WEBVTT

00:12.320 --> 00:14.180
( Both laughing )

00:14.280 --> 00:16.020
Okay,
last lap of the race!

00:16.120 --> 00:18.120
Right turn coming up
on the radar.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.100
Doin' it!

00:19.200 --> 00:20.820
Boost me!

00:20.920 --> 00:23.420
( <i>Engine revs, machine chimes)</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:25.620
Whoa!
Whoa!
What do you think you're doing?

00:25.720 --> 00:26.860
Uhhhhh...
Uhhhhh...

00:26.960 --> 00:28.820
How many times
do I have to explain

00:28.920 --> 00:31.300
what "Authorized Personnel Only"
means?

00:31.400 --> 00:33.460
Are you authorized personnel,
boys?

00:33.560 --> 00:34.980
Are you?

00:35.080 --> 00:37.080
âNo, sir. Sorry, sir.
âNo, sir. Sorry, sir.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.460
Now,
get down and give me 50!

00:37.560 --> 00:39.560
âYes, sir. Sorry, sir.
âYes, sir. Sorry, sir.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.060
Is what I would have said
if you hadn't have gotten

00:42.160 --> 00:45.100
the highest score in "Space
Racer Deluxe" I've ever seen.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.700
You mean
that video game?

00:46.800 --> 00:48.820
That isn't a video game,
boys.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.380
It's a racing simulator for
the Station Racing League!

00:52.480 --> 00:54.500
The Interstation 5000,

00:54.600 --> 00:57.620
an annual competition between
all the stations in the area.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.820
For five years, the Space Bushes
held the Interstation trophy,

01:00.920 --> 01:03.780
but this could be the year
I finally beat Tanner

01:03.880 --> 01:05.100
and win that milk can!

01:05.200 --> 01:08.980
Ohhh, when I feel that milk
pour over my body,

01:09.080 --> 01:12.700
it'll be like I'm born again
as a champion!

01:12.800 --> 01:15.740
I need you boys
to race for me.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.700
âOkay.
âOkay.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.140
Why are we here?

01:18.240 --> 01:19.500
Uh, you're the pit crew.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.580
How are we gonna be
the pit crew?

01:21.680 --> 01:24.020
This is crazy.
Are we gonna get trained?

01:24.120 --> 01:26.440
( Laughs ) You think
I haven't thought of that?

01:27.920 --> 01:29.300
Meet Hans and Lars.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.780
They're our best racers,

01:30.880 --> 01:32.500
or at least they were

01:32.600 --> 01:34.880
until you guys beat their high
score in the racing simulator.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.220
( German accent ) What?
These nobodies beat our score?

01:37.320 --> 01:38.540
That's impossible!

01:38.640 --> 01:39.780
Well,
it was an accident.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.880
Yeah, we didn't know
it was gonna be that easy.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.060
( Slurps, spits )
Easy?!

01:43.160 --> 01:44.260
Did you say "easy"?

01:44.360 --> 01:46.380
Aw, now, don't get all sour,
Larsy.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.480
Everyone loses their edge
at some point.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.860
Edge?!
We have edge.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.140
Yeah,
look at the edges.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.540
( Shing! )

01:52.640 --> 01:53.980
We were born to race.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.040
And that's why you're gonna
teach Mordecai, Rigby,

01:56.120 --> 01:57.700
and their crew
everything you know.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.980
No. No, no, no, no, no.
<i>Nein, nein.</i>
<i>Nein.</i>

02:00.080 --> 02:01.460
We do not "teach."

02:01.560 --> 02:03.560
Well, you certainly haven't

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
brought home the milk can
for me in years,

02:04.600 --> 02:06.660
so I think it's time
to try something new.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.140
Rawls, wait!

02:08.240 --> 02:09.780
Just get 'em ready
for the big race.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.220
Hooah!

02:11.320 --> 02:12.300
So, what's first?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.220
What's first is us.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.940
We are always first.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.580
Get it through
your little head.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.660
We have better things to do
than babysit you babies.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.820
Yeah,
my cappuccino's now cold,

02:22.920 --> 02:24.880
and it's going to take me
a while to make a new one.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.220
Sorry.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.180
Okay.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.940
I've always hated
hotâshot racers.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
Well,
what are we gonna do?

02:32.200 --> 02:34.200
I mean, video simulators
are one thing,

02:33.920 --> 02:35.920
but I have no idea what to do
with this big hunk of metal.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.380
Well, I can teach ya.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.980
All: Toothpick Sally?!

02:39.080 --> 02:41.220
Were you under there
the whole time?

02:41.320 --> 02:43.900
Yeah, I grew up
around these tracks.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.540
And first of all,
they're not big hunks of metal.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.580
They're BHM racers.
That's lesson one.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.660
Now, if you do what I say,
I can get you up to speed.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.460
Yeah, but aren't Hans and Lars,
like, the best racers ever?

02:55.560 --> 02:58.120
Yeah, well, who do you think
taught them?

03:00.040 --> 03:01.020
Was it you?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.100
Yes!

03:02.200 --> 03:03.660
Let's just get started.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.640
( Rock music playing )

03:41.320 --> 03:43.400
âYeah! Whoo! ( Laughs )
âAwesome!

03:44.160 --> 03:45.380
They're ready.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.900
Announcer: Welcome to
the Interstation 5000,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.100
sponsored by
Anderson Farms Dairy.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.020
( Both laughing )

03:53.120 --> 03:55.340
That's your best team,
huh, Rawls?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.900
We're getting that can back
to the Space Tree, Tanner!

03:58.000 --> 04:01.560
That milk is gonna be
all over my body.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.260
Huh. Looks like the Space Bush
is a noâshow.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.360
Howdy, losers.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.260
What the heck? You guys
work for the Space Tree.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.260
Not anymore. We're racing
for Herr Tanner now. ( Laughs )

04:14.360 --> 04:16.100
Tanner!
You lousy ââ

04:16.200 --> 04:19.380
May the best team win.
( Laughs evilly )

04:19.480 --> 04:21.860
It's the moment
you've been waiting for, folks.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.180
Racer roll call!

04:24.280 --> 04:25.340
Both: Space Tree, check!

04:25.440 --> 04:26.540
Both: Space Rock, check!

04:26.640 --> 04:28.020
Both: Space Flower, check!

04:28.120 --> 04:29.380
Both: Space Mushroom, <i>hai!</i>

04:29.480 --> 04:30.900
Both: Space Bush, check.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.060
Both: Space Log, check!

04:33.160 --> 04:35.340
( Electricity buzzing )

04:35.440 --> 04:36.980
Anti one straight four.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.080
Anti one straight four,
check.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.660
Initiate track rail gun!

04:41.760 --> 04:43.660
( Electricity buzzes )

04:43.760 --> 04:44.940
( Fwoosh! )

04:54.960 --> 04:59.340
( Beeping )

04:59.440 --> 05:01.440
( Bubble gum pops )

05:04.800 --> 05:06.940
( Fwoosh! )

05:07.040 --> 05:09.040
Aah!
Aah!

05:10.840 --> 05:12.260
Whoa.
Whoa.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
Turn's coming up!

05:15.120 --> 05:17.380
âOpen right!
âOpen right, check!

05:17.480 --> 05:19.700
Looks like Hans and Lars
of Space Bush

05:19.800 --> 05:21.800
have taken the immediate lead

05:21.000 --> 05:22.700
while racers from
Log and Mushroom

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
try to close the gap.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.980
Aah!
Aah!

05:28.080 --> 05:31.420
( Laughs ) Hey, Jolene,
we got some tree boys over here.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.700
Looks like
they could use an arborist.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.700
â( Laughs )
( Bang! )

05:34.800 --> 05:36.740
( Screams )

05:36.840 --> 05:37.940
( All gasp )

05:38.040 --> 05:40.580
We're losing ground!

05:40.680 --> 05:42.780
âHuh?
( Brakes squeal )

05:42.880 --> 05:45.760
( Both screaming )

05:48.920 --> 05:50.920
( Beeping )

05:53.560 --> 05:55.220
Rigby,
what's over this hill?

05:55.320 --> 05:57.340
I don't know.
It's just a bunch of blobs!

05:57.440 --> 05:59.440
âBattening shield.
âBattening shield check!

05:59.360 --> 06:01.060
âTakeshi! <i>Tate!</i>
<i>âTate!</i>

06:01.160 --> 06:02.540
( Fwoosh! )

06:02.640 --> 06:03.980
Dude,
do we have a shield?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.420
I don't know!
I don't see a button for it!

06:06.520 --> 06:09.620
( Asteroids clanging )

06:09.720 --> 06:11.020
What's one little hole,
right?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.120
( Beeping )

06:14.120 --> 06:16.120
Asteroid field!
Asteroid field!

06:16.680 --> 06:17.820
( Both grunt )

06:17.920 --> 06:19.500
I just wanted
to win that milk can!

06:19.600 --> 06:21.180
( Screams )

06:21.280 --> 06:22.140
( Both scream )

06:22.240 --> 06:24.240
Fix the hole!
Fix the hole!

06:23.240 --> 06:24.500
( Panting )
With what?!

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
I don't know!
Just fix it!

06:27.440 --> 06:28.820
( Grunts )

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
( Brakes squealing )

06:34.200 --> 06:35.060
Keep it still!

06:35.160 --> 06:37.160
( Beeping )

06:37.640 --> 06:39.640
( Gasps )

06:42.960 --> 06:45.480
( Beeping )

06:46.640 --> 06:48.980
( Beeping )

06:49.080 --> 06:49.980
I got it!

06:50.080 --> 06:51.140
( Explosion )

06:51.240 --> 06:52.100
What'd you do?!

06:52.200 --> 06:53.220
I didn't do anything!

06:53.320 --> 06:54.860
( Explosion )

06:54.960 --> 06:56.260
( Both scream )

06:56.360 --> 06:58.740
( All gasp )
âPit crew, to your stations!

06:58.840 --> 07:00.580
Mordecai and Rigby,
stand by.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.680
( Helmets powering up )

07:04.600 --> 07:06.600
( Fwoosh! )

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
Entering atmosphere.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.040
( Both scream )

07:20.880 --> 07:22.060
Where's that pit ship?

07:22.160 --> 07:24.060
Right here!

07:24.160 --> 07:26.160
( Screams )

07:29.400 --> 07:30.380
Ow!

07:30.480 --> 07:32.180
Huh?

07:32.280 --> 07:33.780
It's Hans and Lars's
ratchet bot!

07:33.880 --> 07:36.320
They've been sabotaging you
this whole time!

07:37.400 --> 07:39.340
We're getting too close
to the surface!

07:39.440 --> 07:41.440
We got to get out of here!

07:42.400 --> 07:43.620
Hans:
Prepare for core dive.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.720
Core dive, check!

07:48.240 --> 07:51.880
Wow, those guys are really
not living anymore.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.440
( Both screaming )

07:55.840 --> 07:56.740
Oh.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.840
Other racers, coming up!

07:59.760 --> 08:00.980
Car insurance.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.180
Car insurance, check.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.280
( Gun cocks )

08:08.080 --> 08:09.580
âAah!
âUgh!

08:09.680 --> 08:11.680
Announcer: Well, folks,
looks like they've gone

08:11.240 --> 08:14.020
so deep inside the planet's
crust, we've lost the signal.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.860
Nothing to do now but see
who comes out the other side

08:16.960 --> 08:17.820
for the win!

08:17.920 --> 08:19.700
Come on!
Come on!

08:19.800 --> 08:22.100
Core coming up!

08:22.200 --> 08:23.420
We need more speed!

08:23.520 --> 08:25.520
I'm ejecting the body ââ
I think.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.580
Dudes, why are you
being such jerks?

08:31.680 --> 08:33.460
You think you just get to
come into space,

08:33.560 --> 08:34.780
beat us at the simulator,

08:34.880 --> 08:37.340
then expect us to
train you to replace us?

08:37.440 --> 08:39.340
This is about you and us!

08:39.440 --> 08:42.100
( Swoosh! )
âBoth: Aah!

08:42.200 --> 08:43.700
( Both groan )

08:43.800 --> 08:46.580
Hey, Rigby, how'd we beat
their score in the simulator?

08:46.680 --> 08:48.140
Good question,
Mordecai.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.500
Didn't we use a speed stick
and win?

08:50.600 --> 08:52.960
I don't remember.
Let's find out.

08:55.320 --> 08:56.540
( Swoosh! )

08:56.640 --> 08:58.640
( Both scream )

09:02.680 --> 09:04.680
We're getting close
to the finish line!

09:03.960 --> 09:05.140
Uhh!

09:05.240 --> 09:07.340
More speed!

09:07.440 --> 09:09.760
( Grunts )

09:14.040 --> 09:16.420
Faster, Rigby!

09:16.520 --> 09:18.060
Both: Uhhhh!

09:18.160 --> 09:21.240
Uhhh ââ okay!

09:22.520 --> 09:23.780
( Fwoosh! )

09:23.880 --> 09:25.620
Ugh!

09:25.720 --> 09:27.660
( Crash, clatter )

09:27.760 --> 09:29.140
( Both laugh )

09:29.240 --> 09:31.240
Finish line is coming up.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.020
Gravity's pulling us
back in!

09:37.120 --> 09:38.460
We won't get to
the surface!

09:38.560 --> 09:40.560
Our car
is lighter than theirs.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We can make it.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.900
Go!
Get out there!

09:47.000 --> 09:49.600
All right, getting out there,
check!

09:52.400 --> 09:53.260
( Grunts )

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
HmâHmâHm!

10:00.360 --> 10:01.380
Ugh!

10:01.480 --> 10:02.340
Huh!

10:02.440 --> 10:03.300
( Both grunt )

10:03.400 --> 10:04.260
Huh?
Huh?

10:04.360 --> 10:07.940
( Both screaming )

10:08.040 --> 10:09.540
( All cheering )

10:09.640 --> 10:12.380
âWhoa!
âYeah, whoo!
