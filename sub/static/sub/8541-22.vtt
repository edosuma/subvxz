[siren wailing]

00:06.963 --> 00:08.486
Jane.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.013
Jane? Care to join us?

00:13.100 --> 00:15.015
The moon's at perigee

00:15.102 --> 00:16.364
closest to the earth.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.018
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:18.105 --> 00:21.456
Yes, it is,
but the victim is over here.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.718
I know.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.070
Work.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.637
[instrumental music]

00:30.552 --> 00:32.293
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

00:32.380 --> 00:33.772
Victim's name's Eleanor Artega,
shot in the chest.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.035
There were reports of gunshots
around 11:00.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.601
[Lisbon]
'Is she from the neighborhood?'

00:36.688 --> 00:37.994
[Cho]
'ID gives an
address across town.'

00:38.081 --> 00:39.256
'But one of the
Sac PD officers said'

00:39.343 --> 00:40.866
'she grew up
in the neighborhood.'

00:40.953 --> 00:42.738
Her mother runs a grocery
a few blocks away.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.741
Pretty dress. Maybe she was
coming from some kind of event.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.438
- Wedding?
- Performance, more like it.

00:47.525 --> 00:50.398
She's a musician. Some kind
of stringed instrument.

00:50.485 --> 00:53.140
- Because?
- Calluses on her fingertips.

00:53.227 --> 00:56.273
And the faint piney scent
of rosin on her dress.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.275
Been a couple of gang initiation
killings in the area.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.538
Could be another one. I'll talk
to the Sac PD Gang Unit.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.584
- See who's active.
- We'll canvass the looky-loos.

01:03.889 --> 01:04.977
Hydrangea petal.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.720
Interesting decoration
for a gang slaying

01:08.807 --> 01:11.549
unless the crips have
taken up flower arranging

01:11.636 --> 01:13.812
which I can definitely see
the therapeutic benefits of.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.512
- Thank you.
- Evidence, I believe.

01:19.818 --> 01:20.906
Come on.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.650
And I'm looking
for current information

01:25.737 --> 01:27.087
on Norteno Gangs
in the northeast.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.784
Call me back as soon
as possible. Thanks.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.221
- Hey.
- Damn, man!

01:31.308 --> 01:33.310
You see
I'm walking here, right?

01:33.397 --> 01:36.052
- You walked into me.
- Hell I did.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.576
You need to get behind the line.
Police only here.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.056
Trying to find out
who killed that lady?

01:40.143 --> 01:41.318
You know somethin' about it?

01:41.405 --> 01:42.754
Do I look like a snitch
to you?

01:44.147 --> 01:45.148
Keep walkin'.

01:46.715 --> 01:47.933
Go on.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.938
Anything would be useful,
so if you wouldn't mind, just--

01:53.025 --> 01:55.071
Just give us a call
and, uh, thank you very much

01:55.158 --> 01:56.768
for your time.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.814
I know it's slow,
but it's how the work is done.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.381
Yeah, I could point out
someone that knows

02:00.468 --> 02:03.166
something useful
with 25 words or less.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.907
- Oh, really?
- Count 'em.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.392
Evening. I have $100 for
information about the victim.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.828
One hundred dollars.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.786
[indistinct chattering]

02:14.873 --> 02:18.616
Oops. It's not $100.

02:18.703 --> 02:19.835
Just $1..

02:22.664 --> 02:24.666
...for information.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.015
Any takers?

02:30.498 --> 02:32.848
- Twenty five.
- The point being..

02:32.935 --> 02:35.024
The gentleman in the plaid shirt
with the beanie

02:35.111 --> 02:36.939
didn't even consider
raising his hand.

02:37.026 --> 02:40.116
That means he has information
that not even $100 can buy.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.770
Sir? Uh, you in the plaid

02:41.857 --> 02:44.076
we're gonna have to ask you
some questions.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.078
Cho, we got a runner!
Get the car!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.906
Head off around the block!

02:49.908 --> 02:51.867
Someone took my keys.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.957
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Stop the car!

02:55.044 --> 02:56.741
Thanks for the ride, sucker!

03:00.745 --> 03:04.445
Come on, Starsky,
let's go get him. I'll drive.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.794
[indistinct chattering]

03:12.583 --> 03:13.758
Gonna walk home?

[instrumental music]

03:26.336 --> 03:27.207
[instrumental music]

03:30.297 --> 03:32.473
Miss Artega, we're very sorry
for your loss

03:32.560 --> 03:35.171
but we need to ask you some
questions about your daughter.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.434
I have work to do.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.480
Ma'am, what did Eleanor do
for living?

03:39.567 --> 03:42.744
She was a concert violinist
with the orchestra.

03:42.831 --> 03:46.313
Dawn, I sad the first shelf
for these.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.097
Sorry, Miss Artega.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.232
First chair violin.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.408
The concertmaster

03:54.495 --> 03:56.279
second
to the conductor himself.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.064
Youngest in symphony history.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.763
You must have been
very proud.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.808
Proud, yes.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.941
I was her manager.
We were a team.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.293
Do you know why Eleanor was
in the neighborhood last night?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.601
She came here.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.604
She had given a solo
performance, a special event.

04:16.691 --> 04:17.822
She wanted
to tell me about it.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.087
Can you think of anyone
who may have wanted to harm her?

04:22.174 --> 04:23.698
A boyfriend maybe?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.656
She wasn't seeing anyone.
No time.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.921
She used to have a boyfriend.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.967
Orlando Yglesias.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.708
'Gangbanger.'

04:33.795 --> 04:36.276
They dated about a year or so.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.364
Why would he want
to hurt her?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.672
Eleanor broke it off
six months ago.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.500
He wouldn't leave her alone.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.894
He called,
came to the apartment.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.113
We had to get
a restraining order!

04:49.289 --> 04:50.594
Dawn!

04:50.681 --> 04:51.987
Mop!

04:54.511 --> 04:56.992
How am I gonna clean this up?

04:57.079 --> 04:58.123
How am I gonna..

04:59.386 --> 05:01.779
[crying]
Oh, my Ellie!

05:01.866 --> 05:04.260
Oh, my baby.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.959
Why did they do this to you?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.571
Why?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.183
[sobbing]

05:17.055 --> 05:18.492
Hey, boss.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.189
So I confirmed
that Eleanor Artega

05:20.276 --> 05:22.191
played a private event the night
that she was murdered

05:22.278 --> 05:24.193
apparently celebrating
the, uh, recent purchase

05:24.280 --> 05:25.890
by a collector of a, uh..
Wait for it..

05:25.977 --> 05:29.285
"A Brescian
Stradivarius violin."

05:29.372 --> 05:31.331
I'm assuming that's a good one.
What about the boyfriend?

05:31.418 --> 05:34.334
Orlando Yglesias, he's got
a sheet, some low-level stuff.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.813
He runs with a Norteno Gang.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.295
The, uh,
Lincoln Avenue Hermanos.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.559
Eleanor did have
a restraining order on him.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.866
[Lisbon]
'This is the guy that fled
the scene last night.'

05:44.953 --> 05:46.737
The one that Jane
picked out from the crowd.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.218
Call Sac PD Gang Unit.
Tell them we need any help

05:49.305 --> 05:50.437
they can give
finding this guy.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.047
Okay, you got it.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.310

05:55.050 --> 05:57.444
Mmm. Mmm.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.360
Jane?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.798
Jane.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.016
[music continues]

06:05.103 --> 06:06.191
Jane!

06:08.672 --> 06:10.805
We've got a little homicide
investigation going on here.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.197
You care to join us?

06:12.284 --> 06:13.895
Yeah, I'm-I'm a little busy
right now.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.811
Brahms' Concerto in D major.
Eleanor's the soloist.

06:16.898 --> 06:19.466
She's very good,
very elegant, uh, rubato.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.297
Music later.
We have a viable suspect.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.516
The victim's ex-boyfriend.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.910
Meh. Wild goose chase,
I hope.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.651
You hope? Why?

06:30.738 --> 06:33.349
Well, because if it is,
the boyfriend then it's boring

06:33.436 --> 06:37.266
tragic, but dull, which is
to be avoided at all costs.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.530
[music continues]

06:41.618 --> 06:43.098
Where you going?

06:43.185 --> 06:45.796
[music continues]

06:45.883 --> 06:47.058
Jane?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.632
- You Cho?
- That's right.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.547
Beller, Sac PD.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.115
Anthony Rome. I picked him up
on Bellwood in the northwest.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.986
Got your car, too.
It's on its way.

07:02.073 --> 07:04.554
Thanks. Juvenile services is
sending someone to take him in?

07:04.641 --> 07:06.600
They're backed up.
They can't process him

07:06.687 --> 07:08.863
for 48 hours at the least.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.908
Social worker says his mother
passed away.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.606
His father's in jail.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.304
She thinks we should release him
back to his foster family.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.132
What gang put you
up to this?

07:17.219 --> 07:18.699
I don't belong to a gang.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.831
Stealing a cop car,
that's an initiation.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.964
You're jumping in
with somebody. Who?

07:23.051 --> 07:24.618
Beasty Mobb?
True Heights Villains?

07:24.705 --> 07:26.750
Sir, I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.273
Hang on to him.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.797
Juvenile services will
get to him eventually.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.712
Yeah. No, I have
a court appearance today.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.757
I gotta unload him.
He's all yours.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.280
I okayed it
with your boss already.

07:35.367 --> 07:38.719
- You're joking.
- No joke.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.198
Thanks for your help,
Officer Beller.

07:40.285 --> 07:43.463
- We appreciate the assist.
- No problem.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.422
- Boss--
- Sac PD are not babysitters.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.685
He stole your keys.
He's your problem.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.165
Make sure he doesn't take
anything else.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.343
Sir, you gotta believe me
when I say how sorry I am.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.432
- Don't talk.
- No, really, I'm sorry.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.435
Not buying it.
Come on.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.611
- Whatever, punk.
- That's more like it.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.747
[violin music]

08:12.056 --> 08:14.406
Mr. Jane?
Hi, I'm Kieran Carruthers.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.234
The company's
outreach assistant.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.845
Front office said
I might find you here.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.629
You're no bureaucrat.
You're a musician.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.371
[chuckles]
Yes, I'm the principal oboist.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.981
Definitely oboesque.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.333
Concertmaster sits,
uh, here, yes?

08:28.420 --> 08:29.683
- Yes.
- Hmm.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.514
[Jane]
'Interesting bookmark.'

08:34.601 --> 08:35.863
Yeah, looks like
an expensive one.

08:35.950 --> 08:36.994
Really?

08:38.300 --> 08:39.431
Yeah.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.478
[Kieran]
'You know, if you tell me
what you're looking for'

08:42.565 --> 08:44.045
'I might be able to help.'

08:44.132 --> 08:45.525
I'm looking for a killer.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.790
I'm sorry.
Eleanor's killer? Here?

08:49.877 --> 08:52.662
You're musicians,
professional obsessives.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.272
Most kids spend their
teen years having fun.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.839
You spent them practicing
scales.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.537
It's a noble pursuit,
but as a result

08:57.624 --> 08:59.016
you're all a little nutty.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.149
Well, uh, okay, I don't know
if I'd say that.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.238
There's a definite air
of unrest in the room.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.892
- What is that about?
- Right.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.329
We're supposed to start
our season a day after tomorrow.

09:07.416 --> 09:10.245
Opening night, big fund-raising
meet-and-greet with our donors.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.770
Some of us thought we should
postpone because of Eleanor

09:13.857 --> 09:16.251
but the, uh, maestro
didn't agree.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.470
Your conductor, a tyrant?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.734
Vincent Manheiser.
I wouldn't say he's a tyrant.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.954
He's just...not nice.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.695
[Vincent]
'Alright, let's get to work.'

09:25.782 --> 09:26.870
See for yourself.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.046
Come on, people. Let's go.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.919
Haven't got all day.
Up, up, up. Come on.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.573
Alright.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.708
- Constance.
- Yes, maestro?

09:38.795 --> 09:41.058
You will take Eleanor's seat
as concertmaster.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.975
You've not shown any of her
natural gifts of leadership

09:45.062 --> 09:50.764
but under the circumstances,
we shall have to make do, yes?

09:50.851 --> 09:51.895
I'll do my best.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.245
Ariel.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.814
Your keen lust for advancement
will be gratified.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.077
- Second seat for you.
- Yes, maestro.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.604
Alright, everyone, ready.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.823
From the top.

10:06.910 --> 10:07.824
And..

10:09.260 --> 10:10.305
[instrumental music]

10:10.392 --> 10:13.482
And tension. Forte.

10:13.569 --> 10:14.875
[music continues]

10:20.750 --> 10:24.406

else get in the way of that.

of that before you stole a car.

it was important.

have a better life.

was Eleanor into cats?

What about ancient Egypt,
pyramids? Mummies?

- Mm.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.813
- Don't let Vincent see you.
- I think I can take him.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.858
Can I watch?
That was fun last time.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.207
This is not a joke, Ariel.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.601
I'm following up
on an important clue.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.516
It could very well
break the case.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.999
Well, come on.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.089
You're gonna tell us, right?

23:16.786 --> 23:20.137
- He can't, Ariel.
- Oh, we won't say anything.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.704
- Promise.
- I'd like to know.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.491
Well, I suppose you're
gonna hear soon enough.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.759
Eleanor was in a relationship
with someone from the orchestra.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.240
I suspected as much.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.504
- Who was it?
- Uh, I can't..

23:38.591 --> 23:40.462
It couldn't be Douglas,
could it?

23:40.549 --> 23:41.507
[chuckles]

23:41.594 --> 23:43.204
Or Howard?

23:43.291 --> 23:45.249
Think bigger.
That's all I'm saying.

23:48.905 --> 23:49.950
It wasn't..

23:52.909 --> 23:54.215
- No.
- Are you serious?

23:54.302 --> 23:58.045
Deadly.
Mm.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.568
And he was
abusing her..

24:00.830 --> 24:02.484
...sexually.

24:02.571 --> 24:05.182
- That's awful.
- Yes. Shh.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.795
- Oh, my..
- I don't see it.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.972
[indistinct chattering]

24:22.025 --> 24:23.940
[male #1]
'ID, please.'

24:24.027 --> 24:26.508
[Cho]
Mr. Rome, I'm Kimball Cho
with the CBI.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.075
Your son Anthony
tells me you're innocent

24:28.162 --> 24:30.207
of the charge you're facing.
Is that true?

24:30.294 --> 24:31.992
- Anthony told you that?
- Yeah.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.515
How you know my son?

24:33.602 --> 24:35.430
That's not important
right now.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.693
Why the hell do you care
about any of this?

24:37.780 --> 24:39.390
I'm giving you a chance to say
you didn't do the crime.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.262
- You're not gonna take it?
- No. No, I didn't do it.

24:41.349 --> 24:42.872
DA says you did.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.353
Yeah, a store owner picked me
out of a lineup.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.876
Bad witness ID. That's all.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.617
But you know how hard
that is to beat, right?

24:48.704 --> 24:51.402
And you've robbed
a lot of stores, haven't you?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.230
Not anymore.
That is all behind me.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.885
Since when?

24:55.972 --> 24:59.149
[sighs]
Since Anthony's mother
passed about a year ago.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.456
I've been trying to step up,
do better.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.458
Look, I even got
a new construction job.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.242
And you run with
the South Side Mafia.

25:07.114 --> 25:10.030
How do they feel
about you stepping up?

25:10.117 --> 25:12.641
I'm jumping out as soon
as I put all this behind me.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.948
You've had a year to jump out.
What are you waiting for?

25:15.035 --> 25:16.558
Man, the hell with you!

25:16.645 --> 25:17.951
You don't know me!

25:19.822 --> 25:23.304
DA offered you two years. You
could do that much time easily.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.045
Why'd you turn it down?

25:25.132 --> 25:27.874
Two years of my boy in foster
care, out there on the streets?

25:27.961 --> 25:30.137
He would be dead
or in a cell with me.

25:30.224 --> 25:35.055
No. I been gone too long.
I have got to get outta here.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.191
Tell me about
Jayden Stephens.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.896
- I got your message.
- Just in time.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.724
- The fun will soon begin.
- What's going on?

25:51.811 --> 25:54.683
Ahem. It's just horrible,
isn't it?

25:54.770 --> 25:55.728
What is, ma'am?

25:55.815 --> 25:58.513
Our conductor..

25:58.600 --> 26:00.733
...has been having
an illicit relationship

26:00.820 --> 26:02.604
with our poor, dear Eleanor.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.215
- No.
- Yes.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.740
And he hit her.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.611
[gasps]

26:09.698 --> 26:12.745
- Allison! Excuse me.
- You're excused.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.137
[clicks tongue]

26:14.224 --> 26:17.532
- You. Why?
- Lure out the real lover.

26:19.273 --> 26:20.709
Oops. Gotta go.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.803
Someone in the orchestra
had a passionate

26:27.890 --> 26:29.457
and unrequited
crush on Eleanor.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.242
- And you know this because?
- Cats and Egypt.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.548
Eleanor wasn't into them.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.289
The bookmark. she didn't
buy it for herself

26:35.376 --> 26:37.421
and it's too expensive
for a casual gift.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.468
Someone was trying very hard
to impress her.

26:40.555 --> 26:43.166
Now thanks to the rumor mill,
that person thinks

26:43.253 --> 26:44.559
that Vincent was sleeping
with Eleanor.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.734
Add in a couple of glasses
of champagne

26:45.821 --> 26:47.475
and if I haven't missed
the mark..

26:47.562 --> 26:50.739
You son of a bitch. How could
you do that to Eleanor?

26:50.826 --> 26:52.219
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.612
- 'Don't lie to me.'
- Here we go.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.309
Go home and sober up.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.572
[Constance grunting]

26:57.659 --> 26:59.095
[Vincent grunting]

26:59.182 --> 27:01.184
That's enough!
Get off of him! Come on!

27:01.271 --> 27:04.840
Now. Break it up!
Break it up now!

27:04.927 --> 27:07.234
Break it up.

27:07.321 --> 27:11.238
- Oh!
- Break it up! Enough! Enough!

27:11.325 --> 27:14.067
Let me know if you need me
to call for backup.

27:14.154 --> 27:17.287
It's alright. Oh! Hey! Get..
I said, get your hands off!

27:24.294 --> 27:27.950
Constance, we know you bought
Eleanor that bookmark.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.909
We found the charge
on your credit card records.

27:31.562 --> 27:32.955
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

27:34.522 --> 27:37.394
Yes, I was.

27:37.481 --> 27:38.439
When did you tell her?

27:40.746 --> 27:43.226
A few weeks ago.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.925
She was really, really nice

27:46.012 --> 27:46.926
but..

27:48.231 --> 27:49.668
...she wasn't interested.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.930
Did that upset you?

27:52.758 --> 27:54.368
I suppose a little.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.893
Mm. You have a temper,
don't you?

27:57.980 --> 27:59.939
No. Hardly at all.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.506
Oh, you got pretty angry
at Vincent.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.291
That was different.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.988
I-I thought..

28:06.075 --> 28:07.773
I heard Vincent hurt Eleanor.

28:07.860 --> 28:11.254
I...I didn't think
that was right.

28:11.341 --> 28:12.995
And what about
the night Eleanor died?

28:14.127 --> 28:15.476
Did you have a temper then?

28:17.260 --> 28:18.958
You knew she was playing
that night.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.437
It wouldn't have been
that hard to follow her.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.613
You can't be serious.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.442
I don't think the fact
that Vincent had abused Eleanor

28:25.529 --> 28:27.662
is what upset you.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.273
I think you couldn't stand her
being with somebody else.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.622
No.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.276
Alright, then explain this
for me then.

28:40.849 --> 28:44.026
Why was the gun that killed
Eleanor in your car?

28:44.113 --> 28:45.549
What?

28:45.636 --> 28:48.117
A few hours ago,
we found it in your trunk.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.079
That isn't mine.
It's..

28:53.166 --> 28:55.298
Th-that's not mine.
It-it isn't.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.866
That's not really an explanation
of how it got there.

28:59.650 --> 29:04.090
I..
I-I want a lawyer.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.308
Please.

29:07.093 --> 29:09.008
[instrumental
"Concerto In D Major"]

29:18.669 --> 29:21.890
[clears throat]
So...Constance.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.937
- We're charging her.
- Then we can all rest easy.

29:25.589 --> 29:26.895
Mm.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.901
- Say it.
- She didn't do it.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.338
We found the weapon
in her car.

29:35.425 --> 29:36.992
Didn't do it.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.690
Unless you have actual evidence
that exonerates her

29:39.778 --> 29:41.127
we have to charge her.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.172
If she were the killer,
she would have exhibited

29:43.259 --> 29:44.695
some measure of guilt.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.872
All I observed was
sincere grief.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.224
Actual evidence.

29:52.921 --> 29:55.663
Okay. The gauntlet's
been thrown down.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.277
When you searched Constance's
car, did you notice any flowers?

30:01.364 --> 30:04.193
- No. Why?
- She's all yours.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.720
Hey, Osvaldo.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.766
How's it going
in the DA's office?

30:11.853 --> 30:15.161
Not so good. We need
to talk about Agent Cho.

30:15.248 --> 30:18.817
Ardiles is prosecuting Rome.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.775
I'm told you visited Rome
in jail. Is that true?

30:20.862 --> 30:22.864
- Why do you wanna know?
- Why do..

30:26.346 --> 30:28.739
Uh, because Mr. Rome's lawyer
has sent me an updated

30:28.827 --> 30:32.134
witness list with the name
Jayden Stephens on it

30:32.221 --> 30:34.180
which is interesting,
because as far as I can tell

30:34.267 --> 30:36.095
Jayden Stephens
is a convenient figment

30:36.182 --> 30:37.618
of Mr. Rome's imagination.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.402
But now according
to Mr. Rome's lawyer

30:39.489 --> 30:42.057
even though you have
nothing to do with this

30:42.144 --> 30:44.059
you said you'd track down
this Mr. Stephens

30:44.146 --> 30:46.061
thereby providing Mr. Rome
with an alibi

30:46.148 --> 30:47.802
potentially screwing my case.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.460
That's why I need to know,
Agent Cho.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.853
Answer him.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.031
Yes, I did that.

31:02.121 --> 31:03.209
Agent, do you know who, uh

31:03.296 --> 31:04.297
Asante James
and Rodrick Pierce are?

31:05.776 --> 31:07.953
No.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.824
Well, they're only
the, uh, top two lieutenants

31:09.911 --> 31:10.999
in the South Side Mafia.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.959
Probably a dozen
bodies on each.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.135
Lawrence Rome
worked with them.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.050
You want Lawrence to flip?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.878
- Well, that's the idea.
- Lawrence won't flip.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.705
- Really? Why not?
- He knows they'd kill him.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.490
Right. And you know so much
about that?

31:23.577 --> 31:24.795
More than you, I guess.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.930
Agent, do I have to take this
upstairs? Because I'm ready.

31:29.017 --> 31:32.064
No, you don't.
Hey, this is not our case.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.544
Rome's attorney
or the DA's office

31:34.631 --> 31:36.242
can look
for Jayden Stephens.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.547
We should not get involved.

31:40.637 --> 31:41.595
Good.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.468
Then we're in agreement.

31:45.555 --> 31:48.732
We shouldn't get involved.
Got it.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.138
Where's the kid?

just took him.

Man, let go of me!'

32:12.669 --> 32:15.585
Easy, son, easy. What's up?

32:15.672 --> 32:17.631
I'm Agent Cho. I'll take
the kid off your hands.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.241
- What?
- I made a mistake.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.721
Let's just
forget I filed a report, okay?

32:20.808 --> 32:22.462
Too late.
Paperwork's been filed.

32:22.549 --> 32:25.421
It's my case now. Besides,
it took me an hour to get here.

32:25.508 --> 32:28.729
I'm not going back
empty-handed. Now do you mind?

32:28.816 --> 32:29.991
[grunts]
Oh!

32:30.078 --> 32:32.515
- Hey, hey.
- Give him to me.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.474
Sorry. Can't do that.

32:34.561 --> 32:37.216
- He hit you. That's battery.
- Are you kidding me?

32:37.303 --> 32:38.478
I have to process him now.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.175
- Paperwork.
- Hold on.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.438
- Bye.
- Hey. This is bull!

32:42.525 --> 32:43.657
What are you doing, man?

or I'll give you back.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.029
I thought the police work
was over.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.901
Oh, I just stopped by
to congratulate you.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.816
I'm sorry. Me?

33:12.903 --> 33:15.558
You are the new concertmaster,
aren't you?

33:15.645 --> 33:17.865
Now that Constance
is in the pokey.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.476
Thanks.

33:20.563 --> 33:24.132
It's not exactly something
that deserves congratulations.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.655
When you heard about
the promotion, what was

33:25.742 --> 33:27.831
the first thought
that popped into your head?

33:28.919 --> 33:32.097
Sadness...relief.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.012
You know, just last week
I was thinking of leaving here

33:34.099 --> 33:35.274
and trying my luck elsewhere.

33:36.927 --> 33:37.928
- Now..
- Mm.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.453
Well, you got
what you wanted.

33:42.150 --> 33:45.197
You're pleased
and...yet you feel guilty.

33:45.284 --> 33:48.591
It's perfectly
understandable.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.724
I need to get back
to rehearsing.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.682
Don't mind me.

34:01.604 --> 34:03.215
[violin music]

34:08.785 --> 34:10.700
Excuse me.

Do you know if there's
a good florist nearby?

34:13.399 --> 34:15.053

34:20.710 --> 34:22.147
- 'What up, Jay?'
- 'What up, Jay?'

34:27.978 --> 34:31.504
- Jayden Stephens?
- Who wants to know?

34:31.591 --> 34:33.636
Hey, CBI.
Let me see your hands.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.812
Alright.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.118
We're gonna talk
about Lawrence Rome.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.425
We can talk. Let's talk.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.471
[dramatic music]

34:48.521 --> 34:50.914
[grunts]

34:51.001 --> 34:52.742
Give me your arms.
Give me your arms!

34:58.096 --> 34:59.619
[Jayden]
'What did I do?'

35:00.489 --> 35:01.621
Get up!

35:01.708 --> 35:03.840
[grunts]

35:03.927 --> 35:05.407
What the hell's
going on here?

35:05.494 --> 35:07.105
- Get out of the way.
- Or what?

35:07.192 --> 35:09.063
[grunts]

35:09.150 --> 35:11.326
Keep breathing.
You'll be fine.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.118
For you.

35:21.989 --> 35:26.950
- Does it squirt water?
- No. No trick.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.822
Maybe just a little trick.
Catch the killer.

35:28.909 --> 35:29.997
- With a hydrangea?
- Yeah.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.651
How?

35:31.738 --> 35:33.218
Well, wouldn't that
be spoiling the fun?

35:33.305 --> 35:35.263
For you.
Spoiling the fun for you.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.960
That's the fun
that matters.

35:42.575 --> 35:43.793
[instrumental music]

35:49.712 --> 35:52.062
We're dropping charges
against Lawrence Rome.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.937
[sighs]
I see.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.939
And personally,
I think the alibi is bogus

35:59.026 --> 36:01.507
but we had to interview
the store owner again.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.596
'Now he says, uh,
maybe his ID was wrong.'

36:03.683 --> 36:06.251
'Maybe it wasn't
Lawrence Rome.'

36:06.338 --> 36:07.774
Whole thing's
gone down the toilet.

36:09.819 --> 36:11.778
- We had an agreement.
- I agreed I shouldn't help.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.867
Didn't say I wouldn't.

36:13.954 --> 36:17.566
From now on, you get nothing
from the DA's office.

36:17.653 --> 36:20.047
No favors, no help,
and not just you

36:20.134 --> 36:22.615
'but every agent
in this unit.'

36:22.702 --> 36:25.487
You have screwed things
for your people, my friend.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.315
Six months from now,
Lawrence Rome will be

36:27.402 --> 36:29.317
back inside for ripping off
another liquor store

36:29.404 --> 36:31.276
his kid'll be back
in foster care

36:31.363 --> 36:33.365
and the South Side Mafia
will be stronger than ever.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.758
You're wrong.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.022
You wanna bet on that?

36:44.376 --> 36:46.508
[instrumental
"Symphony No. 6 In B Minor"]

37:03.308 --> 37:05.832
[no audio]

37:08.400 --> 37:10.315
on the stage, either side
of the stairs.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.592
Oh, no, no, no, no!

37:26.679 --> 37:30.160
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Kieran!

37:30.248 --> 37:33.425
You're my rock! Never
a wrong note. What is going on?

37:33.512 --> 37:36.254
I'm sorry, maestro, just..
I'm not feeling very well.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.429
What is the matter?

37:38.560 --> 37:40.954
I can answer that.

37:41.041 --> 37:44.000
- What's he doing here?
- Fabulous suit, by the way.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.655
Kieran's not so much feeling
sick as he is feeling guilty.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.267
Sick with guilt because it was
him that killed Eleanor.

37:50.877 --> 37:53.575
[laughs]
Come on.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.490
Hydrangeas don't lie.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.363
[laughs]

37:58.450 --> 38:00.930
Well, if they could speak,
they wouldn't lie.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.454
What are you talking about?

38:02.541 --> 38:04.804
Somebody gave Eleanor
a bouquet of hydrangeas

38:04.891 --> 38:06.284
the night of the murder.

38:09.156 --> 38:12.115
[Lisbon]
After you shot
Eleanor, you swiped them

38:13.726 --> 38:15.423
leaving behind a single petal.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.122
[Jane]
'And when you saw them,
you couldn't help'

38:19.209 --> 38:20.733
remembering that night.

38:20.820 --> 38:24.737
You felt guilty.
It killed your concentration.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.827
Come on. Constance killed her.
You found the gun in her car.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.656
- Because you framed her.
- 'Precisely.'

38:30.743 --> 38:33.136
The question remains,
why would a man kill

38:33.223 --> 38:37.880
the first chair violinist and
then frame the second chair?

38:37.967 --> 38:39.534
Because with the first
and second chair

38:39.621 --> 38:42.015
out of the picture,
the third takes first.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.451
Ariel.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.279
Kieran here has
a little crush on you.

38:45.366 --> 38:48.195
Well, let's not beat
around the bush here, Kieran.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.328
It's more of an obsession.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.372
He'd heard
that you'd been thinking

38:51.459 --> 38:53.418
about leaving the orchestra.

38:53.505 --> 38:57.160
Then he would lose you.
So he had to shake things up.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.032
- Kieran?
- It's not true.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.033
Okay, this is because
I played a few wrong notes?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.730
This is crazy!

39:01.817 --> 39:03.210
He told you that you'd
eventually

39:03.297 --> 39:04.864
become first chair,
didn't he?

39:04.951 --> 39:08.171
It was just a feeling
that he had, a little hunch.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.477
He always had faith in you.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.220
- Ariel.
- You stay away from me.

39:13.307 --> 39:14.656
Wait, Ariel, wait.
No, no. Wait. Wait.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.354
- Ariel, listen. No, Ariel.
- Calm down.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.965
Ariel! Ariel, wait! No! Listen!
I just want to make you happy!

39:19.052 --> 39:21.359
- 'That is enough.'
- Maestro, take five.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.970
- Okay.
- Break, everyone.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.320
Eleanor was nothing
compared to Ariel.

39:26.407 --> 39:29.105
She didn't have
the technique.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.499
So after rehearsal that night,
I followed Eleanor

39:31.586 --> 39:33.022
to her performance.

39:35.024 --> 39:37.070
[dramatic music]

39:52.564 --> 39:54.740
Why'd you take the flowers?

39:54.827 --> 39:58.221
He didn't think Eleanor deserved
them. Isn't that right?

39:58.308 --> 40:00.267
Ariel is
ten times the player.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.269
Shedeserved
the recognition.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.274
If I had to give it to her..

40:07.361 --> 40:09.450
...so be it.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.234
Very gallant.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.933
Still, I wouldn't expect
a conjugal.

40:18.851 --> 40:22.028
Dad!

40:22.115 --> 40:23.899
[both laughing]

40:23.986 --> 40:25.597
- Oh, what's up, man?
- Oh.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.555
[laughs]

40:27.642 --> 40:30.863
- I missed you so much.
- Oh! Look at you.

40:30.950 --> 40:33.039
God, look at you.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.563
Come on.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.130
I missed you.

40:37.217 --> 40:38.871
[both chuckles]

40:38.958 --> 40:40.176
Lawrence.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.920
Alright.
Give me a minute.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.444
Okay.

40:49.229 --> 40:50.926
I talked to the Gang Unit.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.754
If you haven't jumped out
in a month, they'll let me know.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.887
I said I would.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.847
You have a chance.
Don't mess it up.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.850
What's this punk
saying to you, dad?

41:01.937 --> 41:05.245
Easy. Easy, little man.
We just-we just talking.

41:05.332 --> 41:09.815
Hey, Cho. We got a new one.
We're heading out in a minute.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.512
Thanks, Mr. Rigsby.

41:11.599 --> 41:12.992
I really appreciate
everything.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.907
Uh, yeah. Um, no problem.

41:21.130 --> 41:23.393
That was weird.
I barely talked to the kid.

41:25.004 --> 41:26.135
Check your pockets.

41:28.442 --> 41:31.532
My wallet. Damn it!

41:31.619 --> 41:33.055
Hold the elevator!

41:34.666 --> 41:35.884
[chuckles]

41:38.408 --> 41:39.845
Mind if I..

41:45.459 --> 41:46.852
