WEBVTT

00:01.093 --> 00:02.974
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:02.975 --> 00:04.014
Shit!

00:07.780 --> 00:09.300
Can you just take a breath?

00:09.301 --> 00:11.783
My family is falling apart.
I cannot sleep.

00:11.784 --> 00:15.226
So I don't have time to take
a fucking breath, okay?!

00:15.227 --> 00:16.588
This is destroying us.

00:16.589 --> 00:18.269
I need you to do something about it!

00:18.270 --> 00:20.912
We should discuss

00:20.913 --> 00:23.795
consummating the marriage vows tonight.

00:23.796 --> 00:26.798
This house is still marime.

00:26.799 --> 00:28.479
In my family,

00:28.480 --> 00:31.763
the mourning period
to purify a house is 40 days.

00:31.764 --> 00:33.565
In the Ranko family,

00:33.566 --> 00:36.568
we mourn for a fortnight.

00:36.569 --> 00:39.250
A fortnight it is.

00:39.251 --> 00:40.371
Good.

00:40.372 --> 00:44.495
We share something... special.

00:44.496 --> 00:48.500
She thought that maybe you and I
could learn from each other.

00:48.501 --> 00:50.181
What was your name, again?

00:50.182 --> 00:51.262
Paz.

00:51.263 --> 00:52.864
It means "peace."

00:52.865 --> 00:54.185
Of course it does.

00:54.186 --> 00:56.027
I need 5 grand.

00:56.028 --> 00:57.468
What for?

00:57.469 --> 01:00.351
It's what it costs to
keep her apartment.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.634
Fucking comes out of nowhere,
doesn't it?

01:02.635 --> 01:06.518
It goes good, it goes bad,
goes every which way.

01:06.519 --> 01:08.239
And then it goes away.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.362
If I do this... this is my shop.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.605
And you don't get a cut.

01:13.606 --> 01:16.167
I don't work for you.

01:16.168 --> 01:17.809
I work with you.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.450
We are partners.

01:19.451 --> 01:21.052
Convinced me.

01:23.896 --> 01:25.817
Shit.

01:25.818 --> 01:27.499
I am in the wrong business.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:51.524 --> 03:54.365
A little smaller.
I got it.

03:54.366 --> 03:56.247
But not too small,
otherwise it won't seal.

03:56.248 --> 03:57.429
Dad, I got it.

03:58.050 --> 03:59.264
It's the one.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.898
So that's it? We're done now?

04:06.899 --> 04:09.220
No. No.

04:09.221 --> 04:11.584
You didn't think you'd get off
that easy, did you?

04:13.866 --> 04:15.907
I've been thinking
about that little scam

04:15.908 --> 04:17.589
you pulled with your Aunt.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.951
Mom already gave me hell about this,
Dad.

04:19.952 --> 04:21.753
I'm not giving you hell, Nick.

04:21.754 --> 04:23.595
I want to give you an opportunity.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.436
I don't know if Mom told you,

04:25.437 --> 04:30.401
but we're opening up a new shop,
expanding the Haverford empire.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.283
Mom will run this one,

04:32.284 --> 04:36.447
and I'll cover the new shop
we're leasing at a strip mall.

04:36.448 --> 04:38.369
Fonso's mall?

04:38.370 --> 04:40.932
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.375
I thought that you were done with Fonso?

04:44.657 --> 04:47.580
Dad, I'm not deaf, okay?

04:49.822 --> 04:52.705
I'm done working for Fonso,
if that's what you mean.

04:54.466 --> 04:56.348
We just pay rent.

05:01.410 --> 05:02.914
This is our shop, Nick.

05:02.915 --> 05:04.435
I don't know.

05:04.436 --> 05:06.838
It's... It's kind of the weekend, Dad.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.920
I'll pay you.

05:08.921 --> 05:12.283
You're old enough to, uh,
make your own money now.

05:12.284 --> 05:13.525
How much?

05:13.526 --> 05:15.727
How much? Whatever the hell I say.

05:15.728 --> 05:17.610
Get your ass in the car. How much.

05:22.895 --> 05:24.455
Oh, hey, can I give you a hand?

05:24.456 --> 05:26.518
I'm almost done.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.542
Good news... we got the couch back.

05:30.543 --> 05:33.065
Yep.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.348
Let me take this out for you.

05:37.349 --> 05:38.572
I got it.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.396
Listen.
I started the hose, refilling the pool.

05:45.397 --> 05:47.118
It'll take a couple of hours.

05:47.119 --> 05:49.601
Uh, just try to keep an eye out.

05:49.602 --> 05:51.883
Turn it off before it overflows.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.926
Where are you gonna be?

05:54.927 --> 05:57.048
Uh, we're heading to the new shop.

05:57.049 --> 06:00.131
I talked Nick into helping me set it up.

06:00.132 --> 06:02.333
Right. Your grand plan.

06:02.334 --> 06:04.976
Our grand plan.
Our grand plan.

06:04.977 --> 06:08.139
Where I've been given the role
of Madame Linda, Palm Reader.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.742
I know it's been a while since
you've done your own readings.

06:10.743 --> 06:12.904
No, no, no.
I'm not afraid to do my part.

06:12.905 --> 06:15.346
I... I... No, I didn't say that.

06:15.347 --> 06:19.671
I'm afraid that you have
no idea what you've gotten into.

06:19.672 --> 06:22.514
Oh, I can handle Fonso.

06:22.515 --> 06:26.358
Right.

06:29.161 --> 06:31.042
Good morning, Mrs. Marks.

06:31.043 --> 06:32.501
Sophie.

07:27.860 --> 07:30.542
Good morning, LaLa.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.984
Good morning, Drina.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.146
Tony.

07:35.147 --> 07:36.267
Morning.

07:36.268 --> 07:37.566
Hi, Grandma.

07:46.639 --> 07:48.680
Drina!

07:48.681 --> 07:50.361
Tonight's the big night,

07:50.362 --> 07:53.324
so we've got you
a little something special

07:53.325 --> 07:55.367
for the occasion.

07:57.129 --> 07:58.670
Go ahead, open it.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.653
What's the matter? Go on.

08:01.654 --> 08:03.055
Don't be rude.

08:22.154 --> 08:24.115
Ooh, sexy!

08:24.116 --> 08:26.758
Oh, it's elegant.
Nice, right?

08:26.759 --> 08:28.960
She should look good.

08:29.284 --> 08:30.994
Drina?

08:33.038 --> 08:35.407
Let me talk to her.
Mm-hmm.

08:39.091 --> 08:41.254
Excuse me.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.818
Your wife's getting on my nerves.

08:50.262 --> 08:52.584
Now, what's the matter with you?

08:52.585 --> 08:54.827
I was gonna give her the present.

08:57.149 --> 08:59.071
I'm the man of the house now.

09:01.033 --> 09:04.155
You just worry about doing your duty.

09:04.156 --> 09:05.277
Okay?

09:15.728 --> 09:18.129
There's no way I'm putting that on.

09:18.130 --> 09:20.091
Put it on. Don't put it on.

09:20.669 --> 09:22.373
You're married now.

09:22.374 --> 09:25.056
And marriages must be consummated.

09:25.057 --> 09:27.384
This is the custom.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.101
Breaking news.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.846
Customs suck.

09:32.224 --> 09:34.345
Why do you think I push you so

09:34.346 --> 09:36.810
toward custom and tradition, hmm?

09:37.870 --> 09:39.070
Because you're old.

09:39.071 --> 09:40.552
Well, that might be.

09:40.553 --> 09:44.716
But with age comes
wisdom and experience.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.559
Which youth can choose to learn from.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.682
Or choose to suffer without.

09:51.783 --> 09:56.407
In our tradition,
it is the male that wears the crown.

09:56.408 --> 09:57.649
That provides for the family.

09:57.650 --> 09:58.890
That fights for the family.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.371
That guides the family.

10:00.372 --> 10:03.014
And the sooner you accept that,
the better.

10:03.015 --> 10:04.495
We can never be the king.

10:04.496 --> 10:06.137
This is our tradition.

10:06.138 --> 10:09.741
But it doesn't mean we cannot rule.

10:10.301 --> 10:13.264
Be a good Roma wife.

10:13.638 --> 10:14.866
And one day...

10:14.867 --> 10:16.187
Aah!

10:16.188 --> 10:18.226
The family is yours.

10:29.441 --> 10:30.843
Grab what you can.

10:42.014 --> 10:45.057
We provide a valuable service.

10:47.505 --> 10:49.781
If people didn't want
what we had to offer,

10:51.092 --> 10:53.264
they wouldn't pay for it.

10:59.672 --> 11:01.793
We help them focus,

11:01.794 --> 11:03.980
to achieve their hopes and dreams.

11:05.477 --> 11:09.641
With the help of a $500 candle?

11:09.642 --> 11:12.822
The more expensive it is,
the more they value it.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.487
Son, $500 is a small price to pay

11:16.488 --> 11:18.953
to make your dreams come true.

11:19.411 --> 11:21.252
This is not my style.

11:21.253 --> 11:23.174
I pretty much stick with Tarot.

11:23.175 --> 11:26.938
But we're bringing on
some new psychics soon,

11:26.939 --> 11:30.902
for seance work
and crystal ball sessions.

11:30.903 --> 11:32.824
Press it.

11:43.895 --> 11:45.797
I'll be damned.

11:45.798 --> 11:46.981
What?

11:49.121 --> 11:51.724
I used to make a lot of money
with this deck.

11:53.966 --> 11:55.527
Playing poker?

11:55.528 --> 11:57.690
Any fool can gamble.

12:16.711 --> 12:18.309
Can you teach me how to do that?

12:18.310 --> 12:20.872
No, no, no, no. Maybe later.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.515
I'll finish unpacking these boxes first.

13:20.252 --> 13:23.014
And you're here for a Couples Reading,
right?

13:23.015 --> 13:24.816
Yes, we are.

13:24.817 --> 13:26.538
We're actually getting married
in the fall.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.260
Oh, well, then. Congratulations.

13:29.261 --> 13:30.862
You're smart to do this now.

13:30.863 --> 13:32.423
The first time I got a look at
my husband's palm,

13:32.424 --> 13:33.545
we were already married.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.798
The things I saw.

13:37.429 --> 13:40.031
You two have quite a chemistry.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.262
Hm.

13:42.474 --> 13:44.796
Have you ever used sandalwood oil?

13:45.224 --> 13:48.520
I think it would be a nice
enhancement for your reading.

13:48.521 --> 13:50.441
When used in Love Magic,

13:50.442 --> 13:54.085
it is thought to promote
elevated arousal.

13:54.086 --> 13:55.446
Not that you two seem to need that.

13:57.089 --> 14:01.092
Rose or honeysuckle can be added
for a lasting commitment.

14:01.491 --> 14:04.816
To ensure an enduring love.

14:05.662 --> 14:08.299
How much is all this gonna cost?

14:08.873 --> 14:12.264
$100 for the reading,
$50 for the enhancements.

14:16.428 --> 14:20.191
We'll just take the palm reading,
if that's okay.

14:20.635 --> 14:22.354
Sure.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.958
All right.

14:26.959 --> 14:29.161
Dominant hands, please.

14:34.647 --> 14:38.851
You both have strong heart lines,
you see?

14:40.405 --> 14:42.894
You have a very deep connection.

14:42.895 --> 14:44.492
I can see that.

14:47.900 --> 14:51.022
I do see, though, I see breaks.

14:51.457 --> 14:55.066
I see detours and interruptions.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.171
Does that make sense?

15:00.553 --> 15:04.036
Your relationship got off to
a rocky start.

15:06.759 --> 15:09.521
One of you was involved with another.

15:10.184 --> 15:11.769
Guilty.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.567
She broke it off.

15:15.568 --> 15:18.410
We've been happy ever since.

15:21.574 --> 15:23.031
Hmm.

15:24.376 --> 15:25.783
I see...

15:27.201 --> 15:29.370
doubt in you.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.290
A secret.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.668
Something...
Something you've tried to bury.

15:43.596 --> 15:47.679
It wasn't the neighbor
who dinged your car.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.360
I knew it was you.

15:49.361 --> 15:51.803
You're a terrible driver.
That's no secret.

15:51.804 --> 15:54.365
It's not that. It's, uh...

15:57.369 --> 15:59.010
Betrayal.

15:59.011 --> 16:00.318
Guilt.

16:01.402 --> 16:03.455
Memories.

16:05.057 --> 16:09.220
The other woman moved on.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.223
I think you need to take a long,
sober look

16:12.224 --> 16:14.225
at your life and your relationship

16:15.124 --> 16:17.376
and you need to decide...

16:19.754 --> 16:22.274
if this is what you want.

16:24.997 --> 16:26.317
We're done.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.879
You can put your money in the box.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.240
Wait, that's it?

16:29.241 --> 16:30.515
I'm afraid so.

16:31.163 --> 16:33.444
Good luck to both of you.

16:40.573 --> 16:42.974
I have somewhere to be.

17:36.709 --> 17:38.109
Gina?

17:43.636 --> 17:44.796
Jesus!

17:44.797 --> 17:46.357
What the fuck?!

17:46.358 --> 17:47.799
Fucking naked in here!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.594
In my apartment!

17:50.202 --> 17:52.555
You paid for it with my money.

17:53.445 --> 17:55.608
That makes it mine.

17:58.651 --> 18:00.291
I told you things.

18:00.292 --> 18:01.933
So what?

18:01.934 --> 18:03.733
I told you things.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.319
Who gives a fuck?

18:07.945 --> 18:10.101
You know what this place means to me.

18:10.102 --> 18:12.575
Your obsession is unhealthy.

18:14.066 --> 18:15.346
Fuck off.

18:18.190 --> 18:20.793
And I'll take my key.

18:51.784 --> 18:53.304
Once they walk in the door,

18:53.305 --> 18:55.106
then you try to make them
feel comfortable.

18:55.107 --> 18:57.549
But you got to get them in the door.

18:57.550 --> 18:59.551
You think I can watch you do a reading?

18:59.552 --> 19:01.513
Or would that be weird?
It's not weird.

19:01.514 --> 19:04.155
Let's just get the place
up and running first.

19:04.156 --> 19:05.997
Right.

19:05.998 --> 19:07.639
Did your mom say she was heading out?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.441
Not to me.

19:14.847 --> 19:17.328
It's Linda. Leave a message.

19:17.329 --> 19:19.130
Hey, it's me.

19:19.131 --> 19:20.476
I was wondering where you were.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.376
Nick wants, uh, pizza.

19:25.377 --> 19:28.276
I don't know if you made other plans.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.543
Anyway, call me.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.593
It's Linda. Leave a message.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.517
Hey, it's me.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.962
You forgot to shut the water off.

19:50.131 --> 19:52.003
It's fine.

19:52.004 --> 19:54.647
Just... call me.

20:00.172 --> 20:04.015
Hey, sorry to keep calling.

20:04.016 --> 20:07.539
I'm just checking to see
what time you'll be here.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.381
Don't want your dinner to get cold.

20:10.382 --> 20:12.865
Give me a ring.

20:16.869 --> 20:18.750
Oh, yeah.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.071
Food's ready.

20:20.072 --> 20:21.513
Thanks, dude.

20:21.514 --> 20:23.474
It's Linda. Lea...

20:31.564 --> 20:32.924
Plate, please.

20:32.925 --> 20:34.886
What? You don't want any pizza?

20:34.887 --> 20:36.849
Go ahead. I'll be back soon.

20:39.131 --> 20:41.093
Call me if your mom shows up.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.296
Okay.

21:21.894 --> 21:23.896
Thank you.

21:26.579 --> 21:28.741
Dad? Dad.

21:31.263 --> 21:33.866
Hey, sweetheart.

21:36.268 --> 21:37.947
What you doing here?

21:39.031 --> 21:40.408
I left him.

21:41.575 --> 21:43.034
Left who?

21:43.035 --> 21:44.537
My husband.

21:45.397 --> 21:47.639
I waited till they all left
to go to the Galleria,

21:47.640 --> 21:50.562
then I packed my stuff,
slipped out the back.

21:50.563 --> 21:53.254
I had to walk, like,
miles to get to the bus stop.

21:53.726 --> 21:55.206
You caught a bus?

21:55.207 --> 21:57.591
If I took an Uber,
they'd know where I am.

22:01.694 --> 22:02.854
Okay.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.416
Come inside.

22:09.181 --> 22:11.102
Come on in.

22:11.103 --> 22:13.304
Thanks.
Sure. Watch yourself.

22:13.305 --> 22:15.026
Step.

22:15.317 --> 22:16.548
Nice.

22:16.549 --> 22:19.150
Nice bag.

22:19.697 --> 22:21.553
Uh, take a seat.

22:21.554 --> 22:22.874
Okay.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.476
I don't know where the lights are.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.038
Uh, you want a soda?

22:27.039 --> 22:29.001
I'm good.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.584
No soda.

22:33.005 --> 22:37.969
You want... whatever the hell this is?

22:37.970 --> 22:39.450
I'm okay.

22:39.451 --> 22:42.053
No charge. I own the joint.

22:42.054 --> 22:44.976
I heard. The whole mall?

22:45.347 --> 22:46.578
Yep.

22:46.579 --> 22:49.742
The whole mall.

22:52.144 --> 22:54.345
I like your bags.

22:54.346 --> 22:56.147
Match my shirt.

22:56.148 --> 22:57.401
Oh, yeah.

23:02.072 --> 23:03.835
Do you live here, too?

23:04.700 --> 23:05.597
No.

23:05.598 --> 23:07.278
No, no, no.

23:07.279 --> 23:15.086
No, this is not
what you'd call a mixed-usage.

23:15.087 --> 23:18.611
No residential units here.

23:20.508 --> 23:22.615
Where do you live?

23:25.497 --> 23:27.378
In Encino.

23:27.379 --> 23:28.780
Yeah.

23:28.781 --> 23:30.822
A nice condo.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.423
Cool.

23:32.424 --> 23:35.708
More of a one-bedroom.

23:37.830 --> 23:40.819
More of a loft, actually.

23:51.644 --> 23:53.484
No.

23:53.485 --> 23:55.501
No, no, Daddy.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.933
You're not gonna send me back?

24:03.509 --> 24:05.818
I have to.

24:09.014 --> 24:11.983
Why... Why can't I be banished, too?

24:12.351 --> 24:15.787
What about LaLa or your grandma?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.028
But you said...

24:17.029 --> 24:19.471
I don't care what I said.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.677
I can't save you.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.606
Not yet.

24:48.345 --> 24:50.342
You have to call Grandma.

24:52.516 --> 24:54.435
I'm not allowed to.

25:03.956 --> 25:05.396
I'm sorry I have to tell you this,

25:05.397 --> 25:08.280
but I don't think
my wife likes you very much.

25:10.402 --> 25:11.643
Don't take it personally.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.579
Maybe she just hates all dolls.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.456
I don't know.

25:16.707 --> 25:21.212
Yes, I admit it, there is a lot
I don't know about my wife.

25:21.213 --> 25:24.616
Maybe that's what
makes our marriage strong.

25:24.617 --> 25:27.378
There are avenues still left to explore.

25:27.379 --> 25:31.102
Mysteries to uncover.

25:31.103 --> 25:32.784
I don't know about you,

25:32.785 --> 25:37.348
but I am sick of fucking mysteries.

25:37.349 --> 25:39.150
Okay, okay.

25:39.151 --> 25:40.672
Easy.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.153
Yeah, she doesn't have a monopoly

25:42.154 --> 25:44.716
on the mysteries in our family.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.838
I've certainly put her through
some serious mystery shit

25:46.839 --> 25:48.840
of my own lately, but I've got a plan.

25:48.841 --> 25:51.325
It's a good plan, and it is working.

25:52.493 --> 25:54.886
Why doesn't she have any faith in me?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.327
You do, right?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.338
No answer?

26:05.457 --> 26:07.339
Well, fuck you, then.

26:08.981 --> 26:11.222
You know what? I'm with her now.

26:11.887 --> 26:13.786
I'm gonna throw you back in the trash.

26:15.347 --> 26:17.429
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it, all right?

26:19.672 --> 26:21.355
I would never do that to you.

26:22.898 --> 26:24.235
At least not until I figure out

26:24.236 --> 26:26.317
what the hell you're trying to tell me.

26:26.694 --> 26:29.681
Give me a clue, a hint, a spoiler.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.085
That, uh,
that raven was a nice touch, though.

26:34.952 --> 26:36.929
Scared the shit out of me.

26:39.331 --> 26:42.013
As did you, my little friend.

26:42.668 --> 26:43.735
I tell you what.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.136
Let's make a deal.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.738
You tell me your secrets,

26:46.739 --> 26:48.660
and we'll go straight to American Girl

26:48.661 --> 26:50.823
and get you a little friend.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.923
I had to make up quite a story
to your mother-in-law.

27:11.924 --> 27:15.126
I had to tell her that you had
to go see an old friend.

27:15.127 --> 27:17.168
On this day of all days.

27:17.169 --> 27:21.052
You can imagine how suspicious she was.

27:21.053 --> 27:23.815
You have to stop this kind of behavior,
Drina.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.461
Shame on you.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.883
I'm sorry.

27:36.108 --> 27:40.151
You know, I come from a big family.

27:40.152 --> 27:43.154
My Great Grandma Lucy,
back in Lake Charles,

27:43.155 --> 27:46.037
she had 10 kids, and...
and one who passed.

27:46.565 --> 27:51.162
But after lucky number 11,
man, she was done.

27:51.612 --> 27:55.246
But, you know,
she was Creole and she was Catholic,

27:55.247 --> 27:58.169
so the church says no-no
to any kind of birth control

27:58.170 --> 27:59.691
and no to divorce, either.

27:59.692 --> 28:04.976
But hell,
no one was telling Granny Luce no.

28:04.977 --> 28:09.180
So right around the time when,
you know, her egg would drop,

28:09.838 --> 28:14.866
she'd give Grandpa a little
something extra in his balivan.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.388
That's what the Creole call
the moonshine.

28:17.389 --> 28:21.152
One minute, poor Grandpa,
he would be all in the mood.

28:21.153 --> 28:25.356
And then the next,
he was face flat on the dirt floor.

28:25.357 --> 28:27.198
Mm-hmm.

28:27.199 --> 28:31.763
And, man, Granny would keep that
up for at least three days.

28:31.764 --> 28:33.605
And then she didn't have to
worry about it again

28:33.606 --> 28:35.967
until the next month.

28:35.968 --> 28:37.849
Yep.

28:38.325 --> 28:42.134
She got out of things her way.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.176
It's just a thought.

29:56.048 --> 29:57.654
Charlie.

30:00.157 --> 30:02.894
Uh, do you know where she is?
Huh? Do you know where she is?

30:02.895 --> 30:05.078
I... No, I don't.
You don't?

30:05.898 --> 30:09.541
I have called every emergency
room within a 20-mile radius.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.342
The LAPD, they put her in the database,

30:11.343 --> 30:13.424
but this officer kindly
informed me that,

30:13.425 --> 30:16.298
even if they do find her,
they can't make her come back home.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.550
I don't know. Maybe I'll just go home,

30:18.551 --> 30:23.074
crack a few beers,
and, uh, start calling morgues.

30:23.075 --> 30:25.436
Charlie,
you have done everything that you can.

30:25.437 --> 30:27.438
Now is the time to go home
and take care of your son

30:27.439 --> 30:29.000
and... and yourself.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.242
I mean,
we're all on our own private journey.

30:31.243 --> 30:32.724
Sometimes it's with ones we love.

30:32.725 --> 30:34.726
Sometimes it's alone.

30:35.609 --> 30:38.210
Did you just quote Paz to me?

30:40.292 --> 30:41.531
Sorry.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.617
See you around, Doctor.

30:50.943 --> 30:53.304
Oh, my God, what is that smell?

30:53.305 --> 30:55.146
Rateski goi.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.508
Blood sausages.

30:56.509 --> 30:58.069
Hmm.

30:58.070 --> 31:02.433
Rita, I didn't know you, um, cooked.

31:02.678 --> 31:04.756
Only on special occasions.

31:04.757 --> 31:09.721
Well, I'm sorry,
but, um, I'm on a cleanse,

31:09.722 --> 31:12.243
and the boys and LaLa,
they're at their cousin's,

31:12.244 --> 31:15.887
so you don't have to worry about
making extra for any of us.

31:15.888 --> 31:18.089
Oh, no. But this isn't for you and me.

31:18.090 --> 31:21.012
This is for the special occasion.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.575
We Machvaia cook the rateski goi

31:23.576 --> 31:27.338
to stimulate fertility in the newlyweds.

31:27.339 --> 31:28.578
Ah.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.663
My people... don't.

31:31.664 --> 31:34.225
Are... Are you sure that's...
that's clean?

31:34.226 --> 31:36.227
My great-grandmother made it
for my grandmother,

31:36.228 --> 31:37.549
who made it for my mother,

31:37.550 --> 31:39.551
and my mother made it for me and Tibor.

31:39.552 --> 31:41.272
And look.

31:41.273 --> 31:44.395
Look at the color, symbolic of, uh...

31:44.396 --> 31:46.397
Hmm. Uh-huh. Yes.

31:46.398 --> 31:48.760
Yes, I... I get that.

31:48.761 --> 31:51.803
It's just... Tony is the pickiest eater.

31:51.804 --> 31:53.965
He's such a picky eater. I don't know.

31:53.966 --> 31:55.927
I'm sure he will do the right thing.

31:55.928 --> 31:57.609
He'll do his duty,

31:57.610 --> 32:04.056
particularly because the ritual
includes a taste of wine.

32:05.297 --> 32:07.458
Which has the added advantage

32:07.459 --> 32:10.462
of giving a young man some confidence.

32:12.384 --> 32:14.706
That's... That's good.

32:14.707 --> 32:17.109
I am gonna go tell him to get ready.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.237
Success?

32:26.238 --> 32:28.319
She has so many.

32:39.652 --> 32:41.533
Here.

32:48.581 --> 32:50.101
Ugh.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.268
Now, that wasn't so bad. Was it?

32:57.269 --> 32:59.310
It was better than I thought.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.112
Thank you. That was excellent.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.473
You're welcome.

33:02.474 --> 33:04.676
I know you don't find it so tasty,

33:04.677 --> 33:10.201
but you only have to eat it once
in your lifetime if tonight...

33:12.324 --> 33:14.643
We appreciate the effort.

33:15.047 --> 33:16.808
And now, the best part of it...

33:16.809 --> 33:19.050
A toast to the newlyweds.

33:19.051 --> 33:20.692
Tony.

33:20.693 --> 33:22.025
Drina.

33:23.255 --> 33:26.497
Here, to tradition.

33:26.498 --> 33:27.579
To family.

33:27.580 --> 33:28.660
To us.

33:28.661 --> 33:30.222
Bottoms up.

33:34.507 --> 33:36.164
Okay.

33:46.318 --> 33:47.884
Thanks.

33:49.762 --> 33:53.365
Well, it's time.

33:55.407 --> 33:57.049
Tony.

34:33.245 --> 34:34.565
For my first time,

34:34.567 --> 34:36.967
Tibor and I were so nervous.
Mm.

34:36.969 --> 34:39.489
Our family were all outside the door,
waiting.

34:39.491 --> 34:41.132
For hours.

34:41.132 --> 34:44.375
It took so long that our mothers
started to gossip.

34:44.376 --> 34:45.976
Oh.
Oh, that wasn't helpful.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.902
What about you? How was your first time?

34:50.902 --> 34:52.504
Oh.

34:52.505 --> 34:58.149
Um, well,
I guess you could say Tony was eager.

34:58.150 --> 35:03.074
Yeah, all that build-up just...
gone in sixty seconds.

35:03.075 --> 35:06.598
Done. I think...

35:06.599 --> 35:08.479
My grandmother had a similar...

35:08.480 --> 35:10.361
I think it's been long enough.

35:10.362 --> 35:11.923
Let's go.

35:27.379 --> 35:29.236
Tony?

35:34.466 --> 35:35.909
Drina?

35:38.991 --> 35:40.413
Tony?

35:48.521 --> 35:50.361
Like father, like son.

36:01.268 --> 36:03.214
One doesn't always bleed.

36:03.215 --> 36:04.696
I mean, it doesn't happen all the time.

36:04.697 --> 36:06.137
You know that.

36:06.138 --> 36:07.732
Tony.

36:09.742 --> 36:10.986
Drina?

36:11.704 --> 36:13.905
Drina?

36:19.071 --> 36:21.353
It won't come out.

36:22.635 --> 36:24.355
You don't... You don't have to do that.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.397
I tried soap, and it's not coming out.

36:27.168 --> 36:29.879
It's okay.

36:32.382 --> 36:33.883
It's okay.

36:37.449 --> 36:40.853
We really are family now.

36:42.094 --> 36:43.615
Take a shower.

36:43.616 --> 36:45.578
It'll make you feel better.

37:04.757 --> 37:06.839
Hey, uh, Dad?

37:08.280 --> 37:10.003
Hello?

37:12.204 --> 37:13.673
Dad?

37:15.207 --> 37:17.048
Dad.

37:18.811 --> 37:21.573
So, Mom didn't come home last night.

37:21.574 --> 37:24.295
I know.

37:26.138 --> 37:28.459
How am I gonna get to school?

37:29.189 --> 37:31.342
Sorry, bud. You got to take the bus.

37:31.343 --> 37:33.826
Uh, I need to head to the shop.

37:36.068 --> 37:38.069
She's pretty pissed at you, huh?

37:38.070 --> 37:39.491
No.

37:41.153 --> 37:42.233
Yeah.

37:42.234 --> 37:44.236
I don't know.

37:46.247 --> 37:49.400
Well, you guys sure do fight a lot.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.461
Not any more than most.

37:52.587 --> 37:54.526
But you still love each other, right?

37:55.632 --> 37:57.529
Yeah, we do.

37:57.530 --> 37:59.411
So that just makes everything okay?

38:02.134 --> 38:04.455
No, it's just...

38:04.456 --> 38:06.898
Relationships are difficult

38:06.899 --> 38:08.419
and people are complicated.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.861
And when you mix them together,

38:09.862 --> 38:12.524
things just get more complicated.

38:14.109 --> 38:18.349
Just like the, uh, the $500 candle?

38:19.447 --> 38:22.635
The tougher it is, the more it's worth.

38:25.745 --> 38:27.600
Maybe.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.959
You better get going.

38:32.725 --> 38:34.045
Yeah.

39:18.131 --> 39:20.772
I'm not fucking paying that.

39:21.384 --> 39:23.134
You gave me a price.

39:23.135 --> 39:25.657
I said per phone line.

39:25.658 --> 39:26.658
Not total.

39:26.659 --> 39:28.019
Yes. Fucking total.

39:28.020 --> 39:29.861
I'll be taking a bath on that deal!

39:29.862 --> 39:31.703
Charlie, just in time.

39:31.704 --> 39:34.746
Is this what it looks like?
Fuck yeah.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.669
Talking over a dozen stations,
three shifts around the clock.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.110
Calls from all over the country.

39:39.111 --> 39:41.553
Fonso tell you his last
phone bank was raided

39:41.554 --> 39:44.075
by the LAPD Task Force?

39:44.365 --> 39:46.638
The charges were dropped. We're good.

39:46.639 --> 39:48.239
No, no. We're not good.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.882
I don't want this in my shop.
What?

39:50.883 --> 39:53.164
You think your fucking card
tricks are gonna pay the rent?

39:53.165 --> 39:54.726
I'm doing you a favor.

39:54.727 --> 39:56.127
I want this shit out. Now.

39:56.128 --> 39:58.409
Hey, hey, what the fuck, man?!

39:58.410 --> 40:00.451
That's enough.

40:03.976 --> 40:05.296
What the hell was that?

40:05.970 --> 40:07.418
I don't work for him.

40:07.419 --> 40:09.060
I don't fucking work for him anymore!

40:09.061 --> 40:10.261
I know that!

40:10.262 --> 40:12.183
He knows it, too.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.425
He thought you'd be down with this.

40:14.426 --> 40:16.267
If you're not, no biggie.

40:16.268 --> 40:17.732
Here.

40:20.032 --> 40:22.754
This is about something else, isn't it?

40:29.285 --> 40:30.870
It's Linda, isn't it?

40:32.872 --> 40:34.686
She gave you shit about the new shop.

40:37.210 --> 40:38.730
Am I right?

40:38.731 --> 40:40.852
Don't worry bout that, Charlie.

40:40.853 --> 40:43.214
She'll be fine. This is just business.

40:43.215 --> 40:44.717
It's not fine.

40:45.618 --> 40:47.387
She's gone.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.305
She's gone.

40:50.983 --> 40:52.904
Here's the thing.

40:53.434 --> 40:55.667
Did she tell you she was leaving you?

40:56.813 --> 40:58.940
No. All right, take it from me.

40:59.992 --> 41:03.595
When a wife dumps you,
she wants to tell you.

41:05.071 --> 41:08.439
She wants to enjoy seeing you squirm.

41:09.409 --> 41:11.643
My first couldn't wait
to tell me to fuck off.

41:11.644 --> 41:14.831
Or in my case, "Vete pa' la chingada."

41:16.332 --> 41:20.011
Men, we're stupid, right?

41:20.920 --> 41:23.776
Women need to spell it out for us.

41:25.698 --> 41:28.660
We'll find another spot
for Fonso's phone shit.

41:29.012 --> 41:30.597
I'll talk to him.

41:31.063 --> 41:34.186
I'll also make sure he's not
in there planning your murder.

41:36.108 --> 41:37.312
Charlie.

41:38.711 --> 41:40.231
Good luck, man.

42:26.438 --> 42:30.882
None of the matter and energy
that we are made of

42:30.883 --> 42:32.700
is original to us.

42:33.409 --> 42:35.495
It is as old as the universe.

42:37.121 --> 42:40.131
In fact, we are made up of particles

42:40.132 --> 42:42.894
that may have existed in a stegosaurus

42:42.895 --> 42:47.298
or a shogun's sword or Queen Victoria.

42:49.717 --> 42:54.305
Even our consciousness
is part of something else.

42:55.473 --> 42:58.229
So, when we die,

42:58.230 --> 43:02.438
pieces of us become
part of the universe,

43:03.115 --> 43:08.320
and then those all
share a message with us.

43:09.987 --> 43:14.045
So just as water does not

43:14.046 --> 43:17.729
fight the concept of evaporation,

43:17.730 --> 43:21.773
neither should we fight
the concept of death.

43:21.774 --> 43:24.055
You're not afraid of dying.

43:24.056 --> 43:28.299
You're afraid of not living enough.

43:28.756 --> 43:30.822
Fight that.

43:30.823 --> 43:34.946
That is what the universe
is trying to tell you.

43:35.805 --> 43:37.515
Are you listening?

43:39.434 --> 43:41.754
I am listening.

44:09.672 --> 44:16.828
I sense a seeker who
has something to share

44:16.829 --> 44:20.272
but was not ready to share last night.

44:24.156 --> 44:26.157
You're talking about Nora, right?

44:26.158 --> 44:28.359
I'm pretty sure it's your turn.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.281
I won't force you to share.

44:30.282 --> 44:31.723
Good.

44:32.653 --> 44:36.247
But then, if you don't want to share,

44:36.248 --> 44:41.292
I have to ask why are you here?

44:41.293 --> 44:42.694
I'm not really sure.

44:42.695 --> 44:44.536
Well, what if you were sure?

44:44.537 --> 44:46.292
Then what would you say?

44:47.499 --> 44:49.941
Maybe I'm looking for something.

44:49.942 --> 44:52.303
As we all are.

44:52.304 --> 44:54.025
What something?

44:54.026 --> 44:56.427
Is it something you lost?

44:57.510 --> 44:59.722
Something to make me feel better.

45:00.312 --> 45:02.674
Like a cigarette would right now.

45:02.675 --> 45:04.195
If your staff hadn't taken them.

45:05.317 --> 45:07.919
Smoking would quiet a voice,

45:07.920 --> 45:11.203
but it wouldn't make you feel better.

45:12.404 --> 45:14.205
Look, trust me.

45:14.946 --> 45:16.697
Let's try something.

45:18.410 --> 45:20.284
Don't quiet that voice.

45:22.036 --> 45:23.855
Close your eyes.

45:24.503 --> 45:25.915
Listen to it.

45:29.822 --> 45:32.624
Are you listening?

45:38.711 --> 45:40.513
I am listening.
