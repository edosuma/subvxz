00:00.250 --> 00:02.110
Last season on Criminal Minds.

00:02.120 --> 00:04.770
I believe you are no longer
effective in your post.

00:04.780 --> 00:08.310
I am questioning your
ability to lead your team.

00:09.700 --> 00:10.860
Sarah. Sarah,I'm so late.

00:10.870 --> 00:12.430
I got caught up at the office.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.180
He butchered her,hotch.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.200
He came after me. 
He came in my home.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.070
It's my fault.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.970
It's time for Agent Hotchner's
career to come to an end.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.370
Agent Prentiss,you're going
to help me make that happen.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.330
I knew it would be you who came
to the cabin to check on me.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.440
You must be frightened.
I apologize for that.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.540
I never meant to cause you any pain.

00:42.530 --> 00:45.250
And I also never envisioned
writing this letter.

00:46.810 --> 00:50.300
I've searched for a satisfactory
explanation for what I'm doing.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.760
All I've come up with is.

00:53.770 --> 00:57.310
a profiler needs to have solid footing.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.200
I--I don't think
I do anymore.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.740
The world confuses me.

01:03.030 --> 01:06.090
The cruelty,the indifference.

01:06.430 --> 01:08.090
the tragedy.

01:08.780 --> 01:12.880
When my dear friend sarah was
murdered,it tore a hole in me.

01:12.890 --> 01:18.500
And I truly believe the way I handled the pain
was to get back to our work as quickly as possible.

01:19.070 --> 01:23.870
Get on to helping somebody else
until I could handle sarah's murder.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.830
Work through it.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.540
Remember the first case we had after?

01:28.550 --> 01:30.750
It was on a college campus.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.380
FLAGSTAFF,ARIZONA

01:34.530 --> 01:35.420
Jim griffith.

01:35.430 --> 01:37.260
Hi.Jennifer jareau.
Thanks for meeting us here.

01:37.270 --> 01:39.090
- Thanks for taking us on so quickly.
- Yeah.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.460
The faster we get here,the faster
we can help stave off panic.

01:41.470 --> 01:42.260
I hear that.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.240
What can you tell us
about the university?

01:44.250 --> 01:47.270
It's small,tight-knit.
Dorms are still single-sex.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.900
Draws from all over the county,but
students are mostly the arty type.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.560
Have you increased
uniform presence on campus?

01:51.570 --> 01:52.490
Yeah. Doubled it.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.390
Any other measures?

01:53.400 --> 01:57.710
I got security shuttles running 24/7,and
as of tonight,I've imposed a 10:00 curfew.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.270
We need a corner of your
precinct so we can set up shop.

02:00.280 --> 02:00.980
You got it.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.790
- You need to get to the hotel first?
- No.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.610
Spree killings in a
confined area are a race.

02:04.620 --> 02:05.970
He's racing to kill as many as he can.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.780
We're racing to stop him.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074

02:19.410 --> 02:20.690
hey,wait!

02:25.320 --> 02:26.320
damn.

02:43.090 --> 02:46.420
Ok,so talk to everyone on the floor
and we'll hang out in my room tonight.

02:46.430 --> 02:48.270
I'm gonna study for russian lit.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.690
There's a maniac trying to
kill us all. Don't worry.

02:50.700 --> 02:51.840
They'll grade on a curve.

02:51.850 --> 02:53.470
It helps me feel normal.

02:55.190 --> 02:57.630
Ok,just be nice to her. Please.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.400
She's making it worse.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.460
She's scared.

03:00.470 --> 03:03.390
And using it as an excuse to
get into everybody's business.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.660
Kate.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.510
Ok,fine. You win.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.550
Where have you been?

03:14.560 --> 03:15.540
Uh,the library.

03:15.550 --> 03:17.740
Curfew's in 5 minutes.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.610
That's why we're here.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.180
I don't want anyone
drinking on the hall.

03:22.190 --> 03:24.650
If you do,I'll write you up.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.880
You see,I met sarah at college,on a
campus just like that one,31 years ago.

03:36.630 --> 03:39.840
Campuses are supposed to be
places of life and excitement.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.770
They're supposed to be about the future,

03:41.780 --> 03:44.270
figuring out who you are
and who you're gonna be.

03:45.550 --> 03:48.860
They're supposed to be
about dreams,not nightmares.

03:50.270 --> 03:51.760
They're supposed to be about hope.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.730
I just apparently don't
understand the world anymore.

04:28.130 --> 04:31.720
All homicide scenes are tragic,but
when the victim is someone young,

04:31.730 --> 04:36.040
their life ripped away before
they've even had a chance to live.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.540
I've got men at every
exit point on campus.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.970
She had her mace out,but
she didn't use it?

04:41.980 --> 04:43.290
And it's well lit.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.220
He's not afraid of being seen.

04:45.230 --> 04:46.360
How often do the shuttles run?

04:46.370 --> 04:47.200
Every 10 minutes.

04:47.210 --> 04:49.710
Were all the other victims posed
like this,with their arms crossed?

04:49.720 --> 04:50.530
Yeah. Why?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.560
It's a classic sign of remorse.

04:52.570 --> 04:55.300
The unsub kills the victim,then
immediately feels bad about it,

04:55.310 --> 04:57.450
so he poses them like this
so they'll rest in peace.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.790
You can tell that just by the arms?

04:58.800 --> 05:02.170
That's why you called us here,to build
a psychological profile of your killer.

05:02.180 --> 05:03.910
How long will it take your
men to clear the scene?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.310
A few hours.

05:05.980 --> 05:08.440
Lucky there's a curfew,otherwise
there'd be a mob scene.

05:08.450 --> 05:11.680
Have hotch set up at the precinct.
We'll run everything through him.

05:13.140 --> 05:16.840
By the time this campus wakes
up,I want a handle on this.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.660
What the hell?

05:46.600 --> 05:50.340
Dean suzanne cable,special
agents morgan and gideon.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.590
Thank you for being here.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.960
Wish we didn't have to be.

05:52.970 --> 05:55.320
I spoke to amy's parents.

05:55.330 --> 05:58.890
Funeral services will be
held on sunday in chicago.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.930
They're arriving later
today to bring her home.

06:01.940 --> 06:06.720
They asked me to let you know that they will
be staying downtown at the mainline hotel.

06:06.730 --> 06:10.880
If any of you would like to visit or pay your
respects,they'd like you to feel free to do so.

06:10.890 --> 06:13.400
How did you all let this happen?

06:14.160 --> 06:15.230
What?

06:15.240 --> 06:16.480
Everybody is thinking it.

06:16.490 --> 06:19.260
You are the fbi,the campus
is crawling with police,

06:19.270 --> 06:21.590
and she gets murdered waiting
for the security shuttle.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.680
That's not helpful,katie.

06:22.690 --> 06:23.600
Actually,it is.

06:23.610 --> 06:27.860
The fact that your friend was killed in such a
well-lit area with a police presence indicates

06:27.870 --> 06:29.750
that the killer is most
likely part of this campus.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.090
He's not an outsider.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.130
He's someone who wouldn't raise alarm
with the police or potential victims.

06:34.140 --> 06:37.890
You should also be aware that
the 3 victims were brunette.

06:37.900 --> 06:41.730
- What?
- At this point,we do consider it an intentional pattern.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.190
So tell me,how am i supposed
to keep these women safe?

06:46.200 --> 06:49.490
I have security cameras being installed
in virtually every corner of the campus,

06:49.500 --> 06:50.740
and that's coming out
of the city's budget.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.290
It's not the school'S.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.350
I want to shut down the school.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.700
- That's a viable choice.
- But?

06:56.710 --> 07:00.250
If the killer is part of the campus,he may
simply leave once the school shuts down.

07:00.260 --> 07:03.900
When classes restart,there's
a good chance he'll kill again.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.270
What would you do in my place?

07:07.820 --> 07:09.870
I can't say.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.730
Shut it down.

07:12.740 --> 07:17.330
I can't justify keeping these kids locked
up in a pen while someone hunts them.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.900
In this line of work,I was afraid
I would lose the ability to trust.

07:21.910 --> 07:25.480
But I realized I can't really look
at anyone without seeing their death.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.370
And as bad as losing
faith in humanity seems,

07:29.380 --> 07:31.970
losing your faith in happy
endings is much worse.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.160
Did the other victims
have this much overkill?

07:34.170 --> 07:37.300
Death was caused by a single,very
forceful stab wound to the heart.

07:37.310 --> 07:39.460
Yeah. He broke through the breastbone.

07:39.470 --> 07:41.360
And after that,he just
lashed out at random.

07:41.370 --> 07:43.270
Well,no defensive wounds.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.740
She didn't even hold her
hands up to fight him off.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.600
The first 2 victims were the same.

07:47.610 --> 07:49.400
Did you run toxicology screens?

07:49.410 --> 07:50.690
None of the others were drugged.

07:50.700 --> 07:55.540
Considering that she was standing waiting
for a shuttle,my guess is she wasn't either.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.240
I'm sorry about before.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.420
I'm sorry about your friend.

08:03.430 --> 08:06.230
Uh,your R.A.Told us that you guys
were at the library last night.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.070
Did you see amy there?

08:08.080 --> 08:10.060
We didn't go with
her,but we saw her there.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.830
I thought she left before us.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.960
Her bag wasn't in her cubicle,or
else we would have waited.

08:14.970 --> 08:18.820
Did you notice anyone she might
have been talking to earlier?

08:19.250 --> 08:22.890
Was it like her to be walking alone,even
in a dangerous situation like this?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.990
She wasn't the victim type.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.520
It's almost impossible to
pinpoint who's the most vulnerable.

08:27.530 --> 08:30.520
That's why we're trying to teach
you how to best protect yourselves.

08:30.530 --> 08:33.789
I just mean that she was
strong,and she was smart.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.250
I don't know why she
didn't at least mace him.

08:36.260 --> 08:38.549
Are a lot of girls carrying mace?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.710
Pepper spray,mace,switchblades.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.480
If you can buy it online or find it at
the army-navy store,we've all bought it.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.400
Are you sure about who he's killing?

08:46.410 --> 08:48.250
I mean,brunettes?

08:48.260 --> 08:50.240
Pretty sure. Yeah.

09:03.550 --> 09:04.180
Prentiss.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.380
Good morning,emily.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.440
Agent prentiss?

09:08.730 --> 09:09.600
I'm here.

09:09.610 --> 09:11.520
I'm just checking in.

09:12.140 --> 09:13.170
Checking in?

09:13.180 --> 09:15.440
On your case. The college girls.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.980
Uh,we don't know that much yet,ma'am.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.740
But you will let me know if there's
anything to report,won't you?

09:20.750 --> 09:22.600
I really have to get back to work.

09:22.610 --> 09:25.700
Of course. You know
where you can reach me.

09:33.730 --> 09:36.780
Realistically,it'll take 2
or 3 days to empty campus.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.950
I'm afraid that'll be our
window for catching this guy.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.310
What do you need from me?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.820
You said you're installing
security cameras?

09:41.830 --> 09:42.770
Yeah,this afternoon.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.070
Can they be functional by nightfall?

09:44.080 --> 09:44.830
I'll make sure.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.680
We'll need as many
men as you can on duty.

09:46.690 --> 09:50.900
If the unsub's part of campus life,he's
gonna know it's about to shut down.

09:50.910 --> 09:53.710
Next few days,that's
his last chance to hunt.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.280
Uniform presence helps,
but it'd also be good to have some
of your younger officers go in 
plainclothes,try to blend in.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.660
I can ask my men to work double
shifts till we're evacuated.

10:00.670 --> 10:02.510
I'll call campus security
and have them do the same.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.180
Good.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.310
Good morning.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.490
How many victims have we seen?

10:23.500 --> 10:24.730
How many crime scenes?

10:24.740 --> 10:27.310
Hundreds? A thousand?

10:27.640 --> 10:32.270
Pictures,families,victims,both
alive and dead.

10:33.220 --> 10:37.200
I was always able to stay
objective,to stay at arm's length.

10:37.210 --> 10:41.970
Now all I see is sarah in them.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.770
Have many days will it take
to evacuate the students?

10:44.780 --> 10:46.710
2,3 days,tops.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.380
You think it's premature?

10:48.390 --> 10:50.490
Do we have a choice?

10:50.730 --> 10:52.580
Detective,can you gather your men?

10:52.590 --> 10:55.570
- We'd like to present a rough profile.
- Got it

10:57.460 --> 10:59.850
All right,grab a seat.
Let's go.Anywhere.

11:00.210 --> 11:02.050
We know everyone's
tired,working overtime.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.390
We want to tell you how
much we appreciate it.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.440
We'd like to give you a rough profile
of the man we're all looking for.

11:06.450 --> 11:07.970
This is someone with access.

11:07.980 --> 11:13.110
He's managed to move in a small community with
a high police presence without raising suspicion.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.750
Which means there's a good chance
that this is someone you've seen.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.940
This unsub has killed 3 women in 4 days.

11:17.950 --> 11:19.470
That's what we call a spree killer.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.850
Now,most likely,something has happened
in the past few days to set him off.

11:22.860 --> 11:24.780
Because he kills white,brunette women,.

11:24.790 --> 11:29.000
that stressor probably has to do with a woman
in his life who fits the same description--

11:29.010 --> 11:31.110
wife,mother,girlfriend

11:31.120 --> 11:33.890
Women he's killing,they're
most likely a substitute.

11:33.900 --> 11:37.550
What we need you to do is look at
people who are part of the campus fabric.

11:37.560 --> 11:41.370
See if anyone fits the bill--
students,professors,support staff.

11:41.380 --> 11:44.480
I'm sorry,but how are my men supposed
to know about somebody's home life?

11:44.490 --> 11:46.850
Well,the people around him
have seen him devolving.

11:46.860 --> 11:49.630
If you suspect someone on
campus,talk to anyone who knows him,

11:49.640 --> 11:53.110
find out if he's recently
found religion,been drinking,

11:53.120 --> 11:54.830
even if he's been harming himself.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.020
He may feel emasculated.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.830
Considering the stressor
and the victimology,

11:58.840 --> 12:01.450
there's a good chance that rejection
is a recurring theme in his life.

12:01.460 --> 12:04.270
This unsub displays a
great amount of anger,

12:04.280 --> 12:07.370
stabs his victims repeatedly,even
after they're dead.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.950
Seconds later,he feels remorse.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.420
It's possible that his guilt is because
his victims were in a position to trust him.

12:14.430 --> 12:15.350
How's that?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.850
As we said,we think he's
a part of campus life.

12:17.860 --> 12:20.120
The victims,they feel safe around him.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.470
He's able to get close.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.710
He's also able to kill these
women without them fighting back.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.860
Not one of them has defensive
wounds on their hands.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.760
Like if they'd been tasered first.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.530
That's possible. Why?

12:30.540 --> 12:33.180
Security guards on campus
aren't allowed guns.

12:33.190 --> 12:35.130
They carry tasers.

12:35.570 --> 12:38.400
Can you get me an employment
list fouscampr security?

12:42.590 --> 12:43.750
What is it?

12:43.760 --> 12:46.430
These markings could have
easily come from a taser.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.940
Employment list,campus security.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.680
How we gonna narrow this down?

12:50.690 --> 12:52.960
This unsub chose a closed
community on purpose.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.280
He'd want to inject himself
into the investigation.

12:55.290 --> 12:58.920
Can you check the records,find out if any of these
security guards responded to every crime scene?

12:58.930 --> 12:59.850
You got it.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.220
In the meantime,call garcia. Have her
check the list against criminal records.

13:05.310 --> 13:06.280
Talk to me,girlfriend.

13:06.290 --> 13:08.710
I need to give you a
list of security guards.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.740
I got nothing.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.280
- Nothing?
- Nada.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.240
Security guards are all clean,squeaky.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.260
No criminal records.

13:48.270 --> 13:50.910
What about a recent rejection?

13:50.920 --> 13:52.240
Something set him off.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.910
Any of these guys get fired
recently,or did their wife leave?

13:55.920 --> 13:56.670
I'm sorry,em.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.220
Thats ifar too general,even
for my powers of snooping.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.680
Ok. Ok.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.240
you're a security guard.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.550
I'm not sure I like where this is going.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.920
- You probably had higher ambitions.
- Easy.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.850
Could you cross-check these guys
against police and military records?

14:11.860 --> 14:15.660
See if any of them got
kicked out or rejected.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.060
I got one,but it's not recent.

14:19.070 --> 14:20.210
Give it to me anyway.

14:20.220 --> 14:23.390
Nathan tubbs,rejected from
the police academy,2003.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.290
Failed his psych eval.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.640
I got a list of responders.

14:26.650 --> 14:29.280
Only 4 guards were at every scene.

14:32.210 --> 14:33.920
Nathan tubbs.

14:33.930 --> 14:36.800
Garcia,what else can
you give me on tubbs?

14:38.700 --> 14:40.930
I got a court appearance 6 days ago.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.610
Looks like the judge gave his wife
full custody of their daughter.

14:43.620 --> 14:44.590
No visitation rights.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.900
How much you want to bet
his ex-wife is a brunette?

14:46.910 --> 14:49.190
- You are the best.
- Word.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.640
We've got a possible.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.220
Clear!

15:00.260 --> 15:02.150
Bathroom's clear!

15:10.960 --> 15:12.000
Gideon.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.460
I've got his work schedule here.

15:20.470 --> 15:21.600
He's not on duty.

15:21.610 --> 15:23.050
Where is he?

15:42.160 --> 15:43.960
You shouldn't be walking alone.

15:43.970 --> 15:46.020
My car's just 2 blocks
ahead in the parking lot.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.100
Well,I'll drive you.

15:47.110 --> 15:47.980
It's ok.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.650
No,it's not.

15:50.140 --> 15:52.550
It's my job to keep you safe.

15:53.170 --> 15:54.470
Hop in.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.580
- Ok.
- No,no,no.Front.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.210
you like music?

16:17.330 --> 16:19.600
Not sure what you're all into.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.210
This is good.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.460
I have a daughter,but
she's younger than you.

16:28.390 --> 16:30.040
She's pretty.

16:30.930 --> 16:33.320
Judge says I can't see her.

16:34.550 --> 16:36.340
I'm sorry.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.290
You wouldn't do that,would you?

16:41.300 --> 16:42.380
What?

16:42.390 --> 16:45.720
Make a baby with somebody
and then take her away.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.320
No. No.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.230
You swear?

16:52.740 --> 16:53.490
What?

16:53.500 --> 16:54.900
Swear to me.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.480
I swear.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.670
you're not a liar,are you?

17:05.079 --> 17:06.430
No.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.619
My ex-wife is a liar.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.790
Um,this is my parking lot.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.869
I'll drive you to your car.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.319
It's ok.

17:14.329 --> 17:16.630
No,the entrance is
right around the block.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.690
- Please.
- Don't argue with me!

17:33.120 --> 17:34.390
Nathan tubbs!

17:34.400 --> 17:35.720
Hands where I can see 'em!

17:35.730 --> 17:37.340
Hands where I can see them!

17:38.150 --> 17:39.640
- Get out of the car.
- What's going on?

17:39.650 --> 17:41.860
- Get out of the car.
- What is this about?

17:41.870 --> 17:43.400
Get out of the car.

17:43.690 --> 17:44.840
- I didn't-
- get down!

17:44.850 --> 17:46.560
Get down! Get down!

17:47.750 --> 17:49.590
You ok?Did he hurt you?

17:49.600 --> 17:51.260
- No.
- Ok.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.240
It's ok.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.380
Ok.It's ok.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.280
Don't move.

18:00.990 --> 18:02.550
Don't move.

18:03.090 --> 18:05.360
I was protecting her.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.580
What's this?

18:10.590 --> 18:11.880
This is over.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.520
Nathan tubbs--
he was easy.

18:14.530 --> 18:18.790
There was a time in my career when I would
have asked the question I should have asked.

18:20.680 --> 18:24.050
The worst trap for a profiler
to fall into is pride,

18:24.060 --> 18:27.600
forgetting that for all your
skills,profiling is just.

18:27.610 --> 18:28.610
a tool.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.460
Am I under arrest?

18:30.470 --> 18:32.180
I just want to visit for a while.

18:32.810 --> 18:35.150
I didn't murder anyone.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.330
You weren't supposed
to be working tonight.

18:37.340 --> 18:39.700
They asked us to pick up extra shifts.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.400
There's a killer out there.

18:41.410 --> 18:42.750
Oh,I know.

18:43.270 --> 18:44.880
You were at every crime scene.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.850
It's my job.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.630
You seem to be doing it better
than any of your coworkers.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.820
People should be thanking me.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.650
Thank you.

18:58.660 --> 19:02.880
You think just because I'm a security
guard,I don't understand sarcasm?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.400
Are you angry?

19:10.410 --> 19:13.580
I--I know how
interrogation works.

19:13.590 --> 19:16.970
Do you lose your temper easily?

19:16.980 --> 19:19.600
Is this fun for you?

19:20.370 --> 19:22.250
No.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.170
How's it going out there?

19:29.180 --> 19:30.540
Gideon's winding him up.

19:30.550 --> 19:31.440
Smart.

19:31.450 --> 19:33.970
Yone who exhibits that much
overkill is bound to explode.

19:33.980 --> 19:35.510
How goes it in here?

19:35.520 --> 19:41.310
Means of subduing the victim,potential
weapon,source of displaced rage,

19:41.320 --> 19:45.220
stressor,evidence of a
self-destructive spiral,

19:45.230 --> 19:48.930
and trophies of his kills.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.600
Everything that points to the
profile,yet nothing we could hold him on.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.310
That looks like it hurts.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.320
I've been under a lot of stress.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.020
The murders?

20:00.660 --> 20:02.050
Your job?

20:02.590 --> 20:04.480
A lot of things.

20:04.490 --> 20:06.850
You keep clips of the
murders on your wall.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.720
Rkm woi'in' on the case.

20:19.570 --> 20:21.070
You had a knife on you.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.510
We're not allowed guns.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.000
Are you allowed knives?

20:32.810 --> 20:35.280
She's pretty,isn't she?

20:36.610 --> 20:39.910
The girl you picked up
tonight was a brunette.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.950
Oh,was she?

20:43.260 --> 20:45.950
Telling me you didn't notice?

20:47.020 --> 20:48.930
Do you like brunettes?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.690
Used to.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.390
Not anymore.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.040
Not so much.

20:58.070 --> 21:00.310
You know,I wouldn't mind
some actual physical evidence.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.330
Do we have anything?

21:01.340 --> 21:03.330
The knife tubbs had
on him is inconclusive.

21:03.340 --> 21:04.720
The taser didn't have any prints on it,

21:04.730 --> 21:06.990
which I guarantee means we're
not gonna get a dna match either.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.330
I'll stop by the security offices.

21:08.340 --> 21:12.150
If tubbs kept any trophies linking himself to
the crimes,he might have kept 'em in his locker.

21:12.160 --> 21:12.900
I'll go with you.

21:12.910 --> 21:14.230
No,let reid do it.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.260
Go to the hotel. Check in.

21:15.270 --> 21:16.890
They're not gonna
hold our rooms forever.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.900
We'll go in shifts.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.520
I'll sleep when he confesses.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.180
We all will.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.100
Why don't you charge me?

21:33.110 --> 21:34.090
Are you guilty?

21:34.100 --> 21:36.540
Well,you seem to have already
made up your mind that I am.

21:36.550 --> 21:39.230
I told you you and i are just visiting.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.450
Right.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.280
Do you really want to know what I think?

21:44.290 --> 21:49.320
I think you chew your cuticles to punish
yourself over what your hands have been doing.

21:49.330 --> 21:50.660
I think you hate your ex-wife.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.660
I think you want to kill her.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.920
But you can't because she's the mother
of your daughter,so you find girls

21:56.930 --> 21:59.470
who remind you of her
and you kill them instead.

21:59.480 --> 22:03.550
You stab them over and
over,'cause they deserve it.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.850
If not now,they will sooner or later.

22:08.860 --> 22:12.590
You're just saving someone
else the nightmare later on.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.280
And then.

22:14.290 --> 22:16.110
you remember your daughter,

22:16.120 --> 22:18.960
how you're actually supposed
to be looking after these girls.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.170
So you feel bad,and you.

22:21.900 --> 22:27.150
cross their arms over their chests,try
to give 'em back some of their dignity.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.270
My job is protecting these girls.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.800
Like you can't protect your daughter.

22:33.260 --> 22:34.860
I am a good father.

22:34.870 --> 22:37.400
Why won't the judge let you see her?

22:37.410 --> 22:39.660
I'm not gonna talk about that.

22:41.730 --> 22:45.560
Why did you fail your police
psychological evaluation?

22:46.040 --> 22:48.300
I want a lawyer.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.800
Bag these,get 'em to a lab.

23:30.970 --> 23:33.740
Jim,do you mind giving me a
reason you're holding my client?

23:33.750 --> 23:35.920
We were looking for someone
who was part of the campus,

23:35.930 --> 23:39.020
who had motive and opportunity and
injected himself into the investigation.

23:39.030 --> 23:40.310
So you had a hunch.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.610
We have a comprehensive
psychological profile.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.200
Your client fits exactly.

23:44.210 --> 23:46.080
You did tell him we
deal in facts here,right?

23:46.090 --> 23:47.320
Don't be a jackass,paul.

23:47.330 --> 23:49.110
I invited him here.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.470
My client was working
during each of the murders.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.510
He was present at every scene.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.480
Because it's his job.

23:55.490 --> 23:58.430
There's not one witness placing him
anywhere near one of the murders.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.490
There's not a shred
of physical evidence.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.640
Your client was apprehended
with a young woman.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.750
She fits the description
of each of the victims.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.830
Could you imagine the
uproar on this campus

24:06.840 --> 24:11.750
if a brunette woman was killed and people found
out a security guard let her walk to her car alone?

24:12.730 --> 24:13.990
Excuse me.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.370
Did you get tubbs' psych eval?

24:24.380 --> 24:25.180
Yep.

24:25.190 --> 24:30.080
Police shrink diagnosed him borderline
with antisocial and sociopathic tendencies.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.190
He's gonna be all over me.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.430
I need to make a decision.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.550
You can hold him for 72
hours without charging him.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.550
What do you think,gideon?

24:44.560 --> 24:48.360
I think only a guilty man can
lay his head down and sleep

24:48.840 --> 24:51.800
when he's facing 3 murder charges.

24:51.810 --> 24:54.070
It's physically
exhausting--

24:54.080 --> 24:58.420
the killing,the
secrets,evading the police.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.380
It's almost a relief when you
don't have to hide anymore.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.750
Tell me you're doing the right thing.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.530
We're holding him for 72 hours.

25:23.380 --> 25:26.450
Everyone is so much younger
than I remember being.

25:26.810 --> 25:28.310
It's a weird age.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.860
You want to be treated like an adult,but you're still
used to someone else solving your problems for you.

25:31.870 --> 25:34.860
All I remember is trying
to figure out who I was.

25:34.870 --> 25:38.420
You move around enough,you get used
to being whoever people want you to be.

25:38.430 --> 25:39.960
Hey,J.J.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.920
Hey,there's a rumor going
around that you caught the guy.

25:44.930 --> 25:46.690
Is it--is
it true?

25:46.700 --> 25:48.920
We have someone in custody.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.790
Thank you.

25:54.150 --> 25:57.870
It was like you could physically
feel the mood change on the campus.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.140
Kids--they're
so resilient.

26:01.150 --> 26:04.980
They trust and believe in a way I
remember but can't reach anymore.

26:05.350 --> 26:07.490
Like a very old picture.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.740
If she was a cartoon character,she'd
have steam blowing out of her ears.

26:11.750 --> 26:15.160
She is a cartoon character.

26:15.170 --> 26:19.020
You remember the circumstances
with the feelings,the emotions.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.630
They're just out of your grasp.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.040
All right. See ya.

26:23.050 --> 26:24.180
No. No.

26:24.190 --> 26:26.000
Well,I can't study here.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.480
- That's the point.
- Ok.

26:27.490 --> 26:29.160
I'm going to the cafe. It's open late.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.620
Technically you still have a curfew.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.820
Yeah,well,technically I don't care.

26:33.230 --> 26:35.010
Go crazy,girl.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.680
They believed in us. Believed in me.

26:41.690 --> 26:43.990
The way sarah believed in me.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.790
And,as with sarah,I feel that I
led them right to the slaughter.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.930
was I even doing there?

27:21.940 --> 27:27.130
How many times have I told you that a profiler
cannot do the job if the mind is unfocused?

27:27.820 --> 27:32.110
If anything is going on in your personal
life that would cloud your judgment.

27:32.120 --> 27:36.060
my mind has never been more
unfocused than it was on that campus.

27:36.070 --> 27:38.370
Griffith,we gotta get this barrier
pushed back. We're gettin' pressed.

27:38.380 --> 27:40.590
Joe,give me 10 more
feet on the tape,huh?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.220
I thought you had someone in custody.

27:42.230 --> 27:43.160
We do.

27:43.170 --> 27:45.030
- Ma'am,can you help me with the students?
- How?

27:45.040 --> 27:48.820
Tell them we understand that they're
upset,but we need room to do our job.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.060
Yeah.

27:54.670 --> 27:56.740
I guess we can release tubbs after all.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.450
Well,I think that'd be a mistake.

27:58.460 --> 27:59.580
What are you talkin' about?

27:59.590 --> 28:00.900
I don't think it was the same killer.

28:00.910 --> 28:01.930
You gotta be kidding me.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.700
She has blunt-force trauma to the head.

28:03.710 --> 28:05.680
She was knocked out,not tasered.

28:05.690 --> 28:07.770
She's a brunette,stabbed
to death on this campus.

28:07.780 --> 28:11.010
These stab wounds are shallow.
They're hesitation marks.

28:11.020 --> 28:14.230
Whoever killed her either wasn't sure they wanted
to be killing,or they never tried it before.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.510
There are no defensive wounds,just
like every other victim.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.610
- That's not surprising,
considering the head wound.
- Excuse me.

28:19.620 --> 28:22.110
Sir,uh,this was dropped at the precinct.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.990
There were no prints on it.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.730
"He's innocent. I'm still out here.

28:26.740 --> 28:28.310
" Now do you believe
we have the wrong guy?

28:28.320 --> 28:29.530
The first unsub showed remorse.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.050
He wouldn't brag about
or flaunt his latest kill.

28:32.060 --> 28:32.950
I don't believe this.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.680
This victim wasn't posed.

28:34.690 --> 28:37.720
The papers never included
details abt outhe bodies.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.120
If this was a copycat,he could only do it
the way he assumed the first killer did.

28:42.130 --> 28:45.630
Look,I asked you guys here
because I needed your help.

28:45.640 --> 28:49.210
You're the experts,but right now,it sounds to
me like you're trying to cover your own asses.

28:49.220 --> 28:52.450
Hey,look around. This is not
the place for this conversation.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.240
I am so sorry.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.530
You said you caught him.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.980
I--I said we had
someone in custody.

29:13.990 --> 29:16.500
Alisa's dead and you're
arguing over wording?

29:16.510 --> 29:20.180
No. I--I'm
so sorry.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.690
You need to keep people out of here,man.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.690
What? I'm fine.It's nothing.

29:31.590 --> 29:33.110
Just wait here for a second.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.520
Tubbs' lawyer's been here for the
last hour demanding we release him.

29:36.530 --> 29:37.290
What's happened out there?

29:37.300 --> 29:38.720
I think we got a copycat.

29:38.730 --> 29:40.880
Do you want to tell me why the
hell my client hasn't been released?

29:40.890 --> 29:42.060
Cut me some slack here,paul.

29:42.070 --> 29:44.320
You've got another murder and
a note from the real killer.

29:44.330 --> 29:45.190
We're discussing that.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.770
I'm not saying he's not a creep.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.350
I'm just saying he didn't do this.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.290
Just take a seat,please. Ok?

29:50.300 --> 29:51.950
Come on.Give us a second.

29:54.230 --> 29:56.170
- Everybody still in the conference room?
- Yeah

29:56.480 --> 29:57.770
How long can you hold that lawyer off?

29:57.780 --> 29:58.990
You kidding? I was a prosecutor.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.850
I can hold him off for days.

30:02.850 --> 30:04.890
So you think we're makin' a mistake,huh?

30:04.900 --> 30:05.970
I know we're tired.

30:05.980 --> 30:08.910
There's a lot of pressure. We all
want to believe that profile is right.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.510
I believe it is.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.650
What if we're wrong,gideon?

30:12.660 --> 30:14.200
Tubbs enticed that
girl to get in his car.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.960
There's nothing to suggest that
the unsub has ever done that before.

30:16.970 --> 30:19.620
There's also nothing
to suggest he hasn't.

30:19.630 --> 30:22.380
I know how bad cops want to
believe they got the right guy.

30:22.390 --> 30:23.630
I've been on both sides of that.

30:23.640 --> 30:28.730
- This last kill had a different signature.
- I know

30:28.740 --> 30:32.160
I also know that richard jewell fit the
profile of the olympic bomber to a "t,"

30:32.170 --> 30:34.230
and he was innocent,

30:34.240 --> 30:37.400
but the accusations tore apart his life.

30:39.880 --> 30:43.420
I can't believe we're actually
thinking about letting tubbs go.

30:43.730 --> 30:45.960
J.J.,We got no evidence.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.960
Tubbs' lawyer's not gonna let him talk,so
we're not about to get a confession out of him.

30:48.970 --> 30:50.990
Yeah,but we can still hold
him for another 48 more hours.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.370
You can't hold a suspect
indefinitely with no evidence.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.600
Not indefinitely,48 hours.

30:55.610 --> 30:56.920
It's enough time to clear the campus.

30:56.930 --> 31:00.300
Can we please forget about tubbs for a
minute? Let's just say we have a copycat.

31:00.310 --> 31:01.220
What are we talkin' about?

31:01.230 --> 31:04.870
The most common examples are ones that people
don't always think of of being copycats--

31:04.880 --> 31:07.250
uh,kids who commit school
shootings,also teen suicides.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.550
They tend to come in clusters.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.700
Both models,we're talking about an age
range that's consistent with the campus.

31:11.710 --> 31:13.840
School shootings fit the
classic copycat model.

31:13.850 --> 31:15.710
They want their own piece of
the glory,they're competing.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.480
Ok,but that doesn't jibe
with whoever wrote this note.

31:18.490 --> 31:19.840
"He's innocent."

31:19.850 --> 31:22.100
It's about freeing tubbs,not
trying to steal any credit.

31:22.110 --> 31:23.940
So could tubbs have a partner?

31:23.950 --> 31:26.250
Yeah,sure. That's possible,but
I think it's highly unlikely.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.890
I mean,come on,look
at tubbs. He's a loner.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.680
He's antisocial. He's
not the partner type.

31:29.690 --> 31:30.850
Could be more like a groupie.

31:30.860 --> 31:32.760
After kenneth bianchi was arrested,

31:32.770 --> 31:34.970
he actually convinced a woman he
hardly knew to attempt a murder

31:34.980 --> 31:37.670
so the police would think the
hillside strangler was still at large.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.230
But tubbs subdues his victims
first. He's not powerful.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.810
Not to mention the stabbing
most likely means he's impotent.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.090
Groupie doesn't have to know that.

31:45.100 --> 31:48.900
All they have to believe is that
tubbs answers some need inside them.

31:48.910 --> 31:53.670
And whoever wrote this definitely
needs something from nathan tubbs.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.720
"I'm still out here.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.200
I can't believe he's
walking out of here.

32:32.210 --> 32:34.330
It's the right thing to do.

32:34.340 --> 32:38.390
Remind me of that the next time i have to tell
someone their friend or daughter's been murdered.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.830
You still think he's guilty,don't you?

32:42.840 --> 32:44.770
Your security cams up and running?

32:44.780 --> 32:46.930
- Yeah.
- Good.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.220
We're gonna need 'em.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.890
- I know you can't
stand me- - no offense.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.380
I'm just not up for this right now,ok?

33:06.390 --> 33:07.950
I need your help.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.940
I went to tell anna begley that the dorm
is officially closing tomorrow at curfew.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.840
She wouldn't even open her door.

33:13.850 --> 33:16.400
She told me she won't leave campus.

33:33.070 --> 33:34.510
What do you want?

33:35.040 --> 33:37.400
- You dyed your hair dark.
- So?

33:42.200 --> 33:43.960
What do you want?

33:45.550 --> 33:48.500
stephanie is flipping out
about closing the dorm.

33:48.510 --> 33:52.850
She wants me to make sure that you understand
that we can't stay here past tomorrow night.

33:52.860 --> 33:56.120
Tell her after tomorrow,I
won't be anybody's problem.

33:58.950 --> 34:00.440
Freak.

34:15.449 --> 34:18.070
*******

34:20.389 --> 34:24.389
Was my judgment clouded by a need to
make someone pay for sarah's death?

34:37.620 --> 34:39.600
Somebody take my clothes?

34:59.710 --> 35:01.320
I didn't know who else to call.

35:01.330 --> 35:02.850
What is it?

35:03.320 --> 35:04.830
CAMPUS SAFETY

35:10.190 --> 35:11.650
I want to talk to you.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.590
Um,I'm sorry. I don't work here anymore.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.190
Do you like it?

35:19.870 --> 35:22.530
Um,do--do
I know you?

35:22.540 --> 35:24.340
Do you want to?

35:24.350 --> 35:28.900
Every girl I know is either
bleaching her hair or buying a wig,

35:28.910 --> 35:31.830
and she goes and dyes her hair dark?

35:32.450 --> 35:35.140
I agree it's weird,but ...

35:35.150 --> 35:37.840
I don't think it's anything
to be overly alarmed about.

35:37.850 --> 35:40.040
Is there something else?

35:40.050 --> 35:43.470
I think I saw stories about
the murders taped to her wall,

35:43.480 --> 35:46.260
and there was,like,blood
or something all over them.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.910
What can you tell us about
anna's usual mental state?

35:48.920 --> 35:50.220
I don't know.

35:50.230 --> 35:51.800
No one really knows her very well.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.330
She doesn't play well
with others,you know.

35:54.340 --> 35:56.160
Anything?

35:56.170 --> 35:58.180
I know she cuts herself.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.070
She covers it up,but people know.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.100
Has she ever been
violent towards others?

36:02.110 --> 36:03.350
I don't think so.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.870
Does she ever talk about suicide?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.710
Talk to us.

36:17.030 --> 36:19.030
She talks about it all the time.

36:19.040 --> 36:23.370
But everyone makes fun of her,like she
thinks she's some goth chick sylvia plath.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.990
Hey,gideon,it's reid.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.450
Are morgan and prentiss
still following tubbs?

36:27.460 --> 36:29.130
I think I know who we're looking for.

36:29.140 --> 36:31.120
It's good that you called us.

36:31.130 --> 36:34.470
It's not just the others
who make fun of her.

36:34.780 --> 36:36.800
It's me,too.

36:37.100 --> 36:40.090
Gideon,we ga otbrunette that just approached
tubbs outside the security offices.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.970
Good. Hotch is having them
uplink the security monitor.

36:42.980 --> 36:44.230
Got it.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.130
Ok,they're on the move.
What do you want us to do?

36:46.140 --> 36:47.870
Stick with 'em. Keep your distance.

36:47.880 --> 36:50.750
We have video. Hotch and I
will be your eyes and ears.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.440
Got it. Let's go.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.590
I picked this spot because
no one walks back here.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.570
We'll be all alone.

36:59.130 --> 37:01.900
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.750
No. You're the one I need.

37:11.010 --> 37:12.690
Yeah,they just walked into a courtyard.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.730
We can't get an eye line
without them seeing us.

37:14.740 --> 37:16.170
- Got an image?
- Got 'em.

37:16.180 --> 37:18.800
Uh,the security camera
microphone is unidirectional.

37:18.810 --> 37:20.670
The audio pickups are
only good for so far.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.860
We've got it as loud as it
can go without distorting.

37:22.870 --> 37:25.260
All we got to go on
right now is a profile.

37:25.270 --> 37:28.470
I need you to get as close as you
can until he makes a move on her

37:28.480 --> 37:30.730
or either one of 'em admits to murder.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.790
Ok. Just give us the go.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.750
Let's get close.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.460
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

37:46.470 --> 37:49.240
The other girls were all on campus.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.540
What other girls?

37:52.270 --> 37:54.350
I know what you did.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.280
We could go to my apartment.

37:58.290 --> 38:00.960
- You killed those girls.
- You're wrong.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.690
Police let me go.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.840
Only because someone else
committed another murder.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.210
We can't move.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.840
No,he hasn't done anything.

38:19.850 --> 38:21.350
Hey,guys,talk to me. What's going on?

38:21.360 --> 38:23.000
She's offering him a knife.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.630
- Did he take it?
- No.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.400
She wants to be a victim.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.190
This is a trick.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.880
It's not.

38:34.490 --> 38:36.630
I want you to do it.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.670
I'm ready.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.260
I told them I'm not stupid.

38:39.270 --> 38:41.020
Please.

38:41.030 --> 38:43.590
I can't do it myself.

38:44.610 --> 38:46.030
You're crazy.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.770
I killed someone for you.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.690
I even liked her.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.590
Go,go,go.

38:53.700 --> 38:59.180
- Listen,you stupid bitch,I'm not gonna 
say or do anything to you.
- Where are they?

39:01.960 --> 39:03.360
Fbi!

39:04.310 --> 39:06.760
- Fbi!
- Put down the knife!

39:08.210 --> 39:09.430
Put the knife down!

39:09.440 --> 39:11.230
Morgan: Listen to her.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.650
Drop the knife!

39:12.660 --> 39:14.860
- Are you gonna shoot me?
- Just put the knife down.

39:14.870 --> 39:16.920
Nobody's gonna shoot you.

39:21.290 --> 39:23.110
- No!
- No!

39:27.700 --> 39:28.580
No!

39:28.860 --> 39:30.470
Call an ambulance!

39:31.280 --> 39:33.310
Stay with me.*******

39:39.560 --> 39:41.100
Two more dead.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.730
Was it a price that needed to be paid?

39:45.530 --> 39:47.670
Is death ever worth it?

39:49.140 --> 39:51.620
Was the world always this gray?

39:52.120 --> 39:55.180
Is it only in the movies
that it's black and white?

39:55.590 --> 39:57.540
Is that just an illusion?

40:00.900 --> 40:02.580
I used to know.

40:04.870 --> 40:08.450
I used to understand my place,my
direction,where I was headed.

40:21.970 --> 40:24.330
Profiling requires belief.

40:24.340 --> 40:27.040
Belief in the profile.
Belief in yourself.

40:28.040 --> 40:31.030
After sarah,I no longer
trust myself at home.

40:31.670 --> 40:34.890
But after tubbs,I no longer
trust myself in the field.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.250
And without that,I have nothing.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.280
I didn't even know you
could take off this early.

40:44.290 --> 40:46.020
Ah,we wanted to leave at first light.

40:46.030 --> 40:47.410
I get it.

40:47.420 --> 40:49.600
So I guess. thank you.

40:49.610 --> 40:51.520
- Thank you.
- Bye

40:52.810 --> 40:54.080
Gideon.

40:55.710 --> 40:58.110
you knew how this was
gonna end,didn't you?

40:58.890 --> 41:01.020
I never thought anyone would die.

41:01.030 --> 41:03.020
No,of course not. I know that.

41:03.030 --> 41:04.620
I mean the copycat.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.340
You knew the two of them would find each
other. That's why you let tubbs go,isn't it?

41:07.350 --> 41:09.750
Look,I trusted the profile.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.290
At best,it's always
just an educated guess.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.530
- It was the best chance of catching them.
- I know.

41:21.070 --> 41:24.190
Anna begley was ill. Her
suicide may have been inevitable.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.530
And tubbs?

41:26.380 --> 41:28.230
He killed 3 women.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.250
Right.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.980
What if we were wrong?

41:50.540 --> 41:54.560
I've been on the phone with the
flagstaff,arizona,police all morning.

41:54.570 --> 41:58.240
Did you actually allow a
disturbed college student

41:58.250 --> 42:01.680
to meet with a man you
believed to be a serial killer?

42:01.690 --> 42:04.610
We didn't know who,but we knew
a meeting would take place.

42:04.620 --> 42:06.090
We?

42:06.420 --> 42:08.300
I,ma'am.

42:08.310 --> 42:09.480
It was my decision.

42:09.490 --> 42:12.270
And now that student is dead.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.610
She committed suicide,yes.

42:14.620 --> 42:15.890
After killing the unsub.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.800
How could you let this happen?

42:19.140 --> 42:21.200
It was not the outcome we had hoped for.

42:21.210 --> 42:25.270
It wasn't the outcome you had hoped for?

42:25.280 --> 42:28.090
- That's your answer to me?
- Yes,ma'am.

42:28.890 --> 42:31.870
- Give me your badge.
- Ma'am?

42:31.880 --> 42:34.580
You're suspended for
2 weeks without pay,

42:34.590 --> 42:37.530
pending an investigation
of your conduct.

42:38.380 --> 42:39.740
And,agent hotchner.

42:39.750 --> 42:44.760
if it were solely up to me,you would
never get these credentials back.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.200
Always a pleasure.

42:49.780 --> 42:52.200
And that was the last domino.

42:52.210 --> 42:54.240
the death of that girl.

42:54.840 --> 42:58.330
Hotch being suspended over
something that was my fault.

42:59.300 --> 43:03.180
I said at the beginning of this letter
that I knew it would be you to come up here.

43:05.090 --> 43:08.310
I'm sorry the explanation
couldn't be better.

43:09.210 --> 43:12.620
And I am so sorry that
it doesn't make more se E.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.250
but I've already told you

43:16.450 --> 43:19.190
I just don't understand
any of it anymore.

43:28.860 --> 43:30.200
I'm sorry.
