00:05.588 --> 00:08.549
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.760
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

00:11.970 --> 00:15.723
...for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.517
Sure, neighbor. Come on in.

00:19.894 --> 00:20.978
Is Janine around?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.646
She's at dance class.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.148
Can I check my room?

00:24.357 --> 00:27.234
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.613
Oh, my God.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.617
It's like a guy never lived in here.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.122
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

00:40.790 --> 00:41.832
It is?

00:42.292 --> 00:45.836
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

00:46.004 --> 00:47.004
No.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.924
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.176
- No.
- No.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.637
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

00:55.847 --> 00:57.514
This is a "guy's" place.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.851
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.606
- You're right. I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her. Be a man.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.649
- I'm a man.
- Defend yourself.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.320
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.072
Be right there, sweetums.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.159
Totally different situation.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.327
Hey, guys.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.496
- How was breakfast with Hillary?
- Okay.

02:02.705 --> 02:06.375
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.002
Is this Hillary,
your hot assistant chef, Hillary?

02:10.255 --> 02:13.549
- Yeah.
- The one that stares at me?

02:14.008 --> 02:17.719
No. The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.140
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.643
Why don't you set us up?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.562
Ooh, are you setting Ross up
with someone?

02:26.729 --> 02:28.772
Does she have a wedding dress?

02:31.442 --> 02:32.693
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:32.861 --> 02:37.614
Rachel, I'm making up flyers
to try to get new massage clients.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.450
So can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copy machine?

02:40.660 --> 02:45.038
Well, sure, but they might think it's weird
considering I don't work there anymore.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.000
Oh, my God. What happened?

02:48.251 --> 02:50.127
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.796
Well, that's great. Congratulations.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.758
A year ago.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.387
You've lasted all year. Good for you.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.685
But, Pheebs, you could still use
the copy machine where I actually work.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.646
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.107
Kim will freak out.
She already doesn't like me.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.694
- I don't think my boss likes me.
- I don't think mine likes me either.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.780
Maybe it's a universal thing.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.701
Or maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.372
Yeah, let's head off to work.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.671
- Thank you.
- Sure.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.673
You will not believe this.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.801
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.012
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.306
Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.558
- Good kisser.
- What?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.518
What?

03:48.978 --> 03:50.479
- You kissed him?
- Totally.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.148
Phoebe, are you serious?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.859
Yeah, I was just in there,
he came in and introduced himself.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.363
The next thing I know,
we're making out.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.616
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.284
No.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.911
Phoebe.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.581
What am I supposed to do, ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.459
No, yeah, I should.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.807
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.686
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.689
Do you, uh, know this kid?
Is it a relative?

04:33.898 --> 04:35.816
No. I just thought it was cute.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.194
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
Okay, uh...

04:39.362 --> 04:42.281
Look, Janine, I really want you
to feel at home here, but...

04:42.490 --> 04:45.409
...some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.577
Oh. Like what?

04:47.787 --> 04:51.290
Uh, like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.250
We can't have that.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.253
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

04:56.462 --> 05:00.799
I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.472
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.934
I'm sorry. I just thought
I'd try and make the place a little nicer.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.728
Yeah, but it's too much stuff.

05:12.979 --> 05:17.274
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.445
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.824
- I just thought...
- I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.242
But come on.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.579
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.373
It's a curling iron.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.673
Oh. Well, that's okay then.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.344
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

05:45.595 --> 05:49.598
...and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

05:50.641 --> 05:54.728
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.773
- It's clean.
- Yeah, well, it feels different.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.399
It's dry.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.654
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.282
Okay, also, what is with
these chips you bought?

06:07.450 --> 06:11.078
No, no, no. It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.088
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.766
Oh.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.476
Kim, hi.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.311
Uh-huh.

06:39.315 --> 06:44.444
So I handed in that marketing report,
and I never got to hear what you thought.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.155
- I didn't read it.
- Ah.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.328
So, wow, the spring line's really
gonna be great this year, huh?

06:54.497 --> 06:55.705
Yeah.

06:59.710 --> 07:03.338
So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.092
Tell me everything.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.556
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.057
What's up?

07:16.769 --> 07:18.019
You know...

07:18.312 --> 07:19.896
Oh, my God.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.482
What happened to your teeth?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.067
I whitened them.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.821
Really?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.657
Yeah, what do you think?

07:30.867 --> 07:33.452
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.954
Come on, seriously.

07:37.999 --> 07:42.210
- They're really, really, really white.
- What was wrong with your old...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.129
...human teeth?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.675
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.887
- How much longer?
- A day.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.515
Ross, tonight is your date with Hillary.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.728
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

08:00.771 --> 08:01.771
No. No, no, no.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.108
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.861
She will be after tonight.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.407
Oh, Rach.
Uh, do you notice anything...?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.118
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.706
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

08:19.916 --> 08:24.127
...but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.629
- What?
- Oh, my God.

08:25.838 --> 08:29.341
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.469
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

08:32.678 --> 08:35.138
...it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.099
I am proud of all my friends today.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.102
Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe
made out with Ralph Lauren.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.523
Ugh. I'm so jealous.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.026
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.238
Chandler, please. Come on.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.906
Look at him.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.868
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.454
Hey.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.747
Here. Ooh.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.124
Who's the silver fox?

09:04.335 --> 09:07.796
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

09:08.047 --> 09:12.717
Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

09:13.386 --> 09:16.680
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.390
What?

09:18.599 --> 09:20.892
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look
like that guy.

09:21.143 --> 09:25.939
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack...

09:26.148 --> 09:30.318
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.362
What?

09:32.572 --> 09:36.199
Oh, God... I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

09:36.450 --> 09:40.704
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!

09:40.913 --> 09:43.456
Why would the copy guy
say he's Ralph Lauren?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.500
To get you to make out with him.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.127
Oh.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.843
Okay, maybe this will make them
look less white.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.016
Nope. Heh.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.060
Okay, so colors that don't work are...

10:04.312 --> 10:08.356
...blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.403
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.

10:14.071 --> 10:18.992
Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

10:19.201 --> 10:23.246
Oh, great. So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.583
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you...

10:26.834 --> 10:28.335
Whoa, whoa.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.837
We're not 13 anymore.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.842
Ross, this is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.011
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

10:38.220 --> 10:40.430
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.973
What?

10:42.975 --> 10:45.977
Half the people... I mean...
Just try it and see.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.687
No, I am not putting on makeup.

10:49.398 --> 10:53.193
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

10:53.402 --> 10:55.779
No! Demon! Demon!

11:02.244 --> 11:06.373
Now our drawers will smell nice,
and we didn't waste these pantyhose.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.501
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.421
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.715
We're supposed to organize
the wrapping paper.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.762
Yes, but I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side enough today.

11:20.971 --> 11:24.349
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.729
This has been kind of a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.482
It's okay. I just feel like I need
to be in a guy place...

11:32.733 --> 11:34.693
...do kind of a man thing.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.278
Go over to Joey's and...

11:37.530 --> 11:40.448
...drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

11:41.283 --> 11:45.036
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.915
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.086
I'm sorry. We do. We do.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.963
I don't know why I said that.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.802
Hey, Chandler.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.347
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.101
No, thanks, Josephine.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.606
Ross, I was wondering if...

12:17.945 --> 12:21.072
Oh, my God. Where are all the men?

12:31.375 --> 12:34.669
- Oh. Hi, Kim.
- Hi, Rachel.

12:35.254 --> 12:39.299
Uh, remember that thing that happened
yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.926
You didn't cancel the fabric order
from Taiwan?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.305
Okay, two things didn't happen.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.475
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

12:48.726 --> 12:51.227
Well, it turns out that's not true.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.480
It's not true?
Oh, that's interesting.

12:53.689 --> 12:58.234
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copy machine...

12:58.444 --> 13:01.112
...yesterday during lunch,
and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.532
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God,
you think I made out with him?

13:04.742 --> 13:08.036
Listen to me, if you think sleeping
with Ralph is gonna get you my job...

13:08.204 --> 13:09.788
...you are sadly mistaken.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.207
Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.751
Oh, this is such a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.880
Nobody made out with him.
I did not use my keycard yesterday.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.591
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.011
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.949
Yeah. Nothing happened.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.494
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.670
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

13:59.004 --> 14:00.588
Mm-hm.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.174
And someday soon,
I hope to open my own restaurant.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.759
Mm.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.513
You know, you're a really great listener.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.224
Most guys I go out with,
they just talk and talk.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.938
After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

14:19.984 --> 14:23.111
I've probably been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.448
Come on, I want to know.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.788
Okay. I'm from Long Island.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.666
I came to the city for college.

14:36.834 --> 14:41.671
Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

14:41.922 --> 14:46.467
...I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you. Hmm?

14:50.848 --> 14:55.310
So if you sear the stems
of the flowers first in a frying pan...

14:55.519 --> 14:58.354
...your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.399
Joey, that is such a great tip.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.237
Monica, can you excuse us?
I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.033
Okay, but, Joey, come over later.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.035
I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

15:12.202 --> 15:14.495
...out of just a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.956
Aw. I love birds.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.835
What is the matter with you?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.338
- What?
- You're arranging flowers.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.966
You got dead flowers.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.136
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.264
This is not Joey.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.559
Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?

15:36.810 --> 15:39.687
Flowers, they're just, you know,
nice to look at.

15:39.897 --> 15:44.442
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.362
You're turning into a woman.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.447
No, I'm not.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.158
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.829
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

15:57.373 --> 16:00.083
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.293
Oh, my God.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.337
I'm a woman.

16:11.095 --> 16:14.931
So now she thinks that I made out with him
and that I did it to get her job.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.725
- Why didn't you just tell the truth?
- I did.

16:17.935 --> 16:23.064
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.902
Well, what if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

16:28.112 --> 16:31.906
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.866
Did she ever think of that?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.039
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.041
- Just for a second.
- Ugh.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.170
- Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
- Well...

16:46.380 --> 16:48.715
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

16:50.217 --> 16:55.346
I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.807
Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.939
- That wouldn't help me.
- Oh, yes, it would.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.278
- I've had a really good time tonight.
- Mm-hm.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.115
You know, I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.868
Me neither.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.457
Uh, I've had a really
good time too, you know.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.210
Are you gonna eat that bread?

17:27.463 --> 17:30.173
Oh, I just like the smell.

17:30.841 --> 17:31.883
Mm.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.427
You make me laugh.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.973
Would you like to move over
to the couch?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.808
Mm-hm.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.523
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.401
How about all the way?

17:50.861 --> 17:52.070
Okay.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.037
Wow, cool poster.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.332
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

18:06.293 --> 18:08.419
So, uh...

18:09.046 --> 18:10.630
...where were we?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.136
Are those your teeth?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.554
Oh.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.767
You can see them, huh?

18:23.018 --> 18:25.645
Yes. They're insanely white.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.147
I did that for you.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.110
What's the matter with you?

18:32.528 --> 18:37.115
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.833
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

18:47.042 --> 18:51.838
Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

18:52.089 --> 18:55.258
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.968
Okay, look.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.428
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.433
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.768
Oh, really?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.396
Yeah, he dumped me.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.025
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.445
Even though you're a very, very...

19:16.697 --> 19:19.031
...very beautiful woman...

19:19.408 --> 19:22.827
...I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

19:23.078 --> 19:26.330
And I don't know why, but he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

19:26.540 --> 19:30.501
...especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

19:30.752 --> 19:32.503
...in the Ralph Lauren machine."

19:34.965 --> 19:36.507
You expect me to believe...

19:38.719 --> 19:40.386
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.865
Oh, my God.

20:01.116 --> 20:06.245
He just gave you the coldest look
I've ever seen. It's like he hates you.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.039
Then it is true.

20:09.374 --> 20:13.878
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.839
Oh, honey, come here.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.925
Oh, it'll be okay.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.637
We've all been there.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.308
You and Ralph?

20:28.769 --> 20:30.853
Kenny the copy boy.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.616
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:43.825 --> 20:48.079
- Uh, I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter? You upset?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.957
I'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of
all this girlie stuff in here.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.833
I, uh... I gotta be a man.

20:53.627 --> 20:57.171
Okay? The living room
has to remain a guy place, okay?

20:57.422 --> 20:59.173
That's just the way it has to be.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.009
If that's what you want,
I'll just put it all in my room.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.886
Good. Great.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.597
And, uh, thanks for being
so understanding.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.517
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.272
But you could, uh, put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.315
I mean, if you want to.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.610
Okay.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.613
And, uh, maybe the watering can there.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.906
Sure.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.575
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

21:27.911 --> 21:31.080
Joey, do you want me
to put it all in your room?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.248
Okay.
