WEBVTT

00:09.002 --> 00:12.039
- Could l have some suds, Coach?
- Yeah.

00:12.213 --> 00:16.592
Normie, how's it going?
You got Vera pregnant yet?

00:17.513 --> 00:18.711
Not yet.

00:18.889 --> 00:23.137
What's up? lt's been a few months.
l'm a little disappointed.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.885
l'm doing my darnedest.

00:26.064 --> 00:29.729
- Anything to get Vera off my back.
- Your back?

00:29.902 --> 00:33.317
l think l see a little problem
with your technique.

00:33.489 --> 00:36.739
Coach, can l have a pencil
and a large piece of paper?

00:39.245 --> 00:42.117
Anyone see Orosco
hit a homer last night?

00:42.332 --> 00:45.784
- What a fluke. A relief pitcher.
- Unbelievable.

00:45.961 --> 00:50.506
- Sammy, what kind of hitter were you?
- l remember hitting 21 1 one year.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.213
ln your dreams.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.379
One Scotch rocks, please.

00:55.555 --> 01:00.550
- l don't think you ever hit over 1 50.
- Wait, l got 20 bucks says he did.

01:00.728 --> 01:04.809
- You're on, sucker.
- Kiss that Andrew Jackson goodbye.

01:06.025 --> 01:09.476
lt's beyond me why you insist
on making a contest

01:09.654 --> 01:11.944
out of the most meaningless issues.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.654
No, on the contrary, Diane.

01:14.828 --> 01:19.204
We also address ourselves to some
of the most vital issues of our times.

01:19.373 --> 01:24.036
For instance, if south-east Asia were
to be obliterated by a nuclear attack,

01:24.213 --> 01:28.257
Norm would have to push a peanut
up Boylston Street with his nose.

01:28.425 --> 01:32.126
But only as far as the corner.
Come on, peace.

02:42.843 --> 02:46.842
Hi, is this Pequod? This is Sam Malone.

02:47.014 --> 02:52.307
l'd like a reservation for two in one
of your cosier rooms for the weekend.

02:52.479 --> 02:56.098
That's great.
l'll see you Friday night, late.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.111
- l heard you mention the Pequod.
- Yeah, that's right.

03:03.284 --> 03:07.662
That wouldn't be that charming little inn
that you and l went to last fall?

03:07.829 --> 03:11.165
l'm sorry. l didn't think.

03:11.334 --> 03:14.538
- This is gonna bother you, isn't it?
- Of course not.

03:14.713 --> 03:19.506
What you do now is your own concern.
Take a different woman every night.

03:19.676 --> 03:23.971
Actually, it's easier
to have them meet me there.

03:24.182 --> 03:27.931
lt's gonna bug you, me going there
with somebody else, isn't it?

03:28.104 --> 03:29.727
Not at all.

03:29.897 --> 03:32.814
This is bugging the hell out of you.

03:32.983 --> 03:36.021
l tell you what, l'll go someplace else.
l understand.

03:36.197 --> 03:40.942
Don't be ridiculous. lt doesn't bug me,
as you so eloquently put it.

03:41.117 --> 03:44.119
Yeah? Would you take Frasier there?

03:45.248 --> 03:49.826
ln fact, Frasier and l have been to
several places you and l frequented.

03:50.003 --> 03:52.127
lt's refreshing to go out with someone

03:52.298 --> 03:55.583
who doesn't slide across
museum floors in their socks.

03:55.800 --> 04:00.095
Those paintings look a lot better
if you go by fast.

04:01.391 --> 04:06.219
Anyway, l'll make sure they don't put me
in the same room at the Pequod.

04:06.397 --> 04:08.520
l could care less.

04:08.690 --> 04:10.149
Room number 1 2.

04:11.861 --> 04:14.898
That was a great room, 1 2.

04:15.074 --> 04:17.825
Remember when
that nor'easter blew through,

04:17.992 --> 04:21.327
and we had to stay inside
by that big old fireplace?

04:21.497 --> 04:22.992
Yeah.

04:23.166 --> 04:28.588
We listened to the wind lashing against
the panes, the rain on the roof.

04:28.755 --> 04:33.832
- Huddled under that big comforter.
- l never felt safer.

04:34.011 --> 04:36.087
Me neither.

04:37.390 --> 04:42.267
- You weren't there, Coach.
- l thought you meant now.

04:42.437 --> 04:44.430
Sam, please.

04:44.606 --> 04:47.276
Go, have a good time.

04:47.442 --> 04:51.940
- Just don't do anything l wouldn't do.
- l'm afraid l've lost that list.

04:54.575 --> 04:58.444
l remember you.
You're that blonde waitress.

04:59.665 --> 05:03.199
And you're Carla's incredibly
loathsome ex-husband.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.007
So we both stuck in each other's minds.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.009
Sit down. You want anything?

05:10.177 --> 05:14.259
- Thanks. l'll have a Coke.
- Be sophisticated. We're in a bar.

05:14.432 --> 05:16.010
Coca Cola.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.184
No, no. Order some kind of drink.

05:19.354 --> 05:21.596
l'd like something in a coconut.

05:21.773 --> 05:25.225
You're something in a coconut.
Two Scotches.

05:25.402 --> 05:27.810
Nick, this is a surprise.

05:27.989 --> 05:31.524
How you doing, Sam?
You dumped Carla by now?

05:31.702 --> 05:35.236
We're no longer going together,
but Carla dumped me.

05:35.789 --> 05:39.289
She dumped you? Sam, you boggle me.

05:39.460 --> 05:43.210
Wait a second.
l did dump that blonde waitress there.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.718
Nick!

05:48.887 --> 05:52.007
- What the hell do you want?
- Hey!

05:52.183 --> 05:57.344
- ls that the kind of hello l deserve?
- No, bend over and l'll give it to you.

05:57.522 --> 06:00.309
l gotta talk to you.
l would have come by the house,

06:00.483 --> 06:04.233
but l didn't want Loretta
to see my humble beginnings.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.065
l need a favour.

06:06.239 --> 06:09.860
Unless it's setting your eyebrows on fire,
forget it.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.872
- l used to drive you crazy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.746
l came because l want a kid.

06:17.962 --> 06:22.708
Shouldn't you be baking your biscuits
in blondie's oven now?

06:24.054 --> 06:27.257
l'm talking about one of ours,
the fruit of my loins.

06:27.431 --> 06:30.516
Would you like to use my office,
for a little privacy?

06:30.684 --> 06:33.140
- No.
- Please.

06:33.313 --> 06:35.306
- What's this about?
- As you know,

06:35.482 --> 06:39.017
l'm now married to the goddess
- compared to you - Loretta.

06:41.155 --> 06:44.775
She can't have kids
and it's breaking her heart.

06:44.950 --> 06:50.457
l don't want anybody thinking it's my fault
so l figured l'd take one of our old ones.

06:52.001 --> 06:57.707
You want me to give you
and that twinkie one of my children?

06:57.882 --> 07:00.968
- Product of my seed.
- Please, please.

07:01.137 --> 07:05.087
- This is outrageous, even for you.
- What's the big deal? You got five.

07:05.266 --> 07:09.050
Carla, don't let this recidivist
strong-arm you.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.930
There is no bond greater
than that of mother and child.

07:14.526 --> 07:17.563
He's talking of your babies.
The issue of your womb.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.525
Would anyone mind
if l went into my office?

07:23.370 --> 07:26.204
Carla, see reason.

07:26.373 --> 07:31.617
Take out an ad in the paper.
You never know what the kid'll look like,

07:31.797 --> 07:34.548
but l can't believe you'd be fussy.

07:38.177 --> 07:41.049
What is this, ''Days of Our Lives''?

07:41.223 --> 07:43.549
l want my own, not somebody else's.

07:43.726 --> 07:46.053
Mind your own businesses.

07:48.273 --> 07:51.227
l didn't think you'd be cold-hearted,
but as you are,

07:51.402 --> 07:54.853
l have to do
what l'm trying to avoid at all costs.

07:55.031 --> 07:57.866
- Breathe through your nose?
- No.

07:58.034 --> 08:00.192
l'm taking you to court.

08:04.459 --> 08:06.582
- You can't do that.
- No?

08:06.751 --> 08:10.620
My attorney assures me
that l got a very good case.

08:10.799 --> 08:15.092
ln fact, he thinks l can get all five kids
and you as a maid.

08:17.055 --> 08:19.297
l'm letting you off easy.

08:19.474 --> 08:23.011
Tom, you're a lawyer. Can he do this?

08:23.187 --> 08:26.604
Family law is not my specialty.
However...

08:26.774 --> 08:30.987
Wait, hold on there,
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

08:31.154 --> 08:34.107
What is your specialty,
blowing the bar exam?

08:34.284 --> 08:37.818
l'm gonna pass it this time.
Don't you worry about it.

08:37.995 --> 08:41.412
l won't. You've taken it
in every state in New England.

08:41.583 --> 08:45.367
This is a man who thinks
affidavit's a Jewish wine.

08:48.340 --> 08:51.378
lf he knows anything,
he knows more than you.

08:51.553 --> 08:53.629
- Thanks.
- Go on, Tom.

08:53.806 --> 08:55.383
We can't wait.

08:55.557 --> 09:01.394
There's a chance he could get custody,
if he can prove you're an unfit mother.

09:01.564 --> 09:05.099
Thank you, Counsellor. And who
do you think they're gonna pick?

09:05.277 --> 09:10.864
Me, a sincere, hard-working family man?
Or you, a hard-up waitress,

09:11.034 --> 09:14.319
who leaves her kids every night
to come to a sleazy bar?

09:14.495 --> 09:18.493
- Watch it.
- Yeah, she's off Thursday nights.

09:19.669 --> 09:24.580
l can also prove that you consort
with men of questionable character.

09:24.756 --> 09:28.091
What do you mean?
You got the morals of a sewer rat.

09:28.261 --> 09:30.385
Not to worry. lf you knew your law,

09:30.556 --> 09:34.555
you'd know a thing in the Bill of Rights
called the double standard.

09:35.979 --> 09:39.727
Watch the bureaucrats
take that away from us, too.

09:39.898 --> 09:43.434
You're bluffing.
Court costs money, you know.

09:43.612 --> 09:48.358
Unless TV repair has increased
dramatically, you make diddle.

09:48.533 --> 09:52.118
Every time you open your mouth,
you show your ignorance.

09:52.289 --> 09:57.711
The Tortelli Television Hospital has just
come off a record-breaking quarter.

09:57.878 --> 10:00.501
l'll tell you,
l got ten men working under me,

10:00.673 --> 10:03.247
and two of them is American.

10:03.428 --> 10:08.219
Even if l gave you those kids,
they wouldn't want to go with you.

10:08.390 --> 10:12.803
The young ones don't know who you are,
the old ones hate your guts.

10:12.978 --> 10:15.435
l don't believe this. Anthony loves me.

10:15.607 --> 10:19.901
He's the oldest. He remembers you
walking out. He thinks you're a creep.

10:20.069 --> 10:22.526
- He thinks l'm cool.
- Calls you scuzball.

10:22.698 --> 10:26.612
- He didn't learn that from me.
- Didn't learn anything from you!

10:26.785 --> 10:30.404
The nuclear testing range next door's
complaining.

10:30.582 --> 10:34.746
Nick, we're gonna be late
for that Menudo concert.

10:36.089 --> 10:40.133
Oh, yeah, Menudo.
l won the tickets on the radio.

10:40.302 --> 10:42.459
What is it, anyway?

10:42.636 --> 10:46.801
Go to your concert.
You ain't getting no kid of mine.

10:48.227 --> 10:50.517
l know how to cut this short.

10:50.688 --> 10:54.388
- l wanna talk to you alone.
- No. Forget about it.

10:54.567 --> 10:57.236
l got nothing l wanna talk
to you about alone.

10:57.403 --> 10:59.646
Just a little chat.

10:59.823 --> 11:01.863
Between you and l.

11:03.536 --> 11:05.528
Private matters.

11:07.289 --> 11:09.781
Well...

11:09.960 --> 11:13.709
OK. Sam, can we use your office?

11:13.881 --> 11:17.048
Why? What secrets
could you possibly have left?

11:17.218 --> 11:20.172
No, don't answer that. Use my office.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.966
- Carla looked nervous going in there.
- Who wouldn't be?

11:24.142 --> 11:28.935
Whenever Nick gets a woman alone,
he wraps them round his little finger.

11:29.107 --> 11:32.108
Well, Carla's a pretty tough little nut.

11:32.277 --> 11:34.602
lt'll take more than Nick can muster

11:34.779 --> 11:40.284
to break the bond between
a mother and her first-born offspring.

11:40.452 --> 11:42.991
Mommy! The kid is ours!

11:43.164 --> 11:45.287
- Daddy!
- We're a family now.

11:45.458 --> 11:48.793
- Let's stuff our faces till we get sick.
- Sounds good.

11:55.053 --> 11:58.338
What are you all looking at?

11:58.639 --> 12:00.930
Never seen a jellyfish before?

12:13.197 --> 12:17.196
Normie, l hate to be the one
to tell you this.

12:17.369 --> 12:21.036
But Sam's batting average
never went past 1 49.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.448
- There's the stat book.
- 1 49.

12:23.626 --> 12:26.795
That's right. l don't wanna be
the kind of guy who rubs it in,

12:26.964 --> 12:30.333
so just let me say...

12:33.805 --> 12:36.557
l have a little bad news for you.

12:36.725 --> 12:40.060
l bet the Coach that if you won
you'd be obnoxious,

12:40.229 --> 12:42.720
so l come out even.

12:47.695 --> 12:51.396
Troops, l'm back! What's so funny?

12:51.573 --> 12:55.524
Normie just lost a bundle
to Cliffie on a bet.

12:55.704 --> 12:58.908
But the Coach just lost a bundle to me.

13:00.501 --> 13:02.162
But the funniest thing is,

13:02.337 --> 13:07.629
it's based on the fact that you
couldn't hit a baseball to save your life!

13:09.304 --> 13:12.174
- Know what's even funnier than that?
- What?

13:12.348 --> 13:17.344
Cliffie spent 30 bucks on a book
to win a 20 dollar bet.

13:17.521 --> 13:23.145
Yeah? Well, you lent me the money.
You know l'll never pay it back.

13:26.824 --> 13:31.735
You know, the way you revel
in each other's defeats

13:31.912 --> 13:33.989
is totally reprehensible.

13:34.166 --> 13:38.413
Are you ever as pleased
with each other's good fortune?

13:38.586 --> 13:41.124
Who's had any?

13:50.141 --> 13:52.892
Boy, l tell you, it's good to be home.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.103
- How was the Pequod, Sam?
- Pequod?

13:57.274 --> 13:59.896
Was it everything
you remembered it to be?

14:00.069 --> 14:02.940
Diane, why torment yourself?

14:03.656 --> 14:05.650
- So you really went?
- Of course.

14:05.825 --> 14:09.360
Did you enjoy the fruit basket
Frasier and l sent to your room?

14:09.538 --> 14:11.945
- Fruit basket?
- Yes, the fruit basket.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.746
- The fruit basket?
- The fruit basket.

14:15.587 --> 14:18.458
Yeah, OK, we loved the fruit basket.

14:18.632 --> 14:22.214
- We didn't send a fruit basket.
- Damn! l knew it.

14:23.804 --> 14:27.340
Your heart wouldn't let you
go to that place with another woman.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.090
l find that very sweet.

14:33.149 --> 14:36.897
- She won that one, didn't she?
- Not necessarily.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.251
Hey, everybody.

14:52.211 --> 14:55.212
- Hi, Carla.
- lsn't it a great day?

14:55.381 --> 14:57.920
You know, as l got up this morning,

14:58.093 --> 15:01.676
and l was feeding my four
- count them - four kids,

15:01.848 --> 15:06.095
l said to myself,
''Carla, you are so lucky.

15:06.270 --> 15:11.857
''Think of all those poor human beings
who have five or more kids.

15:12.026 --> 15:13.983
''lnstead of just four like me.''

15:14.153 --> 15:16.857
You don't even miss this kid at all?

15:17.031 --> 15:19.107
l can't even remember his name.

15:19.283 --> 15:22.451
- Anthony.
- My baby!

15:22.621 --> 15:25.956
The one time l remember something!

15:30.130 --> 15:35.587
lf you felt this way, why on earth
did you give that child away?

15:35.761 --> 15:38.799
Because l could never say no
to that man.

15:38.973 --> 15:43.967
l never even wanted
to go out with him in the first place.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.138
He won me over.

15:46.315 --> 15:49.849
l didn't wanna go to bed with him.
He won me over.

15:50.026 --> 15:53.065
l didn't wanna marry him.
l didn't wanna have five kids.

15:53.239 --> 15:57.452
Our whole history is me saying no
and him winning me over.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.866
Like the other day in there?
He held my hand.

16:02.041 --> 16:05.291
And he got real close to me,

16:05.461 --> 16:08.581
and then he batted
those eyelashes at me.

16:08.756 --> 16:14.593
He said, ''Carla, you know
why l want that kid?

16:14.763 --> 16:19.889
''Cos he is a part of you.
He's the only part of you l have.''

16:21.396 --> 16:24.895
- Nick said that?
- Let's not even discuss it.

16:25.066 --> 16:29.479
lt's over, the kid is his. He's coming by
to have me sign the papers.

16:29.656 --> 16:34.199
lf you don't wanna sign, don't sign.
Stand up to the guy.

16:34.369 --> 16:39.529
l'll resist. But if l'm alone with him
for a second, l'll melt.

16:39.708 --> 16:45.047
Then, as a simple solution, we shan't let
you alone with him. Right, everyone?

16:45.215 --> 16:47.172
We shan't!

16:50.930 --> 16:53.302
Let's get this signed and over with!

16:56.978 --> 17:00.312
Carla, don't you have
something you wanna tell Nick?

17:03.736 --> 17:05.977
Yeah. Yes, there is.

17:09.201 --> 17:11.820
l am not signing that paper.

17:11.994 --> 17:15.281
You can't have Anthony.
l don't care what you say.

17:15.457 --> 17:18.328
l don't care what the courts say.
l want my kid back.

17:18.502 --> 17:19.913
Yes!

17:21.922 --> 17:25.258
You said Carla didn't
give a hoot for the kids.

17:25.426 --> 17:27.384
There's a new development.

17:29.932 --> 17:33.716
- l can't do this.
- What? What do you have to do?

17:34.896 --> 17:37.684
l just realised that
Carla and l are both women.

17:40.318 --> 17:44.399
And l can't do this to her.
l can't be a party to child stealing.

17:44.573 --> 17:47.361
Are you crazy?
The kid's as much mine as hers.

17:47.535 --> 17:50.951
l'm sorry. l refuse.

17:51.123 --> 17:53.958
l've got to put my foot down
about something.

17:54.126 --> 17:58.373
And when l make up my mind,
that's my final decision.

17:58.548 --> 18:01.252
While you're thinking about it,

18:01.425 --> 18:05.554
why don't we go into Sam's office
and have a private talk?

18:05.722 --> 18:09.471
l don't think
that's going to work this time.

18:10.729 --> 18:15.225
- Please?
- Well... OK.

18:15.400 --> 18:19.315
- But it's a waste of time.
- We'll be right back.

18:19.488 --> 18:23.152
You can keep talking
until you're blue in the face,

18:23.325 --> 18:27.537
but it's not gonna change my mind,
you're not gonna...

18:30.667 --> 18:32.292
Carla, sign the paper.

18:33.378 --> 18:35.870
What is this?

18:36.048 --> 18:39.501
Even a shot of vitamin Sammy
doesn't work that fast.

18:42.430 --> 18:44.055
- Sign the paper.
- l won't.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.929
- Sign it!
- Hang tough, Carla.

18:47.103 --> 18:52.441
How about you and l
go into Sam's office

18:52.609 --> 18:55.729
and have a private talk?

18:55.904 --> 19:00.151
- Don't do it, Carla.
- Stay out here with us.

19:04.121 --> 19:06.957
No, l have to go in there with him.

19:07.126 --> 19:11.704
lf l can stand up to him this one time,

19:12.798 --> 19:15.420
l can break his spell.

19:15.594 --> 19:18.961
- And l think l can do it.
- You gotta know you can do it.

19:19.138 --> 19:21.808
l think l can do it.

19:25.020 --> 19:30.098
OK, Carla's in there facing
the greatest crisis of her life.

19:30.277 --> 19:33.479
l want everybody to be quiet
for a moment,

19:33.655 --> 19:39.076
close your eyes and send her
your most positive mental energy.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.783
- Good idea.
- Guess it can't hurt.

19:41.956 --> 19:44.827
Come on, everyone.
This is important.

19:45.002 --> 19:48.335
One... two... three.

19:54.721 --> 19:56.963
Norman!

20:01.478 --> 20:04.148
Come on, Carla, don't be so cold.

20:04.315 --> 20:05.857
l'm a lonely guy.

20:06.024 --> 20:08.433
You're not lonely. You're disgusting.

20:09.488 --> 20:12.821
Fine, just hear me out on this.

20:12.992 --> 20:17.156
Anthony is the product of our love.

20:17.330 --> 20:21.031
None of that, either.
l've had enough of your sweet talk.

20:21.210 --> 20:24.625
- l don't wanna hear that stuff.
- All right.

20:25.715 --> 20:26.996
Fine.

20:28.092 --> 20:33.217
- No more sweet talk, no more touching.
- Right.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.467
How about l just...

20:37.561 --> 20:39.934
Stop it, Nick. Don't give me the look.

20:40.106 --> 20:43.143
No, not the look!

20:43.317 --> 20:45.476
Call me...

20:45.655 --> 20:48.359
- ...irresponsible...
- The song!

20:48.531 --> 20:52.744
- The look and the song!
- Call me unreliable...

20:59.043 --> 21:01.499
l'll get the pen.

21:02.381 --> 21:06.925
- Wait a minute, do that again.
- Can't get enough of it?

21:18.023 --> 21:19.434
Nothing.

21:21.444 --> 21:23.900
- Nothing?
- Zero!

21:37.671 --> 21:40.873
You should have stopped
at your dumb look.

21:41.049 --> 21:44.420
- What are you talking about?
- l'm talking about this!

21:47.141 --> 21:51.850
l'm impressed.
l didn't think you had it in you.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.105
This is the first time you stood up to me.

21:55.273 --> 21:58.109
You resisted my charms.

21:59.988 --> 22:01.150
You win.

22:02.782 --> 22:05.273
Wait a minute, there.

22:05.452 --> 22:08.075
l know better than that.

22:08.247 --> 22:12.411
Your heart wasn't in it. You know
how much that kid meant to me.

22:12.585 --> 22:15.622
What are you talking about?
l did my best.

22:15.798 --> 22:18.336
Maybe l don't have it any more.

22:18.509 --> 22:21.380
You have more of it now
than you ever did.

22:21.554 --> 22:24.509
- You just went easy on me.
- l busted a gut!

22:25.225 --> 22:29.852
Nick. You went easy on me, didn't you?

22:30.772 --> 22:33.310
Maybe l did.

22:33.484 --> 22:35.773
Maybe l didn't.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.198
Well,

22:41.368 --> 22:43.609
if you did,

22:43.787 --> 22:45.246
thanks.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.325
And if you didn't...

22:52.464 --> 22:54.624
Take care.

22:57.513 --> 22:59.006
Hey, everybody!

22:59.180 --> 23:01.469
l got my kid back!

23:05.770 --> 23:07.516
Come on, Loretta.

23:10.484 --> 23:13.570
Congratulations, Carla.
What's your secret?

23:13.738 --> 23:15.980
- She knows when to shut up.
- When?

23:16.157 --> 23:17.651
Now.

23:19.995 --> 23:23.281
l hope today has been
a good lesson for you.

23:23.457 --> 23:26.458
l hope it has diffused the notion

23:26.627 --> 23:31.586
that you have some magic power
to make women bend to your will.

23:32.759 --> 23:35.630
Mr Tortelli, l find you beneath contempt.

23:35.805 --> 23:41.678
Before you're so hard on me, l'd like
to tell you something about myself.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.230
What?

23:45.482 --> 23:47.938
lt's confidential.

23:53.950 --> 23:57.616
What? l can't hear what you're saying.

23:57.788 --> 24:00.114
All l can feel is your warm,

24:00.291 --> 24:02.331
that is to say, your hot,

24:02.501 --> 24:04.745
breath on my...

24:05.305 --> 24:11.285
