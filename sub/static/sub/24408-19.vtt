Well, knight girl, it seems you've completely

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
destroyed my sword.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
My sincerest apologies.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Perhaps I can take on another quest?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I will bring you a blacksmith to mend your sword:

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Dead or alive.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm kind of scared of this kid.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
No, young paladin, that won't be necessary.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
You have already proven your mettle today.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
We might not have our sword back, but what really matters...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
is that Jerry doesn't have it.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Now, who wants cake to celebrate the victory?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Hey, where is the cake?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Nom nom nom.
