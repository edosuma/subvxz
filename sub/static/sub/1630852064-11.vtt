00:02.135 --> 00:05.571
<i>[Dakota] We are trekking deep into the
Arizona desert to find a mining hospital.</i>

00:05.573 --> 00:06.905
[Tanner] Oh, my goodness.

00:06.907 --> 00:09.942
The amount of activity that has
occurred here, is unbelievable.

00:09.944 --> 00:11.510
- [Chelsea] Whoa!
- [Tanner] What the [bleep]?

00:11.512 --> 00:14.279
When I go into there,
I will be told, "Get out."

00:14.981 --> 00:16.281
[Tanner] What is going on, man?

00:16.816 --> 00:18.684
- [Chelsea] Dude, something doesn't want you over there.
- No.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.853
That entity is not nice.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.956
And it will do whatever
it can, to get you out.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.557
[eerie voice speaking]

00:27.894 --> 00:29.795
<i>My name is Dakota Laden.</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:33.532
<i>I'm leading my sister, and
two best friends on a road trip.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:36.535
<i>Exploring the most haunted
locations in America.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:45.878
I'm freaked out.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.980
<i>[Dakota] Experimenting with fear</i>

00:47.982 --> 00:50.849
<i>and how it affects our
interaction with the paranormal.</i>

00:50.851 --> 00:54.853
<i>Each night,
we separate and sleep alone.</i>

00:54.855 --> 00:58.957
<i>The catch is, only one of
us knows where we're going.</i>

01:22.849 --> 01:25.017
Whoo-hoo!
Let's check this out.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.885
How's it going there, cowboy?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.053
You guys look pretty.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.089
We have matching
dresses on today.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.023
We're sisters.

01:31.025 --> 01:33.158
Pretty ladies,
I think it's time to go.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.828
Hey, bull, we're over here.

01:35.830 --> 01:36.662
Over here, dude.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.297
I am hungry.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.299
- Should we go get something to eat?
- Let's do it.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.835
[Tanner] Let's see
what they got here.

01:42.837 --> 01:45.804
-[Chelsea chuckling] Oh, my gosh.
-What?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.941
Would you guys be opposed
to trying rattlesnake?

01:48.943 --> 01:50.109
Have you guys ever had that?

01:50.111 --> 01:52.144
- [Chelsea] No.
- No. It says "authentic."

01:52.146 --> 01:54.680
- It's gotta...
- [all laughing]

01:54.682 --> 01:56.748
All right, rattlesnake it is.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.119
- [man] Here's some diamondback rattlesnake.
- [all exclaiming in surprise]

02:00.121 --> 02:02.988
[man] And then we got
the prickly pear cactus fries.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.223
- Whoa!
- Great. Enjoy.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.991
[all] Thank you!

02:05.993 --> 02:08.560
- Are you kidding me?
- That's wild.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.895
What the heck?

02:09.897 --> 02:12.197
[all laughing]

02:12.199 --> 02:15.334
This trip has made me try things
that I never would try before.

02:17.036 --> 02:18.170
Mmm!

02:18.838 --> 02:19.972
[Alex] That's not bad.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.207
That is actually not bad.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.542
It actually just tastes like
a chicken nugget.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.810
It does.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.717
So, after so many freezing
overnights recently,

02:31.719 --> 02:37.122
I am very happy, because we
are in the Copper State of Arizona.

02:37.124 --> 02:40.959
Chelsea, Tanner and Alex are
grabbing a bite to eat. right now,

02:40.961 --> 02:44.796
and I've slipped away
to talk about our next spot.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.933
We are trekking
deep into the Arizona desert,

02:47.935 --> 02:51.103
to find an unsettling
mining hospital.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.706
Found in a town
near the Mexican border.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.509
<i>This was the only hope
of survival for those</i>

02:57.511 --> 03:00.913
<i>who were violently injured
in the nearby copper mine.</i>

03:00.980 --> 03:02.881
<i>It was dangerous work.</i>

03:02.883 --> 03:06.718
<i>Tunnel collapses would lead
to rockslides and cave-ins.</i>

03:06.720 --> 03:12.324
<i>Train cars would derail, amputating
whatever limbs happened to be in their path.</i>

03:12.326 --> 03:17.729
Accidents were so common here, that miners
were not worried if they would be injured,

03:17.731 --> 03:21.900
but rather when they
would be sent to the hospital.

03:21.902 --> 03:25.737
<i>When the mine shut down, the city
pretty much became a ghost town.</i>

03:25.739 --> 03:29.741
<i>But today, the hospital
is far from empty.</i>

03:29.743 --> 03:33.812
<i>People have told me that they've
witnessed several strange occurrences.</i>

03:33.814 --> 03:37.082
<i>Such as hearing violent screams,</i>

03:37.084 --> 03:39.551
<i>as if a patient
awoke mid-surgery.</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:43.055
<i>Smelling the overwhelming
scent of sulfur.</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:47.292
<i>And seeing men being
physically thrown across rooms.</i>

03:47.794 --> 03:49.595
<i>Many people actually believe</i>

03:49.597 --> 03:52.965
<i>that the copper mine, which
sits adjacent to the hospital,</i>

03:52.967 --> 03:56.101
<i>is actually a conductor
for the paranormal.</i>

03:56.103 --> 04:01.106
It's possible that this location
could be off the charts with activity.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.513
You missed out!

04:08.515 --> 04:11.717
- I have a feeling I did.
- We brought you something, so don't worry.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.118
Dig in.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.586
- What the heck?
- [Tanner] Oh, yeah.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.722
They had the best chicken.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.290
This is like an interesting
way to cook chicken.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.125
They chopped it up
into, like, bits.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.393
Must be an Arizona thing.

04:23.162 --> 04:24.062
How's that?

04:24.064 --> 04:28.100
It's a very crispy
popcorny chicken.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.402
You're not gonna believe,
how good the dessert is.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.670
What the [bleep].

04:31.672 --> 04:32.904
[Alex and Tanner laugh]

04:32.906 --> 04:34.406
You were just eating
rattlesnake bites.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.607
[laughing]

04:35.609 --> 04:37.309
Oh, my God. I might puke.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.178
- You said it was good.
- I'm never taking lunch from you guys again.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.513
[laughs]

04:44.717 --> 04:46.852
<i>[Chelsea] We get to
check off Arizona.</i>

04:46.854 --> 04:48.487
- [Dakota] Yeah, we do--
- I've never been.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.523
A lot of these small towns,
where we're headed right now.

04:51.525 --> 04:56.194
They were formed from the mining of
copper, gold and all these precious metals.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.531
So, you're saying, they didn't just
come out here for deep-fried rattlesnake?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.767
No, Alex, they did not.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.101
[Chelsea] Wait,
so what are we doing?

05:03.103 --> 05:05.070
[Dakota] I did arrange
a pit stop for us,

05:05.072 --> 05:08.807
and right now, we are on
our way to go pan for gold.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.741
We're gonna get rich.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.777
We are gonna
strike it rich, baby!

05:11.779 --> 05:13.845
When you guys read
the packet tonight,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.947
all of this is gonna
make sense, I promise.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.254
[Alex] Are we rich yet?

05:22.256 --> 05:23.488
I'm looking, guys.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.359
I'm looking too, guys.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.561
I don't know,
if I'm doing this right.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.762
- [Chelsea] This is hard.
- [Dakota] I know.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.964
Could you imagine,
people came out here,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.866
thinking they were
just gonna strike it rich,

05:34.868 --> 05:36.001
and it was not that easy.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.171
You know, I'm just
not seeing any, nothing.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.943
This is gotta be
the lucky pan, right here.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.446
I don't know how to do this.

05:48.147 --> 05:52.484
Come on, gold.
Be in there. Yeah.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.221
- [Alex] What are you doing?
- [Dakota] Just gotta get my--

05:56.223 --> 05:58.523
Make sure my phone's
still in my-- Oh, it is.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.158
It's still in my pocket,
my phone.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.827
- [Alex] That's good.
- That's good.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.329
Okay, I can't contain it.
I got some gold!

06:04.331 --> 06:05.797
[all exclaiming and cheering]

06:05.799 --> 06:06.998
I found gold!

06:07.000 --> 06:08.734
[all cheering]

06:08.736 --> 06:10.402
Fragment of gold, right there.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.039
- You did find gold!
- [Tanner] That's amazing.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.841
The sun's going down.
We're getting rich.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.175
We can't stop now.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.278
[Dakota] If you guys
think this is bad,

06:20.280 --> 06:21.913
wait till you find out
where we're going.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.815
[Alex] I'm pretty nervous
about this.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.218
You've never had to
bribe us with gold before.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.321
[Dakota] Okay.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.957
Here you go.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.362
[both] "Phelps Dodge Hospital"?

06:38.598 --> 06:41.700
<i>[Chelsea] "Found mere miles,
from the Mexican border.</i>

06:41.702 --> 06:48.707
<i>The once vibrant bones of the
former hospital in Ajo, now fade."</i>

06:48.709 --> 06:53.979
<i>[Tony] It was the hospital for the entire
mining community of Ajo and their families.</i>

06:53.981 --> 06:57.082
What it is today,
is an empty hospital.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.918
But empty is a word,
I would use loosely.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.687
It is filled with spirits.

07:02.689 --> 07:09.027
<i>[Chelsea] "The 30,000 square foot
hospital, sits on a four-acre hillside,</i>

07:09.029 --> 07:15.033
<i>overlooking the very thing that brought
hundreds of patients through its doors...</i>

07:15.035 --> 07:18.270
<i>The New Cornelia Open Pit Mine,</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:22.541
<i>a 1,100-foot hole in the earth.</i>

07:22.543 --> 07:26.745
<i>The mine was, at one time,
the lifeblood of the community."</i>

07:26.747 --> 07:28.880
To be a miner was
extremely dangerous.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.116
There were lots of accidents
that happened here.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.852
<i>[Jose] I worked in the mine
for 27 years.</i>

07:33.854 --> 07:35.554
<i>I hurt my hand one time.</i>

07:35.556 --> 07:37.956
As we were hammering away,

07:37.958 --> 07:42.527
I stuck my hand in the wrong place
and it just hit me on top of my hand,

07:42.529 --> 07:44.896
and it shattered all my bones.

07:44.898 --> 07:50.969
<i>[Chelsea] "The railroad cars carrying
the copper would often roll off the tracks,</i>

07:50.971 --> 07:53.071
<i>pinning those who stood nearby.</i>

07:53.073 --> 07:58.276
<i>Ledges that miners stood on
while they worked would break away.</i>

07:58.278 --> 08:02.013
And the men would be
swallowed up by the Earth,

08:02.015 --> 08:05.750
or trapped beneath the rocks."

08:05.752 --> 08:10.956
The injuries that they would
suffer could be really traumatic.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.092
Dismemberment, broken bones,
people being crushed.

08:14.094 --> 08:19.331
<i>[Chelsea] "And the mines allegedly
contained rare precious gemstones,</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:23.902
<i>worth more than the workers
made in a year."</i>

08:23.904 --> 08:28.039
Can you imagine the
competition among these miners?

08:28.041 --> 08:31.376
Yeah, there was some blood that
was shed over these precious gems.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.778
<i>[Chelsea] "When one was found,</i>

08:33.780 --> 08:37.816
<i>it is said they would fight
one another, tooth and nail,</i>

08:37.818 --> 08:40.819
<i>for the chance to
claim it as their own."</i>

08:40.821 --> 08:43.788
When they would get done
mining, they would go drinking.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.725
And then fights would occur over
things that happened during the day.

08:46.727 --> 08:50.061
You had victims coming
in here, who were shot.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.464
So, while all these men
are out here mining,

08:52.466 --> 08:53.865
what happens to their families?

08:53.867 --> 08:57.936
So, there was a mining camp,
and they would all live there.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.504
So, this was rough
on the whole family.

09:00.339 --> 09:01.706
Definitely.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.876
<i>[Rita] The hospital opened
before there were vaccinations.</i>

09:04.878 --> 09:11.716
<i>I'm sure that the children who came
through the doors here had TB or polio.</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:15.053
And there's just other childhood
injuries that they would have also.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.890
And the loss of lives due to
those diseases was considerable,

09:18.892 --> 09:23.762
both in some adults
and the child populations.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.098
<i>[Tanner] Dozens of kids took their
final breaths in their hospital beds.</i>

09:27.100 --> 09:28.934
That's absolutely horrible.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.170
I cannot imagine
living in a camp,

09:32.172 --> 09:36.942
- with all of these severely contagious conditions.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.009
That would be really scary.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.644
Really scary.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.980
<i>[Tanner] "Since the mine's
closure in 1984,</i>

09:41.982 --> 09:44.549
<i>the once-booming city
has become a ghost town.</i>

09:44.551 --> 09:47.485
<i>With several empty buildings,
including the hospital.</i>

09:47.487 --> 09:50.488
<i>It seems that the local
population of 1,000 people,</i>

09:50.490 --> 09:54.859
<i>may not be the only souls,
who still call Ajo home.</i>

09:54.861 --> 09:58.964
The amount of activity that has
occurred here is unbelievable.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.100
<i>We have captured everything
from screams,</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:04.803
<i>doctors calling out
for instruments.</i>

10:04.805 --> 10:06.438
<i>We have seen shadow figures.</i>

<i>[Chelsea] "Major surgery,</i>

10:09.142 --> 10:12.911
<i>found on the second floor
of the old section.</i>

10:12.913 --> 10:16.081
<i>The energy is heavy
outside this room.</i>

10:16.083 --> 10:20.885
Some walking by have even been
forced to stop mid-step,

10:20.887 --> 10:24.756
frozen in place
by an unseen force.

10:24.758 --> 10:30.762
I don't know what occurred in the very last
room on the left-hand side of that hall.

10:30.764 --> 10:34.866
But the activity that comes
out of there is unbelievable.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.968
<i>[Chelsea] People have heard
heavy breathing,</i>

10:36.970 --> 10:39.871
<i>gurneys rolling down
the hallways,</i>

10:39.873 --> 10:43.508
<i>and even patients
screaming violently."</i>

10:45.077 --> 10:47.646
I've heard children singing.
I've had growls.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.647
I've had voices.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.651
I've had my name said,
multiple times.

10:52.653 --> 10:57.789
Imagine being by yourself and hearing
a little kid singing in the hallway.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.026
- No, thanks.
- [Chelsea] Yeah, goodbye.

11:01.028 --> 11:06.031
<i>"The nursery, found on the
opposite end of the second floor."</i>

11:06.033 --> 11:09.034
For a room that should be
full of delight and joy,

11:09.036 --> 11:12.003
it's got a very
dark sense to it.

11:12.005 --> 11:16.007
In one of the rooms in that
area, I've actually been touched.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.511
And it was so hard, I thought it
was another person touching me.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.779
It was one of those experiences,

11:20.781 --> 11:22.881
I'll remember
for the rest of my life.

11:22.883 --> 11:27.052
<i>[Chelsea] "Fingernails have been
heard, rapping on the window pane.</i>

11:27.054 --> 11:30.622
<i>And gruesome EVPs
have been captured.</i>

11:30.624 --> 11:34.526
Like one that said,
'burn the children.'"

11:34.528 --> 11:36.828
- What?
- Nothing about that make sense.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.830
That's usually demonic
type stuff.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.498
And that's nothing to play with.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.267
"The laboratory,

11:42.902 --> 11:44.903
<i>located on the first floor,</i>

11:44.905 --> 11:48.406
<i>this room has an aggressive
male presence."</i>

11:48.408 --> 11:51.509
That entity is definitely
one to watch out for.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.112
<i>[Rita] I was walking in,
it was dark.</i>

11:54.114 --> 11:57.182
And I heard a... [growls]

11:57.184 --> 11:59.918
And I didn't even
turn around to run out.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.721
I just backed
myself out quickly.

12:02.723 --> 12:06.624
It's not nice and it will do
whatever it can, to get you out.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.026
[Tanner]
<i>"The vicious entity here,</i>

12:08.028 --> 12:11.730
has been known to violently
throw men, across the room,

12:11.732 --> 12:13.898
and hold them up
against the wall."

12:13.900 --> 12:15.066
Wait, hold on. Time out. What?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.968
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

12:16.970 --> 12:19.671
I've talked to people
who have seen this firsthand.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.006
And people,
who have experienced this.

12:22.008 --> 12:26.111
<i>[Tanner] "One seasoned group,
was so terrorized by the shadow figure,</i>

12:26.113 --> 12:29.781
<i>that they were forced to
leave the hospital entirely,</i>

12:29.783 --> 12:33.118
<i>after spending only
17 minutes in this room."</i>

12:33.120 --> 12:34.052
Are you kidding me?

12:34.119 --> 12:35.053
No.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.324
17 minutes is nothing
compared to 14 hours,

12:39.326 --> 12:41.159
which we will be spending
tomorrow night.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.061
"The basement,

12:43.763 --> 12:45.263
<i>home to the medical records.</i>

12:45.265 --> 12:46.731
<i>Several locals believe that</i>

12:46.733 --> 12:50.034
<i>the former employees would
perform inappropriate acts here.</i>

12:50.036 --> 12:51.903
<i>Away from prying eyes,</i>

12:51.905 --> 12:56.107
and that it has led up to a
build-up of negative residual energy.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.742
Well, what do you guys think?

12:58.043 --> 13:00.478
I really don't think the last
place prepared us enough,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.313
for what this has
in store for us.

13:02.315 --> 13:06.251
There are some things in
this packet that make no sense.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.454
Hopefully, tomorrow we can hold
our ground and stake our claim.

13:19.231 --> 13:23.168
- Another beautiful day coming to a very dark ending.
- Yep.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.836
At least we're richer today.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.938
We have so much of gold
in the bank.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.141
I need to come clean.
I feel really guilty,

13:30.143 --> 13:32.510
especially how excited
you guys are.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.546
I didn't find gold yesterday.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.881
I feel cheated.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.516
You are really
something else, Dakota.

13:38.518 --> 13:42.487
You guys made me try rattlesnake
yesterday without telling me.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.155
It tasted good.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.792
I wanted to get you guys back
and put a little bit of gold in my pan.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.127
So, we're kind of even now.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.061
- No, we are not.
- No.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.563
I don't trust you in
the slightest anymore.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.767
[Alex] Are we close?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.435
Yeah, we're getting
really close.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.004
Chelsea, Tanner,
you guys want to go up front?

14:00.940 --> 14:04.809
[Chelsea] It's definitely a different
landscape than we're used to.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.744
I actually got so nervous,
right now.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.713
[Dakota] We're getting
really close.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.850
You can almost, like, feel the electricity
in the air from the copper mine.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.018
I have a really
bad feeling about this one.

14:15.721 --> 14:18.022
- [Chelsea] Is that it?
- [Tanner] Oh, no way.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.124
- [Dakota] There it is.
- [Tanner] Dude, that's huge.

14:20.126 --> 14:20.959
[Chelsea] Seriously?

14:20.961 --> 14:23.094
[Dakota] See it now?

14:23.096 --> 14:26.297
- So, the mine is, like, right across the street?
- [Dakota] Yep.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.132
[Alex] Oh, my God.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.004
[Tanner] Oh, my goodness.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.506
[Alex] Oh-ho!

14:35.508 --> 14:37.175
[Dakota] Welcome
to the hospital.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.144
[Tanner] Right away I
can just feel the electricity.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.784
[Chelsea] Okay,
this is absolutely wild.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.086
[Alex] This is bad.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.021
Are you guys ready?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.489
All right, let's do it.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.828
My God, instantly feel weird.

14:56.830 --> 15:00.465
This is a really unsettling
vibe. Right off the bat.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.904
<i>[Dakota] We just set up our gear
room, right in the main entrance,</i>

15:05.906 --> 15:08.539
and now we are about to start
our overnight.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.643
I don't know if you guys remember
this or not, but a few road trips ago,

15:11.645 --> 15:16.915
I wore a T-shirt that looks totally normal
when you're looking at it with your eyes.

15:16.917 --> 15:20.985
But then in night vision, it looks like I'm
a rockstar wearing a leopard-print shirt.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.954
The rockstar shirt!

15:22.956 --> 15:24.622
Yeah, the rockstar shirt.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.658
We love that shirt.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.661
I mean, it looked good. And I
think I was right, the ladies did love it.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.964
Well, good news.
I'm wearing that shirt!

15:32.966 --> 15:35.934
Before, I thought this was
something to be ashamed of,

15:35.936 --> 15:37.201
but I'm going to own this now.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.438
I'm owning this shirt,
and I officially like it.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.974
- So--
- [Chelsea] Wow!

15:43.876 --> 15:45.009
Whoa-ho!

15:45.011 --> 15:48.012
I've decided, I'm gonna
rock this shirt all night.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.048
I'm officially not
embarrassed by it,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.382
and I do think
it looks pretty cool.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.319
[Alex] Yeah.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.254
[Dakota] Phew!

16:01.994 --> 16:04.462
Is there anybody here with us?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.198
If you can hear my voice,
can you give us a sign?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.467
Can you do something
to get our attention?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.186
[Chelsea] What's down this way?

16:28.554 --> 16:31.990
[Dakota] I don't know. I think it's
another wing of patient rooms over here.

16:35.961 --> 16:39.364
Dude, screw this hallway.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.135
- [piano plays]
- [people gasp]

16:44.137 --> 16:46.170
- [Dakota sighs in relief]
- [laughs] Sorry.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.438
Of course, you found the piano.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.207
Aw, what you gonna do?

16:49.209 --> 16:52.210
I just walked right past it. I didn't
even realize that was a piano.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.278
Phew!

16:54.280 --> 16:56.547
- Why does he gotta do that?
- [Dakota] Why does he gotta do that?

17:07.026 --> 17:10.962
[Dakota] Oh. Okay.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.038
Some of these rooms
are really destroyed.

17:26.111 --> 17:26.944
[Tanner] Jeez.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.646
[Dakota] Oh, my gosh.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.883
This whole wing, this is
delivery and the nursery.

17:31.885 --> 17:36.954
On paper, this should be a very
peaceful, positive area and it's not.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.458
People have gotten an EVP
that said, "burn the children."

17:40.460 --> 17:42.126
So, let's just explore,

17:42.128 --> 17:45.630
and check out the nursery and
maybe eventually, settle down, and--

17:45.632 --> 17:46.998
[squeaking]

17:47.000 --> 17:48.699
- [people screaming]
- [Tanner bleeps] Holy [bleep]!

17:48.701 --> 17:51.502
- [Dakota] That was a [bleep] door.
- [Chelsea gasps]

17:54.173 --> 17:56.340
[Dakota] It sounded like a
squeak. This... [mimics squeaking]

17:56.642 --> 17:57.975
[Tanner] Hello?

17:59.845 --> 18:03.014
That was so loud. There
is no air in here, at all.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.715
Like, there is no current.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.552
It's still, like this is one of the
first locations of this road trip,

18:07.554 --> 18:09.687
where there literally are
no open windows.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.989
It's dead still.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.858
Maybe eventually,
settle down and--

18:13.860 --> 18:15.526
- [squeaking]
- [people screaming]

18:15.528 --> 18:17.428
Maybe eventually,
settle down and--

18:17.430 --> 18:19.864
- [squeaking]
- [people screaming]

18:19.866 --> 18:21.766
I don't understand, but I want
to find out where that came from.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.633
[Dakota] Let's just go look.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.368
You know,
we just walked the hallway.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.338
So, if there is an open door, we
should be able to tell the difference.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.140
Hello?

18:31.009 --> 18:33.177
- [door thuds]
- [Chelsea] Dude! Jeez, sorry.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.745
[Dakota] No, it wasn't
even that.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.980
[Alex] No, that was a squeak.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.215
[Dakota] It was metal
or like, rust.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.951
Like a drawer opening or
something like, I don't know.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.318
But none of them are squeaking.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.621
Like, it had to be a bigger door.
Like, one of the metal doors.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.922
- [squeaks]
- [Alex] Oh, my--

18:44.924 --> 18:46.591
- [Chelsea] That! That's it.
- [Tanner] That's it.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.226
[squeaking]

18:48.228 --> 18:49.927
[Chelsea] That's exactly
what it sounded like.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.262
But it was loud.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.297
Like something opened it
with a lot of force.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.032
[squeaking]

18:55.034 --> 18:57.135
I don't know, if it came
from this room, though.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.570
It just came from a door
that sounds like that.

18:59.572 --> 19:03.608
I mean, that's the closest
thing that we can, like, pinpoint.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.677
It definitely came from, like,
between the nursery, which is here.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.247
And the major surgery,
which is down there.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.082
I just remembered this,
from the packet.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.251
They say that in major surgery,

19:13.253 --> 19:16.320
one of the claims is to hear
a gurney squeaking.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.089
And what if that's
what we heard?

19:18.091 --> 19:19.690
Like, I don't know. Maybe.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.726
That totally could have been it.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.728
I guess, in my head
I just thought of a door.

19:23.730 --> 19:28.232
But that is a claim people
experience here, is moving gurneys.

19:28.234 --> 19:31.102
Now that you say gurney, like,
when you have that word in your head,

19:31.104 --> 19:33.104
that's all I can picture now.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.373
Maybe eventually,
settle down and--

19:36.008 --> 19:38.442
Maybe eventually,
settle down and--

19:40.646 --> 19:44.682
Right now, we're gonna make
our way down to major surgery.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.851
I want to use our eyes,
ears and feelings,

19:46.853 --> 19:49.287
and see if we pick up
on anything.

19:51.924 --> 19:56.294
[Chelsea] Not gonna lie, this
hallway gives me the creeps.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.333
[Tanner whispers] Oh, my God.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.368
Oh, my goodness.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.072
[Dakota] This was major surgery.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.875
This is where one of the
main operating rooms is.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.178
People really are only
experiencing audible claims,

20:14.180 --> 20:16.013
that they can hear with
their own ears in here.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.748
They've heard screaming.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.717
They've heard children singing.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.986
And then,
they've also heard gurneys.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.290
We're just gonna ask a question
at a time and then go silent.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.193
And see if anything
wants to make itself known.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.531
Can you speak to us?

20:34.833 --> 20:36.267
Or make a noise for us?

20:40.539 --> 20:42.039
Can you sing for us?

20:43.008 --> 20:45.343
We've been told that
people hear singing.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.114
We were silent
for a very long time,

20:50.116 --> 20:51.916
<i>hoping to hear something and...</i>

20:51.918 --> 20:52.783
nothing.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.737
This is actually
the nursery right here.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.972
As you can tell, because
they left a crib in there.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.841
And there's a rocking chair.

21:16.843 --> 21:20.044
A lot of just really
disturbing messages

21:20.046 --> 21:21.846
come through
the digital recorder in here.

21:21.848 --> 21:25.850
People have gotten "burn
the children" on EVP in here.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.720
So, let's just sit down and
try to get some sort of an EVP.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.790
So, I have the digital
recorder in my hand.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.127
<i>This is a device that picks up
frequencies that our ears cannot hear.</i>

21:36.129 --> 21:38.829
And it's believed
to pick up spirit voices.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.265
I'm gonna set this down
on the floor,

21:41.267 --> 21:43.934
in between all of us,
so that nobody is touching it.

21:44.002 --> 21:45.102
Okay.

21:47.873 --> 21:51.709
If there's something in here
that can hear my voice,

21:51.711 --> 21:55.646
we have something right now
that can also hear you.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.982
Do you have something
you want to tell us?

22:01.153 --> 22:05.556
Who is saying all these
nasty things in this room?

22:05.558 --> 22:10.895
People today, they think that there's
something in here that is very dark and evil.

22:10.897 --> 22:15.032
Can you tell us, if this is the
truth or not or what you are?

22:22.741 --> 22:24.809
<i>[Dakota] We were asking
very direct questions,</i>

22:24.811 --> 22:27.044
<i>trying to get
some sort of a response.</i>

22:27.046 --> 22:29.080
And there was nothing,
nothing came through.

22:29.082 --> 22:31.782
We should keep
exploring the hospital.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.218
But the far camera
that's filming us right now,

22:34.220 --> 22:35.119
I want to leave that in here.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.320
And if there is
something in here,

22:36.322 --> 22:38.356
maybe that camera
will capture it.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.123
[Dakota] Oh, [bleep].

23:12.125 --> 23:15.826
- This is the laboratory.
- [Tanner] No way.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.163
This is where men have been
physically attacked.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.631
I don't know, if you guys
remember this from the packet,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.099
but this is where
that group came.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.002
A seasoned paranormal
investigation team.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.872
They spent less than 20
minutes in the laboratory,

23:27.874 --> 23:31.208
before they were scared out
of here and never came back.

23:31.210 --> 23:35.079
[sighs] Let's see, if we can
last longer than 20 minutes.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.358
[Dakota] Is there someone
in here?

23:47.993 --> 23:50.027
Is there a male that's in here?

23:50.029 --> 23:52.496
A man who doesn't
like us being in here?

23:54.132 --> 23:56.767
I heard that
you have thrown people,

23:56.769 --> 23:59.170
picked them up off their
feet and thrown them.

24:00.238 --> 24:02.206
Can you throw something?

24:04.342 --> 24:05.776
You know, that there's
been other groups in here,

24:05.778 --> 24:07.511
that have been
scared out of here.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.281
If you want us out, you're
gonna have to do something.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.321
I don't like this room.

24:51.089 --> 24:53.491
I feel like
I'm off-balance in here,

24:53.493 --> 24:55.893
like, everywhere I walk,
I'm like tipping.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.428
Dude, I was gonna say
the same thing.

24:57.430 --> 24:59.663
Like, it honestly feels
like an ocean effect.

24:59.665 --> 25:03.767
Where you're just kind of like stuck
at sea and the boat is just rocking.

25:03.769 --> 25:07.238
And the floor is even too. I don't
know why I'm feeling like that.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.808
There's something
in here, man. I feel it.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.079
[Dakota] I'm gonna
try something.

25:15.081 --> 25:19.083
I'm gonna whip out a new piece of
equipment, that we've never tried before.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.619
This is called the Mel meter.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.522
This is a device that picks up
electromagnetic energy.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.558
And it also picks up
temperature fluctuations.

25:27.560 --> 25:31.362
If anything comes close to me, the
lights will go off. Kind of like a REM Pod.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.964
[Mel meter beeping]

25:33.966 --> 25:35.466
I'm gonna set this, right here.

25:35.468 --> 25:38.002
Just so I can guarantee,
it's not me.

25:38.970 --> 25:39.870
Can you push that device?

25:39.872 --> 25:42.039
Can you push it off that ledge?

25:43.909 --> 25:48.379
If you can throw grown men, you
can throw that device off the ledge.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.386
Can you show us that
you're here?

25:58.023 --> 26:01.659
[Dakota] If you don't want us in
here, can you touch that device?

26:01.661 --> 26:02.993
- Can you touch--
- [Mel meter beeping]

26:02.995 --> 26:05.262
- [Tanner] What!
- [Alex] Oh, my God.

26:06.831 --> 26:07.932
[beeping stops]

26:07.934 --> 26:09.967
[Dakota] It stopped.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.037
And it's not Alex, either. He's
about six feet away from it.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.272
It's not Alex.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.107
I'm just gonna check
the temperature quick.

26:17.709 --> 26:18.842
[Mel meter beeping]

26:18.844 --> 26:20.511
- No, I'm not.
- [beeping stops]

26:20.513 --> 26:21.912
[Tanner] What is going on, man?

26:21.914 --> 26:25.049
- [Chelsea] Dude, something doesn't want you over there.
- No.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.352
You have to get, like, at
least a foot next to that thing,

26:28.354 --> 26:30.254
for it to even remotely go off.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.823
[Mel meter beeping]

26:32.825 --> 26:34.258
- [Tanner] Dude.
- Every time I move.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.661
- Can you stop?
- [beeping stops]

26:37.663 --> 26:40.030
- [Chelsea gasps] - [Tanner]
Dude, that's not good.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.900
We are so far away
from that Mel meter.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.536
There is no reason
that should be going off.

26:45.538 --> 26:47.705
[Dakota] This thing has, like,
a range of a foot.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.807
So, something has to get
very close to it.

26:49.809 --> 26:53.344
And it seems like every time I
get within ten feet, it goes off.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.113
- [Mel meter beeping]
- [Tanner] Dude.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.515
I'm telling you,
this is really weird.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.751
Whatever's in here,
it's almost like

27:00.753 --> 27:02.953
he's playing bodyguard
with the exit.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.923
Every time you try to take
a step towards that door,

27:05.925 --> 27:06.991
he steps in front of you.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.993
It seems very territorial.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.862
Then that totally goes
with all the claims.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.264
Wait, Chelsea, you try
walking towards the door.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.532
[Dakota] Yeah.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.036
[Alex] Nuh-uh

27:19.938 --> 27:22.172
- [Dakota] No way.
- [Alex] No way.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.041
Are you kidding me?

27:24.043 --> 27:26.076
- [Alex gasps]
- [Dakota] It didn't go off.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.311
So, nothing for Chelsea.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.147
She just did the same path
that I just walked.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.215
And now watch.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.754
- [Mel meter beeps]
- [Chelsea] Okay, what?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.789
Why did it not go off for you?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.324
Tanner, you do the walk now.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.127
- [Mel meter beeps]
- [Dakota] Bam!

27:43.129 --> 27:45.863
Dude, screw that.
Dude, I don't like that.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.532
That is so bizarre.

27:48.534 --> 27:52.036
One more time, Chelsea. Do
that same walk that I just did.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.842
[Dakota] Nothing.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.679
[gasps] Dude, that is messed-up.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.149
It's totally comfortable with
Chelsea, but none of the guys.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.051
[Alex] Yeah, Chelsea,
just get really close to it.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.153
See how close you can get.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.321
[Dakota] What?

28:13.591 --> 28:16.493
[whispers] Oh, my gosh.

28:19.798 --> 28:22.066
I am so close to it.
I'm basically touching it.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.467
[Tanner] What the [bleep]?

28:23.469 --> 28:27.104
[normal voice] Oh, my gosh,
you guys.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.839
- Dude, I'm actually, like, freaked out right now.
- [Dakota] Yeah.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.241
We've never brought out
that equipment before

28:31.243 --> 28:34.511
and it is giving us really
intelligent responses,

28:34.513 --> 28:36.046
- to exactly what happens in this room.
- [Mel meter beeping]

28:36.048 --> 28:38.749
[Chelsea] Oh, my gosh.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.184
- I can't. I literally can't.
- [Chelsea] Okay.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.820
Like, It doesn't
let me get that close.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.954
I don't like this room.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.890
No, this is bad.
This is, like, really bad.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.559
It couldn't even get
more obvious.

28:48.561 --> 28:52.162
That whatever it is, it is very
unhappy with us being in here.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.364
Are there any you guys also,
like, starting to sweat?

28:54.366 --> 28:56.533
Yeah, I'm burning hot in here.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.068
Are you not hot?

28:58.870 --> 29:00.270
[men] What?

29:00.272 --> 29:01.605
You're in a sweatshirt too.

29:01.607 --> 29:05.075
I feel like whatever it is,

29:05.077 --> 29:10.714
will not give you any freedom
in this room, whatsoever.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.916
I do not feel alone, like,

29:12.918 --> 29:15.152
this whole hospital, you
feel like you're being watched.

29:15.154 --> 29:19.022
But in here, it feels like
you're being scorned.

29:19.791 --> 29:23.026
Whatever is in here,
is incredibly agitated.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.028
I really want to
get out of this room.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.099
We have been in here now,
for over a half hour.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.602
We've made it longer than
that one group at least.

29:31.604 --> 29:34.271
But I can tell, why they
got so scared out of here.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.808
I mean, it's been nothing but
activity since we got in here.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.309
I hate to say it,

29:39.311 --> 29:43.380
but it's time to separate
and sleep alone.

29:43.848 --> 29:45.549
And I really don't want to.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.624
[Dakota] Right now, It is
time for us to go to bed.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.893
We do this because we believe,
when you're alone,

29:55.895 --> 29:59.730
you have a much higher chance
of experiencing the paranormal.

29:59.732 --> 30:03.534
We've all agreed on the four
scariest locations for us to go sleep.

30:03.536 --> 30:05.869
First, we have the nursery.

30:05.871 --> 30:09.773
<i>Then we have major surgery,
on the second floor.</i>

30:09.775 --> 30:13.043
<i>And then we have the laboratory.</i>

30:13.045 --> 30:16.380
For our final sleeping
arrangement, we have...

30:17.215 --> 30:18.515
the basement.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.050
<i>Whoever ends up
sleeping there tonight,</i>

30:20.052 --> 30:22.986
<i>they will be
the first person to see it.</i>

30:22.988 --> 30:26.156
So, those are our
four sleeping arrangements.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.859
<i>Tanner's going to write those
out on a piece of paper.</i>

30:28.861 --> 30:30.093
<i>Then we're going to draw.</i>

30:30.095 --> 30:32.396
<i>And that's where you go sleep,
for the rest of the night.</i>

30:33.331 --> 30:37.301
All right. So, Chelsea,
you draw first.

30:38.069 --> 30:40.170
[Tanner] Ooh!

30:42.240 --> 30:43.540
[whispers] Okay.

30:45.076 --> 30:48.445
[normal voice] No! [bleeps]

30:49.981 --> 30:51.048
The basement!

30:51.050 --> 30:53.083
[Tanner] No way.

30:53.085 --> 30:57.120
The basement is always bad,
and it's even worse,

30:57.122 --> 31:00.724
when you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.826
[man exhales deeply]

31:02.828 --> 31:04.962
- [Dakota] Alex is up.
- Okay.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.966
This ones feel good.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.703
Oof, the nursery.

31:12.705 --> 31:15.639
- [others groan]
- Oh, my God.

31:15.641 --> 31:19.009
- This is where people get like, dark EVPs.
- [Dakota] Mmm-hmm.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.178
We were there for, like,
a good chunk of time,

31:21.180 --> 31:24.581
but I'm gonna be there
for three hours alone.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.217
Who knows what is
going to happen?

31:27.219 --> 31:30.320
50-50, it's either me or you,
Tanner, in the lab.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.292
- [bleeps] No!
- [Tanner] What?

31:35.760 --> 31:38.128
No, no, no!

31:38.130 --> 31:41.265
- [Tanner] What'd you get?
- Got the laboratory.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.668
Honest to God,
that is the worst one.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.069
For me and the guys.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.005
I'm gonna be in there by myself,

31:48.007 --> 31:51.842
and we know for a fact, that
it does not want us in there.

31:51.844 --> 31:55.212
That means,
I got the surgery room.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.714
Which I'm still not looking
forward to this one.

31:57.716 --> 32:00.550
But I'm just gonna take this one
as a win, to be honest with you guys.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.520
'Cause I don't want to go
back to the laboratory.

32:03.522 --> 32:07.858
Well, let's bundle up
and go to bed.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.960
[Chelsea] It's gonna suck.
I hate basements.

32:09.962 --> 32:12.996
[Alex] At least it's dark in the
basement. You might get to sleep.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.065
[Chelsea] Yeah, don't think
that's gonna happen.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.338
[Alex] Awesome.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.043
[sighs]

32:34.052 --> 32:37.087
I am going to
turn on the Ovilus.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.958
<i>This is a device that has
a word database inside of it.</i>

32:40.960 --> 32:43.894
It's believed that spirits can
manipulate the frequencies,

32:43.896 --> 32:46.063
and choose whatever
word they want.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.965
If there is something
that can hear me,

32:47.967 --> 32:50.100
something that doesn't
want me in here.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.804
My name is Dakota and
I'm gonna be in here all night.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.806
So, I would like
if you could talk to me.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.175
I'm sure you remember me
from earlier.

33:00.111 --> 33:02.379
Is there a reason
you don't like men?

33:03.848 --> 33:06.183
Were you someone
from the copper mine?

33:06.185 --> 33:08.218
Did you work at the copper mine?

33:10.521 --> 33:12.189
I know that you're in here.

33:27.205 --> 33:28.338
- [banging sound]
- [gasps]

33:28.673 --> 33:30.107
[breathing heavily]

33:31.809 --> 33:38.982
I just heard a sound coming
from the basement hallway.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.421
- [banging sound]
- [gasps]

33:44.822 --> 33:45.722
[breathing heavily]

33:47.692 --> 33:50.027
[whispers] Sounded like
something fell.

33:50.828 --> 33:52.529
I feel like I need
to check it out.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.502
I have no idea what that was.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.185
[breathing heavily]

34:21.859 --> 34:26.096
I am not finding
a cause for the noise.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.065
Could it have been this?

34:28.067 --> 34:29.699
[banging]

34:29.701 --> 34:33.870
Definitely could have
sounded like that.

34:33.872 --> 34:37.908
I am not certain, but it could
have been that crate in the hallway.

34:37.910 --> 34:41.878
I don't know why it's there
or how it got there.

34:41.880 --> 34:47.217
<i>If that's the case, I have
no idea how it moved.</i>

34:47.219 --> 34:50.253
But it was loud.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.990
And I am wide awake now.

35:03.067 --> 35:04.334
[distant howling]

35:06.104 --> 35:07.504
[Tanner] Are you hearing that
right now?

35:08.873 --> 35:10.340
That sounds like coyotes.

35:10.342 --> 35:13.043
[distant howling]

35:16.481 --> 35:17.481
[distant howling]

35:17.748 --> 35:19.916
[Alex] What the hell?

35:19.918 --> 35:23.687
There's a pack of coyotes
right outside of this hospital.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.057
[distant howling]

35:32.964 --> 35:35.732
The things people hear
in here freak me out.

35:35.734 --> 35:41.171
This room just has so many secrets
that I feel like have been untold.

35:41.173 --> 35:45.275
There is something that happened
in this room that we don't know about.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.712
So, I'm gonna whip out
a digital recorder.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.881
<i>And I'm gonna ask some
follow-up questions,</i>

35:50.883 --> 35:53.750
and see if I can get
anything at all.

35:53.752 --> 35:57.020
If there's anyone in here
with me, can you let me know?

35:57.022 --> 36:00.390
I have a device in my hand
that will let you talk to me.

36:02.693 --> 36:08.231
Why do people experience
a dark energy here?

36:10.034 --> 36:13.036
Do you not like people
coming into this space?

36:18.042 --> 36:19.876
I'm about to cut on this.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.112
Is there anything else
you want to say?

36:22.114 --> 36:25.549
Is there a warning or a message
you want to get out there?

36:31.856 --> 36:34.524
[Dakota] Oh, gosh. I just
got really light-headed.

36:37.962 --> 36:39.029
[sighs]

36:45.870 --> 36:47.103
Oh, my God.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.040
[groans]

36:50.808 --> 36:52.375
I just got so dizzy.

36:55.646 --> 37:01.051
[Alex on recording] <i>Why do people

37:08.025 --> 37:11.061
<i>Do you not like people

37:16.033 --> 37:17.734
<i>I'm about to cut on this.</i>

37:17.736 --> 37:20.737
<i>Is there anything else

37:20.739 --> 37:23.573

37:24.542 --> 37:25.508
<i>[eerie voice] Kill Dakota.</i>

37:27.178 --> 37:28.245
[Alex] What?

37:29.046 --> 37:32.148
Oh, my God.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.516
This is going to sound crazy.

37:33.518 --> 37:37.921
I heard "Kill Dakota."

37:37.923 --> 37:41.091
<i>[Alex on recording] Is there a warning
or a message you want to get out there?</i>

37:41.459 --> 37:44.127
[eerie voice speaking]

37:44.129 --> 37:47.297
<i>[Alex on recording] Is there a warning
or a message you want to get out there?</i>

37:48.132 --> 37:50.166
[eerie voice speaking]

37:51.235 --> 37:52.269
[Dakota groans]

37:53.738 --> 37:55.205
[Dakota sighs]

37:55.207 --> 37:56.506
-[Alex on radio] <i>Alex for Dakota.
-[gasps]</i>

37:56.707 --> 37:57.907
[bleeps]

37:57.909 --> 38:01.044
Dude, I'm doing
a digital recorder session,

38:01.046 --> 38:04.447
and I'm [bleep] not. It said,

38:04.449 --> 38:06.283
<i>"Kill Dakota."</i>

38:06.285 --> 38:08.618
[Dakota] Wait, it said my name?

38:08.620 --> 38:10.153
It said, "Kill Dakota"?

38:10.155 --> 38:11.821
[Alex] I clearly hear "kill,"
and it sounds like, "Da-kota."

38:11.823 --> 38:16.593
[Dakota] No.

38:17.695 --> 38:18.595
[Dakota] Are you sure
that it said my name?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.230
[Alex] Dude,
that's what I heard.

38:20.232 --> 38:24.868
Right when I was asking, if they
wanted to send a message or a warning.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.536
<i>[Dakota] I thought...
[speaks indistinctly]</i>

38:26.538 --> 38:29.139
Within the minute
before you walkied me,

38:29.141 --> 38:33.076
I started to feel sick
and I got, like, dizzy.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.945
I still feel it, I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.715
[Alex] Dude, I don't know if
you should be in that room at all.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.917
Especially, after that.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.053
<i>If you start to feel
anything worse,</i>

38:43.055 --> 38:45.555
<i>we'll come and get you,
and get out of this building.</i>

38:46.123 --> 38:48.158
[Dakota] Okay, copy you.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.795
It totally did not say Dakota.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.864
Like, I hope that Alex
is mishearing this,

38:54.866 --> 38:56.933
and it said something
totally different,

38:56.935 --> 38:58.735
and he's just
not hearing it right.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.171
I hope he's wrong.
I really hope Alex is wrong.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.039
But I have a feeling
he might not be.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.009
[groans]

39:12.883 --> 39:15.652
[Tanner] Man, I have been up
here the whole entire night,

39:15.654 --> 39:18.888
and absolutely nothing
has happened to me.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.225
I don't know if I just had some
good karma coming my way,

39:22.227 --> 39:24.394
but I had a very quiet night.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.631
<i>[Dakota] It is time to go.</i>

39:28.633 --> 39:31.034
<i>I will meet you in
the gear room.</i>

39:32.536 --> 39:36.639
If there is truth to copper being
a conductor for the paranormal,

39:36.641 --> 39:43.079
it would make total sense as to why
this location is completely haunted.

39:43.081 --> 39:47.183
This is the first time that the
guys were completely picked on

39:47.185 --> 39:48.451
the whole entire night.

39:48.453 --> 39:51.588
Normally, we are acting
as the protectors.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.990
<i>[Dakota] This is gonna affect
me for a long time, I think.</i>

39:53.992 --> 39:58.528
We've been to a lot of locations
with very intelligent hauntings,

39:58.530 --> 40:01.364
and this, though, was
a whole new level of smart.

40:01.866 --> 40:03.533
<i>[Alex] The laboratory,</i>

40:03.535 --> 40:06.803
it's just known for
violent attacks against men.

40:06.805 --> 40:11.141
Every one of us felt like we
were lightheaded at one point.

40:11.143 --> 40:12.208
<i>We were off-balance.</i>

40:12.210 --> 40:14.978
It was unlike any other
place we've ever been.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.013
[Tanner] What has had
my head spinning this morning,

40:17.015 --> 40:21.851
is the fact, that Alex got
an EVP on the second floor.

40:21.853 --> 40:26.055
This was the scariest,
most disturbing thing,

40:26.057 --> 40:29.993
I've ever heard with my own
ears on this recording right here.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.895
- [eerie voice speaking]
- [sighs]

40:31.897 --> 40:36.533
I hear "kill" and "Dakota."

40:36.535 --> 40:39.102
Not only did it know
that we were there,

40:39.104 --> 40:41.037
but it knew who we were.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.139
<i>[Alex] The darkness behind
this hospital,</i>

40:43.141 --> 40:45.775
<i>the accumulation
of all of the hurt,</i>

40:45.777 --> 40:47.777
<i>all of the accidents in the mine</i>

40:47.779 --> 40:49.846
and all of the death
that this hospital has seen.

40:49.848 --> 40:54.818
It's everything bundled up into one
that's creating this dark force there.

40:54.820 --> 40:59.789
Hopefully this entity, whatever
that was, it stays at the hospital.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.593
There's always a chance that this
could attach itself to me and follow me.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.028
There's really no stopping it.

41:05.030 --> 41:10.600
Dakota is someone who will
hold on to something like that.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.770
I'm actually nervous
that he will carry that fear

41:13.772 --> 41:17.907
and just that targeted
communication with him.

41:17.909 --> 41:21.578
I was in serious fear
of my health and my safety.

41:21.580 --> 41:25.114
This entity has a major grudge

41:25.116 --> 41:29.185
and I got to feel the
wrath of it last night.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.889
Chelsea's, up next. We all
know how her locations go.

41:32.891 --> 41:35.792
She usually has her
crosshairs set for Dakota.

41:35.794 --> 41:39.729
And I'm gonna do whatever I can
to not be the target of her wrath.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.065
I can guarantee you,

41:42.067 --> 41:45.802
it's going to take
a full tank of gas

41:45.804 --> 41:49.706
<i>to be able to take
on my next location.</i>

41:49.708 --> 41:53.943
And if these guys
show up with anything less.

41:53.945 --> 41:57.213
It's going to be
a very difficult night.

42:00.217 --> 42:02.218
