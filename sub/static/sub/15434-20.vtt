00:02.290 --> 00:04.810
you have been cold and 
you have been distant.

00:04.820 --> 00:07.270
I am three days away from the 
launch of my presidential campaign.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.530
I am a little tense.

00:08.540 --> 00:11.070
Steve's polishing the revisions 
on the revised tenth draft.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.720
Twelfth if you don't count the ten 
that I didn't show him before that.

00:13.730 --> 00:16.040
he's really a wonderful teacher.

00:16.050 --> 00:16.980
I really like him.

00:16.990 --> 00:18.170
Yeah,I can tell.

00:18.188 --> 00:19.350
He just dumped me.

00:19.363 --> 00:21.331
We've been sleeping together for like a month.

00:21.343 --> 00:24.568
You're smart and you're funny,and I'M.

00:24.871 --> 00:26.989
I sort of can't stop thinking about you.

00:27.239 --> 00:31.131
I'm really screwed up here because I'm falling in love with a saint.

00:31.148 --> 00:32.631
I love you,too.

00:33.686 --> 00:35.171
sarah's husband joe.

00:35.187 --> 00:36.390
our--our joe?

00:36.406 --> 00:37.512
He kissed me.

00:37.527 --> 00:38.553
What?

00:40.705 --> 00:42.382
I don't--I don't know how it happened.

00:42.395 --> 00:45.510
He was showing me a chord,and then he just.

00:46.845 --> 00:48.541
leaned in,and he kissed me.

00:51.048 --> 00:52.341
Joe kissed you.

00:53.608 --> 00:54.450
Oh,god,I shouldn't have said anything.

00:54.468 --> 00:55.763
What? Look,no,we are-- 

00:56.037 --> 00:57.800
we are seriously an affectionate family,

00:57.817 --> 00:59.182
like annoyingly affectionate.

00:59.197 --> 01:00.802
I mean,constant hugs and kisses.

01:00.815 --> 01:02.751
So maybe--maybe this was just a platonic thing.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.650
It wasn't platonic,trust me.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.290
Oh,god,this is bad.

01:09.307 --> 01:10.251
Oh,this is bad.

01:10.266 --> 01:11.482
Are you--are you okay?

01:11.905 --> 01:12.970
Yeah,I'm fine.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.300
I'm--I'm just a little,um,

01:15.317 --> 01:16.372
a little weirded out.

01:16.388 --> 01:17.391
What was he thinking?

01:17.407 --> 01:18.712
Oh,god,why was i even over there?

01:18.728 --> 01:19.942
I mean,maybe he misinterpreted-- 

01:19.957 --> 01:22.132
hey,he's married,okay?

01:22.147 --> 01:23.102
And you're his wife's sister.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.773
There is nothing to misinterpret.

01:26.155 --> 01:27.501
It was one kiss.

01:27.517 --> 01:28.832
Let's just forget it happened.

01:28.846 --> 01:32.162
Okay,you can't tell me that my brother-in-law made a pass at you and then tell me to forget it.

01:32.178 --> 01:33.220
I'm sorry,I can't do that.

01:33.235 --> 01:35.090
You promised me you wouldn't say anything.

01:35.108 --> 01:37.183
W-why are you protecting him?

01:37.198 --> 01:39.283
Justin,this has nothing to do with joe.

01:40.427 --> 01:43.252
I mean,seriously,do you have any idea what it's like being around your family?

01:43.265 --> 01:44.093
It's terrifying.

01:44.106 --> 01:47.192
It's like they're just waiting for me to screw up so they can hate me like they hate my mom.

01:47.206 --> 01:48.010
Okay,that's not true.

01:48.028 --> 01:49.372
They've all been trying to accept you,rebecca.

01:49.387 --> 01:52.053
I know,I know.They're trying to be nice and decent because logically,

01:52.067 --> 01:53.351
they know that none of this is my fault,

01:53.656 --> 01:55.551
but I mean,god,when they look at me,I'm like this walking,

01:55.567 --> 01:59.033
talking reminder that your-- that our dad was a liar.

02:00.757 --> 02:04.461
Please,justin,I mean,if something happens with sarah and joe's marriage,

02:04.476 --> 02:06.002
they're gonna blame me,and you know it.

02:06.846 --> 02:09.372
Don't give them any ammunition to hate me.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.713
Excuse me,mark.

02:16.127 --> 02:17.261
Hi,nora.

02:17.278 --> 02:18.772
Uh,I hope I'm not interrupting.

02:18.786 --> 02:22.750
I-I just need your signature on this change of grade form.

02:22.765 --> 02:24.241
There seems to have been some sort of clerical error.

02:24.256 --> 02:25.563
You failed.

02:26.465 --> 02:28.100
Well,you can't fail me.

02:28.118 --> 02:30.961
You--you told me my writing was smart and urbane.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.283
And I stand by that.

02:34.677 --> 02:36.313
Here's the syllabus.

02:37.046 --> 02:38.311
Read rule one.

02:40.105 --> 02:42.492
Attendance mandat-- 

02:43.936 --> 02:45.390
you've gotta be joking.

02:45.407 --> 02:46.873
I missed one class.

02:46.887 --> 02:48.693
I caught a cold from my grandchildren-- 

02:48.705 --> 02:50.192
keats had consumption.

02:50.205 --> 02:53.182
Flannery o'connor had lupus.D.H.Lawrence had malaria.

02:53.197 --> 02:54.751
I can't believe you're this rigid.

02:54.765 --> 02:55.960
Oh,okay.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.770
If you're-- if you're so concerned about your grade,

02:58.787 --> 03:00.751
how about a makeup session?

03:01.255 --> 03:02.632
you free this weekend?

03:03.255 --> 03:04.811
I know a great restaurant.

03:06.557 --> 03:07.483
Wait a minute.

03:07.498 --> 03:08.480
This is not a class.

03:08.496 --> 03:09.413
You're asking me out.

03:09.897 --> 03:12.340
Is this because I wouldn't go out on a date with you?

03:12.355 --> 03:13.940
If it is,mister,let me tell you right now,

03:13.956 --> 03:15.131
that's sexual harassment,

03:15.146 --> 03:17.120
and I don't plan to take that lying down.

03:17.137 --> 03:19.751
The jokes that are running through my mind right now.

03:19.765 --> 03:21.162
well,keep them there.

03:21.176 --> 03:22.330
This is extortion.

03:22.345 --> 03:26.661
I prefer to think of it as a mutually beneficial nudge in the right direction.

03:26.947 --> 03:28.172
Okay.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.022
Fine.

03:32.196 --> 03:33.233
I'll gO.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.511
Great.

03:34.525 --> 03:38.153
But I won't get dressed up,and I won't have a good time.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.242
And afterward.

03:40.527 --> 03:41.811
I expect an A.

03:41.826 --> 03:44.170
The class is pass/fail,nora.

03:44.895 --> 03:47.322
I expect an A.

03:47.337 --> 03:48.442
that was a disaster.

03:48.455 --> 03:49.391
oh,so you were late.

03:49.408 --> 03:51.892
Nobody expects the fund-raising things to start on time.

03:51.906 --> 03:53.812
If I paid $2,300 a head,I would.

03:53.828 --> 03:55.473
And I need to be better prepped on the guest list.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.601
I called dennis locklin's wife colleen.

03:58.115 --> 03:59.023
It's maureen.

03:59.035 --> 04:00.173
I know,she told me.

04:00.186 --> 04:01.640
The sea bass was tasty.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.452
And endangered.

04:02.465 --> 04:04.753
I'm the only republican working my ass off on the environment.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.591
You'd think the staff would be able to put together an event that starts on time

04:07.605 --> 04:09.661
and doesn't make me look like a grade-a hypocrite.

04:09.677 --> 04:10.632
I'll talk to them.

04:10.648 --> 04:13.672
Steve,can I see the new draft of that speech for the ride to L.A.?

04:13.688 --> 04:15.141
Uh,you just asked for it an hour ago.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.192
I don't have the new one yet.

04:16.206 --> 04:19.063
I could show you the old one for both of our sakes,

04:19.077 --> 04:20.752
I'm gonna pretend that the old one doesn't exist.

04:20.767 --> 04:22.633
Senator,I do put effort into my work.

04:22.645 --> 04:23.370
Oh,come on,steve.

04:23.386 --> 04:24.253
Hope?

04:24.267 --> 04:25.573
Everybody's talking about hope.

04:25.588 --> 04:26.641
It's the biggest cliche in politics.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.082
All right,that's it.That's it.

04:28.095 --> 04:29.693
Walk away.Take a breath.

04:29.707 --> 04:31.140
Take ten breaths.Count to ten.

04:31.157 --> 04:32.032
Do whatever you need to do.

04:32.047 --> 04:33.093
Just--just go.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.241
Yeah,go.

04:34.736 --> 04:35.661
Hey,guys,come on.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.730
Where are the cars?

04:36.748 --> 04:37.461
they're on the way.

04:37.475 --> 04:38.940
look,steve,I'm sorry.

04:38.957 --> 04:42.123
You know,you just have to understand that it has been a really bad day.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.663
He's gone from being a politician to being a permanent fund-raiser.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.051
So you want me to feel sorry for him?

04:46.068 --> 04:48.991
No,no,I'm not asking you to feel sorry for him.

04:49.005 --> 04:51.240
I'm just saying try and understand.

04:51.304 --> 04:52.031
This is the way it is.

04:52.043 --> 04:54.578
I postponed law school to work on his campaign because I thought that

04:54.581 --> 04:58.069
he was the only candidate capable of taking the country into a new direction but--

04:58.479 --> 05:00.463
I actually thought it was an honor to get this job.

05:00.475 --> 05:01.462
Well,he appreciates that.

05:01.476 --> 05:02.940
He's told me a hundred times.

05:02.955 --> 05:05.560
Well,then why do I feel so beat up every time I show him my work?

05:07.695 --> 05:08.652
You know,I don't know.

05:08.665 --> 05:10.661
Just,uh,get back to L.A.

05:10.976 --> 05:12.310
You take the helicopter.

05:12.328 --> 05:13.521
Work on your speech in the morning.

05:13.535 --> 05:14.732
He's expecting it tonight.

05:14.747 --> 05:15.590
Don't worry about it.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.863
I'm taking him with me.

05:16.877 --> 05:17.552
Go.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.091
And--and hopefully tomorrow when you see him,

05:19.107 --> 05:20.190
he'll be a little more human.

05:20.546 --> 05:21.751
Thanks,kitty.

05:21.767 --> 05:22.863
Thank you,steve.

05:22.878 --> 05:24.192
Ugh,finally.My god.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.172
All right,let's go.

05:25.185 --> 05:26.133
Gotta get the chopper.

05:26.145 --> 05:27.071
You know what,honey?

05:27.086 --> 05:28.230
We're not going in the chopper.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.351
What do you mean? I have to get to L.A.

05:29.368 --> 05:33.171
You are on the verge of alienating your entire staff,including me.

05:33.738 --> 05:35.051
Now I'm taking you back to the ranch,

05:35.065 --> 05:37.321
and I don't know what I'm gonna have to do,but if I have to,

05:37.337 --> 05:38.752
I'm gonna force you to relax.

05:38.765 --> 05:40.272
Anyou just made that decision by yourself?

05:41.356 --> 05:42.313
That's a little bossy.

05:44.276 --> 05:45.710
I like it.

05:45.716 --> 05:46.563
What about the speech?

05:46.576 --> 05:48.593
I gave steve the night off,too.

05:49.136 --> 05:50.481
Get in the car.

05:55.827 --> 05:57.301
Okay,well,don't worry about me.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.813
I'll open my own door.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.431
Hiya,justin,come on in.

06:02.156 --> 06:02.963
What's up?

06:02.975 --> 06:05.032
Ah,well,uh,sarah's at work,kids are at school.

06:05.045 --> 06:06.520
I've been,uh,meaning to call you--

06:06.537 --> 06:08.123
I know what happened with you and rebecca.

06:09.925 --> 06:11.421
that you kissed her.

06:12.257 --> 06:14.043
That's what she told you?

06:14.657 --> 06:15.793
Justin,there's more to it th--

06:15.808 --> 06:17.353
look,don't want the details.

06:22.335 --> 06:23.722
- It was a mistake. 
- Are you gonna tell sarah?

06:23.737 --> 06:24.822
I wasn't planning on it,no.

06:24.836 --> 06:27.240
Look,I'm an addict,okay?

06:27.256 --> 06:28.620
Lying is second nature to me.

06:28.636 --> 06:29.623
But it is selfish,and it is easy,

06:29.637 --> 06:32.121
and in the end,people get hurt.

06:32.135 --> 06:33.920
Okay,maybe it'll take a year or two years,

06:33.936 --> 06:35.750
or in my dad's case 20 years,but you know what?

06:35.768 --> 06:37.940
The truth always comes out.

06:37.958 --> 06:38.862
I'm not your dad.

06:38.877 --> 06:43.601
Come clean with sarah and do what he couldn'T.O?

06:44.606 --> 06:46.011
if i donn't

06:46.348 --> 06:48.221
Then I will.

06:55.028 --> 06:59.100
okay,so bottom line,how much more do we need to raise prices to offset losses?

06:59.705 --> 07:01.563
Oh,god.Okay.

07:02.768 --> 07:04.380
I'll get back to you.

07:10.236 --> 07:12.313
it's all fine early start on spring cleaning?

07:13.137 --> 07:14.791
No.

07:16.776 --> 07:17.731
We're going camping.

07:17.745 --> 07:18.662
Oh,god.When?

07:18.676 --> 07:19.550
This weekend.

07:19.566 --> 07:21.933
I got the gear out of the garage,gassed up the car.

07:21.945 --> 07:23.731
I can't this weekend,joe.

07:24.285 --> 07:25.301
I'm swamped at work.

07:25.316 --> 07:28.582
Which makes this weekend like every other weekend for the past year.

07:28.597 --> 07:29.702
So come on.

07:29.716 --> 07:30.570
It's only two days off.

07:30.587 --> 07:35.942
Oh,sleeping on the ground in a musty old tent eating rehydrated chicken pot pie 

07:35.955 --> 07:38.110
doesn't really count as time off.

07:38.427 --> 07:39.543
Why this weekend?

07:39.558 --> 07:42.103
Because I want to spend time together and try and reconnect,

07:42.657 --> 07:44.453
away from distractions.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.713
well,what about next weekend?

07:47.725 --> 07:49.773
I could book that great hotel up in la jolla.

07:49.785 --> 07:52.790
It's got views,room service.

07:53.767 --> 07:54.742
mattress.

07:54.757 --> 07:56.333
I don't want to stay in a hotel.

07:57.325 --> 08:01.141
I want to drive up the coast,pitch a tent on the beach just like we used to.

08:01.728 --> 08:02.842
What about the kids?

08:02.856 --> 08:04.100
Check the diningoom.

08:09.186 --> 08:10.891
Kevin walker?

08:11.325 --> 08:14.651
We're turning uncle kevin into a lion!

08:14.667 --> 08:16.943
Yeah,and when the transformation is complete,

08:17.187 --> 08:19.480
I'm gonna eat you up.

08:23.748 --> 08:24.702
you're gonna babysit?

08:24.717 --> 08:25.631
Yep.

08:26.267 --> 08:29.280
Well,it looks like we're going camping.

08:30.016 --> 08:31.502
Looks like.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.462
it's not that I'm not grateful,

08:37.505 --> 08:39.253
'cause it's hard to part with cash.

08:39.267 --> 08:40.513
I don't care how much you have.

08:40.527 --> 08:41.792
stop squirming.

08:41.807 --> 08:42.981
I'm not squirming.

08:45.048 --> 08:46.551
Someone taught you how to do this,right?

08:47.228 --> 08:48.341
would you just relax?

08:48.355 --> 08:49.912
It's an innate talent.

08:49.928 --> 08:51.053
So no.

08:51.657 --> 08:52.973
All right,shush.

08:54.196 --> 08:55.861
Now don't move.

08:56.468 --> 08:58.190
Here we go.

09:01.035 --> 09:02.861
yeah,that fls good.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.291
All right,move your hands.

09:04.305 --> 09:05.461
Take a deep breath.

09:06.728 --> 09:11.222
okay,picture yourself somewhere really,really beautiful.

09:12.606 --> 09:13.802
like a beach.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.490
Just the sound of the waves.

09:17.117 --> 09:19.092
maybe a dolphin.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.723
maybe a margarita.

09:21.736 --> 09:22.563
what are you wearing?

09:22.575 --> 09:24.923
Oh,this is not that kind of massage.

09:24.936 --> 09:26.231
Well,that's disappointing.

09:32.346 --> 09:33.512
n-no no,no.

09:33.527 --> 09:34.470
Don't move.

09:34.487 --> 09:35.690
Keep your eyes closed.

09:35.707 --> 09:37.263
You're at the beach.

09:38.896 --> 09:42.112
the cell phone reception is great on this beach.

09:42.127 --> 09:43.181
fine.Don't move.

09:43.195 --> 09:44.143
I'm gonna get it.

09:44.155 --> 09:45.231
Thank you.

09:45.247 --> 09:46.122
Hello?

09:46.137 --> 09:46.961
Oh,yeah,yeah.

09:46.978 --> 09:48.231
Hey,gary,what's up?

09:49.108 --> 09:51.372
Oh,no,yeah,he-- he's here,but.

09:51.827 --> 09:53.542
what?

09:54.875 --> 09:56.322
Kitty.

09:58.438 --> 10:00.372
Oh,my god!

10:01.126 --> 10:02.241
Kitty,what happened?

10:02.255 --> 10:03.383
It's the.

10:03.706 --> 10:06.311
it's the campaign chopper.It crashed!

10:06.326 --> 10:07.102
Kitty,who was on the chopper?

10:07.117 --> 10:08.813
The pilot--the--and.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.183
a staffer-- oh,my god,it was sve.

10:11.198 --> 10:12.480
It was steve,the--the speechwriter.

10:12.496 --> 10:13.801
I know who he is.

10:14.257 --> 10:15.972
Oh,my god!

10:17.000 --> 10:23.074

10:25.746 --> 10:28.272
that is why men like.

10:28.857 --> 10:30.473
camping more than women.

10:30.487 --> 10:31.372
Oh,come oN.

10:31.386 --> 10:32.963
Peeing outside isn't that bad.

10:32.975 --> 10:35.111
Yeah,if you can whip it out and go,

10:35.126 --> 10:38.423
but for us ladies,we have to balance and squat.

10:38.808 --> 10:40.950
Well,this looks like you're making progress.

10:40.967 --> 10:44.332
Yeah,I'd be done by now if I had an assist.

10:44.348 --> 10:46.441
I can't believe you can remember how to do this.

10:46.458 --> 10:47.413
It's like ridin' a bike.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.561
Yeah,a smelly,old,musty bike.

10:50.278 --> 10:51.301
Okay.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.400
Good.

10:52.876 --> 10:55.952
And voila.

10:56.377 --> 10:58.693
Madam,we have a shelter.

10:58.705 --> 11:00.262
I'm impressed.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.041
Damn.

11:03.055 --> 11:05.433
We'll just,uh,improvise a support beam.

11:05.446 --> 11:07.571
Just have to look for A.

11:07.585 --> 11:09.102
twig or something.

11:09.117 --> 11:10.562
Maybe there's something over here.

11:11.906 --> 11:13.571
After I take a break.

11:15.885 --> 11:16.591
What are you doing?

11:16.607 --> 11:17.872
Going swimming!

11:17.888 --> 11:19.591
Joe,it's northern california.

11:19.607 --> 11:20.842
The water's freezing.

11:20.855 --> 11:21.743
So what?

11:21.757 --> 11:22.533
Come on!

11:22.546 --> 11:23.443
No,no,no,no.

11:23.457 --> 11:24.643
I didn't pack a suit.

11:24.657 --> 11:25.790
Yeah?

11:27.036 --> 11:28.432
Me neither!

11:29.105 --> 11:29.812
Joe,come on.

11:29.827 --> 11:30.973
What if someone sees?

11:30.988 --> 11:33.213
So what if some stranger gets aeek?

11:33.677 --> 11:36.593
We'll be embarrassed for all of,what,two seconds?

11:36.935 --> 11:38.003
Come on!

11:38.015 --> 11:39.940
Since when did you get so shy?

11:41.158 --> 11:43.613
You cannot goad me into skinny-dipping!

11:43.625 --> 11:45.133
Not trying to!

11:45.147 --> 11:47.472
I'm gonna cool off and have a swim,

11:47.486 --> 11:51.542
and you can just hang here in the heat,look for a twig!

11:51.555 --> 11:52.630
Are you really.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.203
Is it cold?

11:57.706 --> 12:01.192
It's ice-cold,and it's awesome!

12:11.896 --> 12:13.963
Tricky,paige,very tricky.

12:13.975 --> 12:15.822
Uncle kevin,can I ask you a question?

12:15.835 --> 12:17.860
How come I got all the good looks in the family?

12:18.486 --> 12:20.020
Why aren't you married?

12:23.128 --> 12:25.363
uh,well,paige,um,

12:26.538 --> 12:28.712
because gay people aren't allowed to get married.

12:28.726 --> 12:30.172
Well,not--not in this state,anyway.

12:30.187 --> 12:31.663
But that's not really fair.

12:31.677 --> 12:32.512
I agree.

12:32.525 --> 12:33.222
It's not fair.

12:33.237 --> 12:34.970
Is that why yodon't have a boyfriend,

12:34.987 --> 12:36.611
'cause you can't get married?

12:37.357 --> 12:38.341
No.

12:38.355 --> 12:41.252
Well,you know,I don't--I don't think I've met the rht guy yet.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.792
Plus,you know,I'm very young.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.622
I still have a lot of time left,

12:45.826 --> 12:49.403
and some people aren't relationship types,you know?

12:49.417 --> 12:52.481
Like,um,george clooney and.me.

12:52.497 --> 12:55.382
and,uh.

12:59.135 --> 13:00.440
george clooney.

13:01.647 --> 13:03.002
you know,your aunt kitty's much,

13:03.017 --> 13:05.093
much older than I am,and look at her.

13:05.676 --> 13:07.713
But she's dating the senator.

13:07.728 --> 13:10.172
I know,but that's all kind of new,and between you and me,

13:10.187 --> 13:11.831
I wouldn't count on that rking out.

13:15.696 --> 13:16.193
Coect four.

13:16.207 --> 13:17.680
What? Where?

13:18.538 --> 13:20.263
One,two,three,four.I win.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.300
What? W-what?

13:23.938 --> 13:26.042
Wait.Were you distracting me?

13:26.058 --> 13:27.163
That was a setup.

13:28.355 --> 13:29.863
Great strategy.

13:29.878 --> 13:31.732
Wait till you're old enough for game night.

13:34.456 --> 13:36.922
whatever they need,I want you to run it through my account.

13:37.365 --> 13:38.641
Okay?

13:39.205 --> 13:40.272
Of course.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.700
Thank you.

13:50.025 --> 13:52.093
Did u talk to the pilot's wife?

13:54.138 --> 13:56.072
And did you talk to steven's parents?

13:57.616 --> 13:59.553
They're in shock,I think.

14:00.745 --> 14:03.442
god,I have such a headache.

14:05.016 --> 14:08.401
I've tried rescheduling tomorrow's gala,but there's no way.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.183
That's fine.

14:09.197 --> 14:12.030
Is there,uh,anything else that we need to do that--

14:12.445 --> 14:13.980
that we haven't thought of?

14:14.588 --> 14:17.410
I just talked to gary.I told him I wanted to cover the expenses.

14:18.037 --> 14:19.923
Did you know steve had two sisters?

14:21.678 --> 14:22.723
No.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.442
He was their youngest.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.501
We need to figure out how you want to make your statement.

14:31.517 --> 14:33.463
I don't know if you want to do a press conference,

14:33.477 --> 14:35.721
or maybe you just want to sit down with somebody.

14:36.107 --> 14:38.041
I'm not gonna go on tv and talk about this.

14:39.995 --> 14:41.211
Robert,he was your speechwriter.

14:41.226 --> 14:43.180
But this isn't about politics.

14:43.448 --> 14:46.170
I'm not gonna exploit this kid's death to bolster my campaign.

14:46.188 --> 14:47.741
I'm not asking you to.

14:48.316 --> 14:50.860
But there are people on this campaign,people who work every day,

14:50.878 --> 14:52.371
who are devastated and grieving,

14:52.386 --> 14:53.800
and they need to know that you care.

14:53.817 --> 14:55.801
Why would anyone think otherwise?

14:57.378 --> 14:58.393
I'll release a statement in writing.

14:58.408 --> 15:00.720
No,robert,you have to do it on camera.

15:00.735 --> 15:02.013
And say what?

15:02.025 --> 15:03.652
That it doesn't make any sense?

15:03.668 --> 15:06.350
That it's awful and random and unjust?

15:06.745 --> 15:10.273
I mean,kitty,I could barely pay this kid a compliment when he was alive.

15:10.287 --> 15:13.213
I made his job endlessly frustrating,and I have to live with that.

15:13.228 --> 15:14.382
But then to go on camera--

15:14.395 --> 15:17.323
I'm sorry,but whatever crisis of conscience you are dealing with,

15:17.337 --> 15:19.632
you're gonna have to put it to the side for now.

15:19.645 --> 15:23.380
People are looking to you to show 'em how to react,and you--

15:23.767 --> 15:25.351
you owe 'em that.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.550
You owe steve that.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.412
All right,all set--

15:32.427 --> 15:36.071
shot given,teeth brushed,story read,kid asleep.

15:36.087 --> 15:38.391
Clearly,I am the better uncle,hands down.

15:38.407 --> 15:41.082
You didn't watch the wiggles and play connect four all night.

15:41.658 --> 15:42.933
So they really went away,huh?

15:42.945 --> 15:44.341
Yep.Joe planned it.

15:44.356 --> 15:45.730
Wanted time alone with sarah.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.250
What?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.103
Just when they come home,there might be some tension.

15:53.115 --> 15:55.473
Tension? It's a romantic getaway,isn't it?

15:56.178 --> 15:57.892
Justin,don't make me cross-examine you,okay?

15:57.907 --> 15:59.382
Those kids seriously wore me out.

15:59.395 --> 16:00.452
All right,look,if I tell you something,

16:00.467 --> 16:03.350
you have to promise not to say anything,like for real.

16:03.366 --> 16:05.571
Not tell someone and then tell them not to say anything.

16:05.588 --> 16:06.432
Okay,okay.

16:06.447 --> 16:07.813
Promise.

16:07.995 --> 16:10.213
Joe made a pass at rebecca.

16:11.658 --> 16:12.822
- What? 
- Yeah,I don't--I don't know.

16:12.838 --> 16:15.102
She went over to,like,borrow a guitar or something-- 

16:15.118 --> 16:16.670
justin,come on.That's insane,okay?

16:16.687 --> 16:18.793
Rebecca's family,and joe would never do that.

16:18.807 --> 16:19.431
You know what? He did.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.260
You know this for sure?

16:20.276 --> 16:21.721
Rebecca told me,and I believe her.

16:21.738 --> 16:25.150
And I told joe that-- that he had to tell sarah.

16:26.505 --> 16:27.472
Okay.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.453
So clearly you haven't noticed the problems they've been having.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.342
- What does that have to do with it? 
- Don't you think it might have been a misunderstanding?

16:34.357 --> 16:36.483
What if rebecca was exaggerating?

16:36.498 --> 16:37.843
This could ruin sarah's marriage!

16:37.858 --> 16:39.923
And sarah t knowing about it would help?

16:39.937 --> 16:40.750
You weren't there.How do you know?

16:40.766 --> 16:42.871
You only know what rebecca told you,and you barely know her.

16:42.888 --> 16:44.133
Why would she lie,kevin?

16:44.145 --> 16:46.302
Aw,justin,people lie all the time.

16:46.315 --> 16:48.242
Why do you think I stay away from family law?

16:48.927 --> 16:50.860
You should hear what people make up when they're angry.

16:50.878 --> 16:51.833
They will say anything.

16:52.088 --> 16:53.972
Half the time they don't even know they're telling lies

16:53.985 --> 16:56.103
'cause they warp the truth so much in their own minds!

16:56.115 --> 16:57.403
We don't need any more secretsokay?

16:57.415 --> 16:58.750
This is not about us.

16:58.766 --> 17:00.581
It's about sarah and her family.

17:01.577 --> 17:02.660
Wh about paige and cooper?

17:02.675 --> 17:05.540
Did you think about them when you gave joe your little ultimatum?

17:16.387 --> 17:18.359
I can't believe you got me to go skinny-dipping.

17:18.376 --> 17:20.422
I don't even remember the last time I did that.

17:20.715 --> 17:21.859
I do.

17:22.224 --> 17:24.131
You were six months pregnant with paige.

17:24.147 --> 17:25.829
Santa anas were out of control.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.041
It was hot as hell.

17:27.055 --> 17:28.371
Our A.C.Broke.

17:29.485 --> 17:31.181
We snuck into my parents' pool.

17:31.195 --> 17:32.603
At 2:00 in the morning.

17:32.615 --> 17:36.030
I thought your old man was gonna think we were intruders and shoot us.

17:36.048 --> 17:37.492
you.

17:38.465 --> 17:40.930
you,you just stripped down and dove in,

17:40.947 --> 17:43.240
and your belly was just getting all big and round.

17:43.257 --> 17:45.560
Oh,I must have been gorgeous.

17:46.905 --> 17:48.363
You were.

17:50.635 --> 17:52.482
Then and now.

17:54.817 --> 17:56.970
I remember sitting there watching you.

17:58.816 --> 18:02.631
and all I could think was,what did I do to deserve this woman?

18:04.317 --> 18:07.430
I can'imagine you've bee thinking that lately.

18:13.346 --> 18:14.871
Sarah.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.430
I need you to know.

18:22.346 --> 18:23.870
what?

18:25.638 --> 18:26.841
What,joe?

18:26.858 --> 18:28.671
Just.

18:29.027 --> 18:31.550
I need you to know that.

18:34.175 --> 18:38.843
I need you to know that I love you so much I can't even put it into words.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.740
Oh,joe.

18:42.987 --> 18:46.752
Listen,I am sorry if I've made you feel like everything's your fault.

18:46.765 --> 18:47.791
No,don't apologize.

18:47.808 --> 18:48.902
No,I need to.

18:48.916 --> 18:49.970
I owe you that.

18:49.985 --> 18:53.510
You know,with everything that's happened this year with my family,

18:53.528 --> 18:58.103
I didn't want to take it out on you,and I.

18:59.145 --> 19:00.771
I think I did.

19:03.238 --> 19:05.562
I really want us to work.

19:10.968 --> 19:12.432
So do I.

19:25.737 --> 19:26.820
ever had ethiopian food?

19:26.837 --> 19:29.033
No,but I'm not here for the food.

19:29.045 --> 19:31.581
Well,either way I won,because you're here.

19:31.855 --> 19:33.131
Relax.

19:33.145 --> 19:35.743
Take in these new aromas and these tastes.

19:35.757 --> 19:36.782
Just.

19:36.797 --> 19:38.152
be in the moment.

19:38.757 --> 19:40.083
There's no utensils.

19:40.098 --> 19:42.161
Injera--all you need.

19:42.176 --> 19:42.873
And no forks.

19:42.885 --> 19:44.402
You know,in american culture,

19:44.416 --> 19:47.740
our relationship to food is so sterile.

19:47.756 --> 19:53.410
It's a cold,futional interplay between a metallic implement and our mouths.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.973
In other cultures,it's like.

20:01.317 --> 20:02.970
- Good? 
- Excellent.

20:03.925 --> 20:04.793
Here.

20:04.805 --> 20:07.011
Oh,no.I am totally capable of feeding myself.

20:07.025 --> 20:08.373
It's giving gursha.

20:08.385 --> 20:12.673
In ethiopia,it's a tradition to feed friends and family.

20:12.687 --> 20:13.483
and students?

20:13.495 --> 20:16.861
And students,yes,with your hands.

20:16.878 --> 20:18.722
Come on,nora.

20:18.738 --> 20:20.461
Let your hair down.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.970
That is quite tasty.

20:27.068 --> 20:28.300
and hot.

20:28.627 --> 20:29.592
I should have warned you.

20:29.608 --> 20:30.560
I'm sorry.

20:30.575 --> 20:31.670
It's good for me.

20:33.368 --> 20:34.931
Spicy food,good for the digestion.

20:34.945 --> 20:36.673
Yep,and it's a stimulant.

20:37.068 --> 20:40.501
Well,oysters never worked on me,so don't get your hopes up.

20:40.515 --> 20:42.612
No,not that kind of stimulant.

20:42.895 --> 20:45.721
Hot food is a stimulant for the circulation.

20:45.738 --> 20:48.242
Ah,yes,the circulation.

20:48.255 --> 20:49.450
That's good,too.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.253
I'm glad you came by.

20:51.265 --> 20:52.773
I was so bored.

20:53.315 --> 20:54.660
Sorry,all we have is ginger ale.

20:54.675 --> 20:55.942
Thanks.

20:57.777 --> 21:00.830
Actually,I wanted to talk to you about what happened with joe.

21:01.847 --> 21:03.303
I already told you what happened.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.400
I know,but the thing is.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.690
I need to know more.

21:09.108 --> 21:10.702
Like exactly how-- 

21:10.718 --> 21:11.880
I thought we were dropping this.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.453
Yeah,but you don't know what's going on,all right?

21:13.466 --> 21:15.350
Sarah and joe have been married a long time,

21:15.755 --> 21:17.861
and they're not in a good place right now.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.220
So if what you're saying is true--

21:19.238 --> 21:20.641
 if?

21:20.847 --> 21:22.422
You think I'm lying?

21:22.945 --> 21:23.643
No,no.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.901
I didn't-- no,I didn't say that.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.522
You didn't have to.

21:27.718 --> 21:29.082
All right.Okay,fine,justin.

21:29.098 --> 21:30.993
You want to know what happened exactly?

21:31.008 --> 21:31.952
I'll tell you.

21:31.967 --> 21:34.863
I was sitting in my long-lost sister's house trying to be a part of a family 

21:34.876 --> 21:36.331
that I didn't even know that I had,

21:36.348 --> 21:38.321
and her lechy husband leans over and kisses me.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.770
Like,oh,hi,you must be the new family slut.

21:40.788 --> 21:41.842
That's how it happened,justin.

21:41.855 --> 21:43.012
He came on to me.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.503
I can't--I can't have this conversation.

21:47.518 --> 21:48.803
Um,you need to go.

21:48.817 --> 21:49.623
Rebecca,I'm sorry.

21:49.638 --> 21:50.911
I knew your family wouldn't believe me,

21:50.926 --> 21:52.260
but I thought that you would.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.490
I-I do believe you.

21:53.505 --> 21:54.851
No,you don'T.

21:59.808 --> 22:01.180
I'm sorry.

22:08.817 --> 22:11.083
what was that all about?

22:16.828 --> 22:19.170
This was wonderful,absolutely wonderful.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.170
You seem surprised at having had a good time.

22:22.478 --> 22:25.523
Well,the way you asked me out did leave a few things to be desired,

22:25.537 --> 22:27.330
but I guess I should have kept an open mind.

22:27.795 --> 22:28.871
Did you enjoy your meal?

22:28.885 --> 22:29.820
Yes,very much.

22:29.835 --> 22:30.971
As always.

22:30.986 --> 22:33.531
Let me guess-- two glasses of honey wine?

22:33.545 --> 22:34.243
No,no,no.

22:34.256 --> 22:35.910
Just-- just the check,thank you.

22:35.927 --> 22:37.720
Of course,mr.August.

22:39.777 --> 22:41.403
She knows you.How does she know you?

22:41.417 --> 22:42.860
I'm a frequent diner.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.192
How frequent?

22:44.207 --> 22:45.241
I'm a bachelor.

22:45.256 --> 22:46.563
There's nothing in my refrigerator.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.871
you bring all your first dates here,don't you?

22:52.355 --> 22:54.811
You're not the first woman I've ever brought here.

22:56.445 --> 22:58.621
oh,I am such an idiot.

22:58.978 --> 23:03.330
You are another charming,intelligent louse.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.502
This whole date is an act-- a well-orchestrated,

23:05.516 --> 23:07.081
well-rehearsed act-- 

23:07.525 --> 23:10.491
the romantic little table,the exotic setting.

23:10.716 --> 23:12.172
You pretend to be so open,

23:12.188 --> 23:15.011
and all of this is just your way of hiding behind your intellect,

23:15.027 --> 23:18.173
using someone else's culture to make you seem so worldly,

23:18.187 --> 23:19.523
so damn sexy.

23:19.535 --> 23:21.911
Have you ever even been to ethiopia?

23:23.007 --> 23:24.253
I didn't think so.

23:25.048 --> 23:30.832
I assume this has fulfilled my attendance requirements,professor august.

23:31.856 --> 23:33.323
Good night.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.191
Justin,it's joe.

23:41.388 --> 23:43.053
I need you to hear me out.

23:45.026 --> 23:46.591
It was a mistake,

23:47.248 --> 23:49.342
and I swear it will never happen again.

23:50.456 --> 23:54.250
But this weekend,it reminded me how much I love your sister,

23:54.266 --> 23:56.732
and she loves me,too,and,uh,

23:57.725 --> 23:59.220
I can't lose her.

24:01.038 --> 24:03.033
So if you want her to know,

24:04.046 --> 24:06.051
then you're gonna have to tell her yourself.

24:06.325 --> 24:11.522
joe,coop wants you to read where the wild things are with the scary voices.

24:11.537 --> 24:12.913
I'll be right up.

24:14.948 --> 24:16.220
Justin?

24:17.425 --> 24:18.811
Yeah.

24:19.668 --> 24:20.441
Look,don't worry.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.310
I won't-- I won't say anything to her.

24:25.168 --> 24:26.611
Thank you.

24:28.557 --> 24:29.821
Good-bye.

24:40.327 --> 24:41.571
Holly.

24:43.205 --> 24:46.033
To what do I owe this unpleasant surprise?

24:46.418 --> 24:48.382
We need to talk.

24:51.187 --> 24:57.801
I thought the perk of you and tommy starting the winery was that we no longer needed to talk.

24:58.928 --> 25:00.592
This is about rebecca.

25:01.816 --> 25:02.922
Is she okay?

25:02.935 --> 25:04.402
No,she's not.

25:04.756 --> 25:08.831
She is upset and confused,not to mention mortified.

25:08.846 --> 25:10.092
I'm sorry.What's-- 

25:10.107 --> 25:13.040
you do know that your husband made a pass at her?

25:15.378 --> 25:18.631
I'm sorry,holly,not even you can ruin my mood today.

25:18.646 --> 25:21.092
He didn't tell you that he kissed her?

25:21.358 --> 25:23.193
Well,believe me,he did.

25:23.837 --> 25:28.073
I make it a policy never to believe a word that comes out of your mouth.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.592
Then ask joe.

25:30.606 --> 25:33.780
I'm not gonna dignify your ridiculous accusations by asking joe anything.

25:33.797 --> 25:35.741
She is 20 years old.

25:35.756 --> 25:38.731
He took advantage of her trust and her insecurity.

25:38.748 --> 25:40.040
Look,I get it,holly.

25:40.056 --> 25:43.162
You're upset that rebecca's spending time with my family.

25:43.178 --> 25:47.511
So in some feeble attempt at payback,you're trying to ruin my marriage.

25:47.527 --> 25:49.610
Well,you know,it's not gonna work.

25:49.625 --> 25:52.972
Yeah,well,from what I understand,your marriage is already in shambles,

25:53.275 --> 25:54.900
and honestly,I could care less.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.592
What I do care about is my daughter,

25:58.066 --> 26:01.100
and while your kids were at school and you were at work,

26:01.366 --> 26:05.823
your husband generously offered to teach her the guitar.

26:10.048 --> 26:12.151
Did I hit a nerve?

26:12.506 --> 26:15.362
Is that scenario familiar?

26:15.637 --> 26:17.311
Get out of my office.

26:17.585 --> 26:21.980
So this isn't the first time that music lessons led to something-- 

26:21.997 --> 26:23.630
I said get out.

26:25.035 --> 26:28.311
Keep your washed-up husband away from my little girl.

26:35.255 --> 26:40.161
as you all know,our campaign suffered a terrible loss in the helicopter crash two nights ago.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.903
Along with the pilot paul sanderson,

26:44.426 --> 26:47.692
we lost steven cohen,one of our junior speechwriters.

26:49.275 --> 26:54.480
I have been trying ever since the accident to come to some sort of terms with their deaths.

26:55.307 --> 26:59.872
They were sudden,tragic and premature.

26:59.887 --> 27:03.310
And they call to mind the losses that so many of us are experiencing,

27:03.326 --> 27:05.072
because in a time of war,

27:05.585 --> 27:08.041
grief is not something shared by the few.

27:08.568 --> 27:10.102
It's shared by the many.

27:11.716 --> 27:15.652
Now that may sound like a cliche,but steve knew it wasn'T.

27:16.316 --> 27:20.673
He came on to this campaign right out of college and from his very first day,

27:20.687 --> 27:26.821
dedicated himself to our cause as a tireless and talented writer.

27:32.735 --> 27:35.190
He had the courage of his convictions,

27:36.648 --> 27:40.482
and like a lot of young people,he was an unabashed idealist.

27:41.426 --> 27:45.632
Sometimes on the campaign trail,it's easy to forget those ideals.

27:46.815 --> 27:51.131
But while others cloak themselves in cynicism or give in to apathy,

27:51.146 --> 27:53.482
we must be unafraid to hope.

27:54.058 --> 27:58.970
Hope is the simplest of words,and the hardest thing to have in politics.

27:59.225 --> 28:01.991
And yet it is the vy foundation of democracy-- 

28:02.268 --> 28:04.191
the hope of making a better country,

28:04.617 --> 28:09.420
a better world,and not just for some of us,for everne.

28:12.326 --> 28:14.431
Those are steve cohen's words.

28:17.018 --> 28:20.822
Right before he died,I gave him a very hard time about this very passage.

28:22.075 --> 28:26.730
To say that that was a mistake is an understatement.

28:27.886 --> 28:29.582
I'm sorry,steve.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.872
That's all for today.

28:42.077 --> 28:43.512
You're home from wk early.

28:43.936 --> 28:46.723
I got a head start on dinner.

28:56.358 --> 28:57.720
Joe?

28:58.507 --> 29:00.502
Did you kiss rebecca?

29:06.357 --> 29:08.271
Joe?

29:09.285 --> 29:11.211
It's not what you think,sarah.

29:11.225 --> 29:15.432
It's stupid,inexcusable,and the second it happened,I stopped.

29:15.446 --> 29:17.042
I don't even know hoit started.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.602
Is that what this weekend was about?

29:18.618 --> 29:19.583
I wanted to tell you.

29:19.595 --> 29:21.912
I was going to.I meant to.

29:21.927 --> 29:26.693
You dragged me to the middle of nowhere to tell me that you made out with my sister?

29:26.947 --> 29:29.752
What were you afraid of,that I might yell or--

29:29.766 --> 29:32.151
or break things or,god forbid,cry?

29:32.167 --> 29:33.093
No,no.

29:33.107 --> 29:34.602
I.

29:34.616 --> 29:36.441
I thought if we could just get away.

29:36.698 --> 29:37.812
Be alone.

29:38.638 --> 29:40.021
I feel awful that it happened,

29:40.035 --> 29:41.940
and,sarah,please-- 

29:41.956 --> 29:43.373
please what?

29:44.768 --> 29:46.841
What,joe? I thought I was going crazy,

29:46.855 --> 29:50.233
that me worrying about your fidelitwas just--

29:50.245 --> 29:51.772
just me being paranoid.

29:51.787 --> 29:54.511
But I have to hear about it from holly?

29:55.146 --> 29:56.773
Yeah,she was thrilled.

29:57.305 --> 29:59.360
rubbing your indiscretion in my face.

29:59.378 --> 30:02.140
Do you have any idea how humiliating this is?

30:02.155 --> 30:03.113
Oh,right.

30:03.127 --> 30:03.992
Stupid me.

30:04.707 --> 30:06.321
Here I was thinking this had something to do with us,

30:06.336 --> 30:10.083
when really it's just who has the upper hand in this ridiculous family feud you've got going on.

30:10.097 --> 30:11.073
Oh,I'm sorry,joe.

30:11.086 --> 30:12.111
Did I hurt your feelings?

30:12.126 --> 30:16.860
Then tell me,please,what the appropriate response to you making out with my sister is.

30:16.878 --> 30:18.240
What is the pot? You don't want to hear me.

30:18.256 --> 30:20.501
You're pfectly content being righteous and angry.

30:20.516 --> 30:23.391
Angry? Damn right,I am angry!

30:24.195 --> 30:25.451
I'm angry at you,joe!

30:25.467 --> 30:27.410
What have you become?

30:29.536 --> 30:31.713
I don'T.I don't recognize you.

30:31.726 --> 30:32.532
Do you want to know why?

30:32.548 --> 30:33.293
Why?

30:33.308 --> 30:35.742
Because I'm stuck in this life that you wanted.

30:35.757 --> 30:36.532
Oh,god.

30:36.546 --> 30:40.111
This--it's a suburban little world complete with two little kids and a picket fence.

30:40.126 --> 30:42.422
You want me to apologize for our kids?

30:42.435 --> 30:43.483
Screw you.

30:43.496 --> 30:45.931
You know how much I love those kids.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.791
But when we talked about starting a family,

30:47.807 --> 30:49.090
you said nothing would change.

30:49.106 --> 30:50.543
Yeah,I don't even know what to do with that.

30:50.555 --> 30:52.251
Just don't pretend you didn't see it.

30:52.266 --> 30:53.502
What,joe? See what?

30:53.515 --> 30:56.481
Every decision--to have this home,to have the kids,

30:56.496 --> 30:59.181
to go to work--they were choices that you made,

30:59.198 --> 31:01.400
and I went along with them because I want to make you happy.

31:01.418 --> 31:02.063
Great,great.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.030
Now I get the big martyr speech.

31:04.045 --> 31:06.142
- Joe,you don't get to be the victim. 
- There's the typical sarah,

31:06.157 --> 31:08.243
- you're the one who did something wrong,you! 
- belittling everything I say.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.301
Treating me like I am less than-- then nothing has changed,

31:09.316 --> 31:10.572
because as far as you're concerned,

31:10.587 --> 31:12.572
I don't do anything right!

31:12.587 --> 31:14.571
So it's all my fault.

31:15.068 --> 31:17.272
I drove you to seek out other women.

31:17.288 --> 31:22.101
At least other women,they don't look at me like I am some insignificant burden,

31:22.116 --> 31:24.673
like I'm not worthy of being with you.

31:24.687 --> 31:26.831
Of course,that's why you moved on from vanessa to rebecca--

31:26.846 --> 31:29.141
because she's naive enough to look at you,joe,

31:29.157 --> 31:32.933
and see this good-looking older guy instead of a failed musician with

31:32.946 --> 31:37.120
two failed marriages under his belt and three kids he can't support.

31:40.395 --> 31:41.913
What are we even fighting for?

31:41.927 --> 31:43.823
Do you even want to be with me?

31:44.615 --> 31:47.260
Or is this a convenient excuse so that you can call noah?

31:47.825 --> 31:50.212
I never acted on my feelings with noah.

31:50.228 --> 31:53.201
But you wanted to for months,for years even.

31:53.606 --> 31:55.523
So just tell me,sarah.

31:57.036 --> 31:58.371
what is the big difference?

31:58.385 --> 32:00.562
There is a huge difference.

32:02.246 --> 32:04.263
Did you fantasize about him?

32:05.595 --> 32:07.180
While we were making love,

32:07.385 --> 32:09.840
did you wish that you were with noah?

32:11.148 --> 32:12.691
Yes.

32:13.605 --> 32:15.030
All the time.

32:17.157 --> 32:18.971
Is that what you want to hear?

32:18.985 --> 32:20.642
At least now we're being honest with each other.

32:20.657 --> 32:24.253
You're the one that doesn't have the guts to face the truth about yourself.

32:24.857 --> 32:25.803
You know what?

32:25.818 --> 32:27.072
I'm leaving.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.341
That's it?

32:28.357 --> 32:30.250
You're just gonna walk out the door?

32:41.457 --> 32:43.743
Why couldn't you just trust me to handle it?

32:43.756 --> 32:46.581
Because it is not your responsibility to handle it.

32:46.596 --> 32:50.793
I can't have you over there wondering if some man twice your age is trying to corner you.

32:50.806 --> 32:52.781
Oh,don't you--don't you make this about me,mom.

32:52.796 --> 32:56.801
You've been waiting for a chance to get back at sarah for telling me the truth about my father,and you found it.

32:56.816 --> 32:57.920
That is not true.

32:57.937 --> 32:58.890
Oh,isn't it?

32:58.907 --> 33:00.670
They hate you,and you want them to hate me,too.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.160
I have been very accepting of your relationship--

33:02.176 --> 33:04.261
only because after lying to me my whole life,

33:04.276 --> 33:05.882
you didn't have a leg to stand on.

33:05.898 --> 33:06.992
Listen to me.

33:07.567 --> 33:10.663
I have had a front-row seat to that family for years.

33:10.677 --> 33:13.750
I know what it feels like to be an outsider,

33:13.768 --> 33:16.032
how enticing they can be.

33:16.707 --> 33:19.052
But whatever you think you want from them,

33:19.068 --> 33:23.131
trust me,you are not going to get it this way.

33:24.957 --> 33:26.862
Excuse me?

33:28.626 --> 33:30.301
I know you,rebecca,

33:30.817 --> 33:36.590
and I am guessing that joe did not just come on to you out of the blue.

33:38.135 --> 33:39.463
Just because you're a whore,

33:39.475 --> 33:41.133
it doesn't mean that I am.

33:42.227 --> 33:43.852
Stop it!

33:45.458 --> 33:47.662
No wonder he chose nora instead of you.

33:51.628 --> 33:55.541
I just called to tell you that your grade has been officially changed.

33:55.558 --> 33:56.790
Thank you.

33:58.207 --> 33:59.033
Is there anything else?

33:59.047 --> 34:00.473
Actually,there is.

34:00.836 --> 34:06.652
Nora,I think that I didn't quite fully understand how insightful you are.

34:07.657 --> 34:09.420
about people.

34:10.397 --> 34:12.591
Is this your way of saying I wasn't wrong about you?

34:13.205 --> 34:14.562
I guess.

34:17.257 --> 34:18.632
Yes.

34:18.647 --> 34:23.641
You know,and I find it utterly disconcerting and completely engagg.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.803
I know you have every reason to say no,but.

34:27.916 --> 34:32.801
would--would you give me the opportunity to try to make it up to you?

34:35.467 --> 34:36.831
well.

34:37.536 --> 34:38.693
maybe.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.719
But this time,I get to choose the restaurant.

34:41.556 --> 34:42.762
Of course.

34:44.455 --> 34:45.960
actually,there's somebody at my door.

34:45.978 --> 34:46.860
Okay.

34:46.875 --> 34:50.902
Just call me with the time and place,and I'll be there.

34:50.918 --> 34:51.882
All right.

34:51.898 --> 34:53.091
I will.

34:53.737 --> 34:55.159
Good-bye.

35:01.875 --> 35:05.093
rebecca,sweetheart,are you all right?

35:05.107 --> 35:06.551
Yeah,I'm fine.

35:07.187 --> 35:08.532
Um,is justin here?

35:08.545 --> 35:09.793
Yes.Yes,he's inside.

35:09.806 --> 35:11.132
Come on in.

35:13.988 --> 35:18.763
doing,like,a guitar lesson kind of thing with joe,just,you know.

35:18.975 --> 35:20.413
Does sarah know about this?

35:20.428 --> 35:21.870
My mother told her.

35:22.908 --> 35:24.272
Holly told her?

35:24.288 --> 35:26.070
God,I'm so sorry.

35:26.437 --> 35:28.541
I'm sorry.I didn't mean to come over here like this.

35:28.555 --> 35:31.293
I just--I didn't--I didn't know where else to go.

35:32.268 --> 35:33.530
No.

35:34.588 --> 35:35.983
Rebecca,I'm sorry.

35:35.996 --> 35:37.630
I'm sorry this has happened to you.

35:37.648 --> 35:39.053
I'm so sorry.

35:39.986 --> 35:42.223
Thank you for being so nice.

35:42.238 --> 35:44.381
See,I told you she'd understand.

35:46.636 --> 35:49.373
Do you think that maybe she can stay here,like,for a couple days,

35:49.385 --> 35:52.010
just while--while things,like,sort of calm down?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.863
do you want to do that?

35:59.878 --> 36:01.152
That's--that's okay,mrs.Walker.

36:01.165 --> 36:03.142
I have a lot of friends that I can stay with.Is fine.

36:03.497 --> 36:04.623
no.

36:04.635 --> 36:05.853
Rebecca.

36:06.268 --> 36:07.361
you're welcome here.

36:07.378 --> 36:08.673
You're family.

36:08.686 --> 36:10.251
I'm not.

36:10.547 --> 36:11.990
are you sure?

36:12.575 --> 36:15.063
Justin,just show her the spare room,okay?

36:19.185 --> 36:20.470
Well,where are you going?

36:20.937 --> 36:22.490
I want to call sarah.

36:36.015 --> 36:37.242
What are you doing out here?

36:37.258 --> 36:38.901
The people with the checkbooks are inside.

36:40.955 --> 36:42.833
I just needed some air.

36:44.715 --> 36:45.841
Are you okay?

36:48.076 --> 36:51.801
Yeah,I was just thinking about things,that's all.

36:52.948 --> 36:57.290
I've been,uh,thinking about what you said up there on the podium,

36:58.057 --> 37:03.533
about finding something to believe in and not letting yourself get cynical,

37:03.547 --> 37:06.072
and I ink that i let myself get cynical.

37:06.818 --> 37:08.873
No,the whole reason I hired you is that you're not cynical.

37:08.887 --> 37:10.490
No,I'm not talking about my politics.

37:10.506 --> 37:12.061
I'm talking about love.

37:15.518 --> 37:18.202
It could have been us in that helicopter.

37:19.227 --> 37:23.342
and when I think about that,and I think about all the things that I still want--

37:23.358 --> 37:24.641
kitty,what are you afraid of?

37:24.657 --> 37:26.011
Well,that's the thing.

37:26.865 --> 37:30.040
See,that's the weird thing is that I'm not afraid.

37:31.077 --> 37:32.631
I love you.

37:33.887 --> 37:35.351
And no matter how I think about it,

37:35.365 --> 37:38.733
I can't picture myself not loving you,

37:38.747 --> 37:43.012
and I think that what we have not only feels good,but it.

37:44.698 --> 37:46.532
it feels right.

37:47.078 --> 37:48.062
It is right.

37:48.077 --> 37:49.571
I-I don't know.Maybe it's the crash,

37:49.586 --> 37:54.743
or maybe it's that I'm finally at an age where something really good feels really perfect,

37:54.758 --> 37:57.602
but I don't think that I'm being overly sentimental.

37:57.777 --> 37:58.993
- You're not. 
- Just--you know,it really--

37:59.006 --> 38:00.540
it makes me wonder.

38:01.725 --> 38:06.581
It makes me wonder that if you love me the same way and being together makes us so happy,

38:06.598 --> 38:08.512
then what the hell are we waiting for?

38:11.675 --> 38:13.213
What are we waiting for?

38:13.827 --> 38:15.050
Do you want to move in?

38:15.067 --> 38:16.950
Will you marry me?

38:23.295 --> 38:25.883
Oh,my god!

38:26.575 --> 38:28.791
No.No,no,no.I didn'T.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.131
Did I just say-- yes,I did.

38:30.146 --> 38:32.081
Yes,-- I-- I just proposed to you.

38:32.098 --> 38:33.882
- I think that you just did.  
- I did.

38:33.897 --> 38:37.462
Now,kitty,I'm not thworld's biggest traditionalist,

38:37.477 --> 38:38.362
but where the hell is the ring?

38:38.377 --> 38:39.883
Oh,god,I'm sorry.

38:40.618 --> 38:42.993
I'm sorry.I didn't plan on saying that.

38:43.008 --> 38:45.671
If I had planned on saying that,I would have never said it.

38:45.947 --> 38:49.212
No,I-I'm just hoping that I can at least give it some thought.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.123
Oh,yeah.Yeah,of course,you can think about it.

38:51.137 --> 38:52.091
Think about it for a month.

38:52.106 --> 38:53.260
Think about it for a year.

38:53.278 --> 38:54.762
It was a joke.

38:56.626 --> 38:59.280
it's just.you know.

38:59.298 --> 39:00.180
Yeah,I know,you know.

39:00.195 --> 39:01.270
You ow what? I'm gonna throw up.

39:01.288 --> 39:02.621
I gotta go.

39:13.235 --> 39:14.430
Are the kids in bed?

39:14.448 --> 39:15.731
Yeah.

39:18.506 --> 39:21.791
I apologize for storming out earlier.

39:23.217 --> 39:24.610
Thank you.

39:26.756 --> 39:28.292
So what now?

39:30.687 --> 39:31.853
I don't know.

39:31.867 --> 39:33.453
I don't know either.

39:39.735 --> 39:41.273
My mother again.

39:42.557 --> 39:44.743
she's called four times.

39:47.395 --> 39:50.171
So the entire walker clan knows now?

39:51.058 --> 39:52.693
I don't know.Maybe.

39:54.307 --> 39:55.340
probably.

39:55.355 --> 39:57.283
Listen,I'm really tired.

39:57.955 --> 39:58.773
I'm gonna go to sleep.

39:58.785 --> 40:01.353
Do you mind sleeping in the spare room tonight?

40:03.555 --> 40:05.100
I was planning on it.

40:16.325 --> 40:17.961
you just show 'em your f minor 9th.

40:17.975 --> 40:19.480
wait,which one is that?

40:19.968 --> 40:21.291
That is.

40:21.665 --> 40:22.961
I thought this was cheating.

40:22.977 --> 40:23.942
Oh,yeah,it is.

40:23.957 --> 40:27.211
But there are only six people on the planet who know how to play this chord,

40:27.228 --> 40:32.063
and lucky for you,I am one of them.

40:32.075 --> 40:33.460
All right.

40:36.197 --> 40:37.361
You're a natural.

40:37.878 --> 40:39.683
Or maybe you're just a really good teacher.

40:40.255 --> 40:41.353
maybe.

40:43.156 --> 40:45.222
Wow,you have really good hands.

40:46.285 --> 40:48.922
strong and soft at the same time.

41:24.276 --> 41:25.380
I am so sorry.

41:25.398 --> 41:26.771
I didn't mean to--I-- 

41:27.617 --> 41:29.440
I don't even know why I.

41:33.697 --> 41:35.453
you should go.

41:37.515 --> 41:39.552
I don't have to.

41:41.617 --> 41:43.022
Yes.

41:45.247 --> 41:46.931
yes,you do.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.963
Well,thanks for the guitar.

42:04.416 --> 42:05.901
and the lesson.
