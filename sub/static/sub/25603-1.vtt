00:06.960 --> 00:08.620
Previously on Wynonna Earp...

00:10.460 --> 00:12.490
- Bulshar.
- My husband's true name.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.940
Waverly! It's coming!

00:14.020 --> 00:15.419
Please don't hurt us.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.399
And don't ever cross a mother!

00:19.570 --> 00:21.080
Did you give our daughter a name?

00:21.100 --> 00:22.540
Her first name is Alice.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.510
No one said parenthood was easy.

00:24.570 --> 00:26.040
It's time to grow up.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.899
Fine. You were right.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.040
Bulshar's back.

00:33.140 --> 00:34.620
Now what do we do about it?

00:35.380 --> 00:36.380
Mama?

00:39.360 --> 00:42.320
I can't believe we're
back here, of all places.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.190
She knows what she's doing in there.

00:44.890 --> 00:45.890
Right?

00:46.380 --> 00:49.220
Ever since her and Doc gave
the baby up, she's been...

00:49.260 --> 00:51.670
- Determined.
- Relentless.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.700
I've never seen her so... focused.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.770
Yeah, she's probably... fine.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.940
- And drunk.
- So drunk.

01:01.610 --> 01:04.550
C'mon, Wynonna. Don't Earp this up.

01:28.260 --> 01:31.510
That's how you Earp it, girls and boys!

01:32.440 --> 01:34.040
One sec.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.810
You don't even like the Dragunov.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.710
You said it lacks "grace."

01:38.000 --> 01:39.239
I don't need grace.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.740
I need steely Soviet precision.

01:52.310 --> 01:54.380
I believe I had a beer?!

01:54.450 --> 01:57.350
Yeah, a beer's not the
only thing you're missing.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.020
Right?

01:59.021 --> 02:01.340
She's completely lost her baby boobs.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.580
What?

02:04.190 --> 02:06.420
You know, I'm taking the night off!

02:06.490 --> 02:08.259
Don't you clowns ever
take the night off?

02:08.330 --> 02:11.400
Oh, I get it. You've had a
rough year, eh, Wynonna?

02:11.460 --> 02:13.840
- Shut up.
- I heard it died.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.270
I said, shut your dirty revenant mouth.

02:16.340 --> 02:19.240
All it took to break the heir
was a frickin' pregnancy.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.450
Well, I'm not pregnant anymore.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.570
Come on.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.270
- Yah!
- Ah!

02:53.410 --> 02:55.610
- Hey, you got a runner.
- I also got a gun.

02:55.670 --> 02:56.670
Yeah.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.799
Ah!

03:01.800 --> 03:02.879
Whoa!

03:04.580 --> 03:07.080
Was that the Dragunov?! Nice.

03:07.150 --> 03:09.450
Yeah, "Soviet precision"?
You barely grazed him.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.620
Wow. So competitive.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.590
So cocky.

03:15.090 --> 03:16.780
Yo, PDA! Focus!

03:22.030 --> 03:24.340
Welcome to the Dolls' house. Population?

03:24.400 --> 03:26.540
Your spine.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.050
Oh!

03:34.110 --> 03:36.520
- Boom!
- Gonna make you eat that.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.250
- Oh, crap.
- How rude.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.119
He's a vegetarian.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.689
Well, we did it!

03:42.690 --> 03:43.960
She did it.

03:44.860 --> 03:48.420
I'd ask about Bulshar
and where he is, but...

03:48.820 --> 03:50.060
Get bent.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.530
Get dead.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.500
I'm starting to think these

03:56.520 --> 03:58.530
revenants don't know where Bulshar is.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.570
We'll find him. We have to.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.640
Boys, we've got the Ghost
River Triangle under control.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.550
Stupid Pussy Willows!

04:18.800 --> 04:20.559
Lonnie, you been holdin' that radar gun

04:20.560 --> 04:21.829
in your lap all night?

04:22.360 --> 04:24.980
- Uh...
- Boy, did you wanna have a family someday?

04:26.470 --> 04:27.580
Oh.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.000
Hold that thought, son.
We got a live one.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.170
We... we didn't even clock 'em.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.470
Heads up.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.820
JÃ³ reggelt.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.720
Is this the Ghost River Triangle?

04:55.290 --> 04:57.830
Well, I suppose that would
depend on who's asking.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.260
Your master.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.370
Aren't you going to invite us in?

05:07.510 --> 05:09.010
Of course, Masters.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.080
Come on in.

05:19.350 --> 05:22.350
It's about time we had
some vampires up in here.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.730
Oh, buck up, Lonnie. You're
gonna miss the party.

- Mm.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.130
Morning, bonus blankets.

06:01.190 --> 06:02.490
Mm...

06:02.560 --> 06:04.100
Sleep okay?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.139
Yeah.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.699
Though I had the weirdest
dream that you were married.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.299
Really? 'Cause I had
a really weird dream

06:11.300 --> 06:12.499
that you were making out with a

06:12.500 --> 06:14.439
hot revenant in a hot tub.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.970
Well, that sounds like a nightmare.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.310
It really was a nightmare.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.150
You know... the fighting with you.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.720
Yeah, but...

06:25.780 --> 06:28.750
the making-up part...

06:28.820 --> 06:30.790
- Yeah, I know, uh...
- It's...

06:30.860 --> 06:32.390
it's pretty good.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.720
Wait. I... One sec.

06:40.820 --> 06:42.070
- No.
- One second.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.200
Mm. No. Please, no.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.370
No.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.980
The barn door's open.

06:53.050 --> 06:55.180
Was... was she out there all night?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.780
Oh, God. Again?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.790
Hey. Go.

07:13.630 --> 07:14.830
Ahem.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.040
Hey, Sheriff.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.870
What?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.340
- Hit me!
- I have been.

07:26.310 --> 07:27.899
You fight like you're 180 years old.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.050
I'm 166.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.290
Then move like it, Grandma.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.670
There you are.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.470
That's it?

07:56.210 --> 07:59.140
No sarsaparilla-soaked
clapback about my form?

07:59.460 --> 08:00.879
My form that I worked my ass off

08:00.880 --> 08:01.980
getting back into shape.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.550
You look great.

08:07.490 --> 08:09.690
Almost like it never happened at all.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.230
Tsk. Have you two been at it all night?!

08:18.400 --> 08:19.700
Tr-training, all night?

08:21.830 --> 08:23.230
This is not healthy.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.460
Even superheroes need sleep.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.059
I doubt Bulshar's out there

08:28.060 --> 08:29.569
tucked up in his jammies, so...

08:29.570 --> 08:32.320
I think we haven't seen
hide nor hair of him for...

08:32.380 --> 08:33.679
four months?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.140
Nineteen weeks.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.119
It's been 19 weeks.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.620
I have to go open up the bar.

08:42.780 --> 08:43.880
Earps.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.430
You okay?

08:54.320 --> 08:55.930
Bruised in all the right places.

08:57.140 --> 08:58.500
That bad, huh?

08:59.370 --> 09:01.000
He won't touch me unless we're training.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.010
And he won't talk to
me unless he's angry.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.080
So I keep him training and angry.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.680
Doc just needs time.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.690
It's the one thing I
don't think we have.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.200
Breaking this knob-gobbling
curse will help too.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.400
So we keep looking for Bulshar and

09:26.460 --> 09:27.920
keep sending revenants back to hell.

09:27.970 --> 09:30.600
- What else can we do, right?
- Keep the faith...

09:31.400 --> 09:32.770
... about Doc.

09:33.910 --> 09:35.610
He loves you, Wynonna.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.310
We all do.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.460
Hey, uh... sorry to interrupt.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.780
Right? That's my move.

09:45.650 --> 09:47.099
Is it a Black Badge case?

09:47.100 --> 09:48.589
Uh, no more Black Badge.

09:48.590 --> 09:51.360
- Is it an "us" case?
- I'd say it's all hands on deck.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.390
Okay. Uh...

09:53.990 --> 09:55.160
We'll follow you there.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.870
And... we're back at the Pussy.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.610
God, can't remember the
last time I was in here.

10:09.670 --> 10:12.180
- Right?
- We were here last night.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.450
I thought that vomit smelled familiar.

10:15.450 --> 10:17.750
You know, Mama used to love this place,

10:17.820 --> 10:20.180
back when it was The County Line Saloon.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.960
I used to wonder whether she'd left us

10:21.980 --> 10:23.839
to tour the rodeo circuit full-time

10:23.840 --> 10:26.060
with her magical Pegasus, Jellybean.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.120
Jellybean?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.260
Jesusbean!

10:29.330 --> 10:31.039
Wynonna.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.629
- Waverly.
- Hi.

10:32.630 --> 10:35.630
What the hell, Nedley? If
you're going for creepy,

10:35.640 --> 10:37.470
that neckerchief takes
it to the next level.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.519
It's European. Do you like it?

10:39.520 --> 10:40.869
I'm trying to make a good impression.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.870
On who? Mr. Darcy?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.499
Pride and Prejudice?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.050
Flouncy Netherfield ball?

10:47.100 --> 10:48.960
It's more of a disco.

10:49.030 --> 10:51.000
You don't want to be here.
You shouldn't be here.

10:51.070 --> 10:52.600
Why? What's happened?

10:56.570 --> 10:58.300
Well, whatever it is, we'll deal.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.679
Unless it's an army of Jason Momoas

11:00.680 --> 11:02.340
that have been cloned.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.610
I will handle that solo.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.279
She's such a giver.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.080
Hope Aquaman is, too.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.200
Nicole's already inside.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.700
You'll see.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.350
And, girls, I promise ya...

11:14.220 --> 11:15.790
... they didn't do this.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.490
Okay... Good to know.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.030
What's up with him? Who's "they"?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.570
The 'shrooms I've been slipping into

11:25.600 --> 11:27.260
his coffee have finally kicked in?

11:27.740 --> 11:29.219
C'mon, Emily Bronte.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.220
It's Jane Austen.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.180
There are more bodies outside.

11:34.680 --> 11:37.340
- This is new.
- Really new.

11:37.810 --> 11:39.580
We were just here.

11:39.950 --> 11:43.620
Almost like... it's a
message, wouldn't you say?

11:45.250 --> 11:48.360
As far as we can tell, they
all died simultaneously.

11:49.590 --> 11:52.060
Stabbed by some sort of serrated blade.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.730
Do you think...

11:55.360 --> 11:56.599
... they were possessed?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.600
Like, they did it to themselves?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.220
Then where's the murder weapon?

12:01.600 --> 12:04.540
And who arranged the bodies afterwards?

12:04.610 --> 12:05.840
Arranged?

12:08.510 --> 12:10.599
They've been displayed...

12:10.600 --> 12:12.600
very deliberately.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.250
In a pattern.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.159
God.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.500
Even for Purgatory, this is bad.

12:20.290 --> 12:22.100
Guys, I've never seen
anything like this.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.290
I have.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.679
Black Badge division's been tracking

12:28.680 --> 12:31.020
these massacres since the 1920s.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.130
Massacres?

12:35.440 --> 12:37.300
They call it the Cult of Bulshar.

12:42.310 --> 12:44.900
Anyone else up for more vomiting?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.340
Sixteen in total?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.370
All employees?

12:54.440 --> 12:58.150
And some vagrants in the
alley and some customers.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.360
But we think it happened
just before opening.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.220
Hold up. How long have you been working

13:02.240 --> 13:03.679
with Black Badge on this?

13:03.680 --> 13:05.250
Okay, it's not like that.

13:07.690 --> 13:10.720
When I first heard the
name... Bulshar...

13:10.890 --> 13:12.439
wh-when Faux Mercedes said it

13:12.440 --> 13:13.659
right before you shot the widows...

13:13.660 --> 13:16.430
- Yeah, I did...
- ... it twigged something in me.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.280
It's like I'd heard it before.
So... I asked Dolls,

13:20.300 --> 13:23.230
and he gave me some old BBD files.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.140
- Dolls?
- Yeah.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.470
Agent Xavier Pamela Dolls?

13:27.540 --> 13:28.876
Pretty sure his middle
name's not Pamela.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.979
You know what it is?

13:29.980 --> 13:33.340
Okay, the Cult of
Bulshar, as in Bulshar...

13:33.460 --> 13:36.810
i.e. Sheriff Clootie, AKA the
demon who cursed our family?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.360
Sweetie, do you know another Bulshar?

13:38.550 --> 13:40.399
I know that Wyatt Earp shot him

13:40.400 --> 13:41.419
and had him entombed.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.539
Until his spider wives and
our friend Bobo let him out.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.600
Tsk. Good times.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.839
No, no, I'm saying that Bulshar

13:47.840 --> 13:49.850
has been in the ground for 130 years.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.536
He couldn't have
spearheaded a killing cult.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.100
Maybe he had admirers.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.300
Or bitches in black eager
to do his bidding?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.870
My God, have you seen this?

14:01.360 --> 14:02.609
Nicole?

14:02.610 --> 14:04.740
Hey... it's okay. Uh...

14:05.740 --> 14:07.880
Hey. Come on, let's go
get you some water.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.320
Revenant?

14:20.090 --> 14:21.360
Demon?

14:21.990 --> 14:24.000
Horny flock of Jason Momoas?

14:24.020 --> 14:25.980
Come out, come out, whatever you are.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.120
Hey, bud, if you're looking for
your eight seconds of glory

14:32.140 --> 14:34.260
on the mechanical bull,
she's currently out of order

14:34.300 --> 14:37.010
due to a hella homicide spree.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.660
Also, there was some puke.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.640
Wynonna's in denial and
training herself to death;

14:50.220 --> 14:52.920
Doc's all... sad eyes and quiet mouth,

14:52.940 --> 14:55.590
and you, who's usually my rock...

14:56.390 --> 14:58.000
... having a panic attack?

15:00.240 --> 15:01.980
Not that it's about me.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.700
Keep it together, Earp.

15:07.810 --> 15:09.370
Earp-ish.

15:14.010 --> 15:15.310
Nicole?

15:18.020 --> 15:19.620
You okay in there?

15:23.020 --> 15:24.340
Mm-mm.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.420
Oh! You made me pee a little.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.660
'Least I'm in the right place for it.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.100
Oh, are you hiding in here?

15:32.160 --> 15:34.670
I don't hide. I wait.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.479
It's okay, you're...

15:36.480 --> 15:39.120
you're safe now, okay? You're alive.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.370
Not exactly.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.650
- Did you kill them?
- No.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.099
Are you going to kill us?

15:49.100 --> 15:50.849
Probably not.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.579
That's super cool of you.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.500
We need you as tribute.

15:54.590 --> 15:55.760
Wow.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.580
You are so beautiful.

15:59.660 --> 16:02.160
Ah. And you can't even see it.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.130
Her name's Petra. She's a vampire.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.870
And I love her.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.200
Right?

16:11.580 --> 16:13.440
Best crime scene ever!

16:22.210 --> 16:23.610
Oh, of course.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.680
Waverly, I gotta jet!

16:26.690 --> 16:29.090
Got one mother of an errand to run.

16:33.690 --> 16:35.890
Fire! Hellfire!

16:40.300 --> 16:42.500
No, not fire.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.570
Not in Hell. Not currently.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.170
Uh, I really do miss the
days when you could, uh...

16:49.240 --> 16:52.510
... could shoot a man
for laughing at ya.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.460
Word of warning: in this establishment,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.829
we do not bother to call 9-1-1.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.339
No, okay, yeah, it's not One Direction.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.810
I almost shot ya.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.849
The hell you doing in my basement?

17:27.910 --> 17:30.880
Okay, I... lied. It was One Direction.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.480
But, um, I'm just, uh...

17:33.550 --> 17:36.200
Tweaking Dolls' drugs.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.760
Yeah.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.800
And if I may say,

17:38.801 --> 17:41.320
although it hurts me
to do so physically...

17:41.360 --> 17:42.460
Jeremy.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.660
You look slightly less
dapper than usual.

17:47.570 --> 17:49.960
- You still not sleeping?
- It is hard to sleep

17:50.020 --> 17:52.400
when the demon that cursed the
Earps is still out there.

17:52.470 --> 17:55.070
You ever heard of male
postpartum depression?

17:55.470 --> 17:56.780
It's a thing.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.460
Did you leave the waffle-maker on again?

18:09.790 --> 18:12.660
This is not smoke. It is fog.

18:13.330 --> 18:15.390
Mm. Kinda sexy fog.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.900
Vampires? In Purgatory?

18:24.440 --> 18:27.810
More critically, in my damn bar.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.220
Jeremy, run!

18:39.480 --> 18:41.990
Doc! Doc!

18:47.630 --> 18:51.200
I am so honoured to serve you, my liege.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.770
I have to ask: Thoughts on Twilight?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.200
Look, I know you told me not
to come back here, but...

19:30.270 --> 19:31.870
... we need to talk.

19:32.870 --> 19:35.270
About... him.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.380
So start talking, Mama.

19:45.260 --> 19:46.560
Mama?

19:46.630 --> 19:48.900
So this is what I get?
The silent treatment?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.239
That's real mature.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.020
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't important.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.420
Okay? There's been a murder.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.420
Actually, a lot of murder.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.420
Like, a buttload of murder.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.880
We think it has to do with a cult.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.460
The Cult of Bulshar.

20:02.650 --> 20:04.459
You've said his name to
me before, remember?

20:04.460 --> 20:05.620
The last time...

20:09.090 --> 20:10.760
... he put a curse on our family.

20:10.820 --> 20:12.220
No, no.

20:12.860 --> 20:14.890
He put a curse on the Earps.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.960
Great. Well, you married one.

20:17.030 --> 20:19.959
More the reason I was
known for my big hair...

20:19.960 --> 20:21.199
and my big...

20:21.200 --> 20:24.090
- Mama.
- ... wit, and not my big brains.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.570
Mama, how are you connected to Bulshar?

20:28.670 --> 20:30.880
The voice tells me things about him.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.340
- Mama.
- Quiet!

20:33.410 --> 20:34.880
I need you now.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.920
Waverly needs you now.

20:37.020 --> 20:38.559
You're gonna get your
little sister killed.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.000
I can end the curse.

20:40.090 --> 20:41.190
No!

20:41.250 --> 20:43.020
- Shhh!
- Mama. Mama?

20:43.090 --> 20:44.690
Sit down.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.290
It's fine. Mama.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.660
My daughters are off
limits! Do you hear me?!

20:48.730 --> 20:50.100
Mom!

20:56.700 --> 20:57.940
You sleep half your lives away

20:57.950 --> 21:00.140
and are utterly helpless while doing so.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.240
Amazing you mortals survived this long.

21:02.310 --> 21:05.800
Well, I would hate to have
missed whatever this is.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.350
We've been hearing rumours for months

21:10.420 --> 21:13.050
that John Henry Holliday
is back from the dead.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.350
Well, dead feels pretty
relative these days.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.260
What do you want with him?

21:18.420 --> 21:20.730
Doc Holliday is a rogue.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.860
A legend.

21:23.930 --> 21:28.130
He stole, swore and screwed
his way through the frontier.

21:29.170 --> 21:30.600
Guilty as charged.

21:30.940 --> 21:32.990
Well, we think he'd be
a wonderful addition

21:33.000 --> 21:34.870
to our little blood-sucking menagerie.

21:34.940 --> 21:36.770
You want to recruit me.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.180
Mm...

21:38.260 --> 21:41.080
More like... turn you.

21:42.180 --> 21:43.350
Into what?

21:44.060 --> 21:45.599
You'd get to experience pleasure

21:45.600 --> 21:48.120
you've never even thought of.

21:48.290 --> 21:50.020
And I know you.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.190
You know me?

21:52.260 --> 21:55.260
We know Doc is a dilettante...

21:56.120 --> 21:58.980
with a taste for, well, everything.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.480
What's the catch?

22:00.540 --> 22:02.879
I mean besides finding myself bound

22:02.880 --> 22:05.390
to the apparatus of an ecdysiast.

22:08.010 --> 22:09.710
You have to prove you're actually him.

22:09.780 --> 22:12.880
And how, pray tell... will I do that?

22:18.380 --> 22:20.350
Endure.

22:23.290 --> 22:24.620
She's clearly overmedicated.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.350
Or undermedicated. Hearing
voices, that's new.

22:27.390 --> 22:29.590
And why hasn't she had a
parole hearing in eight years?

22:29.660 --> 22:31.080
Because she's batshit crazy?

22:31.120 --> 22:32.776
And Michelle insisted she
didn't want to leave.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.316
Well, I want access to
all her medical records.

22:34.340 --> 22:35.820
I see no reason to release them.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.779
Your mother's sister,
your Aunt, Gus Gibson,

22:37.780 --> 22:39.260
has power of attorney, whereas you,

22:39.280 --> 22:41.670
her shit-disturbing, felon daughter...

22:41.740 --> 22:43.380
Is a U.S. ranking Marshall

22:43.440 --> 22:44.919
working a cross-border task force

22:44.920 --> 22:46.990
at a very high-level government agency.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Who are you?

22:48.001 --> 22:49.819
- My boss.
- Her partner.

22:49.820 --> 22:50.820
So, Warden...

22:52.640 --> 22:54.920
Michelle Gibson's files, please?

22:55.360 --> 22:57.090
A lot of stuff has been redacted.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.760
How long have you known
that Mama was here?

23:00.690 --> 23:02.140
That I'd been visiting?

23:05.430 --> 23:06.760
You tailed me?

23:06.830 --> 23:09.470
I mean, you've been
sneaking away a lot lately.

23:09.540 --> 23:12.500
I thought, you know, 'cause
you needed some space...

23:12.660 --> 23:14.700
after the baby.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.980
Hmm.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.679
I... I thought you'd be madder.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.200
And I thought you didn't do dairy.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.180
Sometimes you need a
cheeseburger, you know?

23:28.520 --> 23:30.220
What was the official charge?

23:30.290 --> 23:31.319
You didn't know what she was in for?

23:31.320 --> 23:32.380
No.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.239
I remember she got taken away

23:34.240 --> 23:35.619
and I remember Daddy ordering us

23:35.620 --> 23:38.800
to tell Waverly that she'd
run off... voluntarily.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.019
Six months later, dear Daddy was dead,

23:41.020 --> 23:42.440
at my hand.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.979
Mama's talked about Bulshar in the past,

23:46.980 --> 23:49.019
and now he's back and making moves.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.309
Big, bloody moves.

23:50.310 --> 23:52.920
Yeah, maybe, but these
massacres have been happening

23:53.000 --> 23:54.480
for years before without him.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.110
There was somebody at the scene.

23:56.180 --> 23:58.420
Did not look like a choirboy.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.100
- So Bulshar has help.
- So do I.

24:02.780 --> 24:04.090
Alright.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.830
Wynonna?

24:28.700 --> 24:30.580
Talk about a full-meal deal.

24:31.770 --> 24:32.779
Vampires.

24:32.780 --> 24:34.780
Of course. Eventually,
there'd be vampires.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.230
What happened to "Doc
Holliday was a legend"?

24:41.290 --> 24:42.730
Legends get tested.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.900
Please.

24:48.760 --> 24:51.200
Please? Are you pleading?

24:51.270 --> 24:53.770
I am telling you I do not want this.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.040
I don't care what you want!

24:59.180 --> 25:01.380
Fine, we'll take a break.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.770
Besides, there's no way
my kin will believe that

25:04.780 --> 25:07.640
this quivering mass of
boy is Doc Holliday.

25:08.190 --> 25:12.560
So... you came all the way
to Purgatory... for me.

25:12.620 --> 25:14.020
Oh, please.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.199
We came for the show,

25:16.200 --> 25:17.960
to observe when he takes his power back.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.360
- Bulshar.
- Shhh!

25:20.970 --> 25:22.900
He's not to be trifled with.

25:22.970 --> 25:26.100
Everyone must pay him
fealty if they plan to...

25:26.170 --> 25:27.370
Endure?

25:27.440 --> 25:29.970
Me and my team aren't going anywhere.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.300
Teams are for children and stickball.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.720
You'll all be separated.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.900
The old ones he'll
take for his purposes.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.390
Old ones. Oh, and the rest?

25:42.090 --> 25:43.660
Vampire chow.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.359
You will find you have underestimated

25:45.360 --> 25:48.180
the gumption of the
people in this territory.

25:48.230 --> 25:51.120
And myself... yet again.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.540
Again?

25:53.100 --> 25:54.600
Oh, come now.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.040
This whole setup feels awfully personal.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.420
Intimate, even.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.899
I am starting to wonder if...

26:02.900 --> 26:04.900
we are not friends.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.820
Since when does Doc Holliday
care about friends?

26:14.020 --> 26:15.280
Countessa?

26:24.240 --> 26:25.840
And you're still an asshole!

26:34.840 --> 26:36.240
What the... ?

26:36.980 --> 26:38.040
Fog?

26:48.150 --> 26:49.720
Sexy fog.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.140
Please be a surprise Rihanna concert.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.800
Please be a surprise Rihanna concert.

26:58.820 --> 27:00.700
Please be a surprise Rihanna concert.

27:06.670 --> 27:08.640
Fire up the jeep!

27:08.650 --> 27:09.650
We gotta warn everyone

27:09.660 --> 27:11.290
they're responsible for
the murder buttload!

27:11.310 --> 27:12.600
What? Who?

27:12.620 --> 27:15.280
Vampires! I just took
one out in the barn.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.450
Nobody told me Taco Tuesday
was now a formal affair.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.620
You guys, she bitch-stabbed hot Kamen!

27:24.690 --> 27:26.359
What?! He was so hot!

27:26.360 --> 27:27.800
Why isn't she glamoured?

27:29.030 --> 27:30.630
Are you?

27:30.700 --> 27:33.200
When are humans gonna stop
their rampant prejudice

27:33.220 --> 27:34.860
against vampires, who are the best?

27:36.640 --> 27:37.899
Ooh.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.940
Right now!

27:39.070 --> 27:41.820
Ha! Nice one, babe.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.210
Should we finish the job?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.640
I am keen to impress my liege, Ebbe.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.520
Liege? Yeah, that can't be right.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.120
But we can't kill Wynonna.
We love Wynonna.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.380
Well...

27:52.420 --> 27:54.159
And we're not allowed
to hurt her, remember?

27:54.160 --> 27:55.600
Petra said so.

27:55.690 --> 27:58.120
- So what do we do?
- Easy.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.720
We get her ready.

28:00.790 --> 28:04.140
Then we deliver her... in that.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.440
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.900
I am so proud of you, Sheriff.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.920
You're going to be such a good vampire!

28:21.980 --> 28:23.940
And you, son, are gonna be delicious.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.760
Aw, c'mere.

28:26.820 --> 28:28.550
How long has that slinky little number

28:28.560 --> 28:30.066
been hiding at the back of your closet?

28:30.090 --> 28:33.380
Well, I was saving it for
our one-year anniversary,

28:33.400 --> 28:35.930
but this is so much more important.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.900
This is royal-wedding level.

28:38.670 --> 28:41.200
And we're here... together.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.769
For now.

28:43.770 --> 28:45.640
I love you, Waverly Earp,

28:45.700 --> 28:48.240
and nothing will ever tear us apart.

28:48.610 --> 28:50.139
But if it has to be something,

28:50.140 --> 28:52.640
at least it's hot European vampires.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.680
Totally.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.420
But... I don't think I
can watch you get eaten.

28:58.490 --> 29:00.380
Be a... a victim?

29:00.400 --> 29:02.420
I've... I've never been a victim.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.890
I'm a survivor.

29:04.690 --> 29:06.630
No, I'm the survivor. I...

29:06.700 --> 29:08.660
Thank you!

29:08.720 --> 29:10.080
Thank you, koszonom.

29:11.030 --> 29:13.170
Please enjoy yourselves this evening.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.870
One way or another,
it will be your last.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.310
You may not realize it,

29:19.820 --> 29:22.510
but this place you call home is special.

29:23.310 --> 29:25.179
Haunted, yes,

29:25.180 --> 29:27.319
but also... blessed.

29:27.320 --> 29:31.290
It is a tragedy that this triangle
has been wasted on you...

29:31.350 --> 29:34.620
ranch-dressing, smothering
masses of flesh.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.540
Though we appreciate

29:36.560 --> 29:38.019
the obvious effort you've made

29:38.020 --> 29:39.829
to fatten yourselves up.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.719
Do you think he's nearly finished?

29:42.720 --> 29:43.940
My Spanx are riding up.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.539
The good news is,

29:45.540 --> 29:47.980
he will return to save this place.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.510
And we are here to watch him do so.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.950
Ooh, you went bow-tie!

29:56.960 --> 29:59.140
Yeah, you gotta rock out
with your knot out.

29:59.220 --> 30:00.899
Hey, uh, where's Wynonna?

30:00.900 --> 30:02.980
I kinda promised Ebbe that I knew her.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.120
Hey.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.759
- Oh. So cute.
- Yeah, I think we're getting

30:07.760 --> 30:09.380
to first base tonight.

30:09.860 --> 30:11.660
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:14.740 --> 30:17.770
Come in. Holy shit!

30:17.830 --> 30:20.500
That was more cramped than the
canoe I lost my virginity in.

30:20.570 --> 30:22.450
Hey, we're in the basement
of the Gardner house.

30:24.110 --> 30:26.330
I really hope it was
Waverly who dressed me,

30:26.340 --> 30:27.930
but the gloves scream Jeremy.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.720
There are vampires in Purgatory.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.880
Yeah, there are.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.826
They tried to attack me at my
truck, but then I got away.

30:33.850 --> 30:35.519
- Got away how?
- Rest of our friends

30:35.520 --> 30:37.200
and the whole town are
under some sort of spell.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.219
It's like with one touch,
they can control them.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.270
It's like they turn into
vampire-loving groupies.

30:41.290 --> 30:44.260
I spent a month on tour with
Nine Inch Nails. I get it.

30:44.330 --> 30:47.760
Yeah, but guess what. We
can kill them with this.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.430
Nocturnal Exsanguinator Clearance.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.219
Black Badge issued my NEC kit,
first day in the division.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.000
Never had a chance to
use it until right now.

30:57.070 --> 30:58.760
"Kill the vampire who's
glamoured a civilian

30:58.770 --> 31:01.480
and the civilian will
return to their senses."

31:02.340 --> 31:03.940
We're gonna need more stakes.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.270
Waverly called me the guest of honour.

31:27.340 --> 31:29.180
Then you'd better make
one hell of an entrance.

31:33.940 --> 31:35.580
It is time.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.899
Everyone who is a descendant

31:37.900 --> 31:40.480
of the original Purgatory families,

31:40.750 --> 31:43.079
those who lived in terror under Bulshar

31:43.080 --> 31:46.440
when he was Sheriff
Clootie, and then stood by

31:46.540 --> 31:49.490
as Wyatt Earp and Robert Svane

31:49.560 --> 31:51.730
shot and entombed him,

31:51.790 --> 31:55.760
please make your way into the VIP area.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.499
What do I do? I'm not really an Earp.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.340
- So? They don't know that.
- Hey, could I pass for an Earp?

32:02.620 --> 32:04.170
- Wait. No.
- Probably not.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.740
This isn't... this isn't right! Guys.

32:05.810 --> 32:07.780
The VIPs will be offered up

32:07.840 --> 32:10.440
to Bulshar himself, as a tribute,

32:10.510 --> 32:12.780
for him to do with what he may.

32:13.650 --> 32:16.080
The rest of you are for us...

32:16.150 --> 32:17.360
to eat.

32:19.650 --> 32:22.520
I'll tell you what you can eat: a dick.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.080
I beg your pardon?

32:25.760 --> 32:27.059
You heard what I said.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.880
Don't make me say it again.

32:29.330 --> 32:31.730
- Please?
- Darling, how do you expect

32:31.740 --> 32:34.400
to defeat Bulshar when
you can't even resist us?

32:34.470 --> 32:35.560
Hold that thought, Vengabus.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.100
Waverly, who's your favourite vampire?

32:37.140 --> 32:39.540
Ah, I gotta go with Petra.

32:40.010 --> 32:41.080
What?

32:42.110 --> 32:44.150
- How could she choose just one?
- Dolls!

32:50.450 --> 32:52.420
Holy holy water!

32:53.520 --> 32:54.660
Earp!

32:56.830 --> 32:58.390
Hey, sexy.

33:02.830 --> 33:04.299
Wait! Dolls!

33:04.300 --> 33:06.060
Get out of our town!

33:06.760 --> 33:10.040
Purgatory is for the living... mostly.

33:19.210 --> 33:21.350
You will serve us. Protect us.

33:21.420 --> 33:22.760
Always.

33:23.890 --> 33:25.990
Ooh, treasonous.

33:26.050 --> 33:28.440
Does that mean there's an
opening on the VIP roster?

33:30.400 --> 33:32.820
Ah! That's my girlfriend,
you bloodsucking bitch!

33:35.560 --> 33:36.730
Damn straight.

33:43.740 --> 33:45.000
Speaking of your godawful moustache,

33:45.020 --> 33:46.320
when's the last time you saw Doc?

33:46.340 --> 33:47.340
Dunno.

33:50.150 --> 33:52.480
John Henry Holliday,

33:52.550 --> 33:54.880
the greatest gunslinger that ever lived!

33:54.950 --> 33:58.890
I will not get ate while
tied to a stripper pole!

34:00.240 --> 34:01.440
Hopefully.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.530
Argh. Ah!

34:32.199 --> 34:33.418
It's all gone to shit!

34:33.420 --> 34:35.380
They're killing everyone out there!

34:35.420 --> 34:37.139
Ah!

34:38.480 --> 34:40.420
You're free.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.400
And bleeding.

34:45.230 --> 34:46.980
It is you.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.739
What have they done to you?

34:53.810 --> 34:55.880
What I don't want them to do to you.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.810
Whatever happens, stay here.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.900
Countessa!

35:25.410 --> 35:26.940
You'll never take the shot.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.520
You don't have it in you anymore.

35:31.180 --> 35:32.910
No wonder Wyatt left you to die.

35:36.550 --> 35:39.220
I never could abide your tauntin'.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.360
I did come back for you.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.800
Your plasma parfait was a bust.

35:58.070 --> 36:00.640
Don't worry... I'm fine.

36:00.680 --> 36:01.880
Oh, not Ebbe!

36:01.940 --> 36:04.410
I... I think he actually liked me.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.400
Wait.

36:06.401 --> 36:08.520
Why is Doc shirtless?

36:15.120 --> 36:17.820
Hey. You okay?

36:17.860 --> 36:19.500
I am now.

36:20.030 --> 36:21.220
Nice form.

36:22.230 --> 36:23.530
Very nice.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.830
I'm still getting back into it.

36:27.970 --> 36:30.900
Psst. Looks like you, uh, forgot one.

36:42.820 --> 36:44.380
Should've stayed in Sweden, Abba.

36:44.450 --> 36:46.090
I'm from Hungary.

36:46.150 --> 36:48.260
- Hung-a-ry for a di...
- Wynonna.

36:50.060 --> 36:51.419
You know Bulshar.

36:51.420 --> 36:52.900
Do you know what he did to my family?

36:54.420 --> 36:55.980
An endless curse.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.279
All who Wyatt Earp killed

36:58.280 --> 37:00.400
rise from the dead as revenants,

37:00.500 --> 37:03.119
and his chosen descendant
hunts them down

37:03.120 --> 37:04.769
again and again.

37:04.770 --> 37:06.210
Elegant.

37:06.270 --> 37:08.440
Bulshar's wrath will not be.

37:08.510 --> 37:11.940
- Why is he here?
- To finish what he started over a century ago.

37:13.790 --> 37:16.120
I will die before I
tell you anything else.

37:16.180 --> 37:18.159
Well...

37:18.160 --> 37:20.160
... that'll be up to him.

37:20.390 --> 37:21.439
No.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.980
No, I-I can't face him empty-handed.

37:24.090 --> 37:26.630
Well, then, give him this from me.

37:28.100 --> 37:31.370
And do let him know...
I'm coming for him.

37:31.430 --> 37:34.430
You really are a stupid girl.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.040
'Least I'm not over, like vampires.

37:37.110 --> 37:38.740
Oh, and also...

37:39.740 --> 37:41.600
... we're keeping your stripper bus.

37:44.980 --> 37:46.910
Bulshar! Master.

37:46.980 --> 37:48.799
We had them...

37:48.800 --> 37:51.260
the old families, the originals.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.920
But the Earp slag,

37:52.990 --> 37:55.460
Wyatt's heir, got in the way.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.460
There are many ways to serve Bulshar.

37:58.980 --> 38:02.000
You will show others the path.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.530
Ah! Ah!

38:06.800 --> 38:09.140
Ah. Ah! Ah... !

38:26.790 --> 38:28.260
Whisky, neat.

38:30.230 --> 38:31.999
God, it feels good to say that again.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.880
Well, I bet.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.200
Even if it is 10 a.m.

38:36.260 --> 38:40.160
Oh... there's never a
wrong time for whisky.

38:40.740 --> 38:43.420
Except when there is
none at your disposal.

39:03.500 --> 39:07.060
To another day... on God's green Earth.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.200
Spent fighting, no less.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.970
To victory in the face of vampires.

39:15.070 --> 39:16.660
To Alice.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.640
Always.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.720
What's gotten into you?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.600
Something I thought was lost.

39:48.770 --> 39:50.520
Well, welcome back, Holliday.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.739
And the townspeople?

39:55.740 --> 39:56.880
Nedley's on it.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.500
If my head's any indication,
they'll get foggy

39:59.560 --> 40:01.750
on the vampy details of
what happened soon enough.

40:02.450 --> 40:04.620
How did it feel to get glamoured?

40:04.690 --> 40:07.599
Mm. Warm? Yeah, tingly.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.920
Like peeing in the shower?

40:11.260 --> 40:13.790
In the barn, when Kamen
attacked you, you didn't get...

40:13.860 --> 40:16.000
- Nothing.
- Did Peacemaker protect you?

40:16.060 --> 40:18.180
Maybe. And you two?

40:18.360 --> 40:19.440
What happened?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.030
Nothin' I ain't seen before.

40:21.100 --> 40:24.770
Petra tried to glamour me at the
truck multiple times, but...

40:24.780 --> 40:26.950
But you are basically a dragon,

40:26.960 --> 40:29.000
so weren't susceptible to her charms.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.840
Yeah, something like that.

40:30.910 --> 40:33.610
What I Heard: More booze for everyone.

40:33.620 --> 40:34.620
Not for you.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.600
You have to drive Waverly home.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.020
You have something to talk about, right?

40:39.090 --> 40:40.459
Do I have a choice?

40:40.460 --> 40:42.640
You always make the right one, Earp.

40:44.490 --> 40:46.090
Most of the time.

40:46.300 --> 40:47.739
C'mon, baby girl.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.360
I'll explain in the truck.

40:53.180 --> 40:54.559
Oh, thank you.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.939
Nicole still working?

40:55.940 --> 40:57.179
Yeah.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.820
This one really shook her up.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.840
Hmm.

41:04.110 --> 41:06.510
Hmm. Burning the breakfast oil?

41:07.620 --> 41:10.380
Yeah, well, good morning... Vietnamese?

41:10.450 --> 41:12.300
How's it going?

41:12.450 --> 41:14.490
Hard to complain when they can't.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.699
Look at them.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.329
They didn't even see it coming.

41:18.330 --> 41:20.660
Yeah, it's tough, cases like these.

41:20.730 --> 41:23.100
Cases where there are no survivors.

41:24.730 --> 41:26.530
That's just it, Dolls. I'm...

41:27.970 --> 41:31.640
I'm starting to think there was a
Cult of Bulshar survivor once.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.340
And it was me.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.340
- You're pregnant again.
- Hell to the no.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.036
Colluded with Russia
to steal an election.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.409
Nyet.

41:48.410 --> 41:51.360
Oh! You lost my limited-edition
sparkle Ugg slippers?

41:51.620 --> 41:53.040
Check your feet.

41:57.820 --> 42:00.640
Look, whatever Dolls says,
I trust you, Wynonna.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.490
You'll tell me when you're ready.

42:05.460 --> 42:06.700
It's about Mama.

42:08.260 --> 42:09.540
What about Mama?

42:13.900 --> 42:15.260
A prison pass?

42:16.340 --> 42:18.160
Wynonna, look out!

42:45.630 --> 42:48.440
No! Please! No, there's another one!

42:48.480 --> 42:50.840
My sister's still in there! No!

42:50.850 --> 42:52.359
Wynonna!

42:52.360 --> 42:53.969
Oh, no, no!

42:53.970 --> 42:55.600
No!
