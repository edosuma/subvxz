00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
â™ª OHHH OHHH OHHH â™ª

00:06.834 --> 00:09.917
ADDISON:
Archer and I
were terrible sailors.

00:09.959 --> 00:13.333
Heh,
it broke the captain's heart.

00:13.375 --> 00:14.834
Every time we'd tack,

00:14.875 --> 00:17.542
that's when you turn
the sailboat across the wind,

00:17.583 --> 00:19.750
the captain would yell out,
"Ready about!"

00:19.792 --> 00:21.583
And Archer and I would go
and get ready.

00:21.625 --> 00:22.959
And then "Hard alee!"

00:23.000 --> 00:25.208
Which is when you push
the tiller hard to the lee side.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.583
Anyway, if you do it right,

00:27.625 --> 00:29.208
you pick up good wind
and everything's fine.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.041
But if you do it wrong,
as we often did,

00:32.083 --> 00:34.000
you'd wind up in irons.

00:34.041 --> 00:35.542
THERAPIST:
What's "in irons"?

00:35.583 --> 00:38.792
It's when you're
pointing straight at the wind.

00:38.834 --> 00:43.041
And you can try and fight,
but you are stuck.

00:43.083 --> 00:45.583
( upbeat pop music playing )

00:45.625 --> 00:48.458
VIOLET:
Thank you for staying over.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.458
SCOTT:
This was fun.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.000
VIOLET:
Well, I thought so, heh.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.417
I mean, I know that staying up
all night talking and not...

00:54.458 --> 00:55.709
Doing it?
Right.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.917
( both chuckle )

00:56.959 --> 00:58.041
It's fine.
It's not.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.875
It is fine.
It's not fine.

00:59.917 --> 01:02.083
I know you wanted to do it.
I just...

01:02.125 --> 01:05.041
I'm not sure if I'm ready,
you know? I just...

01:05.083 --> 01:09.041
I just got separated
and, you know, you are...

01:09.083 --> 01:12.500
You are very...
What?

01:13.709 --> 01:15.000
Young?

01:16.291 --> 01:19.000
( sighs )

01:20.125 --> 01:25.041
Violet, this is your issue,
it's not mine.

01:25.083 --> 01:28.500
You're right, you're right,
you're right.

01:31.542 --> 01:34.750
Do you wanna stay a little
longer and eat some breakfast?

01:34.792 --> 01:36.000
Mm-hm.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.208
JAKE:
You excited?

01:54.250 --> 01:58.291
I am
cautiously optimistic.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.041
Today you meet
the surrogate candidates?

02:00.083 --> 02:02.375
ADDISON: So I'm told.
JAKE: I have narrowed it down

02:02.417 --> 02:04.917
to a couple of women who I think
would be a good fit for her.

02:04.959 --> 02:08.083
Oh. No. It's like when
the guy buys you a sweater.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.667
It's fluffy, tight and low cut.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.542
What women want
and what men think they want--

02:11.583 --> 02:13.458
There are criteria
they have to meet.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.750
They have given birth to their
child whom they are raising.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.250
Really want a car
with all that mileage?

02:17.291 --> 02:19.291
We have to make sure that she's
gone

02:19.333 --> 02:22.041
through a healthy pregnancy,
devoid of major complications.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.750
Exactly.
It's also essential

02:23.792 --> 02:25.500
that the surrogate knows
how she's gonna feel

02:25.542 --> 02:27.709
being pregnant and giving birth.
AMELIA: Makes sense.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.542
You don't want her to run away
with the baby.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.291
Thank you.
Heh.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.333
Thank you, Amelia.
Now I can worry about that.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.166
JAKE:
We're going
through an agency.

02:35.208 --> 02:36.500
Everything's aboveboard.

02:36.542 --> 02:39.000
There will be a contract.
It'll be fine.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.542
You're right. Yeah.

02:40.583 --> 02:43.041
Because so far getting pregnant,
IVF, adoption,

02:43.083 --> 02:44.917
it's all gone so swimmingly.

02:44.959 --> 02:47.834
I've been a smashing success
on all fronts. Heh.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.917
Thanks.

02:53.959 --> 02:55.333
Morning.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.417
Violet?

03:00.542 --> 03:01.917
Good morning, heh.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.083
Why are you grinning at me?
I'm happy to see you?

03:04.125 --> 03:05.625
You've never said that
to me before.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.542
Maybe I should change that.
Hmm.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.125
Someone rung your bell
last night.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.333
Charlotte,
nobody rang anything.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.458
I'm not asking for details,
I'm just saying.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.792
Whoever he is and whatever
he's doing, keep him around.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.917
It's a nice version of you.

03:22.083 --> 03:23.250
( elevator bell rings )

03:23.291 --> 03:24.542
( chuckles )

03:24.583 --> 03:26.458
( dramatic theme playing )

03:26.500 --> 03:27.792
Violet?

03:29.291 --> 03:32.125
Joanna.
Help me.

03:32.166 --> 03:34.041
VIOLET:
I need some help here.
Stay with me.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.250
( Joanna groaning )

03:35.291 --> 03:37.166
ADDISON:
I need an IV set-up
and a gurney.

03:37.208 --> 03:39.041
NURSE: Right away.
VIOLET: Can you hear me?

03:39.083 --> 03:40.667
She's diaphoretic.
VIOLET: Joanna?

03:40.709 --> 03:42.792
Can you tell us what happened?

03:42.834 --> 03:44.291
My baby.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.709
( Joanna cries )

03:45.750 --> 03:48.041
Are you pregnant, Joanna?
VIOLET: It's okay.

03:48.083 --> 03:50.500
Shh. Joanna? Stay with me.
It's okay.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.875
Joanna? Hey.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.125
Joanna. Joanna.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.792
I never would have met Mason
if Erica wasn't sick.

04:03.834 --> 04:07.000
I never would have known I had
this amazing son out there.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.041
But you do know.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.041
So now we need to focus on
what we need to focus on.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.875
She went to two specialists,
there was nothing they could do.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.333
If she doesn't wanna fight--
You're gonna let her give up?

04:15.375 --> 04:17.083
Amelia is a world-class
neurosurgeon.

04:17.125 --> 04:20.667
Erica knows that,
and she said no.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.750
I can't kidnap her
and force her into an MRI.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.291
One of the most annoying things
about you

04:24.333 --> 04:25.834
is that you don't give up.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.041
( cell phone ringing )

04:27.083 --> 04:28.041
I don't know
what to do here.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.250
This is Dr. King.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.041
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I gotta go.

04:33.083 --> 04:35.166
What am I supposed to do?
Think of something.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.458
MEDIC:
Thirty-seven year old female.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.250
Unconscious with blunt trauma
to the face and abdomen.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.667
PETE:
Wide-bore IV times two,

04:42.709 --> 04:44.709
cross and hold four units.
VIOLET: She's pregnant.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.041
ADDISON:
I need an ultrasound.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.250
PETE:
Brain scan and trauma panel.

04:47.291 --> 04:48.500
VIOLET:
Her husband did this.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.041
I met Joanna six months ago
in an airport.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.500
She was afraid to go back
to New York

04:51.542 --> 04:53.125
because he hit her
during an argument.

04:53.166 --> 04:56.250
ADDISON:
There's blood in her belly.
The baby looks 12 weeks old.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.375
PETE: Get the police.
She told you that he hit her?

04:58.417 --> 05:01.041
She didn't have to.
DAVID: What's going on?

05:01.083 --> 05:03.291
PETE: Who's that?
Husband. You should not be here.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.166
How did this happen?
She was beaten badly.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.291
I need to be with her.
That's not gonna happen.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.291
I don't understand.
You did this.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.291
You don't have to play innocent.
What? No.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.917
When you talked at the airport
and made her stay?

05:13.959 --> 05:15.250
That was my wake-up call.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.500
I got help,
and I've been doing the work.

05:17.542 --> 05:20.250
Anger management, therapy.
Jo and I are doing much better.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.166
I swear to you,
this isn't... It wasn't me.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.291
I need to be with her.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.208
PETE: Hey.
Get your hands off of me.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.709
You don't even know me.
Back up.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.041
CHARLOTTE:
Dr. Wilder, that is enough.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.041
( dramatic theme playing )

05:34.083 --> 05:35.291
( tap on window )

05:35.333 --> 05:37.041
Hey.
Hey.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.000
I heard you guys
had quite a night out.

05:39.041 --> 05:40.542
Ah. Sorry
you couldn't make it.

05:40.583 --> 05:47.000
Yeah. I also heard it was,
uh, pretty successful?

05:48.166 --> 05:49.417
Cooper?

05:49.458 --> 05:51.583
Heh. He was very impressed.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.041
Look, I'm not trying to have
everybody know about that.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.417
Of course.
It was a one-time thing.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.041
Oh, are you retiring
from the league of men

05:58.083 --> 05:59.834
sleeping with
20-something supermodels?

05:59.875 --> 06:01.333
Because if
there's a spot on the roster...

06:01.375 --> 06:04.000
No, I'm just...
I'm looking for something real.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.875
You know what I mean.
I feel the same.

06:05.917 --> 06:08.041
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on, fellas?

06:08.083 --> 06:09.041
SAM:
What's happening?

06:09.083 --> 06:10.750
JAKE: Everything good?
SAM: Yes.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.333
SHELDON:
We were discussing
where to meet

06:12.375 --> 06:14.667
smart, beautiful,
eligible women

06:14.709 --> 06:18.000
to take our minds off the smart,
beautiful, unavailable women.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.875
The million-dollar question.
SAM: Mm-hm.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.041
If you can get beyond
the cheese factor,

06:22.083 --> 06:23.333
I've always loved the gym.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.375
Unlike a bar,
if you don't have any luck,

06:25.417 --> 06:28.792
at least you're getting
a workout in.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.625
Well, I do enjoy multi-tasking.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.291
( mellow theme plays )

06:38.917 --> 06:40.041
What's going on with Joanna?

06:40.083 --> 06:42.375
She's unconscious.
Her blood pressure is down,

06:42.417 --> 06:44.041
and she's bleeding
into her abdomen.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.458
What does that mean?
Is the baby okay?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.667
I couldn't find
the baby's heartbeat.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.041
I'm so sorry.

06:49.083 --> 06:52.458
But because of the trauma,
Joanna lost the baby.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.083
ADDISON:
Look, I know
that this is awful,

06:54.125 --> 06:56.250
but we need to make a decision
right now.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.667
There's a tear in Joanna's
uterine wall.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.875
I might have to do
a hysterectomy to stabilize her.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.250
Do the hysterectomy.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.709
If I stop the bleeding, I might
save her uterus and her life.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.542
Might?
It's riskier, but I think--

07:06.583 --> 07:09.250
Do the hysterectomy.
You can't listen. He did this.

07:09.291 --> 07:10.500
Shut the hell up.

07:10.542 --> 07:12.083
Watch it.
Please.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.500
She can live without a uterus,
I can't live without Joanna.

07:14.542 --> 07:16.125
You're a liar.

07:16.166 --> 07:19.959
He's her husband.
It's his decision to make.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.208
Take her uterus out
and save her life.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.125
( suspenseful theme playing )

07:30.083 --> 07:32.041
( dramatic theme playing )

07:32.083 --> 07:33.250
VIOLET:
He's the one who beat her.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.166
You cannot let him decide
what's best for Joanna.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.291
It's not up to me.
She's unconscious,

07:37.333 --> 07:39.083
the law says
her husband gets to decide.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.000
We don't know what happened.
She told me. David hit her.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.583
Once that we know of,
six months ago.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.083
If he hit her once,
he hit her again.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.667
What do you think
else happened?

07:46.709 --> 07:49.083
This is as hard for me
as it is for anyone else here,

07:49.125 --> 07:51.792
but the police will sort it out,
sooner rather than later.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.709
Until that
or she regains consciousness,

07:53.750 --> 07:55.041
we have to follow the law.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.083
Unfortunately, that means
listening to David Gibson.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.583
This is not the time
to cover your ass, Charlotte.

07:59.625 --> 08:00.875
Really, Pete?

08:00.917 --> 08:03.041
Joanna wants kids, okay?
She told me she does.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.917
Maybe that baby wasn't David's
or maybe he didn't want it,

08:05.959 --> 08:07.083
but you cannot go in there

08:07.125 --> 08:09.709
and take her chance for becoming
a mother. That lets him win.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.083
This isn't any disagreement
Joanna and David had.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.542
It's about saving Joanna.
And David isn't wrong.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.125
Removing her uterus
might be the safest course.

08:17.166 --> 08:20.000
Not to mention that if Addison
tries to save her uterus,

08:20.041 --> 08:22.000
but Joanna dies and it turns out
David didn't do it,

08:22.041 --> 08:24.750
it's not just gonna be my ass
that needs covering.

08:29.625 --> 08:34.166
"Decidedly, I can't draw back.
But at least if I am killed,

08:34.208 --> 08:36.709
I shall be killed
by a musketeer."

08:36.750 --> 08:38.291
Heh, good job.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.041
Can we read
another chapter?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.083
Actually that's enough
for today.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.333
You have a closet to clean.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.959
( chuckles )

08:47.000 --> 08:50.250
All for one...
And one for all.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.709
( chuckles )

08:57.041 --> 08:58.041
What's this?

08:58.083 --> 09:00.041
I spoke to my lawyer,

09:00.083 --> 09:02.667
and I got all the paperwork

09:02.709 --> 09:05.625
to make sure that, uh,
I'll be Mason's legal guardian

09:05.667 --> 09:08.667
in the event of, uh...

09:08.709 --> 09:10.542
In the event of the situation
we're actually in.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.125
Um, do we have
to deal with this now?

09:13.166 --> 09:15.875
I wanna make sure
that there's no custody issues.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.458
Oh, come on, Cooper.
We don't deal with this, Mason,

09:18.500 --> 09:20.208
he could end up
in the care of the state.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.542
( sighs )

09:23.291 --> 09:25.625
I, uh, will sign it later.
Later when?

09:25.667 --> 09:28.000
Later.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.291
( sighs )

09:33.083 --> 09:36.041
I don't think
that you are preparing, Erica.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.375
( chuckles )

09:37.417 --> 09:40.166
I am preparing. I brought him
to see you, didn't I?

09:40.208 --> 09:43.000
I told you I was sick.
After Charlotte found out.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.041
Look, come here.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.208
( sighs )

09:49.250 --> 09:51.709
If you were really preparing,

09:51.750 --> 09:53.083
you would be
taking care of details.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.125
Your will would be done. We'd be
talking about Mason's future.

09:56.166 --> 10:00.041
That's what you do
when you've accepted your fate.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.875
But you're not there yet.

10:01.917 --> 10:04.041
Acceptance is not a stage
that you have reached.

10:04.083 --> 10:08.291
Which means
you have not given up.

10:08.333 --> 10:12.333
I think you still have hope,
Erica.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.291
Don't waste it.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.291
Uh...

10:24.709 --> 10:28.625
Is, uh, what's-her-name really
better than those other doctors?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
( mellow theme playing )

10:39.208 --> 10:41.709
It's better this way.
We doctor, they investigate.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.667
Don't worry,
they'll find out what happened.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.875
How'd it go?

10:44.917 --> 10:46.333
She's still sedated,
lost a lot of blood,

10:46.375 --> 10:48.709
but she's gonna make it.
Thanks, Addison.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.458
How is she? How's Joanna?
ADDISON: She's gonna be okay.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.041
I was able
to control the bleeding

10:53.083 --> 10:54.875
without having to perform
a hysterectomy.

10:54.917 --> 10:56.041
( sighs )

10:56.083 --> 10:59.041
Really? That's great.
What? I thought you said--

10:59.083 --> 11:01.375
CHARLOTTE: That's a good thing.
Just a second.

11:01.417 --> 11:04.041
I specifically told you
not to take that risk.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.291
I don't-- You had no right.
You shouldn't have any rights.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.041
Calm down.
I've done nothing wrong.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.375
Because your wife is still
recovering from what you did,

11:12.417 --> 11:14.208
and she can't tell us
what happened.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.417
As soon as Joanna's stable,
I'm moving her.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.083
It's gonna take time.
Not when my lawyer's involved.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.208
That's not necessary.
No, clearly it is.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.083
I've been assaulted
by a doctor in this hospital.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.041
I'm treated
like a criminal here.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.500
We will transfer her
as soon as possible.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.417
Officer,
can you do anything?

11:29.458 --> 11:30.750
As far as I understand it,

11:30.792 --> 11:32.458
you didn't witness
the first alleged attack.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.041
Mrs. Gibson never filed a report
or a restraining order.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.000
Mr. Gibson
has no history of violence.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.625
And there are no witnesses
to account for what happened.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.667
You cannot allow him
to take her.

11:41.709 --> 11:44.041
OFFICER:
My department will continue
to investigate this,

11:44.083 --> 11:45.417
but without evidence,

11:45.458 --> 11:47.583
until the victim wakes up
and files a complaint,

11:47.625 --> 11:49.166
my hands are tied.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.000
( dramatic theme playing )

11:59.208 --> 12:04.041
I'm so sorry. I had an emergency
surgery. I'm Addison, heh.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.041
Donna was just telling me
about her husband

12:06.083 --> 12:07.709
who's stationed
on an aircraft carrier.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.291
Oh, that's terrific.

12:09.333 --> 12:12.917
He's a Navy pilot and we're
proud, but it's challenging.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.834
We have two great kids,
10 and 6.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.041
But they miss their dad,
and it's busy for me.

12:17.083 --> 12:20.041
So, uh, being a surrogate
would...?

12:20.083 --> 12:21.875
Will help out financially.

12:21.917 --> 12:24.250
Being a surrogate is noble,
but it's a business.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.625
You're a professional,
Dr. Montgomery,

12:26.667 --> 12:29.875
you must recognize that
I have a valuable skill set

12:29.917 --> 12:31.875
that I wanna put to work
for you.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.917
( mellow theme playing )

12:37.458 --> 12:39.041
( sighs )

12:39.083 --> 12:40.750
Hello.
Hey.

12:40.792 --> 12:43.083
How'd it go
with the surrogate?

12:43.125 --> 12:46.208
She's very business-like.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.125
Well, that's good, right?
Oh.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.542
No, I mean, you want her

12:49.583 --> 12:51.709
to carry the child and give it
to you, not be the mother.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.041
That'll be your job.
Okay.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.500
And your job is to tell me
everything's gonna be fine.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.458
I'm gonna know the right
surrogate when I meet her.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.333
I don't think it's about
finding the right one,

13:00.375 --> 13:01.625
it's finding a good one.

13:01.667 --> 13:05.041
Hey, um, do you know, um...?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.125
( chuckles )

13:06.166 --> 13:08.667
Do you know this, um, young--?

13:08.709 --> 13:11.667
This, uh, paramedic
named Scott?

13:11.709 --> 13:14.125
Hot Scott?
Heh, yes.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.375
Violet.
I know. It's so crazy.

13:16.417 --> 13:19.583
What? What's crazy?
He's young and, you know...

13:19.625 --> 13:22.166
What the hell am I doing?
Are you having fun?

13:22.208 --> 13:23.709
Yes.
Good.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.750
Young is great.
Young is virile.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.166
Virile young buck.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.500
Oh, Violet, gosh.
You like him, he likes you.

13:30.542 --> 13:34.083
Don't think about it and enjoy.
You deserve it. Hmm.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.083
Sorry, doctors,
but Joanna Gibson? She's awake.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.375
AMELIA:
The gliosarcoma has grown
considerably

13:41.417 --> 13:43.375
since the last scans.
Because of its size

13:43.417 --> 13:45.792
and its proximity to
the intracranial blood supply,

13:45.834 --> 13:48.291
surgical intervention
is unlikely to succeed.

13:48.333 --> 13:52.000
So the sky is blue,
and tacos taste great.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.792
Tell me something
I don't already know.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.083
Is this impossible to treat
or just impossible to cure?

13:56.125 --> 13:58.792
The best we can do
is aggressive radiation therapy

13:58.834 --> 14:01.083
with combination chemotherapy
to slow the tumor's growth.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.417
Maybe that could give Erica
six months or so,

14:03.458 --> 14:05.375
depending on the efficacy
of the chemotherapy.

14:05.417 --> 14:07.041
Six months
of what kind of life?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.041
Honestly? Rough.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.709
Any time you do chemo,
there are side effects:

14:11.750 --> 14:13.417
fatigue, nausea, infection.

14:13.458 --> 14:16.542
But the most important thing in
cancer treatment is buying time.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.041
Because there's always progress
being made.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.125
There's new trials, new drugs.
Come on, Cooper.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.166
You really think they're gonna
have a cure for cancer

14:23.208 --> 14:24.333
in six months?

14:24.375 --> 14:28.709
Look, I came, I listened,
I'm done.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.458
What did you do with Mason
on his last birthday?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.208
What?
No, just tell me.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.041
We did go-karts.
He loves driving.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.417
He can't wait
to get his license.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.083
And what's he wanna do
on his next birthday?

14:44.083 --> 14:45.458
Screw you.

14:45.500 --> 14:49.583
If you don't want to believe
in a miracle, that's fine.

14:49.625 --> 14:52.917
But you could give Mason
one more birthday together,

14:52.959 --> 14:55.709
one more summer vacation,
one more Christmas.

14:55.750 --> 15:01.041
And that's not much,
it's not enough,

15:01.083 --> 15:02.834
but it would mean
everything to him.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.000
( melancholic theme playing )

15:10.709 --> 15:11.750
( door closes )

15:15.083 --> 15:17.000
( upbeat pop music playing )

15:30.333 --> 15:33.750
Ugh, I feel like we're
two sides of a poetic debate.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.041
I mean, which is better?

15:35.083 --> 15:37.291
To have loved and lost
or to have never loved at all.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.917
You don't have to fight
the memories.

15:38.959 --> 15:41.041
Don't discount
the agony of regret.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.083
I mean, if only I had said yes
when Amelia was interested...

15:44.125 --> 15:45.500
( sighs )

15:45.542 --> 15:48.625
The imagination is a powerful
tool of self-torture.

15:48.667 --> 15:52.458
Okay.
This isn't working for me.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.667
Me neither.

15:53.709 --> 15:54.959
Hi.

15:56.333 --> 15:59.041
Hi, I'm, uh, I'm Sam.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.041
Hi, Sam.
Hey.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.667
Are you done with that bike?

16:02.709 --> 16:05.709
There's a time limit
on the cardio equipment.

16:05.750 --> 16:09.792
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.000
David didn't want a baby.

16:17.792 --> 16:21.083
I thought it would help us
start over.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.083
( sobbing )

16:23.125 --> 16:27.125
I planned this
special breakfast to tell him.

16:27.166 --> 16:32.291
Poached eggs and orange juice
from the tree in my mom's...

16:33.542 --> 16:35.041
( cries )

16:35.083 --> 16:36.083
My mom died.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.041
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:38.083 --> 16:43.125
It's better. If she saw this,
if she knew her grandchild...

16:48.750 --> 16:53.125
I was so excited
to be pregnant.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.959
I just figured
he would be too.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.000
But he wasn't.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.583
( melancholic theme playing )

17:05.625 --> 17:08.959
It happened so fast.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.291
I...

17:12.500 --> 17:15.875
I got up to get him more food,

17:15.917 --> 17:21.125
and when I turned around,
I saw his fist coming at me,

17:21.166 --> 17:25.375
but it was in slow motion.
I, uh, couldn't move.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.875
He killed our baby.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.041
Joanna, the police wanna
build a case against David,

17:39.083 --> 17:40.625
but they're gonna need
your statement.

17:40.667 --> 17:44.083
I, uh, don't wanna do that.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.834
Joanna, I will help you do it.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.625
I will be with you
every step of the way.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.709
I know you're scared,
but--

17:50.750 --> 17:53.250
I'm not scared.
I am furious.

17:53.291 --> 17:54.291
And I understand that but--

17:54.333 --> 17:59.041
No, Violet, you can't.
He hit me.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.875
He came at me,
and he punched me in the face.

18:01.917 --> 18:05.834
My husband
punched me in the face.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.667
There was nothing I could do.
David needs to go to jail.

18:08.709 --> 18:11.542
No. He beat me.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.250
And he killed my baby.

18:14.291 --> 18:17.709
No. No.

18:17.750 --> 18:23.041
No, I want him dead.
I, uh, want him to die.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.875
Joanna...

18:24.917 --> 18:26.375
I wanna kill him.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.125
I'm gonna kill him.

18:38.125 --> 18:41.417
ADDISON:
So she said she wanted
to kill David?

18:41.458 --> 18:42.875
PETE:
Who, Joanna?

18:42.917 --> 18:45.041
I hope that wasn't the statement
she gave the police.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.750
She wouldn't talk to them.
She told me.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.458
Did you tell the police?
Or David?

18:48.500 --> 18:50.041
Confessing a plan
to murder someone

18:50.083 --> 18:52.166
isn't protected by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.709
And if a therapist hears it,

18:53.750 --> 18:56.500
she can be held liable
if she doesn't report it.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.500
There's a difference between
a threat and a plan.

18:58.542 --> 19:01.041
Joanna didn't tell the police
so she could kill him.

19:01.083 --> 19:02.667
ADDISON:
Come on, Charlotte.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.542
She just heard
her husband killed her baby,

19:04.583 --> 19:06.041
a baby he never wanted,

19:06.083 --> 19:07.917
and tried to force her
to have a hysterectomy.

19:07.959 --> 19:10.041
She is allowed to have
an emotional response.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.041
And she needs to feel the safety

19:11.083 --> 19:13.041
to express that anger
to a therapist.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.709
And now you have a legal
obligation to deal with it.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.500
Wait a minute. Violet's
not technically her therapist.

19:18.542 --> 19:19.500
Your license was suspended

19:19.542 --> 19:21.083
most of the time
you were talking to her.

19:21.125 --> 19:24.041
She's not a formal patient.
I mean, there's no file--

19:24.083 --> 19:25.750
Pete is right.
We're just friends.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.709
Friends do not have
a legal obligation, right?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.625
No, Violet,
you can't have it both ways.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.083
You do have your license
back now.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.542
The moment you heard the threat,
you were a therapist.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.041
Not hers.
Would a court see it that way?

19:36.083 --> 19:37.709
CHARLOTTE:
I won't second-guess Violet

19:37.750 --> 19:39.208
and say this guy
isn't a dirtbag criminal,

19:39.250 --> 19:41.041
but if David's life
is really threatened,

19:41.083 --> 19:42.291
we have
a moral obligation here.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.542
Where is he, anyway?
I sent him home last night

19:44.583 --> 19:46.041
before she regained
consciousness.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.083
Say Violet does warn David,

19:48.125 --> 19:50.083
and then he retaliates
against Joanna. What then?

19:50.125 --> 19:54.959
Look, Violet, I'm on your side,
but how do we protect everyone?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
( dramatic theme playing )

19:58.667 --> 20:02.000
You have to go into this
with an open mind.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.041
ADDISON:
She's not right.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.041
You haven't even met her yet.

20:07.083 --> 20:10.625
I can feel the warmth
from her every pore.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.125
It's nauseating me
all the way over here.

20:12.166 --> 20:14.583
Have you secretly been giving
yourself hormone shots again?

20:14.625 --> 20:17.041
Look, I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna ask June

20:17.083 --> 20:18.959
what the best part
about being a surrogate is,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.041
and she's gonna give me
some weird, hippy-dippy answer

20:23.083 --> 20:25.458
about the magic of motherhood.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.709
You have no idea
what she's gonna say.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.041
Okay, fine. Let's go.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.750
( mellow theme playing )

20:32.083 --> 20:35.500
So, June, what was the best part
of your last experience?

20:35.542 --> 20:39.041
That's easy. The parents let me
keep the placenta,

20:39.083 --> 20:44.667
and they came to my house to
help me bury it in the garden.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.625
( sighs )

20:46.667 --> 20:48.417
And we planted a tree there.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.834
Hmm.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.667
SAM:
Okay, so what about church?

20:53.709 --> 20:57.041
Hmm. No, that's
too much commitment for me.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.041
I know,
but the whole point

20:58.083 --> 21:00.375
is to meet women
who want commitment.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.041
If only there was
some computer-based system

21:02.083 --> 21:05.333
where eligible people from
all over the land could connect.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.709
Online dating is the number one
way to meet women.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.208
We're looking for women of more
depth than those cyber-honeys

21:10.250 --> 21:11.667
you used to meet
on those sites.

21:11.709 --> 21:14.250
Heh, I met my wife
on one of those sites.

21:14.291 --> 21:16.875
Yeah, but, I mean,
you knew her in real life.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.458
And hated her and she hated me.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.834
But by going online

21:19.875 --> 21:21.750
and stripping away
all the preconceived notions,

21:21.792 --> 21:24.542
we were able to find out we were
actually very compatible.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.834
WOMAN ( over PA ):
Portable X-ray to the ER.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.458
Portable X-ray to the ER.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.166
Where's my wife?
I released her.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.375
I told you I wanted to take her
to another hospital.

21:40.417 --> 21:42.041
It was Joanna's request
to leave.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.542
I never got a chance
to talk to her.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.083
Not my problem.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.041
( dramatic theme playing )

21:47.083 --> 21:48.834
This is not over.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.041
Yes, it is.
Now back the hell away from me

21:54.083 --> 21:56.959
before I have your ass
dragged out of my hospital.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.083
PETE:
Your solution
was to bring Joanna home?

22:09.125 --> 22:11.041
All she'd do
in the hospital is recover,

22:11.083 --> 22:12.500
and I can take
better care of her here.

22:12.542 --> 22:13.709
( babbles )

22:13.750 --> 22:15.625
Yeah.
Better than the nursing staff?

22:15.667 --> 22:17.417
What if there's a complication
or emergency?

22:17.458 --> 22:19.959
I'll call the ambulance. There's
not gonna be an emergency.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.166
And I can change a bandage.
I am a doctor, Pete.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.125
( Lucas babbling )

22:24.166 --> 22:26.500
I just...

22:26.542 --> 22:29.083
I need you to take Lucas
for a few days.

22:29.125 --> 22:32.083
There are shelters where she'd
be safe. And you would be too.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.083
A shelter is not ideal

22:33.125 --> 22:34.750
for somebody
recovering from surgery.

22:34.792 --> 22:37.041
And this way I'll be able
to talk to her. Really talk.

22:37.083 --> 22:39.250
You know, find out
if the threat is real.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.875
She's protected because
he doesn't know where she is.

22:41.917 --> 22:44.250
He's protected because
I'm not leaving her side.

22:44.291 --> 22:46.000
I'm protected
because both of them are.

22:46.041 --> 22:49.458
I don't like you
putting yourself in the middle.

22:49.500 --> 22:53.667
Well, there's a lot of decisions
I make that you might not like,

22:53.709 --> 22:55.667
but you don't really get a say
in them anymore.

22:55.709 --> 22:58.208
But what you do get a say in

22:58.250 --> 23:01.125
is whether Lucas
is in the middle of it too.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.542
Okay.
You give my truck.

23:05.583 --> 23:08.041
VIOLET:
You wanna hold it, baby?
Daddy's gonna take you, okay?

23:08.083 --> 23:10.583
PETE:
Okay, pal. Are you ready?

23:10.625 --> 23:12.041
Up.
Do you want the truck?

23:12.083 --> 23:14.041
Yeah. Here.
LUCAS: My truck?

23:14.083 --> 23:18.083
Here it is. I love you.
Be good.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.000
Bye-bye.
PETE: Here we go.

23:22.542 --> 23:23.917
VIOLET:
Hey, Pete?

23:25.500 --> 23:28.458
If you were me,
what would you have done?

23:29.458 --> 23:31.041
The same thing.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.000
Thank you.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.250
Bye-bye.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.291
( melancholic theme playing )

23:50.166 --> 23:53.000
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.

23:57.583 --> 23:58.834
Are you mad at me?

23:58.875 --> 24:00.625
Mad? No.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.625
I'm not trying to be a pain
about the surrogate stuff.

24:02.667 --> 24:05.041
You don't have
to apologize, all right?

24:05.083 --> 24:06.250
But let's stop wasting time,

24:06.291 --> 24:08.458
because your heart's
definitely not into this.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.250
You'll find a flaw with anyone
who wants to do this for you.

24:12.291 --> 24:14.041
That is not true.
It is.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.500
And there's nothing wrong
with these surrogates.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.458
They're all fine.
So what? I'm the problem?

24:18.500 --> 24:21.291
You said it, not me.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.291
ERICA:
Hey.

24:26.333 --> 24:30.875
Um, I need to ask you
a question,

24:30.917 --> 24:32.583
and I want you to give me
an honest answer.

24:32.625 --> 24:35.625
Um, whatever you say,
I won't tell Cooper.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.583
Okay.
Um...

24:39.625 --> 24:43.542
They give you these pamphlets
on the side effects of chemo.

24:43.583 --> 24:47.875
You know, the hair loss,
nausea, vomiting, bleeding.

24:47.917 --> 24:52.000
Not specific, bleeding
from where. I've read them all.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.500
What I wanna ask is, um,

24:56.083 --> 24:57.792
if you were in my shoes,

24:59.375 --> 25:02.375
would you put yourself
through this?

25:02.417 --> 25:03.750
Destroying
your quality of life

25:03.792 --> 25:08.041
for the chance at maybe
a few more painful months?

25:08.083 --> 25:11.083
Or would you spend
every possible healthy moment

25:11.125 --> 25:14.083
with the most important person
in your life?

25:14.125 --> 25:16.125
( melancholic theme playing )

25:27.583 --> 25:29.000
I wouldn't.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.375
I wouldn't do the treatment.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.792
Yeah.

25:55.250 --> 25:59.250
No, no, no. Sam,
you can't put hair color: bald.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.583
Why not?
I shave my head.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.458
No, no, no. You put
what color your hair would be

26:03.500 --> 26:04.667
if it grew out, you know?

26:04.709 --> 26:06.458
And... What?

26:06.500 --> 26:09.625
You put you're a grandpa on
the first line about yourself?

26:09.667 --> 26:10.875
Heh.
What, are you crazy?

26:10.917 --> 26:12.875
Well, I'm proud
to be a grandpa.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.166
No, listen,
you can be forthcoming,

26:14.208 --> 26:16.083
but you can still be delicate
with the truth.

26:16.125 --> 26:20.625
So bald is well-groomed and
grandpa is just a family man.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.166
Okay, the section
on physical attributes

26:22.208 --> 26:23.667
is depressing
in present company,

26:23.709 --> 26:27.792
so I'm just gonna move on
to questions of substance.

26:27.834 --> 26:29.667
"What is your biggest flaw?"

26:29.709 --> 26:32.041
Too sensitive.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.208
That's gold.
Yeah, well, maybe for you.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.834
Your answer, Prince Charming?

26:35.875 --> 26:37.208
Too passionate about my work.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.208
Hmm. That's good.
Okay, yeah. No, you're good.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.041
I see my sage advice
is being heeded.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.208
Okay, Mr. Sage, what would be
Sam's ideal first date?

26:46.250 --> 26:49.083
Well... Excuse me.
Sure.

26:49.125 --> 26:53.834
I used to start with, uh, this.

26:53.875 --> 26:54.834
Yeah.
BOTH: Ugh.

26:54.875 --> 26:57.125
No, no, no.
That's...

26:57.166 --> 27:00.041
Cooper, this is
a family practice. Please.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.417
Whatever it is,
I need to see it.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.834
They're writing
their online dating profiles.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.959
( chuckling )

27:06.000 --> 27:07.875
What's wrong with that?

27:07.917 --> 27:10.709
Nothing. But why is Sam
bothering to write anything?

27:10.750 --> 27:13.083
He should just post
a shirtless picture of himself

27:13.125 --> 27:14.500
with "Dr. Bennett" above it.

27:14.542 --> 27:16.709
He'll have a thousand dates
in an hour.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.291
And Sheldon,

27:18.333 --> 27:20.750
It's not like he needs the rest
of you yahoos to tell him

27:20.792 --> 27:22.583
what a girl wants to hear.

27:27.417 --> 27:30.208
Well, maybe loved and lost
is better, man.

27:44.834 --> 27:46.083
I'm sorry.

27:46.125 --> 27:49.291
The last thing you need
is to be taking care of me.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.291
It's fine.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.417
You have Lucas to worry about.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.208
Plus Pete.
VIOLET: Lucas is doing fine.

27:54.250 --> 27:58.709
And Pete and I, you know,
we're working through it.

27:58.750 --> 28:02.375
It's a lot better.
There's less anger.

28:02.417 --> 28:04.417
So you don't have
to worry about it.

28:04.458 --> 28:06.333
Pull your shirt up.

28:10.834 --> 28:14.875
I read your book.
It made me feel like a failure.

28:14.917 --> 28:15.959
Why?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.583
You went through
this terrible thing,

28:18.625 --> 28:21.166
and you overcame it. But I...

28:22.375 --> 28:25.500
I knew in my heart.

28:26.917 --> 28:29.458
I mean, hit me once,
shame on you, hit me twice...

28:29.500 --> 28:31.667
But I went back to David anyway.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.000
Well...

28:34.458 --> 28:37.542
that was a mistake,
and you can correct it.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.125
By going to the police?

28:39.166 --> 28:43.041
I've seen those women
on the stand, in court.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.000
The victims.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.000
I'm not a victim.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.792
Being a victim
does not mean you're powerless.

28:50.834 --> 28:53.041
But I chose to be with him.

28:53.083 --> 28:56.458
I let him back in.
It's my fault.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.583
You don't understand that,

28:58.625 --> 29:00.500
because what happened to you
wasn't your fault.

29:00.542 --> 29:03.917
It felt like it was.
It always does.

29:03.959 --> 29:08.041
I have great faith
in people's capacity to change.

29:08.083 --> 29:11.625
My patients. My husband.

29:11.667 --> 29:17.041
And when they don't, I assume
that I did something wrong.

29:17.083 --> 29:20.875
And sometimes I did.
But a lot of times I didn't.

29:20.917 --> 29:24.667
But I can't tell the difference
in my own life. No one can.

29:24.709 --> 29:29.125
It's understandable that
you would think he could change.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.959
Joanna, we need to talk about
what you said.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.458
About David.

29:39.500 --> 29:43.041
Oh, Violet, no. No, please.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.458
I, unh...

29:44.500 --> 29:49.041
You really think I'm gonna
kill David? I was just upset.

29:49.083 --> 29:52.458
I was frustrated and hurting.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.041
You can understand that,
can't you?

29:54.083 --> 29:55.083
Yes, yes, yes.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.583
Of course I can.
But I also know that,

29:57.625 --> 30:00.000
you know, if a person
is pushed past

30:00.041 --> 30:03.750
any reasonable limit, you--

30:03.792 --> 30:06.333
Oh, Joanna.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.709
I can't believe that you would
think that I would do that.

30:11.750 --> 30:15.083
I mean, no matter what happened.
I just...

30:15.125 --> 30:16.375
( Joanna sighs )

30:16.417 --> 30:19.291
I just wanna be somewhere
where I feel safe

30:19.333 --> 30:20.709
and I don't have to be scared,

30:20.750 --> 30:22.917
and I can start putting my life
back together again.

30:26.083 --> 30:27.291
You are.

30:27.333 --> 30:29.083
( mellow pop music playing )

30:39.333 --> 30:42.083
( sighs )

30:42.125 --> 30:44.500
How's the rent-a-womb search
going?

30:44.542 --> 30:46.750
They're all wrong.

30:46.792 --> 30:49.542
And Jake thinks I'm being
unfair and judgmental,

30:49.583 --> 30:50.834
but it is a huge decision.

30:50.875 --> 30:52.500
You know?

30:52.542 --> 30:55.625
Finding someone
to carry my baby.

30:55.667 --> 30:58.375
The first one was like
a breeding machine.

30:58.417 --> 31:01.041
The second one looked like
she just wandered off a commune.

31:01.083 --> 31:04.000
I don't know.

31:04.041 --> 31:05.667
I could do it.
What?

31:05.709 --> 31:09.208
I'm the closest thing you have
to a sister.

31:09.250 --> 31:10.750
And I can do this.

31:10.792 --> 31:13.041
Amelia.

31:13.083 --> 31:17.041
I know. I'm the anti-surrogate.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.750
I'm an addict and I wouldn't
pass the psych eval,

31:19.792 --> 31:24.041
and it's semi-creepy
that I'm your ex-sister-in-law.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.792
It would be a monumental failure
of your brilliant mind

31:26.834 --> 31:28.041
to pick me.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.834
But I wanna do it.

31:31.291 --> 31:34.667
I wanna do this one
completely selfless thing.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.875
There are people
that we can't help.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.083
There are inoperable
brain tumors

31:39.125 --> 31:42.208
and kids who face
too much tragedy and...

31:42.250 --> 31:43.500
And Ryan.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.458
Bringing a life
into this world,

31:47.500 --> 31:51.208
it could be the thing
that I can do to make up for--

31:51.250 --> 31:55.667
I can help you.
I wanna help you.

31:55.709 --> 31:59.458
Let me, Addie. Please.

32:01.333 --> 32:04.041
I love you, Amelia,

32:04.083 --> 32:06.709
and I'm honored
that you've offered this,

32:06.750 --> 32:10.041
but the most important thing
that you can do

32:10.083 --> 32:14.041
now that you're sober,
is to figure out who you are.

32:14.083 --> 32:18.083
And who you are,
can't be my surrogate.

32:25.083 --> 32:27.000
( knocking on door )

32:30.083 --> 32:33.250
Hi. Declaration of paternity.

32:33.291 --> 32:35.709
Application to amend
the birth certificate.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.750
We can go to your lawyer
tomorrow to sign these.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.875
That should cover
your custody concerns.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.000
This is acceptance.

32:43.583 --> 32:46.041
You won't try the treatment?
Even for Mason?

32:46.083 --> 32:48.125
Everything I do is for Mason.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.667
Every single thing

32:49.709 --> 32:51.583
since the moment
I found out I was pregnant.

32:51.625 --> 32:52.792
I brought him here to meet you,

32:52.834 --> 32:55.041
which I wasn't gonna do
in a million years.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.500
I did it for him.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.291
I'm changing
the birth certificate for him.

32:59.333 --> 33:02.458
Erica. You have to fight.
I can't win.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.250
I don't wanna fight if
there's not a chance I can win.

33:05.291 --> 33:07.041
There is.
There's always a chance.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.959
Even if at first
it just means buying time--

33:09.000 --> 33:12.250
Cooper, please, stop it.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.625
Now you need
to accept it. Okay?

33:22.750 --> 33:25.500
He says he wants to see
the Grand Canyon.

33:25.542 --> 33:27.125
For his next birthday.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.792
Just so you know.

33:34.250 --> 33:36.166
( door closes )

33:44.083 --> 33:46.000
Hey, hey.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.667
( Joanna groaning )

33:49.709 --> 33:51.166
Now you're spoiling me.

33:51.208 --> 33:53.041
Please, you haven't
tasted the eggs yet.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.125
You need anything else?

33:54.166 --> 33:56.250
For you to get back
to your life.

33:56.291 --> 33:58.792
I'm fine.
I'm gonna get the paper.

33:58.834 --> 34:03.041
And, uh, you can eat,
then we'll, uh, plan the day.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.959
Maybe we'll get you up
for, uh, a walk later.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.041
Where is she?
I wanna talk to my wife.

34:08.083 --> 34:10.458
VIOLET: She's not here.
I love you so much. I'm sorry.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.041
I don't want to see you,
David!

34:12.083 --> 34:14.333
VIOLET: Get out of my house.
DAVID: I just wanna talk to her.

34:14.375 --> 34:17.041
I'm not leaving without my wife.
No, I'm leaving you, David.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.208
Please, don't say that.
You are a bastard

34:19.250 --> 34:22.250
and a bully and a coward.
I don't love you.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.208
I could never love you again.

34:24.250 --> 34:28.041
Shut up! Stop saying that.
This is your fault.

34:28.083 --> 34:31.083
VIOLET: Just leave.
JOANNA: Leave her alone! Go!

34:31.125 --> 34:33.875
You killed my baby! I'd never
love someone who did that!

34:33.917 --> 34:35.792
Shut up!
JOANNA: Shut up and go!

34:35.834 --> 34:37.041
( Joanna screams )

34:38.083 --> 34:40.041
( tense theme playing )

34:40.083 --> 34:43.667
JOANNA:
I hate you. I hate you.

34:43.709 --> 34:46.500
You bastard.
You killed my baby.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.792
( Joanna crying )

34:47.834 --> 34:51.291
I hate you. I hate you.

34:51.333 --> 34:55.083
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you.

34:55.125 --> 34:57.500
I hate you.
VIOLET: Oh, my God.

34:57.542 --> 35:01.625
JOANNA: I hate you.
VIOLET: Joanna. Joanna. Joanna.

35:01.667 --> 35:06.041
I hate you.
He's dead! You have to stop!

35:06.083 --> 35:09.000
Stop. Stop.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.500
Stop.

35:13.542 --> 35:15.709
( crying )

35:22.709 --> 35:26.000
I had to. I had to.
He didn't give me a choice.

35:27.375 --> 35:33.041
I had to protect myself.
And you. I had to.

35:33.083 --> 35:36.000
( sobbing )

35:37.834 --> 35:40.625
You'll tell the police that,
right?

35:43.083 --> 35:45.959
I had to.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.500
Hey.

35:55.542 --> 35:57.083
Hey.

35:58.291 --> 36:02.667
So I was, uh, surprised
that you called.

36:02.709 --> 36:05.083
Thank you for coming.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.500
Look, have a seat.

36:07.542 --> 36:08.750
( chuckles )

36:11.667 --> 36:13.959
I just wanna tell you,
you were right.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.125
About what?

36:15.166 --> 36:17.083
There is something wrong
with me.

36:17.125 --> 36:18.208
Oh, no, Addison,

36:18.250 --> 36:19.709
I didn't mean
to make you feel like--

36:19.750 --> 36:22.041
No, it's not your fault.
It's just, um...

36:22.083 --> 36:26.375
I just need a break.
From all of it.

36:27.959 --> 36:29.041
You're giving up?

36:29.083 --> 36:31.500
No. I want a baby.
I will have a baby.

36:31.542 --> 36:33.500
I just...

36:33.542 --> 36:38.959
Right now, I just need
to be for a while.

36:40.083 --> 36:44.792
I need to focus on something
else, on anything else.

36:46.709 --> 36:51.000
Yeah. Yeah,
I think that's smart.

36:56.083 --> 36:59.291
So you, uh, want some company?

37:00.709 --> 37:03.709
Yeah, I do.

37:08.834 --> 37:11.000
( indistinct chattering )

37:14.333 --> 37:16.458
JOANNA:
I understand. I--

37:16.500 --> 37:20.041
I go to the station,
I could call a lawyer.

37:20.083 --> 37:24.041
DETECTIVE:
So when you woke up,
he was already dead?

37:29.083 --> 37:32.041
Dr. Turner?
He was already dead.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.041
So you didn't see
what actually happened

37:35.083 --> 37:36.333
before she stabbed him?

37:38.917 --> 37:41.250
Well, it was self-defense.

37:45.083 --> 37:46.917
He broke into my home.

37:46.959 --> 37:50.625
He attacked both of us.
It was self-defense.

37:50.667 --> 37:55.542
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Violet.

37:58.083 --> 37:59.500
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

37:59.542 --> 38:01.041
Let me see.
Yeah. I'm okay.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.041
I just gotta move out
of this place, but yeah.

38:03.083 --> 38:06.542
What can I do?
What do you need?

38:08.083 --> 38:10.417
Uh, can you just
keep taking care of Lucas?

38:10.458 --> 38:11.458
I'm just gonna clean up.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.875
Of course. Of course.
Thank you.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.709
( mellow pop music playing )

38:22.834 --> 38:24.000
( sighs )

38:29.083 --> 38:31.166
I tried to make her go
to treatment.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.333
I know you did.

38:32.375 --> 38:36.458
I really tried.
I know.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.000
No. It was...

38:42.500 --> 38:45.458
If Erica wasn't sick,
I never would have met Mason.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.041
So you keep saying.

38:47.083 --> 38:49.000
No, Charlotte.

38:52.875 --> 38:57.166
If Erica wasn't sick,
I never would have met Mason.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.166
And you feel guilty

39:00.208 --> 39:03.458
because of how grateful you are
that this happened?

39:05.083 --> 39:07.500
( sobbing )

39:07.542 --> 39:09.333
Hey.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.959
Can I come in?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.792
Yeah. What happened?
Did somebody hit you?

39:31.834 --> 39:34.000
I don't wanna talk about it.

39:34.041 --> 39:39.583
Okay. All right. Let's, uh,
sit down. Let me take a look.

39:49.166 --> 39:51.000
Head's up.

39:57.083 --> 39:59.917
It's not broken but, man...

40:01.208 --> 40:04.500
Lie down.
Let me get you some ice.

40:04.542 --> 40:05.750
Here.

40:19.083 --> 40:23.375
Hey. I'm here for you.

40:23.417 --> 40:28.083
Whatever it is,
whatever you need, I'm here.

40:45.250 --> 40:47.333
Addison.
Yeah?

40:47.375 --> 40:50.000
Can I ask you a question?
ADDISON: Sure.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.041
SAM:
Uh, heh...

40:53.083 --> 40:55.542
What do you think
my biggest flaw is?

40:55.583 --> 40:57.333
What?

40:57.375 --> 41:00.542
It was just something
I'm thinking about.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.542
Other than the fact that
you don't wanna have a baby?

41:02.583 --> 41:05.041
Uh-huh.
Um...

41:05.083 --> 41:08.041
Well, let's see.

41:08.083 --> 41:11.125
You know, you don't recognize
how great you truly are.

41:11.166 --> 41:13.375
I'm serious.
You're kind of the perfect man,

41:13.417 --> 41:15.709
but you just
judge yourself so harshly

41:15.750 --> 41:18.458
and kind of hold yourself to
this impossibly high standard.

41:18.500 --> 41:22.750
You gotta learn how
to just relax a little.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.375
And for the record,
that is not your only flaw.

41:26.417 --> 41:28.667
It's just your biggest.

41:28.709 --> 41:30.291
( chuckles )

41:38.542 --> 41:40.208
Addie.
Yes.

41:40.250 --> 41:44.375
JAKE:
I took a chance
and guessed you were

41:44.417 --> 41:46.542
a "beer out of a bottle"
kind of girl.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.583
ADDISON:
Sam, what were you gonna ask me?

41:48.625 --> 41:51.291
Uh... Hey, man.

41:51.333 --> 41:52.583
Sam, you want a beer?

41:52.625 --> 41:55.542
No, no. I am good.

41:55.583 --> 41:57.000
I'll see you guys later.

41:57.041 --> 41:58.333
See you.
Yeah.

42:09.333 --> 42:12.041
Sometimes when we were stuck,
we'd stop for a minute to rest,

42:12.083 --> 42:14.041
regain our strength.

42:14.083 --> 42:18.458
You know, let the waves
take us for a while.

42:18.500 --> 42:23.834
Even if we weren't going
anywhere, it was still sailing.

42:28.083 --> 42:30.000
( mellow theme playing )
