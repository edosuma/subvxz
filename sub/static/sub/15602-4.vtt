00:02.657 --> 00:05.657
<b>1x04 - Into the Abyss</b>

00:07.658 --> 00:09.993
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:10.061 --> 00:13.030
You proud of what you did?
Answer me!

00:13.097 --> 00:15.165
Easy there, Kilowog.

00:15.233 --> 00:19.503
We just got our butts
saved by a Red Lantern.

00:19.570 --> 00:21.238
He's comin with us.

00:21.376 --> 00:23.881
<i>sync, correction by f1nc0
- - Addic7ed.com - -</i>

00:36.254 --> 00:38.388
Grub time!

00:47.298 --> 00:48.999
You got a problem, poozer?

00:49.067 --> 00:52.836
Only that I dislike
clumsy 7-foot pigs.

00:56.674 --> 00:57.774
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:57.842 --> 01:00.210
Kilowog, break it up.
You, too, Razer.

01:00.278 --> 01:01.778
What did I say about
killing each other?

01:01.846 --> 01:04.114
Come on, Hal.
We're just fooling around.

01:04.182 --> 01:05.782
Right?

01:05.850 --> 01:07.884
The ship's too small
for this nonsense.

01:07.952 --> 01:09.719
I want you two to shake hands.

01:09.787 --> 01:12.956
It's an Earth custom to show
there's no hard feelings.

01:13.024 --> 01:15.092
Come on. Shake hands.

01:17.428 --> 01:19.062
Not like that.

01:19.130 --> 01:22.699
<i>Attention,
incoming distress call.</i>

01:22.767 --> 01:25.802
<i>This is captain Goray of
the container ship Truvedon.</i>

01:25.870 --> 01:28.972
<i>I've struck a pinhole
and unable to proceed.</i>

01:29.040 --> 01:30.640
<i>One of my engines has failed.</i>

01:30.708 --> 01:34.044
<i>The other is at full power,
but it's just slowing the inevitable.</i>

01:34.112 --> 01:35.212
<i>I need help.</i>

01:35.279 --> 01:38.782
Aya, hold the transmission.
Could be a trap, Hal.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.317
We get there,
the disabled ship opens up,

01:40.384 --> 01:42.085
and the Reds start pouring out.

01:42.153 --> 01:44.688
There are no Red Lanterns
in this sector.

01:44.755 --> 01:47.691
- It's not a trap.
- How do you know?

01:47.758 --> 01:50.026
I was in charge of
setting those traps.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.231
This is Hal Jordan of
the Green Lantern corps.

01:54.298 --> 01:57.100
Sit tight, Truvedon.
We're on our way.

02:02.874 --> 02:06.610
I've got two questions:
"A" How far are we from that pinhole?

02:06.677 --> 02:08.878
<i>1.8 teraquads and closing.</i>

02:08.946 --> 02:11.982
Which brings me to "B."
What's a pinhole?

02:12.049 --> 02:13.717
It's a microscopic
black hole at the center

02:13.784 --> 02:15.318
of a whirlpool of energy.

02:15.386 --> 02:17.120
The closer that ship
gets to the pinhole,

02:17.188 --> 02:18.955
the stronger gravity becomes.

02:39.610 --> 02:40.810
That's close enough, Aya.

02:40.878 --> 02:43.580
We don't want to get pulled in, too.
Deploy the tractor beam.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.588
<i>Anomalous gravitational
readings are infecting my instruments.</i>

02:51.656 --> 02:52.856
<i>Unable to compensate.</i>

02:52.924 --> 02:54.724
Captain, do you have
any tow cables?

02:54.792 --> 02:56.593
Deploying them now.

03:01.453 --> 03:02.832
Missed.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.701
We'll have to go out
there and attach them to

03:04.769 --> 03:06.970
the interceptor manually.

03:07.038 --> 03:10.140
Anomalous gravity always
puts a bug in my britches.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.175
If you don't think
you're up to the task...

03:12.243 --> 03:14.044
Just try and keep up, punk.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.179
Green Lanterns train
in variable gravity.

03:16.247 --> 03:18.715
Let's see how you fly
when you 1,000 kilos,

03:18.783 --> 03:21.017
then 6,000, then 2,000.

03:21.085 --> 03:23.253
<i>This is
a dangerous undertaking.</i>

03:23.321 --> 03:26.022
<i>Why are we risking
3 lives to save one?</i>

03:26.090 --> 03:27.824
A Green Lantern protects
innocent life even

03:27.892 --> 03:32.729
at the risk of their own.
That's what we do.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.297
<i>Oh.</i>

03:36.934 --> 03:39.803
Quite... a downdraft!

03:39.870 --> 03:41.671
That's downdraw.

03:41.739 --> 03:45.809
You don't make it over the gravity
whirlpool, you're dark matter.

04:16.641 --> 04:19.075
All right, Aya!
Let's haul this baby out.

04:19.142 --> 04:21.810
<i>Warning. Gravitational
pull is too intense.</i>

04:21.879 --> 04:24.814
<i>Cables cannot
withstand the strain.</i>

04:24.882 --> 04:26.983
The ship's stable for now,
but sooner or later,

04:27.051 --> 04:29.686
I'm telling you,
it's going in.

04:29.754 --> 04:31.655
We'll have to get
the captain ourselves.

04:55.813 --> 04:57.080
You could have
given him a hand.

04:57.148 --> 05:01.084
I don't need a recruit on
my 6 and especially not a Red recruit.

05:01.152 --> 05:02.152
<i>Down here!</i>

05:02.219 --> 05:03.586
Deal with it.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.857
Thank the grollmother
you're here!

05:07.925 --> 05:10.994
I'm at half power and have
no way to pull myself out.

05:11.062 --> 05:12.996
Exactly what
are you hauling?

05:13.064 --> 05:14.431
Some kind of eggs?

05:14.498 --> 05:16.166
Leave them. With
the refrigeration out,

05:16.233 --> 05:17.867
they're goning to
spoil anyway.

05:17.935 --> 05:19.703
Spoil? It's only
a matter of time

05:19.770 --> 05:21.404
before these things hatch.

05:21.472 --> 05:23.006
Hatch?

05:27.378 --> 05:29.946
I can't tell what kind
of creature's inside.

05:30.014 --> 05:34.017
Who cares? Only vermin
and insects hatch from eggs.

05:34.085 --> 05:38.722
- I hatched from an egg.
- My point exactly.

05:38.789 --> 05:41.157
Ease up.

05:41.225 --> 05:44.194
<i>The Truvedon's logs
identify them as Spegnarians.</i>

05:44.261 --> 05:46.730
<i>They are incredibly rare
ever since their planet was</i>

05:46.797 --> 05:48.865
<i>devastated by volcanic activity.</i>

05:48.933 --> 05:51.334
So these eggs are some
kind of last-ditch colony?

05:51.402 --> 05:52.902
I suppose so.

05:52.970 --> 05:54.904
I was paid to avoid
major shipping lanes.

05:54.972 --> 05:58.908
Well, you sure did that.
Change of plans.

05:58.976 --> 06:00.977
We're gonna rescue
every life form here.

06:01.045 --> 06:02.746
It's a waste of time.

06:02.813 --> 06:05.382
He's right.
The starboard engine's dead.

06:05.449 --> 06:09.686
Then we'll restart it.
I'll get the civilian clear.

06:09.754 --> 06:12.055
You're leaving me
with him?

06:12.123 --> 06:13.723
You two need
some bonding time.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.064
I heard of you Green Lanterns.

06:21.132 --> 06:24.834
I know you're brave and all,
but you're crazy to go back.

06:24.902 --> 06:27.270
Brave, crazy... it's a fine line.

06:27.338 --> 06:30.273
<i>Green Lantern Hal Jordan,
I have several suggestions to</i>

06:30.341 --> 06:33.376
<i>conserve energy until
the inoperative engine is repaired.</i>

06:33.444 --> 06:35.779
Yeah. That's great, Aya.
Keep us out of the crush zone

06:35.846 --> 06:39.315
for as long as you can.

06:39.383 --> 06:41.317
<i>He must not have heard me.</i>

06:43.988 --> 06:45.288
Engine room's this way.

06:45.356 --> 06:49.259
This way.
That's the main power line.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.728
As if you know how
a cargo ship works.

06:51.796 --> 06:53.863
It's not some Red Lantern
death ride made ou

06:53.931 --> 06:57.434
of lead foil and scrap wire.
And stay in front of me.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.541
How's that phony
ring holding up?

07:04.608 --> 07:08.111
Without a Red Lantern battery,
eventually its charge will die.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.079
Huh. Sooner the better.

07:10.147 --> 07:15.118
But for now as long as I feel rage,
it's as strong as yours.

07:17.555 --> 07:21.157
Whoa!

07:22.460 --> 07:26.262
I hope you're good at maakila.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.931
That wasn't me.

07:27.998 --> 07:30.133
This ship is falling to pieces,
and I'm sick of your

07:30.201 --> 07:32.702
self-righteous braying,
you fat, green oaf!

07:37.341 --> 07:38.575
Aah!

07:58.529 --> 08:01.464
You kids stop that now, or I'm turning
this ship right around.

08:01.532 --> 08:04.067
Isn't that exactly
what we're trying to do?

08:04.134 --> 08:06.970
Try something like that
again, and I'm blowing

08:07.037 --> 08:10.406
my ring charge on you,
pinhole or no pinhole.

08:10.474 --> 08:11.908
I'm not afraid to die.

08:13.377 --> 08:15.812
You should be.
You'll live longer.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.426
Hello? Can you hear me?

08:30.494 --> 08:33.429
<i>Start the engine now,
or both ships are going in.</i>

08:33.496 --> 08:36.032
Goray, why is
the computer offline?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.601
Aya, are you there?
Aya!

08:38.669 --> 08:39.903
<i>What happened to her?</i>

08:39.970 --> 08:42.639
I don't care!
We're out of time!

08:49.146 --> 08:51.347
Wait, captain.
Ease off that winch.

09:05.362 --> 09:06.796
We're going in!

09:16.280 --> 09:18.981
The pinhole's overpowering
the ship's autograv.

09:19.049 --> 09:20.316
Hold on!

10:00.491 --> 10:02.225
There.
It's braced for now.

10:02.292 --> 10:04.494
But we're on the lip,
almost in the crush zone.

10:04.561 --> 10:08.364
- Let's get out of here.
- Not without the eggs.

10:11.301 --> 10:13.402
Where are you going?

10:13.470 --> 10:15.271
To buy us some time.

10:39.596 --> 10:42.999
I'll keep you out of
the hole as long as I can.

10:43.066 --> 10:46.803
Fix that engine, and,
Jordan, watch your back.

10:50.474 --> 10:54.544
It's hopeless. Kilowog's a fool!
He'll die out there.

11:28.545 --> 11:32.548
You see that?
The eggs are hatching.

11:32.616 --> 11:34.584
Let's keep moving.

11:41.692 --> 11:43.559
They're eating
the power lines!

11:48.065 --> 11:50.266
My constructs don't
even slow them down.

11:53.704 --> 11:54.737
Mine do.

11:54.805 --> 11:56.172
Hey, hey, hey.
Remember?

11:56.240 --> 11:59.508
Incredibly rare species?

11:59.576 --> 12:01.210
What's the hold up in there?

12:01.278 --> 12:04.146
Hatchlings. They're eating
through the power cables.

12:04.214 --> 12:06.549
Don't stop unless you
want to get a lot thinner.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.665
Navigation. Hello?

12:22.733 --> 12:24.667
<i>Hello?
Is anybody out there?</i>

12:24.735 --> 12:27.236
Goray, you're alive.

12:27.304 --> 12:29.138
Tell Aya to bring
the ship closer.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.108
Ring's almost empty.
I need her to spell me.

12:32.175 --> 12:35.745
Your nav computer must
be damaged, not responding,

12:35.812 --> 12:37.613
but I'll help.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.457
Oh.

12:52.729 --> 12:55.598
Ooh! Better not
touch that again.

12:55.666 --> 12:57.366
Oh, great!

13:07.110 --> 13:08.611
They're moving past us.

13:08.679 --> 13:13.149
If they start eating the engine
before we get there, it's over.

13:13.216 --> 13:14.884
We need a shortcut.

13:18.588 --> 13:20.289
It's less cluttered
out here.

13:20.357 --> 13:23.759
Yes. We'll have a nice, clear
plummet into the pinhole.

13:39.609 --> 13:40.843
How you doing, buddy?

13:48.819 --> 13:50.419
Razer!

14:08.338 --> 14:09.839
More hatchlings.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.642
We're already outnumbered.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.812
Think of how bad it will be once
the rest of the eggs open.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.447
Look. I have no problem
bringing a Red Lantern onto

14:18.515 --> 14:21.717
the team, but I will not
tolerate pessimists.

14:32.129 --> 14:35.264
- They've doomed us all.
- What now?

14:35.332 --> 14:39.535
This engine isn't just offline.
It's frozen solid.

14:39.603 --> 14:41.537
Those alien hatchlings ate
through the lines

14:41.605 --> 14:43.839
that power the heaters!

14:43.907 --> 14:45.875
It would take a team
of engineers to restart it

14:45.942 --> 14:49.211
before we collapse
into the pinhole.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.981
We don't have a team
of engineers or time.

15:06.316 --> 15:08.217
Razer, let's light this candle.

15:08.285 --> 15:10.453
You want us to fire a frozen engine?

15:10.520 --> 15:13.456
The explosion will be spectacular.

15:13.523 --> 15:15.224
He's right, Hal.

15:15.292 --> 15:18.160
If we start going in, Kilowog,
I want you to cut us loose.

15:18.228 --> 15:19.361
Not happening.

15:19.429 --> 15:22.264
You go, we all go,
and the worst part is

15:22.332 --> 15:24.133
that the captain
who can't fly straight

15:24.201 --> 15:27.636
gets to keep the interceptor.

15:27.704 --> 15:29.338
Your stubborn friend is right.

15:29.406 --> 15:35.077
I can't fix this, not without
another 5 pairs of hands.

15:35.145 --> 15:36.579
We're not giving up.

15:36.646 --> 15:38.547
Yell about the unfairness
of it all afterward.

15:38.615 --> 15:40.249
Then we'll go down fighting.

15:40.317 --> 15:42.885
At least my Red energy
makes a dent in them.

15:42.953 --> 15:45.821
That's right. Green energy
doesn't affect them.

15:51.094 --> 15:54.663
Wait, stop. Maybe I can get
you those 10 hands, Razer.

15:58.535 --> 15:59.902
What are you doing?

15:59.970 --> 16:01.370
Those things didn't
come from the eggs.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.005
They came from the interceptor.

16:03.073 --> 16:05.307
- They're Aya.
- You're deranged.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.443
Aya's been gone since
before the bugs showed up.

16:07.511 --> 16:09.945
Somehow she must have put
herself into these little bots

16:10.013 --> 16:11.280
and snuck on board.

16:11.348 --> 16:13.249
But they ate the power lines.

16:13.316 --> 16:16.719
She was shutting down nonessential
systems to save power.

16:42.245 --> 16:45.481
- Both engines are up.
- Aya, full reverse!

16:59.029 --> 17:03.165
Even with the engines back online,
we're past the point of no return.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.233
I live past the point
of no return.

17:05.301 --> 17:07.670
Express elevator going down.

17:28.425 --> 17:31.727
Not a bad shot for a Red.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.084
It's no use!

17:55.151 --> 17:57.319
We don't have enough
power to pull away!

17:57.387 --> 17:58.988
I'm not trying to pull away.

17:59.055 --> 18:00.689
I'm gonna fly this baby
right at it.

18:00.757 --> 18:02.358
You're going to what?

18:02.425 --> 18:04.226
If I can fly with
the current of the pinhole,

18:04.294 --> 18:05.561
maybe I can generate
enough velocity

18:05.629 --> 18:07.463
to slingshot us out of here.

18:33.256 --> 18:35.624
Come on. Hold together.

18:48.405 --> 18:51.307
Yeah, baby!
Still got it.

19:13.129 --> 19:16.632
Well, what do you know?
So that's my cargo.

19:16.700 --> 19:20.436
Cargo, huh?
Look at you.

19:20.503 --> 19:22.771
There's a few more
of these rascals running

19:22.839 --> 19:24.740
around that tub of yours.

19:27.777 --> 19:30.379
And to think, I was
going to abandon them.

19:49.399 --> 19:52.735
You were foolishly brave today.

19:52.802 --> 19:58.507
Yeah. Well, back at you.
Nice job saving me.

19:58.575 --> 20:01.343
Thanks.

20:01.411 --> 20:02.678
And thank you, Aya.

20:02.746 --> 20:04.546
We'd all be feeling pretty
cramped right now

20:04.614 --> 20:06.248
if it wasn't for you coming out
of your shell like that.

20:06.316 --> 20:08.584
<i>Yes, like a hatchling from an egg.</i>

20:08.651 --> 20:09.918
I'm not done.

20:09.986 --> 20:12.221
It was dangerous to up
and leave your post.

20:12.288 --> 20:14.223
We need to set a few
parameters, young lady.

20:14.290 --> 20:16.558
<i>A Green Lantern protects
innocent life, even</i>

20:16.626 --> 20:18.827
<i>at the risk of their own, correct?</i>

20:18.895 --> 20:20.329
Wait. Wait a minute.

20:20.397 --> 20:22.631
Aya, you do understand
you're a navcom,

20:22.699 --> 20:26.335
not a Green Lantern, right?
You can't be a GL.

20:26.403 --> 20:27.770
<i>Why not?</i>

20:27.837 --> 20:30.372
Well, first off,
the ring's got to pick you.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.408
- Why?
- Help me out.

20:32.475 --> 20:33.876
Oh, no. No.
I want to hear this.

20:33.943 --> 20:36.645
- Red?
- Leave me out of it.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.615
Look. Green Lanterns
positively got to have

20:39.682 --> 20:43.419
a physical body to walk around
and interact with people,

20:43.486 --> 20:45.788
not a bunch of creepy bugs.

20:45.855 --> 20:47.723
<i>Parameters set.</i>

21:05.608 --> 21:09.445
<i>A body like this?</i>

21:13.697 --> 21:16.664
