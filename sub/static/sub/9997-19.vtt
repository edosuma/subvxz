01:04.340 --> 01:05.910
What was that?
I think it was Marie.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.920
What is it, sweetie? What's wrong?

01:11.220 --> 01:12.930
Daddy, Daddy,
there was a man out there.

01:13.190 --> 01:14.180
What? What?

01:16.800 --> 01:17.650
It's okay.

02:06.290 --> 02:07.940
The guy's name is Matt Mulhearn.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.270
Did you know him?

02:09.900 --> 02:10.560
Not really.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.530
I'd see him around
from time to time.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.720
I'd wave at him or his wife.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.850
Oh, my God, his wife, his kids.

02:16.180 --> 02:16.910
They're fine.

02:17.490 --> 02:18.850
Everyone except Mr. Mulhearn here

02:18.851 --> 02:20.960
was in Chandler with one
of the grandparents.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.500
Wife's on her way back now.

02:23.650 --> 02:24.720
This is the third

02:24.870 --> 02:26.980
home invasion murder
in the past month.

02:27.390 --> 02:29.620
The first two happened in
the Western Precinct so, uh,

02:29.910 --> 02:32.030
their homicide squad's
handling the investigation,

02:32.230 --> 02:34.470
but this matches the M.O. Exactly.

02:35.810 --> 02:37.270
Someone pried open the back door,

02:37.870 --> 02:40.270
forced your neighbor here
to open the family safe,

02:40.330 --> 02:42.180
and then put a bullet
in the back of his head.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.080
I know. I dreamt it last night.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.880
Th-The last part of it anyway.

02:47.070 --> 02:48.890
But you mean you didn't come
all the way out here to say hi?

02:50.680 --> 02:53.390
So, uh... give me a
description of the shooter.

02:54.150 --> 02:55.610
I can do one better than that.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.210
I can give you an eyewitness.

03:01.490 --> 03:03.000
Hey, Mommy, what happened?

03:03.080 --> 03:04.419
What's with all the
cop cars outside

03:04.420 --> 03:05.510
in the middle of the night?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.920
Our neighbors, the Mulhearns--

03:08.070 --> 03:09.580
somebody broke into their house.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.510
Are they okay?

03:12.630 --> 03:14.300
Well, it could have been worse.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.040
Only Mr. Mulhearn was home.

03:18.630 --> 03:19.450
Sweetie--

03:20.630 --> 03:23.249
honey, the police are going to
want to talk to you tomorrow

03:23.250 --> 03:24.320
about that man that you saw.

03:25.070 --> 03:26.460
Is he going to come back?

03:26.500 --> 03:27.760
No, honey.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.370
The people that I work with,
they're going to catch him.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.870
They're going to put him in jail.

03:32.850 --> 03:35.890
Okay, but can I please sleep
with you guys tonight?

03:35.990 --> 03:36.750
Of course you can.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.950
Wait a second. Well,
then who's going to sleep with me?

03:44.850 --> 03:46.550
Remember how when we
first moved in here,

03:52.840 --> 03:54.000
I'll call tomorrow.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.990
I'm interested in Southfork

03:57.060 --> 03:59.140
because it combines the
advantages of a small school

03:59.310 --> 04:01.500
with the benefits of a
large public university.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.660
The ratio of teachers
to students is low,

04:03.790 --> 04:05.720
which is something I'm
definitely looking for.

04:08.150 --> 04:08.930
Okay.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.370
What do you think?

04:10.700 --> 04:12.290
Does it sound weird
talking about ratios?

04:12.350 --> 04:14.090
Maybe I should just say, like,
"Class sizes" Or something.

04:14.890 --> 04:15.830
I don't think it matters.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.440
I mean, you already
rocked your SATs.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.079
You really think this
interview is that important?

04:19.310 --> 04:20.980
It's for Southfork.

04:21.140 --> 04:23.300
I mean, they're sending someone
all the way down here to do it.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.510
World themes is calling.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.950
You ever read Beowulf? Uh-uh.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.110
Yeah, me either, and I'm
about to have a test on it.

04:32.300 --> 04:32.910
Later.

04:32.970 --> 04:33.670
Good luck.

04:40.190 --> 04:41.250
Southfork, huh?

04:42.060 --> 04:42.990
That's a good school.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.960
Tough to get into, though.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.340
That's what I hear.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.860
Did you know that less than
ten percent of the people

04:50.870 --> 04:53.460
who applied there last year got in?

04:53.540 --> 04:55.080
Those are brutal odds.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.900
Excuse me, do you work here?

04:58.460 --> 05:00.560
Are you a-a teacher or something?

05:00.570 --> 05:01.400
No.

05:02.330 --> 05:03.840
Okay, so then what
are you doing here?

05:04.260 --> 05:06.000
Why are you hanging around
a high school library?

05:07.780 --> 05:09.540
People are trying to study.

05:09.710 --> 05:13.000
Oh, don't worry,
nobody can hear us. Honest.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.340
Honest!

05:19.610 --> 05:20.290
You're...

05:20.370 --> 05:21.240
Yeah, as a doornail.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.960
Almost three months now.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.110
Heart attack.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.560
Tenth mile of a training run.

05:26.150 --> 05:29.130
My name is Alan Hahn, Dr.
Alan Hahn.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.539
I was a... A professor of
romantic literature at Southfork.

05:33.540 --> 05:34.470
Tenured professor.

05:35.090 --> 05:36.610
Head of the department actually.

05:37.910 --> 05:38.570
Okay.

05:38.940 --> 05:42.560
Well, then it's, um, it's really
nice to meet you, I guess.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.920
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

05:45.810 --> 05:49.280
GIRL : Rhonda,
Rhonda... RHONDA: I'm sorry.

05:51.570 --> 05:52.310
Ariel...

05:53.220 --> 05:55.420
I think I can help you
get into Southfork.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.679
In fact, I can
pretty much guarantee

05:57.680 --> 05:59.120
that you'll get into Southfork.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.370
Really?

06:01.640 --> 06:02.380
Mm-hmm.

06:02.980 --> 06:04.590
How can you be so sure?

06:04.970 --> 06:07.550
Well, when I was alive,
I was married to a woman

06:07.720 --> 06:10.140
named Sondra Hahn-Barker.

06:11.110 --> 06:11.990
Sound familiar?

06:12.580 --> 06:15.070
She's interviewing me tomorrow.

06:15.080 --> 06:15.750
Mm-hmm.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.260
Yes, Sondra is a very
successful attorney.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.260
She's one of Southfork's
must active alumni.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.410
She's on the board of directors.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.830
She's raised god knows how
much money for that place

06:23.831 --> 06:25.749
If you get her stamp of approval,

06:25.750 --> 06:27.580
you are in-
it's as simple as that.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.219
And I can tell you
exactly how to do it.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.160
If you listen to me,

06:31.161 --> 06:34.200
you will give the interview
of Sondra's life,

06:34.570 --> 06:37.040
'cause I know just
what she wants to hear.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.330
Okay, but...

06:42.240 --> 06:43.920
Why would you do that for me?

06:46.650 --> 06:48.900
A very good and canny question.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.490
It is, after all,
a rather large favor.

06:51.550 --> 06:53.840
In return for which,
I'm asking only a small one.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.990
At the interview,
Sondra will have a laptop.

06:57.040 --> 06:57.910
It was mine.

06:58.010 --> 07:01.160
There's a file on there
I'd rather she not see.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.250
When an opportunity
presents itself--

07:03.290 --> 07:04.290
and I know that one will--

07:04.350 --> 07:07.030
all you have to do is
just delete the file.

07:09.010 --> 07:09.620
How do you know

07:09.660 --> 07:11.410
that she'll leave me
alone with that computer?

07:11.760 --> 07:13.100
Oh, the same way I know

07:13.140 --> 07:15.980
that you're going to pass this
interview with flying colors.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.750
Yes, it's one of the few perks
of my current condition.

07:19.210 --> 07:20.290
What else do you need to know?

07:21.960 --> 07:24.080
What's on this file that
you want me to delete?

07:26.720 --> 07:27.800
Uh, it's personal.

07:28.370 --> 07:29.540
It's, uh, no big deal.

07:29.590 --> 07:31.620
It's just-- it's embarrassing.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.620
Honestly, there's just some, uh,

07:35.760 --> 07:39.330
material I'd rather, you know,
my wife not know about.

07:41.610 --> 07:43.860
Some Web sites I was
visiting, you know.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.190
I think you-you understand
what I'm talking about.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.990
Yeah, I got the idea.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.470
AUTOMATED VOICE: Hello.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.380
Your security system is
ready for activation.

07:55.710 --> 07:57.030
Cool. It talks.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.130
Sure does. The 2100 will even react

07:59.180 --> 08:00.410
to the sound of your voice,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.750
if your hands are full and
you can't punch in your code.

08:03.390 --> 08:04.420
Okay, um...

08:06.570 --> 08:08.700
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
security system is armed.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.960
Once it's armed,
and the sensor's been tripped,

08:14.040 --> 08:15.800
you have 20 seconds to turn it off

08:16.120 --> 08:18.070
before the alarm goes off.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.750
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
security system is disarmed.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.950
What else does it say?

08:25.270 --> 08:25.990
Excuse me?

08:26.230 --> 08:26.920
The alarm.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.530
What else does it say?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.180
Uh, pretty much just "
Armed" And "Disarmed."

08:31.330 --> 08:32.570
I can set it up to tell you

08:32.630 --> 08:34.590
which alarm sensor's
been tripped if you want.

08:34.909 --> 08:35.970
Can it say our name?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.510
Not quite there yet.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.049
Maybe next year's model.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.690
All right, well, the alarm is set.

08:42.740 --> 08:45.080
Don't open a window unless
you want the police here.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.100
Good to know.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.820
You've been, uh,
in there for 45 minutes.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.010
What have you been doing?

08:51.300 --> 08:53.760
I was making the Mulhearns lasagna.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.230
I'm going to drop it
off in the morning.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.320
Oh, that poor woman.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.140
I think her name is Amy.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.970
I can't even imagine what
she's dealing with right now.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.730
Losing her husband
suddenly like that?

09:05.870 --> 09:06.620
Mommy?

09:07.490 --> 09:08.620
I can't get tired.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.090
I'm still too scared.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.350
You know we've got an alarm now,
sweetie, right?

09:12.570 --> 09:13.890
It's on and everything.

09:14.010 --> 09:14.760
I know.

09:15.410 --> 09:16.890
You want to sleep
with us again tonight?

09:17.060 --> 09:18.950
Hmm? All right.

09:19.070 --> 09:20.210
Come on, you little one.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.270
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
security system is armed.

09:31.390 --> 09:34.020
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
security system is disarmed.

09:36.350 --> 09:39.100
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
security system is armed.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.100
AUTOMATED VOICE: It's
all right, Marie.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.650
The house is safe.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.540
You heard me. I said you're safe.

09:47.590 --> 09:48.550
You could talk?

09:48.670 --> 09:49.940
I sure can, Marie.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.380
My name's Sal,
and I'm here to protect you.

09:53.470 --> 09:57.720
And I hope that you and I are
going to be very good friends.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.020
Oh. Hi.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.570
Allison, right?

10:08.550 --> 10:10.260
Um, I hope I'm not intruding.

10:11.490 --> 10:12.210
Thank you.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.640
Everyone's been so kind.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.600
I can't tell you how
much we appreciate it.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.190
Um, would you like to come inside?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.830
Another neighbor
brought a deli tray by.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.910
I-I made coffee.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.400
Well, I would love to.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.170
I'm, I'm just a
little late for work.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.380
Um, another time?

10:29.770 --> 10:30.520
Okay.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.480
I've actually got to get going,
too, Amy. Oh.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.090
Okay. Um... Allison,

10:35.140 --> 10:37.790
have you ever met Josh Berryman?

10:37.830 --> 10:39.040
He lives right around the corner.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.740
Hate that we're meeting
'cause of this,

10:47.850 --> 10:50.110
but, uh, it's always nice
to meet your neighbors.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.470
Take care, Amy.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.270
Bye.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.630
Berryman worked as a
software consultant

11:02.640 --> 11:05.009
until his company went under;
That was about two years ago.

11:05.010 --> 11:06.689
Wife filed for divorce
ten months ago.

11:06.690 --> 11:08.590
Mortgage is eight
months in arrears.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.839
Does he have an alibi for the night

11:09.840 --> 11:10.810
of the Mulhearn murder?

11:11.160 --> 11:12.249
Nope. Doesn't have one

11:12.250 --> 11:13.750
for the nights of the
other two murders, either.

11:14.060 --> 11:15.950
Way Berryman tells it,
he spends most nights

11:16.400 --> 11:18.230
watching TV at home
by his lonesome.

11:20.090 --> 11:22.630
Still and all, I know this
guy's broke, but, uh...

11:23.980 --> 11:25.660
He just doesn't strike
me as the home-invading,

11:25.710 --> 11:27.390
execution-style-murdering type.

11:28.420 --> 11:28.980
It's him.

11:29.030 --> 11:29.730
He did it.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.760
He's the man I saw.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.870
Well, there's one way
to find out for sure.

11:36.590 --> 11:37.220
You ready?

11:47.460 --> 11:49.560
Okay, Marie, you see all
those men in the room there?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.690
Let me tell you a secret.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.970
You can see them,
but they can't see you.

11:55.640 --> 11:56.370
Okay?

11:57.850 --> 11:58.710
So all you have to do is

11:58.711 --> 12:01.580
point out the man that you saw
running through your backyard,

12:01.630 --> 12:03.170
and the police here will
take care of the rest.

12:03.810 --> 12:04.520
All right?

12:05.050 --> 12:05.890
All right. Good.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.840
So, do you see him?

12:31.320 --> 12:32.130
No.

12:33.470 --> 12:34.390
Are you sure, sweetie?

12:34.430 --> 12:36.110
Maybe you want to
take another look?

12:36.370 --> 12:38.200
No, I don't think I remember.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.070
Marie, sweetie,
that man can't see you.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.660
You have nothing to be afraid of.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.510
No, I don't remember
his face, Mommy.

12:45.660 --> 12:46.480
I'm sorry.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.200
But, honey,
you looked right at him.

12:48.510 --> 12:49.320
Al.

12:49.490 --> 12:50.960
She said she doesn't see him.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.570
...she really saw the guy?

12:56.590 --> 12:57.610
Well, she did her best.

12:57.670 --> 12:58.850
Can we do that again tomorrow?

12:59.470 --> 13:01.400
Look, I know Marie
saw that man's face.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.200
I just need a little
more time to talk to her.

13:03.370 --> 13:05.609
Aaaaa

13:05.610 --> 13:07.140
You mean nobody else
has come forward

13:07.180 --> 13:08.460
to say they saw him? SCANLON: No.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.940
And so far, forensics has nothing

13:09.990 --> 13:11.340
to tie him to the scene.

13:11.780 --> 13:12.650
So, without your daughter's I.D.,

13:12.710 --> 13:13.810
we got nothing on this guy.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.170
You can't just let him go.

13:15.550 --> 13:17.820
Allison, no one is
questioning what you saw.

13:17.830 --> 13:18.640
But there is simply

13:18.641 --> 13:20.850
not enough evidence to
justify holding him.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.060
He's a killer, sir.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.420
He lives down the
street from my family.

13:24.580 --> 13:25.870
From my daughters!

13:27.050 --> 13:27.570
All right.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.350
By law, I can hold him for 24
hours without charging him.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.690
But if we don't find enough
evidence between now and then...

13:32.860 --> 13:34.750
You have to let him go;
I understand.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.610
Those dorms, oh, my goodness.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.330
Which one is it-
the one that was built in 1842?

13:42.620 --> 13:43.930
Well, that's Whitman Hall.

13:44.420 --> 13:45.790
That's where I lived as a freshman.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.130
You did? You're kidding.

13:47.270 --> 13:47.890
No.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.150
Sorry.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.840
Oh, it's my office;
I'm going to have to take this.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.480
I thought I'd be done by now.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.410
I didn't expect to find
someone so engaging.

13:58.390 --> 13:59.730
Do you want me to wait outside?

13:59.870 --> 14:01.840
No, no. I'm gonna run to
the ladies' room after.

14:01.890 --> 14:02.770
This'll just take a sec.

14:04.030 --> 14:05.040
Hello, this is Sondra.

14:06.110 --> 14:06.690
Hi.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.430
That's your cue, kiddo.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.480
You got about 90 seconds.

14:32.850 --> 14:35.180
Are you sure this is the right
file you want me to delete?

14:35.470 --> 14:37.370
Stop looking at it and just do it.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.240
But I don't get it.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.810
Why do you want to delete
a bunch of baby photos?

14:44.990 --> 14:45.570
Oh.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.250
Happy now?

14:50.220 --> 14:51.070
Just do it.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.500
You were involved with this person.

14:57.700 --> 14:58.880
And you lied to me.

15:03.190 --> 15:03.950
You know what?

15:05.260 --> 15:06.750
I already nailed that interview.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.780
So I don't need to erase
any of this for you.

15:10.870 --> 15:13.500
Fine. If you think my wife's life,
or anyone's life,

15:13.560 --> 15:15.070
is gonna be made better by
looking at those pictures,

15:15.110 --> 15:16.090
go ahead, just leave them.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.340
But you've got eight
seconds to decide.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.530
Six.

15:23.160 --> 15:23.950
Four.

15:32.070 --> 15:33.840
All right, Ariel,
ready to dive back in?

15:34.490 --> 15:35.570
Absolutely.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.850
You did very well in there today.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.450
I think you're a lock.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.160
I just wanted to,
you know, check in,

15:50.260 --> 15:53.460
make sure you're not thinking
about doing anything rash.

15:54.090 --> 15:55.889
You mean you want to know
if I'm gonna tell your wife

15:55.890 --> 15:57.269
that you were involved
with another woman

15:57.270 --> 15:58.440
and had a baby with her?

15:59.510 --> 16:02.900
That's a bit presumptuous,
isn't it, Ariel?

16:02.970 --> 16:05.580
Y-You don't know
that that's my baby.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.360
Are you saying it isn't?

16:07.470 --> 16:08.300
I'm saying,

16:08.600 --> 16:10.550
the paternity of that child
has never been established.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.270
Not to my satisfaction.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.930
Not to your satisfaction?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.720
Is he your child, or isn't he?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.560
I don't know how to
answer that, Ariel.

16:18.630 --> 16:21.490
That is a mystery
which is now, sadly,

16:22.020 --> 16:23.940
lost to the sands of time.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.790
You know, the woman, uh,
you saw in those pictures--

16:28.030 --> 16:32.060
I wasn't the only person
she was dating at the time.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.990
Uh, Abby was a student of mine.

16:35.380 --> 16:39.250
A very, uh, uh, popular student.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.220
Okay, but in those photos,

16:41.840 --> 16:44.630
she obviously thought
that it was your child.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.650
You-you know what?
I'm not getting into this with you.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.740
Uh, have a wonderful life.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.320
Enjoy Southfork, hmm?

16:50.570 --> 16:54.290
Uh, and here comes my
wonderful widow Sondra.

17:07.150 --> 17:08.280
What's wrong, Marie?

17:08.490 --> 17:10.319
There's no reason to be scared.

17:10.540 --> 17:13.190
I told you I'd keep you safe.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.819
I can't help it.

17:15.339 --> 17:16.579
I understand.

17:17.030 --> 17:19.220
It's a dangerous world out there.

17:19.510 --> 17:22.780
That's why I'm here-
to keep you safe.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.220
To warn you about the bad guys,

17:25.520 --> 17:28.750
and to scare them away
if they come too close.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.320
And do you know why you're here?

17:33.600 --> 17:34.770
To help me.

17:35.410 --> 17:36.830
And that means

17:36.960 --> 17:39.010
you have to listen to what I say.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.040
You have to do what
I ask you to do.

17:42.510 --> 17:45.950
Because I'm the one in charge
of keeping everyone safe.

17:46.350 --> 17:49.240
You understand that...
right, Marie?

17:51.590 --> 17:54.010
That's easy to understand,
isn't it?

17:54.410 --> 17:57.440
You listen to me,
and everything is fine.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.070
You don't listen to me,

17:59.500 --> 18:02.050
and your whole family
dies in their beds.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.190
How's that sound?

18:31.590 --> 18:32.290
Marie?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.090
What are you doing?

18:36.620 --> 18:37.790
I couldn't sleep.

18:41.010 --> 18:42.420
Who were you talking to?

18:42.970 --> 18:43.730
No one.

18:46.770 --> 18:47.620
Are you sure?

18:51.050 --> 18:51.790
Come here.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.690
Honey, if anyone
ever threatened you,

19:02.460 --> 19:04.100
if anyone ever told you things

19:04.110 --> 19:05.760
to scare you about our family,

19:05.820 --> 19:07.110
you would tell me, right?

19:09.370 --> 19:11.560
You know Mommy works
with the police.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.850
I would get them to put
that person in jail.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.530
And even if it wasn't a person,

19:22.980 --> 19:24.260
you would still tell me, right?

19:26.950 --> 19:27.730
Because you know,

19:28.350 --> 19:31.030
I would never let anyone
or anything hurt you.

19:32.090 --> 19:33.300
You know that, right?

19:36.930 --> 19:37.740
Oh, honey...

19:41.500 --> 19:43.120
Were you talking to that alarm?

19:45.660 --> 19:47.160
Was the alarm talking to you?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.050
You can tell me.

19:48.310 --> 19:50.390
It talks when you turn it on.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.850
Well, I-I know that,
but other than that.

19:54.170 --> 19:56.690
Mommy, burglar alarms don't talk.

19:56.750 --> 19:57.660
Not really.

20:00.420 --> 20:03.230
I'm gonna go back to bed now, okay?

20:12.330 --> 20:14.940
Okay, so the burglar
alarm... is evil?

20:15.130 --> 20:17.010
No, Joe, that's not
what I'm saying.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.660
Not exactly.

20:19.270 --> 20:21.080
Okay. What are you saying exactly?

20:22.180 --> 20:24.180
I'm saying that in my dreams,

20:24.230 --> 20:25.770
this thing is talking
to our daughter,

20:25.820 --> 20:27.560
and I don't like what it's saying.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.020
And I know how that sounds,

20:30.540 --> 20:31.400
but I've seen it.

20:32.010 --> 20:32.970
I come in tonight.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.750
Marie is standing in
front of the alarm.

20:35.210 --> 20:36.260
And it's dark.

20:37.010 --> 20:39.590
But I'm pretty certain
that she was talking to it.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.500
Al, I'm having a hard time

20:44.640 --> 20:46.660
following you down the
rabbit hole on this one.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.780
I know this thing
seems pretty high-tech

20:49.840 --> 20:51.220
because it talks, but it's act...

20:51.230 --> 20:52.190
It's actually fairly simple.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.620
In terms of programming power,

20:53.720 --> 20:56.000
it's about as sophisticated
as the toaster oven.

20:56.460 --> 20:57.990
Smart people have
been experimenting

20:58.050 --> 21:00.990
with artificial intelligence
for decades now,

21:01.060 --> 21:03.440
but I doubt that anybody
has cracked the problem,

21:03.570 --> 21:06.230
snuck it into a burglar alarm
without telling anyone.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.140
Okay. Then why don't you
explain why I'm seeing this?

21:09.280 --> 21:10.950
The burden of proof is on me here?

21:11.190 --> 21:12.100
Yeah.

21:12.630 --> 21:13.980
Okay, fine.

21:14.630 --> 21:17.060
If I had to guess,
I would say that you are dreaming

21:17.120 --> 21:19.530
about what Marie is
seeing in her imagination.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.120
Kids sometimes respond to trauma

21:22.190 --> 21:24.240
by creating imaginary friends.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.840
Marie has been through a trauma,
and if she's getting comfort

21:28.050 --> 21:31.270
by giving the burglar
alarm a personality,

21:31.430 --> 21:33.740
by imagining it can
keep us all safe,

21:33.810 --> 21:35.100
why is that such a big deal?

21:35.230 --> 21:37.390
It's not comforting her,
it's threatening her!

21:37.610 --> 21:39.090
It's telling her that
we're all gonna die.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.120
And you know what? I don't
care if you can't explain it.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.780
I don't like it!

21:42.910 --> 21:44.390
I'm gonna call the
company tomorrow,

21:44.440 --> 21:45.430
and I'm gonna have
them take it out.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.920
Well, hold on a second, Al.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.990
We just spent $2,200 on this thing.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.730
I'm not saying we
won't have an alarm.

21:50.790 --> 21:53.050
I just want a different model;
One that doesn't talk.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.540
Your security system is armed.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.690
Who asked you?

23:04.990 --> 23:06.080
No!

23:41.340 --> 23:42.760
Allison, what can I do for you?

23:43.030 --> 23:45.270
Did I just see Josh
Berryman in here?

23:45.540 --> 23:46.420
You sure did.

23:46.630 --> 23:47.730
We released him this morning,

23:47.910 --> 23:48.860
so I asked him to come by

23:48.910 --> 23:50.510
so I could personally apologize

23:50.650 --> 23:52.830
for any inconvenience
or embarrassment...

23:52.910 --> 23:54.100
Apologize?

23:55.110 --> 23:57.100
You didn't see the paper
this morning, did you?

23:58.070 --> 24:00.720
There was another home invasion
last night in El Mirage.

24:00.770 --> 24:01.820
They cleaned out the safe

24:01.860 --> 24:03.750
and shot a retired couple
in the back of the head.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.720
Since Mr. Berryman was in
our custody last night,

24:05.770 --> 24:08.240
it seems unlikely
that he was involved.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.200
That, plus the utter paucity
of any evidence against him,

24:11.260 --> 24:13.940
well, there's really no
basis on which to hold him.

24:14.010 --> 24:14.930
But I saw him do it.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.320
That's all well and good.

24:16.550 --> 24:17.940
No, no, no, you're not hearing me.

24:18.530 --> 24:20.520
Obviously,
it wasn't him last night.

24:20.730 --> 24:22.670
I don't know if he committed
these other murders,

24:22.800 --> 24:24.280
but I know he killed my neighbor.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.400
I saw him do it.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.900
I can even tell you exactly
where the murder weapon is.

25:01.580 --> 25:02.430
What are you doing?

25:03.100 --> 25:04.130
I thought we had a deal.

25:05.140 --> 25:06.610
Yeah, I thought I was supposed

25:06.660 --> 25:07.930
to help you get rid of some porn.

25:08.450 --> 25:09.690
Yeah-- is this about the baby?

25:09.740 --> 25:11.520
Are you still upset about the baby?

25:11.570 --> 25:14.230
The paternity of that child
has never been established.

25:14.350 --> 25:15.940
All I know is that
that information was

25:15.980 --> 25:17.750
on your computer when you died.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.620
Okay, so maybe your wife
was supposed to find it.

25:19.660 --> 25:20.460
I'm not sure.

25:21.390 --> 25:23.770
I'm just sure that I was
never supposed to remove it.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.250
You think that's going
to make a difference?

25:25.290 --> 25:26.600
That kid is nothing to Sondra.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.440
My family's obligation to
that boy died when I did.

25:30.490 --> 25:31.950
Yeah, well, that's not
up to me to decide.

25:32.930 --> 25:33.790
And you don't know.

25:34.260 --> 25:35.670
Maybe she'll want to help.

25:37.390 --> 25:39.730
Y-You're talking about my wife?

25:39.760 --> 25:41.490
That woman sues
people for a living.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.430
She would personally kill the
last baby seal on the planet

25:44.490 --> 25:46.100
if she thought there was
a dollar in it for her.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.880
That, that kid is
nothing to Sondra.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.390
She'll do nothing for that kid.

25:49.510 --> 25:51.160
Maybe she will, maybe she won't.

25:51.470 --> 25:52.680
It's not up to me.

25:53.870 --> 25:55.070
You might as well stop talking

25:55.120 --> 25:57.920
because there is nothing
that you can do to stop me.

25:58.650 --> 25:59.400
Oh, I know that.

25:59.980 --> 26:01.000
I'm not trying to stop you.

26:01.050 --> 26:04.880
I'm just trying to, uh, delay you.

26:07.140 --> 26:07.830
Ariel.

26:09.910 --> 26:11.410
Mrs. Hahn-Barker.

26:11.930 --> 26:14.240
Uh, great, I've been
waiting for you.

26:14.550 --> 26:15.260
You have?

26:16.330 --> 26:17.590
Uh, yeah.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.800
Sorry, my, uh,

26:20.900 --> 26:23.440
my dad said that he'd,
uh, get me a laptop

26:23.490 --> 26:25.000
when I go to college, so,

26:25.560 --> 26:26.850
yeah, I just saw it lying here

26:27.040 --> 26:28.370
and, and wanted to check it out.

26:29.650 --> 26:30.720
I, uh, I got home the other day

26:30.790 --> 26:33.350
and realized that I wanted
to send you a thank-you note,

26:33.560 --> 26:37.620
uh, thanking you for taking
the trouble to interview me,

26:38.270 --> 26:40.230
uh, and then I realized
that I don't have

26:40.280 --> 26:42.480
a home or business
address to send it.

26:42.910 --> 26:44.750
That's completely unnecessary.

26:45.620 --> 26:46.990
Here's my card.

26:47.810 --> 26:48.780
Thanks.

26:50.880 --> 26:51.610
Ariel.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.010
You gave a great
interview the other day.

26:56.430 --> 26:58.160
Southfork is very
excited about you.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.420
Thank you.

27:04.130 --> 27:04.980
Bye.

27:09.420 --> 27:09.970
Hello.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.350
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know

27:11.400 --> 27:12.740
I'm right around the
corner from your place.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.840
I'd ask if I can stop by for dinner,
except I smell

27:14.900 --> 27:16.950
like I've been rooting
around in a sewer all day,

27:17.030 --> 27:18.320
which is exactly
what I've been doing.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.870
Tell me you found the gun.

27:20.670 --> 27:21.380
I wish I could.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.540
We searched that grate
you pointed out to us

27:23.590 --> 27:26.280
and then we poked our heads
down every manhole on the block.

27:26.370 --> 27:27.350
You'd be surprised
at some of the things

27:27.410 --> 27:28.710
your neighbors flush
down the toilet,

27:28.780 --> 27:29.800
but there's no gun down there.

27:30.130 --> 27:30.950
I don't understand.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.630
It was sitting there,
I saw it sitting there.

27:33.330 --> 27:34.410
I don't know what to
tell you, Allison.

27:34.460 --> 27:37.020
If there was a murder weapon
down there, it's gone.

29:03.770 --> 29:04.840
That's good, Marie.

29:05.420 --> 29:07.900
You're a very
cooperative little girl.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.110
Al, what the hell are
you doing out here?

29:20.360 --> 29:21.320
I'm looking for something.

29:21.590 --> 29:22.320
What?

29:24.110 --> 29:25.470
This. Whoa!

29:25.740 --> 29:27.260
This is the gun

29:27.370 --> 29:30.090
that Josh Berryman used
to kill Matt Mulhearn.

29:30.660 --> 29:31.930
I think Marie put it in here.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.390
I think tha-that alarm told her to.

29:38.350 --> 29:40.550
No, I didn't.
Marie, I know you did.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.790
I saw you put that
gun in the trash can.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.330
Look, honey, I'm not mad at you.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.110
I just want you to
tell me what happened.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.430
Don't look at that alarm,
you look at me.

29:50.710 --> 29:51.940
Look, I know you're scared.

29:51.970 --> 29:53.690
I know that thing has
been talking to you,

29:53.810 --> 29:55.080
but it cannot hurt you.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.310
It cannot hurt us.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.510
I need you to tell me
what it told you to do.

29:59.690 --> 30:00.860
You're scaring me, Mommy.

30:00.910 --> 30:02.880
Burglar alarms do not talk.

30:02.980 --> 30:05.060
Well, that one does,
and we both know it does.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.740
Okay, come on, Marie,
why don't you go back,

30:06.780 --> 30:07.960
see if you can get a
little more sleep?

30:08.440 --> 30:09.170
Joe!

30:11.160 --> 30:12.650
We will talk about
this later, okay?

30:12.700 --> 30:13.700
I'm sorry, Mommy.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.680
She's lying!

30:16.870 --> 30:18.580
This thing is making
my daughter lie to me!

30:20.260 --> 30:22.230
For God's sake,
are you listening to yourself?

30:22.820 --> 30:24.520
I am getting rid of
that thing right now.

30:25.070 --> 30:25.630
What are you talking about?

30:25.680 --> 30:27.720
They're coming to replace
it the day after tomorrow.

30:28.110 --> 30:29.520
Do you know how to
dismantle that thing?

30:29.570 --> 30:30.800
I can cut some wires.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.910
No. Okay, just do me a favor-
give it to me.

30:32.950 --> 30:33.610
If you're dead set on doing this,

30:33.680 --> 30:34.920
at least take advantage of the fact

30:35.010 --> 30:36.190
you're married to an engineer.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.660
And you do me a favor-
don't shock me or anything.

30:39.740 --> 30:40.520
Very funny.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.360
Just don't ask me where I found it.

30:46.380 --> 30:48.240
Am I allowed to ask you what it is?

30:48.620 --> 30:49.730
It's the gun that
Josh Berryman used

30:49.780 --> 30:50.860
to kill Matt Mulhearn.

30:51.090 --> 30:52.580
Look, I know another crime happened

30:52.640 --> 30:53.750
while he was in custody.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.710
I know you made nice
with the guy yesterday.

30:55.780 --> 30:58.480
Just run whatever
tests you need to.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.200
You'll see I'm right.

31:06.510 --> 31:07.180
Ariel.

31:09.690 --> 31:10.820
Mrs. Hahn-Barker.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.820
I thought you were, uh,
were heading home.

31:13.170 --> 31:15.250
I delayed my flight
for a couple of hours.

31:16.370 --> 31:18.090
I wanted to speak with
you about something.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.210
Uh... sure.

31:25.510 --> 31:27.820
I found a file on my
computer yesterday,

31:29.300 --> 31:30.810
and I think that you put it there.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.100
It's the only possibility
that makes any sense.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.310
Thank you for not
bothering to deny it.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.220
Do you know her?

31:44.500 --> 31:45.970
The young woman in the photos?

31:47.530 --> 31:50.160
No, I never met her.

31:51.830 --> 31:53.460
She said the same thing about you.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.250
I spoke with her.

31:58.790 --> 32:02.830
If, in fact, that young boy
is my late husband's son...

32:04.230 --> 32:05.660
I've decided to take
some of the money

32:05.740 --> 32:07.700
that Alan left behind
to provide for him.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.280
I'm glad.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.340
So if you didn't know the girl,

32:13.380 --> 32:14.560
then you must have known Alan.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.620
Putting that file on my
computer for me to find,

32:21.060 --> 32:23.430
I can only assume you had
some score to settle with him.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.480
I've learned an awful lot
about my late husband

32:28.550 --> 32:29.910
over the last 24 hours.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.560
I can't imagine what would
have brought you to Oregon

32:32.750 --> 32:33.820
or to Southfork.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.320
The summer program for high
schoolers, I'm guessing.

32:38.230 --> 32:39.340
So which one of his lectures

32:39.390 --> 32:41.420
on romantic literature
reeled you in?

32:41.680 --> 32:43.060
Sense and Sensibility?

32:44.260 --> 32:45.160
The Lady of the Lake?

32:45.200 --> 32:46.770
That was always one
of my favorites.

32:47.000 --> 32:47.990
The Scarlet Letter?

32:48.890 --> 32:50.350
No, I've never been to Oregon.

32:51.550 --> 32:53.750
I have never heard your
late husband's lecture.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.650
And I swear that I never
met him while he was alive.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.720
You what want to know what
should have been my first clue?

33:02.260 --> 33:03.160
Your interview.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.880
All those carefully
polished answers.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.200
You sounded exactly like him.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.230
It is a shame.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.080
I liked you.

33:14.580 --> 33:17.460
I actually felt good
about championing you

33:17.520 --> 33:19.260
to the Director of Admissions.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.240
Well... I have a plane to catch.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.000
Stop that.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.020
You brought this on yourself.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.730
You didn't need to get
involved with him.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.070
You didn't need his help.

33:37.790 --> 33:38.850
No.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.460
You're a smart girl.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.530
You're going to get into
some wonderful school.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.390
Just not this one.

34:10.610 --> 34:13.739
Why did you guys rip the
alarm off of the wall?

34:14.429 --> 34:15.750
You want to field that one, dear?

34:17.060 --> 34:18.290
It wasn't working right.

34:19.170 --> 34:20.280
O-Kay.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.360
But why isn't Marie
coming out of our room?

34:23.699 --> 34:25.280
I think she misses the alarm.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.100
Okay.

34:28.000 --> 34:28.940
Go get your sisters.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.230
I know Marie's in mourning,
but she still has to eat.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.290
Hello?

34:36.409 --> 34:37.130
Allison.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.239
I'm sorry I didn't get back
to you before you left.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.110
I wanted you to
know you were right.

34:42.650 --> 34:44.150
According to Forensics,

34:44.310 --> 34:46.889
that gun you brought in was
used to execute Matt Mulhearn.

34:46.989 --> 34:48.429
Sir, that's great news.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.020
I'm not finished.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.139
Now, we can tie the
weapon to the murder,

34:53.400 --> 34:55.900
but not to the man you
believe pulled the trigger.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.530
I'm afraid that the gun was
wiped clean of fingerprints

34:58.580 --> 34:59.880
before you brought it in.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.990
Also, the serial
number was filed away,

35:03.040 --> 35:04.310
so there's no way to trace it.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.260
Bottom line is,

35:05.350 --> 35:07.830
we simply cannot connect it
to Josh Berryman in any way.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.780
So he just gets away with it?

35:10.220 --> 35:12.480
In the absence of further
developments, I'm afraid so.

35:12.790 --> 35:16.350
Look, I know this hits you
quite literally close to home,

35:16.820 --> 35:18.460
and I want you to
know how sorry I am.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.630
I understand, sir.

35:20.750 --> 35:21.430
Thank you.

35:24.910 --> 35:26.690
So, I-I did like you told me.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.540
I-I went to the bar in Avondale,

35:28.550 --> 35:32.630
and I bought this from a guy who
deals drugs in the parking lot.

35:33.160 --> 35:36.200
And, um, I went to the bank.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.520
Um, I-I got a safe deposit box.

35:39.650 --> 35:41.070
But, you know, don't-don't worry,

35:41.160 --> 35:43.390
because I-I-I won't spend it

35:43.440 --> 35:45.080
till a couple months
after the job's done.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.440
But, uh...

35:50.170 --> 35:51.300
You got the money, right?

36:09.040 --> 36:11.220
I guess it's really gonna happen,
I guess. I'm actually...

36:12.100 --> 36:13.260
Gonna kill someone.

36:18.740 --> 36:19.550
Hey.

36:19.910 --> 36:20.560
Listen.

36:22.810 --> 36:23.620
Calm down.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.510
It's going to be fine.

36:28.530 --> 36:29.430
Just be sure you...

36:31.190 --> 36:32.640
Shoot me in the back of the head.

36:33.730 --> 36:35.480
We need it to look like
the other break-ins.

36:39.790 --> 36:40.660
So now you know.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.950
I hired Josh to kill me.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.180
That voice.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.980
You sound exactly like...

36:49.040 --> 36:49.830
The burglar alarm?

36:50.440 --> 36:51.020
Yeah.

36:51.490 --> 36:53.060
I'm the man behind the curtain.

36:53.580 --> 36:54.370
I'm Sal.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.530
I apologize for
using your daughter.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.880
But after Josh shot me,
it became pretty clear

37:00.890 --> 37:02.820
that you were going to lead
the police to the truth.

37:02.860 --> 37:04.250
And I couldn't let that happen.

37:04.730 --> 37:07.490
She was so fascinated

37:07.600 --> 37:08.550
by that alarm.

37:08.790 --> 37:11.200
She really wanted to
believe it could talk.

37:11.460 --> 37:13.150
You manipulated my child?

37:13.600 --> 37:16.810
You bullied her so she wouldn't
identify Josh in the lineup?

37:16.910 --> 37:19.740
You put a gun in my baby's hands!

37:20.110 --> 37:20.870
I did.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.140
And again, I apologize.

37:23.190 --> 37:24.720
But what was I going to do?

37:24.800 --> 37:27.070
Josh left his prints
all over that gun,

37:27.120 --> 37:30.170
even though I told him never
to handle it without gloves on.

37:30.220 --> 37:32.290
And he was supposed
to dump it in a lake,

37:32.340 --> 37:33.790
not in a sewer grate,

37:33.970 --> 37:36.700
where it would just sit there
until a city worker found it.

37:36.850 --> 37:40.440
Hey... I get that
you're angry with me.

37:41.170 --> 37:42.130
But believe it or not,

37:42.680 --> 37:45.040
I had a really good reason
for doing what I did.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.960
You're not even a
little bit curious?

37:52.320 --> 37:54.659
You don't even want to
know why I hired someone

37:54.660 --> 37:56.100
to shoot me in the head?

37:56.110 --> 37:56.990
Not really.

37:57.000 --> 37:57.850
Not now.

37:59.970 --> 38:00.589
At the moment,

38:00.590 --> 38:02.700
all I really want to do is
call the people I work with

38:02.701 --> 38:04.860
and tell them about a
drug dealer in Avondale

38:04.920 --> 38:05.950
who sold Josh the gun.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.760
Oh, and this, uh,
brand-new safety deposit box

38:07.810 --> 38:09.670
that's got $20,000 in it.

38:10.690 --> 38:12.390
I had Huntington's disease.

38:14.790 --> 38:16.490
Do you know anything
about Huntington's?

38:17.210 --> 38:18.240
It's genetic.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.130
I got it from my dad.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.790
You wake up one day,

38:21.850 --> 38:24.130
and you don't have control
of your body anymore.

38:25.010 --> 38:27.150
Your-your limbs move.

38:27.710 --> 38:28.550
They dance.

38:29.010 --> 38:29.900
They writhe.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.110
In the old days,

38:31.150 --> 38:33.760
they thought people who had
it were possessed by a demon.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.610
There's no cure.

38:35.970 --> 38:37.260
There's barely even a treatment.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.230
It's just a slow, terrible death.

38:41.610 --> 38:44.890
And your family,
they get front-row seats.

38:46.020 --> 38:46.670
There was no way

38:46.710 --> 38:48.320
I was putting Amy and
the kids through that.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.860
Not after what I saw with my dad.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.070
So when I realized, I had it,

38:53.700 --> 38:57.450
I decided to bow out gracefully.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.160
Problem was,
I couldn't kill myself.

39:02.010 --> 39:06.070
Life insurance doesn't
pay out for a suicide,

39:06.590 --> 39:08.550
and Amy and the kids
really need that money.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.070
I knew Josh was in a pinch.

39:11.630 --> 39:12.430
So he and I,

39:12.470 --> 39:17.090
we came to a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

39:17.250 --> 39:18.040
An "Arrangement?"

39:18.220 --> 39:19.090
Is that what you call it?

39:19.430 --> 39:20.740
You abandoned your family.

39:20.950 --> 39:22.430
You left your wife to see you lying

39:22.500 --> 39:23.910
in a pool of your own blood.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.970
I know, it wasn't pretty.

39:27.020 --> 39:30.530
But believe me, it was a lot
better than the alternative.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.710
I-I know that you're angry with me.

39:33.880 --> 39:37.670
But this crime that you're
running around trying to solve?

39:39.030 --> 39:40.990
It's really just a case
of assisted suicide.

39:41.050 --> 39:42.430
With, I'll grant you, a little--

39:42.920 --> 39:44.590
a little insurance fraud thrown in.

39:45.900 --> 39:46.940
But there's no murder here.

39:47.770 --> 39:49.210
Not when you really think about it.

39:50.590 --> 39:51.820
You know, if you're not lying,

39:51.970 --> 39:53.800
if you really were sick, I'm sorry.

39:54.370 --> 39:56.040
But I have no reason to trust you.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.019
And, you know, it's really
the courts who decide

39:59.020 --> 40:00.970
whether or not your
death was a murder.

40:01.710 --> 40:02.500
Your call.

40:03.190 --> 40:04.350
But if you keep dialing,

40:05.280 --> 40:07.650
you lose the chance
to cooperate with me.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.280
Cooperate with you on what?

40:09.700 --> 40:10.680
On what?

40:11.190 --> 40:12.050
Did you forget?

40:12.860 --> 40:15.740
Allison, there's a real
murderer out there.

40:15.930 --> 40:18.730
He's already robbed and
killed five people.

40:19.030 --> 40:21.210
And I'm pretty sure he has
no intention of stopping.

40:22.110 --> 40:24.780
One of the only nice
things about being dead?

40:26.330 --> 40:27.770
Gives you a hell of a vantage point

40:27.830 --> 40:28.920
from which to watch the living.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.950
I know an awful lot about this guy.

40:32.530 --> 40:33.960
I can tell you his name,

40:34.760 --> 40:35.510
where he lives,

40:36.160 --> 40:37.080
where he works.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.770
I know where he hides the stuff
he stole from his victims.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.580
I can even tell you the name
of the nice, young couple

40:42.360 --> 40:44.000
he's planning on hitting next.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.350
If I agree to ignore
what you and Josh did.

40:59.510 --> 41:00.230
What's his name?

41:04.900 --> 41:05.570
What?

41:06.950 --> 41:07.850
Nothing. I...

41:08.380 --> 41:10.700
I was just thinking about what
an interesting person you are.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.780
It's kind of a shame

41:12.900 --> 41:14.410
we didn't get a chance
to know each other,

41:14.440 --> 41:15.490
living so close and all.

41:15.910 --> 41:16.720
Matt.

41:17.670 --> 41:18.360
Name.

41:19.450 --> 41:21.150
You should go get a piece of paper.

41:22.150 --> 41:23.830
You're going to want
to get all this down.
