(upbeat music)

00:55.636 --> 00:58.203
- [Toddrick] Man, my pops
told me life could get crazy,

00:58.203 --> 01:01.845
but who knew, this shit could go down.

01:01.845 --> 01:04.302
In life you've got two
choices, left or right?

01:04.302 --> 01:06.567
Not in this goddamn new millennial world.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.991
You can go inside, up,
down, to the corner,

01:08.991 --> 01:12.090
lean, tilt, all types of shit.

01:12.090 --> 01:15.886
And every move you make is
one you're going to pay for.

38:48.844 --> 38:50.406
Like is this, is this paint?

38:50.406 --> 38:52.116
- Don't touch me.

38:52.116 --> 38:54.699
- Okay. I should kick your ass.

38:55.557 --> 38:57.273
I really should.

38:57.273 --> 38:59.858
But I know where we can get a big payday.

38:59.858 --> 39:02.058
As long as we split it, 50 50.

39:02.058 --> 39:03.015
- We ain't partners.

39:03.015 --> 39:04.996
If it's enough to split 50 50, then fine.

39:04.996 --> 39:07.329
- It's enough. Now untie me.

39:08.369 --> 39:10.068

39:12.388 --> 39:13.461

39:13.461 --> 39:14.705
- I don't do partners shit.

39:14.705 --> 39:15.847
- Partners don't treat
each other like this.

39:15.847 --> 39:16.942
It's time to be more respectful.

39:16.942 --> 39:17.812
- One partner got the gun.

39:17.812 --> 39:21.966

40:05.706 --> 40:07.645
You get this done and

40:07.645 --> 40:10.301
- Whatever she said about
me is a motherfuckin' lie.

40:10.301 --> 40:12.276

say nothin' bad about you.

40:12.276 --> 40:13.845
Yep, they comin for you.

She put the booty on me.

40:45.412 --> 40:46.524

40:47.357 --> 40:48.636

58:36.703 --> 58:38.139
that much amount of money?

58:38.139 --> 58:39.852
- [Toddrick] Cause he's not a fuckin' cop.

58:39.852 --> 58:41.623
- [Jay] Nigga, you said he was
a cop, now you flip-floppin.

58:41.623 --> 58:42.951
- [Toddrick] That's before
I knew he had some money.

58:42.951 --> 58:44.557
250,000 is way too much for you.

58:44.557 --> 58:46.940
What'd you doing with that kind of shit?

58:46.940 --> 58:48.942
- Hey look, you want to ask questions.

58:48.942 --> 58:50.321
You want to take me to my
house and get the money?

58:50.321 --> 58:52.789
Let me go, call it a day, what do you say.

58:52.789 --> 58:53.737
- [Toddrick] Man, I don't trust him.

58:53.737 --> 58:55.340
I can't, I don't think we can trust him.

58:55.340 --> 58:56.722
- Man, I barely trust your ass.

58:56.722 --> 58:58.541
Look at the situation we got ourself in,

58:58.541 --> 59:00.052

59:00.052 --> 59:02.310
- [Toddrick] True, true.
Where are you live at?

59:02.310 --> 59:04.591
- Oh, it's not far.
Just up the road a bit.

59:04.591 --> 59:06.411
- [Toddrick] Okay, let's
go get some money nigga.

59:06.411 --> 59:07.979
(car warning bell)

59:07.979 --> 59:09.934
- [Jay] It better be all hundreds, cash.

59:09.934 --> 59:12.228
I don't want to see no plastic.

59:12.228 --> 59:14.069
And I hope you got some food
up in there, cause I'm hungry.

59:14.069 --> 59:15.864
Nigga, I'm about to make
me a big ass sandwich.

59:15.864 --> 59:18.914
- We gunna need some gas to,
cause, I can't bring this back,

59:18.914 --> 59:20.455

59:20.455 --> 59:22.105
Okay. Here's what we're going to do.

59:22.105 --> 59:23.812
I'm go in with him. I'm

59:23.812 --> 59:25.538
And then we out get out. We get out.

59:25.538 --> 59:28.688
- Wow, why can't we go in together?

59:28.688 --> 59:30.267
- What you mean, why

59:35.765 --> 59:38.100

59:38.100 --> 59:40.423
I'm just sayin, I mean,

59:40.423 --> 59:42.718
it makes more sense that we both go in.

59:42.718 --> 59:44.041
(dramatic music)

59:44.041 --> 59:45.446
(fabric rustling)

59:45.446 --> 59:49.263
- Hey look man, when we get in

59:49.263 --> 59:54.253
- Alright guys, the safes in
my room, just down the hall.

59:54.253 --> 59:56.794
- Man, maybe I should
just hang back. You know.

59:56.794 --> 59:58.984
- Just in case this

59:58.984 --> 1:00:01.055
- Oh, you scared now, ha.

1:00:01.055 --> 1:00:01.953

How the hell, who you gunna call for help?

1:00:12.980 --> 1:00:14.583
- I was thinking the police,

1:00:14.583 --> 1:00:16.599
but maybe that's not a bad, a good idea.

1:00:16.599 --> 1:00:18.664
- This is how people end up on
the world's dumbest criminal.

1:00:18.664 --> 1:00:19.975
- I ain't no God damn criminal.

1:00:19.975 --> 1:00:21.118

1:00:32.311 --> 1:00:34.519
Man, why you have to put my
business all on front street

1:00:34.519 --> 1:00:35.539
in front of this white ass cop.

1:00:35.539 --> 1:00:37.708
- He aint no God damn cop, remember.

1:00:37.708 --> 1:00:39.033

1:02:30.618 --> 1:02:32.223

1:02:38.001 --> 1:02:39.753

1:02:39.753 --> 1:02:42.716
- [Jay] Nigga, he just

He just said that to lure us in here.

1:08:32.336 --> 1:08:33.997
- You continued at the Target parking lot.

1:08:33.997 --> 1:08:36.279
Fat bitches, retarded bitches, I saw you.

I mean it went like this

1:08:40.827 --> 1:08:41.935
- Focus, focus.

1:08:41.935 --> 1:08:43.191
- You can put a cup on that motherfucker.

1:08:43.191 --> 1:08:45.269
- If you cry one more

1:08:45.269 --> 1:08:47.375

1:08:47.375 --> 1:08:49.126

Yep, that's me Toddrick Franks.

1:09:31.522 --> 1:09:34.276
After my funny experience,
I realized that, hey,

I am a good boy for life, but on stage,

1:09:37.165 --> 1:09:39.005
I got to make this $50 a night.

1:09:39.005 --> 1:09:39.838
So you motherfuckers

1:09:39.838 --> 1:09:42.153

1:09:42.153 --> 1:09:43.911

Oh yeah, Teddy Todd baby.

1:09:53.088 --> 1:09:54.879
Wait, to you see part two?

1:09:54.879 --> 1:09:56.990

1:09:58.506 --> 1:10:01.876
Anybody else got scared from the fire?

1:10:01.876 --> 1:10:03.674
Nigger, I was nervous as

1:10:03.674 --> 1:10:04.691

1:10:04.691 --> 1:10:05.524
I said "Where?"

1:10:05.524 --> 1:10:08.075
They said fuckin' "Backyard
barbecue, Compton."

1:10:08.075 --> 1:10:11.050
(crowd laughing)

1:10:11.050 --> 1:10:12.860
Nigga I got issues out there I don't wana,

1:10:12.860 --> 1:10:14.153

1:10:14.153 --> 1:10:15.544
I sent out a text
message to all my people,

1:10:15.544 --> 1:10:17.520
said "Y'all need to come support."

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:19.422
Y'all should have read
the replies and shit.

1:10:19.422 --> 1:10:21.138
They said, "Nigga, you tryn' to set me up?

1:10:21.138 --> 1:10:23.511
Nigga, I told you I was
gonna get your $20 back.

1:10:23.511 --> 1:10:25.399
Get your money back

1:10:25.399 --> 1:10:26.233
(crowd laughing)

1:10:26.233 --> 1:10:27.762
That's bullshit, we in Compton nigga.

1:10:27.762 --> 1:10:30.478
But I didn't know Compton
had, enough room like this.

1:10:30.478 --> 1:10:32.841
What, who's house is this?

1:10:32.841 --> 1:10:35.498
Shit, this must be when
redline is startin.

1:10:35.498 --> 1:10:37.871
It's like you niggas are over there.

1:10:37.871 --> 1:10:39.046
Crackers over here.

1:10:39.046 --> 1:10:40.145
(crowd laughing)

1:10:40.145 --> 1:10:42.910
Got one of these cracker
properties, I love it, shit.

1:10:42.910 --> 1:10:44.778
I know yous all pulled up
ands like "Where we at?"

1:10:44.778 --> 1:10:47.839
You seen all the weed growin in the front.

1:10:47.839 --> 1:10:51.745
Came to the back, this bitch
is dead than a motherfucker.

1:10:51.745 --> 1:10:54.694
What kinda fuckin' lawn
guy you got (laughs)?

1:10:54.694 --> 1:10:56.868
The nigga done put the
fake dead grass back in,

1:10:56.868 --> 1:10:59.625
let you know they been tryin.

1:10:59.625 --> 1:11:01.206
What the fuck are y'all doin.

1:11:01.206 --> 1:11:02.642
But the real reason why
I got nervous and shit

1:11:02.642 --> 1:11:04.062
cause I don't like goin to peoples houses.

1:11:04.062 --> 1:11:06.398
That's not my thing. I don't, fuck it.

1:11:06.398 --> 1:11:08.530
Cause y'all got to many house
rules, you know what I mean?

1:11:08.530 --> 1:11:09.683
It's not like the club and shit,

1:11:09.683 --> 1:11:11.082
just don't wear your hat nigga.

1:11:11.082 --> 1:11:12.669
It's different, you come
to somebody's house,

1:11:12.669 --> 1:11:15.301
its like "Aah, take of your shoes buddy."

1:11:15.301 --> 1:11:16.458
(crowd laughing)

1:11:16.458 --> 1:11:17.780
What the fuck is wrong wit
you? You know my feet stink.

1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:19.771
Niggas don't wear socks unless
we got on the flip flops.

1:11:19.771 --> 1:11:20.980
(crowd laughing)

1:11:20.980 --> 1:11:23.653
Some weird shit going on.

1:11:23.653 --> 1:11:24.627
I went to this one white lady's house,

1:11:24.627 --> 1:11:26.673
the bitch took my jacket, I was nervous.

1:11:26.673 --> 1:11:29.832
"Bitch took my jacket, my weeds in there."

1:11:29.832 --> 1:11:31.305
What the fuck is wrong with you bitch?

1:11:31.305 --> 1:11:34.125
It took me 40 minutes to
find the hoe and my jacket.

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:34.958
- [Lady] We're gonna need you done.

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:36.300
- God damn, need to sit my drink down,

1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:38.467
cause the ice done melted.

1:11:39.927 --> 1:11:41.096
Shoulda gave me 30 minutes nigga,

1:11:41.096 --> 1:11:43.193
I got 30 minutes and five
minutes jokes for you niggas

1:11:43.193 --> 1:11:44.528
right quick.

1:11:44.528 --> 1:11:47.148
But any way, na, I seen
you all in this bitch,

1:11:47.148 --> 1:11:47.981
and she got a Rottweiler.

1:11:47.981 --> 1:11:50.062
Y'all seen the Rottweiler?

1:11:50.062 --> 1:11:51.587
I thought it was a white person dog

1:11:51.587 --> 1:11:52.917
because the tail wasn't cut.

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:54.702
(crowd laughing)

1:11:54.702 --> 1:11:56.351
You ain't train this nigga to do shit.

1:11:56.351 --> 1:11:57.984
(crowd laughing)

1:11:57.984 --> 1:12:00.491
God damn lickin his own
ass, nigga you got to fight.

1:12:00.491 --> 1:12:02.770
Live out in Compton
niggas, this a Compton dog.

1:12:02.770 --> 1:12:04.662
Yo fuckin' up your dog with your jump.

1:12:04.662 --> 1:12:07.163
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1:12:07.163 --> 1:12:08.618
No, but I went to my white friend's house

1:12:08.618 --> 1:12:10.139
and I broke one of the
fuckin' house rules.

1:12:10.139 --> 1:12:11.855
I hate the house rule shit. I didn't know.

1:12:11.855 --> 1:12:13.023
I said fuck it. You know what I mean?

1:12:13.023 --> 1:12:14.775
I put on socks just in case.

1:12:14.775 --> 1:12:16.257
So I jumped out the shit

1:12:16.257 --> 1:12:17.759
and the nigga dog was following me around

1:12:17.759 --> 1:12:18.822
the whole fuckin' times.

1:12:18.822 --> 1:12:19.655
I said,

1:12:19.655 --> 1:12:21.764
"This dog is followin a nigga
around, this is bullshit."

1:12:21.764 --> 1:12:22.825
I didn't know he was hungry.

1:12:22.825 --> 1:12:24.621
So I gave that nigga some chicken.

1:12:24.621 --> 1:12:26.226
Here you go motherfucker,
he tore that shit down.

1:12:26.226 --> 1:12:27.292
(lips smacking)

1:12:27.292 --> 1:12:29.450
(dog growling)

1:12:29.450 --> 1:12:31.408
He swallowed that shit and started going

1:12:31.408 --> 1:12:34.749
(chocking) "Help."

1:12:34.749 --> 1:12:37.949
I said, "Bitch. This nigga
dog to ask for help."

1:12:37.949 --> 1:12:39.467
I said, "You gotta get
the away from me nigga,

1:12:39.467 --> 1:12:42.261
don't blame this shit on me."

1:12:42.261 --> 1:12:43.895
White dude came down
the stairs mad as fuck,

1:12:43.895 --> 1:12:47.840
"Oh my God. Did you fuckin' feed him?"

1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:48.877
I said "I didn't feed him,

1:12:48.877 --> 1:12:50.235
I might've dropped some
chicken on the ground

1:12:50.235 --> 1:12:51.562
and the nigga ate it."

1:12:51.562 --> 1:12:53.780
He said "He can't eat human."

1:12:53.780 --> 1:12:56.747
I said "I said chicken
bitch, no human in the.

1:12:56.747 --> 1:12:57.812
What the fuck is wrong with you?"

1:12:57.812 --> 1:13:01.255
He said "He can't eat
what we eat. Fucker."

1:13:01.255 --> 1:13:04.116
When white people call you
fucker, you crossed a line.

1:13:04.116 --> 1:13:05.463
There's almost no going back.

1:13:05.463 --> 1:13:06.717
I said these niggas got my shoes.

1:13:06.717 --> 1:13:09.300
(crowd laughs)

1:13:10.212 --> 1:13:14.529
They said, "Do you understand
this dog has fuckin' diabetes?

1:13:14.529 --> 1:13:17.586
Level three, M.H. I don't
know what the fuck that is.

1:13:17.586 --> 1:13:19.775
But he had it. He's go corona."

1:13:19.775 --> 1:13:22.511
I said, "Well God Damn,
how'd he get all this shit?"

1:13:22.511 --> 1:13:25.641
He said "He had it when we got him."

1:13:25.641 --> 1:13:28.391
(crowd laughing)

1:13:30.838 --> 1:13:33.386
Now only white people do shit like that.

1:13:33.386 --> 1:13:36.545
They wana rescue the dying motherfuckers.

1:13:36.545 --> 1:13:38.628
Come on now, this niggas
on medicated food.

1:13:38.628 --> 1:13:40.568
How the fuck was I supposed to know?
