00:02.440 --> 00:04.078
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Guess who's back.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.071
- Aunt Hailey.
- Did she say why she was here?

00:06.240 --> 00:08.674
- She's out of money. 
- You can't keep living like this.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.273
So I can grow up to be like you?

00:10.440 --> 00:13.000
- He's really not my type.
- What's your type? Seth Cohen?

00:13.160 --> 00:14.832
I didn't want you to be alone
on New Year's.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.150
- I'm having a party.
- We're not going.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.072
I'm not drinking.
Doesn't mean you can't.

00:19.240 --> 00:22.676
- Clean and sober, 11 months.
- Your girlfriend's at a party, alone?

00:22.840 --> 00:25.035
- Not alone, with a guy named Oliver.
- You broke up.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.918
We're just not spending
New Year's together.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.718
I think it's just us tonight.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.874
- She's eating us out of house and home.
- It's just a bagel.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.712
No. No, no, it's never just a bagel.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.917
As someone who's basically been
a shut-in for the last 17 years...

01:37.080 --> 01:39.992
...I can say with great authority
that she never leaves the house.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.118
- She's got nowhere else to go.
- Because her friends want to kick her ass.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.114
- Sorry about the language.
- Why? I'd like to kick her ass.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.319
- Kirsten.
- Coming.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.040
There's no more coffee.
Will you make some?

01:53.200 --> 01:57.159
- The French roast, not the harvest blend.
- No, no, no.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.754
I'll talk to her.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.798
So I'll have to survive
on English muffins.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.070
Marissa? Marissa? Hello.
She's gotta be here somewhere.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.470
- Hilarious.
- Yeah. Okay. Listen to me.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.518
Hailey is always in the living room.
Marissa's always here.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.911
I'm lost. What happened to
Seth-Ryan time? That was quality time.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.514
- Okay. I know I've been a little bit...
- Whipped?

02:22.680 --> 02:24.352
I'm not whipped.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.470
- I'm free to talk now. What's up?
- Squeezing me in before school? Nice.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.473
But actually, I'll take it.
Okay, here's the thing:

02:31.640 --> 02:34.154
Anna and I are gonna take it
to the next level. I need advice.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.914
- You're gonna have sex?
- No. That's a good idea, though.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.150
We're gonna tell Summer
that we're dating.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.471
As much as I fear Summer hurting me,
with the rage blackouts and all...

02:42.640 --> 02:44.790
...I'm actually more scared
about hurting her feelings.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.396
We've become friends now,
and I feel like I don't want to...

02:48.560 --> 02:51.279
- You guys ready to go?
- Yeah. We were just talking.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.429
Really? About what?

02:52.600 --> 02:55.194
Guy stuff. Hunting
and shaving and shoes.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.510
Actually, the cleats for the sports.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.633
Okay, well, come on.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.592
Hey, later, can we finish this chat?
Put in a little Seth-Ryan time?

03:03.760 --> 03:07.639
Yes. Absolutely,
just gotta check with...

03:08.240 --> 03:09.593
Oh, you forgot your balls.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.196
- You and me. Tonight.
- Come on.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.394
- Are we one of those couples?
- Who lose all their friends?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.959
And can't do anything
without each other?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.111
I don't think so. You think so?

04:02.520 --> 04:06.229
- That'd be good, a night apart.
- Yeah, plus, I'm kind of sick of you.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.516
I'm sick of me too.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.432
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. And I got the...

04:12.960 --> 04:15.235
- Walk me?
- I'll walk you.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.432
- Don't make me.
- Don't make you what?

04:22.600 --> 04:23.874
- Hurt you.
- Watch this.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.314
Stop it.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.278
- What's up?
- Hey. What is up?

04:28.440 --> 04:30.271
- I was talking to her.
- That's cool.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.829
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Nothing.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.515
What Anna's trying to say is, she's not
gonna do anything. We're both not.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.240
That's what we're both doing.
We're doing nothing.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.868
But doing that by ourselves.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.870
Thank you, Cohen. You just reminded
me that I need my bio textbook...

04:46.040 --> 04:47.553
...because we're studying monkeys.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.797
Ouch.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.953
I hate liars, and now I'm one of them.
I thought you were gonna talk to her.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.634
I am gonna talk to her.
I don't know how.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.791
- I'll tell her then.
- No. I have to do it.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.758
Tonight me and Ryan
are gonna have a strategy meeting.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.831
We're gonna figure out
the whole thing.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.673
- That makes me feel better.
- Then we'll be free to do this.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.149
- Seth. I have to study.
- And this.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.112
I started my own business
right out of college.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.909
And now I'm a father of two
and I've got one line on my r Ásum Á.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.431
- Did you ever mow your lawn as a kid?
- Yeah.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.068
Great. "Jimmy Cooper Landscaping,"
your first job.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.073
- Now you're an entrepreneur.
- I don't even have references.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.356
Sure you do, your clients...

05:29.520 --> 05:32.239
...whose money you stole. Right.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.631
- Is that Jimmy Cooper?
- Hey, Hailey!

05:36.240 --> 05:37.912
You look fantastic. How you doing?

05:38.080 --> 05:41.197
She's got no jobs,
no friends and no prospects.

05:41.360 --> 05:45.114
- And I say that with love.
- Sounds like we got a lot in common.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.312
- So did you guys have the talk?
- Yes.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.119
We almost did.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.078
We were having fun.
And all we've done is fight for so long.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.959
It was nice to just hang out
and be sisters.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.998
- I'll find out if she has a plan.
- You know what her plan is.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.752
She'll stay here and mooch off us...

06:04.920 --> 06:07.434
...until she can make a withdrawal
from the Bank of Dad.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.511
Then she'll take off again
for a few years.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.356
- She said she wasn't gonna do that.
- She's gonna mooch off us forever?

06:14.520 --> 06:16.078
- She's not mooching.
- Oh, really?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.470
Then how'd she get
all those new clothes?

06:18.640 --> 06:22.792
From the salary she doesn't make?
From the trust fund she drained?

06:22.960 --> 06:24.996
- I bought you bagels.
- That fixes everything?

06:25.160 --> 06:27.958
- Yes, it does.
- Sesame.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.590
That's a start. I'm gonna hide them.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.832
So yeah. Now I'm broke
and sleeping at my sister's.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.075
I'm broke and my wife is sleeping
with your father. Fantastic.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.312
We've done well for ourselves.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.153
Who knew back when
Kirsten and I were babysitting you...

06:46.320 --> 06:48.515
...and you were watching
<i>Silver Spoons</i>...

06:48.720 --> 06:52.030
...that we'd both turn out to be so...?
- Complicated.

06:52.200 --> 06:57.149
- And it was <i>Golden Girls</i>.
- That's right. You loved <i>Golden Girls</i>.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.711
It's impressive that I was 10 and relating
to the lives of 70-year-old women.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.872
Blanche was 70? She aged really well.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.191
I'd love to hang, hear how
you made such a mess of your life.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.509
Same. Although I bet your story
doesn't involve a fistfight at cotillion.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.833
No. But I bet yours doesn't
contain half a pound of hash...

07:18.000 --> 07:20.275
...and a border guard in Budapest.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.509
No.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.915
It's nice that you and Jimmy
are friends again.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.471
I guess I can't blame a guy
for wanting to kiss my wife.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.793
It feels like we never have
any time alone anymore.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.157
That's not true. We have moments.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.880
I want more moments.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.595
- God, they're so whipped.
- I gotta go pick up Marissa.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.034
- Sandy, thank you.
- Anytime.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.397
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.028
Jimmy and I are gonna hang out
tomorrow night, catch up.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.954
- Hang out, like "out"?
- I bet you have a lot to catch up on.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.079
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.155
Hey, man. How's it going?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.871
Got a flat tire.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.951
You ran over a nail?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.429
Somebody slashed it.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.318
Want some help?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.713
Thanks. I got a spare in the back.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.238
Hey, Luke, why doesn't
your dad help you with that tire?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.755
I'm sure he'd like to bend over.

08:35.880 --> 08:40.953
- New Year's resolution. Punch people less.
- I had the same one.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.711
You think I'm getting what I deserve
after years of being a jackass?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.472
Definitely.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.599
Hey, why don't we just get out of here.
The tire can wait.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.551
Yeah, that sounds good.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.793
Go. Go, go, go. Break that tackle.
Go. Yeah!

08:58.960 --> 09:01.918
Who plays PlayStation
for the sports games?

09:02.080 --> 09:06.039
Listen to me. You said Seth-Ryan time.
This isn't Seth-Ryan time.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.794
This is Seth-Luke-Ryan time,
and you know what? Guess what.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.032
- There's no such thing.
- Maybe Luke will have some good advice.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.919
What does that guy know about
juggling women? Come on.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.792
Okay, quite a bit.
But he wasn't good at it.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.916
He's having a bad day.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.514
I'm having a bad day, okay?
I'm having a bad week.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.114
Some kids at school slashed his tires.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.555
Damn it. What do you think
he wants on his pizza?

09:26.720 --> 09:30.190
Hey, Cohen. Check out the replay
on this tackle. I broke this bitch in half.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.114
Luke has a gay dad. Luke has a gay dad.
Can't wait to see it, buddy.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.078
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

09:40.520 --> 09:45.036
<i>I'm at Oliver's, and he</i>
<i>just ordered way too much food.</i>

09:45.200 --> 09:47.111
I know you wanted to spend
tonight apart...

09:47.280 --> 09:48.918
...but he asked if you
would come by.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.389
- You're at Oliver's?
- Summer had plans.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.915
I saw Oliver at therapy.
He said if I wanted...

09:55.520 --> 09:58.557
- <i>That's so good.</i>
- <i>It's Moroccan.</i>

09:58.720 --> 10:00.870
- What's Moroccan?
- The food. Just come. Okay?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.235
<i>See you soon.</i>

10:10.040 --> 10:12.600
How do you guys feel about Moroccan?

10:13.520 --> 10:15.829
I think I really hurt that guy.

10:17.640 --> 10:21.519
- Hey, where's the silverware?
- Moroccan you eat with your hands.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.194
No wonder Luke
seems to be enjoying it so much.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.510
- How good is the couscous?
- Amazing.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.236
- It's pretty good.
- No, that's the kefta.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.311
Couscous is the other thing.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.393
I can't believe you live in a penthouse.
This place is "ridonculous."

10:35.560 --> 10:38.836
It's always been my fantasy
to live in a hotel. Like Eloise.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.719
Yeah, well, I guess.
But with my parents traveling so much...

10:41.880 --> 10:43.438
...it can get a little Ionely.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.397
- Lf you ever need any company...
- Thanks.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.189
They might be gone a while,
opening a new hotel in Paris.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.750
I love Paris. I could spend all day
walking the Champs Elys Áes.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.150
I like Paris. I love baguettes.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.118
Dude, French chicks
don't even shave their armpits.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.472
- Have you ever been to Paris, Ryan?
- No, not yet.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.915
- I hear the Louvre's cool.
- Do not go near it.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.755
Totally overrated. The <i>Mona Lisa</i>'s
the size of a postage stamp.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.912
Now, the Rodin Museum
and the Mus Áe Picasso...

11:12.360 --> 11:15.909
But you know where my family's been
spending most of their time? Switzerland.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.675
- Snowboarding the Alps is unreal.
- You boarded the Alps?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.990
The closest I've ever come
is Whistler.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.674
We have a place in Big Bear.
We should go one weekend.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.355
- Could you teach Ryan to board?
- Lf you can get him on a chair lift.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.637
First two days, you'll be on your ass,
but we'll get you there.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.395
- I really like this song.
- You know, they're playing tomorrow.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.358
- Yeah, but it's all sold out.
- Do you wanna go?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.999
Yeah, but it's all sold out.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.879
I'll call their manager tomorrow.
They're amazing live.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.395
- You know Rooney?
- That would be awesome.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.916
I've never heard of them,
but I got nothing. I'll go.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.354
Ryan?

11:52.520 --> 11:56.308
- Come on, we'll all get to hang out.
- It'll be fun.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.790
- Cool.
- All right, then it's settled. We're going.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.916
- Groovy.
- Hey, nice.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.559
This is gonna be great.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.638
So now you're eating with silverware?
Next thing, I'll see you at the Louvre.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.519
No, you won't, because,
like Oliver said, it's lame.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.757
Can we please focus on the crisis
at hand for one second? Okay?

12:19.920 --> 12:22.354
Summer. The way I figure it,
I have many options.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.112
Like the truth. That's a good one.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.599
Hey, no argument there, buddy...

12:25.760 --> 12:27.955
...but I'm talking about
my messenger of truth.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.270
My delivery system of honesty.
The way I tell her.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.000
- Now, listen. I could call her. That's one.
- Okay.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.869
It is okay, but just okay.
It lacks any real spark or imagination.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.112
But it's effective. Your voice
on one end, hers on the other.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.909
- "I'm dating Anna." She'll hear you.
- But the phone is a blunt instrument, no?

12:44.080 --> 12:47.038
What about text messaging?

12:47.200 --> 12:51.239
I could Blackberry her. That feels very hip,
it feels edgy, it feels 21 st century.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.073
- Kind of cold.
- Mittens required, yes.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.398
A carrier pigeon. How cool
would that be? Think about it.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.996
A little message in his cute little talons.
Summer's a pigeon fan.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.479
- You're a coward.
- Am I?

13:02.640 --> 13:05.677
Or am I just too sensitive
to the feelings of others?

13:06.040 --> 13:08.110
Coward, definitely.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.592
Fine, I'll tell her Monday.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.199
Actually, I think Tuesday.
I might give it till Friday.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.715
That way she'll have the weekend
to let it marinate...

13:17.880 --> 13:20.348
- You could do it today.
- No. Today will soon be tonight.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.239
And tonight will be Rooney.
And Rooney will be awesome.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.075
Rooney. I saw them open
for The Vines in L.A. Last year.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.312
- Big whoop. We're seeing them tonight.
- I thought it was sold out.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.916
It happens they are. But I also happen
to be dialed in. I got the hookups.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.878
Or at least Oliver does.
And I'm gonna ride his coattails.

13:37.040 --> 13:42.239
Oliver? As in Oliver, the guy who wanted
to kiss your girlfriend on New Year's?

13:42.400 --> 13:45.039
- Morning, Hailey.
- It's not like that. He's got a girlfriend.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.590
Wait. If he has a girlfriend, why is he
always hanging out with yours?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.713
- Couldn't tell you, but thanks.
- The guy seems cool, right?

13:51.880 --> 13:54.189
I don't know. We don't seem
to have a lot in common.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.399
- Besides your girlfriend.
- Keep twisting the knife. Feels good.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.199
Whatever. He got us backstage passes.
Good enough for me.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.831
Backstage? So now you have to worry
about your girl with Oliver and rock stars?

14:10.520 --> 14:12.397
Mind if I finish cornflakes?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.789
Hey, at least she asked.
It's a start.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.633
Well, at least she's leaving the house.
It's a start.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.270
- We'll have the place to ourselves.
- Yes. We can eat bagels.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.274
- And I can wear my robe.
- Or not. I can have the remote back.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.955
She's crammed that TiVo full
of every <i>E! True Hollywood</i> special.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.588
- I think she's looking for tips.
- That's nice.

14:32.760 --> 14:36.196
I'm just saying,
she's cluttering up the TiVo.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.874
And a clear TiVo equals a clear mind.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.874
Are we okay with the kids going
to that concert?

14:43.040 --> 14:45.600
- Yeah.
- What if Rooney is, like...

14:45.760 --> 14:49.150
...death-metal Satan-worshipping
speed freaks?

14:49.320 --> 14:52.039
Honey, that went out in the late '90s.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.156
I saw it on a special on E!

14:55.320 --> 14:59.074
I'll run Rooney up my proverbial flagpole,
but you have got to speak to Hailey.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.234
So?

15:04.400 --> 15:09.758
- Yeah, it's my first time hearing it, so...
- That's why we're doing a run-through.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.673
- So you'll have heard it all before tonight.
- Right.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.195
- So we're going tonight?
- No. It's your first concert.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.591
We have free tickets, backstage passes.
You're right, we should skip it.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.150
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

15:23.240 --> 15:26.391
- Have you met Natalie?
- No, but I hear she's great.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.996
- And Oliver is...? I mean...
- Is someone jealous?

15:31.880 --> 15:36.874
This song is good.
Turn it up. Really, really loud.

15:44.640 --> 15:49.509
Oliver will be with Natalie.
Rooney is a really good band.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.592
- And tonight we're gonna have fun.
- I know.

15:52.760 --> 15:56.799
- There won't be dancing, right?
- I'll dance. You can watch.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.996
Works for me.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.593
- I think that's enough.
- What?

16:11.760 --> 16:14.194
There was almost a knee bend.
You were about to find the beat.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.318
- And?
- Remember cousin Jeffery's bar mitzvah?

16:17.480 --> 16:19.869
You almost wiped out a dozen kids
on the dance floor.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.554
That "Y.M.C.A." song
requires a lot of movement.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.713
- I'm just trying to spare casualties.
- So anyone gonna be doing drugs?

16:26.880 --> 16:28.950
I hope so, otherwise
it's a lame-ass concert.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.997
Anyone named Seth
gonna be doing any drugs?

16:31.160 --> 16:33.628
No. Nobody named Seth Cohen.
I promise.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.075
Gotta stay sharp.
It's my first date with Anna.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.357
It is? So you and Summer
finally had the talk?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.476
Oh, yes, almost several times.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.153
- Seth.
- Father.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.198
The sooner you tell her,
the better you'll feel about everything.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.112
See, I don't really believe that.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.671
I'm feeling like the longer I wait
to tell her, the longer I'll feel great.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.751
The best advice
I can give you is this.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.753
It's from Steven Seagal in
his classic film <i>Hard to Kill.</i>

16:58.680 --> 17:02.150
"The anticipation of death
is far worse than death itself."

17:02.320 --> 17:05.232
Great. So then we both agree
that Summer's gonna kill me.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.039
Look, if you're old enough
to go to a concert alone...

17:08.200 --> 17:10.953
...if you're old enough to embark
on a real relationship...

17:11.119 --> 17:13.474
...you are old enough to be a man.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.835
Well, she's not gonna be
there tonight...

17:19.000 --> 17:20.797
...so I'll tell her Monday.
- Good.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.717
Now, get going. Your mother
and I want some time alone.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.839
There's a visual that
I don't want to take with me tonight.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.798
Well, son, your mom's a hottie,
and I got her.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.996
- I don't see him.
- Maybe he's inside.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.878
- Excuse me, are you on the list?
- Yeah, we're with Oliver Trask.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.270
- Who's Oliver Trask?
- You don't have his name?

17:48.440 --> 17:52.797
No, I don't have his name.
I've never heard it. That's why I'm asking.

17:52.960 --> 17:56.953
- Thanks, you've been very helpful.
- I'll call him and see where he is.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.395
- A lot of freaks here, huh, Cohen?
- Yeah.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.757
Good job, Luke. That should
help make us a lot of friends.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.353
- Damn it.
- What?

18:04.520 --> 18:08.513
Well, dude, they're gonna go on soon.
If Oliver's late, we'll miss the first song.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.639
They only have one album. Factor in
your standard cover, that's 12 songs.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.155
Oh, no. But, hey. I mean, come on.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.312
If we don't get in,
we're still gonna have fun tonight.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.152
- Right?
- What are we gonna do?

18:20.680 --> 18:23.319
I hope you guys aren't waiting for me.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.471
- Summer.
- Cohen.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.234
- Hey, Anna.
- Summer.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.918
- Who are you talking to?
- It just goes straight to voice mail.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.548
Dude, look at that freak.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.551
Hey, I drove alone.
Will you ride with me?

18:38.720 --> 18:41.757
You want to give up so early?
Maybe I can grease a few palms.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.638
Hey.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.556
- There you are.
- What's up, man?

18:46.720 --> 18:49.393
- Hi.
- I thought you were a no-show.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.757
- What happened? I said back door.
- No, you didn't.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.151
- Load in here, guys.
- The band's here.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.753
- It's all happening.
- What up, guys?

18:57.920 --> 19:00.753
Robert, how's it going?
Good to see you.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.319
Looking forward to the show.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.233
- Thank you.
- I guess we're on time.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.960
- Which one's Rooney?
- They're all Rooney.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.669
- Hey, man, this is my posse.
- This is crazy.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.837
- Hey. So where's Natalie?
- Yeah, we had another fight.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.152
This whole long-distance thing's tough.
Looks like I'm dateless tonight.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.278
Hey, no! No way.
We'll be your date, right?

19:24.960 --> 19:26.234
Yeah, right.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.916
- So should we fire up the hot tub?
- Interesting. Open a bottle of wine.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.150
Oh, I like it.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.356
First, TiVo. I'm gonna
erase Hailey's programs.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.999
- Hot pizza?
- Hailey.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.435
Hey, guys. You're just in time.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.629
Doctor. Doctor.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.073
- James.
- What's up?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.595
I just thought that you were
going out tonight.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.514
We were. But then I found out there's
a <i>Golden Girls</i> marathon on Lifetime.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.114
And I decided to dig up
all my favorite board games.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.840
We're having a throwback
to the old babysitting days.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.232
- Why don't you guys join us?
- Great. That would be great.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.476
Oh, I love this episode. This is the one
where Rose adopts the pig.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.039
She adopted the pig?

20:18.040 --> 20:20.679
- Do you play?
- A little.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.115
- Here, man.
- All access? Sweet.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.080
- Hey, it's cool?
- It's cool.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.037
- Hey, check it out.
- Seriously?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.997
Yeah.

20:31.160 --> 20:35.790
Awesome.
I just got a few songs that I wrote.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.398
Okay, I'm just gonna...

20:48.160 --> 20:50.515
Seth, you have to tell her tonight.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.114
- No, I don't.
- Hey.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.633
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.109
- So, Luke, he's...
- Yeah, we don't let him out much.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.430
Yeah. But you guys are cool,
having fun?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.511
- Everything's awesome.
- Glad to hear it.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.989
Yeah. Everything is not awesome.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.072
If I don't tell Summer tonight,
then later, when I do tell her...

21:11.240 --> 21:14.232
...she'll remember the fun she had
at Rooney. That will cheer her up.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.712
There's never gonna be a good time
to tell her. Tonight's not a bad night.

21:18.880 --> 21:23.476
There's a lot of guys here.
Cute guys, older guys. A lot of musicians.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.790
Girls like musicians.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.190
Maybe you're right.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.832
Am I flattering myself
to even think that Summer'll care?

21:32.000 --> 21:36.516
I mean, me compared
to that dude or that guy.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.511
- Right.
- Are you checking out dudes again?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.638
No.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.349
But there are plenty here tonight,
aren't there? A lot of musicians.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.909
In fact, I think I'm gonna go
find some myself.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.959
Why don't you and Seth talk.
You know, about anything.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.836
- Cohen, you and Anna...?
- Me and Anna what? What?

21:58.080 --> 22:00.196
Will you guys stand with me
at the concert?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.920
Marissa's on a date,
and I'm all alone tonight, so...

22:03.080 --> 22:04.354
Okay, that would be nice.

22:13.280 --> 22:17.512
Yeah. Hey, man. I thought your boy
was supposed to be here an hour ago.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.591
No. Okay, no excuses.

22:19.760 --> 22:24.515
I don't care who you send. Just make
sure it's good and it gets here quick.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.432
All right.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.039
I can't see. I'm stuck behind
a row of giants. Come with me.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.633
Okay, lead the way.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.235
Sorry.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.878
Hey. Did you tell her?
What did she say? Did she leave?

22:56.040 --> 22:58.270
No. Summer is bringing refreshments
for her friends.

22:58.440 --> 23:02.353
- Seth said you were thirsty.
- Yeah. You are thirsty, aren't you?

23:04.280 --> 23:05.793
- <i>You suck.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

23:07.000 --> 23:10.754
- I gotta pee. You gotta pee?
- I'll come with you.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.314
<i>I'm telling her.</i>

23:18.200 --> 23:21.988
You know the night that Mom and Dad
came home early from Palm Springs?

23:22.160 --> 23:24.276
And we flushed all that beer
down the toilet.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.032
- A lot of good that did.
- I know.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.191
Dad caught you
throwing out the empty bottles.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.795
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Face it, sister.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.632
Everything I know,
I learned from you.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.552
You were a bad influence
back in the day.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.836
How do you think I learned
to piss off Dad?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.595
- The student becomes the master.
- And the master becomes Dad's slave.

23:40.760 --> 23:45.276
Helping to turn paradise into a parking lot,
or at least a three-car garage.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.435
Hey, Connect Four!

23:50.600 --> 23:52.955
Congratulations.
Next Saturday, Yahtzee.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.918
No, wait. Stay. Battleship? Uno?

23:56.080 --> 23:57.991
You know, Sandy's right. It's late.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.391
And, besides, I have a show home
waiting for me in the morning.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.199
Just what Orange County needs.
Another show home.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.511
Airlifted from the McMansion factory
and dropped from the sky...

24:07.680 --> 24:10.240
The one on the bluff,
that's a great house.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.837
If by "great" you mean overbuilt,
overpriced and exactly like this one.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.117
- Oh, nice. Hailey, nice.
- I was kidding.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.511
- I'm laughing on the inside.
- I'm not. You're living in our home.

24:21.680 --> 24:25.958
You're insulting my wife.
You're driving my whole family crazy.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.951
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.156
And we all know
what you're doing here.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.119
She didn't mean anything.
It's just sisters.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.238
No, all this talk about plans,
about growing up, it's shtick.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.119
It's a routine. And it's tired.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.396
You know who's tired? Me.
So why don't we stop.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.834
No, stop protecting her.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.556
You're not even nice to Kirsten.
She's the only reason we put up with you.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.998
Well, you won't have to put up with me
for much longer, okay?

25:01.240 --> 25:03.276
- Sorry?
- It's not your fault, Jimmy.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.351
No, I meant the board game.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.592
- You like <i>The Golden Girls</i> ?
- Yes.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.638
There's a marathon on.
I can't get the song out of my head.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.358
I love <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

25:27.520 --> 25:29.670
It's not Rose's fault.
She just is that way.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.876
You're Rose? I'm Blanche.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.918
It's kind of weird that I relate
to a 70-year-old, but...

25:35.080 --> 25:37.594
How good was the episode
when there was a blackout?

25:37.760 --> 25:39.830
How about when Rose adopts the pig?

25:40.000 --> 25:43.993
Then Sophia loses her glasses
and thinks the pig is a baby.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.957
It's so funny.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.239
Jimmy, wait.

25:59.480 --> 26:03.393
Sorry about that in there.
My little tantrum.

26:03.560 --> 26:08.918
Oh, listen, it's complicated between
you and your sister. It always has been.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.116
You gotta go, like, right now?

26:11.280 --> 26:15.159
Yeah, I don't know if I ever told you,
but I'm an extremely important person.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.118
And so I have to...

26:18.520 --> 26:21.956
Yeah. No, Marissa's at a concert.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.270
Yep, nothing but time.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.036
Didn't tonight feel like
the good old days?

26:28.920 --> 26:34.711
No. It was more like two kind of pathetic
people grasping for the old days.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.470
- Right. That too.
- Yeah.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.916
Look, the good old days.
They're exactly that.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.595
Would you really want to be back
in high school?

26:46.960 --> 26:48.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I would too.

26:49.240 --> 26:55.315
- And you think I'm pathetic?
- Yes, I do. It's sad, really.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.915
I always had a crush on you.
You know that?

27:13.360 --> 27:17.194
No. You were 8
when I went away to college.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.590
So I wasn't...

27:24.160 --> 27:27.755
You're Kirsten's sister.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.312
So I've heard all my life.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.434
Look, we don't want to make
a complicated situation...

27:33.600 --> 27:35.556
...even more complicated, right?

27:35.920 --> 27:40.789
The last thing we need is having
Sandy or Kirsten catching us.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.793
Unless that's what you're hoping for.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.271
Look, your sister is amazing...

27:49.440 --> 27:52.637
...and Sandy is such a great guy.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.872
I think you're lucky
to have them looking out for you.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.876
I know that I am.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.312
I'm gonna go.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.357
Okay.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.440
- Hi. I'm gonna...
- Hey, this is great, right?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.352
Perfect.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.834
Come here a second.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.151
- What are we doing?
- This is better.

30:01.320 --> 30:04.392
Wait. But we're missing the concert.
We can't ditch Oliver.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.155
- Oliver's fine. He's friends with the band.
- And with us.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.959
I thought you said you wanted us
to hang out with friends.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.351
You've known him two weeks.
How good a friend can he be?

30:14.520 --> 30:17.034
Look. He's in recovery,
trying to stay clean.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.713
We can talk about stuff.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.235
He tells me things.
What he's going through.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.960
- Unlike me, right?
- I didn't say that.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.356
I know you didn't want
to come here tonight...

30:30.520 --> 30:32.750
...so, I mean,
I guess if you want to leave...

30:34.120 --> 30:35.599
Right.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.032
Later.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.236
Hey, Luke.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.233
- You know who sings this song?
- Rooney.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.639
- Rooney!
- We should keep it that way.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.870
Yeah, Rooney!

31:10.120 --> 31:11.917
What the hell, man?! Get off me!

31:14.760 --> 31:18.196
- Hey, get off him!
- I'm a cop.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.032
- What? There's gotta be some mistake.
- Yeah. His.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.634
He just tried to buy
3 grams of coke from me.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.998
Ryan, go back inside.
Don't tell anybody.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.074
Excuse me, barkeep, sir.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.355
- Hey.
- What can I get you?

32:15.920 --> 32:19.549
How did you do that? The usual.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.193
- Mountain Dew.
- How many?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.396
Unfortunately, three.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.710
So Anna's telling Summer
that we're a couple.

32:26.880 --> 32:30.156
When they get back, I will officially
be in a relationship with Anna.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.914
Unless Summer kills me,
in which case, you've been like a brother.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.798
Good, because I need
your keys and phone.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.918
- Yeah, you okay?
- I'm fine. It's Oliver.

32:38.320 --> 32:41.551
- What? What's going on?
- Tell you later?

32:41.720 --> 32:43.870
All right. You'll miss
a hell of a show, though.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.190
Rooney's not bad, either.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.556
- Is Jimmy gone?
- Yeah. Is she all right?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.950
I knocked. She didn't answer.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.872
Maybe she's giving us the house back.

32:57.040 --> 33:01.033
Or maybe she's packing and she'll
be gone in the morning. And frankly...

33:01.200 --> 33:05.113
...I'd rather have her here, where I can
keep an eye on her, than anywhere else.

33:05.280 --> 33:10.308
You can't keep her here forever. It's no
good for her and it's no good for us.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.399
Hello?

33:13.520 --> 33:15.636
Hey, what's wrong?

33:15.880 --> 33:18.155
Where are you?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.239
I'll be right there.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.960
Ryan's at the police station.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.518
Thank you, Newport Beach.
Good night, everybody.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.997
- Seth.
- Hey.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.276
- Where have you been?
- At the bar. How was it?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.590
It was amazing.
They played the whole album.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.638
Not with Rooney, how did it go
with Summer? Did you tell her?

33:50.800 --> 33:52.916
Tell me what?

33:59.360 --> 34:00.634
So you're a couple?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.313
- No.
- Yes.

34:02.480 --> 34:06.678
We wanted to tell you first before we
became a couple, which now we are.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.751
- So you chose Anna?
- No.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.231
Kind of, yeah.
She came over on New Year's Eve.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.277
You were with me on New Year's Eve.

34:14.440 --> 34:17.591
Technically, you were with
that guy Allan, remember?

34:17.760 --> 34:22.150
And you kept insisting that
I go find someone to kiss, so I did.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.869
I was taking out the garbage, she was
in the driveway. You know how it goes.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.713
Okay, well, congrats.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.710
You're not mad?

34:35.199 --> 34:38.397
Good, because I didn't want this
to affect our relationship in any way.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.199
Well, Anna, I have to say...

34:41.360 --> 34:45.194
...that Rose would've never pulled
that New Year's stunt on Blanche.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.157
I know. I'm sorry.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.551
Although Blanche
would've done it to Rose, so...

34:51.639 --> 34:54.791
So can we still all hang out?
Will you be cool with that?

34:54.960 --> 34:57.872
We'd both really like that
if we could hang out.

34:59.440 --> 35:03.274
Sure. You guys,
we can totally hang out.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.557
I mean, in fact,
what are you guys doing right now?

35:16.520 --> 35:19.159
So they're gonna let him go.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.118
- Really? How'd you do that?
- I'm just that good.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.875
- I used to play poker with these guys.
- Thanks for doing this.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.713
- You didn't have to, really.
- Is this kid a friend of yours?

35:28.880 --> 35:30.313
He's a friend of Marissa's.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.199
They met in therapy.
He said he's been clean a while, but...

35:33.360 --> 35:34.873
They busted him trying to buy coke.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.271
Then he said his parents are away
for a month. Can you believe that?

35:38.440 --> 35:40.158
A parent leaves a kid
like that on his own.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.992
Yeah, imagine that.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.675
- I'll never understand it.
- I hope not.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.671
- I'm glad you called me.
- Me too.

35:57.440 --> 36:01.319
I'm gonna finish up your paperwork.
You sit tight. I'll be right back.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.958
So thanks.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.910
Seth's dad seems cool.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.871
He is.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.914
So why'd you do this for me?

36:20.440 --> 36:22.954
I mean, you don't even like me, man.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.790
I don't really know you.

36:26.840 --> 36:32.517
Well, if it's any consolation, I don't
like myself very much right now, either.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.314
- So, what happened?
- I don't know.

36:41.480 --> 36:46.156
Natalie didn't show.
And then I saw you and Marissa.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.876
Your friends.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.358
Then it hit me.

36:51.520 --> 36:55.354
I have no one. My parents are gone.

36:55.520 --> 36:59.911
My friends,
if you can even call them that...

37:00.080 --> 37:02.719
...they all disappeared
when I got clean.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.791
Now I...

37:10.120 --> 37:13.999
There's Marissa.
Seth likes your taste in music.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.354
And Luke pretty much
likes everybody at this point.

37:20.040 --> 37:24.397
And what about you? I mean, you must
like me a little to get me out of jail.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.273
No, that was Sandy.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.157
Marissa.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.472
You gonna tell her?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.831
No.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.952
You are.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.437
Hey.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.950
Yeah, it's Oliver.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.955
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

38:14.120 --> 38:16.634
- I can't have half?
- There are other bagels.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.554
- Not salt bagels.
- You ate them all. And several sesame.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.519
I haven't been the best guest, I know.

38:25.280 --> 38:29.876
- And what you said tonight...
- Hey, Connect Four was happening.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.270
It gets my blood up.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.556
Well, you were right.

38:37.360 --> 38:42.639
So, what's the plan? Hit Caleb up
for more cash. And then what?

38:42.800 --> 38:47.271
- Europe this time? Iceland? Boca?
- I don't know.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.352
You know, I see how happy you guys are,
and I think, "Why can't I have that?"

38:52.520 --> 38:54.829
- Because you don't want it.
- How do you know?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.514
I don't even know what I want.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.751
You could stay here.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.275
I mean, not here exactly...

39:03.520 --> 39:05.829
...but, you know, get a home.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.872
- A job. Settle down.
- No.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.834
See, that's the thing.
All I know is what I don't want.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.039
Well, that's not entirely true.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.237
And the rest...

39:26.640 --> 39:29.677
...you'll figure out. Good night.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.878
Good night.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.070
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.671
No, wait, don't get up.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.752
Thanks.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.912
He's not a bad guy, Oliver. He's...

40:00.080 --> 40:01.433
This may come as a shock to you...

40:01.600 --> 40:04.831
...but right now,
I don't want to talk about Oliver.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.033
Oh, hey, wow, kissing.
Sorry about that.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.476
We're gonna hang out inside, but
you guys are obviously alone together...

40:18.640 --> 40:19.675
...so do that.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.798
- Ryan, what happened to you?
- Luke, please, you're shouting.

40:22.960 --> 40:27.112
- Someone stood too close to the speaker.
- Dude, that concert did not suck at all.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.070
- We PlayStationing it, or what?
- Yeah. Any time you want to join us.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.515
Let's go before he wakes up
your parents.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.352
Think we can teach him to fetch?

40:36.520 --> 40:40.559
I don't want to be the third wheel
or watch you guys make out, so enjoy.

40:42.360 --> 40:46.353
- Well, we could stay here.
- Yeah, but maybe we should...

40:47.040 --> 40:48.871
Race you?

40:49.640 --> 40:51.790
Cohen, you've played
this game before?

40:51.960 --> 40:54.520
See the way I ripped
that guy's spine out?

40:54.680 --> 40:56.750
Sitting right here, buddy.

40:58.720 --> 41:03.430
I am so glad we all could hang out
together like this, aren't you guys?

41:04.720 --> 41:05.914
- Yeah.
- Damn it.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.593
- Ryan, you're up.
- You're up, Ryan.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.115
We'll make it best of five.
