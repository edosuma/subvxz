WEBVTT

00:12.179 --> 00:13.226
Don't!

00:13.597 --> 00:14.769
Where the hell are you, Cass?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.058
I am fine.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.272
You don't sound okay.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.608
What I have, you can't help me.
Please, tell Sam.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.275
Rowena escaped with
the Book of the Damned and the Codex.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.988
...is Amara.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.078
We're bound, Dean.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.956
We'll always be bound. You helped me.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.120
We will always help each other.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.922
I think Amara's The Darkness.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.082
Interesting.

00:40.249 --> 00:44.675
Whatever's in that house,
I can taste the power radiating from it.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.172
It's old. Deep.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.929
Dark.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.267
- Where are you going?
- To see the child that eats souls.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.602
Stay away from her.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.854
I want that child.
And I get what I want.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.860
My, haven't you grown
into a sweet young thing?

01:08.485 --> 01:11.489
I feel the spell
just cutting deeper and deeper.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.828
And I'm trying to fight it. I'm trying.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.001
Help me.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.898
And they shall know us far and wide.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.861
And fear us. And we shall be known as the

01:48.317 --> 01:49.864
Mega Coven!

01:54.197 --> 01:55.870
Mega Coven.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.793
See, because it's greater
than "Grand Coven."

01:57.951 --> 02:00.454
So it's not grand. It's mega.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.873
It's the Mega Coven.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.291
I don't think you're following.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.505
And why ever would we join you
in such a thing?

02:05.667 --> 02:09.045
Because that Grand Coven of yours
is obsolete, don't you see?

02:09.713 --> 02:13.843
And utterly failing apart since
the High Priestess Olivette disappeared.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.720
Which we hear you may have had a hand in.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.145
Idle gossip.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.606
Cut the crap, Rowena. You're just looking
for protection from the hunter Winchesters

02:22.809 --> 02:24.982
and all the rest of your many enemies.

02:25.729 --> 02:30.735
And, honey, you don't have the guts
or the chops to pull this off,

02:30.901 --> 02:32.699
so let's not kid ourselves.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.075
Really?

02:36.114 --> 02:39.368
It so happens I killed the King of Hell.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.624
My own son,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.715
the King of Hell.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.584
And compelled an angel to do it!

02:47.751 --> 02:51.631
Guts? Chops? I'd say that qualifies!

02:51.797 --> 02:55.802
I have a friend who cut a deal
with Crowley only yesterday.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.433
Crowley didn't look so dead.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.934
What?

03:00.097 --> 03:02.771
You're as delusional as ever.
We'll be going.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.728
Delusional? We'll see.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.913
He lives?

03:54.818 --> 03:58.948
So that was the last of the neighbors.
Just like the rest.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.284
Dean?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.668
- Dean.
- Yeah.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.049
- You okay?
- Yeah.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.299
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.758
Just saying we got nothing.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.843
No one saw anything unusual
going on at the house

04:16.005 --> 04:17.303
the day the baby disappeared.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.973
If this is truly The Darkness
we're talking about,

04:21.136 --> 04:23.013
it's more of a time bomb than a baby.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.019
Yeah, but it is still a baby, right?

04:25.182 --> 04:28.982
I mean, The Darkness I saw was an adult.
So it still has to, uh, to grow up.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.272
The Darkness is almost infinite power.

04:32.189 --> 04:35.068
I'm not sure what "growing up"
means in this case.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.821
Well, God kicked this thing's
ass once before, right?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.669
Yeah, it'd be nice if he put down
the mai tai and show up for work.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.034
I wouldn't count on it.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.481
It's possible he's around.
Closer than we think, you know?

04:45.535 --> 04:46.536
What makes you say that?

04:46.703 --> 04:50.128
I believe he made a fairly definitive
statement when he walked away.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.054
Sorry about those, Cass.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.380
Till we know what's going on with you,

04:57.547 --> 04:59.515
you're still a bit of a wild card.
You know?

05:05.722 --> 05:06.974
I hate to point this out,

05:07.140 --> 05:10.485
but you both know who we might need
to help deal with The Darkness.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.354
Don't even say it.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.406
He was God's scribe.
He did hear about everything.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.862
That's just like saying it.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.741
- Cass, you all right, pal?
- It's the spell.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.074
We were hoping your angel wiring
would fight it off

05:26.076 --> 05:28.420
or slow it down at least.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.127
It appears I simply respond
differently from humans.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.969
If you were you human,
you'd be gone.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.460
With you, it's like it's digging deeper.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.420
You know, Rowena's the only one
who can remove it.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.884
We're doing everything to find her, okay?
But so far, we got nothing.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
Well, it's getting worse.

05:48.306 --> 05:52.277
Yes, Majesty, my operative is certain.
Your mother has been found.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.112
Then move.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.288
Annihilate the treacherous bitch.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.961
She's making impressive progress
in her studies,

06:14.124 --> 06:16.468
considering just days ago
she was in diapers.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.550
Watch her.
She speaks to no one outside the court.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.557
If she's half as powerful
as I think she is, I want her on my team.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.895
"Amara." It's a pretty name.
Did you name her?

06:27.304 --> 06:30.228
That's what the lovely Jenna called her,

06:30.432 --> 06:33.276
just before Amara sucked out her soul.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.320
What do we have her watching now?

06:37.439 --> 06:39.066
Hitler's Nuremberg speeches.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.318
We had them translated.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.777
Hmm.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.665
Amara, sweetie.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.122
You can take a little break if you like.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.876
Nanny said you're doing very well
with your schooling.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.877
I want you to be happy in your new home.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.889
Whatever you want, whenever you want it,
you just have to ask.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.592
I just want you to save me. From him.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.563
From God? He's been very mean
to my little girl, hasn't he?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.107
- He tricked me.
- He's a wily one.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.901
He sealed me away.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.152
And how exactly did he manage that?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.158
I don't want to talk about it.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.656
Of course.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.489
You're a very lucky girl. I'm a king.

07:27.697 --> 07:32.043
And if anyone can protect you
from that rascally deity, it is I.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.499
Thank you.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.751
"Thank you, Uncle Crowley."

07:42.754 --> 07:43.755
Hmm.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.385
"How did this happen?"
I kept asking myself.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.061
Witchcraft was a proud
and adventurous calling.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.440
But the Grand Coven let it collapse
in disgrace.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.893
Cowardly witches hiding in shadows.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.237
Well, we were being burned
or hung by the thousands.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.114
It put a lid on our enthusiasm.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.193
Nonsense. Poor leadership.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.403
Our people deserve a renaissance.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.199
And I'm looking for the best of the best
to leave the Grand Coven

08:10.407 --> 08:13.877
and join me in the

08:15.245 --> 08:16.963
Mega Coven!

08:23.753 --> 08:25.755
You heard what I said, right?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.930
- My, look at the time.
- Mmm.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.852
Did I mention I have in my possession
the Book of the Damned?

08:38.351 --> 08:42.447
Aye, written by crazy Sister Agnes herself
on her own flesh.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.994
Its secrets are making me
a force of nature, girls.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.987
A force of nature.

08:49.154 --> 08:54.627
And you'd share these secrets
with the Mega Coven?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.627
I've always been a giver.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.124
Is there a chance I could be an officer?

09:01.332 --> 09:04.757
In the Grand Coven,
I never made it past sergeant-at-arms.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.135
You have no idea
the rewards headed your way.

09:39.329 --> 09:43.050
Come on, Crowley, pick up!
I've left you a dozen messages.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.011
Why isn't he answering the phone?

09:46.211 --> 09:47.713
Because he's a dick.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.805
And that's not breaking news.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.976
He's gotta have Rowena
in his sights, right?

09:52.133 --> 09:54.135
I mean, she did try to take him out.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.141
He's not gonna deliver Rowena to us
just so she can lift the spell.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.436
He'd rather let it do
whatever it's gonna do to me.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.802
He's gotta be up to something.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.569
Yeah. Again, not breaking news.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.530
Metatron is also off the grid.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.535
He stole your car
in Blaine, Missouri, right?

10:11.694 --> 10:12.695
Yeah.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.411
Yeah, uh, no accidents,
incidents, violations

10:15.573 --> 10:19.874
or anything remotely interesting involving
a crappy '78 Continental Mark V.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.376
You think it's crappy?

10:26.209 --> 10:27.836
Eye of the beholder.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.712
Oh...

10:30.713 --> 10:34.308
He's a shut-in for centuries,
former scribe of God.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.720
You wouldn't think
he would be a good driver.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.926
You know what? I'll look for unusual
occurrences at places he might hang out.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.396
Cass.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.116
Places Metatron might hang out.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.698
Um...

10:54.070 --> 10:56.573
He loves waffles.
You could try places that have those.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.788
Okay, so every restaurant
in the entire country.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.010
Cass?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.592
Cass! Cass, hey!

11:18.595 --> 11:21.439
Easy, easy. Cass?

11:26.936 --> 11:30.236
Cass. Hey. Are you okay?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.109
Relative to what?

11:33.359 --> 11:35.407
Do you know where you are?
What's the date?

11:36.279 --> 11:37.531
Earth.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.579
Several billion years from the beginning.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.456
Come on, buddy.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.299
It's like I was inside a blender

11:49.125 --> 11:53.050
that was set to purée for a tomato salsa.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.223
And you're the tomato?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.925
In this analogy, yes.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.308
Yeah.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.350
Cass, what was that?
You scared the crap out of us.

12:04.599 --> 12:08.149
I blacked out for a lot of it,
but I don't...

12:09.270 --> 12:11.238
I don't know, it overwhelmed me.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.655
I... I couldn't control it.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.697
Let's get him up. Come on. Come on.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.831
There you go.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.204
- We gotta find that witch.
- Yeah.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.623
What can I do to help?

12:27.789 --> 12:29.709
No, no.
You just, uh, sit there, take a breather.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.672
Try and put yourself back together.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.930
Okay. I'll do my best.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.311
It's difficult with these voices.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.523
Now there are voices?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.936
Are these voices telling you
to hurt someone?

12:49.185 --> 12:53.486
No, guys, I'm hearing Angel Radio.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.155
It's a lot of chatter. They're...

12:57.151 --> 12:58.871
They've been looking
for me since I escaped,

12:59.070 --> 13:01.368
As well as scouring the earth
for the perp.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.878
- It's slang for "perpetrator."
- Ah.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.545
Yeah, thank you.
Um, any, any perp in particular?

13:11.708 --> 13:14.507
Metatron. They're doubling the effort
to find him,

13:14.711 --> 13:17.965
so if we need to get hold of him,
we'd better do it soon.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.676
Yeah, before the God Squad does.
All right, well, first things first.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.268
Listen to this, may be something here.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.225
Uh, in Denver,
three women were at this Café Elta,

13:29.392 --> 13:32.566
when their waiter, for no apparent reason,
stabbed and killed one.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.778
One survived, and the third vanished

13:35.940 --> 13:39.444
after furniture seemed
to slide around by itself.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.700
What do you think?

13:41.863 --> 13:45.083
Uh, who's your lead
on the Café Elta investigation?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.409
You look confused.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.285
Troubled.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.327
God did all of this
after he locked me away.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.791
I didn't know it was so much.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.796
All for his own ego.

14:32.955 --> 14:37.005
And no matter what he made,
that doesn't excuse what he did to us.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.966
I know.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.300
Amara.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.641
You must stay fixed on our purpose.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.394
Even we cannot undo what's already done.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.475
But as you grow and become stronger,

14:51.641 --> 14:53.860
your true destiny
will become clear to you.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.937
I am what you are becoming.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.363
And we are mightier than God.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.329
Not in bed yet?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.206
Not yet. Soon.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.210
Working on your studies. Good girl.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.833
Learning anything interesting?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.836
I think SO.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.883
Hmm.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.002
Hey.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.879
Hey.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.886
Pretty bad in Heaven?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.887
Yep. How about downstairs?

16:04.046 --> 16:06.390
Yeah. Don't get me started.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.926
Alarms go off?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.260
You wouldn't believe.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.350
I know, right? Us, too.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.681
Something's changed.

16:13.890 --> 16:14.982
Something's here.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.736
It's big. Big as God. Big as Lucifer.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.398
They doing anything about it on your end?

16:21.564 --> 16:24.158
Zip. How about upstairs?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.110
Business as usual.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.031
You'd think there'd be an executive order.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.491
The King's holed up doing who knows what.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.420
After Hannah died,
Heaven's pretty much been a suck sandwich.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.548
You know who gets squeezed?
It's grunts like us.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.376
Yeah, punch a clock, you're expendable.

16:47.924 --> 16:51.519
You know, our two operations
will always butt heads. That's the setup.

16:52.553 --> 16:55.602
But this? We could be out of work.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.689
Yeah. We get knocked out, it takes over.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.942
Someone's gotta do something.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.276
Someone?

17:03.439 --> 17:06.032
Yeah. If management won't,
it's up to the little guy.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.704
Yeah. I hear you.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.953
Power to the people, my friend.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.036
Well, not actually people.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.796
You know what I mean.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.621
Sheriff's station...

17:29.632 --> 17:30.975
Thanks.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.354
- Agents, I've got to go.
- We got it. Yeah.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.522
Hello.

17:39.892 --> 17:44.773
So, ladies lunch goes south when a waiter
who reeks of sulfur

17:44.981 --> 17:48.986
attacks with a blade, killing one of you,
while the redhead who invited you

17:49.151 --> 17:51.950
yells something in Latin, disappears,
and the furniture forms a pile.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.201
That about right?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.407
Uh-huh.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.243
Any idea why a demon
would wanna attack three witches?

17:57.451 --> 17:59.453
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.341
Right. The waiter was possessed by a demon
assassin who was gunning for Rowena,

18:03.499 --> 18:05.297
since she tried to kill her son, Crowley,

18:05.501 --> 18:07.845
who just so happens to be
the King of Hell.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.342
Why do I think you're not FBI,
like the police said?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.010
Let's cut to it.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.929
The cops say that you're so scared
you don't wanna leave here.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.643
Well, you should be.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.566
'Cause Crowley's
not only going after Rowena.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.651
He's going after every witch
that she hangs with.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.778
- I'm no witch.
- Sure you are.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.275
And your pal Rowena,
she's recruiting a new coven. Hmm?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.445
You can't do this, I have rights.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.530
And I have a fake badge.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.074
Look at this!

18:38.200 --> 18:40.669
Chicken bones, hex bags.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.880
A pentagram.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.838
Still sticking with, uh, "not a witch"?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.636
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.879
Listen, before you finish
what you're about to say,

18:51.881 --> 18:55.385
know that we are the only thing
between you and Crowley's ninjas.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.555
But I didn't try to hurt him!
I mean, I am nobody!

18:58.763 --> 19:00.561
I'm... I'm worse than nobody.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.943
I'm... I'm nobody's third cousin
who doesn't even get invited to dinner.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.647
Look, we don't care.
We just need to know where Rowena is.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.072
I have no idea.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.529
But you do know how to scry,
is that right?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.828
"Scry"? What's that?

19:14.028 --> 19:16.030
Exactly what you know it is.

19:16.238 --> 19:20.209
A locating spell. When you witches
use crystals and prisms and mirrors

19:20.409 --> 19:22.707
to divine images
of who you're trying to find.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.381
We're trying to get our hands
on Rowena, okay?

19:25.539 --> 19:28.418
Now, with her out of the picture,
Crowley has no reason to go after you.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.631
You got it?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.471
I don't have my crystals.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.643
Oh.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.687
Well,

19:44.433 --> 19:46.811
this ought to work, huh?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.398
I'll get the light.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.915
I see her.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.294
She's packing a bag.

20:18.259 --> 20:21.138
Amara, I have a gift for you.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.186
Two, actually.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.357
Is that blood?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.438
Probably.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.074
And...

20:38.654 --> 20:41.624
You have to forgive me
for being the tiger mom,

20:41.824 --> 20:45.169
but it's never too soon
to improve your mind with books.

20:45.828 --> 20:50.174
Agreed, but I like the one
Nanny gave me more.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.095
Dante's Inferno in the original Italian.

20:58.799 --> 21:02.349
Has Nanny been teaching you other things
about our world?

21:02.511 --> 21:05.310
Some. It doesn't work very well, does it?

21:05.598 --> 21:08.101
That's God for you.
Not really thought out.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.361
The whole big-bang thing,
more of a big bust.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.026
I mean, boom! Bang!

21:13.189 --> 21:16.033
Stars. Evolution. Taylor Swift.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.361
I'm guessing
you'd have done things differently.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.906
I sure will. I've had a lot of time
to think it through.

21:23.449 --> 21:27.124
Any specifics
that we have to look forward to?

21:28.746 --> 21:30.373
I'm hungry.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.134
Of course.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.887
Goodies.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.415
I killed her.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.086
Not quite.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.027
The meat-suit was already dead.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.254
It was just the soul that was inside it
that was keeping it alive.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.339
Not anymore.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.796
Thank you, Uncle Crowley.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.516
You're welcome.

22:38.107 --> 22:41.452
Airport. And be careful with the bags.
They're antiquities.

22:48.117 --> 22:52.714
Just my way of giving you the finger,
Mr. Winchester.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.091
I don't suppose you're here to thank me
for removing the Mark of Cain,

22:56.250 --> 22:58.799
which, by the way, you're welcome.

23:00.296 --> 23:04.301
Let's just take things up a notch,
what do you say?

23:09.763 --> 23:11.436
I'd think you'd know by now, Samuel.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.727
These things don't hold me long.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.936
They just need to hold you long enough.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.273
Well, they do say blondes have more fun.

23:23.027 --> 23:27.533
"To pull up information
on a car, select search box,

23:27.740 --> 23:30.789
"type in violations

23:30.951 --> 23:35.923
"and enter license plate number, make."

23:44.673 --> 23:46.193
Fortune Nookie,

23:46.342 --> 23:49.642
your premiere website
for all your Asian girl fantasies.

23:51.722 --> 23:56.273
We have hundreds of lovely girls
just waiting to chat with you,

23:56.477 --> 23:58.650
twenty-four hours a day.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.244
What could "Fortune Nookie" be?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.037
Castiel.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.358
Don't!

24:34.974 --> 24:37.443
The cafeteria is serving
dead meat-suits, right?

24:37.643 --> 24:38.895
Yes, Majesty.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.735
No chance of soulless lunatics
roaming the halls.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.783
Did I hear someone mention dessert?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.032
In a minute, sweetheart.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.701
Now, what were we just chatting about?

24:49.905 --> 24:53.830
How when God created mankind,
he really screwed it up.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.661
Language!

24:55.869 --> 24:58.247
Is that any way
for a primal force to speak?

24:58.455 --> 25:03.427
Every time I take in a soul,
I feel how much emptiness there is.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.717
Yes.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.598
God made a world
where people have to suffer.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.638
And then they die.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.935
Unfortunately.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.644
But frankly, why would they want
to live in such a world?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.732
I salute your insight, cupcake.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.822
Yes, God's plan is hideously flawed.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.657
But you and I together,

25:26.608 --> 25:29.487
well, we can shape things
to our own worldview.

25:29.737 --> 25:33.662
A place where, like the dinosaur,
virtue is extinct.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.624
Where the very air
that we breathe is pure evil.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.038
Would you like that?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.463
Would you?

25:43.792 --> 25:47.638
You'd really be happy
if everyone was evil?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.768
Well, actually, now I come to think of it,

25:52.968 --> 25:56.893
if everyone was dark and damned,
it wouldn't be much of a challenge.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.734
Watching a human reject the light
and embrace depravity,

26:00.934 --> 26:04.108
yes, well, that's where
the gratification really is.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.656
Never gets old.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.944
This bemuses you?

26:11.528 --> 26:13.280
Good. Evil.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.324
Heaven. Hell. People.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.165
It all seems so unimportant.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.125
Well, I don't know that I'd say that.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.335
I don't think
you're seeing the big picture.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.842
Meaning what exactly?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.261
Guess what, Uncle Crowley?

26:29.838 --> 26:31.761
I'm hungry.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.888
No!

26:43.936 --> 26:47.986
Mind the undergarments, Samuel.
Imported, of course.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.612
Where is it?

26:49.817 --> 26:51.194
Where's what, dear?

26:51.360 --> 26:54.705
The book. The Book of the Damned.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.288
The Codex is in there, but the Book
is not. So where the hell is it?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.999
Do you take me for a fool?

27:01.328 --> 27:05.253
Like I'd run around with those
two spectacularly powerful items

27:05.457 --> 27:07.380
anywhere in proximity!

27:07.543 --> 27:10.922
Well, now we've got the Codex.
And Charlie's code-breaking.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.849
So the Book isn't as useful to you
as it was.

27:14.007 --> 27:18.057
Or so you hope.
That's what I admire in you, Samuel.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.222
That plucky optimism.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.817
That plucky, stupid optimism.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.314
Sam, why don't you go grab Cass

27:25.477 --> 27:27.277
so Florence Nightingale here
can do her stuff?

27:29.940 --> 27:31.112
Yeah.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.877
You do recall our deal, eh?

27:46.582 --> 27:49.005
First I de-spell the angel.
Then I go free.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.591
Mmm. Except for one thing.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.755
There were no exceptions
in our arrangement.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.890
The Book. Gonna need that baby back.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.552
The Book was never mentioned
in our negotiations.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.016
Well, now it is.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.018
Our deal says...

28:02.181 --> 28:03.979
Our deal says whatever I want it to say.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.236
You're gonna play by my rules because

28:12.149 --> 28:13.992
I have your son on speed dial.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.453
Call him.

28:19.031 --> 28:23.662
If I'm dead,
you've got a big fat pile of nothing.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.421
No Book. Ever.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.208
And your friend with the bent halo?

28:30.083 --> 28:33.178
He goes foaming-at-the-mouth mad and dies.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.172
Your turn.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.309
Your eyes.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.520
So burdened.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.985
What happened, precisely,
when I removed the Mark?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.321
The Book wasn't specific.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.820
Yes, I read quite a bit of it.

28:58.111 --> 29:02.457
What new hell has Dean Winchester
unleashed upon the world?

29:04.993 --> 29:06.415
- Dean!
- Yeah?

29:06.620 --> 29:08.213
Hey! I can't find Cass!

29:08.455 --> 29:11.174
- What?
- He's not there. He... He broke free.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.710
He's gone.

29:34.648 --> 29:38.323
So absurd, driving in circles
looking for your unhinged angel.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.158
We're not driving in circles, all right?

29:40.320 --> 29:44.041
We're locked onto his phone's GPS.
We're tracking his location.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.745
I have no idea what you just said,
but I'm sure I could do it faster.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.915
Yeah, maybe you could,
but you would have to do a spell,

29:51.081 --> 29:53.755
which means
we would have to take the cuffs off.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.008
And we are not
going to take the cuffs off.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.931
There's no trust? Are we not a team?

30:00.132 --> 30:01.384
No.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.525
You sent for me, sire?

30:14.730 --> 30:16.198
I wanted to commend you

30:16.398 --> 30:18.696
for how well you've stepped
into your new role as nanny,

30:18.859 --> 30:21.203
after the last one became indisposed.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.122
"Indisposed"? She's dead.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.247
At any rate, you seem to be cut out
for this kind of work.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.628
Amara clearly responds to you.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.798
She looks at me like she wants to eat me.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.080
She wants to eat everyone.
Don't take it personally.

30:35.167 --> 30:39.138
Majesty, uh, I have no experience
with children. Um...

30:39.463 --> 30:41.181
Is there nothing else I can do?

30:41.423 --> 30:42.845
Apparently not,

30:43.008 --> 30:45.932
seeing as you failed
to assassinate my mother.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.097
I'd hate to be disappointed twice.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.021
I'm aware.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.859
So, here's the thing.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.233
Amara seems to be growing
in leaps and bounds.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.620
Not just in maturity,
but in strength and confidence, too.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.999
I don't want her to get out of hand
before I'm sure of her loyalty.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.785
I need you to stop overfeeding her.

31:10.118 --> 31:14.123
But you said to give her
whatever she wants, whenever she wants it.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.425
Now I'm saying
something different, aren't I?

31:16.750 --> 31:17.797
Yes.

31:18.043 --> 31:22.594
We don't want a generation of entitled,
pudgy kids, do we?

31:22.798 --> 31:24.391
No, we do not.

31:25.050 --> 31:29.772
So, simply inform her
that we're cutting back on her soul food,

31:29.971 --> 31:32.724
that uh... It's the healthier choice.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.022
You want me to tell her this?

31:42.651 --> 31:44.574
You are her nanny, aren't you?

31:44.820 --> 31:45.867
Well...

31:46.154 --> 31:49.158
'Cause if you're not the nanny,
then what are you?

31:49.950 --> 31:53.830
I know. Roasting on a spit
until the end of time.

31:55.872 --> 31:59.342
I'll, uh, do my best.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.006
Good man.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.140
And you look wonderful in an apron.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.363
You wouldn't think a road trip with two
such strapping lads could be this tedious.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.615
- Shall we have a wee sing-song?
- No.

32:27.612 --> 32:31.742
I've myself to blame. I should
never make deals with Winchesters,

32:31.950 --> 32:35.079
since they seem unable
to hold up their end of the bargain.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.630
Meaning what?

32:36.830 --> 32:40.175
Oh, just that thing between Sam,
Crowley and myself.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.051
What? What's she talking about?

32:45.464 --> 32:49.560
Oh, surely, you knew Sam
made a deal with me to kill my son

32:49.718 --> 32:52.221
if I removed the Mark of Cain
from your arm.

32:52.721 --> 32:57.101
Well? Is the Mark gone? Yes.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.690
Is Crowley dead? No.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.400
Mmm. Oh!

33:01.563 --> 33:03.031
You didn't know?

33:04.399 --> 33:06.151
He didn't know?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.697
Look, I was gonna tell you, obviously,

33:09.863 --> 33:13.333
but nothing ever came of it, sol, I
figured there was no point, you know?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.080
No point, huh?

33:15.243 --> 33:17.621
I mean, I see what Dean's saying.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.675
Your wee pal Castiel wouldn't be in this
pickle if you'd done what you promised.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.993
I would have had no reason
to cast the Attack Dog spell

33:24.127 --> 33:26.004
if Crowley were already dead.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.468
Excellent point.

33:27.631 --> 33:30.976
It's not my point. Sam knows my point.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.894
Keyword, "secrets."

33:34.930 --> 33:36.273
Ah, well,

33:36.473 --> 33:39.443
I'm just glad
I got the conversation flowing.

33:39.684 --> 33:43.109
Family relations are a specialty of mine.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.905
- Did he stop?
- Hey. Yeah, he stopped.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.370
And he's close.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.489
Come on.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.331
All right, he's gotta be around here
somewhere, so I'll head up the street.

34:35.489 --> 34:36.610
You guys head the other way.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.493
Are you joking? I'm in heels.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.575
- Hey.
- Get a life.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.411
Hi! I did.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.625
Cass! Cass! Don't do this.

36:50.792 --> 36:54.387
Okay, this isn't you. It's the spell.
You can beat this.

36:55.088 --> 36:58.137
Cass. Let her go.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.390
Go! go! go!

37:08.643 --> 37:10.941
Hey. Okay, okay.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.693
It's gonna be okay, buddy, all right?

37:37.338 --> 37:39.887
Do I need to remind you
these are witch-killing bullets?

37:40.091 --> 37:41.183
Finish it!

37:42.010 --> 37:43.512
Yes, yes, all right.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.402
Cass?

38:01.112 --> 38:03.456
Cass? Cass.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.246
Hey.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.420
Come on. Come on.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.430
Hey.

38:36.439 --> 38:40.535
I'm sure you had every intention
of honoring our deal,

38:41.528 --> 38:43.201
but why take chances?

38:59.921 --> 39:01.173
Hey.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.552
You should keep applying that.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.138
Thanks, Morn.
Why don't you just keep the beers coming?

39:08.429 --> 39:11.774
Dean, I... There aren't words...

39:12.016 --> 39:15.111
You're right. There aren't words, Cass,
'cause there's no need.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.439
You were under a spell, it's fine.

39:18.022 --> 39:22.027
Yeah, but you had Rowena.
Because of me, you...

39:22.235 --> 39:23.782
You know, Cass...

39:24.571 --> 39:26.414
We've got the Codex. That's a start.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.787
You know, it'll slow Rowena down some.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.745
If we'd killed her, the Book of the Damned
would've been lost.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.504
Besides, we got bigger fish to fry.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.584
The Darkness. What does she want?

39:36.791 --> 39:39.294
Well, the big question is,
where the hell is she?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.056
Dean, I can fix that.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.721
No, no, no. No, no, it's fine, Cass.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.970
Besides, I had it coming.

40:03.192 --> 40:07.163
"...hereby command and decree...
Blah, blah, blah.

40:07.530 --> 40:12.127
"Hung up to all eternity...
Entrai removed..."

40:38.519 --> 40:39.691
Amara?

40:47.820 --> 40:49.367
I'm hungry.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.624
Of course, poppet.

40:51.783 --> 40:55.083
But tell you what,
maybe we should have a chat first.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.883
I said, "I'm hungry."

41:37.036 --> 41:38.037
