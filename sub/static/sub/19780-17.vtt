WEBVTT

00:03.974 --> 00:05.774
Gonna give you kisses.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

00:05.776 --> 00:07.976
Among the many perils of me
having time off

00:07.978 --> 00:10.778
is increasingly gourmet breakfasts.

00:10.780 --> 00:14.549
Oh, I think we can handle it, huh?

00:14.551 --> 00:16.884
I'm just gonna try some.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.554
Mmm. Want some?

00:19.556 --> 00:22.057
What did you put in this
omelette? It's amazing.

00:22.059 --> 00:24.559
- Wait till you try the coffee.
- I like jobless Daddy.

00:24.561 --> 00:26.528
He can cook for us all the time.

00:28.031 --> 00:30.230
Hey.

00:30.232 --> 00:31.933
Aren't we missing a step?

00:31.935 --> 00:33.568
We're gonna do all the steps,

00:33.570 --> 00:36.303
it's just planning the
honeymoon's always the most fun.

00:36.305 --> 00:39.106
I think we need to hurry
in case we want to avoid,

00:39.108 --> 00:41.208
um, baby makes four at 30,000 feet.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.510
You're right. Let's not over-think it.

00:43.512 --> 00:44.978
Let's be spontaneous.

00:44.980 --> 00:48.515
Why don't we go for a drive?

00:48.517 --> 00:52.686
And... ah, ah...
we see a place we like,

00:52.688 --> 00:56.190
we'll, um, we'll do it this weekend.

00:56.192 --> 00:58.592
You want to get married this weekend?

00:58.594 --> 01:00.393
I don't think planning's ever
worked for us before,

01:00.395 --> 01:01.761
so I think it's time to shake it up.

01:01.763 --> 01:04.163
I know, but there's so much
to think about.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.565
I have to write new vows.

01:05.567 --> 01:08.534
I have to get a dress that fits
me in this current state.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.436
And I don't think our
marriage license is valid,

01:10.438 --> 01:12.839
- so I think we...
- Hey.

01:12.841 --> 01:14.173
I love you.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.842
And we waited long enough.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.545
Let's do this.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.848
Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.918
Mm.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.861
Okay, so most people, when asked
to complete sexual history,

01:35.863 --> 01:37.930
don't go into such historical detail.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.398
"It all started behind the
portables in grade seven."

01:40.400 --> 01:43.335
I-I'm just trying to provide
the whole picture.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.971
A-Anything could be important.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.606
Right, and usually I'd agree.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.908
But this is like a novel,
and not the good kind.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.477
The kind where nothing happens,

01:52.479 --> 01:55.447
until the chapter about having
unprotected sex

01:55.449 --> 01:57.081
with a professional last week.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.783
Where's that going?

01:58.785 --> 02:02.053
You just close your eyes
and think of the portables.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.991
20 bucks says penile swab.

02:06.993 --> 02:09.026
You're on.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.896
Who bet on swab?

02:11.898 --> 02:15.232
Damn it. Every time.

02:15.234 --> 02:16.734
Never bet against Jackson.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.335
I wouldn't have to
if I wasn't so bored.

02:18.337 --> 02:19.303
It's been too slow today.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.772
- Hey.
- Zip it.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.873
No way, I'm not buying
into your dumb superstition.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.608
- They're not superstitions.
- They're rules.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.644
Sekara, we live by them.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.245
If you're in a betting mood,
how about this?

02:28.247 --> 02:30.080
Next patient through the door's
gonna be a major pain

02:30.082 --> 02:31.615
and it will be all
your fault... 50 bucks.

02:31.617 --> 02:33.016
All right.

02:33.018 --> 02:34.151
All right.

02:34.153 --> 02:35.653
- Dr. Miller?
- Okay, here we go.

02:37.523 --> 02:38.656
It's just a guy with a cough.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.823
Howdy, sir, what's your name?

02:39.825 --> 02:42.125
Randy. Sorry, I can't stop.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.226
Oh, thank you.

02:43.228 --> 02:44.761
Okay, you just come with me over here.

02:44.763 --> 02:46.496
Hey, uh, guys, is there a...

02:46.498 --> 02:47.831
do you have a phone? Pay phone?

02:47.833 --> 02:49.666
'Cause I-I'm late for a job interview.

02:49.668 --> 02:50.934
I just got to make a quick call.

02:50.936 --> 02:52.836
Let's first have a seat here, okay?

02:52.838 --> 02:54.805
Why don't you just take it easy
and breathe for us.

02:54.807 --> 02:55.805
All right.

02:57.942 --> 03:00.109
Okay, you, uh...

03:00.111 --> 03:01.344
You don't have a fever,

03:01.346 --> 03:03.213
but you're definitely
a little bit jaundiced.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.682
Oh, no, that's just, uh, where I live.

03:05.684 --> 03:09.018
No-window basement apartment.
Full of mold.

03:09.020 --> 03:12.154
Okay, well, you need to talk
to your landlord about that.

03:12.156 --> 03:14.190
No point now. They're kicking me out.

03:14.192 --> 03:17.392
I can't manage first and last
at a new place.

03:17.394 --> 03:19.361
I'm barely covering the rent as it is.

03:19.363 --> 03:20.429
You know how it is, right?

03:20.431 --> 03:21.530
Yeah, why don't you slide down
and relax?

03:21.532 --> 03:22.698
And we'll run you some tests. Okay?

03:22.700 --> 03:23.966
Put the feet up, it's okay?

03:23.968 --> 03:25.000
Yeah. Please.

03:25.002 --> 03:27.837
Hey, th-th-the pay phone?

03:27.839 --> 03:31.506
Here, use mine. You can use it.

03:31.508 --> 03:32.574
Thank you.

03:32.576 --> 03:33.675
Yeah, no worries.

03:33.677 --> 03:37.011
Looks like you really need
this job pretty bad.

03:37.013 --> 03:38.480
That was nice.

03:40.884 --> 03:43.385
Hi, Mr. Trottier, Randy Rogen speaking.

03:43.387 --> 03:44.786
Yes. I know.

03:44.788 --> 03:47.488
Crazy thing, I woke up sick
and I just jumped

03:47.490 --> 03:49.357
into the hospital real quick.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.060
I'm hoping we can reschedule
the interview for...

03:52.062 --> 03:55.596
I've had some interesting...

03:55.598 --> 03:57.732
Yes, I understand.

04:00.003 --> 04:02.169
Thank you.

04:02.171 --> 04:04.071
Sorry.

04:04.073 --> 04:07.040
Here, let me grab that for you.

04:09.712 --> 04:11.345
Guess it's not my day.

04:17.754 --> 04:20.654
It's beautiful. Looks like
they're having a wedding.

04:20.656 --> 04:22.622
A wedding, huh? Could be a sign.

04:22.624 --> 04:24.691
No, Charlie, that's a sign.

04:24.693 --> 04:27.294
I mean, how weird is that?

04:27.296 --> 04:29.729
Oh, this is cute.

04:29.731 --> 04:31.865
Let's keep it simple.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.400
- Just a few close friends?
- Mm-hmm.

04:33.402 --> 04:34.867
And my brothers, if I can get them.

04:34.869 --> 04:36.235
Ooh, can we have croquembouche?

04:36.237 --> 04:37.904
Yeah, if you tell me what that is.

04:37.906 --> 04:39.506
It is a French pastry tower.

04:39.508 --> 04:41.741
You can have that if I get
a nacho cheese fountain.

04:41.743 --> 04:43.976
It's a deal.

04:43.978 --> 04:45.812
Have you seen a man in a tux?

04:45.814 --> 04:48.281
Uh, yeah. Yeah, once or twice.

04:48.283 --> 04:49.749
We seem to have lost the groom.

04:49.751 --> 04:51.083
Poor girl.

04:51.085 --> 04:52.518
Apparently this isn't the first time

04:52.520 --> 04:53.752
she's been left at the altar.

04:53.754 --> 04:56.689
- Uh, we'll keep an eye out.
- Thanks.

04:56.691 --> 04:59.025
Let's hit the road
before things get ugly.

04:59.027 --> 05:00.759
Foster?

05:00.761 --> 05:01.894
Yeah, let's book the space

05:01.896 --> 05:03.262
and leave the bride to her special day.

05:03.264 --> 05:04.763
- Let's go.
- Foster?

05:04.765 --> 05:06.098
Foster, where are you?

05:06.100 --> 05:06.833
Ah!

05:06.835 --> 05:07.533
Oh.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:21.366 --> 05:22.667
I'm a doctor. My name's Alex.

05:22.669 --> 05:24.035
What's your name?

05:24.037 --> 05:25.837
This is so embarrassing.
Please, just help me up.

05:25.839 --> 05:27.204
- What's her name?
- Nadine.

05:27.206 --> 05:29.140
Nadine, try to stay still, all right?

05:29.142 --> 05:31.108
You had a big fall.
I need to check you out.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.210
Am I bleeding? Don't get blood
on the dress, please.

05:33.212 --> 05:34.345
I'm getting married today.

05:34.347 --> 05:36.047
I know you are, and I love the dress.

05:36.049 --> 05:37.681
Thank you. You are so sweet.

05:37.683 --> 05:39.517
Charlie, you want to
check out this leg?

05:39.519 --> 05:40.784
Yep.

05:40.786 --> 05:43.620
Hope Zion is expecting her.

05:43.622 --> 05:45.423
Where's Foster?
I have to find him. I...

05:45.425 --> 05:47.090
Ugh. He's here, right?

05:47.092 --> 05:48.425
We're doing this?

05:48.427 --> 05:49.492
You want to try not to think

05:49.494 --> 05:50.861
about any of those things right now.

05:50.863 --> 05:52.429
You just try to stay calm
and we'll take good care of you.

05:52.431 --> 05:55.799
I can still walk down
the aisle, though, right?

06:04.008 --> 06:06.576
Hey.

06:06.578 --> 06:08.944
You look elegant today.

06:08.946 --> 06:10.212
Really?

06:10.214 --> 06:12.281
Because I have a meeting with producers

06:12.283 --> 06:15.385
on that, you know,
"doctor thing" show tonight,

06:15.387 --> 06:17.553
so it'll be a miracle if any
of this elegance

06:17.555 --> 06:19.321
actually makes it through the day.

06:19.323 --> 06:21.156
You know, trauma isn't glamorous.

06:21.158 --> 06:23.525
No, I know, but plastics
is supposed to be, right?

06:23.527 --> 06:25.294
And that's... the show.

06:25.296 --> 06:27.629
'Cause apparently
an emergency bowel repair

06:27.631 --> 06:30.900
can't compete with a feel-good
face-lift for a single mom.

06:30.902 --> 06:33.735
- That sounds...
- Like a step backwards, right?

06:33.737 --> 06:35.604
I know, and I haven't taken
the job yet,

06:35.606 --> 06:39.574
but trauma,
it's thrilling and exciting

06:39.576 --> 06:42.076
and exhausting, honestly.

06:42.078 --> 06:44.546
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

06:44.548 --> 06:46.481
Well, there's no shame in running away

06:46.483 --> 06:48.216
the moment things get difficult.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.287
Thank you for your support, Shahir.

06:54.291 --> 06:57.392
You okay?
What's going on with Jonathan?

06:57.667 --> 07:00.161
He... we...

07:00.163 --> 07:03.264
You know, I have to break up with him.

07:04.713 --> 07:05.599
No...

07:05.601 --> 07:09.670
after all the great relationship
advice I have given you?

07:10.240 --> 07:11.371
Okay, I'm late for rounds.

07:11.373 --> 07:12.606
I'm going to come with you.

07:12.608 --> 07:13.808
Hang on.

07:14.421 --> 07:16.287
I'm still in trauma as of now,

07:16.287 --> 07:18.512
and what you're going through
qualifies as traumatic.

07:18.514 --> 07:20.113
So where are we going?

07:20.115 --> 07:23.183
- I really appreciate this.
- Yeah.

07:23.185 --> 07:25.319
I mean, with Dr. Reid going
on mat. leave

07:25.321 --> 07:26.820
and Dr. Williams leaving us,

07:26.822 --> 07:28.956
we could definitely use
an extra gen. surg.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.157
around here for a while.

07:30.159 --> 07:33.293
Especially one as talented as you.

07:33.295 --> 07:35.762
Well, I plan on drowning
my loneliness in work,

07:35.764 --> 07:37.364
so hit me with all you got.

07:37.366 --> 07:39.032
Thank you.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.501
Hey, listen. Uh...

07:41.503 --> 07:44.437
about everything that went down
with Charlie.

07:44.439 --> 07:45.939
Should I be worried?

07:48.610 --> 07:50.142
Ah, Jeremy, I don't know.

07:50.144 --> 07:51.811
I mean, he needed a break.

07:51.813 --> 07:54.113
He took it, so that's good.

07:54.115 --> 07:55.515
Do you think it's the kind of break

07:55.517 --> 07:56.916
that he's not gonna come back from?

07:56.918 --> 07:59.185
Charlie Harris is gonna walk
back into an O.R.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.820
The guy's ego is too big to not
swing around a scalpel.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.424
I think he's gonna wait until
his little girl is born

08:05.426 --> 08:07.793
- before he does, though.
- I hope so.

08:07.795 --> 08:10.229
And, hey, in the meantime,
he's got a wedding to plan.

08:10.231 --> 08:12.898
Ah, they're finally getting married.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.200
Good for them.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.201
Yeah.

08:16.203 --> 08:17.736
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:17.738 --> 08:20.038
Dr. Scott, what can I do for you?

08:20.040 --> 08:23.241
Uh, I wanted to talk about my shifts.

08:23.243 --> 08:24.710
All right. Well, get in
on as many surgeries

08:24.712 --> 08:26.512
as you can because I am short-staffed.

08:26.514 --> 08:28.480
It's the opposite, actually.

08:28.482 --> 08:31.049
Never heard a resident say that before.

08:31.051 --> 08:32.884
Does this have something to do
with what happened

08:32.885 --> 08:34.219
with Dr. Williams and her patient?

08:34.221 --> 08:36.921
No, no, no. I just, uh, I need
a bit of a break.

08:36.923 --> 08:40.525
Because you were defending
Cassie and yourself

08:40.527 --> 08:42.860
and so you know that if you
need to take some time...

08:42.861 --> 08:44.261
I don't... I don't want time.

08:44.264 --> 08:46.264
I want to work. I just...
I need a break from the O.R.,

08:46.266 --> 08:50.134
so if you wouldn't mind maybe
putting me on rounds or ICU,

08:50.136 --> 08:51.536
anything else?

08:51.538 --> 08:54.405
Okay. See what I can do.

08:54.407 --> 08:57.642
Billy?

08:57.644 --> 09:00.645
You're not the only one
who has experienced trauma

09:00.647 --> 09:03.714
here at this hospital,
so if you ever want to talk.

09:03.716 --> 09:05.549
Thanks.

09:05.551 --> 09:09.786
Thank you, Dr. Bell, but no, I'm fine.

09:10.698 --> 09:12.989
Trying to start a family
has been quite stressful

09:12.991 --> 09:14.124
on our relationship.

09:14.126 --> 09:16.260
Eating and sleeping is quite difficult,

09:16.262 --> 09:17.394
and Jonathan's worse.

09:17.396 --> 09:18.695
He started baking again.

09:18.697 --> 09:20.397
Oof, that's not sustainable.

09:20.399 --> 09:21.498
No, it is not.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.832
I would eat 1,000 quinoa-goji cookies

09:22.834 --> 09:24.467
if we could go back to the old us.

09:24.469 --> 09:25.602
Thank you.

09:25.604 --> 09:26.903
But failure to adopt a child

09:26.905 --> 09:29.372
has come to symbolize the
failure in our relationship.

09:29.374 --> 09:30.774
It's not fair, Dana.

09:30.776 --> 09:32.508
Have you tried telling him this?

09:32.510 --> 09:33.977
- I tried.
- Try harder.

09:33.979 --> 09:36.012
It seems like there's always
another adoption form

09:36.014 --> 09:37.246
or a parenting class,

09:37.248 --> 09:38.747
and then when we lose out
on yet another kid,

09:38.749 --> 09:41.217
it's a disappointment.

09:41.219 --> 09:43.386
Well, my ex and I thought having a baby

09:43.388 --> 09:45.221
would bring us closer together,

09:45.223 --> 09:47.156
and you know how that story ended.

09:47.158 --> 09:48.791
What are we doing up here?

09:48.793 --> 09:50.926
We are monitoring brain activity

09:50.928 --> 09:53.296
on our coma patients for a new study.

09:53.298 --> 09:54.363
Well, on the bright side,

09:54.365 --> 09:56.031
I guess you're looking at a whole day

09:56.033 --> 09:57.032
of "It could be worse."

10:01.105 --> 10:03.672
I thought you said
these were coma patients.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.307
They are.

10:07.444 --> 10:08.944
- Liam, you're up.
- What, what, what?

10:08.946 --> 10:11.080
What... what... what happened to me?

10:11.082 --> 10:12.380
What happened to me?

10:12.382 --> 10:14.949
Well, it looks like you broke
your nose when you fell,

10:14.951 --> 10:16.651
but, hey, you're awake.

10:16.653 --> 10:17.819
Welcome back!

10:17.821 --> 10:19.954
How long's he been in a coma?

10:19.956 --> 10:22.991
- Three weeks.
- What happened to my hair?

10:22.993 --> 10:25.327
And why do I look so old?

10:25.329 --> 10:29.263
Uh, Liam, how old do you think you are?

10:29.265 --> 10:31.699
Dude, I just turned 19.

10:36.606 --> 10:40.341
Decreased air entry.

10:40.343 --> 10:41.809
You got family?

10:41.811 --> 10:42.910
Anyone we can call?

10:42.912 --> 10:44.078
No. Nobody.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.014
- You sure?
- Hey, could you write me a note?

10:47.016 --> 10:48.749
I got to see if I can get the guy

10:48.751 --> 10:50.884
to give me another shot
at that interview.

10:50.886 --> 10:54.488
I need this job, or I'll wind up
on the street again.

10:54.490 --> 10:55.722
All right, let's not go charging

10:55.724 --> 10:56.957
out of here just yet, Mr. Rogen.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.359
At least wait for your test results.

10:58.361 --> 11:01.461
Hey, don't forget that note. Thank you!

11:01.463 --> 11:04.497
Okay, so, results are back.
He's got a lung infection

11:04.499 --> 11:07.467
from the mold... no surprise
there... but he's also...

11:07.469 --> 11:09.402
he's end-stage liver failure.

11:10.405 --> 11:11.738
Is he a drinker?

11:11.740 --> 11:13.707
Tox screen's clear for alcohol.

11:13.709 --> 11:16.743
So, either hepatitis,
acetaminophen overdose,

11:16.745 --> 11:17.910
suppurative cholangitis?

11:17.912 --> 11:19.095
Whatever it is,
with results like these,

11:19.095 --> 11:20.186
he doesn't have much time.

11:20.186 --> 11:22.116
Well, you two send him up to
imaging to confirm,

11:22.116 --> 11:23.583
and I'll start on
the transplant paperwork

11:23.585 --> 11:24.850
and have it ready when you're done.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.186
Can't have a transplant.

11:26.188 --> 11:28.321
What are you talking about?

11:28.323 --> 11:30.190
Right, he's been evicted.

11:30.192 --> 11:32.058
No stable housing to convalesce...

11:32.060 --> 11:33.593
No new liver. Those are the rules.

11:33.595 --> 11:35.995
Okay, the guy just found out
that he's being evicted.

11:35.997 --> 11:37.429
That's not fair.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.765
He's got no family to take him in?

11:39.767 --> 11:40.866
He's got no one.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.975
The ceremony is in a few hours.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.344
Where is he?

11:52.346 --> 11:54.913
Foster, he wouldn't do this to me.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.148
Nadine, why don't you think
about good things?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.351
Why don't you tell me
about how you first met?

11:59.353 --> 12:01.486
Okay. Um... uh, yeah.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.856
I was hiking on the West Coast Trail.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.759
A week by myself, and Foster,

12:07.761 --> 12:11.696
he just comes walking out of the
rainforest all like, "Hello."

12:11.698 --> 12:14.632
So cute.

12:14.634 --> 12:18.302
Honestly, I think... I think
the moment I saw him, I...

12:18.304 --> 12:20.404
You just knew?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.507
Only he was going the other way
and I got his e-mail,

12:23.509 --> 12:24.842
but it totally got soaked,

12:24.844 --> 12:27.445
and then all I had was this
photo that I'd taken.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.247
And I showed it to everybody
that I met.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.748
I looked all over for him.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.619
So then, a year later...
like to the date...

12:34.621 --> 12:37.855
I'm on a day trip on the Bruce Trail,

12:37.857 --> 12:39.923
and... just to clear my head, you know?

12:39.925 --> 12:43.593
And... there he is, again.

12:43.595 --> 12:44.661
That's amazing.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.864
It's the same date, today.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.799
We're supposed to get married.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.934
That's got to be good luck, right?

12:50.936 --> 12:52.836
Are you two married?

12:52.838 --> 12:54.604
We're working on it.

12:55.941 --> 13:00.677
If Foster and I are
meant to be, then...

13:00.679 --> 13:03.480
why did...

13:03.482 --> 13:05.515
why did this happen?

13:06.618 --> 13:07.450
Pressure's dropping.

13:07.452 --> 13:09.786
She's going into shock.

13:12.824 --> 13:15.391
Ouch. Horse-drawn carriage collision

13:15.393 --> 13:17.359
or rabid bridesmaid bouquet tackle?

13:17.361 --> 13:19.495
Stair fall. Open tibial fracture,

13:19.497 --> 13:21.230
pressure's dropping,
could be internal bleeding.

13:21.232 --> 13:23.666
On three... one, two, three.

13:23.668 --> 13:25.034
Okay.

13:25.036 --> 13:26.669
Let's cut this dress off...
she looks like a meringue.

13:26.671 --> 13:28.370
Don't you dare.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.438
Uh, you know what I'll do?

13:29.440 --> 13:30.972
I'll... I'll just cut it
along the seam.

13:30.974 --> 13:32.708
You'll be able to fix it good
as new, all right?

13:32.710 --> 13:35.177
Did you talk to Foster?

13:35.179 --> 13:36.412
Went straight to voicemail,

13:36.414 --> 13:37.780
but I'm sure he's trying to find
out where you are.

13:37.782 --> 13:39.782
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to
get this dress cut off.

13:39.784 --> 13:41.149
So let's do it now,
gonna have to run a FAST.

13:41.151 --> 13:43.285
Knife?

13:43.287 --> 13:45.220
Mr. Rogen, where are you going?

13:45.222 --> 13:46.454
I got to go. Thank you.

13:46.456 --> 13:48.489
No, no. Jackson, get him
into bed right now.

13:48.491 --> 13:51.092
And let's get Sekara down here.
We're gonna need an O.R.

13:51.094 --> 13:54.129
All right, bud. Okay. Hang in there.

13:54.131 --> 13:56.798
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:58.850 --> 14:00.918
Remarkable.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.719
Just remarkable.

14:02.721 --> 14:04.955
Okay, so... so, where am I?

14:04.957 --> 14:07.358
And who... who are you?

14:07.360 --> 14:09.493
Wh-what did you do to my face?

14:09.495 --> 14:11.862
Well, in order... Hope Zion Hospital,

14:11.864 --> 14:14.397
Dr. Kinney and Dr. Hamza,

14:14.399 --> 14:17.267
nothing yet, but hold still.

14:18.971 --> 14:20.236
Good as new.

14:20.238 --> 14:21.237
Ow.

14:21.239 --> 14:22.405
Still got it.

14:22.407 --> 14:25.008
Uh, I don't remember.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.543
Uh...

14:26.545 --> 14:28.044
I was walking to my girlfriend's house,

14:28.046 --> 14:29.979
and we were gonna head out
and see the Goo Goo Dolls.

14:29.981 --> 14:31.114
When was that exactly?

14:31.116 --> 14:33.349
Um, I can see the tickets in my hand.

14:33.351 --> 14:34.917
It was, uh, Au... August 30th.

14:34.919 --> 14:37.387
- What year?
- 1997.

14:37.389 --> 14:40.490
Oh, my God. Jenny,
my girlfriend, is she okay?

14:40.492 --> 14:43.926
Liam, you were involved in
an accident bicycling to work.

14:43.928 --> 14:45.561
Three weeks ago, and it's currently

14:45.563 --> 14:46.996
the year of our Lord 20...

14:48.066 --> 14:51.067
2-2000 and what, lady?

14:51.069 --> 14:52.334
Lady?

14:52.336 --> 14:53.502
2000 and what?

14:53.504 --> 14:55.838
The accident caused a brain hemorrhage,

14:55.840 --> 14:57.306
and you went into a coma.

14:57.308 --> 15:01.110
Oh... this is a dream.

15:01.112 --> 15:02.677
I am dreaming.

15:02.679 --> 15:06.715
Okay, I'm 19. It's 1997.

15:06.717 --> 15:09.251
And this is a dream.

15:09.253 --> 15:11.753
Liam, you've just turned 40.

15:11.755 --> 15:12.854
Ow!

15:15.792 --> 15:17.125
You need to stop talking.

15:17.127 --> 15:18.192
I what now?

15:18.194 --> 15:19.560
You cannot tell him how old he is

15:19.562 --> 15:20.729
or what year it is. Not yet.

15:20.731 --> 15:22.764
But you're going to let
this middle-aged buddy

15:22.766 --> 15:24.265
think that he is a teenager?

15:24.267 --> 15:25.734
We don't want to overwhelm him.

15:25.736 --> 15:27.468
His brain is under too much stress.

15:27.470 --> 15:30.338
I-I need to read up on his imaging a...

15:30.340 --> 15:31.940
His wife comes every day.

15:31.942 --> 15:33.307
I don't know how he's going
to react to her.

15:33.309 --> 15:34.675
- Is her name Jenny?
- No.

15:34.677 --> 15:37.411
Well, then, probably not well.

15:37.413 --> 15:39.347
Dr. Scott!

15:39.349 --> 15:41.882
Let's move our patient here
off the coma ward.

15:41.884 --> 15:44.018
What's the rush? He just woke up.

15:44.020 --> 15:45.719
Just find him a ward bed.

15:45.721 --> 15:48.322
There's, uh, precedents
for this kind of memory loss.

15:48.324 --> 15:50.758
I need to read up on it
before I update his wife.

15:52.427 --> 15:55.996
Hey, I finally got hold of the groom.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.766
- He's, um, on his way.
- Good.

15:58.768 --> 16:00.200
How's her imaging looking?

16:00.202 --> 16:01.702
It is bad.

16:01.704 --> 16:03.170
Traumatic aortic injury,

16:03.172 --> 16:05.338
and the blood from the tear
caused a pseudo-aneurysm.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.641
So, major surgery on her wedding day.

16:07.643 --> 16:09.543
Sounds familiar.

16:09.545 --> 16:11.278
Yeah. I'm just trying to track down

16:11.280 --> 16:14.347
Dr. Turser so I can brief her
on this tibial fracture.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.115
Oh. Right.

16:16.117 --> 16:18.351
Forgot I don't work here
anymore? Me too.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.119
I did.

16:20.121 --> 16:22.088
Good luck with her.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.456
Charlie, can I talk to you
about something?

16:24.458 --> 16:27.626
Yeah. Sure.

16:27.628 --> 16:29.762
Do you think we caused this?

16:32.067 --> 16:36.635
Alex, what happened today was
happening with or without us.

16:36.637 --> 16:39.605
I miss scientists
who believe in curses.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.341
I do understand how crazy it sounds.

16:42.343 --> 16:44.577
It's not crazy. Who are you talking to?

16:44.579 --> 16:46.111
I-I just think that maybe

16:46.113 --> 16:48.714
this is our chance
to break free of this.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.382
You know, if... if we can give
Nadine a happy ending,

16:50.384 --> 16:51.483
then maybe we...

16:51.485 --> 16:53.252
Maybe we can get one ourselves.

16:55.289 --> 16:56.755
Forget it. It's stupid.

16:56.757 --> 16:58.656
It's not stupid...

16:58.658 --> 17:00.892
if you believe it.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.560
And if you believe it,

17:02.562 --> 17:05.997
then maybe you should go
in there and fix her.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
Okay.

17:08.001 --> 17:09.634
Okay.

17:13.373 --> 17:16.273
All right. There you go, man.

17:16.276 --> 17:17.808
You rest easy.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.544
Thank you, man.

17:19.546 --> 17:22.046
That's a huge pager.

17:24.183 --> 17:28.152
Yeah, um, is there anything else
I can do for you, Liam?

17:28.154 --> 17:31.756
Yeah. You know, I'd really like
to talk to my mom and dad.

17:31.758 --> 17:33.958
Arthur and Gail Quinn.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.394
I... can't remember their number.

17:37.396 --> 17:39.696
Is it... It must be on my chart there.

17:39.698 --> 17:42.733
Um, there's just, you know,
there's no number here,

17:42.735 --> 17:46.035
so, let me see what I can find out.

17:46.037 --> 17:50.006
And here, this ought to keep you
entertained in the meantime.

17:50.008 --> 17:52.709
What is it? What is this?

17:56.682 --> 17:58.715
The blood clot caused by his accident

17:58.717 --> 18:01.618
caused a 20-year gap
in his long-term memory.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.653
But he can get them back, yes?

18:03.655 --> 18:07.190
Yes, it's possible in time
the brain can rewire itself

18:07.192 --> 18:08.591
to circumvent dead brain cells.

18:08.593 --> 18:10.726
Then you should tell him everything

18:10.728 --> 18:12.328
and try and trigger it coming back.

18:12.330 --> 18:15.799
No, no. Not yet. That's...
That's too overwhelming.

18:17.302 --> 18:20.536
You avoid difficult conversations.

18:20.538 --> 18:22.471
That's not true.

18:22.473 --> 18:24.340
It's the same with telling Jonathan

18:24.342 --> 18:25.608
about how you're feeling.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.643
You can't handle the emotional fallout.

18:27.645 --> 18:30.279
Okay, Dr. Kinney,
this isn't your patient.

18:30.281 --> 18:31.847
This isn't even your office.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.582
The whole reason why you're here

18:33.584 --> 18:36.551
is to put off telling Dawn Bell
that you can't handle trauma.

18:36.553 --> 18:38.420
That was a low blow, Hamza.

18:38.422 --> 18:39.621
Well, it doesn't matter

18:39.623 --> 18:41.690
how complicated our lives
are right now.

18:41.692 --> 18:45.593
This young... middle-aged man...
his... his problems are worse.

18:45.595 --> 18:47.963
If he can't remember 20 years
of his life,

18:47.965 --> 18:50.899
then he can't remember
that both his parents are dead.

18:50.901 --> 18:54.101
He has to experience that grief
all over again.

18:54.103 --> 18:57.271
At least we get to decide
whether to put off our problems

18:57.273 --> 18:58.506
or to deal with them.

18:58.508 --> 19:00.742
The longer you keep him from knowing,

19:00.744 --> 19:02.944
the longer you keep him from coping.

19:11.487 --> 19:13.020
Thank you.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.893
Excuse me. Hi. You must be Foster.

19:18.895 --> 19:21.195
I'm Dr. Reid. I am Nadine's doctor.

19:21.197 --> 19:22.964
I can't believe this is
happening to her.

19:22.966 --> 19:24.431
I-I-It's all my fault.

19:24.433 --> 19:25.766
It was an accident.

19:25.768 --> 19:27.735
No, no. I-I-I didn't leave her.

19:27.737 --> 19:30.170
I wasn't running. It just...

19:30.172 --> 19:33.340
It came over me that my vows,
they didn't do her justice.

19:33.342 --> 19:36.510
I just wanted some space, some quiet,

19:36.512 --> 19:37.745
so I can make them better.

19:37.747 --> 19:39.880
And you didn't tell anybody?

19:39.882 --> 19:42.849
Stupid. I just needed a space

19:42.851 --> 19:46.253
so that I could put into words
how I feel about her.

19:46.255 --> 19:49.522
You know, no jokes, no cliches,

19:49.524 --> 19:51.091
just... pbht!

19:51.093 --> 19:52.492
My he... My heart spilled out,

19:52.494 --> 19:54.861
no matter how embarrassing it got.

19:54.863 --> 19:56.596
Please, tell me I'll get a chance

19:56.598 --> 19:58.063
to say these things to her.

19:58.065 --> 19:59.432
Oh, I'm going to do a procedure

19:59.434 --> 20:00.966
that will stop the internal bleeding,

20:00.968 --> 20:02.568
and then we have an orthopedic surgeon

20:02.570 --> 20:03.703
that's gonna fix her leg.

20:03.705 --> 20:05.237
Her condition is still very serious.

20:07.275 --> 20:09.609
Look, I know that this feels
like the end of the world,

20:09.611 --> 20:11.277
but if you guys can get through this,

20:11.279 --> 20:12.712
you will be stronger than ever.

20:12.714 --> 20:15.381
Will you tell her that I'm here?

20:15.383 --> 20:18.350
Like, even if she's asleep, tell her.

20:18.352 --> 20:21.653
I will. I promise, okay?

20:21.655 --> 20:23.022
Okay.

20:29.530 --> 20:30.629
What's happening to him?

20:30.631 --> 20:31.897
Liver's not filtering toxins anymore.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.197
They're building up in his brain.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.734
- Take it.
- I don't want your money.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.602
Just take it, please.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.770
Guys, what's up?

20:38.772 --> 20:40.539
I'm doing an endoscopic sclerotherapy

20:40.541 --> 20:42.741
with Dr. Bishop to stop
the esophageal bleeding.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.142
It should buy us some time.

20:44.144 --> 20:45.577
Get him on the transplant list?

20:45.579 --> 20:47.611
Not until his living situation's
been resolved.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.380
You can't just get him a liver
and work this out afterwards?

20:49.382 --> 20:52.317
No. So, you go work your magic
with Bishop.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.651
I have an idea.

21:08.519 --> 21:09.702
Oh, great. Thank you very much.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.217
That was very kind of you, Doctor...

21:12.394 --> 21:14.924
You don't know my name,
do you, Dr. Miller?

21:14.926 --> 21:17.794
I know your work,
and that's more important.

21:17.796 --> 21:22.031
Thank you, Doctor... Taylor!

21:22.033 --> 21:23.466
Dr. Taylor.

21:23.468 --> 21:25.635
So, the sclerotherapy went well.

21:25.637 --> 21:27.003
Esophageal bleeding stopped,

21:27.005 --> 21:29.038
but his bilirubin levels
are still a nightmare.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.472
- Okay.
- How are we doing on housing?

21:30.474 --> 21:32.508
I found a nurse that was renting
out a bachelor apartment.

21:32.510 --> 21:34.577
I raised 500 bucks. I'm just
gonna pitch in the rest myself.

21:34.579 --> 21:35.417
So, he's on the list?

21:35.424 --> 21:38.414
He's on the list. Now we just
need to find a liver.

21:38.416 --> 21:40.783
Yeah. I found your number on him.

21:40.785 --> 21:44.220
Listen, um

21:44.222 --> 21:48.123
He's not doing so great right now.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.926
Okay?

21:50.928 --> 21:52.428
Bye.

21:55.633 --> 21:58.534
You shouldn't have done that.

21:58.536 --> 21:59.801
I called your son.

21:59.803 --> 22:01.002
You spoke with my son?

22:01.004 --> 22:03.972
You said you didn't have any family.

22:03.974 --> 22:07.175
Nobody's coming, right?

22:07.177 --> 22:09.010
So...

22:09.012 --> 22:12.147
I don't have any family.

22:12.149 --> 22:14.315
Do you mind if I ask why?

22:14.317 --> 22:17.218
I wasn't very nice to them...

22:17.220 --> 22:20.321
or anyone.

22:20.323 --> 22:22.590
The big real estate man.

22:22.592 --> 22:26.093
All about the cash, flashing it around.

22:26.095 --> 22:30.398
The sleazy clubs and coke
and cars... You name it.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.533
Lost everything.

22:33.535 --> 22:35.803
Everyone.

22:35.805 --> 22:39.373
Don't expect them to forgive me.

22:39.375 --> 22:43.043
I just hope I get the chance
to prove I can still do good.

22:43.045 --> 22:45.445
Be worth something.

22:47.917 --> 22:49.883
You believe people can change?

22:51.687 --> 22:55.188
I see the same ODs coming
in here night after night.

22:55.190 --> 22:59.225
Same husbands saying their wife
walked into a door.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.269
My dad...

23:09.271 --> 23:11.604
My dad, he tried to change.

23:11.606 --> 23:13.606
It was too late for him,

23:13.608 --> 23:17.410
so I never got to find out
if it was for real.

23:17.412 --> 23:18.577
What happened?

23:18.579 --> 23:20.914
Liver failure.

23:20.916 --> 23:23.015
Same as you.

23:23.017 --> 23:24.483
I'm sorry.

23:24.485 --> 23:27.019
Yeah.

23:27.021 --> 23:29.288
About my wallet.

23:29.290 --> 23:30.356
I wanted you to have the money.

23:30.358 --> 23:31.324
No. It's...

23:31.326 --> 23:32.858
You take it. It's yours.

23:36.130 --> 23:39.298
Just don't let me die alone.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.866
Please.

23:40.868 --> 23:43.768
Hey... I got you.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.103
I'll be here for you,

23:45.105 --> 23:47.272
or I'll make sure someone else is.

23:47.274 --> 23:51.509
That makes you the best friend
I have in the world.

23:51.511 --> 23:53.078
So...

23:55.115 --> 23:56.748
thanks.

24:01.254 --> 24:02.920
Thank you.

24:07.193 --> 24:08.560
Yeah.

24:19.739 --> 24:22.639
Uh, Elyse! Elyse. Mrs. Quinn. Hi.

24:22.641 --> 24:25.243
Dr. Hamza, I've been looking
all over for my husband.

24:25.245 --> 24:26.911
You moved him. Has he woken up?

24:26.913 --> 24:28.979
Yes, he has, but it appears, though,

24:28.981 --> 24:30.716
uh, he has lost some of his memory.

24:30.716 --> 24:31.694
I need to see him.

24:31.694 --> 24:33.166
Well, he may not know who you are.

24:33.166 --> 24:34.551
He's my husband.

24:34.553 --> 24:35.753
Um...

24:35.755 --> 24:37.921
How much memory?

24:37.923 --> 24:39.656
- About...
- 20.

24:39.658 --> 24:41.157
20 years.

24:41.159 --> 24:42.708
We're not certain
if the loss is permanent,

24:42.708 --> 24:44.795
but to him, it's still 1997.

24:44.797 --> 24:47.264
Come on. You're kidding me.

24:47.266 --> 24:49.632
- Elyse.
- Liam! Oh, Liam!

24:49.634 --> 24:50.600
Oh, sweetheart.

24:50.602 --> 24:52.202
I am so glad that you're awake.

24:52.204 --> 24:53.203
- Whoa!
- Sweetie, I...

24:53.205 --> 24:54.371
Easy, lady.

24:54.373 --> 24:57.573
Liam, it's... Sweetie,
it's me. It's Elyse.

24:57.575 --> 24:59.876
You're, like, what, a friend
of my mom's or something?

24:59.878 --> 25:01.444
No. I'm... I'm your wife.

25:02.814 --> 25:05.347
We're married. 8 1/2 years?

25:05.349 --> 25:07.116
We have a house in the Junction.
Two dogs.

25:07.118 --> 25:10.319
I would like to see
my parents now, please.

25:10.321 --> 25:13.088
Both of your parents are dead, Liam.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.927
Whoever you are, get... get out.

25:17.929 --> 25:20.495
- Okay...
- Get out!

25:20.497 --> 25:22.497
Get out!

25:24.768 --> 25:26.101
Uh, Elyse.

25:26.103 --> 25:27.202
Elyse!

25:29.140 --> 25:31.840
Is it true what she said
about my mom and dad?

25:31.842 --> 25:34.043
You know, I am so sorry.

25:34.045 --> 25:35.744
We should have prepared you for this.

25:35.746 --> 25:36.845
We didn't mean for you to find...

25:36.847 --> 25:38.814
I don't want to talk anymore, okay?

25:38.816 --> 25:41.883
No more bad news.

25:43.487 --> 25:44.853
Can I...

25:44.855 --> 25:47.355
Could I just get some 3D Doritos

25:47.357 --> 25:49.658
and the Pepsi Blue, please?

25:49.660 --> 25:52.226
They don't make those anymore.

25:54.797 --> 25:56.230
All the...

25:56.232 --> 25:59.200
The future sucks.

25:59.202 --> 26:00.634
Yeah.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.141
Dawn.

26:07.143 --> 26:08.375
Charlie.

26:08.377 --> 26:10.778
Don't worry. I'm not here
to get my job back.

26:10.780 --> 26:12.613
I heard about you and Alex.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.682
Long time coming.

26:14.684 --> 26:16.016
Yeah. Actually, we were, uh,

26:16.018 --> 26:17.818
looking for a place to get
married today.

26:17.820 --> 26:20.087
Yes. I heard about
the unlucky bride, too.

26:22.157 --> 26:25.292
So, am I gonna get invited
to the wedding?

26:25.294 --> 26:27.927
Yeah. Yeah, if, uh, you, um,

26:27.929 --> 26:30.163
give Alex a little extra mat. leave,

26:30.165 --> 26:31.999
I'm sure there's something
we could work out.

26:32.001 --> 26:35.668
Charlie Harris, we are gonna miss you.

26:35.670 --> 26:37.537
I will.

26:37.539 --> 26:40.407
Me too.

26:43.712 --> 26:45.411
Charlie?

26:45.413 --> 26:49.315
After the baby's born,
when you're ready to come back,

26:49.317 --> 26:52.218
I hope that you'll call me first.

27:13.107 --> 27:15.507
Deploring the graft proximally.

27:15.509 --> 27:19.778
So, I hear you and Charlie
are getting hitched.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.780
Mazel Tov, Dr. Reid.

27:21.782 --> 27:24.449
Yeah. We were just apart for so long,

27:24.451 --> 27:26.885
we didn't want to waste any more time.

27:26.887 --> 27:30.121
What about you, Bishop?
You seeing anyone special?

27:30.123 --> 27:33.858
Have you talked to Dr. Williams
since you moved to New York?

27:33.860 --> 27:36.361
I was thinking about
dropping her a line.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.564
Or maybe, uh, a visit.

27:39.566 --> 27:42.167
Well, you should.

27:42.169 --> 27:44.835
What? You'll want a date
for our wedding.

27:47.574 --> 27:49.073
Memorial has a donor liver,

27:49.075 --> 27:51.175
but it's not a match for blood type.

27:51.177 --> 27:53.177
We're out of time.

27:53.179 --> 27:55.813
He doesn't have a relative that
can make a live donation?

27:55.815 --> 27:58.883
According to him, all those
bridges have been burned.

28:00.319 --> 28:02.252
I'm sorry we can't help him.

28:02.254 --> 28:04.020
At least we can make him
more comfortable.

28:04.022 --> 28:05.355
Hey, good news.

28:05.357 --> 28:07.091
I found a live donor for Mr. Rogen.

28:07.093 --> 28:08.459
How'd you do that?

28:08.461 --> 28:09.693
I'm a match.

28:09.695 --> 28:11.828
Jackson.

28:11.830 --> 28:13.230
No.

28:13.232 --> 28:14.664
That is a big surgery, Jackson.

28:14.666 --> 28:16.133
You need to think that through.

28:16.135 --> 28:17.934
Yeah. I have, and that's my decision,

28:17.936 --> 28:20.403
so let's make it happen.

28:32.285 --> 28:34.017
Foster?

28:34.019 --> 28:35.584
How is she?

28:35.586 --> 28:36.853
The surgery went well.

28:36.855 --> 28:39.588
The stent is in a good position,
and she's stable.

28:39.590 --> 28:41.724
Now Dr. Turser is working on her leg,

28:41.726 --> 28:44.027
and she feels confident
that in a few months,

28:44.029 --> 28:45.695
Nadine will be as good as new.

28:45.697 --> 28:48.397
Okay. Okay, this is good.

28:48.399 --> 28:50.032
All right. Is she awake?

28:50.034 --> 28:52.401
No. Not yet,
but you're the first face

28:52.403 --> 28:54.303
she'll see when she wakes up.

28:54.305 --> 28:57.373
Man, if I hadn't left,
this wouldn't have happened.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.875
I mean, it m... it meant
so much to her, to us,

28:59.877 --> 29:02.745
to get married on the day we met.

29:02.747 --> 29:05.080
She's superstitious like that.

29:05.082 --> 29:08.217
I wish I hadn't blown it for her.

29:08.219 --> 29:12.221
Hey. This got left in the E.R.
We should put it somewhere safe.

29:12.223 --> 29:15.590
I never got a chance to see her in it.

29:15.592 --> 29:17.893
Maybe it's not too late.

29:17.895 --> 29:20.028
Wait here. I'll be right back.

29:22.266 --> 29:24.432
- You're not doing this.
- Beg your pardon?

29:24.434 --> 29:26.133
Don't even understand
why you'd want to.

29:26.135 --> 29:27.402
You don't even know the guy.

29:27.404 --> 29:29.170
Okay, you just paid
for his new apartment.

29:29.172 --> 29:31.406
Yeah, a new apartment is not a liver.

29:31.408 --> 29:33.508
Jackson, you're risking infection,

29:33.510 --> 29:35.910
long-term intestinal damage,
bile leakage.

29:35.912 --> 29:39.180
Dr. Miller, I'm a grown man.
I can do what I want.

29:40.316 --> 29:42.649
Listen, you've heard a million
of these hard-luck stories.

29:42.651 --> 29:44.051
Why this guy?

29:44.053 --> 29:47.255
- I talked to his family.
- Okay. And I get it.

29:47.257 --> 29:48.990
He's a beautiful man, halo on his head,

29:48.992 --> 29:50.391
wouldn't hurt a fly.

29:50.393 --> 29:52.459
Nope. They hate him.

29:52.461 --> 29:55.296
They hate him? Okay, well,
now I'm even more confused.

29:55.298 --> 29:57.831
It was the same way with my father.

29:57.833 --> 29:59.700
He drank... a lot.

29:59.702 --> 30:02.102
After a while, the whole family
just shut him out,

30:02.104 --> 30:03.303
including me.

30:03.305 --> 30:05.739
A few later, he comes crawling back,

30:05.741 --> 30:07.374
saying he's gonna change.

30:07.376 --> 30:09.710
We all heard it all before.
No one believed him.

30:09.712 --> 30:11.412
No one gave him a second chance.

30:11.414 --> 30:14.915
He got sick. Died alone.

30:14.917 --> 30:17.683
He was sober.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.485
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:19.487 --> 30:21.454
The guy upstairs is not your father.

30:21.456 --> 30:22.889
Okay, I know. I just...

30:22.891 --> 30:27.593
I just feel like I owe somebody
a-a debt of faith.

30:27.595 --> 30:30.229
Does everything you do make sense?

30:30.231 --> 30:32.498
Okay, fine.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.467
Listen, logic isn't gonna
work with you.

30:34.469 --> 30:36.536
How about loyalty?
The hospital needs you.

30:36.538 --> 30:37.770
I need you.

30:37.772 --> 30:39.772
Everyone else who works here
is an idiot.

30:43.645 --> 30:45.744
Look, I had a bad feeling this morning,

30:45.746 --> 30:48.780
and it hasn't gone away, so just
give me a break, all right?

30:48.782 --> 30:50.149
Don't go through with this.

30:50.151 --> 30:51.516
We're gonna find a liver.

30:51.518 --> 30:53.018
No, we won't.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.753
And that's the point.

30:57.691 --> 31:00.025
Yes. Thank you.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.693
Well, now Liam wants plastic surgery,

31:01.695 --> 31:03.361
so we need to do something pretty...

31:04.898 --> 31:07.532
Yes. Yes. Thank you for the call.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.568
We'll give you our answer
by the end of the day.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.470
Bye.

31:11.472 --> 31:14.473
What is it? What's wrong?

31:14.475 --> 31:17.709
That was the adoption agency.

31:17.711 --> 31:21.112
They have a little girl in
Edmonton who needs a family...

31:21.114 --> 31:24.082
if we want her.

31:24.084 --> 31:26.150
Oh, Shahir.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.053
That's wonderful.

31:29.055 --> 31:32.290
I... can't do this. I can't...

31:32.292 --> 31:36.460
Dana, I can't have a baby to
save a relationship when...

31:38.698 --> 31:40.364
Finish the sentence.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.766
When my heart's not in it.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.837
And are you sure about that?

31:46.839 --> 31:48.839
You really don't want to be a father?

31:48.841 --> 31:51.741
Or are you just tired of the process?

31:53.312 --> 31:54.811
I don't know anymore.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.583
What's all this?

32:02.488 --> 32:04.721
Those are Liam's personal effects.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.323
- Oh.
- He left them in the coma ward.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.057
I'm going to bring it down to him.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.527
Oh, well, that's very nurturing
of you, Shahir.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.629
One might even say "paternal."

32:12.631 --> 32:14.397
Okay.

32:14.399 --> 32:17.400
Let's get his wife up here.
I have an idea.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.239
I got the consent form for you.

32:25.809 --> 32:27.743
I bet everyone's been trying
to talk you out of this,

32:27.745 --> 32:29.045
haven't they?

32:29.047 --> 32:30.946
Had about enough of it,
to tell you the truth.

32:30.948 --> 32:32.081
So, if you're next...

32:32.083 --> 32:33.982
Oh, I'm not going to join the pile.

32:33.984 --> 32:36.285
It's a good thing you're doing.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.020
The rest of your days,
you can walk around

32:38.022 --> 32:39.488
knowing someone got a second chance

32:39.490 --> 32:41.089
because you put your life on the line.

32:41.091 --> 32:42.658
Yeah. Uh, we could ease off

32:42.660 --> 32:43.525
with the
"life on the line" stuff.

32:43.527 --> 32:45.427
I'm just saying.

32:45.429 --> 32:47.696
We save lives around here all the time,

32:47.698 --> 32:49.831
but what you're doing is giving one.

32:49.833 --> 32:51.833
Good on ya.

32:53.336 --> 32:56.471
Hey. It's time to go up.

32:56.473 --> 32:58.440
I'm fine to walk, Dr. Sekara.

32:58.442 --> 33:00.075
Come on, Jackson. You're a patient now.

33:00.077 --> 33:02.610
You got to do what we say. Hop in.

33:02.612 --> 33:05.380
Okay.

33:21.965 --> 33:24.498
Brought the car back.
How is Nadine doing?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.333
She should wake up any time now.

33:26.335 --> 33:29.336
Not exactly the day they had
planned, but, um...

33:29.338 --> 33:31.371
It could still work out.

33:31.373 --> 33:33.507
Oh... Oh, no.

33:33.509 --> 33:36.876
You've got that dangerous
"Alex Reid with an idea" look.

33:36.878 --> 33:38.912
Charlie, let's see this through
for them.

33:38.914 --> 33:41.548
If Nadine truly believes that
this date is so special...

33:41.550 --> 33:45.652
What... Are you talking about
today, here, now?

33:45.654 --> 33:47.954
Yes. I mean, the close relatives
are already here.

33:47.956 --> 33:49.656
I could suture the seam on a gown.

33:49.658 --> 33:51.457
I guess I could get some flowers
from the gift shop.

33:51.459 --> 33:52.826
The only thing we're missing
is somebody

33:52.828 --> 33:53.793
to perform the ceremony.

33:53.795 --> 33:55.161
The chaplain, if we can find him.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.229
No one can ever find him.

33:56.231 --> 33:57.463
Well, then a notary public.

33:57.465 --> 33:58.798
A ship's captain.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.600
There's got to be somebody
around here. Check it out.

34:00.602 --> 34:02.936
I'll sew the dress.

34:02.938 --> 34:05.804
Are we wedding planners now?

34:05.806 --> 34:08.440
It's what we set out to do
today, isn't it?

34:10.710 --> 34:12.311
Thank you.

34:27.784 --> 34:29.819
We need to talk.

34:29.821 --> 34:31.020
No, we don't.

34:31.022 --> 34:32.755
Oh, don't you walk away from me.

34:32.757 --> 34:35.024
Come here, I want to
show you something.

34:36.293 --> 34:38.161
Ah, fine. What?

34:38.163 --> 34:42.031
This, my friend, is your life.

34:42.033 --> 34:44.813
And it looks like
a pretty damn good one.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.070
It's not that I don't believe you,

34:48.072 --> 34:50.239
I just, I don't have these memories.

34:50.241 --> 34:53.409
I don't have the feelings
that those people do.

34:53.411 --> 34:54.510
But doesn't it look like

34:54.512 --> 34:56.210
it might be worth trying
to get them back?

34:56.213 --> 34:57.513
Oh, hi!

34:57.515 --> 34:59.047
Oh, no, no.

34:59.049 --> 35:01.516
- Come on.
- No, come on.

35:01.518 --> 35:03.718
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:05.055 --> 35:06.121
What is all this stuff?

35:06.123 --> 35:08.991
So this is, uh, your favorite food,

35:08.993 --> 35:11.960
um, your favorite T-shirt,
got you your favorite book,

35:11.962 --> 35:14.229
um, even your favorite cocktail.

35:14.231 --> 35:15.630
Oh, actually, alcohol, that's...

35:15.632 --> 35:17.099
That's not allowed.

35:17.101 --> 35:18.700
That smells amazing, whatever that is.

35:18.702 --> 35:20.668
Yeah, well, I know you, Liam Quinn.

35:20.670 --> 35:23.005
Better than anyone else in the world.

35:23.007 --> 35:26.441
I'm sorry.
You seem really great, Elyse.

35:26.443 --> 35:28.643
But I don't know you.

35:28.645 --> 35:32.313
All the adventures we've had,
the places,

35:32.315 --> 35:34.315
I don't remember any of it.

35:34.317 --> 35:36.618
Okay, so... so let's do them
all again, then.

35:36.620 --> 35:39.287
Before your accident,
we saved money for a trip,

35:39.289 --> 35:41.656
so let's just do all
the fun stuff again.

35:41.658 --> 35:44.492
We can start where we had our
first date... at Vellichor.

35:44.494 --> 35:47.328
I could never afford
that place... Vellichor.

35:47.330 --> 35:49.096
Believe me, you can afford it now.

35:49.098 --> 35:51.966
You're a lawyer, dude,
and a pretty good one.

35:51.968 --> 35:55.769
To me, you're still
the same man I love,

35:55.771 --> 35:58.505
same man that I built this life with.

35:58.507 --> 36:00.774
Come on, Liam, please.

36:00.776 --> 36:03.877
Just give me a chance to make
you fall for me again.

36:03.879 --> 36:05.679
Just one date.

36:05.681 --> 36:08.882
Uh, how about one drink?

36:08.884 --> 36:11.718
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

36:11.720 --> 36:15.489
Well, that's not a bad idea,

36:15.491 --> 36:18.191
remembering where it all began.

36:18.193 --> 36:20.427
So, you and Jonathan...

36:20.429 --> 36:23.763
why did you want to adopt
in the first place?

36:24.866 --> 36:26.766
We were so happy.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.702
We just wanted to share it
with someone who needed us.

36:31.373 --> 36:33.173
We need to go back to the beginning.

36:33.175 --> 36:35.508
- I think we both do.
- Exactly.

36:35.510 --> 36:38.310
Why did you want to become a doctor?

36:42.350 --> 36:44.884
Yeah.

36:44.886 --> 36:47.219
You sure that I look okay?

36:47.221 --> 36:49.789
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

36:49.791 --> 36:52.124
And your dress looks stunning.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.626
I can't believe they got
this dress all fixed up.

36:57.764 --> 36:59.931
So, how many couples have you married

36:59.933 --> 37:01.400
with the power vested in you

37:01.402 --> 37:03.235
by the Interstellar Love Church?

37:03.237 --> 37:06.838
Only three, but I re-married one
of them two more times.

37:10.611 --> 37:13.612
You look so beautiful.

37:13.614 --> 37:15.046
Thanks, you guys.

37:15.048 --> 37:17.382
No, uh, you actually
kind of made our day.

37:17.384 --> 37:19.518
She's a vision in that dress.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.821
Yeah, and I didn't think anybody
could pull off a tux in here.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.394
Fellow beings...

37:29.396 --> 37:32.963
We mingle our souls in this
sacred temple of healing.

38:10.835 --> 38:12.969
Peter, it's Dana.

38:12.971 --> 38:16.873
Um, I'm flattered by your offer, truly,

38:16.875 --> 38:20.276
but I'm gonna stay where I am.

38:20.278 --> 38:23.880
Until they pry that scalpel
out of my hands.

38:23.882 --> 38:27.684
But I'm really looking forward
to our weekend at the winery.

38:27.686 --> 38:30.019
So, I'll see you Friday.

38:38.196 --> 38:39.828
Look what we did.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.097
Yep.

38:41.099 --> 38:44.333
You really did work miracles
with that dress, you know.

38:44.335 --> 38:46.302
Oh, there was one more thing.

38:46.304 --> 38:48.870
Um... you said that you were
having trouble with your vows,

38:48.872 --> 38:51.607
so I thought that, uh, that might help.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.680
Are you kidding me?

38:58.682 --> 39:00.415
I lost these the day of the accident.

39:00.417 --> 39:01.950
How did you ever get them back?

39:01.952 --> 39:05.821
Um, let's just say they found
their way back to us.

39:05.823 --> 39:07.688
Huh.

39:07.690 --> 39:08.923
What?

39:08.925 --> 39:12.260
Well, still all true.
Every single word.

39:14.531 --> 39:16.364
What do you say?

39:16.366 --> 39:18.333
What?

39:18.335 --> 39:22.737
Well, I asked our officiant,
and she has time for one more.

39:22.739 --> 39:25.339
Are you serious?

39:25.341 --> 39:27.975
As a heart attack.

39:27.977 --> 39:30.377
But we can't. We need Luke to be here.

39:30.379 --> 39:31.846
Well, then I'll call the sitter.

39:31.848 --> 39:34.181
He could be here in 10 minutes.

39:34.183 --> 39:36.050
We're really gonna do this.

39:36.052 --> 39:37.484
Should I go get everybody?

39:37.486 --> 39:39.586
No, no. Just you and I.

39:39.588 --> 39:42.189
Come on, Dr. Harris,
let's do this already.

39:56.604 --> 39:58.304
You okay?

39:58.306 --> 40:00.473
I'm not supposed to be
in the O.R. today,

40:00.475 --> 40:03.076
but we're short-staffed, so...

40:03.078 --> 40:05.444
Just a little wound up.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.815
Well, you're with me. We'll be fine.

40:18.660 --> 40:19.825
You comfortable, Jackson?

40:19.827 --> 40:21.760
Yeah, doing just fine.

40:21.762 --> 40:24.063
You're a good man, Mr. Wade.

40:24.065 --> 40:26.265
See you in recovery.

40:26.267 --> 40:28.701
Wait, hold up. Wh-where's Billy?

40:28.703 --> 40:31.670
- Billy.
- Yeah?

40:31.672 --> 40:33.672
You're feeding my snakes
tonight, right?

40:33.674 --> 40:35.373
Unfortunately, yes.

40:35.375 --> 40:38.210
Thaw the food first,
not in the microwave.

40:38.212 --> 40:40.079
Put it under some warm water.

40:40.081 --> 40:41.080
I got it.

40:41.082 --> 40:42.581
Mm.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.165
I've been looking for you, chief.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.466
We need to talk.

41:02.468 --> 41:05.737
I don't like the sound of that.

41:05.739 --> 41:07.839
I want to start a burn unit.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.573
Here at Hope Zion.

41:09.575 --> 41:11.876
Now, I'll still operate, of course,

41:11.878 --> 41:13.811
but mostly, I want to train.

41:13.813 --> 41:17.782
I want to teach those young ones
how it's done.

41:17.784 --> 41:20.884
Hospital needs this. City does.

41:20.886 --> 41:23.153
So do I.

41:23.155 --> 41:25.989
Come to my office tomorrow. We'll talk.

41:30.963 --> 41:32.596
I should have stopped him.

41:32.598 --> 41:34.531
No, you shouldn't.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.699
I've never been more proud
of this hospital.

41:36.701 --> 41:38.601
I still have a bad feeling.

41:38.603 --> 41:39.803
It's gonna be fine.

41:42.474 --> 41:43.740
Making the incision.

41:49.114 --> 41:51.781
- Whoa, what's happening, Wayne?
- His airway's closing.

41:51.783 --> 41:53.783
Anaphylaxis.

41:53.785 --> 41:55.551
Must be having an allergic
reaction to the anesthesia.

41:55.553 --> 41:58.087
Pushing epi.

41:58.089 --> 42:00.523
Dr. Bishop, he's not getting
enough oxygen.

42:02.827 --> 42:04.294
Did you talk to Jonathan?

42:04.296 --> 42:05.261
He knows.

42:05.263 --> 42:06.862
What? How?

42:06.864 --> 42:08.097
They were supposed to talk to me,

42:08.099 --> 42:09.364
- but they left him a message.
- Ugh.

42:09.366 --> 42:12.734
And he got us two tickets
to Edmonton tonight.

42:12.736 --> 42:14.036
Tonight?

42:14.038 --> 42:16.205
This is a mass casualty alert.

42:16.207 --> 42:17.973
All available staff on stand-by.

42:17.975 --> 42:20.209
Okay, we got a highway pile-up.
It's bad.

42:20.211 --> 42:21.811
Every ambulance on the way.

42:21.813 --> 42:23.145
Clear the surgical board of everything

42:23.147 --> 42:24.046
that is not life and death.

42:24.048 --> 42:25.547
Make your personal calls quick.

42:25.549 --> 42:27.683
Get fed and hydrated.

42:27.685 --> 42:28.983
Tonight could be a very long night.
