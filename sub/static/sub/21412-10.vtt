00:00.153 --> 00:03.187
♪♪

00:04.290 --> 00:06.197
Welcome to Superhero 101,

00:06.384 --> 00:07.881
where the street
is your classroom,

00:07.967 --> 00:11.920
and books are replaced with
on-the-job training.

00:17.741 --> 00:21.975
That's good, because I'm a...
hands-on kind of guy.

00:22.428 --> 00:23.740
I'm terrible at quipping.

00:23.798 --> 00:25.096
That quip would've worked better

00:25.154 --> 00:27.053
if you actually used your hands.

00:27.249 --> 00:28.967
Hands, see? Nailed it.

00:29.084 --> 00:32.991
As if one Spider-Man in this town
wasn't annoying enough!

00:33.217 --> 00:37.170
You know what they say,
two web heads are better than one.

00:37.803 --> 00:39.858
You know your
jokes are horrible, right?

00:40.561 --> 00:43.288
Have you ever
stopped a bad guy with comedy?

00:44.459 --> 00:47.022
Not yet, but there's
a first time for everything.

00:47.170 --> 00:50.501
Like you, trying out those
new web shooters you built.

00:50.647 --> 00:53.124
Great idea.
Take this, Scorpion.

00:53.182 --> 00:56.634
Okay. The shooters work great.
Your aim? Not so much.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.254
I guess I got a few things to learn.

00:58.377 --> 01:01.100
You probably did too when
you first started out, right?

01:01.256 --> 01:04.849
You mean three months ago?
Yeah, I should think so.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.327
I'm not exactly
what you call a veteran.

01:10.459 --> 01:12.889
Well, you're a great teacher.
And besides,

01:12.991 --> 01:15.834
I need a mentor who can
spin webs and stick to walls.

01:16.030 --> 01:20.564
So, that kind of narrows my options
down to you. I'm... flattered?

01:20.631 --> 01:24.163
Do you two ever stop talking?

01:24.944 --> 01:28.803
Copy that. Moving into
second position now.

01:29.202 --> 01:34.131
- Hey, where does he think he's going?
- Something's not right here.

01:37.928 --> 01:41.077
You getting your spider
tingle, jangle thing?

01:41.194 --> 01:45.398
It's called "Spider-Sense."
And no, it's just more of a gut thing.

01:46.727 --> 01:50.227
Ugh. Spider gut?
Thankfully, I didn't get that power.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.500
What I mean is, Scorpion's more of

01:54.586 --> 01:57.434
a "gloat about his evil plans"
type of bad guy,

01:57.570 --> 02:00.367
and he hasn't mentioned
what he's up to.

02:03.812 --> 02:07.253
We were in the middle of a
conversation, and you ran off. So rude.

02:07.311 --> 02:10.352
Joke all you want.
My job is done here.

02:10.578 --> 02:13.753
<i>Over the years, I've
roamed the jungles of the world,</i>

02:13.836 --> 02:17.320
<i>stalking the most
dangerous creatures alive.</i>

02:17.617 --> 02:19.555
- Huh?
- Oh, man!

02:19.633 --> 02:22.969
"Kraven's Amazing Hunt" is on.
It's my favorite show.

02:23.289 --> 02:26.617
<i>But today I've come
to the asphalt jungle</i>

02:26.742 --> 02:29.305
<i>to hunt something different.</i>

02:30.336 --> 02:33.234
Hey! That's us!
We're on TV!

02:33.336 --> 02:36.500
<i>The most dangerous prey of all,</i>

02:36.633 --> 02:41.297
<i>the menace known as Spider-Man.</i>

02:41.492 --> 02:44.242
<i>You might wanna pick
a new favorite show.</i>

02:50.318 --> 02:54.141
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01 Episode 10</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>" Kraven's Amazing Hunt"</font>

02:56.172 --> 02:59.750
Any last words, Spider-Man?

02:59.891 --> 03:03.320
- Uh...
- Eh? Two spider-men?

03:03.461 --> 03:06.325
Thanks a lot.
What? I'm not Spider-Man.

03:06.392 --> 03:07.859
I'm a totally different guy.

03:07.977 --> 03:10.664
Besides, these reality shows
are all fake anyway.

03:11.230 --> 03:12.798
Move!

03:14.844 --> 03:18.250
Fake, huh? You really gotta work
on that Spider-Sense of yours.

03:19.664 --> 03:22.665
I told you not to call me
when we're live.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.945
Do you want both of them?

03:25.975 --> 03:29.641
- My pleasure.
- Tranquilizer darts?

03:29.883 --> 03:33.080
So maybe he's not trying
to kill us on live television.

03:33.554 --> 03:36.117
He takes his prey home
and does it there.

03:36.266 --> 03:39.203
But it's all just a show
for the cameras, right?

03:39.437 --> 03:42.039
Something tells me this guy's
more about the reality

03:42.329 --> 03:43.662
and less about the show.

03:43.773 --> 03:45.227
Gwen, look!

03:45.405 --> 03:48.031
Spidey's on Kraven's Amazing Hunt.

03:49.890 --> 03:53.962
- So is Miles!
- What about Miles?

03:54.241 --> 03:58.009
Uh, I was just saying, this...
is Miles' favorite show.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.719
Really?

03:59.934 --> 04:02.703
I don't know if I approve
of these types of shows.

04:02.781 --> 04:04.881
I think they just dull your senses.

04:05.183 --> 04:08.937
Scorpion must've been a setup.
He was just bait.

04:09.104 --> 04:11.578
Yep. And we took it hook, line,
and stinger.

04:11.695 --> 04:12.930
We're still live on TV.

04:13.008 --> 04:15.137
<i>Then we better get out of here
and come up with a plan</i>

04:15.195 --> 04:18.007
<i>to deal Mr. Reality a reality check.</i>

04:18.860 --> 04:20.945
<i>Do not fear, good viewers.</i>

04:21.003 --> 04:25.040
<i>Kraven the Hunter
always gets his target.</i>

04:25.930 --> 04:29.007
<i>I can leap with the agility of a jaguar,</i>

04:29.187 --> 04:32.629
<i>swing with the ease of
an orangutan...</i>

04:36.137 --> 04:39.512
<i>and strategize with the
cleverness of a human.</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:42.371
<i>To which terrain
did the prey escape?</i>

04:42.775 --> 04:45.004
<i>Uh, huh?</i>

04:45.254 --> 04:46.893
<i>Which way did they go?</i>

04:46.988 --> 04:51.408
<i>- Oh, uh, they went that way.
- Much thanks.</i>

04:54.222 --> 04:55.802
Let's head down 5th Avenue.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.127
I find the wind current there
increases my swing speed.

05:00.246 --> 05:01.901
Uh-oh. I forgot.

05:01.959 --> 05:06.573
Kraven studies his prey's patterns and
then sets traps based on their behavior.

05:07.456 --> 05:10.401
He totally knows everything
we're gonna do!

05:11.470 --> 05:14.041
Wait! What?

05:17.817 --> 05:20.620
You're saying he's booby-trapped
all of New York City?

05:20.726 --> 05:22.696
Yeah...
Pretty cool, right?

05:22.791 --> 05:26.598
Are you not the least bit concerned
that someone is hunting us?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.588
Sure.
But he has to catch us first.

05:30.978 --> 05:34.281
Only a matter of time,
young spider.

05:34.955 --> 05:38.268
<i>Preferably 22 minutes,
not counting commercials.</i>

05:39.557 --> 05:40.776
One thing's for sure:

05:40.834 --> 05:44.169
I am never wearing my Kraven
Fan Club shirt ever again!

05:47.366 --> 05:49.971
Worth every penny.

05:50.341 --> 05:52.627
- Adrian.
- What is it?

05:54.509 --> 05:57.900
My latest plan
to capture the spider-men.

05:57.967 --> 06:02.081
Since my Slayer wasn't able to retrieve
either of these spider specimens,

06:02.192 --> 06:05.364
I figured why not hire
the world's greatest hunter.

06:05.588 --> 06:09.002
Only instead of taking them
back to his museum for mounting,

06:09.143 --> 06:11.744
he'll deliver them to me
for experimentation.

06:11.977 --> 06:14.268
And he agreed to this willingly?

06:14.414 --> 06:17.737
Kraven may be a hunter,
but he's also a businessman,

06:17.928 --> 06:21.396
and businessmen are always
looking for financial backing.

06:21.721 --> 06:24.623
Something I was
happy to contribute to.

06:28.604 --> 06:31.932
<i>Look at them,
the urban spider-humans</i>

06:31.990 --> 06:34.362
<i>in their natural environment.</i>

06:34.965 --> 06:36.733
<i>Amazing creatures.</i>

06:37.213 --> 06:39.112
<i>But do not worry, loyal viewers.</i>

06:39.210 --> 06:42.413
<i>My sonic blasts have taken down rhinos.</i>

06:42.481 --> 06:47.174
<i>I don't think a couple of
little spiders will be a problem.</i>

06:47.963 --> 06:51.095
Well, the good news is, 
this is some good hero practice for you.

06:51.153 --> 06:53.377
Only you could find 
the bright side of this.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.034
Huh?

06:56.969 --> 07:00.798
I feel my Spider-Sense, but can't
tell what direction it's coming from.

07:02.049 --> 07:03.323
Watch out!

07:06.157 --> 07:07.276
Miles!

07:07.443 --> 07:11.534
<i>Go on. Save your sidekick,
Spider-Man.</i>

07:11.592 --> 07:15.548
<i>I've already witnessed
your analytical mind in action.</i>

07:15.745 --> 07:20.096
<i>Show me how compassionate
you are to the cluster.</i>

07:20.280 --> 07:22.612
<i>A "cluster" is a group of spiders.</i>

07:22.670 --> 07:26.315
<i>Something you learn when
you're... cravin' knowledge.</i>

07:26.418 --> 07:29.268
<i>Brought to you by the good
people at Public Media.</i>

07:30.612 --> 07:32.471
Did he just call me a sidekick?

07:32.529 --> 07:36.385
Hey, you say that again, and I'll
blast that mustache into sideburns!

07:36.502 --> 07:37.996
I don't know if this'll work,

07:38.054 --> 07:41.198
but time to try an
electro-blast on this thing.

07:43.091 --> 07:45.386
Way to go! Miles?

07:50.940 --> 07:52.909
- That was amazing!
- I know.

07:52.967 --> 07:55.018
I thought a group of spiders
was called a "clutter."

07:55.190 --> 07:57.984
No. I mean,
what you did was amazing.

07:58.051 --> 08:01.553
Plus you might've just figured
a way to beat Kraven.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.760
I did?

08:02.863 --> 08:06.135
Yes. He's studied my patterns,
but you're so new

08:06.245 --> 08:09.327
to this whole superhero thing,
you don't even have patterns yet.

08:09.394 --> 08:12.330
So me being inexperienced
is a good thing?

08:12.573 --> 08:14.166
Right now it is.

08:14.338 --> 08:17.906
So we both need to be unpredictable
if we're going to beat Kraven.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.924
- Where's someplace we never go?
- A comedy club.

08:21.731 --> 08:27.003
- I was thinking the sewer.
- The sewer? Ugh!

08:27.180 --> 08:29.643
Unless that's the name
of the comedy club.

08:33.698 --> 08:35.099
Follow me!

08:39.206 --> 08:42.370
Nope. Nothing
funny about being down here.

08:42.962 --> 08:45.581
There's no way Kraven
set any traps below ground,

08:45.639 --> 08:48.533
- because I never use the sewers.
- Brilliant.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.291
- Unless...
- Unless what?

08:51.411 --> 08:53.799
On the show,
Kraven also tries to predict

08:53.909 --> 08:56.344
what backup plan
his target might use.

08:56.987 --> 08:59.644
Like, say... going underground?

08:59.831 --> 09:02.687
Whoa!
Spidey-Senses kicked in!

09:02.754 --> 09:07.213
- But it's coming from all directions.
- 'Cause the danger is too!

09:11.807 --> 09:13.916
<i>The hunt is over!</i>

09:13.986 --> 09:16.159
<i>I have won.</i>

09:16.463 --> 09:19.049
<i>But we expected that, didn't we?</i>

09:26.500 --> 09:29.377
<i>No use in
struggling, young spider.</i>

09:29.549 --> 09:33.260
<i>That cage is made from
electrified titanium alloy...</i>

09:33.318 --> 09:36.291
<i>three times stronger than steel.</i>

09:36.570 --> 09:41.331
<i>And made by Cages, Incorporated.
Available at select hunting outlets.</i>

09:43.666 --> 09:47.659
<i>And now, the branding iron.</i>

09:48.049 --> 09:50.263
<i>Uh-oh.
The branding ceremony.</i>

09:50.330 --> 09:53.721
<i>It's the ultimate humiliation
before being shipped to his museum.</i>

09:53.779 --> 09:56.229
<i>Your knowledge of this show
is getting annoying. Sorry.</i>

09:56.334 --> 09:59.745
<i>I have defeated many jungle animals,</i>

09:59.834 --> 10:04.303
<i>but today I am victor
over a new breed of creature...</i>

10:04.565 --> 10:06.659
<i>the human spider.</i>

10:06.799 --> 10:11.807
<i>Let all who look upon them see
that they were brought down by Kraven!</i>

10:11.877 --> 10:14.831
<i>Hero lesson! If your supervillain
turns his back to blab,</i>

10:14.920 --> 10:17.151
<i>disengage his cage.</i>

10:19.789 --> 10:22.426
<i>Nobody escapes Kraven!</i>

10:27.017 --> 10:30.317
<i>- Oh, nice shot!
- I'm a quick study.</i>

10:30.450 --> 10:33.395
<i>Then here's a lesson
in web crafting.</i>

10:36.239 --> 10:38.598
<i>With a little
branding of our own.</i>

10:40.309 --> 10:42.419
<i>Aw, what's the matter,
Kravey buddy?</i>

10:42.477 --> 10:46.450
<i>- This episode not sticking to the script?
- Ciao.</i>

10:46.950 --> 10:50.864
<i>Turn those cameras off! Now!</i>

10:50.988 --> 10:54.015
What is that idiot doing?
This was not part of our deal.

10:55.286 --> 10:57.254
I think The Kraven Show
just got canceled.

10:57.312 --> 11:00.915
That's okay. "Cooking with Carol"
is my second favorite show.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.066
Uh-oh.

11:05.293 --> 11:10.168
You expect to humiliate me
and get away with it?!

11:10.317 --> 11:14.520
For centuries, my family has
been the deadliest of hunters.

11:14.700 --> 11:19.348
<i>But now my rage extends far beyond that,</i>

11:19.452 --> 11:23.739
<i>and so you will suffer
a slow and painful destruction</i>

11:23.851 --> 11:28.722
<i>unsuitable for...
television!</i>

11:30.123 --> 11:32.758
Whoa! I've never
seen these darts before,

11:32.840 --> 11:35.709
and I've watched all the DVD
bonus materials.

11:36.526 --> 11:38.393
These are heat-seeking darts.

11:42.504 --> 11:43.715
Phew!

11:44.184 --> 11:47.911
Thank goodness for truth in advertising.
Head for a heat source!

11:49.905 --> 11:53.593
"Ice cream,
cold cuts, freezing"...

11:53.651 --> 11:55.132
Oh, come on!

11:55.783 --> 11:56.999
Aah!

11:58.226 --> 11:59.357
No!

12:01.921 --> 12:05.827
Snug as a bug
in a Moroccan wool rug.

12:05.952 --> 12:10.359
But let us make it
even more tighter, shall we?

12:10.507 --> 12:14.241
That was a venomous fear dart
that hit your friend,

12:14.339 --> 12:16.999
extracted from the African cobra.

12:17.648 --> 12:21.333
It will not only
frighten him but, if not treated,

12:21.780 --> 12:24.146
scare him to death.

12:24.382 --> 12:26.616
<i>The more you
struggle, young spider,</i>

12:26.690 --> 12:30.734
<i>the faster the venom
seeps into your bloodstream.</i>

12:30.870 --> 12:32.851
No! Get away!

12:33.089 --> 12:36.855
- Get away!
- Huh? Where did he go?

12:36.913 --> 12:38.249
Where did he go?

12:38.364 --> 12:41.249
Not gonna find out
stuck behind a boomerang.

12:46.007 --> 12:47.749
Miles! Where are you?

12:48.264 --> 12:49.937
He couldn't just disappear like that.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.443
Maybe thermal vision will help.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.077
There!

12:57.493 --> 13:00.961
He must have some sort of camouflage
power we didn't know about.

13:01.905 --> 13:03.640
I gotcha.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.268
Miles, calm down.

13:11.464 --> 13:12.882
<i>Calm down.</i>

13:12.940 --> 13:16.341
You're a spider.
Terrifying... spider...

13:16.679 --> 13:19.504
<i>No, I'm not a spider, Miles.</i>

13:19.609 --> 13:23.523
I'm... I'm your friend.
I'm Peter.

13:27.218 --> 13:29.218
Pe-Peter?

13:30.952 --> 13:37.351
- Is... Is that really you?
- Yeah. It's me, Miles.

13:37.524 --> 13:39.773
- I'm Spider-Man.
- No...

13:39.921 --> 13:42.280
It can't be.
I'm freaking out!

13:42.405 --> 13:44.964
I know. It's a lot.
And that venom isn't helping.

13:45.022 --> 13:48.952
But just try to calm down so it doesn't
spread through your bloodstream so fast.

13:49.179 --> 13:51.796
Okay. Deep breaths.
Calming down.

13:51.854 --> 13:54.538
Wow. It made me see things, Peter.

13:54.749 --> 13:57.296
Yes. But you know what else it did?

13:57.726 --> 14:00.327
It unleashed a power
you didn't even know you had.

14:00.557 --> 14:02.593
Cloaking? I mean, come on.

14:02.715 --> 14:05.284
First the electric sting,
now invisibility?

14:05.413 --> 14:07.741
Man, I wish I was bitten by your spider.

14:07.991 --> 14:09.648
What are we gonna do about Kraven?

14:09.851 --> 14:11.827
We are not going to do anything.

14:11.954 --> 14:14.890
You are getting dropped off at
a hospital while I go after him.

14:15.070 --> 14:16.593
I have to go with you.

14:16.763 --> 14:19.195
He's not going to quit
until he destroys you.

14:19.388 --> 14:21.515
He could be anywhere.

14:25.827 --> 14:28.695
Or I'm guessing
he's at the Central Park Zoo!

14:32.273 --> 14:35.280
- Then let's go!
- Miles, you have to rest.

14:35.421 --> 14:38.804
Part of being a hero is knowing
when to fight and when to heal.

14:39.007 --> 14:41.319
There will be times when
you get to work as a team,

14:41.386 --> 14:45.257
but there are other times...
when you have to finish on your own.

14:46.793 --> 14:49.827
Sorry! Lunchtime's over!

14:51.999 --> 14:54.739
What's that?
I don't speak lion.

14:56.843 --> 14:58.438
Uh, you're welcome.

14:58.524 --> 15:02.570
I don't know what
I like better, Spider-Man...

15:02.734 --> 15:04.585
that you took the bait,

15:04.873 --> 15:07.718
or that you have become the bait.

15:07.811 --> 15:10.835
Feeding time, my kitties!

15:10.984 --> 15:13.538
You couldn't have made
an army of penguins, huh?

15:14.683 --> 15:17.898
- Attack!
- Here, have a seat.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.609
This is seriously the worst
petting zoo of all time!

15:27.811 --> 15:29.611
This is for your own good!

15:29.669 --> 15:32.077
Trust me. I'm not lyin'.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.945
Get it?
"Lyin'"?

15:34.116 --> 15:35.320
Ah, you don't care.

15:35.432 --> 15:37.934
Good kitty. Nice kitty.
Uh-oh.

15:38.351 --> 15:40.070
Well, I always wanted to be

15:40.128 --> 15:42.632
an amateur lion tamer.
Yah!

15:45.532 --> 15:49.320
Wait. Don't all cats love
balls of yarn? Or webs?

15:49.765 --> 15:52.148
I hope.
What are you growling at me for?

15:52.237 --> 15:53.952
I'm an animal lover.

15:59.312 --> 16:01.772
Kraven's the hunter.
Why don't you growl at him?

16:01.866 --> 16:06.445
Because they recognize
the true king of the jungle.

16:06.874 --> 16:09.468
Well, that's where
spiders and lions differ.

16:09.733 --> 16:12.226
Actually, there are a lot of differences.
But you get my point.

16:12.284 --> 16:14.484
As will you.

16:20.882 --> 16:23.476
Norman Osborn?
You saved me?

16:23.687 --> 16:26.945
"Saved" isn't exactly the word I'd use.

16:33.415 --> 16:35.782
That was... shocking.

16:42.890 --> 16:45.951
Struggle all you want,
my spider friend.

16:46.429 --> 16:48.226
Those electromagnetic restraints

16:48.284 --> 16:53.843
can hold both man and beast.
We had a deal, Kraven.

16:54.185 --> 16:56.640
I bankroll your little TV broadcast

16:56.698 --> 16:58.609
in exchange for the spider-men.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.198
But you veered from the plan.

17:01.382 --> 17:04.476
<i>And nobody disobeys
Norman Osborn.</i>

17:04.788 --> 17:09.936
My honor is more important
than your money, Osborn.

17:10.118 --> 17:14.765
- And that spider disgraced me!
- Well, lucky for you,

17:14.830 --> 17:18.017
Spider-Man is not going to
enjoy the next few moments.

17:20.393 --> 17:22.835
It didn't have to be
like this, Spider-Man.

17:23.066 --> 17:26.608
I asked you to be my friend,
but you refused.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.843
So now I have to do things
the hard way.

17:31.553 --> 17:34.640
You are quite an interesting specimen.

17:35.070 --> 17:39.062
At first, I thought you were
an anomaly. A freak, in fact.

17:39.381 --> 17:44.343
But then came a second spider-man,
and my concerns were confirmed.

17:44.650 --> 17:47.023
A spider army is on its way, isn't it?

17:47.213 --> 17:48.779
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:48.846 --> 17:50.780
Oh, sure, you don't.

17:51.050 --> 17:53.734
But fortunately, I don't
need you to understand.

17:54.484 --> 17:59.718
- I just need you to be dissected.
- Don't! Don't do it!

17:59.978 --> 18:04.093
- I'm a... afraid!
- Huh?

18:04.414 --> 18:05.643
What?

18:05.701 --> 18:08.866
You don't understand
what happens when I'm afraid.

18:09.011 --> 18:11.866
Sometimes I just want to disappear,

18:12.100 --> 18:17.338
- where no one can see me!
- Oh, I get it, I get it.

18:17.757 --> 18:20.945
Ugh! Your cowardice disgusts me.

18:21.195 --> 18:23.632
I'm surprised, Spider-Man.

18:23.793 --> 18:27.484
If your blood runs yellow,
maybe I don't want it after all.

18:28.085 --> 18:31.382
Mmm, actually, I do.

18:38.189 --> 18:40.851
<i>Oh, yeah!
Practice makes awesome.</i>

18:42.482 --> 18:45.518
Whoever you are, be careful.

18:45.726 --> 18:48.460
Don't make the same mistake
Spider-Man did.

18:48.655 --> 18:51.687
Join me, and I promise you
won't regret it.

18:53.015 --> 18:54.226
<i>No, thanks.</i>

18:54.284 --> 18:55.713
Ah? Ah?

19:03.093 --> 19:04.477
<i>Those are quite the moves.</i>

19:04.630 --> 19:07.288
<i>I can't tell if you're a vulture
or a funky chicken.</i>

19:08.952 --> 19:12.523
How about you jolt first
and joke second?

19:12.740 --> 19:14.639
Patience, Teach.

19:17.999 --> 19:20.093
I just wanted to show you
what I could do on my own.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.007
I'm incredibly proud.

19:22.998 --> 19:24.585
And just a wee bit jealous.

19:26.859 --> 19:30.843
You fool! You've ruptured
the hydromatic condenser!

19:33.702 --> 19:36.654
Get me out of here
before this place blows apart.

19:38.913 --> 19:41.835
- I think we should follow their lead.
- Hold on.

19:44.343 --> 19:46.830
What are you doing?
He tried to kill us, remember?

19:47.085 --> 19:48.898
Another hero rule to learn:

19:49.040 --> 19:51.133
just because the bad guys
try to wipe us out

19:51.228 --> 19:53.267
doesn't mean we do the same.

19:55.767 --> 20:01.196
Leave me to perish!
I have failed and deserve to die.

20:01.352 --> 20:04.396
Get over it, Kraven.
You've spent so much time with animals

20:04.456 --> 20:06.673
you've forgotten
that part of being human

20:06.750 --> 20:08.753
is picking yourself up when you fail.

20:08.955 --> 20:12.389
That's reality. Too bad your
viewers can't see you do that.

20:12.456 --> 20:16.556
And for the record, I'm
deleting your show from my DVR.

20:18.407 --> 20:20.001
We should get out of here.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.165
- Where'd he go?
- There!

20:24.727 --> 20:27.884
- Should we follow him?
- No. Nobody was hurt this time.

20:27.997 --> 20:30.829
But if he crosses the line again,
we know where to find him.

20:30.899 --> 20:34.579
Yeah. Thursday nights
on the Mustache Channel.

20:39.285 --> 20:42.743
So, that was a pretty terrifying
training session, huh?

20:42.931 --> 20:44.267
Are you kidding me?

20:44.490 --> 20:46.681
I wasn't scared.
It was just an act.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.335
Really?
So that camouflage

20:49.395 --> 20:51.902
just randomly kicked in
on its own, huh?

20:51.987 --> 20:53.784
- You know it.
- Oh, no!

20:53.880 --> 20:55.878
- Kraven's back!
- Aah!

20:57.096 --> 20:58.628
I thought so.

20:59.542 --> 21:02.272
Okay. I guess it was
a little scary.

21:02.620 --> 21:03.988
Which goes to show you,

21:04.152 --> 21:06.777
sometimes even your fear
can be a strength.

21:07.152 --> 21:09.300
I guess you're right.
And, hey, listen.

21:09.358 --> 21:12.893
I wanna thank you for showing
me the ropes and the webs.

21:13.013 --> 21:16.385
You're a good teacher
and a great friend.

21:16.584 --> 21:18.534
Thanks for trusting me
with your secret.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.738
Thanks for trusting me with yours.

21:20.869 --> 21:24.806
Although remember, at school,
nobody can know I'm Spider-Man.

21:25.464 --> 21:29.234
As far as you know, Peter Parker
is just the incredibly handsome,

21:29.301 --> 21:32.339
- brilliant kid down the hall.
- So, you want me to lie.
