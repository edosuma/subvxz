WEBVTT

00:02.369 --> 00:04.436
- Shoes off,

00:04.438 --> 00:06.205
Heels against
the wall,

00:06.207 --> 00:08.007
Feet together,
head level.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.174
Go ahead.

00:09.176 --> 00:13.245
- Okay, and 5'11 3/4".

00:13.247 --> 00:14.246
- No, no, no.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.247
I'm 6 feet tall.

00:17.484 --> 00:18.484
- Me next.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.718
- No, wait, wait, ally.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.053
Let daddy do it.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.756
Go ahead, do it again.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.157
- Okay.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.658
5'11 3/4".

00:26.660 --> 00:28.694
- No!

00:28.696 --> 00:32.664
- It says 5'11 3/4".

00:32.666 --> 00:34.266
- You can't tell
on a giraffe.

00:37.670 --> 00:42.441
I'm 6 feet tall,
everybody.

00:42.443 --> 00:46.245
I'm 6 feet tall.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.312
Ray barone.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.414
Black hair, brown eyes,

00:48.416 --> 00:49.748
6 feet tall.

00:49.750 --> 00:50.816
People say,
"who are you?"

00:50.818 --> 00:55.320
I'm 6 feet tall,
that's who I am.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.388
- All right.
And...

00:56.390 --> 00:59.758
It's 5'11 3/4".

00:59.760 --> 01:01.560
- Come on!
- That's what it says.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.795
Look, 5'11 3/4".

01:02.797 --> 01:03.796
- All right,
all right.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.832
What, you like
saying it?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.801
- You don't have to get
so upset about it.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.702
- Guys care about height,
you know?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.604
Just like women
care about weight.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.606
- I don't care about weight.

01:14.608 --> 01:15.808
- Yeah, you don't

01:15.810 --> 01:17.843
'cause you only weigh
about, what, 140?

01:24.684 --> 01:25.784
See?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.086
Don't get on your high horse

01:27.088 --> 01:28.720
If you can't take the smell.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.859
- Ray, I'm sorry
about your height.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.428
I still love you, okay?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.496
The kids love you.

01:37.498 --> 01:41.233
Don't you, kids?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.468
See?

01:42.470 --> 01:43.769
- I'm 6 feet tall.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.437
- Honey, maybe you
were 6 feet tall,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.706
But you just shrunk
a little bit.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.707
- What do you mean, shrunk?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.109
- Well, that happens, you know?

01:50.111 --> 01:52.244
As you get older,
people tend to just--

01:52.246 --> 01:54.246
- Shrink?

01:54.248 --> 01:55.848
- Look, it's not a big deal.
It happens to everyone.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.416
- I'm shrinking now?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.717
- Ray, don't get all, you know--

01:58.719 --> 02:00.252
- Oh, my god. I'm shrinking.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.253
- Ray.

02:01.255 --> 02:01.854
Ray!

02:05.558 --> 02:07.759
Mommy is not 140.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.804
- Raymond, raymond, raymond.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.173
Sounds like you're having
a little midlife crisis.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.708
- What?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.476
No, no.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.211
God, midlife crisis.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.180
I don't want one of those.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.415
- Ah, that's not the problem.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.216
Come here, raygeleh.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.753
You're worried
that you're not gonna accomplish

02:34.755 --> 02:37.156
Everything
you set out to do in life.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.457
- I am?
- Who knows?

02:38.459 --> 02:40.692
But I went to this
self-improvement seminar

02:40.694 --> 02:42.161
To meet women,

02:42.163 --> 02:43.662
And I learned that
people with goals

02:43.664 --> 02:46.165
Don't worry so much
about getting old.

02:46.167 --> 02:46.932
- Did you meet anyone?

02:46.934 --> 02:49.434
- No one.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.571
Apparently, I don't
appeal to women with goals.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.571
- Hey, guys,

02:53.573 --> 02:54.740
Why don't you go home,
hug your fathers,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.808
And maybe
we'll win a game.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.310
- You know what you
got to do, ray?

02:58.312 --> 02:59.711
What they made us do
at the seminar.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.246
You make a list
of the 100 things

03:01.248 --> 03:02.714
You want to do before you die.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.715
- 100?

03:03.717 --> 03:04.716
[muttering]

03:04.718 --> 03:07.886
- Easy.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.588
Yeah, you just, you know,
think of the stuff

03:09.590 --> 03:11.390
That you want in your life
that you don't have.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.692
- Look, I don't need
any of that, all right?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.461
All I need is
another quarter inch.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.698
- Who doesn't?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.733
- You are correct.

03:21.735 --> 03:22.734
Right on the money.

03:24.804 --> 03:28.707
- "things to do
before I die"?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.776
- It's personal, okay?

03:30.778 --> 03:32.844
Like you have your
feminine products.

03:37.450 --> 03:41.386
- Is this about you shrinking?

03:41.388 --> 03:43.855
- Maybe a little.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.692
Look, the guys thought

03:46.694 --> 03:48.727
That the reason the shrinking
thing is bothering me

03:48.729 --> 03:51.797
Is 'cause I'm having
a midlife crisis.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.399
Yeah, and I need
some goals, you know?

03:54.401 --> 03:55.400
Something to shoot for.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.807
- You want to have
an affair?

04:03.743 --> 04:05.310
- What?
Where did that come from?

04:05.312 --> 04:07.846
- Well, how come
you won't show me?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.615
- Yeah, I put "have an affair"
on paper.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.690
That's one of my goals.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.925
"disappoint another woman."

04:24.897 --> 04:26.865
- Huh.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.669
Yeah, I get it.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.504
Okay, just give me
the list, all right?

04:32.506 --> 04:34.306
I just want to see it.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.676
- Look, just keep in mind,
it's not really done yet.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.444
- "peking duck."

04:39.446 --> 04:40.646
"goat cheese pizza"?

04:40.648 --> 04:42.447
What is this?

04:42.449 --> 04:43.448
- That's--I told you.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.417
It's goals and stuff.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.418
- These are your goals?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.588
These are restaurant specials.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.989
- I've never had
the peking duck.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.695
- So your goal
is just to eat things

04:56.697 --> 05:00.432
You've never eaten before.

05:00.434 --> 05:04.336
- Not entirely.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.772
- "enlarged prostate."

05:09.342 --> 05:10.676
- See?

05:10.678 --> 05:14.046
That's something
that I want to avoid,

05:14.048 --> 05:17.049
Not something I wish to eat.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.725
- I see.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.826
- What?
What are you--

05:27.828 --> 05:29.594
- Well, ray, come on,
you're a writer.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.029
Don't you want to
do something like,

05:31.031 --> 05:34.366
I don't know, write
the great american novel or...

05:34.368 --> 05:35.534
- I thought about that,

05:35.536 --> 05:37.336
And then I thought,

05:37.338 --> 05:40.372
I don't even want to read
the great american novel.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.973
- Well, I mean, there's got to
be something else

05:41.975 --> 05:44.376
You want to do besides...

05:44.378 --> 05:46.745
"never throw up again."

05:55.355 --> 05:56.555
- No.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.556
That's it, see?

05:57.558 --> 05:58.557
That's it.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.558
I got nothing.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.759
I got no dreams.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.761
- Oh, ray, everybody
has dreams.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.762
- Yeah, what do you have?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.664
What's on your list?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.099
- Me?
- Yeah.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.034
- [scoffs]

06:09.036 --> 06:10.669
Well, I just thought
that, you know,

06:10.671 --> 06:11.770
After the kids grow up,

06:11.772 --> 06:13.839
It might be nice if,
I don't know,

06:13.841 --> 06:15.507
We moved upstate

06:15.509 --> 06:18.143
And opened a little
bed-and-breakfast somewhere.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.046
Bed-and-breakfast?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.046
What do you mean,
like strangers

06:22.048 --> 06:24.750
Coming in and out
of our house all the time?

06:24.752 --> 06:26.818
- Yes, ray, strangers.

06:26.820 --> 06:31.390
I'd like to try
strangers for a change.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.858
- I don't know.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.726
This is all
happening too fast.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.162
- We don't have
to do it today, ray.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.030
I'm just trying
to get you thinking.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.767
- Yeah, I'm thinking I'd better
come up with something

06:41.769 --> 06:45.670
Before I end up with
your bed-and-breakfast,

06:45.672 --> 06:47.506
Tucking in a gay couple
from cleveland.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.043
- All right, all right.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.482
You know what?

06:57.484 --> 06:58.884
Maybe the reason that you can't

06:58.886 --> 07:01.453
Come up with any goals
for yourself

07:01.455 --> 07:06.191
Is that, in your own ray way,

07:06.193 --> 07:08.026
You're actually content.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.431
- Where are you
picking up that vibe?

07:12.433 --> 07:13.431
- Look at the facts.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.601
You have a great job,
a wonderful family,

07:16.603 --> 07:20.071
A loving wife
who weighs nowhere near 140--

07:21.474 --> 07:22.974
- Yeah, so what
are you saying?

07:22.976 --> 07:25.877
So, I think maybe
you've already accomplished

07:25.879 --> 07:28.847
More than you've
ever dreamed of.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.848
- You really think so?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.116
- I do.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.951
Maybe you're
one of the lucky people

07:32.953 --> 07:34.719
Who's actually
living his dream.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.054
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.055
- Wow.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.590
- Yeah, see?

07:38.592 --> 07:39.191
You feel better?

07:39.193 --> 07:42.627
- Yeah.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.662
- What?

07:43.664 --> 07:44.863
What, ray?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.465
- I'm just--I'm thinking.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.066
If what you said is true,

07:48.068 --> 07:50.202
And I've already
done everything,

07:50.204 --> 07:54.473
Then I guess

07:54.475 --> 07:55.807
This is all there is.

08:23.669 --> 08:24.903
- Hey.

08:24.905 --> 08:25.937
Ah, good morning,
raymond.

08:25.939 --> 08:26.972
Want some eggs?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.540
- No. No, thanks.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.941
Listen, I want to ask
you guys something.

08:29.943 --> 08:30.941
When I was a kid,

08:30.943 --> 08:32.577
Do you remember me
having a dream?

08:32.579 --> 08:34.546
- I remember you
wetting the bed.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.215
- No, no, I don't mean that.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.885
I mean, like,
what did I want to be?

08:39.887 --> 08:40.552
- Dry.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.658
- Morning.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.859
- How many eggs, robbie?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.060
- Uh, three,

08:49.062 --> 08:50.929
And today I'd like them raw,
in a glass.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.097
- What?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.632
- I'm in training.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.867
Gonna be running
the new york marathon this year.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.202
- Come on, you really
gonna do that?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.637
- That's right.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.605
- Marathon, huh?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.073
- Put me down for
a buck a mile.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.212
- You don't pledge
for this one, dad.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.013
- I'm not pledging.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.582
I'm betting.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.884
I say you're crying
like a little girl by mile two.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.656
Hey, ray, you want
some of this action?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.591
- Hey, look. At least
he's got a dream, right?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.259
- Are you making fun, too?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.662
- No, I'm actually jealous.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.896
You have a dream.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.164
I got nothing.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.100
- Nothing.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.603
You got nothing.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.604
- What?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.339
- House.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.041
Wife.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.009
Little daughter.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.345
Twin boys.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.714
That's nothing to you?

09:42.716 --> 09:45.584
That was my dream!

09:45.586 --> 09:48.053
Hello!

09:48.055 --> 09:50.322
So why don't you just
go take your little midlife

09:50.324 --> 09:52.190
"I'm shrinking,
I'm dying,

09:52.192 --> 09:53.992
I don't have any dreams,"

09:53.994 --> 09:56.227
And go right back
across the street to paradise.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.131
- Look,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.299
You don't understand.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.101
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
I don't understand.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.303
Just go, okay, because I'm gonna
tell you something.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.304
I have--

10:17.850 --> 10:18.850
Ow.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.687
- Are you all right,
robbie?

10:22.689 --> 10:23.722
- Yeah, fine, ma.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.090
I'm fine.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.725
Raymond.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.726
- What?
What do you--

10:29.195 --> 10:30.829
- Okay,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.163
Ow, ow, ow.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.034
Guess I'm just gonna have to

10:36.036 --> 10:38.670
Scratch dream number two
off my list.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.847
Go ahead and cook
those eggs, ma.

10:52.251 --> 10:55.754
- I should've put my money
on warm-up.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.088
- Raymond, why didn't you
tell us

10:57.090 --> 10:59.157
You were having
a midlife crisis?

10:59.159 --> 11:02.293
- The announcements
are still being printed, ma.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.762
- Here, sit down.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.931
Have some eggs.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.434
- You know what I always
wanted to do, ray?

11:09.436 --> 11:12.203
Sing like tony bennett.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.304
- Tony bennett?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.874
- That's right.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.409
But look at me.

11:17.411 --> 11:22.013
Am I tony bennett?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.315
- No.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.819
- You see, you do a thing,
and that's what you are.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.754
One guy lives in brooklyn.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.224
One guy lives in sutton place.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.359
Another guy's a lawyer.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.227
One guy's a doctor.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.262
Another guy dies.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.396
Another guy gets well.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.931
People are born--

11:39.933 --> 11:43.301
- What the hell
are you talking about?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.904
- Don't worry so much.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.473
You die,
you did what you did.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.442
- Frank, stop saying "die."

11:50.444 --> 11:53.244
It's obvious
raymond's afraid of dying.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.746
- Well, what am I
supposed to tell him,

11:54.748 --> 11:56.114
That it's not gonna happen?

11:56.116 --> 11:57.348
It's gonna happen.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.350
You're gonna die.

12:12.264 --> 12:13.064
- Thank you, dad.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.134
- There you go.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.970
- Raymond, you know
we're all afraid of death,

12:18.972 --> 12:22.107
But the important thing
is to be ready, see?

12:22.109 --> 12:25.376
Your father and I
have all we need right in here.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.912
We have our will

12:27.914 --> 12:29.814
And our insurance

12:29.816 --> 12:34.419
And a deed to our burial plot.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.454
- Where's the permit
to the neighbors' parade?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.763
- Frank.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.997
Frank, what is this?

12:45.999 --> 12:46.998
- What?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.933
- Our joint burial plot--

12:48.935 --> 12:50.068
It only mentions one.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.436
Where's the other plot?

12:51.438 --> 12:52.504
- What?
Who cares?

12:52.506 --> 12:54.939
I sold it.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.376
- You sold half
of our joint burial plot?

12:58.378 --> 13:01.045
- The people next to us
had an unexpected death.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.814
They were very upset.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.517
I got twice
what I paid for it.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.485
- It wasn't yours
to sell!

13:07.487 --> 13:09.521
- I sold my half
of the plot.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.256
- How do you know
it wasn't my half, frank?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.791
I always sleep
on the left.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.131
- And when were you going
to tell me about this?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.033
- I wasn't.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.936
I figured if you went first,
you couldn't yell at me,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.805
And if I went first,
yell all you want.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.548
- You have always wanted
to leave me, haven't you?

13:36.550 --> 13:38.883
- Till death do us part,
marie.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.884
After that,
you're on your own.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.258
- Why don't you fulfill
one of my dreams

13:47.260 --> 13:49.127
And leave me alone now?

13:49.129 --> 13:52.297
- Holy crap, we found
something we have in common!

13:53.999 --> 13:55.166
- How bad can death be?

14:06.145 --> 14:07.178
Hey, corn flake.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.413
- Hi.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.848
- Hey, guys.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.149
- You're in
a good mood, huh?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.451
- Yeah, I did a lot of
productive thinking today.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.452
- Yeah?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.887
- Gonna get cremated.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.526
- What?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.127
- Yeah.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.863
Yeah, I think it just
makes sense, you know?

14:24.865 --> 14:26.231
More sense than burial.

14:26.233 --> 14:30.268
I'm not all that gung ho
about decomposing.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.203
- How did you get onto this?

14:32.205 --> 14:34.405
- Look, it pays
to think about these things.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.107
Oh, hey, don't be
like that, either.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.977
I don't want
a big, sad funeral, you know?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.379
Make it like
a celebration, you know?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.114
People telling stories,

14:43.116 --> 14:44.482
Funny anecdotes about me,
you know?

14:44.484 --> 14:45.483
Like a roast.

14:48.954 --> 14:51.522
- What is wrong with you?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.091
- Good news.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.926
[laughs]

14:54.928 --> 14:57.262
I found a cemetery
that can fit us all in.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.068
- Uh, misery,
your company's here.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.906
- Look.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.241
It's beautiful.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.610
But it may be
a little tight.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.646
See, one of us
has to be vertical.

15:18.384 --> 15:19.450
- I don't know, ma.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.585
I'm thinking of going
cremation.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.986
- Ohh!

15:21.988 --> 15:24.322
You want to go off
on your own too?

15:24.324 --> 15:27.625
This family
is falling apart.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.960
- This does look nice,
though.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.261
- See?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.397
Debra, would you mind
being the vertical one?

15:34.300 --> 15:35.466
- Why debra, ma?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.968
- Well, it can't be
your brother.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.102
His head would
stick out of the ground.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.639
- Hey.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.207
How about a wood chipper?

15:43.209 --> 15:46.444
Then we can all fit into
one big trash bag.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.280
- That's morbid, dear.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.083
- Yes.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.618
- Deb, you should
look at this.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.353
This is pretty good.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.188
Deb.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.990
Deb!

15:58.992 --> 16:00.224
You're gonna die, you know!

16:05.397 --> 16:08.166
- Deb, look, I know
you're not excited

16:08.168 --> 16:11.235
About spending eternity
with my parents,

16:11.237 --> 16:13.271
But, you know, it's not going
to be like now

16:13.273 --> 16:16.107
When all they have to do
is cross the street.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.110
I mean, they're gonna have
to bust out of their coffins,

16:19.112 --> 16:24.649
And you know, they
tunnel through the dirt

16:24.651 --> 16:25.717
With, you know--

16:25.719 --> 16:28.486
[growls]

16:28.488 --> 16:31.522
Just to get to our coffin,

16:31.524 --> 16:34.025
And then the, you know, banging,

16:34.027 --> 16:36.361
And we could pretend
we're not even there.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.395
- Shut up, shut up!

16:37.397 --> 16:39.297
Would you stop it?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.633
Stop talking about coffins.

16:42.635 --> 16:46.104
- So you want to do
cremation with me?

16:46.106 --> 16:49.340
- Ray, you're supposed to be
having a midlife crisis,

16:49.342 --> 16:52.610
Not an end-of-life crisis.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.212
- Hey, look, don't tell me

16:54.214 --> 16:56.147
How to have
a midlife crisis, okay?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.582
What would you know
about it?

16:57.584 --> 17:01.352
- Because I've already
had mine!

17:01.354 --> 17:03.521
- Really?

17:03.523 --> 17:06.691
- Yes, a while ago.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.792
- Oh, was that the perm?

17:14.266 --> 17:15.566
- No.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.567
- 'cause that didn't look good.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.670
- It was two years ago.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.374
- Well, you never acted like you
were having a midlife crisis.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.810
- Ray, look at me.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.446
I am rubbing cream
on my hands.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.115
Do you know why
I'm rubbing cream on my hands?

17:32.718 --> 17:35.153
- Because it's hand cream?

17:39.158 --> 17:40.625
- No, because my skin

17:40.627 --> 17:42.193
Isn't as soft and smooth
as it used to be.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.394
Have you noticed?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.729
- Well, I didn't want
to say anything--

17:44.731 --> 17:45.763
- Shut up, ray.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.237
That is why every night,
I take this cream

17:53.239 --> 17:55.706
And desperately try
to turn back the clock,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.775
And even though I know
this is a losing battle,

17:57.777 --> 18:00.078
I still do it anyway.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.748
That is how you have
a proper midlife crisis.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.084
You do not start
planning your death.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.518
You go into denial

18:07.520 --> 18:09.320
Like a normal person!

18:11.423 --> 18:12.523
Give me your shoes.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.691
- What?

18:13.693 --> 18:17.361
- Give me your shoes.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.698
- All right, but I think
my shoes are soft enough.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.134
- Give them to me.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.669
When you started
going all nuts

18:24.671 --> 18:26.704
About the height thing,

18:26.706 --> 18:28.673
I bought these as a joke,

18:28.675 --> 18:31.809
But now I think
they're actually gonna help.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.678
So stick these on.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.779
- Oh, come on.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.214
These aren't going
to do anything.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.782
- You want to be
6 feet tall?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.283
Put them on.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.385
- I'm not wearing lifts.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.453
- They're not lifts.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.888
They're extra-thick
odor eaters.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.192
Two birds with one stone.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.632
- Look, this doesn't really mean
I'm 6 feet tall.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.701
- Hey, this cream doesn't mean
my hands are any softer

18:56.703 --> 18:58.369
Than they used to be.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.437
- I don't know.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.439
I'm talking about death
here, okay?

19:01.441 --> 19:02.874
You really think
some cheap insoles

19:02.876 --> 19:04.909
Are gonna change
my whole outlook on--

19:04.911 --> 19:06.744
Hey, these are kind of bouncy.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.312
- Oh, yeah?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.681
A little spring
in your step there, young man?

19:10.683 --> 19:14.652
- Mm, yeah, but who am I
really fooling here?

19:14.654 --> 19:18.856
- Hey, you only got to fool
one person,

19:18.858 --> 19:20.858
And if I recall,
that person once asked me

19:20.860 --> 19:22.226
If jell-o was a fruit.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.703
- Yeah, yeah.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.905
- Listen,

19:33.907 --> 19:36.474
You do whatever
you need to do.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.576
As for me, I am going to
put these tea bags

19:38.578 --> 19:39.911
On my puffy eyes

19:39.913 --> 19:41.612
And dream about
my bed-and-breakfast

19:41.614 --> 19:44.315
By the lake.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.583
Ah, good night.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.718
- Hey, can you put these
in sneakers?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.187
- [sighs]

19:49.189 --> 19:51.222
Put them anywhere you want.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.894
- [humming]

19:56.896 --> 19:57.895
Ha-hah!

20:00.732 --> 20:03.201
Feeling tall
and smelling good.

20:06.738 --> 20:07.738
- Idiot.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.380
- Frank, you want
your ice cream or not?

20:16.382 --> 20:18.482
- He's not here, ma.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.684
- Where'd he go?

20:19.686 --> 20:20.751
- I don't know.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.787
He said ray
got him thinking.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.222
- Ray got him thinking?

20:24.224 --> 20:26.691
- Yeah, you believe that?

20:26.693 --> 20:27.692
- About what?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.694
[piano lounge music]

20:29.696 --> 20:35.666
- [singing]
I left my heart

20:35.668 --> 20:42.440
In san francisco

20:42.442 --> 20:43.608
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.911
My wife thinks
I'm in the bathroom.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.916
[singing]
high on a hill

20:51.918 --> 20:55.019
It calls to me
