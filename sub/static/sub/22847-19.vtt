00:01.252 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.504 --> 00:06.465
If there's a chance to save your life,
why not try?

00:06.841 --> 00:08.718
What if Cybertek has the key
to saving you?

00:08.968 --> 00:11.137
<i>Cybertek's the same company
that built Deathlok's leg.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.681
- The answer's no.
- About that Deathlok program,

00:13.848 --> 00:16.100
I'm gonna do some digging,
see what else I can find.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.770
- Glenn, are you ready to comply?
- I'm happy to.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.982
Talbot, stop.
Why are you trying to get into the hangar?

00:27.903 --> 00:28.904
She's the Destroyer.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.744
Ruby! No!

00:35.327 --> 00:36.746
Yo-Yo, what did you do?

00:37.288 --> 00:39.874
- I found what you're looking for.
- My gravitonium.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.668
S.H.I.E.L.D. has it.
They won't give it willingly.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.420
You'd have me kill them?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.380
I have no reason to stop you.

00:57.808 --> 00:58.976
<i>Four-three point nine...</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:03.355
<i>four-six-two dash seven-six
point one-one-nine-one.</i>

01:04.272 --> 01:06.025
<i>Four-three point...</i>

01:07.068 --> 01:10.905
nine-four-six-two dash seven-six
point one-one-nine-one.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.325
Four-three point nine-four-six-two...

01:15.743 --> 01:17.828
dash seven-six
point one-one-nine-one.

01:18.746 --> 01:22.708
Four-three point
nine-four-six-two dash seven-six

01:22.917 --> 01:24.126
<i>point one-one-nine-one.</i>

01:24.585 --> 01:26.045
<i>Four-three point
nine-four-six-two...</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:28.089
Once <i>Zephyr One</i>
breaks through the upper atmosphere,

01:28.172 --> 01:32.134
we can slingshot the gravitonium
at high velocity into the Sun,

01:32.426 --> 01:33.928
destroying it for good.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.598
As anxious as we are to contain an element

01:37.765 --> 01:39.892
that may cause the future destruction
of the planet...

01:40.601 --> 01:42.937
we have to get <i>Zephyr</i> ready
for space travel first.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.396
"Future destruction"?

01:44.855 --> 01:46.357
It's complicated. Just go with it.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.067
- So, how close are we?
- On the <i>Zephyr,</i>

01:48.234 --> 01:50.361
RCS thrusters are operational
on the gravitonium.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.530
We're nearly finished
extracting residual traces

01:52.696 --> 01:55.157
from the machine which seems
to have refined the element in some way.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.159
It should be enough
to power the pseudo-gravity engine.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.786
So, in other words, we're close.

01:59.245 --> 02:01.122
I've kind of been consulting, so...

02:01.580 --> 02:03.666
Meanwhile,
Carl Creel still needs medical help.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.585
And I think we should get Robin
and Polly somewhere safe, too.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.920
- After General Talbot...
- He's not going anywhere.

02:09.547 --> 02:12.133
I know,
but I've been talking to Tony Caine.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.803
- What, my Tony? The Candyman?
- He's arranged for Creel's treatment,

02:16.137 --> 02:19.431
and he says he could take care
of Robin and Polly for now.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.100
Great. Do it.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.310
- Maybe Davis can...
- I'll take him.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.896
It's the least I can do
after dragging them out of hiding.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.315
Unless there's some objection.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.319
No. They'll be safer, not here.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.071
Well, make it quick.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.116
General Hale's MIA,
and I doubt she took an early retirement.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.493
Wait, explain to me how she got away.
Didn't you have them contained?

02:39.660 --> 02:40.828
Yeah, we did.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.039
- That girl was a ticking bomb.
- And she went off when you cut her throat.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.876
A gravity surge knocked everyone back
and disrupted our equipment.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.252
She slipped away.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.505
I was afraid you'd have to quake Ruby
and crack the Earth.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.674
That shouldn't even be an issue,
speaking of cutthroat.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.634
- All right, let's keep it productive.
- There would already be a crack

02:55.718 --> 02:58.053
- in the universe if you hadn't.
- Look, I did what I did.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.306
I'm not proud,
but it was the right choice.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.559
It was revenge.
You let your emotions get the best of you.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.895
Ruby should be locked up,
and she's not the only one.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.647
All I did was kill the person
called the Destroyer of Worlds.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.317
That's what Daisy was called.
We're lucky you didn't cut her throat.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.195
Just stop, Deke. The point is,
you don't make that decision.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.323
Then who does? You?
We all have blood on our hands.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.159
- Why am I being singled out?
- That's not what we do here.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.287
- This is S.H.I.E.L.D. We protect.
- She was a psychopath.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.497
- Ask Fitz.
- Yeah, just look at his cracked rib.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.000
- If you'd have seen what she was like...
- I didn't get a chance.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.919
I was too busy screaming
to be let out of a cell.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.170
Fitz shouldn't have even been there.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.380
- We delayed their plan!
- If we hadn't gone, Ruby would be free.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.174
But this isn't about the decision, is it?

03:35.466 --> 03:38.052
- This is about not following your orders.
- It's about both.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.637
Well, we didn't pick you.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.973
Coulson made that decision
and brought you back

03:43.224 --> 03:45.184
when he could have broken
that loop right there!

03:45.434 --> 03:46.518
All right, stop it.

03:51.649 --> 03:55.319
Yes, I made that decision,
and I'll be making the rest today.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.240
It's over.
Go do your jobs.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.083
So, is this normal?

04:10.334 --> 04:13.796
A weird mission? Yeah.
The fighting? That's new.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.562
Here to ask me if I'm okay?

04:31.689 --> 04:33.065
Not if I don't have to.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.400
Good.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.069
Then tell me what the Candyman's got.

04:37.987 --> 04:40.406
Thinks he found something connected
to the Deathlok program.

04:40.823 --> 04:44.076
- Garrett. Could be a stretch, but...
- It could keep Coulson alive.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.661
Whether he likes it or not.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.539
- So, Creel's been put on board?
- And he's on an IV drip,

04:48.706 --> 04:50.249
so he's not a danger to anyone.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.461
Once you have him,
Robin, and her mum set up. Go dark.

04:54.878 --> 04:59.550
- I'll cover for you here.
- Okay. Thank you for being sane.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.554
Robin said someday Coulson
would put all the pieces together.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.764
That has to mean something.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.526
But not according
to the multiverse theory.

05:17.735 --> 05:21.196
Hmm... I'm not sure you actually know
what "multiverse" means.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.241
That every choice we make spins out
a different timeline into the cosmos,

05:24.408 --> 05:27.244
and right now,
there are infinite parallel universes.

05:31.457 --> 05:34.168
But I am proof
that you can move between them.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.336
Or...

05:36.045 --> 05:38.714
you have proof that we are
in one timeline, in a loop.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.800
An infinite, intractable,
unchangeable loop.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.553
But if we succeed
in ridding the planet of gravitonium,

05:44.762 --> 05:47.264
then we break that loop
and prevent the Earth's destruction.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.809
Which is great, because that
definitely won't affect me at all.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.776
Look, it's not like
I'm just gonna blink out of existence.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.653
I lived in one timeline,
but now I live in this new one,

06:01.862 --> 06:05.282
and I think I'm gonna stay in the one
with the Sun and tacos and all that,

06:05.449 --> 06:07.201
'cause that's the multiverse.
That's science.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.371
Or you're a canary in a coal mine.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.457
I don't know
what either of those things are.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.254
We won't know if we're successful
at changing the future

06:19.421 --> 06:21.590
- unless you blink out of existence.
- Fitz...

06:22.800 --> 06:25.219
Jemma agrees. She actually wrote a paper
on the theory of...

06:25.386 --> 06:28.555
Nobody knows how it works.
Now, be careful.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.226
This substance is extremely unpredictable.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.855
Just make sure that gets to the <i>Zephyr</i>
in one... No, okay. You know what?

06:36.939 --> 06:38.899
- I think I might take that myself...
- Oh, quit it! I carried this stuff

06:38.982 --> 06:40.776
around on my belt for years, okay?

06:41.402 --> 06:45.030
And didn't you guys make a pledge
never to leave each other's side?

06:45.197 --> 06:47.241
You have to do that.
You have to keep that pledge for the,

06:47.408 --> 06:49.326
you know, the good of humanity.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.079
Your humanity, you mean.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.290
I appreciate how invested you are
in our future, but for now,

06:55.457 --> 06:57.376
let's worry about
the future of the planet.

07:02.965 --> 07:03.966
Four-three point...

07:04.883 --> 07:08.220
nine-four-six-two dash seven-six
point one-one-nine-one.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.731
Coulson!

07:21.275 --> 07:22.276
Coulson!

07:25.362 --> 07:26.363
Coulson!

07:28.031 --> 07:29.158
Coulson!

07:29.741 --> 07:31.452
Four-three point nine-four-six-two
dash seven-six

07:31.535 --> 07:33.245
- point one-one-nine-one.
- He's been yelling for you.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.621
I can fix this.

07:34.872 --> 07:35.956
Wait by the door.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.250
Four-three...
Four-three point nine-four-six-two...

07:41.545 --> 07:42.546
Phil.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.925
It's like a record that just keeps
skipping in my head, the numbers.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.722
- I was with Robin.
- Okay. Calm down.

07:52.014 --> 07:55.058
But I was at the control box. Why?
What was I doing there?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.728
- Trying to get the doors open?
- I'm Air Force, Phil.

07:57.895 --> 08:01.732
I know enough about navigational aids
to know that every hangar has a landing...

08:02.900 --> 08:03.901
assist.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.237
I had to comply.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.156
The landing-assist beacon.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.159
The only way to get a signal out.

08:12.618 --> 08:16.497
Four-three... point nine-four-six-two...

08:17.289 --> 08:18.874
point one-one-nine-one.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.586
Phil, tell me
that's not what I think it is.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.797
Our location.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.367
It came out of nowhere.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.495
- Any word from outside?
- They jammed our communications

08:56.745 --> 08:58.497
and exterior cameras.
As far as we can tell,

08:58.747 --> 09:00.666
both the Lighthouse and River's End
have been cut off

09:00.916 --> 09:02.918
- from the rest of the world.
- That's not reassuring.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.879
<i>Greetings,
elite citizens of the Lighthouse.</i>

09:06.088 --> 09:08.048
<i>Project Reclamation has been triggered.</i>

09:08.257 --> 09:11.677
<i>It appears you're experiencing
an apocalypse-level event.</i>

09:12.678 --> 09:14.388
- This guy again?
<i>- Please remain calm.</i>

09:14.596 --> 09:18.475
<i>This moment in human history
is what this bunker was designed for.</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:20.686
That actually is kind of reassuring.

09:20.978 --> 09:25.190
<i>Please go to the main computer terminal
and choose from the following options.</i>

09:27.234 --> 09:31.405
<i>If the Lighthouse is experiencing
an extreme-weather event, press one.</i>

09:31.572 --> 09:33.448
Agent Coulson,
I can't silence the alarms.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.619
<i>If you're experiencing a nuclear attack,
press two.</i>

09:38.328 --> 09:41.498
- Screw it.
<i>- For an alien invasion, press three.</i>

09:41.790 --> 09:45.002
<i>You have selected nuclear attack.
For your own health, safety,</i>

09:45.210 --> 09:46.461
<i>and radiation protection,</i>

09:46.712 --> 09:50.507
<i>all outer doors will remain sealed
for 15 years.</i>

09:51.133 --> 09:53.552
- Did he just say 15 years?
- How was I supposed to know

09:53.760 --> 09:55.262
there would be an "alien invasion" option?

09:55.470 --> 09:59.141
You always listen to the whole menu.
Always!

10:14.823 --> 10:18.994
You may be noticing that the Lighthouse
is going into lock down mode.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.081
<i>This is not a drill.
The Lighthouse is keeping us safe.</i>

10:23.498 --> 10:26.376
<i>All exits, including the hangar
have been sealed</i>

10:26.585 --> 10:29.254
<i>to protect us from any outside intrusion.</i>

10:29.921 --> 10:34.551
<i>Which is good, 'cause there is currently
a sizeable alien spaceship overhead.</i>

10:35.218 --> 10:39.681
<i>Oh, and due to a technical malfunction,
the Lighthouse thinks</i>

10:39.890 --> 10:42.768
we're under nuclear attack,
so we may be trapped inside

10:43.101 --> 10:44.561
for 15 years...

10:45.103 --> 10:46.980
- ish.
- No, no, no.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.900
I am so stupid. Why am I still in here?

10:50.067 --> 10:52.277
<i>I'm sure there's a way around that.
So, in the meantime...</i>

10:52.778 --> 10:54.029
there's no reason to panic.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.281
The Lighthouse
survives the Earth cracking apart,

10:56.448 --> 10:59.493
so one flying saucer,
probably no big deal.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.539
<i>All Lighthouse survival systems
are operational. Good luck.</i>

11:04.915 --> 11:08.919
<i>You're humanity's last hope.
Your survival is essential.</i>

11:13.173 --> 11:15.008
Oh! Now what?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.429
Oh, hey.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.432
- I know this guy.
<i>- Phil Coulson.</i>

11:23.225 --> 11:24.601
<i>Humanity's shield.</i>

11:25.102 --> 11:27.354
Yeah, I remember you, too.
The lighting wasn't great,

11:27.604 --> 11:29.022
but the whole vision thing
was hard to forget.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.691
Did General Hale send you?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.360
<i>You will be dealing with me now.</i>

11:34.027 --> 11:35.946
<i>I'm here for what was promised.</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:39.991
<i>- The gravitonium.</i>
- Yeah, that's gonna be a hard pass.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.329
Maybe you haven't realised it yet,
but this bunker, it's apocalypse-proof.

11:44.579 --> 11:48.458
It can withstand a nuclear blast.
We have years of food, water, and air.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.168
- Is that true?
- Not good food.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.962
And pretty soon,
the world's gonna realise

11:52.129 --> 11:54.965
there's this giant ship in its atmosphere,
and I'm thinking

11:55.132 --> 11:56.800
in the current political climate,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.261
won't be long
before you're blown out of the sky.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.558
Too much?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.948
If you're here for the update,
tell Coulson the communication relay

12:20.115 --> 12:21.199
doesn't work, either.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.329
We don't have time for this.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.875
We might be stuck in here for 15 years.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.586
You think you can avoid me
for that long?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.340
- I want to explain.
- Which part?

12:38.717 --> 12:40.260
- I was trying to save you.
- Yeah.

12:42.971 --> 12:43.972
Not this again.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.895
You need to listen.
You saw her. Me in the future.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.647
I spoke to her.
She warned me of all of this.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.775
I don't wanna hear it
and I don't wanna know.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.443
She was trying to help us, Mack.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.780
To prevent this,
to keep me from losing you.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.033
- She said things...
- And it's making you crazy.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.660
This whole future thing
has got you all acting crazy.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.953
I don't want to know.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.790
I'm just trying to fix the problems
right in front of me,

13:09.956 --> 13:12.083
not get my mind twisted
trying to figure out what comes next.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.045
- We already saw what comes next!
- Yeah, so you're willing to do anything,

13:15.212 --> 13:16.630
no matter who it hurts!

13:21.551 --> 13:22.928
We've been through too much.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.097
It messed you up.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.601
Thanks for the reminder, Mack.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.815
You don't even look at me the same.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.694
You know that's not what I meant.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.114
- No wonder you're pulling away.
- You're pushing me away.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.784
You think I don't care about
what happened to your arms?

13:45.951 --> 13:47.244
You don't care enough.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.913
How can you not want that girl to suffer
for what she did?

13:50.080 --> 13:53.041
I wanted to beat her senseless,
but that's not what we do!

13:53.291 --> 13:54.334
That's not us!

13:54.626 --> 13:57.546
- We turn the other cheek.
- Would you say that to May?

13:57.879 --> 13:58.922
Huh?

14:00.215 --> 14:03.468
That she could've saved that little girl
in Bahrain? No.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.472
Because she made the tough choice
to save lives.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.559
In the Framework, you saw the alternative.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.228
In the future...

14:15.647 --> 14:16.773
we swore...

14:21.486 --> 14:24.781
- We swore we wouldn't lose ourselves.
- I know.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.119
Or lose each other.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.622
I know.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.207
I love you.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.711
I'm doing this for you,
but you need to believe me.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.714
You need to trust
that I know what I'm doing.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.675
Please, Mack.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.468
You know me.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.430
You know I may run away...

14:49.264 --> 14:51.474
but I always come back to where I started.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.604
I know.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.693
I just don't know
if I'll be here when you do.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.426
- Mack?
- Um... Says the relay's done.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.761
That's all he said?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.096
No.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.062
Look... I can't tell you
if what you did was right or wrong.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.730
That's up to you to decide.

15:40.065 --> 15:43.526
But it doesn't just change you.
It changes how people see you.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.238
And the only thing you can do
is make peace with it.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.241
I'm trying.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.959
- Daisy should be back by now.
- I can't get a line out.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.294
But you should be able
to get a signal in, right?

16:01.378 --> 16:03.254
What if she never made it
out of our airspace at all?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.632
- We would know. Can't we try...
- What if that ship fired on them?

16:05.799 --> 16:06.800
Daisy's fine.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.511
She's gone dark.

16:14.432 --> 16:18.269
Daisy's mission wasn't just about Robin,
Polly, and Creel.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.231
- She's following a lead.
- A lead on what?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.484
- A way to keep you alive.
- What?

16:24.859 --> 16:27.696
I don't want that.
My orders are very clear about that.

16:28.238 --> 16:31.199
If there's a chance we can save you,
don't you think I'd take it?

16:31.366 --> 16:33.827
Right now, we all need saving
from our new overlords out there,

16:33.994 --> 16:37.205
- and our most powerful team member's gone.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.542
I killed Ruby for nothing.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.794
It didn't matter.
It's all happening right now.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.838
- Everything she told me.
- "She" who?

16:45.422 --> 16:46.589
This right here...

16:47.465 --> 16:48.758
this is how we lose.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.200
I could've warned myself
about a lot of things.

17:14.784 --> 17:19.204
Ruby, Hale, these aliens,
but instead she told me.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.376
Instead, she told me...

17:24.961 --> 17:26.671
"Coulson is dying,
and we need to let him."

17:28.798 --> 17:29.883
I'm sorry, sir.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.470
I hated keeping this.
I owe you so much.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.475
- You're my family.
- No, you're wrong.

17:38.850 --> 17:42.228
Robin said Coulson
puts the pieces back together.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.814
And you're saying
that we should've just left him

17:44.981 --> 17:46.483
to freeze to death
in the middle of nowhere.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.777
- I have to listen, May.
- In the middle of nowhere.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.362
She was me. She's lived through this,
through the loop,

17:51.529 --> 17:54.282
- who knows how many times.
- Exactly, you don't know.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.159
We haven't lost yet,

17:56.493 --> 17:58.453
and as far as we know,
they can't get in here...

17:58.661 --> 18:00.622
- They can go wherever they want.
- You better believe

18:00.789 --> 18:03.416
we're gonna do everything possible
to keep him alive.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.503
They can go wherever they want.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.204
Sensors, the cameras,
everything's glitchy.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.622
You getting the same thing I am?

19:24.789 --> 19:27.292
Energy fluctuations
all over the Lighthouse? Yeah.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.752
Which could mean they're already inside.

19:33.882 --> 19:34.883
God.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.094
- They're already inside!
- We don't even know who "they" are.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.389
I do.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.267
The Remorath are marauders.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.603
They're intergalactic scavengers
with no planet of their own,

19:46.769 --> 19:49.355
so they just take from others, and...
and wherever they go,

19:49.522 --> 19:52.025
- darkness follows.
- Darkness? That's a little vague.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.484
Well, it's not
the concept of darkness,

19:53.568 --> 19:55.945
it's literal darkness. It follows them,
because they're magic,

19:56.029 --> 19:57.739
and they can see in the dark,
and we can't,

19:57.822 --> 19:59.574
so it makes them kill us better with...

19:59.991 --> 20:01.075
with their claws.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.077
- Did you say, "claws"?
- Yeah.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.955
Did I not mention the foot-long
razor claws? Because, yeah.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.625
Well, people in the future survive.
There must be a way to stop them.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.544
No, we didn't stop them.
We just gave them whatever they wanted,

20:11.753 --> 20:12.754
and then...

20:12.921 --> 20:14.547
...said thank you and...

20:16.216 --> 20:18.051
cleaned up the bodies after they left.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.972
All right, this is no longer a siege,
this is an evacuation.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.516
Fitz, Simmons, see if you can find
a way to override

20:25.683 --> 20:29.479
the whole nuclear-contamination protocol.
We need to get the <i>Zephyr</i> airborne

20:29.646 --> 20:31.356
and out of here,
preferably with the gravitonium

20:31.522 --> 20:34.108
and our people on board.
How are your arms feeling?

20:34.609 --> 20:37.487
- Fitz recalibrated them, so I'm like new.
- Good, because we also need

20:37.695 --> 20:39.530
to get Talbot out of lockup,
and we have no idea

20:39.697 --> 20:41.741
- what kind of influence he's under.
- Well, if he makes a move,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.910
- I'll make a faster one.
- Great. Thank you.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.454
<i>Coulson, I think we might have something.
There's a...</i>

20:46.871 --> 20:49.040
<i>it's an analogue override on floor 17.</i>

20:49.207 --> 20:51.000
<i>It's the system
I check after the beacon explodes,</i>

20:51.167 --> 20:52.669
<i>- so I can rig up a bypass.</i>
- All right.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.421
If we can get the hangar doors open
and Deke and I can get the engines going,

20:55.505 --> 20:57.298
- we're in business.
<i>- I'll ready the gravitonium for travel.</i>

20:57.590 --> 21:00.885
<i>We've got Piper and Davis here to help,
and Fitz can take Agent Wahl for backup.</i>

21:01.052 --> 21:03.012
No, Simmons. You... You are the backup.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.306
You guys made a pledge
not to leave each other's side,

21:05.473 --> 21:07.475
- so I feel like...
<i>- Well, we don't really have much choice.</i>

21:07.767 --> 21:09.477
You can get Daisy to give you backup.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.187
She's strong, and she's protective...

21:11.354 --> 21:12.355
...and she...

21:12.522 --> 21:15.108
Wait, can't... Wait.
Can't Daisy just quake us out of here?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.235
- Why isn't she back yet?
- Ask May.

21:25.868 --> 21:26.869
All settled?

21:28.746 --> 21:29.914
Weird kid.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.459
Drew me a picture
of a blue lady juggling someone's balls.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.088
Pretty sure they were her balls.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.591
Aliens, you know?

21:41.926 --> 21:44.178
Have you seen
all this weird stuff happening

21:44.345 --> 21:45.596
- in New York?
- I can't watch the news.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.807
It makes me crazy.
Look, I got to get back, so...

21:47.974 --> 21:51.185
Agent Johnson...
you know why they call me the Candyman?

21:51.936 --> 21:53.229
Because the Candyman can?

21:54.814 --> 21:57.275
Project Deathlok had a lot of branches.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.778
It was a very complex web to untangle.
A lot of promises were made,

22:00.945 --> 22:02.071
- promises were broken and...
- Tony.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.781
All right. Short story long...

22:04.407 --> 22:07.827
it all goes back to this one Hydra dude
named John Garrett.

22:08.619 --> 22:09.704
Yeah, I'm familiar.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.124
He was being kept alive
by this secret sauce,

22:13.333 --> 22:15.043
all kinds of ingredients.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.712
He called it Centipede Serum.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.340
I think from the shape of it.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.426
That's... That's the last one, so...

22:25.011 --> 22:28.806
- don't waste it.
- I'm familiar. This is, um... a start.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.434
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, the thing about it is,

22:31.601 --> 22:34.395
though, Garrett's cocktail
had an extra healing component

22:34.562 --> 22:40.151
that was designed and developed
by the Nazis, so that's impossible to get.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.986
Nothing's impossible.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.613
It's one element. What is it?

22:43.988 --> 22:45.490
Ah. I have no idea.

22:46.324 --> 22:49.243
All I got was the name of some place
where they found it.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.246
And I can't find it on any map.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.962
That's cause it's not a place.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.883
Come on, Glenn.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.718
Just think.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.470
Just think.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.722
You can fix this. You can fix this.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.558
Just think.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.143
Just think.

23:14.769 --> 23:15.770
Just think.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.272
Just think.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.445
- Speedy!
- Don't.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.364
Back up.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.085
Bad aliens are coming,
and we're getting out.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.586
Coulson's orders. Come on.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.171
Oh, sorry.

23:42.713 --> 23:43.714
I can't do that.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.009
I caused this problem.

23:48.553 --> 23:51.514
You give me a gun, I'll help take out
as many of them as I can.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.266
Better yet, you know what you do?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.768
You get me a phone,
and I'll call in an air strike.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.937
But there's no way to call out.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.481
Then I'll send up a smoke signal.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.443
You're not Air Force anymore.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.993
Okay. Look, there's no need for that.
We're fine.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.621
That's not necessary, because I'll comply.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.999
I'll... That's a bad choice of words.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.417
I'll...

24:19.917 --> 24:21.169
cooperate.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.096
Sorry.

24:32.889 --> 24:33.973
Has to be done.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.767
I'm gonna make up for what I did.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.188
Make it right for that little girl.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.315
Robin and her...

24:43.566 --> 24:44.859
- her mother.
- I believe you...

24:45.359 --> 24:47.278
but we don't know
if you're the one in control.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.280
- Okay.
- So you follow my lead.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.699
Understand?

24:57.079 --> 24:58.456
<i>Do you think Deke's right?</i>

24:58.539 --> 25:00.625
Let me be clear. Deke is never right.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.461
We're in radio contact.
We've not split up. We're just...

25:09.717 --> 25:10.718
Jemma?

25:11.552 --> 25:12.803
Jemma, do you copy?

25:15.473 --> 25:16.474
We should go.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.076
No, no, no.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.327
Let's move.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.425
Oh, come on. Come on. come on.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.274
Get back!

26:13.114 --> 26:16.659
Shh! Shh! Shh!

26:29.255 --> 26:31.966
- What are you doing here?
- Without you, there is no me.

26:34.385 --> 26:37.388
Never been so happy
to meet someone so self-serving.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.350
If anyone asks,
we scared that thing off, okay?

26:41.892 --> 26:44.061
Or he knew he could just kill us later.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.481
Don't tell me that's the override.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.568
How the hell did he find that thing?
The Lighthouse is enormous.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.362
Doesn't matter.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.032
This was our only way out.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.378
All of you see where you're going,
where to find it.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.174
Then lay waste to anyone
who stands in our way.

27:23.768 --> 27:26.354
Evac is a no-go.
Fitz says the override's been destroyed.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.190
- They have the layout of this place?
- Who knows? They have teleportation tech,

27:29.357 --> 27:31.651
and they did show me visions
of far-off places.

27:31.901 --> 27:34.111
They'd be great to have on our team
if they were interested.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.947
- They may have a layout of this place.
- So, new plan?

27:37.239 --> 27:39.742
- Yeah, we rally together. Make a stand.
- Well, those doors

27:39.950 --> 27:41.619
- aren't gonna hold for long.
- I don't like our chances

27:41.786 --> 27:43.412
- without more ammo.
- We'll make it to the armoury

27:43.579 --> 27:45.456
- and bring back what we can find.
- Thanks, Agent Kim.

27:46.248 --> 27:49.377
A team of us is gonna take up
a defensive position here in control.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.837
Secure whatever firepower you can,
then head our way. You copy?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.547
Copy. I've got Talbot,
but we don't have much

27:53.714 --> 27:55.007
in the way of firepower.

27:55.466 --> 27:58.344
- We've got you.
- Heading your way.

27:59.887 --> 28:01.722
- Copy that.
<i>- Yeah. We copy, as well,</i>

28:01.889 --> 28:04.058
but we may have a bit of a logistics issue
in the lab.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.394
I don't think the gravitonium
can take the stairs.

28:08.229 --> 28:10.022
Deke thinks he can get
one of the elevators moving.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.357
Okay, brilliant.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.693
<i>Yeah, and, uh, just so
everybody's aware,</i>

28:13.859 --> 28:16.112
I think these guys have tech
that can shut down electricity,

28:16.278 --> 28:20.408
like, uh, an EMP,
so, flashlights, ICERs...

28:21.492 --> 28:23.744
walkies... they'll be useless.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.205
We need to see these things
if we're gonna stop them.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.208
Fire would work.
Just try and find something combustible.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.668
Then let's light 'em up.

28:32.628 --> 28:33.796
I always wanted to say that.

28:40.594 --> 28:43.764
They're here.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.905
- That's our exit. We're cut off.
- Oh, come on. We can fight these Remorons.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.450
Get these cuffs off. I can fix this.

29:02.825 --> 29:05.327
Coulson wants you safe,
which means I do, too. Come on.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.708
I can't be stuck in here again.
I can't be stuck in here again. I...

29:11.000 --> 29:12.710
There's so much I haven't seen.
I haven't seen the ocean.

29:12.877 --> 29:16.172
I haven't seen the Great Wall.
I haven't seen Orlando.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.842
What happened to your multiverse?
Thought you were everywhere all at once?

29:20.050 --> 29:21.135
Shut up!

29:22.511 --> 29:24.680
That is insane. I mean,
it's a miracle you survived all that

29:24.847 --> 29:26.223
- with just one scar?
- Yeah.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.641
You tell everyone that story?

29:27.892 --> 29:29.143
I don't think they care.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.813
- Piper, ICERs won't work.
- So, no modern weapons,

29:32.980 --> 29:35.858
- but yes to '70s era camping equipment?
- 'Fraid so.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.751
We saw them.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.753
They cut off our way to Control.

29:56.337 --> 29:57.755
We had nowhere else to go.

29:59.256 --> 30:02.009
- <i>Jemma, do you copy?</i>
- Yeah, Fitz, I think we're pinned down.

30:02.176 --> 30:03.803
We're going to have to make
our own stand here.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.639
They'll be coming for the gravitonium.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.557
I know.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.688
Sorry, Jemma.
I never should've left your side.

30:15.189 --> 30:17.107
<i>Wait, Deke.
Has he blinked out of existence?</i>

30:20.903 --> 30:23.405
- No, he's still here.
<i>- Then we're good.</i>

30:24.824 --> 30:27.284
- You heard him, they're coming after us.
- Okay.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.995
Davis, Piper, we're on point.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.956
Simmons, you stay here
and defend the lab,

30:32.122 --> 30:34.458
and if it comes to it, the gravitonium.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.337
What about me? Take the cuffs off.
I can fix this.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.713
You just stay back.

30:42.466 --> 30:43.467
Okay.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.479
Looks like you
and I are the last line of defence.

30:58.315 --> 31:01.360
- Thought you might need an escort.
- I think we can handle ourselves.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.164
Actually, it was a nice gesture.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.675
Go.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.470
Go!

31:44.236 --> 31:46.071
I can't see anything! We need recon!

31:48.032 --> 31:50.451
I just did. I couldn't see them,
but I could feel them all around me.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.119
We're outnumbered.

31:52.745 --> 31:53.787
Stay behind me.

31:54.288 --> 31:55.497
I can't be killed.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.207
Well, that makes two of you.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.377
<i>There's too many of them!</i>

32:00.461 --> 32:01.587
<i>Hold on as long as you can!</i>

32:01.712 --> 32:03.088
<i>Bar the doors all of them.</i>

32:03.172 --> 32:04.757
<i>Simmons, Yo-Yo, do you read?</i>

32:05.132 --> 32:07.551
<i>Do not proceed to Control.
We are surrounded.</i>

32:07.760 --> 32:09.470
<i>I repeat, we are surround...</i>

32:11.221 --> 32:12.556
Be careful, stay back.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.434
This is the last line.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.103
Here. Draw a line.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.439
Take a stand.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.107
Hold the line.

32:23.734 --> 32:25.569
Last line.
This is the last li...

32:39.959 --> 32:41.210
I can fix this.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.130
Talbot.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.083
A light cocktail of potassium,
glycerine...

34:04.626 --> 34:05.836
and a dash of sugar.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.342
Got it.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.471
Don't worry, Gramps.
If they want the gravitonium,

34:15.804 --> 34:17.139
they're gonna go through me.

34:17.848 --> 34:18.849
Deke...

34:22.226 --> 34:23.645
...whatever happens next...

34:25.522 --> 34:27.024
never call me "Gramps" again.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.614
Doubt that this will work
without electricity.

34:35.783 --> 34:36.784
Coulson.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.289
Really? Are you serious?

34:49.170 --> 34:50.297
Coulson?

34:55.719 --> 34:56.762
Sir?

34:58.305 --> 34:59.973
I don't think the ammo's
gonna get here in time.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.020
Okay, people. This is it.

35:13.862 --> 35:14.988
Here we go.

35:15.823 --> 35:18.992
If you need a gun, you'll take one, right?
Here, take this one.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.762
- They're everywhere, just like I said!
- Just hold steady!

36:35.444 --> 36:37.279
We don't have enough ammo
to hold them off!

36:43.076 --> 36:44.620
They're coming from all sides!

36:51.210 --> 36:53.629
Damn it! They jumped
in behind us! They're at the lab!

36:55.505 --> 36:57.341
Simmons, can you read me?

36:58.133 --> 37:00.719
- Simmons! Oh, something's wrong.
- No, nobody can reach anybody.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.012
It doesn't mean that she's...

37:07.476 --> 37:08.477
What was that?

37:46.640 --> 37:47.975
- I'm out!
- Me, too!

37:48.141 --> 37:49.518
Look, May,
this probably isn't the best time.

37:49.685 --> 37:50.686
It's not!

38:00.362 --> 38:02.281
Bullets didn't do much
to these guys anyway.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.135
Simmons.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.141
You okay?

39:53.892 --> 39:55.102
Where's Talbot?

40:33.432 --> 40:35.016
I told you I could fix this.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.682
<i>Citizens of the Lighthouse,</i>

41:15.765 --> 41:17.392
<i>I bring you excellent news.</i>

41:17.851 --> 41:20.854
<i>The outer atmosphere
shows no signs of contamination.</i>

41:21.021 --> 41:24.107
<i>Congratulations.
You have survived the nuclear apocalypse.</i>

41:24.274 --> 41:26.026
<i>The planet is safe again.</i>
