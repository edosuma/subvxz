WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.034
I'm home.

00:06.773 --> 00:09.640
Vivian, the birthday boy's here.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.818
Geoffrey? Carlton?

00:19.986 --> 00:21.715
Hilary?

00:21.888 --> 00:25.654
Ashley? Nicky? Anybody?

00:29.295 --> 00:30.990
Will?

00:39.773 --> 00:41.400
<i>I feel good</i>

00:42.509 --> 00:45.637
<i>Like I knew that I would, now</i>

00:45.812 --> 00:48.508
<i>I feel good</i>

00:48.681 --> 00:52.549
<i>Like I knew that I would</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:54.277
<i>So good</i>

00:54.454 --> 00:55.853
<i>So good</i>

00:56.022 --> 00:57.683
<i>I got you</i>

00:59.325 --> 01:00.690
<i>I got you</i>

01:00.860 --> 01:03.226
Surprise!

01:03.396 --> 01:06.297
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

02:23.243 --> 02:27.680
<i>- Happy birthday dear Uncle Phil
- Happy birthday dear Daddy</i>

02:27.847 --> 02:33.945
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

02:35.421 --> 02:36.979
Whoo!

02:39.092 --> 02:42.926
You better watch it, boy. Mess around,
blow that whole cake on the floor.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.188
Uncle Phil, come on now.

02:44.364 --> 02:47.231
How would you describe the look
on your face when we screamed "surprise"?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.391
Uh... Surprised?

02:49.569 --> 02:52.197
Man, you looked just like
a cow caught in the headlights.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.973
The correct term is
"deer caught in the headlights."

02:56.142 --> 02:57.905
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know.

02:58.077 --> 03:02.844
Forty-eight, 49, a jillion.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.752
- Mom, how old are you?
- Hmm?

03:08.988 --> 03:11.218
Younger than your father.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.059
- But everything's younger than Dad.
- Yeah.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.622
Such a kidder. Ha-ha-ha.

03:18.631 --> 03:23.295
But 50's gonna be a great year.
Not only for me, but for all of us.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.233
I got a son heading off to Princeton.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.468
Two daughters starting exciting lives
in New York.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.510
Another son starting kindergarten.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.171
And a nephew that's, uh...

03:36.382 --> 03:38.282
That's, uh...

03:39.219 --> 03:42.211
Hey, buddy,
you're gonna love kindergarten.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.219
Well, it looks like we're all in the fast lane.
Except for Will.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.088
I mean, someone has to be stuck
on the soft shoulder.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.500
Y'all hear what he said?
Stuck on the soft shoulder.

03:55.668 --> 03:58.831
Hey, are all the other munchkins
as funny as you?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.704
- Champagne.
- Oh.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.070
Great, I love champagne.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.639
I mean, I love the look of it.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.650
The color and the bubbles.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.915
Well, here's to my wonderful family.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.555
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.750
I have a little announcement
to make myself.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.595
I have decided to move back to London
to be near my son Frederick.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.027
- Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey?

04:27.200 --> 04:31.933
Well, I thought about it long and hard.
The time is right. He needs me.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.901
- Good luck, Geoffrey.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.771
Oh, Geoffrey, I'm gonna miss you.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.675
Oh, we have to have a special
going-away dinner for you.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.009
What do you wanna make?

04:47.086 --> 04:51.284
Let's have another toast.
To all of us going on with our new lives.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.651
And Will.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.853
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.697
Don't worry, Will,
you can come to kindergarten with me.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.162
Waa, pssh.

05:12.512 --> 05:17.381
Geoffrey, I know it's a little premature
and I know I really didn't have to...

05:17.550 --> 05:22.146
...but being the generous person that I am,
I got you a little going-away gift.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.085
And that's a real autograph.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.661
Go ahead, press the button.
Press the button.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.060
<i>Geoffrey, get in here, I need you.</i>

05:35.601 --> 05:37.501
Oh, don't you just love it?

05:38.037 --> 05:39.937
Love it.

05:42.442 --> 05:46.401
Hey, hey, morning, Uncle Phil.
Whoa, 50 and a day, man. How's it feel?

05:46.579 --> 05:49.275
I'm not getting older,
I'm just getting better.

05:49.449 --> 05:53.613
That's the same thing I'd say
if I was on the downside of the hill.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.751
Before I go to Princeton,
there's a few loose ends I'd like to tie up.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.358
I've taken the liberty
of re-drafting your will.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.427
Now, if you'll sign right here
and initial this little box...

06:03.596 --> 06:08.056
...in the event you lapse into a coma,
that'll give us the right to pull the plug.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.070
How about a little sensitivity?

06:13.606 --> 06:16.473
All right, but if he keels over today,
we're screwed.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.778
Morning, all. Isn't it a great day?

06:24.283 --> 06:25.875
Pssh!

06:26.052 --> 06:29.818
Happy birthday, Mr. Banks.
Heard you had quite a soiree last night.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.389
That's French for "shindig."

06:33.025 --> 06:34.993
What's French for "unwelcomed guest"?

06:36.662 --> 06:38.687
I bought this for you.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.894
They're false teeth.

06:50.042 --> 06:53.808
They were my grandmom's.
She don't need them no more.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.613
I know that look.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.079
You're not getting any younger.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.119
This isn't good for your back.

07:04.056 --> 07:05.250
I brought this on myself.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.251
Aah!

07:10.730 --> 07:13.563
Man, Uncle Phil,
you beat your own record by, like, 10 feet.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.030
Yeah.

07:15.668 --> 07:19.399
There he is. The oldest man in the world.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.474
Ahh!

07:24.010 --> 07:25.978
- I still got it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.477
Ah. I've been thinking,
with you going back to England...

07:33.653 --> 07:35.917
...there's going to be a big void
in my life.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.716
Master Carlton, we'll write.

07:38.891 --> 07:42.088
But that won't get my dry cleaning
picked up. Chop-chop, Geoffrey.

07:43.563 --> 07:47.397
And to think
I fished that boy out of the pool.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.803
Okay. I got the color swatches.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.063
This is gonna be so much fun,
living together.

07:53.239 --> 07:54.604
I know, I can't wait.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.004
Okay. Ahem.

07:58.344 --> 08:02.110
Eggshell in the kitchen
and taupe in the living room.

08:02.281 --> 08:03.373
I don't think so.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.285
We agreed I could pick out the colors.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.286
We agreed that you would have input.

08:11.190 --> 08:15.149
That's right, and I'm inputting these colors
into our apartment.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.027
My apartment.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.894
And I just changed my mind,
you'll have no input whatsoever.

08:23.369 --> 08:26.566
This is gonna be so much fun,
us living together.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.905
I'm gonna miss this time
we've spend together.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.548
Me working hard,
focusing on my career...

08:36.716 --> 08:41.551
...and you sitting around in the house
all day in your robe playing Nintendo.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.384
You always make me feel so, so superior.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.319
Like the story of the grasshopper
and the ant.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.759
The ant worked all summer long
storing up food...

08:51.931 --> 08:54.195
...while the grasshopper
frittered away his time.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.029
Well, the winter has come
and you've just been frittering.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.103
Frittering. Frittering. Frittering.

09:00.006 --> 09:04.534
See, now, that's where you're wrong.
See, the grasshopper hasn't been frittering.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.406
Unlike the ant,
the grasshopper had a life and friends.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.640
And once in a while, a couple
of little ladybugs would come over...

09:10.816 --> 09:13.751
...to spend some time with the grasshopper.
And on one weekend...

09:13.920 --> 09:17.356
You know the ladybug from the bookstore,
the one the ant has the crush on?

09:17.523 --> 09:20.924
She even came over to spend some time
with that fine grasshopper.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.592
The weekend he was away at Princeton.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.698
Well, what was she doing here?

09:28.467 --> 09:30.094
Frittering.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.067
Mm. She fritters so good.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.073
Ha-ha-ha. That's funny.
You're the funniest guy in the pool house.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.179
And soon enough, you're gonna be
the only guy in the pool house.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.440
With the rest of us
striking out on our own...

09:43.616 --> 09:47.211
...the only question is, who's gonna
move out first, you or Nicky? Ha, ha.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.351
Better hope he doesn't go
to boarding school.

10:00.833 --> 10:05.327
Hey, G. What's up, man?
Hey, look, I got this friend, right?

10:05.504 --> 10:08.564
He kind of got a little problem.
See, he got these three cousins...

10:08.741 --> 10:12.074
...and they're all moving on with new
and exciting lives and everything.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.137
Is your friend feeling pensive?

10:15.448 --> 10:19.612
My friend doesn't know
what pensive means.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.248
Is your friend feeling lost?

10:22.421 --> 10:24.912
Ah! Lost. Yeah, yeah. See, he's feeling lost.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.356
You know, he's feeling like the world
is just rushing by him, you know.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.722
Everybody's getting into
all these new things...

10:30.896 --> 10:33.694
...and he's just stuck
kicking it in the pool house.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.561
Well, I mean, you know, per se.

10:37.236 --> 10:40.364
You know, I mean,
I guess he's feeling embarrassed...

10:40.539 --> 10:43.337
...you know, that he's the only one
that ain't doing nothing.

10:43.509 --> 10:47.036
Well, then I suggest you tell your friend
the story my father told me.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.204
It's the tale
of the young Earl of Monroe...

10:49.382 --> 10:51.850
...who wanted to build a bridge
over the River Mersey.

10:52.018 --> 10:56.785
He labored for years and years and finally
he was all done and quite proud of himself.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.857
Okay. Okay. So I guess what you're saying
is I should just tell my boy...

11:01.027 --> 11:03.825
...that if he applies himself,
everything gonna be cool.

11:04.330 --> 11:09.461
Well, actually, when the earl completed
the bridge, he flung himself off it.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.368
- Dude killed himself?
- Quite.

11:12.538 --> 11:16.440
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master William,
I have dinner to prepare.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.867
That's the advice
that your father gave you?

11:20.079 --> 11:22.912
My father was not a well man.

11:27.053 --> 11:29.749
Geoffrey,
we are really gonna miss your cooking.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.446
Oh, not to mention your cleaning.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.355
I'll never find anyone
who can iron the way you do.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.327
Don't even go there.

11:39.832 --> 11:43.666
You know, Will, with Geoffrey leaving,
there's a job opening here in the house.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.833
Yeah, I guess I could start
by washing your pants in a thimble.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.369
You know, this is one of the last times...

11:51.544 --> 11:55.105
...that we'll all be sitting together
around this table for a while.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.079
We should cherish
these few moments we have as a family.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.987
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

12:03.155 --> 12:08.149
Oh, not to worry, Big Guy. Will's gonna be
sitting around this table for years to come.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.062
Leave Will alone. He can stay
in the pool house for as long as he wants.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.063
- Right, Daddy?
- Well...

12:15.234 --> 12:18.635
It's either that
or the Homeboy Homeless Shelter. Ha!

12:19.438 --> 12:23.397
For your information, midget boy,
I already got an apartment.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.203
You did?

12:25.377 --> 12:28.904
Well, yeah. You know,
I was gonna surprise y'all, you know, but...

12:29.081 --> 12:31.015
You're moving?

12:31.650 --> 12:34.210
- Yeah, I'm moving.
- Don't toy with my emotions, Will.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.822
I've been waiting a long time,
I'm very vulnerable.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.024
Look, I said, I'm moving, Uncle Phil.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.134
The pool house is mine. Yes.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.082
Oh, it's you.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.550
Circling apartments, eh?

13:08.721 --> 13:12.179
Looks like you've painted yourself
into a corner this time, Master William.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.825
Well, don't you worry about me.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.520
I'm one of the best corner-getter-outers
that there is. You'll see.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.857
But I'm saying, you know...

13:20.032 --> 13:22.432
I mean, you do got my back, right?

13:22.601 --> 13:26.367
Within a week, I shall be at 30,000 feet
headed to London...

13:26.539 --> 13:31.738
...with many tiny bottles of Jim Beam
dancing in front of me.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.004
But until then...

13:34.246 --> 13:35.736
...your back is mine.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.473
Thanks a lot, G.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.147
- Good morning, Will.
- Hey, what's up, Uncle Phil?

13:40.319 --> 13:43.880
I hope you didn't misconstrue
my enthusiasm over your leaving, last night.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.851
I'm really proud of you.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.684
Heh, heh.
In fact, I'm even a little envious.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.728
I mean, there's nothing more exciting
than change.

13:51.897 --> 13:55.389
You know,
I have a little story I'd like to tell you.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.504
When did the story fairy descend
on this house?

14:00.272 --> 14:02.365
Look, Uncle Phil, can we do that later?

14:02.541 --> 14:05.135
You know, I gotta go check out
a few things for my spot.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.437
Oh, well, sure. Sure.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.727
What do you want?

14:29.301 --> 14:32.498
Um... I'm here to see the apartment.

14:32.671 --> 14:36.334
Fine. Don't touch that channel!

14:37.343 --> 14:41.643
It's one bedroom with a bath.
One parking space.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.372
No loud music...

14:43.816 --> 14:47.047
That cupcake's mine!

14:54.326 --> 14:57.056
I'm sorry. You have company?

14:58.397 --> 14:59.955
No.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.626
I just thought somebody was there,
you know, because...

15:05.804 --> 15:07.897
No. I'm alone.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.612
<i>Did you ever see that movie
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?</i>

15:22.054 --> 15:26.013
Oh, I suppose I have to clean that up.

15:33.299 --> 15:36.666
Hold on.
Sir, I have the airline on the phone.

15:36.835 --> 15:41.135
In lieu of my spring bonus,
I think it would be a magnificent gesture...

15:41.307 --> 15:46.267
...if you sent me back to London first class
on the Concorde.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.648
What would you consider
an adequate gesture?

15:49.815 --> 15:53.046
Business class with a kosher meal.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.613
What would be less than adequate?

15:56.255 --> 15:58.621
Working here another year.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.281
I'll get back to you.

16:00.526 --> 16:04.622
Ah. There you are.
Sit down, we need to have a little talk.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.924
Will did it.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.033
No one did anything. Now sit down.

16:12.671 --> 16:16.004
Well, your mother and I have decided
since all of you are moving out...

16:16.175 --> 16:19.042
...that, well, we all need to be clear
on a few things.

16:19.211 --> 16:22.476
We expect you to behave yourselves
just as you do at home.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.172
The same rules apply.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.380
Then what's the point of moving?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.610
Can I have that one back?

16:30.356 --> 16:33.189
I don't know that these rules apply,
I'm 25.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.020
Hilary, you're 27.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.685
That doesn't leave this room.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.463
I'm gonna need you to look in
on your sisters on the weekend.

16:42.634 --> 16:46.593
Oh, great.
Now I can kiss Glee Club goodbye.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.205
Okay, are we done?

16:48.374 --> 16:51.104
I'd like to go over the schedule.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.845
We're gonna get together
on all major holidays. Thanksgiving...

16:55.014 --> 16:57.881
Oh, no, Dad. November's sweeps month.
No can do.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.916
We're gonna get together for Christmas.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.817
What if I meet somebody
and they invite me to their house?

17:04.990 --> 17:07.424
Well, what if I meet somebody?

17:09.795 --> 17:11.887
Well, what if she meets somebody?

17:12.263 --> 17:14.561
Dad, why don't we just see
what happens?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.429
No, we are not just gonna see
what happens.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.037
We're gonna get together
whether we want to or not...

17:20.204 --> 17:22.935
...because we're a family
and we love each other, right?

17:23.942 --> 17:25.500
- Yeah.
- Now get out.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.372
Okay.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.508
Now, out this window,
you get a ocean view.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.208
The sunsets here are fabulous.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.820
Oh, man, I gotta tell you,
this place is all that.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.618
And the price isn't too much because,
well, I am flexible.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.284
Man, this is less than what I'm paying now,
Mr. Clark.

17:43.462 --> 17:47.023
- No, call me Peter, huh?
- Oh, cool. Peter.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.291
Hey, so when you moving out?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.667
I'm not moving out.

18:03.849 --> 18:08.377
Geoffrey, I'm gonna need some things taken
care of in the pool house before I move in.

18:08.554 --> 18:11.523
Master Nicky,
I do sympathize with your plight...

18:11.690 --> 18:14.056
...but I leave in a matter of days.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.922
That's plenty of time to paint.
Chop-chop.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.925
Master William,
any luck with your search?

18:25.104 --> 18:28.562
Man, I saw some of the nastiest places
this city has to offer.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.867
Oh, well.
You'll have better luck tomorrow.

18:32.244 --> 18:34.940
Suppose you right
if I was gonna keep looking.

18:35.981 --> 18:41.248
G, what would you say if I said
I think I may have made a mistake?

18:41.420 --> 18:45.447
The word "duh" comes to mind.

18:46.992 --> 18:49.324
Well, you know what?
I know what I'm gonna do.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.464
I'm gonna march right up to Uncle Phil
and just tell him I lied.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.060
I mean, I'm a man, you know.
I can admit to my mistakes.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.670
That's all it was, a mistake.
Mistakes can be undone.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.430
You learn, you move on. So what?

19:01.607 --> 19:04.633
I can admit I was completely wrong
and I can take my lumps.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.745
Lumps I earned. A man's lumps.

19:07.913 --> 19:11.178
Uncle Phil can relate to that.
He a man, he lumpy.

19:12.384 --> 19:15.649
- Well said.
- I'm gonna march right up to Uncle Phil...

19:15.821 --> 19:19.154
...and I'm gonna say,
"This man is staying in the pool house."

19:19.324 --> 19:21.622
Good show, Master William.

19:22.094 --> 19:25.257
And I wouldn't miss it for the world.

19:25.697 --> 19:28.427
- What does he want now?
- Who knows?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.000
Everyone, glad you're here.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.570
Your mother and I
have an announcement to make.

19:33.739 --> 19:37.106
Dad, we've already been through this.
We'll give you Columbus Day.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.569
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I have an announcement to make too.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.407
Will, you wanna go first?

19:42.581 --> 19:44.947
- No, you can go ahead, Uncle Phil.
Ah. Thank you.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.781
In light of all the changes afoot, your
mother and I have decided to change too.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.150
We're gonna sell the house.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.954
- You're really selling the house?
- Yeah. What do you think?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.953
What are you, crazy?

19:59.998 --> 20:02.193
I mean that in the most respectful way.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.866
I know what this is.
I did an entire show on it.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.769
"The change of life."

20:10.075 --> 20:12.009
Are you experiencing mood swings?

20:12.177 --> 20:13.644
Trouble sleeping?

20:13.812 --> 20:16.280
Do your breasts ache?

20:18.317 --> 20:21.548
I am not going through menopause.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.445
Mood swing at 3 o'clock.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.387
Your father and I decided that
since all of you were moving out...

20:27.559 --> 20:29.891
...we don't need a house this big anymore.
Oh, whoa, whoa.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.522
Hold on. I mean, do we really wanna
sell this house in a soft market?

20:34.700 --> 20:38.101
Oh, yeah. It's soft, Uncle Phil.
Marshmallowy.

20:39.271 --> 20:42.172
I am selling this house
for a lot more than I paid for it.

20:42.341 --> 20:45.003
Then let's dump this puppy.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.635
Excuse me, I love this house.
I grew up in this house.

20:48.814 --> 20:52.807
Yeah, she grew up in this house,
and Carlton still has a lot of growing to do.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.616
Where would we go for the holidays?

20:55.787 --> 20:58.722
Wait, whatever happened
to November sweeps, huh?

20:58.890 --> 21:02.121
- Well, it...
- Ashley, "I might meet somebody"?

21:02.294 --> 21:03.693
And...

21:03.862 --> 21:05.989
Ashley, "I might meet somebody"?

21:07.532 --> 21:09.727
Dad, we'll come home for the holidays.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.926
See, they wanna come home
for the holidays.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.835
No, you kids were right. We're not gonna
be spending a lot of time together...

21:16.008 --> 21:18.602
...so there's no reason
why we can't move back East.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.711
We wanna be close to you guys.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.177
Well, why just be close?
Let's all live together.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.406
No.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.879
Did I say that?

21:30.555 --> 21:32.523
It's gonna be great.

21:32.691 --> 21:36.457
Oh, Will, we were so caught up in our own
excitement, we forgot about your news.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.459
Well, what do you wanna tell us?

21:38.930 --> 21:40.864
Oh. Um...

21:41.033 --> 21:43.331
I bought a monkey.

21:44.305 --> 21:50.775
