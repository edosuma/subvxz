00:37.663 --> 00:39.415
Oh, my God!

00:39.498 --> 00:41.670
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you give me your location?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.547
Clearly, people here want some answers.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.842
- Breaking news...
- We have confirmed...

00:46.922 --> 00:49.425
- And the robbery happened around...
- At this time, information...

00:49.508 --> 00:51.636
...don't go near this area.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.971
...into the buildings here behind us...

00:54.054 --> 00:58.392
The question on everyone's mind is how did
this situation get out of control here?

00:58.475 --> 01:02.524
...so the pictures you're seeing,
this is a major incident.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.025
...police have a suspect in custody.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.234
What drives a person to commit a crime?

01:06.316 --> 01:09.656
To destroy? To weaken someone's resolve?

01:09.736 --> 01:13.115
Vengeance? Spite?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.450
Religion?

01:14.533 --> 01:16.661
Money?

01:16.743 --> 01:19.121
Communities, cities, entire countries

01:19.204 --> 01:22.294
are put beneath microscopes
and analyzed for their flaws,

01:22.374 --> 01:25.589
their weaknesses, so that one individual

01:25.669 --> 01:28.592
can find the smallest chink
in the system's armor

01:28.672 --> 01:31.175
and benefit from it.

01:33.969 --> 01:37.267
Clearly, this has been done
by an explosives expert.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.561
- Police say...
- My name is Lucas Nolan.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.394
I'm an interrogation specialist.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.605
I elicit useful information
from a suspect,

01:44.688 --> 01:50.614
build a rapport, and utilize
any techniques necessary to gather data.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.822
At least, that's what the book says.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.372
I'm good at it.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.035
No, I'm great at it...

01:58.118 --> 02:00.541
Peeling away every layer
of a person's mind

02:00.621 --> 02:02.919
and uncovering a clue
at the root of a problem.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.084
And if you know what you're looking for...

02:07.878 --> 02:11.428
you can prevent it
all from ever happening.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.061
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Code 236, we're under fire!

02:28.482 --> 02:30.529
Shots fired! Shots fired!

02:30.609 --> 02:33.198
Officer pinned down, taking heavy fire!
Need backup!

02:33.278 --> 02:36.868
All units, all units, please respond.
Officers need assistance.

02:36.948 --> 02:41.328
Shots fired. Go to this location:
2543 North 6th Avenue.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.039
All units, officers need assistance.
Shots fired.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.928
Where the hell is that backup?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.267
Who the hell are you?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.181
Nolan, FBI. What do we got?

02:58.261 --> 03:00.935
Suspect robbed the Bank of America.
Tracked his car here.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.036
Four seconds a clip.
Probably an M4 automatic.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.958
Five seconds to reload.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.387
Hope he's consistent.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.222
Hey, where are you going?

03:42.305 --> 03:46.560
One, two, three, four...

04:02.451 --> 04:05.500
- What the hell is he doing?
- I have no idea.

04:08.915 --> 04:14.012
One, two, three, four.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.142
Four seconds. You're out.

04:21.218 --> 04:22.320
Shit.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.072
How'd you know he was out?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.873
Lucky guess.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.081
Can I help you?

06:54.164 --> 06:56.883
Are you in charge of bomb threats?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.590
- Excuse me?
- You know,

07:00.670 --> 07:03.468
this bomb is going to go off
at this place, at this time.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.767
You should be really scared type of thing.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.185
When exactly is this bomb gonna go off?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.438
Now.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.948
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands now!

07:28.031 --> 07:29.202
Son of a bitch.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.126
On the ground. On your knees now!

07:47.509 --> 07:49.472
All right, go through.

07:49.552 --> 07:53.268
- Next. ID?
- Good to go.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.602
- How bad is it?
- No casualties, but bad enough.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.562
Sixty square blocks with no electricity.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.067
It'll take at least 12 hours
to get it back online.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.149
Good news, we still got power.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.486
That's not good news.
We could have the day off.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.036
Yeah, I heard that.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.368
Next. All right, go through.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.168
Next.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.769
We should get this started.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.945
A man who gives himself up like that
knows he's about to be interrogated.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.942
- Who's our guy?
- He's a memory savant.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.652
He remembers anything and everything.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.324
And he plays back highlights
in his mind better than ESPN.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.532
He's a walking, talking encyclopedia.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.037
Never pretends he has
more knowledge than the suspect

08:54.117 --> 08:55.744
to gain the upper hand because he does.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.171
How is that possible?

08:58.646 --> 09:02.712
- What'd I miss?
- Nice of you to join us.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.631
Luke, you know Special Agent Sara Ward.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.554
Anti-terror, right?

09:09.591 --> 09:11.763
So what do we got on this guy?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.139
Not much.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.392
- Prints?
- Nope.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.144
- He filed them off.
- Or burned them.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.647
We're running his face through
the Bureau databases right now,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.900
- but so far...
- I get it.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.328
We got one wallet, empty.
Some kind of paint smudge on it

09:35.408 --> 09:37.911
and a key with the letters
"MS" scratched onto it.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.295
- How much time I got?
- You don't.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.551
You think there's another bomb out there?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.353
You two better be right about him.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.505
I'm Lucas Nolan.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.556
What's your name?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.469
You tell me.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.231
You read people for a living, don't you?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.732
Dave. No, or is it Bob?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.777
Or maybe a good old Tommy.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.485
- You don't look like a Tommy.
- Mm.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.616
I read books. Far less annoying.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.619
Then let's talk about books.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.327
"If a tree falls in a park
and there is no one to hear,

11:00.410 --> 11:04.375
it is silent, invisible, nameless.

11:04.455 --> 11:07.045
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.969
All meaning would vanish along with us."

11:13.298 --> 11:15.426
Let's talk about books now.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.135
What's he doing?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.686
Searching his memory house.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.437
Am I the only one in here who doesn't know
what the fuck a memory house is?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.270
It's a memorization technique.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.025
You see, our visual memory
is the strongest,

11:29.105 --> 11:32.445
so Lucas has created a home in his mind
to remember anything and everything.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.402
That sounds like bullshit to me.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
"If a tree falls in the park...

11:40.783 --> 11:43.623
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.126
All meaning would vanish..."

11:48.374 --> 11:50.171
William Fossett.

11:50.251 --> 11:54.300
Natural States,
originally published in 1754.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.719
However, he stole his line
of thinking from Berkeley,

11:56.799 --> 11:58.676
who asked the same question
44 years earlier

11:58.760 --> 12:01.388
with his Treatise on the Principles
of Human Knowledge.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.645
Section 45, if you wanna have a look.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.564
He's a game-changer.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.781
So you are familiar with the work.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.615
It is a simple question, really.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.823
Either you believe physical phenomena

12:19.906 --> 12:23.877
can exist outside the realm
of human perception or you don't.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.633
Come on. You must have an opinion.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.258
I'll answer one of your questions,
you answer one of mine.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.302
Sure.

12:37.382 --> 12:40.386
- Where were you born?
- That's his question?

12:40.468 --> 12:43.057
Iraq.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.266
Match up immigration records,
photos, whatever you got.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.441
Got it.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.442
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Gaza.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.274
He's playing us.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.734
Does it matter?

12:56.818 --> 12:59.321
Would you even be able
to tell the difference?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.701
- Hmm?
- Okay.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.622
- So you came here when you were...
- Ah, ah, ah.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.374
You're going to have to
earn your next question.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.876
I don't have time for games.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.550
No, you don't,
but you're going to play anyway.

13:15.003 --> 13:18.176
- What do you want?
- I want to be heard.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.930
But for that to happen,
I need someone to listen.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.728
And if I don't?

13:27.214 --> 13:29.479
You'll find out in 27 minutes.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.811
Becky?

13:32.186 --> 13:34.063
Done.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.110
America doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.945
It does today. And there are rules.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.200
Do we understand each other?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.952
I understand.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.000
Good.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.624
The rules are simple.

13:49.704 --> 13:55.336
They are based on truth
in a world where everybody lies.

13:55.418 --> 14:00.093
With the biggest liars winning elections
and the greediest companies thriving,

14:00.173 --> 14:06.055
I am going to tell you the truth
about who I am and what I want.

14:06.137 --> 14:10.859
Then I'm going to ask you a question
based on that truth.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.398
You get it right, you win a prize.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.280
You get it wrong, people die right now.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.032
I want electronic countermeasures
on this building.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.614
No wireless signals in or out.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.074
Got it.

14:27.158 --> 14:33.040
This whole nightmare of a country
is built on lies.

14:33.122 --> 14:37.463
Everywhere you look, women with fake tits.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.592
You turn on the television,
all you see are reality shows,

14:41.672 --> 14:46.845
homes none of us own, a leader who says
he's going to take care of people.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.892
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.849
All lies.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.357
And do you know which ones are the worst?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.274
The ones you come to believe.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.701
And what is the biggest lie of all?

15:05.113 --> 15:06.535
...the biggest lie of all.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.713
The American Dream.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.798
Well done.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.092
For that, you get a prize.

15:23.172 --> 15:28.554
- One question, one answer.
- Where's the next bomb gonna go off?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.855
Corner of Nicollet and 5th.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.435
Get PD to evac the buildings for one
square block and set up a hard perimeter.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.607
I want SWAT and EOD
on Nicollet and 5th now.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.400
What's there, Becky?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.859
Offices, storefronts, a tower, apartments.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.655
- Too much.
- What are you doing?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.612
You can't just walk away from him.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.660
- We're both coming with you.
- Absolutely not.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.662
- Why did he come in here?
- What?

15:51.742 --> 15:55.083
- Why did he give himself up?
- Because he's a psychopath.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.459
Yes. No. Maybe.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.166
But what he is doesn't matter.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.627
Why did he come in here?
Why did he give himself up?

16:00.710 --> 16:03.008
Why did he just tell us where the bomb is?

16:03.921 --> 16:06.015
He doesn't think we'll find it in time.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.222
And what, you think he's just
gonna show you where it is?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.225
Yes, but not from in here.
I need him on-site.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.807
He'll unconsciously give up more there

16:13.890 --> 16:15.853
- than he ever would here.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.773
What if he is just lying
to get out of here?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.356
You're right. He is by definition,

16:21.439 --> 16:23.736
but that doesn't mean a bomb
isn't about to go off.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.781
If we wanna stop him, we have to
let him think he's in control.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.364
And what if he is the one in control?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.750
He's not.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.873
Just let me do my thing.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.174
He's coming with.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.517
If this goes south, it's on you.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.707
Hey, in here!

18:01.372 --> 18:02.874
Exciting, isn't it?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.630
Oh, come on.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.424
You could be stuck at your desk
talking about the lousy weather

18:08.504 --> 18:10.843
or how the T-wolves are losing again

18:10.923 --> 18:13.642
or what poisonous fast food
you're going to pick up for lunch.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.687
Stuck in the same bullshit conversations

18:21.767 --> 18:27.319
with the same bullshit people
as every other day of your life.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.702
Nothing like a ticking bomb
to get the blood pumping.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.285
- Ever heard of a treadmill?
- Do I look like a hamster?

18:39.368 --> 18:41.996
Do you really want to waste
your precious energy

18:42.079 --> 18:44.377
spinning a wheel that goes nowhere?

18:54.342 --> 18:56.764
The bigger the crime,
the bigger the challenge.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.517
And everybody wants to beat the best.

18:59.597 --> 19:04.397
The faster your precious promotion,
your hollow pay-raise comes.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.479
What do you think?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.151
I think you talk too much.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.656
Hey, it's just my two cents.

19:18.407 --> 19:23.040
I wish you'd chose a different path 'cause
there was a fork in your road somewhere.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.668
You think you're walking
the righteous path, the right path,

19:25.748 --> 19:28.126
but you're not. Your map's all wrong.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.505
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

19:29.585 --> 19:32.589
but this path is just gonna
see you at the bottom of a grave.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.178
And how can you be so sure?

19:36.258 --> 19:38.260
Because I've seen others
walk it before you.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.683
Just my two cents.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.197
Road clear. Area has been evacuated.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.154
- Explosives team is on the way.
- On the way?

20:17.800 --> 20:18.801
Get the barrier!

20:20.678 --> 20:22.601
Move! Let's go, let's go!

21:06.891 --> 21:07.892
Four minutes.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.314
How do you wanna play it?

21:10.394 --> 21:13.318
Let's see your work
up close and personal, shall we?

21:19.487 --> 21:21.364
What are you doing?

21:21.447 --> 21:23.074
My job. What are you doing?

21:23.157 --> 21:24.620
You better not screw this up.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.873
I wasn't planning on it, but thank you.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.249
- What now?
- We walk.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.504
Then you take this.
Keep the receiver open.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.382
I wanna hear everything.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.974
You ever consider maybe
I'm not afraid to die?

21:45.846 --> 21:48.269
You think I'm just
going to tell you where it is?

21:48.349 --> 21:49.350
You already have.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.811
Here I am, an open book,

21:51.894 --> 21:56.524
all the information right there in front
of you, and still you need my help.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.821
You don't want this bomb
to go off any more than I do.

21:58.901 --> 22:02.030
- And why would that be?
- 'Cause you're not done yet.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.159
No.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.660
Who are these innocents to you?

22:07.743 --> 22:10.082
Do they really mean anything to you?

22:10.162 --> 22:13.792
But, more importantly,
do you mean anything to them?

22:13.874 --> 22:16.046
Do you think any one of them
would stop on the street

22:16.126 --> 22:18.049
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?

22:20.089 --> 22:23.639
No. You're not doing this for them.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.515
A town like these people,
you are far too intelligent

22:26.595 --> 22:28.559
to lie to yourself
about what you really are.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.142
You know the truth about yourself.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.022
What's that?

22:33.102 --> 22:35.275
You're having fun.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.283
Lucas.

22:44.655 --> 22:50.162
I am going to tell you the
truth about who I am and what I want.

22:50.244 --> 22:56.593
This whole goddamn nightmare of
a country is built on lies.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.673
Women with fake tits.

23:01.755 --> 23:05.054
All you see are reality shows,

23:05.134 --> 23:08.599
a leader who says he's going
to take care of people.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.977
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.480
All lies.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.689
What is the biggest lie of all?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.444
Everybody knows a house
is nothing without a neighborhood.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.072
Talk to us about
your mortgage options today.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.156
Live your dream. The American Dream.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.036
What is the biggest lie of all?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.993
The American Dream.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.957
Mortgage office.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.044
Mortgage office, let's go!

25:10.634 --> 25:13.098
- Guess you're a hero now, Lucas.
- Am I?

25:13.178 --> 25:15.225
You are if you believe in causality.

25:15.305 --> 25:19.229
Cause and effect, you fire a gun,
the bullet hits something or someone.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.562
You cross the wrong man,
he wants to kill you.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.693
You disarm a bomb, you become a hero.

25:27.901 --> 25:31.781
The thing about causality
is that it cuts both ways.

25:31.864 --> 25:37.246
Given a different effect, the same cause
can make a hero into a fool.

25:46.336 --> 25:49.010
Hey, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing? Hey, hey!

25:51.216 --> 25:53.435
Get down!

26:01.477 --> 26:03.070
Where did he go?

26:03.937 --> 26:05.314
Can you see him? Can you see him?

26:07.399 --> 26:08.616
Don't let him get away!

27:47.040 --> 27:48.712
Okay, okay!

27:48.792 --> 27:50.715
I'm out.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.684
Drop it.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.733
On your knees. Now!

28:09.813 --> 28:11.531
Okay.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.808
Nobody move!

29:24.888 --> 29:28.483
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hands up now! Hands up!

29:47.911 --> 29:51.835
We're training your mind, Lucas,
so you can do anything.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.087
Washington, Jefferson,
Buchanan, and Coolidge.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.044
Good.

29:56.128 --> 30:00.552
And now tell me, when you go
inside your memory house,

30:00.632 --> 30:02.760
is there anything more beautiful?

30:02.843 --> 30:06.642
Yes. A real house.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.894
Money isn't everything, Lucas.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.396
- God will provide...
- Well, can He buy us a house

30:11.476 --> 30:13.398
or a car or clothes?

30:13.478 --> 30:14.821
Because you can't.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.421
Dad, what did you do?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.840
Dad, it was my fault. I'm sorry.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.644
Why didn't you shoot him, Lucas?

31:36.436 --> 31:38.234
Because he has more bombs out there.

31:43.193 --> 31:46.116
- All right, Becky, what did he do?
- Not sure.

31:46.196 --> 31:50.746
- Whatever this is, it's encrypted.
- Well, if you had to guess.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.914
Well, this office is a data hub,

31:52.994 --> 31:55.042
so that means the servers
connect to bank alarm systems,

31:55.122 --> 31:56.460
to hospitals, to the airport.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.588
Might be information or a virus.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.840
I won't know until
I crack the code and pull it apart.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.134
Well, if it was a virus,
wouldn't the firewall stop it?

32:04.214 --> 32:06.178
He was already in the system.

32:06.258 --> 32:10.599
So you're telling us that
whatever he did can't be stopped?

32:10.679 --> 32:13.558
Yeah, short of unplugging everything
and causing a complete shutdown

32:13.640 --> 32:17.690
in our financial, health, security,
and transportation system? No.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.191
Get back to the office.
Do whatever you have to do.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.447
- Just crack it.
- On it.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.290
He's done.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.411
He's just starting.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.334
He's lived his entire life
for this moment. You understand that?

32:37.414 --> 32:42.170
What I understand is that we've done
exactly what he wanted us to do.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.800
I'm taking over this interrogation.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.176
Then you might as well
tell everybody to go home

32:46.256 --> 32:48.929
and start praying right now
because you're not gonna stop him.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.348
And you are?

32:51.428 --> 32:56.144
He has been toying with you since the minute
you walked into that interrogation room.

32:56.224 --> 32:59.689
Two hours, and we know
exactly nothing about him.

32:59.769 --> 33:03.399
Not his name, where he lives,
what he wants, what his next target is.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.612
You're missing the point.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.906
It's not who his name is or what he wants

33:07.986 --> 33:11.991
or even what he's gonna blow up next
because that is going to happen.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.956
Get him the hell out of here.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.135
Go home, Luke.

33:28.215 --> 33:31.560
Have a drink. We'll take it from here.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.556
Luke.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.407
Lucas.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.753
What the hell are you doing?

34:03.833 --> 34:05.797
- I know where he lives.
- You got an address?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.879
No, but I'll get you
within a quarter mile.

34:09.130 --> 34:14.181
- I'll bet my career on it.
- You just did. Well, let's go!

35:03.059 --> 35:06.107
No one in there is going to talk to you
with me looking like this.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.859
Come on, this is undignified.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.031
Yeah.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.785
Well, here's your dignity.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.996
Hey, friend, spare a dollar?

36:01.100 --> 36:02.414
Hey!

36:02.494 --> 36:05.122
- Bullshit.
- Hey, man.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.173
Special Agent Bennett.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.713
So?

36:09.793 --> 36:14.009
So... ass-face,

36:14.089 --> 36:17.053
I want you to tell me
if you have seen this man before.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.931
No.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.516
You sure about that?

36:24.599 --> 36:27.647
Someone not quite
so rosy white walks in here,

36:27.727 --> 36:29.065
I'm pretty sure you'd remember that.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.734
I'm sure.

36:30.814 --> 36:34.904
If that face showed up in here,
I'd remember.

36:34.984 --> 36:38.700
So whatever you assholes
came in here for, it ain't here,

36:38.780 --> 36:42.495
so why don't you do a little 180
and get the hell out of my bar?

36:42.575 --> 36:45.829
Unlike you, most people know
where they're not wanted.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.289
Mm.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.335
So what do you make of that?

36:51.418 --> 36:53.637
Looks like he was exactly
where he was wanted.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.182
Whoo!

37:11.646 --> 37:13.193
So you believe all this garbage?

37:13.273 --> 37:15.526
What, that whites are superior?

37:15.608 --> 37:18.077
Mm-hmm. Better.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.242
You know, I read a lot.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.870
Even disgusting crap like Mein Kampf.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.577
You know what I know for sure?

37:25.660 --> 37:28.459
Is that behind hate is fear.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.500
You're just a coward.

37:31.583 --> 37:37.261
Yeah, behind all this bravado,
you're just a scared little cunt.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.679
- Hey, don't move!
- Stay back!

37:40.759 --> 37:44.557
- Don't move!
- Sit down. Now.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.851
- Don't move.
- I know you've seen him.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.434
Fuck you!

37:49.517 --> 37:52.020
- Hey!
- Don't move.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.355
Sit down.

37:56.191 --> 37:59.614
What about you? Have you seen him?

37:59.694 --> 38:01.696
'Cause I've got all day
to bounce your head off this bar.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.534
Yeah, I've seen him a few times.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.038
Where does he live?

38:07.118 --> 38:10.458
- I know the dude. I don't fuck him.
- Why was he here?

38:10.538 --> 38:13.007
I'm guessing it wasn't for
the hospitality and hors d'oeuvres.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.257
- Freeze!
- Don't move.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.893
The feds, man! Heads up!

40:19.042 --> 40:20.339
Detonators.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.351
Thanks, man.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.943
Well, that was stupid.

40:39.094 --> 40:40.396
Probably.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.443
No, definitely.

40:42.523 --> 40:46.653
You should've waited for backup.
You're too smart to let it get personal.

40:46.736 --> 40:49.285
You get stupid again and you're out.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.076
The detonators are military grade.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.537
- Digital timers.
- Explosives?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.292
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

40:57.372 --> 41:00.587
This place is clean.
No explosives anywhere inside.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.463
You gotta give me
something better than that.

41:02.543 --> 41:06.009
Well, one of the detonator units
was missing from the box.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.387
- That's the best I got.
- Shit.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.763
I'm gonna go see if they know anything.

41:10.843 --> 41:11.969
Mm-hmm.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.639
They won't know anything more.

41:14.722 --> 41:18.226
He kept his bomb components separate
so only one can be compromised at a time.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.563
But he lives close.
I bet we'll find our explosives there.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.694
- How can you be sure?
- He has no ID, no driver's license.

41:24.774 --> 41:28.364
He doesn't come up on any CCTV matches,
so he doesn't take the bus or train.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.117
Too much surveillance.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.335
You keeping it together, Luke?

41:38.663 --> 41:41.462
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.466
'Cause you don't look fine.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.180
Come on, this is undignified.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.307
I've seen him a few times.

41:54.387 --> 41:55.639
Where does he live?

41:55.722 --> 41:58.019
Do you think any one of them
would stop on the street

41:58.099 --> 41:59.976
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.777
Unbelievable.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.493
No, I've never seen him before.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.041
What's he doing?

42:15.700 --> 42:18.670
Proving that no good deed goes unpunished.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.504
Oh, thanks.

42:28.796 --> 42:29.842
Yeah, he lives right around the corner...

42:29.922 --> 42:32.595
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.347
Prepare to move.
Follow where they're going.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.600
You're the boss. Let's go.

42:46.272 --> 42:47.569
Talk to me.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.989
Had one wallet, empty.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.783
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.

42:53.863 --> 42:56.491
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.326
"MS" was scratched into the key, right?

43:03.873 --> 43:05.546
Melissa Smith, apartment 34.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.423
Wait.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.842
He's smarter than this. He wanted us here.

43:10.922 --> 43:15.143
It's either part of the game
he has us playing or it's a trap.

43:17.386 --> 43:20.139
I want EOD at Jackson and Grant now.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.734
Yep, I got it.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.652
All right, just got a hit
on Melissa Smith.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.196
She's 35, clerical worker,
unmarried, no children.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.741
Facebook page says she
likes cats and Internet dating.

43:34.821 --> 43:36.949
No Social Security, no driver's license.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.619
It's an alias. She doesn't exist.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.039
Perfect alias. Wouldn't raise any flags.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.497
Okay, guys, this is taking too long.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.456
Almost there.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.542
We're all good. No booby traps.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.719
- We still need a warrant.
- Yeah, you get on that, Sara.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.167
What are they?

45:08.247 --> 45:12.753
Power grid. Water mains.
Gas lines. Internet.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.714
He's got a blueprint
to the entire city's infrastructure.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.676
Bring him up.

45:20.760 --> 45:24.230
- This is a crime scene.
- The real crime hasn't happened yet.

45:27.099 --> 45:28.316
Do it.

45:30.519 --> 45:31.566
Bring him up.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.088
What are you?

45:56.712 --> 45:58.214
Let's find out.

46:11.978 --> 46:14.606
Well, make yourselves at home.

46:14.689 --> 46:17.442
Uh, be careful with that, please.

46:19.527 --> 46:22.366
- Well?
- You're jerking me around.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.368
You're only starting to figure that out?

46:24.448 --> 46:26.325
But you led us here on purpose.

46:26.409 --> 46:30.124
Who says I led you anywhere?
You're calling the shots.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.081
What I do know is that
you want me to keep playing.

46:32.164 --> 46:34.629
You've already lost.

46:34.709 --> 46:38.589
Well, then you won't mind if I walk.
It's hard playing against yourself.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.926
Okay.

46:47.263 --> 46:50.142
I want you to keep playing.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.603
Then you're gonna have to make this
much more interesting.

47:00.943 --> 47:05.785
- What do you want?
- I want to change the world.

47:05.865 --> 47:08.334
Is that why you paint?
To change your world?

47:09.827 --> 47:10.998
The world's an ugly place.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.001
You wanna make it beautiful, so you paint?

47:20.755 --> 47:23.383
You need a blank canvas, am I right?

47:29.388 --> 47:35.314
Everything around us is fake, Lucas.
Why shouldn't I burn it down?

47:35.394 --> 47:37.738
You must've had a fucked-up childhood.

47:39.106 --> 47:43.111
To end up like this, living like this,
I mean, you got some serious issues.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.827
But we both know where they came from.

47:47.907 --> 47:50.626
Really? And where is that, Lucas?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.507
Women.

48:01.587 --> 48:04.090
Did some woman break your heart?

48:05.966 --> 48:07.388
Was it Mommy?

48:08.958 --> 48:11.008
She didn't love you enough?

48:11.097 --> 48:14.021
Whatever it is,
it's clear that you hate women.

48:15.226 --> 48:18.776
You think you know me.
You don't know shit.

48:21.107 --> 48:22.528
Just got a hit on Melissa Smith.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.322
It's an alias. She doesn't exist.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.115
She likes cats and Internet dating.

48:26.195 --> 48:28.284
...Internet dating.

48:28.364 --> 48:30.742
Internet dating...

48:36.163 --> 48:37.915
Wait, is that his laptop?

48:46.006 --> 48:48.259
Not surprising. He used private browsing.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.028
Nice hack. I see Becky's been
rubbing off on you a bit.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.197
We need to get her on the phone right now.

49:10.823 --> 49:13.788
- What's up?
- Beck, MNluvconnect.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.956
Run any woman he might've met
in the last six months

49:16.036 --> 49:19.165
against construction companies,
uh, demolition firms,

49:19.248 --> 49:22.422
commercial contractors, anyone you can
cross-reference with explosives.

49:24.837 --> 49:26.510
A password would be great.

49:30.134 --> 49:33.057
Seems to me like you have
two options, Lucas.

49:33.137 --> 49:36.016
You can get a warrant, or you can ask me.

49:36.098 --> 49:40.189
Not enough time for one,
too much pride for the other.

49:40.269 --> 49:43.648
Pity. You were doing so well.

49:51.113 --> 49:54.033
If we wanna stop him, we have
to let him think he's in control.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.086
Shit.

49:57.453 --> 49:59.125
Oh, now you've gone and done it.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.419
- The fuck did you do, hmm?
- Nothing.

50:01.499 --> 50:05.254
It was him. I'm sitting right here.
Fifty seconds and she blows, Lucas.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.633
- Stop it.
- Shoot me.

50:07.713 --> 50:09.802
- Throw it out the window.
- He can't do that.

50:09.882 --> 50:11.384
He knows the answer he needs is inside.

50:11.467 --> 50:15.433
He throws it out,
he has nothing, and I win.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.607
Tick-took, tick-tock, brother.

50:19.683 --> 50:22.186
Here I am, an open book

50:22.269 --> 50:25.022
with all the information
right there in front of you.

50:25.105 --> 50:27.858
"If a tree falls in the park
and there's no one to hear,

50:27.942 --> 50:31.242
it is silent, invisible, and nameless."

50:40.162 --> 50:42.256
- Philosophy.
- Do it.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.901
This is seriously messed up.

51:08.941 --> 51:11.945
And we are... in.

51:24.707 --> 51:25.708
Got ya.

51:32.006 --> 51:34.428
Yep. Thanks.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.972
- Joan Marian.
- And I care why?

51:37.052 --> 51:41.060
'Cause she's co-owner of Marian
Demolition, and their demo is explosives.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.729
Her name came up
on our boy's little sex site.

51:43.809 --> 51:46.148
- Where?
- Richmond.

51:46.228 --> 51:47.354
Let's go.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.113
Let's move!

53:02.304 --> 53:04.272
Hey, you can't go in there!

53:05.015 --> 53:08.269
Joan Marian? Special Agent Eric Bennett.

53:08.936 --> 53:10.107
What is this about?

53:10.187 --> 53:12.189
Oh, I think you have
a good idea what it's about.

53:18.112 --> 53:19.614
Oh, God.

53:21.782 --> 53:24.626
Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Mrs. Marian?

53:27.746 --> 53:33.547
Um... I'm unhappy in my marriage.

53:33.627 --> 53:36.050
I went on a dating website
and he pinged me,

53:36.130 --> 53:37.882
and so we went out on a date...

53:37.965 --> 53:41.060
I could give a shit about any of this.
Did he give you a name?

53:42.594 --> 53:45.063
Vasti. Vasti Radan.

53:46.265 --> 53:47.936
I'm on it.

53:48.016 --> 53:49.768
Oh, God.

53:52.438 --> 53:55.277
If I had known it was him,
I swear I would have turned him in.

53:55.357 --> 53:57.109
How much did he take?

53:59.862 --> 54:02.615
- A lot.
- Oh, Christ...

54:02.698 --> 54:04.120
Show us, please.

54:12.082 --> 54:13.925
It's like these drums here.

54:15.335 --> 54:16.427
Take him outside.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.598
Okay, so he stole two barrels off you.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.392
A little over a week ago.

54:26.472 --> 54:28.811
What kind? What's its application?

54:28.891 --> 54:30.437
- It's the powder form.
- Go ahead.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.064
It's highly conductive.

54:32.144 --> 54:34.772
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges

54:34.855 --> 54:36.983
or apply it to pretty much anything.

54:37.065 --> 54:39.113
Like what?

54:39.193 --> 54:42.241
Plaster, concrete, paper, paint even.

54:42.321 --> 54:46.787
We use it mainly to pour into drilled,
reinforced concrete supports,

54:46.867 --> 54:49.832
then let it dry for three days and then...

54:49.912 --> 54:52.756
- ...we detonate.
- Oh, Christ.

54:54.082 --> 54:55.459
Guys.

54:57.169 --> 54:58.546
Don't move.

55:03.425 --> 55:06.265
Vasti Radan. Very little on him.

55:06.345 --> 55:09.224
We did get a hit on his father,
a Magid Radan.

55:09.306 --> 55:12.146
Tax records show that he worked for
a private security agency

55:12.226 --> 55:14.103
called Simons Security.

55:14.186 --> 55:17.401
It's basic rent-a-cop
that contracts out to federal agencies.

55:17.481 --> 55:20.109
He was good for three years,
then he was found drunk on the job.

55:20.192 --> 55:23.532
Company fired him,
he lost everything and more.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.576
He was sued for unpaid debts.

55:25.656 --> 55:28.159
His home was foreclosed on.
He fell off the map.

55:28.242 --> 55:31.621
Two years later, he was found
dead in an alley in Chinatown.

55:31.703 --> 55:34.501
- So this is personal.
- Good.

55:34.581 --> 55:38.380
- How the hell is any of this good?
- That means his targets aren't random.

55:38.460 --> 55:43.051
There's a... a method behind them,
a logic pattern.

55:43.131 --> 55:45.554
But what pattern? That's the question.

55:45.634 --> 55:47.386
I'm not sure yet.

55:49.263 --> 55:51.436
All right, what do you wanna do?

55:53.183 --> 55:54.605
Ask him.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.241
Book her.

56:19.668 --> 56:21.295
Do you miss your dad?

56:22.713 --> 56:25.552
Hmm. She told you my name.

56:25.632 --> 56:29.473
Yep. You wanted her to.

56:29.553 --> 56:33.808
- And why would I do that?
- So I can figure out why you did it.

56:36.852 --> 56:41.733
What you want is locked up in here.

56:41.815 --> 56:44.068
I don't think you have the time...

56:46.153 --> 56:50.033
or the talents to unlock this vault.

56:50.490 --> 56:53.039
Seems a waste of water
to wash a car in the rain.

56:56.705 --> 56:59.378
Power grid, water mains, gas lines.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.007
He's got a blueprint to
the entire city's infrastructure.

57:06.548 --> 57:10.597
- Hey, Why'd you turn the water off?
- Water mains.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.556
Explosion reported. 935 5th Avenue.

57:18.477 --> 57:20.440
- He just hit the...
- The water department.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.522
And two substations.
They're shutting down the pumps.

57:22.606 --> 57:25.610
- All of them. And without water...
- The fire department can't fight fires.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.739
Eric, he is finished.

57:27.819 --> 57:30.197
Get him in the car. We're taking him
back to the federal building.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.701
What's it going to be, Lucas?

57:33.784 --> 57:35.286
- More talking?
- No.

57:35.369 --> 57:36.957
I've done enough of that. It's your turn.

57:37.037 --> 57:38.876
Tell me everything I know.

57:38.956 --> 57:40.833
You know my father was a drunk.

57:40.916 --> 57:43.755
He was fired from his job
and lost everything.

57:43.835 --> 57:46.133
And you know or should know or will know

57:46.213 --> 57:48.966
that my mother died six months after that.

57:49.049 --> 57:53.515
I lived on the streets and was forced
to fend for myself, educate myself.

57:53.595 --> 57:57.975
Everything I am today is because
of a system of people like you.

57:58.058 --> 58:02.482
You know that I have over a thousand pounds
of high explosives somewhere in the city

58:02.562 --> 58:04.526
and that I am not afraid to detonate them.

58:04.606 --> 58:08.071
But what you don't know
is where or really why.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.324
Now, you can take me
to Gitmo and torture me,

58:10.404 --> 58:12.492
but we both know that won't work.

58:12.572 --> 58:13.824
And you can even offer me money,

58:13.907 --> 58:16.877
but you know I would only laugh
in your smug face.

58:19.287 --> 58:22.961
Hey, hey, hey, come on!
Get him off! Get off!

58:23.041 --> 58:25.088
- Come on!
- Lucas! Lucas!

58:25.168 --> 58:26.590
Get him in the car.

58:26.670 --> 58:29.343
You take yourself so seriously.

58:29.423 --> 58:33.929
Go home. That's an order. Go.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.610
Got a wallet with some kind of
paint smudge on it.

58:46.690 --> 58:49.613
It's a powder form. Highly conductive.

58:49.693 --> 58:52.407
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges

58:52.487 --> 58:54.826
or apply it to pretty much anything.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.328
Like what?

58:56.408 --> 58:58.376
...paint even.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.584
Paint.

59:02.664 --> 59:04.086
Some kind of paint smudge on it.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.228
I gotta go.

59:21.308 --> 59:22.771
Hey, hey!

59:22.851 --> 59:24.774
It's okay, let him go.

59:30.859 --> 59:32.361
What are you doing here, Lucas?

59:32.444 --> 59:33.821
- Evidence.
- What?

59:33.904 --> 59:35.781
Vasti Radan's wallet. I need it.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.959
Lucas, you can't take that.

59:41.161 --> 59:42.458
I need an explosives test kit.

59:54.883 --> 59:56.226
There you are.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.349
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a minute.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.841
The paint. He mixed explosives with paint.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.297
- A building?
- Maybe.

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:32.340
There's over 200,000 in the city alone.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.259
It'll take months to check
every single one of them.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:35.716
We need to find out where he worked.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:36.887
It would have something
to do with painting.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:40.182
Commercial painting, uh,
I need you to find out where.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:42.100
There's no job records,
there's no EDD filings,

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.932
there's no tax records for a Vasti Radan.

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:45.729
- He used an alias.
- What alias?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.106
I need a name.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.314
Let's talk about books, then.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:54.071
"If a tree falls in the park
and there is no one to hear..."

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.494
William Fossett.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.745
A William Fossett
was terminated from his position

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:04.453
at a commercial painting company
after starting three days ago.

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:10.212
His employer, Bleaker Paint Works,

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:14.132
filed a charge for a trespass
and illegal entry into their warehouse.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.510
Seems like he stole some supplies.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.057
When the PD checked the address,
it didn't exist.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:24.390
I need his most job recent site, Beck.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:34.441
They were contracted to paint
the inside of the Federal Reserve Bank.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:38.449
- You did it, Lucas.
- I didn't.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.614
- Get Eric.
- Yeah.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.043
No answer. Shit.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:56.550
I was starting to think
you weren't going to make it.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.650
How are you holding up, buddy?

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.439
Wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing, Lucas?

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.694
- Solving a case.
- No, you're the case now.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.401
Bring him back, turn yourself in.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.111
- Can't do that, Eric.
- We talked to Becky.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.697
We know about the Federal Reserve.
EOD teams are en route now.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.032
They won't find it.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.703
- What are you talking about?
- The paint.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.785
It takes three days to dry.
He quit three days ago.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.541
He's gonna detonate it and he doesn't
think we can stop him in time.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:32.044
Hold on, hold on!

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.469
Shit.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.846
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.554
I'm gonna give him a choice:
life or death.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.851
You wanna take him inside?

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.853
About America. How unfair it is.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.646
So he wants to burn
the Federal Reserve to the ground.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.523
But I don't think he's willing
to die to make his point.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.823
- And if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.745
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.297
Stop backseat driving!

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.588
Maybe he's onto something.
He hasn't steered us wrong yet.

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.715
Yeah, well, he hasn't steered us
right yet either.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.298
Priority command,
Special Agent Lucas Nolan.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.970
He's heading to the Federal Reserve
with a suspected terrorist.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.643
I want them stopped.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.801
Freeze!

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.509
Put your hands up! Knees!

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.057
Now!

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.478
Put it down! Drop it!

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:14.980
- Drop it!
- You drop it!

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.482
Freeze! I'm FBI.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:21.692
- You put it down!
- I said drop it! Now! Now!

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.328
Kick it over.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.765
Get up.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.932
That was fun.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.360
Just act normal or I'll shoot you.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:50.658
Lucas Nolan, FBI.
I need to speak to someone in charge.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:53.491
Edward Watson, building facility manager.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.039
Everyone's cleared out
of the building now.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.917
Okay, good. Was the bank painted recently?

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.585
Uh, yes.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.542
How much of the bank
was painted, Mr. Watson?

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:05.754
Well, everything.
Over 200,000 square feet.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:09.091
- How much time do we have?
- Not enough.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:13.556
What you want is locked up in here.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:18.983
I don't think you have the time
or the talents to unlock this vault.

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:22.023
Did they paint the vault?

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:23.730
- Uh, yes.
- Take us there, please.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.281
Uh, this way.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:29.364
- Do you still have power?
- Uh, some.

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:32.033
Backup generator's enough
to run basic systems.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:34.160
- Surveillance cameras?
- Uh, no.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.414
Not until power's restored,
but that won't happen till 6:00 PM.

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:41.042
Check down there.

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.590
Down here.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.587
Tell me about the vault.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:51.845
Thirty feet of reinforced steel,
set 60 feet below street level.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:54.848
It's designed to be almost
impregnable from outside attack.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:56.680
So how much is in there?

01:06:57.555 --> 01:07:01.104
Twenty billion in coin and currency
come through here every year.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:05.314
Right now at the end of the month,
close to three billion.

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.444
Exterior doors are
electronically controlled.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.947
No getting in or out
unless the guard inside knows you.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:13.241
Watson, Edward.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:14.698
This way.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.452
Open it, please.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.097
Please. The currency
is surrounded by an electrical field.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.434
If you touch even a single bill,
full lockdown will occur.

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:49.779
No detonator.

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:52.906
God damn it, Lucas.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.908
Take your weapon out,
put it on the ground.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:57.702
- Now!
- The paint is the explosive.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.121
We gotta stop this.
It's gonna blow somehow.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.624
The detonator, it's in here.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.206
Check it out.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.298
Explosive is confirmed.

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.925
I'm not picking up a detonator.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.426
I'm not finding any detonators either.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.178
Okay, what else is in here besides money?

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:20.058
Plates and electronic currency
wiring stations in there.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:23.057
- What for?
- We can wire money anywhere in the world.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.562
All you need is an account number.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:27.020
Can you feel it, Lucas?

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:32.109
The energy is positively electric.
We're so close, I can taste it.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:35.069
Can you? No?

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:39.202
Maybe you should try harder.
How am I going to do it?

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:42.661
How am I going to detonate
all this explosive?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.919
I've given you the answer,
all the tells, everything you need.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:52.254
Now, impress me.
How am I going to get away with it?

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.135
Or am I?

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:57.675
You still have surveillance cameras?

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.096
No, not until power is restored.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.515
We heard that's gonna happen at 6:00 PM.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.269
6:00 PM.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.859
Eric, does your cell phone work?

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.072
No.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.575
Mr. Watson, do you have
a phone line to the outside?

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.247
Uh, there.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:34.129
- Hey.
- Do you have Joan Marian?

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.134
- She's in interview three.
- I need to talk to her.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.386
- Now?
- Yes, now. Right now.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:47.941
It's Lucas Nolan.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.064
- Yes?
- Mrs. Marian,

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.942
you said the explosives
were highly conductive.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.275
- Conductive of what?
- Electricity.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.947
That's how we detonate it.
We use electrical current.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.575
There's electrical current everywhere.
Why is it stable?

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:02.032
It's because of the differentials.

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.584
It responds to rapid
fluctuations in current.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.879
The building's the detonator.

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:14.297
It's gonna blow
when the power comes back on.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:18.301
We need to get out of here. Eric, now!

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.803
Okay, I was wrong about him.
I didn't understand.

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.260
I thought he cared about living.
He doesn't.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.846
In order for his plan to work,
he needs to die.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.100
Oh, Christ.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.103
Okay, this vault is gonna blow at 6:00.

01:10:29.842 --> 01:10:31.564
No, no, no.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:35.443
Shh. Well done. I must say I am impressed.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.320
- Let her go.
- Then they'll shoot me.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.653
- Fine, then take me.
- Why?

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.910
Because I'm willing to pay the price.
These people aren't. She's not.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:46.584
Okay. Walk towards me.

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.375
Slowly. Slowly.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.677
- Take the shot if you get it.
- Copy that.

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:04.595
Now the lesson is over. Now go.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.392
- We're not fucking moving anywhere.
- You need to get out of here now!

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:09.725
- Not without you.
- Eric, go!

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:14.274
Emergency. Vault shutdown.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:19.696
- Move! Out! Out now!
- I'm sorry.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.403
- I am so sorry.
- Go, go.

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.742
Eric, now!

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:26.699
- I'm not gonna fucking leave you here!
- Eric, go!

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:29.161
- Go! It's closing! Go!
- God damn it.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:32.789
God damn it!

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.093
- Hey.
- Becky, what did you hear?

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:44.637
The explosive is triggered
by electrical current fluctuations.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.264
Okay, get with
the power company right now.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.472
Tell them not to turn the power back on.

01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:51.519
That wasn't 2,000 pounds of anything.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.771
- Maybe he's alive.
- Open the door.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.690
- I can't.
- Open the goddamn door!

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:58.359
I can't! Nobody can.
Not until an hour after lockdown.

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:00.362
Oh, Jesus!

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.819
I need welders down here now.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.451
- Becky?
- I can't do anything. I'm on hold.

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:08.408
God damn it!

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.420
Please tell me he's gonna be all right.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.377
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.439
What the hell?

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:30.993
My computer just shut down.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.870
Same here. It's erasing the files.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.918
Damn it.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:39.919
What's happening, guys?

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:42.752
The virus, it's wiping the servers,
the backups, everything.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.712
Shit.

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:50.221
Four bombs and only two casualties.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:51.803
- It appears...
- Special Agent Lucas Nolan

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.976
is credited with saving the lives
of numerous federal agents and local...

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:58.104
Estimates put the paper losses
in the range of $3 billion,

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.687
- however, as the money never...
- FBI's Minneapolis office

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.316
experienced a cyber attack.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.360
Their secured servers
systematically erased all data,

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.910
including records involving
suspected bomber Vasti Radan.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:28.467
I'm honored to give the eulogy

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:31.300
for Lucas Nolan today.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.307
A colleague...

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:36.973
and a close friend.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:43.357
A man who came from literally nothing
to becoming the best behavioral analyst

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.815
I have ever worked with.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:50.197
A childhood of poverty,
a life on the streets,

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:54.452
and... and the ability to find courage

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.370
in the face of what happened to his father

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:59.795
was a testament to Lucas's
strong-willed mind.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:05.210
A mind that... that baffled us all.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.758
As we remember Lucas today,

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:13.218
let's hold him in our hearts

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.179
and remember him,
not just the colleague...

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.769
and not just a hero, because he was.

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.275
Let's remember a friend.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:30.076
God bless Lucas and Godspeed.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.540
Yep, that's quite the send-off.

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:43.668
Come on!

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.377
Get him!

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.508
Get off him now.

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:52.807
- I'm Lucas.
- I'm Vasti.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:08.531
You gonna put down my gun now?

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.900
Can I?

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.735
How do I know you're still with the plan?

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:15.616
It wasn't the easiest plan to follow,
but I stayed on point.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:17.118
Really?

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.161
That was some convincing shit, brother.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.706
Oh, you think so?
I thought maybe I went over the top.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:23.624
Are you kidding me? You had me
thinking you were one of them.

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:25.543
Well, what about that accent?
Where'd you pick that up?

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:26.875
I had five years to work on it.

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.004
And Why'd you come on
so hard in the fight?

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:31.007
- Dude, you shot at me.
- I shot near you.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.385
- Okay, whatever.
- We gotta get going. You ready?

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:36.179
Yeah.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:41.726
Here we go.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.149
Giddyup.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.506
That's a lot of zeros.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.636
- We good?
- Oh, we are so good.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:21.929
Let's go.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.317
- I hate tight spaces.
- You got this.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:39.366
Okay, this is the only
part of the plan I was not crazy about.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.035
- You okay?
- Yeah, I got this.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:42.536
How much time before
the water comes back on?

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.618
We got six minutes,
so we gotta book it. Let's go.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.796
- All right, ladies first.
- Yeah, suck it up, buttercup.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.962
You okay back there?

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:55.592
Yeah, aside from the 2,000 pounds
of high explosives on my ass.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:08.021
That means the water's coming.
We gotta haul ass!

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.199
Water's coming!

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:20.120
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:46.309
All right, man, we should get going.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.980
- One last stop.
- Yep.

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:21.925
Knight to queen four. Checkmate.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.817
I heard you were dead.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:40.151
Yeah. I heard that, too.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.579
Come on.

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:51.412
Planes waiting.
Fake passports cost me a fortune.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:54.248
Uh, is there any rush?

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.050
Not anymore.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:09.181
The terrorist responsible
and a hero perished in the attack.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:14.104
But today, we look forward knowing
that as a people we are unbowed.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:19.065
In other news, an anonymous donor has
pledged $100 million for the establishment

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.945
of scholarships and other services

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.744
for homeless children in and around
the Minneapolis area.

01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:30.621
So what drives a person to commit a crime?

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:35.209
I guess I'm that individual who found
the smallest chink in the system's armor

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:37.712
and benefited from it.

01:20:38.305 --> 01:20:44.281
