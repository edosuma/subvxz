WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:06.240
- BRIAN, I KNOW THAT YOU
LIKE GETTING POSITIVE FEEDBACK,

00:06.274 --> 00:07.675
AND YOU KNOW
THAT I HATE GIVING IT,

00:07.708 --> 00:09.510
SO THIS IS GONNA
BE A ONE-TIME THING.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.146
YOU HAVE REALLY BEEN
STEPPING UP YOUR GAME LATELY.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.416
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.219
- YOU OKAY, BUD?
- NOPE, NOT AT ALL.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.887
VOODOO STARTED
SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.055
- REALLY?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.723
- SOME DUDE NAMED DOUG.

00:22.756 --> 00:26.094
SHE MET HIM ON ONE
OF THOSE ASEXUAL MESSAGE BOARDS.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.596
- ASEXUAL MESSAGE BOARDS?
THAT SHIT EXISTS?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.564
- I MEAN, I KNEW LOGICALLY
THAT WE WEREN'T GONNA LAST,

00:30.598 --> 00:32.700
BUT IT JUST--IT STILL HURTS.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.868
THAT VOODOO PUT A SPELL ON ME.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.204
WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING?

00:36.237 --> 00:38.439
- OH, LEFT FIELD, ALL THE WAY.
OHH.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.174
- NOW I GOT TO CHANGE
HER RINGTONE.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.876
- DUDE, YOU'RE NOT DIVIDING
ASSETS IN A DIVORCE.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.578
YOU CAN KEEP THE RINGTONE.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.714
- IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.683
YOU'RE STILL FRIENDS.
YOU'RE STILL NOT HAVING SEX.

00:49.717 --> 00:53.020
- YEAH, BUT I'M NOT THE PERSON
SHE'S NOT HAVING SEX WITH.

00:53.053 --> 00:57.625
SHE'S OUT THERE NOT HAVING SEX
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.794
NOT NOT ME, NOT HIM.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.396
- BRIAN, YOU'VE REALLY GOT
IT PRETTY GOOD HERE.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.897
- YES.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.566
- I MEAN, THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT A BREAKUP

01:05.599 --> 01:07.635
IS IMAGINING YOUR EX
GETTING IT ON WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.104
- YES, IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY
THING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.305
- YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT

01:11.339 --> 01:12.873
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW
THE ANSWER.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.575
- COME ON. YEAH.
- SHE'S HAVING SEX WITH NO ONE.

01:14.608 --> 01:15.643
- NOBODY!

01:15.676 --> 01:18.112
- EVER.
- EVER.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.148
- EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.316
I CALLED HER LAST NIGHT TO SEE
IF SHE WANTED TO SEE A MOVIE.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.817
SHE HAD ALREADY SEEN IT
WITH DOUG.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.453
- [sighs]

01:25.486 --> 01:27.087
- SHE KNOWS THAT NIC CAGE DRAMAS
ARE OUR THING.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.122
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.990
THAT IS WAY WORSE THAN IMAGINING

01:30.023 --> 01:33.827
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE SWEATILY
ENTANGLED WITH ANOTHER MAN

01:33.861 --> 01:37.598
MAKING WET SPOTS ON SILK SHEETS
ILLUMINATED BY SEX CANDLES.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.333
- SEX CANDLES?
- YEAH, SEX CANDLES.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.568
- IS THAT A--IS THAT A THING?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.136
SHOULD I BE BUYING
SEX CANDLES NOW?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.772
- LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.275
YES.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.017
IF YOU WALKED IN
ON YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER

SAW THEM WALKING ON THE BEACH,

02:01.322 --> 02:02.790
HOLDING HANDS,

02:02.823 --> 02:06.327
CLEARLY AND DEEPLY IN LOVE?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.761
- IS THAT A REAL QUESTION?
SEX.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.298
- ALWAYS SEX.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.832
- WELL, GUYS,

02:46.267 --> 02:48.302
THERE'S NO PATIENT.
- WHY'D YOU CALL US?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.837
- WE HAD A BET TO SEE
WHO WOULD GET HERE FIRST,

02:49.870 --> 02:51.339
AN AMBULANCE OR THE PIZZA GUY.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.140

- YOU CALLED IN A FAKE EMERGENCY
AS PART OF A BET?

02:56.277 --> 02:58.479
- A FAKE MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YES.

02:58.512 --> 03:03.183
FAKE PIZZA EMERGENCY, NO,
'CAUSE WE ARE HUNGRY AS SHIT.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.152

CALLING AN AMBULANCE IS A JOKE?

- NO. NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT,
UM...

03:14.862 --> 03:16.764
OFFICERS, OR--
- WE MEAN NO HARM.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.731
- WHAT WE DO CAN MEAN
THE DIFFERENCE

03:17.765 --> 03:19.199
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.168
SHIT LIKE THIS
NOT ONLY WASTES OUR TIME,

03:32.280 --> 03:37.084
- 5 HUNDO FOR THE TROUBLE.

ON THE MONEY, JOHN.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.395

IT'S PROPERLY INVESTED.

INHERITED IT FROM GRANDFATHER.

HE ONLY LIVES THERE
BECAUSE HE THINKS

04:22.996 --> 04:24.264
THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S GONNA HIT.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.232
HE WANTS TO BRAG
THAT HE LIVED THERE

04:25.265 --> 04:26.834
WHEN POOR PEOPLE STILL DID.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.002
SIT AROUND ALL DAY
NOT DOING ANYTHING,

04:29.036 --> 04:30.504
TRYING TO RENAME
THE NEIGHBORHOOD "NONOWEWE."

04:30.538 --> 04:31.839
- WHAT?

04:31.872 --> 04:32.806
- NORTH OF NORTH,
WEST OF WESTERN.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.808
DUDE'S AN IDIOT.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.410
HE'S ONE OF THESE MORONS
WHO'S ALWAYS ON A NEW CLEANSE,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.078
WHO DECIDES HE'S ONLY
GONNA LISTEN TO JAZZ

04:40.814 --> 04:42.650
TELL ME HE DOESN'T HAVE
ONE OF THOSE FACES

04:42.683 --> 04:44.785
YOU JUST WANT TO BOUNCE OFF
THE HOOD OF YOUR CAR, YOU KNOW?

04:44.818 --> 04:45.986
[laughs]

04:46.019 --> 04:46.987
YOU KNOW?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.292
NO.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.462
- WHAT?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.029
- NO.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.866
- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.868
- OH, YOU'RE BONING MY LANDLORD.
- I AM.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.770
- OH, NO.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.138
NO. SERIOUSLY?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.341
DUDE, YOU WEREN'T GONNA
SAY ANYTHING TO ME?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.642
- NO, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA BE

05:08.676 --> 05:10.310
A TOTAL DICK ABOUT IT.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.312
BESIDES, YOU GOT THIS IRRATIONAL
HATRED OF RICH GUYS.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.147
- NOT ALL RICH GUYS,
JUST RICH WHITE GUYS.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.283
- OH, SEE, THAT'S RACIST.
- WHAT? HOW?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.818
- YOU SHOULD HATE
RICH BLACK PEOPLE

05:17.851 --> 05:19.387
JUST AS MUCH
AS YOU HATE RICH WHITE PEOPLE.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.288
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE SMUG ASSHOLES

05:21.321 --> 05:22.990
WHO HAVE HAD EVERYTHING
HANDED TO THEM IN LIFE.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.492
- OH, SO NOW
THERE ARE NO SMUG BLACK PEOPLE

05:24.525 --> 05:26.193
WHO DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORK HARD FOR IT?

05:26.226 --> 05:27.461
- MAYBE THERE ARE.
THEY'RE JUST NOT AS ANNOYING.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.696
- JADEN SMITH.
- ONE GUY.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.564
- WILLOW SMITH.
- OKAY, TWO.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.500
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M
THE ONE PUTTING THIS OUT THERE,

05:32.533 --> 05:35.403
BUT WHAT ABOUT 200 YEARS
OF SLAVERY, MAN?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.670
DOESN'T THAT BUY YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.639
- IT WAS 400,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.974
AND THAT SHOULDN'T PREVENT ME
FROM HATING JADEN SMITH.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.743
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT OBAMA'S KIDS ARE A PROBLEM,

05:42.776 --> 05:44.044
'CAUSE THEY SEEM REALLY COOL,

05:44.077 --> 05:45.513
BUT YOU KNOW
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE,

05:45.546 --> 05:47.347
EITHER THEIR KIDS
OR THEIR KIDS' KIDS

05:47.381 --> 05:49.483
WHO ARE ALL GONNA BE RICH,
SOMEWHERE IN THERE,

05:49.517 --> 05:52.853
ONE OF THEM, PRESTON OBAMA,
IS GONNA BE A TOTAL DICK,

05:52.886 --> 05:54.488
AND I WANT THE FREEDOM
TO HATE THE LIVING SHIT

05:54.522 --> 05:55.656
OUT OF HIM.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.257
- PRESTON OBAMA.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.258
- HE DOES KIND OF
SOUND LIKE KIND OF A JERK.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.260
- MM-HMM.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.195
- HANK, I'M PUTTING AN ORIGINAL
PAIR OF JORDAN 3s ON ETSY

06:02.229 --> 06:03.897

'CAUSE ONCE THEY

06:05.098 --> 06:06.867
GO LIVE, SAYONARA.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.035
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT HANK ANYMORE,

06:08.068 --> 06:09.737
'CAUSE HE'S DATING A RICH GUY.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.505
HE CAN GET JORDAN 3s ANYTIME
HIS PRETTY LITTLE HEAD

06:11.539 --> 06:13.273
WANTS A PAIR.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.543
- I AM SEEING SOMEONE
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE SOME MONEY,

06:15.576 --> 06:16.944
AND APPARENTLY THAT'S A CRIME
IN THE EYES

06:16.977 --> 06:18.045
OF A CRAZY PERSON WE KNOW.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.413
- YOU GOT A SUGAR DADDY?

06:19.447 --> 06:23.517
- NO, DUDE'S WAY YOUNGER
THAN HANK,

06:23.551 --> 06:25.118
MORE OF A SUGAR BABY.
- MM-HMM.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.554
BABY, BABY, BABY.
YOU CRAZY.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.255
- YEAH, WELL, HOW OLD IS HE?

06:28.288 --> 06:29.757
- HE'S NOT WAY YOUNGER THAN ME.
- WAY YOUNGER.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.058
- SHUT UP.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.894
- HEY, BRIAN, WAIT A SEC.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.063
UM, I HEARD ABOUT YOU
AND VOODOO.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.098
- YEAH.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.901
- IF I'M BEING COMPLETELY
HONEST, I THINK IT'S GREAT.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.203
- YOUR GLASS
IS ALWAYS HALF FULL, HUH?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.972
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.139
- ASK ME ON A DATE.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.975
I'LL SHOW YOU.
- A DATE?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.710
- YEAH.
I THINK IT'D BE FUN.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.378
- THANKS, GABBY, BUT I JUST--

06:51.411 --> 06:52.780
I JUST DON'T THINK
I'D BE AT MY BEST.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.548
I'M KIND OF IN A MOURNING PHASE.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.717
RULE OF THUMB IS YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MOURN ONE WEEK

06:56.750 --> 06:58.218
FOR EVERY MONTH
YOU WERE TOGETHER,

06:58.251 --> 07:00.888
WHICH BY MY MATH
PUTS ME AT 12 DAYS.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.924
IT'S MORE THAN THE SUGGESTED
AMOUNT, BUT I KNOW MY BODY.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.559
- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET
SOMEONE ELSE GET

07:05.593 --> 07:08.161
TO KNOW YOUR BODY.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.131
- WAIT, I'M--I'M NOT SURE
WHAT I HIGH-FIVED RIGHT THERE.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.600
I'M JUST THAT KIND OF GUY.
I SEE A HIGH FIVE,

07:12.633 --> 07:13.834
AND I TAKE IT.
- [laughs]

07:13.867 --> 07:15.402
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.938
SEE YOU IN 12 DAYS.

07:17.971 --> 07:18.939

07:18.972 --> 07:20.941

07:23.010 --> 07:23.877
- [whispers] WOW.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.820
[indistinct chatter]

07:32.853 --> 07:34.755
- OH, HEY.
both: HEY.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.025
- HEY. HEY.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.027
- CRAZY, HUH?
- MM.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.695
- YEAH, CRAZY.
- [sighs]

07:41.729 --> 07:44.765
- SO CRAZY.
- [chuckles]

07:44.798 --> 07:46.600
- HUH.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.536
- WELL...
- SO...

07:48.569 --> 07:50.203
- HEY, WELL,
WE GOT A BUNCH OF CHINESE FOOD

07:50.237 --> 07:52.005
IF YOU WANT TO COME ON UP
AND HAVE SOME.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.141
- OH, I CAN'T.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.175
I'M ON A CLEANSE.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.645
- COURSE YOU ARE.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.313
[Johnny and Theresa chuckle]

08:00.347 --> 08:01.549
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.517
- OKAY.
- YES, YOU WILL.

08:03.551 --> 08:07.120
- OH, HEY, UH, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT GETTING SOME CHICKENS.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.522
- HMM? THE BIRD?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.290
- YEAH, IN THE BACKYARD.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.059
- YEAH, IN THE--OH.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.028
- HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE
TO HAVE FRESH EGGS EVERY DAY?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.130
- SO GREAT.
- SO GREAT, RIGHT?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.999
- SO GREAT.
- [chuckles]

08:22.002 --> 08:23.537
[distant thuds]

08:23.571 --> 08:26.006
- THAT WAS THE KITCHEN.
- [sighs]

08:26.039 --> 08:28.141
JUST IGNORE IT.
HE KNOWS WE CAN HEAR HIM.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.811
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO IGNORE
420 POUNDS OF MAN BEEF

08:30.844 --> 08:32.079
GOING AT EACH OTHER?

08:32.112 --> 08:35.716
[creaking]

08:35.749 --> 08:37.317
- NOW, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.318
I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT'S THE FIREPLACE.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.087
- [laughs]

08:40.120 --> 08:41.188
- RAN OUT OF REAL ESTATE,
DIDN'T YOU, BUDDY?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.823
- OH, BE HAPPY FOR HIM.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.692
- HANK IS JUST A FLAVOR
OF THE WEEK FOR THIS GUY,

08:44.725 --> 08:46.026
LIKE INDONESIAN SHALLOTS

08:46.059 --> 08:47.494
AND THAT WEIRD BRAZILIAN
DANCE-FIGHTING

08:47.527 --> 08:49.329
HE WAS INTO LAST WEEK,
AND NOW CHICKENS?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.898
I MEAN, THIS GUY JUST TAKES
ONE BITE OUT OF EVERYTHING.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.399
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIS TRASH?

08:52.432 --> 08:53.433
- YOU LOOKED
THROUGH THIS GUY'S TRASH?

08:53.466 --> 08:54.735
- NO, I CAME UPON HIS TRASH.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.570
- MM-HMM.
- HE LEFT THE LID OFF.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.705
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE EXPECTED
SOMEONE TO CLOSE IT FOR HIM.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.740
- DID YOU?
- YEAH.

08:59.773 --> 09:00.674
YEAH, I DID, 'CAUSE THIS CITY
HAS A TERRIBLE RAT PROBLEM.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.175
- OH.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.076
- SOMETHING HE
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND

09:03.110 --> 09:04.177
IN HIS IVORY SEX CASTLE.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.613
[knock on door]
- [laughs]

09:05.646 --> 09:08.749
- WHEW.
I NEED THE GATORADE.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.350
- JESUS.
- OH.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.720
[whistling]
WAS IT AS FUN AS IT SOUNDED?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.387
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.889
- YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF,
YOU REALIZE THAT?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.891
- [laughs]

09:17.925 --> 09:19.359
WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR WRIST?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.461
- OH,
IT'S A TAG HEUER AQUARACER 5.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.963
- OH.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.364
- MM, IT REALLY IS.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.266
STAINLESS STEEL,
SWISS QUARTZ MOVEMENT,

09:26.299 --> 09:28.468
WATER RESISTANT UP
TO 300 METERS.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.738
- YOU DON'T SWIM.
- I BATHE.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.439
AND HE'S GOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,
DEEP, STONE TUB.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.407
I ALMOST DROWNED.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.043
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A NAME
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.377
YOU'RE BEING A GOLD DIGGER.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.746
- TECHNICALLY,
I DID NOT DIG FOR THIS,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.580
AND IT'S STAINLESS STEEL.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.582
BESIDES, I'D RATHER BE
A GOLD DIGGER THAN A RACIST.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.217
- OH, OH, HERE WE GO.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.086
- WHO'S A RACIST?
- YOUR BOYFRIEND.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.588
HE HATES RICH WHITE PEOPLE MORE
THAN HE HATES RICH BLACK PEOPLE.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.223
- THAT'S NOT RACIST.
- IT'S KIND OF RACIST, BABE.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.759
- [chuckles]

09:51.792 --> 09:54.828
- HEY, HANK,
NICK IS ONE OF THE NICEST GUYS

09:54.862 --> 09:57.597
THAT I HAVE MET
SINCE WE MOVED INTO NONOWEWE.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.999
- DON'T CALL IT THAT.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.600
- THANK YOU.
ROUND TWO.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.469
- OH.
- HAVE FUN.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.107
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
- HEY, BUDDY.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.508
- HEY.
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

10:08.541 --> 10:09.777
- NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT ME?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.111
SOMETHING IN THIS REGION?

10:11.144 --> 10:12.445
- UM...

10:12.479 --> 10:16.183
- DOES THIS GET YOU THERE?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.618
HEALED.
MY 12 DAYS OF MOURNING ARE UP,

10:18.652 --> 10:21.121
AND THE OLD BRIAN IS BACK
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.656
- YOO!
DRINKS ON BRI.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.291
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.694
YES, I'M PUTTING DOWN
THE DISCOVER CARD.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.830
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE OLD BRIAN WAS BACK, HUH?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.331
- [laughing]

10:31.364 --> 10:34.101
I'M READY TO LAUGH AGAIN.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.268
VOODOO AND DOUG
AREN'T HERE YET, HUH?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.137
- NO.
- WHY?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.339
- I GOT A HANDSHAKE FOR THAT GUY
THAT'S LONG OVERDUE.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.809
- HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
ON A BRAVE FACE FOR ME, BRO.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.943
I WANT THE REAL STUFF.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.012
I THRIVE ON IT.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.048
- VOODOO WILL ALWAYS HOLD
A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART,

10:48.081 --> 10:49.616
BUT I'M READY TO BE HAPPY
FOR HER.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.218
I EVEN RETIRED HER OLD RINGTONE.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.987
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THE NEW ONE?
- MM-HMM.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.825
- [scatting]
* FRIENDS

10:57.858 --> 10:59.492
- IS THAT MILES DAVIS?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.128
- NO, IT'S ME.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.295
I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT FOR HER.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.363
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.632
all: HEY.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.400
- THIS IS DOUG.
- HI, EVERYONE.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.568
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.837
- OKAY.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.404
- WHERE'S BRIAN?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.240
- UH, I THINK HE FREAKED OUT
A LITTLE BIT

11:13.273 --> 11:15.575
AND IS PROBABLY HYPERVENTILATING
OVER BY THE BAR.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.710
I'LL CHECK ON HIM IN A SECOND.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.611
- I'VE GOT THIS ONE, BRO.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.651
- [breathing heavily]

11:24.684 --> 11:28.221
- YO, DEEP BREATH, MAN,
DEEP BREATH.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.557
- MY--MY CHEST, IT'S SO TIGHT.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.025
- I KNOW, I'VE BEEN THERE, MAN.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.561
I'VE BEEN THERE.
WELL, NOT THERE, THERE.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.997
THAT DUDE NEVER TOOK MY GIRL.
I GUESS IN THE SITUATION

11:37.030 --> 11:38.899
I'M TALKING ABOUT I WAS
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE DOUG,

11:38.932 --> 11:40.768
BUT, MAN, I'M TELLING YOU, BRO.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.104
THE BRIAN IN THAT SCENARIO
WAS SAD.

11:44.137 --> 11:48.008
THAT DUDE LEFT ME
SOME SAD MESSAGES, OKAY?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.910
I GOT TO PLAY THEM FOR YOU
SOMETIME.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.413
THEY'RE BANANAS, YO.
- THANKS, BUDDY.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.049
- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO,
WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO,

11:56.083 --> 11:57.751
THAT'S WHAT WE GONNA DO.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.787
THAT'S WHERE WE GONNA GO.
- OKAY.

12:01.588 --> 12:05.192
[applause]

12:05.225 --> 12:08.228
MAGIC IS THE ONE THING THAT LETS
ME FORGET ALL MY PROBLEMS.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.630
- SO WHAT?
IT, LIKE, MAKES THEM DISAPPEAR?

12:10.663 --> 12:12.565
[laughing]

12:12.599 --> 12:14.401
- AND THAT, MY FRIEND, IS
THE GREATEST TRICK OF THEM ALL.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.236
- SHH.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.571
- SORRY, BRO.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.973
OH, MY GOD, A BUNNY.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.976
I LOVE LITTLE BUNNIES.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.812
THIS WIZARD IS AWESOME.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.980
- HE GOES
BY XANDER THE OUTLANDER,

12:27.014 --> 12:28.715
BUT HIS REAL NAME IS ROSS.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.750
HE EMPLOYS A CLASSICAL TECHNIQUE

12:30.784 --> 12:33.620
CLEARLY INFLUENCED
BY COPPERFIELD, WHO HIMSELF

12:33.653 --> 12:35.588
WAS JUST A WATERED-DOWN VERSION
OF THE TRUE GREATS.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.824
- SHH.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.992
YOU'RE RUINING THE SHOW.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.330
- I'M MORE OF A RICKY JAY

12:43.363 --> 12:45.632
OR AMAZING JOHNATHAN GUY
MYSELF.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.468
THOSE GUYS USE STORYTELLING
AS PART OF THE ACT,

12:48.501 --> 12:51.738
WHICH I THINK EXPONENTIALLY
BOOSTS THE ELEMENT OF WONDER.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.606
- I WONDER
IF YOU'RE EVER GONNA SHUT UP.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.909
- MAN, COME ON.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.644
MY BOY HERE'S HAVING
A PRETTY ROUGH DAY,

12:57.677 --> 13:00.013
SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CALM DOWN
A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

13:00.047 --> 13:01.581
- IT'S OKAY, BILLY.
I'M FEELING BETTER.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.983
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
HEAD OUT, HUH?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.184
- NO WAY, MAN, YOU'RE CRAZY.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.919
AND MISS THE FINALE?
MM-MM.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.487
THIS DUDE'S COOKING UP
SOMETHING DELICIOUS.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.655
- I'M GETTING SECURITY.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.523
- THAT--THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.591
- AND NOW IF I COULD HAVE
A VOLUNTEER FROM THE AUDIENCE?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.426
- LET'S GO.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.928
- HERE IS OUR BRAVE VOLUNTEER.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.129
- OH, SHIT!

13:26.139 --> 13:29.109
- WHAT'S UP, NICK?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.678
- HANK DUMPED ME.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.646
- SERIOUSLY?

13:33.680 --> 13:36.149
- ONE MINUTE, EVERYTHING
IS GOING GREAT, AND THE NEXT,

13:36.183 --> 13:40.153
HE SAYS THE RELATIONSHIP
HAS RUN ITS COURSE.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.956
- OH, THAT'S ROUGH.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.292
BUT DUDES, RIGHT?
[chuckles]

13:45.325 --> 13:47.060
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.530
- YOU GOT TO HELP ME, JOHNNY.
- [sighs]

13:50.563 --> 13:52.032
IS THAT A PITCHER
OF MARGARITAS?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.066
- IT'S CAIPIRINHAS.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.667
I CAME INTO SOME MINT.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.069
LISTEN, MAYBE
IF YOU TALK TO HANK FOR ME--

13:56.103 --> 13:57.304
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.239
- TELL HIM
HOW MUCH I NEED HIM.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.874
- THAT'S VERY AWKWARD FOR ME.
- HOW MUCH HE MEANS TO ME.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.642
- I CAN'T EMPHASIZE
THE AWKWARDNESS ENOUGH.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.178
- I'LL COVER YOUR RENT.
- WHAT'S THAT?

14:05.212 --> 14:10.350
- IF YOU TALK TO HANK FOR ME,
I GOT YOUR RENT THIS MONTH.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.685
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.154
HEY, HEY, HEY.

14:14.187 --> 14:18.225
HEY, UM...

14:18.258 --> 14:21.161
YOU'RE--YOU'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HANK ST. CLARE.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.063
NO, YOU ARE.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.531
- YOU THINK?
- YEAH.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.166
YOU'RE THE REAL CATCH HERE,
RIGHT?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.935
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YEAH, YOU ARE.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.869
YOU'RE YOUNG AND HANDSOME,

14:29.903 --> 14:32.172
AND YOU GOT...

14:32.205 --> 14:35.775
EQUITY AND SHIT.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.444
YOU'LL SEE.
- DON'T GO!

14:37.477 --> 14:39.412
- OKAY.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.017
- PLEASE?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.919
- RENT AND HBO?

14:45.953 --> 14:49.022
- AND SHOWTIME.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.023
- NONOWEWE?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.925
- NONOWEWE.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.397
- NONOWEWE.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.068
- IF YOU WOULD?

15:05.505 --> 15:07.807
YOU NEED TO BE VERY, VERY STILL.
YOU GOT IT?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.242
- OH, I KNOW THE DRILL.
- YOU SURE?

15:09.276 --> 15:10.944
- ROSS, I CAME HERE
ON MY 23RD BIRTHDAY.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.312
WE DID THIS EXACT TRICK.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.981
IT KILLED, BY THE WAY,
STANDING O.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.682
I'M FINE.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.623
- STEEL...

15:23.656 --> 15:27.460
DOES NOT CARE IF YOU ARE MAN...

15:31.331 --> 15:32.299
[audience gasps]

15:32.332 --> 15:34.067
OR WOMAN.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.003
IT RESPECTS...

15:40.140 --> 15:42.842
ONLY STEEL.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.578
- [scats]

15:45.612 --> 15:47.480
* FRIENDS

15:49.649 --> 15:52.485
- ITS ONLY SUSTENANCE...

15:54.787 --> 15:59.359
- NO WAY.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.428
- FLESH.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.031
- OW!
- OOH.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.137
- HOW YOU HOLDING UP, HOUDINI?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.671
- HEY, GABBY.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.673
YOU HEARD, HUH?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.275
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.643
- WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF YOU WENT

16:16.676 --> 16:18.345
TO THAT MAGIC SHOW WITH ME.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.113
I'D NEVER LET ANYONE HURT YOU.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.149
AND IF THEY DID,
I'D MAKE THEM PAY.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.217
- [chuckles]
I BELIEVE YOU.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.187
- SO YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.788
- YEAH, YEAH.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.390
IT'S A--IT'S JUST A BIG SCRATCH.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.059
- [laughs]
I CAN READ A CHART.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.127
I MEANT
WITH YOUR MOURNING PERIOD.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.230
STILL ON IT?
- OH, THAT.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.232
IT--YEAH, IT'S TECHNICALLY OVER,

16:39.266 --> 16:43.070
BUT I HAD A BIT OF A SETBACK.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.639
SO THE TRUTH IS,
I'M NOT SURE WHEN I'LL BE READY.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.908
- FAIR ENOUGH.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.910
WELL, LET'S GET YOU CHECKED OUT.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.917
YOU CAN FEEL THAT, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.353
YEAH, I CAN--I CAN FEEL THAT.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.755
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.891
ANY PAIN?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.693
- [sighs]

17:06.726 --> 17:10.497
THERE'S A--
THERE'S A LITTLE TWINGE THERE.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.101
- OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO STRETCH IT OUT LIKE THIS.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.951
- OH, OKAY.
AH.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.286
- OH!
- NOPE, NO, ROLL WITH IT.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.722
IT'S FINE. GO AHEAD...
- OKAY.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.424
- NOBODY'S GONNA WALK IN, RIGHT?

17:37.457 --> 17:40.560
- MM, MAYBE.
- OKAY.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.928
- GABBY THE NURSE?
- GABBY THE NURSE?

17:41.961 --> 17:44.231
- OH!
COME ON, HOW'D IT GO DOWN?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.632
- DEETS, DEETS, SPILL.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.600
- A GENTLEMAN DOES NOT KISS
AND TELL,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.736
BUT KNOW THAT IT WAS NICE.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.438
- OH.
- OOH, NICE.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.805
COME ON.
- NICE.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.107
YOU GONNA SEE THIS NICE GIRL
AGAIN?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.242
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.743
WE'RE TAKING IT SLOW.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.611
UH, FAST BUT SLOW.
- YEAH.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.313
- I'M HOLDING OFF ON GIVING HER
A RINGTONE THOUGH.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.914
[laughter]

18:01.948 --> 18:05.318
- A RINGTONE.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.620
DOES NICK HAVE A RINGTONE?
- OH, SURE DOES.

18:07.654 --> 18:08.921
SAME ONE I GIVE ALL MY EXES:

18:08.955 --> 18:11.424
DO NOT ANSWER.
- OH.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.092
- AMBULANCE NEEDED, AMALFI
MOTORS, CLARK AND WRIGHTWOOD.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.162
- AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.497
- BUT IT'S--IT'S NOT,
LIKE, OVER, OVER, IS IT?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.432
- OH, IT IS.
- WHY?

18:19.466 --> 18:20.900
- FIRST OF ALL,
HE WOULDN'T BUY GATORADE.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.336
SECONDLY, NONOWEWE?
COME ON.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.272
I MEAN,
HE WAS RICH AND GOOD-LOOKING,

18:25.305 --> 18:27.807
BUT HE TALKED
ABOUT SUCH DUMB SHIT.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.510
I STARTED TO DREAD EVERY TIME
HE OPENED HIS MOUTH.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.680
WELL, NOT EVERY TIME
HE OPENED HIS MOUTH.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.583
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN HE--
- YUP.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.084
- WHAT--IT'S A REFERENCE TO--
- YUP, YUP, YUP, YUP, YUP.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.018
- YOU KNOW.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.292
- PROTOCOL SAYS
WE SHOULD TAKE YOU IN,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.859
BUT WE CAN'T FORCE YOU.

18:46.893 --> 18:47.827
- YOU KNOW,
I'M FEELING ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

18:47.860 --> 18:49.095
AND I'M SHORTHANDED TODAY,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.029
AND I GOT
SOME HIGH-END CUSTOMERS

18:50.062 --> 18:51.698
THAT CAN BE REAL ASSHOLES.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.132
- YOU HAVE TO SIGN A WAIVER.
- THAT'S FINE.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.601
- BRIAN?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.537
- THIS WAY, SIR.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.607
- HEY, YOU KNOW, UM,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.041
I WAS THINKING,

19:02.074 --> 19:05.111
NICK'S ACTUALLY NOT A--
NOT A BAD DUDE.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.347
I MEAN, HE'S GOT
SUCH AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.049
- HOW MUCH IS HE PAYING YOU?
- WHAT?

19:10.082 --> 19:11.784
- HOW MUCH MONEY
IS HE PAYING YOU?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.852
- NOTHING.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.388
- HOW MUCH, JOHN?

19:15.422 --> 19:18.291
- HE WAS CRYING, MAN,
REAL TEARS.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.959
HE WAS, LIKE, BEGGING.
HE WAS SAD.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.694
I MEAN, HE REALLY LIKES YOU.
- HOW MUCH MONEY?

19:21.728 --> 19:23.896
- A MONTH'S RENT PLUS FREE HBO.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.665
- NO SHOWTIME?
- AND SHOWTIME.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.335
- NO.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.469
YOU AIN'T GETTING SHIT,
'CAUSE I AIN'T CALLING HIM.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.371
- HEY, I TOLD HIM

19:31.404 --> 19:32.905
THAT I WOULD SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU, AND I SAID SOMETHING.

19:32.939 --> 19:33.840
I GET FREE RENT AND CABLE
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.041
- FINE.
- FINE.

19:35.074 --> 19:35.975
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- GOOD FOR ME.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.746
- MM-HMM.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.249
- IT'S JUST, LOOK. I KNOW
I SAID SOME SHIT ABOUT THIS GUY,

19:42.282 --> 19:44.651
BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY MORE
ABOUT ME THAN IT WAS ABOUT HIM,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.153
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M GONNA BE COOL

19:47.186 --> 19:51.023
WITH WHOEVER YOU CHOOSE
TO DRINK GATORADE WITH.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.425
- OH, SCREW THAT.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.060
IF I'M DATING A DOUCHEBAG,

19:54.093 --> 19:55.528
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
I'M DATING A DOUCHEBAG.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.196
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU WERE DATING A DOUCHEBAG.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.767
- I KNOW, BUT HE WAS SO CUTE
AND HAD SUCH NICE SHIT.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.902
- [laughing] OHH.
- OOH.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.605
- [chuckles]

20:05.638 --> 20:09.942
- YO, TAKE EXTRA SPECIAL CARE
OF MY BABY.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.844
- OH, I'M NOT--
- GET IT DONE BY 6:00.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.548
THERE'LL BE SOMETHING
IN IT FOR YOU, CHIEF.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.916
- [laughing]

20:16.949 --> 20:18.017
- UNBELIEVABLE.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.886
I AM SICK OF THESE RICH ASSHOLES

20:19.919 --> 20:21.588
THINKING EVERYBODY IN A BLUE
UNIFORM DOES THE SAME THING.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.590
I MEAN, HOW DOES THIS GUY
MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY,

20:23.623 --> 20:25.892
AND HE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A MECHANIC AND AN EMT?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.193
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.194
- DO YOU SEE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.596
- WHAT?

20:29.629 --> 20:30.763
- YOU ALMOST WENT HAM
ON THAT GUY.

20:30.797 --> 20:31.898
- YEAH, HE'S AN ASSHOLE.
SO WHAT?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.099
- A BLACK ASSHOLE.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.635
YOU JUST HATED A RICH BLACK GUY

20:35.668 --> 20:40.540
AS MUCH
AS YOU HATE RICH WHITE GUYS.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
- I DID, DIDN'T I?
- THAT'S GROWTH.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.777
- YEAH.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.078
WHY DID HE THROW YOU THE KEYS
INSTEAD OF ME?

20:46.112 --> 20:48.147
- HUH?
- WHAT, HE JUST AUTOMATICALLY

20:48.180 --> 20:50.082
ASSUMES THE WHITE DUDE
IS THE HEAD MECHANIC?

20:50.116 --> 20:51.551
THAT'S SOME BULLSHIT.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.952
YOU KNOW WE GOT
A BLACK PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

20:52.985 --> 20:54.787
HEY, GIVE ME THEM KEYS.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.489
I'MA KEY HIS CAR RIGHT NOW.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.157
- WELL, AS THE HEAD MECHANIC,

20:58.190 --> 21:00.927
I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.729
- HAND ME THEM KEYS, JOHN.
- [laughs]

21:02.762 --> 21:03.963
- GIVE ME THEM KEYS.
- IT JUST WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.264
IT'S OUT OF MY PURVIEW.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.566
- YOUR PURVIEW?
- YEAH, MY PURVIEW.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.600
- JOHN FARRELL,
DO YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE?

21:07.634 --> 21:09.168
YOU BETTER GIVE ME THE KEYS.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.603
YOU BETTER GIVE ME--
WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?
