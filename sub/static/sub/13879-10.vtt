00:46.188 --> 00:48.348
Hey, what's going on here, ah?

00:48.383 --> 00:49.967
You're looking at it, tubs.

00:51.255 --> 00:52.188
It's on.

00:52.190 --> 00:56.759
Anybody here want to go, uh,
see a serious rock show?

00:56.858 --> 00:58.224
Get your face melted off?

00:58.226 --> 01:01.260
Blow your hair to the
back of the auditorium?

01:01.266 --> 01:03.834
You want to be seen
with us in public?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.955
- Are you paying for it?
- I'm giving you a deal.

01:06.006 --> 01:07.873
40 bucks a pop. That is a steal.

01:07.964 --> 01:10.731
Oh, okay. No, thank you, then.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.065
How about $12? That's face value.

01:13.067 --> 01:14.833
I-I can't do no better than that.

01:14.835 --> 01:17.302
Sorry, Carl.
As you can see, we're booked.

01:17.363 --> 01:20.853
- You ain't even heard what this is yet.
- What is it?

01:21.434 --> 01:26.403
The world's greatest east german
metal band... Totem Pole.

01:26.744 --> 01:29.979
This is their "Trapped Inside Alive" tour.

01:31.616 --> 01:33.249
Yeah, no, thank you.

01:33.252 --> 01:36.489
They've been behind the iron
curtain for way too long.

01:36.580 --> 01:40.581
Finally, the pole is
brought stateside tonight!

01:41.463 --> 01:44.364
All right. Have a
good time, man.

01:44.366 --> 01:46.799
- 8 bucks a pop. How about that?
- No.

01:46.971 --> 01:48.805
- 4 bucks. Come on!
- Nope.

01:48.846 --> 01:51.814
I'm gonna eat 95 tickets
if you don't buy these!

01:51.875 --> 01:56.173
- 95 tickets?
- There was a 96-ticket limit online.

01:56.298 --> 01:58.531
Figured I could flip 'em at the show.

01:58.932 --> 02:02.001
I may have overestimated
demand for Totem Pole.

02:02.037 --> 02:04.471
You can sell them, Carl.
You're a good salesman.

02:04.489 --> 02:06.422
I'm hooked, and I don't
even know what it is.

02:06.444 --> 02:09.244
Fine. Free! Merry [bleep] Christmas!

02:09.264 --> 02:11.699
'Cause you got a free Totem
pole show out of this!

02:11.784 --> 02:14.482
You know that ad that says the
best things in life are free?

02:14.767 --> 02:17.438
I believe it, and that's
why I want to go.

02:17.440 --> 02:21.509
Yeah, me too. I'm the demographic
for free, because I'm unemployable.

02:21.521 --> 02:23.555
What does this Totem Pole sing?

02:23.559 --> 02:28.792
A lot of songs about forming human Totem
poles and shoving heads up asses.

02:28.820 --> 02:30.533
Yeah, they're way into that.

02:30.598 --> 02:36.263
Check it out... "Poles On Patrol,"
"Poles & Souls," "Poleorite,"

02:36.340 --> 02:38.374
"Glory Pole"... that's the seminal album.

02:38.471 --> 02:40.205
That's the desert-island disc.

02:40.282 --> 02:43.316
"Poleing Place"... they got
very political in that one.

02:43.368 --> 02:45.969
"For Whom the Bell Poles"... classic.

02:46.028 --> 02:47.627
"Polegasm"... classic.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.922
"How Many Poles to Screw In the Bulb?"...
another classic.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.128
"Polenight," "Not Polite To Say

02:53.139 --> 02:56.241
No To Polenight"... that's their
first English-speaking album.

02:56.271 --> 03:00.439
"Ringthrust"... that's a double
album, and it also marks the

03:00.457 --> 03:03.371
first time they didn't use the word
"pole" in their album titles.

03:03.373 --> 03:04.806
Who's that weirdo at the top?

03:04.897 --> 03:06.930
Seems to be a recurring motif.

03:06.946 --> 03:09.880
That's Lenny the Troll.
He's their mascot.

03:09.922 --> 03:11.990
That's who they're talking
about when they sing, "Summon

03:12.032 --> 03:15.938
the Troll to sit on the pole and
lift up the pole," and then solo.

03:19.085 --> 03:22.653
Yeah, you know, Carl... I think
I'm coming down with something, man.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.863
Are you out of your mind? They're
recording a live album tonight!

03:25.942 --> 03:28.208
We can get obnoxious
and get on the record.

03:28.220 --> 03:31.477
"Loving It Live in Poladelphia".

03:31.997 --> 03:32.829
Poladelphia?

03:32.846 --> 03:36.278
Yeah, the Philly show got canceled,
so they're recording it here!

03:36.281 --> 03:38.982
At the high-school gymnasium!

03:39.072 --> 03:41.163
Shh! Shh! Shut up! Listen!

03:41.708 --> 03:45.009
♪ Young lady and lass,
enter the ass ♪

03:45.149 --> 03:47.917
♪ Open the ring, and
the anus shall sing ♪

03:48.006 --> 03:49.105
Yeah, I hate to miss it.

03:49.152 --> 03:50.592
Meatwad, get that
out of my butt!

03:50.594 --> 03:54.171
98.6. You seem to
feel fine to me.

03:54.173 --> 03:55.774
Sorry, Carl, but we'll
take a rain check.

03:55.805 --> 03:56.704
That's cool.

03:56.733 --> 03:58.885
When you're feeling better,
we'll do the D.C. show.

03:58.954 --> 04:02.579
'Cause I'm following them all
the way down the coast, baby!

04:03.037 --> 04:04.789
Yeah, fun.

04:08.266 --> 04:10.758
I just love this music, you know?
It speaks to me.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.427
In what language, exactly?

04:12.925 --> 04:15.228
God, this place is gonna
get packed to the gills.

04:15.230 --> 04:18.351
Way cool to see all these other
people into what I'm into.

04:18.353 --> 04:19.779
And yet none of them are women.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.781
You said it was gonna
be crawling with trim.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.192
Tonight ain't about whores.

04:23.194 --> 04:26.362
I still plan to get some, but
when you get in the Totem Pole

04:26.426 --> 04:28.376
zone, it's like
nothing else matters.

04:28.461 --> 04:36.183
You hear the klaxon that summons
the Troll... clong, clong, clong.

04:36.185 --> 04:37.818
You'll feel it up your spine.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.412
Is that there the Troll?

04:39.511 --> 04:41.712
That's Lenny. Uh, don't...
don't look over there.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.824
Wow, he looks even
smaller in person.

04:43.845 --> 04:45.311
We ought to talk to him...
Well, maybe not.

04:45.371 --> 04:48.687
I don't want to bother him before the show.
Lenny!! Lenny!

04:48.809 --> 04:51.008
- Did he look over?
- He's looking at us, Carl.

04:51.010 --> 04:53.084
- Hey, Lenny.
- Sorry! It was him!

04:53.086 --> 04:56.271
He did that! You don't talk
to Lenny unless spoken to!

04:56.683 --> 04:57.650
Wait, hang on, no.

04:57.652 --> 05:00.886
Buy me a baseball Jersey, bumper
sticker, and fridge magnet.

05:00.904 --> 05:03.031
- Get them all signed.
- The lights are going down.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.566
Meatman, where you going?

05:04.625 --> 05:06.818
I'm going home. I'm
afraid of the dark.

05:10.225 --> 05:13.461
The legend has it in their
albums that when they form

05:13.526 --> 05:16.585
the pole, it's an antenna
to the underworld.

05:16.587 --> 05:20.254
So, the skeletons will rise
and America will learn.

05:20.261 --> 05:22.189
- What will they learn?
- I don't know.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.756
That is to be revealed
on future albums.

05:24.982 --> 05:26.681
Raise the pole!

05:26.688 --> 05:27.899
Raise the pole!

05:32.261 --> 05:35.176
Okay, I'm gonna up of the stage.
You catch me, all right?

05:35.178 --> 05:36.329
Okay.

05:37.156 --> 05:39.590
Oh, what a hell?
I told you to catch me!

05:39.613 --> 05:41.742
- I tried.
- All right, look.

05:41.744 --> 05:45.293
I'm gonna go up there again.
But next time, you catch me!

05:45.457 --> 05:48.209
We're gonna summon
the Troll, yeah!

05:48.247 --> 05:49.435
Hey! Wait!

05:49.467 --> 05:52.234
Wait! No! No! Don't!

05:52.321 --> 05:54.756
Don't! Please, don't! Don't!

05:55.916 --> 05:58.915
Carl, all right! You
summoned the Troll, man!

05:58.917 --> 05:59.816
I can't breathe!

05:59.899 --> 06:00.899
I can't breathe!

06:00.928 --> 06:05.510
Wait, hang on. We'd like to ask you,
please stop punching the Troll.

06:05.512 --> 06:07.917
We only have four
trolls for this tour.

06:07.919 --> 06:10.486
They are very expensive.
They hards to trap.

06:10.495 --> 06:14.627
And if we damage this one, we'll only have
three left, and two of them are sick.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.923
Sorry.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.982
Okay, let's pick it up at
"Who Will Light the Fire."

06:27.340 --> 06:30.772
Hey, check it out, Carl!
I got a backstage laminate.

06:31.645 --> 06:33.945
Hey, people really
cleared out of here.

06:34.180 --> 06:35.447
What's going on down there?

06:35.517 --> 06:36.916
Oh, that's never gonna fit!

06:37.006 --> 06:37.937
He's too big!

06:37.939 --> 06:38.671
He's too big!

06:42.716 --> 06:47.358
It fits! Skeletons,
rise, my children!

06:50.664 --> 06:52.731
Oh [bleep] skeletons!

06:52.794 --> 06:55.228
Get the wristbands, the
bandanas and the t-shirts!

06:55.306 --> 06:57.606
- Help me deflate the zeppelin!
- Mario, get the amps!

06:57.615 --> 06:59.449
Why'd the music stop?
What's going on?

06:59.454 --> 07:01.921
I'm hoping it's the fire
marshal shutting it down!

07:01.923 --> 07:04.221
Come on! They only
played one song!

07:04.223 --> 07:05.522
Someone grab the Troll!

07:08.025 --> 07:10.359
I can't get him off.
It's like he's glued.

07:10.427 --> 07:13.304
- We'll find another troll in D.C.!
- They're Swedish trolls!

07:13.323 --> 07:15.257
Let's ship one overnight.
Hurry up! Lets go!

07:15.333 --> 07:17.500
Hang on! Wait! No! No!
Don't go away! Stop!

07:17.818 --> 07:21.353
- Can I get a picture with you?
- Oh, man, yeah, sure. Quickly.

07:21.417 --> 07:24.210
Shake, get my camera out of my ass.
Hand it to the Troll.

07:24.212 --> 07:26.572
- Ohh, ow!
- Here it is!

07:30.218 --> 07:32.551
How's it look? We got
time for another one?

07:32.610 --> 07:34.377
Got to go, guy.
Thanks for coming.

07:34.379 --> 07:36.399
See you guys in D.C.!
Totem Pole rules!

07:40.430 --> 07:42.298
How we gonna get home, Carl?

07:42.383 --> 07:45.580
I can drive. I only had
like... uh, eight beers.

07:45.634 --> 07:49.136
- Yeah, but can you see?
- Not what I want to see.

07:49.199 --> 07:50.799
We better call a cab.

07:50.876 --> 07:53.998
Grab my cellphone out of my ass
and pass it up to the Troll.

07:54.679 --> 07:56.518
Aah! Ohh, oh, okay.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.021
I'm holding it out
with my right hand.

08:00.549 --> 08:01.793
Reach!

08:03.115 --> 08:04.244
To your right.

08:05.874 --> 08:07.758
There you go. You got it.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.394
Hey, Lenny! The cab's
on speed dial.

08:10.438 --> 08:14.202
Ask for a van with a luggage rack and
tell him to bring bungee cords.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.375
I think we may have
to ride up top.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:25.499 --> 08:29.124
Lenny, what's it like
working with the band?

08:29.126 --> 08:32.385
Is helment as cool as he seemed
like on the album covers?

08:39.764 --> 08:43.001
Not a lot of oxygen inside this troll.
You know what I mean?

08:43.674 --> 08:45.288
Whew.

08:47.063 --> 08:49.506
- Who, me?
- You might as well sit down.

08:49.508 --> 08:53.506
We're gonna be here awhile. Skeletons
have the place surrounded.

08:55.715 --> 08:57.774
So, where you guys
headed next, huh?

08:58.085 --> 08:59.145
D.C.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.341
If we get there.

09:03.406 --> 09:05.574
Oh, yeah, I knew that. You
know, I shouldn't have asked

09:05.635 --> 09:08.235
it 'cause I read about it on the
blog, I got tickets for that

09:08.250 --> 09:10.640
show, and you guys
are so awesome.

09:13.918 --> 09:17.446
You must score so much
tail in this band.

09:19.474 --> 09:22.075
- So, what do you do?
- I'm between opportunities.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.062
Look, I don't mean to
be disrespectful, here.

09:24.141 --> 09:26.201
I'm just getting a little
claustrophobic, you know?

09:26.203 --> 09:27.302
Please don't fight it.

09:27.348 --> 09:30.139
the Troll gets energy from
you through his butt.

09:30.141 --> 09:33.634
If you fight too hard, he'll clench
and shear your head right off.

09:33.636 --> 09:36.904
Just pass out, and he will
evacuate you from his bowels.

09:36.990 --> 09:39.556
He'll get bored with you.
You're not very interesting.

09:42.380 --> 09:46.595
I heard about that show in Belgium.
I mean, 23 headless corpses?

09:46.613 --> 09:48.246
- 27.
- Geez.

09:48.267 --> 09:50.667
Yeah, we had to fire that troll.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.157
Wow.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.095
Oh, man, I just remembered
we have a live in-studio

09:56.104 --> 09:58.004
performance at K-rock
in Washington.

09:58.055 --> 10:01.156
Washington D.C.'s only home
for east german metal?

10:01.260 --> 10:03.097
- What time?
- 4:00 in the morning.

10:04.142 --> 10:05.675
- Get the guns!
- What about the Troll?

10:05.767 --> 10:07.718
Leave the Troll! We got to go!

10:13.702 --> 10:15.332
- No!
- Oh, man.

10:16.981 --> 10:18.982
You know, I didn't even
think you guys would play

10:18.990 --> 10:22.250
"Polegasm" anymore, but
you freaking led with it.

10:22.252 --> 10:24.815
Ahh, awesome show, dudes!

10:24.854 --> 10:27.524
- They're gone, Carl.
- I'm hearing footsteps.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.537
- Little clickity-clackity, you know?
- Yeah, I hear it, too.

10:30.811 --> 10:32.297
It's like tap shoes, right?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.471
Hey, have you heard any
demos of the new stuff?

10:34.979 --> 10:36.951
- Who, me?
- No, the Troll.

10:37.487 --> 10:40.756
Have you heard any demos?!
He don't speak English.

10:41.249 --> 10:44.559
Ohh! Ohh. Oh, thank God.

10:46.811 --> 10:49.847
Carl, ask the band where they're
partying late night, you know?

10:49.912 --> 10:51.667
- Maybe we can hook up with them?
- Shut up.
