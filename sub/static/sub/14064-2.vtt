00:02.065 --> 00:04.502
Previous on Boston Legal.

00:04.602 --> 00:06.629
The media has painted me
as the "Black Widow"...

00:06.738 --> 00:09.073
the gold digger who's poisoned
her 70-year-old rich husband.

00:09.173 --> 00:11.609
- I am not an evil person.
- Yes, you are, Bernie!

00:11.709 --> 00:14.112
You've killed two people
inside of a week.

00:14.212 --> 00:16.547
By definition, that makes you evil.

00:16.648 --> 00:19.050
Would you let me take you to church?

00:19.150 --> 00:21.087
Opposing counsel
is someone I used to date.

00:21.186 --> 00:22.917
- I thought I told you.
- I think you didn't.

00:23.023 --> 00:27.692
Somebody killed him, Kelly.
Accidental overdose will be very hard to sell.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.698
The capsule was emptied
into the wine glass.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.132
- Who takes nitro that way?
- I didn't kill my husband.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.135
Dream case, isn't it? High profile.

00:35.235 --> 00:38.469
Splashy. Big closing.
Get the not guilty. "

00:38.572 --> 00:40.940
Have sex with the client.
It's all there.

00:57.592 --> 01:01.623
Basically, she looks as unemotional as ever,
almost calcified.

01:01.731 --> 01:05.135
No doubt she's calcified,
Bobby. I mean, come on.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.400
- She's a cold-blooded killer.
- I'd give anything to be in on this case.

01:08.504 --> 01:11.135
- Why don't you just show up and start objecting?
- Funny.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.110
...who takes Viagra. Trust me,
I have been with a bunch.

01:14.210 --> 01:16.271
First thing the doctor says is,
"Don't take nitro. "

01:16.379 --> 01:19.250
And these weren't
nitro tablets, by the way.

01:19.349 --> 01:21.945
They were capsules-

01:22.053 --> 01:25.857
opened up and poured into
the wine to avoid detection.

01:25.957 --> 01:28.086
Does she think we all
just fell offal turnip truck?

01:29.894 --> 01:33.025
First offal, when I got to the scene
of the crime, she was completely calm.

01:33.131 --> 01:36.866
Her expression was cold,
blank, detached.

01:36.969 --> 01:39.634
- Did she say anything?
- She said it was his heart.

01:39.738 --> 01:42.369
Then she offered that he was having
chest pains earlier.

01:42.475 --> 01:47.349
It was as if she was tying tasters to
natural causes- perhaps to head off an autopsy.

01:47.446 --> 01:49.006
- Objection.
- Sustained.

01:49.116 --> 01:53.352
Later, when we confronted her
with the toxicology reports...

01:53.453 --> 01:55.355
she just went silent.

01:55.455 --> 01:58.689
We asked her if anyone had a motive
to kill her husband. She coldly responded...

01:58.792 --> 02:01.320
that she was through
answering our questions.

02:01.428 --> 02:03.729
How long have you been
a detective, sir?

02:03.831 --> 02:06.997
- Twenty-two years.
- Ever talk to someone whose spouse just died?

02:07.101 --> 02:09.971
- Of course.
- Ever know such a person to be in shock?

02:10.072 --> 02:13.910
- Of course.
- Is it possible one manifestation of shock is a blank expression?

02:14.009 --> 02:17.038
- I suppose.
- Did you investigate the possibility...

02:17.146 --> 02:20.984
- that anybody else killed Joel Nolan?
- We ruled everybody out but her.

02:21.083 --> 02:25.024
I'm sorry, maybe I missed it. Is there any
reference in your notes to other suspects?

02:25.121 --> 02:28.822
- No.
- Did you mention to anyone that you considered other suspects?

02:28.925 --> 02:31.726
- No.
- Did you investigate suicide?

02:33.296 --> 02:35.698
We ruled out suicide.

02:35.798 --> 02:38.429
- There's a cop who'll never make captain.
- Mr. Crane!

02:38.535 --> 02:40.563
Approach, please.

02:46.844 --> 02:50.249
I have instructed Mr. Shore,
I will so instruct you...

02:50.347 --> 02:53.080
not to make comments
to undermine my courtroom.

02:53.185 --> 02:56.716
Mr. Shore has bought himself jail sentence
at the conclusion of this trial.

02:56.821 --> 03:00.090
I'd have no compunction
about assigning him a bunkmate.

03:00.193 --> 03:04.692
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I have, uh, mad cow disease.

03:05.998 --> 03:09.369
I think you do too. Look at his eye.

03:11.370 --> 03:14.308
Your Honor.

04:15.539 --> 04:19.503
Did I say "quiet"? Maybe I was referring
to the nightcap in my place later.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.613
Malcolm, what are we doing here?

04:24.716 --> 04:29.853
That man onstage is my client
and he asked me to come here.

04:32.492 --> 04:34.553
They won’t let me sing
"War;' that's why.

04:34.661 --> 04:37.964
It's my trademark song.
I'm Edwin Starr.

04:38.065 --> 04:40.535
Well, technically, Johnny, you're not.
Edwin Starr is dead.

04:40.634 --> 04:44.438
But I'm his nephew. I've inherited
the rights to his library and likeness.

04:44.538 --> 04:47.874
For stage purposes, I'm him,
and what is Edwin Starr without "War"?

04:47.975 --> 04:50.412
- Why won’t the let you sing it?
- They consider it anti-American.

04:50.511 --> 04:54.850
And it's not just here. I'm getting it
in Cleveland, in Detroit, Bakersneld.

04:54.949 --> 04:56.578
It's starting' to happen eve here.

05:01.856 --> 05:05.125
You hear that?
They're singing it themselves.

05:05.227 --> 05:08.667
They still think I'm coming' out to do it
as an encore. Huh!

05:08.764 --> 05:11.167
And when I don't,
they're going to go home disappointed.

05:18.775 --> 05:23.717
Got her little outfit on. Hair all
bleach-blonde, just the way she likes it.

05:23.814 --> 05:29.383
I am telling' you, folks, none of this
will be worth a hill of beans in the end.

05:29.486 --> 05:32.550
- Denise.
- This joy is not stupid. It's smart.

05:32.657 --> 05:34.752
- She is as guilt-
- Tim.

05:34.859 --> 05:38.960
Hey, listen. I think you remember
Reverend Diddum- at least, hearing about him.

05:39.064 --> 05:41.968
- Hello, Denise.
- Hi.

05:42.067 --> 05:45.096
Well, it turns out, the reverend
is also a lawyer, and, well...

05:45.204 --> 05:48.040
I've decided to let him
handle my divorce.

05:48.141 --> 05:51.477
You're being represented
by a minister?

05:51.577 --> 05:55.985
I just thought, in the spirit of resolving this
as humanely and civilly as possible...

05:56.082 --> 05:58.952
it just make sense
to put things, you know-

05:59.052 --> 06:02.787
As I looked at the numbers, fortunately,
it works out rather cleanly.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.657
- May I?
- Please.

06:05.760 --> 06:10.259
You currently make
$320, OOO perineum.

06:10.365 --> 06:13.826
Out of love and charity of heart...

06:13.934 --> 06:16.964
you have graciously
and steadfastly supported Tim...

06:17.072 --> 06:19.065
in his quest to make
the P. G. A. tour.

06:19.174 --> 06:23.673
Statistically, however-
Let us pray.

06:23.779 --> 06:26.615
Dear God, please continue
to bless this man...

06:26.715 --> 06:31.487
with the courage to persevere
in the face of these enormous odds.

06:31.587 --> 06:34.423
Amen. Statistically,
at 34-year-old's...

06:34.524 --> 06:37.758
prospects of making the tour
look bleak.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.331
Assuming you were to continue
paying spousal support...

06:40.431 --> 06:43.700
as you are required to do by law-
I speak now of alimony.

06:43.801 --> 06:45.794
Taking into account inflation...

06:45.903 --> 06:49.843
your continued job growth-
successful person that you are-

06:49.940 --> 06:53.938
it would cost you over two and a half
million dollars over the next 1 O years.

06:54.045 --> 06:56.846
That's a present-day value
of890, OOO.

06:56.948 --> 07:01.013
Tim, with reciprocal
charity of heart...

07:01.120 --> 07:06.621
is willing to discount that to 625,
conditioned upon an up-front payout today.

07:06.725 --> 07:09.287
Although we would entertain
structuring it over...

07:09.396 --> 07:12.300
four months, if you prefer.

07:14.367 --> 07:18.171
You want me to pay you $625, OOO.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.708
Anaya, think on it. Pray on it.

07:20.807 --> 07:24.406
Look to your advisers
as well as your conscience...

07:24.511 --> 07:26.845
then we can talk again.

07:51.341 --> 07:54.541
What do you mean she's
co counseling with him?

07:54.643 --> 07:57.548
Evidently, it's some case
concerning commercial censorship.

07:57.647 --> 07:59.674
Why he needs Tara, I don't know.

07:59.782 --> 08:03.347
- He doesn't need her. He wants her.
- I beg your pardon?

08:03.454 --> 08:05.948
If you have been supporting him
this entire time, there's-

08:06.056 --> 08:07.958
I'm supporting him as a golf bum.

08:08.058 --> 08:10.324
Even so, under the law,
his alimony would be determined-

08:10.428 --> 08:12.330
I want to change the law.

08:12.430 --> 08:14.332
- You want to change the law?
- Yes!

08:14.432 --> 08:16.732
If the law says
by financing his "bum hood"...

08:16.835 --> 08:19.237
I am therefore required
to do so in perpetuity...

08:19.337 --> 08:21.239
the law needs changing.

08:21.339 --> 08:24.608
Sara, I need a memo challenging
the constitutionality of no-fault divorce.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.804
I'll need it by the end of business.

08:28.014 --> 08:30.211
Why are you looking' to Garrett?

08:30.316 --> 08:33.447
If thought Garrett had the answers,
I would look to Garrett.

08:33.554 --> 08:37.722
Instead, I look to you.
End of business. Hmm?

08:37.823 --> 08:42.892
Find me adjudge who got screwed
over in his divorce settlement.

08:42.996 --> 08:45.559
They're out there. Go.

08:45.666 --> 08:49.127
Memo!

08:53.241 --> 08:56.111
He threatened to leave her
and he was screaming at her...

08:56.210 --> 08:58.443
"You're out of the will!
You're out of the will!"

08:58.547 --> 09:00.642
- Two days later, she killed him.
- Objection!

09:00.748 --> 09:03.914
Sustained. The last remark
is stricken.

09:04.019 --> 09:07.925
Miss Stadler, could you describe the
defendant's relationship with the decedent?

09:08.023 --> 09:10.859
It wasn't good. He was
increasingly angry over her affair.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.830
Calling your attention to the evening
of December 13 this past year...

09:13.929 --> 09:18.667
did you have opportunity to hear a conversation
between the defendant and her boyfriend...

09:18.768 --> 09:21.295
that man seated there,
Justin Murray?

09:21.404 --> 09:24.605
- It was an argument.
- Can you tell us what you heard, ma'am?

09:24.708 --> 09:27.509
Well, Mr. Murray, the boyfriend...

09:27.612 --> 09:30.813
was very upset that she was still
having sex with her husband...

09:30.915 --> 09:34.582
and she said, "Look at the bright side.
His heart isn't very good.

09:34.685 --> 09:37.384
Sex increases the chance
of his having a coronary. "

09:37.489 --> 09:40.484
- Thank you.
- I said that as a joke.

09:40.592 --> 09:42.562
I'll visit you in jail. Conjugal.

09:42.660 --> 09:46.031
Your witness.

09:48.133 --> 09:50.502
Miss Stadler, when
I asked you a week ago...

09:50.603 --> 09:53.872
why you suspected my client
other husband's death...

09:53.973 --> 09:57.468
you never mentioned this remark made to the
boyfriend about sex and coronaries, did you?

09:57.578 --> 10:00.345
I wanted to keep
that nugget for trial.

10:00.447 --> 10:02.917
- You don't like Kelly Nolan?
- No, I don't.

10:03.016 --> 10:06.421
Of course not. You looked after Mr. Nolan,
she got to spend his money.

10:06.520 --> 10:10.085
Mr. Nolan and his wife
had an arrangement, did they not...

10:10.190 --> 10:12.559
where she was permitted
to date other men?

10:12.661 --> 10:15.758
All I can tell you is he wasn’t happy
about her and the boyfriend.

10:15.863 --> 10:18.836
- Was he angry about it?
- Yes.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.403
- Did he ever despair over it?
- Sometimes.

10:21.503 --> 10:24.738
He suffered a few bouts of depression
over the last couple of years, didn't he?

10:24.839 --> 10:26.741
- Minor.
- Mr. Shore, what are you doing?

10:26.841 --> 10:28.971
Just loosening up, Your Honor.

10:29.078 --> 10:31.879
- Did you killjoy Nolan?
- What?

10:31.981 --> 10:34.680
- Objection!
- You had access to the wine!

10:34.784 --> 10:37.381
- You'd better have a good faith basis for this.
- I'd love to have a basis...

10:37.487 --> 10:40.391
but since the police didn't
investigate the possibility, I'm limited.

10:40.490 --> 10:44.590
It would've been so nice if the police
had actually gathered evidence...

10:44.696 --> 10:47.360
for the purpose of arriving
at a conclusion...

10:47.465 --> 10:49.229
instead of supporting
a pre-conceived one.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.235
- Objection.
- That is stricken.

10:51.335 --> 10:53.635
I will see counsel in chambers.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.639
I warned you not to make
a mockery of these proceedings.

10:55.739 --> 10:59.646
It was damaging testimony.
I had to do something distracting.

10:59.744 --> 11:02.112
It was either accuse somebody
or drop my pants.

11:02.213 --> 11:05.778
- You've got a little froth-
- I am doubling your contempt sentence.

11:05.883 --> 11:09.414
What about his mockery?
They tried this case in the press...

11:09.521 --> 11:12.084
totally contaminated the joy pool.

11:12.191 --> 11:16.792
He kept from us the information Miss Stadler
so affectionately referred to as "her nugget. "

11:16.895 --> 11:22.237
What about your mockery, not shutting
any of this down, you psychotic punk?

11:22.335 --> 11:25.604
You're baiting me to say something
you can use on the appeal.

11:25.706 --> 11:28.769
- Your contempt sentence is tripled.
- I move for a mistrial.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.244
- On what grounds?
- On grounds of you.

11:31.345 --> 11:34.944
We're not getting a fair trial here
on grounds of you.

11:35.049 --> 11:38.044
Denied. Your sentence is quadrupled.

11:42.624 --> 11:47.829
All in all, it was considered a powerful day
for the prosecution.

11:47.929 --> 11:51.664
I must say, I always fantasize
about my murder trial.

11:51.768 --> 11:54.262
I was a little disappointed
I didn't get one.

11:54.370 --> 11:57.001
What? You want to go to prison?

11:57.106 --> 12:02.311
No, but the excitement,
being at the center obit.

12:02.412 --> 12:07.047
I think next time I'll leave little clues
like that B. T. K. killer.

12:07.151 --> 12:11.489
- Maybe little hints to make it fun.
- What do you mean, "next time"?

12:13.625 --> 12:18.067
Oh.
I just like to daydream.

12:18.163 --> 12:22.662
It's my little Walter Mitt self. I guess.

12:22.768 --> 12:27.403
Bernard, you seriously don't think
you'd ever kill again, do you?

12:27.506 --> 12:30.239
Of course not...

12:30.342 --> 12:33.337
but I miss-

12:34.947 --> 12:38.648
It was very empowering,
taking a life.

12:38.752 --> 12:40.745
It's godlike.

12:42.789 --> 12:46.320
I wouldn't do it again,
of course.

13:00.141 --> 13:03.045
- Garrett, who's my judge?
- Judge Huber in Division 3.

13:03.144 --> 13:06.549
Got divorced injury after catching
his wife with the car detailer.

13:06.648 --> 13:09.085
- She got the house in Nantucket.
- Mom. What am I arguing?

13:09.184 --> 13:11.154
The best I could come up with
is public policy.

13:11.253 --> 13:15.091
Divorce law is archaic.
You'll read the memo yourself? Right.

13:15.190 --> 13:18.129
This minister, by the way, has been sued
three times for sexual harassment.

13:18.228 --> 13:20.130
- We could base-
- That's nice.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.793
File a motion for declaratory judgment
and mark it up for tomorrow.

13:22.899 --> 13:24.801
You never should've
taken the case, Denny.

13:24.901 --> 13:28.204
When a beautiful woman says,
"Get me off:' you get her off.

13:28.305 --> 13:32.075
- It's as simple as that.
- Oh, it was never simple for you.

13:32.176 --> 13:34.841
Have we thought about our legacy?

13:34.945 --> 13:37.883
You're going to go from being Mark Garages
to being Mark Garages.

13:37.982 --> 13:41.820
Denise, you're handling
your own divorce?

13:41.919 --> 13:44.949
- I have two associates helping me.
- But _our_ handling it?

13:45.056 --> 13:47.583
- Mm-hmm.
- Hire somebody else.

13:47.693 --> 13:53.399
- Shirley-
- Denise, hire somebody else.

13:56.904 --> 14:00.138
People come to hear you sing as Edwin Starr,
even though you're not the real Edwin Starr?

14:00.239 --> 14:03.508
Yes. And, mainly,
they want me to sing "War. "

14:03.610 --> 14:06.582
Mr. Emeriti, what's the big deal?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.151
Look, we get upset with the world
for not joining our war efforts...

14:09.249 --> 14:11.515
but how can we build
a coalition abroad...

14:11.618 --> 14:15.149
if the American people
don't seem convinced?

14:15.255 --> 14:18.524
So Americans have a duty to shut up
and look convinced.

14:19.794 --> 14:21.822
We live in different times.

14:21.931 --> 14:24.801
It's my club. I choose
to support our county.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.667
This song doesn't.

14:28.804 --> 14:30.865
- Let's hear it.
- What?

14:30.972 --> 14:33.102
- I want to hear it here.
- I n court?

14:33.208 --> 14:36.044
OO tomorrow. Adjourned.

14:37.446 --> 14:40.111
Denny Crane.

14:40.215 --> 14:42.880
She's a blonde- all-natural.
Denny Crane.

14:42.985 --> 14:46.584
We were making love when, suddenly,
he started to grab his chest.

14:46.690 --> 14:48.661
I was sure he was
having a heart attack.

14:48.759 --> 14:50.729
- What did you do?
- I called 9-1-1...

14:50.828 --> 14:53.322
but by the time they got there,
it was too late.

14:53.431 --> 14:56.062
At some point, you learned
your husband had both Viagra...

14:56.167 --> 14:58.069
and nitroglycerin in his system.

14:58.169 --> 15:00.902
- Yes.
- And you learned...

15:01.005 --> 15:03.168
the nitroglycerin
had been traced to the wine.

15:03.274 --> 15:09.220
- Yes.
- It was determined the capsules were emptied into the wine.

15:09.314 --> 15:12.377
That certainly
looks like murder, Kelly.

15:12.484 --> 15:14.512
Which is exactly what he intended.

15:20.259 --> 15:24.029
- You're saying he wanted to die.
- And frame me for his murder.

15:24.130 --> 15:28.572
Even though we had an arrangement,
he became extremely angry over my affair.

15:28.669 --> 15:30.969
What about the statement
you made to your boyfriend...

15:31.070 --> 15:33.166
about your husband
having a heart attack?

15:33.273 --> 15:35.904
It was awoke, a bad one.

15:36.011 --> 15:40.042
Pretty big coincidence,
him dying of an apparent coronary.

15:40.147 --> 15:44.111
If Frances Stadler overheard the joke,
I have no doubt she told my husband about it...

15:44.219 --> 15:46.918
which likely gave him the idea.

15:47.023 --> 15:50.895
How could your husband
hate you so much...

15:50.993 --> 15:53.692
he was willing to die
just to frame you?

15:53.796 --> 15:57.463
He was willing to die, perhaps,
because he so insanely loved me...

15:57.566 --> 15:59.695
and I was giving my love to another.

15:59.803 --> 16:01.773
You didn't kill him.

16:01.872 --> 16:04.969
I absolutely did not kill him.

16:06.877 --> 16:10.214
What the hell was that?
You came off as the most unfeeling person.

16:10.313 --> 16:13.775
- Take it easy, Brad.
- The goal is to get the joy to sympathize with her...

16:13.885 --> 16:16.482
and she's coming off
like "frosty the Showgirl. "

16:16.587 --> 16:19.057
How about this question:
Do you even care if he’s dead?

16:19.157 --> 16:22.288
- All right.
- I don't get it. Is this how you tee to save your life?

16:22.393 --> 16:25.058
- What was I supposed to do, cy?
- That might be a start.

16:25.163 --> 16:28.830
Let me tell you, if you don't come off as human
in the cross-examination, you're done.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.633
- If you’re not done already.
- I can't pretend to be something I'm not.

16:31.737 --> 16:34.004
The joy would see through that,
wouldn't they?

16:34.106 --> 16:36.907
What we're telling you is
if you don't let the joy in...

16:37.010 --> 16:38.912
if they don't
see you as a human being...

16:39.012 --> 16:41.745
orate least a distant
cousin thereof-

16:41.848 --> 16:44.217
Read O/_ Ye/err tonight,
or whatever it takes...

16:44.317 --> 16:48.348
but come in here tomorrow
ready to reveal emotion...

16:48.455 --> 16:51.792
otherwise you'll be spending
the rest of your life in jail.

16:56.230 --> 16:59.532
Did he say he was
going to kill somebody?

16:59.633 --> 17:02.629
No, but I'm suddenly
beginning to think he will.

17:02.737 --> 17:05.538
Which is why I'm here-
with a heavy heart.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.942
What exactly did he say
about killing?

17:09.045 --> 17:11.846
It makes him feel godly, which-

17:11.948 --> 17:14.281
The whole reason
I introduced him to God...

17:14.382 --> 17:16.648
was to go in another direction.

17:16.752 --> 17:19.656
Well, idle fantasies-That's not something
we can arrest him for.

17:19.755 --> 17:23.319
But what about his past murders?

17:23.425 --> 17:25.453
I'm going to be honest, Mrs. Piper.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.656
You admittedly described
him as grandiose.

17:27.763 --> 17:31.329
That means his little confessions
to you could be interpreted as boasts.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.967
But you arrested him
for those murders.

17:35.073 --> 17:37.704
And couldn't prosecute him
because of lack of evidence.

17:37.809 --> 17:40.804
- But now I'm giving you evidence.
- Which is problematic.

17:40.912 --> 17:44.147
Your relationship with Mr. ferried
might vowel be an extension...

17:44.249 --> 17:46.378
of lawyer-client privilege-

17:46.484 --> 17:49.924
since that's how you first
learned of these crimes.

17:50.022 --> 17:53.324
Tell you what, I'll look
into this, discuss it with the D. A...

17:53.425 --> 17:57.525
but I'm not optimistic
at this point.

18:19.219 --> 18:21.690
It's going that well, huh?

18:21.789 --> 18:24.420
Why in God's name
did you let her testy_?

18:24.525 --> 18:28.431
Because the joy needed
to hear her say she didn't do it.

18:28.530 --> 18:32.436
That bubblehead on the news is saying
she came off cold to the point of psychotic.

18:32.534 --> 18:36.873
Hopefully, on cross, she'll warm
to the temperature of a Popsicle.

18:38.708 --> 18:43.081
The case is completely
circumstantial, Shirley.

18:43.179 --> 18:46.516
As anemic as our defense may be...

18:46.616 --> 18:52.562
the prosecution has nothing
in the end but suspicion.

18:52.656 --> 18:56.095
You're forgetting something.

18:56.194 --> 18:59.132
Everybody wants her to be convicted.

19:14.247 --> 19:17.344
- 9-1-1 operator.
- Yes, my husband has had a heart attack.

19:17.450 --> 19:23.088
Please send an ambulance.
We are at 1622 Wigwam Drive in Sudbury.

19:23.190 --> 19:25.183
As soon as you can.

19:26.325 --> 19:28.694
- That was your 9-1-1 call?
- Yes.

19:28.795 --> 19:32.097
It didn't sound wildly distressed.

19:32.199 --> 19:37.666
I was trying to remain calm to communicate
the information in the hopes of saving his life.

19:37.772 --> 19:39.867
- Ah! You were trying to appear calm.
- Yes.

19:39.974 --> 19:43.709
At that time, I didn't
know it was a crime. Now I do.

19:43.811 --> 19:47.114
According to Detective
Richmond, you weren't crying.

19:47.216 --> 19:49.652
Your mascara wasn't even running.

19:49.751 --> 19:52.120
I suppose if were tying
to get away with something...

19:52.221 --> 19:54.214
I would've made sure
there were some streaks.

19:54.322 --> 19:56.293
I might've also
washed out the wineglass...

19:56.392 --> 19:58.294
swiped it for prints.

19:58.394 --> 20:01.799
There are all sorts of things
the innocent forget to do.

20:06.836 --> 20:09.967
The whole concept of alimony
is gender-biased, Your Honor.

20:10.073 --> 20:13.240
The unstated rationale,
if you examine legislative intent...

20:13.343 --> 20:16.406
is that women cannot
provide for themselves.

20:16.513 --> 20:19.918
- Ms. Bauer, is there-
- The stated intent goes to sacrifice.

20:20.017 --> 20:24.152
Women forsaking careers to stay
at home raising families.

20:24.256 --> 20:28.857
- Ms. Bauer, I- - Certainly, the
framers never intended for this law...

20:28.960 --> 20:31.796
to be perverted to the extreme
where, one day, it could be applied...

20:31.897 --> 20:34.698
to force woman
to work to support...

20:34.800 --> 20:36.770
a deadbeat's golf habit.

20:38.171 --> 20:41.507
I detect emotion in your voice.

20:43.843 --> 20:47.339
The essence of law,
the role of judge...

20:47.447 --> 20:50.010
is to accomplish fairness.

20:50.117 --> 20:52.246
Does this seem fair to you?

20:52.353 --> 20:56.624
Counsel, I would love nothing more
than to repeal alimony...

20:56.724 --> 20:59.787
or at least amend it to some
sort of merit-based formula.

20:59.893 --> 21:04.130
Maybe someday that will happen,
but, come on.

21:04.232 --> 21:06.897
I certainly cannot grant
a declaratory motion here...

21:07.001 --> 21:08.903
and I suspect you know that.

21:09.003 --> 21:11.804
Motion denied.

21:19.281 --> 21:22.618
Given your leaning
toward acrimony...

21:22.718 --> 21:26.819
I feel I must advise my client to withdraw
the charity of heart discount.

21:26.923 --> 21:29.952
The number goes back to 890.

21:30.060 --> 21:33.157
Think on it. Pray on it.

21:33.264 --> 21:37.068
We can speak again with calm minds.

21:45.377 --> 21:48.679
What now?

21:48.780 --> 21:52.447
I'm turning this over
to the two of you.

21:52.550 --> 21:56.285
I want you to depose him. Subpoena
all his financial records, his family's records.

21:56.389 --> 21:58.359
Hit him with interrogatories,
document production.

21:58.457 --> 22:02.420
If he’s got a girlfriend, depose her.
Find out if she’s providing financial support.

22:02.528 --> 22:05.159
I want a paper war
with the reverend.

22:05.265 --> 22:07.634
I want you two to make
their lives miserable...

22:07.734 --> 22:11.697
so they both come crawling
to me to settle.

22:11.805 --> 22:14.709
This is war. This... is-

22:23.251 --> 22:26.952
This is why I went to law school-
to argue the issues.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.116
Now, are you marrying me or not?

22:29.224 --> 22:31.319
I'm still waiting for an answer.

22:31.426 --> 22:34.831
- You never asked me.
- I didn't?

22:34.930 --> 22:37.458
Hmm. I guess I tipped
my hand, didn't I?

23:13.771 --> 23:18.612
- That isn't part of the song.
- Getting both points of view. Love it. Gray area.

23:23.216 --> 23:25.186
What was with all
the-

23:25.285 --> 23:27.255
Ah, that is vintage Edwin Starr.

23:27.354 --> 23:29.551
- Ty it.
- I'll pass.

23:29.655 --> 23:31.558
No, it feels good.

23:34.362 --> 23:37.060
Alan, hey.

23:37.164 --> 23:41.400
Um, Alan Shore, meet Malcolm Holmes.

23:43.104 --> 23:45.074
Pleasure. Tara's told me
so much about you.

23:45.172 --> 23:49.409
Really? She's managed
to be surprisingly discreet about you.

23:52.881 --> 23:56.376
Oh, Malcolm and I, we-We're-

23:56.486 --> 23:59.583
Old friends. You're the one
who stole her heart.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.251
And you're the one
she willingly gave it to.

24:04.227 --> 24:07.256
- How's your trial going?
- Fine. Yours?

24:07.363 --> 24:09.493
Splendid.

24:16.273 --> 24:18.243
You're right. He is funny.

24:30.555 --> 24:33.288
Show over already?

24:33.391 --> 24:36.022
You look beaten.

24:36.127 --> 24:38.826
I just caught Tara
laughing with another man.

24:43.970 --> 24:46.669
Are you sure they weren’t
just kissing or something?

24:48.609 --> 24:52.140
No. They were laughing.

24:52.245 --> 24:55.844
I'm going to lose the girl and the case,
all in the same week.

24:55.949 --> 24:58.112
You haven't lost this case yet.

24:58.218 --> 25:00.211
Did you listen to Kelly's
testimony in court, Denny?

25:00.321 --> 25:03.157
How could the joy see her
as anything but guilty?

25:03.257 --> 25:07.322
All you need is reasonable doubt.
When I was a younger man...

25:07.428 --> 25:10.526
long before mad cow...

25:10.633 --> 25:13.400
if was losing in my closing,
I’d just keep going.

25:13.502 --> 25:15.836
I wouldn't sit until
I was sure I had it.

25:15.938 --> 25:18.306
Just wear 'me down.

25:20.409 --> 25:22.505
Reasonable doubt.

25:22.612 --> 25:25.379
You just keep going
till I give you the signal...

25:25.482 --> 25:28.511
that you’ve got it.

25:32.856 --> 25:34.826
They were really laughing?

25:37.528 --> 25:40.091
She's gone.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.274
Sara, we're done.

25:52.377 --> 25:54.711
In divorce cases, the clients
end up loathing the lawyers.

25:54.813 --> 25:57.181
The client here is
a senior associate of the firm.

25:57.282 --> 25:59.184
There's no way
we come out of this...

25:59.284 --> 26:02.085
unless, by some miracle, we can
make it go away, which we can't.

26:02.188 --> 26:05.183
- Unless-
- Unless what?

26:05.291 --> 26:08.594
Well, instead of targeting the ex-husband,
we go after the reverend.

26:08.696 --> 26:11.668
- The reverend?
- Three sexual harassment complaints.

26:11.764 --> 26:14.895
The man has a certain weakness.

26:15.001 --> 26:16.903
I don't like where this is heading.

26:17.004 --> 26:19.976
Sara, when I first met you, I said to myself.
"Wow. Now there's a funny...

26:20.074 --> 26:23.205
intellectually acute woman who can
get men to take their clothes off. "

26:23.310 --> 26:25.804
Ah! Should I say "thank you"
or slap you?

26:25.913 --> 26:28.646
I'm good with either, actually,
but, look, I have an idea.

26:28.749 --> 26:31.220
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work,
but right now...

26:31.319 --> 26:34.986
we have absolutely
nothing to lose- trust me.

26:39.794 --> 26:43.997
- 9-1-1 operator. - Yes. My
husband has had a heart attack.

26:44.100 --> 26:49.236
Please send an ambulance.
We are at 1622 Wigwam Drive in Sudbury.

26:49.339 --> 26:51.866
As soon as you can.

26:51.974 --> 26:54.104
Did that sound like grief to you?

26:54.211 --> 26:57.844
How cold, calculating is this woman?

26:57.948 --> 27:01.479
Detective Richmond told you,
she wasn't even crying at the scene.

27:01.586 --> 27:04.615
Just a blank expression
as she calmly...

27:04.722 --> 27:07.250
tried to steer the police
toward natural causes.

27:07.358 --> 27:10.854
And, then, when confronted
with the toxicology evidence...

27:10.962 --> 27:13.297
she says, "Gee, he killed
himself to get back at me. "

27:13.398 --> 27:17.805
That is the most implausible,
far-fetched, desperate theory...

27:17.903 --> 27:20.373
I've ever heard in my 17 years
as a district attorney.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.239
What kind of monster
can drug her husband...

27:23.342 --> 27:26.509
and then actually hang around
to watch him check out?

27:26.613 --> 27:29.483
Well, you saw
that monster on the stand.

27:29.582 --> 27:32.749
Flat affect. No emotion. Cold.

27:32.852 --> 27:36.724
Her testimony was chilling-
Without conscience.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.659
You got to witness, firsthand...

27:39.760 --> 27:43.461
the psyche of a murderer.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.960
Keep going till you get
reasonable doubt.

27:49.069 --> 27:51.700
I could be up there all day.

27:51.807 --> 27:54.040
Mr. Shore, we’re waiting.

27:54.142 --> 27:56.135
Yes, Your Honor.

28:01.317 --> 28:03.446
Why are we here?

28:03.553 --> 28:06.218
Certainly not because of evidence.
There isn't any.

28:06.322 --> 28:09.317
Any witnesses see my client
give her husband Viagra?

28:09.425 --> 28:12.261
Anybody see her put
nitroglycerin into his wine?

28:12.361 --> 28:15.334
No. We're being asked
to assume that evil.

28:15.432 --> 28:19.031
Well, why can't we impute
the same sinister mentality...

28:19.136 --> 28:21.538
to the deceased?

28:21.638 --> 28:24.007
Because people just
don't take their own lives?

28:24.107 --> 28:27.512
We have over a million
suicides across the globe eve year.

28:27.612 --> 28:29.844
A million. Suicide is
a much more common...

28:29.947 --> 28:33.114
and therefore plausible thing
than murder.

28:33.218 --> 28:35.712
Sow are we here?
Because Kelly Nolan...

28:35.821 --> 28:38.588
had a blank expression on her face
when the police arrived at the scene?

28:38.691 --> 28:41.162
She was in shock, for God's sake.

28:41.260 --> 28:44.562
Her husband had just died
right before her eyes.

28:44.663 --> 28:48.068
Fingerprints on the wine glass?
It was her house.

28:48.167 --> 28:50.365
She was having wine
with her husband.

28:50.470 --> 28:54.706
Is it so inconceivable
that she would touch his glass?

28:54.808 --> 28:58.043
And if she were guilty, don’t you think
she would've wiped the glass clean...

28:58.144 --> 29:02.050
or washed it so the nitro
wouldn't have been detected?

29:02.148 --> 29:06.089
Why are we here? Because her husband
allegedly threatened...

29:06.187 --> 29:09.091
to cut her out of his will
two days before?

29:09.190 --> 29:11.251
According to Kelly,
that never happened.

29:11.359 --> 29:15.801
The housekeeper says it did, but this is
a witness who admittedly loathed my client...

29:15.898 --> 29:21.069
who admittedly concealed information
from me so she could do more damage at trial.

29:21.169 --> 29:26.009
She has a bias and the prosecution
offered nobody to corroborate her.

29:26.108 --> 29:28.101
So, why are we here?

29:28.211 --> 29:30.738
The corona joke
made to the boyfriend.

29:30.847 --> 29:34.617
Suspiciously coincidental, but that
was something she side_, not did.

29:34.718 --> 29:38.852
And she said it inject. Let's remember,
there is no suggestion...

29:38.955 --> 29:43.260
that either the boyfriend or the housekeeper
took this remark seriously for a second.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.526
If they did, why did they not
contact the police?

29:46.630 --> 29:50.435
There is simply no evidence
that would allow you to conclude...

29:50.535 --> 29:53.632
beyond all reasonable doubt,
that Kelly Nolan killed her husband.

29:53.738 --> 29:56.710
So why are we here?

29:56.809 --> 30:02.275
But, as long as we are,
what about the police?

30:02.381 --> 30:05.876
They admittedly didn't investigate
any other theory, including suicide.

30:05.984 --> 30:10.859
You heard Detective Richmond.
They immediately focused on Kelly and only Kelly...

30:10.958 --> 30:12.951
because she's the one
they wanted to get.

30:13.059 --> 30:15.222
And I don't know about you...

30:15.329 --> 30:18.495
but I certainly find it
curious that the prosecution...

30:18.598 --> 30:21.695
instead of reprising evidence
in his closing argument...

30:21.803 --> 30:24.365
chose to focus on my client's
testimonial demeanor.

30:24.471 --> 30:26.999
What the hell is that?
He wants you...

30:27.107 --> 30:31.674
to convict her of murder because
she came off as cold in a witness chair.

30:31.779 --> 30:35.014
I saw cold too,
but what I mainly observed...

30:35.116 --> 30:38.088
was somebody who was
rigidly unapologetic.

30:38.186 --> 30:41.523
Well, wrongly accused people
tend to be that way.

30:41.623 --> 30:46.691
How warm would any of you be
if you were falsely accused of murder...

30:46.796 --> 30:49.062
if you were made sport of
by the media...

30:49.164 --> 30:54.107
if your privacy was violated and naked
pictures of you were posted on the Internet?

30:54.204 --> 30:58.702
People who are unrelentingly vilified
tend to end up cold and hard.

30:58.809 --> 31:01.713
Kelly Nolan has
emotionally shut down.

31:01.812 --> 31:05.752
She cannot feel, she cannot emote
and she cannot fake vulnerability...

31:05.850 --> 31:08.686
for the purpose of appealing
to a joy’s sympathy.

31:08.786 --> 31:12.556
She's innocent and she's
not required to prove it.

31:14.826 --> 31:17.730
Schadenfreude.

31:19.364 --> 31:21.630
From the German words
Shade _n_ fraud-

31:21.733 --> 31:23.635
"damage" and "joy. "

31:23.736 --> 31:27.266
It means to take spiteful,
malicious delight...

31:27.373 --> 31:29.536
in the misfortune of others.

31:29.642 --> 31:34.448
We used to dismiss this
as simply an ugly side of human nature...

31:34.547 --> 31:36.814
but it is much, much more than that.

31:36.917 --> 31:41.655
Recently, a Stanford professor actually
captured schadenfreude on a brain scan.

31:41.755 --> 31:44.488
It's a physiological,
medical phenomenon.

31:44.591 --> 31:48.896
When we see others fall, it sometimes
causes a chemical to be released...

31:48.997 --> 31:51.594
in the dorsal striatum
of the brain...

31:51.699 --> 31:54.671
which actually causes us
to feel pleasure.

31:54.769 --> 31:57.434
If you watch the news
or read the papers-

31:57.539 --> 32:00.568
Which, of course, you don't,
because the judge said not to.

32:00.676 --> 32:03.146
But if you did, you would see...

32:03.244 --> 32:05.146
the undeniable, delicious joy...

32:05.247 --> 32:08.185
of the media and the public
over Kelly Nolan's plight.

32:08.284 --> 32:10.618
I have no doubt...

32:10.719 --> 32:12.621
that you want Kelly Nolan
to be punished.

32:12.722 --> 32:16.526
She married for money.
She had an am air.

32:16.626 --> 32:19.189
She carried on naked in
the pool with her boyfriend.

32:19.296 --> 32:22.963
She's cold, materialistic,
unlikable.

32:23.067 --> 32:27.975
And it might bring you all
pleasure to see her go to jail.

32:28.072 --> 32:33.482
But as for evidence to establish
that she committed a murder...

32:33.578 --> 32:36.573
beyond all reasonable doubt...

32:36.682 --> 32:38.709
it just isn't there.

32:40.151 --> 32:45.720
The only possible route
to a guilty verdict here...

32:45.824 --> 32:47.818
is schadenfreude.

32:58.005 --> 33:00.532
Thank you.

33:16.658 --> 33:19.687
The judge is expected
to keep the joy sequestered...

33:19.794 --> 33:23.393
throughout deliberations,
even during weekends.

33:23.498 --> 33:25.901
- In other news-
- Can you imagine?

33:26.002 --> 33:28.439
What I wouldn't give
to be a fly on the wall.

33:28.538 --> 33:31.601
I thought you didn't like
being a little bug.

33:31.707 --> 33:34.372
It was a figure of speech.

33:34.477 --> 33:37.040
Catherine, I don't like the tone I've been
hearing from you this week.

33:37.147 --> 33:39.208
What are you going to do,
whack me on the head?

33:41.051 --> 33:45.390
I'm sorry, Bernie,
but that little comment you made...

33:45.489 --> 33:47.983
about feeling godly
and killing people-

33:48.092 --> 33:51.428
- That concerned me.
- I said that inject.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.296
No, you didn't.

33:54.399 --> 33:58.169
I think maybe our friendship...

33:58.269 --> 34:01.435
should take a little break.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.671
You can't do that.

34:04.777 --> 34:07.544
Why can't I? I've made a mistake.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.083
I thought you were taller.
We move on.

34:10.183 --> 34:14.214
You exacted certain
confidences from me.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.953
Without a friendship,
how can I rely on our trust?

34:18.058 --> 34:23.331
I won't betray your trust,
Bernie. I just need a break.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.456
Now is not the time to leave me.

34:25.565 --> 34:29.505
I am still dealing with the tragic,
unexpected loss of my mother.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.574
You killed her.

34:31.672 --> 34:33.665
That doesn't mitigate my pain.

34:33.774 --> 34:36.007
Catherine.

34:36.110 --> 34:39.344
I need you in my life. Could we...

34:39.447 --> 34:41.610
just continue to talk about this?

34:41.717 --> 34:43.914
Please?

34:47.556 --> 34:50.791
Sure. Sure.

34:54.364 --> 34:57.996
You don't think this constitutes abuse
of process? A hundred interrogatories.

34:58.102 --> 35:00.504
Questions which go to his favorite food,
his taste in clothing.

35:00.603 --> 35:03.439
Notice of depositions
of family members.

35:03.539 --> 35:06.204
It saddens me, Sara.

35:06.309 --> 35:09.441
Reverend, I'm in a vey
difficult position here.

35:09.546 --> 35:13.817
Obviously, I have a vey
emotional senior associate...

35:13.918 --> 35:16.856
directing me to be as contentious
as humanly possible.

35:16.955 --> 35:19.791
With the resources of this firm...

35:19.891 --> 35:22.192
we can make it cost you
four to get your eight.

35:22.295 --> 35:25.631
Can't we just find a number
that works for everybody?

35:25.731 --> 35:29.135
My client, too, is emotional.

35:30.936 --> 35:36.244
Look, lawyer to lawyer,
there's nothing worse than divorce law.

35:36.342 --> 35:40.807
Let's, you and me,
figure this out together.

35:42.516 --> 35:46.752
It won’t be easy...

35:46.853 --> 35:50.817
given all this acrimony.

35:50.925 --> 35:53.054
Forget the acrimony.

35:55.363 --> 36:00.704
You and me together, we can do this.

36:16.686 --> 36:20.751
It's a lovely song, but, I repeat,
this is a private club.

36:20.857 --> 36:23.055
People can hire the kind
of entertainment they want.

36:23.160 --> 36:27.727
- It's called "freedom. "
- Your Honor, beware private industry.

36:27.832 --> 36:31.704
Television networks are
becoming afraid of losing their sponsors.

36:31.802 --> 36:34.467
Their parent companies fear
losing government contracts...

36:34.572 --> 36:39.276
and, suddenly, Robin Williams can’t joke
about a homosexual sponge at the Oscars.

36:39.378 --> 36:43.479
Linda Ronstadt got kicked out of
her hotel room in Las Vegas...

36:43.582 --> 36:46.281
for making anti-war comments
at one other concerts.

36:46.386 --> 36:49.985
Bill Maher got canceled
for making a politically incorrect joke...

36:50.089 --> 36:52.286
on a show called
Politically Incorrect.

36:52.392 --> 36:56.390
Never mind the government
or state action...

36:56.496 --> 37:00.630
it's private corporations that are becoming
the biggest predators of free expression.

37:00.733 --> 37:04.640
Censorship can certainly
be no less acceptable...

37:04.738 --> 37:08.644
when the motivating factor is money.

37:09.676 --> 37:12.011
All right.

37:12.113 --> 37:15.142
I think the idea of squashing
this song is ridiculous.

37:15.250 --> 37:19.385
The idea that an anti-war message
can be deemed un-American...

37:19.487 --> 37:21.480
is patently preposterous.

37:21.589 --> 37:26.224
In fact, as someone who
considers herself patriotic...

37:26.328 --> 37:30.702
I'm offended by the accusation
that America is pro-war.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.328
- Here comes the dreaded "however. "
- However...

37:33.437 --> 37:38.675
as much as I would like
to find on your behalf, Mr. Damon.

37:38.775 --> 37:41.473
As much as private enterprises
are more and more...

37:41.578 --> 37:44.607
being subjected
to civil rights actions...

37:46.483 --> 37:51.893
I'm afraid a club owner still has the right
to control his entertainment content.

37:51.989 --> 37:57.022
Your motion is therefore denied.

37:57.128 --> 37:59.497
Bollocks. I never win.

38:05.904 --> 38:09.138
Look at his eyes. Nutcase.

38:14.613 --> 38:18.144
Mr. foreman, you've reached
a unanimous verdict?

38:18.251 --> 38:21.884
- We have.
- The defendant will please rise.

38:21.988 --> 38:24.892
Mr. foreman, what say you?

38:24.992 --> 38:27.690
In the matter of
the Commonwealth versus Kelly Nolan...

38:27.795 --> 38:30.357
on the charge of murder
in the first degree, we, the joy...

38:30.464 --> 38:34.097
find the defendant,
Kelly Nolan, not guilty.

38:39.274 --> 38:42.645
- Down, girl.
- Members of the joy...

38:42.744 --> 38:44.873
this concludes your service.

38:44.980 --> 38:49.786
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
thanks you. Mrs. Nolan, you are free to go.

38:49.885 --> 38:54.590
Mr. Shore, you will report to lockup
at 9:OO a. m. tomorrow. We are adjourned.

39:01.697 --> 39:03.861
- Hey!
- Mr. Crane. Hi.

39:13.478 --> 39:15.448
Thank you.

39:28.660 --> 39:32.395
Undoubtedly you’re familiar
with the concept of double jeopardy.

39:32.499 --> 39:35.960
You've been acquitted. You can never again
be tried for this crime.

39:36.068 --> 39:41.741
And, of course, anything you say to me here
is protected by attorney-client privilege.

39:44.678 --> 39:48.914
Kelly, I absolutely must know.

39:49.015 --> 39:50.986
Did you kill him?

39:56.592 --> 39:58.687
No.

40:24.954 --> 40:27.016
The verdict came as a surprise...

40:27.124 --> 40:29.117
to legal analysts who were
following the proceedings.

40:29.226 --> 40:32.631
Jurors interviewed said
that while they did conclude...

40:32.730 --> 40:34.723
that Kelly Nolan
was probably guilty...

40:34.832 --> 40:36.961
they just couldn't get there
beyond all reasonable doubt.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.732
I bet she kills again.

40:39.837 --> 40:44.302
- You think she'll kill again?
- I don't know, dear.

40:44.409 --> 40:49.375
See, the thing is,
once you’ve gotten a taste obit...

40:49.482 --> 40:53.684
it's really hard to go back
to an ordinary life.

40:53.786 --> 40:56.758
That's what I struggle with,
I think.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.728
Better?

41:07.434 --> 41:09.701
As God is my witness-

41:15.776 --> 41:17.770
My only witness.

41:25.454 --> 41:28.221
She barely reacted when the verdict was read.
Did you notice that?

41:28.323 --> 41:30.350
I noticed.

41:30.459 --> 41:35.060
How could a woman be
so cold and yet so hot?

41:35.164 --> 41:38.569
One other many mysteries.

41:38.668 --> 41:42.130
Never had my sex with her.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.208
There's no justice.

41:44.307 --> 41:49.410
Did we get justice today, Alan?

41:49.513 --> 41:52.747
I don't know.

41:52.849 --> 41:55.651
I think she did it. No.

41:55.753 --> 41:59.989
Maybe I want to think that,
'cause, like you say, it could be "shutterbug. "

42:00.091 --> 42:03.064
"Schadenfreude. "

42:03.161 --> 42:06.031
Murder cases are fun,
I'll tell yak that.

42:06.131 --> 42:10.231
- Let's get another one.
- I'm with you.

42:12.838 --> 42:14.899
I like the pathological. It's sexy.

42:18.544 --> 42:21.642
Let's get another one like her.

42:21.749 --> 42:24.846
My eyes are peeled.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.492
You stinker!
