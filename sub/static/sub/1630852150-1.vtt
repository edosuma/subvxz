01:50.410 --> 01:51.612
Your husband had several

01:51.713 --> 01:53.513
respiratory
obstructions per hour,

01:53.614 --> 01:55.449
but not enough
to warrant a CPAP.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.852
At least from the point of view
of your insurance company.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.754
So it's up to you
if you want one,

01:59.854 --> 02:01.889
but it probably
won't be covered.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.992
So he has sleep apnea?

02:05.093 --> 02:05.927
Yes.

02:06.027 --> 02:06.994
But it's mild.

02:07.095 --> 02:09.831
I would recommend
he sleep with a mouth guard.

02:10.230 --> 02:11.498
You can get one
over the counter,

02:11.598 --> 02:13.233
or we can fit you for one.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.268
It will position his jaw
in such a way

02:15.368 --> 02:17.605
that his breathing
will be unobstructed.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.807
Should also
take care of your snoring.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.009
But I might add
that diet and exercise

02:22.110 --> 02:23.644
could help with that as well.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.613
What about his sleep talking?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.182
Sleep talking?

02:28.348 --> 02:29.684
Yeah, that's why
we did this whole study

02:29.784 --> 02:31.219
to begin with, remember?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.555
Study shows
no evidence of somniloquy.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.658
And you recorded him
the entire time?

02:38.726 --> 02:40.393
Was the microphone working?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.328
Yes.

02:41.763 --> 02:42.462
But how do you know?

02:42.764 --> 02:44.665
Because the technician
would have been alerted

02:44.766 --> 02:46.734
had it stopped
at any point during the study.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.769
Where was
the microphone placed?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.670
- Was it a camera?
- It was taped near his throat,

02:49.771 --> 02:51.005
along with the other electrodes

02:51.105 --> 02:53.273
that were recording
his body functions.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.943
- It's un-fucking-believable.
- Honey, now look...

02:56.043 --> 02:57.879
Did he actually sleep
through the entire study?

02:57.979 --> 02:58.746
I mean, you said so yourself,

02:59.147 --> 03:00.915
you couldn't sleep with
all those wires attached to you.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.651
The report says
that he had five hours of sleep.

03:05.086 --> 03:06.586
He talks in his sleep
every night,

03:06.687 --> 03:08.588
and every night
it's the same conversation.

03:09.157 --> 03:11.291
Okay, I'm sorry.
Alex, would you not raise...

03:11.391 --> 03:12.660
He's talking to another woman.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.728
How do you know
it's another woman?

03:13.828 --> 03:15.930
Because he says both sides
of the conversation,

03:16.030 --> 03:18.298
and it's one
we've never had before.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.735
- Okay, this is kinda crazy.
- Stop saying that.

03:21.836 --> 03:22.703
Stop it.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.472
I'm not crazy.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.540
Honey, I didn't
say you were crazy.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.575
I said this, this is crazy.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.344
Have you tried recording it?

03:31.679 --> 03:32.579
Yes.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.315
And it never sounds the same.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.583
Because of that
stupid sound machine

03:36.684 --> 03:37.985
that you bought me.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.720
We got it to help
Alex sleep at night.

03:39.821 --> 03:41.388
Yeah, some help that was.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.692
And how are you sleeping,
then, Alex?

03:46.027 --> 03:46.894
I don't.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.896
I lie awake every night

03:48.996 --> 03:51.032
listening to him
talk to another woman.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.927
I thought we had an agreement.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.699
We did. I'm here, aren't I?

06:08.636 --> 06:09.704
I thought we'd agreed

06:09.804 --> 06:11.605
that medication
was the best approach,

06:11.706 --> 06:13.040
so why the sudden change?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.642
No,
I never agreed to that.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.944
You've been pushing it
on me the entire time.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.180
But it can help.

06:19.981 --> 06:22.650
And I'm not just talking
about sleep medications.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.952
There are effective drugs
on the market

06:25.386 --> 06:27.554
that can help
not only your anxiety,

06:27.655 --> 06:29.156
but your cognitive
reasoning as well.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.792
How? By masking the situation?

06:32.727 --> 06:35.029
Counseling
can only take you so far

06:35.129 --> 06:36.931
without the aid of medication,

06:37.031 --> 06:38.799
which you desperately need.

06:40.034 --> 06:42.069
What you describe
to me is troubling.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.805
For you, your marriage,

06:44.905 --> 06:48.508
your career,
your health, your mental state.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.613
And there are many people
worried about you.

06:53.047 --> 06:54.281
Myself included.

06:56.751 --> 06:59.086
You don't have
to continue struggling.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.156
You just need to trust me.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.319
Hi, miss?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.190
Are you hurt?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.259
No, I can't feel my hand!

07:38.558 --> 07:40.127
I can't feel my hand!

07:40.227 --> 07:42.663
Have you been drinking?
Are you on any medications?

07:42.763 --> 07:43.898
- No.
- Breathe.

07:43.998 --> 07:45.800
No, are you a doctor?

07:45.900 --> 07:46.767
No.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.170
Just watched
too much TV, I guess.

07:49.270 --> 07:49.737
Sorry.

07:50.438 --> 07:51.138
I don't know why I just
asked you all those questions.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.808
- I just want to go.
- Oh. Hey. Hey.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.076
I don't know my what...

07:55.176 --> 07:55.943
- I don't know...
- Hey, hey.

07:56.277 --> 07:57.278
- ...what is wrong with me.
- Look at me, look at me.

07:57.378 --> 07:59.814
It seems like you might
be having a panic attack.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.082
It's okay.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.750
I'm here.

08:03.184 --> 08:04.819
Okay. Look at me. Look at me.

08:05.119 --> 08:06.320
Hey.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.222
Look at me.

08:08.989 --> 08:09.890
Just breathe.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.061
I'm here.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.933
Is there someone we can call?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.340
I think my husband
is having an affair.

08:50.331 --> 08:51.198
Oh.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.100
Sorry.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.203
Was I snoring again?

09:08.415 --> 09:10.217
Where are you going, Ian?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.220
- To the couch.
- Get back in bed.

09:13.888 --> 09:15.389
So you can hit me
when I start snoring?

09:15.489 --> 09:17.358
I didn't hit you
because you were snoring.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.934
You really
don't believe me, do you?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.102
Believe what?

09:31.338 --> 09:32.206
Oh.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.076
So I was talking
in my sleep again.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.912
Is that it?

09:38.913 --> 09:39.847
Jesus Christ.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.115
Do you think I'm making this up?

09:41.515 --> 09:43.317
You think that
this is all in my head.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.387
- I don't think, I know...
- Do you think I enjoy this?

09:46.487 --> 09:48.722
You think I like imagining
that you're having an affair?

09:49.523 --> 09:50.925
I don't know.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.126
Maybe you do.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.329
Maybe you enjoy being miserable.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.731
Maybe you enjoy
torturing yourself

09:57.831 --> 10:00.301
and everyone else around you
for no goddamn reason.

10:00.401 --> 10:01.402
How can you say that?

10:02.303 --> 10:04.104
How can you say that?

10:04.606 --> 10:08.142
Every night you accuse me,
and no matter what I say,

10:08.242 --> 10:10.144
and no matter
how many times I say it,

10:10.244 --> 10:12.079
you don't fucking believe me!

10:14.381 --> 10:15.482
Well, are you?

10:16.050 --> 10:18.319
- Am I what?
- Are you having an affair?

10:20.221 --> 10:23.390
For the last time, no.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.426
I am not cheating on you.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.495
Have you before?

10:28.596 --> 10:29.863
No.

10:35.436 --> 10:37.004
Maybe it was suppressed guilt.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.473
A secret that's eating at you.

10:40.274 --> 10:42.109
Maybe it was a moment.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.377
A moment of weakness

10:43.477 --> 10:45.379
that your subconscious
just won't let go of,

10:45.479 --> 10:46.947
and that's why you keep talking.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.182
I don't talk in my sleep.

10:48.282 --> 10:49.450
Sleep study
proved that months ago.

10:49.550 --> 10:50.985
Oh, but you do.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.920
I hear it. It's as clear as day.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.955
And the scenario
is always the same.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.957
- She comes over...
- This is insane.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.027
She asks if I'm home,
and you tell her I'm at work.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.796
We have been over this
a million fucking times.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.331
Then you start
having sex with her.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.333
- Why are you doing this to me?
- In our fucking house!

11:06.433 --> 11:09.236
Are you mad at me
because I lost my job?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.172
Is that it?
Are you mad because... what?

11:12.273 --> 11:13.340
You have to go to work every day

11:13.440 --> 11:15.009
- and I stay at home?
- Damn straight!

11:15.744 --> 11:17.144
It's hard going
to work every day

11:17.244 --> 11:18.879
when your husband
is screwing another woman

11:18.979 --> 11:20.481
in the home you slave
to pay the mortgage for.

11:20.581 --> 11:21.782
Jesus Christ.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.386
Ian?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.033
Fuck.

12:51.472 --> 12:53.073
Fuck. My phone.

13:28.643 --> 13:29.543
Hey.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.613
You're up late.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.514
Hey, Nate.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.116
What are you
still doing out, man?

13:36.684 --> 13:37.551
Uh...

13:38.552 --> 13:39.987
You know.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.488
Yeah, just
one of those nights, huh?

13:41.588 --> 13:42.624
Yeah.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.659
Yeah.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.561
You haven't seen her, have you?

13:47.662 --> 13:48.562
Becca?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.597
No. What's up?

13:50.865 --> 13:52.433
Well, she took off.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.201
Just, I can't find her.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.469
Wait, what do you mean?

13:55.569 --> 13:57.304
I mean,
we were asleep, I...

13:57.739 --> 13:59.440
I woke up, she's gone.

13:59.808 --> 14:01.575
- Did she take her phone?
- Yeah.

14:01.676 --> 14:03.577
She's not fucking answering it.

14:06.781 --> 14:08.248
You wanna have a drink?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.184
Right now?

14:10.284 --> 14:12.152
Yeah. I mean,
I know it's late, but...

14:12.252 --> 14:14.188
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
until I know she's safe.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.724
Come on, man.

14:17.659 --> 14:18.626
I could use the company.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.461
Sure.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.496
Fuck it. Why not?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.501
- You like whiskey?
- Yeah, sure.

14:32.406 --> 14:33.675
- Oh, that's good.
- All right.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.113
All right.

14:40.715 --> 14:41.716
Shitty nights.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.584
Shitty neighbors.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.261
We gotta hang out more, man.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.596
- Yeah.
- I mean that.

14:56.731 --> 14:59.333
You know? I know I always say
that shit when we get together,

14:59.433 --> 15:00.400
but I'm serious.

15:02.236 --> 15:05.038
Life just always gets in the way
of best intentions, you know?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.245
You guys doing good, though?

15:12.714 --> 15:14.281
You still looking for a job?

15:14.782 --> 15:16.651
Yeah. Yeah, but...

15:17.284 --> 15:19.286
No, we're hanging in there.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.488
How are you guys doing?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.126
I mean, this past year's
been a fucking mess,

15:26.226 --> 15:28.796
but, you know,
Becca losing the baby.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.197
Oh.

15:30.564 --> 15:32.800
Oh, man, look,
we heard about that, I'm...

15:33.400 --> 15:35.102
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't worry.

15:35.803 --> 15:37.739
I mean, she lost the baby
in the first trimester,

15:37.839 --> 15:39.306
so it wasn't like...

15:39.607 --> 15:40.742
a full-grown baby.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.177
Well, look, man,
we should have reached out.

15:44.779 --> 15:45.813
It's okay.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.784
I mean, Becca didn't really
want anyone to know.

15:51.552 --> 15:53.487
She likes to keep things
a little private.

15:54.622 --> 15:55.389
I mean, hell, half the time

15:55.723 --> 15:58.258
I don't even know
what she's thinking, you know?

15:58.960 --> 16:00.527
It's like there's
this whole side to her

16:00.628 --> 16:02.462
that I have no idea about.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.467
I mean, I guess
we all kinda have that.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.609
You guys think
about having kids?

16:15.877 --> 16:17.277
Not really.

16:18.312 --> 16:19.546
Not now, anyway.

16:20.882 --> 16:22.617
Marriage is so hard, you know,

16:22.717 --> 16:24.652
- why bring other people into it?
- Oh, right.

16:25.820 --> 16:26.721
Fuck it.

16:29.523 --> 16:31.091
I envy you guys.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.331
Hm, never really thought
there was much to...

16:37.865 --> 16:39.266
I mean...

16:39.366 --> 16:41.168
I don't mean
like that, it's just...

16:43.537 --> 16:45.339
You guys just
have your shit together.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.309
Well... looks can be deceiving.

16:50.878 --> 16:53.513
Not from where
I'm sitting, man.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.818
Not from where I'm sitting.

17:01.756 --> 17:03.523
I wanna show you something.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.562
Heard about that break-in
the other day on Cramer?

17:09.363 --> 17:10.064
Yeah.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.900
This fucker broke in
in the middle of the night,

17:13.300 --> 17:15.903
stole a bunch of shit,
tied them up and everything?

17:17.972 --> 17:19.239
It's why I got this thing.

17:20.842 --> 17:21.776
Is it real?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.443
'Course it's real.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.579
Is it loaded?

17:26.614 --> 17:27.815
You tell me.

17:31.019 --> 17:33.220
I'm just kidding, man.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.292
Kind of melts
in your hand, doesn't it?

17:43.765 --> 17:45.867
I've never been much
of a gun nut, but these days?

17:46.466 --> 17:47.367
Fuck.

17:47.735 --> 17:48.903
Wanna take
that thing to the range?

17:50.672 --> 17:52.506
Squeeze the trigger,
feel the power?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.643
Kinda turns me on.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.281
I'm not letting anyone
fuck with me anymore.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.317
It's cool.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.728
You guys have protection, right?

18:14.962 --> 18:16.764
Yeah. Actually. But...

18:17.364 --> 18:20.400
Just one of those, like,
small, handgun things?

18:21.435 --> 18:22.569
I don't know. We...

18:22.670 --> 18:23.838
bought the house, and I thought,

18:23.938 --> 18:26.440
you know, might as well
buy a gun, yeah?

18:27.041 --> 18:28.843
But I don't think
I've ever actually shot it.

18:29.177 --> 18:30.712
We should go shooting, man.

18:31.646 --> 18:32.780
Me and you.

18:33.948 --> 18:35.549
There's a range ten miles away.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.886
Be fun, man. My treat.

18:40.988 --> 18:42.556
Sure.

18:42.657 --> 18:43.490
Why not?

18:44.458 --> 18:45.459
Nice.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.531
Cheers.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.750
Sorry. I just...

19:10.383 --> 19:11.919
It's okay. Have a seat.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.801
What exactly is this
supposed to accomplish?

19:28.669 --> 19:31.538
Try to imagine Ian
sitting across from you.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.675
You can close
your eyes if it helps.

19:36.744 --> 19:37.779
Do you see him?

19:42.917 --> 19:43.785
Okay.

19:44.518 --> 19:45.686
Open your eyes.

19:47.622 --> 19:48.756
And talk to him.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.025
Tell him how you feel.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.931
This is stupid.

19:57.031 --> 19:58.398
Trust me.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.034
Talk to him.

20:01.602 --> 20:03.004
The floor is yours.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.940
He can't interrupt you.

20:06.741 --> 20:07.875
He can't leave.

20:08.242 --> 20:10.878
He has to listen
to everything you say.

20:16.017 --> 20:17.051
Uh...

20:18.986 --> 20:19.987
Why...

20:23.157 --> 20:24.959
wasn't I good enough?

20:28.062 --> 20:29.864
Didn't I make you happy?

20:32.033 --> 20:34.769
We used to be happy,
and what happened to us?

20:37.437 --> 20:38.806
What does she have
that I don't have? I mean...

20:38.906 --> 20:40.473
Not a goddamn thing, but...

20:40.808 --> 20:41.676
Just...

20:43.611 --> 20:45.378
Maybe it was the bloody accent.

20:46.647 --> 20:47.949
Are you really that heartless?

20:50.117 --> 20:51.652
You really that shallow?

21:01.528 --> 21:03.363
You really think
I'm that stupid?

21:06.133 --> 21:07.802
Do you really
think I'm that naive?

21:08.669 --> 21:09.937
That I can't see?

21:10.705 --> 21:12.807
'Cause I see you change
when you're around her.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.544
That cadence in your voice.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.516
That subtle flirting...

21:27.554 --> 21:29.790
And that lingering smile,
I know that. Yeah.

21:30.091 --> 21:31.524
'Cause that's a...

21:33.526 --> 21:35.129
What you got
when I first met you.

21:36.998 --> 21:38.398
And now you're
doing it with her,

21:38.498 --> 21:39.767
in front of me.

21:40.201 --> 21:41.434
In our fucking house.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.670
What is this doing here?

21:42.770 --> 21:44.404
Why is there
a second chair here?

21:45.106 --> 21:46.573
So you can talk to her.

21:47.808 --> 21:48.676
Who?

21:49.476 --> 21:50.378
The other woman.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.747
The woman you think
is sleeping with Ian.

21:54.248 --> 21:55.116
Think.

21:56.918 --> 21:57.818
Yeah.

21:58.252 --> 21:59.186
I'm sorry.

21:59.287 --> 22:00.187
Okay. Great.

22:00.288 --> 22:01.923
I was having a moment there.

22:02.189 --> 22:03.057
And...

22:03.791 --> 22:06.160
- I need to just...
- Now you can have it with her.

22:08.095 --> 22:09.864
This is fucking ridiculous.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.867
We gotta do this
again some time, man.

22:12.967 --> 22:14.068
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

22:14.168 --> 22:15.169
- I'm gonna call you.
- All right.

22:15.269 --> 22:15.970
All right. No bullshitting.

22:16.304 --> 22:17.939
Some good whiskey, man.

22:18.739 --> 22:21.441
Hey. Don't worry
about it, all right?

22:21.909 --> 22:23.510
- I'm sure she's fine.
- Yeah.

22:24.312 --> 22:25.880
I don't know why
we always fight at night.

22:27.014 --> 22:28.182
You know what?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.651
Alex and I do the same thing.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.452
Must be something in the water.

22:34.188 --> 22:36.223
I told her I thought
she was seeing someone.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.727
Why are you
telling me this, Nate?

22:40.527 --> 22:42.595
You're home a lot during the day
when she is.

22:44.932 --> 22:47.068
You ever see anyone
come by when I'm at work?

22:47.668 --> 22:51.839
Nate, I don't know,
I keep to myself.

22:51.939 --> 22:53.074
You've never seen, like,

22:53.174 --> 22:54.842
a strange car in the driveway,

22:54.942 --> 22:56.744
- or someone walking up?
- No.

22:58.312 --> 22:59.780
I mean, you'd
tell me if you had, right?

22:59.880 --> 23:01.816
Look, I don't know, I...

23:02.350 --> 23:04.051
I don't like to get involved
in people's business,

23:04.151 --> 23:05.720
it's not my place.

23:05.820 --> 23:07.021
But you'd do it for a friend?

23:08.756 --> 23:09.657
Yeah.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.793
I would do it for a friend.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.862
It's all I needed to hear, man.

23:17.198 --> 23:18.265
It's weird, isn't it?

23:19.000 --> 23:19.867
What is?

23:20.368 --> 23:21.669
You get
in a fight with your wife,

23:21.769 --> 23:22.770
you go for a drive.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.873
I get in a fight with my wife,
she disappears.

23:27.341 --> 23:28.541
Good night, Nate.

23:29.377 --> 23:30.945
What were you guys
fighting about?

23:32.213 --> 23:33.814
I mean, if you
don't mind me asking.

23:34.915 --> 23:35.816
I snore.

23:56.704 --> 23:57.671
Babe.

23:58.606 --> 23:59.807
I'm so sorry.

24:00.608 --> 24:02.710
I don't know
what's gotten into me.

24:04.311 --> 24:06.180
I haven't been
myself lately, you know?

24:07.114 --> 24:09.617
Let's just forget
this whole thing ever happened.

24:11.285 --> 24:12.820
Let me make it up to you.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.121
Hm.

24:19.894 --> 24:21.295
God, I missed you.

24:22.730 --> 24:23.898
- I missed us.
- Oh yeah.

24:27.201 --> 24:28.302
I want you to fuck me.

24:28.402 --> 24:29.670
- Yeah?
- Right now.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.205
Yeah.

24:37.311 --> 24:40.147
Now I want you to fuck me
like you fuck her.

24:40.247 --> 24:41.282
- What?
- Okay?

24:41.615 --> 24:43.818
Just tell me her name,
and imagine I'm her.

24:44.285 --> 24:46.020
I want you to scream
her name when you come.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.587
What the fuck is wrong with you?

24:47.688 --> 24:48.989
Oh, isn't this what you want?

24:49.090 --> 24:49.757
I can be your fucktoy.

24:50.191 --> 24:52.626
I can be that, baby.
I can be whatever you want.

24:52.726 --> 24:54.161
I'll do my hair like her.

24:54.462 --> 24:55.696
Dress like her.

24:55.796 --> 24:56.797
I'll even talk like her,

24:56.931 --> 24:59.633
and then you won't need her,
because you'll have me.

25:00.801 --> 25:01.702
What?

25:02.803 --> 25:04.038
Just admit it.

25:05.106 --> 25:06.707
It's okay, I'm okay with it.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.209
I'm not going to leave you.

25:08.709 --> 25:10.144
I could never do that.

25:10.578 --> 25:12.780
I just need to hear you say it.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.948
I haven't done anything.

25:14.048 --> 25:15.683
But you have. I know you have.

25:15.783 --> 25:16.984
You've been doing it for months.

25:17.251 --> 25:19.620
And it's okay,
just tell me who she is.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.722
And this whole thing
will go away.

25:21.822 --> 25:24.992
Alex. Alex. You need help.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.629
You've imagined
this whole thing in your head.

25:28.729 --> 25:30.064
It's been consuming you
for months.

25:30.498 --> 25:31.632
It's not healthy.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.868
It's making you fucking crazy.

25:36.270 --> 25:37.138
Please.

25:38.139 --> 25:39.940
Just tell me who she is.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.644
I can't keep going on like this.

25:44.812 --> 25:46.914
Please, just tell me her name.

25:47.014 --> 25:49.049
There isn't anything to tell.

25:49.683 --> 25:52.653
Because there isn't anyone.

26:04.431 --> 26:05.666
Mm.

26:05.766 --> 26:06.767
- What the fuck?
- No!

26:22.116 --> 26:23.717
What you doing?

26:26.487 --> 26:28.055
Getting ready for bed.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.191
What do you think?

26:30.291 --> 26:32.092
You just, you've
been in here forever.

26:33.394 --> 26:35.696
No, I haven't.
You're just drunk.

26:37.264 --> 26:38.232
No, I'm not.

26:41.202 --> 26:42.870
So I've had a few drinks.

26:45.139 --> 26:47.141
Why don't you come in here
and take advantage of me?

26:48.075 --> 26:49.777
Bet you'd love that.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.113
Why don't you fucking
touch me anymore?

26:57.251 --> 26:58.452
I do touch you.

27:00.354 --> 27:02.022
- I touch you plenty.
- Ah, shitting me.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.724
You just don't remember
it in the morning.

27:03.824 --> 27:05.125
Not like you used to.

27:06.327 --> 27:07.328
Are we going to have

27:07.428 --> 27:08.996
one of those
conversations again?

27:11.966 --> 27:12.800
Why do you do this

27:12.967 --> 27:14.435
every time I try
to tell you how I'm feeling?

27:14.535 --> 27:16.237
Because I don't
appreciate you doing it

27:16.337 --> 27:18.038
right before we go to bed.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.107
I'm sorry, that's the
only time I have your attention.

27:20.207 --> 27:22.042
You always
have my attention.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.444
You know that.

27:23.544 --> 27:24.979
No, I don't.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.014
You're always on to Facebook

27:27.114 --> 27:29.116
or on your fucking phone
or some shit like that.

27:29.216 --> 27:31.051
And you're not
on your computer?

27:31.151 --> 27:33.087
Watching some stupid show on TV?

27:33.187 --> 27:34.788
I just miss you.

27:36.523 --> 27:37.358
Miss me?

27:38.959 --> 27:40.494
How could you miss me?

27:41.495 --> 27:44.131
You see me every single day.

27:44.465 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, but you're
always somewhere else.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.401
- I can feel it.
- No, I'm not!

27:47.935 --> 27:49.970
I'm always here with you.

27:50.938 --> 27:52.072
You know this.

27:52.873 --> 27:53.974
Doesn't feel that way.

27:57.544 --> 27:59.546
Well, it takes
two to tango, my dear.

28:00.281 --> 28:03.417
You are more than welcome
to initiate every now and then.

28:04.051 --> 28:07.087
That task shouldn't
just fall on me.

28:08.088 --> 28:10.190
I just feel like you don't
wanna be with me anymore.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.993
Why must you do this?

28:13.894 --> 28:15.029
Every night.

28:15.129 --> 28:16.497
Right before we go to bed.

28:18.265 --> 28:19.500
Of course I love you.

28:20.034 --> 28:22.436
Of course I still
want to be with you.

28:23.871 --> 28:25.205
Are you seeing someone?

28:27.441 --> 28:28.309
Are you?

28:28.575 --> 28:29.543
No.

28:30.177 --> 28:31.078
Good.

28:31.613 --> 28:32.579
Neither am I.

28:33.580 --> 28:35.049
Now let's go to bed.

28:45.326 --> 28:46.427
Would you tell me if you were?

28:46.728 --> 28:48.562
Fuck me.

28:52.933 --> 28:54.435
Are you really that insecure?

28:56.403 --> 28:57.504
Do I have to follow you around

28:57.605 --> 28:59.073
like a little lapdog,
is that it?

29:00.040 --> 29:00.908
Huh?

29:02.076 --> 29:04.111
Do I need to constantly express

29:04.211 --> 29:06.480
my undying love
and devotion to you?

29:06.580 --> 29:08.549
At every waking moment?

29:14.188 --> 29:16.357
I just need a little reassurance
every now and then.

29:26.233 --> 29:27.368
Listen to me.

29:28.703 --> 29:29.604
Okay?

29:31.606 --> 29:33.006
We had a shit year.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.878
Losing the baby,

29:38.545 --> 29:39.980
it really...

29:41.115 --> 29:42.449
really, messed me up.

29:45.352 --> 29:47.955
But that doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

29:50.391 --> 29:52.926
But would you tell me if you
were in love with someone else?

29:55.195 --> 29:57.531
Why must you always
dwell on the hypotheticals?

29:57.632 --> 29:59.166
I'm just asking.

30:03.237 --> 30:04.104
Yes.

30:04.706 --> 30:06.240
Of course. I would tell you

30:06.340 --> 30:07.675
if I was in love
with someone else,

30:07.776 --> 30:09.109
but I'm not.

30:09.611 --> 30:11.445
So it doesn't matter.

30:12.379 --> 30:13.280
Okay.

30:22.624 --> 30:24.491
I don't know
what I'd do if I lost you.

30:27.729 --> 30:29.163
You're not losing me.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.700
Now go the fuck to sleep.

31:16.310 --> 31:17.211
Ow.

31:19.781 --> 31:20.648
Fuck.

31:23.450 --> 31:24.318
Alex.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.356
Alex, what in God's name
are you doing?

31:30.792 --> 31:31.693
Plan B.

31:32.493 --> 31:33.360
What?

31:34.528 --> 31:35.562
Plan B?

31:36.129 --> 31:38.098
What the fuck does that mean?

31:38.532 --> 31:40.133
What are you doing?

31:40.902 --> 31:44.304
Plan A was you confessing
like an honest, caring person

31:44.404 --> 31:45.773
when given the chance.

31:46.340 --> 31:48.208
But you are a coward.

31:48.308 --> 31:50.612
Confessing?

31:52.312 --> 31:53.580
Confessing to what?

31:54.515 --> 31:56.183
Plan B is like Plan A,

31:56.283 --> 31:58.686
but with a little
added pressure.

31:58.786 --> 32:01.255
Honey, there is
no going back from this.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.557
I mean, seriously.

32:04.291 --> 32:06.628
What could possibly
compel you to do this?

32:06.728 --> 32:07.561
Compel me?

32:09.697 --> 32:11.298
There's no compelling argument

32:11.398 --> 32:13.467
you could give me
to rethink this.

32:13.567 --> 32:15.235
What's done, is done.

32:16.169 --> 32:17.672
Play time is officially over.

32:17.772 --> 32:20.307
You're gonna go to jail,
do you know that?

32:20.407 --> 32:21.575
We'll see.

32:22.376 --> 32:23.277
Becca.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.481
Becca, I'm so, so sorry.

32:28.650 --> 32:30.685
I don't know
why she's doing this.

32:30.785 --> 32:33.721
She's not well, she has not
been in her right mind.

32:33.821 --> 32:36.156
I should have done this
months ago.

32:36.256 --> 32:37.357
Done what?

32:38.726 --> 32:39.694
This?

32:39.794 --> 32:41.763
Nothing good can come from this!

32:42.630 --> 32:43.631
Nothing!

32:44.832 --> 32:47.067
We can't walk away from this.

32:47.167 --> 32:48.736
You understand that, don't you?

32:49.202 --> 32:51.238
You know, this might come
as a surprise to you.

32:52.707 --> 32:55.710
But I actually know
what I'm doing.

32:56.143 --> 32:58.378
You have kidnapped our neighbor.

32:58.478 --> 32:59.513
No, no.

33:00.213 --> 33:02.215
She came over here willingly.

33:02.650 --> 33:06.219
You have held
her hostage against her will.

33:08.690 --> 33:10.223
I mean, come on.

33:10.658 --> 33:13.661
It's one thing to knock out
your husband and tie him up.

33:13.761 --> 33:15.295
But a stranger?

33:15.897 --> 33:17.397
Oh, she's not a stranger.

33:17.497 --> 33:20.534
Oh, come on,
you don't mean...

33:21.201 --> 33:22.102
Fuck.

33:22.202 --> 33:23.638
And as for you,

33:24.338 --> 33:26.506
I was merely protecting myself

33:27.008 --> 33:29.811
against your violent, drunken,

33:30.177 --> 33:32.847
unwanted sexual advances.

33:33.681 --> 33:36.450
I have bruises on my legs
from when you threw me down.

33:37.250 --> 33:38.118
Baby...

33:38.452 --> 33:40.253
And you know
how easily I bruise.

33:41.956 --> 33:43.557
Baby, you need help.

33:44.257 --> 33:47.527
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

33:47.629 --> 33:48.830
I mean it.

33:50.698 --> 33:52.466
He thinks I'm crazy.

33:54.434 --> 33:56.136
But I'm sure
he told you that already, hm?

33:56.236 --> 33:57.504
Come on.

33:58.072 --> 33:59.874
There is no other
logical explanation.

33:59.974 --> 34:01.676
No rational person
would do this.

34:01.776 --> 34:03.911
Who said anything
about being rational?

34:04.344 --> 34:06.146
This is about honesty.

34:07.749 --> 34:09.349
This is about coming clean.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.855
This is about finally admitting

34:13.955 --> 34:17.224
what I know has been going on
behind my back for months.

34:18.660 --> 34:22.396
This is about fucking time.

34:25.599 --> 34:26.834
Untie us!

34:28.603 --> 34:32.439
Do not let
our problems become hers!

34:33.141 --> 34:35.475
She is innocent, and so am I!

34:38.746 --> 34:41.248
Only the truth, dear husband,

34:42.016 --> 34:43.651
will set you free.

34:46.688 --> 34:47.554
Help!

34:48.623 --> 34:50.357
Help! Help us!

34:51.693 --> 34:52.694
Somebody help!

34:53.493 --> 34:54.528
Help!

34:54.629 --> 34:55.730
Help!

34:56.764 --> 34:57.632
Mm!

34:59.033 --> 35:00.434
- Mm.
- There.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.670
That should do it for now.

35:15.282 --> 35:17.417
I'm not talking to
an empty chair again today.

35:17.785 --> 35:20.487
I am done talking to chairs
that don't have anybody in them.

35:20.888 --> 35:23.290
No worries.
There's no chair work today.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.325
It was just an exercise

35:25.425 --> 35:27.729
to help you confront Ian
and the other woman.

35:29.897 --> 35:31.565
She's real, you know?

35:31.666 --> 35:33.634
She's not just a stupid chair.

35:33.735 --> 35:35.737
She's as real as I am,
sitting here.

35:35.837 --> 35:37.872
Yeah, but your reaction
said something different.

35:37.972 --> 35:39.974
When offered the chance
to confront the woman

35:40.074 --> 35:41.809
that turns your life
upside down, you fled.

35:43.978 --> 35:45.579
It was an empty chair.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.815
Which proves my point.

35:48.515 --> 35:50.685
An empty chair
is not confrontational,

35:50.785 --> 35:52.419
it's passive at best.

35:52.519 --> 35:55.388
It's a start,
it's an introduction

35:55.489 --> 35:58.358
into you being able
to express yourself safely,

35:58.458 --> 35:59.927
but you couldn't do it.

36:00.962 --> 36:03.563
And maybe you fled because
you didn't know what to say.

36:04.899 --> 36:07.434
Maybe you fled
because you're scared,

36:07.534 --> 36:08.736
or maybe...

36:09.737 --> 36:11.873
Just maybe, you fled

36:11.973 --> 36:14.742
because you know
that she doesn't exist.

36:17.879 --> 36:19.046
She does exist.

36:20.547 --> 36:22.884
She has a name.
Do you wanna know her name?

36:23.517 --> 36:25.285
Do you wanna
know where she lives?

36:25.385 --> 36:26.553
Her favorite hobbies?

36:26.654 --> 36:27.989
Her favorite movie?

36:29.556 --> 36:31.424
<i>Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.</i>

36:33.161 --> 36:35.663
Do you know how I know that,
is fucking Facebook.

36:37.430 --> 36:38.699
I know everything about her.

36:39.801 --> 36:41.368
I know that her husband
got drunk

36:41.468 --> 36:43.771
and she fell down the stairs.

36:46.073 --> 36:48.341
Which is probably
why she lost the baby.

36:48.441 --> 36:49.977
Okay. Let's bring it back.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.813
We need to work
on your relationship.

36:51.913 --> 36:53.313
We need to focus on that.

36:53.681 --> 36:55.850
The other woman has nothing
to do with you and Ian.

36:58.619 --> 36:59.787
Dr. Collins?

37:01.521 --> 37:03.456
She is fucking my husband.

37:06.493 --> 37:09.329
Are you gonna be a good girl
if I take this thing off?

37:13.835 --> 37:16.469
Don't make me regret this.

37:23.644 --> 37:26.513
You guys are fucking insane.

37:27.014 --> 37:29.382
You hear me? Fucking insane!

37:30.550 --> 37:32.687
I am sorry that
your marriage has issues,

37:32.787 --> 37:34.689
but it has nothing
to do with me.

37:34.789 --> 37:35.790
And you?

37:35.890 --> 37:37.625
Keep your fucking voice down.

37:38.391 --> 37:39.994
You wanna wake
the entire neighborhood?

37:40.094 --> 37:42.063
My husband included.

37:42.562 --> 37:44.497
Bloody hell, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

37:44.598 --> 37:46.399
You're dead from the neck up!

37:46.734 --> 37:49.369
We were doing just fine
until you guys moved in.

37:49.971 --> 37:53.540
We have been nothing
but good neighbors to you.

37:53.641 --> 37:55.442
And this is how you repay us.

37:56.110 --> 37:57.912
- I was a friend to you.
- A friend?

37:58.012 --> 37:58.679
- Yes!
- Really?

37:59.013 --> 38:01.548
Through everything,
and everyone screamed

38:01.649 --> 38:02.817
that you were a total nutter.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.719
I went against
my better judgment.

38:04.819 --> 38:08.723
And this stellar judgment
felt it was perfectly okay

38:08.823 --> 38:10.024
for you to sleep
with my husband.

38:10.124 --> 38:12.894
I'm not sleeping
with your husband.

38:13.361 --> 38:15.595
You really think
I would lower myself

38:15.696 --> 38:17.530
to sleep
with this little dickweed?

38:18.933 --> 38:20.902
Oh, grow up, you baby.

38:21.002 --> 38:24.571
As for you, you are so fucked.

38:25.273 --> 38:27.975
Prosecution is gonna be
the least of your concerns

38:28.075 --> 38:29.442
when I am done with you.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.444
Oh, it really
doesn't matter what I do.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.481
So I broke a few laws.

38:34.581 --> 38:36.851
Tied you to a chair
and bruised your ego.

38:36.951 --> 38:38.418
The public will be on my side.

38:38.518 --> 38:40.988
I have never touched
your husband.

38:41.856 --> 38:43.456
Has he ever touched you?

38:43.925 --> 38:45.126
Because I am perfectly willing

38:45.226 --> 38:46.627
to get down to
the dirty semantics

38:46.727 --> 38:48.963
of what really went on,
if that's what it takes.

38:49.063 --> 38:50.197
So how did he do it?

38:51.232 --> 38:52.733
Was it oral?

38:52.833 --> 38:54.001
Or did you give him
the good old-fashioned?

38:54.101 --> 38:54.936
Fuck you.

38:55.736 --> 38:58.039
I don't know what the bloody
hell is going on here.

38:58.139 --> 39:01.574
But I have never done
anything with your husband.

39:01.676 --> 39:03.911
Or any other husband,
for that matter.

39:04.011 --> 39:06.047
Then why did you come
running over here

39:06.147 --> 39:07.648
after I sent
that text from his phone?

39:07.748 --> 39:09.684
It was
a cryptic message!

39:09.784 --> 39:10.885
I thought something was wrong!

39:10.985 --> 39:11.986
You thought
something was wrong.

39:12.086 --> 39:12.920
Yes!

39:13.354 --> 39:15.156
Of course something was wrong.

39:15.256 --> 39:17.858
His wife finally put
two and two together.

39:19.526 --> 39:21.662
Or did you think
it was an intruder?

39:23.064 --> 39:24.564
Or the house was on fire?

39:25.866 --> 39:27.101
Were you just being neighborly?

39:27.201 --> 39:28.102
Is that it?

39:29.770 --> 39:31.105
It was late,
I must have misread it.

39:31.205 --> 39:32.239
I don't know!

39:39.146 --> 39:40.513
"We need to talk.

39:40.781 --> 39:42.116
I think she's on to us.

39:42.216 --> 39:44.819
Can you come over?
She just left for a drive."

39:44.919 --> 39:46.120
I was half-asleep
when I read that.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.755
Half-asleep?

39:47.855 --> 39:48.689
Yes.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.225
I must have misread it.
You know how it is.

39:51.325 --> 39:53.627
Actually, I don't. Try again.

39:55.296 --> 39:56.897
I thought it was meant
for someone else.

39:56.998 --> 39:58.099
Like who?

39:58.199 --> 40:00.001
An old coworker? His mom?

40:00.101 --> 40:00.868
I don't bloody know.

40:00.968 --> 40:02.670
I just know
it wasn't meant for me.

40:02.770 --> 40:03.738
Wow.

40:05.106 --> 40:08.009
You are both terrible liars.

40:08.109 --> 40:08.776
It's the truth!

40:09.043 --> 40:10.778
You're practically
made for each other.

40:10.878 --> 40:12.246
Okay, I'll admit it.

40:12.346 --> 40:13.280
It sounded strange,

40:13.447 --> 40:15.916
but it wasn't out of
the realm of possibilities.

40:16.317 --> 40:18.252
"Can you come over?
We need to talk."

40:18.352 --> 40:19.920
How is that a possibility?

40:20.021 --> 40:21.655
I thought it was meant
for someone else.

40:21.756 --> 40:23.758
Mm, you said that already.
It's a weak excuse. Try again.

40:23.858 --> 40:25.760
But it's the truth!

40:26.861 --> 40:28.129
Did you know
he was having an affair?

40:28.229 --> 40:29.096
No.

40:29.764 --> 40:32.700
So you didn't put it past him
when you got the text from him?

40:32.800 --> 40:33.934
Maybe.

40:36.704 --> 40:37.638
So in your head...

40:38.105 --> 40:39.240
Ian is having an affair,

40:40.074 --> 40:40.975
his wife is on to it...

40:41.541 --> 40:43.811
And this text
wasn't meant for me.

40:43.911 --> 40:45.613
So I'll just run over
and correct the mistake,

40:45.713 --> 40:47.648
- is that what you're telling me?
- Yes.

40:48.349 --> 40:50.317
Then
why didn't you tell me?

40:50.418 --> 40:52.086
I thought
we were friends, Becca.

40:52.620 --> 40:54.554
Wouldn't you want
your friend to tell you

40:54.655 --> 40:55.923
if they got
a cryptic text message

40:56.023 --> 40:57.892
from their husband that
was meant for another woman?

40:57.992 --> 40:59.860
I was tired. I wasn't thinking.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.062
Bullshit.

41:02.296 --> 41:03.230
If you were so tired,

41:03.330 --> 41:04.131
why didn't you just reply with,

41:04.231 --> 41:05.866
"What the fuck?"
and go back to bed?

41:05.966 --> 41:07.668
Why'd you come
running over here?

41:09.670 --> 41:12.073
Because my husband
monitors my phone.

41:13.707 --> 41:15.843
He would read that text
and think the worst.

41:15.943 --> 41:17.344
So your husband
doesn't trust you?

41:17.577 --> 41:18.546
We've been having issues.

41:18.712 --> 41:20.614
Well, there must be some reason
for him to think that.

41:20.714 --> 41:22.616
I have never cheated on him!

41:24.051 --> 41:25.619
Oh. Nate's calling.

41:26.821 --> 41:28.789
He's called, like,
eight times in the past hour.

41:28.889 --> 41:30.758
He must really be trying
to get a hold of you.

41:31.292 --> 41:33.593
Oh, God, that means he's
been awake this entire time.

41:33.694 --> 41:35.062
Good. Well, if he's awake,
let's invite him over.

41:35.162 --> 41:35.963
- No.
- We can have a real

41:36.063 --> 41:38.099
- heart to heart.
- No. No, please don't.

41:38.199 --> 41:39.633
Please.

41:39.733 --> 41:40.601
Please!

41:41.168 --> 41:42.236
Don't.

41:43.571 --> 41:46.340
You don't understand how jealous
he can get. He'll kill me.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.609
I swear it, he will kill us all.

41:50.277 --> 41:52.113
I thought
you said you were innocent.

41:52.213 --> 41:54.215
Doesn't matter
what's true or not.

41:54.682 --> 41:56.684
He will walk in here, see this,

41:56.784 --> 41:58.686
and assume the worst,
just like you did.

42:09.063 --> 42:10.698
Promise to keep your voice down.

42:12.933 --> 42:14.869
I don't think you realize

42:14.969 --> 42:17.638
how completely fucked we are
because of you.

43:03.751 --> 43:06.053
We have no idea
what he is capable of doing.

43:06.453 --> 43:07.488
He is drunk,

43:07.721 --> 43:11.358
he is jealous, and he is awake,
wondering where his wife is.

43:11.759 --> 43:14.128
Just a matter of time
before he comes over here.

43:15.329 --> 43:17.031
That's your problem, not mine.

43:17.131 --> 43:18.732
He has a gun.

43:19.166 --> 43:21.802
He could kill us all.
He's completely unhinged.

43:22.536 --> 43:23.404
And I'm not?

43:24.004 --> 43:26.774
You might be a lot of things,
but I know you.

43:26.874 --> 43:29.109
You are not capable
of doing that.

43:30.244 --> 43:31.145
You don't know that.

43:31.245 --> 43:33.747
What the fuck is wrong with you?

43:35.382 --> 43:36.850
You said so yourself.

43:37.652 --> 43:39.954
Who knows
what I'm capable of doing

43:40.054 --> 43:42.957
under the duress
of my husband's infidelity.

43:43.357 --> 43:45.025
This isn't a game.

43:45.125 --> 43:46.460
There are lives at stake here.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.561
Innocent lives.

43:47.728 --> 43:49.797
Now, whatever you think
might have happened, doesn't...

43:49.897 --> 43:50.998
"Might have happened?"

43:52.066 --> 43:53.467
There are consequences here.

43:54.001 --> 43:56.203
Yeah.
Severe fucking consequences.

43:56.303 --> 43:57.338
Bingo.

43:58.906 --> 43:59.840
Okay.

44:01.041 --> 44:01.909
So that's it.

44:03.244 --> 44:04.745
You are willing
to live with this,

44:04.845 --> 44:06.480
- despite what might happen.
- No.

44:07.815 --> 44:09.783
I'm not willing
to live a second longer

44:09.883 --> 44:11.051
until you finally come clean

44:11.151 --> 44:12.753
about what I know
you've been doing.

44:13.821 --> 44:15.022
If that was true,

44:15.522 --> 44:17.424
then we need physical evidence,
don't we?

44:17.524 --> 44:19.326
We'd have lots of it,
phone records, texts,

44:19.426 --> 44:20.060
- emails...
- Correct.

44:20.261 --> 44:21.462
- Video...
- Okay.

44:21.562 --> 44:22.529
- Here. Here.
- Records.

44:22.631 --> 44:24.164
I record him every night.

44:24.265 --> 44:26.233
- No, I'm not gonna do that.
- Just play it!

44:26.333 --> 44:27.534
- Play it.
- Your destructive behavior

44:27.636 --> 44:28.637
and paranoia has got to stop.

44:28.737 --> 44:30.971
I pay you two hundred
and fifty dollars an hour,

44:31.071 --> 44:32.539
now play the fucking clip!

44:32.641 --> 44:33.974
I have heard it.

44:35.943 --> 44:37.411
It's white noise.

44:40.147 --> 44:41.015
You win.

44:44.184 --> 44:45.252
I had an affair.

44:46.053 --> 44:47.121
But it wasn't with her.

44:47.756 --> 44:48.522
It was with someone else.

44:48.723 --> 44:50.858
It was months ago,
it didn't mean anything,

44:50.958 --> 44:52.426
and I'm really sorry.

44:53.527 --> 44:54.828
Who was it?

44:54.928 --> 44:56.130
I don't remember her name.

44:56.230 --> 44:57.298
It was a one-night thing.

44:57.398 --> 44:58.565
It didn't matter.

44:59.634 --> 45:01.001
- Where'd you meet?
- Online.

45:01.101 --> 45:03.103
Online where?
Craigslist? Ashley Madison?

45:03.203 --> 45:04.338
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

45:04.438 --> 45:05.406
I gave you what you wanted.

45:05.506 --> 45:07.474
- Gave me?
- Now untie her

45:07.574 --> 45:10.110
and let us go before
someone really gets hurt.

45:10.811 --> 45:14.281
You really are an asshole,
you know that?

45:14.381 --> 45:16.150
I gave you what you wanted!

45:16.250 --> 45:18.352
You expect me to believe that?

45:18.452 --> 45:20.587
Oh my God, what
is wrong with you people?

45:21.422 --> 45:22.489
Get help!

45:22.791 --> 45:24.425
Get counseling, get medication,

45:24.525 --> 45:26.427
get something,
but leave me out of it.

45:27.494 --> 45:30.964
I'm sorry that you two have
such piss-poor communications,

45:31.065 --> 45:32.366
'cause honestly, I am,

45:32.466 --> 45:34.335
but this situation
has nothing to do with me.

45:34.435 --> 45:35.269
It's true.

45:35.369 --> 45:37.004
Shut up and let me finish!

45:39.139 --> 45:41.041
You pulled me into this mess.

45:41.375 --> 45:44.211
A mess that
I had nothing to do with.

45:44.311 --> 45:47.348
And now my life and my marriage
are at stake because of it.

45:48.415 --> 45:50.317
Can't you see what you've done?

45:52.386 --> 45:55.522
This can't simply be fixed
or forgotten.

45:58.225 --> 45:59.593
Look, I am sorry

45:59.694 --> 46:02.196
that your husband
is such an arsehole.

46:03.130 --> 46:04.365
Honestly, I am.

46:04.465 --> 46:07.568
But, please, try and put
yourself in my shoes.

46:08.402 --> 46:10.270
I don't belong here.

46:10.371 --> 46:12.005
I didn't do anything.

46:14.942 --> 46:17.945
Whatever happens tonight
to your marriage,

46:18.045 --> 46:20.347
happens, that is
for you two to figure out.

46:20.914 --> 46:21.982
But just know that my life

46:22.216 --> 46:25.953
and my marriage will never be
the same again because of you.

46:27.388 --> 46:31.058
Even when I press charges
and you go to jail,

46:31.158 --> 46:34.561
and I sue you for
every last dime that you have,

46:34.662 --> 46:36.497
it will not erase the fact

46:36.597 --> 46:39.366
that you wrongfully
put me into your fantasy.

46:41.770 --> 46:45.339
You have singlehandedly
given me a death sentence.

46:46.306 --> 46:47.975
So thank you!

46:49.176 --> 46:51.512
Thank you for ruining my life.

46:54.248 --> 46:55.115
Okay.

46:55.717 --> 46:57.484
You guys, it's not too late.

46:57.752 --> 46:59.687
Okay, we can move on from this.

46:59.788 --> 47:00.421
We can.

47:00.789 --> 47:03.557
We just need to come up
with an explanation.

47:03.858 --> 47:06.994
Or an alibi
to explain what happened,

47:07.094 --> 47:09.062
so that way,
it's not just Becca's word.

47:09.697 --> 47:11.198
Listen to me.

47:12.232 --> 47:16.570
We need to agree to never
talk about this, ever again.

47:17.438 --> 47:19.373
What do you say, Becca?

47:20.207 --> 47:22.276
You willing to forget
this whole thing ever happened?

47:22.376 --> 47:23.577
Well, she'd have to.

47:23.678 --> 47:24.578
Because it's the only way

47:24.679 --> 47:27.114
she's gonna walk away
from this unscathed.

47:29.216 --> 47:30.551
Looks like
you're in a pickle, my dear.

47:30.652 --> 47:31.719
Oh, fuck you.

47:31.820 --> 47:33.420
We all are,
if we don't solve this.

47:35.189 --> 47:37.291
I'm not looking
to solve anything.

47:37.391 --> 47:38.392
I didn't do anything.

47:38.492 --> 47:41.595
I simply want answers.

47:43.497 --> 47:44.431
I didn't do anything.

47:44.531 --> 47:45.966
I know you have.

47:46.366 --> 47:49.203
Have I ever done anything
to make you not believe me?

47:51.806 --> 47:54.107
You talk in your sleep.

47:54.208 --> 47:56.376
Such bullshit.

47:56.744 --> 47:59.046
Hang on, wait a second.

48:01.181 --> 48:03.718
All of this is
because he talks in his sleep?

48:05.319 --> 48:08.255
It's what he says in his sleep.

48:10.123 --> 48:11.759
Are you fucking serious?

48:12.493 --> 48:15.429
My entire life
has been turned upside down

48:15.529 --> 48:18.733
because you think
you heard something?

48:21.535 --> 48:23.403
Do you think
I wanted this to happen?

48:24.471 --> 48:25.506
Do you know how many nights

48:25.607 --> 48:27.074
I've laid next to him in bed

48:27.174 --> 48:29.243
while he talks
about fucking you?

48:33.280 --> 48:35.215
Do you know
how many times I told myself,

48:35.315 --> 48:37.284
"No. It's nothing.

48:37.384 --> 48:39.152
It's just a dream.

48:39.253 --> 48:42.456
It has nothing to do with you
or her...

48:45.292 --> 48:46.628
or anyone.

48:46.728 --> 48:48.362
It just is."

48:54.736 --> 48:58.171
Do you know how many times
I've gone into the closet

48:58.272 --> 49:00.173
and held the gun to my head,

49:00.274 --> 49:02.543
wishing and hoping
it would all go away.

49:08.983 --> 49:12.654
I've done everything I can
to try to make sense of this.

49:14.154 --> 49:15.723
I've done more research
on sleep talking

49:15.823 --> 49:17.659
than I care to admit.

49:17.759 --> 49:20.662
And yet, no one believes me.

49:21.495 --> 49:23.363
I'm the crazy one.

49:24.666 --> 49:26.400
I've checked his phone.

49:26.801 --> 49:30.605
His internet history, I even
followed him to run errands.

49:31.371 --> 49:33.608
And what I've discovered
in all of this...

49:38.512 --> 49:41.783
For all intents and purposes,
he is clean.

49:43.584 --> 49:45.720
Then why can't you let this go?

49:45.820 --> 49:46.854
Because you won't admit

49:46.955 --> 49:48.488
what I know
in my heart to be true.

49:48.589 --> 49:51.726
Oh my God, fuck your heart!

49:55.697 --> 49:57.564
For the last time,

49:57.665 --> 49:59.867
I didn't do anything.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.605
And if I did, do you really...

50:04.304 --> 50:06.874
do you really think
it'd be with her?

50:07.909 --> 50:09.142
Huh?

50:09.242 --> 50:09.877
Really?

50:12.312 --> 50:13.848
I'm sorry. You honestly think

50:13.948 --> 50:16.216
that I would let this stupid
fucker's dick anywhere near me?

50:16.316 --> 50:17.517
Okay.

50:17.619 --> 50:19.219
So now I'm a stupid fucker.

50:19.319 --> 50:20.187
Well, listen, bitch.

50:20.554 --> 50:22.690
I'm not the only one with
a spouse who has trust issues.

50:22.790 --> 50:24.591
Oh, fuck you! Go to hell!

50:24.692 --> 50:25.559
Okay.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.862
No, do you know
what would really be awesome?

50:27.962 --> 50:31.365
If Nate came over here
and joined in the conversation.

50:31.465 --> 50:34.201
I would sure love to hear
what he has to say about you.

50:40.041 --> 50:41.508
Why did you leave
all the lights on?

50:41.609 --> 50:42.810
- Ian?
- He can't know

50:42.910 --> 50:44.646
that I'm here.

50:50.118 --> 50:51.753
Ian, it's Nate!

51:01.629 --> 51:02.496
It's Nate.

51:10.838 --> 51:12.506
Nate...

51:12.807 --> 51:14.776
What are you doing here?
What time is it?

51:14.876 --> 51:16.611
Sorry to wake you.

51:17.344 --> 51:20.748
Is Ian home? I just...
I need to talk to him.

51:21.883 --> 51:24.351
No, he's not here.

51:25.620 --> 51:26.621
What do you mean, he's not here?

51:26.721 --> 51:29.791
We got into a fight earlier.

51:30.524 --> 51:31.726
Then he left.

51:33.260 --> 51:35.529
Oh. Where'd he go?

51:35.963 --> 51:37.464
I don't know.

51:38.866 --> 51:39.801
I'm sorry. I...

51:39.901 --> 51:42.302
I took a sleeping pill,
I'm a little out of it.

51:44.438 --> 51:45.707
So can I come in?

51:47.307 --> 51:48.341
Yep.

51:54.347 --> 51:56.283
- What's this all about?
- Where is he?

51:56.383 --> 51:57.952
I told you already,
he's not here.

51:58.052 --> 51:58.953
His car's here.

52:00.755 --> 52:02.690
I don't know.
Maybe he went for a walk.

52:02.790 --> 52:04.257
At this hour?

52:04.625 --> 52:05.492
Yeah.

52:06.027 --> 52:06.961
He's done it before.

52:07.061 --> 52:08.428
I told you we got into a fight

52:08.528 --> 52:09.831
- and he left.
- Yeah, I see.

52:10.698 --> 52:11.431
I saw him.

52:11.531 --> 52:12.967
Earlier, we had
a drink together,

52:13.067 --> 52:14.434
and then I saw him come home.

52:15.002 --> 52:16.236
I don't know.

52:16.336 --> 52:17.739
Your guess is as good as mine.

52:18.706 --> 52:19.741
Ian!

52:20.373 --> 52:21.308
Ian!

52:21.408 --> 52:22.076
- Nate.
- Ian!

52:22.710 --> 52:23.911
Where are you going? You can't
just barge in here like this.

52:24.612 --> 52:25.479
Nate.

52:25.579 --> 52:26.714
What's going on?

52:27.014 --> 52:28.015
I heard voices.

52:28.683 --> 52:29.684
Voices.

52:29.784 --> 52:30.517
One.

52:30.785 --> 52:32.653
When I was outside,
I heard people talking.

52:34.387 --> 52:35.388
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

52:35.522 --> 52:38.425
I was sleeping when you
started banging on the door.

52:38.693 --> 52:40.628
It's a miracle I even woke up.

52:43.330 --> 52:44.799
What were you guys
fighting about?

52:46.033 --> 52:48.301
- Same shit, different day.
- Just tell me.

52:49.670 --> 52:51.271
Married people fight.

52:51.371 --> 52:52.774
That's just a fact of life.

52:54.374 --> 52:55.442
Thought you guys were happy.

52:56.443 --> 52:57.645
What does that even mean?

52:58.112 --> 52:59.013
I love him.

52:59.714 --> 53:00.681
He loves me.

53:01.182 --> 53:03.517
Comfort. Security.

53:04.085 --> 53:05.452
History together.

53:07.622 --> 53:08.990
All of us have baggage.

53:09.624 --> 53:12.059
Marriage is just
a matter of figuring out

53:12.160 --> 53:13.828
what bags go together,

53:13.928 --> 53:15.663
and which bags go where.

53:19.033 --> 53:20.835
Have you ever been cheated on?

53:24.906 --> 53:27.474
I had a string of asshole
boyfriends in high school.

53:27.574 --> 53:28.575
As an adult.

53:32.079 --> 53:32.947
No.

53:40.487 --> 53:41.923
I think Becca is seeing someone.

53:42.857 --> 53:43.624
Nate.

53:43.858 --> 53:45.827
And I think
that person is your husband.

53:50.031 --> 53:50.898
Nate.

53:52.399 --> 53:53.400
Nate.

53:56.469 --> 53:57.337
Nate.

53:59.974 --> 54:00.875
What?

54:09.917 --> 54:11.351
I'm sorry.

54:41.682 --> 54:42.549
Look at you.

54:43.818 --> 54:45.887
Just sitting there
with nowhere to go.

54:47.054 --> 54:50.858
You're mine now, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

54:57.965 --> 54:58.833
Can you...

55:00.001 --> 55:01.534
feel your hands?

55:02.970 --> 55:04.672
Did I tie them too tight?

55:07.708 --> 55:08.609
Or...

55:09.143 --> 55:11.812
That's right. You can't talk,

55:12.346 --> 55:14.115
because I gagged you.

55:15.616 --> 55:18.019
I can do or say whatever I want,

55:18.518 --> 55:22.623
and you just have to sit there
and take it.

55:26.260 --> 55:27.094
Wow.

55:27.460 --> 55:29.730
This is what it
must be like to be God.

55:30.898 --> 55:32.199
Just to have complete

55:32.300 --> 55:34.969
and total control over someone.

55:36.103 --> 55:37.738
Kinda like you do to me.

55:38.306 --> 55:40.741
Maybe we should put this off.

56:04.265 --> 56:05.166
What?

56:05.633 --> 56:06.934
Please.

56:07.802 --> 56:08.669
Baby.

56:09.036 --> 56:10.671
This can't keep going on.

56:11.605 --> 56:13.174
This is not gonna end well.

56:13.941 --> 56:15.977
That depends.
Are you ready to talk?

56:16.877 --> 56:18.079
He's gonna come back.

56:18.713 --> 56:20.982
He's not gonna give up,
and when he does,

56:21.082 --> 56:21.949
he's gonna find us.

56:22.049 --> 56:22.984
And he's gonna kill us all.

56:23.084 --> 56:23.951
Talk.

56:24.352 --> 56:26.153
You've never even shot
that thing.

56:26.253 --> 56:28.055
There is no telling

56:28.155 --> 56:30.157
what Nate would do
in a drunken rage.

56:32.994 --> 56:35.896
You're a good, honest person,

56:35.997 --> 56:38.065
who has been pushed
to the brink.

56:38.366 --> 56:40.801
- Because of you.
- Baby.

56:41.435 --> 56:43.570
Jesus fucking Christ!

56:44.905 --> 56:46.173
Let's get something straight.

56:46.674 --> 56:48.676
I may have been pushed
to the brink,

56:48.776 --> 56:50.811
but don't fool yourself
for a second

56:50.911 --> 56:52.913
thinking I'm any less
of a threat than he is.

56:54.115 --> 56:55.850
That's nice, seeing
you two together like this.

56:56.851 --> 56:59.687
Especially after hearing
your exploits for so long.

57:01.856 --> 57:02.857
Hm.

57:07.828 --> 57:10.931
I wonder what I'd do with you.

57:12.199 --> 57:13.067
Or to you.

57:14.135 --> 57:15.036
Torture?

57:15.836 --> 57:18.606
Nah. Nah.
You're too good for that.

57:19.273 --> 57:20.908
That's too good for you.

57:23.744 --> 57:25.646
Kinda like to see you
squirm a little bit.

57:27.915 --> 57:29.617
Maybe I could invite...

57:31.318 --> 57:32.987
your husband over.

57:35.790 --> 57:37.324
I bet he'd like to see this.

57:38.626 --> 57:40.795
Yeah. Or what?

57:42.063 --> 57:46.100
Oh, you're worried that
he would do something

57:46.200 --> 57:48.169
when he found out
about you and my husband?

57:50.704 --> 57:53.174
Wow, he has a crazy temper too.

57:53.741 --> 57:54.742
Alex.

58:00.181 --> 58:01.849
I might not hurt you.

58:06.954 --> 58:07.955
Or maybe...

58:12.893 --> 58:15.863
I could blow
your fucking head off.

58:17.264 --> 58:18.766
Look. Okay.

58:19.033 --> 58:20.267
All right. Let's... We're done.

58:25.940 --> 58:27.608
I'm gonna go outside.

58:28.676 --> 58:30.377
And give you two some privacy.

58:32.947 --> 58:36.650
I suggest you use this time
to get your stories straight.

58:38.185 --> 58:42.289
I expect to hear something
more worthwhile when I get back.

58:43.057 --> 58:44.191
Alex.

58:46.427 --> 58:48.362
I forgive you for doing this.

58:51.165 --> 58:53.234
I know what drove you
to do this.

58:54.301 --> 58:55.936
But I don't blame you.

58:58.105 --> 59:00.841
But we're not past
the point of no return, okay?

59:01.842 --> 59:02.910
We can move on.

59:04.044 --> 59:06.380
We can still have a life.
Together.

59:09.150 --> 59:11.218
I love you. Alex.

59:12.786 --> 59:13.687
I always have.

59:15.289 --> 59:18.392
I have never once doubted you,

59:18.492 --> 59:20.027
or what we have.

59:21.328 --> 59:24.265
And I know there have been times

59:24.633 --> 59:26.767
when I didn't deserve you.

59:29.170 --> 59:31.672
So I understand
why you're doing this.

59:31.772 --> 59:33.841
I really, honestly do!

59:35.776 --> 59:40.347
But do you have any idea
how much guilt I've had

59:40.447 --> 59:42.349
over the past...

59:44.451 --> 59:47.087
I feel guilty every fucking day.

59:48.789 --> 59:50.958
And yet I don't even know why.

59:52.860 --> 59:54.862
Because I didn't do anything.

59:57.264 --> 59:59.700
Do you think
I wanna say those things?

1:00:00.134 --> 1:00:02.403
Do you think
I wanna talk in my sleep?

1:00:04.405 --> 1:00:05.973
I hate myself.

1:00:09.510 --> 1:00:11.946
I hate myself because I do.

1:00:13.347 --> 1:00:16.750
And I hate myself
because I know!

1:00:18.552 --> 1:00:21.222
I know how much
this hurts you.

1:00:31.465 --> 1:00:33.200
Funny thing is,

1:00:33.300 --> 1:00:36.070
you know, I don't even
know if I say anything!

1:00:37.238 --> 1:00:38.339
You know?

1:00:38.439 --> 1:00:39.473
I mean, you say I do.

1:00:39.674 --> 1:00:43.944
But there's actually been
no concrete proof whatsoever.

1:00:46.447 --> 1:00:48.415
You realize that, don't you?

1:00:49.850 --> 1:00:53.087
I'm powerless to do anything,

1:00:54.421 --> 1:00:56.190
and so are you.

1:00:57.258 --> 1:00:59.260
I mean, Jesus Christ,

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:02.796
this thing is absolutely
fucking insane!

1:01:05.933 --> 1:01:06.834
Alex.

1:01:10.571 --> 1:01:12.940
Do you know that

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:16.277
a few months ago,
I actually went out...

1:01:18.846 --> 1:01:20.914
and I almost did something
with someone.

1:01:22.283 --> 1:01:23.550
Because I actually
wanted to have

1:01:23.652 --> 1:01:25.386
something to confess to.

1:01:26.153 --> 1:01:28.188
Because I knew
how much you needed that.

1:01:31.091 --> 1:01:32.359
And why didn't you?

1:01:34.028 --> 1:01:36.263
Because cheatings not in my DNA.

1:01:37.298 --> 1:01:38.499
It's not who I am!

1:01:45.239 --> 1:01:46.407
It's not who I am.

1:02:18.505 --> 1:02:20.140
<i>Have you tried recording it?</i>

1:02:20.541 --> 1:02:21.909
<i>Yes.</i>

1:02:22.309 --> 1:02:24.278
<i>And it never sounds the same.</i>

1:02:24.378 --> 1:02:26.880
<i>Because of that stupid sound
machine that you bought me.</i>

1:02:27.181 --> 1:02:28.616
<i>We got it to help
Alex sleep at night.</i>

1:02:28.717 --> 1:02:30.217
<i>Yeah, some help that was.</i>

1:03:27.975 --> 1:03:30.144
Sit still,
she's going to see you.

1:03:30.244 --> 1:03:32.012
We have to get out of this, now.

1:03:32.112 --> 1:03:33.981
- No point, she's got a gun.
- So does Nate.

1:03:34.381 --> 1:03:35.482
Why are you so scared?

1:03:35.582 --> 1:03:37.017
- Where is your phone?
- I don't know.

1:03:37.117 --> 1:03:38.653
We have to get the phone
and call the cops now.

1:03:38.753 --> 1:03:40.287
- No.
- Becca, listen to me.

1:03:40.722 --> 1:03:41.388
We have to call the cops.

1:03:41.955 --> 1:03:42.891
It is the only chance we have
to get out of this alive.

1:03:43.090 --> 1:03:46.226
If we call the cops,
then Nate will know I was here.

1:03:46.326 --> 1:03:47.995
He cannot know I was here.

1:03:48.095 --> 1:03:49.129
One way or another, Becca,

1:03:49.229 --> 1:03:50.531
our lives are gonna
change forever.

1:03:50.632 --> 1:03:52.433
Either she's gonna kill us,
or Nate will.

1:03:52.533 --> 1:03:54.034
We have to stop that.

1:03:54.368 --> 1:03:57.304
There is no going back
to a normal life after this.

1:03:57.672 --> 1:04:00.608
Now listen, I am sorry
that you got dragged into this.

1:04:00.708 --> 1:04:02.677
It should never have happened.

1:04:02.777 --> 1:04:05.345
I am so sorry, but we have
to face the inevitable.

1:04:05.446 --> 1:04:08.048
Either we get to the phone
or we're as good as dead.

1:04:37.110 --> 1:04:38.545
<i>Where is she?</i>

1:04:39.747 --> 1:04:41.281
<i>Is she home?</i>

1:04:41.649 --> 1:04:43.016
<i>No.</i>

1:04:44.284 --> 1:04:45.653
<i>No, come in.</i>

1:04:48.188 --> 1:04:49.089
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:04:52.827 --> 1:04:54.161
<i>Stay.</i>

1:04:54.261 --> 1:04:56.096
<i>Stay here, she doesn't know.</i>

1:04:59.132 --> 1:05:00.300
<i>There you are.</i>

1:05:02.402 --> 1:05:04.338
<i>Oh God, you're so hot.</i>

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:07.642
<i>You're so hot.</i>

1:05:08.743 --> 1:05:10.010
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

1:05:10.477 --> 1:05:12.112
<i>What do you want?</i>

1:05:13.848 --> 1:05:14.716
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:05:16.416 --> 1:05:17.584
<i>Fuck, yes.</i>

1:05:20.822 --> 1:05:23.090
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

1:05:26.193 --> 1:05:27.094
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:05:27.194 --> 1:05:28.028
<i>Fuck me.</i>

1:05:29.296 --> 1:05:31.164
<i>Fuck me, yes.</i>

1:05:34.636 --> 1:05:35.803
<i>Fuck me.</i>

1:05:37.504 --> 1:05:38.405
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:05:39.741 --> 1:05:40.642
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:05:46.814 --> 1:05:47.649
<i>Fuck.</i>

1:05:49.784 --> 1:05:51.385
<i>God, you're so fucking hot.</i>

1:05:54.856 --> 1:05:57.157
<i>You're so fucking hot.</i>

1:05:57.625 --> 1:05:59.493
<i>Are you all right?
You'll be all right. Trust me.</i>

1:06:00.427 --> 1:06:01.328
<i>Yes.</i>

1:06:01.428 --> 1:06:02.296
<i>I'm here.</i>

1:06:03.463 --> 1:06:04.799
<i>Yes.</i>

1:06:04.899 --> 1:06:05.833
<i>Breathe.</i>

1:06:08.435 --> 1:06:09.536
<i>Fuck, yes.</i>

1:06:11.138 --> 1:06:11.806
<i>Breathe.</i>

1:06:12.573 --> 1:06:13.507
<i>Breathe.</i>

1:06:17.879 --> 1:06:19.079
<i>Good.</i>

1:06:23.350 --> 1:06:25.285
I think my husband
is having an affair.

1:06:29.289 --> 1:06:30.591
I'm so sorry.

1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:34.595
I don't know
what to say to that.

1:06:35.529 --> 1:06:37.164
Is something wrong with me?

1:06:37.699 --> 1:06:38.800
No.

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:40.802
No, there's nothing wrong
with you.

1:06:40.902 --> 1:06:42.637
You just fell in love
with the wrong person.

1:06:43.071 --> 1:06:44.538
<i>That's all.</i>

1:06:47.976 --> 1:06:49.644
Happens all the time, actually.

1:06:49.744 --> 1:06:50.678
It happened to me.

1:06:51.846 --> 1:06:53.213
<i>But you'll be okay.</i>

1:07:03.791 --> 1:07:04.892
What's your name?

1:07:07.527 --> 1:07:08.395
Brian.

1:07:09.296 --> 1:07:10.197
I'm Alex.

1:07:22.644 --> 1:07:24.612
Becca?
Can you reach my hand?

1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:27.180
Told you.

1:07:28.448 --> 1:07:30.217
I can barely move my hand.

1:07:30.317 --> 1:07:32.185
I'm trying.

1:07:45.667 --> 1:07:47.935
Alex. Baby.

1:07:48.736 --> 1:07:50.203
Please.

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:53.775
I need you to listen
to me right now.

1:07:55.242 --> 1:07:56.711
But that's the thing.

1:07:56.811 --> 1:07:57.745
I do listen.

1:07:58.780 --> 1:07:59.914
I do.

1:08:00.347 --> 1:08:02.482
I listen to you
every goddamn night.

1:08:03.151 --> 1:08:05.552
I listen to you fucking her
in your sleep.

1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:07.655
You are imagining this.

1:08:08.555 --> 1:08:09.924
For the last time,

1:08:10.024 --> 1:08:11.793
this is all in your head, Alex.

1:08:11.893 --> 1:08:13.828
You have trained
yourself to hear

1:08:13.928 --> 1:08:15.797
only what you wanna hear.

1:08:16.898 --> 1:08:18.231
Fuck you.

1:08:20.034 --> 1:08:21.268
So I snore.

1:08:22.569 --> 1:08:25.305
Big fucking deal,
buy some ear plugs, okay?

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:26.473
Alex!

1:08:28.408 --> 1:08:29.911
Alex, please.

1:08:30.444 --> 1:08:31.813
Please put the gun down.

1:08:34.581 --> 1:08:36.718
This is a roleplay exercise.

1:08:36.818 --> 1:08:40.487
It's not some warped-out fantasy
for you to work your way out of.

1:08:47.594 --> 1:08:50.597
Sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

1:08:50.698 --> 1:08:52.566
I haven't slept in weeks.

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.468
What are their names?

1:08:54.568 --> 1:08:55.368
What?

1:08:55.803 --> 1:08:58.873
The woman you think is having
an affair and her husband.

1:08:58.973 --> 1:09:00.373
What are their names?

1:09:02.342 --> 1:09:03.945
Why does it matter?
You don't believe me anyway.

1:09:04.045 --> 1:09:05.713
Oh, it doesn't matter
whether I believe you.

1:09:05.813 --> 1:09:07.481
Anyway, that's not the issue.

1:09:07.581 --> 1:09:08.683
I'm here to listen to you

1:09:08.783 --> 1:09:10.752
and to help you
work this thing out.

1:09:11.919 --> 1:09:12.887
You have.

1:09:12.987 --> 1:09:14.822
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1:09:15.790 --> 1:09:16.824
I do.

1:09:16.924 --> 1:09:17.959
That's why
I think it's important

1:09:18.059 --> 1:09:19.894
that you tell me the names.

1:09:19.994 --> 1:09:22.596
It's for you, so you can
meet this problem head-on.

1:09:23.931 --> 1:09:25.365
That shut you up, didn't it?

1:09:32.807 --> 1:09:34.374
Think I figured it out.

1:09:35.977 --> 1:09:37.377
You know what? I think...

1:09:38.146 --> 1:09:40.748
I think
you want this to be true,

1:09:40.848 --> 1:09:42.750
Alex, because you know what?

1:09:43.550 --> 1:09:45.052
You wanna be the victim.

1:09:45.318 --> 1:09:47.554
It's what you've always
wanted to be, right?

1:09:47.855 --> 1:09:49.690
It's good. It's good.

1:09:50.124 --> 1:09:51.659
Victim?

1:09:51.759 --> 1:09:53.426
- Like you right now?
- Oh, Jesus.

1:09:53.527 --> 1:09:56.329
Or you every other night?

1:09:56.898 --> 1:09:58.666
"I lost my job."

1:09:59.033 --> 1:10:03.336
"It's so hard being unemployed
and having my wife support me."

1:10:04.005 --> 1:10:05.405
"I'm depressed."

1:10:05.873 --> 1:10:07.541
Boo-hoo.

1:10:08.575 --> 1:10:11.646
I have you
to remind me of that...

1:10:12.847 --> 1:10:14.347
every day.

1:10:17.551 --> 1:10:19.020
And you?

1:10:21.555 --> 1:10:23.758
Always posting selfies
on Facebook.

1:10:24.258 --> 1:10:25.059
Looking for attention,

1:10:25.259 --> 1:10:26.794
'cause you probably weren't
getting enough

1:10:26.894 --> 1:10:28.763
at home, were you?

1:10:28.863 --> 1:10:31.999
Man, it's a wonder Nate took
so long to figure you out.

1:10:33.167 --> 1:10:34.467
Yeah.

1:10:34.769 --> 1:10:36.070
Yeah, that's right, Alex.

1:10:36.170 --> 1:10:38.072
This is all one big conspiracy.

1:10:38.806 --> 1:10:39.674
Me, and...

1:10:40.174 --> 1:10:42.877
Becca, the neighbor,
the entire fucking world,

1:10:42.977 --> 1:10:45.478
all in cahoots
against little old you.

1:10:45.579 --> 1:10:47.380
- Fuck you.
- No. You know what? Fuck you!

1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:48.548
I trusted you!

1:10:48.649 --> 1:10:50.618
You did?

1:10:51.585 --> 1:10:52.987
No, you didn't.

1:10:53.087 --> 1:10:55.422
You have been looking
for a way to leave me

1:10:55.522 --> 1:10:57.892
without being the bad guy
for years.

1:10:58.558 --> 1:10:59.827
And guess what?

1:11:00.261 --> 1:11:02.029
Now you have it.

1:11:04.031 --> 1:11:06.067
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

1:11:07.467 --> 1:11:09.637
What, that I fucked
our neighbor,

1:11:09.737 --> 1:11:11.538
in our bed,
while you were at work?

1:11:13.007 --> 1:11:15.542
- Is that what you wanna hear?
- Keep going. Say it.

1:11:15.643 --> 1:11:16.711
It just might
make me believe you.

1:11:16.811 --> 1:11:18.545
I'm not gonna give you
what you want.

1:11:20.047 --> 1:11:22.750
Go ahead and kill me, Alex.
I don't fucking care.

1:11:24.085 --> 1:11:25.052
I don't...

1:11:25.853 --> 1:11:29.556
But I'm not gonna sit here
and give you the satisfaction

1:11:29.657 --> 1:11:32.093
of confessing to something
that I didn't do.

1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:34.494
It's not gonna happen.
Not today.

1:11:40.067 --> 1:11:42.402
You are right about
one thing, though. She is.

1:11:44.205 --> 1:11:46.107
You are
more dangerous than Nate.

1:11:47.675 --> 1:11:48.843
You know, he's just a...

1:11:48.943 --> 1:11:52.013
lonely, confused, no offense,

1:11:52.113 --> 1:11:54.481
pathetic drunk who doesn't
know what he's doing.

1:11:55.816 --> 1:11:56.984
But you?

1:11:58.819 --> 1:11:59.687
Fuck.

1:12:02.757 --> 1:12:04.659
You know exactly
what you're doing.

1:12:06.827 --> 1:12:08.696
And it scares
the shit out of me.

1:12:12.066 --> 1:12:14.201
I used to think that
she needed professional help.

1:12:15.169 --> 1:12:17.504
You know, with medication,
I thought that maybe you had

1:12:17.605 --> 1:12:19.173
bipolar disorder,
or some kind of,

1:12:19.273 --> 1:12:20.608
like, schizophrenia, but...

1:12:22.643 --> 1:12:24.011
You're not crazy.

1:12:24.645 --> 1:12:26.981
I mean, this is
who you are, Alex.

1:12:28.581 --> 1:12:30.785
I'm not about to degrade
a mental disorder

1:12:30.885 --> 1:12:34.088
to justify the fucking monster
you've become.

1:12:39.994 --> 1:12:41.228
What's so funny?

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:47.768
I have something
I want you to listen to.

1:12:47.868 --> 1:12:48.869
What is it?

1:12:48.970 --> 1:12:50.204
Ah, you'll see.

1:12:50.304 --> 1:12:52.173
I don't wanna spoil
the surprise.

1:12:53.274 --> 1:12:53.975
Oh my God.

1:12:54.342 --> 1:12:56.644
I just want you to listen
to something, okay?

1:12:58.679 --> 1:13:00.247
- What are you doing?
- I just want you to listen.

1:13:01.115 --> 1:13:03.851
I hear
the secrets that you keep

1:13:03.951 --> 1:13:06.253
when you're talking
in your sleep.

1:13:07.688 --> 1:13:10.758
My God, oh, are you serious?

1:13:12.793 --> 1:13:15.096
Are you gonna play me
one of those recordings again?

1:13:15.196 --> 1:13:17.530
Alex, we have been over this
a thousand times.

1:13:17.631 --> 1:13:18.265
Just listen.

1:13:23.904 --> 1:13:25.673
- Do you hear it?
- Hear what?

1:13:27.174 --> 1:13:29.276
- It's just mumbled voices.
- Shh.

1:13:29.377 --> 1:13:32.113
It's the same thing
we've heard a thousand times.

1:13:38.819 --> 1:13:39.787
There's nothing.

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:41.956
What is it?

1:13:42.056 --> 1:13:44.158
Started recording him
when he slept,

1:13:45.292 --> 1:13:47.228
because he didn't believe me.

1:13:47.328 --> 1:13:50.698
And I never found anything...
until now.

1:13:50.798 --> 1:13:52.199
You recorded him sleep talking.

1:13:52.299 --> 1:13:53.934
Yeah, it's a conversation.

1:13:54.035 --> 1:13:55.636
- With who?
- With you.

1:13:56.037 --> 1:13:58.039
Just before you start fucking.

1:13:58.139 --> 1:14:00.775
And it's the same
conversation every night.

1:14:02.710 --> 1:14:04.111
I don't hear anything.

1:14:07.815 --> 1:14:09.183
It's just a bunch of mumbles.

1:14:10.251 --> 1:14:10.951
It's me sleeping.

1:14:11.419 --> 1:14:13.721
I don't know why this is
entertaining to any of you,

1:14:13.821 --> 1:14:15.588
but there's nothing there.

1:14:15.923 --> 1:14:18.325
There never has been
anything on this, Alex.

1:14:18.426 --> 1:14:19.994
You realize that, don't you?

1:14:20.961 --> 1:14:22.029
Play it for me.

1:14:22.463 --> 1:14:24.999
- Becca, you don't need to con-
- No! I want to hear it.

1:14:40.047 --> 1:14:41.982
- This is insane.
- Shut up!

1:15:01.802 --> 1:15:03.370
<i>Where is she?</i>

1:15:05.673 --> 1:15:06.907
<i>Is she home?</i>

1:15:07.441 --> 1:15:08.876
<i>No.</i>

1:15:09.944 --> 1:15:11.212
<i>No, come in.</i>

1:15:12.046 --> 1:15:13.614
You hear it, don't you?

1:15:14.215 --> 1:15:15.883
<i>I...</i>

1:15:18.953 --> 1:15:22.123
<i>Stay. Stay here.</i>

1:15:23.290 --> 1:15:24.158
Thank you.

1:15:25.926 --> 1:15:27.061
Hear what?

1:15:29.130 --> 1:15:31.132
There's nothing
on the recording, Alex!

1:15:33.734 --> 1:15:35.136
You know it!

1:15:35.236 --> 1:15:36.370
So do you.

1:17:56.477 --> 1:17:57.778
Becca, give me your hand!

1:17:57.878 --> 1:17:59.413
Scoot over, Becca!

1:17:59.513 --> 1:18:00.981
We need to get out of this

1:18:01.081 --> 1:18:02.049
fucking now!

1:18:02.149 --> 1:18:03.851
This is our only fucking chance!

1:18:07.288 --> 1:18:08.522
Becca, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1:18:08.623 --> 1:18:10.257
- Who is it?
- What?

1:18:10.357 --> 1:18:13.060
Who is it that you talk about
in your sleep every night?

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:14.895
- Who is the woman?
- What? There is no one.

1:18:14.995 --> 1:18:16.063
Is it her?

1:18:16.163 --> 1:18:18.232
Carla? Hailey? Natalie?

1:18:18.565 --> 1:18:21.001
- It's Natalie, isn't it?
- What?

1:18:21.101 --> 1:18:21.935
So all this time

1:18:22.269 --> 1:18:24.004
when you've been talking
about how much you love me,

1:18:24.104 --> 1:18:25.439
how much you wanna be with me,

1:18:25.539 --> 1:18:27.374
you've been shagging
someone else. Is that it?

1:18:27.474 --> 1:18:28.909
- No...
- Because that scene

1:18:29.009 --> 1:18:30.244
that you talk
about in your sleep,

1:18:30.344 --> 1:18:31.545
it has nothing to do with me,

1:18:31.646 --> 1:18:33.080
- because we've never had sex...
- Becca...

1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:34.815
- ...in your bed!
- Sweetie, listen to me,

1:18:34.915 --> 1:18:36.116
there's no one else...

1:18:36.216 --> 1:18:37.518
You're such a fucking liar!

1:18:45.492 --> 1:18:46.393
Alex.

1:18:47.361 --> 1:18:48.395
Alex.

1:18:49.997 --> 1:18:50.964
Alex!

1:18:53.334 --> 1:18:55.169
Fuck.

1:18:55.969 --> 1:18:56.837
Dammit.

1:20:43.076 --> 1:20:44.077
Everything okay?

1:20:45.412 --> 1:20:46.280
Yeah.

1:20:52.085 --> 1:20:54.154
I made them up.

1:20:56.390 --> 1:20:57.591
They don't exist.

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:03.430
I... created a lie,

1:21:03.530 --> 1:21:06.300
because I was afraid
that Ian was gonna leave me.

1:21:07.735 --> 1:21:08.435
Oh, wow.

1:21:08.837 --> 1:21:11.171
And I wanted someone
to blame other than myself.

1:21:13.574 --> 1:21:14.709
That's a breakthrough.

1:21:21.816 --> 1:21:23.217
I wanna be better.

1:21:23.550 --> 1:21:25.018
You will.

1:21:26.587 --> 1:21:28.623
Trust me, you will.

1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:34.094
Let's go.

1:22:17.137 --> 1:22:17.772
Shit.

1:22:17.872 --> 1:22:19.339
She turned the ringer on.

1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:21.643
She turned
the fucking ringer on!

1:22:21.743 --> 1:22:22.644
Shit!

1:22:22.744 --> 1:22:23.611
Fuck.

1:22:23.711 --> 1:22:25.212
Fuck.

1:22:25.312 --> 1:22:27.214
He's gonna be here
any fucking second!

1:22:28.716 --> 1:22:29.717
No.

1:22:31.318 --> 1:22:32.386
Almost got it.

1:22:32.486 --> 1:22:33.320
Got it.

1:22:35.589 --> 1:22:37.157
Fuck!

1:22:37.257 --> 1:22:38.525
- Shh!
- Fuck.

1:22:39.092 --> 1:22:40.628
Right. Pull.

1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:47.769
- Yes. Free your hands.
- Yeah, okay.

1:22:47.869 --> 1:22:49.403
Shit!

1:22:50.805 --> 1:22:52.472
I need you to pull.
I need to pull it free.

1:22:52.573 --> 1:22:54.474
- Okay.
- One, two.

1:22:54.575 --> 1:22:56.276
Three.

1:22:58.111 --> 1:22:59.681
Okay.

1:23:01.950 --> 1:23:03.685
Do it, do it, do it!

1:23:07.588 --> 1:23:09.389
Ian, shh!

1:24:00.642 --> 1:24:02.242
- Baby. Baby.
- Nate.

1:24:02.342 --> 1:24:04.277
This is not
what it looks like, okay?

1:24:04.378 --> 1:24:06.546
Look at me. Put the gun down.
Put the gun...

1:24:11.919 --> 1:24:12.887
Shit!
