WEBVTT

00:09.342 --> 00:10.969
Ba-bum.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.179
[croaks]

00:14.556 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.016 --> 00:19.978
[Viren]  Previously on  The Dragon Prince...

00:28.403 --> 00:29.529
[gasps]

00:30.029 --> 00:33.033
[Viren]  General Amaya reports
that elven forces are gathering

00:33.116 --> 00:35.285
on the Xadian side of the Breach.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.413
We must be prepared to fight.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.042
[Callum]  I love this.
I love learning about magic.

00:43.084 --> 00:46.629
But I want you to teach me
to do some Moon Magic.

00:46.713 --> 00:52.260
[Lujanne]  In Xadia, all creatures are born
connected to a Primal Source.

00:52.343 --> 00:57.098
They have a piece of it inside them.
We call that piece an Arcanum.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.269
But learning magic is not your destiny.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.229
You can't do Primal Magic

01:03.313 --> 01:07.067
because you weren't born
connected to a Primal Source.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.945
I will learn magic. It's who I am.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.199
[theme music playing]

01:29.339 --> 01:30.882
[roaring]

01:54.114 --> 01:56.116
[Callum humming]

01:57.575 --> 01:59.410
[yawns]

02:01.204 --> 02:02.247
What are you doing?

02:02.914 --> 02:05.375
Meditating upon the meaning of sky.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.837
Ugh! That's more boring
than any answer I would have guessed.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.465
I'm trying to connect to the Arcanum
like Lujanne said,

02:12.549 --> 02:14.342
so I can use sky magic again.

02:14.926 --> 02:19.472
Didn't she also say you have to be born
with the Arcano-what's-it to do magic?

02:19.556 --> 02:22.475
No, she said you had to connect
to the Primal

02:22.559 --> 02:25.812
and that magical creatures
are born with a connection.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.481
But I don't see why
I can't make my own connection.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.733
By sitting weird and humming?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.485
Right. Seems reasonable?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.737
-[Callum hums]
-[Rayla sighs]

02:37.407 --> 02:40.869
Uh, is it just me,
or are we losing altitude?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.037
What? No way.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.124
I'm extremely attuned to slight changes
in the air flow...

02:46.207 --> 02:48.543
[all screaming]

02:55.925 --> 02:57.468
-[Zym whimpers]
-[Ezran yells]

03:01.890 --> 03:05.184
[sighs] It's nice having both hands again.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.854
[croaks]

03:20.783 --> 03:24.495
General Amaya, we've searched everywhere
and there's been no sign of the elves.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.955
I think it's safe to conclude

03:26.039 --> 03:28.458
that the outpost on the Xadian side
remains secret.

03:29.667 --> 03:33.254
There, look! The signal!
The outpost is secure.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.973
Yes, General. I'll ready a party.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.117
[sighs] Who are you?

04:13.753 --> 04:14.963
What is it?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.382
Where are you going?

04:19.550 --> 04:22.136
[Ezran] Phoe-Phoe is okay.
She's just tired.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.305
She gets her power from the Moon Nexus.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.725
The further away we go,
the harder it is to carry everyone.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.271
Wow, Ez, I can't believe
you could understand all of that.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.649
You did such a good job getting us so far.
Thank you.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.192
[Phoe-Phoe coos]

04:45.201 --> 04:47.787
-So, what do we do now?
-[Rayla] Well...

04:50.039 --> 04:51.791
Xadia's that way.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.962
Across miles and miles of the fluid
I both need to survive

04:56.045 --> 04:58.131
and hate more than anything in the world.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.884
You know what?
We'll just walk around it somehow.

05:01.968 --> 05:02.969
With our legs.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.053
No.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.724
That's sweet, but walking around
is gonna take too long.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.559
We need to get that former egg,

05:09.642 --> 05:13.187
now adorable baby dragon
home to Xadia as fast as we can.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.231
We've got to go straight across.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.488
Well, we need a boat.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.992
And a captain who knows how to make it go.

05:26.075 --> 05:26.951
Right.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.370
Specifically, a captain
who doesn't hate elves.

05:29.454 --> 05:34.500
[scoffs] That won't be a problem.
I can disguise myself as a human again.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.548
Hello, again, fellow humans,
human fellows.

05:40.631 --> 05:43.134
Oh, oh! You're going to love this, Zym.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.428
I'm a huge fan of human Rayla.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.431
Let's go judge and criticize things
other humans do,

05:48.514 --> 05:50.767
and then do the exact same thing
ourselves.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.935
[laughs] Do another.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.897
Sure thing, old buddy, old pal.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.025
I am excited to rapidly eat
a plate of unwholesome food

05:59.108 --> 06:00.985
in an excessive portion size.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.904
[laughs] She's right.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.989
-I'd eat a jelly tart the size of a dog.
-[Zym chitters]

06:05.073 --> 06:08.034
Won't it be great to encounter
other humans,

06:08.117 --> 06:10.369
and talk about which roads and pathways

06:10.453 --> 06:14.415
will take us somewhere slightly faster
than other roads and pathways?

06:14.499 --> 06:17.293
[laughs] It is so true.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.670
We do love going slightly faster.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.299
Hey, sometimes getting somewhere
slightly faster is important.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.552
Like, right now.
Ezran and I will find a sea captain.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.347
You stay here
and work on growing a fifth finger.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.725
You've got it, my smooth-skulled friend.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.720
You want me to find these items.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.931
I can do that.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.482
We found the perfect captain.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.901
-[Rayla exclaims]
-[Zym chitters]

07:25.903 --> 07:29.240
Uh, don't worry, that's not gonna be
a problem with this guy.

07:29.323 --> 07:33.453
What, is he some kind of enlightened human
who can really see the good in elves?

07:34.036 --> 07:36.873
Hmm. I'm not sure he can see
the good in anyone, really.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.542
But that's part of what makes him
uniquely qualified.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.420
We're back!

07:50.803 --> 07:51.888
Greetings!

07:52.889 --> 07:55.725
The name's Captain Villads.
The "D" is silent.

07:55.808 --> 07:56.642
There's a "D"?

07:56.726 --> 07:59.020
-Arr!
-Wait, there's a silent "R"?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.062
Narr.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.523
Oh, okay,
so it's just the silent "D" then.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.733
Aye!

08:03.816 --> 08:06.194
-Ah, so there's a--
-[Callum clears throat]

08:06.277 --> 08:09.822
This is our regular human friend, Rayla.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.199
Spelled like it sounds.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.578
And her cute, unusual dogs,
Zym and Bait.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.039
Ahoy, Rayla. Ahoy, doggos.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.541
And this is me first mate, Berto!

08:20.625 --> 08:21.959
I'm a parrot.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.753
Me ship's this way.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.299
Welcome to me water home,  The Ruthless!

08:29.467 --> 08:31.969
Named after me dear wife, Ruth.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.054
Who sadly...

08:33.137 --> 08:35.223
[sniffles] don't enjoy sailing.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.475
So, you said if the wind's on our side,

08:37.558 --> 08:39.143
we could make it across the bay
pretty quickly?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.394
Aye!

08:40.478 --> 08:42.939
'Course, there's a storm coming.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.900
A storm?
That could be interesting.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.778
So, we have to delay departing
for a few days.

08:48.861 --> 08:53.366
Uh, we're on a tight schedule.
Isn't there anything we can do?

08:53.449 --> 08:56.035
Hmm, I suppose if we leave right now,

08:56.118 --> 08:58.371
we could race across the bay
and beat the storm.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.705
Yes. Let's do that.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.624
No problem.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.294
Unless the storm catches us mid-bay,
and kills us all. [chuckles]

09:11.342 --> 09:13.803
-[dolphins trill]
-[Ezran] Whoo!

09:15.805 --> 09:18.140
Ye might be wondering
what happened to me eyes.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.643
Well, I didn't want to be rude.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.938
Me left eye was taken
by a flock of mutinous seagulls.

09:24.021 --> 09:27.149
Uh, wow. And what about your right eye?

09:27.233 --> 09:29.694
Don't know. Came at me from me left.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.572
-[seagull squawks]
-[wind gusts]

09:37.076 --> 09:38.077
Hey, wait.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.831
How are we going that way when the wind
is blowing us in that direction?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.417
Oh, that's how you sail, me boy.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.628
[Callum] The wind doesn't push us
where we want to go?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.424
The sail is more like a wing,
flying through the wind,

09:51.507 --> 09:54.343
pulling the boat
against the water currents below us.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.472
It's like shooting a willow melon seed
from between your fingers.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.893
You squeeze in on both sides,
but the seed shoots straight out.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.439
I think I get it.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.274
[Villads exclaims]

10:10.443 --> 10:12.778
After you're in the elements long enough,

10:12.862 --> 10:16.699
you get a feel for where the wind is
and how it's about to change.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.786
It's like a connection, deep in me bones.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.414
Hold on, you feel a connection
to the wind?

10:23.497 --> 10:24.665
How did you get that?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.918
What, just because I'm blind
and have narcolepsy

10:28.002 --> 10:29.503
you thought I wouldn't have sailing sense?

10:29.587 --> 10:30.421
No! No, no, no.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.381
That's not what I meant, I...
Wait, narcolepsy?

10:32.465 --> 10:33.841
[Villads snoring]

10:34.467 --> 10:37.970
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up--

10:38.054 --> 10:40.723
[exclaims] What happened?
The last thing I remember,

10:40.806 --> 10:42.808
I was talking about narcolepsy
and then falling asleep.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.810
Yeah. That's about right.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.563
[Zym whimpers]

10:49.982 --> 10:51.025
[thunder crashes]

10:51.525 --> 10:52.360
[whimpers]

10:53.235 --> 10:54.612
Storm's a comin'.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.990
Seems as if we won't beat it after all.
[laughs]

10:58.741 --> 11:01.994
-Huh. Maybe it's my chance.
-A chance to die.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.830
I was gonna to say my chance to learn.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.083
To learn how to drown. [squawks]

11:40.574 --> 11:43.202
I've never seen this rune before.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.113
You expect me to drink this?

12:24.326 --> 12:25.494
[liquid sloshes]

12:30.458 --> 12:32.835
Ah. It's surprisingly not terrible.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.562
Why should I trust you?
I don't even know who...

12:51.645 --> 12:53.606
I don't even know what you are.

12:56.984 --> 12:57.818
[sighs]

12:58.402 --> 12:59.820
I need time to think.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.993
[thunder rumbling]

13:08.412 --> 13:09.288
[gags]

13:09.955 --> 13:10.956
[Zym whimpers]

13:12.333 --> 13:14.043
You're turning different colors.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.711
Is that your Moonshadow form?

13:15.794 --> 13:19.256
No. This is
my rare glow toad impersonation.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.926
[gags and grunts softly]

13:23.052 --> 13:24.303
[Bait croaks]

13:25.221 --> 13:26.680
[Villads] Storm's too strong!

13:26.764 --> 13:29.475
Best we moor
on the lee side of the island,

13:29.558 --> 13:32.102
-and wait till it calms.
-[Berto squawks]

13:33.020 --> 13:34.772
Berto, to the bow!

13:36.023 --> 13:37.441
Aye, aye!

13:38.067 --> 13:39.610
Port, port!

13:49.870 --> 13:51.914
Current fast! Drop the sail!

13:58.671 --> 14:00.172
Starboard! Starboard!

14:03.050 --> 14:04.093
[Callum exclaims]

14:10.558 --> 14:11.934
Port! Port!

14:13.519 --> 14:14.728
[Rayla exclaims]

14:25.322 --> 14:26.991
Nailed it. Squawk!

14:28.284 --> 14:30.119
Did he just say the word "squawk"?

15:06.697 --> 15:10.868
I don't understand.
Why would the outpost be abandoned?

15:10.951 --> 15:12.119
They just sent the signal a few--

15:15.581 --> 15:18.208
Soldier, your signal was late.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.127
What happened?
Where is everyone?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.588
Yes. My apologies, sir.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.965
The others went on patrol,
and I missed my cue.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.509
The next signal will happen
exactly on the hour.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.427
[Fen scoffs]

15:38.687 --> 15:39.521
[soldiers gasp]

16:07.549 --> 16:09.635
[thunder rumbling]

16:10.844 --> 16:13.305
[Villads] Well, we didn't beat the storm.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.391
-We'll have to wait it out below deck.
-[Zym whimpers]

16:15.474 --> 16:19.103
Hooray. We're wet and miserable
and we've saved no time at all.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.400
Hey, are you coming or what?

16:25.150 --> 16:26.652
Yeah. I agree.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.404
[Rayla scoffs]

16:29.279 --> 16:33.283
I know that face.
It's the "dumb idea" face.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.206
Every time the lightning strikes,
I can feel something.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.458
Yeah, me, too.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.420
It feels good
to not be struck by lightning.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.754
No, I mean,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.966
it feels like it did
when I used the Fulminis spell.

16:49.049 --> 16:53.595
Maybe, if I'm brave enough to go into it,
and face the storm,

16:53.679 --> 16:55.097
that's how I'll make the connection.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.141
Or it'll blow you up until you're dead.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.436
[Zym panting and chittering]

17:02.479 --> 17:06.150
See? Zym gets it. He can feel it, too.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.446
-You really wanna go out there, don't you?
-[Zym whimpers]

17:10.529 --> 17:12.197
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.576
It's one thing to stupidly risk
your own stupid human life,

17:15.659 --> 17:17.536
but I am not gonna let you risk

17:17.619 --> 17:19.538
the life of the future
King of the Dragons.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.751
He is a storm dragon.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.503
He'll be safe.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.762
If you die out there,
I swear I'll kill you.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.184
[Callum humming]

17:40.267 --> 17:43.062
Okay. It's wet.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.190
Mmm... The wind is blowing.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.399
[wind howling]

17:47.483 --> 17:49.026
It's blowing a lot.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.237
I'm cold, I'm soaked.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.531
Is your skin
supposed to wrinkle up like this

17:54.615 --> 17:57.451
-when you understand the Sky Arcanum?
-[Zym chitters]

18:00.245 --> 18:02.289
I don't think I feel any different.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.337
Maybe I need to get higher up.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.548
[grunting]

18:19.139 --> 18:21.475
[yells and grunts]

18:22.059 --> 18:22.893
[gasps]

18:35.072 --> 18:36.073
[Zym chitters]

18:36.156 --> 18:38.659
[Callum] I don't know
how I'm supposed to get this, Zym.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.870
You're a magical creature.
Somehow, it's inside you.

18:41.954 --> 18:46.333
But I'm just a human.
There's nothing inside me.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.252
I want this so much.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.505
When I could do magic,
I finally felt like myself,

18:51.588 --> 18:56.802
and now I've lost that.
I'm just trying to find my way back.

19:03.559 --> 19:07.479
It looks like the Primal Stone.
That's where we need to go.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.988
[bird cawing]

19:25.247 --> 19:26.623
Did a message come for me?

19:26.707 --> 19:29.293
Ah, yes. Four messages, in fact.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.337
Four messages came for me
and I was not informed?

19:32.421 --> 19:36.383
Actually, we searched the entire castle.
We couldn't find you anywhere. [chuckles]

19:36.466 --> 19:39.928
What, are you hiding in some
secret chamber somewhere? [chuckles]

19:40.721 --> 19:42.598
I was in the bathroom.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.350
Oh, right.

19:50.689 --> 19:55.027
[gasps] The other four kingdoms
have agreed to a summit of the Pentarchy.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.945
Wow, that sounds important.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.365
I will rally the kings and queens
behind Katolis

20:00.449 --> 20:03.410
and finally destroy the Xadian threat!

20:04.328 --> 20:06.622
You are witnessing history.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.124
[sighs] That is great.

20:09.708 --> 20:13.045
Um, would you rate the service
you received today as excellent?

20:15.172 --> 20:17.007
[thunder crashing]

20:21.637 --> 20:23.889
It's a lightning rod.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.615
-Maybe if I...
-[Zym whimpers]

20:45.035 --> 20:46.870
No, I can't. [sighs]

20:48.163 --> 20:51.750
I have to do this.
I have to understand the Sky Primal.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.924
-[Zym whimpering]
-Come on, come on!

21:02.219 --> 21:03.053
[grunts]

21:06.807 --> 21:08.767
Ah, Callum, you're being an idiot.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.896
Why would you do that?
You can't risk your life to learn magic.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.899
This is crazy. [panting]

21:29.329 --> 21:30.747
[all grunting]

22:30.682 --> 22:33.018
[yelling]

23:22.150 --> 23:23.652
Callum, what happened?

23:24.903 --> 23:28.073
We went into the heart of the storm,
and Zym...

23:28.615 --> 23:31.201
-he got struck by lightning.
-[Ezran and Rayla gasp]

23:33.954 --> 23:36.748
-But I think he's okay.
-[Zym hiccups]

23:36.832 --> 23:39.209
-[Ezran laughs]
-[Zym chitters happily]

23:40.669 --> 23:41.586
What's wrong?

23:42.337 --> 23:46.007
-I feel stupid. You were right.
-Callum...

23:47.592 --> 23:51.429
I could have gotten Zym killed.
I put us both in danger.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.764
And worst of all,

23:52.848 --> 23:55.267
when we were right there,
in the center of the storm,

23:55.350 --> 24:00.605
I thought I wanted this badly enough,
but in the end I didn't have the guts.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.942
Good.
