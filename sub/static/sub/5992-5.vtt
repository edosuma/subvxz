<i>(NARRA TOR)
My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:04.882 --> 00:06.682
<i>I was born</i> a <i>Saxon</i>

00:06.842 --> 00:09.762
<i>but stolen and raised as</i> a <i>Dane.</i>

00:10.562 --> 00:13.522
<i>Now I find myself bound
to King Alfred</i>

00:13.682 --> 00:15.962
<i>and bound by marriage to Wessex.</i>

00:16.562 --> 00:18.082
<i>I have</i> a <i>Christian wife</i>

00:18.682 --> 00:20.042
<i>whom I care for</i>

00:20.722 --> 00:22.962
<i>and</i> a <i>child I have never seen.</i>

00:23.522 --> 00:25.882
<i>lhave land, burdened with debz'--</i>

00:26.042 --> 00:28.122
It is a substantial amount, lord.

00:28.282 --> 00:31.162
Alfred could remove the debt,
but he has chosen not to.

00:31.602 --> 00:34.762
<i>--And a sly servant I cannot trust.</i>

00:35.322 --> 00:37.682
<i>And though I miss the ways
of the Danes</i>

00:37.842 --> 00:40.042
<i>and their hunger for life
and for batt/e--</i>

00:40.642 --> 00:45.642
Never cross Ubba
and never, never fight him.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.402
<i>--Fate has stirred
my Saxon heart for</i> a <i>reason.</i>

00:49.562 --> 00:51.682
(MAN) Ubba and his army returned
from Ireland.

00:51.842 --> 00:53.762
And my fleet is where?

00:53.922 --> 00:57.202
(MAN) They left Lundene several days
ago and are nearly here, lord.

00:59.322 --> 01:00.842
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

01:46.442 --> 01:48.162
(THUNDER CRACKING)

01:58.882 --> 02:00.882
(HORSES NEIGHING)

02:02.402 --> 02:04.162
(MAN) Lord?

02:04.322 --> 02:08.521
Lord, when will you
need assistance?

02:13.362 --> 02:14.762
(BABY CRYING)

02:14.922 --> 02:16.602
Mildrith.

02:17.602 --> 02:20.322
- Odda?
- Mildrith, thank God.

02:20.722 --> 02:23.042
- What are you doing here?
- Come with me.

02:23.202 --> 02:24.962
Peace is over,
we are under siege.

02:25.122 --> 02:27.402
- Since when?
- Gather all you need quickly.

02:27.562 --> 02:30.002
- Danes could be here any time.
- I cannot go.

02:30.162 --> 02:32.802
- Yes, you can.
- If peace is over, what of Uhtred?

02:32.962 --> 02:35.562
Mildrith,
the Danes have broken the truce.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.802
We've killed all the hostages.
They'll have done the same.

02:38.962 --> 02:42.162
If Uhtred has survived,
it can only be as a traitor, a Dane.

02:42.322 --> 02:44.802
- No.
- Regardless,

02:44.962 --> 02:48.682
it is no longer safe for you here.
You must come with me.

02:49.562 --> 02:52.322
Mildrith, I beg you,
for the sake of your child.

02:54.282 --> 02:56.362
(MAN) Do not worry about us, lady,

02:56.522 --> 02:59.722
we'll get ourselves
and the livestock to the hills.

02:59.882 --> 03:03.082
Get yourself clear of this place.

03:03.802 --> 03:08.522
Anything of value, I will bury!

03:23.082 --> 03:24.882
(GULLS SQUAWKING)

03:44.082 --> 03:46.082
(MAN)
Don'tjust pull. You'll have it torn.

03:46.642 --> 03:50.042
- Find out what holds it.
- (UHTRED) How much for your horse?

03:55.962 --> 03:57.962
He's not for sale.

03:58.722 --> 04:01.322
(UHTRED) I'll give you twice its worth.

04:02.282 --> 04:04.122
In silver.

04:10.282 --> 04:12.202
Have any washed up alive?

04:12.562 --> 04:14.242
Not on my beach.

04:14.402 --> 04:16.322
God's taken hundreds
of the bastards.

04:17.402 --> 04:20.601
Though hundreds more have landed
safely further up the shore.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.082
Friends of yours?

04:26.402 --> 04:29.442
(UHTRED) You should take
your families to safety.

04:35.882 --> 04:38.442
(ALFRED) Ertwit?
(WOMAN 1) He has your look.

04:38.602 --> 04:43.162
- Definitely.
- Little Ertwit. Little Ertwit.

04:43.322 --> 04:44.682
(CHUCKLES)

04:44.842 --> 04:47.682
Well, let's hope he does not develop
my constitution. Hm?

04:47.842 --> 04:49.722
(WOMAN 2) My turn, my turn.

04:49.882 --> 04:51.602
They are here.

04:52.482 --> 04:54.362
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

04:56.482 --> 04:58.042
Odda. Wulfhere.

04:58.202 --> 04:59.762
- Lord.
- Lord.

04:59.922 --> 05:03.122
(ALFRED) Difficult times,
which we will face head-on.

05:03.282 --> 05:05.802
- They never rest.
- Do we march as one, lord,

05:05.962 --> 05:07.882
- or are we to split?
- We are split.

05:08.282 --> 05:11.122
You both ride towards
the Severn River to face Ubba,

05:11.282 --> 05:12.642
I ride south to Guthrum.

05:12.802 --> 05:15.522
Should we not all be marching
to the Severn, lord?

05:15.682 --> 05:19.242
If the first battle is won, then the Danes
may not care for a second.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.762
Even in victory we can't be sure
of our surviving numbers.

05:23.362 --> 05:26.282
Some of Guthrum's ships
will have made it to shore

05:26.442 --> 05:29.042
and I cannot let him
simply walk through Wessex.

05:29.202 --> 05:30.562
He must be faced.

05:31.362 --> 05:34.762
Odda, should either of us have luck
and defeat our enemy quickly,

05:34.922 --> 05:38.362
- we will march to the other's aid.
- Yes, lord, of course.

05:38.522 --> 05:40.042
Prepare.

06:35.122 --> 06:37.402
(MAN GRUNTING)

06:38.882 --> 06:42.482
By God, girl,
you're a lovely field to plough.

06:42.642 --> 06:44.602
A lovely field to plough.

06:44.762 --> 06:46.842
Oh! Better than barley.

06:47.002 --> 06:49.322
Better than barley. Oh!

06:49.482 --> 06:52.962
By God, girl, better than barley.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.922
Better than barley.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.922
- Yeah!
- (SHRIEKING)

06:57.282 --> 06:58.802
Better than barley!

06:58.962 --> 07:00.442
(BOTH SCREAMING)

07:00.602 --> 07:02.602
Lord! Lord!

07:02.762 --> 07:06.402
Forgive rne. Never happened before,
I swear it'll never happen again.

07:06.882 --> 07:08.642
- It was the girl's idea.
- Was not.

07:08.802 --> 07:10.882
- (UHTRED) Where's my wife?
- It was not my--

07:11.042 --> 07:14.002
- Where's my wife and child?
- Wait. Wait, lord.

07:14.162 --> 07:16.482
- She's with Lord Odda, the Younger.
- Odda?

07:16.642 --> 07:20.162
Yes. He took the lady and your son.
Willingly to protect the child.

07:20.322 --> 07:23.402
- My son?
- Yes, lord. You have a son.

07:23.722 --> 07:25.522
Handsome little man he is.

07:25.682 --> 07:27.922
Looks like his father.

07:28.442 --> 07:30.562
I should take your balls
for this desecration.

07:30.722 --> 07:34.322
- Yes, lor-- No, lor-- Please.
- I don't care for you, your wife,

07:34.482 --> 07:37.242
- your children, your whore.
- (WOMAN) He made me do it.

07:37.402 --> 07:38.722
With the promise of coin.

07:38.882 --> 07:41.842
It was false promise, lord,
I have no coin.

07:42.642 --> 07:46.242
- I'll need a horse, food and drink.
- (MAN) Yes. Your horse was returned.

07:46.602 --> 07:48.802
It's in the stable.

07:48.962 --> 07:52.402
- My house is not your house.
- No, lord. I beg your pardon, lord.

07:52.562 --> 07:55.082
My land is not your land.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.482
Treat rne as a fool again
and I'll kill you.

07:57.642 --> 07:58.962
Yes, lord.

07:59.122 --> 08:00.842
I'll enjoy it.

08:01.162 --> 08:02.642
I believe you would.

08:17.722 --> 08:19.242
Leave me.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.802
Uhtred...

08:32.802 --> 08:34.922
...son of Uhtred.

09:09.442 --> 09:11.322
We outnumber them, I feel.

09:12.642 --> 09:15.642
(LEOFRIC) We outnumber them
if you count the farm boys and women.

09:16.282 --> 09:18.442
You fear them, Leofric?

09:18.602 --> 09:22.762
- I do not. Though some do.
- It's not about fear, it's about strategy.

09:22.922 --> 09:25.562
We hold the high ground,
they must come to us.

09:25.722 --> 09:28.122
- If they decide to wait?
- Why would they?

09:28.282 --> 09:30.962
Because we are sat isolated
on this high ground.

09:31.122 --> 09:34.002
- (WULFHERE) And supplies are low.
- They don't know that.

09:36.202 --> 09:39.082
We bide our time. Hold our position.

09:39.682 --> 09:44.362
With luck, Alfred will see off Guthrum
and provide us with reinforcements.

09:45.642 --> 09:47.882
For now we stay put

09:48.042 --> 09:49.842
On this hill.

10:12.322 --> 10:13.882
Lord.

10:14.042 --> 10:16.362
They are gathering
and they're watching.

10:16.842 --> 10:18.642
They have the higher ground.

10:18.802 --> 10:21.002
But I do not want to wait.

10:21.162 --> 10:26.002
So when do I attack?

10:27.882 --> 10:29.922
- I'll cast the runes.
- Storri.

10:31.362 --> 10:33.082
I'll need a clear answer.

10:34.562 --> 10:36.682
I will get one.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.882
(MURMURING)

11:00.282 --> 11:01.602
I have your answer, lord.

11:03.442 --> 11:07.282
Look, this is us
at the base of their hill,

11:07.442 --> 11:08.922
they sit on top,

11:09.322 --> 11:12.482
but that's not an advantage.

11:14.082 --> 11:17.322
This is a feather from that camp,

11:17.482 --> 11:19.162
bone-dry and faded.

11:21.122 --> 11:24.562
Water runs down the hill, not up.

11:25.922 --> 11:28.882
You have your wish, lord.
An early attack is good.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.082
They're weak.

11:32.242 --> 11:34.562
They will surrender or die...

11:36.642 --> 11:39.162
...and then we move
into the heart of Wessex.

11:40.842 --> 11:42.882
Shield wall!

11:47.562 --> 11:51.242
Advance! One! Two!

11:51.402 --> 11:53.882
- (MAN 1) Horseman approaching!
- Halt.

11:55.762 --> 11:58.882
(MAN 2)
Pick it up! You there, pick it up!

12:08.322 --> 12:09.642
Go and fetch Lord Odda.

12:10.682 --> 12:12.362
The Elder.

12:19.362 --> 12:21.242
It is Uhtred.

12:21.402 --> 12:24.082
- How could he have lived?
- We will ask.

12:25.362 --> 12:27.362
Ealdorman,
we feared you'd been killed.

12:27.522 --> 12:31.322
(YOUNGER) That you were not is
a miracle or something less godly.

12:31.482 --> 12:32.962
- (UHTRED) Where is she?
- What?

12:33.122 --> 12:35.282
- Where's my wife and child?
- She's safe.

12:35.442 --> 12:37.882
- You brought her?
- Safe! Did you not hear him?

12:38.042 --> 12:40.762
- I took her to safety.
- (ELDER) Mildrith is with my wife!

12:40.922 --> 12:42.762
On my land, in my house,

12:42.922 --> 12:45.882
where she had lived happily
in the past. Put away your dagger.

12:46.042 --> 12:48.122
(UHTRED) Swear you haven't laid
a hand on her.

12:48.282 --> 12:49.922
- I will do no such thing.
- Swear!

12:51.682 --> 12:53.122
(LEOFRIC) Lord.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.842
You will take your blade away
from my lord and you will do it now.

12:58.802 --> 13:00.602
Arseling.

13:01.842 --> 13:06.202
You have my word that neither Mildrith
nor your son have been harmed.

13:06.682 --> 13:09.282
I swear. Do as I ask.

13:09.442 --> 13:11.762
(UHTRED PANTING)

13:16.082 --> 13:17.762
Treason, but what can we expect?

13:17.922 --> 13:21.482
Enough,
this in-fighting and argument!

13:21.642 --> 13:22.962
Disperse, all of you!

13:23.122 --> 13:24.762
NQW!

13:27.602 --> 13:30.522
Your wife remains my goddaughter.

13:30.682 --> 13:32.922
You should be thanking my son,
not threatening.

13:33.082 --> 13:35.042
Now, come to me
when your thinking is clear

13:35.202 --> 13:38.802
and you explain to me why
you are still breathing and stupid!

13:43.122 --> 13:46.282
You are back from the dead
and unchanged.

13:46.882 --> 13:49.162
All you had to do
was get down and ask:

13:49.322 --> 13:51.402
"Have you seen my wife?"

13:56.402 --> 13:59.202
That would have been
the better choice, yes...

14:01.162 --> 14:03.642
...but then young Odda
wouldn't have shit himself.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.802
(BOTHLAUGH)

14:09.002 --> 14:10.762
You've seen her? She's well?

14:10.922 --> 14:12.682
She is well.

14:12.842 --> 14:14.442
- The child, however...
- Sickly?

14:14.602 --> 14:16.682
- Ugly.
- Like his father?

14:16.842 --> 14:20.082
Worse, with the smallest of pebbles
for a penis.

14:20.242 --> 14:21.682
Like his father.

14:21.842 --> 14:23.642
(UHTRED CHUCKLES)

14:23.802 --> 14:27.642
If you wish to see him for yourself,
I say you leave the way you came.

14:28.282 --> 14:30.922
I'm serious. We are stuck on this hill,

14:31.642 --> 14:33.002
and here we will die.

14:33.562 --> 14:37.402
- What does Odda say?
- Odda is a decent man,

14:37.562 --> 14:41.002
but as a warrior, he has all the guile
and menace of a sheep.

14:44.642 --> 14:46.962
(ELDER)
We have the ground, the slope.

14:47.722 --> 14:50.442
- I will not surrender that.
- (LEOFRIC) If food is scarce,

14:50.602 --> 14:53.082
- how long can we wait?
- We shall find food.

14:53.242 --> 14:57.042
- For how many days, two, three--?
- Enough time for Alfred to arrive.

14:57.642 --> 15:00.602
You reported that the storm
had taken most of Guthrum's ships.

15:00.762 --> 15:03.242
- But not all.
- But enough, perhaps.

15:03.642 --> 15:05.322
So we wait. Hm?

15:05.682 --> 15:08.362
Agreed. For a time.

15:09.722 --> 15:12.322
We give Alfred
as much time as possible.

15:16.322 --> 15:20.082
I will offer negotiations. While
these negotiations are taking place,

15:20.242 --> 15:23.202
we will send out hunting parties,
several.

15:25.922 --> 15:28.442
Alfred will come.

15:29.682 --> 15:31.722
I'll attend these negotiations
with Ubba.

15:31.882 --> 15:33.282
You have not been invited.

15:38.962 --> 15:40.362
It's my right.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.882
If the other hostages were killed,
how did he survive?

15:56.042 --> 15:59.082
He was taken as a child
by the Danes and he survived.

15:59.242 --> 16:00.882
We would do well to follow him.

16:01.042 --> 16:02.722
Follow him?

16:03.562 --> 16:07.722
Or listen to what he has to say, lord,
is what I meant.

16:25.682 --> 16:27.482
Lord Ubba.

16:27.642 --> 16:30.482
May I present
the Lord Odda of Wessex.

16:30.882 --> 16:33.842
There never seems to be a meeting
that you do not attend.

16:35.322 --> 16:36.922
Is there more than one of you?

16:37.082 --> 16:40.762
Lord Ubba,
Odda's Alfred's most trusted general.

16:43.362 --> 16:45.442
I don't give a shit who he is.

16:45.602 --> 16:48.882
All he needs to do is to surrender.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.682
There will be no surrender.

16:51.682 --> 16:53.002
What will there be?

16:54.042 --> 16:57.162
There will be no surrender.

16:58.482 --> 17:01.082
Though I do invite you
to return to your ships.

17:01.242 --> 17:04.962
Guthrum may have broken the peace,
but no need for Ubba to do likewise.

17:05.561 --> 17:08.362
We will not be returning to our ships.

17:08.521 --> 17:11.162
And I shall not be moving
from this hill.

17:11.321 --> 17:15.281
- You have no business in Wessex.
- My business is to kill you.

17:17.801 --> 17:20.041
- You may try.
- Guthrum's fleet's gone.

17:21.842 --> 17:23.682
Njord reached out from the deep

17:23.842 --> 17:26.642
and dragged Guthrum's fleet
down to the seabed.

17:26.801 --> 17:28.321
You're lying.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.802
I watched the fleet die
and its men go under.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.802
Storri, what do you say?

17:33.322 --> 17:38.162
- I do not see for Guthrum. I see for you.
- Storri wears a stick up his arse.

17:38.322 --> 17:40.882
- He didn't see that coming either.
- (STORRI) No--

17:41.042 --> 17:43.802
That's a lie.
It's all lies. Look at his eyes.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.162
You're next to die, Ubba.
I cast the runes.

17:46.322 --> 17:49.362
- Even bigger lie.
- Ragnar the Fearless is with the gods.

17:49.522 --> 17:52.602
They're angry at you.
You allow his death to go unpunished.

17:52.762 --> 17:55.962
Avenging Earl Ragnar
is not my business.

17:56.122 --> 17:58.682
- That's for his son.
- You're next to die, Ubba.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.282
(YELLS)

18:00.442 --> 18:03.242
Then fight me!
And you'll see who's next to die.

18:03.402 --> 18:05.002
- Fight me.
- Lord,

18:06.242 --> 18:09.162
- we're negotiating.
- You will not say another word.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.602
- He will not say another word.
- He will not. No.

18:12.762 --> 18:14.442
Best not.

18:14.922 --> 18:17.842
I will not say another word.

18:18.442 --> 18:20.122
Talking is over.

18:21.082 --> 18:24.762
You piece of weasel shit.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.682
Storri.

18:30.842 --> 18:32.402
Storri!

18:42.242 --> 18:43.682
(EXHALES)

18:44.602 --> 18:46.442
What now, eh?

18:47.042 --> 18:49.602
- Where are we left? In shit?
- Now we have time.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.522
How? You've made them want
to kill us even more.

18:52.682 --> 18:54.602
We should attack.

19:32.602 --> 19:34.402
(MEN LAUGH)

19:47.842 --> 19:50.042
(ELDER) My men are good men.

19:52.842 --> 19:57.522
Though half of them are armed only
with reaping hooks, they're here.

20:01.802 --> 20:03.722
Reaping hooks can kill.

20:06.762 --> 20:09.442
How well do you know Ubba?

20:10.402 --> 20:13.522
I've known Ubba
since I was 11 years old.

20:15.082 --> 20:17.842
He's the greatest warrior
I've ever seen.

20:18.322 --> 20:21.442
But he's cautious.
He listens to the gods, always.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.042
I goaded him
only to make him doubt.

20:26.122 --> 20:28.522
It will take a little while
for the doubt to clear.

20:28.682 --> 20:30.322
You have your time.

20:30.482 --> 20:32.282
But I say again, we should attack.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.402
If we attack, we'll be outflanked.

20:34.562 --> 20:37.642
My men will die. All of them.

20:38.242 --> 20:39.842
I know each of them.

20:42.282 --> 20:46.602
I'd hoped this hill
and Alfred might save them.

20:46.762 --> 20:48.082
Us.

20:48.602 --> 20:50.202
Alfred won't come.

20:50.362 --> 20:52.642
The food won't last,
and Ubba's mind will clear.

20:53.282 --> 20:57.002
It seems inevitable.
They'll take Wessex.

20:57.162 --> 21:00.562
What if we were able
to outflank the Danes?

21:01.562 --> 21:04.682
- How?
- We burn their ships.

21:06.402 --> 21:09.322
Even just three or four,
they'd be running to the fire.

21:09.482 --> 21:13.562
- Then we attack.
- They'll be disorganised, no shield wall.

21:13.722 --> 21:16.642
We could be killing them
before they know we're there.

21:16.802 --> 21:18.402
Who would set the fires?

21:18.922 --> 21:20.522
I Will.

21:20.962 --> 21:22.562
Alone.

21:23.842 --> 21:28.282
But I'll need your word that you'll attack
as soon as the fires have taken hold.

21:31.442 --> 21:33.122
You have it.

21:34.642 --> 21:37.242
If we succeed, lord,
you'll have saved Wessex.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.922
(YOUNGER)
If he succeeds and fires the ships,

22:14.442 --> 22:17.042
it will undoubtedly cause panic
amongst the Danes.

22:17.202 --> 22:19.082
Which is the aim.

22:19.482 --> 22:22.642
How best do we use that panic?

22:27.322 --> 22:30.282
Is an attack likely to be successful?

22:32.242 --> 22:36.602
Would it not be better
to escape this hill?

22:37.402 --> 22:41.402
We could return to Winchester
without the loss of a single man.

22:42.002 --> 22:44.202
Excepting Uhtred.

22:46.402 --> 22:50.322
Father, if what Uhtred says
about the storm is true,

22:51.322 --> 22:54.522
and Guthrum's fleet
is all but destroyed,

22:54.842 --> 22:57.642
we would join forces with Alfred.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.242
We may well meet him on the road,

23:02.762 --> 23:05.362
then we are all against Ubba.

23:07.122 --> 23:09.762
As a strategy, it makes sense.

23:22.842 --> 23:24.962
I gave him my word.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.242
He Will die

23:28.322 --> 23:30.002
and you can call him a hero.

23:32.322 --> 23:34.282
The others are here.

23:36.162 --> 23:38.602
You must decide
what you will tell them.

23:50.722 --> 23:54.082
I've called for you
to tell you to ready your men.

23:54.242 --> 23:56.962
All men. Everyone.

23:57.122 --> 24:00.282
- We shall be moving, soon.
- Moving, lord?

24:00.442 --> 24:03.642
Ealdorman Uhtred's volunteered
himself to distract the Danes.

24:03.802 --> 24:06.282
- He'll set alight their ships.
- He has gone?

24:06.442 --> 24:07.882
- Yes.
- Alone?

24:08.042 --> 24:13.882
Yes. If he should succeed in causing
this distraction, we will move.

24:14.562 --> 24:18.162
- In which direction, lord?
- Ready your men. Tell them nothing.

24:18.322 --> 24:20.642
Lord Odda, with respect,
you told us nothing.

24:20.802 --> 24:22.682
- Ready your men.
- For battle?

24:22.842 --> 24:24.442
Ready your men.

24:24.602 --> 24:28.722
- Each of you. Go.
- Prepare.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.122
Lord Odda, we are ready,

28:19.282 --> 28:20.602
but to do what?

28:25.842 --> 28:27.642
He's done it.

28:28.362 --> 28:30.562
Look, he's fired the ships.

28:35.602 --> 28:37.162
We attack.

28:37.322 --> 28:40.362
(STORRI) Lord? Lord, you awake?

28:41.362 --> 28:42.722
- Lord.
- What?

28:42.882 --> 28:45.242
- The ships have been fired.
- Ah!

28:50.002 --> 28:52.362
- It's him. I know it.
- Yes.

28:52.522 --> 28:56.162
You saw them dying on the hill.
Did you not see a fire?

28:56.322 --> 28:58.402
I can only see what the runes allow.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.842
- How many ships burn?
- I don't know. Many.

29:01.002 --> 29:03.722
They are planning something,
they must be.

29:14.602 --> 29:16.162
Lord.

29:16.802 --> 29:19.562
There. That's him.

29:31.722 --> 29:34.282
I will make the square!

29:36.802 --> 29:39.842

29:40.362 --> 29:43.802
Are you the son
of Ragnar the Fearless

29:45.442 --> 29:49.642
or are you a coward?

30:05.802 --> 30:08.682
I'll fight you, Ubba,
if that's what you want,

30:09.002 --> 30:10.322
but you will die.

30:11.922 --> 30:13.402
Fetch him a shield.

30:21.522 --> 30:23.762
You're half naked, lord,
you might catch a chill.

30:24.562 --> 30:26.922
This will not take long.

30:36.722 --> 30:38.682
Was it you? The fires?

30:41.842 --> 30:44.002
Must have been the gods.

will ever come to a king.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.202
A great battle at Cynuit, lord.

40:48.482 --> 40:50.802
Lord, I have a gift for you.

40:53.802 --> 40:55.642
Ubba is dead.

40:55.802 --> 40:57.562
His army is defeated.

41:00.482 --> 41:03.282
- This is-- This is true?
- It is, lord.

41:03.442 --> 41:05.842
- Two days ago.
- (BEOCCA) Praise God. Praise him.

41:06.442 --> 41:07.762
(EXHALES)

41:07.922 --> 41:09.362
Well, then Wessex is saved.

41:10.402 --> 41:13.282
It is, yeah, for a time.

41:13.442 --> 41:17.082
Guthrum will have no choice now
but to make peace.

41:18.602 --> 41:22.842
As your father recovers, take his place.
His lands will be your lands and more.

41:25.362 --> 41:26.882
Wessex is saved.

41:44.722 --> 41:46.762
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

41:47.282 --> 41:49.922
Everybody is walking to the palace.

41:50.922 --> 41:52.402
A celebration.

41:52.562 --> 41:55.602
It must be. A celebration of prayers.

41:57.442 --> 41:58.842
(WOMAN) Stop that.

41:59.322 --> 42:01.602
I believe you did this.

42:04.962 --> 42:08.202
(BEOCCA) The great hall is now full.
There is no more room.

42:08.362 --> 42:12.362
The king thanks you all for coming,
but you need to pray here, outside.

42:12.522 --> 42:14.802
- (UHTRED) Father Beocca.
- The palace is full.

42:14.962 --> 42:17.842
- Father Beocca.
- There'll be ale and food available.

42:19.482 --> 42:21.042
Uhtred?

42:24.522 --> 42:26.082
You are here before me now.

42:26.242 --> 42:28.322
I am, and with my child.

42:29.002 --> 42:31.082
Oh, God be praised. You are alive.

42:31.242 --> 42:35.482
- Of course. Why shouldn't I be alive'?
- You were at Wareham, a hostage,

42:35.642 --> 42:38.042
- we thought you were dead.
- I was at Cynuit.

42:38.202 --> 42:40.402
I fought at Cynuit.

42:43.322 --> 42:44.722
Did they not say?

42:47.282 --> 42:49.442
- I'll see Alfred now.
- (MILDRITH) What is it?

42:49.602 --> 42:52.562
(BEOCCA) Nothing I'm sure that cannot
be resolved given time.

42:52.722 --> 42:54.242
Uhtred.

42:54.402 --> 42:58.762
- (UHTRED) I'll see Alfred.
- Uhtred, Alfred is at peace.

42:59.762 --> 43:01.202
Uhtred, please!

43:04.042 --> 43:06.082
Uhtred, please.

43:06.242 --> 43:07.842
You cannot disturb prayers.

43:10.642 --> 43:12.362
Uhtred.

43:12.682 --> 43:15.082
Uhtred, your sword!

43:16.282 --> 43:18.482
(ALL MURMURING)

43:31.922 --> 43:35.162
- I'm told that you believe me dead?
- This is not the time.

43:35.322 --> 43:37.162
Father Beocca here
believed me dead,

43:37.482 --> 43:41.522
and yet just days ago
I was at Cynuit with Lord Odda.

43:41.682 --> 43:44.442
It was Lord Odda and I
who devised our battle plan.

43:44.602 --> 43:47.002
- Did the boy not say?
- (BEOCCA) Uhtred, stop, now.

43:47.522 --> 43:50.682
- Perhaps you'd like to speak now?
- You will say nothing.

43:50.842 --> 43:52.562
Perhaps describe Ubba's death?

43:52.722 --> 43:55.202
Lord, I'd like to invite
the ealdorman here to join us

43:55.362 --> 43:57.162
in giving thanks and prayer.

43:57.322 --> 43:58.762
Giving thanks?

43:58.922 --> 44:01.722
For what, for victory?
For the death of the pagan?

44:01.882 --> 44:05.282
- Who do you think killed the pagan?
- I cannot save you.

44:05.442 --> 44:08.442
I fought Ubba man on man
and I killed him.

44:08.602 --> 44:11.802
It was his axe against my sword.
This sword!

44:12.442 --> 44:14.442
Is there any man here
who will deny it?

44:14.962 --> 44:16.522
(ALFRED) Be still.

44:16.682 --> 44:19.322
Everyone, be still and be silent.

44:23.602 --> 44:25.482
I have heard enough.

44:25.642 --> 44:27.642
You have said enough.
This is not seemly.

44:27.802 --> 44:31.762
Now, sheath your sword
and remember where you stand.

44:31.922 --> 44:33.802
Lord, what I'm saying to you--

44:35.562 --> 44:39.282
You have broken my peace.
You have broken the peace of Christ,

44:39.442 --> 44:41.362
brought weapons
into a sacred place.

44:41.522 --> 44:44.122
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Go to the courtyard

44:44.282 --> 44:46.322
and wait for me to pass judgement.

44:46.482 --> 44:48.562
Judgement? For what?

44:48.722 --> 44:51.682
- I've done nothing wrong--
- You will be quiet!

45:13.922 --> 45:15.522
We will, um...

45:17.002 --> 45:19.962
We will continue
with a moment of silence

45:20.802 --> 45:24.202
to help find the peace once more.

45:38.922 --> 45:43.082
This interruption cannot be allowed
to go unpunished.

45:43.242 --> 45:45.362
It must be death.

45:46.682 --> 45:48.482
Peace be with you, my dear.

46:18.602 --> 46:21.602
Why are you unable to reason?
To show patience?

46:21.762 --> 46:23.122
All I expect is justice.

46:23.282 --> 46:27.202
- It comes to those who have faith.
- Now is not the time to talk of faith.

46:27.362 --> 46:29.122
Now is precisely the time.

46:29.282 --> 46:32.522
- Now is when it's needed.
- I'll have none of it.

46:35.362 --> 46:37.882
You're too ready with anger.

46:39.962 --> 46:43.602
There's a bad spirit within you
that needs to be exorcized.

46:43.962 --> 46:45.282
You should look to God.

46:46.842 --> 46:48.762
I'll pray for you.

46:49.162 --> 46:50.562
Humility is what you need.

46:50.722 --> 46:52.522
What I need, woman, is justice.

47:14.802 --> 47:16.402
(SNORING)

47:17.642 --> 47:19.162
(GROANS)

47:20.162 --> 47:22.722
- You sober?
- Delicate.

47:22.882 --> 47:25.762
You are to grovel.

47:26.202 --> 47:27.802
(GROANS)

47:28.682 --> 47:31.362
- What, again?
- With me.

47:35.482 --> 47:39.002
All I did was abscond
from a monastery.

47:47.682 --> 47:50.362
- (UHTRED) Ealdorman Wulfhere.
- You know this wretch?

47:50.522 --> 47:51.842
We've met.

47:52.002 --> 47:55.362
The king has sent me to punish you,
along with Aethelwold here.

47:55.522 --> 47:59.602
What his wife would like is for me to pull
your guts through your smelly arse.

47:59.762 --> 48:02.362
Aelswith is forever inventive.

48:02.802 --> 48:06.762
Lady, you are to go to Aelswith
for comfort. She waits in the chapel.

48:12.722 --> 48:15.802
Know the punishment for drawing
your sword before the king'?

48:16.322 --> 48:17.962
A fine.

48:18.122 --> 48:21.002
- Payable to the church, no doubt?
- Death.

48:22.962 --> 48:24.682
But Alfred is feeling merciful.

48:24.842 --> 48:27.962
You will not dangle, not today.

48:28.522 --> 48:31.162
He wants your assurance
you will keep the peace.

48:31.762 --> 48:34.322
- What peace?
- His peace, you fool.

48:36.802 --> 48:40.002
It does not matter a gnat's dick
that you killed Ubba.

48:40.322 --> 48:44.962
What matters is that Odda the Younger
has claimed the credit.

48:45.362 --> 48:47.282
Should his father die
from his wounds,

48:47.442 --> 48:51.282
Odda becomes one of the richest men.
Men will want to praise his bravery.

48:51.442 --> 48:54.322
- My bravery.
- Not a gnat's dick.

48:54.482 --> 48:57.282
The sun now shines
from Odda the Younger's arsehole,

48:57.442 --> 49:01.762
and it is blinding.
Do you understand me?

49:03.642 --> 49:04.962
Good.

49:05.882 --> 49:07.242
You are to do penance.

49:08.042 --> 49:09.402
To do what?

49:09.562 --> 49:11.282
(AETHELWOLD) Grovel.

49:11.442 --> 49:16.242
You are to dress like a girl,
go on your knees and be humiliated.

49:16.402 --> 49:18.882
- I won't grovel.
- Then Aelswith gets her wish

49:19.042 --> 49:22.442
and I pull your guts through your arse.
Which will it be?

49:24.082 --> 49:27.042
On your knees.

49:28.682 --> 49:30.882

all the way to the palace

and lie flat down on your face.

And then what?

49:44.202 --> 49:47.282

54:03.442 --> 54:05.162
You knew that.

54:08.322 --> 54:11.202
I hear you're young Odda's man now.

54:14.282 --> 54:19.322
I'm passed from father to son, yes.
Like the land.

54:19.482 --> 54:21.002
I can't stay in Wessex.

54:21.722 --> 54:24.722
You have a wife,
a child you could not wait to see.

54:25.082 --> 54:26.922
Where would you go?

54:30.722 --> 54:32.802
Odda is afraid that you will kill him.

54:33.122 --> 54:34.882
Tell him I might.

54:35.042 --> 54:37.962
Tell him each night,
before he goes to bed.

54:38.122 --> 54:41.082
- (LAUGHS)
- I need to find wealth,

54:41.602 --> 54:43.162
but here it's impossible.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.442
The Danes,
they would see it and take it.

54:46.442 --> 54:47.882
Then that is what we do.

54:49.522 --> 54:52.122
We become Danes and we plunder.

Men will follow you.
Those men we have schooled,

others who were at Cynuit,
they will follow you.

55:03.202 --> 55:05.522
You're saying that we raid?

55:06.762 --> 55:09.402
We find wealth and we take it.

55:09.562 --> 55:11.682
- Here in Wessex?
- No.

55:11.842 --> 55:14.442
You do not shit at your own table.

55:14.602 --> 55:17.482

We take it from the Britons.

55:19.522 --> 55:21.042
Do not say yes.

55:21.202 --> 55:23.882
Not yet. Think.

55:24.442 --> 55:26.362
I'll do the same.

and not us?

- A miserable day.

Where was it felled, this tree?

56:29.882 --> 56:31.202
On the top ridge, lord.

56:31.362 --> 56:32.762
On my land?

56:32.922 --> 56:36.082
Yes, lord. I'm taking it
to Wigulf's Mill for splitting.

56:36.242 --> 56:38.642
- He buys it'?
- He splits it, lord.

56:39.002 --> 56:42.522
We need, uh...
We need timber for repairs.

56:42.682 --> 56:44.722
He takes his payment in split wood.

56:44.882 --> 56:47.122
We need timber,
why not split it ourselves?

56:47.442 --> 56:51.162
- Wigulf has always done it, lord.
- So if I go to Wigulf,

56:51.322 --> 56:54.602
he'll tell me how many such trees
he has split,

56:54.762 --> 56:56.362
and you'll show me the timber?
