01:13.160 --> 01:16.767
So, the Aldridge Mansion is the only
19th century home in New York City

01:16.880 --> 01:19.281
preserved both inside and out.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.930
At the time of its construction,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.321
it was one of the most
elegant homes in existence.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.560
Interesting fact.
This grandfather clock was on the Titanic

01:27.640 --> 01:29.722
and was saved by Sir Aldridge.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.209
A Romanian woman and her child were
forced to leave the lifeboat to make room.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.243
Over here,

01:36.320 --> 01:40.609
you can imagine Sir Aldridge
entertaining his wealthy guests.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.811
It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnum
first had the idea to enslave elephants.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.210
And if you'll follow me...

01:52.640 --> 01:57.043
Now, I'm gonna tell you
something a little spooky.

01:57.560 --> 02:02.805
On the morning of October 25th, 1894,
Sir Aldridge awoke, furious,

02:02.880 --> 02:04.848
when his breakfast was not waiting for him.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.765
So he called to his servants,
but none of them responded.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.645
Why?

02:11.880 --> 02:15.851
Because, during the night, one by one,

02:15.920 --> 02:19.367
they had each been stabbed to death
in their sleep.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.330
It was later discovered

02:22.400 --> 02:26.121
they were murdered by his eldest daughter,

02:27.280 --> 02:29.203
Gertrude Aldridge.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.248
Sir Aldridge once wrote in his diary,

02:31.320 --> 02:33.209
"I know God makes no mistakes,

02:33.600 --> 02:36.888
"but I believe he may have been drunk
when he built Gertrude's personality."

02:36.960 --> 02:39.725
Now, to spare the family public humiliation,

02:39.800 --> 02:41.962
instead of turning her in to the police,

02:42.280 --> 02:45.682
they locked her in this basement.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.645
And they fed her

02:49.280 --> 02:50.725
through this slot.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.486
Years later, when a new owner moved in,

02:54.640 --> 02:56.722
they dug out her remains.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.925
But, after repeatedly hearing strange sounds,

03:01.360 --> 03:03.044
he sealed it shut.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.324
That's right.
No one has opened this door since then.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.531
Okay.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.726
Follow me.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.683
Maybe steer clear of the door.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.401
Sorry, Sir Aldridge.
I got to get out of here!

04:46.680 --> 04:48.170
Garret, you idiot.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.926
No.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.084
No.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.881
No! No! No!

05:11.760 --> 05:13.205
No! No!

05:13.520 --> 05:15.284
No!

05:29.680 --> 05:31.250
Daniel. Teresa.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.842
Dr. Roberts. Robert, hello.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.288
- Erin, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hello, Phil.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.084
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.801
- Did you hear the news?
- Tell me.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.201
I'm lecturing in the big hall today.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.362
- Darling, that's wonderful.
- I know.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.523
- This is what you're wearing?
- What?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.841
I have someone I want you to meet.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.208
Phyllis, I would like
to introduce Erin Gilbert.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.602
She specializes in
theoretical particle physics.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.523
I'm a huge fan.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.204
This is such an honor to meet you.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.966
Phyllis is guest lecturing
in Daniels' astrophysics and cosmology.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.124
Erin just learned she's being published.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.648
Yes, well, I'm very proud.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.485
I don't allow my lab
to submit to journals anymore.

06:18.560 --> 06:23.122
I think journals tamper with the process
and ultimately hurt scientific research.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.888
Yeah. It's like when scientists get caught up,
you know, in those dumb awards.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.566
- You know...
- Awards are massively important.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.450
Yes, no, I was saying
it'd be dumb not to go after awards,

06:33.520 --> 06:35.602
'cause that's where science really shines.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.810
It's, unfortunately, the only way
to draw attention to good science.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.331
Excellent point.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.643
All right. I should be going.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.721
Hey, Simon.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.005
Well, I'm going to lecture right now

06:50.800 --> 06:52.040
in the big hall.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.170
It's good that it's big, too, 'cause I've got
a lot of big ideas I'm going to be spreading.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.562
Hey, good luck on your tenure review.
Make me proud.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.241
Fingers crossed.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.926
Not that crossing your fingers
means anything, 'cause it doesn't.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.889
I couldn't disagree more.

07:05.960 --> 07:10.363
It's been proven that superstitions
can have tremendous performance benefits.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.206
Exactly. I'm wrong about everything.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.128
All right. Well, I'm gonna try to get out
of here without stepping on these cracks.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.885
I don't want my mom calling me, like...

07:20.440 --> 07:23.011
See, when they change direction,
you've got to...

07:23.240 --> 07:24.969
So, you know her?

07:25.040 --> 07:27.008
Ding dong.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.081
Yeah.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.528
Sean, that is an excellent question.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.967
As you can see from my calculations,

07:34.040 --> 07:39.365
we will soon be able to combine
general relativity and quantum theory.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.242
Teaching in the big hall. Big day.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.730
Big hall. Big hall. Big hall!

07:50.880 --> 07:52.006
Big hall!

07:52.240 --> 07:55.210
Sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak
to you about something you wrote.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.407
I'm sorry. Yes. What...

07:59.800 --> 08:00.847
What publication?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.240
I'm talking about your book.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.041
Book.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.403
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.482
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my class will be here any minute.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.005
You're Erin Gilbert, right?

08:12.120 --> 08:13.485
Co-author of Ghosts from Our Past:

08:13.560 --> 08:16.166
Both Literally and Figuratively:
The Study of the Paranormal?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.650
I think you're looking
for a different Erin Gilbert.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.326
One that likes very long titles.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.450
Okay. But this really does look like you.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.731
What? No.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.160
Yeah, that's me.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.809
Look, it was a very long time ago,

08:32.880 --> 08:35.087
and it was just a gag
between a couple of friends.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.486
I'm sorry.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.528
A 460-page gag?

08:39.280 --> 08:41.931
The first sentence is, "This is not a joke."

08:42.240 --> 08:43.366
What do you want?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.680
Well, I'm Ed Mulgrave.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.969
I'm the historian at the Aldridge Mansion,
and I believe it's haunted.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.690
If you could just come take a look.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.570
I tried the police, but I just sound crazy.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.883
I'm sorry.
That book you're holding is utter nonsense.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.841
I don't even know how you got that.
I thought I burned both copies.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.922
It's on Amazon. Both hard copy and e-book.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.527
- What?
- It's on Books on Tape, too.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.045
Only, I know how to read.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.647
Is it now?

09:08.440 --> 09:09.487
No!

09:09.560 --> 09:12.484
No, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna kill you, Abby.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.041
Erin.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.327
Hi! Dr. Filmore. Hello, hi.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.643
We're set for the final review
of your tenure case on Thursday.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.207
Great.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.886
But I saw that you had
a recommendation letter

09:24.000 --> 09:25.764
from Dr. Branum at Princeton.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.088
Their science department
is really not what it used to be.

09:30.160 --> 09:34.370
And I would consider getting a referral
from a more prestigious college.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.249
More prestigious than Princeton?

09:36.720 --> 09:37.721
Yes.

09:39.920 --> 09:44.084
You see, I think you're an asset
to modern physics,

09:44.160 --> 09:47.164
but I would hate to see you
throw it down the drain.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.722
No. No, no, no, sir.
I won't throw it down the drain.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.450
And I will get on that letter.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.481
Yes. Princeton.
More like Prince-tons of dummies go there.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.605
About your clothes...

09:58.840 --> 10:00.444
Yes? Did you...

10:02.240 --> 10:05.130
Too sexy for academia?

10:05.480 --> 10:06.641
Never mind.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.840
No, no, no. What is it?

10:09.320 --> 10:11.004
- Never mind!
- I don't...

10:15.400 --> 10:18.051
Abby. You promised you wouldn't do this.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.640
"Abigail continues her passion
for the study of the paranormal

10:22.720 --> 10:26.247
"at the Kenneth P. Higgins
Institute of Science."

10:36.320 --> 10:37.765
Come on, F7!

10:38.360 --> 10:39.407
Are you kidding me?

10:51.720 --> 10:52.721
Hello?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.643
I've been waiting a long time.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.089
Has been a while, hasn't it?

10:57.600 --> 11:00.206
Hope you brought me more than one wonton.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.286
Excuse me?

11:09.360 --> 11:12.489
Well, well, well.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.121
Erin.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.726
Abby.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.607
Bennie.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.445
Yes, I know who you are, Bennie.
Can I just...

11:20.760 --> 11:23.923
Can I have my lunch
that I've been waiting an hour for?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.968
You know they make
smaller headphones now, right?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.605
It's an advance in science.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.410
Thank you for asking.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.369
Probably the future you're looking at.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.561
Here you go.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.211
Why don't you show Miss Gilbert to the door.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.089
It's just the same door we came in from.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.049
- Yeah, I know how to get out. It's figurative.
- It's really not that hard.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.450
- No, I'm okay.
- Don't.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.405
- I tried.
- Poorly.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.645
You put our book online
without my permission.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.411
I don't need your permission.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.761
Of course you need my permission.
I wrote that book with you.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.046
My name is on it.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.248
No. Absolutely not.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.761
That book is a whole new
revenue stream for me.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.764
And I'm, like, one-tenth away from
getting a new mini fridge in here.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.285
Look, I am up for tenure right now.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.691
"I'm up for tenure."

12:04.200 --> 12:06.726
And if my colleagues at Columbia University
google my name,

12:06.800 --> 12:08.609
that is the first thing that comes up.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.001
Along with a ghost emoji now,
thank you very much,

12:11.080 --> 12:12.161
- that does a little dance.
- You know what?

12:12.240 --> 12:14.049
That book was our baby.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.647
And you abandoned that baby
before it even learned to fly!

12:17.720 --> 12:20.610
Okay, well, books can't fly.
And neither can babies, so...

12:20.680 --> 12:22.330
You don't know. I'll tell you what.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.291
If I had a human baby that could fly,
I wouldn't be telling the press about it.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.762
If I had a flying baby,
I'd zip this, and so would you.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.525
There is no experimental backing
for anything in that book.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.682
And it makes me look like a crazy person.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.206
- God! Are you kidding me?
- What?

12:37.360 --> 12:39.328
I got one wonton!

12:39.400 --> 12:43.325
I got a tub of soup,
and I got one split wonton.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.164
Look at that, just floating there.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.369
I'm sorry you're having
a soup crisis right now.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.920
There's not even any meat in there.
That's just a carrot.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.286
Abby, please.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.090
- Yes.
- Abby!

12:53.160 --> 12:54.161
I got one wonton!

12:54.400 --> 12:55.561
What do I have to do?

12:55.640 --> 12:59.087
I will take my top off for Bennie
if it gets me three more wontons.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.731
I swear to God.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.640
You carry a lot of tension in your shoulders.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.687
I'm sorry, hello? Who are you?

13:08.760 --> 13:10.649
Holtzmann. Virgo.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.848
Avid skier. Gluten-full.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.811
And 100% jazzed to meet you.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.642
Don't get too close to her, Holtzmann.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.007
She'll ask you to write a book,
and then she'll squash your dreams.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.127
Okay.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.486
Holtzmann works with me here in the lab.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.042
She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.003
She would not abandon you.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.451
I get it.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.330
She also happens to specialize in
experimental particle physics.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.442
- She was almost hired by CERN.
- That's very impressive.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.170
What happened?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.766
- There was a lab incident.
- But he's gonna wake up.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.769
- He woke up yesterday.
- Great.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.842
Then he screamed
and went back into a coma.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.843
Well, I bet all that screaming
tuckered him out.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.446
Can we get back to our discussion please?

13:50.520 --> 13:54.161
Gosh, it sounds like a great time,
but I'm gonna have to say no

13:54.240 --> 13:56.322
because Holtzmann and I are really busy here

13:56.400 --> 13:59.768
actualizing what we just
theorized about in our book.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.887
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.487
We're incredibly close on the hollow laser
for the reverse tractor beam.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.800
Really close.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.370
You're making a reverse tractor beam?

14:07.440 --> 14:10.364
Abby, why don't you let her listen
to the EVP.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.488
- What EVP?
- No. Not... There's no EVP.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.086
- EVP is electro...
- Electro voice phenomenon.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.764
I'm familiar. I know what it means.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.366
And there's never been one substantiated.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.329
There hasn't? There hasn't been one...

14:21.400 --> 14:22.845
You know what? You come with me.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.048
With a suit on and you get so cocky.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.961
A few months ago, we spent eight nights
at the Chelsea Hotel.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.201
We didn't get anything.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.210
Well, we didn't think so.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.126
And then later, in the lab, when we were
reviewing these tapes...

14:48.480 --> 14:49.891
- You really got me.
- You know what?

14:49.960 --> 14:51.405
Usually we can't even get people over here.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.369
- But we have never...
- She came right over to it.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.250
Never had anybody actually
put their face down close to the machine.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.244
It's a cool joke. That was funny.
It's disgusting.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.721
Is it more or less disgusting
if I tell you it came from the front?

15:01.800 --> 15:04.451
- You didn't...
- I can do it live if you want.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.049
What's next? You gonna give me a wedgie?

15:07.120 --> 15:11.444
No. I think both of us pretty much feel
you have enough stuck up your butt.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.887
Burn!

15:14.520 --> 15:16.761
Okay, you know what, I thought
we could have an adult conversation,

15:16.840 --> 15:18.604
but apparently we can't.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.001
Erin, if you don't believe
in this stuff anymore,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.082
then why were you looking for the book?

15:23.160 --> 15:27.165
A man came to see me at my work
saying his building was haunted.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.767
What building?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.444
The Aldridge Mansion.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.602
It's obviously a joke.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.365
What are you doing?

15:37.480 --> 15:38.561
See, this is, this is exactly...

15:38.640 --> 15:40.529
- You want to go find some ghosts?
- Yes.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.047
Break!

15:46.040 --> 15:48.168
- Wait, you're going?
- I got the pack.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.804
Abby! Please, Abby. The book.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.723
Come on. Let's go!

15:52.800 --> 15:54.131
I'm not going with you guys.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.804
No. Are you kidding?

15:55.880 --> 15:57.245
You were never invited!

15:57.320 --> 15:59.687
I need you out of the lab,
so I can lock the door.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.091
Well, you said "let's," so...

16:02.160 --> 16:03.571
- Oh, my God. Just pull the...
- We're wasting time.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.130
Just close the door behind you, it'll lock!

16:05.200 --> 16:06.486
Abby, wait!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.525
Hey! Taxi!

16:09.160 --> 16:10.491
- Hey! Hey!
- Abby.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.005
Abby, come on.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.082
Please, Abby, just
take the book down. Please.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.885
All right, all right,

16:15.960 --> 16:19.203
but you have to introduce us
to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.486
Yes, he would love to meet you.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.801
Then I will consider, maybe,

16:22.880 --> 16:25.929
taking the book down
until you get your stupid tenure

16:26.000 --> 16:27.365
at your stupider college.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.727
Absolutely. Yes, I will. Yes, of course!

16:34.160 --> 16:35.321
You got it?

16:37.240 --> 16:39.163
Excuse me! Excuse me!

16:39.480 --> 16:40.686
We're not open.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.524
- Can I help you?
- Yes. Hi.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.931
We're looking for Ed Mulgrave.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.685
- I wanted to introduce these people to him.
- Hi there.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.524
He came to see me this morning.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.489
- Ed Mulgrave?
- Yes.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.131
But Ed Mulgrave died 15 years ago.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.004
- Yes! That's awesome!
- What?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.684
Dead for 15 years!

16:56.760 --> 16:58.922
Ed's a ghost! Knew it!

16:59.280 --> 17:00.566
I just saw him today...

17:01.520 --> 17:02.601
He's...

17:03.000 --> 17:04.161
So, who is this?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.367
That's Ed's son. Ed Junior.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.169
Okay. That's obviously who I meant. That's...

17:08.240 --> 17:12.768
Hi, Junior. If I may, when is the last time
the paranormal entity was actually seen?

17:12.839 --> 17:16.810
And if you were to rank it, let's say between
probably a T1 and T5...

17:16.880 --> 17:20.042
Garret here saw it on Tuesday,
and I believe it made him soil himself.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.167
- Jesus.
- Wow. Soiling.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.003
I'd put that at a T3.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.606
T4, if it was poop.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.125
- What?
- Unless you ate something weird.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.406
Then it wasn't the ghost.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.608
Kinda hard to suss that out
after the fact though.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.920
I didn't soil myself.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.844
He did. He called me sobbing, saying,
"Oh, my God, my pants are toast."

17:34.920 --> 17:37.366
Did you happen to keep
a sample of the soiling?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.441
A sample?

17:38.520 --> 17:40.443
- Okay. All right.
- I'd love to get that back to the lab.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.251
Well, so I have made the introduction.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.765
- Yeah, thank you.
- There you go.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.683
All right, well, how 'bout
you take us across the street.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.331
I got to get in there, set up.
Let's go on a tour.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.011
You're gonna die in there.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.251
Aldridge Mansion. Take one.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.129
And we are rolling.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.168
Checking the settings. We look good.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.207
What is that?

18:00.280 --> 18:03.045
Looks like one of those things
that makes cotton candy.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.009
It's a PKE meter.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.888
There's a ghost anywhere around here,
this baby's gonna find it.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.326
Does it work?

18:10.440 --> 18:12.681
Yeah, it works.

18:12.760 --> 18:16.446
I just haven't had the appropriate proximity
to an entity for it to work.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.010
Strange reading here.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.131
Ma'am, can you tell us where you got
the world's tiniest bow tie?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.364
It came with the shirt.

18:25.760 --> 18:29.082
Okay, somebody really doesn't
want us getting in that door.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.521
Can you tell us what it's like
to walk around in those shoes all day?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.768
- It's not fun.
- All right.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.120
Holtzmann, check this out.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.361
Hold your ponies.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.965
All right. Good gag.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.565
Hey, are you getting that?

19:02.640 --> 19:03.687
Very funny.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.684
Is everything a joke to you guys?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.001
Just your mama.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.242
No, actually, I think the world of your mom.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.322
You guys put all that
gooey stuff on the floor.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.281
You opened the basement door.
You tried to freak me out.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.970
We did not open the basement door...

19:18.200 --> 19:19.247
Basement door is open.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.841
- I didn't open it. Did you open it?
- I did not open it.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.044
You know what, it was probably Ed.
And the guy who didn't poop his pants.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.806
Look over there.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.844
I didn't even know it did that.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.843
- I... My ears just...
- Mine just popped, too.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.921
That is definitely...

19:42.000 --> 19:43.684
- An AP-xH shift. Yes!
- Shift.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.240
- I mean, for sure. That's...
- Guys?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.564
I don't think we're alone.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.880
Holy crap.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.445
Let me have the camera. Thank you.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.601
Okay.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.844
How can you be eating right now?

19:58.920 --> 20:00.331
Once you pop...

20:09.840 --> 20:11.569
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

20:11.880 --> 20:13.484
Good God.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.244
Class 4 apparition.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.845
Distinct human form.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.809
This can't be happening.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.484
It's happening, all right.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.449
That's the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.651
I'm gonna try to talk to it.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.561
Just be careful, she could be malevolent.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.529
Yeah, just make sure you're recording it.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.125
- Yeah, I'm getting it all.
- Okay.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.531
Just be cautious.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.047
I think she wants to communicate with us.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.406
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.009
It's okay. She seems peaceful.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.691
Hello.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.605
I think you're gorgeous.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.566
Hello. Hi.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.763
My name is Erin Gilbert,
Doctor of Particle Physics at Columbia...

21:05.680 --> 21:07.444
- Yes!
- God!

21:07.520 --> 21:08.760
She's getting away! Come on!

21:10.360 --> 21:12.089
- Hurry, hurry!
- Run!

21:12.160 --> 21:13.650
- Get it, get it!
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

21:14.280 --> 21:16.044
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
- There!

21:20.600 --> 21:22.045
What just happened?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.690
Abby, what just happened?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.686
I'll tell you what just happened.
We saw a ghost.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.966
- We saw a ghost!
- Yeah, we saw a ghost!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.690
We saw a ghost! Oh, my God!

21:30.760 --> 21:32.285
- We saw a ghost.
- We saw a ghost!

21:32.840 --> 21:34.649
Oh, my God, we saw a ghost!

21:36.480 --> 21:38.209
We were right! We weren't crazy!

21:43.280 --> 21:44.645
We saw a ghost!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.529
Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!

21:46.600 --> 21:49.171
I believe in ghosts 'cause I just saw one!
They're real!

21:51.680 --> 21:53.330
Who is that?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.323
Dr. Bronstein saw this on Reddit.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.643
It was re-blogged
from a site entitled Ghost News.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.242
Not a publication I'd heard of.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.085
I hope you understand that
when we give someone tenure...

22:06.400 --> 22:07.890
I accept your tenure.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.806
When we give someone tenure,
they represent this institution.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.522
But this is just not
what this institution is about.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.561
Dr. Gibbons.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.848
Found mold in my office, so I gotta move.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.685
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want people to panic or anything.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.966
Kids, hello.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.442
I didn't get fired. Even though
I have the old plant in the box.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.285
Margaret, hi.
Just taking my plant out for some air.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.883
Just like to carry it in this box
with all my other personal stuff.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.322
Phil. Phil. Hi. Phil...

22:41.400 --> 22:44.051
If you turn around, you'll see me.
I'm right behind you.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.963
Yeah. He's looking at that chart.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.926
Couldn't figure that out, either.
Call me when you figure that out.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.570
Haven't been able to.

22:50.680 --> 22:51.886
Samantha. Hi. How are you?

22:51.960 --> 22:55.362
Sixty. Seventy.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.522
Sometimes, I like to
put all my stuff from my office in a box

22:57.600 --> 23:00.809
and just do some exercises
and just use it as weights. Eighty.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.807
Well, I hope you're happy.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.131
That video you posted got me fired.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.801
Fired!

23:11.160 --> 23:15.165
- No! God, no! We will all die.
- Turn to ash from the inside out.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.522
- What?
- Put it down. Carefully.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.728
- Put it... Put it down... Oh, my God.
- Fired!

23:22.800 --> 23:24.962
After years,

23:25.720 --> 23:26.801
years of hard work.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.120
And ass-kissing.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.248
God, I kissed so many
different kinds of asses.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.483
Erin, we're sorry that you lost your job.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.325
But, I mean, there is
kind of a glass is half full aspect of it.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.528
I mean, we saw a real ghost.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.090
You know, and she was beautiful.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.170
Till she dislocated her jaw
and ecto-projected all over you.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.846
Yeah, that stuff went everywhere,
by the way, in every crack.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.323
But, I got to say, even that was
kind of spectacularly beautiful.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.522
I did detect a heavy ionization discharge.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.601
I mean, I could smell it.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.571
A full-torso transmogrification
with corporeal aggression.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.529
I mean, how often does that happen?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.443
I mean, they want us to be quiet about that?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.409
We are not gonna be quiet about that.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.689
And it's not just us.
We have over 100 comments already.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.131
And they're not all crazies.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.611
Come here, I want to show you this.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.045
Read that.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.726
"Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."

24:17.800 --> 24:19.370
No, no. Okay.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.090
The one below it.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.767
This woman is describing
a Class 3 haunting in her house.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.207
She can't just move.
She can't call the police.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.089
She can't call her friends.
Who's she gonna call?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.162
Ghost Jumpers!

24:31.280 --> 24:33.681
Tonight, the Ghost Jumpers
make contact with the ghost of Bigfoot.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.728
God! These phonies!

24:35.800 --> 24:37.040
I mean, you know what?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.722
These guys are the reason you got fired.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.885
It's because of stuff like this that makes it
impossible for us to do our real work.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.731
This cannot be the best option for people.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.963
Okay, we are on the cusp of something here,
a real discovery.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.771
Unlike Columbia,
this institute is 100% behind us.

24:54.840 --> 24:55.921
Really?

24:56.000 --> 25:00.244
Erin, this is what we have dreamed about
since we were little kids.

25:00.360 --> 25:04.843
I know that if you come and join us here,
they are gonna be so pumped.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.446
We just have to go upstairs
and ask for more money.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.490
I just honestly didn't realize
your department still existed.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.086
- What?
- Come on, ghosts?

25:13.160 --> 25:18.451
I will not let the 12-year reputation of
this fine institution be besmirched by you!

25:18.840 --> 25:22.561
Come on! Suddenly this place
has a classy reputation to uphold?

25:22.640 --> 25:25.450
You're only dean now
because the last dean went to jail.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.329
Are you saying that I'm not qualified?

25:27.400 --> 25:29.607
You spell science with a "Y."

25:29.680 --> 25:33.446
And what's upsetting about that is
I don't think you know that that's wrong.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.683
This is an institution of higher learning.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.649
And if you guys want to study "ghosts,"

25:38.720 --> 25:42.281
do it somewhere else,
because I have two words for you.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.805
Let me guess, "Get out"?

25:43.880 --> 25:46.531
- No, he's gonna say "suck it."
- He's not gonna say "suck it."

25:46.760 --> 25:48.171
Suck it.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.806
- You were right.
- You know...

25:49.880 --> 25:51.041
My gosh.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.326
I think it might be a ghost.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.290
No, it's not. It's just a bird.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.691
Bye. There's the door.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.967
Later days. Can you hear this?
Let me turn it up.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.811
Oh, my God.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.407
This is incredibly immature behavior.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.241
Caught it.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.004
Just a minor setback.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.401
You know what, guys?
I think we can really do this.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.643
We can become the first scientists to prove
the existence of the paranormal.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.922
All we have to do is
find an entity and capture it

26:20.000 --> 26:23.004
and bring it into a controlled environment.
That's all!

26:23.400 --> 26:26.609
Hey! There's the Erin I remember.
Welcome back.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.808
- Thank you.
- Nice.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.564
Okay, we should probably
get this equipment out of here.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.768
- They're gonna want it back.
- I thought this stuff was yours.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.966
- All stolen.
- No...

26:34.040 --> 26:36.327
Hey! That worthless garbage
belongs to this school!

26:36.720 --> 26:38.290
Scatter! Scatter! Scatter!

26:38.920 --> 26:40.285
Go, go, go, scatter!

26:46.840 --> 26:49.047
Hey. Good morning.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.451
Okay.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.207
Hey, how you doing, sir? Got a Metro...

26:53.280 --> 26:56.523
Hey. That's a dope jacket, man.
I got that jacket.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.887
You know what? It's a sweater.
I made a mistake.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.291
You have a good day, all right?

27:01.520 --> 27:03.204
Hey! How you doing, man?

27:03.280 --> 27:04.850
They'll always ignore you.

27:04.920 --> 27:09.847
They are walking sewage, concerned
only with their own trivial matters.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.201
Okay.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.611
When the Fourth Cataclysm begins,

27:12.680 --> 27:16.730
laborers, such as yourself,
will be among the last led to the butchery.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.007
So, make the most of your extra time.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.121
You are just a bundle of joy, ain't ya?

27:23.200 --> 27:25.646
You have a good day with your crazy ass.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.290
I wonder what train he taking.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.289
Is he going on the tracks?

27:34.840 --> 27:35.841
Man...

27:42.200 --> 27:44.362
You want to use the bathroom,

27:44.440 --> 27:47.683
there's a perfectly nice bathroom
upstairs at Starbucks.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.251
Hey, hey!

28:08.320 --> 28:10.402
Hey, you're not supposed to be
down here, man. Only subway...

28:32.200 --> 28:34.441
What in the sweet hell?

28:37.680 --> 28:38.920
Exquisite.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.562
I'm cool, dude. Yeah.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.881
Forget this, man!

28:48.960 --> 28:51.201
Forget this!

29:00.120 --> 29:02.407
Aldridge Mansion? Check.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.162
Seward Street subway station?

29:05.240 --> 29:06.321
Check.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.530
Well done, Rowan.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.768
But still so many more checks to go.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.730
You have been bullied your entire life.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.602
Now you will be the bully.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.125
Trust in your abilities,

29:21.200 --> 29:24.807
and the universe shall bend before your will.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.681
Hey, weirdo.
We got a clogged toilet in 1843. It's bad.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.922
I mean, like, biblically bad. Get on it.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.681
Absolutely.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.603
Nothing would make me happier.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.923
Whatever, freak show. Just do it.

29:39.920 --> 29:44.209
And the universe shall bend before your will.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.849
Charge the lines.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.321
Create the vortex.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.121
Break the barrier.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.891
I found a fantastic spot for your business.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.291
It's more of a research lab.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.248
- What do you think?
- That's it?

30:00.360 --> 30:01.885
Let's go see your new home.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.801
- Oh, my God! Look at...
- Look at it!

30:03.880 --> 30:05.769
- Look at how high!
- Look at the amazing spread!

30:05.840 --> 30:07.490
Look at the ceiling to the floor height!

30:09.440 --> 30:11.249
Look at this. Look at it.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.761
It's perfect.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.569
- We got tons of space.
- Stripper pole!

30:15.720 --> 30:17.210
- We'll take it.
- Great.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.931
- The rent is $21,000 a month.
- Fuck you.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.651
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. That's the rent?

30:22.720 --> 30:24.563
- Yeah.
- Who can afford that?

30:24.640 --> 30:25.971
All your friend said was that

30:26.040 --> 30:28.281
you were looking for a place
to explore the unknown.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.089
Okay, we need to explore
something a lot cheaper.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.361
There's an upstairs!

30:31.440 --> 30:33.408
Are you offended by the smell
of Chinese food?

30:36.080 --> 30:39.721
I have now moved above you,
and you still can't help me out.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.043
How does it take you an hour
to go up one flight of stairs?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.451
I have really bad knees.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.926
You know what?

30:46.560 --> 30:47.527
What is that?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.523
It's our hot and sour shrimp soup.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.207
That looks like dishwater and one shrimp,
and I think it's...

30:53.280 --> 30:55.169
I hope that's a water chestnut.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.524
We're dancing? Okay.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.200
Let's be safe, though.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.970
Holtz. Holtz. Holtzmann!

31:24.040 --> 31:25.451
Fire!

31:26.320 --> 31:27.970
Over towards the fire.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.767
Thank you.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.811
I hate to DeBarge in.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.563
- She loves that.
- Is that by DeBarge?

31:40.640 --> 31:41.766
I thought it was Devo.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.047
Anyway, I got the website up.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.043
I passed out a bunch of these fliers
all over town,

31:46.120 --> 31:47.929
so I'm drumming us up a little business.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.004
"If you see something, say something."

31:51.080 --> 31:52.730
- It's catchy.
- It's good.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.009
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- I think it might be the anti-terrorism slogan.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.491
God.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.122
- It is, isn't it?
- It is. I'm sorry.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.282
Well, I guess now we know
why so many people are calling

32:02.360 --> 32:04.488
about suspicious-looking bags.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.446
Dang it.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.522
- I love the green paper!
- Thank you.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.681
Hey. I'm here about the receptionist job.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.322
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.244
Is this a big ol' robot?

32:18.720 --> 32:19.846
What?

32:19.920 --> 32:22.764
The receptionist job that was in the paper.
That's what I was here about.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.205
You're hired.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.967
Okay, I... God, you're all sweaty.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.646
I think I got it.
"If there's something strange in the..."

32:37.040 --> 32:38.041
Kevin. Right?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.121
- Kevin.
- Yeah.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.565
Abby. We spoke on the phone.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.766
- We did. Yeah.
- Hello there.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.080
- Okay.
- Kevin.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.884
That's a manly name.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.406
My name's Erin. With an "E."

32:48.480 --> 32:50.687
For "everything you want."

32:51.880 --> 32:54.042
Okay. Well, we should probably...

32:54.960 --> 32:56.166
Should probably get started.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.163
Erin? Do you want to join us?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.641
- Yes.
- Erin.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.165
I've got some questions.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.522
Okay. Here we go.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.285
Let me just get to my notes.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.366
Okay.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.408
All right, first off, I just want to say...

33:11.480 --> 33:14.086
You know, we should probably start with
a very important question

33:14.160 --> 33:17.721
that we're asking all of the applicants.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.326
You know, are you seeing anyone right now?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.567
- Seeing anyone?
- Yeah.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.086
- Just for business purposes.
- Business purposes only.

33:26.760 --> 33:27.966
Well, I'm seeing all three of you.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.486
In front of me.

33:30.560 --> 33:34.690
Just forget she even asked, because
if she did, that would be illegal, so...

33:35.000 --> 33:36.001
Forgotten.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.081
Good.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.128
No, I've forgotten.
I don't know what you asked.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.641
There we go.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.530
Jillian Holtzmann, Radio Times.

33:43.600 --> 33:47.321
What have you been doing
with your whole life?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.526
Great question.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.841
Well, lots of different jobs.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.521
I did the "actor thing."

33:54.120 --> 33:56.122
- Worked for...
- I'm just gonna... Just real quick.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.802
Can I ask why no glass?

33:59.480 --> 34:02.450
Yeah. They just kept getting dirty,
so I took them out.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.127
- That's...
- Don't have to clean them anymore.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.201
- Oh, boy.
- And I can just...

34:05.280 --> 34:07.282
- I got to try to keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.726
Would it be okay
if I bring Mike Hat to work sometimes?

34:09.800 --> 34:11.882
He has major anxiety problems.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.482
You know what? I would love
to let your cat live here with you,

34:15.560 --> 34:17.880
but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.571
No, I don't have a cat.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.210
He's a dog. His name is Mike Hat.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.603
Your dog's name is My Cat?

34:24.679 --> 34:26.170
No, Mike Hat.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.481
Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.324
Well, his full name is Michael Hat.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.087
I can't say that I'm allergic to dogs, so...

34:33.159 --> 34:34.889
It's all right. He lives with my mum.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.007
- Well, then we have that figured out.
- Okay. That was...

34:37.080 --> 34:39.161
One down. No cat.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.641
But you know what I say, let's jump ahead.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.487
Kevin dabbles in web design.

34:44.800 --> 34:48.360
And I asked him to throw together
maybe a couple of logos for us.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.811
- You want to see them?
- Now is your moment.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.085
Pull it out.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.841
Sure.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.600
You're like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.485
Here we go.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.766
Okay, so...

34:59.440 --> 35:00.930
What do you think of that?

35:03.360 --> 35:06.921
Yeah, you do see how this
might make us look bad, right?

35:07.680 --> 35:10.206
Is it the boobs you don't like?
'Cause I can make them bigger.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.964
No, I can see them.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.202
Ghost Tits was my nickname
in middle school.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.327
Right?

35:15.400 --> 35:17.607
You know what? I think
it's not always about the end result.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.091
It's about the journey.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.605
Well, what about this one?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.685
I think that's already a thing.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.807
What, 7-1-1?

35:26.880 --> 35:28.006
It's 7-Eleven.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.491
Yep, it is. I have another option, though.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.050
- Okay, please.
- It's this one.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.241
That's one of my favorites.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.125
I think you might've made a mistake.
I don't think that one's for us.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.645
No. No, that's for you.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.805
You know, I just thought the floating hot dog
implies that a ghost is holding it.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.765
Your work is more cerebral than I expected.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.321
Still, so many questions about that choice.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.007
First one is, why a hot dog?

35:52.240 --> 35:54.083
I just like them.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.722
Both food groups, all in one.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.688
Dogs and buns.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.165
- Those are great.
- Yeah.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.483
We're actually gonna
discuss everything just for a second,

36:04.560 --> 36:06.210
so if you could just stand over there,

36:06.280 --> 36:08.169
- we just need to convene for a moment.
- Okay.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.685
- Sure. All right.
- Thank you.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.041
Just go right over there.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.246
Don't listen.

36:12.880 --> 36:13.881
I won't.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.927
He covered his eyes.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.325
Guys, look, as much as
I would like to have him here to look at...

36:21.400 --> 36:22.640
What?

36:23.240 --> 36:24.890
You don't find him attractive?

36:25.480 --> 36:26.527
Kevin?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.650
God, no. Poor guy.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.444
- I don't know, guys. I don't know.
- Come on, Erin.

36:34.520 --> 36:35.965
We need help around here.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.769
We cannot keep carrying
that equipment up here.

36:37.880 --> 36:41.009
And I know the phones aren't ringing
off the hook right now, but they will be.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.923
You know,
an aquarium is a submarine for fish.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.490
Listen, let's just see
how the rest of the day goes.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.849
You know, talk to other people, and we will
hire who is most qualified, okay? Deal?

36:48.920 --> 36:51.161
There are no other people.
He's the only applicant.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.241
Excellent.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.884
God, that's loud.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.610
- It's loud.
- It's loud.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.601
Kevin. You got the job.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.250
- Welcome aboard.
- Cool.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.886
Can I bring my suitcases up?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.291
Yep, you sure can.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.921
Look at him.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.047
Ma'am?

37:11.120 --> 37:14.442
Hi, ma'am. If you're waiting for takeout,
you should really wait downstairs.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.286
This... The magazine was here,
so, I don't know,

37:18.360 --> 37:20.488
I just thought that might be
your waiting room.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.767
You know, fun fact about this place,

37:22.840 --> 37:25.411
that this building is built in the same place

37:25.480 --> 37:29.007
as the first Chinese gambling den
in New York. Did you know that?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.447
I mean, it's, like, coincidence.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.211
Also, I got chased by a ghost.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.561
What?

37:36.640 --> 37:39.405
You know, up above us
was the old New York prison.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.563
It's the first place in New York
that they electrocuted people.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.041
I'm telling you, it used to take so long

37:45.120 --> 37:48.044
that they'd just be like, "Shoot him.
We using too much electricity."

37:48.160 --> 37:50.561
That's why I knew something weird
was going on down here, man.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.481
Did you see that?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.286
- Yes. I saw that.
- Did you see that?

37:56.360 --> 37:58.249
- That wasn't me.
- I saw that quite a bit.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.087
Wait, wait. Hey! Seriously? For real?

38:01.160 --> 38:02.286
'Ey. Come on, man.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.927
- Didn't I tell you?
- Is he down here all the time?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.128
He think this is his art studio.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.851
No, no. My studio is in SoHo.
This is more of a gallery.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.160
Okay, hello there.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.003
Have you seen a Class 4, semi-anchored
entity anywhere in the vicinity?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.162
- You talking like a boat?
- Can you speak English?

38:18.240 --> 38:20.288
- I'm being specifically clear.
- Let me. Let me.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.971
Hi. Have you seen a ghost down here?

38:23.040 --> 38:24.280
- Okay, that's clearer.
- Yeah.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.089
- Yeah, I've seen a ghost.
- You, too?

38:26.160 --> 38:27.127
Yeah.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.844
Would you be able to describe it to us?

38:30.840 --> 38:31.887
- Thank you.
- But...

38:32.200 --> 38:33.406
Come on, man. Come on, man.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.766
No, no, no, no. Let him, let him...

38:34.840 --> 38:35.807
- I'll take a visual.
- No! I can't let him.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.881
This is my job. I'm gonna get fired!

38:37.000 --> 38:38.286
- We want the visual!
- No, no, this is very helpful.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.964
This is not helpful for me.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.088
'Ey. Look at me. Stop.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.523
- Stop painting.
- I'm so sorry.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.647
I don't like this on my wall.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.761
You don't want it here anymore?

38:47.840 --> 38:49.842
- I don't want this ghost on my wall.
- No ghost.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.160
- Let me fix this, then.
- Well, I...

38:51.240 --> 38:52.241
No ghosts allowed.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.765
- You know what? You know what?
- Right?

38:53.840 --> 38:55.080
- Get your ass up out of here.
- Come on.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.286
Bye, Patty!

38:56.360 --> 38:57.805
- I love you.
- Man!

38:57.880 --> 38:59.370
This ain't art!

38:59.800 --> 39:01.086
And y'all encouraging him.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.491
Come on!

39:04.480 --> 39:05.606
Come on!

39:07.800 --> 39:10.246
Am I on crack, or is that a good logo?

39:10.800 --> 39:12.962
Guys, I cannot do it by myself.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.771
This equipment is untested
and highly unstable.

39:16.360 --> 39:19.967
All right, ladies, we got a limited window
for when the next train arrives,

39:20.040 --> 39:21.087
I'm telling you.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.321
And don't touch the third rail

39:22.400 --> 39:25.643
unless y'all little dainty ass
can handle 750 volts.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.164
- Come on.
- You know what?

39:30.240 --> 39:33.244
I should've gave you some coveralls, man.
It's so unsanitary down here.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.405
You know, you don't usually think about
the amount of urine smell.

39:37.520 --> 39:41.002
That's pretty much how it's gonna be.
It's not gonna freshen up at all.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.650
Oh, boy. Okay.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.162
Definitely got something over here.
Look at... Is that...

39:45.240 --> 39:46.366
What is that, a burn?

39:46.440 --> 39:48.090
That's where I saw that weird sparking thing.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.281
What was it?

39:49.360 --> 39:52.603
Baby, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't say "a weird sparking thing."

39:52.720 --> 39:54.802
You're mouthy. I like that.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.047
It looks like fission scorch.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.771
What? Fission scorch down here?

40:00.840 --> 40:02.171
Except that you're right.

40:02.240 --> 40:05.528
What is... Wait, I'm smelling
both electrical discharge

40:05.600 --> 40:07.204
- and isotopic decay.
- Isotopic decay.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.770
How is that... Holtzmann?

40:08.840 --> 40:11.081
- Yeah. What?
- Come here. I need your snoot on this.

40:11.960 --> 40:12.961
Am I nuts?

40:13.160 --> 40:14.161
'Ey, 'ey, ladies.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.050
While y'all over there making out
with that dirty piece of garbage,

40:17.120 --> 40:18.849
we only got a couple of minutes.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.240
Do you see that?

40:22.320 --> 40:23.970
- The eyes.
- All right, Holtzmann.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.361
- Now is not the time to be messing with...
- No.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.370
Cream and sugar.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.291
Hey, Patty, can I get some
illumination on this subject?

40:34.440 --> 40:35.521
Yeah, I can put some light on that.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.091
Oh, boy!

40:38.160 --> 40:41.084
That is more and more unsettling.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.686
That's the dude I saw!
I'm telling you, that's him!

40:43.760 --> 40:45.000
We got another Class 4,

40:45.080 --> 40:48.289
and this one's even more ionized
than the one at the Aldridge Mansion.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.362
Where are these ghosts coming from?

40:50.440 --> 40:52.124
You know what?
I got to get this thing on film.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.201
- Holtzmann?
- Yup.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.327
- Power us up.
- Okay.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.767
'Cause we are taking this pretty boy
back to the lab.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.367
This is a little rough.
It's in its early stages. Got to be honest.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.249
Just gonna plug these things in here.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.766
- Okay, Erin, come here.
- Let me document this.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.447
- Grab it, grab it.
- Wait.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.682
That's gonna shoot a proton stream
at that ghost, okay?

41:08.760 --> 41:10.683
So whenever I say, "Go," you just do that.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.888
Why am I operating
the untested nuclear laser?

41:12.960 --> 41:14.485
You have the longest arms.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.891
You guys might want to hurry up.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.770
Oh, my God. I forgot the most important part.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.251
Yeah. Sorry.

41:20.320 --> 41:23.961
Erin, this is just a little bit of grounding
so you don't die immediately.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.405
Do you know your iron level?

41:26.760 --> 41:27.921
It's fine.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.525
You have done this before, right?

41:30.600 --> 41:31.931
Okay, Erin, on my cue.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.645
Aim the barrel at him.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.407
Ready, aim, fire!

41:41.640 --> 41:43.563
Okay, this is a little underwhelming.
Can we get more power?

41:43.640 --> 41:44.971
And once again, fire!

41:46.680 --> 41:48.170
This isn't working!

41:48.960 --> 41:50.883
Can this beam get any stronger?

41:50.960 --> 41:53.281
Well, not at the moment.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.010
That's the train! We got to move!

42:02.120 --> 42:03.645
Just try to lure him back to the platform!

42:05.120 --> 42:06.201
Grab her!

42:06.520 --> 42:08.921
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

42:09.000 --> 42:10.001
Come on, move!

42:10.920 --> 42:13.127
- Hurry!
- That's the express train!

42:13.200 --> 42:14.770
And it's not stopping!

42:15.520 --> 42:17.045
It's coming! Get her up!

42:18.200 --> 42:19.486
Not the collar!

42:27.880 --> 42:30.247
Well, I guess he going to Queens.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.926
He's gonna be the third scariest thing
on that train.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.002
God, did you see that?

42:35.080 --> 42:37.082
You can't see anything.

42:37.200 --> 42:40.682
My God! I mean,
that power surge really held him.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.765
We need more juice.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.410
We need to be more mobile.
I know what to do.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.811
- Yes.
- I almost got killed.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.450
Yeah, I know. It was so awesome.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.521
It was awesome.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.131
Everyone thinks this video is fake.
Look at these comments.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.487
We have to bring a ghost back to this lab
and document it, you guys.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.040
I mean, this stuff is real.
We have to be able to prove it.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.043
We will. And you shouldn't
be reading this stuff.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.963
You're not supposed to listen
to what crazy people write

43:03.040 --> 43:04.201
in the middle of the night online.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.123
Look at...
"Bogus equipment"? You know what?

43:06.200 --> 43:08.601
I'd love you to meet me any place, any time.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.603
No, no, no, let's...
You're right. We should...

43:10.680 --> 43:13.160
- Here is your coffee, Abby.
- Thank you.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.129
Did you get sugar in it this time?

43:20.960 --> 43:22.166
I hate coffee.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.890
- Yeah, the sugar's in there.
- Sugar's in it.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.527
I'll take it.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.206
Don't want to waste a cup of coffee.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.491
Can we just pretend
that didn't happen, please?

43:31.560 --> 43:33.642
All right, well, what do you think?

43:33.720 --> 43:36.007
I... You know what? I just can't watch that.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.849
I'm not sure.
I mean, it's just a lot of bits and pieces.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.321
I'm pretty sure none of it is
supposed to be in the subway, though.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.846
It's like it was part
of a miniature cyclotron.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.241
And they used a chromium alloy for the hull.

43:48.640 --> 43:51.246
I would've used aluminum, but I'm crazy.

43:51.440 --> 43:54.410
What's that weird thing that guy said
to the lady from the subway?

43:55.040 --> 43:56.326
I know what you're talking about.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.323
Fourth Cataclysm. Yeah.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.485
- Hi.
- Fourth Cataclysm.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.166
Man, what they gonna do,
make a fifth one, starring The Rock?

44:03.240 --> 44:05.049
Yeah, you guys, you have a visitor.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.242
She's here to see you in the booth.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.322
Booth number one. With the earrings.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.808
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We see her now.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.006
- Thanks.
- No worries.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.286
I'm joining the club.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.408
Well, it's not really a... I'm sorry.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.968
Kevin. Hi, can you answer the phone, please?

44:21.040 --> 44:22.769
- I can't. It's in the fish tank.
- No.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.205
The one on the desk that's ringing. That one.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.850
- That one.
- Yep.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.202
- Oh, my God.
- What's this place called again?

44:28.280 --> 44:30.601
Conductors of
the Metaphysical Examination. Talk.

44:30.680 --> 44:34.002
Got it. Conductors of Metamucils and Stuff.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.962
Slow down. I... What...

44:39.360 --> 44:40.521
They hung up?

44:40.600 --> 44:42.648
No, I was just not into that conversation.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.486
Kevin, I'm really gonna need you
to try a little harder. Okay, buddy?

44:46.560 --> 44:48.927
Well, if they call back, I will.
I got to take off, though.

44:49.040 --> 44:52.010
I'm in a hide-and-seek tournament,
and we are in the semis.

44:52.080 --> 44:55.368
Kevin, I'm gonna need you
to pick up all those suitcases.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.125
Did you hurt your face?

44:58.200 --> 45:01.443
Hey, did y'all hire that big dumb dude?

45:01.520 --> 45:02.601
Bye!

45:02.720 --> 45:04.563
Man, I got a cousin Mookie.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.002
He is half as stupid,
and he will work for Vienna sausages.

45:08.080 --> 45:12.529
The thing is, this isn't really a club.
It's a scientific research group.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.967
And I understand that,
but let me tell you something.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.648
I read a lot of nonfiction,

45:17.720 --> 45:20.485
and you guys know
a lot about this science stuff,

45:20.560 --> 45:21.607
but I know New York.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.409
And check this out!

45:23.480 --> 45:25.721
I can borrow a car from my uncle,

45:25.840 --> 45:28.047
and y'all won't have to lug
all this heavy equipment around.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.083
- Guys, we got to get a car.
- Come on, baby.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.607
You need me. You need Patty.
Patty come with benefits. You need me.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.250
Stop playing like you don't.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.401
You're in.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.361
Yeah.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.525
You get a car,
and you get a car, and you get a car!

45:46.360 --> 45:50.081
You didn't disclose
that the vehicle was gonna be a hearse.

45:50.160 --> 45:54.131
I'm sorry. My uncle owns a funeral home,
not a Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.328
Hope you checked to see
there wasn't a body in the back.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.562
I don't think so. I don't really know.

45:59.640 --> 46:00.846
You didn't check?

46:00.920 --> 46:02.046
I mean, I was in a hurry.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.885
I checked to see if we had gas.
That was more important.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.007
So there is a body?

46:06.080 --> 46:08.287
Let Holtzmann check.
She likes that type of stuff.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.523
Yeah, I can think of seven good uses
of a cadaver today.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.284
No, Dr. Frankenstein,

46:13.360 --> 46:15.806
we got to turn in the body
if there's one in there.

46:16.120 --> 46:18.487
- All right.
- Don't do that.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.730
- Excuse me, maintenance man.
- Mrs. Ponner.

46:25.800 --> 46:26.961
How may I help you?

46:27.040 --> 46:31.807
Well, for starters, perhaps you can tell me
what in God's name this is?

46:32.640 --> 46:35.769
Mrs. Ponner, this is nothing more than
some leakage from our air conditioning.

46:36.320 --> 46:39.244
Well, I think it's touched my skin,
and it's given me a rash.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.891
Does it look right?

46:44.680 --> 46:46.762
Mrs. Ponner, I wanted to say no.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.282
But, yes, I'm afraid there is some redness

46:50.840 --> 46:51.841
in here.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.122
- Is it very bad?
- No.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.131
Of course not, Mrs. Ponner.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.965
But I assure you,
whoever is responsible for this

46:59.720 --> 47:03.406
will be flogged within an inch of their life
and then left on the street to die like a pig.

47:03.720 --> 47:07.805
- Well, I didn't ask for that.
- Well, in that case, I'll send up some cream.

47:21.240 --> 47:24.130
I know everyone is anxious,
but we have to be patient.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.405
Who thought it would be funny
to put Earl in that old lady's back?

47:31.080 --> 47:34.050
The guests are starting to complain.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.721
And we don't want to give away any spoilers
before the big show.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.927
See you soon.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.569
Very soon.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.246
Based on the results
of the subway field test...

47:46.320 --> 47:47.890
The one where you were
almost killed, remember?

47:47.960 --> 47:49.041
I remember.

47:49.120 --> 47:53.569
I added a booster using microfabricated
radio-frequency quadrupoles

47:53.680 --> 47:56.445
to speed up particles
before entering the DLA device,

47:57.160 --> 47:59.288
portable, wearable for maximum flexibility.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.571
Then we add the reversible
psychokinetic energy sync

48:02.640 --> 48:05.689
plus Holtzy's hollow beam to this baby,
and voilà.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.966
We got a ghost in there.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.562
- Slap me.
- Okay.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.085
I will slap you as...

48:11.480 --> 48:13.244
I just want to say
what an exciting moment this is.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.243
Holtzmann, I am beyond impressed.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.924
Abby, is that comfortable?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.048
It's a lot heavier than I expected,

48:19.120 --> 48:21.885
and I'm pretty sure
it's compacting my spinal column, but...

48:22.000 --> 48:24.082
- So you're gonna want to plant your feet firm.
- Okay.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.606
Bend your knees
to compensate for the extra kickback.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.887
All right. Turning the machine on.

48:31.200 --> 48:33.567
Boy, she's got an impressive purr.

48:33.680 --> 48:36.604
Okay, so, that little asshole over there
is the target.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.727
Okay.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.246
Just put your thumb
on that red trigger button there.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.970
- Yeah.
- And go to town.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.041
Okay.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.081
And here we go!

48:51.640 --> 48:53.483
I guess she's not
bending her knees enough, right?

48:54.720 --> 48:57.883
She's doing a marvelous impression
of a deflating balloon.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.440
We just got to let her ride it out
until she's out of juice.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.284
She's corkscrewing me!

49:02.360 --> 49:04.089
Abby, I'll make some adjustments.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.491
It's like fighting a gator!

49:11.840 --> 49:13.490
Looking forward to this metal show.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.161
Hi.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.201
Ozzy rocks!

49:18.720 --> 49:19.721
Yeah!

49:19.800 --> 49:21.165
It's...

49:21.240 --> 49:22.924
He certainly does rock.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.041
This world cannot be cleansed fast enough.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.761
Hi.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.001
Enjoy the show.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.041
Rock and roll.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.288
So, how did the two of you guys meet?

49:38.840 --> 49:41.525
Abby transferred
to my high school, junior year.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.090
Go, Karate Cats.

49:43.160 --> 49:47.006
We started telling ghost stories,
and we just kind of bonded right away.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.845
And all the other kids were, you know,
getting drunk and going to parties,

49:49.920 --> 49:51.888
and we're like, "That's stupid."

49:53.320 --> 49:54.890
Plus, we weren't invited to any parties.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.967
You know what? You know what I thought...

49:57.040 --> 49:59.122
I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm just gonna show you. You'll see.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.283
So, how did y'all get into ghosts?
Did one of you see one?

50:02.920 --> 50:04.490
Yeah, I did.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.561
Really?

50:05.640 --> 50:09.850
When I was eight years old,
the mean old lady that lived next door died.

50:10.760 --> 50:14.401
And that night, I woke up

50:14.480 --> 50:16.482
and she was standing at the foot of my bed,

50:17.600 --> 50:19.762
just staring at me.

50:22.600 --> 50:26.571
She did that every night for almost a year.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.766
What?

50:28.240 --> 50:32.165
And I told my parents,
and they didn't believe me.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.081
Still don't believe me.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.803
I had to go to therapy for years,

50:36.880 --> 50:39.770
and the kids at school found out,

50:39.840 --> 50:42.730
and they would laugh at me
and make fun of me,

50:42.800 --> 50:44.290
call me "ghost girl."

50:47.520 --> 50:49.602
Abby was the only person who believed me.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.563
Kids is mean, man. But I believe you.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.166
Thanks.

50:54.240 --> 50:56.288
- I have some questions.
- Seriously?

50:58.800 --> 51:00.404
- Okay, ready?
- Oh, no.

51:00.480 --> 51:02.528
- I found this in a box when we were moving.
- Oh, no.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.681
Oh, no!

51:05.920 --> 51:06.887
Yes!

51:07.000 --> 51:09.207
I wish we still had this presentation.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.442
I mean, it was pretty great.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.409
I kinda wish I could've seen it, man.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.562
- You might just get your wish, Patty.
- No way.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.369
Wait, you have it?

51:17.520 --> 51:19.045
Damn, I wish I hadn't wished that.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.282
Ghosts, they're real!

51:22.840 --> 51:23.841
Lord, help us.

51:28.080 --> 51:29.730
- Para...
- ...normal...

51:29.800 --> 51:31.768
- ...is...
- ...normal.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.171
And a valid science.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.686
- Thank you for requesting this.
- I...

51:36.120 --> 51:38.600
Why don't I see ghosts
flying around everywhere?

51:39.040 --> 51:40.485
The barrier stops them.

51:40.560 --> 51:44.724
It's the last line of defense betwixt
the worlds of the living and the dead.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.322
Protect the barrier! Protect the barrier!
Protect the barrier!

51:48.680 --> 51:50.330
Or mankind will end.

51:52.360 --> 51:53.930
That was really good.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.002
- That was really good.
- We actually...

51:56.080 --> 51:58.128
- That was... I'm a little proud of us.
- Yes.

51:58.760 --> 51:59.761
Rhythmic clapping.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.968
I'm so goddamn happy
you two are back together.

52:03.480 --> 52:07.883
Man, I'm gonna tell you right now, y'all,
I was hating it up until the finale,

52:07.960 --> 52:09.485
but the finale is what got me.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.130
- Guys, we're on TV.
- What?

52:11.200 --> 52:15.285
A local team of paranormal investigators
released a video of a proclaimed ghost.

52:15.560 --> 52:18.848
You can see clearly there's something
in the picture that isn't easily explained.

52:18.920 --> 52:22.129
Oh, my God! They're showing the video!
We famous! We famous.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.810
As a result, there are
a lot of questions being asked now

52:23.880 --> 52:25.689
about the people who shot the video.

52:25.760 --> 52:29.242
So, what do we think of these Ghostbusters?
Are they to be taken seriously? And...

52:29.320 --> 52:31.209
"Ghostbusters"? That is not our name.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.645
They can't just make up a name
and just call us...

52:32.720 --> 52:33.721
I spoke with Martin Heiss earlier.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.211
- He's with the Council for Logic and Data.
- Okay.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.566
- Martin Heiss. Okay, okay.
- Okay.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.371
He is a famed debunker of the paranormal.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.568
Dr. Heiss, you're a highly regarded
scientific authority.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.688
- Your credentials are impeccable.
- Thank you, Pat.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.843
If you see something
of true scientific interest in this video,

52:46.920 --> 52:50.811
that goes a long way to legitimize these
Ghostbusters and everything they stand for.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.724
A game changer, yes.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.725
So, tell me, Dr. Heiss, is this for real?

52:56.680 --> 52:58.205
Hell no.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.810
So, now we're the ghost girls.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.845
I feel your pain, Erin.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.730
No. You know what? Screw that.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.245
We are scientists.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.651
- Plus Patty.
- Thank you.

53:08.720 --> 53:11.371
Okay, we believe in provable,
physical results.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.044
- That's what we believe in.
- Yes, we do!

53:13.120 --> 53:14.281
- Preach.
- I will preach.

53:14.360 --> 53:15.566
You know what we're gonna do, ladies?

53:15.640 --> 53:17.847
We're gonna catch a ghost,
we're gonna bring...

53:18.160 --> 53:19.207
God.

53:19.280 --> 53:22.011
We're gonna catch a ghost,
bring it back to the lab...

53:22.080 --> 53:23.320
- Kevin?
- Yes, boss?

53:23.400 --> 53:24.845
Can you answer the phone
that's ringing, please?

53:24.920 --> 53:26.649
- Buddy.
- Yes, I can, boss.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.001
Ghostbusters.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.684
- "Conductors of the Metaphysical..."
- Okay.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.921
Cool. See ya.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.685
Hey, guys, which one of these
makes me look more like a doctor?

53:35.520 --> 53:38.490
Me playing saxophone
or me listening to saxophone?

53:38.840 --> 53:40.444
Who was on the phone?

53:40.520 --> 53:42.363
The Stonebrook Theatre.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.851
There's a goat on the loose.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.565
I'm gonna load up the car.

53:47.640 --> 53:48.766
Okay, okay, okay!

53:48.840 --> 53:50.285
Yo, yo, I got something for us, too!

53:52.600 --> 53:54.568
Hey, hey, hey, you guys,
I got these from work.

53:54.640 --> 53:55.846
I'm making it official, man.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.769
You put one of these on,
you won't get slimed again.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.730
- That's great.
- Yeah, we'll put them on in the car.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.888
- Okay.
- Erin!

54:05.160 --> 54:06.161
One second.

54:06.880 --> 54:07.881
Who's that?

54:07.960 --> 54:08.961
Erin!

54:11.280 --> 54:12.281
Hello, Phil.

54:12.360 --> 54:15.682
How do you just completely ignore
my calls and messages for a week?

54:15.760 --> 54:17.762
- Me? Ignore you?
- Yeah.

54:17.840 --> 54:21.526
You just stood there during the most
humiliating moment of my life.

54:21.600 --> 54:22.840
Is that her boyfriend?

54:23.520 --> 54:24.567
- No.
- Sexy.

54:24.640 --> 54:27.246
Who are you? Who are these people?

54:27.320 --> 54:29.926
You didn't tell me about
a book that you wrote,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.685
and now everyone's saying
you're some sort of crazy ghost hunter.

54:32.760 --> 54:36.128
Okay, well, first of all, that's wrong.
We don't hunt ghosts.

54:36.200 --> 54:39.488
We stalk them.
And we are very close to trapping one soon.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.930
And then we will study it
and do reports on it.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.970
Yeah, he probably dances real sexy.

54:46.040 --> 54:48.088
You know what I'm saying,
like, just a wind...

54:48.360 --> 54:50.966
I don't think his hips move at all.

54:51.040 --> 54:53.327
I think he's mechanical
from, like, the rib cage down.

54:53.400 --> 54:55.528
- No!
- I know how that guy dances.

54:55.600 --> 54:56.601
- How's he dance?
- Like...

54:57.960 --> 54:59.041
No!

54:59.120 --> 55:01.441
I'm telling you, he...
Look, I bet you he get loose and...

55:01.520 --> 55:03.488
I bet you he pop locks. I bet you...

55:03.560 --> 55:05.369
He does... No!

55:05.480 --> 55:07.926
None of that. None of that's happening.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.641
- It's rigid. It's got a lot of teeth.
- Girl. Please.

55:12.400 --> 55:13.890
And he thinks he's doing you a favor.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.803
- Man, he rip that...
- And you're like, "Get it off me."

55:15.880 --> 55:18.042
He rip that V-neck off
and he gets it busy, man.

55:18.120 --> 55:21.761
And he's got... He rips that V-neck off,
he's got another V-neck underneath it.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.004
And you know what?
I don't care that people think I'm crazy.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.320
I don't care what you think, or anyone.

55:26.400 --> 55:28.607
Because what we're doing here
is groundbreaking.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.087
It's serious. We're doing important work.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.004
Hey!

55:34.080 --> 55:35.411
Look at this beauty!

55:38.680 --> 55:41.286
Wait a minute.
What did you do to my uncle's hearse?

55:41.400 --> 55:42.401
I fixed it.

55:43.600 --> 55:47.366
He works at a funeral home!
I can't take this back with a ghost on it!

55:47.440 --> 55:49.010
It's our science mobile, I'll have you know.

55:49.080 --> 55:53.244
And I'm about to go with my science friends,
and we are about to do real work.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.891
So, good day to you, sir.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.602
- Erin.
- We gotta go!

55:58.680 --> 56:00.364
We are late. Get in here.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.522
- Not you, Phil.
- Erin!

56:02.600 --> 56:04.728
- Funny.
- Erin, we have to... This is not funny.

56:04.840 --> 56:05.841
Just get in the...

56:07.680 --> 56:09.444
- Erin, please get in.
- Holtzmann, this is not the time.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.921
You are killing me. Erin.

56:13.080 --> 56:14.320
We have fun.

56:50.440 --> 56:51.521
- Let's go.
- Let's go...

56:51.600 --> 56:52.726
- Did you want to...
- I'm sorry.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.211
- I'll let you. I'll let you.
- Next time.

57:07.760 --> 57:09.728
Are you the Ghostbusters?

57:09.800 --> 57:11.404
Actually, we're
the Conductors of the Metaphysical...

57:11.480 --> 57:13.482
We're... Yes. We're the Ghostbusters.

57:20.560 --> 57:23.564
"There's a chicken frying itself
in the library."

57:23.640 --> 57:25.768
- That is strange.
- That is not what he said.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.604
Please, follow me.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.683
Right away. Please, all of you.

57:30.800 --> 57:34.725
Fernando was down here when
something crawled out of a wall vent, and...

57:34.840 --> 57:37.081
I heard him screaming, so I went to check,

57:37.160 --> 57:41.529
and that's when the "thing" was
tossing Fernando all around the room.

57:41.840 --> 57:44.650
I thought it was gonna kill him.
I shrieked when I saw it. I...

57:44.920 --> 57:48.527
I guess I scared it, because I'm told
that I have a very disturbing scream.

57:48.920 --> 57:49.921
I could see that.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.765
Anyway, if you could just mosey around,
you'll probably bump into it.

57:52.840 --> 57:53.921
'Kay, girls?

57:54.720 --> 57:56.609
All right. Well, we know
it's down here somewhere.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.570
Let's split up, and if you see anything,
get on the walkie.

58:00.960 --> 58:01.961
Roger.

58:19.560 --> 58:21.642
Holtzmann! This is serious!

58:21.720 --> 58:24.166
And I agree. We all agree.

58:24.240 --> 58:25.765
Except for Kathy. She doesn't get it.

58:25.840 --> 58:27.171
All right, come on.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.686
Guys, I think I got
another one of those devices.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.683
I just thought this was gonna be
like a book club.

58:51.760 --> 58:53.842
Play some Stevie Nicks albums, you know?

58:54.240 --> 58:57.164
'Cause I'm telling you right now,
if I see two twins from The Shining,

58:57.240 --> 58:58.241
I'm gonna pass out.

59:01.400 --> 59:02.640
Okay, yep.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.328
Room full of nightmares. Not going in there.

59:05.400 --> 59:07.880
I don't understand
how I get wrapped up in this stuff.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.123
I had a good job at the MTA.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.484
Was it perfect?
No, of course it wasn't perfect.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.484
But I tell you what, everybody was alive.

59:20.440 --> 59:21.965
Was that there before?

59:22.480 --> 59:24.209
Please do not answer.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.645
I said, don't answer!

59:30.840 --> 59:31.887
Okay...

59:37.880 --> 59:38.881
Hi.

59:39.040 --> 59:42.010
It's a full paranormal transferal embodiment.

59:42.080 --> 59:45.243
Erin, all of our theories
on spectral possession are true.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.087
There's a ghost in that thing, and I want it.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.207
Let's light 'em up!

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.450
Run! We're gonna lose it! Come on!

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.045
- I love your fire!
- Man.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.925
Upstairs! Go, go, go! Come on!

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.570
Why fear what's around you?

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.129
It could be everything you dreamed
And it's about to be true

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.680
Yeah

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.089
Come with the one who wants to
drag you away from the shore

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.241
'Cause you're looking for more

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.810
You want some more

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.289
That's not mine!

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.522
I think those machines
are making them stronger!

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.011
That thing is super ionized!

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.570
And super not-benign!

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.211
This music is so terrible,
it's making him more angry.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.691
Play something gentle!

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.886
Behold the power of the undead!

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.527
We have summoned Satan himself!

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.968
For we are the kings of all...

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.803
- Let's do this!
- Go, go.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.120
This auditorium is Art Deco, you idiots!

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.925
Aim for the ghost!

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.211
Hey, Patty, you take that aisle.
I'll take the far one.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.329
Okay, I need y'all to get out the way!
We need to get up those aisles!

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.011
All right, move, people!
I need to get down that aisle!

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.686
If you're not gonna move,
you're gonna become part of this operation!

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.529
All right, heads up!

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.601
Come on! Move me left!

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.329
Watch the rings. Watch the rings.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.925
Okay, you sweaty freaks.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.048
I'm 'bout to save you from this ghost!

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.691
Okay, so I don't know if it was a race thing
or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.444
- Pick me up!
- All right, put me down!

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.000
Put me down! Down, down, thank you.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.451
Okay, Patty, stay still!

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.727
- You have sort of a...
- Okay, I just...

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.450
I don't need you to tell me
anything right now.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.807
- No, no, no... You got a...
- Nope.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.611
I really need you not to tell me
anything right now.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.842
- But, Patty, there...
- Hey. I'm tired.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.961
- No, no, no...
- Listen...

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.451
I'm just gonna go ahead and take off,
how about that?

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.648
No, no, no,
I don't really think that's a good idea.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.961
- Going to take off...
- Come on, Patty. Patty!

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.090
And I don't want to piss off the ghost.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.411
Moving, going back to my booth at the MTA,

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.687
so let me know if you
need some MetroCards.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.410
- Do it, do it, do it.
- 'Cause I am...

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.126
- Really?
- All right, ladies, light 'em up!

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.089
Patty, stay still.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.810
Just don't hit Patty anywhere important.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.166
- What?
- Nothing!

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.566
You gonna get it now!

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.921
Erin, I forgot to tell you, don't let
your beam get entangled with my beam.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.281
- What? Why?
- It's too much power.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.646
It would cause a counter reaction.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.281
The beam would shoot back into your body,
and each atom will implode.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.567
- What!
- Holtz, open that trap!

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.801
Okay.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.281
And I'm gonna open it on three.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.805
- Holtzmann!
- Ready?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.645
- Sweetie!
- Two...

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.848
- Open the box!
- And one. Okay!

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.888
Erin, doing great. Abby, doing great.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.803
Patty, try a little harder, okay?

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.530
Get in the box, you hellion!

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.250
Come on, we got you!

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.401
Come on.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.251
Excuse me, gotta get...
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.446
I got a ghost to get. Thank you.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.086
Did we just catch a ghost?

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.207
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.044
We put a ghost in a box!

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.207
You want some more, you want some more?

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.521
Yes!

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.648
What you're looking for
You want some more...

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.721
Right in there!

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.087
We are the Beasts of Mayhem!

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.968
Sorry, can't buy you another one.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.121
Yeah!

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.041
Wankers! Black Sabbath did that shit in '74.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.722
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.245
- My gosh.
- Thanks so much.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.970
Why are there ghosts in New York?

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.611
We made magic today,
and that's all I got to say. I'm Holtzmann.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.409
Where are these ghosts coming from?

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.570
Are there any more ghosts
inside the theater?

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.170
I think we took it out.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.241
Listen, we're scientists.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.847
We're here for the unanswerable questions
and, really, to pursue truth.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.160
We're the Ghostbusters!

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.685
Yeah!

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.161
Nope. I had him yesterday.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.447
So?

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.681
So, it's your turn.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.840
Weirdo city.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.925
Charge the lines.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.364
Create the vortex.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.530
Break the barrier.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.001
Enjoy your fun, Ghostbusters.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.729
For soon, you shall bow down before me.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.601
There he is.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.603
Come on, Kevin. Let's go.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.727
Kev.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.881
Go, Kev.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.089
Go, Kev. Go, Kev.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.161
Go, Kev.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.801
Stop, Kev.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.405
- Watch it!
- Stop, Kev.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.364
- Watch it.
- Stop it, Kevin.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.926
Please.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.245
Get it. Get it.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.485
This is so good. We have to celebrate.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.483
- Come on! This is what...
- You're right, you're right.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.085
- Yep.
- ...legit feels like.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.161
- Right here. This.
- Yep.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.446
Oh, my God.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.083
You have to stop kissing this.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.209
That... It just makes me feel
so warm and tingly inside.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.044
That's probably the radiation.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.281
Hey, guys, I got some pretty cool stuff
cooking up over here,

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.368
if you want to just turn your head.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.525
I got some newly printed circuit boards,
and I rebuilt the superconducting magnets.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.840
I improved beam accuracy

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.161
by adding a plasma shield
to the RF discharge chamber.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.408
I have cryocooler to reduce helium boil-off,

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.166
and to top it all off,
we got a freakin' Faraday cage

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.368
to attenuate RF noise and avoid quenching.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.521
- Nice!
- All right!

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.568
There's a Smartin Christ here to see you.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.651
Smartin Christ?

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.001
Wait, are you saying "Martin Heiss"?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.570
- Doctor...
- No. No.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.808
Dr. Martin Heiss, the famed scientist
and paranormal debunker?

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.848
- He's in this building right now?
- Yeah, that guy.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.964
Okay, you tell him that we're not here.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.042
- Wait, what? What?
- I don't want to talk to him.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.121
They're not here.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.402
Dr. Heiss, hello. Welcome. Dr. Erin Gilbert.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.724
Is this a good time, Doctor,
or is this dinner rush?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.324
Why don't you call
and make an appointment?

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.606
It's actually a perfect time.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.890
We were just
doing some experiments over here.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.569
Yes, please, have a seat.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.005
Let's start light and easy.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:17.087
Why are you pretending to catch ghosts?

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.803
You know, it's really easy
to just sit there and be the naysayer,

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.689
when you don't actually do anything.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.651
You know that we only comprehend
about 4% of the universe.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.006
4%!

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.686
- Across the board! It's four!
- Abby, Abby...

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.525
We all believe in the scientific method.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.329
I've dedicated my life to it.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.931
And we have actually done it.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.807
Today, at 4:32 p.m.,

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.249
we successfully trapped a Class 3 vapor.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.481
You're telling me

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.691
there is a ghost

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.489
inside that thermos?

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.608
- In that can?
- Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.330
Booyah. Emphasis on the "boo."

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.602
Well, I would love to see that.
I really would.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.929
Shoot. You know what?
You're not gonna get that treat today.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.641
We're still assessing what type
of containment method we're gonna use.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.690
We're testing the lab... In the...

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.330
So, till we figure out
how to best keep the entity,

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.800
that's not gonna happen.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.325
How's that for my timing?

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:21.925
I come.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.321
You've caught a ghost. I can't see it.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:27.006
Look, I know it probably
sounds like we're making this up.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.167
- Yeah.
- It sounds crazy,

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.131
and we probably don't really look like
legitimate scientists.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.645
No, you only lack the proper equipment,

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.883
like a garbage truck
to hang on to the back of.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.607
Said the guy with
the walking stick and the floppy hat.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.886
It was my mother's.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:46.725
Yeah, that is an awesome hat.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.246
All right, man. Thanks for stopping by.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.241
Well, I guess the graciousness has run out.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.807
You want to see it?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.884
I would love to see it.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.086
Well, he can't see it.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.527
I'm going to show it to you, then.
How about that?

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.523
- Gear up, you guys.
- No, you're not. Don't.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.285
Excuse me. Why are you doing this?

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:08.850
Because he doesn't believe us.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.685
Erin. Come on, we have finally succeeded

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.240
at doing the thing that we have talked about
since we were little kids.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.921
And you want to risk it all, what, for him?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.764
Who cares if you impress him?

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.451
Golly, you two are something.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.361
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:24.965
- I don't...
- Okay.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.359
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- All right.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:27.600
It's okay.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.247
Attagirl!

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:32.367
Sorry. I did it. I'm sorry.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:33.527
- My God!
- I know!

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.442
Casper?

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.600
Man!

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.923
Hey, that man went out the wrong door.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.930
Oh, my God.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.761
He wasn't really Ghostbusters material.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.530
Who threw him out the window?

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.682
A ghost threw him out the window.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.081
You mean like Patrick Swayze?

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.969
Like, he's sitting behind you,
making some pottery?

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.804
Yeah. Like Patrick Swayze.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.202
That's it. Then we were all dancing
at a summer camp in the Catskills.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.282
And then we sat down,
and he was behind me,

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.407
and we made a vase.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.606
You're combining the two...

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.364
- I combined a couple of Swayze movies.
- Yeah.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.726
You know what was a good one? Road House.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.040
I loved Road House.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.201
- Point Break.
- He was a...

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.361
Point Break.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.845
Come on. At the end with the big wave?

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.046
He was a ghost in that, too!

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.281
Well, you don't know if he dies at the end.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.801
He doesn't die.
He doesn't die. They don't say he dies.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.086
Well, now what?

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.566
- Who are you guys?
- Official business.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.051
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.366
- What?
- You need to come with us.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.407
- What?
- Why?

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.811
The mayor needs a word, ladies.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.846
So it's tandem parachuting.
So you'd be with an instructor.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.401
The little spoon.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.131
- And who is on top?
- The instructor.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.571
Mayor.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.881
Hey! There you are.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.770
Welcome. Sorry for the mess
and for the drama.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.683
Please, come sit down. Take that one.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.808
Good. That's right.
And, you, that's a good one for you.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.326
And take the end seat. Good.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.801
That's not so good.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.609
No feet on the table, please.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.170
Sir, we don't have a lot of time.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.446
- And we're not frauds.
- No.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.885
- We are legitimate scientists.
- Let me interrupt you.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.405
We know you're not frauds,

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.006
because we have been monitoring
this situation quite closely.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.243
Agents Hawkins and Rorke
are with Homeland Security.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.405
So we've been investigating
this extremely quietly.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.041
- Okay.
- So, what do you know?

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.371
We believe that someone is creating a device

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.761
that attracts and amplifies
paranormal activity.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.968
And that activity can be escalating now

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.520
and giving us an even larger scale event.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.568
"Larger scale." Well, that sounds terrible.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.482
Okay, well,
you've been doing great work. Well done.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.881
We really appreciate it,
but it's time to knock it off.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.324
- What?
- Knock it off.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.324
No, I heard you and I see the hand gesture.
What does...

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.641
These gentlemen are on it.
Let the government do their work.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.282
We're just worried that you all
are drawing a lot of attention...

01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.885
- Exactly.
- ...to yourselves.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.047
What?

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.043
- Patty does wear big earrings.
- Patty.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.206
Well, if it's a crime to look good,
guilty as charged.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.523
Other than that, I feel like
we keep a very low profile.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.204
You drive a hearse with a ghost on it,

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.760
and you use a distinctly
un-American-sounding siren.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.841
We do.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.570
Do you have any idea
how many federal regulations

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.165
you're breaking on a daily basis?

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.605
- One?
- No.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.684
- Two?
- No.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.761
Is it one?

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.410
Just sit quietly.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.925
Here's the essence of the deal.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.924
We are gonna have to
make the public believe

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.331
that you are frauds.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.364
- What? Wait. Why?
- What?

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.886
The human brain, you know,
it can only handle so much.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.043
If everybody knew what was going on,
you know, there'd be a panic.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.762
So, we need to get the information out there
that the incident at the concert was a hoax.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.165
'Cause, otherwise, there'd be mass hysteria.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.485
We don't want mass hysteria either.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.370
Our main concern is that
we're allowed to continue our work.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.171
- Yes, that is very important.
- Very important.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:03.089
But my concern is, I feel like the cat is sort of
already kind of out of the bag.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.562
I think what they're saying is
the cat is out of the bag.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.122
They want us to put the cat
back inside the bag.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.281
No, I know that's what they're saying.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.408
- But I'm saying the cat's already out.
- I know. I know it's out.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.244
- So it's hard to put the cat back in.
- It's not impossible.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.243
- But that's why they have that saying.
- It's a nonsense saying.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.970
If the cat is outta the bag,
you can't put it back in!

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.081
I put a cat in a bag all the time.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.161
But once the cat is out of the bag,

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.401
aren't you like, "The cat is out of the bag!"

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.528
We just want to
shove that damn cat back in the bag.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.409
The cat has been out of the bag before,

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.006
and yet, people lose interest
and put it back in.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.481
People always move on.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.723
Sheriff in New Mexico
reports a UFO encounter.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.088
The crew of the SS Ourang Medan
dies mysteriously.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.687
The entire town of Langville, Montana,
goes missing.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.206
It does?

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.327
Okay, but he...

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.324
We're talking about relocating.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.603
No one's being killed here, right?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.764
They were turned inside out.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.241
Their skin is on the inside of their body?

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.530
Their skin is on the inside of their body
because their organs are on the outside.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.206
But they're okay, right?

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.767
Sure.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.690
I think they're dead.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.204
On that horrifying note,
thank you all so much for coming.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.851
Call this number if you have any more info.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.764
When it comes to these ghosts,
we'll take it from here.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.121
The US government
doesn't need the help of hobbyists, okay?

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.409
So go back upstairs to
your little dim sum tea party, okay?

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.723
And leave it to us. We're the big dogs.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.406
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.401
Meatheads.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.566
- Unlock it. Unlock it.
- Okay, wait. Hold on.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.651
Roll your window up.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.241
I'm watching you.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.926
You think they got genitals in there?
Or is it more of a Ken doll situation?

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.406
I'm watching you!

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.241
I'm gonna go with Ken doll situation.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.001
It's smooth.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.528
We're watching you!

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.846
Now, the mayor said we could
continue our work, and so we shall.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.967
We got to be prepared.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.930
That's why I've made a table of treats.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.729
Erin, you've had a hard day. Step right up.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.040
Pick a gun, any gun.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.161
No!

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.850
I'm sorry, not that gun.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.888
That one's not ready. It's yours when it is.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.325
Here, in the meantime...

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.281
This.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.645
What does it do?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.290
It's a Swiss Army knife.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.408
No woman should walk around unarmed.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.046
I know what it does.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.521
- Also, here, why don't you take this.
- Yeah?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.610
Give that a toss.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.648
That's gonna send up a little poof.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.728
It's only dangerous to ghosts.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.165
- All right.
- Okay.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.167
Nice!

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.681
Yeah, my mistake. It was a medium poof.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.008
This puppy I like to call a Ghost Chipper.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.005
Hollow-laser technology,
sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.084
Step up to bat and do what you're gonna do.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.006
You truly scare me.
I just want to let you know that.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.691
I'm gonna just...

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.447
Come on!

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.841
It's like Mardi Gras in there.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.490
It's a proton glove.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.769
It's gonna maximize flexibility
during hand-to-specter combat.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.922
Just give it a punch, it's motion-activated.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.610
Okay. That

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.965
was awesome!

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.683
- No, that is a deadly high five.
- No.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.125
- No.
- Hey, ladies,

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.407
I'd call this a successful test.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.931
It's fraudulent and unsafe, frankly.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.085
You know, these Ghostbusters
are creating an unnecessary panic

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.924
- in a sad grab for fame.
- It's fine.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.401
People can rest assured
that these women are fake.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.687
Damn.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.967
- My favorite acid.
- It's okay. I'll get it. I'll get it.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.041
Be careful.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.325
Hey, guys, I've been meaning to ask,

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.801
what was that thing that threw that man
out the window the other day?

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.689
Kevin, it was a ghost.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.366
- A ghost?
- Do you not know what goes on here, Kevin?

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.601
Okay, I've got it.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.926
We sell the restaurant.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.684
Guys, we haven't had customers, anyway.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.650
It's time to face the facts,
the restaurant is not working.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.085
You're standing in the acid.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.208
- Not my slippers.
- It's hydrochloric acid.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.169
Get the baking soda. There you go.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.004
That's how you clean up hydrochloric.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.081
Good boy.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.528
- Oh, God, it stinks.
- Just a big, beautiful dummy.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.570
Well, it's official.
We're all ghost girls now.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.127
Can't see.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.646
- Well, that's the acid.
- Get back to the eyewash station.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.451
- Where is that?
- Back by the bathroom. Left.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.561
There you go.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.850
Stop when you hit something.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.206
- Okay.
- Jesus.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.281
Good job.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.286
All right, I would like
to remind everybody here

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.767
that in a very short amount of time,

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.128
we have seen
multiple Class 4 malevolent apparitions.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.486
- Yeah.
- We did.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.449
Who cares what anybody else
is saying about us?

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.646
We know what we're doing.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.281
I mean, all morning,
I've been reading about this stuff.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.691
There's sightings all over the city.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.604
"Wailing spirit sighted at 6th and 26th."

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.127
Another one,
"Spectral polar bear on 63rd and 5th."

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.443
Then there was that weeping wall
in the thrift store at Chelsea.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.651
- Wait. Did you say 6th and 26th?
- Yeah. "Wailing spirits, 6th and 26th."

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.242
6th and 26th. 6th and 26th. Okay.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.526
6th and 26th.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.809
Aldridge Mansion. Upper West Side. Yes?
70... 72nd.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.211
Where did we find the first device?

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.971
- At the subway, right here.
- Okay.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.565
Theater. Downtown. Downtown.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.324
- Downtown?
- Yes, yes. In here.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.811
Okay, what was the other address you said?

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.326
Polar bear on 63rd and 5th Avenue.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.811
And the one in Chelsea?

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.680
- Chelsea is at 10th Avenue and 18th.
- 18th. 10th and 18th.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.046
What do those look like to you?

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.290
It's an "X." Touching other little "X's."

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.771
- Ley lines.
- Ley lines.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.001
What's "ley lines"?

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.801
It's a hidden network of energy lines
that run across the Earth.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.087
It's a current of supernatural energy.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.689
Supposedly, if you look at sacred sites
and weird events all over the world,

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.001
and connect them with lines
where they intersect,

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.651
it's an unusually powerful spot.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.881
Abby and I just dismissed this theory

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.930
because it just seemed
too random to have any merit.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.644
Dismiss this.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.089
Okay. That looks like it's got some merit.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.241
He's using the devices
to charge the ley lines.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.161
- He's creating a vortex.
- A vortex.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.841
Oh, boy.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.129
Okay, if he gets one of his machines in there
and it's big enough,

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.002
he's gonna be able
to rip a hole right through that barrier.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.242
Letting whatever's on this plane

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.722
come crashing down on this plane.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.370
Okay, I'm calling this in.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:12.328
Okay, that intersection right there
between 7th and 8th.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.482
What is there now?

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:18.481
The Mercado.
Mercado. It's Spanish for "table."

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.688
The Mercado? That actually makes sense.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.604
Okay, yes, I'm looking for
Agents Hawkins and Rorke.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.251
The Mercado has one of
the weirdest histories

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.526
of the buildings in New York.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.001
Okay, so it's your standard-issue
haunted building.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.321
No. This is even before it was a building.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.926
All sorts of massacres happened at that spot.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.721
Like the peaceful trade between
the Lenape Indians and Captain Warren.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.723
Then, all of a sudden, everybody dies.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.804
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is the dude that was at the subway

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.008
that was talking about the cataclysms!
This is him!

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.604
It's always the sad, pale ones.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.286
Okay, ladies, let's gear up
and hit that Mercado.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.171
Who's in the mood to save New York City?

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.882
And did you try adjusting the thermostat
before placing this call?

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.009
Well, I'm terribly sorry
that you have a draft in your room.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.527
Why don't you hold while I connect you
to someone who might care.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.206
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hold on.

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.362
- What do you want?
- Where's your janitor?

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.886
That nut-job! What has he done...

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.570
I don't want to know.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.928
Just take the stairs down and get him out.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.328
Hey, stop right there!

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.890
Shut it down!

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.691
The Ghostbusters.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.525
Look, I think it's great
you found yourself a little hobby,

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.410
and I'm sure, on paper,
flooding New York City with ghosts

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.811
seemed like a great idea,

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.326
but we happen to like
the world the way it is.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.166
Then you must've been afforded the basic
dignity and respect of a human being,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.366
which I have been denied.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.771
Not really.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.808
People dump on us pretty much all the time.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.570
I am a genius.
I see things that no one else does.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.884
And for it, I am rewarded
with nothing but scorn and mockery.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.248
Luckily, I am not
the only one seeking revenge.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.209
Behind these are millions of souls,

01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.805
souls which have been cast aside.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.568
Souls who see the world
as it truly is, as garbage.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.722
Garbage that needs to be cleaned up.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.690
They're mostly dudes.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.928
When these barriers are destroyed,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.085
an army of the undead
will return to pester the living.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.209
Pester the living doesn't sound so bad.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.090
They will return to pester the living
with unspeakable pain and torment.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.006
Children will be pestered limb from limb
in front of their own parents.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.721
The parents will be pestered in half
and pestered in half again.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:36.089
And pestered into the ground until their
bloody, pulpy bodies are nothing but meat.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.847
That's a different definition of "pester"
than what I was thinking.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.208
I think the word we're looking for
is apocalypse. Apocalypse.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.046
Well, let's get these barriers destroyed,
shall we?

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.167
Wait, wait, wait! Rowan.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.524
I get it. You don't like people.
People can be terrible.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.241
The thing is, though,
there's so many terrific things out there.

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.245
I mean, wonderful things
that are worth living for.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.324
I mean, you got soup,

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.247
and, you know, that first... You know when...

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.449
God. I can only think of soup.
Anybody? Somebody? Patty?

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.681
- Salad.
- Salad.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.444
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.010
Okay, stop what you're doing.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.605
The police are already on their way.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.411
It's over. You're going to jail, Rowan.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.801
Well, in that case,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.047
bye.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.441
That's a weird move.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.806
He dead. That's a dead man.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.928
See if you can shut that thing down.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.644
- Come on!
- Holtz?

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.846
Holtz, are we good?

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.610
Well, he's not, but, yeah, we're okay.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.762
Okay. Well, that's over.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.320
Okay, we're down here! Down here!

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.084
You hate to see the smart ones go bad.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.123
Man, it smells like burned bologna
and regrets down here.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.646
Like, the dude that worked here,

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.610
he, like, dressed, like,
in a Captain Kirk-type outfit.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.205
- What's up?
- He was, like, standing over here...

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.406
I don't know. It's strange.

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.290
You know, his technology's
not that different from ours.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.489
It's basically, like, we're
both using the same science.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.642
- That is strange.
- I think I know why.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.685
Look what Mr. Cuckoo Pants
has been reading at the beach. No.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.841
Oh, my God.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.844
I told you that there would be
people out there that loved our work.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.651
Why am I so flattered that
that weird little sociopath bought our book?

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.009
Thank you for everything you did.
You saved us all.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.605
The mayor thanks you, of course.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.001
Privately, so don't tell anyone.

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.047
Can I walk you out?

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.282
Well, why don't you all go get some rest?

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.011
These gentlemen here
will get you out of here. Okay?

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.246
- Thank you. That's very nice.
- All right.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.051
- Thanks for all you've done, ladies.
- Thank you very much.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.522
I just have to say a couple things
to the press. You know how that goes.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.728
So we just are gonna fake-arrest you now.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.565
And we towed your car.
Real-tow, not fake-tow.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.687
- Ms. Lynch!
- What's that?

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.609
- Ms. Lynch!
- What? Wait, why?

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.647
- Excuse me!
- Stop resisting.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.888
I'm not. I'm walking with you.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.327
- Is New York in trouble?
- Everything is fine.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:15.851
It was just another publicity stunt
by these incredibly sad and lonely women.

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.571
It's like they read Eat, Pray, Love
and just ran with it.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.922
Well, mission accomplished, ladies.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.571
I say we get some drinks and celebrate.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.563
How about it, Erin? It's my treat.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.369
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.044
A couple quick questions for my blog.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.409
First, how does it feel wasting
tax payer money and government resources

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.891
with your pranks?

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.964
Why don't you go back to
your mother's basement where you live?

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.848
Yeah, I plan to, after this.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.048
Ms. Gilbert, I asked around your hometown.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.804
I talked to somebody
you went to school with.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.121
They said when you were a kid,
you made up a ghost.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.847
So, tell me,
were you born a fraud, ghost girl?

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.607
Don't call me that!

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.205
Erin! Oh, my God!

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.884
Erin, he's too pasty to fight.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.724
Erin, you're making us look bad right now.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.802
Erin, come on, let it go.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.008
They should put you back in therapy,
you freak.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.121
Damn!

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.001
Hey.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.728
Guess whose desk I just set on fire.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.211
You'll never guess.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.171
You may guess when you see
your desk later. Okay.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.321
All right. Just read it. Just read it.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.124
"Midtown movie theater owner claims

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.444
"Basset Hound
regularly attends matinees by himself."

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.204
- Look at his ears.
- Yes, I see.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.321
I meant the one about me.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.241
Yes.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.087
It's devastating.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.121
Look, you're on TV.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.565
We spoke to Dr. Harold Filmore,

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.961
Physics Department Chair
at Columbia University,

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.451
where Ms. Gilbert used to teach.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.487
No, no.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.167
It's unfortunate that we have
these former ties with Ms. Gilbert.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.007
Here at Columbia University,
we're about real science, discovering truth,

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.961
not lying for a sad moment of fame.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.805
You know what?
They don't know what they're talking about.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.089
We also spoke with the Dean
of the Kenneth P. Higgins Institute.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.127
Oh, God.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.205
Ms. Gilbert's association with the
Kenneth P. Higgins Institute, albeit distant,

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.129
is a blight on this university.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.330
But, good news,
I have an album dropping in two weeks.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:34.290
It's called I'mma Be Me, and I wouldn't mind
playing you the title track.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.801
God.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.325
Yo, Erin, shake that off.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.640
You know how many lives you saved?

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.643
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta get out there.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.326
We gotta get something to eat.
We gotta find that Basset Hound.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.845
I'll just see you guys tomorrow.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.684
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.404
- Erin...
- I'm sorry!

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.562
So, Abby, I've been doing a lot of thinking,

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.127
and congratulations,
I've decided to become a Ghostbuster.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.841
Oh, God. I don't have time to try to explain
why that's not going to happen.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.522
I thought they would've
been happy about that.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.764
Did you guys lose your keys?

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.686
What did I tell you? Pin it to your bra strap.
That's where mine is, and it...

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.451
Who's out there?
Holtzmann, I swear to God, I...

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.090
Don't look so surprised.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.283
You didn't think I was gone when
there's so much left to do, did you, Abby?

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.009
It's brilliant, really.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:58.291
My devices energized spectral entities
on a nuclear, paramolecular level.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.440
Sound familiar?

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.003
It's the reverse of your research.

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.609
Do it in the right place, with enough power,
and there goes the barrier.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.242
And then the world shall bend to...

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.805
Okay. I apologize.
That looks nastier than I intended.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:18.561
Enjoy, Abby!

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.646
Ghostbusters. What do you want?

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.528
Hello? Guys, it's me. Are you there?
Please pick up if you're there.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.847
Call me as soon as you get this.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.402
I think when Rowan killed himself,
it was just the next step in his plan.

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.847
The mayor's itinerary has been set.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.084
Mayor Bradley is meeting with the diplomats
at Lotus Leaf this very moment.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.485
Lotus Leaf.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.369
Abby! We got you a sandwich
so you don't be picking off of ours, man.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.330
You need some food.
Your moods have been real bad, yo.

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.606
Come on now.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:06.081
Abby? You in there?

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.291
Everything okay?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.367
Abby, come and get your sandwich

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.329
Come and get your sandwich, please

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.644
You want your little sandwich?

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.210
Abby...

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.611
Hello, Jillian.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.201
Hello, Abby.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.565
Are you okay?

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.005
I'm quite well.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.891
That's good.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.971
You found my pipe.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.485
I got it at the dumpster yesterday.

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.560
I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.971
Pretty cool, right?

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.845
If it doesn't work,
we can just swing it around and break stuff,

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.524
so it's kind of a win-win.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:54.206
- What?
- What are you doing?

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.161
Not my babies!

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.326
Hey!

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.005
- Wait a minute!
- No!

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.411
Man, are y'all playing?

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.205
'Cause this ain't funny, man. Yo! For real!

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.601
See, Abby, I told you
to have that sandwich, man.

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.125
Low blood sugar is serious!

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.725
- Hello, Patricia.
- What?

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.486
Abby!

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.841
What the...

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.846
Look at the view.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.125
This is fun, right?

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.361
Good-bye.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.530
I got you, baby! I got you!

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.282
- Oh, my God, help me.
- Hi, Patty.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.284
Hell no! The Devil is a liar!

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.846
Hellion, begone!

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.091
Shit.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.801
No!

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.721
Holtzy! Got you, Holtzy!

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.441
No!

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.727
Get out of my friend, ghost!

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.530
That's gonna leave a mark!

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.206
The power of Patty compels you!

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.367
Is that you, Abby?

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.487
Where did he go?

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.925
Hey, guys, check it out!

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.161
Hey, listen.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.005
I figured you're gonna need my help,
so I borrowed all this stuff.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.924
If you could just chuck me down
my own proton pack, that'd be great.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.490
- Kevin, come inside!
- Kevin.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.681
- Come inside.
- I'm part of the team.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.921
I can help out.
I'm not gonna get in your way.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.206
- Come on, move!
- Move!

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.850
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:36.921
Nothing's gonna stop me!

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.685
- Man.
- Kevin!

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.489
Come on, Rowan, get out of him!

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.164
Thanks for the upgrade.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.091
Rowan, ya big bully!

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.003
Hope this guy knows
how to ride a motorcycle.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.406
Rowan, not Kevin!

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.600
Yeah, he does.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.285
That's so not good.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.646
No, no. It's just a magic trick.
He didn't actually cut her in half.

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:09.127
- No, no. I was there. She was cut in half.
- There's two women.

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.804
- Yeah, I saw it.
- It's just a trick.

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.811
Mayor Bradley, it's me!

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.642
Who the shit is this?

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.449
It's me! It's Erin.

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.409
She thinks that's a sliding door.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.641
It's Erin. Hi!

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.041
She thinks they're all doors. That's sad.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.565
She's a scientist.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.130
Mayor Bradley.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.291
You have to evacuate the city!

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.447
Never say that word.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.885
You have to shut down the power
to the whole city!

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.691
Don't you understand? He's using
the power to energize them!

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.081
You know what, as you can see,
the mayor is very busy.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.321
No.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.526
It's happening.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.570
Can you hear it?

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.686
It's...

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.080
Okay, that's a dumpster.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.481
But the undead are still arriving.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.925
Please, Mayor Bradley,
you have to believe me.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.490
You're the only one
that can do something. Don't...

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.011
Please don't be like the mayor in Jaws.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.921
Never compare me to the Jaws mayor. Never!

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.001
Please, you have to get everyone out.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.167
You're endangering everyone in the city!

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.401
That took way too long.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.527
What are you doing?

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.125
My... Get off of me!

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.084
Mayor Bradley, you have to listen to me!

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.050
Get out of the city! Get out of the city!

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.685
They're coming!

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.127
Don't you understand?
These ghosts kill people!

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.969
50 cents a T-shirt.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.088
My plan is to wear a new one every day,

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.482
and then just throw 'em out
and then start over every month, yeah.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.960
Hey. Man, nobody ordered
a Clark Kent strippergram.

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.246
Clark Kent?

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.407
Because of the glasses
and the handsomeness?

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.521
I should have worked out more
when I was alive.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.527
I definitely should have worked out more.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.961
You have to get out of the city!

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.769
Please! Get out!

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:48.961
No.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.285
It's happening.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.321
City College must have just let out, huh?

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.521
Yankees suck!

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.364
What the hell am I doing in New York?

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.721
Let's do this!

01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.161
Yeah.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.403
Taxi! Taxi!

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.408
- Where you going?
- Chinatown.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.847
Nah. That's, like,
one more block south than I want to go.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.491
Sir, those are actual ghosts flying around!

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.961
They're Class 5 floating vapors.
Nothing to worry about.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.247
No, no, no, it's important.
Don't you see what's happening?

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.446
Look, I don't go to Chinatown,

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.040
I don't drive wackos,
and I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:29.645
What? No, no, no, wait!

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.009
That's a double negative!

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.964
That means you are afraid of ghosts.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.291
God, I got to get my gear.

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.644
Seem to have hit an impasse.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.131
Yeah, I'd say so.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.004
All right, let's clear a path.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.322
You guys, this looks like my kitchen.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.126
What the hell is that thing?

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.120
- Hey, hey!
- Wait!

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:19.571
Really?

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.290
Did you leave the keys in the car?

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.042
My uncle is gonna be pissed.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.964
- Okay, light him up!
- No, don't shoot.

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.042
The equipment on top of that
is basically a nuclear reactor.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.361
- What?
- Okay, I vote we don't shoot at that.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.722
Well, we just gave a ghost a nuke.

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.404
We should probably run.

01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.641
Yep.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.965
Go! Go! Moving out!

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.807
Yo, was Thanksgiving
like Halloween back in the 1920s?

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.042
'Cause that's a creepy-ass Macy's Parade.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.444
I don't know. I've always kind of been
attracted to husky men in hats.

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.970
I just made eye contact.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.690
- With the balloon?
- Yeah, straight down the barrel.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:45.206
- Damn.
- I think we may look like chew toys to him.

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.329
All right, let's pop some balloons!

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.284
Lord, have mercy.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.209
This is just wrong!

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:20.807
I can't move my hand.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.962
I can't reach the trigger.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:26.883
You guys, this is exactly
how I pictured my death.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.241
Come on.

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.049
Proton guns are all well and good,

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.885
but sometimes you need the Swiss Army.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.850
Welcome back!

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.083
- Am I shouting?
- Yeah.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:52.171
I think the balloon popped my ear!

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.848
All right, let's go save this city
and get our terrible receptionist back.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.922
We're not gonna find another one that pretty.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.811
Who's the flying beefcake?

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.441
Hello.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:23.084
Dear brave men and women
of the protection services industry,

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:26.290
I would like to see you dance.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.961
Get it off.

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.121
I can't. It won't work anymore.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.883
I control all of you.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.481
This is fun.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.444
Women. Always late.

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.486
Probably couldn't decide
which dirty jumpsuit to wear.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.411
Let's give 'em a proper New York welcome,
shall we?

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.005
Welcome to the glory days of New York City.

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.127
Have fun!

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:34.051
Never been good in a fight.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.761
Well, good news.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.683
Here's your chance to work on that.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.443
Guys, you all have your sidearms.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.170
I suggest you use them.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.651
Okay, power up.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.485
Holtzy, get down! Get down!

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.601
Slap shot!

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.761
Gotcha.

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.169
This isn't very Puritan behavior!

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.320
D'oh. Nuts!

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.926
I'm getting the hang of this!

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.121
Shoot.

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:39.850
I lost my glasses!

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.207
Wait, wait, I got 'em! They're in my hand!

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.361
A little help!

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.646
Impressive.

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.884
Holtzy! I got you!

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.322
It's chipping time now, ghost.

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.607
And this is what you get for sitting on me!

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.047
Missed me!

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.201
Thanks, Patty.

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.206
Not you guys again!

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.204
Say hello to my little...

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.331
What the hell?

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.005
Forgot about my new toys.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.161
Let's go.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:12.207
You just got Holtzmanned, baby!

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.767
You know what?

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.286
I'm glad I didn't know
any of you when you were alive,

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.647
'cause I don't enjoy any of you,
especially you.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.643
Okay. All right, Abby,
let's reel it in tighter.

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.041
- I don't like you either!
- We got to save our energy.

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.610
Come on, let's go.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.967
Oh, my God, you killed a Pilgrim.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.731
It appears I did.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.162
- This is weird.
- It sure is.

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.248
Hey, why y'all like this?

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:44.970
Something's up, man.

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.529
Yeah, great work, fellas.

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.204
Your country thanks you.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.251
Well, that thing's having
the time of its life.

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:05.487
Let's go.

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:30.847
God.

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.647
It feels like the slime
is after me, personally.

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:36.406
That's all I'm saying.

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.811
This might be a crazy hunch,

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.247
but I think he's got that machine
up and running again.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.646
Come on.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.811
Damn, I missed.

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.002
Kevin!

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.969
Is that what this thing's name is?

01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.206
Thought it'd be something more Australian
like "Jack-O" or "Dave-O" or "Rob-O."

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.806
I see there's five of you now.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.886
Who are you?

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.564
I'm Frank.

01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.403
I just came down to get some ice.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.405
Get out of here!

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.171
Get out of here!

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.561
I think we should've gave him a heads up
about what was going on out there, y'all.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.288
It's been a very long day.
Why don't you take a seat?

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.801
Please, sit.

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.006
Don't mind if I do.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.481
Okay.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.249
I do appreciate the joke. It's a classic.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.651
For fun.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.446
I know you're getting real comfy
in your Kevin skin suit,

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.885
but it's time you hop out.

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.961
We like him,
despite his many, many frustrating quirks.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.646
- He just started figuring out the phones!
- Yeah.

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.681
I don't know.

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.083
Is this a little too Peter Pan?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.161
Anyway, I'll embrace it.

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:01.601
You know, to be honest with you,

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.887
this guy's making me feel
stupider by the second.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.007
He's all yours.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.966
- No!
- No, no, no!

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.649
Don't let Rowan get away!

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.609
I got his ass! Here I am.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.882
Nobody hurts Kevin, man!
Nobody hurts Kevin!

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.884
Come out, come out wherever you are

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.007
Over here.

01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.366
Those guns come with instructions?

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:28.728
Come on, Rowan! Come get your virginity
out of the lost-and-found!

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.609
- You shoot like girls.
- 12 o'clock!

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.527
I think you broke it.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.931
Look what you made me do!

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.650
It's ridiculous. Let's get Kevin.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.969
I knew he was dumb as a box of rocks.

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.486
I didn't know he's as heavy as one.
What's he made out of?

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.449
Pure muscle. And baby-soft skin.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.603
Come on, Rowan, show yourself!

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.049
What form would you prefer I take?

01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.805
Maybe something stationary.
Like a bull's-eye.

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.570
Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:04.008
I prefer something nice and cute,
like a friendly little ghost.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:06.891
Is this what you want?

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.325
Something more familiar?

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:09.966
Ice cream.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.244
Well, you know what,
I don't have no problem with that.

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.970
Thank you very much for being reasonable.

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.361
If this is what you want, it works for me.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.487
God, he's really going for it.

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.722
Man, I said cute. Cute!

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.961
God.

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.091
No. No, no, no.

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:28.201
No.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:31.165
Okay, this is not good.

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.846
Run! Run!

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.521
Come on!

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.681
Erin!

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:35.364
Okay. Homeboy is pretty much
not keeping up with what we agreed upon.

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:42.007
What part of "small and friendly"
did he not understand?

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.766
What do we do now?

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:52.764
We gotta go back there. We've got to
shoot directly in the portal with more power.

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:55.081
If we can do that, we might be able
to cause a reverse reaction.

01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.525
We gotta cross the streams.

01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:59.444
Wait, wait, wait. You mean that thing
you were talking about that's so powerful

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.284
that will make all of our atoms implode?

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.601
No, implode is the wrong word.
It'll be more violent than that.

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.047
We gotta cross 'em up,
and we've got an extremely good shot

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:09.681
at pulling all the ionized ecto-matter
back into the dimension of its origin.

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.928
So, on the plus side, we save the world.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.210
And on the negative side, we experience the
most painful death conceivable of all time.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.448
Yeah. It's hard to shine
that penny, but yeah.

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.761
Okay.

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:21.321
Let's do it.

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.085
Attagirl. Okay, let's go. Go, go, go.

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:41.251
All right, fire 'em up.

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.367
The portal's too strong.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.886
We still don't have enough power
to reverse it.

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:17.766
Yo, what about that nuclear thing
on top of the car?

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:20.844
If we can get those reactors
super-critical inside the vortex,

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.207
the beta radiation could 180 the polarity.

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.487
Causing a total protonic reversal.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.688
It's gonna turn that portal
into a giant ghost trap.

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.444
You are a genius, Patty.

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:30.920
I'm a Ghostbuster.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.563
All right, let's narrow his path.

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.085
Aim for the silver canisters.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.206
It's working!

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.287
He's too strong.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.806
We can't let the portal close
with him still here.

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:22.927
All right, ladies.

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.966
Let's loosen his grip.

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.645
Yo, that's where
you wanted us to shoot, right?

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:36.926
Yes.

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.081
Look out!

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.601
Abby!

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:08.046
The portal's closing!

01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:10.646
- Abby, hang on! I'm coming!
- What is she doing?

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.327
Hang on, Abby!

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.531
Abby!

01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:58.927
Erin.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.490
I wasn't gonna leave you twice.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.926
Yeah.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:06.761
Hold on!

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:12.163
- Oh, my God.
- We got to get 'em out of there.

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.446
We got to get 'em out of there!

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.331
Shut up!

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:41.881
Yeah!

01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:43.727
Hell yeah!

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.081
Yeah! Yeah!

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.969
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:51.081
Oh, my God!

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.401
Yeah! Yeah!

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:55.805
- What's "whoa"?
- Yes.

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.081
No!

01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.566
My...

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.760
My gosh.

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.810
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:07.120
My gosh!

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.560
What year is it?

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:10.846
- It's 2040.
- What?

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:13.207
- Our president is a plant.
- Oh, my God!

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.884
I'm kidding. You were gone two seconds.

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.325
- We did it?
- Yeah.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.249
- Yeah, you did it.
- Yep.

01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.691
- We all did it.
- We all did it.

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.444
- We all did it.
- That's right.

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:23.284
- We all did it.
- Well...

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:26.402
What did you do, Kevin?

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.686
I did a lot, actually.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.603
I'll have you know that
I walked over to the power box,

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:30.841
pushed a bunch of buttons.

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:33.491
Everything got sucked into the portal,
then it closed up.

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.846
- Kev.
- That's...

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:37.122
Sweet, sweet Kev. The two are unrelated.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:41.523
More important question.
When did you have time to get a sandwich?

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:43.961
When I was looking for you guys,
I looked in that deli over there.

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:47.681
When we were risking our lives,
trying to save New York City,

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.808
you stopped in to get a sandwich?

01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.484
Quit splitting hairs, okay?

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.170
Potatoes, tomatoes. It doesn't matter.

01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:55.004
Point is, the Ghostbusters...

01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:57.211
Are back together again, okay?

01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.441
And that's what friends are for.

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.489
- Just glad you okay, man.
- Kevin!

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.289
Yes. Hold my hand longer.

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.930
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.401
I love the hair, by the way.
Makes you look a lot older.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.561
You know what?

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:12.846
A little help, please?

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.321
Really?

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.650
Can I have the beverage, please?

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:22.721
Don't.

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.406
And a muffin, thanks.

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:29.241
Oh, my God.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.491
Are you a wizard?

01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.290
In the aftermath of the events,

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.010
authorities are still trying to understand

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:37.924
what happened in Times Square
and throughout the city.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.241
I saw Pilgrims. Ghost Pilgrims.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.206
So you're honestly gonna stand here
and tell me that we didn't all see ghosts,

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.970
that what actually happened

01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:48.771
was that terrorists drugged all of the water
with hallucinogens.

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:49.921
Yes. Yes.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.331
Wait, what?

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:53.084
- Baba Booey!
- I... I...

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:56.642
...with the government trying to claim
the event wasn't supernatural,

01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:00.008
despite so many eyewitness accounts
to the contrary.

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:01.286
The big question is,

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:05.046
was it the four women
who refer to themselves as Ghostbusters

02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.963
who actually thwarted the attack?

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.007
We may never know.

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.048
Well, now I know how Batman feels.

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:13.928
You know what?
You don't have to keep fiddling with it.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.731
I think it looks nice. Right?

02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.484
I'd talk to you at an AA meeting.

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:20.481
It's my fault, anyway.

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.210
The box said the color was called Garfield.

02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:26.166
It wasn't even the cat. It was the president.

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.527
It was part of
the Dead Presidents Color Collection.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:31.284
You stay away from Taft.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.250
That's my mother's color.
I don't want to see that on anyone's head.

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:36.482
Mine was "Woman with a Secret."

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:39.084
And she was kind of going...

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.003
And she appeared to be in a canoe.

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.082
You know what, I want to make a toast.

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:46.970
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.561
Physics is the study of
the movement of bodies in space,

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:54.968
and it can unlock the mysteries
of the universe.

02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.682
But it cannot answer the essential question
of what is our purpose here.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.128
And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:06.761
And to love is what you have shown me.

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:09.764
I didn't think that I would
ever really have a friend until I met Abby,

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:12.127
and then I feel like
I have a family of my own.

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:13.685
And I love you. Thank you.

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:15.327
Thank you.

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.171
I mean, that was like
a real thing right there.

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:19.049
- Yeah, that was...
- That was, like, so real.

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.884
I'm so sorry I'm late.

02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.444
We want to thank you for your discretion.

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.171
It's not working at all, but thank you.

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.245
Actually, we'd like you to continue
to study this subject,

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.890
fully funded.

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.089
You know, we need to be better prepared,
just in case.

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:38.810
- Yeah. Yes, that's smart.
- Yes.

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.848
Whatever you need, going forward.

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.126
Anything at all.

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.441
Anything?

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.641
Anything.

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.767
Hell yeah!

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.607
Second floor is mine.

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.523
You can't claim a whole floor.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.647
- I just did.
- You can't...

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.449
You can't do that, Holtzy!

02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.410
Not bad, ghost girl.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.562
Thank you, and I proudly take that title.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:05.884
- Is that...
- Patty's uncle.

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.361
Unc!

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.207
Where is it?

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:15.529
What are you talking about?
I told you what happened.

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.886
Where's the car?

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:19.327
- It's on the other side.
- In Jersey?

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.004
No, in the portal.

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.691
You know what? We should probably
let them just work this out.

02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:25.727
- Excuse me.
- Patty,

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:27.689
I got four funerals this weekend.

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:29.489
I can't do them with just one hearse.

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.085
Maybe you could do two at a time.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:32.685
We're not stacking 'em like flapjacks!

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.849
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.246
I know what you did.

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.641
What?

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:52.405
Bennie, don't get weird on me, okay?

02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.966
What is...

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.004
Yeah!

02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:01.369
I'm just looking for a reasonable ratio
of wontons to broth.

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.965
This is absolute madness.

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.726
Come on, girl.
You deserve every wonton in the world.

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:07.882
Don't let any man tell you otherwise.

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.961
- Okay, you can go.
- All right.

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.280
- We still good for brunch?
- Nope.

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.401
Just go.

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.923
Ghostbusters. Please give
a detailed description of your apparition.

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:32.405
Well, that sounds like

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.804
an illusional meta-physious, spectro-mian.

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.690
I'm talking like you guys.

02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:41.091
- Way to go, Kev.
- Yeah.

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:43.322
Well, that sounds very scary.

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:46.722
It's probably 'cause you got
a lot of bad karma from your previous life.

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.920
I hate coffee.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.889
I'm just gonna disconnect his phone.

02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.200
- He won't notice.
- No.

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.964
How's it going over here?

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:12.961
Good. Really good.

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:16.169
I'm working on some kind of next-level stuff.

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:17.446
Case in point.

02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:23.801
What is this for?

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.963
It catches ghosts
and it transports them somewhere else.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.371
I don't know where,

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.960
but I have a feeling it's Michigan.

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:34.050
Sorry, Lansing.

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.649
Hey, how's this containment unit?

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:49.131
You got that up and going?

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.407
That? That's going real smooth.

02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:56.210
I just would say don't be in a room with it
for more than an hour at a time,

02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:59.602
because I'm thinking a lot of hair loss.

02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:02.291
Well, that might be
something we want to work on.

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.971
Hi. Hello. Sorry, I didn't know
anyone else was here.

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.565
What a ding-a-ling. I forgot to introduce.

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:09.961
This is my mentor, Dr. Rebecca Gorin.

02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.324
This is reckless, Jillian.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:14.090
All someone has to do is sneeze too hard

02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.527
and everyone in this building
is going to disintegrate.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.001
It's completely unstable.

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:20.684
Do we need this safety light?

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:24.924
Safety lights are for dudes.

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:28.487
I hate doing that.

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.284
Hey, y'all need to come check this out.
Come up to the roof.

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.891
Is that for us?

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.126
I guess some people
actually do know what we did.

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:49.964
Well, that's not terrible.

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:51.965
No, it's not.

02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:53.530
It's not terrible at all.

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:12.964
I call it the nutcracker.

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:14.970
'Cause it crushes the ghost.

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:16.371
No, it's for walnuts.

02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:20.526
Smart.

02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:27.882
What is it? Did you get something?

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:30.611
Yeah. I heard something really weird.

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:33.891
What's "Zuul"?

02:13:34.305 --> 02:13:40.855
