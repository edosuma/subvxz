01:22.400 --> 01:26.367
<i>Oh, Al, were you
watching Shane again?</i>

01:26.402 --> 01:28.734
Nah.

01:28.769 --> 01:30.601
Phone company commercial.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.200
It had this father
and his kid.

01:36.235 --> 01:38.701
They were walking down
this country road,

01:38.736 --> 01:40.601
or alley or something.

01:40.636 --> 01:42.767
And they were
kicking this rock

01:42.802 --> 01:44.968
or pine cone
or something,

01:45.003 --> 01:48.767
and then the father was old,
and the kid was grown-up and...

01:49.901 --> 01:51.767
He called him. Oh, man.

01:54.801 --> 01:57.934
You know, Peg, I wish Bud lived
far away, so I could call him.

02:00.467 --> 02:02.701
How many beers did you
have tonight, Al?

02:02.736 --> 02:04.334
I don't know.

02:04.369 --> 02:06.267
Kids grow up so fast.

02:06.302 --> 02:09.567
Sometimes I don't think
we spend enough time with ours.

02:09.602 --> 02:14.100
Have dinner with them,
touch them, kick things...

02:14.135 --> 02:16.300
I miss that.

02:16.335 --> 02:17.300
Bud!

02:17.335 --> 02:18.934
Bud, come down here.

02:20.801 --> 02:21.968
What did I do, Dad?

02:22.003 --> 02:23.801
Nothing...

02:23.836 --> 02:27.834
It's just that I don't get to
talk to you too much anymore.

02:27.869 --> 02:29.634
How's the fourth grade?

02:29.669 --> 02:32.968
Fifth grade, Dad.

02:33.003 --> 02:34.601
How about that, Peg?

02:34.636 --> 02:37.968
Bud, where are you
going tonight?

02:38.003 --> 02:40.667
I'm going down the block
to Joey's house and watch TV.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.200
That's fine.
Oh, uh, Bud?

02:42.235 --> 02:43.834
Yeah, Dad?

02:43.869 --> 02:46.100
If you're going to be late...

02:46.135 --> 02:47.367
call.

02:54.033 --> 02:57.000
That's a moment
he'll always remember.

02:57.035 --> 03:00.133
Hey, Al, let's go out tonight.
To a restaurant, or something.

03:00.168 --> 03:01.501
Aah!

03:01.536 --> 03:05.000
Come on. When we were dating,
we used to go out all the time.

03:05.035 --> 03:07.033
Eating costs a fortune, Peg.

03:07.068 --> 03:10.200
Besides, we have
other expenses right now.

03:10.235 --> 03:11.567
In a couple of years,

03:11.602 --> 03:14.300
our kids are probably going
to want to go to college.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.701
All right, where do you
want to go eat?

03:20.736 --> 03:21.734
Oh, good.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.033
That must be Steve and Marcie

03:24.068 --> 03:25.434
I told them we'd eat with them.

03:25.469 --> 03:27.167
You just lost yourself
a meal, Peg.

03:27.202 --> 03:29.033
Oh, Al.

03:29.068 --> 03:30.334
Hey, neighbors.

03:30.369 --> 03:32.501
Ready to put on
the old feed bag?

03:32.536 --> 03:33.901
What do you feel like tonight?

03:33.936 --> 03:36.067
Japanese, Thai...

03:36.102 --> 03:37.133
Moroccan?

03:37.168 --> 03:39.167
Oh, Al only eats plain food.

03:39.202 --> 03:41.467
You know,
like burgers and pizza.

03:41.502 --> 03:43.300
Come on, Al.
Live a little.

03:43.335 --> 03:44.601
You can't go through life

03:44.636 --> 03:46.133
ordering food
through a clown's head.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.200
Oh, yeah?

03:50.434 --> 03:51.934
Cook some food!

03:57.634 --> 03:59.267
Let's go out
to eat, honey.

03:59.302 --> 04:01.100
Aw, what the hell?
I ain't paying for it.

04:01.135 --> 04:02.868
That's my man.

04:04.502 --> 04:06.234
Got a date. Got to run.

04:06.269 --> 04:07.267
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

04:07.302 --> 04:09.033
Hold it a minute!

04:09.068 --> 04:11.133
Some guy honks his horn,
you come running?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.434
I want to meet him.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.200
You can't.

04:14.235 --> 04:15.634
Roger doesn't meet parents.

04:15.669 --> 04:17.067
It's his policy.

04:17.101 --> 04:19.067
Roger sounds like
a very nice boy,

04:19.101 --> 04:20.901
but I think
I'll meet him anyway.

04:20.935 --> 04:22.534
By the way,
what's his last name?

04:22.569 --> 04:24.734
I don't know.

04:24.769 --> 04:27.133
But don't make him drive off,
because I love him.

04:29.534 --> 04:31.133
Maybe I better go out there

04:31.168 --> 04:32.801
and make sure Al
doesn't do anything stupid.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.200
This is so embarrassing.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.300
I just know Dad's going
to misinterpret

04:38.335 --> 04:40.133
the dog collar
around Roger's neck.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.267
I can't believe they've been
out there for over an hour.

04:50.968 --> 04:52.367
What could they be doing?

04:52.402 --> 04:55.400
It is a long time for two people
with nothing in common

04:55.435 --> 04:56.501
to be spending together.

04:57.634 --> 04:59.167
But then again,

04:59.202 --> 05:01.968
Steve went out to make sure
Al doesn't do anything stupid.

05:02.003 --> 05:03.968
That could take a while.

05:06.534 --> 05:07.868
Can I go now, Dad?

05:07.903 --> 05:10.133
Sure, honey. Go ahead.

05:10.168 --> 05:12.367
Have a good time,
sweetheart.

05:12.402 --> 05:14.334
Sure. I'll have a great time.

05:14.369 --> 05:18.901
The big windows at school
are probably smashed by now.

05:18.936 --> 05:20.701
Al, we're starving.

05:20.736 --> 05:22.868
What were you two doing
out there for so long?

05:22.903 --> 05:26.200
Peg, we just outsmarted
a teenage boy.

05:26.235 --> 05:27.334
We sure did.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.234
Honey, you wouldn't
believe it,

05:29.269 --> 05:31.100
but underneath all that rust,

05:31.135 --> 05:34.367
that kid was actually driving
a '65 Mustang.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.167
That's what you were doing
for an hour?

05:36.202 --> 05:38.200
Looking at a 20-year-old
rusted pile of junk?

05:40.200 --> 05:41.968
No, of course not.

05:42.003 --> 05:42.934
We bought it.

05:45.534 --> 05:48.267
You made a major purchase
without consulting me?

05:48.302 --> 05:50.667
It's a car, honey.

05:50.702 --> 05:53.067
<i>For us hombres,
right, Al?</i>

05:53.102 --> 05:55.667
You betcha, Steverino.

05:57.067 --> 05:59.767
Tell me...Steverino.

05:59.802 --> 06:03.501
Did it ever occur to you
that we don't need another car?

06:03.536 --> 06:06.300
It's not just a car, honey.
It's a piece of history.

06:06.335 --> 06:09.467
A 289 with dual carbs
and a pony interior.

06:09.502 --> 06:12.334
Steve. Where did you learn
to talk like that?

06:14.300 --> 06:15.567
Hey, come on, honey.

06:15.602 --> 06:17.801
After all, I was a guy
before I met you.

06:22.634 --> 06:24.234
He was, honey.
Do you believe it?

06:26.234 --> 06:28.400
He had a Mustang
when he was in college.

06:28.435 --> 06:30.567
I always wanted one,
but I could never afford it.

06:30.602 --> 06:33.100
I hate to break this to you,
but we still can't.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.634
Sure, we can.

06:34.669 --> 06:39.133
The car we bought
is a total piece of junk.

06:39.168 --> 06:40.567
Yeah. Besides, we split it.

06:40.602 --> 06:43.367
We're going to restore it,
make it worth a lot of money...

06:43.402 --> 06:44.968
And never sell it.

06:45.003 --> 06:45.968
Come on, Steve.

06:46.003 --> 06:47.534
Let's get out in that garage

06:47.569 --> 06:49.234
and strip the rust
off this baby.

06:49.269 --> 06:51.033
Hey, what about taking us
to dinner?

06:51.068 --> 06:52.434
Yeah.

06:52.469 --> 06:54.667
Honey, we can't afford
to eat out now.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.968
We just bought a car.

07:01.868 --> 07:03.100
Good night, Mom.

07:03.135 --> 07:04.767
I thought you had a date.

07:04.802 --> 07:08.934
Roger said he sold his car
to a couple of idiots.

07:08.969 --> 07:10.534
Do you think
I'm going to be seen

07:10.569 --> 07:12.467
walking with a guy
who wears a dog collar?

07:18.501 --> 07:19.501
Ooh.

07:20.901 --> 07:22.234
I hate that car,

07:22.269 --> 07:24.267
and everything
it stands for.

07:24.302 --> 07:25.767
Well, you have to admit,

07:25.802 --> 07:27.534
the boys have been
getting along this week.

07:27.569 --> 07:29.267
Oh, who cares?

07:30.734 --> 07:33.534
That car is beginning
to take over our lives.

07:33.569 --> 07:35.701
This morning I brought it
to Steve's attention

07:35.736 --> 07:37.200
that his fingernails were dirty.

07:37.235 --> 07:38.534
Do you know what he said?

07:38.569 --> 07:39.901
He said, "It's not dirt.

07:39.936 --> 07:41.934
It's Mustang juice, baby."

07:46.834 --> 07:51.367
Well, Al is reawakening certain
ugly, manlike qualities

07:51.402 --> 07:54.734
in Steve, but this could work
to our advantage.

07:54.769 --> 07:58.334
You see, they bought something
that we hate without asking us,

07:58.369 --> 07:59.734
and that is bad,

07:59.769 --> 08:02.834
but now we have the right to
go out and buy whatever we want

08:02.869 --> 08:03.934
without asking them,

08:03.969 --> 08:05.067
and that is good.

08:07.601 --> 08:08.701
It's in the Bible.

08:10.634 --> 08:13.167
But we can't afford
to buy anything.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.434
Well...

08:14.469 --> 08:16.434
Then let's just be
mean as hell.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.167
Peg, Marcie,
we just wanted you to know

08:21.202 --> 08:23.400
we rebuilt one of the
carburetors in the Mustang.

08:25.033 --> 08:27.601
Yoo-hoo, road warriors.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.100
We're bored.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.734
And mean as hell.

08:32.769 --> 08:34.667
You want to come
out in the garage

08:34.702 --> 08:35.967
and use one of the sanders?

08:36.003 --> 08:37.067
Not on the car.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.767
You still owe us a dinner.

08:41.802 --> 08:42.933
That's right.

08:42.969 --> 08:43.933
We've been patient.

08:43.969 --> 08:45.968
We can't force you
to go to bed with us,

08:46.003 --> 08:49.534
but we insist you
take us out to eat.

08:49.569 --> 08:50.968
Okay.

08:51.003 --> 08:52.300
Steak place
okay with you, buddy?

08:52.335 --> 08:53.300
You got it.

08:53.335 --> 08:55.701
Steve, we're vegetarian.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.467
You don't eat meat.

08:57.502 --> 08:59.667
Honey, I'm working on a car.

09:01.133 --> 09:04.868
Honey, I'm working on a car.

09:04.903 --> 09:07.534
I'm sorry I neglected you
all week, Marcie.

09:07.569 --> 09:09.100
I don't know
what got into me.

09:09.135 --> 09:10.601
It was the car, Steve.

09:12.634 --> 09:14.834
But it has brought you
closer to Al,

09:14.869 --> 09:17.300
so at least we don't have
to suffer that uneasiness

09:17.335 --> 09:18.834
whenever we come over here.

09:18.869 --> 09:20.634
You can't be serious.

09:20.669 --> 09:21.968
I have to stay with Bud,

09:22.003 --> 09:23.300
so you can go out

09:23.335 --> 09:25.167
with those creepy, boring people
that live next door?

09:25.202 --> 09:26.234
Yes.

09:26.269 --> 09:28.367
I have to lose a night
of my glory days

09:28.402 --> 09:29.834
for a couple of complete orthos.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.868
Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades.

09:33.903 --> 09:35.934
It's nice to see you,
as always.

09:38.067 --> 09:42.701
Kelly, could you please
bring me a tissue?

09:42.736 --> 09:45.033
Get one yourself,
you little zit!

09:46.334 --> 09:47.567
Never mind.

09:47.602 --> 09:49.567
I found a whole bunch of them
in your bra.

09:52.934 --> 09:54.534
Excuse me.

09:59.634 --> 10:01.634
You're still on the
pill, aren't you?

10:05.601 --> 10:07.367
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:07.402 --> 10:10.634
We had to dig through the hamper
to find a shirt for Al.

10:13.934 --> 10:15.667
Peggy, did you make
the reservation?

10:15.702 --> 10:17.868
Oh, yes. And we're going
to get a great table.

10:17.903 --> 10:20.467
We made it under
the name of Dr. Bundy.

10:20.502 --> 10:23.701
By the way, Marcie, we told them
it was your birthday

10:23.736 --> 10:26.033
so we'd get a free cake.

10:26.068 --> 10:28.400
Just play along
when the waiter starts singing.

10:29.968 --> 10:31.267
Well, I could eat a horse.

10:32.402 --> 10:33.534
I won't be, will I?

10:33.569 --> 10:35.501
Kelly, we're leaving!

10:35.536 --> 10:37.734
The phone number's
on the refrigerator,

10:37.769 --> 10:39.667
and make sure Bud
is asleep by 10.

10:39.702 --> 10:41.133
He's already sleeping, mom.

10:42.335 --> 10:44.334
Aw, I love you too, Bud.

10:44.369 --> 10:45.667
We're ready to go.

10:45.702 --> 10:46.968
Great news!

10:47.003 --> 10:48.934
I got an original ashtray
for the car.

10:48.969 --> 10:50.200
An ashtray?
Yeah.

10:50.235 --> 10:52.100
We got to go now.
He's got another offer.

10:52.135 --> 10:53.133
Forget it.

10:53.168 --> 10:54.567
That's right.
We're going to dinner.

10:54.602 --> 10:56.634
The restaurant will hold
our reservations

10:56.669 --> 10:59.667
because, after all, it's your
birthday and I'm a doctor.

10:59.702 --> 11:02.267
Come on, girls,
we're going to the ghetto.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.400
It's beautiful.

11:12.435 --> 11:14.601
Look at it, Steve.
It's a virgin.

11:14.636 --> 11:17.667
There has never been
a cigarette in that ashtray.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.701
Are you irritated because
we left you in the car

11:28.736 --> 11:30.534
while we went upstairs
to haggle over the price?

11:30.569 --> 11:32.801
Oh, no.
I had a great time.

11:32.836 --> 11:36.200
I like sitting in a car that's
being rocked back and forth

11:36.235 --> 11:40.067
by grown men yelling "Hubba
Hubba, my name is Bubba!"

11:41.534 --> 11:43.634
But I think Marcie's
a little ticked.

11:46.267 --> 11:49.234
This is the worst birthday
I've ever had.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.934
I've never been so humiliated.

11:53.969 --> 11:57.868
What about me?
They offered me $20.

11:57.903 --> 12:01.601
They offered me 30.

12:01.636 --> 12:04.834
That was for both of us,
pretty mama.

12:04.869 --> 12:06.968
I got them to leave,
didn't I?

12:07.003 --> 12:08.501
Oh, yes, you did, honey.

12:08.536 --> 12:10.200
And you were so clever.

12:10.235 --> 12:13.133
I wish I had thought of throwing
my purse down the street.

12:15.701 --> 12:19.000
Nothing I do is ever
good enough for you, is it, Peg?

12:19.035 --> 12:21.734
Hey, I'm going to go
put the ashtray in the car.

12:21.769 --> 12:23.000
I'll help.

12:27.701 --> 12:29.400
I swear to God,

12:29.435 --> 12:31.601
as soon as Steve
goes to sleep tonight,

12:31.636 --> 12:35.133
I'm going to smash that car
into little bits.

12:35.168 --> 12:37.200
Except for the ashtray.

12:37.235 --> 12:39.434
I have special plans for that.

12:41.267 --> 12:44.601
Well, maybe we've been
too hard on the guys.

12:44.636 --> 12:46.234
Cars are in their blood.

12:46.269 --> 12:47.968
You see, with men,

12:48.003 --> 12:50.701
they hear the engine, and
they think it's their engine.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.467
They see the sleek
and smooth lines of the car,

12:53.502 --> 12:55.601
and they think
they're sleek and smooth.

12:55.636 --> 12:59.100
Then they reach for
that stick shift, and...

12:59.135 --> 12:59.968
Well...

13:01.667 --> 13:03.033
You know what I mean.

13:08.634 --> 13:11.968
I don't know, there's something
about a stick shift.

13:12.003 --> 13:14.634
Yeah. I don't know what it is.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.267
That's a nice one, isn't it?

13:16.302 --> 13:17.667
You got the ashtray ready?

13:17.702 --> 13:19.033
Yeah, right here.
Be my guest.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.234
Ahh.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.100
You know something?

13:28.135 --> 13:32.033
It doesn't get
any better than this.

13:32.068 --> 13:35.067
You know, Steve, you're not
my kind of guy or anything,

13:35.102 --> 13:37.968
and I don't want
to hang around with you,

13:38.003 --> 13:41.234
but you know your cars.

13:41.269 --> 13:42.701
Well, thanks, Al.

13:42.736 --> 13:45.234
Remember, I used to have
one of these babies.

13:45.269 --> 13:48.167
Oh, gee, I loved that car.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.934
Those were the days.

13:49.969 --> 13:51.868
Being alive really meant
something then.

13:51.903 --> 13:53.701
You used to buy a car
to have fun.

13:53.736 --> 13:56.200
Now you worry
about four doors, mileage,

13:56.235 --> 13:59.400
whether or not you'll survive
a head-on collision.

13:59.435 --> 14:01.601
I mean, who cares?

14:01.636 --> 14:03.834
Looking cool and going fast.

14:03.869 --> 14:05.734
That's what cars
should be for.

14:08.734 --> 14:10.734
Hey, Al?

14:10.769 --> 14:14.133
You think, uh,
we'll still look cool?

14:14.168 --> 14:16.400
What are we, old men?

14:20.267 --> 14:22.033
These things are classics.

14:22.068 --> 14:24.868
Everybody looks cool
in these things.

14:24.903 --> 14:27.133
Oh, wait till we get
this thing finished.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.667
* Get your motor runnin' *

14:44.702 --> 14:48.100
* Head out on the highway *

14:48.135 --> 14:51.434
* Lookin' for adventure *

14:51.469 --> 14:54.868
* And whatever comes our way *

14:54.903 --> 14:59.067
* Yeah, darlin'
Go make it happen *

14:59.102 --> 15:02.000
* Take the world
In a love embrace *

15:09.367 --> 15:11.701
Yeah, it's going
to be great, buddy.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.501
*...at once and *

15:13.536 --> 15:16.200
* Explode into space *

15:16.235 --> 15:18.701
* I like smoke and lightning *

15:18.736 --> 15:21.701
* Heavy metal thunder *

15:21.736 --> 15:25.167
* Racin' with the wind *

15:25.202 --> 15:28.100
* And the feelin'
That I'm under *

15:29.801 --> 15:33.334
* Yeah, I gotta go
And make it happen *

15:33.369 --> 15:36.434
* Take the world
In a love embrace *

15:36.469 --> 15:39.234
* Fire all of our guns
At once and *

15:39.269 --> 15:42.601
* Explode into space *

15:42.636 --> 15:45.567
* Like a true Nature's child *

15:45.602 --> 15:48.634
* We were born
Born to be wild *

15:48.669 --> 15:50.934
* We can climb so high *

15:50.969 --> 15:54.234
* I never wanna die *

15:56.200 --> 15:59.567
* Born to be wild *

16:03.033 --> 16:06.501
* Born to be wild **

16:17.601 --> 16:20.534
There's nothing like
a nice healthy salad.

16:20.569 --> 16:21.801
Yeah.

16:21.836 --> 16:24.133
It's much better than going
to some restaurant

16:24.168 --> 16:26.067
where you can
sit back and relax

16:26.102 --> 16:28.334
while some peon
serves your every need.

16:29.601 --> 16:30.868
No beverage?

16:32.501 --> 16:33.667
Sorry.

16:37.767 --> 16:39.767
I never thought
I could have this much hate

16:39.802 --> 16:41.267
for an inanimate object.

16:41.302 --> 16:43.267
You mean Al?

16:43.302 --> 16:44.467
Yeah.

16:44.502 --> 16:45.767
And that car.

16:45.802 --> 16:47.400
Well, you know, Marce,

16:47.435 --> 16:50.601
the love of a nice automobile
is not just a guy thing.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.801
You can't say tell me
you never dated a guy

16:52.836 --> 16:53.834
because of his car.

16:53.869 --> 16:56.400
Never.
Come on.

16:56.435 --> 16:57.701
Well...

16:57.736 --> 16:59.501
Don't tell Steve,

16:59.536 --> 17:01.667
but there was this guy
in high school.

17:01.702 --> 17:03.100
He had a GTO.

17:03.135 --> 17:05.267
A black one.
Mmm.

17:05.301 --> 17:07.767
But I finally had
to break up with him, because-

17:07.801 --> 17:10.400
This is so disgusting-

17:10.435 --> 17:13.067
He wanted to, you know...

17:13.102 --> 17:15.032
get me in the back seat
of the car.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.467
So did you?

17:18.502 --> 17:19.867
Of course not.

17:19.903 --> 17:22.434
It's so dirty and tawdry.

17:22.469 --> 17:23.867
No, it isn't.

17:26.434 --> 17:27.567
You did that?

17:27.602 --> 17:29.267
Well, sure.

17:29.302 --> 17:32.634
It gets expensive chipping in
for a hotel every few days.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.000
I just never could.

17:37.035 --> 17:40.133
Steve wanted to,
but I'm glad we didn't.

17:40.168 --> 17:42.067
It's still our family car.

17:42.102 --> 17:45.167
We put groceries back there.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.033
Well, good news, girls.
We got the ashtray in.

17:51.068 --> 17:52.267
Where's Steve?

17:52.302 --> 17:54.868
He's still out there
playing with the top.

17:54.903 --> 17:56.801
You know, he gets carried away.

17:56.836 --> 17:58.000
I'm going to go get him.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.367
It's late,

17:59.402 --> 18:01.133
and we have to pick out
his clothes for tomorrow.

18:05.235 --> 18:06.534
Hello?

18:06.569 --> 18:08.334
Albany?

18:08.369 --> 18:10.133
Collect?
Hell, no, I'm not-

18:10.168 --> 18:12.234
We'll pay for the charges!

18:12.269 --> 18:13.234
Hello?

18:13.269 --> 18:15.534
Dr. Mustang?

18:15.569 --> 18:16.701
You got the ornament?!

18:16.736 --> 18:17.968
He got the little horse.

18:18.003 --> 18:19.534
Yee-ha.

18:19.569 --> 18:22.133
Yeah. You got
yourself a deal.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.801
I'll send the check
in the morning.

18:24.836 --> 18:26.801
Best to Mrs. Mustang.

18:26.836 --> 18:28.501
Wow! The little horse!

18:28.536 --> 18:29.934
We got to go tell Steve.

18:29.969 --> 18:31.734
Don't you two
want to be alone for this?

18:33.601 --> 18:34.734
Nah.

18:48.434 --> 18:51.000
Aw, isn't that sweet?

18:51.035 --> 18:53.934
It's their first time in a car.
Come on, honey.

18:53.969 --> 18:55.567
Okay.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.100
Wait a minute, Peg.

18:58.135 --> 18:59.467
Hey, Steve!

18:59.502 --> 19:01.367
We got the horse!

19:01.402 --> 19:02.634
All right!

19:08.067 --> 19:10.901
Well, it's almost time
for the unveiling.

19:10.936 --> 19:13.067
To tell you the truth,
I'm kind of curious.

19:13.102 --> 19:15.234
I haven't seen it
since they painted it.

19:16.602 --> 19:18.534
Aren't you getting excited?

19:18.569 --> 19:19.968
What's that supposed to mean?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.534
Come on, Marce.
It's been three weeks.

19:24.569 --> 19:25.934
You can look me in the eye.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.167
I can't help it.

19:29.202 --> 19:32.834
I'm still so embarrassed,
especially around Al.

19:32.869 --> 19:34.167
He doesn't say anything,

19:34.202 --> 19:35.968
but I know every time
he looks at me,

19:36.003 --> 19:38.634
he's thinking about
how he caught us in that car.

19:38.669 --> 19:41.534
Believe me, I've known him
a long time,

19:41.569 --> 19:44.701
and when Al's not talking,
he is not thinking.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.901
Girls, time for the unveiling.

19:49.936 --> 19:51.133
Big deal.

19:51.168 --> 19:52.834
Well, it will be
for you, Marce.

19:52.869 --> 19:55.100
This is your big chance
to see the outside of the car.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.601
Let's go.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.834
Gee. It's beautiful.

20:08.869 --> 20:10.133
Shut up, Peg.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.067
This is a big moment,

20:12.102 --> 20:13.667
and I want to make sure
it's right.

20:13.702 --> 20:15.133
Okay! Ready!

20:20.434 --> 20:24.000
Oh, Al, it really
is beautiful.

20:24.035 --> 20:25.667
Yeah, we know.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.834
Come on. Let's take
this baby for a spin.

20:27.869 --> 20:29.133
Girls, get in the back seat.

20:29.168 --> 20:31.167
Peg, Marcie can
show you the way.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.167
Steve, I'll drive.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.000
We'll take a nice spin
out in the country.

20:38.035 --> 20:40.501
You sit and lean coolly
out the window.

20:40.536 --> 20:42.234
We'll pretend
these are our mothers.

20:49.901 --> 20:52.133
* Born to be- *
* Born to be- *

21:03.035 --> 21:05.367
* Wild **
* Wild **

21:12.334 --> 21:14.434
I'm sorry about the car, honey.

21:14.469 --> 21:16.601
You couldn't have known
it was stolen.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.501
I think Al might have gone
a little overboard

21:20.536 --> 21:22.100
starting the fight
with that policeman.

21:22.135 --> 21:24.033
Now, Al just had it
in his head

21:24.068 --> 21:27.200
that the cop might
have been an impersonator.

21:27.235 --> 21:30.767
Sorry I put that
in your head, Al.

21:30.802 --> 21:32.334
By the way, Al?

21:32.369 --> 21:35.167
They say the effects
of the stun gun

21:35.202 --> 21:36.934
will wear off
in a few hours.

21:38.868 --> 21:41.300
Yeah, you know, you were
really holding your own

21:41.335 --> 21:43.601
until that angry mob showed up.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.400
I wonder where those farmers
got their stun guns.

21:47.968 --> 21:50.334
Well, there goes
our dream, old buddy.

21:52.133 --> 21:54.234
Al?

21:54.269 --> 21:56.567
They impounded the car.

21:56.602 --> 22:00.100
We'll never see it again,
except at the trial.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.300
Well, at least one good thing
came out of this.

22:04.335 --> 22:06.501
We found out we could all have
a good time together,

22:06.536 --> 22:08.634
and that's more important
than any car.

22:08.669 --> 22:09.634
Hear, hear.

22:09.669 --> 22:11.167
It's still early.

22:11.202 --> 22:13.200
Why don't we go out
and get some dinner,

22:13.235 --> 22:15.200
kick back,
and lick our wounds?

22:15.235 --> 22:17.234
Yeah. Let's go eat.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.834
How about Japanese?

22:18.869 --> 22:21.100
Thai? Moroccan?

22:21.135 --> 22:22.834
Whatever.
Al won't know the difference.

22:35.601 --> 22:39.100
