00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.000 --> 01:00.500


01:45.125 --> 01:47.291
-Ow! My back!

01:49.375 --> 01:52.250
Oh, my babies!

01:52.333 --> 01:57.000
I fed them.
I nursed them. I kept them alive.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.708
Without me, they're doomed.

02:00.791 --> 02:04.583
Don't worry, Elder Kettle.
We'll take care of your babies.

02:04.666 --> 02:08.041
-Here. Let me fluff your pillow.
-Can I get you some soup?

02:08.791 --> 02:11.291
You two are being awfully helpful.

02:11.791 --> 02:15.000
You're up to something.
I've got my eye on--

02:18.125 --> 02:21.541
Out like a light.
Let's scram and catch that picture show.

02:25.541 --> 02:28.125
We gotta make tracks
if we're gonna make the five o'clock!

02:28.208 --> 02:31.833
Kettle's garden.
We promised we'd take care of his babies.

02:31.916 --> 02:33.541
Feed 'em. Nurture them.

02:33.625 --> 02:37.208
Kinda like how he took care of us
when we were babies.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.666
Why'd you have to go and say it like that?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.166
Blurgh.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.750
Nothing interesting
ever happens around here.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.708


02:55.166 --> 02:57.000
You can say that again.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.791
-Hey!

03:10.916 --> 03:12.625
All right, get out here!

03:14.875 --> 03:16.875
Okay, what gives?

03:16.958 --> 03:20.625
We're real sorry, mister.
We don't mean to bother youse.

03:20.750 --> 03:24.708
We's just some, uh,
down-on-our-luck vegetables.

03:24.791 --> 03:28.333
I'm Sal. This is Ollie.
And that's Chauncey.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.500
Yeah.
We don't got nowheres to call home.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.458
We're, uh, orphans.

03:33.541 --> 03:35.833
Yeah, that's it. Orphans.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.000
Wait! We're orphans?!

03:38.583 --> 03:40.125
That's so sad!

03:40.208 --> 03:42.958
Hey! Ease up on the waterworks, will you?

03:43.041 --> 03:46.083
The last thing we need
is you peeling all over the place.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.125
Then we'll all start crying!

03:48.208 --> 03:52.250
I'm sorry, Sal! It's just--
You know, it's such a sad story!

03:52.333 --> 03:55.750
Don't mind him. He gets, uh, emotional.

03:55.833 --> 03:59.166
Listen, all we're asking for
is a little bit of soil

03:59.250 --> 04:01.166
to rest our weary roots.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.791
Just for one night.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.250
What do you say, eh?

04:04.833 --> 04:05.791
We'd love to help,

04:05.875 --> 04:09.125
but we gotta keep an eye on Elder Kettle's
boring, old vegetable garden.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.208
Elder Kettle takes his garden
very seriously.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.458
They're his babies.

04:14.541 --> 04:16.333
If anything happened to 'em…

04:16.416 --> 04:18.125
He'd be heartbroken.

04:19.125 --> 04:23.166
Well, heck. No one takes better care
of veggies than veggies.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.208
Yeah. We can help you.

04:25.291 --> 04:26.833
-You could?
-You would?

04:26.916 --> 04:29.458
Sure. Just let us handle that garden

04:29.541 --> 04:32.750
while the two of youse
go have a fun night on the town.

04:32.833 --> 04:35.625
-Well, if you insist.
-Gee, thanks.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.375
Swell. This is gonna be a great night.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.708
Swell.
This is gonna be a great night.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.458
-That was dynamite!
-Especially the explosions.

04:48.541 --> 04:49.750
-Wow.

04:49.833 --> 04:52.125
Sounds like someone's throwing
a heck of a shindig.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.166
Oh, a party. We should crash it.

04:55.708 --> 04:56.541
Mugsy?

04:57.916 --> 04:59.250


05:14.041 --> 05:15.541
Well, check it again!

05:15.625 --> 05:18.000
Mugman and Cuphead!

05:18.083 --> 05:20.791
I'm telling you. You ain't on the list.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.291
But we live here!

05:22.375 --> 05:27.208
All right, enough! Hey, tough stuff,
don't look now, but your hat's on crooked.

05:27.791 --> 05:28.708
It is?

05:31.416 --> 05:33.791
Hey, I ain't wearing a hat.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.250
And I just say, "What money?"

05:37.250 --> 05:39.958
Hey, you! This ain't what we agreed to!

05:40.041 --> 05:41.458
Ah, lighten up.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.291
Let me introduce you
to some friends of mine.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.500
The Heirloom sisters.

05:46.583 --> 05:51.625
I'm Cherry, and this is Brandywine.
We're a couple of hot tomatoes.

05:51.708 --> 05:56.458
Swell party. We was just about
to bust the piñata. Wanna help?

05:56.541 --> 05:57.625
No!

05:57.708 --> 06:00.375
Wait. Did you say piñata? I love piñatas!

06:03.708 --> 06:06.416
Cuphead! We're not supposed
to be enjoying this.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.166
We're upset, remember?

06:09.250 --> 06:10.333
Oh, right.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.125
Uh, excuse me.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.541
Quiet!

06:16.083 --> 06:18.083
Everybody, listen up!

06:23.708 --> 06:26.333
Yeah, you heard my brother! Beat it!

06:30.416 --> 06:31.250
Hit it!

06:35.666 --> 06:38.875
-Hey, I'm parched. Wanna get a drink?
-Heck yeah!

06:43.125 --> 06:47.458
-They're killing Elder Kettle's babies!
-We gotta bust this party up now!

06:47.541 --> 06:48.833
Mm-hm.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.708
Ow! Ouch!

07:03.375 --> 07:05.083
Operator, get me the police.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.083
You ain't on the list.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.291
Sorry, boys. We gave it a shot.

07:19.375 --> 07:20.875
Nice try, losers.

07:20.958 --> 07:23.666
This party ain't over
till the sun comes up.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.416
"Till the sun comes up," eh?

07:38.041 --> 07:40.500
Uh, cock-a-doodle-doo?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.541
Well, I guess that's it.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.708
Kettle's garden is as good as dead.

07:50.791 --> 07:52.333
And so are we.

07:52.416 --> 07:53.250
Dead?

07:53.333 --> 07:56.250
Gee, that sure is sad.

07:56.916 --> 07:57.958
Hmm…

07:58.041 --> 08:02.958
Yep. This garden
is all our poor Elder Kettle has left.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.958
Almost makes you wanna cry.

08:05.041 --> 08:09.333
That's just terrible!
Poor Elder Kettle.

08:09.416 --> 08:12.708
Without his garden,
he's got nothing to live for.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.791
-Not that he has much time left.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.916
You know,
with him being so elderly and all.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.500
-And did we mention that he's an orphan?

08:22.583 --> 08:23.958
An orphan?

08:30.500 --> 08:33.750
Ha! This guy. I love this guy.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.500
Urgh! But I don't love this.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.958
Let's get outta here.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.708
Cherry, Brandywine, wait!

08:45.791 --> 08:47.291
Fat chance, buster!

08:47.375 --> 08:50.833
Yeah. This turned out
to be a real pity party.

08:50.916 --> 08:53.291
-Hmph!
-No! Come back!

09:13.750 --> 09:16.958
Their tears watered Elder Kettle's babies!

09:17.041 --> 09:18.958
The day is saved!

09:19.041 --> 09:20.041
Hooray!

09:21.208 --> 09:24.500
You just had to start blubbering,
didn't you?

09:26.875 --> 09:28.666
All right. Party's over.

09:28.750 --> 09:32.166
Yeah! Get out of here,
you, uh, freeloaders!

09:32.250 --> 09:33.458
You know something?

09:33.541 --> 09:37.166
I'm starting to get the feeling
we ain't wanted.

09:37.250 --> 09:41.375
Well, then,
maybe one last sip for the road.

09:55.583 --> 09:56.833
No!

10:08.583 --> 10:11.000
Maybe Elder Kettle won't notice?

10:14.375 --> 10:17.291
Yeah! My babies!

10:17.375 --> 10:19.916
You grew up to be so big!

10:21.250 --> 10:24.750
Hear that, boys?
This old jasper thinks we're his babies.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.625
Looks like
we ain't orphans no more.

10:28.708 --> 10:31.708
-It's a happy ending.

10:31.791 --> 10:36.958
Now it's time
to make Elder Kettle's famous baby stew!
