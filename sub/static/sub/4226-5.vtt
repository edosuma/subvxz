00:18.385 --> 00:21.220
Thought you were gonna leave me in
the dust back there on that turn.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.222
I paid attention when Pope
taught me how to ride.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.990
Figured I'd have to
outrun him some day.

00:24.991 --> 00:26.492
What do you got?

00:26.493 --> 00:28.694
Well, we're clear on the 111
all the way to the turnpike.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.130
And there's a, uh, a water tower
at the corner of Hosmer

00:31.131 --> 00:32.398
we haven't tapped yet.
- Okay.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.966
- All right?
- All right.

00:33.967 --> 00:37.300
[grunts]

00:37.370 --> 00:40.105
So, are you
ever gonna tell me

00:40.106 --> 00:42.007
how you knew where
all these drugs were?

00:42.008 --> 00:43.575
What were you,
a junior in high school?

00:43.576 --> 00:45.277
Senior.

00:45.278 --> 00:48.047
And you didn't know where
the local dealer kept his stash?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.149
What'd you do
in your free time?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.650
I played lacrosse.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.052
That explains a lot.

00:59.492 --> 01:00.993
Yeah, we --

01:00.994 --> 01:03.429
Percocet
and, uh, Demerol...

01:03.430 --> 01:05.930
Oxycontin.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.333
And heroin.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.001
I don't think I've ever
even seen heroin before.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.970
Looks a lot
like cocaine.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.038
You learn the difference when you
watch a lot of late-night cop shows,

01:13.039 --> 01:15.441
which is what I used to do
when I couldn't sleep.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.609
I once had a student
give a thesis

01:17.610 --> 01:20.446
on the history of
the American police drama.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.748
I graded him down 'cause
he didn't mention "Miami Vice."

01:22.749 --> 01:25.117
ANNE: Really?
TOM: This is amazing.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.252
Thank you.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.654
Thank you, Margaret!

01:28.655 --> 01:30.556
MARGARET:
Yeah.

01:30.557 --> 01:33.158
We need to work these
into a usable form.

01:33.159 --> 01:38.062
Is this all gonna be ready
by tomorrow night?

01:38.131 --> 01:42.201
Look, Tom, harness removal
is not my area of expertise.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.769
You should talk to Harris.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.271
He's the one that figured out
this operation.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.441
I just want you to understand
how risky this is.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.377
It worked on Rick.

01:51.378 --> 01:55.838
It seems to,
but we're not sure yet.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.750
I just...

01:57.751 --> 02:00.819
if something
was to happen to Ben...

02:00.820 --> 02:03.722
You want me to know
that Ben could die.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.248
Okay. I know.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.560
Look, you're worried,
I'm worried.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.329
Everybody's got to
do their best.

02:10.330 --> 02:16.291
I realize
you can't perform miracles.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.470
You know, the other day,
I put a picture of him

02:18.471 --> 02:21.702
up on that bulletin board.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.509
All those kids
are missing...

02:23.510 --> 02:25.778
but Ben --

02:25.779 --> 02:29.613
I know right where he is.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.316
I'm gonna go get him.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.567
And then we'll take it
from there.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.642
We just got the report
from the recon team.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.311
The other group of harnessed
kids didn't come back last night.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.180
Ben's group
is still there,

03:01.181 --> 03:02.514
but we don't know
for how long.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.916
Drugs are ready.
We want to move.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.617
Show me what you got.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.519
Okay. There's a Mech here.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.789
We rip out this window,
eight go in.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.258
We assume that the noise wakes
up the Skitters and draws the Mech.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.561
The Mech comes around.
It gets blown up right here.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.564
Inside, we've got two men on
this door facing the hallway --

03:18.565 --> 03:20.332
continuous fire
once the Skitters show up.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.934
That leaves six men in the room
to kill the Skitters.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.569
Hard to time that.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.471
Grab the kids, get them
back out that window,

03:25.472 --> 03:28.771
and we disappear
into the woods.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.576
Tom, in battle,

03:30.577 --> 03:32.578
the more important
the objective,

03:32.579 --> 03:35.247
the easier it is to overlook
flaws in the plan.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.516
Now, if the Skitters
break through into the room

03:37.517 --> 03:42.257
or circle around outside
to intercept you, you fail.

03:42.322 --> 03:45.290
- I can accept that risk.
- It's not just your risk.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.658
It's the team's risk,
and it's Ben's risk.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.393
What happens to him
if the two of you

03:48.394 --> 03:49.728
get yourselves killed?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.597
Now, with your plan,
the first thing that you do

03:51.598 --> 03:52.898
is you wake the Skitters up.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.733
There goes
your tactical advantage.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.971
You want to keep them asleep
as long as possible.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.806
Hmm.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.841
What if, um...

04:02.842 --> 04:05.444
what if we keep them asleep
the whole time?

04:05.445 --> 04:08.514
'Cause, like, there's just that
one Mech there during the day.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.482
So we send the recon team in.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.317
They break the lock
on the back door.

04:12.318 --> 04:16.288
Then tonight they come in,
and just one guy goes in alone.

04:16.289 --> 04:18.891
You know, he goes in,
goes to Ben's room,

04:18.892 --> 04:22.252
kills the Skitter
while it's asleep.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.498
Well, they're not that easy
to kill, Hal.

04:26.499 --> 04:30.367
Well, you did it. Almost.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.739
WEAVER:
Getting in and out quietly is your best bet.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.507
Probably your only bet.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.008
Figure it out.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.216
[growls softly]

04:47.554 --> 04:49.655
How much water are you gonna
give that damn thing?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.990
Enough to keep it hydrated.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.725
It's not like
it would be hydrating you

04:53.726 --> 04:55.527
if you were its prisoner.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.463
I don't remember Rick being
dehydrated when we got him.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.265
Ah, that's true.

05:00.266 --> 05:03.602
But he did have 12 metallic
spikes bored into his spine

05:03.603 --> 05:05.537
and brain function
at the level

05:05.538 --> 05:07.673
of a moderately
sophisticated tomato.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.007
[snarls]

05:09.008 --> 05:11.510
[bell ringing]
Ooh. Lunchtime.

05:11.511 --> 05:15.277
Why don't you get it
a nosh?

05:15.348 --> 05:17.683
I just don't think we should
be keeping a Skitter here.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.619
MARGARET:
Yeah, it's better in a cage than
out scooping up kids.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.387
Better off dead
if you ask me.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.790
Don't get your blood pressure
up. It's not good for the baby.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.892
What's not good for my baby
is sharing my home

05:26.893 --> 05:28.694
with a killer alien
from outer space.

05:28.695 --> 05:32.495
[chuckles]

05:32.565 --> 05:34.066
Thanks.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.634
Haven't laughed
in a while.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.035
Yeah, well,
I wasn't joking.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.698
It's still funny.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.406
Hey.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.741
I'm Margaret.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.309
Sarah.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.677
# Many rivers to cross #

05:45.678 --> 05:47.446
TOM:
That's an interesting choice.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.314
It's a limited selection
but eclectic.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.916
Tell me you got
something for me.

05:50.917 --> 05:54.486
Okay, well, Skitters communicate
using radio waves --

05:54.487 --> 05:56.054
that much is clear.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.690
If they're transmitting,
I can usually pick it up

05:58.691 --> 06:00.559
on the radio
if they're nearby.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.060
But a single Skitter

06:02.061 --> 06:03.862
walking down a hallway
probably isn't transmitting.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.731
They're just off in their
little Skitter head.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.599
That's too bad.
I was hoping we could use it

06:07.600 --> 06:09.334
Iike an early-warning
detection system.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.969
I know. There's got to be
some use for it.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.805
You see, these components
are from the 1940s,

06:13.806 --> 06:15.907
and, I mean,
what you're talking about,

06:15.908 --> 06:18.010
we're just not there yet.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.578
Well,
if there are sentries,

06:19.579 --> 06:21.546
maybe you should wait
and get Ben later.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.548
No. No, no, no.
We can't wait any longer.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.417
Got to trust
your instincts, Tom.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.019
A lot more reliable
than technology.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.350
Oh, well,
keep your best man on it.

06:33.693 --> 06:39.359
# Well, I guess
I'll have to cry #

06:39.432 --> 06:42.595
# Many rivers to cross #

06:42.669 --> 06:44.870
# rivers to cross #

06:44.871 --> 06:48.568
# But just where to begin? #

06:48.641 --> 06:52.771
# I'm playing for time #

06:52.845 --> 06:58.477
# There have been times
I find myself #

06:58.551 --> 07:01.816
# Thinking of committing... #

07:01.888 --> 07:06.058
SCOTT:
Ooh, Captain Weaver.
What can I do for you?

07:06.059 --> 07:09.153
# Yes, I've got ma-- #

07:09.429 --> 07:11.396
Are you saying
we can't play music?

07:11.397 --> 07:13.632
You can play
whatever you want.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.133
Just not this.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.477
You guys belong
at medieval times.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.945
We're going to get Ben.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.847
Got to kill a Skitter
without making any noise.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.482
These things only give you
one shot.

07:30.483 --> 07:34.044
Let's keep at it.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.088
You got any pointers?

07:36.089 --> 07:37.856
Mm-hmm.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.792
MARGARET:
All right.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.194
You feel that?

07:42.195 --> 07:43.762
Mm-hmm.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.731
Okay.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.165
There.

07:47.166 --> 07:50.001
And it's a slow, steady pull
on the trigger,

07:50.002 --> 07:53.802
and the kick comes
from the front.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.607
Here's another idea --

07:59.679 --> 08:03.012
make sure you're close.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.016
Ben's at the hospital,
right?

08:05.017 --> 08:07.185
Franklin Pierce Memorial
off Route 2?

08:07.186 --> 08:08.687
Yeah.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.222
Yeah, I know that place.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.157
My aunt was there
for a long time,

08:12.158 --> 08:13.625
so I used to visit her.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.527
Are you going
through the rear door?

08:15.528 --> 08:17.028
Through
the ambulance bay.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.131
No, you want to go through
the ER and then turn left.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.799
It'll take you
to the main corridor.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.970
TOM:
Can you show me on this map?

08:26.672 --> 08:29.197
[indistinct conversations]

08:37.784 --> 08:39.518
[children laughing]

08:39.519 --> 08:42.019
Whoop.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.790
You better hurry.
Soup's going fast.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.191
Yeah, not fast enough.

08:46.192 --> 08:50.561
I, uh, wanted to talk
to you, sweetheart.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.690
Uh-oh.
It's a "sweetheart" talk?

08:53.766 --> 08:56.134
[screeches]

08:56.135 --> 08:57.869
[cage rattles]

08:57.870 --> 09:02.500

09:02.575 --> 09:05.075
That's a new sound.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.549
[hisses]

09:15.688 --> 09:20.284
Change your mind?
Ready for Dr. Glass' chat?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.060
Rapid blinking.

09:31.604 --> 09:35.768
[growls]

09:35.842 --> 09:37.175
[screeches]

09:37.176 --> 09:39.211
You remember that time
in Lake Huntington

09:39.212 --> 09:41.313
when Sam was in the boat,
I caught the fish,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.849
but as soon as I pulled
the hook out of its mouth,

09:43.850 --> 09:48.270
i- it swam away, and --
- Uncle Scott, just stop.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.590
Kate and l
spent a long time

09:51.591 --> 09:53.825
Iooking at that bulletin board
the other day.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.695
And tomorrow we are going to
put up something for Sam --

09:56.696 --> 09:59.698
I'm thinking maybe something
from that weekend.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.634
Maybe draw that fish.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.422
We want you
to come with us.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.940
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.643
Fine.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.144
No, I understand.

10:16.716 --> 10:21.016
You can't go on
like this forever.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.621
I can.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.122
[Skitter screeches]

[Skitter snarling]

10:29.328 --> 10:32.991
Aah! Aah!

10:33.065 --> 10:36.330
Get a guard!
We need to shoot it!

10:36.602 --> 10:39.102
Aah!

Get a runner out to Porter.
He won't be happy.

11:22.281 --> 11:26.149
We need to form
a burial detail.

11:26.218 --> 11:28.887
And we need to kill it --
now.

11:28.888 --> 11:32.023
AN N E:
Porter wouldn't want that.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.259
Dr. Glass...

11:34.260 --> 11:36.361
when the civilians
find out about this,

11:36.362 --> 11:39.331
they are going to panic,
and I cannot blame them.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.300
We never should have had this
thing here in the first place!

11:42.301 --> 11:45.437
We have it here for a reason,
and that reason is still valid.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.339
Studying them
is our best chance

11:47.340 --> 11:49.274
at figuring out
how to stop them.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.733
And I was making progress.

11:52.812 --> 11:55.113
[scoffs]

11:55.114 --> 11:58.249
I'll tell you what --
I will give you 24 hours

11:58.250 --> 12:01.252
to learn whatever there is left
to learn from that thing,

12:01.253 --> 12:05.781
and then I am coming
to kill it myself.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.996
[Skitter growls softly]

12:17.069 --> 12:19.569
[indistinct conversations]

12:31.751 --> 12:34.251
How you feeling?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.490
You're Hal.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.154
Yeah.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.129
You're not gonna eat that?

12:44.130 --> 12:45.730
I'm not hungry.

12:45.731 --> 12:48.433
That's a little uncommon
around here.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.001
[chuckles]

12:50.002 --> 12:52.370
So, uh...

12:52.371 --> 12:57.035
what's it like --
being with them?

12:57.109 --> 12:59.377
[dish thuds]

12:59.378 --> 13:03.781
Are you, like, with them
all the time?

13:03.849 --> 13:05.383
We stayed together.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.052
All right.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.320
What if you had to
take a piss or something

13:09.321 --> 13:13.417
in the middle
of the night?

13:13.492 --> 13:15.894
You went.

13:15.895 --> 13:20.355
Okay.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.434
What about those harnesses?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.960
You know,
they ever, um...

13:25.037 --> 13:27.767
Iike, break or anything?

13:31.377 --> 13:33.044
You know, I mean, like...

13:33.045 --> 13:35.080
is that how they knew
that you were one of them?

13:35.081 --> 13:36.347
Is it because
of the harness?

13:36.348 --> 13:40.284
They're not like that.

13:40.352 --> 13:43.221
You know, my brother
is in that hospital.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.556
That's where
you were, right?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.424
Now, do they have
any sentries in the hall--

13:46.425 --> 13:49.327
You're going to try and get him,
aren't you?

13:49.328 --> 13:54.197
Yeah.

13:54.266 --> 13:56.766
They'll kill you all.

14:02.775 --> 14:06.215
Margaret, hey.
I wanted to ask you --

14:06.345 --> 14:08.980
we're having a baby shower
for Sarah tomorrow night, and --

14:08.981 --> 14:10.882
Did you get in a fight
or something?

14:10.883 --> 14:13.952
Oh, no, I had to
clean out and re-stitch

14:13.953 --> 14:15.687
an infected wound
this morning.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.589
You a doctor?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.691
I was in med school.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.160
But I'm inviting you
to the baby shower tonight.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.429
For Sarah. Yeah.
I just met her. I'll pass.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.799
I think Sarah would
really like it if you came.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.368
I'm a little busy with
this whole war thing, but --

14:30.369 --> 14:33.896
you're leaking.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.975
You know, it wasn't easy for me
at first, either --

14:36.976 --> 14:38.943
settling into
a new community.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.646
A community, huh?
That's a pretty fancy name

14:41.647 --> 14:44.382
for a bunch of old people
and teachers with guns.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.017
I know that your last place
wasn't one.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.585
How did you end up

14:47.586 --> 14:48.820
with those creeps?

14:48.821 --> 14:52.101
You don't want to know,
sweetheart.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.342
I'm sorry
about Harris.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.481
He didn't deserve to die.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.076
[sighs]
Nobody did.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.419
You'll be fine without him.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.087
I hope so, Tom.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.157
Well, hope's got nothing
to do with it.

15:26.158 --> 15:29.460
You were the one I always
wanted to operate on Ben.

15:29.461 --> 15:32.123
Harris was a great surgeon.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.432
You care.

15:34.433 --> 15:38.130
Surgeons would not
consider that a plus.

15:38.404 --> 15:43.569
Patients do.

15:43.642 --> 15:47.635
Your son's not up there,
is he?

15:47.713 --> 15:49.747
No.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.683
Well, maybe...

15:51.684 --> 15:53.852
I mean, I realize
it's not the same --

15:53.853 --> 15:55.453
Ben's still with us --

15:55.454 --> 16:00.949
but maybe you should
put something up there.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.526
Why?

16:03.529 --> 16:04.996
It's just...

16:04.997 --> 16:07.465
how we are.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.966
[sighs]

16:13.639 --> 16:17.200
[footsteps depart]

16:17.476 --> 16:19.944
HAL:
Between it being nighttime
and them being asleep,

16:19.945 --> 16:22.814
I may be able to go right in.
- What's going on?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.016
Hal's come up
with an alternative plan.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.885
Really?

16:26.886 --> 16:28.486
I'm going in --

16:28.487 --> 16:30.188
with Rick's harness
strapped to my back.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.956
I'm gonna pretend
to be one of them.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.992
Absolutely not.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.627
It's original.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.095
It's crazy.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.730
I don't know
what's crazy anymore.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.665
We're fighting aliens
from outer space.

16:40.666 --> 16:45.865
We got an army
half-full of kids.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.706
Give us a minute.
- Look, Dad, I talked to Rick.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.608
He says the kids wander
around in there by themselves.

16:50.609 --> 16:51.809
You're saying
that they can't tell

16:51.810 --> 16:53.745
whether the harness
is connected or not?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.880
HAL:
I don't think so, not unless they're
trying to communicate with you.

16:55.881 --> 16:58.783
TOM:
This is good. This is great. But you're --

16:58.784 --> 17:00.551
Look, don't!
Dad! Listen to me!

17:00.552 --> 17:01.819
If we had more time,

17:01.820 --> 17:03.588
maybe we could come up
with the perfect plan.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.789
But we have to
get Ben now.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.223
Yes --
when you're young,

17:06.224 --> 17:07.892
you feel like you're invincible...
- Oh, my god.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.428
...and you don't always
use the best --

17:10.429 --> 17:12.931
Y- You gonna give me a lecture
on drunk driving right now?

17:12.932 --> 17:14.565
You don't understand
how easily you can die.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.434
Are you kidding me?
'Cause every last person

17:16.435 --> 17:17.769
who's still alive on this planet

17:17.770 --> 17:19.404
realizes how easily
they can die.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.271
Well, I'm not gonna
let it be you.

17:21.272 --> 17:24.008
I'm not saying this is gonna
work. I'm saying it might work.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.243
But if you go in there
instead of me,

17:26.244 --> 17:28.313
it will not work, okay?

17:28.314 --> 17:31.182
We got to take risks
as a family, okay?

17:31.183 --> 17:34.018
You going in there is no different
than me going in there.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.854
Me going in there is no different
than you going in there.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.290
It's all about who has
the best chance of coming out.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.959
And that's me.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.062
Making yourself invisible
to the enemy

17:44.063 --> 17:46.397
is a basic tactic, Tom.

17:46.398 --> 17:50.968
I think it's your best shot.
But it's your call.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.006
We still don't know
how to kill one of these things

17:55.007 --> 17:57.141
without making any noise,
so until we figure that out,

17:57.142 --> 18:00.942
I don't have to make a call.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.114
- Without making any noise?
- HAL: Yeah.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.782
Do you think
it's gonna be sleeping

18:04.783 --> 18:07.018
in some soundproof chamber
with its head in a guillotine?

18:07.019 --> 18:10.853
Probably not.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.191
There is one thing.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.961
Mike hit him -- it --
in its mouth the other day.

18:16.962 --> 18:18.796
It seemed
to knock it unconscious.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.631
We know
that there's a soft palate.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.734
If the nerve center
is in there,

18:22.735 --> 18:25.636
we know it's connected
to the base of the brain stem.

18:25.637 --> 18:29.801
That means,
theoretically...

18:29.875 --> 18:32.375
Can you open that?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.617
[Skitter snarling, screeching]

18:51.196 --> 18:52.830
Anne.

18:52.831 --> 18:56.601
I'm not gonna let Hal
risk his life on a theory.

18:56.602 --> 18:57.869
Anne, don't!
[grunts]

18:57.870 --> 19:00.370

[breathing heavily]

19:23.829 --> 19:26.329
[scalpel clatters]

19:28.801 --> 19:31.301
Okay. That worked.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.847
We had to know
how to do it.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.816
You. Hal. Me.

19:44.817 --> 19:48.253
All of us --
the human race.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.987
I know.

19:49.988 --> 19:54.358
And don't think it was hard
for me -- because it wasn't.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.761
All I had to do
was think about my family.

19:56.762 --> 20:02.997
I just pictured them for one
second, and that's all it took.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.368
You and Kate and Scott --

20:04.369 --> 20:06.871
you guys all want me
to have a picture up here,

20:06.872 --> 20:09.440
but I didn't want to tell you --
I don't have anything.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.342
I don't have one single
photograph.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.144
I don't have a truck.
I don't --

20:13.145 --> 20:15.113
I don't have
a boris bear. I don't --

20:15.114 --> 20:17.181
[gasping]

20:17.182 --> 20:19.682
All I have is this.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.965
[thudding]

20:49.515 --> 20:52.609
[thudding continues]

21:00.058 --> 21:03.221
Okay. Tell me.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.196
Left at the first corridor,
lobby,

21:05.197 --> 21:06.998
Ieft at second corridor,
right.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.600
The next corridor is Ben's,
the south corridor.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.502
Third door on the right.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.171
Reference?

21:13.172 --> 21:15.540
Moon falling
in the east-southeast.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.542
All right, Weaver told you
that the slower you go,

21:17.543 --> 21:19.377
the less noise
you're gonna make, right?

21:19.378 --> 21:21.512
- Yeah. I got it.
- What's the distress signal?

21:21.513 --> 21:24.015
I yell "help" as loud as I can.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.616
Don't joke.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.218
One flash out the window.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.719
- What's the "ready" signal?
- Three flashes.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.980
All right, turn around.
Let me see that thing.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.429
You know, ever since you were
a little kid, you could --

21:38.430 --> 21:41.332
you could do anything with
your body, with your hands.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.701
You threw a perfect football
when you were 2.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.369
It's called a spiral, dad.

21:45.370 --> 21:48.168
Yeah.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.232
And you can be stubborn.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.644
Sometimes
that's a good thing.

21:53.645 --> 21:57.081
Anything you wanted to get done,
you got done.

21:57.082 --> 22:03.248
And if anybody can do this,
it's you.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.822
All right, 15 minutes.

22:06.024 --> 22:07.758
Give me that signal,
or I come in after you.

22:07.759 --> 22:11.128
Well, you give me 10,
and you'll be looking for me.

22:11.129 --> 22:13.629
Hey. Come here.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.536
See you in a few.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.211

[Skitter grunts]

23:47.693 --> 23:50.193
[hinges creak]

23:55.767 --> 24:00.795
No Skitters in sight.
So far, so good.

24:00.872 --> 24:03.466
It doesn't feel like that.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.714
[Skitter hisses]

25:23.455 --> 25:25.955
[Skitter whimpers]

25:38.537 --> 25:41.037
[Skitter whimpers]

25:56.354 --> 25:58.289
It's been 20 minutes.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.724
- How long should it take?
- Not this long.

26:00.725 --> 26:04.265
All right.
I'm gonna go check on him.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.936
[thudding]

26:22.881 --> 26:25.916
Tom! We need to wait
for the signal!

26:25.917 --> 26:28.417
Come on.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.960
You got a plan, boss?

26:37.996 --> 26:39.396
If I can get
to Ben's room,

26:39.397 --> 26:41.866
I might be able to find
another entrance.

26:41.867 --> 26:45.860
[thudding, whirring]

26:45.937 --> 26:51.239
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Go, go, go, go, go!

26:51.309 --> 26:54.039
Okay.
I know another way.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.446
Show me.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.214
You guys stay here,
wait for the signal.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.715
Okay.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.616
[Skitter snorts]

27:52.871 --> 27:56.204
Ben.

27:56.274 --> 27:58.774

[Skitter wheezes]

28:29.240 --> 28:31.375
- You okay?
- I got him.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.010
Okay.

28:33.011 --> 28:36.105
Ben.
Ben.

28:36.181 --> 28:40.991
Ben, I'm taking you home.
We're taking all of them.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.431
We got to go.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.769
[grunting]

29:09.214 --> 29:12.116
TOM:
Put each kid on a stretcher along the wall.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.151
Monitor all their vitals,
let me know of any changes.

29:14.152 --> 29:18.122
We're doing the surgeries
one after the other.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.124
TOM:
Don't worry, Ben. I got you.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.892
ANNE:
I need 10cc of morphine, stat.

29:21.893 --> 29:23.293
WOMAN:
Hand me another blanket.

29:23.294 --> 29:24.628
You might not want
to be here.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.363
No, this is exactly
where I want to be.

29:26.364 --> 29:28.065
Let's just get this thing
off of him.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.600
WOMAN:
Careful! Careful!

29:29.601 --> 29:31.435
ANNE:
Blood pressure?

29:31.436 --> 29:35.099
110/70.

29:35.173 --> 29:38.008
- MAN: More gauze!
- TOM: I got this.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.943
Let's get the l.V.S
in all the other patients.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.612
WOMAN:
Make sure those needles are sterile!

29:41.613 --> 29:45.049
MAN:
Okay. Let's go! Let's go!

29:45.116 --> 29:49.086
Something's happening.
His pressure's dropping.

29:49.087 --> 29:51.121
- This one's pulse is dropping, too!
- TOM: Hang on, Ben.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.558
[indistinct shouting]

29:54.626 --> 29:58.118
[grunts]

29:58.196 --> 29:59.930
Ben, hang in there.
It's Dad.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.899
Pulse is picking back up.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.834
All right, let's get him down.
Let's get her up.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.236
What's happening?
- This one's pulse is faint.

30:06.237 --> 30:10.107
ANNE:
All right, let's speed up the prep.
Let's get everyone ready.

30:10.108 --> 30:11.875
Tom, I need you
to cut off his shirt.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.877
SCOTT:
This one's having trouble breathing!

30:13.878 --> 30:15.379
They're going
into withdrawal!

30:15.380 --> 30:18.782
All right, lift the harness.
Let's get this done.

30:18.783 --> 30:20.184
BP's 90/50.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.881
Hold her steady.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.454
[gasping]

30:27.792 --> 30:30.060
SCOTT:
No pulse! Somebody give me a hand!

30:30.061 --> 30:32.162
We need to get him
to the table!

30:32.163 --> 30:34.663
This is the last patient!

30:37.836 --> 30:40.270
[ball thuds]

30:40.271 --> 30:41.872
[hissing]

30:41.873 --> 30:45.400
[grunting]

30:45.477 --> 30:48.307
Turn him over.
Watch his head.

30:51.249 --> 30:54.343
One, two, three,
four, five...

30:54.419 --> 30:57.252
eight, nine.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.822
[grunting softly]

31:04.529 --> 31:06.196
I'm not getting a pulse.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.065
I don't have a pulse.

31:08.066 --> 31:12.196
[grunting continues]
He's gone, Anne.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.404
He's gone.
He's gone. He's gone.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.905
[breathing heavily]

31:22.247 --> 31:25.307
I don't know
what went wrong.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.263
TOM:
Anne.

31:39.264 --> 31:42.427
You saved five.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.094
I lost one.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.580
[indistinct conversations]

32:07.892 --> 32:10.127
[door opens]

32:10.128 --> 32:12.396
MARGARET:
You should get that hand looked at.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.732
They've been
a little busy in there.

32:15.733 --> 32:18.258
Hey, um...

32:18.336 --> 32:21.305
thanks for what you did
back there.

32:21.306 --> 32:22.940
It was all your dad.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.309
Yeah, he said that you knew a
different way into the hospital.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.944
Through the nurses'
locker room.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.313
I used to hang out with them
during their cigarette breaks.

32:29.314 --> 32:33.550
So when you were visiting
your aunt at the hospital,

32:33.551 --> 32:36.019
you were hanging out
with the nurses?

32:36.020 --> 32:40.821
Something like that.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.926
Friends with all
the drug dealers in town,

32:42.927 --> 32:44.528
all the nurses
in the hospital --

32:44.529 --> 32:47.364
you must have been
one popular girl.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.865
[chuckles]

32:56.040 --> 32:59.806
I had cancer
when I was 16.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.948
So...

33:04.949 --> 33:08.009
um...

33:08.286 --> 33:09.920
[chuckles]

33:09.921 --> 33:13.991
One of the doctors
told me to smoke pot to --

33:13.992 --> 33:16.960
you know,
for the nausea, whatever.

33:16.961 --> 33:21.298
And, um, so I'd go
to this guy's house, and...

33:21.299 --> 33:23.800
he would, like,
show off for me, I guess.

33:23.801 --> 33:26.069
I don't know why. I wasn't
looking so good in those days,

33:26.070 --> 33:30.940
with the whole no hair
from the chemo and everything.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.277
What kind of cancer?

33:35.346 --> 33:37.514
It was bad.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.015
Had a 50/50 chance.

33:41.319 --> 33:45.312
Those odds make you
think differently.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.361
I'm glad you made it.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.500
[chuckles]

34:06.978 --> 34:09.980
Dad, guard told me Ben
pulled through. How is he?

34:09.981 --> 34:12.710
He's still unconscious.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.751
Probably until
sometime tomorrow.

34:14.752 --> 34:17.346
We got him back.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.656
You did.

34:19.657 --> 34:23.092
[sighs]
You got him back.

34:26.764 --> 34:31.929
You were
incredibly brave tonight.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.670
And I'm so proud of you.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.038
[chuckles]
I know, Dad.

34:35.039 --> 34:36.606
- You don't know.
- That's okay.

34:36.607 --> 34:38.041
You don't know.

34:38.042 --> 34:39.810
[inhales deeply]

34:39.811 --> 34:44.976
You don't know what it's like
to be a father...

34:45.049 --> 34:49.382
...and to see your son
grow into a man.

34:49.454 --> 34:52.650
He's still your kid, but...

34:52.724 --> 34:55.224
a man, like you...

34:56.127 --> 34:59.392
and in so many ways...

34:59.464 --> 35:02.365
better than you.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.994
- I'm not.
- Hey, it's what we want.

35:06.070 --> 35:09.062
We want you
to be better.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.640
[door opens]

35:17.648 --> 35:20.148
[indistinct conversations]

35:26.691 --> 35:29.191
Oh, my God.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.960
It's beautiful.

35:35.733 --> 35:39.066
Every bead
represents a wish

35:39.137 --> 35:41.104
or a good thought...

35:41.105 --> 35:43.605
or a piece of advice...

35:43.608 --> 35:46.043
so that when you go
into labor

35:46.044 --> 35:48.645
and you put
this bracelet on,

35:48.646 --> 35:49.980
you'll have all of us

35:49.981 --> 35:51.848
right there with you.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.784
And you have to remember,

35:53.785 --> 35:56.586
with this child,
it's yours...

35:56.587 --> 35:59.852
and it's not yours.

35:59.924 --> 36:05.184
As soon as it's born, you
have to start setting it free.

36:07.698 --> 36:10.462
I hope that your child

36:10.535 --> 36:13.993
is courageous
and strong and lucky.

36:14.072 --> 36:16.640
And I hope
that they will face life,

36:16.641 --> 36:19.166
the good and the bad...

36:19.243 --> 36:22.178
all of it.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.160
Somebody's up tonight.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.630
Take a listen.

36:44.735 --> 36:48.785
The heartbeat's really fast.
Is that normal?

36:54.011 --> 36:55.545
[chuckles]

36:55.546 --> 36:57.848
It's supposed to
be that fast.

36:57.849 --> 37:01.285
Your baby
sounds just fine.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.002
Come here.

38:12.023 --> 38:16.153

I'm asleep right now.

Hey.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.123
You did it.
