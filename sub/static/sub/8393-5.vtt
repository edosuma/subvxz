09:53.520 --> 09:54.657
- YOU'RE UP.
WE'RE BOTH UP.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.796
- YOU WERE POKING ME.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.959
- I THINK WE SHOULD GO JOGGING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:59.080 --> 10:00.729
- JOGGING? WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.387
I JUST FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,

10:02.490 --> 10:08.326
WE'RE THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE
THE ATHLETIC...PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

10:08.430 --> 10:10.603
LET'S GO JOGGING.
OOPS.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.223

WE NEVER JOGGED BEFORE,

10:19.510 --> 10:20.818

10:51.750 --> 10:52.819

I WASN'T STARING.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.023
[laughs]
I'M NOT PACING.

10:54.130 --> 10:55.813
- DUDE, YOU WERE STARING
RIGHT AT ME--

10:55.930 --> 10:57.238
- I JUST ENTERED A ROOM.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.819
- WELL, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
SPIT IT OUT,

10:58.930 --> 10:59.783
'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO FINISH THIS,
'CAUSE I'VE GOT

10:59.900 --> 11:00.821
TO GET OUT OF HERE
EARLY TODAY.

11:00.930 --> 11:02.898
- OKAY.
[clucks tongue]

11:03.000 --> 11:04.729
- [sighs]
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.172
- OKAY, UH, WELL, I WAS,

11:06.280 --> 11:08.965
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY,

11:09.080 --> 11:11.662
AND I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD.

11:11.770 --> 11:12.976
- YEAH,
WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.069
- I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN
AT IT FOR A YEAR,

11:14.190 --> 11:16.249
AND WE ALREADY HAVE
A FEW EMPLOYEES.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.907
WE GOT A LITTLE EXTRA CHEDDAR
IN THE BANK ACCOUNT.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.351
THAT'S NICE.
- YEAH, A LITTLE.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.530
- NICE LITTLE NEST EGG.
- I WOULDN'T CALL IT A NEST EGG.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.119
- MM, IT'S PRETTY ROBUST
BY MY, UH--

11:24.230 --> 11:24.707
- CROS, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
GET TO THE POINT.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.266
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:27.370 --> 11:31.090
- I THOUGHT MAYBE WE
COULD CHAT ABOUT MY SALARY.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.449
- CROSBY, I-I CAN'T
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

11:37.550 --> 11:40.246
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T?
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY SALARY.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.102
- I KNOW THAT. I CAN'T--
- WHEN WE STARTED THIS,

11:42.210 --> 11:44.553
I TOOK A PRETTY BIG CUT AND...
- SO DID I.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.117
- IT WASN'T AS BRUTAL AS MINE.
- NO, IT WAS THE SAME.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.426
THE SAME AMOUNT OF BRUTALNESS.

11:48.530 --> 11:49.872
WE EACH AGREED
TO TAKE A 25% CUT

11:49.980 --> 11:51.254
IN THE SALARIES
THAT WE HAD AT THE TIME.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.975
OKAY, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT WELL.
- YEAH, BUT THAT ENDED UP

11:53.090 --> 11:53.806
PUTTING YOU AT ALMOST TWICE
AS MUCH AS ME.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.184
- NO, NOT AT TWICE AS MUCH.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.291
- THAT'S WHY I SAID "ALMOST."
DID YOU HEAR THAT PART?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.391
- CROSBY, WE AGREED
EACH TO TAKE 25% LESS

12:00.510 --> 12:01.954
THAN WE'D BEEN MAKING
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS WORK.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.402
- YEAH, I REMEMBER.
- OKAY?

12:03.510 --> 12:05.023
THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED WAS FAIR.
- AND AT THAT TIME--

12:05.130 --> 12:07.507
AT THAT TIME, IT WAS FAIR.
BUT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR.

12:07.620 --> 12:08.689
- CROSBY, I JUST TOLD YOU,

12:08.790 --> 12:09.370
I HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE EARLY, OKAY?

12:09.480 --> 12:10.924
I GOT A LOT ON MY PLATE,

12:11.040 --> 12:12.416
SO JUST ASK ME LATER.
LET ME FINISH THIS.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.748
- I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU LATER.

12:13.870 --> 12:15.269
I DIDN'T WANT TO ASK YOU NOW.
THAT WAS NOT FUN.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.517
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:16.630 --> 12:17.699
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.903
LET'S JUST WAIT
UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR

12:19.010 --> 12:19.931
WHEN WE HAVE
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW--

12:20.040 --> 12:21.280
- THE END OF THE YEAR?
- YEAH.

12:21.390 --> 12:22.425
- THAT'S WHEN YOU W--OKAY.
- THE END OF THE YEAR.

12:22.530 --> 12:23.906
THAT'S WHEN I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.147
- GREAT, GREAT.
MAYBE AT MY RETIREMENT PARTY,

12:25.260 --> 12:29.117

15:54.090 --> 15:56.604
DID SOME FIRST-YEAR ASSOCIATE
SCREW IT UP?

15:56.710 --> 15:57.699

16:09.520 --> 16:11.545
THAT YOU AGREED
TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.108

THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING.

16:28.430 --> 16:31.183

AND IT HAS NOT
BEEN GOING SMOOTHLY,

16:39.300 --> 16:42.064

UH, NO, YOU JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
TO THE VET CENTER

17:17.720 --> 17:19.779

TO GET STARTED AGAIN.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.808

17:41.920 --> 17:43.194
OKAY, YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE REASON

17:43.300 --> 17:44.847
WHY I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO THE VET CENTER?

17:44.960 --> 17:45.949
BECAUSE I'M SICK OF PEOPLE

17:46.060 --> 17:47.982
LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I'M A VETERAN.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.192
LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME,

17:49.300 --> 17:50.471
LIKE IT'S BROKEN OR SOMETHING.
- I KNOW.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.263
- I DON'T WANT TO BE A VETERAN.
I'M JUST RYAN.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.065
AND THE REASON I DIDN'T GO
TO THE CRAPPY JOB INTERVIEW

17:55.170 --> 17:57.377
IS BECAUSE THE JOB SUCKED.

17:57.490 --> 17:58.616

TO START SOMEWHERE, SON.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.379

- YEAH, I CAN'T REALLY
STOP THINKING ABOUT MOM.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.675
- OKAY, WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S NORMAL

18:22.790 --> 18:23.927
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

18:24.030 --> 18:26.885
WE JUST WANT YOU TO STAY
POSITIVE AND BE STRONG, OKAY?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.376
- YEAH, I-I'M, LIKE, KIND OF
HAVING A HARD TIME FOCUSING,

18:28.480 --> 18:30.960
LIKE I SHOULD
BE DOING SOMETHING.

18:31.070 --> 18:33.061
- LOOK, HADDIE, WE JUST--
WE JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.488
YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS
ON YOUR SCHOOLWORK, OKAY?

18:34.590 --> 18:35.511
WE'RE--WE'RE TAKING CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.177
YOU JUST DON'T WORRY.
- YEAH.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.078
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION,
AND I'M REALLY FAR AWAY,

18:40.180 --> 18:41.283
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

18:41.390 --> 18:42.698
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.118
DON'T WORRY, AND JUST FOCUS
ON YOUR BOOKS, OKAY?

18:44.220 --> 18:45.357
GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT OF--
- STOP, WHAT?

18:45.460 --> 18:47.189
- HUH?
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

18:47.290 --> 18:48.325
FOCUS ON SCHOOL?

18:48.430 --> 18:49.670
- JUST FOCUS ON SCHOOL.
DON'T BE--

18:49.780 --> 18:50.599
- DAD, IT'S, LIKE, HARD.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.985
I'M JUST REALLY FAR AWAY
FROM HOME.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.364
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, LIKE,

18:54.470 --> 18:57.337
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ANY INFORMATION.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.259
HELLO?

18:58.370 --> 19:02.682
CAN YOU TREAT ME
LIKE AN ADULT?

19:02.790 --> 19:07.306
- OKAY.

19:07.420 --> 19:12.346
YOUR MOTHER'S TUMOR
IS 1.6 CENTIMETERS, OKAY?

19:12.460 --> 19:15.588
SO THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO A LUMPECTOMY.

19:15.700 --> 19:16.974
THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET THE TUMOR OUT

19:17.080 --> 19:20.186
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO
A MASTECTOMY, SO THAT'S GOOD.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.700
AND--AND WHILE THEY'RE DOING
THE LUMPECTOMY,

19:21.810 --> 19:26.702
THEY'RE GONNA DO
A BIOPSY OF TWO LYMPH NODES

19:26.820 --> 19:28.435
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW CANCER
USUALLY SPREADS,

19:28.540 --> 19:29.711
SO THEY'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO TELL

19:29.820 --> 19:31.435
WHETHER YOUR MOTHER NEEDS
ANY FURTHER TREATMENT,

19:31.540 --> 19:35.920
CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.895
OKAY?
- SO SHE MIGHT NEED CHEMO?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.299
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
SHE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

19:41.420 --> 19:43.103
BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH.
THAT'S AS MUCH AS I KNOW.

19:43.210 --> 19:46.099
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.906
AND I PROMISE YOU
I WILL KEEP YOU UP-TO-DATE.

19:49.010 --> 19:51.934
I DON'T WANT YOU IN THE DARK.
- OKAY. HOW ARE YOU?

19:52.050 --> 19:55.463
- [laughs]

19:55.570 --> 19:59.085
YOU KNOW, I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M HANGING IN THERE.

19:59.190 --> 20:00.873
YEP.

20:00.990 --> 20:05.677
IT'S SCARY,
BUT I'M OKAY.

20:05.790 --> 20:11.399
YEP.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.819
SO...YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
THAT YOUR MOTHER IS...

20:14.930 --> 20:17.967
[sniffs] SO STRONG,
AND SHE'S SO POSITIVE,

20:18.070 --> 20:21.073
AND SHE IS DOING EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO GET HEALTHY.

20:21.180 --> 20:24.525
AND THE BEST THING THAT YOU
CAN DO FOR YOUR MOM RIGHT NOW,

20:24.630 --> 20:27.838
HADDIE, IS JUST--
YOU JUST FOCUS ON SCHOOL.

20:27.950 --> 20:32.660
AND YOU DO WELL,
AND YOU MAKE HER PROUD, OKAY?

20:32.780 --> 20:35.749
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
- YEAH.

20:35.850 --> 20:39.741
- OKAY, GOOD.

20:39.850 --> 20:40.430
LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO WORK HERE,

20:40.540 --> 20:42.428
BUT I LOVE YOU, OKAY?

20:42.550 --> 20:45.064
- MM-HMM.
LOVE YOU TOO.

20:45.170 --> 20:49.129
- BYE.
[inhales deeply]

20:49.240 --> 20:52.960
[sighs]

21:02.330 --> 21:03.217
- AND YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT ALL THIS MEANS?

21:03.330 --> 21:04.467
- YEAH, MOM'S GOT CANCER.

21:04.570 --> 21:07.255
- OKAY.
- BUT I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.748
- SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.
- OKAY.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.533
- BUT SHE'S GONNA HAVE
TO GO THROUGH SOME THINGS,

21:10.640 --> 21:11.572
NOT GONNA HAVE
AS MUCH TIME FOR YOU,

21:11.680 --> 21:12.988
SHE'S GONNA NEED TO REST,

21:13.090 --> 21:14.534
SHE'S GOING TO NEED TO GO
TO DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS.

21:14.650 --> 21:18.689
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO BE A LITTLE MORE GROWN UP.

21:18.790 --> 21:21.714
- OKAY.

21:25.420 --> 21:26.557
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS, BUDDY?

21:26.660 --> 21:30.175
DO YOU WANT TO ASK ME
ANYTHING OR...?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.793
- CAN I WATCH TV NOW?

21:31.910 --> 21:33.525
I HAVE 30 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME
BANKED FROM LAST NIGHT.

21:33.630 --> 21:37.498
- [chuckles]
SURE.

21:41.740 --> 21:42.843
- HMM.

21:42.950 --> 21:46.056
- THINK HE CARES?
THINK HE UNDERSTANDS?

21:46.160 --> 21:48.299
- YEAH.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.371
- WHY ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE
COMING TO MY GAME?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.129
- THEY'RE NOT "THESE PEOPLE,"
THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.174
THEY'RE--THEY'RE OUR FAMILY.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE COMING.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.589
- ONLY GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
CAME TO MY RECITAL. SO NOT FAIR.

22:03.700 --> 22:04.689
- QUIT WHINING. SUCH A BABY.
- I'M NOT WHINING!

22:04.800 --> 22:06.415
- THEY'RE COMING
TO THE GAME TOO.

22:06.530 --> 22:07.519
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S WHINING.
- YOU'RE JUST A BABY.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.837
- HEY,
DON'T CALL HER THAT, OKAY?

22:09.940 --> 22:11.259
- I MIGHT NOT EVEN
GET IN THE GAME.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.327
- YOU'RE GONNA
GET INTO THE GAME.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.909
- I'M THE WORST PLAYER
ON THE TEAM.

22:14.020 --> 22:16.250
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU GAVE ME TWO KNIVES.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.634
YOU NEED A KNIFE.
THERE.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.320
- MOM, DO I EVEN HAVE TO GO
TO THIS STUPID GAME?

22:19.440 --> 22:20.702
- [groans]
[alarm beeping]

22:20.820 --> 22:22.572
- THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF!
- MOM.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.092
MOM, MOM,
THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.192
MOM!

22:28.310 --> 22:29.709
[faint]
THE EGGS ARE BURNING.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.161
[knife scraping loudly]
MOM!

22:31.280 --> 22:33.919
MOM, I AM TALKING TO YOU.
WHY ARE YOU NOT ANSWERING ME?

22:34.040 --> 22:37.032
- GUYS, WHAT IS GOING ON?
- MOM, THE EGGS ARE BURNING.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.209
- MOM, WE'RE NOT--DAD.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.242
- SYD, VICTOR,
GO TO THE OTHER ROOM.

22:40.350 --> 22:41.385
- WE DIDN'T EVEN GET OUR--
- NOW!

22:41.490 --> 22:42.422
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
- GO, GO!

22:42.530 --> 22:43.554
- DAD, IT'S NOT FAIR!

22:43.670 --> 22:47.777
[alarm beeping]
- HEY, HONEY.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.040
YOU OKAY?
- [hyperventilatlng]

22:49.160 --> 22:50.320
UH-UH, NO,
I'M NOT ALL RIGHT.

22:50.430 --> 22:53.365
- HEY, HEY, HEY, JULIA.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.916
HEY, HONEY, HONEY.
- [sobbing]

22:56.020 --> 22:57.647
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:57.750 --> 23:00.992
JUST BREATHE HERE, OKAY?
JUST BREATHE.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.443

- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.642
ALL RIGHT, JUST BREATHE.
- [gaspmg]

23:04.760 --> 23:07.035
- JUST BREATHE.
- I CAN'T DO IT.

23:07.140 --> 23:08.232
IT'S TOO MUCH, I CAN'T--

23:08.350 --> 23:10.272
- WHAT CAN'T YOU DO? WHAT?
- I CAN'T...

23:10.380 --> 23:15.408
[shuddering]

23:15.530 --> 23:18.385
[soft rock music]

23:21.840 --> 23:23.728
- WELL, IT WAS GOOD
THAT YOU WENT TO SEE HIM.

23:23.850 --> 23:27.707
THAT WAS AMGMOOD THING.

23:27.820 --> 23:31.608
YEAH, I MEAN, HE ONLY SLAMMED
THE DOOR IN MY FACE.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.096
- WELL, AT LEAST HE KNEW
THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE

23:33.200 --> 23:36.408
WHO CARED ENOUGH ABOUT HIM
TO CHECK UP ON HIM.

23:36.510 --> 23:39.513
YOU KNOW, POOR KID,
HE'S PROBABLY CONFUSED.

23:39.620 --> 23:43.863
HE'S CERTAINLY ANGRY

23:43.970 --> 23:47.690
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE BELONGS.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.141
- YEAH.

23:48.250 --> 23:52.971
- YEAH.

23:53.080 --> 23:57.016
IT WAS A LONG TIME
BEFORE YOU CAME BACK TO ME.

24:03.090 --> 24:06.981
- WELL, THANK GOD
I HAD SOMEONE TO COME BACK TO.

24:23.250 --> 24:26.595
- WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME?

24:26.700 --> 24:29.214
- ARE YOU A GROWN-UP?
- WHY DO YOU ASK?

24:29.320 --> 24:34.496
- WELL, MY PARENTS SAID I NEED
TO BE MORE GROWN UP.

24:34.610 --> 24:38.671
SO ARE YOU A GROWN-UP?

24:38.780 --> 24:40.361
- WELL...
[sighs]

24:40.470 --> 24:44.304
I GUESS SO, YEAH.

24:44.410 --> 24:45.684
- YOU DON'T DRESS
LIKE A GROWN-UP.

24:45.790 --> 24:48.065
- NO, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T.

24:48.170 --> 24:52.174
- AND YOU'RE SHORTER
THAN A LOT OF GROWN-UPS.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.895
- THAT'S SO TRUE.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.412
- SO WHAT MAKES YOU
A GROWN-UP?

24:56.520 --> 24:59.626
- [sighs]

24:59.730 --> 25:03.006
WELL, UH, LET'S SEE,
I HAVE, UM...

25:03.120 --> 25:04.189
I HAVE A JOB.

25:04.290 --> 25:07.179
AND, UM,
I HAVE A CAR.

25:07.290 --> 25:09.042
AND I HAVE TO PAY BILLS

25:09.160 --> 25:13.529
AND JUST KIND OF DO STUFF
ON MY OWN, I GUESS.

25:13.650 --> 25:15.436
- YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.

25:15.540 --> 25:18.407
- NO, I'M NOT.

25:18.510 --> 25:19.716
- ALL OF THE ADULTS I KNOW
ARE MARRIED.

25:19.820 --> 25:22.402
SO WHEN ARE YOU
GETTING MARRIED?

25:22.520 --> 25:26.923
- WELL...I GUESS I'D HAVE
TO MEET THE RIGHT PERSON FIRST.

25:30.830 --> 25:31.933
- MY MOM'S GOT CANCER.

25:37.050 --> 25:39.450
- DO YOU WANT 1N?) TALK ABOUT IT?

25:39.570 --> 25:42.016
- OKAY.

25:45.780 --> 25:46.292

25:56.270 --> 25:56.577
[sighs]

25:56.690 --> 25:59.750

25:59.860 --> 26:03.375

26:16.980 --> 26:18.845
IT WAS NOTHING.
- NO, I DO UNDERSTAND--

26:18.950 --> 26:20.429
- ALL RIGHT, IT WAS NOTHING.
YOU GOT CLOSE TO ME.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.747

I GOT--

26:22.850 --> 26:25.717
OH, I GOT--I GET IT.

26:25.820 --> 26:26.809
I'M SORRY.

26:32.450 --> 26:33.929
KISS ME?
THAT'S--I DIDN'T--

26:34.040 --> 26:35.996
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A BOUNDARY THERE.

26:36.110 --> 26:39.728
- IT WAS NOTHING, IT WAS...
- OH, MY GOD.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.593
- [laughs]
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF?

26:41.700 --> 26:43.008
I MEAN, I KNOW,
I'M DELIGHTFUL.

26:43.110 --> 26:44.759

26:48.500 --> 26:50.218

26:50.330 --> 26:51.774
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.053
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND.
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT, ALL RIGHT?

26:54.160 --> 26:56.082
- OKAY, NO, IT'S FINE.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.952

26:59.300 --> 27:01.052
- CAN IJUST EAT IN PEACE?

27:01.170 --> 27:03.195
- CAN I JUST WORK
IN THE DARKROOM IN PEACE?

27:03.310 --> 27:04.379
IT'S LIKE, NOW I DON'T KNOW
IF SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN,

27:04.480 --> 27:05.447
LIKE IF I GET
TOO IN YOUR SPACE--

27:05.550 --> 27:09.680
- FINE, OKAY,
IT WASN'T NOTHING.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.824
- WELL, I DON'T--
I DIDN'T MEAN--

27:10.930 --> 27:14.650
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT--
[sighs]

27:14.770 --> 27:20.003

27:20.120 --> 27:22.634
YOU'RE FUNNY.

27:22.740 --> 27:25.664
YOU'RE PRETTY,

27:56.910 --> 27:58.730
YOU WERE RUDE TO ME BEFORE.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.943

28:00.050 --> 28:00.869
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

YOU SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.539
- HEY, WHATEVER YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE,

28:05.640 --> 28:07.437
WHATEVER YOU THINK

28:07.540 --> 28:10.100
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP, ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.919

32:27.080 --> 32:29.696
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD HAVE A CHITCHAT.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.495
- IT'S TOO CLOSE TO PUT HIM IN.
THIS GAME'S TOO CLOSE.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.569
THERE'LL BE OTHER GAMES, ZEEK.
IT'S A LONG SEASON.

32:34.670 --> 32:36.149
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T PUT HIM
IN THE GAME NOW,

32:36.260 --> 32:37.295
HE MAY NOT SHOW UP
FOR THE OTHER GAMES, ALL RIGHT?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.948

TO MAKE SURE

32:58.560 --> 33:01.028
THAT WE COULD PLAY BASEBALL
ON AMERICAN SOIL.

33:01.150 --> 33:03.141

33:03.250 --> 33:04.558
- NO, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT THE PROBLEM--

33:04.670 --> 33:07.070
THE PROB--LOOK, IS IT REALLY
ABOUT WINNING THE GAME,

33:07.190 --> 33:08.077
OR IS IT ABOUT
JUST PUTTING THE KIDS IN

33:08.190 --> 33:10.533
AND LETTING THEM PARTICIPATE

33:10.640 --> 33:12.153
