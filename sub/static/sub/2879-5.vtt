00:02.582 --> 00:04.592
Oh, hey, Stuart,
I got you

00:04.593 --> 00:07.126
a little souvenir
from my trip to space.

00:07.128 --> 00:09.596
Well, Howard,
that's very nice of you.

00:09.598 --> 00:11.598
Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.834
It's my official
NASA portrait.

00:17.371 --> 00:20.406
"To Stuart, your comic book
store is out of this world.

00:20.408 --> 00:23.610
Just like the guy
in this picture was."

00:23.612 --> 00:25.879
For the record, he also thinks
the Walgreens

00:25.881 --> 00:29.549
and the dry cleaners
are out of this world.

00:29.551 --> 00:30.717
That's not true.

00:30.719 --> 00:32.051
At the Walgreens,

00:32.052 --> 00:36.022
I was "over the moon"
for their store-brand antacids.

00:36.024 --> 00:37.757
Hey, Stuart, I see
you're getting ready

00:37.759 --> 00:38.925
for your Halloween party.

00:38.927 --> 00:41.628
Yeah, it's my annual attempt
to meet women.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.897
Ninth time's the charm.

00:45.099 --> 00:46.633
Would you like me to help?

00:46.635 --> 00:49.936
I do have a certain je ne sais
quois when it comes to soirees.

00:49.938 --> 00:52.405
Thanks, but I can't afford
je ne sais quois.

00:52.407 --> 00:54.674
How much for just quois?

00:54.676 --> 00:56.309
You know,
you don't worry about money.

00:56.311 --> 00:58.278
I'll take care of everything.
Really?

00:58.280 --> 01:00.813
Yeah, you'll love it. Ain't no
party like a Koothra-party.

01:03.151 --> 01:04.884
But you know
what wasn't a party?

01:04.885 --> 01:06.019
That hotel in Kazakhstan

01:06.021 --> 01:07.720
they put you up in
before the launch.

01:07.722 --> 01:09.022
I mean,
it's your last night on Earth.

01:09.024 --> 01:10.790
You'd think you'd get
one porn channel.

01:12.359 --> 01:14.460
Have you noticed
that Howard can take any topic

01:14.462 --> 01:17.964
and use it to remind you
that he went to space?

01:17.966 --> 01:20.033
Interesting hypothesis.

01:20.035 --> 01:21.267
Let's apply the
scientific method,

01:21.269 --> 01:23.636
perform an experiment.
Okay.

01:23.638 --> 01:27.073
Hey, Howard, any thoughts on
where we should get dinner?

01:27.075 --> 01:29.142
Anywhere but the Space Station.

01:30.244 --> 01:33.813
On a good day, dinner was
a bag full of meat loaf.

01:33.815 --> 01:36.099
But, hey, you don't go there
for the food,

01:36.101 --> 01:37.984
you go there for the view.

01:37.986 --> 01:39.552
It's fascinating.

01:39.554 --> 01:41.887
Let me see if I can
duplicate the result.

01:41.889 --> 01:44.440
Howard, I've
always thought

01:44.442 --> 01:46.559
the lemon was an
underrated fruit.

01:46.561 --> 01:48.394
Care to weigh in?

01:48.396 --> 01:51.748
Not really.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.499
Oh, well.

01:53.501 --> 01:55.785
You know, people say the Soyuz
capsule was a lemon.

01:57.037 --> 01:59.238
But, hey, that baby got me
to space and back.

02:34.473 --> 02:36.340
Ladies night
at the Cheesecake Factory.

02:36.342 --> 02:38.543
Does it get any better
than this?

02:38.545 --> 02:40.327
I hope so.

02:40.329 --> 02:44.198
Question. Do you think your
husband's fondness

02:44.200 --> 02:46.267
for turtlenecks is an
expression of longing

02:46.269 --> 02:49.036
for his
missing foreskin?

02:50.739 --> 02:54.559
It's not getting any better.

02:55.728 --> 02:58.279
Uch. It's Leonard.

02:58.281 --> 03:00.347
He wants to go costume
shopping later.

03:00.349 --> 03:02.233
I thought you liked Halloween.
I do, it's just

03:02.235 --> 03:04.819
he wants to go to that party
at the comic book store.

03:04.821 --> 03:07.488
A lot of the guys that hang out
there are kind of creepy.

03:07.490 --> 03:10.524
Like my husband?
And my boyfriend?

03:12.044 --> 03:13.995
I'm, I'm sorry, Amy.

03:13.997 --> 03:16.530
You were saying something
about Howard's foreskin?

03:16.532 --> 03:18.666
Nice try, but you have
to go to that party

03:18.668 --> 03:19.884
'cause we're going.

03:19.886 --> 03:20.968
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

03:20.970 --> 03:22.753
It's just not my idea
of a good time.

03:22.755 --> 03:26.040
Leonard does thing he doesn't
like to make you happy.

03:26.042 --> 03:29.543
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Isn't that, like, his job?

03:29.545 --> 03:31.262
Then what's your job?

03:31.264 --> 03:33.447
Letting him make me happy.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.601
I just think in relationships

03:36.603 --> 03:38.552
you get back
what you put into them.

03:38.554 --> 03:39.987
That's not always true.

03:39.989 --> 03:42.556
Last night I gave Sheldon
my best come-hither look,

03:42.558 --> 03:44.058
and he responded
by explaining how

03:44.060 --> 03:47.228
wheat came
to be cultivated.

03:47.230 --> 03:50.698
I guess I could probably try
a little harder.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.584
You could start by taking
an interest in his work.

03:53.586 --> 03:54.919
Yeah, that's kind of a problem.

03:54.921 --> 03:55.887
Why?

03:55.889 --> 03:58.172
Not really clear on
what he does.

03:58.174 --> 04:00.591
He's an experimental
physicist.

04:00.593 --> 04:03.577
Yeah, I'm not really clear on
what that means.

04:04.796 --> 04:07.315
He takes hypotheses
and designs protocols

04:07.317 --> 04:08.916
to determine
their accuracy.

04:08.918 --> 04:11.135
Yeah, you're really
just making it worse.

04:13.388 --> 04:15.856
What kind of tea
would you like?

04:15.858 --> 04:19.310
I think I'm gonna try
green tea

04:19.312 --> 04:20.611
mixed with lemon zinger.

04:20.613 --> 04:23.564
Two tea bags in one cup?

04:23.566 --> 04:25.783
You're not at a rave.

04:28.937 --> 04:31.706
So, listen, Sheldon,
I was thinking,

04:31.708 --> 04:33.991
since this is gonna be
our first

04:33.993 --> 04:35.743
Halloween party
as boyfriend and girlfriend,

04:35.745 --> 04:39.447
I thought it might be fun for us
to go in a couples costume.

04:39.449 --> 04:41.966
I couldn't agree more.

04:41.968 --> 04:44.218
Really? I find that inconsistent

04:44.220 --> 04:46.654
with everything I know
about you.

04:46.656 --> 04:48.789
Oh, oh, on the contrary.

04:48.791 --> 04:51.425
Couples costumes are one
of the few benefits

04:51.427 --> 04:52.893
of being in a relationship.

04:52.895 --> 04:55.396
Now imagine this:

04:55.398 --> 04:58.349
you and I entering
Stuart's party

04:58.351 --> 05:01.852
and all eyes turn to see
America's most beloved

05:01.854 --> 05:03.020
and glamorous couple.

05:03.022 --> 05:04.188
Yeah?

05:04.190 --> 05:06.807
R2-D2 and C-3PO!

05:08.343 --> 05:10.995
Dibs on 3PO.

05:10.997 --> 05:14.665
Sheldon, when I said
couples costume,

05:14.667 --> 05:16.500
I meant like Romeo and Juliet

05:16.502 --> 05:18.869
or Cinderella
and Prince Charming,

05:18.871 --> 05:22.173
not two robots from some
silly movie I don't even like.

05:22.175 --> 05:23.841
Okay!

05:26.378 --> 05:27.878
I'm gonna let that slide

05:27.880 --> 05:30.097
because I kn you're hopped up
on tea bags.

05:32.634 --> 05:35.019
I make compromises
for you all the time.

05:35.021 --> 05:37.671
Just this once,
can't we find something

05:37.673 --> 05:39.140
that we're both happy with?

05:39.142 --> 05:43.811
Fine. How about one
of the most beguiling

05:43.813 --> 05:46.947
and influential couples
of the 20th century?

05:46.949 --> 05:49.250
Hewlett and Packard.

05:50.369 --> 05:53.070
Dibs on Hewlett.

05:53.739 --> 05:55.289
What, you want to be Hewlett?

05:57.709 --> 05:59.877
Anybody home?

05:59.879 --> 06:01.879
Hey-hey-hey,
what are you doing here?

06:01.881 --> 06:04.382
I just thought I'd
stop by and say hello.

06:04.384 --> 06:06.217
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Oh.

06:06.219 --> 06:08.302
I don't think you've
ever seen my lab before.

06:08.304 --> 06:10.554
No, I know.
It's long overdue.

06:10.556 --> 06:12.006
So, what ya doing?

06:12.008 --> 06:14.892
Better not be building
a robot girlfriend.

06:14.894 --> 06:17.561
No. Although Howard was
making some real strides

06:17.563 --> 06:20.514
in that area until
he met Bernadette.

06:20.516 --> 06:22.266
You're kidding.
Nope.

06:22.268 --> 06:24.435
Now the Lisatronic 3000
just sits in a box

06:24.437 --> 06:26.070
waiting for the phone to ring.

06:29.491 --> 06:31.058
Ooh! What's going on in here?

06:31.060 --> 06:32.576
Oh, no, no, no,
don't look in there.

06:32.578 --> 06:33.727
What, is it secret?

06:33.729 --> 06:35.329
No, it's a nitrogen laser.

06:35.331 --> 06:38.416
It'll cook your eyeball
like a soft-boiled egg.

06:38.418 --> 06:40.785
Oh. You might want
to put a sign on it.

06:40.787 --> 06:44.038
Sign right there.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.091
Ah. "Danger," sure, sure.

06:47.093 --> 06:48.259
Yeah. What's, what's that?

06:48.261 --> 06:51.262
Uh, that is an
integrated ion trap

06:51.264 --> 06:53.013
and time-of-flight
mass spectrometer.

06:53.015 --> 06:55.516
Wow. High-techie-techie.

06:56.618 --> 06:58.719
What's this little box?

06:58.721 --> 07:02.890
That is a pencil
sharpener.

07:02.892 --> 07:04.809
Ooh, low-techie-techie.

07:04.811 --> 07:07.594
So, what are you
working on right now?

07:07.596 --> 07:10.114
It's actually pretty neat.
Yeah?

07:10.116 --> 07:12.616
Yeah. It's a front-projected
holographic display

07:12.618 --> 07:14.869
combined with laser-based
finger tracking.

07:14.871 --> 07:17.104
Here, I'll show you.

07:17.106 --> 07:20.291
We'll just put this
pencil over here.

07:20.293 --> 07:22.710
Sharp. Thanks to the machine
we saw earlier.

07:25.964 --> 07:27.465
Very good.

07:28.583 --> 07:33.504
And then a laser will map
the reflective surface...

07:33.506 --> 07:36.223
and voilà.

07:36.225 --> 07:40.561
Wow. That is amazing.

07:43.482 --> 07:45.933
You know, there's a foundational
idea in string theory

07:45.935 --> 07:48.736
that the whole universe
may be a hologram.

07:48.738 --> 07:50.654
What do you mean?

07:52.641 --> 07:54.641
Oh!

07:54.643 --> 07:56.243
Wow.

07:56.245 --> 07:57.361
Uh-huh.

07:57.363 --> 07:58.979
Well, the holographic principle
suggests

07:58.981 --> 08:02.816
that what we all experience
every day in three dimensions

08:02.818 --> 08:08.289
may really just be information

08:08.291 --> 08:10.157
on a surface located

08:10.159 --> 08:13.260
at the farthest reaches
of our cosmos.

08:14.463 --> 08:18.665
So it's possible
that our lives are

08:18.667 --> 08:21.101
really just acting
out a painting

08:21.103 --> 08:24.388
on the largest canvas
in the universe.

08:24.390 --> 08:26.390
Hmm.

08:26.392 --> 08:27.775
What?

08:27.777 --> 08:31.729
Sometimes I forget
how smart you are.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.687
You should visit
more often.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.625
What are you doing?

08:46.411 --> 08:48.462
Take off your clothes.

08:48.464 --> 08:50.047
What? Here? Now?

08:50.049 --> 08:51.248
Yeah. You got a problem
with that?

08:51.250 --> 08:54.218
No, no. It's kind of crazy.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.387
I've never fooled around
in the lab before.

08:56.389 --> 08:57.671
Really? Never?

08:57.673 --> 08:59.390
No. I did have a shot
with the Lisatronic,

08:59.392 --> 09:02.810
but the extension cord
wasn't long enough.

09:07.682 --> 09:10.935
Before I forget, I'd like
your opinion on the menus

09:10.937 --> 09:13.270
I've prepared
for the Halloween party.

09:13.272 --> 09:17.724
The theme is "food
that goes bump in the night."

09:18.793 --> 09:22.947
"Creature from
the Black Forest Ham Lagoon."

09:22.949 --> 09:26.917
On Sesame seed Bunzillas.

09:27.919 --> 09:32.072
"Night of the Living
Garlic Bread"?

09:32.074 --> 09:36.343
It's funny because "bread"
sounds like "dead".

09:37.929 --> 09:40.798
I'm sorry, but these
are just ordinary foods

09:40.800 --> 09:43.417
with the names bent
into tortured puns.

09:43.419 --> 09:46.520
The dishes themselves
are in no way Halloweenie.

09:46.522 --> 09:49.089
Ooh, Hallow-weenies!

09:50.442 --> 09:51.758
That's a good one.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.429
They'll pair nicely
with my "Draculoni and Cheese."

09:56.464 --> 09:58.148
How do I do it?!

10:00.118 --> 10:01.368
That reminds me, I was thinking

10:01.370 --> 10:02.936
about wearing my NASA jumpsuit
as a costume.

10:02.938 --> 10:04.655
But then I realized everyone
would be, like,

10:04.657 --> 10:05.939
"Where's your costume?

10:05.941 --> 10:08.125
Why are you wearing your work
clothes, you nut?"

10:09.661 --> 10:11.996
Hello, boys.

10:15.734 --> 10:17.084
What are you smiling at?

10:17.086 --> 10:19.670
Nothing.

10:20.572 --> 10:22.122
You know where's there's
a lot of nothing.

10:22.124 --> 10:24.141
Space.

10:28.630 --> 10:32.966
Boy, it's nice to sleep in
a bed with gravity again.

10:32.968 --> 10:34.768
Did I tell you
about the night

10:34.770 --> 10:35.686
my retainer floated out

10:35.688 --> 10:37.154
of my mouth
and into the air lock?

10:37.156 --> 10:41.992
Yeah, you mentioned it
once or twice.

10:41.994 --> 10:44.078
So, here we are,

10:44.080 --> 10:47.031
just a couple
of young newlyweds.

10:47.033 --> 10:48.666
What to do?

10:48.668 --> 10:51.251
What to do to you?

10:55.156 --> 10:59.710
Astronaut Wolowitz,
reporting for booty.

11:01.129 --> 11:03.764
Preparing thrusters.

11:04.666 --> 11:06.767
We have liftoff.

11:10.672 --> 11:13.006
Are we clear to jettison
that nightgown?

11:13.008 --> 11:15.059
Okay, we need to talk.

11:15.061 --> 11:17.111
What?

11:17.113 --> 11:18.979
Howie, I know you
went to space.

11:18.981 --> 11:20.948
I'm incredibly
proud of you.

11:20.950 --> 11:22.533
But you might want to try

11:22.535 --> 11:23.851
and not bring it up
every minute.

11:23.853 --> 11:26.537
I don't talk about it
every minute.

11:26.539 --> 11:29.690
Tonight at dinner you went on
about it for an hour straight.

11:29.692 --> 11:31.825
What was I supposed
to talk about?

11:31.827 --> 11:34.411
We were eating
at Johnny Rockets.

11:34.413 --> 11:36.880
I'm just saying,

11:36.882 --> 11:39.049
people are getting
a little tired of it.

11:39.051 --> 11:42.136
So, I did this
amazing thing

11:42.138 --> 11:45.055
and I'm never allowed
to mention it?

11:45.057 --> 11:46.540
Of course you can.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.875
But maybe a good
rule would be

11:48.877 --> 11:50.844
to wait for people
to bring it up.

11:50.846 --> 11:55.048
Okay, no problem.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.100
It won't happen again.

11:56.102 --> 11:57.884
I love you.

11:57.886 --> 11:59.386
I love you, too.

12:01.239 --> 12:04.608
I can't tell you how
many times I dreamed

12:04.610 --> 12:09.363
I was in bed here
with you when I was...

12:09.365 --> 12:11.949
you know.

12:11.951 --> 12:15.919
What, I can't even point?

12:17.000 --> 12:23.074

12:24.158 --> 12:27.794
So, basically, this is what's
called mag-lev technology.

12:27.796 --> 12:30.830
It uses very powerful
electromagnets

12:30.832 --> 12:33.549
to create a force strong
enough to overcome gravity.

12:33.551 --> 12:35.551
Here, you hold this.

12:35.553 --> 12:37.670
Whoa! That's heavy.

12:37.672 --> 12:40.139
Yeah. Oh, uh, you don't have
on any jewelry, do you?

12:40.141 --> 12:42.291
No. Why?

12:42.293 --> 12:44.811
A grad student forgot to take
out one of his piercings.

12:44.813 --> 12:47.096
Now he's on a
transplant list

12:47.098 --> 12:48.931
waiting for a
nipple his size.

12:50.267 --> 12:52.902
Now watch this.

12:55.473 --> 12:59.108
Whoa!
That is very cool.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.360
Sometimes I like
to turn this on

13:01.362 --> 13:04.497
and pretend I'm the
super villain Magneto.

13:05.783 --> 13:08.084
It's getting a little
less cool, Leonard.

13:08.086 --> 13:11.337
But what I really am is
a very smart scientist

13:11.339 --> 13:13.089
who understands the
mechanics of the universe

13:13.091 --> 13:15.441
and is wearing the sexy black
underwear you bought him.

13:15.443 --> 13:17.326
There we go.

13:19.830 --> 13:22.632
So, I thought the photo
booth for the party could

13:22.634 --> 13:24.717
either be creepy like
a mummy's tomb,

13:24.719 --> 13:27.687
or they also have the Tardis
from <i>Doctor Who.</i>

13:27.689 --> 13:29.639
A Tardis makes no sense.

13:29.641 --> 13:32.508
It's a time machine
from a science-fiction show.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.076
It has nothing to do
with Halloween.

13:34.078 --> 13:36.562
That being said,
if you don't get a Tardis,

13:36.564 --> 13:38.447
you stink
and your party stinks.

13:39.967 --> 13:41.567
Do you have a preference?

13:41.569 --> 13:43.069
I don't care. Get the Tardis.

13:43.071 --> 13:47.456
Yes! This party just
became a major rager.

13:48.408 --> 13:49.458
Oh, by the way,

13:49.460 --> 13:51.110
can I borrow your
bullwhip and fedora?

13:51.112 --> 13:53.246
Yeah, sure, whatever.

13:53.248 --> 13:56.332
I was thinking of dressing up
as Indiana Jones'

13:56.334 --> 13:58.084
mocha-skinned love child.

14:00.087 --> 14:02.672
"Indian" Jones.

14:04.141 --> 14:06.459
Clever.

14:06.461 --> 14:07.810
What's wrong with you?

14:07.812 --> 14:09.378
Nothing.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.314
Oh, Howard, I've got
a party to plan.

14:11.316 --> 14:14.116
Don't make me
pull it out of you.

14:14.118 --> 14:16.152
Okay, here it is.

14:16.154 --> 14:18.938
Bernadette said you guys are
all sick of me

14:18.940 --> 14:21.757
talking about my trip to space.

14:21.759 --> 14:23.192
Is that true?

14:23.194 --> 14:26.162
No.
Yes.

14:27.231 --> 14:29.699
We seem to have
different approaches here.

14:29.701 --> 14:31.400
I was going
for helpful honesty.

14:31.402 --> 14:34.904
I have no idea
what you're doing.

14:34.906 --> 14:38.024
It's called being nice.

14:38.026 --> 14:39.375
Okay. If you think
being nice

14:39.377 --> 14:41.544
will get him to shut up,
I'll try it.

14:44.014 --> 14:46.799
You know what, guys? Never mind.
I just won't talk

14:46.801 --> 14:50.303
about the greatest achievement
of my life ever again.

14:50.305 --> 14:53.088
Look at that,
the problem solved itself.

14:59.696 --> 15:02.231
Hello, boys.

15:04.501 --> 15:07.453
What if we were to go

15:07.455 --> 15:10.106
as dinner table favorites
salt and pepper?

15:10.108 --> 15:12.992
You know salt makes me retain
water and my cousin William

15:12.994 --> 15:16.412
was ground to death
in a pepper factory accident.

15:18.114 --> 15:19.332
How about
Raggedy Ann and Andy?

15:19.334 --> 15:20.466
I loved them
growing up.

15:20.468 --> 15:21.751
No, I don't think so.

15:21.753 --> 15:24.286
Those dolls represent
three things I do not care for:

15:24.288 --> 15:26.956
clowns, children
and raggediness.

15:29.426 --> 15:30.960
I think it's a lost cause.

15:30.962 --> 15:34.463
No. There are certain things
that say to the world,

15:34.465 --> 15:36.866
"I have a boyfriend,
and he's not made up."

15:37.701 --> 15:39.301
Matching costumes,

15:39.303 --> 15:41.704
hickeys and sex tapes.

15:42.839 --> 15:44.807
Pick one.

15:44.809 --> 15:47.576
What's a hickey?

16:03.660 --> 16:05.294
How do I look?

16:05.296 --> 16:06.445
Fine.

16:06.447 --> 16:10.716
Uh-oh, is someone a little blue?

16:14.604 --> 16:16.772
Come on, Howie,
that's like the funniest thing

16:16.774 --> 16:18.975
I've ever said in my life.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.393
What do you say?
You ready to go?

16:20.395 --> 16:24.146
To tell you the truth,
I'm not really in the mood.

16:24.148 --> 16:25.398
What are you talking about?

16:25.400 --> 16:28.017
It'll be fun.
All your friends'll be there.

16:28.019 --> 16:30.185
Yeah, some friends.
They all think I'm boring.

16:30.187 --> 16:31.704
Maybe you should go
without me.

16:31.706 --> 16:34.156
No, if I'm there alone,
people might think

16:34.158 --> 16:37.893
I'm just a really short
person from <i>Avatar.</i>

16:37.895 --> 16:40.379
I'm sorry.
I just don't want to go.

16:40.381 --> 16:44.333
Hey, I just spent the last three
hours coloring myself blue.

16:44.335 --> 16:46.085
I'm gonna be
washing paint out

16:46.087 --> 16:48.220
of my Smurf for a month!

16:49.156 --> 16:51.223
Fine.

16:51.225 --> 16:53.259
Two weeks ago
I was an astronaut.

16:53.261 --> 16:55.811
Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf.
Keep walking.

16:58.381 --> 17:01.150
♪

17:01.152 --> 17:03.686
Oh, my God,
you guys look adorable!

17:03.688 --> 17:04.854
Thanks, so do you.

17:04.856 --> 17:06.672
Slutty cop?

17:06.674 --> 17:07.890
No, sexy cop.

17:07.892 --> 17:12.895
Slutty cop only came
with a skirt and two badges.

17:12.896 --> 17:14.696
And Albert Einstein?

17:14.699 --> 17:16.999

17:20.704 --> 17:23.455
I thought we said
in the car, no accents?

17:23.458 --> 17:25.790
Sorry, Officer.

17:29.496 --> 17:32.131
Hello!

17:33.967 --> 17:35.417
It's a great party!

17:35.419 --> 17:37.253
Thank you!

17:37.255 --> 17:41.223
The monster foods,
they're really fun.

17:41.225 --> 17:42.641
Oh, yes, thank you.

17:42.643 --> 17:46.028
I like to think of fun things
like that because I'm fun.

17:46.030 --> 17:49.648
I'm not clinically depressed
at all.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.867
Sheldon, get in here!

18:01.695 --> 18:04.497
I should've picked hickey.

18:04.499 --> 18:06.632
Hey, hey,
look at you guys!

18:06.634 --> 18:10.419
I'm Raggedy Ann, and
he's Raggedy C-3PO.

18:11.254 --> 18:14.123
It was a compromise.
I lost.

18:15.675 --> 18:17.760
Can you believe
Stuart's walking around

18:17.762 --> 18:19.261
taking credit
for this party?

18:19.263 --> 18:20.963
Who cares?

18:20.965 --> 18:23.099
What do you mean "who cares"?
Look at what I pulled off here.

18:23.101 --> 18:27.136
The deejay's on fire, there's
a Tardis photo booth in the back room,

18:27.138 --> 18:29.238
and, oh, my God, the food!

18:29.240 --> 18:32.224
Stuart wanted Kraft
Draculoni and cheese.

18:32.226 --> 18:34.276
You're right, the party's
fantastic. Please, tell me more.

18:34.278 --> 18:36.478
I haven't heard enough
about it all week

18:36.480 --> 18:38.647
because hearing about that
never gets old!

18:38.649 --> 18:40.232
Is this about the
space thing again?

18:40.234 --> 18:41.884
Well, I'm not allowed
to talk about it,

18:41.886 --> 18:44.670
but since you brought it up,
I went to space!

18:44.672 --> 18:47.406
Space, space, space!
Space, space, space!

18:47.408 --> 18:50.659
Whoa, Drinky Smurf.

18:51.545 --> 18:53.412
Can I talk to you
for a second?

18:53.414 --> 18:55.831
Great, now I'm in trouble.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.466
You happy?!

18:58.151 --> 19:00.136
You, out!

19:00.787 --> 19:03.439
You are being very rude!

19:03.441 --> 19:05.691
No, I'm not.
They're all being rude.

19:05.693 --> 19:06.742
And you're being rude.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.060
Me? What did I do?

19:08.062 --> 19:11.814
"Oh, Howie...

19:11.816 --> 19:14.900
"stop talking
about space so much.

19:14.902 --> 19:17.686
Nobody likes it."

19:17.688 --> 19:21.290
I don't sound like that.

19:22.976 --> 19:24.126
You're my wife.

19:24.128 --> 19:25.861
You're supposed
to be on my side.

19:25.863 --> 19:28.113
I'm always on your side.

19:28.115 --> 19:30.649
Then why are you trying
to take this away from me?

19:30.651 --> 19:32.918
Being an astronaut is

19:32.920 --> 19:37.039
the coolest thing
I'm ever gonna do.

19:37.041 --> 19:40.709
If I stop talking about it,
then I'm just...

19:40.711 --> 19:42.611
Just what?

19:42.613 --> 19:47.316
Just plain old
Howard Wolowitz again.

19:47.318 --> 19:51.570
Plain old Howard Wolowitz
is the best guy I know.

19:51.572 --> 19:53.239
You're just saying that.

19:53.241 --> 19:56.558
No, I'm not.
I married him.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.694
On purpose.

19:59.729 --> 20:01.563
Come here.

20:01.565 --> 20:02.898
I love you.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.566
I love you, too.

20:11.408 --> 20:14.627
Nothing to see here.
Just sexy police business.

20:16.213 --> 20:18.214
Just explaining
the theory of relativity.

20:18.965 --> 20:20.716
Twice.

20:29.505 --> 20:30.905
Hey, what you watching?

20:30.907 --> 20:31.541
I don't know.

20:31.542 --> 20:35.577
Raj sent me some video
of Buzz Aldrin.

20:36.121 --> 20:40.106
Here you go.
It's a Milky Way.

20:40.108 --> 20:44.510
The Milky Way's
a galaxy in space.

20:44.512 --> 20:46.679
I've been in space.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.352
Here's a Mars bar.

20:52.354 --> 20:54.020
I'm an astronaut.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.093
And this one's a Moon Pie.

21:01.095 --> 21:04.614
I walked on the Moon.

21:04.616 --> 21:06.766
What have you done?

21:10.533 --> 21:11.833
Okay, I get it.
