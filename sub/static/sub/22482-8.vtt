00:02.270 --> 00:03.804
Hi. Christy, alcoholic.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.573
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.508
I can't help thinking

00:07.541 --> 00:10.111
where I was Christmas
five years ago.

00:10.144 --> 00:14.048
I mean, I-I've really thought
about it and...

00:17.085 --> 00:19.187
I literally don't know
where I was.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.057
But if any of you were there,
maybe you could help me

00:23.091 --> 00:25.593
piece it together
or my deepest apology,

00:25.626 --> 00:27.528
whichever applies. Thanks.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.666
Hi, I'm Marjorie
and I'm an alcoholic.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.235
ALL:
Hi, Marjorie.

00:34.268 --> 00:38.572
This is a difficult holiday
with Victor being sick,

00:38.606 --> 00:41.075
and, uh,

00:41.109 --> 00:43.211
I know I need
to focus on him,

00:43.244 --> 00:45.313
so I'm sad to say

00:45.346 --> 00:48.649
that I won't be able to host my
annual Christmas cookie party.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.418
ALL: Aw.
Of course I'm
disappointed...

00:50.451 --> 00:53.621
Good thing we're in a meeting
so we can manage our grief.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.589
Shh.
Yeah, shh.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.395
I love this meeting.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.332
You ladies have really carried
me through the last few weeks,

01:04.365 --> 01:07.568
so to show my gratitude,
next week

01:07.601 --> 01:11.272
I am bringing my famous
nutty fruit log.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.407
ALL:
Yay.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.178
Would anyone else
like to share?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.547
Mary, alcoholic.
ALL: Hi, Mary.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.416
I'm afraid Mary
isn't very merry this year.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.518
It was recently brought
to my attention

01:24.552 --> 01:26.754
that my holiday letter
was a bit of a bummer.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.357
: I don't think
we got one.
We did.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.526
That's why the table
doesn't wobble anymore.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.630
I understand telling everyone
that my daughter was in jail,

01:36.664 --> 01:40.368
that my brother got evicted,
and that my pink eye came back,

01:40.401 --> 01:43.804
was not exactly holiday cheer,
but it is what happened,

01:43.837 --> 01:45.673
and I did make it rhyme.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.577
Thanks for letting me share.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.612
I know you all care.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.749
Okay.
Okay, my turn.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.218
Bonnie, alcoholic.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.586
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.355
Everybody always shares about
how hard it is

02:01.389 --> 02:03.924
around the Christmas holiday.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.361
And to them I say, ba-bam!

02:12.833 --> 02:14.268
That's all I got.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.737
Merry Christmas.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.706
*

02:34.955 --> 02:37.591
Ugh. Wow.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.694
Look what happy people do
for the holidays.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.597
Please. They're obviously
overcompensating.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.833
You see Christmas cheer,
I see a miserable couple

02:45.866 --> 02:48.269
on the brink of divorce.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.238
You get all that
from the front door?

02:50.271 --> 02:52.673
And I read their mail.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.411
Did you leave
the light on?

02:57.445 --> 03:00.781
Oh, my God,
we've been robbed.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.883
Of what?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.885
We don't have anything.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.420
My laptop.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.921
Oh, damn it, I left my
watch on the nightstand.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.691
Oh. Ah.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.429
Was that you?
No. I was in back.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.898
Oh, my God! That means
they were still in here.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.567
Get out, get out, get out!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.635
That means they're
out here now.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.771
Get in, get in, get in!

03:30.511 --> 03:32.880
Looks like he got in
through the bedroom window.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.283
He? It could've been a woman.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.785
Sure.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.588
You might want to get
that window fixed.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.323
I'll tell the building manager.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.392
I'm sure she'll get to it
in a few months.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.728
Is now really the time?

03:47.761 --> 03:50.531
Here is a list
of the missing items.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.799
Hmm.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.268
Is there any chance you're
gonna find our stuff?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.869
You want hope or the truth?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.672
I've never had either.
I just want my laptop.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.909
Sure.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.845
Thanks, officers.
Yeah.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.583
I don't get the feeling we're
the cold case those two

04:09.617 --> 04:11.051
are gonna carry to their graves.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.422
I had a term paper
on that computer

04:14.455 --> 04:15.823
and it's my entire grade.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.024
Did you back it up?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.427
If I had backed it up, would
I be freaking out right now?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.462
Maybe. You run pretty hot.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.297
Now I'm gonna fail that class,
and then

04:23.331 --> 04:25.032
I won't graduate, and then
I won't get into law school

04:25.065 --> 04:26.734
and all this hard work
will have been for nothing,

04:26.767 --> 04:29.570
and I might as well just
stick my head in the oven.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.472
Well, if that's the plan,
kitchen's over there.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.341
That's it?

04:33.374 --> 04:34.842
You're not gonna talk me down?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.877
Excuse me, but there are
two victims here.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.046
That worthless punk
stole my watch.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.748
Oop, no.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.750
Here it is.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.754
Hmm. Looks like they didn't
touch Roscoe's stuff.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.758
Baseball cards,
paintball gun.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.828
Hey, maybe we should consider
getting a real gun.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.497
Are you serious?

04:56.530 --> 04:58.732
Yeah, we're adults.
We know what to...

04:58.766 --> 05:00.033
Ow!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.040
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.842
It was not an accident!

05:08.876 --> 05:11.379
Oh, come on,
why would I shoot you?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.046
Why wouldn't you shoot me?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.748
Go get a towel.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.519
Ow!

05:18.552 --> 05:20.688
Still want to get a real gun?

05:28.562 --> 05:32.400
Are you planning on sleeping
with the lights on?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.968
I don't plan on
sleeping at all.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.939
It just creeps me out
some stranger was in our home.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.608
:
Yeah.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.043
I mean, for all we know,
he could have come up here

05:43.076 --> 05:45.846
and rubbed his ugly
naked butt on your pillow.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.585
Why would you say that?

05:51.619 --> 05:53.554
Oh, come on, we're
both thinkin' it.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.989
No, I really wasn't.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.024
You are now.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.595
Hey!

06:02.963 --> 06:05.098
What was that?

06:06.734 --> 06:07.868
Sounds like
the water heater.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.603
How could it be
the water heater?

06:09.637 --> 06:11.004
The water heater
doesn't work.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.741
Maybe the burglar broke in
and he's fixing it.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.609
Well, at least
somebody is.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.844
I told you, it's on my list.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.580
I'm waiting for parts.
I'm waiting for parts.
Well, I am.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.082
Just turn off the light
and go to bed.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.894
Hmm?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.800
I broke into
a house once.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.905
What?

06:44.938 --> 06:47.508
Yep.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.877
I needed money for drugs.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.513
I cased a couple of houses.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.782
I saw one where the mail
was stacked up.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.718
I went around back
and broke a window.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.653
Wow.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.055
That's a straight-up felony.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.526
Only if you get caught.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.795
It was the one
time I really,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.663
you know,
crossed the line.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.799
The one time?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.167
I mean, I did what
normal people do.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.937
You know, go to a party,
raid the medicine cabinet,

07:16.970 --> 07:18.839
rifle through the jackets
on the bed,

07:18.872 --> 07:21.675
take an outfit out of
the closet, wear it home.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.577
Who does that?

07:23.611 --> 07:25.846
You might not want to hear this,

07:25.879 --> 07:28.849
but that's what you were doing
Christmas five years ago.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.488
I can't believe you
broke into somebody's house.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.057
Me neither. God...

07:37.090 --> 07:41.962
I never thought about what I put
those people through until now.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.866
Just curious,
what'd you steal?

07:45.899 --> 07:49.637
Mmm. Cash, jewelry, an EpiPen.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.606
I hope the kid didn't
eat peanuts the next day.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.009
That's what
those are for?

07:56.043 --> 07:58.912
Oh. It just
made me run fast.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.017
Sounds awful.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.986
I'm sorry you
went through that.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.656
Yeah. I'm still pretty
shaken up.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.023
You should get a dog.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.191
No, thanks.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.061
My mom's barely housebroken.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.863
How about a cat?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.566
A security cat?

08:18.599 --> 08:21.168
Mine freak out when a stranger
comes to the door.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.904
You should see
my mailman's ankles.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.608
Well, I did put up
some cheap webcams.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.109
Check it out.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.112
Living room... kitchen.
Mm-hmm.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.214
Yep. There's Bonnie.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.887
CHRISTY:
Look at her.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.122
I live with Homer Simpson.

08:42.155 --> 08:47.060
Wait, why is she going through
my laundry?

08:47.094 --> 08:51.331
Better question, why is she
taking off her sweatpants?

08:51.364 --> 08:54.001
That's my underwear.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.004
She's putting on my underwear.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.941
Oh, my God. That's why
all my thongs are stretched out.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.077
Strange butts in my underwear,

09:04.111 --> 09:06.780
strange butts on my pillow.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.182
Will this nightmare never end?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.684
WENDY:
Hold on.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.685
Christy, I think

09:11.719 --> 09:13.821
I found your laptop.
What?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.288
Someone just posted it
on craigslist,

09:15.322 --> 09:18.325
and it has that lame "Follow
your dreams" sticker on it.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.227
Oh, my God. This is it.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.729
Ha.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.030
How did you know to look there?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.734
A lot of people sell
stolen stuff online.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.204
Or so I've heard.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.143
Unbelievable.
They want $300 for it.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.879
The "Z"
doesn't even work.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.615
You wrote an entire
term paper without a "Z"?

09:41.649 --> 09:42.883
That's amazing.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.819
No. That's astonishing,

09:45.853 --> 09:48.588
incredible or jaw-dropping.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.967
Why so squirmy?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.335
It's almost like your underwear
is the wrong size.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.037
What's it to you?

10:04.071 --> 10:06.740
I saw you take mine
on the spycam.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.009
That is such a violation
of my privacy.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.178
You can't say that
in my panties.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.847
I hate to interrupt,

10:13.881 --> 10:15.348
but I think that's
the building.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.252
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

10:19.286 --> 10:23.056
What? Four middle-aged women
waltzing into a crime scene?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.858
What are we
supposed to do?

10:24.892 --> 10:26.694
The cops won't even
return my phone calls.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.429
Well, in their defense,
you left super long messages.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.031
Well, screw them.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.233
I'm gonna go get my laptop back.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.203
I'm not sure-- this is
a pretty dicey part of town.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.306
Oh, come on. We've all been
in worse neighborhoods than this

10:39.339 --> 10:40.741
to buy drugs.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.876
Or to sell drugs.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.978
Or just hoping
to meet someone.

10:48.281 --> 10:52.252
Come on, ladies,
let's hit the bricks!

10:57.891 --> 11:00.160
Why is no one
hittin' the bricks?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.364
Really, Mom?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.200
I have a diamond ring
to protect now.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.370
But your kid, your
kid you can lose?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.706
I'm sorry, what?

11:16.443 --> 11:19.046
Did this guy sound
dangerous on the phone?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.814
We only e-mailed,

11:20.848 --> 11:22.315
just the time and place.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.985
Okay, someone's got
to go in first.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.686
Who's the most expendable?

11:28.188 --> 11:31.124
Are you all staring at me
so I'll say Wendy?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.459
Just knock.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.030
What if he lured us here
so he can rob us again?

11:37.064 --> 11:39.466
Well, you wanted
to meet somebody.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.904
Oh, hello, girls.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.939
What are you all
doing here?

11:46.974 --> 11:48.341
Uh...

11:48.375 --> 11:51.211
* God rest ye merry gentlemen

11:51.244 --> 11:53.480
ALL:
* Let nothing you dismay

11:53.513 --> 11:56.183
Oh...
* Remember Christ
our Savior *

11:56.216 --> 11:57.450
* Was born on Christmas Day...

12:01.388 --> 12:05.425
* Two turtle doves, and
a partridge in a pear tree. *

12:07.160 --> 12:08.896
What a treat!

12:08.929 --> 12:12.866
Oh, thank you for coming and
bringing some Christmas cheer.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.167
How about

12:14.201 --> 12:16.770
if I make us all
a cup of hot cocoa?

12:16.804 --> 12:18.138
That'd be great, Mare.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.408
That bitch stole our stuff.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.144
This doesn't make any sense--
it couldn't have been her.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.781
Is it just me, or did we
sound really good caroling?

12:27.815 --> 12:29.082
Will you focus?

12:29.116 --> 12:31.184
We're dealing
with a criminal mastermind.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.820
Tiny marshmallows all around?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.955
Lovely.
Mary, wait a minute.

12:34.988 --> 12:39.927
Actually, we're here because
of a very strange situation.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.462
Christy and Bonnie got robbed.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.498
Oh, no.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.101
Is there anything
I can do to help?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.402
Actually, there might be.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.973
We tracked down my stolen laptop
to this address.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.108
I don't understand.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.144
Where you hiding the loot,
old woman?
Mom.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.480
I'm sorry, did you want
to be bad cop?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.415
Of course
we don't think it's you.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.052
Uh... does anyone else
live here?

13:05.085 --> 13:08.021
:
Oh, just my grandson, Todd.

13:08.055 --> 13:12.192
On Law & Order this is when we
would exchange a knowing look.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.994
Oh, no, not my Todd.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.595
He's always been a good boy.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.131
I'm sure he has.
Can some of us comfort you

13:18.165 --> 13:20.868
while the rest of us
search his room?
No!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.069
He would never steal.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.171
He's studying to be
an electrician.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.473
All I know is that someone
gave me this address

13:26.506 --> 13:29.076
to come over
and buy my computer back.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.612
No one's judging
you, Mary.
Of course not.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.283
We're judging your
thief/electrician grandson.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.253
I think that you should leave.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.124
Just her,
or all of us?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.626
Mare, maybe he lost his way
a little.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.996
You don't know
what you're talking about.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.563
Just get out.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.034
Okay, ladies, let's go.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.269
Wait. We're just leaving?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.105
Yes, you're leaving.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.540
Fine. But we'll be back.

14:00.573 --> 14:04.111
Probably. I mean, we haven't
talked about a plan yet...

14:05.012 --> 14:06.947
Um, Mary,

14:06.980 --> 14:08.481
if you do find
the computer,

14:08.515 --> 14:11.218
could you please
print out my paper?!

14:14.021 --> 14:16.056
Do you think Mary'll
show up tonight?

14:16.089 --> 14:19.392
Well, if she doesn't, I hope
she finds another meeting,

14:19.426 --> 14:21.161
because the most important thing

14:21.194 --> 14:24.898
is that she works the program so
she can maintain her sobriety.

14:24.932 --> 14:29.602
Let me ask you something--
and this is 100% sincere.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.872
Have you ever put yourself
to sleep while you were talking?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.613
Hey. Turns out we weren't
the only ones who got hit.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.150
Laura was robbed while
she was at a meeting, too.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.684
How weird is that?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.386
It's not weird at all.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.056
This kid hangs around his
grandmother's meetings,

14:49.089 --> 14:50.490
so he can follow
people home,

14:50.523 --> 14:53.326
so he can rob them the
next time they're here.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.962
That's awful.

14:54.995 --> 14:55.963
It's also pretty smart.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.966
But mainly awful.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.567
MARY:
Christy?

15:02.169 --> 15:04.404
Oh, good. You came.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.040
I didn't want
to believe you, but...

15:07.074 --> 15:09.276
I went into Todd's room.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.646
I hope this is everything.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.118
My computer.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.452
Thank you, Mary.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.554
Are you gonna call the police?

15:21.588 --> 15:25.025
That wouldn't help anyone.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.232
Wait. Mary, aren't you staying
for the meeting?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.269
Not today.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.305
But we'll see you next week?

15:40.007 --> 15:41.641
Maybe.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.079
Uh, what should we do?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.380
:
I don't know.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.649
Maybe just give her some time.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.386
Boy, it's just so sad.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.555
I know. Poor Mary.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.992
No. I mean, everything we
own that's worth stealing

15:59.026 --> 16:01.561
fits in one bag.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.398
This is
a Christmas miracle.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.100
Your paper's
still there?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.501
Yeah.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.638
I remember my opening paragraph
being a little snappier.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.474
You think there's a chance
that kid might have...

16:14.507 --> 16:17.044
Stolen your computer,
broken into your documents

16:17.077 --> 16:18.511
and rewrote your homework?

16:18.545 --> 16:21.014
So you're not ruling it out?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.319
Huh. What's this?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.588
Gold earrings.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.224
He must have stolen these
from someone else.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.126
No, those are ours.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.395
They are not.
Yes, they are.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.431
After how bad we felt
getting robbed,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.267
you want to do
the same thing?

16:40.300 --> 16:43.436
You're unbelievable.
I feel ashamed that I know you.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.172
They're my Christmas present
to you.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.141
Oh, my God, Mom,
they're so nice!

16:48.175 --> 16:50.443
Why didn't you stop me
from saying all that?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.811
I feel terrible.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.114
And that's my Christmas present
from you.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.754
Mary? It's Christy.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.690
What about me?

17:03.723 --> 17:07.327
Let's let you be
a delightful surprise.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.462
MARY:
Please go away.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.765
Come on, Mary,
open the door.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.571
What do you want?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.507
We were worried about you.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.642
We haven't seen you in a week.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.081
What happened to
your Christmas tree?

17:28.115 --> 17:31.418
I didn't feel like
celebrating this year.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.189
How are things
with your grandson?

17:36.223 --> 17:38.325
Not good. He took off.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.593
I'm really worried
about him.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.499
Todd was always
my little shining star.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.503
I know this is hard,

17:50.537 --> 17:53.173
but you can't stop
coming to meetings.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.375
Oh. I'm too embarrassed.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.377
In front of us?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.412
Have you listened
to our shares?

17:59.446 --> 18:00.880
We're all train wrecks.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.683
Speak for yourself--
I have a fiancé.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.586
I'm not sure what
the point is anymore.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.124
Mary... you didn't get
sober for your grandson.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
You got sober
for yourself.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.296
And you can't help him
unless you stay that way.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.497
Don't write the kid off.

18:17.530 --> 18:22.202
Sometimes disappointing children
grow up and surprise you.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.205
I'd take a shot back, but
I really love my earrings.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.476
How about we have a
meeting right now?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.613
I'd like that.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.682
You want to start?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.519
Hi. I'm Mary.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.224
And I'm an alcoholic.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.493
Hi, Mary.
Hi, Mary.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.168
Excuse me.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.669
Yes?

18:56.703 --> 18:59.572
You don't know me, but...
do you have a minute?

18:59.606 --> 19:03.243
Sorry, I already picked my God,
and I've got enough magazines.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.745
Both good guesses,
but not why I'm here.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.548
Did you live here
nine years ago?

19:08.581 --> 19:12.219
Yes. Why?

19:12.252 --> 19:13.920
Okay, here goes.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.422
Um...

19:15.455 --> 19:18.725
I kind of...

19:18.758 --> 19:21.761
broke into your house
and robbed you.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.630
What

19:23.663 --> 19:25.565
Yeah. I-I...

19:25.598 --> 19:28.235
came to make an amends to you.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.469
An amends?

19:29.502 --> 19:33.773
See, back when I robbed you,
I was a drunk and a drug addict.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.777
And I-I know that's
not an excuse, but it is,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.379
sort of, my excuse.

19:39.412 --> 19:43.550
What I did was terrible,
and I'm sorry if I made you feel

19:43.583 --> 19:45.752
you weren't safe
in your own home.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.755
My kids couldn't sleep
for weeks.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.558
I know I can't make up
for what I did,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.360
but I'd be happy
to write a check

19:53.393 --> 19:55.962
for whatever you feel
covers what I took.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.665
Okay, $1,200.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.602
$1,200
Isn't that kind of high?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.904
Do you want to make
this right, or not?

20:04.937 --> 20:08.541
I only have $900
in my bank account.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.843
Okay, give me that.

20:10.877 --> 20:11.944
Wow.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.946
I was kind of hoping

20:13.980 --> 20:16.616
we were gonna end up
just hugging this thing out,

20:16.649 --> 20:18.751
but... okay.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.354
Do you need a pen?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.823
I got one.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.525
Did you steal it?

20:25.558 --> 20:26.893
I did not.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.730
Last chance to say $500.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.766
Okay, yeah...

20:33.800 --> 20:37.304
I'm just gonna write
"Merry Christmas" in the memo.
