03:20.180 --> 03:21.500
- Yes, please.
- Paaa!

03:24.300 --> 03:25.780
Oh.

03:29.060 --> 03:30.780

04:53.860 --> 04:56.540
Hmm. Now I just
want to maybe...

05:07.420 --> 05:08.780
There we go.

05:08.860 --> 05:11.100
Ha ha! Ta-da!

05:13.500 --> 05:14.940
Oh, thank you.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.380
Oh!

06:01.820 --> 06:03.540
Here we go!

06:03.620 --> 06:05.380
Come on, come on.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.900
Come on, you!

06:09.580 --> 06:10.540
Huh?!

06:10.620 --> 06:13.020
Oh, that stupid...

06:14.900 --> 06:16.260
You come here.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.220
You are such a naughty puss!

06:21.300 --> 06:22.780
Give that to me,

06:22.860 --> 06:25.380

06:27.660 --> 06:29.060
Oh.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.740

Well?

06:44.260 --> 06:45.500
Sorry.

06:45.580 --> 06:46.660
Oh.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.540
Ah.

06:51.660 --> 06:53.340
The plan is this:

06:53.420 --> 06:55.380
Scrapper goes in there.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.980
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.900
Here. Worms.

07:00.980 --> 07:05.060
The mole will follow the worms,

07:05.140 --> 07:07.340
up the steps like this...

07:11.260 --> 07:13.740
...and the mole will go up,

07:13.820 --> 07:15.500
reach for the worm,

07:15.580 --> 07:17.020
and fall in.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.260
What do you think?

07:18.340 --> 07:19.660
- Yes.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.180
Oh?

08:02.020 --> 08:03.540
Oh!

08:06.540 --> 08:08.180
Ahem.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.580
Now.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.180
- Oh!
- Do it.

08:11.260 --> 08:13.260
No, no.

08:13.340 --> 08:17.020
No, I don't--
No, I don't--I--oh.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.580

- Oh. Oh.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.780
There.

09:08.420 --> 09:09.860
There.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.300
Hmm?

09:22.380 --> 09:23.860
Hello.

09:30.540 --> 09:32.460
Come on.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.340
Ohh!

09:42.420 --> 09:44.700
That's it. Come.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.060
Yippee! Yippee!

09:52.780 --> 09:54.500
Here we are.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.260
Okay?

10:01.940 --> 10:03.100
Bye-bye.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.380

Hmm.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.140
Oh. I know.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.020
Here we are.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.100
And this can be the roof.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.420
There.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.780
All right.

10:24.860 --> 10:26.100
Bye-bye.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.540
Huh?

10:30.620 --> 10:32.260
You want the book back?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.580
Oh, all right.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.700
Stay there.
