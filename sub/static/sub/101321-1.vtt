[eerie ambient music]

02:29.390 --> 02:31.012
- [Lilith] I can't
believe you're doing this.

02:32.393 --> 02:35.396
He's barely in the
ground, and you're taking

02:35.431 --> 02:38.675
away the one thing
he holds most dear.

02:40.539 --> 02:43.093
- [Emma] It's not like you're
giving me much of a choice.

02:44.302 --> 02:47.960
- You haven't even seen
her since she was born.

02:47.995 --> 02:52.275
You are unfit to
be anyone's mother.

02:52.310 --> 02:53.690
- The judge says otherwise.

02:53.725 --> 02:55.934
- The judge is an idiot.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.770
There must be
something I can do.

03:04.805 --> 03:08.809
- As they were still married
at the time of his death,

03:08.843 --> 03:12.675
uh, the transfer of
assets is settled.

03:14.124 --> 03:17.058
The ruling also approves
full custodial guardianship

03:17.093 --> 03:22.063
of Isla, as long as Emma
abides by the court mandates.

03:24.411 --> 03:26.482
I, I'm sorry, Mrs. Walker.

03:36.561 --> 03:39.840
- I want you to know
how much I love you.

03:57.927 --> 03:58.721
- Hi.

04:11.492 --> 04:15.151
[dramatic orchestral music]

04:53.776 --> 04:55.847
I know it's gonna be
a big change for you,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.368
but it's gonna be a
big change for me too.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.371
And I want us to get along.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.971
I expected the place to
have changed a lot more.

Check it out!

06:17.515 --> 06:18.930
Our new house!

06:18.964 --> 06:21.035
[laughs]

06:22.209 --> 06:23.003
Babe, come up!

06:23.037 --> 06:23.831
Come up here!

06:23.866 --> 06:25.074
See this view?

06:25.108 --> 06:26.109
This is us.

06:34.566 --> 06:35.395
Isla?

06:40.123 --> 06:41.918
I left some dinner
outside your room.

07:37.215 --> 07:38.009
- It's okay!

07:38.043 --> 07:38.872
It's okay!

07:38.906 --> 07:39.700
You stay here, okay?

07:39.735 --> 07:41.322
It's gonna be fine.

07:58.581 --> 07:59.789
I'll be right back, okay?

[ominous orchestral music]

09:17.349 --> 09:20.560
Hey, it's nothing, I probably
just forgot to close it.

09:28.015 --> 09:28.844
See?

09:34.021 --> 09:35.298
It's just the two of us.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.928
Hello!

09:43.962 --> 09:45.136
Is anyone here?

09:48.311 --> 09:49.140
See?

09:57.631 --> 10:02.463
[creaking]
[wind howling]

10:15.545 --> 10:18.376
- There she is,
there's my homegirl.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.377
[laughs]

10:19.411 --> 10:20.861
- Oh, Ashley.

10:20.896 --> 10:22.138
- Hi.

10:22.173 --> 10:24.693
So, where's my special niece?

10:24.727 --> 10:26.971
- You know, she's
on a hunger strike,

10:27.005 --> 10:28.731
barely said a word to me.

10:28.766 --> 10:30.250
- Ah, that bad, huh?

10:30.284 --> 10:32.252
Mm, she'll come around,
just give it time.

10:32.286 --> 10:34.150
- Yeah, sure?

10:34.185 --> 10:35.565
- Of course.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.394
You're her mother.

10:39.052 --> 10:40.916
- [Emma] Mark, what
are you doing here?

10:42.538 --> 10:44.057
- I heard about what happened.

10:44.091 --> 10:46.024
I just want to express
my condolences.

10:48.889 --> 10:49.959
If you ever need
anyone to talk to

10:49.994 --> 10:51.927
or just looking for a friend.

10:53.963 --> 10:55.137
- Great, thanks.

11:00.832 --> 11:02.972
- Well, that was a
blast from the past.

11:04.180 --> 11:05.975
- Yeah.

11:06.010 --> 11:07.080
Think she'll like them?

11:07.114 --> 11:08.322
- Yeah.

11:08.357 --> 11:09.703
Yeah, she'll like
them, they look good.

11:09.738 --> 11:11.118
What was up with Mark today?

11:12.016 --> 11:13.465
- I don't wanna talk about it.

11:16.537 --> 11:19.023
Found some pancake
mix in the cupboard.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.818
Figured they might
be your favorite.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.968
Hope you like 'em.

11:41.148 --> 11:42.702
- [Isla] Thank you.

11:49.881 --> 11:50.813
- What if it's too soon.

11:50.848 --> 11:52.194
What if she hates me for it?

11:55.887 --> 11:58.131
- Why don't we start
with the little things?

11:58.165 --> 11:59.684
Keep the photos of Patrick,

11:59.719 --> 12:02.273
but as for the
rest of this stuff,

12:02.307 --> 12:04.378
I mean, especially your room,

12:04.413 --> 12:06.070
no point in feeling
like a stranger

12:06.104 --> 12:07.071
in your own home.

12:07.105 --> 12:08.693
- My home?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.419
- This is your
home now, isn't it?

12:13.077 --> 12:16.736
[dramatic orchestral music]

12:20.256 --> 12:22.396
- Patrick had so many
plans for this place.

12:23.846 --> 12:26.504
He wanted to build a white
picket fence over there.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.643
Just never got to it.

12:27.677 --> 12:28.575
- Yeah, no shit.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.924
- Isla,

12:32.959 --> 12:34.650
don't go in there.

12:34.684 --> 12:36.100
- Em, she's just a kid.

12:41.830 --> 12:43.107
Hey, so I gotta bounce.

12:43.141 --> 12:44.522
My shift starts in like an hour.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.454
- Mm.

12:45.488 --> 12:46.282
Thanks for your help today.

12:46.317 --> 12:47.663
- Yeah, of course.

12:47.697 --> 12:48.491
Hey.

12:48.526 --> 12:49.527
See you later, kiddo!

12:50.977 --> 12:52.254
- [Emma] Do you need a ride?

12:52.288 --> 12:53.082
- I'm good.

12:57.638 --> 13:00.710
[eerie ambient music]

13:10.997 --> 13:12.446
- First table meal together.

13:14.759 --> 13:16.312
Figured this would be
a great time for us

13:16.347 --> 13:17.658
to get to know each other.

13:21.731 --> 13:23.388
You know dinner tables
are a special place

13:23.423 --> 13:25.943
for people to talk
about their day and,

13:28.186 --> 13:29.222
how do you feel?

13:30.602 --> 13:31.500
- I feel hungry.

13:32.950 --> 13:34.710
- I meant how do you
feel about things so far,

13:34.744 --> 13:39.715
I, you know, I thought
it'd be good for us

13:40.820 --> 13:41.821
to lay out our
thoughts and stuff.

13:47.309 --> 13:49.621
- I saw something moving
in one of the windows.

13:50.933 --> 13:52.279
- Oh yeah?

13:52.314 --> 13:53.142
What did you see?

14:00.494 --> 14:03.670
[eerie ambient music]

14:06.500 --> 14:08.123
Bedroom's clear.

14:08.157 --> 14:10.608
[grunts lightly]

14:10.642 --> 14:12.299
You know what my
mom once told me?

14:13.335 --> 14:14.784
That there are no bad ghosts.

14:16.234 --> 14:18.754
Just ones that are lost
and need a place to stay.

14:18.788 --> 14:20.825
And sometimes, when
it's rainy and windy,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.240
that's when you hear 'em.

14:23.759 --> 14:26.037
And this house has enough
room for all of us.

14:27.245 --> 14:29.040
So there's nothing
to be afraid of.

14:34.045 --> 14:35.357
Goodnight, Isla.

15:15.466 --> 15:19.090
[dramatic orchestral music]

15:28.651 --> 15:31.551
[light clattering]

16:12.109 --> 16:14.076
[yelps]

16:15.802 --> 16:16.976
- [Isla] Emma?

16:18.494 --> 16:21.773
[dramatic piano music]

16:26.330 --> 16:29.816
- It's okay, it
happens sometimes when
you have nightmares.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.300
- It wasn't a nightmare.

16:31.335 --> 16:34.476
[eerie ambient music]

16:39.377 --> 16:40.413
- What is it?

16:50.250 --> 16:51.148
- No don't!

16:57.568 --> 16:58.396
- [Emma] See?

17:04.126 --> 17:05.576
It's nothing to be scared of.

17:07.371 --> 17:10.339
[crickets chirping]

17:19.279 --> 17:20.453
- [Dr. Henderson] I'm concerned

17:20.487 --> 17:21.833
about her signs of aggression.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.042
- I don't, I won't.

17:25.215 --> 17:26.114
- [Dr. Henderson]
It must've been hard

17:26.147 --> 17:27.770
for you to hear about Patrick.

17:27.805 --> 17:28.840
What happened to him.

17:30.187 --> 17:31.705
Did attending the funeral help?

17:33.190 --> 17:36.710
- I don't know, I,
I feel like there's

17:36.745 --> 17:41.715
so much more I wanted to say
to him, and now I, I can't.

17:42.475 --> 17:43.579
- Letting go is hard,

17:43.614 --> 17:45.512
and with Isla
reentering your life-

17:45.547 --> 17:47.928
- I know, but I won't make
the same mistakes again,

17:47.963 --> 17:51.967
I, the two of us are
already making progress.

17:55.004 --> 17:57.731
I really appreciate
these sessions with you.

17:57.766 --> 17:59.181
- The judge placed a great deal

17:59.216 --> 18:00.527
of trust in this arrangement.

18:00.562 --> 18:02.150
It's important for
you to be honest.

18:02.184 --> 18:04.531
- I will, I, I'm tryin' to-

18:04.566 --> 18:06.361
[computer whirring]

18:06.395 --> 18:07.224
Doctor?

18:18.752 --> 18:20.720
[sighs]

18:20.754 --> 18:24.448
[dramatic orchestral music]

18:53.753 --> 18:56.135
- I saw you at dad's funeral.

18:59.448 --> 19:00.208
- You did?

19:02.865 --> 19:03.694
Come here.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.732
- You were sitting by yourself.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.431
- I know I wasn't
supposed to be there, but

19:18.709 --> 19:19.710
I had to see him.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.338
- You miss him, don't you?

19:29.064 --> 19:29.892
- Yeah.

19:31.515 --> 19:32.930
More than you can imagine.

19:32.964 --> 19:36.623
[dramatic orchestral music]

19:38.177 --> 19:39.557
- I miss him too.

19:40.524 --> 19:41.352
- I know.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.841
[inhales deeply]

19:52.087 --> 19:53.192
- Mr. Nibbles!

19:53.226 --> 19:55.366
[kissing]

20:03.167 --> 20:04.858
Ya see, see, Mr. Nibbles!

20:04.893 --> 20:05.721
[sighs]

20:05.756 --> 20:07.447
- Mrs. Willis?

20:07.482 --> 20:08.759
Remember me?

20:08.793 --> 20:09.587
It's Emma.

20:11.313 --> 20:12.728
You know Mr. Nibbles
seems to be, uh,

20:12.763 --> 20:14.247
leaving some treats
on my doorstep.

20:14.282 --> 20:15.179
You don't suppose he-

20:15.214 --> 20:16.318
- [Mrs. Willis] Mr. Nibbles!

20:18.700 --> 20:19.528
- Great.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.153
[sighs]

20:25.914 --> 20:28.572
[flies buzzing]

20:35.579 --> 20:37.305
Two juice boxes should
last you the day.

20:37.339 --> 20:40.584
There's five bucks for
lunch, and I think,

20:40.618 --> 20:41.861
think you're good to go.

20:43.518 --> 20:44.967
Oh, I've got something for ya.

20:46.521 --> 20:49.317
You're a big girl now,
so, this bad boy used

20:49.351 --> 20:51.215
to be my pride and
joy in college.

20:53.148 --> 20:54.322
Only use it for emergencies.

20:54.356 --> 20:55.909
I've already keyed in my number.

20:57.463 --> 20:59.050
Well, how 'bout it?

20:59.085 --> 21:00.086
Your first cell phone.

21:03.192 --> 21:05.505
- The other kids can
watch movies on theirs.

21:09.060 --> 21:09.889
- Right.

21:14.928 --> 21:18.587
[dramatic orchestral music]

21:41.990 --> 21:44.613
[phone buzzing]

21:52.759 --> 21:54.416
Hey I'm so, so sorry.

21:54.451 --> 21:55.624
I got held up at work.

21:59.973 --> 22:00.802
Here.

22:02.597 --> 22:03.391
I'm sorry.

22:08.775 --> 22:10.398
- [Isla] What are we doing here?

22:10.432 --> 22:11.606
- Do you like ice cream?

22:15.230 --> 22:18.198
There's this really cool place
I used to go to all the time.

22:18.233 --> 22:19.717
- [Mark] I thought I
recognized that voice.

22:20.684 --> 22:22.030
- Mark.

22:22.064 --> 22:23.549
What're you doing here?

22:23.583 --> 22:24.757
- I just work up the street.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.448
I was, uh, on my way
to lunch and I saw you.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.071
Hey, little lady.

22:29.106 --> 22:29.865
I'm Mark.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.832
What's your name?

22:30.866 --> 22:31.798
- Isla.

22:31.833 --> 22:32.972
- [Mark] You know your mom and I

22:33.006 --> 22:33.869
used to come here all the time.

22:33.904 --> 22:35.423
- So you, uh, working now?

22:35.457 --> 22:36.941
- Yeah, yeah.

22:36.976 --> 22:38.702
They actually, uh, made
me the senior tech advisor

22:38.736 --> 22:40.842
at the store on Second Street.

22:40.876 --> 22:42.326
The store manager said
it was the fastest

22:42.361 --> 22:44.293
they've ever promoted someone.

22:44.328 --> 22:45.916
- That's great news.

22:45.950 --> 22:48.746
- You know, I was thinkin'
about Patrick's death,

22:50.265 --> 22:53.164
and it really made me
consider my past actions.

22:53.199 --> 22:55.339
I think I'm makin'
really good progress now.

22:57.306 --> 22:58.100
- That's great.

22:59.895 --> 23:01.276
I'm really happy for you.

23:02.519 --> 23:04.866
I, I really gotta
get going, sorry.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.350
- Oh, of course, of course.

23:09.767 --> 23:10.768
Bye.

23:10.803 --> 23:11.873
It's nice meeting you.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.368
- Who was that?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.095
- [Emma] That's, it's nobody.

23:29.822 --> 23:31.582
- [Isla] I thought we
were getting ice cream.

23:31.617 --> 23:33.722
- Let's get ice
cream somewhere else.

23:35.241 --> 23:37.554
[Isla hums]

23:55.813 --> 23:57.436
Is that Mr. Nibbles?

23:58.885 --> 24:01.163
You know he was around
when I used to live here.

24:02.337 --> 24:04.132
I can't believe
he's still alive.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.444
- You like cats, too?

24:05.478 --> 24:08.170
- Well, let's just say
that that's the only cat

24:08.205 --> 24:09.378
I'm not allergic to.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.727
[bell ringing]
[cat meowing]

24:12.761 --> 24:13.555
Until now.

24:15.005 --> 24:18.457
And like all cats, this
thing has a mind of its own.

24:25.774 --> 24:27.224
You know, you're pretty good.

28:01.645 --> 28:03.647
Isla, what're you doing?

28:06.063 --> 28:10.412
- I lost the ring.

28:10.447 --> 28:11.241
- You lost the ring?

28:11.275 --> 28:13.484
What, oh, no, no, no.

28:19.145 --> 28:20.215
Why would you do that?

28:21.216 --> 28:22.942
- I was just looking.

28:22.977 --> 28:23.771
Are you mad?

28:24.875 --> 28:25.704
- Dinner's ready.

28:26.774 --> 28:29.224
- [Isla] I'm not hungry.

28:29.259 --> 28:30.812
- Well, you gotta eat something.

28:33.539 --> 28:34.713

to our future children?

29:19.033 --> 29:22.346
- Um, you're gonna
be an amazing dad.

29:23.244 --> 29:24.210

it's just a lost ghost.

31:37.826 --> 31:39.587
- Isla what're you doing?

31:39.621 --> 31:41.520

God, you scared me.

31:59.814 --> 32:02.472
I'm sorry about before,
I swear I wasn't mad.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.683
But what you did in the kitchen,
you could've hurt yourself.

32:06.717 --> 32:07.546
All right?

32:10.790 --> 32:12.861
[dramatic orchestral music]

32:12.896 --> 32:15.623
All right, I think
it's all good.

32:18.005 --> 32:19.075
What's wrong?

32:19.109 --> 32:20.939
- The water, it's too deep.

32:22.492 --> 32:24.356
- It's not that deep,
it's just a tub.

32:25.529 --> 32:26.461
- It's too deep.

32:28.256 --> 32:30.017

When they get lost, they
sometimes need a place to stay.

32:49.933 --> 32:51.555
- Well, we can station a
car outside for the night.

32:51.590 --> 32:52.971
Just in case?

32:53.005 --> 32:53.799

33:35.875 --> 33:37.325
Yeah, this is Isla's mom.

33:40.501 --> 33:41.950
What do you mean she's
no longer in school?

33:41.985 --> 33:43.469
How the hell did you lose her?

34:48.085 --> 34:48.914
Isla?

34:50.295 --> 34:52.366
- You see, the trick
is to aim behind 'em.

34:53.850 --> 34:56.232
That way most of the force
comes from the acceleration.

34:57.716 --> 34:58.510
Yeah.

35:00.236 --> 35:01.340
- What happened to you?

35:01.375 --> 35:02.617
Why aren't you in school?

35:03.825 --> 35:06.414
- She was pushed into
the pool at school.

35:06.449 --> 35:07.450
You know something like
this happens to one

35:07.484 --> 35:08.485
in four children her age?

35:08.520 --> 35:09.348
- Are you okay?

35:10.315 --> 35:12.110
- The other kids
think I'm weird.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.041
- Oh.

35:13.076 --> 35:14.698
- I bet they're the weird ones.

35:14.733 --> 35:16.183
Don't you worry.

35:16.217 --> 35:18.185
I have a feeling something
like this won't happen again.

35:18.219 --> 35:19.358
- You sure you're okay?

35:21.981 --> 35:24.191
Thanks Mark, for
bringing her home.

35:24.225 --> 35:26.434
- It's not a problem, I saw
her walking on the street

35:26.469 --> 35:28.333
and knew I had to
take the initiative.

35:31.025 --> 35:32.751

35:32.785 --> 35:33.855
It's a big house.

after by yourself.

35:38.446 --> 35:39.413

35:39.447 --> 35:40.276
I know.

35:40.310 --> 35:42.070
I'm, I'm fine, it's uh-

35:42.105 --> 35:43.555
- Clearly you're not fine.

35:43.589 --> 35:46.316
I mean, your child left
school and you had no idea.

35:46.351 --> 35:48.007
[suspenseful orchestral music]

35:48.042 --> 35:50.872
But, the important thing
is that she's safe, right?

35:54.462 --> 35:55.532
Anyway, I gotta go.

35:58.259 --> 35:59.502
Bye, Isla.

35:59.536 --> 36:01.089
Hopefully see you
again soon, okay?

36:08.545 --> 36:10.547

36:10.582 --> 36:12.239
It's softball season.

36:12.273 --> 36:13.101
See ya.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.144
- What did he say to you?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.663
- Just that you're friends,

36:22.697 --> 36:24.458
and you've been
ignoring him lately.

36:26.114 --> 36:28.358
- Well, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

36:31.499 --> 36:32.604
Anyway, you should've called me

36:32.638 --> 36:34.122
after what happened at school.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.884
If there's a
problem, you tell me.

36:38.886 --> 36:41.095
We should have total
transparency, you and I.

36:42.648 --> 36:43.718

36:43.753 --> 36:45.272
It means total honesty.

36:46.928 --> 36:47.757
- Okay.

36:50.587 --> 36:53.590
- [Emma] You're really
getting into this now, huh?

36:53.625 --> 36:55.213
- That one's supposed to be you.

37:18.477 --> 37:19.892

went to the refrigerator

when I got to the door,

totally forgot what I wanted.

38:51.915 --> 38:53.572
- Yeah, was not the same.

you're under a lotta
stress, a lotta pressure,

39:02.029 --> 39:04.307
I mean, you took the news
of Patrick pretty hard.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.517
Well, you did.

39:07.552 --> 39:09.864
I mean, come on Ems, look
at where you are now,

39:09.899 --> 39:12.522
you're living in a
dead guy's house.

39:13.937 --> 39:15.180
- Well, you don't think he-

39:15.214 --> 39:16.423
- What?

39:16.457 --> 39:18.908
That Patrick's ghost
is roaming the house?

Tell ya what.

39:25.604 --> 39:27.054
Why don't I help you out?

39:27.088 --> 39:29.436
I'll take a load off,
I'll pick up the ball

39:29.470 --> 39:31.196
when things get too heavy.

39:31.230 --> 39:32.784
You can crash here tonight.

your mom with dinner.

40:27.528 --> 40:29.357
Wait, what happened?

40:29.392 --> 40:31.705
- One of the kids
had a bad accident,

40:31.739 --> 40:32.947
so I finished early.

40:32.982 --> 40:35.191

one was seriously hurt.

with you and your mom?

40:47.203 --> 40:49.930

doesn't want me around.

- Of course she
wants you around.

think she doesn't?

40:56.039 --> 40:57.351
- Because she left before.

41:00.285 --> 41:01.666
- That was different.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.150
She was sick.

41:03.184 --> 41:05.221
- That's not what Grandma said.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.464
- What did she tell you?

41:09.915 --> 41:11.538
Have you talked
to Emma about it?

41:14.437 --> 41:16.612
- We're supposed to
have total transparency.

41:18.234 --> 41:22.825
- You know, they
say that parenthood
completely changes you.

41:22.859 --> 41:25.103
That having a kid kinda just

41:25.137 --> 41:27.243
puts your life into perspective.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.347
- Is that true?

41:29.383 --> 41:30.591
- I don't know.

41:30.626 --> 41:31.592
I mean, it's never
happened to me,

41:31.627 --> 41:33.663
but I've seen it
in other people.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.908
- Did it happen to Emma?

41:36.942 --> 41:38.012
- More than you think.

41:39.048 --> 41:40.808
- What was she like before?

41:40.843 --> 41:44.432
- Oh, before, [chuckles]

41:44.467 --> 41:47.056
She was a lot like me.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.334
[chuckles]

41:53.096 --> 41:58.032
- 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100!

early, you should've called.

I could've picked you up.

44:00.430 --> 44:01.328

44:28.804 --> 44:31.979
Isla, is there something you'd
like to tell me about this?

44:32.014 --> 44:32.842
Just found it.

44:35.051 --> 44:35.880
Isla?

44:38.399 --> 44:40.160
Would you look at me
when I'm talkin' to you?

44:42.127 --> 44:42.956
Hey.

44:44.336 --> 44:46.304
Thought we agreed on
total transparency.

44:47.650 --> 44:48.478
Hmm?

44:50.757 --> 44:54.174
- You disappear when you see it.

44:54.208 --> 44:55.037
- What?

44:56.038 --> 44:57.453
- The lost ghost.

45:00.594 --> 45:02.251
- Look, I know
what I said before,

45:02.285 --> 45:04.287
but there are no such
things as ghosts.

45:05.944 --> 45:08.084
- You mean there's
no lost ghost?

45:08.119 --> 45:08.947
- No.

45:10.846 --> 45:13.711
But there's an explanation
for everything.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.057
Things just don't disappear.

45:15.091 --> 45:16.644
They always show up in the end.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.373

you fuckin' kidding me?

else to do, who to turn to.

to come here, Father.

After what I did.

who've lost their way,

wasn't the first time

you had gone through
something like this?

- That was different.

01:02:15.283 --> 01:02:16.871
I was different.

01:02:16.905 --> 01:02:21.876

only started again recently.

- Yeah.

Ever since, um...

- Since Isla returned
to your life?

01:02:29.849 --> 01:02:34.302

evil to latch themselves

the bodies of innocents,

01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:40.135
to feed off sin.

[dramatic orchestral music]

01:02:42.586 --> 01:02:45.071
- Are you saying Isla has
something evil inside her?

01:02:45.106 --> 01:02:49.006
- I'm saying, you need to
make peace with your child.

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:56.048
Tell me, has Isla been baptized?

01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:04.159
[grunts softly]

01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:07.059
- I think I'll
have a coffee too.

01:03:08.543 --> 01:03:10.476
[hums]

01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:14.204
Um, do you have the pancakes?

01:03:31.255 --> 01:03:32.084
Uh, excuse me?

01:03:33.292 --> 01:03:34.120
Excuse me.

01:03:35.121 --> 01:03:35.950
Excuse me.

01:03:37.572 --> 01:03:38.366
Hey.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.850
Is, is this gluten free?

01:03:39.885 --> 01:03:41.852
I can't have anything
with gluten in it.

01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:43.681
- Excuse me.

01:03:43.716 --> 01:03:44.959
Emma!

01:03:44.993 --> 01:03:46.995
You can't leave in the
middle of your shift!

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.824
Emma!

01:03:49.446 --> 01:03:51.241
[door slamming]

01:04:31.937 --> 01:04:34.077
- [Isla] Ghost, it's
just the lost ghost,

01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:36.976
it's just the lost ghost,
it's just the lost ghost,

01:04:37.011 --> 01:04:39.876
it's just the lost ghost,
just the lost ghost,

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:44.121
it's just the lost ghost,
it's just the lost ghost.

01:04:45.364 --> 01:04:47.262
- [Emma] Who were
you talking to?

01:04:47.297 --> 01:04:49.333
- [Isla] Nobody.

01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:51.025
- I saw you talking.

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:56.789
Who were you talkin' to?

[suspenseful orchestral music]

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:20.157
- It wasn't me.

01:05:21.158 --> 01:05:22.573
- Then who?

01:05:22.608 --> 01:05:23.712
Then who, Isla?

01:05:23.747 --> 01:05:25.749
There's no one else here!

01:05:25.783 --> 01:05:26.992
C'mon.

01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:29.028
There's nobody else in
this house, can you see?

01:05:32.204 --> 01:05:33.032
Oh, shit.

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:37.934
[banging on door]

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:38.796
- Emma?

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:43.767
Emma?

01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:45.424
It's Mark!

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:47.771
I know you're home, your
car's in the driveway.

01:05:50.843 --> 01:05:53.121
Is this the way you treat
people that help you?

01:05:55.813 --> 01:05:56.607
Emma?

01:05:59.093 --> 01:05:59.886
Emma?

01:06:01.543 --> 01:06:02.372
Emma!

01:06:09.206 --> 01:06:10.552
Okay.

01:06:10.587 --> 01:06:12.451
It's clear you need a
little bit more time

01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:14.142
to think about this.

01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:18.181

01:07:49.306 --> 01:07:50.100
Isla?

01:07:50.135 --> 01:07:50.928
[screaming]

01:07:50.963 --> 01:07:51.791
Isla!

01:07:54.622 --> 01:07:56.727
Isla, Isla get up.

01:07:56.762 --> 01:07:57.590
Shh!

[breathes rapidly]

01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:07.945

[suspenseful orchestral music]

01:08:18.645 --> 01:08:21.890

right here, okay?

01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:00.964
[breathing heavily]

01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:10.111
Do you think it
could be Patrick?

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:13.977
Do you think he, he could, I
dunno, be here somewhere still?

01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:18.050
I, I know it sounds crazy
but I, I can't think

01:09:18.084 --> 01:09:19.258
of any other explanation.

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:21.260
It's not, it's not just me, it's

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.988
Isla, she's seeing
things too, she's-

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.265
- She's seven years old.

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:30.752
Children have an abstract
way of viewing the world

01:09:30.787 --> 01:09:33.720
that can be
influenced by adults.

01:09:33.755 --> 01:09:36.171
- You're saying
it's all in my head.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:39.761
- I'm saying you're regressing
to your old patterns.

01:09:42.247 --> 01:09:44.697
I think you should
come to my office.

01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:46.768
Talk about it in person.

01:09:46.803 --> 01:09:48.943
I'll have someone call
you first thing tomorrow

01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:50.255
to arrange an appointment.

01:09:52.497 --> 01:09:57.469
In the mean time, I suggest
you try to get some rest.

01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:01.818
Are you gonna be okay?

01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:02.681
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:07.513 --> 01:10:08.376

01:11:37.465 --> 01:11:38.294
Ash?

01:11:42.884 --> 01:11:43.713
Ashley!

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:49.857
- Don't worry, she'll
turn up in the end.

[knocking on window]

01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:10.671
- You know you can't sleep here.

01:12:10.705 --> 01:12:11.741
- I'm sorry, Officer.

01:12:17.781 --> 01:12:19.196
- License and registration.

[dramatic orchestral music]

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:33.901
- Life is filled with trials.

01:12:33.935 --> 01:12:37.905
And many of us lose our
way, but it's all part

01:12:37.939 --> 01:12:41.011
of the journey to
get to the other side

01:12:41.046 --> 01:12:43.462
with our faith in
Jesus unwavering.

01:12:43.497 --> 01:12:46.810
It brings great pleasure
to welcome Emma back

01:12:46.845 --> 01:12:49.330
into our community, along
with her daughter, Isla.

01:12:50.227 --> 01:12:51.677
- No, please!

01:12:51.712 --> 01:12:54.335
- Within these waters,
those who are with sin

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.993
will be reborn with salvation
from the Lord Jesus.

01:12:57.027 --> 01:12:59.547
- [Isla] Please, no, please.

01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:00.962
- Emma came to me the other day

01:13:00.997 --> 01:13:03.517
seeking salvation for herself,

01:13:03.551 --> 01:13:04.552
and for her daughter.

01:13:05.967 --> 01:13:08.418
Do you accept the Lord
Jesus Christ as your savior?

01:13:08.453 --> 01:13:10.006
- No, please, Emma!

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:10.972
No!

01:13:11.007 --> 01:13:12.249
Don't let them do this, please!

01:13:12.284 --> 01:13:13.837
- [Father] Upon the
profession of faith,

01:13:13.872 --> 01:13:16.461
I hereby baptize Isla

01:13:16.495 --> 01:13:20.223
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Isla?

01:15:47.266 --> 01:15:48.578
Oh!

Isla?

Isla!

01:16:24.718 --> 01:16:26.961
Isla, come outta there, please.

01:16:26.996 --> 01:16:28.722
- You'll hurt me
and get rid of me.

01:16:28.756 --> 01:16:30.413
- I promise you I won't.

01:16:30.447 --> 01:16:31.690
- You've done it before.

Emma, remember?

01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:37.454
- Yeah, okay.

01:16:38.835 --> 01:16:41.182
I'll be honest with you about
everything and anything.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:49.432

- Yes.

Look, I, I won't try and
make any excuses, okay?

01:17:02.514 --> 01:17:05.172
What I did was one of the
biggest mistakes of my life.

01:17:06.587 --> 01:17:08.520
But, being with you now

01:17:10.108 --> 01:17:12.248
has changed everything,
I've changed.

01:17:14.491 --> 01:17:15.527
- Have you?

01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:16.908
- I would do anything for you.

01:17:16.942 --> 01:17:19.117
I would go to the ends
of the earth for you.

01:17:20.187 --> 01:17:22.258
- Why would you do such a thing?
