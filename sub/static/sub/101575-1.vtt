<i>Last season on </i>Star Trek Discovery:

00:15.098 --> 00:17.308
[Burnham]
<i>As long as there's any possibility</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:20.020
<i>of Control gaining access</i>
<i>to Discovery's Sphere data,</i>

00:20.103 --> 00:22.355
<i>everything will die. Always.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:27.861
You are proposing we remove <i>Discovery</i>
from the galactic equation entirely?

00:27.944 --> 00:29.654
<i>Discovery</i> has to go to the future

00:29.904 --> 00:31.740
to take the data out of this time,

00:31.823 --> 00:35.243
assuming I don't get lost in the wormhole.
It's a one-way trip.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.996
My mother should have returned
to her anchor point on Terralysium.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.999
So hopefully I will land there.
Apparently, this is what I'm meant to do.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.834
I love you, all of you.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.670
[Sylvia] We are here
because we're staying with you.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.380
-No.
-We're not asking permission.

00:47.464 --> 00:51.968
I am sure what you are about to say
will be beautiful but it is done, Michael,

00:52.051 --> 00:53.261
and we are running out of time.

00:54.804 --> 00:57.098
[Spock] I only wish I could be certain
of your safety.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.851
I'll send the last signal.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.521
I'll send it through the wormhole
when we get to the other side.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.023
I will watch the stars for it.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.777
Burnham to <i>Discovery,</i> let's go.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.241
You stole what I stole!

03:20.325 --> 03:21.367
So what?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.954
That's my cargo and you took it from me!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.831
It doesn't belong to you,
it belongs to itself.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.166
Open your damn mind.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.418
I will hunt you like a...

-Stop it!
-It doesn't belong to you!

12:10.479 --> 12:13.441
You think you can just take it
because you knocked me out of the sky?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.193
[Burnham] I'm not trying to take anything.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.155
-That was an accident!
-No one comes out here by accident!

12:19.238 --> 12:22.032
I am telling you, stop!
Now, nobody has to get hurt.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.951
-You might.
-I am not fighting you!

12:26.579 --> 12:29.290
You're fighting me. My name--

I listen better without you
holding that antique to my head.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.201
-You want to put that down?
-No.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.411
Okay. On three?

13:07.495 --> 13:09.246
-One--
-I'm counting!

13:09.330 --> 13:11.248
Fine, you count. Damn.

13:11.332 --> 13:15.002
One... two... three.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.394
-My name is--
-I do not want your acquaintance.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.689
The nearest natural wormhole
is 100 light-years from here.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.109
That means you came out of a wormhole you
created with tech from I don't know where.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.320
You think ripping holes in space
is a good idea?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.030
Wasn't bad enough for you

13:43.113 --> 13:45.282
the Gorn destroyed two light-years
worth of subspace?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.576
Wait, the Gorn did what?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.037
How many people do you think
are on channels right now saying:

13:50.120 --> 13:51.664
"I saw a crazy woman in a funny suit.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.499
Anyone wanna buy
some last-known coordinates?"

13:53.582 --> 13:56.043
Where'd you get that weapon?
I don't wanna know.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.213
Your Rocket Girl outfit scanned
for tritanium alloy.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.425
-Hasn't been anything like that in years.
-Do not call me Rocket Girl.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.138
You're not from around these parts.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.059
Go back to your own parts.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.687
I can't.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.148
Is this Terralysium?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.651
It's Hima. Who are you?

14:21.193 --> 14:23.028
Never mind. I don't wanna know.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.488
Where is Hima?

14:24.613 --> 14:26.031
-What star system?
-I'm on the clock.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.199
-What sector?
-Bye-bye.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.909
-What quadrant?
-Shh.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.786
My name is Michael--

14:33.038 --> 14:35.416
It was not my intention
to crash into your ship.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.836
I am sorry... for all of it.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.465
What's your name?

14:45.009 --> 14:46.385
[scoffs]

14:47.011 --> 14:48.679
-I lost my crew.
-Oh, yeah?

14:51.181 --> 14:53.893
They may be dead. I don't know where I am.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.061
I have nowhere to go back to.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.859
The only thing I can do right now
is trust something...

15:03.944 --> 15:06.697
or someone,
and I am sorry you don't want it to be...

15:08.908 --> 15:10.117
but it's you.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.494
So please.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.084
Please help me.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.864
Comms.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.366
[machine humming]

15:51.158 --> 15:53.160
Hey! Don't touch anything.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.414
Transmitter, receiver, subspace amplifier.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.168
-Nice.
-You know what'd be really nice?

16:01.251 --> 16:03.671
If you could whip up
a new dilithium recrystallizer.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.839
Mine cracked like a lychee
when you ran into my ship.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.135
I gotta get my cargo
to a certain planet by a certain time,

16:10.219 --> 16:12.262
so unless you have benamite lying around,

16:12.346 --> 16:15.057
and no one does,
I can't fly quantum slipstream.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.017
Tachyon solar cells are slow as shit,

16:17.101 --> 16:18.811
and don't even get me started
on trilithium.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.481
All of which means, thanks to you,
I need more dilithium.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.235
And the only place
I can trade for it is at the Mercantile,

16:26.318 --> 16:29.905
and there is nothing good about me
sticking my head up at the Mercantile.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.115
Right, baby?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.827
You have a very large cat.

16:34.910 --> 16:35.869
Yes.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.163
She has a thyroid condition.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.458
Does she have a name?

16:42.626 --> 16:43.502
Grudge.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.463
-Because...
-She's heavy...

16:47.381 --> 16:48.507
and all mine.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.220
[mews]

16:53.303 --> 16:54.513
The Mercantile.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.351
Is there a subspace comms array there?
A way that I can contact my ship?

16:59.435 --> 17:02.271
They've got nothing
unless you got something to trade.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.985
You have something? Because I need
dilithium and I'm space broke.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.404
Apparently, I have antiques.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.576
Can you get the dilithium
you need for this? It's a tricorder.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.126
-Cover that uniform. Try to look normal.
-You ever gonna tell me your name?

17:26.545 --> 17:29.548
Book. My name is Book.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.719
[beeping]

17:38.182 --> 17:40.059
Your cargo is temperature sensitive?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.986
And you don't want anyone else to find it.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.085
[Burnham] I'm guessing your cargo
used to be someone else's cargo.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.962
-[Book] It was never his.
-You stole it.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.422
[Book] I repatriated it.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.760
-You're a thief.
-[chuckles] Courier.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.430
Someone needs something
to get somewhere, I bring it.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.599
And I can say two things about you:

18:21.225 --> 18:24.436
That moral compass of yours led you
straight into a mid-space collision

18:24.520 --> 18:28.065
-that could've killed both of us.
-What's the other thing?

18:30.067 --> 18:31.276
You believe in ghosts.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.404
-What does that mean?
-That badge on your shirt.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.491
Sometimes you see a guy
with one of those badges

18:37.574 --> 18:40.160
getting himself all worked up
about the Federation.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.495
The old days.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.455
True believers.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.041
Can't handle that it's gone.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.255
The Federation is gone?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.345
That's impossible.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.352
What happened?

19:06.436 --> 19:07.271
Beats me.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.153
What happened?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.446
Collapsed, I guess.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.742
It was a long time ago, after the Burn.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.161
What's the Burn?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.579
What's the Burn?

19:25.497 --> 19:28.792
How can you not know this stuff?
Seriously, where are you from?

19:31.253 --> 19:32.337
I don't want to know.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.550
Please.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.304
The Burn was the day
the galaxy took a hard left.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.139
Dilithium.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.434
One day most of it just went, "Boom."

19:51.857 --> 19:54.443
Dilithium is the heart
of every warp-capable ship.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.490
What does that mean? Did it destabilize?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.995
-How?
-I don't know. A lot of people died.

20:05.078 --> 20:08.207
Federation couldn't say for sure
what happened, or why,

20:08.290 --> 20:09.958
or that it wouldn't happen again.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.544
Think they tried to hang on,
but after a while,

20:13.045 --> 20:14.338
they just weren't around anymore.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.385
That's not possible.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.725
-Okay.
-When?

20:27.392 --> 20:30.354
A hundred, 120 years ago?
Before I was born.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.152
No.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.448
No, the Federation isn't just about
ships and warp drive.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.621
It's about a vision and all those
who believe in that vision.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.499
That's nice.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.545
Do yourself a favor and take off
that badge before we get to Requiem.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.728
[indistinct chatter]

21:54.730 --> 21:55.731
Next!

21:59.860 --> 22:01.111
Stand here.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.656
The Andorians and the Orions
are working together?

22:05.907 --> 22:07.409
They don't get a lot of walk-ins here.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.454
Follow my lead. Try not to get us shot.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.748
[Andorian] Next, step up.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.336
[whirring and chirping]

22:29.389 --> 22:30.682
She stays out there.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.017
She's got something.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.106
I don't know what that is,
and if I did, I wouldn't care.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.525
She's not a courier, she stays out there.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.694
Pretend you're not Andorian
for one second

22:42.778 --> 22:44.112
and don't be a surly bastard.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.324
You know those antique collectors
who love to live in the past?

22:47.657 --> 22:49.284
This stuff's like the Holy Grail to them.

22:49.367 --> 22:53.455
I know Andorians don't do fun,
but there's a real market for this stuff.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.207
Your bosses are watching.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.587
You wanna be the one who tells them
you turned away a prime supplier.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.005
Fine.

23:04.674 --> 23:08.553
-No identification, no--
-[alien over comms] <i>Let them in.</i>

23:12.140 --> 23:14.392
-I wouldn't if it were up to me.
-It's not.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.815
This is gonna go bad if you have
to have the last word.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.108
Where's the communications hub?

23:21.191 --> 23:24.444
[Book] Relax, I told you I'd take you
there so you can call your damn ship.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.154
<i>Order 7543...</i>

23:26.905 --> 23:28.115
How does this work?

23:28.949 --> 23:31.576
Holo Seller fixes a price for an item.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.704
Holo Buyer negotiates, they make a deal.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.582
Regulator signs off,
confirms payment to the Orions.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.251
Orions pay couriers like me

23:39.334 --> 23:42.337
just enough dilithium to pick up
the item and make delivery.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.923
Then it's back here for another go-round.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.135
Every now and then,
we get to make a deal for ourselves.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.595
Like your tricorder.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.432
A portable transporter?

23:55.684 --> 23:56.810
Huh.

23:58.770 --> 24:02.315
Subspace array's through here.
Keep your head down.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.025
We set now?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.571
[Burnham] A deal's a deal.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.076
I hope you get what you need for it.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.454
Good luck.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.584
[whirring]

24:22.210 --> 24:26.006
This is their vault, not their comms.
You're in a stasis beam.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.593
You don't know what you're doing.
My-- My crew.

24:29.676 --> 24:32.721
Everybody's got a story.
A broken tricorder won't cut it.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.890
I need all the dilithium I can get
to finish my run.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.601
When I get out of this,
I am coming for you.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.102
You and everybody else.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.105
I'm sorry.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.319
[drone] <i>Do not move. You are under arrest.</i>

24:56.286 --> 24:59.623
So even if you managed
to get into our vault...

25:00.040 --> 25:02.083
what makes you think you could
get out of here alive?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.504
-That wasn't rhetorical. Answer.
-Where's your ship?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.048
Who are you working with?

25:08.548 --> 25:10.133
-I don't have a ship.
-Yes, you do.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.302
-or you wouldn't be here.
-She's working with somebody.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.804
-Where's the vintage tech?
-He asked where's the merchandise?

25:14.888 --> 25:17.182
I got robbed in the stasis beam.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.600
Nobody's that stupid.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.478
-I am gonna hurt that man.
-Who?

25:21.561 --> 25:22.562
[sighs]

25:28.276 --> 25:29.110
[groans]

25:35.951 --> 25:37.744
[Ithor in distorted voice]
This is taking too long.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.162
I'm hungry, let's get a sandwich.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.997
Oh!

25:42.040 --> 25:44.167
[giggling]

25:47.170 --> 25:48.463
Damn.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.547
-Finally.
-[Burnham laughs]

25:49.631 --> 25:50.632
Here we go.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.968
[snoring]

25:53.593 --> 25:54.636
Well, that's not right.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.596
Did you adjust the dosage again?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.807
I've told you so many times
not to do that!

25:58.890 --> 26:01.101
This stuff has a real,
integral consciousness.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.900
Yeah. It makes people truthful. They talk.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.277
Yes! I feel that! I feel you!

26:10.360 --> 26:12.279
I get it! I have a friend.
You can't give her any.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.156
-Where did you get the vintage gear?
-Vintage's a matter of perspective.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.117
To me, you are aqua,
to me, you are forest green.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.452
How are you connected to the Federation?

26:19.536 --> 26:21.788
I'm dying to talk about it.
I'm dying to talk about it

26:21.871 --> 26:24.416
because today does not happen to people...

26:26.209 --> 26:27.669
ever.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.879
I might be angry about it. I'm supportive.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.756
I mean, I'm so supportive.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.634
I am reflexively supportive
and what is that about?

26:34.718 --> 26:36.344
I'm overcompensating.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.764
I gotta talk to someone. You need to sit.
Can you sit?

26:39.848 --> 26:42.726
It's a super cool story,
it's just in a completely devastating way.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.520
Hadley, look,
I need more dilithium or I'm done.

26:45.603 --> 26:46.855
Uh-huh.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.482
I need you to access your highest self
in this moment.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.567
Why?

26:50.650 --> 26:52.277
I'm accessing my highest self.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.864
Can we both just imagine
what this world would feel like

26:55.947 --> 26:59.576
-if we accessed--
-If you stop talking? Yes.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.286
That would feel nice,

27:01.369 --> 27:04.372
which is why I'm walking away now.
No deal.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.291
What--? Hadley, wait.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.294
You're welcome.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.712
Move.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.380
Slowly.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.341
[Book] Cosmo, nice to see you again.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.342
[Cosmo] Shut up!

27:15.425 --> 27:18.094
We left everything that I have ever known

27:18.178 --> 27:22.390
or loved behind me
for the sake of creation! Right?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.684
If you think about it, let's be honest...

27:25.643 --> 27:27.729
I saved all the things.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.651
Oh... And then I shot out
of a wormhole and I hit a guy.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.487
[in unison] What guy?

27:35.570 --> 27:39.074
Uh, him, him. You know, I--
He-- He stole somebody's cargo

27:39.157 --> 27:41.117
-and he can't fly for shit. He--
-Wait.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.453
One of our guys?

27:44.287 --> 27:45.663
-A courier?
-[Burnham] Yeah!

27:46.247 --> 27:48.500
You have a real problem
if your couriers are stealing stuff

27:48.583 --> 27:50.794
and then colliding with thousand-year-old
women in space.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.128
What cargo was he hauling?

27:52.212 --> 27:54.255
I don't know,
but it was temperature-sensitive

27:54.339 --> 27:56.049
and valuable, so it's probably ice cream.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.676
-Is he still in the building?
-What's his name?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.845
-Book.
-[grunts]

28:00.929 --> 28:02.806
Where is it?

28:06.559 --> 28:08.478
I'm going to slow-roast Grudge

28:08.561 --> 28:12.482
and feed her to the starving.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.150
Keep her name out of your mouth, Cosmo.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.112
She'll feed a whole planet.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.613
She's a queen.

28:18.696 --> 28:19.739
[Ithyk] Stop!

28:21.616 --> 28:23.326
-Gotta go.
-Is that him?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.244
[Burnham] Yep.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.621
-Hey.
-Hi.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.039
[all laughing]

28:30.750 --> 28:31.668
Hello to you, too.

28:33.253 --> 28:36.506
Does anyone care if I shoot him?

28:36.589 --> 28:38.675
You're not allowed a weapon in here.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.969
[Cosmo] He stole my cargo.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.555
Let me shoot him.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.265
Get our cargo back first.

28:45.348 --> 28:48.810
Fine. Can I shoot her, then?

28:48.893 --> 28:50.603
[weapon whirring]

28:55.275 --> 28:58.153
Aw, man. [chuckles]

29:02.282 --> 29:04.033
[grunting]

29:08.788 --> 29:09.956
[screams]

29:22.302 --> 29:24.137
Do you think I'm compensating
for something?

29:24.220 --> 29:26.014
They sprayed you with that stuff,
didn't they?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.223
They sure did.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.851
Adrenaline will knock it
out of you in a bit.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.311
Okay.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.734
[laughing]

29:54.375 --> 29:55.835
[Burnham gasps]

29:55.919 --> 29:57.462
[laughing]

29:57.587 --> 29:59.005
What?

30:23.238 --> 30:25.406
Give me the dilithium.
Throw it, you can come with me.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.784
I am done being reflexively supportive!

30:27.867 --> 30:29.077
Come on!

30:29.160 --> 30:30.995
Where is the comms array?

30:43.508 --> 30:44.801
Hang on.

30:49.556 --> 30:50.390
[both grunt]

30:56.604 --> 30:58.523
We have to move, they'll be tracking the--

31:00.066 --> 31:01.484
I need to call my ship.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.236
[Book] First things first.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.529
[grunting and yelling]

31:14.247 --> 31:15.540
We have to go.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.634
-Go, go, go!
-Oh.

31:43.109 --> 31:46.487
-[grunts] Get us out of here!
-It needs 30 seconds to recharge!

31:56.789 --> 31:59.334
I may have broken your nose earlier.
I apologize.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.544
-You saying that in case we die?
-Yup!

32:04.839 --> 32:06.215
Book, come on.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.967
It's still charging!

32:11.846 --> 32:12.931
[groans]

32:14.432 --> 32:17.185
-Okay, you're about to be really mad!
-What?

32:32.742 --> 32:34.827
[both gasping]

32:53.721 --> 32:57.225
They can't track us underwater
or into solid material.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.351
[chuckles]

32:59.978 --> 33:01.312
-You're welcome.
-[grunts]

33:06.025 --> 33:09.112
-[Burnham] You pushed me off a cliff.
-I told you, you were gonna be mad.

33:09.904 --> 33:13.449
If you're thinking
about punching me again, we're alive.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.995
I could've guessed coordinates
inside a rock.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.288
But they'll find us soon enough.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.083
Haven't been shot in a while.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.562
[speaking in alien language]

34:18.181 --> 34:19.140
What was that?

34:20.183 --> 34:22.268
Don't want your arm to get infected.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.937
Were you...

34:25.897 --> 34:26.731
praying?

34:26.814 --> 34:27.857
Something like.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.906
[groans]

34:35.740 --> 34:37.450
-Got a bite to it.
-Mm-hm.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.952
Probably still wrap it though.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.663
You carry a handkerchief?

34:43.623 --> 34:45.041
Man's gotta blow his nose.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.302
[Burnham grunts]

34:58.888 --> 35:01.766
I'm opening up whatever
subspace channels still exist,

35:01.849 --> 35:02.683
but make it fast.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.601
[beeping]

35:03.684 --> 35:07.438
Cosmo won't buy me dying that easy,
he'll be scanning for us.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.443
That does a bit of everything,
call your ship.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.071
You had this the whole time
and you're just showing me now?

35:15.154 --> 35:16.781
Your people are waiting for you.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.412
Burnham to <i>Discovery,</i> come in.

35:29.460 --> 35:34.090
<i>Discovery</i>... please come in.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.887
<i>Discovery,</i> please come in.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.185
Maybe they made it to that planet,
Terralysium.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.191
If any crew on any ship
could make it through, it's mine.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.696
-True believer.
-Yeah.

35:57.905 --> 35:58.823
Time traveler.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.331
-Yeah.
-I figured.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.879
Don't know how you came by
whatever you used to get here.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.673
All time travel technology was destroyed

36:15.756 --> 36:19.677
after the Temporal Wars. Outlawed.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.933
There was no other way.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.061
For me...

36:34.692 --> 36:35.902
or my crew.

36:38.654 --> 36:42.116
I have to find them. I have to.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.670
Good, still got a few hours.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.673
This wasn't just about Grudge
being lonely.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.633
Nope.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.177
-Are you gonna tell me what's in the hole?
-Nope.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.137
Stop! Freeze!

37:03.221 --> 37:04.388
Don't move.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.849
Don't.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.101
Drop your weapons.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.080
What good is a courier
who lets his cargo get stolen?

37:29.163 --> 37:32.291
Hey, I'm the best runner
you have in the Quadrant.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.214
Access code?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.549
-You don't want it.
-I think I do.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.510
Oh, we definitely do.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.762
Really. You don't.

37:44.845 --> 37:45.888
[weapons cocking]

37:45.972 --> 37:48.266
[Ithyk] Give us the code now.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.018
Okay, fine.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.147
-Sticky.
-What?

37:56.315 --> 37:58.526
S-T-I-C-K-Y.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.279
What kind of code is that?

38:01.362 --> 38:03.072
That's the damn code, all right?

38:03.155 --> 38:04.782
Pick your own code on your own ship.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.619
[beeping]

38:26.637 --> 38:27.638
[Ithor] Don't shoot it.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.143
It's served fresh.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.148
It looks smaller on the holo.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.443
It's not moving. Is it dead?

38:42.611 --> 38:44.447
[snarling]

38:45.948 --> 38:47.575
[whispering] Close your eyes.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.222
[shrieking]

39:33.371 --> 39:34.872
[roaring]

39:35.581 --> 39:36.582
Whoa!

39:37.375 --> 39:38.542
Oh, uh...

39:40.461 --> 39:43.798
-Book?
-Stay still, please.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.424
No, no.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.385
Molly, no!

39:48.844 --> 39:50.638
[speaking in alien language]

40:11.826 --> 40:12.952
[yells then grunts]

40:14.495 --> 40:15.538
Thanks, girl.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.250
Hey, hey.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.294
[grunts]

40:22.378 --> 40:23.254
You all right?

40:23.921 --> 40:25.714
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

40:26.382 --> 40:30.094
I really, really didn't know
how this day was gonna turn out.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.929
-[laughs]
-[sighs]

40:32.012 --> 40:34.014
Okay, good.

40:56.245 --> 40:59.331
[Burnham] How long have you been
saving them, the Transworms?

40:59.415 --> 41:02.376
Not long enough.
They used to be everywhere,

41:02.460 --> 41:03.669
you know, before--

41:04.253 --> 41:05.880
Before the Federation fell.

41:09.383 --> 41:12.386
There's no one around to enforce
the Endangered Species Act.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.014
Except you.

41:21.687 --> 41:22.730
May I ask?

41:23.689 --> 41:26.567
You seem to have this
connection to things,

41:26.650 --> 41:28.944
plants, Transworms.

41:29.737 --> 41:34.033
What is it like, feeling everything?

41:35.075 --> 41:36.660
Uncomfortable.

41:39.079 --> 41:42.541
My family are killers... poachers.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.338
Every so often, one like me shows up
in the gene pool.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.549
I don't know, something to do
with balance, I guess.

41:51.717 --> 41:52.927
Do you still see them?

41:54.553 --> 41:55.721
I'm not welcome.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.142
I'm sorry.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.313
But I wouldn't trade who I am
for anything.

42:08.317 --> 42:09.985
I wouldn't wanna be different.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.532
[computer chimes]

42:16.408 --> 42:19.912
This is Cleveland Booker,
Mandelbrot set code Nautilus.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.122
One more to come home.

42:23.582 --> 42:27.253
[computer] <i>Your code is accepted, Book.</i>
<i>Welcome to Sanctuary Four.</i>

42:27.878 --> 42:29.129
Sanctuary?

42:29.797 --> 42:33.050
[roars]

42:36.637 --> 42:38.097
[Book speaking in alien language]

42:39.807 --> 42:41.225
[Book laughing]

42:55.239 --> 42:57.324
They have a breeding cycle.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.243
We got her here just in time.

43:03.038 --> 43:04.415
Some of them still make it.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.338
This is what my planet used to be like...

43:12.548 --> 43:14.174
until I had to leave it behind.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.679
How much did you leave behind?

43:21.890 --> 43:23.767
Nine hundred and thirty years.

43:25.769 --> 43:26.604
Why?

43:29.982 --> 43:31.567
To ensure the future.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.364
A future.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.035
Thank you.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.750
I didn't do it alone.

43:50.919 --> 43:53.339
I have no idea how to start
looking for my ship.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.469
I think I know someone who could help.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.939
[Book] <i>This is a courier way point.</i>

44:11.273 --> 44:13.651
<i>But it used to be a Federation</i>
<i>relay station.</i>

44:14.109 --> 44:15.569
[Burnham] <i>What happened?</i>

44:15.653 --> 44:19.406
[Book] <i>Main reactor breach probably,</i>
<i>long time ago.</i>

44:20.407 --> 44:22.701
<i>No one around to pick up</i>

44:24.995 --> 44:26.038
[alarm chimes]

44:26.121 --> 44:27.081
[computer] <i>Greetings.</i>

44:27.164 --> 44:30.084
<i>Please proceed to the attendant desk.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:36.006 --> 44:37.174
[Sahil] Hello.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.595
Welcome to Starfleet. May I help you?

44:46.684 --> 44:50.896
I'm Commander Michael Burnham,
Science Officer, <i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

44:51.480 --> 44:55.901
Serial number, SC0064-0974 SHN.

45:03.492 --> 45:06.120
[clears throat] I am Aditya Sahil,

45:06.995 --> 45:08.414
Federation liaison.

45:09.581 --> 45:13.377
It would be my honor to assist you,
Commander Burnham.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.964
I need to locate the warp signature
of a starship with the identifier

45:17.047 --> 45:18.757
NCC 1031.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.384
Yes, yes, of course.

45:28.267 --> 45:30.102
[beeping]

45:34.898 --> 45:38.152
I'm afraid... it's not here.

45:38.235 --> 45:41.447
I have two Federation ships
in flight at the moment.

45:41.530 --> 45:46.326
These are the only Federation ships
in a 600 light-year radius.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.162
What about the other sectors?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.789
I only have access to these sectors.

45:50.873 --> 45:53.959
You've been cut off
from the other sectors? Entirely?

45:55.169 --> 45:58.839
Long-range sensors failed decades ago.

45:58.922 --> 46:03.051
I have not been able to scan
beyond 30 sectors since then.

46:03.135 --> 46:07.973
I would imagine
it is the same for all others.

46:17.774 --> 46:18.775
May I ask...

46:20.527 --> 46:26.909
how is it you don't know what we all know?

46:29.453 --> 46:31.663
I'm from the past, Mr. Sahil.

46:32.456 --> 46:36.335
From before the Burn, before the collapse.

46:39.505 --> 46:43.050
My ship was right behind me
in the wormhole.

46:43.133 --> 46:48.972
So either they landed somewhere
way far out of comms range...

46:50.724 --> 46:52.476
or they're not here yet.

46:53.268 --> 46:54.186
Then...

46:55.604 --> 46:58.982
by the laws of temporal mechanics,

46:59.316 --> 47:04.363
-they could arrive tomorrow or--
-In a thousand years.

47:08.742 --> 47:09.910
[Burnham sighs softly]

47:13.956 --> 47:19.294
Commander Burnham,
now I'll tell you a secret.

47:20.546 --> 47:23.340
I'm not a commissioned officer.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.593
You see, my father was,
his father before him.

47:26.677 --> 47:30.389
But unlike them,
I was never officially sworn in.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.268
There has been no one to do it.

47:34.351 --> 47:40.524
Yet I watch this office every day,
as I have for 40 years,

47:40.607 --> 47:46.113
believing one day, others like me
would walk through that door.

47:47.155 --> 47:50.200
That my hope was not in vain.

47:51.285 --> 47:52.869
Today is that day.

47:54.121 --> 47:58.292
And that hope is you, Commander Burnham.

48:05.215 --> 48:06.466
True believers.

48:09.469 --> 48:10.804
Of course.

48:13.932 --> 48:19.062
I don't know how much
of the Federation still exists.

48:19.146 --> 48:22.482
I simply do my part to keep it alive.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.568
Now...

48:26.111 --> 48:29.364
I ask you to do me a great honor.

48:41.918 --> 48:45.297
This has been in my family
for generations.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.134
Only a commissioned officer may raise it.

48:50.469 --> 48:55.432
And I've waited so long
to see it on that wall.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.061
[Burnham] Mr. Sahil,

49:00.020 --> 49:05.525
you are as real a Federation officer
as any I have ever met.

49:06.318 --> 49:11.031
If you would do me the honor,
we need an acting communications chief

49:12.199 --> 49:14.326
who can keep searching for my ship.

49:17.954 --> 49:20.082
Will you accept the commission?

49:30.842 --> 49:33.428
[Sahil] Hope is a powerful thing.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.098
[Burnham] Sometimes it's the only thing.

49:36.181 --> 49:37.933
[Sahil] Our numbers are few.

49:38.558 --> 49:41.728
Our spirit is undiminished.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.817
If there are others out there,
we'll find them.

49:58.203 --> 49:59.246
We will.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.849
[closing theme playing]
