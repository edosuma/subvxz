00:02.235 --> 00:03.364
Just a minute.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.764
l'll... l'll,
l'll be right there.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.746
l'm coming. l'm coming.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.183
Deanna!

00:24.257 --> 00:25.554
Hello, Reg.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.684
l'm so glad you could make it.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.058
lt's wonderful to see you.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.627
Would it be all right
if l came inside?

00:32.698 --> 00:33.723
Yeah. Of course.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.892
Of course!

00:35.001 --> 00:36.332
Come in, come in.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.200
ls-is there something
l can get you?

00:39.272 --> 00:42.298
Some, um, some coffee? Tea?

00:42.409 --> 00:43.671
Oh, wait a minute.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.938
Don't... don't tell me.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.274
Chocolate ice cream.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.678
You know me too well.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.181
But just one scoop.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.842
l'm watching my figure.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.010
Why?!

00:53.086 --> 00:55.020
You... you look lovely.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.613
You always knew
how to flatter me.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.620
Would you like me to get it?

01:01.694 --> 01:03.662
Get... get what?

01:03.730 --> 01:04.890
The ice cream.

01:04.964 --> 01:06.591
Right! Right!
The ice cream.

01:06.666 --> 01:07.894
No, no. No, no, no.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.468
Come in, come in.

01:09.536 --> 01:10.628
Sit down...

01:10.737 --> 01:12.329
make yourself comfortable.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.204
lt's a nice place.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.335
Thanks.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.073
One scoop
of chocolate ice cream.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.614
Did you just move in?

01:22.682 --> 01:23.614
No, no.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.310
l've been here, uh...

01:25.385 --> 01:26.852
almost two years.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.650
l just haven't
had a chance to unpack.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.952
ls everything all right, Reg?

01:34.027 --> 01:34.959
Of course.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.528
Why, why wouldn't it be?

01:36.596 --> 01:39.429
To be honest,
you seem a little on edge.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.400
Do l? Oh, oh,
it's just that l'm...

01:42.502 --> 01:43.833
l'm excited to see you.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.700
l'm excited to see you, too.

01:45.805 --> 01:46.772
l think Geordi's

01:46.840 --> 01:48.398
a little disappointed

01:48.508 --> 01:51.102
l didn't invite
him to come along.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.168
Yes, l... well,
l-l was hoping to get...

01:53.246 --> 01:54.679
get together with him, too,

01:54.747 --> 01:57.341
uh, before
the Enterprise leaves orbit,

01:57.417 --> 02:00.147
but l just wanted to spend
some time with you first.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.187
That's all right,

02:01.254 --> 02:02.983
-isn't it?
-Of course it is.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.887
l hear you've been working
on the Pathfinder Project.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.488
Well, l...

02:12.565 --> 02:14.863
l was, uh...

02:14.968 --> 02:16.435
l'm not anymore.

02:16.503 --> 02:17.435
What happened?

02:17.504 --> 02:18.436
Oh, uh...

02:18.505 --> 02:20.234
nothing... really.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.469
Just got to be a lot of, uh...

02:23.543 --> 02:25.010
pressure.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.078
Well, hello!

02:26.179 --> 02:27.908
Neelix!

02:27.981 --> 02:29.881
Oh, he's not used to company.
Oh.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.747
lt's not polite
to eat our guest's food.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.878
lf you're hungry,
just say so.

02:34.954 --> 02:37.787
Deanna, uh, Neelix.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.415
Neelix?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.460
That's an unusual name.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.391
Maybe we should introduce him

02:45.465 --> 02:46.932
to Data's cat, Spot.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.964
l have a feeling

02:51.070 --> 02:54.506
you didn't ask me here
to reminisce.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.906
Tell me what's wrong.

03:02.081 --> 03:05.608
l've lost myself, Deanna.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.915
Lost yourself?

03:09.989 --> 03:11.456
ln Voyager.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.424
l've become obsessed

03:13.493 --> 03:16.394
with Voyager.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:06.539 --> 05:08.166
Here you are on shore leave

05:08.274 --> 05:09.298
and what do l do?

05:09.409 --> 05:12.435
l lure you into
a counseling session.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.706
Don't worry about that.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.543
The important thing is

05:15.615 --> 05:18.277
l'm here now,
and l want to help.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.716
Thank you.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.117
Now...

05:21.187 --> 05:23.246
start at the beginning.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.484
Has it ever occurred to you

05:25.558 --> 05:27.526
that a tachyon beam

05:27.593 --> 05:30.289
directed at a class-B
itinerant pulsar

05:30.363 --> 05:32.661
could produce
enough gravimetric energy

05:32.732 --> 05:34.700
to create an artificial
singularity?

05:34.801 --> 05:36.393
l can't say it has.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.992
lt occurred to me,

05:38.104 --> 05:42.541
but my supervisors thought
it was an abuse of MlDAS.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.098
MlDAS?

05:44.210 --> 05:45.541
The, uh, Mutara lnterdimensional

05:45.611 --> 05:47.545
Deep Space Transponder Array.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.376
Reg, you're losing me.

05:49.449 --> 05:50.677
l'm sorry.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.615
The beginning.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.313
The beginning-- right.

05:57.390 --> 06:01.588
Well, l suppose it all started
in the holodeck.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.185
Doesn't it always?

06:04.230 --> 06:05.424
Go on.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.125
Well...

06:07.200 --> 06:09.100
l...

06:09.202 --> 06:11.432
l was running
a few simulations.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.370
Computer, boost the gain
on Voyager's transceiver

06:14.440 --> 06:15.634
by 20 percent.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.972
Transceiver gain is at maximum.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.414
Apply a narrowband filter
to the signal processor.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.347
Filter engaged.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.715
Voyager, come in.

06:27.787 --> 06:28.981
Come in, Voyager.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.751
Voyager, come in.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.815
This is Starfleet Command.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.020
Voyager, come in, Voyager.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.154
Good. Good, good.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.029
Now, lower the filter band
by .3 kilohertz.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.398
Reg, what are you doing?

06:43.503 --> 06:44.936
Oh.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.938
Uh, um, Pete.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.234
l-l-l was just, uh...

06:49.308 --> 06:50.935
Yes, running
another simulation.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.102
l can see that.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.611
What about
the transmitter diagnostics?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.670
Right. The diagnostics.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.943
You have finished them,
haven't you?

06:58.017 --> 06:59.075
Uh... almost.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.676
Almost isn't good enough.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.120
We've got Admiral Paris
first thing in the morning.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.282
Admiral Paris?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.950
Don't tell me you forgot.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.926
Oh, no, of-of... of course not.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.826
l-l-l just got
the days mixed up.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.227
Reg!

07:12.298 --> 07:13.629
Computer, end program.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.827
Now that l think about it,
it's a good thing

07:17.003 --> 07:19.836
that Admiral Paris
is coming tomorrow.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.066
We can brief the Admiral

07:21.174 --> 07:22.141
on my theory.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.367
What theory?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.501
l've been going over

07:24.577 --> 07:26.545
the interstellar
phenomena forecasts

07:26.612 --> 07:27.874
from Deep Space 9.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.345
They are predicting, uh,

07:29.415 --> 07:31.679
a class-B itinerant pulsar

07:31.751 --> 07:34.720
will pass within
four billion kilometers

07:34.787 --> 07:36.778
of the MlDAS Array
in three days.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.847
You think the pulsar
might damage the Array?

07:38.925 --> 07:40.586
No, no. The
shields will hold.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.854
Actually, l was thinking, uh,

07:41.928 --> 07:44.123
we could use the pulsar
to our own advantage.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.789
How?

07:45.865 --> 07:48.527
Suppose... suppose we instructed
the Array to direct

07:48.634 --> 07:50.363
a tachyon beam at the pulsar.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.906
Theoretically, we could
produce a gravimetric surge

07:53.973 --> 07:57.670
powerful enough to create
an artificial wormhole.

07:57.743 --> 08:01.042
We could establish
two-way communication

08:01.113 --> 08:02.375
with Voyager.

08:02.448 --> 08:03.813
Reg, you're dreaming again.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.418
No, no, l-l really think
this could work.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.646
Based on
my simulations, that...

08:07.720 --> 08:09.711
Based on your last series
of simulations,

08:09.789 --> 08:11.723
we wasted six months
trying to develop

08:11.791 --> 08:12.780
that transwarp probe.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.986
This... this is
different. This...

08:15.061 --> 08:17.291
Reg... l really appreciate

08:17.363 --> 08:18.660
your imagination.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.529
lt's what makes you such
a valuable part of this team,

08:21.601 --> 08:23.501
but l'm not about to tell
the Admiral

08:23.603 --> 08:26.231
that we've found a way
for him to chat with his son

08:26.339 --> 08:27.829
because of some
cockeyed theory

08:28.007 --> 08:29.565
that only exists up here.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.701
Now, please,
finish those diagnostics.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.268
Yes, sir.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.980
And, Reg,

08:41.053 --> 08:42.350
remember--

08:42.421 --> 08:43.888
while the Admiral's here,

08:43.956 --> 08:45.014
l do the talking.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.149
You do the talking.

08:46.225 --> 08:47.749
Understood.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.562
Pete was only trying
to look out for me,

08:51.631 --> 08:54.225
but l was sure
my plan would work.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.097
l, l just couldn't give it up.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.704
Burning the midnight oil.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.806
l-l finished, uh,
the diagnostics, sir.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.542
Yes. l know.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.108
l looked them over.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.448
Good job.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.986
Well, why don't you
call it a day?

09:23.062 --> 09:26.088
l just, uh, have
a few more things

09:26.165 --> 09:27.632
to take care of.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.895
Well, see you tomorrow, then.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.229
Oh. Reg, why don't, um...

09:35.341 --> 09:37.138
why don't you drop by tonight

09:37.209 --> 09:38.801
when you're through here?

09:38.878 --> 09:40.209
''Drop by''?

09:40.279 --> 09:41.541
Come to the house.

09:41.614 --> 09:42.808
Have some coffee.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.873
Angie's sister
is in from Boston.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.578
l, uh...

09:46.652 --> 09:48.244
l think she might like you.

09:48.321 --> 09:53.088
l-l don't, l don't think l...
can, uh...

09:53.159 --> 09:56.720
l'm spending the evening
with, um...

09:56.796 --> 09:58.263
Neelix.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.356
Correct me if l'm wrong, Reg,

10:00.433 --> 10:02.424
but Neelix is your cat.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.940
Well, if you change your mind.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.531
Thanks.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.610
l'll... l'll try.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.670
But l couldn't leave,

10:15.748 --> 10:17.181
not until
l'd strengthened my case

10:17.249 --> 10:18.511
for accessing the MlDAS Array.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.644
The meeting with Admiral Paris
was only 14 hours away,

10:21.721 --> 10:23.712
and l hadn't come up
with anything.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.257
Poring over the data
wasn't helping.

10:26.325 --> 10:33.891
l decided that what l needed
was, um, a little inspiration.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.490
Computer...

10:35.601 --> 10:38.069
activate hologrid
Mess Hall scenario

10:38.170 --> 10:40.104
Barclay 1 1-Gamma.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.002
Hey, Reg.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.011
Warning. The
shark is circling.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.311
Let the games begin.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.476
What'll it be, Reg?

10:52.551 --> 10:53.711
The usual.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.913
Computer, one milk, warm.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.319
Oh, thanks, Harry.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.756
Just trying to get
on your good side,

10:59.825 --> 11:01.850
so you'll go easy
on me tonight.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.724
Ah, you know
what l always say--

11:03.763 --> 11:05.458
if you can't stand
the heat...

11:05.531 --> 11:07.158
Get out of the warp core.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.325
Sit down, Lieutenant,

11:08.434 --> 11:10.493
and give us mortals
a chance to get even.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.535
That's an order.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.730
lf you insist, Commander,

11:12.838 --> 11:14.601
but l think it's only fair
to warn you

11:14.674 --> 11:15.606
l have no intention

11:15.675 --> 11:17.802
of letting my winning streak
come to an end.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.103
Now, where's,

11:20.179 --> 11:21.646
um, Tuvok?

11:21.714 --> 11:22.908
He said it's illogical

11:22.982 --> 11:25.348
to continue losing
to a clearly superior player.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.885
Oh, that's too bad.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.352
l love to watch
that Vulcan squirm.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.447
Now, you all know the rules.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.118
Deuces, one-eyed jacks
and suicide kings are wild.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.094
Five of a kind beats
a straight flush every time.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.391
The man is ruthless.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.396
He's a killer.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.194
Now, come on, guys.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.791
You know it hurts me
to see you lose.

11:43.903 --> 11:47.600
After all,
you are my best friends.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.736
l'd hoped that the poker game
would help calm my nerves,

11:52.812 --> 11:54.677
so that l could get
a decent night's sleep

11:54.747 --> 11:58.376
before the briefing,
but when l got home that night,

11:58.451 --> 12:01.318
l couldn't keep my mind
off of Voyager.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.821
l needed to get back
to the holodeck.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.122
That feels so good.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.063
Therapeutic massage
can be an effective treatment

12:13.132 --> 12:14.565
for insomnia, Lieutenant.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.295
But we need to get to the cause
of your sleeplessness

12:17.403 --> 12:19.871
if we're going to find
a more permanent solution.

12:19.972 --> 12:23.169
lt's just that every time
l-l close my eyes,

12:23.242 --> 12:25.073
my mind starts to race.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.702
Can you be more specific?

12:26.779 --> 12:28.644
Well, l worry about the project.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.239
Have l explored the problem
from every angle,

12:31.317 --> 12:34.150
or is there something else
l should be trying?

12:34.220 --> 12:35.653
Am l doing enough?

12:35.721 --> 12:37.518
Hmm.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.080
Acute work-related anxiety.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.183
Perhaps l should speak
to the Captain

12:41.260 --> 12:42.887
about reducing your schedule.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.259
Oh, something tells me

12:44.330 --> 12:46.389
she's not going to be able
to help.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.160
You are an invaluable

12:48.267 --> 12:51.100
member of this
crew, Mr. Barclay.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.262
Thank you, Doctor.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.236
lt's nice to be appreciated.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.398
Hmm.

12:56.642 --> 12:57.734
Oh!

13:00.079 --> 13:01.307
Turning in, Reg?

13:01.380 --> 13:02.540
Yes, sir.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.775
Hey, Reg.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.443
For some reason,
l never slept in my apartment

13:06.519 --> 13:11.354
as comfortably as l did
in my holographic quarters.

13:11.423 --> 13:15.325
l suppose
l felt more at home on Voyager.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.362
Mm-hmm.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.410
Good morning, everyone.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.676
Morning, Reg.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.944
You're awfully chipper.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.449
Ah... slept like a baby.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.316
Then maybe you've got
the energy to whip up

13:42.388 --> 13:43.946
one of your famous
cheese omelets.

13:44.089 --> 13:45.579
Oh, yeah. l'm starved.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.354
l'm sorry, guys. l have a very
important briefing at 0900.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.758
Just have time for coffee.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.490
Uh, don't forget
about tonight.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.589
Uh... remind me.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.826
You were supposed to teach me

13:54.900 --> 13:55.958
how to play velocity.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.227
No. No way.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.963
Reg and l have
a hoverball game scheduled.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.002
Don't fight.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.870
Plenty of me to go around.

14:01.941 --> 14:05.138
Reg... l'm sorry
to bother you again,

14:05.211 --> 14:06.269
but l'm
still having trouble

14:06.345 --> 14:07.642
with the warp core
recalibration.

14:07.713 --> 14:08.805
lt's no problem.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.371
l'll stop by Engineering later
and talk you through it.

14:10.449 --> 14:11.381
Thank you.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.884
l really appreciate it.

14:13.986 --> 14:17.581
Velocity, hoverball,
warp core recalibrations?

14:17.656 --> 14:20.124
Reg, l don't know
how you do it.

14:20.192 --> 14:23.184
Let you in on a little secret.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.093
There's two of me.

14:27.800 --> 14:32.032
The Delta Quadrant,
Sector 417 51, Grid 9.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.901
Voyager's Doctor reported this
as the ship's position

14:34.974 --> 14:37.238
when his program was
briefly transferred

14:37.309 --> 14:39.072
to Starfleet two years ago.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.112
Assuming they're still
on course for Earth,

14:41.180 --> 14:42.545
we've been able to extrapolate

14:42.615 --> 14:44.708
a range of likely
trajectories.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.650
Estimating an average
warp speed of 6.2

14:47.720 --> 14:50.883
and accounting for various
astronomical obstacles...

14:55.527 --> 14:57.188
we can reasonably assume
that Voyager

14:57.263 --> 14:59.424
is now in one of
these three sectors.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.523
Can we contact them?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.693
As you know, we've been
working with the Vulcans

15:03.769 --> 15:05.737
on the deployment
of the MlDAS Array.

15:07.773 --> 15:09.968
Though we're still
in the testing phase, we think

15:10.042 --> 15:12.374
it won't be long before we
can use this technology

15:12.444 --> 15:15.106
to send signals at
hyper-subspace speeds.

15:15.180 --> 15:18.206
A message that would
normally take years

15:18.284 --> 15:20.650
to reach its destination
could be received

15:20.719 --> 15:22.277
by Voyager
in a matter of days.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.254
lmpressive.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.314
Will they be able to respond?

15:26.392 --> 15:28.121
No, sir,

15:28.193 --> 15:30.354
but at least they'll know
we're still looking

15:30.429 --> 15:31.589
for them.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.188
We'll send data

15:33.265 --> 15:34.892
on the hyper-subspace
technology

15:35.034 --> 15:36.899
and hope they can
eventually use it

15:37.002 --> 15:37.991
to return the call.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.128
Excuse me, Admiral Paris.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.866
Lieutenant Barclay...

15:41.974 --> 15:43.373
l-l'm sorry, Commander.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.910
lt's just that there may be
a way to establish, uh,

15:46.078 --> 15:47.841
two-way communication
with Voyager.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.710
Now is not the time.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.216
lt's all right, Mr. Harkins.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.911
Let the man speak.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.613
l'm all ears, son.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.622
Well, um...

15:59.491 --> 16:02.289
Well, you see, there's a, uh,

16:02.394 --> 16:05.591
a class-B
itinerant, uh, pulsar

16:05.631 --> 16:10.830
uh, and... well-well,
as you probably know, s-sir,

16:11.003 --> 16:14.131
uh, neutrino emissions, uh...

16:14.239 --> 16:15.171
oh.

16:15.240 --> 16:20.075
What l mean to say is

16:20.145 --> 16:26.175
that with the Array,
we could open an artificial

16:26.251 --> 16:31.518
uh, uh... a... sing...
a sing, uh, sing-singularity.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.887
A wormhole?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.893
Yes! Yes, sir.

16:36.028 --> 16:40.897
We could use it as a conduit
to-to talk to Voyager.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.728
l can't give you high marks
for clarity, Lieutenant,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.462
but you've certainly got
my attention.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.265
ls there any merit
to what he's saying?

16:46.372 --> 16:50.274
Mr. Barclay has a tendency
to get ahead of himself, sir.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.936
Unfortunately,
what he's suggesting

16:53.012 --> 16:54.479
is beyond our abilities.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.070
But you haven't even...

16:56.148 --> 16:56.944
Mr. Barclay!

16:57.082 --> 16:58.674
l know that l haven't

16:58.751 --> 17:00.116
explained myself, uh, very well,

17:00.185 --> 17:01.584
but with all due respect, sir,

17:01.653 --> 17:04.588
what do we have
to lose by trying?

17:04.656 --> 17:10.720
l think we're forgetting
that there are 150 people

17:10.796 --> 17:13.731
stranded in the Delta Quadrant.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.563
l have a son
on that ship, Lieutenant.

17:16.667 --> 17:20.434
l haven't forgotten that fact
for a single moment.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.303
l'm sorry, sir.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.398
l-l didn't, uh...
l didn't mean to...

17:24.510 --> 17:26.410
Take the rest of
the day off, Reg.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.502
But...

17:27.579 --> 17:29.740
That was not a suggestion.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.854
How did you deal
with your feelings afterwards?

17:43.929 --> 17:45.191
What do you mean?

17:45.264 --> 17:48.062
Well... did you talk
to Commander Harkins

17:48.167 --> 17:50.260
after the meeting...
apologize?

17:50.369 --> 17:52.599
Well... no.

17:52.704 --> 17:56.401
l wanted to, uh,
fine tune my plan

17:56.475 --> 18:00.502
so, l-l just went
right back to work.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.103
Be more specific.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.342
What exactly did you do?

18:04.416 --> 18:05.508
Well, l...

18:05.584 --> 18:07.814
needed someone to, uh...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.683
bounce ideas off of,

18:09.755 --> 18:11.814
someone to help focus
my thoughts.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.186
Sounds reasonable.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.953
l suppose you... consulted

18:15.027 --> 18:17.655
with some of your
Pathfinder colleagues.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.323
Well...

18:20.399 --> 18:23.266
not exactly.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.529
You went back to the holodeck,
didn't you?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.537
They're the only people
that l can talk to.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.971
They're not people.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.975
l know...

18:31.043 --> 18:33.671
but they...
they help me with my work.

18:33.745 --> 18:37.545
Poker, massages...

18:37.616 --> 18:39.550
sleeping in
holographic quarters?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.677
Sounds more like escape
than work.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.153
l can't concentrate
if l'm not relaxed.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.191
Can't you relax
with your friends?

18:46.258 --> 18:47.885
''Friends''?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.760
Commander Harkins invited you
to his home.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.822
You went
to the holodeck instead.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.232
lt's not what you're thinking,
Deanna.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.930
This isn't a relapse
of my holo-addiction.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.006
Okay.

19:03.075 --> 19:07.307
Tell me how the holograms
helped you with your work.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.212
Well, l talked to them
about my ideas.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.716
l worked out
technical problems.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.150
l need specifics here, people.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.279
Take us through it again,
Mr. Barclay,

19:17.356 --> 19:18.414
one step at a time.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.515
Maybe it'll spark an idea.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.719
We've got our itinerant pulsar.

19:22.794 --> 19:26.161
We've got our interdimensional
transponder array.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.028
How do we get
our wormhole?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.567
This one could keep
us up all night.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.764
Oh. We know we can produce
gravimetric energy,

19:33.872 --> 19:37.069
but... can we do it
at levels high enough

19:37.142 --> 19:39.201
to create the singularity?

19:39.278 --> 19:40.370
We're talking

19:40.445 --> 19:42.538
about a massive
subspace reaction.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.879
Maybe... that's the problem.

19:45.984 --> 19:47.576
Reg?

19:47.653 --> 19:50.087
Maybe we need
to think smaller.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.089
You're losing me.

19:52.157 --> 19:55.183
How much bandwidth
do we really need?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.353
The average wormhole is huge,

19:57.429 --> 20:00.262
but if we compressed
the datastream...

20:00.332 --> 20:03.096
We wouldn't need a conduit
anywhere near as big.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.726
What's your idea?

20:06.538 --> 20:10.167
A micro-wormhole.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.210
lmpressive.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.541
You've outdone yourself
this time, Reg.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.945
l'll still need, um...
help with the details.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.812
Put together a team.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.318
Use whatever
resources you need.

20:23.956 --> 20:27.483
A power ratio

20:27.559 --> 20:30.926
of approximately
60 terawatts

20:30.996 --> 20:32.224
should do the trick.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.229
You think that's enough?

20:33.298 --> 20:36.665
Should be, but then,
we have to compensate

20:36.768 --> 20:38.167
for gravimetric interference.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.568
And how do we do that?

20:39.638 --> 20:40.832
l was thinking--

20:40.939 --> 20:43.100
what if we applied
a narrowband filter

20:43.175 --> 20:44.733
to the transponder signal?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.003
Barclay strikes again.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.773
What's going on here?

20:49.848 --> 20:51.110
Commander...

20:51.183 --> 20:52.309
Who's your friend, Reg?

20:52.384 --> 20:54.375
Yes, aren't you going
to introduce me?

20:54.453 --> 20:55.943
Computer, delete characters.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.423
l thought l told you
to go home.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.561
l was, uh... working.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.860
You call this work?

21:06.932 --> 21:12.302
You've created holograms
of the Voyager crew.

21:12.371 --> 21:14.999
Oh, it-it... it-it's
not what you think.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.167
lt's an interactive,
uh, diagnostic program.

21:18.243 --> 21:21.235
l designed it to help
me... solve problems.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.713
How long have you been in here?

21:25.050 --> 21:26.415
Since the briefing.

21:26.485 --> 21:28.419
The briefing ended
ten hours ago.

21:31.223 --> 21:34.522
l... l know
that l embarrassed you

21:34.593 --> 21:36.925
in front of the Admiral

21:36.995 --> 21:39.190
and l am... l'm sorry.

21:39.264 --> 21:40.959
l wanted to refine my idea,

21:41.033 --> 21:42.864
so that l could present you

21:42.934 --> 21:45.368
with a specific plan,
and l've done that, Pete.

21:45.437 --> 21:46.597
You were right

21:46.705 --> 21:48.639
about the wormhole idea
being too expansive.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.265
So, l've-l've scaled it back...

21:50.375 --> 21:53.606
All the extra time
you've been putting in--

21:53.679 --> 21:55.943
if l checked the holo-logs,

21:56.014 --> 21:58.574
would l find
you've been spending

21:58.650 --> 22:00.117
those hours in here?

22:00.185 --> 22:04.747
Well, not-not all that time.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.552
How much of it?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.889
Maybe, uh...

22:09.995 --> 22:11.587
20 or...

22:11.663 --> 22:13.893
30 hours a week.

22:14.032 --> 22:16.023
Don't you think
that's a little excessive?

22:16.134 --> 22:19.900
Uh, not if it helps us
contact Voyager.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.942
Before l brought you
onto my team...

22:26.044 --> 22:28.308
l reviewed your file.

22:28.380 --> 22:32.680
You've struggled
with holo-addiction before.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.482
From where l stand,

22:36.555 --> 22:39.080
it looks like
you've had a relapse.

22:39.157 --> 22:42.149
l-l know it-it may look
that way, but...

22:42.227 --> 22:43.455
l think you need counseling.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.120
What l need is

22:45.197 --> 22:47.859
for you to pay attention
to my ideas.

22:49.935 --> 22:54.395
l should've been paying more
attention to your behavior.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.872
l thought l was being a friend

22:56.942 --> 22:58.933
by giving you some leeway.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.841
l didn't realize how...

23:00.946 --> 23:03.813
involved you've
become with Voyager.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.441
Well, is it really so wrong?

23:05.517 --> 23:08.577
Do you have any idea
what it must be like for them

23:08.653 --> 23:10.780
to be stranded
60,000 light-years

23:10.856 --> 23:12.118
from home?

23:12.190 --> 23:17.025
Do you have any idea...
how lonely that must be?

23:17.095 --> 23:19.029
l'm sorry, Reg...

23:19.097 --> 23:23.659
but until you get some help,
you're off the project.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.794
You-you can't do that.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.395
You've given me no choice.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.941
This hologrid and the lab

23:31.042 --> 23:33.738
are officially off limits.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.474
Now, go home.

23:36.548 --> 23:37.947
l won't leave--

23:38.049 --> 23:40.745
not until you've heard
what l have to say.

23:40.819 --> 23:41.877
Reg!

23:44.489 --> 23:47.754
Don't make me call Security.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.773
What is it, Nicole?

24:04.843 --> 24:06.504
He's still here.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.046
You told him l have
a meeting scheduled at 1500?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.138
Yes, sir.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.341
He won't go away.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.180
Send him in.

24:14.252 --> 24:15.742
Yes, sir.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.824
Admiral, uh,
th-thank, thank you,

24:20.892 --> 24:22.120
uh, for seeing me.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.628
You're frightening
my secretary, Mr. Barclay.

24:24.696 --> 24:26.061
You have five minutes.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.863
Five minutes, right?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.163
Sit down.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.241
Uh, first... first,
l-l-l want to apologize

24:37.309 --> 24:39.800
for speaking out of turn
yesterday.

24:39.911 --> 24:41.242
l-it's only because l...

24:41.313 --> 24:43.406
l, l care so much
about Voyager.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.313
Yes, Commander Harkins
has informed me

24:45.383 --> 24:47.112
about your attachment
to the crew.

24:47.185 --> 24:49.176
l understand
you've been spending time

24:49.254 --> 24:52.155
with a holographic re-creation
of my son, among others.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.215
Frankly, l find that

24:54.292 --> 24:56.226
rather disturbing.

24:56.294 --> 24:59.127
Well, l understand
h-how you could see it that way,

24:59.197 --> 25:02.360
but, uh, that does not negate
the fact that l have a plan

25:02.467 --> 25:04.230
for communicating with Voyager.

25:04.336 --> 25:08.204
Commander Harkins doesn't seem
to think your plan is viable.

25:08.273 --> 25:10.537
l have refined the idea.

25:10.609 --> 25:12.076
l've simplified it.

25:12.143 --> 25:13.269
All l'm asking for

25:13.345 --> 25:14.869
is a chance to try.

25:15.013 --> 25:19.109
And if l'm right, it could mean
a chance to talk to Tom.

25:23.388 --> 25:27.324
ln my opinion, Commander Harkins
removed you from the project

25:27.392 --> 25:30.190
with good cause,
and that's his prerogative.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.355
l won't let my personal feelings

25:32.430 --> 25:34.295
interfere
with Starfleet procedure.

25:38.103 --> 25:42.039
l... l've broken protocol
and l should be punished,

25:42.140 --> 25:44.870
but the crew
of the Voyager shouldn't be

25:44.943 --> 25:47.275
and neither...
neither should you.

25:47.345 --> 25:49.779
l just need access
to the lab

25:49.848 --> 25:51.509
for one more day.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.244
After that, if l...

25:53.318 --> 25:54.717
uh, if l'm wrong,

25:54.786 --> 25:57.482
l'll resign my commission.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.617
l'll order a review
of your findings.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.821
lf it's concluded
your ideas are valid,

26:04.896 --> 26:07.296
l'll instruct Commander Harkins
to pursue it.

26:07.365 --> 26:08.957
But... l'm
the one who knows...

26:09.034 --> 26:11.628
That's the best
l can do, Mr. Barclay.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.203
Good day.

26:18.643 --> 26:21.544
So the meeting went well.

26:21.613 --> 26:24.275
No, no, no.
lt didn't, not at all.

26:24.349 --> 26:25.748
The Admiral said

26:25.817 --> 26:27.717
he'd review your findings.

26:27.786 --> 26:28.810
Don't you see?

26:28.887 --> 26:30.684
He was just trying
to get rid of me

26:30.755 --> 26:31.847
just like Harkins.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.117
Try to relax.

26:33.191 --> 26:36.092
Now you understand
why l need your help.

26:36.161 --> 26:37.890
Yes, l do.

26:38.029 --> 26:40.156
You-you have to call the Admiral

26:40.231 --> 26:42.893
in your official capacity
as a Starfleet Counselor

26:43.068 --> 26:45.093
and tell him that
l am psychologically fit

26:45.203 --> 26:46.192
to return to work.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.940
l can't do that.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.636
Why not?!

26:53.712 --> 26:54.940
Look at yourself.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.811
You're experiencing
acute anxiety,

26:57.882 --> 26:59.144
sleeplessness,

26:59.217 --> 27:00.206
paranoia.

27:00.318 --> 27:01.808
You did what you could.

27:01.853 --> 27:06.017
Now it's time to let Starfleet
worry about Voyager.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.389
We need to take care of you.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.190
There is nothing
wrong with me!

27:11.262 --> 27:13.958
You said yourself, you've become

27:14.032 --> 27:15.829
obsessed with Voyager.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.332
What if l have?

27:17.435 --> 27:20.131
lf an obsession helps me
to do my job better,

27:20.238 --> 27:22.604
i-it's a sacrifice
l am willing to make.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.541
A little instability
in exchange for contact

27:25.610 --> 27:27.874
with a stranded starship.

27:28.013 --> 27:29.412
lsn't Voyager
more important

27:29.481 --> 27:31.142
than my
psychological condition?

27:31.216 --> 27:35.084
Voyager is important,
but so are you.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.018
That ship...

27:43.261 --> 27:45.229
that crew...

27:48.500 --> 27:50.866
they're all l have.

27:56.741 --> 27:58.936
Tell me why that is.

27:59.077 --> 28:03.810
Ever... ever since
l-l left the Enterprise,

28:03.915 --> 28:07.817
things haven't...
haven't been the same.

28:07.952 --> 28:11.012
lt's as if...

28:15.126 --> 28:17.287
l lost my family.

28:17.362 --> 28:22.925
So you created a new family
on the holodeck.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.525
Only they're not real.

28:25.637 --> 28:29.232
l didn't know how else...

28:29.340 --> 28:31.274
how else to cope.

28:34.312 --> 28:37.645
Do you remember when you first
came aboard the Enterprise?

28:37.716 --> 28:40.412
You had trouble
fitting in, didn't you?

28:40.485 --> 28:46.515
But after a while, you
started to make friends.

28:46.591 --> 28:49.719
You can learn to do
the same thing here on Earth.

28:49.794 --> 28:53.321
Oh, l... l don't know how.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.764
We'll work on it together.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.365
You're, you're scheduled
to depart tomorrow.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.100
l've decided
to ask Captain Picard

29:03.208 --> 29:05.802
for a temporary
leave of absence...

29:05.910 --> 29:09.812
to spend some time
with an old friend.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.678
Oh, Deanna, you...
you-you, you don't,

29:11.750 --> 29:13.047
you don't have to do that.

29:13.118 --> 29:16.315
Try and stop me.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.666
l'm sorry, Neelix.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.001
l have to leave.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.237
No, no,
you can't talk me out of it.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.320
Authorization code required.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.017
Barclay-alpha-one-seven-gamma.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.354

29:55.426 --> 29:57.758

Computer, reenter

30:14.712 --> 30:17.943

Barclay-alpha-one-seven-gamma.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.614
Access authorized.

30:41.806 --> 30:44.969
Computer, interface
with the MlDAS Array.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.153
Activate the control matrix.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.787
Matrix activated.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.129
Full power
to the graviton emitters.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.668
Emitters powering.

31:11.736 --> 31:14.170
Scan the area
surrounding the Array

31:14.239 --> 31:16.503
for a class-B itinerant pulsar.

31:16.574 --> 31:20.840
A pulsar has been detected
at coordinates 227 by 41 mark 6.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.846
Good, good.

31:22.914 --> 31:28.511
Direct a 60 terawatt
tachyon beam toward the pulsar.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.850
Tachyon beam initiated.

31:30.922 --> 31:34.949
How long
until levels are sufficient

31:35.026 --> 31:41.522
to produce a gravimetric surge
of five million teradynes?

31:41.599 --> 31:44.568
Approximately 17 minutes.

31:47.639 --> 31:51.905
Computer, is there
a micro-wormhole present

31:51.976 --> 31:54.501
at coordinates 343 by 27?

31:54.579 --> 31:56.046
Scanning.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.849
Affirmative.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.113
l knew it.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.484
Adjust the phase alignment

32:04.522 --> 32:07.116
to direct
the wormhole's trajectory

32:07.191 --> 32:11.457
to Delta Quadrant, Grid 9,
Sector 417 51.

32:11.529 --> 32:14.123
Trajectory established.

32:14.198 --> 32:17.292
Open Starfleet Emergency Channel

32:17.402 --> 32:20.838
and transmit

32:22.073 --> 32:23.938
Channel open.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.509
Starfleet Command
to USS Voyager.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.044
Come in, Voyager.

32:29.914 --> 32:33.509
Voyager, do you hear me?

32:33.584 --> 32:36.985
This is
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.

32:38.022 --> 32:41.253
Step away from the controls.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.191
Pete.

32:43.261 --> 32:45.229
l... l've sent a message.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.498
Stand down, Mr. Barclay.

32:51.569 --> 32:53.036
All right.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.969
You win.

32:58.042 --> 32:59.509
Computer...

32:59.577 --> 33:01.306
transfer controls
to hologrid

33:01.412 --> 33:02.902
program Barclay pi-three

33:03.014 --> 33:04.481
and restrict access!

33:04.549 --> 33:05.811
Stop him.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.714
Stun him if you have to.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.228
Tuvok, did you
see those two men?

33:24.335 --> 33:25.461
l did not.

33:25.570 --> 33:26.832
Well, they look like
Starfleet Security,

33:26.938 --> 33:27.905
but they're not.

33:27.972 --> 33:28.904
lntruders?

33:28.973 --> 33:30.463
They're after me.
l need your help.

33:30.575 --> 33:31.837
Tuvok to all hands.

33:31.909 --> 33:33.171
lntruder alert.

33:33.244 --> 33:35.838
Computer, locate
any unauthorized personnel

33:35.913 --> 33:37.505

33:50.261 --> 33:52.593
We've been isolated
by force fields.

33:52.663 --> 33:54.460
Can you shut down the program?

33:54.532 --> 33:55.999
l'm working on it.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.612
What's going on?

34:16.687 --> 34:18.382
l'm just trying
to help some friends.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.388
ls there a response?

34:19.456 --> 34:20.549
Negative.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.217
Computer, redirect

34:22.293 --> 34:23.260
Reg!

34:24.529 --> 34:26.053
You'll have to
come with me, sir.

We've lost him, sir.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.588
l've got an idea.

34:57.662 --> 34:59.129
l'm coming in.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.425
l know you.

35:04.535 --> 35:05.763
You're Reg's friend.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.132
You've got something to do

35:07.238 --> 35:09.069
with what's going on here,
don't you?

35:09.140 --> 35:11.199
Computer, disengage
primary coolant system.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.072
Are you crazy? That'll cause

35:13.144 --> 35:15.112
a warp core breach!

35:15.179 --> 35:16.544
Exactly.

35:20.051 --> 35:22.178
Mr. Barclay,
l want an explanation

35:22.253 --> 35:24.483
for what's going on
aboard my ship.

35:24.555 --> 35:26.716
l'm looking after Voyager's
best interests, Captain.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.486
You're just going to have
to trust me on that.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.722
You've never given me
any reason to doubt you before.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.424
Computer, redirect
the wormhole's trajectory

35:34.499 --> 35:36.797
to Delta Quadrant,
Grid 10, Sector 3658

35:36.901 --> 35:38.493
and retransmit the message.

35:38.603 --> 35:43.370
Trajectory established.
Transmitting.

35:43.441 --> 35:44.874
Who are you trying
to contact, Reg?

35:44.942 --> 35:47.877
Warning.
Warp core breach in 45 seconds.

35:47.945 --> 35:50.641
Bridge to Engineering. Report.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.148
Shut down the program, Reg.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.444
Janeway to Security.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.281
lntruders on the Bridge.

35:55.353 --> 35:56.752
Computer,
establish a force field

35:56.821 --> 35:57.947
around the science station.

35:58.055 --> 35:59.784
Warning.
Warp core breach in 30 seconds.

35:59.857 --> 36:01.119
Harry, get down
to Engineering.

36:01.192 --> 36:02.784
Seal that breach.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.055
Force fields aren't going
to help you, Reg. lt's over.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.563
But this is my last chance.

36:07.632 --> 36:09.429
Warp core breach in 20 seconds.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.560
Captain to all hands.
Abandon ship.

36:17.208 --> 36:20.302
Warp core breach in ten seconds.

36:20.378 --> 36:23.506
One way or another,
this program's going to end.

36:23.581 --> 36:26.778
...seven, six...

36:26.851 --> 36:28.113
Good-bye, Captain.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.278
...four...

36:29.353 --> 36:31.218
Computer, end program.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.688
...two...

36:50.541 --> 36:52.805
l'm ready for my lesson.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.072
l've concluded that
teaching you to sing

36:55.146 --> 36:56.943
is an inefficient
use of my time.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.245
But l... l've...
l've been practicing.

37:00.318 --> 37:02.809
ln your case,
practice is irrelevant.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.013
Your vocal chords
are incapable

37:05.089 --> 37:07.421
of producing
basic diatonic tones,

37:07.491 --> 37:10.426
not to mention your
rhythmic shortcomings.

37:10.494 --> 37:13.258
l sound so good
in the sonic shower.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.094
Perhaps you should
confine your efforts

37:15.166 --> 37:16.463
to that location.

37:23.107 --> 37:25.075
Astrometrics to the Bridge.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.803
Go ahead, Seven.

37:26.877 --> 37:29.573
l've detected what appears
to be a micro-wormhole

37:29.647 --> 37:33.174
at coordinates 194.6 by 35.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.082
A micro-wormhole?

37:35.152 --> 37:37.586
l believe a message is being
transmitted through it...

37:40.558 --> 37:43.288
on a Starfleet
Emergency Channel.

37:51.636 --> 37:53.331
Let's hear it, Harry.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.235
Starfleet Command
to USS Voyager.

37:58.042 --> 38:01.102
Try applying a narrowband filter
to the signal processor.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.246
Do you hear me?

38:04.315 --> 38:10.151
This is
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.

38:10.221 --> 38:11.654
That's it.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.212
Whoever this Barclay is,

38:13.291 --> 38:15.020
he stopped transmitting.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.754
The micro-wormhole is collapsing

38:17.828 --> 38:19.693
at a rate of .2 percent
per second.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.994
That doesn't give us much time.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.328
To do what?

38:23.401 --> 38:24.993
To send a message
back through

38:25.102 --> 38:27.070
and hope Mr. Barclay
is listening.

38:30.207 --> 38:31.231
lt should have worked.

38:31.342 --> 38:33.037
l don't understand
why it didn't.

38:34.545 --> 38:36.012
There you are.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.877
l've reviewed
Mr. Barclay's plan.

38:38.015 --> 38:39.880
l think it's
worth an attempt.

38:39.950 --> 38:42.714
He's already tried, sir,
without your authorization.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.220
lt didn't work.

38:44.288 --> 38:46.449
l'm sorry to hear that.

38:46.524 --> 38:47.616
So am l, sir.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.455
l appreciate
your confidence in me,

38:49.527 --> 38:51.085
but l... l don't deserve it.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.528
What would you like me
to do with him, Admiral?

38:53.597 --> 38:55.997
He broke into the lab,
accessed the MlDAS Array,

38:56.067 --> 38:57.500
resisted arrest.

38:57.601 --> 39:00.229
You've put me
in a difficult position, son.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.670
l was hoping
that we'd be able to...

39:04.108 --> 39:05.507
We're receiving

39:05.576 --> 39:06.804
a transmission.

39:06.944 --> 39:07.808
From where?

39:07.945 --> 39:09.435
Coordinates 343.6

39:09.513 --> 39:10.775
by 27.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.110
The wormhole.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.413
Starfleet Command, come in.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.817
Voyager.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.254
Reg, give me a hand
clearing up the signal.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.822
Lower the filter band
by .3 kilohertz.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.829
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.

39:26.897 --> 39:28.330
Do you read me?

39:28.399 --> 39:30.993
l think she's talking to you.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.592
Captain...

39:32.703 --> 39:36.867
this is
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay

39:36.941 --> 39:39.535
at Starfleet Command.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.374
lt's good to hear
your voice, Lieutenant.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.437
We've been waiting a long time

39:44.515 --> 39:46.142
for this moment.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.707
The feeling is mutual.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.810
Unfortunately, the
micro-wormhole is collapsing.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.479
We have only a few moments.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.886
Understood.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.982
We are transmitting
our ship's logs, crew reports,

39:56.060 --> 39:58.324
and navigational records
to you now.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.489
Acknowledged,
and we're sending you

40:00.564 --> 40:03.590
data on some new
hyper-subspace technology.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.396
We're hoping, eventually,
to use it

40:05.503 --> 40:07.733
to keep in regular contact,
and we're including some

40:07.838 --> 40:10.272
recommended modifications
for your com system.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.707
We'll implement them
as soon as possible.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.836
Uh, there's someone else here

40:14.912 --> 40:17.972
who would also
like to say something.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.681
This is Admiral Paris.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.185
Hello, sir.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.949
How are your people holding up?

40:25.055 --> 40:26.454
Very well.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.618
They're an exemplary crew,

40:29.693 --> 40:31.661
your son included.

40:32.730 --> 40:36.359
Tell him... tell him l miss him,

40:36.467 --> 40:39.231
and l'm proud of him.

40:39.336 --> 40:42.328
He heard you, Admiral.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.873
The wormhole is collapsing.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.171
l want you all to know
we're doing everything we can

40:46.243 --> 40:47.210
to bring you home.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.212
We appreciate it, sir.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.407
Keep a docking bay open for us.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.779
We hope to...

40:54.518 --> 40:57.487
That's it. They're gone.

40:59.023 --> 41:00.786
You did it, Reg.

41:00.891 --> 41:03.257
l'm sorry l doubted you.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.695
Why the long face, Mr. Barclay?

41:08.766 --> 41:14.102
Because...
because it's over, sir.

41:14.171 --> 41:17.436
No, Lieutenant.

41:17.508 --> 41:21.604
l'd say that Project Voyager
is just beginning...

41:21.679 --> 41:23.271
thanks to you.

41:35.025 --> 41:36.959
Anyone know this Barclay?

41:37.027 --> 41:38.289
l took the liberty

41:38.362 --> 41:40.125
of reviewing
his personnel file.

41:40.197 --> 41:41.960
He's had a rather
colorful career,

41:42.099 --> 41:44.431
not to mention an
unusual medical history.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.765
He's recovered
from a variety of maladies

41:46.871 --> 41:48.395
including transporter phobia

41:48.506 --> 41:49.734
and holo-addiction.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.898
Well, whatever his problems,

41:51.008 --> 41:52.566
he certainly came through
for us.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.610
Starfleet should
give him a promotion.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.111
l've finished
analyzing the data

41:56.180 --> 41:57.340
Mr. Barclay sent.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.405
The hyper-subspace
technology is promising.

41:59.483 --> 42:00.780
l believe
we can look forward

42:00.885 --> 42:02.580
to future communications
with Earth.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.053
Well, that calls for a toast.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.952
Care to do the honors, Tom?

42:08.459 --> 42:11.587
To... my dad.

42:11.662 --> 42:13.027
lt's nice to know

42:13.097 --> 42:14.564
he's still there.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.896
And to the newest
honorary member

42:17.001 --> 42:18.298
of the Voyager crew,

42:18.402 --> 42:20.802
Reginald Barclay,
whoever you are.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.099
Hear, hear.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.673
To Mr. Barclay.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.641
Congratulations.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.110
Well, l'm not... not sure
l deserve congratulations.

42:29.179 --> 42:30.441
Why not?

42:30.514 --> 42:31.947
lt's quite an accomplishment.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.847
l, l couldn't have done it
without your help.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.943
Why did Commander Harkins
have to say about it?

42:36.020 --> 42:38.580
Well, l think...
l think he was pleased.

42:38.656 --> 42:39.816
Why wouldn't he be?

42:39.890 --> 42:41.187
You're quite a catch.

42:41.258 --> 42:43.852
Well, not everyone
would want his sister-in-law

42:43.928 --> 42:45.759
to date someone with my history.

42:45.829 --> 42:48.229
lt's a new era.

42:48.299 --> 42:51.268
So, tell me
all about the lucky lady.

42:51.335 --> 42:52.734
l want details.

42:52.803 --> 42:57.001
Well, her name is Hope.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.132
You're kidding.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.233
No, and-and-and...

43:00.344 --> 43:02.642
she loves cats.
