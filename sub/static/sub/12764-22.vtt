00:00.999 --> 00:02.864
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.901 --> 00:06.064
- Will you go to the prom with me?
- I would love to go with you.

00:06.104 --> 00:09.596
I have less than four weeks to
plan a theme, decorations, food...

00:09.641 --> 00:10.835
- Ouch.
- Bummer.

00:10.875 --> 00:12.570
You'll wow me with the lyrics.

00:12.610 --> 00:15.579
- In exchange for...
- I DJ the prom.

00:15.613 --> 00:19.105
I'd hate to see you blow off Declan
for a taste of college boy pie.

00:19.184 --> 00:22.584
Neither of us meet anyone by prom,
we can finish what we started.

00:22.619 --> 00:24.211
- Yeah?
- Totally.

00:24.254 --> 00:27.052
My test results are back.
I'm in remission!

00:29.026 --> 00:31.722
I have to find her.
I have to know who this woman is.

00:31.762 --> 00:34.822
- Ryan told me about Sarah.
- You don't know how she died.

00:34.865 --> 00:37.197
She was like you,
trying too much too fast.

00:37.234 --> 00:39.828
Something she wasn't
ready for killed her.

00:39.870 --> 00:42.737
I don't know why Taylor's pushing,
but you need to stop.

00:42.773 --> 00:44.536
Prove to Latnok that we matter.

00:44.575 --> 00:46.634
Jessi, please don't listen to him.

00:46.677 --> 00:49.407
What am I supposed to do?
He's my father.

00:49.446 --> 00:51.607
Someone is sending Kyle a message.

00:51.648 --> 00:54.116
- I thought Sarah was dead.
- She is.

00:54.151 --> 00:57.018
- Maybe she wants me to find her.
- Hello.

00:57.054 --> 00:59.852
- I'm Kyle.
- My name is Sarah.

01:01.492 --> 01:05.723
<i>Life is a journey, and the road
we travel has twists and turns</i>

01:05.762 --> 01:10.495
<i>which sometimes lead us to unexpected
places and unexpected people.</i>

01:10.533 --> 01:13.366
It's amazing how much
you look like Adam.

01:13.403 --> 01:15.837
You haven't told him
about us meeting tonight.

01:15.872 --> 01:19.638
Adam knows about the messages,
but I never mentioned them to Jessi.

01:20.209 --> 01:21.233
Good.

01:23.379 --> 01:25.074
They think about you a lot.

01:27.383 --> 01:29.851
Yes, well.

01:30.653 --> 01:33.019
I want you to understand.

01:33.056 --> 01:35.923
Brian Taylor has always been
a true believer in Latnok.

01:35.958 --> 01:39.291
By showing off Jessi's abilities,
he thinks they'll let him in,

01:39.328 --> 01:42.456
- even if she's harmed.
- Adam explained that to me.

01:42.498 --> 01:46.867
I'm sure Adam's explanation
preserved his belief

01:46.903 --> 01:49.029
in Latnok's noble intentions.

01:50.005 --> 01:52.496
- Aren't they?
- What Adam told you wasn't wrong.

01:52.541 --> 01:54.133
People in Latnok aren't bad.

01:54.176 --> 01:57.270
They're simply scientists
with a clinical point of view.

01:57.312 --> 02:00.713
To them everything's
about numbers, facts, hypotheses.

02:00.749 --> 02:03.616
Nothing's personal.
But I took it personally.

02:03.652 --> 02:07.315
- That's why you disappeared.
- To have a life.

02:07.355 --> 02:10.916
To be free to make my own choices,
which is what you and Jessi deserve.

02:10.959 --> 02:14.520
- But Jessi wants this.
- Because she doesn't know any better.

02:15.630 --> 02:18.565
Taylor cares about Latnok,
he doesn't care about Jessi.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.534
He sees her as an achievement.

02:20.569 --> 02:24.471
If he pushes her too far and she breaks
down, such is the cost of science.

02:24.506 --> 02:29.705
She's just a means to an end.
You have to make her see it, Kyle.

02:29.744 --> 02:32.803
You have to get through
to her before it's too late.

02:32.847 --> 02:35.577
- You could get through to her.
- No.

02:36.484 --> 02:38.452
Don't tell her about me.

02:39.086 --> 02:41.577
But how will I find you?

02:41.622 --> 02:44.819
You won't. I'll find you.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.501 --> 02:56.902
Um, I wasn't able to finish
the protocol within the time limit,

02:56.937 --> 02:59.838
- but I'll do it tomorrow.
- Don't bother.

02:59.874 --> 03:01.933
I can do it.
I just have to stay focused.

03:01.976 --> 03:05.309
Jess, you're done training.
You're ready now.

03:06.947 --> 03:10.474
- I am?
- I set up a meeting with Latnok.

03:35.041 --> 03:38.169
- That's how you're starting your day?
- I spent last night

03:38.211 --> 03:40.839
listening to Lori battle
with a guitar and lose...

03:40.880 --> 03:42.814
- It wasn't that bad.
- Yes, it was.

03:42.849 --> 03:46.216
- What was?
- We heard you working on your song.

03:46.252 --> 03:47.810
How's it coming?

03:47.854 --> 03:51.517
Blocked. I think I need an inspirational
cup of teen angst at The Rack.

03:51.558 --> 03:54.459
- That's today's special.
- What are you talking about?

03:54.494 --> 03:58.623
Nothing says prom like watching fellow
students blow their life savings

03:58.664 --> 04:02.100
planning a crass,
meaningless ritual of adolescence

04:02.134 --> 04:05.467
the sole purpose of which is to indulge
in underage drinking,

04:05.504 --> 04:08.871
promiscuity
and unrealistic expectations.

04:08.907 --> 04:11.569
- Declan.
- You don't sound blocked to me.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.202
I didn't know prom cost money.

04:13.245 --> 04:16.271
- 1,900 bucks and counting.
- No way.

04:16.315 --> 04:20.183
200 for the tickets, 300 for the limo,
another 150 for dinner,

04:20.219 --> 04:22.278
then a thousand for the suite...

04:25.791 --> 04:28.316
For the sweet afterparty.

04:28.360 --> 04:31.591
- Lots of punch and chips.
- Nice save.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.655
Not to sound too mom or anything,

04:33.699 --> 04:36.065
you don't break the bank
to have a great time.

04:36.101 --> 04:39.866
Thanks, Mrs. Trager.
And no "mom" offense taken.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.431
OK, you ready?
We gotta go. See you later.

04:46.744 --> 04:50.771
So, who signed up for
the Declan prom extravaganza?

04:52.016 --> 04:54.280
Um, tux fitting's at 10. Ready to go?

04:54.318 --> 04:56.718
Actually,
I have to take care of something.

04:59.824 --> 05:02.122
Avoidance. Interesting.

05:04.228 --> 05:07.322
- Why are you so happy?
- Because I'll be hanging out with Andy

05:07.365 --> 05:10.960
while you go broke watching Prince
Charming with his new Cinderella.

05:11.002 --> 05:12.435
- Drop dead.
- Catchy.

05:12.470 --> 05:15.997
- You should use that in your song.
- It's the title.

05:18.075 --> 05:20.134
Why are proms so expensive?

05:20.177 --> 05:22.770
You want it to mean something,
to be special.

05:22.812 --> 05:25.303
That means thousands
of dollars you don't have?

05:25.348 --> 05:29.307
It's about creating the mood.
Girls want romance and magic.

05:29.352 --> 05:32.583
Romantic is easy.
Magic requires cash.

05:32.622 --> 05:35.614
What if I want to give Amanda magic,
but I don't have money?

05:35.659 --> 05:37.650
Nothing. You're screwed.

05:37.694 --> 05:41.221
- Don't forget to vote.
- You're actively campaigning?

05:41.264 --> 05:44.256
Why leave things to chance,
when I found the perfect date?

05:44.301 --> 05:47.566
- Who's the lucky guy?
- He's round, sparkly,

05:47.604 --> 05:51.062
weighs just the right amount,
and keeps your hair in place.

05:51.107 --> 05:53.439
- You're dating the tiara?
- Yes, munchkin.

05:53.476 --> 05:56.001
Goes with anything,
my dress choices are unlimited.

05:59.516 --> 06:03.509
- Prom queen. Just add crown.
- Wow.

06:03.553 --> 06:08.216
- You really went all out.
- You seem decidedly unfabulous.

06:08.257 --> 06:12.557
Prom committee's a nightmare with the
decorators and arguments with caterers.

06:12.594 --> 06:15.620
I want prom to be the perfect night,
and all I can think about

06:15.664 --> 06:18.155
is table rentals
and nonrefundable deposits.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.964
To top it off, now I'm
getting crap for the prom theme.

06:21.003 --> 06:24.530
- Which is?
- "The Time of Our Lives."

06:26.842 --> 06:30.369
Come on. Patrick Swayze?
"Nobody puts Baby in a corner."

06:30.412 --> 06:32.778
<i>How many times have
you seen Dirty Dancing?</i>

06:32.815 --> 06:35.409
- Thirty-three.
- Oh!

06:35.451 --> 06:38.682
- Poor thing.
- Why does everyone keep saying that?

06:38.721 --> 06:41.019
There are other places we can meet.

06:41.056 --> 06:44.253
Yes. But none that have
your employee discount.

06:44.293 --> 06:48.422
You owe me a buck fifteen. They wouldn't
believe me when I said I was you.

06:48.463 --> 06:50.328
Save money.
Put it towards a tuxedo.

06:50.365 --> 06:51.832
Why, did somebody die?

06:51.866 --> 06:54.858
You don't wear a tuxedo to a funeral,
you wear one to a prom.

06:54.902 --> 06:58.599
Didn't you tell me that going to a
prom would be a fate worse than death?

06:58.639 --> 07:02.632
And then death and I were next-door
neighbors, he moved out of the area...

07:02.677 --> 07:05.510
You are getting that
this is a cancer metaphor, right?

07:05.546 --> 07:07.173
It's a cancer simile.

07:07.215 --> 07:10.776
I also know that neither one of us
is old enough to get into the prom.

07:10.818 --> 07:13.446
That's why mama got Josh
to work out the details,

07:13.488 --> 07:17.219
while I'm off buying
a smoking-hot prom dress.

07:19.527 --> 07:21.154
So, what do you think?

07:23.464 --> 07:28.197
I think that you and the prom
should be required by law

07:28.236 --> 07:31.295
- to stay 100 yards from each other.
- Excuse me?

07:33.173 --> 07:36.574
<i>With crepe paper moon and make-believe
smiles, we'll never forget this sight</i>

07:36.610 --> 07:39.306
<i>Swirling with laughter
and fraudulent tears</i>

07:39.346 --> 07:41.109
<i>Our hollow memory of prom night</i>

07:41.148 --> 07:43.742
I think it captured the mood.

07:43.784 --> 07:46.480
You've annihilated
an innocent ritual.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.786
I'm sorry it doesn't meet your shiny,
happy people musical standards.

07:55.896 --> 07:58.091
I guess I just expected more from you.

08:04.404 --> 08:07.601
- Since when are you working?
- Since when do you drink coffee?

08:07.641 --> 08:09.973
I need to keep awake
until the day after prom.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.375
And I need ducats in a major way.

08:12.411 --> 08:14.276
- You better tip.
- Money? What for?

08:14.313 --> 08:18.044
For that fancy little dance
you're willing to give up sleep over.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.018
You're going to prom?
But you and Andy aren't old enough.

08:21.053 --> 08:24.853
Are you going with someone else?
Did you guys break up? I'm so sorry.

08:24.890 --> 08:29.350
None of that. It's the damn cancer.

08:29.395 --> 08:33.331
I thought we had it beat,
but it's still biting my ass.

08:33.365 --> 08:38.530
Andy, she of hamburgers and hippie
skirts, has decided she wants to go.

08:38.571 --> 08:42.063
Oh. And you wanna make it special.

08:42.107 --> 08:44.337
Andy's like the coolest guy
I've ever known

08:44.376 --> 08:46.003
in a body I get to make out with.

08:46.045 --> 08:48.980
I'm lucky I got her once,
but now that she's not sick,

08:49.014 --> 08:51.175
I feel like I've hit the jackpot again.

08:51.217 --> 08:55.084
I don't care what it takes.
She's getting prom deluxe.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.780
That is so sweet. I wanna help.

08:56.821 --> 08:59.415
First we have to figure out
a way to get you guys in.

08:59.457 --> 09:01.357
Aren't you the head of committee?

09:01.392 --> 09:03.860
I sold you tickets,
you'd never make it past the door,

09:03.895 --> 09:06.193
unless you had an
upperclassman as your date.

09:06.231 --> 09:09.257
And the costs keep rising.

09:11.002 --> 09:14.438
- Bribe decoy prom dates.
- Josh?

09:15.440 --> 09:17.806
I think I might know a couple
who'd do it for free.

09:31.789 --> 09:33.882
Whatever you've come here
to say, don't.

09:33.925 --> 09:35.984
- You'll ruin today for me.
- What's today?

09:38.862 --> 09:42.354
It's happening.
I'm meeting them, Latnok.

09:42.399 --> 09:44.264
They want me to show them
what I can do.

09:44.301 --> 09:47.236
Taylor wants to show them
so he can look good.

09:47.271 --> 09:49.603
Why do you have to say that?
Why'd you come here?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.608
I have the chance to prove
I'm worth something.

09:51.642 --> 09:53.633
You already are.

09:53.677 --> 09:57.044
And you don't have to prove that
to Taylor or Latnok or anyone.

09:58.649 --> 10:00.810
Maybe I need to prove it to myself.

10:01.785 --> 10:03.912
So did Sarah,
and it almost destroyed her.

10:03.954 --> 10:07.583
You're wrong.
No one really knows what happened.

10:07.624 --> 10:08.648
But I do.

10:11.962 --> 10:13.725
Because she told me.

10:19.303 --> 10:22.362
If you don't wanna listen to me,
maybe you'll listen to Sarah.

10:25.942 --> 10:27.409
She's alive.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.987
She's been living alone all these years?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.120
She wanted to escape the pressure,

10:43.159 --> 10:47.061
live some kind of life
other than Latnok's experiment.

10:48.331 --> 10:50.595
But she made everyone think
she was dead.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.328
I'm sure she had her reasons.

10:56.706 --> 10:59.869
Why would she come to you?
Why not me?

10:59.909 --> 11:04.345
She doesn't want anyone
to know she's still alive, even Adam.

11:04.379 --> 11:09.009
- But she wants to meet me, right?
- She wants you to come with me.

11:10.552 --> 11:14.044
- But I'm supposed to go with...
- No, you need to come to my house now.

11:15.423 --> 11:17.220
So I can talk to her?

11:19.127 --> 11:20.958
I'll make sure of it.

11:24.933 --> 11:26.594
OK.

11:31.973 --> 11:35.568
- Does Taylor know Jessi's here?
- No, but he'll start to look for her.

11:35.610 --> 11:37.840
She's supposed to meet
people from Latnok.

11:37.879 --> 11:39.870
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

11:39.914 --> 11:41.939
Their membership is kept secret.

11:41.983 --> 11:45.214
Adam always described them
as great thinkers and humanitarians.

11:45.253 --> 11:48.380
According to Sarah, they don't
have Jessi's interests in mind.

11:48.422 --> 11:51.391
Until we know more, I'm glad
you convinced her to stay away.

11:51.425 --> 11:54.690
Except I did it by telling her
she's going to meet Sarah.

11:54.728 --> 11:56.855
But Sarah said she'd contact you.

11:56.897 --> 12:00.663
So if I can't find her soon,
I've only made the situation worse.

12:03.971 --> 12:06.235
- Where are we going?
- I'll tell you in the car.

12:06.273 --> 12:08.833
- Kyle, you can't leave.
- Why? What's wrong?

12:08.876 --> 12:10.605
I need 2,000 bucks by yesterday.

12:10.644 --> 12:12.771
- I'm going to prom.
- You're not old enough.

12:12.813 --> 12:16.681
I'm also not rich enough. And
your brain power equals my cash flow.

12:16.717 --> 12:18.947
I'd like to help,
but I really need to go.

12:18.986 --> 12:20.078
To get Sarah?

12:22.489 --> 12:26.391
- I'm planning on it.
- Let me come with you.

12:26.427 --> 12:29.589
I think it'd be better for you guys
to meet here for the first time.

12:29.629 --> 12:30.960
But I'm her daughter.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.195
And she's been in hiding for 20 years.

12:37.236 --> 12:41.297
It might be best for the two of you
to meet someplace quiet, safe.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.638
<i>- It's contest time.
- This is it.</i>

12:43.676 --> 12:46.611
<i>If you're the 82nd caller,
you win a $50 gift certificate</i>

12:46.646 --> 12:49.479
<i>to Harville's Caramels,
Seattle's finest candy store.</i>

12:49.515 --> 12:51.779
What does that have to do
with paying for prom?

12:51.818 --> 12:56.050
I win and I sell it. It's a start.

12:56.089 --> 12:59.081
OK, 82nd caller.

13:00.860 --> 13:03.488
Wait. Now!

13:04.764 --> 13:06.789
<i>Lucky 82,
you're on the air.</i>

13:06.833 --> 13:09.233
<i>- Hello? I won?
- That's right.</i>

13:09.268 --> 13:11.292
<i>- Now hang on the line...
- I won!</i>

13:12.304 --> 13:14.295
You're not going anywhere.

13:17.008 --> 13:18.270
Let's go.

13:18.310 --> 13:20.938
I think the problem with my lyrics
is your music.

13:20.979 --> 13:22.310
Come again.

13:22.347 --> 13:25.339
It's showy, yet dull
and emotionally barren.

13:25.383 --> 13:28.750
- So it's the melody's fault?
- A little constructive criticism.

13:28.787 --> 13:31.950
That from someone who thinks
b-flat means to fully recline.

13:31.990 --> 13:35.517
Funny, considering your big talent
is mixing other people's songs.

13:37.562 --> 13:40.497
Sorry. What, did you need me
to write you a pithy comeback?

13:40.532 --> 13:44.332
You know what? All you do is cut
down everything and everyone around you.

13:44.369 --> 13:46.462
You tell yourself you're edgy.

13:46.505 --> 13:49.531
You don't realize everyone
knows you're jealous, because

13:49.574 --> 13:52.600
they've found something meaningful
and you haven't.

13:54.945 --> 13:57.436
Looks like you could use
a pithy comeback now, too.

13:57.481 --> 14:00.644
- How about, "I quit"?
- My thought exactly.

14:00.684 --> 14:02.914
You can find yourself another DJ.

14:11.061 --> 14:15.054
- No one inside remembers her.
- I told you it was a long shot.

14:15.099 --> 14:18.068
No one saw her drive away,
so we can't even track her car.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.872
<i>- You ever play driver/rider?
- What's that?</i>

14:24.909 --> 14:28.367
I played it when I was a kid.
You match the drivers with their rides.

14:31.916 --> 14:36.250
Late 30s, lives off her tips, but still
finds enough dough for highlights.

14:36.953 --> 14:39.217
15-year-old beater with expired plates.

14:44.694 --> 14:46.321
I was really good at it.

14:47.297 --> 14:49.595
If I can describe every car
in the lot last night

14:49.632 --> 14:52.100
and the people in the diner,
can you match them up?

14:52.135 --> 14:56.094
- I can if you can.
- That's something I'm really good at.

15:12.589 --> 15:16.719
<i>Besides the waitress's car,
there's a sports car, a blue minivan,</i>

15:16.759 --> 15:21.957
<i>a rusty pickup, an old motorcycle,
and two sedans;</i>

15:21.997 --> 15:25.228
<i>A blue four-door with a rental sticker,
the other dark gray.</i>

15:25.267 --> 15:27.827
<i>Who's inside the diner?</i>

15:30.439 --> 15:32.805
You haven't told him
about us meeting.

15:32.841 --> 15:36.436
Adam knows about the messages,
but I never mentioned them to Jessi.

15:36.478 --> 15:37.706
Good.

15:37.746 --> 15:39.873
<i>A man, mid 30s, in a nice suit.</i>

15:39.915 --> 15:42.543
<i>He's with a girl, early 20s,
in a tight red shirt.</i>

15:42.584 --> 15:45.951
<i>An affair.
She's the sports car, he's the minivan.</i>

15:45.988 --> 15:48.582
- Minivan?
- It's his turn to carpool the kids.

15:50.225 --> 15:53.194
<i>Man, mid 20s, flannel shirt
talking to the waitress.</i>

15:53.228 --> 15:55.219
<i>He's the pickup truck.</i>

15:55.264 --> 15:58.495
<i>The cook with the tattoo
on his hand must be the motorcycle.</i>

15:58.533 --> 16:01.468
<i>Getting the hang of it.</i>

16:01.503 --> 16:04.130
<i>Which leaves an older man;
heavy, tired.</i>

16:04.171 --> 16:09.666
- He's driving the rental.
- Sarah's driving the gray sedan.

16:09.710 --> 16:11.769
OK, how did you do that?

16:11.812 --> 16:16.181
I calculated the speed of the telephone
lines, the radio station switcher,

16:16.217 --> 16:19.277
and physiological requirements
to dial a multidigit number.

16:24.091 --> 16:27.549
We're going to win every prize
on every radio station in Seattle,

16:27.595 --> 16:31.656
then sell the booty online for half off.
I'll be swimming in green by dinnertime.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.634
You are up for this, aren't you?

16:34.669 --> 16:38.036
I mean, I could cut you in
for, say, 10 percent?

16:38.072 --> 16:41.508
- I'm waiting anyway.
- Don't you need money for prom?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.567
No one would want to take me.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.374
But I don't care
because I'm meeting my mother.

16:46.413 --> 16:50.008
That's really great. I'm happy for you.
So, five percent it is.

16:53.086 --> 16:56.613
"You know you want to:
vote Hilary for Prom Queen?"

16:56.656 --> 17:00.490
Are you trying to get elected Prom Queen
or invade a small country?

17:00.527 --> 17:03.018
I am like the Einstein
of social networking.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.226
And I'm choosing to use my powers
for good instead of evil.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.926
"Good" meaning your coronation?

17:07.968 --> 17:11.494
Trick to getting votes is research
and making sure everyone gets laid.

17:11.538 --> 17:13.529
Well, except you of course.

17:15.875 --> 17:19.538
So, what's up with Declan?
How's he faring?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.740
Look at you, curious kitty.

17:21.781 --> 17:24.545
I'm asking for
demonstration purposes only.

17:24.584 --> 17:28.644
There's no confirmed kill as of late,

17:28.687 --> 17:32.783
but four sharks are circling.
Two are cheerleaders.

17:32.825 --> 17:34.952
No surprise.

17:34.994 --> 17:38.430
Of course, it could be time
for the resurrection of Leclan.

17:38.464 --> 17:39.988
I'm so not going there.

17:40.032 --> 17:43.229
But relationships like yours
bring order to the universe.

17:43.268 --> 17:47.932
Nothing says copacetic like reuniting
Beachwood's very own Brangelina.

17:47.973 --> 17:51.704
Whoever invented proms
should be forced to plan one.

17:51.744 --> 17:54.235
Great, I'm stuck
with Gloom and Gloomier.

17:54.279 --> 17:56.713
Unless people brown-bag it,
prom's ruined.

17:56.749 --> 17:58.376
What happened with the food?

17:58.417 --> 18:00.715
Caterer got shut down
by the Health Department

18:00.753 --> 18:02.277
and I can't get our deposit.

18:03.756 --> 18:07.214
This might not be
such a good time to tell you this.

18:07.259 --> 18:11.354
- Tell me what?
- We don't have a DJ, either.

18:25.543 --> 18:28.706
- How'd you find me?
- Traffic cameras.

18:28.746 --> 18:30.145
Traffic cameras.

18:30.181 --> 18:34.743
I reviewed the Seattle traffic database,
starting with the three near the diner,

18:34.786 --> 18:38.722
then sequentially accessed
137 more to lead me here.

18:38.756 --> 18:40.951
I just wanted to tell you
that Jessi's OK.

18:40.992 --> 18:42.892
Understand what Taylor's been doing?

18:42.927 --> 18:45.725
I don't think she'll believe
until she hears it from you.

18:46.898 --> 18:50.732
- That won't be possible.
- She really wants to meet you, Sarah.

18:50.768 --> 18:52.360
Did you tell her?

18:53.937 --> 18:56.701
- Why'd you do that?
- I didn't know what else to do.

18:56.740 --> 18:58.173
I couldn't get her to listen.

18:58.208 --> 19:01.803
But now you've
made things complicated.

19:01.845 --> 19:04.814
Jessi was so excited to find out
her mother is really alive.

19:04.848 --> 19:06.713
I'm not her mother.

19:13.723 --> 19:17.955
I can't be a mother to her. To anyone.

19:17.994 --> 19:22.090
Please don't slip away again.
You can't just disappear.

19:22.132 --> 19:26.193
I'm glad Jessi's safe.
That's all I wanted.

19:26.236 --> 19:29.262
I don't believe that.
You didn't have to come back here.

19:29.306 --> 19:31.706
Nobody had to know that you were alive.

19:31.741 --> 19:33.902
But Jessi touched
something inside of you.

19:35.811 --> 19:38.109
You left Jessi the record of that song.

19:38.147 --> 19:42.083
You didn't have to do that.
You could have left it for me.

19:42.118 --> 19:44.143
But I think you wanted Jessi to feel

19:44.186 --> 19:48.520
that somehow you were around
looking out for her.

19:48.557 --> 19:51.720
All she wants is to know you.

19:53.262 --> 19:56.754
And I think you're lucky to have
this opportunity to know her.

20:00.469 --> 20:02.369
OK.

20:03.606 --> 20:05.130
I'll come.

20:06.942 --> 20:10.173
- This afternoon.
- Wait, my address.

20:10.212 --> 20:13.704
- I know where you live.
- Right.

20:14.750 --> 20:18.913
Tell Jessi
I'm looking forward to meeting her.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.782
I will.

20:37.839 --> 20:42.902
- What did she say?
- She's looking forward to meeting you.

20:42.944 --> 20:45.276
- When is she coming?
- This afternoon.

20:48.149 --> 20:50.743
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

20:51.953 --> 20:55.912
OK. Enough of that.
I need you. We're on a roll.

20:57.525 --> 20:58.719
What's going on?

20:58.760 --> 21:02.695
Thanks to Jessi,
we're gonna prom it in style, bro.

21:07.301 --> 21:09.565
If it's food we need,
then it's food we get.

21:09.603 --> 21:12.766
- French would be my choice.
- Just remember, we can't afford...

21:12.806 --> 21:16.970
Then French it is!
The Gourmet Club will be psyched!

21:17.010 --> 21:18.568
Is everything all right?

21:18.612 --> 21:20.910
She's trying to save us
from starving at prom.

21:20.948 --> 21:24.941
A little setback with the caterer. And
then there's the issue with the music.

21:24.985 --> 21:27.317
Prom sucks.

21:28.522 --> 21:31.923
What's wrong with Lori?

21:31.959 --> 21:34.427
You cannot give me an opening like that.

21:34.461 --> 21:38.591
- What's Josh doing?
- Raising money.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.031
In Spanish?

21:40.067 --> 21:43.093
Apparently we're double dating
to the prom with him and Andy.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.627
Actually, I'm taking Josh,
you're taking Andy.

21:46.672 --> 21:51.268
- But I want to go with you.
- You still are. It's a technicality.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.438
A "date switch." It's the only way
underclassmen can go to prom.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.811
We're going together.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.784
It's just I have officially asked Josh
and you've officially invited Andy.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.014
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask you if it was OK.

22:02.054 --> 22:06.252
It is OK. It's more than OK.
Thank you for thinking of it.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.954
Josh needed my help,
I asked myself, what would you do?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.471
Yeah!

22:31.216 --> 22:34.310
- What?
- Why do you hate prom?

22:34.352 --> 22:37.515
Jessi, I'm so not in the mood.

22:39.624 --> 22:43.060
- She comes in anyway.
- You're sad.

22:43.094 --> 22:46.655
No, I'm frustrated and annoyed.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.331
OK, maybe a little sad.

22:51.636 --> 22:52.660
Why?

22:53.938 --> 22:55.496
I just don't understand.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.737
I mean, prom's supposed to be
this great milestone, right?

22:58.777 --> 23:04.716
The whole thing has just left me feeling
sort of lost and empty.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.483
That's how I feel most of the time.

23:14.892 --> 23:17.486
I just wanted prom
to mean something.

23:18.996 --> 23:23.057
Wasn't it about celebrating the times
you've had with your friends?

23:23.100 --> 23:26.501
- I guess.
- You have lots of friends.

23:26.537 --> 23:30.098
But it shouldn't just be this night
where we all play dress-up

23:30.140 --> 23:32.700
and nobody looks
like themselves anyway.

23:32.743 --> 23:36.179
- You should be who you are.
- And who are you?

23:38.949 --> 23:41.577
The eternal question.

23:41.618 --> 23:44.746
Honestly? No clue.

23:53.429 --> 23:56.262
She even looks like me, you know?

23:56.299 --> 23:59.132
Like the way Adam looks like Kyle?

24:03.106 --> 24:05.233
You must be happy to meet her.

24:06.442 --> 24:08.307
I want to remember every second.

24:09.579 --> 24:12.070
That's what you do
when you don't have a past.

24:13.149 --> 24:15.583
You live in the moment.

24:22.225 --> 24:26.594
The big difference is
Sarah didn't have long hair.

24:29.599 --> 24:31.829
If you want, I could change that.

24:50.719 --> 24:53.916
- I had no idea you spoke French.
- I speak French food.

24:53.955 --> 24:57.413
So, we just need to give Chef Jacques
a check for $5,000 by tomorrow and,

24:57.459 --> 24:59.825
<i>voilá, we're in
for the gastronomical treat.</i>

24:59.861 --> 25:02.125
But I told you
we don't have any money left.

25:02.164 --> 25:05.622
You're just going to have to fix that,
aren't you?

25:11.973 --> 25:13.565
How are you doing?

25:15.076 --> 25:18.772
- It's hard to just wait.
- You've done all you can do.

25:20.414 --> 25:21.540
Maybe.

25:21.582 --> 25:25.848
I just hope Sarah wants to meet Jessi
half as much as Jessi wants to meet her.

25:26.787 --> 25:28.015
What do you mean?

25:28.055 --> 25:30.990
Sarah's pretended to be dead
all these years.

25:31.025 --> 25:34.188
She cut herself off
from everyone she knew.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.958
Doesn't sound like someone eager
to make a connection.

25:36.997 --> 25:41.593
- You think she may not come?
- I hope that's not the case, but...

25:41.635 --> 25:45.332
I'm more worried that if she does come,
it won't be enough.

25:49.910 --> 25:53.744
The last time I did this I was with
Declan and we were both wasted.

25:54.882 --> 25:58.545
- Do you need a drink first?
- No! Trust me, better sober.

26:03.590 --> 26:06.024
I have been angry with you for so long.

26:09.929 --> 26:11.760
I don't want to be anymore.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.265
I'm glad.

26:17.403 --> 26:19.496
Me, too.

26:25.678 --> 26:28.272
You sure about this?

26:28.314 --> 26:30.782
Jessi, once we do this
there's no turning back.

26:30.817 --> 26:32.341
I know.

26:45.364 --> 26:47.525
You're either lost or waiting for Kyle.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.124
A little bit of both.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.658
Is Kyle on board with the date swap?

26:54.039 --> 26:56.530
He'd love to help you go,
except there won't be one.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.271
Do you know how hard
I've worked for that night?

26:59.311 --> 27:01.802
How many donuts I sold
to raise money for balloons?

27:01.847 --> 27:04.315
Should have kept them
so we'd have something to eat

27:04.349 --> 27:06.146
now the caterer's taken our money.

27:06.184 --> 27:10.621
OK. One, I think you've had
way too much caffeine.

27:10.656 --> 27:14.717
And two, are you telling me
there are problems with the prom?

27:14.760 --> 27:17.388
Yes. And yes.

27:19.932 --> 27:21.832
No, don't even think it.

27:23.068 --> 27:25.434
- Are you all right?
- No.

27:25.470 --> 27:29.337
I just had the most terrible thought
flash in my brain: "What would Kyle do?"

27:30.374 --> 27:34.140
- I think that's going around.
- How much do you need?

27:35.913 --> 27:38.973
- You don't want to know.
- I hate Kyle.

27:42.653 --> 27:45.486
You take cash?

27:45.523 --> 27:47.047
I'll get it!

27:53.230 --> 27:55.027
I thought you'd be here.

27:56.534 --> 27:59.367
- What did you do to your hair?
- I cut it.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.565
- Let's go.
- No.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.539
- You know what today is.
- I'm not going.

28:08.578 --> 28:10.910
- That's not really your decision.
- Yes, it is.

28:10.947 --> 28:13.711
- You can't force her to go anywhere.
- I have every right.

28:13.750 --> 28:14.978
I'm aware of your rights,

28:15.018 --> 28:17.680
but I'll do what's necessary
to make sure Jessi's safe.

28:17.721 --> 28:21.213
I wonder what your licensing board
would say about that.

28:21.257 --> 28:24.055
Let them say what they want.
You're not taking her.

28:24.094 --> 28:26.255
What happens when they ask questions?

28:26.296 --> 28:28.856
- About Kyle?
- I'll answer them.

28:31.935 --> 28:35.371
I can't believe this.
You know how important this is.

28:35.405 --> 28:38.636
They think that I was wrong
to even create you.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.472
We have to prove that I was right.

28:40.510 --> 28:44.810
I don't care what Latnok thinks.
I don't have to win them back.

28:44.848 --> 28:50.343
I've done everything for our dream.
But they turned their backs on me.

28:50.387 --> 28:53.355
And now you? You owe me.

28:53.389 --> 28:57.257
I owe you? Is that the price
of being your daughter?

28:57.292 --> 28:59.852
You're damn right it is!
I gave you life!

28:59.895 --> 29:03.831
- And they saved it. So get out.
- You heard her.

29:10.506 --> 29:12.474
You'll regret this.

29:13.542 --> 29:14.975
I'm all you've got.

29:35.430 --> 29:36.920
Thank you.

29:39.467 --> 29:40.957
Are you OK?

29:42.670 --> 29:44.467
I will be.

29:45.173 --> 29:46.834
My mother is coming.

29:52.447 --> 29:54.813
Someone needed money.
I didn't want to,

29:54.849 --> 29:57.409
I did, which made me feel better,
but I'm broke...

29:57.452 --> 30:02.355
- Exactly how much money is left?
- I can spring for the prom tickets,

30:02.390 --> 30:06.952
a sky-blue rayon suit
and a scoop of ice cream.

30:10.431 --> 30:12.296
Two scoops?

30:12.333 --> 30:15.063
- God, you're such a moron.
- I am?

30:15.103 --> 30:17.400
I wanted to go.
It should be my treat.

30:17.437 --> 30:20.531
- I just assumed that...
- That it was this whole archaic thing

30:20.574 --> 30:23.304
where you save your lunch money
and mow extra lawns

30:23.343 --> 30:25.743
to take me out
because you think I'm pretty?

30:25.779 --> 30:28.270
Uh-uh. Not having it.
You're the pretty one.

30:28.315 --> 30:32.718
But you wanted a night of cancer-free
fun, and it's my job to pay the way.

30:35.822 --> 30:37.653
Let me explain something to you.

30:38.959 --> 30:42.793
This mouth upchucked
a lot of lunches while in chemo.

30:42.829 --> 30:47.095
And for some stupid reason, you never
stopped wanting to make out with me.

30:48.635 --> 30:50.762
You were generous
with the mouthwash.

30:50.804 --> 30:53.329
- I figured it was cool.
- Would you zip it?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.341
This is, like, a serious moment.

30:58.979 --> 31:02.379
Yes, I'm glad the cancer's gone,

31:02.414 --> 31:06.908
and, yes, I want to party
like a rock star,

31:06.952 --> 31:10.388
but, Josh, you're the reason
I want to celebrate.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.093
You really think I'm pretty?

31:16.028 --> 31:17.290
Ow!

31:17.329 --> 31:19.729
So forget about tossing
the couch for change.

31:19.765 --> 31:21.494
Mama's got you covered.

31:21.534 --> 31:23.866
Exactly how
are you paying for all this?

31:23.903 --> 31:27.339
I recovered from cancer.
My moms will give us money for days.

31:46.624 --> 31:49.821
It's beautiful. Yeah.

31:49.861 --> 31:52.591
- I'm glad you called.
- I'm glad you liked it,

31:52.630 --> 31:55.929
because in order to make those chords
and make that key change

31:55.967 --> 32:00.028
- I had to break two of my fingers.
- I was referring to the lyrics.

32:00.071 --> 32:02.198
I wanted you to know
although I am a cynic,

32:02.240 --> 32:04.333
I'm only a partial cynic.

32:04.375 --> 32:08.106
I timeshare an actual heart
on weekends and major U.S. holidays.

32:08.146 --> 32:13.243
I will be sure to schedule our
future songwriting sessions accordingly.

32:14.319 --> 32:16.685
We're having future sessions?

32:20.091 --> 32:24.754
I guess we should
wrap this one up first.

32:24.795 --> 32:27.593
Um, what prompted you to revisit it?

32:28.599 --> 32:31.864
- You won't believe me if I tell you.
- Try me.

32:33.470 --> 32:35.062
A haircut.

32:37.641 --> 32:38.835
OK.

32:41.645 --> 32:46.105
- We should enter this in the contest.
- I suppose.

32:46.149 --> 32:49.744
Although I'm sure some three-chord
trite piece of crap will win.

32:49.786 --> 32:51.185
You're probably right.

32:56.493 --> 33:00.429
- What's that for?
- You just bought yourself a DJ.

33:01.598 --> 33:05.500
Although I won't attend, on behalf
of Beachwood High, I accept your offer.

33:09.105 --> 33:11.903
I never went
to my high school prom, either.

33:11.941 --> 33:13.909
When you're a 15-year-old senior

33:13.943 --> 33:17.071
with no driver's license,
no one wants to go with you.

33:17.113 --> 33:22.141
But I stayed home, I made fun of it
a bit, and after a while I felt better.

33:23.452 --> 33:25.613
And you regret not going.

33:27.957 --> 33:31.120
I regret that it was just another thing
I never got to do in my life.

33:45.308 --> 33:48.675
Maybe you'd like
to come back in for a while?

33:48.711 --> 33:50.143
No.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.948
She's not coming.

33:54.983 --> 33:58.009
- It's only been...
- 3 hours and 52 minutes.

33:59.421 --> 34:03.187
- Sarah said she'd be here.
- People say a lot of things.

34:03.224 --> 34:06.421
- It doesn't mean they're true.
- Where are you going?

34:08.263 --> 34:11.027
Don't worry,
I'm not going back to Brian.

34:21.342 --> 34:23.504
Uh-oh.

34:23.545 --> 34:25.536
- Am I in trouble?
- Should you be?

34:27.849 --> 34:30.079
I'm so not falling for that one again.

34:33.286 --> 34:37.313
No. There's no reason
I should be in trouble, Dad.

34:37.358 --> 34:39.382
All right, good. Then sit down.

34:44.864 --> 34:47.356
So it looks like Sarah's not coming.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.666
Once Jessi gets back, there's no way
we're sending her to Taylor's.

34:50.704 --> 34:53.764
We've already talked about this,
but it's a family decision.

34:53.806 --> 34:58.005
We want Jessi to stay here until we
can find someplace more permanent.

35:05.152 --> 35:07.882
- I'm OK with it.
- Are you sure?

35:08.055 --> 35:10.489
We want you to be.

35:10.524 --> 35:13.960
Especially you, Lori, given what
happened between you and Jessi.

35:13.994 --> 35:17.121
We don't want you to feel
uncomfortable in any way.

35:19.332 --> 35:23.166
Of course she can stay.
That's what we do, isn't it?

35:25.238 --> 35:28.071
- Sweetie.
- Can I tell Jessi?

35:28.107 --> 35:31.008
- Of course.
- I thought she took off.

35:31.044 --> 35:34.104
She did.
But I think I know where to find her.

35:50.730 --> 35:52.823
How'd you find me?

35:52.865 --> 35:55.095
I've gotten good
at knowing where you'd go.

36:03.508 --> 36:05.203
Did she ever show up?

36:07.979 --> 36:09.003
No.

36:15.420 --> 36:20.551
So my mother lied and my father lied.

36:21.893 --> 36:25.385
- It's true. I'm a mistake.
- Jessi, don't say that.

36:26.832 --> 36:29.494
- You're important.
- No, I never mattered.

36:40.745 --> 36:43.440
You matter to me. And the Tragers.

36:43.614 --> 36:47.106
- We want you to come stay with us.
- No. Don't pity me!

36:47.151 --> 36:49.676
We don't. We care about you.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.245
Jessi, please!
You can be part of our family.

36:52.857 --> 36:57.351
No! That's your family.
It won't ever be mine.

36:57.761 --> 37:00.958
Don't you understand? I'm alone.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.628
Jessi.

37:05.669 --> 37:06.897
You're not alone.

37:10.174 --> 37:13.371
- It's too late.
- It never is.

37:18.482 --> 37:19.972
Jessi!

37:22.119 --> 37:23.710
Her heart has stopped.

37:29.993 --> 37:33.759
<i>Seeing Jessi on the floor,
I knew what I had to do.</i>

37:33.796 --> 37:36.458
<i>I had to save her, to restart her heart.</i>

37:37.534 --> 37:40.662
<i>But was it too late?
Was I strong enough?</i>

37:40.703 --> 37:43.831
<i>And if I failed, would I kill us both?</i>

38:22.945 --> 38:24.742
It's OK now.

38:27.082 --> 38:28.549
I'm here.

38:39.962 --> 38:44.023
When I saw Jessi laying there,
the thought of losing her...

38:46.134 --> 38:48.625
I focused all of my energy
to revive her.

38:48.770 --> 38:50.259
And you did.

38:52.306 --> 38:57.642
- I still feel a little drained.
- But that's not what's worrying you.

39:01.215 --> 39:05.083
In that moment
when I brought Jessi back,

39:05.119 --> 39:09.249
I felt like
there was nothing I couldn't do.

39:11.559 --> 39:13.151
And that scared me.

39:16.063 --> 39:22.093
Kyle, part of growing up is learning
how our actions affect other people,

39:23.738 --> 39:28.539
and how we handle that power. It's
kind of what it's like to be a parent.

39:30.311 --> 39:31.800
Or a friend.

39:34.147 --> 39:38.550
I'm not worried about you.
I think you're going to be just fine.

39:41.988 --> 39:45.617
<i>The road we travel
is unpredictable.</i>

39:45.659 --> 39:51.063
<i>Sometimes it's smooth,
and sometimes it's filled with bumps.</i>

39:55.335 --> 40:00.102
<i>But if we're lucky,
we find people to travel with us.</i>

40:09.549 --> 40:11.813
I know this is gonna sound weird,

40:11.851 --> 40:14.944
but remember that deal
we made about prom night?

40:15.721 --> 40:18.656
- Regrettably, yes.
- Regrettably?

40:18.691 --> 40:20.886
It was a silly thing
to promise one another,

40:20.926 --> 40:24.362
since two cheerleaders are
getting your magic and romance package.

40:24.396 --> 40:27.490
- Where'd you hear that?
- I have my sources.

40:27.533 --> 40:30.001
I have a source too,
that says you're not going.

40:30.035 --> 40:33.402
Then your source is wrong.
I'm going stag.

40:34.540 --> 40:38.408
What, and miss the chance
to mock the madness firsthand?

40:38.444 --> 40:41.436
Good. So you
don't have a date yet, either.

40:43.549 --> 40:45.414
Guess your source is wrong, too.

40:48.053 --> 40:51.716
Oh, my God.
You planned this all along.

40:52.558 --> 40:55.356
You turned down girls
so I would stick to the deal

40:55.394 --> 40:57.861
and hook up with you on prom night?

40:59.163 --> 41:03.463
I know we said we'd go with one another
if we didn't have dates,

41:03.501 --> 41:05.526
but I didn't rig anything.

41:06.604 --> 41:10.404
I'm not asking you to go to prom
because there's no one else.

41:11.709 --> 41:15.839
I'm asking because you are the only one
I want to go with.

41:20.184 --> 41:22.152
So, then, we should go.

41:43.907 --> 41:48.469
<i>Our journey is really a search,
a yearning for love and connection.</i>

41:48.512 --> 41:51.913
<i>And sometimes it leads us back home.</i>

41:52.716 --> 41:57.119
- Why didn't you come to the house?
- I was scared.

41:58.355 --> 41:59.879
Of me?

42:01.057 --> 42:03.491
Of not being everything
you want me to be.

42:05.195 --> 42:10.155
- I just want to know you.
- I want to know you, too.

42:13.503 --> 42:18.406
- What about Brian?
- Kyle said he's taking care of it.

42:42.631 --> 42:45.862
- A one-way ticket?
- Trust me.

42:47.269 --> 42:49.328
You don't want to come back.

43:02.451 --> 43:04.282
<i>Her heart has stopped!</i>

43:20.301 --> 43:21.632
He's incredible.

43:22.303 --> 43:24.863
More than we dreamed
we'd ever see in our lifetimes.

43:26.608 --> 43:29.168
I think it's time
we introduce ourselves.
