WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.595
Ugh. All Janet voids are nothing,

00:12.679 --> 00:16.975
but Neutral Janet voids
are, like, the most nothing.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.352
Judge, please, please don't cancel Earth.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.063
Why not? The system's broken.
You guys proved it.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.858
I just wanna reboot the whole thing
and go back to my chambers.

00:24.941 --> 00:30.029
I am on Season Three of <i>Justified,</i>
and can I just tell you, it is so good!

00:30.113 --> 00:32.657
I, like, binged
all of Season Two in a day.

00:33.241 --> 00:36.077
Think of all the amazing human achievement
you'd be eliminating.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.872
The works of William Shakespeare,
the pyramids,

00:38.955 --> 00:40.373
-Timothy Olyphant...

00:40.457 --> 00:41.458
Oh, that one stings.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.003
There's like 50 gallons of man
in a ten-gallon hat.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.172
I'm like "Ooh"!

00:47.255 --> 00:50.884
Look, I'm the frickin' Judge,
and I made a frickin' ruling,

00:50.967 --> 00:56.514
and it's gonna frickin' happen, as soon as
I find the frickin' clicker thing!

00:56.598 --> 00:57.807
All right, what do I search for?

00:57.891 --> 01:02.145
"Humanity eraser button
garage door opener thingy Judge."

01:02.812 --> 01:03.855
Ugh!

01:06.107 --> 01:08.693
Well, it wasn't in you. Any last words?

01:08.777 --> 01:11.279
These are my last words. End of words.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.114
Yes. Really boring.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.449
Bye!

01:15.658 --> 01:17.744
All right, who's next?

01:17.827 --> 01:20.246
Your dad's pimply butt, you fat dink.

01:20.330 --> 01:26.211
That is so interesting, because
last time I checked, I didn't have a dad.

01:26.294 --> 01:31.382
That's why I'm attracted to all the
father figures on the TV shows I watch.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.300
M'kay?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.928
We can't play keep-away forever.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.763
Keep trying. Get her to see the light.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.265
I already showed her the light.
She wasn't impressed.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.226
To be fair, she was there
when it was invented.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.769
-Hey, bud.
-Hi!

01:42.852 --> 01:45.522
I know you're trying to think
of ways to save every soul

01:45.605 --> 01:46.898
who's ever lived and whatnot, but...

01:47.565 --> 01:49.484
we may only have
a half hour left to exist,

01:49.567 --> 01:54.864
so I just wanted to check in with you,
vis-à-vis... us.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.908
Oh! Okay, yeah, cool.

01:56.991 --> 01:57.826
I love you.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.328
-Whoa! Really?
-Yeah.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.289
I love you. So, do you love me?

02:03.373 --> 02:04.332
Yeah, I do.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.167
Well, then, cool!

02:06.251 --> 02:08.670
-You and I are on our way to Coolsville.

02:08.753 --> 02:14.134
You seem oddly sure, which is unlike you,
but it's kind of doing it for me.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.468
Should we get out of here?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.971
No, but I like the confidence.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.181
When you have 1,000
different versions of yourself

02:20.265 --> 02:21.432
over multiple timelines

02:21.516 --> 02:23.852
fused and instantly placed
into your consciousness,

02:23.935 --> 02:25.603
it gives you a real sense of clarity.

02:25.687 --> 02:29.274
-You saw the Time Knife, huh?
-Yep, saw the Time Knife.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.025
-It was neat.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.320
Okay! Let's save humanity, shall we?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.615
Can one of you Janets get me a chalkboard

02:37.699 --> 02:40.952
and a copy of Judith Shklar's
<i>Ordinary Vices? </i>Oh!

02:41.035 --> 02:42.495
And maybe some warm pretzels?

02:42.579 --> 02:45.582
If we goin' out, I'm goin' out
with a belly full of warm pretzels.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.541
Yummy, yum-yum.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.168
Yummy!

02:54.841 --> 02:58.553
Okay, before we try to completely redesign
the entire afterlife,

02:58.636 --> 03:02.599
has anyone just thought of a good reason
the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.225
Because it would be a bummer.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.810
Yeah. We might need more than that.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.562
Are you at least gonna write it down?

03:08.563 --> 03:09.564
Yeah, all right.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.360
Did you actually write it down
or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?

03:14.444 --> 03:15.945
Okay. We need to think bigger.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.615
We need to come up with
an entirely new afterlife system

03:18.698 --> 03:23.286
that both the Good and Bad Places
agree on, which... seems impossible.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.289
Nonsense. Compromise is always possible.

03:26.372 --> 03:30.335
I was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars,
LeBron James and Dr. Ruth Westheimer--

03:30.418 --> 03:31.794
We don't have time for this, babe.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.131
Fine. Long story short,
LeBron performed a successful tracheotomy,

03:35.214 --> 03:38.384
the song won multiple Grammys
and everyone was really happy.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.886
Well, now I wanna hear the story.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.763
No, you're right. Let's focus.

03:41.846 --> 03:45.099
So, in this essay,
"Putting Cruelty First,"

03:45.183 --> 03:48.978
Judith Shklar contends
that we should consider cruelty

03:49.062 --> 03:50.813
as society's primary flaw.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.857
I'm sorry, are you wearing roller skates?

03:53.441 --> 03:54.275
Yeah!

03:54.359 --> 03:55.568
I got 'em from Disco Janet.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.486
Thanks, Disco Janet!

03:56.569 --> 03:57.403
Solid!

03:57.987 --> 03:58.905
Anyway, here's her point.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.782
Imagine someone sells a joint

04:00.865 --> 04:03.785
and then gets locked away
in a dangerous prison for years.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.913
The crime isn't cruel,
but the punishment is.

04:06.996 --> 04:07.872
That's a problem.

04:07.956 --> 04:08.790
Tell me about it.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.709
I once went to jail for a week
just because I stole a hot dog.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.087
Well, a hot dog-shaped car.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.588
I stole the Wienermobile.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.590
This is the problem
with the current system.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.467
Live anything less than
the most exemplary life,

04:19.550 --> 04:22.136
and you are brutally tortured forever,
with no recourse.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.763
The cruelty of the punishment

04:23.846 --> 04:26.933
does not match the cruelty
of the life that one has lived.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.851
Now, watch this spin.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.563
So, we need to come up with a system

04:32.647 --> 04:35.441
that will result in the least amount
of cruelty and suffering

04:35.525 --> 04:36.401
to those who don't deserve it.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.194
This is a problem of justice.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.829
Hearing you talk about
philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.330
-You wanna get out of here?
-Yes.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.790
No, keep going.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.709
-Ugh!

04:52.792 --> 04:54.627
Bad Janet voids are the worst.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.171
-Music off.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.381
Oh, right. I forgot.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.425
-Make it louder.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.677
What if you start humanity over
from scratch

05:02.760 --> 05:06.139
and humans evolve over millions of years
and they end up worse?

05:06.222 --> 05:09.934
What if they invent rap rock sooner
and it becomes the only kind of music?

05:10.018 --> 05:12.687
Do you really want to oversee
an entire world of Limp Bizkits,

05:12.770 --> 05:14.564
run by Emperor Kid Rock?

05:14.647 --> 05:15.648
Not my problem.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.900
All right, here we go.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.360
"Software update"?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.903
No. Cancel.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.988
Why is it doing it now?

05:22.572 --> 05:25.366
-Argh, this computer sucks.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.332
Okay, mama. See you in the next life.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.499
Before you marbleize me,

05:33.583 --> 05:36.711
can I just make one final statement
to summarize how I really feel?

05:36.794 --> 05:38.087
I think I know where this is going.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.893
Okay, Disco Janet. You're up.

05:51.976 --> 05:52.935
Outta sight.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.312
What are you guys
still doing here?

05:54.395 --> 05:56.856
Just go back to Mindy's
and have a lukewarm beer,

05:56.939 --> 05:58.149
and wait for me to end you there.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.650
Except for you, cookie-puss.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.236
I'll always make room for you.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.240
Wait a second... that's it.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.158
I agree.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.535
Chidi should hook up with the Judge
to get us out of trouble.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.578
I've done that a bunch of times.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.829
It's called a Jacksonville Plea Bargain.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.915
No. Mindy's house.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.793
Eleanor always thought
there should be a Medium Place,

06:16.876 --> 06:19.962
for people who led medium lives.
That's the answer.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.131
We make the Medium Place a third option.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.216
Of course!

06:23.299 --> 06:26.385
Maybe if you score
negative points on Earth, um...

06:26.469 --> 06:29.097
"Sorry, ya blew it.
Enjoy having your penis flattened."

06:29.180 --> 06:32.141
Over a million or whatever... party time!

06:32.225 --> 06:36.229
And everyone else in between
gets their own, personal Cincinnati.

06:36.312 --> 06:39.690
It's definitely less cruel than
the current system, but it's not great.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.610
It might be the best we can do,
given the circumstances.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.195
Let's try to sell it to the brass.

06:46.114 --> 06:46.948
Hello, all.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.076
Thought since the universe is ending,
you'd be less... cheery.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.788
Hard not to be cheery when you're eating
this delicious frozen yogurt.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.623
I got a small amount of each flavor.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.708
It's the only way to ensure
a mouthful of compromise.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.418
-You are so right.
-Well said!

06:59.502 --> 07:01.546
Shut up. Shut up.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.713
Hi.

07:02.797 --> 07:03.673
Shut up.

07:03.756 --> 07:04.924
I'm confident now.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.801
Sorry. We're just short on time.

07:06.884 --> 07:11.597
Look, we have a new idea about how humans
could be placed in the afterlife--

07:11.681 --> 07:13.141
We love it. We're in.

07:13.724 --> 07:14.767
You don't even want to hear it?

07:14.851 --> 07:16.769
Nope. If you guys came up with it,
it must be good.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.730
-Oh, yeah.
-Guys, they said yes. Let's take the win.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.482
Now, all we have to do is convince Shawn.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.567
I'll take the lead.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.027
If I can convince Dr. Ruth
not to sue Bruno Mars

07:25.111 --> 07:27.530
over songwriting credit on "Uptown Funk,"
I can handle this.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.158
Okay, you gotta tell me
that story on the way.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.745
So, anyone who doesn't meet the threshold
for the new Medium Place neighborhood

07:34.829 --> 07:35.872
is yours for the taking.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.416
The Bad Place still has
plenty of people to torture.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.544
I have to admit, this does make sense,

07:41.627 --> 07:43.921
and I like that your side
is settling for a crappy deal,

07:44.005 --> 07:45.882
while my side stays mostly the same.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.218
What the hell? I'm in.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.638
-Really?
-No!

07:52.722 --> 07:54.265
You actually believed me?

07:54.348 --> 07:58.603
Dude, in 20 minutes, all of humanity
is going to be erased forever.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.647
-And?
-The Bad Place will get emptied out, too.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.860
You will have no one to torture
for billions of years. Everyone loses.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.863
Oh, I know, but here's the thing.

08:09.614 --> 08:14.202
I don't care if everyone loses,
as long as you lose.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.287
Shawn, listen to reason.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.205
Why should I?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.248
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't mucked around

08:19.332 --> 08:22.585
with your neighborhood and your new ideas.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.087
New ideas are gross. They sicken me.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.717
Shawn, you used to be cool,
but you've changed, man.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.428
I'm gonna go write an evil speech
for when this is all over.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.515
It is gonna be so... long.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.979
<i> ♪ You can ring my bell ♪</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:43.356
Whoo!

08:49.862 --> 08:51.572
-Wait a second.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.657
What was I doing?

08:52.740 --> 08:55.451
I'll tell ya what you were doing.
You were tearin' up the dance floor.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.120
No. I was looking for
the stupid clicker thingy.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.540
Gah! Those infectious disco grooves!

09:01.499 --> 09:02.833
So, wait, wait, wait.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.961
We have this amazing new idea
and Shawn is almost on board.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.672
Maybe if you talked to him,
you could nudge him towards an agreement.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.798
I don't take sides.

09:08.881 --> 09:13.010
I am the Judge. My only concerns
are fairness and impartiality.

09:14.554 --> 09:19.433
<i>♪ Gonna erase the Earth</i>
<i>Erase the Earth ♪</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:21.936
That song is really my jam.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.356
-Humanity eraser thingy.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.445
Well, later, skater.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.905
Keep on truckin'.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.032
Next!

09:35.116 --> 09:38.578
Even for a demon,
Shawn is being a real knob.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.455
Guys, I know what we have to offer him
to get him to change his mind.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.456
What?

09:42.540 --> 09:46.794
Something he wants.
Once we figure that out, we're golden.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.504
It's pointless.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.258
He's so focused on beating us
that he's willing to burn everything down.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.010
There's nothing we can offer him.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.095
Actually, there is something he wants.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.598
Cruelty.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.683
So, let's give it to him.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.900
Hey, guys. Just smashing some stuff.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.945
-What's up?
-Listen, demon.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.447
We know how much you want us to lose.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.699
So, we volunteer to lose, permanently.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.494
If you agree to let the Judge establish
a real Medium Place...

10:21.120 --> 10:24.123
you can torture the four of us forever.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.875
-Really?
- Yeah.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.252
This is a classic trolley problem.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.380
One of your boys sets off a stink-bomb
on the trolley, causing a commotion,

10:31.464 --> 10:34.467
so the rest of the crew can pickpocket
people as they run off the train.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.428
That's very wrong,
but in a roundabout way,

10:37.511 --> 10:39.680
you kinda got where you needed to be.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.682
I'll even give you a head start
on my torture.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.434
I cannot pull off the mod look.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.685
You can take me, too.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.689
I couldn't live with myself knowing
you four were down there without me.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.568
Wow! This is a toughie.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.988
On one hand, I would love to get
some spiders in those buttholes.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.492
On the other, there'd be billions
of buttholes going completely un-spidered.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.537
How about this: everyone who dies
goes to the Bad Place

11:04.038 --> 11:05.956
and I get to torture all of you?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.208
Sounds good to us.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.793
No, dummies.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.004
That's already how it works,
except we're also tortured.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.923
Look, I put forward a proposal.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.800
Are you not even going to negotiate?

11:15.883 --> 11:18.135
He's got a point.
The fair thing for us to do is

11:18.219 --> 11:21.055
just keep on giving up
more and more stuff we want, unilaterally,

11:21.138 --> 11:22.598
until this demon is finally happy.

11:22.681 --> 11:23.933
Fork this!

11:24.016 --> 11:26.727
If we're gonna lose,
let's lose on our own terms.

11:26.811 --> 11:31.399
Let's come up with a completely new idea
that actually makes the universe better.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.068
Amen. At least then
we can hold our heads high.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.153
Okay, we need to come up with

11:36.237 --> 11:38.739
-our ideal plan in about ten minutes.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.242
Guys, it's all come to this.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.994
Everything we've been through,

11:44.912 --> 11:48.958
the multiple lives you led on Earth,
all the lives you led here,

11:49.041 --> 11:51.627
all the ethics training and lessons,

11:51.710 --> 11:55.589
and journeys to the farthest corners
of the afterlife,

11:55.673 --> 11:59.552
all happened so that
we could be here, together,

11:59.635 --> 12:02.805
as the very best versions of ourselves,

12:02.888 --> 12:07.351
to solve the ultimate problem
in the nick of time.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.437
Cool speech. Now, it's nine minutes.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.274
Chidi, can you do this?

12:13.357 --> 12:16.277
Actually, what you just said,
"the very best versions of ourselves,"

12:16.360 --> 12:17.403
gave me an idea.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.156
Ha! Turns out it was a cool speech.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.035
Not in you, either.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.204
-I just have one thing left to say.
-Beh-beh-beh.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.790
-No--
-Not falling for that again.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.668
Man. She is committed.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.045
That just leaves you.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.423
Your Honor, we have an idea
we'd like to present.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.049
Not interested, stretch.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.595
How can we convince her of our plan
if she won't even listen?

12:42.678 --> 12:45.681
Well, if she's not gonna stay out here,
you gotta go in there.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.267
But that didn't really work great
last time.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.268
Yeah, it wasn't amazing,

12:49.351 --> 12:52.438
but she's gonna marbleize me in
two minutes, so we might as well try.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.481
Are we all gonna be...

12:54.315 --> 12:55.691
-you, again?
- I don't think so.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.943
Going through that once
changed me and all of you.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.237
But if the Judge wasn't going to
listen to us out here,

13:00.321 --> 13:02.698
what makes you think
she'll listen to us in there?

13:02.781 --> 13:04.950
I know one thing
that might keep her attention.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.874
Idiots.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.880
Oh, nuts!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.174
How did I fall for that?

13:20.257 --> 13:21.634
Please have a seat, Your Honor.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.428
I already told you, I am not interested.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.805
Give me one reason
why I should hear you out.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.723
Okay.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.266
Here he is.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.561
Ma'am.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.109
You made me an Olyphant?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.737
I think you should hear them out, Judge.
Only seems fair.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.864
Yeah, you're probably right.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.533
Well played, Janet.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.662
I don't mind taking in the view
when the scenery is so pretty.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.206
-Aw!
-Oh, I should call Shawn for this.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.917
Aw, man!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.419
I had just gotten all the puppies
to climb into the cannon.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.546
All right.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.464
Floor is yours.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.424
So, the problem with the afterlife

14:02.508 --> 14:05.970
is not only that it's cruel,
but that it's final.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.473
You get one shot on Earth, and regardless
of the context of your life,

14:09.557 --> 14:12.810
you're placed somewhere,
usually the Bad Place, forever,

14:12.893 --> 14:14.853
with no chance for redemption.

14:14.937 --> 14:18.566
My neighborhood was built to
torture humans, but it made them better.

14:18.649 --> 14:22.444
We want to create a system
that works that way intentionally,

14:22.528 --> 14:25.823
a system designed to give people
a fighting chance.

14:25.906 --> 14:26.949
-In time--
- Huh?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.118
-Interesting.
- Oh.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.078
Why don't you walk us through it?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.330
Yeah, we're gonna, man. Just chill.

14:33.414 --> 14:38.377
Your time on Earth won't be
a test that you either pass or fail,

14:38.460 --> 14:42.798
but instead a class you take,
and the test will come in the afterlife.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.383
The first part stays the same.

14:44.466 --> 14:48.262
You live your life, screw up
a bunch of stuff, like, a lot of stuff,

14:48.345 --> 14:53.267
to the point where people are like,
"This is messed up, even for Florida."

14:53.350 --> 14:55.978
But you can't hear them,
because you fell into the swamp

14:56.061 --> 14:59.023
trying to spray-paint a Taco Bell logo
on a snapping turtle.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.066
Uh, we rest our case, Your Honor.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.735
-No! No, we--
-No, no, no. No, we don't.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.153
We barely started.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.865
Uh, so, when you die,
you still have a points total,

15:07.948 --> 15:11.660
but in the new system, that number
will serve as a sort of baseline

15:11.744 --> 15:16.332
to determine how hard or easy
your test is.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.876
Sorry, I'm just trying
to play catch-up here.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.879
Who's designing these tests, exactly?

15:21.962 --> 15:26.800
A Good Place architect and
a Bad Place architect will work together

15:26.884 --> 15:30.596
to design a scenario to make you confront
your moral shortcomings.

15:30.679 --> 15:35.517
Like Eleanor's selfishness, Jason's
impulsivity, Chidi's indecisiveness

15:35.601 --> 15:37.895
and my complete inability
to carry off a mod look.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.898
-That's not--
-I know I have other faults,

15:40.981 --> 15:42.524
but that is a big one.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.026
The test could be anything.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.904
Maybe you show up and you're told
you're in the Good Place,

15:46.987 --> 15:48.739
but you know that it's a mistake.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.742
Maybe the test
looks just like your regular life

15:51.825 --> 15:54.078
or a twisted version of your life.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.830
You're presented with these challenges.

15:56.914 --> 16:02.544
You do well or badly, but at the end,
you're given a sort of evaluation.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.673
Yeah, and the architects explain
what you did badly, what you did well,

16:05.756 --> 16:08.425
and then you get rebooted,
and do it again,

16:08.509 --> 16:11.387
and again and again until you ace it.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.305
-In the new--
-Oh, hang on.

16:13.389 --> 16:18.352
It seems to me, if y'all get rebooted,
your memories'll be wiped out.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.645
How are you ever gonna learn anything

16:19.728 --> 16:21.480
if you're always
having to start from scratch?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.857
- Mmm-hmm.
-Good point, Timothy Olyphant.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.526
-Tim's fine.
-'Kay, great.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.737
In the new system,
you will retain a vague memory

16:28.821 --> 16:31.615
of what you learned
in the evaluation sessions.

16:31.699 --> 16:36.078
That information, what you did well
or badly, stays with you, like...

16:37.413 --> 16:39.206
Like a little voice in your head,

16:39.289 --> 16:41.667
helping you become
a better version of yourself.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.794
Okay, that helps. Thank you.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.714
So, our guess is that
with enough chances,

16:46.797 --> 16:50.259
people will eventually make enough good
choices to qualify for the Good Place,

16:50.342 --> 16:52.261
and maybe some never will,

16:52.344 --> 16:54.680
but that's okay,
because everyone gets a fair shot.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.474
Hold the phone.
What are my demons doing this whole time?

16:57.558 --> 17:00.728
I have millions of lava monsters
down there who'll be out of a job.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.356
I ask you, into whose throats
are they supposed to pour lava?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.776
Well, bad news is,
no more throat lava or penis flattenings.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.404
Then, what are we doing to their penises?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.114
Well, largely ignoring them.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.451
You guys are hearing this.
I'm not crazy, right?

17:15.534 --> 17:16.702
No, I mean, it's a fair question.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.537
Whose side are you on, man?

17:18.620 --> 17:21.040
I don't have a dog in this fight,
little lady.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.583
I'm just looking for clarity.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.126
Shawn, you'll all still have jobs.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.546
Bad Place architects
help design the tests.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.132
Rank and file demons, they'll play roles,

17:30.215 --> 17:32.468
just like they did
in my original neighborhood.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.636
And remember how much fun
you had playing the Judge?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.097
I don't know, guys.
You think this'll work?

17:37.181 --> 17:38.974
It sort of already has.

17:39.058 --> 17:43.979
Chidi just had 800 versions of himself
stuffed into his soul at the same time.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.191
I mean, he's a new man.
He's way cooler now.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.569
Uh, I liked the old version, too,
but not as much.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.071
It's not just Chidi, Your Honor.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.864
When I started
in Michael's first neighborhood,

17:53.947 --> 17:57.117
I was nothing more than
a PalmPilot in a cool vest,

17:57.201 --> 17:58.577
but look at me now.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.163
I can hold four humans in my void

18:01.246 --> 18:04.083
and conjure Timothy Olyphant
in the blink of an eye.

18:04.166 --> 18:08.003
Getting rebooted over and over made me
a better not-a-person than I've ever been.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.380
Humans should get the same opportunity.

18:13.050 --> 18:13.926
Well?

18:18.263 --> 18:21.391
Hmm.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.476
Pass!

18:23.811 --> 18:25.896
Well, guys,
I really thought you had it.

18:25.979 --> 18:29.024
It has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie.

18:29.817 --> 18:30.859
Oh.

18:34.905 --> 18:40.702
<i>♪ Gonna erase the Earth</i>
<i>Erase the Earth ♪</i>

18:42.287 --> 18:45.082
I hid the clicker as far away as possible,
but we are seconds away.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.542
I'm so sorry, guys.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.668
Where did Shawn go?

18:47.751 --> 18:50.087
Oh, don't bother.
He's just toying with us.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.714
I know. That's what gives me hope.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.678
Had to do it one last time
before all this goes away for good.

18:57.761 --> 19:01.181
-So, what are you offering me now?
-Nothing. It's over.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.433
-That was our last idea.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.351
Good.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.728
Soon, all your precious humans
will be gone.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.565
Yeah. It's too bad.

19:10.858 --> 19:14.111
Well, congrats, bud. You won.
See you in a billion years.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.948
When humans evolve again, I'll be
right back at your throat, you traitor!

19:18.532 --> 19:20.409
I mean, yeah, I know.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.162
That's why I said,
"See you in a billion years."

19:23.245 --> 19:24.079
Wait.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.498
I'm gonna do the evil speech now.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.541
If you want.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.753
"Since the dawn of time,

19:31.837 --> 19:34.673
good and evil have waged a furious battle,
stemming from..."

19:34.756 --> 19:36.425
This feels stupid
if you're not gonna fight back.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.553
How do you not have another plan?
You've always had another plan.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.013
What's wrong, Shawn?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.225
Okay, fine.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.186
You're gonna make me admit it.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.897
Fighting you is the most fun
I've ever had.

19:49.980 --> 19:50.856
I mean, you know.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.941
You corkscrew your first eyeball,
and you're like,

19:53.025 --> 19:56.111
"Man, I can't believe
they're paying me to do this!"

19:56.195 --> 20:00.032
But by the trillionth, it's like,
"I should have just been a teacher."

20:00.616 --> 20:03.869
And then you go and get the warm fuzzies
about your little humans, and something...

20:04.661 --> 20:05.621
something changed.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.789
I was having fun again.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.044
I'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.503
I know, buddy.

20:14.004 --> 20:18.175
It's hard when things end,
but one way or the other, this is over.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.386
The only question is, what's next?

20:23.138 --> 20:27.768
I heard your speech at Demon-Con.
You know this system stinks.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.396
You wouldn't have let me try the original
experiment if things were working.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.774
Let's try a new way.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.359
Together.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.657
Okay, finally.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.160
For the last time,
I, the Judge of the afterlife--

20:45.244 --> 20:46.995
-Hang on, Your Honor.
-Argh!

20:47.496 --> 20:48.538
Are you kidding me?

20:48.622 --> 20:51.583
Can't a gal just end
all of humanity one time

20:51.667 --> 20:54.086
without everyone getting
all up on her junk?

20:54.169 --> 20:57.381
-What is it, man?
-Shawn has agreed to our proposal.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.883
-Wait, seriously?
- In principle, yes.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.261
-Still some kinks to work in.
-Out.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.137
Out. Sorry, old habits.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.473
But I think we can find a way
to make it work.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.391
Guys, watch this!

21:07.474 --> 21:09.601
- Jason!
- No, no, no.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.646
Sorry. Jeez!

21:13.313 --> 21:14.648
Okay, well...

21:14.731 --> 21:20.237
assuming we are redesigning the entire
afterlife according to this plan,

21:21.321 --> 21:22.531
what do we do first?

21:25.701 --> 21:29.037
Oh, don't look at me.
I'm... I'm just the idea guy.
