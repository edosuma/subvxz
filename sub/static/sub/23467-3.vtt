00:00.934 --> 00:01.001
An FX original series.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.875
The Americans.
The riveting final season.

00:07.908 --> 00:10.678
Premieres March 28 on FX.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.489
Did you find any clowns yet?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.991
I had an idea for a,
for a classified ad.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.094
"Clowns wanted," honey.
That's it.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.395
I didn't ask for any of this.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.397
I'm your neighbor from Awaken.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.031
We're that church next door.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.033
Oh, I've seen your sign.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.169
It's half-past.
Do you think she forgot?

00:35.203 --> 00:37.037
It's always something
down at the rodeo.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.174
EDDIE:
Hup, hup, hup. Hip, hip.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.176
Hup, hup. Ha-ha.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.412
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hyah.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.013
Attagirl, boy.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.416
MRS. BASKETS:
Ah. It's a miracle.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.518
They used to bite me.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.187
You've got to come over
and work with my cats.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.223
*

00:57.558 --> 01:00.261
I've got opening night taffy.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.596
-Thank you. Got to get
to the ticket booth. -Oh, Dale.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.532
Don't be such a hog.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.034
Taffy? I love your wig.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.469
It's so much fun.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.705
Oh, Chip, no smoking.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.108
Hey, taffy's much better
for you.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.476
Thank you.

01:15.509 --> 01:19.713
Hey, I'm Christine Baskets.

01:19.747 --> 01:23.217
Ooh. Well, that's not
very nice. God.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.618
Hey, are you gonna be wearing

01:24.652 --> 01:27.121
this vagabond ragtag thing?

01:27.155 --> 01:30.391
Maybe something a little more
festive opening night?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.093
-If you don't
like me then fire me.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.462
Oh, well, that's no way to be.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.230
What you should say is,

01:36.264 --> 01:38.065
"Hey, maybe I have something
else I can wear."

01:38.098 --> 01:39.800
-I quit.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.669
-Oh, Gregory.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.738
-MRS. BASKETS: Gregory.
-Greg. Greg.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.308
-He's a bad seed.
-Mom.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.277
-Craigslist.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.744
-Yeah.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.313
That's where you get a tire.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.781
Well, you can also find people.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.116
Chip, how much effort have you
put into this?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.319
It seems like you haven't even
done the bare minimum.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.088
-Well, I'm the one that found
Eddie. -Well, that's true.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.691
You know, Eddie did a terrific
job with the horses,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.326
maybe he could help us
with the clowns.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.094
Well, I don't know. I mean...

02:07.127 --> 02:09.163
EDDIE: We're gonna be ready
to open the front gates

02:09.197 --> 02:10.698
in a few minutes here,
Mama Baskets.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.366
MRS. BASKETS: There's
Robert Redford right now.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.369
-Ow. God.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.471
Hey, I saw that.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.173
That's your first warning.

02:19.207 --> 02:22.610
-I quit.
You quit.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.278
-Hey. Doug. -Oh, my God.
They're dropping like flies.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.446
-CHIP: Douglas.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.348
MRS. BASKETS:
Douglas.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.183
EDDIE: This batch of clowns
is a churlish bunch.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.451
Where'd you get these swill?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.152
Craigslist.
I keep telling you guys.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.121
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
That's where you get a tire.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.824
That's what I told him. We're
gonna have a wonderful night

02:36.857 --> 02:38.792
without those clowns.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.562
-CHIP: I don't know

02:41.595 --> 02:44.398
if you read our policy, but, uh,
we do take the tip money.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.866
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:45.899 --> 02:48.402
-Renoir, the clown.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.250
Oh! Ooh! Oh, God. Here you go.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.651
That's Belly Joy.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.885
Those are our horses.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.487
Good job, Eddie.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.256
MRS. BASKETS:
Let's raise our glasses

03:08.289 --> 03:11.492
to the man who takes ponies
and turns them into horses.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.660
-Yeah.
-Oh, get him a drink.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.262
Get him a glass,
get him a glass.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.829
Come on now, Eddie.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.366
You know, you got to drink
a little bit of something.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.667
-Drink 'em up!
-MRS. BASKETS: Drink, drink,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.236
drink!

03:22.270 --> 03:24.204
-Hip hip...
-ALL: Hooray!

03:24.238 --> 03:27.174
-Hip hip...
-Hooray!

03:27.207 --> 03:31.279
MAGGIE: See, Wanda's bringing
brownie bites, so...

03:31.312 --> 03:32.380
:
you can bring celery.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.447
That's all?

03:33.481 --> 03:34.848
Mm-hmm.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.385
Well, I'll see you
at cards, Christine.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.628
Oh, my God.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.930
What the hell?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.400
Jesus.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.207
Oh. Daniel.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.443
Hey, Christine.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.877
MRS. BASKETS:
Ugh.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.780
Those clowns.
I told Chip they were no good.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.417
We'll pay
for the damages, Daniel.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.319
I'm so, so sorry.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.561
EDDIE :
Finally.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.330
A lady's presence.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.232
This was a sausage party.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.500
I'm sick.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.668
I'm so sorry.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.236
Can I have a minute?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.739
-Of course.
-Thank you, Daniel.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.974
Oh. Cinderfella.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.945
Get out.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.448
You're fired.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.751
Thanks for the champagne
and hotdog, Christine.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.486
Oh, the champagne.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.322
Oh, Christine,
what's wrong with you?

04:48.356 --> 04:52.326
Well, on the bright side,
you got a heck of a clown car.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.363
It blasted right through
them big oak doorways

04:55.396 --> 04:56.930
of that Korean church.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.334
Let's get you home.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.502
Where do you live?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.838
I was staying
with the baby goats

05:04.872 --> 05:07.941
in the corner stall
back at the stable.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.812
Goats don't mind.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.614
Let's get out of here.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.282
Come on.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.884
MRS. BASKETS:
There's towels in here,

05:16.917 --> 05:18.552
places you can hang stuff.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.388
You can have either bunk.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.724
Cody liked the bottom bunk,
and Logan liked the top bunk.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.459
It's warmer up there.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.629
I like to sleep naked.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.965
Well, under the bed, then,
for you.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.701
Oh, I got
in a car accident once.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.036
I was nine or 11 or...

05:36.069 --> 05:38.806
I drove the car
right into the hospital.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.973
-Oh.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.409
You know, I was so short,

05:41.442 --> 05:42.976
I couldn't even see
over the wheel,

05:43.010 --> 05:46.914
and I just thought, "Oh,
I'll just drive, and..." bam.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.816
It was crazy.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.852
My dad let me drive,
is the craziest part.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.754
Had a wild side, huh?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.489
:
Yeah.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.859
Christine, I was so awful.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.562
Sorry for being a stinker.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.664
And I'll just...

06:03.697 --> 06:07.668
I'll never get more drunker
again in my life.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.438
That's good.
We're done with that stuff now.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.005
You know,
you remind me of my dad.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.707
And I'm rooting for you.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.010
Oh! My card game with the girls.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.879
There's food in the, uh, fridge.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.549
I'll see you later.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.017
So I'm gonna make you guys key
clowns, which is very exciting.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.419
I know that you're both novices,

06:25.453 --> 06:27.087
but I think
we can make this work.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.389
Uh, we are super honored

06:29.423 --> 06:32.560
that you'd even think of us
to-to ask,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.027
about the clown...
all the-all the clown...

06:34.061 --> 06:36.530
all that clown stuff
you were say-just saying.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.933
That's cool, and you're coo...
we like that... who he is,

06:39.967 --> 06:41.602
-as a guy.
-Mm-hmm.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.873
He's, uh... he's up
for regional manager.

06:47.575 --> 06:51.378
I-I might be running the Arby's
by the airport.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.381
CUSTOMER:
Hello?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.883
JODE:
Okay, well, we got to go.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.951
I got you.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.953
-One second, sir.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.989
TRINITY:
Yeah. Sorry.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.096
Are you okay?

07:12.099 --> 07:14.802
Um, Chip, are you okay?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.837
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.506
Well, I know you had
your hopes up pretty high

07:18.539 --> 07:19.940
that your friends
were gonna help you,

07:19.973 --> 07:22.843
and seems like
they let you down.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.979
-You must feel pretty betrayed.
-Martha.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.916
Do you want me to help you
trash the place?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.152
No. I know you're trying
to make me feel better, Martha,

07:32.185 --> 07:34.087
but it's not working.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.490
-Okay, so you need clowns.
-Yeah.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.791
-I get it.
-Yeah.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.159
Arby's didn't pan out.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.662
What if we try Mickey D's?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.531
Okay. Keep going.

07:43.564 --> 07:47.034
Well, like, uh,
Ro-Ronald McDonald is a clown.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.936
-Come... -Ronald McDonald
is just the mascot

07:48.969 --> 07:50.538
for the restaurants
throughout the world.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.005
I thought
he worked at McDonald's.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.875
God, you're easily marketed to,
you moron.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.710
Well, what if we tried to hire

07:56.744 --> 07:59.179
some of the animatronics
from the Chuck E. Cheese band?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.782
-They're really energetic.
-They don't have a lot of...

08:01.815 --> 08:03.116
They're banjo hacks.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.052
You know,
they just kind of do this.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.454
I don't know
how much clowning they can do.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.790
But what if you could
reprogram them?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.625
Do you have an in
at Chuck E. Cheese?

08:11.659 --> 08:14.494
I know where, like, um... Hmm.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.196
No.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.833
Good meeting.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.007
-Feeling lucky. -No, no, no.
-You always say that.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.642
-You always say that.
-Sorry I'm late.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.177
You can't believe that.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.647
I went to three different stores
to find celery.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.816
There must be a shortage.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.586
-Geez, Louise.
-Hi, sweetie.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.921
Sorry I'm late.

08:40.954 --> 08:44.057
Oh. You're in full swing.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.993
-Oh.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.061
That's good.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.597
Phew. That's a relief.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.931
-Oh.
-Oh.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.066
Oh.
-Oh, I get it. Oh, uh...

08:53.100 --> 08:54.935
-No. -You must be Christine.
-Yeah.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.604
-Hi, honey. I'm Joan.
-This is Joan.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.038
-You know Joan.
-You just stay right there.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.907
I'll get another chair.
I'm fine.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.075
-Oh, no, no, no, no! -Oh, no.
I'm gonna sit right here.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.178
-No, absolutely not. I insist.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.681
-I insist. -No, no, no. -We can
play five-handed something.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.516
-No, I'm...
-Five-handed...

09:09.549 --> 09:10.851
I know what we...
We could, um...

09:10.884 --> 09:12.219
-Let's go to the sofa.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.854
-We could watch a movie.
-Yes, let's do it.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.189
How about... Scream 2?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.058
-Oh, that's a fun one.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.593
Huh? -You'd like that.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.794
-Yes, you'd like it. -Yeah.
That'd be all right.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.162
-That would be fun.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.702
Well, that was
an interesting choice.

09:28.736 --> 09:32.039
Joan's a lot of fun.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.608
And she's reliable.

09:34.642 --> 09:38.712
And you know why I asked you
just to bring the celery?

09:38.746 --> 09:41.548
Because nobody
would be disappointed

09:41.581 --> 09:43.050
if you didn't show.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.885
Well, come on, Maggie.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.621
I'm running a business.
It's a job.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.857
Well, I'm running a card game.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.295
Doesn't mean
we're not still friends.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.233
Why don't I plan
the next card game?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.902
I'll host it.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.304
I'll even make
the cheese and crackers.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.173
Oh.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.810
-Oh.
-Oh.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.746
You know I wanted you
to bring the cheese.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.849
'Cause nobody pairs cheese
with a cracker the way you do.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.586
-You know it's all
in the Triscuits.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.756
Yeah, can I talk to someone
in animatronics, please?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.825
Noodles. Hey.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.794
I want to be a clown, man!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.195
Oh, okay.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.863
I was thinking about
what you said, man.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.598
Like, let's-let's do it, man.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.300
I'm in the zone.
I'm, like, ready to rehearse.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.868
Is Jode coming, too?
Should we wait for him?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.770
No, man. He's, like,
never gonna leave Arby's.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.672
He's in love
with his little...

10:38.706 --> 10:40.173
his little manager job.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.175
He's never gonna leave.

10:42.209 --> 10:46.113
Like, I thought... I thought
I loved him, but, like...

10:46.146 --> 10:48.181
:
...everything's gotten so weird.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.617
Um...

10:50.650 --> 10:52.786
-Okay. Um...

10:52.820 --> 10:54.621
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm pregnant.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.023
:
I'm sorry.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.959
Congratulations.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.130
Yeah, I can't work for...
can't work for Jode anymore.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.898
Like, I've...
I've thought about your offer,

11:04.932 --> 11:06.633
and I want to be a clown.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.135
-Yeah, but you're...

11:08.168 --> 11:11.038
-You're, um...
-Oh, my God.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.074
Are you serious? I can be
pregnant and be a clown, dude.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.710
I'm... like, I'm a women's
libber type... gentleman.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.645
What I was...

11:18.678 --> 11:21.348
Yeah, we'll get started.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.884
Right away. Okay?

11:27.287 --> 11:29.790
Oh. It's gonna be okay.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.936
Oh, Dad's stuff fits you.
That's great.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.205
He was skinny like you.

11:45.238 --> 11:49.342
I got hash browns, sausage,
bacon, eggs.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.912
I got my signature
Mickey Mouse pancakes,

11:51.945 --> 11:56.016
and Flintstones vitamins.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.852
I'll have a Fred,
a Wilma and a dinosaur.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.454
Beautiful. One Dino coming up.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.859
Mom never used to cook
like this for us, yeah.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.361
You should respect your mother.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.398
It's good. Mmm.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.901
Find any clowns?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.269
MRS. BASKETS:
Now tell him

12:16.303 --> 12:18.238
what you told me.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.440
Well, I'm just so damn sorry,

12:20.473 --> 12:24.978
and it had nothing to do
with your race or your religion,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.947
whatever that might be.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.049
Okay.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.784
Just drunk damn fool clown.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.452
I'm sorry.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.721
It'll never happen again.

12:34.754 --> 12:39.893
Thank you so much for the...
those flower holders.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.728
Everything you've done
has just been first-class.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.731
-Costco overstock.
Really appreciate it.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.900
And thank you
for saying what you did.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.837
May I share
a personal experience?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.404
My sister had a drinking problem

12:51.438 --> 12:53.240
where she would go home
with strangers.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.742
-Oh, that's terrible.
-It was.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.078
It was, but AA really helped.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.081
I've heard of AA.
It's a good program.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.850
She hosts a meeting here.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.485
That hand is there for you
if you need it.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.255
No, I don't need any help.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.324
I just won't do the sauce
anymore.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.026
CHRISTINE: Oh, you sound
just like my dad.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.427
"Doesn't need help."

13:14.461 --> 13:17.430
Thank you for coming by
and saying what you did.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.800
I appreciate it.
God bless you.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.773
Do you love her?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.308
Love who?

13:28.341 --> 13:31.511
Claire.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.880
Claire who?

13:32.913 --> 13:34.948
Trinity, dude. Your new clown.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.483
She left Arby's for good.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.888
Are you crying?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.323
:
Be good to her, man.

13:43.356 --> 13:47.127
Let me get you a tissue.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.164
There's some post-nasal drip.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.401
I love her so much.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.803
We did it at Arby's.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.071
Did what?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.806
Sex, man.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.543
Oh. In the restaurant?

14:03.576 --> 14:06.079
No, man, in the parking lot...

14:06.113 --> 14:08.415
by the grease tanks.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.417
Well, maybe I can convince you

14:10.450 --> 14:13.386
to come clown at the,
at the rodeo with us.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.256
She don't want to see me.
She's changed.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.824
It was ever since
the E. coli breakout

14:17.857 --> 14:19.927
when I started making her
wash her hands.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.563
That was the turning point,
is making her wash her hands?

14:23.596 --> 14:26.566
Yeah, man. She don't like
to be told what to do.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.502
Who does?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.108
Chip...

14:37.610 --> 14:40.180
...make me a clown.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.215
Okay.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.553
Welcome to
the Baskets Family Rodeo.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.369
-The stinky cheese is yummy,
Christine. -Mm-hmm.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.871
-The stinkier the better,
I always say.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.873
I bet Joan likes hard cheeses.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.310
-Christine, stop it.
-I won't.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.644
EDDIE:
Honey, I'm home.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.882
:
Who is that?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.550
That's Chip's friend
from the rodeo.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.253
He's terrific with the horses.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.322
EDDIE:
Women playing cards?

15:22.355 --> 15:24.224
I thought I'd never see the day.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.061
That's so silly.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.397
That was interesting.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.932
Do you often have cowboys
from the rodeo

15:32.966 --> 15:34.601
in your home, Christine?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.904
-No. -And do they always smell
like hay?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.506
Or manure

15:42.142 --> 15:44.411
Christine, I need a coat hanger.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.113
-This won't push it through.
-Oh.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.914
CHRISTINE: All right,
I'll take care of it.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.017
-Zip your fly up.
-Oh.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.253
-Ladies.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.089
Good.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.591
Uh, you work at the rodeo?

15:58.625 --> 16:02.462
Yes, sir. Baskets Rodeo.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.598
Oh, my God, you look
just like Brute Johnson,

16:05.632 --> 16:08.435
a bull rider I used
to wrangle around with.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.536
Uh-huh.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.071
Don't she look like him?

16:15.708 --> 16:20.380
Hmm, what's the smelly, yummy,
stinky cheese you got here?

16:20.413 --> 16:23.216
-Oh, my God.
-Mmm.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.952
Eddie, can I talk to you
for a minute?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.055
-Excuse us.
-Mm-hmm.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.956
Hey, I thought it would be fun

16:29.989 --> 16:34.161
if you went and had a meal, got
a shave and saw a movie on me.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.695
-Okay.
-Enjoy yourself.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.697
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.633
Some people are
just so helpless.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.969
MAGGIE: Honey, his pants
were falling down.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.305
WANDA: Totally. I'm completely
worried about that man.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.673
CHIP: Yeah, so you're
just innocently promenading.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.476
Good. Good.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.478
You don't notice him. And Jode,
you're just trying to catch up

16:51.511 --> 16:53.480
because she left her slice
of pizza.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.014
You're not trying to hug her.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.083
JODE: Why won't you
talk to me, Claire?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.650
Baby, what's wrong?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.152
Um, I'm pregnant.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.359
-TRINITY: No!

17:06.393 --> 17:08.661
It's yours, you idiot!

17:08.695 --> 17:11.598
-Does that mean you're coming
back to Arby's? -Oh, man.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.600
See, this is the shit
I'm talking about, dude.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.102
-Okay, okay, okay.
-I can't stand that.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.269
Okay, listen, everybody,
let's just...

17:16.303 --> 17:17.570
JODE:
You want to be a clown?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.005
You're a mom now.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.540
This is what I'm telling you,
this shit.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.742
He's always telling me
what to do!

17:22.775 --> 17:26.713
Look, I don't make up the rules.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.581
I'm not the one that told you

17:28.615 --> 17:31.251
you got to wash your hands
after you use a bathroom.

17:31.284 --> 17:36.022
I mean, I did, but that's
the state of California, not me.

17:36.055 --> 17:40.360
You should be mad at a suit
in Sacramento.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.263
Look, circus
don't have nothing, okay?

17:43.296 --> 17:47.434
Arby's has benefits,
uh, three months paid leave

17:47.467 --> 17:50.036
for mothers.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.638
-Um, expenses paid. -CHIP: Okay,
okay, e-everybody...

17:51.671 --> 17:53.373
Don't you remember that benefits
package I made you watch?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.375
-Come on.
-Hey, guys.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.644
Again, please, let's just
calm down, all right?

17:57.677 --> 18:00.380
You're gonna be parents.
You're gonna be a mom.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.748
-But we should
maybe get back to the,

18:01.781 --> 18:03.716
-to the pizza routine.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.585
-I'm scared you're gonna leave.
-TRINITY: No.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.220
No. No, no, no, no, no.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.721
This is so...
this is so freaking lame.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.056
Are you kidding me?!

18:10.089 --> 18:11.658
-Come on...
-This is lame!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.660
: And you're lame
and you're lame.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.428
JODE:
Claire!

18:15.462 --> 18:18.831
Hey, Trinity, we're not
really done with the whole...

18:22.135 --> 18:24.404
Okay, so, look,
it's just you and I now.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.308
-So, uh...

18:28.341 --> 18:30.076
Are you upset?

18:30.109 --> 18:33.580
Because of what just transpired,
probably, right?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.182
Unless this is part of the act,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.749
which I don't think
is gonna work.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.419
-Um...
-I quit.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.853
Sorry, Chip.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.211
Chip?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.616
EDDIE:
Hi, Mama.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.352
These are my new friends
from the bar.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.687
That's Beatrix

19:14.721 --> 19:16.223
and this guy's name is...

19:16.256 --> 19:18.725
-Tromboso.
-Tromboso.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.461
:
Oh, God, Eddie.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.131
I had some drinks tonight.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.300
(music continues playing,
distorted)

19:27.334 --> 19:29.602
Jimmy, Christine,
let's get in the car.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.173
TROMBOSO:
Dance, Mama.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.409
-Come on. Come on, Mama.

19:36.443 --> 19:40.813
-Oh, lady. Oh.
-Stop it.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.483
MAN: Jimmy, Christine,
let's get in the car.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.169
-Yeah.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.504
CHIP:
Mom.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.707
-Mom.
-Oh.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.676
What are you doing?

20:09.709 --> 20:14.180
We just had a little accident
and I'm just, uh, cleaning up.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.616
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Who are these people?

20:16.649 --> 20:21.421
Christine won't dance with me
and it slurs my feelings.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.691
-Make me sad.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.225
...what is... what's happening?

20:26.259 --> 20:29.696
Okay. Uh, Eddie...

20:29.729 --> 20:32.365
Okay, look, Sid and Nancy,
I'm gonna call you a cab.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.534
You're too old to be partying
with your pants off

20:34.567 --> 20:36.436
on the staircase.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.805
Eddie, you're acting like
some kind of spoiled tween.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.473
You need to go to your room

20:40.507 --> 20:43.209
and-and-and think
about what you've done,

20:43.242 --> 20:45.312
'cause if you want
to work at this rodeo,

20:45.345 --> 20:47.880
then you're gonna have
to make some changes.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.317
It's all my fault.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.387
No, it's not.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.624
You haven't done anything wrong.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.959
Dad.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.932
Uh, hey.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.439
Um, I wanted to get back
on the schedule for this week.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.308
Oh, yeah.
Uh, Izzy is out, I think.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.244
Let me, let me just,
let me see about that.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.314
I'm really sorry
that I got so weird.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.249
I understand that, like,

21:23.282 --> 21:24.917
you're technically
my manager here,

21:24.951 --> 21:30.590
but just,
I can manage myself at home.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.426
Well, yes, ma'am.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.994
Cool.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.597

Cool.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.034

21:46.839 --> 21:49.275
Well, guess I'd better
go find out

21:49.308 --> 21:52.011
what room
this drunk meeting's in.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.647
I'm glad you're getting help.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.683
Okay.

21:56.716 --> 22:00.286
I used to pray that my dad would
go to these kinds of meetings.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.155
Thanks for the ride, Christine.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.412
