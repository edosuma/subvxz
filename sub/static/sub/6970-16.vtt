WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:06.665
That many of you here tonight
came home not to a hero's welcome

00:06.773 --> 00:09.901
but to the hostility of the American people

00:10.010 --> 00:13.002
is a shameful fact of history.

00:20.987 --> 00:25.924
One that l will never understand
or forgive.

00:29.929 --> 00:35.629
But it also underscores our sacred duty,
notjust today but forever,

00:36.503 --> 00:42.237
to honor those who served with honor,
and to remember those who fell.

00:43.043 --> 00:47.912
Men and women whose ultimate sacrifice
must never be forgotten.

00:52.685 --> 00:55.347
There is probably no audience

00:55.422 --> 01:00.792
that understands better
that our freedom is not free.

01:01.594 --> 01:05.792
All right, you're my eyes out there.
Talk to me. Positions report.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.827
- Sector three clear.
- No sign of him in four.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.495
Sector six, report.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.135
Mulder?

01:17.243 --> 01:20.440
- He's here. l feel him.
- Then where is he?

01:20.713 --> 01:24.342
Hold on. l think l have him in section four.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.277
Can you confirm that, Scully?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.519
Positive. He's heading towards you, three.

01:35.628 --> 01:39.257
Positions hold. Three and four,
do you have eye contact?

01:42.001 --> 01:45.027
l have him in three.
He's coming towards you, Scully.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.936
Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.511
Mulder, he saw me.

01:57.217 --> 02:00.380
- He's heading towards the sound booth.
- l'm cutting him off.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.985
Talk to me, people. Does anybody have him?

02:08.527 --> 02:10.689
What's happening, Scully?

02:12.699 --> 02:14.599
l'm closing on him.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.395
- Do you have him in three?
- Negative.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.597
Scully?

02:22.242 --> 02:25.973
- Scully.
- l lost him. You got him, three?

02:26.479 --> 02:28.777
l don't see him, Scully.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.839
What's happening?

02:31.084 --> 02:33.951
- l can't see him anywhere.
- He must be headed your way.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.855
- You got him, Mulder?
- Not yet.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.018
l got him.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.927
l lost him.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.502
Mulder, he's right in front of you.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.873
- He's got a gun.
- General, get off the stage.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.013
l can't see him. l can't see him.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074

04:07.947 --> 04:10.006
Good morning, sir.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.685
All right. Let's go.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.810
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?

05:18.217 --> 05:20.412
What the hell are you...?

05:26.893 --> 05:29.020
Lieutenant General? Sir?

05:42.141 --> 05:46.475
Lieutenant General Peter MacDougal
was shot dead at 0600 this morning.

05:46.546 --> 05:49.640
Forensics reports the wound
was not self-inflicted.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.809
The weapon hasn't been recovered.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.648
The driver, Private First Class
Gus Burkholder,

05:54.721 --> 05:58.248
is currently being held
on suspicion of murder.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.953
Tests confirm the private
did not do the shooting.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.464
There is suspicion of an accomplice,
based on one piece of evidence,

06:05.531 --> 06:09.968
a so-called death card used by soldiers
in Vietnam to mark their kills.

06:10.069 --> 06:14.233
And by Burkholder's possible ties to a
paramilitary group called the Right Hand,

06:14.307 --> 06:17.276
whose stated aim is violent revolution.

06:18.845 --> 06:24.044
We have a high probability of opportunity
for a group like this.

06:24.150 --> 06:29.383
A unique situation that could result
in the very public loss of lives.

06:29.455 --> 06:32.049
Dozens of officials are in Washington today

06:32.158 --> 06:35.150
for a rededication of the
Vietnam Veterans War Memorial.

06:35.228 --> 06:40.131
Unless we can determine a motive, we will
consider any one of them to be a target.

06:40.199 --> 06:43.362
What if Burkholder is telling the truth,
that he's innocent?

06:43.436 --> 06:46.428
Until we find another suspect,
we will pursue the Right Hand

06:46.539 --> 06:48.769
and their leader,
ex-Marine Denny Markham,

06:48.841 --> 06:52.607
in a preemptive strategy to put a stop
to any other plans they've made.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.010
You have Markham's file in front of you.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.017
For obvious reasons, we're
keeping this from the media.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.316
lf you encounter any resistance,
do not engage.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.290
Surveil and call for backup.
Agent Chandler has your assignments.

07:06.359 --> 07:12.320
We have less than 12 hours to prevent any
further execution or loss of life. Understood?

07:12.398 --> 07:15.333
Beckwith and Fontana,
you'll go to Virginia Beach.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.596
Jackson and Miller, go to Alexandria.

07:17.670 --> 07:22.130
Was that for the benefit of the general,
or have you developed a real strategy?

07:22.208 --> 07:24.142
l'm flyin' by the seat of my pants.

07:24.210 --> 07:28.909
You mean there's no procedure
outlined for an invisible assassin?

07:28.981 --> 07:33.145
- Did you talk to Burkholder?
- l convinced him to take a polygraph test.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.686
- And?
- He passed.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.314
The nature of his claims
suggest a false positive.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.826
The tester admitted that the results
are highly interpretive.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.153
You heard his story?

07:42.261 --> 07:46.288
l found his story compelling.
But then l believe the Warren Commission.

07:46.399 --> 07:50.062
lf l have to devise a strategy around
that story, there is no strategy.

07:50.169 --> 07:53.195
Somebody killed the general.
Somebody is not telling the truth.

07:53.272 --> 07:56.639
The man who heads the Right Hand.
Do you have a warrant for him?

07:56.742 --> 07:59.973
- Yes, why?
- Let Mulder and l serve it.

08:02.748 --> 08:05.478
One misstep, Markham
smells a shakedown,

08:05.551 --> 08:09.146
he's gonna disappear and find
another way to push the button.

08:09.222 --> 08:13.283
And l've already seen more dead
soldiers than l ever wanna see.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.152
Mr Markham?

08:44.824 --> 08:48.191
- Who is it?
- Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBl.

08:48.561 --> 08:52.827
- What do you want?
- lt's extremely urgent that we talk to you, sir.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.738
- Mr Markham?
- Gate's unlocked.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.456
You wanted to see me about...?

09:54.594 --> 09:58.462
- The murder of General Peter MacDougal.
- Am l under suspicion?

09:58.531 --> 10:03.434
No, but your group is, and
Private First Class Gus Burkholder.

10:03.502 --> 10:07.404
- ls that a name l should know?
- He's on the mailing list for the Right Hand.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.703
2,000 names on that list. l
can't keep track of every one.

10:10.776 --> 10:15.008
- We'd like to go over that list with you, sir.
- No way you'll be getting that from me.

10:15.114 --> 10:19.175
- We have a copy, if you come with us.
- l'm not going anywhere.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.049
We have a warrant for your arrest
if you don't cooperate.

10:22.121 --> 10:27.582
Under the new antiterrorism law, we can and
will hold you until we get the information.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.764
There goes the neighborhood.

10:41.941 --> 10:45.672
You can make this as easy
or as hard as you wish, sir.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.706
The Right Hand believes in
empowering the individual

10:48.781 --> 10:51.978
over a corrupt and
corrupting federal government.

10:52.051 --> 10:55.851
We're prepared for the time when
armed resistance will be necessary.

10:55.921 --> 10:59.914
Lives will have to be sacrificed.
But that day has not yet come.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.928
- Would you take a polygraph, Mr Markham?
- My word's good enough.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.090
What's your ''word'' on this?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.059
Where'd that come from?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.036
l'd like to ask you that.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.335
More men are gonna die.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.889
This guy's a one-man threat
to national security.

11:32.992 --> 11:36.086
l'll bet he's got more weapons
than most Third World armies.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.926
He told me to pull this photo
from his file cabinet.

11:38.998 --> 11:42.900
- Who's this?
- He says he killed General MacDougal.

11:42.968 --> 11:48.372
Name's Nathaniel Teager.
26 confirmed solo enemy kills.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.742
A veritable killing machine.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.370
Left for dead by the government
that created him.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.414
Left for dead?

11:55.481 --> 11:58.279
He belonged to Green Beret
Detachment B-11,

11:58.384 --> 12:00.909
the squad known as the Bloody Sabers.

12:00.986 --> 12:05.218
ln 1971, the B-11 was being transported
when their chopper was shot down.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.815
No survivors.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.453
- When was this photo taken?
- December 1995.

12:10.529 --> 12:16.559
Just after the Right Hand liberated him
from a POW camp outside the U Minh forest.

12:16.635 --> 12:20.127
l'm sure you're aware that
in 1973 the Defense Department

12:20.206 --> 12:23.505
determined there were
no more POWs in Vietnam.

12:23.576 --> 12:27.569
Maybe that's why they tried to kidnap
Sergeant Teager when we brought him home.

12:27.713 --> 12:30.580
The government kidnapped
a US prisoner of war?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.708
l said they tried.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.480
Had their commandos
board our plane in San Diego.

12:35.554 --> 12:39.923
When they broke into the cargo hold
where we hid him, he was already gone.

12:40.292 --> 12:42.658
l never did figure out how.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.529
l think l've heard enough.

12:56.108 --> 13:00.067
- You don't believe him, do you?
- But what if he's telling the truth?

13:00.146 --> 13:04.276
A phantom POW left for dead
comes back to avenge the injustices?

13:04.350 --> 13:07.945
- Maybe the war ain't over.
- Maybe not Denny Markham's war.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.784
Given the facts of the case
and the polygraph test,

13:10.890 --> 13:13.415
it's the only explanation we've got.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.455
Or it's a clever story
being proffered as a cover-up

13:16.562 --> 13:19.326
for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.525
There is that possibility too.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.699
Let Markham take the polygraph.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.303
- And what if he passes?
- He won't.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.741
Mrs Davenport?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.514
Renee Davenport?

13:41.587 --> 13:42.952
Yes?

13:43.022 --> 13:46.219
Wife of Lance Corporal Gary Davenport
of the Special Forces?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.986
Yes. Do l know you?

13:48.060 --> 13:51.188
No, ma'am. l've come to act in his behalf

13:51.263 --> 13:54.699
for the reason that Gary
remains a prisoner of war.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.968
- Gary's dead.
- No, ma'am.

13:59.371 --> 14:03.239
May you forgive me as you forgive him,
as a man and a soldier,

14:03.909 --> 14:07.174
for restoring the honor
and memory of the B-11.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.747
Oh, my God.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.586
Where did you get these?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.854
Who gave you these?

14:29.235 --> 14:31.362
Hey, where are you?

14:35.641 --> 14:39.543
God... Where are you?
Where'd you go?

14:50.322 --> 14:52.847
ls it true she made a positive lD
from the photo?

14:52.925 --> 14:56.622
- From a fax of it. Do you have the photo?
- Yeah, and copies to distribute.

14:56.695 --> 15:02.497
We've got it out to local law enforcement, but
not to the exclusion of the other suspects.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.329
l thought she lD'd Teager.

15:04.403 --> 15:09.397
She did. But l cannot authorize a strategy
that targets a soldier who's officially dead.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.100
Because his name is on a wall?

15:11.176 --> 15:15.476
Because l spoke with the army forensics lab
where Teager's remains have been stored

15:15.547 --> 15:18.573
since they were recovered
from the crash site.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.141
They have his remains?

15:20.219 --> 15:24.383
Markham may have staged this, finding
somebody vulnerable to pass off his lies.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.288
- Why go to all that trouble?
- To create a decoy?

15:27.359 --> 15:30.123
To divert our attention?
Which seems to be working.

15:30.229 --> 15:33.824
This woman saw someone.
l wanna know who.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.205
- Yes, that's him.
- Are you sure?

15:42.541 --> 15:46.773
Everything he said made it
sound like Gary was still alive.

15:49.515 --> 15:52.006
But that can't be true, can it?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.421
You say he just disappeared?

15:56.488 --> 15:58.581
That's what's so strange.

15:58.657 --> 16:02.525
One minute he's standing right
in front of me, and then he's gone.

16:05.364 --> 16:09.926
What if he was telling the truth?
What if Gary is alive?

16:10.302 --> 16:13.294
l've tried to get on with my life.
l've remarried.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.863
What am l supposed
to tell my husband now?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.377
What am l supposed to do?

16:20.512 --> 16:23.447
- Your eye.
- What?

16:24.116 --> 16:26.914
Oh, my God. What's happening to me?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.977
l think you just burst a capillary.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.982
Scully?

16:34.793 --> 16:38.126
- Can we get Mrs Davenport an eye exam?
- An eye exam? For what?

16:38.197 --> 16:44.295
The man we're looking for, the man she saw,
has a knack for vanishing in plain sight.

16:44.370 --> 16:49.467
She has a subconjunctival hemorrhage,
probably brought on by her emotional state.

16:49.541 --> 16:52.510
And how did she reach that emotional state?

16:52.978 --> 16:57.938
- What about you? What are you gonna do?
- l'm gonna see if we're chasing a dead man.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.792
- Agent Mulder?
- Yes.

17:09.895 --> 17:13.592
Dr Benjamin Keyser. l think
l located what you're looking for.

17:13.699 --> 17:17.829
lt's a miracle l found it.
The record had been partially destroyed.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.900
Two bicuspids and a molar.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.476
This is all that was left at the crash site?

17:25.544 --> 17:29.446
l've seen findings made with far less.
These are Sergeant Teager's teeth.

17:29.515 --> 17:32.006
l checked them with his dental records.

17:32.084 --> 17:37.488
- Can you tell how the teeth were extracted?
- Well, l would assume they were pulled.

17:37.556 --> 17:42.220
On each of these teeth, there's
a pronounced scoring in the enamel.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.729
Here, see for yourself.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.234
- Can you tell if that was pre- or postmortem?
- No, not really.

17:52.337 --> 17:56.797
Then this is presumptive. A finding of death
based on inconclusive evidence.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.606
lt was noted here, even underlined.
''lnconclusive.''

18:00.679 --> 18:03.910
Whoever signed off this death
chose to ignore the facts, huh?

18:03.982 --> 18:08.612
l couldn't tell you who that was.
These records were partially destroyed.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.087
ls there any other way to tell?

18:11.190 --> 18:14.648
Based on the records and the reports
filed at the same time,

18:14.726 --> 18:17.126
we could make a pretty good guess.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.788
Yes?

18:22.167 --> 18:25.330
Yes, just a moment. lt's for you, sir.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.067
Hello?

18:27.206 --> 18:31.165
General Steffan, this is Special Agent
Fox Mulder with the FBl.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.542
We have reason to believe
your life may be in danger.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.839
What are you talking about?

18:36.915 --> 18:40.316
The person responsible for
the murder of General MacDougal

18:40.419 --> 18:42.444
may have chosen to target you.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.386
Based on what information?

18:44.456 --> 18:47.482
A death certificate you may
have put your signature on.

18:48.227 --> 18:52.163
The death certificate
for Sergeant Nathaniel Teager.

18:52.231 --> 18:56.065
l don't know about that, but l'm on
my way to the Pentagon right now.

18:56.135 --> 19:01.471
Sir, l have to ask you to trust my risk
assessment and take every caution.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.632
Right.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.700
Do you know your driver, sir?

19:05.944 --> 19:08.276
Yes. He drives me all the time.

19:08.347 --> 19:12.340
l'm gonna put two FBl agents there
to escort you just as a precaution.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.919
They have my mobile phone number, OK?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.685
How many of you know what a pentagon is?

19:25.130 --> 19:27.655
A pentagon is a shape with five sides.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.201
And the Pentagon is just that.

19:30.269 --> 19:33.238
We're standing right now in section A.

19:33.305 --> 19:39.505
Built in 1941 through an act of Congress,
the Pentagon is virtually a city in itself.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.442
- General, sir.
- Good afternoon.

20:03.735 --> 20:07.501
- All clear, General.
- Thank you, gentlemen. That'll be all.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.116
- Mulder.
- l'm at the Georgetown Medical Center.

20:24.189 --> 20:26.157
Did you find out what made her eye bleed?

20:26.225 --> 20:31.219
No, but the ophthalmologist discovered
something called a transient scotoma.

20:31.630 --> 20:35.088
- Scotoma?
- A floating blind spot.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.933
- What would cause that?
- Any number of diseases can scar the retina.

20:39.004 --> 20:42.269
Diabetes, glaucoma, macular degeneration.

20:42.341 --> 20:45.708
ln turn they create a visual field deficit.

20:47.546 --> 20:51.915
- Does she have any of those diseases?
- lt doesn't appear so.

20:51.984 --> 20:57.354
Don't you think it's odd she'd have
a blind spot she wouldn't have noticed?

20:57.422 --> 20:59.253
Not necessarily.

20:59.358 --> 21:04.159
The processes of the brain fill in, and
the visual cortex compensates conceptually.

21:04.229 --> 21:09.223
- That might account for Teager's vanishing.
- l asked the doctor that. He laughed at me.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.902
Hold on, Scully.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.571
- lt's Mulder.
- Agent Mulder, this is General Steffan.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.543
l found something on my desk.
Something very troubling.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.837
- Where are you?
- ln my office.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.541
The agents l assigned to you -
are they with you?

21:24.616 --> 21:27.050
No. They're just outside.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.580
Call them into your office now, General.

21:30.889 --> 21:32.652
Who put this here?

21:32.724 --> 21:34.988
Listen carefully. l'm on my way there.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.221
General Steffan? General Steffan?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.328
Call an ambulance.

22:20.372 --> 22:25.537
The general's secretary was in here no more
than 15 minutes before the general was shot.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.340
He never saw this card
and he never saw anyone go in,

22:28.447 --> 22:30.972
aside from the general and his agents.

22:31.049 --> 22:34.678
From my cursory exam,
nothing can explain your narrative.

22:34.753 --> 22:39.622
l was on the phone with him. He was shot in
the forehead. He would've seen the shooter.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.990
Not necessarily.
He could've turned and been surprised.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.757
There's too little evidence yet to know.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.355
No scotoma?

22:47.432 --> 22:50.094
lt's beyond my capabilities
to make that analysis.

22:50.168 --> 22:54.264
But somebody's got to explain
how a four-star general

22:54.339 --> 22:58.901
could be killed in the best-guarded
military base in the country.

23:02.080 --> 23:02.842
Sir?

23:02.948 --> 23:06.748
l need both of you out here
to see something. Now.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.352
That's him. That's Teager.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.828
l wanna know how the hell this happened.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.525
Neither of us has a clear explanation, sir.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.694
You knew the general was in danger.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.499
l did everything l could.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.734
- This man is killing at will.
- That's correct, sir.

23:29.808 --> 23:33.141
- He's unstoppable?
- l think Teager has an ability.

23:33.211 --> 23:36.510
The ability to erase himself
from the visual field.

23:36.581 --> 23:40.540
lf he's invisible, then why is he
on this video clear as day?

23:40.619 --> 23:46.922
l think he can hide himself by manipulating
what Scully refers to as a blind spot.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.721
That is conjecture, sir.

23:48.794 --> 23:52.195
- Even when looking at him?
- You might not be able to see him.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.927
US soldiers reported the unexplained
appearance and disappearance

23:56.034 --> 23:58.935
of VC guerrillas.
l've read the dispatches myself.

23:59.037 --> 24:03.565
Maybe Teager learned something
from his captors in 25 years of isolation.

24:07.479 --> 24:10.107
We've got four miles of streets
where 31 officers

24:10.215 --> 24:12.877
are staging for a parade
into Freedom Square.

24:12.951 --> 24:16.409
lf what you're saying is true,
l can't protect these men.

24:16.488 --> 24:17.455
Call it off.

24:17.556 --> 24:21.617
Parade or no parade, the only way
to stop this killer is to catch him.

24:21.693 --> 24:22.717
How?

24:22.794 --> 24:25.422
By finding his next victim before he does.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.846
l am Major General Benjamin Bloch.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.650
He did it again, didn't he?

24:56.761 --> 24:58.524
l told them he would.

24:59.397 --> 25:03.458
According to the FBl,
you know the man they're looking for.

25:06.238 --> 25:09.298
Maybe you can tell me
why they can't find him.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.532
The same reason you can't.

25:12.611 --> 25:16.274
Which l imagine is the same reason
you're here right now.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.782
l am here because people are dying.

25:19.718 --> 25:24.382
Soldiers who dedicated their lives
to the defense of this country.

25:24.456 --> 25:27.254
l guess that's one way of lookin' at it.

25:28.593 --> 25:34.088
As it stands, you are facing charges of
conspiracy to commit homicide and treason.

25:35.333 --> 25:39.497
lf both those fall through, there is
still enough evidence to convict you

25:39.571 --> 25:43.063
for possession and transport of illegal arms.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.576
Are you threatening me?

25:45.644 --> 25:47.441
No.

25:47.546 --> 25:54.611
l am offering you a deal,
for you and the people you represent.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.588
lf you think l've got any sway
with Teager, you're mistaken.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.894
l just need to know what he wants.

26:04.462 --> 26:08.330
You know what he wants, and we
both know you can't give it to him.

26:09.367 --> 26:13.599
Not without dragging that nice, clean
uniform of yours through the mud.

26:18.209 --> 26:21.667
Whatever you do to me
won't change his mind, General.

26:21.813 --> 26:26.841
He's sending a message, and makin' damn
sure everyone hears it loud and clear.

26:29.521 --> 26:30.545
Band.

26:31.289 --> 26:32.221
Band.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.689
Time.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.855
You told me you were in a rush.

27:40.925 --> 27:43.723
Crosstown traffic's snarled up
because of the parade.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.490
You need information on prisoners of war.

27:46.564 --> 27:49.556
- A man named Teager.
- l have no information on him.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.933
- Then why did you come here?
- Tell me what you know.

27:53.138 --> 27:56.471
A POW named Teager may be
carrying out death sentences

27:56.541 --> 27:58.805
against the men that left him in Vietnam.

27:58.943 --> 28:02.709
- Who are those men?
- Generals. Steffan and MacDougal.

28:03.648 --> 28:06.776
- They have a connection.
- What is that?

28:06.851 --> 28:10.787
A recent news story extremely
embarrassing to the US military

28:10.855 --> 28:13.688
about the disposing of
South Vietnamese soldiers.

28:13.758 --> 28:16.226
Men employed by our government as spies

28:16.294 --> 28:19.457
and then left behind enemy lines
to certain death.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.557
Their lives were erased from the records.

28:22.934 --> 28:26.700
By a secret three-man commission
who may now be facing charges.

28:26.771 --> 28:31.333
Whose testimonies might be used
in the calculation of reparations.

28:31.409 --> 28:35.641
Are you saying that our government
wants these officers dead?

28:35.714 --> 28:41.243
- Why would they ask us to protect them?
- Because they know you can't.

28:43.988 --> 28:47.287
Well, who's the third man? l need a name.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.127
- General Bloch.
- General, sir. Stop the car.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.719
What's going on here?

29:25.797 --> 29:28.129
Get out of the car, sir, for your own safety.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.600
- Why?
- Your life might be in danger.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.660
From who?

29:35.006 --> 29:36.997
Shooter. Get down.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.410
- Where? Where is he?
- He was there.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.508
l saw him. l...

29:48.586 --> 29:51.487
lt was him, sir. lt was the man in the photo.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.221
Are you sure?

29:56.294 --> 29:58.956
l saw him, sir. lt was him.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.021
Are you sure?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.685
Hup. Mount.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.219
Call when you find out.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.933
Scully, l heard what happened.
You saved General Bloch's life.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.731
He's doing all right. He's over there.

30:39.804 --> 30:43.467
- You saw somebody on the parade route?
- l'm not really sure.

30:43.541 --> 30:47.841
- You saw him, didn't you? You saw Teager.
- l told you l'm not sure.

30:47.912 --> 30:51.040
But you drew your gun.
You must have been convinced.

30:51.115 --> 30:54.050
How are you so convinced
that Bloch was his next target?

30:54.118 --> 30:56.211
l found out about Bloch from the person

30:56.287 --> 31:00.018
who told me we were never meant
to save Bloch's life.

31:00.091 --> 31:03.083
- What?
- This case. Why has it been dumped on you?

31:03.161 --> 31:06.653
ls heading up an antiterrorism detail
part of yourjob?

31:06.731 --> 31:11.930
- That doesn't prove he was set up.
- They knew Teager would be unstoppable.

31:12.003 --> 31:16.633
- They wanted Skinner to fail?
- And us. They knew you'd bring us in.

31:16.741 --> 31:22.304
The government is not about to sacrifice the
lives of military officers just to discredit us.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.816
- Discrediting us is only secondary.
- Secondary to what?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.648
Maintaining their policy
of denial about POWs,

31:28.720 --> 31:31.416
and silencing the men
who made that policy.

31:31.489 --> 31:35.949
Markham's story is having its intended effect.
You're buying into the lie.

31:36.027 --> 31:39.827
Markham may be the only man
in this case who's telling the truth.

31:39.898 --> 31:44.665
- lf you don't believe me, ask General Bloch.
- Ask me what?

31:45.837 --> 31:49.898
l can't wait here. l'm delivering
the keynote address in five minutes.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.271
You might reconsider.

31:51.376 --> 31:55.335
He won't reconsider. Not going out
would be an admission of guilt.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.746
We still have reason to believe
your life is in danger.

31:58.816 --> 32:02.047
lt's yourjob to protect me still, isn't it?

32:02.120 --> 32:05.783
- That's what we're trying to do.
- Then do yourjob.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.849
General...

32:12.230 --> 32:15.757
All right, people, listen up,
because we don't have much time.

32:15.934 --> 32:20.337
You all know your responsibilities. You
have your sectors and your assignments.

32:28.212 --> 32:32.114
lt gives me great pleasure
to introduce a very special man.

32:32.183 --> 32:36.677
Wounded and decorated for gallantry
in Vietnam, he had an idea.

32:36.754 --> 32:38.278
Teager?

32:38.389 --> 32:40.687
To create a national memorial...

32:40.758 --> 32:42.191
Hey, man, is that you?

32:42.260 --> 32:45.855
..for all Americans who gave their lives
in the Vietnam War.

32:46.264 --> 32:47.288
Hey, where ya goin'?

32:50.234 --> 32:51.861
Hey, where ya goin'?

32:51.936 --> 32:56.032
The founder of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund,

32:56.107 --> 32:58.268
Mr Jan Scruggs.

33:01.179 --> 33:04.979
- Teager?
- Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

33:05.049 --> 33:10.681
We are here to rededicate this memorial
on this important day.

33:10.755 --> 33:14.589
We especially remember those
who cannot share this day with us.

33:14.692 --> 33:18.788
- The soldiers, the airmen, the sailors.
- Hey, Teager.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.993
lt's me - Leo Danzinger.

33:26.404 --> 33:29.396
l saw you, man. Where are ya?

33:31.642 --> 33:33.473
Behind you.

33:36.714 --> 33:39.478
l... l thought you were dead.

33:40.084 --> 33:42.746
That's what they told us.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.755
That's what they wanted you to believe.

33:45.823 --> 33:50.954
- l don't understand.
- You will. After tonight.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.659
What are you talkin' about?

33:53.731 --> 33:57.292
l waited for them, Leo.
l waited for them to come.

34:00.438 --> 34:01.905
But they never came.

34:01.939 --> 34:05.602
- Maybe they didn't know.
- They knew.

34:05.676 --> 34:10.340
They just figured letting me die off
was easier than admitting the truth.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.574
lt's all over, Teager.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.083
lt's been over for a long time now.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.882
Not for me.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.184
Not for the others.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.592
You're tellin' me there's more?

34:39.043 --> 34:41.101
What are you doin', man?

34:43.581 --> 34:44.478
Where are ya?

34:45.216 --> 34:47.581
lt is an honor to present to you now

34:47.652 --> 34:51.452
another great American
and a brother in arms,

34:51.556 --> 34:54.024
Major General Benjamin Bloch.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.376
Admiral Leitch,

35:18.249 --> 35:20.012
Senator Baine,

35:21.119 --> 35:23.144
fellow Americans,

35:23.221 --> 35:25.951
and, especially, the veterans.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.588
There is probably no audience

35:32.663 --> 35:37.066
that understands better
that our freedom is not free.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.568
You're my eyes out there.
Positions report.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.367
We owe that freedom
to the selfless sacrifice...

35:42.440 --> 35:47.036
- Sector three clear.
- No sign of him in four.

35:47.111 --> 35:51.377
And it is our duty to remember them.

35:51.516 --> 35:54.917
Hold on. l think l have him in section four.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.247
Can you confirm that, Scully?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.455
Positive. He's heading towards you, three.

36:06.564 --> 36:10.056
Positions hold. Three and four,
do you have eye contact?

36:12.803 --> 36:16.239
l have him in three.
He's coming towards you, Scully.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.677
Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.

36:25.049 --> 36:26.516
Mulder, he saw me.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.520
- He's heading towards the sound booth.
- l'm cutting him off.

36:31.589 --> 36:34.353
Talk to me, people. Does anybody have him?

36:39.363 --> 36:41.354
What's happening, Scully?

36:43.467 --> 36:45.594
l'm closing on him.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.430
- Do you have him in three?
- Negative.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.433
Scully?

36:52.743 --> 36:56.839
- Scully.
- l lost him. You got him, three?

36:57.582 --> 36:59.982
l don't see him, Scully.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.575
What's happening?

37:02.086 --> 37:04.884
- l can't see him anywhere.
- He must be headed your way.

37:05.089 --> 37:07.057
- You got him, Mulder?
- Not yet.

37:10.261 --> 37:11.455
l got him.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.299
l lost him.

37:20.371 --> 37:22.896
Mulder, he's right in front of you.

37:23.841 --> 37:27.333
- He's got a gun.
- General, get off the stage.

37:33.951 --> 37:35.816
l can't see him.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.921
Teager's here. l saw him.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.220
He's gone. He's gone.

37:42.326 --> 37:48.390
No cause for alarm, ladies and
gentlemen. Just a minor disturbance.

37:48.466 --> 37:50.161
- Where's Bloch?
- With Skinner.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.429
- We gotta stop him.
- What's going on?

37:52.503 --> 37:56.234
He can only hide himself
in somebody's direct line of sight.

37:56.307 --> 38:00.539
That's why he killed MacDougal
and Steffan at close quarters.

38:05.916 --> 38:09.010
Get away from the car. Teager's in the car.

38:09.587 --> 38:11.487
Get down. Get down.

38:13.291 --> 38:19.355
Get out of the car with your hands in the air.
lt's over, Teager. Come on out.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.736
Get an ambulance over here.

39:11.982 --> 39:14.576
Teager, Nathaniel J.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.986
Sergeant, Green Beret Detachment B-11.

39:19.423 --> 39:23.484
Service number 82278.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.756
Date of birth March 7, 1952.

39:32.970 --> 39:36.406
Sergeant, Green Beret Detachment B-11.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.441
Service number 82278.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.707
March 7, 1952.

40:19.483 --> 40:22.850
The Pentagon claims that the man
who was killed was Thomas Lynch.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.481
A vet who's been in and out of VA
psychiatric hospitals for 15 years.

40:26.557 --> 40:30.653
A sometime member of the Right Hand.
He was on Denny Markham's mailing list.

40:30.728 --> 40:34.687
- Markham made a positive lD.
- They must've gotten to him.

40:35.232 --> 40:37.996
Army Forensics claims to have confirmation.

40:38.068 --> 40:41.595
You heard him. We both did.
lt's happening all over again.

40:41.672 --> 40:44.436
They're covering the lies,
to make him invisible.

40:44.542 --> 40:49.206
We've gotta subpoena Markham and Bloch,
and petition for the release of Teager's body.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.544
l can't do that, Agent Mulder.

40:52.249 --> 40:53.648
Why not?

40:53.717 --> 40:57.380
This has been turned over to ClD.
lt's no longer ourjurisdiction.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.253
- Don't let them do this.
- Let it go. You did yourjob.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.221
So did Nathaniel Teager.

41:02.493 --> 41:05.360
You found the man,
but now he's dead. lt's over.

41:05.496 --> 41:07.691
ls that what you believe?

41:08.399 --> 41:11.027
ls that what you really believe?

41:11.735 --> 41:16.638
They're notjust denying this man's life.
They're denying his death.

41:16.707 --> 41:21.201
And with all due respect, sir,
he could be you.
