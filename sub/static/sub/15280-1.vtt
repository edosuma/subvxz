01:00.120 --> 01:01.485
HEY.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.180
WOW!

01:05.830 --> 01:07.855
HEY, I'M HEATHER.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.221
NICE TO
MEET YA.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.389
IT'S A 2.4 LITER
6-CYLINDER ENGINE.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.260
WITH HITACHI
SIDE-DRAFT CARBS.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.561
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.306
WANNA TAKE A LOOK
UNDER THE HOOD?

01:21.340 --> 01:22.477
YEAH !

01:22.510 --> 01:24.842
YOU KNOW YOUR Zs.
I'M IMPRESSED.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.269
YOU SHOULD
HAVE YOUR MECHANIC
CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.346
HOW 'BOUT I LEAVE YOU
MY NUMBER AND WE CAN
SET IT UP?

01:30.390 --> 01:32.085
THANK YOU.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.209
SO IT'S JUST...
RIGHT UP HERE.

01:50.270 --> 01:51.908
OH! THAT WAS--
HA HA...

01:51.940 --> 01:55.330
HELLO! THERE WAS
THE RIGHT.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.875
UH, MAYBE JUST...
PULL OVER HERE,

01:57.910 --> 02:01.209
AND WE CAN TRY AND DO
A U-TURN.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.858
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.555
OK.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.262
STOP THE CAR NOW.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.407
PULL OVER NOW!

02:34.680 --> 02:36.341
AAH!

02:42.390 --> 02:44.927
HOW 'BOUT ANDREW?
IT'S GREEK FOR VALIANT.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.428
LET'S CALL HIM...SERGIO.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.429
HA HA! PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE KIDDING.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.289
BUTCH?

02:51.330 --> 02:53.264
HOW ABOUT DONALD?
HANS.

02:53.300 --> 02:56.201
NO! WAIT, WAIT. UM...

02:56.240 --> 02:57.832
OK. GIDEON.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.770
NOT A CHANCE.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.675
IT'S HEBREW.
LOOK WHAT IT MEANS.

03:01.710 --> 03:04.543
IT'S PERFECT.
GIDEON HOTCHNER.

03:04.580 --> 03:05.842
NO.
YES.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.370
YES.
NO.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.546
GIDEON.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.395
19405.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.819
HE PUT BOMBS
IN TRAIN STATIONS
AND MOVIE THEATERS.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.826
UH, THE MAD BOMBER.
GEORGE METESKY.

03:25.870 --> 03:28.634
NICE. THE WINNERS SIT.
LOSERS, DRINK.

03:28.670 --> 03:29.500
CHEERS.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.599
HOLD ON. METESKY
WASN'T A SERIAL KILLER.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.301
NONE OF HIS BOMBS
EVER KILLED ANYONE.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.507
TRUST ME, WE COVER
THE WHOLE SPECTRUM
OF PSYCHOS.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.518
WE PROFILED THE D.C. SNIPER,
THE UNABOMBER.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.017
WE DO TERRORISTS, ARSONISTS--

03:41.050 --> 03:43.712
SUPERVISORY AGENTS
TRYING TO GET
TRAINEES DRUNK?

03:45.420 --> 03:46.887
'SCUSE ME.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.923
WERE YOU WITH HIM
IN BOSTON?

03:54.960 --> 03:57.394
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

03:57.430 --> 04:01.469
YEAH. THIS IS MORGAN.

04:02.540 --> 04:05.600
ANYONE
RECOGNIZE THESE FACES?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.005
VICTIMS
OF THE FOOTPATH KILLER.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.031
THAT'S WHAT VIRGINIA
NEWSPAPERS ARE CALLING HIM.

04:09.080 --> 04:13.540
WE REFER TO HIM
AS THE UNKNOWN SUBJECT
OR UNSUB.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.616
I TOLD VIRGINIA P.D...

04:15.650 --> 04:19.359
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A WHITE MALE IN HIS 20$...

04:19.390 --> 04:22.359
WHO OWNS AN AMERICAN-MADE TRUCK
IN DISREPAIR.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.620
WORKS A MENIAL JOB.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.358
I TOLD 'EM
WHEN YOU FIND HIM...

04:27.400 --> 04:30.665
DON'T BE SURPRISED
TO HEAR HIM SPEAK
WITH A SEVERE STU'I'I'ER.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.828
NOT TO SOUND SKEPTICAL,
BUT COME ON...

04:33.870 --> 04:35.735
A STU'I'I'ER?

04:35.770 --> 04:38.330
WHERE'D THE MURDERS OCCUR?

04:38.370 --> 04:40.338
HIKING PATHS. ISOLATED.

04:40.380 --> 04:45.079
IF I'M A KILLER WHO HAS TO
USE AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION
OF OVERPOWERING FORCE,

04:45.110 --> 04:47.374
EVEN OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE,

04:47.420 --> 04:48.739
I LACK CONFIDENCE.

04:48.780 --> 04:52.489
I CAN'T CHARM THEM
INTO MY CAR
LIKE TED BUNDY DID.

04:52.520 --> 04:57.480
I CAN'T BECAUSE I AM
ASHAMED OF SOMETHING.

05:01.460 --> 05:02.722
EXCUSE ME.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.022
THEY'RE CALLING HIM
THE SEATTLE STRANGLER.
4 VICTIMS IN 4 MONTHS.

05:05.070 --> 05:08.494
HE KEEPS 'EM ALIVE 7 DAYS.
THE HANDLE SERVES
AS A CRANK.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.532
ALLOWING HIM
TO CONTROL THE RATE
OF SUFFOCATION.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.106
TO PROLONG IT?
TO ENJOY IT.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.368
SEATTLE'S HIT A WALL?

05:14.410 --> 05:17.072
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
IS NONEXISTENT. THERE
ARE NO TANGIBLE LEADS.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.943
AND ANOTHER GIRL
IS MISSING.

05:21.450 --> 05:24.578
I LOOKED THE CASE FILE OVER.
I'LL GET SOME THOUGHTS
TO YOU ASAP.

05:24.620 --> 05:28.010
YOU'RE GONNA BE WITH US
IN SEATTLE ASAP.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.992
22-YEAR-OLD
HEATHER WOODLAND.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.224
BEFORE SHE LEFI'
FOR LUNCH,

05:36.260 --> 05:39.764
SHE DOWNLOADED AN EMAIL
WITH A TIME-DELAYED
VIRUS ATTACHED.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.859
THE KILLER'S VIRUS
WIPED HER HARD DRIVE

05:41.900 --> 05:44.539
AND LEFI' THIS
ON THE SCREEN.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.818
"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,
CATCH ME BEFORE I KILL MORE.

05:53.850 --> 05:57.547
I CANNOT CONTROL MYSELF."

06:00.520 --> 06:02.727
HE NEVER KEEPS THEM
FOR MORE THAN 7 DAYS,

06:02.760 --> 06:06.548
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
FEWER THAN 36 HOURS
TO FIND HER.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.922
THEY WANT YOU BACK
IN THE SADDLE.
YOU READY?

06:09.970 --> 06:12.461
LOOKS LIKE
MEDICAL LEAVE'S
OVER, BOSS.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.491
THEY SURE
THEY WANT ME?

06:14.540 --> 06:18.101
THE ORDER CAME
FROM THE DIRECTOR.

06:22.710 --> 06:26.476
WELL, WE'D BE'I'I'ER
GET STARTED.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.891
JOSEPH CONRAD SAID,

06:40.930 --> 06:43.819
"THE BELIEF
IN A SUPERNATURAL
SOURCE OF EVIL

06:43.870 --> 06:45.098
"IS NOT NECESSARY.

06:45.130 --> 06:49.567
MEN ALONE ARE QUITE CAPABLE
OF EVERY WICKEDNESS."

06:51.810 --> 06:53.072
THIS GIRL MAY ONLY
HAVE 36 HOURS TO LIVE.

06:53.110 --> 06:55.931
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR
A JUDGMENT OF GIDEON.
WE WANT AN ASSESSMENT.

06:55.980 --> 07:00.610
WE WANT TO KNOW
YOU'RE THERE TO STEP IN
IF HE CAN'T PERFORM.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.845
ARE WE CLEAR?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.949
OF COURSE.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.757
HIS FIRST VICTIM
WAS 26-YEAR-OLD
MELISSA KIRSH.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.189
STAB WOUNDS,
STRANGULATION.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.390
WAIT, WAIT.
BACK UP. BACK UP.

07:14.430 --> 07:17.194
HE STABBED HER...
AND THEN STRANGLED HER
TO FINISH HER OFF?

07:17.230 --> 07:19.027
OTHER WAY AROUND.
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE STARTED

07:19.070 --> 07:20.867
USING THE BELT WITH
THE SECOND MURDER?

07:20.900 --> 07:22.731
STRANGULATION
WITH YOUR BARE
HANDS

07:22.770 --> 07:23.998
IS NOT AS EASY
AS ONE WOULD
BELIEVE.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.702
HE TRIED, PROBABLY
FOUND THAT IT TOOK
TOO LONG...

07:26.740 --> 07:27.809
SO HE STABBED HER
INSTEAD.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.070
AND REALIZED
IT WOULD BE HOURS
CLEANING UP THE BLOOD.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.977
NEXT TIME,
OUR BOY'S GOT A METHOD--
THE BELT.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.649
HE'S LEARNING,
PERFECT ING HIS SCENARIO.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.750
BECOMING A BETTER KILLER.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.157
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TAPE?

07:51.800 --> 07:52.698
AAH!

07:52.740 --> 07:54.799
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,

07:54.840 --> 07:56.660
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.531
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY!

07:59.580 --> 08:00.706
I'M SORRY!

08:03.780 --> 08:06.647
AAH! AAH!

08:06.680 --> 08:13.188
AAH!

08:32.310 --> 08:34.778
HE NEVER STANDS
WITH HIS BACK
TO A WINDOW.

08:34.810 --> 08:36.744
WHEN I WAS BETWEEN
HIM AND A DOORWAY,
HE ASKED ME TO MOVE.

08:36.780 --> 08:40.272
THAT'S HYPER VIGILANCE.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN POST
TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.618
JUST HOW MUCH
DISORDER ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

08:42.650 --> 08:45.949
MORGAN,
IT'S BEEN 6 MONTHS.
EVERYTHING'S OK.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.753
THIS IS
SPECIAL AGENT GIDEON,

08:47.790 --> 08:50.679
SPECIAL AGENT MORGAN,
OUR EXPERT ON
OBSESSIONAL CRIMES,

08:50.730 --> 08:51.822
SPECIAL AGENT REID.

08:51.860 --> 08:52.724
DR. REID.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.728
DR. REID, OUR EXPERT ON,
WELL, EVERYTHING,

08:54.760 --> 08:57.558
AND AFTER 2 YEARS
BUSTING MY BUT!"
IN THIS OFFICE,

08:57.600 --> 08:59.192
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER ME.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.562
HE'S WILLING TO TRAVEL
WITH THE BODY.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.761
THEN HE DRIVES A VEHICLE
CAPABLE OF CONCEALING ONE.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.574
1 IN 7.4 DRIVERS
IN SEATTLE OWNS AN SUV.

09:06.610 --> 09:07.975
EXPLORER
WITH TINTED WINDOWS.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.841
EXPLORERS
RATE HIGHER WITH WOMEN.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.939
BUT
HOW DO WE KNOW
IT'S HIS CAR?

09:11.980 --> 09:13.777
TED BUNDY DROVE
A WV BUG.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.640
WHAT ABOUT
A JEEP CHEROKEE?

09:15.680 --> 09:16.908
JEEPS ARE MORE
MASCULINE.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.657
WE ALL KNOW HOW
AN UNSUB FEELS ABOUT
ASSERTING HIS MASCULINITY.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.988
WHEN DID THE BUREAU
BECOME INVOLVED
IN THE CASE?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.089
AFTER THE FOURTH BODY.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.121
HE DUMPED THAT ONE
OUT OF STATE.

09:25.160 --> 09:25.888
ON PURPOSE.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.124
IF SO, KNOWLEDGE
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

09:27.160 --> 09:28.821
DOES SUGGEST
A CRIMINAL RECORD.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.862
OR THAT HE WATCHES
TELEVISION. MAY I?

09:30.900 --> 09:32.299
SO YOU WANNA SEE
OUR SUSPECT LIST?

09:32.330 --> 09:33.934
NO, WE WON'T LOOK
AT A SUSPECT LIST

09:33.970 --> 09:35.699
UNTIL AFI'ER WE COME UP
WITH A PROFILE.

09:35.740 --> 09:36.604
IT KEEPS OUR PERSPECTIVE
UNBIASED.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.837
WHEN DO WE SIT DOWN
WITH YOUR TASK FORCE?

09:39.880 --> 09:40.608
00.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.609
00 TODAY?

09:43.650 --> 09:45.072
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

09:45.110 --> 09:49.615
AGENT GIDEON,
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE
TO START?

09:50.990 --> 09:55.211
LET'S START AT THE SITE
OF THE LAST MURDER.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.794
SO THAT'S GIDEON?
THE GIDEON.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.765
THE ONE WHO CAUGHT
THAT GUY, ADRIAN BAAL,

10:05.800 --> 10:06.767
IN BOSTON.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.665
YEP. THAT'S HIM.

10:08.700 --> 10:13.103
BUT CATCHING HIM
COST US 6 AGENTS.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.918
22-YEAR-OLD ANNE CUSHING
WAS FOUND RIGHT HERE.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.894
NAILS CLIPPED
JUST LIKE THE OTHERS.

10:35.930 --> 10:37.921
HE WANTS THEM
TO FIGHT BACK.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.666
BUT NOT
ENOUGH TO HURT HIM.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.804
AND HE LEFI' THE BELT
AROUND HER NECK.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.967
HE'S PROBABLY
IN HIS EARLY 20$.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.672
WHAT'S YOUR REASONING?

10:48.480 --> 10:51.176
YOUTHFUL ARROGANCE.

10:52.050 --> 10:55.372
HE CLOTHED THE BODY
BEFORE DUMPING IT.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.442
THAT'S A SIGN
OF REMORSE.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.084
IT'S NOT CONSISTENT.
LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.953
HIS OPINION OF WOMEN
IS PRETTY CLEAR,
DON'T YOU THINK?

11:02.990 --> 11:04.423
THEY'RE DISPOSABLE.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.429
WHY SHOW REMORSE
BY TAKING THE TIME
TO DRESS HER

11:07.460 --> 11:11.021
BUT THEN DUMP HER HERE?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.367
SANDY, NO, NO, NO.
I'M SO SORRY.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.960
NO, IT'S OK.
IT'S WHAT WE CALL
THE REID EFFECT.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.035
HAPPENS WITH CHILDREN,
TOO. I'M AGENT HOTCHNER.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.069
THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT
DR. REID.

11:21.110 --> 11:23.840
YOU LOOK TOO YOUNG
TO HAVE GONE
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.404
THEY'RE Ph.D.S.
3 OF THEM.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.270
ARE YOU A GENIUS
OR SOMETHING?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.469
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT INTELLIGENCE

11:28.520 --> 11:30.988
CAN BE ACCURATELY
QUANTIFIED--BUT I DO
HAVE AN I.Q. OF 187

11:31.020 --> 11:35.787
AND AN EIDETIC MEMORY
AND CAN READ 20,000
WORDS PER MINUTE.

11:36.390 --> 11:39.052
YES, I'M A GENIUS.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.952
SAN DY, YOU GET A LOT
OF ATTENTION, DON'T YOU?

11:42.000 --> 11:42.921
YEAH, HEATHER
LOVES THIS DOG.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.722
I FEED HER
WHEN HEATHER'S AWAY.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.068
USUALLY, SHE'S FINE,
BUT...LATELY,
SHE WON'T EAT.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.967
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
SHE CAN SENSE
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

11:50.010 --> 11:50.931
NOT SENSE.
SMELL.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.904
OUR APOCRINE
SWEAT GLAND
RELEASES SECRETIONS

11:52.940 --> 11:54.339
IN RESPONSE
TO EMOTIONAL STRESS.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.747
SAN DY'S WORRIED
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS YOU ARE.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.339
DAVID, DOES YOUR SISTER
DRIVE A DATSUN Z?

12:00.380 --> 12:04.441
NO, BUT SHE'S IN
THE MARKET FOR ONE.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

12:06.290 --> 12:09.088
COME ON, SANDY.

12:10.030 --> 12:14.751
THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED
BETWEEN A BUYER AND A SELLER,

12:14.800 --> 12:15.721
A LEVEL OF TRUST.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.991
IF I WANT TO COAX
A YOUNG WOMAN INTO MY CAR...

12:19.030 --> 12:20.497
OFFER HER A TEST DRIVE.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.909
OK, THEN HOW 'BOUT THE FACT
THAT ON ONE HAND, WE HAVE
PARANOID PSYCHOSIS...

12:24.940 --> 12:26.498
BUT THE AUTOPSY PROTOCOL
SAYS WHAT?

12:26.540 --> 12:30.203
ADHESIVE RESIDE SHOWS
HE PUT LAYER AFTER LAYER
OF DUCT TAPE

12:30.250 --> 12:31.478
OVER HIS VICTIMS' EYES.

12:31.510 --> 12:34.308
HE KNOWS HE WANTS
TO KILL THEM, BUT HE STILL
COVERS THEIR EYES.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.147
HE DOESN'T WANT 'EM
LOOKING AT HIM, APPARENTLY.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.411
OK, BUT THEN HE TAKES
THE BODY AND DUMPS IT
RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN,

12:39.450 --> 12:40.815
MURDER WEAPON NEARBY.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.986
NOT THE M.O.
OF A PARANOID

12:42.020 --> 12:43.226
CONVINCED
HE'S BEING WATCHED
OR SURVEILLED.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.387
PARANOID PSYCHOSIS,
BUT BEHAVIOR
THAT'S NOT PARANOID.

12:45.430 --> 12:46.681
MAYBE
HE'S SCHIZOPHRENIC.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.550
MAYBE WE JUST
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A COMPLETE PROFILE.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.862
WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO NARROW OUR LIST
OF SUSPECT S.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.358
WE'RE LOOKING AT LESS
THAN 12 HOURS TO HAVE
TO FIND THIS WOMAN.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.867
WE DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT--

12:54.900 --> 12:56.561
HOTCH, WE DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING!

12:56.600 --> 12:57.237
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

12:57.270 --> 13:01.001
LET'S TELL THEM
WE'RE READY.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.906
WE'RE READY?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.081
REID.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.280
YOU'RE GOOD WITH THIS?

13:11.320 --> 13:12.787
WE'VE GOT A WOMAN
WHO'S ONLY GOT A FEW
HOURS LEFT TO LIVE,

13:12.820 --> 13:16.415
AN INCOMPLETE PROFILE, AND
A UNIT CHIEF ON THE VERGE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.952
THEY DON'T CALL THEM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS
ANYMORE.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.525
IT'S CALLED A MAJOR
DEPRESSIVE EPISODE.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.063
I KNOW, REID.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.003
THE UNIDENTIFIED SUBJECT
IS WHITE AND IN HIS LATE 20$.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.429
HE'S SOMEONE
YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE AT FIRST.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.109
HE'S SOMEONE WHO'D BLEND
INTO ANY CROWD.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.342
THE VIOLENT NATURE
OF THE CRIME

13:40.380 --> 13:42.439
SUGGESTS A PREVIOUS
CRIMINAL RECORD--

13:42.480 --> 13:44.983
PETTY CRIMES.
MAYBE AUTO THEFT.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.989
WE'VE CLASSIFIED HIM
AS AN ORGANIZED KILLER--

13:48.020 --> 13:51.148
CAREFUL. PSYCHOPATHIC
AS OPPOSED TO PSYCHOTIC.

13:51.190 --> 13:54.091
HE FOLLOWS THE NEWS,
HAS GOOD HYGIENE.
HE'S SMART.

13:54.130 --> 13:57.258
'CAUSE HE'S SMART,
THE ONLY PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE YOU'LL FIND

13:57.300 --> 13:59.495
IS WHAT HE WANTS YOU
TO FIND.

13:59.530 --> 14:02.067
HE'S MOBILE,
CAR IN GOOD CONDITION.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.000
OUR GUESS--JEEP CHEROKEE,
TINTED WINDOWS.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.565
THE MURDERS
HAVE ALL INVOLVED RAPES.

14:06.610 --> 14:09.078
BUT RAPE WITHOUT PENETRATION

14:09.110 --> 14:12.602
IS A FORM OF PIQUERISM,
AND THAT TELLS US
HE'S SEXUALLY INADEQUATE.

14:12.650 --> 14:17.041
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATIONS
WILL SHOW A HISTORY
OF PARANOIA

14:17.090 --> 14:19.183
STEMMING FROM
A CHILDHOOD TRAUMA--

14:19.220 --> 14:23.589
DEATH OF A PARENT
OR FAMILY MEMBER.

14:25.130 --> 14:29.157
AND NOW HE FEELS
PERSECUTED AND WATCHED.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.569
MURDER GIVES HIM
A SENSE OF POWER.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.092
ORGANIZED KILLERS
HAVE A FASCINATION

14:36.140 --> 14:38.005
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.306
THEY WILL INJECT THEMSELVES
INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.343
THEY WILL EVEN COME FORWARD
AS WITNESSES

14:45.380 --> 14:48.372
TO SEE JUST HOW MUCH
THE POLICE REALLY KNOW.

14:48.420 --> 14:53.414
THAT MAKES THEM FEEL
POWERFUL, IN CONTROL.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.509
WHICH IS WHY I ALSO THINK...

14:56.560 --> 14:59.028
IN FACT, I KNOW...

14:59.060 --> 15:03.895
YOU HAVE ALREADY
INTERVIEWED HIM.

15:19.510 --> 15:20.511
HI.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.347
I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.642
I'M HOUSE-SITTING
DOWN THE STREET,

15:23.690 --> 15:26.215
AND WHEN I GOT BACK,
THE DOOR WAS WIDE
OPEN,

15:26.250 --> 15:27.956
AND THE LIGHTS
WEREN'T WORKING.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.720
I FEEL STUPID
ASKING THIS,

15:30.760 --> 15:31.749
BUT IS THERE SOMEONE

15:31.790 --> 15:34.691
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TAKE A LOOK
INSIDE WITH ME?

15:34.730 --> 15:39.520
RICHARD. RICHARD,
GET DOWN HERE!

15:44.040 --> 15:46.406
ARE YOU SURE
YOU LOCKED IT?

15:46.440 --> 15:48.499
YEAH.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.142
HELLO?

16:12.300 --> 16:13.096
HELLO!

16:13.140 --> 16:14.596
FBI! FREEZE!
FREEZE!

16:15.670 --> 16:17.433
GET HIM DOWN!

16:17.470 --> 16:19.563
RICHARD SLESSMAN, FBI.

16:19.610 --> 16:23.478
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER...

16:27.550 --> 16:30.439
EMERSON SAID, "ALL IS RIDDLE,

16:30.490 --> 16:35.587
AND THE KEY TO A RIDDLE...
IS ANOTHER RIDDLE."

16:38.190 --> 16:39.657
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF THE GIRL HERE.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.157
WE CAN ARREST HIM
WITH PROBABLE CAUSE,

16:41.200 --> 16:42.519
BUT WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO HOLD HIM.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.563
SLESSMAN'S BEEN
AT THE TOP OF
THE SUSPECT LIST.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.692
IS THAT THE MOTHER?

16:46.730 --> 16:49.233
GRANDMOTHER. THE MOTHER
DIED IN A FIRE
WHEN HE WAS 13.

16:49.270 --> 16:51.761
PROBABLY NOT THE ONLY FIRE
IN HIS CHILDHOOD.

16:51.810 --> 16:55.598
BEFORE HIS SON OF SAM
MURDERS, DAVID BERKOWITZ
SET A MULTITUDE OF FIRES.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.540
EXACTLY HOW MUCH
IS A MULTITUDE?

16:57.580 --> 17:00.174
ACCORDING TO HIS DIARY,
1,400 AND...

17:00.220 --> 17:01.141
88.

17:01.180 --> 17:03.341
LURING HIM OUT
WAS YOUR IDEA,
RIGHT

17:03.390 --> 17:06.541
ELLE. I DON'T SEND
A SWAT TEAM INTO A HOUSE
WITH CHILDREN.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.787
HOTCH SAYS YOUR BACKGROUND
IS IN SEX OFFENDER CASES.

17:09.820 --> 17:10.957
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

17:10.990 --> 17:13.823
THE LAST 4 MURDERS SHOW
HE'S AN ANGER-EXCITATION
RAPIST.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.158
HE'LL KEEP A VICTIM
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.725
HE PROBABLY RECORDS
OR VIDEOTAPES THEM

17:18.770 --> 17:20.362
SO THAT HE CAN KEEP
RELIVING THE FANTASY.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.459
YOU OK
WITH HOTCH BEING IN
ON THE INTERVIEW?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.502
I'D LIKE HIM TO LEAD,
ACTUALLY.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.360
FINE. BUT HOLD OFF.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.106
SLESSMAN'S DONE TIME,
AND HE KNOWS
THE PROCESS.

17:29.140 --> 17:32.200
AND ALL YOU WILL GET NOW
IS A DEMAND FOR A LAWYER.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.411
HOTCH,
LET'S CHECK THE GARAGE,

17:34.450 --> 17:36.077
THEN SHOW ME
WHAT YOU GOT.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.089
NEXT TIME,
SHOW A LITTLE LEG.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.510
MORGAN, THE ONLY TIME
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
A LITTLE LEG FROM ME

17:42.560 --> 17:44.585
IS WHEN I'M ABOUT
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.757
I STILL TEACH HAND-TO-HAND
OVER AT QUANTICO

17:46.790 --> 17:49.452
IF YOU NEED A LITTLE
BRUSH-UP TRAINING.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.421
SERIOUSLY...

17:50.470 --> 17:52.620
I WANT THAT OPENING
AT BAU.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.831
YOU GOT ANY ADVICE?

17:54.870 --> 17:57.805
JUST TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.875
WELL, WE GOT
THE JEEP RIGHT.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.673
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
WRONG.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.610
THE BODIES HAD
DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.

18:07.650 --> 18:10.778
RICHARD DOESN'T HAVE
A MARK ON HIM.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.450
WE'RE MISSIN'
SOMETHING.

18:26.470 --> 18:29.633
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT
ABOUT THIS.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.834
THIS IS A BOY'S ROOM...

18:33.880 --> 18:36.769
NOT A MAN'S.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.181
LOG IN PASSWORD.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.755
NO, NO--

18:52.790 --> 18:54.826
WAIT, WAIT!

18:55.960 --> 18:58.428
IT'S NOT TURNING
BACK ON.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.791
YEAH. AND IT WON'T.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.764
IT WAS A FALSE PASSWORD.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.413
WHAT KIND OF GAME IS IT?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.213
IN CHINA,
IT'S CALLED WEI-CHI.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.852
HERE WE CALL IT "GO".
IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE

19:22.890 --> 19:25.358
THE MOST DIFFICULT
BOARD GAME
EVER CONCEIVED.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.893
CHAIRMAN MAO
REQUIRED HIS GENERALS
TO LEARN IT.

19:27.930 --> 19:30.819
IT ALSO LOOKS LIKE
HE'S PLAYING HIMSELF.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.839
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

19:34.970 --> 19:37.803
THIS MIGHT PROVIDE
AN ADVANTAGE, ACTUALLY.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.807
GO IS CONSIDERED TO BE

19:38.840 --> 19:40.705
A PARTICULARLY
PSYCHOLOGICALLY
REVEALING GAME.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.332
THERE ARE PROFILES
FOR EVERY PLAYER--

19:42.380 --> 19:44.769
THE CONSERVATIVE
POINT COUNTER,
THE AGGRESSOR,

19:44.810 --> 19:45.504
THE FINESSER.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.815
WHAT KIND OF PLAYER
IS SLESSMAN?

19:50.020 --> 19:53.217
EXTREME AGGRESSOR.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.889
OK,
HERE WE GO.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.598
WHAT'S THE NUMBER 6
AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SCREEN?

20:02.630 --> 20:06.464
NUMBER OF PASSWORD ATTEMPTS
BEFORE THE PROGRAM
WIPES THE HARD DRIVE.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.799
THERE COULD BE
AN EMAIL OR A JOURNAL
IN THE COMPUTER,

20:09.840 --> 20:12.559
SOMETHING THAT TELLS US
WHERE HEATHER IS.

20:12.610 --> 20:15.807
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN BREAK IN?

20:15.840 --> 20:18.377
IN 6 TRIES?

20:18.650 --> 20:20.641
TRY AGAIN. FAIL AGAIN.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.944
FAIL BETTER.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.517
SAMUEL BECKETT.

20:26.290 --> 20:31.227
TRY NOT.
DO OR DO NOT.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.225
YODA.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.472
I WANNA TALK TO HIM.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.723
YOU READ MY PAPER.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.251
LEARN ANYTHING?

21:09.700 --> 21:11.861
HEIRENS
SAID A MAN LIVING
INSIDE OF HIS HEAD

21:11.900 --> 21:14.937
WAS THE ONE
WHO COMMITTED
THE MURDERS.

21:14.970 --> 21:15.766
YOU SAID HE WAS LYING,

21:15.800 --> 21:17.939
THAT THERE'D NEVER
BEEN AN ACTUAL CASE

21:17.970 --> 21:19.767
OF MULTIPLE
PERSONALITIES.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.506
YOU HAVE AN ACADEMIC
INTEREST

21:22.540 --> 21:24.849
IN DISASSOCIATIVE
IDENTITY DISORDER,

21:24.880 --> 21:27.075
OR YOU JUST PLANNING
YOUR DEFENSE?

21:34.920 --> 21:39.459
YOU A FAN
OF ADRIEN BAAL'S WORK?

21:39.890 --> 21:41.653
NO.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.628
I'M A FAN OF YOURS.

21:46.730 --> 21:48.459
YOU KNOW...

21:49.100 --> 21:52.900
THEY NEVER GIVE YOU
THE REAL FACTS
ABOUT CPR...

21:52.940 --> 21:58.776
THAT OUTSIDE OF A HOSPITAL,
IT'S ONLY EFFECTIVE
7% OF THE TIME.

21:58.810 --> 22:03.110
YOUR FRIEND HAD A 93%
CERTAINTY OF DYING,

22:03.150 --> 22:05.015
BUT YOU KEPT TRYING...

22:05.050 --> 22:07.985
EVEN AFTER
YOU'D BROKEN HIS RIBS,

22:08.020 --> 22:13.026
EVEN AFTER HIS BLOOD
WAS ALL OVER
YOUR HANDS.

22:15.930 --> 22:20.435
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHERE HEATHER WOODLAND IS?

22:28.840 --> 22:29.932
WOODLAND...

22:29.980 --> 22:33.973
ISN'T SHE THE GIRL
THAT WENT MISSING
A COUPLE DAYS AGO?

22:46.760 --> 22:49.524
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.885
HEY.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.052
HE IS "ISN'T SHE
THE GIRL..."

23:15.090 --> 23:18.025
IF HE'D ALREADY
KILLED HER,
HE WOULD HAVE SAID--

23:18.060 --> 23:19.459
"WASN'T SHE THE GIRL..."

23:19.490 --> 23:22.027
SHE'S ALIVE.
WE DON'T KNOW
FOR HOW LONG.

23:22.060 --> 23:26.099
IS IT TRUE WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT CPR? I MEAN,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.598
YOU WANT STATISTICS
ON CPR, ASK REID.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.801
I WANNA KNOW IF YOU'RE OK.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.660
I'M FINE.

23:32.710 --> 23:34.075
ARE YOU?

23:34.110 --> 23:36.499
THINK I CAN'T DO
THE JOB?

23:36.540 --> 23:40.818
I THINK YOU CAN'T BE
2 DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT ONCE.

23:48.090 --> 23:50.115
WHAT IS IT?

23:52.230 --> 23:55.495
CONFLICTS IN THE PROFILE.

23:59.130 --> 24:00.939
2 DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS.

24:00.970 --> 24:04.064
2 DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.759
THERE'S A SECOND KILLER.

24:12.710 --> 24:13.779
A SECOND UNSUB.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.673
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.914
REMEMBER LAWRENCE BITTAKER
AND ROY NORRIS?

24:15.950 --> 24:16.746
1979. THEY
OUTFITTED A VAN

24:16.780 --> 24:18.042
TO RAPE AND MURDER
GIRLS IN CALIFORNIA.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.911
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE WHO FITS
A SIMILAR RELATIONSHIP?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.053
THEY'RE NOT EQUALS.
SLESSMAN'S SMART,

24:23.090 --> 24:26.548
BUT HE IS
A SUBMISSIVE
PERSONALITY.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.558
SO NUMBER 2
IS THE DOMINANT.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.328
AUTHORITATIVE,
ARROGANT.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.520
PROBABLY NOT AS SMART
AS SLESSMAN.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.889
HE'S LIKE THE SCHOOLYARD
BULLY RECRUITING
A GOOD UNDERLING--

24:31.930 --> 24:36.094
HE'LL BE PROTECTIVE
OF RICHARD. HE'LL MAKE HIM
FEEL LIKE HE OWES HIM.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.505
IF RICHARD'S BEEN
UP IN THE ATTIC

24:37.540 --> 24:39.064
FANTASIZING ABOUT
BEING AN EXTREME
AGGRESSOR,

24:39.110 --> 24:40.259
THIS GUY SHOWED HIM
HOW TO DO IT.

24:40.310 --> 24:41.402
HE HELPED HIM
TAKE THE FIRST STEP.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.977
I THINK WE SHOULD
INTERVIEW HIM, USE
THIS AS PRESSURE.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.069
NO, NO.
WE NEED LEVERAGE.
A NAME.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.179
FROM THE SUSPECT
LIST?

24:47.210 --> 24:49.872
THAT'LL TAKE TOO LONG.
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A FASTER WAY.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.648
THERE IS.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.748
HERE. THIS MIGHT BE
A LITTLE HOT.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.658
MRS. SLESSMAN,
I DON'T THINK WE'VE
GOT THE RIGHT GUY.

24:55.690 --> 24:57.726
I THINK THE PERSON
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

24:57.760 --> 24:59.955
MIGHT BE A FRIEND
OF RICHARD'S.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.252
RICHARD NEVER HAD
MANY FRIENDS.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.224
YOU SURE?
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMEONE.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.828
YOU'VE REACH ED
PENELOPE GARCIA

25:06.870 --> 25:08.929
IN THE FBI'S OFFICE
OF SUPREME GENIUS.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.062
HEY, IT'S MORGAN.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.307
NEED YOU TO WORK ME
SOME MAGIC HERE.

25:12.340 --> 25:14.103
I GOT A PROGRAM
CALLED DEADBOLT DEFENSE

25:14.140 --> 25:17.849
AND A GIRL WITH ONLY
A COUPLE OF HOURS TO LIVE,
SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

25:17.880 --> 25:19.245
THEN YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.577
DEADBOLT'S THE NUMBER ONE
PASSWORD CRACK-RESISTANT
SOFTWARE OUT THERE.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.078
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET INSIDE THIS GUY'S HEAD
TO GET THE PASSWORD.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.941
I THOUGHT I WAS
CALLING THE OFFICE
OF SUPREME GENIUS.

25:26.990 --> 25:30.153
WELL, GORGEOUS,
YOU'VE BEEN REROUTED
TO THE OFFICE

25:30.190 --> 25:31.748
OF TOO FRIGGIN' BAD.

25:31.790 --> 25:32.757
THANKS ANYWAY.

25:32.790 --> 25:36.089
WELL, THERE WAS...
THERE WAS THIS ONE
YOUNG MAN.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.564
I THINK HIS NAME
WAS CHARLIE.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.138
CROSS-REFERENCE
CHARLIE FOR
THE SECOND UNSUB.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.202
CHARLIE IS PROBABLY
CHARLES LINDER.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.776
HE WAS SLESSMAN'S CELLMATE

25:48.810 --> 25:50.949
AND RECEIVED A DISHONORABLE
DISCHARGE FROM THE MILITARY.

25:50.980 --> 25:54.347
HE'S BIGGER, TOUGHER.
HE COULD HAVE PROTECTED
RICHARD IN PRISON.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.711
WHERE WERE THEY
INCARCERATED?

25:55.750 --> 25:58.241
CASCADIA.
LESS THAN A MILE
FROM HERE.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.178
LET'S GO.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.959
MY NAME IS RICHARD SLESSMAN,
AND I HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING.

26:03.990 --> 26:08.927
OK. WHAT DO I DO
WHEN I'M TRYING
TO GET TO SLEEP?

26:20.270 --> 26:21.931
GUYS, A LITTLE HELP.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.277
WE'RE GOING THROUGH
EVERY ONE OF THESE CDs--

26:23.310 --> 26:26.973
SCRATCHES, WEAR AND TEAR.
I WANNA KNOW WHICH CD
HE PLAYS THE MOST.

26:27.010 --> 26:28.773
LET'S GO.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.913
WE GET AN ADDRESS
ON LINDER?

26:30.950 --> 26:32.087
IT'S COMING RIGHT NOW.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.317
DOES SENIOR MANAGEMENT
WANT A FIELD ASSESSMENT
ON GIDEON?

26:35.360 --> 26:36.258
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.518
ARE THEY NERVOUS
ABOUT HIM BEING
IN CHARGE?

26:37.560 --> 26:41.291
AREN'T YOU ON YOUR WAY
BACK TO SLESSMAN'S HOUSE
TO HELP MORGAN?

26:41.330 --> 26:44.720
DO YOU KNOW WHY
HE ALWAYS INTRODUCES ME
AS DR. REID?

26:44.770 --> 26:47.398
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
THAT PEOPLE SEE YOU
AS A KID,

26:47.430 --> 26:50.661
AND HE WANTS TO
MAKE SURE THAT THEY
RESPECT YOU.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.734
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

26:51.770 --> 26:54.409
DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS ANYMORE.

26:58.980 --> 27:01.175
WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID,

27:01.220 --> 27:03.245
"THE FARTHER BACKWARD
YOU CAN LOOK,

27:03.280 --> 27:06.989
THE FARTHER FORWARD
YOU WILL SEE."

27:09.320 --> 27:12.153
ANYONE WHO CAN TELL US
MORE ABOUT SLESSMAN?

27:12.190 --> 27:15.250
TIM VOGEL
WAS THE SECURITY GUARD
COVERING SLESSMAN'S BLOCK.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.293
THAT'S HIM OVER THERE.
I'LL GET HIM FOR YOU.

27:20.070 --> 27:24.268
THAT WAS HOTCH.
LINDER'S NAME CAME UP
ON A POLICE REPORT.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.163
AND?

27:25.210 --> 27:26.404
HE'S DEAD.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.271
CAR ACCIDENT, 2 MONTHS AGO.

27:28.310 --> 27:31.802
LINDER IS DEAD.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.275
TOO BAD YOU GUYS
CAME HERE FOR NOTHING.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.412
I MEAN, TALK ABOUT SCUM.

27:38.450 --> 27:42.386
I CAN'T REMEMBER
HOW MANY TIMES I PUT
LINDER IN SOLITARY

27:42.420 --> 27:45.389
FOR CAUSING TROUBLE
WITH US.

27:46.390 --> 27:49.450
YOU'D THINK THE INMATES
WOULD TRY TO STAY ON
OUR GOOD SIDE, RIGHT?

27:49.500 --> 27:55.359
ESPECIALLY SINCE HALF
OUR JOB IS PROTECTING
THEM FROM EACH OTHER.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.361
YOU PROTECT THEM?

27:59.410 --> 28:01.878
IF YOU'RE A LITTLE
WHITE GUY?

28:01.910 --> 28:04.401
ESPECIALLY IN A PRISON
LIKE THIS.

28:04.450 --> 28:09.171
LINDER'S 6'4".
YOU TALKING ABOUT
SLESSMAN?

28:09.220 --> 28:11.415
OH, YEAH.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.880
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

28:17.190 --> 28:19.329
HE BEFRIENDED RICHARD,
PROTECTED HIM,

28:19.360 --> 28:21.328
MADE HIM FEEL LIKE
HE OWED HIM.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.397
HE FITS THE PROFILE.
AND DID YOU SEE THEM?

28:24.430 --> 28:26.193
THE KEYS.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.254
HOTCH, I JUST FOUND
YOUR LEVERAGE.

28:51.290 --> 28:55.351
HIS NAME
IS TIMOTHY VOGEL.

28:59.300 --> 29:00.324
WHAT'S HE DOING?

29:00.370 --> 29:01.564
LOWERING THE ROOM TEMP.
THE COLD PUTS THEM ON EDGE.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.262
OK, SO I WANT AN SPD,
AND I WANT A SEATTLE
AGENT IN THE ROOM.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.302
I WANT HIM TO SEE THAT
WE'VE GOT EVERY DEPARTMENT
WORKING ON THIS.

29:07.340 --> 29:08.898
AND I NEED
SOME FILE BOXES.

29:08.940 --> 29:12.046
FILL THEM. I DON'T CARE
IF THE PAPER'S BLANK.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.072
AND I WANT YOU TO WRITE
THE NAME ON THE SIDES.

29:15.120 --> 29:15.939
WHOSE NAME?

29:15.980 --> 29:17.914
4 MONTHS OF INVESTIGATIVE
WORK, 1 FILE,

29:17.950 --> 29:20.851
AND GUESS WHAT, RICHARD.
IT'S NOT YOUR FILE.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.859
SEE, WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.852
IT'S VOGEL WE WANT.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.270
I NEED A PASSWORD.
I NEED A PASSWORD.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.301
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

29:43.340 --> 29:46.207
WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY
BE LOOKING FOR?

29:46.250 --> 29:48.218
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THE CDs.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.070
OH, REID, COME ON.
WE TRIED THE CDS.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.042
WE SEARCHED, SIFTED,
AND SORTED THROUGH
EVERY ONE

29:52.090 --> 29:54.581
OF THIS GUY'S
HEAD-BANGING HEAW
METAL COLLECTION.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.214
WE GOTTA FIND SOMETHING,
OR THIS GIRL IS DEAD.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.024
THINK WE MAY HAVE
MISSED THE OBVIOUS.

30:00.630 --> 30:02.552
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:06.400 --> 30:08.834
REID, WHAT MADE YOU
THINK OF THIS?

30:08.870 --> 30:11.862
IT WAS THE ONLY
EMPTY CASE.

30:13.210 --> 30:16.134
ALL RIGHT. I'M AN INSOMNIAC
WHO LISTENS TO METALLICA

30:16.180 --> 30:17.909
TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.009
WHAT SONG COULD
POSSIBLY SPEAK TO ME?

30:20.050 --> 30:23.941
ENTER SANDMAN.

30:25.550 --> 30:28.951
WE FOUND OUT HEATHER
WAS BUYING A USED CAR.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.982
YOU KNOW
HOW CAR SALESMEN
GET US TO BUY A CAR?

30:32.030 --> 30:34.248
THEY CALL IT
RECIPROCITY.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.188
THEY DROP THE PRICE
AND...

30:36.230 --> 30:38.164
FEELS LIKE THEY'VE
DONE US A FAVOR.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.462
WE FEEL OBLIGATED.

30:39.500 --> 30:44.858
THERE'S A SUDDEN PRESSURE
TO RECIPROCATE THIS
ONE LITTLE FAVOR.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.138
AND IT'S SO POWERFUL
THAT WE'LL...

30:46.170 --> 30:50.630
PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN
ON A CAR WE'RE NOT
EVEN SURE WE REALLY WANT.

30:50.680 --> 30:51.544
SO WHAT?

30:51.580 --> 30:54.219
SO VOGEL DID YOU A FAVOR.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.343
HE PROTECTED YOU
IN PRISON,

30:56.380 --> 30:59.486
AND NOW YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU OWE HIM

30:59.520 --> 31:01.488
AND YOU NEED TO
PROTECT HIM.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.488
GUYS LIKE VOGEL
LEARN IN THE SCHOOLYARD

31:03.520 --> 31:06.023
WHICH KIDS TO BULLY
AND WHICH KIDS TO PROTECT,

31:06.060 --> 31:09.154
AND HE'S GOT YOU CONVINCED
THAT YOU OWE HIM SO MUCH

31:09.200 --> 31:12.294
THAT YOU'LL GO TO JAIL
FOR HIM.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.399
RICHARD...

31:15.440 --> 31:18.307
I'M HERE TO REMIND YOU
OF SOMETHING.

31:18.340 --> 31:21.537
YOU OWE HIM NOTHING.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.940
THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.277
WE GOTTA HIM
PULL OVER.
I CAN FEEL IT.

31:30.320 --> 31:34.211
YOU WANNA KNOW THE WORD
REPEATED MORE THAN ANY
OTHER IN YOUR FILE?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.353
IMPATIENT.

31:36.690 --> 31:40.456
YOU WANNA STOP HIM,
YOU GIVE ME A REASON.

31:40.490 --> 31:41.422
HIS BEHAVIOR.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.394
WHEN WE LEFT HIM,
HE WAS NERVOUS,
UNSETTLED.

31:43.430 --> 31:45.295
BUT NOW HE'S STOPPING
AT EVERY STOP SIGN.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.218
HE'S USING HIS BLINKER
AT EVERY TURN.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.033
HE'S SLOWING
AT YELLOW LIGHTS.

31:49.070 --> 31:53.336
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE
WHO IS RUSHING TO KILL
AND DUMP A BODY.

31:55.740 --> 31:58.277
OK. DO IT.

32:15.330 --> 32:19.619
FBI. PUT YOUR HANDS UP
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!

32:20.700 --> 32:24.033
PUT YOUR HANDS
THROUGH THE WINDOW NOW!

32:24.070 --> 32:25.935
NOW!

32:30.410 --> 32:34.210
ALL RIGHT, WITH YOUR
LEFT HAND I WANT YOU
TO OPEN THE CAR DOOR

32:34.250 --> 32:36.548
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

32:39.390 --> 32:40.482
GET OUT!

32:42.120 --> 32:43.314
IT'S NOT HIM!

32:43.360 --> 32:44.281
WHERE IS HE

32:44.330 --> 32:45.080
I DON'T KNOW!

32:45.130 --> 32:46.188
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'
DRIVING HIS CAR?!

32:46.230 --> 32:48.448
HE CAME UP TO ME
IN THE GARAGE AFTER
OUR SHIFT ENDED.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.592
HE ASKED IF HE COULD
BORROW MY TRUCK.

32:49.630 --> 32:51.723
WHAT KIND OF TRUCK?
HE'S DUMPING THE BODY.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.658
WHAT'S THE MAKE !

32:53.700 --> 32:55.190
DODGE! DODGE DAKOTA!

32:57.400 --> 32:59.402
GIDEON, HEATHER'S ALIVE.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.668
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

33:00.710 --> 33:04.373
'CAUSE WE'RE WATCHING HER
RIGHT NOW.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.356
HOTCH, HE'S GONNA
KILL HER.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.381
HE'S HEADING THERE NOW.
WE NEED A LOCATION.

33:17.420 --> 33:19.024
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TIME TO GET IT
OUT OF HIM.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.359
FIND SOMETHING, HOTCH,
OR THAT GIRL IS DEAD.

33:24.370 --> 33:29.535
MORGAN, CAN YOU SHOW ME
THE LAST 12 IMAGES
LINED UP NEXT TO EACH OTHER?

33:29.570 --> 33:31.606
YEAH.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.071
RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT THERE.

33:37.110 --> 33:39.670
YOU SEE THAT

33:39.710 --> 33:41.143
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

33:41.180 --> 33:43.171
IT'S SHIFTING POSITIONS

33:43.220 --> 33:44.778
LIKE IT'S SWAYING...

33:44.820 --> 33:47.118
LIKE THE EARTH
IS TILTING.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.084
NOT THE EARTH, DOC.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.348
THE OCEAN.

33:50.390 --> 33:51.482
SHE'S ON A BOAT

33:51.530 --> 33:53.828
IT'S A PIER OR A DOCK.
HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TRANSMIT

33:53.860 --> 33:56.420
THE WEBCAM IMAGE
FROM THE MIDDLE
OF THE OCEAN.

33:56.460 --> 33:57.449
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.092
IT'S THE BEST
WE GOT, HOTCH.
EVEN IF WE'RE RIGHT,

33:59.130 --> 34:01.564
GETTING THE EXACT
LOCATION'S ON YOU,
MY FRIEND.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.158
WHAT IS IT YOU ALWAYS
ASK GARCIA?

34:03.200 --> 34:07.261
TO WORK ME
A LITTLE MAGIC.

34:08.810 --> 34:10.402
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW...

34:10.440 --> 34:12.499
GIDEON'S TALKING
TO VOGEL...

34:12.550 --> 34:15.678
AND VOGEL'S NAILING YOU
TO THE WALL.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.211
YEAH, WHATEVER.

34:20.720 --> 34:25.180
HE SAID IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO KEEP THE GIRLS ON A BOAT.

34:28.160 --> 34:31.049
HE'S TALKING, RICHARD.

34:31.900 --> 34:34.164
RECIPROCITY.

34:34.570 --> 34:38.199
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS,
AND WE MAKE A DEAL.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.168
IS IT A DOCK?

34:43.210 --> 34:45.474
A PIER?

34:51.850 --> 34:54.410
IT'S A SHIPYARD.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.179
ALLIED SHIPYARD.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.257
REID, HE'S INSIDE.

35:35.630 --> 35:38.167
GET ELLE ON THE PHONE.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.688
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU NEED TO WAIT
FOR BACKUP.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.230
IF WE WAIT,
THE GIRL IS DEAD.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.158
AND IF WE HAD WAITED
IN BOSTON--

35:47.210 --> 35:47.938
I CAN'T.

35:47.970 --> 35:50.700
YOU TOLD ME
TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.218
AAH! STOP! STOP!

36:10.260 --> 36:11.864
STOP!

36:11.900 --> 36:13.265
STOP.

36:13.300 --> 36:14.597
GET BACK!
I'LL SHOOT HER.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.598
I WOULDN'T.
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D AIM THE GUN AT ME.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.608
YOU SHOOT THE GIRL,
YOU GOT NOTHING.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.959
GET. . .BACK!

36:21.010 --> 36:22.534
SHOOT ME INSTEAD.

36:22.580 --> 36:26.607
COME ON. WHAT,
ARE YOU A LOUSY
SHOT?

36:27.450 --> 36:30.840
50 FEET AWAY.
YOU GOT A PERFECT SHOT.
SHOOT ME.

36:30.880 --> 36:31.949
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

36:31.990 --> 36:33.946
I THINK YOU'RE
AN ABSOLUTE MORON.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.150
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YA,
TIM.

36:35.190 --> 36:38.284
YOU'RE AT THE GYM
5 TIMES A WEEK. YOU
DRIVE A FLASHY CAR,

36:38.330 --> 36:40.628
YOU STINK OF COLOGNE,
AND YOU CAN'T
GET IT UP.

36:40.660 --> 36:43.697
NOT EVEN VIAGRA'S
WORKIN' FOR YA. YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT TELLS ME?

36:43.730 --> 36:45.766
THAT TELLS ME YOU ARE
HOPELESSLY COMPENSATING,

36:45.800 --> 36:47.825
AND IT'S NOT JUST
IN YOUR HEAD.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.167
IT IS PHYSICAL.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.304
WHAT DID THE GIRLS
CALL YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL?
WHAT'D THEY COME UP WITH

36:51.340 --> 36:52.739
WHEN YOU FUMBLED
YOUR WAY INTO
SOME GIRL'S PANTS,

36:52.770 --> 36:54.271
AND SHE STARTED LAUGHING
WHEN SHE GOT A GOOD LOOK

36:54.310 --> 36:56.005
AT JUST HOW LITTLE
YOU HAD TO OFFER?

36:56.040 --> 36:57.769
SHUT UP!
SHORT STACK?

36:57.810 --> 37:00.973
VERY LITTLE VOGEL?
I GOT IT. TINY TIM.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.382
GIDEON!

37:08.020 --> 37:09.282
YOU OK?

37:09.320 --> 37:10.309
I'M FINE.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.249
GO LOOK AFTER THE GIRL.

37:29.310 --> 37:32.347
SO WHAT KIND OF REPORT
DO THEY WANT ON HIM?

37:32.380 --> 37:34.678
I SUPPOSE WHETHER
HE'S FIT TO BE
A FIELD AGENT.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.769
YOU KNOW, HALEY AND I
WERE LOOKING AT
A BABY NAMES BOOK.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.345
GUESS WHAT GIDEON
MEANS IN HEBREW.

37:40.390 --> 37:41.687
MIGHTY WARRIOR.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.450
APPROPRIATE.

37:45.590 --> 37:48.388
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL THEM?

37:48.430 --> 37:51.251
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.761
GIDEON
SAVED HER LIFE.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.258
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

38:27.570 --> 38:29.435
HEY.

38:31.570 --> 38:35.336
YOU AND HALEY PICK
THE BABY'S NAME YET?

38:35.680 --> 38:39.798
IT'S FUNNY...
HALEY LIKED THE NAME
CHARLES,

38:39.850 --> 38:43.377
BUT, YOU KNOW...
ALL I COULD THINK OF...

38:43.420 --> 38:44.910
MANSON.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.440
THEN THERE WAS HENRY.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.388
LEE LUCAS.

38:47.420 --> 38:48.682
UH...JEFFREY.

38:48.720 --> 38:49.379
DAHMER.

38:49.420 --> 38:52.423
THERE'S JUST
TOO MANY OF THEM.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.928
KIND OF HARD TO FEEL
GOOD ABOUT CATCHING ONE

38:55.960 --> 39:00.329
WHEN YOU KNOW THERE ARE
50 MORE STILL OUT THERE.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.401
HOW'S YOUR REPORT
GOING?

39:09.880 --> 39:11.905
DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD
HIDE THAT

39:11.950 --> 39:15.340
FROM AN OLD PROFILER,
NOW, DID YA?

39:16.680 --> 39:19.444
YOU KNOW,
YOU SAVED THAT GIRL
TODAY.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.880
YOU CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THAT.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.956
IT IS GOOD.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.983
IT'S A GOOD THING.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.434
NIETZSCHE ONCE SAID,

39:35.470 --> 39:38.439
"WHEN YOU LOOK LONG
INTO AN ABYSS,

39:38.470 --> 39:42.099
THE ABYSS LOOKS INTO YOU."

40:10.670 --> 40:13.503
I'LL TAKE THIS.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.556
HAVE A N-N-

40:32.590 --> 40:34.182
A N-N-N--

40:34.230 --> 40:36.619
NICE DAY.
