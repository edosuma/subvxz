00:00.673 --> 00:02.274
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:02.341 --> 00:04.676
<i>I just can't help but wonder</i>

00:04.744 --> 00:07.012
what I did to deserve
such an extravagant gift.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.581
Amy, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:09.649 --> 00:12.184
I told you, my dad wants me
to work with this horse,

00:12.252 --> 00:13.485
and so far,

00:13.552 --> 00:14.586
you've ignored everything
I've said.

00:14.654 --> 00:15.820
When Shane left
the last time

00:15.888 --> 00:17.789
he was convinced
that my dad and his mom

00:17.856 --> 00:19.056
have a thing
for each other,

00:19.124 --> 00:20.258
and then all of a sudden

00:20.325 --> 00:21.793
Shane and Miranda
just disappear?

00:21.860 --> 00:23.694
You still haven't
told your girls?

00:23.762 --> 00:26.130
I haven't told anyone,
except for you and Jack.

00:27.666 --> 00:29.200
Let me outta the truck,
Jack!

00:29.268 --> 00:32.101
Just think of it as
a friendly intervention,

00:32.170 --> 00:34.470
and an opportunity for you
to settle this Shane thing

00:34.538 --> 00:36.206
once and for all.

00:36.274 --> 00:37.607
If you let Tim
into your life,

00:37.675 --> 00:39.409
Shane won't just be
gaining a father,

00:39.476 --> 00:41.211
he'll be gaining
a whole family.

00:41.279 --> 00:44.347
I can't compete
with you guys.

01:01.965 --> 01:03.232
Oh my God,
that was so gross.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.265
I had to hold my breath

01:04.333 --> 01:06.067
the entire time
I was in there.

01:06.135 --> 01:07.101
Max, move.

01:07.169 --> 01:08.469
Can you give me
that pacifier?

01:08.537 --> 01:10.471
Mm-hm.
Sorry.

01:10.539 --> 01:11.772
I'll put him in the back.

01:11.841 --> 01:15.143
You know what? Forget it.
We gotta get going!

01:15.211 --> 01:17.145
<i>Honey, we have to hurry</i>

01:17.213 --> 01:18.880
so we can get home
before they do.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.447
What, am I driving
a getaway car?

01:20.514 --> 01:22.582
No, I just wanna
make a good impression.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.117
You made a good
impression already, honey.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.252
God. Look at me.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.586
I am so gonna have
to change.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.420
Honey, you
don't have to change.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.922
You look fine.

01:28.990 --> 01:29.923
<i>Maybe to you,
but to your mom?</i>

01:31.226 --> 01:32.692
Lou, I told you.
They're not like that, okay?

01:32.760 --> 01:33.861
And if you didn't want them
to come in the first place...

01:33.928 --> 01:35.295
Yeah.
Not invite your parents

01:35.363 --> 01:38.297
to their granddaughter's
baby naming ceremony?

01:38.365 --> 01:39.365
Can you hand me
that cell phone?

01:39.432 --> 01:41.267
I have to give everyone
our ETA.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.468
Oh... shoot!

01:43.370 --> 01:45.037
Max... sorry.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.242
Oh, yeah, dog drool.
Least of my worries.

02:01.820 --> 02:02.921
Yeah!

02:10.127 --> 02:11.695
What a good boy!

02:11.763 --> 02:13.931
He seemed to handle
that distance really well.

02:13.999 --> 02:16.233
You know, he'd ride all day
if I let him.

02:16.301 --> 02:17.534
So what do you say,

02:17.602 --> 02:18.335
should we try him out
of the gate a few times?

02:18.403 --> 02:19.870
Yeah, it's about time.

02:19.938 --> 02:21.872
Just as long as you give him
a couple of days off.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.107
All right?
He needs to recover.

02:23.174 --> 02:24.374
Right, right.
'Cause you know the saying?

02:24.441 --> 02:25.474
Slow and steady...

02:25.542 --> 02:27.676
Comes in dead last.

02:27.744 --> 02:30.246
He's a race horse, Tim.

02:31.348 --> 02:33.249
Who needs a day off...

02:33.317 --> 02:34.750
<i>'Cause he deserves it.</i>

02:36.787 --> 02:37.987
Well, I gotta run.

02:38.055 --> 02:38.988
Do you mind cooling him out
for me?

02:39.056 --> 02:40.355
Yeah. Sure, honey.
Thanks.

02:40.423 --> 02:41.323
<i>I'll see you later tonight.</i>

02:41.391 --> 02:42.391
<i>Okay, honey.</i>

02:42.458 --> 02:44.859
Lou's coming home today.

02:44.928 --> 02:46.028
Great.

02:46.095 --> 02:49.064
Give her a big hug
for me.

02:49.132 --> 02:51.366
That was Lou.
They'll be here soon.

02:51.434 --> 02:53.835
Did you know that
the you-know-who's are coming?

02:53.903 --> 02:55.270
Last minute thing.

02:55.338 --> 02:56.770
How'd she sound?

02:56.838 --> 02:59.540
She sounds like she could use
a week at the spa.

02:59.607 --> 03:01.608
And this Bartlett
naming ceremony

03:01.676 --> 03:03.911
seems to be giving her
just a little bit of stress.

03:03.979 --> 03:06.314
Not sure why.
Couldn't be much simpler.

03:06.381 --> 03:10.051
My great grandfather
built this fireplace

03:10.118 --> 03:13.119
using stone he found
right here on Heartland.

03:13.187 --> 03:14.754
And when there's
a new arrival,

03:14.822 --> 03:17.090
well, the fire gets lit

03:17.158 --> 03:19.259
and we give him
or her a name

03:19.327 --> 03:21.761
and a stone to go with it.

03:21.829 --> 03:23.396
That sounds lovely.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.698
Where's your stone?

03:25.766 --> 03:27.300
<i>This one right here.</i>

03:27.368 --> 03:29.268
<i>Uh-oh! Loose!</i>

03:30.203 --> 03:32.972
Oh, nothing a little mortar
won't fix.

03:33.039 --> 03:34.406
And while I'm at it...

03:34.474 --> 03:37.042
You know, I can't quite
remember the last time

03:37.110 --> 03:40.446
I had a good look
up inside here.

03:40.513 --> 03:42.247
<i>Oh...</i>

03:42.315 --> 03:44.449
Boy, that is filthy.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.517
But we're gonna call
a professional, right?

03:48.653 --> 03:49.887
What was I thinking?

03:54.793 --> 03:56.060
Lou!

03:56.128 --> 03:57.528
Lou! Peter! Hey!

03:58.763 --> 04:00.663
Amy, shhh!

04:00.731 --> 04:03.033
She fussed all the way
across Saskatchewan.

04:03.101 --> 04:04.368
And trust me,

04:04.435 --> 04:07.037
that drive could put
anyone into a coma.

04:07.105 --> 04:08.438
Lou! Good to see you!

04:10.574 --> 04:12.042
Sorry.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.343
Nevermind.

04:13.411 --> 04:15.778
Nobody ever died
from a lack of sleep.

04:15.846 --> 04:16.812
I should know.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.779
Can I hold her?
Can I take her?

04:17.846 --> 04:18.981
No, Mallory.

04:19.048 --> 04:20.382
She's cranky
when she wakes up.

04:20.450 --> 04:21.884
She's cranky?

04:21.951 --> 04:24.353
Listen.
The baby barfed on my jeans.

04:24.421 --> 04:25.821
I've just spent a month
with a woman

04:25.889 --> 04:27.789
who makes me feel like
the world's worst mother,

04:27.857 --> 04:29.325
and I don't even wanna know

04:29.393 --> 04:31.427
what this stain
on my shirt is.

04:31.495 --> 04:33.061
<i>Here they come!</i>

04:33.129 --> 04:34.095

04:41.770 --> 04:43.671

Oh, did you get my message
about the pies?

05:34.087 --> 05:35.253
I texted you
this morning.

05:35.321 --> 05:37.054
Well, yeah,
but I was at the track.

05:37.122 --> 05:38.722
<i>Lou?!</i>

05:38.790 --> 05:40.023
Where is she?

05:40.092 --> 05:43.427
Oh, where's my little
goddaughter!

05:44.362 --> 05:45.662
Now, see,
this is what drives me crazy.

05:45.730 --> 05:46.964
Because I phoned in
the order

05:47.031 --> 05:48.232
and all you had to do
was pick it up.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.633
Okay, okay,
I'm going.

05:49.701 --> 05:51.335
I'll get the pies.
Just don't worry about it.

05:51.403 --> 05:52.835
What? I can go
and grab something.

05:52.903 --> 05:53.970
Let me go
and get something.

05:54.037 --> 05:55.037
Or I can make a trifle.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.239
Peter's parents
are pie people.

05:56.307 --> 05:58.975
I need at least
two pie...

05:59.042 --> 06:00.276
Okay...
Pies.

06:00.344 --> 06:01.411
Okay, don't panic.

06:02.413 --> 06:04.314
<i>It's not as bad as it looks.</i>

06:07.218 --> 06:09.751
<i>And he swears it's going to be
ready by the naming ceremony.</i>

06:09.819 --> 06:12.221
Almost done!

06:12.288 --> 06:13.688
Home improvements or what?

06:13.756 --> 06:15.224
<i>Well...</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:18.127
Now I know how Santa Claus
must feel.

06:18.194 --> 06:19.461
I don't know how he does it.

06:19.529 --> 06:21.463
Welcome home, kids.

06:21.531 --> 06:24.365
Aw, and there's my girl.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.134
Oh, shoot, sorry.
You remember my folks?

06:26.201 --> 06:28.302
<i>Ah, Archie and Grace.</i>

06:28.370 --> 06:30.571
Lisa, and you remember Jack,
of course.

06:30.639 --> 06:33.307
Well, it's about time
you two showed up for a visit.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.408
On such
a wonderful occasion,

06:34.476 --> 06:36.477
we wouldn't have
missed it.

06:36.545 --> 06:37.945
Mm.
Such a charming home.

06:39.615 --> 06:41.615
So, Grampa,
what's going on here?

06:41.682 --> 06:43.250
Oh. A couple loose stones.

06:43.317 --> 06:44.817
Some bad mortar
in the chimney,

06:44.885 --> 06:45.952
and a good cleaning.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.220
So for the record,

06:47.288 --> 06:49.289
I did try to get him
to hire someone.

06:49.357 --> 06:50.624
Lisa...

06:50.691 --> 06:53.226
You know, Jack,
I'm pretty good with a trowel.

06:53.294 --> 06:55.061
Don't you even think
about it, Archie.

06:55.129 --> 06:56.162
You're a guest here.

06:56.229 --> 06:57.996
Listen,
you must be exhausted.

06:58.064 --> 06:59.465
Why don't we, uh...

06:59.533 --> 07:01.467
I'll take them down
to the dude ranch,

07:01.535 --> 07:04.069
- Yeah. - You follow me, we'll
get you settled in?

07:04.137 --> 07:06.172
Yeah, wait 'til you see
the fireplace in the cabin, Dad.

07:06.239 --> 07:07.506
<i>Real rundle stone dry stack.</i>

07:07.574 --> 07:09.341
Wow, Grampa! Huh!

07:09.409 --> 07:12.343
Perfect timing to launch
into a major project.

07:12.411 --> 07:14.312
Minor repair
is more like it.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.047
A little spit and Polish,

07:16.114 --> 07:17.515
and it'll be done
before you know it.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.217
Well, at least this'll
give the in-laws

07:19.285 --> 07:20.918
something to talk about.

07:20.986 --> 07:24.121
Not that they say much -
not to your face.

07:27.159 --> 07:30.026
Alanine, glycine, tryptophan,

07:30.094 --> 07:31.127
and...

07:33.864 --> 07:35.965
Serine glutamate.
Dammit!

07:40.438 --> 07:41.738
Hey, Scott.

07:44.874 --> 07:46.309
How's the studying going?

07:46.376 --> 07:47.943
Come on,
bio-chemistry?

07:48.011 --> 07:49.512
Yeah,
it's a no-brainer.

07:49.580 --> 07:50.580
Look, I was just
in the neighbourhood

07:50.647 --> 07:51.747
and I thought I'd come by

07:51.815 --> 07:53.048
and drop off
your pay cheque.

07:53.116 --> 07:55.418
Oh. Thank you.
Always welcome.

07:55.485 --> 07:57.019
Especially now
with the rent to cover.

07:57.087 --> 07:58.354
I hear you.

07:58.422 --> 08:01.089
Um, you up for
a momentary distraction?

08:01.156 --> 08:02.557
From hitting the books?
Always.

08:02.625 --> 08:03.825
What you got?

08:07.563 --> 08:09.698
Whoa!
Are you serious?

08:09.765 --> 08:12.467
Yeah. A 1970 triumph
Bonneville 650.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.602
Oh!

08:13.669 --> 08:15.870
This looks like a '71.
Yeah.

08:15.938 --> 08:17.605
Whatever it is,
it's seen better days.

08:17.672 --> 08:20.374
My cousin wants me to take it
to the repair shop in Calgary.

08:20.442 --> 08:22.809
He laid it over
and now it won't start.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.279
Well, why take it
all the way into the city?

08:25.347 --> 08:26.813
I can get it done.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.816
For sure, I can do it cheaper
than Calgary prices.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.418
I don't know.
What about your studying?

08:32.486 --> 08:33.653
It's like you said,

08:33.721 --> 08:35.221
bio-chemistry?
It's a no-brainer.

08:39.126 --> 08:40.126
So, I'll talk
to the gate crew,

08:40.193 --> 08:41.394
see when we can start
schooling.

08:41.462 --> 08:43.495
Well, we can wait
a few days, right?

08:43.563 --> 08:45.497
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's no rush.

08:45.565 --> 08:47.266
I mean, I've got a good
feeling about this horse.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.434
I'm glad you talked me
into the deal.

08:49.502 --> 08:52.137
Well, can I talk you
into buying me dinner?

08:52.204 --> 08:53.338
Uh, tonight?

08:54.274 --> 08:56.141
Oh, right,
you got that family thing.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.909
Yeah, I have a family thing.
Yeah.

08:57.977 --> 08:59.943
But why don't you come?

09:00.011 --> 09:01.579
To dinner at Heartland?

09:01.647 --> 09:04.148
Yeah. Yeah,
you can meet Lou's in-laws,

09:04.215 --> 09:05.616
and yeah, why not?

09:05.684 --> 09:08.586
Because the last family dinner
was a total catastrophe.

09:08.654 --> 09:10.288
No, an earthquake
is a catastrophe.

09:10.355 --> 09:11.789
I mean, the chicken
might be overdone,

09:11.856 --> 09:13.123
the peas might be mushy,

09:13.191 --> 09:14.957
but other than that
what could go wrong?

09:17.528 --> 09:19.095
Hey! Hey, Amy!

09:19.163 --> 09:20.897
Shane!
What're you doing here?

09:20.964 --> 09:22.999
Uh, me and my mom came in
for a piece of pie.

09:23.066 --> 09:24.401
Yeah, all the way
from Moose Jaw

09:24.468 --> 09:26.303
for some Saskatoon Berry pie.

09:26.370 --> 09:27.570
Well, I'm sorry,

09:27.638 --> 09:28.772
but I just grabbed
the last two.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.506
What're you really
doing here?

09:30.573 --> 09:33.509
Well, actually,
I had a couple of days off work,

09:33.576 --> 09:35.010
- So... - Yeah, so Mom
said we could visit.

09:35.077 --> 09:36.244
You know,
I get to see Pal,

09:36.313 --> 09:38.380
and we might even stay
at the dude ranch.

09:38.448 --> 09:40.382
Yeah, if there's room.

09:40.450 --> 09:42.618
I'm sure there is.

09:42.686 --> 09:44.520
Think you can save me
a piece of that pie?

09:44.587 --> 09:47.488
Tell you what,
I'll do better than that.

09:47.556 --> 09:49.324
How about you come
for dinner?

09:49.391 --> 09:51.025
Oh, I don't know...

09:51.092 --> 09:53.894
Come on, you haven't even
met Lou's baby.

09:53.962 --> 09:56.130
Yeah, come on, Mom.

09:57.433 --> 10:00.134
Yeah. Peter's dad basically
never said a word to me

10:00.202 --> 10:01.902
the entire time I was there,

10:01.970 --> 10:03.537
and his mother didn't
lift a finger

10:03.604 --> 10:05.238
to help me with the baby.

10:05.306 --> 10:07.307
It's like she figured
she raised six kids,

10:07.375 --> 10:09.509
so what's the big deal
with only one?

10:09.577 --> 10:11.110
<i>My mom had six kids,
right?</i>

10:11.178 --> 10:12.679
<i>So you can bet she knows
her way around babies,</i>

10:12.747 --> 10:14.481
and... sorry.

10:14.549 --> 10:17.050
She's got two daughters
and four daughters-in-law,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.651
so I bet she knows

10:18.719 --> 10:19.652
how to deal with them too,
you know?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.086
Yeah.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.356
She has no people
skills whatsoever.

10:23.423 --> 10:27.292
I felt like she was judging me
every minute of the day.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.095
That's unbelievable.
Peter's such a nice guy.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.131
Who knew he was the spawn
from in-laws from hell?

10:33.199 --> 10:34.833
I'm just glad
I'll get a chance

10:34.900 --> 10:36.100
to know your folks
a little better.

10:36.168 --> 10:36.835
They're good people.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.069
Yeah.

10:38.136 --> 10:39.537
Yeah, probably a little
more conservative

10:39.605 --> 10:41.706
than you're used to,
right?

10:41.774 --> 10:44.141
Especially when it comes
to things like...

10:44.209 --> 10:45.710
Naming a baby.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.480
Obviously Peter and I decided
on the first name together,

10:48.547 --> 10:51.181
and he knows that I want Marion
as the middle name,

10:51.249 --> 10:52.349
but he...

10:52.417 --> 10:56.086
No, she wants
his grandmother's name:

10:56.153 --> 10:57.488
Minnie.

10:57.555 --> 10:58.655
Minnie?

10:58.723 --> 11:01.057
Exactly. Who names
their kid Minnie?

11:01.125 --> 11:03.827
Well,
there's Minnie driver.

11:03.895 --> 11:05.996
Minnie Mouse.
Minnie Pearl.

11:06.063 --> 11:07.697
Minnie Me.

11:07.765 --> 11:09.532
Minnie Morris.

11:10.967 --> 11:13.302
Yeah.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.704
Lou thinks it sounds
like a car.

11:14.772 --> 11:15.805
Well,
that's 'cause it is.

11:15.873 --> 11:18.941
It's a classic
from a bygone era.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.376
Sorta like my folks,
right?

11:22.279 --> 11:24.646
You know, it's not that
they're close-minded, Jack.

11:24.714 --> 11:26.615
It's just...

11:26.682 --> 11:28.116
When it comes to things
like christenings,

11:28.183 --> 11:29.984
they're just used to things
a little more traditional.

11:30.052 --> 11:33.087
You know, like in a church,
with a minister.

11:33.155 --> 11:36.591
Mother Morris's
sole contribution.

11:37.493 --> 11:39.960
Peter wore it
at his christening.

11:40.028 --> 11:42.463
Well, at least
it's gender neutral.

11:43.698 --> 11:44.965
Sort of.

11:48.904 --> 11:51.305
<i>Oh... can you just, uh...</i>

11:51.372 --> 11:52.706
Grampa, get dressed.

11:52.774 --> 11:54.374
I will!

11:54.442 --> 11:55.475
Oh, hi!

11:57.177 --> 11:58.812
Something burning?

11:58.879 --> 12:00.613
No!

12:01.816 --> 12:03.450
Um, dinner will be
just a few minute.

12:03.517 --> 12:04.517
But why don't we go sit
in here,

12:04.585 --> 12:07.153
<i>get something to drink?</i>

12:08.055 --> 12:09.456
Hey! Jack.

12:09.523 --> 12:11.156
Hi, Tim.

12:11.223 --> 12:12.758
- Lou.
- Hi.

12:12.826 --> 12:13.792
Listen,
I hope you don't mind,

12:13.860 --> 12:15.694
<i>but I invited...</i>

12:15.762 --> 12:17.996
Janice. - Yeah.
Great.

12:18.064 --> 12:19.631
- Hey, Lou.
- Hi.

12:19.699 --> 12:21.366
Uh, congratulations.

12:21.434 --> 12:23.301
On the birth
of your baby.

12:23.369 --> 12:24.470
Oh, right. Yeah.

12:24.537 --> 12:25.804
That was, you know,
six months ago,

12:25.872 --> 12:28.172
but, hey,
who's counting, right?

12:28.239 --> 12:30.074
So, uh...

12:30.141 --> 12:31.342
What can we do to help?

12:31.409 --> 12:33.010
<i>Nothing, Dad. Nothing.</i>

12:33.078 --> 12:35.480
I'll just set an extra place.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.482
- Got the pies.
- Hey! Amy!

12:37.549 --> 12:40.451
And, uh, look who I picked up
at Maggie's.

12:40.519 --> 12:42.019
- Great!
- Hey!

12:42.954 --> 12:44.454
I hope we're not imposing.

12:44.522 --> 12:46.456
No. No. Not at all.

12:46.524 --> 12:48.057
<i>This is perfect timing.</i>

12:48.125 --> 12:51.495
I'll just set an extra...
Three places?

12:54.832 --> 12:55.932
Yeah, go on in.

12:59.769 --> 13:01.403
Your dad's gonna
teach me how to rope.

13:01.471 --> 13:02.872
Yeah?

13:03.773 --> 13:05.908
<i>I think you'd pick that up
pretty fast.</i>

13:05.976 --> 13:08.243
Yeah, I don't know.

13:15.150 --> 13:18.152
Thought a lot about
what Jack said.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.555
What? What?
You...

13:20.623 --> 13:21.756
Jack?
You talked to Jack?

13:21.824 --> 13:25.493
Yeah. And he made
a lot of sense.

13:25.561 --> 13:27.328
Why would you talk
to Jack?

13:27.396 --> 13:29.363
Oh, Tim, let it go.

13:29.431 --> 13:31.698
It doesn't matter.

13:31.766 --> 13:32.966
What does matter is that

13:33.034 --> 13:36.870
I need to do what's best
for my son.

13:36.938 --> 13:39.706
And if that means telling him
the truth about us,

13:39.774 --> 13:40.908
about you,

13:40.975 --> 13:44.511
then that's what's
gonna happen.

13:44.579 --> 13:46.246
Okay, so,
what do you wanna do?

13:46.313 --> 13:47.013
What's the next step?

13:47.080 --> 13:49.448
I don't know.

13:49.516 --> 13:52.117
I can't just drop a bomb
on him.

13:52.185 --> 13:53.218
No.

13:55.221 --> 13:58.558
Well, we could tell him
together.

14:01.394 --> 14:03.361
Yeah, we could do that.

14:03.429 --> 14:04.696
Okay, well then,
that's what we'll do,

14:04.764 --> 14:07.331
- tell him together.
- Okay.

14:09.569 --> 14:11.335
Okay, I've got this theory.

14:11.403 --> 14:13.271
First, I find out that
your dad came all the way

14:13.338 --> 14:15.106
to Moose Jaw
to see my mom.

14:15.174 --> 14:16.775
My dad was in Moose Jaw?

14:16.842 --> 14:19.142
And nobody just goes
to Moose Jaw.

14:19.210 --> 14:20.377
And all of a sudden,

14:20.445 --> 14:21.478
my mom decides
it's time to pick up

14:21.546 --> 14:23.647
and come back here.

14:23.715 --> 14:26.083
Okay.
So, what's your theory?

14:26.150 --> 14:28.285
Your dad's gonna ask my mom
to marry him.

14:28.352 --> 14:31.622
I'm almost a 100 percent sure
she's decided to say yes!

14:31.690 --> 14:33.156
Isn't that awesome?

14:33.959 --> 14:35.959
<i>It's, like, we're gonna be
a real family.</i>

14:36.026 --> 14:37.159
<i>Shane...</i>

14:38.562 --> 14:39.929
My dad has a girlfriend.

14:39.997 --> 14:42.331
Yeah, maybe,
but not for long.

14:43.266 --> 14:45.935
So, Jack, how
goes it with the mortar?

14:46.003 --> 14:47.303
Oh, good.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.672
Well, I found a few loose bricks
in the flue,

14:49.740 --> 14:51.339
but no big deal.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.508
If I were you, I'd
repoint the whole thing.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.043
Now don't go telling Jack
how to do things

14:55.111 --> 14:56.478
in his own home.

14:56.545 --> 14:57.646
Come on, Mom.
It's just dad's way of saying

14:57.714 --> 14:58.914
he wants to get his hands dirty,
right?

14:58.982 --> 15:01.282
Well, a man gets a couple
of days vacation,

15:01.350 --> 15:03.852
you'd think he'd rather
go fishing instead.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.453
<i>Well, you could twist his arm.</i>

15:07.122 --> 15:08.422
<i>Speaking of vacation,</i>

15:08.490 --> 15:10.024
how's your vacation going,
Shane?

15:10.926 --> 15:13.560
Well, we're not
really here on vacation,

15:13.629 --> 15:15.229
are we, Mom?

15:15.797 --> 15:19.066
I think he's gonna take you up
on those roping lessons, Dad.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.502
Oh yeah,
saw that coming.

15:21.569 --> 15:23.136
I don't think you came
all the way to Moose Jaw

15:23.203 --> 15:25.571
to give me roping lessons.

15:26.507 --> 15:28.574
You came to see my mom.

15:29.510 --> 15:31.210
You...
You told him?

15:31.278 --> 15:32.378
I didn't.

15:32.446 --> 15:33.379
I thought you
and I would...

15:33.447 --> 15:34.981
I didn't tell him.

15:35.049 --> 15:36.449
She didn't have to.
I figured it out myself,

15:36.517 --> 15:38.884
and Amy knows too.

15:38.952 --> 15:40.719
Well, I know what you told me,
Shane,

15:40.787 --> 15:42.788
but I don't believe it.

15:46.126 --> 15:48.927
Okay, but if it isn't true,
then why are we here?

15:48.995 --> 15:50.129
Hey, Shane,
you've said enough.

15:50.196 --> 15:52.731
No, no, obviously,
he knows.

15:52.799 --> 15:53.866
Knows what, Dad?

15:56.068 --> 15:59.804
But right now is really not
the time or the place.

15:59.872 --> 16:02.040
I think that you and I
and our son

16:02.107 --> 16:03.775
should take a walk.

16:06.278 --> 16:08.612
<i>What?! Your son?</i>

16:09.682 --> 16:12.816
- Who said...
- Oh my God, Dad!

16:20.424 --> 16:21.357
Wait.

16:21.425 --> 16:22.492
Sh-Shane...

16:22.560 --> 16:24.327
Shane!

16:24.395 --> 16:25.829
Thank you for this.

16:25.897 --> 16:26.996
No, no,
I will handle this.

16:27.064 --> 16:29.598
No. No!
I'm gonna talk to my son.

16:29.666 --> 16:30.733
Not you.

16:33.303 --> 16:34.503
This is...
this is unbelievable.

16:34.571 --> 16:35.637
I...

17:05.779 --> 17:07.112
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:07.848 --> 17:09.582
- Check this out.
- Ty...

17:09.650 --> 17:11.150
This is an original sparkplug

17:11.217 --> 17:13.218
from the 1971 Triumph
bBonneville.

17:13.286 --> 17:15.320
Ty...

17:15.387 --> 17:17.690
What? What's wrong?

17:17.758 --> 17:19.892
Shane's my brother.

17:21.026 --> 17:22.560
What?

17:22.627 --> 17:24.496
He's my dad's son.

17:25.431 --> 17:27.732
You're kidding me.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.902
No. It's true.

17:30.970 --> 17:33.538
Wow!
You have a brother.

17:35.675 --> 17:39.042
You're right,
there was something going on.

17:39.110 --> 17:40.277
You should've seen
Shane's face

17:40.345 --> 17:41.278
when he found out.

17:41.346 --> 17:43.481
He was totally shocked.

17:44.415 --> 17:46.049
Well, what about you?

17:46.117 --> 17:49.653
You must've been
pretty shocked too, right?

17:49.721 --> 17:51.956
I don't know.
I'm...

17:53.491 --> 17:55.892
I'm pretty okay with it.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.728
<i>Oh my God!
I have a brother.</i>

17:58.796 --> 18:00.296
I have a brother.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.867
How long do you think my dad
has known about this?

18:03.934 --> 18:05.267
Do you think he knew

18:05.335 --> 18:06.569
the first time
they came to the dude ranch?

18:06.637 --> 18:08.204
I don't know, honey,
you'd have to ask him.

18:08.271 --> 18:09.705
Like what is wrong
with him?

18:09.772 --> 18:10.939
He has a secret love child

18:11.007 --> 18:13.842
and he waits until now
to reveal all.

18:13.910 --> 18:15.143
Oh my God...

18:15.211 --> 18:16.512
Your parents.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.846
What they must be thinking.

18:17.914 --> 18:19.815
Oh, they'll be fine.

18:19.883 --> 18:20.949
Come here.

18:21.951 --> 18:23.018
Come here.

18:26.321 --> 18:27.321
It's gonna be fine.

18:27.389 --> 18:28.523
It's just...

18:28.590 --> 18:31.792
This was supposed to be
about our baby.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.894
I am a terrible person.

18:32.961 --> 18:34.061
I can't believe
I just said that!

18:34.129 --> 18:35.830
You're not a terrible person,
Lou.

18:35.898 --> 18:37.798
And as far as my parents go,

18:37.866 --> 18:39.901
just don't worry
about them, okay?

18:39.968 --> 18:43.302
They understand that things
happen in families.

18:43.370 --> 18:46.640
Yeah, in other families.

18:56.283 --> 18:58.517
Shane, I...

18:58.585 --> 19:01.119
I know you're mad at me,

19:01.187 --> 19:04.156
and you have
every right to be.

19:05.091 --> 19:10.328
Look, I'm the one who decided
not to tell him about you.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.197
I wanted...

19:15.100 --> 19:19.003
I was determined
to raise you on my own.

19:22.140 --> 19:24.141
You were my baby.

19:26.278 --> 19:28.012
You still are.

19:31.115 --> 19:34.184
You are so,
so precious to me.

19:40.524 --> 19:42.459
Please,

19:42.526 --> 19:44.860
please say something.

19:49.332 --> 19:51.133
You lied to me.

20:00.643 --> 20:01.977
<i>Dad, how could you do this?</i>

20:02.044 --> 20:03.511
I'm not proud of that time
in my life, okay?

20:03.579 --> 20:04.846
If I had had a clue--

20:04.914 --> 20:06.948
Oh please, you've known
about this for months

20:07.016 --> 20:08.617
and you never said
a word to us.

20:08.684 --> 20:09.918
Yeah, Shane kept telling me
there was something going on.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.052
Have you talked to him?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.654
No, not yet I haven't. No.

20:12.722 --> 20:14.222
Well, maybe you should.

20:14.289 --> 20:15.389
He thought that you and his mom
were getting married.

20:15.457 --> 20:16.690
Oh please!

20:16.758 --> 20:17.958
I-I will...
I'm going to talk to him

20:18.026 --> 20:19.927
as soon as his mother
lets me near him.

20:19.995 --> 20:21.095
Come on, Dad.

20:21.162 --> 20:23.396
What?
I'm not making excuses.

20:23.464 --> 20:26.100
For that time in my life,
I made some bad choices.

20:26.167 --> 20:27.735
It was a lot to process.

20:27.802 --> 20:30.037
You know, your grandfather
could tell you.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.705
Wait, you knew about this,
Grampa?

20:31.773 --> 20:33.006
<i>Jack.</i>

20:33.073 --> 20:34.107
<i>And you never told anyone?</i>

20:34.174 --> 20:35.474
Jack?

20:35.542 --> 20:37.043
It wasn't my place to tell.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.011
And you knew
about this too!

20:38.078 --> 20:39.311
Well, not really.

20:39.379 --> 20:40.579
I mean,
I suspected something.

20:40.648 --> 20:42.281
You suspected,
but you didn't say anything?

20:42.349 --> 20:43.850
I mean, somebody could've
had the decency

20:43.917 --> 20:44.917
to fill me in here.

20:44.985 --> 20:46.152
Lou,
you were out of town.

20:46.219 --> 20:48.655
Well, there's telephones,
e-mail, text messaging.

20:48.722 --> 20:50.756
<i>I mean, have you guys never
heard of social networking?</i>

20:50.823 --> 20:52.191
I mean, why was I
hehe last one to know?

20:52.259 --> 20:53.859
Okay, whoa. I get that
this thing with Shane

20:53.926 --> 20:55.127
couldn't have happened
at a worse time,

20:55.195 --> 20:56.395
<i>but it happened,</i>

20:56.463 --> 20:57.329
and you've gotta
get over yourself!

20:57.397 --> 20:58.631
Get over myself?

20:58.698 --> 20:59.931
Lou, you are being
so self-centered.

20:59.999 --> 21:01.767
- Come on, girls!
- Okay, I'm sorry,

21:01.834 --> 21:03.469
but there's a lot going on
in my life right now

21:03.537 --> 21:05.203
so excuse me
if it's taking me a while

21:05.271 --> 21:06.737
to get used to the idea.

21:06.805 --> 21:08.239
What idea?

21:20.719 --> 21:21.851
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

21:21.919 --> 21:23.453
I mean,
who are these people?

21:23.521 --> 21:25.556
<i>I don't even know
who my own family is anymore.</i>

21:25.623 --> 21:27.391
Let's just get in the car
and go back to Estevan

21:27.458 --> 21:28.925
for a proper christening.

21:28.993 --> 21:30.360
No. H-honey...
Lou, seriously...

21:30.428 --> 21:31.928
<i>No, I am serious.</i>

21:31.996 --> 21:33.263
<i>Maybe your family
can get their act together,</i>

21:33.331 --> 21:34.964
because mine obviously can't.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.099
Lou...

21:36.167 --> 21:37.600
I don't care
if the baby has to wear

21:37.668 --> 21:38.767
an ancient christening dress

21:38.835 --> 21:39.902
and walk around
the rest of her life

21:39.969 --> 21:41.604
with an archaic name
like Minnie.

21:41.672 --> 21:42.938
And you know what?
By the way,

21:43.006 --> 21:44.507
there are at least
12 Morris grandchildren.

21:44.575 --> 21:45.908
But only my daughter
gets stuck

21:45.975 --> 21:48.477
with a ridiculous name.
Honey, honey...

21:48.545 --> 21:49.612
Hi, guys.

21:51.114 --> 21:52.181
Yeah.

21:54.550 --> 21:55.617
Hi.

22:14.869 --> 22:17.070
Janice. Hi.

22:17.138 --> 22:19.373
I think we need to talk.

22:19.441 --> 22:22.075
Look, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way,

22:22.143 --> 22:24.010
but Tim and me...

22:24.078 --> 22:27.447
It hasn't exactly been
the smoothest ride.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.349
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

22:29.416 --> 22:33.052
Look, I have real feelings
for him,

22:33.120 --> 22:37.390
but if there's something
going on between you and Tim,

22:37.458 --> 22:40.293
I don't really wanna
stand in the way.

22:40.361 --> 22:42.694
I don't want to be
in competition with you

22:42.762 --> 22:44.363
because I would lose.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.364
I mean, you guys have
a kid together

22:45.431 --> 22:46.998
and I just...

22:47.066 --> 22:49.200
I know there's a lot
of history there,

22:49.269 --> 22:52.671
so...

22:52.739 --> 22:54.773
Ancient history,

22:54.840 --> 22:57.375
<i>so you don't have
to worry.</i>

22:57.442 --> 23:00.745
There's nothing going on
between Tim and I.

23:00.812 --> 23:03.147
It's all about Shane.

23:16.694 --> 23:19.128
What're you doing here?

23:19.196 --> 23:20.897
Uh... I, um...

23:20.964 --> 23:23.366
I just had a few things
I had to clear up with Miranda.

23:24.535 --> 23:26.336
What?

23:26.404 --> 23:30.005
Wait a second.
Whoa, wait. Hold it!

23:30.072 --> 23:32.741
Come on!
You don't think that...

23:32.809 --> 23:34.009
I had to hear it
from her, Tim.

23:34.076 --> 23:35.544
Because if there is
something going on,

23:35.612 --> 23:37.446
I don't wanna be
the last person to know.

23:37.514 --> 23:40.148
There's nothing's going on
with me and anyone.

23:40.216 --> 23:42.217
Except maybe with you.

23:42.285 --> 23:45.687
I wanna believe you, Tim.
I just...

23:45.754 --> 23:47.188
No, believe me.

23:48.123 --> 23:49.190
Believe me.

24:06.974 --> 24:08.775
Believe me now?

24:10.277 --> 24:11.545
Okay.

24:11.612 --> 24:13.613
That was a pretty
persuasive argument.

24:13.681 --> 24:15.515
I gotta talk to Shane.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.083
His mom says
he's feeding the horses.

24:19.353 --> 24:21.186
Shane! Wait. Wait, Shane!

24:21.254 --> 24:23.155
Get up, get up!

24:32.455 --> 24:33.589
<i>I looked through your pantry</i>

24:33.656 --> 24:35.824
but I couldn't find
the hot mustard.

24:35.892 --> 24:39.227
<i>Archie only likes hot mustard
on his sandwich.</i>

24:39.295 --> 24:41.096
Oh. Uh... okay.

24:42.031 --> 24:43.732
I'll go into town
and pick some up.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.968
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He'll, he'll survive.

24:47.035 --> 24:48.102
Okay.

24:50.472 --> 24:52.473
Grace, you know, um...

24:52.540 --> 24:53.941
I guess nothing
about this weekend

24:54.009 --> 24:57.044
has really turned out
the way we all planned.

24:57.112 --> 24:59.714
My only plan was to get
to know your family better,

24:59.781 --> 25:02.082
and believe me,
I haven't been disappointed.

25:02.149 --> 25:04.117
Yeah,
never a dull moment.

25:04.184 --> 25:05.518
But, um...

25:05.586 --> 25:06.720
You know, with the way
it's all turned out,

25:06.787 --> 25:08.254
I just don't think
this naming ceremony

25:08.322 --> 25:11.091
is in the cards,
so...

25:11.158 --> 25:12.859
Look, Lou,

25:12.927 --> 25:14.460
you don't have to call
the baby Minnie,

25:14.528 --> 25:15.528
if you don't want to.

25:15.596 --> 25:17.796
Oh, Grace,
I was just...

25:17.864 --> 25:19.331
Nevermind.

25:19.398 --> 25:21.767
It was just something
I mentioned in passing to Peter.

25:21.835 --> 25:25.270
<i>Now, can we not over-think
every little detail?</i>

25:26.539 --> 25:27.539
Hey, Lou.

25:27.607 --> 25:29.441
Hi.

25:29.509 --> 25:30.609
Hi...

25:30.677 --> 25:32.277
- Grace.
- Hi, Grace.

25:32.345 --> 25:33.511
Hello.

25:33.578 --> 25:35.546
So, have you seen Shane?
I... we're...

25:35.614 --> 25:37.481
What? No. Not lately.

25:37.549 --> 25:39.416
Well, thanks.

25:39.484 --> 25:40.518
This is your fault.

25:40.585 --> 25:42.086
Let's just go, okay?

25:42.154 --> 25:43.287
<i>It's not like the first time
he's ever run away.</i>

25:43.355 --> 25:44.388
<i>You've gotta be used to it
by now.</i>

25:46.591 --> 25:48.126
Because of the heat cycles,

25:48.193 --> 25:50.493
you have to expect
a little loose mortar

25:50.561 --> 25:52.062
between the bricks.

25:52.130 --> 25:53.864
<i>Yeah, I get that.</i>

25:53.931 --> 25:56.166
You have to repoint with mortar

25:56.233 --> 25:58.869
of the same thermal expansion
coefficiency

25:58.936 --> 26:00.503
as the brick you repaired.

26:00.571 --> 26:02.338
See,
now I don't get that.

26:02.406 --> 26:03.907
Well then,
let me help you.

26:03.975 --> 26:05.340
<i>Because if we don't do it,
it won't get done.</i>

26:05.408 --> 26:07.143
At least not before
the christening...

26:07.210 --> 26:11.080
Or as you folks call it,
the, uh, "naming ceremony."

26:11.148 --> 26:14.583
Okay then, Archie,
let's get at it.

26:27.763 --> 26:29.564
<i>Well, look who I found
out on the trail.</i>

26:35.370 --> 26:37.037
<i>It's a cool bike.</i>

26:37.105 --> 26:38.538
Are you gonna ride it?

26:39.473 --> 26:43.010
Well, I gotta get
it to start first.

26:43.078 --> 26:45.112
How do you do that?

26:45.180 --> 26:47.380
Well, you gotta make sure
there's gas in the tank,

26:47.448 --> 26:48.749
and then a charge
in the battery,

26:48.817 --> 26:50.818
and then just kind of
troubleshoot your way

26:50.885 --> 26:52.152
from there.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.419
You wanna toss me
that rag?

26:53.486 --> 26:54.921
Yeah, sure.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.055
<i>Thanks.</i>

26:58.959 --> 27:00.326
It's my dad.

27:00.393 --> 27:01.460
Great.

27:02.429 --> 27:03.896
Hello!

27:03.964 --> 27:06.599
Yeah,
I'm looking right at him.

27:07.534 --> 27:09.000
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

27:09.068 --> 27:10.468
Yeah.

27:11.604 --> 27:13.705
He's with your mom.
I guess she's pretty upset.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.208
Yeah, she's upset.

27:16.275 --> 27:18.243
Well, you did run off, Shane.

27:18.310 --> 27:19.911
Yeah, well,
I had my reasons.

27:19.979 --> 27:21.579
Such as?

27:21.647 --> 27:22.647
You were right.

27:22.715 --> 27:24.982
Your dad does have
a girlfriend.

27:25.050 --> 27:28.485
I was stupid to think
he was gonna marry my mom.

27:28.553 --> 27:29.854
<i>Hey.</i>

27:29.921 --> 27:31.255
My dad may have
a girlfriend,

27:31.322 --> 27:34.125
but he's still your father.

27:35.827 --> 27:39.496
I guess I just wanted us
to be a family.

27:39.564 --> 27:41.131
<i>Just because your parents
aren't together, Shane,</i>

27:41.198 --> 27:42.966
doesn't mean you're not
a family.

27:43.033 --> 27:44.267
It's true.

27:44.334 --> 27:45.701
I mean, you've got a mom
and a dad,

27:45.770 --> 27:46.903
and you're their son.

27:46.971 --> 27:49.639
Yeah,
but not a real son.

27:52.943 --> 27:55.278
I wish I'd never met him.

27:56.247 --> 27:59.114
Well,
we should head back.

27:59.182 --> 28:00.249
Come on.

28:02.051 --> 28:02.918
See ya, Shane.

28:02.986 --> 28:04.653
<i>See ya.</i>

28:07.690 --> 28:09.758
- There she is.
- Shhh!

28:12.828 --> 28:15.462
So, it's official.
Your mom can't stand me.

28:15.530 --> 28:16.864
No, that's not true.

28:16.932 --> 28:17.865
Oh, it is true.

28:17.933 --> 28:19.633
No, it isn't.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.170
It's gonna be fine.

28:22.237 --> 28:24.772
We're gonna name the baby
just like we said we would.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.773
It's all gonna work out.

28:25.841 --> 28:27.208
Are we though?

28:27.276 --> 28:29.042
Because we said wanted
a small family thing,

28:29.110 --> 28:30.277
and now look at it.

28:30.344 --> 28:32.078
You know,
I don't know Miranda.

28:32.146 --> 28:34.380
I barely know Shane.

28:34.448 --> 28:35.849
Yeah, he probably feels
just the way I felt

28:35.917 --> 28:37.417
when we first started dating.

28:37.484 --> 28:39.319
What're you
talking about?

28:39.386 --> 28:41.721
Nothing, honey.
It's just that...

28:41.789 --> 28:42.956
I know how it feels
to be an outsider

28:43.024 --> 28:44.191
in your family,
okay?

28:44.258 --> 28:45.657
Okay, it is hardly
the same thing.

28:45.725 --> 28:46.859
Oh really?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.094
You remember
when we first got together

28:49.162 --> 28:51.463
and you had to keep me
under wraps all the time?

28:51.531 --> 28:53.332
Huh? Remember?

28:53.399 --> 28:55.600
You physically hid me
from Jack, Lou.

28:55.668 --> 28:58.971
- Okay. - I was the enemy.
The evil oil guy.

28:59.039 --> 29:00.372
Yeah,
and that didn't last.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.439
Yeah, you're right,
it didn't.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.907
And you know why?

29:02.975 --> 29:05.543
Because you made sure
of it.

29:05.610 --> 29:08.179
You just dragged me along
for the ride.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.547
Now look at us.

29:09.614 --> 29:10.681
Look at how far
we've come.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.986
Shoot, even my damn dog's
a part of the family now!

29:15.921 --> 29:16.987
Huh?

29:22.626 --> 29:24.694
<i>All right, let's do it.
Let's talk to him.</i>

29:24.762 --> 29:26.230
Wait.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.664
I wanna talk to our son.

29:27.732 --> 29:28.866
I don't know.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.334
On my own.

29:54.656 --> 29:55.891
Your mother
was pretty disappointed

29:55.958 --> 29:59.227
I jumped the gun at dinner
last night.

30:00.162 --> 30:05.165
We were supposed
to tell you together.

30:06.268 --> 30:07.567
Probably not the first time

30:07.635 --> 30:09.937
I haven't made good
on a promise to her.

30:13.241 --> 30:15.075
I feel lucky that she gave me
a second chance

30:15.143 --> 30:16.911
to get to know you.

30:19.247 --> 30:22.382
Actually, she gave me
a third chance.

30:26.954 --> 30:28.187
I was kinda hoping
that you might give me

30:28.255 --> 30:29.455
another chance too,
son.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.158
Son?

30:32.226 --> 30:33.927
Gimme a break.

30:33.994 --> 30:35.461
Hey, wait a second.
We're still talking.

30:35.529 --> 30:36.896
Don't walk away from me.

30:36.963 --> 30:40.532
Yeah, well, you
walked away from me.

30:43.937 --> 30:46.638
She's really so adorable.

30:46.705 --> 30:48.373
Yeah, she is.

30:54.512 --> 30:56.847
Look, I'm really sorry
about what I said.

30:56.915 --> 30:58.382
Don't worry about it.

30:58.450 --> 31:01.584
I'm working on
getting over myself.

31:02.519 --> 31:03.753
I just...

31:03.821 --> 31:06.156
I know this is a lot
to take in

31:06.223 --> 31:07.757
and...

31:07.825 --> 31:10.160
I know how much
this ceremony means to you.

31:10.227 --> 31:11.294
Typical Dad.

31:11.362 --> 31:14.564
Picked the perfect time,
as usual.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.167
Lou, Shane...
Shane is a great kid.

31:18.234 --> 31:20.169
I think you'd really like him
if you gave him a chance.

31:20.236 --> 31:22.071
It's not about that.

31:22.138 --> 31:23.439
He seems like
a really great kid.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.940
It's...

31:25.008 --> 31:27.642
Just hasn't really sunk in yet,
you know?

31:27.710 --> 31:29.778
We have a brother.

31:30.981 --> 31:32.513
I know.

31:33.748 --> 31:36.250
You know, it's pretty amazing
when you think about it.

31:36.318 --> 31:37.785
Do you remember
when we were little

31:37.853 --> 31:39.787
and we always wished
that we had a little brother

31:39.855 --> 31:41.189
that we could boss around

31:41.256 --> 31:43.557
and do the dishes
after dinner.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.460
Blame him for everything
that went wrong.

31:45.527 --> 31:47.195
Exactly, yeah.

31:47.262 --> 31:48.928
You have a brother?

31:50.631 --> 31:53.867
Shane is your brother?
Are you kidding me?

31:57.150 --> 31:58.117
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

31:58.185 --> 31:59.985
Mallory, you can pull the plug
on the sandwiches.

32:00.053 --> 32:01.754
You've got enough there
to feed an army.

32:01.822 --> 32:03.222
Well, boys are big eaters.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.324
A growing boy
in a growing family,

32:05.391 --> 32:06.458
believe me,

32:06.526 --> 32:07.926
the grocery bill
is gonna skyrocket.

32:07.993 --> 32:09.328
I don't know about that.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.795
You know he lives in
a different province

32:10.863 --> 32:11.796
with his mom.

32:11.864 --> 32:13.298
You just you wait.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.633
I remember
when I was his age.

32:14.701 --> 32:16.702
I practically lived here.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.303
Yeah. It's like you've always
been a part of the family.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.106
Yeah, but he is family,
and blood is thick--

32:22.173 --> 32:23.874
thicker than friends
or neighbours,

32:23.942 --> 32:26.009
or not to mention
a loyal employee

32:26.077 --> 32:27.010
for years and years.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.512
Mallory...

32:28.580 --> 32:30.348
Don't worry,
this'll be the last sandwich

32:30.415 --> 32:32.883
I'll be making
at this house.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.885
I see. Okay.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.488
<i>Are you my little
sweetheart girl?</i>

32:38.556 --> 32:40.056
<i>Yes you are.</i>

32:40.124 --> 32:43.260
<i>Yes you are.
I see you're my girl.</i>

32:43.327 --> 32:44.127
Yes I do.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.831
<i>There.
That's my girl.</i>

32:49.800 --> 32:50.867
Grace?

32:52.269 --> 32:55.003
Oh.
I, I was just, um...

32:55.071 --> 32:58.140
I didn't want her
to get a chill.

32:59.075 --> 33:01.042
<i>It's the cutest baby
I've ever seen.</i>

33:01.110 --> 33:02.511
I just love her to bits.

33:02.579 --> 33:04.346
Me too.

33:04.847 --> 33:07.983
<i>Look at that.
She's got the Morris mouth.</i>

33:08.050 --> 33:11.019
And that determined little look
she gets on her face

33:11.087 --> 33:12.788
reminds me of someone.

33:12.855 --> 33:13.989
Your mom?

33:14.056 --> 33:15.123
No, you.

33:18.060 --> 33:21.696
Grace, uh,
I have a big favour to ask.

33:21.764 --> 33:23.531
There's something
I really need to take care of

33:23.599 --> 33:25.266
and I was hoping maybe
you could watch her

33:25.333 --> 33:26.300
for a little while?

33:26.367 --> 33:28.468
Oh, I'd love to!

33:28.536 --> 33:31.238
I've been dying
to get my hands on that baby.

33:31.306 --> 33:32.239
You have?

33:32.307 --> 33:33.573
Of course!

33:33.641 --> 33:35.976
Okay, Grace,
if that's true,

33:36.044 --> 33:37.812
why did you never
say anything?

33:37.879 --> 33:39.246
Lou,

33:40.114 --> 33:43.817
the last thing a new mom needs
is unwanted advice.

33:43.884 --> 33:47.153
When my kids were little,
Archie's mom was insufferable.

33:47.221 --> 33:49.722
I couldn't do anything right.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.825
And right there and then
I decided

33:51.892 --> 33:57.262
that I was not gonna be one
of those pushy mother-in-laws,

33:57.330 --> 34:00.365
and that when I became
a grandmother,

34:00.433 --> 34:05.170
I would never offer an opinion
unless it was asked.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.141
And I was beginning to think
you would never ask.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.712
Oh...

34:20.351 --> 34:22.320
Look, I'm sorry.

34:22.387 --> 34:23.587
I wanted to give it
some more time,

34:23.655 --> 34:25.522
but once he got it
into his head to leave,

34:25.590 --> 34:26.724
that was that.

34:26.791 --> 34:28.824
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.167
Shane,

34:39.103 --> 34:40.337
I want you to know
that that offer

34:40.404 --> 34:42.638
for those roping lessons
still stands.

34:44.341 --> 34:48.677
And I was figuring that,
well, if you got good enough,

34:48.745 --> 34:51.045
there's a little britches rodeo

34:51.114 --> 34:53.382
in High River in June.

34:53.449 --> 34:54.683
I know that might sound
kind of lame to you,

34:54.751 --> 34:57.219
but, well, the kids that
compete in those

34:57.287 --> 34:58.620
are pretty fierce,

34:58.688 --> 35:00.922
and after that,
you have high school rodeos.

35:00.990 --> 35:02.723
You know, eventually
they have father-son teams--

35:02.791 --> 35:05.626
you're not my father!
Not like that.

35:06.561 --> 35:08.629
I am your father.

35:13.535 --> 35:15.403
Now, listen,

35:15.470 --> 35:18.338
I'm gonna keep this pony
here for you

35:18.406 --> 35:20.274
and you can come
and visit him

35:20.341 --> 35:21.441
anytime you want,

35:21.509 --> 35:22.842
in case you change
your mind.

35:22.911 --> 35:24.244
Hey, Shane.

35:24.312 --> 35:26.746
If you still wanna go,
we have to hit the road.

35:26.814 --> 35:28.782
<i>What? You're going?</i>

35:28.849 --> 35:30.050
<i>No, no,
you guys can't go yet.</i>

35:30.118 --> 35:32.451
There is an insane mess
back at the house--

35:32.519 --> 35:33.752
they could officially
declare the living room

35:33.820 --> 35:35.187
a disaster area,

35:35.255 --> 35:37.189
and if my baby's gonna have
a proper naming ceremony

35:37.257 --> 35:39.225
then I need everybody
in the family,

35:39.293 --> 35:41.360
and I mean everybody
to pitch in.

35:41.428 --> 35:43.095
You any good
with a broom?

35:43.163 --> 35:44.563
Uh... yeah.

35:44.631 --> 35:46.098
Yeah, good.
All right, you can sweep.

35:46.166 --> 35:47.433
Or would you rather mop?

35:47.500 --> 35:48.833
You know what?
You can do both.

35:48.901 --> 35:50.568
And I'll tell you what,
if we get in done in time,

35:50.636 --> 35:51.702
you can get to know
your new niece.

36:06.418 --> 36:08.452
<i>I found this
in the welcoming basket,</i>

36:08.519 --> 36:10.955
but I figured you needed it
more than we do.

36:11.022 --> 36:13.157
Oh, um, thanks,
but...

36:13.224 --> 36:15.259
<i>No? Oh.</i>

36:15.327 --> 36:16.860
How 'bout one of these?

36:16.928 --> 36:18.062
Well, I wouldn't say no to that.

36:23.167 --> 36:25.768
Did Peter ever tell you
about his great Uncle Burt?

36:25.836 --> 36:28.171
Thank you.
Um, the one in Victoria?

36:28.238 --> 36:30.173
Mm-hm.
Lifelong bachelor.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.507
Well, that's how my mother

36:31.575 --> 36:34.477
used to describe her brother
anyway.

36:34.544 --> 36:37.512
Yeah,
he opened a little B&B

36:37.580 --> 36:40.215
with his best friend,
Alan.

36:40.283 --> 36:42.084
Mmm.
Another lifelong bachelor?

36:42.151 --> 36:43.818
Mm-hmm.

36:43.886 --> 36:46.921
See, those things weren't
talked about in those days.

36:46.990 --> 36:49.757
Uh... and then there's
his aunt Enid.

36:49.825 --> 36:51.026
Mm.

36:51.094 --> 36:52.559
He never told you
about her?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.028
No.

36:54.096 --> 36:56.797
Well, she had a baby boy
when she was fifteen,

36:56.865 --> 37:00.034
and they brought him up
as Enid's brother,

37:00.102 --> 37:01.668
not her son.

37:02.804 --> 37:06.740
See, Lou, I just wanted
to say that...

37:06.808 --> 37:09.642
That every family has
a skeleton or two.

37:09.710 --> 37:12.745
Yeah, I think my dad
has a whole graveyard.

37:20.821 --> 37:21.754
<i>Here goes nothing.</i>

37:26.660 --> 37:28.127
So far, so good.

37:28.194 --> 37:30.662
It's an auspicious beginning.

37:32.331 --> 37:34.566
So welcome, everyone.

37:35.501 --> 37:37.502
Family and old friends,

37:39.639 --> 37:41.239
new friends,

37:41.306 --> 37:43.107
<i>and new family.</i>

37:44.109 --> 37:45.677
<i>So we're gathered here today</i>

37:45.745 --> 37:49.312
to welcome Lou and Peter's
daughter.

37:50.615 --> 37:52.349
And just as family changes

37:53.284 --> 37:55.553
with the addition
of each new member,

37:55.620 --> 37:57.087
so do traditions.

37:58.289 --> 38:00.991
My great grandfather,
Samuel Bartlett,

38:01.059 --> 38:04.193
was born during
the storm of the century.

38:04.261 --> 38:06.062
His parents couldn't
get to a church,

38:06.129 --> 38:09.298
so they held
their own christening

38:09.366 --> 38:12.301
right in front
of this fireplace.

38:12.369 --> 38:16.673
This, this is Samuel Bartlett's
stone right here.

38:17.608 --> 38:19.507
So, I guess you could say
that what started out

38:19.576 --> 38:21.043
as a Bartlett tradition

38:21.110 --> 38:24.846
has become a Barlett-Fleming
Morris tradition,

38:26.482 --> 38:29.718
<i>as unique as the baby herself.</i>

38:29.786 --> 38:31.519
Yeah.

38:31.588 --> 38:34.655
<i>So now, let's welcome
this beautiful baby</i>

38:34.723 --> 38:38.392
<i>and bless her with a name
of her own.</i>

38:38.460 --> 38:39.860
Yes. Hello.

38:43.264 --> 38:44.699
Mallory.
Would you hold her please?

38:44.766 --> 38:46.333
No, no,
you're the godmother.

38:46.401 --> 38:47.468
Come here,

38:47.535 --> 38:49.169
I know you're not
gonna drop her.

38:52.773 --> 38:53.907
<i>All right.</i>

38:56.176 --> 39:01.615
Catherine Marion Minnie
Fleming Morris,

39:01.682 --> 39:05.351
may your life be filled
with fortune and joy

39:05.419 --> 39:07.419
and your heart filled with love.

39:07.487 --> 39:09.822
<i>And bear that name
and honour it</i>

39:09.889 --> 39:13.492
and grow to be a most wise
and understanding person!

39:13.559 --> 39:14.627
Muah!

39:16.129 --> 39:19.197
This is your stone
right here.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.567
Yay!

39:26.739 --> 39:27.805
Thank you.

39:29.808 --> 39:32.309
Thank you, everyone,
for being here.

39:32.377 --> 39:35.113
But, um, our little Catherine
isn't the only new member

39:35.180 --> 39:36.380
of the family.

39:36.448 --> 39:38.149
So come here, Shane.

39:39.083 --> 39:40.784
- Uh, no.
- No, it's okay, really.

39:41.318 --> 39:43.086
<i>If I were you, Shane,
I'd do as she says.</i>

39:44.455 --> 39:48.258
<i>Come on, it's okay.</i>

39:48.325 --> 39:49.693
Okay. So, uh...

39:49.761 --> 39:51.094
Amy, what do you think?
This one?

39:51.162 --> 39:52.896
I think it's perfect.

39:52.964 --> 39:54.464
This is my stone.

39:54.532 --> 39:55.998
<i>And this one over here
is mine.</i>

39:56.066 --> 39:57.633
This will be your
stone, right between ours.

39:57.701 --> 39:59.101
The Shane stone.

40:04.274 --> 40:05.808
Welcome to the family,
Shane.

40:15.151 --> 40:16.217
Thanks.

40:20.422 --> 40:22.891
Hey. When these sisters
invite you into this family,

40:22.958 --> 40:24.959
watch out,
it's a game changer.

40:28.163 --> 40:29.329
Catherine would like
some cake.

40:46.742 --> 40:48.076
You know,
that was pretty damn special

40:48.144 --> 40:50.879
what Lou did for Shane.

40:50.947 --> 40:52.714
Yeah.

40:52.782 --> 40:53.916
Yeah.

40:53.983 --> 40:55.450
You still have issues
with her?

40:55.518 --> 40:57.452
I'm not exactly feeling
the love from your family, Tim.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.020
I just don't understand
why you always insist

40:59.087 --> 41:00.121
on dragging me along.

41:00.188 --> 41:02.556
Because we're together.

41:02.624 --> 41:05.159
Oh, are you sure
about that?

41:05.227 --> 41:06.693
'Cause I don't know,
I just can't help feeling

41:06.761 --> 41:08.195
like maybe we rushed
into a relationship

41:08.263 --> 41:09.630
a little too quickly.

41:09.697 --> 41:11.966
Okay. All right, fine.

41:12.034 --> 41:13.134
You wanna break up
again?

41:13.201 --> 41:14.867
No, I just...

41:16.203 --> 41:19.005
You know, like you said,
"slow and steady."

41:20.507 --> 41:22.642
Slow and steady,
that's it.

41:29.050 --> 41:31.850
<i>My cousin's gonna be very happy
to see this.</i>

41:31.918 --> 41:33.385
You wouldn't happen
to have any more cousins

41:33.453 --> 41:35.988
in need of a motorcycle
mechanic, would you?

41:36.056 --> 41:38.790
'Cause between paying rent
and going to school,

41:38.858 --> 41:40.859
I could use
a little extra cash.

41:40.927 --> 41:42.361
Well, if you can
handle the workload,

41:42.429 --> 41:44.663
I can definitely
put the word out.

41:44.730 --> 41:46.397
All right.

41:46.465 --> 41:47.966
- Good job.
- Thank you.

41:50.202 --> 41:51.269
Well, we'll see you, Dad.

41:51.337 --> 41:52.837
Thanks for coming
to the rescue.

41:52.904 --> 41:55.639
I figure that fireplace will
last another hundred years.

41:55.707 --> 41:57.041
Oh, you bet.

41:57.109 --> 41:58.609
That's why next time
you're down this way,

41:58.677 --> 42:00.311
I'm taking you fishing.

42:00.379 --> 42:02.346
Peter says you
know some good spots

42:02.413 --> 42:04.014
up in the high country.

42:04.082 --> 42:07.617
Oh, I'm gonna miss
your sweet little face.

42:07.685 --> 42:08.751
Yes, I am.

42:10.455 --> 42:11.888
Okay...

42:11.956 --> 42:14.458
Time to go back
to momma.

42:14.525 --> 42:16.526
You couldn't ask
for a better one.

42:16.594 --> 42:20.596
Well, she's got a pretty
fabulous grandmother too.

42:21.631 --> 42:22.965
Oh... it's okay.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.368
She's gonna miss you.

42:25.435 --> 42:28.837
- Safe trip, guys.
- Bye now.

42:34.610 --> 42:37.612
Hey, what's going on?
You okay?

42:37.679 --> 42:40.315
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

42:40.383 --> 42:44.119
I'm actually gonna
miss Grandma Grace.

42:48.324 --> 42:51.992
- We'll talk.
- Yeah, we'll talk.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.263
See ya.

42:56.331 --> 42:57.731
Soon, I hope.

42:58.666 --> 42:59.933
I guess.

43:00.001 --> 43:01.068
Hey.

43:08.409 --> 43:09.475
Hey.

43:10.677 --> 43:11.744
Shane.

43:13.213 --> 43:14.813
You can call me anytime,
hm?

43:14.881 --> 43:17.116
<i>You think about the summer.</i>

43:17.184 --> 43:18.984
<i>It's wide open.</i>

43:28.194 --> 43:29.094
He hates me.

43:29.162 --> 43:30.962
No he doesn't.

43:31.030 --> 43:33.598
He's just got a lot of stuff
to work out right now--

43:33.666 --> 43:35.400
We all do--

43:35.468 --> 43:37.869
But he'll get over it.

43:39.938 --> 43:42.039
That fireplace looks good.

43:42.107 --> 43:44.908
At least as good
as before.

43:46.677 --> 43:49.145
How 'bout that
naming ceremony?

43:50.081 --> 43:52.115
Probably the best one ever.

43:52.183 --> 43:53.616
