03:00.390 --> 03:01.516

We're gonna have
a little flat meeting in the kitchen

03:06.688 --> 03:08.273
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.266
You don't have to come,

04:25.350 --> 04:29.228
but I thought I'd extend an invitation
to you just in case.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.480
Um...

04:30.563 --> 04:33.775
There's a lot of stuff
on the floor down here, Petyr.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.985
Like this, it seems... I don't...

04:36.569 --> 04:39.280
Oh, it's a spinal column. Yuck.

04:39.364 --> 04:40.698
And I was thinking,

04:40.782 --> 04:43.701
maybe I should just
bring a broom down here for you

04:43.785 --> 04:47.288
if you wanted to sweep up
some of the skeletons.

04:47.372 --> 04:48.831
I don't know. You know, maybe...

04:48.998 --> 04:50.458
(SNARLING)

04:50.541 --> 04:51.584
Okay.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.421
I got you this chicken.

(CLUCKING)

04:59.592 --> 05:00.969
Is Petyr coming?

05:01.052 --> 05:02.261
Should we be worried?

05:02.345 --> 05:04.013
Petyr's 8,000 years old.

05:04.097 --> 05:06.224
We're not going
to have Petyr at the meeting.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.268
Okay, so I wanted to have a quick chat

05:09.352 --> 05:11.312
about flat responsibilities

05:11.396 --> 05:15.608
because, guys, I think
that we're not all pulling our weight here.

05:15.692 --> 05:18.695
We're not just
pointing the finger at you, Deacon.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.154
You're a cool guy, but you're not

05:20.238 --> 05:22.156
pulling your weight in the flat.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.909
Well, I'm glad to hear that I'm cool.
(CHUCKLES)

05:25.618 --> 05:26.845
No, that's not the point though.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.371
- You missed it.
- No, I know, I know.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.540
Yeah, it's not a flat meeting
about how cool you are.

05:30.623 --> 05:31.684
DEACON: I do my flat chores.

05:31.708 --> 05:32.810
- No, you don't!
- Yes, I do.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.520
No, you don't. This is why we're
having the flat meeting.

05:34.544 --> 05:35.753
The point is, Deacon,

05:35.837 --> 05:38.172
that you have
not done the dishes for five years.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.298
Vladislav is right.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.010
It's unacceptable
to have so many bloody dishes

05:42.093 --> 05:43.803
all over this bench like that.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.014
I'm so embarrassed
when people come over here.

05:46.097 --> 05:48.391
What does it matter?
You bring them over, you kill them!

05:48.474 --> 05:49.475
Yeah.

05:49.559 --> 05:51.227
Vampires don't do dishes.

05:51.310 --> 05:54.981
VIAGO: <i>Deacon's like
the rebellious young vampire.</i>

05:55.064 --> 05:58.985
<i>He's always doing crazy things,
saying crazy things.</i>

05:59.068 --> 06:02.113
<i>He's just like the young bad boy
of the group.</i>

06:02.864 --> 06:04.073
Okay, so

06:05.575 --> 06:08.953
one day I was selling my wares,

06:10.246 --> 06:13.041
<i>and I walked past this old creepy castle,</i>

06:13.124 --> 06:14.834
<i>and I look at it and think,</i>

06:15.918 --> 06:17.670
"Very old and creepy."

06:17.754 --> 06:21.215
<i>And then this creature flies at me.</i>

06:21.299 --> 06:24.385
<i>It dragged me back to this dark dungeon</i>

06:24.886 --> 06:26.929
<i>and bit into my neck.</i>

06:27.472 --> 06:29.724
<i>And just at the point of death,</i>

06:29.807 --> 06:34.479
<i>this creature forced me
to suck its foul blood,</i>

06:34.562 --> 06:37.857
and then it opened its wings like this

06:38.357 --> 06:41.903
and hovered above me, screeching,

06:41.986 --> 06:43.905
(MIMICS SCREECHING)

06:47.742 --> 06:49.285
And it was Petyr.

06:51.621 --> 06:53.498
And we're still friends today.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.291
Vlad, you were great.

06:55.374 --> 06:58.711
You put out the recycling,
which was really cool.

06:58.795 --> 07:03.216
And the other day,
I dragged a man's body down the hallway

07:03.299 --> 07:05.676
and noticed that there was no dust.

07:07.303 --> 07:10.223
Like, I kind of...
I kind of swept the hallway.

07:10.306 --> 07:13.559

07:13.643 --> 07:16.062

- Yes.

VLADISLAV:
<i>When I first became a vampire,</i>

07:44.382 --> 07:46.259
I was quite tyrannical.

07:46.342 --> 07:50.555
I was known for, uh,
torturing a lot of people.

07:53.558 --> 07:55.685
This is my torture chamber.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.188
<i>I don't come in here often anymore.</i>

07:59.856 --> 08:03.609
I tended to torture
when I was in a bad place.

08:03.693 --> 08:08.614

poke someone with implements.</i>

08:08.698 --> 08:11.409
I was known as Vladislav the Poker.

08:13.786 --> 08:16.455
It's been like this the whole time, okay?

08:16.539 --> 08:20.042
DEACON: <i>Viago is a little pedantic.</i>

08:20.126 --> 08:22.253
The washing and the rubbish, I did that.

08:22.336 --> 08:26.257
Deacon, on dishes,
and it's still hasn't moved in five years.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.885
He was an 18th century dandy,

08:29.218 --> 08:31.679
<i>so he can be very fussy.</i>

08:31.762 --> 08:33.014
He nags and nags.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.765
...went in the lounge the other day,

08:34.849 --> 08:38.895
and there was
blood all over my nice antique couch.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.688
Which one, the red one?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.648
Well, it's red now, yeah.

08:42.732 --> 08:45.401
If you're going to eat
a victim on my nice clean couch,

08:45.484 --> 08:48.279
put down some newspaper on the floor
and some towels.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.530
It's not hard to do.

08:49.614 --> 08:53.159
We're vampires.
We don't put down towels.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.161
Some vampires do.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.205
Well, not serious ones.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.002
<i>obviously there's
going to be a lot of tension.</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:06.505
There's tension in any flatting situation.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.925
It's settled then. We'll all do our jobs,

09:09.008 --> 09:11.302
starting with a certain Deacon...

09:11.385 --> 09:12.678
I will do my dishes!

10:14.156 --> 10:18.160
I became a vampire when I was 16,

10:18.327 --> 10:20.997
and that is why I always look 16.

10:21.706 --> 10:22.832
In those days, of course,

10:22.915 --> 10:25.084
life was tough for a 16-year-old.

VIAGO: <i>Vampires have
had a pretty bad rep.</i>

10:39.265 --> 10:43.644
We're not these mopey old creatures
who live in castles.

10:43.728 --> 10:46.689
Well, some... Most of us are. A lot are.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.024
But there are also those of us

10:48.107 --> 10:49.358
who like to flat together

10:49.442 --> 10:52.194
in really small countries,
like New Zealand.

I don't know if you know
that the Nazis lost that war.

11:19.472 --> 11:21.557
If you were a Nazi, after the war...

11:22.808 --> 11:24.268
<i>And if you were a vampire...</i>

11:26.729 --> 11:29.690
And if you were a Nazi vampire,

11:30.608 --> 11:31.734
no way.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.069
<i>I was out of there.</i>

12:17.905 --> 12:20.658
<i>Ja,</i> I came to this country for love.

12:21.367 --> 12:24.203
Uh... There was a girl, human girl,

12:24.286 --> 12:28.416
and I thought she was fantastic.

12:28.499 --> 12:30.876
She was absolutely amazing.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.545
<i>I was smitten.</i>

12:32.628 --> 12:36.382
<i>Her family emigrated to New Zealand.</i>

12:36.465 --> 12:38.342
And I thought,

"You know what? To hell with it.
I'm going to go.

12:40.970 --> 12:43.597
"I'm going to chase her

And when I got here,
she had found someone else.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.993
She had fallen in love

13:04.785 --> 13:07.788
and she was married.

She gave me this before she left.

There she is.

That's me. I put myself in there, too.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.688
She told me it was pure silver.

Yeah, it's really good, yeah. Like it.

14:37.628 --> 14:40.881
One of the unfortunate things
about not having a reflection

14:40.965 --> 14:44.760
is that you don't know
exactly what you look like.

- No. Change it.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.643
- I feel...
- MAN: Homos!

16:22.900 --> 16:24.318
The trouble with being a vampire

16:24.401 --> 16:27.613
is you have to be invited in to go in.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.366
DEACON: We'd like to
come into the bar, please.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.009
Can you invite us into the bar, please?

16:32.034 --> 16:34.119
$5, you can walk in.

- VIAGO: Julie.
- Hello.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.277
- How embarrassing.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.805
He's a guy I used to work with,
when I was human.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.348
- Before, when I was human.
- Gone?

16:54.431 --> 16:56.368
Yeah, he's gone. I've been
draining him all night. (CHUCKLES)

16:56.392 --> 16:57.726

VLADISLAV: What are you
doing tonight?

17:03.899 --> 17:05.210
Are you going to kill some perverts?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.336
CHILD: Yeah,
we're meeting a pedophile.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.361
- Cool.
- CHILD: Yeah.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.113
Okay. Let's just go to Big Kumara.

- BOUNCER: Have a good night, guys.
- Yeah. You, too. Bye.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.534
Big Kumara is vampire-owned

17:13.617 --> 17:15.368
and so we can always get in.

17:15.452 --> 17:19.205
It's the hottest night spot
for vampires in Wellington.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.665
Come on in, guys. Come on in.

some people to the house.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.723
- Sure.
- Perhaps some virgins?

17:35.806 --> 17:36.974
Virgins? Yep, okay.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.685
Any kind of preference

Yep, ladies.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.815
Perhaps a guy.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.066
One of each?

17:46.150 --> 17:47.568
One of each should be cool.

- Okay.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.301
DEACON: Young.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.219
But not kids?

18:14.303 --> 18:15.554
Not kids.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.181
18 to 30?

18:17.723 --> 18:19.725
Definitely younger than yourself.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.894
Okay. So, 18 to 30.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.121
- So, it's a dinner party.
- Great.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.039
- I'll be there. You'll be there.
- Yes, dinner party.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.232
Yes, we will dress up.

- Okay, great.
- And then eat them.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.321
- Okay. Great.
- Should be fun.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.299
I was just wondering
if we could talk about the...

18:34.323 --> 18:36.909
Do you know of a night dentist?

18:36.992 --> 18:38.368
Because I have this thing here.

18:38.452 --> 18:41.413
I was just wondering
if we could talk about the deal.

18:41.497 --> 18:43.081
- Hmm?
- The deal.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.833
The dishes?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.502
No, you know, the deal.

18:46.585 --> 18:50.798
The deal is that he is going
to give me eternal life,

18:50.881 --> 18:52.841
um, which is

18:53.801 --> 18:55.344
very exciting.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.322
Well, I just feel like
I've kind of reached my potential,

18:57.346 --> 18:59.681
and I wouldn't
want to kind of get any older before...

18:59.765 --> 19:02.267
I just feel like I'm the best version
of myself that I can be.

19:02.351 --> 19:04.454
It's just that it's been
four and a half years, and I just...

19:04.478 --> 19:05.813
But it's doing your pot plants,

19:05.896 --> 19:07.231
I'm doing your dry cleaning,

19:07.314 --> 19:08.833
I'm now doing your dishes,
and I'm doing...

19:08.857 --> 19:10.126
- I'm just wondering...
- And the dentist.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.169
- And the dentist.
- The dentist.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.504
And it's just taking an awful long time.

19:12.528 --> 19:14.172
- So I was just wondering if I...
- Be gone!

- Deacon, no, it's sunlight!
- I'm coming for you!

48:17.104 --> 48:18.772
It's sunlight out there!

48:18.855 --> 48:21.984
VIAGO: It's sunlight! It's sunlight!

48:23.944 --> 48:26.280
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

48:27.906 --> 48:29.616
I was too late.

48:34.830 --> 48:37.124
(VIAGO SOBBING)

48:38.458 --> 48:40.294
VLADISLAV: Turn that thing off.

48:41.086 --> 48:42.462
Our friend has just been killed

48:42.546 --> 48:44.339
in a fatal sunlight accident.

48:59.354 --> 49:01.648
DEACON: So this is
what I think happened.

49:01.732 --> 49:05.652
The Vampire Hunter
has broken through the window here,

49:06.653 --> 49:10.490
has impacted the table,
breaking the table leg.

49:10.574 --> 49:12.326
Then he has come this way,

49:13.035 --> 49:14.077
towards the tomb.

49:14.161 --> 49:16.121
(GAGGING)

49:16.204 --> 49:18.832
DEACON: Crucifix! Cover the crucifix!

49:21.752 --> 49:25.505
And then Petyr has burst from the tomb,

49:25.589 --> 49:29.009
pushed the tomb lid
onto the Vampire Hunter,

49:29.092 --> 49:31.720
and then the sunlight
has come through here

49:31.803 --> 49:33.555
and burned Petyr alive.

49:34.306 --> 49:37.643
I think this is just a table leg,
which is sanded down.

49:37.726 --> 49:39.436
Do you think he hand-sanded that or...

49:39.519 --> 49:41.855
- Yes. Imagine that stuck in your...
- Your leg.

49:42.439 --> 49:44.524
VIAGO: It's quite
shocking down here, Nick.

49:44.608 --> 49:47.903
Look, here's our sweet Petyr

49:47.986 --> 49:50.113
- burned to a sizzle.
- NICK: Oh! Fuck. Yeah.

49:50.197 --> 49:51.466
VLADISLAV: I can't figure out this.

49:51.490 --> 49:52.616
This is the Vampire Hunter.

49:52.699 --> 49:54.427
- Is this his front or his back?
- NICK: Oh, who's this guy?

49:54.451 --> 49:57.120
VIAGO: Look at his
bloody head on back-to-front.

49:57.204 --> 49:58.264
Twist it the other way, the other way.

49:58.288 --> 49:59.289
VLADISLAV: This way.

49:59.373 --> 50:01.958
VIAGO: See who this guy is here.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.712
- Hmm. Typical macho type.
- Yuck!

50:05.796 --> 50:06.797
Hideous.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.215
NICK: Oh, shit.

50:09.299 --> 50:10.926
I know that guy, actually.

50:11.009 --> 50:12.135
VLADISLAV: You know him?

50:12.219 --> 50:13.637
- Yeah.
- VIAGO: What?

50:13.720 --> 50:15.389
I saw him the other night in town.

50:16.139 --> 50:17.808
- Told him I was a vampire.
- VIAGO: What?

50:17.891 --> 50:20.143
I thought he was joking.
He said he was a vampire hunter.

50:20.227 --> 50:22.062
You let a vampire hunter into our house?

50:22.145 --> 50:23.790
I didn't let him in.
I just gave him my email.

50:23.814 --> 50:25.023
- He didn't...
- VIAGO: Nick!

50:25.649 --> 50:26.983
I will tear out your tongue

50:27.067 --> 50:28.753
- and shove it down your ass!
- NICK: Deacon...

50:28.777 --> 50:29.778
VIAGO: Guys...

(DEACON SNARLING)

50:31.238 --> 50:32.572
NICK: Fucking hell!

50:34.074 --> 50:35.492

50:39.830 --> 50:41.289
(DEACON GRUNTING)

50:42.749 --> 50:44.292
Tear out your tongue!

50:46.878 --> 50:48.755
DEACON: You kill Petyr
with your big mouth!

50:49.423 --> 50:50.590
NICK: It was a mistake!

50:50.674 --> 50:51.800
Get up. Take a breath.

50:52.342 --> 50:54.428
DEACON: Get up
and stand on this ceiling like a man.

51:01.268 --> 51:03.079
We can talk about this, okay?
We can talk about it.

51:03.103 --> 51:04.271
DEACON: I'll kill you!

51:04.354 --> 51:05.439
I'm already dead!

51:12.404 --> 51:13.798
VIAGO: There's someone at the door.

51:13.822 --> 51:15.365
I'll go. I'll go.

51:23.123 --> 51:24.624
Oh, shit.

51:26.126 --> 51:27.126
Yeah, good evening, sir.

51:27.169 --> 51:28.170
Hello, Police.

51:28.253 --> 51:30.630
Hi, I'm Constable O'Leary.
This is Constable Minogue.

51:30.714 --> 51:31.941
We're just responding to reports

51:31.965 --> 51:33.675
of a possible forced entry,

51:33.759 --> 51:36.136
and also
a rather large amount of shrieking.

51:36.219 --> 51:37.447
Just wondering
if maybe we could come in,

51:37.471 --> 51:39.055
just have a wee look around.

51:39.139 --> 51:40.223
Okay.

51:40.515 --> 51:42.809
What's with the... Hello.
What's with the, um, camera?

51:42.893 --> 51:45.413
Yeah, obviously we're just here
'cause there was a phone call from

51:45.437 --> 51:47.731
a member of the public
about a bit of a disturbance.

51:47.814 --> 51:49.858
Um... Some loud noises,

51:49.941 --> 51:51.781
- possibly a forced entry, wasn't there?
- Hmm.

51:51.818 --> 51:53.487
And also maybe
a bit of smoke coming out.

51:53.570 --> 51:55.006
So we're just checking over the scene,

51:55.030 --> 51:58.200
making sure everything's above board,
so to speak,

51:58.283 --> 52:00.443
and making sure no one's in danger,
that kind of thing.

52:00.494 --> 52:01.929
We might go up
and have a wee look up there,

52:01.953 --> 52:03.580
if that's all right with you.

52:03.789 --> 52:07.250
- Just part of the job. Yep.
- Come on, mate, you lead the way.

52:07.334 --> 52:08.334
Okay.

52:08.376 --> 52:10.337
- Smells a bit weird in here, too, mate.
- Yeah.

52:10.420 --> 52:11.963
What do you call that?

52:13.673 --> 52:15.217
Barbecue.

52:18.178 --> 52:21.765
You will not notice anything
out of the ordinary.

52:22.224 --> 52:23.683
No, we certainly hope not.

52:23.767 --> 52:25.560
Let's just keep going.

52:25.644 --> 52:26.829
POLICEWOMAN: Yeah, hi there, guys.
STU: Hello.

52:26.853 --> 52:27.896
- How are you?
- Good.

52:27.979 --> 52:29.499
POLICEMAN: Hey, fellas.
VLADISLAV: Hello.

52:29.523 --> 52:31.918
POLICEWOMAN: Is this the room we've
heard all the shouting coming from?

52:31.942 --> 52:33.151
DEACON: That was me.

52:33.235 --> 52:35.087
POLICEWOMAN: Yeah, okay.
We've had a couple of reports, okay?

52:35.111 --> 52:37.548
There's a couple of people not that
happy about the level of noise here.

52:37.572 --> 52:39.217
- Okay. The neighbors?
- POLICEMAN: You can't keep screaming

52:39.241 --> 52:40.301
when there's this many
people around, mate.

52:40.325 --> 52:41.719
You've got neighbors on either side.

52:41.743 --> 52:42.911
(WHISPERING) Really nervous.

52:42.994 --> 52:44.788
I've hypnotized those cops.

52:44.871 --> 52:46.248
I'm not a great hypnotizer,

52:46.331 --> 52:48.250
so it could wear off any second.

52:48.333 --> 52:50.961
I really hope that those guys
don't kill those police

52:51.044 --> 52:53.088
because it will mean
more police will come,

52:53.171 --> 52:54.631
possibly even Christians,

52:54.714 --> 52:57.300
which is totally the last thing
we need in this house.

52:57.384 --> 52:58.844
I can see you're having a good time.

52:58.927 --> 53:01.555
End of the day,
we've got to keep the peace, okay?

53:01.638 --> 53:03.139
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:03.890 --> 53:05.183
See what I'm seeing?

53:05.267 --> 53:06.627
POLICEWOMAN: What's that, Minogue?

53:07.602 --> 53:08.728
You're joking.

53:10.146 --> 53:11.565
Not a smoke alarm in sight.

53:11.648 --> 53:13.316
POLICEMAN: No smoke detectors, mate.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.819
Rule number one, smoke detectors.

53:15.902 --> 53:17.112
Okay.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.823
Rule number two,
maybe not so many barbecues inside.

53:19.906 --> 53:21.386
- Sort it out, fellas.
- DEACON: Okay.

53:21.741 --> 53:23.928
POLICEMAN: Barbecue smells
really strong down here, doesn't it?

53:23.952 --> 53:25.012
- What kind of marinade...
- Yeah.

53:25.036 --> 53:26.097
What kind of marinade did you use?

53:26.121 --> 53:27.247
Who's this guy?

53:27.539 --> 53:31.167
Um... That's a friend
who came to our party.

53:31.251 --> 53:32.586
Mate, are you all right?

53:32.669 --> 53:34.063
- He's drunk.
- That's what I thought.

53:34.087 --> 53:35.338
- Drunk guy.
- Yeah.

53:35.422 --> 53:37.716
Look, you can't
just leave him down here like that, okay?

53:37.799 --> 53:39.259
This guy's not having a good time.

53:39.342 --> 53:41.094
He's gonna feel
terrible tomorrow morning.

53:41.177 --> 53:42.971
Well, his soul is in hell, so don't worry.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.240
Well, I don't know where his soul is,

53:44.264 --> 53:45.700
but all I am saying is,
where is his blanket?

53:45.724 --> 53:47.159
Okay, just check on him in the morning.

53:47.183 --> 53:48.578
There's a big slab of concrete on him.

53:48.602 --> 53:49.704
VIAGO: Yeah.
POLICEMAN: You could move that.

53:49.728 --> 53:50.830
That's definitely not
gonna be comfortable.

53:50.854 --> 53:53.082
- See anything else in here, Minogue?
- No, I've seen enough.

53:53.106 --> 53:54.983
- Okay.
- Hang on a minute.

53:55.066 --> 53:56.151
What have we got here?

53:57.944 --> 53:59.130
POLICEWOMAN: What is that?
VIAGO: This?

53:59.154 --> 54:00.155
- This?
- Oh, this?

54:00.238 --> 54:01.948
You can see it as clearly as I can.

54:02.032 --> 54:04.618
Adhesive, mate. That's a flammable.

54:04.701 --> 54:06.453
Then you've got a lamp on top of that,

54:06.536 --> 54:08.204
directly underneath a power source.

54:08.288 --> 54:09.414
That is quite bad, guys.

54:09.497 --> 54:10.808
- It's very bad.
- It's a very bad combination.

54:10.832 --> 54:12.268
And no smoke detectors again,
are there?

54:12.292 --> 54:14.377
- No.
- Yes, there are.

54:14.461 --> 54:16.463
Yes, there are.
I see them, yeah. That's good.

54:16.546 --> 54:17.815
- Lots to think about, guys.
- Okay.

54:17.839 --> 54:18.983
Yeah, lots to think about there, guys.

54:19.007 --> 54:20.359
- Well, shall we carry on?
- Next flat meeting. <i>Ja?</i>

54:20.383 --> 54:21.861
Yeah, good thinking. That's the thing.

54:21.885 --> 54:23.279
Just have a bit of dialogue about it.

54:23.303 --> 54:24.471
VIAGO: Okay.

54:24.554 --> 54:26.056
They've got a really good point.

54:26.139 --> 54:27.182
Wait. Let's kill them.

54:27.307 --> 54:28.308
No.

54:28.391 --> 54:30.727
Well, let's just see
what other safety points they have,

54:30.810 --> 54:32.812
and then maybe we'll kill them.

54:41.613 --> 54:46.493
I call into session
this trial of Nick of Wellington.

54:51.623 --> 54:53.333
VLADISLAV: Read the charges.

54:53.792 --> 54:55.669
"Problems we have with Nick.

54:56.670 --> 54:58.088
"Number One."

54:58.171 --> 55:00.090
You brought a human into our house,

55:00.173 --> 55:01.925
which is a big no-no
in the vampire world.

55:02.008 --> 55:03.259
Stu is okay, though?

55:03.343 --> 55:04.594
Yeah. Stu is fine,

55:04.678 --> 55:07.138
so I guess we'll just cross that one out.

55:07.639 --> 55:08.640
Uh...

55:12.102 --> 55:13.788
VIAGO: Thank you, Stu.
VLADISLAV: Thank you, Stu.

55:13.812 --> 55:16.356
VIAGO: So, the new Number One.

55:16.439 --> 55:19.150
"Nick's been
telling people he's a vampire.

55:19.234 --> 55:21.111
"That, in turn, resulted

55:21.194 --> 55:25.532
"in an unwanted visit
from a vampire hunter.

55:25.615 --> 55:27.283
"Crime Number Two."

55:27.367 --> 55:29.285
This is quite a biggie, Nick.

55:29.369 --> 55:31.955
The Vampire Hunter who killed Petyr.

55:33.081 --> 55:34.708
That actually should've...

55:34.791 --> 55:36.292
That should've been Crime Number One,

55:36.376 --> 55:38.378
but we wanted to build up to that.

55:38.461 --> 55:39.629
Number Three,

55:39.713 --> 55:41.339
Deacon doesn't like that you wear

55:41.423 --> 55:43.216
the same jacket as him,

55:43.299 --> 55:46.678
and he would like you
to find your own original style.

55:47.679 --> 55:52.517
For these crimes of which,
we, the Vampire Council, find you guilty,

55:52.934 --> 55:56.730
you shall be banished
from our flat indefinitely.

55:56.896 --> 55:58.815
- Indefinitely.
- Indefinitely.

55:58.898 --> 55:59.898
So I can come back?

55:59.941 --> 56:03.278
No, no.
"Indefinitely" means there is no end.

56:03.361 --> 56:04.380
- I thought it was like...
- I just think it...

56:04.404 --> 56:06.084
VIAGO: No,
"indefinite" means that it's not

56:06.114 --> 56:07.657
a definite thing, it can be changed.

56:07.741 --> 56:08.801
- Does it, though?
- Yes, but it's long.

56:08.825 --> 56:10.469
It could be tomorrow,
it could be six months.

56:10.493 --> 56:12.096
- No, it is not tomorrow.
- No, it won't be tomorrow.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.056
- Forget about it. You're banished.
- It's at least six months.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.331
- You're banished.
- That's it.

56:15.415 --> 56:16.809
VLADISLAV: But, Stu,
you can visit if you like.

56:16.833 --> 56:18.126
Thank you.

56:18.793 --> 56:22.422
DEACON: For your crimes,
you will be made to suffer

56:22.714 --> 56:25.050
the Procession of Shame.

56:25.133 --> 56:28.261
I asked them, Nick.
I asked them not to pass that sentence.

56:28.344 --> 56:30.513
We should do this immediately,
in my opinion.

56:30.597 --> 56:31.598
You didn't ask.

56:32.057 --> 56:34.434
You didn't ask. You were saying yes.

56:37.896 --> 56:39.707
- I didn't. Well, I...
- Well, this is what's going to happen.

56:39.731 --> 56:41.399
I still think it's quite extreme.

56:42.442 --> 56:45.862
Let us do the Procession of Shame now.

56:47.781 --> 56:48.799
VLADISLAV: Shame.
DEACON: Shame.

56:48.823 --> 56:50.033
VIAGO: Shame. Shame. Shame.

56:50.116 --> 56:51.260
VLADISLAV: Shame. Shame. Shame.

56:51.284 --> 56:52.285
DEACON: Shame!

56:52.368 --> 56:53.679
VIAGO: Bad vampire!
DEACON: Shame.

56:53.703 --> 56:54.704
VLADISLAV: Shame.

56:56.247 --> 56:57.499
Should we go, Stu?

57:03.171 --> 57:04.251
VIAGO: (WHISPERS) Bye, Stu.

57:07.801 --> 57:09.385
(GATE CREAKING)

to The Unholy Masquerade

a Guest of Honor.</i>

59:04.500 --> 59:06.961
And I don't know
if I should be saying this,

59:07.670 --> 59:09.422
but I heard a little rumor

59:09.505 --> 59:12.425

59:13.426 --> 59:14.802
might be me.

59:51.256 --> 59:54.092

59:54.175 --> 59:57.387
just had a reaction to the information

59:57.470 --> 01:00:00.390
that the Guest of Honor will be, um...

01:00:00.473 --> 01:00:01.641
The Beast.

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:09.315
The darkest part of my mind
is reserved for The Beast.

01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:11.210
We could tell you a thing or two
about The Beast.

01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:13.987
You should pray
that you never have to see The Beast.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.863
This one is called The Beast.

01:00:15.947 --> 01:00:19.033
And I said,
"Get your hands off my balls, Beast!"

01:00:19.117 --> 01:00:20.827
He may have told you some stories

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:23.413
about his great battle with The Beast.

01:00:23.496 --> 01:00:25.915
Yeah. "Oh, I fought The Beast on a cliff.

love Wesley Snipes, so it's...

Which pants do you want to wear?

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.140
Just look at the pants, Vlad.
Turn around and look at them.

01:01:06.164 --> 01:01:07.373
They're just pants!

I always look round
and make sure they're all laughing.

01:23:19.996 --> 01:23:21.873
If I see one of them is not quite laughing,

01:23:21.956 --> 01:23:23.142
I'll go, "Hey. Are you laughing?"

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:25.919
And then often I'll test you.
What were you laughing at, Clifton?

01:23:26.002 --> 01:23:27.629
- Eh?
- What are you laughing at now?

01:23:27.712 --> 01:23:29.631
- Just then?
- Yeah, but what?

01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:31.049
Oh, I don't know, 'cause you...

01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:32.532
Oh, test failed! Test failed! Yeah!

01:23:32.634 --> 01:23:34.010
(ALL SHOUTING AND LAUGHING)

01:23:34.094 --> 01:23:36.721
You're laughing now.
What are you laughing at now, though?

01:23:36.805 --> 01:23:37.889
I don't know 'cause...

01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:39.641
- Oh, another failure!
- (ALL LAUGHING)

01:23:40.892 --> 01:23:42.727
Well, what are you laughing at, Stu?

01:23:42.811 --> 01:23:44.312
I was laughing with the group.

01:23:44.396 --> 01:23:47.440
Yep. That's good. That's good.
Yeah, he's in. See? Yeah.

01:23:47.524 --> 01:23:49.609
Just pay attention. Pay attention.

01:23:49.693 --> 01:23:50.694
Laugh with the group.

01:23:50.777 --> 01:23:51.778
Laugh with the group.

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:30.668
You will not remember
the last hour and a half

01:25:30.752 --> 01:25:32.754
of what you have just seen.

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:37.717
You will forget the contents
of this movie.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.224
