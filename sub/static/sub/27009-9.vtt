10:42.475 --> 10:44.811
[coughs]

10:44.894 --> 10:46.896
[laughs]

10:46.980 --> 10:48.064
[coughs]

10:48.148 --> 10:51.109
Come on, Charlie. Make it the last night.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.903
Make it the last night.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.882
What the fuck are you doing here?

11:13.965 --> 11:15.300
You told me to come!

11:15.383 --> 11:18.636
Well, that was before my stupid brother
told my dad we were dating.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.430
What? Oh, no!

11:20.513 --> 11:23.349
Oh, yes. It was a fucking abortion.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.311
My dad broke a table,
breathed a bunch of booze on me,

11:26.394 --> 11:28.229
and then he shit himself and passed out.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.189
Jesus.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.858
Yeah, I was hoping
he wouldn't remember in the morning.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.193
Or he'd be dead.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.737
But he woke up today, sat me down,

11:35.820 --> 11:37.697
said he didn't want me spreading my thighs

11:37.780 --> 11:40.033
till I was at least old enough
to wait tables.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.993
[scoffs] You believe that shit?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.162
-[Mr. Fitzsimmons] Jesus!
-Whoa!

11:44.245 --> 11:46.456
Who the fuck are you talking to?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.917
You, you fucking bloated booze bag!

11:49.000 --> 11:52.587
You're lucky
I got a school bus to go drive.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.131
Now, where were we?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.507
I should go.

11:56.758 --> 12:00.720
If your dad finds out I'm here,
he's gonna beat the shit out of me.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.431
Suck my tongue, you fucking coward.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.850
[moaning]

12:05.934 --> 12:08.478
You're not afraid
of my big dumb dad, are you?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.731
Yes. I am. And your brother.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.233
[slurping]

12:13.316 --> 12:14.609
No, you're not.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.778
Seriously. I am. Ahh!

12:16.861 --> 12:18.863
I hate my whole fucking family!

12:18.947 --> 12:21.699
The only solution is for us
to run away and be together.

12:21.783 --> 12:22.909
Run away?

12:22.992 --> 12:26.329
Yeah, to the most romantic place on Earth.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.916
Pittsburgh, the city that never breathes.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.543
We can live
under one of their many bridges

12:32.627 --> 12:34.504
and sneak into Steeler games.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.880
What are you talking about?

12:35.964 --> 12:38.174
You hate your family too, don't you?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.176
Yeah, sure.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.304
You and me, we're both alone.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.598
All we've got is each other,
you dumb twat.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.392
But I don't think I can do that.

12:47.976 --> 12:52.146
[voice breaking] I knew it! Every fucking
person in my life shits on my dreams.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.315
Don't you do it too.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.609
I'm not trying to shit on anything!

12:56.693 --> 12:58.194
Well, I'm leaving tonight.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.905
I'll be in front of your house at six.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.366
If you want to come with me, be there.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.704
If not, then I guess this is
fuck off and die.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.920
[car engine]

13:20.383 --> 13:22.343
[Frank] Oh, Christ.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.933
[exhales]

13:29.017 --> 13:31.269
Gentle and nurturing.
Gentle and nurturing.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.812
Gentle and fucking nurturing.

13:34.063 --> 13:34.981
[Kevin] Who is it?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.232
It's your father.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.278
Wow, I like what you've done
with the place.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.865
Oh, right... Beaver.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.702
When I was your age
we just called it "down there."

13:49.078 --> 13:50.330
It was a simpler time.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.623
Look, I'm really sorry, all right?

13:52.999 --> 13:53.875
Kevin...

13:54.625 --> 13:57.587
even I know you're smart enough
to know you made a big mistake.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.799
So, look, why don't you join me
above ground,

14:01.883 --> 14:04.385
I'll make you lunch
and we can talk about this.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.304
Um...

14:06.387 --> 14:07.388
Okay.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.558
Wonderful. Thank you for listening to me.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.435
After you.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.897
Dad, you're not gonna kill me, are you?

14:17.065 --> 14:20.151
-[bell rings]
-[man] Ten seconds! Ten seconds to air!

14:20.860 --> 14:22.737
Now, when Hobo Jojo comes out,

14:22.820 --> 14:25.198
I want you to scream
like a bunch of Catholics

14:25.281 --> 14:26.824
watching the Pope take his hat off.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.076
Can you do that for me?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.161
[all] Yay!

14:30.745 --> 14:32.955
Mom, make sure you get up
when Jojo comes out.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.957
He loves a standing ovation.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.000
Okay, honey.

14:36.084 --> 14:40.713
And raise your hands up high to clap
so your tummy doesn't get blocked.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.966
God, I miss driving a cab.

14:44.050 --> 14:48.429
[railroad cop] It's time
for<i> Hobo Jojo's Cartoon Roundhouse!</i>

14:49.055 --> 14:51.349
-And here's Hobo Jojo!
-[cheering and applause]

14:51.432 --> 14:53.351
Work on the wig before it goes on my head.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.520
Hey, kids, how we doing?

14:55.603 --> 14:56.896
I'm Hobo Jojo!

14:56.979 --> 14:59.399
And for you kids watching on Channel 78...

14:59.482 --> 15:01.776
[speaks Spanish]

15:01.859 --> 15:02.819
[cheering]

15:05.405 --> 15:06.280
Eat your sandwich.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.032
Eat yours first.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.493
[sighs]
Kevin, I didn't poison your food, okay?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.703
That kind of thing
only happens up the block.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.208
Your mother told me I need to take
a new approach, and this is it.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.628
Just trying to help you get on
the right path towards a better tomorrow.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.547
Sound like my guidance counselor.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.758
Sounds like he knows what the fuck
he's talking about-- Sorry. Sorry.

15:26.843 --> 15:27.969
No upsetment.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.430
-Dad, you're sweating.
-I'm new to this!

15:30.847 --> 15:32.223
[inhales]

15:32.306 --> 15:34.100
[exhales]

15:34.183 --> 15:36.060
I just want to know how we ended up here.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.020
We weren't always like this, you and me.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.814
We were buddies when you were little.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.107
You weren't yelling at me then.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.650
You weren't getting arrested then.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.611
Come on, I'm not that bad, am I?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.947
Dad, it's hard to be around you sometimes.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.533
You're always screaming
at the top of your lungs,

15:50.616 --> 15:54.328
or you're all worked up
about some stupid<i> Colt Luger</i> episode.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.914
Well, why do they always have
to end it on a cliff-hanger, huh?

15:56.998 --> 15:58.624
Now I have to spend my whole summer

15:58.708 --> 16:01.252
worrying if Colt's gonna
get out of that submarine?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.212
Like I don't have
enough stress in my life?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.840
-Good to see you care about something.
-I care about you.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.176
I cut your sandwich in half, didn't I?

16:08.885 --> 16:09.760
Diagonally?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.137
That takes longer.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.222
I tell you, you don't know
how good you got it, buddy.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.183
Did you ever wonder
why we never see my father?

16:15.266 --> 16:16.559
Because he lives on a comet.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.687
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-That's what you told me when I was four.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.938
Oh, that's right, I did.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.483
Well... Well, here's the real reason.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.986
[sighs]

16:27.403 --> 16:28.863
How do I sum him up?

16:29.447 --> 16:30.948
I was in the fifth grade play.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.785
And my dad said he was actually going
to take off work to come and see me.

16:34.869 --> 16:35.870
So I was excited.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.585
Well... turned out
he just came down there to laugh at me.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.339
Which he did.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.675
Loudly and repetitively.

16:49.759 --> 16:53.304
So... [clears throat]
I started to forget my lines,

16:55.431 --> 16:56.974
then more people started laughing.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.645
He humiliated me.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.816
Afterwards,
he refused to give me a ride home

17:05.900 --> 17:09.987
because he said there was no room
in a DeSoto for sissies who act in plays.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.158
My mother, as always, was silent.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.121
Fucking guy drove behind me
the whole way home

17:19.205 --> 17:21.666
blowing the horn saying,
"Who wants a daughter?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.584
I thought I had a son!"

17:26.295 --> 17:27.171
He called me--

17:27.922 --> 17:30.091
He called me "Francine"
for the rest of the year.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.345
And I told myself right then and there...

17:35.888 --> 17:37.306
that I would never be like him.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.479
And I guess it really hurts me to think
that you look at me like--

17:43.563 --> 17:44.522
[snoring]

17:44.605 --> 17:46.315
-Oh, what the fuck? [pounds on table]
-Ah!

17:46.399 --> 17:47.900
Jesus Christ! What the hell you doing?

17:47.984 --> 17:50.444
I'm trying to open up to you,
you fucking asshole!

17:51.028 --> 17:53.281
Who wants to play the Coal Car Carnival?

17:53.364 --> 17:54.198
Oh! Pick me!

17:54.782 --> 17:55.783
Pick me! Hobo Jojo!

17:55.866 --> 17:59.036
Oh, Pick me! Hobo Jojo, me! Me!

17:59.120 --> 18:00.371
-I won!
-No, you didn't.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.124
Well, hello.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.835
Hobo Jojo picks you!

18:05.918 --> 18:07.003
Yay!

18:08.045 --> 18:10.423
My God, you could anchor a zeppelin
with this kid's melon.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.757
Definitely a C-section.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.011
[whispering]
Do you have any home movies of the birth?

18:15.636 --> 18:16.762
What's your name, squirt?

18:16.846 --> 18:18.764
Phillip Bonfiglio.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.141
Tell us a little about yourself.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.976
Will you be my father?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.102
That's my boy!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.395
And how about you, sunshine?

18:24.478 --> 18:27.064
Um, my name's Maureen Murphy.
And-- Hi, Daddy!

18:27.148 --> 18:28.524
<i>Look at me! I'm on TV!</i>

18:29.358 --> 18:30.359
<i>I'm nine years-old...</i>

18:30.443 --> 18:33.571
I'm hard on you because
I give a shit about you, Kevin!

18:33.654 --> 18:34.989
Yeah, right.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.407
I dare you to name one time,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.327
one time when I wasn't looking out
for what's best for you!

18:39.410 --> 18:40.620
What? What about--

18:40.703 --> 18:41.871
Besides the pool!

18:41.954 --> 18:46.417
Okay, kids, you're playing to win
this coal car full of toys and games

18:46.500 --> 18:48.127
courtesy of Laugh 'n' Choke Toys

18:48.210 --> 18:51.047
on Burned Down Lunatic Asylum Road
in Ryetown.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.966
Three rings around the bottlenecks
and you're winners.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.259
You go first, Phillip.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.927
Oh...

19:00.056 --> 19:01.140
Whoa.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.100
[sad clown music]

19:03.184 --> 19:04.226
[laughter]

19:04.310 --> 19:06.562
I'm sorry,
did you not understand the game?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.190
-[audience laughs]
-[Hobo Jojo] Your turn, Maureen.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.068
Remember what the carny said.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.029
"Flick your wrist. Aim high.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.114
The government's run by lizards."

19:19.909 --> 19:21.827
-That's one. Your turn, Phillip.
-[cheering]

19:21.911 --> 19:22.787
[girl] Good job.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.705
Ah!

19:24.789 --> 19:26.207
Whoa.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.875
And I thought they cured polio.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.085
[laughter]

19:29.168 --> 19:30.961

[cheering and applause]

19:36.384 --> 19:37.510
That's two!

19:38.052 --> 19:39.595
Well, look who's on a roll.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.180
That's my Maureen.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.933
That little broad
might actually win this thing.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.685
-What are we gonna do, Ray?
-We?

19:45.768 --> 19:48.145
I'm not the one who took
all the toys out of the boxes

19:48.229 --> 19:50.606
and gave them
to your second family for Hanukkah.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.816
I didn't do that either.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.526
Jim Jeffords did.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.403
Oh, boy.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.947
-[Phillip] Whoa.
-[laughter]

19:58.030 --> 20:00.074
I let you down, Maureen.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.034
It's okay. I've got this.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.246
Here you go, kid. One last shot.

20:05.788 --> 20:09.417
[slowed down clown music]

20:20.636 --> 20:23.222
No!

20:23.305 --> 20:25.766
Sorry, kids. Better luck next time.

20:25.850 --> 20:29.186
Well, let's see what our old friend
Sleepy Ramirez is up to.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.523
I'll give you a hint,
it's not an honest day's work.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.482
You cheated!

20:33.566 --> 20:36.152
[chuckles]
All right, little girl. Game's over.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.945
You kicked the box with your foot!

20:38.028 --> 20:39.655
You cheated me!

20:39.739 --> 20:41.657
Now, nobody likes a sore loser.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.534
Your train ride is over.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.619
Officer Ray has some parting gifts.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.037
Ah!

20:47.121 --> 20:49.331
I idolized you!

20:49.415 --> 20:52.710
-All right, it's the bum's rush for you!
-[screaming]

20:52.793 --> 20:53.794
It's me coal sack!

20:53.878 --> 20:55.504
You're gonna die!

20:56.130 --> 20:58.924
There's the Sicilian in him.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.470
Pittsburgh. I can't go to Pittsburgh.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.430
Oh, how'd I get myself into this?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.807
[tires screeching]

21:07.641 --> 21:10.811
[Kevin] On my ninth birthday you took me
to the beach and you left me there!

21:10.895 --> 21:12.354
And I got stung by a jellyfish!

21:12.438 --> 21:15.191
Oh, if you didn't whine so much,
I wouldn't tune you out.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.568
[Frank] I was getting a beer.
I saw where you were.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.487
Home sweet home.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.697
You never even wanted me
in the first place.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.656
That's not true!

21:22.740 --> 21:26.035
For the first five years of my life,
I thought my name was "The Accident"!

21:26.118 --> 21:28.621
That was a playful joke
between your mother and me!

21:28.704 --> 21:30.706
You wrote it on my birthday cake!

21:30.790 --> 21:32.082
We were having fun!

21:32.166 --> 21:35.169
Oh, Jesus Christ. What do you want?

21:35.503 --> 21:38.798
Dad, I really need to talk to you
about something.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.758
Not now, Bill, huh?
I'm in the middle of something.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.593
[sighs] This is really important.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.472
Can't you see that I'm having a
heart-to-heart with your fucking brother?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.474
You don't know
how good you've got it, buddy!

21:48.849 --> 21:50.893
I saw on the news
there was a guy in New Jersey

21:50.976 --> 21:52.645
who chopped his whole family up!

21:52.728 --> 21:55.189
Oh! So either you or an axe murderer?

21:55.272 --> 21:56.941
Those are my only two options?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.401
[Frank] Oh, that's the problem
with your whole generation...

21:59.485 --> 22:01.695
"Too many options, man!"

22:01.904 --> 22:04.031
I only had one option when I was a kid,

22:04.114 --> 22:06.116
do what my dad said or get killed.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.619
[Kevin] That's two options, man!

22:08.702 --> 22:10.996
[Frank] Oh, I thought you sucked at math!

22:11.080 --> 22:12.623
Jesus fucking Christ.

22:12.706 --> 22:16.252
Can't I have one kid who isn't
an absolute fucking disappointment?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.938
Ah!

22:36.021 --> 22:39.358
[Kevin] You don't care about me anyway.
You don't know anything about me!

22:39.441 --> 22:42.236
I know your brain doesn't start working
till two in the afternoon!

22:42.319 --> 22:45.531
Ha! Well, this brain
is getting an "A" in summer school!

22:45.614 --> 22:47.491
-You're getting an "A"?
-Of course I'm not!

22:47.575 --> 22:50.369
If you really knew me,
you'd know I could never get an "A"!

22:50.452 --> 22:52.079
Will you two knock it off?

22:52.162 --> 22:54.206
Oh, hey, Sue. Back so soon?

22:54.582 --> 22:56.417
Kevin, sit down.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.378
Frank, I can't even look at you.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.213
You promised to be gentle.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.424
I treated him like a carton of eggs, Sue.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.718
And surprise, surprise,
he's still an asshole.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.680
Well, as I'm sure you saw,
we had a terrible day too.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.891
Hobo Jojo cheated us,

23:12.266 --> 23:15.394
but at least you saw me
wave to you on TV, right, Daddy?

23:15.769 --> 23:18.355
Hobo what-oh?
What the hell is she talking about?

23:18.439 --> 23:19.773
You didn't watch me?

23:20.482 --> 23:21.901
But you promised.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.320
Ah, Christ, Princess, I...

23:25.821 --> 23:28.741
-Was it that important?
-It was everything!

23:29.617 --> 23:32.453
Great job, Frank.
Why do I even try around here?

23:32.536 --> 23:34.580
[to herself] This goddamn family.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.081
[Sue] Is it me or is it them?

23:36.165 --> 23:37.166
[Sue] Jesus Christ.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.709
I guess you don't know
anything about Maureen either.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.294
-Shut up!
-Kevin's right.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.837
You don't care about me,

23:41.921 --> 23:44.298
and it's gonna be even worse
when the stupid baby comes.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.342
Princess, haven't you learned by now?

23:46.425 --> 23:47.843
Kevin's never right.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.471
And Bill said you and Mom
aren't my real parents.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.807
That you guys found me living
in a junkyard with a family of rats.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.100
That little bastard.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.062
Your mother's "gentle approach experiment"
is over.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.480
The patient died.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.023
Kevin, you're grounded.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.566
Maureen, be a man.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.026
Goomer, go home!

24:04.902 --> 24:06.946
Bill, I have a bone to pick with you!

24:07.029 --> 24:09.281
[tense music climaxes]

24:09.365 --> 24:10.616
[door opens]

24:12.117 --> 24:13.077
[Frank] Sue, get down here.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.037
What is it?

24:17.498 --> 24:18.707
"Dear Mom and Dad.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.293
[Bill]<i> By the time you find this note,</i>

24:21.377 --> 24:24.129
<i>I will be long gone</i>
<i>because I'm running away.</i>

24:24.546 --> 24:26.966
<i>Dad, I'm sure you won't care too much</i>

24:27.049 --> 24:29.426
<i>being that I'm</i>
<i>such a big disappointment to you</i>

24:29.927 --> 24:31.845
<i>and I'm always bothering you</i>
<i>with my problems.</i>

24:32.846 --> 24:34.556
<i>And I know you think I'm a pussy.</i>

24:35.099 --> 24:37.142
<i>My reasons for saying this are</i>

24:37.226 --> 24:39.228
<i>A, I heard you say it to Mom.</i>

24:40.646 --> 24:44.441
<i>In conclusion, I'm sure</i>
<i>you will all be better off without me.</i>

24:44.525 --> 24:47.695
<i>Mom, I'll remember to brush my teeth.</i>

24:48.946 --> 24:53.784
<i>Maureen, even though I'll be gone forever,</i>
<i>you still can't have my room.</i>

24:53.867 --> 24:56.870
[Bill]
<i>And Kevin, you were doing something.</i>

24:57.621 --> 24:59.999
Sincerely yours, Bill."

25:05.170 --> 25:06.213
Here we go.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.924
[moans]

25:09.008 --> 25:11.844
It's just you and me, dickweed.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.976
[poignant jazz music]

25:50.758 --> 25:53.218
-[mechanical whirring]
-[gunshot]
