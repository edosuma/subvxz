00:00.578 --> 00:02.302
This was a hallway!

00:02.304 --> 00:05.106
Hallway, hallway, hallway,

00:05.107 --> 00:06.968
my room, fireplace!

00:06.970 --> 00:08.976
This is where I kept my formal
crowns, my casual crowns,

00:08.977 --> 00:10.311
my "just for fun" crowns.

00:10.312 --> 00:13.414
Yes, this is definitely
where my castle was!

00:13.415 --> 00:14.482
Okay, are we done?

00:14.483 --> 00:15.850
Because I either need to find your army

00:15.851 --> 00:17.452
or I need to go and find another one

00:17.453 --> 00:18.820
so I can go and save Isabella.

00:18.821 --> 00:21.055
Oh, relax, chisel chin. You'll get my army.

00:21.056 --> 00:22.990
I just have to figure out where they went,

00:22.991 --> 00:24.725
and if they took my castle with them.

00:24.726 --> 00:26.194
Strangest thing...

00:26.195 --> 00:28.963
I-I know I've never seen
this village before,

00:28.964 --> 00:32.667
and yet somehow it seems
oddly familiar to me.

00:32.668 --> 00:36.204
I say, peasant, I have a question,

00:36.205 --> 00:38.439
and please don't get all star-struck

00:38.440 --> 00:39.640
because I'm speaking to you directly.

00:39.641 --> 00:42.143
No way! It's you!

00:42.144 --> 00:43.311
I know. You're flustered.

00:43.312 --> 00:46.147
Guys, look, it's Sir Galavant,
the famous knight!

00:46.148 --> 00:47.782
[All murmuring]

00:47.783 --> 00:49.317
Hello. Hi.

00:49.318 --> 00:50.918
What a thrill!

00:50.919 --> 00:54.055
Is there perhaps someone else
here you recognize?

00:54.056 --> 00:56.357
Maybe...Your king?

00:56.358 --> 00:58.325
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:59.595 --> 01:02.396
Greetings, lowly ones!
It is I, King Richard!

01:02.397 --> 01:04.699
I have returned! Good to see you again.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.000
So, I have a question.

01:06.001 --> 01:08.769
What the hell happened to my castle?!

01:08.770 --> 01:11.205
Yeah, we, uh... We sort of tore it down

01:11.206 --> 01:13.674
to make homes and shops for everybody.

01:13.675 --> 01:15.843
Oh, well, that would explain
the familiarity.

01:15.844 --> 01:16.944
You knocked it down?!

01:16.945 --> 01:18.913
I demand you rebuild it immediately,

01:18.914 --> 01:21.449
or I will have every one of you
drawn and quartered and...

01:21.450 --> 01:22.583
What's going on?

01:22.584 --> 01:25.052
W-why are they not scurrying
to do my bidding?

01:25.053 --> 01:27.488
Oh, well, here's the thing.

01:27.489 --> 01:30.725
When you left us to go in search
of the Jewel of Valencia,

01:30.726 --> 01:33.861
we didn't hear anything
for a really long time.

01:33.862 --> 01:35.696
All right, that's fair. That's on me.

01:35.697 --> 01:36.998
I should've sent a pigeon or two.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.933
Yeah, but while you were away,

01:38.934 --> 01:41.202
we realized that a king is only a king

01:41.203 --> 01:42.603
if the people say he is.

01:42.604 --> 01:44.272
- [Chuckles]
- And if they don't,

01:44.273 --> 01:47.375
well, he's just a man with a metal hat

01:47.376 --> 01:48.843
who's only in charge

01:48.844 --> 01:51.112
because his father wore
a metal hat before him,

01:51.113 --> 01:52.847
which is pretty crazy
if you think about it.

01:52.848 --> 01:54.549
[Laughter]

01:54.550 --> 01:56.617
You know, he's... He's got a point.

01:56.618 --> 01:57.818
It <i> is</i> pretty crazy.

01:57.819 --> 02:01.355
Hmm. So, then we came together
and asked ourselves,

02:01.356 --> 02:03.891
"what if there was a different
way of doing things?

02:03.892 --> 02:04.959
A better way?

02:04.960 --> 02:06.761
A fairer way?"

02:06.762 --> 02:08.162

when a queen loses her beauty sleep?

17:45.855 --> 17:48.724
[All murmuring]

17:48.725 --> 17:50.525
I will join, King Richard!

17:53.897 --> 17:55.998
Well, there we go. That's a good start.

17:55.999 --> 17:58.801
Right. Who's next?

17:58.802 --> 18:00.302
[Man coughing]

18:00.303 --> 18:02.738
Anyone at all?

18:02.739 --> 18:04.973
[Coughing continues] [Murmuring]

18:04.974 --> 18:07.042
Well, this is certainly uncomfortable.

18:07.043 --> 18:08.309
Pbht.

18:14.584 --> 18:15.584
Aah!

18:15.585 --> 18:16.985
[Blows]

18:16.986 --> 18:18.554
You did this to me!

18:18.555 --> 18:20.756
- Aah!
- [Door opens]

18:20.757 --> 18:23.158
Shh! Are you trying to get me killed?!

18:23.159 --> 18:25.694
I saw his head! It was right there!

18:25.695 --> 18:27.329
And it was giving me that look.

18:27.330 --> 18:31.266
My King, I think I know what's going on.

18:31.267 --> 18:32.968
Richard was your friend.

18:32.969 --> 18:36.839
And, yes, you took his throne
and his queen and his kingdom

18:36.840 --> 18:38.640
and his favorite shirts
and his weekly bridge game...

18:38.641 --> 18:39.842
Oh, get on with it!

18:39.843 --> 18:43.979
But the fact you feel bad
about it is a good thing.

18:43.980 --> 18:47.916
It means you're actually,
surprisingly, human.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.218
Maybe I do feel guilty.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.256
I do miss the old bastard.

18:54.257 --> 18:57.393
Look, there was one other thing

18:57.394 --> 18:58.993
my mother used to do for my dreams.

19:02.699 --> 19:05.200
♪ Good dreams only ♪

19:05.201 --> 19:07.603
♪ Good dreams only ♪

19:07.604 --> 19:11.039
♪ Bad dreams out of his head ♪

19:11.040 --> 19:13.675
♪ It's time tonight ♪

19:13.676 --> 19:16.211
♪ For dreams of fright ♪

19:16.212 --> 19:20.381
♪ To leave this little boy's bed ♪

19:24.521 --> 19:26.321
There's one more in there.

19:26.322 --> 19:28.022
Oh.

19:34.964 --> 19:37.199
So, what now?

19:37.200 --> 19:39.802
I'm off to Hortensia to rescue Isabella,

19:39.803 --> 19:42.070
recruit some soldiers along the way,

19:42.071 --> 19:45.073
and after that, march to
Valencia to reclaim her kingdom.

19:45.074 --> 19:47.743
Well, I have a surprise.

19:47.744 --> 19:50.379
Your old pal Rick's gonna join you!

19:50.380 --> 19:52.080
What? No. No, no, no, no.

19:52.081 --> 19:54.550
You said you were gonna stay
here and figure out who you are.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.518
And I did. I realized I'm the guy

19:56.519 --> 19:58.020
who's going to help you rescue Isabella.

19:58.021 --> 19:59.655
Even though, technically,

19:59.656 --> 20:01.390
I'm the guy who started the whole disaster.

20:01.391 --> 20:03.025
So, what do you say?

20:03.026 --> 20:04.660
Why not?

20:04.661 --> 20:06.995
Awesome! You, me, Roberta.

20:06.996 --> 20:08.330
Oh, this is Roberta, by the way.

20:08.331 --> 20:10.332
Do you remember her
from... from the election?

20:10.333 --> 20:11.667
She stood up, pledged to join me.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.901
Watch this.

20:12.902 --> 20:15.103
Oh, Roberta?

20:15.104 --> 20:16.872
Yes, My King?

20:16.873 --> 20:18.173
She calls me "king."

20:18.174 --> 20:19.174
Oh, my God.

20:19.175 --> 20:21.009
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!

20:21.010 --> 20:21.944
No, it's not.

20:21.945 --> 20:23.378
Well, we should probably go.

20:23.379 --> 20:25.581
I stole these horses and just
set fire to the Rec Center.

20:25.582 --> 20:28.049
Dismantle my castle, will you?

20:28.918 --> 20:30.952
[Cheers and applause]

20:35.625 --> 20:36.892
Princess Isabella,

20:36.893 --> 20:39.795
isn't there something
you might want to say?

20:39.796 --> 20:42.331
[Sighs] Good news, everyone!

20:42.332 --> 20:44.299
I've set a date for my wedding.

20:44.300 --> 20:48.470
It's in six weeks, and you're all invited!

20:48.471 --> 20:51.306
[Cheers and applause]

20:51.307 --> 20:53.475
[Fanfare]

20:53.476 --> 20:55.711
Does something seem different
about Princess Isabella?

20:55.712 --> 20:59.248
Who cares? She's getting married!

20:59.249 --> 21:00.716
Boom! Boom!

21:00.717 --> 21:03.518
[Cheers and applause continue]
