WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.049
MAN: I'm not sure
what smells worse,

00:06.093 --> 00:08.138
the water or the trash.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.097
WOMAN: At this point,
I'd say it's us.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.535
How did I let you
talk me into this?

00:13.578 --> 00:15.058
Blame Yale.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.973
They're the ones
who find applicants

00:17.017 --> 00:20.063
with community service hours
to be highly desirable.

00:20.107 --> 00:24.241
Unbelievable. I'm all-state
in water polo and lacrosse,

00:24.285 --> 00:26.287
and my ancestors came over
on the Mayflower.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.593
It doesn't get more
well-rounded than that.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.120
WOMAN: What is that?

00:33.163 --> 00:35.948
A boot

00:41.171 --> 00:42.868
That's gonna stain.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.012
Oh, screw this.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.927
Yale can wait-list me.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.711
♪

01:28.479 --> 01:30.699
That's so cool.Thank you.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.831
McGEE: Ah, look
who finally made it.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.095
Where have the two of you been?

01:35.138 --> 01:37.706
Oh, another sunrise
sketching session.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.317
Have you guys ever taken in dawn
at the, uh, Navy Yard?

01:40.361 --> 01:42.058
It is quite peaceful.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.278
That's the fifth time this week.Yeah, that street art case

01:44.321 --> 01:46.149
really inspired us
to get back into drawing.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.543
So while the two of you
have been playing Picasso,

01:48.586 --> 01:51.589
McGee and I have been
working our asses off.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.808
Oh, really?

01:52.851 --> 01:56.203
Ha! Diligent research,
I'm sure. Hmm.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.074
All right, well,
let's see what you two drew.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.684
We were rushed.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.383
It's-it's not
the best, but...

02:02.426 --> 02:03.732
McGEE:
Oh, wow.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.212
What, are you kidding?
These are amazing.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.996
Jimmy, I had no idea
you could draw like this, man.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.389
TORRES:
What?

02:08.432 --> 02:09.825
Want to see talent?

02:09.868 --> 02:11.000
Check this out.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.222
JIMMY: Is that
your painting

02:15.265 --> 02:16.919
from our guys' night out?That's right.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.181
It's amazing, isn't it?

02:18.225 --> 02:20.183
The, uh, police evidence bag
really adds

02:20.227 --> 02:22.359
a level of realism to it.Texture.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.969
Nothing more real
than a dead sailor.

02:24.013 --> 02:24.970
Grab your gear.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.712
See you.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.845
Hey, let me see.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.934
Oh.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.936
Twins paint
that, McGee?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.677
Not exactly, boss.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.810
Gibbs cut me. He cut me deep.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.943
Everyone's a critic. Come on.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.601
Waterway Volunteers
is a nonprofit

02:46.644 --> 02:49.038
that clears trash
from rivers and oceans.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.083
Saving sea turtles and dolphins

02:51.127 --> 02:54.304
from, you know,
plastic straws and all that.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.827
Straws are bad?

02:55.871 --> 02:57.394
Plastic straws are poison
to sea life.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.222
Here, check out this video.No, not the video.

02:59.266 --> 03:02.094
I can't watch that thing again.You're not the one

03:02.138 --> 03:04.140
with a synthetic rod
constricting your airway.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.663
All right, Veronica,

03:05.707 --> 03:07.361
Archie, let's stay on track.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.492
What time
did you guys

03:08.536 --> 03:09.754
arrive on the scene?

03:09.798 --> 03:11.582
6:00 a.m.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.105
Did you guys see anything
out of the ordinary?

03:13.149 --> 03:14.542
You mean other
than the dead body?

03:16.021 --> 03:17.980
Actually, hold up.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.461
Did you want us
to see something?

03:20.504 --> 03:23.115
What?

03:23.159 --> 03:27.337
Maybe if we tell you
what you want to hear,

03:27.381 --> 03:30.166
NCIS could write a couple
of letters of commendation

03:30.210 --> 03:31.994
to the Yale Admissions Board
on our behalf?

03:33.125 --> 03:35.606
Okay. Yale?

03:35.650 --> 03:36.955
Yeah.Keep dreaming, buddy.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.132
GIBBS:
What do you got, Palmer?

03:40.176 --> 03:41.612
Well, other than
the broken neck,

03:41.656 --> 03:43.005
there's no outward
signs of trauma.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.398
Agent Torres.You have time of death?

03:44.441 --> 03:45.790
Condition of the body
points to him

03:45.834 --> 03:47.357
being in the water
for some time.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.837
I'd say close to a week.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.057
I wasn't able to confirm his
identity using fingerprints.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.755
Yeah, the guppies
got to him first.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.539
That is the circle of life,
gentlemen.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.935
I mean that in the most

03:59.978 --> 04:01.197
respectful way possible,
by the way.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.590
We found his military
I.D. in his pocket,

04:02.633 --> 04:04.896
and according to the
name tag on his uniform,

04:04.940 --> 04:08.204
our victim is Senior
Chief Richard Granger,

04:08.248 --> 04:10.728
assigned to the
Defense Logistics Agency.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.688
Ah, Jethro, I gave the body
a quick examination.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.993
While there was no

04:15.037 --> 04:16.908
outward appearance of trauma...

04:16.952 --> 04:17.909
Neck is broken.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.476
Already got that, Duck.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.652
Oh.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.306
BISHOP:
Hey, Gibbs.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.177
We have a big problem.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.528
I just got off the phone with
the Defense Logistics Agency,

04:27.571 --> 04:30.270
where Senior Chief
Granger worked.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.793
Any reason they didn't
report him UA?

04:31.836 --> 04:33.403
That's the thing.

04:33.447 --> 04:37.886
Uh, the person I spoke to
was Senior Chief Granger.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.235
He's alive.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.672
Then who is this?

04:54.163 --> 04:56.208
BISHOP:
Do you recognize him?

04:56.252 --> 04:57.471
My God.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.082
No. Who is he?That's what we
want to know.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.345
How'd he get your military I.D.
and your uniform?

05:02.389 --> 05:03.781
My apartment was
broken into last week,

05:03.825 --> 05:05.348
and some of my
gear was stolen.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.655
I filed a police report,
but nothing came of it.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.657
Any idea why
someone would want

05:09.700 --> 05:11.049
to impersonate you,
Chief Granger?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.356
Not a clue.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.489
I'm a personnel clerk
in a logistics depot.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.360
Not exactly a sexy job,

05:17.404 --> 05:19.144
unless you're into color-coded
organizational charts.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.671
Hold on.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.760
Do I need protection
or something?

05:25.803 --> 05:27.631
A guy pretending
to be me was killed.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.546
Does that mean
I'm being targeted?

05:29.590 --> 05:31.200
Who said he was killed?

05:31.243 --> 05:33.811
Not many people end up in the
Potomac from natural causes.

05:33.855 --> 05:34.812
Mm.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.258
Oh.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.391
I am so sorry, Doctor. I...

05:48.435 --> 05:50.480
I meant to clear
all my stuff out of here

05:50.524 --> 05:52.569
now that you're back here
at NCIS full-time.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.092
Dr. Palmer.
I know, I know.

05:54.136 --> 05:58.793
An organized workspace
is an efficient workspace.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.274
Yes, it is, but I was about to
commend you on this drawing.

06:02.318 --> 06:05.190
Oh, really?Yes, amazing detail.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.367
I particularly like
the way you've drawn

06:07.410 --> 06:10.892
the superior and inferior
vena cava.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.155
It seems you are as skillful
with a pencil

06:13.198 --> 06:15.157
as you are with a scalpel.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.465
Hopefully, I don't get the two
confused. That could get messy.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.295
Right.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.167
It's good to have you
back here, Doctor.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.908
Things weren't the same
around here without you.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.127
Yeah, it's a welcome change
from my book tour.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.609
Hey, Ducky. You rang?Yeah, our examination

06:32.653 --> 06:34.742
was correct--
the cause of death

06:34.785 --> 06:36.874
was a fracture
to the C3 vertebra.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.920
But it wasn't from
the fall into the water.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.443
The victim was dead beforehand.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.531
So not a suicide?

06:41.575 --> 06:44.055
Not unless he broke his own neck

06:44.099 --> 06:46.188
and then somehow managed
to roll himself into the water.

06:46.231 --> 06:50.279
Broke his own neck and rolled
himself into the water?

06:50.322 --> 06:52.499
: You know, I don't
have a story for that one.

06:54.152 --> 06:57.808
Oh, that's never
happened before.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.202
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.204
Oh, so am I.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.161
Permission to proceed?

07:03.205 --> 07:04.641
Granted.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.513
All right, during
our examination,

07:06.556 --> 07:08.776
we found a metal rod
in the victim's leg

07:08.819 --> 07:10.342
from a previous
surgery.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.909
I ran the serial number
in the system,

07:11.953 --> 07:13.476
came up with a hit.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.870
So who's our victim?TORRES: Meet our victim

07:15.913 --> 07:18.916
and Navy impersonator,
Wesley Moore. He's 31.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.875
He's a freelance
cyber systems engineer.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.312
Unmarried, no kids,
no next of kin,

07:23.355 --> 07:25.140
which explains why
he was missing for a week

07:25.183 --> 07:27.838
and no one reported it.Criminal record?

07:27.882 --> 07:30.624
Other than a few late student
loan payments, this guy's clean.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.364
Yeah, Moore had a brief stint
in the military

07:32.408 --> 07:34.279
eight years ago
before washing out

07:34.323 --> 07:36.499
of Marine Officer Candidate
School after a leg injury.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.109
What about his movements
the night he was killed?

07:38.153 --> 07:39.894
We tracked Moore's steps
with the I.D. he stole

07:39.937 --> 07:41.330
from Senior Chief
Granger.

07:41.373 --> 07:42.810
He used it
to gain access

07:42.853 --> 07:44.638
to the Defense Logistics Agency.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.291
And security cameras at the gate

07:46.335 --> 07:48.076
captured his vehicle
entering the premises

07:48.119 --> 07:50.774
at 2100 hours last Wednesday.

07:50.818 --> 07:51.949
Yeah, he exited
two hours later.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.081
After that,
Moore fell off the grid.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.648
BOLO's already out on the car.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.520
Why'd he sneak into the DLA?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.609
To hack into the DoD's
classified message traffic.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.481
I'm working on
what he accessed,

08:01.524 --> 08:03.134
but sensitive data on
troops' movements overseas

08:03.178 --> 08:05.093
might have been compromised.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.530
And we got a serious
security breach on our hands.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.923
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.533
KASIE:
Hi, Gibbs. Do you have a minute?

08:10.577 --> 08:11.578
Yeah, be right down.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.536
Find out what Moore was after.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.806
Water currents?

08:22.850 --> 08:25.200
Yeah, you'd think a person
who builds boats

08:25.243 --> 08:27.811
would find tide shifts
more fascinating.

08:27.855 --> 08:28.986
A lead would be
fascinating.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.684
KASIE:
This is the lead.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.555
What, did you think
I invited you down here

08:32.599 --> 08:35.645
for some riveting nonverbal
conversation

08:36.777 --> 08:39.127
Okay, uh, moving on.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.738
So, I have been analyzing
the coastal tide patterns

08:41.782 --> 08:43.697
for the past six days,

08:43.740 --> 08:47.222
working backwards from where
Wesley Moore's body washed up

08:47.265 --> 08:50.007
to determine where his body
first entered the water.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.966
Narrowed down the search grid.Hey!

08:52.009 --> 08:54.446
Now we're on
the same wavelength.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.144
Okay.

08:56.187 --> 09:00.888
And not a fan of puns.
Okay, um, good to know.

09:00.931 --> 09:03.630
Okay, if my calculations
are correct,

09:03.673 --> 09:05.153
Moore's body was dumped

09:05.196 --> 09:08.939
somewhere within a two-mile
stretch of shoreline near...

09:08.983 --> 09:10.419
North Old Town.

09:10.462 --> 09:14.902
Uh, Gibbs,
I've got something.

09:14.945 --> 09:18.166
Wesley Moore's e-mail
and phone records indicate

09:18.209 --> 09:21.430
he received several messages
from Captain Alicia Voit,

09:21.473 --> 09:24.694
a Marine stationed
in Kabul, Afghanistan.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.348
And in their last
correspondence,

09:26.391 --> 09:28.785
two weeks ago,
Voit e-mailed Moore

09:28.829 --> 09:31.788
the names of
12 dead Marines.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.834
Please tell me this is
not another hit list.
No.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.618
Not so much.
All of those Marines died

09:35.662 --> 09:38.142
prior to Voit's message
being sent.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.709
Why would she
message a list

09:39.753 --> 09:41.711
of deceased Marines'
names to Moore?

09:41.755 --> 09:42.930
Contact the base
in Kabul.

09:42.973 --> 09:46.586
Get Voit on MTAC.Uh, Gibbs,

09:46.629 --> 09:48.152
that's impossible.

09:48.196 --> 09:51.155
Captain Alicia Voit was killed
in action six days ago,

09:51.199 --> 09:53.375
same day as
our victim,

09:53.418 --> 09:54.768
Wesley Moore.

09:57.074 --> 09:59.729
BISHOP:
Captain Alicia Voit, 30,

09:59.773 --> 10:01.557
a highly decorated
Marine

10:01.601 --> 10:04.604
who was serving her third tour
in Afghanistan.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.170
TORRES: She was killed
six days ago

10:06.214 --> 10:08.433
after her convoy was ambushed
by Taliban insurgents

10:08.477 --> 10:09.652
just outside of Kabul.

10:09.696 --> 10:10.653
McGEE:
The attack was led

10:10.697 --> 10:11.959
by Aazar Atwa,

10:12.002 --> 10:14.178
an extremist responsible
for multiple

10:14.222 --> 10:16.093
U.S. casualties
over the past year.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.748
Captain Voit's body was sent
to Dover Air Force Base.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.011
Her remains are set
to be released tomorrow.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.839
What's her connection
to Wesley Moore?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.406
They met at Marine Officer
Candidate School

10:24.449 --> 10:26.016
eight years ago.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.931
Moore washed out of the program,
but the two remained close.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.150
They were definitely
more than that.

10:30.673 --> 10:33.110
I mean, by their e-mails
and social media posts,

10:33.154 --> 10:34.677
yeah, they were
definitely involved.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.418
Um, I read those letters.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.681
There was nothing
romantic in them.Bishop.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.683
Single guy, single girl.
Do the math.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.685
News flash, Torres.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.948
Uh, men and women can have
platonic relationships.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.907
Why?

10:46.950 --> 10:50.258
McGee, what about the intel
Moore hacked from the DLA?

10:50.301 --> 10:52.695
He accessed the non-redacted
after-action reports

10:52.739 --> 10:54.436
on the 12 K.I.A. Marines

10:54.479 --> 10:57.569
Captain Voit listed
in her last e-mail to him.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.747
All were victims of Aazar Atwa's
previous attacks.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.705
GIBBS: Torres, focus
on Kasie's search grid.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.707
Find out where Moore's body
was dumped.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.404
McGee, Bishop,
get your go-bags.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.364
GoOh, where are we going?

11:09.407 --> 11:10.800
Afghanistan.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.465
MAN:
Present arms!

11:23.508 --> 11:25.249
♪

11:37.609 --> 11:39.829
Order arms!

11:43.224 --> 11:45.661
Right or left, face!

11:45.705 --> 11:48.882
Forward march!

11:56.541 --> 11:58.500
You must be Agent Gibbs.

11:58.543 --> 12:01.285
HQ said to expect you.
Colonel Park.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.766
You're the Marine escort
assigned to Captain Voit?

12:03.810 --> 12:07.248
Affirmative. I am tasked
with her final transit home.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.903
The captain's remains should be
released within the hour.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.733
Something wrong?

12:13.776 --> 12:15.386
Colonels aren't usually
assigned these details.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.648
A Marine goes
where he's needed,

12:16.692 --> 12:18.085
Agent Gibbs.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.565
What's your destination?

12:20.609 --> 12:23.394
Strathmere, New Jersey.
Captain Voit's hometown.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.571
Our transport will be departing
at 1000 hours.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.922
Colonel, I'm afraid
there's going to be a delay.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.576
Excuse me?Captain Voit

12:31.620 --> 12:33.840
is now part of an active
murder investigation.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.193
Murder investigation?

12:39.236 --> 12:41.804
I wasn't informed of that.Her remains are
to be brought

12:41.848 --> 12:44.415
to NCIS until we have
more answers.

12:45.982 --> 12:48.550
I understand your...

12:48.593 --> 12:51.335
your situation, Agent Gibbs,

12:51.379 --> 12:53.120
but I cannot allow that.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.471
It's not a request, Colonel.

12:56.514 --> 12:59.691
It's my duty
to get the captain home

12:59.735 --> 13:01.911
to be laid to rest in two days.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.522
And I'll do everything I can
to ensure that happens.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.003
With all due respect,
that's not good enough for me.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.310
Colonel, there's a possibility
that Captain Voit's death

13:09.353 --> 13:11.138
is connected
to another murder case.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.270
We owe it to
both victims

13:13.314 --> 13:14.837
to find out the truth.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.148
That is something
we do agree on.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.892
All right.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.155
But I'm going with you.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.810
Don't expect me
to leave the captain's side.

13:30.853 --> 13:31.854
Understood.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.123
KASIE:
What kind of mud is this?

13:40.167 --> 13:42.125
It feels like quicksand.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.954
Are you sure this is
the right search grid?

13:44.998 --> 13:47.391
Oh, yeah, positive. Moore's body
had to have entered the water,

13:47.435 --> 13:49.480
like, around here.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.832
Oh, my... oh, my...
oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:52.875 --> 13:54.659
Oh, my God, did you see
the size of that fly?

13:54.703 --> 13:57.445
It was, like, prehistoric.

13:57.488 --> 14:01.057
Uh, consider this your crash
course on field agent work.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
Yeah, okay, well, getting
covered in grime and, like,

14:02.929 --> 14:06.454
eaten by flies isn't exactly
the high-octane experience

14:06.497 --> 14:08.717
you promised.The day's young, sister.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.371
Fine, but if I see
one snake, I am...

14:10.414 --> 14:12.329
I'm out of here.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.722
Wait, snake? What are you...
Wait, what do you mean, snake?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.028
What are you talking
about, snakes?

14:15.071 --> 14:17.073
Oh, yeah. They thrive
in swampy ecosystems.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.121
All right, okay.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.210
Well, uh... stay on it.

14:23.253 --> 14:26.648
Get 'er done. I'm gonna...

14:26.691 --> 14:28.650
I'll be right back.Yeah, that's usually
what someone says

14:28.693 --> 14:30.826
right before they're killed
in a horror movie,

14:30.870 --> 14:32.915
but yeah, I'm sure
this is totally different.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.223
I love my job,
I love my job, I love my job,

14:36.266 --> 14:37.746
I love my job. Oof!

14:37.789 --> 14:40.009
Hey, man.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.576
Can I have a word?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.709
Hey, it's about time.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.973
Been out here on
my own all morning.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.108
What, are you waiting
for an invitation?

14:52.152 --> 14:53.762
Start pulling your weight.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.156
Okay, take it down
a notch, buddy. NCIS.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.682
Sorry about that. I, uh...

15:00.725 --> 15:02.379
I thought you were
one of our volunteers.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.773
He's over an hour
and a half late.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.210
Are you with, uh,
Waterway Volunteers?

15:07.254 --> 15:09.473
Uh, yeah. That's right.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.822
I spent my
morning covering

15:10.866 --> 15:12.824
a half-mile stretch that way.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.957
Why

15:15.001 --> 15:17.742
KASIE:
Nick! Got something!

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
What kind of car did you say
Wesley Moore had?

15:27.013 --> 15:29.015
It's a silver Ford Focus.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.199
Not bad, Kasie.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.983
Thanks.

15:48.208 --> 15:51.646
Why would a decorated Marine
like Captain Voit get mixed up

15:51.689 --> 15:53.691
with somebody like Wesley Moore?

15:53.735 --> 15:55.519
Well, they're not
that different, Leon.

15:55.563 --> 15:59.132
Both were orphaned as teenagers,
were children of public servants

15:59.175 --> 16:02.178
and shared this pure desire
to serve their country.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.137
Are we talking
about the same Moore?

16:04.180 --> 16:06.400
The one who impersonated
a Navy sailor,

16:06.443 --> 16:08.576
who broke onto a secure
military facility

16:08.619 --> 16:11.405
and hacked into
a confidential DoD server,

16:11.448 --> 16:13.711
putting thousands
of U.S. troops at risk?

16:13.755 --> 16:15.496
Hey, I didn't say
he was perfect.

16:15.539 --> 16:16.714
Well, there's an understatement.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.281
But I don't believe that Moore

16:18.325 --> 16:20.892
accessed those files
for nefarious reasons.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.982
He-he did it to help Voit.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.200
Help how?

16:24.244 --> 16:25.593
Voit was looking for answers.

16:25.636 --> 16:26.724
SLOANE: Right.
On the 12 dead Marines.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.030
She knew that Moore

16:28.074 --> 16:30.337
could hack into DoD's system

16:30.380 --> 16:32.382
and cut through
the governmental red tape.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.080
Yeah, in a highly illegal way.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.951
Which suggests a
sense of urgency.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.824
Now, Captain Voit
reached out to Moore

16:39.868 --> 16:42.697
instead of going through
her chain of command. Why?

16:42.740 --> 16:44.220
'Cause Voit didn't know
who to trust.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.917
Exactly.You think their deaths
are connected?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.180
100%.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.833
They both died the same day--

16:48.877 --> 16:50.922
one in D.C., one in Afghanistan.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.837
Coordinated attacks, yeah?

16:52.881 --> 16:56.015
And the key to why has to do
with Afghanistan.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.495
And this is usually
the time you tell me

16:58.539 --> 17:00.889
that you've already sent
a team en route.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.412
Sent McGee and Bishop
this morning.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.240
They should be
at Camp Russell any minute.

17:05.850 --> 17:09.332
Don't ask me. I-I don't know
how he does it, either.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.905
[indistinct announcement
over speaker]

17:23.955 --> 17:25.653
The CG's been briefed
on the situation.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.090
He said to assist
in any way possible.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.526
When can we speak with him?Well, he's finishing up

17:29.570 --> 17:31.659
with a new Marine detachment
that arrived today.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.313
Thought, uh, U.S. forces
were supposed to be

17:33.356 --> 17:35.576
withdrawing from Afghanistan.That was the plan.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.099
But with the Taliban's
attacks increasing

17:37.143 --> 17:38.492
and their grip on
Kabul strengthening,

17:38.535 --> 17:39.971
the withdrawal's
been put on hold.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.843
So you're familiar
with Aazar Atwa?

17:41.886 --> 17:43.758
Yes, ma'am. You'd be
hard-pressed to find

17:43.801 --> 17:45.238
a Marine here
who isn't.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.240
We've lost a lot of good people
because of him.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.851
Captain Voit was just
the most recent casualty.

17:49.894 --> 17:53.115
You could say Atwa is public
enemy number one around here.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.030
Agents Bishop
and McGee.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.989
I'm General Braxton,
CG of Camp Russell.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.426
Appreciate
the assistance, General.Of course.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.254
Captain Voit was one of our own.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.299
We want her to have justice.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.823
And it looks like you both have
arrived just in time to see it.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.086
How's that?

18:07.129 --> 18:08.783
I received word from our patrol

18:08.826 --> 18:10.611
in the northeast sector
who were conducting a raid

18:10.654 --> 18:12.700
of a suspected Taliban
safe house.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.963
Did they find the weapons cache?Better.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.444
They found Aazar Atwa.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.098
Wh

18:19.141 --> 18:21.491
En route back to our base,
under heavy guard.

18:21.535 --> 18:25.104
You have questions
about Captain Voit's death?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.801
You'll soon get the chance
to question her killer

18:26.844 --> 18:27.802
face-to-face.

18:43.905 --> 18:47.909
Are you sure there's nothing
I can get for you, Colonel?

18:47.952 --> 18:50.564
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

18:50.607 --> 18:54.133
Do you mind me asking what's,
uh... what's in the bag?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.961
Contains Captain Voit's
personal effects.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.703
JIMMY: Ah. Yeah, I couldn't
help but notice that...

18:59.747 --> 19:02.184
you won't let it out of
your sight, even for a second.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.230
Per DoD regulations,

19:04.273 --> 19:06.536
a fallen service member's
personal effects

19:06.580 --> 19:09.365
shall remain in the escort's
possession at all times

19:09.409 --> 19:11.802
until directly delivered
to the next of kin.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.370
JIMMY:
Mm-hmm.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.504
You know, I can't imagine a more
difficult detail for a Marine

19:17.547 --> 19:21.986
to be assigned than escorting
a fallen brother or sister home.

19:24.119 --> 19:27.209
I suspect your job
is not much different, Doctor.

19:27.253 --> 19:31.953
Yeah. It's a, uh...
it's a struggle at times.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.955
But I take comfort
in knowing that we're helping

19:33.998 --> 19:35.348
to provide with some closure.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.438
My comfort is inconsequential.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.267
Those that make
the ultimate sacrifice

19:41.310 --> 19:42.746
for this country

19:42.790 --> 19:44.661
deserve to be brought home
with honor.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.535
Duck, what do we know?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.537
DUCKY: An examination
of Captain Voit

19:50.580 --> 19:52.800
could not be performed since

19:52.843 --> 19:55.542
she has already been
processed for burial.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.588
But the records from
Kabul and Dover

19:58.632 --> 20:00.286
are very thorough.

20:00.329 --> 20:03.332
The captain was first struck
with two bullets to the chest.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.334
Uh, despite
her grave condition,

20:05.378 --> 20:07.815
she managed to take
out four insurgents

20:07.858 --> 20:11.210
before the third and
fatal blow to the head.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.341
She never gave up.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.474
That's a Marine.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.434
Okay. We are done here.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.436
Colonel?I complied with
your request,

20:20.480 --> 20:23.483
Agent Gibbs. I allowed you
to bring Captain Voit here,

20:23.526 --> 20:25.441
against my better judgment.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.791
As your doctors
have just pointed out,

20:27.835 --> 20:29.706
she is of no further use to you.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.231
Release her remains,
and allow me

20:32.274 --> 20:33.841
to finish my mission.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.625
Evidence is still
being processed.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.148
Our investigation isn't over.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.194
But my cooperation is.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.849
W-We'll give you two a moment.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.160
What's this?A memo,

20:49.204 --> 20:50.814
from the Secretary of Defense,

20:50.858 --> 20:52.642
ensuring your
full cooperation.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.905
Explain to me how the captain
can be involved

20:54.949 --> 20:57.299
in a murder in the States
when she was in Afghanistan.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.214
This makes no sense.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.911
I'm doing my job!

21:02.652 --> 21:04.741
I thought you were
a Marine, Gibbs.

21:04.785 --> 21:08.441
If you were,
you'd have her back.

21:08.484 --> 21:12.532
Her burial is in 36 hours.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.316
I will get her there.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.554
Hey, Kasie.

21:34.597 --> 21:35.946
How you doing?

21:35.990 --> 21:38.514
On a scale of one to ten?

21:38.558 --> 21:39.646
We're in the negatives.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.822
Whoa.Yeah, tell me about it.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.564
I tried being a field agent,
and it bit me.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.000
Look at me.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.784
It's like a
connect-the-dots sheet.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.875
I'm not really laughing.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.964
Okay, well, since work is
one of the only things

21:54.008 --> 21:56.097
distracting me from
the urge to itch,

21:56.140 --> 21:57.968
I'm just gonna
jump right in.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.884
I didn't find any usable
prints in Wesley Moore's car,

22:00.928 --> 22:03.887
but I hit the jackpot
with the rear body damage.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.802
Check this out.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.804
This is a surveillance image

22:07.848 --> 22:10.024
of Moore leaving the DLA

22:10.067 --> 22:11.460
on the night that he was killed.
You notice anything?

22:15.159 --> 22:17.901
Taillight and fender are intact.Yeah.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.339
Meaning this vehicle was damaged
later that night,

22:20.382 --> 22:21.992
before he was killed.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.038
So, if he was being tailed,
the killer must have, uh,

22:24.081 --> 22:26.519
caused a fender bender
to get Moore out of the car.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.609
So I pulled a second
paint profile

22:29.652 --> 22:31.611
of the killer's car
in question. Whoo!

22:31.654 --> 22:34.396
Try saying that
five times fast.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.704
And it is a lacquer-based red
with a metallic base coat.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.662
Okay, hundreds of cars
match that.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.969
Actually, since it's
one of the most used

22:42.012 --> 22:43.884
paint types in production,

22:43.927 --> 22:46.365
the number's more
in the thousands.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.888
How do you suggest
we narrow down our suspects?

22:47.931 --> 22:50.325
Well, with, uh,
persistence, diligence,

22:50.369 --> 22:51.935
and our combined
computer skills.

22:51.979 --> 22:55.678
Combined
What am I, Bishop or McGee?

22:55.722 --> 22:57.027
No, I'm more of, like,

22:57.071 --> 22:58.594
a physical specimen,
man, you know?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.117
You know, punching,
intimidating,

23:00.161 --> 23:01.945
that's more my thing.Mm, okay.

23:01.989 --> 23:05.253
I trekked through a swamp
for you, Nicholas.

23:05.296 --> 23:08.256
So, if you bail on me now,
you're just gonna find

23:08.299 --> 23:11.346
a slithering copperhead snake
in your desk drawer.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.522
Ooh, or in your bed.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.743
Or worse.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.270
Is it just me,

23:22.313 --> 23:24.577
or does this feel...Too easy?

23:24.620 --> 23:25.926
No, it's not just you.

23:32.889 --> 23:36.197
He looks pretty carefree
for a captured terrorist.

23:38.765 --> 23:39.983
You gonna translate?

23:40.027 --> 23:43.160
No. I don't need to,

23:43.204 --> 23:45.119
'cause he can understand us
just fine.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.947
Isn't that right?

23:46.990 --> 23:48.949
Yes, I can.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.996
Sorry, does something amuse you?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.564
This. All of it.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.653
Well, let me show you
what I don't find funny.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.133
Alicia Voit,

23:59.176 --> 24:02.049
Max Wiezman,

24:02.092 --> 24:04.486
Anna Gutierrez,

24:04.530 --> 24:07.489
Tyson Eccles, Nolan Takahamo.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.969
Should I continue?

24:09.012 --> 24:10.753
Those names mean nothing to me.Well, they should.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.494
They're the names of some
of the Marines you killed.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.715
Again...

24:17.456 --> 24:18.674
...they mean nothing to me.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.502
So you don't deny it?

24:20.546 --> 24:22.112
Why deny what I'm proud of?

24:22.156 --> 24:26.203
Well, if you're so proud,
tell us about her.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.292
She was part of the convoy
you hit last week.

24:28.336 --> 24:29.903
I remember.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.296
The sky was so clear that day.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.995
We could see their vehicle
from miles away,

24:35.038 --> 24:36.910
unfortunately for her.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.738
Wasn't that easy.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.522
Captain Voit killed
four of your men

24:40.566 --> 24:41.958
before you could finish her off.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.699
Guess you underestimated her.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.921
Are we going to continue
this game,

24:47.964 --> 24:50.619
or do you want to know
the truth about my attacks?

24:50.663 --> 24:53.187
Tell us.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.974
Only if I get something
in return.

24:59.628 --> 25:00.803
My freedom.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.501
How original.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.416
You're a terrorist
who killed 13 U.S. Marines.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.896
Hope you enjoy
those shackles,

25:06.940 --> 25:08.507
'cause you're gonna
be living in a cell

25:08.550 --> 25:10.770
for the rest of your life.
Let's go.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.558
I had help,

25:16.602 --> 25:18.212
from an American.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.130
Now do I have your attention?

25:30.833 --> 25:33.619
You were working
with an American?

25:34.881 --> 25:35.882
Prove it.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.580
My freedom for a traitor

25:38.624 --> 25:41.148
who's been betraying
your country.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.542
Fair trade,

25:43.585 --> 25:45.805
don't you think?

25:48.459 --> 25:50.026
Atwa's out of his damn mind.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.463
The U.S. government will not do
a deal with a known terrorist.

25:52.507 --> 25:55.205
I understand, Director,
but Atwa claims

25:55.249 --> 25:57.077
he's been working with
an American on the inside.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.339
Atwa's smart.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.906
He'll say whatever
we want to hear

25:59.949 --> 26:01.690
if it means securing
his release.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.475
We have no guarantee
what he gives us is the truth.

26:04.519 --> 26:07.130
Yes, and normally, Sloane,
I would agree with you,

26:07.174 --> 26:10.307
but not this time. I-I really
don't think he's bluffing.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.744
Bishop, what do you know?

26:11.787 --> 26:14.137
Look, I-I've dealt with
insurgents like Atwa before.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.662
He-he's not agitated,
nervous or volatile.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.838
He is, in fact, assured,

26:18.881 --> 26:21.275
like someone who knows
that they have the advantage.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.059
12 dead Marines.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.539
What about them?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.236
Transports were hit
by the Taliban.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.543
Convoy routes are changed
at the last minute.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.066
BISHOP:
Yeah.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.111
Someone had to be
directly relaying

26:31.154 --> 26:32.591
their movements to Atwa.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.897
Well, even if that's true,
it doesn't erase the fact

26:34.941 --> 26:37.944
that Atwa's caused
the deaths of multiple troops.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.554
He wants to talk, Leon.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.339
Well, then get him to talk,
but he's not getting a deal.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.385
Is that clear?

26:44.428 --> 26:46.779
Uh, yes, yes, Director.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.650
Gibbs?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.434
His friends don't need
to know that.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.746
Colonel, it's late.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.662
Got a room waiting for you
at the BOQ.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.925
That won't be necessary.
I'm doing fine.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.710
DoD escorts are permitted

27:04.753 --> 27:08.148
to leave
service members' remains

27:08.191 --> 27:09.932
at a secure location.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.195
I know what the
regulations say.

27:12.239 --> 27:15.416
I just don't feel right
leaving the captain alone.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.853
Yeah, figured you were gonna
say something like that.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.904
What are you doing?

27:26.732 --> 27:28.603
I'm getting you a cot.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.475
I told you, I'm fine.Yeah, yeah, I know,
you're fine.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.216
I got it, okay.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.870
Got to sleep somewhere.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.785
Hey, take it
or leave it.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.918
Your call.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.755
I owe you an apology

27:49.798 --> 27:51.670
for what I said earlier, Gibbs.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.674
It was wrong to question
your service.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.373
I've been there, Colonel.

27:59.416 --> 28:03.943
It is not easy

28:03.986 --> 28:06.554
getting assigned
an escort detail.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.427
No.

28:10.471 --> 28:11.994
No, it's not.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.999
It's even harder
if you volunteered for it.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.873
Was it that obvious?

28:25.268 --> 28:27.140
How'd you know Captain Voit?

28:27.183 --> 28:30.752
I was the one who recruited her.

28:30.796 --> 28:35.365
Met Voit ten years ago.

28:35.409 --> 28:38.020
She had just lost both of
her parents the winter before.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.066
She was putting herself
through college.

28:40.109 --> 28:43.504
She was a real hard worker,
and good head on her shoulders.

28:43.547 --> 28:46.028
Marine material.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.335
I can always tell within a...

28:48.378 --> 28:49.902
within a minute
of meeting somebody

28:49.945 --> 28:53.253
whether they have what it takes.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.471
Voit did.

28:56.473 --> 28:59.650
I was the one

28:59.694 --> 29:02.479
who swore her in,

29:02.523 --> 29:07.006
so I should be the one
to bring her home,

29:07.049 --> 29:11.053
just like I did
for all the other

29:11.097 --> 29:13.969
fallen Marines
that I've recruited.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.494
How many?

29:17.538 --> 29:20.062
One is too many.

29:20.106 --> 29:23.892
You're not responsible
for their deaths, Colonel.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.810
You've lost people, right?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.812
As a Marine,

29:30.856 --> 29:32.858
as an agent?

29:34.947 --> 29:36.949
Did you not feel responsible?

29:42.302 --> 29:45.871
They were just...
just kids who...

29:45.914 --> 29:49.091
joined the military
under my guidance.

29:51.354 --> 29:54.575
I'll carry their deaths with me

29:54.618 --> 29:56.620
every day.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.017
I owe them that much.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.285
Where are we going?Transferring you.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.113
To Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

30:11.157 --> 30:13.594
Hope you like humidity
and solitary.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.726
Is that supposed to frighten me?

30:15.770 --> 30:18.033
No, but putting you in a cell
with Gibbs may.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.339
BISHOP:
Last chance, Atwa.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.949
Tell us the American
you're working with.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.473
Not until I'm released.May want to rethink that.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.127
I can't imagine your fellow
insurgents would look favorably

30:25.171 --> 30:27.216
on you working with us.

30:27.260 --> 30:30.872
The fate of an American
isn't their concern.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.874
They know I would
never betray them.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.615
Well, unless we spread word
around town

30:34.658 --> 30:36.530
that you gave them up
for your freedom.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.053
We can be very convincing.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.621
They'll see you as a
traitor and a liability.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.884
You won't last one minute
outside those gates,

30:42.928 --> 30:44.451
not without our protection.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.844
So, if you enjoy
breathing,

30:45.887 --> 30:47.323
I suggest you start talking

30:47.367 --> 30:48.890
and tell us who
your American contact is.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.720
Very well.

30:52.763 --> 30:56.419
12 months ago, I began receiving
intelligence from a source.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.266
What the hell happened, McGee?

31:17.310 --> 31:18.833
Sniper fire from the mountains.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.182
No one had eyes on the shooter.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.836
Did Atwa give you anything?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.838
He was about to
when the gunfire started.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.796
Well, someone wanted
to shut him up.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.928
Which means we got
a mole on our hands

31:26.972 --> 31:27.929
with advanced sniper training.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.583
That's perfect.

31:29.626 --> 31:31.933
The details of Atwa's transfer
never left Camp Russell.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.240
So it had to be
someone in-house.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.285
Bishop's going through
all the personnel files now.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.592
Listen to me, McGee,
you find him!

31:50.865 --> 31:53.999
I'm not sure I can stare
at this screen much longer.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.262
This glare is making me squint,

31:56.305 --> 31:59.091
and this face doesn't do
wrinkles.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.831
Come on, team.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.442
Sure, we pulled
an all-nighter

32:02.485 --> 32:04.226
combing traffic-cam footage,
and we're no closer

32:04.270 --> 32:07.621
to finding our suspect, but
we're in this together, right?

32:07.664 --> 32:10.189
Friends helping friends.Jimmy,

32:10.232 --> 32:11.494
stop talking.

32:11.538 --> 32:14.280
Hey, Jimmy.

32:14.323 --> 32:15.934
When'd you get here?

32:15.977 --> 32:18.023
Oh, boy.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.764
The top o' the morning to you.

32:20.808 --> 32:24.333
I bring much-needed
sustenance.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.945
Two black coffees.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.121
There we are.
And, uh,

32:29.164 --> 32:32.254
one large double mocha

32:32.298 --> 32:34.648
frozen blend
with whipping cream

32:34.691 --> 32:39.000
and chocolate chips,
and a drizzle of caramel.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.524
Yes.
Mm.

32:41.568 --> 32:44.832
Now, that hits the spot.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.834
You can eat that
and still look like that?

32:48.444 --> 32:50.577
Man, life's not fair.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.622
Jimmy, uh, you disgust me.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.408
Hey... got something.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.498
Red truck matching
our description.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.891
Ooh, complete with
front bumper damage.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.197
Where was this picture taken?

33:02.241 --> 33:04.025
Traffic cam,
ten miles from where

33:04.069 --> 33:05.766
Moore's car was found

33:05.809 --> 33:07.246
on the night he was killed.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.987
Who's the truck registered to?

33:09.030 --> 33:10.989
KASIE:
Xavier Blackburn.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.860
Civilian from Falls Church.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.036
Hey, I ran into this guy
at the marsh.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.691
He said he was with
Waterway Volunteers.

33:17.734 --> 33:20.520
Uh, there's no Xavier Blackburn
listed on their crew roster.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.261
Then what was he doing
at the marsh?

33:22.304 --> 33:24.263
Doing what all guilty people do.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.918
Covering his tracks.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.055
So, let me see
if I got this right.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.057
Volunteering my time
makes me a murder suspect?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.929
Talk about "no good deed."

33:38.973 --> 33:43.325
Okay, so no one at
Waterway Volunteers

33:43.369 --> 33:44.587
has ever heard of you.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.763
I'm new. They must have lost
my paperwork.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.330
We didn't.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.463
"Xavier Blackburn, 33."

33:50.506 --> 33:52.639
Spent six years
as a contractor

33:52.682 --> 33:54.380
for a private military
firm in Arlington.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.946
Until you were fired

33:55.990 --> 33:58.906
because of behavioral issues.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.473
"Increasingly
violent outbursts

34:00.516 --> 34:03.258
and blatant disregard
for protocol."

34:03.302 --> 34:06.087
I had an occasional disagreement

34:06.131 --> 34:08.307
with a few short-sighted
superiors.

34:08.350 --> 34:09.786
I'm sure you can relate.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.920
Nice truck.

34:12.963 --> 34:16.358
At least it was.
We... we tracked it down

34:16.402 --> 34:17.751
to a body shop near your house.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.274
And guess what.

34:19.318 --> 34:22.712
The paint on your bumper was
a match to Wesley Moore's car.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.803
Moore stole U.S. intelligence.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.370
Did you know that?

34:28.414 --> 34:30.546
He was a risk
to national security

34:30.590 --> 34:32.026
and needed to be stopped.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.680
Moore was investigating
an American

34:33.723 --> 34:35.421
who was aiding the Taliban.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.730
He wasn't the traitor, genius.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.646
No, you're wrong.
He told me Moore was dangerous.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.257
He?

34:45.300 --> 34:47.781
He said that if I neutralized
the threat,

34:47.824 --> 34:50.523
he would reinstate me,
and I would get my job back.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.438
Who gave you the order?

34:55.180 --> 34:57.660
The patrol will leave
at 0500 hours.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.227
Jennings, you're driving lead.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.621
Dunne and Falconio,
you're on the flank.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.753
Kinneman.
Yeah.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.321
Keep your eyes peeled
for insurgent activity.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.323
Rumors of Atwa's death
are no doubt

35:08.367 --> 35:09.455
circulating throughout the city,

35:09.498 --> 35:11.631
so retribution is expected.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.676
BISHOP:
You're right about that.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.331
I'm sorry, Agents,
but this is a secure briefing.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.767
It's too late
for that, General.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.204
Your patrol route's
already been compromised,

35:19.247 --> 35:20.857
and not by us.

35:20.901 --> 35:21.902
What are you talking about?

35:21.945 --> 35:24.252
Go ahead, tell 'em.

35:24.296 --> 35:27.342
I don't know what you mean.

35:27.386 --> 35:28.387
All right,
I'll give you a hint.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.736
One word, begins
with the letter "T."

35:29.779 --> 35:31.085
Rhymes with "reason."

35:31.129 --> 35:34.262
Well, someone better start
making sense real soon.

35:34.306 --> 35:37.004
Kinneman here was leaking
your transport routes

35:37.047 --> 35:38.223
to Aazar Atwa.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.879
That's a lie.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.230
BISHOP:
Really? All right.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.232
Does this guy look familiar?

35:47.275 --> 35:49.190
Your former coworker
and accomplice,

35:49.234 --> 35:50.887
Xavier Blackburn?

35:50.931 --> 35:52.193
He's in NCIS custody.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.326
Gave you up in record time.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.066
Do... do not
listen to them.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.198
This is a setup.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.679
Kinneman's a military
contractor.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.029
Why would he be helping
the Taliban?

36:02.072 --> 36:03.117
BISHOP:
Simple economics.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.684
U.S. forces pull out of Kabul,

36:04.727 --> 36:07.600
his lucrative defense
contracts disappear.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.645
If enemy attacks
increase in the area,

36:09.689 --> 36:11.212
U.S. military strengthens
their presence,

36:11.256 --> 36:12.648
securing your funding.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.042
So you started passing intel
to Atwa

36:15.085 --> 36:17.131
on certain convoys to attack.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.785
McGEE: But Captain Voit
started digging around,

36:18.828 --> 36:20.265
and you had to
put an end to it.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.267
Then you had Atwa
strike Voit's convoy.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.530
Then you shot Atwa before
he could give you up.

36:24.573 --> 36:25.922
McGEE:
Easy target for someone

36:25.966 --> 36:28.360
with advanced sniper training,
such as yourself.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.057
BISHOP:
Come on, Kinneman,

36:30.100 --> 36:32.842
these guys deserve to know.

36:32.886 --> 36:35.236
How much were those
Marines' lives worth, huh?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.282
Five million

36:40.937 --> 36:44.593
It wasn't about money.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.029
Are you kidding me?!If the military withdraws

36:46.073 --> 36:48.597
and the Taliban takes control
of this area again,

36:48.641 --> 36:51.165
then what were the last
15 years of fighting even for?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.254
McGEE: Hey, 14 people are
dead because of you.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.517
You're as much a terrorist
as anyone like Atwa.

36:55.561 --> 36:56.562
Put your hands
behind your back.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.147
Hey, Doctor, I need
your signature

37:17.191 --> 37:19.411
on this body transfer.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.153
What's going on?I am properly

37:23.197 --> 37:26.200
displaying your artwork.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.639
All these should be
shown and admired.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.598
I can't believe
that you did this.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.382
I am touched.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.037
Oh, consider it
a parting gift.

37:38.778 --> 37:41.041
Parting gift?
You going somewhere?

37:41.084 --> 37:42.869
Indeed I am.

37:42.912 --> 37:46.438
You can call it
a globetrotting adventure.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.397
But you just got back.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.532
You have proven yourself
more than capable

37:53.575 --> 37:56.099
in the last year, Dr. Palmer.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.971
I have no doubt that
you'll continue

37:58.014 --> 38:00.365
to hold the fort while I'm gone.

38:00.408 --> 38:04.325
Sure, but you will
be back, right?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.718
Of course.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.850
And when I return
in the new year,

38:07.894 --> 38:10.766
I shall have many more
stories to relate.

38:10.810 --> 38:12.551
Well, that's great.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.422
What's the first stop
on your vacation gonna be?

38:14.466 --> 38:16.076
Something, uh, exotic?

38:16.119 --> 38:19.166
Maybe the pyramids,
Great Wall of China?

38:19.209 --> 38:20.210
The Serengeti?

38:20.254 --> 38:22.604
Mount Rushmore.

38:22.648 --> 38:26.304
South Dakota.
In the middle of winter.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.566
Mm.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.352
You are one in a million,
Doctor.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.788
True.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.232
Thank you for your
cooperation, Colonel.

38:42.276 --> 38:45.323
You know, this escort
mission has top priority.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.194
I should be the one
thanking you, Gibbs.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.456
Those responsible
for Captain Voit's death

38:48.500 --> 38:50.458
have been brought
to justice.

38:50.502 --> 38:53.243
I only wish that could happen
for every fallen service member.

38:53.287 --> 38:56.159
What time is the
captain's funeral?

38:56.203 --> 38:58.684
0900 hours tomorrow.

38:58.727 --> 39:01.426
Strathmere, New Jersey.

39:01.469 --> 39:03.515
That's about a five-hour drive.
Looking for a navigator?

39:05.430 --> 39:07.388
You have your go

39:07.432 --> 39:10.217
Already packed.
It's in the car.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.915
Company would be nice.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.048
I know Voit would
appreciate having

39:15.091 --> 39:16.571
another Marine there
to see her off.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.878
My honor.

39:18.921 --> 39:22.838
You would have really
liked her, Gibbs.

39:22.882 --> 39:25.450
She was as determined
as they come.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.800
Never backed down from a fight.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.019
♪

39:57.395 --> 39:59.092
Shall we?

39:59.135 --> 40:00.615
Yeah.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.239
Rest easy, Marine.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.764
We got the watch.
