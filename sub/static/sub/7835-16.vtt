00:28.153 --> 00:29.570
All right, family.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.365
Who can guess what's
different about dinner tonight?

00:32.573 --> 00:34.283
Same old garbage.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.329
This guy's always on!

00:38.414 --> 00:40.581
Oh, you two.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.918
We're eating genetically
modified vegetables.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.795
Look how big they are!

00:46.672 --> 00:48.214
This corn doesn't look so big.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.966
That's baby corn.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.467
What?

00:51.552 --> 00:54.887
American corporations should
stop playing God with nature.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.806
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.685
They're all grown by the vegetable
division of Union Carbide.

01:00.978 --> 01:04.313
Mom, my potato is eating a carrot!

01:07.818 --> 01:11.446
That's it. From now on, I'm
growing all our vegetables myself.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.498
Go away! Go away!

01:25.794 --> 01:26.919
What you doing, Mom?

01:27.004 --> 01:30.131
I've tried heckling them.
I've tried jeckling them.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.342
It's time I made myself a scarecrow.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.612
Go away! Go away!

01:52.696 --> 01:53.738
"... in God, the Father Almighty

01:53.822 --> 01:54.781
"Creator of heaven and earth... "

01:54.865 --> 01:55.907
Shoo! Shoo!

02:00.496 --> 02:03.039
"Heaven and earth... "
Where were we? Now I'm lost.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.174
Yeah, I did it! Marge is in the house!

02:13.425 --> 02:15.760
I will be soon. Because
it needs some cleaning!

02:20.557 --> 02:21.682
Huh?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.270
I'll regroup at Red Lobster.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.200
You ain't pretty no more!

02:42.913 --> 02:47.208
Look. I've made some friends.
Now, go do my bidding!

02:47.751 --> 02:49.293
Uh... Whatever it may be.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.137
So, Lisa says by killing their
enemy I became the alpha crow.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.390
I got to admit. I'm
kind of nervous here.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.017
We haven't seen Barney
since they enveloped him.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.604
I'm sure he'll turn up. Look,
here's one of his buttons.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.233
All right, that's it. Get them out
of here! This ain't no crow bar!

03:12.317 --> 03:17.780
This is a crow bar! See? They got
the little stools and everything.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.951
That's Russell Crow, Cameron Crow,

03:22.035 --> 03:25.121
Crow Diddley, Hume
Crow-nyn, Gregory Peck.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.041
Homer, I'm very uncomfortable having

03:29.126 --> 03:31.377
a gang of crows in our bedroom.

03:31.461 --> 03:36.799
It's a murder, honey. A group
of crows is called a murder.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.218
I'm sleeping on the couch.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.981
Drop it in! Don't cram it in!
Forget it! I'll do it myself.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.360
Aw, look. Maggie wants to fly, too.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.241
Hey! Cut it out! Put her down!

04:12.336 --> 04:15.004
Thank God you're okay.

04:15.547 --> 04:19.507
Okay, that was not cool. We need
to lay down some ground rules.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.970
We'll get to that! Right now,
I think we need some time apart!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.475
All right, that's it!
Shoo, you stupid crows!

04:27.684 --> 04:29.477
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

04:34.191 --> 04:35.942
That is not a worm!

04:43.367 --> 04:48.204
Ow! Ow! I hate getting stitches
in my eyes! Stupid crows!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.414
Don't be mad at the crows, Homer.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.916
They weren't trying to blind you.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.961
They were just trying to drink
your sweet, sweet eye juices.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.254
Mmm. Fascinating. Say, Doctor,

04:57.339 --> 05:00.257
can you do something
about my searing pain?

05:00.342 --> 05:04.178
Well, there is a medication.
Although, it's a little controversial.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.471
Does it go in the butt?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.807
I'm talking about medicinal marijuana.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.476
Prescription pot. Texas THC.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.478
Look, man, I don't do drugs!

05:12.562 --> 05:15.731
Homer, for your eyes,
the best tonic is chronic.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.693
You're not afraid, are you?

05:19.194 --> 05:21.696
I had a bad experience with drugs.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.031
It was that golden weekend between

05:24.116 --> 05:26.492
summer school and regular school.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.661
Hey, Homer, want to
smoke some marijuana?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.413
They say it's a gateway drug.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.625
Well, well. If it isn't
the Doobie Brothers.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.794
Uh-oh. Crotch the weed, man.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.548
Smell any drugs, Sergeant Scraps?

05:49.891 --> 05:54.854
For me, the '60s ended that day in 1978.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.231
But, Homer, you can't let
a single bad experience

05:57.315 --> 05:58.566
scare you away from drugs.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.861
But isn't marijuana, or "dope," illegal?

06:01.945 --> 06:04.030
Only for those who enjoy it.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.699
Medical use of marijuana
is legal in this state.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.118
We'll also provide you
with a prescription bong.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.997
Do you want the wizard or the skull?

06:13.123 --> 06:16.584
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind

06:16.668 --> 06:19.920
Incense and peppermints,
the color of time

06:22.090 --> 06:25.217
Okay, let's see. "Toke as needed.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.638
"Caution, objects may appear more
edible than they actually are. "

06:35.854 --> 06:42.818
Incense, peppermints

06:44.112 --> 06:47.031
What's that billowing down the stairs?

06:47.115 --> 06:49.408
It's smoke!

06:49.493 --> 06:53.162
It smells like the art teacher's office.

06:53.455 --> 06:57.625
Smoke on the water

06:57.709 --> 07:01.295
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

07:01.379 --> 07:02.379
Uh-oh.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.966
Da-da-da-da-da!

07:06.426 --> 07:09.720
They burned down the gambling house

07:10.263 --> 07:13.516
It died with an awful sound

07:15.018 --> 07:18.646
I am hungry for a candy bar

07:18.730 --> 07:21.690
I think I'll eat a Mounds

07:24.903 --> 07:26.987
Homer! You're doing drugs!

07:28.281 --> 07:31.450
And now I'm guilty of
possession! I could go to prison

07:31.535 --> 07:33.994
unless I testify against you.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.331
Marge, it's making my eyes
better. And it's legal.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.291
I could walk up to the president

07:39.376 --> 07:41.836
and blow smoke in his
stupid, monkey face!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.922
And he'd just have to
sit there grooving on it.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.925
Color sky Havana lake

07:48.969 --> 07:52.513
Color sky rose carmethene

07:53.056 --> 07:56.559
Alizarian crimson

07:57.269 --> 08:08.070
Wear your love like heaven

08:09.990 --> 08:11.073
Hello?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.701
Marge, I just realized

08:13.785 --> 08:19.248
I am the "ow" in the word "now. "

08:19.833 --> 08:21.458
And if you tell anyone...

08:21.585 --> 08:23.210
Honey, I like it when you call.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.921
But we just talked five minutes ago.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.674
Hang on, I've got call waiting. Hello?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.510
Hey, it's me. I've got
Marge on the other line

08:31.595 --> 08:34.179
and she is totally bumming me out.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.229
Dad, I thought you
didn't like her saxophone.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.065
I didn't. But now,
Daddy's special medicine,

08:45.150 --> 08:48.485
which you must never use
because it will ruin your life,

08:48.570 --> 08:53.699
lets Daddy see and hear magical
things you will never experience.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.326
Ever!

08:55.410 --> 08:58.954
Dad, it's 1:00 a. m.
and I'm out of saliva!

09:08.506 --> 09:11.550
Wow. That saxophone
would make a great pipe.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.347
Hi-diddily-hey,
Homer!

09:16.431 --> 09:17.389
Oh, my God!

09:17.474 --> 09:19.808
This dude does the best Flanders!

09:19.893 --> 09:22.144
You got the mustache and the "diddily!"

09:22.229 --> 09:23.771
Okay, now do Wiggum!

09:25.232 --> 09:27.524
Homer, it's me. Ned.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.486
Right. The God dude.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.863
Hey, I got a question for you.

09:32.948 --> 09:36.075
"Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot

09:36.159 --> 09:38.118
"that he himself could not eat it?"

09:39.496 --> 09:43.499
Well, sir, of course he
could. But then again,

09:43.583 --> 09:45.960
wow, as melon-scratchers
go, that's a honey-doodle.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.878
Now you know what I've
been going through.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.546
Well, luckily, I've
got a book right here

09:49.631 --> 09:51.507
that's jam-packed with answers.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.883
Mmm.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.928
Oh, man, this is long.
Could you read it to me?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.556
I guess that could be arranged.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.019
"The grace of the Lord Jesus
be with God's people. The end. "

10:04.938 --> 10:07.439
Wow. Wow.

10:07.524 --> 10:11.068
God does so much for me and he
doesn't ask anything in return.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.237
Well, I know he's wishing
you'd sign his petition

10:13.321 --> 10:15.614
to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.491
Done and done! Now do Wiggum!

10:17.575 --> 10:20.703
Well, okay. I guess it
would go something like this.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.914
All right, Simpson,
you're under arrest, see?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.207
I said Wiggum!

10:26.293 --> 10:32.006
"And so, potential investors, I hope
you don't think our IPO is an IPU."

10:33.216 --> 10:36.677
Then I hold my nose thusly.
What do you think, Smithers?

10:36.761 --> 10:37.928
Bit of a downer, sir.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.805
Well, I hope the investors like it.

10:39.889 --> 10:43.017
I have to raise $60 million
or we're out of business!

10:43.101 --> 10:44.184
Why is that, sir?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.478
I told you, I pissed it away!

10:46.563 --> 10:48.564
Don't make that face.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.566
Yes, that's the one.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.902
Smithers, I need someone
who laughs at all my jokes.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.238
You know, honest feedback.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.325
Oops! I thought this was the can, man.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.871
Well, you're a happy Homer.
What's your name, young man?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.581
You just said it!

11:08.752 --> 11:10.669
Well, if you like that, listen to this.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.880
Working hard or hardly working?

11:15.550 --> 11:19.636
Smithers, you could learn a thing
or two from this braying moron.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.265
Young man, I'm making you
my executive vice president.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.769
Sir, I believe that position
was informally promised to me.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.564
No, Smithers. I would've said
anything to get your stem cells.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.733
Now, welcome aboard!

11:33.318 --> 11:36.028
You're covered with a very fine fuzz.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.909
"Hardly working. "

11:43.036 --> 11:44.578
Where did you get that suit?

11:44.662 --> 11:47.790
Whoa, whoa! One question
at a time! Yes, you?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.875
Look, I'm really starting to worry.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.629
There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere.
We're all out of paper clips.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.006
And the curtains smell like doob.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.801
Oh, yeah? Well, I got news for you!

11:59.135 --> 12:03.097
I just got promoted, and it's
all thanks to "Yes-I-cannabis!"

12:04.307 --> 12:05.599
We have a kitchen?

12:10.480 --> 12:13.399
Now, where are those three
chandelier-hangers I hired?

12:14.526 --> 12:17.653
You mutton heads! This is why
we can never hold down a job.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.993
Look at Shemp. He is so high!

12:25.620 --> 12:28.831
Hey, "Shemp" is "hemp"
spelled backwards.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.626
And "Otto" is "Otto" backwards!

12:34.462 --> 12:35.754
Now, I'm scared.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.714
Homie, I don't mean
to nag, but what does

12:37.799 --> 12:40.175
this have to do with healing your eyes?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.053
As soon as I graduate,
I am so out of here!

12:43.138 --> 12:46.223
This just in. The Marijuana
Re-Criminalization Initiative

12:46.307 --> 12:49.059
took another step forward
today as supporters collected

12:49.144 --> 12:51.812
the final signatures required
to place it on the ballot

12:51.896 --> 12:53.522
for next Tuesday's election.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.816
We got to get out and
stop that initiative!

12:55.900 --> 12:58.610
Marge, I'm gonna need
10,000 veggie burritos!

12:58.695 --> 12:59.945
No guac in mine.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.280
Good night, Homer.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.116
Dude, your mom is hot.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.243
Don't encroach on our roach!
Don't encroach on our roach!

13:06.536 --> 13:10.831
You've got to run like
an antelope out of control

13:16.379 --> 13:18.297
Okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.508
I smell marijuana smoke.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.343
That better be medicinal!

13:23.428 --> 13:26.221
If Phish don't see a prescription
slip, we are out of here!

13:26.306 --> 13:28.474
We can wait all night, people.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.683
Here we go.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.063
Whoa! This guy is seriously ill.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.818
My doctor never told me that.
I had to hear it from Phish.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.821
A one, a-two, a
you-know-what-to-do

13:43.072 --> 13:45.908
Run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run, run

13:46.075 --> 13:50.370
You've got to run like
an antelope out of control

14:02.175 --> 14:07.179
Thank you. And now, a
man who's a real pothead.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.515
I'm sorry. "Pothead. "

14:09.599 --> 14:11.266
Homer Simpson!

14:13.520 --> 14:17.564
Good afternoon. I want to thank
you all for coming down here,

14:17.649 --> 14:19.858
taking time off from your jobs.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.109
Jobs? What? Jobs...

14:21.194 --> 14:24.738
Because we need to keep
medical marijuana legal!

14:26.157 --> 14:27.866
Whether you suffer from glaucoma

14:27.951 --> 14:30.160
or you just rented The Matrix,

14:30.245 --> 14:33.956
medical marijuana can make
things fabulous, medically.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.377
So, my mellow fellow citizens,

14:38.461 --> 14:40.045
when you go into that voting booth

14:40.129 --> 14:41.547
on Tuesday, the seventh...

14:42.757 --> 14:45.509
Uh, Homer, that was yesterday.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.601
Oh, man! They already
voted! And we lost!

14:56.521 --> 15:00.274
Oh, man! I can't believe
we spaced on the date!

15:00.358 --> 15:01.608
What are we gonna do?

15:01.693 --> 15:02.901
Well, we can't just stand here

15:02.986 --> 15:07.072
staring at our hands, although... Wow!

15:07.824 --> 15:10.909
That's right! I married that chick.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.791
They call them fingers,
but I never see them fing.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.293
Oh, there they go.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.007
There we go. Dump all that
medical marijuana on there.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.057
Actually, that smoke is
a little too inviting.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.351
Throw on that sack of barber hair.

15:41.691 --> 15:46.111
I could've smoked that
pot and worn that hair.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.780
Homie, you don't need drugs anymore.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.407
Your eyes are all better.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.784
Eyes? What the hell
are you talking about?

15:52.869 --> 15:57.247
I want my old dad back. The one
who was yelling all the time and...

15:57.332 --> 15:59.791
You know, I'm not
really sure what I want.

15:59.876 --> 16:03.712
Homer, it's over. I want
you to look at your children

16:03.796 --> 16:06.923
and promise them you
will never do drugs again.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.470
All right, I'll do it for my kids.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.221
As long as you're doing things for me,

16:13.306 --> 16:14.348
would you tie up your bathrobe

16:14.432 --> 16:15.557
when you walk around the house?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.725
Never!

16:20.938 --> 16:22.898
Yeah, I can still crash here, right?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.149
Get out.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.068
Remember when I dropped my keys

16:26.152 --> 16:27.944
and you thought the phone was ringing?

16:28.029 --> 16:29.446
Yeah.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.115
Get out.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.077
What's the matter, Homer? You're drunk.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.662
But you're not like sloppy drunk.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.831
Going cold turkey isn't
as delicious as it sounds.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.834
Look, I'm really glad
you're off the wacky-tobacky.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.629
Yeah. You were getting
all spacey and everything.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.005
We were gonna have an intervention.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.467
Yeah. But at the planning
party, I got alcohol poisoning.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.135
I nearly died.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.973
I was already making excuses
not to go to your funeral.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.812
It's been three days,
and my mind is clearer.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.690
My sperm count is up, and I'm able to

17:04.773 --> 17:07.108
recognize simple shapes and patterns.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.861
Dad, you just said
that three minutes ago.

17:09.945 --> 17:14.031
Unregardless, I will no
longer be a slave to this!

17:14.325 --> 17:16.034
Why are you keeping that thing?

17:16.118 --> 17:17.285
As a reminder, Marge.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.789
Yello.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.874
Ahoy-hoy, Executive V. P.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.585
I'm putting the final touches
on my speech to the investors.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.628
And I need your generous guffaws.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.756
But I can't find you funny anymore.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.968
I'll either tickle your
ribs or feed them to my dogs!

17:33.094 --> 17:36.179
Now, we're ordering out. What
would you like on your pizza pie?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.556
Extra cheese?

17:37.640 --> 17:41.852
What do you take me for?
Lorenzo de' Medici? See you soon.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.979
Don't worry, Homie.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.566
You don't need Mary Jane to
laugh at Mr. Burns' jokes.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.192
Just picture him naked.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.572
Or... With a funny hat on!

17:58.035 --> 18:00.996
"So, profit margins will be thinner

18:02.582 --> 18:05.041
"than Louise Brooks' negligee. "

18:06.669 --> 18:11.214
You know, Louise Brooks,
the silent star of Lulu.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.800
One of us has got to start laughing.

18:13.885 --> 18:17.512
If Mr. Burns gets flop sweat,
he'll die of dehydration.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.015
I'm drenched with sweat.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.769
I'm going to take a bathiola.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.730
When I come back, you'd
better be laughing.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.693
This stuff can make anything funny,

18:31.819 --> 18:33.945
even that show that follows Friends.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.615
But I promised my family I
wouldn't smoke it anymore.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.408
Well, I've got to do something.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.243
Start inhaling, Waylon.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.332
This suit used to
belong to Judy Garland.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.251
We could sing a song if you
don't mind being Mickey Rooney.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.213
You mean that guy on 60
Minutes who yells all the time?

18:51.297 --> 18:54.883
Sixty minutes? Oh, my God! Mr. Burns
has been in the tub for an hour!

19:01.808 --> 19:06.853
Oh, Mr. Burns! You were too
beautiful for this world.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.442
Oh, man. Oh, man. We killed Mr. Burns!

19:12.527 --> 19:14.694
Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad!

19:14.779 --> 19:16.822
The investors meeting is in 20 minutes!

19:16.906 --> 19:18.990
So what? Mr. Burns is dead!

19:19.075 --> 19:21.660
We can carry on. Michael
Eisner's been dead for five years.

19:21.744 --> 19:25.121
Ted Turner's just a hologram.
Now, we got to think.

19:25.540 --> 19:29.042
So, when somebody says I was
an embarrassment to the country,

19:29.126 --> 19:32.754
I say, "It depends on what
the meaning of 'was' is, jerk!"

19:34.507 --> 19:37.634
You owe me $200,000.
Good night, everybody!

19:40.012 --> 19:43.932
Bill Clinton, everyone! He's
Jimmy Carter with a Fox attitude!

19:45.893 --> 19:49.354
And now, a man you will
see is definitely not dead,

19:49.438 --> 19:51.731
Mr. Montgomery Burns!

19:58.406 --> 20:02.033
Mr. Burns, as we're running
long, may we skip your speech

20:02.118 --> 20:03.785
and go directly to the questions?

20:05.454 --> 20:08.331
Mr. Burns, a two-part question.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.834
One, when will you see a profit again?

20:10.918 --> 20:14.629
And two, what's that red
stuff coming out of your ear?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.257
Mr. Burns, may I field that one?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.802
It's true we're losing money.

20:22.179 --> 20:26.641
But there's no reason we can't
dance, dance, dance the night away!

20:53.794 --> 20:56.212
Mr. Burns has left the building!

20:56.297 --> 21:00.008
We are mollified!

21:01.636 --> 21:03.595
Brilliant. We lost $60 million

21:03.679 --> 21:05.263
and they're cheering for more.

21:05.348 --> 21:08.433
Mr. Burns, you're alive!

21:08.517 --> 21:11.478
Yes. I regained consciousness
during my big dance number.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.521
Those strings pulling me every which way

21:13.606 --> 21:15.231
jostled my heart from its slumber.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.943
And you wanted to take
him to the hospital!

21:18.194 --> 21:21.613
Oh, and you didn't? Well, the
worm has finally shown its fangs!

21:21.697 --> 21:23.531
Smithers, make me slap him!

21:23.616 --> 21:26.242
You call that a slap? Make me slap you.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.578
Now, both.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.205
Now, just you.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.957
Now, give me a taste.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.001
Now, both again.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.172
Now, all three.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.882
Excellent.
