09:57.163 --> 09:58.431

09:58.498 --> 10:00.366

10:00.433 --> 10:03.870
My house is a trailer,
and all the wheels are flat.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.706
My last solid food
was an ice cube.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.543

how would you like a mentor?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.790
What's a mentor?

10:57.857 --> 11:00.560
A mentor is
a special kind of teacher.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.262
But you don't know nothing.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.030
Hey, there's lots
I can teach you.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.999
How to steal filling from a pie.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.067
How to get cookies
without giving blood.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.203
How to use spearmint gum
as a deodorant.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.739
And maybe I'll get someone
to fix your teeth.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.674
There's a doctor for your teeth?

11:14.741 --> 11:15.842
Mm‐hmm.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.076
Wow.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.779
Can you teach me
how to do this maze?

11:19.846 --> 11:22.749
Well, it'll be a project
we can work on together.

11:22.815 --> 11:23.983
Cool.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.953
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm out of ketchup.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.756
(whispering loudly):
I'll give it back

11:29.822 --> 11:32.091

11:32.158 --> 11:33.826
(tires screech)

11:34.827 --> 11:36.296
Hello, Bart.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.232
Just wanted you to know
I'm going to Nelson's house.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.268
We're close. <i>Super</i> close.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.637
First of all, Dad,
you called <i>me.</i>

11:44.704 --> 11:47.307
And second,
are you mentoring Nelson

11:47.373 --> 11:49.442
just to get back at Bart?

11:49.509 --> 11:51.211
No! No way!

11:51.277 --> 11:54.681
But if you happen to see Bart,
show him these.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.056

12:03.122 --> 12:04.924
Okay, kid,
I'm gonna teach you how to pack

12:04.991 --> 12:07.093
for when your wife
kicks you out of the house.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.429
Are the clothes thrown out
onto the front yard?

12:09.495 --> 12:12.165
Well, let's say you have
enough time to get a suitcase.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.566
What's a suitcase?

12:13.633 --> 12:16.069
Uh, all right,
let's move on to something else.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.839
Okay, but first I got to ask:
Are you sleeping with my mom?!

12:19.906 --> 12:21.441
‐No.
‐(sobs): Oh.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.676
No one's ever said that!

12:26.713 --> 12:28.648
That's what
we're going for, boys.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.451
I can't believe we're gonna be
in the pride parade.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.986
Christian pride.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.955
Finally, Christians
can openly show our faith.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.224
ROD and TODD:
We're sure! We're pure!

12:38.291 --> 12:39.659

12:39.726 --> 12:41.527
‐(bicycle bell rings)
‐Hey, Bart.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.796
Look who I taught
how to ride a bike.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.798
Nelson already knew
how to ride a bike.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.901
Yeah, but he didn't know how
to make cool motorcycle noises.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.900
‐Yes.
‐Are you gonna do anything?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.002
‐No.
‐Why not?

are you teaching Nelson?

13:48.127 --> 13:49.128

13:59.439 --> 14:01.207
That's a lot of money to me.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.911
But I want you to get some
therapy about what you're doing.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.680
40 bucks' worth of therapy

14:07.747 --> 14:09.615

14:14.287 --> 14:16.356

Get some help.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.725
Why are you doing this?

14:18.791 --> 14:21.394
Dad, I have to be
the voice of morality.

No, you don't.

my father never had time for me.

‐Time's up.

You are ruining two boys' lives

15:18.317 --> 15:20.453
Let me tell you
what a good therapist says.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.676
