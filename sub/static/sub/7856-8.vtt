00:01.819 --> 00:03.378
Russula emetica!

00:03.380 --> 00:04.498
Are you casting a spell?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.858
Common name, the Sickener.

00:06.860 --> 00:08.658
Sounds delicious.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.818
Oh, we can't eat this.

00:10.820 --> 00:13.058
I only wanted something to
put in my pie,

00:13.060 --> 00:17.458
I wasn't planning to spend the
morning traipsing around after you.

00:17.460 --> 00:21.340
So I am going to go to the grocer's
to buy some mushrooms.

00:24.260 --> 00:25.298
Look.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.620
What's wrong?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:36.060 --> 00:39.338
It's... it's a head.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.060
I think you should stay here.

00:42.340 --> 00:47.058
Please stay away. Please stay back.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.858
I just want to offer my prayers
for the deceased.

00:49.860 --> 00:53.178
The branch was blocking
the road at head height.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.138
He hit it at speed.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.860
It'll only take a few minutes.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.620
I'm afraid not.

01:48.260 --> 01:50.778
I am so sorry for your loss.

01:50.780 --> 01:53.098
Alexander said he'd always
be there for me.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.818
And he still is, Ian.

01:54.820 --> 01:56.780
Just... in a different way.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.700
Now, you're going
to have to be very brave today.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.419
I need to see him.

02:09.620 --> 02:10.940
Mrs Moore.

02:14.420 --> 02:17.460
I think that it is best that you
remember him as he was.

02:35.620 --> 02:36.740
I'm sorry.

02:38.740 --> 02:41.938
Alexander Moore was
a popular young man,

02:41.940 --> 02:44.858
a regular member of
this congregation.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.498
He worked hard in the family
business,

02:47.500 --> 02:50.700
rising early to bake fresh bread.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.258
His delicious Chelsea buns

02:54.260 --> 02:57.738
were responsible for many a guilty
glance in the mirror.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.300
His mother, Ruth...

03:06.420 --> 03:08.380
...would like to say a few words.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.020
Alexan...

03:24.740 --> 03:30.340
My Alexander was the perfect older
brother to Ian. He was...

03:33.620 --> 03:34.660
Get out.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.260
Get him out.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.138
Oh, dear God, no.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.498
Get out! Get away from here!

03:44.500 --> 03:46.058
Mr Blackstone.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.420
I'm sorry. I only wanted to offer
my condolences.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.538
We commend our brother to the Lord.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.178
May He embrace him in His peace

04:18.180 --> 04:21.980
and bring his body to life
again on the last day.

04:23.340 --> 04:25.060
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.178
Where have you been?

04:48.180 --> 04:49.458
Just in the village.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.938
It's quiet out, lots of people
have gone to the funeral.

04:51.940 --> 04:53.100
I know.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.418
You didn't?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.340
I simply went to pay my respects.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.020
Did she cause a scene?

05:01.980 --> 05:03.898
She'll have the police round.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.658
I haven't done anything wrong.

05:05.660 --> 05:07.138
You provoked her.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.258
After the lies she told about your
mother, she deserves all she gets.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.980
You're better than that.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.620
You need to eat something.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.218
If you want to talk about anything
come and find me.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.300
Even if it's
the middle of the night.

06:05.940 --> 06:07.340
Guess.

06:14.020 --> 06:15.458
Bad luck.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.298
Maybe next time, though, we could
add some money into the equation,

06:18.300 --> 06:19.978
make it a little bit more
interesting?

06:19.980 --> 06:22.978
It's already quite interesting
enough, thank you very much.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.900
But I do admire
your sleight of hand.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.578
What's happened?

06:30.580 --> 06:32.140
You'd better come and see.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.618
And this is the lad who
lost his head on Tuesday?

06:47.620 --> 06:48.978
Yes.

06:48.980 --> 06:50.420
Not been his week, has it?

06:52.020 --> 06:53.860
It's not a laughing matter.

06:55.220 --> 06:56.260
Have some tea.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.700
Thank you.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.818
I apologise...

07:02.820 --> 07:06.018
but this is an unspeakable crime.

07:06.020 --> 07:09.140
People are laid to
REST in this church.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.578
Let's treat this with
the respect it deserves.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.020
Absolutely, Padre.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.578
Could it be grave robbers?

07:21.580 --> 07:24.578
No. That vile practice died
out in the last century.

07:24.580 --> 07:29.138
I heard the mother had
an outburst at the funeral?

07:29.140 --> 07:33.178
Ruth Moore and Peter Blackstone
have been at each other's throats

07:33.180 --> 07:34.938
for as long as anyone
can remember.

07:34.940 --> 07:36.458
He's the undertaker?

07:36.460 --> 07:39.978
Yes. But he didn't do this burial,
for obvious reasons.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.898
What's their problem
with each other?

07:41.900 --> 07:43.418
No-one knows any more.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.620
Or much cares.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.098
I'd best go and let the mother know
what's happened.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.698
Inspector, I wondered if I might be
permitted to break the news to her?

07:53.700 --> 07:56.098
She is part of our congregation.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.418
Be my guest. I'll talk to her
once she's calmed down.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.660
Oh, you're all heart.

08:04.620 --> 08:08.658
Might take me a while to find
a vehicle to move the coffin.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.098
In the meantime,

08:10.100 --> 08:13.178
if there's anything else make sure
I'm the first to know.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.660
As always, Inspector.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.538
What happens
if this is just the beginning?

08:22.540 --> 08:25.578
If whoever did this comes back
another night?

08:25.580 --> 08:28.618
I'm sure those Blackstones
are involved.

08:28.620 --> 08:32.378
That girl was smiling
when she saw the accident.

08:32.380 --> 08:33.818
Doesn't prove anything.

08:33.820 --> 08:36.018
Oh, so she just happened to be
passing?

08:36.020 --> 08:42.018
Perhaps. Sid, can you find somewhere
discreet to store the coffin?

08:42.020 --> 08:44.578
And see what you can find
out about the Blackstones.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.740
Don't talk to them yet,
just have a nose about.

08:49.940 --> 08:52.740
There's something unpleasant
going on here.

09:00.580 --> 09:02.658
I've let you down.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.898
No, I don't blame you.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.418
You don't have to,
he blames himself.

09:07.420 --> 09:09.340
I think we all know who did this.

09:10.340 --> 09:11.698
Please, Ruth.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.298
There's only one person who hates
my family enough

09:14.300 --> 09:16.780
to do something so unspeakable.

09:18.660 --> 09:23.738
It may be coincidence that it was
Alexander's body that they, erm,

09:23.740 --> 09:25.420
they took.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.538
The soil was freshly turned,
it would be the easiest grave to dig.

09:31.540 --> 09:34.180
How will you manage in the bakery?

09:35.540 --> 09:37.218
It'll be hard.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.218
We were losing money as it was,

09:39.220 --> 09:42.418
and I didn't have to pay
Alexander the going rate.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.578
If you find yourself short,

09:44.580 --> 09:46.938
the Parish Committee
may be able to help.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.218
We have a small fund...

09:48.220 --> 09:50.340
I don't need charity. Thank you.

09:51.860 --> 09:56.538
I just wanted you to know
it's there, if you need it.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.018
We should be able to manage.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.820
Alexander had taken out
a life insurance policy.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.820
Oh, that was... fortunate.

10:05.020 --> 10:09.140
He always felt a duty to look
after us after my husband died.

10:10.580 --> 10:13.938
It won't be much but...

10:13.940 --> 10:16.218
but it should be enough
to tide us over

10:16.220 --> 10:20.578
until I can... work out...

10:20.580 --> 10:22.500
I'm sorry, I feel very hot.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.458
I need to get some air.

10:25.460 --> 10:26.900
We'll leave you in peace.

10:37.900 --> 10:41.220
I promise to get to
the bottom of this.

11:00.580 --> 11:03.458
You mustn't wait for me like this,
all right? Do you understand?

11:03.460 --> 11:06.498
- Why?
- Listen to me
you mustn't wait for me.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.420
It's best if you keep away from me.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.858
It's Ian, isn't it? Sidney.

11:15.860 --> 11:18.578
Sorry to hear about your brother.

11:18.580 --> 11:21.098
They all talk like he's dead,
but he's not.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.178
You what?

11:22.180 --> 11:23.738
He came back.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.540
Back? Back to life?

11:26.660 --> 11:28.180
He wants to be with his girlfriend.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.098
You sure you're not mistaken?

11:31.100 --> 11:32.380
I'm not a liar!

11:46.260 --> 11:48.978
Peter! Peter Blackstone!

11:48.980 --> 11:52.420
Come out here.
Tell me how you could do this.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.778
Do you know what he did?
That father of yours.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.018
He hasn't done anything.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.378
He dug up my boy!

11:58.380 --> 12:00.218
Ruth, go home.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.338
Is this where you took him?

12:02.340 --> 12:04.098
Catherine.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.900
Yes, run and hide.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.140
Ruth.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.418
You can't talk to her
when she's like that.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.898
It doesn't achieve anything.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.058
Did you hear what
she was accusing me of?

12:17.060 --> 12:18.098
The very thought!

12:19.220 --> 12:20.378
Hello?

12:20.380 --> 12:22.658
- Now what?
- I'll go.

12:22.660 --> 12:23.738
Who died?

12:23.740 --> 12:24.780
Nobody.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.020
What have you done?

12:41.020 --> 12:42.340
Nothing.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.738
Please.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.578
I telephoned you myself
as soon as we discovered the body.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.818
- Didn't I, Father?
- Take him to the station.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.100
Don't go far.

12:56.940 --> 13:01.338
Catherine, Mrs McCarthy said
she saw you in the woods,

13:01.340 --> 13:03.260
when Alexander had his accident.

13:04.620 --> 13:06.900
I don't know what you're
talking about.

13:14.380 --> 13:18.138
I should find a quieter patch -
like the centre of Glasgow.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.858
Inspector, there's a slight problem.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.020
Now what?

13:26.380 --> 13:28.660
You have got to be kidding me.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.820
Thank you for coming, Lady Felicia.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.658
- Ah.
- You really do prepare
for the worst, don't you?

13:37.660 --> 13:40.618
Sid was supposed to store it
somewhere discreet.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.140
Shall we?

13:43.860 --> 13:47.300
I'm not sure I can relax
with that thing looming over me.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.898
I'll get Sid to move it later.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.578
Any luck with Doctor Harris?

13:54.580 --> 13:56.818
No. He wouldn't take
my telephone calls,

13:56.820 --> 13:58.978
and then when I went round
to the surgery

13:58.980 --> 14:01.858
the receptionist pretended
he had left for the day.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.898
What has Dr Harris got to
do with this?

14:03.900 --> 14:06.938
He was in the woods
when Alexander had his accident.

14:06.940 --> 14:10.058
For now we have a more
pressing problem -

14:10.060 --> 14:11.738
the security of the graveyard.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.338
We have to allow for the possibility

14:13.340 --> 14:17.578
that what happened to Alexander
was not an isolated incident.

14:17.580 --> 14:20.498
I've drawn up the rota
for guard duty.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.458
You expect us to camp out
in the graveyard all night?

14:23.460 --> 14:27.378
I wouldn't ask you to do anything
I'm not prepared to do myself.

14:27.380 --> 14:30.578
I care about this community,
even if nobody else does.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.698
Oh, I don't mind mucking in.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.658
Dunkirk spirit, and all of that.

14:35.660 --> 14:38.178
Actually,
it could be terrific research.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.658
For what?

14:39.660 --> 14:41.898
I've never written
a ghost story before.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.178
On behalf of the world,
I'd like to thank you for that.

14:44.180 --> 14:47.578
I can see it now -
The Phantom And The Farmer.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.578
The tragic tale of the ghost
of a princess who falls in love

14:50.580 --> 14:52.778
with a humble dairy farmer.

14:52.780 --> 14:55.298
- You shouldn't joke
about such things.
- Farmers?

14:55.300 --> 14:58.538
- Ghosts.
- People enjoy a spooky story.
It gives them hope.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.418
That you'll stop writing books?

15:00.420 --> 15:03.178
That they'll see the people
that they love again.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.698
That death isn't the end.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.740
It isn't.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.978
I notice that you've taken
the earlier slot,

15:10.980 --> 15:12.538
while it's still light.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.098
It was random.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.020
So you won't mind swapping for 3am?

15:18.100 --> 15:21.300
Please!
I don't want anyone out there alone.

15:22.540 --> 15:25.938
If somebody comes back it would
be dangerous to confront them.

15:25.940 --> 15:27.858
We'll all be there together.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.938
Isn't that a little over-zealous?

15:29.940 --> 15:31.498
I've already let one family down.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.260
I don't want the same thing
to happen to another.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.298
I have no idea how it got there.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.018
Perhaps you should ask Ruth Moore?

15:42.020 --> 15:43.418
Why?

15:43.420 --> 15:46.058
There's no depth that woman
won't sink to.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.498
She once paid someone

15:47.500 --> 15:50.658
to try and seduce my daughter
then brag about it.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.060
Fortunately,
Catherine saw through him.

15:54.060 --> 15:57.018
What sort of idiots do you
take us for?

15:57.020 --> 15:59.060
Did you think we wouldn't notice?

16:00.700 --> 16:02.258
I don't know what you mean.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.778
The body.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.140
What about it?

16:06.220 --> 16:10.458
If their parents knew that they were
courting, they'd be furious.

16:10.460 --> 16:13.418
Though, if you think about it,
maybe he made it all up.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.538
Who knows what's
going on in the poor kid's head?

16:15.540 --> 16:17.618
He's away with
the fairies at the best of times.

16:17.620 --> 16:20.978
Anyway, now I've moved the coffin,
am I done?

16:20.980 --> 16:26.818
Er, yes. But I would
appreciate your help this evening.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.898
No can do, I'm afraid.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.858
Promised to help out
at the Red Lion.

16:30.860 --> 16:31.898
Oh.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.498
I've given my word.

16:33.500 --> 16:38.018
You know me, Father, I'd never break
that under any circumstances.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.898
Well, I'll have to have a word
with Mrs McCarthy,

16:40.900 --> 16:45.098
but, what if I offered a week
of free meals for your efforts?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.418
Hot meals?

16:46.420 --> 16:48.740
Yes. All lovingly home cooked.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.338
Deal.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.578
Excellent.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.298
You know I can't resist
Mrs M's pies.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.740
I'll see what I can do.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.818
Anything to report, McCarthy?

17:23.700 --> 17:25.698
Do you think it was Felicia?

17:25.700 --> 17:28.618
It was probably just another owl.

17:28.620 --> 17:32.498
Perhaps not the best choice of
night-time recognition signals.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.580
Come on.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.500
Lady Felicia?

17:45.580 --> 17:46.698
Lady F...

17:46.700 --> 17:48.300
Who disturbs me?

17:50.220 --> 17:51.578
Hold that thought!

17:51.580 --> 17:54.858
How does it feel to be
threatened by a spirit from beyond?

17:54.860 --> 17:59.018
This is a place of rest,
not your-your personal playground.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.698
Quickly, before the fear passes.
Describe it to me.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.578
I was not afraid! RATTLING

18:03.580 --> 18:04.978
What was that?

18:04.980 --> 18:08.978
What? Oh, probably just another
one of your ridiculous stunts?

18:08.980 --> 18:10.500
I'm standing right here.

18:12.540 --> 18:14.500
Um... Stay close. Follow me.

18:23.140 --> 18:24.620
What's going on?

18:27.260 --> 18:28.860
Come on, here it is!

18:31.420 --> 18:32.620
OK?

18:33.900 --> 18:35.820
Can I help you, fellas?

18:48.420 --> 18:52.298
Ah, hardly the most
sophisticated diversion,

18:52.300 --> 18:54.900
but I suppose you weren't
expecting company.

18:57.060 --> 18:58.700
Father! Father!

19:02.700 --> 19:04.618
Let me go!

19:04.620 --> 19:06.778
No, please don't hurt me!

19:06.780 --> 19:08.298
They've got away.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.338
Not to worry.
They were familiar faces -

19:10.340 --> 19:12.698
the undertakers from
Alexander's funeral.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.178
And what were you doing here?

19:14.180 --> 19:15.898
- They were after the coffin.
- Really?

19:15.900 --> 19:17.298
Why? HE GROANS

19:17.300 --> 19:19.738
Sid, Sid!
We don't do things like that.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.658
Thank you.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.778
Oh, don't think you're
going anywhere

19:23.780 --> 19:26.900
until you've told us exactly
what you were doing here.

19:28.220 --> 19:29.940
I, well, um...

19:31.740 --> 19:33.338
I've done a terrible thing.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.298
And what was that?

19:35.300 --> 19:39.818
I falsified the death certificate.
Alexander Moore.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.138
Why?

19:41.140 --> 19:44.138
I had to.
Catherine didn't give me a choice.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.298
Oh.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.340
What is it?

19:47.740 --> 19:49.658
You can go.

19:49.660 --> 19:51.940
The law will punish you.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.900
What did you do that for?

20:02.340 --> 20:06.578
Well, everything
we needed was right before our eyes.

20:06.580 --> 20:12.620
What we saw in the woods, and
at the funeral, it was all theatre.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.100
Alexander wasn't dead.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.740
We buried an empty coffin.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.738
What are you doing?

20:30.740 --> 20:32.860
Getting Alexander's things for him.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.138
Stop it.

20:35.140 --> 20:37.018
He'll need them.

20:37.020 --> 20:38.660
He won't, Ian. He's dead.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.860
Put it back. He's gone!

20:46.220 --> 20:48.418
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.660
Ian!

21:04.300 --> 21:07.340
Mrs Moore? I need to talk to you.

21:08.780 --> 21:10.020
What is it?

21:11.860 --> 21:15.338
Well, the good news is
we found your son's body.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.740
I've just been trying to clarify
what happened.

21:19.860 --> 21:20.900
Where was he?

21:22.380 --> 21:24.658
Peter Blackstone's workshop.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.738
I knew it.

21:26.740 --> 21:29.378
If the police had listened all
those times he harassed me,

21:29.380 --> 21:31.018
this would never
would have happened.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.180
There's something else.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500
I don't really know how to say this.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.220
His head's back on.

21:44.260 --> 21:46.338
Before the Mass,

21:46.340 --> 21:51.538
Ruth and I opened the lid
and saw Alexander's body.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.818
- Behave!
- Sorry.

21:57.820 --> 22:01.138
Then, I closed the lid.

22:01.140 --> 22:02.658
Are you all right in there?

22:02.660 --> 22:04.860
Hurry up, it's dark!
I don't like it!

22:06.500 --> 22:08.458
Then we said a mass for the dead.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.020
Meanwhile...

22:12.420 --> 22:13.738
Sid?

22:13.740 --> 22:15.340
Give me a minute.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.340
Ah, ladies!

22:21.940 --> 22:23.380
Do take a seat.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.458
Don't worry, it's only Sid.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.140
It's only me!

22:36.860 --> 22:39.218
What on earth are you
doing in there?

22:39.220 --> 22:40.778
Well, I couldn't find the catch.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.018
Catch?

22:42.020 --> 22:43.658
Ready for another try?

22:43.660 --> 22:46.260
These dinners you promised me
better be good.

22:50.860 --> 22:52.138
What we saw in the woods

22:52.140 --> 22:56.178
was just an attempt to make credible
witnesses for Alexander's death.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.618
We saw a body.

22:57.620 --> 22:58.898
Not at close quarters.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.218
We could have seen a mannequin
and an empty helmet.

23:02.220 --> 23:03.938
You saw Alexander at the funeral.

23:03.940 --> 23:07.058
Only for a few seconds and
the undertakers choreographed it

23:07.060 --> 23:09.498
so that Ruth would not be
alone with the body.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.738
Do you maybe want to have
this conversation

23:11.740 --> 23:13.378
when I'm not suffocating?

23:13.380 --> 23:16.218
If you don't talk, Sid,
you use less oxygen.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.658
You ready this time?

23:17.660 --> 23:19.060
Go!

23:21.900 --> 23:23.500
Oof - that hurt.

23:24.580 --> 23:26.138
It was hinged.

23:26.140 --> 23:29.178
All Alexander had to do
was wait underneath the cloth

23:29.180 --> 23:31.698
until the undertakers
took the coffin outside.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.218
Then he could escape unseen.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.098
But why would he do all of this?

23:35.100 --> 23:36.898
The question is, what went wrong?

23:36.900 --> 23:40.498
Between the sham funeral
and the following morning,

23:40.500 --> 23:41.940
Alexander did die.

23:43.540 --> 23:46.458
The good news is that
I believe that our graveyard

23:46.460 --> 23:48.418
is free from further interference.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.138
And what's the bad news?

23:50.140 --> 23:51.860
There's a killer on the loose.

23:54.580 --> 23:55.900
Please.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.620
Would you like a drink?

24:00.620 --> 24:04.340
No, thank you.
Bit early, even for me.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.138
I'm worried about my father.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.180
Of course.

24:10.780 --> 24:15.058
I keep thinking about your reaction
when you saw Alexander's body.

24:15.060 --> 24:16.818
I was shocked.

24:16.820 --> 24:20.740
More than that. You recoiled
when you touched his skin.

24:21.780 --> 24:23.978
You didn't expect it to be cold.

24:23.980 --> 24:25.818
You thought he was still alive.

24:25.820 --> 24:30.658
After all, you knew that
the funeral was a sham.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.818
What are you accusing me of?

24:32.820 --> 24:33.940
Falling in love.

24:35.380 --> 24:38.658
It must have been very hard for you,
hiding your feelings for him.

24:38.660 --> 24:41.260
And then seeing him, like that.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.740
It was like someone had sucked
all the air out of the room.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.618
This terrible thing was happening
right in front of me,

24:50.620 --> 24:54.178
and then suddenly the police
were blaming Father.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.058
It wasn't fair.

24:56.060 --> 24:59.218
What were you and Alexander
going to do after the funeral?

24:59.220 --> 25:02.298
I'm moving to London in a month
to train as a nurse.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.378
Alexander was going to
meet me there.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.780
You know, leave this stupid feud
behind us.

25:10.180 --> 25:13.618
Alexander felt guilty,
especially about leaving Ian.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.618
But he loved you more.

25:15.620 --> 25:17.978
At least this way,
with the insurance,

25:17.980 --> 25:20.618
he could make sure
they were properly looked after.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.778
How did you persuade Dr Harris
and the undertakers to help you?

25:23.780 --> 25:28.938
Oh, I know all about Dr Harris
and his wandering hands.

25:28.940 --> 25:30.260
But his wife doesn't.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.658
I see.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.620
He paid the undertakers
on our behalf.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.738
Did you see Alexander after
the funeral?

25:38.740 --> 25:44.580
No. I waited till the morning,
but... he never showed up.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.260
So you were here all the time?

25:48.620 --> 25:49.980
Not at first.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.858
I was getting ready to go downstairs

25:52.860 --> 25:55.140
when I saw his brother
out of the window.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.098
I didn't have the heart
to leave him.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.618
He'd seen Alexander in the street.

26:00.620 --> 26:04.378
Ian had run out after Alexander
but he had already gone.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.178
When I spoke to him,

26:06.180 --> 26:10.458
he actually thought his brother
had come back from the dead.

26:10.460 --> 26:11.820
Poor boy.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.098
What did you say to him?

26:15.100 --> 26:17.498
I couldn't tell him the truth,
could I?

26:17.500 --> 26:19.420
It would have ruined everything.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.980
I told him that he was right.

26:23.980 --> 26:28.978
That Alexander had come back from
the dead to be with me.

26:28.980 --> 26:31.378
That if he wanted Alexander
to be happy,

26:31.380 --> 26:33.858
he'd have to keep it a secret.

26:35.020 --> 26:38.818
I'm afraid he didn't
keep his part of THAT bargain.

26:38.820 --> 26:41.260
I know. I'm sorry.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.900
It's not me
you should be apologising to.

26:53.940 --> 27:00.138
Have you any idea why your father
hates Mrs Moore so much?

27:00.140 --> 27:02.698
No, he won't talk about it.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.178
He only says that everything
would have been easier

27:05.180 --> 27:06.700
if she'd never been born.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.220
Here she is.
Her date of birth, and...

27:27.900 --> 27:29.258
What?

27:29.260 --> 27:30.780
Look at that.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.338
Have you come to read me
my last rites?

27:37.340 --> 27:39.658
I know Ruth Moore is your sister.

27:39.660 --> 27:41.178
Is this a joke?

27:41.180 --> 27:45.458
Let's not play games. Mrs McCarthy
has checked the Parish Records.

27:45.460 --> 27:51.140
Is this what it's about,
all these years?

27:53.020 --> 27:56.620
Our parents couldn't afford to keep
more than one child...

27:58.460 --> 28:02.698
...and they wanted someone to take
over the family business.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.940
A son.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.820
They gave her away.

28:08.180 --> 28:12.058
I can just about remember Mother
being pregnant,

28:12.060 --> 28:13.580
but there was never a baby.

28:14.700 --> 28:19.258
I was very young, I don't think
I understood what had happened.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.378
When did you find out the truth?

28:21.380 --> 28:24.018
Not until after we were adults.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.218
My parents had died by then.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.260
Ruth had managed to trace me.

28:29.580 --> 28:35.180
She came to tell me that the family
who adopted her had been... unkind.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.418
And she blamed you for that?

28:38.420 --> 28:40.698
I was a child
when they gave her away.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.420
It wasn't my responsibility.

28:45.620 --> 28:48.818
What did you say
when she came to you?

28:48.820 --> 28:53.460
She... wanted a share
of my inheritance.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.618
I had my own family to
think of by then,

28:57.620 --> 29:00.140
I couldn't let her interfere
with our livelihood.

29:01.260 --> 29:02.778
You turned her away?

29:02.780 --> 29:07.740
I...hoped she'd leave Kembleford,
start over somewhere new.

29:09.460 --> 29:14.060
But she stayed here, to spite me.

29:15.660 --> 29:18.980
From that day, she's been
a constant thorn in my side.

29:20.940 --> 29:24.780
Did you know Alexander and Catherine
were having a sexual relationship?

29:26.500 --> 29:27.978
That can't be. They're...

29:27.980 --> 29:29.180
Cousins. Yes.

29:31.740 --> 29:32.858
How could they?

29:32.860 --> 29:34.658
Because they didn't know.

29:34.660 --> 29:38.940
Because their parents preferred
to live surrounded by lies.

29:40.100 --> 29:45.180
I have come here to PLEAD
with you to END this.

29:48.540 --> 29:49.820
Sergeant!

29:50.820 --> 29:52.340
We're finished here.

30:11.620 --> 30:12.820
Hello, Ian.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.300
What are you doing here?

30:18.060 --> 30:23.898
Sid told me that you
saw your brother after his funeral.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.300
I've been waiting
for Alexander to come back again.

30:27.500 --> 30:30.460
He hasn't yet. I brought his things.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.498
He might need them.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.620
That's very thoughtful of you.
What did you bring him?

30:38.940 --> 30:43.098
Clothes, books. His watch.

30:45.380 --> 30:46.860
Can I see?

31:00.100 --> 31:02.978
Where did you find his watch?

31:02.980 --> 31:05.060
Mother had it in her bedroom.

31:08.180 --> 31:11.300
It must have been frightening,
seeing Alexander.

31:13.020 --> 31:15.900
No. He's my brother.

31:18.580 --> 31:19.900
Ian...

31:22.060 --> 31:24.260
Alexander won't be
coming back again.

31:26.140 --> 31:30.458
They said he was dead the other
night, but they were wrong.

31:30.460 --> 31:31.820
I checked.

31:37.740 --> 31:39.180
How did you check?

31:40.980 --> 31:43.978
I thought I might be
imagining things,

31:43.980 --> 31:45.820
so I had to make sure.

31:47.780 --> 31:51.138
Ian, did you dig up
your brother's grave?

31:51.140 --> 31:54.858
The coffin was empty.
He'd already risen up.

31:54.860 --> 31:56.418
What I saw was real.

31:56.420 --> 31:58.140
It must have taken you hours.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.698
Am I in trouble?

32:01.700 --> 32:02.900
No.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.580
YOU haven't done anything wrong.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.140
Catherine didn't tell you
the whole story.

32:14.420 --> 32:16.058
She lied to me?

32:16.060 --> 32:17.460
Yes.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.980
Ian, wait, please.

32:30.380 --> 32:33.778
My son paid his premiums.
You have to honour it...

32:33.780 --> 32:36.378
Listen to me, we need this money.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.298
I have another son,
he needs food, clothes.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.498
My business will not support us...

32:41.500 --> 32:43.658
I don't care what the police said.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.580
There was nothing suspicious...

32:46.940 --> 32:48.178
My son died.

32:48.180 --> 32:49.698
Isn't that enough for you?

32:49.700 --> 32:52.460
Don't you think my family
have suffered enough?

32:54.660 --> 32:57.338
Wait, I don't have any more coins...

32:57.340 --> 32:59.298
Wait, please.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.380
Please...

33:26.580 --> 33:29.138
The priest said you lied to me.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.980
Is that true?

34:04.140 --> 34:08.500
You put the idea in my head
and I made up a story.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.739
A silly ghost story.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.938
But I saw him.

34:14.940 --> 34:17.860
We were going to run away together,
that was real.

34:18.980 --> 34:20.780
But Alexander was still alive.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.460
There was a funeral.

34:25.739 --> 34:29.340
They buried an empty box.
It was a trick.

34:31.739 --> 34:32.980
But then...

34:34.020 --> 34:35.219
He died for real.

34:39.940 --> 34:41.699
I'm so sorry.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.780
Sh... Sh.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.060
Ian.

35:03.260 --> 35:04.778
Oh.

35:04.780 --> 35:07.018
Keep back. It's filling with gas.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.340
Why, Ruth?

35:09.660 --> 35:11.940
The insurance firm won't pay out.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.138
I'm going to lose everything
and it's all his fault!

35:16.140 --> 35:21.898
This conflict has already cost
one life. Let it stop now.

35:21.900 --> 35:24.060
Why? I'm already damned.

35:25.260 --> 35:28.178
It's never too late
to ask for forgiveness.

35:28.180 --> 35:30.900
And I know that you are carrying
a great burden.

35:32.940 --> 35:34.300
What, what burden?

35:35.420 --> 35:38.020
You're responsible
for Alexander's death.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.418
No.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.180
He was buried
wearing his pocket watch.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.818
Then when we found the body again,
it was missing.

35:48.820 --> 35:51.658
Ian took it from your bedroom
this morning.

35:51.660 --> 35:54.058
The only way that you could
have had it was

35:54.060 --> 35:56.340
if you saw Alexander after
the funeral.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.580
Put the matches away.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.780
I think death might be a release!

36:09.780 --> 36:11.300
Is this where it happened?

36:13.420 --> 36:15.578
Alexander's body was found
in the workshop,

36:15.580 --> 36:18.658
but I don't think you were strong
enough to have carried it far,

36:18.660 --> 36:20.498
so it must have happened nearby.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.458
I didn't mean to hurt him.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.100
I believe that.

36:28.900 --> 36:31.900
At first, I thought I was going mad.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.300
What are you?

36:49.060 --> 36:50.740
It's me.

36:51.820 --> 36:53.180
Just me.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.258
See?

36:59.260 --> 37:01.820
Flesh and blood.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.660
How did you find me?

37:11.780 --> 37:15.698
I was looking for Ian,
I saw you in the street.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.018
We had to do it this way,
so you wouldn't know.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.460
I'm sorry.

37:21.780 --> 37:24.458
You wanted to get away from me?

37:24.460 --> 37:26.260
I do love you, Mother.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.660
What do you mean "we"?

37:36.980 --> 37:39.258
Not her. Please.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.338
I love her.

37:40.340 --> 37:41.858
Not her. You can't.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.018
I don't know what your problem
with her father is,

37:44.020 --> 37:46.180
but we've had enough of it.
- She's your cousin.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.658
What?

37:48.660 --> 37:51.458
You're related. Too closely related.

37:51.460 --> 37:53.338
You see now?
What would people think?

37:53.340 --> 37:54.698
We'd be outcasts.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.898
Come back home. We'll make it right.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.778
Just keep away from her.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.818
Ian will be so pleased to see you.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.940
Alexander?

38:03.220 --> 38:06.058
I'm not coming.
I'm meant to be with her.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.498
Don't say that!

38:07.500 --> 38:08.898
It's true.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.298
This can't happen.
Not now you know the truth.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.538
Mother, I don't care.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.300
Why did you take his pocket watch?

38:22.900 --> 38:26.378
It was a present for
Alexander's 18th birthday.

38:26.380 --> 38:28.698
He cherished it,
he always carried it on him.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.898
What else do I have of him now?

38:30.900 --> 38:32.658
Your memories.

38:32.660 --> 38:35.898
You have to believe me,
this whole thing was an accident.

38:35.900 --> 38:38.858
Perhaps his death was,

38:38.860 --> 38:43.578
but then you tried to frame Peter
for his murder.

38:43.580 --> 38:45.858
THAT was deliberate.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.058
Do you know what he did,
that father of yours?

38:48.060 --> 38:49.298
He hasn't done anything.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.058
He dug up my boy!

38:51.060 --> 38:53.218
This whole feud is Peter's fault.

38:53.220 --> 38:57.260
I just wanted to be
accepted by the family. MY family!

38:58.540 --> 39:03.898
Do you know that Ian spent
the whole night

39:03.900 --> 39:05.858
digging up his brother's grave

39:05.860 --> 39:08.858
because he couldn't bear
to be parted from him?

39:08.860 --> 39:09.898
What?

39:09.900 --> 39:11.060
No!

39:13.900 --> 39:15.780
If you light that match...

39:17.460 --> 39:19.258
...we will die,

39:19.260 --> 39:21.218
and then what will happen to Ian

39:21.220 --> 39:23.500
when he's lost his mother
and his brother?

39:27.980 --> 39:29.340
Move away.

39:31.980 --> 39:38.298
If there's anyone in the house,
come out. It's not safe.

39:41.660 --> 39:43.060
Ian!

39:56.740 --> 40:00.780
I've done a terrible thing.
And I blamed you for it.

40:03.660 --> 40:04.980
I'm sorry.

40:07.580 --> 40:09.938
It was me.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.940
I left Alexander's
body in your workshop.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.100
I wanted to see you blamed for it.

40:21.060 --> 40:24.698
Is this a trick?
Some way to get money from me?

40:24.700 --> 40:27.418
I don't care about your damn money!

40:27.420 --> 40:28.738
This whole thing started

40:28.740 --> 40:32.338
because you wanted to try
and stake a claim on my inheritance.

40:32.340 --> 40:35.140
No! I only ever wanted a family.

40:36.380 --> 40:39.220
MY family.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.140
You turned me away!

40:50.420 --> 40:52.538
I'm going to tell the police
my story,

40:52.540 --> 40:54.620
but I think you should
hear it first.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.538
'Did you tell him everything?'

41:10.540 --> 41:13.058
Yes.

41:13.060 --> 41:14.938
And things have changed.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.100
How?

41:17.700 --> 41:20.818
He's... He's going to try
and help me keep afloat.

41:20.820 --> 41:23.300
Get my business back to
the way it used to be.

41:24.620 --> 41:27.500
I thought you'd have more
to talk about than money.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.498
Peter is going to tell the police

41:30.500 --> 41:33.098
that he found Alexander
at the bottom of the stairs.

41:33.100 --> 41:34.978
Panicked and tried to hide the body.

41:34.980 --> 41:36.780
So he'll take the blame for you?

41:37.860 --> 41:41.698
The police can't prove anyone else
was there when Alexander fell.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.460
He could have just been meddling
where he shouldn't have been.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.620
I realise you know the truth.

41:52.740 --> 41:58.820
All I can do is beg you
to keep it to yourself.

42:00.420 --> 42:03.138
Peter isn't going to
lie for my sake, it's for Ian.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.940
He doesn't want him
to grow up without his mother.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.660
Father?

42:12.460 --> 42:15.940
I can only follow my conscience,
and I think that someone...

42:18.300 --> 42:21.820
...needs to give your family
a chance to heal its wounds.

42:27.140 --> 42:28.980
Thank you.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.900
Thank you.

42:36.580 --> 42:41.738
"The princess knew that love could
overcome even death,

42:41.740 --> 42:44.818
"but would the dairy farmer...

42:44.820 --> 42:48.178
"would the dairy farmer
ever notice her?

42:48.180 --> 42:50.898
"He was a man of simple tastes,

42:50.900 --> 42:54.698
"more used to the company of cows
than royalty."

42:54.700 --> 42:57.498
I envy him. Right, I'll be off.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.138
Sorry? Where are you going?

42:59.140 --> 43:00.378
Home.

43:00.380 --> 43:03.378
I've got this lovely chicken
and mushroom pie waiting for me.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.778
- Yum, yum.
- Hang about. What about mine?

43:05.780 --> 43:08.178
Doesn't anybody
want to know how it ends?

43:08.180 --> 43:12.178
Perhaps it's best listened
to in instalments. Like Dickens.

43:12.180 --> 43:14.738
You may be right.
It is a very intense tale.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.338
Sorry, where's my supper?

43:17.340 --> 43:18.818
It's nearly ready.

43:18.820 --> 43:20.858
I'm dining Chez Westwoods.

43:20.860 --> 43:22.258
Bon appetit.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.300
Au revoir.

43:24.660 --> 43:26.218
Shall we see how it's going?

43:26.220 --> 43:28.018
This is not what we agreed.

43:28.020 --> 43:32.140
Free meals every day for a week.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.938
Is that done?

43:45.940 --> 43:48.500
Only... I don't really know.

43:52.100 --> 43:53.620
Not to worry.

43:54.660 --> 43:57.220
I'll get the hang of it
by the end of the week.
