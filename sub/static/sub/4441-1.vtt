WEBVTT

00:02.348 --> 00:04.107
So long, girl next door.

00:04.108 --> 00:07.560
I hope they find my body before
the smell becomes a problem for you.

00:07.561 --> 00:10.497
I completely forgot to make
arrangements for my dog,

00:10.498 --> 00:13.317
and they say that if I leave him
in the house...

00:13.318 --> 00:16.566
Would it be okay if he stayed in your yard
until I get home from work?

00:16.567 --> 00:18.612
- Got any DVDs?
- A few.

00:18.613 --> 00:19.958
I like Matt Damon.

00:26.115 --> 00:27.953
- Jenna's in trouble.
- What's happened?

00:27.954 --> 00:29.791
I'm gonna lose Jenna,
and it's all your fault.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.282
Do whatever it takes!

00:32.408 --> 00:34.108
Wilfred? Wilfred!

00:34.109 --> 00:36.750
Who are you?
There's a stranger in my room!

00:36.751 --> 00:39.609
- Nurse! I don't know you!
- Tell me what to do!

00:39.610 --> 00:40.840
Get out!

01:05.337 --> 01:07.905
(Echoing voice):
Ryan?

01:09.444 --> 01:12.889
Ryan?

01:12.890 --> 01:14.760
Ryan!

01:16.132 --> 01:17.899
Is Thursday going to happen?

01:17.900 --> 01:19.939
Thursday?

01:19.940 --> 01:22.442
Yes, Thursday.

01:22.443 --> 01:25.882
Is Thursday possible?

01:29.657 --> 01:33.226
I-I think so.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.961
You think so.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.997
I don't want to hear
what you think.

01:36.998 --> 01:39.165
I want to hear what you know.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.268
And I want you to know it
in your brain,

01:41.269 --> 01:42.969
I want you to know it
in your heart,

01:42.970 --> 01:44.637
and I want you to know it
in your balls!

01:47.173 --> 01:50.944
(Man hocking)

01:50.945 --> 01:53.681
Let me remind you, all of you,
what's at stake here...

01:53.682 --> 01:57.655
Millions of lives,
billions of dollars.

01:57.656 --> 01:59.123
Life, Ryan.

01:59.124 --> 02:00.625
Life itself.

02:00.626 --> 02:04.163
So I'm gonna take another
five goddamn seconds

02:04.164 --> 02:06.233
out of my incredibly
valuable time,

02:06.234 --> 02:11.174
and I'm gonna ask you again...
Will you be ready on Thursday?!

02:11.175 --> 02:14.412
It said, "wake up."

02:14.413 --> 02:16.482
Which is weird
because I read somewhere

02:16.483 --> 02:18.084
that people can't read
when they're dreaming.

02:18.085 --> 02:20.988
Well, maybe you dreamed
that you read that.

02:20.989 --> 02:22.657
(Both chuckle)

02:22.658 --> 02:24.192
Then you woke up.

02:24.193 --> 02:26.096
It felts so real.
Mm-hmm.

02:26.097 --> 02:28.498
And I had a report
or something due...

02:28.499 --> 02:33.038
On Thursday. Today.

02:33.039 --> 02:34.606
Dreams are the way

02:34.607 --> 02:36.342
our subconscious communicates
with us.

02:36.343 --> 02:39.045
What do you think you're trying
to tell yourself, Ryan?

02:39.046 --> 02:41.247
Remember: There's
no right or wrong answer.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.884
It was a stress dream.

02:43.885 --> 02:45.085
That's the right answer.

02:47.255 --> 02:49.090
Do you think
I'm ready for today?

02:49.091 --> 02:50.491
I mean, I feel like I am,

02:50.492 --> 02:51.793
but maybe deep down...

02:51.794 --> 02:53.194
Whoa, whoa!
Slow down, Hamlet.

02:53.195 --> 02:54.929
Let's not overthink this.

02:54.930 --> 02:57.431
That's what got you here
in the first place, remember?

02:57.432 --> 03:00.434
You're about to see
Jenna and Wilfred

03:00.435 --> 03:02.303
for the first time
in nearly four months.

03:02.304 --> 03:05.039
A little anxiety
is to be expected.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.773
But you've learned how

03:06.774 --> 03:08.776
to accept the world
as it really is, right?

03:11.379 --> 03:13.948
So maybe it's time to see
Wilfred as he really is.

03:19.790 --> 03:21.191
I'm ready.

03:29.402 --> 03:32.805
You are gonna be so excited
when you see Ryan.

03:43.885 --> 03:46.054
Hey, thanks for driving
all the way up here.

03:46.055 --> 03:47.589
It's so great to see you.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.124
How are you doing?

03:49.125 --> 03:50.993
Oh, good.

03:50.994 --> 03:52.561
Just needed some time away.

03:54.765 --> 03:57.868
- So, you married yet?
- Actually, Drew and I broke up

03:57.869 --> 03:59.236
when we found out
I wasn't pregnant.

03:59.237 --> 04:01.605
Oh. I'm sorry.

04:01.606 --> 04:03.141
It's for the best.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.842
I've had my hands full
with Wilfred.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.244
His recovery's been slow.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.712
But I think spending
a couple days

04:07.713 --> 04:09.314
with his best buddy
is gonna do wonders

04:09.315 --> 04:10.549
for his spirit.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.351
Isn't that right, Wilfie?

04:17.190 --> 04:19.558
So, it all came back to you?

04:19.559 --> 04:21.426
You remember everything?

04:21.427 --> 04:26.331
<i>Yeah. There's nothing
wrong with my mind.</i>

04:26.332 --> 04:29.468
I'm not sure we can say
the same about yours.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.439
I don't need your help.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.741
Wilfred, you're disabled.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.111
No! I'm not defined
by my injuries, Ryan.

04:38.112 --> 04:42.016
I can do anything you can.

04:42.017 --> 04:47.154
(Grunts)
I'm not to be pitied...

04:47.155 --> 04:50.124
And I don't need
to be waited upon.

04:56.898 --> 05:00.234
I guess it's the least I can do
after the way I treated you.

05:00.235 --> 05:03.938
I'm really sorry, Wilfred.

05:03.939 --> 05:06.473
Well, maybe none of this
would have happened

05:06.474 --> 05:08.342
if I'd been honest with you.

05:08.343 --> 05:09.743
About what?

05:09.744 --> 05:12.679
Me, who I am,

05:12.680 --> 05:13.980
why I'm here.

05:16.184 --> 05:18.185
After all we've been through,

05:18.186 --> 05:20.554
I think it's time
I gave you some answers.

05:20.555 --> 05:22.255
Let's start with an easy one.

05:22.256 --> 05:25.025
Why are you the only person
who can hear me speak?

05:25.026 --> 05:27.194
Ryan, you and I...

05:27.195 --> 05:29.163
Stop! I don't want
to know.

05:29.164 --> 05:31.331
Of course you do.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.000
I can't trust a word you say.

05:33.001 --> 05:35.336
And even if I could,
I don't care anymore.

05:35.337 --> 05:37.271
I just want to stay
out of my head

05:37.272 --> 05:38.739
and live in the real world.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.123
I can't. I'm on medication.

05:56.124 --> 05:59.027
(Chuckles)
Medication? What for?

05:59.028 --> 06:00.895
Because I need it.

06:00.896 --> 06:05.366
Ryan, when I was lying
in that hospital bed,

06:05.367 --> 06:07.334
crumpled up like some metaphor

06:07.335 --> 06:08.902
of a crumpled-up
aluminum can,

06:08.903 --> 06:11.037
I had a lot of time to think.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.641
And like you,
I just wanted it all to stop.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.443
At first, I tried
to wank the thoughts away.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.279
I wanked so much, I had nothin
left by mid-morning.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.447
I was totally dry.

06:21.448 --> 06:24.550
My penis eye was just like puh!

06:24.551 --> 06:27.086
What are you talking about?
Hear me out.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.555
Do you know why dogs dig?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.890
'Cause they're searching
for bones?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.558
Because we're searching
for truth.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.393
That's what I needed to find.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.495
So I dragged myself
out of that bed

06:37.496 --> 06:38.729
and started to dig.

06:38.730 --> 06:40.464
I dug for hours.

06:40.465 --> 06:44.368
My paws were a bloody mess,
but I kept digging and digging,

06:44.369 --> 06:46.804
and I didn't stop
until I hit China!

06:46.805 --> 06:48.772
So much for truth.

06:48.773 --> 06:51.475
I'm not making this up!

06:51.476 --> 06:53.811
It was one of those
underground electrical chinas.

06:53.812 --> 06:56.314
Like they usually have
on the poles,

06:56.315 --> 06:57.615
with the telephone chinas.

06:57.616 --> 06:58.983
You mean wires?

06:58.984 --> 07:02.021
I don't know words, Ryan,
okay?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.557
We didn't all go
to Stanford Law School.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.627
My point is you can't stop
looking for answers.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.829
And if you ever want
to break through,

07:09.830 --> 07:11.497
then you got to get out
of this place.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.900
There's no life for you here.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.769
Not without me.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.470
This place saved me.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.272
I lost my mind, Wilfred.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.207
Apparently, for the better part
of three months,

07:21.208 --> 07:23.843
I was sitting in a coat closet
getting baked with a dog.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.245
That's messed up.

07:25.246 --> 07:27.013
What the hell
are you talking about?

07:27.014 --> 07:28.381
After you got amnesia,

07:28.382 --> 07:30.049
I tried to get down
to the basement

07:30.050 --> 07:31.250
to find your will.

07:31.251 --> 07:35.388
But the basement wasn there.
It was never there.

07:35.389 --> 07:36.990
(Chuckles)
That's crazy.

07:36.991 --> 07:39.459
I mean, what you have
to ask yourself, Ryan...

07:39.460 --> 07:41.894
No, no, I'm not gonna think
myself back to insanity.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.996
No more questions!

07:43.997 --> 07:45.297
Ryan, you can't stop now.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.965
Don't you want to know
who you are?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.000
I know who I am.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.770
And I know what you are.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.538
You're the part of me
that lies to me,

07:53.539 --> 07:55.974
and I'm through listening.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.943
Ryan...

07:57.944 --> 08:01.847
You can't run away from me
just because I'm in this chair.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.382
(Thunks)

08:03.383 --> 08:06.284
(Controls clicking)

08:06.285 --> 08:10.355
Christ! Will someone get this
Tic-Tac from under my wheel?!

08:10.356 --> 08:13.025
Bloody Tic-Tac
under my wheel.

08:16.684 --> 08:20.219
So, Jenna and I got caught up
on gossip from the neighborhood.

08:20.220 --> 08:21.320
- Mm-hmm.
- That's about it.

08:21.321 --> 08:22.722
Very nice visit.

08:27.361 --> 08:30.064
Two pills? Why?

08:30.065 --> 08:32.732
I think we both know why, Ryan.

08:35.903 --> 08:37.037
What do these do?

08:37.038 --> 08:39.039
I hope they do the trick.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.207
Dr. Eddie, when can
I leave this place?

08:42.208 --> 08:44.210
Whenever you're ready.

08:44.211 --> 08:45.912
So, it's up to me?

08:45.913 --> 08:47.913
(Chuckles)
So many questions.

08:47.914 --> 08:50.416
That sounds more like
the old Ryan.

08:50.417 --> 08:54.086
So let's just focus
on the right now.

08:57.656 --> 09:00.058
You're gonna feel much
better in the morning.

09:20.313 --> 09:22.548
Woman:
Do you play tennis?

09:22.549 --> 09:24.683
Not really.

09:24.684 --> 09:26.618
That ball belonged
to a friend of mine.

09:26.619 --> 09:30.989
We should play sometime.

09:30.990 --> 09:35.426
I mean, if we ever finish
this stupid report.

09:41.432 --> 09:43.133
How long have we been here?

09:43.134 --> 09:44.134
I know, right?

09:44.135 --> 09:45.902
I mean it.

09:45.903 --> 09:47.304
Do we live here?

09:47.305 --> 09:48.572
I don't even know
what day it is.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.075
Why are there no windows
in here?

09:52.076 --> 09:52.909
(Woman moaning)

09:52.910 --> 09:54.411
What the hell is that?!

09:54.412 --> 09:56.246
That's Felicia.

09:58.850 --> 10:02.085
I gotta...
I gotta get out of here.

10:02.086 --> 10:03.820
Don't be ridiculous.
You know you can't leave.

10:03.821 --> 10:05.255
The hell I can't!

10:05.256 --> 10:06.523
(Guttural gurgling)

10:06.524 --> 10:08.191
(Panting)

10:08.192 --> 10:09.992
(Man yelling indistinctly)

10:09.993 --> 10:13.862
Please, somebody help me!

10:13.863 --> 10:15.664
(Yelling continues)

10:35.952 --> 10:38.689
You were right, Wilfred.

10:38.690 --> 10:41.191
There's something wrong
with this place.

10:41.192 --> 10:42.759
I told you!
Now come on.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.628
Get your car and let's
get out of here.

10:44.629 --> 10:46.563
It's a six-hour drive.
If we leave now,

10:46.564 --> 10:48.465
we might still be ab
to make that concert.

10:48.466 --> 10:50.000
What concert?

10:50.001 --> 10:51.869
My Morning Jacket.

10:51.870 --> 10:54.072
Two seats front
and center, dude!

10:54.073 --> 10:56.107
- I love that band.
- I know.

10:56.108 --> 10:59.545
That's why we should leave early
so we can get you a ticket.

10:59.546 --> 11:00.980
You have two.

11:00.981 --> 11:04.316
Yeah, I sort of promised Bear
the other ticket.

11:04.317 --> 11:05.784
Bear?

11:05.785 --> 11:08.420
You gave my ticket
to a stuffed animal?

11:08.421 --> 11:10.122
Don't worry.

11:10.123 --> 11:12.190
I'm sure we can score
a ticket off a scalper.

11:12.191 --> 11:14.593
And we're gonna need your I.D.
to get alcohol wristbands.

11:14.594 --> 11:16.161
Shit, yes!

11:16.162 --> 11:17.729
Also, I'm gonna need
to borrow some money.

11:17.730 --> 11:19.598
That's why you're so eager
to get me out of here?

11:19.599 --> 11:21.099
You and Bear need
a ride to a concert?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.001
No!

11:23.002 --> 11:24.335
God, Ryan,

11:24.336 --> 11:26.370
how could you even think that?

11:26.371 --> 11:29.340
But you do know where the
Glen Helen Pavilion is, right?

11:29.341 --> 11:31.676
I'm such an idiot.

11:31.677 --> 11:33.411
You're the same self-serving,

11:33.412 --> 11:35.346
manipulative bastard
you always were.

11:35.347 --> 11:37.247
Ryan, you've got it all wrong.

11:37.248 --> 11:39.016
Will you let me explain?

11:39.017 --> 11:42.252
You don't know what it's
been like without you.

11:42.253 --> 11:44.688
I miss sitting on the couch,
ripping bingers

11:44.689 --> 11:46.390
and watching Matt Damon
DVDs.

11:46.391 --> 11:49.393
Ryan, please.

11:49.394 --> 11:51.963
I need you.

11:51.964 --> 11:54.232
What? You want
me to say it?

11:54.233 --> 11:57.301
Fine.

11:57.302 --> 12:00.438
Without you, I have no purpose.

12:00.439 --> 12:02.273
I'm nothing.

12:05.811 --> 12:07.478
It's like I don't even exist.

12:10.582 --> 12:14.184
I was good to you, Ryan.

12:14.185 --> 12:16.853
I helped you stand
on your own two feet,

12:16.854 --> 12:18.755
which is more than
I can do for myself.

12:18.756 --> 12:20.991
Look at me.
I'm a wreck.

12:20.992 --> 12:24.226
Crippled for life.

12:24.227 --> 12:27.763
And let's not forget how
and why I got hit by that car.

12:27.764 --> 12:32.601
You're using guilt
to manipulate me.

12:32.602 --> 12:35.738
I bet your legs are just fine.

12:35.739 --> 12:38.942
Like hell they are.

12:38.943 --> 12:40.243
Oh, yeah?

12:40.244 --> 12:42.413
Then what's this?

12:42.414 --> 12:44.849
I, uh, I've never
seen that before.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.518
Oh, so those aren't
your teeth marks?

12:46.519 --> 12:48.253
Oh, yeah, I remember.

12:48.254 --> 12:50.422
I may have been chewing
on that the other day.

12:50.423 --> 12:51.657
Chewing or chasing?

12:51.658 --> 12:52.825
Ow.

12:52.826 --> 12:55.160
Ryan, that hurt my heart.

12:55.161 --> 12:56.729
Why are you being like this?

12:56.730 --> 12:59.833
You want the frisbee?
You want it, Wilfred?

12:59.834 --> 13:01.868
No. You can keep it.

13:01.869 --> 13:04.303
Place it in the bin.
Don't throw it.

13:04.304 --> 13:05.538
You want it, huh?

13:05.539 --> 13:06.806
Ryan, please.

13:06.807 --> 13:08.007
I can't...
My legs, Ryan.

13:08.008 --> 13:09.208
- Come on, boy.
- I can't, okay?!

13:09.209 --> 13:10.542
(Whistling)
You want it?

13:10.543 --> 13:12.344
Why are you, why are
you being so cruel?!

13:12.345 --> 13:13.945
You want the frisbee?
You want me to throw it?

13:13.946 --> 13:15.079
Ryan, I'm begging you.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.214
You want it?
You want it?

13:16.215 --> 13:17.214
Yes, I want the frisbee!

13:17.215 --> 13:19.416
Go get it!

13:19.417 --> 13:20.784
Oh.

13:20.785 --> 13:22.119
- Frisbee!
- Looks like I was wrong.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.321
Looks like your legs
really are dead.

13:24.322 --> 13:27.525
Because otherwise,
you'd be able to feel this!

13:27.526 --> 13:28.893
- (People shouting)
- Frisbee!

13:28.894 --> 13:30.228
You like that
burning cigarette?

13:30.229 --> 13:31.229
- Can you feel it?!
- Frisbee! Frisbee!

13:31.230 --> 13:32.197
Stop it!

13:32.198 --> 13:34.032
What's your game, Wilfred?!

13:34.033 --> 13:36.969
No, no, no, no!
No, he's-he's faking it!

13:36.970 --> 13:38.337
I know he is!

13:38.338 --> 13:39.572
- Ryan!
- Frisbee!

13:39.573 --> 13:42.075
I forgive you, Ryan!

13:42.076 --> 13:44.477
Frisbee!

13:44.478 --> 13:46.979
(Thunder rumbling)

13:52.619 --> 13:55.186
I got to say, I'm disappointed.

13:55.187 --> 13:57.121
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean...

13:57.122 --> 13:59.790
The review board has approved
my recommendation to treat you

13:59.791 --> 14:01.659
with a more aggressive
form of therapy.

14:01.660 --> 14:02.593
Starting immediately.

14:04.896 --> 14:07.598
- Shock therapy?
- Electroconvulsive therapy.

14:07.599 --> 14:09.367
It's your best chance
to break through.

14:09.368 --> 14:11.002
I don't want to do this.
I want to go home.

14:12.772 --> 14:16.408
Unfortunately, that's
no longer an option.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.431
This treatment is like
a reset button for your brain.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.134
It'll be like the last
six months never happened.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.671
All the pain, all the questions
without answers...

14:31.672 --> 14:34.174
gone with the flip of a switch.

14:34.175 --> 14:35.742
You'll forget everything.

14:35.743 --> 14:38.145
Including Wilfred.

14:38.146 --> 14:40.348
He was right.
He was right.

14:40.349 --> 14:41.783
I didn't consent to this.

14:41.784 --> 14:43.685
You need my permission!

14:43.686 --> 14:46.187
We have a signed consent form
by your custodial guardian.

14:46.188 --> 14:47.722
My father?!

14:47.723 --> 14:49.090
He doesn't have the authority!

14:49.091 --> 14:50.257
You can't do this!

14:50.258 --> 14:52.593
Sedative.

14:52.594 --> 14:54.795
It's not your fault.

14:54.796 --> 14:58.431
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

14:58.432 --> 14:59.699
Wait.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.067
<i>That's from "Good Will Hunting".</i>

15:03.270 --> 15:06.906
- Holy shit! You're Robin Williams!
- Where's the goddamn sedative?!

15:09.143 --> 15:10.310
What the hell?
What are you doing?!

15:10.311 --> 15:11.244
Man:
Clear!

15:11.245 --> 15:12.779
Shazbot!

15:12.780 --> 15:15.015
We need to get out of here.

15:15.016 --> 15:16.216
Now!

15:16.217 --> 15:19.118
Come on!

15:25.659 --> 15:28.261
Go, go, go!

15:28.262 --> 15:29.095
Who are you?!

15:38.139 --> 15:39.106
Wilfred?!

15:39.107 --> 15:40.875
Woo-hoo! I'm back, baby!

15:40.876 --> 15:43.344
Wait. Where's your wheelchair?

15:43.345 --> 15:45.413
Really?
That's your first question?

15:45.414 --> 15:46.981
Wilfred!

15:46.982 --> 15:48.615
How did you get this van?

15:48.616 --> 15:49.683
We hot-china'd it.

15:49.684 --> 15:50.884
"We"?

15:50.885 --> 15:52.719
Bear?!

15:52.720 --> 15:53.987
(Tires screeching)
Jesus, Bear!

15:53.988 --> 15:55.555
(Car horn blaring)

15:55.556 --> 15:57.390
Keep your eye on the road!

15:57.391 --> 15:58.758
Wait.

15:58.759 --> 16:00.659
This is a dream.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.728
This is the dream!

16:02.729 --> 16:04.864
The office is real life!

16:04.865 --> 16:07.200
Yeah, but right now,
that life is a nightmare.

16:07.201 --> 16:10.337
You've walled yourself off
from your real life's work.

16:10.338 --> 16:14.075
You need to wake up, get down to
that basement and read my will!

16:14.076 --> 16:16.277
Bear! Watch out!

16:16.278 --> 16:19.380
No, Bear!
Pedal to the metal!

16:19.381 --> 16:22.251
You just have to believe
you can break through!

16:22.252 --> 16:24.186
(Both screaming)

16:26.623 --> 16:27.789
Man:
Ryan!

16:27.790 --> 16:29.324
You with us?

16:29.325 --> 16:31.760
Um, yeah.

16:35.097 --> 16:37.598
Guess I zoned out for a second.

16:37.599 --> 16:39.366
As I was saying,

16:39.367 --> 16:42.369
we've all been under
an extraordinary deadline.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.905
The past few weeks,
we've pushed ourselves

16:44.906 --> 16:47.874
to the very limits
of human endurance.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.609
We've worked
ridiculously long hours,

16:49.610 --> 16:51.077
depriving ourselves

16:51.078 --> 16:54.147
of the sleep and exercise
our bodies need.

16:54.148 --> 16:57.784
We've sacrificed time
with our families.

16:57.785 --> 16:58.718
We've sacrificed our health.

16:58.719 --> 17:00.086
(Gurgling)

17:00.087 --> 17:01.421
Kevin, seriously!
You need to get

17:01.422 --> 17:03.623
some antibiotics, okay?

17:03.624 --> 17:04.825
That's annoying.

17:04.826 --> 17:06.459
I have a call in to the doctor.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.261
Good. Frankly,
I'm surprised

17:08.262 --> 17:11.130
we all haven't gone
a little crazy.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.964
(Laughter)
And for what?

17:12.965 --> 17:15.066
It's not like we're finding
a cure for cancer.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.667
(Cell phone buzzing)
Oh, wait a second. Yes, we are!

17:16.669 --> 17:19.502
(Laughter)

17:19.503 --> 17:22.272
I mean, we've all
worked our asses off,

17:22.273 --> 17:25.375
especially Mr. Ryan Newman,
our in-house counsel,

17:25.376 --> 17:28.713
who today is going to file
an updated protocol

17:28.714 --> 17:32.217
with the FDA for the revised
clinical trial plans...

17:32.218 --> 17:33.184
And where you going?

17:33.185 --> 17:34.686
I have to go.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.488
The report is ready.
Stacey can file it.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.756
Yeah, but I still
have some questions.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.324
So do I.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.626
Sorry.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.395
(Phone ringing,
people chattering)

18:12.460 --> 18:13.994
That can wait.
That can wait.

18:13.995 --> 18:14.928
No!
(Squeals)

18:14.929 --> 18:17.898
(Both laugh)

18:21.936 --> 18:24.304
