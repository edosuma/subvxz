WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:07.308
Coconut flakes,
tuna pouch,

00:07.408 --> 00:08.742
raisins...

00:08.842 --> 00:12.113
Uh-uh, you are not taking tuna
on our road trip.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.515
I'd let you bring a tuna pouch
if I was going.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.616
But you're not.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.419
It's just me, Harper and Brooke.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.089
We're gonna have girls' weekend.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.657
Normally I would remind you that
we are women, not girls,

00:23.757 --> 00:25.593
but I plan on drinking
a pink margarita

00:25.693 --> 00:27.728
in a tiara, so you're good.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.197
What kind of pink
we talking about?

00:29.297 --> 00:31.499
Strawberry? Hibiscus?
Pink peppercorn?

00:31.599 --> 00:34.001
What? I've been on tons
of girls' trips.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.204
They're way better than
guys' trips.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.139
They're organized,
they're indoors,

00:38.239 --> 00:40.941
and nobody teases you if you
want to drink some rosé.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.912
[BOTH]:
Rosé!

00:45.012 --> 00:46.314
I can't wait.

00:46.414 --> 00:49.717
I'm finally gonna go
on my first girls' trip.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.385
I was living in Italy,
and apparently women there

00:51.485 --> 00:53.154
don't go on girls' trips.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.188
'Cause they're in Italy.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.623
When I got back,

00:55.723 --> 00:57.091
I just never found
my group of girls.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.026
It was like all the groups
were already taken.

00:59.127 --> 01:03.164
Well, we're putting together
a new group, okay?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.065
The cool, fashionable one.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.734
The smart, sexy one.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.536
The beautiful, spontaneous one.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.971
And you and Brooke.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.306
Do I know Brooke?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.007
Oh, no. We were
roommates in college.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.178
She is amazing. Yes.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.079
But let's hurry so we can
beat that bitch there

01:19.180 --> 01:21.349
before she takes the good bed.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.617
Actually, big surprise.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.353
Since they found out
I'm iCarly,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.355
they upgraded us
to the party suite.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.290
-Ooh!
-All I have to do is post

01:29.390 --> 01:30.991
a video of us having
a fun time.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.495
Which is perfect because
I make videos and you're fun.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.264
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.666
Mini birdhouse delivery.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.135
Oh, good, we really
needed a seventh.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.537
I know I've been making a lot,
but this one's got

01:43.637 --> 01:45.105
gold leaf wallpaper
on the inside.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.108
I say this as someone
who needs a girlfriend.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.910
You need a girlfriend.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.346
Ah, I really do.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.914
I'm sick of just dating
fun women

01:54.014 --> 01:56.116
who love sports
and brew their own beer

01:56.217 --> 01:57.351
and don't want to commit.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.320
I want something more
than that.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.223
I'd be good with... that.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.858
Oh! Inspiration has struck.

02:04.958 --> 02:09.397
Birdhouses for people.
Yeah!

02:10.864 --> 02:14.768
Ugh, Spencer's life
makes me so sad.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.104
I'm over it.
Girls' trip!

02:17.205 --> 02:18.606
Yay, you guys!

02:18.706 --> 02:21.475
Aw, Freddie, you know what
could be fun for you?

02:21.575 --> 02:22.910
Get the bags.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.414
Nothing is gonna stop us
from having fun.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.418
-Oh, my God.
-Hi, Harp.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.853
Maeve?
[shrieks]

02:32.953 --> 02:34.322
Oh, my God!

02:34.422 --> 02:37.625
Maeve? Your cousin who
disappeared four years ago?

02:37.725 --> 02:39.793
[laughing]
Oh, my God.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.331
No, probably a different one.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.665
* I know *

02:44.765 --> 02:46.133
* You see *

02:46.234 --> 02:48.669
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:48.769 --> 02:51.739
* And be so wonderful *

02:51.839 --> 02:55.509
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

02:55.609 --> 02:57.711
* It's your time to be *

02:57.811 --> 03:00.748
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

03:00.848 --> 03:03.451
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

03:03.551 --> 03:06.720
* Of every situation *

03:06.820 --> 03:08.656
* Some things are meant to be *

03:08.756 --> 03:12.092
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me. *

03:13.461 --> 03:15.929
So, after four years
at sea,

03:16.029 --> 03:18.632
my kidnappers finally decided
to let me go.

03:18.732 --> 03:22.336
Wait, so were they kidnappers
or pirates?

03:22.436 --> 03:24.505
-I'm super into pirates.
-Freddie's super into pirates.

03:24.605 --> 03:28.075
I just love the word
"swashbuckle."

03:28.175 --> 03:29.877
You'd love it a lot less

03:29.977 --> 03:33.247
if you were the one
being swashed and buckled.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.249
Oh, poor Maeve.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.917
Well, the good news is
I'm not mad at you

03:37.017 --> 03:39.052
for ghosting me anymore.
[chuckles]

03:39.152 --> 03:41.054
You should probably not
read my emails.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.657
None of that matters.
The important thing is

03:43.757 --> 03:46.360
is that I'm here now,
and I'm never traveling

03:46.460 --> 03:48.329
anywhere ever again.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.931
I just want to sit here
with my favorite person.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.535
Well, hey, why don't you come
with us on our girls' trip?

03:54.635 --> 03:57.705
We can sit in the car, and we
can sit in the party suite.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.139
We can sit a bunch of places.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.943
The thought of taking
even a single step...

04:03.043 --> 04:06.280
makes my throat close
from stress.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.583
I mean, this sea water
usually calms me down.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.985
It's not working now, though.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.555
Harper, you and Maeve
should just stay here.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.124
Don't worry about me.
Brooke's gonna be there.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.093
[phones chime]

04:20.193 --> 04:21.194
And Brooke can't go.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.464
Oh, no.
Her car was stolen?!

04:23.564 --> 04:26.099
Poor Brooke.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.568
Look, I'll be okay.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.503
I have all sorts of fun ideas.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.104
I heard they have
a Tupperware museum,

04:31.204 --> 04:33.641
and I just got a book
about candles.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.343
Girl trip!

04:35.443 --> 04:36.544
Ooh...

04:36.644 --> 04:39.212
Freddie, be packed
in five minutes.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.783
This isn't gonna be awkward

04:42.883 --> 04:45.386
-with us sharing a room, is it?
-Why would it be?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.721
* *

04:49.457 --> 04:52.259
This isn't the party suite.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.963
No, it is.
"Party of two.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.600
An intimate experience
for lovers in love."

04:59.700 --> 05:01.735
Wow, comes with
a couples massage

05:01.835 --> 05:04.204
with five flavors of lotion.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.277
I'll, uh, call the front desk
and have them

05:10.378 --> 05:12.112
switch our room to something
with a little less

05:12.212 --> 05:14.682
pheromones.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.283
[line ringing]

05:17.418 --> 05:18.819
A chocolate drawer?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.821
Freddie, you put that phone down
right now.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.760
[both laughing]

05:26.860 --> 05:28.328
Okay, cousin catch-up time.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.663
-Just me and you.
-Yes. Yes.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.165
Ooh, I'm thirstier
than a Kardashian

05:32.265 --> 05:33.434
at All-Star Weekend.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.735
You need anything to drink?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.871
Oh, do you have Sardinian
peach nectar?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.707
A glass of water's fine.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.712
Harper, what are you doing here?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.380
What are you doing here?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.715
I have a key.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.417
Spencer is supposed to be
babysitting me,

05:49.517 --> 05:52.052
but I use this place for me time
when you and Carly aren't here.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.286
We know this.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.288
No, we don't know this.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.758
Who are you?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.360
Oh, hi, I'm Maeve.
I'm Harper's cousin.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.597
The Harper's cousin?
You resurfaced?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.065
I have.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.635
And I'm so happy to be back
with Harper again.

06:07.735 --> 06:11.304
-Is this tap?
-You'll be fine.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.908
And I'm so happy, too.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.478
Almost as happy as when
we had Christmas in August.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.213
Yes. And my dad shipped in
all that real snow

06:20.313 --> 06:21.782
from Switzerland because he said
it had a...

06:21.882 --> 06:23.050
[BOTH]:
...better crunch.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.786
-[laughs]
-Aw, that's sweet.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.555
My dad got me a fish
named Donut.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.824
It was on sale because
it doesn't swim very fast.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.228
Maeve, I've missed you
so much.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.329
I know.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.631
And now that you're back,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.800
I'll never let anyone
take you away.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.970
Millicent, what is
taking you so long?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.404
You're just supposed
to steal the cookies

06:44.505 --> 06:45.839
and come right back.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.542
Well, hello.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.311
-I'm Spencer.
-I'm Maeve.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.581
I'm Harper's cousin
that was kidnapped

06:53.681 --> 06:54.948
and taken to sea.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.116
-Oh.
-So nice to meet you.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.318
-Oh, gee! Oh, my dear.
-Ooh.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.890
I, uh, I guess I haven't gotten
my land legs yet.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.793
Well, lucky for me
I got to catch you.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.196
-Yeah, thank you.
-You've had such an ordeal.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.499
Yeah, I try to look
on the bright side.

07:11.599 --> 07:15.669
I saw a lot of the world
when I wasn't blindfolded.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.772
Wow, your attitude is
so refreshing.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.142
You know what else
is refreshing?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.179
[shudders]

07:27.915 --> 07:29.717
Is that from the Adriatic?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.519
Yes. Excellent nose.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.521
[both laugh]

07:33.621 --> 07:36.056
Yeah, okay.
This was fun.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.758
But we haven't seen each other
in a really long time,

07:37.858 --> 07:40.494
and I skipped the girls' trip
so we could catch up, so...

07:40.594 --> 07:41.629
[laughs] Bye.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.463
You can still go
on the trip.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.698
I'll entertain Maeve for you.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.466
Uh, no, you're not
gonna do that

07:46.567 --> 07:48.769
because she's here
to be with me, so...

07:48.869 --> 07:51.138
Harper, did you make this?

07:51.238 --> 07:53.073
No, I didn't make
that tacky thing.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.509
And it's way too small to fit
an actual bird.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.511
Well, that's what
I love about it.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.480
Actually, um...
[chuckles]

08:00.581 --> 08:01.849
I made it.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.051
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.453
Those hands are pure genius.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.756
And the gold leaf wallpaper
reminds me

08:08.856 --> 08:10.724
of the Melk Abbey in Austria.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.325
Well, you know what they say.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.662
If it ain't Baroque,
don't fix it.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.896
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.232
I think your cousin
ba-roke Spencer.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.703
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.772
Look at us.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.140
Girls'-trippin',
champagne sippin'

08:27.240 --> 08:29.309
and chocolate drawer dippin'.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.410
Oh.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.114
And I brought something
for you.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.918
-Aw, Freddie. Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.722
"My Way or the Rosé."

08:41.822 --> 08:44.424
Aw, I'm never gonna wear this.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.359
I gotta hand it to you,
though.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.096
This girls' trip is off
to a great start.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.699
Shall we look at
my itinerary?

08:51.799 --> 08:54.101
"Gossip on the drive here."
Check.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.536
"Freak out over how great
the room is." Check.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.272
"Look in all the drawers for
weird stuff people left behind."

08:59.372 --> 09:00.473
Checking!

09:03.977 --> 09:05.579
I wonder what this does.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.580
[sexy music playing]

09:06.680 --> 09:07.981
* Ooh, honey *

09:08.081 --> 09:10.217
* Come here to me *

09:10.317 --> 09:11.819
* Let's take a walk
amongst the blossoming... *

09:11.919 --> 09:13.687
I-I like this song.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.056
Mm, I like it, too.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.158
It's great for lots of
occasions.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.027
* Go to cooking class *

09:20.127 --> 09:24.431
* I want to have s-s-s-sex *

09:24.531 --> 09:27.467
* With you, baby *

09:27.567 --> 09:28.769
* Mm... *

09:28.869 --> 09:30.037
Is this weird?

09:30.137 --> 09:32.305
[scoffs]
Not at all.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.110
You know what?
Who says you can't share

09:37.210 --> 09:39.546
a honeymoon suite
with your platonic best friend

09:39.647 --> 09:42.783
with whom you have a complicated
romantic history?

09:42.883 --> 09:45.185
No one says that.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.987
You know what?
You take the bed.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.090
It's so fancy it'll ruin me
for all future beds.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.661
Oh, my God.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.428
This bed is so comfortable.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.230
Freddie, you gotta come
try this.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.465
At least for a few minutes
before you mess up your back

09:58.565 --> 10:00.901
-sleeping on that couch.
-All right.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.602
* *

10:02.703 --> 10:04.071
Oh, yeah.

10:04.171 --> 10:07.374
[loudly]
Oh, yeah!

10:07.474 --> 10:09.643
-This feels so good.
-Ooh.

10:09.743 --> 10:13.246
You know what, I'm doing it.
I'm going in.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.281
Come on.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.283
* I want to have... *

10:16.383 --> 10:19.186
-Oh!
-That is incredible.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.155
[FREDDIE]:
Oh, so good.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.858
Fun Brooke is here.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.593
Let's get this party star--

10:26.694 --> 10:31.832
Oh. Looks like the party
already started. Rrr!

10:31.932 --> 10:35.235
-No, no. I mean, we're not.
-No.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.938
I-I mean, we were.
Not like were were.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.841
Then we weren't.
Let me just turn this off.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.042
[button clicks]

10:42.142 --> 10:45.278
* With you, baby *

10:46.179 --> 10:47.948
* I want to have *

10:48.048 --> 10:49.449
* S-s-s-sex. *

10:54.454 --> 10:55.689
I see you already got
your cocktail.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.057
Yeah, I found it on a tray
in the hall.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.592
I guess they just
leave them out for people.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.129
I'm just so happy
that you made it.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.597
Yay. Me, too.
[chuckles]

11:04.698 --> 11:06.333
Did they find your car?

11:06.433 --> 11:08.401
No, I did.
So it turns out

11:08.501 --> 11:09.903
it wasn't actually stolen.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.972
I just forgot
where I parked it.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.306
[chuckles]

11:13.406 --> 11:16.176
I am a total hot mess.
Isn't that cute, though?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.610
Adorable.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.313
Are you sure
I'm not interrupting something?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.015
-No.
-No, not at all.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.417
-You're exactly what we needed.
-Yeah, the more the merrier.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.620
Yay. Girls' trip,
plus a cute guy.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.891
-And now a cute girl.
-Uh, hello?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.392
[gasps]

11:32.492 --> 11:34.895
Sorry, I'm a hugger.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.830
We're gonna have
a really good time.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.398
Okay... oh!

11:38.498 --> 11:39.599
And me.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.168
I'm here, too.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.338
Maeve, you're
the most thoughtful person.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.140
You let me cook for you,
serve you,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.442
you even let me rub your feet.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.111
Well, if you play
your cards right,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.512
I'll let you feed me dessert.

11:52.612 --> 11:53.947
-Oh...
-[laughs]

11:55.348 --> 11:57.384
I got Chinese, DVDs

11:57.484 --> 11:58.819
and a stuffed Maltese.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.154
You know, in case you need
a comfort object.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.923
Y'all ate already?

12:03.023 --> 12:06.493
Oh, yeah, I told Spencer how
much I was missing the ocean,

12:06.593 --> 12:09.496
and he surprised me
with my favorite dinner.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.499
An Alaskan crab leg buffet.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.836
You should've seen how adorable
she was cracking those legs.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.138
Yeah, cute.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.207
But I thought Chinese was
your favorite food.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.741
Since when do you like crab?

12:21.842 --> 12:23.543
Since I spent four years at sea.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.079
Plus my kidnappers were
very anti-gluten,

12:26.179 --> 12:28.782
so I kind of
don't do Chinese anymore.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.150
Well, that makes sense.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.719
But you still
like action movies, right?

12:32.820 --> 12:35.022
'Cause I got Takens
one through three.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.190
Ooh, I shouldn't have gotten
Takens one through three.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.759
Yeah, I've had
enough action/adventure

12:39.860 --> 12:41.728
in my real life, you know,

12:41.829 --> 12:44.031
so these days, I'm more into...

12:44.131 --> 12:45.198
-Romance?
-Yes.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.900
[SPENCER]:
It's funny

12:47.000 --> 12:48.836
you should mention
romance movies and the sea,

12:48.936 --> 12:50.703
because I have
another surprise for you.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.275
Spencer, this is amazing!

12:55.375 --> 12:57.710
Well, there is one more thing,
but I don't know,

12:57.811 --> 12:59.179
maybe it's over-the-top.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.514
Well, we wouldn't want that.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.817
May I sketch you?

13:03.917 --> 13:07.220
Are we about to live out
my Titanic fantasy?

13:07.320 --> 13:10.757
Y'all know how
that movie ends, right?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.194
Okay.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.196
Oh, should we make a toast?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.430
Yes.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.332
To Brooke,
for getting her car back

13:19.432 --> 13:20.868
so she can be here.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.035
Aw.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.236
And to Freddie,

13:23.336 --> 13:25.839
for making such a sweet toast.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.908
-And to me, for...
-[knocking]

13:28.008 --> 13:30.844
...getting the door.
[chuckles]

13:32.712 --> 13:34.481
Couples massage.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.150
Oh, this is
a little awkward, but...

13:37.250 --> 13:38.651
there are three of us.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.120
I can't believe I'm saying this,

13:40.220 --> 13:41.588
but maybe we should pass.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.690
Actually,
I have a lot of tension

13:43.790 --> 13:45.859
from my car almost being stolen.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.760
I could really use a massage.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.997
I'll get undressed.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.132
Yeah, me, too!

14:00.273 --> 14:03.110
Oh, hey, there's a carnival
in town this weekend.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.644
Should we go?

14:04.744 --> 14:07.180
[BOTH]:
[moaning] Oh, yeah!

14:09.049 --> 14:10.717
Wait, what are you
saying yeah to?

14:10.817 --> 14:12.452
The carnival or the massage?

14:12.552 --> 14:14.888
[BOTH]:
[moaning] Oh, yeah!

14:14.988 --> 14:17.324
-Oh... yeah.
-Oh...

14:17.424 --> 14:19.792
Yeah, that clears it up.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.796
Oh, my God, did I eat all these?

14:24.764 --> 14:27.100
Damn, this is well-crafted.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.671
Give me your key.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.774
Fine. I have
three other points of entry.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.676
What happened to your cousin?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.211
She get kidnapped again?

14:38.311 --> 14:39.779
Yeah, by Spencer.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.148
Wait, what are you doing?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.250
You want to watch movies
with bad words?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.018
I can't. I'm only here

14:45.118 --> 14:47.687
because I left my checkbook.
It's probably in my desk.

14:47.787 --> 14:48.922
That's not your desk!

14:49.022 --> 14:52.159
Then why is my checkbook in it?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.162
Olive and I are about to go
protest the froyo shop.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.630
They stopped carrying
rainbow sprinkles,

14:57.730 --> 15:00.533
and we're not gonna
take this lying down.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.971
-Now you're third-wheeling me,
too? -Oh!

15:04.071 --> 15:06.673
You're not a third wheel--
you were never invited at all.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.008
Bye-ee!

15:08.108 --> 15:10.843
-[door closes]
-I'm never having kids.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.381
[laughs] Ah!

15:14.481 --> 15:17.250
I'm so glad we ventured out--
that carnival was a blast.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.786
It was... something.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.355
I was just in awe

15:22.455 --> 15:25.358
of how you were able to win
this unicorn for me.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.826
What can I say?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.462
I'm incredibly good
at ring toss.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.231
So, uh...

15:31.331 --> 15:34.501
do you have any thoughts on
what you'd like to do tonight?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.536
I do have a few ideas.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.871
-Huh.
-I do, too! Actually...

15:38.972 --> 15:40.974
I was hoping to check out
the tiki bar in the lobby.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.876
I need some alcohol
to absorb all that chocolate.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.646
Great idea, Carly.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.348
Here, take this wad of cash.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.517
Have so much fun, okay?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.485
Let us know how it is. Bye!

15:52.585 --> 15:53.886
[mouthing]

15:58.891 --> 15:59.892
Thank you, Snoqualmie Suites

15:59.993 --> 16:01.428
for hooking us up this weekend!

16:01.528 --> 16:03.530
My friends and I are
having so much fun

16:03.630 --> 16:07.000
all together
in the same place right now.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.802
What now?
Okay, yeah, I'm coming.

16:09.902 --> 16:13.606
I guess it's my turn
to dance on the bar.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.508
Got to go.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.047
Another Lonely Lady?

16:20.147 --> 16:22.882
I mean, I'm alone,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.651
but I'm not "lonely."

16:24.751 --> 16:27.087
I mean, sure, I got ditched
on my girls' trip

16:27.187 --> 16:28.588
because I brought
my best guy friend

16:28.688 --> 16:31.091
-and apparently he brought
his A-game, but-- -No.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.459
That's the name of your drink.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.894
Do you want another Lonely Lady?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.163
Oh.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.165
Yes, please.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.601
[chuckles]

16:41.701 --> 16:43.103
[phone ringing]

16:43.203 --> 16:44.537
Hey, Harper.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.207
-How's it going? Bad.
-How's it going? Bad.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.076
You first, so I can top you

16:49.176 --> 16:50.677
with how amazingly awful
my thing is.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.545
[over phone]:
Okay, try this.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.947
Freddie and Brooke are getting
couples' massages,

16:55.048 --> 16:58.285
winning unicorns and hooking up
in the honeymoon suite

16:58.385 --> 17:00.420
while I'm drinking
a drink for losers.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.223
That drink looks good though.
I'm gonna make one.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.491
What's in it?

17:04.591 --> 17:07.627
Aperol, vermouth, and amaro.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.930
-Do we have those? -We have
warm white wine and vodka.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.665
Close enough.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.067
Ooh!

17:14.167 --> 17:16.603
Virtual girls' trip!

17:17.770 --> 17:19.772
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

17:19.872 --> 17:21.908
Okay, out-depress me.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.110
If you think you can.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.677
Maeve ditched me for Spencer.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.347
Maeve ditched me
for sexual purposes

17:27.447 --> 17:29.282
with Spencer.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.284
I wish there were any way

17:31.384 --> 17:33.420
I could be misinterpreting this.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.588
Should I just come home?

17:35.688 --> 17:37.857
No, it's your girls' trip!

17:37.957 --> 17:39.926
Go up there!
Freddie needs to learn

17:40.026 --> 17:41.894
that it's besties before testes!

17:41.994 --> 17:44.264
Yeah. You know what?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.765
You do that, too.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.801
Tell Maeve
it's cousins before "huggins."

17:48.901 --> 17:50.937
Not as good, but yeah!

17:52.905 --> 17:54.941
[groans]

17:56.042 --> 17:58.878
Okay, that's it.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.248
I'm sick of you two having
all the fun without me.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.350
Can I uncover my eyes?

18:03.450 --> 18:04.951
[FREDDIE]:
It's getting pretty intimate.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.119
We're playing MASH.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.255
I hope I get mansion.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.089
I love that game.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.524
Please, will you do me, too?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.193
I'll do both of you.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.861
-Be right back.
-Great.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.364
[exhales]

18:18.531 --> 18:20.233
What are you doing here?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.601
I was trying
to get some alone time.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.170
Oh, you want some alone time?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.272
Try going on a trip with you.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.974
You're right, I'm sorry.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.676
I ditched you. It's just...

18:29.776 --> 18:32.145
ever since I got divorced,
the second time,

18:32.245 --> 18:34.281
also the first time,
but mostly the second time,

18:34.381 --> 18:38.117
I just felt like I'm never gonna
meet someone who's right for me.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.852
You feel that way
about Brooke?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.354
I don't know, maybe.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.456
It's fun making out with her.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.892
Fair enough.

18:45.992 --> 18:49.028
I just wish I got to make out
with someone, too.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.630
Ding dong.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.233
I might be able
to help you with that.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.403
You know, it took me a minute,
but I think I finally get

18:56.503 --> 18:58.438
what you two have
been trying to tell me.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.373
The honeymoon suite,

19:00.473 --> 19:03.443
the massage, Harper conveniently

19:03.543 --> 19:05.945
not being able to come
at the last minute.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.347
Not to mention

19:07.447 --> 19:09.549
the obvious sexual tension

19:09.649 --> 19:11.284
between me and Carly.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.053
The which what?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.257
You want Hot Mess Brooke

19:17.357 --> 19:20.660
for a hot messy threesome.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.762
-Oh, I don't think...
-Let's hear the woman out.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.998
Okay, I say
we just jump right in.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.701
You know, because rules
and boundaries,

19:28.801 --> 19:31.170
they make everything so blah.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.572
Brooke, we...

19:32.672 --> 19:34.741
we're not trying to have
a threesome with you.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.643
Oh, God.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.712
Why does
this keep happening to me?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.949
First at that funeral
and then at the DMV.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.452
I'm just gonna grab
another drink

19:45.552 --> 19:48.721
from the hallway and go home.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.026
Do either of you know
where I parked my car?

19:54.126 --> 19:55.695
No?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.164
Okay, I'll just walk around

19:58.265 --> 20:00.400
and listen for the "boop, boop."

20:01.167 --> 20:03.002
Bye.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.004
[both laugh]

20:05.104 --> 20:07.740
-Our girls' trip was
a bust, huh? -Yeah.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.976
I got ditched, drank alone,

20:10.076 --> 20:12.178
ruined your hook-up,
started an argument

20:12.279 --> 20:14.180
and then Brooke went home early.

20:14.281 --> 20:17.417
Yep. Sounds like every
girls' trip I've ever been on.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.319
Oh. Yay, I did it.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.853
Ha, ha!

20:20.953 --> 20:23.423
Ah, I wonder why she thought
we'd be into a threesome?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.091
Yeah, it was so out of the blue.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.693
Right?

20:26.793 --> 20:29.128
[sighs]

20:29.228 --> 20:31.564
-Should I get a separate room?
-Yeah, definitely.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.205
[moans]

20:39.306 --> 20:42.875
And that's why you don't mix
white wine with vodka.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.112
Did I learn nothing in college?

20:46.212 --> 20:48.214
Ahoy.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.482
Dim sum?

20:49.582 --> 20:50.617
What about the gluten?

20:50.717 --> 20:52.952
Sundays were always cheat days.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.221
I really missed you.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.789
I missed you more.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.459
And, look, you know,
I'm happy that you and Spencer

20:59.559 --> 21:01.127
-are getting along so...
-Mm-mm, mm-mm.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.796
You're the person I missed
the most while I was gone,

21:03.896 --> 21:05.798
and you're the person
I'm most excited

21:05.898 --> 21:07.867
to spend time with
now that I'm back.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.303
Aw, you're my number one girl.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.004
Yeah.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.443
Oh, and there's
my other number one girl.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.777
Don't make fun of my shirt.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.212
I got chocolate
on all my other ones.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.449
Oh, look at us all together.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.517
I'm finally here
with my "best friend

21:24.617 --> 21:26.319
unless my cousin
ever resurfaces"

21:26.419 --> 21:28.455
and my cousin who resurfaced!

21:28.555 --> 21:30.222
You two are gonna
love each other.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.258
But just as friends, right?

21:32.359 --> 21:34.827
Oh, did Brooke try a threesome?

21:34.927 --> 21:37.029
[HARPER]:
I heard she's good.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.798
You should've done it.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.401
We're here
for the girls' brunch!

21:41.501 --> 21:42.802
What is with you men?

21:42.902 --> 21:44.504
Can we have anything
to ourselves?

21:44.604 --> 21:45.738
Freddie said he was coming.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.273
Oh, he earned his spot.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.875
King of the girls' trip!

21:50.109 --> 21:52.479
Hey, Harper,
can I borrow your phone?

21:52.579 --> 21:53.746
Sure. Why?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.648
I'm not a dim sum person.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.484
I'm ordering a pizza.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.018
This is fun.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.787
You know, we should make
this a regular thing.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.690
Which is going to be
a lot easier

22:03.790 --> 22:06.759
because... I'm dropping anchor
in Seattle.

22:06.859 --> 22:07.894
-Really?
-That's great.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.261
-You can stay with us.
-Mm-hmm.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.530
I'll make you a key.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.831
Thank you.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.232
Uh, actually,
she's gonna stay with me.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.501
Now what now?

22:14.601 --> 22:15.902
Oh, just while I look
for a place.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.605
Or... who knows?

22:18.705 --> 22:21.674
* *

22:23.643 --> 22:24.944
[CARLY]:
Wow.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.046
I missed a lot
on that girls' trip.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.448
So did I.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.317
And I was here the whole time.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.352
Stop!

22:33.453 --> 22:38.290
* Ooh, honey *

22:38.391 --> 22:40.026
* Come here to me *

22:40.126 --> 22:44.564
* Let's take a walk amongst
the blossoming cherry tress *

22:44.664 --> 22:46.065
* Ooh, sugar *

22:46.165 --> 22:48.200
* I could talk for hours *

22:48.300 --> 22:50.269
* Go to a cooking class *

22:50.369 --> 22:52.939
* Take in your mental prowess *

22:53.039 --> 22:55.141
* S-s-s-sex *

22:55.241 --> 22:58.411
* With you, baby *

22:58.511 --> 23:00.346
* Mm. *

23:01.981 --> 23:04.183
Ooh.
