01:44.145 --> 01:46.105
I'm headed your way.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.357
Coran, no!

01:47.440 --> 01:49.109
The Castle of Lions barely survived

01:49.192 --> 01:52.403
the first time we fought one of
those ships. You'll only--

01:53.696 --> 01:57.242
Keith is right, Coran,
the ship's defenses will never hold!

01:57.325 --> 02:01.454
-We can't take this much longer!
-Do you guys have any ideas?

02:02.413 --> 02:04.958
Coran,
fire just below our position.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.209
What?

02:06.292 --> 02:09.128
Destroy the rock
we're pinned against. Now!

02:18.721 --> 02:21.558
Lance! Pidge!
I need you to get us some cover.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.725
-Right!
-On it.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.323
Who's got eyes on Shiro?

03:00.263 --> 03:02.307
What just happened?

03:02.390 --> 03:03.266
Is that...?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.020
A wormhole?

03:07.103 --> 03:08.855
They're trying to escape.

03:08.938 --> 03:09.856
Haggar.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.858
It has to be Haggar.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.736
She must have gained the ability. But how?

03:14.819 --> 03:18.489
We can't worry about that.
We have to make sure we get Shiro back.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.034
But Shiro's not Shiro anymore.

03:21.117 --> 03:26.873
I know, but something is wrong with him.
The Galra or Lotor have to be behind it.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.961
You all know he would never give up on us.
We can't give up on him.

03:48.811 --> 03:52.899
Guys, one of my thrusters
is down. Can you compensate?

03:52.982 --> 03:56.527
Those beams torched our power core.
I've never seen anything like it.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.864
We've got maybe 30 seconds
of over-clocked burn time.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.282
Hit it!

04:05.745 --> 04:07.497
We're halfway through
our burn.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.415
25%...

04:11.417 --> 04:12.710
15%...

04:15.421 --> 04:16.589
8%!

04:16.673 --> 04:19.341
- We're not going to make it!
- Too heavy!

04:20.176 --> 04:21.928
- Disband.
- What?

04:22.011 --> 04:24.389
Energy from disconnecting
might create enough thrust

04:24.472 --> 04:26.015
to propel me through the wormhole.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.268
You'll be the only one
on the other side.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.769
Do it!

05:03.594 --> 05:06.222
All right, gotta play this smart.

05:14.897 --> 05:18.109
-Wow. I can't believe he made it.
-I'll take him out.

05:18.192 --> 05:22.947
No. You two escort the package back
to Honerva. I'll take care of this one.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.526
Zethrid. Ezor.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.465
We'll take it from here.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.101
Um...

06:34.477 --> 06:35.561
Is it broken?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.940
Just leave it. We've got orders.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.734
Ezor!

06:42.318 --> 06:43.319
Coming.

06:51.202 --> 06:55.998
You are to lead the Black Lion away
from the fleet. Is that understood?

06:57.291 --> 07:00.586
Yes. But how am I to lure them away?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.714
The Red Paladin's connection
to you runs deep.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.175
Deeper than the others.

07:06.259 --> 07:13.099
He believes there is good left inside you,
which leaves him vulnerable to persuasion.

07:13.182 --> 07:16.185
You will exploit this weakness.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.396
I understand.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.358
Think.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.236
Think. How are we gonna get in there?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.825
Shiro.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.744
Shiro, come in. I know you're there!

07:36.414 --> 07:40.084
I don't know what's wrong,
but I know we can fix this.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.252
Let me help you.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.675
All ships, dock immediately,
prepare for hyper-jump.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.353
I know you're hurting.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.190
We just need to keep it together
a little longer.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.326
Okay, all the Lions are in their hangars

08:13.409 --> 08:15.745
and their power cores appear
to be recharging.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.873
Structurally speaking,
the Lions are at about 60%.

08:18.956 --> 08:22.001
Whatever those ships hit them with,
really did some damage.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.295
Any luck yet, Princess?

08:24.378 --> 08:27.381
No. I'm afraid not.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.675
I fear that the wormhole
may have deposited them

08:29.759 --> 08:31.427
beyond my ability's reach.

08:31.511 --> 08:35.556
I'll try to contact some coalition forces
to provide assistance. Hmm?

08:36.765 --> 08:39.101
- Whoa.
- Coran, what's happening?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.607
It appears the Castle's systems
are shutting down one by one.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.442
As though someone hacked into the ship

08:46.526 --> 08:48.694
and let loose a "kill" protocol
of some sort.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.238
Have you tried an override?

08:50.321 --> 08:52.573
Or maybe counteracting it
with a "live" protocol?

08:52.657 --> 08:53.824
Is that a thing?

08:53.908 --> 08:57.745
-The virus is moving too fast.
-Okay, I'm in the system.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.748
Subroutines eight through 19
have me completely locked out.

09:00.831 --> 09:03.876
But if I can skip ahead to--
Come on, come on, come on.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.129
Spectra generator down.
Stabilizers are down.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.298
Main turbine also down.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.217
Crystal matrix offline!

09:11.801 --> 09:14.053
Particle barrier generator down!

09:14.136 --> 09:17.807
There! I've got it isolated.
Now I just have to lock it down

09:17.890 --> 09:20.309
with a multi-layered
tri-tetragonal quarantine.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.227
And...

09:21.811 --> 09:24.021
Almost...

09:24.897 --> 09:26.774
Ha! Yes!

09:30.361 --> 09:31.487
Well done, Pidge.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.701
What? How?

09:38.494 --> 09:42.290
The virus has countermeasures
that specifically targeted my quarantine!

09:42.373 --> 09:44.667
It's like... it knew.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.638
If this shuts down
the teludav's mass regulator,

09:57.722 --> 10:00.558
the ship, along with everything
in the neighboring subsystem,

10:00.641 --> 10:01.767
would be destroyed.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.355
- Uh, where are you going?
- No time!

10:22.496 --> 10:23.873
Prince Lotor.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.627
My son.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.598
The anger you feel toward me
is to be expected.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.310
But understand
that the events that transformed me

10:44.393 --> 10:46.103
into the witch Haggar

10:46.187 --> 10:50.358
also shrouded any glimmer
of maternal instinct I may have had

10:50.441 --> 10:52.610
for my one and only child.

10:52.693 --> 10:57.031
However, you've continued the work
I started all that time ago

10:57.114 --> 11:01.869
and have indeed seen it through
to heights I could have only imagined.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.872
Your never-ending pursuit
of knowledge is truly--

11:04.955 --> 11:05.956
Enough.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.920
My mother ceased to exist
when Honerva drew her last breath.

11:11.003 --> 11:15.466
Do not believe for a moment
that I would ever accept you as kin.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.927
You are an abomination.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.889
A twisted perversion
of what was once so pure and beautiful.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.769
The end is near, witch.
I know you can sense it.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.354
If you beg for your life now,

11:28.437 --> 11:31.732
maybe I will take pity on you
when the time comes.

11:37.321 --> 11:38.781
Take him away.

11:52.086 --> 11:55.131
-Did you just kill her?
-Are you working with Lotor?

11:57.133 --> 12:00.553
I can explain everything,
but I assure you she is not dead.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.890
If you're with me, we need to get
to the Sincline ships and leave now.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.894
-Um, sure?
-We're good.

12:08.978 --> 12:09.812
Right, then.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.690
We're headed for the Castle of Lions'
last known location.

12:12.773 --> 12:16.444
Sir, the wormhole deposited us
on the far side of the Thizonian system.

12:16.527 --> 12:20.489
We need to make multiple hyperspace jumps
and even then, it will take some time.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.616
Then what are we waiting for?

14:03.842 --> 14:05.094
Hello, Keith.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.053
Huh?

14:13.435 --> 14:15.271
Pidge, what have you discovered?

14:15.854 --> 14:19.066
Protocol's countermeasure.
I recognized it.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.860
Recognized it? How?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.612
From the code I scanned from Shiro's arm

14:23.696 --> 14:26.073
while we were looking
for Galra installations.

14:26.657 --> 14:30.244
Wait. Are you saying Shiro is responsible
for this?

14:31.328 --> 14:32.288
Yes.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.003
Shiro, it's gonna be okay.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.880
Yes, I know.

14:40.963 --> 14:46.468
-We just have to get back to the Castle.
-We are not going anywhere!

15:21.128 --> 15:23.172
The teludav,

15:23.255 --> 15:25.299
it's reaching critical mass.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.635
Pidge!

15:28.719 --> 15:30.220
I know, I know.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.939
This thing's about to blow any second.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.381
Uh, Pidge,
how did you do that?

16:07.299 --> 16:12.388
When I was scanning Shiro's arm,
I also made a copy of its programming.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.933
I created a virus that could terminate
all its command prompts,

16:16.016 --> 16:18.394
in case something like this
ever happened.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.817
I never thought I'd have to use it.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.819
That's the Keith I remember.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.923
Shiro, I know you're in there.

17:30.507 --> 17:34.845
You made a promise once.
You told me you'd never give up on me.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.599
And I should have abandoned you
just like your parents did.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.769
They saw that you were broken. Worthless.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.772
I should have seen it, too.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.899
I'm not leaving here without you.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.820
Actually, neither of us are leaving.

18:08.837 --> 18:09.838
Shiro!

19:52.024 --> 19:53.692
Shiro, please.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.153
You're my brother.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.488
I love you.

20:00.699 --> 20:05.245
Just let go, Keith.
You don't have to fight anymore.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.415
By now, the team's already gone.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.876
I saw to it myself.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.467
Aah!

20:31.647 --> 20:32.481
Keith...

22:09.328 --> 22:12.664
The only reason this kid is here
is because you vouched for him.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.000
You need to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.253
Understood. I'll handle it.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.557
-Hey.
-Look, I know I messed up.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.476
You should send me back
to the home already.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.770
This place isn't for me.

22:34.853 --> 22:39.524
Keith, you can do this.
I will never give up on you.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.570
But more importantly,
you can't give up on yourself.
