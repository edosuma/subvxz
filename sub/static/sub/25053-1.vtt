If you hadn't been
suspended already,

reason to expel you for good.

Wait, how old are you?

16:18.144 --> 16:21.210
and the house is sealed up and I'm gonna

16:21.212 --> 16:23.909
We can't leave that boy

- Girl, you showing your panties. What's the matter with you?

17:02.345 --> 17:04.108

Don't fuck with her!

17:23.345 --> 17:26.309
- Come on, man. Drop it!
- Get off me!

17:26.310 --> 17:27.443
Any kid can lay down
on the street,

17:27.444 --> 17:28.942
but you pick him
and bring him home.

17:28.944 --> 17:31.110
This one is... This one is crazy.

17:31.112 --> 17:34.109
Go away from me.

Now we can't get anything
out of him.

17:53.844 --> 17:56.710

- What did you say?

17:56.712 --> 18:00.409

- Yeah.

18:02.844 --> 18:04.277
Yeah.

18:04.279 --> 18:07.244
You let your kids run wild. I
should call Social Services on you.

18:07.246 --> 18:08.510
How about that?

18:08.512 --> 18:11.109
- I got a rifle too.
- Oh, pull the fucking trigger Kenny.

18:11.111 --> 18:12.913
Get in the car. Now!

18:14.346 --> 18:16.110
Come on. Let's go.

18:16.112 --> 18:17.843
Let's go.

18:17.845 --> 18:19.709
Oh. That's nice.

18:19.711 --> 18:22.143
Real fucking nice.

18:22.145 --> 18:24.610
Call your mama. If you want to,
I don't give a shit.

18:24.612 --> 18:26.012
White guy in the neighborhood!

18:28.911 --> 18:31.444
Bye, loser!

18:48.546 --> 18:50.543
Hey, Millie, how you doing?

18:50.545 --> 18:51.912
Hey.

18:52.612 --> 18:54.076
<i>The LAPD officer</i>

18:54.078 --> 18:56.775
<i>who delivered the most baton
blows to Rodney King,</i>

18:56.777 --> 19:00.210
<i>using the video tape
and police audio transmission,</i>

19:00.212 --> 19:03.776
<i>prosecutors claim Powell was
laughing after the beating...</i>

19:03.778 --> 19:06.177
<i>...and asked
us questions about Latasha.</i>

19:06.179 --> 19:12.413
<i>They refused to show us the picture of
her on the floor bleeding to death.</i>

19:13.311 --> 19:14.977
Come on! Let's go!

19:14.979 --> 19:17.276
<i>He puts his foot down
and he's thrown off balance.</i>

19:17.278 --> 19:19.476
<i>Mr. Briseno is thrown
off balance.</i>

19:19.478 --> 19:23.443
<i>Mr. White says this is a stomp,
an unnecessary stomp.</i>

19:23.445 --> 19:25.842
<i>He used his left foot,
his weak foot,</i>

19:25.844 --> 19:29.042
<i>not like Mr. Wind,
he used his weak foot.</i>

19:29.044 --> 19:32.243
<i>He's right-footed. How...</i>

19:32.245 --> 19:34.544
<i>is Officer Briseno
to stop this beating?</i>

19:34.546 --> 19:36.142
<i>How's he supposed to do that?</i>

19:36.144 --> 19:40.577
<i>He's supposed to do that by
his foot instead of his hand.</i>

19:40.579 --> 19:44.343
<i>He's gotta keep his head
out of the strike zone.</i>

19:44.345 --> 19:47.409
Describe the action or the verb
in a sentence.

19:47.411 --> 19:49.444
Okay, now, what's a verb?

19:49.446 --> 19:52.843
A verb is the action
in a sentence.

19:52.845 --> 19:56.810
<i>If he's trying to harm Mr. King,
would he use his weak foot?</i>

19:56.812 --> 19:58.710
<i>If he's trying
to harm Mr. King?</i>

19:58.712 --> 20:02.043
<i>Would he do that if his purpose
was to apply unnecessary force?</i>

20:02.045 --> 20:03.846
<i>That's all.</i>

20:10.145 --> 20:12.376
Go back to your house.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.477
Get back inside! Inside!

20:14.479 --> 20:16.343
Hey! Out of here!

20:16.345 --> 20:18.176
Anybody!

20:18.178 --> 20:19.577
Turn that lawyer off!

20:19.579 --> 20:23.110
We got one white boy in the
neighborhood and he's losing his mind.

20:23.112 --> 20:26.646
<i>Did he go? Did he kick him like
a professional football player?</i>

20:27.578 --> 20:29.046
Get back
in the house, Sir.

20:31.246 --> 20:34.009
<i>Not like Mr. Wind,
he used his weak foot...</i>

20:34.011 --> 20:36.010
- What are you doing?
- The cops say anything not to go to jail.

20:36.012 --> 20:39.578
I promise you they're going to jail.
It's all on tape.

20:41.612 --> 20:45.209
- What's the matter, are you afraid of him?
- Of course he's a fraid of him.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.510
Mean motherfucker!

20:50.011 --> 20:51.709
Get back in the house!

20:51.711 --> 20:55.143
Back it up!
Yeah, I can make noise!

20:55.145 --> 20:57.309
Push! Push!

20:57.311 --> 20:59.376
Hold on! Here!

20:59.378 --> 21:02.043
Oh, my God!

21:02.045 --> 21:03.810
He threw and destroyed it!

21:03.812 --> 21:06.542
You see that?
That's a barricade!

21:06.544 --> 21:08.009
Stop it or it's your ass.

21:14.079 --> 21:15.643
No! No! No!

21:21.179 --> 21:22.812
Hey, Jess.

21:23.844 --> 21:25.576
- What?
- Give me a minute.

21:25.578 --> 21:26.811
Jessie.

21:39.045 --> 21:42.775
Hey, you. What are you doing
there? What are you doing?

21:42.777 --> 21:45.243
- Nothing.
- You're not stealing that stuff, are you?

21:45.245 --> 21:46.811
Nobody would steal this.

21:49.078 --> 21:51.076
Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:51.078 --> 21:52.876
Stop! You come back here.

21:52.878 --> 21:56.742
Oh, never. Not in this life or in any life.
This is a workplace in hell.

21:56.744 --> 21:58.743
You bring back whatever
you stole from there.

21:58.745 --> 22:01.446
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- So we got a Soon Jan Do here?

22:02.211 --> 22:04.042
Soon Ja what?

22:04.044 --> 22:06.042
You touch a hair on that girl, I swear
to god you're not going home tonight.

22:06.044 --> 22:09.343
Yeah. I'm with them.
Okay? Don't come after me.

22:09.345 --> 22:10.845
They're angry.

22:17.877 --> 22:20.010
- Thank you.
- So you with us?

22:20.012 --> 22:21.475
- Yeah, I am.
- I'm Matt.

22:21.477 --> 22:23.277
- I'm Nicole.
- Care for a drink?

22:23.279 --> 22:24.646
Sure.

22:28.312 --> 22:30.909
Now we aren't gonna put
anything in these?

22:30.911 --> 22:32.343
So I better have some more.

22:32.345 --> 22:34.509
No, babe, you calm down now.
This is just whiskey.

22:34.511 --> 22:36.476
Hey, but they're not putting
anything in it these days.

22:36.478 --> 22:37.977
Whiskey makes me crazy.

22:37.979 --> 22:41.077
Oh there's nothing wrong with
whiskey's making you crazy.

22:41.079 --> 22:42.443
Yeah, what's with all the bags?

22:42.445 --> 22:44.210
This is everything I own.

22:44.212 --> 22:45.977
What the hell doing here
with everything you own?

22:45.979 --> 22:49.443
I was hoping to get killed but
that hadn't happened yet, so...

22:49.445 --> 22:51.646
So you don't have a place
to stay?

22:53.012 --> 22:54.776
I got a friend of a friend.

22:54.778 --> 22:58.779
Said he'd let me stay in his
broom closet but I don't know.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.542
- You're beautiful.
- Yeah.

23:01.544 --> 23:04.910
- She's a real pretty girl, man.
- Man, she's marvelous.

23:04.912 --> 23:08.142
I mean, come on. Look at you.
Look at those lips.

23:08.144 --> 23:09.578
Look at me.

23:12.245 --> 23:13.643
Did you like that?

23:13.645 --> 23:16.642
- She's like a kid, man.
- No, she's a little woman.

23:16.644 --> 23:17.943
Come on, man. Knock this off.

23:17.945 --> 23:20.576
Come on, man. Back off.
She's enjoying it.

23:20.578 --> 23:24.711
Right? Well, you know
you'll drive any man crazy.

23:26.445 --> 23:27.913
How about this?

23:28.477 --> 23:30.243
Wanna take a ride?

23:30.245 --> 23:33.176
What do you say?
You can stay at my place.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.945
Come here.
Let me tell you something.

23:37.045 --> 23:38.876
I'm gonna take you home.

23:38.878 --> 23:41.846
And you gonna show me
that round ass,

23:42.877 --> 23:45.244
those brand new breasts.

23:45.246 --> 23:47.077
And I'm gonna fuck you.

23:47.079 --> 23:49.509
And you're gonna love it.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.610
And you're gonna wrap
your legs around me.

23:52.612 --> 23:55.076
I'm gonna fuck you over

23:55.078 --> 23:57.678
and over and over again.

23:58.777 --> 23:59.876
You want that, right?

23:59.878 --> 24:02.742
- Don't even doubt.
- Let's go somewhere.

24:02.744 --> 24:04.909
- Come on, man.
- You need a bath.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.244
What?

24:06.246 --> 24:07.943
You're a real big ugly shit,
you know?

24:07.945 --> 24:10.542
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- You bitch!

24:10.544 --> 24:12.742
Oh, so now I'm bitch.
A minute ago,

24:12.744 --> 24:15.443
- you're heading for sex, you fucking pig.
- Motherfucker!

24:19.111 --> 24:20.609
You shut up, okay?

24:20.611 --> 24:23.977
Oh, pervert! Come here!

24:23.979 --> 24:26.576
Come here! I'll beat
the shit out of you.

24:26.578 --> 24:28.675
Are you out of your mind?

24:28.677 --> 24:31.442
You can't even grab
a little girl.

24:31.444 --> 24:32.910
- Fuck you!
- Hey.

24:32.912 --> 24:35.043
No guts, huh? No balls?

24:35.045 --> 24:37.509
- I bet you're not having a dick.
- Nigger, is she crazy?

24:39.545 --> 24:41.875
Who the fuck you are talking to?

24:41.877 --> 24:46.276
- You lucky. Fuck you, bitch!
- Get the hell out of it here.

24:46.278 --> 24:49.311
I'll see you.
I'll see you.

24:50.778 --> 24:52.845
Get out of here!

24:55.645 --> 24:57.243
You know why
I pulled you over, sir?

24:57.245 --> 24:59.345
Where did all my friends go?

25:02.577 --> 25:05.309
The guys with the whiskey.

25:05.311 --> 25:08.675
- Come on. Let's go.
- It's the third time I got pulled over tonight.

25:08.677 --> 25:11.508
I don't even have a light out.
What's the matter?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.209
Sir, your license, please?

25:13.211 --> 25:15.443
I got trailed on a freeway.
I pulled over.

25:15.445 --> 25:19.176
You guys already wrote me up and some
squad stops me down on Normandy.

25:19.178 --> 25:20.476
I'm not drunk.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.009
What are you doing?

25:22.011 --> 25:24.976
You gotta stop it. You
wanna get yourself killed?

25:24.978 --> 25:29.343
I need a place to stay
and I'm tired, okay?

25:29.345 --> 25:32.508
Close the door,
it's cold out there.

25:32.510 --> 25:37.010
Fine. Suit yourself. Move over.

25:37.012 --> 25:40.578
What I like is a little respect
for an officer of the law.

25:43.012 --> 25:45.509
Hey, hey, whoa, easy now.

25:45.511 --> 25:48.676
You sure you wanna sit
in their car? Come on.

25:48.678 --> 25:51.009
- Let's get out of here.
- No, it's not safe for me out there.

25:51.011 --> 25:53.309
- You're driving me nuts.
- Then you get out of here.

25:53.311 --> 25:55.010
I'm gonna stay right here.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.643
And I'm gonna wait to get clubbed,
that's what we're here for, right?

25:56.645 --> 25:59.775
Easy, stay right there. What the
hell is going on back here?

25:59.777 --> 26:01.642
- Where you going?
- Am I not allowed in jail?

26:01.644 --> 26:03.809
Prison, juvenile home,
whatever you got.

26:03.811 --> 26:07.242
I'm giving myself up,
I stole in the store.

26:07.244 --> 26:09.409
We decide who goes
to the station.

26:10.812 --> 26:13.010
Hey! Goddamn it! Hey!

26:13.012 --> 26:16.209
Both of you shut up!
Everybody shut up right now!

26:16.211 --> 26:17.575
God, I hate this fucking job.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.810
- Please, I shop-lifted.
- I don't give a shit.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.842
There are laws against that.
I need to be taken away.

26:22.844 --> 26:24.343
I need to be taken away.

26:24.345 --> 26:26.776
- You cracked me.
- Stay back. Sir?

26:26.778 --> 26:29.909
What if my windshield wipers
does not function properly?

26:29.911 --> 26:32.710
Sir. Get back in there!

26:32.712 --> 26:34.977
Goddamn it. Get the fuck out
of my car.

26:34.979 --> 26:37.642
- Please, please, no.
- Why don't you understand?

26:37.644 --> 26:41.208
Get out. You too, fuck face.
Come on!

26:41.210 --> 26:42.643
Listen to me. Listen.

26:42.645 --> 26:44.910
Both of you get out of here now.
Do you understand me?

26:44.912 --> 26:48.243
Go home. Do not come back.
Is that clear?

26:48.245 --> 26:51.077
Hey, buddy. Hey, whoa, whoa,
what the hell!

26:51.079 --> 26:53.012
What? Get out of your car!

27:05.577 --> 27:07.376
Where you been, lover boy?

27:07.378 --> 27:08.909
Out fucking?

27:08.911 --> 27:12.276
See, I know you was out fucking. I
got a way to knowing this shit.

27:12.278 --> 27:14.543
I never had whiskey before.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.545
- That's what she drink?
- Just shut up!

27:30.311 --> 27:32.875
Jesus Christ! The goddess
is showing.

27:32.877 --> 27:33.910
Man, get out of here.

27:33.912 --> 27:35.642
She looks good. I wanna keep
looking at her.

27:35.644 --> 27:37.711
She's knocked out.
Had too much alcohol.

28:30.744 --> 28:32.045
Hi.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.478
Hi.

28:36.878 --> 28:39.311
How the hell did I get here?

28:40.310 --> 28:41.745
You don't remember?

28:43.577 --> 28:44.845
No.

28:45.911 --> 28:47.809
The last thing I remember,

28:47.811 --> 28:50.910
I was standing in the street,
looking at the moon.

28:50.912 --> 28:55.013
It was a big moon. I'd never
seen a bigger moon.

28:55.945 --> 28:58.809
And I remember you.

29:15.311 --> 29:17.076
Where's Millie?

29:17.078 --> 29:18.276
She's out delivering cakes

29:18.278 --> 29:19.610
or cutting somebody's hair,

29:19.612 --> 29:22.141
or swinging a mop somewhere.
We're still starving.

29:22.143 --> 29:25.475
Look. Look at this. These kids
are always ready for food.

29:25.477 --> 29:27.675
Man, forget that. Now, we
have a problem.

29:27.677 --> 29:30.243
Millie's too stupid to steal
and we gotta do something.

29:30.245 --> 29:32.909
We're gonna go to the supermarket and
we're gonna take everything we want.

29:32.911 --> 29:35.342
So when you are in the supermarket,
if they catch you stealing,

29:35.344 --> 29:37.710
they can only approach you
when you're out the mall.

29:37.712 --> 29:40.479
- Okay.
- Kids, this is Nicole.

29:45.177 --> 29:47.543
Okay, all right, you all,
listen to me.

29:47.545 --> 29:51.042
This stroller is a perfect tool
for shoplifting.

29:51.044 --> 29:52.379
Quiet!

29:58.678 --> 30:02.642
Okay. The apartment is empty
as long as William's mom's gone.

30:02.644 --> 30:04.376
You can come
and go as you please.

30:04.378 --> 30:06.375
But you're gonna have to use
the side window.

30:06.377 --> 30:07.846
The front door's still shut.

30:08.411 --> 30:10.476
Come, I'll drop you.

30:10.478 --> 30:12.876
You all right?

30:15.144 --> 30:16.846
You can spit on the floor here.

30:29.111 --> 30:31.345
Oh, God. What is this?

30:54.578 --> 30:57.442
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold this.

30:57.444 --> 30:58.944
Keep the cheese.

30:59.510 --> 31:01.411
It's too big.

31:06.845 --> 31:09.141
Stay in line. Get in line.

31:09.143 --> 31:10.812
Stay right here.

31:38.378 --> 31:40.479
Run!

31:45.143 --> 31:46.275
Oh!

31:46.277 --> 31:48.411
Can anybody give
some barnacles?

31:49.011 --> 31:51.009
We're out of it?

32:00.244 --> 32:02.343
You want chips
and taco?

32:04.943 --> 32:07.311
Thank you.

32:10.043 --> 32:12.845
Mmm! God I love chicken.

32:14.245 --> 32:15.975
And I love eating.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.478
You want a milk shake?

32:18.511 --> 32:19.378
Yeah?

32:23.111 --> 32:27.841
<i>The case that won't
go away due to an argument...</i>

32:27.843 --> 32:31.242
- Here's you ten.
- <i>...a surveillance camera captured the...</i>

32:31.244 --> 32:33.109
Kids, come here. Santa's home!

32:39.744 --> 32:41.409
Did you steal this?

32:41.411 --> 32:43.676
- No!
- Oh, my God.

32:43.678 --> 32:46.809
It's from Santa.

32:50.244 --> 32:51.575
Jessie.

32:51.577 --> 32:54.775
Some son of a bitch sneaked
in here and stole the toilet.

32:54.777 --> 32:55.911
What?

32:58.144 --> 32:59.609
How did they do that?

32:59.611 --> 33:02.909
It doesn't have a lock on it
and it's just two screws.

33:17.345 --> 33:19.479
The world may never know.

33:32.077 --> 33:35.108
<i>In Los Angeles,
to recall a judge</i>

33:35.110 --> 33:38.808
<i>because of a controversial decision
in the killing of a teenager.</i>

33:38.810 --> 33:42.610
<i>Judge Joyce Karlin still argues
that Du is no criminal.</i>

33:42.612 --> 33:46.041
<i>I know a criminal
when I see one.</i>

33:46.043 --> 33:50.944
<i>I know a person who presents a danger
to the community when I see one.</i>

34:35.612 --> 34:38.342
Hey! Wait one goddamn minute.

34:38.344 --> 34:42.643
Where'd you get that?
Get your own toilet!

34:42.645 --> 34:45.176
- Hey, William.
- Hey, come on.

34:45.178 --> 34:47.444
- I got it.
- You got it?

34:50.311 --> 34:51.676
- Okay.
- Yeah.

34:51.678 --> 34:53.511
The guy was just walking around.

35:01.810 --> 35:04.841
<i>And then at 3:52,
watch what you see,</i>

35:04.843 --> 35:09.141
<i>at 3:52, you see Mr. King
still moving,</i>

35:09.143 --> 35:12.376
<i>far higher than
a push-off position.</i>

35:12.378 --> 35:15.342
<i>Coming around,
his head comes around.</i>

35:15.344 --> 35:18.774
<i>You see Tim Wind appeared
to start a swing</i>

35:18.776 --> 35:25.874
<i>and as Mr. King's head is coming
into that area of swing...</i>

35:25.876 --> 35:29.675
He's saying that Rodney King
hit a baton with his face?

35:29.677 --> 35:31.442
May I see it?

35:31.444 --> 35:33.476
I'll call you on that.

35:33.478 --> 35:35.708
Think he's something now.
He got a gun.

35:35.710 --> 35:38.344
Dude, you think
he hot shit now.

35:41.477 --> 35:44.045
- Nice baby. I love this.
- Hey, hey.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.311
Give me the gun.

35:47.310 --> 35:50.243
And you and Nicole,
just drop it.

35:55.545 --> 35:57.175
Why don't we gun down
Soon Ja Du?

35:57.177 --> 36:00.677
Why does everybody in
town want that Soon Du's ass?

36:01.310 --> 36:03.312
You new to Los Angeles?

36:03.711 --> 36:05.377
Soon Ja Du,

36:05.379 --> 36:08.512
killed that girl Latasha for going to the
liquor store to get herself some orange juice.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.312
Do you wanna take
some orange juice?

36:14.143 --> 36:15.012
What?

36:17.144 --> 36:18.409
Man, what the fuck!

36:18.411 --> 36:19.875
Latasha died right there.

36:19.877 --> 36:22.108
Man, I swear to God, one day, you're
gonna put a bullet in my heart,

36:22.110 --> 36:24.641
- and while I'll be laying down dying...
- Cheer up, won't happen again.

36:24.643 --> 36:26.542
Now, we four against
killer Soon Ja Du.

36:26.544 --> 36:28.443
I was thinking about shooting
her. What do you think, man?

36:28.445 --> 36:30.375
Best thing we do
in any situation.

36:30.377 --> 36:32.844
- Let's do what you wanna do.
- I wanna shoot her.

36:33.611 --> 36:34.908
Why not?

36:34.910 --> 36:36.577
I don't know.

36:37.610 --> 36:39.142
You let me know when you know.

36:39.144 --> 36:40.841
What kind of shit
you all are on?

36:40.843 --> 36:41.976
You don't kill people.

36:41.978 --> 36:44.674
- You don't even talk about it.
- Why not?

36:44.676 --> 36:46.674
Soon Ja Du blew that girl's
brains out.

36:46.676 --> 36:49.175
Right now, she's lazing around
feeding ducks at parks.

36:49.177 --> 36:50.909
Wait, that woman
didn't go to jail?

36:50.911 --> 36:51.975
No, she didn't.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.808
- No shit?
- No shit.

36:53.810 --> 36:55.443
The judge said jail
would harm her.

36:55.445 --> 36:57.475
We do something, we go
straight to jail.

36:57.477 --> 36:59.209
Hell, they try to put us
under the jail.

36:59.211 --> 37:00.774
- So you in?
- No, she's not.

37:00.776 --> 37:03.176
- Killing in against the law.
- Anything interesting is.

37:03.178 --> 37:04.609
- Be serious.
- I am.

37:04.611 --> 37:05.941
Latasha's life had
a meaning.

37:05.943 --> 37:07.741
If you kill someone,
that'll be the worst fuck up.

37:07.743 --> 37:09.942
Yeah, take it easy. We shouldn't
blow anybody's brains out.

37:09.944 --> 37:12.675
- Listen to her.
- But I could blow her shop up for you.

37:12.677 --> 37:15.741
You just give me a bottle, some gas,
a tampon and boom. No more shop.

37:15.743 --> 37:17.541
- No.
- Will you give me a place to stay?

37:17.543 --> 37:19.442
You don't say shit like that.

37:19.444 --> 37:20.641
Have you lost
your goddamn mind?

37:20.643 --> 37:22.276
- Will do when nobody's in.
- No!

37:22.278 --> 37:24.309
Or I could still break those men
in half for you.

37:29.776 --> 37:31.344
I can't leave it.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.744
What's that?

37:48.510 --> 37:49.745
No!

37:55.677 --> 37:57.379
You just wait.

38:02.445 --> 38:05.108
- What's the plan?
- To stay the fuck alive.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.641
We're putting
all their tires down.

38:06.643 --> 38:08.009
The plan is to break
everything you can.

38:08.011 --> 38:10.141
My masterplan was to live
at least till the year 2000.

38:10.143 --> 38:11.909
I gotta reshape it.
Fuck that guy.

38:11.911 --> 38:14.012
That's a very nice thing to tell
Nicole but she hasn't fucked me yet.

38:22.211 --> 38:24.279
Come on. Get in there.

38:26.044 --> 38:28.474
- What's this?
- Let's do with your cell phone.

38:28.476 --> 38:30.675
- Shit, man, give me that. You good?
- Yeah.

38:30.677 --> 38:31.710
Grab that knife.

38:45.244 --> 38:47.710
- I want us out of here.
- Let me do this.

38:48.210 --> 38:50.975
Let me do this!

38:50.977 --> 38:53.578
- Fine.
- William.

38:55.211 --> 38:57.909
Run! Run! Run!

39:00.378 --> 39:01.745
They're gonna shoot us.

39:26.644 --> 39:29.209
- Take him to the hospital?
- He got shot.

39:29.211 --> 39:30.475
He got shot?

39:30.477 --> 39:31.978
Yes, he did. He got hit.

39:33.543 --> 39:35.243
William's in there
praying for death.

39:35.245 --> 39:37.441
- He got hit.
- Shut the fuck up.

39:37.443 --> 39:40.311
Look, man, William
got grazed by a bullet.

39:42.744 --> 39:44.678
I didn't get him out of earshot.

39:48.711 --> 39:49.945
How you doing?

39:50.977 --> 39:53.411
- Not well.
- Show me.

39:58.676 --> 40:01.642
- Does it hurt?
- Just a little bit.

40:01.644 --> 40:05.209
Now rock your toes
back and forth.

40:05.211 --> 40:07.942
- Better now?
- Just regular.

40:07.944 --> 40:09.610
Bleeding a little.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.841
- You good?
- Come on.

40:14.843 --> 40:16.377
Stop it.

40:17.310 --> 40:18.942
It's gonna hurt.

40:18.944 --> 40:20.474
It was the stupidest plan.

40:20.476 --> 40:22.941
Wasn't even a plan?
Raid a police station?

40:22.943 --> 40:24.308
Idiots!

40:24.310 --> 40:28.575
Man, it's eye for an eye. You
push me, I'mma push you back.

40:28.577 --> 40:31.742
It's death. I'm bleeding to death.

40:31.744 --> 40:34.444
- Look, Nicole
- Stop it, you're still a baby.

40:36.077 --> 40:37.908
Shit, man. It hurts.

40:37.910 --> 40:39.674
Fuck, this hurts bad.

40:39.676 --> 40:41.275
We should probably get you
to a hospital.

40:41.277 --> 40:42.642
I don't need no damn hospital.

40:42.644 --> 40:45.075
All right. Die here.
See if we'll give a shit.

40:55.143 --> 40:58.775
<i>The jury is still out on the
case against four Los Angeles police men</i>

40:58.777 --> 41:01.242
<i>charged in the beating
of motorist Rodney King.</i>

41:01.244 --> 41:03.008
<i>It's the sixth day...</i>

41:03.010 --> 41:06.243
<i>Not only for the
defendants is the suspense unpleasant,</i>

41:06.245 --> 41:10.375

41:22.510 --> 41:27.809
Quiet.

41:27.811 --> 41:30.511
- It's time to come in.
- We're playing.

41:35.544 --> 41:37.978
<i>...only to be told
"no verdict."</i>

41:41.710 --> 41:44.742
<i>A lot. We're just
hoping for a good result.</i>

41:46.177 --> 41:49.142
Boys, your dinner
is getting cold.

41:49.144 --> 41:52.242
Can you please come in here
and help me set the table?

41:52.244 --> 41:54.708
We're almost done.

41:57.676 --> 41:59.942
Lady! Hey! Lady!

41:59.944 --> 42:02.642
I'm trying to work. If you
can't get them to shut up,

42:02.644 --> 42:04.941
we're gonna have
an all-out brawl.

42:04.943 --> 42:08.343
Look. You don't start nothing.
There won't be nothing.

42:10.243 --> 42:11.577
Thank you.

42:14.777 --> 42:15.808
No, no.

42:15.810 --> 42:17.778
Let me handle it.

42:25.244 --> 42:28.611
Hmm. Thought you all wanted
to play.

42:29.244 --> 42:30.475
We're finished.

42:30.477 --> 42:33.742
But I called you in,
three times.

42:33.744 --> 42:35.274
But you all said
you wanted to play.

42:35.276 --> 42:38.608
- Well, now you all can play till the sun comes up.
- No, wait.

42:38.610 --> 42:41.842
No, wait. Millie, no!

42:41.844 --> 42:45.242
- Let us in!
- It's just gonna be for a minute.

42:45.244 --> 42:47.809
Teach their little butts
a lesson.

42:56.210 --> 42:57.845
Boys?

43:04.110 --> 43:05.478
Boys!

43:06.010 --> 43:08.775
They're hiding.

43:08.777 --> 43:11.874
<i>Again, the issue
of racism has been introduced.</i>

43:11.876 --> 43:15.774
<i>The prosecutor asked Powell about a
message he had sent to another officer</i>

43:15.776 --> 43:19.075
<i>just before King incident on his
patrol car's computer terminal,</i>

43:19.077 --> 43:22.841
<i>referring to his previous call which
involved a group of African Americans,</i>

43:22.843 --> 43:26.274
<i>Powell typed, "It was right
out of</i> Gorillas in the Mist."

43:26.276 --> 43:30.241
<i>The prosecutor also hammered away at the
meaning behind another computer message</i>

43:30.243 --> 43:32.809
<i>sent by Powell
after King was in custody.</i>

43:32.811 --> 43:35.808
<i>Powell communicating again
with the same officer typed,</i>

43:35.810 --> 43:39.574
<i>"Oops, I haven't beaten anyone
this bad in a long time."</i>

43:39.576 --> 43:42.341
All right. Come on. Come on.
Come on.

43:42.343 --> 43:44.642
This is not that bad.
I mean...

43:44.644 --> 43:46.641
You know, it's not the end
of the world.

43:46.643 --> 43:49.009
When someone shut the door
on you, see if you don't cry.

43:49.011 --> 43:52.641
Sure. Okay. Let's have a look
what's on the television.

43:52.643 --> 43:54.342
Let's see what's on here.

43:54.344 --> 43:56.778
Hmm. Right.

43:57.310 --> 43:58.878
Who's hungry?

43:59.877 --> 44:01.710
Anybody hungry?

44:02.743 --> 44:05.675
What we got? We got
beets, we got carrots

44:05.677 --> 44:07.508
and we got...

44:07.510 --> 44:09.374
<i>The prosecutor pushed...</i>

44:09.376 --> 44:10.675
- Shit!
- <i>Let me guess.</i>

44:10.677 --> 44:13.908
Okay. You won't like that.
We don't need that.

44:13.910 --> 44:17.911
Let's get some cartoons here
or something.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.811
Right.

44:27.142 --> 44:28.909
Who wants pizza?

44:28.911 --> 44:31.575
- Yeah, I wrote all of this.
- I already like this one.

44:31.577 --> 44:33.877
There was...

44:34.876 --> 44:36.809
- Purple.
- What?

44:36.811 --> 44:38.975
- Purple.
- Purple?

44:38.977 --> 44:41.042

Oh, my God.

45:49.042 --> 45:50.342
Oh, God.

45:50.344 --> 45:52.508
I was looking all over for you.

45:52.510 --> 45:54.809
Why did you leave the backyard?

45:54.811 --> 45:57.976
Told you, never leave
the backyard.

45:57.978 --> 45:59.478
We're sorry, Mommy.

46:04.576 --> 46:08.010
What? You're gonna call
Social Services on me?

46:10.476 --> 46:11.678
No.

47:17.577 --> 47:20.845
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

47:24.376 --> 47:28.845
Whisper something
sweet in my ears.

47:44.876 --> 47:49.174
- Tell me you love it.
- I love it.

47:49.176 --> 47:53.742
I love it.

47:53.744 --> 47:56.408
- Come back to me, baby.
- Millie.

47:57.677 --> 47:59.940
- This is a dream.
- What?

47:59.942 --> 48:01.441
What the hell?

48:01.443 --> 48:03.408
- This is just a dream.
- This is not a dream.

48:03.410 --> 48:05.375
- May be.
- You are mine.

48:05.377 --> 48:07.442

- You're mine.

- You...

Can I have some milk, please?

48:36.943 --> 48:39.310
<i>Tell me you love it.</i>

48:49.177 --> 48:51.443

50:24.309 --> 50:26.241
There's some heavy shit
going down on the Havens.

with a gun? Where?

50:57.310 --> 50:59.040
They are after some kids.

50:59.042 --> 51:01.740

- Oh, Jessie.

51:01.742 --> 51:04.040

Did we miss the fun?

51:04.042 --> 51:05.675
No, no, back inside, boys.
Come on.

51:05.677 --> 51:08.442

I don't want you outside.

51:08.444 --> 51:10.841

51:25.344 --> 51:27.608
My boys! They're taking my boys.

51:27.610 --> 51:30.308
We didn't do nothing.
We didn't do nothing now.

51:30.310 --> 51:32.977
Take them down.
Watch your head.

51:37.611 --> 51:40.307
Why are you
doing this, Officer?

51:40.309 --> 51:42.873
You gonna kill me?

51:42.875 --> 51:45.407
Officer, he said
he didn't do it.

51:45.409 --> 51:48.408
I'm the wrong man.
I didn't do nothing.

51:48.410 --> 51:51.140
You don't have
to hurt him.

51:59.176 --> 52:01.010

Something is going on.

52:36.510 --> 52:40.809
He didn't do nothing.
He didn't do nothing.

52:41.642 --> 52:44.477
This is wrong. This is wrong.

52:47.743 --> 52:50.043
...innocent people.

52:51.243 --> 52:54.575
No! No! No!

53:12.676 --> 53:16.207

53:16.209 --> 53:18.873
I wanna take care
of my boys.

53:18.875 --> 53:21.407

- Get her in the car. Get her in.

53:58.377 --> 54:01.808
We ain't afraid.
We got guns just like you.

54:01.810 --> 54:04.375
Let us out!

54:04.377 --> 54:07.475
They want justice? I'm going

Get dressed. Let's go.

54:21.609 --> 54:25.840
Don't go.

55:37.277 --> 55:39.641
Hold there. There's someone.

55:39.643 --> 55:42.441
You're dragging a man
on the back of a car.

55:42.443 --> 55:46.075
Oh! Oh, God!

55:46.077 --> 55:48.744
Oh, lord Jesus!

55:49.709 --> 55:51.809
Let him go. What does he have
to do with this?

55:52.909 --> 55:57.607
Please, William,
don't hurt him.

55:57.609 --> 56:02.876
Please, please, please, please!

56:22.475 --> 56:26.277
Stop... Please...
William... What did you...

56:27.009 --> 56:29.409
Hey, William. William.

56:33.043 --> 56:35.911
Somebody, help! Help!

56:37.209 --> 56:40.041
He's hurting too much.

56:40.043 --> 56:41.907
- Fuck!
- We have to drop him.

56:41.909 --> 56:44.075
Just put him down.

56:44.077 --> 56:47.406
Nicole, press him.
Press the wound.

56:47.408 --> 56:50.010
Press here, right?

56:51.642 --> 56:55.242
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna get you home.

57:13.177 --> 57:15.340
<i>I want everybody out now.</i>

57:15.342 --> 57:17.674
Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop.

57:17.676 --> 57:20.674
What are you doing?
Now put that out.

57:20.676 --> 57:23.074
- Screw you!
- Put that out!

57:23.076 --> 57:24.540
Put that out!

Oh, God, in hell.

Hey, stop, stop!

58:09.910 --> 58:11.442
Shit!

58:18.308 --> 58:21.274
28th and Griffith, all right?

58:21.276 --> 58:23.841
All right. We're waiting.
Thank you.

58:23.843 --> 58:25.607
Hey, stop. Stop!

58:25.609 --> 58:27.709
Wait!

58:33.110 --> 58:35.641
My God in heaven.

58:35.643 --> 58:39.510
Ruben, Tiger, come downstairs
to the TV.

58:40.609 --> 58:42.873
What?

58:42.875 --> 58:44.576
Just come here.

58:47.575 --> 58:48.976
<i>Look at this.</i>

58:51.408 --> 58:54.543
What? Why are there
so many people?

58:57.543 --> 58:59.141
Look what they are doing.

58:59.143 --> 59:01.208
They look so happy.

59:01.210 --> 59:02.641
Of course,
they're happy.

59:02.643 --> 59:05.306
<i>We didn't get your shoes
but we got all kinds of stuff.</i>

59:19.909 --> 59:21.776
What has life done to you?

59:24.042 --> 59:25.276
Help me.

59:27.942 --> 59:29.342
Get in.

59:31.275 --> 59:32.977
Jesus.

59:38.643 --> 59:40.577
He's gonna lose all his blood.

59:42.942 --> 59:45.306
Fuck!

59:45.308 --> 59:49.175
<i>The ambulance crews are requiring police
escorts to the area. We'll wait...</i>

59:49.177 --> 59:50.841
How long is it gonna take?

59:50.843 --> 59:52.607
There's victims
all over the place.

59:52.609 --> 59:55.673
- <i>We know.</i>
- My friend is dying.

59:55.675 --> 59:59.406
Do you understand? He's just a
boy and he's dying out here.

59:59.408 --> 01:00:01.441
Please. You have to help us.

01:00:01.443 --> 01:00:04.677
<i>I don't know what to tell you. I'm not
getting anything from the police right now.</i>

01:00:13.842 --> 01:00:15.007
Kids?

01:00:24.976 --> 01:00:26.342
Kids!

01:00:40.976 --> 01:00:43.276
Kids.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.573
I finished my home work.

01:00:46.575 --> 01:00:48.473
But if you want me
to put the Barbies away...

01:00:48.475 --> 01:00:50.876
Baby, where is
everybody else?

01:00:51.275 --> 01:00:53.273
Downstairs?

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.609
Get the door.
Get the door.

01:01:12.209 --> 01:01:14.139
Where should we take him?

01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:16.773
Where the fuck are we?

01:01:16.775 --> 01:01:21.207
Where are the street signs? They took
away all the fucking street signs.

01:01:21.209 --> 01:01:22.844
Can't see anything.

01:01:43.643 --> 01:01:45.008
Careful, Nicole.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:46.577
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:01:53.508 --> 01:01:55.342
Get out of here!

01:01:59.843 --> 01:02:00.911
Stop there!

01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:05.474
Stop!

01:02:05.476 --> 01:02:07.477
Help us!

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:11.477
Sir!

01:02:16.308 --> 01:02:18.943
It's the police station.
Back it up.

01:02:21.076 --> 01:02:24.007
Come on.

01:02:24.009 --> 01:02:27.374
Okay. I know. I know. I'm gonna make
you all something to eat right now.

01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:32.409
You are really hungry.

01:02:33.408 --> 01:02:36.376
I'll make some food.

01:02:38.108 --> 01:02:41.206
Okay. Just one sec.

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:43.974
What's he looking for?

01:02:43.976 --> 01:02:48.007
I don't know, maybe, he's trying to
find something to break these cuffs.

01:02:48.009 --> 01:02:50.574
Okay, I'm coming, babies.

01:02:50.576 --> 01:02:53.644
Just give me one... one second.

01:03:06.243 --> 01:03:09.443
God damn it! God damn it!

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:14.440
You motherfucker!

01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:17.707
Hey, hey! It's dead.
It's dead. Millie. Millie.

01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:21.674
- It's okay. It's okay.
- My boys.

01:03:21.676 --> 01:03:23.574
I thought you were the sane one.

01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:26.473
Hey, come here. Come on.
Come on.

01:03:26.475 --> 01:03:30.139
- Come on. Come here.
- I gotta find my boys.

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:32.241
Now sit. Sit down. Sit down.

01:03:32.243 --> 01:03:35.410
- My babies.
- Sit down. It's okay.

01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:39.708
Here, here, here.

01:03:42.042 --> 01:03:43.541
If that's what you are saying,

01:03:43.543 --> 01:03:45.941
let me tell you,
you're fucking crazy.

01:03:45.943 --> 01:03:47.740
Now keep really still.

01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:49.474
'Cause I've never done
this before.

01:03:49.476 --> 01:03:51.841
- Oh, God. Jesus.
- On three, right?

01:03:51.843 --> 01:03:54.510
Oh! Ha ha! First time!

01:03:55.976 --> 01:03:58.544
- I need a beer.
- Thank you.

01:04:00.443 --> 01:04:02.644
I gotta find my boys.

01:04:03.076 --> 01:04:04.241
All right.

01:04:04.243 --> 01:04:05.673
I gotta find my car keys.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.709
I gotta find my boys.
Where are my keys?

01:04:15.009 --> 01:04:18.173
And as God is my judge, I promise you.
This will be the end for you,

01:04:18.175 --> 01:04:21.507
of the bacon double cheese burger,
the flamed grill chicken burger,

01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:23.708
the big fish, the bacon king,

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.808
the whopper, the bacon king
and the cheese whopper.

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.407
Now it's your circus.

01:04:28.409 --> 01:04:32.874
But if you burn down this Burger King, we
will never ever rebuild another restaurant

01:04:32.876 --> 01:04:36.573
in your neighborhood again. So, you could
say goodbye to our chicken nuggets,

01:04:36.575 --> 01:04:39.708
buffalo ranch, honey mustard
and barbecue dipping sauce.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:43.840
To the hand-spun strawberry
shake, the vanilla soft serve,

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:47.274
the choco chip cookies.
You will have to consider

01:04:47.276 --> 01:04:49.673
being done with a hot
caramel Sunday,

01:04:49.675 --> 01:04:53.309
the strawberry and chocolate
Sunday forever.

01:05:01.108 --> 01:05:03.777
Free food!

01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:18.406
Where's the fucking hospital?

01:05:22.009 --> 01:05:26.107
Hey, excuse me.
How do you get to the hospital?

01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:28.474
Get back on Hoover.
South on Hoover.

01:05:28.476 --> 01:05:30.740
- Where is Hoover?
- Take a left.

01:05:30.742 --> 01:05:34.873
Please, open
your eyes. William!

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.876
William.

01:05:45.376 --> 01:05:47.473
- I can't feel his heart?
- What?

01:05:47.475 --> 01:05:49.073
- I can't...
- What?

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:52.042
I can't feel his heart.

01:06:03.808 --> 01:06:05.709
Drive. Drive somewhere.

01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:44.474

- Did they come back yet?
- No.

01:08:43.009 --> 01:08:44.240
They're nowhere.

01:08:44.242 --> 01:08:46.473
I looked
all over the goddamn city.

01:08:46.475 --> 01:08:49.040

Are you okay, Momma?

01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:18.738
<i>Yeah, I'm going to sell
these and make some money.</i>

01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:21.942
Peaches, can you get your mommy

01:09:25.874 --> 01:09:27.376
Oh, my God.

Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:41.606

01:09:41.608 --> 01:09:45.273
Oh, God. They're really gonna
get it. They gonna get it.

01:09:45.274 --> 01:09:47.773
- Boys. Boys.

01:09:47.774 --> 01:09:51.240
- Get over here right now.
- This is for you, Millie.

01:09:51.242 --> 01:09:52.740
Ruben, get over here.

01:09:52.742 --> 01:09:57.206
You know better,
breaking into somebody's shop.

01:09:57.208 --> 01:10:00.407
What is wrong with you?
Get over here! Ruben!

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:03.106
You are stealing things
from others' store?

01:10:03.108 --> 01:10:06.006
- Really? Of all the things you can steal...
- Hold it there, goddamn it!

01:10:06.008 --> 01:10:08.507
Hold it right there. Turn around,
put your hands behind your head.

01:10:08.509 --> 01:10:10.673
- No, no, we came down here.
- No, these are our boys.

01:10:10.675 --> 01:10:12.873
Because I saw
them doing it.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.939
Now listen to me.
I'm telling you to do something.

01:10:14.941 --> 01:10:18.672
I'm giving you an order.

01:10:18.674 --> 01:10:20.040
What is that?

01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:23.709
What? You are out pillaging
before you rob the bank?

01:10:25.674 --> 01:10:29.074
- Okay. Okay.
- Now I asked you to shut up.

01:10:29.076 --> 01:10:32.474
I asked you nice to shut
the fuck up.

01:10:32.476 --> 01:10:34.906
Okay? And now
you are under arrest.

01:10:34.908 --> 01:10:36.310
Right here.

01:10:37.908 --> 01:10:39.806
What?

01:10:39.808 --> 01:10:41.906
We got an officer
needs assistance call.

01:10:41.908 --> 01:10:44.942
- We're moving.
- No. No!

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:50.040
Not... No. Shit!

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:53.173
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
You understand me?

01:10:53.175 --> 01:10:58.474
You are exactly what I'd been fighting
my whole life, my whole fucking life.

01:10:58.476 --> 01:11:01.240
All right? And let me
tell you something.

01:11:01.242 --> 01:11:03.006
I got a job.

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:05.506
I got a badge.
I got a uniform.

01:11:05.508 --> 01:11:07.907
And I'm gonna put you in jail.

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:10.274
All right? I don't care.

01:11:10.276 --> 01:11:12.207
No, I'm gonna put you in hell.

01:11:12.209 --> 01:11:14.609
And you're not gonna get out.

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:22.807
Wait, wait. Wait a second.

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:25.607
No, no, no.
Get back in the car.

01:11:25.609 --> 01:11:27.539
When are we
going home?

01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:30.073
Well, obviously not right now.

01:11:30.075 --> 01:11:31.807
Now get back in the car.

01:11:31.809 --> 01:11:33.976
And what are you
gonna do about it?

01:11:34.941 --> 01:11:37.207
Okay, look here, Tiger.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:40.043
You wanna talk about
your birthday?

01:11:40.908 --> 01:11:42.173
- No.
- Okay.

01:11:42.175 --> 01:11:45.807
- Okay. What about Christmas?
- This is better than Christmas.

01:11:45.809 --> 01:11:47.576
Hey!

01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.207
Do what you wanna do
right now.

01:11:51.209 --> 01:11:53.040
But when I get out

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:58.040
I'm gonna come over there and I'm gonna
bite your toes off. Get in the car.

01:11:58.042 --> 01:11:59.906
- Get in the car!
- Go. Go.

01:11:59.908 --> 01:12:02.643
Get in the car.
Windows! Windows!

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.840
- I can't believe it.
- Do you smoke?

01:12:05.842 --> 01:12:09.543
I can't be stuck here.
No, no, I don't smoke.

01:12:17.976 --> 01:12:21.608
Let me see I can...

01:12:22.474 --> 01:12:25.406
Hey, hey, stop, stop.

01:13:28.108 --> 01:13:29.875

01:13:41.742 --> 01:13:43.476
I'm sorry.

01:13:44.142 --> 01:13:45.743
I'm sorry.

01:13:51.508 --> 01:13:54.809
Well, was that you?

01:13:58.442 --> 01:14:00.539
I thought it was me.

01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:02.708
I thought I'd just peed myself.

01:14:09.309 --> 01:14:12.010
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:14.642 --> 01:14:16.973
It's only a scratch.

01:14:16.975 --> 01:14:19.207
He's just bleeding a little.

01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:20.772
