00:57.690 --> 00:59.158
Stairs!!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.332
- That's it.
- Huh?

01:07.334 --> 01:08.600
If you love
bike riding so much,

01:08.602 --> 01:10.536
you should learn to
ride one yourself.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.204
You can do that?

01:12.206 --> 01:14.907
Teach me,
teach me, teach me!

01:14.909 --> 01:17.376
( whimpering )

01:17.378 --> 01:19.378
You're not gonna let me
fall, are you, Marco?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.747
Nope. I got you
by the seat.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.015
You won't let go?

01:23.017 --> 01:24.683
I won't let go.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.618
Promise?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.420
Yes, I promise, Star.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.222
Okay. Vroom!

01:30.224 --> 01:31.857
Okay, hold on.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.359
First, this bike
is not a toy.
It's my baby.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.761
My honey.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.429

01:41.435 --> 01:43.435
- ( kissing sounds )
- Okay.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.205
But where are the giant
invisible goats?

01:46.207 --> 01:47.739
Invisible goats?

01:47.741 --> 01:49.241
Come on,
you know.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.943
To pull you!

01:50.945 --> 01:53.779
Everything on Mewni
is pulled by invisible goats.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.748
What? Uh, there are
no giant invisible goats.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.750
On Earth, we use pedals.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.320
Oh, cute!

02:01.322 --> 02:03.722
On Mewni,
only flowers have petals.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.792
Okay, the first step
of biking is to coast.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.160
Okay, you've
got the seat.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.795
I've got the seat.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.798
Huh? Wow!

02:12.800 --> 02:15.834
Hey, I got this.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.437
Yes! Okay, Marco, you can
let go of the seat now.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.640
I think I'm ready
to do it on my own.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.243
- Oh, I already
let go of the seat.
- What?

02:24.245 --> 02:26.311
Yep, you've been riding
all by yourself.

02:26.313 --> 02:30.182
Marco! You said you'd
hold onto the seat.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.518
You lied to me!

02:32.520 --> 02:34.686
Ah, come on. I did it
to give you confidence.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.655
And look at you.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.690
You're awesome, and I
taught you everything you know.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.494
- Except how to stop.
- What?! Use the brakes.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.663
You never taught me...

02:44.665 --> 02:46.832
how!!!

02:46.834 --> 02:49.568
( panting )

02:50.803 --> 02:52.871
Call Star.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.641
( shrieking )

02:55.643 --> 02:56.975
Hi, Marco.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.777
You have to use
the brakes.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.879
Just put your feet
on the pedals

03:00.881 --> 03:02.881
- and push back.
- That doesn't even
make sense.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.883
It's spinning
the other way.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.952
This princess says
no, thank you.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.555
Fine. Do you have
your wand?

03:09.557 --> 03:11.857
Oh, dip.
It's in my backpack.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.494
( keytar playing )

03:15.496 --> 03:17.329
Uh... Oskar?

03:17.331 --> 03:18.697
What are you doing
in my driveway?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.866
I thought this was
my studio.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.869
JK. Everywhere's
my studio.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.705
Whatever. Just drive.
That way.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.241
Seatbelt.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.810
Uh, why is your car
filled with garbage?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.946
Yeah, it's sort of
a live/work space.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.851
Oh, hey, it's Gene.
Oh, double hey, it's my keys.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.054
Go!

03:49.162 --> 03:51.797
Don't walk.
It says don't walk!

03:55.101 --> 03:56.868
Sorry.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.770
( horn honking )

03:58.772 --> 04:01.406
Oskar, Oskar, Oskar, Oskar!

04:05.745 --> 04:08.814
- Cool. Little book dude.
- Glossaryk.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.752
Pop quiz, Mr. Diaz.
Where is Star,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.387
and why do you
have her wand?

04:15.389 --> 04:17.789
I was teaching Star
how to ride a bike.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.791
She doesn't know
how to stop.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.594
- Help.
- Hmm.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.529
Where are the giant
invisible goats?

04:24.531 --> 04:26.565
There are no giant
invisible goats.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.767
Star doesn't have her wand.
You have to help her.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.801
Mmmm.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.704
( chanting )

04:35.742 --> 04:38.143
What?! Are you joking?

04:38.145 --> 04:40.445
Boy, this isn't
a magic problem,

04:40.447 --> 04:42.047
and thusly...

04:42.049 --> 04:44.950
is beyond my control.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.886
Whoa, you put corn
chips on your subs?
That is dope.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.223
I love the crunch!
You must try it.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.761
Whoa!
Cheers.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.095
Cheers.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.897
Uh...

04:58.899 --> 05:01.867
- What is that?
- You play?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.473
( people screaming )

05:10.643 --> 05:12.311
- OSKAR: Okay, now
to the right.
- ( honking )

05:12.313 --> 05:14.813
Back to the left.
You're getting it.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.615
Now put
one finger here.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.650
Can you guys stop
goofing around?!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.252
Star is in trouble!

05:20.254 --> 05:22.321
( synthesized voice )
<i>Trouble, trouble...</i>

05:22.323 --> 05:24.323
Oh, yeah.
MC Oskar on the mic.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.758
Marco make some noise!

05:26.760 --> 05:29.628

06:16.009 --> 06:17.909
Uh, I'm out of rhymes.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.911
Wiggly fan man,
take the mic.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.880
( wind rustling )

06:21.882 --> 06:24.082
Great song.
Number one hit.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.751
Now can we just get
focused on Star

06:25.753 --> 06:27.152
getting her wand back?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.820
I'm with you, man,

06:28.822 --> 06:30.188
but I don't think
we can get to her before the...

06:30.190 --> 06:31.490
Sinkhole?

06:31.492 --> 06:32.958
A sinkhole?!

06:35.495 --> 06:40.165
( screaming )

06:45.938 --> 06:48.340
- Good work, wings.
- ( barking )

06:48.342 --> 06:51.009
If only those dogs
had been wearing helmets.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.444
Wish we had some.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.689
Star, pedal in reverse.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.858
It will work.
Trust me.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.128
I don't trust you
anymore, Marco Diaz.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.364
Besides, I'm moving forward.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.965
Pedaling backwards
doesn't make any sense.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.202
I know just how she feels,
'cause I can't stop either.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.672
The brakes are out.
Steering wheel, too.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.178
Everybody lean!

07:28.781 --> 07:30.048
Cuddle puddle.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.152
Star, quick,
the wand.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.521
- Use your magic.
- What?

07:38.791 --> 07:42.661
Oskar!

07:42.663 --> 07:45.397
Star, wait. Your wand.
( gasps )

07:49.235 --> 07:51.036
Total eclipse!

07:57.577 --> 07:59.978
- Marco!!
- Star!

07:59.980 --> 08:01.913
- ( shrieks )
- ( horn honking )

08:05.084 --> 08:07.252
I should've never
let go of her seat.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.920
Okay, no more
kidding around.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.422
This calls for magic.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.691
( chanting )

08:12.693 --> 08:15.026
( stomach rumbling )

08:15.028 --> 08:18.630
Uh... which is what I'd do

08:18.632 --> 08:22.367
if I hadn't eaten that...
ooh... that meatball sub.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.468
( groaning )

08:23.470 --> 08:26.204
Word.
( groans )

08:26.206 --> 08:28.306
Okay, it's up to
you, Marco.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.942
Give her wand to her
and save her life.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.444
How? The car's wrecked.

08:32.446 --> 08:34.312
Ride the invisible
goats, of course.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.015
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna be sick.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.117
( vomiting )

08:39.119 --> 08:41.152
( angry stammering )

08:41.154 --> 08:44.823
For the last time, there are
no giant invisible goats.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.058
Sure there are.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.728
You just need to believe.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.830
If you want to save Star,
trust in goats.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.365
( vomiting )

08:53.367 --> 08:57.469
Fine. If it saves Star,
I'll believe.

09:01.374 --> 09:06.077
ALL: Believe,
believe, believe.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.346
Believe!

09:08.348 --> 09:10.048
Believe!

09:12.318 --> 09:14.753
( goat bleating )

09:14.755 --> 09:16.922
I'm on an invisible goat!

09:16.924 --> 09:19.090
( laughing )

09:19.092 --> 09:23.028
Okay, goat, tally whoa!!

09:23.030 --> 09:24.563
Whoa!

09:26.165 --> 09:30.101
Star, take the wand.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.103
Marco, you're my hero.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.105
Who I'm still upset with
for lying to me

09:34.107 --> 09:35.740
about holding my seat.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.109
Come on, give me one more
chance. Hurry!

09:38.111 --> 09:40.845
( Marco yelling )

09:43.115 --> 09:45.250
Help! Help, help!

09:48.087 --> 09:52.591
( Star screaming,
goat bleating )

09:52.593 --> 09:55.126
You're gonna have to stop
the bike by yourself.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.696
Pedal in reverse!

09:57.698 --> 10:00.565
I told you, that is not
how we do things on Mewni.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.968
You're not on Mewni
anymore, Star.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.103
And if I can believe in
an invisible goat,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.772
then you can stop
that bike.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.108
I got you.
Trust me.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.378
Thanks, Marco.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.181
But you believing in me
is all I need.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.458
- Star!
- ( goat bleats )

10:26.460 --> 10:28.760
I was so worried
about you.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.729
Marco, you were right.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.397
I can ride a bike.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.766
And I am
awesome at it.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.668
How about
Mysterious Sonograms?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.837
That's a good
band name.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.939
But does it match
our sound?

10:40.941 --> 10:43.274
Hey, Oskar, I'm really
sorry about your car.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.311
But if you want, I can
give you a ride home
on my bike.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.447
Cool. Hey, Glossaryk,
Gene, hop on.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.449
Safety first.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.284
Marco, you coming?

10:53.286 --> 10:56.488
No thanks, Star.
I'll take the goat.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.190
Believe.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.331
( laughter )
Oh, Marco, the goat
left long ago.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.367
( groaning )

11:09.369 --> 11:11.670
( horns honking )

11:14.173 --> 11:16.341
Okay, Diaz, you got this.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.810
Aim it at
the little...

11:18.812 --> 11:20.211
( angry muttering )

11:20.213 --> 11:22.514
All right, going again.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.851
Hey, this is
hard enough already.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.154
Star, can you please
get control of these puppies?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.622
I'm trying to focus.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.458
Yeah, no problem.
Totally. Come on.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.362
I believe in
you, Marco.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.197
Star, I'm concentrating.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.498
Right, right,
right, right, right.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.367
Okay, I'll be quiet.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.336
Even if no one
else does...
I believe.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.205
Got it. I'm
trying to focus.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.973
( mirror chiming )

11:48.975 --> 11:51.342
Just answer it, please.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.845
Ugh. Hey, Mom.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.381
<i>Star, your Aunt Felicity</i>
<i>still hasn't received</i>

11:56.383 --> 11:58.550
<i>her thank-you card for</i>
<i>the lovely necklace...</i>

11:58.552 --> 12:00.251
Just give me the juice!

12:00.253 --> 12:01.920
I can't right now, Mom.
Things are happening.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.188
<i>You said that</i>
<i>the last time...</i>

12:03.190 --> 12:05.323
Marco, did you
free the nectar

12:05.325 --> 12:07.225
from the juice cocoon?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.060
Get the puppies
out of the way.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.596
Oh, stop it, puppies.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.399
Here. Go fetch!

12:14.401 --> 12:18.036
Oh no!

12:18.038 --> 12:19.237
Did you just
throw your wand?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.572
I threw my wand.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.574
The poo-poo bin!
No, no, no!

12:22.576 --> 12:24.042
Oh, thank Mewni.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.211
Saved by the bush.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.612
What?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.948
( straining )
Got it.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.353
Oh, you're
just a doggie.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.422
For a second, I thought
you were a gargoyle.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.391
- Thank you for
bringing me my wand.
- ( growls )

12:40.393 --> 12:42.427
Ooh!

12:44.063 --> 12:45.797
- I can just...
- ( growling )

12:45.799 --> 12:48.466
- Let me just get...
- ( growling )

12:48.468 --> 12:51.469
All right,
this is annoying.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.239
Is your person
here somewhere?

12:54.241 --> 12:56.808
There's no one else
in the park, Star.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.210
Everyone always leaves
when we get here...

12:59.212 --> 13:01.312
for some reason.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.482
The laser puppies
are hungry.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.352
- Just grab your wand.
Let's go.
- Hmm.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.222
Star, what are
you doing?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.291
That's a dog,
not a coat.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.993
- Fur coat.
- No.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.395
Look, you're basically
a pet owner now.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.297
You're gonna have
to feed him.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.533
He'll put the wand down
if he wants to eat.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.343
- Okay.
- Is that normal?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.646
( toilet flushing )

13:34.648 --> 13:36.581
( water running )

13:41.320 --> 13:44.355
Sorry. This is
your problem.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.691
I'm gonna go to bed.
Come on, puppies.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.660
( barking )

13:51.764 --> 13:53.765
Hi.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.633
So it's
bedtime now,

13:55.635 --> 13:58.536
and I sleep best
with my wand

13:58.538 --> 14:00.505
right under my pillow.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.974
Even though my mom
says not to,

14:02.976 --> 14:06.211
because of...
radiation.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.780
( growling )

14:08.782 --> 14:10.849
( snoring )

14:15.487 --> 14:17.455
Star, you down here?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.157
- What?
- ( screams )

14:19.159 --> 14:21.793
Star, come on.
We gotta get going.

14:21.795 --> 14:22.827
We're gonna be
late for school.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.996
Okay, okay.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.731
- Just give me a sec.
- ( growling )

14:26.733 --> 14:30.635
Magic doggie,
get me ready for school.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.807
All right.
Guess it's a hat day.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.542
( bell rings )

14:37.544 --> 14:39.544
They make this for kids.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.179
Just open!

14:41.181 --> 14:43.214
- Miss Butterfly.
- What?!

14:43.216 --> 14:44.649
Where are you going
with that dog?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.751
He's got my wand.

14:46.753 --> 14:50.388
A dog in a classroom
is a roadblock to learning.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.358
Do not come back until
you get rid of that dog!

14:53.360 --> 14:55.026
( groaning )

14:55.028 --> 14:56.628
- Cool hat,
Star Butterfly.
- Shut up.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.565
<i>Star, you have to send</i>
<i>your aunt a thank-you card.</i>

15:00.567 --> 15:02.333
<i>It's a really nice</i>
<i>necklace.</i>

15:02.335 --> 15:04.569
I can't talk right now, Mom.
I just got kicked out of school.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.605
-   <i>What...</i>
<i>- Uh, no dogs in the store.</i>

15:07.607 --> 15:09.908
Sure. Ignore me.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.677
I'm not, like,
a person with feelings.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.579
Or anything.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.881
That'll be a buck-fifty.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.083
Oh, I can't make
any money right now,

15:19.085 --> 15:21.452
'cause my dog
has my wand.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.221
- ( growling )
- See?

15:23.223 --> 15:25.523
Right.
On your tab then?

15:25.525 --> 15:27.625
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.459
It's Marco Diaz.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.228
Cool. Thanks, Joe.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.562
Name's not Joe.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.797
And my name's
not Marco.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.066
( gasps )
Lost dog!

15:35.068 --> 15:37.235
( doorbell chimes )

15:37.237 --> 15:39.037
Come back.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.576
Please stop that.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.112
Sorry.
( giggles )

15:48.114 --> 15:51.482
"Lost smallish
medium-to-large dog."

15:51.484 --> 15:54.485
You're a smallish
medium-to-large dog.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.653
"Dog-ish face."

15:55.655 --> 15:57.655
Yep, dog-ish face.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.290
"May or may not bark."

15:59.292 --> 16:01.092
( growls )

16:01.094 --> 16:02.894
You may or may not bark!

16:02.896 --> 16:05.563
I'm pretty sure this flyer
is talking about you, mister.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.566
"Call 555-0199."

16:08.568 --> 16:10.168
Okay, 555-0199.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.502
( phone dialing )

16:11.504 --> 16:13.604
( line ringing )

16:13.606 --> 16:15.573
Hello. Thank you
for calling--

16:15.575 --> 16:18.343
Hi. I got your flyer
and I think I found your dog.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.579
I do not have
any pets.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.115
Is someone calling
about my dog?

16:24.117 --> 16:26.584
- Uh, yeah.
- It's for me.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.520
Hello.
This is Lydia.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.322
Hi. I found your dog.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.291
I am outside
the Stop And Slurp.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.093
Be right there.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.928
Okay. Bye.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.497
Hi. Here for
this little gargoyle?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.698
I found him.
Here you go.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.502
Come to Mommy,
my little, um...

16:44.504 --> 16:48.139
Willow... bee.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.275
Right. Okay. Can you get
Willoughby to drop my wand?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.478
I... I can do that.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.614
Willoughby,
put it down.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.117
Where are you going?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.157
( toilet flushing )

17:06.159 --> 17:07.625
( water running )

17:07.627 --> 17:09.627
It's cool you taught
your dog to use the bathroom.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.362
Yeah.
( nervous giggle )

17:13.532 --> 17:15.233
That's not your dog,
is it?

17:15.235 --> 17:17.535
( nervous giggle )

17:19.004 --> 17:23.174
But I have...
so much love to give.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.476
MARCO: Stand up.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.412
- Bark.
- ( barks )

17:27.414 --> 17:29.714
Now play pirate.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.049
Now laser the hole.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.117
( shrieks )

17:35.754 --> 17:38.723
- Okay, everything
is half red.
- ( door opens )

17:38.725 --> 17:40.058
Star, where
have you been?

17:40.060 --> 17:41.759
- I don't wanna
talk about it.
- Okay.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.761
Today was the worst
day ever, Marco.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.663
I got sent home from school,
I couldn't make any money,

17:45.665 --> 17:47.398
- so I had to put
everything on your tab.
- What?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.734
I was harassed
by a weird lady,

17:49.736 --> 17:53.104
and worst of all,
Willoughby still won't
give me back my wand.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.739
( frustrated groan )

17:54.741 --> 17:56.441
His name's Willoughby?

17:56.443 --> 17:58.443
That's what the weird
lady called him.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.678
I thought I found
his owner, but she
was just a fake.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.781
Yeah, this flyer's
obviously fake,

18:03.783 --> 18:05.349
but let's go back
to the dog park

18:05.351 --> 18:07.251
and see if his real owner
put up a flyer.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.353
( sighs )
Okay.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.356
- You know your eye
is glowing, right?
- I know.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.761
Nope.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.263
Beep, beep, beep.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.731
Where's your owner?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.434
My problem is,
I'm stuck in
a doubt loop.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.603
You so are.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.272
( beeping rapidly )

18:28.274 --> 18:29.640
( buzzing )

18:29.642 --> 18:31.709
Mm-mm.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.646
Come on, Willoughby.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.915
- Why is this so hard?
- I know. Right?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.251
Oh, right.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.786
Your thing is hard, too.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.821
( groaning )

18:43.823 --> 18:45.623
Willoughby senses something.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.991
( Star gasps )

18:46.993 --> 18:52.663
Marco, look.
Beautiful businessman.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.400
Go, Willoughby.
Go to your businessman.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.817
That's it!
What the...

19:21.360 --> 19:22.860
Sorry.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.329
What just happened?

19:25.331 --> 19:27.765
Who are you?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.367
It doesn't matter.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.302
Why did you
take my wand?

19:31.304 --> 19:33.804
( sighs )
Because in my dimension,

19:33.806 --> 19:35.840
dogs are the ones
with all the problems.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.775
There's no escape.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.278
Only sadness.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.047
It's easier if you
poke it from the bottom.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.916
You did it.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.685
White grape.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.188
All I really want
is to be...

19:50.190 --> 19:51.889
like them.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.692
I thought if I
zapped myself with your wand,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.794
I could quiet
my troubled mind.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.362
( slurping )

20:00.065 --> 20:02.700
But you can't just
run away from
all your problems.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.803
( choking ) You run away from
your problems all the time.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.072
No. I just take breaks.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.708
That's what I want.
I want a break.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.743
You don't need
magic for that.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.712
You need
a chew toy.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.913
( squeaking )

20:15.915 --> 20:18.082
And you need
to play fetch.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.917
No, Star!
No fetch.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.752
Oh, yeah.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.254
And you need
a Marco, too.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.725
Hey, Lydia,
I found your dog.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.760
Again.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.262
I've been here
all along.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.931
Come here,
my sweet little boy.

20:33.933 --> 20:34.999
Actually, he's a girl.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.734
It doesn't matter.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.537
My little cake pop.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.772
It's time to come home.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.274
Go on.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.943
I guess it couldn't hurt.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.579
Wait.
There's one more thing.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.719
Your necklace?

20:54.721 --> 20:55.753
I couldn't.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.355
Eh, it's a win-win.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.257
This way, I don't have
to send my Aunt Felicity

20:59.259 --> 21:00.758
a thank-you card.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.959
( baby talk )
Now go get your Lydia.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.362
Uh, why are you
talking to me like that?

21:04.364 --> 21:08.132
'Cause that's how
we talk to wittle doggies.

21:13.572 --> 21:18.376
This is what happiness
feels like.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.846
( panting )

21:24.316 --> 21:27.952
Thank you for
finding my dog.
Bye.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.990
See, Marco?
I do face my problems.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.425
( compact ringing )

21:34.427 --> 21:36.327
Is that your mom
calling again?

21:36.329 --> 21:38.229
