00:22.680 --> 00:25.599
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.399
On tonight's show, we've got big
trucks, tiny tanks and a flying car.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.879
That's right, you heard me,
a flying car.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.879
But first, let's talk about McLaren,
OK?

00:34.880 --> 00:38.359
They used to be really good at
making F1 cars go really fast.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.719
Nowadays, not so much.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.279
Sorry, Fernando.
But as Chris will explain,

00:43.280 --> 00:46.559
all that victory champagne
they haven't been drinking

00:46.560 --> 00:50.360
has left them very clear-headed
for thinking up supercars.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.279
This is the McLaren 720S.

01:03.280 --> 01:08.839
It costs over £200,000,
which is proper supercar money.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.360
And you have to admit, it
looks like a proper supercar, too.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.560
Sculptured...

01:19.240 --> 01:20.919
theatrical,

01:20.920 --> 01:23.480
everything a supercar should be.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.399
But the first thing that hits you
about the 720 is how unsupercar-y

01:41.400 --> 01:42.560
it feels out on the road.

01:44.560 --> 01:45.839
It's polite.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.960
It's easy to drive.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.359
That might sound weird
because it costs 200 grand,

01:51.360 --> 01:53.159
so it really ought to, right?

01:53.160 --> 01:57.120
But most supercars aren't polite
and they aren't easy to drive.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.799
For starters,
there's the visibility.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.039
I mean, in most supercars,
you feel like you've been kidnapped

02:04.040 --> 02:05.959
in a particularly cramped postbox.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.119
But not the 720.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.840
In here, it's light and airy,
glassy.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.160
And as for the ride, well,
that's not very supercar-y either.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.479
Now, traditionally,
to make a supercar go round

02:25.480 --> 02:26.959
a track without ending up

02:26.960 --> 02:31.240
on its roof on fire, it had to have
super stiff suspension.

02:33.560 --> 02:37.359
But that meant that driving it on
a lumpy road like this was about

02:37.360 --> 02:39.919
as comfortable as, I don't know,

02:39.920 --> 02:42.680
mistaking your contact lens solution
for chilli oil.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.640
But the 720S is anything
but traditional.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.719
Its cross-linked
hydraulic suspension

02:56.720 --> 02:59.879
is the result
of a five-year PhD project

02:59.880 --> 03:01.640
at the University of Cambridge.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.840
Seriously, doctors of suspension.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.599
And those doctors clearly know their
stuff because driving this thing

03:14.600 --> 03:17.359
in its slackest mode,
the ride is so good.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.720
It's so comfortable, so supple.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.880
It's like witchcraft!

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Good Lord!

03:30.240 --> 03:31.480
Fast!

03:36.920 --> 03:40.999
There's more cutting-edge design
in the pared back bodywork.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.999
Those gaping headlights might look
a bit Skeletor,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.440
but they also act as air intakes.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.599
Likewise, the doors,
which are double-skinned,

03:50.600 --> 03:53.800
creating hidden channels that
draw cold air into the engine.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.039
The result is a car that is twice
as aerodynamically efficient

04:03.040 --> 04:05.440
as the old 650S it replaces.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.400
It's all very clever.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.439
But cleverness doesn't make
a supercar.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.920
What makes a supercar is going
really, really fast.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.720
This is Portimao.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.400
One of Europe's finest racetracks.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.800
And one with a special place
in my heart...

04:32.200 --> 04:34.719
because back when I was still living
on the internet,

04:34.720 --> 04:39.320
I came here with the three fastest
road cars ever made.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.000
The Porsche 918 Spider.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.560
The LaFerrari.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.440
And the McLaren P1.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.400
This, then, is the perfect place
to test extreme speed.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.759
Right, then, it's got 720 horsepower

05:04.760 --> 05:07.199
from a twin turbo V8, back there,

05:07.200 --> 05:10.159
and it weighs about 1,400kg,

05:10.160 --> 05:12.879
which is the same as a Golf.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.320
Should be quite rapid, then.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.560
That is mighty fast!

05:24.280 --> 05:26.080
Quicker than I'd expected.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.800
McLaren claims 0-60 in 2.9 seconds.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.760
Four seconds later,
it's doing 120mph.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.440
Top speed - 212!

05:44.760 --> 05:50.200
And the handling, well, it's flat,
it's grippy, it's accurate.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.999
It really is very, very sharp.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.400
Racing-car like.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.600
It's animal. It's a proper animal.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.919
Now, when you need a break from
going really fast facing forward,

06:11.920 --> 06:16.200
the 720S has something called
variable drift control.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.719
This lets you select
your preferred drift angle,

06:20.720 --> 06:23.280
and the car will take care
of the rest.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.520
The other, less sophisticated,
method is to turn all of that...

06:29.480 --> 06:30.760
off.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.879
Woohoo!

06:34.880 --> 06:36.760
How good is that?!

06:47.240 --> 06:49.999
I have to say, I've driven
some pretty serious machinery

06:50.000 --> 06:53.999
around this track, and this thing
feels about as quick as any of them.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.200
Which is why I've invited along
a special guest.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.799
You see, a few years ago when I got
those three cars together,

07:10.800 --> 07:16.120
it was that one that went fastest
of all. The McLaren P1.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.399
£800,000.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.239
900 horsepower.

07:23.240 --> 07:28.799
And quicker around this track than
the LaFerrari and the 918 Spider.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.759
So, the question is, just how close
can the 720S get

07:33.760 --> 07:35.999
to its big brother,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.040
the reigning champion?

07:38.200 --> 07:39.639
Well, to find out,

07:39.640 --> 07:42.479
obviously I need to lap
the P1 again.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.199
I'm selfless like that.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.319
So, same conditions for both cars,

07:47.320 --> 07:49.720
one flying lap, here goes.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.279
I'm all ends up.
That's all the braking I've got.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.919
Can I get it through?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.440
Good Lord!

08:05.680 --> 08:10.080
So much flatter and stiffer
after the 720.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.440
It's got power.
It's completely addictive.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.439
You can't believe that the new car
can get anywhere near to it.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.160
Whoa-ho-ho!

08:26.960 --> 08:31.519
It's slammed onto the deck,
200 horsepower more than the 720S,

08:31.520 --> 08:32.880
it's got everything more.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.240
Just so violent.

08:41.360 --> 08:46.040
Pin your ears back and feel
that 900 horsepower!

08:47.720 --> 08:49.680
Oh!

08:51.920 --> 08:53.999
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.680
It doesn't get much better
than that for me.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.639
OK, the time for the P1

09:03.640 --> 09:07.959
was 1:54.07.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.799
1:54.07.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.399
OK, so,

09:12.400 --> 09:14.679
I think that is a good time,

09:14.680 --> 09:16.279
and I struggle to see

09:16.280 --> 09:19.080
how the 720 can get
anywhere near it.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.239
So, 1:54.07.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.280
I mean, that's mighty fast
around here.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.200
Yes, hyper-car fast.

09:33.280 --> 09:37.759
Make no mistake, to even get
within sight of the P1,

09:37.760 --> 09:40.360
the 720S has its work cut out.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.759
I mean, it does feel faintly
ridiculous to even think

09:47.760 --> 09:50.919
that this relatively normal
series production car

09:50.920 --> 09:52.440
can get anywhere near it.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.240
All right, let's start to push.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.199
Brake hard into turn one.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.520
Don't overcook it.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.800
Get on the gas early,
use all the kerb.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.799
Get out of the corner.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.240
Full power.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.319
The P1 bludgeons it down
the straights.

10:20.320 --> 10:25.200
But this is closer than I expected.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.000
God, that's lairy.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.840
This is crucial now.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.520
I'm flat now. I'm flat now.
It feels wrong to be flat there.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.359
Over the line.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.080
You can do it. You can do it.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.879
There we go.
Right, let's have a look.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.920
What's it done?

10:50.240 --> 10:54.999
So, the P1 did 1:54.07.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.919
I know it monsters this
in a straight line,

10:56.920 --> 10:58.720
but this feels so good.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.159
So, can I have the lap time, please?

11:03.160 --> 11:08.999
The 720 did it in a 1:55.20.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.639
1:55.20, so half a second off.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.159
So, it was half a second slower.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.879
That's remarkable!

11:18.880 --> 11:20.399
Do half a second on your stopwatch.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.079
Get your watch and go bang, bang,

11:22.080 --> 11:24.479
and look at how long half a second
is.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.759
Remember, the P1 is £600,000
more expensive than this car.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.799
Imagine going to the bank manager
and saying, "Can I borrow 600 grand",

11:32.800 --> 11:36.359
"please, so I can go
half a second quicker?"

11:36.360 --> 11:37.800
I think I'd just save the cash.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.799
The 720S is the next stage
of supercar evolution,

11:52.800 --> 11:55.719
a step forward so great
that it's difficult to make sense of

11:55.720 --> 11:57.920
in conventional terms.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.199
Now, in the world of computers,

12:01.200 --> 12:05.359
there's something called Moore's law
which observes that every two years,

12:05.360 --> 12:08.199
the power of a microchip doubles.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.159
Moore's law is why
your new smartphone

12:10.160 --> 12:13.599
is so much better
than your last one.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.000
And the 720S, well,
it's Moore's law for fast.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.879
Now, I know £200,000
is an awful lot of money.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.479
But look at it another way -

12:27.480 --> 12:32.880
in just four years, the cost of
going McLaren P1 fast has quartered.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.120
That makes this 720S
a complete bargain.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.000
A brilliant British bargain.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.800
- Well done.
- What a car.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.199
Incredible stuff. Incredible stuff.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.679
Decent driving as well.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.039
I'm sorry? Earlier,
you said it was great driving.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.439
Well, I don't want to give you
too much of a big head.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.199
Listen, this film raises a couple of
big issues,

13:19.200 --> 13:21.679
so we should start with
the biggest. This.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.079
What's going on here?
You've got race gloves.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.559
- Mm-hm.
- Race helmet.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.959
- Mm-hm. - T-shirt.
- It was hot.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.199
- It was hot? - It was hot.
- I'm thinking safety.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.959
If you have a big fiery crash,

13:32.960 --> 13:35.039
your hands will be fine,
but your arms will melt.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.079
We'll have to attach your hands
to your helmet.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.479
Can we just get back to the point of
the film, please, Rory?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.159
Yeah, which was that
the more powerful,

13:41.160 --> 13:44.879
more expensive car was faster
than the cheaper, less powerful car.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.159
- Ground-breaking.
- Come on.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.079
It was only a tiny bit slower.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.439
It really is stupidly quick.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.039
OK, I've worked it out -
at this rate of progress, OK,

13:54.040 --> 13:57.919
in two years' time,
a car this fast will be 100 grand.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.959
OK? Four years after that, 25 grand.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.199
- Mm-hm.
- In a decade,

14:02.200 --> 14:06.319
you'll be able to go McLaren P1 fast
for about five grand.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.159
It's basic maths, Rory.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.879
- I like that maths.
- Now,

14:09.880 --> 14:12.999
this is normally the bit where
we'd hand over the 720S to the Stig

14:13.000 --> 14:15.519
to find out how fast it goes
around our test track.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.479
But it's just too cold out there
today to get any temperature

14:18.480 --> 14:19.999
into those tyres, and we want

14:20.000 --> 14:22.159
to give McLaren a fair crack
of the whip,

14:22.160 --> 14:24.479
so we're going to invite it back
later in the year,

14:24.480 --> 14:27.639
and we'll also get
the Ferrari FXX-K from last year

14:27.640 --> 14:29.879
and maybe the Bugatti Chiron, too.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.519
Watch this space.

14:31.520 --> 14:35.359
Now, for some cars that don't care
about the weather, off-roaders,

14:35.360 --> 14:36.679
and I don't mean this...

14:36.680 --> 14:38.319
I don't even know what this is.

14:38.320 --> 14:42.199
No, I'm talking nimble stuff to get
you deep into the wilderness,

14:42.200 --> 14:45.999
way off the beaten path deep,
bugs in your teeth,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.519
never recover the bodies deep,
like, deep, OK?

14:49.520 --> 14:52.119
There's a whole world of off-road
toys out there,

14:52.120 --> 14:54.159
so I've rounded up some of the best

14:54.160 --> 14:57.800
and headed to the woods in America
for a little camping trip.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.400
Welcome to backcountry.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.679
If you're going to do a job,
do it right,

15:21.680 --> 15:23.600
and this is how you do camping.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.359
The Ford F-650 super truck.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.639
Six tonnes and 28ft
of go-anywhere vehicle,

15:31.640 --> 15:35.960
plus 28ft of trailer full
of go-anywhere vehicles.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.120
I've got everything I need for
a little weekend in the woods.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.159
There's just one small...

15:45.160 --> 15:46.800
bald thing left to pack.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.520
Look at that, that's cool.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.240
I've got a whistle on my clip.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.680
And there he is.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.999
You're kidding me.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.359
I shouldn't have expected anything
less, should I, really?

16:04.360 --> 16:06.239
There you are.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.599
What is that?!

16:07.600 --> 16:11.559
This is the Ford F-650
super truck.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.079
I'm speechless. It's massive.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.959
What's in the trailer?

16:15.960 --> 16:17.839
Well, that's a surprise.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.319
A couple of goodies for us.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.360
Come on, hop in.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.120
Oh, look at the step!

16:25.000 --> 16:26.959
What's this? What is all that?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.239
That's my camping equipment.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.639
This is... Look how high it is
off the ground!

16:31.640 --> 16:32.680
It's great, isn't it?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.399
- What a vehicle.
- Is it nice, or what?

16:38.400 --> 16:41.519
- What's it got for a motor? Come on.
- Oh, a big one.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.159
It's got a caterpillar C-7.

16:43.160 --> 16:47.559
330 horse, 850 lb-ft of torque.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.679
How much money for this?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.599
About £175,000.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.039
- What?! - Yeah.
- 175 grand?!

16:54.040 --> 16:56.559
Yeah. Guess how much fuel it holds.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.159
- I've no idea.
- 800 litres.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.479
So, it's over a grand
to fill up in the UK.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.199
Wow.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.358
But we weren't in the UK.

17:05.359 --> 17:06.880
We were in the US...

17:08.760 --> 17:11.479
heading towards the vast
mountainous wilderness

17:11.480 --> 17:13.839
of the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.638
By the way, what are you wearing?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.519
My outdoor clothing.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.439
We're in Northern California.

17:22.440 --> 17:27.638
It gets cold at night. Snakes,
poison oak, they've got bear,

17:27.640 --> 17:29.479
black bear, brown bear.

17:29.480 --> 17:33.519
OK. Are there any known cases
of human beings defending themselves

17:33.520 --> 17:38.599
against grizzly bear attacks using
one of Swiss army's smaller knives?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.119
That will serve you best
if you use it to slit

17:41.120 --> 17:43.440
your own throat before the bear gets
to you.

17:47.320 --> 17:51.599
This felt like a good opportunity to
tell Chris that, to help us test our

17:51.600 --> 17:55.680
off-road toys, I had planned
an exciting little project.

17:56.720 --> 18:00.599
Now, in these woods
is something very special,

18:00.600 --> 18:03.359
and we are going to go and find it.

18:03.360 --> 18:07.559
You and I are going to go
and find Bigfoot.

18:07.560 --> 18:11.679
- Yeah!
- No, what?!

18:11.680 --> 18:14.239
You and I are going to go find
Bigfoot.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.719
We're going to go and find something
that doesn't exist?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.999
No, no, no, no, he exists.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.199
What do you mean, he exists?

18:21.200 --> 18:25.199
He exists. This is where
that Patterson film was shot,

18:25.200 --> 18:27.159
that original footage that you see,
you know,

18:27.160 --> 18:29.919
when he's looking back over his
shoulder. That was around here.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.399
Oh, the grainy footage of the bloke
dressed as a gorilla?

18:32.400 --> 18:35.959
No, no, OK, first...
OK, he's not a gorilla.

18:35.960 --> 18:40.359
He's an ape-like, humanlike beast
that lives in these woods.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.879
You've brought me here
under false pretences.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.119
- We're going camping.
- Yes.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.479
And we're going to test
these off-road toys,

18:46.480 --> 18:49.559
and we're going to test these
off-road toys in the process

18:49.560 --> 18:52.120
of looking - and finding - Bigfoot.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.359
You've lost it, mate.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.679
I haven't lost it at all.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.840
Go ahead, ask somebody.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.919
So, as we arrived in the sprawling
metropolis of... Hayfork,

19:02.920 --> 19:04.720
that's exactly what I did.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.359
I've been brought here to look
for something called Bigfoot.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.799
I can't hear you. What?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.919
Do you believe in Bigfoot?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.919
- Yeah.
- You believe in Bigfoot?

19:15.920 --> 19:17.320
- Yeah.
- Find another one.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.479
OK, she looks less mad.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.559
Excuse me, madam. Bigfoot,
have you ever seen a Bigfoot?

19:26.560 --> 19:28.919
No, I've never seen him,
but I know he's out there.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.959
You know he's out...
You KNOW he's out there?

19:30.960 --> 19:33.199
- Oh, yes, he's out there.
- Thank you, and have a nice day.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.240
Thank you!

19:37.480 --> 19:40.879
He's brought me here
to find Bigfoot.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.599
That's a possibility.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.599
- I'm sorry?
- The last time I've seen a footprint was back in '96,

19:46.600 --> 19:49.799
but, you know, it doesn't mean
he's not still here.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.439
So, you believe that
there's something out there.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.360
Has to be. Where else would
the footprint come from?

19:59.960 --> 20:01.640
How can you say he's not out there?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.959
I can't say for sure
what's out there,

20:05.960 --> 20:08.719
and I can't say for sure what's not
out there.

20:08.720 --> 20:12.599
- But that doesn't... - OK, period, full-stop.
- But that doesn't support

20:12.600 --> 20:15.680
your belief that there's
an 8ft gorilla out there.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.720
He's not a... He's not a gorilla.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.159
OK? Can we please stop referring
to him as a gorilla?

20:25.160 --> 20:26.480
This is madness.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.719
Look at that view.

20:35.720 --> 20:40.439
Come on! Now, you look over there
in those woods.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.479
They just go on and on and on.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.679
Look how dense it is.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.959
There could be something hiding,
you'd never know it was there.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.440
There's parts of this forest
where man has not been.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.079
- I mean, there's no...
- I know what you're going to say.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.119
- What?
- But just because it's a large area doesn't mean that that could

21:03.120 --> 21:07.199
support an entire population
of 8ft gorillas.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.000
They're not gorillas!

21:12.120 --> 21:17.039
Many slightly frosty miles later,
we arrived at our destination.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.279
Unsure of what lay ahead of us
and what, if anything,

21:20.280 --> 21:24.599
might be hiding in the woods we
decided to set up camp,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.160
which in my case
was the work of a moment.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.880
Look at that.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.839
What is that?

21:34.840 --> 21:36.759
That is my self-erecting tent.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.680
That is genius British engineering
there.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.359
- You know there's mountain lions out here?
- Yeah?

21:43.360 --> 21:47.679
So, in that, you're basically
a human burrito, OK?

21:47.680 --> 21:49.639
You think about that. Here,

21:49.640 --> 21:51.759
I got you some clothes
and some books on Bigfoot,

21:51.760 --> 21:53.759
so you can brush up
on your knowledge, huh?

21:53.760 --> 21:56.439
- We're going to find him.
- Books on Bigfoot? - Yeah.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.840
Oh, for crying out loud.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.240
What absolute rubbish.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.919
Now, this is absolute rubbish!

22:09.920 --> 22:11.999
Here we go.
Matt will find this irritating.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.520
It has actually got a strand
that links it to the gorilla.

22:16.120 --> 22:20.799
Also the lemur, an animal
only found on Madagascar,

22:20.800 --> 22:24.080
which has never been in contact
with this continent.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.640
Oh, it's just rubbish.
Absolute rubbish.

22:30.360 --> 22:35.239
But sadly, not quite as rubbish as
the clothes Matt had found for me.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.679
What have you done
with these trousers?

22:37.680 --> 22:41.199
- How do they fit? Good?
- No, they fit terribly.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.240
- Oh. Did you grow?
- What's that?

22:44.600 --> 22:46.159
That?

22:46.160 --> 22:48.599
- That's your Bigfoot Patrol patch.
- Why don't you have one?

22:48.600 --> 22:49.999
Well, because I'm the sheriff,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.760
you're the deputy.
You wear the patch.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.160
- Oh, my God.
- Where are you going? Where are you going?

22:58.400 --> 23:01.559
Sensing a slight lack of motivation
in Chris,

23:01.560 --> 23:05.480
it was time to inject some
enthusiasm and open up the toy box.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.440
Huh?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.240
Total arsehole!

23:35.520 --> 23:37.359
What is that?

23:37.360 --> 23:38.519
It's called the SHERP.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.919
It comes from Russia.

23:39.920 --> 23:44.839
It was designed for workers in their
gear to access inaccessible terrain.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.959
Huh? Which is perfect for us because
now it will take us and our gear out

23:48.960 --> 23:50.119
to where Bigfoot is.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.439
It's like a Tonka toy
with 747 wheels on it.

23:52.440 --> 23:55.279
- It's awesome. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's great.
- How do I get in?

23:55.280 --> 23:56.320
Right here.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.200
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.879
- Watch your head.
- Oh, yes.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.799
- Huh?
- Look at this.

24:03.800 --> 24:04.840
How great is that?

24:05.840 --> 24:08.399
Costs about £90,000,
and I know that sounds like a lot

24:08.400 --> 24:11.199
for an off-road toy,
but you do get a lot of...

24:11.200 --> 24:12.879
what, tyre for your money.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.159
Is the steering wheel extra?

24:14.160 --> 24:16.359
Yeah, no steering wheel.
It's like a skid steer.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.519
You steer it with these.
Right brake brakes the right wheels,

24:19.520 --> 24:21.159
left brake brakes the left wheels.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.080
- Right, come on, let's go.
- All right.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.480
- Not the tent!
- INNOCENTLY: What?

24:34.320 --> 24:39.000
Eager to do some exploring,
we headed deeper into the woods.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.760
Yes, baby!

24:45.240 --> 24:49.999
And honed from over 20 years'
experience on the Siberian tundra,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.840
the SHERP is the perfect vehicle
for the job.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.239
Robust, reliable,

24:55.240 --> 24:58.879
with a reassuringly Russian attitude
to comfort.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.320
What's the suspension?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.479
Well, there really
isn't a suspension.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.000
Suspension is basically the sidewall
of the tyre.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.679
44 horsepower.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.279
44 horsepower?

25:12.280 --> 25:15.119
- Yeah.
- Dude, I've got a Peugeot hatchback with more power than that!

25:15.120 --> 25:18.120
Yeah, but can your Peugeot
hatchback do this?

25:23.640 --> 25:25.399
That is impressive.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.839
- That's pretty cool.
- That's impressive.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.399
True to its promise, the SHERP had
taken us a very long way off-road.

25:32.400 --> 25:37.079
But just when I thought we were back
to making a motoring show...

25:37.080 --> 25:38.999
OK, this is a good spot here.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.559
- Good spot for what?
- I'm going to hang up some meat,

25:42.560 --> 25:44.999
set some traps, huh?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.520
I'm sorry?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.360
Hold that.

25:52.880 --> 25:57.000
- Doughnuts? What's that?
- Hold this. - What is that? - Hold it.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.360
It's meat. Where's your knife?

26:03.120 --> 26:05.439
These two trees right here,
does that look good?

26:05.440 --> 26:09.519
I was there when Matt LeBlanc
finally lost his mind.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.039
No.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.719
What are you...?

26:12.720 --> 26:13.760
Seriously?

26:14.720 --> 26:16.559
You know what this is?

26:16.560 --> 26:18.079
This is a trail camera.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.679
It's got a motion sensor in it.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.559
When Bigfoot walks by, takes a bite
of meat, we get a picture,

26:23.560 --> 26:26.119
we buy an island, we retire.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.919
You know, people say,
"I'm going to look for him here,"

26:28.920 --> 26:30.399
"I'm going to look for him there,"

26:30.400 --> 26:33.640
but we're looking for him
right where he's going to be.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.039
On the subject of meat, hunters -
this country's full of people

26:38.040 --> 26:40.319
with guns and stuff
that go and shoot stuff.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.079
- Yeah.
- Why has no-one ever shot a Bigfoot?

26:42.080 --> 26:44.879
- They've shot a grizzly bear, haven't they?
- Yeah. - And a black bear.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.279
You know, that's a good question.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.759
I think, and this
is just my opinion,

26:47.760 --> 26:49.839
I think it's because,
let's say you're out hunting

26:49.840 --> 26:52.279
and you see a Bigfoot,
and many hunters have seen a Bigfoot

26:52.280 --> 26:54.879
and there's stories those guys will
tell where they see him,

26:54.880 --> 26:56.719
they've got
their finger on the trigger,

26:56.720 --> 26:59.479
they've got them in the sights,
and they just...

26:59.480 --> 27:02.439
Cos it has this man-like quality...

27:02.440 --> 27:04.039
they can't pull the trigger.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.839
Also, could be that
you don't believe it.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.719
Is it a guy in a suit?

27:08.720 --> 27:10.199
I don't know. Is it a hoax?

27:10.200 --> 27:13.919
I don't know. Pull the trigger,
you shoot a guy in a suit.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.999
You shoot a guy in a suit,
you're in trouble.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.279
That's murder.
Nobody wants to be a murderer.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.599
And do you really want to be the one
that shot Bigfoot?

27:20.600 --> 27:22.920
I want to be the one that has a beer
with Bigfoot.

27:26.080 --> 27:30.839
Increasingly worried where this was
all heading, I needed a distraction.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.919
Oh, it just goes anywhere.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.319
Here, look at this rock.
Go right over it.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.559
One wheel or two wheels up it?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.199
I think one wheel up, one wheel off.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.400
- OK.
- If you don't hear that big bang, we're good.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.160
You know the unstoppable SHERP?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.160
- Yeah.
- I think I just stopped it.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.680
Fortunately, it's a
lot lighter than it looks.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.959
So, if you've got an angry
half-Italian with you,

28:06.960 --> 28:08.199
it'll go anywhere!

28:08.200 --> 28:12.519
Just as I thought we'd found some
common ground in the intrepid SHERP,

28:12.520 --> 28:16.439
though, the voices in Matt's head
piped up AGAIN.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.320
All right, shut her down.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.759
What have you got in there?

28:21.760 --> 28:25.279
All right, I've got pheromones
and another trail camera.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.039
- Pheromones?
- Yeah.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.959
Pheromones. Bigfoot
is going to get a whiff of this,

28:30.960 --> 28:32.879
and he - or she - is going
to say,

28:32.880 --> 28:34.799
"What is that amazing smell?"

28:34.800 --> 28:36.479
And come running to the party.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.119
Come on, here, spread a little of
that around.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.439
Enter my territory?

28:41.440 --> 28:43.200
- Yeah. - For real?
- That's for real.

28:46.440 --> 28:50.439
OK, now I'll set the camera, huh,
comes running in,

28:50.440 --> 28:54.079
he's all excited, and we got him.

28:54.080 --> 28:58.279
Come on, let's go. I'm still driving
because this thing is so cool.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.639
Yeah, but you haven't seen
the SHERP's coolest trick yet.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.239
- What?
- You know what that is?

29:02.240 --> 29:05.519
- What is it? - It drifts.
- No, it doesn't.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.199
- Yes, it does.
- With 44 horsepower, no, it doesn't.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.600
It drifts, I'm telling you.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.640
See, drifting.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.480
It's not quite what I had in mind,
but very cool.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.160
- Have you seen him yet?
- No, not yet.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.879
Have you seen him yet?

29:31.880 --> 29:33.359
No, I haven't seen him yet.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.879
When I see him, believe me,
you'll be the first to know.

29:36.880 --> 29:37.920
OK.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.680
- What about now?
- Shut up!

29:49.480 --> 29:51.719
I've had enough of this.
This is just ridiculous.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.719
What exactly are you going to do
if you spot a Bigfoot?

29:54.720 --> 29:56.719
And it's a massive if.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.359
When we see him, you're going to gun
it full speed at the bank

30:00.360 --> 30:03.119
- and I'm going to get the rope.
- Gun it?

30:03.120 --> 30:05.839
What's the maximum speed
of the SHERP?

30:05.840 --> 30:09.879
- In the water? - Yeah.
- I don't really know.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.640
Let's open it up and find out.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.520
And immediately... there
was a problem.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.960
This is full speed?

30:21.360 --> 30:23.959
I think we're going to need
something much faster.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.119
OK. Back to camp?

30:26.120 --> 30:27.559
Yeah.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.199
So, we headed for dry land.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.160
- I love this moment.
- This is the good bit.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.960
And back at Bigfoot HQ...

30:35.120 --> 30:38.359
we ditched the SHERP
and Matt revealed the next phase

30:38.360 --> 30:40.640
of Operation
Find An Imaginary Creature.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.959
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.999
- Huh?
- Now, they are cool.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.719
OK, phase two, motocross bikes,

30:50.720 --> 30:52.999
but not just your normal motocross
bikes,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.239
these are Alta Redshifts.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.319
These are awesome.
I've heard about these.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.919
Yeah, they're supposed to be great,
and they're pure electric,

30:58.920 --> 31:00.119
so they're quiet, stealthy,

31:00.120 --> 31:02.359
just what we need for sneaking up
on Bigfoot, huh?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.439
Now, which one do you want,
the white or the yellow?

31:04.440 --> 31:07.079
- I'd really like...
- You take the white one, that's a good choice.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.599
All right, now, we've done
the Bigfoot groundwork.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.719
Now we need to get up
to higher ground.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.199
- Why?
- Do you want to ride the bikes, yes or no?

31:15.200 --> 31:16.240
Yes.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.600
So, now Matt wanted us to climb
the nearest mountain.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.720
Still, could be worse.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.600
This is so much fun!

31:31.520 --> 31:33.439
And it's so fast!

31:33.440 --> 31:36.439
Whoa-ho-ho!

31:36.440 --> 31:39.559
With backing from some of Tesla's
guys who, let's face it,

31:39.560 --> 31:42.599
know a thing or two about making
electric stuff go fast,

31:42.600 --> 31:46.719
Alta has been quietly taking
the motocross world by storm.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.759
Normally, I just hate the fact
that there's no petrol engine,

31:49.760 --> 31:51.519
but in this I just don't miss it.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.639
I don't either,
I've got to be honest.

31:53.640 --> 31:59.039
And if you're a total novice like
me, you don't have to use the gears.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.079
Yeah, there's no clutch, no nothing.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.799
Super, super smooth.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.840
I love it.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.520
But the cutting edge
of two-wheeled off-roading...

32:11.640 --> 32:13.559
That's outrageous!

32:13.560 --> 32:15.000
Does come at a premium.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.239
It's a little pricey
for a dirt bike.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.879
12 grand.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.280
For the technology,
12 grand seems like good value.

32:26.480 --> 32:30.479
Without a doubt, this is the most
impressive thing I've been on or in

32:30.480 --> 32:31.879
that has an electric motor.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.920
It's magnificent.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.320
And it's so quiet.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.280
Oh, what a thing!

32:46.360 --> 32:48.280
What a way to save the planet.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.839
This is definitely the future.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.320
I'm blown away at the performance,
I've got to say.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.919
But then...

32:58.920 --> 33:01.079
Whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop!

33:01.080 --> 33:02.919
From the sublime to...

33:02.920 --> 33:04.679
That could be Bigfoot poop.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.799
Oh, come on!

33:05.800 --> 33:08.119
I'm telling you, totally could be.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.239
He's walking along here.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.759
It's got all kinds of nuts.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.399
It looks like human food in it.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.600
Don't see any doughnut.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.000
Oh, really?

33:22.120 --> 33:23.400
- It smells like - BLEEP.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.919
Can we just get to the top of
wherever we're going, please?

33:29.920 --> 33:34.799
All right. All right, I'll tell you
what, hotshot, I'll race you.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.399
First one to the top wins.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.680
- Ready? - Yeah.
- Go!

33:42.240 --> 33:46.839
The race was on,
but straight away... I had a problem.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.079
Matt.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.999
He really is a bit handy
at this whole biking thing.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.759
Stop hitting me with rocks!

33:52.760 --> 33:56.439
- Sorry.
- I'm nothing like as good as him.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.320
But I've got two things on my side.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.799
One, sanity.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.759
Two, guile.

34:02.760 --> 34:06.079
I can feel a short cut
coming on here.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.478
But the trouble with short cuts
is...

34:08.480 --> 34:10.079
Where do we go here?

34:10.080 --> 34:11.759
There's usually a good reason

34:11.760 --> 34:13.639
why they aren't just called
"the way".

34:13.639 --> 34:16.279
Oh, this is a nightmare.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.639
Where is he?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.480
Where is he? Where is he?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.119
There he is!

34:27.120 --> 34:28.480
Where did he come from?

34:31.440 --> 34:32.839
I've got to stay ahead of him.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.359
I've got to stay ahead of him.
I can't hear him.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.879
I'm right behind you!

34:37.880 --> 34:40.478
Right, I've just got to stay
in front of him for as long

34:40.480 --> 34:42.359
as possible, haven't I?

34:42.360 --> 34:44.599
Oh, he's not looking
where he's going!

34:44.600 --> 34:47.120
Oh, I've gone wide here!

34:48.679 --> 34:52.159
Oh! Through,
on the back wheel as well!

34:52.159 --> 34:58.319
- I got him! I got him!
- You cheeky sod!

34:58.320 --> 35:02.759
Oh, the dust isn't good.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.920
Now I can't see anything.

35:06.280 --> 35:10.559
- Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- I see the top.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.199
Where's he gone?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.239
Where do you... Oh, it's up here.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.040
Please have fallen off.
Please have fallen off.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.279
No, he's not fallen off.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.320
Hey!

35:24.160 --> 35:25.200
- Oh!
- Excellent!

35:26.360 --> 35:30.080
- With a pro dismount at the top!
- Yes!

35:31.880 --> 35:35.199
We'd made it to the top
of the mountain.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.439
And as the sun set on our first day
in the forest, there was just one

35:39.440 --> 35:41.839
important job left to do.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.120
Yes,
we were going to talk to Bigfoot.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.720
OK, you have a go.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.879
- I'm sorry?
- Give it a try.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.680
Nice.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.720
There sure are a lot of places
for Bigfoot to hide out there.

36:30.600 --> 36:34.280
What would you do
if you saw a Bigfoot?

36:35.600 --> 36:38.239
Well, I guess it depends
what kind of mood he was in.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.319
- He's angry.
- Well, I guess I'd run like hell.

36:41.320 --> 36:46.119
Yeah, but it says here,
in your Bigfoot field guide,

36:46.120 --> 36:48.799
that you have no chance whatsoever

36:48.800 --> 36:51.800
of outrunning an adult male Bigfoot.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.039
Who said I had to outrun Bigfoot?

36:55.040 --> 36:56.440
I only have to outrun you.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.440
Oh, dear.

37:14.880 --> 37:19.839
And we'll pick up that utter
insanity later in the show.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.079
Oh, OK. Now it is time to put a star
in our reasonably fast car.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.599
He's an award-winning comedian,

37:25.600 --> 37:27.879
he's the star of Not Going Out

37:27.880 --> 37:32.239
and he holds two
Guinness World Records... for darts.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Lee Mack.

37:41.680 --> 37:45.600
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello. - Have a seat.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.599
- All right. Welcome. Welcome.
- I agree with you, by the way.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.359
I think Bigfoot does exist.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.919
- Good.
- It's America, isn't it? Anything can happen in America.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.159
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's your next President.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.719
All right. All right. All right.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.079
So, it's your first time here,
right?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.319
First time, yeah.

38:07.320 --> 38:10.039
And you went out on the track
with Chris for a little training.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.359
- How did that go?
- That was pretty scary.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.279
- Yeah?
- I don't know about you, but I find it quite nerve-racking

38:15.280 --> 38:18.039
if you're driving when someone grabs
the steering wheel.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.159
- He had to grab the wheel?
- He had to grab the wheel.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.840
- I hope that's what he was aiming for.
- Where were you going?

38:26.120 --> 38:28.519
Because it was hard enough
concentrating without that,

38:28.520 --> 38:30.399
- do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.320
But I did look tense, to be fair.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.720
Yeah. Let's take a look.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.439
- Lee Mack. - Hi.
- Great to have you at the Top Gear track.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.199
- It's great.
- In our reasonably fast car.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.319
- Here we go.
- Go. Remember the hand position.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.239
- Mirror, signal, indicate.
- Hand position.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.159
Oh, it's all right,
I've got a spare clutch.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.759
Right, let's go. Look at this.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.319
Remember that hand position.
Quarter to three.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.599
- Bollocks to the hand position.
- That was fifth gear.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.239
- I've gone to third too early, have I?
- You've gone to fifth.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.599
- Second to fifth.
- What do I do now?

38:58.600 --> 39:01.239
- You're going to go up to the 100m board.
- Am I in the right gear? - No,

39:01.240 --> 39:03.799
- totally the wrong gear.
- I don't mean the jeans and the shirt.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.879
Keep going round to the 100,
follow round to the 50,

39:05.880 --> 39:07.239
at the arrow we're taking a left.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.079
Do I need to worry
about brakes at this stage?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.839
- No. - Go sharp left now.
- Arrow, taking left.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.079
- Fourth gear.
- There's a man in the middle of the road!

39:13.080 --> 39:14.879
- Oh, it's a cameraman.
- Left, fourth gear.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.759
Around there. Left here.
Between the tyres.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.079
- I'm getting into this.
- Round to the right afterwards.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.479
- What do you mean?
- Don't hit the tyres. Don't hit the tyres!

39:21.480 --> 39:22.719
Over to the right-hand side.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.439
Did you pass your driving test
first time?

39:24.440 --> 39:26.199
I passed my driving test
the second time.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.279
I took it in Wales
because I was working in Wales.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.919
I got the sack, went back to London,
thought, "I've put it in now",

39:30.920 --> 39:33.759
"I might as well go back." "What did
I get the sack for?" I hear you ask.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.439
- What?
- I was a holiday camp entertainer at a caravan site.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.039
- To the left.
- And I did something I shouldn't have done!

39:39.040 --> 39:41.239
- Oh!
- I can't tell you in the car!

39:41.240 --> 39:44.079
All you have to know is, I was so
angry, I put a fish behind the sofa

39:44.080 --> 39:46.039
so the next people coming
would smell it.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.879
I talk a lot when I'm nervous.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.199
- Over here.
- What the frick are you doing with my hand?

39:50.200 --> 39:53.399
- There, go, tyres, grass. That's it.
- That cannot be allowed.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.359
I had to intervene. Over there.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.120
- What?
- This is chaos. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.080
Anyone want a lift? I've stalled it.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.639
That felt when I was in the car like
I was going like a rocket, but that

40:15.640 --> 40:17.039
hardly looked like I was moving.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.879
Sometimes when it looks slow,
it's really fast.

40:19.880 --> 40:23.719
I don't think that's one
of those times.

40:23.720 --> 40:27.039
All right, now, there is another
thing we need to talk about

40:27.040 --> 40:30.839
because what did you put in Room
101 a few years ago?

40:30.840 --> 40:31.880
Top Gear.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.560
Well, thanks for stopping by.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.799
- No, come on, what happened?
- It was a mistake.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.280
I actually meant to put in Friends.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.239
That would have made more sense.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.879
I handed them the wrong tape.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.199
- They put it in the wrong thing.
- Sometimes that happens.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.959
Right, I pointed out on the show

40:52.960 --> 40:55.079
that it wasn't Top Gear that I was
putting in.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.759
I might not be good at
driving, but I'm good at reversing

40:57.760 --> 40:59.159
into cul-de-sacs, watch this.

40:59.160 --> 41:02.439
I put in the ridiculous interest
people have in cars.

41:02.440 --> 41:05.759
I like cars but for different
reasons, perhaps, than these -

41:05.760 --> 41:06.999
let's call them lunatics.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.679
Like, I like service stations.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.399
I like a nice travel rug.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.719
I like a nodding dog.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.359
What I don't want to see is speed.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.999
It's not fast and furious, it's sort
of slow and indifferent.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.679
You're all looking at me... I feel
like I'm in a zombie film.

41:18.680 --> 41:22.079
Everyone's just staring at me,
about to get me.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.279
- Yeah.
- I like other things connected with cars.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.839
But don't you own a classic car?

41:25.840 --> 41:27.439
I do own a classic car, yeah.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.119
What is it?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.399
It's a Triumph TR4A,
which is unusual to say that

41:31.400 --> 41:33.599
after saying you're not that
interested in cars.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.319
- There it is.
- Do you still drive it?

41:35.320 --> 41:38.159
I still drive... Well,
I did until 48 hours ago

41:38.160 --> 41:41.359
because we moved house, and
on the day we moved house,

41:41.360 --> 41:43.239
it went up in flames.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.680
For insurance reasons?

41:46.640 --> 41:48.519
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't know.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.399
I'm nervous enough being on
this show anyway because I told

41:51.400 --> 41:53.279
the insurance people
I was a postman.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.519
What do you mean, it went up
in flames?

41:55.520 --> 41:58.199
- What happened?
- Well, I was moving it and I hadn't driven it

41:58.200 --> 41:59.839
for a few weeks, and I was thinking,

41:59.840 --> 42:03.160
"Why isn't it starting,
and why am I smelling fire?"

42:04.480 --> 42:06.399
Those two things were connected,
I found out.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.719
- Yeah?
- The engine was on fire, but I didn't realise,

42:08.720 --> 42:11.199
so I popped the bonnet.
Pop! Like that.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.319
- But it doesn't come up, does it? It goes... Pop!
- Ah.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.119
I had to get my fingers
underneath it. It was boiling hot!

42:16.120 --> 42:17.839
I was trying to find the... Ah, ah!

42:17.840 --> 42:21.639
I eventually got it open and then me
and my son, we'd packed everything,

42:21.640 --> 42:25.799
we were moving. So, an empty pint
bottle, milk bottle, in, fill it up,

42:25.800 --> 42:28.399
run out... In and out...

42:28.400 --> 42:31.399
It took a good few minutes before
we managed to put that fire out.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.680
- Damage?
- Well, he burned his hand but, you know, what the hell?

42:36.680 --> 42:39.439
All right, there's a new series
of Not Going Out, yeah?

42:39.440 --> 42:42.679
There is a new series.
Thursday nights, nine o'clock.

42:42.680 --> 42:45.919
And in fact, I'm already writing
the one for the new series

42:45.920 --> 42:47.680
next year, and genuinely true...

42:48.960 --> 42:51.159
This probably isn't the time
or place,

42:51.160 --> 42:53.200
but I have written an episode
where...

42:54.400 --> 42:57.079
a good-looking American man

42:57.080 --> 42:58.639
moves in next door

42:58.640 --> 43:01.120
and my wife takes a shine to him.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.520
And I was wondering...

43:05.880 --> 43:08.759
if you've got David Schwimmer's
number.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.960
I was wondering
if you would like to...

43:15.160 --> 43:17.999
I mean, obviously we wouldn't hold
you to it, but it would be a sort of

43:18.000 --> 43:22.079
verbal contract - whether
you would come and do the show.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.160
What do you think? I'm not asking
Chris, no disrespect.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.479
- Yeah.
- I haven't got a lazy eye.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.079
I'm aiming this at you,
Matt LeBlanc.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.239
You're seriously asking me
to come and do your show?

43:31.240 --> 43:34.039
I'm asking you to do one episode of
my sitcom Not Going Out to be filmed

43:34.040 --> 43:36.079
any time between 1st of December,
mid-February.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.759
I mean, we don't have to get into
the admin now, but I have brought a

43:38.760 --> 43:41.239
contract if you'd like to sign it.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.639
- OK.
- Yes!

43:42.640 --> 43:43.680
He's in!

43:48.680 --> 43:52.359
And by the end of the episode,
we prove the existence of Bigfoot.

43:52.360 --> 43:53.679
- I'm in.
- Right, there you go.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.839
I am in. All right, shall we see
a clip of Not Going Out?

43:55.840 --> 43:57.999
- Please do, yeah.
- All right, let's show the clip.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.839
- Bridge!
- Mum, he's trying to annoy me.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.199
That's because all men are hideous!

44:03.200 --> 44:04.879
- Bridge!
- Stop it, Charlie.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.279
It's not bridge!

44:06.280 --> 44:07.839
Can we all stop shouting, please?

44:07.840 --> 44:09.959
- Bridge!
- She just said it's not bridge!

44:09.960 --> 44:11.199
I feel sick!

44:11.200 --> 44:13.639
- But, Daddy...
- Yes, Charlie, what is it?

44:13.640 --> 44:15.440
Bridge!

44:23.600 --> 44:26.719
Well, that, you see,

44:26.720 --> 44:29.399
that is the reality of cars,
isn't it? That's the reality.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.399
When you've got three kids, I don't
care what the suspension's like.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.839
The kids being in the car overpowers
everything about cars.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.719
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but if you give them a comfortable car with great

44:37.720 --> 44:39.359
suspension, they give you less pain.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.199
You haven't met my kids, have you?

44:41.200 --> 44:43.639
All right, I think we should get
down to business.

44:43.640 --> 44:44.879
OK, I'm nervous about this.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.639
Time to see your lap.
How do you think you did?

44:47.640 --> 44:49.359
I reckon I'm in the top two.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.559
- Top two?
- Yeah, of all time.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.919
Judging by that training video,
I would say...

44:54.920 --> 44:56.880
that's a stretch.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.240
Let's have a look and see.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.919
OK, good off the line,
but then a bit of a stumble there.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.879
Right, just remember,
if you go fast,

45:06.880 --> 45:08.639
girls find you more attractive.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.240
That's not true.

45:11.560 --> 45:16.079
OK, following round now, cheeky
line, you cut the corner a bit.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.599
You're running wide.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.279
Whoa! I've lost control
of the mother chuffer!

45:20.280 --> 45:22.360
I'm back in control.
Everyone, calm down.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.479
Oh, you beast!

45:27.480 --> 45:29.359
Get in there! Right, go, go, go!

45:29.360 --> 45:30.599
Round Chicago.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.599
Quite wide.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.719
And you appear to be in about
eighth gear.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.639
Go up here now, just keep
accelerating, sunshine.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.560
Don't worry about your health
and safety.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.400
Hammerhead.
I'd say, steady and safe.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.999
It's all right, for you, isn't it,
LeBlanc,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.319
with your feet up in the studio?

45:51.320 --> 45:53.200
I'd get out of the way if I was you,
mate!

45:55.320 --> 45:57.680
Oh! I could do with a drinks break.

46:04.880 --> 46:07.079
Oh, my God!

46:07.080 --> 46:09.359
Second to last,
the trickiest corner, for me.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.880
Why isn't there any road signs
in this place?

46:14.200 --> 46:16.320
And over the line
in a controlled manner.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.239
I'd like to change my statement

46:23.240 --> 46:25.559
and say that there are
some very sensible girls out there

46:25.560 --> 46:26.759
that now find me attractive.

46:26.760 --> 46:28.679
- That was sensible driving, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

46:28.680 --> 46:29.759
Some of the racing greats

46:29.760 --> 46:32.559
have always looked slow, but they
were going fast. Alain Prost.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.319
They made it look easy, and maybe,
just maybe, you're in that camp.

46:36.320 --> 46:41.039
Yeah, I don't think I've ever been
patronised as much as that moment.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.239
Leaderboard, what do you think?

46:43.240 --> 46:45.439
If you had to make a prediction,
where would you be?

46:45.440 --> 46:48.199
I'm going to say it starts
with a one, yeah?

46:48.200 --> 46:49.999
Tell me, yeah,
that's all I want to hear.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.159
- It starts with a one. - Come on!
- Yeah!

46:53.160 --> 46:55.479
- All right, you did it...
- I'm going 1...

46:55.480 --> 46:57.599
49.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.719
Am I way off?

46:59.720 --> 47:01.879
You can't just make up your own
time.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.359
Let's put me down for a 1:49.
Ladies and gentlemen,

47:04.360 --> 47:07.320
you've been a lovely audience,
see you next week on Top Gear.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.679
I love it.
- 1:49.

47:12.680 --> 47:13.799
- What is it?
- It's so funny.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.679
This is like my favourite part, to
hold this and watch people squirm.

47:16.680 --> 47:18.519
- You are evil, aren't you?
- Yeah, I really am.

47:18.520 --> 47:23.279
- Yeah.
- All right, Lee Mack, you did it in a 1:55...

47:23.280 --> 47:24.799
What?!

47:24.800 --> 47:26.160
- Behind...
- Can I finish?

47:27.680 --> 47:31.680
In a 1:55.2.

47:35.800 --> 47:39.520
- That puts you... right there.
- Wow.

47:41.840 --> 47:43.439
Wow.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.559
- But you had fun. - I had fun.
- You had fun. That's all that matters.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.919
It's relegation zone,
but that's all right.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.360
Ladies and gentlemen, Lee Mack.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.559
Now, let's talk city cars.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.279
There are loads of them out there,
but they all pretty much look

48:03.280 --> 48:05.239
the same and cost
pretty much the same.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.799
So, how do you choose which one
you should buy?

48:07.800 --> 48:10.079
0-60? Not important,
you're in a city.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.999
Top speed? Not important,
you're in a city.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.639
But I have a foolproof method
to decide which city car to buy,

48:16.640 --> 48:20.160
and earlier today I headed out
on to our track to demonstrate.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.799
There's only one thing that matters
in a city car.

48:24.800 --> 48:26.279
Reverse parking.

48:26.280 --> 48:29.199
So, we're going to have
a reversing race.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.319
One lap of the Top Gear short track.

48:31.320 --> 48:36.359
Hammerhead, the follow-through,
and Chicago... backwards.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.639
With windows completely blacked out,

48:38.640 --> 48:41.680
we'll been navigating by rear-view
camera alone.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.920
I'll be in the Suzuki Swift, and
driving the Ford Fiesta, Mr Happy.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.799
Well, this is absolute madness.

48:50.800 --> 48:54.119
I mean, he's had bad ideas
in the past, and dangerous ideas.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.599
But this combines both.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.719
Are you ready?
This is going to be great.

48:58.720 --> 49:00.999
This is going to be anything
but great.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.520
- Three, two, one...
- What the...? - Reverse!

49:08.680 --> 49:10.439
No, no, no, no, no!

49:10.440 --> 49:11.759
Oh!

49:11.760 --> 49:13.839
No! Completely lost it.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.159
I don't know where I am.
I have no idea where I am.

49:16.160 --> 49:18.200
Oh, it's going a bit quicker
than I thought!

49:19.760 --> 49:21.479
Oh, my God.

49:21.480 --> 49:24.279
Hunt him down. Here we go. Oh!

49:24.280 --> 49:26.759
- Bollocks. - Oh,
- BLEEP - hell.

49:26.760 --> 49:30.119
Sorry! No, no, no, no, no!

49:30.120 --> 49:32.119
Oh! Oh! No!

49:32.120 --> 49:36.199
I can't tell you how
fast 37 feels going backwards!

49:36.200 --> 49:38.359
- Holy - BLEEP!

49:38.360 --> 49:40.279
Whoops.

49:40.280 --> 49:45.119
Here we go. Here we go. Now,
I don't actually know where I am.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.560
I was using him as a guide.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.599
Is this right?

49:50.600 --> 49:53.039
I reckon the finish line
is about there.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.960
Yes! Rory Reid, nailed.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.600
Have I won?

49:59.880 --> 50:02.319
- I won, right?
- No.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.479
- Who won?
- No, you came second.

50:04.480 --> 50:06.399
Oh. What have we learned?

50:06.400 --> 50:09.399
We've learned that if you want
to have a backwards race in a car

50:09.400 --> 50:11.359
that you can't see out of the front
of,

50:11.360 --> 50:13.279
the Fiesta's the superior vehicle.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.759
- I'm going to agree with that.
- Yeah.

50:14.760 --> 50:17.759
And if you want a car
with a reversing camera

50:17.760 --> 50:21.559
that's basically the quality
of a pirate VHS, then, yeah,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.159
- go for the Swift.
- Right, let's go.

50:23.160 --> 50:24.919
- I feel a bit sick.
- I'm not surprised.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.239
- I'm going to walk.
- That's a good point.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.840
I can't see out of it. Let's leave
it there. I'll walk too.

50:34.520 --> 50:36.959
OK, now, earlier on, we were
in the California woods

50:36.960 --> 50:41.000
- with a whole bunch of off-road toys.
- And an invisible gorilla.

50:42.280 --> 50:45.240
Why do you have to be like that?
We agreed not to use the G word.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.119
Let's just get back to the film,

50:48.120 --> 50:50.320
where the hunt was about to get
a lot more serious.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.000
You're an asshole.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.880
Daybreak in the wilderness.

51:01.480 --> 51:04.400
Predictably enough,
our bait traps lay undisturbed.

51:05.760 --> 51:10.079
Nevertheless, I had woken early,
wondering what new madness Matt had

51:10.080 --> 51:12.320
planned in his hunt for Bigfoot.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.679
OK, the story so far.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.119
No sleep at all last night
cos the bugs are really,

51:20.120 --> 51:21.239
really big and angry.

51:21.240 --> 51:24.519
As for the noises, there's some
terrible noises out in the woods.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.639
I mean, I don't believe
in the Bigfoot thing,

51:26.640 --> 51:28.960
but big, loud, angry noises.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.960
- Don't forget to floss.
- Jesus!

51:38.920 --> 51:42.079
- How long have you been there?
- A long time.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.719
What are you doing?!

51:43.720 --> 51:46.199
Getting serious
about finding Bigfoot.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.960
You've lost your mind!

51:49.440 --> 51:51.359
It's on.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.679
Time to bring out the big guns.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.720
Come on.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.119
Showtime. You wait there.

51:57.120 --> 51:59.200
Something had triggered
my bait traps.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.159
And if it was what I thought it was,

52:02.160 --> 52:04.240
I had just the tools
to track it down.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.160
Oh, yeah.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.319
For me.

52:11.320 --> 52:13.279
Cool, right? That thing's awesome.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.960
Look at the suspension on it!

52:16.040 --> 52:17.240
What has he got for me?

52:18.960 --> 52:20.640
How big is that trailer?!

52:21.880 --> 52:23.639
- And who's that guy?
- Come on, let's go.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.799
No, no, no, no, no. Wait there.
Who's this guy here?

52:25.800 --> 52:28.519
- Has he been in there the whole time?
- Yeah, yeah, he's very patient.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.039
That's Stuart, he's your pilot.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.759
You're going to be my eyes
in the sky.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.799
Why does an ATV need a pilot,
Matt?

52:33.800 --> 52:35.999
- It flies.
- It flies?

52:36.000 --> 52:37.719
- Yeah.
- I hate flying.

52:37.720 --> 52:38.839
I know. Come on, let's go.

52:38.840 --> 52:41.559
You find some open ground and big
Stu will take care of the rest.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.160
Go, go, go, go. Go!

53:01.800 --> 53:06.959
This is the Can-Am X3 XRS Turbo R.

53:06.960 --> 53:11.120
This is the fastest, most extreme
ATV you can buy right now.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.679
0-60 in under five seconds,
on the dirt.

53:17.680 --> 53:20.799
Flat-out, it'll do about 90mph.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.080
It's quick!

53:24.640 --> 53:27.560
At 20 grand, the Maverick
isn't exactly cheap.

53:28.760 --> 53:30.479
But, trust me,

53:30.480 --> 53:32.880
you'll be having way too much fun
to care.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.839
I love this thing!

53:35.840 --> 53:39.399
There's these big bumps
and I feel like I should lift,

53:39.400 --> 53:44.279
but I don't need to, I can carry
flat-out speed through all of this.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.919
It's incredible.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.800
Wow.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.920
And this is the SkyRunner.

53:57.920 --> 54:00.439
Nowhere near as fast
as the Maverick,

54:00.440 --> 54:04.879
but £100,000 does apparently
buy you a flying car.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.679
That is quite a concept.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.519
And finding some flat ground,

54:10.520 --> 54:15.199
it was time for big Stu
to do whatever it is he does.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.200
Right, I think this is where you
take over, OK?

54:19.200 --> 54:22.839
This might be the time to tell you
that I don't like flying much.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.599
Especially when all the important
bits appear to have come

54:26.600 --> 54:28.920
from a camping shop.
Anything else I should know?

54:31.720 --> 54:34.840
In case of emergency,
your exits are here and here.

54:37.240 --> 54:38.280
I'm not sure about this.

54:39.600 --> 54:43.240
But big Stu... was.

54:46.120 --> 54:49.160
That's quite potent there.

55:01.560 --> 55:03.240
Oh, my Lord!

55:07.400 --> 55:08.920
Ho-ho-ho!

55:12.360 --> 55:15.240
Wow! Wow!

55:17.600 --> 55:20.800
It's a flying car.
It's a flying car!

55:27.080 --> 55:31.399
There's a point at which fascination
meets terror,

55:31.400 --> 55:34.040
and I'm slightly there.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.519
Whoa.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.679
That's a bit close to the trees.

55:39.680 --> 55:43.200
Meanwhile, back IN the trees...

55:45.720 --> 55:50.599
- Hey, Chris, how's it going up there, buddy?
- The world has gone mad...

55:50.600 --> 55:52.519
in a really good way!

55:52.520 --> 55:55.599
All right, well, I need you to tell
me where that thing is.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.360
Where are you? Where are you?

56:00.000 --> 56:05.879
- OK, I've got two trails of dust down there.
- How far away am I?

56:05.880 --> 56:08.919
About 400 metres ahead of you.

56:08.920 --> 56:11.079
OK, OK, I think I can close that.

56:11.080 --> 56:13.759
I don't know what it is,
but it's fast.

56:13.760 --> 56:15.959
It's furiously fast.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.919
Which way do I go up here?

56:17.920 --> 56:19.679
OK, it's a left turn.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.480
- A left turn.
- Left?

56:24.800 --> 56:27.759
- 300 metres. - 300 metres, OK, good.

56:27.760 --> 56:30.360
- Next right. You've got to take the next right.
- Got it!

56:32.200 --> 56:36.719
- 200 metres.
- Are you sure I'm on the right road? - 100 metres.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.039
I don't see any dust yet.

56:38.040 --> 56:39.919
You're heading straight for it.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.239
But then we discovered
it wasn't Bigfoot

56:42.240 --> 56:43.999
that had triggered the alarm,

56:44.000 --> 56:45.240
it was something else.

56:54.960 --> 56:57.599
Whoa. What is that?

56:57.600 --> 57:00.040
Chris, can you see what it is?

57:01.080 --> 57:04.240
What is it? All I can see is dust.

57:05.600 --> 57:08.479
Determined to find out
who had been messing with my traps,

57:08.480 --> 57:10.599
we gave chase.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.640
I can't see good enough
to get any closer.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.599
You've got to speed up.
You've got to speed up, mate.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.599
It's shooting grapefruit-size
rocks at me.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.559
Whoa. This is...

57:22.560 --> 57:24.680
This is so sketchy.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.639
I'm going to have to back off.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.519
We're not going to catch him
like this.

57:30.520 --> 57:33.239
We're not going to catch him
like this. We need to land.

57:33.240 --> 57:36.839
- We need to get down there to block him off.
- Good idea.

57:36.840 --> 57:38.919
Land that thing.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.479
So, we sped ahead of the dust trails
and found a clearing.

57:41.480 --> 57:45.680
OK, here comes the landing.
Here comes the landing.

57:49.680 --> 57:51.040
I'm going to hold on.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.839
And...

57:53.840 --> 57:55.679
Ooh-ho-ho!

57:55.680 --> 57:57.439
There we go.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.280
Right, let's get out of here.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.759
I'll just leave you to...

58:03.760 --> 58:05.160
Thank you. Sorry.

58:11.600 --> 58:14.239
With Chris now back
in his comfort zone...

58:14.240 --> 58:17.759
- Woo-hoo-hoo! - ..I kept up the pursuit
from the rear and he closed in

58:17.760 --> 58:20.119
- from the front.
- All right, I'm coming.

58:20.120 --> 58:22.840
- I'm coming. - OK, great.
- Where is he?

58:24.520 --> 58:25.880
Come on.

58:28.440 --> 58:30.960
And finally, with our trap set...

58:34.480 --> 58:36.039
What is that?

58:36.040 --> 58:37.440
There was nowhere else to run.

58:39.240 --> 58:40.880
Oh, we got you.

58:47.880 --> 58:49.800
- Whoa!
- Did you see that?

59:02.920 --> 59:04.200
It's the Stig.

59:07.400 --> 59:10.880
No, it isn't. I get it.
It's Stigfoot.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.719
The producers, unbelievable.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.320
They're having a laugh, aren't they?

59:34.440 --> 59:36.960
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah.

59:45.040 --> 59:49.399
I'll tell you, those were
such cool vehicles.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.439
So cool. And you know what my
favourite was?

59:51.440 --> 59:52.679
The electric dirt bikes.

59:52.680 --> 59:54.279
The Altas. How cool were those?

59:54.280 --> 59:56.519
So fast and so quiet.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.719
- Yeah.
- You could hear the birds chirping,

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.679
you could hear the rustle
in the bushes.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.279
You could hear the crack of Chris's
head on the rock when he fell off.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.959
- They were great.
- They are the future.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.839
- Yeah. - And what about the SHERP, though?
- Oh. - It's unstoppable.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.719
You could invade a country
with that thing.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.679
Yeah, and, like a good one too,
like a Sweden.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.199
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.199
I love all the off-road stuff,
that was great.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.919
But I need to know, at the end,
what was in the bushes?

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.319
- What did you see?
- I don't know, Chris.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.919
- What did you see?
- I don't know what I saw.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.239
But it was something, right?

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.759
- Was it a bear?
- No.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.799
- Was it a gorilla?
- No.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.239
- Was it big?
- Yes.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.679
- Did it have feet?
- Yes.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.919
That's good enough for me.
You're in the club.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.559
You're next. OK, that's all we have
time for tonight.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.119
On next week's show, it's all about
Japan

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.599
as we explore the weird
and wonderful cars

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.519
from the Land of the Rising Sun.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.920
See you then. Good night.
