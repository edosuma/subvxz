02:43.676 --> 02:45.181
No!

02:53.880 --> 02:56.209
Get me Agent Chester Desmond...

02:56.247 --> 02:58.276
out in Fargo, North Dakota!

03:13.775 --> 03:15.654
Gene, come over here
and help out.

03:16.357 --> 03:17.357
I'll get the phone.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.946
- Hello.
- Chet...

03:27.029 --> 03:29.107
I'm calling you
from Portland, Oregon!

03:29.264 --> 03:31.880
It's Regional
Bureau Chief Gordon Cole...

03:31.920 --> 03:33.803
calling from Portland, Oregon!

03:34.557 --> 03:35.950
Okay, Gordon.

03:36.370 --> 03:37.837
Oregon!

03:38.908 --> 03:40.348
I've got a girl
that's been murdered!

03:40.581 --> 03:42.380
Seventeen years old!

03:42.652 --> 03:44.772
Named Teresa Banks!

03:45.553 --> 03:47.472
Chet, I've got a surprise for you!

03:47.630 --> 03:50.030
Something interesting
I would like to show you!

03:50.349 --> 03:52.471
Arrangements are being made...

03:52.620 --> 03:55.304
and I will meet you at
the private Portland...

03:55.386 --> 03:56.346
airport!

03:56.594 --> 03:57.874
Okay, Gordon.

04:35.421 --> 04:38.104
- Chet! Good to see you.
- Hi, Gordon.

04:38.895 --> 04:41.112
Chet, give Sam Stanley
the glad hand.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.992
He's come over from Spokane!

04:43.034 --> 04:44.884
It's a pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you.

04:45.149 --> 04:47.378
Sam's the man who cracked
the Whitman case!

04:47.754 --> 04:49.411
Congratulations.

04:49.439 --> 04:50.904
I heard about that!

04:52.083 --> 04:53.962
Chet, your surprise!

04:55.976 --> 04:58.215
Her name is Lil!

05:03.363 --> 05:05.563
She's my mother's sister's girl.

05:07.886 --> 05:08.846
Federal.

05:14.045 --> 05:14.965
Good luck, Chet!

05:16.463 --> 05:17.919
Sam, you stick with Chet!

05:17.938 --> 05:21.679
He's got his own m.o.!
Modus operandi!

05:22.790 --> 05:25.017
You fellas can reach me
in the Philadelphia offices!

05:25.226 --> 05:26.546
I'm flying out today!

05:31.564 --> 05:32.403
That really was something...

05:32.420 --> 05:34.539
with the dancing girl,
wasn't it?

05:34.985 --> 05:36.585
What exactly did that mean?

05:36.840 --> 05:38.080
I'll explain it to you.

05:39.258 --> 05:41.458
Remember Lil's
wearing a sour face.

05:41.858 --> 05:43.457
What do you mean?

05:45.363 --> 05:47.642
Her face had a sour look on it.

05:50.021 --> 05:52.820
We're going to have problems
with the local authorities.

05:53.068 --> 05:55.468
They're not going to be
receptive to the FBI.

05:56.242 --> 05:58.886
Both eyes blinking
means trouble higher up.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.720
The eye is the local authority.

06:01.251 --> 06:03.137
Sheriff and a Deputy
would be my guess.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.420
You notice she had
one hand in her pocket...

06:05.793 --> 06:07.472
which means
they're hiding something.

06:08.259 --> 06:09.619
And the other hand
made into a fist...

06:09.659 --> 06:11.498
which means they'll be belligerent.

06:12.091 --> 06:13.727
Lil was walking in place...

06:13.975 --> 06:16.608
which means there's
a lot of leg work involved.

06:18.015 --> 06:21.736
Cole said Lil was
his mother's sister's girl.

06:22.558 --> 06:24.175
Now, what's missing
in that sentence?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.193
The uncle.

06:26.527 --> 06:28.434
Not Cole's uncle...
but probably the Sheriff's uncle...

06:28.454 --> 06:29.734
is in federal prison.

06:29.927 --> 06:31.487
Let me ask you something, Stanley.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.112
Did you notice
anything about the dress?

06:34.249 --> 06:35.646
The dress was altered
to fit her.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.335
I noticed a different
color thread...

06:37.353 --> 06:39.192
where it was taken in.

06:40.839 --> 06:42.703
Gordon said you were good.

06:44.473 --> 06:46.193
Tailored dress
is our code for drugs.

06:49.155 --> 06:50.235
You notice what was pinned to it?

06:55.552 --> 06:56.854
A blue rose?

07:01.581 --> 07:02.815
Good.

07:04.064 --> 07:05.423
But I can't tell you about that.

07:07.266 --> 07:08.347
You can't?

07:10.548 --> 07:11.988
No, I can't.

07:51.876 --> 07:53.213
Good afternoon.

07:53.410 --> 07:54.791
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

07:55.671 --> 07:57.071
Special Agent Chet Desmond.

07:57.111 --> 07:58.751
I'd like to see
Sheriff Cable, please.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.683
Why don't you have a seat
over there with your partner?

08:10.001 --> 08:11.093
Make yourself at home,

08:11.357 --> 08:12.565
because it'll be a while.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.282
Why don't you have some coffee?
Go ahead.

08:28.293 --> 08:29.933
It was fresh about two days ago.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.626
- I've had enough of the waiting room now.
- Is that so?

08:48.719 --> 08:49.679
Don't move.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.171
You can start that fresh pot
of coffee right now.

09:11.394 --> 09:13.753
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Federal Bureau of Investigation.

09:13.932 --> 09:15.652
Special Agent Chet Desmond.

09:16.737 --> 09:18.937
I'm here to investigate
the murder of Teresa Banks.

09:20.781 --> 09:23.402
Well, little fella...

09:23.461 --> 09:25.700
we don't need any
outside help around here.

09:27.689 --> 09:29.446
I don't like you people sniffing around...

09:29.486 --> 09:31.389
in my neck of the woods.

09:31.636 --> 09:34.091
In fact, when the state boys called me...

09:34.195 --> 09:37.274
about a J. Edgar coming up,

09:37.637 --> 09:41.411
I think I said, "So what?"

09:45.734 --> 09:47.174
It's all right, Deputy.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.538
Sheriff Cable
can handle it from here.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.375
Cliff.

09:57.507 --> 09:59.387
Your behavior is not funny.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.586
It's wasting the time
of the federal government.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.379
You're lucky
I'm not wasting you.

10:07.962 --> 10:11.125
Well, little fella,
let me put it this way.

10:11.405 --> 10:13.561
The operative word here
would be "federal."

10:13.719 --> 10:15.160
I'm now ordering you to release...

10:15.201 --> 10:17.561
all pertinent information
concerning Teresa Banks,

10:17.708 --> 10:19.747
both while living and deceased.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.446
Your basic kill.

10:30.875 --> 10:33.595
Banks was a drifter,
and nobody knew her.

10:33.872 --> 10:36.272
Where's the body?

10:37.112 --> 10:40.192
It's out in back in our morgue.

10:41.463 --> 10:44.782
It's 4:30. We close at 5:00.

10:45.298 --> 10:46.882
We have our own clock.

10:46.894 --> 10:48.333
We'll lock up.

11:17.846 --> 11:19.508
You know, Agent Desmond,

11:20.013 --> 11:21.842
I figure this whole office,
furniture included,

11:22.232 --> 11:23.791
is worth $27,000.

11:41.343 --> 11:43.462
Teresa Banks.

11:43.798 --> 11:45.917
Teresa Banks lived at the
Fat Trout Trailer Park...

11:46.422 --> 11:47.942
for a month.

11:48.665 --> 11:50.050
We'll check that.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.587
Worked as a waitress
at Hap's Diner.

11:54.845 --> 11:56.885
Worked the night shift.

11:57.558 --> 11:59.917
Good place for dinner
when we're through here, Sam.

12:04.243 --> 12:05.683
No one came to claim the body.

12:09.544 --> 12:10.624
No known next of kin.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.807
Crushed skull.

12:29.780 --> 12:30.710
Probable cause,

12:30.718 --> 12:32.598
repeated blows
to the back of the head...

12:32.927 --> 12:35.437
by a blunt,
obtuse-angled object.

12:39.442 --> 12:41.282
I wonder where her ring is.

12:43.359 --> 12:47.030
Personal effects include
a watch, undergarment,

12:47.134 --> 12:48.653
pink waitress uniform.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.834
The ring's missing.

13:02.837 --> 13:04.877
Seems to be
an interesting contusion...

13:06.526 --> 13:08.845
under the ring finger
of the left hand.

13:10.525 --> 13:11.564
Accidental?

13:32.389 --> 13:36.300
Agent Desmond, could you hold
the finger for me, please?

13:41.281 --> 13:42.976
There's something in there.

13:47.502 --> 13:48.461
Yes...

13:51.132 --> 13:53.917
What is it?

13:54.405 --> 13:55.885
It's a piece of white paper...

13:57.588 --> 13:59.030
with the letter "T"
imprinted on it.

13:59.043 --> 14:00.388
Come here. Take a look.

14:27.237 --> 14:29.523
Agent Desmond,
it's 3:30 in the morning.

14:29.742 --> 14:30.930
Where are we going to sleep?

14:32.169 --> 14:33.169
We're not.

14:33.284 --> 14:34.804
You and I're going
to get some food.

14:39.022 --> 14:41.103
Ask Irene about that.

14:41.164 --> 14:43.014
Irene out there.

14:43.908 --> 14:46.558
Now, Irene is her name,
and it is night.

14:46.643 --> 14:48.523
Don't go any further with it.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.258
There's nothing good about it.

14:53.794 --> 14:55.235
Thank you, Jack.

14:58.613 --> 15:00.952
How's it going
with that goddamn lamp?

15:12.826 --> 15:14.903
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.383
Special Agent Chet Desmond.

15:19.366 --> 15:20.742
I'd like to ask a few questions...

15:20.761 --> 15:22.080
about Teresa Banks.

15:22.324 --> 15:23.724
Jack said you knew her.

15:24.677 --> 15:26.157
How well?

15:29.956 --> 15:32.909
She only worked here a month.

15:33.293 --> 15:34.643
Nice girl.

15:35.842 --> 15:38.682
Never seemed
to get here on time, though.

15:39.548 --> 15:40.861
You ask me,

15:40.988 --> 15:43.387
she had a little problem with...

15:45.688 --> 15:48.100
Did you ever see
Teresa Banks take cocaine?

15:51.853 --> 15:53.295
No.

15:54.595 --> 15:56.982
Do you ever take cocaine, Irene?

15:57.078 --> 15:58.997
No, I do not.

15:59.186 --> 16:02.025
I never took cocaine
or any other drug.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.944
I don't take drugs.

16:06.164 --> 16:07.987
Nicotine's a drug.

16:08.026 --> 16:09.668
Caffeine's a drug.

16:09.931 --> 16:11.539
Who's the towhead?

16:12.287 --> 16:14.326
Those drugs are legal.

16:15.732 --> 16:17.028
He's with me.

16:19.651 --> 16:21.587
Anything you'd like to
tell us about Teresa Banks...

16:21.630 --> 16:23.030
that might help us out?

16:24.508 --> 16:26.134
I've been thinking about that.

16:27.742 --> 16:29.649
You ask me...

16:30.133 --> 16:33.412
her death was what you'd call...

16:34.608 --> 16:36.448
a freak accident.

16:42.273 --> 16:43.476
Thanks.

16:44.113 --> 16:46.330
Are you talking about
that little girl...

16:46.389 --> 16:48.778
that got murdered?

16:49.205 --> 16:50.845
You got something to tell us?

16:51.550 --> 16:54.469
I know shit from shinola.

16:59.218 --> 17:03.065
Agent Desmond, do you think
we should question him?

17:09.711 --> 17:11.742
What time is it, Stanley?

17:16.219 --> 17:18.618
It's late, Sam.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.243
I'm sorry.

17:20.422 --> 17:21.342
It's early.

17:21.604 --> 17:23.003
It's really early.

17:23.344 --> 17:27.583
You know, I never told anybody this,

17:27.837 --> 17:30.638
but once, for about three days,

17:30.989 --> 17:32.829
just before her time,

17:34.185 --> 17:37.425
Teresa's arm went completely dead.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.274
What do you mean?

17:39.507 --> 17:40.976
Her left arm...

17:41.458 --> 17:43.258
it was numb.

17:43.744 --> 17:46.277
She said she couldn't use it.

17:46.484 --> 17:49.573
Probably those drugs
she was taking.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.162
I just thought
I ought to tell you.

17:55.286 --> 17:56.246
Thanks.

17:56.332 --> 17:58.553
Are you talking about
that little girl...

17:58.610 --> 18:00.764
that got murdered?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.961
I doubt it was a drug problem.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.550
It was probably a nerve problem.

18:07.269 --> 18:10.108
I could recheck the arm
for injuries,

18:10.363 --> 18:11.850
but I'd have to take
the body back to Portland...

18:11.881 --> 18:14.342
to do some real nerve work.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.713
I think that's a good idea, Sam.

18:26.483 --> 18:29.185
We'd like to order
some food, please.

18:29.236 --> 18:32.036
You want to hear
about our specials?

18:34.734 --> 18:36.374
We don't have any.

18:46.608 --> 18:48.197
What?

18:48.389 --> 18:49.829
What is it?

18:50.298 --> 18:51.953
- What?!
- Nine.

18:52.183 --> 18:53.188
Can't you read?

18:53.245 --> 18:55.238
It's really late.
We're really early.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.453
Damn, this better be important.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.869
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

18:58.921 --> 19:01.280
Special Agent Chet Desmond,
Agent Sam Stanley.

19:01.921 --> 19:03.011
Sorry to disturb you, but...

19:03.203 --> 19:05.555
we need to see
Teresa Banks' trailer, please.

19:05.781 --> 19:07.661
Shit.

19:08.513 --> 19:10.452
That goddamn trailer
is more popular...

19:10.473 --> 19:12.157
than Uncle's Day
in a whorehouse.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.593
You see what I mean?

19:14.072 --> 19:17.274
It just means more shit
I got to do now.

19:20.842 --> 19:22.183
Damn it!

19:35.223 --> 19:36.937
Everything's exactly
like she left it.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.360
Haven't touched a goddamn thing!

19:39.990 --> 19:41.429
God!

19:51.607 --> 19:53.367
Take a look at this.

19:58.672 --> 20:00.074
She's got the ring on.

20:02.711 --> 20:05.096
I'm gonna make myself a cup
of Good Morning, America.

20:05.193 --> 20:06.708
Y'all want some?

20:07.146 --> 20:08.574
Please.

20:31.745 --> 20:33.145
Here you go, boys.

20:33.861 --> 20:35.773
- Good Morning, America.
- Thanks.

20:37.473 --> 20:38.710
Thank you.

20:42.884 --> 20:43.739
You weren't kidding, man.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.671
This stuff's got the sting
of the forty-eight-hour blend.

20:46.783 --> 20:47.555
That's right.

20:47.581 --> 20:48.857
It's the best
goddamn coffee...

20:48.912 --> 20:50.153
you're going to get anywhere, buddy.

20:50.279 --> 20:51.463
We sure do need
a good wake-me-up,

20:51.530 --> 20:54.049
don't we, Agent Desmond?

20:54.491 --> 20:56.122
We sure do need a good wake-me-up,
don't we, Agent Desmond?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.338
Yeah, we do, Sam.

21:25.016 --> 21:27.016
Did you know Teresa Banks?

22:15.874 --> 22:18.234
See, I've already gone places.

22:24.586 --> 22:26.746
I just want to stay where I am.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.886
What the hell's
that thing doing out there?

23:01.639 --> 23:04.038
You're not taking
that body anywhere.

23:08.618 --> 23:10.889
We're taking the body
back to Portland.

23:10.997 --> 23:13.836
There's not a thing
you can do about it.

23:19.059 --> 23:21.219
Teresa Banks had a ring.

23:21.471 --> 23:23.275
Any idea what happened to it?

23:27.131 --> 23:29.011
We got a phone here.

23:29.298 --> 23:31.433
It's got a little ring.

23:42.820 --> 23:45.219
Take that van back
to Portland, Stanley.

23:45.487 --> 23:47.998
I'm going to take one more look
at the trailer park.

23:48.378 --> 23:50.531
Agent Desmond...

23:50.990 --> 23:52.591
one thing has been troubling me...

23:53.227 --> 23:55.186
the blue rose.

23:55.870 --> 23:58.451
You're going to the trailer park
for the blue rose.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.702
That's Deputy Cliff's trailer
right there, near the red truck.

24:10.398 --> 24:12.477
That's his truck, too.

24:12.665 --> 24:16.199
- Teresa Banks' trailer is over here.
- Right where we left it.

24:16.229 --> 24:18.172
Where's my goddamn hot water?

24:18.845 --> 24:20.445
See what I mean?

24:21.624 --> 24:22.984
I'll be in my trailer.

24:23.110 --> 24:24.216
Hot water, Carl.

24:24.269 --> 24:26.176
I'm going to get you
some Valium, Margaret.

26:02.285 --> 26:04.731
Gordon, it's 10:10 a.m.

26:04.776 --> 26:07.056
on February 16th.

26:10.939 --> 26:12.099
I was worried about today...

26:12.128 --> 26:14.127
because of the dream
I told you about.

27:12.910 --> 27:14.576
Gordon!

27:15.246 --> 27:16.912
Gordon.

27:20.188 --> 27:21.906
Phillip, is that you?

27:23.999 --> 27:25.290
Philip?

27:25.860 --> 27:29.056
Cooper, meet the long-lost
Phillip Jeffries!

27:29.135 --> 27:31.334
You may have heard of him
from the academy!

27:33.878 --> 27:35.166
Well, now...

27:36.041 --> 27:37.952
I'm not going to talk about Judy.

27:38.011 --> 27:40.620
In fact, we're not going
to talk about Judy at all.

27:40.653 --> 27:42.379
- We're gonna keep her out of it.
- Gordon.

27:42.530 --> 27:43.610
I know, Coop!

27:44.476 --> 27:47.490
Who do you think this is there?

27:47.574 --> 27:49.393
Suffered some bumps
on the old noggin, Phil?

27:49.477 --> 27:51.437
What the hell
did he say there, Albert?

27:51.542 --> 27:53.421
That's Special Agent Dale Cooper!

27:53.868 --> 27:56.483
For God's sakes, Jeffries,
where the hell have you been?

27:56.623 --> 27:58.722
You've been gone
damn near two years!

27:59.140 --> 28:01.410
I sure as hell wanna tell you everything.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.521
- But I haven't got a whole lot to go on.
- Garmonbozia.

28:06.679 --> 28:07.839
This is the...

28:08.470 --> 28:10.163
Formica table.

28:10.203 --> 28:12.019
Oh, believe me I followed.

28:12.052 --> 28:15.706
Green is its colour.

28:17.711 --> 28:19.871
It was a dream.

28:19.963 --> 28:23.603
We live inside a dream.

28:28.629 --> 28:31.119
Fell a victim.

28:32.557 --> 28:37.900
With this ring, I thee wed.

28:40.009 --> 28:40.969
The ring.

28:43.553 --> 28:45.590
It was above
a convenience store.

28:48.553 --> 28:52.632
Electricity.

28:54.244 --> 28:55.938
Listen, and listen carefully.

28:55.947 --> 28:58.786
I've been to one
of their meetings.

29:04.522 --> 29:05.509
Hell, God, baby,

29:05.549 --> 29:08.189
damn, no!
I found something.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.821
And then there they were.

29:28.825 --> 29:30.065
He's gone!

29:30.105 --> 29:32.596
He's gone!
Albert, call the front desk!

29:32.626 --> 29:33.897
I've got the front desk now.

29:33.966 --> 29:35.406
He was never here.

29:35.481 --> 29:36.794
And news from Deer Meadow.

29:36.879 --> 29:39.141
Agent Chester Desmond
has disappeared.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.859
Gordon, what's going on?

29:46.303 --> 29:47.529
He was here.

29:49.272 --> 29:50.951
But where did he go?

29:52.258 --> 29:53.818
And where is Chester Desmond?

29:58.640 --> 30:01.632
That's her trailer over there
and I never touched a goddamn thing.

30:02.099 --> 30:05.298
Agent Chet Desmond
come by a second time...

30:05.434 --> 30:07.878
and asked to see
Deputy Cliff's trailer...

30:07.971 --> 30:10.330
over here, which I showed him.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.219
Then, I went back to my trailer...

30:12.248 --> 30:13.927
and after that,
never saw him again.

30:14.803 --> 30:15.723
Thank you, Carl.

30:16.053 --> 30:18.012
- Sorry to wake you.
- It's all right.

30:19.164 --> 30:20.948
I was having a bad dream, anyway.

30:22.066 --> 30:24.503
That's not the way out
to Deputy Cliff's trailer.

30:24.522 --> 30:25.482
I told you.

30:26.412 --> 30:27.971
I'm not going
to Deputy Cliff's trailer.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.963
Well, where the hell are you going?

30:31.217 --> 30:32.537
I'm going over here.

30:34.634 --> 30:35.895
What's over there?

30:36.808 --> 30:38.848
God damn,
these people are confusing.

30:47.464 --> 30:49.384
What are you looking for?

30:51.003 --> 30:52.727
What was here, Mr. Rodd?

30:54.283 --> 30:56.453
A trailer was here.
What the hell do you think?

30:57.475 --> 30:58.925
Can you tell me
whose trailer it was,

30:59.015 --> 31:00.568
and who stayed in it?

31:02.232 --> 31:04.631
An old woman and her grandson.

31:05.670 --> 31:07.050
Can you tell me
what their names were?

31:09.028 --> 31:10.286
Chalfont.

31:11.462 --> 31:12.787
As a matter of fact...

31:13.461 --> 31:15.119
Chalfont was the name...

31:15.163 --> 31:17.098
of the people that rented
this space before.

31:18.170 --> 31:19.463
Two Chalfonts.

31:20.727 --> 31:22.068
Weird, huh?

31:24.384 --> 31:26.303
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

31:28.934 --> 31:30.082
Yep.

31:30.402 --> 31:31.655
Sure is.

31:48.456 --> 31:50.091
Diane, it's 4:20 p.m.

31:50.965 --> 31:52.272
I'm standing here at Wind River,

31:52.334 --> 31:54.533
near the location where the body
of Teresa Banks was found.

31:55.901 --> 31:58.436
Diane, this case
gives me a strange feeling.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.798
Not only has Special Agent
Chester Desmond disappeared...

32:01.849 --> 32:03.166
without a trace,

32:03.207 --> 32:06.166
but this is one of Cole's
blue rose cases.

32:06.237 --> 32:09.154
The clues found by Special
Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley...

32:09.299 --> 32:10.967
have led to dead ends.

32:11.083 --> 32:14.025
The letter extracted from beneath
the fingernail of Teresa Banks...

32:14.082 --> 32:16.756
gives me the feeling
the killer will strike again.

32:17.356 --> 32:19.277
But like the song goes...

32:19.452 --> 32:21.451
"Who knows where or when?"

32:44.558 --> 32:45.678
Donna!

32:48.193 --> 32:50.251
Just a minute, Laura.

33:13.182 --> 33:15.899
Yeah, Mike, you're the real man.

33:16.110 --> 33:18.550
That's right. Mike is the man.

33:18.923 --> 33:21.688
Mike is the man.

33:23.257 --> 33:24.857
Laura Palmer...

33:25.167 --> 33:27.179
see you later.

33:44.277 --> 33:46.289
See you in a sec.

34:37.751 --> 34:39.036
Hey, baby.

34:44.663 --> 34:45.998
Just kiss me.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.158
It does matter.

34:48.413 --> 34:49.657
We're in love.

34:50.268 --> 34:51.987
James, you don't know what
you're talking about.

34:54.188 --> 34:57.027
Quit trying to hold on so tight.

34:58.153 --> 34:59.433
I'm gone.

34:59.602 --> 35:01.122
Long gone...

35:01.652 --> 35:04.051
like a turkey in the corn.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.095
You're not a turkey.

35:12.868 --> 35:15.909
A turkey's one of
the dumbest birds on earth.

35:30.176 --> 35:32.816
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

35:41.818 --> 35:43.290
Don't ever leave.

35:45.871 --> 35:48.563
Laura, don't ever leave.

35:50.737 --> 35:52.694
I'll never leave you.

36:24.570 --> 36:27.669
Where were you for the last hour?
I've been looking all over for you.

36:28.302 --> 36:29.463
I was standing
right behind you,

36:29.516 --> 36:32.236
but you're too dumb
to turn around.

36:33.574 --> 36:35.789
If he turned around,
he might get dizzy.

36:35.807 --> 36:38.246
Where were you?
I'm not kidding around!

36:38.970 --> 36:40.210
Who were you with?

36:40.685 --> 36:42.884
Get lost, Bobby!

36:43.319 --> 36:44.519
Oh. yeah?

36:45.024 --> 36:47.377
You'll be calling soon,
and maybe I won't be around.

36:53.439 --> 36:55.319
Come on, Bobby.

36:57.652 --> 36:59.140
Come on.

36:59.158 --> 37:00.578
Just a little one?

37:02.738 --> 37:04.134
Come on.

37:09.866 --> 37:11.500
Love you, babe.

37:43.525 --> 37:45.724
Are you going
to see James tonight?

37:48.328 --> 37:51.567
Why are you suddenly so interested
in who I'm going to see at night?

37:54.417 --> 37:56.377
Nighttime is my time.

37:56.503 --> 37:58.168
You're tellin' me.

37:58.736 --> 38:00.656
That's only because you won't
let me in on any of it.

38:03.652 --> 38:06.049
You're not going
to see Bobby, are you?

38:07.830 --> 38:09.389
Maybe.

38:09.649 --> 38:11.290
My God, Laura.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.840
Well, why not?

38:15.599 --> 38:16.977
Because Bobby is a loser.

38:17.014 --> 38:18.811
You said so yourself.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.366
He's a goon.

38:25.150 --> 38:26.629
James is the one.

38:29.820 --> 38:33.099
He loves you
with that everlasting love.

38:33.740 --> 38:35.260
True love.

38:38.876 --> 38:41.275
Yes, James is very sweet.

38:42.629 --> 38:45.519
Why don't you get out
your violin, Donna?

38:45.946 --> 38:47.787
Sweet?

38:48.932 --> 38:51.572
God, he's gorgeous.

38:53.336 --> 38:56.473
Yes, James is very sweet...

38:56.744 --> 38:59.063
and very gorgeous.

39:03.522 --> 39:07.121
I wonder if Mike
could ever write a poem.

39:20.347 --> 39:23.578
Do you think that if you were
falling in space...

39:24.766 --> 39:26.562
that you would
slow down after a while...

39:26.596 --> 39:28.321
or go faster and faster?

39:36.140 --> 39:37.860
Faster and faster.

39:41.090 --> 39:44.089
And for a long time,
you wouldn't feel anything.

39:46.763 --> 39:50.282
And then you'd burst into fire.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.879
Forever.

40:00.018 --> 40:02.737
And the angels
wouldn't help you...

40:07.846 --> 40:10.246
because they've all gone away.

40:28.461 --> 40:29.707
Mom?

42:04.201 --> 42:05.601
My secret diary...

42:05.942 --> 42:07.740
there are pages missing.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.755
Who would do that?

42:10.774 --> 42:11.977
Bob.

42:13.271 --> 42:16.151
But Bob is not real.

42:16.910 --> 42:18.693
There are pages torn out!

42:18.746 --> 42:20.306
That is real, Harold!

42:20.904 --> 42:22.668
Well, maybe...

42:22.870 --> 42:24.110
Maybe...

42:24.537 --> 42:25.596
Okay.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.550
Bob is real!

42:30.474 --> 42:33.594
He's been having me
since I was twelve.

42:35.645 --> 42:36.875
And the diary
was hidden too well.

42:36.910 --> 42:40.668
There is no other person
who could've known where it was.

42:43.358 --> 42:46.277
He comes in through
my window at night.

42:49.359 --> 42:50.879
He's real.

42:51.273 --> 42:53.793
He's getting to know me now.

42:54.058 --> 42:55.578
He speaks to me.

42:57.019 --> 42:59.098
What does Bob say?

43:01.840 --> 43:05.679
He says he wants to be me
or he'll kill me.

43:07.993 --> 43:10.793
- No. No!
- Yes!

43:11.371 --> 43:12.731
Yes!

43:13.413 --> 43:15.721
What? Please, what?

43:16.611 --> 43:18.345
Fire...

43:18.535 --> 43:20.190
walk...

43:20.336 --> 43:22.087
with...

43:22.171 --> 43:23.368
me.

43:23.460 --> 43:24.690
Me!

43:34.895 --> 43:36.246
The trees.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.212
The trees.

43:39.078 --> 43:41.541
You have to hide
the diary, Harold.

43:42.033 --> 43:44.512
You made me write it all down.

43:45.421 --> 43:47.301
He doesn't know about you.

43:47.491 --> 43:49.090
You'll be safe.

43:52.852 --> 43:54.052
I'm sorry.

44:21.123 --> 44:23.127
What? Laura.

44:33.091 --> 44:35.011
I don't know
when I can come back.

44:36.776 --> 44:37.936
Maybe never.

44:53.788 --> 44:56.614
I want to taste...

44:56.752 --> 44:59.192
through your mouth.

45:01.913 --> 45:03.422
No.

45:09.791 --> 45:11.349
Lately I've been filled
with the knowledge...

45:11.375 --> 45:12.958
that the killer will strike again.

45:13.106 --> 45:14.728
But because it's just a feeling,

45:14.757 --> 45:16.477
I am powerless to stop it.

45:17.354 --> 45:18.993
One more thing, Albert.

45:19.363 --> 45:21.043
When the next murder happens,

45:21.469 --> 45:23.188
you will help me solve it.

45:24.752 --> 45:26.329
Let's test it for the record.

45:28.298 --> 45:30.390
Will the next victim
be a man or a woman?

45:31.458 --> 45:32.378
A woman.

45:33.741 --> 45:34.972
All right.

45:36.897 --> 45:39.417
What color hair will she have?

45:41.056 --> 45:42.536
Blond.

45:42.737 --> 45:45.216
Tell me some other
things about her.

45:45.535 --> 45:47.095
She's in high school.

45:47.806 --> 45:49.366
She is sexually active.

45:50.975 --> 45:52.375
She's using drugs.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.110
She's crying out for help.

45:58.563 --> 45:59.987
Damn, Cooper,
that really narrows it down.

46:00.006 --> 46:02.206
You're talking
half the girls in America!

46:04.283 --> 46:05.866
What's she doing right now?

46:07.531 --> 46:10.411
She's preparing
a great abundance of food.

46:19.369 --> 46:21.702
Okay, here's your change.
Thank you.

46:22.108 --> 46:23.669
Heidi's got a bloody nose.

46:24.107 --> 46:25.259
A bloody nose?

46:25.299 --> 46:27.019
Think you could give Laura
a hand with Meals on Wheels?

46:28.034 --> 46:29.787
I was just... I was busy...

46:29.826 --> 46:31.305
I was doing this.

46:33.110 --> 46:35.309
You're not that busy.

47:15.574 --> 47:17.854
This would look nice
on your wall.

47:21.946 --> 47:23.646
The man behind the mask...

47:23.735 --> 47:26.895
is looking for the book
with the pages torn out.

47:26.935 --> 47:28.934
He is going toward the hiding place.

47:32.262 --> 47:34.462
He is under the fan now.

47:37.788 --> 47:39.515
- Shelly?
- Yeah?

47:41.979 --> 47:43.962
I can't do the
Meals on Wheels today.

47:45.072 --> 47:47.152
I just... I just can't!

47:47.433 --> 47:48.568
What?

49:42.405 --> 49:44.973
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

49:47.334 --> 49:50.848
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49:52.463 --> 49:55.816
No, no, no.

49:59.256 --> 50:00.656
No, it's not him.

50:00.723 --> 50:02.578
No! No, it's not him!
It's not!

50:02.612 --> 50:05.638
It's not him!
It's not him! No.

50:13.409 --> 50:16.539
Donna, are you...
are you my...

50:17.008 --> 50:19.048
are you my best friend?

50:19.239 --> 50:20.481
Of course!

50:21.225 --> 50:23.763
What is it, Laura?
What's wrong?

50:34.625 --> 50:37.265
I'm your friend always.

50:41.596 --> 50:42.875
Come on.

51:13.438 --> 51:14.700
Hi, honey.

51:16.317 --> 51:17.407
How's Donna?

51:18.237 --> 51:19.286
Fine.

51:20.156 --> 51:21.322
And school?

51:22.076 --> 51:23.549
School's fine.

51:23.655 --> 51:24.863
Sit down.

51:35.076 --> 51:36.380
Sit down.

51:43.182 --> 51:44.782
Are you hungry?

51:45.463 --> 51:46.733
Not really.

51:55.952 --> 51:58.873
You didn't wash your hands before
you sat down to dinner, did you?

52:06.128 --> 52:07.227
Let me see.

52:08.441 --> 52:09.671
Dad.

52:12.643 --> 52:15.763
These hands are filthy.

52:16.988 --> 52:18.149
Look.

52:19.552 --> 52:22.831
There's dirt way
under this fingernail.

52:27.568 --> 52:29.888
- Leland, what are you doing?
- Look at this finger, here.

52:29.971 --> 52:32.490
Laura did not wash
her hands before dinner.

52:33.045 --> 52:35.265
- Look at this.
- Don't.

52:38.937 --> 52:40.817
Is it from a lover?

52:43.428 --> 52:45.154
Did you get this
from your lover?

52:46.046 --> 52:48.686
They don't call them lovers
in high school, Leland.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.086
Bobby didn't give you this.

52:51.649 --> 52:54.236
How do you know Bobby
didn't give her that?

52:54.579 --> 52:56.403
Did Bobby give you this,

52:56.570 --> 52:58.050
or is there someone new?

52:59.574 --> 53:02.576
Leland! Please leave her alone.
Don't do that.

53:02.632 --> 53:04.071
She doesn't like that.

53:04.654 --> 53:06.152
How do you know what she likes?

53:06.886 --> 53:08.617
Stop it!

53:11.265 --> 53:12.859
Stop that!

53:30.370 --> 53:31.968
Now, you sit down...

53:32.836 --> 53:34.836
and we'll all have dinner.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.134
I'll sit down...

53:37.983 --> 53:39.864
but not a one of us
is going to start eating...

53:40.077 --> 53:42.654
until Laura washes her hands!

53:44.928 --> 53:46.808
Wash your hands!

55:04.547 --> 55:06.088
What is it, Leland?

55:10.614 --> 55:11.855
Laura, honey?

55:25.824 --> 55:27.664
I love you.

55:30.842 --> 55:32.532
I love you so much.

55:34.450 --> 55:35.625
Dad.

55:48.756 --> 55:50.156
Good night, princess.

56:25.921 --> 56:27.490
Is it true?

58:38.272 --> 58:42.353
Do you know who I am?

58:46.632 --> 58:49.231
I am the arm.

58:51.551 --> 58:52.751
And I...

58:53.629 --> 58:56.582
...sound like this.

59:25.983 --> 59:28.146
Don't take the ring, Laura.

59:29.537 --> 59:31.537
Don't take the ring.

01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:03.711
My name is Annie.

01:00:04.576 --> 01:00:06.650
I've been with Dale and Laura.

01:00:07.424 --> 01:00:10.703
The good Dale is in the lodge,
and he can't leave.

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:13.488
Write it in your diary.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.159
This is where we live, Shelly!

01:02:16.359 --> 01:02:18.519
As if I didn't know.

01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:21.787
I'm gonna show you how to wash this tile.
Then you're gonna do it.

01:02:21.978 --> 01:02:23.988
Come off it, Leo.
I have to get ready for work.

01:02:24.222 --> 01:02:25.718
What did you say?

01:02:26.353 --> 01:02:29.232
Shelly, I'm not fooling
around anymore!

01:02:29.658 --> 01:02:31.925
First thing you'll learn
is a good attitude!

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.344
That's the key!

01:02:33.622 --> 01:02:35.055
Anybody'll tell you that.

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.611
Don't even think
about going anywhere!

01:02:40.639 --> 01:02:41.939
I'm not finished with you!

01:02:45.539 --> 01:02:47.046
Leo, Bobby.

01:02:47.696 --> 01:02:49.616
What are you doing
calling me here?

01:02:49.822 --> 01:02:51.354
I'm sorry.

01:02:52.585 --> 01:02:53.725
The football's empty.

01:02:53.849 --> 01:02:55.303
I'm looking for Santa Claus.

01:02:55.357 --> 01:02:57.876
No way.
You already owe me money.

01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.850
Five thousand, to be exact.

01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:06.200
Leo Johnson, are you telling me
there's no Santa Claus?

01:03:11.934 --> 01:03:13.614
Yeah, Roadhouse.

01:03:13.913 --> 01:03:15.838
Jacques, Bobby.

01:03:17.156 --> 01:03:18.719
I need some things, man.

01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:23.729
How come you only call me
when you're desperate?

01:03:24.085 --> 01:03:26.290
You desperate, baby?

01:03:26.412 --> 01:03:28.218
Are you interested or not?

01:03:28.342 --> 01:03:30.748
Yeah, maybe, Bobby, baby.

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.094
Maybe.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:37.403
For ten K, I have a friend
who has what you want.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.103
His stuff is the best.

01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:42.325
Hit me.

01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:47.191
Two days, midnight.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.750
By the sound of sawing wood.

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:55.391
Jacques, you crazy
fucking Canadian.

01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:57.466
This sounds big.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.007
Where you going?

01:04:41.054 --> 01:04:42.653
Nowhere fast...

01:04:44.154 --> 01:04:45.594
and you're not coming.

01:04:48.068 --> 01:04:49.748
Laura, come on.

01:04:50.065 --> 01:04:52.424
Remember me?
I'm your best friend.

01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:09.009
Aren't you going
to fix me a drink?

01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:18.697
Where are the cookies?

01:05:20.872 --> 01:05:22.631
You mean Fred and Ginger?

01:05:23.477 --> 01:05:25.116
Dancing.

01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:30.950
If I had a nickel for every
cigarette your mom smoked,

01:05:31.186 --> 01:05:32.789
I'd be dead.

01:05:40.592 --> 01:05:42.401
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:06:21.137 --> 01:06:23.496
When this kind of fire starts...

01:06:24.008 --> 01:06:27.011
it is very hard to put out.

01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:31.673
The tender boughs
of innocence burn first.

01:06:31.938 --> 01:06:34.208
And the wind rises...

01:06:34.656 --> 01:06:35.838
and then...

01:06:36.895 --> 01:06:39.134
all goodness is in jeopardy.

01:10:05.678 --> 01:10:08.357
So you want to fuck
the homecoming queen.

01:10:09.994 --> 01:10:11.415
Let's go around the world, babe.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.219
This isn't going to get you
in Walla Walla.

01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:21.348
You go all the way,

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:23.112
don't you, little girl?

01:10:26.109 --> 01:10:27.349
Sooner or later.

01:10:31.179 --> 01:10:33.578
You willing to go all the way, huh?

01:10:34.118 --> 01:10:35.772
You gonna do it to me?

01:10:47.878 --> 01:10:49.117
Let's boogie.

01:10:50.144 --> 01:10:52.131
What the hell are you doing?

01:10:53.647 --> 01:10:55.148
You part of the deal?

01:10:55.212 --> 01:10:56.732
No, she isn't!

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:42.654
What did you say your name was?

01:11:44.113 --> 01:11:45.574
Buck.

01:11:47.128 --> 01:11:48.887
That was really nice, Buck.

01:12:14.226 --> 01:12:15.677
Okay, Donna.

01:12:16.892 --> 01:12:18.015
Let's go.

01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:40.330
Welcome to Canada.

01:12:49.461 --> 01:12:52.459
Don't expect a turkey dog here.

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.352
Hey, slow pokes.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:03.695
- Guess what?
- What?

01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:06.951
There's no tomorrow.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.519
Know why, baby?

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:14.797
'Cause it never get here.

01:13:23.586 --> 01:13:25.152
Hey, Jacques...

01:13:25.374 --> 01:13:26.773
I'm not Jacques.

01:13:30.723 --> 01:13:32.643
I am the Great Went.

01:13:37.666 --> 01:13:39.665
I am the Muffin.

01:13:42.566 --> 01:13:44.885
And what a muffin you've got, eh?

01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:05.737
I am as blank as a fart.

01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:53.294
Chug-a-lug, Donna.

01:14:55.952 --> 01:14:57.173
Yeah.

01:17:00.004 --> 01:17:04.442
I haven't seen you since I was
thrown out of the One Eyed Jack's.

01:17:05.782 --> 01:17:08.100
What else did we do together?

01:17:12.338 --> 01:17:13.857
I remember.

01:17:38.975 --> 01:17:42.579
Hey, the party twins!

01:17:42.769 --> 01:17:45.157
My high school sandwich.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:47.333
Let's put some meat inside.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:51.908
She's been dead a year.

01:17:51.937 --> 01:17:52.977
Yeah? Who?

01:17:53.761 --> 01:17:54.801
Teresa.

01:17:55.649 --> 01:17:57.014
Teresa Banks.

01:17:58.283 --> 01:18:00.482
Yeah, a whole year.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:06.270
She was gonna get rich.

01:18:08.024 --> 01:18:10.143
She was blackmailing somebody.

01:18:14.373 --> 01:18:15.508
Right.

01:18:16.424 --> 01:18:17.664
She called me.

01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:23.376
She even asked me what
your fathers looked like.

01:18:23.419 --> 01:18:24.659
What?

01:18:24.943 --> 01:18:26.782
She asked about my father?

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.516
Hey...

01:18:30.545 --> 01:18:34.143
Why don't you two come up
to the cabin this week?

01:18:43.555 --> 01:18:44.834
Thursday.

01:19:12.092 --> 01:19:13.611
Here we go again.

01:19:14.718 --> 01:19:16.757
Like we're back at One Eyed Jack's.

01:19:18.174 --> 01:19:21.293
God, it sure is.

01:19:26.539 --> 01:19:28.059
Oh, shit!

01:19:29.057 --> 01:19:30.776
Is that Donna Hayward?

01:19:41.003 --> 01:19:42.722
No!

01:19:42.848 --> 01:19:46.408
Donna! Donna!

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:50.948
Get her out of here!
Get her out of here, Jacques!

01:19:57.646 --> 01:20:00.738
Tommy!

01:20:02.441 --> 01:20:06.003
Don't you ever wear my stuff!
Don't ever wear my stuff! Ever!

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.764
I'm sorry. I won't wear your stuff.

01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:10.129
Jacques, help me get her home now!

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:11.838
Tommy!

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:14.894
Why can't I wear your stuff?

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.479
Donna, not you!

01:21:07.207 --> 01:21:10.046
How did I get in my house?

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:13.238
How did I get in my bed?

01:21:14.324 --> 01:21:17.523
Life is full of mysteries, Donna.

01:21:19.418 --> 01:21:22.250
Are you mad at me for
wearing something of yours?

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:27.897
I don't want you
to wear my stuff.

01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:35.140
I do love you, Laura.

01:21:43.204 --> 01:21:44.643
I love you, Donna.

01:21:50.443 --> 01:21:52.602
But I don't want you
to be like me.

01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:01.201
Why do you do it?

01:22:23.713 --> 01:22:25.233
Excuse me, honey.

01:22:27.566 --> 01:22:29.726
We're late to meet Mom
for breakfast.

01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:31.409
I'll catch you later.

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:38.153
Bye-bye, Donna.

01:22:38.485 --> 01:22:39.804
Good-bye.

01:23:12.759 --> 01:23:15.350
Dad, is the engine on fire?

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:17.619
It smells like
something's burning.

01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:38.131
Something is burning!

01:23:38.869 --> 01:23:40.005
It's the engine!

01:23:40.037 --> 01:23:42.636
You stole the corn!

01:23:43.255 --> 01:23:45.720
I had it canned...

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.248
over the store!

01:23:48.004 --> 01:23:48.924
And, miss...

01:23:49.297 --> 01:23:54.250
the look on her face
when it was opened!

01:23:54.305 --> 01:23:56.396
There was a stillness!

01:23:57.788 --> 01:24:00.531
Like the Formica tabletop!

01:24:01.665 --> 01:24:04.828
The thread will be torn,
Mr. Palmer!

01:24:05.285 --> 01:24:06.335
Come on!

01:24:06.471 --> 01:24:09.070
The thread will be torn!

01:24:11.744 --> 01:24:13.133
It's him!

01:24:13.508 --> 01:24:15.686
It's your father!

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:17.721
Stop it!

01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:23.389
What was that all about?

01:24:30.706 --> 01:24:32.627
Mister! You shouldn't
do that to your engine.

01:24:32.753 --> 01:24:34.472
You ought to take it easy, mister.

01:24:34.618 --> 01:24:37.241
You're going to burn
your engine out.

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:39.385
What the hell
was all that about?

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:41.502
Why doesn't somebody
do something about this?

01:24:41.747 --> 01:24:43.626
A man comes out
of the blue like that,

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:45.525
starts screaming at you
like a crazy person...

01:24:45.554 --> 01:24:47.353
and harassing my daughter.

01:24:47.653 --> 01:24:48.426
You all right, honey?

01:24:48.448 --> 01:24:50.567
Dad, are you all right?

01:25:00.181 --> 01:25:01.760
Teresa Banks.

01:25:02.184 --> 01:25:04.403
You look just like my Laura.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:09.190
So when's the next
business trip, big boy?

01:25:09.815 --> 01:25:12.352
Soon. And next time...

01:25:12.683 --> 01:25:15.231
let's party with those
girlfriends you told me about.

01:25:18.399 --> 01:25:20.996
Sure. I can arrange that.

01:25:29.551 --> 01:25:31.111
What are you doing?

01:25:32.236 --> 01:25:33.475
Who am I?

01:25:35.834 --> 01:25:37.873
I don't know.

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:39.485
That's right.

01:25:39.599 --> 01:25:40.708
Dad.

01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:43.398
Dad!

01:25:45.074 --> 01:25:47.473
Who... was that?

01:25:48.597 --> 01:25:51.070
He looked... familiar!

01:25:51.123 --> 01:25:52.227
Have I met him?

01:25:52.535 --> 01:25:54.471
No, honey, you haven't met him.
Have you met him?

01:25:54.565 --> 01:25:55.965
No!

01:25:57.368 --> 01:25:58.287
Let's go get your mother.

01:25:58.413 --> 01:26:01.492
No. Just sit here for a moment.

01:26:03.205 --> 01:26:04.205
Oh, my God.

01:26:07.259 --> 01:26:09.408
A man comes out of
the blue like that.

01:26:09.482 --> 01:26:10.922
What's the world coming to?

01:26:34.467 --> 01:26:35.724
- Hey, handsome.
- Hi.

01:26:38.362 --> 01:26:40.201
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:26:40.887 --> 01:26:42.806
I chickened out.

01:27:17.521 --> 01:27:19.521
Sure you're okay?

01:27:20.238 --> 01:27:21.917
Yes.

01:27:35.467 --> 01:27:36.546
Dad?

01:27:37.215 --> 01:27:38.654
Yes.

01:27:41.192 --> 01:27:43.431
Did you come home
during the day last week?

01:27:48.542 --> 01:27:49.661
No.

01:27:52.113 --> 01:27:53.349
Leave us alone!

01:27:53.423 --> 01:27:55.622
God damn it,
get back to your work!

01:28:10.891 --> 01:28:13.850
I thought I saw you.

01:28:17.454 --> 01:28:19.413
Oh, God. You know?

01:28:20.970 --> 01:28:24.529
I did stop home on Friday,
come to think of it.

01:28:25.246 --> 01:28:26.526
I had this severe headache

01:28:27.124 --> 01:28:28.924
and was in the neighborhood, so I...

01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:31.091
darted into the house
to get some aspirin.

01:28:33.758 --> 01:28:35.198
Where were you, Laura?

01:28:35.614 --> 01:28:36.973
I didn't see you.

01:28:43.723 --> 01:28:45.962
I was just down the street.

01:29:28.722 --> 01:29:30.961
The same ring.

01:29:43.631 --> 01:29:45.271
Who are you?

01:29:46.529 --> 01:29:48.249
Who are you really?

01:30:54.145 --> 01:30:56.065
I'm nearly out.

01:30:56.183 --> 01:30:57.695
It's taken care of, babe.

01:30:57.825 --> 01:31:00.464
You and I will make
a big score tonight.

01:31:00.551 --> 01:31:01.806
What is that?

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.039
This should tide you over.

01:31:07.792 --> 01:31:08.871
Thanks.

01:31:10.034 --> 01:31:11.784
A big score?

01:31:12.241 --> 01:31:14.094
Maybe our biggest.

01:31:14.522 --> 01:31:15.601
Don't tell Mike.

01:31:16.165 --> 01:31:18.950
This is just between you and me.

01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.979
Tonight,

01:31:20.022 --> 01:31:22.809
meet me two doors down
from your place at 11:00.

01:31:25.622 --> 01:31:27.359
Midnight...

01:31:27.475 --> 01:31:29.874
near the sound of sawing wood.

01:31:39.586 --> 01:31:40.985
Do you love me, Laura?

01:31:42.013 --> 01:31:43.412
- Bobby?
- What?

01:31:43.628 --> 01:31:44.826
Watch.

01:31:45.327 --> 01:31:46.441
Watch.

01:31:49.524 --> 01:31:50.662
Oh, that's good, Laura.

01:31:50.793 --> 01:31:53.192
That's really good.
You're a great dancer.

01:32:22.786 --> 01:32:24.545
Come on, knock it off.

01:32:25.436 --> 01:32:27.675
Knock it the fuck off.

01:32:34.069 --> 01:32:34.852
Give me the fucking...

01:32:34.855 --> 01:32:36.455
Okay, Okay.

01:33:00.648 --> 01:33:03.129
Bebby? I mean, Bobby?

01:33:05.143 --> 01:33:07.126
I found a little pine cone.

01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:10.190
Shut up.

01:33:11.537 --> 01:33:15.352
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Bobby, I found some dirt!

01:33:16.130 --> 01:33:17.103
Shut up.

01:33:18.351 --> 01:33:19.526
I found some dirt!

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.745
Here he comes.

01:33:31.868 --> 01:33:32.988
Come on.

01:33:40.744 --> 01:33:42.338
Who sent you?

01:33:42.381 --> 01:33:43.340
Jacques.

01:33:44.899 --> 01:33:46.009
That's right.

01:33:56.045 --> 01:33:57.601
Like that, little girl?

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.292
Oh, my God!

01:34:16.619 --> 01:34:17.538
Oh, my God!

01:34:17.951 --> 01:34:20.510
Bobby, what did you do?

01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:23.220
I shot him. Oh, my God!

01:34:24.747 --> 01:34:26.029
I shot him.

01:34:26.166 --> 01:34:27.126
Fuck!

01:34:36.131 --> 01:34:37.691
Get over here and help me!

01:34:39.577 --> 01:34:40.810
Come here!

01:34:45.802 --> 01:34:46.922
Fuck.

01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:05.137
Shut the fuck up!

01:35:05.186 --> 01:35:06.825
This isn't funny, Laura.

01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:08.769
This is not fucking funny.

01:35:09.108 --> 01:35:11.147
Now help me bury him.

01:35:17.004 --> 01:35:18.123
Shit.

01:35:19.588 --> 01:35:23.147
- Bobby, you killed Mike.
- This isn't fucking Mike!

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:32.673
Is this Mike?

01:35:43.698 --> 01:35:45.457
Bobby, do you realize
what you did?

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.169
- You killed Mike.
- Shut up.

01:36:13.517 --> 01:36:17.152
- Bobby, you killed... Mike.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:36:17.806 --> 01:36:18.824
Shut the...

01:36:19.386 --> 01:36:21.625
Come on.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:36:22.415 --> 01:36:23.374
Come on!

01:36:29.890 --> 01:36:32.482
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:36:32.493 --> 01:36:34.060
- Come on!
- Look at that!

01:36:36.075 --> 01:36:38.411
Come on!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:36:38.428 --> 01:36:39.347
Come on!

01:37:19.283 --> 01:37:20.495
Where were you last night?

01:37:21.403 --> 01:37:24.123
I thought we were supposed
to get together.

01:37:29.424 --> 01:37:30.704
You're on something again, huh?

01:37:37.563 --> 01:37:39.202
So when will I get to see you?

01:37:47.655 --> 01:37:49.335
I got to go.

01:41:24.392 --> 01:41:26.453
Who are you?

01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:28.315
Who are you?

01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:30.189
Who are you?

01:41:33.411 --> 01:41:35.810
Who are you?

01:42:09.829 --> 01:42:11.317
Laura? Honey?

01:42:16.281 --> 01:42:18.346
I really would like
to talk to you.

01:42:21.264 --> 01:42:23.583
Laura, sweetheart.

01:42:53.543 --> 01:42:54.805
Laura, honey?

01:42:56.081 --> 01:42:57.214
Sweetheart?

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:01.506
Laura, is something wrong
this morning?

01:43:05.328 --> 01:43:07.727
Stay away from me.

01:44:32.281 --> 01:44:33.601
Not tonight.

01:44:37.192 --> 01:44:38.912
Just give me some stuff...

01:44:38.973 --> 01:44:41.412
to hold me over until tomorrow.

01:44:43.049 --> 01:44:44.808
Why?

01:44:44.956 --> 01:44:46.955
Why not? Where you going?

01:44:51.559 --> 01:44:53.125
Where are you going?

01:44:56.428 --> 01:44:59.368
I'm going home, Bobby.

01:45:05.028 --> 01:45:06.787
You don't want me.

01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:10.389
You just want the blow,
don't you?

01:45:13.157 --> 01:45:15.141
It's okay.

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:17.891
It's okay.

01:45:18.090 --> 01:45:19.870
Bobby's got it.

01:45:20.486 --> 01:45:22.408
Bobby's got it.

01:45:29.582 --> 01:45:31.022
Good night.

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:34.329
Good night, sweetheart.

01:46:21.993 --> 01:46:24.072
I do love you, but...

01:46:33.065 --> 01:46:37.223
I'll meet you in fifteen...

01:46:38.236 --> 01:46:40.955
I'll meet you
in fifteen minutes.

01:46:57.142 --> 01:47:00.140
God, why did I say that?

01:47:00.894 --> 01:47:03.133
Fifteen minutes?

01:48:41.004 --> 01:48:43.043
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:48:43.372 --> 01:48:45.261
That's right.

01:48:45.679 --> 01:48:49.117
There's no place left to go,
is there, James?

01:48:51.389 --> 01:48:53.680
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

01:48:53.916 --> 01:48:56.791
You know it, and I know it.

01:48:57.852 --> 01:48:59.931
What's wrong with us?

01:49:01.811 --> 01:49:04.570
We have everything.

01:49:04.752 --> 01:49:07.791
Everything but everything.

01:49:23.064 --> 01:49:26.063
You always hurt
the ones you love.

01:49:26.179 --> 01:49:28.538
You mean the ones you pity.

01:49:28.878 --> 01:49:31.117
Say whatever you want.

01:49:33.718 --> 01:49:36.077
I know you love me.

01:49:38.133 --> 01:49:40.012
And I love you.

01:49:53.434 --> 01:49:56.033
I do love you, James.

01:49:57.952 --> 01:50:00.191
Let's get lost together.

01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.451
Shit.

01:50:16.394 --> 01:50:17.433
What?

01:50:19.644 --> 01:50:21.963
He might try to kill you.

01:50:28.513 --> 01:50:29.753
What's wrong?

01:50:31.873 --> 01:50:33.591
What?

01:50:33.726 --> 01:50:36.685
If he finds out...

01:50:38.228 --> 01:50:40.187
Laura, what's the matter?

01:50:45.688 --> 01:50:48.047
Bobby killed a guy.

01:50:49.335 --> 01:50:51.016
What are you talking about?

01:50:51.164 --> 01:50:53.083
Bobby didn't kill anybody.

01:50:55.006 --> 01:50:57.285
Do you want to see?

01:50:57.733 --> 01:50:59.772
See what?

01:51:01.889 --> 01:51:03.168
Right.

01:51:06.467 --> 01:51:09.266
Open your eyes, James.

01:51:16.099 --> 01:51:18.898
You don't even know me.

01:51:19.432 --> 01:51:23.608
There are things about me...

01:51:23.779 --> 01:51:26.659
Even Donna doesn't know me.

01:51:43.344 --> 01:51:46.383
Your Laura disappeared.

01:52:01.651 --> 01:52:04.050
It's just me now.

01:52:19.067 --> 01:52:21.546
What about this, James?

01:52:39.525 --> 01:52:42.004
I think you want
to take me home now.

01:52:56.304 --> 01:52:57.717
Don't!

01:52:57.793 --> 01:52:59.449
Come on!

01:53:00.104 --> 01:53:03.463
Don't! Just don't!

01:53:07.949 --> 01:53:10.788
I love you, James!

01:53:45.029 --> 01:53:47.309
You're right on time, baby.

01:54:59.383 --> 01:55:00.662
Don't.

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.639
Jacques! Don't!

01:55:06.447 --> 01:55:08.493
Don't tie me up tonight,
God damn it!

01:55:08.503 --> 01:55:10.169
- Don't! Stop it!
- Get back here!

01:55:10.187 --> 01:55:12.592
Don't! Don't!

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:13.456
Laura!

01:55:13.471 --> 01:55:14.664
Please!

01:55:14.806 --> 01:55:16.707
Don't tie me up, Jacques!

01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:53.972
Leo, will you untie me?

01:56:10.261 --> 01:56:13.298
Leo, will you please untie me?

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.639
Shut up!

01:56:31.982 --> 01:56:35.761
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

01:56:58.145 --> 01:57:00.536
Bob?

01:57:01.776 --> 01:57:03.137
Bob?

01:57:35.290 --> 01:57:37.569
Are you going to kill me?

01:57:40.792 --> 01:57:42.592
Father...

01:57:44.276 --> 01:57:46.195
If I die now...

01:57:46.343 --> 01:57:50.093
will you come and see me?

01:57:57.113 --> 01:57:58.673
Your diary.

01:58:00.749 --> 01:58:03.678
I always thought
you knew it was me!

01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:06.832
Don't look at me!

01:58:09.717 --> 01:58:14.207
I never knew you knew it was me.

01:58:14.354 --> 01:58:16.282
I want you.

01:58:16.473 --> 01:58:18.712
I'm so dirty.

01:58:19.809 --> 01:58:21.728
I'm not ready.

01:58:24.314 --> 01:58:25.913
I'm sorry.

01:58:27.953 --> 01:58:30.830
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.091
Let me in!

01:59:29.901 --> 01:59:32.100
No!

01:59:34.272 --> 01:59:36.277
Don't make me do this!

01:59:36.368 --> 01:59:38.568
No!

02:02:09.323 --> 02:02:10.881
Bob...

02:02:10.967 --> 02:02:16.100
I want all my...

02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:20.203
garmonbozia.
