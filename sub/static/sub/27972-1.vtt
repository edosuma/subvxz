♪ ♪

01:08.503 --> 01:10.940
Oh, hello.

01:10.983 --> 01:14.639
It is a beautiful day to sell
books, isn't it, Eliot?

01:14.683 --> 01:16.337
Yes, I agree.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.128
Hey, Alex. What's up?

01:25.172 --> 01:26.608
Oh hey, Jamie.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.436
I was trying to figure out
a good book to give Taylor

01:28.479 --> 01:30.438
for Valentine's Day.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.309
She likes romantic comedies,
I figure...

01:32.353 --> 01:33.832
[laughs]

01:33.876 --> 01:35.573
Mirth is funny, right?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.227
Yes, it is.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.707
Um... and Edith Wharton,

01:38.750 --> 01:40.491
one of the greatest authors
of all time.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.276
The first woman to win a
Pulitzer for literature.

01:42.319 --> 01:45.540
But in this case Mirth
is ironic.

01:45.583 --> 01:46.715
Oh.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.460
Also romantic, but much funnier,

01:52.503 --> 01:54.549
and spoiler alert,
a happy ending.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.290
Although, if you want her crying
on your shoulder

01:56.333 --> 01:57.900
about the importance
of following your heart

01:57.943 --> 02:02.600
when it comes to true love
then "House of Mirth" it is.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.602
Happy deciding.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.169
You are a lifesaver.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.779
Well, I hope she likes them.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.172
Alright, thank you, Jamie.

02:09.216 --> 02:09.999
Of course. Bye.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.087
Bye.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.351
Hey, Luce.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.310
Did you know Lennox Music
is closed?

02:16.353 --> 02:17.354
What? When?

02:17.398 --> 02:18.268
I don't know.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.487
I just saw the place is empty

02:19.530 --> 02:20.618
and there's a "closed
for business" sign

02:20.662 --> 02:21.837
on the front door.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.491
That is the third business
on this block

02:23.534 --> 02:25.362
since the beginning of the year.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.886
Fourth, if you count Cassidy's
Candles in December.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.758
What is going on?

02:39.681 --> 02:41.552
What?

02:54.522 --> 02:56.393
There's my favourite niece.

02:56.437 --> 02:59.788
Your parents Skyped me
last night from Winnipeg.

02:59.831 --> 03:02.704
I swear, they're gonna put
100,000 miles on that RV

03:02.747 --> 03:06.142
by the end of the year if they-
what is it?

03:10.842 --> 03:12.322
When did you get this?

03:12.366 --> 03:13.541
This morning.

03:13.584 --> 03:14.933
And I checked.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.240
Every shop in the business
district got one, too.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.460
I bet if you check your mail
you have one.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.907
What do you think this means?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.604
I guess we'll find out
at the meeting.

03:33.648 --> 03:38.261
But if this Ridley is a property
development company?

03:38.305 --> 03:41.264
No, that can't be good news
for any of us.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.795
So, as you can see, we turn
the Waterford business district

03:50.839 --> 03:53.885
into a mixed use space
which will drive revenue

03:53.929 --> 03:56.366
for the entire town.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.281
I like the adjustments.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.240
I think the Waterford
council will, too.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.763
Thank you.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.460
Sawyer, how many projects
have you done for Ridley?

04:03.504 --> 04:05.027
Five?

04:05.070 --> 04:06.463
Uh, if you pick this one, seven.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.683
Seven. Impressive.

04:08.726 --> 04:11.729
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

04:11.773 --> 04:15.255
The Waterford project
isn't secure yet.

04:15.298 --> 04:19.084
It will be, which is where
you come in.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.999
Me?

04:21.043 --> 04:22.566
You're from Waterford.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.829
A point you made in
your initial presentation.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.440
I am.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.745
That's gonna help us
when it comes

04:27.789 --> 04:29.269
to persuading the community.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.662
Hold on, Dana, I haven't
been back in a very long time

04:31.706 --> 04:33.664
and besides I'm just
the architect.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.187
But you could be more.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.798
Here's your opportunity.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.887
The Waterford council wants us
to present our designs

04:38.930 --> 04:42.151
in a couple of days before they
take an initial vote next week.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.588
We have secured several
properties already

04:44.632 --> 04:46.111
but their sales are contingent

04:46.155 --> 04:48.505
on this project going
to the next step.

04:48.549 --> 04:51.334
Help Ridley take that next step

04:51.378 --> 04:53.162
and we can talk about
bringing you in-house

04:53.205 --> 04:56.165
on a permanent basis.

04:56.208 --> 04:59.168
So no more per project bids?

04:59.211 --> 05:01.388
How does that sound to you?

05:01.431 --> 05:05.130
That sounds great.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.002
Good.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.530
Maybe it won't be that bad?

05:13.574 --> 05:16.707
The flyer only says they're
discussing a project.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.014
This happened a few years ago
in Tanner Falls.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.494
Some developers came in,

05:20.537 --> 05:22.409
said they were gonna do
some improvements,

05:22.452 --> 05:24.280
wiped out all of the stores
in the business district

05:24.324 --> 05:26.108
and then they built them back up
to look like something

05:26.151 --> 05:27.457
out of an H.G. Wells novel.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.111
And not one of the cool ones.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.374
Well, if they do go forward
with something like that

05:31.418 --> 05:34.246
they at least have to buy
you out.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.597
But I'd still lose the store.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.034
And I've dreamed of owning
this place since I worked here

05:39.077 --> 05:40.688
in high school.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.603
It's the reason that I fell in
love with reading and writing

05:42.646 --> 05:43.995
and storytelling.

05:44.039 --> 05:48.086
I don't want another store,
I want True Love.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.523
Come on.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.395
I know something that's gonna
make you feel better.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.614
[grumbles]

06:01.752 --> 06:03.275
Is that Jason Barnaby?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.842
Uh-huh.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.322
He met Lisa in the travel
section last year.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.584
I think he's gonna propose.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.804
I think you're right.

06:13.068 --> 06:13.938
What're we looking at?

06:13.982 --> 06:14.939
[gasps]

06:14.983 --> 06:15.853
Rick!

06:15.897 --> 06:16.854
What?

06:16.898 --> 06:17.986
Shh!

06:18.029 --> 06:19.291
There's a proposal.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.561
Yes.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.302
[together]
Awwww.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.696
How many proposals
does that make?

06:32.740 --> 06:34.568
Four since I bought this place.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.744
This shop really is a lucky
charm for love.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.180
Ooh, I'm gonna use that.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.269
Oh, which brings me to...

06:40.312 --> 06:42.576
Recipe for love?

06:42.619 --> 06:44.795
Not all of us are in
a romantic time out.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.406
Hiatus.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.321
My boss, the incurable romantic
who owns a romance bookstore

06:49.365 --> 06:51.628
while actively avoiding romance.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.108
Do you see the irony here?

06:53.151 --> 06:54.414
[laughs]

06:54.457 --> 06:55.632
Is this for couples only?

06:55.676 --> 06:56.981
Oh, no, no, no.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.330
All sorts of singles
will be there,

06:58.374 --> 06:59.897
including yours truly.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.551
Yeah, but you're teaching,
so you don't count.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.031
He counts.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.336
Ooh.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.470
Thanks.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.863
Cooking class?

07:08.906 --> 07:10.995
Just ask her out directly.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.562
Well, what if she says no?

07:12.606 --> 07:13.998
Then you'll know.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.479
Finally.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.960
I need to go make some risotto.

07:19.003 --> 07:22.180
[sighs]

07:22.224 --> 07:23.399
Oh boy.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.536
[buzzer]

07:33.104 --> 07:34.541
[meow]

07:35.455 --> 07:38.414
Eliot, I just fed you.

08:20.064 --> 08:22.937
Snuggle time on the couch it is.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.160
It's about time you came back.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.814
I was scared you'd never
show your face again

08:30.858 --> 08:34.208
after coming in last in
the Fantasy football pool.

08:34.251 --> 08:37.125
Remind me next time not to draft
a quarterback first.

08:37.168 --> 08:40.083
I will do no such thing.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.738
It's nice.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.260
Thank you for this, man.
Really.

08:43.304 --> 08:44.567
It's the least I could do.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
As many times as you've
let me stay with you

08:46.613 --> 08:48.266
in Portland and Chicago.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.703
Don't forget Missoula.

08:49.746 --> 08:52.314
How could I forget Missoula?

08:52.357 --> 08:53.837
Less than a week, I swear.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.404
Hey, it's all good.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.798
Enough time for me to,
uh, get your opinion

08:57.841 --> 09:02.367
on a little situation that
I can't quite figure out.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.108
Um, okay.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.109
There's a woman-

09:05.153 --> 09:06.546
There always is.

09:06.589 --> 09:07.721
Um, I'm serious this time.

09:07.764 --> 09:08.939
Okay, okay.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.854
What's the situation?

09:10.898 --> 09:14.466
I can't quite ask her out.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.555
What?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.078
That is not the Rick I know.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.297
No, it's 'cause I like her.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.038
I... I really, really like her.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.213
We... we had that...

09:22.257 --> 09:24.433
that ker-pow moment
when we first met-

09:24.476 --> 09:25.782
you know the one
I'm talking about.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.088
I do.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.524
And I can't forget it.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.874
She liked me, too.
I know she did.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.572
Why didn't you ask her out then?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.791
Uh, I was dating Megan.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.619
Megan, that disaster.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.012
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.057
Alright, never mind.
It just... sorry.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.624
Just... you were telling
me about...?

09:41.668 --> 09:42.886
Lucy.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.540
Yeah.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.804
But I made the classic mistake
of letting too much time pass

09:47.848 --> 09:52.461
after we first met and now I'm
not sure if she only sees me

09:52.504 --> 09:53.810
as a friend...

09:53.854 --> 09:55.812
[laughs]

09:55.856 --> 09:58.859
I can't believe the day has
arrived that Rick the romancer

09:58.902 --> 10:00.121
has met his match.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.384
Now, when do I get
to meet this nice girl?

10:02.427 --> 10:03.994
Uh, tomorrow night.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.866
I'm... I'm... I'm doing this
Valentine's theme cooking class

10:05.909 --> 10:07.955
down at the restaurant
and Lucy said she'd come.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.217
Do you think that you could-

10:09.260 --> 10:10.653
Count me in!

10:10.697 --> 10:12.089
Just, you know,

10:12.133 --> 10:14.048
obviously don't expect me
to cook anything edible.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.789
No, no, no, no.
I'm the chef.

10:15.832 --> 10:16.920
You're the wingman.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.008
Yes, chef.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.270
Thanks.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.707
No problem.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.335
Hi.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.815
Can I help you find something?

10:41.858 --> 10:44.252
Oh, you know, actually I
was hoping to catch Jamie.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.688
Is she here?

10:45.732 --> 10:48.343
Uh, she is not.

10:48.386 --> 10:49.474
Oh.

10:49.518 --> 10:50.562
Do you know when she'll be back?

10:50.606 --> 10:52.521
No, sorry I don't.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.157
Look out!

12:03.200 --> 12:05.942
Good catch.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.639
Sawyer.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.773
But soft, what light through
yonder window breaks.

12:10.817 --> 12:11.948
What?

12:11.992 --> 12:13.689
It's Romeo and Juliet.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.343
You look like you're up
on a balcony.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.953
There's no balcony.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.172
What?

12:18.215 --> 12:19.608
In the story she's standing
at a window.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.218
Everybody gets it wrong.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.873
Oh.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.440
I'm sorry.

12:25.483 --> 12:29.574
Um, ha, I... I'm just
completely thrown.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.272
Uh...

12:31.315 --> 12:33.448
Uh, yeah. So was I.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.755
I suppose I shouldn't be, this
was always your favourite place.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.234
Let's start again.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.714
Hi, Sawyer.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.847
Hey, Jamie.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.805
You dropped this.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.288
Thank you.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.900
I don't remember this courtyard.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.902
But you remember the tree,
right?

12:52.946 --> 12:54.338
The tree was always here.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.079
In fact, they actually built
the bookstore around it

12:56.123 --> 12:58.429
so they wouldn't have
to take it down.

12:58.473 --> 13:01.302
Yeah, this courtyard
was completely overgrown.

13:01.345 --> 13:04.479
I talked Mr. Ogilvy into letting
me clean it up a few years ago.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.568
And we're hoping to expand.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.918
Or I should say were hoping
to expand.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.093
You were?

13:10.137 --> 13:11.703
Not anymore?

13:11.747 --> 13:14.619
Uh, it's a long story.

13:14.663 --> 13:18.188
These developers are buying
all of the land

13:18.232 --> 13:20.408
in the business district and,

13:20.451 --> 13:22.976
I mean, you know they're
just gonna destroy everything.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.716
Destroy?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.545
Well, it's not decided yet but
they're having a meeting later

13:27.589 --> 13:30.374
to see if they're gonna move
forward with the project.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.376
Isn't that what business
developers do, though?

13:32.420 --> 13:36.380
They just tear everything down
and put up something hideous?

13:36.424 --> 13:38.339
It might not be hideous.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.036
Well, I'm sure they
will not leave

13:40.080 --> 13:42.038
my little bookstore unscathed.

13:42.082 --> 13:45.476
Wait, you-you bought
the bookstore?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.826
Yeah.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.915
Oh, yeah. I bought it
a few years ago.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.917
Just like I always said I would.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.527
I... I had no idea.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.920
Well, how would you?

13:53.963 --> 13:56.357
You've been gone for 15 years.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.055
Unless Rick
tells you everything.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.709
Not that thing.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.885
Well, enough about me.
How are you?

14:02.929 --> 14:04.365
What're you doing back here?

14:04.408 --> 14:07.542
I um... Oh.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.326
[phone ringing]

14:09.370 --> 14:10.588
Ooh, excuse me.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.894
Hold on. Um...

14:11.938 --> 14:13.287
Oh.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.897
Hey, uh Dana, could you...
could you...

14:14.941 --> 14:16.072
could you hold on just a sec?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.030
I gotta take this.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.205
Oh, of course.
Yeah, go.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.336
It was great to see you.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.990
Good to see you too.
Bye.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.384
Uh, hey, Dana.
Yeah, um...

14:23.427 --> 14:25.038
Bye.

14:34.003 --> 14:39.922
[indistinct conversations]

14:43.056 --> 14:45.058
[whispering]

14:47.843 --> 14:49.627
It's Jamie Vaughn, right?

14:49.671 --> 14:50.802
With True Love Books?

14:50.846 --> 14:51.934
And cafe, yes.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.196
Eric Duncan.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.632
I... I'm new to the city council
in the area.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.460
Nice to meet you, councilman.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.288
I'm, uh, glad you dropped by
to see the designs

14:58.332 --> 14:59.246
for the development.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.117
Proposed development.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.945
Proposed development.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.600
We're uh, hopeful that
it will generate

15:05.643 --> 15:07.689
some much-needed interest in
the local business community.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.430
Well, what about the Fire
and Ice Festival?

15:09.473 --> 15:11.606
It has drawn a lot of interest
to the area

15:11.649 --> 15:13.260
and been very popular
for the last few years.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.218
And I hope it continues to be,
but we should,

15:15.262 --> 15:16.480
uh, consider all options.

15:16.524 --> 15:17.917
Sure.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.267
I uh, I just have a million
questions starting with

15:20.310 --> 15:21.442
Councilman?

15:21.485 --> 15:22.573
what happens
to the existing stores

15:22.617 --> 15:23.531
if this project goes through?

15:23.574 --> 15:24.749
I... I... I'm sorry,

15:24.793 --> 15:25.837
could... could you
excuse me for a second?

15:25.881 --> 15:26.882
Oh...

15:31.060 --> 15:32.844
Hey, how are you?

15:33.671 --> 15:34.759
Yeah.

15:34.803 --> 15:35.804
Hi.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.284
Just one second, thank you.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.982
Jamie.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.679
My goodness.

15:41.723 --> 15:42.767
[gasps]

15:42.811 --> 15:44.508
Sawyer O'Dell?

15:44.552 --> 15:47.294
Hello, Anita.

15:47.337 --> 15:50.297
So nothing for 15 years
and then I see you twice

15:50.340 --> 15:51.994
in one hour?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.953
Uh... yeah.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.129
Well, I wasn't exactly sure

15:56.172 --> 15:58.000
how to approach
the subject earlier...

15:58.044 --> 16:00.263
Sawyer, are the designs
ready to show?

16:00.307 --> 16:02.091
Yes, they are cued up.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.353
Excellent.

16:03.397 --> 16:04.441
Hello.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.834
Are you local business owners?

16:05.877 --> 16:07.488
Yes, we are.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.446
I'm Anita Vaughn from Anita's
Flowers and this is my niece-

16:09.490 --> 16:11.274
Jamie Vaughn, True Love Books
and Cafe.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.797
Nice to meet you both.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.017
I hope you'll be as excited
as we are about the vision

16:15.061 --> 16:17.019
we have in mind for the project.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
Proposed project.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.067
Well, I'm confident
that Sawyer's designs

16:21.110 --> 16:24.505
will help persuade the council's
decision to go forward.

16:24.548 --> 16:25.854
Ready?

16:28.291 --> 16:31.555
Your designs?

16:31.599 --> 16:33.340
Yeah.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.610
Are you alright?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.788
I guess we'll find out.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.113
There you go.
Enjoy.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.334
I knew it.

17:11.377 --> 17:12.727
They're wiping out
all the stores.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.032
Just like Tanner Falls.

17:14.076 --> 17:14.990
Really?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.122
Yep, and Sawyer is a part of it.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.515
I cannot believe
he didn't tell me.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.734
How long did you two date?

17:20.778 --> 17:24.086
Well, we met in the eighth grade
but we didn't start dating

17:24.130 --> 17:25.174
until sophomore year.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.394
Were you prom queen and king?

17:27.436 --> 17:28.699
He was king.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.571
I was the girl who stayed late
in the library

17:30.614 --> 17:32.747
focusing on my books
and studies.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.053
Of course you were.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.489
Yeah. And you would think
those differences

17:35.532 --> 17:37.578
would have driven us apart,
especially being so young,

17:37.621 --> 17:40.624
but that wasn't
until after graduation.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.104
What happened?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.150
Well, right before he left
for college he came to me

17:44.193 --> 17:45.847
and he gave me this
big speech about

17:45.890 --> 17:48.502
how we were way too young
to be so serious,

17:48.545 --> 17:51.722
especially with him going off to
Columbia and me staying at Reed.

17:51.766 --> 17:55.509
You know, we had our
whole futures to consider.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.945
And that was that.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.729
We broke up.

17:58.773 --> 17:59.948
I'm sorry, honey.

17:59.991 --> 18:02.211
Oh, it was a long time ago.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.517
Have you tried these,
by the way?

18:03.560 --> 18:04.605
They are amazing.

18:04.648 --> 18:05.649
Yeah.

18:05.693 --> 18:06.694
Rick's workin' on a new recipe.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.130
Ooh.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.132
Oh, that reminds me,
you're coming with me tonight.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.264
Where?

18:11.307 --> 18:12.439
Rick's Valentine's
cooking class.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.875
And no "I'm writing" excuses.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.572
I need you there in case
I meet someone.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.271
That way we can discuss
the pros and cons.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.576
What about Rick?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.056
Yeah, I'll ask Rick's
opinion too,

18:21.100 --> 18:22.884
you know, guy's perspective.

18:22.927 --> 18:26.148
But first I need to meet
my own true love.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.498
Well, how do you know
you haven't already met him?

18:28.542 --> 18:31.327
I mean, Waterford isn't exactly
Portland in terms of population.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.285
Oh, no.

18:32.328 --> 18:33.851
I will know when I meet him.

18:33.895 --> 18:37.551
We will both have that moment
where we just know.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.074
You know?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.162
Hmm.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.555
Okay, this is going
somewhere else.

18:42.556 --> 18:45.298
No, I don't know.

18:48.039 --> 18:51.042
Why didn't you tell me that
Jamie bought True Love Books?

18:51.086 --> 18:53.610
Remember a few years ago when
I casually mentioned

18:53.654 --> 18:57.527
she was dating that dentist and
your reaction was to tell me

18:57.571 --> 19:00.443
to never let you know anything
about Jamie

19:00.487 --> 19:02.837
because it distracted you?

19:02.880 --> 19:03.794
Vaguely.

19:03.838 --> 19:04.839
Well, you did.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.058
So I didn't.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.408
Anything else you're
not telling me?

19:08.451 --> 19:10.801
Uh, she's not happy
about the project.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.152
Yeah, yeah, I get that already.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.763
And she's single.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.682
So what... what happened
with the dentist?

19:21.725 --> 19:24.075
He moved to Texas last year.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.555
So they weren't that serious.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.254
Oh, they were serious.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.516
He got some-

19:29.559 --> 19:31.344
some job offer that
he couldn't turn down,

19:31.387 --> 19:33.868
he asked her to move with him,
she declined.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.086
Why?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.610
You'll have to ask her.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.133
Given how she reacted when
she found out I was working

19:38.177 --> 19:41.397
with Ridley that feels
highly unlikely.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.399
Is she dating anyone now?

19:43.443 --> 19:45.358
No one.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.404
She's on a romantic hiatus.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.493
That does sounds like something
she would say.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.625
Yeah.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.192
Lucy thinks that,
instead of dating,

19:53.235 --> 19:57.152
Jamie pours all her heart
into the bookstore.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.938
The very one that you're trying
to tear down.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.291
Wha?

20:14.343 --> 20:15.953
We have to find a way
to fight back.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.085
Okay.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.129
But how?

20:18.173 --> 20:19.348
I have exactly no idea.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.654
But we have got to come up
with something.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.831
I mean, this place just means
to much for them

20:23.874 --> 20:27.356
to cavalierly tear it down.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.184
Oops.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.076
What is that?

20:52.120 --> 20:53.469
It's a book.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.298
[gasps]

20:56.342 --> 20:57.473
It's not a book.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.954
These are valentines.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.131
These are so cute.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.960
These are valentines
from old True Love customers

21:06.003 --> 21:07.614
to True Love Books.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.180
This is ridiculously sweet.

21:09.224 --> 21:13.837
Ah, look, this one says
it's from 1965.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.797
Mr. Ogilvy must have kept them.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.279
"Dear True Love, without you
we wouldn't have had our first

21:20.322 --> 21:22.933
Valentine's Day coffee and
found our own true loves.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.631
You'll always have a place in our hearts.

21:24.674 --> 21:25.980
Love, Chris and Cara."

21:26.023 --> 21:27.547
Aww.

21:27.590 --> 21:30.550
"A valentine of appreciation
to True Love Books and Cafe.

21:30.593 --> 21:33.640
You brought us together in
classics and helped us find

21:33.683 --> 21:35.598
our happily ever after.

21:35.642 --> 21:38.384
Forever grateful,
Sam and Lauren."

21:38.427 --> 21:40.168
We should put these out
for the customers.

21:40.211 --> 21:44.303
Yes, and show how important
True Love is to the community.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.129
That's it.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.130
What's it?

21:46.174 --> 21:47.828
That's how we fight back.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.177
Yes, yes, that's right.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.310
Valentine's cards from old
True Love customers.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.963
People who met there.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.357
Yeah, and some of them date back
to the middle of last century.

21:55.401 --> 22:00.101
Yeah, and this year alone we've
had four proposals in the store.

22:00.144 --> 22:03.234
Now, isn't that a legacy
worth saving?

22:04.018 --> 22:07.151
And when is it going to run?

22:07.195 --> 22:08.936
Great, thank you so much!

22:08.979 --> 22:09.632
We're in!

22:09.676 --> 22:11.417
Yes!

22:12.983 --> 22:14.507
[sighs]

22:14.550 --> 22:16.857
Of course you're here.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.250
This is a small town.

22:19.294 --> 22:23.167
Okay, everybody, if you all
would find a cooking station.

22:23.211 --> 22:25.387
Jamie, would you like to...

22:25.431 --> 22:28.390
Yes, I would.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.913
Well, okay, thank you.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.132
Alright.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.352
Wow. You look great.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.223
Thank you, you do, too.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.355
Hi.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.268
Do you want to...

22:37.312 --> 22:38.139
Sure.

22:38.182 --> 22:39.227
- I'm Lucy.
- I'm Quentin.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.707
I like your sweater.

22:40.750 --> 22:41.534
Alright, chef.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.492
What is on the menu?

22:43.536 --> 22:46.190
Uh, we're gonna start off
with an arugula salad,

22:46.234 --> 22:49.237
marinated figs, cherry tomatoes
and feta cheese.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.978
Mmm.

22:51.021 --> 22:55.199
Followed by our entree
of miso glazed salmon,

22:55.243 --> 22:57.201
roasted potatoes, and bok choy.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.681
I love glazed salmon.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.030
[laughs]

23:00.074 --> 23:01.467
What's for dessert?

23:01.510 --> 23:02.729
Raspberry chocolate torte.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.599
Mmm.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.079
Yes, ha!

23:07.951 --> 23:08.909
What?

23:08.952 --> 23:11.215
Oh, nothing.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.304
I mean, I just think if a guy
wants to say something

23:13.348 --> 23:15.916
to a woman like
"hey, I like you" or

23:15.959 --> 23:17.874
"hey, I'm actively employed
by the company trying

23:17.918 --> 23:19.267
to tear down your store"

23:19.310 --> 23:22.313
that direct communication
goes a lot farther than

23:22.357 --> 23:24.446
dancing around the topic or,
you know, being vague about it,

23:24.490 --> 23:26.274
but you guys do you.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.754
Okay, if one partner would
head to the back

23:27.797 --> 23:30.887
and grab some salad fixings.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.149
Got it!

23:34.325 --> 23:36.066
I'm sorry I didn't mention
my involvement with Ridley

23:36.110 --> 23:37.546
when I first saw you
at the bookshop.

23:37.590 --> 23:38.591
Thank you.

23:38.634 --> 23:41.332
But, in my defence,

23:41.376 --> 23:44.161
I didn't know it was your
bookshop until just then.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.467
But you knew it was True Love

23:45.511 --> 23:47.164
and you know how much
that place means to me.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.906
Well, yeah, but
not for a long time.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.473
No, it wasn't a long time ago
to me.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.562
And if you think that finding
out my ex being a part of

23:53.606 --> 23:55.608
team Ridley is gonna stop me
from doing what I need to do

23:55.651 --> 23:58.828
to save True Love then you have
another thing coming.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.441
What're you cooking up?

24:02.484 --> 24:03.616
Miso glazed salmon.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.139
Weren't you paying attention?

24:05.182 --> 24:08.011
I was paying attention and
you are planning something.

24:08.055 --> 24:08.795
Sawyer?

24:08.838 --> 24:10.100
What?

24:10.144 --> 24:12.233
You wanna give everybody else
some arugula?

24:12.276 --> 24:13.408
Oh.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.803
Sorry.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.461
"Is romance on your mind?

24:22.504 --> 24:24.463
True Love Books and Cafe
in Waterford may be

24:24.506 --> 24:25.768
the place to go.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.117
With dozens of proposals

24:27.161 --> 24:29.555
and successful first dates in its history,

24:29.598 --> 24:32.688
some say the bookstore
and cafe is love's lucky charm.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.342
And while we'll
never know for sure,

24:34.385 --> 24:37.388
many former customers believe
in its romantic magic so much

24:37.432 --> 24:39.695
they've been sending
thank you valentines

24:39.739 --> 24:42.524
to the store for decades.

24:42.568 --> 24:46.136
Isn't this the type of
Waterford legacy worth saving?"

24:46.180 --> 24:47.790
This is wonderful, Jamie.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.531
Was the article your idea?

24:49.575 --> 24:50.924
I did the interview yesterday.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.403
Yeah, I probably should have
thought of it before

24:52.447 --> 24:55.015
but it didn't occur to me
until I found the valentines

24:55.058 --> 24:57.017
and with the vote coming up,
which did you hear?

24:57.060 --> 24:58.061
Mm-mm.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.236
It got moved up
to February 14th.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.411
Valentine's Day?

25:00.455 --> 25:01.543
So soon.

25:01.587 --> 25:02.849
I guess Ridley's putting
pressure on them

25:02.892 --> 25:04.546
to make a decision.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.636
But honestly, this article has
generated so much interest

25:07.680 --> 25:09.072
in the store.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.901
We have people coming in
from Portland and Eugene.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.773
Lucy called this morning and
said there was a line already

25:13.816 --> 25:14.817
outside the door.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.558
Will it be enough, though?

25:16.602 --> 25:17.864
What do you mean?

25:17.907 --> 25:20.257
If you stop Ridley Properties
this time

25:20.301 --> 25:22.695
won't a development team
just come in right behind them?

25:22.738 --> 25:25.785
I mean, it sure seems like the
council has their sights set

25:25.828 --> 25:29.005
on wiping this whole area clean
and starting over.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.921
Actually it's pretty evenly
split which means that Eric

25:31.965 --> 25:35.272
will have the final say and
he is very open to listening.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.624
Or he notices a pretty woman
is the face of the opposition.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.755
It's not like that.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.148
Oh, honey.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.280
I saw how he looked at you
at the cooking class.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.021
Sawyer saw, too.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.414
Sawyer?

25:46.457 --> 25:47.110
Hmm?

25:47.154 --> 25:48.155
What did Sawyer say?

25:48.198 --> 25:49.286
Oh, he didn't say anything.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.374
I mean, after your little spat.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.593
It was not a spat.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.029
Couples have spats.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.118
We had a vigorous disagreement.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.380
Oh, however you want to put it.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.253
The point is Sawyer kept
watching both of you

25:59.296 --> 26:00.646
during the whole class.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.038
Well, there's nothing going on
with me and Eric.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.039
Especially after-

26:03.083 --> 26:04.214
Sawyer?

26:04.258 --> 26:05.433
Matt.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.478
The guy I was just dating
who moved away.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.524
But to be fair to Matt he wanted
you to go with him.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.047
Unlike Sawyer, who just left.

26:11.091 --> 26:11.961
Yeah, to go to college.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.049
Who's side are you on?

26:13.093 --> 26:14.050
Oh, always yours.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.312
[laughs]

26:15.356 --> 26:16.879
Which is why I'm so proud
of you for that.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.272
Thank you.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.276
I wonder what the feedback will
be like from the Ridley side.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.017
Hmm.

26:24.670 --> 26:28.717
Your goal was to persuade the
community to embrace our deal.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.197
I know.

26:30.240 --> 26:36.595
To be very clear this is
the opposite of that.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.162
I understand, which is
why I'm working to meet

26:39.206 --> 26:41.164
with as many of the owners
as possible.

26:41.208 --> 26:44.472
Well, perhaps you should
concentrate on Miss Vaughn.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.910
Look, I know that Jamie can be
a little passionate

26:47.954 --> 26:49.129
about her causes-

26:49.172 --> 26:53.089
Jamie? How well do you know
Miss Vaughn?

26:53.133 --> 26:55.918
Well, I haven't seen her
since high school.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.312
But in high school?

26:58.355 --> 27:01.315
We... dated.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.665
She was your high school
sweetheart?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.014
We never referred
to ourselves as-

27:05.058 --> 27:06.363
Sawyer.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.758
Yes. We were high school
sweethearts.

27:09.802 --> 27:10.759
And now?

27:10.803 --> 27:11.934
Now nothing.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.501
Well, a friendly nothing.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.286
We did just take a cooking
class together the other day.

27:16.330 --> 27:20.987
That's good, because there
can be no lingering animosity

27:21.030 --> 27:24.207
between the two of you
that could imperil this deal.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.513
I got it.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.384
I got it under control.

we are almost out of
sugar cookies.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.251
This is fantastic.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.426
That'll teach him.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.689
Who? Mr. Arugula?

28:10.732 --> 28:12.516
Mm-hmm.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.256
Oh.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.431
What?

28:14.475 --> 28:15.258
Woah.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.172
Matt?

28:16.216 --> 28:18.697
What does your ex want?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.699
And speaking of blast
from the past...

28:20.742 --> 28:22.483
Hmm?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.184
Oh.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.708
Yeah.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.105
Nice article.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.063
Thanks.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.499
- But I have to ask.
- Hmm?

28:38.542 --> 28:42.111
What did you think of
my actual designs?

28:42.155 --> 28:45.898
They're... beautiful.

28:45.941 --> 28:48.030
And they will fit right in.

28:48.074 --> 28:50.032
In Sweden.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.294
Sweden?

28:51.338 --> 28:53.470
Yeah, like Nordic minimalism,

28:53.514 --> 28:59.085
which I am actually a huge
fan of, it's just...

28:59.128 --> 29:01.783
not Waterford.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.785
Um, I should get back to work.

29:03.829 --> 29:04.786
Yeah.

29:04.830 --> 29:05.744
In my bookstore.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.964
'Cause it's busy.

29:11.924 --> 29:14.491
I have to do something
to counter Jamie's article.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.667
Good luck fighting against
True Love.

29:16.711 --> 29:17.886
Have you been by there today?

29:17.930 --> 29:19.192
It's like a mosh pit.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.803
Yeah, it's like every unattached
person in town

29:21.847 --> 29:23.892
all of a sudden has an interest
in the written word,

29:23.936 --> 29:26.155
including Quentin.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.461
Who's Quentin?

29:27.504 --> 29:30.420
Sweater guy from
my cooking class.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.726
Yeah.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.337
Lucy and him exchanged
phone numbers and now,

29:34.381 --> 29:37.079
according to Lucy who likes to
tell me these sorts of things,

29:37.123 --> 29:39.473
they're making plans for dinner,

29:39.516 --> 29:42.476
which is not the outcome
that I was going for.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.130
You know, Jamie had a point.

29:44.173 --> 29:46.175
You should tell Lucy
how you feel.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.873
Yeah, maybe I should
have told her

29:47.916 --> 29:51.137
when she was 100 percent single
but now she's not.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.356
Woah. They've only just talked.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.923
She's still 98 percent single.

29:54.967 --> 29:55.924
Whatever.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.970
What about you and Jamie?

29:58.013 --> 30:00.842
Wow, there was no effort
at subtlety

30:00.886 --> 30:02.539
in that conversation pivot.

30:02.583 --> 30:03.802
Nope.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.368
So?

30:05.412 --> 30:08.719
Have you talked to her since
your cooking class disaster?

30:08.763 --> 30:10.199
Briefly.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.680
And meanwhile, only one store
in the business district

30:12.723 --> 30:14.334
is willing to sit down with me.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.031
Olga's Dance Studio.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.860
That's the benefit of her having
lived here longer than you.

30:18.904 --> 30:21.602
Jamie's in mostly
everybody's ear.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.561
Yeah, but my sort of being from
Waterford is one of the reasons

30:24.605 --> 30:26.433
why Ridley gave me this shot.

30:26.476 --> 30:29.175
If they hire me I won't have to
travel so far for every project

30:29.218 --> 30:31.742
and I might maybe even
eventually be able

30:31.786 --> 30:33.788
to buy a house.

30:33.832 --> 30:41.404
You need to reintroduce yourself
to folks in a friendlier way.

30:41.448 --> 30:44.973
Embrace the community.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.628
Embrace the community.

31:25.187 --> 31:28.364
"Dearest, I know you
told me not to write,

31:28.408 --> 31:30.758
but you also told me
to not wait for you

31:30.801 --> 31:34.153
while you go fight
for our country.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.112
But you see, my darling,
it is quite impossible for me

31:37.156 --> 31:39.158
to let you go

31:39.201 --> 31:43.118
and so I will wait for you and
give you glimpses of the world

31:43.162 --> 31:46.469
you have here
upon your return."

31:46.513 --> 31:48.602
They were so in love.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.169
Who?

31:50.212 --> 31:52.345
Mary and Harris, the original
owners of the book store.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.869
I found some of their letters
in the Story of Us box.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.959
Harris broke up with Mary
before he was shipped overseas

31:58.003 --> 32:01.310
for World War II because he
didn't want her waiting for him.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.182
But she ignored him
and kept writing anyway.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.096
Good girl.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.488
Yeah.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.099
Her letters about what
was happening in Waterford

32:07.142 --> 32:09.188
is what kept him going
while he was away.

32:09.231 --> 32:12.495
Nowadays she'd probably send him
texts with some emojis mixed in.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.322
Yeah.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.149
So not the same.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.672
[sighs]

32:15.716 --> 32:17.457
Sounds romantic.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.198
Which makes sense for a couple
who started a bookstore

32:19.241 --> 32:21.156
called True Love.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.941
I mean, wouldn't that be nice?

32:22.984 --> 32:25.508
To have someone who'd want
to do something so creative

32:25.552 --> 32:28.120
with you like start a bookstore?

32:28.163 --> 32:30.687
I thought you were
on a romantic hiatus.

32:30.731 --> 32:34.039
Doesn't mean I can't recognize
romance in other people.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.478
Mm, thank you.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.481
Wait, what?

32:43.265 --> 32:45.006
Does that say Ridley?

32:45.050 --> 32:47.530
Uh, don't look now, but I...

32:48.488 --> 32:50.229
[gasps]

32:57.018 --> 32:59.716
No way.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.593
I love Waterford.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.769
My mom and I moved here
when I was 12 years old.

33:08.812 --> 33:11.728
Chuck, your dad gave me my
first job at the pizzeria.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.165
Oh, I remember.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.777
So this isn't just gonna be some
random tear-down.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.649
I'm a hometown boy who's
come back to his roots

33:19.693 --> 33:21.912
to do what I can to help
make things better

33:21.956 --> 33:25.307
for a place that I care
a lot about.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.830
I'm sorry.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.484
Hometown boy?

33:28.528 --> 33:29.398
Heh.

33:29.442 --> 33:30.617
That's me.

33:30.660 --> 33:34.012
And when was the last time
you were here?

33:34.055 --> 33:36.318
Well, it's...
it's been a while.

33:36.362 --> 33:39.669
Since you graduated
high school, right?

33:39.713 --> 33:41.062
About that.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.543
So... How did you even come up
with these designs

33:43.586 --> 33:46.850
if you haven't even been here
in a decade and a half?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.417
Well, I... I don't need
to be on location

33:48.461 --> 33:50.115
in order to create my designs.

33:50.158 --> 33:52.465
Oh, what? Because it's
all just the same?

33:52.508 --> 33:55.207
Just some stores
to be torn down?

33:55.250 --> 33:56.512
Not at all.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.602
History to be ignored?

34:00.777 --> 34:04.259
Beth, how long have you had
your hobby warehouse?

34:04.303 --> 34:05.434
Thirty-five years.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.001
Thirty-five years!

34:07.045 --> 34:11.310
Thirty-five years. People have
been coming to your store

34:11.353 --> 34:13.572
for everything they need
from scrapbooking needs

34:13.616 --> 34:15.792
to their homemade
Christmas decorations.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.054
That's right.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.708
But because of where your store
is located,

34:18.752 --> 34:23.496
some people in Portland, think
it would make a great place

34:23.539 --> 34:28.196
for some retail space-station-
like mega development,

34:28.239 --> 34:31.243
forcing you to sell
your life's work.

34:31.286 --> 34:33.201
Is that right?

34:33.245 --> 34:35.681
It's not.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.902
It is not.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.904
It's not a space station.

34:40.947 --> 34:42.993
It's not.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.175
Hey, Lucy.

34:50.217 --> 34:52.219
Let me help you with that.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.395
Thank you.

34:53.438 --> 34:54.396
[grunts]

34:54.440 --> 34:55.223
Where's Jamie?

34:55.266 --> 34:57.443
Jousting with her ex.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.358
Sawyer has her going, huh?

34:59.401 --> 35:01.403
That and trying to save
the store she's loved

35:01.447 --> 35:04.667
since childhood, and sunk
her life savings into.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.408
There.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.149
How do I look?

35:08.193 --> 35:10.020
The only answer is gorgeous.

35:10.064 --> 35:12.762
Oh, aren't you sweet?

35:12.806 --> 35:14.590
Why do you ask?

35:14.634 --> 35:16.984
Uh, Quentin's stopping by.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.073
Sweater guy?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.292
It's February, Rick.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.945
People wear sweaters.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.338
You have sweaters.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.427
Yeah, but I make 'em look cool.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.646
[laughs]

35:26.689 --> 35:30.084
So uh, do you like
this Quentin guy?

35:30.128 --> 35:34.828
I mean, you get that wow
moment that you talk about?

35:34.871 --> 35:37.222
I don't know if I'd call it "wow",

35:37.265 --> 35:39.702
but he's nice and handsome.

35:39.746 --> 35:42.531
Uh-huh, but no "wow"?

35:42.575 --> 35:45.578
No, I haven't had many of those.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.580
Only one, actually.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.715
What happened with that guy?

35:52.759 --> 35:54.108
Nothing.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.590
Absolutely nothing happened
with that guy.

35:57.633 --> 36:00.854
You two uh...
never went out?

36:00.897 --> 36:02.334
Nope.

36:02.377 --> 36:05.772
I thought for sure that we would
but it never happened.

36:05.815 --> 36:08.688
Maybe our timing
was just off or...

36:08.731 --> 36:10.777
maybe it was all one-sided.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.130
So where is he now?

36:16.783 --> 36:17.784
Lucy.

36:18.828 --> 36:19.742
Hi.

36:19.786 --> 36:20.917
Quentin!

36:23.224 --> 36:24.225
Hi.

36:25.879 --> 36:26.880
For you.

36:26.923 --> 36:30.623
Aww, that's...
thank you.

36:31.711 --> 36:34.801
I'm gonna go make some risotto.

36:40.459 --> 36:41.199
Bye.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.025
Bye.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.331
Thank you.

36:45.028 --> 36:47.248
No fair, you already know
everyone in Waterford.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.771
Thanks, Sawyer!

36:48.815 --> 36:50.251
[laughs]

36:50.295 --> 36:53.733
Well, it seems the uh, hometown
boy is making progress.

36:53.776 --> 36:56.736
Well, you had, what, a 15-year
head start on me?

36:56.779 --> 36:57.519
Six.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.781
Six years.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.261
I only came back to Waterford
six years ago.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.394
Hold on, you didn't come back
right after college?

37:02.437 --> 37:03.786
Mm-mm.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.136
Jamie!

37:06.180 --> 37:07.790
There you are.

37:07.834 --> 37:08.704
Karen.

37:08.748 --> 37:09.618
Hello.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.403
I never see you anymore.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.405
Well, we've been busy.

37:13.448 --> 37:16.146
Being busy is the best way
to get over heartbreak.

37:16.190 --> 37:19.324
That's certainly been Matt's
motto this past year.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.934
I'm Karen Van Horn.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.152
Sawyer O'Dell.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.937
Sawyer?

37:23.980 --> 37:25.155
Jamie's ex.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.896
- Uh, from a long-
- Long.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.115
Time ago.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.465
I see. Matt talks
about you all the time.

37:30.509 --> 37:31.466
He does?

37:31.510 --> 37:32.467
Matt?

37:32.511 --> 37:33.642
My son.

37:33.686 --> 37:35.296
Jamie and Matt dated-

37:35.340 --> 37:36.079
A long-

37:36.123 --> 37:36.906
Last year.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.081
Time ago.

37:38.125 --> 37:41.171
A year's not that long ago.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.696
And since we're, uh,
on the subject of time,

37:43.739 --> 37:46.394
Jamie and I have a lunch
reservation right now.

37:46.438 --> 37:47.526
Yes, we do, right now.

37:47.569 --> 37:48.788
It was so good to see you,
though.

37:48.831 --> 37:49.789
I'm so sorry.

37:49.832 --> 37:50.659
Buh-bye.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.226
Nice to meet you.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.143
I take it she's not
your biggest fan?

37:56.186 --> 37:57.840
Actually it's the opposite.

37:57.884 --> 38:01.409
Yeah, if she had her way Matt
and I would be together.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.324
What are the chances of that?

38:03.368 --> 38:07.328
Considering he's in Texas and
I'm here I'm gonna go with none.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.895
I think we're safe now.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.463
This reminds me of when we
skipped algebra in high school.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.595
And Coach Taylor caught us.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.250
And you miraculously talked
our way out of detention.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.774
Well, you're not the only one
who can be charming you know.

38:18.818 --> 38:21.255
I'm well aware of how charming
you can be.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.389
[laughs]

38:24.432 --> 38:27.348
Believe it or not I was
really happy to see you

38:27.392 --> 38:29.785
in the bookstore again.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.614
Before things got complicated.

38:32.658 --> 38:33.963
Complicated.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.878
That is one word.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.880
I was glad to see you, too.

38:37.924 --> 38:39.578
Yeah?

38:39.621 --> 38:42.276
It reminded me of how
we first met.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.104
I don't remember you trying
to bean me in the head

38:44.147 --> 38:45.671
with Jane Austen
when we first met.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.977
Uh, no, but it was
in the same bookstore.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.457
Yes.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.112
Right where, uh, romance
and Sci-Fi genres converge.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.374
Right there on the shelf,

38:53.418 --> 38:55.637
the book we were both
looking for.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.160
[together] The Princess Bride.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.248
Yeah.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.554
You had just arrived
in Waterford.

38:59.598 --> 39:00.947
Yeah, my fifth town
in four years

39:00.990 --> 39:02.340
and you were my second friend.

39:02.383 --> 39:03.689
Rick will always be first.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.038
But you'll always be prettier.

39:05.081 --> 39:05.865
[laughs]

39:05.908 --> 39:06.953
Don't tell him that.

39:06.996 --> 39:07.954
I would never, it would
destroy him.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.912
[laughs]

39:09.956 --> 39:13.742
Okay, I gotta confess.

39:13.786 --> 39:17.485
I... I should have said
something earlier but um...

39:17.529 --> 39:18.356
I'm hungry.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.313
[laughs]

39:19.357 --> 39:21.271
Me too! I skipped breakfast!

39:21.315 --> 39:22.316
Lunch?

39:24.100 --> 39:26.538
Lunch.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.148
I know just the place.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.941
I cannot believe you're eating
ice cream in this weather.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.029
It's the Sundae Madness.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.640
I can't believe
they still have it.

39:41.683 --> 39:43.859
I think that was your exact
order on our very first date.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.992
Oh, it was.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.211
Mmm.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.822
I've missed this so much.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.085
I've been to a million
other ice cream shops.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.913
Nothing compares to Jeff's.

39:53.956 --> 39:56.437
Oh, I missed it like crazy
when I was in Minnesota.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.743
When were you in Minnesota?

39:57.786 --> 39:59.440
Right after I graduated
from Reed.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.487
I did an internship at a
newspaper in Minneapolis

40:02.530 --> 40:04.097
and they made me a full-time
reporter.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.620
Mostly human interest stories.

40:05.664 --> 40:06.708
Did you like it?

40:06.752 --> 40:08.144
I did.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.756
Yeah, I learned a lot
about storytelling that way.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.062
But eventually I came to realize

40:13.106 --> 40:15.674
just how much I missed
this place.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.067
So six years ago
when I got back,

40:18.111 --> 40:20.287
uh, Mr. Ogilvy made me manager
of the store

40:20.330 --> 40:23.986
and then when he decided to
retire I knew I had to buy it.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.466
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.728
[clears throat]

40:26.772 --> 40:29.731
You living outside of Oregon,
however, does.

40:29.775 --> 40:30.602
Hmm.

40:30.645 --> 40:31.429
I never thought you would.

40:31.472 --> 40:32.560
I know.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.083
You said that when you broke up
with me

40:34.127 --> 40:35.041
all those years ago.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.086
Mmm, we broke up
with each other.

40:37.130 --> 40:38.087
Did we?

40:38.131 --> 40:39.480
I thought we did.

40:39.524 --> 40:42.178
No, like you had
a very good point.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.311
People should go out
into the world,

40:44.354 --> 40:46.966
see other things,
have other experiences,

40:47.009 --> 40:49.490
before they decide where
they want to settle down.

40:49.534 --> 40:53.015
That's what I did
and that's how I know.

40:53.059 --> 40:55.061
This is where I wanna be.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.457
So are you still writing?

40:59.500 --> 41:00.806
Here and there.

41:00.849 --> 41:02.068
Hmm.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.678
Published anything?

41:03.722 --> 41:05.593
Not yet.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.465
Have you tried?

41:07.508 --> 41:08.770
I haven't.

41:08.814 --> 41:10.380
Huh.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.513
Why not?

41:12.557 --> 41:14.123
Probably for the same reason
everybody else

41:14.167 --> 41:16.474
who writes but doesn't publish.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.998
Fear of rejection.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.913
Rejection hurts.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.350
Duck crossing?

41:23.393 --> 41:24.699
[laughs]

41:24.743 --> 41:26.658
Yeah. Yeah, those went in
a little while ago.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.660
Do you remember
Mrs. Montenegro?

41:28.703 --> 41:30.052
The woman on Ashland Avenue.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.576
Exactly.

41:31.619 --> 41:34.448
So turns out she was buying land
on the outskirts of town,

41:34.492 --> 41:37.233
just little by little,
until eventually she got

41:37.277 --> 41:38.974
the local preservation society

41:39.018 --> 41:41.890
to designate the area
a bird sanctuary.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.109
Really?

41:43.152 --> 41:45.459
Yes, but unforeseen result
is we've now had

41:45.503 --> 41:46.678
an influx of ducks.

41:46.721 --> 41:47.722
Ducks?

41:47.766 --> 41:48.941
Oh yeah, ducks.

41:48.984 --> 41:50.333
Hundreds of ducks.

41:50.377 --> 41:52.248
And they obviously follow
the rules of the road?

41:52.292 --> 41:53.336
Well...

41:53.380 --> 41:54.424
[laughs]

41:54.468 --> 41:55.513
I don't know if they actually-

41:55.556 --> 41:56.731
Hey, Sawyer!

41:57.471 --> 41:59.865
Dad wants to say hi.

41:59.908 --> 42:02.389
Uh... I-I should...

42:02.432 --> 42:05.523
Oh yeah, yeah go ahead.

42:28.850 --> 42:30.809
Hey, what's all this?

42:30.852 --> 42:32.332
I'm doing a last minute
Valentine theme

42:32.375 --> 42:34.334
wine tasting down
at the restaurant.

42:34.377 --> 42:35.465
What made you think of this?

42:35.509 --> 42:36.989
Ooh, let me guess, Lucy?

42:37.032 --> 42:38.381
Yeah, Lucy.

42:38.425 --> 42:42.603
I, uh, I saw her down
at the park and we talked.

42:42.647 --> 42:45.737
Now I don't know if I'm seeing
what I want to see

42:45.780 --> 42:47.565
but I feel like-

42:47.608 --> 42:49.741
mayb-okay, probably not, but-

42:49.784 --> 42:53.658
Rick, you need to tell her
how you feel.

42:53.701 --> 42:57.096
Okay, so I'm gonna do
a wine tasting,

42:57.139 --> 43:00.099
create a fun,
friendly environment

43:00.142 --> 43:03.232
where I can tell her how I feel.

43:03.276 --> 43:04.886
You're gonna be there, right?

43:04.930 --> 43:06.758
To help me out and make me look
good like you did the other day?

43:06.801 --> 43:07.976
You don't need me for that.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.587
[sighs]

43:10.500 --> 43:12.851
Yeah, they were
just shaking hands.

43:12.894 --> 43:15.375
Just Sawyer, Chuck,
and Chuck's dad,

43:15.418 --> 43:16.898
like they were old friends.

43:16.942 --> 43:19.074
Or old employer-employee.

43:19.118 --> 43:20.598
From an eternity ago.

43:20.641 --> 43:22.687
Well, I remember every person
I've ever employed.

43:22.730 --> 43:24.123
Yeah, well you're good
like that.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.951
And so is Chuck,
and Chuck's dad.

43:25.994 --> 43:27.953
Yeah, it's Sawyer I'm mad at.

43:27.996 --> 43:29.607
Mad?

43:29.650 --> 43:31.217
Okay, I'm frustrated.

43:31.260 --> 43:32.740
I'm not mad.

43:32.784 --> 43:34.916
He is winning people over right
and left and now I think

43:34.960 --> 43:37.832
Olga's Dance Studio is gonna
back the proposal.

43:37.876 --> 43:41.096
Well, it's not just
Sawyer's charm.

43:41.140 --> 43:43.185
What do you mean?

43:50.628 --> 43:52.194
Is that...?

43:52.238 --> 43:54.022
Mm-hmm.

43:54.066 --> 43:57.765
A 20 percent increase
from their last offer.

43:57.809 --> 43:58.984
I'm not gonna accept it.

43:59.027 --> 44:00.376
Aunt Anita.

44:00.420 --> 44:03.379
No, this is my home, and
the store is still my joy.

44:03.423 --> 44:05.991
And besides, I'm too young
to retire just yet.

44:06.034 --> 44:09.342
Yeah, but if you got that
that means the others did, too.

44:09.385 --> 44:11.300
Mm-hmm.

44:11.344 --> 44:13.476
[sighs]

44:13.520 --> 44:15.478
It's a good offer, Jamie.

44:15.522 --> 44:17.524
I could pay off
my second mortgage.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.352
And aren't we just delaying
the inevitable?

44:19.395 --> 44:20.658
No.

44:20.701 --> 44:22.529
No, the vote on the 14th
is to see if the council

44:22.572 --> 44:25.706
even recommends going forward
with the project.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.534
We stop it there and it's done.

44:27.577 --> 44:29.928
We all stick together and we say
no we can actually sway

44:29.971 --> 44:31.538
the council's vote.

44:31.581 --> 44:34.062
I know councilwoman Baker's
in favour of it going forward,

44:34.106 --> 44:36.935
and her husband owns Golf Mart
over on 3rd Street.

44:36.978 --> 44:38.588
Now that's a big chunk of land.

44:38.632 --> 44:41.896
Yeah, but all of us together
is even more land.

44:41.940 --> 44:45.726
More property, more voice.

44:45.770 --> 44:48.250
How many of you all remember
what happened at Tanner Falls?

44:48.294 --> 44:49.687
[groans]

44:49.730 --> 44:51.253
I mean, some of those store
owners didn't even have

44:51.297 --> 44:54.561
a place to go back to or a place
they could even recognize.

44:54.604 --> 44:57.999
We all want what's best for
Waterford and we understand

44:58.043 --> 45:00.698
the importance of bringing
in new people to the district,

45:00.741 --> 45:03.875
it's why we started the Fire
and Ice Festival.

45:03.918 --> 45:09.010
Look, you all know how much
I love my bookstore.

45:09.054 --> 45:12.013
I mean, even before it was mine.

45:12.057 --> 45:15.495
But I believe all of you love
your stores just as much.

45:15.538 --> 45:18.454
I've been at the same dance
studio for over 20 years.

45:18.498 --> 45:19.847
I don't know where I'd be
without it.

45:19.891 --> 45:21.240
Right.

45:21.283 --> 45:23.808
And if we are all one voice
at that council vote

45:23.851 --> 45:26.941
maybe you won't have to, Olga.

45:30.292 --> 45:34.079
What's on your mind, Chuck?

45:34.122 --> 45:35.341
Well...

45:36.559 --> 45:38.344
Chuck Blevins
from the pizza place

45:38.387 --> 45:40.563
sent in his agreement
this morning.

45:40.607 --> 45:42.000
Well, that's good news.

45:42.043 --> 45:43.784
He liked the idea of one of
his dad's old employees

45:43.828 --> 45:45.699
being in charge of the redesign.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.266
Good job.

45:47.309 --> 45:49.703
How's it going
with the bookstore?

45:50.878 --> 45:53.141
Jamie and I are talking.

45:53.185 --> 45:55.665
About her supporting
the project?

45:55.709 --> 45:59.278
It's a work in progress.

45:59.321 --> 46:02.368
As long as there is progress
before the council vote.

46:02.411 --> 46:06.111
There's a reason Ridley
chose you for this.

46:06.154 --> 46:08.853
I remember.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.129
Eliot!

46:24.172 --> 46:26.784
Aww.

46:31.614 --> 46:33.573
Oh, Eliot.

46:33.616 --> 46:37.533
What'll we do if we can't save
this place, huh?

46:39.361 --> 46:41.711
Okay, there you go, bud.

46:47.892 --> 46:49.894
There you go, bud.

47:03.037 --> 47:06.693
"Darling Mary, words alone
cannot express

47:06.736 --> 47:08.956
how grateful I am
that you did not listen

47:09.000 --> 47:11.132
when I told you not to write.

47:11.176 --> 47:14.875
Each story you relay to me of
the people back in Waterford

47:14.919 --> 47:18.531
reminds me anew what
it is I'm fighting for.

47:18.574 --> 47:20.489
It's love.

47:20.533 --> 47:23.928
Though we have been apart
for what feels like ages,

47:23.971 --> 47:28.846
my love for you remains
ever steadfast, ever true.

47:28.889 --> 47:31.022
Please keep the stories comin, my dear.

47:31.065 --> 47:33.807
Your words inspire me
and bring me hope.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.287
Love, Harris."

47:57.222 --> 47:58.440
So we're gonna keep
half the copies

47:58.484 --> 47:59.920
of these letters here,
take the other half

47:59.964 --> 48:01.617
to the Fire and Ice Festival.

48:01.661 --> 48:03.706
Bring people from there to here.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.056
And here to there.

48:05.099 --> 48:06.274
So they can read
what happens next.

48:06.318 --> 48:07.580
Exactly.

48:07.623 --> 48:09.930
Yeah, I want these letters
to inspire people

48:09.974 --> 48:12.063
and help them reconnect
with the town's history.

48:12.106 --> 48:15.893
Maybe then they'll be less eager
to tear it down.

48:17.633 --> 48:21.072
What're you thinking?

48:21.115 --> 48:25.119
I'm thinking... can you watch
the store for a little while?

48:25.163 --> 48:26.686
Yeah.

48:26.729 --> 48:28.514
Thank you.

48:29.254 --> 48:30.951
Thanks for meeting me.

48:30.995 --> 48:34.912
This used to be your favourite
building in Waterford.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.304
You drew it all the time.

48:36.348 --> 48:38.176
I did it in watercolours, too.

48:38.219 --> 48:40.613
Always reminded me
of someplace grand.

48:40.656 --> 48:42.484
Well, it originally
was a church.

48:42.528 --> 48:45.923
And now it has been repurposed
to be a town hall and a theatre.

48:45.966 --> 48:47.359
Hmm.

48:47.402 --> 48:50.275
You know, you say
you're a hometown boy

48:50.318 --> 48:54.192
but did you actually miss your
home town while you were away?

48:54.235 --> 48:55.933
Honestly?

48:55.976 --> 48:58.413
I've been too busy with work
or looking for the next project

48:58.457 --> 49:00.981
to do much of anything else.

49:01.025 --> 49:04.376
Then let me remind
you what you left behind.

They wrote each other

50:38.948 --> 50:40.515
throughout his time away
in the war

50:40.559 --> 50:44.215
and then when he got back
they bought True Love Books.

50:44.258 --> 50:46.173
Her father originally owned
this building

50:46.217 --> 50:48.088
but Harris loved books so much

50:48.132 --> 50:52.614
he got the entire property
and the rest is...

50:52.658 --> 50:53.789
History.

50:53.833 --> 50:54.834
Mm-hmm.

50:57.141 --> 50:59.752
This is such a special place.

50:59.795 --> 51:03.321
The store, the courtyard,
the tree.

51:03.364 --> 51:05.279
I've always thought so.

51:05.323 --> 51:08.848
And then to find these
valentines from old customers,

51:08.891 --> 51:11.068
I mean, people who went out,
picked out a card,

51:11.111 --> 51:14.158
and wrote in their appreciation
for True Love Books?

51:14.201 --> 51:18.423
It just... it makes it that much
more special.

51:19.728 --> 51:24.559
[phone vibrating]

51:24.603 --> 51:26.605
You can take that
if you want, I can...

51:26.648 --> 51:27.997
Uh, no, no.

51:28.041 --> 51:29.434
Um...

51:33.177 --> 51:37.616
Were you ever tempted to go
to Texas with Matt,

51:37.659 --> 51:39.400
start some place new?

51:39.444 --> 51:41.576
A little.

51:41.620 --> 51:43.143
But I couldn't tell if it was

51:43.187 --> 51:47.147
because of how I felt for him
or if I was just...

51:47.191 --> 51:50.063
Lonely?

51:50.107 --> 51:56.200
Reliving not going to Columbia
with you way back when.

51:56.243 --> 51:59.638
Do you wish you had?

51:59.681 --> 52:03.772
Do you wish you had stayed?

52:03.816 --> 52:05.818
Don't answer that.

52:05.861 --> 52:07.341
Really?

52:07.385 --> 52:10.214
I mean, you didn't stay
and I didn't go

52:10.257 --> 52:15.262
and because of those decisions
we are who we are today.

52:15.306 --> 52:16.698
Well, for what it's worth

52:16.742 --> 52:18.831
I think you turned out
pretty well.

52:18.874 --> 52:21.181
Yeah?

52:21.225 --> 52:22.487
Jury's still out on you.

52:22.530 --> 52:24.010
Oh!

52:24.053 --> 52:25.054

Be cool.

52:48.339 --> 52:49.166
Yeah.

52:49.209 --> 52:50.602
Alright.

52:52.952 --> 52:54.562
Here we go.

52:57.391 --> 52:58.349
Hey, Luce.

52:58.392 --> 52:59.393
Hi.

52:59.437 --> 53:00.525
You said you liked
that Chardonnay

53:00.568 --> 53:02.744
last time you were here.

53:02.788 --> 53:03.876
Unoaked.

53:03.919 --> 53:04.964
You remember.

53:05.007 --> 53:06.574
Yeah, I remember
all sorts of things,

53:06.618 --> 53:09.011
like, uh, the first time
that we met.

53:09.055 --> 53:11.057
August 9th, two years ago.

53:11.100 --> 53:12.885
You'd only been in town
for a week

53:12.928 --> 53:16.932
and you walked in here wearing
a, uh, purple paisley shirt,

53:16.976 --> 53:21.023
ordered a salmon miso,
unoaked Chardonnay.

53:21.067 --> 53:24.070
And I remember
you were hilarious

53:24.113 --> 53:26.464
and dating Megan the model.

53:26.507 --> 53:27.682
Yeah, we broke up.

53:27.726 --> 53:29.858
Yeah. Ten months later.

53:29.902 --> 53:32.339
Sorry! Sorry.

53:32.383 --> 53:34.515
Consults ran late.

53:34.559 --> 53:35.690
Of course.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.562
Hi, Rick.

53:39.259 --> 53:40.304
Uh, I gotta go-

53:40.347 --> 53:42.523
Make some risotto.

53:42.567 --> 53:45.439
Pour some wine.

53:45.483 --> 53:46.962
So...

53:47.006 --> 53:49.269
I'm having that
and it's delicious.

53:49.313 --> 53:51.445
Maybe you shouldn't arrange
any more Valentine's gatherings.

53:51.489 --> 53:54.448
No, not at all.

54:06.895 --> 54:10.247
What if we sent Lucy
a valentine from Rick

54:10.290 --> 54:12.771
telling her how he feels?

54:12.814 --> 54:14.207
And invade his privacy?

54:14.251 --> 54:15.730
Fine, fine, fine.

54:15.774 --> 54:18.124
No scheming, we'll just let him
continue to pine for her

54:18.167 --> 54:21.562
while gently encouraging him
to reveal his feelings.

54:21.606 --> 54:24.130
Well, it is the mature course
of action.

54:24.173 --> 54:25.349
Heading home?

54:25.392 --> 54:26.959
Fire and Ice Festival
starts tomorrow

54:27.002 --> 54:29.353
so this hometown girl's
gotta go get ready.

54:29.396 --> 54:31.398
Well, so does this hometown boy.

54:31.442 --> 54:32.878
Mind a little company
on the walk?

54:32.921 --> 54:33.922
Not at all.

54:33.966 --> 54:35.359
Alright.

54:36.708 --> 54:39.928
So we've talked about my past
and Rick and Lucy

54:39.972 --> 54:41.626
but I couldn't help but notice

54:41.669 --> 54:43.584
we haven't talked
about your love life.

54:43.628 --> 54:46.413
That's because there's not much
to talk about.

54:46.457 --> 54:48.720
So no one?

54:49.895 --> 54:52.637
There was a woman, Sarah.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.203
We came close.

54:54.247 --> 54:56.118
Close as in...?

54:56.162 --> 54:58.643
I thought about proposing.

54:58.686 --> 55:00.209
Wow.

55:00.253 --> 55:04.039
Yeah, well that was about
the same time she met the guy

55:04.083 --> 55:05.476
that was everything
she ever wanted.

55:05.519 --> 55:06.607
Hmm.

55:06.651 --> 55:09.088
And she said it made her
realize that,

55:09.131 --> 55:13.353
in her own words, we were just
kinda going through the motions.

55:13.397 --> 55:14.398
Was she right?

55:14.441 --> 55:16.051
Yeah. Yeah.

55:16.095 --> 55:19.664
I recognized it even
as she was telling me.

55:19.707 --> 55:23.145
I thought about proposing just
because it was a time in my life

55:23.189 --> 55:25.365
where I thought I should.

55:25.409 --> 55:28.760
And Sarah was,
or is I should say,

55:28.803 --> 55:32.372
a wonderful person but we were
only ever just playing

55:32.416 --> 55:35.680
at being a couple instead of

55:35.723 --> 55:39.553
really connecting
like we should.

55:39.597 --> 55:40.641
Are you okay?

55:40.685 --> 55:41.903
Yeah.

55:41.947 --> 55:45.559
Yeah, it hurt my ego
not my heart.

55:45.603 --> 55:48.127
I know the difference.

55:54.046 --> 55:55.395
You live in your parent's house?

55:55.439 --> 55:56.483
Yep.

55:56.527 --> 55:57.919
I bought it six months ago,

55:57.963 --> 56:00.008
right before they left
on their big retirement trip

56:00.052 --> 56:01.662
across the continent.

56:01.706 --> 56:05.362
Oh yeah, Frank and Elaine always
talked about wanting to do that.

56:05.405 --> 56:07.102
Yep, and they did it.

56:07.146 --> 56:08.582
Yeah, I just, I couldn't stand
the thought of

56:08.626 --> 56:10.454
letting this place go.

56:10.497 --> 56:12.194
I'm glad you didn't.

56:12.238 --> 56:14.022
I always loved this place.

56:14.066 --> 56:17.504
Whenever I think about having
a home of my own

56:17.548 --> 56:19.245
it looks like this.

56:19.288 --> 56:20.551
You don't have a house?

56:20.594 --> 56:24.293
A condo, but I'm not there
that much.

56:24.337 --> 56:26.861
I thought a big house was
something you always wanted.

56:26.905 --> 56:29.211
Part of being freelance
is having to take jobs

56:29.255 --> 56:31.823
all over the country
wherever they are.

56:31.866 --> 56:36.088
One of the draws to Ridley is
a chance to stay in one place.

56:36.131 --> 56:38.090
Hmm.

56:39.352 --> 56:41.441
How many times have I walked you
to this door?

56:41.485 --> 56:43.487
[laughs]

56:48.143 --> 56:49.188
Jamie!

56:50.494 --> 56:52.278
Matt?

56:58.066 --> 57:01.505
Uh... Matt, what're you...

57:01.548 --> 57:04.899
I've been trying to reach you
to let you know I was coming.

57:04.943 --> 57:06.597
Um, sorry.

57:06.640 --> 57:10.557
Uh, Matt Van Horn,
this is Sawyer O'Dell.

57:10.601 --> 57:12.385
The Sawyer.

57:12.429 --> 57:16.171
I'm sure there are others
out there.

57:16.215 --> 57:17.434
Right?

57:17.477 --> 57:19.914
Thanks, I'm good.

57:19.958 --> 57:22.439
And thank you
for walking me home.

57:22.482 --> 57:24.005
Yeah.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.531
Hi.

57:31.317 --> 57:32.579
Do you wanna come in?

57:32.623 --> 57:33.493
That'd be great.

57:33.537 --> 57:35.016
Okay.

57:47.855 --> 57:49.422
Thanks.

57:52.251 --> 57:55.210
So what're you doing here, Matt?

57:55.254 --> 57:56.995
You always were direct.

57:57.038 --> 57:58.562
It saves time.

57:58.605 --> 58:00.694
Which I don't have a lot
of right now.

58:00.738 --> 58:02.870
There's a lot going on.

58:02.914 --> 58:04.872
I read your article in the paper
about the bookstore.

58:04.916 --> 58:07.005
You did?

58:07.048 --> 58:11.531
The second I saw your face
in the photo...

58:11.575 --> 58:14.882
I just got hit with the biggest
wave of regret.

58:14.926 --> 58:17.058
I miss you, Jamie.

58:17.102 --> 58:19.583
Just... all of a sudden?

58:19.626 --> 58:21.541
It's always been a struggle.

58:21.585 --> 58:23.151
Hmm.

58:23.195 --> 58:25.414
Are they tearing down
the bookstore?

58:25.458 --> 58:27.025
I don't know.

58:27.068 --> 58:28.983
I hope not.

58:29.027 --> 58:30.681
If it were to close,

58:30.724 --> 58:33.597
would you be open to moving
back to Texas with me?

58:33.640 --> 58:34.728
You could come to Austin.

58:34.772 --> 58:37.514
You could start your own
bookstore there.

58:37.557 --> 58:41.518
Oh, um... Matt.

58:41.561 --> 58:43.650
We had something, Jamie.

58:43.694 --> 58:46.653
I let that get away once.

58:46.697 --> 58:50.439
I'd be a fool not to try again.

No, you absolutely cannot

01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:27.559
Okay.

01:04:27.602 --> 01:04:28.516
Okay.

to hear about that.

the whole time?!

I have.

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:34.669
It's been, uh, buzzing
in my head since I saw you.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:38.891
But it's a no.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:43.374
Matt, I know there's a part
of me that could talk myself

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:48.857

you but it wouldn't be right.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.991

01:06:39.517 --> 01:06:40.822
Hello, Miss Vaughn.

01:06:40.866 --> 01:06:41.867
Well, this is a surprise.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.347
What brings you in?

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.653
I thought I would stop by
on my way to the festival.

01:06:45.697 --> 01:06:46.959
I have to say, Miss Vaughn,

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.570
generating that article
was a deft move.

01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:52.269
and the love letters
are popular, as well.

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:53.705
Thank you.

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:57.056
But by now you must realize
it's a losing battle.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.188
Oh, no.

01:06:58.231 --> 01:06:59.189
Not at all.

01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:01.234
I mean, look around.

01:07:01.278 --> 01:07:03.541
Yes, you're quite busy.

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:05.673
But yours is only one store.

01:07:05.717 --> 01:07:09.416
That's bringing a lot of
foot traffic into the district.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.548
For now.

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.202
But what about
after Valentine's Day,

01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:14.595
when the lure of love goes away?

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:17.859
Oh, the lure of love
never goes away.

01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:19.078

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.949
I suppose not.

01:07:20.993 --> 01:07:24.649
But the emphasis brought on
by this holiday will.

01:07:24.692 --> 01:07:26.999
Valentine's Day is one of
the best days of the year

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.481
and you don't have to be in
a relationship to enjoy it.

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:33.484
But in the end, Waterford's
council is going to vote

01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:36.965
to go forward with Ridley
Property and Sawyer's redesign.

01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:40.447
He's already persuaded three
more stores to support the plan,

01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:45.409
including Keg and Bikes, which
puts us at a tipping point.

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:50.762
Persuade. Right.

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:53.417
I almost forgot
that's why he's here.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.115
Well, that's not the real issue.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:57.073
What is?

01:07:57.116 --> 01:07:58.596
Your future.

01:07:58.639 --> 01:08:03.079
If-when the council decides
to go ahead with the vote

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:05.298
and if you remain a hold-out,

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:06.952
they could evoke eminent domain

01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:09.781
and take your property for
the benefit of the community,

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.783
which means they'll likely pay
a far lower price

01:08:11.826 --> 01:08:14.655
than what we are offering now.

01:08:14.699 --> 01:08:16.787
You have a window
of opportunity, Miss Vaughn,

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:19.138
but it's shrinking.

01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:24.622
This is our final offer.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:26.058
Your store is lovely.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.886
I can see why you're fighting
for it.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:30.106
Perhaps you could use the money

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:34.457
from the sale to recreate
it elsewhere.

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:36.460
It wouldn't be the same.

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:38.026

And I truly am sorry.

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:37.477
What's wrong?

Nothing I didn't already know.

01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:55.234
It was just a timely reminder.

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:56.801
Of?

01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:59.630
Of why you're really here.

and persuade everyone to sell.

Have you just been humouring me
this whole time?

01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:17.169
Or did you ever actually give
Waterford a chance?

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:21.042
My being here is all about
giving Waterford a chance.

my memories about this place

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.401
to score points
but it's not true.

01:10:31.444 --> 01:10:33.751
Waterford is where
the best parts

to Waterford.

01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:36.303
If we just wipe the slate clean
we lose the charm and history

01:17:36.347 --> 01:17:38.436
of what makes Waterford
the kind of place

01:17:38.479 --> 01:17:41.526
that we like to call home.

01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:45.008
After being here for the first
time in a long time

01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:47.880
and several conversations
with the very persuasive

01:17:47.924 --> 01:17:50.317
Miss Jamie Vaughn

01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:52.755
I started thinking about
a new route.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.340
True love.

01:18:13.384 --> 01:18:15.865
[crowd murmurs]

01:18:23.873 --> 01:18:27.311
[Jamie] Oh look, they saved
the tree, the courtyard.

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:35.101
I believe this design
will help foster a sense

01:18:35.145 --> 01:18:39.540
of Waterford's history
and community

01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:43.109
while respecting the past,

01:18:43.153 --> 01:18:48.593
honouring the present,
and planning for the future.

01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:51.814
Thank you, Mr. O'Dell.
Now-

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:55.469
Um... can I say something?

01:18:55.513 --> 01:18:57.341
Please, Miss Vaughn.

01:19:04.391 --> 01:19:06.785
Hi.

01:19:06.829 --> 01:19:13.270
As most of you know I have
been leading the opposition

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:16.099
to the redesign.

01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:22.801
To me there is magic in
the history of this place.

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:26.283
In the Story of Us.

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:33.986
However, that doesn't mean that
we have to sacrifice our future

01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:41.559
and after looking at
Mr. O'Dell's new designs

01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:46.694
I believe he's found a way
to bridge that divide,

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:51.830
for which I am profoundly
grateful.

01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:59.316
So, for what it's worth,
the redesign by Ridley

01:19:59.359 --> 01:20:01.361
has my full support.

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:06.627
[applause]

01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:10.544
Clearly, your support is worth
a great deal, Miss Vaughn.

01:20:10.588 --> 01:20:12.285
Now, if there are
no objections, uh,

01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:15.462
we would like to table the
discussion until next week,

01:20:15.506 --> 01:20:20.728
but just for me, I agree
with Miss Vaughn.

01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:22.121
I like it.

01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:26.560
[applause]

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.356
Sawyer?

01:20:39.399 --> 01:20:41.010
Congratulations.

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:43.577
I feel confident that we will be
welcoming you

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.623
to Ridley Property very soon.

01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:48.104
Thank you, Dana, and
thank you for everything,

01:20:48.147 --> 01:20:50.758
especially all the support
tonight.

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:52.499
But...

01:20:52.543 --> 01:20:54.719
But?

01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:57.461
You said that one of the things
you like about my work

01:20:57.504 --> 01:21:00.507
is my ability to anticipate
a client's needs.

01:21:00.551 --> 01:21:02.379
Which you just demonstrated.

01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:08.994
But I think that it's time for
me to listen to my own needs,

01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:13.042
and I need to make a home,
a real home,

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:16.480
and I would like it to be
in Waterford.

01:21:16.523 --> 01:21:20.571
And you think that prevents you
from working at Ridley?

01:21:20.614 --> 01:21:22.225
Doesn't it?

01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:24.705
Sawyer, you just pulled off
a tremendous success

01:21:24.749 --> 01:21:27.795
that goes far beyond your talent
for architecture.

01:21:27.839 --> 01:21:30.624
I'm not letting you go
that easily.

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:32.583
You want to be in Waterford,
fine.

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:33.932
You have to be here

01:21:33.976 --> 01:21:35.586
while the project goes forward,
anyway.

01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:38.502
Afterward, we'll negotiate.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:44.987
And I anticipate that it will go
very well for both of us.

01:21:54.126 --> 01:21:56.085
Where's Jamie?

01:21:56.128 --> 01:21:57.825
Mm.

01:21:57.869 --> 01:21:59.131
She's not here.

01:21:59.175 --> 01:22:00.741
[chuckles]

01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:02.178
Okay, where is she?

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:04.571
Oh, she told me to give
you this.

01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:06.182
What's this?

01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:08.749
It's a red envelope
on Valentine's Day.

01:22:08.793 --> 01:22:10.926
It's a valentine.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.641
Have fun.

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:48.719
So I started writing
something new.

01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:51.896
A love story.

01:23:51.939 --> 01:23:55.247
And I would like
your opinion on it.

01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:57.206
What's it about?

01:23:57.249 --> 01:24:02.907
Well, a boy and a girl meet,
fall in love,

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.171
then they get separated only
to have circumstance

01:24:06.215 --> 01:24:10.871
bring them back together again.

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:15.267
And they realize they never
stopped loving each other

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.574
the entire time.

01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:21.795
And that's how you know
it's true love.

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:26.452
That's my favourite
kind of story.

01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:28.976
Mine too.

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:33.285
But I'm gonna need your help
to finish it.

01:24:33.329 --> 01:24:35.896
And you will have it.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.159
Always.
