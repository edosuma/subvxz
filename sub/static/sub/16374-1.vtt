01:32.993 --> 01:33.993
- One bag.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.832
One cell phone.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.567
One library book.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.140
- Good luck out there.

02:21.407 --> 02:22.474
- Hey!

02:23.977 --> 02:30.983
- Hey!

03:06.920 --> 03:10.155
- Hey, listen.

03:10.157 --> 03:14.293
There's something I have to
tell you.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.249
Everything's the same.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.685
Just how you left it.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.654
- Thanks.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.189
- All right, well, you got
fresh sheets,

03:44.191 --> 03:46.124
a couple new pillows.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.293
They got foam in 'em, all right?

03:48.295 --> 03:52.431
Makes you sleep better or
something.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.343
She's a lot different
than she was

04:04.345 --> 04:05.577
when you guys
were in high school.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.346
You'll see.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.480
- Robin.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.983
- I love her.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.017
You're my sister.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.887
Could you at least try?

04:19.892 --> 04:23.528
All right, well...

04:23.530 --> 04:27.032
You let me know if you need
anything else, all right?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.502
- Good night.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.937
- Good night.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.663
Goddammit.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.589
Hey.

05:24.591 --> 05:25.424
Ladies.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.158
- Hey.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.060
- You guys going to the bar?

05:28.062 --> 05:29.361
Yeah.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.729
I just wanted to say hi.
- Hi.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.697
- Hey, Robin.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.731
How you doin'?

05:32.733 --> 05:33.632
- Hey.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.168
Um, I'm good.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.471
- Come get one drink with us.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.939
Come on.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.507
- I want to. I do.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.645
But it's her first night home.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.447
- I understand.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.282
- Hey.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.084
Listen, can I talk to you for
a second?

05:52.086 --> 05:53.251
I'm only gonna borrow her for
a minute.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.519
- One minute.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.329
This should be interesting.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.731
- What?

06:05.733 --> 06:09.334
- Rosemary and jae.

06:09.336 --> 06:12.838
- You mean that stupid
shit from high school?

06:12.840 --> 06:16.308
- Rosemary flirted with
her dad like every day.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.810
- Everyone flirted with her dad.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.346
He was like the only
hot teacher in school.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.848
- No. Mm-mm.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.683
I don't do older guys.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.017
- Well, I think
the whole town knows

06:26.019 --> 06:27.719
that you like 'em young.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.623
- That's very true.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.427
Hmm.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.962
- We shouldn't be talking
about this here.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.198
It's not good.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.537
- Guess what.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.639
- Hmm?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.742
- Told her about us.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.777
I know, I know, I should have
done it

06:51.779 --> 06:53.245
a long time ago.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.980
I just wanted the moment to be
right

06:54.982 --> 06:57.716
and it never was, and
anyway, it doesn't matter.

06:57.718 --> 07:02.788
She knows now,
and it's gonna be good.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.291
You going to the festival this
weekend?

07:06.293 --> 07:07.259
- Yeah.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.661
Yeah, it'll take my mind off
things.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.896
- Yeah?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.831
- Yeah, like the fact that

07:12.833 --> 07:13.565
you're supposed to be there
with me.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.802
- Sorry.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.104
- It's just difficult.

07:19.106 --> 07:23.175
- Yeah, well, it is gonna
be difficult for me, too.

07:23.177 --> 07:26.478
You know what I mean?

07:26.480 --> 07:28.647
- Yeah, I got it.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.592
- Hey.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.560
- Hey.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.995
- You want some coffee?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.264
- Sure.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.799
- Come on.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.968
I'm makin' some breakfast.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.505
- Yeah, I'll be right down.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.774
- I know you like it crispy.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.342
Hope that's crispy enough for
you.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.644
- It's incredible.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.347
It's better than that prison
food.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.222
So what's burn the moon?

08:10.224 --> 08:10.922
- What?

08:10.924 --> 08:11.857
How did...

08:11.859 --> 08:13.525
How did you hear about that?

08:13.527 --> 08:16.495
- It's on your calendar.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.330
- Oh, yeah.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.231
Right.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.999
Well, it's

08:21.001 --> 08:21.700
this thing I was gonna
do this weekend, but...

08:21.702 --> 08:23.468
- Robin.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.470
- I'm canceling it, I'm
not leaving you alone.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.439
- Go! I've got plenty
to do around here.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.780
Okay, no, I don't, but...

08:35.782 --> 08:37.349
What is it?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.385
- Well, it's this spiritual
music festival

08:40.386 --> 08:42.453
in the desert with a bunch of
hippies.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.422
It's stupid, I know, but
Rosemary wanted to go.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.695
- Sounds pretty cool.

08:50.697 --> 08:55.367
- Really, because that sounds
like something you'd hate.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.736
- I wanna go.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.603
- Really?

08:58.605 --> 09:00.739
- Yeah.

09:00.741 --> 09:04.175
Yeah, it's way too fuckin'
weird being around here anyway.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.076
- Yeah.

09:05.078 --> 09:09.748
Why not. Let's do it.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.649
Hey, you...

09:10.651 --> 09:11.650
You want some more oj?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.152
- Sure.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.057
- Goin' to burn the moon!

09:43.383 --> 09:45.350
- You ready? Smile.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.184
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.586
Hold on.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.223
- Let me see it.

09:52.225 --> 09:52.991
It's not the nice one.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.126
I can't show you.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
- I mean, have you seen this?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.805
- That's not a surprise.

10:17.217 --> 10:23.488
I'll meet you by the waterside

10:23.490 --> 10:24.522
- Well, how much longer?

10:24.524 --> 10:26.291
Because I lost service.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.159
- I think we all lost service.

10:28.161 --> 10:31.763
- Okay, we stay on
the 14 for another 23 miles

10:31.765 --> 10:33.005
until we hit death valley road.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.933
- What was that?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.534
- Uh, not sure.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.773
Whoa.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.576
- Okay, now, what was that?

10:44.578 --> 10:45.944
- Okay. Okay.

10:45.946 --> 10:50.115
Everybody hold tight.
I'm gonna pull over.

10:58.924 --> 10:59.924
Oh, god.

10:59.926 --> 11:00.825
Oh, that's not good.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.626
- What happened?

11:01.628 --> 11:03.862
- I don't know.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.498
Where's your stick?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.366
- Oh, my god.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.908
- Are you sure you put
oil in it?

11:16.910 --> 11:17.842
Is there oil?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.244
- I don't know.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.745
Shit, what are we gonna do?

11:20.747 --> 11:21.579
- Call triple a.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.314
We'll call triple a.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.149
- No one has service.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.884
How can we call triple a?

11:25.886 --> 11:26.718
- Oh, hey, look at this.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.619
Hey. Hey!

11:27.621 --> 11:29.521
Hey.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.603
- Y'all havin' some car trouble?

11:45.605 --> 11:46.471
- Hi there.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.806
Yeah, we are.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.973
- Yeah, it's a hell of place
to get stuck

11:48.975 --> 11:50.809
out here in the desert.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.977
Lot of stuff out there that
can eat ya.

11:52.979 --> 11:53.945
- Yeah.

11:53.947 --> 11:54.946
- Can I give you a hand?

11:54.948 --> 11:55.780
- Please do, yeah.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.549
- Whoa.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.650
He looks like something
out of deliverance.

11:58.652 --> 12:00.785
- Don't be a bitch, Jasmine.

12:00.787 --> 12:01.753
- Oh, these new cars.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.687
You need a computer to know

12:02.689 --> 12:04.155
what the hell's going on.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.224
Why don't I give you a tow.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.826
- Really, that would
be so great.

12:07.828 --> 12:08.793
That would be so great.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.662
Thank you so much.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.563
- Thank you so much.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.597
- You almost made it.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.898
- Almost made it.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.500
- Where are you folks headed?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.902
- We're going to a music
festival.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.970
- Burn the moon?

12:18.972 --> 12:20.505
- Yeah.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.074
- Yeah, I heard of it.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.443
Ball's droppin'.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.212
- Yeah.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.080
- I wouldn't get caught drivin'

12:29.082 --> 12:30.582
into death valley at nightfall.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.450
Be careful.

12:32.452 --> 12:37.355
Have fun.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.132
- Whoa.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.701
What's wrong with your baby?

12:49.703 --> 12:53.071
What, have you got four of 'em?

12:53.073 --> 12:53.972
- Yeah, I...

12:53.974 --> 12:55.740
You know, I don't know.

12:55.742 --> 12:56.875
It was like, making like
a rattling sound, right?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.209
And then it started to smoke.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.246
- Well, let's take a look.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.648
Are you guys going to
a concert or something?

13:03.650 --> 13:05.383
- Yeah.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.584
- You like that crazy rock
music?

13:06.586 --> 13:08.586
- Sorta.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.354
- What do you
think, she's runnin' hot?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.054
- I...

13:10.056 --> 13:10.955
Could be.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.524
- I'm here to tell you,

13:12.526 --> 13:15.059
she's hot tonight.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.528
- Don't pay any attention to
him.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.962
He's a good mechanic.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.632
Archer's got you covered from
here on out.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.033
- Hey, man, thank you again.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.101
Really appreciate you stopping.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.769
- Don't mention it, don't
mention it.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.504
Just pay it forward, all right?

13:26.506 --> 13:29.507
Pay it forward.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.051
Oh!

13:40.053 --> 13:41.252
Wow, that's...

13:41.254 --> 13:43.521
Wow, that's mighty generous of
you.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.323
- Okay.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.525
- There's a bar, restaurant
over here

13:47.527 --> 13:48.927
you guys can hang out at
while he gets you fixed up.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.895
- Sounds good, man.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.297
Thanks again, thank you very
much.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.398
- Good luck to you.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.300
- You, too.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.741
Could you go to the bar with
them,

14:03.743 --> 14:06.778
just make sure she's okay?

14:11.817 --> 14:12.851
So what are we lookin' at
here, man?

14:12.853 --> 14:14.018
- I hate to break it to you.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.688
It's gonna run you about six
bucks.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.488
- That's it, really?

14:17.490 --> 14:18.223
Six bucks?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.091
That's nothing, I can do that.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.793
- No.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.695
Just joking.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.829
- That's really funny.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.835
- Ugh.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.203
- Wow, you know you're really

14:32.205 --> 14:34.105
in the middle of nowhere

14:34.107 --> 14:36.074
when people are smoking in bars.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.845
- I don't know, I just need a
drink.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.247
Excuse me?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.816
Hi. Could I have a vodka soda,
please?

14:44.818 --> 14:46.251
- It's your happy hour.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.153
Bud, bud light, rum.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.722
- Okay.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.357
- All right, well, let's
just get bud lights.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.691
Three bud lights, please.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.794
- Really?

14:57.663 --> 15:00.164
- Welcome to the last chance
bar.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.866
What can I do for you?

15:01.868 --> 15:03.301
- Dark and stormy.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.303
- "Dark and stormy."

15:05.305 --> 15:06.471
That's my lady.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.405
- I need some water soon

15:07.407 --> 15:09.340
in my eyes or something.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.342
- Dark and stormy,

15:11.344 --> 15:15.780
I love the dark and stormy.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.885
Dark and stormy.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.887
Dark and stormy.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.291
- That's a fairly erotic
order you got there.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.258
- Why is that?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.526
- You know.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.695
Being in the desert and all.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.963
Rain.

15:33.867 --> 15:38.036
There isn't any.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.943
I just think you girls are way
too pretty

15:44.945 --> 15:49.948
to be in a shithole rat trap
like this.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.050
- Sorry, is my friend
bothering you?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.484
- Come on, don't do that.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.820
- No, you're a little rusty,
buddy.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.823
Fine.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.859
- Aw, shit.

16:02.895 --> 16:03.628
So...

16:03.630 --> 16:04.495
- Hey, Dax.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.597
- We're down from Reno.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.366
We're going into the desert
for a music festival.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.168
I'm Troy.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.936
- Jae.

16:11.938 --> 16:12.937
We're doing the same thing,
actually.

16:12.939 --> 16:12.937
- Really?

16:12.939 --> 16:15.306
- Yeah, well, we're trying to.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.975
We're having some car trouble.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.043
- I'm sorry.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.589
So, the mechanic said that, uh,

16:31.591 --> 16:32.924
we blew a goddamn head gasket

16:32.926 --> 16:34.325
and it's gonna take two days
to fix.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.393
- Two days?

16:35.395 --> 16:36.661
- Yeah, so what I'm thinking is,

16:36.663 --> 16:37.996
I'm going to call someone
to pick you guys up,

16:37.998 --> 16:39.864
take you back.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.165
I'll stay here with Rosemary
and we'll just get a...

16:41.167 --> 16:42.166
- Robin.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.302
- Hotel and drive back.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.703
- Excuse me, guys.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.607
We're in an rv, and we
got plenty of room, so

16:49.609 --> 16:51.576
if you'd like, you can tag
along.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.444
- That's very nice of you,
thank you,

16:53.446 --> 16:54.345
but I don't think that's a
good idea.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.780
- Well, why not?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.348
It's better than waiting it
out here.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.449
- And the festival's two days.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.585
Your car will be fixed in two
days,

17:00.587 --> 17:03.321
and then we'll drop you right
back here.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.556
I mean, if you like.

17:05.558 --> 17:09.594
It's just a friendly offer.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.396
- We don't have too many
options.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.872
- They just don't make
girls like that in Reno.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.340
- No.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.009
- What are you doing?

17:25.011 --> 17:25.910
- What?

17:25.912 --> 17:28.079
I'm just hot.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.914
- He's like 12.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.150
- He's 24. I asked.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.285
And engaged.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.288
I'm going to seduce him.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.856
- You're sick in the head.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.725
- So?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.627
- It'll be dark in an hour.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.961
- Yeah, that's okay.

17:43.963 --> 17:47.799
I mean, we're almost done.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.667
40 minutes.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.670
It's pretty much a
straight shot from here.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.439
Don't you worry, blue eyes.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.893
- Are you excited to go to the
festival?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.328
- Honestly, I have no idea.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.729
I'm hoping it's gonna be good.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.465
- I mean, I'm in the same
exact thing.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.266
- Heard a lot of good things.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.902
- It just looks too beautiful
to be dangerous out there.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.471
- Yeah, I know, right?

18:26.473 --> 18:30.842
But, see, I grew up in
tehachapi and I can tell ya...

18:30.844 --> 18:33.344
People pretty much die in
death valley

18:33.346 --> 18:34.645
almost every year.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.482
No, it's true.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.950
I remember this one married
couple,

18:38.952 --> 18:40.585
they came out, you know,

18:40.587 --> 18:41.786
to go see the race track,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.654
and they bring their baby
daughter.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.456
Like, the area by the
race track, there's like,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.991
it's all dirt roads.

18:46.993 --> 18:51.762
So there's no cell reception
to speak of.

18:51.764 --> 18:56.601
They made a wrong turn I
think at teakettle junction,

18:56.603 --> 18:58.069
but they didn't bring enough
water.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.138
I think they lasted about
three days.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.873
- What the fuck.

19:01.875 --> 19:02.840
- If I'm remembering correctly.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.175
The parents went to get help,

19:04.177 --> 19:07.145
and the baby died right in the
back seat.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.247
- Dude, we're going out to
the middle of fucking nowhere.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.482
I really don't need to hear
about babies dying, dude.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.784
- I'm sorry, I just...

19:13.786 --> 19:15.920
- Man, that
is so fuckin' creepy.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.755
- Hey, what do you guys
wanna play?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.490
Hey, oh, oh, oh, go fish.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.858
I know how to play that one.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.160
- How about fuck the dealer?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.594
- I like the sound of that.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.562
I like the sound of that better.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.563
- What, fuck the dealer?
- Yeah.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.732
- You're dealing, right?

19:27.734 --> 19:28.833
- Yeah, let's play fuck
the dealer.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.700
- Fuck the dealer.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.602
- Sounds good to me.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.271
- Let's do it, all right.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.106
- How do you play fuck
the dealer?

19:35.108 --> 19:37.008
- There you go, there you go.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.876
- I don't know,
but I wanna play now.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.511
- I guess a
number, you say high or low.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.913
- I'm not gonna say anything.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.551
- I was just a kid, jae.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.054
I didn't know.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.090
I was so...

19:53.092 --> 19:54.258
So stupid, and...

19:54.260 --> 19:56.994
- yeah. You were.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.635
- Robin missed you so much.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.440
If you ever wanna talk...

20:09.442 --> 20:12.677
- I don't.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.512
- Okay.

20:19.451 --> 20:23.054
Thank you.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.156
- Oh, man,
I'm ready to get there.

20:25.158 --> 20:25.856
- Are you?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.758
- Yes.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.493
- I'll get you there.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.462
- Burning moon.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.932
- Where'd
you get this stuff from?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.200
- Some guy, well...

20:36.202 --> 20:37.368
I was about to give you his
name,

20:37.370 --> 20:39.670
but he's kinda paranoid.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.273
Did a pretty good job grinding
this.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.107
- All right.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.076
Pack it up.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.777
- That's what I
keep you around for, right?

20:46.779 --> 20:47.878
That and the fact that you
bring...

20:47.880 --> 20:48.879
- Treats for everyone.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.781
- You know what, you guys?

20:50.783 --> 20:51.716
I honestly feel like I am
driving

20:51.718 --> 20:53.884
a narcotic mobile playpen.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.752
- Just keep driving.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.120
- I'm a bit high.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.155
- Am I making you uncomfortable?

20:58.157 --> 21:00.258
- That tastes like oregano.

21:00.260 --> 21:00.992
- It's weed.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.960
- Oh, that stuff's horrible.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.061
- It's the same guy
he got the peyote from.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.763
- Did you say peyote?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.031
- I mighta said peyote.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.232
- That sounds like a fucking
great time.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.767
Where's that?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.202
Yeah, how's that taste?

21:11.204 --> 21:13.070
Not so good.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.372
- For fuck's sake, you
smoke any more fuckin' weed,

21:14.374 --> 21:16.340
and I'm gonna honestly be able

21:16.342 --> 21:19.243
to fucking cut a hole with a
pair of scissors in the smoke.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.344
- I'm starting to like you.

21:20.346 --> 21:21.879
- Screw you guys.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.581
- This isn't looking much like
a road.

21:23.583 --> 21:27.952
- This is gettin' a little
intense here.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.954
- Good for you.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.124
- Here is to a wonderful
weekend at burning...

21:33.826 --> 21:36.427
- Whoa!

21:36.429 --> 21:37.328
- What the fuck?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.063
- Oh, Jesus, what was that?

21:39.065 --> 21:40.698
- You just spilled shit all
over this.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.599
- All right, just...

21:41.601 --> 21:43.267
These fucking dirt roads.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.268
I'm gonna go out and check the
damage.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.403
- Are we stuck?

21:45.405 --> 21:46.737
- He'll deal with it.

21:46.739 --> 21:47.638
- I still got an Ace.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.341
Is that good?

21:51.376 --> 21:52.677
- Oh. Not good.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.745
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

21:54.747 --> 21:55.646
- What the fuck.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.148
This is fucking great.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.549
- Oh, that's very profound.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.318
You know what?

22:00.320 --> 22:01.952
Just keep walking and
let us figure this out.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.454
- This doesn't
even look like a road.

22:03.456 --> 22:03.454
- It's hard to see.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.589
I mean, it looked like a road.

22:05.591 --> 22:06.724
- Okay.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.860
So we should be

22:09.862 --> 22:10.728
right about here.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.163
You see this?

22:12.165 --> 22:13.698
And we're trying to get to
furnace creek,

22:13.700 --> 22:16.334
and that's only about
10 miles or so this way,

22:16.336 --> 22:17.768
so no big deal.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.470
- There's so many stars.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.372
- Oh, my god.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.807
You are such a fucking hippie.

22:22.809 --> 22:23.641
- Well, why are we following
this?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.576
- What do you mean?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.611
- This says it's for 4x4
vehicles only.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.714
- If the rv's stuck,

22:29.716 --> 22:30.581
why don't we just camp
out here for the night.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.450
- Yeah, you're probably right.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.618
I mean, I don't think we can
continue until the morning.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.520
It's not gonna be safe, so...

22:36.522 --> 22:38.556
- And...

22:38.558 --> 22:39.657
I have peyote.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.958
- If you say peyote one more
time...

22:40.960 --> 22:42.259
- well, I said it.

22:42.261 --> 22:46.130
- I will kill you.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.467
- So what's up with your friend?

22:49.469 --> 22:51.302
- He's been
trying to find himself

22:51.304 --> 22:53.938
since his wife left him.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.707
- We're really in the middle
of nowhere.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.008
- Yeah.

22:58.010 --> 22:58.876
Nowhere.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.044
It's beautiful.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.213
Man, look at these stars, huh?

23:02.215 --> 23:03.314
- Yeah.

23:03.316 --> 23:04.048
- Here.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.350
- I think the soup is ready.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.685
Anyone want?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.420
- Well, what does it do?

23:09.422 --> 23:10.621
- It's called peyote.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.623
Well.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.659
I think it's maybe the most
beautiful trip

23:15.661 --> 23:16.894
you've ever been on.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.829
You're gonna drink it,

23:18.831 --> 23:21.465
you're just gonna kinda glide
away.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.401
You're gonna walk over,

23:23.403 --> 23:24.702
I don't know,

23:24.704 --> 23:27.838
Bridges made of galaxies.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.707
Everything just kind of feels
like,

23:29.709 --> 23:30.674
excuse me for saying it,

23:30.676 --> 23:32.309
like an orgasm.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.210
- Whoa.

23:33.212 --> 23:33.911
- Put it this way.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.046
Last time I did it,

23:36.048 --> 23:39.016
my ex-girlfriend's dead cat
Andre came back to visit me.

23:39.018 --> 23:43.754
And he just, like, his colors
exploded.

23:43.756 --> 23:48.659
You know, like a rainbow
or something, and...

23:48.661 --> 23:53.731
I could see his soul inside my
own head.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.366
I didn't meow or anything like
that.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.601
That's not what I'm saying.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.736
- Okay.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.740
- I'm just saying it was...

24:02.742 --> 24:05.242
It was a spiritual experience.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.644
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:06.646 --> 24:07.812
The first and last time you
did it,

24:07.814 --> 24:09.814
meaning three days ago at work?

24:09.816 --> 24:10.748
- The fucker got fired!

24:10.750 --> 24:11.649
- No, I...

24:11.651 --> 24:13.317
Okay, that was acid,

24:13.319 --> 24:14.919
and I quit.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.420
- You mutually parted ways.

24:16.422 --> 24:17.621
- We mutually parted ways.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.090
It was very amicable.

24:20.092 --> 24:20.958
I think.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.927
- You got the can.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.395
- I hope he writes me a
referral.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.299
Fuck it, I'm gonna drink some
of this.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.533
- I'll try some.

24:29.535 --> 24:30.701
- Jae.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.635
Jae.

24:31.637 --> 24:32.436
- Here you go.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.370
- What?

24:33.372 --> 24:35.206
I said I'll try some.

24:35.208 --> 24:38.042
- Here.

24:38.044 --> 24:42.079
- Two years in prison
and now she's a badass.

24:45.817 --> 24:49.119
Fuckin' creepy.

24:52.457 --> 24:55.392
- What was that?

24:59.397 --> 25:00.264
You said something.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.265
What did you say?

25:01.267 --> 25:01.932
- Jae, just...

25:01.934 --> 25:03.000
Just let it go.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.802
- I said you're fuckin' creepy.

25:04.804 --> 25:08.205
- Jasmine.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.275
- I'm going for a walk.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.676
- Jae.

25:12.678 --> 25:13.577
- Fuck.

25:13.579 --> 25:14.445
- You know what?

25:14.447 --> 25:16.313
Now wait, I'll go with you.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.748
Jae!

25:17.750 --> 25:21.318
Hey, jae, don't go far.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.052
- Great.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.387
That was Great.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.288
Thank you.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.724
- I know. I'm sorry.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.796
- So are we gonna drink that
peyote?

25:32.798 --> 25:34.465
- Are you gonna try it?

25:34.467 --> 25:38.035
- Are you, seriously?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.904
- Ugh, it tastes disgusting.

25:39.906 --> 25:40.838
- No, it doesn't.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.008
- It's disgusting.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.976
- There you go.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.711
- Okay, it's disgusting,
but you're gonna love it.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.646
- Now we're having fun.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.446
Come on.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.283
- Are you sure?

25:52.285 --> 25:54.318
- Bottoms up.

26:04.195 --> 26:06.764
- Do you feel anything?

26:06.766 --> 26:09.567
- Not yet.

26:19.811 --> 26:22.446
- Wow.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.316
- What?

26:25.318 --> 26:28.085
- Look at the stars.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.755
- Yup, they're there.

26:32.791 --> 26:36.393
When is this gonna kick in?

26:36.395 --> 26:39.630
Some crazy shit in this world.

26:39.632 --> 26:40.364
If you think about it,

26:40.366 --> 26:42.733
if a raccoon changed color,

26:42.735 --> 26:44.401
like a red ginger,

26:44.403 --> 26:48.272
it'd be like that red panda
that they got in the zoo.

26:48.274 --> 26:52.042
I'd want a red panda for a pet.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.245
I'd feed him cheetos.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.748
So, stars are supposed to be
kind of

26:57.750 --> 26:59.750
balls of dying light, right?

26:59.752 --> 27:01.685
But what if it works this way?

27:01.687 --> 27:04.688
That actually the sky is
like a big, black dome,

27:04.690 --> 27:08.492
and the stars are like
little pinprick holes in it

27:08.494 --> 27:12.396
that's kind of god's
light shootin' through it.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.597
That would be pretty cool.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.899
I don't think I'd want
to go in a black hole.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.301
It would hurt.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.003
I'd go in a wormhole, though,

27:19.005 --> 27:22.773
because then I could go to the
other side of the universe.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.075
You know who I wanna meet?

27:25.077 --> 27:26.810
The little guy from, in south
America,

27:26.812 --> 27:29.246
the first guy that figured
out that it was a good idea

27:29.248 --> 27:32.316
to put frog poison on an arrow.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.653
It would be pretty crazy
to live in a rainforest.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.504
- You guys know who Van goge is?

27:53.506 --> 27:54.571
- Who?

27:54.573 --> 27:55.239
- Van gogh.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.241
- Who's Van goge?

28:00.279 --> 28:01.612
- He's fuckin' awesome.

28:01.614 --> 28:02.279
- Is he?

28:02.281 --> 28:03.281
- Mm-hmm.

28:04.617 --> 28:05.783
- He only has one ear.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.017
- What?

28:07.019 --> 28:08.018
- One ear.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.553
- I can see the wind.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.288
- Huh?

28:11.290 --> 28:14.191
- You heard what I said.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.226
What's the matter with you?

28:16.228 --> 28:19.997
- I think the stars are on fire.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.039
- Wade.

28:29.041 --> 28:29.907
- Yeah?

28:29.909 --> 28:30.741
- Wade?

28:30.743 --> 28:32.242
- Yeah.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.144
- You gotta stop

28:34.146 --> 28:36.213
walking around on my head, man.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.315
- Stop, Wade.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.085
- Stop walking
around on my head, maaaaan.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.689
- Oh, my god.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.791
- Oh, I don't know.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.060
- On that note.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.530
- What are you talking about?

28:53.532 --> 28:57.768
- I want to have children with
you.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.604
- Robin.

29:00.606 --> 29:03.440
- I do.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.576
I do.

29:05.578 --> 29:13.183
You're the most beautiful and
pure thing I have ever seen.

29:13.185 --> 29:17.488
You're perfect.

29:18.289 --> 29:21.792
- I'm not perfect.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.661
- Yeah, you are.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.463
And I wanna marry you,

29:26.465 --> 29:29.333
and I wanna have little babies
with you,

29:29.335 --> 29:32.469
like jae, you know, when
she was still small.

29:32.471 --> 29:36.974
So cute.

29:36.976 --> 29:40.511
That was before mom got sick.

29:40.513 --> 29:44.815
- Yeah.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.083
- I mean, she still hasn't ever

29:46.085 --> 29:47.017
told me what really happened.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.318
I guess she just...

29:48.320 --> 29:51.455
Won't open up to me.

29:51.457 --> 29:55.092
I mean, she's my sister.

29:55.094 --> 30:02.533
I just feel like I failed.

30:02.535 --> 30:05.135
But I think she's warming up
to you.

30:07.273 --> 30:10.107
Can you feel it?

30:10.109 --> 30:15.012
- I guess, yeah.

30:19.518 --> 30:25.455
- You're familiar to me.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.058
I know you.

30:32.598 --> 30:35.933
You are very, very beautiful.

30:39.270 --> 30:44.308
May I kiss you?

30:44.310 --> 30:45.976
- I...

30:45.978 --> 30:47.044
Troy.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.485
- Oh.

31:28.487 --> 31:29.887
I feel sick.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.493
- Hello, what's this?

32:43.495 --> 32:46.797
Aw. Oh, shit.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.900
But what a glorious morning,
Vietnam!

32:49.902 --> 32:51.234
Ah!

32:51.236 --> 32:53.403
Oh.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.205
Groovy Wade.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.140
And you, Heather.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.041
How are you doing?

32:58.043 --> 32:59.843
- Good.

32:59.845 --> 33:00.811
- Coffee?

33:00.813 --> 33:01.845
- Sure.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.247
- You know we have
coffee in the rv, right?

33:04.249 --> 33:05.582
- Oh, that didn't work.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.017
- What? Why not?

33:07.019 --> 33:11.054
- Well, I guess it just
wouldn't turn on.

33:11.056 --> 33:11.822
- Hey, good morning, guys.

33:11.824 --> 33:12.856
- It's the coffee in the pot.

33:12.858 --> 33:13.657
- Morning.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.258
- Anybody seen jae?

33:15.260 --> 33:17.227
- Uh...

33:17.229 --> 33:19.162
Yeah.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.899
Last I saw her, I think she
was out by rocks with Troy.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.111
- Jae!

33:41.586 --> 33:46.089
Jae!

33:50.229 --> 33:52.429
- Troy.

33:52.431 --> 33:53.697
- What?

33:53.699 --> 33:55.365
- Where are we?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.434
- Wow.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.670
Amazing.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.606
- Jae!

34:02.608 --> 34:03.473
- Shit!

34:03.475 --> 34:05.008
- Oh, boy.

34:05.010 --> 34:07.244
Well, last night was amazing,
huh?

34:07.246 --> 34:08.678
- Yeah.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.246
Okay, we gotta get back down
there.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.581
- What, you're gonna leave me
like this?

34:11.583 --> 34:12.849
- Yeah.

34:12.851 --> 34:17.621
- You don't wanna do it again?

34:17.623 --> 34:18.688
- Jae!

34:26.230 --> 34:28.098
- Hey!

34:28.100 --> 34:30.801
- Oh, hey!

34:34.138 --> 34:34.871
Oh.
- Hey.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.039
- What are you doing?

34:36.041 --> 34:37.841
- Sorry.

34:37.842 --> 34:38.975
- You can't just wander
off like that, okay?

34:38.976 --> 34:41.210
You scared the shit out of me.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.212
- Okay.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.080
- You okay?

34:43.081 --> 34:43.980
- Yeah.

34:43.982 --> 34:44.681
- Yeah?

34:44.683 --> 34:48.685
- Yeah.

34:48.687 --> 34:53.623
- 'Sup?

34:53.625 --> 34:54.491
- I got it.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.992
Don't talk, I got it.

34:55.994 --> 34:58.195
I got it, I got it, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.162
- It doesn't look like
you got it.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.997
- Ah, ah, ah.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.132
- Is it turning?
- Try it now.

35:02.134 --> 35:02.799
- No. No.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.534
Nothing is happening.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.570
- Fuck.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.138
Didn't I turn on the lights
last night

35:08.140 --> 35:11.074
to see shapes in the
fucking rock or something?

35:14.812 --> 35:15.846
- Yes, we...

35:15.848 --> 35:16.980
- Fucking...
- We did that.

35:16.982 --> 35:20.617
- We totally fucking did that.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.620
Fuck.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.021
- Just don't tell anyone.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.991
- I'm not gonna tell anyone
if you don't tell anyone.

35:27.993 --> 35:31.027
- Knock yourself out.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.796
Calm down.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.165
- By the way, Wade's got a
great ass.

35:35.167 --> 35:35.866
I mean...

35:35.868 --> 35:37.834
- I'm out of ideas.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.169
- Yeah, let's get some more
ideas over a beer, huh?

35:39.171 --> 35:39.836
I'm thirsty.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.838
Fuck this shit.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.707
Oh, I shoulda never came here.

35:43.709 --> 35:44.841
Fuckin' desert.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.744
I shoulda stayed at home.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.846
- Well, this is spiffy.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.368
- Here, one more time, let me
try this.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.986
Goddammit.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.087
All right, look, the battery
is dead

35:57.089 --> 35:58.722
and it's not coming back to
life,

35:58.724 --> 36:01.191
so that's real, that's swell.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.959
- I'm sorry that this is
turning out to be such a

36:02.961 --> 36:04.628
shitty fuckin' weekend.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.629
- No, it's okay.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.997
Hey, we'll find a solution.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.999
- Oh, we'll find a solution.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.767
Yeah, the solution is
we're gonna have to walk

36:10.769 --> 36:12.569
all the way back to that road.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.337
- Well, it's only 10 miles
from here.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.672
That's not such a bad walk.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.140
- Did you just say fucking 10
miles?

36:17.142 --> 36:19.576
I have heels on.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.344
- Dry bone canyon.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.913
Sounds like a gay bar.

36:22.915 --> 36:25.815
All right, I'm gonna go wake up

36:25.817 --> 36:28.852
Rosemary.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.253
Baby.

36:30.255 --> 36:35.192
Sleepyhead.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.628
Hey. Baby.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.597
You wanna wake up?

36:40.599 --> 36:44.334
Rosie.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.336
Rosie?

36:49.741 --> 36:52.275
Jae! Jae!

36:52.277 --> 36:53.310
Jae.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.444
God.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.513
- What?

36:56.515 --> 36:59.449
Robin, what?

36:59.451 --> 37:03.053
- I think she's dead.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.256
- Oh, shit.

37:06.258 --> 37:09.059
- She's not dead. She's
sleeping.

37:09.061 --> 37:09.826
Right?

37:09.828 --> 37:11.995
- Maybe she overdosed?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.863
- Is she fuckin' dead?

37:13.865 --> 37:18.535
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

37:18.537 --> 37:23.440
Are you fuckin' sure?

37:30.314 --> 37:33.984
- How the fuck did this even
happen?

37:33.986 --> 37:35.151
- Could she have od'd?

37:35.153 --> 37:36.186
- No.

37:36.188 --> 37:37.954
- Od'd?

37:37.956 --> 37:39.756
- Look, you can't od from
peyote.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.590
- That's right.
- Yeah, you can.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.458
Yes, yes.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.659
Yes, you can.

37:42.661 --> 37:43.593
If it's laced with something
else, you can od from it.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.962
- I don't think so.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.365
- Did you cook this,
or did you buy it, Dax?

37:48.367 --> 37:50.233
- What?

37:50.235 --> 37:52.802
- Did you cook this, or did
you buy it?

37:52.804 --> 37:54.271
- I bought it,

37:54.273 --> 37:55.772
but

37:55.774 --> 37:57.307
the guy's okay.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.241
- Laced with what?

37:58.243 --> 37:59.342
- Pcp. Acid.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.377
I don't know, anything from
the streets

38:00.379 --> 38:01.244
can be bad these days.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.779
- I don't think so.

38:02.781 --> 38:03.613
- Knock it off!

38:03.615 --> 38:04.481
Goddammit!

38:04.483 --> 38:06.716
Come on, guys.

38:06.718 --> 38:07.584
- I should fucking kill you.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.020
- Is this helping?

38:10.022 --> 38:12.756
- Shut the fuck up!

38:28.073 --> 38:31.675
- We need to start walking back.

38:31.677 --> 38:36.012
We're not gonna have enough
water.

39:33.805 --> 39:37.440
- I love you.

39:37.442 --> 39:40.877
I love you so much.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.646
I'm sorry.

40:01.298 --> 40:03.466
- Fuckin' surreal.

40:03.468 --> 40:04.534
Shit.

40:24.856 --> 40:30.794
- I can't believe she's gone.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.195
- We need reception.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.563
Someone...

40:33.565 --> 40:36.666
Someone has to call her parents.

40:41.672 --> 40:46.409
- It looks like a tomb.

40:46.411 --> 40:48.311
- Come on.

40:48.313 --> 40:50.380
It looks like they're ready
to go.

41:02.359 --> 41:05.595
- Hey.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.630
We're all done in the rv, so

41:07.632 --> 41:10.467
whenever you're ready and
packed,

41:10.469 --> 41:14.337
we gotta get going, okay?

41:14.339 --> 41:17.006
All right.

41:58.782 --> 42:01.150
- A straight shot, huh, Troy?

42:01.152 --> 42:03.987
- We came in about
eight miles this way, so,

42:03.989 --> 42:07.991
you know, it's gonna be
about four hours going back.

42:12.697 --> 42:17.033
- Where are we?

42:17.035 --> 42:19.235
- Do we know where we're going?

42:19.237 --> 42:22.939
- I don't remember any of this.

42:22.941 --> 42:23.773
- Hey, jae, be careful.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.542
Watch your step.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.043
- If everyone
wasn't so fuckin' stoned.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.177
- Come on, look
at how dark it's getting.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.746
We don't have much time.

42:29.748 --> 42:30.914
- Yeah, I understand that.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.448
But we come in this
way, we go out in the...

42:32.450 --> 42:33.716
- No. No.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.051
Look at the sun.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.252
We don't have a lot of time.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.053
- We just gotta keep moving.

42:37.055 --> 42:37.921
I remember that Ridge.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.122
I remember that mountain.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.057
- I saw that mountain.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.825
- We need to
think about making camp.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.761
- All the fucking
mountains look the fucking same.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.729
- Keep moving this way.
We'll make camp if we have to.

42:46.731 --> 42:50.400
- Sorry to freak out.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.202
Lost in the hell of the
fucking desert.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.672
- Just shut the fuck up
and let's keep walking, okay?

42:55.674 --> 42:57.407
Enough crap.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.374
- Where's the fucking road?

42:58.376 --> 43:00.443
- Look, it's gonna be okay.

43:24.134 --> 43:25.835
- You gettin' anything?

43:25.837 --> 43:29.706
- No. Nothing.

43:43.887 --> 43:46.956
- Where are we?

43:46.958 --> 43:50.927
- I don't know.

44:00.871 --> 44:03.272
- Thanks.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.607
Is this all that we have?

44:04.609 --> 44:07.443
- Pretty much, yeah.

44:09.413 --> 44:12.081
Any luck?

44:12.083 --> 44:13.983
- Fuckin' nothin'.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.319
Fuck.

44:16.321 --> 44:20.923
I was supposed to check in
with her today.

44:20.925 --> 44:22.792
I have a daughter.

44:22.794 --> 44:26.429
I was supposed to call her to
wish her luck for tomorrow.

44:26.431 --> 44:27.330
She's in a play.

44:27.332 --> 44:30.633
Shakespeare, of all things.

44:30.635 --> 44:32.402
- What's her name?

44:32.404 --> 44:33.236
- Olivia.

44:33.238 --> 44:34.370
She's seven years old,

44:34.372 --> 44:39.842
and she plays a damn good
hermia.

44:39.844 --> 44:40.710
- Does your wife know you're
out here?

44:40.712 --> 44:45.615
- Ex-wife, thank you.

44:45.617 --> 44:48.051
Well, all right.

44:48.053 --> 44:50.486
So, we're in a national park,
right?

44:50.488 --> 44:53.923
There should be rangers
patrolling.

44:53.925 --> 44:56.726
The thing is, does anyone here

44:56.728 --> 44:59.295
have anyone that knows we're
out this way?

44:59.297 --> 45:00.997
- I told Jenny we were going
to Vegas.

45:00.999 --> 45:03.499
- Wow.

45:03.501 --> 45:05.702
You're a fuckin' genius,
aren't you?

45:05.704 --> 45:06.736
Bravo.

45:06.738 --> 45:08.905
Anyone else?

45:08.907 --> 45:10.239
- Yeah, "hey, daddy",

45:10.241 --> 45:11.908
"I'm gonna go out to the
middle of fucking nowhere"

45:11.910 --> 45:15.211
"with a bunch of hippies
to a dirty festival."

45:15.213 --> 45:17.447
No, no one else.

45:17.449 --> 45:20.383
- Rosemary's family
and some of our friends

45:20.385 --> 45:22.151
knew we were out here, but

45:22.153 --> 45:25.521
I don't think they were
expecting us to rush back.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.957
- Oh.

45:27.959 --> 45:30.159
We have been here two days.

45:30.161 --> 45:32.428
Haven't seen any rangers.

45:32.430 --> 45:35.031
We haven't...
- Ow.

45:35.033 --> 45:38.701
- Still haven't found the
road, I mean...

45:38.703 --> 45:40.636
How much water do we even have
left?

45:40.638 --> 45:44.807
- That's what concerns me.

45:46.009 --> 45:50.079
- Is that really a good
idea to be drinking that?

45:51.348 --> 45:53.483
- I didn't want it in the fire.

45:53.485 --> 45:57.220
I think that's a grand idea.

45:57.222 --> 45:59.055
- Yeah, me too.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.523
- You'll get dehydrated.

46:00.525 --> 46:04.393
- Well, I gotta knock myself
out.

46:04.395 --> 46:05.828
- Hey, Wade.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.830
Um...

46:07.832 --> 46:10.900
I'm kind of afraid and I think
something's broke in my tent.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.269
Do you think you can come
with me to check it out?

46:13.271 --> 46:14.303
- Yeah.

46:14.305 --> 46:18.274
- Thanks.

46:28.051 --> 46:28.818
- So what's going on, Dax?

46:28.820 --> 46:30.086
- What?

46:30.088 --> 46:31.287
- You okay?

46:31.289 --> 46:33.089
- Yeah.

46:33.091 --> 46:34.390
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:34.392 --> 46:38.394
This is fun.

47:00.884 --> 47:02.585
- What the fuck am I doing out
here?

47:03.721 --> 47:06.189
Jenny is so much fucking
smarter than me.

47:13.330 --> 47:17.300
I'm a fuckin' asshole.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.438
Okay. Okay, Wade.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.739
Okay.

47:23.741 --> 47:26.075
Ah!

47:26.077 --> 47:27.844
Oh, shit!

47:27.846 --> 47:31.848
Oh, shit!

47:32.749 --> 47:33.749
Oh, fuck!

47:33.751 --> 47:35.484
Oh.

47:35.486 --> 47:36.452
- What the fuck is...

47:36.454 --> 47:37.520
- Fucking something bit me.

47:37.522 --> 47:38.654
- What?
- Fuck.

47:38.656 --> 47:39.488
- Let's get him out of here.

47:39.490 --> 47:40.489
Just help. It's okay.

47:40.491 --> 47:41.390
- Fuck.

47:41.392 --> 47:43.292
- Guys, get out here now!

47:43.294 --> 47:44.560
Get out here, come on.

47:44.562 --> 47:45.428
- What happened?

47:45.430 --> 47:47.063
- Hey. Hey.

47:47.065 --> 47:48.264
- Hey, Robin.

47:48.266 --> 47:49.899
Robin!

47:49.901 --> 47:52.568
- What is it?
- Here.

47:52.570 --> 47:53.703
- A fuckin' snake bit him.

47:53.705 --> 47:55.304
There are rattlers and all
kinds of shit out here.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.272
- A fuckin' rattlesnake?

47:56.274 --> 47:57.974
- Yes, so just...

47:57.976 --> 47:59.876
Everybody stay the fuck
out of the brush, okay?

47:59.878 --> 48:01.310
- Aw, fuck.

48:01.312 --> 48:02.545
- It's gonna be okay.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.413
Look, we need something
to tie off this leg.

48:04.415 --> 48:07.617
- Do you actually know what
you're doing?

48:07.619 --> 48:08.684
- Christ, can we, like,

48:08.686 --> 48:10.453
suck the poison out or
something?

48:10.455 --> 48:12.421
- That doesn't actually work.

48:12.423 --> 48:15.558
- Have some water.

48:15.560 --> 48:19.395
- This needs to come off
every 15 minutes, okay?

48:20.297 --> 48:21.130
- You know what?

48:21.132 --> 48:21.964
Fuck

48:21.966 --> 48:23.833
this.

48:23.835 --> 48:25.368
This has all happened because
we,

48:25.370 --> 48:27.270
we helped you.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.771
So you know what?

48:28.773 --> 48:30.139
I'm fuckin' outta here, okay?

48:30.141 --> 48:31.540
You guys are fuckin' pathetic,

48:31.542 --> 48:32.975
you're fuckin' star-crossed,

48:32.977 --> 48:34.410
and I couldn't give a fuck
anymore.

48:34.412 --> 48:35.578
- Just breathe, breathe.

48:35.580 --> 48:35.578
- Aw, fuck.
- Do this.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.014
- I can fucking feel it
coming up my fuckin' leg, man.

48:38.016 --> 48:38.981
- I know.

48:38.983 --> 48:40.917
- If that snake was poisonous,

48:40.919 --> 48:41.851
then we've got to get him to a
hospital,

48:41.853 --> 48:43.352
or he's gonna die.

48:43.354 --> 48:44.186
- Yeah, no shit.

48:44.188 --> 48:47.323
- Yeah, but, I mean, we're lost.

48:47.758 --> 48:51.260
- There's gotta be a road
or a car or something.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.094
- Okay, well, all right.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.162
Let's see, let's see.

48:53.164 --> 48:55.197
- Where would the
nearest hospital even be?

48:55.199 --> 48:56.565
- Okay.

48:56.567 --> 48:57.500
Sun's over here.

48:57.502 --> 48:59.035
East, that's west, right.

48:59.037 --> 48:59.035
Did we...

48:59.037 --> 49:02.872
Came from that way, we
need to go west, right?

49:02.874 --> 49:04.941
Does that make sense?

49:07.511 --> 49:08.611
Wade doesn't have that much
time,

49:08.613 --> 49:11.714
and all I can see is fucking
desert.

49:18.221 --> 49:22.158
- Yeah, I'm back, you're
welcome.

49:23.226 --> 49:26.128
So what's the fucking plan, huh?

49:26.130 --> 49:28.130
- Well, the plan is we just
gotta keep walking, right?

49:28.132 --> 49:29.699
What else can we do?
We just gotta keep walking.

49:29.701 --> 49:31.167
- No, we don't just keep
walking.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.601
What about Wade down there, huh?

49:32.603 --> 49:34.437
- We're gonna have to leave him.
- - What?

49:34.439 --> 49:35.471
- She's right.

49:35.473 --> 49:37.039
- If we're gonna do that,

49:37.041 --> 49:38.474
we gotta leave somebody with
him, fine?

49:38.476 --> 49:39.408
- Fine.

49:39.410 --> 49:40.776
Dax can stay with him.

49:40.778 --> 49:42.178
- Because we gotta
get somebody back to him now,

49:42.180 --> 49:45.381
so let's move.

49:45.383 --> 49:47.216
Come on.

49:47.218 --> 49:48.250
I said come on!

49:48.252 --> 49:49.318
- We're coming!

49:52.689 --> 49:53.856
- I'm gonna tie this, okay?

49:53.858 --> 49:55.658
I gotta retie this.

49:55.660 --> 49:57.727
I gotta get this really tight

49:57.729 --> 49:59.261
so I can keep you healthy,

49:59.263 --> 50:00.743
cause we're gonna get you out
of here.

50:02.233 --> 50:03.599
- It fucking hurts, Dax.
- Jasmine's leaving.

50:03.601 --> 50:04.934
I'm not gonna leave you.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.136
What?

50:07.138 --> 50:10.473
- So we're gonna walk straight
that way.

50:10.475 --> 50:14.477
- You're leaving?

50:15.912 --> 50:18.047
- Just make sure you build a
fire, okay?

50:18.049 --> 50:19.515
- I am going to build a fire.

50:19.517 --> 50:20.950
- That way if we do get lost,

50:20.952 --> 50:22.752
we'll at least be able
to find our way back.

50:22.754 --> 50:23.953
- Okay, you're coming back,
then?

50:23.955 --> 50:25.021
- Yeah.

50:25.023 --> 50:25.688
- Okay.

50:25.690 --> 50:28.691
I'm gonna build a fire.

50:28.693 --> 50:30.092
- Wade.

50:30.094 --> 50:32.795
We're gonna be back soon with
help, okay?

50:32.797 --> 50:33.662
Just hang in there.

50:33.664 --> 50:34.430
- Hey.

50:34.432 --> 50:35.831
- Yeah?

50:35.833 --> 50:37.033
- Stay with him, okay?

50:37.035 --> 50:41.203
And don't do anything stupid.

50:47.144 --> 50:49.145
- I'll get it right.

50:49.147 --> 50:50.146
- It's okay, man.

50:50.148 --> 50:50.880
- He's right.

50:50.882 --> 50:50.880
- No, he's not right.

50:50.882 --> 50:53.682
He's a fuckin' asshole, and
we both know that, okay?

50:53.684 --> 50:55.518
He's got a stick up his ass.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.552
You know how to build a fire,
right?

50:56.554 --> 50:57.553
- Yeah.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.521
- Just keep your head
in the game.

50:58.523 --> 50:59.622
- I got my head in the game,
I'm just...

50:59.624 --> 51:01.023
- Okay, I trust you.

51:01.025 --> 51:02.558
- You just gotta come back.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.559
- Of course I'm coming back.

51:03.561 --> 51:04.593
No, I'm just gonna leave you
here.

51:04.595 --> 51:05.728
What the fuck.

51:05.730 --> 51:05.728
We'll find somebody,

51:05.730 --> 51:08.597
I'll make sure that they
get the fuck outta here,

51:08.599 --> 51:10.733
and then I'll come back myself
alone,

51:10.735 --> 51:12.101
so the three of us can have a
beer

51:12.103 --> 51:14.170
like we always fuckin'
wanted to and planned to,

51:14.172 --> 51:16.105
and we don't have to deal with
these jackasses, all right?

51:16.107 --> 51:16.105
- That sounds good.

51:16.107 --> 51:18.207
- Yeah, it sounds good to me,
too.

51:18.209 --> 51:21.343
All right, you.

51:21.345 --> 51:23.479
You go anywhere, I'm
gonna kick your ass, okay?

51:23.481 --> 51:24.947
So just stay put.

51:24.949 --> 51:26.248
- Fuckin', these fuckin' snakes.

51:26.250 --> 51:26.248
- And when I get back,

51:26.250 --> 51:30.219
there will be hamburgers,
strippers, booze.

51:30.221 --> 51:31.587
I mean, what is that,
it's just a little...

51:31.589 --> 51:32.588
Little nip anyway.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.457
You're gonna be fine.

51:34.459 --> 51:36.525
I know you can do this.

51:40.864 --> 51:41.997
I will see you soon.

51:41.999 --> 51:45.668
You just get your shit done,
okay?

51:45.670 --> 51:49.905
I'll be back!

51:50.340 --> 51:51.941
- Jesus Christ.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.509
Okay, I'm gonna make a fire,
okay?

51:53.511 --> 51:54.844
And they're gonna come back
with help,

51:54.846 --> 51:56.679
because they're gonna see the
fire,

51:56.681 --> 51:59.515
and they're gonna get us outta
here,

51:59.517 --> 52:00.649
and your leg's gonna hurt for
a while,

52:00.651 --> 52:01.817
and that's...

52:01.819 --> 52:03.652
You know, we'll be laughing
about it.

52:03.654 --> 52:06.555
You know.

52:06.557 --> 52:07.656
You want a drink?

52:07.658 --> 52:09.091
Okay.

52:09.093 --> 52:10.259
I'm just gonna give you a
little bit.

52:10.261 --> 52:15.598
I mean, I don't...

52:15.600 --> 52:17.266
Every fuckin' thing I touch

52:17.268 --> 52:20.369
just fuckin' turns to shit,
you know?

52:44.060 --> 52:45.728
- Robin.

52:45.730 --> 52:46.862
- You know what?

52:46.864 --> 52:48.597
Guys, we've been walking for
like

52:48.599 --> 52:51.800
four or five hours now.

52:51.802 --> 52:52.868
All right, I don't wanna
think the worst here...

52:52.870 --> 52:54.236
- then don't think the worst.

52:54.238 --> 52:55.571
- You know what?

52:55.573 --> 52:59.575
You need to shut your fuckin'
mouth.

52:59.577 --> 53:01.277
We need to head to higher
ground.

53:01.279 --> 53:05.381
Wipe that stupid smirk off
your face, too.

53:08.885 --> 53:10.219
- Look at...

53:10.221 --> 53:11.854
Oh, shit.

53:13.791 --> 53:14.857
Okay.

53:14.859 --> 53:17.026
I'm gonna get it started.

53:21.265 --> 53:22.932
Okay, I need to get the fire
going.

53:22.934 --> 53:24.133
Okay, I know.

53:24.135 --> 53:25.734
I know.

53:25.736 --> 53:28.170
I know, I know, I know.

53:37.949 --> 53:39.281
Okay.

53:39.283 --> 53:42.718
Okay, okay, okay, I got
something.

53:44.956 --> 53:45.854
Okay.

53:45.856 --> 53:47.056
All right.

53:55.999 --> 53:57.166
Fire's going.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.169
You can't see it,

54:00.171 --> 54:01.070
but it's gonna grow big.

54:01.072 --> 54:02.471
They're coming back.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.314
- Hey.

54:12.316 --> 54:15.584
Hey, this doesn't look right.

54:15.586 --> 54:16.318
- Wait.

54:16.320 --> 54:20.256
What the fuck are those?

54:20.258 --> 54:22.725
- I think those are sand dunes.

54:22.727 --> 54:24.760
Dax wouldn't stop talking
about them.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.328
They're some big tourist
attraction or something,

54:26.330 --> 54:28.797
so if they're a tourist
thing, there's people.

54:28.799 --> 54:30.332
- People.

54:30.334 --> 54:31.166
- All right?
- Yes!

54:31.168 --> 54:32.134
- Come on. Go!

54:32.136 --> 54:33.535
- Come on.

54:33.537 --> 54:34.436
Hey, Heather, come on!

54:34.438 --> 54:36.338
- Come on!

54:36.340 --> 54:40.542
Come on!

54:41.378 --> 54:43.112
- Come on.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.246
- I can't breathe.

54:44.248 --> 54:45.281
- You can do it, come on.

54:54.891 --> 54:56.458
- They're coming back.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.427
I don't wanna scare you,

54:58.429 --> 55:01.263
but I think I should say
some things to you right now.

55:02.198 --> 55:06.201
I think, um...

55:07.537 --> 55:10.939
You're my best friend, Wade.

55:10.941 --> 55:13.175
You are.

55:13.177 --> 55:14.576
You're my best friend, and,
um...

55:14.578 --> 55:17.313
Um...

55:17.315 --> 55:19.915
I love you.

55:19.917 --> 55:23.919
No, no, no, no.

55:24.354 --> 55:28.590
I love you.

56:26.883 --> 56:27.816
- Anything?

56:27.818 --> 56:29.952
- Nothing.

56:29.954 --> 56:33.789
- My phone's about to die.

56:33.791 --> 56:34.923
- There's gotta be somebody
around here.

56:34.925 --> 56:36.759
These fuckin' dunes,

56:36.761 --> 56:37.893
those guys come out in the
buggies and all that shit.

56:37.895 --> 56:39.795
- I know, I know.

56:39.797 --> 56:41.230
This is the exact kind of place
that they would go, right?

56:41.232 --> 56:43.065
- Fuck.

56:43.067 --> 56:43.966
- Where are the fucking roads?

56:43.968 --> 56:45.567
Where's the fucking roads?

56:45.569 --> 56:47.102
- There are no roads, honey.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.104
There are no fucking roads
because we're fucking lost!

56:49.106 --> 56:49.938
- Don't fucking yell at me!

56:49.940 --> 56:51.106
- Hey, guys.

56:51.108 --> 56:54.276
Please, for god's sake,
we have to stick together.

56:54.278 --> 56:55.210
- Oh, bullshit.

56:55.212 --> 56:56.612
- Look, guys,

56:56.614 --> 56:58.213
we're almost out of water.

56:58.215 --> 57:00.849
- My phone's dead.

57:00.851 --> 57:03.252
I can't fucking do this anymore.

57:03.254 --> 57:04.353
- Robin, there's some in my bag.

57:04.355 --> 57:05.421
- No, no, no.

57:05.423 --> 57:06.955
Forget about it.

57:06.957 --> 57:08.957
- I'm done.

57:08.959 --> 57:10.192
- Yeah, you are.

57:10.194 --> 57:10.993
- No, you're not.

57:10.995 --> 57:12.795
- Fuck you.
- Yep.

57:12.797 --> 57:15.864
- Don't talk to me again,
I swear to fucking god.

57:17.634 --> 57:19.134
- How can this fucking happen?

57:19.136 --> 57:20.536
We've been out here for days.

57:20.538 --> 57:21.503
We haven't seen a person,
a fucking telephone pole,

57:21.505 --> 57:24.573
tire tracks, fuckin' nothing.

57:24.575 --> 57:26.508
What are the fuckin' odds?

57:26.510 --> 57:28.076
We must have covered at least
50 miles.

57:28.078 --> 57:30.746
- Look, we're gonna have to
make camp tonight, again.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.314
- Yeah.

57:32.316 --> 57:33.449
- How? With what?

57:33.451 --> 57:34.750
- I don't know.

57:34.752 --> 57:36.218
I don't know.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.686
I'm gonna go look.

57:37.688 --> 57:40.756
I'm gonna go look, I'm gonna
go try to find something.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.861
We're gonna walk again
in the morning, okay?

57:45.863 --> 57:48.564
- Sure.

57:48.566 --> 57:49.665
- I'm just gonna close my eyes.

57:49.667 --> 57:50.766
- Yeah, you do that.

57:50.768 --> 57:54.803
Oh.

58:05.348 --> 58:08.350
- Why are you doing this?

58:08.352 --> 58:10.953
Huh?

58:10.955 --> 58:14.156
Why are you doing this.

58:14.158 --> 58:18.227
You and Troy have been
riding me this entire trip.

58:19.496 --> 58:23.198
I don't give a shit
about those other people.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.001
That's it.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.736
I gotta fuckin' do something

58:27.738 --> 58:29.671
or say something to someone.

58:29.673 --> 58:33.675
Hey.

58:36.012 --> 58:39.982
No, I'm not gonna...

58:44.354 --> 58:47.022
Huh.

58:47.024 --> 58:49.558
Yeah, right.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.726
I'm not in a place right now

58:50.728 --> 58:54.830
where you should be doing this
to me.

58:55.265 --> 58:58.300
All right?

59:10.080 --> 59:12.681
Fuck you.

59:12.683 --> 59:14.816
I'm gonna take my chances.

59:14.818 --> 59:18.921
I'm gonna take my chances out
here.

59:24.661 --> 59:26.495
Ugh.

59:26.497 --> 59:29.631
I'd better make the fuckin'
news.

59:37.140 --> 59:38.307
Ah! God...

59:38.309 --> 59:39.841
Fuck.

59:39.843 --> 59:42.844
Dammit.

59:43.980 --> 59:44.913
God...

59:44.915 --> 59:45.681
Ugh!

59:45.683 --> 59:49.217
Ugh!

59:58.695 --> 01:00:01.863
They're never coming back.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:09.037
Never coming back.

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:13.742
They left us.

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:55.017
- My mom died
while you were in prison.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:59.021
- I'm sorry.

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:03.425
I didn't know.

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:08.897
- How would you have known?

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.934
We've barely even spoken
since we were 10 years old.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:21.943
- We used to be good friends.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.048
- If we make it out of this, I
would...

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:29.117
I'd really like to be friends
again.

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:33.121
- Me, too.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.194
- Can I ask you something?

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:43.198
- Sure.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:48.036
- Did you mean to kill your mom?

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.376
- Yeah.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:58.413
- Why?

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:02.584
- She was mentally ill.

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:06.455
You know, when I was about
15, she just turned on me.

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:13.061
Robin was already gone.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:17.132
My dad and I, we just had
to watch her deteriorate.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:25.006
I mean, I can't think of
anything worse.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:29.144
Not being able to control your
own mind.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.283
She was paranoid my dad
was cheating on her.

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:41.990
And they would fight
all night about nothing.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.895
He wouldn't send her away.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.904
And they had a gun in the
bedroom for emergencies.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.940
She came home one night,

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:03.044
and she was just screaming at
him about...

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.581
About some student.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.485
And she had this look in her
eyes.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:17.259
She went at him with the knife.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.866
You know, and I loved him so
much,

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.904
I just shot her.

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:38.713
I'd never even fired a gun
before.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:47.088
- I'm just...

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:51.793
I'm so, so sorry.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:02.404
Was it Rosemary?

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:12.714
- We should get some sleep.

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.050
- Robin.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:16.885
Does he know?

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:19.221
- No.

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:23.191
And he's not going to.

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.346
- Listen to me.

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.248
You're not gonna like this.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.083
But I need to walk alone.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:56.151
- No. Robin!

01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:57.319
- Listen to me.
- No!

01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.720
- I've been thinking a lot
about where the sun was

01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:00.221
when we drove in, right?

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:01.222
It was in the west.

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.591
I know, I know for a fact if I
just walk...

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:04.492
- no, please!

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.561
You can't leave me with them!

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:08.463
- The girls need you.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.365
You have to stay with them.

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:11.800
They can't do this without you.

01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:13.601
- It's not, please, I can't
lose you, too.

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:15.704
- We are out of options.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:17.466
If I don't do this,
we're gonna die out here.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:20.508
You gotta trust me.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:23.812
You're my little sister.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.247
This is what big brothers do.

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:28.383
Okay?

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.452
I have a great sense of
direction, you know that.

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:32.787
You remember when we'd go to
the mall?

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:34.589
You'd never remember
where the car was parked.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:37.592
Huh?

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:38.927
You're gonna be fine.

01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:42.263
And before you know it,
I'm gonna be right back.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:44.099
- You promise?

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:44.933
- I promise.

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:47.535
I'm coming back, I promise you.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:51.306
I love you.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:52.207
All right?

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:54.609
I'm gonna get us outta here.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:58.780
It's my turn to protect you.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:03.918
This is gonna be fine.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:10.925
- I love you, too.

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:23.938
- How are we supposed to start
a fire

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.675
when your brother took
the goddamn lighter?

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:31.146
What, you think you're
fuckin' MacGyver now?

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:35.150
This I gotta see.

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.718
- Yes.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.686
All right, here we go.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.221
- How do you know how to do
that?

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.891
- We went camping a lot when
we were kids.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:45.527
- Do we have any water left?

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:46.428
- Nope.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.862
- Here.

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:48.763
Drink.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.131
Robin will be back soon.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:51.032
- Are you sure?

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.034
- Really.

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:54.803
You just give her the last of
the water.

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:57.338
You don't even think
about sharing, asking?

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.973
- She needs it.

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:00.408
- Fuck you.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.243
Fuck all of you.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.745
And you know what?

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.380
Robin isn't coming back.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:06.681
He isn't fucking coming back

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:08.216
because he's fucking
face-down dead in a fucking...

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:10.852
- Fuck you!
- Abandoned ditch.

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:14.489
Dead, just like the
rest of us are gonna be.

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:18.126
We are fucked!

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:20.028
- Nice one.
- Nice, yeah.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:23.398
Why don't you
fuckin' face facts?

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.233
We are absolutely fucked.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.935
Yeah, go, keep...

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:27.801
Go run with your little friend
over there.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:29.337
There's a box of tampons.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:33.308
Go have a fuckin' pity party.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:54.562
- What the fuck for.

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:09.377
- Troy?

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:10.345
- What.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.446
- I have to pee.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:12.981
- What? Just go here.

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:15.617
- No, I don't wanna go in camp.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.685
- Like I fuckin' give a damn.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:19.621
I'm not going anywhere, so
go by your fuckin' self.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.622
Shit.

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:21.389
I'm so fuckin'...

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.557
- where?

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.392
- Well, gee, I don't know.

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.894
There's a rock.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.694
And you see, there's a rock
there.

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:30.298
There's a rock there.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.533
I think there are a few places.

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:33.635
Go deep.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:34.669
- You're such a fucking asshole.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.970
I can hardly walk.

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:41.542
- Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.657
- Hey.

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:58.593
You okay?

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:02.397
- What if Robin doesn't come
back?

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:05.700
- He's coming back, jae.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.569
- You know, when you were gone,

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:09.704
he looked after all of us,
and...

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:13.141
I have too many stories I
could tell you.

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:16.444
He's coming back.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:20.415
Just trust me.

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:26.221
Come on, we should go.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.492
- Oh, my god.

01:10:31.494 --> 01:10:34.395
- What?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.230
- Look.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:37.265
- What the fuck is that?

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.433
- A storm's coming in.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:39.968
We have to move.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:44.005
Come on.

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:47.475
- Fuck.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:51.479
No snakes.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.646
- Ugh.

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:27.682
Motherfucker.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:31.653
- What the fuck?

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:38.526
Guys?

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.062
- Oh, god.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:42.563
Hey!

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.833
Hey, let's go.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:48.636
- What the fuck is the matter?

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.372
What the hell?

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.340
- Where's Jasmine?

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.775
- I don't fuckin' know!

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:54.642
Just fuckin' go!

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.678
- Jasmine!

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.212
Jasmine!

01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:01.316
- There's a ravine down
this way.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:02.317
- Fucker.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.686
You motherfuckers.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:15.363
- Where the fuck am I?

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:19.334
Where the fuck am I?

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.502
- Down here.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:22.437
We can get in down here.

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.005
Come on.

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:26.140
- We can't
leave without Jasmine!

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:27.408
- Now, come on!

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:28.743
We gotta go!

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:30.778
We don't know where she is,
okay?

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.779
You guys can make it.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.348
We can't worry about her.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.116
If we get down in there...

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:39.120
Oh, shit.

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:48.429
Come on.

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:57.405
- Jasmine!

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.436
- Ah!

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:29.504
Ha ha!

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:32.273
Holy shit!

01:13:32.275 --> 01:13:34.642
What the fuck do you want?

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:37.145
Why the fuck not?

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.112
Ha.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:40.548
Why the fuck not?

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:44.051
Come on, motherfucker.

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:48.055
Come on, motherfucker!

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:43.911
- Tell me we're clear.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:45.913
Come on.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:49.951
Ugh.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:10.771
- Is everyone okay?

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:13.574
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:17.478
- Okay, we really have
to find Jasmine now.

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.248
- I think

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:24.218
she went that way.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.988
- You knew where she was?

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.955
- Hey. Hey.

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.357
- Hey.

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:32.660
Three alive is better
than four dead, all right?

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:34.295
And for all we know,

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:36.631
she coulda hunkered down
somewhere just like us.

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:37.465
- I'm...

01:15:37.467 --> 01:15:38.599
I'm done!

01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:40.434
I'm done.

01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:42.770
- Well you could've joined her.

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:44.171
- Heather, we'll find her.

01:15:57.419 --> 01:16:01.155
- Fuck.

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.567
- Robin went this way.

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:48.402
- Uh-uh.
We go this way.

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:50.471
Easier.
- No.

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:53.207
- I am not following
your idiot brother.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.809
- I trust him more than I
trust you.

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:57.044
- Oh. Good.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:57.745
Where are you even going. Huh?

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.413
Huh?

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:00.781
- Fine! Stay!

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:02.683
- Yeah. You just keep
walkin'!

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:03.818
That's a lot safer. Isn't it?

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.853
Look at her!

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:09.256
That's what's gonna happen to
you!

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:10.458
You'll fuckin' die.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.559
I'm gonna make it!

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:36.484
You motherfucker!

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:47.595
Ow! Fucking wrist!

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.833
Well. Fuck that, too.

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.743
- Come on.

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:05.179
You can do this.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.681
Down is a hell of a lot easier
than up.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:09.950
Fuckin' idiots.

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:17.958
Once more unto the breach. All
right.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.629
I swear. That looks like a
path to me.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.470
Oh. Boy. Come on.

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:02.263
- No.

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.507
Heather.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:17.444
We can't stop.

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:30.825
- Just lay with me.

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.170
- Yeah. Okay.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:04.859
- Sand.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:07.695
This damn sand in my lungs.

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:10.764
Sand everywhere in this
fucking desert.

01:21:10.766 --> 01:21:13.334
Sorry. I don't mean fucking
desert.

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:16.103
That's disrespectful.

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:20.374
You're gonna kill 'em all.
Aren't you?

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.477
You're gonna kill 'em all.

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:29.583
No. Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:32.453
I forgive 'em.

01:21:32.455 --> 01:21:33.754
I forgive you.

01:21:33.756 --> 01:21:35.689
And if I can forgive
'em. You can forgive 'em.

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:52.039
Whoa.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.073
Fuck!

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.642
Ha ha!

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:23.804
Beautiful.

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:25.139
So beautiful.

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:28.409
We did this...
