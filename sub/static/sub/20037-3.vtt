00:01.600 --> 00:02.719
I'm soon taking
a fine new house,

00:02.719 --> 00:04.078
in Soho, Greek Street.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.639
This move is too much risk.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.640
Is your master in?

00:06.641 --> 00:08.639
Mr. Lennox is my husband.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.479
Harriet knows all about us.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.999
You want me to invest
in your house, and I shall.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.639
I am in need of a girl.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.799
A sweet, untouched hanging risk.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.959
- Hello, sprat.
- I'm not a sprat anymore.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.359
Have to keep myself pure
for Lord Reptile.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.200
Tell Dame Death
Mary Cooper's dead.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:58.120 --> 00:59.519
Under normal circumstances,

00:59.520 --> 01:01.279
the Crown could fall,
Christ could rise,

01:01.280 --> 01:02.999
and a gentleman would still
find himself well met

01:03.000 --> 01:04.479
at the door of Margaret Wells,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.479
but today, we are closed.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.119
Closed?

01:08.120 --> 01:10.559
Tomorrow we re-open
in Greek Street.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.039
But I must warn you.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.039
Mrs. Wells has tweaked
the tariffs in accordance.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.639
More money for the same girls?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.679
Way of the world, Mr. Armitage.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.479
You can flog a sweetmeat
for twice the price

01:19.480 --> 01:22.120
if it's in a pretty paper.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.120
There'll be no "twice the price"

01:26.121 --> 01:27.679
coming our way.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.279
Mr. Armitage is
exactly the breed

01:29.280 --> 01:31.039
we don't want following us.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.559
I like him.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.279
He's got lovely thick arms.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.919
Better than Lord Repton's.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.199
Weak and flabby from
a life of opulence.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.400
Better than his pintle.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.759
It's crooked.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.119
Poor old wonky.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.319
You're just jealous I'll be
off gallivanting in splendor.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.319
You're almost
a proper lady, Lucy.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.479
And you're almost
a proper whore.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.920
Can I not rely
on you for better?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.759
Do want the other girls
to piss in your supper?

02:02.760 --> 02:04.119
I was just joking, Ma.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.479
There is an art to joking

02:05.480 --> 02:07.559
without putting
yourself above 'em.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.839
Am I not above them?

02:08.840 --> 02:10.839
You make yourself
the toast of the Reptons

02:10.840 --> 02:12.839
and they will catapult
you to the heavens,

02:12.840 --> 02:14.880
just as they did Charlotte.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.120
I don't want a life
like Kitty and Fanny.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.839
You...

02:29.840 --> 02:31.879
you are gold

02:31.880 --> 02:34.399
and they are pinchbeck.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.000
Won't prove that by gloating.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.000
The carriage!

02:54.560 --> 02:56.680
Mrs. Lennox?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.999
Nathaniel was
stricken last night.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.999
The doctor says his
heart is failing him.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.799
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.399
He wants you.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.880
You must ride back
with me now to see him.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.439
You visit for more
than the amusements,

03:41.440 --> 03:43.599
Justice Cunliffe?

03:43.600 --> 03:47.959
The beast requires
feeding again.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.679
If I knew the
nature of the beast,

03:49.680 --> 03:52.399
how much better
I could nourish it.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.839
And procuring unused
girls is perilous.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.719
Are they worthy of the risk?

03:58.720 --> 04:00.600
Most certainly.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.239
If this is you...

04:09.240 --> 04:11.120
who are they?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.159
- Hmph.
- Closer.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.360
Though they are without heart.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.919
I will depart, madam,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.279
before a stench like the
fleet ditch reaches me.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.680
Our business is not concluded.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.239
You vile wretch!

04:56.240 --> 04:58.039
You're more repulsive
than the blackening corpse

04:58.040 --> 04:59.719
left on my doorstep.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.159
It wasn't deliberate, Mumma,
I think her belly is unsettled.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.799
Then today you will fast

05:03.800 --> 05:06.359
so as not to upset
your stomach further.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.360
Forgive me, gentlemen!

05:11.040 --> 05:12.999
"I support my right
honorable friend's assertion

05:13.000 --> 05:16.120
that the cost of war
has been grave."

05:18.360 --> 05:19.599
This will be my first
speech in Parliament

05:19.600 --> 05:21.559
and you're not even listening.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.119
I'm hanging on your
every word, my love.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.399
I can't help thinking
your wife would make

05:25.400 --> 05:26.799
a better audience.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.159
Lady Caroline's
a passionless shrew.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.120
She wouldn't understand
an artful performance

05:29.121 --> 05:30.479
if it fumbled her cockle.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.479
I'm not asking you to
understand the politics.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.999
I understand that
Parliament wants to tax

05:34.000 --> 05:35.359
the natives in the colonies

05:35.360 --> 05:39.399
to get back what was
spent fighting them.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.039
You make it sound unreasonable.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.399
Then perhaps I do
not understand it

05:43.400 --> 05:45.680
as well as I thought.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.560
There a more straightforward
performance you could show me?

05:57.160 --> 05:58.599
Don't scratch it,

05:58.600 --> 06:00.279
or they'll dump you
on the church steps.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.840
Up.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.919
You look so handsome, Lucy.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.159
You won't be a bit out
of place at the Reptons.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.599
Old wonky.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.799
I shall have to mount with care.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.360
The men at the new house
will love you, Fanny.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.719
Master Benjamin is with him now.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.919
The children!

06:42.920 --> 06:45.160
Mama, Mama!

06:46.720 --> 06:48.119
Shh!

06:48.120 --> 06:49.679
Come to me.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.280
- I'm so sorry.
- Is Papa with angels?

06:57.360 --> 07:00.120
No!

07:14.800 --> 07:19.480
Our faces will not always fit
as well as they have done here.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.799
I won't mind moving
to Greek Street.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.040
I could use some luxury.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.480
There'll be plenty
of pockets to lighten.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.599
Off you go, then.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.039
Goodbye!

07:45.040 --> 07:46.399
Be seeing you!

07:46.400 --> 07:47.719
Goodbye!

07:47.720 --> 07:49.000
Come visit us!

08:09.840 --> 08:11.599
Excuse me.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.839
Excuse me!

08:12.840 --> 08:14.599
Yes, miss?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.159
This is not the way
to the Reptons'.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.160
We're going to
their country estate.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.919
Stop!

08:23.920 --> 08:26.479
Do you hear me,
I want you to stop.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.920
I wasn't told I'd
be leaving London.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.799
If you will not take me home,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.438
then I will get out
and make my own way.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.958
And become the
plunder of footpads?

08:35.960 --> 08:40.720
It won't just be your purse
they shove their fingers in.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.199
I want to go home.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.719
Then I will take you.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.120
But you will have
to make good with me.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.720
My mother will pay you
as soon as we return.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.119
You can take me in your
mouth, if you prefer.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.719
I'm a guest of your master.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.439
You are not his guest,
you are his doxy.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.480
And you won't even be that
once you've jilted him.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.119
Have to drag 'em
out their cannons.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.240
All right, here we go.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.759
I think you're on
the wrong street, friend.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.959
I'm sure I'm not, friend.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.600
I said leave her alone!

10:08.880 --> 10:10.199
Don't touch her!

10:10.200 --> 10:11.359
Hay!

10:11.360 --> 10:12.959
Get your grubby fingers off her!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.239
We've not come
looking for trouble.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.599
Well, then take
your rancid bitches

10:16.600 --> 10:18.999
and your rabid
little picaninny...

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
and fuck off.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.719
Filthy beast!

10:42.720 --> 10:44.119
- We're going.
- Yeah?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.719
Next time, we won't
be so merciful.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.479
Fuck you, dead boy!

10:48.480 --> 10:50.999
- You're disgusting.
- You are a trollop.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.319
Go!

10:52.320 --> 10:54.359
- Fucking oaf!
- You're a maggot boiler.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.839
You're a maggot boiler,
that's all you are!

10:55.840 --> 10:58.240
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

11:06.240 --> 11:07.960
They are retreating.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.359
They are.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.880
Then our undertaking
is accomplished.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.639
By organizing a few
mischief makers

11:18.640 --> 11:21.839
and a sack of slops?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.719
They will return,

11:23.720 --> 11:25.519
and you will attach
yourself to that house

11:25.520 --> 11:28.439
like a dog on a rope.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.479
The gentlemen should
be scared to pass you.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.719
I am no dog, Mrs. Quigley.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.959
I do hope you are not
too proud for the task.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.359
Because there are
others I could install

11:41.360 --> 11:44.119
in this house.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.320
And you could be
back in your hovel.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.839
You have not been born
rich or fortunate enough

12:15.840 --> 12:18.840
to enjoy congress
with the likes of me.

12:21.880 --> 12:25.999
I do hope your journey was
not too torturous, my dear.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.959
I'm sure you'll want to bathe.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.359
Scrub London from your skin.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.320
Come on.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.640
What will I do now?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.600
What will become of us?

12:59.480 --> 13:03.599
I'm not really his wife.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.839
His children are bastards.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.720
You know if you're provided for?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.439
You must check

13:13.440 --> 13:15.719
before Benjamin returns.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.079
But what if I am not?

13:17.080 --> 13:19.599
Then rectify it.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.759
Commit a fraud?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.959
Commit Nathaniel's
wishes to paper,

13:24.960 --> 13:27.719
nothing more.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.240
You do not have the
luxury of compunction.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.240
You've left me
mid-game, old friend.

14:01.480 --> 14:05.959
My freedom papers.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.760
The greatest gift
Nathaniel ever gave me.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.880
They... they aren't signed.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.359
Did he lie when
he said I was free?

14:26.360 --> 14:27.839
Fate smiles upon you.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.239
Smile back.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.840
Do it!

14:40.320 --> 14:42.079
What are you doing in here?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.839
- My condolences, master.
- My father is not yet cold.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.320
You will not
scavenge here today.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.519
That sour tits will
have me starved!

15:08.520 --> 15:12.999
You bait the bear and then
cry when it mauls you.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.999
No food, no fancy.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.839
I haven't the energy.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.959
I'm throbbing.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.439
Your hand will do.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.479
Mine is limp with hunger.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.320
Use your own.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.839
She has spent this much
already this year.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.599
Lady Caroline, she
has spent that much

15:55.600 --> 15:57.480
already this month.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.359
She is like nothing
I have ever known.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.879
How so?

16:02.880 --> 16:06.719
It is she who possesses him.

16:06.720 --> 16:10.960
She is the wickedest harpy.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.359
I'm here to surprise my
husband upon his return.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.840
It's not every day one makes
one's debut in Parliament.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.479
I watched Sir George
rehearse his speech.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.199
Very impressive.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.599
You are easily impressed.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.639
My husband is a man child.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.599
A fopdoodle who's
frittering away my fortune.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.639
In the eyes of the law,
it is Sir George's fortune,

16:57.640 --> 16:59.079
of course,

16:59.080 --> 17:02.599
but in reality,
it was gifted to me

17:02.600 --> 17:06.559
by prudent ancestors.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.878
Marriage is the
worst kind of thief.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.239
Then you will be my ally.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.638
In what?

17:14.640 --> 17:16.679
In curbing
Sir George's extravagance.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.799
His finances are not my concern.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.199
His estate falls into disrepair.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.520
You are ruining him.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.239
If you'll excuse me,
Sir George has sent word.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.239
His speech is delivered
and he requires.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.799
Miss Wells's company.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.879
Well, we'll send a
message that you are here.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.999
He will return at once.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.320
We both know he will not.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.480
You will excuse me
while I dress?

17:48.480 --> 17:51.319
But do take these with you.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.000
They're yours, after all.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.880
There's no need
to hide yourself, Lucy.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.480
Come.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.720
And here...

18:40.240 --> 18:42.440
is a token.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.880
A little doll
for our little doll.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.760
She's beautiful.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.920
But she doesn't hold
a candle to you.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.639
Now.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.479
Hurry and dress.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.400
This afternoon, we hunt.

19:23.920 --> 19:27.200
Hurry, we will be late.

19:46.240 --> 19:49.559
Good... very good.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.399
I am stuffing you full!

19:51.400 --> 19:54.960
Full to bursting.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.479
You've got to stop
playing the jester.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.759
Mumma once starved
a girl for three days.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.759
She didn't have a little
Charlie to look after her,

20:09.760 --> 20:13.479
- did she?
- I'm not joking, Emily.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.960
If you go at her too far,
she'll give you Mr. Osborne.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.760
And who is Mr. Osborne?

20:23.160 --> 20:25.320
He's the short straw.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.439
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:29.440 --> 20:30.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:32.320 --> 20:33.960
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:52.480 --> 20:54.159
Confounded musket.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.799
The sight ain't true.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.559
Perhaps you should
take a shot, Lucy.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.480
Lord Repton will show you.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.519
There.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.280
That's it.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.440
Clever girl.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.319
I can feel your heart fluttering

21:29.320 --> 21:31.760
like a little beast's.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.520
Where's Lady Repton?

21:42.080 --> 21:45.479
I don't know.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.720
Lucy!

21:49.960 --> 21:51.680
You'd better go to her.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.720
Lucy!

21:59.640 --> 22:02.320
You'd better run, girl,
she might need your help.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.240
Quickly, now!

22:18.320 --> 22:21.919
You'd better run, Lucy.

22:21.920 --> 22:25.520
We can see you, Lucy.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.200
We're following
your little trail.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.880
The dogs are off
the leash, Lucy!

22:39.440 --> 22:41.280
Not far now.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.560
That's it... run, girl!

22:47.720 --> 22:51.080
We're getting closer.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.079
Good girl.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.560
Your first kill.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.879
Margaret will solve it.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.440
She's clever as a cat.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.520
Where is he?

23:30.521 --> 23:32.280
Hisses like one too.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.880
We'll leave them to it, girls.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.519
Don't start, Margaret.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.479
How could you
abandon that house?

23:44.480 --> 23:46.999
You've watched me fight
tooth-and-claw for it.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.879
We were ambushed.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.559
Fanny was practically
frigged in front of me.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.239
- You could have fought.
- I did fight!

23:53.240 --> 23:55.159
What, with all your passion?

23:55.160 --> 23:56.639
I'd have ripped the
sinews from their necks

23:56.640 --> 23:58.719
before I walked
away from my house.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.039
Well, I'm not like
you, Margaret.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.439
I can't wear blinkers
to the cost of it all.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.919
What cost?

24:05.920 --> 24:08.199
The cost to Jacob, to Lucy.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.719
- The cost to all of us.
- Would you have Lucy

24:09.720 --> 24:11.679
rut her days away as
a bawdy house whore?

24:11.680 --> 24:13.199
Or better still, some smock-wife

24:13.200 --> 24:14.799
to a penniless laborer?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.759
And what about Jacob?

24:16.760 --> 24:19.399
Shall we teach him
to crawl on his belly

24:19.400 --> 24:21.400
as some rich man's boy?

24:28.160 --> 24:30.639
I am weary of doing this alone.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.959
You do it alone?

24:31.960 --> 24:33.639
Sometimes I feel I do.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.479
I'll tell you what
you're alone in, woman.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.679
The noxious squabble
with Lydia Quigley

24:39.680 --> 24:42.199
that you're too
puffed-up to finish.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.719
What's that got
to do with anything?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.799
You think those louts
paid for themselves?

24:45.800 --> 24:47.919
It's payback

24:47.920 --> 24:49.279
for Mary Cooper.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.999
You can't know that.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.479
Don't add stupidity to the list
of your misdeeds, Margaret.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.440
Plenty long enough already.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.959
Nathaniel Lennox.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.199
He was a slave owner, Mags.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.280
He's chosen the
worst moment to die.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.719
You pretend it's only
your pocket feels the ache.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.919
I remember sometimes
you tupped him for free.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.200
You should have slapped me
for my foolishness.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.719
His wife said he got lusty
about me on his death bed.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.239
Filthy dog.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.000
His prick was stiff
before the rest of him.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.279
I wonder if Will
won't dance a jig

26:01.280 --> 26:02.719
when my time comes.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.999
It'll be your own fault,
you nipping crab.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.199
You've forgotten
he's the only man

26:07.200 --> 26:09.480
you've never made pay for it.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.639
Enough.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.280
Tell me, how can I get
into Greek Street?

26:22.400 --> 26:25.079
You've a very solemn
countenance today, Miss Wells.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.639
Why don't you join me and
I'll see if I can rectify it?

26:28.640 --> 26:31.519
Alas, I'm summoned
to service my master.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.999
He'd have you
pleasure him in public?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.919
Only with words.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.479
It's harlotting we do
with our clothes on

26:36.480 --> 26:38.200
that matters most.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.239
Charlotte!

26:41.240 --> 26:42.800
Why are you loitering?

26:46.520 --> 26:50.959
To warn you in private that
Haxby conspires against you.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.799
He summoned Lady Caroline
to curb your spending.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.559
The impertinent gargoyle!

26:57.560 --> 26:58.999
He picked the wrong fellow

26:59.000 --> 27:00.479
if he thinks that George Howard

27:00.480 --> 27:02.559
will be enfeebled.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.919
Well, he has indeed.

27:03.920 --> 27:04.920
Come.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.479
Sir Christopher.

27:10.480 --> 27:14.079
Did my lord acquit himself
well in the House today?

27:14.080 --> 27:17.279
He was... masterful.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.000
As always.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.519
Later, you shall master me.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.199
Lord Howard,

27:26.200 --> 27:29.720
I am throbbing with envy.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.639
You take our
mischief in the woods

27:44.640 --> 27:49.039
very timidly, Lucy.

27:49.040 --> 27:53.240
Where's that Wells
wild streak I'm so fond of?

27:55.320 --> 27:59.159
Have you no retort?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.239
Sir, you are too cruel.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.480
She's not yet out of her shell.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.000
I'm sure Charlotte Wells
never had a shell.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.319
Lord Repton should be
careful I don't tell everyone

28:19.320 --> 28:21.879
he didn't hit a target all day.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.000
He should indeed.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.719
Every shot he made was wonky.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.000
I shall call him Lord Wonky.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.440
This fricassee is delicious.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.919
Off to bed, off to bed.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.999
Come, come on,
hold on to my arm.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.399
What is it, Mama?

29:12.400 --> 29:14.759
Hold on to my arm...
Quiet, quiet!

29:14.760 --> 29:16.519
Come.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.720
Come!

29:19.880 --> 29:23.279
Stealing away like a thief

29:23.280 --> 29:25.680
when I was coming
to bring you these.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.440
My freedom papers.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.519
You've signed them.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.999
To release myself from
my father's depravity.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.480
- I wasn't sure you would.
- Just go.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.239
Come!

29:56.240 --> 29:59.399
The deed grants you
your own liberty.

29:59.400 --> 30:03.799
It doesn't extend
to the children.

30:03.800 --> 30:04.999
So we're not free at all?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.479
You are free.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.519
- I won't leave them.
- The choice isn't yours.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.959
Abigail, the children.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.519
No, it's... no, you...

30:14.520 --> 30:16.199
No, you can't keep them!

30:16.200 --> 30:17.719
I don't intend to.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.319
They will have most value to me

30:19.320 --> 30:21.159
on the plantation.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.399
No!

30:22.400 --> 30:23.999
- Mama.
- Mama!

30:24.000 --> 30:26.479
No, please, Benjamin.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.799
Please, Benjamin, no.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.880
You will go.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.279
We're not shy of men,
what are you doing?

30:59.280 --> 31:02.320
Fighting, Margaret,
like I always did.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.560
You are returned with
your organ grinder.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.680
Get him, boys!

31:13.440 --> 31:15.759
Nancy, go on, Nancy, get him!

31:15.760 --> 31:18.240
Get him, girl!

31:29.760 --> 31:32.719
Keep away from the cart!

31:32.720 --> 31:34.520
Piece of shit!

31:41.080 --> 31:42.399
Run for the watch, girl,

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
as though your life
depends upon it!

31:43.401 --> 31:45.200
Yes, Mother!

32:08.200 --> 32:11.080
We shall retire.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.479
Have you ever laid with a man

32:34.480 --> 32:37.000
after insulting his manhood?

32:39.040 --> 32:42.280
He will pound you to tripe.

33:00.920 --> 33:01.999
What devilment is this?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.799
We're new tenants, sir,

33:03.800 --> 33:06.239
set upon by villains as
we're trying to move in.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.919
She is a filthy bawd.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.439
Our masters don't want her here.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.199
She's a hellcat!

33:13.200 --> 33:15.159
Then your masters will
take it up with her landlord,

33:15.160 --> 33:16.519
or the King of England himself.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.039
But you rogues will move on.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.199
Yeah!

33:19.200 --> 33:21.319
You heard him.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.439
All right, clear
the way, or I'll...

33:23.440 --> 33:25.279
Get out of here.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.719
There's a fine fellow now.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.039
Get out of here,
you piece of shit.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.719
You heard the man.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.799
- Move off.
- Yeah, go home.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.440
Right, let's get this gear off.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.320
Will!

35:06.040 --> 35:07.999
My lady has sent me
to dress you, miss.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.480
One moment, please.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.799
Soaked into the wood.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.560
How long you been down there?

35:46.280 --> 35:48.440
We'll never be free
of the stench.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.999
We haven't got enough beds
or girls to fill the place.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.679
What if I've brought
a scourge upon us?

35:58.680 --> 36:01.039
What if the stench is me?

36:01.040 --> 36:03.320
You have brought
a scourge upon us.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.879
Lydia Quigley.

36:07.880 --> 36:11.040
The stench, that's Mary Cooper.

36:12.840 --> 36:16.679
- I can't do this, Will.
- Well, that's too bad.

36:16.680 --> 36:20.119
This is the course
you set us upon.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.919
The girls will soon awake.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.999
The culls will arrive.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.199
Culls might not come.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.839
In which case,

36:28.840 --> 36:31.680
the lack of beds
will not be a problem.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.959
And once she had got inside,

36:42.960 --> 36:45.639
did Margaret Wells emerge again?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.999
Only her bully man,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.679
draggin' out the sack.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.320
No doubt filled with
what you left them.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.519
You have a better
play than that.

37:00.520 --> 37:05.120
The skill is knowing which
card your adversary holds.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.359
Mr. Osborne is here, Mumma.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.879
It's Mary-Louise's turn
and she's disappeared.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.120
Well, take him to Emily Lacey.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.080
Miss Lacey.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.960
Mr. Osborne for you.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.080
What if nobody co...

38:12.640 --> 38:15.160
The tits come to the lard.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.199
I have no home,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.119
no money,

38:31.120 --> 38:34.840
and I wouldn't care if
only I had my children.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.920
I would rather be dead
than be without them.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.599
If they're slaves,

38:45.600 --> 38:48.319
then surely they're for sale.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.119
You will buy them back.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.479
How?

38:53.480 --> 38:55.399
All I can do

38:55.400 --> 38:58.200
is pay you what
I pay another girl.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.759
I can never be a whore.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.999
A kitchen maid.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.799
Work for me,

39:07.800 --> 39:10.359
and you'll go to bed every
night knowing you have worked.

39:10.360 --> 39:14.080
You forget I was
a slave, Mrs. Wells.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.600
Lucy's home.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.959
The journey from the
country took hours.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.919
You left London?

39:43.920 --> 39:46.159
It was astounding, Ma.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.199
Come now.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.399
Haxby?

39:51.400 --> 39:53.999
Don't let him squirm
off the hook, Howard.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.479
I won't.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.320
Haxby!

40:02.880 --> 40:04.520
I need the piss pot.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.159
I'll summon the maid.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.279
No.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.879
No, I have the piss pot.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.440
What I require is
a menial to hold it.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.480
- Sir?
- Hold my piss pot, Haxby.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.079
You think because
your family have been

40:45.080 --> 40:46.559
with the estate for generations

40:46.560 --> 40:48.359
that I'm forced to endure you,

40:48.360 --> 40:50.400
like an ugly old heirloom.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.879
Meddle again and I'll
kick you out in the street

40:53.880 --> 40:55.639
like a dog.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.199
My wife will snivel
for all of five minutes

40:57.200 --> 40:59.079
and then she'll forget you.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.600
Because a servant
is just a servant.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.079
Hide your faces, harlots!

41:17.080 --> 41:21.879
And damned are the
weak and wayward men

41:21.880 --> 41:26.479
who would indulge
in fornication.

41:26.480 --> 41:33.319
This temple of vice will
burn to its very cinders.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.559
You're welcome here
always, Mr. Armitage,

41:35.560 --> 41:37.040
and at your usual rate.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.079
Less, if you can extract
that eyeless tumor

41:41.080 --> 41:42.399
from the doorstep.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.679
I'm off duty.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.879
And if I don't
have Fanny Lambert

41:44.880 --> 41:45.760
right this moment, I might die

41:45.761 --> 41:48.559
a death of wanting.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.679
She was a treat before.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.079
But in that new dress...

41:53.080 --> 41:56.360
You have buttered
the bacon, Mrs. Wells!

41:59.920 --> 42:02.479
Hide your faces, harlots!

42:02.480 --> 42:04.879
Hide them in very shame.

42:04.880 --> 42:09.919
But the severest
damnation be reserved,

42:09.920 --> 42:12.439
for it is she who provides

42:12.440 --> 42:16.119
both instrument and
opportunity for vice.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.799
Is this how you welcome
your new neighbor,

42:17.800 --> 42:19.159
Mrs. Scanwell?

42:19.160 --> 42:21.159
I bid you no welcome,
flesh-peddler.

42:21.160 --> 42:24.319
Your mistress is also a bawd.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.199
It is Pimp Quigley
that set you upon me,

42:26.200 --> 42:29.479
- is it not?
- God alone is my master.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.999
I am a good Samaritan
here to warn you

42:33.000 --> 42:35.159
that your mistress will
lead you to the bonfire

42:35.160 --> 42:37.679
if you let her.

42:37.680 --> 42:42.800
Her soul is three shades
blacker than your skin.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.879
Mother is fearlessly
fighting your campaign,

42:54.880 --> 42:57.119
but... her health is not strong.

42:57.120 --> 43:00.039
And Mrs. Wells just
mocked us with scorn.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.039
She feasts like a rat
on a corpse pile

43:02.040 --> 43:04.639
but she will become
bloated and complacent.

43:04.640 --> 43:07.359
Do not falter in your
campaign, my dear.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.680
Then we can stay in your house?

43:14.480 --> 43:16.480
What a jewel you are.

43:18.800 --> 43:23.040
Your mother's very
fortunate to have you.

43:40.520 --> 43:43.639
Your mother tells me you play.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.000
I'd love to hear you.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.080
Does your hand trouble you?

44:05.120 --> 44:07.319
No, sir.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.960
Then unfurl it.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.599
Mr. Byrne?

44:25.600 --> 44:27.960
I don't think she likes me.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.480
What's happened?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.360
There's a rotten
smell in here, Ma.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.480
I'm trying to fix it.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.080
Hmph...

46:32.305 --> 46:38.297
