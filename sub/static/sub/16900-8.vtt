- Hey
- Hi, babe.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.925
Dennis, what are you doing?

00:08.090 --> 00:11.220
I'm gonna mount a TV on your wall.
I just can't find a stud.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.847
So you made nine holes
in my wall?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.098
No, those are
for the shelves, dummy.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.643
The TV is gonna go right here.
It's gonna be awesome.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.728
It's gonna be--
It's gonna be like a hospital.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.940
Oh, Dennis,
I don't want a hospital TV.

00:23.106 --> 00:27.440
I don't want a shelf...
Whose horse is that?

00:27.610 --> 00:29.275
That's my cousin Teddy's
Great Dane.

00:29.445 --> 00:30.579
I told him I'd watch him
for a couple weeks.

00:30.738 --> 00:33.958
'cause Teddy broke his ankle
running from some black guys
that pulled a gun on him.

00:34.119 --> 00:36.660
Now, why is it important to tell me
that the muggers were black?

00:36.826 --> 00:38.282
They weren't muggers.
They were cops.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.790
So why don't you just say
he was running from some cops?

00:40.958 --> 00:44.252
I don't know, I mean,
you're a racist for assuming
that they weren't cops.

00:44.416 --> 00:45.671
Uhh!

00:45.838 --> 00:47.253
You know I'm allergic to dogs.

00:47.426 --> 00:51.090
Ack, allergies
are all mental.

00:51.267 --> 00:52.513
Hey.

00:52.675 --> 00:53.593
Who the hell is this?

00:53.768 --> 00:54.972
That's Teddy.

00:55.135 --> 00:57.142
Get out.
I want you out of here!

00:57.307 --> 00:58.723
You can't kick me out.
I love you!

00:58.896 --> 01:00.850
No, no, get your stuff
and get out.

01:01.018 --> 01:02.140
I'm not doing this anymore.

01:02.315 --> 01:04.230
You can't kick me out.
I got squatter's rights.

01:04.396 --> 01:06.441
Which is it: you love me
or you got squatter's rights?

01:06.606 --> 01:08.523
I don't see why
they're mutually exclusive!

01:08.696 --> 01:10.322
Ohh!

01:10.488 --> 01:11.230
Thank you.

01:11.406 --> 01:13.071
Oh, Liz, finally.

01:13.248 --> 01:14.780
It's about time
you broke up with him.

01:14.956 --> 01:16.150
He's a comple loser.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.572
Oh, Jenna, don't say that.

01:17.746 --> 01:20.162
You know, he had
some good moments.

01:20.337 --> 01:21.623
Hi.

01:21.798 --> 01:24.541
I got donuts.

01:24.716 --> 01:28.540
What's up, brown eyes?
I made chili.

01:28.717 --> 01:30.343
Hey...

01:30.506 --> 01:34.842
You wanna...
wanna order cheese steaks?

01:35.227 --> 01:37.091
I guess they were mostly food related.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.303
But he was always nice to me.

01:39.478 --> 01:40.890
Oh, that's okay.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.561
Cry it out, sister.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.601
No, I'm not crying.

01:43.775 --> 01:45.433
I'm allergic
to the stupid Great Dane.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.193
That thing licked
my eyes this morning.

01:47.355 --> 01:48.100
Wait a minute.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.151
Dennis and the dog
are still in your apartment?

01:50.318 --> 01:52.153
I gave him a week
to find a new place.

01:52.327 --> 01:53.073
Ugh.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.153
We're completely broken up.

01:54.326 --> 01:56.900
If that's true, then I'm
taking you out to celebrate.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.161
A girls' night.
We'll meet some new people.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.370
Oh, you mean like
at a discotheque?

02:01.536 --> 02:03.990
Oh, boy.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.648 --> 02:27.560
So when can we
see each other again?

02:27.736 --> 02:29.770
What are you wearing?

02:29.947 --> 02:31.771
Black dress?

02:31.945 --> 02:34.193
Black stockings?

02:34.367 --> 02:35.571
A funeral, oh.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.610
I'm sorry, okay.

02:36.787 --> 02:39.241
Let me call you back
in an hour... yeah, bye.

02:39.408 --> 02:40.200
Why are you cryig?

02:40.366 --> 02:41.872
The Liberty lose again last night?

02:42.037 --> 02:42.743
I'm not crying.

02:42.915 --> 02:43.833
I have allergies.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.411
Allergies are all
in the mind, Lemon.

02:45.588 --> 02:47.000
I use to have a wicked
peanut allergy.

02:47.166 --> 02:50.172
And now, witness.

02:50.756 --> 02:53.591
As I'm sure you surmised from that call,
I'm seeing a woman of late.

02:53.755 --> 02:55.001
Yeah, who's the lucky lady?

02:55.175 --> 02:58.011
Let's just say she's a high-ranking
African-American member of the Bush administration.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.473
Are you dating Condoleeza Rice?

03:01.647 --> 03:03.012
I'm not at liberty to say.

03:03.186 --> 03:06.100
The point is,
my lady friend is an egghead,
much like yourself.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.852
 Not my usual thing,
and I need your advice.

03:09.026 --> 03:10.522
We're having a lot of
trouble connecting lately.

03:10.695 --> 03:11.440
She does a lot of traveling.

03:11.606 --> 03:13.150
Yeah, and it must be hard for
her to get cell phone reception

03:13.315 --> 03:15.861
when she's so far up
the president's butt.

03:16.028 --> 03:19.152
I'm choosing to ignore that remark
on the basis that you are a godless,

03:19.328 --> 03:20.992
glassy-eyed Clintonista.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.281
Now, I wanted to get my friend
something personal.

03:23.456 --> 03:25.871
Do you think she would prefer
this handsome attaché,

03:26.035 --> 03:28.661
which says, "You are a woman of substance,
and I respect you,"

03:28.837 --> 03:29.661
 or...

03:29.837 --> 03:33.080
this collection of ladies' unmentionables
with snaps and openings all over the place?

03:33.257 --> 03:34.291
Attaché!

03:34.466 --> 03:35.843
I see, okay.

03:36.006 --> 03:37.342
Jenna to the floor, please.

03:37.506 --> 03:38.922
Yeah, it's pretty good.

03:39.097 --> 03:40.921
But I think the boobs 
should swing more.

03:41.096 --> 03:44.220
Yeah, then I could go:
Rodney, don't make me come over there

03:44.396 --> 03:47.351
and beat you in the head
with one of my boom-booms!"

03:47.517 --> 03:48.523
Yeah.

03:48.685 --> 03:50.102
This is just appalling.

03:50.275 --> 03:51.603
What's your problem?

03:51.776 --> 03:54.563
I just think it's demeaning
for a black man to do drag.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.321
What? Everybody loves
a dude in a dress.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.110
I mean, those are the best
Bugs Bunnies.

03:59.288 --> 04:01.742
Frank, there are large pockets
of African-American culture

04:01.908 --> 04:03.492
that  Caucasians
know nothing about.

04:03.668 --> 04:05.240
The stigma of drag
is one of them.

04:05.418 --> 04:06.331
Whatever.

04:06.508 --> 04:07.623
I've played a woman before.

04:07.787 --> 04:10.951
 Hunky Grandma Be Trippin'
made $96 million.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.503
All I'm saying is--
is drag is a way for Caucasians

04:14.676 --> 04:17.540
to emasculate you and
make you seem non-threatening.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.671
We never would have stooped
so low on Black Frasier.

04:19.848 --> 04:20.670
Black Frasier?

04:20.848 --> 04:23.722
Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable.

04:23.886 --> 04:26.680
It's both fruity and precocious.

04:26.855 --> 04:32.853
That's not the only thing around here
that's fruity and precocious.

04:33.028 --> 04:34.271
I never heard of Black Frasier.

04:34.447 --> 04:34.601
What?

04:34.776 --> 04:35.943
It was huge on BET.

04:36.105 --> 04:38.902
Every Thursday night
at about 9:00 or 9:15.

04:39.076 --> 04:39.652
Think about it, Tracy.

04:39.825 --> 04:42.821
All the best African-American comedians
refuse to do drag.

04:42.997 --> 04:45.570
Chris Rock doesn't do it.
Dr. Cosby doesn't do it.

04:45.747 --> 04:49.741
Bernie Mac doesn't do it
'cause he'd be ugly as hell.

04:49.918 --> 04:50.992
Forget it.

04:51.166 --> 04:55.250
I'm not wearing this dress.
It's prejudicial.

04:55.427 --> 04:55.960
Thanks a lot.

04:56.128 --> 04:58.293
Now what am I supposed to do
with this sketch?

04:58.468 --> 04:59.460
I'll do it.

04:59.636 --> 05:05.222
I mean, my parents raised me
as a girl for, like, ten years.

05:05.517 --> 05:08.973
What?
I told you guys that.

05:09.146 --> 05:10.472
That's our show for tonight!

05:10.646 --> 05:11.970
See you next week!

05:12.148 --> 05:14.810
Good night!

05:18.565 --> 05:21.572
That's okay,
we'll think of something.

05:21.737 --> 05:23.613
All right, I'll see you.

05:23.788 --> 05:24.991
Monday night
is girls' night.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.911
I'm taking you out, 9:30.

05:27.078 --> 05:30.121
I know this great karaoke place
where you can get a pedicure while you sing.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.372
Oh, Jenna,
I'll go anywhere.

05:31.547 --> 05:34.501
Just,  please, no more karaoke.
Not after our last duet.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.833
When I'm right here,
you need to be here.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.000
Not here.
Here is embarrassing.

05:40.170 --> 05:40.505
Okay, fine.

05:40.675 --> 05:42.639
I didn't say that.
I said you're a beautiful woman.

05:42.808 --> 05:44.888
It wouldn't hurt to try
something different with your hair.

05:45.059 --> 05:45.473
Check this out.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.840
I think Jack
is dating Condi Rice.

05:48.016 --> 05:49.762
Oh, God, that's huge!

05:49.936 --> 05:53.222
Oh, no, no.
I never said braces.
I said bonding.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.602
Dude, that Shamanda character
was the best thing of the night..

05:55.776 --> 05:57.522
What was her line?
Say it again.

05:57.696 --> 05:59.650
Rodney!

05:59.817 --> 06:05.693
Don't make me come over there
and beat on you with my boom-booms!

06:07.286 --> 06:08.281
You burned me!

06:08.458 --> 06:11.582
There's nothing wrong
with a black comedian wearing a dress.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.293
Eddie does it, Martin does it,
Jamie Foxx, Flip Wilson.

06:15.455 --> 06:17.623
Whoopi Goldberg does it every day!

06:17.797 --> 06:19.213
You stole
a franchise from me!

06:19.375 --> 06:23.340
Shamanda could have been a movie!

06:23.557 --> 06:25.841
Okay, you need to write
something great for him

06:26.018 --> 06:27.760
before this becomes
a problem.

06:27.937 --> 06:30.591
I wouldn't even know where to begin
writing for a guy like that.

06:30.768 --> 06:34.562
Then write something with him.

06:39.778 --> 06:41.812
Our comedy gotta do more
than make people laugh.

06:41.987 --> 06:44.071
Gotta make people think.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.981
I wanna hold a mirror up to society,

06:46.158 --> 06:48.953
and then win world record
for biggest mirror.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.110
He's totally right.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.781
Gotta be raw!

06:52.955 --> 06:53.281
Uh-huh.

06:53.457 --> 06:56.082
I got a concept for a sketch
I think you might like.

06:56.258 --> 06:59.410
You and Jenna play Sleestaks
from Land of the Lost

06:59.588 --> 07:01.542
and you're trying to get
a small business loan.

07:01.716 --> 07:02.212
What?

07:02.386 --> 07:08.261
Because you want to
open up a pancake house
called Slee's Stacks.

07:09.518 --> 07:12.340
Are you black?

07:19.397 --> 07:20.691
Jack, is everything all right?

07:20.855 --> 07:24.062
I think I figured out why things have been
so rocky with my lady friend.

07:24.237 --> 07:26.362
I'm on the street.
I can barely hear you.

07:26.535 --> 07:28.401
She's cheating on me, Liz.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.242
I think there's another man
in the picture.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.411
Are you sure, Jack?

07:32.576 --> 07:36.240
'Cause she kind of seems
like an honest lady.

07:36.418 --> 07:38.452
I know what I know.

07:38.628 --> 07:43.131
Next time I see Putin,
I'm gonna kick his teeth in.

07:43.295 --> 07:44.590
Oh, here it is!

07:44.757 --> 07:45.213
Izzle.

07:45.386 --> 07:48.133
"A suffix that can be used
to take the place of anything."

07:48.307 --> 07:50.342
Well, now you're just
being patronizzle.

07:50.516 --> 07:51.882
You know who would
love this argument?

07:52.058 --> 07:55.390
My racist grandfather.

07:56.146 --> 07:59.522
I thought writing with you was gonna be
like two brothers writing together.

07:59.685 --> 08:01.563
We're not even speaking
the same language.

08:01.736 --> 08:02.190
That's right.

08:02.355 --> 08:03.191
I'm speaking English.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.273
Just listen,
just listen.

08:04.448 --> 08:06.192
 Come on, who raised you?

08:06.365 --> 08:08.282
Standing there
with your pants that fit.

08:08.445 --> 08:10.991
Using a wallet.
Drinking Starbucks.

08:11.155 --> 08:12.242
And what is this?

08:12.405 --> 08:14.492
That's my Harvard a capella
group the Crocodillos.

08:14.665 --> 08:16.203
I had a solo
in Like A Prayer.

08:16.376 --> 08:18.290
Come on!
Where's your heritage?

08:18.457 --> 08:20.831
My brother!
My homeboy!

08:21.008 --> 08:23.373
My n--

08:27.047 --> 08:29.002
Hey, sorry I'm late.

08:29.177 --> 08:29.801
Thank God you're here.

08:29.966 --> 08:31.472
This place is creeping me out.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.592
I don't think I can do this.

08:32.767 --> 08:35.890
You're gonna be great.
They're cute.

08:36.056 --> 08:37.471
Do  you think
they're Wall Street guys?

08:37.647 --> 08:42.183
Yeah, I think they're from the firm of Date-Rape,
Coke-ington Cheeseball, and Jag.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.482
You've got to give this a chance.

08:44.655 --> 08:47.151
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

08:47.316 --> 08:50.652
Oh, really, dude?
I gotta move my coat?

08:50.826 --> 08:53.990
There's like four empty seats down there.
Can't you just be cool?

08:54.157 --> 08:56.413
Ugh.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.530
That guy wanted
to buy you a drink.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.453
Really?

08:59.628 --> 09:01.162
I already have a drink.

09:01.338 --> 09:02.700
Do you think he'd buy me
mozzarella sticks?

09:02.877 --> 09:04.332
What is the matter with you?

09:04.506 --> 09:07.250
I don't know!
I'm just nervous and rusty.

09:07.427 --> 09:10.213
Well, just relax
and be yourself.

09:10.388 --> 09:14.341
Can I have a martini, please?
Hi.

09:15.017 --> 09:18.721
Oh, he knows where
Bin Laden is, come on!

09:18.895 --> 09:20.971
The Carlyle Group.
The Unocal Pipeline.

09:21.148 --> 09:22.892
The assassination
of Olof Palme.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.733
Come on, the proof
is in the pudding.

09:25.897 --> 09:26.851
Ooh, these are good.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.482
Really, you think she looks
like Jessica Simpson?

09:29.657 --> 09:33.191
You could put a long, blonde wig on a ferret
and it would like Jessica Simpson.

09:33.367 --> 09:37.451
And by the way, Jessica Simpson would think
that you are old and gross.

09:37.616 --> 09:39.160
 So good luck with that.

09:39.327 --> 09:41.581
I really didn't think
I was gonna meet anybody tonight,

09:41.745 --> 09:45.963
but you and I have
so much in common.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.253
Also, you have really pretty eyes.
Oh, hi.

09:49.426 --> 09:55.760
I learned the truth at seventeen.
That love was meant for beauty queens.

09:56.807 --> 09:57.842
Hey, you're bumming us out.

09:58.017 --> 10:01.431
And high school girls
with clear skin smiles.

10:01.606 --> 10:04.732
Who married young and then retired.

10:04.898 --> 10:07.140
Whoa

10:09.946 --> 10:11.573
I thought bars were open till 4:00.

10:11.737 --> 10:15.782
Nope, 11:30.
Let's get you to bed.

10:18.497 --> 10:20.241
... from human resources.

10:20.416 --> 10:21.243
Hi.

10:21.416 --> 10:24.452
He told me that Toofer filed
the harassment complaint against Tracy.

10:24.626 --> 10:25.413
What?

10:25.587 --> 10:27.871
Now I have to attend 
sensitivity training.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.671
What seems to be
the problem, Toofer?

10:29.835 --> 10:33.921
Mr. Jordan called me...
the N-word.

10:35.556 --> 10:36.422
And?

10:36.596 --> 10:38.220
And I was really offended.

10:38.386 --> 10:40.142
Because...

10:40.305 --> 10:41.970
Because it's a racial slur.

10:42.147 --> 10:44.353
Brothers talk
to other brothers like that.

10:44.526 --> 10:45.682
I was being friendly.

10:45.856 --> 10:47.023
  Yes, Toofer.

10:47.187 --> 10:50.401
You see, in the last decade or so
the African-American community

10:50.567 --> 10:54.900
has re-appropriated that word
as a way of depriving it of its meaning.

10:55.075 --> 10:57.573
Just don't try to tell
my girlfriend that.

10:57.805 --> 11:02.203
Yeah, Toofer, I really don't think
Tracy was trying to offend you.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.283
It's okay for us
to use it with each other.

11:04.456 --> 11:09.333
You can call me that.
It's a term of endearment.

11:11.177 --> 11:13.751
Look, I'm not trying
to cause any trouble.

11:13.928 --> 11:16.301
And I confess I appreciate
what you do for the show.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.880
I want you to be my brother,
my homeboy, my n--

11:20.058 --> 11:21.973
Whoa!

11:22.145 --> 11:22.893
This meeting is adjourned.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.182
No cool, homie!

11:24.358 --> 11:26.102
You might as well spread me
down with a fire hose.

11:26.275 --> 11:28.643
Just sounds so hateful
coming from you! Ugh!

11:28.817 --> 11:32.443
I wish to file a complaint.

11:35.197 --> 11:36.281
Hey.

11:36.447 --> 11:37.990
Dennis, what are you doing here?

11:38.157 --> 11:39.741
Hey, I'm moving into
my new apartment.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.111
So I got one last thing
to say to you,

11:42.285 --> 11:46.793
and then I'll be
out of your life forever.

11:47.376 --> 11:48.793
"Dear Liz Lemon,

11:48.957 --> 11:51.581
"While other women
have bigger boobs than you,

11:51.755 --> 11:53.920
"no woman has
as big a heart.

11:54.087 --> 11:55.500
"When I saw you getting ready to go out

11:55.677 --> 11:57.503
"and get nailed by a bunch
of guys last night,

11:57.676 --> 11:59.630
"I knew for sure
it was over between us.

11:59.805 --> 12:04.341
"And for the first time
since the '86 World Series, I cried".

12:04.518 --> 12:06.432
"I cried like a big dumb homo".

12:06.606 --> 12:09.890
"And if it was up to me,
we would be together forever.

12:10.068 --> 12:12.902
"But there's a new thing
called 'women's liberation'

12:13.067 --> 12:14.611
"which gives you women
the right to choose,

12:14.778 --> 12:15.942
"and you have chosen to abort me.

12:16.116 --> 12:17.941
"And that I must live with.

12:18.115 --> 12:20.823
"So tonight when you arrive
home, I'll be gone.

12:20.997 --> 12:25.702
I officially renounced
my squatter's rights."

12:26.625 --> 12:28.450
I'll always love you.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.952
Good-bye and good luck.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.460
I'll never forget you.

12:36.426 --> 12:39.710
And that is why
we are no longer a couple.

12:39.887 --> 12:41.762
The guy just came in here
and bared his soul to you.

12:41.925 --> 12:44.471
What are you, made of stone?

12:44.647 --> 12:46.891
Am I crazy?
The guy's a disaster, right?

12:47.055 --> 12:47.932
Well, I don't know.

12:48.105 --> 12:49.773
I mean, yeah, he's a little
"bridge and tunnel,"

12:49.937 --> 12:52.311
but you did say
you had some good times.

12:52.488 --> 12:55.400
No, no, no, he had
his bad moments too.

12:55.565 --> 12:56.942
Hey.

12:57.118 --> 12:57.940
Threesome?

12:58.117 --> 12:59.361
How about it, huh?

12:59.535 --> 13:01.071
Mmm!

13:01.245 --> 13:02.033
I'm just saying...

13:02.198 --> 13:03.650
after last night...

13:03.826 --> 13:06.322
maybe he's not such
a bad choice.

13:06.498 --> 13:08.831
You are suggesting
that I get back with Dennis.

13:08.998 --> 13:09.830
Maybe.

13:09.998 --> 13:10.950
Look, you're a writer.

13:11.127 --> 13:13.211
Write a list of Dennis'
pros and cons.

13:13.378 --> 13:15.082
It's a very helpful exercise.

13:15.256 --> 13:17.332
It's how I decided
to get a scooter instead of a bike.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.673
Ah.

13:21.265 --> 13:23.013
Well, you have to admit
there's always time for Tony Blair.

13:23.176 --> 13:24.762
There's always time
for Bashar al-Assad.

13:24.937 --> 13:28.973
But there's never any time for Jack Donaghy,
and that's a problem.

13:29.145 --> 13:32.933
Go ahead, take the call, yeah.

13:34.487 --> 13:36.443
Hey, Dennis, you drop by
to say hi to Liz?

13:36.606 --> 13:38.773
You mean the ex-future Mrs. Dennis?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.152
She dumped me again.

13:40.327 --> 13:41.533
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:41.697 --> 13:45.532
Yeah, you know, you try to make some people happy,
but it doesn't work all the time.

13:45.708 --> 13:46.952
Tell me about it.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.322
What, you?

13:48.498 --> 13:50.032
I really can't go into detail.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.792
It's about when my woman
and I are together,

13:51.958 --> 13:55.502
it's mindblowing.
It's, uh...

13:55.668 --> 13:56.622
It's filthy, really.

13:56.797 --> 13:57.422
So what's the problem?

13:57.585 --> 13:58.253
Well, she works all the time.

13:58.425 --> 13:59.710
She's always traveling,
it's a headache.

13:59.887 --> 14:00.713
Who needs that?

14:00.888 --> 14:02.462
That's why I'm always dating 20-year-olds.

14:02.637 --> 14:04.883
Nah, let me tell you about
20-year-olds, my friend.

14:05.056 --> 14:07.970
Half of them are 16.
You want some advice?

14:08.145 --> 14:10.853
It's hard for alpha males like you and me
to put our egos aside,

14:11.016 --> 14:13.020
but if she's worth it,
you make it work.

14:13.188 --> 14:15.351
It's like my cousin Teddy's dog.

14:15.528 --> 14:17.850
Sometimes he just
doesn't wanna lick my feet.

14:18.026 --> 14:21.571
So what I do is,
I hide my feet from him for a couple of days,

14:21.737 --> 14:24.192
and then when he sees them,
he goes bananas.

14:24.366 --> 14:28.820
So Jack, in this example,
Liz is the dog.

14:29.288 --> 14:31.121
And I am my feet.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.703
You see what I'm saying?

14:33.877 --> 14:36.041
Yes, I believe I do.

14:36.217 --> 14:39.713
Each of you is here because
you are insensitive to a co-worker, okay?

14:39.887 --> 14:43.553
You might've used one of the words
I call the "uh-oh" words.

14:43.715 --> 14:45.923
Such as, slut.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.882
Ho.

14:48.056 --> 14:49.263
Uh, bitch.

14:49.437 --> 14:50.973
Biyatch.

14:51.147 --> 14:52.353
Queerburger.

14:52.518 --> 14:53.762
Faggotron.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.523
Gaybird.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.600
Uh, the word for black
in any language,

14:57.775 --> 15:02.153
Néro, noir, schwartz,
negro, kam-an-sek.

15:03.118 --> 15:03.773
Hmm?

15:03.947 --> 15:06.240
So.
What else?

15:06.408 --> 15:08.570
What else can we not call
each other?

15:08.746 --> 15:10.032
How 'bout sweaty greaseball?

15:10.208 --> 15:11.990
Ooh, very good.
That's highly offensive.

15:12.168 --> 15:14.282
Person of color.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.370
Guess if you say it like that.

15:16.547 --> 15:19.291
Sneaky Taiwanese tranny
who stole my watch.

15:19.465 --> 15:22.130
Ho-ho!
Yes!

15:22.505 --> 15:24.293
These words are terrible.

15:24.468 --> 15:28.381
But today, we are going
to learn to communicate in a different way.

15:28.555 --> 15:33.391
And I would like to start
with Tracy and James.

15:33.805 --> 15:34.761
Guys?

15:34.938 --> 15:38.733
Now, I understand that the two of you
got into a big 'ol conflict yesterday.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.152
And...let's work this out.
Tracy.

15:42.315 --> 15:44.403
What did you really want
to say to James?

15:44.576 --> 15:46.282
I'm tryin' to tell him
he's my brother.

15:46.448 --> 15:47.403
We're the only two blacks 
on the show.

15:47.578 --> 15:49.281
We have to figure out
a way to work together.

15:49.445 --> 15:53.623
Like professor Martin Luther King said,
I have a feeling.

15:53.786 --> 15:59.540
It's Dr. Martin Luther King,
and he did not have a feeling,
he had a dream.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.290
Ah, dude wear khakis.

16:01.468 --> 16:03.002
Uncle Tom,
party of one.

16:03.177 --> 16:04.880
Uncle Tom,
party of one.

16:05.046 --> 16:07.751
You can't call someone that
if you've never read the book!

16:07.927 --> 16:08.920
What  book?

16:09.097 --> 16:10.223
You know what I think?

16:10.385 --> 16:13.643
I think you're ashamed of being black,
and you're an embarrassment to your community!

16:13.807 --> 16:14.802
I embarrass you.

16:14.978 --> 16:16.722
You embarrass me,
and you know why?

16:16.907 --> 16:19.271
Because there are racist people
in this world,

16:19.438 --> 16:23.650
and when they see you
act like a fool,
they assume we're all fools.

16:23.815 --> 16:26.480
That's it!
This is it.

16:26.655 --> 16:28.233
This is the sketch we should do.

16:28.406 --> 16:28.901
What?

16:29.076 --> 16:30.860
Right here, you and me!

16:31.036 --> 16:34.572
This is deep stuff goin' on.
We gotta write this.

16:34.747 --> 16:35.533
You're right.

16:35.705 --> 16:37.371
Ah-ha-ha!

16:37.538 --> 16:38.790
Dr. Snoo,
thank you very much!

16:38.958 --> 16:39.162
Smew.

16:39.336 --> 16:41.710
Oh. Oh.
Okay.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.462
That's really against the rules.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.050
Dennis?

16:53.975 --> 16:56.643
Oh, my God.

17:04.657 --> 17:10.569
"I know this might be emotional for you,
so there's a meatball sub in the fridge."

17:10.734 --> 17:12.901
Oh!

17:19.876 --> 17:22.829
"Pro.
Fixed TV."

17:26.175 --> 17:28.421
Huh.

17:29.136 --> 17:30.713
Hello, I'm Star Jones.

17:30.887 --> 17:35.131
And welcome to the Star Jones
Gastric Bypass Cooking Show.

17:35.308 --> 17:36.932
Mmm.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.140
Liz, what happened to the race
relations sketch Tracy and I wrote?

17:40.316 --> 17:44.022
Oh, we only had time for one more bit,
and Tracy picked this. I'm sorry.

17:44.187 --> 17:48.813
Now you know,
I can only eat small portions.

17:49.907 --> 17:53.400
Oh, my goodness!
Dessert.

17:56.868 --> 18:00.910
Okay, he's right,
this is funnier.

18:11.426 --> 18:14.510
- Guess where I was last night.
- Mark Foley's pajama party.

18:14.675 --> 18:16.011
No.

18:16.188 --> 18:16.933
Kandahar.

18:17.096 --> 18:17.890
Afghanistan?

18:18.056 --> 18:18.262
Yeah.

18:18.435 --> 18:21.561
Took the corporate jet to hook up
with my neo-con inamorata.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.020
Well, I'm glad things are working out
for you and your mystery lady.

18:25.185 --> 18:25.982
Well actually, they're not.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.312
I broke up with her.

18:27.486 --> 18:28.152
Really?

18:28.317 --> 18:28.853
What happened?

18:29.026 --> 18:30.521
Well, I finally realized
that we're not compatible.

18:30.698 --> 18:33.691
I mean, I'm all for fantasy
role-play, but Abu-Ghraib?

18:33.865 --> 18:35.611
Well, you know, relationships end.

18:35.785 --> 18:37.033
People...move on.

18:37.207 --> 18:39.073
But I'm glad at least
I gave it a shot.

18:39.245 --> 18:41.953
Thank Dennis
for making me do that.

18:42.128 --> 18:42.782
Dennis?

18:42.958 --> 18:43.910
Yep.

18:44.086 --> 18:46.410
You know, I might've been
too hard on that guy.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.173
He's okay.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.592
Hmm.

18:54.848 --> 18:57.972
"Jack likes Dennis.

18:59.845 --> 19:03.060
"Jack likes Dennis."

19:07.278 --> 19:12.362
At Snapple, when young fruit ripens,
they may want to combine with other fruit.

19:12.525 --> 19:14.693
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:14.867 --> 19:17.571
I just, um, just wanted to drop off
your Christmas present.

19:17.748 --> 19:19.402
I had already bought it
for you, so...

19:19.575 --> 19:20.451
Oh...

19:20.617 --> 19:23.990
It's a fancy briefcase, you know,
'cause you're classy and important.

19:24.168 --> 19:25.371
Like a dude.

19:25.545 --> 19:26.373
Thank you, Dennis.

19:26.547 --> 19:29.462
I, uh, also got you some antihistamine.

19:29.625 --> 19:33.172
In case the next guy you're with,
you know, has a dog
and you wanna stay with him.

19:33.345 --> 19:35.630
Anyway.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.840
Do wanna eat?

19:38.016 --> 19:38.673
What?

19:38.848 --> 19:39.800
I got all this Chinese food.

19:39.975 --> 19:42.553
I'm never gonna finish it
by myself, so...

19:42.725 --> 19:45.263
For real?

19:48.065 --> 19:49.231
Should I, um,
grab a plate?

19:49.398 --> 19:50.730
Yeah.
Get me a diet soda.

19:50.895 --> 19:53.193
Okay.

19:55.488 --> 19:57.481
Good evening and welcome
to Dateline.

19:57.658 --> 20:00.450
Chris Hansen has our latest investigation--

20:00.617 --> 20:02.992
Hello?

20:03.747 --> 20:04.241
Good evening, sir.

20:04.418 --> 20:06.290
I'm Chris Hansen
with Dateline NBC.

20:06.457 --> 20:08.330
Can I ask you what
you're doing here tonight?

20:08.506 --> 20:10.373
Oh, yeah, I'm here to boff
some chick named Mary.

20:10.546 --> 20:11.252
Boff some chick--

20:11.425 --> 20:12.292
Oh, my God.

20:12.468 --> 20:13.711
Do you know how old Mary is?

20:13.887 --> 20:16.041
Yeah, uh, 22.
I think.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.253
You wanna try again?

20:17.426 --> 20:19.212
Crap.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.180
That girl said she was 16,
but I swear to God
I could tell she was 22.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.762
Get out of my apartment!

20:24.935 --> 20:26.563
This happened while
we were broken up.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.060
No, no, no, no.
I was right about you!

20:29.226 --> 20:33.020
This is a con, by the way.
You on Dateline is a con!

20:33.195 --> 20:33.851
You know what?

20:34.026 --> 20:34.980
I knew you wouldn't be cool about this.

20:35.156 --> 20:35.981
We're finished.

20:36.157 --> 20:38.403
You can't break up with me.
I already broke up with you!

20:38.577 --> 20:38.863
Fine!

20:39.038 --> 20:42.572
Then we agree to disagree!

20:43.305 --> 20:49.722
