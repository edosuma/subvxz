WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:04.256
I'm gonna be, like, the
ambassador of the human race.

00:04.281 --> 00:05.445
Got my date wrong.

00:05.470 --> 00:07.991
I need some space, but
let's still be friends.

00:08.016 --> 00:09.983
- I need you all to leave.
- He's kicking us out.

00:09.985 --> 00:11.951
I still want to hire
you for this position.

00:11.953 --> 00:13.024
I'm going back to New York.

00:13.048 --> 00:15.289
You can't run from this forever, Ozzie.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.085
Empathy.

00:18.275 --> 00:20.105
Gina is Empathy.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.398
What are you doing?

00:28.423 --> 00:31.054
Shut up. I'm on a date.

00:31.891 --> 00:33.625
You've met someone?

00:33.773 --> 00:35.006
That's great!

00:35.008 --> 00:38.257
That's not... No. It's for the mission.

00:38.282 --> 00:39.546
Of course.

00:39.578 --> 00:41.092
You know, Nancy, you...

00:41.117 --> 00:43.814
really know how to
show a guy a good time.

00:43.816 --> 00:45.390
And...

00:46.739 --> 00:48.312
thanks for paying for dinner.

00:48.337 --> 00:49.670
My pleasure.

00:49.781 --> 00:52.468
I'm definitely gonna
check out Ayn Rand's stuff.

00:52.493 --> 00:54.304
She sounds so interesting.

00:54.476 --> 00:56.676
- Ayn. It's pronounced...
- Ayn.

00:56.701 --> 00:59.124
You should get people's names right.

00:59.149 --> 01:00.289
Well...

01:00.384 --> 01:03.054
"Ayn" having a very good time tonight.

01:04.358 --> 01:06.593
So, what else can you
tell me about Gina?

01:07.397 --> 01:09.678
I think I pretty much
covered everything.

01:09.711 --> 01:11.453
You know, her likes, her dislikes,

01:11.478 --> 01:13.468
how we met, where she lives.

01:13.493 --> 01:15.554
- And there's nothing else...
- I should know?

01:15.811 --> 01:18.007
Okay. Yeah.

01:18.108 --> 01:20.427
I think I know what's going on here.

01:20.452 --> 01:22.466
- You do?
- Listen.

01:22.491 --> 01:25.529
There is nothing going
on between me and Gina.

01:25.554 --> 01:29.469
I mean, yes, I've always thought
she had a crush on me, but...

01:29.628 --> 01:31.394
she is not my type.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.040
You are.

01:35.911 --> 01:38.511
- What do I do?
- Kiss him!

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.756 --> 01:49.421
Look, I really...

01:49.608 --> 01:51.772
I'm tempted to invite you in right now,

01:51.797 --> 01:54.544
but I'm... I'm still transitioning

01:54.569 --> 01:57.757
from divorced guy to single guy, so...

01:57.893 --> 02:00.277
Very well. Good night.

02:00.302 --> 02:02.452
I'll see you at StarCrossed tomorrow.

02:03.004 --> 02:04.742
I look forward to it.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.334
She's the one.

02:20.359 --> 02:23.726
I've gathered useful intel
on Empathy from this asset.

02:24.023 --> 02:26.090
Empathy? You mean...

02:26.092 --> 02:28.116
The woman who killed Kurt.

02:29.054 --> 02:30.585
Sweet Kurt.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.858
I'm gonna use his knowledge

02:32.883 --> 02:35.374
to make her death as
painful as possible.

02:35.399 --> 02:38.007
That doesn't sound like it's on-mission.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.897
I'll humiliate Empathy, and
then I'll put an end to her.

02:41.922 --> 02:44.085
It'll be clean. Efficient.

02:44.596 --> 02:47.537
Maybe we should just talk about
this before you do anything.

02:47.562 --> 02:49.234
I'm done talking.

02:49.259 --> 02:51.164
Now is the time for action.

02:56.226 --> 02:58.265
Mom, you didn't have to do all this.

02:58.290 --> 03:01.999
Well, I'm just so glad
to have you back in town.

03:02.459 --> 03:05.693
You've got a new job
at The New York Times.

03:05.695 --> 03:08.696
Safe. Stable. Prestigious.

03:08.698 --> 03:11.529
Next thing you know,
you'll meet someone.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.988
Maybe like that nice girl you
dated who was with the circus.

03:15.013 --> 03:16.193
She wasn't in the circus, Mom.

03:16.217 --> 03:19.527
She was a yoga teacher
who had a nose ring.

03:19.552 --> 03:21.889
Hey, Mom, do you know where
my Social Security card

03:21.914 --> 03:23.238
and birth certificate are?

03:23.263 --> 03:24.634
You're a grown man.

03:24.659 --> 03:26.138
You should know where
your documents are.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.381
I do. I have copies.

03:27.406 --> 03:29.584
I just... I leave the originals here.

03:29.586 --> 03:32.209
I leave everything that's
important here, so it's safe.

03:32.225 --> 03:34.121
I gave all that stuff to your father.

03:34.123 --> 03:36.795
- He has more storage space at his place.
- What? No...

03:37.325 --> 03:39.473
Ozzie, relax. He's not that bad.

03:39.498 --> 03:41.927
That's easy for you to
say. You got to divorce him.

03:43.102 --> 03:45.869
I did not expect to have
to have an awkward time

03:45.871 --> 03:47.810
at Uncle Daddy's house today.

03:49.927 --> 03:52.976
- Doug?
- Hey. Chelsea.

03:52.978 --> 03:54.342
What can I do for you?

03:54.367 --> 03:56.451
I wanted to see how you were doing.

03:56.476 --> 03:58.146
I'm fine, thank you.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.621
Are you, um... are you going somewhere?

04:01.646 --> 04:04.427
Yes. I'm taking a vacation.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.162
After all the stuff that happened,

04:06.187 --> 04:09.052
I just, um... need a
little time to think.

04:09.108 --> 04:12.109
- Because of the kidnapping?
- Yes. And other stuff.

04:12.111 --> 04:13.743
Where are you going?

04:13.745 --> 04:15.452
The Bronze Star Inn.

04:15.477 --> 04:16.576
In Schenectady.

04:16.601 --> 04:17.795
By the outlet mall?

04:17.820 --> 04:19.849
I was in a band a long time ago.

04:19.874 --> 04:21.576
Operation Mongoose.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.967
No way.

04:24.269 --> 04:26.623
My gosh.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.340
- Look at you!
- Yeah.

04:28.365 --> 04:30.794
Guess who's getting the
band back together again.

04:30.826 --> 04:32.412
Wow.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.967
It's happening.

04:37.351 --> 04:40.447
Pretend you just ordered
some nice, steamy pizza.

04:40.472 --> 04:43.990
The delivery guy's on his
way up the walk, then bam!

04:44.015 --> 04:45.442
Gets bit by a dog.

04:45.444 --> 04:47.199
- We don't have a dog.
- It doesn't matter.

04:47.224 --> 04:48.731
It was on your property.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.214
Does home insurance cover it? No.

04:51.216 --> 04:53.263
Life insurance? Nope.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.560
Umbrella insurance covers everything.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.482
Maybe we should get it.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.806
Maybe you should.

05:00.831 --> 05:03.779
It's like putting bubble
wrap around all your worries.

05:03.992 --> 05:06.724
Plus you get one of these bad boys.

05:09.168 --> 05:10.534
Where do we sign?

05:10.559 --> 05:12.269
It's been an eventful couple of weeks.

05:12.294 --> 05:14.506
Let's... let's just do the...

05:14.907 --> 05:15.967
Kelly, what are you doing?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.608
I'm... I'm lounging.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.253
It's... it's a lounge.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.327
Right. Can you do that
without your shoes on, please?

05:21.351 --> 05:23.584
Can we not meet in a store?

05:23.609 --> 05:25.138
Sorry we're late.

05:25.163 --> 05:26.918
We were carpooling.

05:26.943 --> 05:28.420
Is that what the kids call it?

05:28.445 --> 05:29.663
- Okay, great.
- Hi guys.

05:29.688 --> 05:30.889
Um, come on in.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.981
Let's see. Guys, we really do
have to be out of the store by 9:45.

05:34.006 --> 05:36.217
Is everyone really clear on
the concept of a hard out?

05:36.242 --> 05:38.693
- 'Cause I can't...
- Yes. We are clear on that.

05:38.718 --> 05:39.756
- Let's begin.
- No.

05:39.781 --> 05:41.678
No, actually, we can't begin, because...

05:41.703 --> 05:45.099
Nancy still doesn't have all of
her introduction materials, so...

05:45.124 --> 05:48.498
Um, right, okay. Um...

05:50.162 --> 05:51.341
Here's your binder. Pick a sponsor.

05:51.365 --> 05:52.765
Don't make a whole thing out of it.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.224
I've got all the time in the world...

05:55.249 --> 05:56.782
murderer.

05:56.807 --> 05:58.982
I'll be your sponsor, Nancy.

05:59.797 --> 06:01.564
There you go.

06:05.489 --> 06:06.959
Don?

06:07.259 --> 06:10.482
Yeah. H-hi, Jonathan.

06:10.842 --> 06:12.662
What is happening right now?

06:12.664 --> 06:15.084
Why are you working in a coffee shop?

06:15.623 --> 06:17.584
It's related to the mission.

06:17.609 --> 06:19.177
It's the truth.

06:20.014 --> 06:22.181
It's not. It's not.

06:22.464 --> 06:23.764
I'm lying.

06:23.789 --> 06:27.170
Can we talk by the milk station?

06:30.835 --> 06:32.661
Wow, that's a lovely scarf.

06:32.686 --> 06:34.881
No, don't change the subject.

06:34.906 --> 06:36.271
Does Jeff know you work here?

06:36.296 --> 06:39.099
Technically, no... no.

06:39.124 --> 06:40.850
But don't... please don't tell him.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.926
Who am I gonna tell? I went rogue.

06:42.928 --> 06:44.998
Yeah. I didn't want to bring it up,

06:45.023 --> 06:47.030
but I heard through the grapevine.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.467
Sorry about that.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.633
No. Not at all.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.662
I'm enjoying my new-found freedom.

06:51.687 --> 06:54.334
I'm out there in the world, you know?

06:55.073 --> 06:57.068
But hey, listen, I'm a
little strapped for cash.

06:57.093 --> 06:59.491
Could you get me an iced
mocha macchiato on the house?

06:59.515 --> 07:00.948
- Of course.
- Cool.

07:01.194 --> 07:03.727
And maybe... could
you give me your tips?

07:03.752 --> 07:05.897
Okay, so, how...

07:05.922 --> 07:07.865
how was your week, Richard?

07:08.167 --> 07:11.943
Well, there was this one incident.

07:13.631 --> 07:16.140
Hey, Richard. There's a long-distance
call for you on line two.

07:16.142 --> 07:17.155
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

07:17.179 --> 07:19.272
I couldn't understand it.
They were speaking Klingon.

07:20.359 --> 07:22.490
Like a Klingon would use a landline.

07:22.548 --> 07:24.525
So how'd that make you feel?

07:24.550 --> 07:26.168
Okay, I can't process things

07:26.193 --> 07:28.379
when you're rushing along my healing.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.452
Well, to be clear, I'm rushing
through everyone's healing.

07:30.476 --> 07:31.933
Okay, Kelly, your turn to share.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.058
Um, I feel like your
energy's a little too, like,

07:34.060 --> 07:35.723
overwhelmed-grad-student right now.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.324
Is there a way that we could do this

07:37.349 --> 07:40.164
another time and place
that's not so rushed?

07:40.166 --> 07:42.935
I'm working on it. Nothing
has come through yet.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.098
Sorry. Nancy, I'm sorry.

07:45.123 --> 07:47.004
Things aren't normally this chaotic.

07:47.006 --> 07:48.738
My offer still stands.

07:48.763 --> 07:50.881
We could meet up tonight at my barn.

07:50.906 --> 07:52.863
It would have to be,
like, you know, 7:30.

07:52.888 --> 07:55.045
- I still got to feed the cows.
- Sure, let's meet up there.

07:55.047 --> 07:56.457
Sounds murder-y. I like it.

07:56.482 --> 07:57.615
The store opens in five minutes.

07:57.617 --> 07:59.482
Can you do me a favor and
just pick up your trash?

07:59.506 --> 08:01.429
And if you'd please put the
pillows around and distribute them,

08:01.453 --> 08:02.662
I'd be really grateful.

08:02.998 --> 08:04.818
- Check the alarm.
- I'm not going out the back.

08:04.842 --> 08:07.145
Go out the back. Check the alarm, guys.

08:07.147 --> 08:09.948
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.

08:12.185 --> 08:13.852
Dad, are you home?

08:14.513 --> 08:17.693
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.

08:17.795 --> 08:18.757
- Dad?
- Nam myoho...

08:18.759 --> 08:21.443
- Hey, Dad?
- Renge kyo. Nam myoho...

08:23.295 --> 08:24.717
You can join me if you want.

08:24.742 --> 08:26.642
No. I'm good.

08:34.763 --> 08:36.975
Ozzie! My man!

08:37.576 --> 08:39.856
Okay. All right.

08:40.285 --> 08:43.051
Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad.

08:43.116 --> 08:45.974
So, when did you become a Buddhist?

08:45.999 --> 08:47.966
About four months ago.

08:47.991 --> 08:49.487
Got into it for this chick.

08:49.512 --> 08:51.201
She left, but it stayed.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.201
Well, all right.

08:53.226 --> 08:54.802
Did Mom call you and tell you

08:54.827 --> 08:55.968
I need to pick up some documents?

08:55.992 --> 08:57.115
Yeah. Yeah.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.342
Yeah, I keep all that stuff
cataloged in my office.

09:37.053 --> 09:38.820
Dad, what's this?

09:38.822 --> 09:41.092
Was I in Beacon as a kid?

09:43.693 --> 09:45.099
I can't answer that.

09:45.443 --> 09:47.729
What do you mean, you can't answer
it? It's a yes or no question.

09:47.731 --> 09:49.530
That I can't answer.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.090
Your mother made me promise. I'm sorry.

09:52.115 --> 09:54.779
All right. I'll just ask her myself.

09:54.804 --> 09:57.162
No. Put that away.

10:00.729 --> 10:02.529
We're gonna have to
have a family meeting.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.912
Family meeting? We never have those.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.240
What's going on?

10:14.019 --> 10:15.679
Welcome to the Coconut Lounge,

10:15.704 --> 10:18.412
where the drinks are
cold and the jazz is hot.

10:18.862 --> 10:20.628
This next number

10:20.630 --> 10:22.926
is one of our first songs
we ever wrote together.

10:22.951 --> 10:25.865
It's called "Serengeti Rhapsody."

10:26.849 --> 10:29.804
Uno. Dos. Uno. Dos. Tres.

11:07.270 --> 11:08.460
Bless you, bless you.

11:12.692 --> 11:14.231
I-I met someone.

11:15.067 --> 11:18.057
He's, um, from Iceland.
He's really sweet,

11:18.082 --> 11:19.815
and we're taking it slow.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.690
Good for you. Good, good, good.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.198
Sounds like progress.

11:23.223 --> 11:25.354
He's cool. He's, like, um...

11:25.379 --> 11:29.741
he's not really cool,
but I don't really care.

11:29.766 --> 11:33.387
Which... I guess is maturity.

11:34.012 --> 11:35.099
Yes, Nancy.

11:35.124 --> 11:37.138
Do you have something that
you'd like to share with Kelly?

11:37.140 --> 11:38.301
No.

11:39.028 --> 11:41.817
I would like to schedule a
one-on-one appointment with you, Gina.

11:41.842 --> 11:44.012
Just you and me. Alone.

11:45.176 --> 11:46.356
I'm shy.

11:46.381 --> 11:49.606
We don't really do that
here at StarCrossed.

11:50.020 --> 11:51.636
The point of group therapy

11:51.661 --> 11:55.098
is to connect with people
who share a common experience.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.229
You're new.

11:57.254 --> 11:59.093
I made the same mistake.

11:59.095 --> 12:01.082
But you're doing great.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.723
Everybody loves you.

12:02.748 --> 12:05.075
Man, so desperate for love.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.682
You lost me?!

12:06.707 --> 12:07.869
You wandered off.

12:07.871 --> 12:10.229
That's good. Blame
the nine-year-old.

12:10.254 --> 12:12.540
Can you let us explain?
Believe me, we know.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.884
It was not our proudest
parenting moment.

12:14.926 --> 12:17.136
Fine, just tell me what happened.

12:17.161 --> 12:18.606
Okay.

12:19.895 --> 12:22.653
Yes, we went to Beacon.

12:23.723 --> 12:25.815
There was a heat wave that summer.

12:26.137 --> 12:27.630
And we thought we'd go to the lake,

12:27.655 --> 12:29.168
but your father got lost.

12:29.193 --> 12:31.363
We almost hit a deer at one point.

12:31.388 --> 12:32.786
Wait, you almost hit a deer?

12:32.841 --> 12:35.520
So now we're all hungry and lost,

12:35.545 --> 12:38.680
so we go to a grocery
store for some snacks.

12:39.028 --> 12:41.598
Next thing I know, we're
yelling at each other.

12:42.016 --> 12:44.016
I can't even remember what
we were fighting about.

12:44.018 --> 12:46.036
Anything and everything.

12:46.887 --> 12:48.403
We could see that you were upset,

12:48.432 --> 12:49.614
so we got you a grape soda

12:49.639 --> 12:51.597
and we sat you on the horsey ride.

12:51.622 --> 12:54.981
And, after a few minutes, we
looked up, and you were gone.

12:56.706 --> 12:58.270
Ozzie!

12:59.033 --> 13:00.817
We ran ourselves crazy looking for you.

13:00.842 --> 13:03.450
We... we searched all over town.

13:03.475 --> 13:06.171
I've never been more
scared than I was that day.

13:06.173 --> 13:08.692
The worst 48 hours of my life.

13:08.717 --> 13:10.528
We thought we'd lost you for good.

13:10.711 --> 13:13.543
And then, out of nowhere, we got a call.

13:13.568 --> 13:15.958
One of the stock boys
had found you asleep

13:15.983 --> 13:18.784
behind the big bags of dog food.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.918
I blamed him for losing
you. He blamed me.

13:23.318 --> 13:25.856
And the guilt tore us apart.

13:26.434 --> 13:29.028
Soon after that, we got a divorce.

13:29.053 --> 13:30.543
Wow.

13:31.192 --> 13:32.809
We thought you'd be more upset.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.068
You're not mad at us for losing you?

13:35.269 --> 13:37.369
No, I'm-I'm furious at you,

13:37.371 --> 13:40.372
but this explains everything...

13:40.397 --> 13:43.520
all the deja vu that I've
been having in Beacon...

13:43.545 --> 13:47.556
it was just that I was suppressing
the memories of this divorce.

13:47.754 --> 13:51.159
Beacon was the place
where my family fell apart.

13:51.184 --> 13:53.442
That's why Beacon triggered...

13:53.467 --> 13:55.698
all the anxiety and my breakdown.

13:55.723 --> 13:57.598
It wasn't aliens.

13:58.158 --> 13:59.661
Aliens?

14:00.356 --> 14:02.307
Yeah, here's the thing.

14:02.332 --> 14:06.129
I wasn't in Beacon
writing a Civil War novel.

14:06.411 --> 14:10.301
I was in therapy because I thought
I'd been abducted by aliens.

14:14.161 --> 14:16.067
Abducted by aliens?

14:16.194 --> 14:17.229
Therapy?

14:17.254 --> 14:19.151
Good news. I wasn't.

14:19.176 --> 14:21.815
All right? All of the trauma
that I was going through

14:21.840 --> 14:24.136
was just because you all
were horrible parents,

14:24.161 --> 14:26.911
which, no offense,
but this is a relief...

14:26.936 --> 14:28.436
if you see it from my side.

14:28.461 --> 14:30.223
So, like, what, you were seeing,

14:30.248 --> 14:32.249
little green guys or something?

14:32.274 --> 14:34.052
Like, a tall lizard guy,

14:34.077 --> 14:36.466
and then there was, like, a Nordic,

14:36.491 --> 14:38.106
like, white one with long hair.

14:38.131 --> 14:40.231
It's-it's beside the point.

14:40.256 --> 14:43.762
I had my quit my job, and
I was in this support group.

14:43.787 --> 14:46.659
I was living in a shitty motel.

14:46.684 --> 14:50.237
I had a piece of metal
taken out of my head,

14:50.262 --> 14:53.348
which I need to talk to you
guys about that at some point...

14:53.373 --> 14:55.934
but I had really spiraled.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.293
Ozzie, why didn't you tell us?

14:58.345 --> 15:01.039
You kept a secret from me for 30 years.

15:01.064 --> 15:03.200
I kept one for two months.

15:03.225 --> 15:08.903
So I think... it's a little
kettle-calling-the-pot-kettle.

15:09.168 --> 15:13.129
So, Nancy, last time, you
mentioned you lost a friend.

15:13.343 --> 15:14.997
I believe his name was Kirk.

15:15.022 --> 15:16.872
Kurt, actually.

15:16.897 --> 15:18.731
Y-yeah, is he your boyfriend?

15:18.756 --> 15:21.256
'Cause you never actually mentioned...

15:21.281 --> 15:22.778
He was my co-worker.

15:22.803 --> 15:24.731
But you were close.

15:25.189 --> 15:27.161
Yes, we were very close.

15:27.497 --> 15:29.922
Did you feel that you and Kurt...

15:30.051 --> 15:32.692
were more than just coworkers?

15:32.930 --> 15:35.122
Yes, I suppose we were.

15:35.577 --> 15:37.497
- We had a...
- Special bond.

15:37.522 --> 15:39.088
Did you love Kurt?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.817
Is she taunting me?

15:42.934 --> 15:44.090
Does she want to luxuriate

15:44.115 --> 15:46.426
in the details of the
murder she committed?

15:47.377 --> 15:49.144
I won't give her the pleasure.

15:50.356 --> 15:52.340
I came here to join
this group for support.

15:52.365 --> 15:55.450
I did not come here to be
interrogated in a barn by some quack.

15:55.475 --> 15:58.543
No! Nancy! Use that!

15:58.568 --> 16:01.278
Your anger is good! Own it! Own it!

16:01.303 --> 16:03.069
Or take it out on me if you need to.

16:03.094 --> 16:04.598
I know what this is.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.988
She's super jealous.

16:07.272 --> 16:09.216
She thinks you're in love with me.

16:10.176 --> 16:11.933
Why would she think that?

16:13.043 --> 16:14.286
I don't know.

16:14.311 --> 16:15.669
Well, um...

16:15.694 --> 16:18.138
I know we're a bunch of old guys
up there, and we're a little rusty.

16:18.162 --> 16:19.739
You have a number-one fan here.

16:19.764 --> 16:21.129
- Okay. Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.207
I had no idea there
was this side to you.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.145
It's something that doesn't come
up in my day job, right? So...

16:26.170 --> 16:28.237
- No, I had fun.
- Well, thank you.

16:28.262 --> 16:29.929
Okay, um, well, it is
getting late tonight.

16:29.953 --> 16:30.966
I should probably head back.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.793
Yes, and I... you know,
they're loading up,

16:32.818 --> 16:34.747
so I just need to help
the fellows load up.

16:34.772 --> 16:36.772
- Yeah. Sure.
- So... see you around.

16:36.812 --> 16:38.817
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay.

16:38.842 --> 16:40.091
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.060
- Take it easy.
- You too.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.294
Good night.

16:54.657 --> 16:55.675
Bye.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.208
Keyboards.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.021
Ozzie?

17:04.047 --> 17:06.481
I thought maybe you'd like to see this.

17:07.453 --> 17:08.909
What's this?

17:09.877 --> 17:12.604
I couldn't stop thinking
about that day in Beacon,

17:12.628 --> 17:15.663
and when you mentioned
the alien therapy thing,

17:16.042 --> 17:17.987
I remembered you started drawing these

17:18.012 --> 17:19.444
right after you got lost.

17:19.762 --> 17:21.595
I drew this?

17:21.619 --> 17:23.553
And about 500 others.

17:23.906 --> 17:26.441
There's another shoe
box full in the bedroom.

17:26.909 --> 17:30.542
You called it "Snake
Man and Little Guy."

17:31.620 --> 17:33.548
And you didn't think this was weird?

17:33.550 --> 17:35.612
It creeped me out at the time.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.433
I wanted to take you to therapy,

17:37.465 --> 17:39.620
but your father said it was...

17:39.816 --> 17:41.940
quote, "white people shit."

17:41.965 --> 17:43.792
I still think it is.

17:44.018 --> 17:45.417
No offense.

17:45.451 --> 17:47.448
We just felt you needed to see these...

17:47.473 --> 17:48.839
after what you told us.

17:48.919 --> 17:50.659
I appreciate that.

17:52.628 --> 17:56.276
I thought I had an answer,
and now I have more questions.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.636
You know, Nancy
seemed pretty shaken up.

18:00.661 --> 18:02.794
I'm gonna go check on her.

18:03.035 --> 18:04.979
Sorry, Gina. I just...

18:05.760 --> 18:10.917
Okay, um, maybe that's
a good stopping place.

18:11.518 --> 18:13.347
Ennis, can we use the barn next week?

18:13.372 --> 18:16.964
No. The barn's booked for a wedding.

18:17.027 --> 18:19.292
Yeah, can I say something?

18:19.764 --> 18:21.362
We should take a break.

18:21.732 --> 18:23.065
What do you mean?

18:25.293 --> 18:26.589
I mean...

18:27.442 --> 18:29.738
- what is that?
- Calista, shut up.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.115
Look around.

18:31.296 --> 18:33.044
You know, we're half gone.

18:33.315 --> 18:35.073
We're in a barn.

18:35.224 --> 18:37.690
Seems like we're just forcing it.

18:37.715 --> 18:40.089
It doesn't really feel
like group anymore. Doesn't.

18:40.114 --> 18:42.262
And I know what groups feel
like. I'm in a lot of groups.

18:42.286 --> 18:44.628
I'm in... I'm in,
the Knitting Circle,

18:44.653 --> 18:47.347
and then Let's Take a Hike With Seniors

18:47.372 --> 18:49.362
and Death Talk Cafe...

18:49.393 --> 18:51.784
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay, cool.

18:51.809 --> 18:53.823
Okay, cool. Great.

18:54.363 --> 18:57.064
So, our next meeting is TBD.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.523
Or how about not at all? How about that?

19:01.547 --> 19:03.217
- No. No, that's extreme.
- No, no.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.672
Is it? Is that extreme, Margaret?

19:05.697 --> 19:08.965
Well, how's... how's
this for extreme, okay?

19:09.155 --> 19:12.231
Holding this entire group...

19:12.256 --> 19:16.374
on my shoulders for
all of this time, okay?

19:16.399 --> 19:18.749
Holding... trying to
find places to meet...

19:18.774 --> 19:20.483
and trying to help people...

19:20.508 --> 19:23.428
and giving and giving and giving...

19:23.453 --> 19:25.701
and giving and giving
and giving and giving...

19:25.726 --> 19:29.030
until there is nothing
left of the giving tree!

19:29.055 --> 19:30.389
Do you know what happens then?

19:30.414 --> 19:31.459
It dies!

19:31.484 --> 19:35.954
And everybody sits around
on the stump of the tree!

19:36.580 --> 19:38.965
Good! Why don't you just
have your meetings...

19:41.049 --> 19:43.170
You know what? Maybe I need a break.

19:43.195 --> 19:44.874
Aah, it!

19:44.899 --> 19:47.029
It's TBD!

20:19.708 --> 20:21.608
- Shh.
- What?

20:21.633 --> 20:23.336
You're gonna wake up Ozzie.

20:23.361 --> 20:26.019
This just gets weirder and weirder.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.772
- Empathize...
- With this.
