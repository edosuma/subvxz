three idealistic
young CIA officers

00:23.424 --> 00:24.992

stop the spread of Communism,

25:16.015 --> 25:18.250
In Laos?
Oh, around 15 years.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.587
I haven't been back to France
for a long time.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.890
When you first came here,
what was it like?

25:23.923 --> 25:25.592
It was just open.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.159
You know, it was
beginning of 2000.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.661
What do you mean by "just open"?

25:28.695 --> 25:30.730
Before, it was very difficult
to travel, you know.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.265
If you have a permit
to travel in Luang Prabang,

25:33.299 --> 25:35.334
you can only visit
Luang Prabang.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.836
If you want to go
another province,

25:36.869 --> 25:39.238
you need to have
a special permit to change.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.273
And I had a friend,
and my friend say,

25:41.307 --> 25:42.775
"No, let's go to Laos.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.277
"It's more protected,
more natural,

25:45.311 --> 25:46.579
more authentic."

25:46.613 --> 25:48.280
I said, "Okay.
Why not?"

25:48.314 --> 25:50.282
The first time I arrived
in Luang Prabang,

25:50.316 --> 25:52.451
I was feeling like Indiana Jones

25:52.484 --> 25:55.421
discovering a beautiful city.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.523
And the point is,
I fell in love,

25:57.556 --> 25:59.091
and I couldn't go back.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.030
What's your typical day here?

26:04.063 --> 26:07.099
Like, if you're not working,
on a good day, you know.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.368
On a good day, you have a party.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.870
You have a party.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.438
Beerlao, friends,
that's what for.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.641
Again, there is
nothing special to do.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.976
It's just the way of life.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.378
♪

26:19.411 --> 26:21.948
- Look.
- Yeah, training.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.284
♪

26:25.317 --> 26:27.586
So how has it changed
over the years?

26:27.620 --> 26:30.923
I mean, you go to Saigon
or Hanoi...

26:30.957 --> 26:32.659
Money, money, money coming in.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.227
Foreign ownership of everything.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.763
Is... that's not happening here?

26:36.796 --> 26:40.266
Yes, I can see there is
the next generation now.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.501
Now when you go to the markets
and you say,

26:42.534 --> 26:44.170
"Where is it from?"
they say,

26:44.203 --> 26:46.939
"Thailand, Vietnam, China."

26:46.973 --> 26:49.676
And to find local foods
is difficult.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.679
But if you talk to old people,
they will say, "Boh penh nyang."

26:52.712 --> 26:54.747
"We are like the bamboo.
We are not trees.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.117
"So when there is too much wind,
we bend, and we get up,

26:58.150 --> 27:00.787
and boh penh nyang."

27:00.820 --> 27:04.156
I was a monk for a little bit
more than one month.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.625
In fact, I "signed"
for three weeks.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.861
After three weeks, I wanted
to stay a little bit.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.698
They push a lot
the way to not suffer,

27:11.731 --> 27:16.602
to learn how to disconnect
the important things in life.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.470
That's why the people,
they drink a lot.

27:18.504 --> 27:20.940
They like to enjoy, to share.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.675
If you don't share,
you are poor.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.978
The more you give,
the more you are rich.

27:26.012 --> 27:28.981
You have money a lot.
You lose your money tomorrow.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.382
Some people would be upset.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.051
And you go up and going down.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.853
It's never a good feeling.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.454
Boh penh nyang.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.156
I just say look at the river.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.459
It's go up. It's go down.
But always in the same way.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.294
And at the end is the end.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.496
Boh penh nyang.

♪

29:09.681 --> 29:11.283
Let us assume the best

of the intelligence officers
who served here,

29:14.086 --> 29:17.223
of the pilots and bombardiers
who ran missions over Laos...

29:26.165 --> 29:28.234
Yes, banana and lemongrass.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.736
That still leaves us
with the unarguable fact

29:30.769 --> 29:32.571
that generations later,

29:32.604 --> 29:36.843
UXOs, or unexploded ordnances,
remain a huge problem.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.744
What's here?
Cluster bomb, mostly?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.779
Or bombies?
Yes, yes.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.596
Organizations like UXO Lao

29:57.629 --> 29:59.798
are tasked
with cleaning up the mess.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.767
You go with a metal detector,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.602
dig them out by hand,
no machines,

30:03.635 --> 30:05.437
detonate them.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.139
The technology we use nowadays

30:07.173 --> 30:09.008
is the same as 20 years ago.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.409
Right.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.172
Wow.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.943
That's a big bang.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.413
Yeah.

30:47.446 --> 30:51.417
Laos is the mostly heavily
bombed country per capita

30:51.450 --> 30:53.085
in the history of the world.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.486
Yeah.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.755
80 million is the number
of cluster bombs

30:56.788 --> 30:58.324
that did not detonate.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.893
Since the war in Vietnam ended

31:00.927 --> 31:03.329
and we left our Secret War here
behind,

31:03.362 --> 31:05.664
20,000 people, many of whom

31:05.697 --> 31:07.699
were not even alive
during the conflicts,

31:07.733 --> 31:10.069
have been killed or maimed.

who are blown up, who are they?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.673
Mostly farmers?

a little bit changed

31:17.743 --> 31:20.346
to the children right now,

31:20.379 --> 31:23.349
because the children,
is look like tennis ball,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.517
is good for playing,

31:25.551 --> 31:27.954
for the children to pick up
as a toy.

31:35.661 --> 31:39.631
So far, only half
of 1% of the country

31:39.665 --> 31:41.367

31:41.400 --> 31:43.635
80 million cluster bombs
are still left in the country.

Right.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.941
20 years, what we did
is 1.4 million.

31:48.975 --> 31:51.610

- 20 years.

In a Communist, one-party state

it can be dangerous

talk about this or not,

36:32.558 --> 36:34.226
whether it's
a comfortable subject or not.
