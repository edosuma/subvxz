File A56-7W.

01:02.685 --> 01:04.379
(narrator)
Subject.: Airwolf. Top secret.

01:04.453 --> 01:06.011
A Mach 1-plus
attack helicopter

01:06.088 --> 01:08.352
with the most advanced
weapons arsenal in the air.

01:08.424 --> 01:10.255
Sought by governments
friendly and foreign,

01:10.326 --> 01:12.385
Airwolf is hidden somewhere
in the western wilderness

01:12.461 --> 01:14.053
by its test pilot,
Stringfellow Hawke

01:14.129 --> 01:15.756
to be returned to
the U.S. government

01:15.831 --> 01:17.298
only if his brother,
Saint John,

01:17.366 --> 01:18.731
an MIA in Vietnam,
can be found.

01:18.801 --> 01:20.860
The deputy director
of the intelligence agency

01:20.936 --> 01:22.233
that developed Airwolf

01:22.304 --> 01:23.999
is Michael
Coldsmith-Briggs III,

01:24.073 --> 01:25.301
code name Archangel.

01:25.374 --> 01:27.808
Believed to covertly provide
classified information

01:27.876 --> 01:29.969
and support to Hawke
in exchange for
flying the chopper

01:30.045 --> 01:31.706
on missions of
national interest.

01:31.780 --> 01:33.441
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,

01:33.515 --> 01:34.914
reclusive, sensitive,
and a loner.

01:34.984 --> 01:36.144
Known to associate with

01:36.218 --> 01:38.118
his only friend and mentor,
Dominic Santini.

01:38.187 --> 01:40.587
Together, Santini
and Hawke fly Airwolf.

01:40.656 --> 01:42.920
Capable of speeds
rivaling the fastest jets

01:42.992 --> 01:44.550
and backed by
unmatched firepower,

01:44.627 --> 01:46.185
Airwolf is
a weapon too dangerous

01:46.262 --> 01:47.786
to be left in
unenlightened hands.

01:47.863 --> 01:49.831
Finding Airwolf is
your first priority.

01:49.898 --> 01:51.160

(Moore)
What's here is a gift.
Talk costs money.

03:28.197 --> 03:30.688
I'll be at the closed-down
airstrip over in Crofton
in an hour.

03:30.766 --> 03:32.290
Come if you're interested.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.000
(Hawke)
Saint John.

04:28.424 --> 04:30.654
Hello, old stick.
Remember me?

04:32.928 --> 04:34.725
Peter MacGregor Moore.

04:35.230 --> 04:36.822
How could l
ever forget?

04:36.899 --> 04:38.867
Short notice, but l
thought you'd make it.

04:39.601 --> 04:41.000
ls my brother alive?

04:41.069 --> 04:43.697
Ah! l said that
talk costs money.

04:44.606 --> 04:46.471
How much money?

04:47.709 --> 04:50.405
l'd take a trade.
Say, that chopper over there.

04:50.479 --> 04:52.174
lt's not mine.

04:52.247 --> 04:54.477
Too bad.
What about your cabin?

04:54.917 --> 04:56.851
Or maybe this
wonderful art collection

04:56.919 --> 04:58.443
l've heard so much about.

05:01.089 --> 05:03.148
The years haven't improved
your sense of humor,

05:03.225 --> 05:04.283
have they?

05:04.359 --> 05:05.826
Don't you play
with me, Moore.

05:06.328 --> 05:07.852
Not about this.

05:08.497 --> 05:11.694
l'll take $1,000
to cover my expenses.

05:12.334 --> 05:13.528
Agreed.

05:16.572 --> 05:18.733
Your brother's being
held in this compound.

05:19.908 --> 05:21.170
Weighs about
100 pounds,

05:21.243 --> 05:22.904
but he's
basically healthy.

05:23.045 --> 05:24.740
His mind is
still in good nick.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.269
Where?

05:26.515 --> 05:28.745
Quon Ling province,
North Vietnam.

05:29.017 --> 05:30.848
Off-course weather satellite
picked him up

05:30.919 --> 05:32.147
purely by chance.

05:32.588 --> 05:35.056
Saint John is being held
with 1 1 other Caucasians

05:35.123 --> 05:38.456
by an ex-NVA colonel
named Nuyen Min Giap.

05:39.161 --> 05:41.288
Apparently, a man
who holds a grudge.

05:41.363 --> 05:43.729
Two of his prisoners
are ex-Frog Legionnaires

05:43.866 --> 05:47.302
dating all the way
back to Dien Bien Phu in '54.

05:47.569 --> 05:49.264
Poor sods
are in their 60s.

05:49.404 --> 05:51.133
How'd you find
out about this?

05:51.240 --> 05:52.468
Another mercenary.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.668
He occasionally
freelances for the Firm.

05:55.277 --> 05:56.539
After we picked up the shot,

05:56.612 --> 05:58.603
we sent him in
to take a closer look.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.511
So, the Firm
knows all about this?

06:01.483 --> 06:03.451
Wondering why
your friend Archangel

06:03.519 --> 06:04.713
didn't tell you?

06:07.389 --> 06:09.186
Don't be too hard
on old Michael.

06:09.858 --> 06:11.553
He's got a task
force together,

06:11.627 --> 06:12.787
ready for a rescue mission.

06:12.861 --> 06:14.453
Trained them
personally at Langley

06:14.530 --> 06:16.930
so they wouldn't screw up,
like they did in lran.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.864
At the last minute,
the State Department

06:18.934 --> 06:20.367
pulled the rug
from under him.

06:20.435 --> 06:21.697
Last l heard,

06:21.770 --> 06:23.601
they were negotiating
for a release.

06:24.806 --> 06:26.535
Now you know
as much as l know.

06:26.608 --> 06:28.007
l suggest you
don't tip your hand

06:28.076 --> 06:29.304
to dear Michael.

06:31.647 --> 06:33.046
Don't you want
your money?

06:34.349 --> 06:36.146
l had a brother once.

06:36.218 --> 06:38.379
l lost him in Rhodesia
a couple of years ago.

06:38.654 --> 06:39.985
lt's on the house.

06:40.055 --> 06:43.115
Even an old whore like me
has a heart buried somewhere.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.667
[people chattering]

08:44.446 --> 08:45.936
Over here, come on.

08:46.948 --> 08:48.347

09:05.901 --> 09:06.890
[siren wailing]

09:07.969 --> 09:09.960
lt's an artery.
lt won't stop.

09:10.472 --> 09:12.565
10cc's epinephrine, fast.

09:13.008 --> 09:15.909
Piggy-back lV.

09:16.011 --> 09:17.535
[machine beating]

09:19.114 --> 09:20.513
He's fibrillating!

09:21.116 --> 09:24.085
Heart paddles.
Heart paddles.

09:28.023 --> 09:29.320
Stay back.

11:45.327 --> 11:46.589
[alarm ringing]

12:04.813 --> 12:06.041
Get him back.

12:07.515 --> 12:08.504
You shouldn't be here.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.414
This floor is private.
Get lost.

12:11.286 --> 12:12.480
Now!

12:13.488 --> 12:14.580
Sorry.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.951
l thought you said
that elevator was fixed.

12:21.029 --> 12:23.293
lt just came up here
with someone from downstairs.

12:23.365 --> 12:26.232
Make sure
it doesn't happen again.

12:32.073 --> 12:33.233
Where am l?

12:33.775 --> 12:35.709
You're in a hospital.

12:35.844 --> 12:37.778
You were in
a helicopter crash.

12:40.282 --> 12:42.409
Wait. How long
have l been here?

12:42.550 --> 12:43.517
[panting]

12:43.585 --> 12:44.517
Shh.

12:44.586 --> 12:45.848
Rest now.

12:46.988 --> 12:48.956
Doctor Rothchild
has been called for.

12:49.758 --> 12:52.192
And he'll answer
all your questions
when he gets here.

12:52.260 --> 12:53.420
What day is this?

12:54.396 --> 12:55.658
lt's Wednesday.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.391
l have to make
a phone call.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.157
l have to call Dom.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.565
(Simmons)
You will have to wait.

13:00.635 --> 13:01.624
lt can't wait.

13:01.703 --> 13:03.295
(Rothchild)
lt already has, Mr. Hawke.

13:03.371 --> 13:05.931
You've been comatose
for the better
part of a year.

13:09.477 --> 13:10.944
My name is Dr. Rothchild.

13:11.746 --> 13:12.678
l've been your physician

13:12.714 --> 13:14.773
for the past
eight-and-a-half months.

13:27.095 --> 13:27.857
Your pupils are working like

13:27.896 --> 13:30.126
the aperture of
an expensive camera.

13:31.032 --> 13:32.090
lt's a good sign.

13:33.168 --> 13:34.863
What is that thing?

13:35.003 --> 13:36.732
This is
an EEG machine.

13:37.605 --> 13:39.766
Records the electrical
impulses in the brain.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.570
lt tells us if there's
been any damage done.

13:46.047 --> 13:47.344
There's no chance of...

13:47.415 --> 13:48.382
(Rothchild)
There's always a chance

13:48.416 --> 13:50.884
when someone's been
comatose for a long time.

13:53.021 --> 13:54.921
Do you remember
anything of the crash?

13:56.391 --> 13:57.756
Bits and pieces.
l...

13:57.826 --> 13:59.555
We think that you
had a heart seizure

13:59.627 --> 14:01.322
at the controls
of your helicopter.

14:01.429 --> 14:02.987
Shortly after
you arrived here,

14:03.064 --> 14:04.895
you went into
complete cardiac arrest.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.233
So, clinically, you were
gone for several minutes.

14:10.839 --> 14:14.002
Did a man named, uh,
Dominic Santini

14:14.075 --> 14:15.406
come to see me?

14:17.746 --> 14:18.940
There's lots of news

14:19.014 --> 14:20.845
that you have to
catch up on, Mr. Hawke.

14:21.216 --> 14:22.581
lt's best that
we move slowly.

14:22.650 --> 14:23.674
Doctor,

14:24.552 --> 14:26.349
that's a pretty
simple question.

14:26.488 --> 14:28.285
Did Dominic come to see me?

14:32.093 --> 14:33.185
Sat in that chair

14:33.261 --> 14:34.956
and he talked to you
for hours on end.

14:35.030 --> 14:36.554
He was convinced
you could hear him,

14:36.631 --> 14:38.155
even though
you didn't answer.

14:39.667 --> 14:40.929
He was a good friend.

14:43.171 --> 14:44.502
What do you mean ''was''?

14:45.673 --> 14:47.265
Mr. Santini is dead.

14:54.282 --> 14:55.442
How?

14:56.918 --> 14:58.442
He and several
other men raided

14:58.520 --> 14:59.782
a prison camp
in North Vietnam

14:59.854 --> 15:02.652
that was still
holding Americans prisoner.

15:02.991 --> 15:05.357
Your brother, Saint John,
was among them.

15:05.427 --> 15:06.451
He was rescued,

15:06.494 --> 15:10.260
but Mr. Santini and
another man were killed
in the process.

15:10.331 --> 15:11.355
Saint John's here?

15:11.433 --> 15:12.491
Yes.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.035
He is on his way back
from Alexandria, Virginia.

15:15.136 --> 15:17.297
We called him last night
when you came to.

15:18.039 --> 15:19.404
When was this raid?

15:21.076 --> 15:22.668
Who's the other man?

15:22.744 --> 15:26.145
The raid was-- was
way back in July.

15:26.448 --> 15:30.942
The other man was
a man named Coldsmith-Briggs.

15:33.388 --> 15:34.582
[sighs]

15:34.656 --> 15:35.850
Archangel.

15:38.093 --> 15:39.287
(Rothchild)
He's been told.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.725
What do you mean?

15:40.962 --> 15:42.691
You told him?
Just point-blank?

15:42.764 --> 15:43.924
What else could l do?

15:43.998 --> 15:45.090
He asked me
straight out.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.697
You were wrong to
overload him so quickly.

15:48.169 --> 15:50.694
We're dealing with a year
of his life that's gone.

15:51.172 --> 15:53.402
lt's extremely difficult
to assimilate.

15:53.541 --> 15:55.805
l wish you'd called me first.

15:56.144 --> 15:57.668
lf you're
so concerned, Doctor,

15:57.745 --> 15:58.939
l suggest you get over there

15:59.013 --> 16:00.810
and begin
the therapeutic process.

16:01.316 --> 16:02.783
Do you agree?

16:07.222 --> 16:08.211
[dialing]

16:16.498 --> 16:17.556
He's been told.

16:18.766 --> 16:21.701
No. He actually took it
quite well, considering.

16:23.271 --> 16:24.397
He's very strong.

16:24.639 --> 16:26.834
[chattering on TV]

16:27.275 --> 16:28.537
[male TV anchor]
From Great Britain

16:28.610 --> 16:30.077
the news of Lady Di's

16:30.145 --> 16:31.874
filing for divorce
from Prince Charles

16:31.946 --> 16:34.506
has come as quite
a shock to both families,

16:34.582 --> 16:37.142
as well as society columnists
all over the world.

16:37.418 --> 16:38.976
Margo,
what do you think about that?

16:39.053 --> 16:41.749
(Margo)
Well, who could have
predicted it a few months ago?

16:41.823 --> 16:44.018
(male anchor)
It seems to me,
I recall seeing a tabloid

16:44.092 --> 16:45.992
on my market checkout counter

16:46.060 --> 16:47.891
that spoke of it
being a possibility.

16:48.463 --> 16:50.590
I wonder what her
settlement will be?

16:51.466 --> 16:53.991
Probably, they will
split the crown jewels.

17:00.842 --> 17:03.436
(woman on PA system)
Doctor Barr, 377.

17:04.045 --> 17:06.605
Doctor Barr, call 377.

17:46.287 --> 17:47.447
[knocking on door]

17:49.557 --> 17:50.546
l'm Dr. Holgate.

17:50.592 --> 17:52.492
May l talk with
you for a moment?

17:54.696 --> 17:55.685
Yeah.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.189
Oh.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.267
[sighs]

18:03.338 --> 18:05.465
l see they've--they've
given you the articles

18:05.540 --> 18:07.235
that they were
saving for you.

18:07.842 --> 18:09.503
Your emotions must
be going

18:09.577 --> 18:11.670
in a lot of different
directions at the moment.

18:11.746 --> 18:12.906
A good friend dead,

18:12.981 --> 18:15.176
a brother coming back
as if from the dead.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.741
A year gone by
without being accounted for.

18:18.319 --> 18:19.616
You're a shrink.

18:19.687 --> 18:20.676
[chuckles]

18:20.755 --> 18:22.382
l wondered when
they'd send you in.

18:22.890 --> 18:25.051
You think l'm
standard operating procedure,

18:25.126 --> 18:26.115
do you?

18:26.928 --> 18:28.190
For the Firm you are.

18:28.263 --> 18:29.287
Huh-huh.

18:29.364 --> 18:31.059
That is who's paying
for this, isn't it?

18:31.132 --> 18:32.121
Huh-huh.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.224
[sighs]

18:33.301 --> 18:35.496
What the hell is that
stuff they're giving me?

18:36.471 --> 18:38.735
Just a five-percent-glucose
solution.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.564
They'll disconnect it

18:40.642 --> 18:42.439
when you start eating
solid foods again.

18:44.078 --> 18:46.342
And what's
making me so groggy?

18:46.481 --> 18:48.745
Well, you've been
hibernating almost a year.

18:49.651 --> 18:51.380
Your metabolism
has slowed down

18:51.452 --> 18:54.250
to a crawl.
Your muscles have atrophied.

18:55.657 --> 18:58.125
lt's the same thing
up there.

18:58.793 --> 19:01.193
Your synapses slow
down from lack of use.

19:01.963 --> 19:04.864
You feel groggy,
logy, punchy.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.534
You'll feel better
in time.

19:09.837 --> 19:11.236
l'll come back tomorrow.

19:14.409 --> 19:16.104
(woman on PA system)
Attention please.:

19:16.177 --> 19:16.836
There is a blue
Chevrolet

19:16.878 --> 19:19.176
blocking the emergency
ambulance entrance.

19:19.580 --> 19:20.911
There is a blue
Chevrolet

19:21.015 --> 19:22.846
blocking the emergency
ambulance entrance.

19:28.990 --> 19:29.513
[beeping]

19:40.401 --> 19:42.232
l didn't know they
were getting divorced.

19:42.303 --> 19:44.168
Yeah, life is unpredictable,
isn't it?

19:45.006 --> 19:45.995
Yeah.

19:48.576 --> 19:49.736
This must be
your floor.

19:49.811 --> 19:52.041
Oh, yeah. Yours, too.
Doesn't go any further.

19:52.714 --> 19:54.238
Does if
you have a key.

19:54.315 --> 19:56.306
(woman on PA system)
Dr. Stevens, Pediatrics.

19:56.984 --> 19:57.951
Bye.

19:58.019 --> 19:59.077
Bye. Have a nice day.

20:05.927 --> 20:07.224
(Lisa)
Stringfellow,

20:08.563 --> 20:10.121
you have a visitor.

20:28.616 --> 20:29.605
Well?

20:35.990 --> 20:37.184
Saint John?

20:38.659 --> 20:39.648
Yeah.

20:51.839 --> 20:52.965
You look great.

20:53.741 --> 20:55.038
So do you,

20:55.676 --> 20:59.203
considering what l saw here
three months ago.

21:03.484 --> 21:05.611
(TV announcer)
Press representatives
were called

21:05.686 --> 21:07.483
to Buckingham Palace
yesterday afternoon

21:07.555 --> 21:09.648
to hear Her Majesty's
press secretary

21:09.724 --> 21:11.316
read a short
statement describing

21:11.392 --> 21:12.518
what many suspected

21:12.593 --> 21:15.027
and what now
has been confirmed.:

21:15.229 --> 21:17.094
that Prince Charles
and Lady Di

21:17.165 --> 21:18.564
have called it a day.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.191
Parliament has
issued a blackout...

21:20.268 --> 21:23.101
Prince Charles
and Lady Diana. Sick.

21:23.204 --> 21:25.331
What's the world coming to?

21:26.908 --> 21:28.899
The brothers are
getting along famously.

21:29.177 --> 21:30.872
(Rothchild)
l commend you, Dr. Holgate.

21:32.447 --> 21:33.846
l could talk to him tonight.

21:34.449 --> 21:35.575
Too soon.

21:35.783 --> 21:36.943
(Abrams)
Why?

21:37.652 --> 21:39.847
For one thing,
he's still terribly groggy.

21:40.588 --> 21:42.180
He won't be able to help you.

21:42.723 --> 21:44.554
Reduce his medication
a little bit.

21:44.725 --> 21:46.022
lf l did that,

21:46.194 --> 21:49.425
the whole house of cards
would come tumbling down.

21:49.497 --> 21:52.489
(Lisa)
The methods we're employing
are simply not foolproof.

21:53.668 --> 21:55.329
You both seem to forget that.

21:56.704 --> 21:58.069
Reduce his medication.

21:59.073 --> 22:02.338
(Abrams)
The longer the delay,
the greater the external risk.

22:02.410 --> 22:04.105
Now, l want us all
on that plane

22:04.212 --> 22:05.679
this time tomorrow.

22:06.314 --> 22:07.303
[horn honks]

22:10.051 --> 22:13.214
You know, it's funny,
but l was confined to a cell

22:13.254 --> 22:16.280
maybe a third
the size of this room.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.255
But l learned to
have total freedom

22:19.460 --> 22:20.791
in my mind here.

22:21.696 --> 22:22.754
l used think through

22:22.797 --> 22:25.789
some of the most
incredibly detailed projects.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.767
l built a house once.
lt was, uh...

22:27.902 --> 22:29.802
l cut every
two-by-four in my mind,

22:29.937 --> 22:31.302
hammered in every nail.

22:31.973 --> 22:33.065
lt was my dream house.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.108
lt took me about
six months to do that one.

22:36.143 --> 22:37.303
A bloody horror.

22:39.247 --> 22:42.478
Yeah, but it's all over now,
thanks to your friends.

22:45.286 --> 22:46.947
How did Dominic die?

22:48.456 --> 22:49.684
lt was quick.

22:50.525 --> 22:52.322
The unit had three choppers,

22:52.493 --> 22:55.189
two Chinooks and
a Cobra for air support.

22:56.564 --> 22:59.089
Dom and Archangel
were in the Cobra.

22:59.734 --> 23:02.100
They took some small-arms
fire on the way out,

23:02.904 --> 23:05.168
flew about
five or six more miles,

23:05.907 --> 23:07.238
then went in.

23:09.210 --> 23:10.700
No chance they survived?

23:10.778 --> 23:11.767
No.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.246
lt looked like napalm
when they hit the ground.

23:18.753 --> 23:19.777
Tired?

23:21.689 --> 23:24.556
Yeah,
it's too good a day.

23:25.359 --> 23:27.384
l don't want it to end.

23:27.461 --> 23:31.158
(woman on PA system)
Doctors Levine and Patterson,
please pick up your messages.

23:32.833 --> 23:33.857
[knocking]

23:33.935 --> 23:35.027
Sorry to interrupt.

23:35.102 --> 23:37.195
No, you're not interrupting.
l'm just leaving.

23:37.572 --> 23:39.335
String would like to know
when l can, uh,

23:39.407 --> 23:40.704
l can take him home.

23:41.108 --> 23:42.803
l think in
about a week or so.

23:44.946 --> 23:46.914
This is Morton Abrams,
Mr. Hawke.

23:47.214 --> 23:48.408
Do you have
the energy to talk

23:48.482 --> 23:49.847
to him for
a couple of minutes?

23:54.255 --> 23:55.222
l'll see you
tomorrow.

23:55.289 --> 23:56.313
l'll walk with you.

23:58.526 --> 23:59.686
Do you mind?

24:00.061 --> 24:01.050
No.

24:01.395 --> 24:02.953
l assume you have
a pretty good idea

24:03.030 --> 24:04.258
where l'm from.

24:05.166 --> 24:06.428
The Firm.

24:11.639 --> 24:13.106
Archangel's
replacement.

24:13.541 --> 24:15.736
Hmm, not really,
just the man who got his job.

24:15.810 --> 24:17.937
He was, uh,
rather unique.

24:18.245 --> 24:20.543
(woman on PA system)
Doctor Levy to admitting.

24:21.716 --> 24:24.116
l, uh, have to clear up
a few details, such as

24:24.185 --> 24:26.517
a piece of
U.S. Government hardware.

24:27.922 --> 24:29.048
Airwolf.

24:30.524 --> 24:33.186
Since you don't seem to have
any further use for it...

24:36.397 --> 24:37.694
Now, if we could clear up

24:37.765 --> 24:39.596
this little piece of
business now,

24:40.101 --> 24:42.262
l could return to
Virginia tonight.

24:49.143 --> 24:52.078
Do you have a Las Vegas
area sectional map?

24:53.280 --> 24:54.770
l can have
one in a minute.

25:11.132 --> 25:12.121
lt's in the desert,

25:12.199 --> 25:13.723
a place called
Valley of the Gods.

25:14.468 --> 25:16.197
Excellent.
That's excellent.

25:16.771 --> 25:18.739
(woman on PA system)
Oncology 629.

25:18.806 --> 25:20.433
Oncology.

25:31.485 --> 25:33.919
Stage One is now complete,
ladies and gentlemen.

25:33.988 --> 25:35.285
l commend you all.

25:35.356 --> 25:37.517
Your commendation
will be better appreciated

25:37.591 --> 25:39.388
in the form
of a nice fat check.

25:39.994 --> 25:42.428
l'm sure you'll be quite
well-compensated, Peter.

25:42.496 --> 25:45.226
Should l prepare
Mr. Hawke for traveling?

25:45.399 --> 25:48.698
Yes, our Libyan friends
are dying to meet him again.

25:50.271 --> 25:51.898
Shall we begin
Stage Two?

25:56.911 --> 26:00.369
(woman on PA system)
Dr. Barr, call 377. Dr. Barr.

26:31.812 --> 26:34.406
Doctor Huggins,
please call 617.

26:35.182 --> 26:38.310
Doctor Huggins,
please call 617.

27:16.190 --> 27:18.522
Doctor Higgins,
please call 617.

27:18.759 --> 27:21.728
Doctor Higgins,
please call 617.

27:41.749 --> 27:42.909
Hold still.

27:42.983 --> 27:44.075
[choking]

27:44.151 --> 27:46.142
Hold still.
All l want from you
is today's date.

27:50.157 --> 27:51.385
Saturday,
March 3.

27:51.458 --> 27:52.755
What year?

27:52.893 --> 27:54.190
1984.

27:58.432 --> 27:59.694
Calluses.

28:01.035 --> 28:02.332
Sure are.

28:02.403 --> 28:04.564
l wouldn't have calluses

28:04.638 --> 28:07.106
if l'd been in a coma
for a year, would l?

28:11.478 --> 28:15.380
(woman on PA system)
Control to all units,
advise that a 407 occurred...

28:23.824 --> 28:24.813
[brakes screeching]

28:27.228 --> 28:30.129
Looks like the vehicle had
dual rear wheels.

28:30.197 --> 28:31.255
A truck, maybe.

28:31.332 --> 28:32.663
Are there any
fingerprints

28:32.733 --> 28:34.223
other than
Hawke's in the cockpit?

28:34.301 --> 28:36.599
(Charlene)
They're trying to
lift some right now.

28:37.938 --> 28:38.996
Dom.

28:46.747 --> 28:48.146
ls that the ship
he borrowed?

28:48.215 --> 28:49.375
Yeah.

28:49.650 --> 28:51.641
ls there any
sign of foul play?

28:52.586 --> 28:54.679
No.
lt's completely undamaged.

28:54.822 --> 28:56.915
Apparently,
it was just landed here.

28:59.126 --> 29:00.184
Follow me.

29:00.261 --> 29:02.388
There's something else
l want you to see.

29:13.574 --> 29:15.098
[machine beeps]

29:15.342 --> 29:16.502
(Dominic)
Who are they?

29:16.911 --> 29:18.708
These three belong
to an East German

29:18.779 --> 29:20.610
spy organization,
Schwartzkrieg.

29:21.649 --> 29:25.278
Klaus Kinter,
Else Mannheim, Eric Maas.

29:27.154 --> 29:29.452
Anastasia Zarkov,
Russian.

29:30.224 --> 29:32.385
She's a specialist in
things psychological

29:32.459 --> 29:35.428
as they apply to
the intelligence trade.

29:35.596 --> 29:36.961
Over the past
couple of years

29:37.031 --> 29:37.998
she's been quite active

29:38.065 --> 29:40.431
in behavior-modifying
drug research.

29:40.501 --> 29:42.526
Peter MacGregor Moore,
English.

29:42.603 --> 29:43.592
[Marella laughs]

29:43.671 --> 29:45.229
A mercenary
who'll work for anybody

29:45.306 --> 29:46.534
with change in their pocket.

29:46.974 --> 29:48.236
Right, left, or center,

29:48.309 --> 29:49.401
their political persuasion

29:49.443 --> 29:51.638
means nothing to him
in any way.

29:53.113 --> 29:56.139
Well, uh, what's all these got
to do with Stringfellow Hawke?

29:56.216 --> 29:57.205
Two weeks ago,

29:57.284 --> 29:59.081
Army lntelligence
stumbled onto the fact

29:59.153 --> 30:01.986
that this happy group
had arrived in the States.

30:02.056 --> 30:04.388
Obviously, they were
on a mission of some kind.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.516
There's reason
to believe that

30:05.559 --> 30:07.823
they're working
for Mustapha Kamal.

30:08.529 --> 30:09.587
So?

30:09.663 --> 30:12.325
So if you had to speculate,
what single thing

30:12.399 --> 30:14.026
would Qaddafi like
to get his hands on

30:14.101 --> 30:15.762
more than anything
else in the world?

30:15.836 --> 30:17.360
Come on, quit your kidding,
will you?

30:17.438 --> 30:18.405
Airwolf, of course.

30:18.472 --> 30:21.373
Exactly.
Then Hawke disappears.

30:21.442 --> 30:23.637
24 hours later,
we find his helicopter

30:23.711 --> 30:25.872
out here in a field in
the middle of nowhere.

30:26.447 --> 30:28.381
You think he had
a run-in with these guys?

30:28.449 --> 30:30.144
l'd bet on it.

30:31.485 --> 30:35.148
Dominic,
you know where Airwolf is.

30:35.556 --> 30:37.023
You've got to tell me.

30:37.091 --> 30:38.080
Uh-huh.

30:38.158 --> 30:39.318
lt could fall into

30:39.393 --> 30:41.452
the very worst
possible hands.

30:41.528 --> 30:43.393
l can't.
l gave String my word.

30:43.464 --> 30:45.193
Right now,
there is no String.

30:45.265 --> 30:46.960
He's been gone
over 30 hours.

30:47.067 --> 30:48.329
That's why that
chopper is just

30:48.402 --> 30:50.336
sitting out there in
the middle of nowhere.

30:51.405 --> 30:52.997
[typing]

30:58.112 --> 31:00.580
Well, how do l know this
isn't some kind of fancy scam

31:00.647 --> 31:02.478
to get me to tell
you where Airwolf is?

31:02.549 --> 31:04.608
Because it
doesn't make any sense.

31:04.685 --> 31:06.778
You know what arrangements
we have with Hawke.

31:06.854 --> 31:08.719
We're on his side.

31:08.856 --> 31:11.484
Well, that was yesterday.
What about today?

31:11.925 --> 31:13.324
You people have
a funny way

31:13.394 --> 31:15.419
of changing sides to suit
your needs, you know.

31:15.496 --> 31:16.963
Oh--
l resent that.

31:17.031 --> 31:18.623
Marella.
Marella.

31:19.633 --> 31:23.262
Dominic, we're not
just talking about Airwolf.

31:24.171 --> 31:26.332
We're talking
about Hawke's life.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.975
You've got to trust me.

31:40.421 --> 31:42.616
l don't. No.

31:42.689 --> 31:44.122
l don't.

31:44.324 --> 31:45.313
Dominic!

31:48.862 --> 31:50.762
l'm not with them,
whoever they are.

31:51.732 --> 31:52.892
Maybe.

31:53.901 --> 31:55.232
But Saint John is.

31:55.369 --> 31:56.700
That doesn't make
any sense.

31:56.770 --> 31:58.397
(woman on PA system)
Hematology, 1 1 1.

31:58.505 --> 31:59.699
Hematology, 1 1 1.

31:59.773 --> 32:00.865
Unless...

32:02.009 --> 32:03.408
Unless what?

32:07.381 --> 32:09.246
lf you're lying to me,

32:11.018 --> 32:12.349
you're dead.

32:12.419 --> 32:14.114
l'm not lying.

32:14.688 --> 32:16.383
l hope not.

32:35.142 --> 32:36.609
Good morning.

32:40.114 --> 32:41.411
Else!

32:43.817 --> 32:44.806
There.

33:15.315 --> 33:16.714
Who are they?

33:16.783 --> 33:18.114
My brother, Saint John.

33:19.119 --> 33:20.416
Which one?

33:21.188 --> 33:22.450
What?

33:22.523 --> 33:24.047
Which one is
your brother Saint John?

33:24.124 --> 33:25.455
There are two photos.

33:25.726 --> 33:27.023
That's Saint John.

33:27.161 --> 33:28.651
No, these are
two different men.

33:51.318 --> 33:52.717
Hey, come on.
Quick, quick.

33:59.193 --> 34:00.683
There never was a crash.

34:00.827 --> 34:02.419
They just wanted
me to think so.

34:03.964 --> 34:05.522
Saint John is not back.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.164
What is it?

34:07.201 --> 34:09.065
Brainwashing or
something like that?

34:09.136 --> 34:10.364
Something like that.

34:10.938 --> 34:13.202
l told them exactly
what they wanted me
to tell them.

34:13.273 --> 34:15.036
What did you
tell them?

34:15.108 --> 34:16.074
The location of

34:16.143 --> 34:18.007
a very important piece
of military hardware.

34:18.078 --> 34:19.067
Are they spies?

34:19.146 --> 34:21.045
Do you work for
the government or something?

34:23.449 --> 34:24.712
Nothing
that patriotic.

34:24.784 --> 34:26.342
Hawke here,
he works for himself.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.715
Himself and the, uh,
Firm, l should say.

34:28.789 --> 34:30.085
Right, brother dear?

34:32.092 --> 34:33.821
l'll blow her
away.

34:35.062 --> 34:36.051
Let's go.

34:53.080 --> 34:53.705
All right,
brother.

34:53.746 --> 34:55.647
Why not live
a little longer?

34:55.716 --> 34:57.741
lf you wanted me dead,
l'd already be there.

34:57.818 --> 35:00.616
There is a bonus
if we get you to Libya alive.

35:00.787 --> 35:02.448
l should've died in
that copter crash.

35:02.522 --> 35:03.716
There was no crash.

35:04.157 --> 35:07.217
Your helicopter was pre-rigged
with a radio control device

35:07.294 --> 35:09.194
and landed beautifully
by MacGregor.

35:12.099 --> 35:13.623
What made me pass out?

35:13.700 --> 35:16.191
The photograph l gave you
was soaked in a chemical.

35:16.270 --> 35:17.294
Nasty chemical.

35:17.371 --> 35:19.339
Enters the bloodstream
right through the skin.

35:19.406 --> 35:21.374
l was wearing gloves,
remember?

35:24.611 --> 35:26.238
What about her?
She's not part of this.

35:26.313 --> 35:27.905
(Hawke)
Why don't you let her go?

35:28.582 --> 35:29.981
l don't think so, Hawke.

35:31.084 --> 35:32.813
She might prove too valuable.

35:48.969 --> 35:49.958
[propellers starting]

36:08.722 --> 36:09.882
That's not going
to work.

36:10.023 --> 36:11.183
You might as well
relax.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.287
Harry Houdini
did it.

36:16.930 --> 36:18.261
Why Libya?

36:19.433 --> 36:20.422
[sighs]

36:22.636 --> 36:24.433
l vacationed
there once.

36:25.572 --> 36:27.130
You vacationed in Libya?

36:31.511 --> 36:32.944
You think we'll go nonstop?

36:33.013 --> 36:35.914
No, l got a stopover in Cuba
or maybe Nicaragua.

36:36.416 --> 36:37.678
l hope it's Cuba.

36:37.751 --> 36:39.582
l always wanted
a Caribbean vacation.

36:43.323 --> 36:45.188
Do you do things
like this everyday?

37:00.841 --> 37:02.775
There!
There it is!

37:03.744 --> 37:05.712
Is that smooth enough
for you to set down?

37:05.846 --> 37:07.814
I should think so.
Yes.

37:15.055 --> 37:16.716
Brace yourselves!

37:48.722 --> 37:50.952
How'd you like to be
untied, Stringfellow?

37:52.559 --> 37:54.117
ln exchange for what?

37:54.194 --> 37:56.526
A little flying,
just five minutes' worth.

37:57.063 --> 37:58.155
l don't think so.

38:01.935 --> 38:03.300
You can't shoot me.

38:03.370 --> 38:05.338
No one else can get
Airwolf out of the lair.

38:05.405 --> 38:08.772
You're right, Hawke.
We wouldn't shoot you.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.830
This is bloody awesome.

38:41.942 --> 38:42.931
(Hawke)
Yeah.

38:48.215 --> 38:49.204
[beeping]

39:40.400 --> 39:41.958
[conveyor belt whirring]

39:59.719 --> 40:00.743
Let's go.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.229
That's what
they were after?

40:15.302 --> 40:17.770
All this for
a lousy helicopter?

40:19.639 --> 40:20.731
Yeah.

40:27.681 --> 40:28.670
[thudding]

40:33.086 --> 40:35.486
(Kinter)
How long to reach
international waters?

40:35.555 --> 40:37.580
Fifteen minutes
to the gulf.

40:37.724 --> 40:39.749
Three more and
we're 1 2 miles out.

40:39.826 --> 40:41.521
The escort will
join us there.

40:41.861 --> 40:43.556
Fantastic.

40:51.171 --> 40:52.160
Hawke.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.998
Relax, brother.

40:55.208 --> 40:56.197
Um,

40:57.177 --> 40:59.873
why don't you let
me loosen her straps?

41:00.113 --> 41:01.580
(Hawke)
We can't go anywhere now.

41:01.648 --> 41:03.707
Then she won't need her
arms free, will she?

41:05.619 --> 41:07.086
(Hawke)
Uh, how about you, Freda?

41:07.220 --> 41:08.687
You wanna be
a little sympathetic?

41:08.989 --> 41:10.581
You could go back
into yours.

41:12.993 --> 41:14.051
Not likely.

41:14.127 --> 41:15.185
(Dominic)
Don't move

41:15.261 --> 41:18.321
or the next word you say
could be ''goodbye.''

41:25.171 --> 41:26.729
Time to call up
the escort.

41:27.974 --> 41:31.273
[speaking Spanish]

41:32.078 --> 41:34.103
So, l didn't know
what to do.

41:34.581 --> 41:36.572
So, l, uh,
flew out to the Valley

41:36.716 --> 41:39.184
and hid in Airwolf
and l waited.

41:40.587 --> 41:42.020
How long were
you going to wait?

41:42.155 --> 41:43.622
Long as it took.

41:45.992 --> 41:47.050
Now what?

41:51.431 --> 41:53.422
Well, looks like

41:53.500 --> 41:55.593
we're gonna miss our
Mediterranean vacation.

41:55.669 --> 41:57.728
lt is
the tourist season.

41:57.871 --> 41:59.099
[Dominic exclaims]

42:02.008 --> 42:03.236
(Kinter)
Here they come.

42:04.778 --> 42:06.268
Damn it, we did it.

42:06.946 --> 42:07.935
[beeping]

42:10.183 --> 42:12.174
Rear cargo doors.
lt could be trouble.

42:12.352 --> 42:13.785
[beeping continues]

42:13.920 --> 42:15.444
l'll go take a look.

42:36.009 --> 42:37.533
Release the drag chute.

42:46.853 --> 42:47.979
(Hawke)
Engage both engines.

42:48.054 --> 42:49.021
Both at once?

42:49.089 --> 42:50.181
Now!

42:52.125 --> 42:53.285
Cut the chute away.

43:34.033 --> 43:35.330
[speaking Spanish]

43:35.668 --> 43:37.295
[speaking Spanish]

43:44.911 --> 43:45.900
[continuing to speak Spanish]

44:04.197 --> 44:05.858
We've have some
MiGs on our tail.

44:07.967 --> 44:09.195
Pop a Sun Burst.

45:23.576 --> 45:24.565
No!

45:50.570 --> 45:52.435
(Hawke)
Where's that other MiG?

45:53.206 --> 45:55.800
They're heading home.
They've had it!

45:56.676 --> 45:59.201
That makes two of us.
Let's go home.

46:18.865 --> 46:20.992
You don't have
a home of your own?

46:21.467 --> 46:23.094
Of course we do.

46:24.070 --> 46:26.698
And offices in
a half-dozen locations.

46:28.174 --> 46:30.267
Then how come
you're always here?

46:30.343 --> 46:32.140
(Archangel)
You flew in with Dom.

46:32.545 --> 46:34.274
Didn't he tell
you that we found

46:34.347 --> 46:36.110
your helicopter
in the desert?

46:36.316 --> 46:37.408
Yeah.

46:38.084 --> 46:39.210
Well?

46:39.352 --> 46:40.478
Well what?

46:40.753 --> 46:41.879
Well, what happened?

46:41.955 --> 46:43.320
Did the Schwartzkrieg
grab you?

46:43.389 --> 46:45.857
Did they get Airwolf?
l mean, is it safe?

46:46.292 --> 46:47.725
Are they still
in the country?

46:47.794 --> 46:51.389
l don't know.
Yes. No. ln that order.

46:52.665 --> 46:53.757
Good.

46:53.900 --> 46:55.162
How'd you
get away?

46:55.234 --> 46:56.701
He dumped
his helicopter

46:56.769 --> 46:58.464
out of the back
of a cargo plane.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.432
You had
a civilian with you?

47:02.508 --> 47:04.703
l'm no civilian,
l'm a nurse.

47:07.046 --> 47:08.946
Susan helped me escape.

47:10.116 --> 47:12.710
So she knows where
Airwolf is hidden?

47:12.919 --> 47:15.513
ls that what you
call his helicopter?

47:18.124 --> 47:19.785
We didn't tell her the name.

47:19.859 --> 47:22.350
We thought we'd
keep that from her.

47:25.398 --> 47:26.729
So, she knows
where it is?

47:27.200 --> 47:28.565
Sorta.

47:28.634 --> 47:29.623
Sorta?

47:29.702 --> 47:30.691
Well...

47:31.738 --> 47:33.296
Should l tell him?

47:33.439 --> 47:34.997
l don't think so.

47:35.308 --> 47:36.866
(Dominic)
You're right, String.

47:36.943 --> 47:39.104
Michael's
such a blabbermouth.

47:39.278 --> 47:41.041
This isn't humorous.

47:41.180 --> 47:43.842
Oh. Hey, look.
l really don't know.

47:43.916 --> 47:46.817
l saw a lot of snow
and a lot of scenery

47:46.886 --> 47:49.081
and it all
went by very fast.

47:49.355 --> 47:51.949
Besides,
l was asleep when we landed.

47:53.026 --> 47:54.015
Thank God.

47:54.093 --> 47:55.219
Sorta.

47:56.362 --> 47:57.351
