WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:06.207
[Payson] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:06.240 --> 00:09.277
I'm not responsible
for the National Committee

00:09.310 --> 00:10.578
choosing Marty over Sasha.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.446
Yeah. Which maybe
I could live with if you

00:12.480 --> 00:14.315
hadn't had an affair
with him!

00:14.348 --> 00:17.085
You girls will not
be going to London.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.487
I'm the National Champion.
You have to take me.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.555
So I guess
you didn't tell your dad
about your mom and Marty.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.291
[Kaylie] I couldn't.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.493
My dad is dating Chloe Kmetko.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.462
I will not let my dad
buy her expensive gifts
instead of me.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.131
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Clijster.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.466
She's in Boulder
for a medical conference,

00:32.500 --> 00:35.503
and she's convinced
she can help Payson.

00:35.536 --> 00:40.040
Your father and I have something
we want to share with you.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.477
We're totally psyched
about our win here in London.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.113
It is a great
confidence-builder,

00:45.146 --> 00:46.614
and it shows we've
really jelled as a team.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.518
Now, I know you get that a lot,
but in this case,
it's really true.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.622
The six National Team girls
that just decimated
the entire EU?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.090
We're like a family.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.226
- I think I might vomit.
- Right behind you.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.362
Hey! We're watching
this for a reason.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.463
To make us feel
like even bigger losers?

01:02.496 --> 01:06.134
On the contrary. To show you
what winners look like.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.169
[Marty] It was
a big win for the USA.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.138
I'd like to thank Ms. Beals
and the rest

01:10.171 --> 01:13.274
of the National Gymnastics
Committee for their support.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.476
We need to get prepared for
the biggest meet of the year.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.612
In one month,
we are going to China.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.848
China?

01:20.881 --> 01:23.384
Wow. Will you take the same
six girls to Beijing?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.254
Or will you consider
other National Team members?

01:26.287 --> 01:29.290
For instance,
National Champion Kaylie Cruz?

01:30.258 --> 01:32.126
As always, the best will go.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.294
Liar.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.265
- Are they not the best?
- No.

01:37.298 --> 01:40.534
Then why did they go to London
while you remained
here in Boulder?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.603
Because we choked.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.472
At the last National Team
practice.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.540
Choked.
That's an understatement.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.542
And one you're now
going to pay for.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.544
Didn't we already pay
by being left behind?

01:50.578 --> 01:51.912
Unfortunately, no.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.249
They won, without you,
and now you're all
behind the eight ball.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.452
At the National Team practice
tomorrow you don't just
have to perform.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.922
You have to prove that
they need you to beat China.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.693
The girls who compete in China
will be considered the ones
to watch at the Olympics.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.596
The girls who don't, well,
they'll just fade away.

02:08.629 --> 02:12.566
And because you blew
the last practice, you need
to be flawless tomorrow.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.702
In performance and attitude.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.606
If Marty Walsh or a National
Committee member tell you
to jump, you do it.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.574
Do you understand?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.243
Yes, Sasha.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.744
I hope so.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.516
Because your careers,
your futures, your shot

02:28.549 --> 02:34.222
at going to the Olympics
in 2012, all depend on
going to this meet in China.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.261
That's all.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.433
[Lauren] Could you believe
Kelly Parker?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.735
Talking like she owned
the National Team.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.503
Well, she can't
own our heads.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.339
She would love nothing more

02:51.372 --> 02:53.641
than not to have us
as her competition.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.411
We stay home, she looks
like an even bigger star.
We have to ice her out.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.482
So, Emily.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.517
Did you ever get the story
behind your designer prom dress?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.619
I told you,
my mom's boyfriend bought it.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.422
Has he bought you anything else?
Diamond studs? Tennis bracelets?

03:08.456 --> 03:09.657
No!

03:12.260 --> 03:13.427
He didn't buy your new car,
did he?

03:13.461 --> 03:15.563
Lo, knock it off.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.764
Didn't you just hear Sasha?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.500
We have the practice
of our lives to focus on!

03:19.533 --> 03:22.736
Yeah, well, time to protect
what's rightfully ours.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.667
[woman] Life in a wheelchair,
that's the fear, isn't it?

03:53.701 --> 03:58.672
Of course it is.
Why else would you give up
the thing you were born for?

03:58.706 --> 04:01.775
And why else
would the best doctors

04:01.809 --> 04:06.414
tell you that Payson's
condition is inoperable?

04:06.447 --> 04:08.549
What are you saying?
That we shouldn't be afraid?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.418
Oh, no, you should be
very afraid.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.787
Payson, would you stand,
please?

04:15.389 --> 04:19.293
I propose to make
two incisions.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.763
One here...
and one here.

04:22.796 --> 04:27.401
I bore into the fracture
and inject a cement solution

04:27.435 --> 04:31.639
which replaces the bone
mass that was lost
due to your injury.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.741
Well, that sounds
perfectly safe.

04:35.376 --> 04:40.648
There is a chance... small...
that the cement can leak

04:40.681 --> 04:42.049
and travel to the lungs.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.551
How small?

04:43.584 --> 04:44.618
Oh, very.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.687
I have developed
a device...

04:46.720 --> 04:49.723
It's a balloon, actually,
that I insert into the fracture.

04:49.757 --> 04:54.495
And it keeps the cement in place
and stops it from leaking.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.631
I have done more than
100 procedures and had
only one failure.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.333
Wow.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.702
Wait a minute. Let's talk
a minute about the failure.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.339
Mom, do you hear this?
I could do gymnastics again!

05:05.373 --> 05:06.640
Isn't that what
you're saying?

05:06.674 --> 05:07.841
If everything goes well.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.611
And she could compete again,
this year?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.581
- That's great.
- When can we schedule this?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.549
Well, I'm only in Boulder
a couple more days,

05:15.583 --> 05:19.620
- so we should schedule this...
- We're not scheduling this.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.855
But this is my decision.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.658
Mark?

05:27.595 --> 05:29.697
Payson, your mom's right.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.533
It's a family decision.
We'll talk about this at home.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.735
Thank you, Doctor.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.375
Thank you.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.647
Mrs. Keeler?

05:49.417 --> 05:53.153
You have some resistance...
It is, of course,
understandable.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.723
Are there any more questions
you have for me?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.659
Yeah, just one.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.727
Do you have any children?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.596
Well, no. No, I don't.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.366
Thank you.

06:09.603 --> 06:13.641
What is with this? You were
supposed to return my prom dress
to your boyfriend.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.409
Honey, can't you keep it?

06:15.443 --> 06:16.677
It's $600!

06:16.710 --> 06:18.812
It doesn't matter to him.
You've worn it.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.849
It's nice to have at least
one extravagant thing
in your closet,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.551
it makes you feel
like a winner!

06:23.584 --> 06:25.519
I don't have a closet.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.421
And it makes me feel
like a charity case.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.623
I thought things weren't
serious with this guy?

06:29.657 --> 06:32.560
He was just trying to do
something nice for you.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.795
- He doesn't even know me!
- See. Extra nice.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.163
Extra creepy!

06:36.196 --> 06:39.433
- Should I be worried?
- No.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.668
Is he married?

06:40.701 --> 06:43.571
I only dated
one married man,

06:43.604 --> 06:45.739
and I learned my lesson
when his wife shot me
with that paintball gun.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.708
Which really stings,
by the way.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.543
You deserved it.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.714
This man is not married.

06:53.747 --> 06:58.018
He's a gentleman, so when and
if things get serious, proper
introductions will be made.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.858
- Where's Payson?
- She went to pick up Becca.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.927
She just left.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.996
She seemed to like
Dr. Clijster.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.664
Damn it!

07:10.698 --> 07:12.232
Let me see.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.467
I'm fine.

07:13.501 --> 07:16.504
I knew this would happen.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.673
She'd hear about the surgery
and want to have it.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.641
Nothing's been decided yet.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.611
[scoffs] It hasn't? Be honest.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.647
It was decided
the minute we walked
into Dr. Clijster's office.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.883
It was decided
when she saw how excited
you were with all of it.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.654
- That's not true.
- Are you ready to tell her
she can't have the surgery?

07:33.687 --> 07:36.023
Because the risks
are too awful?

07:36.056 --> 07:40.060
Or even if she beats the risks,
it's highly unlikely that
she'll ever be great again?

07:42.630 --> 07:45.699
I didn't think so.
So it's up to me.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.701
I get to be the 'bad' parent,
the 'mean' one.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.604
The one who has
to clean up the mess while
you go back to Minnesota.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.840
Are you gonna throw that at me,
now? I live there so I can...

07:52.873 --> 07:54.775
We had an agreement!

07:54.808 --> 07:56.677
No more doctors.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.878
We need to be
together on this.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.747
You need to support me.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.915
Dr. Clijster is only in town
for a couple of days.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.718
Can't we have a rational
conversation about this?

08:04.752 --> 08:07.888
[sighs] How dare you
call me irrational!

08:07.921 --> 08:09.857
Maybe you should just

08:09.890 --> 08:13.927
go back to Minnesota
and stay there.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.811
Uh, is there one
where you're not kissing?

08:30.844 --> 08:34.715
[chuckling] Well,
Paris is the City of Love.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.786
It looks like you guys
had a really good time.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.323
We did. But it's always
great to come home.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.559
We missed you.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.661
So, are you ready for
tomorrow's Nationals Practice?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.730
Yeah.

08:49.763 --> 08:53.333
Yeah, I got my new
double Arabian on floor!

08:53.366 --> 08:55.703
I'm gonna use it to win
over the National Committee.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.739
A double Arabian?
That's great.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.740
So I'm guessing
Marty'll be there.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.578
Yeah, well, uh,
he's our coach, so...

09:04.612 --> 09:06.914
I'm gonna go get the rest
of the luggage but

09:06.947 --> 09:09.717
I think there might be
something in there for you.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.652
[chuckles]

09:12.953 --> 09:15.756
It's really nice to see
you and Dad so happy.

09:15.789 --> 09:20.694
Well, maybe love
does conquer all, huh?

09:20.728 --> 09:24.732
I'm sorry you have to deal
with all this Marty business.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.868
I know you haven't had the
easiest time training with him.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.770
You gonna be OK tomorrow?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.739
Yeah.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.741
I'm not gonna let Marty

09:33.774 --> 09:37.678
or anyone mess with my mind
or gymnastics anymore.

09:37.711 --> 09:41.915
I know it's been difficult
for you to keep our secret.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.984
Especially from your father.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.987
I'm not gonna say anything.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.023
I wouldn't want him
to find out and be humiliated.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.729
[knocking]

09:56.096 --> 09:57.865
Oh! Hi, Lauren.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.768
You... You just missed Emily.
She left for work already.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.771
[chuckles] That's OK,
Ms. Kmetko, I'm actually
here to see you.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.005
Can I come in?

10:05.038 --> 10:08.776
Um... Yeah.
[stammers] Come on in.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.846
Is this where Emily sleeps?

10:12.880 --> 10:16.950
Yes. She insisted that Brian
have the second bedroom.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.422
Oh!

10:22.455 --> 10:26.393
Here's the Javoni.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.862
Emily told me your new boyfriend
bought her this dress.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.765
Yes, he's very generous.

10:31.799 --> 10:36.136
Almost too generous, which is
why we're giving it back.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.873
I, uh, wonder what he'd do
with a used dress.

10:39.907 --> 10:44.745
- Anyway, you remember my dad
from the gym, right?
- Uh-huh.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.714
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

10:46.747 --> 10:52.419
You know I don't have a mom
around, and I thought of you.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.022
[stammers]
Well, OK.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.725
What's up, hon?

10:57.758 --> 11:01.061
Well, ever since Summer
broke things off with Dad,

11:01.094 --> 11:04.865
he's been back to his
old womanizing ways.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.700
Womanizing?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.769
This is hard to share, but

11:08.802 --> 11:12.773
I think he might have fallen
back into his... sex addiction.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.176
I see.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.712
It's just so hard,
watching him go

11:18.746 --> 11:20.714
to a different strip club
every night,

11:20.748 --> 11:23.717
and every morning
a different woman
pouring coffee in the kitchen.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.819
I mean, I don't even want
to drink out of the same cup!

11:25.853 --> 11:26.787
They stay over?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.189
Everyone knows how dangerous
promiscuity is.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.858
He's probably
spreading diseases around

11:30.891 --> 11:33.126
to all these women who think
he's only dating them.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.262
- Oh...
- It's tragic.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.731
He was so monogamous
with Summer.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.867
- She was his true love.
- Oh.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.202
[sighs] If only they could just
get back together.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.272
What should I do?

11:45.305 --> 11:46.306
Um...

11:48.809 --> 11:50.878
Well, if I were you,

11:50.911 --> 11:53.781
I would ask him to
get professional help,

11:53.814 --> 11:56.183
remind him that his behavior's
affecting others,

11:56.216 --> 11:57.851
as well as himself.

11:57.885 --> 12:02.089
But let him know that
you love him, no matter what.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.291
Wow.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.159
I knew you'd have the answer.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.295
You're so easy to talk to.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.764
Well, I've been told
I'm pretty easy.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.901
To talk to.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.268
I should get going.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.806
Maybe I can convince Dad
not to go on the prowl tonight.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.977
- [door opens]
- Bye.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.012
- [Lauren] Bye.
- [door closes]

12:27.580 --> 12:29.216
[dialing]

12:32.219 --> 12:35.923
Steve, can you call me?
We need to talk.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.957
[closes phone]

12:46.566 --> 12:48.168
I've decided I don't want
to have the surgery.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.241
Are you sure, sweetie?

12:56.243 --> 12:59.212
Do you... [clears throat]
Do you want to talk about it?

12:59.246 --> 13:02.816
No. This is what I want.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.553
[sighs] There's no guarantee
that something couldn't
go wrong.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.857
And I'm so tired
of hospitals and doctors.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.559
I just... want to be done.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.928
We can understand that.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.598
And gymnastics?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.034
I think there are things in life

13:21.068 --> 13:24.972
that are more important.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.298
[rock music]

14:12.319 --> 14:16.256
You know, you, uh...
You don't have to hang around.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.091
I've got things under control.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.293
This is a National
practice, after all.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.029
My team.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.431
I appreciate the offer,
but I think I'll stay, thanks.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.033
I have three girls
on your team

14:26.066 --> 14:29.069
and I want to look after
their interests.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.203
What is that
supposed to mean?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.307
You didn't take any
of my girls to Europe, Marty.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.443
And one of my girls happens
to be the National Champion.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.311
That decision
wasn't just mine.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.913
It was the
National Committee's.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.449
And your girls did try
to sabotage that practice.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.051
- And me.
- We've discussed it.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.252
And it will
not happen again.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.954
I'm glad to hear it.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.060
Look, I just ask
that you look at the girls

14:53.093 --> 14:54.261
with an objective eye.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.063
These two days
are crucial for them.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.331
I have a totally
objective eye.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.201
But you have to know,
they pissed off
the National Committee.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.436
All right? I'll give them
a good practice today,

15:03.470 --> 15:05.472
but tomorrow, they've got
to bring their A game.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.506
Oh, they will.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.953
Oh, hey, Teamies!

15:19.987 --> 15:22.389
I guess that
still includes you.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.092
Where do you come from?
You're like a recurring zit.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.394
I'm sorry you girls couldn't
have joined us at the EU meet.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.498
But I guess if you had,
we probably wouldn't have won.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.465
That's in the past.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.467
We're focused on China now.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.104
And I'm still
the National Champ.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.372
Yeah, a lot of good
that's done you.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.174
No one missed you
in London, Kaylie,

15:41.208 --> 15:42.442
no one's going to
miss you in Beijing.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.544
Alright girls, gather 'round!

15:49.549 --> 15:52.085
As you know, this practice
will determine which six of you

15:52.119 --> 15:54.221
will go to China
to compete against
the best team in the world.

15:54.254 --> 15:58.391
Today's practice is about
fine-tuning and perfecting
your routine.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.527
Then tomorrow the National
Committee will help me

16:00.560 --> 16:05.498
select the final six.
So make it count.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.335
OK? Good.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.742
Did I mention Marty added
a whip to a full-in
to my floor routine?

16:15.775 --> 16:19.046
That gives me the highest D.O.D.
of anyone on the team.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.082
Think again.
Kaylie just added a double
Arabian to her floor routine.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.751
Pretty sure
that beats your full-in.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.286
What?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.520
Does Marty know about this?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.422
He will now.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.491
[upbeat music plays]

16:31.524 --> 16:33.293
* It's a beautiful thing

16:33.326 --> 16:34.327
[Kaylie] Hey, Marty!

16:39.099 --> 16:40.433
* Come on now, check it out!

16:46.606 --> 16:48.541
* Ch-ch-check it out

16:48.575 --> 16:50.577
[crowd applauding]

16:50.610 --> 16:54.414
* Movin' movin' up
to the glamarama *

16:54.447 --> 16:57.517
* Gonna break it down
my killer karma *

16:57.550 --> 16:59.619
Who's zoomin' who now?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.491
* It's a beautiful thing *

17:04.524 --> 17:06.426
[door closes]

17:06.459 --> 17:07.360
Dr. Clijster just called.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.429
She wanted to know
if we'd made our decision.

17:09.462 --> 17:13.333
[scoffs] Did you tell her that
Payson doesn't want to do it.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.469
I, um... I didn't.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.804
Why not?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.539
Because Payson does want it.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.508
And if you were honest
with yourself, you'd admit...

17:23.243 --> 17:28.381
Payson, I'm going to ask you
this one last time.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.050
Do you want this surgery?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.521
Tell us, honey.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.658
Tell us why.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.230
Because it's tearing
you guys apart!

17:44.397 --> 17:45.498
Payson.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.235
We love you.

17:48.268 --> 17:52.639
And even if it doesn't
sound like it sometimes,
we love each other.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.141
And we always will.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.509
[Kim] We want you to be
honest about it.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.346
Your father and I
are gonna be fine.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.281
- We're here for you.
- I...

18:01.314 --> 18:03.383
I still can't do it.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.552
Sweetie, why?

18:06.686 --> 18:10.157
Because I can see
how terrified you are.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.592
Mom, I can see
the fear in your eyes.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.396
My whole life, whenever I've
needed strength, or hope?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.631
I could always look to you.

18:18.665 --> 18:23.636
But when I look now,
I only see how afraid you are.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.641
If you're that scared, Mom,

18:28.675 --> 18:30.677
then I'm not brave enough
to do this.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.224
I am a winner.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.525
I deserve.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.561
I am a winner!

18:48.595 --> 18:50.397
Don't you agree?

18:52.199 --> 18:54.634
[sighs] Did you see the look
on Kelly Parker's face

18:54.667 --> 18:56.569
when Kaylie did
her double Arabian?

18:56.603 --> 18:59.306
Maybe now she'll stop messing
with Kaylie's head.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.675
Yeah, it's bad enough
she has to put up with Marty.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.616
Every time he coaches her
she's probably imagining

19:09.649 --> 19:11.584
him having sex with her mother.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.520
What?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.522
They did have an affair.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.325
[sighs heavily]

19:20.460 --> 19:21.928
I am a winner.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.364
I deserve.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.665
I am a winner!

19:50.257 --> 19:52.525
The Rock girls
are ready for war.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.261
All right, Kaylie,
pull out all the stops.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.428
Let's see your floor routine.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.630
[girl] Come on, girl.
You can do it!

19:57.664 --> 19:58.665
[girl 2] Go, Kaylie.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.500
Poor Kaylie.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.369
Must be hard.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.971
Being coached by the man
your mom had an affair with.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.673
I'm surprised your parents
are still together.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.410
Unless, of course,
your dad doesn't know.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.346
You're gonna need
more than rumors

20:13.380 --> 20:14.647
and trash talk to get to me.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.683
[laughs]
Trash talk?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.652
Kaylie, let's go!

20:19.686 --> 20:24.591
Your teammates told me all about
your mom and Marty themselves.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.726
I hope you don't think they're
really your friends.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.769
Kaylie, come on,
let's see it.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.571
I need a minute.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.683
[Kaylie] What did you tell
Kelly Parker?!

20:50.717 --> 20:51.484
What are you talking about?

20:51.518 --> 20:52.819
She knows
about my mom and Marty.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.687
And she says
you and Emily told her!

20:54.721 --> 20:56.523
What?
She's so full of it.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.857
I didn't say anything,
I swear.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.061
What?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.664
Oh, crap.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.734
Emily and I were talking
about your mom and Marty
in the bathroom earlier.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.035
But I thought we were alone!

21:09.068 --> 21:11.404
Well, obviously you weren't!

21:11.438 --> 21:12.505
And now the whole world
is gonna know!

21:12.539 --> 21:15.408
Is practice interfering with
your little get together?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.610
Kaylie, floor routine.
Right now.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.321
What was that about?

21:28.355 --> 21:30.523
Kelly Parker found out
about Mrs. Cruz and Marty.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.824
How?! Who told her?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.593
Apparently we did.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.628
She was in the bathroom.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.567
I swear, if I'm dished
one more load of drama,

21:40.600 --> 21:41.901
I'm gonna lose it.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.306
[cell phone ringing]

21:50.643 --> 21:51.644
Hello?

21:51.678 --> 21:52.779
[Steve] Look behind you.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.681
What? [gasps]
Steve!

21:54.714 --> 21:57.350
Why on earth haven't you
returned my phone calls!

21:57.384 --> 21:58.818
My phone's been glitchy.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.620
What's wrong?
Is everything OK?

22:00.653 --> 22:03.756
It's come to my attention,
that you have a problem.

22:03.790 --> 22:08.495
Nothing a course of penicillin
can't cure. [laughs]

22:08.528 --> 22:09.496
That was a joke.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.697
Which would be funny

22:10.730 --> 22:12.832
if Lauren hadn't
dropped by last night

22:12.865 --> 22:15.568
to tell me that
you were a sex addict.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.637
What? Why would she say
something like that?

22:17.670 --> 22:22.542
Because she knows about us and
she was trying to scare me off.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.744
Oh, boy.
This is bad.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.413
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.416
She was obviously desperate
to break us up.

22:29.449 --> 22:33.386
She figured out that Emily's
$600 prom dress is from you.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.523
- Oh, God.
- We've got to figure out what
to do here, Steve.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.391
For starters, I've got to
tell Emily about us

22:38.425 --> 22:39.692
before Lauren does.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.728
I should've just
told her from the beginning!

22:41.761 --> 22:44.597
If she finds out Lauren
knew before she did she's...

22:44.631 --> 22:47.366
- Uh-oh.
- What? What?

22:50.937 --> 22:52.772
[Chloe] Oh...

22:55.708 --> 22:57.577
All right, Kaylie.
Let's see that double Arabian.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.913
[girls giggling]

23:13.760 --> 23:16.629
- [girls gasping, laughing]
- [girl] Nice.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.704
* All I need
is a little time *

23:24.737 --> 23:27.907
* A little time
to ease my mind *

23:27.940 --> 23:30.610
* And all I want
is another way *

23:30.643 --> 23:31.811
I'm sorry.
Can I start again?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.580
Maybe we should take
out the double Arabian.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.583
Why? I've nailed it
a bunch of times. I can do it.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.850
If you can't do it for me
when the pressure is off,

23:37.884 --> 23:40.853
how are you gonna do it for the
National Committee when it's on?

23:40.887 --> 23:43.189
I need this move
to increase my score.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.725
What you need is to prove
you're consistent, Kaylie.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.460
That's all the
National Committee wants.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.595
Let's just stick with the
routine

23:48.628 --> 23:49.929
- you did at Nationals.
- Why?

23:49.962 --> 23:51.598
So you can take
Kelly Parker to China

23:51.631 --> 23:52.999
and leave me
at home again?

23:53.032 --> 23:54.734
Look, I know you
and the National Committee

23:54.767 --> 23:56.235
think I'm a one-hit wonder!

23:56.268 --> 23:58.571
But it's not enough
to show them I can repeat.

23:58.605 --> 23:59.672
I need to show them
I'm getting better!

23:59.706 --> 24:02.575
I know what's best for you.
You've gotta trust me.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.910
Trust you?!

24:03.943 --> 24:06.613
Trust the man who had
an affair with my mom?!

24:06.646 --> 24:08.781
How am I supposed to do that?!

24:19.726 --> 24:22.662
- You knew, didn't you?!
- Knew what?

24:22.695 --> 24:25.732
That my mother's new boyfriend
is your dad!

24:25.765 --> 24:28.701
Why all the fishing around?
Why didn't you just tell me?!

24:28.735 --> 24:31.237
Because I thought maybe
you knew and were just
keeping it a secret.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.872
Why would I keep
that a secret?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.874
So I wouldn't
put a stop to it.

24:34.907 --> 24:38.010
Having a rich stepfather would
make your life much easier.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.947
I mean, you don't even
have your own bedroom.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.651
For your information, the only
reason I'd ever keep it a secret

24:44.684 --> 24:48.721
is because I'm embarrassed
my mother would even consider
dating your dad.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.022
You're embarrassed?

24:50.056 --> 24:51.858
Of my father?

24:51.891 --> 24:53.893
What about your trashy,
hoochie-mama

24:53.926 --> 24:55.662
who can't keep
her boobs covered,

24:55.695 --> 24:57.997
even though she has every
leopard print top ever made?

25:00.767 --> 25:02.535
[Marty] Hey, hey!

25:02.569 --> 25:03.736
What's going on here?!

25:03.770 --> 25:05.905
[both] Nothing.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.007
Nothing?
It better be nothing.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.677
Emily, get over on vault.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.944
I want to see your Yurchenko.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.713
Lauren, chalk up
and get on bars.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.953
Kaylie, Kaylie.
Kaylie, wait!

25:22.789 --> 25:24.557
Is she OK?

25:24.591 --> 25:26.759
I don't know what's wrong
with her.

25:26.793 --> 25:29.028
Is this all because Marty
left The Rock to go to Denver?

25:29.061 --> 25:32.599
It's not because Marty
went to Denver,

25:32.632 --> 25:34.767
it's why
he went to Denver.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.804
If I tell you something, do you
promise to keep your cool?

25:42.809 --> 25:43.843
OK, come on.
You're up, Emily.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.111
Let's go.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.880
[rock music]

25:53.620 --> 25:59.091
* Breathe
all the air around you *

25:59.125 --> 26:03.663
* The only thing left
that's free *

26:03.696 --> 26:07.767
* Store it in your tissue

26:07.800 --> 26:10.770
* Tell the time is now

26:16.142 --> 26:18.778
Two down, one to go.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.148
What's that supposed to mean?

26:22.181 --> 26:24.817
Kaylie threw a hissy fit
and stomped out of practice,

26:24.851 --> 26:26.853
Emily just flubbed
a remedial vault.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.122
So that just leaves you.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.624
Although, it's a wonder
how any of you

26:31.658 --> 26:33.359
can focus at all
in spite of your mothers.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.962
I mean, Emily's
is a fashion victim,

26:35.995 --> 26:38.030
Kaylie's is an adulterer,

26:38.064 --> 26:40.366
and didn't I hear
your mother abandoned you

26:40.399 --> 26:42.802
when you were a little girl?

26:42.835 --> 26:44.737
Have you heard
from her lately?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.673
[gasping]

26:47.840 --> 26:51.878
My eyes! My eyes!
Oh, my God! I can't see!

26:51.911 --> 26:56.182
Sasha, I thought you
said your girls
were gonna have it together.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.798
Hey... hey, Kaylie.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.766
I gotta go pack.
I need to get out of here.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.834
I just got off the phone
with Summer.

27:14.867 --> 27:18.137
She said you walked out
of practice. What happened?

27:18.170 --> 27:22.675
I told Marty that I know
you had an affair with him.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.912
[sighs] Why would you do that?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.947
Because he expects me
to trust him.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.082
And I can't do that.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.785
I feel like I'm betraying Dad
by knowing what Marty did

27:32.819 --> 27:35.722
and letting him stand there
and make a fool of us all!

27:35.755 --> 27:38.224
I don't know how he can coach me
as if he's done nothing wrong!

27:38.257 --> 27:39.926
But I can't be a part of this.

27:41.928 --> 27:45.832
I made a terrible mistake
with Marty.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.702
But I made a worse mistake
when I asked you

27:49.736 --> 27:52.138
to keep my secret...

27:52.171 --> 27:56.108
...my lie,
from your father.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.145
- And for that I am truly sorry.
- It's fine.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.880
I'll just quit
the National Team.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.715
No, you will not.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.084
I will not let you pay
the price for what I did.

28:05.117 --> 28:10.757
I can't take it back, and I
can't get you a different coach,

28:10.790 --> 28:15.928
but... I can take
away some of your burden

28:15.962 --> 28:18.765
by telling your father
the truth.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.172
Thank you.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.807
Dr. Clijster!

28:27.840 --> 28:29.241
Mrs. Keeler.
What can I do for you?

28:29.275 --> 28:31.277
Isn't there
any more you can tell me

28:31.310 --> 28:34.981
about this procedure that will
help me know this will work out?

28:35.014 --> 28:38.117
I could give you all
these studies and analyses.

28:38.150 --> 28:42.755
But I'm afraid that
wouldn't give you what you need.

28:42.789 --> 28:43.823
What I need here is faith.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.158
I'm trying,
but I just don't have it.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.526
That's where you're wrong.

28:47.559 --> 28:52.031
You seem to have abundant faith
that this won't work.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.167
You're placing all your faith
in a negative outcome.

28:55.201 --> 28:59.538
I wish I could help you,
but the choice doesn't come

28:59.571 --> 29:02.809
from other people,
it comes from inside you.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.212
I have to go.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.197
Emily, there's no door there.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.565
I can still see you.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.934
Go ahead, see me.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.936
I have nothing to hide from you!

29:29.969 --> 29:33.039
Mr. Tanner, Mom? Mr. Tanner?

29:33.072 --> 29:34.874
What about The Rock's
no-dating rule?

29:34.907 --> 29:38.544
I don't work out
at The Rock. You do.

29:38.577 --> 29:43.082
And that policy
doesn't apply to parents,
Miss Kettle-Black-Pot-Caller.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.818
Couldn't you find a man who
didn't have a kid at The Rock?

29:45.852 --> 29:47.253
Honey...

29:50.322 --> 29:54.260
We have been out
to dinner twice.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.329
And I'm gonna call
it off with him.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.832
You're not going
to see him anymore?

29:59.866 --> 30:01.200
No.

30:01.233 --> 30:04.003
Not if it upsets you this much.

30:04.036 --> 30:08.140
Did you have feelings for him?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.878
It's not worth finding out.

30:11.911 --> 30:15.814
You are my priority, and I'm
just gonna tell Steve that.

30:16.983 --> 30:21.220
Honey, I'm sorry
that you had a bad day.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.355
It was a disaster.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.092
I feel like if we don't go
to China, our careers are over.

30:26.125 --> 30:30.629
- Honey.
- [phone ringing]

30:30.662 --> 30:34.333
[Chloe] Is that one of the boys
you're not dating?

30:34.366 --> 30:37.403
It's Sasha.
He wants us back at The Rock.

30:37.436 --> 30:41.640
Tonight? Well, what's up?

30:41.673 --> 30:42.508
I don't know.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.211
But after today,
I'm afraid to find out.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.955
Hey. I was thinking
we should do Italy next.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.289
Rent a car, drive
through wine country?

30:57.323 --> 31:00.626
- Alex...
- Umbria, Tuscany...

31:00.659 --> 31:04.363
What's wrong? Is it Kaylie?

31:04.396 --> 31:07.233
We need to talk.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.902
There's something
I have to tell you.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.446
Look, we know we
screwed up today.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.215
We're so sorry.
We didn't mean...

31:23.249 --> 31:24.917
[Sasha] Actually...

31:26.152 --> 31:29.922
...I screwed up.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.224
I set a bad example.
How can I expect you
to control your emotions

31:32.258 --> 31:34.060
when your coach
can't even control his?

31:34.093 --> 31:37.163
Personally, I thought
you were awesome.

31:37.196 --> 31:40.099
- [scoffs]
- We've totally blown it,
haven't we?

31:40.132 --> 31:43.069
No, you haven't.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.372
Today was a nightmare day, but
I just had a meeting with Marty.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.941
And he agreed, under the
circumstances, that today

31:48.975 --> 31:51.210
was a private practice
and will remain so.

31:51.243 --> 31:55.147
Tomorrow the National Committee
will be observing you
with a completely clean slate.

31:55.181 --> 31:57.216
Marty assures me that
you all have as good a chance

31:57.249 --> 32:01.253
as any of the girls
of going to China.
But you have to bring your best

32:01.287 --> 32:04.690
and you focus on nothing
but kicking ass.

32:04.723 --> 32:05.924
Can you do that?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.430
Can I get a "rock on"?

32:11.463 --> 32:15.101
- One, two, three.
- [all] Rock on!

32:17.369 --> 32:20.239
I envy you, Mark.

32:20.272 --> 32:25.477
It's so easy for you
to get behind this surgery.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.747
When I close my eyes,
I see Payson,

32:28.780 --> 32:31.083
paralyzed...

32:31.117 --> 32:35.221
...or miserable or even worse.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.523
I have reservations,
just like you.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.993
But you have hope.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.729
And you believe.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.333
For me, that feels
like jumping off a cliff.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.436
I'm trying,
I'm really trying.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.205
But I can't.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.740
And she needs me to do it.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.143
Maybe you don't need
to find hope.

32:57.176 --> 33:02.014
Let go of the fear,
and maybe if you do that,

33:02.048 --> 33:03.515
hope will find you.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.018
[scoffs]

33:06.052 --> 33:07.419
What are you so afraid of?

33:07.453 --> 33:10.422
Oh, God.
What am I not afraid of?

33:10.456 --> 33:12.424
You? You're so strong.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.426
Oh!

33:14.460 --> 33:17.363
I was terrified when Payson
was five years old

33:17.396 --> 33:20.499
and started swinging
off the bannister.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.534
And I was afraid every time

33:22.568 --> 33:27.039
she learned some new
death-defying trick.

33:27.073 --> 33:31.210
[crying] And I was afraid when
I let her take the cortisone!

33:31.243 --> 33:32.578
Hey. It's OK.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.813
No, it's not!

33:34.846 --> 33:36.548
I knew she was too hurt!

33:36.582 --> 33:41.187
And I knew I shouldn't let
her take the cortisone!

33:41.220 --> 33:44.156
- [Mark] What
are you talking about?
- Payson got hurt on my watch.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.592
I never should have let her
take the cortisone.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.561
I never should have let her
compete injured.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.564
This is all my fault!

33:54.566 --> 33:56.435
[sighs]

33:57.469 --> 34:00.372
I ruined our daughter's life,

34:00.406 --> 34:03.309
and I can't make
that mistake again! I can't!

34:03.342 --> 34:04.376
That's not true.
Don't do this to yourself.

34:04.410 --> 34:07.579
There's no such thing
as your watch or my watch.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.082
I don't look at it that way.
And I know Payson doesn't.

34:10.116 --> 34:13.419
This accident would've happened
with or without the cortisone.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.555
You can't hold
yourself responsible.

34:16.588 --> 34:19.091
You can't.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.493
And you can't let that feeling
of responsibility keep

34:21.527 --> 34:25.831
the one hope Payson has
to live out her dream! It's
not your fault, Kim! It's not.

34:25.864 --> 34:29.201
Don't make it your fault!

34:32.338 --> 34:35.841
And you can do this.
And you can hope.

34:35.874 --> 34:38.244
She's gonna be OK.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.379
This is the right thing to do.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.650
Maybe I can start
to believe that.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.286
Hey, I'm scared too.

34:47.319 --> 34:52.524
Why don't we just do what we
do with everything else?

34:52.558 --> 34:55.661
Side by side.

34:55.694 --> 34:59.431
- We jump over
that cliff together.
- [laughs]

34:59.465 --> 35:01.367
OK. [crying]

35:17.549 --> 35:19.185

35:19.218 --> 35:21.520
The National Committee
is ready to observe.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.190
- We've got some big decisions
to make today.
- Yep.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.591
Let's get started.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.694
This is it.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.691
Double Arabian.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.687
- [woman on PA] Dr...
- OK, are we ready?

37:35.721 --> 37:38.424
[clears throat] Yes, we are.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.726
We are, right?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.594
You betcha.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.796
We'll be waiting here for you
when you get out.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.835
And we'll be there
on the sidelines when
you go to the Olympics.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.603
I love you, Mom.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.508
You too, Dad.

37:56.542 --> 37:57.776
Thanks for believing
in my future.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.602
Way to go, girls.
You nailed it.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.836
Looks like we're
going to China.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.472
OK, could everyone
gather around, please.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.377
[Marty] We've made our
final decision.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.846
As you all know, the competition
was very tight today.

38:34.880 --> 38:38.350
But of course we can only
take six of you to China.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.352
Congrats to the
following girls:

38:40.386 --> 38:42.421
[Marty] Tara.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.890
Renae.

38:45.757 --> 38:46.692
Kelly.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.864
Lauren.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.339
Beth.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.677
And lastly...

39:05.711 --> 39:06.712
It's you.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.550
Andrea.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.656
I'm going to China!

39:18.824 --> 39:20.859
I can't believe this.

39:25.897 --> 39:29.635
But it won't be as much fun
without you guys.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.571
"But I'm the National Champ."

39:32.604 --> 39:35.674
Don't you get it, Kaylie?
No one cares.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.775
Your reign is over.

39:41.179 --> 39:44.616
Emily Kmetko had
a fantastic day.

39:44.650 --> 39:45.951
Kaylie Cruz
was perfect out there.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.252
She even nailed
a double Arabian.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.989
Which, I understand,
Marty told her to
take out of her routine.

39:52.658 --> 39:53.892
What's going on here?

39:53.925 --> 39:56.695
We're confident with
the team we took to the EU.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.497
Why mess with success?

39:58.530 --> 39:59.831
Because my girls are better
than some of the girls

39:59.865 --> 40:01.633
on your supposed dream team.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.536
Your girls are inconsistent
in performance and attitude.

40:04.570 --> 40:05.571
They were consistent today.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.439
And yesterday they were
storming out of practice

40:07.473 --> 40:09.608
and throwing chalk
in their teammate's eyes.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.978
And we heard they weren't
the only ones out of control.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.713
He told you.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.750
Mr. Belov, we know more
than you think we do.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.620
Well, since the National
Committee is so well informed,

40:21.653 --> 40:24.490
you'll know why Kaylie Cruz
has had problems
with Marty as her coach.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.459
Let's not get into
unsubstantiated rumors. Look.

40:27.493 --> 40:28.727
Our money's on
Kelly Parker.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.230
Hers is the image the gymnastics
association wants to project.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.634
That is total bull,
and you know it!

40:35.667 --> 40:37.703
Look, Belov.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.606
We weren't thrilled
when we heard you were
coming out of retirement

40:40.639 --> 40:42.741
to coach this club,
and we were right.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.676
There might be some sports
where a rogue coach

40:44.710 --> 40:46.545
and his renegade athletes
are prized.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.780
But that is not gymnastics.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.617
Marty and Kelly Parker can be
counted on to toe the line.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.485
It is a sport of discipline.

40:53.519 --> 40:54.920
You and your girls?

40:54.953 --> 40:57.022
You let your passion
run away with you.

40:57.055 --> 40:57.923
Our passion?

40:58.857 --> 40:59.925
Come on.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.893
Emily Kmetko does
street routines.

41:01.927 --> 41:05.697
Kaylie Cruz has one good day,
but she's an emotional mess.

41:05.731 --> 41:07.866
And Payson Keeler
pushed herself so hard...

41:07.899 --> 41:10.536
Well, we all know
what happened to her.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.672
We're going to stick to
the girls we can keep in line.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.851
Hey.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.624
I still can't believe this.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.761
What the hell happened?

41:36.795 --> 41:38.764
I don't know.

41:41.032 --> 41:46.572
I feel like it was finally all
flowing for me today, you know?

41:48.874 --> 41:52.711
Today I felt like
I really deserved it.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.949
What do we do now?

41:57.983 --> 41:59.885
I don't know.

42:13.699 --> 42:18.937
If it's any consolation,
I totally hate Chinese food.

42:22.340 --> 42:25.977
What did they see in you
that they didn't in me?

42:26.011 --> 42:28.814
I'm National Champion!

42:31.717 --> 42:33.952
Thanks for the support,
Kaylie.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.931
I'm the renegade coach?

42:45.964 --> 42:47.733
You're the one
who committed adultery.

42:47.766 --> 42:48.934
You're the one
who crossed every boundary.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.602
You're the one
who abandoned these girls.

42:50.636 --> 42:52.070
- Calm down, Sasha.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.739
This is the kind
of reactiveness

42:53.772 --> 42:54.906
the Committee sees
in you and your girls.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.775
Are you kidding?
I thought we agreed

42:56.808 --> 42:58.009
you weren't gonna tell them
what happened yesterday.

42:58.043 --> 42:59.344
Whoa, I didn't.

42:59.377 --> 43:02.881
I didn't.
I give you my word.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.651
For what it's worth.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.824
- What happened?
- This isn't fair, Sasha!

43:12.858 --> 43:14.893
No, it isn't fair.
It's politics.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.629
The National Committee decided
even before they came here

43:17.663 --> 43:19.631
that you girls
didn't deserve to go to China.

43:19.665 --> 43:21.399
Why?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.669
They think we're
a rogue gym.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.037
So what should we do?

43:26.071 --> 43:28.907
They think we're renegades now?

43:28.940 --> 43:30.742
They haven't seen anything yet.
