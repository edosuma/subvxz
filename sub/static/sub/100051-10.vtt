and she has us.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.635
- Hey, she's not here.
What about his house?

09:08.678 --> 09:10.288
- She's not there, either.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.551
Carisi, is there someplace

09:11.594 --> 09:13.335
that she mentioned
that she goes at night?

09:13.378 --> 09:17.382
Someplace like Gamblers
Anonymous, or--or--or a class?

09:17.426 --> 09:18.558
- Only thing I can think about

09:18.601 --> 09:20.168
is last week
I had called about a DD5.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.170
She said she was at a shooting
range, had to call me back.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.693
- She told me that
she was at the shooting range

09:23.737 --> 09:24.781
a few days ago.

09:24.825 --> 09:25.826
- Twice in two weeks?

09:25.869 --> 09:27.349
- Rodman's Neck?
I'll call.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.611
- Yeah.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.134
- Okay, did TARU
get back to you

09:30.178 --> 09:31.962
on the location of Rollins'
phone when she called me?

09:32.006 --> 09:33.050
- Not yet.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.225
- It's a recording.
- So, just go.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.882
We're waiting on the GPS
on their cars.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.102
Bucci's ex-captain doesn't know
where he is or--

09:41.145 --> 09:42.756
- How the hell does Bucci
keep his gun

09:42.799 --> 09:43.887
after that meltdown
in the hospital?

09:43.931 --> 09:46.411
- Carisi,
this guy is retired NYPD.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.587
You know how difficult it is

09:47.630 --> 09:50.415
to file a red flag petition
on them.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.416
- Yeah, I know.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.592
But if he doesn't have his gun,

09:52.635 --> 09:53.593
this whole thing
plays out differently.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.811
That son of a bitch Getz.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.421
He gets his lawyer
to offer a plea deal,

09:56.465 --> 09:58.293
the whole time he knows he's
got Judge Ellery in his pocket.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.903
- Carisi, this is not on you.

09:59.947 --> 10:00.861
- I don't know
how these guys are connected,

10:00.904 --> 10:02.645
but I'm gonna find out.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.777
If Rollins gets shot over this,

10:03.820 --> 10:05.169
I'm gonna take all of them out.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.780
- Okay, Carisi.
Just take a breath, let's--

10:06.823 --> 10:07.824
[inhales deeply]
Let's breathe.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.913
♪

10:09.957 --> 10:12.176
- Shut up, shut up.
Let me think.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.571
- I'm not lying to you.
You know me.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.225
Put the gun down.
Walk away.

10:17.268 --> 10:20.402
- It's too late.
I took a civilian hostage.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.664
- Did you?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.710
Or did you come here
to get counseling?

10:23.753 --> 10:25.581
- I threatened her captain.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.365
- I can honestly say that--
that you

10:27.409 --> 10:30.673
were under extreme stress
and that we resolved the issue

10:30.717 --> 10:31.674
[stutters]
at the end of the session.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.458
- Frank, you're NYPD.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.851
So you lost it

10:34.895 --> 10:37.985
when the man who raped
your daughter walked away?

10:38.028 --> 10:40.117
God, nobody's gonna wanna
come after you.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.990
- It doesn't solve my problems.
No one wants to go after Getz.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.818
He laughed at me in court,

10:44.861 --> 10:46.428
and now he's got my daughters
on a boat

10:46.471 --> 10:47.734
God knows doing what.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.257
He needs to be stopped.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.128
- We'll get him.
Frank, we'll get him.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.435
We'll keep investigating,
you have my word.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.741
- No, you said that before.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.220
This guy's got
too much leverage.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.179
- This isn't the way
to bring him down!

11:00.050 --> 11:02.574
You already said it, right?
You know the drill.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.228
My car's parked
right out front.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.577
They'll GPS it.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.667
My phone--you smashed it,
but they'll track it.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.239
- You're right, okay?

11:15.283 --> 11:17.328
You're right, all right?

11:17.372 --> 11:19.504
I got a new plan.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.767
Yeah, new plan.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.076
- Hey, did you get anything?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.991
- The shooting range
was a dead end.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.167
They haven't seen Rollins
in a year.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.952
- So wherever Rollins
said she was going,

11:31.995 --> 11:33.301
that was just a cover story?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.433
Where is TARU with the
cell phone, with the GPS?

11:35.477 --> 11:36.783
- Her latest ping,

11:36.826 --> 11:39.655
they narrowed it down
to West 80s west of Broadway.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.744
- Wait, West 80s?

11:41.788 --> 11:42.745
Uh, this is weird.

11:42.789 --> 11:43.877
There's a 911 relay

11:43.920 --> 11:46.488
for Dr. Alexis Hanover,
an NYPD shrink.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.924
- Hanover?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.404
That's the one that we did
the interview training with.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.058
- Her son just alerted
her police supervisor,

11:51.101 --> 11:52.712
Leo Vanek, to a situation.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.278
- What kind of situation?

11:54.322 --> 11:56.498
- I have no idea, but it's at
her home office at West 83rd.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.673
- You think Rollins

11:57.717 --> 11:58.979
could've started
seeing Hanover privately?

11:59.022 --> 12:00.328
- If she did, she
wouldn't have told any of us.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.416
- Okay, let's go.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.724
[equipment rattling]

12:04.767 --> 12:05.942
You try again?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.335
- Straight to machine.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.206
- Hanover's cell keeps going
to voicemail.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.773
- I found Bucci's car
a block over

12:10.817 --> 12:12.166
and Rollins' Jeep
down the street.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.037
- Her gun was
in her glove compartment.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.343
- So she's unarmed?

12:15.386 --> 12:18.215
- She can handle herself,
Carisi.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.348
- We got a situation
on the pole cam.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.917
- Let's move.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.754
Dr. Hanover.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.625
- Check the back,
search every room.

12:36.668 --> 12:37.887
- I'll check the building.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.934
- [muffled whimpering]

12:43.023 --> 12:44.589
- Are you okay?

12:44.633 --> 12:46.156
- I'm okay.

12:46.200 --> 12:46.983
- Okay.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.768
Okay. Where's Rollins?

12:48.811 --> 12:51.466
- She's gone.
He took her.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.083
.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.303
- Can you tell my son
that I'm okay?

13:02.346 --> 13:03.826
- Already did.
He'll meet you at Mercy.

13:03.870 --> 13:04.827
- Okay.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.525
- Hey.
She give us anything?

13:07.569 --> 13:09.658
- She said Bucci
was highly agitated.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.313
He's escalating.
He does not have a clear plan.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.618
- You didn't need a shrink
to tell us that.

13:13.662 --> 13:14.881
- Well, he doesn't know

13:14.924 --> 13:16.056
where he's going
or how he's gonna get there.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.144
- How was Rollins?

13:17.187 --> 13:18.232
- She's staying calm, you know.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.755
Holding her own.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.626
- Maybe I shouldn't ask this,
but she knows the guy.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.367
I mean, is there any chance
she's in on it

13:23.411 --> 13:26.109
or maybe lost perspective?

13:26.153 --> 13:27.154
- No.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.329
- And yeah, you're right--

13:28.372 --> 13:29.330
you shouldn't have asked.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.679
- Okay,
Bucci smashed his phone.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.812
Even if we do arrest Getz,
how's he gonna know?

13:32.855 --> 13:36.250
- He told Dr. Hanover that he
wanted to see it on the news.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.208
- So he's headed somewhere
with a TV?

13:38.252 --> 13:39.731
That's his plan?

13:39.775 --> 13:41.864
- Maybe his wife and his kids
know where he would go.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.171
Fin and Kat,
go back to the pier

13:44.214 --> 13:45.825
and wait for Getz's party boat.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.436
[sighs]

13:51.004 --> 13:53.049
- Hey, I'm sorry
for what I said about Rollins.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.182
- You'll be a great detective,
you just gotta--

13:55.225 --> 13:56.705
- Think before I open my mouth?

13:56.748 --> 13:58.533
- And before you go
off the playbook.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.491
I mean, you just gotta
think more in general.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.320
- Copy that, Sarge.
- Here they come.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.495
- You've been here
this whole time?

14:04.539 --> 14:05.714
Give us some space.

14:05.757 --> 14:06.846
- We're not here for you.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.108
- This time.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.544
- Is there a problem?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.502
- We need to talk
to Donna Bucci.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.417
- Oh.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.768
- Donna, girls?
You need to come with us.

14:16.812 --> 14:17.639
- Why?

14:17.682 --> 14:18.945
- Is this about Daddy?

14:18.988 --> 14:20.033
- Yes, it is.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.904
- Donna, call me
if you need anything.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.993
- You missed a hell of a party,
Kitty.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.084
- What's my husband done now?

14:29.825 --> 14:30.782
Frank...

14:30.826 --> 14:33.960
took some woman cop hostage?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.483
Great.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.354
[laughing]
He's out of control.

14:37.398 --> 14:41.315
- Mrs. Bucci, do you have any
idea where he may have gone?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.447
- A vacation place,
a buddy's house?

14:43.491 --> 14:45.493
- He doesn't have friends.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.930
He has chippies.

14:47.974 --> 14:51.151
He'd tell me he was
working overtime on a case

14:51.194 --> 14:53.153
and I'd get the E-ZPass bill.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.676
He'd gone upstate for two days.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.982
- And where would he go?

14:56.025 --> 14:57.766
- He'd tell me?

14:57.809 --> 15:01.857
What's he angry about,
the girls having fun?

15:01.901 --> 15:05.034
We had a great time.
We saw the Statue of Liberty.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.950
- Okay, how did--how did you
end up on the boat?

15:07.994 --> 15:12.041
- That nice woman, Granya,
called me at rehab.

15:12.085 --> 15:16.089
Said Ivy and Milly were invited
to a party on Steve's yacht

15:16.132 --> 15:20.006
and they wanted me to be there
as, like, a guardian.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.572
He even sent a limo.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.444
- What do you know
about Steve Getz?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.315
- What Ivy tells me.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.970
He's a cool guy.
Rich.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.320
He pays her to model,

15:30.364 --> 15:32.757
and Frank's so blind
with jealousy

15:32.801 --> 15:34.455
he's getting in the way
of her career

15:34.498 --> 15:35.456
like he did with mine.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.328
- So, Mrs. Bucci--

15:38.372 --> 15:41.636
this is gonna come as a shock.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.726
Steve Getz is a pedophile.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.903
He's having sex with Ivy.

15:50.471 --> 15:51.776
- What?

15:54.127 --> 15:56.042
I don't believe it.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.173
- It's true.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.567
- She was gonna testify
against him.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.178
- I'm her mom.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.658
She'd have told me.

16:03.701 --> 16:04.920
And it can't be true.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.315
She was very sweet with him
at the party.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.794
- Mommy.
- Sorry, Captain.

16:09.838 --> 16:10.839
The girl was crying.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.493
- Oh, come here, baby.

16:12.536 --> 16:15.235
- Mommy, I'm scared.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.411
- I'm taking you home.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.847
You and Ivy.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.286
- Ivy, I know you feel
powerless right now,

16:23.330 --> 16:24.679
like Steve is in control.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.812
- He is,
just admit it.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.032
Besides,
nothing happened tonight,

16:30.076 --> 16:31.903
and he paid
me and Milly anyway.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.122
- Okay.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.255
- So my mom and I
can take Milly home?

16:35.298 --> 16:38.867
- Where, to her rehab?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.783
Ivy, your dad
is in serious trouble.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.698
- I told you,
I don't know where he is.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.787
- Has he tried
to contact you at all?

16:45.830 --> 16:48.398
- Check if you want.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.531
You're such a cop.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.795
No matter what my dad does,
Steve will never get caught.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.319
He knows everybody.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.538
Some girl on the yacht

16:57.581 --> 16:59.627
was bragging she parties
with that judge.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.107
- What judge?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.717
- Judge Joe.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.024
The one who practically
called me a whore.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.374
Meanwhile, he's the one
who likes to get spanked.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.679
- I knew it.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.724
- Do you know
this girl's name?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.117
- No.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.379
- Okay, Chief, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.815
- Tess, maybe?

17:13.858 --> 17:16.557
Um, she was Russian.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.732
- What, Carisi?

17:17.775 --> 17:19.777
- Judge Joe Ellery--
Getz owns him.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.170
It's not the crime,
it's the cover-up.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.606
- Okay,
what does she look like?

17:22.650 --> 17:25.392
- Reddish hair, pale.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.002
Look, do I have to be here?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.743
I'm tired and I wanna go home.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.049
- [scoffs]

17:30.092 --> 17:31.615
Ellery's been going
to Getz's parties.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.921
He's having sex
with underage girls.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.009
No wonder
he lets him off the hook.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.315
- Well, it could
give us leverage.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.403
- If we can prove it.

17:36.446 --> 17:37.752
- When we searched
Getz's mansion,

17:37.795 --> 17:40.102
we found a camera
and an SD card

17:40.146 --> 17:43.584
with photos of his cronies
partying with young girls.

17:43.627 --> 17:44.889
Maybe we get lucky.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.895
Look who turned up
on Getz's camera.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.376
- The Honorable Judge Ellery.
Do we have an ID on the girl?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.465
- Tessa Valenko.
We interviewed her earlier.

17:55.509 --> 17:58.120
She's been having sex with Getz
and according to Ivy,

17:58.164 --> 17:59.730
spanking sessions
with the judge.

17:59.774 --> 18:00.992
- Now, full disclosure:

18:01.036 --> 18:02.907
she's not asserting rape,
and she is 17.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.735
- Anything else
connect Ellery to Getz?

18:04.779 --> 18:06.955
- Ellery and Getz's lawyer,
Abrams?

18:06.998 --> 18:08.348
Fraternity brothers at Yale.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.132
- We also have a security guard
on the block

18:10.176 --> 18:12.308
who puts Ellery at Getz's
parties on a regular basis.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.701
- All circumstantial.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.094
We're talking about
going after a sitting judge

18:15.137 --> 18:17.618
on the bench 30 years
with an impeccable record.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.880
Hadid's on board with this?

18:18.923 --> 18:20.011
- I didn't think it was worth

18:20.055 --> 18:21.448
bringing to her attention
at this point.

18:21.491 --> 18:22.536
- Copy that.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.754
Still no leads on Rollins?

18:23.798 --> 18:25.016
- No contact for six hours

18:25.060 --> 18:27.802
and Bucci moved her
from the initial location.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.369
- We can't afford to wait.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.806
Let's wake up Judge Ellery.
Bluff him.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.721
No texts, emails,
nothing in the system--

18:33.764 --> 18:35.766
not until Detective Rollins
is safe.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.118
- [exhales deeply]
Thanks.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.120
- All right.
- You--you wanna?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.295
- No, no.
Don't worry about me.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.297
Go ahead.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.994
- Frank, I could use
something to eat.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.517
- Yeah, so you can
make a run for it?

18:47.561 --> 18:48.866
- I'm just--
I'm hungry.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.172
Aren't you hungry?

18:50.216 --> 18:52.827
- We'll get breakfast later.
Do you have any cash?

18:52.870 --> 18:54.002
- [scoffs]

18:54.045 --> 18:55.351
You're really not good at this,
are you?

18:55.395 --> 18:56.700
- Hey.
- No, no, listen.

18:56.744 --> 18:57.701
I didn't--I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.

18:57.745 --> 18:58.746
- Seriously?

18:58.789 --> 19:00.008
- Look, you did good.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.444
You boosted our ride,
that was great.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.880
- Yeah.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.317
- And you've gotta be careful
'cause they're gonna

19:04.360 --> 19:05.840
be checking stolen vehicle
reports, you know that.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.102
- I switched out the license
plates when you were napping,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.104
so keep your mouth shut,
get in the car.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.106
- Okay.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.194
But I just--

19:12.238 --> 19:14.718
I have a three-year-old
at home

19:14.762 --> 19:16.111
that doesn't sleep
through the night.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.158
She wakes up
and I'm not there...

19:19.201 --> 19:20.115
- Here's the thing
about being a cop.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.203
When you leave in the morning

19:21.247 --> 19:22.552
they never know
if you're coming home.

19:22.596 --> 19:23.597
You hear me, sweetheart?

19:23.640 --> 19:24.554
- Okay.
- They never know.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.077
- I know, but okay.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.253
But you don't care about my
daughters, what about yours?

19:27.296 --> 19:28.732
Listen,
what about Ivy and Milly?

19:28.776 --> 19:29.733
- Yeah.
- What do you think that--

19:29.777 --> 19:31.039
- Call your girls,
call your girls.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.562
Go ahead.
Make it quick.

19:32.606 --> 19:33.520
Make the call.

19:33.563 --> 19:34.738
- Okay.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.393
I'm not gonna screw your over.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.394
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.395
- Just do it.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.573
- Hey, Sienna.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.053
Hi.
Yeah, it's me.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.837
Everything--everything's okay.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.883
Um, is Jesse asleep?

19:48.926 --> 19:50.276
Yeah, she's right there?

19:50.319 --> 19:51.320
Okay, yeah--

19:51.364 --> 19:52.234
- Come on!

19:52.278 --> 19:55.281
- Baby, hi.
It's Mama.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.283
No, I'll be home soon.
Okay.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.589
- Get down, get down, get down.
- Ow--what?

19:59.633 --> 20:01.025
What, what?

20:01.069 --> 20:01.983
- Yeah.
- Frank, what?

20:02.026 --> 20:03.419
- What'd I tell you?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.116
- Frank--okay, okay, okay.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.422
I wasn't trying to screw you.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.554
- Screw me over?

20:07.597 --> 20:09.077
You tell me my kids need a dad?

20:09.120 --> 20:11.993
Don't you forget,
your girls need a mom.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.561
I'll shoot you right here
if I have to.

20:14.604 --> 20:15.997
- Okay.

20:22.960 --> 20:23.309
.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.572
- What about private
security cameras?

20:25.615 --> 20:26.529
It's the Upper West Side,
everybody's wired.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.965
- I checked
all the footage we have.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.272
Rollins and Bucci were caught
on foot by a traffic cam

20:30.316 --> 20:33.275
at 83rd and Columbus
at 9:35 heading west.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.276
We lose 'em after that.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.451
- What about the subways?

20:35.495 --> 20:37.453
- I checked subways, too.
No sign of 'em.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.368
And there's no report
of stolen vehicles

20:39.412 --> 20:41.544
and no hits on Bucci's
or Rollins' credit cards.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.285
[cell phone buzzing]

20:43.329 --> 20:45.244
- Tutuola.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.810
What?

20:46.854 --> 20:48.421
When?

20:48.464 --> 20:49.596
Okay, Sienna.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.511
Is the officer
still there with you?

20:51.554 --> 20:52.990
He's gonna need
to take your phone.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.820
Rollins called Jesse
a few minutes ago.

20:56.864 --> 20:57.865
No caller ID.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.780
- A burner cell.
They can trace that.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.956
- Okay, you call the captain.
I'll call TARU.

21:01.999 --> 21:02.957
- Okay.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.310
[knock on door]

21:10.443 --> 21:11.835
- What the hell is going on?

21:11.879 --> 21:14.229
- Sorry to wake you,
but it's a matter of urgency.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.665
We need a no-knock warrant.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.451
- At this hour?
What's this about?

21:18.494 --> 21:19.843
- Steve Getz.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.631
- Everything all right, Joe?

21:24.674 --> 21:27.634
- Fine, dear.
Go back to bed.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.375
Let's talk in the library.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.469
That girl was 17.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.818
- What about the others,
Your Honor?

21:37.861 --> 21:39.515
And we will find the others,
trust me.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.561
- None of them were underage.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.215
- I'm not sure your wife
will see that as redemptive.

21:44.259 --> 21:45.913
- We know
that you and Getz's lawyer

21:45.956 --> 21:47.349
were at the same fraternity
at Yale.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.655
We also know that you've been

21:48.698 --> 21:50.657
going to parties at Getz's
townhouse for years now.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.615
- I've done nothing illegal.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.009
- You should have
recused yourself from the case,

21:55.052 --> 21:57.359
not put a hand on the wheel
until it was assigned to you.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
- Cases are assigned randomly.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.493
- We've already spoke

22:00.536 --> 22:02.625
to the chief administrator
who was on duty that day.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.628
- I will not be bullied,
intimidated.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.021
- One of my detectives

22:07.064 --> 22:09.023
is being held at gunpoint
by the victim's father.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.026
The victim you called a whore
in court.

22:12.069 --> 22:15.290
- So, this can go a few
different ways, Judge Ellery.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.813
Now--you don't help us

22:16.857 --> 22:18.989
and that detective dies,
what happens

22:19.033 --> 22:22.079
to your relationship
with the NYPD after that?

22:22.123 --> 22:24.995
Your career, your marriage.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.563
Not to mention you're gonna
have blood on your hands.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.914
- What do you want?

22:30.958 --> 22:31.915
- [sighs]

22:39.358 --> 22:40.794
- Where are we going?

22:40.837 --> 22:43.057
- You don't need to know.
- [stutters]

22:43.100 --> 22:44.450
Well, we need to get to a TV

22:44.493 --> 22:46.234
'cause they could've
arrested Getz already.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.496
- They haven't.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.802
I've been checking the news
on the radio.

22:48.845 --> 22:49.890
- [groans]

22:49.933 --> 22:51.544
I just--I wanna know
what the plan is.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.328
- Jesus,
you sound like my wife.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.765
Like Donna, except Type A.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.507
She's not exactly
whatever you are--

22:58.551 --> 23:00.509
perfectionist.

23:00.553 --> 23:01.989
- You really don't know me.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.078
- What I don't get
about you is,

23:04.121 --> 23:05.819
why someone like you
was seeing a shrink.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.473
- [scoffs]

23:07.516 --> 23:10.127
Made plenty
of bad choices, Frank.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.172
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.739
I mean, I--
[sighs]

23:12.782 --> 23:13.957
I got two kids
by two different dads--

23:14.001 --> 23:15.872
guys I slept with
for no good reason.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.354
My career?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.182
I've been a third grade
detective for eight years.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.966
- What's holding you back?

23:25.142 --> 23:26.970
- I am, I guess.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.498
You're better at this
than Dr. Hanover.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.151
[groans]

23:34.195 --> 23:35.414
Frank, come on.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.458
Just--just let me--

23:36.502 --> 23:37.894
let me out of these cuffs,
come on.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.766
- I do that, you bolt.
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.115
I'm not gonna do anything.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.725
- You're trying to play me.
It's not gonna work.

23:42.769 --> 23:43.726
- I'm not gonna play you,
I just--

23:43.770 --> 23:45.772
- Yeah, come on.
- Come on, Frank.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.774
My arms are killing me,
I've got no circulation,

23:47.817 --> 23:49.123
my nose itches,
there's something in my eye.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.298
- All right, all right,
all right, I promise--

23:50.341 --> 23:51.560
- Let me go.

23:51.604 --> 23:52.996
- If you stop talking,
I'll pull over.

23:53.040 --> 23:53.997
- Okay.

24:01.614 --> 24:05.139
- [sighs]
Jesus, Joe.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.357
It's 4:00 a.m.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.533
- I couldn't sleep.

24:07.576 --> 24:10.057
- You have nothing
to worry about, Joe.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.232
Or do you?

24:11.275 --> 24:13.147
- I went out on a limb
for you, for Steve.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.932
- Joe, you're in no position
to shake us down for more.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.674
- The NYPD
searched Getz's townhouse.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.808
What if they found
photos, video?

24:21.851 --> 24:23.505
This could blow up
my whole life.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.985
- Just relax, please.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.161
Come on, they found one camera
when they searched.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.946
Party photos, that's it.
Nothing explicit.

24:29.990 --> 24:32.427
The good stuff?
Your hanky spanky?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.473
It's in my office.
Safe.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.126
Lawyer-client privilege.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.781
- There you go.
Call Hadid for a warrant?

24:38.825 --> 24:40.827
- No, Garland said
to keep this off the grid.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.612
- You think Hadid
is gonna tip off Getz?

24:43.656 --> 24:46.397
- Not on purpose,
but the people above her?

24:46.441 --> 24:48.661
- Better yet, deleted.
- Can't take that chance.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.184
- Nothing's gonna happen, Joe.

24:50.227 --> 24:53.274
Tell Granya
to delete my contacts.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.928
- Are you sure?

24:54.971 --> 24:57.713
Granya's about to fly in three
girls from Paris this weekend,

24:57.757 --> 25:01.630
all under 15,
for Steve's birthday.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.284
You wanna be second up?

25:03.327 --> 25:04.851
- Are you not listening to me?

25:04.894 --> 25:07.680
- You need to calm down.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.160
