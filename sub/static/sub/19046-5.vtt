WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.468
That's a good shirt, Charlie.
I like it. You should buy that.
You like it?

00:02.470 --> 00:04.503
Yeah.
Okay, stand a little
to your left, please.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.606
- Why?
- Dee, just a little bit
to your left?

00:07.608 --> 00:09.541
Why, Charlie?
So I can steal it.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.410
No, you're not
gonna steal it.
Just buy the shirt.

00:11.412 --> 00:15.280
Dee, it's fine. It doesn't even
have, like, the exploding
ink thing on it. We're good.

00:15.282 --> 00:19.184
Oh, great news. I'm not
getting arrested with you.
So buy it.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.719
[ Scoffs ]
What is the point?

00:20.721 --> 00:23.489
The point is that
you have, like,
four articles of clothing.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.558
And that's it for years
and years and years now.
So buy something new.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.161
All right, first of all,
this place is a rip-off, okay?

00:29.163 --> 00:33.298
Secondly, someone should
teach these people how to do
a decent hem, don't you think?

00:33.300 --> 00:34.767
Oh, are you unsatisfied
with that hem?

00:34.769 --> 00:37.302
Very unsatisfied with the hem.
What do you know
about hems, Charlie?

00:37.304 --> 00:40.239
I've been sewing my clothes
back together for, like,
almost my entire life.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.275
I know a thing or two
about a hem, Dee, all right?
Well, that's just sad.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.811
Well, it's not sad.
It's a very valuable skill set.
So, you know--

00:45.813 --> 00:49.481
Just try the shirt on
and buy it.
All right.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.152
[ Woman ]
Shut up!

00:53.520 --> 00:57.222
- Shut up! Dee Reynolds?
- Yeah.

00:57.224 --> 01:01.593
Ingrid! Nelson.
From high school.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.129
Ingrid Nelson?
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.

01:04.131 --> 01:08.667
You look so different.
What happened to all
of the fat parts?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.836
I lost 'em!
I lost a ton of weight!

01:10.838 --> 01:14.573
Wow!
And look at you.
You look so beautiful.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.675
Aw.
You don't have
that hideously,

01:16.677 --> 01:19.645
ugly, disgusting
back brace anymore.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.113
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.183
Oh, God! We were such losers
in high school!
Mmm.

01:24.185 --> 01:27.486
Do you remember what
people used to call us?
Uh, I don't remember.

01:27.488 --> 01:31.256
The Aluminum Monster
and Fatty Magoo!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.424
Yeah, that was it.
Remember?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.928
Yeah. Yes.
You were the Aluminum Monster!
I was Fatty Magoo!

01:35.930 --> 01:37.463
Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.
Hey, do you remember...

01:37.465 --> 01:42.401
how you used to say that
you were gonna be famous and
have your own clothing line?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.636
Did I say that?
Oh, my God. Every day.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.739
Every day, it
was "famous actress this"
and "famous model that."

01:47.741 --> 01:51.810
And all the kids did
was laugh at you.
That is a good memory.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.580
Well, no.
I mean, it inspired me.

01:54.582 --> 01:59.485
I thought to myself,
"If the Aluminum Monster
can do it, then so can I."

01:59.487 --> 02:02.754
Oh!
Dee, you're in my store!

02:02.756 --> 02:05.824
This is your store?
Yes!

02:05.826 --> 02:08.260
Wow!
[ Laughs ]

02:08.262 --> 02:10.262
All this, yours?
Yeah.

02:10.264 --> 02:14.366
Gosh!
Hey, so, did you
ever do any of the--

02:14.368 --> 02:16.935
Are you a model now?
Are you-- Did you--

02:16.937 --> 02:18.670
Well, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

02:18.672 --> 02:22.541
Not-Not-Not-- Yeah.
Not right now...
because I'm shopping.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.410
Did you go to law school?
Oh, my God, I did!

02:25.412 --> 02:27.880
You did?
Yeah, for a little while.
I loved it.

02:27.882 --> 02:32.417
God, you must be so busy.
I'm so busy.
So busy that I have to go.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.753
But it was really
excellent to see you.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.422
Oh, it was so good
to see you too.
Oh, and congratulations.

02:37.424 --> 02:41.527
I would love to hang out.
Hang out? We're gonna hang out!
We're gonna do that!

02:41.529 --> 02:43.328
We're gonna do all of that!
Okay.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.963
[ Laughs ]

02:44.965 --> 02:46.732
Charlie. You're not
gonna believe this.
Hmm?

02:46.734 --> 02:50.702
I just ran into the biggest
loser from my high school.
And she owns this store!

02:50.704 --> 02:52.838
Really?
I used to say
all this stuff about...

02:52.840 --> 02:55.674
how I was gonna be big and
famous to keep her down.
Oh, yeah.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.545
But it did the opposite.
It, like, inspired her or
something, which is terrible.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.247
I'll tell you what. Calm down.
Here's what you do, all right?

03:02.249 --> 03:04.783
Pop on a couple things,
slip 'em on, we'll walk
right out of here.

03:04.785 --> 03:09.421
No. No, that's not good enough.
I gotta beat her at
her own game. Charlie?

03:09.423 --> 03:13.425
Mm-hmm?
I got a fatty
to take down.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.859
Dee, how's your design
coming along?

03:47.861 --> 03:49.461
I can't believe
you stole that shirt.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.631
Come on. I steal lots of things.
You don't have to get
all huffy about it.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.999
Let me take a look.
No. It's not ready
for looking.

03:54.001 --> 03:58.270
Let me take a look-see. I'll
tell you if I like it or not.
Charlie, I'm not ready.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.538
What are you guys working on
over there?

03:59.540 --> 04:03.442
Dee's designing a dress
to put her old nerd friend
back in her place.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.311
- Oh, which nerd friend?
- Um, the fat one.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.647
- Ingrid Nelson.
- Ingrid-- Oh, Fatty Magoo?

04:08.649 --> 04:11.049
That's right.
Oh, your old sidekick.
What's she been up to?

04:11.051 --> 04:14.353
Well, she owns her own,
like, clothing store now,
right?

04:14.355 --> 04:15.988
So Dee's making a dress.
I'm gonna help her sew it.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.890
Because according to Dee,
I'm a loser too.
Did you know this?

04:18.892 --> 04:22.060
But, Sweet Dee, being
a winner's not something
that you can become.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.963
It's something that
you're kind of born with.
Like me.

04:24.965 --> 04:25.964
Like us.
Like me.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.799
All right, let me take
a look at this.
No, hold on.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.303
Let's just peek at it.
I feel like you're
gonna make fun of it.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.738
It's not done yet.
[ Laughs ]

04:32.740 --> 04:35.440
Dee, when did--
What is this? Is it a boat?
Oh, no.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.075
No, it's--
It's a boat with
a triangle in it.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.378
It's not a boat.
[ Charlie ] No, there's
a cup and a straw.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.780
Oh, it's a--
It's a cocktail dress.
That's a strap.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.348
Is it a raincoat?
It's not a raincoat!

04:43.350 --> 04:46.752
Oh, no. That's a plug.
It's a lightbulb.
Well, in my head, it's very--

04:46.754 --> 04:50.956
It's elegant.
It-- I'm having a hard time
putting it out onto paper--

04:50.958 --> 04:53.925
Yeah.
Through your hands? Have your
hands been smashed with hammers?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.360
What is wrong with you?
Smashed with hammers?

04:55.362 --> 04:58.297
You're definitely not gonna be
putting anybody in their place
with a drawing like this.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.565
Let me give it a shot.
Dennis, take a stab at it.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.101
I'm gonna start
with the breasts.
Oh, naturally.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.837
- Come on!
- [ Charlie ]
Oh, those are beautiful.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.707
Bountiful.
Gorgeous, right?
I would say so.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.375
Oh, yeah!
You see? Okay?

05:10.377 --> 05:12.511
That is some good--
Then we move on
to the waist.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.845
[ Whistles ]
Yes.
Delicate, precise.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.449
Damn, dude, you can draw.
I'm getting kind of, like,
a little flustered here.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.985
Yeah, well,
that's understandable.
She's a nice looking lady.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.821
I'll tell you what, dude.
How about I take
this sketch, right?

05:22.823 --> 05:26.792
And then I talk to
Frank about, you know,
a really good sewing machine.

05:26.794 --> 05:30.462
And then I whip up
a prototype--
Oh, of my designs?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.764
What? You dick!
Charlie, come on!
I thought we were a team!

05:32.766 --> 05:35.934
Relax. I'm still gonna help
you make your raincoat
with the straw on it.

05:35.936 --> 05:39.938
It's not a raincoat! What is
this? This woman doesn't
even have a rib cage.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.474
Doesn't matter, Dee.
Because winners always win.

05:42.476 --> 05:46.478
You're not a winner. You're not
a winner because you used
to be popular in high school.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.947
But I think you peaked.

05:51.751 --> 05:55.921
Peaked? Peaked, Dee?

05:55.923 --> 05:57.589
Mmm.
[ Chuckles ]

05:57.591 --> 06:01.626
Let me tell you something.
I haven't even begun to peak.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.628
And when I do peak,
you'll know.

06:03.630 --> 06:08.934
Because I'm gonna peak so hard
that everybody in Philadelphia's
gonna feel it.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.069
I'm in my prime.
And I bet you...

06:11.071 --> 06:15.741
that I could sell these dresses
to Fatty Magoo just based
on these sketches alone.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.978
And your loser friend
is gonna buy 'em
because she's a fatty.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.147
And that's just
the way of the world.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.983
All I have to do
is turn on my winning charm...

06:24.985 --> 06:28.587
and Fatty Magoo
will be putty in my hands.

06:28.855 --> 06:32.758
'Cause us winners always win.
He wasn't talking about you.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.528
I... think he was.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.997
It's too streaky.
Where?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.031
Everywhere. Fix it.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.368
Well, I'm trying, Frank!
I've never spray-painted
a chair before, okay?

06:43.370 --> 06:44.970
Why are you covering
your mouth?

06:44.972 --> 06:48.807
Because that lead paint
is extremely toxic.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.709
What? Is that why
I'm feeling so dizzy?

06:50.711 --> 06:55.147
Hey, all I'm hearing is excuses.
And I still have
a blotchy chair.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.983
Wait a second. Wait a second!
What am I saying?
What am I doing here?

06:57.985 --> 07:02.487
You're making my chair look
like it was dipped in gold.
Now get back to work.

07:02.489 --> 07:06.191
Nobody is stupid enough
to think that your chair
was dipped in gold, Frank.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.860
- Why am I helping you?
- Because I'm manipulating you.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.830
That's the way I get people
to do things for me.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.865
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.234
Shit, that's awesome.
How did you do that?
Yeah.

07:16.236 --> 07:20.105
If you make my chair look
really nice, I will tell you.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.573
Deal!
[ Laughs ]

07:21.575 --> 07:23.141
I got you.
Oh, great. Oh, good, good.
Excellent.

07:23.143 --> 07:28.113
I need to use your business
connections to see if I can get
a really cheap sewing machine.

07:28.115 --> 07:32.150
Why?
Dennis and I are gonna make
a dress, see if we can sell it.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.753
You're gonna go
in the garment business?
No, dude.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.655
I'm not going into
the garment business, okay?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.957
I'm just gonna make one
single dress with Dennis.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.793
Who's gonna run the operation?
It's not an operation, dude.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.162
Look, I just want your help
getting a sewing machine.

07:44.164 --> 07:48.733
Whoa. Wait. Has that chair
been dipped in gold?

07:48.968 --> 07:51.536
So we would cinch it up nice
and tight through the waist,

07:51.538 --> 07:53.605
giving a nice, subtle lift
to the top of the dress,

07:53.607 --> 07:55.707
and keeping those
fat tummies in check.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.510
Gorgeous.
Okay, Dennis, I'm confused.

07:58.512 --> 08:04.015
Why's that?
These are just pictures
of women with giant breasts.

08:04.017 --> 08:04.983
Yeah.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.754
And in some of these sketches,
the women aren't
even wearing clothes.

08:09.756 --> 08:13.124
Yes.
Well, why?

08:13.126 --> 08:15.193
Listen, let me level
with you.

08:15.195 --> 08:19.264
You're an attractive enough
girl. I mean, certainly you've
got some potential. All right?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.100
There's no reason for you to be
so nervous around me.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.669
Why don't you just order
a couple of my dresses,

08:24.671 --> 08:29.741
and maybe if you're lucky,
I'll even make one special
just for you.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.576
And if you look good enough
in it, hell,

08:31.578 --> 08:34.312
I might even consider
having sex with you.
[ Laughs ]

08:34.314 --> 08:36.681
How does that sound?
Terrible.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.550
[ Laughs ]
All right.
Let's just calm down.

08:38.552 --> 08:42.721
You're having a reaction.
That's understandable.
It's the nerd in you talking.

08:42.723 --> 08:47.292
Why don't we start over?
How many of my dresses
would you like to order?

08:47.294 --> 08:47.959
None. Not one.

08:47.961 --> 08:53.031
I'm not gonna take "no" for an
answer because I just refuse to
do that because I'm a winner.

08:53.033 --> 08:58.069
And winners, we don't listen
to words like "no," or "don't,"
or "stop."

08:58.071 --> 09:01.940
Those words are just not
in our vocabulary.
I know what you need.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.709
You need to see my dress
on a model.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.077
I'll tell you what.

09:06.079 --> 09:10.015
I'm gonna come back tomorrow
with a model.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.784
- Please don't do that.
- Save your breath, Ingrid.

09:12.786 --> 09:18.189
Those words
have never worked on me.
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:20.726 --> 09:26.398
Look, I am so confused.
Why does she have light bulbs
growing out of her neck?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.700
Light bulbs? What?
Those are shoulder pads.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.636
What?
Yeah. You know what?
I'll walk you through it.

09:31.638 --> 09:35.273
No. I don't even want to--
Why don't you just help me
make Dennis's designs?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.208
Because Dennis's
designs are terrible.
I enjoy them.

09:37.210 --> 09:41.246
I know you do. I walked in and
saw you enjoying them very much
this morning in the bar.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.149
This again. I told you
I was scratching myself, Dee!

09:44.151 --> 09:46.217
You were scratching hard
and very vigorously. So--

09:46.219 --> 09:49.354
No. 'Cause that's
the only way I can--
It must've really itched.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.089
All right. All right, fine.
What is this thing?

09:51.091 --> 09:54.025
That is Dennis's prototype.
Be careful with that.
No, I know it's the prototype.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.195
But I don't get how it works.
[ Groans ] You're asking
a million questions!

09:57.197 --> 10:00.732
All right, look.
I'm just gonna have to walk you
through it, all right?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.033
