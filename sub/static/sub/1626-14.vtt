00:05.206 --> 00:07.606
Max, that car
has been parked outside

00:07.608 --> 00:08.841
For a week now.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.676
Do you think
they're selling drugs?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.177
Let me rephrase that.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.680
Are they selling drugs
to you?

00:14.682 --> 00:19.218
No. They're not
buying either.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.021
Hi. We have a new
mochaccino cupcake.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.455
Oh, no. No, no, no.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.358
That car's not with us.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.060
Well, that's
the third customer

00:28.062 --> 00:30.963
That didn't stop
because of that rap car.

00:30.965 --> 00:34.333
To be fair, this place
wasn't walmart on back Friday

00:34.335 --> 00:36.368
Before the car showed up.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.137
I'm gonna go ask it to move.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.973
Cool. I'll tell your horse
you died brave.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.208
Stupid, but brave.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.045
At least take this pan,
and cover the part

00:46.047 --> 00:47.946
You want to get shot in
the least.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.418
Hi. Can I talk to you
for a second?

00:52.420 --> 00:55.521
I need to see your head
at all times.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.090
[rap music blaring]

00:58.092 --> 01:02.728
First of all,
they're obsessed with me.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.297
Second of all,
I handled it.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.498
Aah!

01:06.500 --> 01:09.001
Have I been shot?

01:25.285 --> 01:27.619
Well, I did it.
I saved the neighborhood.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.154
You had a car towed.

01:29.156 --> 01:32.124
You didn't burn down
the bed bath & beyond.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.660
It wasn't the blue one
with the tinted windows,

01:34.662 --> 01:36.562
Aka, the murder car?

01:36.564 --> 01:39.298
Aka, the murder car?

01:39.300 --> 01:42.468
Tell me that's the name
of the make and model,

01:42.470 --> 01:45.137
Like, "the toyota murder."

01:45.139 --> 01:48.240
Are you sure you're not thinking
of the honda stabbing?

01:48.242 --> 01:51.410
Caroline, some guy stopped by
asking for you

01:51.412 --> 01:54.413
With a festive bandana
and a teardrop tattoo.

A festive bandana

01:57.151 --> 01:59.485
Are you sure
it wasn't my mother?

01:59.487 --> 02:01.587
He said he wanted to talk to you
about his car,

02:01.589 --> 02:02.955
So I gave him your number.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.290
Han!
I thought
he was your friend.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.293
I don't have friends
with tattoos.

02:08.295 --> 02:12.431
I don't even have friends
with split ends.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.633
You gave
a stranger my number.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.103
Your number, your email,
and your address.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.805
What?
You're a busy girl.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.007
I didn't know the best way
for him to reach you.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.743
Oh, my god.

pick-up, dead meat.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.781
What does that mean?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.517
It means it's never
a good idea to have

02:31.519 --> 02:33.852
A car with
tinted windows towed.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.787
That's rule number one.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.589
I thought rule number one was,

02:37.591 --> 02:40.259
"always wipe
front to back."

02:40.261 --> 02:42.694
Max, I'm worried.
Me too.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.764
I thought it was
back to front.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.834
What's up, nat king cool?

Oh, look, max,
it's your boyfriend.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.114
He's not my boyfriend.
We just made out.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.749
I make out with people
all the time.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.951
I made out with a guy
in the diner last week.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.586
That wasn't making out.

03:07.588 --> 03:11.123
He was choking,
and you gave him mouth-to-mouth.

03:11.125 --> 03:14.426
Yeah, but it led to sex.
Go away.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.462
Hey, max, I came in
to ask you something.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.199
They're natural,
and they hurt my back.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.100
I also wanted to know

03:22.102 --> 03:23.936
If you want to hang
tomorrow night.

03:23.938 --> 03:27.105
We could watch tv
with our shirts off.

03:27.107 --> 03:30.576
Maybe. And I'll buy you
some dinner if you put out.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.211
Ooh, so like a date.

You want to throw $15
at my thing?

03:39.486 --> 03:41.386
Great.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.256
I usually charge $5.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.992
You came all the way here
to ask me out?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.560
I'm old-fashioned.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.762
Plus, I dropped my phone
in the toilet.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.298
See ya tomorrow.
Okay.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.568

Okay, han,
I can't hold you up anymore.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.257

the murder car go by,

04:18.259 --> 04:19.658
Out the bathroom window.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.727
What exactly did you see?

04:21.729 --> 04:24.363
A car.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.065
No, seriously, I think
it followed me home.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.900
Well, three years ago,
you followed me home,

04:28.902 --> 04:30.836
So we're even.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.739
There you go, nancy.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.274
Okay, I'm off on my date.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.775
You can't
leave me here alone.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.443
There's a murder car
out there.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.046
Relax.
No one is after you.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.514
Oh, really?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.116
What about the person
who yelled,

04:44.118 --> 04:47.286
"watch yo back, bitch,"
when we were walking home?

04:48.454 --> 04:51.757
That was me,
to that girl scout.

you're carrying thin mints,

04:54.194 --> 04:57.062

thin mints.

tonight, right?

04:59.600 --> 05:00.999
I'm kind of afraid.

I've never been here
alone at night.

If you don't want to be alone,
why don't you call han?

05:05.005 --> 05:08.040
Very funny.

05:08.042 --> 05:11.443
I did. Han's busy.

He's going to a country
square dance on <i>second life.</i>

05:14.448 --> 05:15.881
It's an online game,

05:15.883 --> 05:18.183
But he says
it's more of a lifestyle.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.985
Don't you have to have
a first life

05:19.987 --> 05:21.853
To have a second life?

Max, please stay.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.823
Call deke and cancel,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.958
Or else you might come home
to find me in a pool of blood.

Oh, I always wanted a pool.

Oh, no, it's them,
here to kill me.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.301
It couldn't be. I haven't paid
them all the money yet.

05:36.303 --> 05:40.305
Oh, hi, girls.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.808
You know, I just came
from the dentist's office.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.777
Did you know that
michael jackson died?

05:47.246 --> 05:49.514
Oh, and farrah fawcett too?

05:49.516 --> 05:52.317
Oh, no, I've got to sit down.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.053
Well, since you're here,

05:55.055 --> 05:56.722
Do you want to stay
and have a girls' night?

05:56.724 --> 05:59.057
Oh, that's sounds like fun.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.926
It's just me and you.
Max has a date.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.328
And caroline's afraid
to be alone.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.932
Well, if you don't want
to be alone,

06:06.934 --> 06:10.402
Then why do you act
the way you do?

06:13.172 --> 06:14.906
I got to go meet deke.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.908
We are going out
to get wasted,

06:16.910 --> 06:18.577
Hopefully to the point
of blowing chunks

06:18.579 --> 06:20.112
On each other's shoes.

06:20.114 --> 06:23.014
But imagine it a little
less romantic than it sounds.

06:30.490 --> 06:34.192
Well, caroline,
it's just me and you.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.827
I know. I thought
it'd be fun if--

06:35.829 --> 06:38.096
Well, we tried.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.166
Good night.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.668
Don't go.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.504

are after me.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.340
You know, in poland,
when the cossacks came,

06:48.342 --> 06:50.008
We would boil water

06:50.010 --> 06:52.043
And then throw it
in their faces

06:52.045 --> 06:54.012
And then make soup.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.782
Anyway,
have a good one.

Rula? Yes.

07:02.122 --> 07:05.657
No, I have absolutely nothing
to do tonight.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.263
Well, nancy, looks like
it's just you and me.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.734
Yep, you and me
and this magazine from 2009.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.136
Ah, 2009--

07:18.138 --> 07:21.473
The last year
I had anything.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.141
Let's see, nancy.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.776
What are
we gonna read here?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.279
"new york city
more dangerous than ever."

07:27.281 --> 07:29.448
Okay, that's it.
We're done.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.316

07:31.318 --> 07:33.318
That's just a horn, right?

07:33.320 --> 07:34.986
Or is it a signal?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.055
No offense, nancy,
but we really need a dog

07:37.057 --> 07:39.558
In this situation.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.262
Oh, guess what.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.097
We happen to be
in my neighborhood.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.833
Oh, you are smooth.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.935
Also, you aggressively
steered me here

07:49.937 --> 07:52.938
And stopped at a bodega
to buy me condoms.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.773
So you want to come back
to my place, and...

07:54.775 --> 07:57.909
â™ª brown chicken

07:57.911 --> 07:59.544
Brown chicken what?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.646
You know, "bowm chicka
bowm bowm," but I made it...

08:01.648 --> 08:04.549
â™ª brown chicken,
brown cow â™ª

08:04.551 --> 08:06.751
So you thought of that
in your head,

08:06.753 --> 08:08.987
And your brain was like,
"that's okay to say"?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.423
No, my brain was like,
"don't say it,

08:11.425 --> 08:13.225
Don't say it, don't say it,
don't say it."

08:13.227 --> 08:14.426
And then it was...

08:14.428 --> 08:16.828
â™ª brown chicken,
brown cow â™ª

08:16.830 --> 08:19.331
Well, this is me.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.899
What do you want me to say--

08:20.901 --> 08:22.667
"congratulations.
You live in a building"?

08:22.669 --> 08:24.436
No, that would be lame.
I don't live in a building.

08:24.438 --> 08:27.873
I live here.
Where?
All I see is a dumpster.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.508
<i>(deke)</i>
<i>yeah, it's my apartment.</i>

08:29.510 --> 08:32.244
I converted it,
and I live inside.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.778
It's totally green.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.447
I mean, it's horrible
for the environment,

08:35.449 --> 08:36.948
But it's the color green.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.051
Oh, you're not kidding.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.455
You live in a dumpster?

08:43.457 --> 08:47.125
This is usually the part
where the girl says

08:47.127 --> 08:49.261
She has to be
up early tomorrow

08:49.263 --> 08:51.763
Or call the police.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.932
So do you have to go?

08:53.934 --> 08:55.667
Yeah.

08:55.669 --> 08:59.638
I have to go inside
the freakin' cool dumpster.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.108
And if you think
it's cool now, watch this.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.082
My dumpster's a grower,
not a show-er.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.289
Holy crap.
This is amazing.

09:17.291 --> 09:20.191
You have a sink in here
and a stove.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.027
Is it heated in here,
or did you teach the rats

09:22.029 --> 09:24.162
To shovel coal
into the engine?

09:24.164 --> 09:27.332
Yes, but there's also
solar panels on the roof

09:27.334 --> 09:28.900
And a microwave

09:28.902 --> 09:31.836
And a bathroom right here.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.005
You have a microwave
next to your toilet?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.674
You're a genius!

09:35.676 --> 09:38.577
That's the smartest way
to eat a burrito.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.211
I think of everything.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.513
And if you don't like
your neighbors,

09:41.515 --> 09:43.648
You push your house
to a new street.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.749
Or you could
just kill them

09:44.751 --> 09:46.518
And throw their bodies
in here.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.587
Added bonus--no rent.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.021
And the chinese restaurant
next door

09:50.023 --> 09:52.090
Always tosses their garbage
on my roof.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.559
Free delivery, yo.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.428
You don't have to tell me.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.731
I read all about this place
in "dumpster living."

09:59.733 --> 10:01.700
I'll take it.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.169
All right, but it comes
with a very handsome

10:04.171 --> 10:06.671

with hair that gets him

10:06.673 --> 10:09.107
Followed by security
at macy's.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.176
I'm not just saying this
'cause you live in a dumpster,

10:11.178 --> 10:12.410
But I'll take some...

10:12.412 --> 10:14.212
â™ª brown chicken,
brown cow â™ª

10:14.214 --> 10:17.349
Right now.
[chuckles]

10:18.684 --> 10:20.452
[sighs happily]

10:20.454 --> 10:23.054
So what was your first time
having sex in a dumpster like?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.857
A lot like the other times
I've had sex in a dumpster.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.226
Next time
I'm gonna be naked.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.795
Next time
I won't be wearing this hat.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.130
[yawns]

10:32.132 --> 10:34.032
I hope you don't mind.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.868
I sleep like this.
Aah!
Get off me.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.438
Oh, so nice to have a live body
under me for a change.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.207
Stop!
You're crushing me!
Mm.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.343
[chuckles]

10:49.081 --> 10:50.649
This is really nice.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.318
Yeah, it is.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.654
I got to go.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.122
You got to go?

10:57.124 --> 10:59.858
Yeah, I live, uh,
all the way over by the diner.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.227
Plus, I got to
pull these boots on.

11:02.229 --> 11:06.564
And I got a horse and a cat,
possibly a dead roommate, so...

11:06.566 --> 11:09.000
Right. You got to
be up early.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.335
Yeah, but not like that.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.337
It's just, like--

11:12.339 --> 11:14.239
Where's the door handle?

11:14.241 --> 11:16.341
Is it the coffee pot?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.842
I can't get out.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.477
I'm used to climbing
out of these things.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.846
Ah, it's right here.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.849
Oh. Sure you
don't want to stay?

11:24.851 --> 11:28.586
Chinese restaurant
just delivered.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.202
[car horn honking]

11:44.204 --> 11:45.570
There's that horn again.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.939
There is no way
this is not about us.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.577
Max, it's me again--
why do you even have a phone

11:52.579 --> 11:54.245
If you're not
gonna pick it up?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.848
And also,
you are a grown lady.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.117
Why is your
outgoing message a fart?

11:59.119 --> 12:02.520
[sighs]

12:02.522 --> 12:04.489
And I am sure you're
in the middle

12:04.491 --> 12:06.591
Of having very silly sex,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.426
But it is a nightmare
around here.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.361
Chestnut, nancy, and I are
all convinced

12:10.363 --> 12:11.830
That the murder car
is still circling

12:11.832 --> 12:13.665
And about
to take us all out.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.734
[scoffs]
so self-involved.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.205
This water
is taking forever to boil.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.940
The best I could do now
is offer the killers

12:21.942 --> 12:24.809
Warm tea
before they dismember me.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.545
That'd be funny
if you got jokes.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.047
[car horn honks]

12:29.049 --> 12:32.217
Okay, guys,
here's the plan.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.789
If they come in that door,
we go out this door.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.325
F they come in that door,
chestnut, you block them,

12:40.327 --> 12:42.026
And, nancy,
you go for their eyes.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.796
[door rattling]

12:44.798 --> 12:46.664
You know what? Let's just
say our good-byes now.

12:46.666 --> 12:47.699
Boil, boil, boil.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.668
[door rattling]
no time!

12:50.670 --> 12:52.804
Whoever you are,
I have a pot

12:52.806 --> 12:56.374
Of pretty hot water!

12:57.409 --> 12:58.977
Wha--oh!

12:58.979 --> 13:01.813
[screams]

13:01.815 --> 13:03.782
What is all this junk?

13:03.784 --> 13:08.286
My legs!
My beautiful legs!

13:12.525 --> 13:15.326
Ow, ow. Ow, ow. Ow, ow.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.962
I burned my toe cleavage.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.398
And it's the only cleavage
I have.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.469
If it helps,
your toes do look bigger.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.870
Thank god I have
these flip-flops

13:25.872 --> 13:28.907
I used to wear in your shower
before I gave up.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.744
Yes, hi, I have
a complete emergency.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.679
My legs are burned.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.047
Okay, I hear you.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.715
I'll put you
right behind the guy

13:37.717 --> 13:40.418
Whose legs just came off.

13:42.221 --> 13:45.156
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.659
See, I just got burned
with pretty hot water,

13:47.661 --> 13:50.929
And I wear a lot
of peep-toe shoes.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.497
Insurance provider?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.933
I'd like to use my obamacare.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.136
Oh, obamacare?
Why didn't you say so?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.005
Come right in.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.808
What is the problem?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.410
We're all entitled
to obamacare.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.112
That's what that
rachel maddow guy said.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.915
I'll need more information
than that.

14:10.917 --> 14:14.085
Password: Malia?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.287
You clowns need
to figure out

14:16.289 --> 14:18.189
Your insurance information

14:18.191 --> 14:19.991
And come back to me
in about two hours

14:19.993 --> 14:21.426
When I'm on my sofa,

14:21.428 --> 14:24.629
Drinking whiskey
out of a coffee mug.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.264
Max, let's just sit.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.866
They have to take us,
by law.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.502
I know because I used
to complain about that.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.105
Max, can you take
that flu season pamphlet

14:34.107 --> 14:36.441
And fan my feet?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.543
No.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.878
I'm not touching
anything in here

14:39.880 --> 14:41.713
'cause I was
never vaccinated--

14:41.715 --> 14:44.682
Or loved.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.284
[phone ringing]

14:46.286 --> 14:48.953
Who is it?
It's deke.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.788
You're not gonna answer it?

14:50.790 --> 14:53.258
No, right now,
I am very concerned

14:53.260 --> 14:54.759
About your legs.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.962
Aw. You're lying.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.465
What happened
between you and deke?

15:00.467 --> 15:02.934
Why did you even
come home tonight?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.636
Was the sex bad?

15:04.638 --> 15:06.237
[sighs]

15:06.239 --> 15:09.007
Did you hit him?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.081
No, the sex was fine.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.783
Actually, it was
better than fine.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.252
It was great
and I wanted to stay.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.954
So?

15:22.956 --> 15:25.790
So I left immediately.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.626
Max, don't take this
the wrong way,

15:28.628 --> 15:30.295
But it sounds like
you found someone

15:30.297 --> 15:31.596
Who finally makes you happy

15:31.598 --> 15:33.431
And you're trying
to ruin it.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.667
Oh, that's what
this feeling is.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.769
Well, I got
to get rid of it.

15:37.771 --> 15:38.970
Why?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.439
I wasn't raised to be happy.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.974
I was raised
to believe canned meat

15:42.976 --> 15:46.044
Is as good as it gets.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.350
Ow, ow. Ow, ow.
Ow, ow.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.352
Earl, I spilled hot water
on my feet.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.055
You can't imagine
how much pain I'm in.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.257
Well, I kicked heroin

15:59.259 --> 16:02.527
In a 7/11 bathroom
for three days.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.596
But sorry about
your burnt tootsies though.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.200
Caroline,
sorry I didn't text you back.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.568
I would've come over
last night,

16:10.570 --> 16:13.071
But my <i>second life</i> wife
had a baby.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.340
I just can't believe
you had fake sex

16:15.342 --> 16:18.576
Nine months ago
and didn't tell anyone.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.747
Excuse me.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.016
I'm looking for a skinny blonde
that works here.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.358
Uh...She died.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.527
She right over there.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.029
Ooh, she came back to life!

16:38.031 --> 16:39.998
Hallelujah!

16:41.300 --> 16:44.135
Hey, I got something
for you.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.269
[gasps]
no!

16:45.271 --> 16:46.804
It's a mix tape.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.873
No!

16:51.477 --> 16:53.144
I made it for you.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.346
I'm sorry my brother
threw that cupcake at you.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.850
He's gluten-free
and upset about it.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.685
So can I take you out
sometime?

17:00.687 --> 17:05.957
Uh--uh, very sweet,
and you seem great,

17:05.959 --> 17:07.892
But I'm already
in a relationship

17:07.894 --> 17:10.962
With a guy
in a red bandana.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.137
No worries.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.472
Just thought I'd ask.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.411
What did you just do?

17:26.413 --> 17:29.247
You never say no to a guy
with tinted windows.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.649
That's rule number two.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.251
Well, his number's on here.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.852
I can always call him back.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.254
Then we can both
be in relationships

17:36.256 --> 17:37.422
We don't want to be in.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.257
Relationship?
Deke.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.059
You're gonna see him
at pastry school tomorrow.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.326
He's gonna want to know.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.095
Guys never want to know.

17:44.097 --> 17:47.231
In fact, they are dying
not to know.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.600
Max, why'd you leave
last night?

17:49.602 --> 17:51.369
I want to know.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.937
I mean, you were all like,

17:52.939 --> 17:55.807
"wham-bam,
thank you, man."

17:55.809 --> 17:57.508
And yeah, my brain was like,
"don't say it,

17:57.510 --> 17:58.976
Don't say it,
don't say it, don't say it,"

17:58.978 --> 18:00.745
But I said it.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.947
What's going on?

18:02.949 --> 18:06.584
Uh...The sex was bad.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.686
What about the scratches
on my back?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.022
I was trying to get away.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.424
I'll just
leave you two alone.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.992
Ow, ow. Ow, ow.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.528
I'll just be over here,
looking at my mix tape.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.598
Oh, track one,
"make it nasty."

18:22.134 --> 18:23.434
You're right, max.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.436
The sex was bad,
really bad.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.805
And it was worse when
we did it the second time.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.774
And that third time
was a disaster.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.009
I mean, I only
lasted 47 minutes

18:32.011 --> 18:34.112
And you screamed.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.647
Okay, walking away has to be

18:36.649 --> 18:38.015
Less painful
than hearing this.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.685
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
No, stay, caroline.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.786
We'll go outside.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.987
Max, come with me
for a second.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.622
I want to show you something.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.692
Just whip it out here.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.062
You wouldn't be the first guy
to do that tonight.

18:51.064 --> 18:54.165
Nor will he be the last.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.305
Okay, what do you
want to show me?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.941
Is that <i>your</i> dumpster?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.910
Look, you said
you couldn't stay over

19:05.912 --> 19:07.245
Because you lived
all the way

19:07.247 --> 19:09.280
Over by the diner,
so I moved it here

19:09.282 --> 19:12.950
To figure out what
your next excuse would be.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.789
Um, I'm racist.

19:21.059 --> 19:22.793
Yeah, me too.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.462
White girls are a hassle.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.430
What else?

19:26.432 --> 19:29.467
You have a bird
on your shirt.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.070
You love it.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.306
I do.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.509
What else?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.178
I got nothin'.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.279
Good.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.914
So what do you say

19:42.916 --> 19:44.615
You stop being
such a stupid face,

19:44.617 --> 19:46.117
And get your sweet dumper

19:46.119 --> 19:47.818
Into my dumpster right now,

19:47.820 --> 19:49.820
Where a brown chicken
and a brown cow

19:49.822 --> 19:52.723
Are waiting patiently
for you.

19:53.992 --> 19:55.193
Look.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.761
If you want me
in that dumpster,

19:56.763 --> 19:58.362
You'll have to get me there
the traditional way--

19:58.364 --> 20:00.531
Duct tape my wrists,
throw a bag over my head,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.900
And toss me in.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.538
Awful, huh?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.106
So bad.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.641
Want to do it again later,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.810
And then sleep over tonight,
and then do it again?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.212
Sure.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.314
Are we ever
gonna do it naked?

20:16.316 --> 20:17.715
Yeah, when you move
into a place

20:17.717 --> 20:20.551
Big enough for me
to take my pants off.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.119
Look, I got to warn you.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.854
I don't know how
to be happy.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.390
Then why do you have
that big smile on your face?

20:26.392 --> 20:28.125
I'm faking it.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.328
Why is it shaking?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.197
Are we still having sex?

20:37.002 --> 20:38.836
Thank you, sir.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.472
Enjoy your cupcake.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.844
Hey!

20:46.846 --> 20:48.246
Max?

20:48.248 --> 20:49.413
Don't tow us.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.215
This is deke's house.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.718
He lives in a dumpster?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.653
Yeah, but on purpose.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.822
But you're coming home
tonight, right?

20:57.824 --> 21:00.925
Max, max!

21:00.927 --> 21:02.827
Han?

21:02.829 --> 21:06.897
Han, what are you
doing tonight?
