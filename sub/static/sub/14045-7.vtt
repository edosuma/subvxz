00:02.527 --> 00:03.977
Your stalker got paroled last week.

00:03.977 --> 00:05.489
- What?
- Scott: I saw your face.

00:05.490 --> 00:07.431
You were terrified. You
don't have to put on a front.

00:07.432 --> 00:08.597
I'm not TC.

00:08.629 --> 00:10.074
Thank you for being here, Scott.

00:10.092 --> 00:11.752
Drew, I don't know who I am anymore.

00:11.753 --> 00:13.725
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

00:13.726 --> 00:14.812
Do what?

00:14.846 --> 00:16.797
I'm moving out.

00:16.848 --> 00:18.973
I'm not your boss anymore.

00:21.470 --> 00:22.748
Drew: There's a woman out here,

00:22.749 --> 00:25.065
tells me she's your sister-in-law, Annie.

00:25.066 --> 00:25.886
Hey, baby.

00:25.887 --> 00:28.949
Thad and I had a bet who
could talk to you first,

00:28.950 --> 00:30.520
and he beat me to it that day.

00:30.521 --> 00:32.327
What if <i>you'd</i> won the bet?

00:32.348 --> 00:33.400
I'll get the tab.

Annie?

00:59.646 --> 01:00.829
Annie?! Hey.

01:00.862 --> 01:01.896
Hey.

01:05.931 --> 01:07.236
Okay Annie, come on.

01:11.134 --> 01:13.053
Dispatcher: 911. What's your emergency?

01:13.086 --> 01:15.036
I need an ambulance at 742 Kenmar Drive.

01:15.070 --> 01:17.501
Female, 30, status post-fall
with blunt head trauma.

01:17.534 --> 01:18.393
Sir, could you please...

01:18.394 --> 01:21.259
No, I'm a doctor. I need
an ambulance here now, okay?

01:21.821 --> 01:23.836
Hang on, Annie. Hang on.

01:46.528 --> 01:47.739
Damn, dude.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.659
You get the license plate of
that truck that ran over you?

01:49.660 --> 01:51.410
I'm not having this conversation right now.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.892
Fine, but you better pound

01:52.893 --> 01:54.301
one of those rip it
energy things you drink,

01:54.302 --> 01:56.114
or you, my friend, ain't
making it through the shift.

01:56.138 --> 01:57.114
Ow.

01:57.115 --> 01:58.115
Ah, I'm s...

01:59.269 --> 02:00.228
What's his problem?

02:00.229 --> 02:01.554
Ah, I think he's letting his buddies

02:01.554 --> 02:03.885
Jim Beam and Jack Daniel's help
him deal with the Rick breakup.

02:03.909 --> 02:05.636
Ah. Poor guy.

02:05.637 --> 02:07.012
Hey, um, have you seen TC?

02:07.197 --> 02:09.801
Uh, don't think he's here
yet, but check with Topher.

02:09.803 --> 02:10.845
Okay, thanks.

02:11.295 --> 02:13.134
- Topher, um...
- Yep

02:13.135 --> 02:14.873
- have you seen Tee?
- I just got off the phone

02:14.874 --> 02:16.965
with the paramedics. Gwen says
they need a doctor out in the field.

02:16.989 --> 02:19.422
There's a boy with a bad neck
injury. He's stuck in a well.

02:19.441 --> 02:20.797
Tell 'em to send Lassie.

02:20.829 --> 02:22.525
- Really?
- Oh, you were serious.

02:22.557 --> 02:23.485
Yeah.

02:23.517 --> 02:26.077
Uh, Tee... TC's not in
yet. Can... can you go?

02:26.637 --> 02:30.365
Okay. Yeah, I'll go. Um,
just tell Gwen I'm on my way.

02:30.398 --> 02:31.083
Absolutely.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.714
Don't worry, honey, it'll be okay.

02:33.488 --> 02:35.404
Hey, sweetie, what are you doing here?

02:35.405 --> 02:36.574
She fell and hurt her wrist.

02:36.575 --> 02:37.778
What? Let me see that.

02:38.456 --> 02:41.405
- Ow! That hurts.
- Sorry, honey. What happened?

02:41.438 --> 02:43.272
She was at a concert tonight, and...

02:43.278 --> 02:44.957
- The Lil Wayne one?
- People just started pushing,

02:44.958 --> 02:46.655
and I fell and someone stepped on my hand.

02:46.656 --> 02:47.752
I thought we said that...

02:47.753 --> 02:49.625
Mom said I could go. It's fine, really.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.100
Stephanie's mom went with us.

02:51.134 --> 02:53.564
Stephanie's mom? The crazy one.

02:53.598 --> 02:55.083
She's not crazy, she's my friend,

02:55.084 --> 02:56.966
and can we take care of your
daughter's wrist, please?

02:56.990 --> 02:58.941
Yes, but I'm not done with this.

02:58.973 --> 03:00.444
Come on, come with me.

03:00.478 --> 03:02.716
Paul. Hey, this is my daughter, Naomi.

03:02.717 --> 03:05.213
Can we get her triaged and
an X-ray on her wrist, please?

03:05.245 --> 03:06.683
Sure thing. Come on.

03:07.307 --> 03:08.957
Drew, Topher, hey! I need you.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.441
Respiratory failure from head trauma.

03:10.442 --> 03:12.648
- Annie! What is she doing in town?
- I'll explain later, okay,

03:12.649 --> 03:14.280
we're going straight to CT.

03:14.596 --> 03:16.995
I saw her last night.
She looked like trouble.

03:17.988 --> 03:19.651
TC: Found her at the bottom of the stairs.

03:19.652 --> 03:21.085
We had a few drinks last night.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.116
She must've fallen.

03:22.117 --> 03:24.735
Why don't you step out? I'll take over the
case. You shouldn't be working on family.

03:24.736 --> 03:26.380
- I'm not leaving her.
- I think you should.

03:26.381 --> 03:28.540
I'm taking care of it, Topher. Gel.

03:33.918 --> 03:35.380
There. What's that?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.788
She's bleeding. Blood's pooling
at the bottom of her spleen.

03:37.822 --> 03:39.142
Okay, we got to get her to the OR.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.244
Come on.

03:43.518 --> 03:45.813
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

03:45.814 --> 03:47.580
I see Joey taught you well.

03:47.614 --> 03:48.573
He did.

03:48.605 --> 03:50.589
Still have a lot to learn from you.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.805
Sad to see him go.

03:51.837 --> 03:53.052
Yeah, that's what I hear.

03:54.887 --> 03:58.130
I'm just glad everybody up here's got
something else to gossip about besides me.

03:58.131 --> 03:58.685
TC: Hey!

03:58.718 --> 04:00.093
Which one of the ORs is free?

04:00.125 --> 04:00.893
Hey. What's going on?

04:00.894 --> 04:02.732
Bleeding in her abdomen.
A grade four splenic lac.

04:02.733 --> 04:04.039
All right, we'll take her in OR Two.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.086
I'm on it.

04:05.087 --> 04:06.694
For the hundredth time, TC,

04:06.695 --> 04:08.534
you're not staffed as a
surgeon at this hospital.

04:08.535 --> 04:10.341
Scott, Scott, it's his sister-in-law.

04:10.957 --> 04:11.957
Come on.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.426
[Sighs] Well, if you really care about her,

04:14.427 --> 04:15.653
you'll let a surgeon handle it.

04:15.677 --> 04:18.363
Let me take the lead. You're
more than welcome to assist.

04:18.398 --> 04:21.531
- It's the right call.
- Hey, hey.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.639
Any sign of trouble, you call me, okay?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.080
Of course.

04:25.081 --> 04:27.031
- Let's go.
- [Siren wails]

04:27.230 --> 04:29.106
Two patients. The mother
went down to rescue the boy.

04:29.107 --> 04:30.467
The boy's still down with a paramedic.

04:30.468 --> 04:33.222
Said we needed a doctor. We got the
mother out, but the boy can't be moved.

04:33.246 --> 04:34.475
Jordan: Hi, I'm Dr. Alexander.

04:34.476 --> 04:37.148
I'm fine. You have to get my
son Malcolm out of there, okay?

04:37.182 --> 04:38.204
Please just go!

04:38.238 --> 04:39.453
- Just go!
- Okay.

04:39.485 --> 04:41.726
Let's get a dressing on this.
I'm gonna check on the boy.

04:44.265 --> 04:45.013
Hey.

04:45.014 --> 04:46.182
Gwen: What took you so long?

04:46.183 --> 04:47.868
He has...

04:48.443 --> 04:49.340
Gwen?

04:49.373 --> 04:50.595
Gwen!

04:50.596 --> 04:53.123
- Okay, I need to get down there now.
- Yes, ma'am

Advertise your product or brand here

05:11.487 --> 05:13.925
All right. Ready? Go.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.721
All right, Gwen, hold on.

05:24.722 --> 05:25.987
I'm almost there.

05:31.361 --> 05:32.461
Come on.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.462
Come on.

05:33.561 --> 05:35.181
All right, deep breaths.

05:35.559 --> 05:37.734
Come on, take some deep
breaths. You're okay.

05:37.735 --> 05:39.206
Deep breaths.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.408
There you go.

05:40.409 --> 05:41.765
Okay, good. Good.

05:41.798 --> 05:43.466
You're going to be okay.

05:43.467 --> 05:44.489
Hi, Malcolm.

05:44.490 --> 05:45.528
I'm Dr. Alexander.

05:45.529 --> 05:47.051
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

05:47.591 --> 05:49.117
The hell were you thinking?

05:49.118 --> 05:51.846
There are pockets of methane
gas in wells like these.

05:51.878 --> 05:53.637
Thought I'd be out faster.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.782
He needed the mask more than I did.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.869
Where's yours?

05:56.902 --> 05:58.318
It's the last one. We have to alternate.

05:58.342 --> 06:00.166
[Muffled] Where's my mom? Is she okay?

06:00.198 --> 06:01.221
She's good.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.257
She's up there waiting for you, buddy.

06:03.302 --> 06:04.677
I didn't think he could be moved.

06:04.684 --> 06:05.844
It's a good thing you waited.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.513
I don't think his neck is fractured.

06:07.514 --> 06:09.228
It's probably a locked facet.

06:09.251 --> 06:11.205
He needs to see an orthopedist
when we get to the ER.

06:11.211 --> 06:13.166
To make sure there's no
permanent spinal cord damage.

06:13.190 --> 06:14.341
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.806
Okay.

06:17.703 --> 06:19.812
Hey, we're all set. Bring him up.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.045
Janine: Hang on, honey.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.613
We're gonna get you out of there.

06:25.989 --> 06:29.058
We're almost there. Hang on.

06:29.159 --> 06:31.353
We'll be right down for you, Doc.

06:31.419 --> 06:33.189
Thumb up for me. Ah, when did this happen?

06:33.223 --> 06:35.005
When Drake and Lil Wayne did "Love Me".

06:35.006 --> 06:36.785
I love that song. Wait, did they do, uh...

06:36.786 --> 06:39.397
Hey, Paul, can you just
please take care of the wrist.

06:39.431 --> 06:41.189
Yeah. All right.

06:41.222 --> 06:43.174
I can't believe you let her go, Lydia.

06:43.206 --> 06:44.261
We talked about this.

06:44.295 --> 06:45.606
We did <i>talk</i> about it,

06:45.638 --> 06:48.324
but all her friends were going
and I decided it was okay.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.550
And... and look... look what happened.

06:49.574 --> 06:51.277
Please, this could've happened anywhere.

06:51.719 --> 06:54.598
Look at how happy she
is. She had a great time.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.292
Maybe you two need to have this
conversation someplace else.

06:57.588 --> 07:00.186
Come on. Out.

07:04.039 --> 07:04.965
You're Mollie, right?

07:04.999 --> 07:05.561
Yeah.

07:05.562 --> 07:06.873
My dad told me you're a hard ass.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.697
- You got that right.
- [Laughs]

07:08.698 --> 07:10.392
[Chuckles] Yeah.

07:11.820 --> 07:13.509
Hey. Kenny.

07:13.518 --> 07:14.753
Hey, I just wanted to talk to you.

07:14.754 --> 07:16.263
I saw you kiss him.

07:18.433 --> 07:19.552
It's not what it looked like.

07:19.553 --> 07:20.984
What, you didn't have your
tongue down Joey's throat?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.701
'Cause that's... that's what it
that's what it looked like.

07:22.725 --> 07:23.501
Kenny...

07:23.502 --> 07:25.613
Look, I... I know we was
just doing the casual thing,

07:25.614 --> 07:28.494
and I don't know, maybe... maybe
I was making too much of it...

07:28.495 --> 07:31.569
- but regardless, you know me.
- Yeah.

07:31.570 --> 07:34.085
I'd never disrespect you like that.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.237
You know it.

07:38.887 --> 07:40.550
[Siren wailing]

07:42.060 --> 07:43.820
Hey Malcolm, your mom's
in the car behind us

07:43.852 --> 07:45.547
and she's gonna meet us at the hospital.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.028
Just want to check your eyes real quick.

07:47.052 --> 07:49.611
All right, buddy, you're doing great.

07:49.644 --> 07:50.644
There you go.

07:50.668 --> 07:53.420
- Local?
- Yeah, he's ready.

07:54.052 --> 07:55.386
And the morphine's in.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.556
That should keep him sedated.

07:56.588 --> 07:59.659
- OK
- So, Mommy, you haven't told TC yet, huh?

07:59.692 --> 08:03.115
No, I haven't told TC. I mean,
[Sighs] I just took the test.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.035
But when I get back to the hospital

08:05.068 --> 08:07.339
I'm going to find a quiet
moment to talk to him...

08:07.372 --> 08:09.388
I mean, not exactly
something you just blurt out.

08:09.420 --> 08:10.475
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

08:11.581 --> 08:13.187
Is this a good thing?

08:13.188 --> 08:15.495
Gwen, I am freaking out.

08:15.496 --> 08:18.474
I mean, I always knew that
I was gonna be a mother.

08:18.475 --> 08:21.483
I just didn't picture
it happening like this.

08:21.996 --> 08:24.491
You know? We didn't exactly plan it.

08:24.524 --> 08:26.187
But I'm also happy.

08:26.220 --> 08:30.102
TC and I, we're not perfect,
but we love each other.

08:31.852 --> 08:34.091
So...

08:34.124 --> 08:36.075
All right, let's do this, then.

08:37.253 --> 08:41.523
[Monitor beeping]

08:41.524 --> 08:46.579
[Monitor beeping]

08:50.360 --> 08:51.978
Hey.

08:53.111 --> 08:53.906
Hi.

08:53.956 --> 08:55.107
No, don't.

08:55.108 --> 08:57.859
You're... you were intubated,
so your throat is sore.

08:58.156 --> 08:59.819
And you were in surgery.

08:59.852 --> 09:00.852
[Groans]

09:00.877 --> 09:03.299
Fell down the stairs, hurt your spleen.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.155
Gave me quite a scare.

09:05.252 --> 09:07.418
You're gonna be okay.
Just go back to sleep.

09:07.419 --> 09:08.730
I'll be right by your side.

09:09.642 --> 09:10.859
Just because we're divorced

09:10.892 --> 09:13.259
doesn't mean you can undermine me, okay?

09:13.292 --> 09:15.060
We're still supposed to
make decisions together.

09:15.084 --> 09:17.244
Yeah, like when you made the
decision to quit your job.

09:17.281 --> 09:18.240
That's different.

09:18.241 --> 09:19.441
Yeah, that was way worse.

09:19.442 --> 09:22.247
Cost our family 150 grand a year,

09:22.248 --> 09:24.299
and now I have to carry
a significant burden.

09:24.332 --> 09:26.955
What was I supposed to do? Be miserable?

09:26.988 --> 09:28.422
[Scoffs] You were miserable for years.

09:28.423 --> 09:29.711
That's because I was so unhappy.

09:29.712 --> 09:31.839
When you have two kids,
you make sacrifices.

09:31.852 --> 09:34.261
Speaking of, did you pay the
hotel for Naomi's quinceañera?

09:34.285 --> 09:37.087
Yes. I already told you
that, so please stop asking.

09:37.088 --> 09:38.178
Ah, ex... excuse me.

09:38.179 --> 09:40.187
Um, the X-ray shows no fractures.

09:40.270 --> 09:41.331
Just a sprain.

09:41.332 --> 09:42.387
Oh, thank God.

09:42.388 --> 09:44.051
- D... do you want to step in?
- Yeah.

09:46.014 --> 09:47.147
Thank you.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.537
- You're welcome.
- Good to go.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.419
Can I stay? Hang out with Dad.

09:51.020 --> 09:53.889
Yeah y... you you sure, honey? Huh?

09:53.890 --> 09:55.424
It's not gonna be that much fun.

09:55.425 --> 09:56.719
I'm gonna be pretty busy, too.

09:56.719 --> 09:57.851
All right?

09:57.852 --> 09:59.890
I think it's a great idea.

10:00.108 --> 10:02.763
She should stay and see
what her father really does.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.667
Yeah, come on Dad,
please? I'm not even tired.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.786
Yes. Yes, of course.

10:08.787 --> 10:11.051
- Woman: Incoming!
- [Siren wailing]

10:11.052 --> 10:12.513
Cool, a patient.

10:12.514 --> 10:14.156
- Can I watch you work?
- Ragosa: Uh, no.

10:14.186 --> 10:15.567
No, that's... that's not my patient.

10:15.567 --> 10:16.651
Maybe later, okay, honey?

10:16.684 --> 10:18.726
Come on. Let's go to the
break room and go hang out.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.207
Drop her off in the morning and
make sure she eats something.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.488
I've been feeding her for 14
years. I think we'll be okay.

10:25.810 --> 10:28.159
Got a bilateral locked facet
from a deep fall in a well.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.940
- Never seen one of these before.
- Well, here's your chance.

10:29.951 --> 10:31.054
- Ah.
- Are you okay?

10:31.055 --> 10:32.805
Yeah, I just tweaked my
ankle going down the well.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.878
I'll be fine. I'll just put some ice on it.

10:33.879 --> 10:36.859
Do not listen to her. She passed out from
methane. She needs fluids and a blood-gas.

10:36.860 --> 10:39.198
- And Jordan needs the same test.
- Yes, and I will get it.

10:39.199 --> 10:41.547
Um, hey, Drew, can you take
care of Mrs. Coury, please?

10:41.580 --> 10:43.019
I am not leaving my son's side.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.320
Okay.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.772
Okay, but you have to let us do our work.

10:45.773 --> 10:46.205
Okay.

10:46.206 --> 10:47.839
Uh, Drew, can you page ortho, please?

10:47.840 --> 10:50.262
No ortho tonight. Already
called them on another case.

10:50.528 --> 10:52.827
Okay, on three. One, two, three.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.446
Are you worried about cervical subluxation?

10:54.447 --> 10:56.957
- W... what does that mean?
- It means we're gonna have to reduce his spine ourselves.

10:56.958 --> 11:00.139
Paul, Drew, get me the Gardner-Wells
tongs and some five-pound weights.

11:00.171 --> 11:01.978
We're gonna have to snap
his neck back into place.

11:02.002 --> 11:03.195
Are you gonna knock me out?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.595
Sorry, buddy, but we're
gonna need you awake for this.

11:05.772 --> 11:08.627
Don't worry. We're gonna numb you
so you won't feel a thing, okay?

11:08.628 --> 11:09.451
Oh, my God.

11:09.484 --> 11:11.339
- Where's my mom?
- Your mom's right outside.

11:11.372 --> 11:14.827
Malcolm, we're not gonna let
anything bad happen to you, okay?

11:14.860 --> 11:17.035
It's gonna be all right, I promise.

11:17.068 --> 11:19.789
All right, ready, Drew? Good

11:21.132 --> 11:23.275
[Groans]

11:28.543 --> 11:29.790
- Hey, Toph.
- Hey.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.650
Uh, my daughter is here
tonight. I hope that's okay.

11:33.070 --> 11:34.509
- Yeah, of course.
- Good.

11:34.942 --> 11:37.100
See, the thing is, uh,
[Clears throat] you know,

11:37.101 --> 11:38.844
with the whole job change and all,

11:39.238 --> 11:41.029
I may have insinuated that I do a bit more

11:41.030 --> 11:42.374
than a physician's assistant.

11:42.508 --> 11:43.692
How much more?

11:43.693 --> 11:45.297
Naomi: Dad, I'm bored.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.317
When am I gonna see all the
cool life-saving stuff you do?

11:48.350 --> 11:50.843
S... so, anyway, Michael,
um, about your patient.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.756
Radiology called. The
CT shows a small pneumo.

11:53.757 --> 11:55.708
You think a Heimlich valve would do?

11:55.775 --> 11:56.775
Yes.

11:56.776 --> 11:59.281
Yes, yes. If it's, uh,
small and non-traumatic,

11:59.306 --> 12:00.567
- that should work.
- Right.

12:00.592 --> 12:02.178
Uh, Naomi, stay out of people's hair.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.750
- I'm gonna go check on my patient, okay?
- Mm-hm.

12:03.774 --> 12:05.447
Thanks, Michael.

12:06.590 --> 12:08.646
Okay, seriously, what's the grossest thing

12:08.647 --> 12:10.630
you've pulled out of somebody's butt?

12:13.137 --> 12:14.224
Drew: We're in the bone.

12:14.225 --> 12:16.170
Jordan: Okay, Malcolm, we're all set here.

12:16.212 --> 12:17.806
You're gonna feel a little
pressure when we add the weights,

12:17.807 --> 12:19.312
but we're gonna take things slow, okay?

12:19.336 --> 12:20.487
- Right start with 10?
- Yeah.

12:20.488 --> 12:21.488
Okay.

12:23.198 --> 12:24.708
- Malcolm: Dr. Alexander?
- Yeah?

12:24.709 --> 12:26.097
I can't feel my legs.

12:26.301 --> 12:28.092
Okay, can you move your toes for me?

12:28.700 --> 12:31.294
- I can't.
- Lost his reflexes.

12:31.295 --> 12:33.533
All right, so much for
slow. Drew, help me pull.

12:34.590 --> 12:38.206
Okay, on three. One, two, three.

12:38.238 --> 12:40.509
- [Neck cracks]
- [Screams]

12:40.543 --> 12:41.791
You all right, Malcolm?

12:41.792 --> 12:42.816
Uh, yeah.

12:43.134 --> 12:45.074
Yeah, it actually feels a lot better.

12:45.791 --> 12:47.454
I can move my neck.

12:47.454 --> 12:48.477
And the numbness?

12:48.510 --> 12:50.750
Uh, it's still there, but not as bad.

12:52.493 --> 12:53.781
Are we too late?

12:53.782 --> 12:54.869
I don't know.

12:55.230 --> 12:57.089
If he's lucky, his spinal
cord is just contused

12:57.090 --> 12:58.886
and he'll regain function
when the swelling goes down,

12:58.910 --> 13:00.519
but for now we're just gonna have to wait.

13:00.543 --> 13:02.644
Why don't you guys get started on the halo?

13:02.645 --> 13:03.891
And I'm gonna go get changed.

13:04.657 --> 13:06.302
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

13:06.334 --> 13:08.455
- Wh... what is it? Ah, okay.
- [Wheezing]

13:08.456 --> 13:09.978
Annie. Scott!

13:09.979 --> 13:11.581
I need a crash cart she's not breathing!

13:11.615 --> 13:14.042
- Is she bleeding again?
- She was talking, she was fine.

13:14.929 --> 13:16.343
I got to re-intubate her. A bag...

13:16.344 --> 13:18.269
- Is that Annie?
- Yeah.

13:18.302 --> 13:19.325
What happened?

13:19.358 --> 13:21.310
She fell down the stairs this morning.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.858
She was at your house?

13:22.859 --> 13:25.879
Let's not do this now. Scott,
hand me the laryngoscope.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.037
Did you run a tox screen?

13:27.071 --> 13:27.882
No.

13:27.883 --> 13:29.051
Give me a shot of naloxone.

13:29.052 --> 13:30.693
Jordan, we just had
drinks last night, okay?

13:30.694 --> 13:31.636
She's not on anything.

13:31.637 --> 13:33.317
She fell down the stairs, hurt her spleen.

13:33.374 --> 13:34.525
You wanna make a bet?

13:40.156 --> 13:41.534
Anesthesia cross reacted

13:41.535 --> 13:43.581
with whatever narcotics
she had in her system.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.758
Damn it, if I'd have known that...

13:44.759 --> 13:46.774
I swear we just had drinks last night.

13:47.038 --> 13:48.829
Hey. You okay?

13:48.862 --> 13:49.917
What's happening?

13:49.950 --> 13:52.503
What's Jordan doing here?

13:52.504 --> 13:53.998
What am <i>I doing here?</i>

13:54.366 --> 13:55.965
I just saved your life.

13:55.998 --> 13:58.173
- [Coughing]
- Excuse me.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.469
You're cute.

14:01.917 --> 14:03.550
- What's your name?
- Dr. Clemmens.

14:03.582 --> 14:06.557
You should... you should sit
back, try and relax, okay?

14:06.591 --> 14:08.797
Give you some privacy.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.205
Thanks.

14:10.238 --> 14:12.061
[Jordan coughing]

14:12.095 --> 14:15.230
[Toilet flushes]

14:16.053 --> 14:17.054
Excuse me.

14:17.055 --> 14:18.379
Sorry.

14:22.289 --> 14:25.373
Just came in here 'cause I
didn't want him to see me crying.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.429
[Sighs]

14:26.462 --> 14:28.670
I was trying to be brave for him, you know?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.686
Yeah. You two seem very close.

14:30.718 --> 14:33.981
Yeah, we are. It's just me and him.

14:34.014 --> 14:35.005
[Sighs]

14:35.038 --> 14:38.141
We were camping for the first time.

14:38.174 --> 14:40.442
I don't know what I was thinking.

14:41.182 --> 14:43.933
[Sighs] Is he gonna be okay?

14:43.966 --> 14:46.333
We're gonna take a look
at him in another hour.

14:46.366 --> 14:47.966
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:48.417 --> 14:49.888
You have kids?

14:52.222 --> 14:55.165
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.862
[Chuckles]

14:56.894 --> 15:00.446
The retching and the hesitation right now.

15:00.478 --> 15:02.045
It's the greatest.

15:02.078 --> 15:05.309
Not the pregnant part. That
sucks. But being a mom...

15:06.958 --> 15:09.948
Your heart really does triple
in size like the Grinch.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.841
And it starts sooner than you think.

15:11.842 --> 15:15.229
Those little buggers... they
weasel their way right up here.

15:18.296 --> 15:19.662
You have to stop calling me.

15:19.663 --> 15:21.784
It was one time, and you know what?

15:21.938 --> 15:24.394
I don't even remember
his name, so let it go.

15:24.574 --> 15:25.743
[Cellphone beeps]

15:25.744 --> 15:28.098
So, Kenny's upset with me
now, which really sucks.

15:28.111 --> 15:30.599
Bu... but I'm sure he's already
told you about what happened, right?

15:30.620 --> 15:33.326
About you shoving your tongue
down Joey's throat in front of him?

15:33.327 --> 15:36.061
- No, he failed to mention it.
- Uh, sorry, that... that's not fair.

15:36.062 --> 15:38.438
- That's not actually how it happened.
- And yet it happened.

15:38.462 --> 15:39.590
Why are you being such a jerk?

15:39.614 --> 15:42.118
I just... I just want to talk to
you like you talk to me about Rick.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.701
I'm done talking about Rick. He left me.

15:44.734 --> 15:47.390
- I've moved on.
- Moved on to what?

15:47.422 --> 15:49.662
You look like hell.

15:49.694 --> 15:51.773
Look, I'm sorry about you and Kenny.

15:51.806 --> 15:53.341
I'm sorry that Joey left.

15:53.374 --> 15:54.429
I've got work to do.

15:54.463 --> 15:55.805
I'm sure you do, too.

16:01.791 --> 16:02.717
Hey.

16:02.751 --> 16:04.509
- Hey.
- You okay?

16:04.542 --> 16:07.399
Yeah, my, uh, stomach's a little queasy.

16:07.435 --> 16:10.276
- It's just, uh, bad sushi. I think.
- Oh.

16:10.331 --> 16:12.029
Hey, did you know that Annie was in town?

16:12.307 --> 16:14.930
First of all, you need some
gum... at least two pieces.

16:15.340 --> 16:16.445
And second of all,

16:16.478 --> 16:18.536
I didn't know about Annie
till Tee brought her in.

16:18.537 --> 16:19.934
- He didn't tell <i>you?</i>
<i>- Mnh-mnh.</i>

16:19.935 --> 16:21.350
Well, he knows you two don't get along.

16:21.374 --> 16:23.536
That's because she's a
terrible influence on him.

16:23.537 --> 16:25.981
No argument here. I mean,
we've seen it before.

16:25.982 --> 16:28.189
It happens every time, but
she is his brother's widow,

16:28.222 --> 16:30.749
so just saying, the more you push...

16:30.782 --> 16:31.782
Exactly.

16:31.966 --> 16:33.885
See, this is why I need
to get you on my team.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.613
Okay? She knows how to manipulate him.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.693
Look, I'm not trying to be a bitch here.

16:37.726 --> 16:38.787
- It's just...
- I know.

16:38.788 --> 16:40.699
I... it's just he's a pit
bull when it comes to family,

16:40.700 --> 16:44.157
so let's just try to lead
him in the right direction.

16:44.190 --> 16:46.493
Okay. You're right.

16:47.601 --> 16:49.341
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

16:49.374 --> 16:50.537
Good idea.

16:50.538 --> 16:52.425
I'm sorry. I'm just...

16:55.678 --> 16:58.717
It's been really rough since Thad died.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.997
Been four years,

17:00.030 --> 17:02.653
and I know I'm supposed to
get over it by now, but...

17:05.054 --> 17:07.133
if only it was that easy.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.025
So, I thought if I came to see you...

17:10.037 --> 17:11.488
You could always come and see me.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.540
Yeah, I know.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.909
But last night, we started
reminiscing about him, and...

17:17.431 --> 17:20.448
I just started feeling
things I didn't want to feel.

17:20.449 --> 17:22.079
So I took something.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.861
It was a one-time thing.

17:24.894 --> 17:26.621
I just had some old pills in my purse.

17:26.654 --> 17:30.173
Annie, if I hadn't found you when I did...

17:30.865 --> 17:31.805
You can't do that.

17:31.838 --> 17:33.059
Do you understand?

17:33.059 --> 17:35.306
I won't. I swear.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.337
I... I threw the rest of
'em out after I took 'em.

17:38.345 --> 17:39.345
Okay.

17:41.952 --> 17:43.133
I'm really tired.

17:43.985 --> 17:45.469
Can we talk later?

17:45.502 --> 17:46.502
Yeah.

17:48.677 --> 17:50.717
I'll check in with you later, okay?

18:00.042 --> 18:01.831
- You crazy?
- You can't take a tight end

18:01.832 --> 18:03.407
in the first round of a fantasy draft.

18:03.408 --> 18:05.290
[Scoffs] You do when it's Jimmy Graham.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.251
Over Brees?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.030
Crazy.

18:07.031 --> 18:08.115
Correct me if I'm wrong here,

18:08.116 --> 18:10.273
but I think only one of us
actually played football.

18:10.274 --> 18:12.071
Players make the worst coaches.

18:12.072 --> 18:14.525
- Hear that. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, so you're a coach now, too, huh?

18:14.558 --> 18:17.154
I got you. I got you.

18:17.155 --> 18:18.397
It feels good.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.285
Want to do this one, too?

18:20.318 --> 18:22.717
[Chuckles] Aren't you the bossy one?

18:23.967 --> 18:26.269
- 'Sup, Jordan?
- Hey

18:26.302 --> 18:27.613
Thank you.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.465
What was that all about?

18:31.466 --> 18:32.969
You seen that man's biceps?

18:32.970 --> 18:34.528
- Oh, really?
- That's all it takes for you?

18:34.538 --> 18:36.582
- Well, I'm sure his abs are amazing, too.
- Ah-ha...

18:36.593 --> 18:40.093
I don't know, I've just been watching him
this past month, and he's just so nice.

18:40.126 --> 18:42.109
Guys who look like that are usually dicks.

18:42.142 --> 18:45.549
Yeah, he's a real sweetheart, but,
uh, I think he's seeing Krista.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.046
Oh, please. I heard she
made out with Chavez.

18:47.070 --> 18:48.157
It's open season, girl.

18:48.190 --> 18:48.968
Okay.

18:48.968 --> 18:50.766
Hey, did you get your
blood-gas and isotopes back yet?

18:50.767 --> 18:51.757
- I did.
- Uh-huh?

18:51.758 --> 18:53.733
And me and my little friend are a-okay.

18:53.734 --> 18:54.789
Okay.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.773
And did you tell TC about little TC?

18:56.774 --> 18:57.701
Not yet.

18:57.702 --> 18:58.982
You know, I want to tell him,

18:58.983 --> 19:02.070
but now is not exactly the best
time considering that Annie is here.

19:02.302 --> 19:03.484
Oh, wow.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.565
Oh, yeah. I just gave her a shot of Narcan.

19:05.598 --> 19:06.869
She should keep that stuff in her purse.

19:06.870 --> 19:07.797
Tell me about it.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.011
Did you ever end up telling
TC about all the stuff she did?

19:10.035 --> 19:11.058
No.

19:11.390 --> 19:13.358
I mean, when TC came back from the war,

19:13.359 --> 19:14.909
she was the least of his problems.

19:14.942 --> 19:16.477
It's true.

19:16.510 --> 19:18.060
- Jordan!
- Malcolm's pressure's dropping.

19:18.084 --> 19:19.486
Okay. Got to run, honey.

19:19.487 --> 19:21.410
- All right, see you later.
- Yeah. Talk to you later.

19:21.434 --> 19:22.284
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

19:22.285 --> 19:24.551
Blood pressure and heart rate
are both dropping. I don't get it.

19:24.569 --> 19:27.069
That means he's going into neurogenic
shock from the spinal injury.

19:27.070 --> 19:28.285
What... what does that mean?

19:28.318 --> 19:30.310
It means his spinal cord is
more injured than we thought.

19:30.334 --> 19:31.139
So now what?

19:31.140 --> 19:33.314
Janine, we are going to
do everything that we can

19:33.314 --> 19:34.794
- for Malcolm, okay?
- Okay.

19:34.795 --> 19:37.126
All right, let's place a central
line and start a dopamine drip.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.133
- Come with me.
- Okay.

19:42.341 --> 19:43.620
Here you go, Jocelyn.

19:43.653 --> 19:45.553
Just make sure you check his
vitals every two hours, okay?

19:45.554 --> 19:46.436
[Grunts]

19:46.470 --> 19:48.279
Hey, stay away from him, you hear me?!

19:48.292 --> 19:49.909
What the hell are you
doing?! Get over here!

19:49.910 --> 19:51.161
- What are you doing?
- Let him go.

19:51.162 --> 19:52.525
What? You sure you don't
want to take him out back

19:52.549 --> 19:53.848
- and kick his ass?
- Anytime, pal.

19:53.849 --> 19:54.925
Huh? Oh, I wish you would.

19:54.926 --> 19:56.107
- Let him go!
- Anytime!

19:56.353 --> 19:57.701
What? Huh?

19:58.045 --> 20:00.644
- Let me take a look at that.
- I got it. Just leave me alone.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.346
You take a break!

20:04.099 --> 20:06.827
Till you get your head straight.

20:07.012 --> 20:08.928
So, you didn't want to
tell me that Annie was here

20:08.952 --> 20:11.232
because you didn't want
to hear me bitch about her.

20:11.239 --> 20:12.856
- Am I right?
- Yeah, pretty much.

20:13.636 --> 20:16.536
You guys got some Alpha
female drama going on,

20:16.537 --> 20:18.107
so I figured that she could come and go,

20:18.126 --> 20:19.395
and then I'd tell you.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.219
She <i>didn't</i> come and go, did she?

20:21.252 --> 20:22.659
[Sighs]

20:22.693 --> 20:25.049
Look, Tee, you need to
put down some boundaries,

20:25.050 --> 20:26.185
otherwise she's just gonna
take advantage of you.

20:26.186 --> 20:28.127
Look, Jordan, she's family.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.793
I'm not just gonna push
her away, all right?

20:29.794 --> 20:31.105
That's not what I said.

20:31.106 --> 20:34.659
We were reminiscing last night.
It was nice. She got carried away.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.649
It's not gonna happen again.

20:35.650 --> 20:37.537
I don't even want to
fight with you about this.

20:38.084 --> 20:40.403
There's so many other things that
I would rather talk to you about.

20:40.404 --> 20:41.651
Like what?

20:41.652 --> 20:44.179
Dr. Alexander, we need you in Trauma One.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.531
[Sighs]

20:47.382 --> 20:49.785
- [Janine grunts]
- Ma... Malcolm's fine. It's his mom.

20:49.786 --> 20:51.224
Help my mom, please.

20:51.225 --> 20:54.839
It's burning and it hurts.
Can you just get this off me?

20:54.840 --> 20:55.860
Okay, okay.

20:55.861 --> 20:57.172
[Panting]

20:57.636 --> 20:58.883
Okay.

20:59.877 --> 21:01.785
Paul: Ooh! That looks bad.

21:01.801 --> 21:02.736
[Groans]

21:02.737 --> 21:04.434
Okay, let's get her into Trauma Two now.

21:08.762 --> 21:10.307
Malcolm: What's going on?

21:10.308 --> 21:11.866
- Mom!
- Jordan: I need you to stay calm, Malcolm.

21:11.878 --> 21:13.593
Don't move or you'll hurt yourself.

21:15.193 --> 21:18.234
Okay, give her a dose of Zosyn and send
this off for a wound culture, please.

21:19.126 --> 21:20.738
TC: Necrotic tissue here... it's infected.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.739
- It needs to be debrided.
- All right, I'll do it.

21:22.777 --> 21:24.305
All right. You guys okay with this?

21:24.306 --> 21:26.227
- Yeah, thank you.
- All right, we'll talk later.

21:28.214 --> 21:29.240
Gwen: Hey.

21:29.274 --> 21:31.323
- I heard Annie's in town.
- [Sighs]

21:31.324 --> 21:34.101
Am I gonna have to hear this from you,
too? You and Jordan don't like her.

21:34.102 --> 21:36.536
I get it. I'm... I'm tired
of all this girl drama.

21:36.537 --> 21:37.593
Girl drama?

21:37.594 --> 21:41.208
This isn't girl drama, you jerk.
Jordan has legitimate reasons.

21:41.209 --> 21:42.400
Well, I've never heard any.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.537
Yeah, because she never
wanted to burden you.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.008
But I don't have that problem.

21:46.042 --> 21:46.960
What are you talking about?

21:46.961 --> 21:48.951
I'm talking about how you have no idea

21:48.951 --> 21:51.126
about all of Annie's crap
that Jordan had to put up with

21:51.127 --> 21:52.157
while you were gone.

21:52.158 --> 21:55.049
Annie was, and from the
sounds of it, still is a mess.

21:55.050 --> 21:56.506
She is an addict, TC.

21:56.507 --> 21:57.901
No. That's not true.

21:57.902 --> 22:00.120
Annie stole money from
Jordan, she wrecked her car,

22:00.120 --> 22:01.432
all kinds of lying.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.640
But Jordan helped her
because she loves you.

22:03.674 --> 22:06.553
Jordan even got her into
rehab, but it never stuck.

22:06.585 --> 22:08.569
So, why didn't she ever tell me?

22:08.601 --> 22:10.585
She was trying to protect you.

22:10.617 --> 22:12.536
You had enough on your plate.

22:12.570 --> 22:15.257
But now is the time for
you to deal with this

22:15.290 --> 22:18.040
and take the stress off
of Jordan, especially now.

22:18.074 --> 22:19.737
Especially now?

22:21.241 --> 22:24.731
Just because this is your
chance to be together.

22:24.732 --> 22:28.034
You know? Don't screw it up.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.203
- There you are. I was just about to...
- Son of a bitch!

22:42.204 --> 22:43.193
Is that pee?

22:43.194 --> 22:44.182
Uh, yeah,

22:44.183 --> 22:46.664
- it's, uh...
- Gross.

22:47.322 --> 22:48.904
So, what are you doing with pee?

22:48.905 --> 22:50.313
You know what, honey?

22:50.554 --> 22:52.760
There's something I need to tell you,

22:52.794 --> 22:55.001
and there's probably not a better time

22:55.033 --> 22:57.752
than when I'm soaked in
a homeless man's urine.

22:59.098 --> 23:01.465
I need to tell you about my job.

23:01.497 --> 23:04.313
- What do you mean, Dad? [Chuckling]
- I'm technically not even a PA.

23:04.314 --> 23:06.051
I exaggerated what I do.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.200
Yes, I... I have helped save a man's life.

23:10.233 --> 23:12.601
I... I do work on patients,
but for the most part,

23:12.633 --> 23:16.281
I do paperwork, draw blood,
and sort urine samples.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.905
So, you quit your job to do <i>this?</i>

23:18.937 --> 23:21.081
I quit... I quit to become a doctor.

23:21.113 --> 23:23.736
But after the test, you'll
<i>be</i> a doctor, right?

23:23.770 --> 23:25.036
Well...

23:25.561 --> 23:26.917
Sort of.

23:27.293 --> 23:32.089
I'll have my degree, but, uh, I'll
still have an internship residency.

23:32.670 --> 23:35.641
It'll be about four years
before I become an actual doctor.

23:35.673 --> 23:39.136
Four years? So, until
then, you just clean up pee?

23:39.137 --> 23:42.013
Well, that'll be all done
after the test, but listen.

23:42.014 --> 23:48.127
I have to tell you, I have been
humbled by this job, even humiliated.

23:48.128 --> 23:49.951
But I wouldn't trade it for one second.

23:50.785 --> 23:54.195
Besides you and your brother, this is the
best thing that has ever happened to me,

23:54.196 --> 23:59.448
and I hope you learn from me that you
should always, always follow your dreams.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.702
Maybe you should've chosen a smaller dream.

24:03.907 --> 24:05.309
Yeah.

24:06.137 --> 24:08.408
[Monitor beeping]

24:12.001 --> 24:15.633
Hey. Just came to change her
dressing, but she's still asleep.

24:15.693 --> 24:16.488
Thanks.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.489
Yeah.

24:17.696 --> 24:18.696
[Sighs]

24:20.614 --> 24:23.676
Jordan was really freaked out
last night about this stalker guy.

24:23.677 --> 24:24.905
Is there any news on him yet?

24:24.906 --> 24:26.314
What are... what are you talking about?

24:26.338 --> 24:28.241
I'm sorry, man. I... I
assumed she had told you.

24:28.435 --> 24:31.763
That stalker guy from... from
a few years ago, he's out.

24:32.141 --> 24:33.105
He slashed her tires.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.177
[Monitor beeping rapidly]

24:35.332 --> 24:36.625
She's getting tachy again.

24:36.658 --> 24:38.084
Hey.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.721
- She looks jaundiced.
- Annie, can you hear me?

24:41.690 --> 24:43.089
Yeah, she's definitely jaundiced.

24:43.122 --> 24:44.241
Her liver's shutting down.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.521
Annie, what else did you take?

24:45.554 --> 24:46.746
Nothing.

24:46.747 --> 24:48.506
Did you take any other
pills, any other pain killers?

24:48.530 --> 24:49.882
Hey, look at me. What
else? We need to know.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.032
What did you take? It could kill you.

24:51.033 --> 24:53.382
Vicodin. I've been taking
Vicodin the past few days.

24:53.383 --> 24:56.026
Vicodin's got Tylenol in it, okay?
Too much of that will kill your liver.

24:56.050 --> 24:58.641
Give her 150 milligrams per
kilogram of N-acetylcysteine.

24:58.674 --> 25:00.849
- Let's hope we're not too late.
- Damn it, Annie.

25:00.882 --> 25:02.053
You lied to me.

25:02.054 --> 25:07.098
[Beeping continues]

25:07.194 --> 25:08.249
Topher: Drew.

25:08.281 --> 25:10.040
Drew! Hey, slow down.

25:10.074 --> 25:13.219
I just got chewed out by HR over
your little incident earlier.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.695
Between that and going all Jon
Jones on that guy last night,

25:15.696 --> 25:17.359
you're really racking
up some negative points.

25:17.381 --> 25:19.094
That guy was messing with Gwen, all right?

25:19.095 --> 25:20.251
I... I don't want to
hear any more about it.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.091
I defended you, so get it together.

25:22.092 --> 25:24.524
And for the rest of the shift,
you're on cold and flu only.

25:27.388 --> 25:29.020
Hey, Mollie, uh, are the results back

25:29.052 --> 25:30.268
from Mrs. Coury's wound culture?

25:30.269 --> 25:30.855
Not yet.

25:30.927 --> 25:32.288
All right, just let me
know when they get in,

25:32.289 --> 25:32.882
- okay?
- Yep.

25:32.883 --> 25:34.343
Hey, Jordan. You got a second?

25:34.344 --> 25:35.462
Yeah.

25:37.084 --> 25:38.139
What's up?

25:38.172 --> 25:41.531
Uh, just wanted to give you a heads up.

25:41.564 --> 25:44.059
I didn't realize that you
hadn't told TC about the stalker.

25:44.092 --> 25:45.499
So, you told him?

25:45.532 --> 25:48.091
Well, I didn't know that
you hadn't. It just came up.

25:48.124 --> 25:50.483
W... I haven't exactly had the time.

25:50.484 --> 25:51.579
Uh, did he say anything?

25:51.612 --> 25:54.171
He didn't seem happy about it.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.805
Anyway, I'm sorry. I really didn't know.

25:55.836 --> 25:57.243
It's okay.

25:57.276 --> 25:58.545
Jordan! We need you.

26:01.180 --> 26:03.515
It's already spreading,
and her pressure's dropping.

26:03.548 --> 26:07.057
[Monitor beeping]

26:13.579 --> 26:15.755
Her subcutaneous tissue isn't oxygenating.

26:15.756 --> 26:16.859
It's why she's getting septic.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.076
Gas underneath the skin, blistering.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.539
This is necrotizing fasciitis.

26:20.572 --> 26:22.622
Flesh-eating bacteria. She
needs to get up to surgery.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.078
Let's wrap this leg and get her moving.

26:24.079 --> 26:25.079
Now.

26:30.884 --> 26:33.187
Let's get her prepped in
OR Two and get scrubbed in.

26:33.220 --> 26:34.243
- You got this?
- Yep.

26:34.275 --> 26:36.651
- I'll keep you updated.
- Thank you.

26:37.155 --> 26:38.851
- [Door closes]
- Jordan.

26:39.812 --> 26:41.507
Did the infection spread?

26:41.540 --> 26:42.531
Yeah.

26:42.564 --> 26:44.291
Nec-fasc, and I hope we got it in time.

26:46.825 --> 26:49.795
Listen, Tee, about this
whole stalker thing...

26:49.828 --> 26:52.739
Yeah, I know, Scott told me all
about it. It was a lot of fun.

26:52.772 --> 26:57.763
I'm sorry. Look, they caught the guy, okay?

26:57.796 --> 26:59.751
And I called you last
night to tell you about him,

26:59.752 --> 27:01.646
but you didn't answer your phone.

27:01.796 --> 27:04.163
Scott ended up taking me home.

27:04.196 --> 27:05.379
Scott took you home.

27:06.162 --> 27:08.748
- This just gets better and better.
- Uh. He was doing me a favor.

27:08.772 --> 27:09.859
Of course he was.

27:09.892 --> 27:10.815
Okay.

27:10.857 --> 27:14.339
Well, uh, maybe if you weren't out
drinking all night with Annie...

27:14.372 --> 27:15.747
Right, Annie.

27:15.780 --> 27:19.394
You know, Gwen had some really interesting
things to tell me about you and her.

27:19.428 --> 27:21.859
How come you never told
me about you and Annie?

27:21.892 --> 27:24.858
Because you and Thad were
over there risking your lives,

27:24.859 --> 27:28.245
and the last thing either one of you
needed was to be worrying about her.

27:28.245 --> 27:31.845
But when you got home from that war, you
were in no place to deal with that, or...

27:32.759 --> 27:35.035
Man, or anything, for that matter.

27:35.036 --> 27:37.643
And any time over the last
four years or even tonight.

27:37.644 --> 27:42.238
Tee, it was never the right time,
okay? I wanted to protect you.

27:42.239 --> 27:46.001
And you don't think that I'd want to
know that my brother's wife was an addict?

27:46.002 --> 27:49.315
Of course. I didn't know that
she was back in our lives.

27:49.348 --> 27:52.547
And had you told me that she
was here, I would've told you.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.083
Well, she's here now,

27:54.116 --> 27:56.067
and you don't turn your back on family.

28:05.653 --> 28:07.580
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

28:07.676 --> 28:08.899
I'm not mad at you.

28:09.675 --> 28:12.259
I was worried 'cause you could've died.

28:12.292 --> 28:14.430
[Sighs] I bet Jordan would've loved that.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.872
From what I hear, she's helped
you quite a bit over the years.

28:16.899 --> 28:18.883
She told you that?

28:18.915 --> 28:20.739
No. Actually, she didn't.

28:20.772 --> 28:23.362
She knows how to keep a secret.

28:23.396 --> 28:26.818
So, I think you should
rethink how you feel about her.

28:27.492 --> 28:29.347
Look, you need help.

28:30.318 --> 28:31.843
So I want you to go to rehab.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.187
Been there, done that.

28:33.219 --> 28:37.107
It's just a bunch of pathetic
people talking about their problems.

28:38.061 --> 28:40.835
I don't have a problem, TC, believe me.

28:40.868 --> 28:44.227
Sure. But I want you to go, for me.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.339
So that I know you're okay.

28:46.372 --> 28:50.019
[Sighs] Fine.

28:50.052 --> 28:51.875
I'll look into it when I get to San Diego.

28:51.908 --> 28:54.851
No, I want you to go here so I can help.

28:55.458 --> 28:57.283
There's a place in San Antonio.

28:57.315 --> 29:00.643
And when you've recovered,
I'm gonna take you.

29:00.676 --> 29:02.678
Fine. [Sighs]

29:03.396 --> 29:05.123
I'll go.

29:05.604 --> 29:07.684
You know I love you, right?

29:09.220 --> 29:12.131
You're, like, the only family I have left.

29:17.117 --> 29:18.656
Let's take a look.

29:21.619 --> 29:24.051
[Coughing]

29:24.487 --> 29:28.370
Well, doesn't seem like anything serious.

29:28.677 --> 29:30.738
It's probably just a virus.

29:30.914 --> 29:32.833
How's the other guy look?

29:34.131 --> 29:36.530
I'll write you a prescription
for a strong cough medicine.

29:37.971 --> 29:39.492
That's it?

29:40.211 --> 29:41.458
Thanks, Doc.

29:41.492 --> 29:44.819
[Coughing]

29:49.124 --> 29:50.418
For me?

29:50.451 --> 29:52.211
Sorry, honey, it's for TC.

29:52.243 --> 29:53.650
- You still haven't told him?
- No.

29:53.683 --> 29:54.683
Still trying.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.924
But hey, he knows about the stalker now,

29:56.925 --> 29:58.853
so that's one less thing
I have to tell him about.

29:58.854 --> 29:59.897
That's something.

29:59.903 --> 30:02.671
Okay, so here's a week's worth
of antibiotics just to be safe.

30:02.672 --> 30:03.427
Thank you.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.942
And, uh, X-ray's open now if you
want to double check that ankle.

30:05.943 --> 30:08.181
- You might have to carry me.
- [Chuckles]

30:08.182 --> 30:09.596
[Chuckles]

30:09.872 --> 30:10.872
I'm out of here.

30:10.987 --> 30:12.292
Yeah, not a problem.

30:12.293 --> 30:13.861
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.083
- All righty.
- Whoo.

30:17.767 --> 30:18.553
Working out.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.091
- Feel that tri, huh?
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

30:20.092 --> 30:21.604
I'm working on that right tri, you know?

30:21.628 --> 30:22.820
- Looks good to me.
- [Chuckles]

30:22.844 --> 30:24.209
[Voice breaking] So, I have no choice?

30:24.210 --> 30:25.648
Krista: We did everything
we could in surgery,

30:25.649 --> 30:27.361
but the infection is just
spreading up your leg.

30:27.362 --> 30:28.589
We need to amputate, or you could lose

30:28.590 --> 30:30.596
- more than just your leg.
- But this, it was just a cut.

30:30.597 --> 30:32.840
This is crazy. It was just a cut.

30:32.841 --> 30:36.091
Krista: I'm sorry. I know this is a lot
to process in a short period of time.

30:36.124 --> 30:38.053
What about Malcolm? Malcolm have it?

30:38.054 --> 30:39.076
He was down there with me.

30:39.077 --> 30:40.635
He's okay. We checked him out.

30:41.090 --> 30:43.260
Just bad luck on your part.

30:43.446 --> 30:45.417
It's better me than him.

30:46.772 --> 30:48.312
I'm really scared.

30:48.518 --> 30:50.459
I'm just a single mom.

30:50.492 --> 30:53.211
I'll never be able to take
care of him with one leg.

30:55.196 --> 30:58.531
I know it feels like that
right now, but that's not true.

30:58.532 --> 30:59.227
[Crying]

30:59.424 --> 31:01.500
My little sister was a figure skater.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.123
She was amazing.

31:03.124 --> 31:04.244
She loved being on the ice.

31:04.917 --> 31:06.555
She lost a foot in a car accident

31:06.556 --> 31:08.187
when she was 16 years old.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.332
Thought she'd never be able to skate again.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.783
But guess where she is today?

31:11.784 --> 31:15.111
She's a princess in a Disney on Ice show.

31:15.868 --> 31:18.555
It is amazing what they
can do with prosthetics.

31:18.556 --> 31:20.924
Your life is hardly over because of this.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.770
[Chuckles]

31:22.771 --> 31:24.049
Thanks.

31:24.596 --> 31:27.987
We're gonna bring you
back in and put you under.

31:27.988 --> 31:28.988
You ready?

31:29.153 --> 31:32.353
Like you said, I have no choice, right?

31:34.939 --> 31:36.379
[Sighs]

31:47.002 --> 31:48.921
I... I'm so sorry about your sister.

31:48.922 --> 31:51.817
[Chuckles] My sister lives in Duluth.

31:51.848 --> 31:53.307
She's divorced with two kids.

31:53.339 --> 31:54.755
She's a blood-sucking attorney.

31:54.756 --> 31:56.612
Never skated a day in her life.

31:57.084 --> 31:59.533
It's important to try
and put patients at ease

31:59.534 --> 32:00.936
before a major surgery.

32:00.990 --> 32:03.261
It's a nice story. Always works.

32:04.908 --> 32:07.036
I'll put down the deposit
on the first month's rent.

32:07.036 --> 32:08.792
She won't be moving in
for at least another month,

32:08.793 --> 32:11.686
but I just wanted to check if
there was availability nearby.

32:11.951 --> 32:13.112
Okay, great, cool.

32:13.113 --> 32:14.744
Call me back. Good news, Annie.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.243
[Cellphone beeps]

32:24.725 --> 32:26.667
You have one job here.

32:26.668 --> 32:29.420
How can a patient walk right
out the front door of the ER?

32:29.452 --> 32:32.252
I'm sorry, Dr. Callahan. I'll
check the video footage immediately.

32:32.253 --> 32:32.875
Yeah.

32:32.876 --> 32:35.022
Okay, I'll call the police and
see if they can keep an eye out.

32:35.023 --> 32:37.476
No, no, she can't have gotten very far
away. I'm gonna go look for her myself.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.523
Okay, well, you want me to go with you?

32:38.524 --> 32:40.081
No, can you stay here
in case she comes back?

32:40.082 --> 32:40.549
Yeah.

32:40.550 --> 32:43.367
And Jordan, thank you for
trying to care for her back then.

32:43.913 --> 32:45.230
M... means a lot.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.044
- When is this shift over?
- Oh, in about an hour.

32:50.901 --> 32:52.668
We'll go get some breakfast.

32:52.669 --> 32:53.513
You go get breakfast.

32:53.514 --> 32:55.146
- I'm going to bed.
- Mm-hmm.

32:55.772 --> 32:57.690
[Coughing]

32:58.384 --> 32:59.902
I need some help here!

33:00.185 --> 33:01.431
[Gasping]

33:02.753 --> 33:04.262
I... can't... I... can't...

33:05.453 --> 33:07.628
[Strained] I can't breathe.

33:08.565 --> 33:11.209
I can't hear any breaths on the
right side. He has a collapsed lung.

33:11.210 --> 33:13.417
Go find a doctor. He needs a chest tube.

33:16.381 --> 33:18.811
- I'm losing pulse here!
- Oh, my God!

33:21.994 --> 33:24.228
Woman on PA: <i>Paging Dr. Zia and Alexander.</i>

33:24.229 --> 33:26.908
<i>Paging Dr. Zia and Alexander, stat.</i>

33:34.529 --> 33:37.823
[Gasping]

33:37.824 --> 33:40.303
[Coughs] What happened?

33:40.314 --> 33:42.617
He had a pneumo. I released the air.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.049
Let's get him in a room.

33:52.051 --> 33:53.693
Can you set the Pleur-evac to 20, please.

33:53.694 --> 33:54.868
Good air movement.

33:55.714 --> 33:56.833
Nice catch, Michael.

33:57.064 --> 33:58.375
Thanks.

33:58.376 --> 34:00.198
- What happened?
- Wasn't this your patient?

34:00.414 --> 34:01.501
Yeah, he had a cough.

34:01.502 --> 34:02.844
Yeah, from a collapsed lung.

34:02.845 --> 34:04.965
Did you get an X-ray or even listen to him?

34:06.141 --> 34:07.764
- You got this?
- Yeah.

34:07.765 --> 34:09.844
Drew, follow me. Now.

34:13.148 --> 34:15.331
See that? Your dad is a total badass.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.967
[Chuckles]

34:25.826 --> 34:27.617
What the hell is going on?

34:27.618 --> 34:28.853
Sorry, I missed it.

34:28.853 --> 34:29.940
It's easy to miss,

34:30.242 --> 34:32.034
but you usually catch these things.

34:32.034 --> 34:33.226
It won't happen again.

34:33.228 --> 34:37.051
Drew, I'm talking to you as
your friend, not your boss.

34:38.542 --> 34:39.693
Come on, tell me.

34:41.542 --> 34:43.396
Just having trouble with the Rick stuff.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.150
Burning the candle pretty hard at both ends

34:45.150 --> 34:46.668
just trying to forget about it.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.630
The guy that was here...

34:49.860 --> 34:52.677
I slept with his boyfriend last night.

34:52.710 --> 34:54.308
So, he was pissed.

34:54.703 --> 34:57.421
You don't... have to tell me the details,

34:57.422 --> 34:59.836
but that stuff cannot happen here.

34:59.837 --> 35:01.899
- I know.
- This isn't who you are.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.040
I mean, not just tonight, but...

35:04.130 --> 35:07.521
Going out and this getting crazy stuff.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.121
You're a homebody.

35:09.885 --> 35:10.908
I know.

35:11.004 --> 35:14.116
You know, one day you're gonna find a guy.

35:14.150 --> 35:17.733
It probably won't be in a bar at 4:00 A.M.

35:17.766 --> 35:20.613
I just did everything right with Rick...

35:22.309 --> 35:23.480
I thought.

35:23.570 --> 35:27.985
I cared for him. I was patient.

35:28.773 --> 35:30.990
There was nothing else I
could've done to make that work,

35:31.014 --> 35:32.931
and he still left me.

35:33.894 --> 35:35.632
He's gone.

35:36.198 --> 35:38.976
Doesn't return my phone
calls or my e-mails.

35:39.686 --> 35:41.265
That's not fair.

35:44.134 --> 35:46.903
It's not the way this
was supposed to work out.

35:47.391 --> 35:48.950
I'm sorry, man.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.204
[Chuckles]

35:51.729 --> 35:56.649
Look, I... I can't offer you
the love of a good man, but,

35:56.650 --> 35:58.992
- [Chuckles, sniffles]
- But...

35:58.993 --> 36:00.837
why... why don't you come
over for dinner tonight?

36:00.838 --> 36:04.933
Janet can cook, we can watch
the game, you can see the twins.

36:04.966 --> 36:06.913
It's been awhile since we've hung out.

36:07.356 --> 36:11.972
Mm-hmm. Yeah. All right.

36:12.006 --> 36:14.495
Sounds good. Thanks.

36:16.741 --> 36:20.277
You know, may... maybe, maybe
you should stop at Whataburger

36:20.278 --> 36:22.087
and pick us up some food.

36:22.088 --> 36:24.287
Janet is a r... really bad cook.

36:24.288 --> 36:24.983
[Laughs]

36:24.984 --> 36:26.402
You... you did not hear that from me.

36:26.403 --> 36:27.521
[Coughs]

36:33.222 --> 36:36.293
Well, the post-op imaging looks good.

36:36.325 --> 36:37.988
Looks like we stopped the infection.

36:38.022 --> 36:39.828
I'm sorry we couldn't save your leg.

36:39.829 --> 36:41.844
I'm just thankful I'm alive.

36:41.849 --> 36:43.164
Hey, thought you might like a roommate.

36:43.165 --> 36:44.747
My baby. [Chuckles]

36:44.965 --> 36:47.717
- He hates when I call him that.
- [Chuckles]

36:47.749 --> 36:49.029
Aww.

36:49.061 --> 36:51.877
How you doing?

36:51.910 --> 36:54.116
I'm fine. I'm just, um...

36:54.530 --> 36:55.794
[Sighs]

36:55.795 --> 36:57.796
I never want to go camping again.

36:57.830 --> 36:59.012
It's a deal.

36:59.046 --> 37:00.588
Jordan: Well, you'll be glad to know

37:00.589 --> 37:02.404
that he is going to make a full recovery.

37:02.438 --> 37:04.549
The answer to my prayers.

37:04.582 --> 37:06.213
Thank you, Doctors.

37:06.245 --> 37:08.325
Thank you.

37:09.766 --> 37:11.279
I love you.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.272
Love you, too.

37:18.215 --> 37:19.767
You saved that guy's life, didn't you?

37:21.238 --> 37:22.261
Uh...

37:22.262 --> 37:25.509
Right place at the right time, I guess.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.452
[Chuckles] Totally get it now.

37:27.845 --> 37:28.950
Get what?

37:29.026 --> 37:30.628
Why you want to do what you want to do.

37:31.479 --> 37:33.704
Seeing you jump in to help that guy,

37:33.705 --> 37:35.560
must make you feel like
you can do anything.

37:36.483 --> 37:39.330
I'm happy you're not
miserable anymore, Dad.

37:39.446 --> 37:41.686
You're gonna make a great doctor.

37:41.687 --> 37:43.485
- You think?
- Yeah.

37:44.234 --> 37:46.044
Totally worth getting peed on.

37:46.045 --> 37:47.068
I...

37:47.069 --> 37:49.308
- I was not peed on.
- [Chuckles]

37:49.309 --> 37:51.257
I spilled a pee sample.

37:51.258 --> 37:52.473
Well, have you ever been peed on?

37:52.474 --> 37:53.529
Yes.

37:53.530 --> 37:56.569
About a million times by you as a baby.

37:56.570 --> 37:57.355
[Laughs]

37:57.356 --> 37:58.378
Come here.

38:01.898 --> 38:03.369
Ooh, tough break.

38:03.401 --> 38:06.590
Looks like a displaced and
angulated ankle fracture.

38:06.591 --> 38:07.459
Are you serious?

38:07.460 --> 38:08.988
No, I'm just messing with you. [Chuckles]

38:08.989 --> 38:10.236
- Oh.
- You're looking good.

38:10.237 --> 38:12.829
Let me know if you ever need
help picking your fantasy team.

38:12.830 --> 38:14.076
How about right now?

38:14.077 --> 38:15.406
- Really?
- Shift's over.

38:15.407 --> 38:16.718
I'm not doing anything.

38:17.060 --> 38:19.651
And apparently, I can use
some fantasy football tips.

38:19.652 --> 38:21.352
- That is not a lie.
- Mm-hmm.

38:21.353 --> 38:22.472
I'll teach you about this game.

38:22.473 --> 38:23.880
Oh, you're gonna teach me about this game?

38:23.881 --> 38:25.576
- Yeah. [Laughs]
- Know what you're talking about.

38:25.577 --> 38:26.632
Where'd you like to eat?

38:26.633 --> 38:28.322
- I want some pancakes.
- Yeah.

38:28.323 --> 38:29.748
I want some grits, too, actually.

38:29.749 --> 38:32.019
[Laughs] Lord, here we
go. What did I sign up for?

38:32.020 --> 38:33.926
- What's wrong with grits?
- What did I sign up for?

38:33.927 --> 38:34.950
You don't like grits?

38:34.951 --> 38:36.107
- [Laughs]
- I love grits.

38:36.108 --> 38:38.127
* Why is every cover *

38:38.176 --> 38:39.736
-

38:42.345 --> 38:45.417
- * That hides their wreck below *
- -

38:47.497 --> 38:48.497
Hey.

38:49.404 --> 38:51.130
So, can an a-hole buy you breakfast

38:51.163 --> 38:53.263
to make up for being a jerk earlier?

38:53.264 --> 38:54.456
Better be pretty good breakfast.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.602
It is. It's this great, little place.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.983
99 cents, all you can eat.

38:59.578 --> 39:01.422
You had me at a-hole.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.791
[Both chuckle]

39:02.792 --> 39:06.375
* When you know I'm a liar *

39:08.731 --> 39:11.369
* When you gonna want a little more *

39:11.370 --> 39:13.481
Well, she took everything.

39:14.108 --> 39:15.835
Sorry, Jordan. Guess you were right.

39:15.836 --> 39:16.686
She cleaned me out.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.688
Don't apologize.

39:19.986 --> 39:21.778
I didn't see it coming, you know?

39:21.779 --> 39:23.384
Try to do your best for someone.

39:35.602 --> 39:37.439
* 'Cause it's just got burned *

39:37.440 --> 39:38.719
I'm pregnant.

39:39.431 --> 39:41.989
* Cannot shaken *

39:44.859 --> 39:47.348
I'm pregnant.

39:47.349 --> 39:49.098
[Both chuckle]

39:49.099 --> 39:52.427
* 'Cause it's all the earth *

39:52.428 --> 39:55.751
* And the water's wasted *

39:55.821 --> 39:58.955
* The wind is blowing down *
