WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.800
â™ªâ™ª

00:01.843 --> 00:03.206
[Sam] Come on, Rocket.

00:03.312 --> 00:06.841
You said I'd be done after I scraped
the space whale barf off the hull.

00:07.081 --> 00:10.449
But that's before we knew all the
vents were clogged with the stuff too.

00:12.597 --> 00:15.227
- [groans]
- Called "pulling your weight," Sam.

00:15.383 --> 00:18.278
It was good enough for me when 
I was a Ravager. Builds character.

00:18.372 --> 00:20.635
Well, can I at least
take a study break?

00:20.847 --> 00:22.705
I got a geometry final
next week.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.168
Are... Are you serious?

00:25.275 --> 00:28.730
I'm a galactic hero, and I never
even finished fifth grade.

00:28.816 --> 00:30.461
You know what's cool
about space, Sam?

00:30.608 --> 00:33.775
- [singsongy] No tests!
- [Drax] Not true, Quill.

00:33.839 --> 00:36.688
I have been tested in
battle and won every time.

00:37.025 --> 00:39.668
Well, I've been tested
<i>on</i> a bunch of times.

00:39.855 --> 00:43.559
- I don't recommend it.
- I am Groot.

00:43.726 --> 00:46.932
More to the point, there's a
Nova Corps APB out for you, Sam.

00:47.283 --> 00:50.985
Not to mention a ten-million-unit
reward for this baby...

00:51.098 --> 00:52.457
[screaming]

00:52.568 --> 00:54.693
[groans] Pfft!

00:54.775 --> 00:57.194
The last place you need
to be is the first place

00:57.240 --> 00:59.533
everyone in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.852
Well, it's not just
school for me, Gamora.

01:02.097 --> 01:04.188
It's home. I get it, Sam,

01:04.340 --> 01:07.428
but my dad is still out there with
a bunch of stolen Centurion helmets.

01:07.588 --> 01:10.215
If we don't stop him,
nobody's gonna have a home.

01:10.325 --> 01:14.083
You know, Sam might be able to
use his helmet to track J'Son.

01:14.364 --> 01:16.799
Look, I didn't sign up
to save the galaxy, okay?

01:16.993 --> 01:19.616
I just wanna find my dad.
So if I track anyone

01:19.718 --> 01:21.878
with this helmet,
it'll be him first.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.854
[gasps, yells]

01:29.427 --> 01:31.345
Sam! Are you all right?

01:31.561 --> 01:34.381
I think I saw the last thing
that my dad saw in this helmet.

01:34.571 --> 01:36.472
Maybe the last thing he ever saw.

01:36.901 --> 01:39.391
It's like he... overloaded.

01:39.525 --> 01:42.055
Okay, look,
but that doesn't mean he...

01:42.132 --> 01:45.167
The point is, we've got all the time
in the world to figure this out.

01:45.254 --> 01:47.440
<i>All right, Quill. Pull over.</i>

01:47.634 --> 01:49.884
<i>We know you have
the Centurion helmet.</i>

01:53.958 --> 01:56.769
Hand it over,
or I will use force.

01:56.862 --> 01:58.921
You have five seconds
to comply.

01:59.554 --> 02:02.236
<i>Four. Three.</i>

02:02.716 --> 02:05.281
Two. One.

02:05.388 --> 02:07.401
<i>Wait! Wait! Ho-ho! Hey!</i>

02:07.468 --> 02:09.814
Dey! Hey, stop counting!
Hey! H-Hi!

02:09.881 --> 02:13.564
I... Loo... I swear we don't know
anything about any helmet.

02:13.744 --> 02:15.013
- Right, Rocket?
- Uhh...

02:15.374 --> 02:16.656
[grunting]

02:17.771 --> 02:20.464
Right. But if, you know,
theoretically,

02:20.529 --> 02:23.383
we could manage to
obtain this alleged item,

02:23.468 --> 02:26.782
would Nova Corps consider
upping the bounty to, say,

02:26.877 --> 02:30.170
- 20 million units? [groans]
- <i>Nice try.</i>

02:30.250 --> 02:33.360
But we already traced the helmet's
energy signature to your...

02:33.546 --> 02:35.370
Wait. Where did it go?

02:35.530 --> 02:37.283
You are correct, Rhomann Dey.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.873
The helmet we do not know about
is no longer here, nor is Sam.

02:41.113 --> 02:42.309
Found him.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.645
Leave me alone!

02:49.944 --> 02:54.945

Incoming hostile!

03:03.942 --> 03:04.955
- What...
- [grunts]

03:04.989 --> 03:06.306
- Part of that...
- [grunts]

03:06.402 --> 03:07.539
- Did you not...
- [grunts]

03:07.646 --> 03:08.979
Understand?

03:09.072 --> 03:11.838
Engage Energy Restraints now!

03:14.850 --> 03:18.503
[grunting, groaning]

03:26.390 --> 03:27.505
Oh, that's it!

03:27.531 --> 03:29.957
My price just went up
to 30 million units!

03:30.064 --> 03:32.996
How about 20 units to the first
one to knock out a restraint?

03:33.130 --> 03:35.038
You're on.

03:38.497 --> 03:41.331
Gamora, how about
a little distraction?

03:41.508 --> 03:43.251
- On it.
- [Engine revs]

03:47.270 --> 03:48.616
[gasping]

03:50.410 --> 03:53.299
Ha! I win. In your face, Quill!

03:54.672 --> 03:57.205
Okay, fine. Last one, double or nothing.

04:01.099 --> 04:02.712
[grunting]

04:03.585 --> 04:05.443
I don't have time for this.

04:08.326 --> 04:11.785
Don't know where he's going,
but it better be super-important.

04:12.548 --> 04:15.819
Hey! Let go, Dey! We ain't
got the helmet no more!

04:16.081 --> 04:18.358
[Quill] Not that we ever did.

04:18.435 --> 04:22.601
No, but I'm betting you have a
pretty good idea where it went.

04:27.617 --> 04:29.144
[grunts]

04:29.830 --> 04:32.255
Okay. Now what?

04:46.503 --> 04:47.699
[groans]

04:47.751 --> 04:50.090
[groans] Still gotta
work on those landings.

04:58.648 --> 05:00.593
[sniffs, sighs]

05:01.633 --> 05:05.462
- Mom? Kaelynn?
- Sam!

05:05.776 --> 05:07.337
Where have you been?

05:07.524 --> 05:11.041
Holed up cramming somewhere,
I hope, for your sake.

05:11.131 --> 05:13.957
Carrie. Hey. Uh,
what... what do you mean?

05:14.204 --> 05:17.615
Monday morning.
Finals week. Hello!

05:17.762 --> 05:19.954
Wait. Monday? I've been in sp...

05:20.048 --> 05:22.867
Uh, out of town for a whole week?

05:23.080 --> 05:26.110
Dude, you are such a space cadet.

05:26.372 --> 05:27.672
Hey.

05:35.104 --> 05:38.284
[grunts] What the flarg did ya
think you were doing back there?

05:38.388 --> 05:40.043
We were rescuing you.

05:40.201 --> 05:41.923
And losing the Nova Corps.

05:42.016 --> 05:44.067
Don't congratulate yourselves just yet.

05:44.163 --> 05:46.730
We still need to find Sam
before anyone else does.

05:46.891 --> 05:48.417
If he was traveling at Nova speed,

05:48.494 --> 05:51.426
I could maybe kluge some sort
of particle flux detector

05:51.506 --> 05:53.393
to try and pick up his
displacement signature.

05:53.493 --> 05:55.337
I am Groot.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.953
What do you mean you planted a thorn
on the kid when he wasn't looking?

05:59.020 --> 06:02.348
And since when can you
use thorns as trackers?

06:02.395 --> 06:04.814
I am Groot.

06:08.544 --> 06:10.469
[bell ringing]

06:16.577 --> 06:19.845
Stupid space time. How
was I supposed to know?

06:20.512 --> 06:22.109
Give it back, Karl!

06:22.662 --> 06:25.363
I would so rather be
fighting space cops right now.

06:25.479 --> 06:27.704
I don't see any space cops,
nerd boy,

06:27.799 --> 06:30.180
so maybe you should
just fight me.

06:30.318 --> 06:32.699
Principal Philbin! Sir!

06:34.512 --> 06:37.342
Okay, let's have it, Alexander.

06:37.836 --> 06:39.642
Have what, sir?

06:39.801 --> 06:43.041
Your excuse for missing
a full week of classes.

06:43.106 --> 06:46.444
I need a laugh. Were you
deployed on a top secret mission,

06:46.524 --> 06:49.557
rescuing orphans
abducted by aliens?

06:49.769 --> 06:52.805
[nervous chuckle] Uh, funny story...

06:53.404 --> 06:55.893
Fine. You can explain
it to me later.

06:55.926 --> 06:57.158
In detention!

06:57.338 --> 06:58.860
Busted!

07:07.249 --> 07:08.590
Hmm?

07:10.422 --> 07:13.106
You! Are you the one
in charge here?

07:13.288 --> 07:15.881
Yes. What can I do
for you, Officer?

07:16.114 --> 07:18.511
Have you seen this boy?

07:21.833 --> 07:24.858
[Principal Philbin] Sam's permanent
record file, as you requested, Officer.

07:24.911 --> 07:29.548
I think a visit to his family from
the law will help set the boy straight.

07:32.215 --> 07:33.799
I couldn't agree more.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.531
Ow! [Groans]

07:47.953 --> 07:51.824
Aw, I'm doomed.
I'd do anything to get out of this.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.484
[students scream]

07:58.437 --> 08:00.146
The helmet! Now!

08:00.464 --> 08:02.975
Okay. Maybe not anything.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.251
[students shouting]

08:06.851 --> 08:08.593
<i>[Principal Philbin over
P.A.] Please remain calm</i>

08:08.617 --> 08:11.145
<i>and exit the building
in an orderly fashion.</i>

08:11.225 --> 08:12.692
[panting]

08:12.860 --> 08:14.385
[grunts]

08:14.420 --> 08:16.803
[groans] Huh?

08:19.723 --> 08:21.679
Looking for something, Samuel?

08:22.151 --> 08:23.167
Uh...

08:26.921 --> 08:30.538
All kinds of personal information here.

08:38.404 --> 08:40.751
But where is your helmet?

08:48.120 --> 08:49.686
[J'Son groans]

08:49.721 --> 08:51.283
[students clamoring]

08:55.173 --> 08:57.240
Oh, hey. Found it.

08:59.323 --> 09:01.915
Who... What are you?

09:02.157 --> 09:03.737
- [grunts]
- Wait!

09:04.013 --> 09:06.093
- [screaming]
- [Sam, in mature voice] Uh, it's okay.

09:06.831 --> 09:11.252
I'm the good helmet guy, and
that's the <i> bad</i> helmet guy.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.567
[screaming continues]

09:14.749 --> 09:17.400
Incidentally,
I'd recommend excusing

09:17.536 --> 09:19.708
all students from finals.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.752
Especially that brave young man,

09:21.947 --> 09:24.175
Sam Alexander.

09:25.539 --> 09:28.901
[normal voice] Let's keep this
between you and me, jerk face!

09:33.043 --> 09:34.406
Aah!

09:36.159 --> 09:37.856
[grunts]

09:39.108 --> 09:42.948
I tried using reason.
Now I'm using force!

09:43.533 --> 09:45.065
Force this!

09:45.803 --> 09:48.311
[both grunting]

09:52.008 --> 09:53.734
[groans]

10:07.950 --> 10:11.025
[both grunting]

10:11.061 --> 10:12.856
[screams, grunts]

10:24.694 --> 10:26.514
Why the hesitation, Sam?

10:26.736 --> 10:28.758
Afraid of a little collateral damage?

10:33.118 --> 10:35.670
[grunts, groans]

10:37.186 --> 10:39.825
This is why I don't play football.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.991
[thud]

10:48.392 --> 10:49.746
The good news is we found Sam.

10:49.839 --> 10:51.347
- [thud]
- [all grunt]

10:51.372 --> 10:53.673
The bad news is
we're not the only ones.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.322
- [Quill] What?
- Seriously?

10:55.566 --> 10:58.201
For years, I couldn't find
my dad. Now I can't lose him.

10:58.401 --> 11:02.277
Okay, new plan. Rocket, Gamora,
keep him busy. We'll grab Sam.

11:02.358 --> 11:05.152
You want busy?
I'll show ya busy!

11:05.459 --> 11:06.773
[grunting]

11:10.100 --> 11:11.972
Huh. Show-off.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.237
[growls]

11:21.944 --> 11:23.260
[yells]

11:26.829 --> 11:27.911
[all grunt]

11:29.973 --> 11:31.123
[yells]

11:37.620 --> 11:39.245
[both grunt]

11:42.006 --> 11:45.505
The thing is, Sam, your
helmet is keyed to your DNA,

11:45.607 --> 11:47.075
so I can't just remove it.

11:47.459 --> 11:50.074
At least not while you're alive.

11:50.491 --> 11:51.564
[grunts]

11:51.605 --> 11:53.398
I am Groot!

11:58.862 --> 12:01.317
[Drax] Yes! Touchdown in the end zone!

12:01.543 --> 12:03.530
What? Since when
do you know football?

12:03.610 --> 12:06.936
Our ship was touching down in
that zone at the end of the field.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.983
[yells]

12:13.513 --> 12:16.975
I can't believe you
ditched us to go to school!

12:17.095 --> 12:19.005
Can we talk about this later?

12:19.464 --> 12:21.305
- [growls]
- [beeps]

12:23.469 --> 12:25.043
[all grunt]

12:25.305 --> 12:26.613
[grunts]

12:35.593 --> 12:37.000
Dad, no!

12:37.399 --> 12:39.206
A noble gesture, Peter,

12:39.372 --> 12:42.202
but you know I won't hesitate
to blow both of you away.

12:42.237 --> 12:43.946
[aircraft approaching]

12:48.669 --> 12:50.967
Then we got something in common.

12:51.282 --> 12:54.101
The "not hesitating to
blow <i> you</i> away" part.

12:54.490 --> 12:56.315
Adorable.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.484
- Is that... it?
- [distant sirens wailing]

13:14.911 --> 13:16.446
Yeah, I know.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.060
Feels like we were just
getting started here.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.249
[sirens approaching]

13:28.678 --> 13:31.515
Well, better hope this doesn't
end up on your permanent record.

13:31.713 --> 13:34.494
"Permanent record."
He knows where I live.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.741
Sam, you okay?

13:36.917 --> 13:38.384
[screaming]

13:39.870 --> 13:43.842
So, yeah, about this...

13:43.922 --> 13:48.529
- We're, um, with the Avengers.
- [screaming continues]

13:48.896 --> 13:50.753
Anyway, you know,
you're all safe now. Hmm?

13:50.874 --> 13:52.717
So please send all invoices for loss

13:52.797 --> 13:55.549
or destruction of property
to Stark Industries.

13:56.089 --> 13:58.326
And in the meantime,
our super-powered, super-awesome

13:58.399 --> 14:00.199
helmeted friend here
will repair the... Wha...

14:00.440 --> 14:03.558
- Wha... Where'd he go?
- I am Groot.

14:13.442 --> 14:15.617
Mom? Kaelynn?

14:19.730 --> 14:21.246
Hello, Samuel.

14:21.511 --> 14:23.420
We were just talking about you.

14:30.181 --> 14:31.995
Samuel Alexander!

14:32.575 --> 14:35.248
[singsongy]
Uh-oh. Sammy's in trouble.

14:35.367 --> 14:37.275
Where have you been
for the last week?

14:37.391 --> 14:39.185
I was worried sick about you!

14:39.437 --> 14:41.476
Stay away from my family.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.481
I was just following up on the missing

14:43.561 --> 14:46.008
persons report your
mother filed, Samuel.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.476
There's also the matter
of a certain missing item.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.786
Are we clear now?

14:56.119 --> 14:57.141
Mom!

14:57.357 --> 14:59.899
Sam? Is there something
you need to tell me?

15:00.078 --> 15:03.688
What? Me?
Yes. No. Uh, ooh, maybe.

15:03.818 --> 15:07.440
Well, I'm sure if we all just
sit back down and talk this out,

15:07.480 --> 15:10.328
- we'll get to the bottom of it.
- [doorbell ringing, knocking]

15:12.200 --> 15:15.114
Um, hi. City Exterminator.

15:15.195 --> 15:18.692
Uh, I was just passing by and noticed
this critter in your tree there.

15:18.801 --> 15:21.445
Just wanted to discuss
all of our options before

15:21.531 --> 15:24.773
anyone does anything rash.

15:28.456 --> 15:30.016
So critters get in and out through what

15:30.100 --> 15:32.788
we like to call "entrances and exits."

15:33.150 --> 15:36.823
Very important to know
where all those are.

15:36.944 --> 15:38.744
It's their house.

15:38.853 --> 15:40.920
I think they know where the doors are.

15:41.183 --> 15:43.678
No, no. That's, uh,
very helpful.

15:43.784 --> 15:46.471
Entrances and exits.
Got that, Sam?

15:48.265 --> 15:49.265
Got it.

15:50.973 --> 15:52.893
Mommy! Why did you...

15:53.023 --> 15:55.530
No need to fuss, dear.
Accidents happen.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.202
Let's get you changed.

15:58.678 --> 15:59.894
Oops!

16:03.747 --> 16:05.459
Keep him busy, okay?

16:05.877 --> 16:08.846
You mean irritate my dad? Yeah.

16:09.073 --> 16:11.269
[grunting]

16:11.304 --> 16:13.189
Gee, Dad, you don't look so good.

16:13.383 --> 16:14.784
Anything you wanna confess?

16:14.818 --> 16:17.297
Like where you put those
Centurion helmets you stole?

16:17.384 --> 16:19.883
I'm fine, Peter.

16:19.969 --> 16:23.636
And the helmets, unlike
you, are perfectly safe.

16:28.631 --> 16:31.514
[in mature voice] Let's get
these citizens to safety.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.894
Uh, what's with the corny voice?

16:34.309 --> 16:35.407
- What?
- [Grunts]

16:35.564 --> 16:36.573
[gasps]

16:36.618 --> 16:38.484
Mommy, he talks!

16:38.581 --> 16:41.241
Can I keep him? Please!

16:41.644 --> 16:42.935
Huh?

16:43.844 --> 16:45.695
[yelling]

16:45.872 --> 16:48.246
Careful, honey.
You don't know where he's been,

16:48.360 --> 16:50.725
- or what he is.
- [yelling continues]

16:54.944 --> 16:57.940
[grunts] Drax the Destroyer
will protect these frail humans.

16:58.177 --> 16:59.360
[explosion]

16:59.534 --> 17:02.453
[yells, groans]

17:08.157 --> 17:10.798
[J'Son] Does anyone
else wish to annoy me?

17:11.205 --> 17:13.824
I still got some annoying left in me.

17:15.614 --> 17:17.314
Figured it was worth a shot.

17:17.974 --> 17:19.425
[yelling]

17:20.641 --> 17:21.973
[cries out]

17:23.835 --> 17:25.041
[grunts]

17:25.078 --> 17:27.520
[roars]

17:32.692 --> 17:34.765
Got him! Maintain formation.

17:34.898 --> 17:37.572
[grunts, yells]

17:39.150 --> 17:40.877
What's he doing?

17:41.345 --> 17:43.576
He's going SuperNova!

17:45.331 --> 17:48.108
- That flash...
- I've seen it before.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.717
Listen to me! I don't care
what you do to yourself,

17:52.867 --> 17:55.088
but you have no idea
what you're dealing with.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.474
I saw my father...

17:56.625 --> 18:01.309
Your father couldn't
handle the power! I can!

18:13.720 --> 18:15.313
I am Groot!

18:15.378 --> 18:17.751
No way he'd try that trick again.

18:20.550 --> 18:22.742
The restraints contained
the worst of that blast,

18:22.856 --> 18:25.835
but the next one could
take out the whole town.

18:26.661 --> 18:28.853
- [screaming]
- No!

18:33.813 --> 18:37.634
I tried reason. Now I'm using force!

18:41.093 --> 18:43.475
Sam, no! Are you nuts, kid?

19:05.964 --> 19:08.255
Sam! Wait.

19:08.342 --> 19:10.814
That's not flying. That's falling!

19:10.852 --> 19:12.012
Groot, give me a boost, fast!

19:14.354 --> 19:16.862
- [yells]
- [grunts]

19:16.898 --> 19:18.798
No, not that fast!

19:29.949 --> 19:31.183
[grunts]

19:32.293 --> 19:34.040
[groaning]

19:35.425 --> 19:36.539
[groans]

19:37.092 --> 19:39.049
Thanks, Quill. You okay?

19:39.393 --> 19:41.070
Never mind me.

19:41.185 --> 19:43.421
- What about J'Son?
- I don't know.

19:43.548 --> 19:46.494
I had to motor outta there
before he... whatever he did.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.739
Brave work, son.
But I still need that helmet.

19:58.025 --> 20:00.445
- Why?
- 'Cause nobody's supposed to know

20:00.516 --> 20:04.764
his dad secretly worked for the
Nova Corps black ops task force?

20:04.917 --> 20:06.630
H-How did you know that?

20:06.717 --> 20:08.955
I am Groot.

20:09.315 --> 20:10.455
What the tree means

20:10.519 --> 20:12.826
is we hacked into the
Nova Corps database.

20:13.027 --> 20:16.422
You, uh, might wanna think about
updating your security protocols.

20:16.855 --> 20:18.988
[groans] It's true.

20:19.112 --> 20:23.198
Jesse Alexander already had the
helmet by the time we found him.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.835
We couldn't remove it,
so we trained him instead.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.908
How about giving Sam
the same deal?

20:28.042 --> 20:30.036
Do I get a say in this too?

20:30.978 --> 20:35.108
[in mature voice] Uh, sorry, ma'am,
but this is a classified conversation.

20:35.288 --> 20:37.705
All right, whoever you are.

20:37.832 --> 20:40.557
But work on that voice.
It is a little corny.

20:41.375 --> 20:44.212
Okay, kid.
You've earned that much today.

20:44.296 --> 20:46.816
We'll train you.
But he trains here on Earth.

20:46.883 --> 20:49.104
[in normal voice] Wait.
Aren't you the guy who bragged

20:49.177 --> 20:51.840
about becoming a space hero
on a fifth-grade education?

20:52.083 --> 20:55.026
Look, I've done some
extremely cool stuff.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.919
But I'd give it all up to
spend one more day with my mom.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.405
Kaelynn, why don't you go play
with your fuzzy new friend?

21:03.524 --> 21:04.913
What?

21:05.123 --> 21:07.621
- [yelling]
- [Kaelynn] Yay!

21:08.208 --> 21:09.954
Homework and chores first.

21:10.085 --> 21:13.491
But, yes, your dad
would be proud, Sam.

21:16.103 --> 21:17.534
As are we.

21:18.314 --> 21:20.353
Remember, you always have family...

21:20.513 --> 21:22.617
- Here and in space.
- [Kaelynn] Whee!

21:22.744 --> 21:24.740
[grumbling] Again! Again!

21:24.827 --> 21:27.218
For better or worse.
