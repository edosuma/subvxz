WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.072
(Wu)
Previously, on "Ninjago.."

00:05.339 --> 00:07.275
The apparatus won't activate

00:07.308 --> 00:10.211
'unless all four
time blades are in it.'

00:10.244 --> 00:13.181
- Kai, my son.
- Traitor!

00:13.214 --> 00:15.116
They forced us to work for them.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.385
If you want to save your master

00:17.418 --> 00:19.820
you will retrieve
the fourth blade!

00:19.853 --> 00:22.123
* Jump up kick back

00:23.157 --> 00:25.293
* Jump up kick back

00:26.694 --> 00:28.096
* Jump up kick back

00:28.129 --> 00:30.030
* Jump up kick back

00:31.265 --> 00:33.334
* Jump up kick back

00:34.335 --> 00:37.605
* Jump up kick back

00:37.638 --> 00:39.273
* Jump up kick back

00:39.307 --> 00:42.676
* Whip around and spin *

Episode 73

00:44.445 --> 00:48.116
"Out Of The Fire
And Into The Boiling Sea."

00:48.149 --> 00:50.584
[thunder rumbling]

00:50.618 --> 00:53.587
[intense music]

00:55.256 --> 00:57.158
(Machia)
Destination dead ahead.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.560
Excellent,
Supreme Commander, Machia.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.663
The final Time Blade
will soon be ours.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.198
Unless this is all a ninja trick

01:04.232 --> 01:06.200
to trap us
in the middle of nowhere.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.102
It had best not be

01:08.136 --> 01:09.570
for his sake.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.807
Argh! We can't do this!

01:13.841 --> 01:15.443
We can't let Krux and Acronix

01:15.476 --> 01:17.445
force us into getting
the last Time Blade for them.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.880
It's reversal power
is the only way to undo

01:19.913 --> 01:22.850
the effects of the
Time Punch on Master Wu.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.185
What other choice do we have--

01:24.218 --> 01:26.487
Time is short
and our friend's survival

01:26.520 --> 01:29.357
your master's survival
is at stake.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.460
Your father's right,
focus on the task at hand.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.229
Retrieving the Time Blade
will be more dangerous

01:35.263 --> 01:36.597
'than you can possibly imagine.'

01:36.630 --> 01:39.433
[thunder rumbles]
Whoa! I don't get it.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.369
Why did you put the Time Blade
way out here?

01:41.402 --> 01:43.604
It was so powerful, that Wu knew

01:43.637 --> 01:45.706
it would had to be hidden
somewhere safe.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.608
So, he asked us to seal it

01:47.641 --> 01:50.444
in the ancient library
of Hono Mizu.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.912
Hono, what now?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.515
Hono Mizu was once
a thriving port town

01:54.548 --> 01:57.585
that was consumed
by an undersea volcano

01:57.618 --> 01:59.753
that buried the city
leagues below

01:59.787 --> 02:02.356
an impossibly harsh environment.

02:02.390 --> 02:06.260
A combination of fire and water.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.497
The Boiling Sea.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.465
[intense music]

02:14.568 --> 02:17.371
Ew, no matter
how many times you see it

02:17.405 --> 02:19.373
watching those
suckers hatch is gross.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.610
Jay, less watching,
more helping!

02:22.643 --> 02:24.678
You know, guys, I was thinking
now that we've gotten

02:24.712 --> 02:27.548
Ninjago's workers out of here,
maybe we should join them.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.383
(Nya)
What about Master Wu?

02:29.417 --> 02:31.785
He's gone,
it's a strategic retreat!

02:31.819 --> 02:35.389
Strategic retreat is just
a fancy way of saying giving up.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.557
What do you think, Lloyd?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.326
You're the master
in training here.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.261
We need to regroup
at the temple.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.230
Zane, cover Ice.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.265
whoosh

02:46.234 --> 02:47.935
[hissing]

02:47.968 --> 02:50.304
Tank squadron, report.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.343
Quick, before they get through!

02:55.376 --> 02:57.445
[beeps]
One moment.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.347
- I'm getting a signal.
- Oh, yeah?

02:59.380 --> 03:01.249
Does it sound
anything like this?

03:01.282 --> 03:03.251
Move your butt, Zane!

03:03.284 --> 03:05.286
Cyrus Borg, I must retrieve him.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.321
Wait!
You're totally outnumbered.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.423
He's right,
there's like a million more

03:09.457 --> 03:10.858
Vermilion out there.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.293
There's no way you could

03:12.326 --> 03:14.295
possibly save him
all by yourself.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.797
So, I'm coming with you.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.366
What? We're Ninja.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.701
Saving people is,
you know, what we do.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.903
Yes, we do.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.638
(Nya)
Take cover!

03:24.672 --> 03:26.407
crash

03:28.008 --> 03:29.443
Where are they?

03:29.477 --> 03:32.280
Vermillion, check the tunnel.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.616
Any sign of escape?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.919
Do you know what this means?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.355
The Ninja have been eliminated!

03:41.389 --> 03:42.856
[in unison]
Victory!

03:42.890 --> 03:44.692
[laughs]

03:45.826 --> 03:47.295
Or they found another exit.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.962
Either way, they're gone.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.831
There's work to be done.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.600
All Vermilion stand down.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.336
Return to the dome immediately.

03:56.604 --> 04:00.308
Hah, we are
so getting promotion.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.476
Hah, what luck, they left.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.945
Except all the Vermillion
forces in the swamp

04:04.978 --> 04:08.782
are apparently headed to
the same place we are, the dome.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.286
- I didn't say, what, good luck.
- So what do we do?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.955
We're in deep trouble
the moment they spot us.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.625
Then let's make sure they don't.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.692
[intense music]

04:18.726 --> 04:20.628
Uh-ha, gotta give
whoever named it

04:20.661 --> 04:22.963
the Boiling Sea
credit for accuracy.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.599
Kai, Nya, I am sorry.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.068
We never expected
anyone ever to return

04:28.101 --> 04:30.371
least of all, our children.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.640
But only the masters
of fire and water

04:32.673 --> 04:34.675
working together,
can traverse it.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.844
Your journey
will be fraught with peril

04:36.877 --> 04:38.979
traps, enormous obstacles

04:39.012 --> 04:40.781
'and geo-atomic rock monsters.'

04:40.814 --> 04:42.816
And you will
need the Dragon Blade.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.353
- Allow me.
- What! What are you doing?

04:45.386 --> 04:48.389
I knew it!
This is a Ninja trick.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.090
[grunting]

04:50.123 --> 04:51.959
[groans]

04:51.992 --> 04:53.927
It is the key to successfully

04:53.961 --> 04:55.796
getting you the Reversal Blade.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.064
It's one weapon.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.099
We still have three Time Blades.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.002
I suppose escape is impossible.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.372
Although I'd love
for them to try.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.740
Machia, release the sword.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.078
Now, you must use it
to create the Fusion Dragon.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.112
The what?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.647
Only a Fusion Dragon

05:13.681 --> 05:15.783
can plunge the depths
of the Boiling Sea

05:15.816 --> 05:18.719
and only the Dragon Blade
can create one.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.455
You will make
the impossible, possible.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.524
And unify the elemental powers

05:23.557 --> 05:25.959
of fire and water.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.061
[dramatic music]

05:28.095 --> 05:29.797
[grunts]

05:35.969 --> 05:37.771
The Fusion Dragon.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.807
[roars]

05:39.840 --> 05:42.476
Now, when you reach
the first obstacle, you must--

05:42.510 --> 05:44.578
No time, Wu's wasting away.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.146
We'll just figure it out
as we go.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.381
[grunts]

05:47.415 --> 05:48.716
[roars]

05:48.749 --> 05:51.084
He can be a little hot headed.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.621
He gets that from his father.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.889
[roars]

05:55.923 --> 05:59.627
Remember...work together.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.596
[screaming]

06:06.166 --> 06:07.501
swoosh

06:08.436 --> 06:11.539
[screaming]

06:17.845 --> 06:20.681
[music continues]

06:20.714 --> 06:21.949
swoosh

06:31.525 --> 06:33.160
[gasping]

06:33.193 --> 06:34.495
(Nya)
'I didn't know how much longer'

06:34.528 --> 06:36.630
'I could hold my breath.'

06:36.664 --> 06:40.668
- I can't see a thing.
- The Master of Fire is on it.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.438
Nice, huh?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.807
Sometimes I don't know
what we'd do without me.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.041
[screams]

06:48.075 --> 06:49.777
[grunts]

06:49.810 --> 06:53.413
Who knew you could be
this high up under the sea?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.784
(Kai)
That little dot
down there must be

06:56.817 --> 06:58.952
the lost library of Hono Mizu.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.522
Any idea how to reach it
without breaking our necks?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.557
Well, we could ask our dad.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.692
Oh, no, wait.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.628
You were too impatient for that.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.598
Hang on. I have an idea.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.900
We slide down this.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.001
[intense music]

07:14.034 --> 07:15.836
What? We'll be torn to shreds.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.139
Which is where
my power comes in. Whoa!

07:19.172 --> 07:22.543
Sometimes I don't know
what you'd do without me.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.614
[whimpering]

07:32.520 --> 07:35.523
- Well, that was easy.
- Yeah, too easy.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.225
- Ow!
- On to the breach.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.594
Freedom!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.230
Stop, he's not a Vermilion.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.865
I know a snake

07:44.898 --> 07:46.634
when I see one.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.802
Ninja?

07:48.836 --> 07:50.738
You've come to rescue me.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.240
Ugh, a decision
I'm starting to regret.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.642
Now, come on, let's get you

07:54.675 --> 07:56.009
outta here
before we're discovered.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.979
Hey, Borg,
why exactly did Krux and Acronix

07:59.012 --> 08:00.113
kidnap you anyway?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.983
Duh. Pay attention, Jay,
we know why.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.019
They grabbed every builder
in Ninjago to outfit their army.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.188
Uh, no, not me.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.223
I was forced to create something

08:10.257 --> 08:12.025
far more sinister.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.761
[intense music]

08:14.962 --> 08:17.665
[laughs]
It's, uh, what is that thing?

08:17.698 --> 08:21.301
I've heard them call it
"The Iron Doom."

08:21.334 --> 08:23.637
Krux and Acronix
ultimate weapon.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.840
- And you designed it?
- Uh, no, a blacksmith did.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.042
I'm afraid
that I am responsible

08:29.076 --> 08:31.545
for...uh, that, it's a--

08:31.579 --> 08:33.747
(Nindroid)
Nano fused,
neo atomic power source

08:33.781 --> 08:35.248
which according
to my calculations

08:35.282 --> 08:37.818
creates an energy displacement
sufficient to allow for..

08:37.851 --> 08:40.554
Uh, oh-oh, dear,
temporal voyage.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.622
"Temporal voyage?"

08:41.655 --> 08:42.756
Time travel!

08:42.790 --> 08:44.958
Temporal means time. Duh!

08:44.992 --> 08:45.926
Pay attention, Cole.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.162
It harnesses the power
of the Time Blades.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.832
If Krux and Acronix get all four

08:51.865 --> 08:55.068
they will be able to take
all these Vermilion warriors

08:55.102 --> 08:57.137
anywhere in time.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.072
[screaming]

08:59.106 --> 09:00.207
[grunts]

09:00.240 --> 09:01.575
[laughs]

09:03.944 --> 09:05.679
(Nya)
'As deadly obstacles go'

09:05.713 --> 09:07.915
that was pretty fun.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.651
I'm starting to think
mom overstated the danger.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.219
[laughs]
You know how moms can get.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.022
No, I never knew one 'cause..

09:15.055 --> 09:18.325
'Cause ours got kidnapped
when you were only three.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.961
Right, sorry.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.231
Uh, my point was, moms like
to worry about everything

09:24.264 --> 09:26.066
but this is nothing.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.335
All that's left is a climb
over some boulders and..

09:28.368 --> 09:30.671
[growling]

09:31.872 --> 09:34.975
Hang on, those aren't boulders.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.009
Those are..

09:36.043 --> 09:37.044
[roars]

09:37.077 --> 09:38.045
What did mom call them?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.814
Geo-atomic rock monsters!

09:40.848 --> 09:43.216
She understated the danger! No!

09:43.250 --> 09:45.686
[roaring]

09:45.719 --> 09:47.187
(Jay)
Krux and Acronix
are gonna travel

09:47.220 --> 09:48.689
back in time in that thing?

09:48.722 --> 09:51.058
We gotta stop it!

09:51.091 --> 09:52.192
Uh-how do we stop it?

09:52.225 --> 09:53.326
During assembly

09:53.360 --> 09:54.762
I programmed in

09:54.795 --> 09:57.831
a secret back door
self destruct code

09:57.865 --> 10:01.068
but, eh, they watched me
like a hawk as I built it

10:01.101 --> 10:03.971
so I never got
a chance to enter the code.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.338
Then we'll just
have to sneak down

10:05.372 --> 10:07.074
and type in the code ourselves.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.943
Sneak into Vermilion
warrior central?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.780
- Are you nuts, Lloyd?
- You guys have a better plan?

10:12.813 --> 10:15.082
'One that doesn't allow
Krux and Acronix'

10:15.115 --> 10:15.983
to time travel off to

10:16.016 --> 10:18.719
who knows when to do,
who knows what?

10:18.752 --> 10:22.189
- Uh, we do not.
- We just need the code.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.357
Ah, uh, yes, o-of course.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.860
It's, um, uh..

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
- Oh, I don't remember.
- What?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.964
I-I know it's a long sequence

10:30.998 --> 10:34.334
so, I committed it to the deep
recesses of my brain.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.269
Eh, perhaps if I see the panel

10:36.303 --> 10:39.840
it would draw the numbers
to the front of my brain.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.408
Looks like
you're coming with us.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.744
Going somewhere?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.881
He said
"Going somewhere, egghead?"

10:47.915 --> 10:49.917
Oh, I-I didn't say
the egghead part

10:49.950 --> 10:51.284
but-but that's a nice touch.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.753
Uh, yes. Um..

10:52.786 --> 10:54.154
I-I was hoping to inspect

10:54.187 --> 10:56.690
my apparatus
on the factory floor.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.426
Why exactly? To sabotage it?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.328
No, on the contrary, uh

11:01.361 --> 11:03.263
to ensure
it's properly installed.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.867
Why, imagine what Krux
and Acronix would do to me

11:06.900 --> 11:09.870
and you, if it doesn't work.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.773
Uh, good point.
W-we should let him inspect it.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.776
I asked these gentlemen
to escort me down

11:15.809 --> 11:18.011
but, uh, they didn't respond.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.181
Of course not, you can't
control the hive mind.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.885
Vermilion,
take him to the Iron Doom.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.963
- Aye-aye.
- What? Did you just speak?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.164
No.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.399
Okay, that time I did.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.567
Vermilion, attack.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.303
Wait, wait, do you mean
us Vermilion or.. Aah!

11:43.336 --> 11:45.072
Seriously, Jay? We're Ninja.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.439
we're supposed to be stealth--

11:46.473 --> 11:48.308
Oh, I'm way past stealthy.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.342
[hissing]

11:49.376 --> 11:52.212

11:57.384 --> 11:58.819
Cornered again?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.487
- You know, this gets old.
- Hang on.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.389
- Do you hear that?
- What?

12:02.422 --> 12:03.991
vroom

12:07.160 --> 12:08.161
Samurai X?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.429
I said, attack!

12:09.462 --> 12:11.965
Go, go, go!

12:11.999 --> 12:14.534
Cyrus Borg,
I am relieved you are safe.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.237
- I have been looking for you.
- But how did you find me?

12:17.270 --> 12:20.007
I was able to
hack into Zane's scanner.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.776
He located you and I came.

12:25.545 --> 12:29.149
Samurai X, you appear to always
show up at just the right time.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.052
You could say I'm hardwired
that way, Nindroid.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.887
Now, lets get you home.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.957
No, we need him
to disable the Iron Doom.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.525
Challenge accepted.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.460
[engine revving]

12:40.493 --> 12:42.129

12:42.162 --> 12:43.363

[grunting]

12:46.900 --> 12:49.002
[screaming]

12:50.503 --> 12:52.339
I'll take care of this.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.473
Go!

12:53.506 --> 12:55.008

12:55.042 --> 12:56.509

[growls]

12:58.278 --> 12:59.279
[grunts]

12:59.312 --> 13:00.113
So, apparently

13:00.147 --> 13:02.883
geo-atomic rock monsters
are fireproof.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.153
[grunts]
And waterproof.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.355
Put me down!

13:08.388 --> 13:09.522
You heard my sister

13:09.556 --> 13:10.557
put her down!

13:10.590 --> 13:12.893
[roaring]

13:14.928 --> 13:17.530
Kai, fire and water combined.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.499
The steam is cracking him.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.334
[roars]

13:21.368 --> 13:22.870

13:22.903 --> 13:25.138

we work together.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.139

13:27.207 --> 13:28.608

13:28.641 --> 13:30.110

13:46.459 --> 13:49.396
[intense music]

13:55.035 --> 13:57.337
Amazing,
gotta be dad's handy work.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.206
But I don't see a handle.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.241
How do we open
something this big?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.876
By working together.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.411
Fire!

14:04.444 --> 14:06.313
Water!

14:10.350 --> 14:11.618
Working together.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.187
[laughs]

14:14.221 --> 14:16.123

14:16.156 --> 14:17.157

[groans]

14:22.395 --> 14:23.630
[grunts]

14:23.663 --> 14:26.299
No! Ah! We came so far.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.369
Uh, we used our fire
and water power together.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.038
'We did everything right!'

14:31.071 --> 14:33.240
'Why would dad build
a door that doesn't open?'

14:33.273 --> 14:35.008
[gasps]
The Dragon Blade!

14:35.042 --> 14:37.477
Our parents said
it's the key to our success

14:37.510 --> 14:39.980
and the key to retrieving
the Time Blade.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.115
For once, take two seconds

14:42.149 --> 14:44.051
to think a problem through.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.588
- I think it's the literal key.
- Dad's blacksmith stamp.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.057
[grunts]

14:50.958 --> 14:52.359
Both of us.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.301
[door creaks]

15:04.104 --> 15:06.006
Oh, the Reversal Blade.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.208
- We did it!
- Okay, but, be careful.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.410
[whirring]

15:10.443 --> 15:11.678
There maybe one final..

15:11.711 --> 15:13.380
[rumbling]

15:14.281 --> 15:15.515
..trap!

15:15.548 --> 15:18.618
You think maybe we were
supposed to do that together?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.587
Like everything else?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.555
We gotta bolt
or do you wanna stay

15:22.589 --> 15:24.424
and think the problem through?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.494
The Fusion Dragon.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.362
whoosh

15:31.598 --> 15:33.300

15:45.412 --> 15:48.481

- Keep fighting!

15:48.515 --> 15:49.516
[grunts]

15:49.549 --> 15:50.550
We gotta hold them back

15:50.583 --> 15:52.052
long enough for Samurai X

15:52.085 --> 15:54.254
'to get Cyrus Borg
to the panel.'

15:54.287 --> 15:56.456
The control panel is there.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.159
vroom

16:00.793 --> 16:03.496
I hope you have
no fear of heights.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.998

What?

16:05.032 --> 16:07.134

16:08.635 --> 16:10.570
Air team, intercept.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.476

16:34.794 --> 16:37.097
Uh, let's see, I-I know the code

16:37.130 --> 16:39.666
is a thirteen hundred
digit sequence, but..

16:39.699 --> 16:41.634
Oh, um..

16:41.668 --> 16:43.736
How's it going up there?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.505
He needs more time!

16:45.538 --> 16:47.774
[grunting]

16:47.807 --> 16:49.242
(Krux)
'Where are they?'

16:49.276 --> 16:51.578
What if they fail,
then what do we do?

16:51.611 --> 16:54.547
[growling]

16:55.615 --> 16:58.585
The children, they're safe.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.420
But did they get the Time Blade?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.658
[growls]

17:05.692 --> 17:07.194
Master Wu.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.230
- Are we too late?
- Kai, uh-uh, Nya?

17:10.263 --> 17:13.100
Yes and we're gonna save you.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.368
- Actually, you're not.
- What?

17:15.402 --> 17:16.803
You promised if we retrieve

17:16.836 --> 17:18.438
the Time Blade
we could help him.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.273
Yeah, about that

17:20.307 --> 17:21.274
we lied.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.575
Did you really think

17:22.609 --> 17:24.544
we would allow Wu to remain

17:24.577 --> 17:27.480
after all the trouble
he's caused us over the years?

17:27.514 --> 17:28.815
You monsters!

[grunting]

17:33.353 --> 17:35.054

17:35.788 --> 17:38.125
The blade is mine, boy.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.826
Yeah? Well, here it comes.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.161

- Not this time.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.846
Slow down, kid.

Oh..

18:27.340 --> 18:29.742
He just caught me off guard.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.110
Get them!

18:32.179 --> 18:33.313
[groans]

18:34.581 --> 18:37.584
Excellent work, brother.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.619
Four completes the set.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.755
So, now it's time
to return to the swamp.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.756
What about them?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.625
Let's drop them off here.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.227
Supreme Commander Machia.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.129
- Make it so.

Got ya. It's not
too late to save Master Wu

19:18.425 --> 19:20.560
but we still
need the Reversal Blade.

Anytime, guys.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.711
It's a thirteen hundred

19:38.745 --> 19:41.481
- There's something in--
- Thirteen hundred?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.483
That's the
exact number of digits

19:43.516 --> 19:44.817
in the first line of code--

19:44.851 --> 19:46.253
Programming a Nindroid.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.502
- Nine, two, one, five, six.
- Guys!

20:02.535 --> 20:04.971
Just a few hundred more digits.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.407
What! Could this get any harder?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.442
Oh, you didn't
just ask that, did you?

20:09.476 --> 20:11.010
You just totally jinxed us.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.713
Come on,
that's not how life works.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.357
What is that Ninja
doing with Borg?

20:24.391 --> 20:26.959
I think they're trying
to shut down the Iron Doom

20:26.993 --> 20:28.861
'before it ever becomes
operational.'

20:28.895 --> 20:30.830
We'll take care of them.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.699
Machia, proceed as planned.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.301

20:36.002 --> 20:38.605
Vermilion, to the Iron Doom.

operation Return and Repeat.

Huh? Uh-uh..

20:48.381 --> 20:50.283
Why'd they stop fighting?

20:50.317 --> 20:51.684
What's going on?

20:53.386 --> 20:57.357
And so operation
Return and Repeat begins.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.258
Huh, good name, too.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.366
creaks

21:06.399 --> 21:07.400
Eight, four, seven,

21:07.434 --> 21:09.636
two, one and..

21:09.669 --> 21:10.903
Zero.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.840
As in, zero chance of success.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.377
[whirring]

21:17.410 --> 21:20.713
Time is wasting, come, brother.

21:20.747 --> 21:21.714
[grunts]

21:23.783 --> 21:25.051
No!

21:25.084 --> 21:26.853
Yeah, I talked, come on.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.956
(all)
Ninja-a-a-go!

21:29.989 --> 21:31.524
[grunting]

21:32.425 --> 21:34.527
[music continues]

21:35.395 --> 21:38.498

21:48.841 --> 21:50.810
[rumbling]

21:53.580 --> 21:56.048
Just a few more moments,
brother.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.951
Soon, Ninjago will be ours.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.087
Nothing can stop us now.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.955
Look!

22:02.989 --> 22:05.825
Why did you have to say that?

22:05.858 --> 22:08.728
They're too far, the Dragon
can't get enough speed.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.498
- Good luck, kids.
- Mom, what are you doing?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.833
Giving you both,
the speed you need.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.836
[intense music]

22:18.571 --> 22:20.440
Okay, our mom, totally awesome.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.842
I just hope we see her again.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.911
Control time.

22:24.944 --> 22:28.047
Control everything.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.549

22:31.718 --> 22:32.985
Children?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.120
Nya?

22:34.153 --> 22:36.523
Kai? Where did they go?

22:36.556 --> 22:39.692
More like, when did they go?

22:41.428 --> 22:44.531
