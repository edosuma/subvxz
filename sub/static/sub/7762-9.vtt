01:49.277 --> 01:51.512

01:51.545 --> 01:53.347
- OH, YEAH.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.416
[doorbell rings]

01:55.449 --> 01:56.550
- OH!

01:58.319 --> 02:00.188
- HELLO, SIR.
I'M CHARLOTTE

02:00.221 --> 02:01.889
AND THIS IS AMANDA,
AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO YOU

02:01.922 --> 02:03.624
ABOUT PROPOSITION 14.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.925
ARE YOU AWARE OF IT?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.760
- YES, I'M AWARE OF IT.
- GOOD.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.230
THEN WE NEEDN'T TELL YOU
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THESE DAYS

02:09.263 --> 02:11.265
TO PROTECT THE HOLY BONDS
OF MATRIMONY,

02:11.299 --> 02:12.633
AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.535
- ISN'T THAT THE
GOD'S-HONEST TRUTH?

02:14.568 --> 02:15.536
- ARE YOU MARRIED?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.537
- I MOST CERTAINLY AM.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.938
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.907
WE'D LOVE TO SPEAK
WITH YOU AND YOUR WIFE.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.910
- HONEY, THERE ARE SOME
VERY SWEET LADIES HERE

02:22.943 --> 02:26.314
URGING US TO SUPPORT
PROPOSITION 14.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.315
- DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.916
- A SON AND A DAUGHTER.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.651
- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.186
- GOOD AFTERNOON,
LADIES.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.787
- THIS IS MY LAWFULLY
WEDDED HUSBAND.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.525
- AND THIS IS MY
LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.527
AND WE ARE GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER

02:39.560 --> 02:42.330
TO DEFEAT
PROPOSITION 14.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.431
- I SEE.
- OKAY.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.266
- WELL, GOOD
AFTERNOON THEN.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.567
- HEY, THANKS FOR
STOPPING BY.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.568
- WE'LL BE SURE TO VOTE.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.571
- BYE-BYE.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.946
- I CAUGHT THAT.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.414
- CAUGHT WHAT?

03:00.448 --> 03:01.849
- THAT SUBTLE EXCHANGE
OF SMILES

03:01.882 --> 03:03.717
THAT CAN INDICATE
ONLY ONE THING:

03:03.751 --> 03:06.687
"IS YOUR ASS
AS SORE AS MINE?"

03:06.720 --> 03:08.356
- FUCKING CHRIST,
THEODORE,

03:08.389 --> 03:09.957
IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS BURG
YOU HAVEN'T BONED

03:09.990 --> 03:11.759
SINCE YOUR
EXTREME MAKE-OVER?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.427
- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THAT

03:13.461 --> 03:15.229
IF THEY DON'T GET
A FRESH SUPPLY IN SOON,

03:15.263 --> 03:17.765
I'LL BE FORCED TO
MOVE TO PHILADELPHIA.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.901
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
USED TO WONDER

03:20.934 --> 03:23.471
WHAT IT'D BE LIKE TO
HAVE ANY GUY I WANTED.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.705
NOW I KNOW.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.474
- AND?

03:26.507 --> 03:30.478
- AND IT'S, UH, GREAT.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.581
HEY, LOOK WHO
IT IS. MICHAEL.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.848
- HEY, TEDDY.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.016
HEY, EM.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.253
- HI, SWEETIE.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.488
- WELL, IF YOU BOYS
WILL EXCUSE ME,

03:40.521 --> 03:43.223
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.229
- YEAH, I GOT TO GET
BACK TO THE STORE.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.866
- BUSY DAY?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.402
- YEAH. THIS COMIC BOOK
COLLECTION

03:54.435 --> 03:56.036
I BOUGHT OFF EBAY
JUST ARRIVED.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.606
IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME WEEKS
TO INSPECT AND GRADE THEM.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.808
- WELL, BETTER HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.775
WHAT'LL IT BE?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.544
- I THINK I'LL HAVE...

04:03.577 --> 04:04.678
- ARE YOU AND BRIAN
NEVER GOING

04:04.712 --> 04:06.280
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AGAIN?

04:06.314 --> 04:07.881
- MA...
- MICHAEL,

04:07.915 --> 04:11.018
YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS, BROTHERS,
SINCE YOU WERE KIDS.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.754
YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.657
YOU GOING TO LET A LIFETIME,
A FUCKING HISTORY,

04:16.690 --> 04:19.293
GO DOWN THE DRAIN 'CAUSE
OF SOME CHILDISH DISAGREEMENT?

04:19.327 --> 04:22.029
AND BELIEVE ME, I KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.431
- IT'S NOT CHILDISH.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.367
AND IT'S NOT JUST
A DISAGREEMENT.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.801
HE DISRESPECTS EVERY CHOICE
I'VE MADE.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.638
HE MOCKS ME FOR WANTING
A FAMILY AND A HOME.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.373
HE CALLS ME A DEFECTOR.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.575
HE EVEN BLAMES ME FOR HIS
AND JUSTIN'S BREAK-UP.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.511
HE SAYS I INFECTED HIM.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.779
WELL, HE CAN THINK
WHATEVER HE WANTS,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.581
AND CALL ME
WHATEVER HE PLEASES.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.684
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
ANYMORE.

04:43.717 --> 04:47.054
I'LL HAVE THE TUNA FISH
ON WHOLE WHEAT WITH A LEMON BAR.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.557
HOLD THE REMARKS.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.093
- WE'RE GOING
DOOR-TO-DOOR TODAY

04:53.126 --> 04:54.395
TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE
TO LISTEN.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.397
A LOT OF THEM
MAY NOT WANT TO,

04:56.430 --> 04:57.665
SO DON'T BE DISCOURAGED

04:57.698 --> 04:59.066
IF YOU GET DOORS SLAMMED
IN YOUR FACE.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.768
JUST BE COURTEOUS,

05:00.801 --> 05:01.969
MAKE YOUR POINT
SUCCINCTLY,

05:02.002 --> 05:04.938
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT ENGAGE.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.440
- THAT MEANS DON'T LOSE
YOUR FUCKING TEMPER

05:06.474 --> 05:07.841
AND SHOOT OFF
YOUR BIG MOUTH.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.843
- [chuckles]
EXACTLY. GOOD LUCK.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.347
- READY?
- YEAH.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.948
I HOPE THEY DON'T
COME OUT SWINGING,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.950
NOT WITH THE FORTUNE
I JUST SPENT ON MY FACE.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.886
- AH, AND WHAT A LOVELY FACE
IT IS TOO.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.821
YOU MUST GET
LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.356
- I'M GETTING
MORE THAN THAT.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.825
HEH-HEH-HEH.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.894
BUT TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.496
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
- LOVE, COMMITMENT?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.499
- YEAH, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.966
- WHAT YOU NEED'S A HUSBAND.
- [scoffs]

05:33.000 --> 05:35.969
FIRST I NEED A BOYFRIEND.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.038
BUT WHAT WON'T BE EASY.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.973
MY STANDARDS ARE
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.710
I WANT SOMEONE WHO'S
FINANCIALLY SECURE,

05:42.743 --> 05:44.612
WITH A FACE
LIKE BRAD PITT,

05:44.645 --> 05:45.913
A BODY LIKE BRAD PITT,

05:45.946 --> 05:48.716
AND HUNG LIKE...
WELL, JUST HUNG.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.651
- THAT'S NOT SO RIDICULOUS.
THAT'S ABSURD.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.586
LISTEN, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO GET HITCHED,

05:52.620 --> 05:53.987
WHAT YOU NEED'S
A JEWISH GUY.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.155
THEY MAKE THE BEST
MARRIAGE MATERIAL.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.790
- THEY DO?
- YEAH, PROVIDED YOU CAN

05:56.824 --> 05:58.926
GET PAST THE INCESTUOUS
RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE

05:58.959 --> 06:02.663
WITH THEIR MOTHERS THAT LASTS
BEYOND THE GRAVE.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.398
- GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.866
WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT PROPOSITION 14.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.168
WE'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE
OF YOUR TIME.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.539
- OR LESS.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.741
WELL, IT MAY NOT BE EASY,

06:13.774 --> 06:16.176
BUT AT LEAST IT GETS YOU
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.878
- THAT'S WHAT
MICHAEL SAID:

06:17.911 --> 06:20.748
KEEPING BUSY WOULD TAKE
MY MIND OFF HUNTER.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.082
SO FAR IT HASN'T HELPED.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.418
- GIVE IT TIME.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.186
- HOW MUCH TIME?
A LIFETIME?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.521
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG
IT'S GOING TO TAKE

06:27.555 --> 06:30.524
FOR ME TO FORGET ABOUT HIM.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.929
- OH, UH, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU FOLKS?

06:35.963 --> 06:38.165
- WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT PROPOSITION 14.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.033
- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU VOTE NO.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.769
- WHY'S THAT, SON?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.904
- IF IT PASSES,
GAY MEN AND WOMEN

06:43.937 --> 06:45.939
WILL LOSE THE SAME RIGHTS
THAT OTHER AMERICANS HAVE.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.808
- AND WHO'S TO SAY
WHAT'S NEXT?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.043
THE ELDERLY COULD LOSE
THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY,

06:50.077 --> 06:52.580
WOMEN COULD LOSE THE RIGHT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.515
- I SEE YOUR POINT.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.116
YOU'VE GOT MY VOTE.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.085
- DAD?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.053
WHO'S AT THE DOOR?
- HELLO.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.590
UH, WE WERE JUST
TALKING TO YOUR FATHER

07:02.623 --> 07:05.058
ABOUT VOTING NO
FOR PROPOSITION 14.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.928
- MY FATHER HASN'T VOTED
IN TEN YEARS.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.863
HE HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.099
COME ON, DAD.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.904
- TRUST ME, JIM.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.541
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE
HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW?

07:20.574 --> 07:21.842
I'LL PLY YOU WITH MARTINIS.

07:21.875 --> 07:26.246
AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL
SEE THINGS MY WAY.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.881
OH.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.487
FELDON'S LOSING HIS HARD-ON
FOR THE NEW HOME STATION AD.

07:33.521 --> 07:37.257
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT'S A BIT SUGGESTIVE.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.994
- YOU ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT
IT'S GENIUS.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.630
- HEY LISTEN, HOW ABOUT
COMING WITH ME

07:42.663 --> 07:44.832
TO BETH EMMANUEL'S MIXER?

07:44.865 --> 07:47.868
- WHO'S SHE?
- IT'S A TEMPLE.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.103
THEY'RE HAVING THEIR MONTHLY
GAY GET-TOGETHER AT WOODY'S,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.573
AND I WANT TO
MEET A MENSCH,

07:52.606 --> 07:53.707
SETTLE DOWN.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.744
- CHRIST.
AM I THE ONLY FAG

07:56.777 --> 07:58.278
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PUT
A TROUSSEAU TOGETHER

07:58.311 --> 08:00.681
AND WALK DOWN THE AISLE?

08:00.714 --> 08:03.250
- LISTEN, I'M NOT
GETTING ANY YOUNGER.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.720
I'LL BE 35 THIS SUMMER.
- 9.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.756
- WHAT?
- 39.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.892
- I--
- I'M YOUR EMPLOYER.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.994
THERE'S A PAPER TRAIL.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.296
WHY DON'T YOU ASK JUSTIN?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.165
RUMOR HAS IT HE'S HOT
FOR A HUBBY.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.000
- JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.168
- WELL, THERE ARE
MANY UNCERTAINTIES

08:21.201 --> 08:22.870
IN THIS LIFE, THEODORE,

08:22.903 --> 08:25.639
MANY MYSTERIES
BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.274
BUT ONE THING
I KNOW FOR A FACT:

08:27.307 --> 08:30.578
I WILL NEVER BE
MRS. SEYMOUR GOLDFARB.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.018
- I WISH WE'D BEEN ABLE
TO CONVINCE MORE PEOPLE.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.654
- WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
WE KEEP ON TRYING, HUH?

08:40.688 --> 08:43.791
- YEAH.
- OH, UH--

08:45.693 --> 08:47.027
- AM I LATE?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.295
- UH, NO.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.664
WE JUST GOT HERE OURSELVES.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.767
- WHO'S HE?
- WE'LL TALK LATER.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.637
- WH--

08:56.670 --> 08:58.806
- HI.
- HI.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.849
- KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,
HONEY.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.740
- HAVE YOU SEEN A LETTER
SIGNED BY JUDGE SALTZMAN?

09:40.280 --> 09:41.882
- WONDER HOW IT GOT
INTO MY PILE?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.151
- OH, BEATS ME.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.821
- YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO SEE AN INVOICE

09:47.855 --> 09:49.890
FROM THE RESNICK GALLERY
IN NEW YORK, DID YOU?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.961
- OH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.664
MUST'VE GOTTEN MIXED UP
WITH MY STUFF BY MISTAKE.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.367
WHAT'S THIS?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.369
- OH, THAT'S A PIECE JUSTIN
HAS IN THE ART SHOW.

10:02.402 --> 10:06.239
WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.008
YOU ARE COMING TO THE OPENING,
AREN'T YOU?

10:08.041 --> 10:11.011
- ACTUALLY, I'M SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT WITH, UH--

10:11.044 --> 10:14.147
- CORINNE.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.249
MEL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HIDE IT.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.651
THAT'S OUR ARRANGEMENT:

10:17.685 --> 10:19.286
YOU HAVE YOUR LIFE,
I HAVE MINE.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.421
- I KNOW, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.724
IT'S YOUR SHOW.
- THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S MY SHOW.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.326
AND I'M INVITING YOU.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.395
AND CORINNE.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.730
- YOU SURE?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.264
- I'M FINE WITH IT.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.834
REALLY.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.807
[sighs]

10:39.840 --> 10:43.376
NOW WHAT HAVE I DONE
WITH "UNTITLED ONE AND TWO"?

10:45.913 --> 10:48.782
- IT'S RIGHT HERE,
UNDER NEWCOMBE VERSUS BUDGE.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.287
[indistinct chatter]

10:54.321 --> 10:56.323
[dog barking]

10:59.860 --> 11:02.162
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.231
- OH, A GIRAFFE.
ISN'T THAT CUTE?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.298
- IT'S A SWAN.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.837
- OH, I CAN SEE THAT...
KIND OF.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.038
- IT'S FOR MY NEXT SEGMENT.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.040
THEY WANT SOMETHING CUTE.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.174
- THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF REPORTERS

11:14.207 --> 11:15.909
CAMPED OUT, OUT FRONT.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.210
- SHIT!

11:17.244 --> 11:18.712
- AND LOOK AT THIS.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.447
THEY TOOK
AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH OF ME

11:20.480 --> 11:22.783
AND MADE IT LOOK
LIKE I'M IN BABYLON.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.317
I'VE NEVER EVEN
BEEN TO BABYLON.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.219
- YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK
THEY PUT POOR LIZA'S HEAD

11:26.253 --> 11:28.321
ON THE BODY
OF A 400-POUND WOMAN.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.824
THEN SAID SHE WAS TOO FAT
TO GET OUT OF BED.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.460
- YOU CAN'T LET THAT TRASH
GET TO YOU.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.797
BESIDES, IT'LL ALL STOP
ONCE YOU COME OUT.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.399
- YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.002
WHEN? HUH?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.203
WHERE, HONEY?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.272
- I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.841
- WELL, I SAY LARRY KING.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.744
I MEAN, IF IT WAS ME, I'D
DEFINITELY COME OUT TO LARRY.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.847
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE
HOWEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO IT,

11:53.881 --> 11:54.848
IT HAS TO BE YOUR WAY.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.216
- YEAH, DEB'S RIGHT.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.751
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.220
- OOH.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.255
YOU GOT SOME SAUCE
ON YOUR CHIN, BABY.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.991
- THAT WAS MY SWAN.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.225
- IT WAS A GIRAFFE, HONEY.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.761
[chuckles]
TRY AGAIN.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.900
YOU KNOW, I GOT ONE HELL
OF A NERVE.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.502
I'M SITTING HERE LIKE
SOME FUCKING EUNUCH

12:15.535 --> 12:17.504
MAKING ANIMALS
OUT OF NAPKINS,

12:17.537 --> 12:20.240
"TO DELIGHT THE GUESTS
AT YOUR NEXT DINNER PARTY."

12:20.273 --> 12:23.343
AND I'M TELLING YOU
HOW TO BE OUT AND PROUD.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.985
- IT'S A FUNNY STORY,
HOW WE MET.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.921
- I'M ALWAYS UP
FOR A LAUGH.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.423
- WELL, I-I WAS DROPPING MOLLY
OFF AT SCHOOL

12:36.456 --> 12:39.893
WHEN, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW,
I GET A FLAT.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.863
JUST THEN THIS MOTORCYCLE
COMES ROARING UP,

12:42.896 --> 12:45.065
AND THIS GUY DRESSED
ALL IN BLACK

12:45.098 --> 12:47.901
ASKS ME IF I WANT HELP.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.402
WELL, I HAD TAKEN
THAT NIGHT CLASS

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
IN CAR MAINTENANCE
AFTER YOUR FATHER LEFT.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.441
BUT I-I WAS ON MY WAY
TO AN OPEN HOUSE.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.444
I DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW UP
LOOKING LIKE A GREASE MONKEY...

12:57.477 --> 13:00.881
[laughs]
SO I SAID YES.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.283
AND IT TURNED
OUT TO BE TUCK.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.318
- [snorts]
"TUCK"?

13:05.352 --> 13:07.955
- IT'S SHORT FOR TUCKER.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.058
HE TEACHES EIGHTH GRADE SCIENCE
AT MOLLY'S SCHOOL.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.094
- WOW. MY SIDES
ARE SPLITTING.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.466
- SO WE GOT TO CHATTING,

13:19.499 --> 13:21.168
HE ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO GO OUT

13:21.201 --> 13:24.171
SOME NIGHT FOR A COFFEE.
- COFFEE?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.908
AREN'T HIS PARENTS AFRAID
IT MIGHT STUNT HIS GROWTH?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.910
- DO YOU WANT
TO HEAR THIS OR NOT?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.912
- [clears throat]

13:31.945 --> 13:34.915
- WELL, I FIGURED,
"WHAT THE HELL?"

13:34.948 --> 13:38.986
BEATS SITTING AT HOME READING
"HOW TO SURVIVE A DIVORCE,"

13:39.019 --> 13:41.054
SO I SAID YES.

13:41.088 --> 13:45.092
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.261
- FOR HIM MODERN,
FOR YOU ANCIENT.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.863
- I TAKE IT YOU
DON'T APPROVE.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.464
- [sighs]
I SUPPOSE A WOMAN OF YOUR AGE

13:51.498 --> 13:54.067
IS ALLOWED TO HAVE
A LITTLE FLING,

13:54.101 --> 13:56.603
PROVIDED IT'S DISCREET.

13:56.636 --> 14:00.073
- WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S--

14:00.107 --> 14:01.875
IT'S MORE THAN
A LITTLE FLING.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.511
WE'VE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER
FOR SIX MONTHS.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.479
- FOR SIX MONTHS?

14:06.513 --> 14:09.950
AND YOU NEVER
SAID ANYTHING?

14:09.983 --> 14:13.520
- WHAT WAS THE POINT,
UNTIL I WAS SURE IT WAS SERIOUS?

14:13.553 --> 14:15.488
- SERIOUS?
YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.291
HE'S 1/3 YOUR AGE.
- HALF.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.393
- FINE, HALF.
HE'S HALF YOUR AGE.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.963
HE'S STILL YOUNG
ENOUGH TO BE YOUR S--

14:22.996 --> 14:25.098
I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO SAY IT.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.568
- AND I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.370
ESPECIALLY FROM YOU.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.872
- IT'S THE TRUTH.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.512
[jazz music]

14:39.546 --> 14:43.316
[knock at door]

14:43.350 --> 14:46.086
[clears throat]

14:52.159 --> 14:55.695
[coughs]

14:55.728 --> 14:58.531
- YOU ALONE?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.001
- ONE OF THOSE RARE,
UNEXPECTED MOMENTS.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.171
- AH.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.673
- SO MUCH FOR THE MOMENT.

15:06.706 --> 15:10.677
- THAT THELONIOUS?

15:10.710 --> 15:13.947
- THAT, UH, TUNA-MACARONI
CASSEROLE?

15:13.981 --> 15:16.149
- YOU GOT IT.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.418
- DON'T WANT IT.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.420
TUNA CASSEROLE MEANS THAT
WE'RE GOING TO GET STONED

15:20.453 --> 15:23.623
AND HAVE A VERY
MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.358
UNFORTUNATELY,

15:25.392 --> 15:27.427
I JUST FINISHED
MY LAST JOINT.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.630
- WELL, FORTUNATELY...

15:30.663 --> 15:33.600
I BROUGHT ONE WITH ME.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.617
- DOES DETECTIVE HORVATH KNOW

15:50.650 --> 15:53.320
THAT HIS BLUSHING BRIDE
IS A POTHEAD?

15:53.353 --> 15:55.355
- [chuckles]

15:55.388 --> 15:57.357
NOTHING KILLS A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP FASTER

15:57.390 --> 16:00.193
THAN FULL DISCLOSURE.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.629
- GIVE ME SOME OF THAT.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.639
- I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN TREATING MICHAEL.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.642
- BUTT THE FUCK OUT.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.480
- YOU'VE BEEN ON HIS CASE
EVER SINCE

16:20.513 --> 16:22.382
HE AND BEN
BOUGHT THAT HOUSE TOGETHER.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.252
- HE DIDN'T JUST
BUY A HOUSE.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.623
HE BOUGHT THE SLICER
AND THE DICER,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.359
THE GINZU KNIVES,
THE ABS-ROLLER,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.427
THE JUICER.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.163
THE TOP HUNDRED HITS
OF THE '60s,

16:36.196 --> 16:39.532
NOT AVAILABLE
AT ANY STORE.

16:39.566 --> 16:44.104
IN SHORT, EVERY
LIE, EVERY CON...

16:44.137 --> 16:48.541
EVERY COLOR,
SHAPE AND SIZE OF BULLSHIT

16:48.575 --> 16:51.511
THE STRAIGHT WORLD
HAS TO OFFER.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.514
- HE FELL IN LOVE.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.217
HE GOT MARRIED.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.122
HE HAD A FAMILY.

17:02.155 --> 17:07.294
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING HE'S EVER
WANTED TO DO AS A KID.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.262
A NORMAL HOME.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.331
- [scoffs]

17:14.301 --> 17:17.170
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
SUCH A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

17:19.439 --> 17:22.142
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.177
YOU DON'T.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.483
YOUR PROBLEM IS...

17:33.186 --> 17:35.455
HE LEFT YOU.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.494
HE LEFT YOU,
AND HE MOVED ON.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.835
ONLY HE DIDN'T.

17:48.868 --> 17:53.206
YOU AND HE JUST MADE
DIFFERENT CHOICES, THAT'S ALL.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.210
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU DON'T
STILL LOVE EACH OTHER.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.615
- HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.618
- THEN YOU TALK TO HIM.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.860
- THE MONEY BEHIND IT
IS UNBELIEVABLE.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.728
NOT JUST WEALTHY
CONSERVATIVES,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.530
BUT BIG CORPORATIONS.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.632
- UH, BEN SAYS WE SHOULD
BOYCOTT THEM.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.602
- YEAH, BEFORE THEY TAKE
THAT RIGHT AWAY FROM US TOO.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.504
SORRY TO SOUND LIKE
SUCH AN ALARMIST,

18:24.537 --> 18:26.606
BUT THESE DAYS I FEEL LIKE
I'M LIVING IN NAZI GERMANY,

18:26.639 --> 18:28.475
LIKE WE'RE THE NEW JEWS.
- OH, COME ON, MEL.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.776
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
GOING A BIT FAR?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.778
- LISTEN, MY ZAIDEH,
MY GRANDFATHER,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.213
HE USED TO TELL ME
EVERYBODY THOUGHT

18:33.246 --> 18:34.681
HE WAS NUTS
FOR LEAVING GERMANY.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.349
"OH, YOU'RE MAKING
TOO MUCH OF IT.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.751
IT'LL PASS.
THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN HERE."

18:38.785 --> 18:40.753
HE DIED AT THE AGE OF 87.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.490
THE REST OF HIS FAMILY
DIED IN THE CAMPS.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.691
- WELL, WHAT'RE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.359
PACK UP AND MOVE TO PARIS?

18:46.393 --> 18:49.496
- WELL, LAST TIME I HEARD,
THEY HAD A GAY MAYOR.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.231
LISTEN, I'M GOING
TO GRAB THIS CAB.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.400
- OKAY. OOH.
[chuckles]

18:53.433 --> 18:55.902
- OH, BYE, SWEETHEART.
- AWW, MEL.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.538
- [laughs]
I MEANT HER. YOU TOO.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.410
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO, UH...

19:13.553 --> 19:19.226
[alarm ringing]

19:28.368 --> 19:34.307
[alarm ringing]

19:59.599 --> 20:01.734
- NOTHING WAS STOLEN?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.570
- NOT THAT I CAN TELL.

20:03.603 --> 20:07.340
- ALL I CAN SAY IS,
THANK GOD NO ONE WAS HURT.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.442
- I'LL NEED YOU
TO FILE A REPORT.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.444
- THEN WHAT?
- WE'LL INVESTIGATE.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.313
BUT WITH THIS
KIND OF VANDALISM,

20:13.346 --> 20:15.582
IT'S USUALLY PRETTY DIFFICULT
TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.983
- THAT'S ALL YOU THINK IT WAS?
VANDALISM?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.851
- WELL, WHAT ELSE?
PROBABLY JUST SOME KID

20:18.885 --> 20:20.653
TRYING TO STEAL
A COMIC BOOK.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.522
- WHAT IF IT WASN'T?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.724
WHAT IF THEY WERE TRYING
TO DESTROY THAT?

20:24.757 --> 20:27.394
TWO GAY SUPERHEROES,
GETTING MARRIED.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.995
- LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING,

20:29.028 --> 20:31.731
BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF ANY HATE CRIME.

20:31.764 --> 20:32.932
- A HATE CRIME?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.502
- I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, BUT...

20:35.535 --> 20:36.936
IN ALL HONESTY,

20:36.969 --> 20:38.871
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
A BIT CARRIED AWAY.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.640
- THAT'S FUNNY.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.543
I JUST ACCUSED MEL
OF THE SAME THING.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.815
- REMEMBER, MEN,
A SMARTLY-FOLDED NAPKIN

20:48.848 --> 20:50.950
WILL ADD A TOUCH OF CLASS
TO YOUR TABLE SETTING

20:50.983 --> 20:54.287
AND BE CERTAIN TO
CHARM YOUR LADY FRIEND.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.488
AND WHO KNOWS?
AFTER DINNER,

20:55.522 --> 20:57.290
SHE MIGHT EVEN...

20:57.324 --> 21:00.760
LET YOU SHOW HER HOW
TO MAKE ONE OF THESE.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.629
I'M EMMETT HONEYCUTT,
YOUR QUEER GUY,

21:02.662 --> 21:06.399
HERE TO MAKE YOUR LIFE
MORE FABULOUS.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.401
- THANKS, QUEER GUY,
AND THAT'S THE NEWS.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.837
WE'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT 6:00.

21:10.870 --> 21:14.541
- UNTIL THEN, HOPE ALL
YOUR NEWS IS GOOD NEWS.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.709
- AND WE'RE OUT.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.580
CUTE SEGMENT, EMMETT.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.049
AND BY THE WAY, I'VE GOT
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.518
MANAGEMENT IS THINKING ABOUT
DOING A QUEER GUY SPECIAL.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.819
NOW HERE'S THE CONCEPT:

21:26.853 --> 21:28.921
YOU PREPARE AND
SERVE A GOURMET DINNER

21:28.955 --> 21:31.458
TO A HOT STRAIGHT COUPLE.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.526
- OH, PERFECT.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.928
AND AFTER, THEY CAN FUCK
WHILE I DO THE DISHES.

21:35.962 --> 21:36.996
- [laughs]

21:37.029 --> 21:38.465
- HEY, DON.
- YEAH?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.666
- YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHO
I JUST SPOKE TO.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.601
- WHO?
- DREW BOYD.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.436
HE WANTS TO GIVE ME
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

21:43.470 --> 21:45.472
ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS
THAT HE'S A FAG.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.440
- JESUS CHRIST. OUR RATINGS
ARE GONNA GO THROUGH THE ROOF.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.941
- WATCH OUT CHANNEL 7.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.111
- OH MAN, THEY'LL BE
YESTERDAY'S NEWS.

21:56.983 --> 22:02.522
[indistinct chatter]

22:12.131 --> 22:15.067
- CAN I GET A CRANBERRY JUICE
AND SPARKLING WATER?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.976
- OH.
- OH, SORRY.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.111
- IT'S OKAY.
- NO, NO, NO.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.646
I'LL HAVE YOUR
SWEATER CLEANED.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.516
- AH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE SWEATER.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.883
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER
DRINK THOUGH.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.452
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.754
UH, WHAT WERE YOU...
- DIET PEPSI.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.589
- YOU DON'T DRINK?

22:36.623 --> 22:39.459
- UH, MAYBE A GLASS OF WINE
ON OCCASION, HOLIDAYS,

22:39.492 --> 22:42.629
BUT, UH,
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.597
- UM, TED SCHMIDT.
SHALOM.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.399
- ADAM BERNSTEIN.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.368
SHALOM AND, UH,
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.739
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

22:52.772 --> 22:54.774
- WELL, I WORK
AT THIS AD AGENCY.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.175
I DO A LOT OF THINGS THERE
BUT, UH,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.144
MOSTLY, I'M AN ACCOUNTANT.
- AN ACCOUNTANT?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.679
YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER'S
AN ACCOUNTANT.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.948
MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.550
MARK BERNSTEIN?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.884
- YEAH, I THINK
I KNOW SEVERAL.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.085
[both chuckle]

23:06.118 --> 23:08.755
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- UROLOGIST.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.557
- A DOCTOR.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.193
WELL, MY MOTHER'D
BE THRILLED.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.529
SO, UH, WHAT
ELSE DO YOU DO,

23:16.563 --> 23:21.033
I MEAN, BESIDES EXAMINING
GUYS' PROSTATES?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.635
- I'M A TENNIS FREAK.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.704
I MEAN, I'VE GOT
A HELL OF A BACKHAND.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.706
- I'LL BET YOU DO.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.807
DO YOU LIKE OPERA?

23:27.840 --> 23:30.643
- NO, HATE IT.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.512
UH, BUT I LOVE BALLET--

23:32.545 --> 23:34.046
MEN IN TIGHTS.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.716
HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.718
I'VE GOT SEASON'S TICKETS.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.953
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO SOMETIME?

23:40.987 --> 23:42.922
- YOU MEAN,
A "PAS DE DEUX"?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.557
I'D LOVE TO.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.192
- BUT THEN...

23:46.225 --> 23:49.962
WHY WAIT UNTIL "GISELLE"
ROLLS INTO TOWN?

23:49.996 --> 23:51.964
- OH.

23:56.569 --> 23:59.706
- HEY, I JUST PUT ONE OF THOSE
ON THE FRONT LAWN.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.675
- YEAH, AND I JUST
TOOK IT OUT.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.677
- WHAT?

24:04.711 --> 24:06.212
- AREN'T WE DOING ENOUGH?

24:06.245 --> 24:07.614
CANVASSING AND VOLUNTEERING?

24:07.647 --> 24:09.949
DO WE REALLY NEED THIS TOO?

24:09.982 --> 24:13.019
- IT'S A SIGN OF SOLIDARITY,
SUPPORT.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.087
BESIDES, PRACTICALLY EVERYONE'S
HOUSE ON THE BLOCK HAS ONE,

24:15.121 --> 24:16.956
INCLUDING ELI AND MONTY'S.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.257
- GOOD FOR THEM.
THEY CAN ALSO

24:18.290 --> 24:20.627
WEAR PINK TRIANGLES
ON THEIR SLEEVES.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.095
- NO REASON TO GET YOURSELF
SO WORKED UP.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.732
- ACTUALLY, THERE IS.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN A TARGET.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.835
- CARL SAID THERE'S
NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.

24:28.868 --> 24:32.705
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE SHOP WAS UPSETTING.

24:32.739 --> 24:35.842
BUT LET'S TRY AND
STAY LEVEL-HEADED.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.243
- WELL, FINE.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.845
LET'S HOW LEVEL-HEADED
YOU FEEL WHEN THEY

24:38.878 --> 24:41.013
ROUND US ALL UP AND
TAKE US OFF TO THE CAMPS.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.849
- [scoffs]
ALL RIGHT.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.183
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT
ON THE FRONT LAWN,

24:44.216 --> 24:46.619
WE WON'T PUT IT
ON THE FRONT LAWN.

24:52.792 --> 24:57.163
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M BEING RIDICULOUS, BUT...

24:57.196 --> 24:58.998
I WOULD HATE FOR SOMETHING
TERRIBLE TO HAPPEN

24:59.031 --> 25:02.101
JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
PAY ATTENTION TO THE WARNINGS.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.539
- WE'LL HAVE MORE SCORES
AT 11:00. BUT RIGHT NOW,

25:06.573 --> 25:09.175
WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL GUEST
IN THE STUDIO WITH US,

25:09.208 --> 25:10.677
STAR QUARTERBACK
FOR THE IRONMEN

25:10.710 --> 25:14.146
AND TWO-TIME MVP DREW BOYD.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.215
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE, DREW.
- THANKS, BUD.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.284
- WELL, DREW, YOU'D HAVE
TO BE LIVING ON THE MOON

25:18.317 --> 25:20.887
NOT TO KNOW WHAT'S BEEN
HAPPENING WITH YOU THESE DAYS.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.890
I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE,
UH, SEX ALLEGATIONS.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.792
"BOYD LIKES BOYS."

25:25.825 --> 25:27.827
- IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT
TIME FOR ME,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.696
BUD, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.565
BUT I FEEL AS THOUGH THE SOONER
THAT I ADDRESS THIS ISSUE,

25:32.599 --> 25:34.767
THE SOONER I CAN GET ON
WITH MY LIFE.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.669
- LET ME JUST SAY THAT
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR...

25:36.703 --> 25:38.571
HOW LONG NOW?
15 YEARS?

25:38.605 --> 25:40.573
WE STARTED OUT
PLAYING BALL TOGETHER.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.808
AND I'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT OF YOU,

25:41.841 --> 25:43.910
NOT ONLY AS AN
OUTSTANDING ATHLETE,

25:43.943 --> 25:46.212
BUT AS A MAN'S MAN.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.647
SO, WHY DON'T WE PUT

25:47.680 --> 25:49.682
ALL THESE RUMORS
TO REST RIGHT NOW?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.183
- FIRST OF ALL,
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT

25:51.217 --> 25:53.786
MOST OF THOSE STORIES
ARE OUT-AND-OUT LIES,

25:53.820 --> 25:55.655
TOTAL EXAGGERATIONS.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.725
- I'M SURE THAT'S A RELIEF
FOR YOUR MILLIONS OF FANS.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.794
- BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING
ME IF I'M GAY...

26:01.828 --> 26:05.564
THE ANSWER IS YES.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.341
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.209
YOU'RE SAYING
A GUY LIKE YOU?

26:17.243 --> 26:21.013
- YEAH, A GUY LIKE ME.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.283
- AW, I-I CAN'T EVEN PICTURE
YOU KISSING ANOTHER GUY.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.085
NOT LIKE HIM.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.954
- EXCUSE ME?

26:27.987 --> 26:29.856
- ACTUALLY, BUD,

26:29.889 --> 26:33.025
IT WAS YOUR QUEER GUY,
EMMETT HONEYCUTT,

26:33.059 --> 26:34.393
WHO HELPED ME
TO FIND THE COURAGE

26:34.426 --> 26:37.263
NOT JUST TO BE
A MAN'S MAN...

26:37.296 --> 26:40.099
BUT TO BE MY OWN MAN.

26:40.132 --> 26:43.135
AND I'D LIKE TO THANK HIM.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.186
- WE'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.721
- AND WE'RE OUT.

27:01.754 --> 27:07.626
[indistinct chatter]

27:10.029 --> 27:11.397
- JUSTIN.
- YEAH?

27:11.430 --> 27:13.132
- I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
SIMON CASWELL.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.901
HE'S THE CRITIC FROM
THE "ART FORUM MAGAZINE".

27:14.934 --> 27:16.202
- HI.
- HELLO.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.904
LINDSAY'S ALWAYS
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME

27:17.937 --> 27:19.672
TO COME TO PITTSBURGH.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.174
I TELL HER,
"WARHOL'S IT"...

27:22.208 --> 27:26.178
BUT, UH, THIS TIME
I COULD BE WRONG.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.818
YOUR WORK HAS A SURPRISING
INTENSITY TO IT,

27:31.851 --> 27:33.820
ESPECIALLY FOR
SOMEONE SO YOUNG.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.287
WHAT MADE YOU WANT
TO BE AN ARTIST?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.323
- IT WAS THAT OR BE
A MASS MURDERER.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.891
[all chuckle]

27:38.925 --> 27:41.427
- THAT'S VERY AMUSING.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.029
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
- BYE.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.431
SEE YOU.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.433
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE SAID?

27:47.466 --> 27:49.035
REMEMBER THIS MOMENT.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.803
- WHAT FOR?
HE'S A CUNT.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.204
- A VERY INFLUENTIAL CUNT.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.173
- A CUNT'S A CUNT.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.908
- WELL, FROM THE WAY
EVERYONE'S TALKING,

27:55.942 --> 27:57.844
THIS MIGHT AS WELL
BE A ONE-MAN SHOW.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.179
- I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE SO TALENTED.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.081
- THANK YOU.
- UM, CORINNE,

28:02.114 --> 28:03.315
YOU REMEMBER...
- LINDSAY.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.784
I'M REALLY ENJOYING
THE SHOW.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.452
- WELL, I'M DELIGHTED
YOU COULD COME.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.221
- I NEED A REFILL.
WE'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.191
- BYE.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.926
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH ALL OF THIS?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.194
- WELL, WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DO I HAVE?

28:15.227 --> 28:19.799
- MY OTHER CAREER CHOICE.

28:19.832 --> 28:24.470
- ART OPENINGS ARE ALWAYS
SUCH GAY OCCASIONS.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.005
- ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
YOU'RE HERE.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.340
MWAH.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.475
- I WASN'T SURE YOU'D COME.

28:29.508 --> 28:32.478
- NEITHER WAS I.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.481
THAT IT?
- DO YOU LIKE IT?

28:35.514 --> 28:37.116
- IF I DID,
WOULD THAT MAKE IT GOOD?

28:37.149 --> 28:38.818
- NO.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.020
- WOULD IT MAKE YOU
LIKE IT MORE OR LESS?

28:41.053 --> 28:42.889
- NO.
- WOULD IT MAKE YOU RICH?

28:42.922 --> 28:44.290
- NO.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.926
- THEN WHY DO YOU GIVE A SHIT
WHAT I THINK?

28:49.395 --> 28:52.431
I THINK IT'S EXQUISITE.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.734
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.974
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
I FUCKED AN ARTSY TYPE.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.988
- LET ME GUESS.

29:16.022 --> 29:20.126
YOU DON'T KNOW ART,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.863
- I LIKE MAGRITTE,
CEZANNE AND JOHNS.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.865
- HMM.

29:25.898 --> 29:29.268
- I DID GO TO COLLEGE.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.337
AND I ALSO LIKE YOUR STUFF.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.874
- YOU ALSO LIKE MY MOTHER.
- YES, I DO.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.209
- DON'T YOU HAVE ONE
OF YOUR OWN?

29:39.578 --> 29:41.814
- THAT'S NOT WHY I LIKE HER.

29:41.848 --> 29:46.318
I LIKE HER
BECAUSE SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,

29:46.352 --> 29:48.420
INTELLIGENT, SEXY.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.423
- HAVE YOU FUCKED HER?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.025
- I DON'T THINK
THAT CONCERNS YOU.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.227
- AS THEY SAY,
25 GOES INTO 50

29:55.261 --> 29:57.429
A LOT MORE THAN
50 GOES INTO 25.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.566
- EXCEPT IN YOUR CASE.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.870
ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, HE'S NOT
QUITE THAT OLD, IS HE?

30:09.208 --> 30:11.243
LOOK, SHE'S AN ADULT,
SO AM I.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.945
SHE'S FREE TO LOVE
WHOEVER SHE PLEASES

30:12.979 --> 30:14.914
WITHOUT HER
CHILD'S APPROVAL.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.916
- I'M HER SON.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.184
AND I'M AN ADULT.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.887
- OKAY, THEN ACT LIKE ONE.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.458
- WHO KNEW THERE
WERE SO MANY

30:26.492 --> 30:28.127
HOT JEWISH MEN
IN THE WORLD?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.361
- JESUS CHRIST,

30:29.395 --> 30:31.097
YOU ALREADY
SOUND LIKE YENTL.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.198
- [chuckles]

30:32.231 --> 30:34.100
"DOCTOR AND MRS.
ADAM BERNSTEIN".

30:34.133 --> 30:35.201
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

30:35.234 --> 30:37.336
- MAZEL TOV.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.071
- CAN I BORROW YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

30:39.105 --> 30:40.339
- I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CONVERSATION.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.942
- YEAH WELL, THEODORE
CAN REGALE YOU

30:42.975 --> 30:45.912
WITH HIS TALES OF
THE YESHIVA LATER.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.617
- WHAT IS IT?

30:51.650 --> 30:52.985
- I JUST WANTED
YOU TO KNOW

30:53.019 --> 30:55.621
THAT IF IT
MAKES YOU HAPPY

30:55.654 --> 30:57.156
BEING A STEPFORD FAG,

30:57.189 --> 31:02.128
THEN I SAY GO FOR IT.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.096
BE THE BIGGEST STEPFORD FAG
IN THE WORLD.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.065
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

31:08.935 --> 31:12.271
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE, AN APOLOGY?

31:12.304 --> 31:13.973
- I MEAN IT.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.308
- AREN'T YOU AFRAID
I'M GOING TO INFECT YOU?

31:19.211 --> 31:21.280
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE WE'VE
BEEN FRIENDS OUR WHOLE LIVES

31:21.313 --> 31:24.283
DOESN'T MEAN WE
HAVE TO STAY FRIENDS.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.320
ESPECIALLY SINCE...

31:28.354 --> 31:32.258
WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING
IN COMMON.

31:32.291 --> 31:36.395
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST ADMIT THAT
THE "BRIAN-MIKEY SHOW" IS OVER,

31:36.428 --> 31:39.165
AND GET ON WITH OUR LIVES?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.680
- SCOTCH?

31:54.713 --> 31:57.016
- WELL, I DON'T USUALLY
LIKE MY DRINKS STRAIGHT,

31:57.049 --> 32:00.019
BUT...
[chuckles]

32:00.052 --> 32:01.988
- SORRY I GOT YOU FIRED.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.156
- MM, I MAY HAVE
LOST MY JOB,

32:04.190 --> 32:06.959
BUT, UH, AFTER
OUR SCREEN KISS,

32:06.993 --> 32:08.427
AT LEAST NO ONE CAN SAY
I'M SEXLESS.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.695
- [chuckles]

32:09.728 --> 32:11.430
THANKS TO ME.

32:11.463 --> 32:15.567
- YEAH, WHATEVER
POSSESSED YOU?

32:15.601 --> 32:17.203
- [sighs]

32:17.236 --> 32:19.338
IT'S THE FIRST
RULE OF THE GAME:

32:19.371 --> 32:20.973
ALWAYS PROTECT
YOUR TEAMMATES.

32:21.007 --> 32:24.043
AND SINCE WE NOW PLAY
FOR THE SAME TEAM,

32:24.076 --> 32:27.079
I WAS COVERING YOUR ASS.

32:27.113 --> 32:31.383
AND PAYING BACK
RAYMOND OSWALD.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.985
HE WAS THIS KID
IN HIGH SCHOOL--

32:33.019 --> 32:34.987
EFFEMINATE, TOTAL FAG.

32:35.021 --> 32:38.190
- I KNOW THE TYPE.

32:38.224 --> 32:42.194
- MY BUDDIES AND I MADE
HIS LIFE MISERABLE.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.363
TAUNTED HIM.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.465
BEAT HIM UNTIL HE CRIED.

32:46.498 --> 32:50.136
HE FINALLY TRANSFERRED
TO ANOTHER SCHOOL.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.538
I ALWAYS FELT...

32:52.571 --> 32:55.007
AWFUL...

32:55.041 --> 32:57.776
FOR WHAT I DID TO HIM...

32:57.809 --> 33:00.246
BECAUSE SECRETLY,
I KNEW...

33:00.279 --> 33:01.513
EVEN THOUGH
HE AND I MAY HAVE

33:01.547 --> 33:03.382
BEEN DIFFERENT
ON THE OUTSIDE...

33:03.415 --> 33:07.219
ON THE INSIDE,
WE WERE THE SAME.

33:07.253 --> 33:10.156
SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY

33:10.189 --> 33:13.392
YOU'RE MY ATONEMENT FOR
WHAT I DID TO RAYMOND OSWALD.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.066
- MY HERO.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.105
SO NOW THAT
YOU'RE FINALLY OUT,

33:26.138 --> 33:29.041
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

33:32.544 --> 33:36.248
- HORNY.

33:36.282 --> 33:39.251
[upbeat music]

33:39.285 --> 33:47.226
*

33:55.167 --> 33:58.104
- [laughs]

34:00.706 --> 34:02.674
I LOVE FOOTBALL!

34:02.708 --> 34:05.777
*

34:21.193 --> 34:22.294
- [gasps]

34:22.328 --> 34:23.829
SHIT!

34:23.862 --> 34:25.431
- DO YOU WANT TO WAKE
THE CHILDREN?

34:25.464 --> 34:27.699
- [giggles]
I'M SURE I WOKE THE DEAD.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.369
OH, YOU SCARED
THE FUCKING CRAP OUT OF ME.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.604
- SORRY.
- [sighs]

34:32.638 --> 34:35.441
WHAT'RE YOU, UH, SITTING
IN THE DARK FOR?

34:35.474 --> 34:38.377
- I FELT LIKE IT.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.363
- ANY MORE COCOA?

34:57.396 --> 35:00.599
- I JUST MADE ENOUGH FOR ME.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.334
IT'S AFTER 3:00.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.270
- YEAH, I GOT TIED UP.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.904
- SATIN OR LEATHER?

35:05.937 --> 35:08.240
- TALKING.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.345
I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN,
MAKE EXCUSES, OR APOLOGIZE.

35:13.379 --> 35:14.613
- THOSE ARE THE RULES.

35:14.646 --> 35:15.881
- THAT WE BOTH AGREED TO.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.684
- DID YOU FORGET
YOU HAD A FAMILY, HMM?

35:18.717 --> 35:19.918
- YOU'RE HERE.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.521
- I CAME HOME RIGHT
AFTER THE SHOW.

35:22.554 --> 35:25.491
- WHICH WAS GREAT, BY THE WAY.
WE BOTH ENJOYED IT.

35:25.524 --> 35:28.760
- I'M SO GLAD.

35:28.794 --> 35:33.232
- LISTEN, NEXT TIME I PROMISE
I'LL CALL, OKAY?

35:33.265 --> 35:35.401
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT
NEXT TIME.

35:35.434 --> 35:38.537
THIS WHOLE IN-HOUSE SEPARATION
ISN'T WORKING.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.672
AT LEAST NOT FOR ME.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.774
IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE
OBVIOUSLY MORE SOPHISTICATED,

35:42.808 --> 35:46.245
OR HEARTLESS, THAN I AM.

35:46.278 --> 35:50.849
- SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

35:50.882 --> 35:52.784
- THAT WE SELL THE HOUSE.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.686
GET TWO SEPARATE PLACES.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.288
- SELL THE HOUSE?

35:56.322 --> 35:57.656
- WHY SHOULD YOU LIVE HERE

35:57.689 --> 35:58.857
WHILE I'M IN
SOME CRUMMY APARTMENT?

35:58.890 --> 36:00.659
- WE'RE NOT
SELLING THE HOUSE.

36:00.692 --> 36:04.596
- THEN YOU MOVE OUT.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.932
- FINE. YOU WANT
TO SELL THE HOUSE?

36:06.965 --> 36:09.468
DIVIDE EVERYTHING UP 50-50?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.603
HOW ABOUT THIS VASE?

36:11.637 --> 36:12.971
- DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.473
- WHO'S MAKING FUN?

36:14.506 --> 36:15.541
- IT'S YOURS.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.942
- YOU SURE?

36:16.975 --> 36:19.278
I GAVE IT TO YOU,
REMEMBER?

36:19.311 --> 36:21.413
FOR ONE OF OUR
ANNIVERSARIES.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.681
- WELL, I DON'T WANT IT.
- NO?

36:22.714 --> 36:24.616
NEITHER DO I.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.419
[glass shatters]

36:27.453 --> 36:28.620
- WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

36:28.654 --> 36:32.324
- ONE LESS THING
TO WRAP AND MOVE.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.727
- THEN WHY DON'T WE
GET RID OF...THIS.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.896
- THAT'S MY MOTHER'S
DEPRESSION-WARE CANDY DISH.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.765
- IT'S ABOUT TO GET
MORE DEPRESSED.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.433
- YOU...DON'T...
GIVE IT TO ME.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.369
- HANDS OFF ME!

36:43.402 --> 36:45.237
[glass shatters]

36:45.271 --> 36:47.873
- GOD DAMN YOU!
- GOD DAMN YOU!

36:47.906 --> 36:50.942
[both grunting]

37:00.286 --> 37:03.221
- OH, YOU BITCH.

37:08.827 --> 37:13.665
[both panting]

37:34.085 --> 37:39.391
[both moaning]

37:43.862 --> 37:47.933
- [panting]

38:02.681 --> 38:04.450
- I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
THE NEXT PICASSO,

38:04.483 --> 38:07.386
THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO BE RUDE.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.388
- HOW WAS I RUDE?

38:09.421 --> 38:11.657
I ONLY ASKED HIM
A FEW QUESTIONS.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.659
- LIKE IF HE'S FUCKING ME?

38:13.692 --> 38:15.060
- MORE COFFEE?
- UH, NO, THANK YOU.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.562
- I'LL HAVE SOME.

38:16.595 --> 38:19.398
- [sighs]

38:19.431 --> 38:20.666
- THANK YOU.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.868
- WHAT KIND OF A QUESTION
WAS THAT?

38:22.901 --> 38:27.072
- I WAS MERELY LOOKING OUT
FOR YOUR BEST INTERESTS.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.940
- YOU DON'T THINK
THAT MAYBE

38:28.974 --> 38:31.410
YOU WERE FEELING
THREATENED BECAUSE

38:31.443 --> 38:32.711
THERE'S ANOTHER MAN
IN MY LIFE?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.746
- I WAS NOT
FEELING THREATENED.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.415
- HONEY,

38:36.448 --> 38:37.849
TUCKER IS THE FIRST
MAN I'VE GONE OUT WITH

38:37.883 --> 38:39.084
SINCE YOUR FATHER LEFT ME.

38:39.117 --> 38:42.554
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

38:42.588 --> 38:43.689
DON'T YOU THINK
I'M ENTITLED

38:43.722 --> 38:44.823
TO BE WITH SOMEONE?

38:44.856 --> 38:46.492
- SOMEONE APPROPRIATE.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.826
SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.561
- [laughs]

38:49.595 --> 38:51.763
THAT'S RATHER FUNNY,
COMING FROM YOU.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.466
- MOM, I WAS 17.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.101
YOU'RE...

38:56.134 --> 38:58.604
YOU'RE MY MOTHER.
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.475
- YOU KNOW...

39:03.509 --> 39:04.710
WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED SEEING BRIAN,

39:04.743 --> 39:06.712
I ADMIT I HAD TROUBLE.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.714
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.782
BUT EVENTUALLY
I REALIZED

39:10.816 --> 39:12.718
THAT IF HE
MADE YOU HAPPY,

39:12.751 --> 39:14.653
HE WAS GOOD TO YOU,

39:14.686 --> 39:18.123
THAT'S ALL THAT
REALLY MATTERED.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.625
WELL, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.360
HMM?

39:26.432 --> 39:29.668
- THIS IS NOT A TIME
FOR COMPLACENCY OR SILENCE.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.069
THE BATTLE LINES
HAVE BEEN DRAWN.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.638
AND IT'S UP TO EVERY AMERICAN
TO DECLARE

39:32.671 --> 39:34.940
WHICH SIDE THEY'RE ON:
THE SIDE THAT

39:34.973 --> 39:38.644
RECOGNIZES HOMOSEXUALITY
AS AN ACCEPTABLE LIFESTYLE,

39:38.677 --> 39:41.046
AND WANTS TO REWARD
THEIR DEVIANT BEHAVIOR

39:41.079 --> 39:42.881
BY GIVING THEM
THE MOST SACRED RIGHT

39:42.914 --> 39:45.150
THAT A MAN AND WOMAN HAVE,
THE RIGHT TO MARRY.

39:45.183 --> 39:46.818
- DO YOU HEAR
WHAT HE'S SAYING?

39:46.852 --> 39:48.954
- OR THE SIDE THAT IS DETERMINED
TO UPHOLD THE VALUES

39:48.987 --> 39:50.756
ON WHICH THIS GREAT
CHRISTIAN COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED...

39:50.789 --> 39:52.658
- WHEN DID IT BECOME
A "CHRISTIAN COUNTRY"?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.660
- AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.495
- WHY DO THEY ALWAYS MAKE IT
ABOUT FAMILY AND CHILDREN,

39:56.528 --> 39:58.564
LIKE GAY PEOPLE DON'T
HAVE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN TOO?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.433
SOMEBODY SHOULD PUNCH
HIS FUCKING LIGHTS OUT.

40:01.467 --> 40:03.535
- THAT'S NOT HOW
WE GET OUR MESSAGE ACROSS,

40:03.569 --> 40:05.871
BY STARTING FIGHTS.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.842
- PLEASE VOTE
FOR PROPOSITION 14.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.080
- I HAVE THIS THING
FOR SZECHUAN BEEF.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.983
- OH, ME TOO.
LOVE IT.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.685
CAN'T GET
ENOUGH OF IT.

40:19.718 --> 40:22.954
- YEAH, WHAT ELSE CAN'T YOU
GET ENOUGH OF?

40:29.961 --> 40:32.564
- THAT.

40:32.598 --> 40:33.932
- YOU KNOW, I NEVER
PUT TOO MUCH STOCK

40:33.965 --> 40:36.535
IN THOSE MIXERS AT WOODY'S.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.069
I MAINLY WENT TO CONFIRM
MY CONVICTION

40:38.103 --> 40:39.838
THAT NOTHING WOULD
EVER COME OF IT.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.941
- [laughs]
THAT IS SO PESSIMISTIC.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.476
- WELL, IT'S NOT
PESSIMISTIC.

40:44.510 --> 40:45.811
IT'S, UH, IT'S JEWISH.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.212
- AH.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.949
- BUT THIS TIME
IT WORKED OUT.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.018
- FOR ME, TOO.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.689
- YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

40:57.723 --> 40:59.090
- DO I EVER HAVE SEX
ON THE FIRST DATE?

40:59.124 --> 41:00.826
- HMM, HOW'D YOU GUESS?

41:00.859 --> 41:02.561
- AH, DEPENDS HOW IT GOES.

41:02.594 --> 41:05.463
- AND HOW WOULD YOU SAY
THIS IS GOING?

41:11.770 --> 41:13.905
- OH-H.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.788
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
DOWN THERE?

41:29.821 --> 41:32.524
- FRANKLY, NO.

41:32.558 --> 41:34.526
- WHAT'S WRONG?

41:34.560 --> 41:35.927
- YOU'RE NOT JEWISH.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.996
- I NEVER SAID I WAS.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.731
- BUT YOU WERE
AT THE MIXER.

41:39.765 --> 41:42.000
- I WANTED TO MEET
A NICE JEWISH GUY.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.903
- SO DID I.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.675
- WELL, LOOK, I MEAN...

41:49.708 --> 41:52.744
WHY LET A LITTLE THING
LIKE MY NOT BEING JEWISH

41:52.778 --> 41:55.213
RUIN WHAT COULD BE
A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP?

41:55.246 --> 41:57.883
- BECAUSE I WANT
A JEWISH HUSBAND.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.050
I WANT TO SETTLE DOWN,

41:59.084 --> 42:01.219
CARRY ON TRADITIONS,
HERITAGE.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.221
- WELL, I'LL--I'LL--
I'LL HAVE SURGERY.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.290
OY, MORE SURGERY.

42:05.323 --> 42:08.159
UH, I'LL, UH,
I'LL CONVERT. HUH?

42:08.193 --> 42:10.028
HEY, ELIZABETH TAYLOR
DID IT.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.897
MARILYN MONROE,
SAMMY DAVIS JR...

42:11.930 --> 42:15.767
- LOOK, YOU'RE
A NICE GUY, TED.

42:15.801 --> 42:19.204
YOU'RE JUST NOT
A NICE, JEWISH GUY.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.581
- HEY, DEB, LISTEN TO THIS.

DRIVING DRUNK,

IT'S FOR MY OWN GOOD.

TRY TO INJURE ME.

A QUESTION.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.887

I MISS YOU.

46:35.994 --> 46:39.564
- DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?

46:39.597 --> 46:42.067
- ALWAYS HAVE.

46:44.936 --> 46:48.573
ALWAYS WILL.

46:48.606 --> 46:51.242
- SO DO I.

46:53.544 --> 46:55.613
- SAID YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
NEED A FRIEND TO TALK TO,

46:55.646 --> 46:59.250
SO DO I.

46:59.284 --> 47:02.387
- ISN'T THERE A HOTLINE
FOR THAT?

47:02.420 --> 47:05.190
- IN A PINCH, YOU'LL DO.

47:05.223 --> 47:07.993
MY DATE WAS A BUST.

47:10.095 --> 47:12.363
- WHAT WENT WRONG?

47:14.099 --> 47:17.035
- YOU COULD SAY I DIDN'T
MAKE THE CUT.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.405
- YOU'LL LIVE.

47:23.274 --> 47:25.276
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.946
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

47:27.979 --> 47:30.848
- [laughs]

47:32.918 --> 47:34.485
- GET YOU A DRINK?

47:34.519 --> 47:36.955
- THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU, THEODORE.

47:36.988 --> 47:39.157
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

47:39.190 --> 47:43.494
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE
GIRLY THINGS YOU LIKE SO MUCH.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.363
ON ME.

47:45.396 --> 47:46.965
- THANKS, BRI.

47:46.998 --> 47:50.635
- ANYTHING...

47:50.668 --> 47:53.404
FOR A FRIEND.

47:53.438 --> 48:01.412
