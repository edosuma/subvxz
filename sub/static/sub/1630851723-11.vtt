with her.
I care about him.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.697
And he cares about you.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.399
He recruited you once

32:13.532 --> 32:15.167
and wanted to
recruit you again.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.303
You said yes
the first time.

without you.

vaguely complimentary.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.187

the Conglomerate
on the Blacklist.

the hit put a tracker on her,

a tracker that might give us
a clue as to their identity.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.805
If we can find it.

32:53.939 --> 32:57.476
Aram and I looked through
the evidence on file,

but it wasn't there.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.981

there was a tracker?

33:03.115 --> 33:04.550
Yes, we have
the coordinates.
