19:13.413 --> 19:16.198
[moans, choking]

19:21.769 --> 19:23.162
Help her!

19:23.292 --> 19:25.164
[Mary whimpering]

19:25.294 --> 19:27.166
[Mary screams]

19:27.296 --> 19:28.776
[man] Stay back!

19:30.169 --> 19:31.474
[woman] Someone help her.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.173
Mary...

19:34.303 --> 19:37.306
[Mary screams]

19:37.437 --> 19:38.568
Don't touch her!

19:40.657 --> 19:42.746
Help me!

19:44.139 --> 19:45.793
[townspeople exclaiming]

19:54.062 --> 19:56.369
[Mary whimpering]

20:04.855 --> 20:07.641
-[townspeople shouting]
-[Mary screaming in pain]

20:11.949 --> 20:13.516
George!

20:15.126 --> 20:16.519
Save me!

20:18.129 --> 20:22.351
[screams]

20:30.751 --> 20:31.795
Save me.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.693
Christ have mercy.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.261
Forgive me.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.872
[Samuel]
What is this witchery?

21:06.613 --> 21:09.659
We're riding
to Jerusalem's Lot

21:09.790 --> 21:11.748
to fight Jakub
and his nest of undead.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.753
If we don't stop them now,

21:16.884 --> 21:19.408
they will plunge our world
into darkness.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.152
Every one of us will die.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.588
[doctor]
How many are there?

21:27.242 --> 21:30.027
Fifteen, maybe more.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.770
They can be defeated...

21:36.469 --> 21:38.122
if we stand together
and fight.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.211
But we must act fast

21:40.342 --> 21:42.779
or today will be our last.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.782
The men who are willing
to join us, meet at the tavern.

21:48.263 --> 21:49.917
We leave in an hour.

21:50.047 --> 21:53.137
Women and children should spend
the night in the church.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.922
It's the safest place.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.708
Men,

21:58.839 --> 22:00.971
I implore you to join us.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.215
Mother.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.956
[exhales tremulously]Rebecca.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.175
I don't understand
what's happening.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.134
I know. I know.

22:33.264 --> 22:36.355
[weeps]
Mary Dennison...

22:36.485 --> 22:39.140
You and the children will stay
in the church tonight.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.576
All right?

22:40.707 --> 22:42.012
Let's hurry back
to the boarding house.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.363
We'll get provisions.
All right? Come with me.

22:54.764 --> 22:55.809
Martin.

22:57.637 --> 22:58.986
Hello, Alice.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.424
I hardly have words.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.515
I understand.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.568
Will you really ride
to Jerusalem's Lot

23:15.698 --> 23:16.699
to fight those things?

23:19.572 --> 23:20.616
I will.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.357
It's funny that I,
of all people,

23:22.488 --> 23:24.446
should feel concern
for you, but I do.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.017
I am not deserving
of anyone's concern, Alice.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.845
Least of all yours.

23:33.890 --> 23:36.806
Yeah, it's not easy
for me, Martin.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.724
But the Bible commands us
to forgive,

23:44.597 --> 23:47.077
so that we may be forgiven.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.474
Come home, Martin.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.173
Only God is perfect.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.612
What's done is done.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.180
Much to be mended between us.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.141
We can speak when I return.

24:08.577 --> 24:10.187
But what if you don't?

24:14.888 --> 24:17.760
If I never get the chance
to tell you...

24:18.892 --> 24:21.024
what's in my heart.

24:25.768 --> 24:29.076
Please, Martin.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.623
If I don't make it back
from Jerusalem's Lot...

24:57.713 --> 25:00.107
I've arranged
a proper Christian burial.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.114
[grunts with effort]

25:17.037 --> 25:18.995
[sniffles]

25:34.533 --> 25:36.056
Thank you, gentlemen.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.929
I will not lie to you.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.976
What we face

25:43.106 --> 25:46.414
will be like nothing
you've ever experienced before.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.155
The task is a difficult one.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.207
How do we kill the undead?

25:58.731 --> 26:01.690
Well, expose them
to daylight...

26:01.821 --> 26:03.083
or take their heads.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.303
They're not an easy kill.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.264
I ran Phillip Boone
through the guts,

26:10.394 --> 26:12.005
and he still fought
with the strength of two men.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.269
How did they
become this way?

26:15.399 --> 26:19.621
To become undead,
you drink the vampire's blood.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.233
Once you drink,

26:23.364 --> 26:25.235
when you die,

26:25.366 --> 26:27.847
you return like them.

26:27.977 --> 26:30.371
[doctor] Did Phillip bleed
when you fought him?

26:30.501 --> 26:31.981
He did.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.549
Then I would
attack the heart.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.595
If there's blood,
they need it.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.774
Have you all lost your wits?

26:42.862 --> 26:44.298
How can you listen
to this madman?

26:44.428 --> 26:47.388
You saw Mary Dennison.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.216
Do you deny the existence
of the undead?

26:49.346 --> 26:51.044
I do not.

26:51.174 --> 26:54.264
But I tell you...
Charles Boone is the devil.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.789
Follow him and he'll lead you
straight to hell.

26:56.919 --> 26:57.920
[Charles] He's right.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.794
Follow me and
I will take you to hell.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.100
But stay here...

27:05.362 --> 27:07.669
and hell will surely
come to you.

27:10.585 --> 27:13.022
This man is not
one of us,

27:13.153 --> 27:14.720
and yet he asks us
to fight his battles.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.243
We don't have time
for this, Samuel.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.636
Do you have
a better plan, Gallup?

27:17.766 --> 27:19.159
You're damn right I do!

27:20.813 --> 27:22.075
If what Boone says is true,

27:22.205 --> 27:25.339
then I say
let the undead come to us!

27:25.469 --> 27:27.254
We'll fight them here,

27:27.384 --> 27:30.431
as a community,
with God at our side!

27:30.561 --> 27:33.216
If we do not
strike them down,

27:33.347 --> 27:34.653
it'll be too late.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.220
Enough.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.659
If you're foolish enough
to believe in this man...

27:42.269 --> 27:44.314
then ride to your graves.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.796
Come on, Daniel.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.712
Daniel!

27:50.843 --> 27:52.975
You're on your own, Samuel.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.381
Has anyone seen
Minister Burroughs?

28:08.469 --> 28:11.733
And we ask that you
grant us strength, wisdom,

28:11.864 --> 28:13.996
and peace in our time of need.

28:15.215 --> 28:16.651
Amen.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.218
Amen.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.702
It's nice to have you home.

28:25.921 --> 28:29.708
Alice, I have so much
to say to you.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.321
So much to apologize for.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.715
I have much to say to you too,
Martin, but let's eat first.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.326
Then we'll talk.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.898
[exhales]

28:53.427 --> 28:55.168
-How is it?
-Mm!

28:56.691 --> 28:57.866
Stout with pepper.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.478
But... lovely.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.621
In case I don't get
the chance again,

29:13.752 --> 29:15.623
I want to tell you how...

29:15.754 --> 29:18.757
sorry I am
for my betrayal...

29:21.542 --> 29:23.892
and the shame
that it brought upon you.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.374
Upon us both.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.378
Of course.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.252
You and I lost our way
after the twins passed.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.389
Our shared sorrow should have
brought us together.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.086
[Alice signs deeply]

29:44.217 --> 29:46.262
Instead, it broke us.

29:47.524 --> 29:50.005
I shoulder
much of that blame.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.790
I couldn't
face their deaths.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.402
You couldn't forget them.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.449
And to escape my grief,

29:59.580 --> 30:01.190
I wrapped myself
in the arms of another woman.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.976
I have no excuse for that.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.413
Only regret.

30:07.718 --> 30:12.071
I also have regret, Martin,

30:12.201 --> 30:14.160
but we can't undo
our mistakes.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.423
We can only pay for them.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.145
I didn't kill them, Alice.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.064
Marcella Boone was not
the cause of their illness.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.110
Stephen and Phillip Boone...

30:53.286 --> 30:57.029
they walked this house
at night,

30:57.159 --> 30:58.726
while you and I slept.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.250
They preyed upon
our children.

31:01.381 --> 31:03.687
Neither of us could imagine
the real horror

31:03.818 --> 31:05.428
that had befallen us.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.478
Neither of us can be blamed.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.403
And your other child, Martin?

31:25.579 --> 31:27.407
Turns out that
he was not mine.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.627
But...

31:30.758 --> 31:33.369
[clears throat]

31:33.500 --> 31:36.024

31:38.026 --> 31:40.463

It burns.

31:40.594 --> 31:41.943
[clears throat]

31:43.858 --> 31:45.468
Well, I'm not surprised.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.730
[clears throat]

31:46.861 --> 31:50.386
What with the lies
you've told under this roof.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.649
-[Martin clears throat]
-Oh, and God's.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.738
[coughs violently]

31:54.869 --> 31:57.045
Oh... [clears throat]

31:59.308 --> 32:01.397
[coughs, gasps]

32:02.659 --> 32:04.400

32:06.054 --> 32:07.447
Something's wrong.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.058

32:10.189 --> 32:11.842
Tell it to your Maker.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.323
You'll be meeting Him
soon enough.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.542

33:01.283 --> 33:03.111
Now is the time
for the Promised

33:03.242 --> 33:05.157
to get their reward.

33:07.289 --> 33:10.249
You shall become eternal.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.556
Lords of the night.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.213
This is how you will survive
and rule

33:18.344 --> 33:20.737
with the coming of the Worm.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.132
Come.

Now turn.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.683
You won't be going
to Jerusalem's Lot.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.034
Did you ever love me?

34:40.165 --> 34:43.342
Or did you just marry me
for my father's church?

34:44.299 --> 34:46.606
No, no.

34:46.736 --> 34:47.650
Oh, God.

34:47.781 --> 34:51.263
Oh, God abandoned you
long ago.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.482
There is no escaping
one's sins.

34:53.613 --> 34:54.657

Please, Alice.
The town needs me.

35:07.322 --> 35:10.847
Ugh! The town needed you
long before this!

35:13.372 --> 35:15.852
But you abandoned us.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.680
You deserted us.

Fear not, my love.

Fear not.

There's a place in hell
for both of us.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.528
[Ann] How can you be certain
it was him?

35:39.659 --> 35:44.142
You haven't seen your father
in over 20 years.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.708
It's hard to be certain
of a lot of things lately,

35:45.839 --> 35:46.796
but I am, Mother.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.842
It was Father.

He was... [sighs]

35:52.846 --> 35:54.326
...terrifying.

But I recognized him.

He recognized me, too.
I know it.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.247
Phillip and Stephen
didn't kill him.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.770
He's been living

I know this is so horrible,

goes well beyond

38:32.397 --> 38:33.920
bad blood
between our families.

Excuse me, everyone.

May I have your attention,
please?

39:33.327 --> 39:38.376
I know that you're all
frightened and confused.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.422
There is much to be afraid of.

So tonight...

I beseech you

to pray for those of us
who ride to Jerusalem's Lot.

39:50.213 --> 39:53.913
The doors of the church
will be locked at sundown.

Those inside must remain
inside until daybreak.

Do not, under any circumstances,
open those doors for anyone.

But here we stand.

Ready to fight the enemy
on our own terms.

have been nearly impossible.

Do you think
I'm not capable?

On the contrary.

You're the strongest
