00:34.502 --> 00:35.302
Dad!

00:37.104 --> 00:40.265
Dear God.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.108
Dad?

00:47.147 --> 00:47.949
Dad!

00:52.152 --> 00:52.954
Chloe!

01:02.462 --> 01:03.489
Where's Dad?

01:03.531 --> 01:04.624
I don't know.

01:04.666 --> 01:05.825
Dad!

01:05.867 --> 01:06.659
Dad.

01:06.701 --> 01:07.860
It's okay.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.394
Are you okay?

01:09.436 --> 01:10.530
Are you okay?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.472
Oh, you okay?

01:13.541 --> 01:14.500
Where's Dad?

01:14.542 --> 01:15.568
Oh, I don't know.

01:15.610 --> 01:16.702
Dad!

01:16.744 --> 01:18.004
Dad!

01:18.046 --> 01:18.880
Dad!

01:20.515 --> 01:21.941
Where has the boat gone?

01:21.983 --> 01:23.250
I don't know.

01:24.451 --> 01:25.285
Dad!

01:26.621 --> 01:27.454
Dad!

01:29.489 --> 01:30.324
Dad!

01:33.393 --> 01:34.729
Oh, thank God.

01:36.898 --> 01:39.492
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:39.534 --> 01:41.827
Thank God, thank God.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.462
It's okay, it's okay.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.296
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.130
You okay? Are you okay?

01:45.172 --> 01:45.974
Yes.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.333
Where has the boat gone?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.435
Why would they leave us?

01:50.477 --> 01:52.437
We're gonna get through
this, its' gonna be fine.

01:52.479 --> 01:53.873
It's gonna be fine,
just calm down.

01:53.915 --> 01:55.173
Just calm down.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.852
Stay calm, stay calm. It's okay.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.249
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.952
It's gonna be fine.

02:05.994 --> 02:07.160
Just keep calm.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.726
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

02:13.768 --> 02:16.462
It's gonna be okay,
just keep calm.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.405
They know where we are.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.877
Just, just keep calm,
it's gonna be fine.

02:31.085 --> 02:34.981
Guys, there is
something in the water.

02:35.023 --> 02:36.181
Where? Where?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.817
Over there.

02:45.933 --> 02:46.934
It's okay.

02:48.870 --> 02:51.998
It's okay, just keep
still. It's gonna be fine.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.783
Dad! Dad!

03:12.760 --> 03:13.594
Dad!

03:19.834 --> 03:21.093
Dad!

03:37.652 --> 03:38.485
Lexy?

03:40.688 --> 03:42.081
Lex.

03:42.123 --> 03:42.924
Yeah.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.561
How did you sleep? Any better?

03:47.427 --> 03:48.428
Same as always.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.734
Well, I'm going into
town if you wanna come.

03:55.036 --> 03:56.204
You should get out more.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.407
Come on, a little bit of
retail therapy might help.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.077
No, it's okay.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.213
Thanks though.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.239
Okay.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.151
Well, I will see you later.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.260
Hello?

04:29.302 --> 04:30.196
Good afternoon,

04:30.238 --> 04:32.472
is Mr. McKenna there, please?

04:33.775 --> 04:34.609
Uh, hello?

04:36.644 --> 04:39.038
I'm calling from Hamptons HiFi.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.040
A while back Mr. McKenna
expressed an interest

04:41.082 --> 04:44.677
in the new range of speakers...

04:59.534 --> 05:00.926
Daddy!

05:18.519 --> 05:20.855
You feeling any
better about things?

05:24.391 --> 05:29.396
I have better days, I'm
just tired all the time.

05:30.131 --> 05:31.657
And what about a job?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.935
Have you thought about
anything you could do?

05:36.571 --> 05:38.164
And voila!

05:38.206 --> 05:40.699
Now, well, that's
better, isn't it?

05:40.741 --> 05:41.967
Thanks.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.179
Mm-hmm, pretty good
if I do say so myself.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.082
Okay, I have gotta run.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.591
So...

05:58.059 --> 06:00.628
Well, now that your nails
are looking all glamorous,

06:02.263 --> 06:04.464
I was thinking...

06:06.167 --> 06:07.392
No.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.594
Do you want to go to
party with me tonight?

06:08.636 --> 06:11.630
Come on, Lexy,
just a few people.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.399
You know, some
foods, some drinks,

06:14.441 --> 06:17.044
maybe Cards Against
Humanity, you love that.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.739
Come on, look, I'll drive,

06:20.781 --> 06:23.609
and then if you really,
are really not enjoying it,

06:23.651 --> 06:24.952
I can just bring you home.

06:26.254 --> 06:27.722
Oh, I don't know, I just...

06:30.423 --> 06:31.259
Please?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.721
Please, Lexy.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.223
Just try it.

06:37.265 --> 06:38.099
For me?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.927
I just want the old you back.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.630
You know that fun,
outgoing Lexy.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.473
I know she's in there somewhere.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.936
Please.

06:50.978 --> 06:51.812
Please.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.042
Oh, okay.

06:57.084 --> 07:01.213
Okay, so I
will pick you up at 8:00

07:01.255 --> 07:04.449
and you'll be dressed
and ready, yes?

07:04.491 --> 07:07.486
No lounge wear, okay?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.622
Eight o'clock,
I'll see you later.

07:09.664 --> 07:10.497
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.107
Ms. McKenna.

07:54.575 --> 07:58.112
I know this has been
extremely traumatic for you.

08:00.181 --> 08:02.883
Please, in your own time,

08:04.585 --> 08:06.687
tell us what you
remember from that night.

08:10.992 --> 08:11.926
I, uh...

08:13.094 --> 08:16.330
Remember us all being
on the boat, five of us.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.169
It was early evening.

08:24.305 --> 08:28.434
We just opened a bottle of
champagne and we all had some.

08:28.476 --> 08:29.643
Were you celebrating?

08:30.845 --> 08:33.405
No, not exactly.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.281
It was hot,

08:35.683 --> 08:37.918
and we'd been playing
around in the sun all day.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.814
It all went to my head.

08:41.856 --> 08:43.090
The alcohol you mean?

08:46.127 --> 08:47.228
Yeah, um...

08:50.264 --> 08:52.199
And then it was dark.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.705
I vaguely remembered dancing
with my dad, and my sister.

09:01.510 --> 09:02.743
Your sister, Chloe.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.922
And then,

09:17.758 --> 09:20.861
I was, I was dancing, I think.

09:25.433 --> 09:28.503
I tripped up, I lost my balance.

09:33.174 --> 09:35.267
Take your time, eh?

09:35.309 --> 09:36.143
It's okay.

09:46.187 --> 09:48.889
They were on the
side of the deck.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.600
I grabbed on to them to
stop myself falling and...

10:04.004 --> 10:09.009
I sent them into
the water with me.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.782
It's all right, it's okay.

10:16.585 --> 10:18.352
It wasn't your fault.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.591
Ms. McKenna, I appreciate

10:32.633 --> 10:34.326
this is extremely
difficult for you,

10:34.368 --> 10:37.464
but you really are helping
us to piece together

10:37.506 --> 10:38.839
the events from that night.

10:40.241 --> 10:45.045
So then all of you, yourself,
your father and sister,

10:46.581 --> 10:48.149
you all fell into the water.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.522
And again, in your own time,

10:55.624 --> 10:57.358
tell us what happened
from then on.

11:06.901 --> 11:07.693
Chloe.

11:12.473 --> 11:13.307
All right?

11:14.175 --> 11:16.802
It's fine, you're okay.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.912
Okay, get on.

11:21.015 --> 11:21.849
All right?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.619
You're okay. Breathe.

11:25.953 --> 11:30.115
All right, now, I need
to go have a look.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.452
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

11:33.494 --> 11:35.129
I'm gonna go under,
I'll be right back.

11:37.599 --> 11:39.526
I won't be long, I promise.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.495
You'll be fine, just
stay, stay here.

11:42.537 --> 11:44.296
- Breathe.
- Okay.

11:44.338 --> 11:45.532
- Yeah?
- Okay.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.200
I'll be right back,
I promise, okay?

11:48.242 --> 11:49.968
Okay.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.478
Just stay still.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.720
Chloe.

12:34.522 --> 12:35.356
Chloe!

12:41.328 --> 12:42.162
Chloe!

12:44.898 --> 12:45.734
Chloe?

12:46.834 --> 12:47.694
I'm here.

12:47.736 --> 12:49.161
Oh, oh my God.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.530
Oh my God.

12:50.572 --> 12:52.306
I thought I lost you.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.385
Did you see where he went?

13:05.853 --> 13:06.688
No.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.719
I'm so excited.

14:19.761 --> 14:24.098
And you look stunning,
you're gonna turn some heads.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.393
You said this
was a small thing.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.371
Yeah, small work-ish.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.514
Lex, come on.

14:40.381 --> 14:42.274
It's all the people you know.

14:42.316 --> 14:46.845
You know Brandon,
except me.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.081
- Come on.
- I can't.

14:49.123 --> 14:51.058
Please, just for a few.

14:52.393 --> 14:56.355
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

16:02.764 --> 16:07.769
Hey gorgeous.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.199
How you doin'?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.076
Sorry, did I wake you?

16:17.645 --> 16:21.683
I'm okay, almost
through another day.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.485
Come here, that's
not the attitude.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.079
It's not getting any easier.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.323
I still can't sleep.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.492
Are you having nightmares?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.798
Yeah, you were thrashing
around a lot last night.

16:40.668 --> 16:42.227
Did you get your nails done?

16:42.269 --> 16:43.437
Yeah, Amy did 'em.

16:44.606 --> 16:46.139
Tried to drag me to a party.

16:48.510 --> 16:49.309
Tried?

16:52.647 --> 16:56.049
Yeah, well, maybe next time, eh?

16:58.452 --> 17:02.247
Hey, I know something
that will cheer you up.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.357
I brought us Chinese.

17:04.526 --> 17:06.828
Come on, you're always
in the mood for Chinese.

17:09.931 --> 17:10.765
Yeah?

17:11.966 --> 17:12.991
Okay.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.359
Come on.

17:18.573 --> 17:19.665
Hi.

17:19.707 --> 17:21.868
Hi Amy, you all right?

17:21.910 --> 17:23.068
I'm good, you?

17:23.110 --> 17:26.171
Yeah, not too
bad. Can't complain.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.405
Life goes on.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.282
Yeah.

17:31.285 --> 17:32.778
Does she know you're coming?

17:32.820 --> 17:34.614
Oh, no, I don't bother
texting her anymore.

17:34.656 --> 17:36.749
I know she's more
likely to say no.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.250
Yeah, makes sense.

17:38.292 --> 17:39.519
I mean, I hope you don't
mind me just turning up.

17:39.561 --> 17:40.953
I would hate to intrude.

17:40.995 --> 17:42.555
Oh no, no, not at all.

17:42.597 --> 17:44.155
I mean, it looks like she's
here for the long haul.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.826
So it's her house
as much as mine.

17:46.868 --> 17:47.769
I suppose it is.

17:49.504 --> 17:52.163
Well, anyway, I'm off
out for a prescription.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.001
So she's in the lounge.

17:55.043 --> 17:55.877
Thanks.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.009
Hi.

18:03.051 --> 18:05.620
Not disturbing anything, am I?

18:07.555 --> 18:09.958
What's that? Daytime quiz shows?

18:10.925 --> 18:12.760
Hmm, have you learnt much?

18:14.328 --> 18:16.731
Figs contained dead wasps.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.735
That's disgusting.

18:22.570 --> 18:23.905
Where did your nails go?

18:26.641 --> 18:28.175
You scratched them all off.

18:29.644 --> 18:31.045
I'm sorry.

18:32.814 --> 18:34.272
No, it's okay.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.718
They're your nails, you do
what you like with them.

18:38.352 --> 18:42.380
Just glad I didn't go to
the trouble of waxing you.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.793
Look, there it is, there is
that winning smile of yours.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.435
Lex, listen.

18:58.372 --> 18:59.339
Babe, look at me.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.981
I've been thinking, and,

19:08.482 --> 19:11.151
I've seen you over the
past couple of months and,

19:12.720 --> 19:15.447
I don't think you're
getting any better.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.758
And after last night,

19:19.127 --> 19:21.328
look, I really think
it would be a good idea

19:23.397 --> 19:25.198
if you spoke to someone,

19:27.334 --> 19:28.736
got some therapy,

19:31.773 --> 19:33.666
I don't know.

19:33.708 --> 19:36.044
I've done some research,

19:37.177 --> 19:38.813
and I found out that the NHS,

19:40.280 --> 19:43.009
they offer counseling
for people with PTSD.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.645
I think that's
what you have, Lex.

19:45.687 --> 19:47.245
I know it's soldiers
that often get it,

19:47.287 --> 19:48.823
but your symptoms are the same.

19:50.024 --> 19:52.384
I really think you
should speak to someone.

19:52.426 --> 19:54.419
Right, do you remember Jason?

19:54.461 --> 19:55.688
Yeah, the guy who
was in the car crash

19:55.730 --> 19:57.188
when his friends died?

19:57.230 --> 20:00.559
I heard he had counseling and
it really helped him, Lexy.

20:00.601 --> 20:03.129
I'll even drive you
to the sessions.

20:03.171 --> 20:05.472
I just, I really think
you should consider it.

20:08.976 --> 20:11.713
Baby, you need to
speak to someone.

20:14.015 --> 20:14.874
Please.

20:17.552 --> 20:20.888
Look, I'll pass you
on the details, okay?

20:25.459 --> 20:26.293
Please.

20:30.565 --> 20:33.092
So I'm thinking
about seeing a shrink.

20:33.134 --> 20:34.593
Really?

20:34.635 --> 20:36.104
What's made you decide that?

20:37.205 --> 20:38.172
Amy suggested it.

20:39.173 --> 20:40.432
I had to wait ages for them

20:40.474 --> 20:41.901
to even get back to
me about my physio.

20:41.943 --> 20:45.437
And then it was six months
before there was an appointment.

20:45.479 --> 20:46.948
They really weren't very good.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.176
Yeah, all they're
gonna do is just,

20:50.218 --> 20:51.376
tell you what you wanna hear,

20:51.418 --> 20:52.912
feed you these little white lies

20:52.954 --> 20:54.722
that just make you
feel better, but,

20:55.923 --> 20:57.783
I mean they can't
change the past.

20:57.825 --> 21:00.285
You can't change
what's happened, Lex.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.897
They'll probably just
put you on more medication.

21:05.032 --> 21:06.592
Hey, but it's,
it's your choice.

21:06.634 --> 21:09.061
If you want to go for it,
we are right behind you.

21:09.103 --> 21:12.397
But in my opinion,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.776
the greatest healer is time.

21:36.531 --> 21:37.532
I'm sorry.

21:42.203 --> 21:43.004
So sorry.

22:20.308 --> 22:22.601
Hello,
welcome to The Oaks.

22:22.643 --> 22:26.205
Our working hours are nine
to five, Monday to Friday.

22:26.247 --> 22:28.741
Please call back then
or leave a message

22:28.783 --> 22:30.718
and we'll try to get
back to you soon.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.334
Hey.

23:49.830 --> 23:50.665
Come in.

23:52.233 --> 23:53.559
Hi.

23:53.601 --> 23:54.860
Lex?

23:54.902 --> 23:55.703
Yeah.

23:56.771 --> 23:58.139
Please take a seat.

24:07.548 --> 24:09.216
You don't like doors being shut.

24:10.551 --> 24:12.086
Don't worry, it's quite common.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.947
I'll just leave it ajar,

24:14.989 --> 24:17.124
that way you won't feel
like you're being closed in.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.185
, isn't it?

24:20.227 --> 24:21.195
Yeah, thanks.

24:25.700 --> 24:30.504
So, thank you for
coming to see me.

24:32.039 --> 24:34.942
My name is Francesca,
but you can call me Fran.

24:36.210 --> 24:38.270
And you are Lex?

24:38.312 --> 24:40.147
Yeah, or Lexy, whichever.

24:41.082 --> 24:43.509
Short for Alexandra?

24:43.551 --> 24:44.385
Yeah.

24:45.553 --> 24:47.880
There was a boy in my
first year called Alex,

24:47.922 --> 24:49.657
so I was Lexy since then.

24:50.925 --> 24:53.294
So now we know
each other's names.

24:55.029 --> 24:57.898
I'd like you to perhaps tell
me a little bit about you.

24:58.899 --> 25:00.434
Maybe a bit about your family.

25:02.536 --> 25:03.371
Okay.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.243
We moved to the US when
I was pretty young.

25:11.112 --> 25:12.546
My dad got a job.

25:13.814 --> 25:17.242
We were there years, I
mean, we grew up there.

25:17.284 --> 25:19.111
Long story short, we came back.

25:19.153 --> 25:22.390
My mom never really felt
at home there, you know?

25:25.826 --> 25:27.294
And then she...

25:33.934 --> 25:34.769
It's okay.

25:36.103 --> 25:40.141
I know it's hard, but
it's good to talk.

25:44.812 --> 25:48.574
Mom died about three years
ago from a brain tumor,

25:48.616 --> 25:50.184
was very sudden.

25:52.319 --> 25:55.080
I just think those things
happen to other people.

25:55.122 --> 25:56.490
It was such a shock.

25:57.925 --> 25:58.759
Sorry.

26:00.628 --> 26:03.022
Dad stayed so strong.

26:03.064 --> 26:04.398
I don't know how he did it.

26:29.857 --> 26:34.095
Your mom would've been
so proud of you two today.

26:35.830 --> 26:37.264
I'm proud of you.

26:40.968 --> 26:42.803
You're both so strong.

26:46.607 --> 26:50.177
This will go by now,
strong for each other.

26:52.581 --> 26:54.973
Become better people
'cause that's what we are,

26:55.015 --> 26:57.209
we're good people.

26:57.251 --> 26:59.920
We will get through it, I swear.

27:06.227 --> 27:08.963
It's gonna be hard
for all of us.

27:10.231 --> 27:11.924
But we'll grow stronger for it.

27:11.966 --> 27:14.468
He was the most selfless
person I've ever known.

27:15.369 --> 27:16.837
He always put us first.

27:19.541 --> 27:20.941
I wish I could've met him.

27:23.844 --> 27:25.547
Shall we take a quick break?

27:27.882 --> 27:28.916
Do you fancy a cuppa?

27:30.918 --> 27:32.554
How about a biscuit?

27:35.456 --> 27:40.461
I bet you're a chocolate
bourbon kind of girl.

27:42.463 --> 27:43.355
Custard scream.

27:43.397 --> 27:46.333
Ooh, my own personal favorite.

27:47.201 --> 27:49.428
So we have a bit more time.

27:49.470 --> 27:51.930
I'd like to move on to
the events of the day

27:51.972 --> 27:53.007
if that's all right.

27:54.241 --> 27:56.101
You don't have to go
into too much detail,

27:56.143 --> 27:59.572
maybe just a bit about
who you were with,

27:59.614 --> 28:01.749
the way you were,
that sort of thing.

28:03.417 --> 28:07.112
We were in South Africa on
our first family vacation,

28:07.154 --> 28:09.081
since dad remarried.

28:09.123 --> 28:10.592
- What was her name?
- Vicky

28:12.793 --> 28:15.721
Dad actually wanted to
go to the Caribbean.

28:15.763 --> 28:18.757
Vicky wanted South Africa,
that's why we went there.

28:18.799 --> 28:20.334
And where did you want to go?

28:21.969 --> 28:23.563
Oh, I don't know.

28:23.605 --> 28:28.200
Maybe the Caribbean, I
didn't mind it.

28:28.242 --> 28:31.236
Vicky insisted that
my boyfriend came too.

28:31.278 --> 28:32.404
Your boyfriend?

28:32.446 --> 28:34.239
Yeah, Isaac.

28:34.281 --> 28:38.219
We'd been together about
six months at the time.

28:39.286 --> 28:40.921
Dad really liked him.

28:41.922 --> 28:43.282
So five of you then.

28:43.324 --> 28:45.518
One day we chartered a boat,

28:45.560 --> 28:48.896
a small cruiser,
nothing too fancy.

28:50.064 --> 28:51.966
Isaac has a license,
so he took us out.

28:53.334 --> 28:55.135
It was such a beautiful day.

28:57.238 --> 29:00.866
We played around in one
of those inflatable boats

29:00.908 --> 29:01.942
off the side,

29:03.110 --> 29:08.115
had a few drinks.

29:20.494 --> 29:21.328
Lex.

29:22.530 --> 29:23.364
Lex.

29:24.999 --> 29:26.267
Was it really that bad?

29:28.769 --> 29:31.930
Yeah, well I'm sure it's gonna
be difficult to start with.

29:31.972 --> 29:33.932
You did have a pretty traumatic
event happen to you so...

29:33.974 --> 29:35.276
I know, I was there.

29:41.215 --> 29:42.049
Sorry.

29:43.484 --> 29:46.178
Just, you just
gotta stick at it.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.146
Don't let the first
session put you off.

29:48.188 --> 29:49.591
They're only trying to help.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.761
Come on, let's go.

30:14.148 --> 30:15.941
You were gone a long time.

30:15.983 --> 30:17.342
Did you go anywhere nice?

30:17.384 --> 30:19.219
For a picnic.

30:20.254 --> 30:21.088
A picnic?

30:22.122 --> 30:23.315
On your own.

30:23.357 --> 30:24.584
No, with Amy.

30:24.626 --> 30:26.418
She had the day off.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.697
A little bit chilly
for a picnic, isn't it?

30:31.231 --> 30:35.336
She brought hot
chocolate, so it was okay.

30:36.837 --> 30:38.030
Yeah, this takes the edge off.

30:38.072 --> 30:39.499
Can I have some wine?

30:39.541 --> 30:41.634
I thought you couldn't
have it with your medication.

30:41.676 --> 30:43.168
I stopped taking it.

30:43.210 --> 30:45.103
But didn't the doctor say
to carry on for a lil' longer?

30:45.145 --> 30:50.117
I did, for two months.

30:54.188 --> 30:56.423
Are you gonna pour
one for me and Isaac?

30:58.325 --> 30:59.694
Yeah, sorry.

31:01.529 --> 31:02.363
There he is.

31:04.632 --> 31:05.824
Drinking wine?

31:05.866 --> 31:06.958
Seems that I am?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.661
Whoa, go easy.

31:08.703 --> 31:12.139
You know the effect
it can have on you.

31:21.716 --> 31:23.241
Thanks, Vicks,
it was delicious.

31:23.283 --> 31:25.919
You're welcome.
How was your day?

31:26.887 --> 31:28.980
Yeah, pretty good actually.

31:29.022 --> 31:30.750
I had a meeting
with a new client.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.585
They weren't sure the
deal was gonna go through

31:32.627 --> 31:35.630
but I went in, cranked the
old charm, and job done.

31:36.564 --> 31:37.824
Well done.

31:37.866 --> 31:39.032
Knew you had it in you.

31:43.237 --> 31:44.405
How was your day, Lex?

31:45.372 --> 31:46.974
She went for a
picnic with Amy.

31:49.276 --> 31:50.077
A picnic?

31:52.547 --> 31:53.338
In this weather?

31:53.380 --> 31:54.948
That's what I said.

31:56.316 --> 31:57.477
Must be pretty tramautic

31:57.519 --> 31:58.452
the way you're
drinking that wine.

32:12.032 --> 32:13.868
Time for bed, madam.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.533
You're gonna regret that
second bottle of wine

32:20.575 --> 32:21.408
in the morning.

32:54.576 --> 32:58.979
Not tonight. I'm
knackered, okay?

33:01.248 --> 33:02.775
You're drunk.

33:02.817 --> 33:04.284
Maybe tomorrow, eh?

33:05.687 --> 33:06.521
Yeah.

33:09.791 --> 33:12.885
Get some sleep, you're drunk?

33:12.927 --> 33:13.761
Goodnight.

33:19.166 --> 33:22.093
So last week, we
talked a bit about your family

33:22.135 --> 33:25.430
and later on in the afternoon
you started drinking.

33:25.472 --> 33:26.306
Yeah.

33:27.509 --> 33:29.476
What time
is that? Five-ish?

33:30.512 --> 33:31.771
Yeah, probably.

33:31.813 --> 33:34.081
And whose idea was
it to start drinking?

33:35.650 --> 33:38.043
I don't know.

33:38.085 --> 33:39.645
We had a ton of
drinks in the ice box,

33:39.687 --> 33:41.556
so it was gonna
happen at some point.

33:42.824 --> 33:45.459
And would you say that
you usually drunk a lot?

33:46.661 --> 33:48.863
Well, I wasn't long
out of university, so.

33:50.765 --> 33:51.966
I remember those days.

33:55.168 --> 33:59.932
So you were all having
fun on the boat.

33:59.974 --> 34:00.742
Yeah.

34:02.276 --> 34:05.914
Dad likes, liked
to have a party.

35:05.339 --> 35:10.344
Oh my God,
how much have you drunk?

35:15.850 --> 35:17.685
Wait, oh, hey, wait.

35:18.886 --> 35:20.622
- What was that?
- What?

35:22.523 --> 35:24.617
Do they have dolphins here?

35:24.659 --> 35:25.492
Why?

35:27.427 --> 35:29.363
I'm sure I saw a fin.

35:33.067 --> 35:35.628
Get us out! Get us out!

35:35.670 --> 35:37.763
Get us out! Get us out!

35:58.559 --> 35:59.952
Lex.

35:59.994 --> 36:02.462
Lex, listen. Look at me.

36:05.465 --> 36:08.235
I can see that you
blame yourself.

36:10.237 --> 36:11.839
Sometimes things just happen.

36:12.974 --> 36:14.474
There's no reason for it.

36:15.610 --> 36:19.580
Universe is just a
series of random events.

36:24.886 --> 36:25.953
It was my fault.

36:29.891 --> 36:32.026
It was my fault we
fell in the water.

36:33.728 --> 36:36.589
It's my fault they're dead.

36:36.631 --> 36:38.398
Please don't think like that.

36:40.902 --> 36:43.071
You're here, you survived.

36:45.773 --> 36:47.340
Sometimes I wish I didn't.

37:01.556 --> 37:03.149
Okay?

37:03.191 --> 37:04.150
Thanks.

37:04.192 --> 37:05.584
Anytime.

37:05.626 --> 37:07.953
Don't give up now, I'm
sure you're making progress

37:07.995 --> 37:09.597
even if it doesn't seem like it.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.133
Okay?

37:19.040 --> 37:19.965
Amy.

37:20.007 --> 37:21.366
Jesus.

37:21.408 --> 37:22.242
Not quite.

37:23.177 --> 37:24.837
What are you up to?

37:24.879 --> 37:26.939
Oh, nothing much,
just a bit of gardening.

37:26.981 --> 37:28.182
I had the afternoon off.

37:29.984 --> 37:32.086
How was your picnic
the other week?

37:33.221 --> 37:35.413
Picnic?

37:35.455 --> 37:39.250
Yeah, Lex said you went
on a picnic last week.

37:39.292 --> 37:40.251
No, I...

37:40.293 --> 37:42.496
Oh, sorry, the picnic.

37:43.664 --> 37:45.365
Yeah, it was, it
was good, thanks.

37:49.003 --> 37:49.937
Where'd you go?

37:50.805 --> 37:53.406
Just somewhere local, a park.

37:54.407 --> 37:55.243
What'd you eat?

37:56.644 --> 38:00.405
Sandwiches, nibbles,
you know, picnics things.

38:00.447 --> 38:01.339
What kind of sandwiches?

38:01.381 --> 38:02.808
Look, I'm really sorry.

38:02.850 --> 38:06.579
I've got to head off, so
I'll catch you later, okay?

38:06.621 --> 38:07.454
Okay.

38:08.589 --> 38:09.422
Bye.

38:15.730 --> 38:16.856
Ms. McKenna, I'm
going to show you

38:16.898 --> 38:18.398
a couple of photographs.

38:20.168 --> 38:23.171
This is the dinghy the Coast
Guard found you clinging to.

38:26.306 --> 38:28.366
Do you recognize this dinghy?

38:28.408 --> 38:31.003
Yeah, it's from the boat.

38:31.045 --> 38:33.939
And you and the
other people on board

38:33.981 --> 38:36.349
were playing in this
inflatable during the day?

39:22.997 --> 39:24.190
Do you recall how the dinghy

39:24.232 --> 39:25.800
came to be in the
water at night?

39:28.970 --> 39:32.840
I think Isaac or Vicky
threw it in to help.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.708
Hey, babe.

40:15.750 --> 40:16.976
Look, I'm really sorry,
I've got to cover a shift

40:17.018 --> 40:19.812
at work today, so I
can't drive you in.

40:19.854 --> 40:22.715
Maybe see if Vicky can.

40:22.757 --> 40:23.949
Look, I've gotta go.

40:23.991 --> 40:25.726
I'll catch up with you
later.

40:37.405 --> 40:38.764
You know, if you've
got health problems

40:38.806 --> 40:40.641
you can talk to me
about it, you know.

40:41.876 --> 40:44.402
Whatever it is, I've
probably had it myself

40:44.444 --> 40:47.114
or at least had experience
talking to people about it.

40:48.549 --> 40:50.242
Come on, I'm all ears.

40:50.284 --> 40:51.610
It's nothing, I'm fine.

40:51.652 --> 40:53.554
- It's just a checkup.
- For what?

40:54.689 --> 40:56.390
A scan, it's nothing.

40:58.526 --> 41:01.987
All right, well, you know
where I am if you need me.

41:02.029 --> 41:02.863
Thanks.

41:04.532 --> 41:05.524
You're not pregnant, are you?

41:05.566 --> 41:08.661
Oh God. No, definitely not.

41:08.703 --> 41:09.537
Good.

41:20.014 --> 41:22.675
There maybe another reason

41:22.717 --> 41:24.318
why you reached for the alcohol.

41:25.419 --> 41:27.880
It's common for
people who've suffered

41:27.922 --> 41:31.183
a traumatic experience
like you did,

41:31.225 --> 41:33.451
for them to try and
recreate that experience

41:33.493 --> 41:36.355
in order to prove to themselves

41:36.397 --> 41:37.999
that they could stay in control.

41:38.866 --> 41:40.201
It's forward catharsis.

41:41.635 --> 41:44.863
Now it's possible that you
have reached for the alcohol

41:44.905 --> 41:48.342
to try and prove to yourself
that you can stay in control.

41:49.810 --> 41:54.006
And that maybe there was
another element that meant

41:54.048 --> 41:57.309
that it wasn't your fault
like you've so far believed.

41:57.351 --> 42:00.012
What, so you think there's
something more to it?

42:00.054 --> 42:02.181
I'm suggesting there
might be another reason

42:02.223 --> 42:04.892
why you started drinking again.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.796
I mean, you told me you could
handle your drink in the past.

42:12.466 --> 42:14.693
You told me that
it was a hot day

42:14.735 --> 42:17.062
and you were expending
plenty of energy

42:17.104 --> 42:20.307
swimming, having
fun in the dinghy.

42:21.776 --> 42:23.778
It's possible that
you were lightheaded,

42:24.712 --> 42:26.939
dehydrated, thirsty.

42:26.981 --> 42:29.274
You had a couple of
glasses of champagne.

42:29.316 --> 42:32.911
Now the bubbles make
the blood absorb

42:32.953 --> 42:34.321
the alcohol more quickly.

42:35.689 --> 42:38.192
I know if it was me I'd be
more than a little lightheaded.

42:39.827 --> 42:43.222
Possibly, but I still
never black out like that.

42:43.264 --> 42:47.026
Even when I'm really wasted,
I remember everything.

42:47.068 --> 42:49.504
Even when I don't want
to, it's kind of annoying.

42:50.671 --> 42:52.973
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

42:55.743 --> 42:57.336
Happens to most
drinkers eventually,

42:57.378 --> 43:00.139
although there is usually
a combination of things

43:00.181 --> 43:02.383
which would make you black out.

43:09.824 --> 43:11.526
There was something
in my drink.

43:13.294 --> 43:16.063
You think your drink
may have been spiked.

43:16.997 --> 43:18.223
Maybe.

43:18.265 --> 43:19.858
Well, that is a
strong statement.

43:19.900 --> 43:21.894
I mean, do you have
any reason to think

43:21.936 --> 43:23.671
that anyone would
try and drug you?

43:25.039 --> 43:27.966
No, Dad would never.

43:28.008 --> 43:30.335
Chloe wouldn't,
not even as a joke.

43:30.377 --> 43:31.504
Isaac would have no need to,

43:31.546 --> 43:33.214
we were actually
having sex back then.

43:34.381 --> 43:36.075
And Vicky, I...

43:36.117 --> 43:37.676
Would you
have had any reason

43:37.718 --> 43:39.978
to believe that Vicky would?

43:40.020 --> 43:41.514
No.

43:41.556 --> 43:44.825
Okay, well, let's go over
it again with that in mind.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.420
Where have you been?
I was waiting for you.

44:21.462 --> 44:22.654
I'm sorry, I needed a walk.

44:22.696 --> 44:24.365
Well, you could have
answered your phone.

44:31.338 --> 44:34.032
What? How did we get here?

44:34.074 --> 44:35.409
What's going on?

44:36.877 --> 44:38.170
I don't know.

44:38.212 --> 44:39.648
Where's the boat?

44:40.549 --> 44:42.374
It's over there. Help!

44:42.416 --> 44:43.375
- Hey!
- Hey!

44:43.417 --> 44:44.251
Help!

44:47.221 --> 44:48.647
We need help over here!

44:48.689 --> 44:49.482
Help!

44:49.524 --> 44:50.483
Help!

44:50.525 --> 44:52.017
- Get us out!
- Over here!

45:01.068 --> 45:02.595
- Where is he!
- Dad!

45:02.637 --> 45:05.364
Where is he? Where is he?

45:05.406 --> 45:06.240
Dad!

45:09.511 --> 45:12.472
- One, Lexy?
- No, thanks.

45:12.514 --> 45:13.772
Probably a good idea.

45:13.814 --> 45:15.307
You were snoring
a bit last night.

45:15.349 --> 45:19.178
Hey, you oughta
get a lil' crack at that gym.

45:19.220 --> 45:20.522
You celebrate?

45:25.025 --> 45:28.295
You know, that
night in South Africa.

45:30.532 --> 45:31.690
You mean...

45:31.732 --> 45:33.100
The night my dad
and Chloe were killed.

45:35.637 --> 45:36.470
Yeah.

45:38.472 --> 45:40.575
Can you remind me
what happened exactly?

45:42.243 --> 45:43.735
I just want to
clarify a few things.

45:43.777 --> 45:46.013
I know I was drinking a lot and,

45:47.181 --> 45:49.416
need to remind myself
that it was an accident.

45:52.286 --> 45:53.120
Okay.

45:55.789 --> 45:57.458
Yeah, we hired the yacht.

45:58.993 --> 46:00.361
Whose idea was that?

46:02.162 --> 46:03.889
I think it was your dad's.

46:03.931 --> 46:06.166
Yeah, you
know what, so do I.

46:07.569 --> 46:08.402
Yeah.

46:10.639 --> 46:11.472
Go on.

46:13.807 --> 46:16.735
Then we sailed it out off
the coast to the shallow waters

46:16.777 --> 46:18.003
and dropped anchor.

46:18.045 --> 46:19.681
Okay. How far out?

46:21.282 --> 46:23.050
How far? A half a mile?

46:25.052 --> 46:29.649
Then we dropped the dinghy
and played around in it a bit

46:29.691 --> 46:30.749
and so on.

46:30.791 --> 46:31.892
So you got in it?

46:33.628 --> 46:36.556
Yeah, I was in the dinghy
with you at some point.

46:36.598 --> 46:37.431
Okay.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.101
When did we start drinking?

46:43.337 --> 46:44.464
Uh...

46:44.506 --> 46:45.573
Five, six.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.274
Yeah.

46:50.545 --> 46:52.514
And we were drinking what?

46:54.181 --> 46:55.015
Champagne?

46:56.216 --> 46:58.176
Oh, no, sparkling
wine. Local stuff.

46:58.218 --> 46:59.453
It was quite good.

47:00.421 --> 47:01.955
Yeah, Dad poured that, right?

47:04.992 --> 47:05.826
Yep.

47:07.494 --> 47:08.688
And then?

47:08.730 --> 47:12.124
Then we played a
few games, you know,

47:12.166 --> 47:13.668
card games and so on.

47:15.202 --> 47:16.036
Who won?

47:18.606 --> 47:20.098
We all won.

47:20.140 --> 47:23.077
Yeah, I mean, we weren't
exactly keeping track, so.

47:24.612 --> 47:26.213
And we were all drinking?

47:27.981 --> 47:29.475
Yeah.

47:29.517 --> 47:33.445
Okay, so after the, the
first glass of champagne,

47:33.487 --> 47:35.222
who gave me the next one?

47:36.990 --> 47:39.828
I don't know, it was, it
was quite a long time ago.

47:46.133 --> 47:48.761
Lex, what's this about, huh?

47:48.803 --> 47:50.395
I'm struggling to
come to terms with it

47:50.437 --> 47:53.198
and just want the details.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.634
Yeah, but we've told
you all of this before.

47:54.676 --> 47:56.168
- Nothing's changed.
- I know.

47:56.210 --> 48:00.715
I just can't understand
some things like,

48:01.783 --> 48:03.041
how did we end up in the water?

48:03.083 --> 48:04.051
You tripped.

48:05.185 --> 48:07.020
Lexy, we've been over
this, you tripped.

48:07.888 --> 48:09.381
You were very drunk.

48:09.423 --> 48:11.083
Yeah, very drunk.

48:11.125 --> 48:12.585
More drunk than
I've ever seen you.

48:12.627 --> 48:17.632
We were all dancing around
having fun, and you tripped.

48:18.833 --> 48:20.693
You grabbed on to
your dad and Chloe

48:20.735 --> 48:22.662
and tried to use them
to save yourself,

48:22.704 --> 48:24.905
but just ended up
dragging them in with you.

48:27.007 --> 48:28.308
You were there, you saw?

48:30.678 --> 48:33.681
Yeah, well, I was
below deck with Vicky.

48:34.883 --> 48:37.209
You just said we
were all dancing.

48:37.251 --> 48:38.043
We were.

48:38.085 --> 48:39.453
Yeah, we were.

48:41.088 --> 48:42.214
I mean, you know
how parties are,

48:42.256 --> 48:43.882
people go off in
different directions,

48:43.924 --> 48:45.150
different rooms and...

48:45.192 --> 48:47.085
Music was really
loud on the deck.

48:47.127 --> 48:50.155
So we went below for a chat.

48:50.197 --> 48:51.591
What were you talking about?

48:51.633 --> 48:55.026
It was about the plans
for the next few days.

48:55.068 --> 48:56.395
Oh, yeah, we were
going to go off

48:56.437 --> 48:58.296
to Table Mountain and stuff.

48:58.338 --> 49:01.333
If you were below deck, how
did you know that I tripped?

49:01.375 --> 49:03.201
Well, you told the police.

49:03.243 --> 49:06.213
If I don't remember,
how did I tell them that?

49:10.050 --> 49:12.186
You suffered a very
traumatic experience,

49:13.655 --> 49:15.748
and in a lot of trauma cases,

49:15.790 --> 49:19.284
you might remember straight
after, but then after that,

49:19.326 --> 49:20.327
you're gonna forget.

49:21.495 --> 49:23.221
Probably what happened,
you told the police

49:23.263 --> 49:24.532
and now you've forgotten.

49:25.466 --> 49:26.568
And you were drinking.

49:27.936 --> 49:29.970
Like drinking
affects the memory.

49:31.238 --> 49:34.132
I mean, you can blank
it out all you like

49:34.174 --> 49:36.435
and we can go over the details
again and again if you want,

49:36.477 --> 49:40.939
but it's not gonna
change what happened

49:40.981 --> 49:41.816
and it's just...

49:44.184 --> 49:48.489
It's not gonna change the
fact that it is your fault.

49:50.625 --> 49:53.494
Nothing we can say is
ever gonna change that.

49:55.229 --> 49:57.255
And that's just something
that you're gonna have

49:57.297 --> 50:00.358
to live with for the
rest of your life.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.235
It's...

50:26.728 --> 50:27.562
Hey.

50:30.598 --> 50:31.431
You okay?

50:33.066 --> 50:33.902
Do you care?

50:36.804 --> 50:38.464
Sorry, I was a
bit harsh earlier.

50:38.506 --> 50:41.241
You know, you gotta be cool
to be kind and all that.

50:44.378 --> 50:46.948
Hey, so you got drunk.

50:48.081 --> 50:49.842
Everyone gets
trashed occasionally

50:49.884 --> 50:53.755
especially at your age, and bad
shit happens when you drink.

50:55.122 --> 50:57.859
And yes, this was very bad shit.

50:59.359 --> 51:03.497
But, you've gotta come to
terms with the fact that,

51:06.233 --> 51:07.234
this was your fault,

51:08.502 --> 51:11.104
and nothing we can ever
say would change that.

51:16.076 --> 51:18.604
- Anyway, I...
- What's that?

51:18.646 --> 51:19.814
Is that a scar?

51:22.850 --> 51:23.685
Yeah.

51:24.886 --> 51:27.254
How'd you get it?
I don't remember it.

51:28.656 --> 51:30.448
Just a work thing,

51:30.490 --> 51:34.052
I think it was a
cheeseboard or something.

51:34.094 --> 51:35.755
Quite a
place to cut yourself.

51:35.797 --> 51:38.089
Yeah, I mean, I
was, I was drunk.

51:38.131 --> 51:40.292
I don't exactly remember it, so.

51:40.334 --> 51:42.036
Drinking does
affect the memory.

51:46.975 --> 51:51.946
Anyway,
gotta head to work.

51:53.548 --> 51:55.541
It's this fucking
deal with Japan,

51:55.583 --> 51:56.818
I know, it's so annoying.

51:58.285 --> 52:01.179
Just gotta go to the office
and finalize a few things.

52:01.221 --> 52:05.518
So I might be there
until the early hours

52:05.560 --> 52:08.362
or I might just stay there.

52:10.832 --> 52:14.026
Anyway, look at these.

52:14.068 --> 52:17.805
I thought maybe
they'll help you sleep.

52:18.806 --> 52:20.207
You been having trouble, so.

52:26.814 --> 52:27.649
Take 'em.

54:09.316 --> 54:10.218
Lex. Lex.

54:11.185 --> 54:12.019
Wait.

54:14.021 --> 54:14.856
Lex, wait!

54:16.289 --> 54:17.483
Lex.

54:17.525 --> 54:20.186
Look, things haven't
been the same since...

54:20.228 --> 54:23.064
You haven't been the same
and this just kinda happened.

54:24.331 --> 54:25.967
It just happened?

54:27.168 --> 54:29.402
You won't fucking
touch me, is she why?

54:30.772 --> 54:33.532
What other lies have
you been feeding me?

54:33.574 --> 54:35.735
Lex, please, just calm down.

54:35.777 --> 54:37.636
- Put the knife down.
- I hate you.

54:37.678 --> 54:39.472
Put the knife down.

54:39.514 --> 54:40.581
I hate you.

54:43.350 --> 54:44.585
Okay, just...

54:46.419 --> 54:47.354
Fuck you.

54:48.656 --> 54:50.224
I fucking hate you.

54:53.360 --> 54:54.419
Put the knife down.

54:54.461 --> 54:55.821
Don't...

54:55.863 --> 54:57.223
Get out!

54:57.265 --> 54:58.190
Lex.

54:58.232 --> 54:59.792
- Get out!
- Okay.

54:59.834 --> 55:01.102
I'm going, okay?

55:55.323 --> 55:56.157
Morning.

55:58.159 --> 55:59.952
What are you still doing here?

55:59.994 --> 56:00.761
I live here.

56:01.963 --> 56:03.989
Not anymore, get the
fuck out of my house.

56:04.031 --> 56:05.365
But it's my house, Lexy.

56:10.437 --> 56:13.431
Realistically, I could
ask you to move out.

56:13.473 --> 56:15.467
I mean, you've been living
here for these past few months

56:15.509 --> 56:16.844
without paying any rent.

56:18.679 --> 56:21.874
But no, I've been good to you.

56:21.916 --> 56:23.551
Extremely patient.

56:24.919 --> 56:26.812
Paid your way while
you've been out for work,

56:26.854 --> 56:29.114
cooked for you, cleaned for you,

56:29.156 --> 56:30.649
put up with your moods.

56:30.691 --> 56:32.318
Acted like a mother to you.

56:32.360 --> 56:34.086
You're sick.

56:34.128 --> 56:36.055
My mother could
never do that to me.

56:36.097 --> 56:37.990
Oh, sweetie.

56:38.032 --> 56:39.734
That relationship
died months ago.

56:41.168 --> 56:42.761
You didn't really think
he was gonna stay with you

56:42.803 --> 56:45.331
while you were in
this state, did you?

56:45.373 --> 56:46.707
It was inevitable.

56:48.142 --> 56:49.301
We were just waiting for the
right moment to tell you.

56:49.343 --> 56:52.304
You didn't just tell
me, you showed me.

56:52.346 --> 56:54.506
Well, we thought
you'd be asleep.

56:54.548 --> 56:56.449
Asleep? That's your excuse?

57:10.364 --> 57:11.724
Hi, this is Amy Watkins.

57:11.766 --> 57:12.958
Please leave a message,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.069
and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can.

57:40.928 --> 57:42.154
Lex!

57:42.196 --> 57:43.856
Sorry, have you
got a few minutes?

57:43.898 --> 57:45.090
I really need to talk to you.

57:45.132 --> 57:47.493
I'm sorry, I'm with
a client, and I'm...

57:47.535 --> 57:49.370
Please, just five minutes.

57:51.172 --> 57:52.464
No, no, it's fine.

57:52.506 --> 57:53.431
I'll wait outside.

57:53.473 --> 57:54.600
Really?

57:54.642 --> 57:55.534
It's fine.

57:55.576 --> 57:57.903
I'm so sorry, thank you.

57:57.945 --> 57:58.837
Lex, this is most...

57:58.879 --> 58:00.114
She did it.

58:02.083 --> 58:03.542
They fucking did it.

58:03.584 --> 58:06.120
Vicky and Isaac, I'm sure they
had something to do with it.

58:07.688 --> 58:10.282
What? The attack?

58:10.324 --> 58:11.550
I've been piecing
it all together

58:11.592 --> 58:13.686
and the more I think
about it, the more,

58:13.728 --> 58:14.829
it just fits.

58:16.931 --> 58:19.367
I caught, I caught them.

58:22.470 --> 58:24.096
I caught them.

58:24.138 --> 58:24.972
Oh my God.

58:29.510 --> 58:30.344
Okay.

58:31.312 --> 58:33.405
Before you make any assumptions

58:33.447 --> 58:38.452
or go around accusing anybody,
let's go over the facts.

58:42.790 --> 58:43.624
Right.

58:45.059 --> 58:49.555
The police, they ruled out
anything suspicious, didn't they?

58:49.597 --> 58:50.531
Yeah.

58:51.699 --> 58:53.534
Then you need to
be absolutely sure.

58:56.237 --> 58:57.538
Let's go through it again.

59:04.311 --> 59:07.048
So, Ms. McKenna, I,

59:08.215 --> 59:09.583
I hate to ask this,

59:10.818 --> 59:12.211
but is there any
reason you can think of

59:12.253 --> 59:14.889
as to why this might not
have been an accident?

59:16.557 --> 59:17.892
Not an accident?

59:18.759 --> 59:21.253
Yes, any reason you believe

59:21.295 --> 59:24.423
that maybe somebody in your
party wanted to see you,

59:24.465 --> 59:27.301
your father and your
sister end up in the water?

59:29.303 --> 59:30.497
No, no way.

59:30.539 --> 59:34.575
Okay, so as far as
your opinion goes,

59:35.510 --> 59:36.635
the events were usual.

59:36.677 --> 59:38.437
There was nothing suspicious.

59:38.479 --> 59:40.014
No, I don't think so.

59:42.983 --> 59:47.179
Is there a chance that your
drinks might have been spiked?

59:47.221 --> 59:48.122
Why?

59:49.090 --> 59:50.282
You tell us.

59:50.324 --> 59:51.884
We don't know the
people involved.

59:51.926 --> 59:54.128
You'd have a much better
idea than we would.

59:58.799 --> 1:00:00.901
Vicky for example.

1:00:02.369 --> 1:00:05.397
You said she's your
father's second wife.

1:00:05.439 --> 1:00:06.273
Yeah.

1:00:07.808 --> 1:00:09.677
What are your
feelings towards her?

1:00:10.644 --> 1:00:13.147
Any hostility between you?

1:00:16.984 --> 1:00:18.444
I mean, it's weird.

1:00:18.486 --> 1:00:21.580
I mean, I mean, my, my mom died

1:00:21.622 --> 1:00:23.858
and she had been
there my whole life.

1:00:25.126 --> 1:00:25.960
I mean, I,

1:00:28.095 --> 1:00:32.357
I guess I thought it was a
little soon for Dad to remarry,

1:00:32.399 --> 1:00:36.028
but he was happy.

1:00:36.070 --> 1:00:39.039
It wasn't my place
to question that.

1:02:28.583 --> 1:02:29.808
Going somewhere?

1:02:29.850 --> 1:02:31.710
Get out of my way.

1:02:31.752 --> 1:02:32.820
How was counseling?

1:02:44.365 --> 1:02:47.702
Now be a good girl,
and take your pills.

1:02:48.737 --> 1:02:49.738
No!

1:02:59.681 --> 1:03:00.981
There you go. Swallow.

1:03:01.982 --> 1:03:04.184
Come on, get em down, yeah?

1:03:05.152 --> 1:03:05.986
Swallow.

1:03:11.492 --> 1:03:12.326
Good girl.

1:03:13.894 --> 1:03:14.729
Now sleep.

1:07:47.167 --> 1:07:48.836
Come on, the keys.

1:07:50.203 --> 1:07:51.039
Oh, fuck.

1:08:24.539 --> 1:08:26.206
Looking for these?

1:08:30.477 --> 1:08:31.813
Give me those.

1:09:06.814 --> 1:09:07.649
Feel familiar?

1:09:09.550 --> 1:09:13.253
What's going through
your mind, Lexy?

1:09:14.756 --> 1:09:16.256
You feeling lucky?

1:09:17.424 --> 1:09:20.052
Probably not a good idea
to go into the water.

1:09:20.094 --> 1:09:22.030
You know, it could
be anything in there.

1:09:26.034 --> 1:09:29.929
Crocodiles, maybe a piranha.

1:09:29.971 --> 1:09:32.674
It's amazing what you can go
off the dark web these days.

1:09:36.577 --> 1:09:37.837
Oh, and in case you forgot

1:09:37.879 --> 1:09:40.673
what with all the
wine and drugs,

1:09:40.715 --> 1:09:42.416
it's your sister's
birthday today.

1:09:47.187 --> 1:09:50.892
She would have been
20 if she hadn't...

1:09:54.227 --> 1:09:56.097
Weird things,
birthdays, aren't they?

1:09:57.565 --> 1:10:00.826
People celebrate as if you've
made some massive achievement

1:10:00.868 --> 1:10:02.028
when all you've really done

1:10:02.070 --> 1:10:03.571
is just gone another
year surviving.

1:10:06.507 --> 1:10:08.475
I mean hardly an
achievement, isn't it?

1:10:10.210 --> 1:10:11.045
Maybe it is.

1:10:15.348 --> 1:10:20.353
Anyway, I thought I'd
pay a little tribute

1:10:23.323 --> 1:10:24.559
to your sister.

1:10:26.828 --> 1:10:29.463
So I put together some scenes
from her last birthday.

1:10:31.032 --> 1:10:31.933
No images.

1:10:33.467 --> 1:10:34.301
Just sound.

1:10:36.938 --> 1:10:39.339
I'm sure you won't struggle
to put the pictures in.

1:10:41.341 --> 1:10:43.511
That's the great thing
about memories, isn't it?

1:10:44.746 --> 1:10:48.616
You can replay them over
and over and over again.

1:11:01.529 --> 1:11:02.362
Good luck.

1:11:30.625 --> 1:11:31.692
Oh, please.

1:11:34.228 --> 1:11:35.062
Please.

1:11:58.085 --> 1:11:58.886
Chloe!

1:12:00.288 --> 1:12:01.088
It's okay.

1:12:02.223 --> 1:12:04.315
It's okay, it's just a pool.

1:12:04.357 --> 1:12:05.526
You love swimming

1:12:10.463 --> 1:12:12.691
There's nothing in there.

1:12:12.733 --> 1:12:15.603
There's nothing in there that
can hurt you, he's lying.

1:12:22.944 --> 1:12:24.278
It's just water.

1:13:59.907 --> 1:14:01.967
Okay, go.

1:14:02.009 --> 1:14:04.570
Yeah, Dad, your turn, go.

1:14:06.580 --> 1:14:07.682
Oh God, stop.

1:14:08.616 --> 1:14:09.608
You want me to stop?

1:14:09.650 --> 1:14:11.953
Yeah, stop it. That's awful.

1:14:13.087 --> 1:14:15.156
Smile, happy Christmas.

1:14:23.965 --> 1:14:25.132
Okay, hang on.

1:14:48.990 --> 1:14:50.749
One, two, three.

1:14:50.791 --> 1:14:53.561
Merry Christmas.

1:15:21.155 --> 1:15:22.256
Fuck. Okay.

1:15:33.334 --> 1:15:34.168
Oh, fuck.

1:15:35.002 --> 1:15:35.836
Come on!

1:16:10.471 --> 1:16:12.473
You won't get in here.

1:16:13.407 --> 1:16:14.675
Then come out!

1:16:16.210 --> 1:16:20.147
Come out and tell me what
the fuck is going on.

1:16:21.582 --> 1:16:23.675
Come on, or I'll...

1:16:23.717 --> 1:16:26.387
You'll what? Break up with me?

1:16:28.956 --> 1:16:30.991
You sure as hell won't
get out the house.

1:16:36.163 --> 1:16:37.965
We've got a pretty
good setup in it.

1:16:39.900 --> 1:16:42.303
Plenty of food, and en suite.

1:16:43.637 --> 1:16:45.840
And of course your
stepmom for entertainment.

1:16:52.913 --> 1:16:54.081
So you'll never escape.

1:16:57.084 --> 1:16:59.687
There are two ways
out of this for you.

1:17:01.288 --> 1:17:04.125
You can either slowly
starve and freeze to death.

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:09.163
Go to your memories
to keep you company.

1:17:11.866 --> 1:17:13.367
You can take the easy way out.

1:17:14.969 --> 1:17:15.803
You have a knife,

1:17:17.606 --> 1:17:19.874
there's an assortment
of pills in the kitchen

1:17:21.375 --> 1:17:23.969
and we left you a
nice bottle of wine,

1:17:24.011 --> 1:17:25.846
as a farewell present.

1:17:29.618 --> 1:17:31.285
The choice is yours.

1:21:01.328 --> 1:21:02.831
Has she done it?

1:21:05.466 --> 1:21:06.934
We'll find out soon enough.

1:21:34.629 --> 1:21:36.054
What's the matter?

1:21:36.096 --> 1:21:37.931
Not what you expected?

1:21:39.433 --> 1:21:41.126
Surely after all
the fun you've had,

1:21:41.168 --> 1:21:45.038
you should know the reality
isn't what our eyes always see.

1:21:47.174 --> 1:21:47.941
Don't!

1:21:50.411 --> 1:21:51.278
How does it feel?

1:21:52.714 --> 1:21:56.108
To lose control of your
plan at the last moment?

1:21:56.150 --> 1:21:57.786
God, that must be frustrating.

1:21:58.952 --> 1:22:00.513
Plans, I don't know...

1:22:00.555 --> 1:22:02.013
Please.

1:22:02.055 --> 1:22:05.618
All I've heard from you is
lie after lie after lie.

1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:07.762
This time, you're gonna
tell me the truth.

1:22:08.696 --> 1:22:09.888
If you want me to call for help,

1:22:09.930 --> 1:22:11.390
so you don't bleed
out on my floor,

1:22:11.432 --> 1:22:14.092
you're gonna tell me what
exactly happened that night.

1:22:14.134 --> 1:22:15.402
I wanna know all of it.

1:22:19.874 --> 1:22:23.201
We hired a yacht, took you
out into the shallow ends

1:22:23.243 --> 1:22:25.880
off the coast, got out
into the dinghy, snorkeled,

1:22:27.749 --> 1:22:28.683
enjoyed the sun.

1:22:35.723 --> 1:22:38.518
And then on board.

1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:40.027
I remember that.

1:22:41.195 --> 1:22:42.029
Go on.

1:22:43.497 --> 1:22:47.836
And then we spiked your
drinks, the three of you.

1:22:49.671 --> 1:22:53.398
And waited until you
eventually passed out.

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:57.804
I did, I did trip over but
it was over Chloe, wasn't it?

1:22:57.846 --> 1:23:02.750
Yeah.

1:24:21.428 --> 1:24:22.362
And then?

1:24:24.899 --> 1:24:29.904
We went out
deeper into the ocean,

1:24:33.307 --> 1:24:37.512
to some area known for being
infested with great whites.

1:24:39.013 --> 1:24:40.347
We threw you out to sea,

1:24:42.684 --> 1:24:47.689
and left
you for the sharks.

1:24:48.890 --> 1:24:49.791
That's how you cut
your hand, isn't it?

1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:55.120
You got the scar 'cause you
were trying to attract them.

1:24:55.162 --> 1:24:57.990
Yeah, and we slashed the
dinghy and threw it out

1:24:58.032 --> 1:24:59.834
to make it look
like an accident.

1:25:01.234 --> 1:25:03.270
Like you'd
drunk and gone out in it.

1:25:04.906 --> 1:25:06.139
Well, that backfired.

1:25:07.008 --> 1:25:08.676
It ended up saving my life.

1:25:10.011 --> 1:25:12.070
And you know, for
most of the last year,

1:25:12.112 --> 1:25:13.338
I'd been wishing it hadn't.

1:25:13.380 --> 1:25:17.085
But, my God, am I
happy to be alive.

1:25:18.418 --> 1:25:21.514
I'm gonna spend my
life watching you two

1:25:21.556 --> 1:25:24.249
spend the rest of yours
rotting in prison.

1:25:24.291 --> 1:25:25.927
- Don't you dare!
- Wait.

1:25:27.095 --> 1:25:28.930
Wait, I had nothing
to do with this.

1:25:30.932 --> 1:25:32.992
Lexy, I understand you're angry.

1:25:33.034 --> 1:25:35.061
I know how this might look.

1:25:35.103 --> 1:25:37.471
It looks like you're
an accomplice to murder.

1:25:38.873 --> 1:25:41.109
I have nothing
to do with this.

1:25:41.976 --> 1:25:43.210
This was all on you.

1:25:45.113 --> 1:25:47.682
You fucking
roped me into this.

1:25:48.583 --> 1:25:49.775
You're a liar.

1:25:49.817 --> 1:25:50.818
Let him finish.

1:25:52.020 --> 1:25:54.154
This happened way
before I met you, Lex.

1:25:56.124 --> 1:25:56.958
I wasn't...

1:25:59.259 --> 1:26:00.094
I, got on,

1:26:02.730 --> 1:26:06.634
mowing lawns, and cutting
trees, nothing glamorous

1:26:10.538 --> 1:26:14.474
One of the guys whose lawn
I mowed was an old guy.

1:26:18.478 --> 1:26:19.547
Mr. Randall.

1:26:21.415 --> 1:26:23.809
One day, he was
feeling really poorly.

1:26:23.851 --> 1:26:25.811
So he asked me to
go to the pharmacy

1:26:25.853 --> 1:26:27.320
and pick up his prescription.

1:26:29.590 --> 1:26:30.424
So I did.

1:26:34.062 --> 1:26:36.463
Vicky worked behind the
counter at the pharmacy.

1:26:38.465 --> 1:26:42.260
She asked so many questions,
and she was so flirty.

1:26:42.302 --> 1:26:46.174
Said she hoped to see me
again soon.

1:26:50.945 --> 1:26:54.239
Next thing I knew, she turns
up at Mr. Randall's house,

1:26:54.281 --> 1:26:56.184
tells me to get in
the car for a chat.

1:27:01.155 --> 1:27:02.557
That's where it all started.

1:27:04.357 --> 1:27:07.161
A few weeks later,
Mr. Randall was dead.

1:27:11.199 --> 1:27:12.525
He left me some
money in his well.

1:27:12.567 --> 1:27:13.959
Fantastic story.

1:27:14.001 --> 1:27:15.393
What a wonderful
imagination you have.

1:27:15.435 --> 1:27:17.105
Oh, you're fucked.

1:27:18.873 --> 1:27:21.033
Befriending old
vulnerable people

1:27:21.075 --> 1:27:23.511
so you can fuck with
their medication.

1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:28.482
Well, they were
gonna die soon anyway.

1:27:37.759 --> 1:27:40.828
So it was you who
laced the drinks.

1:27:42.964 --> 1:27:44.031
I am sorry.

1:27:45.233 --> 1:27:46.926
It was never meant to go
this far, it was never...

1:27:46.968 --> 1:27:50.029
It's a little
bit late for that.

1:28:15.730 --> 1:28:17.064
You're finished.

1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:40.955
- Get out of my room.
- Shut up!

1:28:42.089 --> 1:28:44.950
Lexy, you don't
believe him, do you?

1:28:44.992 --> 1:28:46.284
It was all his idea.

1:28:46.326 --> 1:28:47.887
Oh, don't lie to me!

1:28:47.929 --> 1:28:50.256
I'm not lying to you, Lexy.

1:28:50.298 --> 1:28:52.792
I never felt
comfortable with you.

1:28:52.834 --> 1:28:54.693
You knew dad had life insurance.

1:28:54.735 --> 1:28:56.162
With the three of
us out of the way,

1:28:56.204 --> 1:28:58.564
you'd have the money and
your house all to yourself.

1:28:58.606 --> 1:29:00.666
No, it wasn't about the money.

1:29:00.708 --> 1:29:01.634
And what?

1:29:01.676 --> 1:29:03.803
Then Isaac came along and,

1:29:03.845 --> 1:29:06.437
maybe that wasn't a
coincidence either.

1:29:06.479 --> 1:29:09.550
And you planned a little
family holiday together.

1:29:10.985 --> 1:29:14.180
You were so insistent on South
Africa, more sharks, right?

1:29:14.222 --> 1:29:16.148
I mean, it makes sense.

1:29:16.190 --> 1:29:18.184
It's not true, it's not true.

1:29:18.226 --> 1:29:22.429
You know what I don't get,
you wanna kill me, right?

1:29:23.564 --> 1:29:26.058
I've been in this house
with you for a year.

1:29:26.100 --> 1:29:27.226
What took you so long?

1:29:27.268 --> 1:29:30.204
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:29:31.339 --> 1:29:34.466
Let's make this
nice and easy, okay?

1:29:34.508 --> 1:29:35.375
What do you want?

1:29:37.078 --> 1:29:39.412
What can I do to make
all this go away?

1:29:47.420 --> 1:29:50.358
I want my dad
and my sister back.

1:29:54.295 --> 1:29:55.529
Lexy, please.

1:30:08.542 --> 1:30:11.646
Okay, there's
something you can do.

1:30:13.948 --> 1:30:16.617
Sign over the deed to the house.

1:30:28.763 --> 1:30:32.124
I had my last session
today with Fran.

1:30:32.166 --> 1:30:33.659
Oh my gosh, that's amazing.

1:30:33.701 --> 1:30:36.762
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:30:36.804 --> 1:30:41.267
So the house, have you decided
what you're doing with it?

1:30:41.309 --> 1:30:44.503
No, I don't think
I can let go of it.

1:30:44.545 --> 1:30:45.771
You're not gonna sell it?

1:30:45.813 --> 1:30:46.739
No.

1:30:46.781 --> 1:30:48.674
What, Lex, you'd make a mint.

1:30:48.716 --> 1:30:53.688
I know, but it was
dad's and grandpa's

1:30:54.889 --> 1:30:56.524
and it meant so
much to them, so.

1:30:58.559 --> 1:31:01.829
So have you heard from
Isaac or Vicky recently?

1:31:04.265 --> 1:31:05.099
Nope.

1:31:07.368 --> 1:31:10.871
And I don't think I will
for a very long time.

1:31:14.175 --> 1:31:16.468
But hey, brighter days ahead.

1:31:16.510 --> 1:31:17.970
Should we do a cheers?

1:31:18.012 --> 1:31:18.846
Okay.

1:31:20.281 --> 1:31:23.976
To a fresh start.

1:31:24.018 --> 1:31:25.978
To a fresh start.

1:31:26.020 --> 1:31:27.546
And more wine.

1:31:27.588 --> 1:31:28.422
Always.
