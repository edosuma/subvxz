WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:02.140
Can I ask you a question?

00:02.234 --> 00:05.156
Is this the worst night we've ever had?

00:05.227 --> 00:06.561
Well, I mean, it was cool that Chase

00:06.633 --> 00:08.367
got to perform at the VMAs.

00:08.435 --> 00:13.539
Yeah. Too bad it ruined
both of our goddamn lives.

00:13.606 --> 00:15.240
Oh.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.443
Wait, why'd you throw my beer?

00:17.510 --> 00:20.913
Because I'm drinking mine.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.948

00:23.016 --> 00:24.516
_

00:24.584 --> 00:28.654
Oh, my God, the VMAs.
This is so glamorous.

00:28.722 --> 00:31.490
Oh, I wish your dad was here
to see Chase's big night.

00:31.558 --> 00:33.559
Yeah, I know. Me too.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.588
Oh, hi. Are you performing tonight too?

00:35.643 --> 00:37.026
Oh, no. I'm just the sound mixer.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.130
Oh. Well, don't worry.

00:38.198 --> 00:40.499
I'm sure you'll be on the show someday.

00:40.567 --> 00:42.901
Um, Mom, how are you doing

00:42.969 --> 00:45.604
with Dad after all the plane stuff?

00:45.672 --> 00:47.339
Oh... well, I'm okay.

00:47.407 --> 00:49.742
Everyone's been very supportive.

00:49.809 --> 00:52.144
People keep telling me
I'm an inspiration.

00:52.212 --> 00:53.946
Aw. Well, that's good. You are.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.547
Now I'm not just
the mother of three kids.

00:55.615 --> 00:56.815
I'm the mother of a movement.

00:56.883 --> 00:59.240
- Oh boy.
- Where is Cary?

00:59.287 --> 01:01.987
- The show's already halfway over.
- I don't know.

01:02.055 --> 01:03.722
I thought he was getting out
of work at 10:00.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.232 --> 01:15.968
Sorry. Just trying to help.
Peas can be so tricky.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.536
Hey, guys!

01:17.604 --> 01:19.338
Guess who we just met in the hallway.

01:19.406 --> 01:21.940
- Kelly Clarkson!
- Oh, I love Kelly.

01:22.008 --> 01:24.877
You know, I lost my virginity
to "Behind These Hazel Eyes."

01:24.944 --> 01:26.812
- Is that long enough ago?
- Who... say what?

01:26.880 --> 01:28.313
Oh, I forgot to give her my email.

01:28.381 --> 01:29.715
Oh. Hey, Brooke. I'm glad you're back.

01:29.783 --> 01:31.350
I need your help to smear some mud

01:31.418 --> 01:33.185
all over... Chase's body.

01:33.253 --> 01:34.553
You can get his butt.

01:34.621 --> 01:35.988
- Ew. What?
- Okay, fine.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.356
- I'll get his butt.
- No, I mean

01:37.424 --> 01:39.258
why are we smearing mud all over him?

01:39.325 --> 01:41.126
Well, you know how Chase is
singing "Stink" tonight?

01:41.194 --> 01:43.095
Yeah, a simple, stripped-down
version of "Stink."

01:43.163 --> 01:44.676
Yeah, well this morning
I had a different idea.

01:44.723 --> 01:45.902
How about instead,

01:45.942 --> 01:47.440
the whole performance is pig-themed

01:47.500 --> 01:49.568
and Chase is dressed like
a stinky little piggy?

01:49.636 --> 01:51.336
Chases likes the idea, right?

01:51.404 --> 01:53.071
- Don't you buddy?
- I guess.

01:53.139 --> 01:54.973
No. This is Chase's
first live performance.

01:55.041 --> 01:56.875
We all agreed that he should
do something simple

01:56.943 --> 01:58.343
that shows off his voice.

01:58.411 --> 02:00.245
Then how do we get PigDreams to trend?

02:00.313 --> 02:02.381
We don't. We're not doing pig stuff.

02:02.449 --> 02:05.784
Oof. Okay, jeez.
All right, give me a second.

02:05.852 --> 02:07.386
Excuse me, ladies.

02:07.454 --> 02:08.720
It looks like we're not gonna
need you anymore.

02:08.788 --> 02:10.222
- What?
- I'm sorry.

02:10.289 --> 02:12.458
Or should I say "sow-rry."

02:12.525 --> 02:14.927
God, Streeter,
can we just stick to the plan?

02:14.994 --> 02:16.795
We want Chase to be taken
seriously tonight.

02:16.863 --> 02:19.031
I hear you, mama. Loud and clear.

02:19.098 --> 02:21.900
Let me just show you one more idea.

02:21.968 --> 02:25.171
Radio City, please,
and I'm kind of in a hurry.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.305
You got it.

02:26.372 --> 02:28.674
<i>I used to feed my cat generic cat food.</i>

02:28.741 --> 02:30.546
<i>- I didn't think she noticed.</i>
- Oh, no.

02:30.624 --> 02:31.701
<i>But guess what?</i>

02:31.778 --> 02:33.412
<i>After she had a big meal,</i>

02:33.480 --> 02:36.515
<i>my friends sure would.</i>

02:38.151 --> 02:39.451
<i>Great party.</i>

02:42.522 --> 02:43.822
<i>Then I found Nature's Grain!</i>

02:43.890 --> 02:45.190
Not to brag,

02:45.258 --> 02:47.292
but my client is in that commercial.

02:49.028 --> 02:51.730
- Skip?
- Cary!

02:51.798 --> 02:54.202
Streeter, is he changed yet?
He's on in 15 minutes.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.467
Okay, uh, Brooke.

02:55.535 --> 02:56.802
I know you didn't want him to be a pig,

02:56.870 --> 02:58.136
and I gotta say

02:58.204 --> 02:59.438
I think I delivered.

02:59.506 --> 03:01.607
Chase.

03:01.674 --> 03:03.642
- Ah!
- What the hell is this?

03:03.710 --> 03:05.344
Well, you gotta see him
with the backup singers.

03:05.411 --> 03:07.212
All together
they're gonna spell "stink."

03:07.280 --> 03:08.747
Actually they're gonna spell "tink"

03:08.815 --> 03:09.948
because there's only three of them.

03:10.016 --> 03:11.149
Streeter, no!

03:11.217 --> 03:12.184
Why does he need all this bullshit

03:12.252 --> 03:13.185
all of the sudden?

03:13.253 --> 03:14.419
If he wears something crazy,

03:14.487 --> 03:16.555
it's all anyone will talk about.

03:16.623 --> 03:18.323
Hey, guys. Just wanted to let you know,

03:18.391 --> 03:20.092
Chase is up next,
right after Katy Perry.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.426
Oh, shit. We have to hurry.

03:21.494 --> 03:23.328
Oh, wait. Is she doing music or comedy?

03:23.396 --> 03:24.863
- Comedy.
- Oh, okay.

03:24.931 --> 03:26.164
- So we have a while.
- Okay.

03:26.232 --> 03:28.000
Let me run one more idea by you,

03:28.067 --> 03:29.134
and I think you're gonna like it

03:29.202 --> 03:30.335
because it's way more subtle.

03:30.403 --> 03:31.970
Yes. That's what we want.

03:32.038 --> 03:33.705
Okay, great. Let's go build it.

03:33.773 --> 03:36.208
What the hell are you doing

03:36.276 --> 03:38.777
driving a cab?
You're supposed to be my agent.

03:38.845 --> 03:40.145
I am, Cary!

03:40.213 --> 03:41.980
Just this morning I was talking

03:42.048 --> 03:43.515
to JJ Abrams about you.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.350
- You were?
- Yes!

03:45.418 --> 03:46.552
I was taking him to the airport.

03:46.619 --> 03:47.853
I couldn't shut up about you.

03:47.921 --> 03:49.321
Oh, my God.

03:49.389 --> 03:50.622
Listen, Skip.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.424
Do you know where I'm headed right now?

03:52.492 --> 03:53.859
The VMAs.

03:53.927 --> 03:56.328
You're performing at the VMAs? Wow!

03:56.396 --> 03:58.330
I guess I'm a better agent
than I thought I was.

03:58.398 --> 04:00.899
No, Skip, I'm not performing
at the VMAs.

04:00.967 --> 04:02.501
My brother is,

04:02.569 --> 04:05.170
and in the same time
it took him to book that,

04:05.238 --> 04:08.373
I've had one fart commercial air

04:08.441 --> 04:10.709
and I'm doing like
a weird straight voice in it.

04:10.777 --> 04:12.477
I just...

04:12.545 --> 04:15.180
I can't have you represent me
anymore, all right?

04:15.248 --> 04:17.382
You're fired. Good-bye.

04:21.788 --> 04:23.755
It's actually a couple more blocks.

04:23.823 --> 04:25.949
You said this was gonna be more subtle!

04:26.011 --> 04:27.225
I did, and it is!

04:27.293 --> 04:30.028
He is wearing a literal
birdcage full of birds.

04:30.096 --> 04:32.030
- But not real birds.
- Oh, my God.

04:32.098 --> 04:33.932
How am I an assistant
and you're a manager?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.534
I should be a manager.

04:35.602 --> 04:37.069
I think there is a real bird in here.

04:37.136 --> 04:38.337
Chase.

04:38.404 --> 04:39.871
- What do you wanna wear?
- Ah...

04:39.939 --> 04:41.206
You wanna wear one of these new ideas

04:41.274 --> 04:42.574
or what we picked out last week?

04:42.642 --> 04:44.409
I guess what we picked out last week,

04:44.477 --> 04:46.211
but can I wear my own shoes?

04:46.279 --> 04:48.080
Sure. You can wear whatever
shoes you want.

04:48.147 --> 04:49.915
This is a bad idea.
I've been thinking about this.

04:49.983 --> 04:51.516
- Let me tell you what...
- Ah, ah! Ah, ah!

04:51.584 --> 04:52.884
Streeter!

04:52.952 --> 04:54.319
- Let me tell you...
- Streeter!

04:54.387 --> 04:55.587
Wouldn't a good manager listen

04:55.655 --> 04:56.888
to what his client wants?

04:56.956 --> 04:58.190
Just let him go out there and sing.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.458
- He's a singer.
- Okay!

04:59.525 --> 05:00.892
Whatever you want, girl boss.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.427
Don't call me that.

05:02.495 --> 05:03.895
Okay, Cary's almost here.

05:03.963 --> 05:05.430
Can you just go out and let him in?

05:05.498 --> 05:07.199
Sure thing. Actually
I do need to speak to him

05:07.266 --> 05:09.034
because I have some news

05:09.102 --> 05:11.970
that will change his...

05:13.272 --> 05:14.640
Excuse me.

05:14.707 --> 05:16.942
I have some news that will...

05:17.010 --> 05:18.677
- Go!
- All right, all right.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.948
It's Cary! We love you, Cary!

05:23.016 --> 05:25.784
Oh-ho! Cary!

05:25.852 --> 05:27.486
Cary, welcome to the VMAs.

05:27.553 --> 05:28.987
I think your cab driver cuts my hair.

05:29.055 --> 05:30.822
Yeah, no, I'm sure he does.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.691
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

05:32.759 --> 05:34.593
Oh, don't worry about it.
Hey, before we go in,

05:34.661 --> 05:36.294
I got something that's gonna
cheer you up.

05:36.362 --> 05:38.797
You know how your brother's
a big huge singer?

05:38.865 --> 05:40.332
Um, yes.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.801
Well, apparently he's such a huge singer

05:42.869 --> 05:44.936
that he gets to be an actor now too.

05:45.004 --> 05:46.471
What?

05:46.539 --> 05:48.340
Yeah. Netflix wants him to do a movie.

05:48.408 --> 05:50.308
He doesn't even have to
audition or anything.

05:50.376 --> 05:51.877
Yeah.

05:51.944 --> 05:53.912
How is that supposed
to make me feel better?

05:53.980 --> 05:55.681
Oh, God.

05:55.748 --> 05:57.482
Aren't gay people supposed
to be smarter?

05:57.550 --> 06:01.153
Isn't that the trade-off?
Cary, you get to be in it too.

06:01.220 --> 06:02.921
- What?
- Yeah.

06:02.989 --> 06:04.990
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

06:05.058 --> 06:06.591
Apparently they're doing
a "Freaky Friday" remake

06:06.659 --> 06:07.993
but with brothers.

06:08.061 --> 06:09.594
They were gonna call it "Bro Swap,"

06:09.662 --> 06:10.929
but then there was
a gay porn called that.

06:10.997 --> 06:11.963
And then they were gonna call it

06:12.031 --> 06:13.065
"My Brother's Inside of Me,"

06:13.132 --> 06:14.132
but there were like a thousand

06:14.200 --> 06:15.801
gay porns called that.

06:15.868 --> 06:17.836
So now it's just "The Untitled
Brothers Switching

06:17.904 --> 06:20.138
Bodies But Not In A Sex Way Project."

06:20.206 --> 06:22.674
Oh. Oh, my God, this is...
this is crazy.

06:22.742 --> 06:24.309
I didn't even know Chase wanted to act.

06:24.377 --> 06:25.711
Neither does he so don't tell him

06:25.778 --> 06:27.512
because I want it to be a surprise.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.947
This is like the best news ever.

06:29.015 --> 06:30.649
Thank you, Streeter.

06:30.717 --> 06:32.250
Yes. Oh, I'm getting
a hug and everything.

06:32.318 --> 06:33.685
All right, let's go inside

06:33.753 --> 06:35.020
because Chase is about to go on soon.

06:35.088 --> 06:37.055
Cary! Tell Chase hi!

06:37.123 --> 06:39.024
- And Brooke and Pat!
- I will.

06:39.092 --> 06:40.826
God, they really do know
all of our names.

06:40.893 --> 06:43.061
I know. But he didn't say my name.

06:43.866 --> 06:46.015
Hey, guys, 60 seconds
back from commercial.

06:46.094 --> 06:48.898
Look at him out there. He's so handsome.

06:48.969 --> 06:50.569
I know. I don't know
what Streeter was thinking.

06:50.632 --> 06:52.351
- Brooke. Brooke, hey.
- Cary!

06:52.437 --> 06:53.734
Oh, my God. This is so cool.

06:53.802 --> 06:55.302
Oh, my God. I thought you
were gonna miss it.

06:55.370 --> 06:58.706
I know. Listen.
You're not gonna believe this.

06:58.774 --> 07:00.508
- I'm gonna be in a movie.
- What?

07:00.575 --> 07:02.243
- You are?
- Yeah. With Chase.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.378
Whoa. You wanna do that?

07:04.446 --> 07:06.680
Yes, it's like a big part
in a real movie.

07:06.748 --> 07:08.516
Anna Kendrick plays our mom.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.551
Debra Messing plays our grandma.

07:10.619 --> 07:12.052
Oh, Debra.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.621
I know I wouldn't have
gotten it without Chase,

07:13.688 --> 07:15.222
but so what?

07:15.290 --> 07:16.624
I think I can be really good in it.

07:16.691 --> 07:18.192
Cary, that is so good!

07:18.260 --> 07:21.495
Aw, my little baby rode the wave.

07:21.563 --> 07:23.831
- 15 seconds.
- Oh, hell yeah, Chase!

07:23.899 --> 07:26.267
- Hell yeah!
- Lance?

07:26.334 --> 07:28.202
- What are you doing here?
- CookBrooke.

07:28.270 --> 07:29.537
Chase wanted to wear my shoes tonight.

07:29.604 --> 07:31.138
- Didn't he tell you?
- Whoa.

07:31.206 --> 07:32.840
Damn, Daniel.

07:32.908 --> 07:35.209
Okay, guys, five seconds. Four.

07:35.277 --> 07:37.411
Three, two...

07:39.247 --> 07:42.716
<i>And now, performing live
for the first time ever,</i>

I just realized I've never
heard him sing live before.

09:27.556 --> 09:29.723
Who let him do this?
He was not ready to do this!

09:29.791 --> 09:31.926
- What is Twitter saying?
- Um, that we're fucked.

09:31.993 --> 09:33.193
Every tweet is bad.

09:33.261 --> 09:34.428
- Oh, no.
- The Burger King account

09:34.496 --> 09:35.829
is, like, ripping him apart.

09:35.897 --> 09:37.364
My son is a good singer, okay?

09:37.432 --> 09:38.866
He just doesn't have an ear for music.

09:38.934 --> 09:40.401
- So what?
- I'm gonna go check on him.

09:40.468 --> 09:42.262
And I'm gonna go yell
at that sound mixer lady.

09:42.325 --> 09:43.270
This is her fault.

09:43.338 --> 09:44.939
If she wasn't trying so hard
to get on the show,

09:45.006 --> 09:46.840
maybe she would have done her damn job.

09:46.908 --> 09:49.710
- Lance, let's go.
- Why am I a part of this?

09:49.778 --> 09:51.679
I don't get it. Why is nobody
making fun of Iggy Azalea?

09:51.746 --> 09:53.847
Her voice sucked too.
You just couldn't tell

09:53.915 --> 09:56.283
'cause she was singing from
the inside of a giant butt.

09:56.351 --> 09:58.352
Oh, wait.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.487
Is that why you wanted Chase
to dress like a pig?

10:00.555 --> 10:02.423
Bingo, mama.

10:02.490 --> 10:05.526
You see, for some singers, it's
all about smoke and mirrors.

10:05.594 --> 10:08.195
I love Chase,
but he needs a lot of smoke

10:08.263 --> 10:10.197
and a lot of mirrors.

10:10.265 --> 10:11.532
Oh, my God.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.300
I am so sorry I didn't trust you.

10:13.368 --> 10:15.701
I was just so mad that you
weren't listening to him.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.334
Well that's what good managers do.

10:17.397 --> 10:18.670
They don't listen to their clients.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.666
Oh, well, let me be
the first to say that you are

10:20.742 --> 10:23.077
- an excellent manager.
- Oh, thank you.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.312
I actually think you'd make
a pretty good one yourself.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.448
- You do?
- Yeah.

10:27.515 --> 10:29.750
Even after tonight? Why?

10:29.818 --> 10:31.418
Well, earlier tonight you screamed

10:31.486 --> 10:33.487
"I should be a manager!"
even though you have

10:33.555 --> 10:36.423
absolutely no managerial
training or experience,

10:36.491 --> 10:40.527
and that is how every great
manager gets their start.

10:40.595 --> 10:43.430
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

10:43.498 --> 10:45.165
Well, you clearly care about Chase

10:45.233 --> 10:48.569
and I could use a little bit
more help with the DreamTeam.

10:48.637 --> 10:50.704
Especially, uh, now.

10:50.772 --> 10:53.841
So... you in?

10:53.908 --> 10:57.711
What, like... be a manager?

10:57.779 --> 10:59.980
Yes! Oh, my God, yes! Thank you!

11:00.048 --> 11:01.382
Streeter, thank you. I mean...

11:01.449 --> 11:03.283
And I promise I'll make up for tonight.

11:03.343 --> 11:05.556
Great. Hey, should I make us
DreamTeam jackets?

11:05.610 --> 11:06.620
No.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.559
Cary! Hi, Cary!

11:12.627 --> 11:15.529
What are you doing?
You like my sign, Cary?

11:15.597 --> 11:17.731
You're my favorite!

11:17.799 --> 11:20.434
Cary, you're my favorite!

11:28.943 --> 11:31.478
Hey, buddy. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

11:31.546 --> 11:34.448
- Hey, Cary.
- Jesus Christ!

11:34.516 --> 11:37.384
Oh. What is this mask?

11:37.452 --> 11:39.453
I have to wear it whenever
I'm outside now.

11:39.521 --> 11:41.088
Streeter says if I don't,

11:41.156 --> 11:42.956
the fans will try to fuck me.

11:43.024 --> 11:44.658
Oh, my God.

11:44.726 --> 11:47.327
Well, I just, um,

11:47.395 --> 11:51.165
I just came over to say
great job on your song.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.801
Yeah right.

11:53.868 --> 11:55.703
Is everyone mad at me?

11:55.770 --> 11:59.006
Mad at you? No, no.

11:59.074 --> 12:01.575
We're all so impressed by you.

12:01.643 --> 12:04.178
- Really?
- Yes.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.980
You know, like, every day.

12:07.048 --> 12:10.084
I never could have handled

12:10.151 --> 12:11.985
being this famous when I was 14.

12:12.053 --> 12:15.622
And trust me,
I, uh... I really wanted to,

12:15.690 --> 12:18.225
like really wanted to be.

12:19.728 --> 12:21.895
I'm just not having any fun.

12:21.963 --> 12:24.798
What?

12:24.866 --> 12:27.668
Your life is so fun.

12:27.736 --> 12:29.636
I guess.

12:29.704 --> 12:31.438
Well...

12:31.506 --> 12:35.676
You can always talk to me
and Brooke about anything,

12:35.744 --> 12:38.879
and we will always listen to you, okay?

12:38.947 --> 12:41.348
Besides, I know for a fact

12:41.416 --> 12:44.918
you got some pretty fun stuff coming up.

12:44.986 --> 12:48.722
Let's just say you might get to
work with your favorite actor.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.357
- Logan Paul?
- No.

12:50.425 --> 12:52.659
- No. Actor.
- Jake Paul?

12:52.727 --> 12:56.530
No, act... you know what? Never mind.

12:56.598 --> 12:58.832
Hi.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.501
BrookeDreams! Hi, Brooke!

13:00.568 --> 13:02.136
Hi. Thank you.

13:02.203 --> 13:03.937
- Lance! Hi, Lance.
- What up, bro?

13:04.005 --> 13:06.807
I love you, Lance!

13:06.875 --> 13:08.675
We love you, Streeter.

13:08.743 --> 13:11.145
Oh! I love you too!

13:11.212 --> 13:13.413
Streeter! Streeter!

13:13.481 --> 13:16.950
Streeter! Streeter! Streeter! Streeter!

13:17.018 --> 13:20.984
Manager? Damn, B. You are a badass.

13:22.157 --> 13:24.383
Your shoes were on TV, so are you!

13:24.453 --> 13:28.195
We're just two badasses in the city.

13:28.263 --> 13:29.897
Yeah.

13:29.964 --> 13:31.665
Hey, um...

13:31.733 --> 13:35.636
I know things got kind
of bad between us.

13:35.703 --> 13:39.173
You know, I think we just
needed time apart to...

13:39.240 --> 13:41.942
chase dreams.

13:42.010 --> 13:45.279
But being away from you

13:45.346 --> 13:48.448
God, I wish it was snowing right now.

13:48.516 --> 13:52.319
Um, it's made me realize how
much I want to be with you.

13:53.922 --> 13:55.322
I'm ready.

13:57.025 --> 13:58.759
To come home.

14:00.428 --> 14:02.262
CookBrooke.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.264
What?

14:04.332 --> 14:07.134
I don't think we should do this.

14:07.202 --> 14:09.169
Oh. No, I'm sorry.

14:09.237 --> 14:11.405
I'm ready to be together now, so we are.

14:11.472 --> 14:12.940
I just feel like I've been doing

14:13.007 --> 14:15.342
pretty well on my own lately.

14:16.578 --> 14:18.579
Well then why'd you let me say

14:18.646 --> 14:20.547
all that gross shit about "coming home?"

14:20.615 --> 14:22.349
Sorry, Brooke. I'm sorry. I...

14:25.620 --> 14:28.188
Brooke, I love you, but I just can't.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.949
I want to make a toast to Chase

14:46.028 --> 14:48.185
on his big VMA performance

14:48.247 --> 14:49.693
no matter what Burger King says.

14:49.748 --> 14:51.282
- No.
- Where is Chase?

14:51.358 --> 14:54.193
Oh, uh, he's over there
talking to Michael Che.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.761
The grind never stops.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.130
But Chase isn't the only one
I'm proud of.

14:58.198 --> 15:02.668
To my CareBear, who's gonna be
in a big, fancy Hollywood movie

15:02.736 --> 15:05.938
with Chase called "Debra's Missing!"

15:06.006 --> 15:07.807
Nope. Uh, it's not called
"Debra's Missing."

15:07.875 --> 15:10.576
It stars Debra Messing, but thank you.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.646
And Brookey, little Miss Manager!

15:13.714 --> 15:16.582
To think that six months ago,
I would cry myself to sleep

15:16.650 --> 15:19.685
so worried about you,
but look at you now!

15:19.753 --> 15:22.655
Aw, thanks, Mom. Always great at toasts.

15:22.723 --> 15:24.957
Pat, why don't you tell them
your big career news.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.159
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's nothing.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.629
Tonight is about my kids.
Oh, wait, where's Lance?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.764
I wanted to toast his shoes.

15:31.832 --> 15:34.901
Oh, um... He couldn't make it.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.769
Aw, that's too bad.

15:36.837 --> 15:38.271
Is everything okay?

15:38.338 --> 15:39.972
What? Oh.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.608
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.777
Hi, can I get a card for the table?

15:44.845 --> 15:46.612
Oh, you can just put
it under Billy Eichner.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.614
- Of course.
- Actually, no.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.118
I'm a proud, single businesswoman.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.120
You can put it under Brooke Dubek.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.588
- Of course.
- Actually, no.

15:55.656 --> 15:57.089
Guys, it's really busy tonight.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.624
I love this family.

15:58.692 --> 16:02.962
And I hope to always be a part of it.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.065
So take this and put it on my card.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.000
Of course, Mr. Peters.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.469
Wait. Your name is...

16:10.537 --> 16:12.405
Streeter Peters?

16:12.472 --> 16:13.706
Yes.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.312
- Hey, guys.
- Chase.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.314
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

16:21.381 --> 16:23.616
I'm glad you're all here
because I've been thinking

16:23.684 --> 16:25.351
and I have a big announcement.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.954
All this singing stuff
has been really cool,

16:28.021 --> 16:29.488
but this fall

16:29.556 --> 16:31.624
I'm gonna go

16:31.692 --> 16:33.693
to college.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.696
- What?
- College?

16:53.547 --> 16:55.982
Streeter.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.883
I am... oh, God. I'm so sorry.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.552
I, uh...

16:59.620 --> 17:01.621
I thought he said he was gonna
go to college.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.922
- I did.
- Ah!

17:02.990 --> 17:04.056
I was talking to Michael Che

17:04.124 --> 17:05.558
about what's next for my career

17:05.626 --> 17:07.460
and he said maybe
I should go to college.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.528
So I think I'm gonna go.

17:09.596 --> 17:13.232
Okay, so you're just...
not gonna be a singer anymore?

17:13.300 --> 17:14.599
I guess not

17:14.667 --> 17:16.368
'cause I'd be in college.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.869
Well, I think that's great, honey.

17:17.938 --> 17:19.739
Yeah, yeah. So do I.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.173
I think it's great. I think it's great.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.108
But, um, you know...

17:23.175 --> 17:25.678
Here's an idea.
How about we sleep on it?

17:25.746 --> 17:27.880
And if you still want to go
tomorrow, we can apply then.

17:27.948 --> 17:30.716
I don't need to apply.
I already got into NYU.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.351
- What?
- Oh, Cary,

17:32.419 --> 17:34.820
- like you, almost.
- Yeah, I tweeted at them,

17:34.888 --> 17:38.224
- and they said I could come.
- Oh.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.427
Well, uh, what about all the
cool stuff you have coming up?

17:41.495 --> 17:42.695
- Yeah.
- Streeter.

17:42.763 --> 17:43.896
He got you a movie.

17:43.964 --> 17:45.264
I don't want to do a movie.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.800
I wanna go to college.

17:47.868 --> 17:50.236
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.238
Yeah, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.407
Yeah, yeah. Yas, yas.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.043
- Yeah, yas, queen. Yeah.
- Yeah, it's great.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.577
You know, it's so great.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.681
I'm gonna go thank Michael myself.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.252
Excuse me, hi. Mr. Che?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.920
- Hey.
- Did you just, um,

18:07.988 --> 18:09.588
tell my brother, Chase, that
he should go to college?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.457
Yeah, I thought that'd
probably be the best thing

18:11.525 --> 18:12.925
- for him to do.
- Yeah, well,

18:12.993 --> 18:14.760
as his sister, I just wanted to say

18:14.828 --> 18:17.763
I agree because I think
education is important.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.099
- Well, that's great.
- But as his manager,

18:20.167 --> 18:22.435
I just... I wanna say
you're a real piece of shit.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.869
Whoa.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.404
Where did that come from? Why?

18:25.472 --> 18:27.540
Why? Because I have finally figured out

18:27.607 --> 18:29.008
what it is that I wanna do with my life

18:29.076 --> 18:31.410
and what I'm good at and you come along

18:31.478 --> 18:33.145
and you fucked me.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.114
I mean, not like that.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.183
- I mean, unless...
- No, definitely not.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.452
It's just, of course
I want him to go to college

18:39.519 --> 18:41.487
if that's what he wants to do.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.222
But...

18:43.290 --> 18:45.825
but what about me?
Like, what am I supposed to do?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.793
I mean, you can go to college too.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.662
Jesus, what do you work for college?

18:49.730 --> 18:51.430
- All right.
- Listen.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.365
Michael Che, you seem like a good guy.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.967
I mean, I'm fine. I don't...

18:55.035 --> 18:58.003
But you took something from me tonight.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.473
And you took something
from my brother Cary.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.110
So, I'm gonna take something from you.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.011
Yeah, I'm gonna...

19:06.079 --> 19:08.347
I'm gonna take your drinks.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.949
I'm taking these.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.951
- They're mine now.
- Yeah.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.323
Thinking of killing yourself?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.325
What? No.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.660
If it wasn't for
the hot new lady in my life

19:21.728 --> 19:24.563
I'd be dead in the bathroom already.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.198
Ew. "Hot lady"?

19:26.266 --> 19:29.168
She doesn't want me
to tell anybody, yet.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.070
But let's just say

19:31.138 --> 19:33.372
she's a very special woman.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.775
- You don't know her.
- I'm sure I don't, Streeter.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.376
She's a beautiful woman,

19:37.444 --> 19:40.579
and she raised three beautiful children.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.414
- Again, you don't know her.
- Okay, Streeter.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.550
I hope that someday
me and this beautiful woman,

19:44.618 --> 19:46.418
who you do not know...

19:46.486 --> 19:48.053
can take it to the next level.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.022
Please don't talk
about you two having sex.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.757
I'm talking about marriage, man.

19:51.825 --> 19:53.225
- Oh, God.
- I'm talking about marriage.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.927
We already had sex.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.857
- You wanna get out of here?
- Fuck yes.

20:02.647 --> 20:05.264
Ew, what? They're sleeping together?

20:05.334 --> 20:07.224
Yep. This bitch's "year of yes"

20:07.287 --> 20:08.888
has gone way too far.

20:08.927 --> 20:10.823
Ugh.

20:10.891 --> 20:12.725
Can I ask you a question?

20:12.793 --> 20:15.351
Is this the worst night we've ever had?

20:15.430 --> 20:16.730
Well, I mean, it was cool that Chase

20:16.798 --> 20:18.599
got to perform at the VMAs.

20:18.666 --> 20:23.570
Yeah. Too bad it ruined both
of our goddamn lives.

20:23.638 --> 20:25.372
Oh.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.674
Wait, why'd you throw my beer?

20:27.742 --> 20:30.444
Because I'm drinking mine.

20:32.113 --> 20:34.815
Oh, this is empty.

20:34.883 --> 20:36.016
God.

20:36.084 --> 20:37.317
Can you believe I was in a movie

20:37.385 --> 20:38.886
for three whole hours?

20:38.953 --> 20:40.888
Maybe Chase will change his mind.

20:40.955 --> 20:42.522
I just think I'm done.

20:42.590 --> 20:45.659
I've tried everything,
and nothing is working.

20:45.727 --> 20:47.728
No. Don't talk like that.

20:47.795 --> 20:51.832
I just need to move somewhere and do...

20:51.900 --> 20:54.067
whatever the male equivalent
of having a baby is.

20:54.135 --> 20:55.535
A web series?

20:55.603 --> 20:57.337
- Ugh.
- You know what?

20:57.405 --> 20:58.705
No.

20:58.773 --> 21:01.808
No, what if... what if this is good?

21:01.876 --> 21:03.277
Yeah, I think this will be good for us,

21:03.344 --> 21:04.878
- Car.
- You do?

21:04.946 --> 21:07.180
I mean, I have to
or I will literally barf,

21:07.248 --> 21:11.685
but, yeah, might be nice
to just get back to normal,

21:11.753 --> 21:13.654
not have anyone famous in the family.

21:13.721 --> 21:15.055
Maybe you're right.

21:15.123 --> 21:16.628
It's probably healthier for Chase.

21:16.714 --> 21:17.758
Yeah.

21:17.825 --> 21:20.127
Oh, what do you think
Mom's career news was?

21:20.194 --> 21:21.261
Who knows.

21:29.836 --> 21:31.406
<i>Her husband may have froze,</i>

21:31.469 --> 21:33.390
<i>but she's just heating up.</i>

21:33.468 --> 21:35.531
<i>This fall, America's favorite mom</i>

21:35.586 --> 21:37.751
<i>is moving to daytime, with "Pat!"</i>

21:37.822 --> 21:41.892
My son chased his dreams,
and now I'm chasing mine.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.295
<i>"Pat!" Weekdays at 4:00.</i>

21:44.627 --> 21:47.080
- Chris is rockin' some cool kicks.
- That is interesting

21:47.118 --> 21:48.321
- that I do have cool shoes.
- It's good, that is interesting.

21:48.346 --> 21:49.602
- I think that's probably a really good place
- Yeah, that's a good ending.

21:49.627 --> 21:51.089
- to leave the season.
- Yeah.

21:52.932 --> 21:55.903
Hey everybody, welcome to
The Other Show. I'm Sarah.

21:55.904 --> 21:58.337
- And I'm Chris.
- We're here talking about the finale

21:58.338 --> 22:01.048
of The Other Two with
Case, Helene, and Drew.

22:01.073 --> 22:02.017
- Hi, you guys.
- Whoo!

22:02.042 --> 22:03.048
Hello!

22:03.073 --> 22:04.778
- The season's over.
- We made it.

22:04.779 --> 22:07.245
- The season's over.
- A whole season, I can't believe it.

22:07.246 --> 22:09.114
You said this was gonna be more subtle!

22:09.115 --> 22:10.616
I did, and it is!

22:10.617 --> 22:13.251
He is wearing a literal
birdcage full of birds.

22:13.252 --> 22:14.852
But not real birds!

22:14.853 --> 22:16.822
It was actually really
fun to come to work

22:16.823 --> 22:18.082
and see what you were gonna be

22:18.106 --> 22:19.825
- wearing every episode.
- Yeah, you were like, "I'm excited for it."

22:19.826 --> 22:21.459
'Cause you had some amazing wardrobe.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.471
Yeah, it was cool.

22:22.496 --> 22:24.362
A couple days before we
did all the costumes,

22:24.363 --> 22:26.364
they bring all the costumes to my house

22:26.365 --> 22:27.299
and I tried 'em all on.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.315
And I'm like, "Okay."

22:28.340 --> 22:30.102
Yeah, Jill Bream did the costumes.

22:30.103 --> 22:32.270
And is incredible, and
does costumes at SNL, too.

22:32.271 --> 22:33.839
And then sometimes she
would show us something,

22:33.840 --> 22:35.608
and we were like, "I don't know what..."

22:35.609 --> 22:36.874
And she was like, "Trust me,

22:36.875 --> 22:38.309
"when it's on him, it'll be correct."

22:38.310 --> 22:39.315
And it always was.

22:39.340 --> 22:41.214
- My favorite was the Versace look,
- Yeah.

22:41.215 --> 22:42.715
- with all the gold chains.
- Oh, yeah!

22:42.716 --> 22:44.518
Episode eight, and like the
crazy jacket on the plane.

22:44.519 --> 22:45.716
At the club, yeah, yeah.

22:45.717 --> 22:47.385
The birdcage outfit was funny, too.

22:47.386 --> 22:48.447
I didn't know what to expect for that.

22:48.472 --> 22:50.307
They were like, "You're gonna wear a
birdcage." And I'm like, "What?!"

22:50.332 --> 22:54.027
<i>And now, performing live
for the first time ever,</i>

22:54.028 --> 22:56.561
<i>give it up for Chase Dreams.</i>

22:56.562 --> 22:59.731
Whoever does that VMA VO is like...

22:59.732 --> 23:01.448
- The actual...
- Yeah, the woman who does the...

23:01.473 --> 23:03.745
- Yeah, it's like... "And now..."
- The actual woman did it?

23:03.784 --> 23:07.573
Was so good, it feels very real.

23:07.574 --> 23:09.141
- Yeah, she was great.
- Yeah, we did it with her,

23:09.142 --> 23:10.909
and she did a couple, and
she was like, "Any notes?"

23:10.910 --> 23:12.492
And we were like,
"No, that's what it is!"

23:12.517 --> 23:13.421
Yeah!

23:13.446 --> 23:17.082
♪ Dancin' 'til we stink ♪

23:17.083 --> 23:19.084
♪ Ain't a party 'til you reek ♪

23:19.085 --> 23:23.421
♪ So dance until you stink ♪

23:23.422 --> 23:26.391
This episode was
Chase's big performance.

23:26.392 --> 23:27.405
Yep, yep.

23:27.430 --> 23:28.894
We went to the studio with Case,

23:28.895 --> 23:31.430
and recorded that song,
and then tweaked it.

23:31.431 --> 23:33.122
Yep, and then we
tweaked it a little bit.

23:33.147 --> 23:35.433
I know it was very weird to be like,

23:35.434 --> 23:38.936
"We need you to sound
bad, but not comedy bad.

23:38.937 --> 23:40.171
"Believable bad."

23:40.172 --> 23:41.106
- So you had to...
- Yeah, can't be like

23:41.107 --> 23:42.540
a goofy bad, it can't be like

23:42.541 --> 23:43.775
it's obvious you're missing notes.

23:43.776 --> 23:45.177
It has to be natural, a little bit.

23:45.178 --> 23:46.112
Yeah, so we had to record it,

23:46.113 --> 23:47.713
and have you kind of miss notes.

23:47.714 --> 23:49.149
- Yeah, kinda miss notes.
- And then try some

23:49.174 --> 23:50.368
- where you'd sing it well.
- Push it a little bit.

23:50.393 --> 23:51.882
- And then we would mess it up.
- Yep.

23:51.883 --> 23:53.753
- Yeah.
- Was that bizarre to do?

23:53.754 --> 23:55.087
It was, when I went in there,

23:55.088 --> 23:56.522
I didn't really know what to expect.

23:56.523 --> 23:57.888
But I was like, "Okay, I kinda..."

23:57.889 --> 24:00.726
'Cause I've seen people in real life,

24:00.727 --> 24:02.094
you know, mess up on awards shows.

24:02.095 --> 24:03.029
Yeah.

24:03.030 --> 24:04.530
And it's like, it's still good,

24:04.531 --> 24:06.065
but it's like, "Nah, that wasn't right."

24:06.066 --> 24:08.367
It wasn't, in my opinion
when I was in there,

24:08.368 --> 24:09.935
I was like, "Oh, it's
not that hard to do."

24:09.936 --> 24:11.536
But it was weird to do.

24:11.537 --> 24:12.970
It wasn't hard, it was
just weird, you know?

24:12.971 --> 24:14.472
Yeah, we wanted it to be just,

24:14.473 --> 24:17.142
- almost imperceptibly off.
- Subtle.

24:17.143 --> 24:19.143
I feel like if Chris or
I performed on a show.

24:19.144 --> 24:21.213
No way, I'd be way worse!

24:21.214 --> 24:23.093
Are you kidding? I don't even
have anything to start with.

24:23.118 --> 24:24.711
What is Twitter saying?

24:24.736 --> 24:26.118
Um, that we're [beep].

24:26.119 --> 24:27.585
Every Tweet is bad.

24:27.586 --> 24:29.754
The Burger King account is,
like, ripping him apart.

24:29.755 --> 24:31.256
My son is a good singer, okay?

24:31.257 --> 24:32.725
He just doesn't have an ear for music.

24:32.726 --> 24:33.770
So what?!

24:33.809 --> 24:35.594
Have either of you
guys biffed it so hard

24:35.595 --> 24:36.663
live, or anything?

24:36.664 --> 24:37.929
I have.

24:37.930 --> 24:40.165
I did Wicked on the
road, and a couple times

24:40.166 --> 24:42.734
went up on my line in
front of barn houses

24:42.735 --> 24:44.001
- with like 4,000 people.
- Well that's especially crazy

24:44.002 --> 24:45.337
because then you've done
that show 1,000 times,

24:45.338 --> 24:46.605
and you're like, "How can I randomly..."

24:46.606 --> 24:48.474
Well, if you've done a show 1,000 times,

24:48.475 --> 24:50.841
you start to like,
while you're doing it,

24:50.842 --> 24:52.707
your brain can go so
many different places.

24:52.732 --> 24:53.846
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you've said

24:53.871 --> 24:55.513
- those words so many times
- Yeah.

24:55.514 --> 24:56.699
that you're thinking
about something else,

24:56.724 --> 24:57.744
and then you're like, "Oh my God,

24:57.769 --> 24:59.150
"I forgot about Helene on Earth.

24:59.151 --> 25:00.980
"She needs to remember what's
coming out of her face."

25:01.005 --> 25:02.293
Whoa, that's trippy.

25:02.318 --> 25:03.288
And then if you start to be like,

25:03.289 --> 25:04.376
"I've done this so many times,

25:04.401 --> 25:05.603
"I wonder what would
happen if I forgot it.

25:05.628 --> 25:06.587
"What would happen if I forgot it?

25:06.612 --> 25:07.547
"What would happen if I forgot it?"

25:07.572 --> 25:08.939
And then you're like, gah!

25:08.964 --> 25:11.964
I haven't really acted since college,

25:11.965 --> 25:13.766
like every gay person.

25:13.767 --> 25:15.032
But I still have dreams

25:15.033 --> 25:16.368
to this day of like, going up on a line.

25:16.369 --> 25:17.536
Have you biffed it hard?

25:17.537 --> 25:19.304
Yes, yes.

25:19.305 --> 25:20.439
And that's the end of that answer?

25:20.440 --> 25:21.374
That's it.

25:21.375 --> 25:22.840
Many times, still happening.

25:22.841 --> 25:24.595
All of my YouTube videos are biffs.

25:25.580 --> 25:27.546
Oh, what do you think
Mom's career news was?

25:27.547 --> 25:28.547
Who knows.

25:32.772 --> 25:33.849
We were trying to figure out

25:33.874 --> 25:36.723
how to end this season for
a while, and we were curious

25:36.724 --> 25:39.524
about how to keep the
premise of The Other Two,

25:39.525 --> 25:41.292
you feeling like the others.

25:41.293 --> 25:42.487
So we came up with the idea

25:42.512 --> 25:46.498
that Molly would be famous
now, that Pat, the mom would...

25:46.499 --> 25:47.698
You kind of slowly but surely,

25:47.699 --> 25:48.993
you see, like, "Oh, it makes sense,

25:49.018 --> 25:50.903
"she has been taking advantage
of all these opportunities."

25:50.904 --> 25:52.071
I loved that teaser at the end.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.405
I would watch Pat.

25:53.406 --> 25:54.572
Especially 'cause it's like

25:54.573 --> 25:55.541
- Molly just being Molly.
- I would too, yeah.

25:55.542 --> 25:57.447
- I was like, "Yeah, I'd watch that."
- I do think this looks real.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.322
- Yeah, that's good.
- Molly Shannon on a talk show?

25:59.347 --> 26:01.412
And I was like, "Why
isn't this a real thing?

26:01.413 --> 26:02.923
- "Let's make this a real thing."
- Yeah, let's do this.

26:02.948 --> 26:05.184
I'm glad you're all here,
because I've been thinking,

26:05.185 --> 26:07.218
and I have a big announcement.

26:07.219 --> 26:09.588
All this singing stuff
has been really cool.

26:09.589 --> 26:12.192
But this fall, I'm gonna go...

26:13.158 --> 26:14.260
to college.

26:15.279 --> 26:16.529
What?

26:16.530 --> 26:18.095
In this episode, you two

26:18.096 --> 26:20.698
become even more connected to Chase.

26:20.699 --> 26:23.734
And you hold their future in your hands,

26:23.735 --> 26:24.936
and you don't know it.

26:24.937 --> 26:26.104
Yeah, you don't know
that she's your manager,

26:26.105 --> 26:27.439
and that he's your co-star.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.453
Well, I'm so innocent.
I'm like, "What's goin' on?

26:29.478 --> 26:32.078
"Oh, their whole lives are
depending on me? What?!"

26:32.103 --> 26:33.047
- Yeah.
- We think it's interesting

26:33.072 --> 26:35.681
moving forward if he has said
he doesn't wanna do this anymore.

26:35.682 --> 26:37.842
And if the family makes him,

26:37.867 --> 26:39.951
- or doesn't make him, or...
- Yeah.

26:39.952 --> 26:41.253
You guys all need him in a way, now.

26:41.254 --> 26:42.520
- Where that is tricky.
- Mm-hmm.

26:42.521 --> 26:44.513
Where it's like, that was never
your intention going into it.

26:44.538 --> 26:46.067
I dunno, that kinda stuff
would be interesting, of like...

26:46.092 --> 26:47.082
And then I don't wanna do this stuff,

26:47.107 --> 26:48.505
but they're kind like, "No, you have to.

26:48.530 --> 26:49.942
"Please just do this one thing for us."

26:49.967 --> 26:51.042
That you're the breadwinner.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.513
Like you are the reason that everyone

26:52.538 --> 26:54.386
has the things they have accidentally.

26:54.411 --> 26:56.134
Yeah, that's one of
the reasons we have you

26:56.135 --> 26:57.936
be like, "Brooke and I
will always listen to you."

26:57.937 --> 26:59.472
'Cause it does set up this premise

26:59.473 --> 27:00.771
that he's your little brother,

27:00.772 --> 27:01.907
and you guys will listen to him.

27:01.908 --> 27:03.554
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And then immediately, that's tested.

27:03.579 --> 27:05.210
I wonder if they'll rise to the occas'.

27:05.211 --> 27:07.078
- We'll see!
- Or be garbage people.
