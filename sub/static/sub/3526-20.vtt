01:52.205 --> 01:54.740
Fuck you doing? Scared
the piss out of me.

01:54.741 --> 01:58.243
Some things you don't
get into over the phone.

01:58.244 --> 02:01.413
Got it.
Lorraine's at mass.

02:01.414 --> 02:03.348
Watch out for Spencer.

02:03.349 --> 02:06.919
- Who?
- Her fucking toy terrier's a shit machine.

02:10.824 --> 02:13.425
I talked to some of the
guys about your misgivings.

02:13.426 --> 02:14.993
Yeah?

02:52.065 --> 02:54.133
Listen,
I've made a decision.

02:56.369 --> 02:59.738
Take a walk in there.

02:59.738 --> 03:02.070
What the fuck you waiting for? Get lost.

03:07.381 --> 03:10.288
Historically, Carmine
always said the sopranos

03:10.284 --> 03:12.881
Are nothing more
than a glorified crew.

03:12.889 --> 03:16.080
Plain and simple,
we decapitate

03:16.089 --> 03:18.092
And we do business
with whatever's left.

03:19.957 --> 03:21.962
- What?
- Nothing.

03:21.966 --> 03:24.162
I agree in spirit,
but I gotta counsel.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.490
This thing should have
been done during John's era.

03:26.496 --> 03:28.763
They got redundant
upper management--

03:28.765 --> 03:30.561
Bleeds off
half the kick.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.571
We take 'em out, absorb
the whole fucking thing.

03:33.578 --> 03:36.103
Take out an entire
fucking family?

03:36.107 --> 03:38.173
Let me tell you
a couple or three things:

03:38.177 --> 03:41.073
Forget coco.
Forget fat Dom

03:41.086 --> 03:43.780
Who goes over to Jersey
and never comes back.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.910
Forget my brother Billy.

03:45.918 --> 03:48.453
Phil, Phil, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.723
Anthony Soprano has
no respect for this thing.

03:51.726 --> 03:54.693
He's never been
in the can, not really.

03:54.696 --> 03:58.332
He's a guy who stepped over his
own uncle to grab the big seat--

03:58.338 --> 04:00.261
His father's brother.

04:00.266 --> 04:02.503
- Please, huh?
- I'm embarrassed.

04:02.506 --> 04:04.703
I let him come to the
hospital last Christmas

04:04.705 --> 04:07.102
And I took his fat
fucking hand in friendship.

04:07.105 --> 04:09.270
Philly, you had
a heart attack.

04:09.276 --> 04:12.970
Listen to me. They make anybody
and everybody over there.

04:12.978 --> 04:15.510
And the way that they
do it is all fucked up.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.613
Guys don't get
their finger pricked.

04:17.616 --> 04:19.452
There's no sword
and gun on the table.

04:19.457 --> 04:21.322
- Phil.
- No, alb.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.050
Either it has meaning
or no meaning.

04:24.057 --> 04:27.791
And the Vito thing--
The man harbors a faggot.

04:27.796 --> 04:30.123
- It's true.
- Five fucking families

04:30.125 --> 04:33.131
And we got this other
pygmy thing over in Jersey.

04:37.237 --> 04:39.673
There's no scraps
in my scrapbook.

04:43.076 --> 04:46.243
Make it happen.

04:56.027 --> 04:59.891
I like the way she played
basketball yesterday.

04:59.896 --> 05:02.193
Almost got my first
hard-On in, like, a month.

05:02.195 --> 05:05.933
Jesus, what's the meaning
of quiet time around here?

05:22.687 --> 05:23.310
Almost got my first
hard-On in, like, a month.

05:23.317 --> 05:25.852
- Rhiannon?
- A.J.?

05:25.858 --> 05:28.151
Jesus.

05:31.356 --> 05:34.123
What are you doing here?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.420
You first.

05:36.427 --> 05:39.463
I have some food issues,
depression.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.862
- You keep up with hernan?
- He's a fucking slimeball.

05:41.866 --> 05:44.600
I caught him finger-Banging
my cousin on the ski lift.

05:44.607 --> 05:46.202
Well, somebody said
you were modeling.

05:46.206 --> 05:48.600
Yeah, I guess.

05:48.608 --> 05:50.643
I signed with elite.

05:50.647 --> 05:53.310
So you would say he's
responding to the therapy.

05:53.318 --> 05:56.342
Well, we don't do
traditional therapy per se.

05:56.348 --> 05:59.480
Kids in crisis mostly need
an environment of calm,

05:59.486 --> 06:00.880
No stresses.

06:00.886 --> 06:04.380
Do you want this? Or I
can pop it in the mail.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.263
Just one more week
of this.

06:13.937 --> 06:15.930
$2,200 a fucking day.

06:42.698 --> 06:45.432
Gabagool', provolone

06:45.438 --> 06:48.862
And vinegar peppers.

06:59.716 --> 07:02.883
You believe this
fucking weather?

07:02.887 --> 07:06.483
End times, huh?
Ready for the rapture.

07:06.485 --> 07:09.820
How's the antiterror
going?

07:09.827 --> 07:13.423
Great if you don't like sleeping,
eating or seeing your kids.

07:17.295 --> 07:20.463
Listen, those arabs
from the bing--

07:20.466 --> 07:21.963
- Mm-Hmm.
- Let me ask you the truth.

07:21.966 --> 07:24.302
They're in jordan, right,
getting their balls zapped?

07:25.605 --> 07:27.331
You're not gonna tell me?

07:27.348 --> 07:29.703
I'm not really sure.
For all we know,

07:29.706 --> 07:32.140
They may be harmless
pistachio salesmen.

07:32.148 --> 07:35.482
Don't get so bent out of
shape. You're a big boy, Tony.

07:35.485 --> 07:38.713
You know, world war ii,
your outfit protected

07:38.717 --> 07:40.710
The Brooklyn navy yard.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.823
You think roosevelt
told Vito genovese

07:42.827 --> 07:45.890
- Where hitler was holed up?
- Go fuck yourself.

07:58.307 --> 08:00.872
Tony, Tony, hold up.

08:00.878 --> 08:02.740
Tony.

08:02.745 --> 08:04.741
What?

08:04.746 --> 08:08.513
Look, I appreciate what you
did giving us those names.

08:08.517 --> 08:11.351
In fact, I've been
sitting here thinking...

08:13.686 --> 08:16.650
remember that thing I told you
about that was supposed to happen

08:16.657 --> 08:19.251
About a year ago,
your problem with Brooklyn?

08:20.696 --> 08:22.722
It's on again possibly.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.531
You, maybe people
close to you.

08:27.535 --> 08:29.531
If it was real solid, you would
have been warned officially

08:29.538 --> 08:31.870
By the newark office,
but my colleague in Brooklyn,

08:31.877 --> 08:34.470
The one
with the collaborator,

08:34.477 --> 08:36.640
Snitch is implying the wheels
have already been set in motion.

08:36.648 --> 08:38.313
Implying.

08:55.766 --> 08:58.593
Where the fuck
you been?

08:58.595 --> 09:00.831
Krista fell off
her shoes last night.

09:00.835 --> 09:02.833
We had
to call an ambulance.

09:03.938 --> 09:06.303
I had some shit
I was taking care of.

09:08.676 --> 09:11.610
You're gonna
want a snort.

09:11.615 --> 09:14.011
Come on, I just
finished my bialy.

09:14.015 --> 09:16.011
Take it.

09:18.785 --> 09:21.423
Burt gervasi,
he's gone.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.223
What happened?

09:24.225 --> 09:26.550
I didn't want to overload
you with A.J. In the hospital.

09:26.558 --> 09:30.592
I don't wanna
hear that. Go.

09:30.595 --> 09:32.260
Burt let me know
the other night

09:32.268 --> 09:35.503
He's been playing both sides
of the fence with new York.

09:35.505 --> 09:38.272
- Burt?
- Measures were taken.

09:43.675 --> 09:45.940
Burt wasn't speaking
for just himself.

09:45.946 --> 09:47.543
Guys are getting
squeezed hard

09:47.545 --> 09:49.283
To sway them towards
new management.

09:49.286 --> 09:51.682
They thought you'd
be a part of it.

09:51.688 --> 09:54.013
And he got an answer.

09:59.456 --> 10:03.323
My hope is maybe now
Phil gets the message.

10:03.328 --> 10:07.232
- You know, we can talk this shit through.
- Talk?

10:15.045 --> 10:18.443
Talking about Phil.

10:18.446 --> 10:21.110
<i>We're gonna hit first.</i>

10:24.508 --> 10:27.051
And this all dovetails with other
information I got that this cocksucker

10:27.058 --> 10:28.920
Already has a target
on my back.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.752
It's a big move.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.991
So...

10:34.998 --> 10:37.492
buddha.

10:37.496 --> 10:40.091
When he stuck you
with the tab for Vito jr.,

10:40.098 --> 10:42.232
I said let it go.

10:42.237 --> 10:45.170
Obviously, truth is,
a fuck like Phil,

10:45.175 --> 10:46.771
Appeasement don't work.

10:52.516 --> 10:54.782
Oh, yeah.

11:20.545 --> 11:22.902
Three pops
within a tight time frame,

11:22.905 --> 11:26.213
24 hours, so there's no chance
for them to hit back.

11:26.216 --> 11:28.141
<i>Top three guys.</i>

11:28.147 --> 11:30.040
<i>- Paulie gaultieri?
- No, management.</i>

11:30.045 --> 11:32.481
Tony Soprano, obviously,

11:32.486 --> 11:36.253
Plus Silvio Dante
and we think Bobby baccalieri.

11:36.256 --> 11:37.820
That mortadella's
number three?

11:37.825 --> 11:39.890
He used to be
Junior Soprano's driver.

11:39.898 --> 11:43.493
And you used to sell laser printers
out the back of your crown vic.

11:51.576 --> 11:54.672
- You really slept.
- Yeah.

11:54.678 --> 11:56.172
I wasn't asleep.

11:56.176 --> 11:58.910
You want some oatmeal?
I'll make some.

11:58.915 --> 12:01.040
You want instant or the real
thing? I have half and half.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.118
I can't find my belt.

12:03.114 --> 12:06.011
It must be
up there somewhere.

12:06.019 --> 12:08.250
What?
You hid it.

12:11.629 --> 12:13.323
<i>I'll make the real thing.</i>

12:13.328 --> 12:15.463
- You'll let me know when it's ready?
- Sure.

12:24.107 --> 12:26.800
You know,
my game has got--

12:30.146 --> 12:33.043
Code six. I have a
casualty. He's urgent.

12:33.048 --> 12:34.680
<i>In response,</i>

12:34.687 --> 12:37.213
<i>The insurgents unleash
a devastating wave</i>

12:37.218 --> 12:39.151
<i>Of ieds</i>

12:39.156 --> 12:42.880
<i>And suicide bombers.</i>

12:42.887 --> 12:45.621
<i>Who got hit?
You got contact with them?</i>

12:45.625 --> 12:49.223
<i>On a
small but deadly road...</i>

12:49.225 --> 12:51.060
who's
that gunner right there?

12:57.078 --> 12:58.732
Anthony.

13:00.807 --> 13:03.043
Regarding our friend
with the gray hair--

13:03.048 --> 13:04.711
<i>I thought about it.
I want you to call Italy,</i>

13:04.718 --> 13:06.941
Get some cousins
of ours over.

13:10.086 --> 13:11.813
Who you want
to run the thing?

13:15.058 --> 13:16.781
Got it.

13:16.788 --> 13:18.753
Gotta get some tires
for Carmela's car.

13:22.897 --> 13:25.332
<i>The wine's amazing.</i>

13:25.338 --> 13:28.662
Jennifer's our resident
Italian wine expert.

13:28.666 --> 13:31.630
Is megan still in prague,
stace?

13:31.635 --> 13:35.073
Jesus, her love life. The girl
she was involved with, cecily,

13:35.078 --> 13:38.871
She's now having a torrid
pen-And-Paper relationship

13:38.876 --> 13:41.142
With an armed robber
in attica.

13:41.145 --> 13:43.011
What is this fascination
with criminals?

13:43.015 --> 13:45.252
Rescue fantasy. They
think they can fix them.

13:45.256 --> 13:47.081
I'm worried for cecily.

13:47.086 --> 13:50.521
So I googled any new stuff
on sociopathic personalities.

13:50.528 --> 13:53.420
Apparently,
the talking cure

13:53.426 --> 13:55.420
Actually helps them
become better criminals.

13:55.427 --> 13:57.363
<i>It was fascinating.</i>

13:57.366 --> 14:01.530
The study was
by yochelson and samenow.

14:01.537 --> 14:05.273
Studies turn around
every few years.

14:05.275 --> 14:07.800
This other, I think it was robert hare,

14:07.808 --> 14:09.603
Suggested
that sociopaths

14:09.607 --> 14:11.612
Actually quite glibly

14:11.616 --> 14:15.040
Engage on key issues,
like mother, family.

14:15.046 --> 14:17.043
I seem to remember that
from residency.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.053
Me too,
and I've read hare,

14:19.058 --> 14:21.623
But who's
a true sociopath?

14:21.626 --> 14:24.793
<i>I had a guy at the state asylum,</i>

14:24.797 --> 14:28.163
Slow poisoner.
They even mimic empathy.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.223
<i>They blubber and cry.</i>

14:30.238 --> 14:32.631
Did you put her up
to this?

14:32.638 --> 14:35.231
She just happened
to mention this study?

14:35.237 --> 14:38.403
- Who? Me?
- Everything okay down there?

14:38.406 --> 14:40.231
I don't know.

14:40.248 --> 14:42.970
It's a study.
Food for thought.

14:42.976 --> 14:44.573
She's blowing us off.

14:44.576 --> 14:47.811
You just can't resist
rubbing my face in it.

14:47.816 --> 14:50.413
I feel like
we should change the subject.

14:50.415 --> 14:52.981
I only suggested you
reevaluate your work

14:52.986 --> 14:56.181
With leadbelly or be
prepared to deal with moral

14:56.187 --> 14:58.251
<i>And possibly
legal consequences.</i>

14:58.255 --> 15:01.122
- Leadbelly?
- Who's that? Come on.

15:01.127 --> 15:04.291
The answer is
a female opera singer

15:04.297 --> 15:06.292
And gangster...

15:08.365 --> 15:10.462
Elliot!

15:10.478 --> 15:12.702
<i>Soprano.</i>

15:12.706 --> 15:16.343
- Tony Soprano? He's your patient?
- Wow.

15:16.348 --> 15:19.013
<i>- That's pretty cool.
- Jesus Christ, Elliot.</i>

15:19.018 --> 15:20.940
Chill out.
We're among friends.

15:20.945 --> 15:22.541
We're all professionals.

15:26.955 --> 15:29.122
So what's your verdict
on the wine, Jen?

15:29.128 --> 15:31.292
All italians have
big noses.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.960
If I had made that joke
about other groups

15:34.966 --> 15:37.292
Represented
at this table,

15:37.297 --> 15:39.361
I would be called
a bigot.

15:39.367 --> 15:42.002
<i>I meant Italian reds.</i>

15:44.505 --> 15:47.301
Still, it must be
fascinating work.

15:47.305 --> 15:50.000
It is.

16:12.495 --> 16:12.830
Still, it must be
fascinating work.

16:12.837 --> 16:15.932
Have a seat.

16:15.936 --> 16:19.272
<i>- What's up?
- Phil Leotardo.</i>

16:19.276 --> 16:23.170
Calls were made to zips.
They're coming over from naples.

16:23.175 --> 16:25.270
You contact the guy
to contact the guys.

16:25.278 --> 16:28.441
Phil's at his goomar's
every Friday night.

16:28.448 --> 16:30.910
- T know about this?
- What?

16:30.916 --> 16:33.683
- What kind of question is that?
- Watch your fat fucking mouth.

16:33.688 --> 16:37.123
Hey, whoa whoa whoa whoa.
What are you concerned about?

16:37.127 --> 16:39.691
I lived through the '70s
by the skin of my nuts

16:39.698 --> 16:41.691
When the columbos
were going at it.

16:41.698 --> 16:44.361
There ain't a bigger
cocksucker than Phil Leotardo.

16:44.365 --> 16:46.760
I just wanna make sure
somebody knows

16:46.767 --> 16:49.662
There could be a line
of cozarellis a mile long.

16:49.667 --> 16:53.003
Duly noted. So there's
no problem then.

17:42.026 --> 17:42.582
There could be a line
of cozarellis a mile long.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.590
Don't worry about them.

17:48.596 --> 17:50.763
Paulie, those guys
are outside.

17:50.768 --> 17:53.092
Fuck you talking
so loud for?

17:53.097 --> 17:56.433
<i>Don't discuss this until
we're in the piscia dun.</i>

17:59.436 --> 18:01.443
It's all yours.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.782
I just picked 'em up
at the airport.

19:02.165 --> 19:04.501
<i>Anthony.</i>

19:17.615 --> 19:21.183
So what do you clear
a year around here?

19:21.186 --> 19:23.751
I don't mean to pry, you
know, just round numbers.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.693
I'm asking
because Meadow--

19:32.698 --> 19:35.302
Well, I told you she's
taking pre-Med classes--

19:35.408 --> 19:38.701
Well, she's not
gonna be a doctor.

19:39.906 --> 19:42.143
She told us.

19:43.945 --> 19:45.940
It's kind of sad,
isn't it?

19:45.945 --> 19:47.541
Depends.

19:47.548 --> 19:50.581
It's just a nice thing
to be,

19:50.587 --> 19:52.311
Helping sick babies.

19:52.315 --> 19:54.553
Her change of heart
bothers you?

19:54.555 --> 19:57.650
Her mother too,
much more than me.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.322
<i>I mean,
all that worrying--</i>

19:59.325 --> 20:02.363
Which private school,
columbia university,

20:02.366 --> 20:05.392
This and that,
and in the end

20:05.397 --> 20:08.131
She'll get married,
squeeze out some kids

20:08.136 --> 20:10.262
After what, a couple yea
in the work force?

20:10.275 --> 20:13.503
- I'm still working.
- Yeah, but you're divorced.

20:15.246 --> 20:18.741
Criminal law,
that's what she's taking up.

20:18.748 --> 20:21.741
And I told Carmela, it's
not the end of the world.

20:23.885 --> 20:25.513
She's interested

20:25.515 --> 20:28.280
In civil rights--

20:28.287 --> 20:31.320
Muslims and blacks

20:31.325 --> 20:34.191
And that and a dime.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.833
Hopefully, she'll wind up
at a big firm--

20:39.465 --> 20:42.801
White-Collar crime.

20:44.637 --> 20:46.403
<i>Just, you know,</i>

20:46.408 --> 20:49.000
Dr. Soprano.

20:51.616 --> 20:53.043
Sounds nice.

20:57.415 --> 20:59.613
Your parents must
have been very proud.

20:59.618 --> 21:01.621
I think so.

21:01.625 --> 21:03.621
Look at all the people
like me you've helped.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.223
With all the human
suffering in this world,

21:07.228 --> 21:08.821
You've done
something important...

21:10.935 --> 21:14.632
like those people

21:14.637 --> 21:16.702
Who are trying
to help my son.

21:19.405 --> 21:21.800
God bless 'em.

21:23.406 --> 21:25.241
$2,000 a day
in that place,

21:25.248 --> 21:27.641
But if it helps--

21:27.647 --> 21:29.813
And as you know, my
plumbers' union insurance

21:29.818 --> 21:32.813
Only covers 10%
of mental.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.493
He's really hurting--

21:38.498 --> 21:40.651
A.J.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.662
And you?

21:42.665 --> 21:44.933
Although, maybe,
you know--

21:44.935 --> 21:47.462
You know what? Forget his
hurts. Maybe I should have just--

21:47.466 --> 21:48.932
Put your shoe
up his ass?

21:48.938 --> 21:52.170
Yeah yeah, frankly.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.870
Well, we talked
about this.

21:55.878 --> 21:57.943
Untalked about it.

21:57.945 --> 21:59.842
Huh?

22:01.185 --> 22:03.483
- Anyway, Carmela--
- Mollycoddled him.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.112
- My old man--
- Are you a shining example

22:06.115 --> 22:09.182
For the huge collection
of wingtips and loafers

22:09.187 --> 22:12.252
That must be lodged up
your lower bowel?

22:12.255 --> 22:15.023
What's the matter
with you?

22:15.025 --> 22:17.523
Is it because I said
that about being divorced?

22:17.535 --> 22:19.931
You were saying.

22:19.937 --> 22:22.300
He's my only son.

22:22.306 --> 22:25.973
He's young. Most of the
time they pull out of this.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.771
But I've been depressed for
years. What if he don't pull out?

22:28.778 --> 22:30.941
So the boy who
never cared

22:30.946 --> 22:32.971
About anything

22:32.977 --> 22:35.713
Now cares
about too much.

22:35.717 --> 22:37.712
Yeah, I guess.

22:37.716 --> 22:40.712
And the daughter,
like all females,

22:40.726 --> 22:44.222
Ultimately somehow
disappoints.

22:44.227 --> 22:46.323
- I didn't say that.
- Oh.

22:46.326 --> 22:49.122
What's with the tone?

22:49.127 --> 22:51.120
You sound like
you're glad

22:51.138 --> 22:53.063
I'm taking it
on the chin.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.830
Maybe you're projecting
hostile feelings.

22:55.838 --> 22:59.300
Bullshit.
If we had instant replay,

22:59.305 --> 23:01.002
You'd see it
in two seconds.

23:01.008 --> 23:03.143
Well, we don't have
instant replay.

23:03.146 --> 23:06.440
I know that. Jesus Christ,
you sound like my fucking wife.

23:06.446 --> 23:09.240
- Your "fucking wife."
- You know what I mean.

23:09.248 --> 23:11.911
The "departures"
magazine out there,

23:11.915 --> 23:13.912
Did you give any thought
at all

23:13.925 --> 23:17.252
To someone else
who might wanna read it

23:17.255 --> 23:21.261
- Before you tore out the entire page?
- What?

23:21.265 --> 23:24.363
It's not the first time you've
defaced my reading materials.

23:24.368 --> 23:26.660
You saw that, huh?

23:26.665 --> 23:29.602
People tear shit out of
your magazines all the time.

23:29.606 --> 23:32.170
They're a mess.
I try to read 'em.

23:32.175 --> 23:34.370
I don't think
I can help you.

23:34.377 --> 23:36.271
Well, change 'em.
Bring in some new shit.

23:36.275 --> 23:38.041
I mean, therapeutically.

23:40.687 --> 23:44.341
What are you
talking about?

23:44.356 --> 23:47.253
I've only missed three appointments
since we had that heart-To-Heart.

23:47.258 --> 23:49.983
The new big thing
these days is called

23:49.986 --> 23:52.320
"Psychodynamic therapy"

23:52.327 --> 23:54.620
Combined with anafranil.

23:54.626 --> 23:57.320
- Who?
- A medication. There's a doctor in bloomfield

23:57.338 --> 23:58.961
You could see.

23:58.968 --> 24:01.533
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
okay.

24:01.537 --> 24:03.400
Now what the fuck
is this?

24:03.406 --> 24:05.231
You're firing me

24:05.237 --> 24:08.042
'Cause I defaced
your "departures" magazine?

24:08.046 --> 24:11.473
I'm giving you my considered
medical opinion.

24:11.476 --> 24:13.973
Okay, I should
have asked you

24:13.985 --> 24:16.243
For the steak recipe.

24:17.758 --> 24:21.052
And missing sessions, unfortunately,
is part of my condition.

24:21.058 --> 24:24.051
What do you know
about your condition?

24:24.058 --> 24:27.493
You miss appointments because
you don't give a shit

24:27.495 --> 24:30.020
About commitments,
about what I do,

24:30.026 --> 24:33.633
About the body of work
that's gone into

24:33.636 --> 24:35.933
Building up
this science.

24:39.738 --> 24:43.303
Go ahead, tell me again
I sound like your wife.

24:43.307 --> 24:44.671
Well,
if the shoe fits...

24:46.678 --> 24:49.780
we're making progress.
It's been seven years.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.553
Do you want some names?

24:52.555 --> 24:55.023
Okay, listen, I'm
gonna tell you something

24:55.026 --> 24:56.722
And you're not
gonna like it,

24:56.725 --> 24:59.291
- But we can say anything in here, right?
- Go ahead!

25:01.228 --> 25:03.192
I'm chalking this
all up

25:03.195 --> 25:06.690
To female menopausal
situations.

25:06.698 --> 25:08.861
You're not
my gynecologist.

25:08.865 --> 25:11.972
Well, you don't need a gynecologist
to know which way the wind blows.

25:19.646 --> 25:22.443
So wait a minute,

25:22.448 --> 25:24.141
You're telling me

25:24.155 --> 25:25.980
After all this time,

25:25.986 --> 25:29.452
<i>After everything
we shared in here,</i>

25:29.456 --> 25:32.552
You're cutting me loose just as
my son got out of the hospital

25:32.555 --> 25:34.492
For trying
to kill himself?

25:36.966 --> 25:39.231
Since you are in crisis,

25:39.237 --> 25:41.161
I don't want to waste
your time.

25:42.836 --> 25:45.802
I'm gonna be
fucking honest.

25:45.807 --> 25:47.402
As a doctor,

25:47.408 --> 25:49.970
I think what you're
doing is immoral.

26:44.966 --> 26:45.560
As a doctor,

27:04.315 --> 27:08.151
<i>Yes.</i>

27:08.155 --> 27:10.081
D.H.L.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.722
- Who?
- Package-A,

27:12.728 --> 27:16.162
D.H.L. Express
for Mr. Philip.

27:17.835 --> 27:19.562
For sign.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.270
For sign.

28:06.717 --> 28:09.581
Yeah.

28:50.927 --> 28:51.852
Yeah.

28:57.497 --> 28:59.792
- Yeah.
- It's done.

28:59.798 --> 29:01.762
I think the love interest
got in the way, though.

29:01.765 --> 29:05.203
<i>Couldn't be helped
apparently.</i>

29:05.206 --> 29:08.042
<i>You ever see Phil
with the goomar?</i>

29:08.045 --> 29:10.202
Once maybe.
Why?

29:10.218 --> 29:11.842
Could he talk to her
in ukrainian?

29:11.846 --> 29:14.310
Ukrainian?
The fuck do I know?

29:16.316 --> 29:18.150
I gotta go.

29:24.555 --> 29:27.450
Paulie, it's done.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.743
Listen, I--

29:41.745 --> 29:44.303
I quit therapy.

29:44.318 --> 29:47.571
And this time
I'm never going back.

29:49.685 --> 29:52.851
Except for that slight
improvement around the shooting,

29:52.856 --> 29:54.852
She wasn't doing you
much good anyway.

29:54.855 --> 29:58.323
Here we go.

29:58.407 --> 30:00.953
- Hi, strangers, how are you?
- How are you?

30:00.966 --> 30:03.922
- Good, not bad.
- Good good.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.430
There they are.

30:05.436 --> 30:08.033
So mead' was in here

30:08.036 --> 30:09.532
With patrick Parisi.

30:09.536 --> 30:11.872
- Yeah.
- We are very happy.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.703
Very happy.

30:13.706 --> 30:15.941
Is it true what she said?
She's quitting pre-Med?

30:15.946 --> 30:19.770
Yes, thank God.
We are so relieved.

30:19.778 --> 30:22.111
You know, with aids
and...

30:22.116 --> 30:23.683
it's not just that.

30:23.685 --> 30:26.412
I don't know one doctor
who is advising his children

30:26.417 --> 30:29.751
To go into medicine. Between
the insurance companies

30:29.757 --> 30:31.223
Over their shoulder,

30:31.225 --> 30:33.052
The hospitals
are making cutbacks...

30:33.056 --> 30:35.420
she'd have been good
at it, though, mead'.

30:35.426 --> 30:38.363
Always intellectually
curious, even as a tyke.

30:38.368 --> 30:40.563
But does compassion
come naturally to her?

30:40.567 --> 30:43.362
Patience?
I'm not so sure.

30:43.365 --> 30:45.072
What are you
talking about?

30:45.078 --> 30:46.600
So what is she
gonna do now?

30:46.605 --> 30:49.072
- Well...
- Law.

30:49.075 --> 30:51.540
<i>- Oh!
- Constitutional law.</i>

30:51.545 --> 30:53.872
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

30:53.887 --> 30:56.381
What about A.J.?
How's he doing?

30:56.388 --> 30:58.951
- He's good. He's good.
- Good.

31:02.255 --> 31:04.721
Ton', you know
who's in tonight?

31:04.726 --> 31:06.322
"Mangenius."

31:07.565 --> 31:10.792
<i>He's the jets
coach, sweetie.</i>

31:10.797 --> 31:14.031
- I should go say hello.
- Okay.

31:17.577 --> 31:19.700
So mead'
and patrick Parisi?

31:22.076 --> 31:23.902
Little awkward
though, maybe.

31:25.447 --> 31:27.980
Patsy still works for Tony.
He's an underling.

31:27.988 --> 31:31.812
Cupid's dart lands,
you know?

31:31.817 --> 31:34.680
I'm gonna send some
limoncellos over in celebration.

31:34.687 --> 31:36.783
Great.

31:46.436 --> 31:48.460
You don't answer
your fucking phone?

31:48.468 --> 31:51.372
- I tried you 50 times last night.
- Nah, we shut 'em off.

31:51.378 --> 31:53.701
Gab came down with a terrible
case of food poisoning.

31:56.277 --> 31:59.713
You can pass the word upstairs.
The gray goose is gone.

31:59.717 --> 32:02.782
- Good.
- Apparently, the goomar had to be taken out too.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.112
But I say,
who gives a fuck?

32:05.116 --> 32:08.623
Remember that drunken fucking scene
she caused at the "Jersey boys" party?

32:08.625 --> 32:10.780
I actually felt bad
for Phil.

32:13.697 --> 32:15.621
What's the matter?

32:15.627 --> 32:17.522
Whenever I think
of that fucking play,

32:17.538 --> 32:19.791
I picture ma dying alone

32:19.795 --> 32:22.901
Like a dog on that bus.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.700
You're gonna make someone
happy with this news today.

32:25.707 --> 32:29.143
Think I'll ask
for some time off.

32:29.147 --> 32:32.642
Hey, who does this
look like? Look.

32:53.368 --> 32:54.432
Think I'll ask
for some time off.

32:54.436 --> 32:57.903
Don't cry. Good little
girls don't cry. Babies cry.

32:59.537 --> 33:02.271
<i>Hey.</i>

33:02.276 --> 33:05.072
- How's it going?
- Good.

33:05.078 --> 33:07.513
Have my card game.

33:07.515 --> 33:09.713
Carm volunteered
to take nica.

33:11.286 --> 33:13.753
Emptying the pool, huh?

33:13.757 --> 33:16.622
- Cost a fortune to heat.
- Yeah.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.391
What can I do you for?

33:20.395 --> 33:22.561
Had a call
from mario diaco.

33:22.567 --> 33:25.232
- Who's that?
- Uncle jun's accountant,

33:25.236 --> 33:28.802
The one with the artifician
trying to reach you

33:28.806 --> 33:31.673
<i>For two weeks.</i>

33:31.678 --> 33:35.570
Uncle jun's finally
out of money.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.673
They think that maybe there's
some squirreled around,

33:38.677 --> 33:40.273
But he can't remember.

33:42.016 --> 33:44.412
It's a fucking sin,
isn't it?

33:45.955 --> 33:47.952
Plus, with the larynx,
he thinks mario's

33:47.957 --> 33:50.153
From outer space,
so...

33:50.158 --> 33:52.121
<i>the upshot is
he can't pay</i>

33:52.125 --> 33:54.191
For living at wycoff
psychiatric anymore,

33:54.196 --> 33:56.722
And they're gonna move him
to a state facility.

33:58.597 --> 34:00.130
I know, Tony,

34:00.137 --> 34:03.331
But Jesus, those fucking
places are snake pits.

34:03.338 --> 34:05.371
Then he'll make
some new friends.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.301
I understand.

34:09.304 --> 34:11.143
You gonna bail him out?

34:11.148 --> 34:13.913
We don't have that kind
of money. We'd contribute.

34:16.386 --> 34:19.553
Bobby feels...

34:19.556 --> 34:20.783
you know.

34:22.886 --> 34:25.420
Right.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.791
You got a lot of balls
coming to me.

34:33.967 --> 34:36.603
And as for your husband,
Janice,

34:36.605 --> 34:39.572
<i>- "Exile on main street."
- Don't say that.</i>

34:39.577 --> 34:41.373
You trust a guy,
you bring him along

34:41.377 --> 34:43.699
And for what?

34:43.717 --> 34:46.511
<i>He feels sorry
for Junior?</i>

34:53.315 --> 34:55.320
Bullshit.

35:07.808 --> 35:10.263
Ton', it's bad news.

35:16.108 --> 35:19.111
Paulie said he wants
it known it's on him,

35:19.118 --> 35:21.340
He takes full
responsibility,

35:21.346 --> 35:23.612
But that he
didn't do nothing.

35:24.955 --> 35:27.281
Shit.

35:27.287 --> 35:30.781
Yeah, nobody,

35:30.795 --> 35:34.120
I mean nobody, knows
where the fuck Phil is,

35:34.125 --> 35:36.522
Four, five days now.

35:36.527 --> 35:39.133
So we never really had
a shot at him.

35:41.136 --> 35:43.702
How about the house
in Florida?

35:43.705 --> 35:44.973
I had beans send
somebody past.

35:44.978 --> 35:46.971
The house is all
shuttered up.

35:46.977 --> 35:49.642
He put everything in place,
his moves on us.

35:49.645 --> 35:52.170
He goes into hiding,
waits it out.

35:52.176 --> 35:54.482
Going to ground,
they call it.

35:54.488 --> 35:56.241
Who?

35:56.247 --> 35:59.012
It's an expression.

36:01.428 --> 36:03.422
Who knows what the fuck
he's got planned exactly.

36:03.428 --> 36:06.652
You get word to everybody:
eyes in the back of your head,

36:06.657 --> 36:10.162
Break routines, collections,
all that shit.

36:11.498 --> 36:14.831
You tell everybody.

36:14.835 --> 36:16.332
Got it.

36:16.336 --> 36:19.230
In the meantime, we keep
trying. Get a 20 on Phil.

36:45.636 --> 36:48.730
- Beautiful.
- You never see a blue comet

36:48.735 --> 36:51.970
In that condition.
I mean, look at the coaches.

36:51.975 --> 36:54.702
Every window
still lights up.

36:54.707 --> 36:56.941
If that train still ran
new York to A.C.,

36:56.945 --> 37:00.113
Atlantic city would be a
much different place today.

37:00.115 --> 37:03.213
- Better class of people.
- I suppose.

37:03.215 --> 37:05.911
Who the fuck
really knows?

37:05.917 --> 37:09.821
Still, it's nice
to think that.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.120
Imagine riding
in that club car,

37:12.126 --> 37:13.752
<i>Sipping on a negroni.</i>

37:13.767 --> 37:17.320
Eight grand
for the whole set, huh?

37:18.397 --> 37:20.560
There's other people
interested.

37:27.448 --> 37:29.643
I'm gonna go for it.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.641
Your son will
like this too.

37:31.645 --> 37:33.643
Looks fast.

37:35.116 --> 37:38.053
He don't care.

38:22.966 --> 38:25.793
- Hurry up, for Christ's sake.
- All right, aspett'.

38:25.797 --> 38:28.730
If I'm gonna be working away from
the office, I should have this stuff.

38:28.737 --> 38:29.963
You wanna make
yourself useful?

38:29.965 --> 38:32.673
Get the girls' pay slips
over there.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.671
Put 'em in a bag.
Or give 'em to me.

38:37.016 --> 38:39.013
Come on.

38:42.648 --> 38:44.553
All right.

38:59.668 --> 39:00.991
Let's go.

39:03.336 --> 39:06.203
- Yeah, that's them there.
- Fuck!

39:06.205 --> 39:08.241
What the fuck?

39:17.016 --> 39:18.880
Fuck!

39:31.896 --> 39:34.290
- Let's get the hell
out of here.

40:13.675 --> 40:15.640
Wait here.

40:20.646 --> 40:24.413
Melissa found a memory stick in
my prada bag that wasn't printed.

40:24.418 --> 40:27.052
God, remember what a dick
this guy was at first?

40:27.058 --> 40:29.483
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:30.826 --> 40:32.822
I need to talk to you.

40:42.268 --> 40:45.032
- Nobody called you?
- No. What's the matter?

40:46.638 --> 40:50.170
Bobby's dead. He's shot.
Sil's in the hospital.

40:50.175 --> 40:52.373
- What happened?
- Could be several things.

40:58.358 --> 41:00.352
- "Leave here"? What are you talking about?
- Just temporarily,

41:00.357 --> 41:03.020
- Till we get the situation under control.
- What does that mean?

41:03.026 --> 41:04.791
Carm, help me out here.
Don't argue.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.951
- You mean they're after you.
- We should split up.

41:06.966 --> 41:09.691
You and the kids go.
I'll be somewhere else.

41:09.695 --> 41:11.531
<i>- Oh my God!
- Now look,</i>

41:11.536 --> 41:13.362
Families don't get touched.
You know that, hmm?

41:13.368 --> 41:15.232
<i>I just wanna know</i>

41:15.235 --> 41:17.263
Every night that you're not
sitting here out in the open.

41:17.276 --> 41:19.831
- Where should I go? Where are you gonna go?
- The house you just bought,

41:19.835 --> 41:22.800
- The estate sale--
Go there. - Oh, Jesus.

41:22.808 --> 41:24.640
A hotel then.
It doesn't fucking matter.

41:27.645 --> 41:30.583
- Okay.
- You all right?

41:30.588 --> 41:32.152
All right,
we gotta get moving.

41:32.155 --> 41:33.912
And like I said,
it's just a precaution.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.150
- What about your sister?
- She's gotta know by now.

41:36.157 --> 41:39.321
We'll stop over there after
we're cleared out of here.

41:39.328 --> 41:41.760
- And gab? How bad is sil?
- We'll make some calls.

41:41.767 --> 41:44.091
- Maybe I should go on ahead
of you over to jan's. - Carm--

41:44.095 --> 41:45.932
Meadow is basically living
at patrick's, thank God.

41:45.935 --> 41:47.692
A.J.-- How are you gonna
get him to go along?

41:47.708 --> 41:50.360
- He won't leave the house.
- He's gonna leave the house.

41:50.378 --> 41:52.031
- Tony--
- On a piece of plywood

41:52.035 --> 41:54.030
If necessary, but he's
gonna leave the house.

41:54.048 --> 41:56.173
Anything I can do?

41:56.175 --> 41:57.473
- No.
- You heard?

41:57.478 --> 42:00.912
- Or maybe I should just leave.
- I'll call you.

42:02.348 --> 42:04.343
It says shukrijumah
brought nuclear material

42:04.358 --> 42:07.181
Into the country
from mexico in 2002.

42:07.186 --> 42:09.080
Fuck.

42:10.596 --> 42:12.590
Leave us alone, hon.

42:13.926 --> 42:16.960
- Hang downstairs.
- Better yet, don't.

42:22.505 --> 42:25.532
You just bust in? We could
have been doing anything.

42:25.538 --> 42:28.143
Yeah, but what
were you doing? Nothing.

42:28.147 --> 42:30.702
We're just friends.

42:31.875 --> 42:35.081
All right, listen.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.642
Come, sit .

42:36.647 --> 42:38.981
Come on.

42:42.828 --> 42:45.491
Your uncle Bobby's dead.

42:45.495 --> 42:49.292
- What?
- He's dead. He got shot.

42:49.295 --> 42:51.392
- What do you mean, "he got shot"?
- Listen to me,

42:51.398 --> 42:55.061
And I don't have any time to go into
a debate about any of this, okay?

42:55.068 --> 42:58.503
And it's important
that we all leave

42:58.506 --> 43:01.702
For a little while
until things settle down.

43:01.707 --> 43:05.243
What? Holy fuck.

43:05.245 --> 43:07.673
It's just a precaution.

43:07.687 --> 43:10.910
The point is that...

43:10.915 --> 43:13.811
I'm gonna be dependent on
you to help out your mother.

43:13.828 --> 43:15.953
- Help out how?
- Just do what she asks,

43:15.958 --> 43:19.120
You know, chores,
tasks,

43:19.126 --> 43:21.521
Whatever.

43:21.527 --> 43:23.523
And don't add
to the problem.

43:23.535 --> 43:25.863
What do you mean?
What the fuck did I do?

43:25.866 --> 43:29.262
Don't break her balls,
all right, huh?

43:29.267 --> 43:32.971
Just help her

43:32.975 --> 43:34.871
With aunt Janice,
whatever.

43:36.446 --> 43:39.041
Uncle Bobby's dead.

43:39.047 --> 43:41.140
Yeah.

43:42.315 --> 43:45.982
This is really
depressing to me.

43:48.386 --> 43:50.383
He was a good guy.

43:50.395 --> 43:54.021
I was already having
so much trouble maintaining.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.231
Ow! Ow!

44:05.736 --> 44:07.400
<i>My tailbone!</i>

44:07.408 --> 44:09.641
Here, pack a bag.

44:09.648 --> 44:12.141
Now!

44:12.147 --> 44:14.741
And you won't need no sandals
or fucking resort wear.

44:16.418 --> 44:18.653
I'll be waiting
downstairs.

44:58.797 --> 45:01.591
Oh my God.

45:01.598 --> 45:03.591
Oh my God.

45:10.536 --> 45:14.303
I called the hospital. They
wouldn't give no info on sil.

45:14.305 --> 45:16.601
Gab's brother
finally phoned back.

45:16.605 --> 45:18.770
Doctors don't think
he'll recover consciousness.

45:35.967 --> 45:37.023
Gab's brother
finally phoned back.

45:37.035 --> 45:39.560
<i>Look at the stems on blondie.</i>

45:39.567 --> 45:42.801
Heh!
He's riding high.

45:42.806 --> 45:44.832
Nice to be young, huh?

46:49.706 --> 46:51.701
I'm gonna bunk down here.

46:51.705 --> 46:53.631
All right, you go take care
of your wife,

46:53.647 --> 46:56.302
That flu.

46:58.715 --> 47:01.073
- You too.
- Where the fuck I gotta be?

47:01.086 --> 47:02.541
Yeah, I'm gonna stay.

47:09.886 --> 47:12.090
We order a pizz'.

47:12.097 --> 47:14.423
Yeah.

47:20.267 --> 47:22.301
<i>Get some meatballs and sausage too.</i>

47:22.306 --> 47:25.003
<i>Couple of salads.
No vegetarian pizza.</i>

48:03.545 --> 48:06.271
<i>You probably don't even
hear it when it happens, right?</i>

48:06.277 --> 48:09.643
- Ask your friend in there,
on the wall.

48:25.938 --> 48:25.932
<i>You probably don't even
hear it when it happens, right?</i>
