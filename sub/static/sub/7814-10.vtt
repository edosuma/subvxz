Yes.

...the wilderness.

Today Kick Buttowski becomes--

01:46.333 --> 01:48.125
Oh, man.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.083
Oh, roughing it sure is fun,
huh, kids?

01:57.125 --> 01:59.709
No offense, Mom,
but this isn’t roughing it.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.041
I should be camping for real,

02:01.125 --> 02:04.500
like Jock Wilder,
extreme nature guy.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.208
Hey, Kick, what’s up?

02:07.291 --> 02:09.834
I’ve never been tested
in the comfort
of the cul-de-sac.

02:09.917 --> 02:12.625
I need to get out there
and tame the wilderness

by myself

02:20.875 --> 02:21.959
in the woods.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.792
I don’t know, Kick.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.792
Camping
on a camping trip?

02:25.875 --> 02:27.667
Oh, let the boy have fun.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.500
I remember sleeping out
under the stars
when I was his age.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.041
Whoa, Dad,

02:31.125 --> 02:34.041

Oh, yeah.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.875
Now, you’ll need
a hat, gloves, jacket,

and peanuts, a nut log,

your dental floss.

Get back to the RV before
you embarrass yourself, Brad.

03:36.709 --> 03:38.291
You don’t belong
out in the wilderness.

03:38.375 --> 03:39.917
You call this the wilderness?

We’re right here, son.

Mom told me to keep an eye
on you

little life with pain
and suffering.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.458
I can’t remember which.

Yeah, I wonder whose
Mr. Nutty bar this is.

Don’t open that.
Animals can smell food
a mile away.

Oh, no, you were right, Kick.

The big, scary squirrel
is going to eat us.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.000
Look at me.
I’m Kick, and I’m afraid
of little baby squirrels.

in the stupid wilderness

05:41.125 --> 05:42.959
with no sign of civilization.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.834
Finally.

05:46.917 --> 05:48.291
Hey, why aren’t we going
back?

05:48.375 --> 05:50.542
I’ve already been that way.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.041
I’m going this way,

05:52.125 --> 05:53.542

Well, I’m going back
the way we came.

Uh, but you need protecting.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.375
[howls]

06:05.458 --> 06:07.333
Is that really necessary?

06:07.417 --> 06:09.208
It’s the call of the wild.

06:09.291 --> 06:10.542
You wouldn’t understand.

06:10.625 --> 06:11.917
What I don’t understand

06:12.000 --> 06:14.500
is how are we going to get
over this gorge?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.208
Leave that to me.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.041
Kick, don’t leave me!

06:25.709 --> 06:27.125
Grab on.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.917
Gotcha!

06:47.000 --> 06:49.208

some squirrel stew.

something to eat?

We’re-- We’re going to eat
a moose?

07:06.959 --> 07:09.917
No, he stole my berries.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.417
We should be asleep
in our nice, comfortable beds,

07:15.500 --> 07:17.375
but you wanted to spend
the night in the stupid woods

07:17.458 --> 07:19.417
because of that stupid TV show.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.083
What are you doing?
Building shelter.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.417
You call this shelter?

07:23.500 --> 07:26.291
More like, I don’t know,

I can’t even make fun of you.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.750
Listen up, Brad.

07:31.834 --> 07:34.083
I came out here to tame
the wilderness,

07:34.166 --> 07:35.750
and that’s what
I’m going to do.

07:35.834 --> 07:39.041
Termites, you know,
the edible kind.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.500
Don’t worry.
[gulps]

07:42.583 --> 07:44.166
You’ll get used to it.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.125
I don’t need your shelter

07:46.208 --> 07:48.000
or your termites.

[thunder cracks]

08:04.166 --> 08:08.417
Brad, do you--
do you want to share
the shelter?

08:08.500 --> 08:09.625
No way.

08:09.709 --> 08:13.834
I got me a nice, soft pillow
right here.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.000
Ow.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.250
Brad, you need shelter.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.417
I can’t afford to carry you
all the way back.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.834
Mm, comfy.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.583
And I got
this lush, natural blanket.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.959
Mm, so soft on my skin.

08:27.041 --> 08:30.000
Bet you wish you had my warm,
cozy blanket.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.291
Yeah, Brad.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.917
That’s right, Brad.
I wish I could have a blanket
made of poison ivy.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.875
Poison ivy?

08:55.041 --> 08:56.083
How did I get in here?

08:56.166 --> 08:58.875
I brought you in.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.834
You-- You did that
for me?

09:01.917 --> 09:03.542
Don’t touch me.

09:03.625 --> 09:05.917
Come on, Brad.
I’ve conquered nature.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.291
Now it’s time to go home.

09:07.375 --> 09:10.458
But there’s poison ivy
on my poison oak.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.750
Savor the victory, Brad.

09:13.834 --> 09:15.917
We survived a night
in the wilderness,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.709
and now all we have to do
is make it back alive.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.917

quickie-sandy gunk?

Quicksand.

09:25.375 --> 09:28.583
Help! Someone! Anyone!

09:28.667 --> 09:31.792
Quit flailing.
You’re making it worse.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.417
Listen, I-- I’m sorry.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.125
I mean, I really screwed
things up for us.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.834
I’m sorry I called you
a dill weed all those times.

09:39.917 --> 09:42.750
I don’t-- I don’t even know
what a dill weed is.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.917
It’s a perennial herb.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.333
You’re a--
You’re a good brother.

09:49.417 --> 09:50.875
Never thought I’d go this way.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.000
but quicksand?
What about me?

09:55.083 --> 09:58.166
Covered in boils,
itchy poison ivy,

09:58.250 --> 10:01.125
and there’s a termite stuck
in my teeth.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.917
[whimpers]

10:26.959 --> 10:28.417
There we go, all packed up.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.875
Oh, where are Kick and Brad?

10:30.959 --> 10:32.500
We have to check out soon.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.333
[gasps]
They’re gone.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.625
I knew I should have given them
the moist towelettes.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.583
Mom, I’m back.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.417
Oh, Kick,
there you are, baby.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.583
I’m no baby.

10:41.667 --> 10:42.959
I’m a man.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.291
Oh.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.041
Who’s my little man?

10:46.125 --> 10:47.375
I am.

10:47.458 --> 10:51.083
Mommy! It’s me, Brad.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.417
Great, kids.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.583
Next time maybe you can stay
30 feet away.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.583
Kick, that stuff I said
in the quicksand?

11:00.667 --> 11:02.250
[Kick] Yeah?

11:02.333 --> 11:04.208
[smacks Kick]
It never happened.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.041
You’re still just
my perennial herb brother.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.792
[Kick]
Oh, come on, Mom.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.750
Why do you got to keep
a boy down?

11:18.834 --> 11:20.333
[barking]

11:20.417 --> 11:23.750
Oh, Kick, you only have
to watch Oskar for a few hours

11:23.834 --> 11:26.750
while Mrs. Chicarelli
and I play in our shuffleboard
tournament.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.375
What about Mr. Vickle?
He’s getting his hair dyed.

11:29.458 --> 11:30.917
Ooh, lovely.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.917
Brad?
[Honey]
Studying.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.166
[belches]

11:34.250 --> 11:35.917
Kendall?
It’s her birthday party.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.500
I don’t think
this is a good idea.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.750
Oh, nonsense.
It’ll be fun.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.166
We’ll be back at 7:30.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.291
Have a good time.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.291
How I let your mother
convince me

11:51.375 --> 11:54.750
to let you take care
of my dear, sweet Oskar

11:54.834 --> 11:55.834
is beyond me.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.000
Here.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.667
[reads]

11:59.750 --> 12:01.834
You will bathe him,
you will feed him,

12:01.917 --> 12:02.959
and you will walk him,

12:03.041 --> 12:04.125
and let me be clear.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.291
Anything happens
to my precious puppy,

12:06.375 --> 12:09.875
and I’ll see to it
you are grounded
for life.

12:09.959 --> 12:12.417
I don’t respond well
to threats.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.750
Not a threat.
A fact.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.208
Okay, snookums,

12:16.291 --> 12:17.792
give Mommy a kiss.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.291
Oh, yeah, yeah.
[babbles]

12:20.375 --> 12:21.375
Remember...

12:27.250 --> 12:28.959
Where did he go?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.667
Biscuits.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.625
Thanks for helping me out,
Gunther.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.208
My pleasure.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.083
I’ve always wanted to see
the inside of snitchy’s house.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.333
Ooh, fruit.

12:38.417 --> 12:39.709
[squeaking]

12:40.959 --> 12:43.333
Mm, waxy.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.625
[Oskar chomps, growling]

12:44.709 --> 12:47.667
Okay, Oskar,
and you don’t like me,

12:47.750 --> 12:49.041
so it’s up to you.

12:49.125 --> 12:51.125
Are we going to do this
the easy way

12:51.208 --> 12:54.417
or the hard way?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.458
That’s a good--

12:55.542 --> 12:57.709
Hard way it is, then.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.792
[pans clanging]

13:01.875 --> 13:03.750
[Kick] You stubborn little--

13:03.834 --> 13:06.583
Come on, eat your dinner.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.250
Hang on.
I have an idea.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.208
Look here, Oskar.
It smells really good.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.709
I bet it tastes even better.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.291
Mm, yum, yum, yum.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.417
Wow, this does smell good.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.792
Gunther!
Oh, sorry.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.458
[growling]
Get in the tub.

13:27.542 --> 13:28.709
[Gunther]
Come on, Oskar.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.667
I put in chamomile
and bath salts.

13:30.750 --> 13:34.500
It’s dreamy.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.959
Oopsy.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.542
Okay, Oskar,
time for your--

13:40.625 --> 13:42.333
[squishes]
...ew, walk.

13:42.417 --> 13:43.417
Not on the carpet.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.500
Bad boy.
Bad boy.

13:48.709 --> 13:51.375
"Oskar likes to take
a mellow stroll."

13:51.458 --> 13:55.125
You don’t want to just take
a stroll, do you?

13:55.208 --> 13:58.166
You want to go for a run.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.000
What are you doing?
Miss Chicarelli said mellow.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.625
That’s one thing Oskar and I
have in common.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.333
We don’t do mellow.

14:05.417 --> 14:07.041
[Gunther screaming]

14:07.125 --> 14:09.166
I thought he liked it mellow.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.583
Snitchy just never let Oskar
hit the gas.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.542
Right, Oskar?

14:15.875 --> 14:17.667
[Gunther yells]

14:20.291 --> 14:22.125
[grunts]

14:22.208 --> 14:23.792
[yells]

14:51.750 --> 14:54.667
Now, that’s what I call
walking the dog.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.875
You’re okay, kid.

14:56.959 --> 14:59.083
Did he just smile?

14:59.166 --> 15:01.166
See what happens when we loosen
the leash a little?

15:01.250 --> 15:03.000
Too many restrictions
keep a dog down.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.125
[barks]

15:04.208 --> 15:05.625
Come to think of it, Oskar,

15:05.709 --> 15:07.417
you kind of remind me
of someone.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
Eat your dinner.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.000
Get in the tub.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.625
Not on the carpet.
Bad boy.

15:15.709 --> 15:16.917
Bad boy.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.041
I never realized it before,

15:19.125 --> 15:21.458
but you and me,
we’re a special breed.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.667
[growling]

15:23.750 --> 15:25.792
Poor guy,
he must have flees.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.500
No, he’s just itching
to get off his leash.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.166
Are you crazy?

15:30.250 --> 15:33.417
He’ll bolt,
and you’ll be grounded
for life.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.959
No, we have an understanding.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.250
We have trust,
and we have--

15:38.333 --> 15:41.166
We have a problem.
He’ll be back.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.250
I don’t think he’s--
He’ll be back.

15:44.333 --> 15:45.375
[bird twitters]

15:49.834 --> 15:51.166
Come on.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.750
Kick, if we don’t get
that dog back soon,

15:53.834 --> 15:55.583
you’ll be grounded for life.

15:55.667 --> 15:56.500
Just keep your eyes open.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.500
Look.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.125
Typical Oskar--

15:59.208 --> 16:02.542
leaving a trail of destruction
everywhere he goes.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.792
Wow, we really are alike.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.333
Dog. Dog.
[whimpering]
Horrible.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.000
[people yelling]

16:12.166 --> 16:14.291
Bingo.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.750
Why even bother?
Oskar will probably run home
at some point.

16:16.834 --> 16:18.709
Because, Gunther,
I promised to watch him.

16:18.792 --> 16:22.875
Oskar’s my responsibility,
and I take my responsibilities
seriously.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.542
[people gasping]

17:16.583 --> 17:17.959
[horn honks]

17:19.542 --> 17:20.583
[honks]

17:36.083 --> 17:37.792
[Gunther]
"Mellowbrook Pound."

17:37.875 --> 17:41.750
The big house,
clink, the pokey,
the gray-bar hotel--

17:41.834 --> 17:43.250
Gunther, I get it.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.166
So what’s the plan,
you go in there
and sign Oskar out?

17:45.250 --> 17:47.625
That means paperwork,
red tape.

17:47.709 --> 17:50.083
I don’t have
that kind of time.
You mean--

17:50.166 --> 17:53.125
I’m going in.
Kick, no, it’s too dangerous.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.750
I have no choice,
Gunther.

17:54.834 --> 17:57.834
[sighs]
Then you’re going to need
this.

17:57.917 --> 17:59.542
Why do you have
the complete schematic

17:59.625 --> 18:01.834
of the Mellowbrook Dog Pound
drawn on your back?

18:01.917 --> 18:04.917
There’s some things
even friends don’t share.

18:05.041 --> 18:07.750
Hm, if this map
is correct,

18:07.834 --> 18:10.083
then there’s
a rooftop service grate

18:10.166 --> 18:12.125
between my shoulder blades.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.917
Here?
Up. Now to the left.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.041
A little more.
Little more.
And--

18:17.125 --> 18:20.000
Oh-- Oh, yeah.
That’s the spot.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.417
[delirious]
The service grate.
Ah.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.750
I don’t get it, Kick.
Why do you want to save
this mutt?

18:24.834 --> 18:26.333
All he’s ever done
is brought you grief.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.250
I didn’t get it myself,
Gunther,

18:28.333 --> 18:29.875
but I looked
into that puppy’s eyes,

18:29.959 --> 18:31.542
and I saw his soul.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.083
We’re the same, me and him,

18:33.166 --> 18:34.834
two sides of one coin,

18:34.917 --> 18:37.500
brothers
from a different mother.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.625
You’re right, Kick.
Go get him.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.083
Gunther?
Just trying to help.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.000
[barking]

19:32.583 --> 19:33.750
Oskar.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.583
Oskar, come on.
We’re going home.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.041
[grunting]

19:46.417 --> 19:47.583
Oh, biscuits.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.709
[grunts]

19:50.917 --> 19:53.000
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

19:53.083 --> 19:55.750
You want out of there,
you got to help me.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.542
Where’s the Oskar
I know and hate?

19:57.625 --> 19:59.125
The Oskar who leaves
a trail of terror

19:59.208 --> 20:00.667
everywhere he goes?

20:00.750 --> 20:02.250
The Oskar who lives to

20:02.333 --> 20:05.458
bite my Buttowski?

20:05.542 --> 20:08.333
Here, doggie, doggie,
doggie, doggie.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.750
Come and get it.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.000
[chomps]

20:11.083 --> 20:12.458
Well played, my friend.

20:12.542 --> 20:13.917
Now, let’s get you home.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.333
All right, Kick,

20:23.417 --> 20:24.792
I knew you could do it.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.458
You broke him
out of the slammer,

20:26.542 --> 20:28.667
the joint, the hoosegow,

20:28.750 --> 20:29.917
the cement condo--

20:30.000 --> 20:31.166
Gunther.
Sorry.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.875
Well, it’s getting late.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.041
You ready to go, Oskar?

20:35.125 --> 20:36.208
Biscuits.

20:36.291 --> 20:37.792
Oskar,
come back here.
Come back.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.291
[brakes squeak]

20:41.125 --> 20:43.667
Aha!

20:43.750 --> 20:45.917
I knew Kick
would mess this up.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Oh, I’m sure they’re around.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.625
[panting]

20:49.709 --> 20:51.250
Miss Chicarelli,

20:51.333 --> 20:52.792
I’ve got to tell you
something.

20:52.875 --> 20:53.834
Oskar is--

20:53.917 --> 20:55.000
he’s-- well--

20:55.083 --> 20:58.208
Yes, what is it?

20:58.291 --> 21:00.500
He, uh--
[Oskar yelps]

21:01.875 --> 21:03.875
He’s right here.

21:03.959 --> 21:05.000
Thanks, Oskar.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.625
[barks]

21:06.709 --> 21:09.083
Oh, Oskar, my little baby.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.166
I don’t believe it.
You didn’t mess it up.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.041
Now, what was it
you wanted to tell me?

21:14.125 --> 21:16.709
Just that everything’s cool
between Oskar and me.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.500
We have an understanding,
don’t we?

21:18.583 --> 21:19.834
[chomps]

21:19.917 --> 21:21.000
Oh, biscuits.

21:22.250 --> 21:27.834
[machine whirring]

21:27.917 --> 21:31.667
[sighs]
I guess it’s a good thing
I’m the sidekick.
