<i>The path to Paradise...</i>

02:35.197 --> 02:38.489
<i>is full of obstacles.</i>

03:31.105 --> 03:34.277
<i>Amazing discovery made by
the Stanford Research Institute</i>

03:34.557 --> 03:35.702
<i>in the Plain of Giza.</i>

03:36.136 --> 03:40.181
<i>The big pyramid and the Sphinx
are connected by a secret passage.</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:55.758
<i>"Upuaut VII" the micro-robot created by
the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink</i>

03:55.793 --> 04:00.437
<i>has discovered some subterranean caves
connecting these two huge structures.</i>

04:02.717 --> 04:05.863
<i>Hieroglyphic fragments suggest
that the subterranean structures</i>

04:06.255 --> 04:07.958
<i>were created by the "Shemsu Hor":</i>

04:08.424 --> 04:11.586
<i>the followers of</i> a <i>cult devoted to
the legendary Horus.</i>

04:12.360 --> 04:15.441
We are about to discover
the mythical "Way of Horus".

04:16.377 --> 04:18.754
Here are the images,
shown for the first time.

04:37.652 --> 04:42.149
The ancient Egyptians were
already using an instrument like this one

04:42.699 --> 04:46.781
to orient themselves in the
desert by following the stars.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.099
It was rediscovered
thanks to an old scroll...

04:52.134 --> 04:57.305
Remember: Every single thing
around you is part of the whole picture...

04:57.339 --> 04:59.700
Everything is connected
by an invisible thread...

05:01.051 --> 05:03.915
You just need to be able
to see the connections.

05:12.062 --> 05:18.694
We'll find right here the relics
of the Egyptian ships coasting Italy.

05:18.985 --> 05:23.604
Phaeton will no longer
be a myth. We can prove it!

05:23.639 --> 05:26.658
Abif, here we are.
It's time.

05:39.738 --> 05:43.325
THE GIZA PLATEAU, TOMORROW

06:05.640 --> 06:06.416
Hello?

06:06.451 --> 06:09.475
I found it.
Here's almost dawn.

06:10.396 --> 06:13.068
I'll send it to you via pneumatic
<i>tube...</i>

06:15.292 --> 06:16.384
Hello!

06:22.883 --> 06:24.055
What's happening?

06:24.134 --> 06:27.083
Someones here. I have to go.

06:49.247 --> 06:52.584
SANDRA TULE Ph.D
MUSEO EGIZIO
ACCADEMIA DELLE SCIENCE, TURIN, ITALY

07:45.476 --> 07:47.809
TELE TUBE

07:51.346 --> 07:55.540
THE CITY OF TURIN, 2033 A.D.
Assistant director, someone
is asking for you on the telephone.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.357
Fine. The four canonical jars of
Horus from New York need to be placed

08:00.813 --> 08:03.285
in the showcase number 33.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.326
All right, Dr. Tule.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.616
Hello?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.075
Yes, I'm coming.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.288
Something unexpected!

08:16.371 --> 08:20.296
Please, tell Professor
Al Kamar I need to go.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.920
Don't worry, Doctor. I'll tell him.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.774
Welcome to the eternal life.

08:36.933 --> 08:41.591
The borders of existence
will be definitely overcome.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.385
Your precious signature, please.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.458
Bye.

09:24.564 --> 09:29.367
Death and Nature will be astounded,

09:30.445 --> 09:33.777
when every creature will revive

09:33.812 --> 09:37.304
to answer the Judgment.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.801
The soul longing for eternity,

09:42.373 --> 09:46.496
needs to overcome the
invincible triumph of death

09:48.505 --> 09:51.672
in order to be saved.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.946
The borders of existence

09:54.981 --> 09:58.195
will be definitely overcome.

10:02.268 --> 10:06.275
Go beyond the threshold of hope.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.186
Experience it!

10:14.405 --> 10:18.126
Resurrection Day is coming,

10:20.411 --> 10:22.914
when the half-living of the Moratorium

10:23.039 --> 10:25.858
will live again.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.209
We are waiting for you.

10:31.923 --> 10:35.833
Resurrection Day is coming.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.737
<i>Offers are subject to the availability,</i>

10:40.066 --> 10:42.184
<i>terms and conditions

10:42.864 --> 10:46.030
<i>Facilitations cannot be discussed
outside estimates phase.</i>

10:46.695 --> 10:49.021
<i>Payments are not commutable

10:53.798 --> 10:57.200
The starting bid is of 10.000
post-credits, non-commutable into bonds.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.585
Other offers?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.050
Lot 515, now.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.981
Some rare fragments of an
Egyptian scroll: the date is uncertain.

11:18.970 --> 11:23.476
They come from a private collection,
but are certified by our experts.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.429
Bid starts from 50.000 post-credits,
non-commutable into bonds.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.925
Bids must be of 10.000
post-credits for the exposed code.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.934
Ladies and gentlemen, we can start.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.285
Who offers more?

11:37.739 --> 11:41.229
60.000 post-credits for the gentleman

11:42.096 --> 11:44.695

No more bids?

12:04.349 --> 12:05.771

12:05.850 --> 12:08.023
100.000 and two.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.613
100.000 and three!

12:11.022 --> 12:13.901
The item is awarded to the
gentleman, with paddle number 3.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.108
Thank you and congratulations, sir.
It's an excellent choice!

12:22.408 --> 12:25.378
We carry on, with lot 516.

12:32.398 --> 12:36.077
The third canto of the Divine Comedy
of the great poet Dante Alighieri!

12:36.506 --> 12:38.807
A volume dated the end
of the nineteenth century.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.398
The starting bid to
experience Dante's Paradise is...

12:45.894 --> 12:47.744
THE CITY OF YORK, 2033 A.D.

12:47.779 --> 12:49.234
Scan the pictures.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.788
Make two encrypted copies:
one for me and one for the institute,

12:54.823 --> 12:56.364
and then...

12:56.399 --> 12:59.717
You can remove a
tiny fragment for DNA

13:00.697 --> 13:02.714
and radiocarbon testing.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.792
I want to know
where this came from.

13:04.826 --> 13:09.009
Well, it looks like
Cyperus Papyrus, Professor.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.833
But the test will
take a least a week.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.554
We can wait.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.841
You can do these scans.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.715
I'm going to make
a few phone calls and...

13:19.590 --> 13:22.833
I want to visit one
of my true colleagues.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.981
We got the results today.

13:35.606 --> 13:39.751
This is part of the Turin Canon.

13:39.861 --> 13:43.689
Unfortunately, the most
important part is missing.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.752
That could be a
connection to the Seven Sages.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.499
The Book of the Foundation.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.748
The followers of Horus.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.766
The builders of the sacred cities.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.004
That's just amazing.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.255
Yeah.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.361
You must have paid
a fortune for these...

14:14.645 --> 14:16.898
You even got them
past the Shuster Control.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.367
It's damn fantastic!

14:22.779 --> 14:30.946
Dante, these days everything is
just a flow of digital data, one click away.

14:30.981 --> 14:34.833
Not even Oligarchs could
afford these relics of the past.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.899
It's just a partial
fortune, sadly. Let's sit.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.679
I used to smoke.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.190
That's the only
thing my Father left me.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.400
It's the only real thing
beside all these memories.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.530
Funny, isn't it'? Today
it's a totally useless object.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.200
Another vanish utopia.

15:10.436 --> 15:11.431
Yeah.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.110
I want to get to
that missing piece.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.710
Maybe was misfiled in
some different document.

15:19.745 --> 15:23.087
You could go to Turin.
- To check the catalogs!

15:25.091 --> 15:26.468
I can't leave my mother.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.303
Yes, I know she needs you.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.810
I love her, too.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.778
Shes not getting better.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.300
We can wait, don't be long.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.613
All right?
 <i>Ok.</i>

15:46.237 --> 15:47.705
You may need help.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.733
No, I prefer to dive
alone. You know me.

16:05.631 --> 16:09.206
Here, this is the point.
- Yes, I see.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.269
Look, this is your father.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.794
What's happening?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.975
Shit...
- What?

16:45.296 --> 16:47.889
He's coming up too fast.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.685
Are you Ok?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.856
Follow your heart...

17:46.607 --> 17:51.113
The light of your
most brilliant star...

17:51.237 --> 17:54.582
will lead you to the roots...

17:54.615 --> 17:57.162
to the Truth...

17:58.369 --> 18:02.258
There lies the secret...

18:46.042 --> 18:48.420
She never wanted to
end up in a Moratorium,

18:48.502 --> 18:51.756
bound to a thermic
decay-suspension machine.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.516
Hanging between life and death.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.430
Lingering in that bubble,
just to be able to talk to her

18:58.554 --> 19:00.431
for a couple of minutes a year.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.692
And death...

19:08.939 --> 19:10.532
shall have no dominion.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.038
Dead man naked they shall be one

19:17.823 --> 19:21.202
with the man in the
wind and the west moon.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.164
When their bones are picked clean

19:24.205 --> 19:26.207
and the clean bones gone,

19:26.707 --> 19:29.335
they shall have
stars at elbow and foot.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.433
Though they sink through
the sea they shall rise again.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.562
Though lovers be lost

19:39.595 --> 19:42.064
love shall not.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.691
And death...

19:44.725 --> 19:46.978
shall have no dominion.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.489
Welcome to the eternal life.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.215
Resurrection Day is coming.

20:09.625 --> 20:15.598
When every creature will
revive to answer the Judgment.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.135
It's time to wake up.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.142
I'm Mr. Adams.
I'm looking for Mr. Shu.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.478
The references from Prof. Moonlight
grants you the necessary authorization.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.733
You are now a root user" of
our system. A big privilege, no doubt.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.866
But...

20:35.359 --> 20:38.659
Actually, we've not been informed
about the object of your research.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.408
I'm looking for information
about the movements of

20:42.533 --> 20:46.754
some fragments of an ancient
scroll... connected to the Turin Canon.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.624
You can find the
coordinates in my badge.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.292
Good, Professor Adams,

20:51.375 --> 20:54.299
I'm going to make a quick
research in the digital archives.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.881
In the meantime,
could you please... - Sure.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.433
Excellent! Thank you sir.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.556
Thank you.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.434
Let me see...

21:13.564 --> 21:16.192
No, that's really strange though.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.696
Maybe the notification is missing.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.077
Ok don't worry, no problem.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.296
We could try some
information in the paper archives.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.208
Could you please wait here?
- For sure, no problem.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.838
According to the
Shuster law, in order to...

21:36.921 --> 21:40.846
to get access to the archive, you
need an authorization from the Ministry.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.597
Your references are not
enough. You understand?

21:46.430 --> 21:50.185
You could try talking
to the former director,

21:50.226 --> 21:52.729
Professor Fahrid AI Kamar:

21:52.853 --> 21:55.606
he knew the content of
the museum piece by piece.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.484
He spent his life
among papers and papers.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.738
I know he lives in a small
village not far from here.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.493
Good morning,

22:03.614 --> 22:05.616
I'm looking for Professor Al Kamar.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.960
Do you know him?

22:08.494 --> 22:09.871
I am a researcher.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.000
The Egyptian Museum
of Turin sent me here.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.343
You are a colleague, then...

22:17.127 --> 22:20.757
You go out of the shop and
turn right into the small alley.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.260
After fifty meters
you'll find an arch.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.855
The Professors house
gate is right there.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.641
Thank you, sir.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.170
You're not going to
find him there though now.

22:59.253 --> 23:02.678
He spends all his time
inside a cave in the woods.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.634
It's not far from here.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.139
No'

25:11.802 --> 25:13.304
It's impossible...

25:13.387 --> 25:16.391
No, father wake up.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.902
Wake up! Father!

25:20.936 --> 25:23.689
No, do not leave me alone...

25:30.029 --> 25:31.827
Let me stay here... Father!

25:33.699 --> 25:34.825
Father!

25:34.908 --> 25:36.080
No!

25:38.328 --> 25:39.705
Father!

25:42.291 --> 25:44.965
I want to see my father!

25:53.302 --> 25:54.428
Father!

25:55.804 --> 25:57.351
Father!

26:18.619 --> 26:21.623
Rest in peace, my friend.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.919
<i>Ehâ€œ.!</i>

27:43.453 --> 27:44.579
Who are you?

27:45.455 --> 27:47.457
Don't worry, Professor. I'm Arthur
Adams.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.210
I am an archeologist from York.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.340
What do you want?

27:51.420 --> 27:54.299
I'm Professor Moonlight's assistant.
You should know him.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.556
Moonlight?

27:56.466 --> 27:57.809
Professor Al Kamar?

27:57.843 --> 27:58.935
Yes...

28:00.095 --> 28:01.563
so they say.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.225
I'm doing some researches
on an ancient document.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.731
You are the only
one who can help me.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.565
Which document?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.364
The missing fragment
of the Turin Canon!

28:19.448 --> 28:20.870
It's not so easy.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.460
Not here. Not now.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.500
Meet me at San Lorenz
church. At sunset.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.631
You must go now, boy.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.094
Go!

29:27.933 --> 29:29.685
Ah, you're here, already!

29:29.768 --> 29:31.315
What's going on?

29:31.812 --> 29:34.065
Listen to me, boy.
This is very important:

29:34.147 --> 29:38.698
the place where we met is the
tomb of an ancient Egyptian queen.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.821
These walls...

29:40.904 --> 29:43.828
gives us clues for understanding
the scroll you're looking for.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.952
Look over there,
do you see those roses?

29:48.161 --> 29:51.961
The corn, Hermes...
even the Pelican, too.

29:52.916 --> 29:56.716
These stones tell us that this place
was once an ancient Egyptian site,

29:57.462 --> 29:59.430
linked to the cult of Horus.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.842
<i>Yes...</i> but what about the scroll?

30:03.218 --> 30:04.720
Another time.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.864
Professor Al Kamar?

30:25.198 --> 30:28.247
It's Arthur Adams,
it's midnight! Our meeting...

30:29.494 --> 30:30.620
Professor?

30:46.636 --> 30:47.888
Who did this?

30:48.889 --> 30:50.857
The women knows why.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.603
Go find her!

30:54.394 --> 30:55.520
Your car.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.023
Wait.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.616
See this!

31:01.860 --> 31:03.237
I took it away from the Museum...

31:03.278 --> 31:05.497
to keep it safe...

31:06.281 --> 31:07.658
It ism

31:08.116 --> 31:10.164
the fragment you are looking for.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.167
The Egyptian queen came here

31:13.246 --> 31:15.999
to found the new
the city of the Sun,

31:16.041 --> 31:18.260
for her father Akhenaton.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.923
This is the new
sacred land of the Egyptians...

31:24.383 --> 31:26.431
Put me down.
- Yes.

31:30.305 --> 31:33.559
Be careful!

31:33.642 --> 31:35.269
Shemsu Hor.

31:37.813 --> 31:38.939
Who are you?

31:43.068 --> 31:44.285
SALIGIA.

32:35.579 --> 32:36.956
I hope you well.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.505
It's the first murder
I have seen in this area.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.882
The killer has no identity.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.255
Unrecognizable.

32:45.255 --> 32:46.381
No badge,

32:47.215 --> 32:49.843
and the fingerprints have
been removed with acid.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.887
It's terrible!

32:56.224 --> 32:58.898
We'll need a couple of
hours for the retina recognition.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.272
And the people at Moratorium...

33:01.396 --> 33:04.366
I hope they will get something
out of that brain. It's a mess.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.986
What are you doing in this area?

33:08.028 --> 33:09.530
I am a University assistant,

33:09.654 --> 33:11.873
specialized in Egyptology.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.034
Well, then you were a
colleague of the director?

33:14.159 --> 33:17.163
You could say so, just met
him today for the first time.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.632
Please, do not leave
the area for the time being.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.884
I will probably need
to talk to you again.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.171
I have a room at the Sun Hotel.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.514
You can find me there.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.951
<i>Destination set.</i>

34:17.973 --> 34:20.351
Can I come in... please... can I?

34:21.226 --> 34:22.944
It's you... again?

34:23.436 --> 34:26.485
What do you want from me?
I don't want to see you anymore!

34:26.565 --> 34:29.489
I'm sorry...
I just wanted to...

34:30.443 --> 34:32.571
Oh... I'm sorry,
I thought you were...

34:33.071 --> 34:34.869
No, don't worry, ifs my fault...

34:35.614 --> 34:38.458
I'm not used to get inside
peoples houses like this, trust me.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.875
I got your address
from professor Al Kamar.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.623
Are you Miss Sarah Eve?

34:42.746 --> 34:44.215
Yes, it's me...

34:44.623 --> 34:48.128
ls the professor all right?
I haven't seen him for a long time.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.882
I'm sorry the Professor
was killed last night.

34:59.389 --> 35:00.390
How did it happen?

35:00.515 --> 35:02.267
I was there...
I tried to help him...

35:02.392 --> 35:03.518
too late...

35:04.269 --> 35:05.896
I'm sorry. Do you
want me to pass by later?

35:06.021 --> 35:07.364
Yes, thank you...

35:08.273 --> 35:10.275
Maybe it's better if I stay alone.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.279
Wait!

35:15.530 --> 35:17.248
There's something else
you wanted to tell me, right?

35:17.282 --> 35:18.625
Well... ah'..

35:19.743 --> 35:22.792
The professor left me a
last message... Or so I believe...

35:23.413 --> 35:26.007
He told me to contact you in
case something happened to him.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.383
I'm Arthur...

35:27.417 --> 35:30.421
Arthur Adams, I am an
archaeological researcher...

35:30.503 --> 35:33.177
I came hereto get some
informations on an ancient scroll.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.643
The Professor was the
only one who could help me...

35:36.676 --> 35:39.179
I think the murder is
connected to this ancient document'

35:39.429 --> 35:41.431
Did you know anything
about his researches?

35:41.514 --> 35:42.640
No...

35:43.308 --> 35:45.561
I just gave him
some artistic counseling...

35:46.311 --> 35:47.563
I am a painter.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.149
I've been working on the
restoration of some sarcophagi.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.446
But...

35:52.817 --> 35:54.569
Why was he killed?

35:57.572 --> 36:00.041
This was lying on
the Professor's face.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.922
I think it's a copy... but
it looks very ancient, indeed.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.219
If it's a copy...

36:19.302 --> 36:21.430
a master might have done it.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.934
I'll give you the contact
of a top forensic consultant.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.728
He's a good friend of mine.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.570
Tell him I'm sending you.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.612
I don't know anybody in this town.
Could you please come with me?

36:33.692 --> 36:36.241
I would be glad...
plus is your friend.

36:36.486 --> 36:39.740
I am too busy working...
I really can't... I'm sorry.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.621
My office could pay you well...

36:48.998 --> 36:50.966
I'm so happy to see you...

36:51.376 --> 36:52.878
But you never call...

36:56.881 --> 36:58.258
This is Professor Arthur Adams.

36:58.341 --> 36:59.763
Arthur is fine.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.641
A mistake of my youth.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.523
Here's a small present for you...

37:09.227 --> 37:10.604
A real mystery.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.366
What do you think it is?

37:15.775 --> 37:16.901
Just a moment.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.537
Do you think is
gonna find connections?

37:25.034 --> 37:27.628
Connections seem invisible,

37:27.662 --> 37:30.632
but they are just
hidden behind the surface.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.297
You simply scratch...

37:33.376 --> 37:36.004
and they burst
out, like fireworks.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.925
Only those who
have eyes to see...

37:41.009 --> 37:43.637
can spot them... of course.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.430
You know...

37:46.890 --> 37:48.437
he's a strange guy...

37:50.143 --> 37:51.565
a man of science...

37:53.688 --> 37:55.531
He knows a lot about religion,

37:55.565 --> 37:57.818
Kabala, even metaphysics.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.406
He's a pure researcher...
with no prejudices.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.659
He puts no limit
to knowledge... - No...

38:06.701 --> 38:08.419
it's not just a replica,

38:08.453 --> 38:11.423
not a recent one, at least...

38:12.415 --> 38:15.339
It must be dating
back to the XVI century.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.171
The brushstrokes...

38:18.963 --> 38:20.340
they seem...

38:21.216 --> 38:23.184
Hieronymus Bosch!

38:23.718 --> 38:27.973
Let's call a friend of mine...
An enlightened mind, a real expert.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.059
Just a moment.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.854
What did I tell you?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.234
He's just a bit weird.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.614
It's me, how are you doing?

38:44.197 --> 38:45.995
I need to talk to you.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.629
... I would like to end
my speech with this book,

38:56.125 --> 39:01.507
In it... you'll find the analysis of
the relationships between two groups.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.468
One had been:
the Faithful of Love,

39:04.509 --> 39:07.513
which Dante was
undoubtedly a member.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.101
The other had been:
the Brotherhood of the Free Spirit,

39:13.226 --> 39:15.775
which no doubt
Bosch was an attendant.

39:16.396 --> 39:20.401
Both groups were aware
of the Egyptian philosophy

39:21.109 --> 39:24.113
and the ideas of
the Followers of Horus.

39:25.029 --> 39:29.250
Curiously, both
men were interested

39:29.284 --> 39:32.154
in the seven deadly sins...

39:32.912 --> 39:35.882
It been said that both men

39:35.915 --> 39:40.376
were particularly sparing.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.336
I'm myself...

39:45.550 --> 39:47.810
guilty of that vice.

39:50.388 --> 39:55.019
This text is...
extremely expensive.

39:57.395 --> 40:01.675
In conclusion,
I like to read you something...

40:02.901 --> 40:05.707
I think you may understand.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.539
This tercet from the Paradise,

40:09.949 --> 40:13.852
where Dante talks
about the mystical Rose.

40:15.079 --> 40:20.118
<i>"The Love, beneath whose warmth
this flower has grown in eternal peace,</i>

40:20.585 --> 40:23.629
<i>flamed once
again in your womb.</i>

40:33.306 --> 40:36.310
Listen Tully... we've
found a piece of canvas,

40:36.351 --> 40:39.321
it looks like Bosch's, it's Pride...

40:39.354 --> 40:42.820
I've heard that story
as a rumor, a legend.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.909
Bosch created a
series of drawings,

40:46.944 --> 40:49.099
before settling them into one.

40:49.134 --> 40:50.884
A guy came to see me,

40:51.824 --> 40:54.709
and he was asking
me a lot of questions...

40:55.244 --> 40:56.962
about the drawings.

40:58.623 --> 41:03.453
He was mentioning
some kind of plot...

41:04.587 --> 41:05.830
You see!

41:06.005 --> 41:10.001
So, I think he was nuts... mad.

41:11.514 --> 41:12.457
A crazy man.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.371
So, I send him off
I told him to go away.

41:18.595 --> 41:19.851
But I remember his name:

41:21.896 --> 41:23.467
<i>Frank Mare.</i>

41:24.524 --> 41:27.387
As a poet Virgil surname.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.950
Thank you very much,
Taron. Ok, see you later.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.679
He found this guy, Frank Maro.

41:38.037 --> 41:41.878
He's been busted a few times
for violence and intimidation.

41:42.792 --> 41:46.951
He's now living in an
underground area of the town... slums.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.814
A shelter for thieves
and invisible people.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.583
So, let's go.

41:58.933 --> 42:02.384
Look! People call it the Gate of Hell...

42:02.895 --> 42:04.781
a mysterious place.

42:39.599 --> 42:43.430
Attention, don't come in.
It's dangerous for you!

42:57.450 --> 43:00.125
We're looking for a
man called Frank Maro.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.262
Can you help us?
- What do you want? Go away!

43:06.000 --> 43:07.377
Come on!

43:25.394 --> 43:26.395
No.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.276
He will be good to you
if you don't challenge him...

43:32.276 --> 43:34.589
He's Gengis...

43:34.779 --> 43:37.009
I know where to find
the man you are looking for...

43:37.740 --> 43:38.978
I can help you.

43:39.013 --> 43:41.227
But, he's the one
who set the price.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.644
I know where
you can find him...

44:07.812 --> 44:09.439
I can bring you to him...

44:09.522 --> 44:12.321
It will be expensive though...

44:12.692 --> 44:13.909
How much?

44:14.694 --> 44:18.264
Let's say a 50
post-credits pass gallery.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.497
A 30 post-credits pass is enough!

44:27.790 --> 44:29.463
Ok, let's go.

44:30.710 --> 44:32.428
The pass, first!

45:15.880 --> 45:16.972
Arthur.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.509
Arthur, let's go.
- Sure.

46:33.666 --> 46:35.714
<i>Follow your heart...</i>

46:36.669 --> 46:40.808
<i>The light of your
most brilliant star...</i>

46:41.514 --> 46:42.550
<i>will lead you to the roots...</i>

46:42.591 --> 46:45.874
<i>to the Truth...</i>

46:57.857 --> 46:59.936
Here we are, it's him.

47:02.862 --> 47:04.455
Who the hell are you?

47:06.198 --> 47:08.558
You've come here to kill me, right?

47:09.744 --> 47:13.272
I know nothing,
I've seen nothing.

47:14.373 --> 47:18.154
Get away... leave me alone!
- Don't worry, we don't mean to hurt you.

47:18.711 --> 47:21.601
Don't be scared, we
only want informations, Ok?

47:25.468 --> 47:26.845
What?

47:27.219 --> 47:29.041
James, are you Ok?
- Fuck.

47:29.076 --> 47:30.289
Get him out of here.

47:30.514 --> 47:34.198
Take him away! I'll be
after you. - Son of the bitch.

47:34.233 --> 47:34.393
Let's go away!

47:35.519 --> 47:37.353
They're looking for me.

47:37.447 --> 47:42.715
I'm coming...

47:43.523 --> 47:44.893
I'm coming with you...

47:46.084 --> 47:47.044
Wait for me, please.

47:48.254 --> 47:50.247
I'm coming with you!

48:24.318 --> 48:25.695
You must help us...

48:25.778 --> 48:29.032
You must tell us everything you
know about Bosch's paintings. Ok?

48:29.073 --> 48:32.950
We will protect you, I
garantie, don't be scared.

48:33.202 --> 48:36.431
You don't know
who these guys are.

48:38.707 --> 48:42.448
You can't imagine.
They can reach everywhere...

48:42.670 --> 48:44.945
nothing can stop them.

48:45.464 --> 48:46.698
Nobody can!

48:46.733 --> 48:48.411
They... they... Who are "they"?

48:48.467 --> 48:50.171
Frank, please, listen to me.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.780
You must help us, now!

48:54.348 --> 48:55.547
Please.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.283
It's too dangerous...

48:57.852 --> 49:00.468
For me, for you Miss...

49:01.689 --> 49:03.443
and for everybody.

49:04.316 --> 49:05.484
Believe me!

49:06.861 --> 49:10.580
It's for your own good.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.422
For everybody's good.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.679
Who knows about this story?

49:16.871 --> 49:18.123
There's a writer...

49:19.373 --> 49:23.094
He's living in a small
village in the mountains...

49:25.379 --> 49:26.631
He's a Count...

49:27.756 --> 49:29.099
Rosebud...

49:30.384 --> 49:34.255
He's been living
and working there all his life.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.575
The name, damn it!

49:37.266 --> 49:39.311
His name is Francis Rosebud.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.321
I know nothing else about him.

49:42.521 --> 49:48.425
He's the heir of the
Count who built the village.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.718
I hope you're not
trying to trick us!

49:53.782 --> 49:55.261
I'm not cheating.

49:59.788 --> 50:01.794
I know very little about all this.

50:04.668 --> 50:07.592
The other ones know...

50:09.048 --> 50:10.925
I have nothing to do with it.

50:11.050 --> 50:13.097
Nothing! Nothing!

50:13.761 --> 50:17.832
Why did they want to
hide the truth? - I don't know.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.105
I don't know!

50:22.019 --> 50:23.840
They're very dangerous people.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.650
But Rosebud...

50:28.442 --> 50:29.694
I know...

50:30.444 --> 50:32.833
he wanted to talk.

50:33.405 --> 50:36.705
Yes, he has written things that...

50:38.702 --> 50:39.996
That's enough for me.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.203
I don't know anything else.

50:45.209 --> 50:46.442
Leave me alone...

50:47.670 --> 50:51.675
Leave me alone!

50:59.723 --> 51:01.851
That's all we can
get from this man...

51:02.935 --> 51:04.937
using this white-glove
treatment, at least.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.449
Look... look what they
say about the Count.

51:09.984 --> 51:12.112
He's a scientist, a mathematician...

51:13.237 --> 51:16.435
He's discovered some links
between the works of Nicolas Tesla

51:16.740 --> 51:20.611
and a mysterious structure
hidden inside the Pyramid of Cheops,

51:20.619 --> 51:22.189
the Zed!

51:22.871 --> 51:25.757
Hes been expelled by the
University on a charge of molesting.

51:26.333 --> 51:29.933
Here, at an essays
presentation, he's with a model...

51:31.005 --> 51:33.492
They look very intimate.
Can we trace her down?

51:34.258 --> 51:35.428
No... no she's not a model...

51:35.807 --> 51:39.818
She's an agent of a
para-governmental organization of the big "Z".

51:40.514 --> 51:43.056
It's an escort service
for the oligarchs.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.696
They're called "Priss"
"High pleasure models".

51:46.270 --> 51:48.648
I've questioned her for
an ongoing investigation,

51:48.772 --> 51:50.552
but she's not involved.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.425
Well, I can contact the girl...

51:52.985 --> 51:55.218
Then I can arrange
a meeting if you want...

51:55.529 --> 51:57.372
We're making a TV show

51:57.406 --> 51:59.666
about magic towns
and we need a presenter.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.859
We've saw you in an article
about the Count of Rosebud.

52:02.894 --> 52:05.188
Our show is starting
precisely over there.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.525
A strange coincidence, isn't it?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.250
Yes, I love coincidences...

52:10.544 --> 52:13.172
They attract me and
scare me all the same.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.799
Do you personally know the Count?

52:14.882 --> 52:16.509
We'd like to talk
to him and meet him...

52:16.550 --> 52:18.033
to gather informations
for our TV show.

52:18.802 --> 52:23.210
The Count is an excellent
customer, very gentle and kind.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.450
Yesterday, I was with him.

52:26.393 --> 52:30.313
Sometimes he invites me to
his place. A really ghostly place.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.593
If you go there... you
could have your arm healed.

52:34.818 --> 52:36.794
There is a mysterious woman, Althea,

52:37.029 --> 52:39.899
living next to the village church.

52:40.199 --> 52:43.771
She's a real healer and you
can ask her for information, too...

52:44.078 --> 52:46.794
Shes spent her
entire life in the village.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.171
Where she was born.

53:05.474 --> 53:07.682
I was waiting for you...

53:16.985 --> 53:18.828
I've a constant pain in my arm.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.635
It's there, since
I was badly wounded...

53:20.670 --> 53:21.948
Let me see...

53:25.494 --> 53:27.077
Yes...

53:28.747 --> 53:31.663
yes, I can do something.
Wait for me here.

53:53.021 --> 53:55.114
How do you heal the sick
people who come to see you?

53:55.858 --> 53:59.466
All my ancestors had
a gift and were healers...

53:59.501 --> 54:01.225
My mother before me,

54:01.238 --> 54:03.073
her mother before her...

54:03.782 --> 54:05.226
and so on,

54:05.617 --> 54:09.866
from immemorial time...
the touch of the Mascaa

54:10.936 --> 54:13.017
is a gift, not a job...

54:14.126 --> 54:15.423
it's a mission.

54:16.879 --> 54:19.678
My ancestors got their
Art directly from Thoth,

54:19.757 --> 54:22.010
the ancient god of Medicine.

54:32.811 --> 54:34.404
Can I ask you something?

54:34.438 --> 54:37.178
Of course, my dear, tell me.

54:38.692 --> 54:42.601
We've come here to find
a man: the Count Rosebud.

54:44.448 --> 54:46.542
I guessed it, of course.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.293
Can you help us?

54:49.161 --> 54:50.708
Francis was born here.

54:52.289 --> 54:55.007
He bears the same
name of his ancestor,

54:55.042 --> 54:58.963
the nobleman who built the
village. But hes very different.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.798
He has wasted all his
money in some unclear business.

55:02.216 --> 55:04.059
He lives with his sister,

55:05.552 --> 55:06.661
a strange woman...

55:07.230 --> 55:11.029
She never comes to the village,
she spends all her time in the cemetery.

55:11.350 --> 55:13.629
Her son died
immediately after birth,

55:13.936 --> 55:16.824
no chance to put him
in the Moratorium, too young.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.680
A fatherless son.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.720
Francis never comes
to the village either.

55:28.492 --> 55:31.290
They live in the castle
above the village.

56:07.656 --> 56:08.908
It's her, I guess.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.414
Let's go and talk to her.

56:14.788 --> 56:16.381
Sorry to bother you, Madam.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.922
We're looking for
the Countess Rosebud.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.247
Can you help us?

56:21.295 --> 56:23.954
Young Countess...
The young Countess...

56:24.381 --> 56:25.428
Yes.

56:30.679 --> 56:33.586
Yes, it's me.
What do you want?

56:34.057 --> 56:37.346
We're looking for your
brother, the Count Francis.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.717
And what do you want from him?

56:40.397 --> 56:43.250
Miss Nora Segni told us
we could find him here.

56:43.525 --> 56:47.635
We wanted to talk to him
about the origins of Rosebud.

56:48.447 --> 56:51.813
He's in town for some
business. He will be back tonight.

56:52.034 --> 56:53.707
You can find him
at the village inn.

56:53.827 --> 56:57.313
He spends his dinner
time there, with his friends.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.274
I have to go now.

57:11.219 --> 57:13.924
I will tell him
about your visit.

57:15.182 --> 57:16.479
Don't worry!

57:30.614 --> 57:32.332
I'm glad you come with me.

57:35.243 --> 57:37.211
My arm... ls not aching anymore...

57:38.497 --> 57:40.625
Did you know,
everywhere we look,

57:40.707 --> 57:42.709
there his some traces of Egypt.

57:44.127 --> 57:45.970
Maybe, we are
on the right track...

57:46.004 --> 57:47.381
or maybe...

57:49.591 --> 57:51.389
it's just your imagination.

57:52.010 --> 57:53.387
Yeah.

57:56.890 --> 58:02.443
The Countess has just called.
The Count is inviting you to his castle.

58:05.273 --> 58:07.555
They live in the castle.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.112
Follow those alleys,

58:10.153 --> 58:14.195
pass under...
our magic door...

58:15.033 --> 58:17.035
reach the fountain of live...

58:17.160 --> 58:21.078
go staight... and there you are.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.180
Please, come in.

58:36.888 --> 58:38.631
Thank you.

58:49.443 --> 58:51.872
My brother is waiting for you.

59:02.164 --> 59:07.312
Welcome... thank you for
accepting my suddenly invitation.

59:07.461 --> 59:09.561
I hope I can help you.

59:17.471 --> 59:19.074
Please.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.659
My dear "friend", Nora...

59:26.480 --> 59:30.235
told me you are interested in
making a TV show about Rosebud.

59:30.358 --> 59:34.132
Yes, we are preparing a series
about the magic towns of Piedmont.

59:34.167 --> 59:37.786
I've been studying the
same subject for many years.

59:37.991 --> 59:41.804
It looks like the
whole area of Piedmont

59:42.329 --> 59:44.852
has the shape of a huge town...

59:45.749 --> 59:50.754
with precise mathematical
proportions. An open-sky sanctuary.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.811
A heritage from
the Egyptian models.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.539
Far more than this,

59:57.574 --> 01:00:00.228
every architectural model...

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:05.348
is in perfect harmony
with the human proportions,

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.469
I've been searching for perfection
through the body my whole life.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:16.623
I'm especially interested
in the female shape...

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.696
As my master Tesla,
I consider the female body

01:00:21.731 --> 01:00:26.079
as the symbol of
the primordial energy.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.120
The human body as
an energy transmitter...

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:36.136
Wait a minute. I want
to show you something.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.816
Don't worry about
the Shuster Law, my friends...

01:00:55.694 --> 01:01:02.424
Now, have a close look: the Tesla's
Tower has the same structure of the Zed.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.899
Here the Zed is
inserted in the Ankh key...

01:01:08.849 --> 01:01:12.090
Tesla was prevented
from ending his <i>work...</i>

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:13.706
so bad.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:20.469
Let's go back to Rosebud, now...

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:24.227
That's the reason
of your visit, right? - Yes.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:28.606
This area has been
breeding many Master Masons,

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:33.316
skillful about alchemical
and hermetic symbols.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:37.069
Nicolao, the famous stone-cutter,

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:41.898
was working in the
nearby Abbey of St. Michael.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.745
The Abbey of St. Michael...

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.622
The Abbey of St. Michael...

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:52.203
is one of the Gates of Heaven.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:55.004
As Rosebud: a sacred place.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.382
My ancestor was
a very influent man...

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:03.137
in this hall, many important
figures of the XIX century

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.231
have gathered
from all over Europe.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.993
Look at the Starry Sky...

01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:16.011
it's the last relic of
those bright times.

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:43.203
Sorry to bother
you, Count. It's for you.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.703
Thank you.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:47.332
Excuse me.

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:54.713
Hello?

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.004
Thank you.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.848
Sorry, a friend's in trouble.

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:08.614
But we can talk
again tomorrow, right?

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.919
<i>Em, who are you?</i>

01:05:54.462 --> 01:05:57.397
<i>This is the Police, are
you Arthur Adams?</i> - Yeah.

01:05:57.432 --> 01:05:59.764
<i>Sorry, but Mr. Moonlight
has been killed.</i>

01:05:59.799 --> 01:06:01.242
What?

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:03.068
How did happen?

01:06:03.103 --> 01:06:06.396
<i>We can't give you information,
you've to come here immediately.</i>

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:12.511
Of course, no informations.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:16.974
<i>We don't have a clue,
we've only an ancient painting.</i>

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.393
What, a painting?

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.270
<i>Yeah, I've to
come here tomorrow.</i>

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:26.084
No, I'm coming
right now, immediately.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.657
There is no
reason for this murder.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:32.059
You know Agent, when I
was in Italy for my researches.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.577
A similar murder
happened there, same patterns...

01:06:38.886 --> 01:06:40.491
I think they're connected.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:44.793
You can ask for information
from the agent Taron Irons in Turin...

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.530
Just a second, please.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:03.371
York's agent here, detective
McGuire. Are you the agent Iron?

01:07:03.406 --> 01:07:05.567
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>
- Do you know Mr. Adams?

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.076
<i>Yes, S know him.
He's a very good guy.</i>

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.780
<i>I guarantee for him.</i>

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.358
<i>He's not involved in this murder.</i>

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.036
You were right.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.663
The Italian agent witnessed for you...

01:07:21.698 --> 01:07:24.310
But, please, remain at our disposal.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.092
Professor Ludwig Adrian Moonlight

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.311
has made you his universal heir.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.607
He left a small part of
his fortune to the Foundation.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.072
He must have
loved you very much.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.976
He was like a father to me...

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:45.733
My mentor.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.232
This was included in Moonlighfs...

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:50.446
last will.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.118
I leave you here.

01:08:02.597 --> 01:08:04.033
IDENTITY
CONFIRMED

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:12.630
<i>Arthur...</i>

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:15.761
<i>you were like a son to me.</i>

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:21.488
So <i>I decided to make you
my heir in every sense.</i>

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:25.890
<i>I trust you will find the
way to follow your destiny...</i>

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:29.203
<i>and continue our
search without me.</i>

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.149
Remember,

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:35.444
<i>the true nature of
things is always hidden.</i>

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.948
<i>This is your journey.</i>

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.104
<i>Be strong!</i>

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.535
<i>Be yourself...</i>

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.950
<i>and be goddamn genius!</i>

01:08:46.613 --> 01:08:49.501
<i>Good Luck, my boy.</i>

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:02.805
And then the notary
gave me a postal package,

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.721
a confidential box... and a letter.

01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:10.563
Inside, there was the
missing scroll. - And the letter?

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:12.310
It was totally in
the Professor's style.

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.703
He wrote me about a
task I've to accomplish.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.814
We've to go back
to the Egyptian Museum.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.844
Everything started over there.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.026
There must be something I'm missing.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.487
We've to dig inside the
paper archives. - No, it's crazy.

01:09:28.522 --> 01:09:30.862
It's a major violation
of the Shuster's law.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:32.586
We'll end up in jail!

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.144
No one can enter
in the archives, Ok?

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:39.308
It's too dangerous.
- Nothing is impossible.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:42.925
A dear friend of mine
is working in the archives.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.212
What are you doing?
Go back to your bed!

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:49.182
No time to rest. I'm fine.

01:09:57.055 --> 01:09:58.600
Esther, it's nice to see you.

01:09:58.635 --> 01:10:01.471
It's a long time.
Can we go? - Yeah.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.077
It's done.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:07.532
Esther will let us
get inside the archives.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.589
But you have
to be very careful.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.413
Just the two of them...

01:10:12.448 --> 01:10:15.008
You stay here with me.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:18.997
There are so many
things you have to tell me.

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:21.134
Ok, then.

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:25.972
Pay attention, and look at
every detail that can help us.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.735
Thank you.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:34.970
So...

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:15.469
I go this way, you
can go the other. - Ok.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.177
Sarah, are you Ok?

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:45.935
Sarah, where are you?
Are you all right?

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:56.241
Are you Ok? - Why...
didn't you answer me?

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.313
I heard you... but
I didn't want to scream.

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:02.979
I was far from you,
trying to find the light switch.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.851
It switched off automatically.

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:08.930
Are you Ok?

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:12.130
I feel better. I feel better
now. What did you find?

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.712
I just had a look.

01:13:14.747 --> 01:13:18.017
Inside this folder there's a
document mentioning our scroll...

01:13:18.052 --> 01:13:20.018
and the followers of Horus

01:13:20.053 --> 01:13:22.292
connected with
the seven deadly sins.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.446
They mention the god Thot

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:28.429
and strange links with
Dante, Egypt and Bosch.

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:32.893
The author of the document
is a woman: Sandra Tule.

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:37.342
Here, she talks about something
kept in the Abbey of St. Michael.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.168
We've to show this
document immediately to James,

01:13:40.203 --> 01:13:42.208
maybe he can find
other connections. - Ok.

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:48.629
AUTHORIZED
PERSONNEL
ONLY

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:58.730
We've found something.

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:07.490
St. Michael...
St. Michael Abbey.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:37.257
My friends...
welcome to Paradise.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.128
I'm father Hugo.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.646
I assume, you're here
to see the Abbey? - Yes.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.839
As you can see,

01:14:44.874 --> 01:14:47.934
Paradise is difficult to reach!

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.486
Your friend seems like is not in
condition for such a difficult walk.

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:56.993
Perhaps I can get
in the car with you,

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.729
we go to the main gate
and then we can walk from there.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:02.095
Thank you. Thank you very
much. - Thank you. - Lovely.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:11.145
Sooner or later this
road is going to kill me.

01:15:14.114 --> 01:15:16.379
If not that, the beer
and the sandwiches will.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:21.313
Anyway,

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.619
it's better to go with
a full stomach, yes?

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:28.283
And surely, the air
of this sacred place

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:30.531
will have me go as a happy man!

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.636
Thank you for you company.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:37.526
Enjoy the Abbey.
- Thank you.

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.825
I'm going to the
dining hall, after...

01:15:40.673 --> 01:15:43.714
such a rigorous walk, one
should've something of substance.

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.474
Enjoy.

01:16:25.106 --> 01:16:26.441
It was carved by Nicolao.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:47.144
My friends are still here.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.252
Excellent!

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:56.534
How about I take you for
a behind-the-scenes tour?

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.127
And how about you?

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:05.413
Are you coming?

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.416
Yes, I'm coming...

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:10.759
Maybe that man
wants to come, too...

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.284
What man?

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.901
No, he's not there anymore.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:26.813
As I was saying before,

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:29.190
the Abbey is dedicated
to the Archangel Michael.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.439
Here, he's crushing the
tempting devil. As you know,

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:34.401
the temptations of
Satan can be intense...

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:36.694
and only the Saints can resist them.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:39.295
One temptation I
can't resist is: Gluttony.

01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:41.848
Why everybody always
blames the gluttons?

01:17:41.883 --> 01:17:45.409
Dante puts them in Hell.
Bosch paints them eating like pigs.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.817
Everybody has to eat, right?

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.472
Ah, I have a
real treasure for you.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:55.841
It's my favourite... come!

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.282
The chapel down below
was built in the 5th Century.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.449
Incredible, ah?

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:26.022
Come up here, I get something
very special for you. Please.

01:20:31.892 --> 01:20:33.492
The Susa Valley.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.788
Arthur!

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:19.671
Don't worry, he must
be inside the Abbey,

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.660
we'll find him later.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:26.324
He can't get lost...
there's only one way down.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:34.374
The Susa Valley which provided a passage
for the Longobards in the 6th Century.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.925
You're looking straight
across the mountain to France.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:41.629
Paradise.

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:50.901
Don't scream! A sudden
awakening could make him fall.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:52.694
Oh my... stay here.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:45.507
Arthur.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.723
Wake up...

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:53.010
St' Michael...

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.268
Head of the heavenly army...

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.142
Please, help this man...

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:03.521
Save this man... Spare this man...

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:07.024
Archangel of the Heavens.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:13.060
You have the power.
Please, give him the power.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.408
Give him the strength!

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:17.034
Heal him!

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.290
Please, St. Michael.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:19.225
What happened?!

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:23.450
I was flying in the void...
An angel with a birds face

01:24:23.485 --> 01:24:26.508
slow down my fall.
Was it a dream?!

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:29.026
No. You really fell.

01:24:29.439 --> 01:24:30.602
Impossible, it was real?

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.393
I go to call an ambulance.

01:24:32.428 --> 01:24:34.673
I was a child, I
was fine. My father...

01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:38.209
Did you see him?
The angel used his sword...

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.904
Don't worry, be quiet.

01:24:41.418 --> 01:24:43.729
He used his sword
to hit the dragon.

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:45.733
The dragon disappeared.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.800
On the top of the
sword it was a key...

01:24:49.624 --> 01:24:50.770
A broken key!

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:52.878
What a strange dream...

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.348
Maybe...

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:31.669
I got it!

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:38.550
It was all true.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.302
But...

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.684
Where is that man gone?

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.970
Is he your friend?
Can we trust him?

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:26.064
Those who look for the
truth are more than friends.

01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:28.058
They're brothers.

01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:31.603
Hello.

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:37.609
Good to see you.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:39.862
You are welcome.

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:42.239
Let's go to the next room.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:45.036
It's quieter, and
no one will bother us.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.990
The broken key...

01:26:50.014 --> 01:26:54.685
both an ancient symbol
of wisdom and our circle,

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:58.014
but the Ankh

01:26:58.872 --> 01:27:01.816
There are some connections
to the Egyptian Tradition

01:27:03.097 --> 01:27:04.794
of Horus and Thot...

01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:06.768
there're many,
many interpretations.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.848
Interpretations... such as?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.490
Certain things cannot be shared.

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:13.986
Always secrets.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:18.475
But of course, dear boy...
Life is full of secrets.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:22.017
And we cannot
digest them all at once.

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:25.227
It takes time and patience.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:29.769
We must reach deep and
find our own understanding.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:34.179
The broken key represents
the impossibility

01:27:34.214 --> 01:27:37.596
to discovered a secret,
even if ifs in front of our eyes,

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.252
under our nose!

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:43.517
The broken key
comes to us in many ways...

01:27:43.552 --> 01:27:45.510
Yes but, what's its meaning?

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:47.805
Explaining a symbol,

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:51.422
is like telling someone how
to feel in front of the first love

01:27:52.376 --> 01:27:53.952
or in front of a work of Art...

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:58.530
There're as many feelings...
as people in the world.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.274
Clear?

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:03.115
No...

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:06.360
Well, so much for explanations.

01:28:06.738 --> 01:28:09.131
But if you truly want
to discover the secret

01:28:09.878 --> 01:28:12.661
you have to dive
into the symbol itself

01:28:13.085 --> 01:28:16.902
by entering into your soul.
The path of the perfect man...

01:28:17.703 --> 01:28:21.816
like the Androgyny
in Bosch's painting.

01:28:22.385 --> 01:28:25.347
James, give me some
water, please... - Yeah, sure.

01:28:34.816 --> 01:28:37.911
You must embody the broken key...

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.745
become one with it...

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.633
in order to find...

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:46.608
where the Truth is concealed.

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:51.130
Symbols, secrets, metaphors...

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:53.731
They are all paths

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.525
to help us realize

01:28:57.249 --> 01:29:01.429
what would be incomprehensible.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:05.479
Then, like the Pelican
with its little ones,

01:29:06.736 --> 01:29:10.999
we will feed our children
with what we have understood.

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:14.128
Remember...

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:19.360
this city is protected by angels.

01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:27.757
And the Pelican is
the symbol of the Angels.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:33.210
<i>From Egypt, through
Saliceto, the Ankh key.</i>

01:29:33.245 --> 01:29:34.546
Queen Ankese-pa-A ton

01:29:34.581 --> 01:29:36.162
<i>and finally the Abbey of St. Michael.</i>

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:38.701
<i>Here We find the
Ankh key. But it's broken...</i>

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:42.920
Arthur!

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:44.797
Stay quiet!

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:46.514
Stay quiet!

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:47.925
There's nothing, here.

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:49.885
Where's the key?

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:53.013
Far from people like you!

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:54.773
What do you want?
Leave Sarah alone.

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.808
She has nothing to
do with it. - Tomorrow,

01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.686
at midnight,

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.038
at the fountain
of Solferino Square...

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.327
Be just a minute late, and...

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.575
I see you got it.

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:15.535
The truth...

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:19.062
is just in front of your eyes.

01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:31.552
That man in black!

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:35.726
Who? What man?

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:37.683
That man in black...
he took Sarah.

01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:40.874
Sarah? Where is she?
- We've to give him what he wants.

01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:42.817
We've to give up...
We've to him the key.

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:47.514
The forces ruling the world
are far more powerful than us all.

01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:51.186
What I know is when
the storm is coming,

01:30:51.221 --> 01:30:54.384
every man must act
according to his true nature.

01:30:54.889 --> 01:30:56.458
Some are stuck in terror,

01:30:57.203 --> 01:30:59.521
some others run
away or try to hide,

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.126
<i>some others...</i>

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:03.890
spread their
wings and start to fly...

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.509
You're right, James.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.511
War can't be eliminated

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:14.074
but just postponed to
our enemy's advantage.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:17.881
I'm calling Taron.

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:45.818
<i>The Pelican...</i>

01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:50.018
<i>feeds its sons
with its own flesh.</i>

01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:54.236
<i>The Truth...</i>

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:58.043
<i>can be seen only
through the eyes of death.</i>

01:32:59.637 --> 01:33:06.698
<i>But it must be illuminated
by the sun at its highest peak.</i>

01:33:07.618 --> 01:33:08.905
<i>The Truth</i>

01:33:10.192 --> 01:33:12.785
<i>is just in front of your eyes.</i>

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.738
21st June 2033

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:33.141
Summer Solstice - 11.59 p. m.
Midnight.

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:37.554
<i>Regulus, the diamond of the sky,</i>

01:33:37.589 --> 01:33:41.692
<i>shines with the brightest
splendor at the Summer Solstice.</i>.

01:33:42.651 --> 01:33:46.446
<i>The constellation of the Lion...
The facade of the Church...</i>

01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:47.959
<i>The path of the Worthy.</i>

01:33:47.994 --> 01:33:49.831
Special places in the city.

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:52.913
The masters of the XIX
century have shaped Turin

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:55.919
with some important monuments
linked to the symbols of magic.

01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:58.031
Like in the Book
of the Fondazione of Edfu.

01:33:58.538 --> 01:33:59.623
The Seven Sages...

01:34:00.694 --> 01:34:02.046
I must look for these places,

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:05.253
as if the entire town was
a great philosophical abode...

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:08.589
Angels, angels replace
the Egyptian gods...

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.425
Ah, here it is!

01:34:17.661 --> 01:34:18.877
I told you to come alone!

01:34:19.517 --> 01:34:20.948
What are your
friends doing over there?

01:34:23.715 --> 01:34:25.881
Now everything
will be worse for you.

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.658
No one can cover your back!

01:34:28.050 --> 01:34:31.013
Hurry up, or your friend is
going to die before sunrise!

01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:33.407
Go, go, go!

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.024
Where should I go?
- You must find Bosch's pelican!

01:34:39.905 --> 01:34:45.417
Only when you are as innocent
as a dove and as wise as a snake,

01:34:46.233 --> 01:34:48.513
can you hope to find the Truth.

01:34:49.091 --> 01:34:50.635
But the painting
is in Berlin, not here...

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.675
Where can I find
a pelican in Turin?

01:34:54.334 --> 01:34:55.478
Maybe, he mean something else...

01:34:56.566 --> 01:34:57.613
Yeah.

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:08.837
<i>This city is protected by the angels.</i>

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:11.878
I've already been to the Angelic
Fountain... Nothing! Nothing!

01:35:11.998 --> 01:35:13.375
<i>An ancient legend...</i>

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:16.783
<i>talks about an angel flying
above Europe through Turin...</i>

01:35:20.506 --> 01:35:22.368
<i>SALIGIA.
Remember this clearly:</i>

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:24.991
<i>the Latin acronym of
the seven deadly sins!</i>

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:27.942
<i>Every titan wants to
go back to his original state</i>

01:35:28.494 --> 01:35:30.807
<i>to the divine creature he once was.</i>

01:35:31.384 --> 01:35:34.870
<i>Here the Zed is
inserted in the Ankh key...</i>

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.494
<i>The Truth can't be
revealed all at once.</i>

01:35:38.533 --> 01:35:41.776
<i>Someone is using Art
to spread his wisdom...</i>

01:35:42.592 --> 01:35:47.473
<i>and Art is like a breath
of wind bringing change.</i>

01:35:49.153 --> 01:35:51.874
Statuto Square! Yes!
I must reach Statuto Square.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.193
There is another angel, over there!

01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:58.850
A dove and a snake, together.

01:36:02.131 --> 01:36:05.948
Dove and snake, together.
The angel of the metamorphosis:

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.867
the snake becoming
a dove and flying away.

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.775
It's Lucifer, the Angel
bearer of the light... the star.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.563
The Angel with his feet on
the rocks and his head in the sky...

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:19.636
Yes!

01:36:20.066 --> 01:36:22.417
Damn it, I can't
find the pelican here!

01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:27.586
No, it's not the pelican!

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.968
What is he looking at?

01:36:34.913 --> 01:36:36.457
Yes, the Great Mother.

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:45.939
On the right, a man is
holding the Tables of the Law,

01:36:46.563 --> 01:36:50.252
on the left there is Charity,
with an angel looking at the chalice,

01:36:50.287 --> 01:36:54.873
the Sacred Grail,
the Christ, the Pelican...

01:36:54.908 --> 01:36:57.530
who feeds his
sons with his own flesh.

01:37:22.253 --> 01:37:23.846
No!

01:37:32.263 --> 01:37:33.765
It's impossible! Nicholas...

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:37.171
<i>Another angel is flying away...</i>

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.412
Sarah, where are you?

01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:52.613
<i>Some are stuck in terror,</i>

01:37:53.309 --> 01:37:55.718
<i>some others run
away or try to hide,</i>

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.556
<i>some others spread
their Wings and start to fly.</i>

01:38:09.341 --> 01:38:10.254
Sarah!

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:57.374
Father!

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:06.257
I am Yesterday,
Today and Tomorrow...

01:40:07.043 --> 01:40:12.259
I have the Power
to give life back.

01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:16.482
Father, I understand... finally.

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:18.947
What's happening?

01:40:22.676 --> 01:40:25.805
The the flying angel is
the Angel of the Tower.

01:40:26.358 --> 01:40:29.702
There was once an angel
of the tower... on top of it.

01:40:30.485 --> 01:40:33.586
He fell because of a storm...

01:40:35.905 --> 01:40:40.117
The angelic fountain,
Lucifer, the Grail, the Pelican,

01:40:40.451 --> 01:40:43.462
the Angel looking at the Grail
held by a dreaming woman.

01:40:43.951 --> 01:40:47.462
No... No, she's looking at
the Angel on the Tower!

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.902
I'm Lucifer,

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:53.244
I am Osiris and Horus

01:40:53.839 --> 01:40:55.501
searching for the Light.

01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:56.927
I can't believe it!

01:40:57.582 --> 01:40:58.920
It's like the old cathedrals.

01:41:00.776 --> 01:41:03.802
This city is a great
open-sky sanctuary!

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.467
The Antonelliana Tower,
it's a portal to the Light!

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:08.967
It's like the Sphinx
in the Plain of Giza!

01:41:09.317 --> 01:41:11.730
The Angel!
The Angel was over there!

01:41:20.459 --> 01:41:24.314
Beautifull, finally...

01:41:26.059 --> 01:41:29.044
the way to Paradise.

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:31.341
Let's go.

01:42:27.933 --> 01:42:31.337
It's a star. It
stands for knowledge.

01:42:35.059 --> 01:42:37.897
Once, there was a
winged genius, up there...

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.417
an angel of fire.

01:42:43.627 --> 01:42:45.244
He was a protector of secrets.

01:42:46.644 --> 01:42:49.157
Those secrets that
could not be revealed.

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:03.286
It has been hidden
at the base of the genius.

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:06.583
They didn't want it to be found.

01:43:06.972 --> 01:43:08.271
Because if revealed,

01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:11.688
that knowledge ill use... could...

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:17.488
it could crush the world...
the world as we know it.

01:43:17.566 --> 01:43:19.756
But should the
Knowledge belong to everybody.

01:43:22.877 --> 01:43:24.222
Some people don't think so.

01:43:25.116 --> 01:43:28.581
They had the angel
struck down by thunder.

01:43:29.789 --> 01:43:31.366
So the secret was concealed...

01:43:32.727 --> 01:43:34.062
I don't understand.

01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:39.293
Two different forces
are working together.

01:43:40.124 --> 01:43:41.708
They have concealed the secret...

01:43:44.333 --> 01:43:47.061
in the tower, once more.

01:43:47.682 --> 01:43:49.131
The star of Knowledge.

01:43:50.766 --> 01:43:52.307
The highest point in town.

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:56.220
It's still there!

01:43:58.677 --> 01:44:00.149
It's still there...

01:44:02.533 --> 01:44:04.277
waiting for someone to find it...

01:44:04.613 --> 01:44:06.350
and to decide...

01:44:07.559 --> 01:44:09.856
if to keep it or to
show it to the world...

01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.608
Hey!

01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:14.490
Don't do it!

01:44:15.624 --> 01:44:17.081
No! Don't do it!

01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:30.584
You, bastard!

01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:36.153
Why?

01:44:53.204 --> 01:44:54.672
Are you Ok?

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.172
Are you feeling all right?

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:57.786
Are you hurt?

01:44:58.167 --> 01:45:00.362
It's ok. I've just
slipped. Thank you.

01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:03.178
Lucy.

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:05.858
Let's go.

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:08.149
It's time.

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:12.077
I've to go.

01:46:02.982 --> 01:46:04.785
Do you know
how to use the key?

01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:06.802
What does it open?

01:46:07.787 --> 01:46:10.020
If you don't know what to
do, just leave the key here.

01:46:11.012 --> 01:46:13.437
Someone more deserving
than you will continue the quest.

01:46:17.413 --> 01:46:21.191
You must to learn
to ask the right questions.

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:26.518
Only then, you will
really receive an answer.

01:46:28.792 --> 01:46:31.711
Must the key be reconstituted
or should it be left broken?

01:46:38.404 --> 01:46:41.023
Is man ready
to reconstitute it?

01:46:41.911 --> 01:46:44.398
This... this is the right question.

01:46:47.124 --> 01:46:48.420
A whole key could...

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:50.757
reveal some...

01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:53.982
ill-timed surprises!

01:46:55.134 --> 01:46:58.583
If man is not ready...
- Who is the guardian?

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:03.963
You are the guardian.

01:47:06.712 --> 01:47:08.305
Your heart is pure now.

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:11.994
We're here.

01:47:14.428 --> 01:47:15.523
You may pass.

01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:16.623
Arthur!

01:48:19.243 --> 01:48:20.665
Let's go.

01:49:02.286 --> 01:49:05.000
Give me the key.
It's my turn to go ahead.

01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:07.091
No, we must go all together.

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:10.131
I told you to give me the key.

01:49:10.586 --> 01:49:14.003
Taron, what are you
doing? - Shut up, old man!

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.301
The key!

01:49:18.302 --> 01:49:19.349
The key!

01:49:21.722 --> 01:49:22.848
The key!

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:27.836
Bastard, now I understand!

01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:31.109
War can't be eliminated,

01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:35.037
but just postponed to
our enemy's advantage.

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:37.363
Houzzai!

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:39.118
Houzzai!

01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.992
Houzzai!

01:50:13.652 --> 01:50:14.979
James, are you Ok?

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.980
Don't worry about me.

01:50:18.904 --> 01:50:21.413
Go on, I will join you later.

01:50:21.657 --> 01:50:25.831
We must go on, it's vital!
- Go, what are you waiting for?

01:50:26.662 --> 01:50:28.915
I am fine... don't worry.
- Ok, come on, let's go.

01:51:07.536 --> 01:51:08.958
No!

01:51:19.464 --> 01:51:23.072
You can't win,
you have to give up.

01:51:25.179 --> 01:51:26.633
Maybe...

01:51:27.233 --> 01:51:29.426
you'll have some hope.

01:51:31.476 --> 01:51:33.065
Then?

01:51:42.863 --> 01:51:44.346
Only if you give up.

01:51:44.615 --> 01:51:47.324
can still have hope.

01:51:54.395 --> 01:51:57.888
You are not real.
You can't hurt me.

01:52:41.325 --> 01:52:43.040
Arthur!

01:52:45.133 --> 01:52:46.305
Sarah.

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:15.706
Are you Ok?

01:53:16.957 --> 01:53:19.835
Yes, it's fine! - Could
you give me the light?

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:22.088
Sure, here you are.

01:54:47.798 --> 01:54:49.788
The Gate of the Duat.

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.047
The Gate of Heaven
for the pure of heart.
