WEBVTT

00:30.864 --> 00:32.466
Sorry you're
feeling sick, bro.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.801
Hopefully, this
soup will help.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.404
This should keep
you nice and warm.

00:36.437 --> 00:41.209
And I have prepared
the ceremonial sword for
your end-of-life ritual.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.612
-Please extend your neck.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.247
It's just a cold, Star!

00:46.280 --> 00:48.082
I'll be better in a few days.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.351
ROBIN: This is
no cold, Cyborg!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.386
I've seen this before.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.789
A virus has invaded your body!
And it's destroying
you from the inside out.

00:55.823 --> 00:59.127
You are dying!

00:59.160 --> 01:00.628
This is awesome!

01:00.661 --> 01:03.497
-Body Adventure!

01:03.531 --> 01:04.732
That's why.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.701
It's every superhero's dream
to shrink down to the size of

01:07.735 --> 01:10.704
a germ and to explore
the miracle of the body.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.772
That ain't my dream.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.375
-Yeah, gross!
-Think about it.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.445
ROBIN: Surfing on blood cells,
climbing a rib cage,

01:17.478 --> 01:22.416
swimming in the stomach,
I'll take down those
viruses, mano-a-germo!

01:22.450 --> 01:25.586
Hyah! You know...

01:25.619 --> 01:27.321
Body Adventure!

01:27.355 --> 01:29.657
Sorry, you aren't
crawling all up in this.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.558
It's just a cold!

01:30.591 --> 01:33.794
And it's going to kill you,
Cyborg! Maybe!

01:33.827 --> 01:35.863
Panic!

01:35.896 --> 01:38.699
You can't go
inside him, Robin.
It's not like we have a...

01:38.732 --> 01:40.901
"Brand new shrink
ray I just bought"?

01:43.404 --> 01:44.772
Uh, dude, are
you sure it's new?

01:44.805 --> 01:47.608
Yeah, they don't sell junk
at the swap meet.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.377
Now, stand aside!

01:53.614 --> 01:57.785
Body Adventure!
Body Adventure!
Body Adventure!

01:57.818 --> 02:01.622
Robin, are you not supposed
to be much smaller?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.757
I think that's
as far as it goes.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.359
Huh, no problem.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.661
This can still work.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.235
Cyborg, open wide!

02:14.268 --> 02:15.703
-ROBIN: Body Adventure!

02:15.736 --> 02:18.572
-Do not worry, Cyborg,

02:18.606 --> 02:20.774
I shall maneuver
your Heimlich.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.220
Oh, no, is the ray of
shrinking broken?

02:32.253 --> 02:33.854
Looks like it.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.823
Then Robin's stuck as a baby?

02:35.856 --> 02:38.559
Oh, it's okay, my baby-waby.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.694
Our li'l coco-moco-chucka...
Ow!

02:40.728 --> 02:42.663
Bad baby! Bad!

02:42.696 --> 02:44.832
Okay, Titans, change of plans!

02:44.865 --> 02:46.800
Body Adventure is canceled,

02:46.834 --> 02:50.371
but Operation
Big World is a go!

02:50.404 --> 02:52.940
Whoo-hoo! Everything's huge!

02:52.973 --> 02:55.776
This is awesome!

02:55.809 --> 02:58.546
I am so hungry,
one pizza won't be enough!

02:58.579 --> 03:03.751
And while you starve, I'll
live for an entire week on
this single topping.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.654
How am I going
to finish this all?

03:07.955 --> 03:10.524
The food just keeps coming.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.394
I am stuffed.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.605
-Whoo-hoo! Silky Horse!

03:35.349 --> 03:36.884
Robin!

03:36.917 --> 03:39.687
Oh, I did not see you enter.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.821
Exactly!

03:40.854 --> 03:43.391
Being tiny really increases my
ninja stealth skills.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.393
What's that behind your ear?

03:45.426 --> 03:48.662
It's me!
I can be anywhere at any time
and you would never know.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.931
Anyway, just pretend
I'm not here.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.679
-Can't seem
to shake this cold.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.618
I stepped on tiny Robin!

04:10.651 --> 04:12.886
No, you stepped
on my cherry tomato!

04:12.920 --> 04:15.055
Now what am I going to
use as a bowling ball?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.757
Dude, we need to talk!

04:20.861 --> 04:23.364
Sounds like your cold
is getting worse.

04:23.397 --> 04:27.901
Just say the word
and I'll write you
a prescription for a...

04:27.935 --> 04:30.003
Body Adventure.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.505
Stop with the Body Adventure!

04:31.539 --> 04:33.341
My body is not
an adventure to be had!

04:33.374 --> 04:36.510
-We think you should unshrink
yourself, Robin.
-Indeed,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.879
I feel like I am being
watched wherever I go.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.014
And I'm just not ready to
be a father yet.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.616
No way!

04:42.650 --> 04:44.852
Being tiny is awesome!

04:44.885 --> 04:47.054
Check this out.

04:47.087 --> 04:51.492
I made a mountain
out of flour and these
carrot sticks are my skis.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.861
Whoo-hoo!

04:53.894 --> 04:58.566
And, if you think that's cool,
check out my new boomerang.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.434
I made it out of a toenail.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.670
-ALL: UGH!

05:03.937 --> 05:05.105
That's it!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.608
If you're going to stay small,
you cannot be our leader!

05:07.641 --> 05:10.678
-We're big people dealing with
big problems.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.481
We need you up here.
Now what do you say?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.918
Never! I love my tiny life!

05:22.155 --> 05:24.091
Silky Horse!

05:33.667 --> 05:34.968
What are you doing?

05:35.002 --> 05:38.005
I've decided to shrink the
entire team.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.541
-But the ray is broken.
-Not anymore.

05:40.574 --> 05:44.712
I was able to fix and improve
it with my tiny hands.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.448
Let's do it! Tiny Titans, go!

05:47.481 --> 05:51.419
Now enough of this
shrinking nonsense!

05:51.452 --> 05:53.421
It's time to...

06:00.027 --> 06:02.029
What happened to my body?

06:02.062 --> 06:05.065
The virus has
gotten so bad that it's shut
down all your systems.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.668
Exactly like I told
you it would.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.136
We're going to need more soup.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.672
Or, you know, real medicine.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.607
No, it's already too late.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.843
We only have one option.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.611
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

06:17.645 --> 06:19.880
Body Adventure!

06:30.591 --> 06:31.792
Where are we?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.794
Looks like we're
lost in the carpet.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.162
Not for long.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.498
Let's climb something tall to
get our bearings.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.170
Ooh, that looks kinda far.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.739
Perhaps we should have gotten
closer to my body first.

07:05.526 --> 07:09.663
Oh, hey, it's Jerry,
my favorite flea.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.965
Flea you later, Jerry.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.068
STARFIRE: We have not moved
but a few inches closer.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.907
We're never going to make it.
I'm going to die here,
sick, tiny and alone.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.076
Not on my tiny watch.
I have an ace up my sleeve.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.155
Silky Horse!

07:47.835 --> 07:51.238
We finally made it!
Body Adventure!

07:51.271 --> 07:52.506
Ah!

07:52.540 --> 07:53.541
BEAST BOY: Oh!

07:55.543 --> 07:57.277
Wow!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.846
Where are we?

07:58.879 --> 08:01.048
Ugh, I think it's the stomach.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.518
Whoa, this is most unpleasant.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.820
Come on, this is great.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.156
Who wants to surf
this hot dog?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.726
Easy! Ugh!

08:12.760 --> 08:15.729
This is... This is fun...

08:17.030 --> 08:19.232
Like a big old swimming pool.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.869
Body Adventure.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.270
Yuck.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.839
Oh, well...
Aah, that tastes gross!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.242
There's more fun
to be had in the body.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.178
Follow me!

08:40.187 --> 08:43.557
-Body Adventure!

08:44.625 --> 08:46.226
Hmm... Where to next?

08:46.259 --> 08:49.597
I know, let's hit the rib cage
for some awesome climbing.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.833
Would not the virus most
likely inhabit his air sacks?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.568
Yeah, probably.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.905
Fine!

08:57.938 --> 09:00.273
BEAST BOY: Ugh! It's so slimy!

09:00.307 --> 09:03.043
Ugh, it's like you were
inhaling jelly, Cyborg.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.914
So fun!

09:06.947 --> 09:08.281
Mucus vines!

09:08.315 --> 09:11.585
Don't do that!
It tickles.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.094
Oh, gross!

09:21.128 --> 09:24.898
I need a shower!

09:24.932 --> 09:28.001
Okay, Robin, maybe we should
just take Cyborg to a doctor.

09:28.035 --> 09:32.205
No, we came in here to fight
some viruses in
an awesome showdown

09:32.239 --> 09:34.307
and that's what we're
going to do.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.611
-Look, there's one now!

09:39.713 --> 09:41.181
Titans, go!

09:41.214 --> 09:43.116
-I would rather the not.
-I am not touching that thing.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.686
-Gross, dude!
-Uh, no thanks.

09:55.996 --> 10:00.701
Everything in this body is
sticky and smelly and weird.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.137
I thought a Body
Adventure would be
awesome but it's just gross!

10:04.171 --> 10:07.240
Come on, let's
get out of here.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.077
I'll just be over here,
inflaming some membranes

10:10.110 --> 10:13.346
and spreading
mucus and what have you.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.054
How do we save
poor Cyborg now?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.255
-STARFIRE: Oh.
-RAVEN: Ugh.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.992
Maybe try calling a doctor!

10:25.025 --> 10:27.695
-Fine!
-Azarath Metrion Zinthos.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.268
-WOMAN: 911,
what's your emergency?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.337
-RAVEN: You got to help us.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.306
What?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.241
-Sorry, I can't
understand you.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.677
Is this some kind of joke?

10:43.711 --> 10:45.378
RAVEN: No, no, no, no, no,
don't hang up!
