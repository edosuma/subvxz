gotten easier by now.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.617
I think we've somehow defied
the laws of physiology

11:40.700 --> 11:43.078
- and gotten worse.
- I know.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.996
I feel like I'm letting down
my new running outfit.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.165
Oh, no. You look amazing.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.043
Ah, the speed walkers
are passing us again.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.461
Oh, man.

11:51.545 --> 11:55.298
Hi, Crystal. Hey, Pearl.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.093
Ah, in their defense,
we're doing a lot more talking

11:58.176 --> 11:59.886
- than we are running.
- At this rate,

11:59.970 --> 12:02.681
we'd probably burn more calories
chewing food.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.183
Oh, like a big, doughy
croissant.

12:05.267 --> 12:09.438
I bet I could burn 50 cals
just in jaw action alone.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.398
Should we put that theory
to the test?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.109
Sure. You got a croissant
on you?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.361
Eh, do you trust me?

12:16.445 --> 12:17.904

[knock on door]

12:23.034 --> 12:25.036
Hi. Huh.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.705
Somehow you've decided
on clothes

12:26.788 --> 12:28.165
even less appropriate
for hiking

12:28.248 --> 12:31.460
than a crop top
and combat boots. Imagine that.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.879
Yeah, so I know that
I agreed to the hike

12:33.962 --> 12:37.007
- and the dinner and the drinks.
- Yes, you did agree

12:37.090 --> 12:38.758
- to those things.
- Okay.

12:38.842 --> 12:44.055
But I was thinking, what if
we went to wine country instead?

12:44.139 --> 12:46.850
Wait. Really?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.935
Yeah. Yeah.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.647
Me and you and wine
and rolling hills

No, I mean, I-I just thought
that it would be fun

13:06.745 --> 13:08.246
to get out of the city.

Wow.

Valentine's Day

of my boyfriend? Mmm.

- Yes, you do.

- Mmm.
- [laughs]

Uh, let me, uh, change
really quick into something

13:26.723 --> 13:28.350
a little more appropriate.

- Yeah.

I won't care,

is making me hungry.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.005
Which is the worst thing
to be at a winery

20:14.088 --> 20:16.716
because all they have here is
finger foods and cornichons,

20:16.799 --> 20:19.385
- when all I really want
is a burger.
- Mmm.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.721
Right? I swear,
the best meal in Portland

20:21.804 --> 20:23.932
after a night out is
Burgerville on MLK.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.516
I mean, to hell with
all these foodie restaurants

20:25.600 --> 20:28.019
and their truffle cheese
and Impossible meat.

20:28.102 --> 20:31.564
They had grass-fed before it was
cool to do grass-fed.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.902
What, do I have tannins
in my teeth or something?

20:35.985 --> 20:40.198

obsessed with Burgerville

20:42.200 --> 20:43.493
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.245
I'm just saying,
two hamburgers and waffle fries?

20:46.329 --> 20:47.956
Sorry, sorry, I think you mean
two hamburgers

20:48.039 --> 20:49.582
and shoestring fries.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.459
I-I got to disagree.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.794
So, Lily, not to pry,

20:52.877 --> 20:55.922
but what's someone as
charming and lovely as you

20:56.005 --> 20:58.007
doing up here alone
on Valentine's Day?

20:58.091 --> 21:01.469
I had plans to
come up here with my ex,

21:01.552 --> 21:03.137
- but we broke up.
- Oh.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.765
And I tried to cancel
the hotel reservations,

21:05.848 --> 21:07.684
but there was a huge fee,
so I thought,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.144
"You know what,
let's do this solo."

21:10.228 --> 21:11.396
- Mm-hmm.
- Why'd you break up?

21:11.479 --> 21:13.815
Dude, you can't just ask that.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.566
Oh, please.
You wanted to know.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.026
Yeah, but I would've
done it better.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.112
It's-it's all good, um...

21:19.195 --> 21:24.534
but after three years
it just never felt...

- Mm.

- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.457
Oh, you-you weren't joking.

21:31.541 --> 21:35.420
No. Why would I be joking?

21:36.462 --> 21:37.547
I just thought the girl

21:37.630 --> 21:39.090
who thinks Valentine's Day
is criminal

21:39.173 --> 21:41.009
wouldn't possibly think
love is magical.

was criminal, not the day.

it's all bullshit.

No, it's definitely, um,
not Lil. Why would Lil be here?
