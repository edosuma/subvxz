E.R.

00:06.939 --> 00:08.243
Previously on ER...

00:08.578 --> 00:09.806
Get the gurney, Conni!

00:09.886 --> 00:12.063
She has bruising around her groin.
She may have been raped.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.570
I'd be lucky to find someone like you.

00:14.849 --> 00:18.008
- You neglected your duties.
- You feel that way, speak to me.

00:18.154 --> 00:20.649
You feel Dr. Benton's reaction
was inappropriate?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.564
I wouldn't call it inappropriate.

00:22.809 --> 00:24.660
Administration's making me
fire two nurses.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.025
I didn't think you'd go to Anspaugh.

00:27.329 --> 00:28.812
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.428
Man versus El train.

00:30.669 --> 00:31.669
Suicide?

00:32.186 --> 00:33.256
- Dennis?
- It's Gant!

00:33.603 --> 00:34.477
Oh, sweet Jesus!

00:34.851 --> 00:36.292
- Carter, put the tube in!
- Oh, God!

01:30.890 --> 01:34.474
What happened?
I guess that's the question.

01:34.937 --> 01:39.398
How could this awful,
senseless thing happen?

01:41.486 --> 01:46.195
I've seen traumas from plenty of
accidents since I started my training.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.695
But this was someone I knew.

01:48.953 --> 01:51.658
- But you' re convinced it was an accident?
- I guess.

01:51.873 --> 01:53.153
Have the police...?

01:53.374 --> 01:55.747
I don't think they've come
to any conclusions.

01:57.296 --> 02:00.914
Either he lost his balance
and fell under the tracks...

02:01.258 --> 02:02.635
...or he jumped.

02:04.763 --> 02:09.389
I understand that you and Dr. Gant
were friends? Roommates?

02:11.396 --> 02:14.432
Well, we hadn't seen much
of each other for the last...

02:15.024 --> 02:16.769
...month.

02:19.613 --> 02:22.022
I was seeing somebody,
and I was staying...

02:22.242 --> 02:24.282
...over at her place a lot.

02:25.829 --> 02:30.291
Obviously, the hospital is interested
in finding out if anything...

02:30.501 --> 02:33.456
...could have been done
to prevent this tragedy.

02:33.630 --> 02:35.172
You mean if it were a suicide?

02:36.300 --> 02:40.168
We're both aware of the complaint
about Dr. Benton Dennis lodged...

02:40.388 --> 02:42.179
...on the day of his death.

02:44.142 --> 02:45.802
In your judgment...

02:46.144 --> 02:50.689
...was this day unique
in Dr. Gant's experience...

02:51.401 --> 02:54.651
...or had he frequently felt
he was treated unfairly?

02:54.863 --> 02:55.895
We both complained.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.780
About the hours, the Residents...

03:07.002 --> 03:11.961
...if anyone or anything
put undue pressure on Dr. Gant.

03:12.133 --> 03:15.467
A policy, a teaching method,
anything...

03:15.679 --> 03:18.764
...that seems, in retrospect,
too harsh.

03:19.141 --> 03:21.383
I'll have to think about that.

03:23.105 --> 03:25.892
Dr. Gant's father is arriving
this afternoon...

03:27.234 --> 03:31.447
...to collect his things
and bring the body back home to...

03:31.656 --> 03:33.032
Atlanta.

03:33.325 --> 03:37.074
I hope you'll be able to accompany
Mr. Gant to the apartment.

03:46.465 --> 03:48.956
Oh, my God, John.
I couldn't believe it.

03:49.802 --> 03:51.630
What a shocker.
Think he pulled a Cobain?

03:51.805 --> 03:52.919
Dale.

03:53.098 --> 03:57.346
Well, if they do rule it a suicide,
maybe we'll get some shorter hours.

04:01.232 --> 04:04.151
Dennis said something at Christmas
about his girlfriend...

04:04.320 --> 04:06.893
...but if he were depressed,
you would've noticed, right?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.443
Yeah, I would've.

04:08.657 --> 04:09.772
It's the ER.

04:09.992 --> 04:13.196
- I thought you had the ER yesterday.
- I'm covering Dennis' shift.

04:16.791 --> 04:19.200
- I need 8 units of O-neg.
- What's up?

04:19.379 --> 04:23.211
- Two GSWs coming in. Both critical.
- All sharps and meds are accounted for.

04:23.383 --> 04:25.922
Get ready for the next guest.
Set up the rapid infuser.

04:26.136 --> 04:28.888
- Benton coming down?
- I don't know. Haven't seen him yet.

04:29.098 --> 04:32.219
I was sorry to hear about Dennis.
Got any more news?

04:32.394 --> 04:33.769
Not yet.

04:34.104 --> 04:37.937
We'll take the chest wound in 2, we'll
handle the extremity wound right here.

04:38.151 --> 04:39.182
Got it.

04:41.654 --> 04:43.943
Respiratory's alerted.
I'll set up a vent.

04:44.157 --> 04:46.032
I'll spike you up
a couple liters of saline.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.862
Here's a fresh chest-tube tray.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.198
- Who's with us, Carol?
- I paged Lily. She'll join you.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.581
Conni will scribe.
Me and Malik are with Carter.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.958
- All right. What do we got?
- Two GSWs.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.001
- You and Carter take the chest wound.
- Room prepped?

04:59.342 --> 05:01.133
O- neg's here.
Both rooms are ready.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.423
Chest-tube tray's set.

05:02.595 --> 05:05.597
- Call Radiology. Get a portable.
- We did it.

05:05.808 --> 05:08.477
- Battery on the laryngoscope checked?
- Done.

05:08.686 --> 05:11.058
- Looks like we're ready to go.
- Where are they?

05:11.272 --> 05:12.767
I'll check the ET A.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.687
Did you get my message
about the memorial service?

05:17.863 --> 05:18.979
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

05:19.157 --> 05:21.446
I was wondering if you
would or could say a few words.

05:21.618 --> 05:23.492
Are you talking about the memorial?

05:23.662 --> 05:26.580
- It's 5:00 in the chapel, right?
- I still can't believe it.

05:26.749 --> 05:28.374
Me neither.

05:29.911 --> 05:31.491
Here comes the groom.

05:31.671 --> 05:34.044
- Zadro's got the bride.
- Let's put her in 1.

05:34.258 --> 05:35.835
GSW to the chest.

05:36.051 --> 05:37.332
Intubated in the field.

05:37.553 --> 05:41.172
Two liters in. BP, 40 palp.
Sinus tach at 150.

05:41.391 --> 05:44.807
Two GSWs, left lower extremity.
No distal pulse.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.268
- A third gurney?
- Best man. Wound to the abdomen.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.432
He's stable. BP's 120/80. Pulse, 88.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.403
We only knew about two victims.
Hold him right here.

05:52.613 --> 05:53.644
Carter!

05:55.616 --> 05:58.321
One, two, three.

05:59.204 --> 06:02.039
- Evaluate the guy in the hall.
- Notify Vascular.

06:02.290 --> 06:03.832
I need to steal Malik.

06:04.042 --> 06:08.123
Be my guest. H & H.
Type and cross for six. Portable chest.

06:08.297 --> 06:12.591
Set up a transfuser.
Large-bore IV with blood tubing.

06:12.761 --> 06:14.884
Let's run it wide open. Let's go.

06:15.055 --> 06:17.013
- Carter, come on.
- Coming.

07:10.703 --> 07:12.862
We got to the "Do you take? " part...

07:13.081 --> 07:15.787
...and bam!
There's Bouey, her ex, blasting away.

07:16.001 --> 07:17.828
- Hey, Lily?
- More blood for the bride!

07:18.045 --> 07:20.501
Any exam rooms open
for our best man here?

07:20.716 --> 07:22.459
- Not yet.
- How are Duke and Katria?

07:22.676 --> 07:25.677
- I'm taking you for an abdominal CT.
- Pressure's dropping!

07:25.846 --> 07:27.424
- He's crashing!
- Damn it! Take that!

07:27.640 --> 07:29.218
Two units O-neg onboard.

07:29.434 --> 07:31.427
My guy bottomed out.
I need to do a central line.

07:31.603 --> 07:32.634
Want me to hold your hand?

07:32.812 --> 07:34.438
- There's no room!
- Figure it out.

07:34.649 --> 07:36.772
- Where's the type-specific blood?
- It's coming.

07:36.984 --> 07:38.182
Start pushing, Malik!

07:38.361 --> 07:39.985
- Where we going?
- Trauma 2.

07:42.950 --> 07:45.488
- Scoot over! Make room!
- To the right! To the right!

07:45.702 --> 07:49.488
Get a central-line kit, an intubation tray,
and start pushing the O-neg.

07:49.708 --> 07:51.416
- How's that pressure?
-40 palp.

07:51.626 --> 07:54.461
Okay. Let's get a central-line kit
here now.

07:54.629 --> 07:55.661
Trendelenburg.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.998
- Whose monitor is that?
- Ours. He's arrested.

07:58.217 --> 08:00.887
All right. Thoracotomy tray!
Let's move! Come on!

08:01.597 --> 08:03.506
- You want to watch your elbows?
- Let's go.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.677
I missed you last night.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.558
- How's your cold?
- It's better.

08:08.813 --> 08:10.605
- Thanks for the roses.
- You like them?

08:10.815 --> 08:13.307
- I love them.
- Here.

08:13.568 --> 08:16.487
Man, you are spoiling me,
you know that?

08:17.073 --> 08:19.990
- Something wrong?
- Oh, you know. All this union stuff.

08:20.201 --> 08:22.076
It's gonna be a weird day
for the nurses.

08:22.287 --> 08:25.158
- So is this sickout gonna happen?
- Yeah, I think so.

08:25.749 --> 08:28.075
- Does it bother you that I told you?
- Of course not.

08:28.252 --> 08:30.292
We're still on for tonight?
Movie, dinner?

08:31.756 --> 08:32.788
It's a date.

08:36.345 --> 08:38.671
It's fractured.
How's that pressure dressing?

08:38.847 --> 08:41.765
- Looks like we stopped the bleeding.
- Four units of A-positive.

08:41.976 --> 08:44.303
- Next door.
- Let's get that arteriogram.

08:45.189 --> 08:46.980
Finally.
Type-specific's here.

08:47.149 --> 08:48.977
It's a little late now. Statinsky.

08:49.152 --> 08:51.560
- I'm in. Keep the O-neg going.
- Pressure's coming up.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.986
My guy's stable.
You need some help?

08:54.199 --> 08:56.157
Goddamn it!
There's nothing to clamp.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.358
He's bled out.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.366
Flatline.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.458
All right. Time of death, 12:05.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.336
BP's stable, 100/60.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.461
- Wanna take this guy up?
- Yeah, let's go.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.132
All right. Let's go.

09:10.886 --> 09:13.211
- You do the body, I'll do the room?
- Sure.

09:14.222 --> 09:16.263
I'm a little short-handed
this afternoon.

09:16.476 --> 09:18.599
A lot of my nurses are
calling in sick.

09:18.811 --> 09:20.934
Is there any way you could
pull a double?

09:21.147 --> 09:22.178
Sorry.

09:22.983 --> 09:25.023
Carol, can you give us a hand in here?

09:25.236 --> 09:26.896
Go on. I'll get this.

09:34.663 --> 09:38.828
The memorial service is gonna be
in the hospital chapel.

09:41.254 --> 09:42.962
You wouldn't need to say much.
Just-

09:43.173 --> 09:45.499
Forget it. I'm no public speaker.

09:51.975 --> 09:54.976
There's still no official ruling
on the cause of death.

09:55.145 --> 09:58.100
Dr. Anspaugh says the police
are still talking to witnesses.

09:58.274 --> 10:00.682
- Maybe they'll turn up something.
- When did you speak to Anspaugh?

10:00.860 --> 10:03.102
This morning. He called in the interns.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.606
- Why?
- Why? To see how we're doing.

10:05.825 --> 10:10.571
- To see what we think happened.
- Were there any interns on the platform?

10:10.789 --> 10:15.167
I think he was wondering about Gant's
state of mind these last couple weeks.

10:15.377 --> 10:18.249
Did he call you guys in
one at a time or all together?

10:18.465 --> 10:20.956
One at a time.
Hasn't Anspaugh talked to you yet?

10:21.176 --> 10:24.795
I'm supposed to go talk to him.
I guess he needs to do a survey first.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.298
- GSW to the abdomen. Who's on call?
- Dr. Hicks.

10:27.683 --> 10:30.221
I don't think anybody's blaming you.

10:30.436 --> 10:33.687
Why would they? Did you finish
your rounds this morning?

10:34.149 --> 10:37.150
- Not yet.
- Get to it. I can finish this myself.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.942
INTERN EVALUATION FORM
DENNIS GANT

11:15.990 --> 11:20.320
She'll stay on a 72-hour hold while
we finish her psychiatric evaluation.

11:20.537 --> 11:23.953
- Steer clear. You're too entangled.
- I'm her doctor.

11:24.124 --> 11:26.996
And her guardian angel,
and the guy who let her down.

11:27.211 --> 11:29.785
- Is she pissed?
- At you? Yeah, sure.

11:30.006 --> 11:33.341
You told her you wouldn't sell her
into the system, and you did.

11:33.594 --> 11:35.836
But betrayal isn't
anything new to her.

11:36.055 --> 11:38.131
She's a 14-year-old on the streets.

11:38.307 --> 11:41.724
You don't have to explain it to me.
Or to her.

11:42.145 --> 11:45.349
Another doc could follow up
on her neuro exam.

11:45.650 --> 11:47.275
You knew I'd be back.

11:47.443 --> 11:51.109
She's a kid you helped, who hates
your guts. You want to change that.

11:51.281 --> 11:52.657
What's Charlie's prognosis?

11:52.825 --> 11:55.660
She's got issues, but I won't
recommend a psychiatric placement.

11:55.828 --> 11:57.406
DCFS will take over from here.

11:57.580 --> 11:59.657
But it wouldn't be a problem
for her if I see her?

11:59.833 --> 12:02.585
Charlie's armor is in good shape.
How's yours?

12:08.468 --> 12:12.086
- What are you doing this afternoon?
- Lydia and I are hitting the January sales.

12:12.263 --> 12:15.100
I'm not spending a penny
until our contract is settled.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.387
It'll settle. Nothing like
a case of the pink flu to make a point.

12:18.604 --> 12:21.227
- I've never been on a strike.
- I hope you never will be.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.933
This is just a sickout.
The pink flu.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.437
- Close your ears, E-Ray.
- I'm a union man.

12:26.656 --> 12:30.606
One shift without RNs will make them
think twice about cutting overtime.

12:30.785 --> 12:33.074
- I'm worried about the patients.
- We all are.

12:33.289 --> 12:36.954
That's why we won't accept a contract
that compromises patient care.

12:37.168 --> 12:39.077
- Or screws us.
- That too.

12:39.545 --> 12:42.120
Could you help me
with this damn coffeemaker?

12:42.299 --> 12:44.707
See? What would they do
without us RNs?

12:44.927 --> 12:47.597
You should be taking tea
and lemon for that cold.

12:47.973 --> 12:50.464
Oh, boy. I hate to see her fall.

12:50.642 --> 12:51.757
I tried to warn her.

12:51.977 --> 12:54.136
Oh, Dr. Greene's a nice guy.

12:54.313 --> 12:56.353
Dr. Greene's a doctor, on the rebound.

12:56.524 --> 12:58.517
How many nurse/doctor flings
have you known?

12:58.693 --> 12:59.772
Including my own?

12:59.944 --> 13:01.653
And how many of them worked out?

13:01.822 --> 13:05.736
The problem is, she's got a grand trine
in fire, and his sun is in Pisces.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.194
Labs are back from Curtain 3.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.861
They're mine.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.740
Haleh, can you pull a double?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.041
- When?
- Today.

13:15.213 --> 13:18.831
- My entire p. m. shift called in sick.
- I heard something was going around.

13:19.050 --> 13:21.174
Something's going around.
Can you stay?

13:21.387 --> 13:24.886
I'm sorry.
I'm coming down with it myself.

13:31.523 --> 13:33.266
Hey, Charlie.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.316
I just want to check
on your concussion.

13:37.614 --> 13:39.405
It's only gonna take a second.

13:39.991 --> 13:41.320
Come here. Sit around.

13:41.619 --> 13:42.733
Come on. Let's go.

13:43.662 --> 13:45.821
Sit up.
I want you to look into the light.

13:46.582 --> 13:48.326
Okay? Come here.

13:50.379 --> 13:53.498
Follow this just with your eyes,
not your head.

13:53.674 --> 13:55.916
Look at that.
The swelling went down.

13:56.845 --> 13:59.336
Follow the light with your eyes,
not your head.

14:00.181 --> 14:02.887
How's your head? Any confusion?

14:05.354 --> 14:06.730
What year is it?

14:07.189 --> 14:10.441
December '95, according to
this hot magazine you gave me.

14:10.611 --> 14:12.936
Did you know Michael and Lisa Marie
are splitting up?

14:13.113 --> 14:15.985
What was I supposed to do?
Let you go back out on the street?

14:16.367 --> 14:18.905
Like I haven't been beaten worse
when I lived at home.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.279
- You having any trouble seeing?
- No.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.576
I get these little blobs.

14:24.585 --> 14:26.210
What kind of blobs?

14:26.587 --> 14:30.337
- Open your eye.
- Dark spots floating around.

14:31.677 --> 14:33.420
Any flashes of light?

14:33.595 --> 14:35.470
Sometimes when you get
a blow to the head...

14:35.682 --> 14:39.051
...there's retinal detachment.
An ophthalmologist will look at it.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.511
In the meantime, lay back down, okay?

14:42.732 --> 14:45.686
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any more boring.

14:48.571 --> 14:51.739
If I go blind, can they still
send me to the nut house?

14:52.242 --> 14:55.909
- That's not where you're going.
- Oh, good. Then just to jail.

15:03.089 --> 15:05.331
You're going somewhere
so you'll be safe.

15:05.842 --> 15:07.502
I should've lied...

15:09.095 --> 15:10.674
...and said I wasn't raped.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.424
That's why you locked me up.

15:15.352 --> 15:16.764
You're on a hold...

15:18.523 --> 15:19.768
...for your own good.

15:20.901 --> 15:22.644
Like it was my fault.

15:24.739 --> 15:26.981
I should've just said it was sex.

15:27.408 --> 15:29.781
It's not like there's much
of a difference.

15:31.121 --> 15:32.616
Like any of it matters.

15:36.962 --> 15:39.120
Don't let them put me in a home.

15:40.298 --> 15:41.958
I won't.

15:42.968 --> 15:44.760
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

15:46.222 --> 15:47.764
Please.

15:57.277 --> 15:59.317
- Guess.
- No more roses!

15:59.488 --> 16:02.026
I mean, I love the roses.
They were beautiful.

16:02.324 --> 16:03.439
It's not roses.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.115
It's a beauty.
This thing must've cost you.

16:06.329 --> 16:08.998
Try it on.
You're gonna need it come spring.

16:09.165 --> 16:11.408
I thought we could go
to the Upper Peninsula.

16:11.585 --> 16:12.830
It's only January.

16:13.003 --> 16:14.414
What makes you think
we can't plan ahead?

16:14.588 --> 16:16.213
My last 10 relationships.

16:16.549 --> 16:19.800
Nurse's Admin is coming down
to discuss-

16:20.387 --> 16:22.795
- What are you rebelling against?
- What have you got?

16:22.973 --> 16:25.132
Weaver, without a chart,
in Curtain 3.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.427
I got distracted. All his fault.

16:28.563 --> 16:31.767
Does Admin want to discuss
our situation?

16:31.942 --> 16:33.437
You mean the nurses' sickout?

16:33.611 --> 16:35.022
- Chuny.
- That's what it is.

16:35.196 --> 16:38.648
- Would you stay and help me out?
- The nurses have to stick together.

16:38.825 --> 16:40.533
- I'm a nurse.
- And a manager.

16:41.829 --> 16:45.080
Don't ask me to break ranks.
It's too hard to say no to you.

16:47.961 --> 16:49.870
- She's great.
- Yeah.

16:50.046 --> 16:51.328
Heard from Susan?

16:52.216 --> 16:56.084
If you think I'm just reacting to Susan
leaving, you're completely wrong.

16:57.054 --> 16:58.550
I'm completely wrong.

17:01.727 --> 17:05.060
Picked this guy up at the
airport shuttle. He's diaphoretic.

17:05.272 --> 17:07.978
Temp's 103. BP's 70/50.

17:08.151 --> 17:10.559
Vomited three times en route.
Diarrhea too.

17:10.737 --> 17:13.358
- You don't want to go near my rig.
- Find Dr. Greene.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.734
Okay, on my count.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.909
One, two, three.

17:19.915 --> 17:23.284
- One liter of saline.
- Pulse ox is 98 percent on 5 liters.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.871
Temp's 103.6.

17:25.297 --> 17:27.760
Five of Compazine and
Tylenol, 10-grain suppository.

17:27.795 --> 17:29.544
Mix a dopamine drip.

17:29.718 --> 17:32.044
- What do you got?
- He was picked up at the airport.

17:32.263 --> 17:34.469
- Departing or arriving?
- Here. Let me check.

17:34.682 --> 17:35.713
Cap refill's poor.

17:35.892 --> 17:39.262
Let's get a CBC, Chem-7,
urine C & S, chest film.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.896
According to his ticket,
Mr. Hecht just flew in from Paris.

17:43.734 --> 17:46.143
His original point of departure
was Libreville.

17:46.321 --> 17:48.148
- Where's that?
- Gabon, West Africa.

17:48.365 --> 17:49.824
Everybody get masks on.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.406
I'll mask the patient.
What are you thinking?

17:52.620 --> 17:55.242
I'd like to get a consult
from Infectious Disease.

17:55.456 --> 17:57.994
Isn't Gabon one of the places
they found the Ebola virus?

17:58.167 --> 18:01.584
Let's set up an isolation room.
Keep caregivers down to a minimum.

18:01.797 --> 18:04.004
I'll stay with Mr. Hecht.
I started the case.

18:08.805 --> 18:11.427
How'd it go?
Best man pull through?

18:12.643 --> 18:13.842
Lost his spleen.

18:14.020 --> 18:17.519
I finished my rounds. Did you want me
to take Dennis' patients too?

18:17.732 --> 18:19.809
No. I'll do them.

18:24.615 --> 18:26.858
You know, I bumped
into Dr. Morgenstern.

18:28.328 --> 18:31.246
He told me the police have ruled
Dennis' death an accident.

18:33.293 --> 18:36.329
- Is that what you think it was?
- It's easier for everyone-

18:36.504 --> 18:37.535
For his family.

18:37.714 --> 18:40.716
Easier on everyone.
But that doesn't mean it's true.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.134
Why do you care what I think?

18:43.304 --> 18:46.340
Because you and I knew Dennis
better than anybody here.

18:46.515 --> 18:50.265
I'm not your friend Keaton. If she was
here, she'd hash over this thing with you.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.021
But you know that's not me.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.560
Peter?

18:53.775 --> 18:55.767
There you are.
When it rains, it pours.

18:55.985 --> 18:59.520
Dissecting aneurysm coming down
from ICU. Care to join me?

18:59.739 --> 19:00.985
I'd love to.

19:01.742 --> 19:03.153
Have you finished your rounds?

19:03.369 --> 19:04.780
- Yes, I have.
- He's covering the ER.

19:04.954 --> 19:09.035
That shouldn't stop you from joining us.
If you get paged, you can leave.

19:16.593 --> 19:19.510
I'll tell you how to do your job,
and we'll see how you take it.

19:19.679 --> 19:23.263
Charlie's not gonna do well in an
institution. Norm agrees with me.

19:23.476 --> 19:25.682
What I said was,
if she gets a chance...

19:25.853 --> 19:27.811
...she'll probably ditch out
of a group setting.

19:28.023 --> 19:30.230
That's why I'm trying
to locate the mother.

19:30.401 --> 19:31.432
Good luck with that.

19:31.652 --> 19:34.059
She was last seen in Ohio
over a year ago.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.318
You believe that?

19:36.157 --> 19:39.858
Charlie doesn't want us to find her.
That's why she's not cooperating.

19:40.036 --> 19:41.117
Such a great mom.

19:41.289 --> 19:43.246
Even a bad mom can give consent.

19:43.458 --> 19:46.031
That's what you need
for this kind of placement.

19:46.252 --> 19:50.630
If Charlie would cooperate in finding
her other relatives in Cleveland...

19:50.799 --> 19:52.342
...she could be placed with them.

19:52.551 --> 19:53.962
- And she understands that?
- Yes.

19:54.136 --> 19:55.335
Yes.

19:55.513 --> 19:57.305
But I'm the enemy.

19:58.850 --> 20:01.556
Okay, I'll give it a shot,
if I'm not stepping on your toes.

20:01.729 --> 20:04.434
No, stomp away.
We all want the same thing.

20:15.454 --> 20:18.123
Jeanie, this is Dr. Fischer
from Infectious Disease.

20:18.290 --> 20:20.033
- How's the patient?
- He's defervescing.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.825
Lytes, chest x-ray, urinalysis
were all normal.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.080
He's been conscious off and on,
but delirious.

20:25.298 --> 20:28.215
He confirmed he was working in Gabon.
Some sort of land survey.

20:28.426 --> 20:30.716
- I want a sed rate and an LP.
- Right away.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.673
- And the airline?
- Keep them on alert.

20:32.848 --> 20:35.090
I want test results
before they contact passengers.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.269
I hear hoof beats, but I haven't
seen zebras. You drew blood cultures?

20:38.438 --> 20:41.392
- Graft is holding, finally.
- Let's close.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.314
2.0 Prolene on a double arm.
Carter, suction.

20:44.529 --> 20:46.984
Come on! 2.0 Prolene.
Let's go. Let's wake up!

20:47.198 --> 20:50.200
Whole department's off today.
Everyone's still in shock.

20:50.411 --> 20:51.526
Bovie.

20:52.038 --> 20:55.288
I'm sorry I didn't get to know
Dr. Gant better.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.950
- How was working with him?
- It was too soon to say.

20:58.378 --> 20:59.541
More 2.0.

21:00.130 --> 21:03.631
- He hadn't distinguished himself yet.
- Surprising, given his transcripts.

21:03.802 --> 21:05.711
He came with
the highest recommendations.

21:05.887 --> 21:08.010
Maybe he was having
adjustment problems.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.051
So you noticed him struggling?

21:10.226 --> 21:12.717
Gant wasn't prepared to handle
an urban trauma center.

21:12.937 --> 21:15.060
Then why did you give him
a positive report?

21:15.231 --> 21:16.726
- Sorry?
- You heard me.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.898
Why did you praise him for his
improved technical skills and initiative...

21:21.071 --> 21:23.990
- ... in his second review?
- Perhaps at another time.

21:24.159 --> 21:27.076
I gave that review to Gant
before he had some recent backsliding.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.493
I wasn't even aware he received
that evaluation.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.239
He hadn't. It came today.

21:32.460 --> 21:36.410
You can be sure he never received
any encouraging word from you.

21:36.590 --> 21:39.128
Candy, take over suction.
You're excused, Dr. Carter.

21:39.343 --> 21:42.463
All he ever got from you
was harping and criticism.

21:43.390 --> 21:47.222
And now he's dead,
and you're gonna have to face it.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.390
My apologies, Dr. Hicks.

22:00.868 --> 22:02.991
- You don't like the roses?
- I love the roses.

22:03.203 --> 22:05.411
Just slow down.
You don't have to impress me.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.197
I just passed the florist
and thought about you.

22:08.376 --> 22:11.165
But in my family, if a man
sends flowers twice in one week...

22:11.380 --> 22:15.425
...the only thing left is conversion
to Catholicism, marriage and seven kids.

22:16.260 --> 22:19.097
Should I look over my shoulder
for your father with a shotgun?

22:19.306 --> 22:21.014
My brother Julio.
He packs a. 45.

22:21.225 --> 22:23.930
- There you are.
- Looks like 100 percent participation.

22:24.145 --> 22:25.889
We have no nurses
in exactly one hour.

22:26.106 --> 22:30.269
This is Roger Drummond from
Labor Relations. You know Mary Cain.

22:30.485 --> 22:32.693
Our attorneys are filing
an injunction.

22:32.905 --> 22:36.405
An organized work stoppage
is illegal under their contract.

22:36.576 --> 22:39.744
No one was actually stupid enough
to admit to an organized sickout?

22:39.914 --> 22:43.247
- I hope only this shift's affected.
- We can't stay open without nurses.

22:43.417 --> 22:45.660
I've rounded up some
private-duty nurses.

22:45.879 --> 22:48.584
And also some nurse managers
from other departments.

22:48.757 --> 22:51.129
- Oh, boy.
- I can come down myself.

22:51.344 --> 22:53.669
The extra bodies will help
with non-emergent cases.

22:53.846 --> 22:55.720
The hospital prefers not to cave.

22:55.932 --> 22:58.602
At least we should stay
closed to trauma.

22:59.019 --> 23:01.095
- I agree with Carol.
- Me too.

23:01.689 --> 23:05.023
All right.
We close to trauma, 3:00 sharp.

23:05.193 --> 23:07.684
I'll call the paramedics,
let them know to divert.

23:11.701 --> 23:14.453
- How's she doing?
- No signs of retinal detachment.

23:14.662 --> 23:17.699
- What about the blobs?
- Most people have floaters.

23:17.874 --> 23:21.042
You probably notice them more
as you've been recovering.

23:21.253 --> 23:22.878
When will this stuff wear off?

23:23.089 --> 23:27.087
Your vision will be normal
in an hour or so. Wear these.

23:27.844 --> 23:29.837
Thanks for checking her out, doc.

23:30.013 --> 23:31.556
Any time, Dr. Ross.

23:31.723 --> 23:33.135
You have a very nice daughter.

23:33.309 --> 23:37.058
- She's not my daughter! Who said that?
- It was just a joke.

23:39.108 --> 23:41.101
Cool! These are trippy.
Everything's a blur.

23:41.277 --> 23:43.982
- Why did you tell Dr. Zogoiby that?
- That you're my dad?

23:44.197 --> 23:46.949
- You're old enough.
- Half the time you clam up...

23:47.117 --> 23:49.787
...and the other half
you're taking back lies you told.

23:49.953 --> 23:51.033
So?

23:51.205 --> 23:53.779
So you're making it tough
for people to help you.

23:53.958 --> 23:56.829
You cooperate,
then Social Services can find a relative...

23:57.003 --> 23:59.246
...or get consent
for somebody to take you in.

23:59.423 --> 24:01.381
- Like who?
- You gotta help them figure that out.

24:01.592 --> 24:03.336
Stop lying to people.

24:03.511 --> 24:06.217
Like adults don't lie
every chance they get?

24:12.646 --> 24:14.272
Why don't you have any kids?

24:14.482 --> 24:16.190
I get my fill on the job.

24:16.359 --> 24:19.029
So this truth thing's
a one-way street.

24:19.237 --> 24:20.353
I get it.

24:23.451 --> 24:26.536
I haven't gotten it together
long enough to stay with a woman...

24:26.747 --> 24:30.959
...let alone family and babies
and long-term commitments.

24:31.126 --> 24:34.247
You wouldn't have to have a baby
if you had a foster kid.

24:35.257 --> 24:36.537
Anybody in particular?

24:37.300 --> 24:40.302
A teenager wouldn't be
that long of a commitment.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.719
I'm practically grown up already.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.056
If I were ready,
you'd be first on my list.

24:49.481 --> 24:51.308
You've used that on women,
haven't you?

24:51.484 --> 24:52.812
I have.

24:53.445 --> 24:54.820
There you are.

24:54.988 --> 24:57.111
- So how are the eyes?
- She's doing fine.

24:57.324 --> 25:01.323
Good. Well, I'm sure her mother
will be relieved to hear that.

25:01.537 --> 25:03.364
You found her in Cleveland?

25:03.539 --> 25:07.075
On South Des Plaines Avenue, 10 blocks
away, where she and Charlie live.

25:07.628 --> 25:11.377
My God, Charlie!
I was freaking. I was so worried.

25:11.799 --> 25:14.469
Look at you.
What did I tell you would happen?

25:14.636 --> 25:16.712
You're gonna end up
with scars from this.

25:16.888 --> 25:18.762
When are you gonna listen to me?

25:18.974 --> 25:22.142
I can't turn my back for a second,
you're out the door.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.062
- Dr. Pomerantz?
- Yes.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.974
Dr. Anspaugh said you might
be available today for counseling...

25:28.194 --> 25:31.148
- ... for those of us who knew Dennis Gant.
- That's right.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.278
They've set up an office for me
on the Surgical Ward.

25:35.494 --> 25:37.570
Room 820.
I'll be there till 6.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.911
I don't know if I can make it today.

25:40.082 --> 25:42.752
I meant to stop by earlier,
but I got called into surgery.

25:42.961 --> 25:46.661
- Are you an intern?
- Yeah, yeah. John Carter.

25:46.881 --> 25:48.507
Oh, you're John Carter.

25:49.051 --> 25:52.634
Dennis mentioned you a few times.
You were his friend.

25:52.805 --> 25:54.347
Oh. You knew Dennis?

25:54.558 --> 25:56.764
He came for counseling
when he first arrived.

25:56.977 --> 25:58.934
But after a few sessions, he stopped.

25:59.146 --> 26:00.344
I see.

26:00.564 --> 26:04.183
I'm really very sorry. I know
how hard it is to lose a friend.

26:04.861 --> 26:06.854
I hope you'll come by and talk.

26:10.034 --> 26:13.368
When Dennis quit therapy,
did you think that it was okay?

26:13.579 --> 26:17.115
I mean, did you feel it was
all right for him to stop?

26:17.334 --> 26:20.454
I didn't disagree with it,
his stopping, at the time.

26:20.671 --> 26:24.586
He seemed to be settling in,
developing a support system.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.554
There's a survivor's guilt that comes
with any unexpected death.

26:32.894 --> 26:35.468
Maybe I feel guilty because I am.

26:36.357 --> 26:38.148
You should come and see me.

26:39.151 --> 26:40.645
I'll try.

26:48.662 --> 26:50.371
I'll try to remember your names...

26:50.581 --> 26:54.116
...but please have your ID tags
where they can be seen.

26:54.460 --> 26:57.877
- Bye, Lily. Bye, Haleh.
- Goodbye, Carol. Good luck.

26:58.340 --> 27:02.041
- Has anyone worked ER before?
- Twenty years ago. I hated it.

27:02.261 --> 27:04.753
We're closed to trauma.
That'll ease the workload.

27:04.973 --> 27:07.594
And please, if you have questions, ask.

27:07.809 --> 27:09.305
- Later.
- A quarter till?

27:09.520 --> 27:11.560
- I can meet you there.
- I'll pick you up.

27:11.773 --> 27:12.804
Bye, Chuny.

27:12.982 --> 27:15.271
If they win this,
it'll be good for nurses.

27:15.443 --> 27:18.065
It's not that simple.
County's gotta find the money.

27:18.280 --> 27:21.115
They can check my bank account.
It's not in there.

27:21.617 --> 27:25.616
I'll send these up to the lab.
Cell count and diff, protein, glucose...

27:25.831 --> 27:28.119
- ... India ink and culture.
- Exactly.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.371
Nice to see you again.
Did we find you something exotic?

27:31.546 --> 27:35.045
We've all seen way too many movies.
No ecchymosis or bleeding or rash.

27:35.216 --> 27:36.379
It doesn't suggest Ebola.

27:36.552 --> 27:38.794
Meet me in the lab.
We'll make the Giemsa stains.

27:38.971 --> 27:40.928
We have techs who will do that.

27:41.098 --> 27:44.136
I'm an old-fashioned lab rat.
I like to do it myself.

27:45.687 --> 27:49.139
Greg's wonderful. I should've
thought of him for you earlier.

27:49.358 --> 27:51.980
- Kerry.
- As your doctor.

27:52.195 --> 27:55.279
There's no reason for you to drive out
to Highland Park anymore.

27:55.490 --> 27:59.405
Greg's very respected for his work
with HIV patients.

27:59.578 --> 28:02.449
He left a successful private practice
to come to County...

28:02.665 --> 28:04.991
...after his partner died
of AIDS last summer.

28:05.168 --> 28:07.410
- That's too bad.
- You ought to think about it.

28:07.588 --> 28:08.833
Yeah. Maybe I will.

28:10.675 --> 28:13.344
She's not even a runaway.
Her mom lives 10 minutes away.

28:13.553 --> 28:14.881
Sounds like a case herself.

28:15.096 --> 28:18.597
Letting her kid run the streets
all hours of the day and night.

28:18.809 --> 28:21.265
What do you think?
Chop House for Valentine's Day?

28:21.479 --> 28:23.518
I'd love to, but you're not my type.

28:23.731 --> 28:27.101
I know. It's not very romantic,
but it's Chuny's favorite.

28:28.195 --> 28:30.353
They gonna send Charlie
home with her mom?

28:30.572 --> 28:32.815
There's a cooling-off period
where the DCFS...

28:33.034 --> 28:36.486
...figures out which end is up.
And I'm on my way to the gym.

28:36.705 --> 28:38.615
Sounds like she's in safe hands.

28:38.791 --> 28:40.950
Thank God for Social Services.

28:45.299 --> 28:47.588
Hey, Carter, can I get you anything?

28:55.018 --> 28:57.973
I could get used to being
closed to trauma.

28:58.147 --> 29:00.104
I was actually hoping
for something to do.

29:00.316 --> 29:02.107
Doesn't feel real, does it?

29:02.527 --> 29:04.935
I just keep waiting for Dennis
to come in...

29:05.155 --> 29:07.444
...and tell everybody it was
a big mistake.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.486
You couldn't have done anything.

29:10.703 --> 29:12.162
I know that.

29:14.166 --> 29:16.158
I just don't believe that.

29:16.835 --> 29:19.837
Help! Somebody help my friend,
please! He's dying!

29:20.006 --> 29:23.209
- Okay, on a count-
- Don't! His leg is barely hanging on!

29:23.426 --> 29:25.835
- What happened?
- Gil was taking a nap in the alley.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.846
They dropped a Dumpster on him.

29:28.015 --> 29:29.924
I dragged it off him
and called for help...

29:30.100 --> 29:32.675
...but no cars would stop.
I couldn't find a phone.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.180
The paramedics
wouldn't have brought you here.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.515
You saved your friend
a ride across town.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.982
Get the doctors.
Get all the doctors!

29:40.154 --> 29:43.191
- Let's try the other slide.
- Okay.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.068
Thanks.

29:46.287 --> 29:48.078
- Want to take a shot?
- Sure.

29:51.042 --> 29:54.328
- Know what you're looking for?
- Hoop-shaped rings, like Saturn.

29:54.588 --> 29:56.877
Exactly. You like astronomy?

29:57.090 --> 30:00.757
My fifth-grade science project
was on comets. I'm an expert.

30:00.970 --> 30:04.174
You must be excited about
the appearance of Hale-Bopp.

30:04.390 --> 30:07.511
It's a comet that was just
discovered this month.

30:07.686 --> 30:09.644
- Do you have your own telescope?
- Careful.

30:09.814 --> 30:12.269
You'll get me started on
a new set of useless facts.

30:12.483 --> 30:16.352
I thought about getting a telescope.
Can you see much with the city lights?

30:16.780 --> 30:19.735
You should join me for a comet watch.
I usually set up outside the Adler.

30:19.909 --> 30:21.285
I'd love to sometime.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.825
How about tonight?
It's supposed to be crystal clear.

30:23.997 --> 30:26.571
But bundle up.
At 4, a chill comes off the lake.

30:26.751 --> 30:27.830
4 a. m.?

30:28.002 --> 30:30.291
It's only visible in the predawn sky.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.502
Hey, wait. Look.
I think I found some. Take a look.

30:34.510 --> 30:36.965
Am I right? They have rings,
more than one.

30:37.179 --> 30:39.587
That's it.
The asexual form of the parasite.

30:39.808 --> 30:42.096
- It's plain old malaria.
- Good news for Mr. Hecht?

30:42.268 --> 30:46.349
Chloroquine, 10-milligram IV
followed by a 15-milligram drip.

30:48.818 --> 30:51.854
Hey, you know,
I'm usually awake at 4 a. m. anyway.

30:53.114 --> 30:55.072
- I'll bring the coffee.
- Great.

30:58.954 --> 31:00.533
O- neg is here. Four units.

31:00.749 --> 31:03.240
Thanks. Ask Radiology
what's taking so long.

31:03.418 --> 31:05.991
Get on the rapid infuser.
I got a pumper! Femoral artery!

31:06.213 --> 31:07.589
Four-by-fours for Dr. Greene.

31:07.757 --> 31:09.880
- Gauze?
- Four-by-fours.

31:10.718 --> 31:11.749
Come on!

31:13.764 --> 31:15.424
- Gil, come on.
- He's thready.

31:15.599 --> 31:18.636
Pressure's 60.
Heart rate's 140. Pulse ox, 90.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.769
- How's that lavage coming?
- I need Betadine.

31:20.939 --> 31:22.599
Coming up. Watch out!

31:23.358 --> 31:25.896
- I need some help with this tape.
- Okay, I got it.

31:26.111 --> 31:28.947
- Who's on the infuser?
- I'll get it. Just a sec.

31:31.826 --> 31:34.032
Positive lavage.
We got internal bleeding.

31:34.204 --> 31:36.281
- I need a thigh cuff.
- Thigh cuff for Dr. Greene.

31:36.457 --> 31:38.948
Upper right drawer.
Right drawer. Up.

31:39.126 --> 31:40.157
Found it.

31:41.296 --> 31:43.039
- He's fibrillating.
- I'll start compressions.

31:43.215 --> 31:45.706
Let's shock him. Paddles, Carter, 200.

31:45.884 --> 31:46.915
Everybody up!

31:48.721 --> 31:50.097
No juice.

31:50.974 --> 31:52.384
Carol?

31:52.725 --> 31:55.052
Hit the sync switch. Turn it off.

31:56.355 --> 31:57.386
- Am I set?
- Yeah.

31:57.565 --> 31:59.225
Clear!

32:01.026 --> 32:02.688
Come on, Gil.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.487
Three hundred. Clear!

32:08.328 --> 32:10.154
Is he dying? Is he dying?

32:10.371 --> 32:12.613
- Is my buddy dying?
- We're doing our best.

32:12.832 --> 32:15.371
- Why don't you wait outside.
-360. Clear!

32:16.378 --> 32:18.336
- He's my friend!
- I know! I know!

32:18.506 --> 32:19.881
Give me an amp of epi.

32:20.508 --> 32:23.463
- I tried to get him here.
- Shut this guy up!

32:23.637 --> 32:26.128
It's my fault! I let him down!

32:26.348 --> 32:28.139
Let's shock him again at 360. Clear!

32:28.350 --> 32:30.807
- He's my buddy, and I let him down!
- Okay! We got it!

32:31.020 --> 32:32.515
- Get him out of here!
- Let's go!

32:33.189 --> 32:35.432
No, you didn't. At least you tried!

32:37.028 --> 32:38.688
- Kerry, can you cover for me?
- Go on.

32:38.863 --> 32:40.191
Go on. Come on.

32:40.698 --> 32:43.534
Let's try him again at 360. Clear!

33:15.488 --> 33:17.981
I knew Dennis was having a hard time.

33:20.995 --> 33:23.404
I knew he was in trouble...

33:24.083 --> 33:26.704
...but I was too busy...

33:27.836 --> 33:31.088
...and I just didn't want
to get dragged down.

33:31.967 --> 33:33.295
I didn't listen.

33:34.427 --> 33:37.632
You're in the middle
of your first year of Residency.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.340
You're working at an inhuman pace.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.845
Why am I doing it again?

33:43.480 --> 33:47.264
Because you were trying to learn
a job where lives are at stake.

33:47.443 --> 33:50.017
I didn't save Dennis' life though, did I?

33:51.239 --> 33:53.232
You don't know that you could have.

33:58.581 --> 34:00.657
I know that I wasn't much of a friend.

34:10.302 --> 34:12.973
I'll collect the sharps.
You check off the dispensed meds.

34:13.181 --> 34:16.266
- You don't have to do that.
- I don't mind chipping in.

34:16.476 --> 34:18.766
Number 11 lavage blade...

34:18.980 --> 34:20.973
...two needles from a central line.

34:21.190 --> 34:24.607
All right.
Three epi, 100 of lidocaine.

34:24.777 --> 34:27.733
I wanted to compliment you
on how you handled yourself today.

34:27.947 --> 34:30.618
It isn't easy to be a manager
when it's hitting the fan...

34:30.827 --> 34:33.152
...and your workers are your friends.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.746
Two IV needles.

34:34.956 --> 34:37.661
Thanks. It's been pretty awful
around here lately.

34:37.877 --> 34:41.827
I think of myself as a nurse, and I'm
wading through this management crap.

34:42.047 --> 34:46.177
Two of O-neg, empty, two unused.
You waded through it very gracefully.

34:46.344 --> 34:48.137
Isn't there three of O-neg?

34:48.973 --> 34:50.716
Oh. Yeah, here it is.

34:53.645 --> 34:56.101
No. This one is marked A-pos.

34:56.273 --> 34:57.815
What?

34:57.984 --> 34:59.609
Did we order type-specific?

34:59.819 --> 35:02.310
It never came down.
I mean, where did this...?

35:02.947 --> 35:05.071
God, this must've been on the infuser!

35:05.701 --> 35:07.741
There's blood in the Foley bag.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.362
Oh, my God!
I gave him the wrong blood.

35:17.506 --> 35:20.212
This unit of A-positive
must have been left on the infuser.

35:20.427 --> 35:22.918
When I started it up,
I'm sure there was a bag on there.

35:23.138 --> 35:26.590
I just thought someone had hung it.
I didn't check the label.

35:26.809 --> 35:29.514
Have you sent an EDT A-treated sample
to be re-cross-matched?

35:29.729 --> 35:32.565
Yeah. It showed massive
intravascular hemolysis.

35:32.775 --> 35:36.523
I gave type-A blood
to a type-O patient. I killed him.

35:36.737 --> 35:39.229
- He was bleeding out anyway.
- We've saved worse.

35:39.449 --> 35:42.022
It was an honest mistake.
You were the only RN.

35:42.202 --> 35:44.408
We were all filling in roles
we weren't accustomed to.

35:44.830 --> 35:47.156
It still doesn't take away
the basic error.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.700
I did not check the label.

35:49.919 --> 35:53.371
We're saying that if you determined
an incident report was unnecessary...

35:53.549 --> 35:54.747
...we wouldn't pursue it.

35:56.927 --> 35:59.087
- Am I speaking out of turn?
- No.

35:59.306 --> 36:02.307
You could've thrown the empty bag
in the hazardous waste...

36:02.476 --> 36:04.634
- ... and been done with it.
- That's true.

36:06.606 --> 36:10.022
But I'd still have to look at myself
in the mirror every day.

36:18.452 --> 36:20.909
Thank you for making the arrangements,
Dr. Carter.

36:21.123 --> 36:24.124
And the sentiments you expressed
set just the right tone.

36:24.334 --> 36:27.751
I want to apologize about
what happened earlier in surgery.

36:27.964 --> 36:29.339
You already did.

36:31.926 --> 36:34.418
- Did I miss it?
- Yeah.

36:35.556 --> 36:38.094
Mr. Gant, this is Dr. Benton,
who you were asking about.

36:38.309 --> 36:40.386
Dr. Benton, this is Dennis Gant Sr.

36:40.604 --> 36:42.098
He was hoping to meet you.

36:42.314 --> 36:43.891
My sympathies are with you
and your family.

36:44.066 --> 36:46.736
- Thank you, doctor.
- I'm sorry I missed the service.

36:46.903 --> 36:51.612
Dennis' e-mail gave me a sense
of how demanding your schedules are.

36:52.534 --> 36:56.367
In fact, I had to admonish my son
for taking time to write home at all.

36:57.456 --> 36:59.496
I didn't want him to neglect
his workload.

37:00.126 --> 37:03.710
I know that Dennis greatly respected
your work...

37:04.214 --> 37:05.839
...and looked up to you.

37:06.968 --> 37:08.676
Well, I'm afraid I was...

37:10.889 --> 37:13.380
...a bit tough on your son.

37:14.935 --> 37:16.560
Maybe Dr. Carter filled you in.

37:16.771 --> 37:20.222
- No, I haven't.
- You have to be tough. Life is.

37:20.651 --> 37:23.901
I wasn't entirely convinced
that my boy should've...

37:24.071 --> 37:26.906
...chosen such an ambitious specialty.

37:28.326 --> 37:30.235
But I didn't raise a quitter.

37:31.538 --> 37:33.412
I hope he didn't disappoint you.

37:35.251 --> 37:37.374
No, your son worked very hard.

37:38.421 --> 37:40.413
And I think he...

37:40.966 --> 37:43.291
...would've made an excellent surgeon.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.057
Oh, I am so late.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.678
What a day, huh?

37:50.894 --> 37:53.599
You know, you and Dr. Fischer
make a good team.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.270
We're getting together later.
He's an astronomy buff.

37:56.484 --> 37:58.275
You have a date with Greg Fischer?

37:58.444 --> 38:01.695
No. Not a date. In some ways,
it's perfect that he's gay.

38:01.907 --> 38:03.651
What makes you think he's gay?

38:03.826 --> 38:05.653
- Well, you said-
- He isn't gay.

38:07.454 --> 38:11.500
- You said his partner died of AIDS.
- His partner in his medical practice.

38:11.710 --> 38:12.824
Not his lover.

38:13.336 --> 38:18.332
Oh, my God! Greg Fischer is one of the
most eligible heterosexuals in Chicago.

38:18.634 --> 38:20.627
- So he thinks this is a date.
- It is a date.

38:20.845 --> 38:23.467
- I can't go.
- Don't be silly.

38:23.641 --> 38:25.550
I didn't tell him I'm HIV-positive.

38:25.768 --> 38:29.636
It's just a date. Get to know him.
You're entitled to a date.

38:29.815 --> 38:31.854
Really. Go. Have fun.

38:32.067 --> 38:34.143
I expect to hear all about it tomorrow.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.365
- Have you seen E-Ray?
- He's helping one of the temp nurses.

38:44.582 --> 38:46.989
Not with a patient.
With her astrological chart.

38:47.209 --> 38:48.751
Is Dr. Fischer in?

38:48.962 --> 38:51.631
I see. Is he on pager, by chance? No?

38:51.840 --> 38:55.007
- No? Okay, thanks.
- Carol, good news.

38:55.177 --> 38:58.179
The union blinked first.
Nurses will be back on the morning shift.

38:58.348 --> 39:02.512
Well, you saved me a trip from upstairs.
I needed to give you this.

39:02.770 --> 39:04.679
During a trauma that came in privately...

39:04.855 --> 39:07.263
...I gave the patient the wrong blood,
and he died.

39:07.441 --> 39:10.479
- Oh, my God.
- Patient's family aware of the error?

39:10.654 --> 39:13.275
He was a transient.
He had no family members.

39:13.490 --> 39:14.771
Well, that's fortunate.

39:15.659 --> 39:17.035
What?

39:17.370 --> 39:20.490
I'll look over the report,
but don't beat yourself up.

39:20.665 --> 39:22.825
The sickout contribute
to this man's demise?

39:23.002 --> 39:26.702
No, it was my error.
I didn't check the label.

39:26.922 --> 39:29.295
I'm gonna have to write this up,
of course.

39:29.508 --> 39:32.760
But I think in view of
the circumstances of the day...

39:33.263 --> 39:35.671
...we may be able to forego
an investigation.

39:35.849 --> 39:38.222
I don't want any special favors here.

39:38.686 --> 39:42.519
I stayed on today because
as a manager I'm required to.

39:43.484 --> 39:44.729
I understand.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.155
The mom admits
there've been fights in the house.

39:49.323 --> 39:51.151
She claims she can't keep Charlie in.

39:51.368 --> 39:54.286
Sounds more like the mom's
not in much herself.

39:54.538 --> 39:58.703
She confirmed the abuse by one,
if not two, of her boyfriends in the past.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.041
- Why'd you page me?
- Charlie's making claims.

40:01.254 --> 40:02.879
- Against me?
- Not accusations.

40:03.048 --> 40:06.797
Norm and I felt that it would be best
if we hashed it out together.

40:10.557 --> 40:12.100
I appreciate you coming.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.811
- What's up?
- Thank you for taking care of her.

40:17.022 --> 40:19.349
- It's my job.
- But so many don't care.

40:19.526 --> 40:21.186
Or just don't take the time.

40:21.528 --> 40:23.437
I was out of my mind when I heard.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.779
I thought she was babysitting.

40:25.950 --> 40:29.651
I was updating Dr. Ross about
the problems at home.

40:31.373 --> 40:35.418
I won't say I don't have a temper,
and I've made a lot of mistakes.

40:35.586 --> 40:39.419
But I love Charlie like crazy,
and I just want her to find something.

40:39.591 --> 40:41.418
I know she can't go out
on her own, but-

40:41.593 --> 40:45.806
So I told them what you told me about
how my mom could give consent.

40:45.973 --> 40:47.931
Adele would know more about that.

40:48.101 --> 40:50.971
Charlie means parental consent
for her to live with you.

40:51.146 --> 40:54.350
- She believes you agreed to that.
- Like we said, I'm almost grown up.

40:54.525 --> 40:57.859
I wouldn't be around all the time.
I mean, I'd be in school.

40:58.071 --> 41:01.405
And I can see you're a good man
and a doctor.

41:01.616 --> 41:04.368
I'm not giving up my daughter.
She needs a good influence.

41:04.536 --> 41:08.701
That isn't what we talked about.
In fact, it's the opposite.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.746
- Charlie was mistaken.
- We could do it. They'd let us.

41:11.921 --> 41:15.254
So you were lying? You see what it's
like with her? You make me nuts!

41:15.424 --> 41:18.176
- I can't do this.
- Why not? I'd do whatever you said.

41:18.345 --> 41:20.883
Adele and Dr. Middleton can help you.

41:21.056 --> 41:23.629
Screw Adele and Dr. Middleton!
And screw Mom!

41:23.850 --> 41:26.140
It's all a bunch of crap!
I'll run away for good!

41:26.312 --> 41:29.349
You know it, and it'll be your fault!
I hate you!

41:29.524 --> 41:33.024
- Maybe you should go.
- Go! Go on! Get out of my face!

41:42.331 --> 41:43.741
I'm half-frozen!

41:44.291 --> 41:47.791
The snow was supposed to stop.
You didn't even get a glimpse.

41:48.004 --> 41:50.791
We'll have to try that again,
like in June, July...

41:51.007 --> 41:52.038
Two hot chocolates.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.294
- You want something to eat?
- Yeah, maybe.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.967
I'm afraid I'm not hardy enough
for astronomy.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.212
Or crazy enough.

41:59.101 --> 42:01.639
I've never been that interested
in the stars themselves.

42:01.854 --> 42:03.597
It's the stories behind them.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.646
There's some great myths.
Have a favorite?

42:05.817 --> 42:08.652
I like the gruesome ones
like Cassiopeia.

42:08.820 --> 42:12.355
- Turned to stone by Medusa.
- You sure she didn't freeze stargazing?

42:12.532 --> 42:15.570
Actually, she's sitting there,
waiting for the man of her dreams.

42:15.786 --> 42:18.574
Remember? She's searching
for a nice, upstanding guy.

42:18.790 --> 42:20.451
He can even be a bit of a nerd.

42:20.626 --> 42:23.580
As long as he's not
completely lacking in spontaneity.

42:32.597 --> 42:33.879
I'm sorry.

42:34.392 --> 42:36.930
No, I'm sorry. No. It's my fault.

42:37.145 --> 42:38.805
I just didn't expect that.

42:39.021 --> 42:40.433
But did you like it?

42:41.692 --> 42:42.771
Yes, I did.

42:46.405 --> 42:48.446
But, Greg...

42:57.251 --> 42:59.078
...I'm HIV-positive.

43:11.977 --> 43:15.145
I should've told you,
but I didn't think it was a date.

43:15.315 --> 43:17.141
- That's okay.
- No. I should've.

43:17.317 --> 43:19.393
But I was having fun.

43:19.944 --> 43:20.977
So...

43:24.408 --> 43:25.439
Here you go.

43:37.549 --> 43:40.040
- Did you want to order anything?
- No.

43:40.218 --> 43:42.544
No, thanks. I'm fine.

44:22.476 --> 44:27.185
I know I was hard on Gant. I thought
it was the best way for him to learn.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.107
And I don't blame you.

44:29.610 --> 44:31.768
No more than I blame myself.

44:32.529 --> 44:37.109
I just feel like I have been
walking around with this secret...

44:37.494 --> 44:40.032
...and you're the only person
who knows it.

44:40.538 --> 44:42.034
And you won't admit to it.

44:46.504 --> 44:49.874
You know, a few years ago,
I went to my high-school reunion.

44:50.843 --> 44:52.835
North Lawndale.
Jackie got it in her head.

44:53.012 --> 44:56.382
It wasn't much of a turnout because
half of the class had dropped out.

44:56.600 --> 45:00.514
I didn't know the others. My parents
tried to keep me from bad influences.

45:00.687 --> 45:02.645
But here I am with them, you know?

45:03.399 --> 45:08.227
And a third of the guys are in prison,
and I bet another third are dead.

45:08.446 --> 45:11.365
You hear about this one
and that one over the years.

45:11.533 --> 45:13.076
But this night...

45:14.453 --> 45:16.992
...I'm just struck by
the sheer numbers.

45:22.421 --> 45:25.956
I don't know what to think
of Gant's death.

45:27.969 --> 45:32.181
But, Carter, I don't need you
to tell me how I feel.

45:35.853 --> 45:37.811
You want to go through this alone?

45:38.899 --> 45:41.816
You want to make this
into something...

45:42.486 --> 45:44.645
...that I don't know about?

45:44.822 --> 45:46.815
I guess you can.

45:48.618 --> 45:52.237
We'll both keep our distance.
We'll both do our work.

45:53.416 --> 45:55.408
Pretend like nothing happened.

45:56.753 --> 45:58.461
We're good at that.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.871
Look what that did for Dennis Gant.
