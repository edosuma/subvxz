01:55.328 --> 01:57.796
So, you can clearly read the movement...

01:57.864 --> 01:59.923
on this seismograph, gentlemen.

02:00.133 --> 02:03.296
It's recording movement
in the Earth's crust.

02:03.370 --> 02:07.500
A small movement, but a movement
that I have induced scientifically.

02:07.574 --> 02:10.098
You mean you're creating
a very small earthquake?

02:10.176 --> 02:12.839
And that's not just the effect
caused by the explosion?

02:18.351 --> 02:20.046
We can't be positive, General...

02:20.120 --> 02:22.281
but you saw how
small charges of dynamite...

02:22.355 --> 02:25.324
placed according to an analysis
of the weakness of the area...

02:25.392 --> 02:27.485
caused earth tremors. Here. Watch.

02:31.731 --> 02:36.134
In this demonstration, we used
small explosions. Thus, we're in control.

02:36.703 --> 02:38.933
We never tried it full-scale.

02:39.005 --> 02:40.768
Prof. Warren is being too modest.

02:40.841 --> 02:44.675
I feel he's very near to accomplishing
the ultimate goal of the Pluto Project.

02:44.744 --> 02:47.372
The scientist is never satisfied
until the final step.

02:47.447 --> 02:50.211
Our ultimate goal
is to control and eliminate earthquakes...

02:50.283 --> 02:51.307
not create them.

02:51.384 --> 02:55.548
I've even moved forward and predicted
the following upcoming quakes:

02:56.223 --> 02:58.748
Chile, 1946. Panama, 1958.

02:58.825 --> 03:02.784
California, 1971. Alaska, I972...

03:02.863 --> 03:06.822
China, 1976, and Hawaii, 1981.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.157
Incredible.

03:08.235 --> 03:12.171
Our goal is to prevent,
not to cause earthquakes.

03:22.382 --> 03:24.748
A hansom cab ride in Central Park...

03:24.818 --> 03:26.843
chestnut vendors in Times Square...

03:26.920 --> 03:30.447
the whole world spread out before you
from atop the Empire State Building.

03:30.524 --> 03:32.924
Yes, even in this terrible war...

03:32.993 --> 03:37.896
New York can be
a very lovely and romantic place.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.001
Just remember you promised
to show me all of it.

03:43.069 --> 03:45.333
Patience, my darling. Patience.

03:45.405 --> 03:48.238
I have a very special week planned for us.

03:48.642 --> 03:52.100
Mr. Fallon, I'm sorry,
but I've been asked to detain you.

03:53.513 --> 03:57.506
Detain me? Why?
I'm traveling on a neutral passport.

03:57.584 --> 04:00.553
Yes, I know and I'm sorry,
but I have my orders.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.316
Yes, orders.

04:03.723 --> 04:06.157
- What could they want with you?
- Don't worry.

04:06.226 --> 04:09.218
- Will you follow me, please?
- One moment, please.

04:09.296 --> 04:11.787
Darling, will you ring up
the Irish Legation?

04:11.865 --> 04:14.197
Ask for Kevin Doyle. He's Chief of Protocol.

04:14.267 --> 04:17.668
And be sure to tell him I'd appreciate it
if some fuss were made.

04:17.771 --> 04:22.003
In fact, a very large fuss.

04:29.382 --> 04:33.478
Diana, I wish you could have seen
Prof. Warren's demonstration.

04:33.553 --> 04:35.077
Why, if control is perfected...

04:35.155 --> 04:38.056
we could wipe out
the enemy's entire war production.

04:38.124 --> 04:39.921
Boy, that sounds impressive.

04:39.993 --> 04:42.461
It's a shame it has to be developed
during wartime.

04:42.529 --> 04:46.761
His work could be so important
in promoting world peace and harmony.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.600
- Maj. Trevor?
- Yes, sir.

04:48.668 --> 04:51.000
We just got a call from Passport Control...

04:51.071 --> 04:52.766
at La Guardia Airport, New York.

04:52.839 --> 04:56.900
A man fitting the description of a major
enemy agent got through Customs.

04:56.977 --> 05:00.572
They believe it's the notorious
international mercenary, the Falcon.

05:00.647 --> 05:04.083
The Falcon?
How could he get through Customs?

05:04.284 --> 05:07.082
They tried to detain him,
but he had a neutral passport.

05:07.153 --> 05:10.281
Did they have time to put a tail
from Military Intelligence on him?

05:10.357 --> 05:13.349
Not enough time apparently.
He slipped by them, too.

05:13.426 --> 05:15.690
Pull the file on the Falcon,
will you, please?

05:15.762 --> 05:17.059
Yes, sir.

05:17.330 --> 05:20.163
Has Intelligence figured out yet
why he would be coming here?

05:20.233 --> 05:21.427
Not yet.

05:21.501 --> 05:24.834
Whatever it is, you can bet
that if a high-paid mercenary like him...

05:24.904 --> 05:26.565
tries to get into the country...

05:26.640 --> 05:29.632
he's after something important
and dangerous.

05:29.943 --> 05:33.174
The last report we had on the Falcon
was out of India.

05:33.246 --> 05:35.737
British Intelligence had evidence
that he kidnapped...

05:35.815 --> 05:38.113
a vice consul there two weeks ago...

05:38.184 --> 05:41.915
and a king's ransom in rubies
was exchanged for his return.

05:42.822 --> 05:45.154
Was he traveling alone?

05:45.291 --> 05:48.283
No, there was a woman with him.
Camilla Moret.

05:49.429 --> 05:53.092
Go to Central Intelligence and get me
everything you can on both of them.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.758
Yes, sir, right away.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.791
Dinner for the Professor, Sergeant.

06:28.868 --> 06:31.632
Let me check your pass.
I haven't seen you here before.

06:31.705 --> 06:33.536
Must be new in the mess hall.

06:35.008 --> 06:37.135
- Good night, Evans.
- Good night, sir.

06:37.210 --> 06:40.338
- What have you got there?
- Steak, French fries, and coffee.

06:40.413 --> 06:41.402
Steak?

06:42.949 --> 06:45.850
- I haven't tasted steak in two months.
- Neither have I.

06:45.919 --> 06:48.251
Too bad we're not more important
to the war effort.

06:48.321 --> 06:49.948
I think you can go on in now.

06:58.131 --> 07:00.599
Now, the integral between the limits...

07:00.667 --> 07:04.194
of X1 and X2 equals...

07:04.504 --> 07:05.971
Prof. Warren?

07:07.440 --> 07:10.170
- Is it dinnertime already?
- Yes, it is.

07:12.812 --> 07:15.872
You're much too preoccupied
with your research.

07:18.685 --> 07:21.347
Just leave the tray, please. Thank you.

07:22.655 --> 07:24.282
Now, let me see.

07:24.357 --> 07:28.726
The harmonic equation equals...

07:32.398 --> 07:35.799
I can see why your research
keeps you preoccupied, Professor.

07:35.869 --> 07:40.135
The conclusions you're drawing from your
geological surveys are fascinating.

07:41.074 --> 07:42.541
I beg your pardon?

07:42.609 --> 07:44.736
I said, your conclusions are fascinating.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.972
The study of the Earth's crust.

07:47.046 --> 07:50.982
How natural forces can manipulate it,
how man can manipulate it.

07:51.384 --> 07:53.045
Just who are you?

07:53.953 --> 07:56.979
I represent an interested party, Professor.

07:57.557 --> 08:00.492
A very interested and wealthy party.

08:01.828 --> 08:04.126
Give me that. And get out of here.

08:04.531 --> 08:08.160
Yes, of course.
But there is one thing I do want.

08:09.936 --> 08:12.302
I'll take the Pluto File, please.

08:13.406 --> 08:15.397
- The what?
- The Pluto File...

08:15.942 --> 08:19.343
in exchange for $1 million...

08:19.512 --> 08:22.845
in American currency or rare rubies.

08:23.616 --> 08:25.777
Take your choice, Professor.

08:25.885 --> 08:29.946
It's not for sale, at any price.
Neither am I.

08:30.290 --> 08:31.723
Now get out of here.

08:31.791 --> 08:34.783
Right. Then let's do this quietly,
Professor.

08:36.029 --> 08:37.291
Sergeant!

08:38.664 --> 08:39.756
Yes, sir?

09:16.703 --> 09:20.298
Diana went through all the papers.
The Pluto File is missing.

09:20.373 --> 09:23.342
The Professor's assistant, Charles Benson,
is on his way over...

09:23.409 --> 09:25.502
to see if anything else is gone.

09:25.578 --> 09:28.638
If Prof. Warren's experiments
can be deciphered...

09:29.249 --> 09:30.978
then whoever has that Pluto File...

09:31.050 --> 09:34.747
will soon be able to duplicate
a natural earthquake. Anywhere.

09:34.821 --> 09:37.517
It could disrupt our entire war effort.

09:38.024 --> 09:41.790
Whoever stole that file
knew exactly what he was looking for...

09:41.861 --> 09:45.854
and that could be a more potent weapon
than any of the hardware we have now.

09:46.099 --> 09:49.694
Yes, I understand.
Thank you very much, Doctor.

09:53.273 --> 09:54.604
Maj. Trevor.

09:54.874 --> 09:56.603
What's the report?

09:56.676 --> 10:00.476
The doctor said Prof. Warren will be fine,
but he's still under sedation.

10:00.546 --> 10:02.013
He's had quite a shock.

10:02.081 --> 10:06.177
He'll be staying at Walter Reed Hospital
a day or two for observation.

10:06.252 --> 10:09.278
Did the security detail at the hospital
check in with you?

10:09.355 --> 10:12.449
Yes, there's a Marine guard
posted outside the door of his room.

10:17.964 --> 10:22.526
It's an honor to be working with you.
The Falcon is a legend.

10:23.937 --> 10:25.700
Regrettably true.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.316
All right, back to Washington.

10:43.890 --> 10:46.120
Now that we've verified
the Pluto File is real...

10:46.192 --> 10:47.989
there's important work to be done.

10:48.061 --> 10:50.621
Prof. Warren could become a nuisance.

10:50.730 --> 10:54.632
Before we can proceed to our next step,
he must be eliminated.

11:08.081 --> 11:10.914
General, am I glad I found you.
This just came in.

11:10.984 --> 11:13.885
It concerns the all-points bulletin
put out on Camilla Moret.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.215
She's been found?

11:15.288 --> 11:18.382
She's in a hospital in New York.
In the isolation ward.

11:18.458 --> 11:19.823
What's wrong with her?

11:22.295 --> 11:23.660
What is it?

11:25.698 --> 11:27.495
She's got bubonic plague.

11:32.538 --> 11:34.267
All right, thank you.

11:36.209 --> 11:38.837
The Falcon's lady friend
is still in isolation.

11:38.911 --> 11:42.312
They'll tell us as soon as we can have
someone in New York question her.

11:42.382 --> 11:45.579
- That may not be for days.
- That's not much help.

11:46.319 --> 11:49.152
In any event, it looks as if
you have two assignments now:

11:49.222 --> 11:51.417
You have to find out
what the Falcon is up to...

11:51.491 --> 11:53.618
and we must get
those Pluto File papers back.

11:54.627 --> 11:56.492
At least we have a start.

11:56.796 --> 11:58.491
Maj. Trevor's office. Yes?

11:58.564 --> 12:01.624
The guard on duty at Warren's lab
had a scuffle with the thief.

12:01.701 --> 12:03.498
As the Professor's under sedation...

12:03.569 --> 12:06.094
we'll see if the guard
can describe the assailant.

12:06.172 --> 12:07.935
Excuse me, Maj. Trevor.

12:08.474 --> 12:13.343
That Marine guard, Sgt. Evans,
he is in the isolation ward at the hospital.

12:13.446 --> 12:15.380
- Isolation ward?
- Yes, sir.

12:17.483 --> 12:20.179
Tell Dr. Barnes we'll be at the hospital
as soon as we can.

12:20.353 --> 12:22.446
The sergeant who was
Prof. Warren's guard?

12:22.522 --> 12:25.548
He's been unconscious
ever since they brought him here.

12:25.625 --> 12:28.719
His pulse is irregular,
breathing is difficult and very hurried...

12:28.795 --> 12:30.990
40 to 60 respirations a minute.

12:31.230 --> 12:34.666
All the vital signs suggest
rapidly developing pneumonia.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.994
Apparently, you don't believe
it's pneumonia.

12:37.070 --> 12:40.699
The incubation is just too fast.
It could be very contagious.

12:42.075 --> 12:44.270
In fact, it could be the bubonic plague.

12:44.343 --> 12:46.504
The plague in 1942.

12:47.046 --> 12:49.014
I know it sounds unlikely...

12:49.082 --> 12:52.210
but the plague still pops up
every now and then.

12:52.485 --> 12:54.749
You are aware of a recent case
in New York City?

12:54.821 --> 12:56.846
- A woman named Moret.
- Yes.

12:57.090 --> 13:01.117
The last known case before that
was reported out of India two weeks ago.

13:01.194 --> 13:03.128
There may be more we don't know about...

13:03.196 --> 13:07.257
but we try to keep up with these things,
what with the war and all.

13:08.134 --> 13:10.796
What about Prof. Warren?
Is he gonna be all right?

13:10.870 --> 13:13.703
Mild shock, a contusion. Nothing serious.

13:14.006 --> 13:16.873
- Any plague symptoms?
- No, not one.

13:16.943 --> 13:21.141
Yet he did come in contact
with the same thief that Marine guard did.

13:21.414 --> 13:24.315
Do you think that's who
transmitted the plague?

13:24.383 --> 13:25.941
Diana may be right.

13:26.018 --> 13:28.851
But you said Prof. Warren
had no symptoms at all.

13:28.921 --> 13:32.857
Is it possible to come in contact with
a carrier but not pick it up immediately?

13:32.925 --> 13:35.792
Absolutely.
It hits some people overnight...

13:35.895 --> 13:39.387
other people walk around with it
for weeks before it lays them out.

13:39.465 --> 13:42.866
Steve, the last known case
occurred in India.

13:42.935 --> 13:45.961
Our information tells us
that the Falcon was there...

13:46.038 --> 13:47.835
at the same time.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.168
That's true.

13:49.509 --> 13:53.240
If that thief was the Falcon, we now know
his mission, or at least part of it.

13:53.312 --> 13:56.748
And if it is the Falcon,
he's carrying the bubonic plague...

13:56.816 --> 13:58.613
and doesn't know it.

13:58.851 --> 14:02.878
Doctor, is it possible that we can ask
Prof. Warren a few questions?

14:02.955 --> 14:05.321
He might be able to help us
identify that man.

14:05.391 --> 14:07.325
He was sleeping last time I checked...

14:07.393 --> 14:10.021
but the sedation should be wearing off
any time now.

14:10.096 --> 14:13.554
He's in Room 203 if you want to look in.

14:13.799 --> 14:17.860
I'll go. If he's up to any questions,
I'll let you know.

14:17.937 --> 14:19.063
Thank you, Doctor.

14:19.138 --> 14:21.572
One minute, Yeoman Prince.
Before you go...

14:21.641 --> 14:25.202
would you mind coming down
to my office for an inoculation?

14:25.278 --> 14:26.370
What?

14:26.979 --> 14:28.378
Ladies first.

14:29.315 --> 14:30.680
Thank you.

14:40.193 --> 14:43.856
Yeoman Prince, Military Intelligence.
I'll just be a moment.

14:49.902 --> 14:51.164
Professor.

15:13.826 --> 15:16.761
You have discovered
the hope of the ancients.

15:17.897 --> 15:20.525
Since time began,
man has sought that knowledge...

15:20.600 --> 15:23.228
the knowledge
to still the Earth's tremors...

15:23.302 --> 15:26.430
or to cause them to quake
with the energy of the sun.

16:34.140 --> 16:35.869
Here is the target.

16:36.542 --> 16:39.875
Near Bladensburg, Maryland,
15 miles from the Capitol.

16:39.945 --> 16:41.173
Very tidy.

16:42.081 --> 16:46.381
Benson, what do you estimate the radius
of the destructive force will be?

16:48.154 --> 16:50.918
Once the primary target
is caused to destruct...

16:50.990 --> 16:54.653
there shouldn't be a building left
standing within 25 miles.

16:55.461 --> 16:56.723
Here, see.

17:00.299 --> 17:03.996
If my calculations are correct...

17:04.369 --> 17:06.234
we should be able...

17:07.138 --> 17:09.039
to cause a fault...

17:11.077 --> 17:14.308
around this line.

17:15.314 --> 17:18.112
- Yes, go on.
- Around the primary target...

17:19.151 --> 17:21.381
at a distance of five miles...

17:22.488 --> 17:24.786
we should ring the perimeter...

17:25.257 --> 17:28.351
at five or six selected
locations in the hills.

17:28.961 --> 17:30.622
Ring the perimeter with?

17:30.696 --> 17:32.095
Explosives.

17:33.065 --> 17:34.794
Dynamite will do.

17:35.668 --> 17:37.260
Very good, Benson.

17:37.536 --> 17:41.063
You will be handsomely rewarded
for your indiscretion.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.474
Right now, your primary duty...

17:43.542 --> 17:47.842
is to maintain your innocence
and keep the good Professor's confidence.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.547
Frank, can you do your job?

17:49.615 --> 17:52.743
Just tell me how much dynamite you want
and where you want it.

17:52.818 --> 17:54.809
Quite a coup, gentlemen.

17:55.287 --> 17:57.187
Thanks to the Pluto Project...

17:57.256 --> 18:00.384
we are about to have
a devastating explosion...

18:00.760 --> 18:04.321
and induce the world's first
man-made earthquake.

18:12.638 --> 18:14.401
Thank you very much.

18:16.208 --> 18:19.575
That was Dr. Barnes.
The final lab results are back.

18:19.645 --> 18:22.671
Sgt. Evans definitely has
the bubonic plague.

18:24.049 --> 18:26.950
He's going to be all right,
but it's gonna take a while.

18:27.019 --> 18:28.987
That's good news for Sgt. Evans.

18:29.054 --> 18:32.751
We've got to find that thief before
he contaminates half of Washington.

18:32.825 --> 18:36.556
There's no doubt in my mind
the Falcon stole that Pluto File.

18:37.863 --> 18:40.855
How soon before we can check
his description with the Professor?

18:40.933 --> 18:44.699
The Professor's out of the hospital
and is on his way back to the lab...

18:44.770 --> 18:47.261
with increased military protection.

18:47.873 --> 18:51.070
I'm glad Wonder Woman was there
to stop that assassination attempt.

18:51.143 --> 18:53.634
Yeah, the Professor was lucky, all right.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.313
That had to be the work of the Falcon, too.

18:57.950 --> 19:00.942
Call Prof. Warren
and tell him we'll be right over.

19:01.020 --> 19:04.512
Ask him to try and remember every detail
of his encounter with the thief.

19:04.590 --> 19:08.651
Steve, there has to be a leak
somewhere about the Pluto Project.

19:09.195 --> 19:13.154
Perhaps we've overlooked something
in Benson's alibi.

19:15.401 --> 19:16.891
Charles Benson.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.807
We must maintain our schedule.
How long to Bladensburg?

19:23.876 --> 19:26.936
It's only 17.5 miles from here.
We'll be on time.

19:27.012 --> 19:28.604
Let's get started.

19:46.532 --> 19:48.693
I'm glad you're feeling better, Professor.

19:48.767 --> 19:52.828
Thank you for your concern.
I'm glad to be alive for many reasons.

19:53.072 --> 19:55.666
The bubonic plague, for heaven's sake...

19:56.075 --> 19:58.270
and Wonder Woman saving my life.

19:58.944 --> 20:00.912
Do you feel up to answering
a few questions?

20:00.980 --> 20:03.141
Of course, Major.
What do you want to know?

20:03.215 --> 20:06.275
The man that broke in,
can you tell us exactly how it happened?

20:06.352 --> 20:09.480
It happened so quickly. It was mealtime.

20:09.555 --> 20:12.319
He was dressed like an orderly
from the mess hall.

20:12.391 --> 20:15.451
Can you remember
any specific physical details?

20:15.794 --> 20:18.228
Did he seem physically healthy?

20:18.397 --> 20:21.332
Yes, he was an athletic man,
striking really.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.159
We were standing several feet apart.

20:24.236 --> 20:27.797
He was tall and distinguished,
with intelligent steel-blue eyes.

20:28.541 --> 20:32.705
In fact, there was something
very gentlemanly about him.

20:32.878 --> 20:36.314
Gentlemanly?
He nearly strangled you, Professor.

20:36.382 --> 20:40.944
That's the point. It's difficult to explain,
but still, there was something.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.612
No, not honorable.

20:42.688 --> 20:45.521
Maybe "professional"
is the word I'm looking for.

20:45.591 --> 20:47.616
He certainly knew
what he was looking for.

20:47.693 --> 20:51.094
He must have thought
that he had really strangled me.

20:51.797 --> 20:54.630
Because I remember
picking up the phone...

20:55.401 --> 20:59.667
and this arm around my neck
and then, suddenly, all went black.

21:00.639 --> 21:02.266
Charles, are you all right?

21:04.076 --> 21:06.806
I must be catching a cold, that's all.

21:08.814 --> 21:09.940
Let's not take any chances.

21:10.015 --> 21:12.347
Diana, call Dr. Barnes
and bring the staff car.

21:12.418 --> 21:14.113
Yes, sir, right away.

21:14.620 --> 21:15.780
Professor.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.757
All right, Mr. Benson,
I think you better go now.

21:22.828 --> 21:24.386
No, I can't.

21:24.830 --> 21:28.391
It wouldn't be fair to leave the Professor
with all this work.

21:28.467 --> 21:31.630
I'll see my own family doctor
when I have time. I'm fine.

21:31.704 --> 21:35.936
It'd be a lot fairer to Prof. Warren
to have you here in good health.

21:36.809 --> 21:38.538
The Professor has been inoculated.

21:38.611 --> 21:41.944
But you both may have been exposed
to bubonic plague.

21:43.882 --> 21:45.645
- Bubonic plague?
- That's right.

21:45.718 --> 21:47.777
You'll do yourself
and the Professor a favor...

21:47.853 --> 21:50.447
once you put yourself
in the hands of proper medical aid.

21:50.522 --> 21:53.184
- Come, I'll get you down to the car.
- No, I'll stay.

21:53.258 --> 21:56.352
Listen, we're tracking a man
infected with bubonic plague.

21:56.428 --> 21:57.827
You may have picked it up.

21:57.896 --> 22:00.456
But how?
Charles had no contact with the thief.

22:00.532 --> 22:01.965
Not during the robbery.

22:02.034 --> 22:05.435
But the thief you described
could easily be the man we're looking for.

22:09.041 --> 22:12.033
You have been in contact
with the Falcon, haven't you?

22:12.111 --> 22:13.373
Stop it.

22:14.513 --> 22:16.037
Don't make me use this.

22:16.115 --> 22:18.310
Give me the new keys
to the security system.

22:18.384 --> 22:20.579
Charles, please!
Think of what you're doing.

22:20.653 --> 22:21.711
Now!

22:30.295 --> 22:32.490
Guard, come in here!

22:34.800 --> 22:37.997
- Did he take the only key?
- Yes, it's a special new security lock.

22:38.070 --> 22:40.004
Try the phones.
Help me break down the door.

23:31.857 --> 23:33.916
You must now tell the truth.

23:34.393 --> 23:37.829
You are working with the Falcon.
And he's working for the Nazis.

23:37.896 --> 23:40.262
Yes, I am. He is.

23:40.332 --> 23:43.495
Where is the Falcon?
You know he's very dangerous.

23:44.103 --> 23:47.334
You must tell me, please!
Where is the Falcon?

24:06.558 --> 24:10.085
When he regains consciousness,
he'll tell you where the Falcon is...

24:10.162 --> 24:12.153
and what he plans to do.

24:12.498 --> 24:16.093
He could be in a coma for days.
By then it may be too late.

24:16.869 --> 24:19.360
Now we know the Falcon
stole the Pluto Files...

24:19.438 --> 24:20.769
and Charles helped him.

24:20.839 --> 24:24.331
It was the Falcon who attempted
to assassinate Prof. Warren.

24:25.444 --> 24:27.605
The Falcon is deadly enough.

24:27.679 --> 24:30.375
Now we know surely
he's carrying the plague.

24:30.449 --> 24:32.713
Apparently, he doesn't even know it.

24:44.797 --> 24:48.528
- How much farther to Bladensburg?
- It's only a few miles.

24:49.635 --> 24:51.865
But the gas tank's nearly empty.

24:53.539 --> 24:56.303
To assume, you didn't fill it up
before we started?

24:56.375 --> 24:58.275
Everything's rationed.

25:09.388 --> 25:10.855
What'll it be?

25:11.490 --> 25:13.390
I would like for you to fill it up.

25:13.458 --> 25:16.359
My friend tells me
we shall have to settle for 2 gallons.

25:16.428 --> 25:18.726
Yes, sir. You guys must be lost.

25:18.797 --> 25:22.096
We don't get many strangers
out here since the highway was finished.

25:22.167 --> 25:24.635
We'd appreciate a bit of haste,
if you don't mind.

25:24.703 --> 25:25.863
Yes, sir.

26:48.820 --> 26:51.618
It seems like
it's right in the middle of nowhere.

26:51.690 --> 26:54.989
Exactly. Precisely why
the Americans chose this spot...

26:55.060 --> 26:58.291
for one of their experimental
atomic reactor laboratories.

26:58.363 --> 27:00.331
If Benson's information is correct...

27:00.399 --> 27:03.232
it should be several miles
beyond that gate.

27:03.302 --> 27:06.135
- It certainly is well hidden.
- Yes, of course.

27:06.204 --> 27:09.139
The Pluto Project will blow it up.

27:11.109 --> 27:14.169
They've been working so hard
on developing atomic energy.

27:14.246 --> 27:16.942
It becomes a supreme irony, doesn't it?

27:17.049 --> 27:21.884
The first atomic explosion
will destroy Washington, D.C.

27:29.227 --> 27:30.990
Maj. Trevor's office.

27:32.764 --> 27:35.062
Yes. When?

27:37.936 --> 27:39.631
Thank you, Doctor.

27:43.241 --> 27:46.335
Steve, that was Dr. Barnes.

27:46.478 --> 27:48.946
Another case of bubonic plague
has been reported.

27:49.014 --> 27:50.003
Where?

27:50.082 --> 27:52.243
The patient's being taken to Walter Reed...

27:52.317 --> 27:54.478
so Dr. Barnes
can look after him personally.

27:54.586 --> 27:56.281
Where was the patient when he got sick?

27:56.355 --> 27:59.620
A small town not far from here.
Bladensburg, Maryland.

28:00.592 --> 28:03.959
Gen. Blankenship asked us to meet him
at a top-security installation...

28:04.029 --> 28:07.089
in that same area.
Any other information about the patient?

28:07.165 --> 28:10.396
No, just his name.
Robin Jensen. A teenager.

28:11.436 --> 28:14.928
Steve, we could stop by the hospital
on our way to meet the General.

28:15.007 --> 28:19.034
Good idea. If he can talk,
he can put us closer on the Falcon's trail.

28:33.325 --> 28:35.384
Hi, Bobby. How're you feeling?

28:36.728 --> 28:39.561
As if I got kicked in the chest by a mule.

28:40.365 --> 28:43.027
You're a strong young man.
They got you here early enough.

28:43.101 --> 28:44.466
You'll shake this thing.

28:44.536 --> 28:47.232
What you've got
is a highly infectious disease.

28:47.305 --> 28:49.796
We must know everyone
you've been in contact with...

28:49.875 --> 28:51.775
especially any strangers.

28:52.110 --> 28:54.578
A couple of guys
did come by this morning.

28:55.147 --> 28:57.115
Do you remember what they looked like?

28:57.182 --> 28:59.810
They were 30.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.889
The bigger guy looked like
maybe he was an athlete.

29:04.956 --> 29:06.821
He stayed in the car.

29:07.426 --> 29:10.452
The shorter guy, the driver...

29:13.365 --> 29:14.832
had dark hair.

29:15.233 --> 29:16.894
What kind of a car was it?

29:17.702 --> 29:19.135
A black coupe.

29:20.739 --> 29:22.070
All dusty.

29:24.076 --> 29:26.544
Did they say where they were going?

29:26.611 --> 29:29.079
Must have been
somewhere around Bladensburg.

29:29.748 --> 29:32.046
Thanks, Bobby, you've been a big help.

29:38.890 --> 29:42.621
Morning, Major, ma'am.
May I see your authorization, please?

29:46.932 --> 29:48.797
Thank you, Major. Proceed.

29:48.867 --> 29:52.667
It's not often you see a top-secret
security operation run as tightly as this.

29:52.737 --> 29:56.036
- This is the last checkpoint, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

29:56.908 --> 29:58.375
Open the gate.

30:19.598 --> 30:22.499
The boy was positive
they were heading toward Bladensburg?

30:22.567 --> 30:24.296
Yes, sir. We've just spoken with him.

30:24.369 --> 30:25.529
Excuse me.

30:25.604 --> 30:29.404
Is there any connection between
this installation and the Pluto Project?

30:29.474 --> 30:32.034
Could that be
why the Falcon is in this area?

30:32.644 --> 30:36.705
There is no relationship between the two
experimental projects, whatsoever.

30:36.781 --> 30:40.080
But if the Falcon
is trying to join the two...

30:41.253 --> 30:44.245
then a great many lives
could be in grave danger.

30:45.657 --> 30:49.684
What is the nature of this Project 741?
Why is it so important?

30:51.830 --> 30:54.890
Project 741 is a part
of The Manhattan Project.

30:55.600 --> 31:00.037
It is a stationary laboratory
with a cyclotron reactor.

31:00.906 --> 31:03.602
It fuses uranium and plutonium atoms.

31:04.142 --> 31:08.135
The result is a form of energy
we don't yet know how to control.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.406
We only know it's tremendous.

31:11.483 --> 31:13.678
If the Falcon is in the area...

31:13.852 --> 31:17.151
the guard around this site
should be increased immediately.

31:29.901 --> 31:33.769
That's the last batch.
According to Benson's chart, we're all set.

31:34.206 --> 31:36.800
Exactly five miles from that reactor...

31:36.875 --> 31:39.537
we sufficiently ringed
the perimeter with explosives...

31:39.611 --> 31:42.978
that should be just enough force
to squeeze the Earth's crusts...

31:43.048 --> 31:46.609
and shift the ground
between that cyclotron reactor.

31:46.918 --> 31:49.113
All right, strip those wires
and we're ready.

31:49.921 --> 31:53.721
These fuses aren't going to go
till we're more than 25 miles from here.

31:53.792 --> 31:56.625
They'll go one at a time. We'll be far away.

31:56.695 --> 31:59.789
We'll be well out of harm's way. Let's go.

32:03.301 --> 32:06.737
As you know, we've been working
on this project for over two years...

32:06.805 --> 32:09.467
and we're finally making
some significant headway.

32:09.541 --> 32:12.101
We've doubled the guard
around the site perimeter.

32:12.177 --> 32:15.112
- Very good, Steve.
- And we're activating the core...

32:15.180 --> 32:19.014
so we can't stop the experiment
for 24 hours. This way, please.

32:20.352 --> 32:23.378
The control rods
are set within the safety limits.

32:23.488 --> 32:26.980
All the walls are lead. The possible
energy force we're dealing with...

32:27.058 --> 32:30.789
has a potential of millions of tons of TNT.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.123
That's very impressive.

32:33.531 --> 32:36.830
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go up
to another level for a few moments.

32:36.901 --> 32:38.960
- You all right, Diana?
- Yes, I'm fine.

32:39.037 --> 32:42.632
I'm sure it's just a reaction
to that inoculation we all had.

32:43.008 --> 32:44.100
General.

32:46.645 --> 32:48.306
Well, that's that.

32:48.513 --> 32:50.845
Nothing can stop the pattern
once it's started.

32:50.915 --> 32:52.610
Then this whole place goes up.

32:52.684 --> 32:54.948
No, the whole county goes up. Come on.

33:13.471 --> 33:16.702
We can now duplicate
the sun's fusion of hydrogen nuclei.

33:16.775 --> 33:19.903
This takes place at a temperature
previously unknown to Earth...

33:19.978 --> 33:22.310
20 million degrees centigrade.

33:22.514 --> 33:23.640
That's incredible!

33:23.715 --> 33:28.118
1 pound of uranium 238
equals over 2 million tons of coal.

34:27.579 --> 34:31.071
- You have to shut the reactor core down.
- But that's impossible.

34:31.149 --> 34:33.208
A major enemy agent
is operating in this area.

34:33.284 --> 34:34.751
He's stolen the Pluto File.

34:34.819 --> 34:37.549
That's a top-secret project
on earthquake experiments.

34:49.734 --> 34:53.830
The reason we built the reactor here
is because this is not a fault area.

34:53.905 --> 34:56.998
The Pluto File has to do
with inducing man-made earthquakes.

34:57.074 --> 34:59.100
The Falcon has chosen his target well.

34:59.177 --> 35:03.113
This earthquake is intended
to make your reactor into a huge bomb.

35:09.154 --> 35:11.816
- Shut it down!
- I can't. Not for 24 hours.

35:14.058 --> 35:17.050
Sir, I have to order you to shut it down.

35:17.262 --> 35:19.492
I'm sorry, General. It's just not possible.

35:19.564 --> 35:22.658
You must have a failsafe plan
in case of an emergency.

35:22.734 --> 35:24.497
This is a Class One emergency.

35:24.569 --> 35:28.096
I'll have to get the President's
authorization to try cooling the core.

35:28.173 --> 35:31.734
The risk is very great. It's never been
tried under these circumstances.

35:31.810 --> 35:33.471
I'll call the President.

35:53.097 --> 35:55.691
According to Prof. Warren's Pluto File...

35:55.767 --> 35:57.962
now that we've got
the explosives started...

35:58.036 --> 36:01.836
the tremors should progress with
increasing force over the next eight hours.

36:01.906 --> 36:04.966
And there isn't anything
anyone can do about it.

36:05.777 --> 36:08.041
In point of fact, Frank, you're wrong.

36:08.112 --> 36:11.047
There is one person
who might be able to stop it...

36:11.115 --> 36:14.084
America's foremost seismologist,
Prof. Warren.

36:14.419 --> 36:16.250
He discovered
how to induce an earthquake.

36:16.321 --> 36:18.448
He may figure out how to stop one.

36:18.656 --> 36:20.317
What are you going to do?

36:20.391 --> 36:24.259
What I intended to do originally
before Wonder Woman interfered.

36:24.963 --> 36:26.988
Eliminate Prof. Warren.

36:38.276 --> 36:42.770
I have to find countermeasures
to stop these induced tremors.

36:43.214 --> 36:46.513
It's a part of the project
that I've barely investigated.

36:46.584 --> 36:50.350
I've already alerted Dr. Norris
and Maj. Trevor that I'm here with you.

36:50.421 --> 36:53.049
Is there anything I can do
to help stop these tremors?

36:53.124 --> 36:57.083
We'll need quotations from these tables
of square roots and logarithms.

36:57.662 --> 37:01.996
Let's see. "Hooke's laws.
The law of harmonic motion. "

37:06.004 --> 37:08.837
Wonder Woman, give me
the square root of potential energy.

37:08.907 --> 37:11.398
Of course, I was very good in school.

37:11.509 --> 37:14.740
Let's try, "E" equals half...

37:14.946 --> 37:18.882
KA squared, sine squared...

37:19.551 --> 37:21.712
- omega "T"...
- Extraordinary.

37:21.819 --> 37:24.310
Absolutely extraordinary.

37:24.489 --> 37:25.683
Thank you.

37:33.131 --> 37:35.361
No doubt they'll be expecting me.

37:36.367 --> 37:37.925
We'll wait here for a moment.

37:38.002 --> 37:40.937
See if there's any change
in the guard's routine.

37:41.172 --> 37:44.073
- How long?
- We should know soon.

37:48.880 --> 37:51.508
When the President authorized
the Manhattan Project...

37:51.583 --> 37:53.915
he thought it would be
a fast way to end the war.

37:53.985 --> 37:56.715
Now you're telling us
it's a fast way to end Washington.

37:56.788 --> 37:57.948
It's the fastest.

37:58.022 --> 38:00.115
I've got my men combing the area.

38:00.191 --> 38:02.955
We tried to stop the explosions
that start the tremors...

38:03.027 --> 38:04.722
but the earthquake's already begun.

38:04.796 --> 38:07.731
Dr. Norris must be given permission
to cool the reactor down.

38:07.799 --> 38:09.528
It's a method we haven't used.

38:09.601 --> 38:12.229
If it stabilizes the temperature, fine.

38:12.904 --> 38:14.269
If it doesn't...

38:16.674 --> 38:17.971
Very well.

38:18.977 --> 38:21.878
- All right, Dr. Norris, go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

38:23.114 --> 38:27.483
What other suggestions would you
have me carry back to the President?

38:27.619 --> 38:30.417
Evacuate Washington... fast.

38:30.655 --> 38:32.452
That is just not possible!

38:32.523 --> 38:34.787
Then get out as many people as you can.

38:34.859 --> 38:39.228
I'm sorry. I just can't believe
that this is as serious as you say it is.

38:39.631 --> 38:41.394
Man-made earthquake!

38:54.479 --> 38:56.572
Now how do you feel, Mr. Porter?

38:57.348 --> 39:00.249
I'm afraid you've made a believer
out of me.

39:00.551 --> 39:05.147
If it is man-made, then there must be
a man-made way to stop it.

39:05.223 --> 39:07.783
Prof. Warren's working on it now
with Wonder Woman.

39:07.892 --> 39:10.725
And we dispatched additional troops
to guard Prof. Warren.

39:10.795 --> 39:14.993
Very good. Then he's our only hope.
We can't evacuate in time.

39:15.633 --> 39:19.000
The lives of everyone in Washington
are in his hands.

39:25.076 --> 39:28.102
All right, men, off the truck.
Let's go. Move them out.

39:34.619 --> 39:37.588
- More guards.
- Yes, just as I said.

39:37.989 --> 39:42.949
Now they realize how important
Prof. Warren is to our plan.

39:43.361 --> 39:45.761
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

39:45.897 --> 39:47.888
All right, let's get to work quickly.

40:19.363 --> 40:23.891
All right. When that guard gets
to the back of the institute building...

40:23.968 --> 40:27.199
you head for those bushes.
You'll have 20 seconds, plenty of time.

40:27.271 --> 40:28.363
I can make it.

40:28.439 --> 40:31.135
When you're in those bushes
you await your best chance.

40:31.209 --> 40:35.407
Run towards that fence where that gate is.
And make sure they see you.

40:35.580 --> 40:40.074
Yes, that should be enough of a diversion
to let me get to that rear door.

40:40.251 --> 40:42.151
Then once I'm inside...

40:42.620 --> 40:46.317
I'll be able to finish our business
with the good Professor.

40:50.695 --> 40:51.753
Now.

41:01.773 --> 41:03.570
Halt! Who goes there?

41:05.910 --> 41:07.502
Corporal of the Guard!

41:07.812 --> 41:10.144
I'd better go see what that's about.

41:39.677 --> 41:41.008
Stay back.

41:47.051 --> 41:49.884
Put the gun down.
There's no way to escape.

41:49.954 --> 41:51.387
We don't want to hurt you.

41:58.362 --> 41:59.989
Please stay back.

42:11.108 --> 42:13.599
Call an ambulance, but don't get near him.

42:13.678 --> 42:16.670
Seal off the street
and cover the back fence.

42:17.048 --> 42:20.108
I have a feeling he might have a partner
around here someplace.

42:20.184 --> 42:21.583
Go, quickly.

42:49.180 --> 42:52.343
- What was that all about?
- They caught a man in the rear area.

42:52.416 --> 42:55.681
He had a gun and I believe
he's working with the Falcon.

42:55.753 --> 42:58.779
But even if he's not,
the Falcon is still on the loose.

42:58.856 --> 43:01.916
I won't leave your side
from now on, Professor.

43:03.027 --> 43:04.654
Are you making any progress?

43:04.729 --> 43:07.789
Some, with your help.
But I haven't got the answer yet.

43:07.865 --> 43:10.197
Keep trying. I'm sure
you'll find a solution.

43:10.268 --> 43:14.364
By now that reactor core
is beyond the limit of a safe temperature.

43:21.345 --> 43:24.781
The temperature readings are critical.
382, and rising.

43:24.849 --> 43:27.044
The special coolant isn't working properly.

43:27.118 --> 43:30.747
- That's up 54 in the last 15 minutes.
- I know.

43:32.189 --> 43:34.623
At 400, we should get out of here.

43:35.593 --> 43:37.220
Where are we gonna go?

43:37.295 --> 43:40.731
We'd have to travel 25 miles
in the next few minutes.

43:44.001 --> 43:45.400
It's no use.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.673
Integral calculus is always problematical.

43:55.980 --> 43:59.814
By taking this term
and substituting that for "A"...

44:00.251 --> 44:03.550
and this term
and substituting that for "K"...

44:03.988 --> 44:07.754
putting those into
our original energy equation, perhaps...

44:07.825 --> 44:10.521
Magnificent. Simplicity itself.

44:11.028 --> 44:13.963
You have an extraordinary mind,
Wonder Woman.

44:15.032 --> 44:19.162
More chalk. It's in the storeroom.
Second shelf. Any color will do.

44:40.391 --> 44:42.359
Good evening, Professor.

44:46.464 --> 44:48.091
You've come back.

44:48.733 --> 44:51.167
What for? Haven't you done enough?

44:51.402 --> 44:54.565
Not quite. You see, Prof. Warren...

44:55.239 --> 44:56.900
I hate loose ends.

44:57.408 --> 45:00.309
And I'm very much afraid
you're a loose end.

45:00.611 --> 45:05.048
- And you as well, Wonder Woman.
- You know that's useless, Falcon.

45:05.316 --> 45:08.843
- Your game is over.
- No, I don't think so.

45:08.986 --> 45:11.511
Don't you care about the lives
you've put in danger?

45:11.589 --> 45:15.081
Are you so cold, so professional?

45:15.192 --> 45:17.717
Yes, I am indeed a professional.

45:18.729 --> 45:22.256
I learned at a very early age
to depend only upon myself.

45:23.567 --> 45:28.163
Don't you realize you may be responsible
for the destruction of an entire city?

45:28.239 --> 45:31.174
This man has
no sense of morality, Professor.

45:31.242 --> 45:34.939
Obviously, he has so little regard
for other people's lives...

45:35.012 --> 45:37.503
that he must hate himself very much.

45:37.681 --> 45:40.047
'Course I could remind you
that there's a war.

45:40.117 --> 45:42.915
And I will not argue morality with you,
Wonder Woman.

45:42.987 --> 45:45.615
I am interested in doing my job properly...

45:45.689 --> 45:48.886
and, as I said, without loose ends.

45:50.061 --> 45:53.121
Listen to me, Falcon.
Your own life is in danger.

45:53.197 --> 45:56.098
If you don't let us help you, you will die.

45:57.902 --> 45:59.870
You have bubonic plague.

46:00.438 --> 46:04.772
- You expect me to believe that?
- Two weeks ago, you were in India.

46:05.409 --> 46:07.240
Yes, perhaps.

46:07.311 --> 46:11.611
There was an outbreak of the plague
in India exactly then. You're a carrier.

46:11.682 --> 46:14.651
You've already infected three people so far
that we know of...

46:14.718 --> 46:16.583
including Camilla Moret.

46:16.654 --> 46:18.679
- Camilla?
- Yes.

46:19.723 --> 46:23.887
All right, very well.
Perhaps this is useless against you.

46:25.930 --> 46:28.057
But these chemicals are not!

46:45.916 --> 46:48.009
- Water, please.
- On the way.

46:54.191 --> 46:55.920
- Thank you.
- That's it.

46:56.060 --> 46:59.120
The simplest possible answer.
And just in time.

47:03.234 --> 47:06.328
Dr. Norris? Professor Otis Warren.

47:07.872 --> 47:12.036
The effective countermeasure
is to flood water within the reactor core...

47:12.109 --> 47:13.736
not your special coolant.

47:13.811 --> 47:14.971
Thank you.

47:17.047 --> 47:20.744
- Remarkable man, Prof. Warren.
- Yes, he is.

47:21.685 --> 47:23.152
And you, too, Wonder Woman.

47:23.220 --> 47:27.884
Yes, I'm a seismologist,
not a nuclear scientist, but this I know.

47:28.058 --> 47:32.290
Replace the coolant with the flow of water
and the reactor will cool.

47:32.496 --> 47:36.193
Isn't it is a pity
we aren't all on the same side?

47:37.701 --> 47:40.636
Well, it's never too late to change, Falcon.

47:41.272 --> 47:46.232
The tremors will pass. They'll peak at 4.2
and subside within three hours.

47:48.245 --> 47:51.510
Trust me, I know a little something
about chemistry, too.

47:51.582 --> 47:53.914
It's our only chance. Good luck!

47:56.887 --> 47:59.879
- Is everything gonna be all right?
- It's fine.

48:00.224 --> 48:03.785
It's fine for those nuclear whiz kids.
But, for myself...

48:05.396 --> 48:08.854
one day I'd like to discover
how to stop an earthquake.

48:16.974 --> 48:21.035
Dr. Barnes just brought me up-to-date
on his roster of bubonic plague patients.

48:21.111 --> 48:23.579
They're all responding to the antibiotics.

48:23.647 --> 48:28.016
Camilla Moret in New York,
the Marine guards, Sgt. Evans and Bobby.

48:28.085 --> 48:29.746
They're all going to be fine.

48:29.820 --> 48:32.983
- Good. How about Benson and Willis?
- They're gonna be fine, too.

48:33.057 --> 48:35.048
- And the Falcon?
- He pulled through.

48:35.125 --> 48:38.390
But I'm sure Uncle Sam
is gonna have plans for him.

48:38.462 --> 48:40.062
What are they gonna do to him?

48:40.063 --> 48:42.262
I'm afraid his
professional career is over.

48:42.333 --> 48:45.598
When he does recover,
he'll be interned for the rest of the war.

48:45.669 --> 48:47.864
You know, he's lucky to be alive.

48:47.938 --> 48:52.307
- That man must be stronger than a bull.
- He's also very clever and intelligent.

48:52.376 --> 48:55.243
It's a shame he chose to lead
such a destructive life.

48:55.312 --> 48:57.473
But at least he'll have time to think.

48:57.548 --> 49:00.449
Perhaps he'll find a more useful way
to direct his energies.

49:00.517 --> 49:03.782
That's the kind of positive thinking
Wonder Woman would have, Diana.

49:03.854 --> 49:05.617
- Good thinking.
- Thank you.

49:05.689 --> 49:09.090
I'm glad you and Wonder Woman approve.
