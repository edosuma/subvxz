02:46.620 --> 02:48.578
<i>When I was still just a kid,</i>

02:49.040 --> 02:51.328
<i>I remember my father telling me</i>

02:51.709 --> 02:53.369
<i>what he thought that it took
for a man to be happy.</i>

02:55.087 --> 02:58.124
Tommy, finally! Come on, man,
New Year's is tonight.

02:58.299 --> 03:00.921
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry. I covered for you.

03:01.052 --> 03:01.821
Thanks, Hank.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.836
What, did you stay out
till they hung the last dog?

03:03.837 --> 03:05.072
- Yeah.
- Ha!

03:05.307 --> 03:07.016
<i>Simple things, really...</i>

03:08.519 --> 03:09.801
<i>A wife he loves,</i>

03:11.147 --> 03:12.892
<i>a decent job,</i>

03:14.902 --> 03:17.061
<i>friends and neighbors
who like and respect him.</i>

03:18.030 --> 03:19.739
<i>And for a while there,</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:23.026
<i>without hardly even realizing it,</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:25.536
<i>I had all that.</i>

03:27.041 --> 03:28.784
<i>I was a happy man.</i>

03:29.877 --> 03:31.040
Hey, tom.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.421
Remember we talked about
me getting off early today?

03:42.602 --> 03:43.645
Hey, Hank!

03:44.727 --> 03:45.890
Hey, Happy New Year, Schmitt!

03:49.732 --> 03:51.275
- Hey, Linda, Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

03:51.443 --> 03:53.151
- Hey, where you guys going?
- Sledding!

03:53.362 --> 03:55.355
- Hey, can I come?
- No!

03:55.633 --> 03:57.184
Ohh... Please! Ohh!

04:06.251 --> 04:08.707
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, happy new year, Hank.

04:08.879 --> 04:11.086
You gotta start charging people for that.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.333
Ha ha ha! Yeah, it'd pay better
than the county does.

04:32.197 --> 04:33.656
Honey, it's me.

04:38.288 --> 04:41.031
- How you feelin' today?
- Hey. Good.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.995
- Oh, my gosh.
- He was sure kickin' a lot today.

04:57.932 --> 04:59.293
Uh-oh...

05:00.896 --> 05:04.063
Looks like it's gonna be
a long afternoon for you.

05:04.233 --> 05:05.858
He brought Lou along.

05:06.569 --> 05:07.351
Oh, great.

05:07.529 --> 05:10.549
Yeah. I'll just be lyin' here, relaxing.

05:10.550 --> 05:12.566
- Oh...
- Ha ha ha!

05:16.247 --> 05:17.278
Hey, Jacob!

05:25.092 --> 05:26.439
Ha ha ha!

05:29.588 --> 05:31.147
What's he doing here?

05:31.322 --> 05:33.348
He needed a ride home.

05:33.442 --> 05:34.555
Little out of the way, isn't it?

05:35.386 --> 05:38.355
We can drop him off when we're done,
you know. It's no big deal, Hank.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.000
What's the big deal, Hank?

05:42.169 --> 05:46.084
Hey, you know, you need to shovel this shit
off of your, uh... whatcha-call-it deal there.

05:46.257 --> 05:48.165
I'll pay you a quarter to do it.

05:48.218 --> 05:50.249
Huh! I could use it.

05:50.703 --> 05:52.585
Ha ha! Look at Lou.

05:59.105 --> 06:00.433
Here, hold this, will you?

06:00.606 --> 06:03.100
- Wanna put it back there?
- No, no, it's gonna wilt.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.692
Hank, say hi to...
You didn't say hi to Mary Beth.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.605
Oh, yeah.
Hi, Mary Beth!

06:06.947 --> 06:09.520
He said hi, Mary Beth.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.716
Hank said hi.
Hi, Lou.

06:09.924 --> 06:10.967
Come here.

06:48.285 --> 06:49.613
Somebody else was here.

06:50.538 --> 06:52.079
Oh, I brought those.

06:53.582 --> 06:54.614
When?

06:55.273 --> 06:57.671
Well... What the hell do you think, Hank?

06:57.672 --> 07:00.545
This is the only day we can come here?

07:01.049 --> 07:02.876
What the hell's wrong with you?

07:04.136 --> 07:07.969
Hey, Jacob! Look!
I'm writing my name!

07:08.141 --> 07:11.640
Hang on a second!
Let me get Mrs. Johnson out here!

07:11.811 --> 07:13.270
I'll help you out.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.150
You know what the guy says?

07:38.325 --> 07:41.580
Says it's the crock pot
or, uh, crock box?

07:41.670 --> 07:48.082
No, no. Pay attention now...
Oh, no, that's the preacher, see?

07:45.792 --> 07:48.330
- This is the cowboy.
- Yeah, he says "moo."

07:48.962 --> 07:52.421
No, no. It's the guy standing
by the road. He says:

07:52.516 --> 07:55.449
"Why, officer? It's just a pine apple."

07:55.450 --> 07:57.006
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

07:57.313 --> 07:58.712
- You get it?
- Yeah.

07:59.682 --> 08:02.139
Well, Mr. accountant doesn't get it.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.061
Ha ha ha ha...

08:03.895 --> 08:04.937
Look out!

08:05.875 --> 08:06.918
Shit!

08:09.211 --> 08:10.462
You ok, baby?

08:11.153 --> 08:12.185
Go on, get out!

08:13.364 --> 08:15.073
Look at that, man!

08:15.909 --> 08:17.107
My truck.

08:18.788 --> 08:19.950
Come on, get out.

08:20.914 --> 08:21.614
Mary Beth!

08:25.754 --> 08:28.244
- She's gonna come back.
- Hey, what are you doing?

08:28.423 --> 08:30.665
- It's a nature preserve, you know that.
- So what?

08:30.842 --> 08:33.714
So you can't hunt here.
Come on, put the gun back.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.465
But it... but it messed up my truck.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.400
- So what? Come on.
- Hey, hey, Hank...

08:38.684 --> 08:42.843
It's not like we're huntin' here, uh-uh.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.648
- We're collectin' the dead.
- That's right.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.024
We're collecting the dead.

09:06.050 --> 09:08.544
- Just look at him...
- He runs like my wife.

09:08.718 --> 09:12.204
Hey, come on, wait up!
Come on, I'm not dressed for this shit!

09:27.399 --> 09:28.546
Mary Beth!

09:30.869 --> 09:32.529
Jesus! Look at all them birds!

09:32.787 --> 09:36.655
Those things are always waitin' on
something to die so they can eat it, right?

09:37.293 --> 09:39.499
What a weird job.

09:57.231 --> 09:59.106
Wish we had something to drink.

10:01.195 --> 10:02.986
Always be prepared.

10:03.155 --> 10:05.942
Oh, that's a good idea.
Let's all start drinking now.

10:06.117 --> 10:08.074
See there?
See how he is?

10:11.348 --> 10:13.906
Wonk! Dit-dit...
Like that guy, huh?

10:14.243 --> 10:16.006
Remember? Wonk! Dit-dit.
- Uh-huh.

10:16.545 --> 10:18.372
- You want some?
- I'm not thirsty.

10:18.548 --> 10:20.670
What, you don't drink till after 5:00?

10:20.775 --> 10:22.130
After 5:00, heh heh.

10:22.594 --> 10:24.407
Or maybe you just don't wanna share.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.710
You're afraid you'll catch
something from us, huh?

10:26.820 --> 10:27.872
Yeah...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.493
Hey, Hank!

10:29.502 --> 10:32.724
Hey! Come on, what are you doing?
Quit jackin' around.

10:33.147 --> 10:34.613
Now, you see...

10:34.614 --> 10:38.005
That's what you might call
an "insinuating" throw.

10:38.361 --> 10:39.357
Remember?

10:40.280 --> 10:43.566
You said that to me last time I saw you.

10:44.159 --> 10:47.493
Could've just said "hint".
But no, you had to put on airs.

10:48.122 --> 10:50.329
Show us all them fancy words you know.

10:50.470 --> 10:53.328
What, do you sit around,
you think about this stuff?

10:53.370 --> 10:55.239
When was that, two months ago?

10:56.590 --> 10:58.215
Kiss my ass.

11:00.553 --> 11:01.502
What the hell is it?

11:12.652 --> 11:15.731
- Jesus Christ.
- Shit, that's a airplane.

11:18.448 --> 11:22.779
You know what, it's probably
one of those drunk doctors.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.386
They're always crashing
their plane, you know?

11:23.922 --> 11:27.113
Yeah, it must've come down right there.
See all them broken trees, Jake?

11:27.292 --> 11:28.620
It's too dark. I can't see.

11:29.377 --> 11:31.833
Scrape some of that snow
off the windshield!

11:33.215 --> 11:35.753
Can't see a damn thing.

11:37.845 --> 11:39.043
Door's stuck.

11:39.221 --> 11:41.096
Probably a singer or something.

11:53.028 --> 11:54.773
Still can't see nothin' here.

11:57.223 --> 11:59.982
Still can't see anything.
Can't see a damn thing.

12:00.036 --> 12:01.579
I see the pilot!

12:03.774 --> 12:05.233
What's he talking about?

12:06.460 --> 12:07.540
Said somebody's in there.

12:10.089 --> 12:11.372
Are you ok?

12:14.303 --> 12:15.554
Hey. Hey, buddy...

12:16.388 --> 12:17.535
Aah! Whoaaa...

12:19.724 --> 12:20.871
Ah! Aah! Aah!

12:20.975 --> 12:22.226
Hey, get... get off!

12:23.164 --> 12:24.728
What the hell is going on...?

12:25.562 --> 12:26.709
Aah! Ohh!

12:27.647 --> 12:28.688
Oh, God!

12:28.689 --> 12:29.732
Shit!

12:30.946 --> 12:32.524
Hey, lemme outta here.

12:37.545 --> 12:40.698
- Good grief, Hank.
- Let me get this off of him. Here...

12:46.131 --> 12:48.923
Hank, did you... did you...
Did you see all them birds?

12:51.302 --> 12:53.130
Did I "see the birds"?!

12:54.056 --> 12:55.800
Come on, help me get outta here.

13:02.274 --> 13:04.816
- Hank, put that on your eye.
- Thanks.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.518
- You tore your coat, you know.
- Oh, my God!

13:08.030 --> 13:09.608
Oh, my God! Look at this!

13:10.953 --> 13:12.289
Shit!

13:12.590 --> 13:14.244
Oh, my God!

13:14.245 --> 13:15.409
How much you think is in here?

13:15.622 --> 13:19.371
God almighty! These are $100 bills!
The whole bag's full of 'em!

13:20.669 --> 13:22.413
Is this... is it real money, Lou?

13:22.589 --> 13:25.423
Oh, hell, yes, it's real.
Don't be stupid.

13:25.676 --> 13:28.002
Why would somebody be flying
around with this kind of cash?

13:28.178 --> 13:30.586
You know what? I bet
it's drug money.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.552
That's probably
I bet you're what it is. Right.

13:31.553 --> 13:33.216
This guy's a dope dealer

13:32.386 --> 13:33.220
because that's what they do.

13:33.392 --> 13:35.931
They fly around in
these little planes.

13:36.104 --> 13:38.310
- I guaran-damn-tee you, this is dirty money.
- That's right. I saw it on 20/20.

13:39.065 --> 13:41.734
"Dirty money"? What do you mean?
Are you telling me it's counterfeit?

13:41.735 --> 13:45.000
Oh, no.
No, this is real.

13:45.155 --> 13:48.192
Whatever it is, it's a police matter now.
What do you think we should do?

13:48.367 --> 13:50.241
Somebody should stay here,
somebody should go after the cops?

13:49.901 --> 13:52.701
- How you wanna Work it?
- What? Let's think this through.

13:52.850 --> 13:55.383
- What?
- Hold on!

13:56.544 --> 13:57.788
What if we didn't turn it in?

14:02.550 --> 14:03.926
You wanna keep it?

14:04.850 --> 14:08.000
Ha ha ha! He wants to keep it...
Well, that's a hot one!

14:08.120 --> 14:09.329
Why wouldn't we?

14:09.400 --> 14:10.713
- Why wouldn't we?
- Yeah.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.358
- Because we'd go to prison!
- Why?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.015
Why? Because it's stealing.

14:14.313 --> 14:15.973
"Stealing"...
Stealing from who?

14:16.148 --> 14:18.880
From him? Hell, he won't mind!

14:18.881 --> 14:19.871
Ha ha ha...

14:20.571 --> 14:22.309
Oh, 'cause he's dead, right?

14:23.385 --> 14:25.698
Ha ha! That's pretty funny...
He's dead, he won't mind.

14:26.368 --> 14:29.951
I say we take this bag back to the truck,
and we pretend like we were never here.

14:30.122 --> 14:31.036
Fuck yeah. Why not?

14:31.207 --> 14:33.034
Why not? Because we'd get caught.

14:33.376 --> 14:36.461
Aw, hell! I'll tell you what.
Stay the hell out of it then.

14:36.630 --> 14:40.544
You know, we don't need you.
It'd just be more money for us.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.252
Hey, I don't wanna stump you
another fancy word, Lou,

14:43.300 --> 14:45.297
but does the term "accomplice"
mean anything to you?

14:45.373 --> 14:46.467
Come on, that's stupid!

14:46.766 --> 14:49.258
But, Hank...
Why would we get caught?

14:49.436 --> 14:52.436
Because it's a lot of money, Jacob.
Somebody's bound to be looking for it.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.988
When they find that plane
and the money's not in it...

14:54.066 --> 14:55.624
- Bullshit!
- No, it's not bullshit!

14:55.700 --> 14:58.152
- They'll come looking for us.
- Bullshit! This is dirty money!

14:58.071 --> 15:01.238
And as far as that guy's concerned,
the cops don't even know he exists.

15:01.408 --> 15:04.195
Nobody knows about this...

15:02.875 --> 15:04.334
...but us.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.235
See there?

15:05.413 --> 15:08.663
Nobody knows but us.
It's like we came out here on a hike,

15:08.833 --> 15:11.205
and found lost treasure, right?

15:11.377 --> 15:13.703
It's the American dream
in a goddamn gym bag.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.550
He... he just wants
to walk away from it.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.044
You work for the American dream.
You don't steal it.

15:19.679 --> 15:21.802
Then this is even better.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.392
If this guy's a dope dealer, then...
like we're talkin' about...

15:27.413 --> 15:29.082
then that means we're like Robin hood.

15:29.150 --> 15:32.021
Oh, yeah, and I'll tell you what...
You got a beautiful wife at home.

15:32.193 --> 15:33.984
You're about to have a baby.

15:34.153 --> 15:36.442
I know you ain't pullin' down
that much at the feed mill.

15:37.198 --> 15:39.405
Wouldn't you love to have a piece of this?

15:39.576 --> 15:42.661
Hell, yes, I would.
But we can't just take it.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.367
Hey, what if there's a reward?
Maybe there's a reward, and they'll give...

15:45.625 --> 15:47.368
Maybe there's not!

15:48.002 --> 15:49.445
How about this...
I tell you what...

15:49.500 --> 15:52.307
I'll bet you $10,000...
just one of these packets, ...

15:52.355 --> 15:54.489
that when they find this plane, ...

15:55.594 --> 15:58.002
there's no mention of this money.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.991
Hank, why... why turn it in until we know
whether or not somebody's lookin' for it?

16:18.370 --> 16:19.484
That's right.

16:21.165 --> 16:23.739
If you scratch, then don't... don't itch.
If you... if it's...

16:24.035 --> 16:27.275
If it's broken, don't fix it.
Right?

16:27.392 --> 16:29.260
Or if you... if... if...
if the... if... if... if...

16:31.092 --> 16:32.634
And I know what you mean.

16:47.027 --> 16:49.352
Suppose I was the one to keep it?

16:51.407 --> 16:52.522
For how long?

16:52.700 --> 16:55.026
Just till spring, till they find the plane.

16:56.871 --> 16:57.951
Then what?

16:58.374 --> 17:00.000
Then, if you're right and
nobody mentions the money,

17:00.010 --> 17:02.075
we split it up, and we all leave town.

17:04.130 --> 17:05.957
Why should you get to hold it?

17:07.091 --> 17:09.927
That's the only way I'll do it.
Otherwise we can just turn it in right now.

17:09.955 --> 17:11.519
So, what, you mean...
You... you...

17:12.180 --> 17:15.799
You don't trust us?
Is that what you mean?

17:17.061 --> 17:19.184
That's a lot of money.
I guess I don't.

17:19.355 --> 17:20.834
Look, no... no promises.

17:20.835 --> 17:22.950
If somebody comes searching
for the money, I'll burn it.

17:22.913 --> 17:25.491
- Hank...
- No, that's the only way I'll do this!

17:25.510 --> 17:27.655
Look, we gotta be agreed on this.

17:27.906 --> 17:30.073
That's the deal.
That's the deal.

17:30.243 --> 17:32.504
I hold onto it,
we wait till they find the plane.

17:32.679 --> 17:35.286
If nobody mentions it,
we split it up, and we move away.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.225
OK?

17:36.541 --> 17:37.786
I'm in.

17:40.337 --> 17:41.416
We count it first.

17:45.135 --> 17:46.878
That's probably a good idea.

17:48.847 --> 17:50.222
I mean, you know...

17:51.030 --> 17:52.281
Heh heh heh...

17:52.906 --> 17:54.262
- Heh heh...
- Heh heh...

17:55.813 --> 17:58.437
This is nuts! Oh, my God!

17:59.567 --> 18:02.237
Hey, what you gonna buy, Jakey boy?

18:02.821 --> 18:04.196
I'm gonna buy me a truck.

18:04.614 --> 18:07.818
No, fuck that!
Get something classy... Trans Am!

18:07.993 --> 18:10.449
Oh, yeah, in my wildest
fuckin' dreams, a Trans Am.

18:10.521 --> 18:13.698
- You could buy a fleet of Trans Ams!
- Mary Beth!

18:13.961 --> 18:17.040
Where you been, huh?

18:36.818 --> 18:38.976
4,380,000...

18:39.153 --> 18:41.858
4,390,000...

18:42.031 --> 18:44.926
$4,400,000!

18:44.927 --> 18:47.295
Isn't that great?
Listen to that.

18:47.305 --> 18:50.790
Look at that shit, man.
Look how square it is.

18:50.959 --> 18:53.331
That is cool, huh?
How much is that apiece?

18:53.503 --> 18:54.914
About a million and...

18:55.338 --> 18:57.000
- A million and a half?
- Shh!

18:57.050 --> 18:58.000
- Shh!
- What?

18:58.087 --> 18:59.414
You hear that?

18:59.415 --> 19:00.553
Uh-uh.

19:12.953 --> 19:14.283
Oh, shit!

19:15.152 --> 19:17.561
Get in the truck, I'll handle this.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.482
Go on! Let's go!
Come on, cover up the money!

19:19.657 --> 19:22.279
Jake, get in the truck!
Dummy up! Let's go!

19:22.561 --> 19:23.708
Come on!

19:35.259 --> 19:36.338
Hey, Carl.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.257
- Engine trouble, Hank?
- Oh, I wish. Dog trouble.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.673
Jacob's mutt chased
a fox into the woods.

19:41.849 --> 19:42.763
She tree it?

19:42.934 --> 19:46.054
We thought so, but just when we went
after it, she came running back.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.390
What'd you do to your head there?

19:49.391 --> 19:53.690
Oh. God, uh...
Ran into a tree branch.

19:55.323 --> 19:59.232
- Your brother still out of work?
- Yeah.

19:59.461 --> 20:01.155
- Lou?
- Yeah, him, too.

20:01.789 --> 20:03.496
That's a shame, ain't it?

20:04.291 --> 20:06.331
Well, we probably better be heading back...

20:08.138 --> 20:10.795
- Hey, hello, Jacob!
- Hey, Carl, how you doin'?

20:10.965 --> 20:12.294
Good, good.

20:12.417 --> 20:15.056
I was beginning to think
you were trying to avoid me.

20:15.271 --> 20:16.716
I'm sorry?

20:16.889 --> 20:18.965
Well, you sittin' over there in that truck.

20:19.141 --> 20:20.849
I thought you was trying to avoid me.

20:21.018 --> 20:23.018
No, I was just sittin' in the truck.

20:23.115 --> 20:26.258
It's a little cold out here, you know.
Just keepin' warm.

20:26.817 --> 20:28.800
Well, we probably better be...

20:28.900 --> 20:31.195
Did you tell him about the plane?

20:31.196 --> 20:33.189
- It sou-sounded like a plane.
- What plane?

20:37.704 --> 20:39.247
What, you heard a plane?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.949
I don't know what he heard.
You know he's always hearing shit.

20:43.127 --> 20:45.249
Maybe you better tell me, Jacob.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.663
No, that's OK.
We're gonna get on home.

20:47.836 --> 20:49.067
- All right.
- All right.

20:49.090 --> 20:51.089
Come on, man!
It's New Year's, let's get outta here!

20:51.406 --> 20:52.753
Call me, Carl.
Happy New Year!

20:52.971 --> 20:55.806
- Sure you don't need any help?
- No, we're all set. Thanks.

20:55.900 --> 20:56.592
All right.

20:57.059 --> 21:00.096
Goddamn it! I've seen you do
some pretty stupid things, Jacob.

21:00.271 --> 21:02.477
But that pretty much takes the cake!

21:02.857 --> 21:05.395
- It was my idea.
- Oh, well, that's brilliant, Lou.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.894
Now when they find the plane,
and they realize the money's gone,

21:08.071 --> 21:10.112
they'll know right off who took it.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.442
Well, that's... that's what's
cool about it, though.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.155
I mean, we wouldn't tell somebody
if we were the ones that did it.

21:17.332 --> 21:19.787
It's not like he said that you actually
saw a plane going down.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.202
Just you thought you might've
heard one with engine trouble.

21:22.379 --> 21:24.253
You want me to burn the money?!

21:24.799 --> 21:26.590
I am not going to prison over this!

21:26.759 --> 21:29.333
If it looks like there's even the slightest
chance of us getting caught,

21:29.512 --> 21:33.380
I swear to God, it's all gonna vanish!
You understand?

21:43.861 --> 21:47.638
"It was a pine apple."
Ha ha ha...

21:59.046 --> 22:02.289
Oh, God...
This is gonna be fun.

22:04.134 --> 22:06.200
Where the hell have you been?!

22:06.400 --> 22:10.072
You always come when I'm finished.
I'm finished, you asshole!

22:12.978 --> 22:13.760
Hey, Nancy!

22:15.498 --> 22:17.308
Don't... Don't hit...
Don't hit Mary Beth.

22:17.608 --> 22:20.182
Remember, nobody knows about this.
That includes Nancy.

22:20.436 --> 22:22.655
She's gonna have to find out
about it sooner or later.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.530
She's gonna wonder where all
the money's coming from.

22:24.690 --> 22:25.744
2 hours late!

22:25.960 --> 22:26.644
Stop it!

22:26.750 --> 22:29.982
Tell her when we decide
it's safe to keep it, but not before then.

22:30.706 --> 22:31.952
Then the same goes for Sarah.

22:33.126 --> 22:34.288
Of course.

22:35.295 --> 22:35.959
Damn it!

22:36.129 --> 22:40.627
Come on! You promised to shovel
the walk, you lazy son of a bitch!

22:40.801 --> 22:42.800
Calm down, baby!
I got a good reason for being late.

22:42.899 --> 22:43.899
What?

22:44.050 --> 22:45.127
See you, Lou!

22:49.061 --> 22:50.934
You know, I bet he's telling her.

22:52.021 --> 22:53.516
That guy can't keep a secret.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.401
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

23:09.792 --> 23:10.823
Where you been?

23:17.717 --> 23:19.093
I was starting to get worried about you.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.630
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, that's all right.

23:21.633 --> 23:22.970
Hey!

23:22.973 --> 23:24.384
What happened to your head?

23:24.559 --> 23:27.180
- It's OK. It's just a scratch.
- It's all bloody.

23:28.313 --> 23:29.808
Can I ask you something?

23:30.200 --> 23:31.310
Yeah, sure.

23:33.068 --> 23:34.527
What if you were walking in the woods...

23:34.695 --> 23:35.893
It's not deep.

23:36.071 --> 23:38.195
And you found a bag full of money,

23:38.866 --> 23:42.995
let's say $4 million...
Would you keep it?

23:44.289 --> 23:46.282
Of course not.
Here, hold that.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.538
How come?

23:47.710 --> 23:50.462
Well, for starters, it'd be stealing.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.916
We were talking about lost money here,
nobody's looking for it.

23:57.388 --> 23:59.795
- $4 million of lost money...
- Yeah.

24:00.056 --> 24:01.635
- that nobody's looking for?
- Yeah.

24:03.811 --> 24:05.934
Well, so then whose money is it?

24:06.230 --> 24:07.226
Yours.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.250
Oh!

24:09.248 --> 24:10.291
Ooh!

24:11.612 --> 24:15.480
It's my money?
But whose money was it before?

24:15.866 --> 24:17.408
A bank robber's.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.411
So then it's the bank's money.

24:21.581 --> 24:25.033
All right, it's, uh, a drug dealer's.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.700
Hank.

24:30.966 --> 24:32.600
I mean, this is really silly.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.668
Obviously you want me to say
something in particular.

24:34.847 --> 24:37.698
I don't know what it is, but you
want me to agree with you or say

24:37.700 --> 24:40.637
that you're right or something.
But I wouldn't take it.

24:40.811 --> 24:42.603
That's just me. I wouldn't.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.404
It's real.

25:12.222 --> 25:15.139
If we keep it, we never have to
worry about money again.

25:16.060 --> 25:18.550
But we don't have to worry
about money now, Hank.

25:19.020 --> 25:20.681
You've got a good job.

25:21.190 --> 25:22.601
We don't need it.

25:23.443 --> 25:26.444
Yeah, but nobody gets
hurt by us keeping it.

25:29.283 --> 25:33.363
I mean, that's what makes it a crime,
doesn't it? Somebody getting hurt?

25:33.663 --> 25:35.702
What makes it a crime
is that it's against the law.

25:35.773 --> 25:37.823
It doesn't matter if somebody
gets hurt or if they don't.

25:37.990 --> 25:40.590
- If you get caught, then you go to jail.
- Nobody's gonna get caught.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.150
The money's the only evidence
that we've done anything wrong.

25:44.049 --> 25:47.253
We sit on it, we see what happens.

25:47.428 --> 25:51.509
If somebody comes searching for it,
then we just burn it and that will be that.

25:51.808 --> 25:54.478
There's no risk.
We'll always be in control.

25:55.270 --> 25:56.979
What about Jacob and Lou?

25:57.148 --> 26:00.683
As long as we're handling the money
they have to let us call the shots.

26:02.278 --> 26:07.522
It seems... crazy just to give it up.

26:07.784 --> 26:10.323
I mean, before we know if
anybody's searching for it.

26:13.165 --> 26:15.703
This is it.
It ain't champagne, but...

26:17.170 --> 26:18.545
Happy New Year!

26:29.934 --> 26:32.556
You have to go back and
return some of the money.

26:33.726 --> 26:34.968
What?

26:36.066 --> 26:39.601
A lot. Like 500,000.

26:40.321 --> 26:44.402
You see, that way when they find the plane
they'll assume nobody's been there yet.

26:44.576 --> 26:46.568
It will put us beyond suspicion.

26:46.745 --> 26:48.568
No one would walk away
from that much money...

26:48.658 --> 26:49.897
Wait a second!

26:51.459 --> 26:52.573
We're gonna keep the rest?

26:53.210 --> 26:57.078
You'll have to go in the morning
so when it storms later it'll cover your tracks.

26:58.258 --> 26:59.421
You can't tell Jacob though.

27:00.343 --> 27:01.838
What, do you think
he'd go back and take it?

27:04.097 --> 27:05.889
It's... it's just being careful.

27:06.517 --> 27:09.091
That's what we have to be from now on.
We have to be careful.

27:09.270 --> 27:11.144
We have to be thinking ahead all the time.

27:12.936 --> 27:15.379
OK. OK.

27:19.253 --> 27:20.296
OK.

27:40.233 --> 27:41.475
Jacob!

27:44.643 --> 27:46.683
Jacob, come on, open up!

27:53.362 --> 27:55.745
Hey, I screwed up,
I moved the pilot.

27:55.845 --> 27:58.494
Come on, we gotta go put
him back like he was.

27:59.702 --> 28:01.446
Come on, I need a lookout.

28:17.014 --> 28:20.200
If somebody comes by,
you pretend you're changing the tire.

28:24.647 --> 28:26.604
You know, that's not gonna work.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.312
What do you mean,
it's not gonna work?

28:28.693 --> 28:30.567
Nobody's gonna believe that.
It's not flat.

28:34.783 --> 28:36.361
You're kinda crafty.

28:38.246 --> 28:39.740
I observe things.

28:40.414 --> 28:43.838
Observe and learn, my friend.
Observe and learn.

28:52.011 --> 28:53.209
That's cool.

29:55.082 --> 29:56.956
Jacob, what happened,
she die on you?

29:57.126 --> 29:58.856
No, we had a flat.
We had a flat tire.

29:59.087 --> 30:01.800
I fixed it. See?
The new one's on there now.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.126
I took the other one,
the bad one, and put it in the trunk.

30:04.235 --> 30:05.910
It's back there now,
flat as a pancake.

30:06.020 --> 30:07.536
But it's cool now.
Everything's all right.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.847
You see that God damned fox
come by here about 5 minutes ago

30:11.017 --> 30:12.475
heading right on down
to the woods?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.950
No, I didn't see a fox.
I didn't see any fox.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.913
Well, if you'd been standing where
I'm sitting he'd have bit you on the ass.

30:35.194 --> 30:36.536
Why don't you stay here?

30:36.694 --> 30:37.736
Hey, Hank!

30:42.427 --> 30:44.586
Don't do anything stupid.

30:48.655 --> 30:49.893
Jacob!

30:52.000 --> 30:53.541
Oh, God...

30:53.741 --> 30:55.899
Jesus, Jacob, what the fuck?!

30:56.361 --> 30:59.104
I... I... I... I hit...
I hit the farmer.

30:59.613 --> 31:02.091
- He was tracking a fox. I... I...
- Dwight!

31:02.206 --> 31:04.000
He was gonna go right by the plane.
I had to do something.

31:04.082 --> 31:05.700
I was just trying to help us out.

31:05.870 --> 31:09.536
Just listen... listen to his...
to his heart or something like that.

31:09.219 --> 31:10.992
Come on, man, listen.
You gotta do it... you...

31:11.752 --> 31:12.701
He's... he's gonna be OK.

31:13.170 --> 31:15.210
Oh, God, Jacob,
I think you killed him.

31:15.381 --> 31:18.358
I'm pretty sure he's gonna be OK.
What else was I gonna do?

31:18.760 --> 31:20.551
Oh, God. He's dead.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.843
Oh, Hank, that's not right.

31:25.170 --> 31:26.942
No, we could probably...
We could probably do...

31:28.229 --> 31:30.471
We can probably do that CPR deal.

31:30.648 --> 31:33.685
And you know, you could do that, uh,
cardiac arrest thing, couldn't you?

31:33.860 --> 31:35.403
We could do something,
goddamn it!

31:35.571 --> 31:37.065
Jacob, what the hell you doing?

31:37.148 --> 31:38.898
- Stop it!
- Come on!

31:38.990 --> 31:40.353
I'm working CPR!

31:40.554 --> 31:41.655
Goddamn it, stop it!

31:41.800 --> 31:42.800
Come on! Come on!

31:42.912 --> 31:46.862
Be still. Let me think.
OK, we can't panic.

31:47.792 --> 31:49.406
Have any cars gone by?

31:49.407 --> 31:51.935
- Uh, cars?
- Cars, cars, come on, think.

31:51.950 --> 31:53.573
While I was in the woods,
you see any cars go by?

31:53.674 --> 31:54.374
Why, Hank?

31:56.197 --> 31:57.297
Oh, God.

31:57.451 --> 31:58.923
All right.

31:59.306 --> 32:00.681
We gotta make this look
like it was an accident.

32:00.506 --> 32:02.081
- Come on.
- An accident?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.426
Grab his legs.

32:07.314 --> 32:09.806
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't do that.

32:09.984 --> 32:11.552
What do you mean we can't do it?

32:11.694 --> 32:14.541
Because we're gonna make tracks and
they're gonna see them and follow 'em.

32:14.550 --> 32:16.551
It's gonna be like a
crime scene or something.

32:16.650 --> 32:18.575
We're gonna drive the car
back to the bridge.

32:18.744 --> 32:20.571
I'll put him on the snowmobile
and take him through the park.

32:21.288 --> 32:23.827
You gotta get there ahead of me.

32:22.453 --> 32:24.331
So whatever you do,
I don't want you to stop.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.289
I want you to just drive
on by then circle back.

32:25.790 --> 32:27.041
I don't want people to
see you sitting there.

32:26.461 --> 32:28.750
- Circle back?
- That's right.

32:27.876 --> 32:29.075
That's right.

32:29.076 --> 32:30.430
Come on, come on now.

32:32.927 --> 32:34.801
They're not gonna take me away, are they?
I mean, you gotta promise me...

32:34.970 --> 32:37.592
Nobody's gonna take you away,
I promise. But we gotta hurry.

32:37.765 --> 32:38.761
It's gonna be OK, right, Hank?

32:38.933 --> 32:40.345
Come on, we gotta go.

32:40.519 --> 32:43.100
- You gonna be there, right?
- I'm gonna be there. Now just go!

32:43.359 --> 32:44.437
Go!

33:22.774 --> 33:23.890
Dwight?

33:26.902 --> 33:28.351
Dwight!

33:28.573 --> 33:29.901
Your brother.

33:31.451 --> 33:32.826
He hit me.

33:36.456 --> 33:37.620
You call the police.

33:40.962 --> 33:42.540
Get the police.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.502
Jacob, what are you doing?
Come on, before anybody sees!

35:40.680 --> 35:42.340
- I'm not gonna do this.
- What?

35:42.515 --> 35:45.137
Well, it's just stupid. I mean, if...
See, if we cover it up

35:45.310 --> 35:48.347
it's just gonna be worse anyhow.
So, you know, I'm... I'm just...

35:48.401 --> 35:48.922
Get in the car!

35:49.064 --> 35:52.149
I'm just gonna go and pull him out, you know?
We're just gonna tell everybody the truth.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.149
Just gonna tell 'em about the money
and everything and just say that I... that I...

35:55.322 --> 35:57.778
- You're gonna leave tracks!
- Wait a minute.

35:58.450 --> 36:00.608
This is my decision!

36:00.649 --> 36:01.786
Mine!

36:01.787 --> 36:03.198
Not yours!

36:08.712 --> 36:10.336
You didn't kill him.

36:17.096 --> 36:18.805
We both did.

36:21.058 --> 36:22.719
What are you talking about, Hank?

36:26.273 --> 36:30.223
He was alive when you left.
I smothered him.

36:31.821 --> 36:34.110
I guess that makes it my decision.

36:54.847 --> 36:57.469
It's gonna be OK.
I mean, it looked real.

36:57.642 --> 37:01.971
And even if... I mean, let's say it didn't
look like an accident. Whatever. I mean...

37:02.773 --> 37:04.183
Why would anyone think of us?

37:04.358 --> 37:06.232
Your tracks lead right to the plane.

37:06.986 --> 37:09.987
But it's gonna snow! Any minute now,
it's gonna start snowing.

37:10.156 --> 37:11.615
Was there any blood?

37:12.241 --> 37:12.906
Blood?

37:13.160 --> 37:16.861
Jacob hit him.
Was there blood anywhere?

37:14.875 --> 37:17.230
Did he get blood on anything?
Was there blood on the road or...

37:17.328 --> 37:18.244
I don't remember.

37:18.415 --> 37:20.325
- Did you look?
- I looked, but I... I just don't...

37:20.501 --> 37:22.540
I mean, it was all hap...

37:23.713 --> 37:27.289
Honey, it's gonna snow. It's gonna snow
and everything's gonna be covered up.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.991
- All the tracks...
- Shh.

37:30.554 --> 37:32.962
<i>He was apparently trying to cross
along this bank of snow.</i>

37:33.141 --> 37:35.809
<i>when his snowmobile slipped over the edge</i>

37:35.976 --> 37:39.511
<i>throwing him into the icy
waters of Anders creek.</i>

37:39.689 --> 37:44.767
<i>Wright county deputies recovered the body
shortly before 4:00 this afternoon.</i>

37:44.945 --> 37:49.323
<i>A tragic beginning to this new year
for one local family.</i>

37:49.700 --> 37:51.195
<i>Back to you, Paul.</i>

37:51.196 --> 37:52.395
<i>Thanks, Tracy.</i>

37:59.211 --> 38:01.750
I wish you hadn't told Jacob.

38:03.466 --> 38:05.044
I wish he still thought that he did it.

38:05.969 --> 38:06.799
Does it scare you?

38:07.137 --> 38:08.964
Yeah, it scares me.
What if he tells somebody?

38:09.139 --> 38:10.135
I mean, what I did.

38:11.934 --> 38:13.262
What you did?

38:13.600 --> 38:17.646
Well, I know that you only did it
because you felt trapped, ...

38:16.382 --> 38:18.467
that you couldn't find any other way.

38:18.620 --> 38:22.992
Would you have done the same thing?
I mean, if you'd been there instead of me?

38:26.084 --> 38:28.907
I... I...
I just need to know if it's possible.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.324
Oh, honey!

38:50.644 --> 38:52.476
You listening to me, Hank?

38:52.544 --> 38:56.900
Every Monday I come down here,
buy 2 bags of feed, regular as clock work.

38:57.193 --> 39:02.350
2 bags of wheat, 4 times a month.
That's 8 bags I'm supposed to be billed for.

39:02.400 --> 39:06.152
- I don't know how else to get through to you.
- December started on a Monday, Mr. Schmitt.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.000
So there were 5 mondays in the month.
So you came in here 5...

39:08.080 --> 39:10.453
Are you telling me there were
5 weeks last month?

39:10.625 --> 39:13.579
No, sir, I'm telling you
there were 5 Mondays. Excuse me.

39:14.838 --> 39:15.669
I got it.

39:15.700 --> 39:16.631
Yeah.

39:16.632 --> 39:18.209
<i>Hey, Hank, it's me.</i>

39:18.717 --> 39:20.093
Hang on a second.

39:20.595 --> 39:23.051
Listen, check that calendar over there
if you don't believe me, sir.

39:23.223 --> 39:24.302
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

39:24.474 --> 39:26.763
Well, I'm a little busy right now, Jacob.
What is it?

39:26.935 --> 39:29.225
<i>OK, listen,
can you meet me at the farm?</i>

39:29.689 --> 39:31.017
- What farm?
<i>- Our farm.</i>

39:32.107 --> 39:33.851
Look, uh, what is it?

39:34.026 --> 39:36.518
<i>On your lunch break.
12:30, OK?</i>

39:36.863 --> 39:39.105
Hey, are we straight on this, Mr. Schmitt?

39:40.034 --> 39:41.444
Thanks for coming in.

39:43.079 --> 39:44.988
Look, I can't drive out there right...

39:45.100 --> 39:46.188
Jacob?

40:09.738 --> 40:10.881
Jacob?

40:12.405 --> 40:14.982
Hey, what are you doing here?

40:15.070 --> 40:17.521
Look out!
Ha ha ha ha ha.

40:17.868 --> 40:20.359
- What the hell'd you drag me out here for?
- Listen to this. I'm gonna buy it back.

40:20.871 --> 40:24.454
I'm gonna fix it up. I'm gonna rebuild it
just like it was before mom and dad died.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.787
Whoa, whoa. Come on, wait, wait.
We've been through all this.

40:26.794 --> 40:31.540
We've been over this. Once we split up
the money, we've gotta leave. We have to go.

40:33.677 --> 40:38.055
What do you... what do you want me to do,
just like that, just drive off by myself?

40:40.000 --> 40:41.600
Well, I mean, suppose you stay...

40:41.720 --> 40:43.583
Where are you gonna tell
people you got the money?

40:43.675 --> 40:44.900
Oh, that's easy.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.200
We just tell people that Sarah
inherited some money. It's easy.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.155
You know, nobody around here
knows anything about her family.

40:53.157 --> 40:57.986
You guys could've just bought the farm,
you know, and then left me to run it.

40:58.163 --> 41:00.571
- It's not gonna work.
- I thought this was gonna make you happy.

41:00.842 --> 41:02.184
Jacob...

41:03.669 --> 41:05.828
Farming? Come on.

41:07.215 --> 41:11.165
You don't just buy a farm.
You gotta... you gotta work it.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.925
You gotta know about machinery and seed.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.473
- I know that.
- No, you don't.

41:15.641 --> 41:20.242
Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
drainage, irrigation, the weather?

41:20.300 --> 41:22.724
Come on, you don't know
about any of that stuff.

41:22.899 --> 41:24.975
You're gonna end up just like dad!

41:25.528 --> 41:26.808
Why do you think he ended up like that?

41:26.987 --> 41:29.146
I'll tell you how he ended up like that.

41:29.323 --> 41:32.775
He had 2 mortgages riding on the place.
He couldn't make the payments.

41:32.952 --> 41:35.526
- Where do you think the money went?
- He was a bad businessman.

41:35.706 --> 41:39.289
Where do you think the money went?
No, you think he spent it all on the farm?

41:39.460 --> 41:42.664
I'll tell you exactly where the money went:
4 years of college, bud!

41:44.215 --> 41:46.341
Yeah, or didn't you ever think
about how he paid for that?

41:46.655 --> 41:49.213
- Didn't that ever occur to you?
- No, my tuition was...

41:49.323 --> 41:51.885
Listen, I'm supposed to get the farm!

41:53.734 --> 41:57.635
What do I get?!
I'm supposed to get the farm.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.800
Jacob, you got... you got...
the whole world. You can...

42:03.062 --> 42:05.069
I don't wanna hear that.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.988
You can go anywhere you want.

42:16.494 --> 42:18.153
This is what I want.

42:20.373 --> 42:22.661
This is... this is where
I wanna be.

42:24.085 --> 42:25.745
It's my home, Hank.

42:47.706 --> 42:48.749
Shit.

43:06.049 --> 43:07.248
- Hey, honey.
- What?

43:07.426 --> 43:09.751
I wanna show you something.

43:12.058 --> 43:13.205
- What is it?
- I got this...

43:13.300 --> 43:16.013
I had it sent over
from the other branch.

43:16.352 --> 43:17.182
Look, here it is.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.805
"Heiress's body ID'd by feds."

43:19.981 --> 43:22.224
"$4.4 million ransom."

43:22.651 --> 43:27.444
You see? This person nobody knows
has just disappeared right into thin air.

43:28.575 --> 43:30.282
Do you recognize one
of them from the plane?

43:30.451 --> 43:31.781
I can't tell.

43:32.287 --> 43:34.078
His face was...

43:38.000 --> 43:39.100
What?

43:39.257 --> 43:40.831
This changes it.

43:40.900 --> 43:42.120
Why is that?

43:43.550 --> 43:45.542
We can't say it isn't stealing anymore.

43:47.229 --> 43:50.894
Well, Hank, it's always been stealing.
We just didn't know who we were stealing from.

43:51.150 --> 43:54.203
We thought it was drug money.
We thought it was money that we could find...

43:54.233 --> 43:56.875
- No, you thought that. This is good. I'm glad...
- It's good?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.860
Yes, it's good we know where it's from,
because I was starting to get worried.

43:59.990 --> 44:02.689
I thought that it might
be counterfeit or marked.

44:02.850 --> 44:04.856
- It might still be marked.
- No, it says right here.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.114
Look: "denomination in unmarked bills".
Unmarked, you see?

44:11.748 --> 44:15.918
You're just being paranoid, Hank.
It's over. It's good.

44:16.474 --> 44:18.142
Sarah?

44:18.714 --> 44:20.043
Would you come here, please?

44:20.216 --> 44:22.340
Sure. OK, just a second.

44:22.636 --> 44:24.260
I'll see you tonight.

45:21.013 --> 45:22.100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Jesus!

45:24.100 --> 45:25.787
Hey, come on, Hank!
Open up!

45:26.600 --> 45:30.150
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, "Mr. Accountant"!

45:30.165 --> 45:32.000
Well, I've come to make a tiny withdrawal.

45:32.100 --> 45:34.000
Go home.
Turn around and go home right now.

45:34.142 --> 45:37.550
- Oh, come on! It's freezing out here, Hank!
- Shh! Keep it down!

45:37.887 --> 45:39.381
All right, just for a second.

45:42.559 --> 45:45.845
I don't have time for this shit.
I gotta get up and go to work.

45:46.605 --> 45:48.065
I want my share.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.269
What?

45:49.400 --> 45:51.559
I do. I want my share.

45:53.238 --> 45:56.400
I don't have the money here,
and even if I did, I wouldn't give you any.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.600
Oh, come on, now.

45:57.690 --> 46:00.483
Look, just because you have it
doesn't mean it's yours.

46:01.038 --> 46:03.161
Part of that is my money.

46:04.041 --> 46:06.367
Part of it might be your money...

46:07.211 --> 46:09.169
If we decide to keep it.

46:09.339 --> 46:12.251
The plan was to sit on the money
till we decide that it's safe to keep it.

46:12.300 --> 46:14.950
- Why are you coming over here with this shit?
- All right, look. I'll tell you what.

46:15.054 --> 46:18.138
Just give me one packet, OK?

46:18.342 --> 46:23.220
Just one packet.
And I'll come back later for the rest.

46:24.940 --> 46:28.024
Ask me again, and I'll go
burn it tomorrow morning.

46:28.402 --> 46:29.731
Is that clear?

46:32.491 --> 46:33.491
It's a bluff.

46:33.550 --> 46:34.739
What?

46:34.835 --> 46:38.435
Yeah, it's a bluff!
B-L-U-F-F.

46:38.663 --> 46:42.080
Oh, then why don't you call it then
and just see what happens?

46:42.807 --> 46:44.257
- Yeah.
- All right. OK.

46:45.046 --> 46:48.545
See, Jacob told me a little secret,
"Mr. Accountant".

46:50.010 --> 46:53.545
I know what happened to Dwight Stephanson.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.435
You drank too much.

46:59.605 --> 47:01.597
I want one of those packets!

47:03.526 --> 47:08.000
I told you, I don't have the money here.
I hid it away from the house.

47:08.100 --> 47:11.950
Mm-hmm. Well, you know what?
It'd be a shame if somebody was to

47:12.000 --> 47:14.340
drop a note to Carl Jenkins saying

47:14.370 --> 47:18.960
there might just be a little something
suspicious about Dwight Stephanson's accident.

47:19.001 --> 47:22.951
He just drove off that bridge?
Do you believe that? Do you?!

47:23.131 --> 47:25.088
Come on. Jesus, Lou!

47:25.383 --> 47:28.171
Remember, you're a thief, too.

47:28.637 --> 47:32.302
We're all in this together.
If one of us goes to jail, we all do.

47:45.340 --> 47:46.382
Oh, God.

47:50.244 --> 47:52.487
I need my share, Hank.

47:53.289 --> 47:54.405
I do.

47:55.834 --> 47:57.294
I'm broke...

47:58.546 --> 48:00.337
And I owe people money.

48:03.546 --> 48:07.190
- Christ, Lou, I mean wh-wh...
- I need some help here, man.

48:09.516 --> 48:11.095
OK, just wait here.

48:28.269 --> 48:29.916
Here, here.

48:31.417 --> 48:32.365
40 dollars?

48:32.751 --> 48:34.411
Shh! That's all I got.

48:34.627 --> 48:37.795
Maybe I can go to the bank
and get you a loan out of our savings.

48:38.092 --> 48:42.169
Look, look, look.
The money's a day's drive from here.

48:42.345 --> 48:45.263
Even if I wanted go get it, I can't go get it,
not till Sarah has the baby.

48:45.432 --> 48:46.463
A day's drive?!

48:47.059 --> 48:51.093
Yeah, that's right. I put it in a storage locker
above the interstate.

48:51.388 --> 48:55.925
- What the hell is it doing in a storage...
- Shh! It's safe. Don't worry, all right?

48:56.269 --> 48:58.559
I didn't want it near us in case
we come under any suspicion.

48:58.731 --> 49:01.056
- How the hell's that gonna happen?
- How's that gonna happen?

49:01.233 --> 49:04.819
How about Carl knowing about
the plane, huh? Who's idea was that?

49:07.905 --> 49:08.948
Yeah.

49:09.105 --> 49:10.148
All right.

49:11.953 --> 49:17.861
But we go get it as soon as she's done,
split it up right there...

49:18.250 --> 49:19.494
Right?

49:23.409 --> 49:24.451
Yeah.

49:31.853 --> 49:33.000
Hank...

49:34.565 --> 49:39.234
# Skippy and Buddy...
# Skippy and Buddy...

49:44.199 --> 49:46.211
Hey, I said whoa.

49:46.399 --> 49:50.611
I'm looking for Hank and Sarah.
I'm sorry.

49:53.735 --> 49:55.063
Oh, God, look at this.

49:57.213 --> 50:00.001
Do you have a car seat in the car
you'll be traveling home in?

50:00.467 --> 50:01.795
Is it currently installed?

50:01.968 --> 50:03.594
Hello, look who's here!

50:04.888 --> 50:07.925
Bearing tidings and gifts and great joy.

50:08.100 --> 50:09.263
Would you sign here?

50:09.685 --> 50:11.457
Sure.

50:11.813 --> 50:13.687
What do you mean "gambling"?
Where?

50:13.857 --> 50:15.399
At the casino. He lost some money.

50:15.567 --> 50:17.856
- How much?
- I don't know how much.

50:17.990 --> 50:19.172
Shh!

50:19.238 --> 50:21.019
- Hey, congratulations!
- Thank you.

50:21.464 --> 50:22.714
Did you see that little baby?

50:22.575 --> 50:24.449
It looked like a little tomato.

50:24.619 --> 50:27.905
How could you have told him that, huh?

50:28.624 --> 50:31.910
I put myself out for you.
What do you do, you betray me?

50:32.086 --> 50:32.999
What are you talking about?

50:33.170 --> 50:36.207
What am I talking about?
It's like there's two sides now.

50:36.716 --> 50:40.500
Why are you both always talking
about sides? There's no sides.

50:40.678 --> 50:42.054
Who's talking about sides?

50:42.723 --> 50:46.057
I'm on both of your sides.
We're all in this together, man.

50:46.227 --> 50:49.562
If you had to pick right now,
who'd it be?

50:49.750 --> 50:51.521
No, I don't...
why would I wanna pick?

50:51.700 --> 50:52.940
No, I wanna know...

50:53.710 --> 50:55.356
Me or Lou?

51:05.916 --> 51:07.789
Good grief, man. I...

51:09.461 --> 51:11.455
I'd pick you.
You're my brother.

51:29.234 --> 51:31.903
I bou... I bought
a present for the baby.

51:35.031 --> 51:38.566
OK... OK, I... I brought it from the house.
I didn't buy it, but, look, it's...

51:39.912 --> 51:41.914
It's kinda cool.
Just trust me on this one.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.874
You're gonna like it, I think,
when you see what it is.

51:53.424 --> 51:54.467
Thanks.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.813
- God, it's used.
- Let me see that.

52:08.403 --> 52:10.362
Oh, my gosh, this was his...

52:10.655 --> 52:12.280
when we were kids.

52:13.284 --> 52:14.943
Oh, I guess it's sweet
of him then, isn't it?

52:15.118 --> 52:16.613
Buddy the bear.

52:16.954 --> 52:18.532
Here's your little girl.

52:22.502 --> 52:23.761
Oh, good, good, good.

52:24.671 --> 52:27.756
Got her?
She's just about ready for her feeding.

52:27.925 --> 52:29.502
Would you grab that thing?

52:29.503 --> 52:32.002
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

52:33.890 --> 52:35.966
Hello, little girl.

52:37.090 --> 52:38.166
Hello.

52:39.104 --> 52:40.433
She's hungry.

52:48.156 --> 52:50.778
I want you to buy one of
those little tape recorders.

52:51.034 --> 52:53.821
You know, the little dictating kind,
the kind you can hide in your pocket?

52:54.080 --> 52:55.360
Why do you want a tape recorder?

52:55.831 --> 52:57.955
You're gonna tape Lou
confessing to Stephanson's murder.

52:58.501 --> 53:00.125
What?
What are you talking about?

53:06.635 --> 53:10.633
You and Jacob invite him out for drinks.
Get him drunk.

53:11.266 --> 53:13.222
You take him back to his place.

53:13.392 --> 53:17.477
Then you start joking around,
kidding about confessing to the police.

53:17.520 --> 53:20.016
Each of you takes a turn
pretending how you'd do it.

53:20.359 --> 53:21.937
You go first,

53:23.154 --> 53:26.751
Jacob second, and Lou last.
And when Lou goes, you tape him.

53:28.327 --> 53:29.607
Come on, that's not gonna work.

53:29.786 --> 53:32.263
Jacob helps you.
That's the key.

53:32.706 --> 53:34.996
If Jacob eggs him on, he'll do it.

53:35.168 --> 53:39.379
Yeah, but even if he, you know, even if he
talks on the tape, it won't mean anything.

53:39.547 --> 53:41.504
I mean, who's ever gonna believe it?

53:41.884 --> 53:45.716
Well, it doesn't matter
as long as Lou believes it,

53:46.096 --> 53:48.718
as long as he sees that
Jacob's taking your side.

53:49.684 --> 53:51.094
That's all you want.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.394
We should at least try,
shouldn't we?

53:56.566 --> 53:59.058
We can't lose anything by trying...

54:00.058 --> 54:01.457
Right?

54:02.657 --> 54:04.558
Come on, it's not like
I'm asking you to do that much.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.278
Here, just pick up the phone
and give him a call and say:

54:06.350 --> 54:08.200
"Hey, Lou, Hank suggested we go out
drinking." tomorrow night."

54:08.496 --> 54:11.248
Hank suggested we go out drinking?
What are talking about?

54:11.416 --> 54:14.204
- Will you let me finish?
- We suggest we go out drinking.

54:12.616 --> 54:15.420
- You don't ever suggest we go out drinking.
- I'm getting to that. Let me finish.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.000
I'm saying:

54:17.150 --> 54:19.206
Tell him I've agreed to split up the money.

54:19.384 --> 54:22.420
I thought it'd be a good idea for us to...
to go out and celebrate first.

54:22.721 --> 54:25.638
So you want me to trick him?
You want me to trick Lou?

54:25.097 --> 54:26.765
You want me to trick my friend?
OK.

54:26.809 --> 54:28.600
Do you get what's happening here?

54:29.311 --> 54:31.139
Do you understand the seriousness
of the situation we're in?

54:31.314 --> 54:34.648
- He can put us both in jail, Jacob.
- He's not gonna send us to jail.

54:34.901 --> 54:39.563
Well, I can't take that chance,
not now, not with the baby.

54:40.783 --> 54:42.775
I can't afford to go to prison, Jacob.

54:42.993 --> 54:45.236
I mean, wh-what about Sarah, huh?

54:46.455 --> 54:47.915
Wh-what are they gonna do?

54:50.628 --> 54:52.627
I'm gonna have to get rid of that
Christmas tree out of here.

54:52.651 --> 54:54.379
It's too dry. It's gonna start a fire...

54:54.458 --> 54:57.004
Would you pay attention here?
Pay attention!

54:57.261 --> 55:01.381
- What would dad do?
- I'll think about it.

54:58.978 --> 55:00.436
Don't do that, please, Hank.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.336
Don't you think he'd
want us to stick together?

55:02.450 --> 55:06.895
Don't say that. I mean, you don't
know what the hell dad would do.

55:04.556 --> 55:07.225
That's fucked up.
Don't bring him up.

55:17.967 --> 55:19.109
Well...

55:20.452 --> 55:24.285
What if I was to say I'd help you
get the farm back, huh?

55:28.985 --> 55:30.463
All right...

55:31.507 --> 55:33.713
I'll help you buy back the farm.

55:35.845 --> 55:37.838
But you got to help me first.

55:46.273 --> 55:48.979
You know, all I meant by that
about the tree is it's just dried out.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.737
And it could start a fucking fire.
You know how that stuff goes.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.548
It wasn't like I was trying to ignore you
or something like that.

55:56.618 --> 55:59.906
I was just, you know, I was talking about
practical shit to you is all it was.

56:13.137 --> 56:16.506
Yeah, we got that white carpet.

56:18.229 --> 56:19.876
- Honey?
- Oh. Oh, hey.

56:19.980 --> 56:20.980
Hey, Sarah.

56:21.023 --> 56:22.195
Hey, Jacob.

56:22.481 --> 56:24.936
I take my shoes off for you there, see?

56:24.937 --> 56:25.818
Thank you.

56:26.152 --> 56:27.694
Oh, uh...

56:28.200 --> 56:29.363
It's a nice shirt.

56:29.950 --> 56:31.563
Ta-da! Ha ha.

56:32.451 --> 56:34.443
Here, let me do that.

56:34.744 --> 56:36.239
Hey, I gotta pee.

56:36.413 --> 56:37.528
Yeah, go ahead.

56:41.142 --> 56:43.003
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

56:43.255 --> 56:46.173
- You brought him here?
- Yeah. I invited him for dinner.

56:47.509 --> 56:49.954
Oh! Good.
Good, good.

56:50.389 --> 56:53.849
OK...
So he's gonna do it?

56:56.018 --> 56:57.774
I had to promise him the farm.

56:57.775 --> 56:59.950
You what?
Wait, I thought you said...

57:00.000 --> 57:02.359
we agreed that you were
gonna say something.

57:02.455 --> 57:05.283
Where's he supposed to go,
Sarah, huh? I mean...

57:05.284 --> 57:08.000
What's he gonna do, drive away?

57:08.121 --> 57:11.195
I don't know, honey. I don't know,
but if he stays, we get caught.

57:12.522 --> 57:14.399
I know, I know. It's just...

57:14.581 --> 57:16.206
It's just a matter of
time before he screws up.

57:16.374 --> 57:18.866
I know. That's not what I'm saying.
I just...

57:23.675 --> 57:25.714
I just wish he could, that's all.

57:31.100 --> 57:33.591
No, no, you remember what she did?

57:33.769 --> 57:37.898
She was so freaked out that she called
the volunteer fire department,

57:38.066 --> 57:39.477
and then, remember,
they came out...

57:39.651 --> 57:41.858
- Oh, yeah, there was all of dad's buddies...
- All his drinkin' buddies.

57:42.495 --> 57:43.712
Yeah, yeah.

57:43.822 --> 57:45.400
That's... that's all the volunteer
fire department was,

57:45.022 --> 57:47.654
was guys he knew, you know?
So they show up...

57:47.702 --> 57:50.703
And he's sitting there in the kitchen
with that ice pack on his face.

57:50.872 --> 57:55.701
That's ridiculous. He felt like an idiot,
'cause they're all gathered in there

57:53.336 --> 57:56.914
like there's some huge
murder going down, you know?

57:57.000 --> 57:58.863
Shh, shh.

58:05.639 --> 58:07.081
OK.

58:09.018 --> 58:10.927
Well, back on call.

58:11.646 --> 58:13.572
Hey, how about some more wine?
You got a full glass here.

58:13.648 --> 58:16.684
What's it like, a walkie-talkie, Sarah,
kind of like a baby walkie-talkie?

58:16.860 --> 58:18.652
Yeah, yeah.
It's kinda cool.

58:18.821 --> 58:21.739
Remember, we had that thing we did
with them little walkie-talkies?

58:21.908 --> 58:24.113
- Oh, yeah.
- You got that kit for Christmas.

58:24.410 --> 58:25.573
Remember that?

58:26.748 --> 58:27.790
Yeah.

58:27.791 --> 58:29.042
Yeah.

58:29.332 --> 58:32.998
You know, it's weird.
I think... I think about that stuff.

58:31.805 --> 58:32.998
I think it's kinda weird...

58:33.170 --> 58:34.961
You remember everything, too,
don't you?

58:35.255 --> 58:38.506
Well, yeah. I was always...
I was always talking to dad.

58:39.719 --> 58:40.999
I know you were.

58:41.262 --> 58:44.139
I was always figuring out
what's going on, you know?

58:44.175 --> 58:46.339
I was always nervous about
shit, you know, I guess.

58:46.477 --> 58:48.386
But I tell you what, he's a...

58:50.064 --> 58:54.394
If he... if he had the still
like we got goin' on right now, you know?

58:55.319 --> 58:57.028
He would... he would... he
would have done the same thing.

58:57.197 --> 58:59.771
I don't know, I don't know.
I guess so.

58:59.950 --> 59:01.811
I mean, 'cause that's what he...

59:01.854 --> 59:04.278
He always wanted to get
everything set up, you know.

59:04.580 --> 59:08.164
I mean, he always wanted to have enough
to just take care of things and relax, you know.

59:08.257 --> 59:09.257
Yeah.

59:09.396 --> 59:13.338
He never quite had that,
so I think he'd done it.

59:12.255 --> 59:14.955
But, uh, I tell you what, he'd still...

59:15.716 --> 59:18.059
I guarantee you, if he'd had this,
he'd still be here.

59:18.100 --> 59:19.639
He'd never have done that.

59:24.645 --> 59:25.889
Done what?

59:26.313 --> 59:30.146
Killed hisself, you know.
It just wouldn't have happened.

59:30.850 --> 59:32.279
What?

59:33.405 --> 59:35.065
What are you talking about?

59:35.657 --> 59:37.615
Hank, dad killed himself,
you know that?

59:39.494 --> 59:41.534
What?
What are you talking about?

59:42.039 --> 59:44.578
Come on, what are you talking about?
They were drunk, they had a wreck.

59:44.751 --> 59:46.765
That's out on Jack's spur road.

59:46.800 --> 59:48.750
That's like that ramp is...
Where he went every day?

59:48.838 --> 59:52.504
You ain't gonna roll away
on a ramp like that.

59:53.010 --> 59:55.679
He'd be on that thing
8,000 times a year, you know.

59:56.138 --> 59:58.808
You think all of a sudden
he forgot his way?

59:59.308 --> 1:00:00.685
Good grief!

1:00:04.148 --> 1:00:07.000
He figured that, you know,
all that insurance money, it'd be...

1:00:07.037 --> 1:00:10.990
You know, it'd take care of the whole
deal that he wanted to... you know...

1:00:11.130 --> 1:00:14.823
- What? No, no. What? Wait...
- You know that, Hank.

1:00:15.786 --> 1:00:17.529
I mean, think about it.

1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.050
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
well, maybe I misjudged you, Hank.

1:01:00.150 --> 1:01:07.000
'Cause, I mean, you're a bit more,
well, I don't know, let's... let's say...

1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:12.111
serious... ha ha ha... than a guy like me.
And, you know, maybe sometimes...

1:01:12.150 --> 1:01:16.000
you can come across like you
sort of got a stick up your ass.

1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:20.608
I... I... I mean to... someone who
doesn't really know you, to...

1:01:20.758 --> 1:01:24.511
to someone who can't get beneath
that first impression.

1:01:24.613 --> 1:01:29.105
And, OK, OK, maybe...
Maybe sometimes...

1:01:29.243 --> 1:01:34.605
Well... I can come off
a little bit like an asshole.

1:01:34.606 --> 1:01:35.962
You think?
No, come on.

1:01:35.806 --> 1:01:37.162
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no! No.

1:01:39.011 --> 1:01:40.802
I know what I'm talking about.

1:01:43.891 --> 1:01:45.054
But fuck it.

1:01:46.144 --> 1:01:48.101
It's all in the past, right?

1:01:49.539 --> 1:01:50.685
What do you say?

1:01:51.234 --> 1:01:53.464
- Come on.
- Sounds good to me.

1:01:53.527 --> 1:01:57.135
- Hell, yes. Live and let live.
- Live and let live.

1:01:59.409 --> 1:02:01.152
I gotta take a leak.

1:02:07.251 --> 1:02:08.330
Don't look at me like that.

1:02:09.871 --> 1:02:10.712
Whoo!

1:02:10.713 --> 1:02:11.827
Jerk!

1:02:19.849 --> 1:02:21.722
What, you think that's funny?

1:02:22.422 --> 1:02:24.523
- Ahh!
- Ahh, what, huh?

1:02:24.559 --> 1:02:26.803
I'm asking you, you think it's funny tripping
a guy on the way to the fucking can?

1:02:26.982 --> 1:02:29.651
- Look, buddy...
- Oh, don't buddy me! What the...

1:02:29.860 --> 1:02:33.254
See, that right here is my buddy.
This guy right here is my buddy.

1:02:33.350 --> 1:02:36.157
You're not my fucking
buddy, huh, you got it?

1:02:36.300 --> 1:02:37.410
Come on up here!
Come on up here!

1:02:37.411 --> 1:02:39.070
I'll kill... come on!

1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:41.100
Come on. Come on.

1:02:41.214 --> 1:02:43.915
- It's not worth it.
- Come on out here, right out in front!

1:02:44.084 --> 1:02:47.454
I'll paint you up and down
the fucking sidewalk, motherfucker!

1:02:47.630 --> 1:02:49.706
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, shut the fuck up, Ray!

1:02:49.856 --> 1:02:51.168
Get out, asshole!

1:02:51.968 --> 1:02:53.797
You know what? You...
You shit in one hand.

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.236
You better get the fuck out of here!

1:03:10.197 --> 1:03:13.732
So, listen, if you got to pee,
pee out here.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:18.950
So... so anyway,

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.750
this one guy, see, he steps forward
and he says, uh, he says...

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.214
"You know what? The guy was OK
until we twisted his head back around,"

1:03:29.385 --> 1:03:32.137
"and then he just fucking died on us."

1:03:32.447 --> 1:03:33.646
You get it?

1:03:35.854 --> 1:03:37.529
Hey, I got one!

1:03:37.750 --> 1:03:38.913
Ah, shit...

1:03:38.938 --> 1:03:41.856
This old drunk was telling jokes...

1:03:42.024 --> 1:03:44.730
to his 2 drunk friends, ...

1:03:44.903 --> 1:03:46.363
and he was keeping up his wife,

1:03:46.446 --> 1:03:48.819
who, unlike him, had a job
to go to in the morning.

1:03:48.991 --> 1:03:53.203
So, see, she gets so fucking fed up,
she comes downstairs and she says,

1:03:53.371 --> 1:03:58.574
"if he doesn't shut up, he's gonna have to
find some other place to live rent-free."

1:03:58.850 --> 1:04:01.995
- Do you get that one?
- No, listen, babe...

1:04:02.048 --> 1:04:04.207
Hey, baby, come on, now.
We're just drinking.

1:04:04.708 --> 1:04:06.665
Come on, what are you waiting for?
I don't want to be here all night.

1:04:06.750 --> 1:04:08.300
Let's get this over with.

1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:10.287
- I won't do it, Hank.
- What?

1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:13.711
It's not fair.

1:04:14.385 --> 1:04:15.549
We had a deal.

1:04:15.929 --> 1:04:17.340
It's not right.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.300
It's not right.

1:04:19.374 --> 1:04:20.721
Ah, dummy up!

1:04:22.103 --> 1:04:24.890
Better just keep it down a little bit.

1:04:25.192 --> 1:04:27.687
- Don't say anything.
- Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

1:04:28.192 --> 1:04:29.687
You know how it is.

1:04:30.279 --> 1:04:32.687
What the fuck's wrong with you, Hank?

1:04:39.789 --> 1:04:42.744
Do you see this?
You see the way this boy drinks?

1:04:42.918 --> 1:04:45.456
You see Hank take a
drink of that whiskey?

1:04:45.750 --> 1:04:47.105
It's like... it's like...

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:50.407
Ha ha ha ha.

1:04:50.763 --> 1:04:54.547
Like... like in,
you know, like...

1:04:52.763 --> 1:04:56.547
Like some kind of commercial...
for preparation of the mouth?

1:04:57.184 --> 1:04:59.556
Like he lives on Primrose Lane?

1:05:00.605 --> 1:05:03.310
You look like some
goddamn bird or something.

1:05:04.108 --> 1:05:07.525
You gonna start playing big brother now,
teach me how to drink my whiskey?

1:05:11.950 --> 1:05:14.240
Did you ever see anybody
drink like that before?

1:05:14.787 --> 1:05:19.496
No, to tell you the truth, I don't believe
I've ever seen anybody drink like that before.

1:05:20.001 --> 1:05:24.047
I don't...
I don't drink like that.

1:05:22.412 --> 1:05:25.280
- My dad didn't drink like that.
- Uh-oh.

1:05:24.632 --> 1:05:27.419
You know, we don't have one thing
in common, me and him,

1:05:27.677 --> 1:05:29.752
except maybe our last name.

1:05:30.722 --> 1:05:32.382
You're more like a brother
to me than he is.

1:05:35.068 --> 1:05:36.615
Oh! Ha ha ha.

1:05:37.438 --> 1:05:39.596
Do... do him crossing the field.

1:05:40.608 --> 1:05:42.482
Ha ha ha ha. Do it!
He won't care.

1:05:42.652 --> 1:05:44.894
Come on, you don't care,
do you, Hank, huh?

1:05:46.698 --> 1:05:48.094
Crossing the field?

1:05:48.494 --> 1:05:49.902
Uh, crossing the field.

1:05:50.202 --> 1:05:53.653
Do like you did that night,
the snow, he had...

1:05:54.312 --> 1:05:56.680
It's just like, uh, say, what was it?
OK.

1:05:58.036 --> 1:05:59.500
And... and...
the way it starts out

1:05:59.537 --> 1:06:01.831
like he's walking across, like,
that fucking, like, uh,

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.713
like he's a quail or some shit.

1:06:05.636 --> 1:06:10.133
"Hey, guys, come on, you know...
Hey, wait up, wait up! Wait for me."

1:06:10.808 --> 1:06:13.382
"I... I...
I'm not dressed right."

1:06:12.451 --> 1:06:16.036
You're only wearing your
pissy little loafers, you know?

1:06:17.441 --> 1:06:21.522
Do him when the crow flies out
and pecks him in the head!

1:06:21.523 --> 1:06:22.649
That's good.

1:06:24.157 --> 1:06:25.984
No, that's fucked up.

1:06:25.308 --> 1:06:26.872
It's like...
That was like...

1:06:28.695 --> 1:06:29.954
You know...

1:06:29.955 --> 1:06:31.913
The fucking thing wasn't electric, shit.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.413
You know, we shouldn't
ever let him keep that money.

1:06:40.717 --> 1:06:44.845
No, I'm not shitting. We shouldn't...
we shouldn't have done that.

1:06:45.682 --> 1:06:48.302
We should have never let him keep
that money. Look how he's looking at us.

1:06:48.476 --> 1:06:50.599
It's like he's fucking better and everything.

1:06:51.271 --> 1:06:52.830
Like... like... like
you own us or something.

1:06:52.898 --> 1:06:55.602
I think we've all had too much to drink.
Let's call it a night.

1:06:55.776 --> 1:06:57.650
You're gonna keep the
money and shit, you know.

1:06:58.153 --> 1:06:59.352
Let's all go home.

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:01.500
That's what... that's what you
wanted, wasn't it, Hank?

1:07:01.550 --> 1:07:04.400
You wanted me to pick sides.
Isn't that what you said?

1:07:07.706 --> 1:07:09.102
What are you talking about?

1:07:11.410 --> 1:07:13.668
You know what...
You know what he's going to do?

1:07:13.838 --> 1:07:17.587
He's gonna crawl into Carl's office
like, on his belly like a fucking snake.

1:07:17.759 --> 1:07:19.170
He's gonna end up confessing.

1:07:19.344 --> 1:07:21.337
You know what, you're right.

1:07:21.375 --> 1:07:23.800
I bet you would rat on us just to
get off the hook, now, wouldn't ya?

1:07:23.849 --> 1:07:24.928
Take... take me home, man.
Let's go.

1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:27.770
I don't want to stay here.
I gotta get home.

1:07:27.937 --> 1:07:29.052
No, huh,
you know what? Wait.

1:07:29.230 --> 1:07:31.300
- Come on, take home.
- Uh, no!

1:07:31.368 --> 1:07:32.800
We got... we got
something else for you, Hank.

1:07:32.817 --> 1:07:35.902
I tell you what... Let's do this:
Let's do more playacting, ...

1:07:36.071 --> 1:07:38.823
and let's do it where he...
where Hank confesses, OK?...

1:07:39.700 --> 1:07:42.000
...to Carl, all right?
This is gonna be cool.

1:07:42.003 --> 1:07:44.000
You be... and you be Hank
and I'll be Carl.

1:07:44.081 --> 1:07:46.532
No, you do... you do it.
You go out and be Hank,

1:07:46.610 --> 1:07:48.658
- like you'd knock on Carl's door.
- I can't do anything like him.

1:07:48.836 --> 1:07:51.007
But when you're fucked up,
you're funny as shit.

1:07:51.020 --> 1:07:52.365
- Come on, do it.
- OK.

1:07:52.756 --> 1:07:56.007
And you're knocking on the door...
and I'm like sitting here doing paperwork

1:07:56.177 --> 1:07:58.799
and dumb ass comes in, OK?

1:07:59.014 --> 1:08:01.256
Dumb ass comes in with his
tail between his legs, OK?

1:08:01.559 --> 1:08:03.467
OK, here, I'm coming in.

1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:04.900
You ready?

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000
OK.

1:08:06.586 --> 1:08:07.628
Hello?

1:08:07.786 --> 1:08:08.828
Carl...

1:08:09.700 --> 1:08:11.281
It's Hank Mitchell.

1:08:12.112 --> 1:08:14.036
- Well, hey, Hank, how you doing?
- Hey, how you doing?

1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:15.000
Sit... sit down.

1:08:15.324 --> 1:08:16.901
I need to talk to you.

1:08:17.075 --> 1:08:18.784
Yeah, OK, what about?

1:08:20.204 --> 1:08:21.700
It's about Dwight Stephanson.

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:23.601
Yeah?

1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:26.372
He didn't die in an accident.

1:08:27.003 --> 1:08:28.796
What are you talking about?

1:08:29.215 --> 1:08:30.874
No, no, I killed him.

1:08:31.259 --> 1:08:34.010
- You killed Dwight Stephanson?
- That's right.

1:08:34.930 --> 1:08:37.088
I suffocated him with his own scarf,

1:08:37.265 --> 1:08:40.884
and then I just shoved him
off the bridge into Anders creek.

1:08:41.521 --> 1:08:44.687
I made it look like an accident.

1:08:45.066 --> 1:08:46.457
Well, why would you do
something like that?

1:08:46.595 --> 1:08:47.796
That... that's OK...

1:08:47.151 --> 1:08:51.481
4.5 million dollars is worth a hell of
a lot more to me than some old man's life.

1:08:51.656 --> 1:08:53.116
- All right, that's enough.
- No.

1:08:53.283 --> 1:08:55.193
I'm up to the part
where you're gonna agree

1:08:55.369 --> 1:08:57.956
to testify against us, OK?
Can I just do that? Come on...

1:08:58.163 --> 1:08:59.445
<i>I killed him.</i>

1:09:00.041 --> 1:09:02.414
<i>- You killed Dwight Stephanson?
- That's right.</i>

1:09:03.545 --> 1:09:05.871
<i>I suffocated him with his own scarf,</i>

1:09:06.048 --> 1:09:10.426
<i>and then I just shoved him off
the bridge into Anders creek.</i>

1:09:10.803 --> 1:09:11.834
You taped this?

1:09:13.806 --> 1:09:16.927
<i>I made it look like an accident.</i>

1:09:22.232 --> 1:09:23.941
Well, why would you do that, Hank?

1:09:24.235 --> 1:09:28.280
It's your confession. It's you saying
how you killed Dwight Stephanson.

1:09:28.698 --> 1:09:31.071
Nobody's going to believe that.

1:09:32.410 --> 1:09:35.285
I mean... I mean, it's obvious I'm just
kidding around on there, isn't it, Jacob?

1:09:35.355 --> 1:09:40.043
Why... why would anybody believe it?
I mean, let's just think about this.

1:09:40.212 --> 1:09:43.296
If... if you and I both go into
Carl's office tomorrow afternoon

1:09:43.305 --> 1:09:45.600
and we both claim the other one
killed Dwight Stephanson...

1:09:45.642 --> 1:09:48.200
Who... who do you think he's
gonna believe, huh? You?

1:09:48.262 --> 1:09:50.670
A 40-year-old unemployed
high school dropout,

1:09:50.848 --> 1:09:53.387
who's proud when people call
him the town drunk, or me?

1:09:54.102 --> 1:09:55.762
I've got a job.

1:09:56.145 --> 1:09:58.324
I don't get drunk
and... and... and...

1:09:58.607 --> 1:10:01.312
and scream obscenities
at my wife in public.

1:10:01.485 --> 1:10:04.238
I don't pass out on
other people's doorways.

1:10:05.782 --> 1:10:07.027
I wonder who he's gonna believe?

1:10:07.494 --> 1:10:08.783
Yeah.

1:10:09.494 --> 1:10:11.783
Now we're all back
in the same boat again.

1:10:11.784 --> 1:10:13.786
Isn't that right, Jacob?

1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:18.952
You seem to have forgotten
we're all in this together.

1:10:19.797 --> 1:10:21.200
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's all...

1:10:21.296 --> 1:10:22.547
- That's all it is, Lou.
- That's all it is.

1:10:22.717 --> 1:10:25.553
You know, it's not to hurt you.
That... that's what Hank said.

1:10:26.054 --> 1:10:28.213
- It's just so you don't hurt him.
- That's right.

1:10:28.259 --> 1:10:29.740
And... and... and
it's like...

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.684
It's just in case you confess or...

1:10:32.854 --> 1:10:34.432
Wait a minute.

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:39.985
Are you... are you telling me
you knew about this, Jacob?

1:10:40.404 --> 1:10:41.436
Take it easy.

1:10:41.614 --> 1:10:44.699
- You saying you knew about this?
- He isn't going to use it, unless, uh...

1:10:45.035 --> 1:10:47.442
Is that what...
Is that what you're saying here, Jacob?

1:10:48.455 --> 1:10:50.780
That... that... that
you two worked together?

1:10:51.124 --> 1:10:54.079
I... he said he'd help me
buy back the farm, Lou.

1:10:54.532 --> 1:10:55.679
Oh!

1:10:55.732 --> 1:10:56.879
Oh! Ha ha ha.

1:10:59.259 --> 1:11:00.919
So that's cool, right?

1:11:01.260 --> 1:11:03.586
- Hey, Lou, please don't be pissed off.
- Come on, let's go.

1:11:03.764 --> 1:11:06.136
You know, he was...
We were just gonna...

1:11:06.593 --> 1:11:08.361
He'll cool down, Hank.

1:11:08.521 --> 1:11:10.470
Move, move, move!
Let's go.

1:11:10.521 --> 1:11:11.470
Don't move!

1:11:12.816 --> 1:11:15.272
- What the hell are you doing?
- You give me that tape!

1:11:15.444 --> 1:11:17.021
Goddamn, put down the gun!

1:11:17.279 --> 1:11:19.438
No! No, you're not leaving here
until I get that fucking tape!

1:11:19.907 --> 1:11:21.965
OK, just settle down.

1:11:22.035 --> 1:11:25.435
- Hey, Lou, leave him alone.
- Or what?

1:11:25.606 --> 1:11:27.779
What, are you gonna shoot me,
Jake, huh?

1:11:27.999 --> 1:11:29.411
Just leave...
just leave him alone.

1:11:29.585 --> 1:11:32.354
No, you stabbed me in the back,
right here in my own house!

1:11:32.479 --> 1:11:33.526
Lou?

1:11:33.589 --> 1:11:34.689
What's going on?

1:11:34.851 --> 1:11:36.149
Come on, Lou, please!

1:11:36.254 --> 1:11:37.675
You know I need that money.

1:11:37.969 --> 1:11:39.132
Please, Lou, leave him alone.

1:11:39.304 --> 1:11:41.750
No, let me do it!
I need it tomorrow.

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:44.334
You know, they're gonna...
They're gonna take my truck.

1:11:44.434 --> 1:11:46.143
Put the gun... put
the gun down, Lou!

1:11:46.312 --> 1:11:48.185
You said he's got a job.
It's you and me, buddy.

1:11:48.355 --> 1:11:50.349
We're the ones...
We're the ones who needs it.

1:11:50.733 --> 1:11:52.275
- He just wants it!
- OK, OK.

1:11:52.287 --> 1:11:56.811
- Oh, Lou, put it down.
- No! Now, shut up!

1:11:56.957 --> 1:11:59.748
Please, Lou, come on, man,
Lou, please, don't do that.

1:11:59.827 --> 1:12:01.838
Do you think he's your friend, huh?

1:12:01.845 --> 1:12:03.372
Lou, put it down!

1:12:03.373 --> 1:12:06.001
He doesn't give a fuck about you, do ya?

1:12:06.109 --> 1:12:08.535
Come on, Lou, let's all settle down.
We'll talk it through.

1:12:11.228 --> 1:12:12.375
Jesus!

1:12:12.591 --> 1:12:15.545
That was an "insinuation".

1:12:16.053 --> 1:12:17.334
Lou, for God's sakes.

1:12:17.514 --> 1:12:18.462
Put the gun down, baby!

1:12:19.256 --> 1:12:20.611
Lou!

1:12:21.268 --> 1:12:23.992
This...
This is the real thing.

1:12:24.136 --> 1:12:26.679
Lou, no!
No, Lou, don't it!

1:12:26.733 --> 1:12:27.978
Put it down!

1:12:32.059 --> 1:12:33.402
Aah!

1:12:34.009 --> 1:12:35.702
Oh, God!

1:12:42.399 --> 1:12:43.746
Oh, my baby!

1:12:49.194 --> 1:12:51.658
Oh, my baby!
Oh, my baby!

1:12:52.019 --> 1:12:54.758
Hank, please stay
out here and talk to me.

1:12:53.898 --> 1:12:55.097
Don't... don't...

1:12:55.098 --> 1:12:56.805
Tell me what's going on, Hank?

1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:01.434
It's OK, Nancy.

1:13:01.605 --> 1:13:03.700
Call 911! Call the cops!

1:13:03.732 --> 1:13:07.980
I'll call 911, but we got to decide...
We got to decide what we're gonna say.

1:13:08.154 --> 1:13:10.300
You saw what happened.
It was an accident.

1:13:10.380 --> 1:13:13.191
- You killed him.
- He got drunk, he went crazy.

1:13:13.227 --> 1:13:15.393
- You killed him for the money!
- You can have his share.

1:13:15.591 --> 1:13:17.006
You can have it.

1:13:17.391 --> 1:13:20.606
You fucking think I like just money?!

1:13:22.128 --> 1:13:24.168
- You stay out!
- Settle down.

1:13:25.549 --> 1:13:26.462
Stop it!

1:13:29.261 --> 1:13:31.419
What are you doing?
Stop it!

1:13:32.858 --> 1:13:34.092
Take it easy, Nancy.

1:13:34.850 --> 1:13:36.205
Oh, my God!

1:13:36.394 --> 1:13:38.219
No. No,
I wasn't going to...

1:13:38.522 --> 1:13:41.716
No, no, no, no, I'm not
gonna... I wasn't gonna... no...

1:13:41.725 --> 1:13:43.600
You saw what happened.
It was self-defense.

1:13:43.783 --> 1:13:44.930
No, wait!

1:13:46.948 --> 1:13:49.618
Let's just talk, ok?
Figure this out?

1:13:49.829 --> 1:13:52.185
Come on, we gotta, OK?

1:13:52.695 --> 1:13:53.652
Aah!

1:13:53.653 --> 1:13:54.694
No!

1:14:13.181 --> 1:14:14.224
Hank.

1:15:03.910 --> 1:15:06.317
Hello, yes. There...
There's been a shooting.

1:15:08.707 --> 1:15:11.245
H-Hank Mitchell.
I'm at Lou Chambers' place,

1:15:11.418 --> 1:15:14.336
County Road 27,
just past the burnt road.

1:15:16.382 --> 1:15:18.956
They're both...
They're both dead!

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.543
Oh, God, please hurry!

1:16:07.426 --> 1:16:08.569
Jacob?

1:16:10.999 --> 1:16:12.122
Jacob?

1:16:19.662 --> 1:16:21.120
Hey, what are you doing?

1:16:21.624 --> 1:16:23.284
Huh?

1:16:23.624 --> 1:16:25.284
What, are you going to be OK?

1:16:27.629 --> 1:16:30.464
Come on, we can make this work.
We don't have much time.

1:16:36.556 --> 1:16:39.177
Now, listen to what I have to say
very carefully, OK?

1:16:40.936 --> 1:16:42.763
They were fighting, OK?

1:16:43.063 --> 1:16:47.809
They were both drunk.
And Lou started pushing Nancy around.

1:16:48.527 --> 1:16:53.025
When we tried to stop him, he got really
pissed off and he grabbed his shotgun.

1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:55.572
And she ran in the kitchen
and got her pistol.

1:16:56.161 --> 1:16:58.783
You ran out to your truck
and got your rifle,

1:16:58.997 --> 1:17:02.782
but by the time we got back to the house,
it was too late. He'd already shot her.

1:17:04.212 --> 1:17:08.210
He was shooting up the whole place.
The ceilings, the walls, everything.

1:17:08.383 --> 1:17:11.800
When we stepped in the doorway,
he shot at me, but he missed.

1:17:12.137 --> 1:17:14.593
So he aimed the shotgun at my chest,

1:17:15.308 --> 1:17:17.597
and just before he pulled the trigger...

1:17:18.269 --> 1:17:19.550
you killed him.

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:23.147
You saved my life.

1:17:24.777 --> 1:17:25.975
See?

1:17:26.945 --> 1:17:28.440
It was self-defense.

1:17:30.826 --> 1:17:32.201
Come on, Jacob.

1:17:33.661 --> 1:17:35.868
I need to hear you say it.

1:17:43.589 --> 1:17:45.049
They were fighting.

1:17:48.387 --> 1:17:50.593
Lou got really mad.

1:17:51.098 --> 1:17:54.052
He shot the walls, he shot the ceiling.

1:17:55.687 --> 1:17:57.430
Then what did we do?

1:17:59.065 --> 1:18:00.974
We ran out to the truck.

1:18:01.235 --> 1:18:04.458
You ran outside with Jacob,
'cause, uh...

1:18:04.556 --> 1:18:11.284
Jacob said, uh... he ran out to get
his rifle on his own. He said, uh...

1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:13.500
See, he said, uh...

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:17.411
"Lou ran you out of the house
after he shot Nancy."

1:18:18.588 --> 1:18:19.936
Jacob said that?

1:18:23.381 --> 1:18:24.424
Huh...

1:18:31.226 --> 1:18:33.054
Well, I suppose...

1:18:34.814 --> 1:18:36.854
I can see how it might've seemed
that way to him.

1:18:42.072 --> 1:18:43.483
Because...

1:18:45.660 --> 1:18:47.652
he did... he did go out
to the truck alone.

1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:52.115
I followed him, but...

1:18:53.335 --> 1:18:55.208
then, when I heard the shot...

1:18:56.797 --> 1:18:58.588
and Nancy got killed...

1:18:59.384 --> 1:19:01.709
I turned back toward the house...

1:19:02.178 --> 1:19:06.888
I was on the porch
wh-when Lou started outside...

1:19:07.684 --> 1:19:11.220
And that's when I turned
to run out into the yard.

1:19:13.358 --> 1:19:14.389
So...

1:19:17.070 --> 1:19:18.445
I guess...

1:19:19.907 --> 1:19:23.952
I... I can see how it might've seemed that
way to Jacob, that I was running outside.

1:19:28.433 --> 1:19:29.475
Yeah.

1:19:34.173 --> 1:19:38.918
Go home, Hank. We'll, uh...
I think we got what we need for right now.

1:19:40.054 --> 1:19:42.343
- "May they rest in peace."
- May they rest in peace.

1:19:43.016 --> 1:19:45.500
"And may their souls and the souls"

1:19:45.519 --> 1:19:49.000
"of all the faithful departed, through
the mercy of God, rest in peace."

1:19:50.253 --> 1:19:51.604
- Amen.
- Amen.

1:19:51.751 --> 1:19:53.875
In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy spirit...

1:20:05.994 --> 1:20:07.193
Hey.

1:21:16.205 --> 1:21:17.782
Oh, I think the little
baby's ready to come out.

1:21:17.956 --> 1:21:19.581
Maybe she's getting a little cold.

1:21:20.701 --> 1:21:23.778
Whoa...
Yeah...

1:21:24.795 --> 1:21:25.733
Shh...

1:21:30.890 --> 1:21:32.800
Shh...

1:21:32.890 --> 1:21:35.096
- Who could that be?
- I don't know.

1:21:38.980 --> 1:21:40.309
It's Carl.

1:21:51.538 --> 1:21:53.537
Hey, Carl.

1:21:53.538 --> 1:21:56.373
I hope I didn't wake you, Hank.
I saw a light was still on.

1:21:56.541 --> 1:22:00.076
Oh, no, no. Just, you know,
getting ready for bed.

1:22:03.633 --> 1:22:06.302
I hate like hell to have
to do this to you, Hank.

1:22:10.225 --> 1:22:13.597
I was, uh... driving out by
Lou Chambers' place, and, uh...

1:22:14.312 --> 1:22:17.895
I saw your brother's truck parked
out in the middle of the road.

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:20.059
I could barely squeeze around it.

1:22:20.903 --> 1:22:22.811
I found him inside the house
passed out in an armchair.

1:22:25.032 --> 1:22:27.606
Oh. I appreciate
you bringing him here.

1:22:28.369 --> 1:22:30.611
I... I mean, I hope
it wasn't too much...

1:22:31.957 --> 1:22:36.251
I know you guys had a real rough time.
Just... have a talk with him, ok?

1:22:36.420 --> 1:22:38.828
And I'll try to keep an eye on him, too.

1:22:40.507 --> 1:22:43.509
Come on, what the hell
were you thinking about, huh?

1:22:43.803 --> 1:22:46.377
That's the last place in the world
you oughta be.

1:22:48.267 --> 1:22:52.479
God, I just about had a heart attack
when Carl knocked on the door.

1:22:54.941 --> 1:22:56.732
We gotta be careful.

1:22:58.236 --> 1:23:00.028
Can't take any chances.

1:23:05.995 --> 1:23:07.200
Get yourself over.

1:23:07.219 --> 1:23:08.470
There we go.

1:23:12.336 --> 1:23:13.498
Comfortable?

1:23:15.381 --> 1:23:18.964
Only I don't think I should be here
in the baby's room. It's... it's clean in here.

1:23:19.677 --> 1:23:22.465
What? It's OK.
The baby sleeps with us.

1:23:24.307 --> 1:23:25.802
Hey, you remember this?

1:23:26.435 --> 1:23:28.676
Everything goes to sleep.

1:23:30.022 --> 1:23:33.720
Your head goes to sleep.
Remember when dad used to do that?

1:23:33.752 --> 1:23:35.420
Your head goes to sleep.

1:23:35.421 --> 1:23:37.475
Your shoulders go to sleep.

1:23:37.505 --> 1:23:38.965
Your arms go to sleep.

1:23:39.324 --> 1:23:41.281
Your back goes to sleep.

1:23:41.743 --> 1:23:43.783
Hank, do you ever feel evil?

1:23:52.505 --> 1:23:53.668
I do.

1:23:55.383 --> 1:23:56.962
I feel evil.

1:24:23.123 --> 1:24:25.994
You know, maybe I can get
a family of my own now.

1:24:26.877 --> 1:24:28.752
I mean, with the money and all.

1:24:35.554 --> 1:24:38.306
Why? Don't you think somebody
would marry me if I'm rich?

1:24:39.058 --> 1:24:40.172
You don't need money for that.

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000
Hank.

1:24:43.229 --> 1:24:47.393
Hey, come on.
What about... What was her name?

1:24:47.568 --> 1:24:48.784
Carrie Richards?

1:24:49.862 --> 1:24:52.400
She liked you even though
you were broke-dick.

1:24:55.994 --> 1:24:59.079
Oh, her. Yeah.
That was a whole different deal.

1:24:59.184 --> 1:25:00.225
That was...

1:25:00.373 --> 1:25:03.992
Her... her friends, they pitched in
100 bucks altogether

1:25:04.211 --> 1:25:07.415
and betted her that she wouldn't
go steady with me for a month.

1:25:13.722 --> 1:25:15.265
Jesus, Jacob.

1:25:19.145 --> 1:25:21.018
I thought you guys had a thing.

1:25:26.914 --> 1:25:28.165
I don't know. It...

1:25:28.489 --> 1:25:30.197
It weren't that bad.

1:25:32.911 --> 1:25:35.449
I mean, actually,
it was kind of cool.

1:25:35.789 --> 1:25:40.451
We used to walk around
together a lot, you know.

1:25:38.624 --> 1:25:39.875
Take walks, you know?

1:25:43.089 --> 1:25:45.627
And, uh, we talked about
all kinda cool stuff.

1:25:47.010 --> 1:25:51.090
I held hands with her one time.
We were walking around,

1:25:51.264 --> 1:25:54.799
but my hand sweated so much
she kinda had to let it go.

1:25:56.187 --> 1:25:57.978
I was nervous, I guess.

1:25:59.190 --> 1:26:03.058
But it was cool.
When the month was over, she, uh...

1:26:03.653 --> 1:26:08.529
You know, kinda would say hi to me
sometimes in the hallway when I'd see her.

1:26:10.495 --> 1:26:11.739
She didn't have to do that.

1:26:12.371 --> 1:26:13.866
That was cool of her.

1:26:18.044 --> 1:26:22.292
God, Hank, you know, I've never...
I've never even kissed a girl before.

1:26:27.848 --> 1:26:33.000
And you know what? If being rich will
change that, I'm all for it. I don't care.

1:26:33.688 --> 1:26:37.389
I just wanna feel it, you know? I just wanna
know what people do, you know?

1:26:37.567 --> 1:26:40.687
I don't care if it's 'cause of the money.

1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:57.294
Hank?
I'm gonna be happy now, right?

1:26:58.882 --> 1:27:00.210
Sure you are.

1:27:00.802 --> 1:27:02.130
We all are.

1:27:04.848 --> 1:27:06.591
Yeah, that's right.
We all are.

1:27:07.934 --> 1:27:11.600
You know what? I'm gonna, you know,
buy back the farm, you know?

1:27:12.022 --> 1:27:15.723
And have, uh... And have a lot of kids,
'cause I'll meet this nice girl

1:27:15.901 --> 1:27:18.689
and she'll be really cool to me
and be really nice.

1:27:18.863 --> 1:27:21.734
Just normal,
a normal woman, you know.

1:27:23.785 --> 1:27:27.783
And, uh... And then you and Sarah
will come over and bring Amanda,

1:27:28.291 --> 1:27:30.828
and we'll all sit around
and tell stories and stuff.

1:27:31.001 --> 1:27:34.870
We'll drink on the porch
like dad and Uncle Ted used to do.

1:27:35.018 --> 1:27:36.860
- You know?
- Yeah.

1:28:03.539 --> 1:28:05.532
He nod off on you, Jack?

1:28:06.763 --> 1:28:07.910
Hey, Carl.

1:28:26.648 --> 1:28:29.436
Gettin' a bit thin
up top there, Hank.

1:28:32.446 --> 1:28:34.522
Don't you have any crimes to solve?

1:28:34.699 --> 1:28:35.778
Maybe.

1:28:37.118 --> 1:28:40.570
Think you could track down Jacob,
bring him by my office tomorrow afternoon?

1:28:40.747 --> 1:28:42.870
Sure. What for?

1:28:43.667 --> 1:28:46.585
Man from the FBI's gonna
be driving through.

1:28:47.088 --> 1:28:49.625
Thought you two might
be able to help him out.

1:28:50.300 --> 1:28:52.506
Seems they're looking for a lost plane.

1:28:52.507 --> 1:28:53.363
Huh.

1:28:57.141 --> 1:28:59.632
- See ya about 3:00.
- You bet.

1:29:09.279 --> 1:29:11.000
Maybe we should just leave.

1:29:11.051 --> 1:29:13.881
Take the money and the baby
and just leave the country.

1:29:13.993 --> 1:29:15.404
Stop it, Hank!

1:29:15.703 --> 1:29:18.373
You'll go in there
and you'll see what he knows.

1:29:18.623 --> 1:29:20.527
If anything looks bad,
we can always move the money.

1:29:20.538 --> 1:29:24.400
- It's still the only thing tying us to anything.
- The connections are just under the surface!

1:29:24.714 --> 1:29:28.000
Sarah, I mean, think about it.
It wouldn't be that hard

1:29:28.176 --> 1:29:30.666
for somebody to just put it all together.

1:29:31.304 --> 1:29:33.877
There's the plane and...
and Stephanson.

1:29:34.057 --> 1:29:35.256
There's Lou and Nancy.

1:29:35.434 --> 1:29:37.473
You've gotta remember how people see you.

1:29:37.645 --> 1:29:39.518
You're just a normal guy,
a nice, sweet, normal guy.

1:29:39.688 --> 1:29:42.262
- They're gonna know!
- No, they won't!

1:29:43.526 --> 1:29:47.026
Nobody would ever believe that you'd
be capable of doing what you've done.

1:29:54.330 --> 1:29:57.781
Well, it was snowin' pretty hard,
so we're not really sure,

1:29:57.959 --> 1:30:01.162
but it sounded kinda like
an engine cuttin' on and off.

1:30:01.714 --> 1:30:05.000
But that was it.
We didn't hear anything more.

1:30:05.635 --> 1:30:08.969
No... No crash.
No engine. Nothing.

1:30:13.268 --> 1:30:14.513
Anything you want to add to that, Jacob?

1:30:18.610 --> 1:30:20.188
No.

1:30:20.610 --> 1:30:22.188
I can't think of anything.

1:30:22.362 --> 1:30:23.737
That's about it.

1:30:24.447 --> 1:30:26.986
It was probably
a snowmobile or something.

1:30:26.987 --> 1:30:27.813
You know?

1:30:41.133 --> 1:30:41.963
Well, guess that's it, guys.

1:30:43.177 --> 1:30:45.300
- Thanks for comin'.
- My pleasure, Carl.

1:30:45.189 --> 1:30:45.919
Good to see you, Carl.

1:30:46.306 --> 1:30:48.547
- Nice to have met you.
- I'll talk to you later.

1:30:52.604 --> 1:30:54.680
Do you think you could
take us out there?

1:30:57.943 --> 1:30:59.318
To the nature preserve?

1:30:59.738 --> 1:31:02.608
Have to go in the morning, I guess,
after the storm passes.

1:31:05.618 --> 1:31:07.030
C-can you tell us what
this is all about?

1:31:08.830 --> 1:31:10.325
Lookin' for a plane.

1:31:11.751 --> 1:31:13.625
There's no way
it's from the armored car robbery.

1:31:13.795 --> 1:31:17.544
This isn't a guess, honey.
The guy from the FBI told me.

1:31:19.467 --> 1:31:21.295
It doesn't make sense.

1:31:22.387 --> 1:31:23.882
The kidnapping made sense.

1:31:24.140 --> 1:31:25.631
He's looking for a plane full of money.

1:31:25.650 --> 1:31:27.600
I mean, how many of those
can there be around here?

1:31:27.770 --> 1:31:29.704
It was hundred-dollar bills, Hank.

1:31:29.750 --> 1:31:31.842
If it was an armored car robbery,
there'd be other denominations.

1:31:31.983 --> 1:31:34.182
There'd be 50s and 20s and 10s.

1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:38.773
Well, congratulations, Sarah.
I guess you know more than the FBI.

1:31:45.062 --> 1:31:46.105
Hank?

1:31:49.043 --> 1:31:50.835
Did he show you his badge?

1:31:51.379 --> 1:31:52.754
Why would he show me his badge?

1:31:53.506 --> 1:31:54.420
Wait.

1:32:05.645 --> 1:32:06.890
It's him, isn't it?

1:32:10.692 --> 1:32:14.524
It's the older one... Vernon.
He's looking for his brother.

1:32:14.697 --> 1:32:16.239
I guy I met today was skinnier.

1:32:16.657 --> 1:32:18.235
He didn't have a beard.

1:32:18.410 --> 1:32:20.900
Well, maybe he lost weight.
Maybe he shaved.

1:32:21.496 --> 1:32:24.283
Well, that doesn't make
a difference, does it?

1:32:24.834 --> 1:32:27.668
I mean, no matter who he is,
I still have to take him to the plane.

1:32:28.671 --> 1:32:30.248
Well, if we think it's him,
you shouldn't go.

1:32:31.090 --> 1:32:31.837
Why not?

1:32:32.217 --> 1:32:36.464
Because he's gonna shoot all 3 of you, Hank.
As soon as he sees the plane.

1:32:37.264 --> 1:32:39.304
That's why he wants you to go,
so he can get rid of the witnesses.

1:32:39.934 --> 1:32:42.342
But if he's really from the FBI,

1:32:42.729 --> 1:32:45.481
and I don't show up,
it's gonna look suspicious as hell.

1:32:50.112 --> 1:32:53.232
I'll call the FBI in the morning.
I'll ask for an agent Baxter.

1:32:53.407 --> 1:32:56.409
That won't work. I'm meeting him at 9:00.
They won't be open before that.

1:32:56.577 --> 1:32:59.034
You can stall them for a bit.

1:33:00.165 --> 1:33:03.949
And, uh, I'll call from here,
and then I'll call you at Carl's office.

1:33:04.461 --> 1:33:06.703
- And what if there's no agent Baxter?
- Then what?

1:33:06.881 --> 1:33:11.792
Well, then you won't go.
You can tell Carl that the baby's sick

1:33:13.305 --> 1:33:15.178
and... and that you have to come home.

1:33:15.390 --> 1:33:16.849
What about Jacob?

1:33:18.101 --> 1:33:20.593
Say he's hung over.
Carl would believe that.

1:33:21.147 --> 1:33:23.685
Whoever the guy is,
you don't want Jacob there.

1:33:25.610 --> 1:33:27.437
It sounds like a B.S. excuse.

1:33:27.612 --> 1:33:29.272
- Hank, what do you want?
- Well...

1:33:30.115 --> 1:33:33.283
Do you want to just walk out there
and get shot by this guy?

1:33:33.453 --> 1:33:35.575
No, I don't wanna walk out
there and get shot!

1:33:35.871 --> 1:33:38.078
- Well, I'm trying to come up with a plan.
- A plan?

1:33:38.875 --> 1:33:43.495
Like the one to take the money back to
the plane, and we end up killing Stephanson?

1:33:43.964 --> 1:33:47.630
Or maybe the one where we tape Lou,
and 2 more people end up dead.

1:33:47.885 --> 1:33:50.377
Is that the sort of plan
you're thinking of?

1:33:50.847 --> 1:33:52.258
Well, I've got a plan!

1:33:53.057 --> 1:33:56.261
I'm taking the money back right now...
All of it.

1:33:56.285 --> 1:33:57.285
- Hank.
- No!

1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:01.941
I'm gonna put it back, and everything's
gonna be just like it used to be.

1:34:02.943 --> 1:34:05.731
That money, goddamn it!
Fuckin' money!

1:34:05.905 --> 1:34:08.527
Is that what you think?
Is that what you think you want?

1:34:08.825 --> 1:34:11.198
Walking off to the feed store
every morning for the next 30 years,

1:34:11.370 --> 1:34:16.198
waiting for tom Butler to retire or die
so you can finally get a raise?

1:34:16.709 --> 1:34:18.418
And what about Amanda?

1:34:18.586 --> 1:34:21.790
Do you think she's gonna like growing up
in somebody else's hand-me-down clothes?

1:34:22.132 --> 1:34:24.837
Playing with some kid's old toys
because we can never afford

1:34:25.011 --> 1:34:26.718
to buy her anything new?

1:34:26.887 --> 1:34:28.299
Don't say any more.

1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:29.837
And me...

1:34:32.143 --> 1:34:33.637
What about me?

1:34:38.526 --> 1:34:42.987
Spending the rest of my life, 8 hours a day,
with a fake smile plastered on my face

1:34:43.573 --> 1:34:45.447
checking out books.

1:34:45.826 --> 1:34:48.661
And then coming home
to cook dinner for you...

1:34:48.829 --> 1:34:53.538
The same meals over and over again,
whatever the week's coupons will allow.

1:34:54.460 --> 1:34:58.292
Only going out to restaurants
for special occasions...

1:34:58.465 --> 1:35:01.549
Birthdays or anniversaries. And even
then having to watch what we order...

1:35:01.718 --> 1:35:05.218
Skipping the appetizer,
coming home for dessert.

1:35:05.390 --> 1:35:07.216
You think that's gonna make me happy?

1:35:07.683 --> 1:35:10.720
- That's enough.
- No, no. I haven't done Jacob yet.

1:35:11.187 --> 1:35:13.476
It's back to the welfare office for Jacob.

1:35:13.648 --> 1:35:15.689
The occasional odd job.

1:35:16.026 --> 1:35:17.935
But with Lou gone now...

1:35:19.030 --> 1:35:22.649
Just himself and his dog all alone in that filthy
apartment. How long do you give him, Hank?

1:35:22.826 --> 1:35:24.106
Stop it!

1:35:27.914 --> 1:35:29.326
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?

1:35:30.251 --> 1:35:31.958
Everything just like it used to be.

1:35:42.389 --> 1:35:43.504
<i>Federal bureau of investigation.</i>

1:35:44.225 --> 1:35:46.384
I would like to speak to...

1:35:47.061 --> 1:35:49.979
Is there an agent Neil Baxter there?

1:35:51.691 --> 1:35:53.022
Well, if Jacob can't make it,

1:35:53.071 --> 1:35:56.260
that just leaves more of Linda's
homemade breakfast treats to go around.

1:35:56.350 --> 1:35:58.350
Hank, go ahead.
Have one of those.

1:35:58.741 --> 1:36:00.284
Help yourself.

1:36:00.535 --> 1:36:04.615
That's her own special creation there...
Deep-fried dietetic donuts...

1:36:06.583 --> 1:36:10.285
And so inedible, you won't be able
to get enough of it down to be bad for you.

1:36:13.051 --> 1:36:17.756
Hey, this guy, uh... You know, this guy Baxter,
he showed you his badge or anything?

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:19.344
Badge?

1:36:20.014 --> 1:36:23.348
Yeah. This is kinda stupid,
but, you know, I always wondered

1:36:23.518 --> 1:36:25.013
if they look like
they do in the movies.

1:36:25.187 --> 1:36:26.385
Yeah? How's that?

1:36:27.004 --> 1:36:31.000
Well, you know, kinda
bright and silver with a big "FBI"

1:36:31.029 --> 1:36:32.193
stamped across the center.

1:36:33.029 --> 1:36:34.193
Not really.

1:36:34.407 --> 1:36:35.402
He showed you his?

1:36:35.991 --> 1:36:38.364
Well, no,
but I've seen them before.

1:36:42.290 --> 1:36:43.784
I wonder where he is.

1:36:43.958 --> 1:36:47.244
Well, you know, I bet he'd show it to you
if you just ask him that.

1:36:50.466 --> 1:36:54.001
Hell, he might even let you hold his gun
if you ask him real nice.

1:36:58.809 --> 1:37:00.174
You know what, later on,

1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:04.951
I could take you for a ride in my truck
and make the lights flash for you.

1:37:05.552 --> 1:37:06.352
Yeah?

1:37:06.450 --> 1:37:07.420
<i>- Carl?</i>
- Yes.

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:10.405
<i>It's Sarah. Hi.
I'm looking for Hank. Is he there?</i>

1:37:10.572 --> 1:37:11.652
Yes, ma'am.
You found him.

1:37:11.824 --> 1:37:15.110
He's standing right here.
He's trying to avoid eating

1:37:15.286 --> 1:37:18.371
one of my wife's homemade donuts.
How's the baby?

1:37:18.915 --> 1:37:22.035
<i>She's not doing so good. That's part
of what I'm calling to tell him about.</i>

1:37:23.378 --> 1:37:24.837
I'm sorry to hear...

1:37:25.297 --> 1:37:28.247
Well, you probably better
tell him that yourself, OK?

1:37:28.408 --> 1:37:29.400
All right. You take care.

1:37:29.427 --> 1:37:30.340
That's your wife.

1:37:31.208 --> 1:37:32.200
Hi, honey.

1:37:32.275 --> 1:37:33.955
<i>- It's him.</i>
- What?

1:37:34.974 --> 1:37:36.679
<i>It's him, Hank.
Come home.</i>

1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.280
<i>You gotta get out of there.</i>

1:37:40.416 --> 1:37:42.188
<i>Hank?</i>

1:37:43.317 --> 1:37:44.776
I gotta stay.

1:37:45.194 --> 1:37:46.774
<i>What do you mean you gotta stay?</i>

1:37:46.850 --> 1:37:49.553
<i>We agreed that if I called you,
that you were gonna come home.</i>

1:37:50.117 --> 1:37:51.575
What about Carl?

1:37:53.245 --> 1:37:56.994
<i>I don't know. Tell Carl...
Tell him to give the guy the directions</i>

1:37:57.166 --> 1:37:59.622
<i>and that you two will meet him there later...</i>

1:38:00.128 --> 1:38:01.373
Everybody ready to roll?

1:38:01.671 --> 1:38:03.878
<i>Hank, he's gonna...
He's gonna shoot you both.</i>

1:38:04.049 --> 1:38:05.459
Ready to roll.

1:38:07.189 --> 1:38:08.231
<i>Hank?</i>

1:38:08.389 --> 1:38:09.431
Yeah.

1:38:11.899 --> 1:38:13.776
<i>Hank?</i>

1:38:16.187 --> 1:38:18.643
Well, they're waiting
for me, baby. I gotta go.

1:38:18.755 --> 1:38:20.699
- Carl, how you doin'?
- Good morning. How'd you sleep?

1:38:20.943 --> 1:38:22.500
<i>You come home, OK? Please, baby.</i>

1:38:22.557 --> 1:38:23.516
Sarah.

1:38:24.201 --> 1:38:25.197
OK.

1:38:25.198 --> 1:38:25.979
<i>Wait, Hank!</i>

1:38:26.157 --> 1:38:27.568
Yeah, I'll see you then.

1:38:27.762 --> 1:38:31.300
Ok. Yeah. Yeah,
I'll see you then.

1:38:31.362 --> 1:38:33.271
<i>God damn it! Don't!</i>

1:38:33.415 --> 1:38:34.791
I love you, too.

1:38:35.722 --> 1:38:36.973
<i>Wait! Hank?</i>

1:38:39.630 --> 1:38:40.662
Everything OK?

1:38:41.091 --> 1:38:45.670
Oh, yeah. You know, just, uh...
Some confusion about this evening's plans.

1:38:45.888 --> 1:38:46.717
Where's your brother?

1:38:47.558 --> 1:38:50.426
Oh, uh, Jacob won't be
joining us this morning.

1:38:50.514 --> 1:38:53.182
It seems he tied one on
again last night.

1:38:53.981 --> 1:38:56.650
- Ready when you are, Hank.
- Good. Let's go.

1:39:02.077 --> 1:39:03.641
Oh, no. You
should've asked me.

1:39:04.953 --> 1:39:06.900
Oh, hey.

1:39:06.953 --> 1:39:08.993
I forgot my hat.
I'll catch up with you guys.

1:39:09.164 --> 1:39:11.406
Well, go get it.
It's cold out there.

1:39:12.573 --> 1:39:14.563
You saw that truck right
around the corner, didn't you?

1:39:45.654 --> 1:39:47.218
Shit.

1:41:10.467 --> 1:41:13.137
Oh, this is the place, Hank.
I'm pretty sure of it.

1:41:13.304 --> 1:41:16.800
Look. Right there
is that, uh, nature preserve sign.

1:41:16.850 --> 1:41:18.924
That's where you guys were.

1:41:18.351 --> 1:41:21.500
I guess you're right, but I thought
it was a little further down,

1:41:21.582 --> 1:41:22.900
just, you know...

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:26.523
And, you know, if it was off over on
that side, that's farmland over there.

1:41:26.694 --> 1:41:28.604
Those farmers probably
would have found it by now.

1:41:28.780 --> 1:41:31.022
The best bet's gotta be over
here in the nature preserve.

1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:35.067
So I think the best idea is each of us take
a different section of the woods...

1:41:35.704 --> 1:41:39.537
Oh, good for Jacob.
This will make things go faster.

1:41:44.088 --> 1:41:45.667
Bring your rifle!

1:41:48.386 --> 1:41:50.627
We'll take a different section of the woods.

1:41:50.804 --> 1:41:53.759
If you or I find it, Baxter, we'll just
fire a couple of shots into the air.

1:41:55.894 --> 1:41:58.931
And, uh, Hank, here, you take that whistle.
And if you find it, just blow it loud as you can.

1:41:59.106 --> 1:42:00.897
We'll all come running.

1:42:12.496 --> 1:42:13.776
I thought you weren't up for this.

1:42:14.456 --> 1:42:15.619
I talked to Sarah.

1:42:18.127 --> 1:42:19.752
Well, I got up, and I felt better.

1:42:20.129 --> 1:42:22.003
You're right. You don't look good.
Something wrong?

1:42:23.508 --> 1:42:25.216
Oh, I just...
I had a rough night.

1:42:25.385 --> 1:42:26.500
Well, let's go, guys.

1:42:27.804 --> 1:42:29.264
- I'll take the center.
- All right.

1:44:15.859 --> 1:44:16.663
Hey! Hey!

1:44:16.774 --> 1:44:18.025
Carl...

1:44:39.203 --> 1:44:40.578
Wait, Carl!

1:44:41.705 --> 1:44:43.433
Get outta there!
Run!

1:44:43.608 --> 1:44:45.036
Hey! Hey! I found it.
It's right down here.

1:44:45.501 --> 1:44:48.075
Pull your gun on him!
Make him show you his badge!

1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:50.499
- What?
- He's got a gun!

1:44:50.500 --> 1:44:51.715
He's got a gun!

1:44:51.716 --> 1:44:54.050
He's not FBI! He's lying!

1:44:54.111 --> 1:44:55.320
What are you talking about?

1:44:55.387 --> 1:44:56.218
Just do it!

1:44:57.807 --> 1:45:00.180
I guess you might as well
just show him your badge.

1:44:59.644 --> 1:45:01.437
All right, all right.

1:45:01.644 --> 1:45:03.437
It's OK, Hank. He's gonna
show you his badge.

1:45:03.689 --> 1:45:05.349
Don't turn your back!

1:45:06.326 --> 1:45:07.369
Aah!

1:45:12.156 --> 1:45:13.532
Where's my money?

1:45:14.666 --> 1:45:15.813
Where is it?

1:45:22.126 --> 1:45:23.669
It's in the plane.

1:45:24.587 --> 1:45:25.369
Then go get it.

1:45:26.369 --> 1:45:27.469
Come on!

1:45:31.429 --> 1:45:33.765
You waiting for something, genius?
Do it!

1:45:33.814 --> 1:45:34.856
OK, OK.

1:46:04.006 --> 1:46:05.798
Come on! Today!

1:46:19.566 --> 1:46:21.227
OK, I've got it!

1:46:32.956 --> 1:46:35.163
Where the fuck is the rest...

1:46:39.588 --> 1:46:40.751
So you had a piece, huh?

1:46:49.099 --> 1:46:52.136
But you're not the cold-blooded type,
are you, Mr. Mitchell?

1:46:58.026 --> 1:47:00.731
Looks like we're both gonna have
an awful lot of explaining to do.

1:47:03.282 --> 1:47:04.278
Just me.

1:47:19.766 --> 1:47:20.809
Jacob?

1:47:29.636 --> 1:47:31.304
Hank?

1:47:32.982 --> 1:47:34.227
It's ok.

1:47:43.710 --> 1:47:44.543
Don't.

1:47:44.890 --> 1:47:45.516
Maybe...

1:47:45.517 --> 1:47:46.419
Don't. Don't.

1:47:46.420 --> 1:47:47.565
You're gonna mess it up.

1:47:47.207 --> 1:47:49.994
- Mess it... mess it up?
- Just leave him be.

1:47:50.103 --> 1:47:51.145
OK.

1:47:59.470 --> 1:48:01.428
You understand what we gotta say?

1:48:01.429 --> 1:48:02.628
Huh?

1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:08.144
We're gonna tell them that Carl lent me
the gun to signal if I found the plane.

1:48:09.606 --> 1:48:13.307
Then when I saw Baxter shoot him...

1:48:13.611 --> 1:48:15.236
We can't do this, Hank.

1:48:15.405 --> 1:48:16.400
What do you mean we can't?

1:48:16.781 --> 1:48:18.608
We're gonna have to tell on ourselves.

1:48:20.493 --> 1:48:21.324
No, we don't.

1:48:22.329 --> 1:48:23.609
We... we can't.

1:48:23.610 --> 1:48:24.297
No. No.

1:48:26.083 --> 1:48:28.789
- No. This is gonna work.
- Not anymore.

1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:34.062
Yeah.

1:48:34.385 --> 1:48:36.009
Yeah, it's gonna work.

1:48:38.973 --> 1:48:40.171
It's perfect.

1:48:41.602 --> 1:48:42.749
Come on, Jacob.

1:48:45.439 --> 1:48:48.606
We just gotta get through the next
couple of hours, and then we're home.

1:48:48.776 --> 1:48:50.318
We're home-free.

1:48:56.576 --> 1:48:58.237
You wanna be happy?

1:49:00.997 --> 1:49:02.790
You want a wife and kids?

1:49:03.626 --> 1:49:06.960
Me and you sitting around on
the porch drinking late at night?

1:49:10.717 --> 1:49:13.339
Well, God damn it,
this is what it costs...

1:49:14.513 --> 1:49:16.387
Right here, right now.

1:49:21.009 --> 1:49:21.945
Come on.

1:49:23.009 --> 1:49:23.945
Come on.

1:49:24.065 --> 1:49:27.731
Let's go over this again, make sure
we haven't overlooked anything.

1:49:30.156 --> 1:49:31.982
I wish somebody else
had found that money.

1:49:32.157 --> 1:49:34.151
Well, they didn't. Now quit.

1:49:43.796 --> 1:49:45.920
OK. Baxter came down here.

1:49:46.508 --> 1:49:49.129
He came up behind Carl.

1:49:52.222 --> 1:49:55.508
I was over there.
Yeah, and you were in the woods.

1:49:54.264 --> 1:49:55.411
Yeah. Yeah.

1:49:59.564 --> 1:50:02.684
Yeah. It's gonna work.
It's gonna work. Yeah.

1:50:07.198 --> 1:50:09.653
W-what are you doing?
Now put this back.

1:50:14.289 --> 1:50:17.077
Make it look like
the bad guy did it, Hank.

1:50:20.710 --> 1:50:21.440
What?

1:50:22.256 --> 1:50:23.834
W-we're almost home.

1:50:24.801 --> 1:50:26.259
I'm tired, Hank.

1:50:32.017 --> 1:50:35.967
A-a-and I don't care. It's ok with me.
I'm not... I'm not afraid.

1:50:38.849 --> 1:50:39.858
No, Jacob.

1:50:39.859 --> 1:50:42.267
- I'm not afraid. It's perfect.
- Stop that, Jacob.

1:50:42.289 --> 1:50:43.539
It's... it's perfect.

1:50:42.740 --> 1:50:43.540
No. No.

1:50:43.863 --> 1:50:46.153
Come on, Hank.
Let me do something.

1:50:45.063 --> 1:50:47.353
This is...
This is the only thing.

1:50:47.458 --> 1:50:49.443
See, I don't wanna sit around
the rest of my life

1:50:49.587 --> 1:50:51.359
thinking about this shit.
I can't do it...

1:50:50.621 --> 1:50:52.822
Sit on the porch and drink.
I can't do it.

1:50:52.950 --> 1:50:54.701
So you're gonna have to do it.

1:50:54.877 --> 1:50:55.623
Couple more hours,
we'll be home.

1:50:55.794 --> 1:50:58.998
You can do this, and it's
gonna be perfect for you.

1:50:59.173 --> 1:51:02.507
You got something to go on for, Hank,
and you know it.

1:51:03.636 --> 1:51:05.345
I don't wanna be here.

1:51:07.500 --> 1:51:09.290
No. Please, no.

1:51:09.559 --> 1:51:12.395
Come on, Hank.
Let me do something.

1:51:14.439 --> 1:51:18.652
You just tell the little girl that I...
that, you know, that bear is from me.

1:51:18.915 --> 1:51:20.062
You know?

1:51:34.587 --> 1:51:36.415
If you love me, Hank,
you'll do it.

1:51:38.383 --> 1:51:40.258
I'll give you a chance.
I won't look at you.

1:51:42.347 --> 1:51:44.505
I won't look at you, Hank,
but if you don't do it...

1:51:46.882 --> 1:51:48.133
then I'm gonna do it,

1:51:48.155 --> 1:51:50.889
and then we're gonna both
gonna be fucked, aren't we?

1:51:56.404 --> 1:52:01.100
We don't need to both be fucked.
I'll... I'll do it, Hank, if you don't.

1:52:01.117 --> 1:52:03.075
- No!
- I'm telling you I will.

1:52:11.879 --> 1:52:16.008
Boy, it's... it's funny about f-finding
this fucking plane, wasn't it?

1:52:21.361 --> 1:52:22.403
Jacob!

1:52:43.253 --> 1:52:44.296
Oh, Jacob!

1:53:11.322 --> 1:53:15.450
To someone who's been properly trained,
there are many ways to detect a liar.

1:53:15.702 --> 1:53:19.700
The shifty eyes of detective novels
have a certain basis in fact.

1:53:20.165 --> 1:53:22.288
A wooden or stilted tone.

1:53:23.043 --> 1:53:25.617
Gestures that seem either slightly robotic

1:53:25.796 --> 1:53:28.632
or else unnecessarily expansive.

1:53:30.093 --> 1:53:32.549
Details tend to be vague, slippery.

1:53:34.306 --> 1:53:37.722
Sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth
with his hand when he speaks.

1:53:38.936 --> 1:53:41.938
Did you notice anything like that
in the guy you shot today?

1:53:44.943 --> 1:53:47.399
He was lying to you, Mr. Mitchell.
He wasn't from the FBI.

1:53:47.571 --> 1:53:49.000
His name was Vernon Bokovsky.

1:53:49.001 --> 1:53:52.339
His brother was in that crashed plane
you found out there today.

1:53:52.118 --> 1:53:56.163
Bokovski and his brother were the guys who
kidnapped that McMartin girl last November.

1:53:56.331 --> 1:53:58.704
Remember the one they shot
and dumped in the lake?

1:53:58.917 --> 1:54:01.871
4.4 million in ransom money.
Want to touch it?

1:54:03.339 --> 1:54:04.619
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

1:54:08.804 --> 1:54:09.883
Pretty hefty, huh?

1:54:09.955 --> 1:54:11.928
That's only part of it.
We're still tracking down the rest.

1:54:12.098 --> 1:54:13.474
Yeah. It's just a matter of time.

1:54:14.184 --> 1:54:15.512
A matter of time?

1:54:17.230 --> 1:54:20.270
Well... we had the money for 2 hours
before the kidnappers picked it up.

1:54:20.441 --> 1:54:23.893
Couldn't mark it. We were afraid they'd
detect the markings and kill the girl, so, um...

1:54:24.070 --> 1:54:26.823
We put together a task force of 20 agents,

1:54:26.870 --> 1:54:31.300
and they wrote down as many of
the serial numbers as they could.

1:54:31.370 --> 1:54:34.076
We managed to record just
under 5.000 of them.

1:54:34.249 --> 1:54:35.992
That's 1 out of 10 of the bills.

1:54:37.752 --> 1:54:41.336
Now it's simply a matter of waiting
for the numbers to turn up.

1:54:42.049 --> 1:54:45.659
Can't go around passing $100 bills without
eventually sticking in someone's memory.

1:54:50.855 --> 1:54:52.002
No. No!

1:54:53.461 --> 1:54:54.921
No, Hank. Hank!
Oh, Hank!

1:54:56.774 --> 1:54:58.565
Hank, we can run with it.
We could leave the country.

1:54:58.734 --> 1:55:02.353
We could go to South America
or to Australia or someplace far away.

1:55:02.354 --> 1:55:03.781
Please, Hank!

1:55:03.782 --> 1:55:04.929
Aah! Aah.

1:56:08.439 --> 1:56:12.022
<i>There are days when I manage
not to think of anything at all...</i>

1:56:14.069 --> 1:56:15.398
<i>Not the money...</i>

1:56:16.697 --> 1:56:18.108
<i>Or the murders...</i>

1:56:20.035 --> 1:56:21.232
<i>Or Jacob...</i>

1:56:23.580 --> 1:56:27.661
<i>Days when Sarah and I try to pretend
that we're just like everyone else...</i>

1:56:29.212 --> 1:56:31.418
<i>As if none of it had ever happened.</i>

1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:36.671
<i>But those days are few and far between.</i>
