00:56.093 --> 00:57.403
Amityville's a dump

00:57.405 --> 01:00.112
and people can't move out fast enough.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.563
That's two good reasons why it's perfect

01:04.565 --> 01:07.148
for a newly single mom with four kids.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.003
I wish
you hadn't moved there.

01:10.005 --> 01:12.883
There are a lot of
stories about that place.

01:12.885 --> 01:14.463
Well, I'm out of options since Russel

01:14.465 --> 01:17.053
was killed in Iraq, you know that.

01:17.055 --> 01:17.923
I know.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.503
I just wish things had turned out

01:19.505 --> 01:21.783
differently for you Kelly Jo.

01:21.785 --> 01:22.618
Thanks Mom.

01:24.819 --> 01:25.673
You know what?

01:25.675 --> 01:26.843
Things are already looking up.

01:26.845 --> 01:30.953
I'm about to clean out this
really nice rummage sale.

01:30.955 --> 01:32.383
Then I gotta pick up
the kids from daycare.

01:32.385 --> 01:33.785
Then I'll talk to you later.

01:56.359 --> 01:57.190
Okay.

01:57.192 --> 01:59.715
You got a lot of stuff
available this late in the day.

02:02.325 --> 02:03.833
Do you mind if I use this?

02:03.835 --> 02:04.735
I'm gonna need it.

02:05.615 --> 02:06.728
Help yourself.

02:10.598 --> 02:15.442
As a mom of four, I look
for deals where I can.

02:16.401 --> 02:17.783
I wish I knew this house was for sale

02:17.785 --> 02:18.848
before I moved here.

02:19.919 --> 02:21.519
Is that supposed to be a joke?

02:23.415 --> 02:24.248
No.

02:25.515 --> 02:26.348
Should it be?

02:28.175 --> 02:31.973
It's just, things have happened here.

02:31.975 --> 02:35.360
The owners are gone.

02:38.645 --> 02:40.398
I'm the realtor actually.

02:42.215 --> 02:43.895
Nobody wants this house

02:44.765 --> 02:47.293
and nobody wants the stuff in it.

02:47.295 --> 02:48.388
I can't be picky.

02:51.005 --> 02:51.918
Give me all of it.

03:52.816 --> 03:57.118
I did what you said,
I did what you said!

04:18.408 --> 04:19.998
How did you jump in there?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.573
I don't remember putting you in there.

04:23.575 --> 04:26.649
You're definitely not
something I'd give to the kids.

08:52.578 --> 08:53.411
Ah.

11:40.081 --> 11:40.914
Melanie?

11:51.139 --> 11:55.930
It was a late deadline, baby.

11:55.932 --> 11:56.765
I'm sorry.

12:02.641 --> 12:03.474
Oh.

12:12.875 --> 12:17.875
Melanie?

12:17.991 --> 12:19.440
Melanie!

12:24.676 --> 12:25.509
Oh.

12:58.313 --> 13:00.946
Warden
Valentine's office.

13:00.948 --> 13:04.333
This is Eric Kates calling
for the warden again.

13:04.335 --> 13:06.803
And what
is this in reference to?

13:06.805 --> 13:10.153
Same thing it was last time
and the time before that.

13:10.155 --> 13:13.053
It's about Kelly Jo
Knight being on death row.

13:13.055 --> 13:15.313
I'd really like to get
an interview with her.

13:15.315 --> 13:17.593
Yes,
Warden Valentine asked me

13:17.595 --> 13:20.783
to tell you that prisoner
Knight is indisposed.

13:20.785 --> 13:22.823
Indisposed?

13:22.825 --> 13:24.833
She's been on death row for over a year.

13:24.835 --> 13:26.738
What could she possibly be doing?

14:34.435 --> 14:36.333
Looks like we got a couple

14:36.335 --> 14:38.848
of death row cuties here tonight.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.343
Renata here is the reigning champ

14:42.345 --> 14:45.233
of fight night so she knows the rules.

14:45.235 --> 14:47.793
Winner goes back to their cell.

14:47.795 --> 14:50.813
Loser goes somewhere you don't want to be

14:50.815 --> 14:52.713
and you may never come back.

14:52.715 --> 14:54.883
Put up a good fight for our audience

14:54.885 --> 14:57.113
or you both go to the red box

14:57.115 --> 14:58.933
and you stay there for a month

14:58.935 --> 15:00.938
until you come back and fight again.

15:01.785 --> 15:05.383
You've heard about the red
box all across the yard,

15:05.385 --> 15:09.753
but don't worry, the rats
step on the cockroaches

15:09.755 --> 15:13.213
and the snakes eat the rats.

15:13.215 --> 15:17.068
Those snakes, oh those snakes.

15:18.845 --> 15:22.043
All right, we got pervs paying good money

15:22.045 --> 15:24.068
for this stream so fight!

15:29.685 --> 15:32.009
Come on, you don't want the box.

15:37.934 --> 15:42.053
You're the one that killed
your four kids right?

15:42.055 --> 15:44.400
What, you don't want to fight an adult?

15:47.075 --> 15:49.573
I'm gonna get the chair
for the people I killed.

15:49.575 --> 15:52.003
I'm never gonna have
a chance to have kids,

15:52.005 --> 15:55.966
but if I did I wouldn't
throw them away like you.

16:02.215 --> 16:04.535
Oh shit, now it's on.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.713
All right, that's enough.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.958
Get her!

16:58.933 --> 17:01.266
Send 'em both to the island.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.178
Where are you taking us?

17:10.105 --> 17:11.036
You can't do this.

17:11.038 --> 17:12.393
I want to talk to my lawyer.

17:12.395 --> 17:15.592
Your lawyer got you
a date with old sparky.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.948
I don't think you need to be
calling your lawyer right now.

17:26.935 --> 17:29.293
Gonna miss you at fight night sweetheart.

17:29.295 --> 17:31.413
Five time champ.

17:31.415 --> 17:33.003
And it makes you wonder
how she didn't fight off

17:33.005 --> 17:34.505
those guys she said raped her.

17:35.765 --> 17:37.553
Probably into it.

17:37.555 --> 17:39.400
Not how it happened.

17:39.402 --> 17:42.023
Ah, we ain't ever gonna
know now are we sugar?

17:42.025 --> 17:46.653
You burned down that frat
house, killed 23 guys.

17:46.655 --> 17:48.755
She said it was five guys who had done it.

17:49.605 --> 17:51.338
Maybe it was 23 guys.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.363
I'd hate to think she accidentally killed

17:54.365 --> 17:56.138
all those innocent people.

17:57.705 --> 18:02.705
23 guys though and one hell
of a train.

18:09.045 --> 18:09.876
- Shit!
- Kill you,

18:09.878 --> 18:10.750
I'm going to kill you.

18:10.752 --> 18:12.534
Get off me, get off me!

18:12.536 --> 18:17.536
God dammit, get her off me!

18:25.630 --> 18:26.463
Hey!

18:27.537 --> 18:28.704
Get back here!

18:30.502 --> 18:31.335
Run!

18:32.711 --> 18:34.878
Stay here, I'll get her.

19:29.338 --> 19:31.005
Where, where am I?

19:33.063 --> 19:33.896
Huh?

19:39.962 --> 19:41.113
Fuck this.

20:00.501 --> 20:01.668
Come on, babe.

20:03.883 --> 20:05.326
You know the drill.

20:05.328 --> 20:06.478
What the fuck?

20:08.295 --> 20:09.722
Come on!

20:20.805 --> 20:22.205
Dammit, I told you to run.

20:23.105 --> 20:25.413
- Where's Hayden?
- Gone.

20:25.415 --> 20:27.398
Just gone.

20:29.175 --> 20:30.827
That little pussy.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.053
He's gonna get his ass
chewed by the warden

20:32.055 --> 20:34.073
if and when he gets back.

20:34.075 --> 20:35.913
I ain't waitin'.

20:35.915 --> 20:37.728
You, no more tricks.

20:39.885 --> 20:43.203
And you, I wasn't sure
you could even talk,

20:43.205 --> 20:46.116
but now that you are shut up!

20:46.118 --> 20:46.951
Get in.

20:48.577 --> 20:50.092
Shit.

21:33.948 --> 21:35.365
Come on, get out.

21:51.635 --> 21:53.208
Where are you taking us?

21:55.435 --> 21:57.568
Dinner cruise, get in.

22:04.695 --> 22:06.863
Kelly Jo, are you all right?

22:06.865 --> 22:09.173
Ah, there's that frigid
little child killer

22:09.175 --> 22:11.023
we've all grown to love.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.178
Bipolar much?

23:00.775 --> 23:01.775
This is Kates.

23:01.777 --> 23:04.705
Kates,
it's Guerrera at the magazine.

23:04.707 --> 23:05.977
Yeah?

23:05.979 --> 23:07.493
Hey, everybody here

23:07.495 --> 23:08.903
is wondering how you're doing?

23:08.905 --> 23:11.493
If you're feeling like
maybe coming back to work?

23:11.495 --> 23:13.503
Yeah boss, I am.

23:13.505 --> 23:16.380
If you're ready to put me
on those Amityville murders.

23:16.382 --> 23:17.393
You know this isn't

23:17.395 --> 23:19.605
that kind of magazine Eric.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.440
It could be.

23:21.335 --> 23:22.873
Somebody needs to connect the dots

23:22.875 --> 23:24.848
on those Amityville killings.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.213
There's no dots to connect.

23:31.215 --> 23:33.793
It's been a bunch of random killings.

23:33.795 --> 23:36.443
- Sad, but random.
- You don't know.

23:36.445 --> 23:39.183
- You weren't there.
- That's the problem Eric.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.983
You're too close to it.

23:40.985 --> 23:42.843
What happened to Melanie when

23:42.845 --> 23:44.613
she went and shot up that diner.

23:44.615 --> 23:46.863
You don't understand, that wasn't her.

23:46.865 --> 23:48.383
It happened later.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.193
Something changed after she

23:51.195 --> 23:53.450
cleaned out that first murder house.

23:53.452 --> 23:55.093
I'm sorry Eric.

23:55.095 --> 23:57.800
Maybe it's not time to come back yet.

23:57.802 --> 24:02.802
No, but it is time to
find out what's happening.

24:28.785 --> 24:30.808
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

24:31.825 --> 24:32.658
Get out.

24:43.286 --> 24:45.286
Two this time?

24:46.215 --> 24:47.088
Double the fun.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.893
Jeez, what was that?

25:03.895 --> 25:05.223
Insurance.

25:05.225 --> 25:08.303
A tracking device, also a poison capsule

25:08.305 --> 25:10.203
that can be snapped in two remotely

25:10.205 --> 25:11.723
if you wander off too far

25:11.725 --> 25:14.253
or walk in front of the
microwave while it's running.

25:15.088 --> 25:17.943
You might want to avoid
the break room.

25:17.945 --> 25:21.103
We only have one holding
cell for the specimens.

25:21.105 --> 25:23.353
57 has just ended their
experiment yesterday

25:23.355 --> 25:25.523
and nobody has cleaned up.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.213
Oh, one's of them's pretty quiet.

25:27.215 --> 25:30.153
Mom of the year there,
killed her four kids,

25:30.155 --> 25:32.193
pretty much keeps to herself.

25:32.195 --> 25:35.413
The other one burned down a
frat house after a bad date.

25:35.415 --> 25:37.413
Wiped out a bunch of rich kids.

25:37.415 --> 25:40.043
But that's not really a bad thing.

25:40.045 --> 25:41.713
She's a feisty one.

25:41.715 --> 25:43.365
I didn't ask for their history.

25:44.265 --> 25:46.684
We only need the uterus.

25:46.686 --> 25:49.298
You and me both brother, happy slicing.

26:04.873 --> 26:06.844
Ow.

26:06.846 --> 26:10.846
That's not all those
implants can do, come on.

26:41.055 --> 26:42.573
Hey, that asshole shot me.

26:42.575 --> 26:44.948
You're going to have to
do something about this.

26:46.195 --> 26:48.955
You won't want to ask
for the knife, believe me.

26:58.313 --> 27:00.200
They're penned up now,

27:00.202 --> 27:03.093
but even if you're not
swayed by your implants

27:03.095 --> 27:05.605
we do let the dogs out at night

27:06.485 --> 27:10.913
and they've been raised
on leftovers from the lab.

27:10.915 --> 27:14.563
If you decide to get clever
run towards the dogs,

27:14.565 --> 27:16.163
don't run away.

27:16.165 --> 27:19.567
Not even the dogs go on
that side of the island.

28:24.715 --> 28:25.973
Come on, Hayden.

28:25.975 --> 28:28.803
You don't want your balls in the ringer.

28:28.805 --> 28:29.638
Pick up.

28:51.975 --> 28:52.808
What the?

29:09.912 --> 29:14.079
We don't need a bigger
boat, we need a bigger gun.

29:28.633 --> 29:29.820
Ha!

29:29.822 --> 29:32.743
Don't bring pointy teeth to a gun fight.

30:10.638 --> 30:12.263
What's wrong with her?

30:12.265 --> 30:13.096
What do you think?

30:13.098 --> 30:14.373
She's crazy.

30:14.375 --> 30:16.773
She killed a bunch of people just like me.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.683
Plus she's from Amityville
so what're you gonna do?

30:19.685 --> 30:21.583
Half the town thinks
it's possessed by a demon

30:21.585 --> 30:22.720
and the other half thinks that

30:22.722 --> 30:24.572
the first half's trying to kill them.

30:26.165 --> 30:28.265
Come on now, we need to meet Dr. Ormond.

30:41.489 --> 30:42.322
Ah, 58.

30:46.361 --> 30:48.861
And I see we welcome a 59 too.

30:50.725 --> 30:51.993
I expect the warden's gonna want

30:51.995 --> 30:53.445
double pay for this shipment.

30:54.995 --> 30:58.595
Well, when we have such prime specimens

30:59.675 --> 31:01.138
why not pay the going rate?

31:03.205 --> 31:08.205
Let's not split hairs Dr.
Tyler over a few bobbles.

31:08.265 --> 31:09.965
This one's got a shoulder wound.

31:11.895 --> 31:14.633
Splitting hairs Dr. Tyler.

31:14.635 --> 31:15.873
Welcome.

31:15.875 --> 31:20.353
Welcome to our island and
our little laboratory.

31:20.355 --> 31:22.233
What is going on here?

31:22.235 --> 31:23.988
Nothing more than the future.

31:25.255 --> 31:26.305
The future of what?

31:27.565 --> 31:29.098
Why, the human race.

31:30.705 --> 31:33.698
And of course your future.

31:34.895 --> 31:37.373
Unless you enjoy living
out your remaining days

31:37.375 --> 31:41.498
with the warden's perverse
form of natural selection?

31:42.835 --> 31:45.663
You both had dates with
the machinery of justice

31:45.665 --> 31:48.593
and were in the shadow
of capital punishment.

31:48.595 --> 31:51.133
Here you can contribute to science.

31:51.135 --> 31:54.623
More specifically, the
problems of infertility.

31:54.625 --> 31:57.443
All right, if this place is above board

31:57.445 --> 32:00.223
then why do you have to
get women off of death row?

32:00.225 --> 32:03.273
And then why are you hiding
out on a tiny island?

32:03.275 --> 32:07.653
Well, Dr. Tyler here
had some predilections

32:07.655 --> 32:10.083
that are frowned upon in the more

32:10.085 --> 32:12.038
restrictive medical communities.

32:13.045 --> 32:15.998
And I, well I have the opposite problem.

32:17.315 --> 32:19.643
Most won't admit that
a total lack of empathy

32:19.645 --> 32:23.388
for human test subjects is a good thing.

32:24.315 --> 32:25.798
The hour is getting late.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.375
Tomorrow is the first day

32:29.675 --> 32:31.788
of a new chapter in the rest of your life.

32:33.615 --> 32:36.083
I can't say our accommodations
are better than the prison,

32:36.085 --> 32:37.435
as I have never been there,

32:38.315 --> 32:42.112
but we do promise a more
collaborative atmosphere.

32:46.861 --> 32:48.416
Don't let her touch that.

32:48.418 --> 32:50.008
Get 58 away from there.

33:09.975 --> 33:12.721
What, you don't want to fight an adult?

33:15.015 --> 33:17.663
I'm gonna get the chair
for people I killed.

33:17.665 --> 33:19.913
I'm never gonna have
a chance to have kids,

33:19.915 --> 33:23.138
but if I did I wouldn't
throw them away like you.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.138
Dammit Ellison, pick up.

33:30.205 --> 33:31.803
If you two are out there goofing off

33:31.805 --> 33:33.733
instead of hightailing it back here

33:33.735 --> 33:36.368
you're gonna lose your
cellblock harem privileges.

33:41.835 --> 33:44.083
High quality dirt bags are getting harder

33:44.085 --> 33:45.278
and harder to find.

33:54.575 --> 33:58.298
Dammit Ellison, look at porn
on your own freaking computer.

34:04.470 --> 34:05.867
What the hell?

35:04.612 --> 35:06.798
If you stay calm you'll get fed.

35:16.775 --> 35:19.898
I don't think we're in
the prison anymore are we?

35:20.925 --> 35:21.963
Nope.

35:21.965 --> 35:23.293
And you're house didn't get picked up

35:23.295 --> 35:25.108
by a tornado either, sunshine.

35:29.565 --> 35:31.665
I think I liked you better as a vegetable.

35:36.394 --> 35:38.738
I don't like that look
you're giving me though.

35:39.865 --> 35:42.675
Well, they were not
expecting two of us so...

35:44.162 --> 35:46.773
I don't think I'm gonna
get much sleep anyway.

35:46.775 --> 35:48.249
We have to find a way out of here.

35:51.635 --> 35:53.768
Oh, they weren't kidding about those dogs.

36:11.905 --> 36:14.763
58 did something to that computer.

36:14.765 --> 36:17.788
It has very important files
on all of our specimens on it.

36:18.765 --> 36:20.873
Make sure we haven't lost anything

36:20.875 --> 36:23.503
and don't wake me unless
there's an emergency.

36:23.505 --> 36:25.208
We have a long day tomorrow.

37:25.885 --> 37:29.788
So they asked me to keep a video diary.

37:30.895 --> 37:33.003
Day one, I guess.

37:33.005 --> 37:34.355
I know what I did was wrong

37:36.135 --> 37:39.798
and I'm here to repay for that.

37:41.545 --> 37:45.495
What I did was I bombed an abortion clinic

37:46.835 --> 37:50.933
and the fire from it spread

37:50.935 --> 37:53.458
to the neighborhood
killing a lot of people.

37:55.955 --> 38:00.143
I plead guilty and I was
expecting to go on death row

38:00.145 --> 38:03.825
when I got a visit from
these science geeks

38:04.735 --> 38:09.387
and they said if I did their project,

38:09.389 --> 38:12.793
if I was involved voluntarily
with their experiment

38:12.795 --> 38:15.523
one year I'd be free, done.

38:15.525 --> 38:17.423
I'm thinking this has
gotta be some kind of

38:17.425 --> 38:20.913
MKUltra government something or other,

38:20.915 --> 38:25.143
but beats waiting around for
a few decades to die right.

38:25.145 --> 38:28.083
Anyway, so here I am.

38:28.918 --> 38:30.953
They keep saying what I did was wrong.

38:30.955 --> 38:35.013
But it was God that told me
to bomb the abortion clinic

38:35.015 --> 38:38.473
and I really believe that
it is God that brought me

38:38.475 --> 38:42.773
to this fertility clinic
to do the right thing.

38:42.775 --> 38:46.513
Dr. Ormond calls me specimen 44.

38:46.515 --> 38:49.253
He actually calls me
that like it's my name,

38:49.255 --> 38:52.618
but my real name is Tammica, or Tammy.

38:56.235 --> 38:57.068
Tammy.

38:59.086 --> 38:59.919
Tammy.

39:09.795 --> 39:10.974
Remember that chick
that pulled the train

39:10.976 --> 39:12.976
at the party last night?

39:33.025 --> 39:34.020
Hey babe.

39:34.022 --> 39:36.503
Can I get a dirty chai, extra shots,

39:36.505 --> 39:37.878
whipped cream if you got it?

39:45.945 --> 39:47.958
I gotta get more whipped cream.

40:01.895 --> 40:04.083
Hey dude, remember that
chick that pulled the train

40:04.085 --> 40:06.023
at the house party last night?

40:06.025 --> 40:07.033
Yeah.

40:07.035 --> 40:09.435
She works at this coffee
shop I stopped at dude.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.560
No, she was passed out
by the time I got there,

40:15.562 --> 40:17.193
but I was like four or five in.

40:17.195 --> 40:19.306
I was absolutely trashed.

40:22.285 --> 40:23.118
Hello?

40:24.518 --> 40:25.643
Renata, it's Clarice.

40:25.645 --> 40:27.083
Are you okay?

40:27.085 --> 40:28.125
You sound sick.

40:29.008 --> 40:30.831
No, I'm fine.

40:30.833 --> 40:31.803
Well that's cool

40:31.805 --> 40:34.683
because I need to ask
you for a huge favor.

40:34.685 --> 40:37.485
I've got a big catering gig
and Sophie couldn't make it.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.218
I can't, I'm at my job.

40:42.446 --> 40:44.873
Your second other job,

40:44.875 --> 40:46.218
or your third other job?

40:47.715 --> 40:51.433
- The barista job.
- No, that's cool.

40:51.435 --> 40:53.593
Mostly I need somebody to go get my pickup

40:53.595 --> 40:55.403
and drive it over to this wedding.

40:55.405 --> 40:57.523
All of the sudden they
need extra steaks grilled

40:57.525 --> 41:00.053
and I've got like five
propane tanks in the bed.

41:00.055 --> 41:02.313
Do you think you could call Andy?

41:02.315 --> 41:06.193
- We broke up.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

41:06.195 --> 41:08.203
Not your day I guess.

41:08.205 --> 41:09.658
I guess not.

41:11.915 --> 41:12.748
Wait.

41:14.955 --> 41:17.538
Did you say five propane tanks?

41:32.095 --> 41:33.038
Come on now.

41:34.885 --> 41:36.528
Where are you taking her?

41:37.455 --> 41:40.190
My colleague wanted you, but
I haven't had my coffee yet.

41:40.192 --> 41:42.970
I don't want to deal with your shit.

41:42.972 --> 41:45.713
I'll tell him I got your numbers mixed up.

41:45.715 --> 41:48.603
What the hell is going on here?

41:48.605 --> 41:51.005
Believe me, you'll just
want to hang out here.

42:13.305 --> 42:15.321
How much did you give her?

42:15.323 --> 42:16.906
I thought enough.

42:18.615 --> 42:20.663
It will have to be.

42:20.665 --> 42:21.873
We aren't getting more anesthetic

42:21.875 --> 42:24.138
unless we start showing results.

42:27.155 --> 42:30.733
Be proud to be a part
of our grand experiment.

42:30.735 --> 42:34.198
An experiment to create the
next generation of mankind.

42:35.355 --> 42:40.162
But first, we need a womb fit for a god.

43:39.226 --> 43:41.490
This is
Warden Valentine's office.

43:41.492 --> 43:44.380
This is Eric Kates for Warden Valentine.

43:44.382 --> 43:46.073
I called yesterday.

43:46.075 --> 43:47.153
Warden Valentine

43:47.155 --> 43:48.428
is taking personal leave.

43:49.450 --> 43:50.313
I don't believe that.

43:50.315 --> 43:52.266
He was just there yesterday.

43:52.268 --> 43:54.013
I'm sorry, sir.

43:54.015 --> 43:55.203
This is unacceptable.

43:55.205 --> 43:56.293
I'm trying to get an interview

43:56.295 --> 43:57.693
with Kelly Jo Knight.

43:57.695 --> 44:01.683
She's my, she's our only living link

44:01.685 --> 44:03.923
to what's been going on in Amityville.

44:03.925 --> 44:06.523
And
what's that Mr. Kates?

44:06.525 --> 44:09.083
Murders, and not tied
to a single location

44:09.085 --> 44:10.563
or a single person.

44:10.565 --> 44:12.863
We may be talking about cursed objects

44:12.865 --> 44:16.303
or something that is passed
between people like a virus.

44:16.305 --> 44:17.883
And Kelly Jo Knight is the only person

44:17.885 --> 44:20.063
that can shed light on this.

44:20.065 --> 44:21.383
What magazine did

44:21.385 --> 44:22.863
you say you were with, sir?

44:22.865 --> 44:27.865
I'm working as a freelancer on this one.

44:27.925 --> 44:28.893
I see.

44:28.895 --> 44:31.085
Someone will get back with you, sir.

45:14.914 --> 45:15.747
Ah.

45:34.895 --> 45:37.073
- Editor's desk.
- It's Kates.

45:37.075 --> 45:38.882
I'm on my way to the prison.

45:38.884 --> 45:39.715
You sure that's

45:39.717 --> 45:41.433
the best thing to do right now?

45:41.435 --> 45:42.483
Something is happening there.

45:42.485 --> 45:45.161
Something to Kelly Jo
Knight and the warden.

45:45.163 --> 45:46.622
I'm gonna find out what it is.

45:46.624 --> 45:48.153
Eric.

45:48.155 --> 45:51.223
Just call ahead Guerrera
and get me a media pass.

45:51.225 --> 45:52.178
I'm en route.

46:20.685 --> 46:21.885
What'd they do to you?

46:26.495 --> 46:27.623
Hey, she's sick.

46:27.625 --> 46:29.125
You can't leave her like this.

46:33.545 --> 46:34.903
Hey!

46:34.905 --> 46:36.123
Something isn't right.

46:36.125 --> 46:38.763
It's just the fertility drugs.

46:38.765 --> 46:39.878
She'll be fine.

46:41.075 --> 46:43.988
And if not we have you.

46:47.985 --> 46:49.503
Kelly Jo, hey.

46:49.505 --> 46:52.348
Kelly Jo, we need to get out of here.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.363
We gotta get out of here.

46:55.365 --> 46:58.411
I don't know exactly what I'm asking.

47:00.835 --> 47:02.342
Or who I'm asking.

48:22.394 --> 48:24.423
Kelly Jo, hey Kelly Jo.

48:24.425 --> 48:26.573
Come on, get up, let's go.

48:26.575 --> 48:27.768
Let's go, come on.

48:44.428 --> 48:45.261
Move it!

49:19.425 --> 49:20.653
Wait.

49:20.655 --> 49:23.823
We don't know what these implants do

49:23.825 --> 49:25.198
and what the range is.

49:27.375 --> 49:28.710
Looks like a RadioShack threw up in here.

49:28.712 --> 49:31.048
I don't even know where to start.

49:32.085 --> 49:33.183
I do know the doctor didn't want us

49:33.185 --> 49:34.835
messing with his computer though.

49:40.455 --> 49:44.105
There are tons of files on here.

50:08.179 --> 50:09.929
Look at this one, 44.

50:17.888 --> 50:20.728
It's been accessed hundreds of times.

50:21.625 --> 50:25.638
Dr. Tyler told me
exactly what is going on.

50:27.435 --> 50:31.048
He isn't this fertility specialist.

50:32.255 --> 50:34.018
He's a clone expert.

50:35.435 --> 50:38.403
And not just any ordinary
everyday cloning,

50:38.405 --> 50:39.878
if that is a real thing,

50:41.145 --> 50:44.968
he specializes in the super soldier.

50:49.185 --> 50:54.185
So, where do you get super
soldiers to grow from?

50:55.095 --> 50:57.692
That's the main problem
that they are facing.

51:03.385 --> 51:06.143
So I admit that I killed a lot of mothers

51:06.145 --> 51:07.898
when I firebombed that clinic,

51:09.835 --> 51:13.668
but this is the way to make things right.

51:14.531 --> 51:17.413
This is how I'm gonna make my penance.

51:17.415 --> 51:18.535
This is how...

51:19.905 --> 51:24.905
This is the reason why I did
all of that to begin with

51:26.115 --> 51:29.678
because by cleansing them from the Earth,

51:30.745 --> 51:33.565
by cleansing them from this world entirely

51:34.435 --> 51:39.435
I get to usher in a new
stronger humanoid race.

51:44.805 --> 51:49.232
I get to be the new Mary to the new God.

52:07.935 --> 52:09.658
The pain is great.

52:11.275 --> 52:12.108
And glorious.

52:19.115 --> 52:24.115
I think that my doctor, Tyler...

52:34.855 --> 52:37.022
This is for you Dr. Tyler.

52:44.140 --> 52:46.713
What did they do to me?

52:46.715 --> 52:48.023
Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here

52:48.025 --> 52:50.455
and then find a real doctor.

52:50.457 --> 52:52.683
We just gotta figure out how to get these

52:52.685 --> 52:54.658
damn implants out of our necks.

53:06.728 --> 53:08.183
Did you think the plans would be

53:08.185 --> 53:10.808
in a Word document or something?

53:11.685 --> 53:13.838
Like we were cut rate Bond villains?

53:15.035 --> 53:16.528
The implants don't come out.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.128
There's no reason for them to.

53:46.495 --> 53:49.663
I never have understood
humans and their feelings.

53:49.665 --> 53:51.858
That is why I went into nanotechnology.

53:53.385 --> 53:55.633
Those little implants.

53:55.635 --> 53:56.748
Yours are so big.

53:57.915 --> 54:01.211
They can administer shocks, poison.

54:02.435 --> 54:04.143
Now you have nanotech rebuilt

54:04.145 --> 54:07.433
in your uterus into a superstructure.

54:07.435 --> 54:10.713
And when the time is right they
will release fertilized eggs

54:10.715 --> 54:13.981
that will grow into Tyler's
superior race of humans.

54:15.807 --> 54:18.988
I will be disappointed however
if they all have his face.

54:19.953 --> 54:21.487
No!

54:29.845 --> 54:31.783
One day the name Ormond and Tyler

54:31.785 --> 54:33.043
will be said in the same breath

54:33.045 --> 54:35.938
as Watson and Crick are
when one speaks of DNA.

54:39.285 --> 54:41.488
Only better and with more reverence.

54:42.345 --> 54:46.356
For we will usher in the
next evolution in humankind.

54:57.075 --> 54:59.443
She got one of those
things in me, god dammit.

54:59.445 --> 55:00.528
How did she?

55:02.245 --> 55:04.723
You foolish, foolish man.

55:04.725 --> 55:07.212
Don't tell me you found another Tammy.

55:07.214 --> 55:08.047
There...

55:09.943 --> 55:13.043
There will never be another Tammy.

55:13.045 --> 55:15.115
She did love a terrible and twisted god

55:16.195 --> 55:17.595
so I can see the attraction.

55:28.150 --> 55:29.524
Come here.

55:30.359 --> 55:31.658
All right, come on, let's go.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.493
They said we weren't doctors anymore

55:57.495 --> 55:59.008
and now we're acting like it.

56:00.575 --> 56:02.168
Something got into my brain.

56:03.195 --> 56:05.983
And something else got into your pants.

56:05.985 --> 56:07.458
And see where that lead us?

56:09.445 --> 56:14.248
Release the dogs and then
go chase the specimens down.

56:14.250 --> 56:16.350
I'm not going out there with those dogs.

56:17.825 --> 56:22.228
As you know, they too only
have a taste for female flesh.

56:39.345 --> 56:40.475
Try winging them.

56:41.672 --> 56:44.088
Aim away from the vagina for once.

57:11.756 --> 57:14.796
Hopefully we're gonna find the water.

57:28.465 --> 57:29.943
Nothing.

57:29.945 --> 57:32.644
They will make for the beach.

57:32.646 --> 57:35.300
How come I'm the one
out here doing this?

57:35.302 --> 57:38.242
You tainted the specimens.

57:38.244 --> 57:40.473
You broke it, you buy it, huh?

57:40.475 --> 57:41.875
Didn't copy that.

58:36.921 --> 58:38.996
The prisoners always
turn on their masters.

58:54.695 --> 58:55.998
Dr. Tyler!

59:12.942 --> 59:14.859
We gotta find a boat.

59:17.297 --> 59:21.025
A canoe, a rowboat,
pontoon, dingy, something.

59:21.027 --> 59:22.775
We gotta follow the shore line.

59:25.455 --> 59:29.053
Kelly Jo, it's gonna be okay, all right?

59:29.055 --> 59:30.893
We just gotta follow the
shoreline, all right?

59:30.895 --> 59:31.728
Let's go.

59:34.665 --> 59:35.938
Dr. Tyler?

59:39.725 --> 59:41.098
Dr. Tyler?

59:47.465 --> 59:51.933
You froze too many clone
embryos, got ambitious,

59:51.935 --> 59:54.563
should've thought about job security.

59:54.565 --> 59:56.773
Now I'm in the line of fire

59:56.775 --> 01:00:00.178
and I'm the only one that knows
a jot about nanotechnology.

01:00:01.578 --> 01:00:03.588
Now where did we put that accursed gun?

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:46.978
No dogs.

01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:50.998
So they've left the beach, gone north.

01:00:56.895 --> 01:00:59.298
This is not a great day for science.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.988
You're specimen nine aren't you?

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:46.455
I remember you well.

01:01:47.407 --> 01:01:48.818
You were young and strong.

01:01:49.795 --> 01:01:52.253
You should've been the perfect vessel

01:01:52.255 --> 01:01:54.533
save for one mistake,

01:01:54.535 --> 01:01:57.033
we gave you too many nanobots.

01:01:57.035 --> 01:02:00.123
Now we know to only
insert them in the uterus

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:02.108
otherwise they overwhelm the body.

01:02:04.845 --> 01:02:07.733
I thought the nanobots
would eventually kill you.

01:02:07.735 --> 01:02:09.688
I wonder how you are still ambulatory.

01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.603
The nanotech we applied relies on

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:14.388
living tissue to do its work.

01:02:16.415 --> 01:02:18.308
You should've expired long ago.

01:02:19.355 --> 01:02:23.388
Of course, you are
acquiring living tissue.

01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:25.638
You have evolved.

01:02:29.242 --> 01:02:31.935
As much as I'm proud of my
contributions to science

01:02:33.977 --> 01:02:37.651
you are a beautiful perfect thing.

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:49.788
Okay, we gotta find
out what's going on here.

01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:55.253
If somebody has a rifle on this island

01:02:55.255 --> 01:02:57.896
then we should probably get it ourselves.

01:02:57.898 --> 01:02:58.938
Come on, let's go.

01:03:38.045 --> 01:03:38.878
Nothing.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.142
Nothing.

01:04:06.831 --> 01:04:07.664
Come on.

01:04:12.295 --> 01:04:13.128
Is it...

01:04:13.995 --> 01:04:16.448
I don't know what the hell happened.

01:04:18.285 --> 01:04:20.778
I have been possessed by something.

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.703
It made a mistake,

01:04:23.705 --> 01:04:26.403
jumped from me into something

01:04:26.405 --> 01:04:29.088
that was neither alive or dead.

01:04:30.585 --> 01:04:32.835
I don't think it can come back.

01:04:34.268 --> 01:04:35.685
I think I'm free.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.478
But free to do what?

01:04:48.315 --> 01:04:50.865
First thing's first, we
gotta go catch that boat.

01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:53.639
Okay.

01:05:06.838 --> 01:05:08.843
We can't go back to Amityville.

01:05:08.845 --> 01:05:10.358
Nobody there will understand.

01:05:11.785 --> 01:05:14.043
I have a feeling they might.

01:05:14.045 --> 01:05:15.845
We're not gonna risk it though okay?

01:05:17.395 --> 01:05:20.628
We just stay on the shoreline
and just keep going up north.

01:05:21.645 --> 01:05:25.658
And not run out of gas,
we'll hit Canada, okay?

01:07:02.402 --> 01:07:04.460
- Come on, it's coming.
- Are you sure, are you sure?

01:07:04.462 --> 01:07:07.063
- It's coming.
- Are you sure?

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:09.903
Okay, I'm gonna go get some
water and towels, okay?

01:07:09.905 --> 01:07:11.280
It's coming now.

01:07:11.282 --> 01:07:13.463
Okay, all right, let's do this.

01:07:13.465 --> 01:07:14.328
You can do it.

01:07:15.439 --> 01:07:16.520
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

01:07:16.522 --> 01:07:19.403
All right, just breathe, breathe.

01:07:19.405 --> 01:07:20.563
Breathe.

01:07:20.565 --> 01:07:21.883
Push.

01:07:21.885 --> 01:07:23.813
Push.

01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:25.698
Oh, I see it, I see it.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.475
- I need to push.
- Okay, push.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:28.780
The baby's coming.

01:07:28.782 --> 01:07:29.615
It's...

01:07:31.937 --> 01:07:32.770
It's...

01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:35.996
What, what, what?

01:07:47.587 --> 01:07:52.587
