in a boarding school

09:03.410 --> 09:06.144

like portland.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.746
You'd get
financial support

09:07.748 --> 09:09.981
And college tuition
from the state

09:09.983 --> 09:11.483
After graduation.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.654
And how long
would I be gone?

09:15.656 --> 09:19.824
Until the trial, which right now
could mean another two years.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.595
And would I be able to
spend any time with sharon?

09:23.597 --> 09:25.497
Or you?

09:25.499 --> 09:28.733

everyone now and again --
no.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.736
No contact at all.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.938
I'm sorry.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.842
Okay,
what's the second option?

09:37.844 --> 09:39.878
You keep living
with captain raydor

09:39.880 --> 09:42.280
Under round-the-clock
protection

09:42.282 --> 09:44.516
With the understanding
that if you ever

09:44.518 --> 09:48.920
Purposely separate yourself
from your security detail again,

09:48.922 --> 09:49.955
You're gone.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.357
Tell me I can trust you,

09:52.359 --> 09:54.359
And I will also
let go of the officers

09:54.361 --> 09:56.361

in this building.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.965

And the third option?

10:01.268 --> 10:04.235
Ah.
There is no third option!

10:04.237 --> 10:05.804
Think the two you have
over.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.473
Let us know your decision
by tomorrow.

10:15.247 --> 10:19.317

my decision.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.755
There is a third option,
damn it.

10:23.757 --> 10:27.058
Not while his legal guardian
withholds her consent.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.894
And raydor has her own threats
to deal with now.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.730
Why she would even
want to keep the kid

10:31.732 --> 10:33.765
Under these circumstances,
I don't know --

10:33.767 --> 10:36.935
Especially with a good school
willing to take him on.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.070
Will you at least think
about the third option?

10:40.840 --> 10:41.840
I'll think about it.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.743
Thank you. Thank you.

a dealer yet?

10:50.917 --> 10:53.518

In the most public way
possible.

We're using electronic sniffers
at all their lockers,

Searching for poison
and other contraband.

for a no-penalty drop zone,

Where kids can anonymously
turn in their dope,

11:30.791 --> 11:32.090

Is that girl
dropping drugs off,

11:45.305 --> 11:47.272
Or is she taking them
out of the bin?

11:49.575 --> 11:51.209
No, they're going in.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.547
Hold on --
chris, now, you promised --

11:55.549 --> 11:58.917
We promised the student body
no police. Is she a cop?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.185
She's a detective
with major crimes

12:00.187 --> 12:02.987
Trying to stop students
from dying.

12:02.989 --> 12:06.191
And you are?
Dr. Newman,

12:06.193 --> 12:09.060
I have a card here,
uh, somewhere.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.696
I'm sorry.
I-I-I meant no disrespect.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.698
Um, deaths
in the student population

12:13.700 --> 12:15.533
Can sometimes lead
to serious trauma issues.

Pardon me.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.875
Mr. Harris,
did you know the pushkins?
Uh, not really.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.610
As vice principal,
I deal with conduct issues,

And those two boys
weren't even on my radar.

Here. Found it.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.417
It also has my cell on it
if you need me in a hurry.

12:33.552 --> 12:36.221
Thank you, doctor.
It's very useful.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.856

12:37.858 --> 12:40.091
Ever run into anyone
who was close to the victims?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.927
No, but why don't you talk to
the head of our esl program.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.029
She was konstantin's
favorite teacher.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.365

I will.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.369
I don't know
where to begin.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.971
I've been a teacher
for six years now,

12:52.973 --> 12:56.207
And konstantin was easily
the best student I've ever had.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.610
English was
his second language?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.445
Yes, but he wrote better

13:00.447 --> 13:03.882
Than the kids
who were born here.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.088
But they're both openly
opposed to the government,

13:10.090 --> 13:14.492

his brother, too?

13:22.569 --> 13:25.403
No.

But I'm faculty advisor
for all the e.L.A. Students,

13:28.608 --> 13:32.777
So I knew alexander,
just not as well as konstantin.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.846
Were you aware
the boys used drugs?

13:34.848 --> 13:37.749
No.
Could they have had
a suicide pact?

13:37.751 --> 13:40.451
No. No,

in the cafeteria last week.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.642
They didn't throw punches,
but they shoved each other.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.010
Do you know this boy?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.012
He's a very smart kid.

Why did you skip school
today, ian?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.196
I was sick to my stomach.
Flynn: Hmm, funny.

That's the symptom
most people get

14:36.543 --> 14:38.810
So, what do you cut your drugs
with, mr. Early admissions?

14:38.812 --> 14:41.746
I don't cut them with anything.
I don't do drugs.

<i>Oh, so you sell molly</i>

he had a genius I.Q.,

And to prove it,
he pushes me.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.243
I push him back,
and then I forgot about it.

I didn't kill anybody.

over with.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.256
Oh, no, no, no.
Leave her out of this.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.994

Shouldn't take too long.

<i>Burner phone, huh?</i>

<i>Smarter than he looks.</i>

shoot myself instead?

17:17.303 --> 17:19.237

with your product?
I forget.

17:20.072 --> 17:22.206
Maybe jail
will help you remember.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.675

arresting me.
I changed my mind.

with felony distribution,

up to murder.

Against the wall,
put your hands behind your back.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.489
And now you can have a lawyer.
You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say or do
may be used against
you in a court of law.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.493
You have the
right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one,

17:42.495 --> 17:43.761

for you by the state.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.736

no more deaths

17:52.839 --> 17:54.238
Associated with

increasingly like

18:14.793 --> 18:17.862

You only have two options.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.864
No -- option one is
keeping things the same,

18:19.866 --> 18:22.300
Option two is jumping into
the witness protection program,

18:22.302 --> 18:23.634

catching this guy

18:23.636 --> 18:25.603
Who's writing me
all the letters, right?

18:25.605 --> 18:26.971
That has to be
option three.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.439
A-and what's the best way
to catch someone

18:28.441 --> 18:31.542
Who's looking for me?
We both know.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.944

In a police action.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.380

is a police action.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.915
And will you please
let me see

18:37.917 --> 18:39.383
The new letters
that have come in, please,

18:39.385 --> 18:41.486
So I could at least know
how serious to take this?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.221
That is not even
a possibility.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.856
They were written to me.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.292
Okay, if you don't
let me read the letters,

18:48.294 --> 18:50.828
Then I'm going
to the boarding school.

18:55.567 --> 18:58.769
There are definite pluses
to boarding school, rusty.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.240
I would love to have you --
sharon, how can you
even say that?!

19:02.242 --> 19:03.474
You just said it,
young man.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.310
Yes, yes, I said it,
but it...

19:06.312 --> 19:08.946
It's just --
it's not fair, sharon.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.816
I've got nothing
to negotiate with here.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.452
Look, all I want to do is --
is go back to school

19:14.454 --> 19:18.256
And -- and to play chess
with an actual human being,

19:18.258 --> 19:21.192
And -- I don't know -- maybe
talk to someone my own age.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.161
I offered to let kris visit,
and her parents told me --

19:23.163 --> 19:26.597
Never, never,
and stop talking about kris.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.633
It only makes me mad.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.602

saved your life.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.704
I don't care.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.674
Oh.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but overhear.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.509
Yes?

19:38.511 --> 19:39.810
I could go to school
with the kid.

No one would know

techniques that could help.

as a buy-guy,

immediately on patrol?

What?

19:50.790 --> 19:54.492
Uh, b-u-y, as in buys drugs
from teenage dealers.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.328

Sorry.

who plays chess.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.432

Taylor: Captain,
hear the lieutenant out.

30:36.302 --> 30:40.204
You cannot keep this kid
locked in your condo forever.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.806
You think rusty will stay
with the security detail

30:42.808 --> 30:46.043
One second longer
than he has to?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.878
Or that he's
over his mother enough

30:47.880 --> 30:49.813
That he won't just suddenly
pull up stakes and vanish

30:49.815 --> 30:51.315
If things
don't get better?

30:51.317 --> 30:54.017
Because in four months,
he turns 18,

30:54.019 --> 30:56.186
And I'm afraid you're
gonna be very surprised.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.889
I've been thinking
about it, captain,

30:58.891 --> 31:01.124
And finding the guy
making these threats

31:01.126 --> 31:03.126
Should be
our first priority,

31:03.128 --> 31:05.829
And that investigation
has stalled.

31:05.831 --> 31:09.499
Now, the operational value
of putting rusty on the street

31:09.501 --> 31:13.136
Is worth the risk, and
we should use him while we can.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.873
I don't care about
his operational value.

31:15.875 --> 31:20.644
My primary concern
as his mother is...

31:22.146 --> 31:24.748
...As his guardian...

31:24.750 --> 31:26.984
Is to keep him safe.

31:26.986 --> 31:30.387
That's the fiction
parents fall back on,

31:30.389 --> 31:34.725
Thinking that we, somehow,
can keep our children safe.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.727
It's impossible.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.496
Look at those dead boys
we found this morning.

31:39.498 --> 31:44.334
Their parents sent them away
to protect them.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.903
How did that work out?

31:45.905 --> 31:47.404
Forget about rusty.

31:47.406 --> 31:51.008
This lunatic is making threats
against you, too.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.376
Those threats
are ridiculous.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.379
I am the only thing
standing between rusty

31:55.381 --> 31:58.215
And the witness
protection program.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.683
Okay, let's get back
to the boy.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.552
What do you think
he'd want to do,

32:02.554 --> 32:04.288
Given the chance?

32:07.759 --> 32:11.194
Help.

32:11.196 --> 32:14.031
He'd want to help.

32:14.033 --> 32:17.067
Uh, call me cynical --
everybody does --

32:17.069 --> 32:19.870
But when a teenager
wants to do something --

32:19.872 --> 32:23.240
I mean really,
really wants to do something --

32:23.242 --> 32:26.109
It's a perfect opportunity
for a parent --

32:26.111 --> 32:32.115
Or a deal-maker --
to negotiate concessions.

32:32.117 --> 32:36.753
Sharon, we know
what rusty wants from us,

32:36.755 --> 32:41.158
But what do you want
from him?

33:08.453 --> 33:11.455
[ sighs ]

33:11.457 --> 33:13.290
I can represent
your wife, chris,

33:13.292 --> 33:14.925
But I can't
represent you, too.

33:14.927 --> 33:16.326
I have a conflict.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.761
What do you mean,
"a conflict"?

33:17.763 --> 33:19.129
I don't want an outsider
handling this.

33:19.131 --> 33:22.366
By a conflict, chris,
<i>I mean you.</i>

33:22.368 --> 33:25.936
My conflict is you.
<i>Me? How?</i>

33:25.938 --> 33:27.471
<i>What the hell is that</i>
<i>supposed to mean?</i>

33:27.473 --> 33:29.306
<i>Your wife's more than</i>
<i>reasonable doubt is you.</i>

33:29.308 --> 33:30.474
<i>It's you.</i>

33:30.476 --> 33:32.042
<i>I don't understand.</i>

33:32.044 --> 33:33.510
You bought her the computer
<i>where they found</i>

33:33.512 --> 33:34.945
The internet searches
<i>for the cyanide.</i>

33:34.947 --> 33:36.346
<i>You were</i>
<i>a science teacher</i>

33:36.348 --> 33:37.981
<i>Before you became</i>
<i>an administrator.</i>

33:37.983 --> 33:39.616
You have been mixing chemicals
in your bedroom

33:39.618 --> 33:41.351
Since you were
11 years old!

33:41.353 --> 33:45.188
My god, chris. How...
They were boys!

33:45.190 --> 33:47.024
I mean, god -- I mean, you've
always been a little freak,

33:47.026 --> 33:48.291
But none of us ever thought
that you could...

33:48.293 --> 33:51.395
<i>God almighty, chris!</i>

33:51.397 --> 33:53.363
We are tiptoeing right to
the edge of the constitution,

33:53.365 --> 33:55.565
Eavesdropping in on
an attorney and his client.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.068
He's not the client --
his wife is.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.070
It doesn't feel right.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.805
Conversations with her lawyer
are sacrosanct.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.975
Her husband's conversations
with his brother are not.

34:04.977 --> 34:07.477
<i>Mick, you've got this</i>
<i>all wrong.</i>

34:07.479 --> 34:08.979
You're not even asking
for my side of the story.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.814
No, I don't have it wrong,
and you don't have a side!

34:10.816 --> 34:13.550
Now, you listen -- robyn doesn't
want to testify against you,

34:13.552 --> 34:15.685
But she will
if you blame her for this.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.687
Robyn doesn't want to
testify against me?

34:17.689 --> 34:19.356
That's touching.
What could she say?

34:19.358 --> 34:20.757
That you took
one of the plastic bags

34:20.759 --> 34:22.392
That she uses to store
her art supplies,

34:22.394 --> 34:24.027
Replaced it with drugs
that you laced with poison,

34:24.029 --> 34:25.662
And then exchanged it
for one just like it

34:25.664 --> 34:27.597
In konstantin's locker,

34:27.599 --> 34:29.900
Which is, I am sure,
exactly what you did.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.902
And you would believe
a story like that

34:31.904 --> 34:33.837
From a woman
who's a child molester,

34:33.839 --> 34:35.705
Who did ecstasy
with a minor?

34:35.707 --> 34:37.007
She says she loved him.

34:37.009 --> 34:39.443
Let me tell you
her version of love.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.078
That boy was 16 years old
when she started screwing him!

34:41.080 --> 34:42.913
That's not love!

34:42.915 --> 34:45.549
They did ecstasy together, and
she was screwing her students

34:45.551 --> 34:47.584
While the rest of our family
was at mass!

34:47.586 --> 34:49.953
Remember when she stopped going
to church on Sunday nights?

34:49.955 --> 34:51.855
<i>It was to see the kid!</i>
<i>So this is why you got</i>
<i>mr. Harris</i>

34:51.857 --> 34:54.424
To bring in his brother
to represent the suspect.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.027
Sharon: If robyn harris is as
smart as everyone thinks she is,

34:57.029 --> 34:59.062
Why would she keep
poison in her house

34:59.064 --> 35:00.897
And evidence
on her laptop?

35:00.899 --> 35:04.301
And who else could manage
to plant a plastic bag

35:04.303 --> 35:06.303
With her fingerprints on it
somewhere?

35:06.305 --> 35:09.005
Harris found out
what his wife was up to...

35:10.775 --> 35:12.909
...Probably by
reading her e-mails

35:12.911 --> 35:14.778
On the computer
he bought her.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.314
Not to mention, he has keys
to all the kids' lockers.

35:18.549 --> 35:21.118
He opened them for us
during our search this morning.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.227
Buzz:
The controls for the school's
cameras are in his office.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.196
He can turn them on and off.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.902
Anyway, I'm giving
you fair warning.
I am representing robyn.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.738
You need to get
some serious help --

35:41.740 --> 35:43.573
Not just a lawyer,
but a psychiatrist --

35:43.575 --> 35:44.774
And I would get that
all in order

35:44.776 --> 35:46.176
Before
robyn's arraignment.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.178
You're choosing her
over me?

35:48.180 --> 35:50.413
I'm your brother.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.315
I'm your brother.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.351
That's something
I can't fix.

Could you please
go arrest chris harris?

36:07.365 --> 36:09.699
And what do we do
with his wife?

36:09.701 --> 36:11.968
Given that she had sex
with a minor, captain,

36:11.970 --> 36:14.704
I think it might be easier
for you if I dealt with her.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.541
Would you like me
to wrap this up?

36:17.543 --> 36:20.277
Actually, that would
be very nice. Thank you.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.890
You're going to jail,
mrs. Harris.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.193
The only question is,
for how long?

36:36.195 --> 36:37.827
She didn't kill
those boys.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.897
No, but when she decided to
start having sex with a minor,

36:40.899 --> 36:42.566
She created
a motive for murder.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.568

no, I-I didn't decide anything.

36:44.570 --> 36:48.138
It just happened.
I knew it was wrong.

36:48.140 --> 36:51.141
But at the time...

36:51.143 --> 36:54.177
It felt true.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.179
My brother was a jerk.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.848
All right, she was lonely.
Trust me. She was lonely.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.051
And age isn't always
so fixed.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.320
Have you read
any of byron's poetry?

37:03.322 --> 37:06.823
He was involved
with a much younger girl --

37:06.825 --> 37:08.158
Save the english lecture
for the jury.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.993
I'm sure they'll be
very impressed.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.095
On the other hand,
they might feel like me,

37:12.097 --> 37:13.330
And I'm too disgusted

To stay in the same room

for your testimony,

you're a sex offender.

Is that what you want?

what love made you do,

Are you kidding me?

This evaluation is
