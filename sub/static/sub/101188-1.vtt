WEBVTT

00:34.910 --> 00:37.412
Hey, babe, are these expired?

00:43.168 --> 00:45.170
Still got it, you fucking slut.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.096
Okay, so, what if I'm, like,
a flight attendant,

00:54.179 --> 00:56.890
and we're on this long-haul
international flight,

00:56.974 --> 00:58.976
and you're, like...
you're, like, this, like,

00:59.059 --> 01:01.478
handsy, entitled first-class passenger?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.230
- Oh, yeah. So, wait.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.816
So, I'm grabbing you, like,
in front of everyone, or...?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.944
- Um... No. Okay, good point.
Maybe it's like, you know, uh...

01:09.027 --> 01:11.280
Like, "Sir, you can't be
back here in the cockpit.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.656
"Or the vestibule thing

01:12.739 --> 01:14.116
"where the flight attendants hang out.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.617
Whatever that's called."
- So it's kind of like,

01:15.701 --> 01:16.910
"Uh, excuse me, miss.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.371
I'm gonna need you to warm up these nuts."

01:19.454 --> 01:21.456
- Oh, I hated that.
- Ooh.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.292
- I'm never gonna fuck you again.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.252
How do you have two Emmys for writing?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.503
- What are you talking about?
We both know

01:26.587 --> 01:28.172
you wouldn't date me
if I didn't have those Emmys.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.465
- That is not true.
That's so mean.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.967
I am not dating you for Emmys.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.178
I am dating you because...

01:34.261 --> 01:37.848
you have a really nice house
and I really hate my apartment.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.737
What is this, like...

01:51.820 --> 01:53.655
sequin glitter thing?
- Uh... it's probably

01:53.739 --> 01:55.324
from one of your, uh...
- Where'd this even come from?

01:55.407 --> 01:58.327
I don't fuck with glitter, man.
What? Like...

01:58.410 --> 02:00.204
Oh, did you go to a strip club
or something?

02:00.287 --> 02:01.914
- What? No!
- No, I-I...

02:01.997 --> 02:03.123
We've been to strip clubs.
I have no problem

02:03.207 --> 02:04.333
with strip clubs.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.751
No, I haven't been to a strip club.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.336
I haven't been to any...
- Okay.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.837
Then are you cheating on me?

02:08.921 --> 02:11.006
- No. Oh, my God. I'm not cheating on you.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.966
- Okay, well, this is weird.
Where did this...?
- I have a sex doll.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.678
- You what?

02:16.762 --> 02:18.972
- I have a sex doll.

02:19.056 --> 02:23.143
That I barely ever even...

02:23.227 --> 02:25.604
use, and, uh...
- Oh.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.814
- There's this one dress with sparkles.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.191
- Yeah, okay.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.068
- That probably one fell off, maybe.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.194
- Yeah.
- And, um...

02:32.277 --> 02:33.654
- No, that's totally fine. Um...

02:33.737 --> 02:35.072
- Well, it-it...

02:35.155 --> 02:37.199
it doesn't seem like it's fine with you.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.118
- No. No. I'm just, uh...
I'm-I'm just processing.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.120
- I didn't tell you about it,
I didn't think

02:42.204 --> 02:44.039
to tell you about it
'cause it's... it's no big deal.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.541
I mean, it's like porn or something.
- Yeah.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.042
No.
- It's a Fleshlight with boobs

02:47.125 --> 02:48.585
that I got off of a Japanese website.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.629
- Ooh. She's from Japan.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.172
Very international woman.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.298
Is her name Kimiko?

02:53.382 --> 02:55.092
- Oh, my God.
- Is she hotter than me?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.176
Like, be honest. Like, if she's hot...
- Cody. Cody.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.219
- If Kimiko's hotter than me...

02:57.302 --> 02:59.012
- Now you're mocking me.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.390
- Sorry. I'm not trying to kink-shame you.
I'm sorry

03:01.473 --> 03:02.933
if that's what it felt like.
- No, no, no.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.434
- I have a million fetishes.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.187
I love this part of our relationship.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.940
I love that we do
all this weird shit together.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.108
Really.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.402
I love that.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.654
Can I just see her?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.906
- No.
- Why not?

03:17.990 --> 03:20.742
- It's my private gross thing.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.161
Like the shit you took this morning.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.747
And I know you took a shit this
morning because we have honesty.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.791
I don't know what color it was...

03:27.875 --> 03:29.793
because of privacy.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.128
- Okay.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.796
I mean, obviously, brown.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.798
- You...

03:34.882 --> 03:37.759
- I hear you.
This is a boundary.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.721
It's all good. We're all good.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.723
We're good.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.147
- You still want to, uh...?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.149
- Um...

03:52.232 --> 03:54.484
I don't know, I'm kind of tired.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.530
- Tired enough for...

03:58.614 --> 04:01.909
sexy autopsy?

04:01.992 --> 04:03.911
- Yeah, okay.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.371
So, am I, like, a pretty corpse,
or am I, like, all fucked-up?

04:06.455 --> 04:07.789
- You're fucked-up.
- Okay.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.003
Baby.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.088
Dan.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.800
Dan? You're snoring.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.802
Can you roll on your side, please?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.320
- Hey!

05:28.078 --> 05:29.580
- Hello?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.914
- Psst!

05:30.998 --> 05:33.500
I'm in here.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.918
I can hear you.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.920
I know you're out there.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.590
You breathe, like, really heavy.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.930
Hey!

05:47.973 --> 05:50.017
Sup?

05:52.102 --> 05:54.021
- Um...

05:54.104 --> 05:56.190
Kimiko?

05:56.273 --> 05:57.608
- Who's Kimiko?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.027
- Holy shit. Oh, um...

06:00.110 --> 06:03.030
Well, I mean, I...

06:03.113 --> 06:06.283
I, like, jokingly named you Kimi... Kimiko

06:06.366 --> 06:07.826
'cause you were made in Japan.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.536
- Oh, my God.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.914
That's, like, really fucking racist.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.041
- Oh, n... I mean...

06:14.124 --> 06:16.418
Like, I only said it
in front of Dan, so...

06:16.502 --> 06:18.587
- Okay. Well,
that doesn't make it any better.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.047
Uh, anyway, hi.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.757
Hello. I'm Barbara.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.175
Barbara Himmelbaum-Harmon.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.343
- Barbara. Okay.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.261
Barbara, sorry. I'm so sorry.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.638
- It's okay. It's fine.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.264
It's fine, girl.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.434
Actually, you know what?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.561
There is something you could do
that would really help me out.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.355
Just so that you can make it up
to me because you're racist

06:36.438 --> 06:37.523
and that was really offensive.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.317
So, I have, like, a ton of Dan's splooge

06:40.400 --> 06:41.485
dried up inside of me.
- What?

06:41.568 --> 06:42.611
- Yeah.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.531
It's so cute.
Dan comes inside of me

06:45.614 --> 06:46.865
a lot, and then, like, I think

06:46.949 --> 06:48.200
he gets so caught up in the passion

06:48.283 --> 06:49.868
that he actually forgets to wash me.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.120
Like, he'll wipe the outside
of me with a T-shirt sometimes,

06:52.204 --> 06:53.830
- but he doesn't even always do that.
- What? Oh, my God.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.458
- Look. Girl, look how crusty it is.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.964
- Fuck, gross!
- I know, right?

07:02.047 --> 07:04.299
You would do me, like,
a huge favor if you'd wash me.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.343
- No! No. Dude, absolutely not.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.095
I... I can't move you.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.347
He can't even know that I saw you.
Like, fuck.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.182
Our whole, like,
mission statement as a couple

07:12.266 --> 07:13.767
is, like, honesty and no lies,

07:13.851 --> 07:16.103
and I've totally invaded
his privacy already. Fuck!

07:16.186 --> 07:18.105
- Right. Like, I hear you,
but do you really want him

07:18.188 --> 07:19.731
to fuck you with his dick
after it's been inside

07:19.815 --> 07:20.983
this crusty pussy?

07:21.066 --> 07:24.236
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Barbara!
I don't know.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.989
Like, he takes showers or whatever.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.533
- Yeah, but you can't shower an infection
out of the dickhole, dumbass.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.159
This has happened to friends of mine.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.661
He's gonna get a disease from fucking

07:32.744 --> 07:34.496
his own dried-up jizz flakes.
- Oh, my God.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.124
- And then he's gonna pass that disease on
to your vibrant, living pussy.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.500
You're gonna have to go to your doctor.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.878
You're gonna have to explain
what happened.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.754
- Okay. Barbara?
- Yeah.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.298
- Barbara?
Here's what's happening.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.301
I'm a little fucked-up right now
'cause I took, like, expired...

07:47.384 --> 07:50.679
um, these homeopathic,
like, melatonin gummies,

07:50.762 --> 07:52.181
and I've h... I've smoked a lot of weed.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.349
But clearly I'm having, like,
a hallucinatory episode

07:54.433 --> 07:56.602
where you came to life
and, like, beckoned me in here

07:56.685 --> 07:58.270
'cause I just needed to see you,

07:58.353 --> 07:59.563
and I didn't want to take responsibility

07:59.646 --> 08:01.064
for snooping, you know?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.483
So here we are, and, like,
you're super fucking hot.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.985
- Thank you. I know.
- I feel

08:05.068 --> 08:06.153
really insecure about it,

08:06.236 --> 08:07.571
and there's nothing we can do
about that now.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.114
- No, no, no, no, no, there are things!

08:09.198 --> 08:10.199
There is! Babe.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.159
Babe, there's Botox.
There's Juvéderm.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.120
You would benefit so much

08:15.204 --> 08:16.622
from a forehead enlargement.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.415
I don't know if it's a thing.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.833
- Okay, Barbara?

08:19.917 --> 08:22.127
- I'm gonna go ahead
and say your forehead's stocky.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.795
- I'm gonna go back to bed right now,

08:23.879 --> 08:26.798
and when I wake up,
you're gonna be inanimate again,

08:26.882 --> 08:28.675
and I'm gonna buy a new bottle
of melatonin,

08:28.759 --> 08:30.302
and we never have to do this again.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.678
It was so nice meeting you.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.430
- No, no, no, no.
Cody, please, please, please.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.932
Cody, let's just talk about this, girl.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.350
I like you so much.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.186
Cody, you're being
such a dumb cunt right now!
