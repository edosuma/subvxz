WEBVTT

00:05.373 --> 00:09.074
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:17.084 --> 00:20.152
Fundamentally,
the Families First bill

00:20.154 --> 00:22.755
will help our
most vulnerable kids,

00:22.757 --> 00:26.258
like the little boy
in Seattle who asked Santa

00:26.260 --> 00:30.062
to teach him how to read
for Christmas.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.163
How did he write the note?

00:31.165 --> 00:34.633
Or the little girl
down in Pine Hill, Alabama.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.636
She's HIV positive
via breast milk,

00:37.638 --> 00:41.640
but who still dreams
of becoming a ballerina.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.575
Well, they do need to stay thin.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.511
- Selina: <i>And why shouldn't they?</i>
- What? They do.

00:45.513 --> 00:50.382
We want to give all kids
a reason to dance, you know?

00:53.788 --> 00:55.387
- Dan: <i>Sir.</i>
- Ben: <i> Yes?</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:56.388
- The HIV girl.
- Yes?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.090
The one that the president
mentioned in the CBS interview.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.658
- Yes?
- All right, well, some people on Reddit

00:59.660 --> 01:03.295
put the details together, now the
whole town knows who she is.

01:03.297 --> 01:03.796
Fuck!

01:03.798 --> 01:06.065
I preferred the Internet
when it was just AltaVista

01:06.067 --> 01:07.599
and that little Star Wars kid.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.368
- Did we definitely out this girl?
- Yeah.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.637
- Shit.
- Only her doctor and her principal knew.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.405
Now parents are keeping
their kids home from school

01:13.407 --> 01:15.207
'cause they don't want them
to, quote, "catch AIDS."

01:15.209 --> 01:17.643
Well, there's a town
with no Gay Pride parade

01:17.645 --> 01:18.644
or a goddamn library.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.380
Where did this data come from? How
did we get her medical records?

01:21.382 --> 01:23.515
And why didn't we ask
her parents' permission?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.583
Oh, thank you, Question Man.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.718
You just saved the entire city.
Or did you?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.854
This is catching fire
like a gas station

01:28.856 --> 01:30.289
- in a Michael Bay movie.
- Yeah.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.092
- What's our line here?
- Do we tell the president?

01:33.094 --> 01:34.193
- No.
- No?

01:34.195 --> 01:35.527
No, she's gonna panic.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.496
We got to find out
more facts, all right?

01:37.498 --> 01:40.099
- Bozos, disassemble.
- All right.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.602
I always feel like the ruching on this
one really accentuates your figure.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.504
Okay, you're right.
Let's go with that.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.239
Okay, I'll have the valet
lay this out for you.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.208
- No, you can do it.
- Oh. ( laughs )

01:49.210 --> 01:51.210
- Reminds me of an easier time, you know?
- Right.

01:51.212 --> 01:55.347
- ( chuckles ) - Or a time whose
problems I've suppressed.

01:55.349 --> 01:55.881
Right.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.584
Oh, there's my favorite
slice of fun.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.486
Look at this.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.855
What is this?

02:03.491 --> 02:05.390
Catherine, you are smoking?

02:05.392 --> 02:07.659
I'm vaping.
That's not the point.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.161
This has been
happening every week.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.230
My private life
should be off-limits.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.532
I see that you
are still seeing Jason.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.834
He photographs well for his age.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.237
Ma'am, the Apple Growers
Association

02:18.239 --> 02:20.506
would like to name a new
brand of apple after you.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.607
Is it a good apple?

02:21.609 --> 02:22.808
- It's a baking apple.
- Fuck 'em.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.612
Oh, and Bill Ericsson wants to see you
before you leave about Catherine.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.714
- The smoking photograph.
- Vaping.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.749
Actually, there is a
Photoshopped image in the "Post"

02:30.751 --> 02:36.188
of what you and Catherine might look
like if you had eight years in power.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.557
Oh, my God, I look like Grandpa.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.492
What?
( gasps )

02:40.494 --> 02:42.561
<i>What did they do to my nose?</i>

02:42.563 --> 02:44.563
- Mom, what about me?
- Huh?

02:44.565 --> 02:47.799
Yeah, I know.
This is so disrespectful.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.735
Where is Mike? Is he
still doing his gaggle?

02:49.737 --> 02:51.837
- Yes, he's gaggling, ma'am.
- All right.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.372
Will the president be commenting

02:53.374 --> 02:56.508
on this breaking story
about little Jennifer Graham?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.476
Uh, yes.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.212
We will very soon have
a statement on that.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.248
Reporter: <i> The White House released
the girl's private information.</i>

03:03.250 --> 03:04.650
Where did this confidential
data come from?

03:04.652 --> 03:08.654
I know that the president
confirmed that she does have HIV.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.956
And... the girl,
that is, has HIV.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.926
But the provenance of that
data has yet to be determined.

03:13.928 --> 03:17.629
- Ma'am, Mike is just... - Yeah, I
know, he's fluffing the hacks.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.965
- Ma'am, this isn't a good time.
- Hi, everybody.

03:19.967 --> 03:24.236
Is Mike sharing his
donut holes with y'all?

03:24.238 --> 03:25.737
( laughing )

03:25.739 --> 03:28.473
And, Lyle, I hope
that you're gonna bring

03:28.475 --> 03:29.942
your daughter
to the Easter egg roll.

03:29.944 --> 03:33.545
Oh, thank you for remembering
I have a daughter, ma'am.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.580
Oh, of course, yeah.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.315
- And also my name.
- Yes.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.617
- It's Lyle.
- It's Lyle and it's my pleasure.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.885
Hey, you know,
speaking of daughters,

03:39.887 --> 03:42.287
I just wanted
to mention Catherine.

03:42.289 --> 03:43.855
<i>I know that she's
the First Daughter,</i>

03:43.857 --> 03:46.792
but I would be very
grateful if you guys

03:46.794 --> 03:51.597
would just give her a little bit
of space in her private life.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.232
I mean, you know,
I'm the rock star.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.933
- She's not the rock star.
- ( laughing )

03:54.935 --> 03:57.502
So, thanks, I appreciate it.
Great to see everybody.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.339
With respect, ma'am, do you
think those same privacies

04:00.341 --> 04:04.309
should be given to an
eight-year-old girl with HIV?

04:04.311 --> 04:06.445
Um, well...

04:06.447 --> 04:08.513
HIV is a terrible burden

04:08.515 --> 04:13.819
and I'm very happy to be helping
families who are affected by it.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.354
That is off the record.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.356
Bill: Okay, this
briefing is over.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.659
Nice to see you guys. I'll see
you at the Easter egg roll.

04:20.661 --> 04:24.596
- My... my friend, yes.
- <i>Lyle.</i>

04:25.499 --> 04:27.299
What the hell?

04:27.301 --> 04:28.734
Where did HIV come from?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.937
I think some guy
fucked a monkey.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.339
Jesus Christ!

04:34.341 --> 04:35.974
Why didn't you warn me
about that, Mike?

04:35.976 --> 04:38.543
Ma'am, I tried to
right when you came in.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.812
- No, you didn't.
- You're right, I didn't.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.381
- I should have.
- That's right.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.284
- You were right, ma'am.
- Yeah, no, you didn't warn me at all.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.653
What the fuck is happening?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.587
It's a data breach.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.289
Medical, Social Security
records were hacked

04:50.291 --> 04:54.559
by someone working for us and then put
into the Families First press pack.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.995
That's not just a breach.
That's a data rupture.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.964
All of these words
are meaningless to me.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.700
Here's what we're gonna do.
It's an outrageous idea.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.703
Let's find the person who's
responsible and let's fire them.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.572
Ma'am, there's so much data
fluidity on this project,

05:07.574 --> 05:09.007
the culprit will be
hard to pin down.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.876
Well, the press doesn't
need <i> the</i> culprit.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.311
The press needs <i>a</i> culprit.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.413
You know, there are
hordes of young women

05:14.415 --> 05:16.081
who roam the halls
of the West Wing.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.383
- Yes? - 15% of them
were hired to be fired.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.419
Yeah. We call them
the Expendabelles.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.920
- ( laughs )
- That's not funny, boys.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.057
- No.
- Okay, Dan, go sacrifice a virgin.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.758
Just another Saturday night.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.796
- That's not funny, Amy.
- What? Why not?

05:31.398 --> 05:35.100
Hey, Egan, is somebody gonna
get fired over this AIDSnami?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.668
Oh, yeah.
And I'm in charge

05:36.670 --> 05:38.437
of the canning, Jonah.
I'm the Dan who can.

05:38.439 --> 05:42.574
Okay, well, I was only involved in the
Families First bill via you, so...

05:42.576 --> 05:44.843
What about your side dick here?
You tell him stuff?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.879
Oh, God, yes. He was more
involved than I was.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.648
He was up to his thighs in it.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.416
I don't think I was, sir.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.751
How's the view from
down there, you snake?

05:52.753 --> 05:56.054
- It's harsh.
- Oh, harsh? We need to be a unified front.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.824
Uh, what are you guys
doing right now?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.460
We're working on the veep's
walk-on music for tonight.

06:01.462 --> 06:05.597
- The Police. - Law and order
mixed with very mild reggae.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.598
It's like a comforting balance.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.735
Hey, Jonah, how would you like to
be a little more involved tonight?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.738
Supervise the balloons,
the streamers, the fireworks?

06:12.740 --> 06:13.772
- All right.
- Yeah?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.073
You know I got an eye for that.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.475
That's why I'm such
a good photographer.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.444
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- And I love fireworks.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.581
The noise, the lights.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.683
Mostly those aspects.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.651
All right, look, I'm gonna
text you about this later.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.522
Right now I've gotta go. This
goat's not gonna scape itself.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.690
I feel persecuted.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.693
I'm just waiting for the press
to throw me in a pond

06:34.695 --> 06:35.827
to see if I'll float.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.629
Honeymoon's over, isn't it?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.998
It was kind of
a shitty honeymoon, too.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.834
Just like my actual
honeymoon with Daddy.

06:42.836 --> 06:43.668
I know, Mom.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.938
"The Onion" did a parody
of that photo in the "Post."

06:46.940 --> 06:48.874
Oh, really?
I like "The Onion."

06:48.876 --> 06:50.742
What you'll look like
when you're leaving office,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.945
except you look
exactly like you do now.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.646
Okay.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.182
They think you'll only be
president for a few months.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.652
- That's the joke.
- No, no, I get it, yeah.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.988
That's funny.
That's funny stuff.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.923
Man on TV: <i>My girl's
had her life ruined.</i>

07:04.925 --> 07:07.893
How did the president find out
about her information?

07:07.895 --> 07:09.895
This thing has gotten
way too big.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.496
It's like my mom's cat.

07:11.498 --> 07:12.998
The president is just
trying to help children.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.569
I don't understand why everyone keeps
focusing on the negative, you know?

07:17.571 --> 07:20.105
Maybe because, Gary,
we ruined a girl's life.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.506
Negative, negative, negative.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.841
Mike, the National Parents Group

07:22.843 --> 07:27.546
cut the cord on supporting Families
First at next week's press event.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.847
Great, now parents hate us.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.082
Oh, God, welcome
to my childhood.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.784
And adulthood, actually.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.085
We need to shut the story down.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.954
I'm aware of that.
Thank you, Sue.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.155
Well, why haven't
you shut it down?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.890
<i>If you see a fire,
do you look at the fire</i>

07:38.892 --> 07:42.661
and put it out or do you
just say, "I'm aware of it"?

07:42.663 --> 07:45.864
Sue cannot tell me
how to do my job.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.966
She just did.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.701
Richard:
<i>Oh, I bet this baby</i>

07:49.703 --> 07:52.871
could sure spill a lot
of glitter, am I right?

07:52.873 --> 07:53.705
Put it down.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.073
That thing goes off
in your face,

07:55.075 --> 07:57.576
the surgeon will be
tweezering tiny shamrocks

07:57.578 --> 07:59.478
out of your eye jelly
for a week.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.812
Hello, sir.
Jonah Ryan.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.481
Now, I cannot tell you
who we represent,

08:02.483 --> 08:05.617
but let's just go so far as to say
that my boss is a powerful guy,

08:05.619 --> 08:07.819
and his boss, I cannot
stress her power...

08:07.821 --> 08:09.254
I get it.
He's VP Doyle,

08:09.256 --> 08:11.590
she's temporary President Meyer.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.991
You think confetti
and a disco ball's

08:12.993 --> 08:14.759
gonna keep those clowns
in the White House?

08:14.761 --> 08:18.563
Well, sir, if you would like us
to take our business elsewhere...

08:18.565 --> 08:20.732
Grow up, huh?
I do anyone.

08:20.734 --> 08:24.002
I did balloons for
Jerry Ford in '76.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.737
Met him.
Asshole.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.006
So what can you organize for us?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.775
- There's the Presidential.
- Oh, that sounds perfect.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.078
That's bottom of the range.
You don't want that.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.515
I just named it Presidential
because of that asshole Ford.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.517
We've been told
to really go to town.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.852
Well, then you want
the Star-Spangled Banger.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.554
Or Red, White,
and Whoo-hoo.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.958
Now, will we have some sort of
creative control over the music?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.628
I don't give a shit, son.
I still get paid.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.097
Let me show you what we got.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.270
- There she is.
- Hey.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.772
- Hey, I'm excited.
- Okay. Good.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.873
I'll warm them up for you.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.275
Question is, how hot
do you want them?

09:03.277 --> 09:05.810
- Red hot.
- Gonna do the snail joke, right?

09:05.812 --> 09:08.013
That's your trademark joke.
Signature joke.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.749
Yeah, you don't have
to do the snail joke.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.583
It's so funny.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.118
Uh, Andrew, listen.
Let me ask you something.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.054
Do you think this HIV girl
thing is killing us or what?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.556
No, no, no.
You're gonna be fine.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.659
Look, the news moves so quickly,
we'll have a new iPhone

09:20.661 --> 09:25.030
or the Chinese
will be in Chicago.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.902
- Amy, can I talk to you a sec?
- Sure.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.039
Doyle's using "Every Breath You
Take" for his walk-on music.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.708
He loves that song. He got
married to it both times.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.677
Every line ends with
"I'll be watching you."

09:38.679 --> 09:40.011
Sting might as well be singing

09:40.013 --> 09:44.583
"I'll access your medical data"
in a fake Jamaican accent.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.920
You having fun?

09:48.922 --> 09:49.888
Yes, ma'am.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.090
- But also working hard.
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.859
- Thank you for asking.
- It's Chloe?

09:54.861 --> 09:56.661
- It's Ellie.
- Lee.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.929
- Lee.
- Lee?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.731
- Lee.
- Ah.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.865
You can't change the music.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.701
It's all cued up
with the light show.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.369
Fuck the light show,
Jonah, okay?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.638
He's the vice president,
not the new Lexus.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.006
- Fuck the light show?
- Yeah, fuck it.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.209
Be careful, Mr. Ryan. It burns your hand
even through the corrugated sleeve.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.178
- Can you do this?
- Is there a way to change

10:13.180 --> 10:15.380
Doyle's music without
screwing up the lights?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.648
- Oh, absolutely.
- Great.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.284
Well, I'm not sure, but
positivity is the first step.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.719
- Love it.
- Change it to what?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.387
- Doesn't matter.
- I honestly have no idea.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.688
What do you have on your phone?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.023
Well, it's mostly
self-help audio books

10:25.025 --> 10:27.959
and relaxation tapes.
I'm quite an anxious man.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.195
<i>Oh, you know what?
I've got movie themes.</i>

10:30.197 --> 10:31.696
I'll cue
"Eye of the Tiger."

10:31.698 --> 10:34.899
Okay, guys, guys.
"Eye of the Tiger"?

10:34.901 --> 10:38.103
Any controversial
lyrics in that?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.305

- Do it. Do it.

I don't know what's happened.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.716
You know, I usually use a Mac,

11:09.302 --> 11:11.302
Another blunder to
undermine my campaign.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.272
It's not a blunder. It was
an unfortunate mistake.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.908
Yes, the definition
of a blunder, so...

11:16.910 --> 11:19.744
- Right.
- Nobody listens to the words anyways.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.218

Girl in the writers' room

and she is a fine staffer.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.295
Great on close reading

- And anyway, it's not Lee, it's Catherine.
- What?

13:52.999 --> 13:57.068
She wants to work with
an anti-bullying charity.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.624
Yes, ma'am. I've been fattening
him up for just this occasion.

Off with his fat head.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.668
I can easily link him to the
whole data breach thing.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.670

what's going on. - Excuse me.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.605

in the middle of speaking?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.706
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.242
And plus he's got that
whole inherently guilty look.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.278
You know, that kind of
surprised masturbator face.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.213
- The...
- Yeah, he does.

15:49.215 --> 15:52.984
Do it. Get rid of him.
Throw him under a bus.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.987

that's long enough.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.358
Hey, Egan, VP wants
to see the P.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.126
He thinks a bigger head
needs to roll, okay?

16:02.128 --> 16:05.029
Like a massive
Easter Island-sized head.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.731
- Hmm.
- No. No.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
Look at me,
I've got a small head.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.468
I could wear a child's hat.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.536
Besides...

16:11.538 --> 16:14.138
I know about you spreading the
Danny Chung torture rumor.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.974
Well, that's useless
leverage right now, Jonah,

16:15.976 --> 16:17.275
because you have all
the credibility of someone

16:17.277 --> 16:20.044

records of a sick child.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.479
- No...
- Hey, "I Am Groot,"

16:21.481 --> 16:23.381
stop swapping spit here
with "Pretty Woman"

16:23.383 --> 16:24.582

16:24.584 --> 16:26.617
Absolutely. Sorry, I was just
on my way to go do that.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.220
It's an important meeting, okay?
It's seminal.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.655

16:48.641 --> 16:50.141
Nothing.
It's just jock stuff.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.709
You know, just guys having fun.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.578
That isn't, Jonah.
That's sexual harassment.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.314
Jesus, does he do that
to you all the time?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.549
No, not all the time.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.119
Sometimes, but not all the time.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.120
It's just high spirits.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.088
Mr. Ryan, so they were
out of tuna melts,

17:04.089 --> 17:07.625
so I improvised and I got you
this lobster curry roll.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.093
All right, look, zip it, Jeeves.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.595

17:10.597 --> 17:12.663
Wow, over the campaign
data thing?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.665
- The what?
- The I Care mailer.

17:15.667 --> 17:16.634
All right, no?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.435
I'm picking up from your facial
cues that you don't know.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.571
Here's four verbal cues for
you... "Tell me now, asshole."

17:21.574 --> 17:27.211
Well, that mailer was deliberately
directed at recently bereaved parents.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.046
Bereaved parents?

17:28.048 --> 17:30.448
Yeah, someone from the campaign
used the child mortality data

17:30.450 --> 17:33.384
from the same data breach
that identified the HIV girl.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.585
Okay, Yogi and Boo-Boo,

17:34.587 --> 17:36.788
you say nothing to anybody.
You understand me?

17:36.790 --> 17:40.792
- Yes. - Well, obviously you don't,
'cause you just fucking spoke.

17:40.794 --> 17:41.726
- Oh.
- Shit!

17:41.728 --> 17:44.595
Amy, the gates of hell have
opened and you are my plus one.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.564
You cannot be associated
with bullying

17:46.566 --> 17:50.435
because people are going to think
that you were bullied by me.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.704
I wasn't bullied by you,
I was bullied because of you.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.373
Did you want me to leave?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.307
- No, no.
- Yes.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.675
No, you weren't, sweetheart.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.710
Yes, I was and it was miserable.

17:59.712 --> 18:03.181
Well, I apologize
for my success, Catherine.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.117
I had no idea
until this very moment

18:06.119 --> 18:10.488
that you had a tortured,
unhappy, miserable upbringing.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.157
You're gonna have to drop the
bullying thing, though, honey.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.626
No, I'm not gonna drop it.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.832
Do you want to go
to Hawaii at Thanksgiving?

18:20.834 --> 18:23.334
Are you interested in
Memaw's sapphire earrings?

18:23.336 --> 18:28.406
Are you bullying me into dropping
an anti-bullying charity?

18:28.408 --> 18:29.841
Gary, am I?

18:29.843 --> 18:30.875
You're parenting.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.277
Yeah, well, too, I might add.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.480
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.
- Amy: We'll explain later.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.781
No, we won't.
We'll never explain.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.717
Ma'am, Catherine needs to leave.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.586
Okay, Catherine, up, out.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.854
For fuck's sake.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.655
All right, that's enough
with the F words.

18:44.657 --> 18:48.526
Thank you very much. I
apologize for her behav...

18:48.528 --> 18:49.660
What is it?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.295
I can't tell you.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.364
Well, great meeting,
then, thanks.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.399
Ma'am, if we tell you,
you'll know,

18:55.401 --> 18:58.903
and if you know,
you'll be implicated.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.406
Well, then,
why don't you tell me

19:02.408 --> 19:07.378
and I'll decide
whether or not I know it?

19:07.380 --> 19:10.681
Ma'am, a direct mail
campaign went out last month

19:10.683 --> 19:12.550
with pictures of you
with babies and children.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.352
Yeah, it was a huge success.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.687
Ma'am, it targeted
recently bereaved parents

19:16.689 --> 19:19.457
using stolen government data.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.829
Well...

19:24.831 --> 19:26.931
that's a federal crime.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.533
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.734
You could go to jail.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.869
Yes, ma'am, we could go to jail.

19:31.871 --> 19:35.540
Yeah,<i> you</i> could go to jail.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.443
( sighs )
Wow.

19:41.915 --> 19:45.316
We're fucked?
Is that what this is?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.418
"I'm afraid it's spread
to the liver" fucked?

19:47.420 --> 19:51.355
Ma'am, we think it was a student volunteer
with a pal at HHS, but he's gone now.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.193
If we can just hold our nerve and
maintain a bunker mentality...

19:55.195 --> 19:57.261
Don't give me that bunker shit.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.496
Hitler went into a bunker.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.799
When he came out, he wasn't
chancellor anymore, was he?

20:01.801 --> 20:02.833
Plus he was dead.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.869
I'll tell you something,
if he were alive right now,

20:04.871 --> 20:08.940
he'd be very anxious to distance
himself from me at this moment.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.875
We need to keep this
within these four...

20:10.877 --> 20:12.310
Or this one curved wall.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.880
We need to stop the press dead so
they don't dig into this any further.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.582
And that means
a major resignation.

20:17.584 --> 20:22.920
A face. Although, if you operate
last in, first out, I'm screwed.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.757
Ma'am, I have a proposal I
need to speak with you about.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.460
Okay, fine.
Amy, Ben, you stay.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.862
Everybody else, just get out.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.864
( sighs )

20:33.866 --> 20:35.833
I need to be the one to go.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.902
You? No, no.
Uh-uh.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.836
Yes, Madam President.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.373
This is a head-on collision
and I'm your biggest air bag.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.743
Okay, so we need to issue a positive
statement about the HIV girl.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.911
Not positive.
Wrong word.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.515
Mike, did I see you smiling when
it was suggested I might be fired?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.718
Me? No.
I... I wasn't smiling.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.621
I was stretching my lips
because I have very dry lips,

20:56.623 --> 20:58.723
and my doctor said, "You
should probably stretch them."

20:58.725 --> 21:00.658
So I was following
medical advice. Like...

21:00.660 --> 21:03.794
- Like that.
- That's what you're going with?

21:03.796 --> 21:06.864
Wow. Listen, you ever
play poker, I want in,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.599
'cause you are
one terrible liar.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.670
And that's sad 'cause
that's your whole job.

21:17.010 --> 21:20.311
Why are you using
the urinal next to me?

21:20.313 --> 21:23.447
- You leave a gap.
- I've already started.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.449
The little one
gives me splash-back.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.854
Still, you leave a gap.
We're not piss buddies.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.391
Damn, that's some kind
of prostate control.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.625
Treasure it, my friend.

21:34.627 --> 21:39.397
So, you want to know if the president
told me who she's firing, right?

21:39.399 --> 21:41.732
- Yeah.
- It's me.

21:41.734 --> 21:45.369
You don't tell anyone until
she's made an announcement.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.338
- You got it?
- Yeah, not a word.

21:47.340 --> 21:51.642
You swear by everything you hold
dear in your hand right now?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.344
I do.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.345
I swear on King Danny.

21:54.347 --> 21:57.548
This is an Easter egg roll and I
just see baskets with no eggs.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.650
Gary, front row
for the story reading

21:59.652 --> 22:01.519
needs to be the children
with the strongest bladders.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.487
- I don't even know what that means.
- Mike: Guys.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.456
- Oh, thank God.
- Why am I carrying eggs, huh?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.658
- I'm up to my eyeballs in HIV.
- No, no, don't give them to me.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.962
There's a six-foot bunny out there
with 30 spoons. You can't miss him.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.437
- It's Ben.
- No way.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.406
No, who's getting fired, Mike.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.407
- What?
- Yeah.

22:23.409 --> 22:26.043
Girl:
<i>I found another one.</i>

22:26.045 --> 22:27.912
Well, thank you
for your service, Greg.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.047
Very happy to have one of
my Marines in costume.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.817
- You're welcome, ma'am.
- Actually, I'm really glad you're here.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.753
These kids terrify me.
( laughs )

22:35.755 --> 22:37.355
But I guess you've seen worse.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.657
You did two tours
of Afghanistan?

22:39.659 --> 22:42.693
Yes, ma'am. I saw my best
buddy die over there.

22:42.695 --> 22:46.030
Blown to pieces by an IED.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.834
Mr. Egan.
You have a moment?

22:49.836 --> 22:52.636
- Sure.
- Ben: Yeah, I'll call you back.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.072
- Hey, Dan.
- I thought you resigned.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.108
I guess the president
changed her mind.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.076
It's a fickle world, my friend,

22:59.078 --> 23:01.612
and you've just been fickled.

23:02.048 --> 23:06.517
No. No, this is not...
This is not real.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.818
You're right, Dan.
It's a dream.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.120
And me and Kent
are about to turn into

23:09.122 --> 23:11.389
two horny cheerleaders
and start making out.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.725
So am I fired? Please, Ben,
don't say that I'm fired.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.460
- You're not fired.
- Oh, thank fuck for that.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.796
- Because you've just resigned.
- It's a perfect fit.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.598
Worked on
the Families First bill

23:20.600 --> 23:23.901
and handsome,
therefore guilty-looking.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.469
No, no. No.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.406
I know about the targeting
of bereaved families

23:28.408 --> 23:29.740
and the use of federal data.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.610
You listen to me, you little
fucking turd's assistant.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.512
You don't threaten
this administration

23:34.514 --> 23:36.781
because we will
fucking destroy you.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.549
We'll skin you like a squirrel,

23:38.551 --> 23:40.151
clean you out like
a dirty fucking chimney,

23:40.153 --> 23:42.987
and wear you like a glove
puppet with my fingers

23:42.989 --> 23:47.525
sticking out of your
dead fucking eyeballs.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.161
I cannot endorse that message,

23:50.163 --> 23:52.563
but I do acknowledge it.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.497
Come inside.

23:53.499 --> 23:56.200
- ( applause )
- Hi, boys and girls.

23:56.202 --> 23:59.503
Now, once upon a time,

23:59.505 --> 24:02.106
there were three little pigs

24:02.108 --> 24:05.042
with their mom,
who was an old sow.

24:05.044 --> 24:09.680
And she sent them out
to seek their fortune.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.649
Yeah, you know what?
I, uh...

24:11.651 --> 24:16.987
I think I'm gonna need a bigger
title before I agree to resign.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.924
How about Captain Loser?

24:19.926 --> 24:22.159
Or Big Chief Skidmark?

24:22.161 --> 24:24.595
And the president will be
making another apology

24:24.597 --> 24:26.197
personally to the family
of Jennifer Graham.

24:26.199 --> 24:30.034
She is a young girl who did not ask
to become a national debating point.

24:30.036 --> 24:34.505
I must be their front-runner. I
already did the job for three years.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.774
- Amy.
- I got to go.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.776
Ben's not going.
It's Dan.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.612
Mike's about to saw off
the healthy leg.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.913
Oh, fuck!

24:42.915 --> 24:45.483
You can be sure that the
president is taking steps

24:45.485 --> 24:48.719
to ensure that appropriate
action will be taken.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.923
"Little pig, little pig,
let me in."

24:52.925 --> 24:53.824
"No, no.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.828
Not by the hair
on my chinny chin chin."

24:57.830 --> 25:00.998
All right, how about Deputy
Assistant to the President?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.600
( chuckles )
That's funny.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.736
Ben, Mike's about
to announce we're firing you.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.171
No, that's funny.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.207
So he huffed and he puffed
and he blew his house in.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.611
Now it's the president's turn
to tell the story, please.

25:13.613 --> 25:17.515
- Child: <i> You're the president?</i>
- Yeah, I'm the president.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.816
Wow.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.719
The Graham family
have requested privacy

25:21.721 --> 25:23.988
and that we allow them
to live a normal life.

25:23.990 --> 25:27.057
Here's the new statement.
Get that to Mike.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.159
I can't run in these heels.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.663
Christian, get that to Mike now!

25:32.665 --> 25:37.101
The person with ultimate
responsibility is...

25:37.670 --> 25:41.305
is Dan Egan, Chief Counsel
to the President?

25:41.307 --> 25:45.042
Come over here, young man. It looks
like you don't feel very good.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.112
- Is that your son?
- He's gifted.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.981
There we go.
Uh-oh.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.249
Oh.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.218
- He did have a big breakfast.
- Okay.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.154
Do you like the story
that I'm reading?

25:57.156 --> 25:58.923
You do?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.859
Child ♪2:
<i>Ew, you guys...</i>

26:01.861 --> 26:03.827
( knocks )
Hey, man.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.564
Yeah, well, you know, enjoy it.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.998
I'm not here to gloat.
I've been through this.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.868
Just tell me which way the
vultures are circling, okay?

26:10.870 --> 26:12.937
There's a big media presence
by the northwest gate.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.004
You want me to grab one?

26:14.006 --> 26:15.606
I'm going out a different door.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.575
Taken enough fucking
heat for one day.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.811
That photo of you with
the kids will play great.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.313
- Oh, it was so good.
- Yeah.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.882
It was like earth mother
meets foster parent

26:24.884 --> 26:26.350
with a hint of girl next door.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.219
- I need a scotch.
- Yes.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.857
There you go.
Stay strong, buddy.

26:33.859 --> 26:36.093
- Thanks.
- Hey, let me get this for you.

26:36.095 --> 26:40.030
- ( reporters clamoring ) - Oh,
God, I meant southeast gate.

26:40.032 --> 26:44.802
- Mr. Egan, do you feel ashamed
of your actions? - Excuse me.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.104
( chuckles )

26:47.106 --> 26:50.007
I thought...
When we discussed,

26:50.009 --> 26:52.743
I thought that it was Ben
who would be going.

26:52.745 --> 26:56.280
Oh, right. Yeah, actually,
Bill suggested Dan.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.682
- Ah.
- <i>He thought it would be a good idea</i>

26:58.684 --> 27:02.386
to keep Ben to take the heat in case
the other data shit hits the fan.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.787
- Good thought, right?
- Yeah.

27:03.789 --> 27:07.625
- Just doing my job.
- Me, too.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.892
Stevie, it's Dan Egan.

27:08.894 --> 27:13.964
So, um... so it looks like
I am a free agent again.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.065
Yeah, so give me a call.

27:15.067 --> 27:18.702
It's the same number
as the last two messages.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.337
Hey, Jen, it's Dan.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.840
Either your phone
is dead or I am.

27:22.842 --> 27:26.343
So obviously I hope
