before, you know,
the donut-shop situation.

18:45.790 --> 18:49.670
I totally get not wanting
to be a disappointment.

18:49.670 --> 18:55.040
Why do you guys think I haven't
come out to my family yet?

18:55.040 --> 18:58.080
I mean, like,
would they still love me? Sure.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.620
But would they look at me
differently?

18:59.620 --> 19:01.420
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.000
I just -- I want to be
their daughter,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.920
not their bisexual daughter.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.250
You got to
live your life out loud

19:09.250 --> 19:11.170
or else you'll end up
like my dad.

19:11.170 --> 19:14.290
Your dad's
a closeted bisexual?

19:14.290 --> 19:16.620
Worse, he's a bum.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.210
Ah, that's messed up.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.380
My guy, when's the last time
you've seen him?

19:21.380 --> 19:23.790
I don't know, in person?

19:23.790 --> 19:26.790
Last week
when he dropped me off.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.500
We Skyped this morning
about our Catalina trip.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.120
Wait, you Skyped?

19:32.120 --> 19:33.210
Oh, my God,
is he one of those

19:33.210 --> 19:34.920
homeless dudes
with a cellphone?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.250
That drives me crazy.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.500
-Me too.
-W-What? No.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.250
W-Well,
then what is it, bro?

19:41.250 --> 19:44.920
Is he a -- he's an alcoholic,
he's on drugs, what's up?

19:44.920 --> 19:46.750
He's a [bleep] cab driver.

19:48.580 --> 19:51.210
A cab driver...
who beats your mom?

19:51.210 --> 19:53.330
No, he worships my mom.

19:53.330 --> 19:55.960
Okay, so, like, in Hindi,
does "bum" mean, like,

19:55.960 --> 19:57.380
a present
and supportive father?

19:57.380 --> 19:59.460
Mm.
That's got to be what it is.
Yeah. Totally.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.960
He's a bum because
he never tried.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.250
He's a smart guy,

20:02.250 --> 20:04.000
but he's been driving that
stupid cab for 35 years.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.960
Dude's got no ambition.

20:05.960 --> 20:10.420
You mean, other than
fleeing a third-world country?

20:10.420 --> 20:13.620
Developing a high-level
understanding of English?

20:13.620 --> 20:15.460
Both: Loving his wife?

20:15.460 --> 20:17.920
And putting his son
through college?

20:22.210 --> 20:24.000
Dude's a bum.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.460
I'm a bad person.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.420
-Huh?
-She said she was a bad person.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.250
Yeah, I heard what she said.
Thank you.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.670
I want to know
why she said it.

20:31.670 --> 20:33.920
Probably 'cause she thinks
she's not a good person.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.420
I don't remember
talking to you, bro.

20:35.420 --> 20:36.540
Why don't you
just shut the --

20:36.540 --> 20:37.710
How about you --

20:37.710 --> 20:40.080
-Hey, you guys.
-You're always talking.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.670
-You guys.
-Flat-top head.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.750
[ Crying, sniffling ]
No, 'cause he's always
doing that.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.000
-Chill out.
-No, he's a--

20:45.000 --> 20:47.330
Hey. Hey.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.040
I'm sorry.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.540
You all right?

20:50.540 --> 20:54.330
I don't know why, but at that
moment, something came over me.

20:54.330 --> 20:57.080
Maybe it was hearing Vivek
talk about his dad,

20:57.080 --> 21:00.420
or Nomi being honest
about her sexuality,

21:00.420 --> 21:01.620
or maybe it was just because

21:01.620 --> 21:04.080
I'd done such a shitty thing
to Ana,

21:04.080 --> 21:07.330
but I felt compelled
to keep opening up.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.380
I realized that the first time
I was out on my own,

21:09.380 --> 21:12.170
the first chance
to make my own decision,

21:12.170 --> 21:13.920
I made the wrong one,

21:13.920 --> 21:15.620
and I had done it so easily.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.540
What did that say about me?

21:17.540 --> 21:19.580
Was that the person
I really was?

21:19.580 --> 21:21.580
The thought of that scared me,

21:21.580 --> 21:23.420
but I wasn't alone
in my feeling.

with nothing in common

21:33.790 --> 21:36.710
look at each other
and see their truest selves

21:36.710 --> 21:39.620

Dear Professor Dr. Telphy,

22:00.330 --> 22:03.580
you asked us to write down
why we're taking this class,

22:03.580 --> 22:06.460
and the honest truth
is we're scared.

22:06.460 --> 22:08.290
Scared that
maybe we're a person

22:08.290 --> 22:10.540
we wouldn't like very much
if we met.

22:10.540 --> 22:14.710
Scared we're people who are
gonna let our communities down.

22:14.710 --> 22:17.420
Scared we're people our parents
might think different of

22:17.420 --> 22:19.330
if they really knew.

22:19.330 --> 22:23.380
Scared of becoming our parents,
and in some of our cases,

22:23.380 --> 22:27.460

22:41.750 --> 22:43.880
that although I would
still make mistakes,

22:43.880 --> 22:45.620
I was determined
to make better choices

22:45.620 --> 22:47.500
and be a better person overall.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.580
Hey, Tara,
what's up with the box?

22:49.580 --> 22:50.920
Oh.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.460
A new single just opened up
over at Cardinal Towers.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.460
I'm out of here.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.880
So you're moving out?

22:55.880 --> 22:57.290
Yep.

22:57.290 --> 22:58.460

It's probably better
for both of us.
