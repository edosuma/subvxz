WEBVTT

03:12.800 --> 03:16.430
Mr. Stern.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.540
Mr. Stern...?

03:42.261 --> 03:45.431
Mr. Stern,
I'm Faye Williams.

03:45.432 --> 03:47.731
We spoke on the phone.

03:47.733 --> 03:50.468
Are you from the barber college?

03:50.469 --> 03:53.469
I'm researching a book
about the diorama killings.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.788
Mind if I set up here?

04:12.789 --> 04:16.358
Uh, yeah.
I'll make some space.

04:36.811 --> 04:40.180
Uh, can I get you a soda
or anything?

04:40.182 --> 04:43.951
No, thank you.
Big martial arts fan?

04:43.952 --> 04:45.686
Uh, yeah.

04:45.687 --> 04:47.787
Um...

04:47.789 --> 04:52.189
I used to watch
a lot of Chuck Norris movies.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.601
Um, I didn't really watch
his television shows,

04:56.602 --> 04:58.965
but I've read his books too...

04:58.966 --> 05:01.866
Except for one.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.709
But... not so much
anymore.

05:17.249 --> 05:19.784
Did you talk to anyone else yet?

05:19.785 --> 05:22.915
Agent Torres is on assignment.

05:22.921 --> 05:25.821
She sent me her deposition.

05:25.824 --> 05:28.593
Tried talking to Krissy,
but wasn't much help.

05:28.594 --> 05:31.994
How's she doin'?

05:33.263 --> 05:35.463
Physically she seems well.

05:42.339 --> 05:45.399
Uh, so how does this work?

05:45.409 --> 05:47.568
Just start from the beginning.

05:49.378 --> 05:51.478
The beginning.

05:52.781 --> 05:56.681
It's kinda hard
to remember the beginning.

05:56.686 --> 06:00.555
The end kinda
overshadows everything.

06:00.556 --> 06:03.266
When did you first know
the murder spree

06:03.267 --> 06:05.919
was moving through your county?

06:05.928 --> 06:07.688
We didn't.

06:07.696 --> 06:10.932
I mean, seemed like everything
was movin' east.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.902
It's not like it was
a direct line through Clay.

06:13.903 --> 06:15.801
Law enforcement in all the areas

06:15.803 --> 06:17.671
were keepin' a lookout.

06:17.672 --> 06:19.602
Nobody wanted that
in their patch.

06:19.607 --> 06:22.437
Due to the sexual nature
of the murders?

06:22.443 --> 06:24.311
The staging?

06:24.312 --> 06:27.811
No. Because nobody wanted
anybody they knew

06:27.814 --> 06:30.983
to end up dead.

06:30.984 --> 06:32.453
Even though it seemed like

06:32.454 --> 06:34.052
he was killing people
who deserved it.

06:34.054 --> 06:35.821
"Deserved it"?

06:35.822 --> 06:37.556
You know what I mean.

06:37.557 --> 06:40.425
It's not like it was
a slaughter of the innocents.

06:40.426 --> 06:42.726
It was hookers, child molesters,

06:42.728 --> 06:44.498
you know, deviants.

06:50.068 --> 06:53.504
We're a godfearing people,
ma'am.

06:53.505 --> 06:56.875
We know what sinning is
and we recognize justice.

07:02.513 --> 07:06.072
When did you call in the FBI?

07:06.083 --> 07:09.743
We didn't.
They just showed up.

07:09.753 --> 07:12.083
Made a bunch of noise,
but nothin' happened.

07:12.089 --> 07:14.757
They headed up north.

07:14.758 --> 07:16.793
Except for agent Torres.

07:16.794 --> 07:19.653
She stayed behind?

07:19.662 --> 07:21.922
She came back.

07:25.434 --> 07:27.364
She had a hunch
the diorama killer

07:27.370 --> 07:29.670
was still in my county.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.349
She was very intuitive.

07:41.582 --> 07:44.852
Though at that point,
we still had no idea.

08:20.618 --> 08:22.648
And that's when it started?

08:22.654 --> 08:25.953
For us, yeah.

08:25.957 --> 08:30.757
I guess it all really started
with a couple on honeymoon

08:30.762 --> 08:33.897
in a red ragtop caddy.

08:41.736 --> 08:47.137
♪ Wish I was a mole
in the ground ♪

08:47.144 --> 08:51.513
♪ wish I was
a mole in the ground ♪

08:51.514 --> 08:54.814
♪ I was a mole
in the ground ♪

08:54.817 --> 08:58.086
♪ I'd root
that mountain down ♪

08:58.087 --> 09:02.787
♪ wish I was a mole
in the ground... ♪

09:07.562 --> 09:09.930
Come on, that was a classic.

09:09.931 --> 09:11.600
That was one
of my favorite songs

09:11.601 --> 09:14.069
in the whole wide world
when I was a kid.

09:14.070 --> 09:17.668
What? When?

09:17.672 --> 09:20.940
When would you have ever
heard that song as a kid?

09:20.941 --> 09:22.941
When I would go visit
my grandmama

09:22.943 --> 09:25.443
and she would sing it to me.

09:27.814 --> 09:29.914
Why do you act
like I don't know anything?

09:29.917 --> 09:31.816
I know a lot of things
from out here.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.752
A lot, a lot.

09:33.753 --> 09:36.923
Oh, I know you do.

09:43.028 --> 09:44.228
Where the hell are we?

09:44.230 --> 09:46.864
Haven't seen a house in forever.

09:46.865 --> 09:49.535
It's kinda spooky.

09:50.801 --> 09:52.531
I would say
in my expert opinion,

09:52.537 --> 09:54.737
we're about five hours away,

09:54.739 --> 09:58.942
which is, uh, 20 minutes since
the last time you asked me.

09:58.943 --> 10:02.512
Smarty pants.

10:02.513 --> 10:06.113
♪ Tell me of a home
where no storm clouds rise ♪

10:06.116 --> 10:10.920

10:40.281 --> 10:42.549
We blew a tire.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.219
Well, get out there and fix it

10:44.220 --> 10:45.818
before we die from the elements

10:45.820 --> 10:47.820
out here in the middle
of frickin' nowhere.

10:47.822 --> 10:49.652
"The elements"?

10:49.657 --> 10:52.616
"Lions and tigers and bears.
Oh, my."

10:52.626 --> 10:54.886
Well, the good thing
is that most cars

10:54.895 --> 10:57.625
have things in the trunk
for these sort of situations.

10:57.631 --> 10:59.961
Ooh.

11:04.036 --> 11:05.195
Pull the trunk lever, baby.

11:05.204 --> 11:08.204
Where is it in this car?

11:08.207 --> 11:12.277
Okay, okay.
I find. I find. Rude.

11:21.618 --> 11:22.918
You know,
if any horror-movie shit

11:22.921 --> 11:24.588
comes out of these woods,

11:24.589 --> 11:27.224
you better lead it away
from the car.

11:27.225 --> 11:28.925
We're like
sitting ducks out here

11:28.927 --> 11:32.226
for roaming bands
of redneck cannibals.

11:32.229 --> 11:33.929
And horseflies.

11:33.931 --> 11:36.331
Did I ever tell you when
we were at that training camp

11:36.333 --> 11:38.633
I totally saw a ufo?

11:38.635 --> 11:40.565
Wha-aa!

11:40.571 --> 11:44.172
Why would you scare me
like that?

11:44.173 --> 11:45.773
Wasn't trying to.

11:45.775 --> 11:48.275
You promised me you wouldn't
do that anymore.

11:52.347 --> 11:55.183
Did you find anything
in the trunk?

11:55.184 --> 11:56.884
Nope.

11:56.886 --> 11:59.155
Nothing but a dead body.
Looks like we're walkin'.

11:59.156 --> 12:01.924
Yeah, that's funny.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.661
What? I don't wanna go walk
out into the wilderness.

12:07.662 --> 12:10.591
We've got shelter
and rations right here.

12:10.598 --> 12:12.268
I mean, it's only one piece,

12:12.269 --> 12:15.136
but it's long-lasting flavor,
though.

12:20.608 --> 12:23.042
Doesn't make sense
for us to wait.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.712
No telling how long
it's gonna take

12:24.713 --> 12:27.041
for somebody else to drive by.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.282
Mm, we could always make use

12:30.283 --> 12:33.623
of this big old back seat.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.223
Chewing my half.

12:36.224 --> 12:39.051
You'll just have
to come get it, then.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.730
Mm.

12:55.238 --> 12:56.668
All right, we gotta go.

12:56.674 --> 12:59.674
Yes.

13:18.726 --> 13:20.656
We been walking forever.

13:22.163 --> 13:24.873
I bet you the only house
we'll even find out here

13:24.874 --> 13:27.135
will be a cannibal's kill shack.

13:27.136 --> 13:29.096
Don't worry.

13:29.104 --> 13:31.163
I've got my knife.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.275
Do you think there's wolves?

13:37.278 --> 13:41.078
Like werewolves?

13:41.082 --> 13:43.216
I don't know about wolves.

13:43.217 --> 13:45.946
Coyotes, maybe.

13:45.952 --> 13:48.752
Well, those skinny little things
will eat you.

13:48.755 --> 13:51.025
Ow!

13:53.826 --> 13:56.795
Tell me about
the "swung" murders.

13:56.796 --> 13:59.464
We got a call.

13:59.465 --> 14:02.133
Another diorama.

14:02.134 --> 14:05.103
Right where agent Torres
said it'd be.

14:05.104 --> 14:07.704
Wife swappers this time.

14:07.707 --> 14:10.276
Looked like our guy
gate-crashed the party

14:10.277 --> 14:12.943
and did some preaching
on morals.

14:12.944 --> 14:15.813
So Torres was right.

14:15.814 --> 14:20.244
Like I said, intuitive.

14:28.191 --> 14:30.351
- Hey.
- What?

14:30.360 --> 14:33.290
Hey, I was almost asleep.

14:33.297 --> 14:35.465
Look what we got here.

14:35.466 --> 14:37.432
What, this?

14:37.433 --> 14:38.963
This a driveway?

14:38.968 --> 14:42.098
It's more like
a hillbilly landing strip.

14:42.105 --> 14:45.045
Hmm. You look like someone
who owes me a ride.

14:45.046 --> 14:47.209
No!

14:47.210 --> 14:49.939
Let's walk.

15:37.155 --> 15:39.485
Huh.

16:47.486 --> 16:50.121
We come in peace!

16:50.122 --> 16:52.452
Hi.
Our tire hit a nail.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.360
I'm not a mechanic.

16:55.361 --> 16:58.491
Just need to borrow basic tools.
You got a Jack?

16:58.497 --> 17:03.100
No, um...
It's broken.

17:03.101 --> 17:07.371
Um, could we just...
Just use your phone?

17:07.372 --> 17:08.571
Maybe to call a tow?

17:08.573 --> 17:11.573
Look, my girl here...

17:11.576 --> 17:13.410
My wife...

17:13.411 --> 17:15.611
Is afraid we might get eaten.

17:15.614 --> 17:17.280
By cannonballs.

17:17.281 --> 17:19.611
- Cannibals.
- Canni-balls.

17:21.117 --> 17:24.347
Where exactly
did your car break down?

17:24.355 --> 17:29.091
Uh, about a mile from here
at the fork.

17:29.092 --> 17:31.492
Ah.

17:48.976 --> 17:51.406
Bet you don't get too many
guests around here.

17:51.413 --> 17:53.047
It's not fair.

17:53.048 --> 17:56.116
You come bustin' in when
my balls are hanging out.

17:56.117 --> 17:59.217
I'm gonna go put my jeans on,
you know?

17:59.220 --> 18:02.120
And, uh, you can
get comfortable.

18:02.123 --> 18:05.183
Sit down.
Just don't touch anything.

18:27.679 --> 18:29.979
We good?

18:56.372 --> 19:00.602
So... do you want me
to call you a tow truck?

19:02.243 --> 19:04.112
Uh...

19:04.113 --> 19:06.543
We failed
to introduce ourselves.

19:06.549 --> 19:10.609
I'm Jeff and this here
is my wife Krissy.

19:12.354 --> 19:15.453
Yeah. Uh, Emery Reed.

19:15.457 --> 19:18.357
Yeah. My phone
is in the other room.

19:18.360 --> 19:21.260
I'm gonna go in there
and call you a tow truck.

19:21.262 --> 19:24.431
And I want you
just to sit right here.

19:24.432 --> 19:26.262
Don't touch anything.

19:26.267 --> 19:31.366
Does your delorean have a Jack?

19:31.372 --> 19:34.507
It's not mine.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.308
Now either you want me
to call you a tow truck,

19:37.311 --> 19:39.011
or y'all can get
the hell outta here.

19:39.013 --> 19:41.147
Your call.

19:41.148 --> 19:44.277
Tow truck would be
real nice, Emery.

19:44.283 --> 19:48.387
Whose is it?
Does it go back in time?

19:48.388 --> 19:50.648
I have some stuff I would redo.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.216
I bet you would.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.644
Yeah, the world's full of 'em.

20:14.645 --> 20:16.805
Thanks, Tonya.

20:16.814 --> 20:19.474
Should be a truck here
in a little while.

20:19.483 --> 20:22.082
Actually, it might take 'em
a couple hours.

20:22.085 --> 20:24.615
Y'all want
a cup of coffee or tea?

20:24.621 --> 20:28.461
Coffee would be nice, Emery.

20:35.496 --> 20:38.733
The FBI suspected that Elam Gill

20:38.734 --> 20:41.334
was the first victim.

20:41.336 --> 20:43.066
Why?

20:43.072 --> 20:45.432
The murder scenes
were very different.

20:45.441 --> 20:49.100
Gill wasn't as obviously staged.

20:49.110 --> 20:53.570
Gill wasn't a nice man.

20:53.581 --> 20:55.741
He used the children of sunshine

20:55.750 --> 20:59.350
to feed his perversion.

20:59.353 --> 21:01.822
Little kids.

21:06.392 --> 21:12.362
All the victims shared
some level of sexual deviance.

21:12.365 --> 21:14.233
Agent Torres had a theory

21:14.234 --> 21:16.563
that all those perversions
led back to Gill,

21:16.569 --> 21:19.399
that the killer was trying
to cleanse the world

21:19.405 --> 21:21.105
of any people like him,

21:21.107 --> 21:23.677
and then tell the world
why he was doing it.

21:26.678 --> 21:30.377
He was refining his skill
as he went along.

21:30.381 --> 21:31.781
Was there any hard evidence?

21:31.783 --> 21:33.552
Yeah, in every scene there was.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.681
But that wasn't leading us
to who was doing it.

21:36.688 --> 21:39.418
We were playing catch-up.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.423
Couldn't get a break.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.860
And that was at
the swung murder?

21:43.861 --> 21:47.230
Yes and no.

21:47.231 --> 21:51.171
Police work, it isn't always
about followin' a trail of clues

21:51.172 --> 21:53.328
in a perfect line.

21:53.337 --> 21:57.466
Sometimes you have to

21:57.473 --> 22:00.173
follow the wrong thing

22:00.176 --> 22:02.406
to move in the right direction.

22:02.411 --> 22:04.511
I don't follow.

22:04.514 --> 22:06.914
It confirmed there was a why
to the killings.

22:06.916 --> 22:09.145
And if you have a why,
it allows you

22:09.151 --> 22:11.491
to find out who might be next.

22:20.327 --> 22:22.856
Ah.

22:39.378 --> 22:42.218
So you live here all alone?

22:44.383 --> 22:48.312
We're on our honeymoon.
Just married.

22:52.924 --> 22:56.694
So you're newlyweds, huh?

22:57.628 --> 22:59.528
Yeah, newlyweds.

22:59.531 --> 23:02.290
I know.
Will we last?

23:02.300 --> 23:04.430
You are young.

23:04.435 --> 23:08.575
Age, experience,
not mutually exclusive.

23:10.207 --> 23:13.247
We've seen things.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.813
Bet you seen some things.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.983
You drive that big rig outside?

23:20.984 --> 23:25.521
So I can put food in the pantry.

23:25.522 --> 23:29.621
And thank god.
In times like these.

23:29.625 --> 23:33.595
So what do you do
to support your wife, Jeff?

23:36.231 --> 23:38.931
We support each other.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.969
Jeff's a brilliant artist.

23:41.970 --> 23:43.730
What do you do?

23:43.738 --> 23:47.438
Are you a painter or a sculptor?

23:47.442 --> 23:50.312
Free form-ish.

23:53.547 --> 23:55.676
How long have you two
been together?

23:55.682 --> 23:58.682
Forever.
Right, honey?

23:59.885 --> 24:01.721
We're soulmates.

24:01.722 --> 24:04.362
It was love at first sight.

24:05.658 --> 24:07.957
Everlasting love.

24:27.678 --> 24:30.008
Fuck.

25:20.995 --> 25:23.863
You folks caught me
on a bad, bad day.

25:23.864 --> 25:26.032
I've got a lot of work to do.

25:30.803 --> 25:35.603
Huh.

25:35.608 --> 25:37.948
That's interesting.

25:38.977 --> 25:41.546
No rest for the wicked.

25:47.819 --> 25:50.419
Excuse me.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.029
No tow truck yet?

26:54.447 --> 26:56.547
Instead of just standing there
and gawking at me,

26:56.550 --> 26:58.450
you wanna help me?

27:05.724 --> 27:07.124
Doesn't look
like a man cave to me.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.926
Is that your wife
and your kid in the photo?

27:09.929 --> 27:12.569
- Yeah.
- Where are they?

27:16.534 --> 27:19.634
Do you, uh...

27:19.638 --> 27:22.638
Are you into that, uh...

27:22.641 --> 27:25.601
Into that fairy...
Fairy thing?

27:25.610 --> 27:28.745
I'm flattered, Emery.

27:28.746 --> 27:31.581
I mean, like, fairytale stuff.

27:31.582 --> 27:33.742
Like, a soulmate.

27:33.751 --> 27:36.051
I have beliefs.

27:36.053 --> 27:40.452
I believe in...
Connection.

27:41.824 --> 27:45.524
I believe in destiny.

27:45.528 --> 27:48.630
I believe in justice.

27:48.631 --> 27:50.731
Destiny.

27:50.733 --> 27:52.063
Another belief.

27:52.068 --> 27:54.137
See, everybody
has to have a belief.

27:54.138 --> 27:56.476
Love...

27:58.072 --> 28:00.541
Love is hard work.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.612
Sometimes even that is, uh...

28:04.912 --> 28:06.311
Did you and your wife
get a divorce?

28:12.052 --> 28:13.752
Life's more complicated
than that.

28:13.754 --> 28:16.224
It's not just about paper.

28:17.257 --> 28:20.816
Is your wife snoopy like you?

28:20.827 --> 28:22.857
Worse.

28:31.504 --> 28:33.103
Mm.

28:46.216 --> 28:48.686
Hmm.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.809
Hmm.

29:27.955 --> 29:30.955
Mind if I use your phone?

29:32.826 --> 29:35.126
Sure.

30:33.148 --> 30:35.818
Jeff, can you come here
a second?

30:35.819 --> 30:38.349
What is it, baby?

30:40.956 --> 30:42.886
Jeff, watch out!

30:47.261 --> 30:49.761
So we knew our
guy was killing people

30:49.765 --> 30:51.925
he thought deserved it...
Sexual sinners,

30:51.934 --> 30:54.772
people who offended
his moral righteousness.

30:54.773 --> 30:57.100
So we get a call
from the truck stop.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.805
They found some blood.

30:58.806 --> 31:01.036
Agent Torres believed
that the blood was human blood,

31:01.042 --> 31:02.382
reckoned that it was fresh.

31:02.383 --> 31:05.846
So maybe our guy
abducted somebody.

31:05.847 --> 31:07.647
So we started thinking.

31:07.649 --> 31:10.149
Who hangs out at truck stops?

31:10.151 --> 31:11.685
Lot lizards.

31:11.686 --> 31:13.045
A what?

31:13.053 --> 31:14.913
A "lot lizard."
A hooker.

31:14.921 --> 31:16.691
Hangs out at bars
and truck stops.

31:16.692 --> 31:19.725
Plies her trade
in the back of semi trucks.

31:19.726 --> 31:22.326
So our guy comes across
a lot lizard.

31:22.329 --> 31:24.259
He's offended by that, right?

31:24.264 --> 31:28.293
So he takes her, kills her,
I don't know. Something.

31:28.300 --> 31:32.303
But the point is that he needs
to set up a diorama.

31:32.304 --> 31:35.173
He's got a hooker.
What else does he need?

31:35.174 --> 31:38.374
Trucker who sleeps
with lot lizards.

31:40.110 --> 31:43.150
Do you know how many truck stops
there are in Clay county?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.282
37.

31:45.283 --> 31:48.313
So we start working our way
down the list,

31:48.319 --> 31:50.688
looking for anything
out of the ordinary.

31:50.689 --> 31:53.358
Still a needle in the haystack.

31:54.757 --> 31:57.093
It was a long day.

31:57.094 --> 32:00.994
But the blood was only
a few hours old,

32:00.998 --> 32:05.307
and that was the closest
anybody'd ever been.

32:13.975 --> 32:17.975
- Webber.
- Sheriff.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.379
We want to ask you
a few questions

32:19.381 --> 32:21.781
about your morning clientele.

32:21.783 --> 32:23.453
I wasn't here this morning.

32:23.454 --> 32:29.122
Uncle bones was.

32:29.124 --> 32:30.854
Is he coming back in
later today?

32:30.859 --> 32:33.858
Bones stepped out
for an hour or so.

32:33.861 --> 32:35.328
Why don't you guys go over there

32:35.329 --> 32:36.459
and make yourself comfortable?

32:36.464 --> 32:38.464
He'll be back.

32:38.466 --> 32:40.466
Stay out of trouble, will ya?

32:55.180 --> 32:57.080
What am I gonna do?

32:57.083 --> 33:00.318
Emery, where's my wife?

33:00.319 --> 33:02.989
Okay, just take it easy.
Just calm down.

33:02.990 --> 33:04.758
What did you do
with my wife, Emery?

33:04.759 --> 33:06.317
She's fine.

33:06.325 --> 33:07.855
What did you to her, Emery?

33:07.860 --> 33:10.360
What did you do to my wife?

33:10.362 --> 33:12.399
Now just calm down.
Don't do that.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.166
- What did you do...
- Just take it easy, all right?

33:18.101 --> 33:19.870
She's in the car, all right?

33:19.871 --> 33:21.301
She's in the car.

33:21.305 --> 33:24.775
I just want you
to calm down, okay?

33:35.518 --> 33:38.018
You know, I'm just
tryin' to do a simple thing.

33:40.288 --> 33:42.788
I wanna put a dog on its back.

33:44.526 --> 33:46.956
A dog I love.
You know,

33:46.962 --> 33:49.892
I mean, a good dog.
Not a bad dog.

33:50.899 --> 33:54.868
Bad dog, you just put down.

33:55.803 --> 33:57.933
You know what I mean?

33:57.939 --> 34:00.109
I do understand.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.113
Hey, Emery,

34:07.114 --> 34:09.813
why don't you be a champ

34:09.817 --> 34:11.657
and hand me one of those
malt balls over there?

34:35.606 --> 34:38.005
Hmm.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.539
Mm.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.944
That's good.

34:44.981 --> 34:47.451
That was a kind thing
to do, Emery.

34:50.253 --> 34:52.353
Okay, enough of this.

34:52.356 --> 34:55.625
Emery, I need to see my wife.

34:55.626 --> 34:57.993
I have made a commitment.

34:57.994 --> 34:59.862
Don't you understand?

34:59.863 --> 35:03.398
I've made a commitment
to my wife.

35:03.399 --> 35:05.868
Now, you might not understand
what that word means...

35:05.869 --> 35:08.299
What did you say?

35:08.304 --> 35:11.606
You have the audacity
to come into my house

35:11.607 --> 35:14.937
and put your dirty shoes
on my fuckin' coffee table

35:14.943 --> 35:20.081
and say I don't have
a commitment.

35:20.082 --> 35:22.416
You wanna see my commitment?

35:22.417 --> 35:25.246
I'll show you my commitment.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.593
I'll show you my commitment.

35:50.542 --> 35:52.981
This is my wife Brenda.

35:55.146 --> 35:57.976
She screws around.

35:57.983 --> 36:01.613
She got no feeling
from the waist down.

36:03.421 --> 36:06.390
And she screws around on me.

36:09.159 --> 36:10.699
I got a bitch
in the bathroom back there

36:10.700 --> 36:13.025
that was screwing her.

36:15.299 --> 36:18.034
I saw them.

36:18.035 --> 36:20.605
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna put you

36:20.606 --> 36:23.634
and that wife of yours
in that bathroom with him.

36:48.028 --> 36:50.188
What were you doing
wasting all that time

36:50.198 --> 36:52.258
with this idiot, huh?

36:54.501 --> 36:57.370
Krissy.

36:57.371 --> 36:59.601
Baby?

37:00.540 --> 37:02.570
Ow!

37:02.576 --> 37:05.316
- Did he do anything to you?
- He doubted our love.

37:45.181 --> 37:47.450
It's okay, sweetheart.

37:47.451 --> 37:49.551
Well, I'll be darned.

37:49.553 --> 37:52.287
Our day couldn't get
any weirder.

37:52.288 --> 37:55.388
Gotta say, Emery,
you have thrown me for a loop.

37:55.392 --> 37:58.127
I am thoroughly intrigued.

37:58.128 --> 38:01.228
We've never seen anything like
this before, have we, honey?

38:01.231 --> 38:03.231
In all our time
on this glorious mission.

38:03.233 --> 38:05.692
No, we have not.

38:18.446 --> 38:20.546
I'm starving.

38:23.316 --> 38:26.256
Here's what I wanna know.

38:28.321 --> 38:30.480
How did you two meet?

38:30.490 --> 38:34.090
I was in high school,
and he had a truck.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.261
Thank you.

38:35.262 --> 38:37.422
Have you always
been handicapped?

38:37.431 --> 38:39.491
No. No.

38:39.499 --> 38:41.834
Thank god.

38:41.835 --> 38:44.564
Your legs look fine to me.

38:44.570 --> 38:46.670
I'm paralyzed.

38:46.672 --> 38:49.542
So you can't feel anything?

38:52.377 --> 38:55.517
Mm. What
do we do now?

39:12.628 --> 39:15.698
Oh, my god!

39:15.699 --> 39:18.799
Not even a tickle.

39:27.609 --> 39:29.809
Mm.

39:34.883 --> 39:37.722
Don't like her very much
right now, do you?

39:37.723 --> 39:40.149
Teach her a lesson, baby.

39:42.189 --> 39:44.358
Okay.

39:52.232 --> 39:56.272
Old man, get.

39:58.571 --> 40:00.607
Why?

40:00.608 --> 40:03.537
'Cause I want you to know

40:03.543 --> 40:05.543
how your beautiful wife feels.

40:05.545 --> 40:08.345
That's why.

40:11.184 --> 40:13.744
I wanna check out
the bitch in the bathtub.

40:18.322 --> 40:19.782
Nice.

40:26.497 --> 40:28.797
I'm gonna go hang
with the cripple.

40:32.469 --> 40:34.869
Did you know this man?

40:37.807 --> 40:39.777
Tell me how it went down.

40:41.678 --> 40:42.877
It was early in the morning.

40:44.748 --> 40:48.484
I was supposed to haul a load
of plastics to Chicago...

40:50.554 --> 40:51.814
But my boss
dropped the contract,

40:51.821 --> 40:54.451
so I was free to go home.

40:54.457 --> 40:55.791
Surprise the wife.

41:10.505 --> 41:12.505
Oh, my god!

41:15.275 --> 41:16.875
What have you done?

41:16.878 --> 41:17.938
Oh, god.

41:17.946 --> 41:20.946
Oh, my god.

41:20.949 --> 41:23.678
Why are you even here?

41:23.684 --> 41:25.884
Oh, my god.

42:45.392 --> 42:47.622
You were our fuckin' therapist.

42:47.628 --> 42:49.663
You sick fuck.

42:49.664 --> 42:53.064
Your therapist?

42:53.067 --> 42:56.535
Well, not so bad.
It was all just an accident.

42:56.536 --> 42:58.506
If you explain it to the guy,
he's a doctor.

42:58.507 --> 43:00.474
He's used to dealing
with crazy people.

43:00.475 --> 43:01.933
I'm sure he'll get over it.

43:01.941 --> 43:06.441
Hey, bitch, it's all
just a misunderstanding.

43:06.446 --> 43:08.576
Why don't you let bygones
be bygones, you know?

43:08.581 --> 43:11.840
You and Emery.
Hug it out.

43:11.850 --> 43:16.350
Excuse me?
What was that, gory man?

43:16.355 --> 43:19.691
What an asshole.

43:19.692 --> 43:22.521
But he is dead.

43:22.527 --> 43:24.861
Tsst-tsst-tsst.

43:24.862 --> 43:26.630
The blood sprayed out,

43:26.631 --> 43:28.391
white pillowcases
over their heads

43:28.399 --> 43:30.729
to cover their filthy faces.

43:30.735 --> 43:32.669
And then we marked them

43:32.670 --> 43:35.838
so people wouldn't be confused
as to why we offed them.

43:35.839 --> 43:40.339
There's a passage in the Bible
that sums it up pretty well.

43:40.344 --> 43:42.982
It's better to hang
a millstone around your neck

43:42.983 --> 43:44.609
and be cast into the ocean

43:44.614 --> 43:47.350
than to offend
one of these little ones.

43:47.351 --> 43:51.419
You do degrading,
deviant sexual things

43:51.420 --> 43:54.620
to people who are just
begging to be loved...

43:54.623 --> 43:56.558
Little kids,

43:56.559 --> 43:59.027
you deserve to fucking die.

43:59.028 --> 44:01.488
Yes.
Yes, i... I hear you.

44:01.497 --> 44:02.996
You're right. I...

44:02.997 --> 44:04.797
Krissy, I can see that
you've had a really hard life,

44:04.799 --> 44:06.599
and you need help,
and if you let me,

44:06.601 --> 44:07.868
I can help you.

44:07.869 --> 44:10.569
Help? You wanna...
You wanna help me?

44:10.572 --> 44:15.541
No. You're the one that's gonna
need help today, Brenda.

44:15.542 --> 44:17.942
Oh, man.
Now I gotta piss.

44:19.579 --> 44:21.009
Thing is, my friend,

44:21.014 --> 44:24.944
I don't think
this was an accident.

44:24.952 --> 44:27.692
I think you killed this man
because you wanted to.

44:27.693 --> 44:29.617
Because you needed to.

44:29.622 --> 44:31.062
Because you enjoyed
the act of it.

44:31.063 --> 44:33.825
Because you were
flexing your power.

44:33.826 --> 44:35.894
Yeah?

44:35.895 --> 44:36.925
So which one is it?

44:36.929 --> 44:40.065
A, b, c, or d?

44:40.066 --> 44:42.065
All the above?

44:44.068 --> 44:46.137
I can see
that you are a good girl.

44:46.138 --> 44:48.108
I see it.
You remind me of me

44:48.109 --> 44:49.706
when I was your age.

44:49.708 --> 44:50.908
Please, don't let
a deranged man ruin...

44:50.909 --> 44:53.177
Don't you even understand?

44:53.178 --> 44:55.717
Or do you just buy right into
this whole idea

44:55.718 --> 45:00.143
of what's right
and what's wrong?

45:03.087 --> 45:04.756
First point, you are a whore.

45:04.757 --> 45:07.125
Second point,
you say you love your husband,

45:07.126 --> 45:09.191
which makes you a liar.

45:09.192 --> 45:12.592
Mm. What's this?

45:12.595 --> 45:15.864
Another couple killed
off the interstate.

45:15.865 --> 45:17.933
Was it you?

45:17.934 --> 45:19.864
Or was it...?

45:25.039 --> 45:26.899
Ah.

45:29.977 --> 45:33.447
You don't look the part, Jeff.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.852
What the fuck's
this country coming to?

45:38.853 --> 45:42.022
I know, right?

45:42.023 --> 45:43.523
And yet you
think that I'm the one

45:43.524 --> 45:45.994
that needs help.

45:47.127 --> 45:50.563
"Help" is a dirty, ugly word.

45:50.564 --> 45:54.033
I remind you of yourself?

45:54.034 --> 45:56.834
Jeff loves me.

45:56.837 --> 46:01.796
He heals me with his love.

46:01.807 --> 46:04.907
God, it must be so easy for you.

46:04.910 --> 46:09.510
In this society
where adultery is tolerated.

46:09.515 --> 46:11.785
Where... where drug dealers
and pimps

46:11.786 --> 46:16.053
and... and whores
are celebrated by the media.

46:16.054 --> 46:18.864
At least we're doing
something about it.

46:23.061 --> 46:24.728
You ladies having fun?

46:24.729 --> 46:27.798
Not really.
Brenda's boring me.

46:27.799 --> 46:31.798
She doesn't have a clue.
She's just a whore.

46:35.271 --> 46:37.611
Oh, Brenda.

46:39.542 --> 46:41.910
Brenda, Brenda, Brenda.

46:41.911 --> 46:43.981
Emery just showed me the remains

46:43.982 --> 46:47.780
of your chopped-up lover
in the bathtub.

46:47.783 --> 46:49.943
How's that make you feel?

46:49.952 --> 46:52.122
God, please, just...

46:56.123 --> 46:59.123
You two like art?

46:59.127 --> 47:00.757
You wanna be art?

47:03.197 --> 47:05.533
Nobody cares about you.

47:05.534 --> 47:07.734
Whole fuckin' world
doesn't give a fuck

47:07.736 --> 47:10.865
about two demented people,

47:10.871 --> 47:13.801
just running around
doin' all kinds of shit

47:13.807 --> 47:17.207
and killin' people,
and... fuck.

47:17.211 --> 47:19.911
Shut the fuck up!

47:19.914 --> 47:22.073
You can't even
keep your wife satisfied.

47:22.081 --> 47:23.811
You push her to cheat on you.

47:23.816 --> 47:26.885
That does not excuse you.

47:26.886 --> 47:28.616
I say we kill her.

47:28.621 --> 47:32.021
We kill her first
and we mark her down as "slut."

47:32.025 --> 47:34.295
And Emery...

47:36.227 --> 47:38.327
Mark him down
as "cuckold."

47:38.330 --> 47:41.630
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

47:41.633 --> 47:44.033
I wanna hear
the whole story first.

47:47.737 --> 47:49.277
Talk to me, Brenda.

47:49.278 --> 47:53.643
When did Emery
stop having sex with you?

47:53.644 --> 47:54.874
After the accident.

47:54.879 --> 47:56.939
Brenda.

47:56.948 --> 47:59.208
Emery must have been a leg man.

48:01.617 --> 48:03.277
You watch a lot of porn, Emery?

48:03.286 --> 48:05.854
No.

48:05.855 --> 48:07.690
That's a lie.

48:07.691 --> 48:10.759
Hmm. Another juicy piece
of information.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.860
I wanna hear about the kid.

48:12.862 --> 48:14.931
No.

48:16.130 --> 48:19.767
I don't want you
to talk about my son.

48:19.768 --> 48:21.998
Kurt.

48:22.004 --> 48:24.042
You never wanna talk about him.

48:24.043 --> 48:26.269
You just wanna pretend
he never happened.

48:26.275 --> 48:28.984
Just let it out, Brenda.
Talk about it.

48:34.281 --> 48:37.017
It was just really bad luck.

48:37.018 --> 48:40.287
- No.
- What happened?

48:40.288 --> 48:42.617
We were driving
to football practice

48:42.623 --> 48:46.093
on a Saturday morning,
and a drunk driver hit us.

48:47.226 --> 48:50.126
He was just 13.

48:50.130 --> 48:52.970
Emery wasn't here.
Emery was out on the road.

48:52.971 --> 48:54.965
I was on the road.

49:00.338 --> 49:01.968
Okay, okay, and then he dies.

49:01.974 --> 49:03.834
Ah.

49:03.843 --> 49:06.173
So what?
Then he stopped touching her?

49:06.178 --> 49:08.777
If you had made any effort
at our marriage counseling,

49:08.780 --> 49:10.650
we could have had
a shot at this.

49:10.651 --> 49:14.318
Oh, and maybe...
Maybe he would fuck me too.

49:14.319 --> 49:15.953
Fuck you.

49:15.954 --> 49:17.284
All right, that's enough.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.126
Why don't you
just fucking kill me?

49:19.127 --> 49:20.723
Krissy, tape this fool up.

49:20.724 --> 49:22.692
Finally.

49:22.693 --> 49:24.823
Show them what
they've been missing.

49:30.233 --> 49:33.902
But there are very few
Hannibal Lecters in real life,

49:33.903 --> 49:36.073
so when a case
as sensational as this

49:36.074 --> 49:37.732
hits the airwaves,

49:37.740 --> 49:39.400
every crime unit
across the country

49:39.409 --> 49:41.076
sends in their unsolved.

49:41.077 --> 49:43.945
Half the time,
we're just weeding through.

49:43.946 --> 49:46.046
It's a frustrating process

49:46.049 --> 49:48.388
dealing with media,
local law enforcement,

49:48.389 --> 49:51.383
and their ridiculous theories.
No offense.

49:51.386 --> 49:53.924
But there are specifics
you begin to spot.

49:53.925 --> 49:55.282
Without seeing a face,

49:55.290 --> 49:56.990
you get to know
your killer personally.

49:56.992 --> 50:00.361
- Like a lover.
- Yeah.

50:00.362 --> 50:03.761
I guess you could draw
that comparison.

50:03.764 --> 50:06.864
You see, I reckon
that this guy and this guy

50:06.867 --> 50:08.334
are one and the same.

50:08.335 --> 50:10.273
There's a consistency
in the weapon used.

50:10.274 --> 50:11.701
The deep puncture to the neck.

50:11.706 --> 50:15.441
Same murder technique.
Same weapon.

50:15.442 --> 50:18.172
Yeah, but what confuses me
about the truck stop

50:18.178 --> 50:20.078
is that the spray is wider,

50:20.080 --> 50:24.249
possibly created
by a different weapon.

50:24.250 --> 50:28.879
Couple slain by diorama killer.

50:28.887 --> 50:30.947
And we still don't know for sure

50:30.956 --> 50:32.046
if it's the same guy,

50:32.057 --> 50:33.357
'cause a perp doesn't usually

50:33.358 --> 50:34.858
change his pattern so radically.

50:34.860 --> 50:36.930
Not unless he's afraid
of being caught.

50:36.931 --> 50:40.398
But from disorder
to this kinda structured thing?

50:47.971 --> 50:49.971
Maybe he fell in love.

50:49.974 --> 50:51.474
With another killer,

50:51.476 --> 50:54.235
explaining the female DNA
at all the murder sites.

50:54.244 --> 50:58.204
Love forms that miracle
every day.

51:03.819 --> 51:05.788
You all lookin' for me?

51:05.789 --> 51:07.018
Bones?

51:07.022 --> 51:09.257
That's what they call me.

51:09.258 --> 51:10.958
We've got this
suspected homicide

51:10.960 --> 51:12.460
down by the truck stop.

51:12.461 --> 51:14.861
Actually, we have maybe
more than one homicide.

51:14.864 --> 51:17.394
Sir, were there any truckers
in here this morning?

51:17.399 --> 51:20.467
Honey, there's truckers
in here every morning.

51:20.468 --> 51:22.908
Yeah, but anybody
out of the ordinary?

51:22.909 --> 51:26.834
Well...

51:26.841 --> 51:30.144
There was one.

51:30.145 --> 51:32.005
Hank Zimms.

51:37.784 --> 51:41.114
What's so special
about Hank Zimms?

51:42.421 --> 51:45.151
Sheriff?

51:45.159 --> 51:47.458
What's so special about Hank?

51:48.827 --> 51:50.927
He was the perfect victim.

51:50.930 --> 51:54.030
He was a degenerate, a lowlife.

51:54.033 --> 51:55.433
It didn't get worse than Hank.

51:55.434 --> 51:58.334
He'd been arrested for drugs,
petty crime,

51:58.337 --> 52:01.305
slept with hookers.

52:01.306 --> 52:04.206
But...
He was also

52:04.209 --> 52:06.209
the worst tow truck driver

52:06.211 --> 52:07.941
in Clay county.

52:07.946 --> 52:10.281
So find Hank and...

52:10.282 --> 52:12.852
We might be onto something.

52:33.535 --> 52:35.845
Cool.

52:38.473 --> 52:41.172
You guys gave your kids toys.

52:41.176 --> 52:42.506
Huh.

52:42.511 --> 52:46.011
Good parents
give their kids toys.

52:53.887 --> 52:56.587
I know you won't
believe me, but...

52:59.526 --> 53:02.056
I don't look at porn.

53:03.463 --> 53:06.203
It was Kurt's.

53:07.333 --> 53:10.302
I didn't want you to find it.

53:10.303 --> 53:12.543
Why didn't you just
throw it out?

53:17.142 --> 53:19.611
They were my son's.

53:53.309 --> 53:55.509
♪ I...

53:57.947 --> 54:00.016
♪ Reside

54:02.350 --> 54:06.950

54:06.956 --> 54:08.986

55:03.175 --> 55:06.409
Huh? Huh?

55:06.410 --> 55:07.510
Here, fucking shoot him.

55:07.511 --> 55:10.311
No. No, go get Brenda.

55:20.422 --> 55:22.492
Brenda...?

55:30.466 --> 55:33.065
Hmm.

55:33.068 --> 55:37.138
You gonna come in nicely?

55:51.551 --> 55:52.691
Got her!

56:11.671 --> 56:14.270
- Who's that?
- Help! Help us!

56:14.273 --> 56:16.203
Keep yelling, and I'll kill
whoever's out there.

56:16.208 --> 56:17.778
It's my buddy.
He's a cop.

56:17.779 --> 56:19.544
He comes by to visit.

56:19.545 --> 56:22.714
If you let us go,
you get out the back door,

56:22.715 --> 56:27.384
you can get away in the woods.

56:27.385 --> 56:30.185
Answer it.

56:52.741 --> 56:54.609
Tonya?

56:55.845 --> 56:59.748
Dad, I told you to shut up!

56:59.749 --> 57:01.349
You looking for Hank?

57:01.350 --> 57:03.180
He's been out
with the tow truck all mornin'.

57:07.688 --> 57:11.388
God bless America.

57:11.393 --> 57:13.363
Who are you?

57:14.728 --> 57:18.757
I'm, uh, Hank Zimms.

57:20.834 --> 57:24.237
Hanky-panky towing.
Emery called.

57:24.238 --> 57:25.638
Is everything all right in here?

57:25.639 --> 57:27.169
I heard some yellin'.

57:27.174 --> 57:28.814
Yeah, no, everything's fine.

57:28.815 --> 57:33.278
Um, I was just...

57:33.279 --> 57:37.179
I'm a massage
and physical therapist.

57:37.183 --> 57:39.118
Nudastic massage.

57:39.119 --> 57:43.319
I, um, I help Brenda
with her condition

57:43.323 --> 57:44.790
and Emery too.

57:44.791 --> 57:47.760
Um, yeah, it was actually
my car that broke down,

57:47.761 --> 57:50.795
so I'm just gonna
go put my shoes on

57:50.796 --> 57:53.196
and I'll be right back, okay?

57:53.198 --> 57:56.834
- Sure.
- Okay.

57:56.835 --> 57:58.464
You looking for Hank,

57:58.469 --> 58:00.339
he been out all morning
with the tow truck.

58:00.340 --> 58:02.668
Call all the way out
on I-84.

58:02.673 --> 58:03.833
So he's working?

58:03.841 --> 58:06.776
I told you, Emery called Hank

58:06.777 --> 58:08.607
and asked him
to bring out the tow truck,

58:08.613 --> 58:10.213
so that's where Hank be heading.

58:10.214 --> 58:11.873
So can we get
his address please?

58:11.882 --> 58:14.312
I don't know it.

58:14.317 --> 58:15.547
You got a warrant?

58:15.552 --> 58:17.482
Tonya, he's not in any trouble.

58:17.487 --> 58:19.157
We just need to talk to him.

58:19.158 --> 58:22.856
I don't know if I want her
talking to Hank, Ricky.

58:22.859 --> 58:25.627
Unless maybe
we're doing a man swap.

58:25.628 --> 58:27.668
You can have my pig of a husband

58:27.669 --> 58:30.693
and I'll tuck in
with Ricky here.

58:30.699 --> 58:33.368
- Look, ma'am...
- Tonya...

58:33.369 --> 58:35.509
I'd consider it a personal favor

58:35.510 --> 58:38.373
if you'd get the address for us.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.810
Who is it?

58:46.814 --> 58:48.944
The tow truck.

58:48.950 --> 58:52.479
You really call the tow truck?

58:53.419 --> 58:55.719
I'll be damned, Emery.

58:55.722 --> 58:57.822
All right,
you need to go with him,

58:57.824 --> 59:00.493
get our tire changed,
come right back.

59:00.494 --> 59:02.264
Why do I have to go with him?

59:02.265 --> 59:05.261
Because I said so.

59:05.264 --> 59:08.333
You're treating me like an
annoying little kid right now.

59:08.334 --> 59:09.734
And?

59:09.735 --> 59:12.504
And will you just admit
that you're being bossy?

59:12.505 --> 59:14.372
Yeah, I'll admit that.

59:14.373 --> 59:16.373
But you still need
to go get our tire changed

59:16.375 --> 59:17.813
and bring the car back.

59:17.814 --> 59:19.539
Don't let him
get suspicious either.

59:19.544 --> 59:21.679
Fine.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.380
I'm gonna go with him
and get the car

59:23.381 --> 59:25.811
because that's what I wanna do.

59:25.817 --> 59:28.717
Okay.

01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:12.830
What do we do?

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:16.967
We don't.

01:00:22.669 --> 01:00:24.937
Thank you.

01:00:24.938 --> 01:00:27.973
For what?

01:00:27.974 --> 01:00:30.304
For trying to save my life.

01:00:36.749 --> 01:00:38.816
So you got a caddy?

01:00:38.817 --> 01:00:40.785
Yep.

01:00:40.786 --> 01:00:43.386
I got a hemi in here.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:47.425
I can hook it up to just about
anything and make it move.

01:00:47.426 --> 01:00:50.695
It's a big hemi.

01:00:50.696 --> 01:00:53.664
So what you're saying is

01:00:53.665 --> 01:00:56.633
it's the size
of the hemi that matters?

01:00:56.634 --> 01:01:00.574
Uh, yeah, I guess I am.

01:01:02.072 --> 01:01:06.741
But isn't it really
more about how you use it?

01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:09.879
I mean, I don't really know

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.910
how... how it works.

01:01:12.916 --> 01:01:15.386
Most boys don't.

01:01:19.854 --> 01:01:22.424
Well, thank you.

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:39.738
Thank you for
the tow truck, Emery.

01:01:42.577 --> 01:01:44.776
He's a real catch.

01:01:44.778 --> 01:01:47.578
He deserves a reward.

01:01:47.581 --> 01:01:51.117
Something like...
A faithful wife.

01:01:51.118 --> 01:01:52.978
Shame on you.

01:01:52.986 --> 01:01:55.616
You will never go hungry
with this man.

01:02:04.062 --> 01:02:06.631
Emery's address.

01:02:06.632 --> 01:02:09.668
I found it just for you.

01:02:09.669 --> 01:02:11.368
If you throw him in jail,

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:12.937
don't call to tell me.

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.968
You just come 'round here
in person.

01:02:36.726 --> 01:02:40.595
Ugh. This tire's
getting me all grimy.

01:02:40.597 --> 01:02:42.897
Let me get it.

01:02:42.899 --> 01:02:46.468
You know, I don't mind
gettin' a little dirty,

01:02:46.469 --> 01:02:48.804
if you know what I mean.

01:02:48.805 --> 01:02:51.472
So, um, that's the Jack,

01:02:51.473 --> 01:02:54.003
and then, uh, what's
that other thing do again?

01:02:54.009 --> 01:02:56.844
The Jack is for gettin' it up.

01:02:59.081 --> 01:03:02.641
And the wrench
is for playing with nuts.

01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:04.950
Now, you seem kinda like
a hands-on girl.

01:03:04.952 --> 01:03:07.882
Right now...

01:03:07.889 --> 01:03:12.419
I don't think your wife
would really like hearing that.

01:03:12.427 --> 01:03:14.194
My wife is a cow.

01:03:14.195 --> 01:03:16.994
And she knows I'm a pig.

01:03:16.997 --> 01:03:19.799
You're as hot a goat
in a pepper patch.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.830
You sure know
how to talk to a lady.

01:03:23.904 --> 01:03:26.672
Um, i... oops.

01:03:26.673 --> 01:03:28.773
My hands are all dirty.

01:03:28.775 --> 01:03:31.774
Uh, you know, I have
some baby wipes in the car.

01:03:31.777 --> 01:03:33.907
Would you mind
getting them for me, please?

01:03:33.913 --> 01:03:35.582
I don't mind a little dirt.

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:38.511
Oh, yeah, but I wanna
be clean just for you.

01:03:38.517 --> 01:03:40.547
Please?
Pretty please?

01:03:40.553 --> 01:03:43.821
That's sweet.
I like that.

01:03:43.822 --> 01:03:48.222
That is sweet.

01:03:48.226 --> 01:03:50.656
In the front?
Where are they?

01:03:50.662 --> 01:03:53.092
Oh, they're, uh,
they're in there.

01:03:53.097 --> 01:03:54.727
I don't see 'em.

01:03:54.732 --> 01:03:56.831
Oh, well, they're...
They're just a little bit

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.601
deeper in the front there.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:00.502
Are they under the seat?

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:03.573
Are they in
the glove compartment, maybe?

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:06.544
No.

01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:24.892
Did you let your
marriage counselor kiss you?

01:04:24.893 --> 01:04:29.093
No.

01:04:29.097 --> 01:04:31.727
Did you let him
put it in your mouth?

01:04:31.733 --> 01:04:33.763
No.

01:04:33.768 --> 01:04:35.598
Leave her alone.

01:04:35.604 --> 01:04:38.133
That all you got, Emery?

01:04:49.048 --> 01:04:51.647
You feel that?

01:04:52.918 --> 01:04:55.554
What about that?

01:04:55.555 --> 01:05:00.025
How do you want it, baby?

01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:04.868
Looks like I found
the only place

01:05:04.869 --> 01:05:06.931
open for business.

01:05:06.932 --> 01:05:08.232
Leave her the fuck alone.

01:05:08.233 --> 01:05:10.563
It appears
that all your wife needed

01:05:10.569 --> 01:05:12.136
was a good banging.

01:05:12.137 --> 01:05:15.037
Leave her the fuck alone, Jeff!

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.669
I'll fuckin' kill you!

01:05:19.844 --> 01:05:21.611
I love you, Emery.

01:05:21.612 --> 01:05:23.612
How do you feel about this,
Emery, huh?

01:05:23.614 --> 01:05:27.254
I'm sorry.

01:05:50.972 --> 01:05:53.872
Honey.

01:05:53.876 --> 01:05:54.943
I'm home.

01:05:54.944 --> 01:05:57.083
Hey, baby.

01:05:58.011 --> 01:06:01.681
Look.

01:06:01.683 --> 01:06:04.153
What? What is it?

01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:07.916
What did you do?

01:06:10.056 --> 01:06:12.016
Tell me there's still blood
left in the hooker

01:06:12.025 --> 01:06:13.755
and he didn't notice.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.829
He didn't notice.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:20.330
But I may have kind of...

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:23.303
Just a little bit killed him.

01:06:26.204 --> 01:06:31.134
You are so impulsive.

01:06:31.143 --> 01:06:32.911
If you don't watch it,
you're gonna get us caught.

01:06:32.912 --> 01:06:35.012
It's not like I left him
lying in the middle of the road.

01:06:35.014 --> 01:06:36.343
I put him in the car.

01:06:36.348 --> 01:06:37.978
And the truck?
What about the truck?

01:06:37.983 --> 01:06:39.213
What about the truck?
No one'll notice.

01:06:39.217 --> 01:06:41.347
They'll think
it just broke down.

01:06:54.397 --> 01:06:56.227
What a lot of people
don't know about Chuck Norris

01:06:56.233 --> 01:06:58.933
is that he was actually
trained by Bruce Lee.

01:06:58.936 --> 01:07:00.736
He hangs out with, like,

01:07:00.738 --> 01:07:02.767
Buddhists and all sorts
of different people like that.

01:07:02.772 --> 01:07:05.672
He's a lot deeper than people
give him credit for.

01:07:05.675 --> 01:07:10.375
Uh-huh. Huh.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.680
If Zimms is
anything like his wife,

01:07:12.682 --> 01:07:15.742
I kinda doubt
he's gonna be much help.

01:07:17.418 --> 01:07:21.388
Hank is definitely not
the sharpest tool in the shed.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.690
I feel like I been sucked

01:07:27.696 --> 01:07:31.235
into the land of deliverance.

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:38.705
Krissy. Krissy, stop.
I'm not chasing you.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.007
What the hell?

01:07:43.009 --> 01:07:44.969
You drove on the flat?
Wait...

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:46.838
We can't afford to be reckless.

01:07:46.846 --> 01:07:49.116
There's no point
to your violence right now.

01:07:49.117 --> 01:07:51.215
We're not mass murderers.

01:07:51.217 --> 01:07:53.217
- Where are you going?
- Where are we going?

01:07:53.219 --> 01:07:55.748
Nowhere until I fix that tire.

01:07:57.689 --> 01:07:59.819
Why don't we just take
one of the other cars, Jeff?

01:08:02.096 --> 01:08:03.124
Think!

01:08:03.128 --> 01:08:04.758
Sometimes I feel
like you're just

01:08:04.763 --> 01:08:06.463
doing things to get attention.

01:08:06.465 --> 01:08:08.733
Because I'm drawing
all sorts of attention to us

01:08:08.734 --> 01:08:10.303
coming here in the middle
of frickin' nowhere,

01:08:10.304 --> 01:08:13.031
la, la, la, la, la.

01:08:13.037 --> 01:08:14.737
If someone finds out
about that tow truck...

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:19.069
Babe, he was married
and vile and perverse,

01:08:19.077 --> 01:08:20.307
and he hit on me.

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:22.478
I thought you'd be proud of me.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:24.709
He hit on you?

01:08:24.715 --> 01:08:30.145
And he was into
some real sick shit too.

01:08:30.153 --> 01:08:35.292
Pigs and goats
and bestiality bullshit.

01:08:37.892 --> 01:08:39.892
All right.

01:08:39.895 --> 01:08:42.755
I need you to trust me.

01:08:42.765 --> 01:08:46.024
I do.

01:08:46.035 --> 01:08:50.464
I just... I wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

01:09:00.881 --> 01:09:03.249
How's Krissy?

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.290
I told you earlier,
she's physically healthy.

01:09:07.453 --> 01:09:09.513
She quotes a lot of scripture.

01:09:11.424 --> 01:09:13.953
I doubt she learned
much else in the cult.

01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:18.220
Do you really think
she killed all those people?

01:09:18.231 --> 01:09:20.020
She's a pretty little thing

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:22.292
and I guess she's manipulative,

01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:25.361
but some of those guys
were big men.

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:28.501
She didn't even have
a bruise on her.

01:09:28.508 --> 01:09:32.542
She confessed, didn't she?

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:35.174
There's a lot of detail
about certain killings

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.310
and not others.

01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:38.082
She goes on for four pages

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:40.551
about how and why
she killed Hank.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:44.051
Her statement about Gill
is full of anger and rage.

01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:47.189
It's self-righteous.

01:09:47.191 --> 01:09:50.020
But she mentions
Stewart only once.

01:09:50.027 --> 01:09:52.027
He was beaten to death.

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:53.788
It wasn't with a knife.

01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:57.099
Seems more likely
that Jeff killed him.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.800
But why would she confess
to something he did?

01:10:02.938 --> 01:10:04.968
Did you talk to Emery or Brenda?

01:10:04.974 --> 01:10:07.843
They do not wanna talk.

01:10:07.844 --> 01:10:10.813
- I bet they don't.
- What does that mean?

01:10:15.917 --> 01:10:18.877
I was telling you about Hank.

01:10:18.887 --> 01:10:20.447
We were on our way to Emery's

01:10:20.455 --> 01:10:22.594
and we came across
Hank's tow truck,

01:10:22.595 --> 01:10:24.220
but no Hank.

01:10:24.225 --> 01:10:26.393
Come on.

01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:29.563
What do you think
Emery and Brenda are hiding?

01:10:29.564 --> 01:10:32.132
Better question is...

01:10:32.133 --> 01:10:34.573
Why did Emery and Brenda
survive?

01:10:39.538 --> 01:10:41.207
I'll check out the car.

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:43.838
Now you take care of Emery.

01:10:49.881 --> 01:10:53.281
Krissy, you sick bitch.
I'm gonna kill you!

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.620
No.

01:11:03.227 --> 01:11:08.165
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:11.596
Oh. Oh, fuck.

01:11:11.603 --> 01:11:14.103
Oh, Jesus.

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:19.032
Emery! Emery! Emery!

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.983
So how are we gonna do this?

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:35.924
I stuck him in the leg.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.155
We're not.

01:11:38.526 --> 01:11:41.066
What?

01:11:41.996 --> 01:11:43.931
Why?

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.062
'Cause I think they can make it.

01:11:47.234 --> 01:11:50.604
So you're giving them
a second chance?

01:11:51.972 --> 01:11:53.432
They were in love
the whole time.

01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:05.914
Oh, fuck.

01:12:09.087 --> 01:12:12.057
Oh, Jesus.

01:12:21.265 --> 01:12:23.501
Oh, god.

01:12:25.604 --> 01:12:29.044
Ah, shit.

01:12:47.424 --> 01:12:49.458
Look at this beauty.

01:12:49.459 --> 01:12:52.559
Look at this perfection.

01:12:54.497 --> 01:12:56.627
Sappy man.

01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:59.433
Human beings
can be this perfect.

01:12:59.436 --> 01:13:01.135
This harmonious.

01:13:01.136 --> 01:13:03.236
We just keep fucking up.

01:13:06.574 --> 01:13:10.134
If I could only create balance.

01:13:10.145 --> 01:13:13.645
Little understanding
of how easy it is to...

01:13:17.484 --> 01:13:19.544
Lose it all.

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:33.740
When I was a
child, I never felt safe.

01:13:38.437 --> 01:13:41.636
Never felt safe my whole life.

01:13:50.582 --> 01:13:53.612
Today I saw a love story.

01:13:53.619 --> 01:13:58.258
Imperfect, sure, but...
An honest love story.

01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:09.229
All this fear
we grow up with, Krissy,

01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:12.163
the fear you felt in the group,

01:14:14.704 --> 01:14:17.544
the fear Brenda and Emery
felt of us.

01:14:19.742 --> 01:14:22.441
I don't wanna fear.

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:50.398
All this fighting,
and nobody cares.

01:15:03.449 --> 01:15:05.849
Do you know the difference
between right and wrong?

01:15:20.264 --> 01:15:22.594
- Gun.
- FBI, drop your weapon.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.271
Sheriff's department.
Drop your weapon.

01:15:26.637 --> 01:15:29.166
Get on the ground, ma'am!
Get on the ground!

01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:36.845
Thank god you're here.

01:15:42.852 --> 01:15:45.482
Drop your weapon, sir!

01:15:45.489 --> 01:15:47.589
You don't wanna hurt me.

01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:52.194
- You're my brother.
- Don't move, sir.

01:15:52.195 --> 01:15:54.564
And our intentions match.

01:15:57.866 --> 01:15:59.796
You're officers of peace, right?

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:01.362
Agent...?

01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:04.510
I'm a citizen who wants peace.

01:16:06.174 --> 01:16:08.503
Why wound someone
with good intentions?

01:16:14.248 --> 01:16:16.388
Ma'am, put your hands
in the air!

01:16:34.266 --> 01:16:35.766
They call this "artwork."

01:16:35.768 --> 01:16:37.828
Drop your weapon.

01:16:39.504 --> 01:16:41.873
Okay, brother.

01:16:41.874 --> 01:16:44.414
I'm gonna drop my gun.

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.490
Agh!

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:12.397
To be a police officer,

01:17:12.403 --> 01:17:16.202
you have to know the difference
between right and wrong.

01:17:16.206 --> 01:17:18.536
I believe that...

01:17:18.541 --> 01:17:21.541
People who commit crimes

01:17:21.544 --> 01:17:23.714
should be punished for 'em.

01:17:26.948 --> 01:17:29.778
The diorama killer
was a bad guy, right?

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:41.231
He killed over ten people
we know of.

01:17:42.462 --> 01:17:45.332
But he let Brenda
and Emery survive.

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.933
Maybe you killed him
before he had a chance.

01:17:47.935 --> 01:17:50.935
He did beat and torture them.

01:17:52.405 --> 01:17:55.534
The righteous kill.

01:17:55.542 --> 01:17:58.002
They gave me
a medal of valor for that.

01:17:58.011 --> 01:18:00.879
People think you're a hero.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.717
Do you regret taking the shot?

01:18:04.718 --> 01:18:08.253
What if Jeff and Krissy
didn't kill the therapist?

01:18:08.254 --> 01:18:10.654
Then who did?

01:18:10.656 --> 01:18:14.756
Emery was the only other
person there.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.428
Emery?

01:18:17.429 --> 01:18:19.628
Why would Emery kill Stewart?

01:18:19.631 --> 01:18:22.891
And why would Krissy
confess to it?

01:18:24.301 --> 01:18:26.531
Do you believe
in second chances?

01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:30.701
What kind of person
deserves a second chance?

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:33.447
A good guy?
A stand-up guy?

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:38.481
A guy who's suffered,
who's made mistakes?

01:18:38.482 --> 01:18:40.652
Bad, bad mistakes.

01:18:41.651 --> 01:18:44.781
And who loves his wife.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.488
Maybe.

01:18:50.825 --> 01:18:53.025
And what about the serial killer

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:55.559
who gave him that second chance?

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:02.933
Blessed is she,
the daughter of peace

01:19:02.937 --> 01:19:05.967
that hath found a place
within his kingdom.

01:19:06.907 --> 01:19:09.067
My tears are all flowed.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.077
I cannot cry more
for these things,

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.608
for these things.

01:19:15.581 --> 01:19:19.951
We're forever.

01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:22.953
I have to go to sleep now, baby.

01:19:58.121 --> 01:20:02.491
How guilty are a
couple of screwed-up kids?

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:05.992
A couple of kids who've seen
the worst abuse you can see?

01:20:05.995 --> 01:20:08.564
A couple of kids
who have killed,

01:20:08.565 --> 01:20:12.095
who've murdered,
who've tortured...

01:20:14.136 --> 01:20:16.505
But who believed in love enough

01:20:16.506 --> 01:20:19.935
to take the blame
for another man's sins?

01:20:19.942 --> 01:20:23.072
Was there any
evidence to confirm that?

01:20:37.457 --> 01:20:40.427
Brenda and Emery survived.

01:20:40.428 --> 01:20:43.968
Survived as people,
survived as a couple.

01:20:45.965 --> 01:20:48.401
- But...
- There's your ending.

01:20:48.402 --> 01:20:51.670
That rebirth came at a price.

01:20:51.671 --> 01:20:55.741
Everyone involved
paid for their survival,

01:20:55.742 --> 01:20:58.542
paid for their renewal.

01:20:58.545 --> 01:21:01.780
Even me.

01:21:01.781 --> 01:21:04.111
Maybe it was worth it.

01:21:06.418 --> 01:21:08.448
You should end it that way.

01:21:08.454 --> 01:21:11.054
Focus on the survivors.

01:21:11.056 --> 01:21:13.125
A happy ending.

01:21:17.861 --> 01:21:20.561
