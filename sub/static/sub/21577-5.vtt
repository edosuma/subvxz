WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.719
Miche, how you
getting on, babe?

00:02.760 --> 00:04.240
OK, we're ready.

00:08.119 --> 00:11.120
Oh, babe, look at you!

00:11.160 --> 00:13.360
Oh, you look like a princess.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.840
What like a proper one or a shit
boring one, like Kate Middleton?

00:15.880 --> 00:18.360
No, you look like a natural one.
I mean, like a Disney one.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.400
-Doesn't she?
-Yeah, you look lovely.
Beautiful.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.440
-[director] So the marriage
is back on then?
-Yeah.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.800
So I've still got my wedding
plan, so we're good to go.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.920
I mean, Grindah still can't
believe how quickly I've
done it all, so...

00:28.960 --> 00:31.440
He said I'm so organised
that it's insane.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.480
It's actually just practical.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.880
Have you got...
Have you sorted it?

00:38.920 --> 00:41.280
No, I'm gonna see how
this looks and then...

00:41.320 --> 00:43.920
-Cos I'm sure
it'll look good on him.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.320
-Then I'll just go from there
and decide what I'm gonna do.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.800
How we looking in there?
Is it looking good?

00:51.840 --> 00:54.200
<i>I can't wait to see
Grindah in his outfit.</i>

00:54.240 --> 00:57.880
He looks good in everything so
I know he's gonna look sick
in this outfit.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.840
Definitely. Yeah. He looks like
a JD Sports model anyway.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.879
Come on, let's see it then.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.240
I think it's a bit much, man.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.520
Yeah.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.000
Turn around, Steves.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.760
He's gonna hate it.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.160
The colouring's wrong
for a start.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.400
-It's more darker than that.
-More olive.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.400
Yeah. And he's older now
so it's gonna be even darker

01:26.440 --> 01:28.760
than when I last saw it.
Take it off.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.640
-Try something else?
-Yeah. That's not gonna work.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.880
-Stag, stag!
-Slag, slag, slag,
slag, slag, slag!

01:36.920 --> 01:39.240
-Why do you keep saying slag?
-I thought we're saying "slag".

01:39.280 --> 01:41.800
-No, "stag". Stag, stag, stag...
-Oh, stag!

01:41.840 --> 01:44.440
Chabsie! You old cock-sniffer.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.320
Guys, just keep it down.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.600
I thought you were the boss,
do whatever you want.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.040
I am the boss, definitely,
but just keep it quiet, yeah?

01:52.080 --> 01:54.280
Anyway, what costume you lot
got, you bloody mentalist?

01:54.320 --> 01:56.480
It's top secret.
You'll see it tonight.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.880
You'll see it tonight, yeah?
Stag, stag...

01:58.920 --> 02:01.560
-Steve, don't overdo it, mate.
Pick your moments.
-Sorry, it's my first one.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.240
-Charlie?
-Yes, mate? Hi.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.000
You were up for
some extra hours.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.520
-Would you take a delivery
later? Be much appreciated.
-Yeah, no...

02:08.560 --> 02:10.280
-Thanks, bud.
-Cheers, mate.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.800
Thank you very much for
your hard work, continue.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.640
-Crack it on.
-You gotta stay late for
a delivery or something?

02:15.680 --> 02:18.600
No, mate, I'll get him to do it.
But I tell you what.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.880
The way he was speaking to me,
yeah, it's just fucking
disrespectful, yeah?

02:22.920 --> 02:26.120
He should know that I'm
the fucking boss around here.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.600
-Why are you whispering?
-No, I'm just whispering cos
I don't wanna, like, alert...

02:29.640 --> 02:32.160
-Charlie, would you help
out back, please?
-Yeah, yeah, sure, mate.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.040
-I'll tell you what,
I'll help out back.
-Yeah.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.640
-Yeah. OK, thanks.
-Charlie, stag, stag, stag!

02:36.680 --> 02:39.280
[director] Are you looking
forward to the stag do?

02:39.320 --> 02:41.560
-Oh, the stag. Yes.
-Course we are!

02:41.600 --> 02:44.240
-Yeah, yeah.
-It's gonna be
a night all about me,

02:44.280 --> 02:46.280
-designed by him.
-We're gonna wind
him up so much.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.000
-You're not gonna wind me up.
-But that's a stag do, innit?

02:49.040 --> 02:52.160
No. Don't make me look like...
Do you know what I mean?

02:52.200 --> 02:54.920
I like having a laugh as much
as the next man, yeah,

02:54.960 --> 02:57.480
but don't try laughing at me
on my own stag do, like.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.480
That just takes the piss.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.480
[all] Stag, stag, stag,
stag, stag, stag!

03:02.520 --> 03:05.240
-[laughter]
-He loves it!

03:05.280 --> 03:08.040
Stag, stag, stag, stag!

03:08.080 --> 03:10.440
Do a turtle kick. Go.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.840
Oh-ho, he's a turtle!

03:12.880 --> 03:14.400
[laughter]

03:14.440 --> 03:16.640
Oh, come on!

03:16.680 --> 03:18.640
[laughter]

03:18.680 --> 03:21.080
[director] Why are you
wearing the outfit?

03:21.120 --> 03:25.160
It's Grindah's stag night
and he said the best man
has to wear the suit.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.120
Exactly, I'm not wearing
that bollocks. Gonna look
like a twat all night.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.360
-Meant to be having the night
of my bloody life.
-Just get in the way to be fair.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.120
It's actually
really inconvenient.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.280
-Come on, you love it.
-Yeah. Shall we get
some drinks in, anyway?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.320
-Yeah.
-Bucas?

03:42.360 --> 03:44.480
-OK.
-Is it my round?

03:44.520 --> 03:46.840
-It's always your round, Steves.
-Bucas, yeah?

03:46.880 --> 03:50.240
[all sing] <i> ♪ When I saw you</i>

04:00.160 --> 04:03.120
Steves, don't get bucas,
that's disgusting.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.440
Get some proper drinks in.
Round of apple sourz.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.480
-Yes! Apple sourz.
-Yes, come on.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.080
Can't wait to get these
down my bloody throat. [laughs]

04:12.120 --> 04:13.960
Just take it out of that.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.040
[Steves] <i> Since the</i>
<i>inheritance money came through,</i>

04:16.079 --> 04:20.079
I've actually been promoted
to Kurupt FM accountant.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.640
[director] So do you pay
for everything as well?

04:22.680 --> 04:25.120
Yeah, that's what an
accountant does, actually.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.640
It's basically people
who work for the company.

04:28.680 --> 04:33.760
They say to you, "You pay
for that now, cos you're
the accountant."

04:33.800 --> 04:38.520
So very much the money man
of the operation.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.280
-Did you get any beers?
-No, I thought you said
get apple sourz.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.800
-Get the beers in,
Stevie, come on.
-Beers as well, yeah?

04:44.840 --> 04:47.000
We're going mental tonight.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.200
[Chabsie] Marky Mark.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.840
-How you doing? You all right?
-Yeah. Good, thanks.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.160
Listen, I was wondering if you
could do me a really big
favour, mate.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.040
You know that delivery that's
coming later on, could
you possibly stay for it?

04:59.080 --> 05:02.480
No, I can't,
I've got stuff on later. Sorry.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.720
-What, like, what stuff?
-Just stuff, you know?

05:05.760 --> 05:09.760
No, I don't know. Why don't you
tell me, mate? Because I've
got this stag coming up.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.160
It's quite important,
so, like, please.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.200
Yeah, I gotta go pick up some
medicine for my mum. She's sick.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.680
Well, what's wrong with her?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.560
Sorry, mate. No, that's
bang out of order.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.520
[Carol] Oh, my fucking God!
Look at the size of it!

05:25.560 --> 05:28.440
Oh, here comes the bride!

05:28.480 --> 05:31.920
-You got me a Hummer!
-Yeah. The one
you told me to get.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.440
Yeah, not exactly. The image
reference I sent you was a pink
one but, yeah, not to worry.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.360
-I couldn't find a pink one.
-It's fine. It shouldn't
ruin it, so...

05:38.400 --> 05:42.240
Miche did choose me
to be her Maid of Honour,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.400
which was a surprise,
definitely.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.360
Yeah, we're always surprising
each other, aren't we?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.840
I mean, that's just what
best friends do.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.800
I can't be your
best friend, can I?

05:50.840 --> 05:54.640
-I surprised you again, bestie!
-Oh, you got me.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.960
-Put these on, babe?
-No, this isn't some cheap,
tacky hen do. We got a Hummer.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
[director]
Who's organised the hen do?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.640
It's sort of a mix of the two
minds, isn't it? Mostly mine.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.320
-Yeah, mostly yours.
-With a little
sprinkling of you.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.320
Can you have a little word
with Jackie as well.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.040
I'm not sure about
what she's wearing.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.320
It's not part of the colour
palette we agreed.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.240
-If you just wanna
have a quick...
-No, I'll do that.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.560
Roche hasn't really been
to parties before,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.280
so I'm teaching her about
how to have fun and
sort of going out,

06:20.320 --> 06:23.760
and that kinda thing, so,
yeah, we've done a lot of brain
storming on what a night out is.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.240
-Just cos it's not pink.
-OK, stick those in the bag.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.000
-Are you in? OK.
-Smile!

06:30.040 --> 06:32.600
-Miche! Whooo, Miche!
-Back to pout.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.160
Fish face.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.240
-Right, now in, come on.
-OK.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.720
Oh, come on, it's all right.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.720
Can I just say, this is the
comfiest thing I've ever sat on.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.080
We're gonna have
a good night tonight!

06:46.120 --> 06:47.440
Yay!

06:50.040 --> 06:53.280
Down your throat. Oooh!

06:53.320 --> 06:57.000
Really lukewarm.
Absolutely mental, you are.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.920
Oh, what's going on here
then, mate?

07:00.960 --> 07:03.160
What, are you Grindah?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.760
-Oh! OK.
-No, that's Grindah.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.120
I see what's going on.
You absolute bastard, Beats.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.440
Yes, I am he.
Please go easy on me.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.800
Why are you in
the costume then?

07:14.840 --> 07:17.800
-Cos he said I had to wear it.
-You're here for me, so...

07:17.840 --> 07:21.280
A stripper is one
of the most important
things on a stag night.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.200
I went for the one that
looked most like Miche,

07:24.240 --> 07:29.480
cos I think he'd like that.
Got the number from
a phone box. Old school.

07:29.520 --> 07:34.680
-Come on.
-Are we going to a hotel or you
wanna do me in the toilets here?

07:34.720 --> 07:39.560
What? Just normal, on the table,
in front of everyone.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.080
Oh, shit!

07:44.120 --> 07:46.800
I'm really sorry. My mistake.

07:46.840 --> 07:51.080
I thought you was a stripper. I
didn't realise you were actually
a fully blown prostitute.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.040
Uh! You got me a brass.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.080
-Disgusting.
-It's not disgusting,
actually, thank you very much.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.520
Well, I'm not going anywhere
near that, cos I don't know
what you might have.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.240
-I don't know what
you might have.
-I haven't got anything.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.480
Clean as a whistle.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.440
Well, anyone else?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.680
Someone can come with me.
You might be quick.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.480
Yeah, Steves'll do it.
Go on, Steves.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.920
Can I just pay you to not
to have to do anything?

08:15.960 --> 08:20.280
Well, you can do, yeah. You
can give me some money, that's
all right. Yeah, all right then.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.000
All right, I'll just pay you
and then we don't have to.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.560
-No, that's fine.
Just give the money.
-It's 140, Steves.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.520
No, it's 160, actually.
We said 160 on the phone.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.920
-I think there's
another couple.
-Another one of those?

08:31.960 --> 08:34.440
-Thank you. Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, and you.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.200
Thank you. [coughs]

08:37.240 --> 08:41.679
Fucking hell, I thought you
was gonna get me a stripper
and a sick night and that.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.160
Sitting in fucking pubs
with prostitutes.
Worst night of my life.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.600
-Hurray!
-Woo-hoo!

08:48.640 --> 08:52.680
I wish I'd worn something I
could flash with, lift it up.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.080
Guys, no. Guys, sorry, no!

08:55.120 --> 08:58.360
You're spoiling the look.
We want everyone to think
we're high-class celebrities.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.680
-I'm only having a laugh.
-Let's just have a bit of this
"Proseccio" and enjoy ourselves.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.760
No, I'm all right, thanks.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.600
Take a glass for the photos
and it'll look like you're fun.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.280
-Everyone want a drink?
-Fuck it, I'll have
a little one.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.120
[all] Whoooo!

09:15.880 --> 09:18.000
Right, I'm off, mate.
See you tomorrow.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.400
Yeah, all right, mate. Hope
your mum gets better, yeah?

09:20.440 --> 09:22.160
Yeah, cool.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.680
Dickhead!

09:27.160 --> 09:32.560
Grindah said he wanted the
best night of his life and
that's what I'm gonna give him.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.640
[mobile buzzes]

09:35.680 --> 09:38.160
-Yes, mate?
-[Beats] <i> Where you at, mate?</i>

09:38.200 --> 09:40.280
No, I'm still waiting
for this bhenchod delivery.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.800
<i>What's the name of
that strip club you go to?</i>

09:42.840 --> 09:45.400
-Oh, you're going titty bar.
<i>-Yeah, if we can find it.</i>

09:45.440 --> 09:47.600
OK, listen, don't go
to the Blue Lion, OK?

09:47.640 --> 09:49.520
Go to the one
behind Soho Street.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.560
They have more intense
lighting so it's a bit more HD.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.280
We're next to the theatre in
Centrals. Where do we go now?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.760
-Which way is it?
-Left.

-Where now? Right?
-Oh, for fuck's sake, Beats!

10:00.880 --> 10:03.040
-No, left.
-We just came from there!

10:03.080 --> 10:06.200
-Is it this way or not?
-Is it this way or not?

10:06.240 --> 10:09.680

where we are.
-Is it at the end of this road?

10:11.760 --> 10:13.600
No, it's down there.
See you in a bit, Chabs.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.760
All right, in a bit,

10:18.360 --> 10:20.240
Come on!

10:20.280 --> 10:22.360
It's straight down the end here,
through the alleyway.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.320
-Definitely?
-Oh-ho!

10:24.360 --> 10:25.920
Someone's going strip club
and it's me.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.720
Strip club!

-[Carol] Ooh, hello!
-Oh, we're nearly at karaoke!

10:34.520 --> 10:38.000
Roche, are you OK to pop ahead,
hon, and make sure everything's
all ready for us?

10:38.040 --> 10:42.440
-Yeah, I'll do a soundcheck.
-Thanks, bestie. It's perfect.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.760
I haven't got drunk
since I got pregnant, really.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.520
So I'm a bit worried that if
I get back into it, I'll start
enjoying it a bit too much.

10:49.560 --> 10:53.320
You know what it's like, right?
One minute you're having
a couple of Stellas,

10:53.360 --> 10:57.120
next thing you know you've
blacked out and put a brick
through Craig's dad's window.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.680
Who's gonna go first? I got
the perfect song to get us
all started.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.320
-Yeah, well, I'm doing Biggie.
-No. Sorry, no, no, no.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.480
No one's singing what they want.
I've already got it planned out.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.480
You just need to get in there
and just have some fun.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.120
-Oh, my God!
-All right, well,
Roche is gonna go first.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.560
-Yeah, run ahead, perfect, yeah.
-I'll run out.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.240
-All right, I'm going.
-Oh, my God, I can't
believe we're here!

11:17.280 --> 11:19.520

because I couldn't be fucked
with all the intense planning.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.760
Craig, have you done
that soundcheck?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.640
Just make sure it's
working, yeah?

11:31.680 --> 11:34.640
I would rather stick up a few
lights in my living room,

11:34.680 --> 11:39.000
than go round every single
karaoke bar in London
with Miche.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.040

-Just follow all the arrows
to the fun.

start doing my head in,

11:47.760 --> 11:49.840
I can always escape
upstairs to bed.

-We agreed on...
-Oh, yeah. No, I know.

They're not gonna disturb us.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.520
I'll just lock them in his room
once he's got a snack, yeah?

-Sooner rather than later.
-OK.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.720
-Yes!

I thought you were
the stripper.

And he's going upstairs,
but this is all sorted, yeah?

So, welcome, everyone, to my
hen party. Such a pleasure
to have you all here.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.680
So I'm gonna be hosting
the evening along with
my Maid of Honour,

12:40.720 --> 12:44.040
and I'd love to give her a big
round of applause to thank her
for the use of her venue

12:44.080 --> 12:46.680
for our lovely fun hen party.
Thank you, Roche.

-Lovely decorations.

I mean, it's not me.
-When did you find the time?

12:53.480 --> 12:56.200
-Well, I haven't done...
That was all Miche.
-That's all me.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.880

those pictures of Miche
on my wall.

-Yeah.
-I mean, that's...

any pictures of anything,

-That's fizzy that, innit?
-Yeah, it is.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.480
So the reason that I picked
this song is actually,

16:31.520 --> 16:33.800
because it's not only about
mine and Grindah's love story,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.000
but I think it applies to mine
and Roche's friendship as well.

-Yeah? Well, next time...
-Quick, quick.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.240
How was it?

20:29.280 --> 20:32.480
-God, mate!
-Mine was well safe as well.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.880
No. Not safe. I mean, she was
literally staring in my eyes
the whole time,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.760
and kept saying, like, that
she wanted me to stay
for another dance,

20:39.800 --> 20:42.880
cos she couldn't get enough
of me. It was like
she was obsessed with me.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.840
I may never get this
opportunity again.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.560
If I don't go for it, I might
regret it for the rest
of my life.

20:49.760 --> 20:54.000
Bruv, like...
Maybe I'm rushing into this
whole marriage thing, right?

20:54.040 --> 20:56.240
-What?
-Yeah.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.320
She kept saying there was
something about me
and she's right.

20:59.360 --> 21:03.680
Look at her. She can get
anyone she wants in here
and she chose me.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.800
-What about Miche though?
-You gonna buy me that
drink then or what?

21:07.840 --> 21:10.960
So, Beats, I'm gonna have to...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.360
Could I get, erm...?

21:16.400 --> 21:19.320
-Champagne, please.
-OK, yeah.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.560
[Grindah] <i> Listen, life's full</i>
<i>of big decisions, yeah?</i>
<i>Make one wrong turn,</i>

21:22.600 --> 21:25.560
bang, you can regret
that shit forever, yeah?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.840
The main thing to do is never
admit that you've made
that wrong move.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.840
<i>That way, you'll have
no regrets in life.</i>

21:34.680 --> 21:37.200
So, Jackie, there's no need
to interfere with any of that.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.960
I've picked all the songs that
you want to sing. Just need
to enjoy yourself, yeah?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.520
Great. What we having?

21:42.560 --> 21:45.080
-Vodka.
-Very good.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.440
Cheers. Whole fucking jug!
I nearly fucking went then.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.040
Best friends shot time.
There you go, you know.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.520
Stare into my eyes.
What colour are your eyes?

21:54.560 --> 21:57.240
Brown. Really nice,
very chocolatey.

21:57.280 --> 22:01.560
'Ere, babe? What time's
the stripper coming?

22:01.600 --> 22:04.240
Yeah, no, we're not
having a stripper, Mum.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.400
You've gotta have your
stripper though, babe.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.760
-Maybe we should just
fuck it and get one.
-Do you think?

22:08.800 --> 22:11.160
Don't you feel like we're
going a bit too mental?

22:11.200 --> 22:13.720
Miche? As your best mate,

22:13.760 --> 22:17.120
I can honestly say we are
going nowhere near too mental.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.720
-Come on.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.960

22:32.800 --> 22:35.120
Where the fuck is he, man?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.200
I reckon he might
have gone with her.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.240
He's all right.
He's having a good time, innit?

22:41.280 --> 22:44.040
He's been an hour and a half.
That's like three grand.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.280
It's Steve's money anyway.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.280
I'm gonna go and have
a look for him, yeah?

22:48.320 --> 22:49.720
Grindah!

22:49.760 --> 22:51.120
Oi!

22:51.160 --> 22:53.200
-Oh, sorry.
-Get out.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.480
Grindah!

22:57.920 --> 23:01.120
Grindah! Oi, where's Grindah?

23:01.160 --> 23:03.600
I dunno. What do you mean?

23:03.640 --> 23:05.720
What are you doing?
Why are you dancing?

23:05.760 --> 23:07.880
Felt a bit weird just
her dancing on her own.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.360
Come on, man,
we need to find him.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.760
-What do you mean?
-He's going mad.
Come on, let's find him.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.280
-Steve!
-Sorry. Gotta go.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.480
Nice one. See you later.
Keep working on the gun fingers.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.880
Grindah!

23:22.920 --> 23:25.160
-Grindah!
-Grindah!

23:28.280 --> 23:30.720
Oh, Monica. How you doing?

23:30.760 --> 23:32.600
Listen, I've only got
a tenner here.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.520
Can you do pay as you go,
just last time?

23:34.560 --> 23:36.640
-Grindah!
-Grindah!

23:36.680 --> 23:39.760
-Grindah!
-Seen my mate?
He's dressed as a turtle.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.600
-Tenner, like, two minutes.
-Chabsie.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.280
-Can you do that thing where you
make your arse flap really fast?
-Chabs.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.520
-Yeah.
-I can't find Grindah, man.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.120
-He's run off with
a fucking stripper.
-Listen, mate, tell me about it.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.320
Been there, done that, bought
the T-shirt, she robbed the
T-shirt and fucked off, mate.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.160
-Yeah, I know, but...
Oh, there she is.
-Grindah!

23:57.200 --> 24:00.160
-Oi, where's Grindah? What
have you done with him?
-What?

24:00.200 --> 24:03.040
Don't play dumb with me. You
know exactly what I'm talking
about. Where is he?

24:03.080 --> 24:05.480
-Are you fucking joking?
-You fell in love with him.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.240
-Who?
-Grindah!

24:07.280 --> 24:09.120
-Oh, my God, are you joking?
-Gorgeous, green eyes.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.360
You think I fell in love
with him? That's my job.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.080
-I tell everyone that
they've got beautiful eyes.
-What?!

24:14.120 --> 24:16.920
-Can you just get these pricks
out of my face, please?
-All right.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.040
-Everything's fine.
-She's ruining
my mate's marriage.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.320
-Oh, yeah! Come on, get out!
-Come on, boys.

24:21.360 --> 24:25.840
-Out you get.
-I'm a regular, Gazzy,
Guzzle. Ten pounds.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.520
-I don't want it. What,
you think I'm a stripper?
-No, no, no.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.400
-You could be if you wanted to.
-Come here!

24:31.440 --> 24:33.880
-Come here!
-Aah!

24:33.920 --> 24:37.920
-Come here.
-Oh, watch the ponytail!
It's insured, bhenchod!

24:37.960 --> 24:40.240
-Aaah! Aaah!
-Go on.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.240
He might still be in there.
Can I just check?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.800
-No. You're not going in there.
-Come on, mate.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.760
-Just wanna check.
-I'm a regular. Come on,
one dance, just me.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.480
-Has he texted any of you lot?
Decoy, has he texted you?
-Nah.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.400
I'll tell you what, shall we
go to another titty bar

24:53.440 --> 24:55.680
and then he can
just meet us there?

24:55.720 --> 24:57.360
Nah.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.440
-I feel like I let him down.
-[Steves] No, man.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.200
That was well safe earlier
when you got him
a prostitute and that.

25:03.240 --> 25:07.120
You got him a prostitute?
What was she like?

25:07.160 --> 25:11.280
I'll tell you one thing, mate.
She doesn't look like
she does on the card.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.040
Do you think
he's still in there?

25:17.360 --> 25:20.240
He loved it,
from what I saw, like.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.680
I think he was having
a good time.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.400
[Grindah] <i> The thing is, yeah?</i>
<i>Like, I didn't think</i>
<i>she was my one and only before,</i>

25:30.440 --> 25:33.800
cos I always thought there's
better birds out there and
that, and there is, but,

25:33.840 --> 25:38.280
it's just, you never really
see 'em, so just settle
for what you've got.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.320
-[director] Settle for?
-Yeah.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.160
Settle, that's a positive.
I feel settled right now.

-What the fuck you doing here?

26:00.200 --> 26:02.080
-Shh, I'm here to see Miche.
-You all right?

26:02.120 --> 26:04.680
Yeah. I've had a revelation.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.520
I choose you over everyone.
I don't want anyone else.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.560
-Oh, he's just figured out
what marriage is about.
-Shut up, Mum!

26:10.600 --> 26:13.960
-What's happened?
-Tonight's made me
realise what I've got.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.920
Really, really good looks,
and there's gonna be
temptations out there,

26:18.960 --> 26:22.240
-but I don't wanna
fuck this up ever again.
-OK.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.880
Me, neither. I like
your tortoise costume.
You look really cute.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.080
'Ere, maybe he could give us
a little dance, yeah, in your
sexy little costume.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.520
It's not sexy.
It's a Ninja Turtle, so...

26:31.560 --> 26:34.560
-He's quite buff under
that Lycra, in't he?
-Yeah, look at his little bum!

26:34.600 --> 26:38.040
-You can't see my bum,
the shell's covering it.
-You could be our stripper!

26:38.080 --> 26:40.440
-Yeah, go on.
-It's easy to be a stripper,
it's easy.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.680
-Go on, show us your legs.
-Ooh, it's hard, isn't it?

26:42.720 --> 26:44.960
Oh, that's so hard,
isn't it? Yeah?

26:45.000 --> 26:48.640
-Look at him!
-He's good, in't he? It saves
us having to pay for one.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.760
-Look at him!
-There's just nothing to it.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.680
-OK.
-Yay!

26:54.720 --> 26:57.320
This is every girl's dream,
innit?

26:57.360 --> 26:59.920
-Oh, perfect!
-Ooh, you like that?

26:59.960 --> 27:02.880
[Tanya] Grindah by name,
grinder by nature!

27:02.920 --> 27:05.320
-Ooh, hello.
-Off! Off! Off! Off!

27:05.360 --> 27:08.120
-Want me to take it
off do you? Yeah?
-Yeah! Whooo!

27:08.160 --> 27:11.800
-Whoooo!
-Put the shell
between your legs.

[Miche] <i> I think the future</i>
<i>for me is all about getting</i>
<i>a much bigger house.</i>

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000

Grindahs and Miches.</i>

27:19.040 --> 27:22.120
[Grindah] <i> Well, yeah,</i>
<i>I mean, don't need to talk</i>

getting Miche back.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.440

[Grindah laughs]
I'm good at this, ain't I?

27:43.920 --> 27:46.800
I'm good at this. Yeah. Yeah.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.960
-So, you live round here?
-Yeah, sort of. Erm...

27:51.000 --> 27:54.400
-I'm kinda in between
addresses at the moment.
-Oh, me too.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.240
-Yeah, it's hard, isn't it?
-Yeah, it's just here actually.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.320
So if you just
jump in the van, really.

28:00.360 --> 28:04.640
-What, in the back?
-Yeah, I've got everything
sorted, you'll see.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.200
Oh.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.480
-Oh, yeah. Oh.
-Yeah.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.000
So, what's your name again?

28:11.040 --> 28:15.080
Er, my name?
Erm, my name's, er...Charlie.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.080
-You look a bit like
a Charlie, actually.
-Yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.360
Can you do a Polish accent?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
No.
