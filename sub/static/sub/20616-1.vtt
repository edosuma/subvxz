WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:12.778
I'm getting violence here.

00:12.780 --> 00:16.181
I'm seeing a body on the floor.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.083
I've been pushed down
these stairs.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.252
Somebody fell down the stairs.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.989
He will get really
aggressive and yell.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.793
This is a child murderer.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.361
That pisses me off.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.931
This is super bad.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.434
This is not a good situation.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.269
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.904
There's death here.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.639
Don't wanna go down there.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.874
I see dead people.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.976
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:43.978 --> 00:46.645
I speak to dead people...

00:46.647 --> 00:49.448
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.283
...and they speak to me.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.419
She's going to torture them.

00:53.421 --> 00:57.222
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.358
They were all murdered.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.892
I rely on my partner.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.428
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.262
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.965
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:06.967 --> 01:10.535
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.537 --> 01:14.339
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.041
It's my job to reveal them.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.676
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.845
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:19.847 --> 01:21.880
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.148
...until the very end.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.750
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.852
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:26.854 --> 01:28.353
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.988
Or time to get out.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.023
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.440
I'm back here
in Flint, Michigan,

01:48.442 --> 01:50.408
about an hour west of Detroit.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.678
This time, I got a call
from a mom named Carrie.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.880
Now she says
whatever's in the house

01:54.882 --> 01:57.382
is real angry and real violent.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.017
She's got four little girls
to protect

01:59.019 --> 02:01.520
and has no clue on how to do it.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.522
She's hoping Amy and I can
come up with something

02:03.524 --> 02:05.491
before someone
gets seriously hurt.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.663
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

02:11.665 --> 02:14.599
of any leading information --

02:14.601 --> 02:17.269
photographs,
religious icons.

02:17.271 --> 02:21.807
Even children's toys
can influence her findings,

02:21.809 --> 02:25.144
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.945
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

02:26.947 --> 02:29.114
for tonight's walk.

02:39.193 --> 02:43.362
The first thing that I got
was...

02:43.364 --> 02:47.566
in huge, like, bold letters...

02:47.568 --> 02:50.469
was the word "sad."

02:54.775 --> 02:58.176
First thing I'm getting
is a woman upstairs,

02:58.178 --> 02:59.845
and she wants me to
come up there

02:59.847 --> 03:02.881
because she's saying that
the children are in danger.

03:04.384 --> 03:07.319
She's freaking out.
She's freaking out.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.062
So, Carrie, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:17.064 --> 03:18.697
you sounded pretty upset.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.931
What's happening?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.134
This place is tearing
my family apart,

03:22.136 --> 03:25.070
mentally, physically,

03:25.072 --> 03:27.572
and emotionally.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.508
And then my children...

03:29.510 --> 03:32.444
my children are scared
to even be here.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.479
How long have you actually
lived in the house?

03:34.481 --> 03:37.949
I have lived here
a little over 21/2 years.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.250
Okay.

03:39.252 --> 03:42.420
And when my husband's
grandparents passed away,

03:42.422 --> 03:43.622
we got the home.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.491
Did his grandparents
pass away in the house?

03:46.493 --> 03:47.525
No, they did not.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.696
They passed away
in a nursing home.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.598
Who exactly
lives in the house?

03:53.600 --> 03:56.901
You got myself,
my husband, Chad.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.539
You got my daughter Ariana,
who is 11.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.574
You got my daughter Victoria,
who is 10,

04:03.576 --> 04:05.777
my daughter Layla,
who is 5.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.112
and then Gabrielle,
who is 3.

04:08.114 --> 04:09.214
So, Carrie, do me a favor.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.717
Give me a list of things
that are happening.

04:11.719 --> 04:15.153
We're hearing voices,
footsteps.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.853
Our health is declining.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.923
We're getting
physical attacks.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.926
I'm seeing shadow figures.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.730
Is everybody being affected,
or is it just specific people?

04:24.732 --> 04:27.165
It's affecting my husband.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.867
We were happily married.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.771
Recently, he started becoming
really depressed.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.207
What makes you so convinced
that his changes

04:36.209 --> 04:38.142
have anything to do
with the paranormal?

04:38.144 --> 04:42.280
Because before we moved
into here, we never fought.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.550
And then his depression
started kicking in.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.984
Once second, he's happy,

04:46.986 --> 04:49.755
and the next minute, he's
snapping and yelling at people,

04:49.757 --> 04:53.225
trying to accuse me of doing
something wrong that I'm not.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.626
Okay.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.028
I think there's something here
that is attached to him.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.896
It won't let him go.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.765
Whatever is going on can't
be good for the marriage.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.801
No.
This could be the end of it

05:02.803 --> 05:05.870
if we don't figure out
what is going on.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.772
You know, it's heartbreaking
to listen to you talk.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.508
And, you know, one of
the reasons I took the case

05:09.510 --> 05:11.242
is 'cause of the kids.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.744
But it sounds like
you're the one

05:12.746 --> 05:14.579
that really needs
the help here.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.781
Yeah.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.618
I ain't got no one
to turn to.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.720
And I need help.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.623
I want this fixed.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.658
I want to be better.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.799
There's a male,
and he's over to my right.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.133
He's dead.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.503
He's like,
"Lies! They're saying lies!"

05:38.505 --> 05:43.275
His energy is <i> crazy</i> strong.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.109
I'm getting violence here.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.411
"Aah!"

05:48.382 --> 05:52.150
Like, I'm hearing a living man
yelling,

05:52.152 --> 05:55.153
screaming, crying,
wanting to kill.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.892
Something is influencing males

06:00.894 --> 06:02.594
to be violent.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.101
So you brought me up here.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.969
I'm assuming you've
had experiences.

06:11.971 --> 06:15.574
Yeah. I have been seeing
a small shadow.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.175
Well, how tall
are we talking about?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.644
Probably about
my daughter Layla's size.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.579
Could that shadow
have been Layla?

06:21.581 --> 06:24.382
No, because when
I come up here and check,

06:24.384 --> 06:25.717
either Layla is sleeping

06:25.719 --> 06:28.586
or she's gone at her grandma's
for the weekend.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.790
Okay. Have you seen any other
shadows besides that one?

06:31.792 --> 06:35.059
Yeah. I've seen one that is
a lot taller than that one.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.461
How often you seeing these?

06:36.463 --> 06:37.696
- Daily.
- Daily?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.997
- Yeah.
- Anything else?

06:39.999 --> 06:43.935
I've been pushed down
these stairs.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.104
I actually broke my foot.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.005
You're lucky you
didn't get killed.
Yeah.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.708
How hard did you get pushed?
Show me. Give me a shove.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.077
- Like that.
- All right.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.080
So you know how lucky
you are, right?
Yes.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.748
I mean, you could have got
knocked unconscious,

06:56.750 --> 06:59.151
broke your neck, anything.
- Yeah.

07:01.621 --> 07:04.088
The dead guy,
he knows that he can

07:04.090 --> 07:06.424
take his energy and throw it.

07:06.426 --> 07:11.696
Living people, I'd think,
be prone to falls here.

07:11.698 --> 07:15.367
When he puts out
his energy like this,

07:15.369 --> 07:17.969
it definitely affects
your equilibrium.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.905
People would feel like
their feet

07:19.907 --> 07:22.540
are coming out from under them.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.710
Somebody fell down the stairs.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.815
If he is able to...

07:30.817 --> 07:34.051
throw somebody down the stairs,

07:34.053 --> 07:36.021
that's not good.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.261
Okay, what's going on
up here?

07:43.263 --> 07:47.199
Well, I have been touched
inappropriately in the bathroom.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.399
Mind me asking what happened?

07:48.401 --> 07:50.034
I thought it was Chad.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.803
It felt like somebody
just grabbed my rear.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.006
I jumped out the shower
pretty quick.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.208
And I went and yelled
at Chad, you know,

07:57.210 --> 07:58.877
"Why the hell
did you do that?"

07:58.879 --> 08:01.813
And I look in here, and he's in
the bedroom, sitting on the bed.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.781
Now did that ever
happen again?

08:03.783 --> 08:05.283
Yeah.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.351
It happened one more time when
I was laying in bed at night.

08:07.353 --> 08:08.286
Same touch?

08:08.288 --> 08:11.188
Like, the inside of my legs.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.758
- Okay. And...
- Chad was sleeping.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.959
Okay. Not that
I'm not believing you,

08:14.961 --> 08:16.627
but, I mean,
you have a dog right here.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.030
You sure she or he
didn't just...

08:19.032 --> 08:20.365
No, 'cause at the time,

08:20.367 --> 08:22.767
she was sleeping
down in the living room.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.168
All right.
What else is going on?

08:24.170 --> 08:27.038
My declining health.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.709
I have had
four partial hysterectomies.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.979
I have had
my appendix taken out.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.712
I've had my gall bladder
taken out.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.582
Whenever I'm getting anxiety,

08:37.583 --> 08:40.784
it makes me feel like
I'm having a heart attack.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.653
Well, living here and telling me
what you're going through --

08:42.655 --> 08:43.855
getting pushed down
a flight of stairs,

08:43.857 --> 08:46.190
somebody grabbing your...
in the shower,

08:46.192 --> 08:48.326
I mean, I'd be
a little anxious, too.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.861
This house is killing me.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.563
What are you hoping
we can do for you?

08:51.565 --> 08:54.933
I am hoping that my relationship
with my husband

08:54.935 --> 08:58.203
goes back to normal
like it was.

08:58.205 --> 09:02.840
I'm worried that we're gonna
end up going our separate ways.

09:02.842 --> 09:06.545
I want to be the way we were
2 years ago,

09:06.547 --> 09:07.946
happily married.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.750
I think if living people
are having the experience,

09:12.752 --> 09:15.954
I could kind of see them

09:15.956 --> 09:19.624
possibly thinking
they were being grabbed.

09:19.626 --> 09:24.229
And I got a bad pain in my head,
really, really bad.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.497
Ooh, ooh.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.300
Wow. What did he do?

09:28.302 --> 09:29.701
Ooh.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.037
I'm nauseous and dizzy.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.839
The left side of my head
is wicked bad.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.510
Mnh.

09:38.512 --> 09:41.179
I think this is associated
with the dead male.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.516
He's yelling, "You stupid!
Ha, ha, ha!"

10:06.106 --> 10:07.905
Ariana and Victoria,
correct?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.074
Yeah.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.207
Okay.
Ariana, how old are you?

10:10.209 --> 10:11.743
-11.
- You're 11. Victoria?

10:11.745 --> 10:12.911
- I'm 10.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.879
Now let me ask you guys
a question.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.514
Do you want to stay
in the house?

10:16.516 --> 10:19.917
I don't really feel like
staying here most of the time.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.954
Like, my eyes water up
and I start crying.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.189
Can you tell me about some of
the things that frighten you?

10:25.191 --> 10:26.891
I was getting ready
to fall asleep,

10:26.893 --> 10:30.061
and something grabbed
my foot.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.796
Okay.
When your foot got grabbed,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.531
show me how hard,
on my wrist, how you...

10:33.533 --> 10:36.301
It grabbed me
just like that. Like, hard.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.469
Really?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.170
What about you, Victoria?
What's going on?

10:39.172 --> 10:42.073
I have bad nightmares.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.109
Okay.
Do you remember them?

10:44.111 --> 10:48.012
All I remember about them,
my mom had to,

10:48.014 --> 10:50.481
and my stepdad,
had to wake me up.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.951
Ariana, anything else that
you've seen that scared you?

10:52.953 --> 10:55.954
I have seen a really tall
shadow man

10:55.956 --> 11:00.091
with, like, a top hat
and facial hair.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.360
Okay. Now where did you
see that?

11:02.362 --> 11:04.929
It is mainly
in the hallways.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.167
Are you sure it wasn't
your stepdad?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.802
Yes.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.305
So, guys, I was talking
to Mom and Dad.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.108
I'm curious. Have you seen
a change in either one of them?

11:17.110 --> 11:19.310
Chad. He's been
getting really mean.

11:19.312 --> 11:23.381
When your stepdad Chad
gets angry, what happens?

11:23.383 --> 11:27.919
He will get really aggressive
and yell above his normal voice.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.287
That's not good.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.128
I- I...

11:37.130 --> 11:39.864
feel like there's...

11:39.866 --> 11:42.200
two living females

11:42.202 --> 11:45.403
that are...hiding,

11:45.405 --> 11:49.474
and I'm just hearing, like,
yelling from...

11:49.476 --> 11:51.676
I guess this room.

11:51.678 --> 11:57.782
There is a living male, like,
acting out, like, just snapping.

11:59.753 --> 12:03.288
Like a complete change.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.296
So, Chad, I was talking
to your wife.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.832
In her opinion,
since you guys moved in here,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.900
your personality changed.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.235
- Yeah. I agree with her.
- All right.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.638
So when you're feeling
this change in personality

12:20.640 --> 12:22.974
coming over you, what happens?
How you feeling?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.243
Angry, very angry.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.978
It comes to the point
where I feel like

12:26.980 --> 12:28.746
I want to rip walls apart,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.516
tear 'em down,
anyone in my way.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.317
Your wife told me
about her experiences.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.253
How about you?
Any experiences?

12:35.255 --> 12:37.088
I got out of the shower
one time.

12:37.090 --> 12:41.392
Me and my wife, when we seen
on the mirror, from the fog,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.127
it said "kill" and "die"
on it.

12:43.129 --> 12:46.931
So I ran down the hallway
and woke the girls up

12:46.933 --> 12:48.166
out of a dead sleep.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.868
I was furious.
I told them,

12:49.870 --> 12:51.402
"Are you guys playing games?"
- Right.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.671
They almost started crying,
"It wasn't us.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.206
It wasn't us.
It wasn't us."

12:55.208 --> 12:56.975
You're pretty convinced
the kids didn't do it.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.944
I'm 100%.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.479
Okay. Has anything else
happened?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.215
When I'm sleeping, I feel
like something's choking me

13:04.217 --> 13:05.550
and sitting on my chest.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.717
Wait. Describe
the feeling to me.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.686
It feels like you
can't breathe or...

13:08.688 --> 13:11.289
Sit up and...
You know.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.925
I thought it was trying
to kill me, suffocate me.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.359
Couldn't get no air.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.728
Now do you suffer from any
asthma or anything like that?

13:17.730 --> 13:18.930
No.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.165
Now how were you reacting
when this happened?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.499
Furious.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.000
- Okay.
- Furious.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.803
Furious towards everybody
and everything.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.446
The dead guy,
he can be very physical.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.582
Living people here

13:37.584 --> 13:41.652
will feel their beds jolt,

13:41.654 --> 13:44.923
and it feels like an earthquake.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.395
I think that that guy,

13:50.397 --> 13:54.532
you know, who can direct
his energy,

13:54.534 --> 13:56.534
is doing that.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.736
Like, you're in the shower,
and the shower curtain,

13:58.738 --> 14:00.338
you know, might pull back.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.907
This is super bad.

14:05.679 --> 14:10.748
He's showing people
people sitting, sitting here,

14:10.750 --> 14:15.553
and he's showing me him
smacking them upside the head.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.422
You know? Like, just whap.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.824
All of a sudden,
they start feeling

14:19.826 --> 14:23.127
like they're getting smacked on
the, you know, like...

14:25.564 --> 14:26.864
So from what Carrie told me,

14:26.866 --> 14:28.833
you inherited this house
from your grandparents.

14:28.835 --> 14:29.968
Correct.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.769
How far apart
did they pass away?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.704
A year.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.106
I see you're looking over here.
Is this them?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.574
That is them. Yes, it is.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.010
What did they die from?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.579
Actually, my grandmother
had a brain tumor.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.447
And your grandfather?

14:43.449 --> 14:45.950
He died from gangrene,
pretty much.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.519
And he just kind of rotted
from his feet up.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.853
What kind of guy was he?

14:49.855 --> 14:52.556
He's a good guy,
but he didn't like women.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.858
He had
a very super bad temper.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.127
Any abuse?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.529
Yeah, I've never seen him
ever do physical abuse

14:58.531 --> 15:00.398
but a lot of mental.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.201
Do you think
your grandparents are here?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.536
Yeah. I do.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.205
You think he's taking out
his aggressions

15:07.207 --> 15:08.739
on your wife and kids?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.608
Wife and my kids, yes.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.943
'Cause they're all women.

15:17.216 --> 15:21.886
The dead guy,
he showed me him, like,

15:21.888 --> 15:24.989
grabbing somebody by the neck,

15:24.991 --> 15:27.692
a female, and holding her
up against the wall

15:27.694 --> 15:30.628
to the point where her feet
were, like,

15:30.630 --> 15:32.397
this much off the floor.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.968
Any idea who this dead guy
was in life?

15:37.970 --> 15:39.237
He was white.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.806
Like, max, I would say, 5'10".

15:41.808 --> 15:43.775
I see him with an older woman.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.743
There was abuse.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.679
So he lived here at some point,
and then he died.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.782
He didn't die here,
you know what I'm saying?

15:50.784 --> 15:53.717
But he's back here.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.254
And he's a big problem here.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.137
This is our third investigation
in Flint,

16:13.139 --> 16:15.573
so I've gotten to know a lot
of the local experts here.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.875
One historian
just called me back,

16:17.877 --> 16:20.211
and he said he found
a bizarre string of murders

16:20.213 --> 16:23.081
with a direct connection
to Chad and Carrie's property.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.654
Well, Walt, thanks
for meeting me.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.123
I really appreciate that.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.459
Now you mentioned on the phone
there was a sting of homicides

16:34.461 --> 16:36.126
connected
to my clients' property.

16:36.128 --> 16:39.530
Before we get to that, who owned
the land when this happened?

16:39.532 --> 16:42.533
Well, Steve,
the original landowner

16:42.535 --> 16:44.769
was Thomas Brandt.

16:44.771 --> 16:49.073
He owned over 70,000 acres
of land here in Genesee County.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.408
Okay, 70,000 acres.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.511
Was my client's house
and property even close

16:53.513 --> 16:54.812
to where this guy was?

16:54.814 --> 16:59.250
Yes. As a matter of fact,
Thomas Brandt's estate was here.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.186
Your client's property was
in this area here.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.654
Okay.
So this was pretty close.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.722
Yes.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.089
So what is the story
with the murders?

17:06.092 --> 17:10.261
Thomas' daughter, Charlotte,
in 1858, falls in love

17:10.262 --> 17:14.464
with a tenant farmer next door,
Davillo Palmer.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.067
Well, there are two problems
with this relationship.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.271
One, Charlotte's mother
does not approve,

17:20.272 --> 17:23.741
and two,
Palmer is already married.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.076
What happens with Charlotte?

17:25.078 --> 17:29.213
Charlotte turns up pregnant,
and not long after that,

17:29.215 --> 17:33.083
Davillo Palmer's wife suddenly
and mysteriously, disappears.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.551
Pretty convenient.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.955
Some accounts say that there was
a child who also went missing

17:37.957 --> 17:39.890
at the same time
as the mother.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.660
Were they able
to pin this on Davillo?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.228
Surprisingly, no.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.696
Murder was suspected,

17:45.698 --> 17:49.033
but they could never pin
any charges on Davillo.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.573
There's a little girl
running around here.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.975
She's probably
5 or 6 years old.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.480
She got, like, a little dress on
and then an apron thing on.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.249
So I would say, like,
that was...

18:05.251 --> 18:08.586
like, 1870s or 1880s.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.590
Something happened to her
that wasn't good,

18:12.592 --> 18:16.260
and I feel like
whatever happened to her

18:16.262 --> 18:18.395
happened here.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.797
Like, I'm seeing...

18:19.799 --> 18:22.066
So she's outside
and it's sunny.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.701
It's getting dark.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.337
She knows the person...

18:26.339 --> 18:28.573
and then she's dead.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.709
All right, so Davillo's wife
and possible child

18:32.711 --> 18:35.046
are out of the picture.
What happens next?

18:35.048 --> 18:38.916
Charlotte and Davillo
wind up getting married,

18:38.918 --> 18:40.551
and 6 months later,

18:40.553 --> 18:44.221
Charlotte's mother dies
under mysterious circumstances.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.057
What is the cause of death?

18:46.059 --> 18:49.627
The autopsy shows that she died
of arsenic poisoning.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.063
I mean, they already
like Davillo with one homicide.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.564
Did they look at him
for this one?

18:53.566 --> 18:57.235
He was a person of interest
in his mother-in-law's death,

18:57.237 --> 18:59.837
but he disappeared before
he could be indicted.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.840
So, Walt, we got at least
two murders, maybe three,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.442
pretty close to
my client's property,

19:04.444 --> 19:07.044
and nobody served a day of time
for any of it.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.179
That's correct.

19:14.019 --> 19:16.186
The little girl,
she sees a monster.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.991
It looked like
when tar is bubbling,

19:19.993 --> 19:23.427
but make it big,
like a human being.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.396
And is that something
that the living

19:25.398 --> 19:27.465
are affected by anyway,
or is it just her?

19:27.467 --> 19:30.067
That thing is the culprit
of everything.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.139
It seems like this monster

19:35.141 --> 19:37.341
went dormant until now.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.078
It has to have the people
that are predispositioned

19:41.080 --> 19:43.180
to the violence and the anger.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.182
So those living people
who move here

19:45.184 --> 19:48.986
who have that predisposition
triggers everything.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.357
So I just got a call back
from a sergeant

19:53.359 --> 19:54.859
with the local
police department.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.095
He says he found something
I definitely need to know about.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.564
Apparently, a pregnant woman
was found murdered

20:00.566 --> 20:03.501
less than a mile
from Carrie and Chad's house,

20:03.503 --> 20:06.571
and this remains
an unsolved case to this day.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.572
Now he's going through
all the records for me,

20:08.574 --> 20:10.575
and he's going to tell me
exactly what happened.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.116
Well, Sergeant, I appreciate
you looking into this for me.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.052
The body that was found close
to my client's property,

20:21.054 --> 20:22.153
what can you tell me
about it?

20:22.155 --> 20:23.120
Her name was Hope Johnson.

20:23.122 --> 20:26.323
She went missing
on January 29, 1988.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.858
Okay. So this is
a pretty cold homicide.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.459
Correct.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.128
She's a pretty girl.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.596
All right. So what do we know
about this girl?

20:32.598 --> 20:33.998
At the time
of her disappearance,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.199
Hope Johnson
was 8 months pregnant

20:35.201 --> 20:36.567
and had a 4-year-old son.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.537
She was last seen by her
boyfriend January 29, 1988,

20:39.539 --> 20:42.072
and he reported her missing
to the police department

20:42.074 --> 20:43.908
on February 2, 1988.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.476
How long
before they find her?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.345
Roughly 6 weeks after
she was reported missing,

20:47.347 --> 20:48.746
she was found on March 12th.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.547
Her body was found
on the side of the road,

20:50.549 --> 20:52.949
roughly 1 mile
from the client's house.

20:52.951 --> 20:54.518
Was the boyfriend a suspect
at all?

20:54.520 --> 20:57.154
We were not able to develop him
as a suspect in this case.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.623
They questioned a lot
of people.
Yes.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.425
Okay, and nobody
ever got arrested?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.294
No.
No one was ever arrested.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.495
Now I know it's an open case,
and you can't tell me anything

21:05.497 --> 21:09.032
about the details
of her murder.
Right.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.234
But when I worked these cases
in the past,

21:11.236 --> 21:13.237
it's always been
somebody they knew

21:13.239 --> 21:15.439
and a lot of rage involved.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.641
I just hope you guys
get a break on it

21:16.643 --> 21:18.242
because this is
a pretty sad case.

21:18.244 --> 21:21.445
Yes, very sad.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.314
Is this living man
being influenced

21:24.316 --> 21:26.250
by this tar thing at all?

21:26.252 --> 21:27.985
Yes.

21:27.987 --> 21:31.655
This is a child murderer.

21:31.657 --> 21:35.259
I think that this person

21:35.261 --> 21:37.628
is completely insane

21:37.630 --> 21:42.600
and probably
just thrives off of...

21:42.602 --> 21:46.070
violence and, you know,
gets its kicks off of that

21:46.072 --> 21:48.406
and is still capable
of doing it.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.709
I think that it could
be satisfied

21:51.711 --> 21:54.211
with an adult
killing another adult.

21:54.213 --> 21:57.014
I think that it probably
prefers children.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.622

unexplained activity

and we'll help if we can.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.110
So far, I've got clients

22:26.112 --> 22:28.179
being physically attacked
on a property

22:28.181 --> 22:30.514
where a man was suspected
of murdering his wife,

22:30.516 --> 22:33.917
mother-in-law, and possibly
even his own child.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.053
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.589
Searching through old records,
I find an article about

22:38.591 --> 22:40.124
an auto plant
right down the street

22:40.126 --> 22:42.126
from Chad and Carrie's property.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.661
Turns out an employee
suffered a gruesome death

22:44.663 --> 22:45.830
while working there.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.032
I'm on my way to
the old Packard plant in Detroit

22:48.034 --> 22:50.167
to meet an autoworker
turned historian.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.403
Now he says he found a couple
of other deaths

22:52.405 --> 22:55.439
in the plants surrounding
Chad and Carrie's property.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.680
So, Gerry, that article
I found in my research,

23:03.682 --> 23:06.283
it sounds like this guy
died a pretty brutal death.

23:06.285 --> 23:07.585
What were we able to find out?

23:07.587 --> 23:10.287
That on October 3, 1963,

23:10.289 --> 23:12.356
a worker by the name
of Michael McDonough,

23:12.358 --> 23:13.724
who was 26 years old,

23:13.726 --> 23:16.927
died when a boom
struck him in the head.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.029
So, Gerry, let me ask you,
how far is this plant

23:19.031 --> 23:20.231
from my client's property?

23:20.233 --> 23:21.632
Less than a mile.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.366
Now does he die
right there on the spot?

23:23.368 --> 23:25.603
Normally,
in a General Motors factory,

23:25.605 --> 23:27.637
because of their insurance,

23:27.639 --> 23:30.307
that if you die
on the property,

23:30.309 --> 23:31.642
it's double a payout.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.578
So normally, most of them
that you will find,

23:34.580 --> 23:37.782
they're usually pronounced dead
in the hospital by a physician.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.449
Okay.

23:39.451 --> 23:40.918
There's no way this guy wasn't
dead when this thing hit him.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.452
Probably not.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.254
Now you mentioned on the phone
there was a couple other ones.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.522
What'd you find out?

23:45.524 --> 23:49.693
Found one in factory 31,
the axle plant, June 19th,

23:49.695 --> 23:51.929
and that was 1979.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.398
And this is a different plant
close to my client's property?

23:54.400 --> 23:59.269
Yes. John Holstein, who was
a 21-year-old worker.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.606
So a hydraulic line broke
and sprayed him down

24:02.608 --> 24:04.608
head to toe
with hydraulic fluid

24:04.610 --> 24:06.743
that was flammable
at that time,

24:06.745 --> 24:08.746
and a spark
from unknown origin

24:08.748 --> 24:11.848
is what turned him
into the human torch.

24:11.850 --> 24:14.418
And a witness to that,
it just so happens,

24:14.420 --> 24:15.619
was a friend of mine.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.622
And he seen him running
for quite some ways

24:18.624 --> 24:20.524
before he finally dropped.

24:20.526 --> 24:21.759
Did he die right away?

24:21.761 --> 24:24.561
He passed away 2 weeks later
in the hospital.

24:24.563 --> 24:27.631
Ouch. Now, Gerry, what else
were you able to find out?

24:27.633 --> 24:30.901
Another one at the Buick plant
in the body shop.

24:30.903 --> 24:34.572
It was on December 23, 1994.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.573
- It was Willy Anderson.
- Okay.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.042
And he was a die setter.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.978
He forgot to unhook a block --
80,000 pounds --

24:40.980 --> 24:43.380
and this die just
instantly crushed him

24:43.382 --> 24:47.251
between a guard rail
and the die.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.653
Before you became a historian,
you worked in this plant.

24:49.655 --> 24:50.988
Yeah.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.723
Were these accidents you just
described to me commonplace,

24:52.725 --> 24:55.526
or is it something that was,
you know, once in a blue moon?

24:55.528 --> 24:58.795
They were pretty commonplace,
and, at that time,

24:58.797 --> 25:00.998
speed was the name
of the game.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.267
We were trying to save
the Buick plant.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.068
And look where that got you.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.404
Yeah.
This is where we're at.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.878
I'm seeing a body on the floor.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.147
I think it's a man.

25:17.149 --> 25:20.650
I'm getting, like,
some chaos here.

25:20.652 --> 25:23.420
Like, I hear a woman crying.

25:23.422 --> 25:27.391
I'm hearing somebody
yelling for help.

25:27.393 --> 25:31.095
And I'm feeling, like,
a lot of people running around.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.864
Chaos.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.574
I saw several disturbing
things on my walk,

25:43.576 --> 25:47.912
but the violent dead man
had me very concerned.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.582
He did have a mustache.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.984
He had a thick, short neck.

26:00.459 --> 26:04.528
Next, I described the dead man
attacking a living person.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.397
He was showing me him, like,

26:07.399 --> 26:11.735
actually holding this person
above the stairs,

26:11.737 --> 26:14.271
and he was saying how

26:14.273 --> 26:17.274
he threw someone down there.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.143
I do believe it was a female,

26:19.145 --> 26:22.646
and that this person was
smaller than him.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.721
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:31.723 --> 26:33.424
Yes. that's what I saw.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.179
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:56.181 --> 26:58.281
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:58.283 --> 27:00.784
and our clients
for the first time.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.421
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Carrie and Chad.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.222
They live here,

27:06.224 --> 27:08.826
and they're raising these
four beautiful girls.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.161
This is Layla. She's 5.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.463
This is Tori, who is 10.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.797
This is Gabbie, who is 3.

27:13.799 --> 27:17.333
This is Ariana, who is 11.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.169
Now we're here, so obviously,

27:19.171 --> 27:21.338
you guys have a lot
of activity going on.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.673
But the big issue here is Chad.

27:23.675 --> 27:25.943
The whole family
is convinced he's changed

27:25.945 --> 27:27.677
since he moved in here,

27:27.679 --> 27:29.746
and if you can't help,

27:29.748 --> 27:31.615
they say it's going
to rip their family apart.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.149
With that being said,
I'm gonna ask Amy

27:33.151 --> 27:36.286
to tell us about her walk.

27:36.288 --> 27:41.691
When I first got here, I was
getting a lot of information.

27:41.693 --> 27:47.564
So I go upstairs,
and I saw two living females

27:47.566 --> 27:49.700
hiding behind a door.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.436
They were reacting
to a living male

27:52.438 --> 27:55.773
who was upset
and yelling and screaming.

27:55.775 --> 27:59.109
I felt such anger
from the living man.

27:59.111 --> 28:02.946
Like, he had murderous rage
coming out.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.983
This living male had
gone through a complete change,

28:05.985 --> 28:10.921
and I believe it's due
to an influence

28:10.923 --> 28:13.724
that's within this house.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.026
Wow. Carrie,
why don't you tell Amy

28:16.028 --> 28:17.795
how you feel Chad's changed?

28:17.797 --> 28:23.200
Before we moved in here, he used
to be a happy-go-lucky man.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.736
Now, he's very
just depressed and angry.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.672
So, Chad,
explain to Amy yourself

28:28.674 --> 28:30.140
how you feel you've changed.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.375
I don't know,

28:31.377 --> 28:36.379
but the range inside of me
comes over me heavy, fast.

28:36.381 --> 28:42.352
Sometimes, he just don't realize
that he is being very angry.

28:42.354 --> 28:46.156
It hurts me to hurt my family
in any direction.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.657
I'm seeing that you were

28:47.659 --> 28:49.359
in some dark situations
in the past,

28:49.361 --> 28:53.697
and that's making it easier for
what is here to influence you.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.499
My background ain't good.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.774
I saw an older man,

29:03.776 --> 29:07.978
and this older dead male
is extremely active.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.980
There's a lot of ways

29:09.982 --> 29:13.249
that living people
could experience him.

29:13.251 --> 29:18.722
I thought maybe you would see
him because he is very solid.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.990
Now, let's talk about
the tall shadow person

29:20.992 --> 29:23.126
that you mentioned to me.

29:23.128 --> 29:26.563
We will see him
shoot down the hallway.

29:26.565 --> 29:31.001
My children also see
this tall shadow man.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.237
He can also
be very physical.

29:33.239 --> 29:38.007
I had extreme neck
and head pain the entire time,

29:38.009 --> 29:40.210
and I saw him coming up

29:40.212 --> 29:43.313
and smacking people
on the back of the head.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.814
Carrie, do me a favor.

29:44.816 --> 29:47.451
Just tell her about how you were
getting grabbed in the shower.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.720
I have been grabbed
inappropriately in the shower.

29:50.722 --> 29:54.824
I've been grabbed in my bed.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.395
Now, Chad, you've been held down
in bed and choked, right?

29:58.397 --> 30:00.797
- Yeah.
- So tell Amy what happened.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.501
I couldn't move.
I was being held down.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.369
It was like being suffocated.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.840
Next thing I know, the bed is
in the middle of the room.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.341
Could that be this guy?

30:11.343 --> 30:14.311
Yeah. Definitely.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.846
There's nothing I can
do about it.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.781
That is what drives me
the most crazy.

30:17.783 --> 30:21.651
It angers me, and I've...
I feed off of it.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.388
I just want to get ahold of it.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.723
Can this guy do anything else?

30:26.725 --> 30:30.393
He can make you
really, really dizzy,

30:30.395 --> 30:32.996
and I just saw
people falling,

30:32.998 --> 30:36.466
and I also saw him
picking up a woman

30:36.468 --> 30:39.870
and throwing her down
the stairs.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.573
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.713
When you take a look at this,
you'll know you're not crazy.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.483
Wow.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.353
My god.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.488
That is just insane.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.225
Do me a favor and describe
to Amy what happened.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.627
I was coming down the stairs,

31:03.629 --> 31:07.230
and I felt just
this big blow to my back,

31:07.232 --> 31:09.766
and I went all the way
down the steps.

31:09.768 --> 31:13.169
I wish I could shoot
the son of a bitch.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.005
Did you get any sense
of who you think this guy was

31:15.007 --> 31:16.239
when he was alive?

31:16.241 --> 31:18.742
I got that he did, in fact,
live here.

31:18.744 --> 31:22.646
I was putting him in the '70s
or the '80s,

31:22.648 --> 31:26.083
maybe, you know,
the very start of the '90s.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.419
When he lived here,

31:29.421 --> 31:32.756
he experienced hauntings
as well.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.661
I had met a woman outside,

31:37.663 --> 31:43.333
and she said that he was
abusive towards her,

31:43.335 --> 31:45.935
and I felt like
that was his wife.

31:45.937 --> 31:49.606
The wife told me that
he had died somewhere else

31:49.608 --> 31:53.777
but had been sucked back
to this house.

31:53.779 --> 31:58.015
I know exactly
who she's talking about.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.749
Well, Amy, there's something
you should know.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.351
Chad's grandparents lived
in this house

32:01.353 --> 32:03.787
from the day it was built
in the early '60s...

32:05.090 --> 32:06.623
...until they gave it to Chad
a few years ago...

32:07.759 --> 32:09.826
...upon their passing.
Do me a favor.

32:09.828 --> 32:13.730
Why don't you describe
your grandfather to Amy for me?

32:13.732 --> 32:15.832
My grandpa was very old-school.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.534
He didn't like women.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.504
He didn't like my mom.
He didn't like my sister.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.906
He didn't like my grandmother.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.375
He was a very angry man.

32:25.377 --> 32:29.179
And I've been telling him
since day one that

32:29.181 --> 32:33.450
that angry man that I see
is his grandfather,

32:33.452 --> 32:38.187
and I knew that his grandfather
did not like women,

32:38.189 --> 32:39.655
and I felt
that he was the one

32:39.657 --> 32:41.992
that did not want me
in this home.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.795
Now I got a photo of him
when he was younger,

32:44.797 --> 32:48.631
and then I have another one here
as much older.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.371
Now you think his grandfather
is the guy you saw?

32:54.373 --> 32:56.105
I had a sketch done.

32:56.107 --> 32:58.942
You guys tell me.

33:00.679 --> 33:01.978
My heart's pounding.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.682
My.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.153
That looks like my pops.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.854
Not my dad, my pops.

33:11.856 --> 33:13.490
All right,
so let's get this cleared up.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.825
Who is that?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.693
Chad's grandfather's cousin.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.161
His grandfather's cousin. Okay.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.029
Now did he ever spend time
in this house?

33:20.031 --> 33:22.866
Yes, he did, off and on.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.434
Interesting.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.436
Now do you remember this guy
and what he was like?

33:26.438 --> 33:27.703
What kind of man he was?

33:27.705 --> 33:29.639
He was a violent man.
That's what I remember.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.908
And he was a violent man
up to his death.

33:31.910 --> 33:35.879
He was abused by his dad,
and my grandma brought him in.

33:35.881 --> 33:39.148
Took him in as a child.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.450
It looks just like him.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.054
Okay. Anything else?

33:45.056 --> 33:50.527
So I saw this dead little girl
playing in the backyard.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.830
I thought that maybe
you might see her

33:53.832 --> 33:56.266
'cause she is
very physical.

33:56.268 --> 34:00.804
So this child showed me
a location in the backyard

34:00.806 --> 34:03.440
where she had been murdered.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.576
This person who murdered her

34:06.578 --> 34:12.416
is, basically, everything
that's going on here.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.318
I got that she knew the person
who murdered her,

34:15.320 --> 34:17.453
and the thing about her

34:17.455 --> 34:21.792
is that she sees
this murderer as a monster.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.627
What I saw was
black skeleton arms

34:24.629 --> 34:27.797
and then, like,
a black, like, you know,

34:27.799 --> 34:30.766
the tar when you pour it,
and it's bubbly hot?

34:30.768 --> 34:32.936
So the body is like that.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.838
Because of how this
little kid was dressed,

34:34.840 --> 34:39.342
I put her
in the 1870s, 1880s.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.377
Not a ton to go on,
but there was a murder

34:41.379 --> 34:42.579
you described
sounds like something

34:42.581 --> 34:44.748
I came across in research.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.083
Now back in 1837, this rich guy
named Thomas Brandt

34:48.085 --> 34:52.989
bought 70,000 acres
of land in Flint.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.458
Your house sits
right in the middle of it.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.794
I got a photo of Brandt.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.797
This is guy who bought
the property originally.

35:00.799 --> 35:04.400
He had a daughter named
Charlotte, and she was in love

35:04.402 --> 35:06.402
with a tenant farmer
named Davillo Palmer

35:06.404 --> 35:09.406
who lived right next door
to your house.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.175
Charlotte's mother, Francisca,
didn't approve of this guy

35:12.177 --> 35:13.409
and, you know, for good reason.

35:13.411 --> 35:15.345
Guy was married.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.247
At some point,
Charlotte winds up

35:17.249 --> 35:19.382
getting pregnant
with Palmer's kid.

35:19.384 --> 35:22.218
Days later,
Palmer's wife goes missing.

35:22.220 --> 35:26.689
Now records were
pretty bad back then,

35:26.691 --> 35:29.559
but the historian I spoke to
said that they believe

35:29.561 --> 35:32.495
there was a child as well
that also went missing.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.231
- Wow.
- Damn.

35:35.233 --> 35:38.835
And this is, literally, right
next to where your house sits.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.103
Police flagged him
for the murders

35:40.105 --> 35:41.404
but couldn't make a case.

35:41.406 --> 35:44.174
So Palmer never went
to trial, nothing.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.509
So Palmer and Charlotte
get married,

35:46.511 --> 35:48.879
and they have a kid
4 months later.

35:48.881 --> 35:50.247
Now, it gets better.

35:50.249 --> 35:53.416
In 1859, Charlotte's mother,
Francisca, was murdered

35:53.418 --> 35:55.451
by being poisoned with arsenic.

35:55.453 --> 35:56.987
Now Palmer was a suspect,

35:56.989 --> 35:58.655
and before the cops
could even talk to him,

35:58.657 --> 36:01.291
he took off
and fell off the planet.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.660
Considering Palmer may
have killed his wife, his child,

36:03.662 --> 36:04.927
and his mother-in-law,

36:04.929 --> 36:08.731
and this all happened
in the 1850s,

36:08.733 --> 36:10.800
you think this is the person
who that could be?

36:10.802 --> 36:14.504
If, in fact, he did kill his
wife and kid,

36:14.506 --> 36:17.207
and then...yeah.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.942
Now you mentioned
this tar thing is everything.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.143
What do you mean by that?

36:20.145 --> 36:22.345
It used to be a human being,

36:22.347 --> 36:24.748
and it's been here
since it died.

36:24.750 --> 36:30.220
The thing about it is that
it'll lie dormant for years.

36:30.222 --> 36:36.259
Only when it sees somebody who
matches its same degree of anger

36:36.261 --> 36:38.295
and potential violence.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.162
That is what triggers it.

36:40.164 --> 36:43.700
And then
it can influence them.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.735
So it sounds like this tar thing

36:45.737 --> 36:49.105
is trying to use Chad here
to hurt other living people.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.910
Pisses me off so bad.
It pisses me off.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.913
So, Carrie, it sounds like
you were right.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.715
Something was influencing
your husband.

36:58.717 --> 37:03.453
I do feel relieved
knowing that.

37:03.455 --> 37:08.792
But it's just still hard to --
to cope with all of this.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.860
Now let me ask you a question
about this tar thing, though.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.328
<i>Why</i> is it going after Chad?

37:12.330 --> 37:14.864
I mean,
what's the purpose of it?

37:14.866 --> 37:17.467
This...person

37:17.469 --> 37:20.202
was a child murderer.

37:20.204 --> 37:23.806
He's insane,
potentially a serial killer.

37:23.808 --> 37:27.343
So obviously, he just wants
to continue doing the same

37:27.345 --> 37:29.345
and making violence happen,

37:29.347 --> 37:32.682
hoping for the end result
to be murder.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.484
If you kill
another adult, great.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.419
If you kill a kid,
even better.

37:38.556 --> 37:40.690
Could the things that are here
influence him enough

37:40.692 --> 37:41.725
to maybe hurt these kids?

37:41.727 --> 37:44.694
That's what
I'm worried about.

37:44.696 --> 37:49.231
I love my babies.
I'd die for my babies.

37:49.233 --> 37:52.435
I knew this was what it was.

37:52.437 --> 37:56.439
I knew, deep down,
he had bad attachments to him.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.808
And I keep telling him
and telling him,

37:58.810 --> 38:00.676
and he doesn't want
to believe me.

38:00.678 --> 38:04.514
I just didn't think
it was this...this bad.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.249
It makes me want to explode.

38:24.086 --> 38:25.952
Carrie, Chad,
I know this has been

38:25.954 --> 38:27.420
a rough night on both of you.

38:27.422 --> 38:28.822
But we know two things --

38:28.824 --> 38:33.560
you're not crazy, and you
called us in just in time.

38:33.562 --> 38:36.363
Now to answer
the big important question.

38:36.365 --> 38:40.100
Can you stay here
with your four daughters,

38:40.102 --> 38:42.469
and if you can,
what's it gonna take?

38:42.471 --> 38:44.570
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

38:48.810 --> 38:51.478
It's going to take
a little bit of work,

38:51.480 --> 38:54.481
but there is a way for you
to stay here safely.

38:54.483 --> 38:58.418
First, you need to find
a male medium

38:58.420 --> 39:00.686
who is tough,

39:00.688 --> 39:04.157
and that's because
this killer

39:04.159 --> 39:08.895
is a psychopathic,
tough male.

39:08.897 --> 39:12.364
He needs someone
that can match him

39:12.366 --> 39:15.068
in attitude and stance.

39:15.070 --> 39:18.471
You also need to find
a chaos magician,

39:18.473 --> 39:20.873
and that also needs
to be a male.

39:20.875 --> 39:23.075
These two males need
to come here.

39:23.077 --> 39:25.211
They need to go out
into the backyard,

39:25.213 --> 39:29.416
and the male medium will summon
the killer to come.

39:29.418 --> 39:31.818
He'll come with
the little girl.

39:31.820 --> 39:35.754
The chaos magician is going
to trap the killer

39:35.756 --> 39:40.226
and then send him
to the other side.

39:40.228 --> 39:43.163
The little girl is gonna
remain behind,

39:43.165 --> 39:47.367
and the male medium will
take care of moving her on.

39:47.369 --> 39:51.771
Then these two males are gonna
come inside the house

39:51.773 --> 39:53.573
and they're going to do
the same thing

39:53.575 --> 39:55.908
to take care of this guy.

39:55.910 --> 39:57.043
Pops.

39:57.045 --> 40:00.380
And this will take
probably about 24 hours

40:00.382 --> 40:03.316
for this whole process
to take place.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.117
So once that's done,

40:05.119 --> 40:08.321
those dead energies,
they'll be gone.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.991
But you'll still have
your attachments.

40:11.993 --> 40:16.930
A Reiki master needs
to come for four sessions.

40:16.932 --> 40:20.666
They will focus on getting
your personal living energy

40:20.668 --> 40:23.536
all aligned and clean.

40:23.538 --> 40:26.873
After that, you're going
to need to work on

40:26.875 --> 40:30.209
letting go psychologically
of your past.

40:30.211 --> 40:33.812
You need to go see
a psychotherapist.

40:33.814 --> 40:38.151
It's hard 'cause you are
going to relive

40:38.153 --> 40:41.888
the worst experiences
you've had in your life,

40:41.890 --> 40:47.059
but you're going to feel
so much lighter,

40:47.061 --> 40:51.631
and it's not going
to haunt you any more.

40:51.633 --> 40:55.234
You willing to do that?

40:55.236 --> 40:57.904
I'm going to do
whatever I got to do.

40:57.906 --> 41:01.641
Ready to do it.
Ready to get it done.

41:01.643 --> 41:03.943
I'm tired
of living like this.

41:03.945 --> 41:05.778
I'd rather have him back
to the way he was

41:05.780 --> 41:08.314
before we moved in here.

41:08.316 --> 41:10.983
Once they take these steps,
will things get better here?

41:10.985 --> 41:14.721
You're gonna feel
a <i> huge</i> difference,

41:14.723 --> 41:17.757
huge difference.
- It's a win-win situation.

41:17.759 --> 41:19.258
You'll get your husband back,

41:19.260 --> 41:21.327
and you get to keep the house
your grandparents left you.

41:21.329 --> 41:22.628
Right.

41:22.630 --> 41:25.932
I'm so amazed
by all this right now.

41:25.934 --> 41:27.867
It's overwhelming.

41:29.604 --> 41:31.337
I really hope
Chad and Carrie

41:31.339 --> 41:33.606
contact a medium
and a chaos magician

41:33.608 --> 41:37.009
to remove the dead
terrorizing their family.

41:37.011 --> 41:38.411
And with the help
of a therapist,

41:38.413 --> 41:41.147
Chad can free himself
of negative attachments,

41:41.149 --> 41:42.482
allowing this family to find

41:42.484 --> 41:44.217
the peace
it's been looking for.
