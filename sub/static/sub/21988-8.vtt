WEBVTT

00:05.073 --> 00:09.643
* Ah... ah...

00:09.677 --> 00:11.579
* Ah, ah

00:11.612 --> 00:15.716
* We are golden,
yes we are *

00:15.749 --> 00:19.587
* Hear the thunder,
see the stars *

00:19.620 --> 00:22.256
* We are golden
for all to see... *

00:22.290 --> 00:24.258
(song shuts off)

00:24.292 --> 00:26.294
(birds singing)

00:30.331 --> 00:32.133
Yeah.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.835
Amber, you are lost.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.370
Again.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.572
Nice one.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.308
MAN (whispering):
Help me...

00:42.676 --> 00:45.646
Hello?

00:49.483 --> 00:51.652
Help me...

00:54.122 --> 00:55.589
Is someone there?

00:56.624 --> 00:58.759
MAN:
Please, help me.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.731
Where are you? I can't see you.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.611
Hello?

01:17.645 --> 01:20.248
MAN (louder):
Please, help me.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.799
Help me, please.

01:41.769 --> 01:45.673
I'm gonna open
the door.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.846
(door creaking)

01:59.887 --> 02:02.823
*

02:32.220 --> 02:33.387
McGEE:
Can you deliver it the same day?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.456
It's kind of an emergency.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.458
Uh-oh. Whose birthday
did you miss?

02:37.491 --> 02:40.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa. $50 extra
for same-day delivery?

02:40.461 --> 02:41.895
Are you crazy?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.331
That's more than a birthday.
He's in trouble.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.432
All right.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.500
Just go ahead and do the same
day. Go ahead and do it.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.835
Yep. Big trouble.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.271
Yeah, I'll hold.
You have no idea.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.939
What, Delilah catch you
using cheat codes again,

02:51.972 --> 02:53.441
for Grand Theft Auto?

02:53.474 --> 02:54.808
No. Though
that was bad.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.744
No, Delilah and I got
in another fight last night

02:56.777 --> 02:59.447
about whether or not
to learn the baby's sex.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.781
I thought you couldn't find out.
Not from
the ultrasound.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.383
Doctor didn't want to risk

03:02.416 --> 03:05.253
heating up the shrapnel
in Delilah's spine.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.255
But he's ordered
a new, special blood test,

03:07.288 --> 03:09.423
and one of the things it can
detect is the baby's sex.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.691
Well, I'm on whatever side
Delilah is on,

03:10.724 --> 03:12.493
and I think you should be, too.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.594
What? Why?
Because she's doing

03:13.627 --> 03:15.329
all the heavy lifting, man.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.497
Well, I'm doing
some heavy lifting, too.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.232
Oh, really?
Like what?

03:18.266 --> 03:19.300
Well, for one thing,

03:19.333 --> 03:20.434
I loofah her feet.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.669
I don't complain
every time

03:21.702 --> 03:23.371
I got to pause Game of Thrones

03:23.404 --> 03:25.005
'cause every five minutes,
she's got to go pee.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.874
A gentleman. And a scholar.

03:26.907 --> 03:27.875
Look, I just
want to know

03:27.908 --> 03:29.009
the sex of my baby.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.411
Is that such a crime?

03:30.444 --> 03:31.745
You only have
a few weeks to go.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.247
I mean, what difference
does it make now?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.548
Well, for one thing,
if we knew the baby's sex,

03:34.582 --> 03:36.484
we'd only fight
over the name half as much.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.251
Hey, McGee?

03:37.285 --> 03:39.720
Same advice as before:
just submit.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.422
Hey, so what names

03:41.455 --> 03:42.456
do you have so far?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.392
Victor King.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.560
Oh, boss. Don't tell me
Delilah's sending you

03:46.594 --> 03:47.595
name ideas, too.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.763
Yeah. But that's
not one of them.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.299
Who is he?
Dead guy.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.966
Grabbing our gear.
GIBBS:
And call Ducky.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.569
He's off for the holidays.
Get him back to work.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.471
Hey, boss, I'm still on...

03:58.972 --> 04:01.442
...hold-- No.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.311
(camera shutter clicking)

04:03.344 --> 04:05.546
BISHOP:
So, according to the ranger,

04:05.579 --> 04:08.382
our victim was some
kind of businessman.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.850
So, not military?

04:09.883 --> 04:11.652
Why are we here?

04:11.685 --> 04:13.321
He was under investigation,
our Northeast field office.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.855
BISHOP: And then,
one day, he disappeared

04:14.888 --> 04:16.790
without a trace.
Nobody knows what happened.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.526
I guess we do now.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.394
Do we?

04:20.428 --> 04:23.631
What do you mean
by "a voice," exactly?

04:23.664 --> 04:25.699
How many times
do I have to explain it?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.735
You're sure that you heard
a voice from the shed?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.370
Where the dead body is.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.639
And no one else around
for miles.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.906
Look, I know
what it sounds like.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.008
This is a new one for me, too.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.811
But I'm just telling you
what happened.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.046
Okay. See, the thing is,
I can't tell this

04:39.079 --> 04:40.581
to my boss, Agent Gibbs.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.749
So you're gonna
have to explain it

04:41.782 --> 04:44.518
one more time. Okay?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.854
AMBER:
And then I opened the door,
and there he was.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.490
Like he is now.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.595
It's your turn to talk.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.531
Wow.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.932
Interesting.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.568
I'm so glad I have
a gun right now.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.370
You ever seen this guy before?
I don't think so.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.338
I mean, it's little hard
to tell with the maggots

05:04.372 --> 05:05.939
crawling out
of out his eyeballs.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.508
No.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.776
Never.
TORRES:
So, um...

05:08.809 --> 05:13.747
why would his, um... ghost

05:13.781 --> 05:16.016
be calling you
to help him, then?

05:16.049 --> 05:18.619
Oh, please.
Oh, what-- you have
a better explanation?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.687
You're gonna find one.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.021
Maybe there's a hidden speaker.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.456
No speaker.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.457
Duck?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.493
Well, hearing voices
is a common

05:25.526 --> 05:28.996
auditory hallucination...

05:29.029 --> 05:30.631
which may
or may not be

05:30.664 --> 05:32.633
associated with
a mental health problem.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.001
TORRES:
Well, that body is not

05:34.034 --> 05:35.369
a hallucination.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.604
Something
led her to it.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.706
GIBBS: Torres, enough.
TORRES: What? I-I...

05:38.739 --> 05:40.007
I've seen a lot stranger
things in this world

05:40.040 --> 05:42.075
than-than a dead man...
AMBER:
Shh.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.550
Tell me you didn't
just hear that.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.018
Um...

05:51.051 --> 05:52.553
Hear what?

05:52.586 --> 05:53.587
AMBER:
Him.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.891
H-He's still talking.

05:57.925 --> 05:58.926
He says he's cold.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.103
McGEE:
Victor King, 55.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.740
Owned a large,
multinational steel company

06:12.773 --> 06:14.575
and was a prominent
Navy supplier.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.744
Was also a golfer,
an avid hiker...

06:16.777 --> 06:18.446
And had been under investigation
by the DoD

06:18.479 --> 06:20.113
for the last two years.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.783
Fraud, bribery,
selling defective materials.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.552
Real class act.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.454
Why was this guy
still walking around?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.155
His lawyers were always
one step ahead.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.957
Feds could never
make anything stick.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.092
Then, in February,
King disappeared.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.794
Nobody could find him.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.729
Until she came along.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.131
McGEE:
Amber Davis. A network
software engineer.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.434
Just moved to Virginia.
Where was she
when our victim died?

06:40.468 --> 06:42.570
Well, if we go by Ducky's
preliminary time of death

06:42.603 --> 06:45.773
of February, she was in Uganda,
setting up a computer network

06:45.806 --> 06:47.074
for a relief charity.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.009
McGEE: So whatever
happened to King,

06:49.042 --> 06:51.111
Amber wasn't even
in the country for it.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.180
Um, are we gonna talk
about what she heard

06:53.213 --> 06:54.682
when we were standing there?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.049
No.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.651
I definitely did not
hear anything.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.586
King said he was cold.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.587
Oh, he did, now?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.854
Okay, McGee, I get it.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.723
You're not a Belieber. I get it.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.824
Bishop?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.759
You all heard me
say "no," right?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.127
BISHOP: I do
believe in ghosts.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.863
But actually
talking to them?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.064
The jury's still out.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.666
McGEE:
Wait, what jury?

07:12.700 --> 07:15.569
There's absolutely no evidence
that ESP exists.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.071
Not yet. But there could be some
kind of principle of science

07:18.105 --> 07:19.507
that hasn't been discovered.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.208
Enough with the voodoo!

07:21.241 --> 07:23.744
We focus on what we can
prove, what we know.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.012
That's it.
TORRES:
Well, right now,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.047
we don't know anything,
and if Amber is getting messages

07:27.080 --> 07:28.882
from this dead guy...

07:28.916 --> 07:32.119
Then, maybe she can help
find out what happened to him.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.120
Oh, yeah?
I'm just saying,
it might

07:33.153 --> 07:34.955
be worth talking
to Amber again.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.690
You never know
what somebody knows.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.925
Jack, knock yourself out.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.627
I will, Gibbs.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.194
AMBER:
I already told

07:41.228 --> 07:43.564
those other agents
what happened.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.133
And with the exception of
the-the cutie with the accent...
Mm-hmm.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.201
I don't think
they believed me.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.103
I get the sense even
you don't believe you.

07:50.137 --> 07:54.141
Well, I'm a computer scientist,
not a tarot card reader.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.176
Please.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.116
I might be able
to help you with that.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.953
Have a seat.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.187
Let's see.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.791
Did you ever call
a friend on the phone

08:10.824 --> 08:13.727
and they say,
"Yo, babe,

08:13.761 --> 08:16.129
what up? I was just
about to call you"?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.999
Yeah. It's called a coincidence.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.735
Sometimes. And sometimes,

08:21.769 --> 08:24.171
it's because you both heard
the same song on the radio,

08:24.204 --> 08:25.973
and it reminded you
of each other.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.810
See, the-the brain
is an amazing thing,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.813
capable of making connections
that are so incredible,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.815
sometimes it can
seem like you're...

08:34.848 --> 08:36.316
Like you're psychic?
Bingo.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.152
Sometimes the connections
are subconscious,

08:39.186 --> 08:41.154
like that gut feeling
that you get.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.223
But in some people,
they manifest

08:43.256 --> 08:44.592
as an inner voice.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.094
Yeah, this was no
inner voice I heard.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.128
I believe

08:48.161 --> 08:50.330
that your subconscious mind

08:50.363 --> 08:53.867
picked up various clues
about where King's body was.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.904
Perhaps a chance encounter
with the murderer himself.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.907
And then my brain
synthesized those clues,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.842
and led me to the shed.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.143
Exactly.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.613
(laughing):
Okay.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.247
Okay, so what now?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.617
Now we try to figure out
where those clues came from.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.919
And see if they can lead us
back to the murderer.

09:11.952 --> 09:12.853
Right.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.321
All right.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.756
I'm in.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.224
Good. So...

09:17.257 --> 09:20.327
Let's start with
a regular day for you.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.162
You married?
Divorced.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.697
Kids?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.069
I had a daughter.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.706
She died last year.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.307
In her sleep. It was her heart.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.310
I'm very sorry to hear that.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.879
So am I.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.648
Ended my marriage.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.883
I think.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.286
To be honest, I'm-I'm not
really sure what happened.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.254
Hmm.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.956
The worst part is,

09:48.989 --> 09:53.593
every time I even picture
her face, I see...

09:56.864 --> 09:58.999
...Victor King.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.302
He's fighting with someone.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.138
Amber?

10:05.172 --> 10:06.874
Uh...

10:06.907 --> 10:08.341
Amber, can you hear me?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.379
A man in a car.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.015
Amber, can you see
who's in the car?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.984
Amber, d-do you know
where it is?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.218
Where's the car?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.920
West Bay.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.922
West Bay. West Bay.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.725
He had an accident.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.760
JIMMY:
How about this Amber?

10:26.794 --> 10:29.229
I-I mean, can people
really talk to the dead?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.898
You are seriously
asking me that?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.099
(both laugh)

10:32.132 --> 10:33.767
The real question is...

10:33.801 --> 10:35.335
Can they talk back?
And the answer is...

10:35.368 --> 10:37.838
No.
Oh, I disagree, Jethro.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.208
This man had a lot to tell us,
starting with how he died.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.910
Hypothermia!

10:42.943 --> 10:44.812
Have a little respect, Doctor.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.681
Sorry, Doctor.
It's just that I've never seen

10:47.715 --> 10:50.050
such well-formed
Wischnewski spots before.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.419
Hey, you sure about that?
Oh, trust me, Gibbs, these are

10:52.452 --> 10:53.787
really great Wischnewski spots.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.155
Hypothermia.
DUCKY: Yes.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.024
He shows all the classic signs.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.826
Point to Amber. She did say

10:58.859 --> 11:00.360
that King told her
that he was cold.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.997
Judging by the pattern
of the frostbite,

11:04.031 --> 11:08.836
I'd say this man became lost
when hiking and froze to death.

11:08.869 --> 11:12.339
Which, incidentally, makes this
an accident, not a murder.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.844
I take it you do not concur?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.211
Guy was
an experienced hiker, Doc.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.013
He gets lost in a state park?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.849
Maybe we should
talk to Amber again.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.884
I mean, she might be able to...
Hey, enough.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.886
We're done with
the hearing voices.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.686
Actually, we're not.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.388
I just got back
from the Pentagon.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.024
DoD wants this solved ASAP.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.860
King was a thorn
in their side,

11:32.893 --> 11:35.028
and they want it pulled
before this case gets cold.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.864
We're working on it.
Well, you should
work on it with Amber.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.365
I want you to use her
as a source.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.399
Ah, come on, Leon.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.901
Gibbs, I know how you feel,

11:40.934 --> 11:43.370
but NCIS has worked
with psychics before.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.038
So have I, in fact.
Yeah?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.239
How'd that work out?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.508
The sky didn't fall,
let's put it that way.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.044
Look, we have questions,
Amber might have answers.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.346
Don't waste a possible asset.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.048
And that's an order.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.193
You know, Amber and
Agent Sloane are...

12:06.226 --> 12:08.962
taking quite a...
quite a while up there.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.798
Yeah. It's called
an interview.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.834
Keep telling you guys,
you keep messing with the dead,

12:13.867 --> 12:14.968
that's bad juju.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.136
If they don't come down soon,

12:16.169 --> 12:18.038
you're gonna go up there
and get them.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.306
They're fine.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.141
Sloane just sent me an e-mail
ten minutes ago.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.010
She has a lead
on a murder suspect,

12:23.043 --> 12:24.812
and I've been trying
to track it down.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.813
What's she got?

12:25.846 --> 12:26.847
BISHOP:
Make and color of a car,

12:26.880 --> 12:27.981
somewhere by West Bay.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.349
That's not a lot to go on.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.019
West Bay--
is that a town, a street?

12:32.052 --> 12:34.054
BISHOP: Pulling up a list
of all vehicles

12:34.087 --> 12:35.455
matching that make and color.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.192
All right, 62 hits,
but none registered in West Bay.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.460
West Bay.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.095
What if it's not a place?

12:45.332 --> 12:47.000
BISHOP:
Thomas Westbay.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.035
Pulling up his record.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.536
It says he works for OSHA.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.140
That was fast.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.075
Is that the guy
you saw?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.077
AMBER:
Yeah.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.946
That's him.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.048
Looks like the
chat went well.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.550
I need to go talk
to a colleague.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.952
And an electrician.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.419
GIBBS:
What do we got?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.420
Murder suspect.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.089
Uh, actually, hang on.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.291
Thomas Westbay
can't be our murderer.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.394
He died in a car accident

13:14.427 --> 13:17.097
two days before
King disappeared.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.069
That was no accident.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.337
How do you know that?

13:24.371 --> 13:27.975
I just know.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.012
Good luck with that.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.896
(sighs) Abby, I need
some inspiration.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.363
Hey.

13:50.397 --> 13:54.367
Well, I can offer you
a grease-covered BLT.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.870
And that's not bacon grease.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.305
Mm, I'll pass.
What's up?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.439
I'm trying to find
a connection between

13:59.472 --> 14:01.441
this Westbay guy
and our victim.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.243
Credit cards
were a bust.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.246
I've got DoD unloading reports
on their investigation.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.881
Hoping it jogs something loose.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.550
Well, let the jogging begin.
(chuckles)

14:10.583 --> 14:12.119
(clears throat)

14:12.152 --> 14:13.553
Uh, Jimmy Lancaster, DoD,

14:13.586 --> 14:16.256
with the files
on the King investigation,

14:16.289 --> 14:18.358
aka The Man We Could
Never Catch.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.393
Well, luckily we have
a secret weapon.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.528
Yeah, I heard you guys

14:21.561 --> 14:22.930
are working with a psychic.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.597
Network engineer.
Oh.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.100
Hey, uh, I lost
my wedding ring last week.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.302
Any chance I could
talk to her before my wife...

14:29.336 --> 14:31.038
No. Bye.
Oh.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.605
Thank you.
Yep.

14:32.639 --> 14:37.410
McGee, I had no idea you were
so closed-minded about this.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.412
Look, just because I don't
think that ghosts are...

14:39.446 --> 14:41.581
Danger, Will Robinson.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.549
You are speaking
to someone

14:42.582 --> 14:45.418
who believes in God,

14:45.452 --> 14:47.654
and believes in
the immortal soul,

14:47.687 --> 14:50.390
and whose third favorite movie
is Ghost.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.159
Okay, then show me the money.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.127
Amber says this wasn't
an accident.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.996
Police say it was.
They wrong?

14:56.029 --> 14:58.031
The police concluded
that Westbay

14:58.065 --> 15:00.533
fell asleep when he was driving,

15:00.567 --> 15:03.370
citing the lack of intoxication
and the clear weather...

15:03.403 --> 15:05.405
And the fact that he never
hit the brakes before crashing.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.340
Except I think he did.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.543
He pushed down so hard

15:10.577 --> 15:13.580
that his shoe left an imprint
on the brake pedal.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.982
Yeah, but there'd be skid marks.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.716
Not if the brakes were out.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.219
Box Guy, can you just
stick to the boxes, please?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.021
Thank you.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.356
The police report
said that

15:23.390 --> 15:25.192
the brakes were in
perfect working order.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.194
And they are, now.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.563
But I just don't think they
were when Westbay crashed.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.332
Well, what are you saying?
You're saying that

15:32.365 --> 15:34.567
somebody rigged his brakes
to fail?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.336
Yeah, and then they magically
fixed themselves

15:36.369 --> 15:38.405
before the cops showed up.
I know.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.374
It sounds like crazy talk,
but this is a crazy world.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.676
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.178
These are Westbay's
credit card charges.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.147
There's a bunch
from the same mechanic.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.415
Every three weeks
like clockwork.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.716
This car is new.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.685
There's no reason for him to be
seeing a mechanic that often.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.188
I think it's time you went
and talked to that mechanic.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.358
And... Amber was right.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.626
This...

16:00.793 --> 16:02.162
...was no accident.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.431
TORRES:
All right, and then after that,

16:04.464 --> 16:05.999
you replaced
Westbay's muffler.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.001
Three weeks after that,
his windshield.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.538
Three weeks after that, the
tires, et cetera, et cetera.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.642
Hey, tell me, you ever work on
Westbay's brakes, by any chance?

16:15.675 --> 16:17.644
Maybe.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.180
I'm a mechanic.
I do mechanical things.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.783
Well, it says here that you do
a lot more than that.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.618
Arrests for check
fraud, bank fraud...

16:25.652 --> 16:27.520
I did my time.
You got a point?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.323
What I got is two murder victims

16:30.357 --> 16:33.493
and a feeling you had something
to do with at least one of them.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.794
Whoa, slow down.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.629
I ain't got nothing
to do with any of that.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.365
But you know something.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.702
We can just call your
parole officer and talk to her.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.405
You make that call,

16:45.438 --> 16:47.707
I'm back in the big house,
just because.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.776
All right, well, then give me
a reason not to make it.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.778
(chuckles)

16:51.811 --> 16:56.783
Look, I-I didn't actually
touch Westbay's car, okay?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.318
So these invoices are fake?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.719
Look,

16:59.752 --> 17:01.321
Westbay was a client of

17:01.354 --> 17:03.656
a side business I had going on.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.725
He had some government job.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.694
Yeah, building inspector, OSHA.
Whatever.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.329
But he was on the take.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.164
Took bribes
to look the other way.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.600
Every few weeks,
he'd bring me the cash,

17:13.633 --> 17:16.336
and I'd deliver it to a guy
to launder it for him.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.271
Those fake invoices,

17:18.305 --> 17:21.174
uh, covered my fee.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.743
Now, as far as his accident,

17:23.776 --> 17:27.280
if that wasn't an accident,
that's news to me.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.082
Interesting.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.718
So we have
a dirty OSHA inspector,

17:31.751 --> 17:34.287
a dirty steel magnate...

17:34.321 --> 17:36.689
What's the connection?
Aside from dirt.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.360
Working on it.
With Amber?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.595
I-I'm really right
there with you.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.664
I totally understand
your ambivalence.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.099
I'm not ambivalent.
I'm not saying at all

17:46.133 --> 17:47.700
that she can talk to the dead,
believe me.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.568
She can't.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.770
If you could've seen
her in my office,

17:50.803 --> 17:52.539
there is something up
with this chick.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.741
I-I don't know what it is,
but it made my skin crawl.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.844
Just give her
another chance.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.301
(knock on door)

18:29.942 --> 18:32.779
Hi.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.888
Um...

18:41.921 --> 18:44.257
so y-you said you wanted
to talk about the case?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.228
Yep.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.232
Thanks.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.770
Wouldn't that involve,
you know,

18:57.804 --> 19:00.173
actually talking?

19:00.207 --> 19:02.742
You don't know
what I'm gonna say?

19:02.775 --> 19:05.845
Well, it doesn't take a psychic
to guess.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.714
You think
I'm full of it.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.883
Yeah. I don't blame you.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.885
And yet
how do you explain

19:12.919 --> 19:14.321
the voices I heard?

19:14.354 --> 19:15.555
The visions?

19:15.588 --> 19:16.923
How do you explain it?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.725
Well, how do you explain
this gut instinct of yours

19:18.758 --> 19:20.393
your agents keep talking about?
I don't.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.195
It is what it is.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.765
Then can't I just be what I am?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.400
Whatever I am?

19:41.648 --> 19:42.915
What's this?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.786
Gas cap.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.221
Out of Westbay's car.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.556
Oh, yeah?

19:49.589 --> 19:51.591
And what am I
supposed to do with it?

19:56.929 --> 19:59.266
Nothing, I guess.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.601
Wait.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.339
I need a pen.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.616
BISHOP:
You got Amber's map?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.818
Yeah. We are
going that way.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.254
Not that we know what
we're looking for.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.256
No. Neither does Amber.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.926
All she said was something
was buried out here.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.828
Something to do
with the case.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.897
Excuse me while I vomit
in my mouth.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.900
Do you know that 73%
of the public

20:33.933 --> 20:35.935
believe in the paranormal?

20:35.968 --> 20:37.904
They all wrong?
They were wrong about Titanic.

20:37.937 --> 20:41.040
Ah. So a skeptic
and a cynic.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.343
No, a realist.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.911
Look, believe me, I would love

20:44.944 --> 20:46.946
for Amber to be
the real deal, okay?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.848
Maybe she could tell me
what kind of baby I'm having.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.650
Probably a cute one.
Delilah had

20:50.683 --> 20:52.018
that new blood test
this morning.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.686
Put the doctor
under strict orders

20:53.720 --> 20:55.588
not to tell me
the sex of the baby.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.924
Mm.
So I'm kind of
out of options.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.994
Unless you...
hack the doctor's computer,

21:02.028 --> 21:04.531
take a peek
at the results yourself.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.833
McGee, don't even
think about it.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.068
Aside from being illegal,
it is illegal.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.070
And... Delilah
would kill you

21:11.103 --> 21:12.905
if she found out.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.907
Ah, good point.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.676
Ah...

21:16.709 --> 21:17.944
Whoa!

21:17.977 --> 21:19.078
You okay? What happened?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.448
Ow.
(coughs)

21:21.481 --> 21:24.384
Some kind of depression
in the ground.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.052
(groans)

21:27.454 --> 21:28.955
(metallic clack, scrape)

21:31.924 --> 21:34.527
Right where Amber
said it would be.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.429
All right,
let's open it.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.872
TORRES:
Hey, Abbs. Just came to see

21:45.905 --> 21:47.974
what our treasure looks
like. Anything good?

21:48.007 --> 21:48.775
Oh, it's beyond good.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.043
This is, like,
murder weapon-palooza.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.680
(chuckles): It looks like McGee
went shopping at Sharper Image.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.648
Oh, you can't buy this
at Sharper Image.

21:55.682 --> 21:59.118
What is that?
That is a custom-made OBD drive,

21:59.151 --> 22:01.821
which stands for
On-Board Diagnostics.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.790
It's a computer port
for your car

22:03.823 --> 22:06.025
that's used to troubleshoot
mechanical problems.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.561
Only this puppy
was specifically made

22:08.595 --> 22:10.029
to cause problems.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.032
No offense to puppies.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.468
When the drive was plugged
into Westbay's car,

22:15.502 --> 22:19.038
it programmed the computer to
disable the brakes temporarily,

22:19.071 --> 22:20.873
and then re-enable them

22:20.907 --> 22:23.042
before the crash scene
investigators could notice.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.378
Wait, so Amber was right--
no accident.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.913
No. I mean, that we knew.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.681
But the news of the day

22:28.715 --> 22:32.051
is that neither was Victor King
getting lost in the woods.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.486
This is

22:33.520 --> 22:36.756
an ES6 GPS hiker's watch.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.024
It's registered
to King.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.026
Someone hacked into it remotely

22:40.059 --> 22:42.695
and messed with the GPS,
so when King thought

22:42.729 --> 22:45.498
that the watch was guiding him
back to his car...

22:45.532 --> 22:47.800
It was leading him deeper
and deeper into the forest.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.035
And he froze to death.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.970
Yeah. It was a...

22:51.003 --> 22:53.072
"perfect murder"... ish.

22:53.105 --> 22:56.142
Except the killer
didn't count on having
a psychic on his tail.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.611
Otherwise, he probably
would have wiped

22:58.645 --> 23:01.414
his fingerprints off
the murder weapons.
You got prints?

23:01.448 --> 23:03.049
I'm running them now.
Wow.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.584
Amber's two for two.
Yeah.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.852
Didn't see that coming.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.022
I got a match
on the killer's prints.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.728
What is Amber's picture doing
on that screen?

23:16.796 --> 23:18.798
Amber is the killer.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.113
SLOANE:
Right under our noses

23:34.146 --> 23:35.047
(door opens)
all this time.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.617
The upside was seeing McGee
tell Torres,

23:37.650 --> 23:40.553
(singsongy):
"I told you so."

23:40.587 --> 23:42.789
I never heard
an adult

23:42.822 --> 23:45.024
use that phrase with such glee.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.760
Have I missed much?
I'm curious to see

23:47.794 --> 23:51.097
the interrogation of a liar
as skillful as this one.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.633
We're just
getting started.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.134
(door opens)

23:55.167 --> 23:56.603
(door closes)

23:56.636 --> 23:57.837
(door opens)

23:57.870 --> 23:59.739
Agent Gibbs,
wh-what is going on?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.874
Why am I in this room?

24:03.743 --> 24:05.845
(sighs)

24:09.682 --> 24:11.217
Am I supposed to know
what those are?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.685
We're done with the games.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.687
I don't know
what that means.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.557
It means we know you
killed Victor King

24:17.590 --> 24:19.759
and Thomas Westbay.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.830
Excuse me?

24:23.863 --> 24:25.898
It means you're
not a psychic.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.701
It means you don't
hear dead people.

24:28.735 --> 24:31.538
And you knew where King's body
was because you put it there.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.239
O-Oh, yeah?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.707
When?

24:34.741 --> 24:36.543
When I was...

24:36.576 --> 24:39.746
building an entire
Wide Area Network from scratch

24:39.779 --> 24:42.582
6,000 miles away in Uganda?

24:42.615 --> 24:43.783
No. After.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.853
You flew in on a
fake passport...

24:46.886 --> 24:50.523
and facial recognition
found you in Customs.

24:50.557 --> 24:53.292
You doctored that.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.995
She really is quite convincing.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.132
This isn't possible.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.971
I-I mean, I'm the one
who led you to that box

25:05.004 --> 25:07.239
in the first place,
after you...

25:07.273 --> 25:09.642
gave me
the victim's gas cap.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.211
You mean this?

25:16.849 --> 25:19.018
That's my gas cap.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.290
I didn't kill them.
You have the skills,

25:24.323 --> 25:27.259
It wasn't me.
the opportunity--
the only thing

25:27.293 --> 25:29.662
we don't have
is the motive.
Look, why?

25:32.064 --> 25:33.866
Nobody's this good.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.671
(whispers):
What is happening?

25:44.644 --> 25:45.778
Tell us why.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.280
Then we can talk.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.783
Agent Gibbs...

25:50.817 --> 25:53.052
can I trust you?

25:53.085 --> 25:55.722
(sniffles)

25:55.755 --> 25:58.090
I didn't kill those men.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.026
(sniffles)
I wouldn't...

26:00.059 --> 26:02.094
kill those men.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.664
But I'm not blind.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.269
A-And I don't...

26:10.302 --> 26:13.339
know how to explain any of it.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.376
But if you can promise me

26:17.409 --> 26:20.747
that you won't railroad
an innocent person,

26:20.780 --> 26:23.983
then I can promise you that...

26:24.016 --> 26:28.955
I will help you figure out
what is going on.

26:30.857 --> 26:34.093
I'll help you find justice...

26:36.328 --> 26:40.032
...if you can promise me
the same thing.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.036
Deal?

26:50.409 --> 26:52.078
Whew. That's a new one.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.413
I'm open to
suggestions here.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.916
I think the first question
is whether we all believe

26:56.949 --> 26:59.151
that she's as clueless
as she claims.

26:59.185 --> 27:02.989
So, some kind
of disassociative disorder?

27:03.022 --> 27:05.357
Combined with
a fugue state, perhaps.

27:05.391 --> 27:08.861
Or psychogenic amnesia.
English.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.063
It is possible she
committed these murders

27:11.097 --> 27:13.065
and then repressed
the memories of them.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.101
Right. And now they're
bubbling to the surface

27:15.134 --> 27:17.937
in the form of these voices
that she keeps hearing.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.339
Her conscience, as it were,
calling out to her,

27:20.372 --> 27:23.342
triggered by all the evidence
you keep presenting.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.944
Although...

27:24.977 --> 27:27.046
repressed memories
are usually the result

27:27.079 --> 27:28.881
of some sort of trauma.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.817
She did lose a
daughter recently.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.885
Nothing is more
traumatic than that.

27:32.919 --> 27:33.986
How did she die?

27:34.020 --> 27:35.822
In her sleep. Bad heart.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.056
According to Amber.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.191
Well, perhaps it's time

27:39.225 --> 27:41.994
for you to start digging
a little deeper.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.963
MAN:
Murder?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.097
M-My ex-wife?

27:45.131 --> 27:46.866
No, there has to be
some mistake.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.034
There isn't.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.902
Who did she kill?

27:49.936 --> 27:51.738
Why?
Well, that is what

27:51.771 --> 27:53.740
we're trying to figure out.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.742
Do you know them?

27:58.110 --> 27:59.345
No.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.849
Wait, where is she?
Does she need money for bail?

28:02.882 --> 28:04.917
I have a house--
I can put that up if I need do.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.285
We're transferring her
to a psych hospital.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.453
You can see her there.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.755
When?
You know,

28:08.788 --> 28:10.456
I have to tell you,
my ex wouldn't be

28:10.489 --> 28:13.392
this supportive of me
if I was accused of shoplifting,

28:13.425 --> 28:15.161
much less... murder.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.996
Well, I didn't want
the divorce.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.465
But, uh,
after our daughter died...

28:19.498 --> 28:22.935
it was a hard time for me.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.037
Yeah. For both
of you, I'm sure.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.973
You'd think.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.475
When our little girl died,
it nearly destroyed us,

28:29.508 --> 28:32.044
and then... Amber moved on.

28:33.279 --> 28:36.415
I tried. I...
I really, really tried,

28:36.448 --> 28:38.985
but I couldn't.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.754
And I couldn't stand to be
in the same room

28:41.788 --> 28:45.391
with someone who wasn't
in as much pain as I was.

28:45.424 --> 28:49.128
It's your daughter I actually
wanted to ask you about.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.330
I... I know it's hard,

28:51.363 --> 28:54.000
but can you tell me
what happened?

28:54.033 --> 28:57.169
Did you know about her heart
defect before it killed her?

28:57.203 --> 28:59.806
(stammers):
She had a murmur, yeah,

28:59.839 --> 29:01.440
but that wasn't what killed her.

29:03.009 --> 29:06.745
She died when a floor collapsed
during a birthday party.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.349
Who told you it was her heart?

29:10.382 --> 29:11.818
McGEE:
This collapse is

29:11.851 --> 29:13.953
the missing link
between our two victims.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.021
And Westbay was

29:15.054 --> 29:16.188
the lead OSHA
investigator.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.157
Victor King supplied
the steel rebar

29:18.190 --> 29:19.358
that buckled.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.360
But Westbay's final
report cleared

29:21.393 --> 29:22.962
King's company
of all wrongdoing.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.131
Dodged a bullet again.
And with a little
help, I bet.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.166
Westbay had a history
of taking bribes.
And King had

29:27.199 --> 29:29.135
a history of making them--
now, I'm not really great

29:29.168 --> 29:31.070
at math, but I
can do it here.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.105
King's crappy steel killed
Amber's daughter,

29:33.139 --> 29:35.041
and Westbay covered it up.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.976
Amber still here?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.277
Uh, psych hospital

29:38.310 --> 29:40.546
says they are not coming
for another 20 minutes.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.348
Well, I think we
found our motive.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.383
(sighs):
Well, who could blame her?

29:44.416 --> 29:47.386
I mean, I don't know what I'd do
if somebody killed my daughter.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.088
Or whatever I'm having.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.891
Oh, yeah, speaking of that,
Bishop told me

29:51.924 --> 29:54.393
you were thinking about hacking
your doctor's office.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.128
I just think that's...

29:56.162 --> 29:57.830
I know. I know. It's-it's crazy.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.165
No, I was gonna say genius.

29:59.198 --> 30:02.034
It's also illegal.
Yeah.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.005
You know what?
Since you're a fan of the idea,

30:06.038 --> 30:07.573
just out of curiosity,

30:07.606 --> 30:09.041
I want to see how secure

30:09.075 --> 30:11.043
our doctor's system is.

30:11.077 --> 30:13.045
I mean, it's not like
you're hacking anyone.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.114
Right, right, right. It's just
a good thing to know these days.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.116
I totally get it.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

30:21.253 --> 30:22.955
Someone put up a firewall

30:22.989 --> 30:24.924
between the doctor's IP
address and my work computer.

30:27.126 --> 30:30.062
The only person
that knows both IPs is Delilah.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.064
Oh, snap.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.600
I'm a dead man.

30:34.633 --> 30:38.204
AMBER:
Uh, I don't understand.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.139
What is this?

30:40.172 --> 30:42.008
The accident
that killed your daughter.

30:43.976 --> 30:47.346
No, I... I told you,
my daughter died in her sleep.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.353
No, we're not doing this.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.423
Amber, listen to me...
I don't know

30:57.456 --> 31:00.192
what you're up to, uh,

31:00.226 --> 31:02.628
but my daughter...

31:02.661 --> 31:05.164
died in her sleep.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.198
That's not what the report says.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.666
Peacefully.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.003
In... her sleep.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.139
Hey, I know this is really hard.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.974
No, please, stop.

31:15.007 --> 31:16.442
Stop.
Amber, we spoke

31:16.475 --> 31:18.144
to your ex-husband.
No.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.112
He told us what happened.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.414
(yelling):
No!

31:26.218 --> 31:28.988
Those scumbags.

31:29.021 --> 31:33.960
They got what they deserved.

31:35.527 --> 31:39.331
They killed my daughter.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.970
They killed her,

31:44.003 --> 31:48.507
and they tried
to cover it up.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.113
No.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.315
No, thank you.

31:56.348 --> 32:00.319
No... freaking...

32:00.352 --> 32:02.121
thank you.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.494
BISHOP:
Amber refused to accept

32:08.527 --> 32:11.163
the building collapse
was an accident.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.265
So she started digging
and learned that King

32:13.299 --> 32:14.666
was under investigation.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.602
Eventually, she
hacked his computer,

32:16.635 --> 32:19.171
found the bribe to Westbay.
VANCE:
If she had evidence,

32:19.205 --> 32:20.472
why not go to the authorities?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.274
She saw the navy had
been after him for years,

32:22.308 --> 32:24.143
but couldn't make a case.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.012
So I guess she wasn't willing
to take the chance

32:26.045 --> 32:27.346
that he could get away again.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.314
Yeah, I guess I could
relate to that.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.648
Unofficially.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.018
And the ex-husband had no idea?

32:32.051 --> 32:33.419
No, all this time,
he thought that

32:33.452 --> 32:35.687
she had moved on
from their daughter's death.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.324
Had that wrong.
Yeah, and then some.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.726
I guess this makes more sense
than Amber being psychic.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.129
Yeah, well, we had
that wrong, too.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.697
Yeah, I was waiting for
the "I told you so."

32:45.731 --> 32:47.066
This is Bishop.
Agent McGee's been

32:47.099 --> 32:48.200
running around here
like it's Christmas.

32:48.234 --> 32:51.070
But is it me, or are you
actually a little disappointed

32:51.103 --> 32:52.438
that Amber's not
the real deal?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.206
Oh, hell, Leon,
a lot of things

32:54.240 --> 32:55.707
to be disappointed with
on this one.

32:55.741 --> 32:59.711
Yeah, I didn't just see
this case ending like this.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.747
Well... (sighs)
it's not over yet.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.583
That was the psych hospital
that picked Amber up.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.653
Transport van never
made it back.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.721
And they can't get ahold
of the driver.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.469
McGee, talk to me.
Still no word from the driver.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.737
And the van transporting Amber
was due an hour ago.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.274
Traffic?
Not that would
account for the delay.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.076
Or the driver not
answering his phone.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.643
Bishop, BOLO.
On it.
I just heard.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.412
McGee, Torres,
cell phone and credit cards.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.614
BOTH: On it.
Think Amber tried to escape?

33:35.647 --> 33:37.483
You tell me.
I don't think so.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.551
She seemed like a woman
ready to do her penance.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.420
That's not what my gut's
telling me.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.788
And what's that?
McGEE: Boss.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.223
State police just found
the van.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.724
It was in an accident
off a rural highway.

33:45.757 --> 33:46.758
No sign of Amber.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.527
Bishop, location.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.696
Gibbs, what's your gut
telling you?

33:50.729 --> 33:53.432
Listen to the gut.
Gibbs!

33:54.566 --> 33:57.103
Where's the passenger?

33:57.136 --> 34:00.572
No clue.
Gone when I came to.

34:00.606 --> 34:03.342
My partner was taken
to the hospital.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.644
What happened?
Steering went out.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.746
I thought I was a goner,

34:07.779 --> 34:11.650
but my guardian angel must
have been looking out for me.

34:11.683 --> 34:12.784
Why is that?

34:12.818 --> 34:14.486
There was, um, a branch

34:14.520 --> 34:16.755
sticking out of the
tree trunk that we hit.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.824
It was about to take
my head off,

34:18.857 --> 34:24.163
but the van swerved
at the last second.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.365
All by itself.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.599
It was the damndest thing.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.236
BISHOP: Gibbs,
got something.

34:33.439 --> 34:37.409
So, I assume these are used
to help patients relax

34:37.443 --> 34:38.844
on the way to the hospital.

34:38.877 --> 34:43.649
It looks like Amber found
another use for them.

34:43.682 --> 34:47.853
It looks like she booted
the tablet into the firmware,

34:47.886 --> 34:50.389
and used it to
take control of the van.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.690
You mean crash the van.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.692
And got hurt
in the process.

34:53.725 --> 34:54.760
GIBBS:
Her or the driver?

34:54.793 --> 34:55.827
Sloane was wrong.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.363
She is running.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.530
I hope so.
Whatever she's doing,

34:58.564 --> 35:00.399
she took one of the tablets.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.400
Can you track it?

35:01.433 --> 35:03.469
McGee can, if Amber goes online.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.137
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, do it.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.908
(line rings)

35:09.941 --> 35:11.477
Bishop, we got a problem.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.711
Uh, I'm here with Gibbs.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.680
Gibbs, we have a problem.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.748
Someone's trying to
access our system.

35:16.782 --> 35:17.749
What are they looking for?

35:17.783 --> 35:18.884
ABBY: The files we got from DoD.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.552
The case against
Victor King.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.788
I think Amber's gone online.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.624
Let her in.
BOTH: What?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.426
Let her in.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.894
You want to see what
she's looking for.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.463
Uh, boss, I think that's
a really bad idea.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.165
Do it!

35:35.634 --> 35:38.237
Okay, she's in.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.671
BISHOP:
What's she looking for?

35:39.705 --> 35:40.739
An address

35:40.772 --> 35:42.208
from a personnel file.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.675
Let me pull it up.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.844
Wait, that's Box Guy.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.613
He was delivering files
the other day.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.681
The-the civilian investigator
from DoD.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.817
Call him.
ABBY: Why would Amber

35:51.850 --> 35:53.385
suddenly be interested
in this guy?

35:53.419 --> 35:55.587
I don't know,
but he's not answering.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.689
GIBBS: Get Torres.
Tell him to meet us there.

36:02.761 --> 36:03.929
(phone chimes)

36:20.879 --> 36:22.348
Okay, sitrep?

36:22.381 --> 36:23.415
Neighbor IDed Amber,

36:23.449 --> 36:24.783
said she went in
a side door.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.418
McGee's out back,
has eyes on the target.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.954
What's she doing?
Same thing she's been doing.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.624
I knew it was you.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.326
What was me?

36:34.360 --> 36:38.764
I had forgotten,
but now... I remember.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.732
You're the reason

36:40.766 --> 36:43.935
Victor King never
went to jail.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.638
You're the reason

36:46.672 --> 36:49.575
my daughter is dead.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.845
(Amber speaking indistinctly)

36:57.316 --> 36:58.950
Boss, we got a problem.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.357
GIBBS: Bishop,
cover the front.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.560
Torres, on my go.

37:11.430 --> 37:15.467
Every new lead that
came into your office

37:15.501 --> 37:17.035
you'd slip to King.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.837
Please...

37:18.870 --> 37:21.873
That's how he stayed one step
ahead of the investigation--

37:23.909 --> 37:25.677
bribing you.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.713
I-I still have the money.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.782
If he'd gone down...

37:30.816 --> 37:34.286
that building would never
have been built.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.624
My daughter would
still be alive.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.893
The cash is yours
if you want it.

37:41.927 --> 37:42.894
Every dime.

37:42.928 --> 37:46.832
You think it's money I want?

37:51.002 --> 37:52.938
Go.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.843
Amber, put the gun down.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.513
Time to face the music.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.482
What are you waiting for?
Shoot her.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.516
Drop it.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.952
Shoot her,
she's gonna kill me.

38:06.985 --> 38:11.323
No, she is not.
Are you, Amber?

38:11.357 --> 38:12.891
No...

38:12.924 --> 38:14.460
I'm not.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.763
I took the bullets out.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.297
Not so good with guns.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.369
Is the driver okay?

38:27.138 --> 38:31.510
I know you guys
got to arrest me again,

38:31.543 --> 38:35.747
but just please tell me that
you're gonna arrest him, too.

38:35.781 --> 38:38.517
What the hell is
going on here?

38:38.550 --> 38:41.453
Like she said...

38:41.487 --> 38:43.622
time to face the music.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.990
The cash is yours,
if you want it.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.658
Every dime.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.896
DUCKY:
So, Amber

38:50.929 --> 38:54.933
actually identified
three people she blamed

38:54.966 --> 38:56.935
for her daughter's death?
Yep.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.871
And she got to two of them,
but DoD sent the third overseas

38:59.905 --> 39:01.039
before she could whack him.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.541
By the time he was
back in the States,

39:02.574 --> 39:04.843
her fugue had ended,

39:04.876 --> 39:07.913
and she repressed
the entire episode.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.081
Bottled it up tight.
Till we uncorked her.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.717
But this time around,

39:11.750 --> 39:12.918
Amber didn't want
to kill number three,

39:12.951 --> 39:14.753
she just wanted
an airtight confession.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.888
How much trouble
is she in?
A lot.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.957
She'll stand trial.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.927
I'm sure her lawyers will make
a mental-disorder defense.

39:21.960 --> 39:26.364
Well, if she hadn't
earned it, no one has.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.735
AMBER: May I say good-bye
to Agent Gibbs?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.937
That's why we
came down here.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.610
I just want to thank you.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.812
For what?

39:40.846 --> 39:43.048
For helping me remember.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.617
It was easier

39:45.651 --> 39:47.853
not knowing how Julia died.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.922
but it shouldn't be easy.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.666
And I also want
to ask you something.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.768
You made it crystal clear
right out of the gate

40:02.801 --> 40:05.637
that you didn't believe
I was hearing voices,

40:05.671 --> 40:07.439
but then later,

40:07.473 --> 40:09.475
I could swear
you seemed disappointed

40:09.508 --> 40:11.977
that... I wasn't.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.482
Or am I wrong?

40:18.016 --> 40:20.118
Take care of yourself.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.721
(elevator bell dings,
doors slide open)

40:30.061 --> 40:32.664
Well, probie,
was she wrong?

40:32.698 --> 40:35.066
'Cause hearing voices,
seeing dead people--

40:35.100 --> 40:36.935
I don't know.

40:36.968 --> 40:40.071
Psychic seems like a better
option than the alternative.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.649
An emergency ultrasound?
I thought you couldn't have one.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.584
McGee?
Is everything okay?

40:52.618 --> 40:53.919
It's Delilah.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.921
Something unusual came out
in her blood work.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.256
How bad is it?

40:58.289 --> 41:00.559
No, I haven't checked my e-mail.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.961
Are they sure?

41:02.994 --> 41:05.997
Okay, um, all right,
just stay calm.

41:06.031 --> 41:07.132
Uh, everything's gonna be fine.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.034
We're gonna handle this,
no problem

41:09.067 --> 41:11.236
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Your mom can wait.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.805
No, just don't hang up on...

41:17.308 --> 41:19.645
I gotta check my e-mail.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.846
Yo, what's going on, man?
What's happening?

41:20.879 --> 41:21.980
Is there anything
we can do?

41:22.013 --> 41:24.049
Huh.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.051
Delilah's fine.

41:26.084 --> 41:29.688
There was a scare, but
everything's gonna be okay.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.923
You don't look like
you're gonna be fine.

41:31.957 --> 41:34.225
That's 'cause I also
just found out

41:34.259 --> 41:36.928
the sex of my baby.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.964
It's not exactly
what I was expecting.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.198
Well?

41:42.233 --> 41:44.002
It's a boy.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.136
Yeah!
Yeah!

41:45.170 --> 41:46.204
There you go.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.306
And a girl.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.542
Oh...
