WEBVTT

01:14.532 --> 01:15.617
Ruby!

01:32.050 --> 01:33.426
Hot dog!

01:34.677 --> 01:35.845
Ruby, come get it.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.847
Hot dog!

01:44.437 --> 01:48.233
Oh! Good girl! Good girl.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.443
Good girl. Oh, Ruby!

01:50.527 --> 01:51.611
Oh!

01:51.694 --> 01:53.947
And you have a date with a family.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.490
Oh!

01:55.573 --> 01:57.867
Somewhere in you is an adoptable dog.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.953
I know. I know.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.080
All right. Good girl. Come on.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.811
Oh my gosh! We've got skunk soap.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.355
Perfect. Thank you. Come on, Ruby.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.775
- She knows a family's picking her up.
- She doesn't want to leave us.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.485
No, no, no, she doesn't want to leave you.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.280
Well, I'd take her home,
but my husband would leave me.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.199
All right, come on.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.912
This is serious now.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.456
You've been here six months. Yeah.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.250
You cannot blow this chance.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.419
<i>You've been to seven homes already.</i>

02:49.502 --> 02:50.837
Darn dog!

02:53.256 --> 02:54.465
Ruby!

02:56.217 --> 02:57.886
Get out of there, Ruby!

02:57.969 --> 02:59.345
Ruby!

03:01.598 --> 03:04.267
It's time to clean up your act, sweetie.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.686
All right? Come on, stinky.
Let's get you going.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.317
Ah!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.032
- Come on!

03:23.870 --> 03:25.914
Let's hope this placement sticks.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.498
All right.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.134
- Oh, I washed that.
- I just picked a piece of onion off it.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.219
Oh.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.845
Yum, yum, yum.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.057
Come sit with us. I don't even let
my third graders eat while standing.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.101
- I failed third grade. And fourth.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.020
- You're exaggerating.
- Oh, you'd have failed me.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.482
Never. You would be my favorite.
Teacher's pet.

04:35.984 --> 04:36.901
Bye.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.491
Careful today.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.828
Always.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.332
- Say "Bye, Dada."
- Bye-bye, Dada.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.215
That boat's
in a good spot there.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.884
All right now. That's clear.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.098
- Head down current there.
- Let's go. Seek!

05:07.181 --> 05:08.141
Morning.

05:08.975 --> 05:09.851
Morning.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.645
- It's the K9 unit.
- Yeah.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.023
Searching for drugs
tossed out of a vehicle last night.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.608
That's some of Matt Zarella's team
down there. Best of the best.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.569
Like a Navy SEAL Special Ops team.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.280
300 million olfactory receptors
in their noses,

05:22.363 --> 05:23.865
compared to six million in people.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.534
Their sense of smell's
100,000 times more acute than ours.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.786
If we can sense a teaspoon of sugar
in a cup of coffee,

05:28.870 --> 05:30.455
a dog can detect a teaspoon of sugar--

05:30.538 --> 05:32.832
In two Olympic-size pools
filled with water.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.918
Yeah.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.422
Uh, Daniel O'Neil. Rhode Island
state trooper, Wickford Barracks.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.717
Seamus Brady.
Retired maintenance, Scituate Barracks.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.594
- Well, it's good to meet you.
- Mm.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.513
Look. Found.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.890
- Bring it in.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.975
Smooth. Good job!

05:51.059 --> 05:51.893
Excellent work.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.312
I'm gonna be one of those guys
with one of those dogs.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.399
I gotta, uh… Good to meet you, Mr. Brady.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.860
Bring it in. Let's go, team.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.785
Weather continues to be unseasonably warm.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.662
Not even May, but keep an eye out
for stranded motorists,

06:11.746 --> 06:14.290
carry extra water
for overheating radiators.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.001
No matter the heat, hats stay on.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.295
I'm talking to you, Two Towers.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.130
- You got it, Sarge.
- You got it, Sarge.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.218
And of special interest to O'Neil.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.719
It's that time of year.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.972
Tryouts for the K9 academy
are coming up May 15.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.307
Right on, my brother.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.768
Eighth time trying to get in
is gonna be the charm.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.355
Be safe, everyone.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.615
Sarge. Uh, this year's my last chance.

06:47.698 --> 06:51.327
The applicants have to be under 30,
and I'm 29.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.162
I'll write the letter of rec again,

06:53.246 --> 06:56.124
but I'm not the one
standing in the way of you trying out.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.169
It's Zarella. His K9 unit, his academy.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.715
- Come on.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.801
Come on. She'll come.

07:06.884 --> 07:07.927
Come on, Ruby.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.514
Okay, go on. Go. Go on, sweetie.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.015
Go on. Go.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.810
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.604
- Oh.
- Aw. She got away.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.232
Oh! Okay, okay, okay. Okay!

07:21.315 --> 07:22.984
Go on. Go on.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.402
- Go!

07:24.485 --> 07:25.528
Go on.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.280
Good.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.782
Ah, there you go.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.161
- Come.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.872
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.541
I don't wanna see her back here.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.170
I'll have no choice.

08:14.035 --> 08:14.869
Thanks.

08:35.556 --> 08:39.685
Excuse me, sir. How many juice boxes
have you had this afternoon?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.814
All right.
License and registration, please.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.733
Mom!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.485
Hey, I was… I was just kidding.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.449
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right stuff to…

08:53.533 --> 08:54.825
No. The right temperament.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.620
No, no, no, no. Don't presume
to know what he knows or thinks.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.996
Daniel O'Neil.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.041
Like clockwork.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.751
Sir.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.760
All right, sit down.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.346
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right temperament,

09:15.429 --> 09:17.932
that I'm easily distracted,
maybe not much of a reader,

09:18.015 --> 09:21.394
but for the job I think intuitive skills
and people skills are more important

09:21.477 --> 09:23.145
than being speedy with paperwork.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.564
Plus, I love dogs.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.774
I'm ready for this.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.151
I'd really like to try out, sir.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.240
Aren't you qualified
in a bunch of other trooper specialties?

09:34.323 --> 09:37.535
Yes, sir. I am.
Hostage negotiating, EVOC training,

09:37.618 --> 09:40.246
peer-to-peer counseling,
honor guard, boat team, dive team.

09:40.329 --> 09:44.333
But K9 is my dream. You know that, sir.
I mean, I think you know that, sir.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.420
Sorry, sir. I don't mean to presume
to know what you know or think.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.799
- I'm a fan.
- Thanks.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.968
But also a truth-teller.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.222
K9 team requires calm

09:58.973 --> 10:00.141
and focus.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.811
You're all over the place.
You can't even sit still.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.816
- Who knows where your mind is.
- It's here, sir.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.074
I appreciate the candor

10:17.158 --> 10:20.369
and the persistence, but I don't see it.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.291
You do this
because you care about people, sir.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.668
The same as me.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.964
You want justice.
You want endings to stories.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.675
Sometimes happy endings.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.011
Sometimes just closure.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.722
The department has no money for new dogs.

10:41.766 --> 10:46.103
The German shepherds we use
come from Czech Republic or Germany

10:46.187 --> 10:48.147
and cost over $10,000 each.

10:52.234 --> 10:56.364
I know how much you want this.
How long you've waited.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.247
I'm a short guy.
I barely made the height requirement.

11:06.499 --> 11:11.420
I had to work twice as hard
to get to the same place as everyone else.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.674
I'm used to working ten times harder.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.469
Sir.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.474
Danny.

11:24.850 --> 11:25.685
Catch.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.021
<i>We don't have $10,000.</i>

11:29.105 --> 11:31.649
<i>With one kid here and another on the way,</i>

11:31.732 --> 11:33.317
<i>we have our hands full.</i>

11:33.984 --> 11:36.946
- Say what you just said again.
- I'm pregnant.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.031
<i>That's great news!</i>

11:39.115 --> 11:40.658
<i> That's great!</i>

11:40.741 --> 11:42.159
Oh, Mel! Oh.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.453
Ma?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.415
K9 dogs live with their officer partners
24/7, right?

11:47.498 --> 11:50.918
It's no trouble at all. They're trained.
You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.422
I'm thinking now maybe
it's not the right time for the K9 thing.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.550
<i>Remember how we were building the deck</i>
<i>when I was carrying Finn,</i>

11:57.633 --> 12:00.302
<i>and you promised a quiet pregnancy</i>
<i>if it happened again?</i>

12:00.386 --> 12:03.556
It's… It's not the right time for K9 unit.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.641
It's the <i>only</i>  time, Mel.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.185
It's a… It's a step up, a raise.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.396
We'll finally be able
to pay off college loans,

12:10.479 --> 12:13.023
save for our kids,
maybe get a bigger house someday.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.986
- So what's the plan?
- I'll get back to you.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.946
<i>- All right. Love you.</i>
- I love you too.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.620
- Hey. Down. Down.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.956
She doesn't listen. She's too high-strung.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.584
She chews. She digs. She steals food.

12:31.667 --> 12:35.629
She never sleeps. She barked all night.
She's not even housebroken.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.090
I know people who train dogs.
I could get you some names.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.551
- I'll pay for it.
- We're not keeping her.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.720
Maybe you have a kitten?

12:46.390 --> 12:49.769
That dog looks like Ruby, right?
But it's not. It's a new dog.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.647
She's had so many chances.
We can't keep unadoptable dogs.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.942
- She'll be put down tonight.
- Rick, no.

12:57.651 --> 13:01.530
Ruby's never had a real home.
She thinks this is home. We are her home.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.783
When somebody takes her,
she thinks she's just visiting,

13:03.866 --> 13:06.076
like going to the vet
and we're gonna pick her up.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.455
You know how these dogs are.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.583
Their family drops them off here,
and day after day they just wait,

13:12.666 --> 13:14.752
expecting their person
to come and get them.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.296
They'll wait and wait.
Sometimes they wait a very long time.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.800
It's heartbreaking.
Ruby just knows how to get back home.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.471
It can take a while before someone
as loyal and loving as a dog

13:25.554 --> 13:28.974
can commit to someone new.
Nobody's given Ruby that chance.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.227
- Pat, come on.
- One more day.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.896
I've got people I can call. Please.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.150
You have until the end of the day.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.444
But the vet comes at seven.

13:41.570 --> 13:45.115
<i>No, I wish we could</i>
<i>help you. We can't take any more dogs.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:47.785
Thank you.
I just thought I'd give you another try.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.953
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:54.792 --> 13:55.751
Hi, honey.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.588
Whoa. Can you just
take Moonlight, please? Thank you.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.048
You can't do this to me. No.

14:01.131 --> 14:04.134
No. We got four kids.
And a rescue for each one.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.555
Plus George, and Billie,

14:07.638 --> 14:09.390
and Barney, and Moonlight.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.226
<i>- You're killing me.</i>
- Okay.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.108
All right, here we go.
All teams, these three.

14:19.733 --> 14:20.901
- Up!
- Good.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.866
Hey.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.618
Hey. Pull up a stool.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.872
What? All right.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.793
- Lot better than sitting home watching TV.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.546
- A beer?
- Root beer.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.884
Finest sarsaparilla
with notes of ginger and clove.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.177
Yeah.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.307
Uh, you wouldn't know anyone with
a German shepherd to give away, would you?

14:52.057 --> 14:54.018
Nope.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.896
I, uh, I need one
to try out for the K9 unit.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.984
Don't tell Zarella you heard this from me,

15:02.610 --> 15:05.863
but you don't need a German shepherd.
Not technically.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.699
I've seen it before, up in Mass.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.161
See, what you're needing
is a young, good-sized dog

15:12.244 --> 15:14.288
who's curious,

15:14.371 --> 15:16.498
and agile, and has spirit.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.920
And costs nothing.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.756
Shoot.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.349
Hi. Um…

15:34.016 --> 15:35.893
I'm looking for a German shepherd.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.437
You lost one, or are you hoping to adopt?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.065
Um, adopt. Adopt. Sorry.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.984
Contact info here.

15:45.861 --> 15:46.695
Oh.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.531
Um, okay.

15:52.034 --> 15:52.868
Uh…

15:53.702 --> 15:55.788
We don't get many purebreds.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.373
Could be a year or more.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.042
Um…

16:00.584 --> 16:02.503
All right. Know what?
Thank you. I'm sorry, but--

16:02.586 --> 16:04.254
We got a lot of great dogs.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.716
I mean, let me take you out back.
Take a look. You never know.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.260
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.150
No name tag?

16:25.734 --> 16:27.945
Oh, yeah. That's so weird.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.120
- This one just gets to me.
- How old?

16:36.203 --> 16:37.913
A little more than a year.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.460
- Smart?
- Half Border collie.

16:43.544 --> 16:47.339
There's one named Chaser on YouTube
that knows the names of 1,000 objects.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.510
- You think he could be a K9 dog?
- She could be anything.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.806
- I know, I know.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.433
Come here. Fetch it. Fetch it.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.272
Ruby, right here. Fetch it.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.401
Bring it to me.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.246
Ruby. Ruby. Ruby.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.664
Come here! Come here! Come here!

17:20.748 --> 17:23.125
Bring it to me.
Bring it here. Bring it here.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.130
Good girl. Come here. Bring it to me.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.008
Good girl. All right, ready?

17:31.508 --> 17:34.428
- Ruby. Ready? Good girl. I know. I know.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.388
You ready? Come on, come on, come on.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.681
Come on.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.059
Oh, Ruby. Ruby. Ruby!

17:42.227 --> 17:44.563
Come here.
Come here, Ruby. Bring it to me.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.774
Here. Here. Good girl.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.485
Thank you. Thank you.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.031
Good girl. Thank you.

17:54.782 --> 17:55.824
She's special.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.330
So, are there forms to fill out?
Or… how does this work?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.585
So she's fixed.
She's had her shots.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.046
Anything else you'd like
to ask about her ? Like, her history?

18:09.129 --> 18:09.963
Uh…

18:10.881 --> 18:13.884
I think, uh, you know,
what I see is what I get.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.511
She was a street dog.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.388
Used to scrapping to survive.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.640
All right. Cool.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.143
She's gonna be the first shelter dog
to make the K9 unit.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.228
Um…

18:25.395 --> 18:26.230
Okay.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.691
She's a handful.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.237
Uh, you know, I like a challenge.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.781
- That's for you.
- Thank you kindly.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.825
Know what? This is for you.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.701
Oh! Thanks.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.412
- Some food here.
- Okay. Thank you.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.581
There's goodness in you, okay?

18:45.290 --> 18:47.376
Don't be afraid to let it show.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.003
Here we go.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.257
- Oh. Wow! Okay…
- Yep.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.634
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

18:55.717 --> 18:56.844
I'm just kidding. All right.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.846
- All right.
- All right.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.931
Thank you. Have a good one.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.558
- Thank you.
- Get the door for you.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.853
- There you go. All right.
- Hold on.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.355
- See ya.
- Shall we go home? Yeah, come on.

19:12.025 --> 19:15.529
- She's going with him. That's a good sign.
- Yeah, it's good.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.831
I'd fall apart if I got
that attached to every animal here.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.379
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.300
All right, Ruby. You ready?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.677
All right. Hold on.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.889
- Hi.
- A dog.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.265
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.310
You wanted to know the plan.
This is the plan.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.354
Hey, no!

19:49.438 --> 19:50.564
Ruby?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.033
Ruby, hey.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.075
Ruby, no.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.287
Okay, Ruby. No. Out… Outside.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.456
Uh-uh. Outside.

20:08.206 --> 20:09.333
I'm sorry, honey.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.919
Has Zarella ever taken
a shelter dog in the K9 unit?

20:12.002 --> 20:13.420
Not yet, no.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.256
Ruby, come on. Come on. Hey!

20:16.840 --> 20:19.301
All right. Come on. Come on.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.640
Ah! Ruby did that.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.184
Yeah. Yeah.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.145
Oh no, honey. No. Not near there.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.482
Yeah, we're gonna be
doing this for a while, aren't we?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.567
Yeah, Dad's tired, so…

20:36.401 --> 20:37.653
Where you going, bud?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.948
- Where you going?
- Read the book.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.366
You want-- The book's right here.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.870
Different book? You need
to pick a different book? All right.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
Hey, Ruby. Ah!

20:52.125 --> 20:54.294
All right, just… just hold that. Hang on.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.806
Okay, Ruby, come on. Good girl.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.517
- Wait. No.
- No, no, no. No!

21:08.600 --> 21:09.559
No!

21:10.060 --> 21:12.729
- Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
- Ruby. Ruby.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.523
Ruby.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.111
Hey! Come here. No. Yeah.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.739
- Scoot. Yeah. Good girl.
- What are you doing?

21:23.323 --> 21:26.743
She's like a foster kid.
She needs structure and stability.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.079
You read this?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.040
- Skimmed it, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.712
I'm so happy about the baby.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.425
Me too. But not about the dog.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.968
Look, she's clever.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.803
She has raw talent.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.265
No! Off! Get off!

21:48.348 --> 21:50.726
- Ruby. Yeah, okay. All right.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.979
Come on. Come on.

21:54.938 --> 21:58.400
- I just need to bond with her.
- I know. Maybe just bond out there.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.651
Yeah, all right.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.862
Yeah. Ruby.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.156
- Come on. Come on.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.532
Yeah. Hold on.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.950
Come on. No.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.536
- Off, off, off!
- I'm sorry, Mel.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.372
Come on, Ruby. Please. Come on, let's go.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.626
- Yeah.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.549
Okay, Ruby. Your water.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.552
Okay.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.640
Come on.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.271
All right.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.691
She'll come around, all right?

22:41.610 --> 22:42.986
She'll come around.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.659
He's sleeping with her?

22:52.954 --> 22:56.333
Hey, O'Neil! Tell your dog to shut up.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.759
Happy Saturday.
Your wife's gonna love that.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.139
- Hi. Morning…

23:16.436 --> 23:20.023
He's lost his monkey.
It's probably out there somewhere.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.149
Monks.

23:25.779 --> 23:26.655
Wow.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.949
The last 18.5 hours
have felt like an eternity.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.202
- Mm.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.621
Mel.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.707
That's amazing. Mel!

23:37.791 --> 23:40.544
Honey, I… I can't. It's too much.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.588
No, yeah, I'm gonna take her
to an obedience class this morning.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.674
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.885
Yeah. I just need to, um,
find one and sign her up.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.431
Perfect. Perfect.
Keep them close.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.390
Stop.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.350
Wonderful.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.185
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.605
Come on. We're going to the library first.
We're going to the library.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.523
Oh boy.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.025
Sorry. I'm late.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.610
Come in. Come in.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.947
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Sorry!

24:11.408 --> 24:13.743
Your dog is aggressive.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.704
It needs socialization.

24:18.456 --> 24:19.708
Yeah.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.545
She doesn't need a class.
She needs medication.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.423
- Ruby! Sorry! Sorry!

24:26.506 --> 24:28.842
Jeez. Unbelievable!

24:39.936 --> 24:41.563
- Ruby. Ruby.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.982
Hey. You see those dogs out there?

24:44.065 --> 24:45.692
Ruby, you see those dogs out there?

24:47.485 --> 24:48.778
That could be you.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.908
I thought you'd be grateful

24:52.991 --> 24:55.785
to have a family, a great job.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.164
Purpose in life.

25:00.415 --> 25:02.000
Excellent. Go ahead and reward him.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.546
I thought I was good with animals.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.758
I thought we had a connection.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.470
Getting out? You gonna join me?

25:13.553 --> 25:14.387
Uh…

25:15.138 --> 25:16.348
No, we're, uh…

25:17.766 --> 25:19.851
We're heading back to the shelter.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.521
She's impossible.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.356
You know, she doesn't listen.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.984
She destroys everything.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.696
You're giving up on her.

25:33.907 --> 25:34.824
Uh…

25:36.243 --> 25:38.245
Who's gonna believe in her if you don't?

25:41.122 --> 25:42.791
Who believes in you?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.877
I've been lucky that way.

25:47.587 --> 25:51.132
Well, maybe that dog
deserves some of your luck.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.395
If you'll try,

26:04.271 --> 26:05.855
I'll give you my all.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.985
Ruby, you see this basket?

26:10.986 --> 26:12.529
All my eggs are in it.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.121
Oh boy.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.959
Where's your leash? Here it is.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.045
Come on.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.756
Wait, Ruby, Ruby.
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.396
I'm sorry, Mel. I couldn't
take her back to the shelter. I…

26:47.647 --> 26:48.857
She loves it here.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.234
She wants to be our dog.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.153
I know she does.

26:55.947 --> 26:56.948
You do?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.912
- I realized something.
- What?

27:02.996 --> 27:04.539
She reminds me of you.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.124
Of me?

27:06.207 --> 27:08.293
- I'm nothing like her.
- You are.

27:08.376 --> 27:12.130
You're always busy, always enthusiastic,
going a mile a minute.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.174
Maybe all she needs is routine.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.509
Unconditional love.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.055
And a crate.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.604
- Thank you.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.236
Monks.

27:37.447 --> 27:40.575
She needs to be a family dog first
and a K9 dog second.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.286
- She can be both.
- Okay.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.080
Welcome to our family.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.226
I don't know if I can take it.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.477
It's heartbreaking.

28:08.269 --> 28:12.732
These sites say I've to be the alpha male,
but there are two approaches to training.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.777
Positive with rewards,
or negative with punishment.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.363
Mmm.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.033
Hmm.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.327
The positive one only. Ever.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.789
And make sure Ruby knows what you want.

28:29.707 --> 28:32.711
Don't be sad, Ruby. Don't be sad.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.422
- Don't be sad, Ruby.
- I… I can't.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.054
You didn't want to pee, huh? Come on.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.306
Did she go?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.517
Um…

28:49.102 --> 28:50.145
She did.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.480
Just now.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.944
I think she's claiming this as her home.

28:58.027 --> 29:01.072
- Oh, is that what she's doing?
- I believe so.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.075
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

29:07.036 --> 29:10.331
You're embarrassing me.
And you're embarrassing yourself.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.292
But you don't even care.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.761
See, Ruby? We do this outside.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.889
Huh? Wanna give it a try?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.557
Go ahead.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.520
All right, what do you think?

29:34.856 --> 29:36.858
Yeah. Smell that?

29:42.030 --> 29:43.531
Good dog!

29:43.615 --> 29:46.451
Good girl! Yeah, you did it!

29:46.534 --> 29:48.411
I can't believe that worked.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.288
- All right, sit.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.206
Sit.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.541
Okay, all right. One thing at a time.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.211
You want this? Want your stick?

29:56.294 --> 29:58.421
Yeah. You want your stick?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.377
Which one of you jokers took my panini?

30:46.594 --> 30:47.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.098
I'd like you to see something.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.183
It's off the kitchen video camera.

30:52.934 --> 30:53.851
Okay.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.034
You owe me a meatball panini, O'Neil.

31:10.118 --> 31:10.994
Yes, Sarge.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.666
- Ruby, come on. No. Come on.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.334
All right, stay. Stay.

31:19.252 --> 31:20.128
Stay.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.512
Ruby. Ruby.

31:32.682 --> 31:33.975
Be the solution.

31:34.642 --> 31:35.977
Not the problem.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.104
Please, Ruby.

31:59.876 --> 32:03.129
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>we're just trying to condition your dog.</i>

32:03.212 --> 32:04.839
<i>- Click means reward.</i>

32:05.965 --> 32:10.011
<i>So what you do now is reward your dog</i>
<i>for doing what you want.</i>

32:10.094 --> 32:11.387
<i>Right? Yes.</i>

32:11.471 --> 32:13.848
<i>It's saying, "Yes, I like what you did."</i>

32:13.932 --> 32:14.974
<i>"Good dog."</i>

32:15.058 --> 32:19.145
<i>Soon your dog will be able to perform</i>
<i>the commands without the click at all.</i>

32:22.607 --> 32:23.858
Sit.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.152
Sit, please.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.531
Sit, Ruby.

32:31.574 --> 32:32.450
Sit.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.702
Sit down.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.413
Ruby, sit down.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.916
Sit down!

32:40.500 --> 32:41.459
Sit.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.130
Maybe I'm deaf.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.509
Or maybe I'm pretending to be deaf.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.015
- Mel. Can you hear this?

32:56.099 --> 32:58.559
- 'Cause it's not working.
- Maybe it's the reward.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.607
Hmm.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.073
Here we go again.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.327
Hi. Do you remember me?

33:16.411 --> 33:18.037
I… I took Ruby home.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.540
She's not responding to clicker training,

33:20.623 --> 33:22.875
and I… I was hoping for some advice.

33:23.584 --> 33:26.754
- You're not bringing her back?
- No.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.091
Raw hot dog.
She will do anything for raw hot dog.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.884
I… I should have told you.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.594
Raw hot dog? All right, good.

33:33.678 --> 33:37.140
Uh, yeah.
That's all I needed to know, so thank you.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.141
Thanks.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.103
The taller the hat, the closer to God.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.191
- Sit.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.569
Good girl! Good girl!

33:49.652 --> 33:50.903
Good girl. Okay.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.322
All right, ready? Okay. Let's do it again.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.366
- Come on. Come on! Sit!

33:56.325 --> 33:57.785
- Sit.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.538
Oh my God! Good girl!

34:00.621 --> 34:02.832
Oh my God, you're so good.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.293
You're so smart.
All right, come on. Come on.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.253
- One more time.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.047
Good girl.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.465
Yep, stay right there.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.011
Come on.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.221
Okay.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.185
- Come on.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.269
Go get it!

34:24.103 --> 34:25.063
Pick it up.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.023
Good girl.

34:27.106 --> 34:28.065
All right!

34:29.025 --> 34:30.610
Come here. Come on. Go get it.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.575
Okay…

34:38.242 --> 34:39.243
Oh my God.

34:39.911 --> 34:40.995
Home.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.499
Ruby, you need an off switch.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.002
I could hire you out to the power company.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.587
I could hire you both out.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.763
- Ruby ready for tomorrow?
- She has to be.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.264
Can she sit and stay?

35:00.348 --> 35:02.350
- Everything but.
- Uh-oh.

35:02.433 --> 35:03.643
- Just like you.

35:03.726 --> 35:07.313
- I'm sitting. I'm staying.
- But you're about to go do something.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.774
- I left the hose running.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.745
- Are you nervous?
- Hmm?

35:22.829 --> 35:24.038
Maybe just get up.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.768
All right. Come here, Rubes.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.065
Yeah. Good girl.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.695
She loves that.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.286
- I couldn't sleep either.
- Yeah.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.426
I have faith in you.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.554
You need to have faith in yourself.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.682
Thank you.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.031
Come on.

36:51.751 --> 36:55.004
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay. Hey. Good.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.881
Sit. Sit. Good.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.594
Morning.

37:03.971 --> 37:06.599
Welcome to the tryouts
for this year's K9 academy.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.604
Who do we have there?

37:13.481 --> 37:15.399
Um… Ruby.

37:16.776 --> 37:17.693
Welcome, Ruby.

37:19.111 --> 37:22.240
All right, dogs in the pen
while we get started inside.

37:25.368 --> 37:28.829
Now, you're not trying out
for the K9 unit today.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.582
You're trying out for my class,

37:31.666 --> 37:35.294
which may or may not
qualify you to be a K9 unit officer.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.838
If you are accepted,

37:38.422 --> 37:41.050
these will be six weeks
of rigorous training.

37:41.133 --> 37:44.971
Then you must pass
a final exam for certification,

37:45.054 --> 37:48.975
which certifies you to work
in a K9 unit here or in another state.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.226
A final point.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.485
Your dog must have the right temperament.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.029
So must you.

38:03.990 --> 38:08.119
Search and rescue requires
calm focus and special compassion.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.623
You will deal with people
who are missing loved ones

38:12.707 --> 38:14.125
who might not return.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.795
Ask yourself now,

38:19.630 --> 38:20.923
is this work for you?

38:22.258 --> 38:26.137
Those of you who are sure,
come on outside. Let's see how you do.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.351
Boden, come on up.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.687
<i> Platz.</i>

38:36.397 --> 38:37.273
<i>Fuss.</i>

38:38.733 --> 38:40.151
<i>Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!</i>

38:41.319 --> 38:42.570
Ha!

38:43.070 --> 38:44.488
Rather good, Renny.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.660
Good boy, Renn.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.661
Up!

38:53.414 --> 38:56.375
- O'Neil, you're up.
- Okay. Let's go, Ruby. Come on.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.462
Ruby, sit.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.172
Down.

39:02.798 --> 39:03.883
Heel.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.680
Good girl. Good girl.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.392
- Good girl.
- Yay, Ruby!

39:14.727 --> 39:16.270
Come on.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.230
Good girl. Good girl.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.900
Come on. Come on. Yep, yep, yep.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.444
Good girl! Come on.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.113
All right.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.615
Good Ruby. Come on, up!

39:29.241 --> 39:31.869
Good job! Come on, come on!

39:32.536 --> 39:33.371
Up!

39:34.205 --> 39:35.331
Good girl!

39:35.831 --> 39:37.041
Come on. Come on.

39:37.625 --> 39:38.584
Come on.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.419
Sit.

39:44.590 --> 39:45.966
Tell her to stay.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.972
When I tell you to stay,

39:52.056 --> 39:54.100
you cannot move, no matter what.

39:56.102 --> 39:56.936
Stay!

40:00.940 --> 40:03.442
Pace out ten feet. Do not turn around.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.697
I had to drop off Finn at my mom's.
What'd I miss?

40:08.781 --> 40:09.865
They're passing.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.412
She still has to stay for five minutes
with Daniel ten feet away.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.415
Oh boy.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.753
Stay. Please stay.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.626
- Five minutes.
- Yay!

41:02.710 --> 41:05.004
Good girl! Good girl!

41:08.841 --> 41:10.843
Yeah, good girl. All right, come on.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.430
Now we test all teams

41:14.513 --> 41:16.682
for drive and a good nose.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.769
Search and rescue is…

41:20.853 --> 41:22.605
Hey, Ruby! Sorry about that.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.565
…serious work for us.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.984
- Hot dogs?
- This is not good.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.236
At least it's not a panini.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.988
- No, hey
- But for K9s,

41:32.198 --> 41:34.450
- each mission is a game.
- Stop. Stop.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.869
- Food is what motivates dogs.
- Stop, stop. Down.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.662
That and pleasing you.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.998
- Hey. Stop. Stop.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.001
Just one piece.

41:44.084 --> 41:48.339
Treats are for a job well done.
Not for bribing your dog to behave.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.929
Okay. I know this
will be new to all of you.

41:55.012 --> 41:57.389
I have hidden a human tooth.

41:58.098 --> 42:00.100
Considerate it cadaver material.

42:00.184 --> 42:03.187
It's an exercise
in searching for a dead body.

42:03.270 --> 42:05.314
Today, I want each of you

42:05.397 --> 42:09.235
to scent train your K9
to seek and find that tooth.

42:14.073 --> 42:16.075
Me first? A single tooth?

42:16.700 --> 42:17.535
All right.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.332
You're gonna teach her to do this
using a unique command.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.001
- "Look for it."
- Okay.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.796
- Stop. Stop it, Ruby.

42:28.879 --> 42:32.049
- Ruby, come on. Ruby, stop.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.885
Your dog's not using her thinking brain.
She's not focused.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.763
- We'll come back to you. Back in line.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

42:41.183 --> 42:43.936
Peter, your dog's had
some minimal search training.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.729
Let's show by example.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.360
- Tell him to search.
- Okay.

42:51.443 --> 42:52.820
Look for it. Look for it.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.115
- How does he know what he's looking for?
- It takes time.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.242
But eventually he will learn

42:58.325 --> 43:00.619
to associate that particular command

43:00.703 --> 43:03.330
with finding cadaver material,
once you click and reward him.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.252
- Ruby!
- Control that K9!

43:08.335 --> 43:09.211
Yeah. Ruby.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.963
Deepen your voice.
Be commanding.

43:11.046 --> 43:12.006
Ruby!

43:12.089 --> 43:13.215
Sorry.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.175
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.719
Ruby.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.221
Ruby.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.514
Ruby!

43:22.641 --> 43:23.600
Ruby!

43:26.937 --> 43:28.397
That's a hell of a bark.

43:29.231 --> 43:32.192
Okay, I want you to tell your dogs
to search for him.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.153
He's a moving target. Let's go.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.790
Ruby! Ruby!

43:48.250 --> 43:49.335
Ruby!

43:54.465 --> 43:55.382
Okay.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.344
Oh boy.

44:04.767 --> 44:05.643
Ruby.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.937
Hey, no! No, no, no, no. Hey.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.315
Ruby, put it down.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.484
Put the stick down!

44:15.611 --> 44:17.529
- Ruby.
- Good job, everyone.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.239
- Go ahead and reward.
- Ruby.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.660
- Put it down.
- What's she playing with there?

44:22.743 --> 44:24.745
- Um…

44:30.709 --> 44:32.920
Oh! Retreat! Retreat!

44:33.504 --> 44:34.797
Run! Run!

44:35.589 --> 44:37.091
Hey. Ruby.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.634
Come here.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.928
- Ow. Ow!

44:42.221 --> 44:44.139
Ow. Come on. Come on.

44:51.647 --> 44:55.234
It's not Ruby's fault.
She's not bred for this work.

44:56.443 --> 44:59.571
She's half Border collie,
one of the smartest breeds.

44:59.655 --> 45:02.032
She hasn't had all the advantages.

45:02.116 --> 45:04.827
She's all over the place.
She's not focusing on the tasks at hand.

45:04.910 --> 45:06.703
We're not in the class, right?

45:10.916 --> 45:14.169
- Did everybody else qualify?
- You're good at so many other things.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.756
- You gotta be realistic.
- I am.

45:18.882 --> 45:19.717
Sorry.

45:34.356 --> 45:35.649
So what next?

45:36.692 --> 45:37.818
I'm sorry, Mel.

45:38.819 --> 45:40.571
I wanted this for both of us.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.823
For all of us.

45:44.366 --> 45:45.451
A better life.

45:49.663 --> 45:52.082
You know I have a thing for superheroes?

45:54.251 --> 45:55.544
You wanna be one?

45:58.088 --> 45:59.840
Dogs have their noses.

46:01.341 --> 46:03.510
I always thought if I had
a partner with a superpower,

46:03.594 --> 46:05.387
it would cover for my weaknesses.

46:09.516 --> 46:12.478
In trooper academy, you made up
for dyslexia and hyperactivity

46:12.561 --> 46:14.688
with all-nighters and books on tape.

46:15.606 --> 46:18.817
Bigger guys than you
hit you hard in the boxing ring.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.694
You would not drop.

46:22.279 --> 46:26.074
Then you shattered your kneecap
just before that mandatory race,

46:26.158 --> 46:28.827
and you hobbled
the entire two miles in pain.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.287
I came in last.

46:32.372 --> 46:33.540
You finished.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.421
Maybe it's not in the plan.

46:41.048 --> 46:43.258
I can't see a path forward from here.

46:43.759 --> 46:48.055
And sheer willpower's not gonna work.
I could push myself but not Ruby.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.228
Yeah.

46:55.020 --> 46:57.356
A-ticka-ticka-ticka. A-ticka-ticka.

46:57.439 --> 46:58.398
Come here…

46:59.775 --> 47:01.109
I know. I know.

47:03.487 --> 47:04.321
House.

47:04.404 --> 47:06.949
I come bearing gifts.

47:07.699 --> 47:11.453
- Are we having a barbecue?
- You chose a dog just like you.

47:11.537 --> 47:14.164
Yeah, you've said that. More than once.

47:14.248 --> 47:17.459
You say you hated school.
You didn't want to sit at your desk.

47:17.543 --> 47:20.837
- You wanted to run around, not read.
- Reading's not my thing.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.757
Teachers underestimated you,
but you have always been smart.

47:23.841 --> 47:27.094
No… You didn't get to the point
where you get to the point.

47:27.177 --> 47:29.221
You would've done better homeschooled.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.807
Didn't really have that back then.

47:31.890 --> 47:35.519
Homeschooling would have
appreciated your differences,

47:35.602 --> 47:37.771
your energy, your passions.

47:37.855 --> 47:41.358
Encouraging your strengths
instead of focusing on your weaknesses,

47:41.441 --> 47:43.735
with lessons tailored to you.

47:48.156 --> 47:49.533
Be right back, buddy.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.745
- Your mother's a genius.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.707
Hi, little man. Oh!

48:10.012 --> 48:12.806
Maybe K9 school's not for Ruby.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.851
Maybe what she needs
is one-on-one learning

48:15.934 --> 48:20.022
with a teacher who respects
her unique, special abilities.

48:21.356 --> 48:23.525
More fun, less work,

48:23.609 --> 48:27.571
more quiet figuring things out,
less yelling, right? No bullies.

48:28.655 --> 48:32.451
There's more than one way to pass
that final exam for K9 certification.

48:33.869 --> 48:36.830
Right. I'll use all my vacation days.

48:36.913 --> 48:38.040
Starting tomorrow.

48:38.123 --> 48:39.124
Baby!

48:40.250 --> 48:41.126
Uh…

48:41.752 --> 48:44.171
Doubt there's an audiobook
for this, though.

48:44.254 --> 48:45.756
I'll be your audiobook.

48:56.683 --> 48:57.851
Hey. A-ha.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.311
- Hi, kid.
- Hey.

48:59.394 --> 49:00.604
What is all this stuff?

49:00.687 --> 49:03.899
K9 dogs have to get used
to seeing gruesome stuff.

49:03.982 --> 49:05.609
- Oh, I get it.
- Come on.

49:06.693 --> 49:07.611
Good!

49:12.449 --> 49:13.450
Find it.

49:22.084 --> 49:25.212
Good. Good girl!
You found the phone.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.132
- Good!
- Whoo!

49:34.596 --> 49:36.723
She sure has come a long way. Huh?

49:40.102 --> 49:41.436
Hey! We're rich!

49:42.646 --> 49:44.439
Whoa! That real?

49:44.523 --> 49:45.440
Yeah.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.194
- From my dentist.
- Explain this one more time.

49:49.277 --> 49:52.239
For a missing person, you wouldn't
give Ruby something of theirs to sniff?

49:52.322 --> 49:54.991
No. She's learning
to seek human scent only.

49:55.075 --> 49:57.619
So she'll know what to search for
based on the command I give her.

49:57.703 --> 50:01.915
It could be something touched by a person,
or it could be a person, dead or alive.

50:02.499 --> 50:05.627
Hey, Daniel. We figured
Ruby could use some socializing.

50:06.795 --> 50:08.588
Our dogs could use it as well.

50:08.672 --> 50:09.506
Ah.

50:10.632 --> 50:11.508
Nice.

50:22.811 --> 50:25.147
Told ya.
They're all talking about it.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.450
- There you go.
- Thank you.

50:37.325 --> 50:38.827
- Gansett?
- Thank you.

50:45.667 --> 50:48.045
- Free burgers, Danny boy.
- That's right.

50:48.128 --> 50:49.755
Free beer!

50:49.838 --> 50:51.548
- You nervous about tomorrow?
- No.

50:51.631 --> 50:53.133
- Liar.
- Yep.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.302
- You want me to come?
- No.

50:56.428 --> 50:58.638
If we fail,
I won't be able to look at you.

50:59.598 --> 51:00.515
Okay.

51:05.187 --> 51:08.065
"The K9 certification exam
is given once a year."

51:08.148 --> 51:11.485
"It requires handler and K9
to seek three specific items

51:11.568 --> 51:14.237
along an outdoor course in 30 minutes."

51:25.957 --> 51:27.667
Okay, just this once.

51:41.932 --> 51:43.517
Good girl, Ruby.

51:45.811 --> 51:47.729
The past six weeks have been a journey.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.733
Look who's here. Daniel O'Neil.

51:52.317 --> 51:54.653
Nowhere in your book
does it say we have to take your class,

51:54.736 --> 51:56.279
only pass your final test.

51:56.363 --> 51:59.032
- Yeah. Come on. Let 'em try.
- They've worked hard, earned the right.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.617
I was just gonna say…

52:02.244 --> 52:04.412
It's nice to see you back, Daniel O'Neil.

52:06.581 --> 52:08.125
This is how it will work.

52:08.708 --> 52:12.087
Each team will get 30 minutes
to find three things.

52:12.170 --> 52:13.672
Cell phone,

52:13.755 --> 52:15.924
firearm, human remains.

52:17.008 --> 52:18.885
First up, Peter and Kohl.

52:19.469 --> 52:22.556
- Could we go first?
- You got a plane to catch?

52:22.639 --> 52:25.100
I'm… I'm just anxious.

52:25.183 --> 52:26.935
They can go. It's fine.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.565
Okay. First up, Daniel and Ruby.

52:31.648 --> 52:33.066
Come on.

52:33.149 --> 52:35.360
Test starts out here,

52:36.194 --> 52:37.988
finishes inside.

52:41.366 --> 52:44.244
Your time starts now.

52:44.327 --> 52:46.204
Okay, seek. Come on. Seek.

53:07.809 --> 53:09.060
She has it.

53:12.939 --> 53:14.858
First object. Cell phone.

53:16.818 --> 53:19.362
- Good job. Keep going.
- Seek!

53:44.346 --> 53:45.263
She has it.

53:50.310 --> 53:51.811
Second object.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.188
Firearm.

53:53.271 --> 53:57.192
That is two objects
in less than two minutes. Extraordinary.

53:57.275 --> 53:59.402
- Now we head inside.
- Ruby, come on.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.490
Your dogs can relax
until we get back outside.

54:10.372 --> 54:12.290
- Where are they?
- Inside.

54:14.167 --> 54:16.503
- That's not in the manual.
- I know, right?

54:16.586 --> 54:18.380
But they did really good so far.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.800
Zarella's always got
a trick or two up his sleeve.

54:24.135 --> 54:25.845
All right, Ruby. Okay. All right.

54:26.930 --> 54:27.847
Final item.

54:28.598 --> 54:29.766
Human remains.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.769
Right. Now you go on.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.437
Look for it!

55:41.796 --> 55:43.131
Whoa!

55:44.674 --> 55:45.884
What the heck?

55:51.222 --> 55:53.850
- It's a big place.
- We blocked off some wings.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.326
Come on, Ruby.

56:17.499 --> 56:19.084
What's she telling you?

56:21.169 --> 56:23.880
- There are no remains here.
- Are you sure?

56:25.465 --> 56:27.592
You get one wrong, I can't pass you.

56:33.098 --> 56:35.558
Uh, if she says it's not here,
it's not here.

56:39.729 --> 56:42.440
Well, I guess maybe not everyone's
gonna pass today.

56:44.484 --> 56:46.236
But you and Ruby did.

56:47.570 --> 56:48.571
In record time.

56:49.572 --> 56:50.698
It was a negative search.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.868
Sometimes you're gonna be sent for things
that end up not being there.

56:54.411 --> 56:55.787
Congratulations!

56:56.830 --> 56:58.623
Good girl. Thank you.

56:58.706 --> 57:00.834
- You've done good.
- Good girl.

57:00.917 --> 57:02.001
Both of you.

57:05.463 --> 57:06.339
We passed!

57:06.423 --> 57:07.799
- Oh!

57:07.882 --> 57:09.509
- We passed!
- Yes!

57:10.093 --> 57:11.719
- Well done.
- That was great.

57:12.428 --> 57:14.764
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Hey, Ruby.

57:15.348 --> 57:16.224
Great, Daniel.

57:16.307 --> 57:18.560
-  Congrats.
- Thanks. Thank you.

57:25.650 --> 57:27.152
- Great. Good job.
- O'Neil.

57:28.903 --> 57:30.738
I want you to come work for me.

57:31.739 --> 57:32.866
Provisionally.

57:33.741 --> 57:36.578
We gotta see if Ruby's as good
in the real world as she was today.

57:36.661 --> 57:38.163
I'd be honored, sir.

57:38.246 --> 57:39.664
The vest is for her.

57:39.747 --> 57:40.915
Yeah.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.252
Stay ready,
and you won't have to get ready.

57:47.672 --> 57:50.383
Hey, how about that, huh?

57:50.466 --> 57:51.759
How about that?

57:52.469 --> 57:53.803
Good girl.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.346
Ta-da.

57:55.430 --> 57:58.766
Mel, it's too early to party.
I'm provisional.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.143
Be grateful.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.521
- We should've invited Zarella.
- No.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.275
I'll take that.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.612
Good dog. Come on.

58:10.695 --> 58:11.821
Good, Ruby.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.787
- Find them! Find them!

58:24.250 --> 58:25.502
Good girl!

58:25.585 --> 58:27.879
Good job, Ruby.

58:33.468 --> 58:35.845
- Rube, here we go. Here we go, Ruby.

58:44.562 --> 58:47.148
All right. Yeah, turn, turn.

58:48.316 --> 58:49.526
Turning.

58:51.027 --> 58:52.320
Look who's here.

58:52.403 --> 58:54.030
Yeah.

58:55.949 --> 59:00.161
Hey, did you know if humans disappeared,
the planet would be better off?

59:00.912 --> 59:02.330
But if ants disappeared,

59:02.413 --> 59:04.332
the whole thing
would come apart at the seams.

59:06.292 --> 59:07.710
You're not listening.

59:09.003 --> 59:11.673
Sam, everything's the same,
except for my uniform.

59:11.756 --> 59:14.676
The senior K9 teams
are seizing cash from drug dealers

59:14.759 --> 59:16.261
and apprehending suspects. And…

59:16.344 --> 59:18.346
I've been sitting on my hands for…

59:19.847 --> 59:21.766
months. The leaves have changed.

59:21.849 --> 59:24.978
Being the junior team
means you wait your turn.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.444
- You scared of him?
- I am.

59:34.612 --> 59:35.613
Me too.

59:40.702 --> 59:41.828
Who's that?

59:43.162 --> 59:45.665
That's Zarella.
There's a search down city.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.875
The senior teams are on other calls.

59:47.959 --> 59:51.254
- Text me when you find the stash.
- No. It's not stolen stuff.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.256
It's a murder victim.

59:54.257 --> 59:55.508
I gotta go. Ruby.

1:00:11.566 --> 1:00:12.483
All right.

1:00:13.151 --> 1:00:14.611
We gotta get this right.

1:00:16.613 --> 1:00:17.739
You good to go?

1:00:18.364 --> 1:00:20.408
Yeah? All right, thank you.

1:00:24.078 --> 1:00:25.246
Don't let me down.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:27.457
Police have a suspect in custody.

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:29.250
There's a missing person
presumed dead here.

1:00:30.001 --> 1:00:30.960
Right.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:34.797
Show 'em what you can do.

1:00:34.881 --> 1:00:35.923
Look for it!

1:00:58.112 --> 1:00:59.781
I think she found something.

1:01:06.412 --> 1:01:07.413
What you got?

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:09.415
Nothing.

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:11.042
Yeah.

1:01:11.125 --> 1:01:12.210
It's clean.

1:01:14.337 --> 1:01:16.881
You gotta make the call. Officially.

1:01:35.024 --> 1:01:36.109
No body.

1:01:58.548 --> 1:01:59.465
What…

1:02:02.510 --> 1:02:03.803
All right, Ruby.

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:09.058
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1:02:12.103 --> 1:02:13.604
You just blew it, Ruby.

1:02:16.274 --> 1:02:17.692
You blew it!

1:02:21.195 --> 1:02:23.823
Zarella's gonna call
and release me from his unit.

1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:26.784
I'm so sorry.

1:02:26.868 --> 1:02:29.745
No, I'm the stupid jerk
Zarella always thought.

1:02:29.829 --> 1:02:32.874
A guy who doesn't know
his own limitations or his dog's.

1:02:34.459 --> 1:02:37.837
- I'm sorry, Mel.
- I don't care if you're in the K9 unit.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:40.506
We can manage without the extra money.

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:42.383
I married you, not your job.

1:02:45.470 --> 1:02:47.346
My husband has his own superpowers.

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:49.849
His big heart.

1:02:50.391 --> 1:02:51.976
His boundless energy.

1:02:52.518 --> 1:02:54.729
His ability to hyper-focus on things.

1:02:55.813 --> 1:02:57.315
How he forgives.

1:02:58.232 --> 1:02:59.567
How he never gives up.

1:03:01.319 --> 1:03:04.030
How he trusts
in something bigger than himself.

1:03:11.662 --> 1:03:13.122
I'm keeping this one.

1:03:23.007 --> 1:03:25.009
Saving the world isn't the goal, love.

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:42.568
Stop.

1:03:44.403 --> 1:03:45.530
Go.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:40.793
Ruby.

1:04:45.673 --> 1:04:46.549
Ruby.

1:04:53.014 --> 1:04:54.473
Ruby, come here, girl.

1:05:01.355 --> 1:05:02.273
Ruby.

1:05:05.526 --> 1:05:06.444
Ruby!

1:05:11.949 --> 1:05:13.367
I'm such an idiot.

1:05:18.998 --> 1:05:21.542
She's gone, Mel. It's my fault.

1:05:22.209 --> 1:05:24.253
I pushed her. I stressed her.

1:05:24.837 --> 1:05:26.631
Then I blamed her for not performing.

1:05:26.714 --> 1:05:28.758
I didn't think she could do it,
and then she didn't.

1:05:28.841 --> 1:05:30.968
I mean, so what if she's not a K9 dog?

1:05:32.094 --> 1:05:33.554
She's still a great dog.

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:36.307
She's our dog. All of ours.

1:05:38.768 --> 1:05:39.935
I know.

1:05:41.312 --> 1:05:42.480
I'm gonna find her.

1:05:43.606 --> 1:05:44.857
Ruby!

1:05:47.068 --> 1:05:48.486
Ruby!

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:52.531
Come here. Ruby!

1:05:56.827 --> 1:05:58.829
- Come on.

1:06:05.378 --> 1:06:06.629
Commander, sir.

1:06:08.214 --> 1:06:09.799
We found the body.

1:06:10.925 --> 1:06:12.927
We got a tip from a neighbor.

1:06:13.010 --> 1:06:16.347
Buried under the deck,
covered in three inches of cement.

1:06:16.430 --> 1:06:18.474
It's a miracle Ruby even caught the scent.

1:06:19.558 --> 1:06:21.185
<i>You made the wrong call.</i>

1:06:21.727 --> 1:06:23.813
<i>- You should have trusted your K9.</i>
- I…

1:06:30.277 --> 1:06:31.278
Ah.

1:06:33.322 --> 1:06:34.782
Ruby!

1:06:35.616 --> 1:06:36.492
Ruby!

1:06:38.536 --> 1:06:39.704
Ruby!

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:49.046
Hi. Have you seen this dog?

1:06:49.130 --> 1:06:50.506
Ruby.

1:06:51.632 --> 1:06:52.675
Hmm, no.

1:06:52.758 --> 1:06:54.009
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1:06:54.093 --> 1:06:55.219
Thank you.

1:06:55.845 --> 1:06:57.013
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1:06:58.639 --> 1:07:00.933
- Mama.
- Yeah, I know.

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:02.143
Ruby!

1:07:03.769 --> 1:07:05.771
Ruby!

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:08.357
I've got you a hot dog, Ruby.

1:07:08.441 --> 1:07:09.483
Hot dog.

1:07:09.567 --> 1:07:12.570
Ball Park Frank all the way from Fenway.

1:07:12.653 --> 1:07:13.988
Fenway.

1:07:14.071 --> 1:07:15.489
Ruby!

1:07:15.573 --> 1:07:16.991
Ruby.

1:07:21.829 --> 1:07:24.874
Uh, Ruby's run away.
Has she come back here?

1:07:25.583 --> 1:07:27.042
No. I'm sorry.

1:07:27.752 --> 1:07:28.794
Okay…

1:07:29.837 --> 1:07:31.005
All right. Thank you.

1:07:40.347 --> 1:07:41.223
Uh…

1:07:46.729 --> 1:07:49.607
- Uh, sir, I…
- <i> Dan, there's a boy missing.</i>

1:07:49.690 --> 1:07:52.359
<i>Bring Ruby and meet the unit.</i>
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

1:07:55.112 --> 1:07:58.365
- Dan!
- <i>Ruby's not here. She ran.</i>

1:07:58.449 --> 1:08:02.244
<i>Well, go get her!</i>
<i>You're no K9 unit without a partner.</i>

1:08:04.538 --> 1:08:05.372
Sir.

1:08:11.962 --> 1:08:12.797
Uh…

1:08:13.464 --> 1:08:14.381
All right.

1:08:15.841 --> 1:08:16.759
All right.

1:08:19.845 --> 1:08:20.888
All right.

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:25.518
All right.

1:08:32.191 --> 1:08:33.567
Yeah, get in. Get in.

1:08:36.654 --> 1:08:39.156
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- Yeah.

1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:40.658
- Which way?
- Go! Go!

1:08:43.369 --> 1:08:45.412
- Which way? Where are we going?

1:08:45.496 --> 1:08:49.625
I lost my driver's license. Weak eyes.
I need to try that Uber thing.

1:08:51.377 --> 1:08:52.753
Where's Ruby?

1:08:52.837 --> 1:08:55.631
I, uh, wish I knew.
I've been looking all day.

1:08:57.591 --> 1:08:59.426
Dogs don't leave a good thing.

1:09:03.222 --> 1:09:04.390
I messed up.

1:09:05.933 --> 1:09:08.936
I didn't trust her.
I… I let pressure get to me.

1:09:11.522 --> 1:09:15.025
I did to her what people do to me.
Underestimate me, count me out.

1:09:15.985 --> 1:09:18.988
- That's why I work harder.
- To prove 'em wrong.

1:09:19.071 --> 1:09:20.573
Yeah, you know, to…

1:09:22.366 --> 1:09:23.868
To show I measure up.

1:09:24.869 --> 1:09:28.122
I'm not the stupid hyperactive kid
who couldn't read.

1:09:28.789 --> 1:09:30.958
- And have you proved it?
- Yeah.

1:09:31.625 --> 1:09:33.502
I mean to yourself.

1:09:35.796 --> 1:09:36.714
Sure.

1:09:39.758 --> 1:09:42.761
Turn your blinker on.
Pull over at Katt's here.

1:09:53.272 --> 1:09:56.400
I'm thinking you're the one who's lost,
not Ruby.

1:10:03.866 --> 1:10:06.368
Ruby, where are you?

1:10:09.705 --> 1:10:10.789
Come back!

1:10:17.796 --> 1:10:20.174
You didn't let me down. I let you down.

1:10:24.136 --> 1:10:26.013
I'm the one who's gotta change.

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:31.268
I have to trust.

1:10:33.354 --> 1:10:34.521
Really trust.

1:10:41.111 --> 1:10:42.112
My God.

1:11:04.718 --> 1:11:05.678
Ruby?

1:11:07.304 --> 1:11:08.514
I'm sorry.

1:11:14.103 --> 1:11:16.647
There's a missing boy in Glocester.
It's on the news.

1:11:17.398 --> 1:11:18.482
Zarella called.

1:11:19.608 --> 1:11:21.151
Whole team's mobilized.

1:11:27.449 --> 1:11:28.993
I didn't believe in her.

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:32.329
Do you know why?

1:11:36.333 --> 1:11:38.043
I don't believe in myself.

1:11:57.021 --> 1:11:57.855
Hey.

1:11:57.938 --> 1:11:59.732
<i>Hey, Danny.</i>
<i>Grinnell's called a meeting.</i>

1:11:59.815 --> 1:12:01.942
<i>- You gotta get in here.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.

1:12:06.030 --> 1:12:09.825
Glocester boy was hiking yesterday
with his mother in familiar woods.

1:12:09.908 --> 1:12:12.453
He took a shortcut home alone
and never showed.

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:20.544
Zarella's K9 unit has been searching.

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:25.382
O'Neil. Find your K9.

1:12:29.511 --> 1:12:32.014
And when you do, put a GPS tracker on her.

1:12:33.432 --> 1:12:34.767
Be safe, everyone.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:48.030
Ruby?

1:12:50.824 --> 1:12:52.701
Ruby! Hey!

1:12:52.785 --> 1:12:53.702
Oh.

1:12:55.037 --> 1:12:57.498
I never should have thought
you couldn't do it.

1:12:57.581 --> 1:13:00.084
I never should have doubted you. Or us.

1:13:07.466 --> 1:13:09.718
Let's get you home, all right? Come on.

1:13:10.761 --> 1:13:11.762
Ruby, no.

1:13:17.393 --> 1:13:18.519
You wanna go?

1:13:19.311 --> 1:13:20.687
Let's go to the search.

1:13:25.734 --> 1:13:27.152
Eat 'em all.

1:13:27.236 --> 1:13:28.821
Mel. Mel, hey.

1:13:28.904 --> 1:13:32.658
She's back. She's back. I got her.
We're heading to the search.

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:01.937
Let's go. Let's go. Good girl.

1:14:02.646 --> 1:14:03.689
O'Neil.

1:14:04.606 --> 1:14:07.192
You ready? You don't look ready.

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.945
- Reporting for duty, sir.
- Can I count on you?

1:14:10.028 --> 1:14:11.780
Never more than now, sir.

1:14:14.158 --> 1:14:15.451
Call everyone back.

1:14:15.951 --> 1:14:18.454
Set up a perimeter.
I need everyone out of those woods.

1:14:19.037 --> 1:14:20.873
I got my best K9 here ready to go.

1:14:21.748 --> 1:14:24.626
All right, I want Ruby to pick up
the most concentrated scent.

1:14:24.710 --> 1:14:26.837
It should be the boy's,
not one of our guys'.

1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:27.796
You need a coffee?

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:28.881
- No.
- All right.

1:14:34.887 --> 1:14:36.889
All right. Here's where we are here.

1:14:37.681 --> 1:14:40.851
All of this here is nature preserve.

1:14:40.934 --> 1:14:44.188
Dense woods,
granite outcroppings, a thousand acres.

1:14:45.063 --> 1:14:47.483
They started off here, the boy's home.

1:14:47.566 --> 1:14:49.818
That's the house right behind us.

1:14:49.902 --> 1:14:52.487
They went around and across the pond here.

1:14:52.571 --> 1:14:56.658
That's when Michael went off on his own,
presumably to head back home.

1:14:56.742 --> 1:14:58.577
Best hope is he got lost.

1:14:59.203 --> 1:15:01.496
The terrain is extremely dangerous.

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:03.248
Lots of widow-makers.

1:15:04.291 --> 1:15:05.459
My other teams

1:15:06.251 --> 1:15:08.003
are tired, hungry.

1:15:08.086 --> 1:15:09.505
They're exhausted.

1:15:10.297 --> 1:15:12.090
He's got very worried parents.

1:15:12.674 --> 1:15:14.218
I want good news for them.

1:15:17.930 --> 1:15:19.348
I know you can do it.

1:15:20.349 --> 1:15:21.266
Find him!

1:15:34.863 --> 1:15:36.990
Don't let one emergency become two!

1:15:40.786 --> 1:15:43.288
- Here, take my hat.
- Okay. Thank you.

1:15:45.415 --> 1:15:47.834
- No one's out there?
- Just you and the boy. Good luck.

1:15:47.918 --> 1:15:49.586
- Good luck, buddy!
- Thanks.

1:17:32.689 --> 1:17:33.982
What? What?

1:17:38.403 --> 1:17:40.238
- Good girl, Ruby! Good girl!

1:17:41.657 --> 1:17:42.532
All right.

1:17:46.536 --> 1:17:48.038
Good girl, Ruby. Good girl.

1:17:52.084 --> 1:17:54.628
We have him. We have him down a cliff.

1:17:54.711 --> 1:17:55.921
<i>We have him.</i>

1:17:58.465 --> 1:17:59.716
Boy's location?

1:18:02.803 --> 1:18:04.096
Boy's condition?

1:18:05.514 --> 1:18:06.556
Daniel.

1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:09.226
He's out of range.

1:18:13.271 --> 1:18:14.398
Michael!

1:18:20.904 --> 1:18:23.031
Michael, I'm coming.

1:18:24.950 --> 1:18:25.951
Michael!

1:18:29.579 --> 1:18:30.789
Michael!

1:18:33.834 --> 1:18:35.794
Good girl! Good girl, Ruby.

1:18:40.590 --> 1:18:42.175
Good, Ruby.

1:18:47.389 --> 1:18:49.766
Good girl, Ruby. Good dog.

1:18:50.350 --> 1:18:51.601
Good dog.

1:18:52.561 --> 1:18:54.479
All right, come on. Michael.

1:18:56.022 --> 1:18:57.524
Michael, can you hear me?

1:18:58.024 --> 1:18:59.067
Good girl. Good girl.

1:19:01.403 --> 1:19:02.612
Michael?

1:19:02.696 --> 1:19:04.531
Hey, Michael, can you hear me?

1:19:07.492 --> 1:19:10.036
We got you, bud. We got you.

1:19:27.721 --> 1:19:30.056
One, two, three, four, five,

1:19:30.140 --> 1:19:31.975
six, seven, eight, nine.

1:19:32.058 --> 1:19:34.060
One, two, three, four,

1:19:34.144 --> 1:19:36.229
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1:19:43.403 --> 1:19:45.864
Hey. Hey, Michael. Hi.

1:19:46.656 --> 1:19:48.867
Michael, I'm Daniel O'Neil.

1:19:49.701 --> 1:19:51.369
This is Ruby, my K9 partner.

1:19:54.915 --> 1:19:57.709
- Cold.
- You're cold? Here.

1:19:57.793 --> 1:20:00.378
Here, you're cold. Here you go, bud.

1:20:00.462 --> 1:20:02.005
Here you go. All right.

1:20:03.381 --> 1:20:05.342
There you go.

1:20:06.551 --> 1:20:07.969
Are you hurt anywhere?

1:20:08.929 --> 1:20:11.306
- My… My leg.
- Your leg?

1:20:12.891 --> 1:20:14.809
- This one?
- Ah!

1:20:14.893 --> 1:20:16.937
Yeah? That hurts? All right.

1:20:17.020 --> 1:20:19.523
Hang on, bud. We got you.

1:20:21.149 --> 1:20:22.275
Okay? Just stay with me.

1:20:25.946 --> 1:20:27.531
This is 223. We have him.

1:20:27.614 --> 1:20:31.076
Forty-one degrees, 54, 42.4 north.

1:20:31.618 --> 1:20:35.121
Seventy-one degrees, 42, 49.2 west.

1:20:36.498 --> 1:20:39.125
Good girl. All right, stay with me, bud.

1:20:40.377 --> 1:20:43.004
We have him. Grave condition. Send medics.

1:20:47.300 --> 1:20:48.426
They can't hear me.

1:21:03.733 --> 1:21:05.151
Hear that barking.

1:21:07.946 --> 1:21:10.323
Shut up! Everyone stop talking!

1:21:10.407 --> 1:21:11.366
Listen.

1:21:15.579 --> 1:21:16.663
That's Ruby.

1:21:22.669 --> 1:21:23.753
Follow me!

1:21:24.337 --> 1:21:25.547
Let's go. Hurry up.

1:21:25.630 --> 1:21:26.631
Let's go! Let's go!

1:21:32.262 --> 1:21:34.639
Right, keep barking, Ruby. Keep barking.

1:21:48.904 --> 1:21:49.779
This way.

1:21:59.789 --> 1:22:01.249
Careful through the water.

1:22:05.629 --> 1:22:07.047
Please keep barking.

1:22:07.589 --> 1:22:08.757
Just hang with me, bud.

1:22:20.894 --> 1:22:22.520
- Daniel!
- Hey!

1:22:23.104 --> 1:22:25.315
- O'Neil, we're here.
- He's alive.

1:22:26.232 --> 1:22:30.070
Hypothermic, possible concussion.
Broken leg, internal injuries.

1:22:30.153 --> 1:22:32.739
- Let's go. We'll get him out.
- All right.

1:22:32.822 --> 1:22:35.158
We're gonna
get you out of here, buddy.

1:22:35.241 --> 1:22:37.035
- Yeah. Just stay with me, okay?

1:22:37.118 --> 1:22:38.203
Hang in there.

1:22:39.371 --> 1:22:40.747
Good girl. Good girl.

1:22:42.749 --> 1:22:45.251
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.

1:22:48.588 --> 1:22:49.881
Oh, thank God.

1:23:01.184 --> 1:23:03.687
The boy's gonna need crutches for a while,

1:23:03.770 --> 1:23:05.438
but he's fine.

1:23:06.815 --> 1:23:09.234
- Thank you.
- Well done, son.

1:23:15.198 --> 1:23:17.409
- Thank you for giving me a chance.

1:23:18.702 --> 1:23:19.703
You got it.

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:23.581
- Couldn't be prouder.
- Thank you.

1:23:26.459 --> 1:23:28.962
We got a very grateful mother here
who wants to say hello.

1:23:29.045 --> 1:23:30.422
Oh, I…

1:23:34.217 --> 1:23:35.093
Wait.

1:23:37.303 --> 1:23:39.055
You're the lady from the shelter.

1:23:39.973 --> 1:23:41.433
<i>You </i>found my son?

1:23:41.516 --> 1:23:42.934
That wasn't me.

1:23:43.601 --> 1:23:44.519
It was Ruby.

1:23:46.229 --> 1:23:48.189
- She led the way.
- Ruby.

1:23:48.273 --> 1:23:50.316
- Go ahead, girl.
- Oh, Ruby.

1:23:50.942 --> 1:23:54.112
Who's a good girl!

1:23:54.195 --> 1:23:56.823
Oh, I knew there was goodness in you.

1:23:58.616 --> 1:24:00.577
You all know each other?

1:24:01.911 --> 1:24:05.040
She was supposed to be put down,
and then he came along.

1:24:06.374 --> 1:24:07.959
You've saved a life, you know?

1:24:08.918 --> 1:24:11.963
And then she saved your son's.

1:24:12.964 --> 1:24:15.508
- Wow.
- Now there's a wink from above.

1:24:15.592 --> 1:24:18.511
- Mrs. Inman?
- Oh, I think they're calling you.

1:24:21.848 --> 1:24:22.682
Thank you.

1:24:23.516 --> 1:24:24.350
Thank you.

1:24:29.314 --> 1:24:30.315
Trooper O'Neil.

1:24:33.818 --> 1:24:34.944
You're official.

1:24:36.029 --> 1:24:38.490
Promoted to full status K9 unit.

1:24:45.246 --> 1:24:48.041
- Thank you.
- Told you he'd come through for you.

1:24:48.958 --> 1:24:49.959
You did.

1:24:51.628 --> 1:24:53.213
But you had him help me?

1:24:54.839 --> 1:24:56.341
He's my best scout.

1:24:59.719 --> 1:25:00.553
Scout?

1:25:02.180 --> 1:25:04.099
Matt's always been rooting for you.

1:25:08.937 --> 1:25:11.189
All right, Ruby. Come on.

1:25:11.272 --> 1:25:13.191
- Thank you, officer.
- Sure. Have a good morning.

1:25:13.274 --> 1:25:14.108
Thank you.

1:25:18.029 --> 1:25:19.948
Hey, Mel. What are you…

1:25:20.031 --> 1:25:21.366
Aw.

1:25:26.871 --> 1:25:29.207
Wow, Daniel.
Unbelievable, man. Great work.

1:25:29.290 --> 1:25:31.501
- Thank you.
- Well done, Dan.

1:25:31.584 --> 1:25:33.795
- Here's your hat.
- Oh! Thanks for the hat.

1:25:33.878 --> 1:25:35.004
Anytime.

1:25:35.088 --> 1:25:37.006
- Incredible work. Incredible search.
- Thank you.

1:25:37.090 --> 1:25:38.508
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

1:25:39.717 --> 1:25:40.760
I…

1:25:49.769 --> 1:25:50.812
What?

1:25:53.565 --> 1:25:54.941
I'm just happy.

1:26:07.203 --> 1:26:08.288
There you go.

1:27:15.647 --> 1:27:17.440
Get in there, Bear. Come on.

1:27:17.523 --> 1:27:18.942
Bear. Bear.

1:27:19.025 --> 1:27:21.945
Bear, come. Get in there!
In the pool. Bear!

1:27:22.028 --> 1:27:23.363
- Go on.
- Bear. Come!

1:27:24.072 --> 1:27:26.241
- Bear.
- Come on. Good!

1:27:27.325 --> 1:27:30.119
- Bye, Dada.
- Bye, Mama. Bye, Mama.

1:27:30.203 --> 1:27:32.205
- Bye, Dada.
- Bye, Mama.

1:27:33.081 --> 1:27:34.249
Bye, Mama.

1:27:36.042 --> 1:27:37.794
- Get off!

1:27:40.088 --> 1:27:41.005
Stay.

1:27:42.924 --> 1:27:43.758
Sit.

1:27:43.841 --> 1:27:46.219
Sit. Stay.

1:27:47.845 --> 1:27:49.055
Stay. Good!

1:27:49.138 --> 1:27:50.056
Adding dog.

1:27:52.058 --> 1:27:54.769
Hailey, can you say anything
that'll make him react?

1:27:54.852 --> 1:27:57.188
Like, can you speak lizard?

1:27:58.314 --> 1:28:00.316
- Bye, Dada
- Bye, Mama.

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:01.234
Dada.

1:28:01.317 --> 1:28:03.778
Bye, Mama. Bye, Mama.

1:28:03.861 --> 1:28:04.821
"A" mark.

1:28:04.904 --> 1:28:07.323
Pick it up, pick it up!
Bear, Bear, Bear!

1:28:07.407 --> 1:28:11.452
- Bear! Bear! What are you doing?

1:28:11.536 --> 1:28:13.371
You useless mutt!

1:28:13.454 --> 1:28:14.831
- Bear!
- No, that's good.

1:28:14.914 --> 1:28:16.040
Good!

1:28:17.917 --> 1:28:20.128
Reward your dog for doing what you want.

1:28:20.211 --> 1:28:22.880
It's like saying,
"Good dog. I like what you did."

1:28:22.964 --> 1:28:24.674
"Now you get a treat."

1:28:24.757 --> 1:28:26.592
- Soon you'll be able to…

1:28:27.927 --> 1:28:30.304
…train your dog without the click at all.

1:28:30.388 --> 1:28:31.389
- Good boy.

1:28:31.472 --> 1:28:33.224
- That good?

1:28:33.808 --> 1:28:36.102
- Oh!

1:28:37.812 --> 1:28:39.230
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1:28:39.313 --> 1:28:40.273
Mmm.

1:28:40.356 --> 1:28:42.025
Bye-bye, Dada.

1:28:42.108 --> 1:28:44.444
Bye-bye, Dada. Bye-bye, Dada.

1:28:44.527 --> 1:28:45.737
Bye-bye, Dada.
