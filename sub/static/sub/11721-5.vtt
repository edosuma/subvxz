01:35.326 --> 01:37.576
Hey, Dad.

01:44.485 --> 01:48.454
Spoke to Aunt Deb last week.

01:48.456 --> 01:51.474
Looks like she's gonna
give chemo a shot.

01:51.476 --> 01:54.393
She, um...

01:54.395 --> 01:57.646
she said to me,
"The McGarretts are fighters."

01:58.950 --> 02:01.400
And Mary, Mary's good.

02:01.402 --> 02:04.036
You wouldn't believe it, Dad,
but she has, uh...

02:04.038 --> 02:06.072
she's become
such a strong woman.

02:06.074 --> 02:08.707
And she's such a great mother
to that little girl.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.925
She sends me videos,
like, every other day.

02:10.928 --> 02:13.662
I'm getting to watch
Joanie grow up.

02:13.664 --> 02:15.731
It's amazing.

02:15.733 --> 02:18.334
Kid's starting to take
her first steps.

02:21.889 --> 02:25.674
I really wish you were here
for all of this.

02:25.676 --> 02:29.011
I think you would have liked
being a grandfather.

02:50.118 --> 02:52.535
I miss you, Dad.

03:36.581 --> 03:37.913
Hey, Mary.

03:37.915 --> 03:39.248
Yeah, it's me.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.799
No, no, no, I'm here now.

03:40.801 --> 03:42.501
I just,
I wanted to call you guys

03:42.503 --> 03:44.920
and just check on you,
see how you're doing.

03:46.007 --> 03:48.224
I know. Four years.

03:48.226 --> 03:50.342
No, it's crazy.

03:51.345 --> 03:53.062
Yeah.

03:57.101 --> 03:59.435
No, I'm right here.

04:07.945 --> 04:12.031
Hey, Mary, listen,
let me call you back, okay?

04:32.019 --> 04:33.219
Excuse me!

04:34.105 --> 04:36.689
Hi. I'm sorry
to bother you.

04:36.691 --> 04:39.291
I-I saw you at...
John McGarrett's grave.

04:39.293 --> 04:41.277
Did you know him?

04:41.279 --> 04:43.229
You're his son,
aren't you?

04:45.066 --> 04:47.316
Yeah.
You have his eyes.

04:47.318 --> 04:49.785
Ellie Clayton.

04:49.787 --> 04:51.303
I'm Steve McGarrett.

04:51.305 --> 04:54.406
And I-I'm still at a loss.
I'm sorry.

04:54.408 --> 04:55.741
I can see that.

04:55.743 --> 04:59.295
Um... do you mind telling me
how you knew my dad?

05:02.216 --> 05:04.717
How do you like your coffee?

05:38.869 --> 05:42.554
When I was a kid,
my dad owned a bar.

05:42.556 --> 05:46.492
One night, someone came in
to rob it, and he was killed.

05:48.212 --> 05:52.097
Your father investigated.

05:53.968 --> 05:55.784
I'm sorry.

05:55.786 --> 05:57.970
He never found who did it,

05:57.972 --> 06:01.573
but your dad,
he stayed in my life.

06:01.575 --> 06:03.809
Every few weeks
he'd check in,

06:03.811 --> 06:06.111
and on the anniversary
of my father's death,

06:06.113 --> 06:07.896
he'd take me to lunch.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.735
We'd get some shave ice
and walk on this beach.

06:12.737 --> 06:15.621
It meant a lot to me.

06:15.623 --> 06:19.241
It made a difficult day
a little bit easier.

06:20.244 --> 06:22.828
I'll always be grateful
for that.

06:22.830 --> 06:25.481
So, now,
on the anniversary

06:25.483 --> 06:28.867
of his death, I come
to pay my respects,

06:28.869 --> 06:31.053
honor his memory.

06:32.973 --> 06:35.174
When was the last time
you guys spoke?

06:35.176 --> 06:38.227
It was shortly
before he died, actually.

06:38.229 --> 06:41.430
He called me to tell me he might
have a new lead in the case.

06:41.432 --> 06:42.815
Did he say what it was?

06:42.817 --> 06:44.650
No.

06:44.652 --> 06:46.602
He followed a lot of leads
over the years.

06:46.604 --> 06:48.003
None of them ever came to much.

06:48.005 --> 06:50.689
You know, no matter
how many setbacks,

06:50.691 --> 06:52.825
your dad, he never gave up.

06:52.827 --> 06:54.026
Yeah.

06:54.028 --> 06:56.278
He was stubborn like that.

06:57.782 --> 06:59.415
Oh, I have to run.
I'm sorry.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.700
I have to be in court in an hour.
What, you're a lawyer?

07:01.702 --> 07:03.335
How do you know
I'm not a defendant?

07:03.337 --> 07:04.620
Well, I've met
a lot of defendants,

07:04.622 --> 07:05.838
they don't look like you.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.589
I'll take that as a compliment.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.509
Deputy Prosecutor.

07:12.380 --> 07:15.047
Five-O Taskforce.

07:15.049 --> 07:17.216
Good to know
we're on the same side.

07:18.469 --> 07:20.803
I'm glad I had
a chance to meet you.

07:20.805 --> 07:22.221
Your dad talked
a lot about you.

07:22.223 --> 07:24.356
He was really proud.

07:26.644 --> 07:28.861
Well, it was nice
to meet you, too, Ellie.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.233
Hey, Ellie.

07:35.736 --> 07:37.953
Your dad's bar,
what was the name of it?

07:37.955 --> 07:39.154
The Aces High.

07:39.156 --> 07:40.406
In Kapahulu.

07:40.408 --> 07:41.557
That's right.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.493
What?

07:44.495 --> 07:46.995
Nothing.

07:46.997 --> 07:48.747
I-I remembered is all.

07:48.749 --> 07:51.216
Well, good-bye, Steve.

07:51.218 --> 07:52.718
Bye.

08:34.761 --> 08:36.712
Hey, whoa.

08:36.714 --> 08:38.096
What are you guys doing?
What?

08:38.097 --> 08:39.548
We're packing boxes,
just like you asked.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.299
With the newspapers?
Are you crazy?

08:41.302 --> 08:42.384
There's evidence in these pages.

08:42.385 --> 08:44.386
Of what?

08:44.388 --> 08:46.054
Several connected global
conspiracies I've yet to prove.

08:46.056 --> 08:50.609
You got 18 boxes worth
of files labeled, like,

08:50.611 --> 08:52.060
"Unexplained
phenomena,"

08:52.062 --> 08:54.112
"Area 51."

08:54.114 --> 08:55.814
You hold on to
old VHS tapes,

08:55.816 --> 08:56.982
along with newspapers.

08:56.984 --> 08:59.401
You know what your
problem is, brah?

08:59.403 --> 09:01.069
You're the hoarder.

09:01.071 --> 09:03.489
Yeah, a hoarder
of truth.

09:03.491 --> 09:05.574
Jerry, compulsive hoarding is
a symptom of OCD.

09:05.576 --> 09:06.992
Have you ever been diagnosed?

09:06.994 --> 09:07.960
Oh, yeah, Dr. Shaw?

09:07.962 --> 09:09.161
Hanging out with
dead people all day

09:09.163 --> 09:11.380
could be considered
borderline necrophilia.

09:11.382 --> 09:13.131
Have you ever been diagnosed?

09:13.133 --> 09:14.633
Denial is another symptom.

09:17.538 --> 09:18.837
What did I say?

09:18.839 --> 09:22.174
I'm gonna start
packing up the kitchen.

09:43.797 --> 09:45.781
What the hell?

09:45.783 --> 09:47.783
We're downstairs working, and
you're up here listening to...

09:47.785 --> 09:50.669
Pictorial onlay,
fine dust jacket...

09:50.671 --> 09:51.870
What are you
listening to?

09:51.872 --> 09:53.372
Nothing.

09:53.374 --> 09:55.173
Book on tape.

09:55.175 --> 09:57.926
You mean bookshop <i> owner</i> on tape.

09:57.928 --> 09:59.378
Bookshop
owner-slash-counterfeiter.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.296
I don't believe this.
Is this live?

10:01.298 --> 10:02.381
It's from a few days ago.

10:02.383 --> 10:04.466
I was just catching up
between packing boxes.

10:04.468 --> 10:07.019
Jerry, are you aware
that in the state of Hawaii,

10:07.021 --> 10:09.271
bugging someone is a felony,
and carries with it

10:09.273 --> 10:12.024
a $10,000 fine
and a five-year prison sentence?

10:12.026 --> 10:13.342
Are you aware
of the consequences

10:13.344 --> 10:15.143
of flooding the market
with counterfeit currency?

10:15.145 --> 10:17.279
This guy Farrow
could crash

10:17.281 --> 10:19.214
a small economy
if we don't stop him.

10:19.216 --> 10:20.532
There is nothing to stop.

10:20.534 --> 10:22.234
The Secret Service
already cleared Farrow.

10:22.236 --> 10:23.368
Secret Service?!

10:23.370 --> 10:24.503
What do they know?!

10:24.505 --> 10:26.321
They still believe that
Oswald acted alone.

10:26.323 --> 10:27.906
Jerry, enough.

10:27.908 --> 10:30.242
I know for a fact that
McGarrett already asked you

10:30.244 --> 10:31.877
to back off twice.

10:31.879 --> 10:33.545
And you didn't listen.

10:33.547 --> 10:35.998
How are we supposed
to trust you now?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.549
How'd you even manage
to bug this guy?

10:37.551 --> 10:39.284
Pulled a Trojan Horse move.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.503
Hid the bug in a rare book,

10:41.505 --> 10:43.655
and I sold it to him
via a third party.

10:43.657 --> 10:46.308
But don't ask me who,
'cause I'll never tell.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.926
It was Kamekona.

10:47.928 --> 10:50.228
I'll give you points
for creativity.

10:50.230 --> 10:53.682
But you got to get
the book back.

10:53.684 --> 10:54.900
And you got
to shut this thing down.

10:57.137 --> 10:58.353
Crap, it's McGarrett.
Please don't say anything.

10:58.355 --> 10:59.988
You gonna get the book back?
Fine.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.323
All right.

11:01.325 --> 11:03.492
Commander!

11:03.494 --> 11:04.860
Dude, I thought
you couldn't make it.

11:04.862 --> 11:06.161
Sorry, buddy, I'm not here
for the packing party.

11:06.163 --> 11:07.529
I need a word with Chin.
You got a sec?

11:07.531 --> 11:09.331
Yeah.

11:14.038 --> 11:15.921
What's up?

11:15.923 --> 11:17.356
Hey, listen.

11:17.358 --> 11:21.126
Did my dad ever talk about
a cold case back in '95?

11:21.128 --> 11:22.377
It was robbery-homicide.

11:22.379 --> 11:24.663
Victim's last name was Clayton.

11:24.665 --> 11:26.465
Yeah.

11:26.467 --> 11:27.966
Yeah, that case haunted him.

11:27.968 --> 11:31.603
I found this in his toolbox.

11:31.605 --> 11:33.388
I never understood why.
Then this morning I met

11:33.390 --> 11:35.307
Clayton's daughter and it
started to make some sense.

11:35.309 --> 11:37.059
Apparently, my dad
kept in touch with her.

11:37.061 --> 11:38.727
What happened?

11:38.729 --> 11:39.795
Well, there had been

11:39.797 --> 11:41.363
a string of robberie
in the neighborhood.

11:41.365 --> 11:43.565
And Clayton was
closing up this place

11:43.567 --> 11:46.234
when the killer came in
and shot him in cold blood.

11:46.236 --> 11:48.737
Grabbed the cash
box and took off.

11:48.739 --> 11:50.822
Meanwhile, the daughter was
upstairs in the apartment

11:50.824 --> 11:53.875
that they shared when
the whole thing happened.

11:53.877 --> 11:55.744
Poor kid heard the shot.

11:57.047 --> 11:58.797
What about suspects?
They ever have any suspects?

11:58.799 --> 12:00.465
Yeah, for a minute.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.134
Homeless guy.

12:02.136 --> 12:03.752
Uh... Ned Burrows.

12:03.754 --> 12:06.405
<i>HPD found him</i>
<i>during the canvass.</i>

12:06.407 --> 12:08.674
<i>Lab tested a sweatshirt</i>
<i>he was wearing,</i>

12:08.676 --> 12:10.342
<i>and it came back</i>
<i>with traces of GSR.</i>

12:10.344 --> 12:12.761
<i>He claimed that he found</i>
<i>the sweatshirt in a Dumpster</i>

12:12.763 --> 12:14.246
<i>a couple blocks</i>
<i>from the crime scene.</i>

12:14.248 --> 12:15.881
Of course, no one
believed him at first.

12:15.883 --> 12:16.898
But then he alibied out.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.150
But after they let him go,

12:18.152 --> 12:19.434
your dad became convinced

12:19.436 --> 12:21.336
that Burrows knew
more than he said.

12:21.338 --> 12:24.322
<i>So, he went back into</i>
<i>that neighborhood every night</i>

12:24.324 --> 12:26.525
<i>for a month,</i>
<i>looking for the guy,</i>

12:26.527 --> 12:29.177
<i>but never found him.</i>

12:29.179 --> 12:31.780
And over the years,
he kept up the search.

12:31.782 --> 12:33.281
The guy was a ghost.

12:33.283 --> 12:35.117
What?

12:35.119 --> 12:37.502
A couple of days
before my dad was killed,

12:37.504 --> 12:39.171
he called
Paul Clayton's daughter,

12:39.173 --> 12:40.505
and told her
he might have a new lead.

12:40.507 --> 12:41.740
Maybe he finally
tracked him down.

12:41.742 --> 12:43.775
Do me a favor--
go to my house, go through

12:43.777 --> 12:45.093
my dad's stuff--
tapes, journals.

12:45.095 --> 12:46.628
See if you can find
anything on Burrows.

12:46.630 --> 12:48.597
In the meantime, I'm gonna call
the property clerk at HPD

12:48.599 --> 12:50.048
and have them pull up
all the evidence.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.099
You want to reopen this case?

12:51.101 --> 12:53.752
Obviously this meant
a lot to my dad.

12:53.754 --> 12:57.139
I owe it to him
to try to solve it.

13:10.669 --> 13:13.670
Would the Rhodes Scholar
like another Shirley Temple?

13:13.673 --> 13:15.456
No, thanks.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.458
It's only
a report card, Dad.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.093
Hey, don't be so modest.

13:19.095 --> 13:20.594
You got straight A's.

13:20.596 --> 13:23.581
Your mom would've been proud.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.386
You need to take a break.

13:28.388 --> 13:29.820
I'm good.

13:29.822 --> 13:30.871
You work too hard.

13:30.873 --> 13:34.275
You're gonna burn
yourself out.

13:34.277 --> 13:35.810
Come on.

13:35.812 --> 13:37.028
Get up.

14:18.321 --> 14:20.187
Hey. It's getting late.

14:20.189 --> 14:22.356
What do you say
we call it a night?

14:22.358 --> 14:23.824
All right, you head
upstairs, get ready.

14:23.826 --> 14:25.910
I'll... finish up down here.
I'll be up soon..

14:25.912 --> 14:28.079
Good night, Dad.

14:45.598 --> 14:47.798
Ellie?

15:01.647 --> 15:05.282
I didn't even think
to call for help.

15:05.284 --> 15:07.952
I just ran downstairs, but...

15:07.954 --> 15:09.904
by the time I got there,

15:09.906 --> 15:12.239
my father was barely breathing.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.326
I just held his hand.

15:15.328 --> 15:16.410
I kept saying,

15:16.412 --> 15:18.913
"Daddy, please don't leave me."

15:26.255 --> 15:28.672
Ellie?

15:31.260 --> 15:32.710
I'm, uh...

15:32.712 --> 15:34.478
I'm Sergeant McGarrett.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.314
You can call me John,
if you like.

15:37.316 --> 15:39.650
I need to ask you
some questions...

15:41.104 --> 15:43.237
...if that's okay.

15:45.858 --> 15:48.075
Uh...

15:49.412 --> 15:51.612
Hey.

15:54.283 --> 15:57.001
Listen...

15:57.003 --> 15:59.120
you're gonna survive this,

15:59.122 --> 16:01.172
you know?

16:01.174 --> 16:03.290
It won't be easy.

16:03.292 --> 16:06.260
But you can do it.

16:06.262 --> 16:08.929
I've, uh...

16:08.931 --> 16:12.399
I've got a daughter
about your age.

16:13.636 --> 16:16.971
When things get tough,
I say to her...

16:19.142 --> 16:21.475
...you need to be strong.

16:23.579 --> 16:26.230
You need to be brave.

16:26.232 --> 16:29.483
And if you can do that,

16:29.485 --> 16:33.120
then you're gonna be okay.

16:36.993 --> 16:39.160
Shh...

16:40.630 --> 16:42.830
Hey.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.217
Hey.

16:53.476 --> 16:55.342
That lead your father mentioned?

16:55.344 --> 16:57.595
Do you think you might know
what he was talking about?

16:57.597 --> 17:00.731
I have a hunch, but...

17:00.733 --> 17:01.765
even if I'm right...

17:01.767 --> 17:02.850
I know.

17:02.852 --> 17:04.518
It could end up
being nothing.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.155
It's one thing you discover
early on, as a prosecutor,

17:08.156 --> 17:11.275
is just how often even the most
promising leads fail to pan out.

17:12.411 --> 17:16.280
Whatever happens,
thank you.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.165
You're welcome.

17:19.868 --> 17:21.252
<i>Hey, so we looked</i>

17:21.253 --> 17:22.869
at all the physical
evidence in the case.

17:22.872 --> 17:24.338
And it turns out
there wasn't much.

17:24.339 --> 17:25.539
There were no prints
at the scene,

17:25.540 --> 17:27.708
and no usable DNA profiles
on the sweatshirt.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.376
What about ballistics?

17:29.378 --> 17:30.477
Well, there was
only one bullet fired,

17:30.479 --> 17:32.046
no shell casing found,

17:32.048 --> 17:34.598
so more than likely the
murder weapon was a revolver.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.600
Now, CSU did recover
some bullet fragments.

17:36.602 --> 17:39.136
But ballistics testing
at the time was inconclusive.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.105
All right, have the lab
test those fragments again.

17:41.107 --> 17:43.057
Technology's come a long way
in the last 20 years.

17:43.059 --> 17:45.099
Maybe we'll get
something this time.

17:46.696 --> 17:47.728
Yeah, Chin?

17:47.730 --> 17:48.730
What do you got?

17:48.731 --> 17:49.863
Looks like you were right
about that lead.

17:49.865 --> 17:51.815
What? My dad was closing
in on Ned Burrows.

17:51.817 --> 17:53.284
Yup. Turns out

17:53.286 --> 17:54.702
that shortly before
your father passed,

17:54.704 --> 17:56.403
Hawaii launched a program
to issue state I.D.'s

17:56.405 --> 18:00.124
to the homeless, so they could
apply for jobs and services.

18:00.126 --> 18:01.792
Your dad checked
and found out Burrows got

18:01.794 --> 18:03.827
one of those I.D.'s,
which put him in the system.

18:03.829 --> 18:05.079
And once that happened,

18:05.081 --> 18:06.497
he started leaving a trail.

18:06.499 --> 18:08.382
Right, but my father never got
the chance to follow it.

18:08.384 --> 18:09.416
You're right.

18:09.418 --> 18:10.834
But now we can.

18:12.421 --> 18:13.938
<i>All right.</i>

18:13.940 --> 18:15.055
Here's the deal.

18:15.057 --> 18:17.224
Uh, that sweatshirt...

18:17.226 --> 18:20.644
wasn't the only thing
I fished out of the Dumpster.

18:20.646 --> 18:21.829
What do you mean?

18:21.831 --> 18:23.063
There was, uh, a metal box

18:23.065 --> 18:24.848
had about $350

18:24.850 --> 18:27.985
cash in it along
with a pretty nice watch.

18:27.987 --> 18:31.071
I figure whoever killed
the bar guy

18:31.073 --> 18:33.524
stashed the loot and was gonna
come back for it later.

18:33.526 --> 18:35.159
All right, when
they picked you up,

18:35.161 --> 18:37.444
you had the sweatshirt.
What'd you do with everything else?

18:37.446 --> 18:38.729
I partied.

18:38.731 --> 18:41.582
I spent most
of the money on meth.

18:41.584 --> 18:43.000
And then I put the rest back

18:43.002 --> 18:45.569
with the watch
and I hid the box

18:45.571 --> 18:48.205
in this old building
behind Leonard's Bakery.

18:48.207 --> 18:51.175
I figured I'd pawn
the watch down the road.

18:51.177 --> 18:53.377
But after the cops let me go,

18:53.379 --> 18:56.847
I figured it was safer
to just forget about it.

19:07.526 --> 19:10.361
See?

19:11.397 --> 19:13.480
There it is.

19:16.736 --> 19:18.102
What is that?

19:18.104 --> 19:20.154
I'm not sure.

19:21.824 --> 19:23.290
All right, we'll get it
back to the lab,

19:23.292 --> 19:25.209
see if we can pull
some prints off of it.

19:25.211 --> 19:26.827
You guys can take
him home now.

19:26.829 --> 19:28.245
I told you.

19:28.247 --> 19:30.414
I didn't have nothing
to do with that murder.

19:35.721 --> 19:38.639
This doesn't add up.

19:38.641 --> 19:40.307
It doesn't add up.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.475
The night of the murder,

19:41.477 --> 19:44.061
that neighborhood
was a ghost town, all right?

19:44.063 --> 19:46.513
The HPD response time
was seven minutes.

19:46.515 --> 19:48.148
Which means the killer
had plenty of time

19:48.150 --> 19:49.900
to take the loot
and disappear

19:49.902 --> 19:52.403
without anybody seeing him and
long before the cops show up.

19:52.405 --> 19:54.838
Right, so why stash it
and risk it being found?

19:54.840 --> 19:56.357
'Cause I don't think it had
anything to do with the money.

19:56.359 --> 19:58.409
I think the killer took this

19:58.411 --> 20:01.328
to throw the HPD off and make
them think it was robbery.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.663
If you're right,

20:02.665 --> 20:04.782
then Paul Clayton's murder
was pre-meditated.

20:05.951 --> 20:08.118
This was a hit.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.716
Ellie, there's, uh,

20:28.718 --> 20:30.818
there's something I want
to talk to you about.

20:34.874 --> 20:37.825
We followed up on the lead
that my dad had mentioned.

20:37.827 --> 20:40.911
And based on what we found,
we no longer think

20:40.913 --> 20:43.497
that your dad's murder was
connected to the robbery.

20:43.499 --> 20:45.483
We actually think
he was targeted.

20:45.485 --> 20:49.587
You're saying someone went there
intending to kill him?

20:50.423 --> 20:53.557
Ellie, I need you
to think back.

20:53.559 --> 20:57.011
Did anything usual happen in
the days before the murder?

20:57.013 --> 20:59.230
Did your dad do anything
out of character?

20:59.232 --> 21:00.998
Was there any strange behavior?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.733
There was this one incident.

21:02.735 --> 21:04.485
It was maybe a week
before the murder.

21:04.487 --> 21:06.604
I saw my dad
arguing with this boy.

21:06.606 --> 21:09.056
Jordan.
Jordan who?

21:09.058 --> 21:10.424
You remember his last name?

21:11.627 --> 21:12.777
Lewis, I think--

21:12.779 --> 21:15.830
he was a neighborhood kid--
he was 15, maybe 16.

21:15.832 --> 21:17.698
They were arguing
behind the bar,

21:17.700 --> 21:19.984
and it was, it was intense.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.585
I asked my dad
what it was about.

21:21.587 --> 21:22.870
But he wouldn't tell me.

21:22.872 --> 21:24.922
He said it was just
a small misunderstanding.

21:24.924 --> 21:28.709
Looking back and knowing
what I know now,

21:28.711 --> 21:30.094
it could've been more than that.

21:42.058 --> 21:43.724
I need a lawyer here?

21:43.726 --> 21:45.659
No. No.

21:45.661 --> 21:47.228
We're just having
a conversation.

21:47.230 --> 21:48.212
Hm.

21:48.214 --> 21:49.947
Had a cop say that to me once.

21:49.949 --> 21:51.782
Same way, too.

21:51.784 --> 21:53.868
All casual.

21:55.204 --> 21:58.239
Conversation ended
with me in handcuffs.

21:58.241 --> 22:00.441
Paul Clayton.

22:00.443 --> 22:02.409
You remember that name?

22:02.411 --> 22:04.445
He owned a bar
called Aces High

22:04.447 --> 22:06.864
in your old neighborhood.

22:09.919 --> 22:12.119
Yeah, I... I remember him.

22:13.239 --> 22:15.005
Got killed in a robbery.

22:15.007 --> 22:16.590
Well, that's the thing.

22:16.592 --> 22:17.958
That was the
theory back then,

22:17.960 --> 22:20.811
but now we think it might
have been premeditated.

22:20.813 --> 22:23.047
Yeah, see, a week
before the murder,

22:23.049 --> 22:24.899
he had a big blow-out
with Paul Clayton.

22:27.336 --> 22:29.403
Yeah, I see where this is going.

22:31.691 --> 22:33.774
But you're way off base.

22:33.776 --> 22:36.026
All right, then,
set us straight.

22:36.028 --> 22:38.863
You tell us how you selling
meth outside of Aces High

22:38.865 --> 22:42.116
didn't put you in conflict
with Paul Clayton.

22:42.118 --> 22:44.702
It did.

22:46.188 --> 22:48.789
But Mr. Clayton, man, he was...

22:48.791 --> 22:51.208
he was trying
to help me get out.

22:51.210 --> 22:53.093
He wanted me to quit dealing.

22:53.095 --> 22:55.863
He said, if I did,
he would...

22:55.865 --> 22:57.348
he would hook me up with a job.

22:57.350 --> 22:59.483
But I...

22:59.485 --> 23:02.720
I told him it wasn't so easy.

23:02.722 --> 23:06.840
It's not like I was dealing
because I wanted to.

23:06.842 --> 23:11.729
My mom was a junkie.

23:11.731 --> 23:16.967
She... she was in debt
to a local dealer named Sykes.

23:18.437 --> 23:22.623
I was working off what she owed.

23:22.625 --> 23:25.993
But Mr. Clayton, man,
he... he didn't get it.

23:25.995 --> 23:30.998
He... he thought
there was another way.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.134
He didn't get how things worked.

23:34.136 --> 23:37.054
That's what we were
arguing about, okay?

23:42.678 --> 23:46.313
Man was trying to save my life.

23:46.315 --> 23:50.935
I didn't... I didn't kill him.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.357
And if you don't believe me...

23:56.359 --> 23:59.026
check my medical records...

23:59.028 --> 24:01.028
right?

24:01.030 --> 24:03.247
I got this
surfing Yoks.

24:03.249 --> 24:04.531
I was at Kuakini

24:04.533 --> 24:06.867
getting stitched up
the night he got murdered.

24:11.374 --> 24:13.757
All right, we'll check it out.

24:25.972 --> 24:27.771
I liked Mr. Clayton.

24:29.608 --> 24:32.643
I hope you find the guy
that killed him.

24:39.485 --> 24:41.986
Hey, Danny, it's me again.

24:41.988 --> 24:44.154
Um, I'm just checking
on you, man.

24:44.156 --> 24:46.740
I just want to see
how you're doing,

24:46.742 --> 24:49.994
and see how the family's
holding up.

24:49.996 --> 24:52.913
Look, give me a call if you
get a second, all right?

24:52.915 --> 24:54.915
I'm thinking about you, buddy.

24:54.917 --> 24:57.334
Bye.

24:57.336 --> 24:59.636
Just got off the
phone with the lab.

24:59.638 --> 25:01.338
No usable prints
on the cash box.

25:01.340 --> 25:02.923
They also ran
ballistics again,

25:02.925 --> 25:04.725
but came back with
the same result.

25:04.727 --> 25:06.393
Said that if we had more
fragments to test,

25:06.395 --> 25:08.979
they might have
better luck.

25:08.981 --> 25:11.982
Your dad really went at
this one hard, didn't he?

25:11.984 --> 25:13.417
Definitely ran down every lead.

25:13.419 --> 25:16.086
Yeah, he really wanted
to get justice for Ellie.

25:16.088 --> 25:18.222
You know, I think that's why he
looked after her the way he did,

25:18.224 --> 25:19.523
because he never could.

25:21.944 --> 25:23.911
Actually, Steve...

25:23.913 --> 25:25.996
I think it was
a little more than that.

26:15.164 --> 26:18.832
You know, she's lucky to have
you looking out for her.

26:18.834 --> 26:21.635
She's just a kid.

26:21.637 --> 26:24.138
She needs people in her life,

26:24.140 --> 26:27.007
people she can lean on.

26:28.477 --> 26:30.010
You spoken to Steve lately?

26:36.185 --> 26:38.685
Been a while.

26:41.323 --> 26:43.357
<i>Your dad had some regrets.</i>

26:43.359 --> 26:46.493
But you know what I think
his biggest one was?

26:47.279 --> 26:48.745
Sending you and Mary away

26:48.747 --> 26:50.414
when you thought
your mother had been killed.

26:50.416 --> 26:53.951
I mean...

26:53.953 --> 26:56.670
he had to, he did that
for our safety.

26:56.672 --> 26:58.205
Yeah, he did.

26:58.207 --> 26:59.873
But I think he
came to believe

26:59.875 --> 27:01.508
it would have been better
for you if he hadn't.

27:01.510 --> 27:03.844
That he should have
kept you close,

27:03.846 --> 27:06.130
been in your lives every day.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.543
Hey, so get this.

27:19.545 --> 27:21.061
That card that was in
Paul Clayton's cash box,

27:21.063 --> 27:22.779
Yeah.
the one with the weird symbol on it?

27:22.781 --> 27:25.532
Well, I checked with
the HPD symbol images database,

27:25.534 --> 27:27.234
and I got a hit.
Turns out it was

27:27.236 --> 27:28.902
a membership card
to an underground card parlor

27:28.904 --> 27:30.204
called the Paradise Den.

27:30.206 --> 27:31.405
Looks like our Vic was
into gambling,

27:31.407 --> 27:32.456
maybe he got in too deep.

27:32.458 --> 27:33.657
I remember hearing
about this place.

27:33.659 --> 27:35.242
Had a reputation
for showing no mercy

27:35.244 --> 27:37.127
when it came to people
who couldn't pay up.

27:37.129 --> 27:38.745
We know who ran the operation?

27:38.747 --> 27:40.330
Guy by the name
of Dominic Alonzo.

27:40.332 --> 27:41.915
But you won't be talking to him,

27:41.917 --> 27:44.334
because he's been dead eight years.
That's helpful.

27:44.336 --> 27:45.719
All right, let's find somebody
who worked for Dominic,

27:45.721 --> 27:47.304
see if they can
remember anything

27:47.306 --> 27:49.673
about Paul Clayton
owing money to the house.

28:24.009 --> 28:26.627
Hey.

28:26.629 --> 28:29.796
I went past your office,

28:29.798 --> 28:31.298
they, uh, told me
you left early.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.966
I figured you
might come down here.

28:32.968 --> 28:35.302
Can never bring myself
to sell this place.

28:35.304 --> 28:38.505
Even when I was trying
to find money for law school.

28:40.259 --> 28:42.142
How's the investigation coming?

28:42.144 --> 28:44.311
I want to show you something.

28:44.313 --> 28:45.779
Okay?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.320
Do you know what that is?
No.

28:55.124 --> 29:00.127
We found that card in
the cash box that we recovered.

29:00.129 --> 29:03.964
That gave your father access
to an underground game room.

29:03.966 --> 29:08.502
Ellie, we think it's possible
that your father's murder

29:08.504 --> 29:11.405
could have been related
to illegal gambling.

29:11.407 --> 29:12.556
No, there's no way.

29:13.225 --> 29:14.808
I know it's
hard to hear.

29:14.810 --> 29:17.511
We all want to think
the best of our fathers.

29:17.513 --> 29:18.929
No, it's not that.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.848
Look, my dad used to gamble.

29:21.850 --> 29:23.817
A lot.

29:23.819 --> 29:25.936
When he was in his 20s,
he was a rounder.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.221
That's how he scraped together
enough cash to buy this place.

29:28.223 --> 29:30.023
But I know for a fact

29:30.025 --> 29:32.776
that he quit playing
before I was born.

29:32.778 --> 29:36.430
He might have had that card, but
I don't believe he ever used it.

29:36.432 --> 29:38.115
Maybe business was slow.

29:38.117 --> 29:40.200
You know, maybe
he needed cash.

29:40.202 --> 29:42.819
Listen, w-we're still
looking into it, okay?

29:42.821 --> 29:45.038
But in the meantime, there's
something else I want to try.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
All right?
With your permission...

29:47.042 --> 29:48.925
I'd like to exhume
your father's body,

29:48.927 --> 29:50.927
and have our M.E. perform
a second autopsy.

29:50.929 --> 29:52.429
Why?

29:52.431 --> 29:54.681
The bullet that killed your dad,
it was shattered, okay?

29:54.683 --> 29:56.767
And at the time, they only
recovered some of the fragments.

29:56.769 --> 29:59.269
Which means pieces
were either mishandled,

29:59.271 --> 30:01.221
or they were still
in your dad's body,

30:01.223 --> 30:03.440
and they simply missed them
during that first autopsy.

30:03.442 --> 30:05.142
Now, if we can get
those other pieces,

30:05.144 --> 30:07.227
our lab is gonna have
a much better chance

30:07.229 --> 30:09.396
at matching ballistics.

30:10.816 --> 30:12.616
Look, I can't imagine
how hard this is for you,

30:12.618 --> 30:14.568
asking you
to relive everything,

30:14.570 --> 30:16.069
having to grieve
all over again.

30:16.071 --> 30:18.055
And, Ellie, if you want
to say no, say no.

30:18.057 --> 30:20.290
That's okay.

30:20.292 --> 30:22.326
As painful as this is,

30:22.328 --> 30:25.629
I want to catch the man that
took my father away from me.

30:26.548 --> 30:30.217
Do what you have to do.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.801
<i>Doctrina DE Homine.</i>

31:09.803 --> 31:12.837
<i>Doctrina DE Homine.</i>

31:15.058 --> 31:16.257
<i>Doctrina DE Homine.</i>

31:16.259 --> 31:18.559
Okay, let's go over the plan
one more time.

31:18.561 --> 31:19.561
No need, brah.

31:19.562 --> 31:20.762
I know the plan.

31:20.764 --> 31:22.196
Don't get caught
wearing a wire.

31:22.198 --> 31:24.232
Don't worry.

31:24.234 --> 31:26.184
I got this.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.870
Aloha.

31:47.123 --> 31:50.425
Hmm. Can I help you
with anything?

31:50.427 --> 31:52.427
Yeah, my cousin was
in here recently.

31:52.429 --> 31:55.129
Uh... big guy, looks like me.

31:55.849 --> 31:57.965
Only not as handsome.

31:57.967 --> 32:00.968
He sold you a copy of
<i>Lecanto's Doctrina DE Homine.</i>

32:00.970 --> 32:02.937
Oh, yes. Of course.

32:02.939 --> 32:05.139
Wonderful copy,
splendid condition.

32:05.141 --> 32:08.026
Yeah, I need it back.

32:08.028 --> 32:09.694
Pardon?

32:09.696 --> 32:12.063
That book has been
in our family for generations.

32:12.065 --> 32:14.399
My cousin had
no right to sell it.

32:14.401 --> 32:16.818
He only did it to support
his drug habit.

32:16.820 --> 32:18.820
Oh, I see.

32:18.822 --> 32:21.606
Give you $500 for it.

32:21.608 --> 32:24.042
I'm awfully sorry, sir.

32:24.044 --> 32:27.045
But, you see, that book
was sold yesterday.

32:29.499 --> 32:32.667
You crime fighters are in luck.

32:32.669 --> 32:36.003
I put a picture of your Vic
in front of some card dealers

32:36.005 --> 32:40.475
who worked the Paradise Den
back in '95.

32:40.477 --> 32:42.176
Turns out one of 'em actually
remembered the brother.

32:42.178 --> 32:44.896
So, Paul Clayton,
was he a regular there?

32:44.898 --> 32:45.898
No, just stopped in once.

32:45.899 --> 32:47.181
And your friend
remembers him?

32:47.183 --> 32:48.349
It was
a memorable visit.

32:48.351 --> 32:50.318
According to my friend,
there was an incident.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.103
He was hazy
with the details,

32:52.105 --> 32:54.655
but apparently your Vic
got into it

32:54.657 --> 32:56.524
with some card players
one night.

32:56.526 --> 32:59.360
And these guys were
some serious trouble.

32:59.362 --> 33:01.496
My friend don't
remember names,

33:01.498 --> 33:03.614
but at least two
of them was SVL.

33:03.616 --> 33:04.949
SVL? What's that?

33:04.951 --> 33:06.367
It's a Samoan
street gang.

33:06.369 --> 33:08.202
They had a big presence on
the island till the mid-'90s.

33:08.204 --> 33:09.704
They were
pretty vicious.

33:09.706 --> 33:11.089
And definitely not
the kind of folks

33:11.091 --> 33:13.491
you want to antagonize.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.542
Thanks, buddy.

33:14.544 --> 33:16.594
Okay, so we know
Paul Clayton was a card shark.

33:16.596 --> 33:18.129
Maybe he was hustling
some of these SVL guys

33:18.131 --> 33:19.297
and they got wise to him.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.241
All right, so the bullet
that killed Paul Clayton

33:47.243 --> 33:48.993
was matched to a gun
that was used

33:48.995 --> 33:51.129
in an attempted homicide five
months before Paul's murder.

33:51.131 --> 33:52.580
There were no
arrests were made,

33:52.582 --> 33:54.248
but the primary suspect
in the case

33:54.250 --> 33:55.917
was one Tony Malua.
What do we know about him?

33:55.919 --> 33:57.235
Well, today,

33:57.237 --> 33:58.302
he's a legit
businessman

33:58.304 --> 33:59.670
who builds and sells
koa furniture.

33:59.672 --> 34:01.005
But in a
previous life,

34:01.007 --> 34:03.307
he was a known SVL member
who served time

34:03.309 --> 34:05.092
for aggravated
assault.

34:05.094 --> 34:07.378
Malua's name came up
in some old HPD vice reports

34:07.380 --> 34:08.596
as someone who frequented

34:08.598 --> 34:10.882
many of Oahu's
illegal gaming rooms,

34:10.884 --> 34:11.916
including
Paradise Den.

34:11.918 --> 34:13.551
I think we may have
found our killer.

34:13.553 --> 34:14.936
Let's go.

34:14.938 --> 34:16.554
Hey!
What the hell's this all about?

34:16.556 --> 34:18.188
Why don't you
take a look?

34:18.190 --> 34:19.824
Who's that?

34:19.826 --> 34:21.025
Oh, you don't
recognize him, huh?

34:21.027 --> 34:22.243
Sit down.

34:24.914 --> 34:25.929
Kapahulu.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.614
19 years ago.
You turned this man's

34:27.617 --> 34:28.866
daughter into an orphan.

34:28.868 --> 34:29.867
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:29.869 --> 34:32.119
I don't know
that <i> haole.</i>

34:32.121 --> 34:34.621
You and that <i> haole</i> got into it
at the Paradise Den.

34:34.623 --> 34:36.290
Jog your memory?

34:38.527 --> 34:40.178
And now

34:40.179 --> 34:41.344
it all comes back.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.463
Okay, look.

34:42.465 --> 34:44.382
- That wasn't me.
- Stop! We got

34:44.384 --> 34:45.384
the bullet, all right?

34:45.385 --> 34:46.717
And it came from your gun.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.302
All right, fine.

34:49.022 --> 34:50.638
I don't deny it,

34:50.639 --> 34:51.922
- but I didn't pull that trigger.
- Really?

34:51.925 --> 34:54.308
We must've made a mistake.
I swear!

34:54.310 --> 34:55.943
On my life.

34:55.945 --> 34:57.695
It was my man Sykes
who shot that guy.

34:57.697 --> 34:59.814
I just gave him the piece.
Hang on.

34:59.816 --> 35:01.148
Sykes?

35:01.150 --> 35:02.400
Yeah.

35:02.402 --> 35:04.986
It was him who got into it
with the <i> haole,</i> not me.

35:04.988 --> 35:07.738
They was arguing
over some corner boy.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.992
Start at the beginning.

35:10.994 --> 35:14.445
The <i> haole</i> came into the
Paradise with five large.

35:14.447 --> 35:16.497
Told Sykes he'd play
heads-up poker with him

35:16.499 --> 35:19.000
for the kid's freedom,
so they did.

35:19.002 --> 35:21.085
And then the guy
took Sykes down.

35:21.087 --> 35:24.171
Humiliated him in
front of everybody.

35:24.173 --> 35:25.389
Sykes got pissed.

35:25.391 --> 35:28.009
Right as it was
about to get physical,

35:28.011 --> 35:29.844
the pit boss threw the <i> haole</i> out
for his own safety.

35:29.846 --> 35:32.013
But Sykes...

35:32.015 --> 35:33.231
he just got angrier.

35:35.318 --> 35:36.817
Couldn't let it go.

35:38.471 --> 35:40.972
All right, so here's what I have
on Sykes, first name Jimmy.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.757
He's a former ice pusher,

35:42.759 --> 35:44.025
owns a club in Chinatown.

35:44.027 --> 35:46.861
Okay, well, given
what Jordan told us,

35:46.863 --> 35:48.996
I think we all believe
that Malua's telling the truth, right?

35:48.998 --> 35:50.498
I think we got
a problem.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.416
All we got
is Malua's word.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.868
Short of finding
the murder weapon

35:53.870 --> 35:55.002
with Sykes's
prints on it,

35:55.004 --> 35:56.754
how do we prove
this guy's our killer?

35:56.756 --> 35:58.372
I got an idea.

36:07.383 --> 36:09.517
- What do you guys want now?
- You said you hoped

36:09.519 --> 36:11.185
we'd catch Paul
Clayton's killer.

36:13.723 --> 36:15.523
How'd you like to
help us do it?

36:35.883 --> 36:37.383
<i>Doors open at 9:00, bro.</i>

36:37.386 --> 36:39.186
<i>Yeah. I came here to see Jimmy.</i>

36:39.188 --> 36:40.470
<i>He expecting you?</i>

36:40.472 --> 36:41.888
Just tell him, uh...

36:41.890 --> 36:44.107
Jordan Lewis came to say hello.

36:44.109 --> 36:46.276
I don't care. All right?

36:46.278 --> 36:47.278
You tell him...

36:47.279 --> 36:48.729
whatever you're
gonna tell him.

36:48.731 --> 36:49.731
I don't care.

36:49.732 --> 36:50.732
All right?

36:50.733 --> 36:52.199
Just don't
bother me anymore.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.086
Wow, this I had to see.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.204
What's up, J?

36:57.206 --> 36:58.455
Look at you.

36:58.457 --> 37:00.657
You were a scrawny little kid
last time I saw you.

37:00.659 --> 37:02.042
Now you're
all shredded.

37:03.996 --> 37:05.329
But I guess there
ain't much to do

37:05.331 --> 37:06.863
inside but hit the iron.

37:06.865 --> 37:09.466
Yeah, man, it's all there is.

37:10.502 --> 37:12.336
Go.

37:12.338 --> 37:15.255
So when'd
you get out?

37:15.257 --> 37:16.239
Couple days ago.

37:16.241 --> 37:17.891
So what brings you here?

37:17.893 --> 37:19.926
I was looking for work.

37:19.928 --> 37:22.596
You know, thought
maybe you could, uh...

37:22.598 --> 37:23.480
Hook you up with a job.

37:23.482 --> 37:24.681
Yeah.

37:24.683 --> 37:26.650
And why would
I do that?

37:26.652 --> 37:28.485
Because you know me, man.

37:28.487 --> 37:30.570
You can trust me.

37:30.572 --> 37:33.023
You know that.

37:33.025 --> 37:34.274
I could trust you

37:34.276 --> 37:35.909
when you were
a little kid.

37:35.911 --> 37:37.444
'Cause I owned
your mom.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.347
But that was then.

37:42.785 --> 37:43.785
Look,

37:43.786 --> 37:45.669
I'll-I'll take anything, man.

37:45.671 --> 37:47.120
Right?
I'll do whatever you want.

37:47.122 --> 37:48.205
Yeah, but what
can you do?

37:48.207 --> 37:49.706
You spent

37:49.708 --> 37:51.425
half your adult life inside.

37:51.427 --> 37:52.959
What skills have you got

37:52.961 --> 37:54.294
that have any value
in the real world?

37:54.296 --> 37:58.131
Why would
I help you?

37:58.133 --> 37:59.833
'Cause you owe me.

37:59.835 --> 38:01.051
I owe you?

38:01.053 --> 38:02.135
For what?

38:02.137 --> 38:03.720
Keeping my mouth shut
all these years.

38:03.722 --> 38:06.523
Slow down, kid.
You're gonna spook him.

38:06.525 --> 38:07.557
I don't know what talking about.

38:07.559 --> 38:09.259
Talking about Paul Clayton.

38:09.261 --> 38:11.144
Remember him?

38:12.231 --> 38:13.231
Hmm?

38:13.232 --> 38:14.698
Guy you killed for no reason?

38:14.700 --> 38:17.150
Oh, you think I didn't
know about that?

38:17.152 --> 38:18.152
Huh?

38:18.153 --> 38:19.653
No, I knew that
was you all along,

38:19.655 --> 38:20.570
yet said nothing.

38:20.572 --> 38:23.690
"No reason"?

38:23.692 --> 38:26.159
Guy was messing
with my business.

38:26.161 --> 38:28.829
I did what <i> had</i> to be done.

38:29.581 --> 38:31.281
In fact, if you
think about it,

38:31.283 --> 38:34.501
you're the reason
that he's dead.

38:36.121 --> 38:38.505
You got him killed.

38:39.641 --> 38:41.091
So, what,
now you think

38:41.093 --> 38:43.093
that your silence
is worth something?

38:43.095 --> 38:44.428
Like a job?

38:44.430 --> 38:46.263
I don't know.
Maybe you could

38:46.265 --> 38:47.931
sweep up
the place...

38:47.933 --> 38:49.232
Let's go! Go, go, go!

38:53.489 --> 38:55.906
That man was
the only person

38:55.908 --> 38:58.108
that ever gave
a damn about me!

38:59.078 --> 39:00.444
You son of
a bitch.

39:00.446 --> 39:02.829
He saw something
good in me.

39:02.831 --> 39:04.498
Thought I could do better!

39:04.500 --> 39:06.366
He had a little girl!

39:06.368 --> 39:08.869
Sit down. Sit!
I got him.

39:08.871 --> 39:10.287
Get down on the ground!

39:10.289 --> 39:11.421
Get down.
On the floor!

39:11.423 --> 39:13.206
On the floor! Got it!

39:27.806 --> 39:29.055
We need a paramedic.

39:29.057 --> 39:30.557
Somebody get me
a paramedic.

39:30.559 --> 39:32.109
Call a paramedic.

39:40.068 --> 39:41.234
I'm sorry.

39:42.871 --> 39:44.988
Couldn't
help myself.

40:39.011 --> 40:41.344
Hey, Steve...

40:41.346 --> 40:43.430
You hand me
that wrench?

40:51.190 --> 40:54.057
Thanks, buddy.

40:54.059 --> 40:55.275
Ah...

40:57.813 --> 40:59.112
All right.

41:00.949 --> 41:03.233
Okay...

41:03.235 --> 41:06.036
Hey, I'm gonna
hold that one...

41:06.038 --> 41:08.238
See that?

41:09.608 --> 41:11.541
All right.

41:11.543 --> 41:13.743
Nice work.

41:38.103 --> 41:39.469
You need a hand?

41:42.491 --> 41:43.473
Hey!

41:43.475 --> 41:45.475
Hey.

41:45.477 --> 41:47.711
I was just on my way
to the hospital to see Jordan,

41:47.713 --> 41:49.746
but I wanted to
stop by first

41:49.748 --> 41:51.331
and say thank you.

41:51.333 --> 41:52.515
In person.

41:52.517 --> 41:55.919
You're welcome.

41:57.172 --> 42:00.173
You, uh, having some trouble
with your differential?

42:02.878 --> 42:04.210
Yes, I am, actually.

42:04.212 --> 42:06.463
I just put new gaskets
and seals in,

42:06.465 --> 42:07.514
but she's still
running rough.

42:07.516 --> 42:08.548
Try new bearings

42:08.550 --> 42:10.183
and thrust washers,
that should fix it.

42:10.185 --> 42:12.052
You know something about cars?

42:12.054 --> 42:13.937
No, not really.

42:13.939 --> 42:16.222
I know a few things
about this car, though.

42:16.224 --> 42:18.808
Actually, I rode in it
a couple of times.

42:18.810 --> 42:21.194
Your dad loved
to talk about this car.

42:21.196 --> 42:22.862
Yeah, he certainly did.

42:24.149 --> 42:25.149
He did.

42:25.150 --> 42:26.199
Hey, I appreciate the tip.

42:26.201 --> 42:27.201
Oh, happy to help.

42:27.202 --> 42:28.451
Let me ask you a question:

42:28.453 --> 42:30.236
Do you know how to fix
the intake manifold leak?

42:30.238 --> 42:32.289
Because that one has been
stumping me for years.

42:32.291 --> 42:33.540
Sorry.

42:33.542 --> 42:35.075
I wish I did.
Okay.

42:35.077 --> 42:36.409
That's okay.

42:36.411 --> 42:38.628
I'll figure it out
one of these days.

42:43.168 --> 42:45.418
I should really get going.

42:45.420 --> 42:47.587
Yeah, yeah, sure.

42:47.589 --> 42:49.756
Of course.
Yeah.

42:49.758 --> 42:51.591
Uh, am I gonna see you

42:51.593 --> 42:53.259
at the National Memorial next year?
Yeah.

42:53.261 --> 42:54.894
I'll be there.

42:54.896 --> 42:56.012
All right.

42:57.399 --> 42:58.648
Hope it won't be that long

42:58.650 --> 43:00.600
before we see each other
again, though.

43:02.354 --> 43:03.269
Me, too.

43:28.096 --> 43:29.779
Hello, Mr. Ortega.

43:29.781 --> 43:30.964
What are you doing here?

43:30.966 --> 43:33.016
Returning your book.

43:34.386 --> 43:35.719
Did you ever read it?

43:36.555 --> 43:37.887
No?

43:37.889 --> 43:39.806
There's a passage in here

43:39.808 --> 43:41.141
that warns of the perils

43:41.143 --> 43:44.144
of meddling in
someone else's affairs.

43:44.146 --> 43:48.064
"He who does
will face retribution."
