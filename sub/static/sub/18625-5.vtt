[all]
Waka chaka!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.209
[laughs]

02:53.298 --> 02:54.883
Always be afraid.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.636
Fear heightens your senses.
Fear keeps you alive.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.553
[screams]

02:58.637 --> 03:00.514
Arrogance gets you killed.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.557
[groans]
Yeah, I'll have to remember that.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.935
Draal, however, does not fear you.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.270
That will be his weakness, but not you.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.148
You'll be wetting your armor.
That will be your strength.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.316
[grunting]

03:11.400 --> 03:15.112
Oh, yeah. Looking good, Jimbo.
Feel the burn!

03:15.195 --> 03:17.197
-If Jim's getting fit, I'm getting fit.
-[tracker beeps]

03:17.280 --> 03:19.408
-Don't want to be too big.
-[moans]

03:20.117 --> 03:21.743
Not that there's anything wrong
with being big.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.121
But if I'm gonna have Jim's back,
I gotta be nimble.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.081
[moans]

03:26.998 --> 03:29.918
[grunting]

03:30.001 --> 03:33.880
Yeah, baby! Hit a benchmark.
I've run a total of... a hundred feet.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.174
Five calories burned. Nice!

03:36.258 --> 03:37.592
[grunting]

03:38.677 --> 03:41.638
You know, I think being afraid
is the one rule that I-- Oh!

03:42.180 --> 03:43.223
[screams]

03:43.849 --> 03:45.183
[chuckles]
...I excel at.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.227
No, Master Jim.
You must excel at all three.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.396
If trolls are ever going
to embrace you as Trollhunter,

03:49.479 --> 03:51.523
you must ignore your humanly instincts.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.691
[grunts]

03:53.275 --> 03:56.945
Do that, and I have no doubt
you will defeat Draal.

03:57.028 --> 04:01.408
[Draal laughing]

04:01.491 --> 04:05.078
Look... it's training.
[growls]

04:05.162 --> 04:07.164
Cute.
[laughs]

04:07.247 --> 04:09.833
[Draal speaks troll language]

04:09.916 --> 04:13.587
Let your fear keep you alive.
Let his arrogance lead him astray.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.214
Defeat him... and you'll make history.

04:17.716 --> 04:21.762
I know contemporary media
might lead you to believe

04:21.845 --> 04:27.017
European history is full
of swords, sorcery, and scandal.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.188
I assure you,
the truth is far more interesting,

04:31.271 --> 04:35.692
and there's no better place to start
than Renaissance Era pottery.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.111
Since we have limited time, Ms. Nomura,

04:38.195 --> 04:41.364
perhaps it's best if they explore
the museum on their own.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.074
-Don't you think?
-[Claire] See ya!

04:43.158 --> 04:46.912
So, check this out, man. So, If I walk
fifty thousand steps, I get the t-shirt.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.790
A hundred thousand
nets me the water bottle.

04:49.873 --> 04:53.585
But if I get five hundred thousand--
oh, man, you guys--

04:53.668 --> 04:55.837
that's when things get interesting!

04:55.921 --> 04:56.880
[chuckles]

04:56.963 --> 04:58.673
Look at that embroidery.

04:58.757 --> 05:02.469
Hey, sorry if you got caught up
in that little tiff between Lake and I,

05:02.552 --> 05:05.722
but I want you to know,
since joining the play,

05:05.806 --> 05:08.934
I feel like there's another side of me
that really wants to come out.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.603
Apology accepted. You were a jerk.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.192
-[moaning, kissing]
-[sighs]

05:17.275 --> 05:19.569
Aw, come on, man.
Don't let Steve get to you.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.738
Claire's a smart girl.
She'll realize he's a jerk.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.784
How? She's too busy thinking I'm a jerk
for skipping play rehearsal.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.786
Well, then,
this is the perfect moment, dude.

05:27.869 --> 05:31.331
Take her hand and use those
lips of yours and talk to her.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.458
Toby, no, no! Wait, wait!

05:34.042 --> 05:36.962
Hey, Steve! Did you hear
about the Neanderthal exhibit?

05:37.045 --> 05:40.966
-Topless.
-Nice! Cave ladies.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.968
Come here, come here.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.014
[chuckles]
I wish our play had these costumes.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.183
I know, right?
With our school budget,

05:50.267 --> 05:52.561
I'll end up doing the balcony scene
in my bathrobe.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.480
Hey, if anyone could pull it off,
it'd be you.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.483
You're the only one on stage who looks
like they know what they're doing.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.734
Tell that to my parents.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.321
The one time I get a B,
what's their advice? Drop the play.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.699
Are they crazy?
You were born for this. It's like--

06:05.782 --> 06:07.242
Get closer.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.535
...your calling.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.455
My mom would be stoked if I ever found
something to be so passionate about.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.668
Wow! You're pretty passionate yourself,
Mr. Guru. What about you?

06:16.751 --> 06:20.046
-What's calling you, Jim Lake Junior?
-[clears throat]

06:20.130 --> 06:24.134
[Eli] At first, I thought it was an alien.
Definitely not human.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.761
-It's some sort of monster!
-Come on, give it up, Eli.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.723
No, no! This time,
I have photographic evidence.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.766
[gasps]
Hey, Eli, can I see your phone real quick?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.935
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.147
-Oh, darn!
-What the heck? You deleted it?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.024
[chuckles]
Darn these stubby little fingers.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.735
-If it's any consolation, I believed you.
-[tracker beeps]

06:41.818 --> 06:45.864
-Believing, one calorie.
-[Claire] Hey, so I've gotta ask...

06:45.947 --> 06:48.908
If you weren't going to show up
for rehearsals, why even try out?

06:48.992 --> 06:55.290
Honestly, I kind of auditioned
by accident, but I'm glad I did.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.501
-I really liked the company.
-Aw! [chuckles] Thanks.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.338
Um, I was talking about Eli.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.131
[laughs]

07:03.214 --> 07:04.424
[clears throat]

07:04.507 --> 07:07.010
-This better be good, Tobes.
-It's actually kind of bad.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.679
-We have a problem.
-What kind of problem?

07:10.639 --> 07:14.309
-[Toby] Voila!
-[Aaarrrgghh] Not voila. Goblin.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.312
-Goblin?
-Ruthless tricksters.

07:17.395 --> 07:21.274
Petty street vandals who leave
a wake of destruction. This is not good.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.486
Well, justice was served.
We should get back and train for Draal.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.905
Oh, no, Master Jim.
Where there is one, there is many.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.616
And, as for the unfortunate soul
who ran over this small fellow,

07:29.699 --> 07:32.911
may Skaargen's swift blade have mercy!

07:34.454 --> 07:37.832
-And why is that?
-Naturally, goblin payback is ten-fold.

07:37.916 --> 07:41.169
Are you saying whoever ran this guy over
is in serious trouble?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.005
[Toby] A delivery driver left
a sticky note on Eli's house.

07:44.089 --> 07:48.301
Wait for it. The goblin might have
gotten squashed by the delivery truck!

07:48.385 --> 07:50.095
Hey, let me see that.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.473
If the driver's returning at eight,
we need to be here, too.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.227
I'm not gonna let some poor guy
become goblin chow on my watch.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.854
Master Jim, answering the call!

07:59.938 --> 08:03.942
So cool. Stakeout!
[chuckles] Past my curfew!

08:05.860 --> 08:08.029
[growls]
It's already nine o'clock. Ugh.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.991
It appears the only thing being delivered
is failed expectations.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.995
At least, no sign of goblins. Hey, Tobes,
all clear. How's it going over there?

08:15.078 --> 08:18.123
All good in the hood, Trollhunter,
except I can't stop moving.

08:18.206 --> 08:22.127
My love of stakeouts is being ruined
by my overwhelming need to obtain swag.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.506
-Other than that, nothing unusual.
-You are unusual.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.216
War Hammer out.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.970
War Hammer to Trollhunter,
the package has arrived.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.433
[humming]

08:36.515 --> 08:37.933
-[grunts] Whoa!
-[object shatters]

08:38.018 --> 08:39.602
Let's get him out of here
before it's too late.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.272
Wait! His fate may already be sealed.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.357
They're here. Look!

08:45.233 --> 08:46.359
[speaking goblin language]

08:46.443 --> 08:48.820
No, I'm not gonna let
an innocent person--

08:48.903 --> 08:51.698
Great trouble! There appears
to be far more than I had anticipated.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.451
<i>Stay down and don't make a sound.</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:58.079
<i>In their frenzied state,</i>
<i>they'll attack any in their path.</i>

08:58.163 --> 08:59.372
-[mimicking music]
-[doorbell rings]

08:59.456 --> 09:00.457
-Oh!
-[object shatters]

09:00.540 --> 09:02.917
Oops!
[humming]

09:03.001 --> 09:05.712
Yes! My spy gear has arrived!

09:05.795 --> 09:08.173
-[pieces clattering]
-Unassembled!

09:08.256 --> 09:10.592
Hey, mind if I use your can?
Rad. Thanks.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.260
[goblin laughing]

09:12.886 --> 09:17.057
-But that's Eli! He's in my class.
-He <i>was</i> in your class.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.392
[goblin muttering]

09:20.226 --> 09:21.895
[goblins yelling]

09:21.978 --> 09:24.355
[snarling, growling]

09:30.153 --> 09:32.197
[goblins chanting]
Waka chaka...

09:32.280 --> 09:34.282
Waka-chaka-wa!

09:37.744 --> 09:39.537
Oh, my goblins!

09:39.621 --> 09:40.622
[Blinky]
<i>Unexpected.</i>

09:40.705 --> 09:42.832
<i>Their dispute isn't</i>
<i>with the driver at all,</i>

09:42.916 --> 09:45.668
but rather the transportation
that had flattened their kinsman.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.462
Ooh, you must not be afraid, Master Jim.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.757
I thought the first rule of trollhunting
was to always be afraid.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.384
Trolls, not goblins.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.720
Goblins crave the pheromone of terror,

09:55.804 --> 09:58.348
an odor you appear to be releasing
quite generously.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.726
Wait! This is too much.
You mean, they can smell fear? [sniffs]

10:01.810 --> 10:06.439
-Oh, no! I can smell it, too.
-Then stop, or they will eat you!

10:06.523 --> 10:07.649
[Toby screams]

10:07.732 --> 10:11.694
[sniffing]

10:11.778 --> 10:12.695
[snarls]

10:12.779 --> 10:15.698
Perhaps I made my point too loud. Run!

10:16.658 --> 10:18.576
[goblins snarling]

10:18.660 --> 10:20.703
[grunting, panting]

10:23.706 --> 10:26.000
Whoa... Where's my truck?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.795
-[both panting]
-[goblins snarling]

10:31.214 --> 10:34.342
-[screams]
-Now is not the time for armor!

10:34.425 --> 10:36.845
-It'll only slow you down!
-You think I'm trying to do this?

10:36.928 --> 10:39.889
Your armor is responding
to your emotional state!

10:39.973 --> 10:42.600
Control your fear, or you'll be dinner!

10:42.684 --> 10:44.602
It's so, so heavy!

10:44.686 --> 10:46.688
-[gasps]
-Master Jim!

10:48.857 --> 10:50.441
[roars]

10:50.525 --> 10:52.193
[panting]

10:52.277 --> 10:53.278
[moans]

10:58.575 --> 11:01.244
-[tracker beeps]
-Oh, my gosh! I just got a free t-shirt!

11:01.327 --> 11:04.038
-This is so much cardio!
-[screams]

11:04.122 --> 11:06.833
[screams]
Get it off, get it off, get it off!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.168
No! My points!

11:08.251 --> 11:10.670
Your points? Our lives, Tobes!

11:13.339 --> 11:14.632
-[tracker beeps]
-[growls]

11:14.716 --> 11:18.094
We need to find a refuge!
Trollmarket's too far.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.889
Cut through these backyards. We'll get
to my house. Come on, come on, come on!

11:20.972 --> 11:23.683
-Waka chaka!
-[goblins snarling]

11:24.475 --> 11:25.560
Up and over.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.728
[grunts]

11:30.398 --> 11:33.443
-Uh...
-[goblins snarling]

11:34.235 --> 11:36.571
-Come on, come on! Hurry, Tobes!
-Don't rush me!

11:36.654 --> 11:38.281
-[moans]
-Oh, no.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.579
Ah! I did it! Yes! I rule, I rule!

11:45.371 --> 11:46.831
Uh-oh.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.627
[all screaming]

11:53.796 --> 11:56.090
Thank gosh for Nana's anti-burglar mania.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.800
-[growls]
-[tracker beeps]

11:57.884 --> 11:59.802
Wa-cha-ka!

11:59.886 --> 12:02.138
[breathing heavily]

12:02.221 --> 12:04.474
[Nana]
Toby-pie! Is that you?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.769
Don't mind us, Nana.
We'll just be in my room.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.730
Binge-watch another show
and keep the cats inside.

12:13.942 --> 12:17.695
Any-- Anyone else want a snack?
I find stress eating calms me down.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.741
I'm sorry to say, Master Jim,
but your town is infested with goblins!

12:21.824 --> 12:24.994
Okay, trolls, I can deal with because,
at least, trolls stay underground.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.914
But goblins?
I don't even have the bandwidth to--

12:27.997 --> 12:29.582
Jim, we gotta get
my Chubby Tracker back.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.293
As long as they've got it, they're just
gonna get stronger and faster.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.212
Must find den.

12:34.295 --> 12:38.633
Yes, and eradicate them at once
before they seek their revenge.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.884
Revenge?

12:39.968 --> 12:44.263
On you two. And they now know
where Tobias lives.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.724
So, we find their den.
You must have some idea.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.267
Haven't the foggiest.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.061
-It could be anywhere.
-[gnome chattering]

12:51.980 --> 12:57.402
Great Gronka Morka!
What is the gnome doing in this dollhouse?

12:57.485 --> 13:01.447
[Nana] Toby-pie? I don't recognize
that voice. Who is that?

13:01.531 --> 13:03.866
It's a friend, Nana!
I do have more than one!

13:03.950 --> 13:05.284
[Nana]
No, you don't.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.246
You told me to take care of the gnome,
so we're taking care of it.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.958
This is in direct violation
of rule number two!

13:12.041 --> 13:13.459
Whatever happened
to finishing the fight?

13:13.543 --> 13:15.545
And rule number one is
to always be afraid,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.006
except if you're around goblins
'cause they smell fear.

13:18.089 --> 13:22.885
Your rules make less sense than algebra,
which-- oh, yeah-- I have in a few hours,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.430
unless I get eaten by goblins tonight.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.515
-[gnome chatters]
-I'm sorry.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.642
I'm no good at understanding your rules.

13:29.726 --> 13:35.273
I'm not ready for Draal, Bular,
or finding a stupid den of goblins.

13:36.190 --> 13:40.028
As your trainer, I can only advise,
not make your decisions.

13:40.111 --> 13:44.449
I understand. You're human.
You're learning the rules in your own way.

13:44.532 --> 13:48.077
Aaarrrgghh and I will seek out this den,
wherever it may be.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.579
You just focus on your studies.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.790
It seems life has thrown
enough at you for one day.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.418
But a gnome in a dollhouse?

13:57.128 --> 13:59.881
-[boy] Oh, yes!
-Dodge this, Lake!

14:02.258 --> 14:04.510
Hey, come on! You gonna get
your head in the game, Tobes,

14:04.594 --> 14:06.095
or do I have to do this all myself?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.098
Why bother taking another step?
My Chubby Tracker's gone.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.893
Life's so empty
when you're not racking up points.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.689
Well, I thought you'd be more concerned
about the goblins coming to kill us.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.733
-Oh, yeah, you're right.
-[grunts]

14:19.525 --> 14:20.401
[grunting]

14:20.485 --> 14:21.944
[yelping]

14:22.528 --> 14:24.614
-[girl] Come on!
-[boy] Keep your eyes open!

14:24.697 --> 14:25.573
[girl]
Oh, nice!

14:27.116 --> 14:27.950
[growls]

14:28.534 --> 14:29.911
At least your training's paying off.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.496
[groans]
Man down.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.875
[in high-pitched voice]
My gronk-nuks!

14:35.958 --> 14:38.461
In your face! You're out, Domzalski!

14:44.717 --> 14:45.676
[chuckles]

14:47.970 --> 14:52.934
Pretty good, Romeo,
but kiss your Juliet goodbye.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.060
[moaning]

14:54.143 --> 14:56.979
-Leave Claire out of this.
-Don't let him get to you--

14:57.397 --> 15:01.526
-Ow! Seriously?
-Pucker up, Steve, and kiss this!

15:02.276 --> 15:03.528
[in slow-motion]
Whoa!

15:06.030 --> 15:07.532
[in slow-motion]
No!

15:07.615 --> 15:11.702
[in slow-motion]
Oh, snap!

15:11.786 --> 15:13.704
-[screams, groans]
-[whistle blows]

15:15.456 --> 15:18.709
Ooh, headshot! Shake it off, Nuñez!

15:18.793 --> 15:21.879
So, she has a fat lip. People pay
good money for that sort of look.

15:21.963 --> 15:25.883
-She should thank you.
-And just when I was making up ground.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.553
Why do I have to get
so worked up over her?

15:28.636 --> 15:29.971
Hey, we're red-blooded teenagers.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.765
We're powerless to that sort of thing.
Except for me, though.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.393
-[phone vibrating]
-I got it all figured out. Hmm? Whoa!

15:35.476 --> 15:38.521
-I earned a windbreaker!
-Toby, do you know what this means?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.691
Yeah. If it's not too warm
and not too cold,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.401
I have the perfect cover-up!

15:43.484 --> 15:47.363
No. A goblin must have
the Chubby Tracker on him!

15:47.447 --> 15:49.824
We know where they're going.
This could lead us straight to their den.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.826
And I'm getting a lot of points.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.455
Shouldn't we be telling
Blinky and Aaarrrgghh?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.373
By the time we get down to Trollmarket,

15:57.457 --> 16:01.043
the Chubby Tracker battery could be dead,
and then we'll never find the goblin den.

16:01.127 --> 16:05.173
Besides, we're just gonna scope it out
and then report back. Easy.

16:06.424 --> 16:10.720
Hey, look! Look over there.
The museum. We should have known.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.763
-Let's go tell the others.
-[gasps] Get down!

16:14.390 --> 16:17.810
-[Jim] It's the museum lady.
-She has no idea it's infested.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.356
At any moment, they could strike!
Or worse... lay eggs in her ears.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.650
I don't think goblins do that.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.944
Anyway, we need to get her
out of there immediately.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.779
Good idea, but cover your ears.

16:32.450 --> 16:36.454
Come on, open up. Hello? Hello?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.331
Where'd she go?
Why isn't she answering?

16:38.414 --> 16:39.665
'Cause she's already dead, Jim.

16:39.749 --> 16:43.211
Or she can't hear because
she already has eggs in her ears!

16:43.294 --> 16:46.297
-We gotta get in there.
-What? You have to speak louder.

16:50.301 --> 16:54.722
-This is breaking and entering.
-No, it's-it's breaking and rescuing.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.849
Relax. We're just gonna get her
out of there,

16:56.933 --> 17:00.019
and then let Blinky and Aaarrrgghh
handle the rest.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.358
[grunting]

17:05.441 --> 17:06.567
[chuckles]

17:08.361 --> 17:09.862
[grunting]

17:09.945 --> 17:10.905
[groans]

17:10.988 --> 17:14.450
Jeez, this place gives me the creeps
with the lights out.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.244
It was better when you could see
the Neanderthals.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.124
[goblins snoring]

17:22.208 --> 17:25.752
[snoring continues]

17:27.338 --> 17:28.673
Ugh!

17:35.388 --> 17:36.931
[classical music playing]

17:37.014 --> 17:38.891
-[gasps]
-[yelps]

17:38.975 --> 17:42.478
Okay, what do we say? If we scare her,
the goblins might find us.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.398
How about we're art lovers and we just
couldn't wait to see the new exhibits?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.858
-We're from the gas company.
-[objects clattering]

17:47.942 --> 17:50.778
-The door was open and we smelled a leak.
-[humming]

17:52.113 --> 17:55.908

-[screams]
-[sniffing]

18:01.622 --> 18:03.416
-[whimpering]
-No, no, that won't work.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.876
-We don't have the uniforms for that.
-[stammering]

18:05.960 --> 18:08.504
-Hey, what's with you?
-[stammering] The face...

18:08.588 --> 18:10.590
Chill out, Tobes.
You're gonna wake the goblins.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.093
[snoring]

18:14.176 --> 18:15.928
[sniffing]

18:16.012 --> 18:18.973
[stammering]
Her fa... the face... it's so ugly!

18:19.056 --> 18:22.893
Okay, okay. So, she's not your type.
You don't have to be rude about it.

18:22.977 --> 18:27.398

18:27.481 --> 18:28.441

-[whimpering]

18:35.865 --> 18:38.492
-You're gonna draw them to us.
-She's a monster, Jim!

18:38.576 --> 18:40.786
I saw her face! It wasn't natural!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.538
-She's, like, some sort of troll--
-What?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.416
...but one of us.
Like a weird half-breed thing, man.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.585
-Maybe it was just the lighting.
-The lighting?

18:57.595 --> 18:59.805
-[sighs]
-[phone vibrating]

18:59.889 --> 19:01.724
-[gasps]

19:01.807 --> 19:04.727
-Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off!
-I'm trying, I'm trying!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.854
-But I won the cooler.
-[cackling]

19:06.937 --> 19:09.523
I knew I detected the stink
of teenage flesh.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.276

19:12.360 --> 19:16.489
-[yelps]
-But a human Trollhunter...

19:16.572 --> 19:19.617
that I've never tasted.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.743
[hisses]

19:20.826 --> 19:22.870
Then let's see
how you like the taste of Daylight.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.705
That was a good one, Jimbo!

Give it. These points are mine.

Holy-- What the--? Her face! Did you--?

21:51.602 --> 21:54.772
And that bridge!
There were troll markings on it.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.983
Bridge? Who cares?
There's a shapeshifting troll witch!

21:58.067 --> 22:00.110
-They're walking among us, Tobes!
-[siren blaring]

22:00.194 --> 22:02.947
