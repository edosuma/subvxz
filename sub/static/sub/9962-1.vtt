01:10.000 --> 01:11.297
Moorgate Passage.

01:20.310 --> 01:22.437
Moorgate Passage.

01:25.082 --> 01:26.310
I see it over there!

01:32.451 --> 01:35.614
Bleeding rat-wags!
What's gotten into them?

01:43.696 --> 01:46.665
What in God's name is that?

01:50.803 --> 01:51.861
Halt!

01:56.342 --> 01:57.434
Halt!

01:59.345 --> 02:02.371
- Blimey!
- Stop!

02:02.781 --> 02:03.975
- Come on!
- Halt!

02:04.283 --> 02:05.807
In the name of the law!

02:07.886 --> 02:11.323
- Halt!
- How the hell do we stop this thing?

02:11.323 --> 02:13.951
I said, halt!

02:58.404 --> 02:59.428
Here.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.266
Careful, mates. Careful.

03:07.913 --> 03:09.278
There's men inside!

03:30.903 --> 03:32.393
Please.

04:03.268 --> 04:05.930
Bring the scientist with us.
Kill any who resist.

04:08.307 --> 04:09.968
Do we have him?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.337
Draper at your service, sir.

04:14.613 --> 04:19.414
The world, Herr Draper.
I want the world.

04:25.958 --> 04:28.825
Really?
That's so frightening.

05:50.709 --> 05:53.701
Don't wander off.

06:10.228 --> 06:12.719
Where's Quatermain?

06:13.865 --> 06:16.595
That gentleman at the back.

06:27.913 --> 06:32.213
Do I have the pleasure of addressing
Allan Quatermain?

06:33.251 --> 06:37.222
Yes, you do, sir. Indeed you do.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.986
You're not what I expected.

06:40.325 --> 06:42.293
I presume you're another traveler...

06:42.461 --> 06:45.487
...got it in your head
to sample the Dark Continent.

06:45.731 --> 06:49.223
And while you're at it,
hunt down old Allan Quatermain...

06:49.401 --> 06:51.869
...and have him tell his adventures.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.635
- Well...
- You just fill a seat, sir.

06:55.807 --> 06:59.436
You can fill my glass.
Bruce, double.

07:03.448 --> 07:07.782
I'll regale you with how I found King
Solomon's Mines, or I could relate my...

07:07.953 --> 07:11.252
It is not your past that interests me.

07:11.423 --> 07:13.516
My name is Sanderson Reed.

07:13.692 --> 07:17.355
I am a representative
of Her Majesty's British government.

07:17.529 --> 07:19.292
The empire needs you.

07:20.198 --> 07:22.200
But the question is...

07:22.200 --> 07:24.327
...do I need the empire?

07:25.470 --> 07:27.870
Perhaps I should toddle off.
Should l, Allan?

07:28.206 --> 07:30.299
Yes, of course, Nigel, you toddle off.

07:30.842 --> 07:32.207
Toddling.

07:32.411 --> 07:37.678
Nigel is useful for keeping
the story seekers at bay.

07:37.849 --> 07:39.840
I'm Quatermain.

07:40.018 --> 07:42.851
The empire is in peril.

07:44.222 --> 07:49.319
You're probably too young to know,
but the empire is always in some peril.

07:49.494 --> 07:53.396
We need you to lead a team
of unique men like yourself...

07:53.565 --> 07:56.500
...to combat this threat.

07:58.704 --> 08:00.535
Regale me.

08:00.706 --> 08:05.734
There is great unrest, countries set at
each other's throats, baying for blood.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.744
The trouble of which I speak could
set a match to the whole thing. War.

08:10.582 --> 08:13.983
- With whom, exactly?
- Everyone.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.219
A world war.

08:16.955 --> 08:21.654
- That notion makes you sweat?
- Heavens, man, doesn't it you?

08:21.827 --> 08:24.262
This is Africa, dear boy.

08:24.262 --> 08:26.890
Sweating is what we do.

08:27.566 --> 08:30.330
Where is your sense of patriotism?

08:31.269 --> 08:33.567
God save the queen.

08:33.739 --> 08:36.731
- God save the queen. God bless her.
- God save the queen.

08:37.275 --> 08:40.005
That's about as patriotic
as it gets around here.

08:40.378 --> 08:42.437
But you're Allan Quatermain.

08:42.614 --> 08:46.880
Stories of your exploits have thrilled
English boys for decades.

08:47.219 --> 08:53.215
That I know, and Nigel has done
a grand job reminding me.

08:53.558 --> 08:58.363
But with each past exploit...

08:58.363 --> 09:02.300
...l've lost friends.
White men and black...

09:02.300 --> 09:04.734
...and much more.

09:05.237 --> 09:08.434
And I am not the man I once was.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.738
The gentleman over there.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.644
- We're in for the long haul.
- Exactly.

09:14.813 --> 09:17.213
- Mr. Quatermain?
- Why, yes indeed, sir.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.223
Wrong Quatermain.

09:25.223 --> 09:26.417
That's him.

09:29.628 --> 09:30.925
Get down!

09:31.763 --> 09:35.597
- They're indestructible.
- No, just armor-plated.

09:48.613 --> 09:51.946
Automatic rifles? Who in God's name
has automatic rifles?

09:52.284 --> 09:55.276
That's unsporting. Probably Belgium.

10:18.844 --> 10:20.311
Allan!

10:35.293 --> 10:36.954
Wicked waste.

10:38.396 --> 10:39.829
Look out!

11:04.723 --> 11:07.248
Good old Britannia.

11:07.993 --> 11:10.223
Wasn't there another one
of these buggers?

11:10.395 --> 11:11.419
Mr. Quatermain!

11:13.865 --> 11:15.765
Bruce, Matilda.

11:18.336 --> 11:21.567
Our friend might have some information.

11:23.942 --> 11:27.378
But he's so far away.

11:28.446 --> 11:30.641
Yes, I thought he was.

11:31.883 --> 11:35.250
God, I hate getting old.

11:46.264 --> 11:49.563
- Did you mean to just wound him?
- Obviously.

11:52.871 --> 11:56.568
Stop him! I need information!

12:02.414 --> 12:04.382
Bloody poison.

12:06.551 --> 12:10.988
You may have no love for the empire,
but I know you love Africa.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.348
A war in Europe will spread
to its colonies.

12:24.970 --> 12:28.269
It appears the war has arrived.

12:29.274 --> 12:31.640
very well, Reed...

12:31.910 --> 12:34.003
...l'm in.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.845
Excellent.

12:37.015 --> 12:39.950
Pack for an English summer.

13:43.381 --> 13:45.008
You made good time getting here.

13:45.350 --> 13:50.344
Not as good as Phileas Fogg,
Around the World in 80 Days.

14:13.278 --> 14:15.610
Where are we going, Australia?

14:23.955 --> 14:26.890
And here we are, sir.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.870
I don't like theatrics.

14:49.027 --> 14:54.761
After Africa's veldts, London's weather
isn't helping your mood, I see.

14:54.933 --> 14:57.026
Identify yourself.

14:57.335 --> 15:00.371
I'm known by many names,
Mr. Quatermain.

15:00.371 --> 15:04.364
My underlings call me sir.
My superiors call me M.

15:04.976 --> 15:06.568
M?

15:06.878 --> 15:08.903
Just M.

15:09.881 --> 15:14.250
I must say, the delight is mine,
meeting so notable a recruit...

15:14.419 --> 15:18.583
...to this newest generation of the
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

15:18.756 --> 15:19.882
League of what?

15:20.325 --> 15:22.987
There have been times
when a danger upon the world...

15:23.328 --> 15:26.957
...required the services
of singular individuals.

15:27.298 --> 15:29.289
How very curious.

15:31.302 --> 15:33.270
This museum is full of the curious.

15:33.304 --> 15:36.241
Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo.

15:36.241 --> 15:39.301
I know of Mr. Quatermain.

15:39.377 --> 15:41.777
And I know of you, captain.

15:41.946 --> 15:44.642
Rumor has it that you're a pirate.

15:44.816 --> 15:47.751
I'd prefer a less provocative title.

15:47.919 --> 15:50.649
- I'm sure you would.
- Gentlemen, please.

15:50.822 --> 15:53.258
Nations are striking at nations.

15:53.258 --> 15:56.694
Every attack marked by the use
of highly advanced weaponry.

15:57.328 --> 15:59.762
These attacks
are all the work of one man...

15:59.931 --> 16:04.664
...who calls himself the Fantom.
- Very operatic. What's in it for him?

16:04.836 --> 16:06.304
Profit.

16:06.304 --> 16:11.264
Those machines are his creations, the
work of scientists he holds imprisoned.

16:11.442 --> 16:15.280
His attacks have nations clamoring
for the weapons that assail them.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.273
- Then it's a race for arms.
- And millions will perish.

16:21.286 --> 16:24.619
There's one last chance to avert war.

16:24.789 --> 16:28.326
The leaders of Europe
are to meet secretly in venice.

16:28.326 --> 16:32.695
And you believe that this Fantom
will attack that conference?

16:32.864 --> 16:34.232
If he can find it.

16:34.232 --> 16:38.669
We need a team to stop him in venice.
This team consists of six members.

16:38.836 --> 16:42.966
- You'll have four days.
- Four days to get to venice?

16:43.308 --> 16:45.742
- It's impossible.
- Let me worry about that.

16:48.313 --> 16:51.544
Well now,
extraordinary gentlemen indeed.

16:51.716 --> 16:53.445
One of them is late.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.843
- Harker, the chemist.
- Oh, chemist, eh?

16:58.022 --> 17:00.456
Do we get to blow something up then?

17:02.260 --> 17:04.694
My eyesight must be worse
than I thought.

17:04.862 --> 17:07.228
No, your eyesight's fine.

17:10.867 --> 17:13.233
No games, M.

17:13.570 --> 17:17.405
Some time ago, a talented,
albeit misguided, man of science...

17:17.575 --> 17:19.906
...discovered the means
to become invisible.

17:20.278 --> 17:25.215
- Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?
- Well, he did, but his process didn't.

17:25.215 --> 17:28.947
You see, I stole it,
and here I stand for all to see.

17:29.287 --> 17:32.279
- Is this some parlor game?
- Believe it.

17:33.558 --> 17:35.219
Easy now, Allan.

17:36.394 --> 17:39.295
I'm feeling a bit of a draft
in my nether regions.

17:39.497 --> 17:43.263
And I must say, it's quite refreshing.

17:43.434 --> 17:49.998
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rodney Skinner, gentleman thief.

17:50.808 --> 17:55.711
Now, I thought invisibility
would be a boon to my work.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.249
Well, you can imagine,
it was my undoing.

18:00.418 --> 18:04.718
Once you're invisible,
it's bloody hard to turn back.

18:04.889 --> 18:06.720
We finally caught him.

18:06.891 --> 18:10.827
And they'll provide an antidote.
Well, that's if I'm a good boy.

18:11.195 --> 18:12.594
And are you a good boy?

18:13.564 --> 18:17.625
I guess you'll find out, won't you?

18:21.906 --> 18:23.567
Am I late?

18:23.741 --> 18:26.177
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.

18:26.177 --> 18:30.409
Please tell me this is Harker's wife
with a sick note.

18:30.581 --> 18:35.416
Sick would be a mild understatement.
My husband's been dead for years.

18:35.586 --> 18:38.749
Gentlemen, Mrs. Wilhelmina Harker.

18:39.257 --> 18:43.193
Mina's prior acquaintance
with a reluctant League member...

18:43.361 --> 18:46.660
...may prove useful.
- I'm waiting to be impressed.

18:46.831 --> 18:50.995
The fate of the world is at stake.
There are two more members to recruit.

18:51.336 --> 18:54.772
- The clock hands turn, gentlemen.
- Kicking us out already?

18:54.939 --> 18:58.238
A moment ago,
it was sherry and giggles.

19:09.787 --> 19:15.226
- What in God's name is that?
- I call it an automobile.

19:15.226 --> 19:17.786
Yeah, but what is it?

19:17.962 --> 19:20.590
The future, gentlemen.

19:21.165 --> 19:23.395
The future.

19:24.469 --> 19:28.599
- This is my first mate.
- Call me Ishmael. Please.

19:57.335 --> 20:01.237
So how did M get you?

20:01.406 --> 20:02.896
None of your business.

20:05.009 --> 20:07.671
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.

20:07.845 --> 20:13.217
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure
danger the way I do.

20:13.217 --> 20:16.846
And I imagine you with quite the library,
Mr. Quatermain.

20:17.021 --> 20:20.752
All those books you must have read
merely by looking at their covers.

20:20.925 --> 20:26.297
I've had women along on past exploits
and found them to be, at best...

20:26.297 --> 20:29.596
...a distraction.
- Do I distract you?

20:29.767 --> 20:34.227
My dear girl, I've buried two wives
and many lovers...

20:34.405 --> 20:37.772
...and I'm in no mood
for more of either.

20:38.409 --> 20:42.607
- You can send them my way...
- Skinner, shut up.

21:24.755 --> 21:28.748
- Shall I wait, captain?
- No, bring my lady to me.

21:31.329 --> 21:33.797
This is a charming spot.

21:33.998 --> 21:36.660
Does Jack the Ripper live here?

21:47.745 --> 21:50.543
- Good evening.
- Mr. Dorian Gray?

21:50.982 --> 21:54.611
- I am indeed.
- We came by way of M.

21:56.787 --> 21:58.687
M for mystery.

21:59.524 --> 22:03.460
Well, I've told him and I'm telling you,
I'm not interested.

22:03.628 --> 22:05.289
Dorian.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.463
Mina?

22:20.878 --> 22:23.369
Charming dижcor.

22:23.781 --> 22:25.976
You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray.

22:26.317 --> 22:28.478
And you don't miss a thing,
do you?

22:28.653 --> 22:30.883
Oh, sometimes.

22:36.260 --> 22:37.989
Scotch, anyone?

22:38.329 --> 22:39.728
Please, help yourself.

22:39.897 --> 22:42.798
Don't let it ruin your makeup.

22:44.268 --> 22:49.035
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take
Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.

22:49.373 --> 22:53.707
Yes, well, I've seen too much
in my life to shock easily.

22:54.378 --> 22:58.382
Although, I must say
I was surprised to see you again.

22:58.382 --> 23:01.283
Well, our last parting
was such sweet sorrow.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.785
So you're nothing more
than an enticement.

23:05.957 --> 23:09.688
Nevertheless,
your presence intrigues me.

23:11.696 --> 23:14.358
They say you're indestructible,
Quatermain.

23:14.532 --> 23:18.400
Well, a witch doctor
did bless me once.

23:18.569 --> 23:21.231
I had saved his village.

23:21.539 --> 23:26.442
He said Africa
would never allow me to die.

23:26.611 --> 23:28.977
But you're not in Africa now.

23:29.747 --> 23:30.873
No.

23:31.215 --> 23:35.379
I confess a curiosity as to what
the files say about Mr. Gray.

23:35.886 --> 23:39.378
We, all of us, have traits useful
in this endeavor.

23:39.557 --> 23:44.893
A hunter, scientist,
even Skinner has stealth.

23:45.229 --> 23:47.493
- Cheers.
- What have you?

23:47.665 --> 23:50.234
I have experience.

23:50.234 --> 23:55.729
Gray and I have met before,
many years ago at Eton College.

23:55.906 --> 23:57.601
A lecture, no doubt.

23:57.775 --> 24:02.246
You, the nation's hero,
Dorian, the eager listening boy.

24:02.246 --> 24:03.975
Quite the reverse.

24:04.248 --> 24:07.308
It was Gray visiting Eton...

24:08.886 --> 24:10.649
...and I was the boy.

24:18.262 --> 24:19.194
What is it?

24:31.308 --> 24:33.538
- Gray?
- They are not mine.

24:33.711 --> 24:35.770
They're mine.

24:42.219 --> 24:45.711
First meetings usually
warrant introductions.

24:46.357 --> 24:50.350
Of course. I am the Fantom.

24:50.528 --> 24:57.366
You are the League of so-called
Extraordinary Gentlemen.

24:57.968 --> 24:59.731
Introductions made.

24:59.937 --> 25:05.898
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quatermain,
not blind.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.232
Drop the gun.

25:10.815 --> 25:15.479
Your mission is to stop me.
That, of course, I cannot permit.

25:15.653 --> 25:19.714
So I give to you all a special
one-time invitation.

25:20.691 --> 25:21.919
Join me.

25:22.259 --> 25:25.194
You think we'll help start a war
that will consume the planet?

25:25.362 --> 25:28.695
While you profit
from your arms race?

25:29.333 --> 25:33.827
I cannot deny that fortunes
are made in war.

25:34.238 --> 25:38.868
Imagine the riches
a world war will yield.

25:39.210 --> 25:42.236
- He's not wrong.
- Speak for yourself.

26:50.948 --> 26:52.813
Draw your pistol!

26:53.250 --> 26:55.912
I walk a different path.

27:11.802 --> 27:13.360
Run, James!

27:26.183 --> 27:27.445
Hang on.

27:34.992 --> 27:36.584
Night-night.

28:01.352 --> 28:02.614
Dorian!

28:18.302 --> 28:20.327
What are you?

28:20.504 --> 28:22.529
I'm complicated.

28:44.762 --> 28:46.320
Damn.

28:47.364 --> 28:51.630
I thought I was special.
You're invulnerable to harm.

28:51.802 --> 28:54.464
I don't like to boast.
What happened to Mina?

28:54.672 --> 28:57.800
Oh, she's probably hip-deep
in some sort of trouble.

28:57.975 --> 29:01.240
Don't be such an alarmist, Mr. Q.

29:01.412 --> 29:04.210
And my hips
are none of your business.

29:08.719 --> 29:09.743
Shoot!

29:10.421 --> 29:12.218
Go on!

29:17.328 --> 29:20.820
I guessed as much, that they
would do anything to protect you.

29:21.265 --> 29:24.496
See, now that's your biggest mistake.

29:25.235 --> 29:27.897
Thinking that I need them
to protect me.

29:45.189 --> 29:47.589
Extraordinary.

29:49.193 --> 29:53.254
Boy, they told me European women
had funny ways.

29:55.299 --> 29:56.766
You missed a spot.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.367
Excuse me.

30:03.307 --> 30:04.341
And you are?

30:04.341 --> 30:07.868
Special Agent Sawyer
of the American Secret Service.

30:08.212 --> 30:10.442
Then America is aware
of the situation?

30:10.614 --> 30:14.812
If war starts in Europe, how long
will it take until it crosses the Atlantic?

30:15.352 --> 30:19.448
I followed you. I knocked out a straggler,
and I took his place.

30:19.623 --> 30:24.651
very noble. But this is a private party,
and you're not invited.

30:25.029 --> 30:28.465
Actually, Dorian has declined...

30:28.866 --> 30:31.027
...so we are one shy of a full deck.

30:31.368 --> 30:35.566
On the contrary, the battle
was just the spur I needed.

30:35.773 --> 30:38.401
That and the thrill
of a friendship renewed.

30:41.045 --> 30:43.275
So you're not needed.

30:48.886 --> 30:50.751
- Winchester.
- That's right.

30:50.921 --> 30:54.413
- It's modified, American style.
- American-style shooting too.

30:55.492 --> 30:57.687
Well, whatever it takes.

30:59.063 --> 31:01.861
You like it, I brought two.

31:04.068 --> 31:06.195
You're in.

31:08.939 --> 31:13.210
- So, what's the next port of call?
- Paris.

31:13.210 --> 31:15.735
Just one last member to recruit.

31:15.913 --> 31:19.872
Capture is more the word,
and it will be quite a hunt.

31:20.217 --> 31:22.378
You make him sound like
some kind of animal.

31:22.686 --> 31:27.953
Oh, speaking thus, Mrs. Harker,
your conduct a moment ago...?

31:28.292 --> 31:33.355
Indeed. We are all aquiver
with curiosity.

31:35.732 --> 31:37.427
Well...

31:40.637 --> 31:43.606
My husband was Jonathan Harker.

31:43.841 --> 31:47.538
With a professor named van Helsing,
we fought a dangerous evil.

31:48.645 --> 31:53.378
It had a name, Dracula.
He was Transylvanian.

31:53.717 --> 31:55.480
European?

31:55.652 --> 31:59.611
One of those radicals the newspapers
love to report on?

31:59.790 --> 32:02.350
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.

32:05.362 --> 32:10.265
Is the vampiric sucking of people's
blood radical behavior?

32:19.243 --> 32:22.007
Our transportation is forthcoming.

32:22.346 --> 32:23.813
A boat?

32:24.381 --> 32:28.249
It travels on water,
if that's what you mean.

32:32.356 --> 32:35.655
And beneath it.

32:54.411 --> 33:00.407
Behold Nautilus,
the Sword of the Ocean.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.848
Next stop, Paris.

33:16.233 --> 33:18.963
I don't see what we need
a big monkey for.

33:19.336 --> 33:23.204
Well, this big monkey has terrorized
the Rue Morgue for months.

33:23.807 --> 33:27.243
Imagine the mayhem
he'll give the enemy.

33:32.849 --> 33:35.716
- You missed!
- I'm not trying to hit him.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.585
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.

33:46.530 --> 33:49.363
Make him turn left, boy.

33:53.503 --> 33:56.700
If you can't do it with one bullet,
don't do it at all.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.498
- He's doubled back.
- Precisely. Come on.

34:05.249 --> 34:06.580
Look out!

34:08.784 --> 34:10.547
That was naughty.

34:12.856 --> 34:16.223
- Thanks.
- Eyes open, boy.

34:16.592 --> 34:18.993
I can't protect you all the time.

34:22.699 --> 34:24.599
He's afraid.

34:25.235 --> 34:27.362
I can't smell anything.

35:00.337 --> 35:01.736
Perfect.

35:01.905 --> 35:04.430
Welcome aboard, Mr. Hyde.

35:13.250 --> 35:17.448
"This hunt's too dangerous for a woman,
even one such as you. Leave it to me."

35:24.494 --> 35:26.257
Good God.

35:35.605 --> 35:37.664
Hello, Dorian.

35:38.275 --> 35:41.608
The great white hunter's
bagged his prize.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.940
Or the prize bagged him.

35:49.386 --> 35:52.321
Stay back, if you value your life.

36:04.601 --> 36:07.502
- You scratched me.
- Better me than him.

36:10.707 --> 36:12.698
Well, this is nice.

36:14.211 --> 36:15.644
Mr. Hyde.

36:16.246 --> 36:18.407
You've done terrible things in England.

36:19.216 --> 36:23.175
So terrible that you fled the country.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.356
Now, I'm ashamed to say that
Her Majesty's government...

36:27.524 --> 36:31.585
...is willing to offer you amnesty...

36:31.762 --> 36:34.754
...in return for your services.

36:36.366 --> 36:38.527
Do you want to go home?

36:38.702 --> 36:40.761
Home?

36:41.204 --> 36:44.662
"Home's where the heart is,"
that's what they say.

36:44.841 --> 36:47.708
And I have been missing London so.

36:47.878 --> 36:52.212
Its sorrow is as sweet
to me as a rare wine.

36:56.253 --> 36:58.221
I am yours.

37:02.559 --> 37:03.753
Don't be afraid.

37:04.227 --> 37:07.219
- Who says I'm afraid?
- You do!

37:07.664 --> 37:09.757
You stink of fear!

37:13.236 --> 37:14.726
Quite the parlor trick.

37:16.273 --> 37:19.242
You wait till you see my next one.

38:09.493 --> 38:11.290
Dr. Jekyll...

38:11.461 --> 38:13.361
...at your service.

38:18.468 --> 38:20.265
So...

38:21.271 --> 38:22.636
...the League is set.

38:29.312 --> 38:30.973
So is the date for the conference.

38:31.314 --> 38:34.215
- We have three days.
- Three days?

38:34.851 --> 38:37.217
Can this canoe do that?

38:37.821 --> 38:42.224
You underestimate the Nautilus, sir.

38:42.459 --> 38:45.394
You underestimate her greatly.

39:14.224 --> 39:16.317
She's out of your league.

39:21.565 --> 39:22.827
Mina?

39:25.368 --> 39:28.428
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.

39:31.508 --> 39:33.874
Fortune rewards the bold.

39:36.212 --> 39:41.240
If you require help during the voyage,
Mrs. Harker, just let me know.

39:41.718 --> 39:45.745
I'm curious how you think
you'll assist me, Agent Sawyer.

39:46.856 --> 39:48.380
Heavy lifting.

39:52.896 --> 39:54.830
Light banter.

39:55.365 --> 39:58.357
- I'm a useful kind of guy.
- You're sweet.

39:59.302 --> 40:00.894
And you're young.

40:01.237 --> 40:04.400
Neither are traits that I hold
in high regard.

40:11.381 --> 40:15.215
The solar panels are fully charged.
We'll be diving in a moment.

40:16.386 --> 40:18.377
Mr. Quatermain.

40:18.555 --> 40:21.217
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Skinner.

40:21.391 --> 40:24.792
- Captain.
- Nemo.

40:54.457 --> 40:58.985
The plans the Fantom stole from
the Bank of England. These are copies.

40:59.329 --> 41:02.423
Da vinci's blueprints of venice.

41:05.602 --> 41:07.695
Its foundations...

41:08.204 --> 41:10.263
...and waterways.

41:12.308 --> 41:14.833
So he'll attack the conference by sea.

41:31.961 --> 41:34.555
Easy, Allan, easy.

41:34.731 --> 41:39.498
Skinner! I want you dressed
at all times!

41:40.804 --> 41:43.739
Or it's my boot up your ass!

41:51.548 --> 41:53.914
Dinner is served, Mr. Quatermain.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.343
I can offer you a jacket,
if you require.

41:56.519 --> 41:58.316
Oh, thank you, no.

41:58.488 --> 42:03.391
But thank you for your
contributions so far.

42:05.895 --> 42:09.729
I may have been overly rude earlier...

42:09.899 --> 42:12.235
...when I called you a pirate.

42:12.235 --> 42:16.831
And I may have been overly charitable
when I said I wasn't.

42:17.006 --> 42:19.372
But I try to live in the now...

42:19.542 --> 42:23.569
...where the ghosts of old wrongs
do not abide. What of you?

42:23.747 --> 42:26.875
I don't believe in ghosts,
although I've seen my share.

42:27.217 --> 42:29.617
Your past haunts you.

42:33.890 --> 42:36.723
vanity, pride...

42:38.261 --> 42:43.233
...mistakes that cost me someone dear.

42:43.233 --> 42:46.896
So now you throw yourself
in harm's way?

42:47.303 --> 42:51.569
Old tigers, sensing the end,
they're at their most fierce.

42:53.309 --> 42:55.243
And they go down fighting.

43:18.268 --> 43:20.634
They're not how I left them, captain.

43:22.305 --> 43:24.273
That's all I'm saying.

43:27.677 --> 43:29.406
Powder?

43:30.647 --> 43:32.774
You think sabotage?

43:33.416 --> 43:35.350
We ain't that far off course.

43:55.438 --> 43:57.340
Did you want something?

43:57.340 --> 44:00.935
No, I was just wondering why
you signed up for all this.

44:03.246 --> 44:05.874
Nemo told me you hate
the British Empire.

44:06.316 --> 44:08.181
They called, and I answered.

44:08.518 --> 44:11.180
Yeah, well that ain't all of it,
though, is it?

44:17.694 --> 44:19.286
Sorry I asked.

44:29.339 --> 44:30.829
A few years ago...

44:31.007 --> 44:35.341
...the British approached me with
a mission for queen and country.

44:35.378 --> 44:38.211
That sounds like the morning ride
to work for you.

44:38.414 --> 44:41.542
I signed on without hesitation.

44:41.718 --> 44:44.209
I even took my son along.

44:45.388 --> 44:49.415
I led and my son followed.

44:50.393 --> 44:53.294
He died in my arms.

44:56.666 --> 45:01.899
After that, I washed my hands
of England and the empire and...

45:02.438 --> 45:08.308
...the legend of
Allan-bloody-Quatermain.

45:17.420 --> 45:18.944
Now...

45:19.389 --> 45:22.187
...would you like to learn how to shoot?

45:23.559 --> 45:27.188
- I can already.
- I saw, it was very American.

45:27.363 --> 45:31.299
Fire enough bullets and hope
to hit the target.

45:31.868 --> 45:36.239
Sawyer, I'm talking about
pipping the ace...

45:36.239 --> 45:38.730
...at 900 yards.

45:41.210 --> 45:42.472
Try.

45:45.381 --> 45:48.544
Easy, easy.

45:56.793 --> 45:58.761
- Aim.
- That's easy.

45:58.928 --> 46:00.896
Allow for wind, target movement.

46:01.230 --> 46:04.563
- Yeah, that's easy too.
- This is the part that's not.

46:04.901 --> 46:07.335
You have to feel the shot.

46:07.737 --> 46:09.967
Take your time with it.

46:10.473 --> 46:12.464
You have all the time you need.

46:13.209 --> 46:16.303
All the time in the world.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.641
Take your...

46:21.751 --> 46:23.582
Too soon.

46:23.753 --> 46:27.985
But that was bloody close.
And at 500 yards too.

46:28.324 --> 46:29.723
Again.

46:38.601 --> 46:41.468
Did you teach your son
to shoot like this?

46:46.542 --> 46:48.305
Quatermain?

47:30.219 --> 47:31.846
That's Kali.

47:32.655 --> 47:34.919
Goddess of death.

47:36.325 --> 47:39.590
Nemo worships death,
can we trust him?

47:41.731 --> 47:44.427
He's not the one I'm worried about.

48:07.190 --> 48:08.714
Mina.

48:10.226 --> 48:13.423
I'm identifying a powder
that Nemo found.

48:15.364 --> 48:17.855
Magnesium phosphorus.

48:18.234 --> 48:21.204
Photographers use it to create a flash.

48:21.204 --> 48:22.569
A camera, perhaps?

48:22.738 --> 48:26.606
It appears that someone wishes
to capture this vessel's secrets.

48:33.583 --> 48:37.576
I was surprised you ultimately
joined the League.

48:39.922 --> 48:44.382
I mean to undo the flaws
in my character.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.892
I want to face my demons.

48:47.263 --> 48:49.458
And what do you know of demons?

48:54.670 --> 48:58.470
Do you recall a space
on the wall of my home?

48:58.941 --> 49:01.307
A picture was missing.

49:02.245 --> 49:05.180
Although the picture is my portrait...

49:06.182 --> 49:09.413
...I doubt you'd recognize
the face upon it.

49:09.819 --> 49:14.347
Every year that passes,
my portrait ages...

49:14.524 --> 49:16.651
...instead of me.

49:18.194 --> 49:20.458
When did you last see it?

49:22.698 --> 49:25.496
I dare not look upon it myself...

49:25.668 --> 49:29.297
...or the magic of the painting
would be undone.

49:39.949 --> 49:40.973
Nightcap?

49:41.551 --> 49:44.281
I'm not much of a drinker.

49:56.299 --> 49:58.790
Just a small one then.

50:06.008 --> 50:07.669
How clumsy of me.

50:07.843 --> 50:10.243
We don't want blood everywhere.

50:11.380 --> 50:13.473
- Do we?
- No.

50:14.250 --> 50:15.478
Not blood.

50:21.824 --> 50:25.726
Yes, Henry. Look, but don't touch.

50:26.729 --> 50:28.856
That's your way.

50:29.999 --> 50:32.368
Just shut up.

50:32.368 --> 50:34.427
- I won't be tricked again.
- Tricked?

50:34.604 --> 50:37.971
You've known what I was about
each time you drank the formula.

50:38.341 --> 50:40.241
Liar! I'm a good man, a good man!

50:40.476 --> 50:43.001
Well, who's lying now?
You want it!

50:43.379 --> 50:47.008
Even more than you want her.
You can't shut me out forever!

50:47.350 --> 50:48.681
- Drink the elixir!
- No!

50:48.851 --> 50:51.285
- She barely even looks at you!
- Be quiet!

50:52.722 --> 50:54.690
She looked at me!

50:57.360 --> 50:59.851
Contain your evil, doctor!

51:01.364 --> 51:04.561
I'll not have the brute free
upon my ship.

51:04.767 --> 51:06.394
Must I take drastic steps?

51:06.602 --> 51:09.935
- I am in control.
- I very much doubt it.

51:10.273 --> 51:15.210
Your talk is all well and good, sir,
but your own past is far from laudable.

51:33.929 --> 51:35.328
Let me out.

51:38.801 --> 51:43.295
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I already had.

51:44.774 --> 51:47.299
One of the vials is missing.

51:48.544 --> 51:50.307
Oh, God.

51:50.346 --> 51:56.649
So it's clear. With da vinci's blueprints
and enough explosives...

51:56.819 --> 52:00.846
...he could set a bomb that would
blow venice's foundations to rubble.

52:01.257 --> 52:05.990
- He's gonna sink the whole city.
- Yes, and spark off his world war.

52:06.996 --> 52:09.863
I'm afraid that's not the sum
of our problems.

52:12.568 --> 52:16.766
Skinner, he's taken a vial
of my formula.

52:17.440 --> 52:20.309
- Are you sure?
- Who else?

52:20.309 --> 52:23.574
You've seen the way
the sneaky blackguard operates.

53:10.826 --> 53:13.262
It's the carnival.

53:13.262 --> 53:15.822
My God, we must locate that bomb.

54:17.493 --> 54:19.586
We can go no further, captain.

54:19.762 --> 54:21.229
All ahead, stop.

54:47.022 --> 54:48.956
Deploy the divers beneath the city.

54:49.258 --> 54:52.318
- The explosives must be found.
- Aye, aye, sir.

54:52.495 --> 54:55.487
The city is vast. It could be anywhere.

54:55.998 --> 54:59.331
- What about Skinner?
- I'd be alert for his treachery.

55:11.514 --> 55:13.345
Bloody carnival.

55:13.549 --> 55:16.285
God, I feared the worst.

55:16.285 --> 55:18.185
It's all right. We still have...

55:29.265 --> 55:33.258
- The buildings are falling like dominoes!
- We're too late!

55:35.337 --> 55:37.237
There must be more than one bomb.

55:37.873 --> 55:39.397
Nemo!

55:39.875 --> 55:43.709
The bombs are at the city's center.
We must take out one key building.

55:43.879 --> 55:47.315
- Get ahead and destroy the next building!
- Interrupt the chain!

55:47.483 --> 55:51.977
With a beacon at the coordinates, I could
launch a rocket and take out the domino.

55:52.321 --> 55:55.313
That's ridiculous!
We'd never get there in time.

55:55.357 --> 55:59.225
- No room for error, but it could work.
- What are you talking about?

55:59.295 --> 56:03.664
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle.
How can we outrun this?

56:10.873 --> 56:12.738
Care for a spin?

56:16.445 --> 56:17.776
Come on, Jekyll, get in!

56:17.947 --> 56:20.279
- I'll need coordinates.
- Can you track this?

56:20.449 --> 56:22.440
- Of course.
- Then this is the target.

56:22.618 --> 56:24.677
- Launch when you see the flare.
- Right.

56:24.853 --> 56:28.380
- Jekyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.
- No!

56:28.757 --> 56:31.226
Hyde will never use me again.

56:31.226 --> 56:33.524
Then what good are you?

56:46.609 --> 56:48.634
Straight ahead, then turn left.

56:48.844 --> 56:51.244
No, no, take a right
after the canal ports.

56:51.413 --> 56:54.211
We must turn left to get ahead of the...

56:56.385 --> 56:57.750
Snipers!

56:59.254 --> 57:02.246
Damn Skinner, he must have
told them we were coming.

57:18.407 --> 57:20.238
Dorian!

57:24.613 --> 57:27.275
- Can't get a clear shot!
- Then take the wheel!

57:28.584 --> 57:30.245
Sawyer!

57:34.657 --> 57:38.616
Sit down, you buffoon. I don't know
how to drive this bloody thing!

57:39.662 --> 57:41.391
Get down!

57:42.498 --> 57:43.795
Got it!

57:43.999 --> 57:47.491
Save your bullets. These men are mine!

57:50.005 --> 57:51.666
Did you see that?

57:53.976 --> 57:57.468
- Did you see what she just did?
- Keep your eyes on the road!

58:06.188 --> 58:08.179
It's a gauntlet!

58:08.957 --> 58:11.949
The vampire lady has us covered!

58:43.525 --> 58:47.262
The collapse has reached the carnival.
Time's running out.

58:47.262 --> 58:49.423
Tune the tracer to the car's frequency.

58:49.598 --> 58:52.590
- The rocket must be ready to launch.
- Aye, aye, captain.

59:11.253 --> 59:13.448
Come on, Sawyer, come on!

59:13.622 --> 59:16.682
- Captain, we must pull out!
- No, we stay and do our job!

59:24.199 --> 59:26.599
Remember the flare. I'm off!

59:27.736 --> 59:30.728
- What?
- Don't forget, you're the target.

59:54.329 --> 59:57.423
- We'll be smashed apart!
- Nemo says we stay, we stay.

01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:08.299
He's overtaken the collapse!
Be ready to launch!

01:00:23.325 --> 01:00:24.417
Launch!

01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:38.363
Bravo, boy.

01:01:02.865 --> 01:01:04.890
He's done it.

01:01:28.357 --> 01:01:31.019
venice still stands.

01:01:37.366 --> 01:01:39.231
You've failed.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.867
You see yourself as the brave
John Bull.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.680
But you're weak.

01:01:55.284 --> 01:01:58.947
You run from the memory
of your son's death.

01:01:59.354 --> 01:02:02.790
You should have trained him
a little better.

01:02:06.361 --> 01:02:10.730
You may as well have put the gun to
his head and pulled the trigger yourself.

01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:17.238
Oh, yes, I know all about you.

01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:22.574
I know all about your spy.

01:02:22.911 --> 01:02:24.708
Do you?

01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:31.617
Mr. Gray? What happened?

01:02:31.787 --> 01:02:34.415
Misadventure. Have the others returned?

01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:37.922
You're the first, hopefully not the last.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.821
That bastard, Skinner.
A lot to answer for.

01:02:41.997 --> 01:02:44.795
Skinner? No.

01:02:45.334 --> 01:02:46.892
Me.

01:03:06.855 --> 01:03:08.186
You?

01:03:09.658 --> 01:03:11.751
You don't know the half of it.

01:03:26.274 --> 01:03:28.799
The Fantom is M.

01:03:30.245 --> 01:03:32.270
And the hunt is still on.

01:03:32.447 --> 01:03:35.211
- What are you talking about?
- The Fantom is M...

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:37.718
...the man who recruited us.
- Let me see that.

01:03:37.886 --> 01:03:40.821
- But how?
- We'll get our answers.

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:44.288
- Where are the others?
- Dorian's missing in action.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.854
And Mr. Skinner must have fled
when he realized we knew.

01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:53.328
And Sawyer?

01:03:53.502 --> 01:03:56.403
He'll live to fight another day.

01:04:02.344 --> 01:04:06.576
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats
for this evening.

01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:11.542
Captain!

01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:22.325
It was Gray...

01:04:22.364 --> 01:04:24.264
...not Skinner.

01:04:26.501 --> 01:04:29.299
Gray has tricked us all.

01:04:41.516 --> 01:04:43.251
What is it?

01:04:43.251 --> 01:04:45.719
The sound of treachery!

01:05:00.718 --> 01:05:02.481
What is that thing?

01:05:02.687 --> 01:05:05.383
My exploration pod.

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:27.439
- We could track it.
- I intend to catch it!

01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:08.849
That is us.

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.011
That is the Nautiloid.

01:06:11.389 --> 01:06:13.550
We will be upon them soon.

01:06:14.259 --> 01:06:16.591
You okay?

01:06:16.761 --> 01:06:19.696
Just a little shaken.

01:06:30.408 --> 01:06:31.898
Nemo?

01:06:32.076 --> 01:06:34.442
It's nothing of mine.

01:06:37.282 --> 01:06:40.877
Captain, the noise came from this.

01:06:41.052 --> 01:06:43.043
A recording disk?

01:06:51.663 --> 01:06:53.824
Ready, professor?

01:06:55.466 --> 01:06:57.024
Recording.

01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:02.097
Gentlemen, if you're hearing this...

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.273
...then every step leading up to it
has gone as planned.

01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:07.911
And I have been true
to the goals set to me.

01:07:08.246 --> 01:07:09.645
Yes, it's me, Dorian.

01:07:09.847 --> 01:07:12.975
As you know by now,
I'm no Ioyal son of the Empire.

01:07:13.318 --> 01:07:16.685
My Ioyalty to Mr. M comes
in no small part from his possession...

01:07:16.854 --> 01:07:19.948
...of something I hold very dear
to my heart...

01:07:20.325 --> 01:07:22.589
...something I would do anything
to regain.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.320
- Are you all right?
- My ears hurt. It's nothing.

01:07:25.496 --> 01:07:28.299
Everything so far
has been misdirection.

01:07:28.299 --> 01:07:31.302
Sanderson Reed,
the assassins in Kenya...

01:07:31.302 --> 01:07:35.295
...your recruitment and mission,
the secret conference, a myth.

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:39.276
Even the League itself. There is
no League. There never was.

01:07:39.444 --> 01:07:42.072
It was a ruse to get me closer
to my goals.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.271
He likes the sound of his own voice.

01:07:44.449 --> 01:07:47.941
You see, I want you, each of you,
even tired old Ouatermain.

01:07:48.286 --> 01:07:50.686
He'll capture Hyde
where all others have failed.

01:07:50.855 --> 01:07:53.790
The question is why.
Why all this mask and mystery?

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:58.553
Because in the war to come, I intend
to wield the greatest weapon of all:

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:00.960
The power of the League itself.

01:08:01.299 --> 01:08:04.791
Turn it off, Henry.
Please, turn it off.

01:08:05.002 --> 01:08:09.240
To that end, I set my wolf
among you sheep...

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.502
Growl.

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:13.506
...who'll gain your trust,
quietly lead you astray.

01:08:13.711 --> 01:08:17.408
And all the while, I'll collect you,
the parts of you I need.

01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:19.479
Nemo's science.

01:08:19.684 --> 01:08:20.981
Magnesium phosphorus.

01:08:21.352 --> 01:08:23.252
Skinner's skin sample.

01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:25.889
You scratched me.

01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:28.349
Jekyll's potion.

01:08:30.027 --> 01:08:32.689
And Mina's blood.

01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:38.294
He's stolen us, and we let him.

01:08:38.336 --> 01:08:41.600
If you fail to save venice,
then I get my war.

01:08:41.773 --> 01:08:43.502
And if you succeed...

01:08:43.674 --> 01:08:47.371
...well, it's a small price to pay
for Gray to go about his task.

01:08:47.545 --> 01:08:50.377
War will come, sooner or later...

01:08:50.548 --> 01:08:52.880
...as inevitable as summer into autumn.

01:08:53.084 --> 01:08:56.611
Now, some of you, perhaps Ouatermain
if he isn't dead...

01:08:56.787 --> 01:08:59.779
...will pause to ask why I'm letting
you know all this.

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:02.948
What fool reveals his stratagem
before the game is over?

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:07.464
It is over, for you...

01:09:07.665 --> 01:09:10.566
...because my voice isn't
the only sound being made.

01:09:10.768 --> 01:09:15.796
While I've rambled on, a secondary layer
of inaudible sound...

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.278
...higher than humans can hear,
audible to dogs and lower animals...

01:09:20.278 --> 01:09:25.738
...has been heard by crystal sensors
dotted about your vessel.

01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:29.283
Sensors attached to bombs.

01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:32.685
"Bomb " voyage.

01:10:19.403 --> 01:10:20.927
Out of the way!

01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:23.500
We have to surface!

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:26.608
We're taking in water!
Controls are not responding!

01:10:26.811 --> 01:10:30.770
Primary engine room almost full!
Aft bulkhead open. Pump valves jammed!

01:10:30.982 --> 01:10:32.973
- Seal it off!
- There are men in there!

01:10:33.351 --> 01:10:36.809
For the greater good, we must seal it!

01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:49.432
We can do it, Henry.

01:10:49.467 --> 01:10:51.025
What are you talking about?

01:10:51.435 --> 01:10:54.802
You know we can do it, together!

01:11:05.049 --> 01:11:07.351
Seal it! Seal it up!

01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:09.581
Wait!

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:12.347
Don't close it!

01:11:12.857 --> 01:11:15.359
- What are you doing?
- It's our last chance.

01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:17.384
But I'm ordered to close it!

01:11:17.595 --> 01:11:19.324
Then close it.

01:11:21.098 --> 01:11:22.531
Seal it up.

01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:40.575
Bravo, Edward. Bravo!

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:16.676
Let's not make a saint out of a sinner.
Next time, he may not be so helpful.

01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:19.907
Can we still follow Gray?

01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:25.322
Well, we were the faster,
but now we're the tortoise to his hare.

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:28.780
- So we're done?
- No, we're alive.

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:32.827
If M has any ideas to the contrary,
that gives us an edge.

01:13:33.864 --> 01:13:35.855
We're getting a signal.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:39.829
Morse code.

01:13:40.004 --> 01:13:42.495
- What's it say?
- "Hello, my freaky darlings."

01:13:42.707 --> 01:13:43.935
Skinner?

01:13:44.308 --> 01:13:48.506
"Hiding onboard little fish
with Gray and M.

01:13:48.679 --> 01:13:54.584
On way to base, east by northeast.
Follow my lead."

01:14:48.939 --> 01:14:51.032
Good work...

01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:52.932
...all of you.

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:55.442
Captain?

01:14:55.946 --> 01:14:57.811
All ahead, full!

01:15:13.397 --> 01:15:15.558
If Skinner's headings are correct...

01:15:15.733 --> 01:15:19.294
...we will pass through
the treacherous Straits of Tartary...

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:22.406
...and enter the Amur River,
which empties out...

01:15:22.406 --> 01:15:28.970
...into the frozen lakes of Mongolia,
virtually inaccessible to outsiders.

01:15:58.475 --> 01:16:00.807
Peasant settlements.

01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:02.673
They're all deserted.

01:16:02.847 --> 01:16:05.281
Why deserted?

01:16:08.319 --> 01:16:10.480
Fear, no doubt.

01:16:40.351 --> 01:16:42.649
M's summer retreat.

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.550
This is where Skinner signaled
he'd meet us.

01:16:45.756 --> 01:16:47.519
So we wait.

01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:14.911
Skinner?

01:17:54.959 --> 01:17:58.417
- We heard a noise.
- It was nothing.

01:18:06.437 --> 01:18:09.497
Just an old tiger sensing his end.

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:14.006
Perhaps this was not his time
to die after all.

01:18:18.816 --> 01:18:22.411
- I've been waiting all week to do that.
- Get a grip, man.

01:18:22.586 --> 01:18:24.986
Well, I thought I just did.

01:18:26.323 --> 01:18:27.950
Mina.

01:18:28.292 --> 01:18:31.328
- Report!
- Well, hello to you too.

01:18:31.328 --> 01:18:34.695
And need I remind you,
I am naked in the snow.

01:18:34.865 --> 01:18:40.394
I can't feel any of my extremities,
and I mean any of them.

01:18:45.275 --> 01:18:47.311
With all the suspicion on the ship...

01:18:47.311 --> 01:18:50.041
...I knew you wouldn't believe
I wasn't the spy.

01:18:50.414 --> 01:18:53.042
I thought it was best to disappear.

01:18:53.283 --> 01:18:55.319
So, what are we dealing with?

01:18:55.319 --> 01:18:57.378
The fortress is vast.

01:18:57.554 --> 01:19:02.389
Furnaces produce iron for making
M's weapons of destruction.

01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:16.405
They're pieced together on the factory
floor by a private army of ruthless men...

01:19:16.573 --> 01:19:18.803
...who share his vision.

01:19:21.245 --> 01:19:24.237
But the worst was to come.

01:19:24.515 --> 01:19:30.977
In the dry dock, M's best minds
pervert Nemo's dream.

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:36.360
- The Nautilus?
- Nautili. There's eight, for now.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.364
- What about the kidnapped scientists?
- M holds their families hostage.

01:19:40.364 --> 01:19:44.323
The men work,
or the women and children die.

01:19:45.369 --> 01:19:47.803
- Monstrous!
- That isn't the half of it.

01:19:48.072 --> 01:19:52.338
The scientists are forced to work night
and day to make new versions of us.

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:57.003
Invisible spies, an army of Hydes,
vampiric assassins.

01:19:57.381 --> 01:20:00.509
M leaves for Europe today
with a sample of the chemicals...

01:20:00.684 --> 01:20:03.312
...to sell to the most eager nation.

01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:08.358
- I'll not let my evil infect the world.
- Do you think any of us feel differently?

01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:10.425
Chimney pipes laced to buildings...

01:20:10.594 --> 01:20:13.757
...and bombs in the furnaces
would make quite a bang.

01:20:13.931 --> 01:20:18.891
But someone needs to blow that place
to hell, and I am least likely to be seen.

01:20:19.069 --> 01:20:23.699
Skinner, I didn't know that you were
such a bare-faced liar.

01:20:23.874 --> 01:20:27.310
All that time pretending
that you weren't a hero?

01:20:27.478 --> 01:20:29.946
Shut up, or I'll come to my senses.

01:20:30.114 --> 01:20:35.484
And besides, any more like me,
and I'll lose the franchise.

01:20:37.488 --> 01:20:42.050
No, this cannot be a hunt
to the death, more's the pity.

01:20:42.426 --> 01:20:46.385
We must take M alive
if his secrets are to be uncovered.

01:20:46.597 --> 01:20:48.497
Not Gray.

01:20:48.665 --> 01:20:50.462
He's lived long enough.

01:20:50.634 --> 01:20:53.899
- Oh, I'll handle him.
- No.

01:20:55.472 --> 01:20:58.339
Nemo, you and Hyde
will free the prisoners.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:01.469
Sawyer and I will deal with M.

01:21:02.412 --> 01:21:03.970
Then the game is on.

01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:08.683
Do you mind?

01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:12.880
Night-night.

01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:23.630
Your painting's in your room.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:29.295
In return for the League, that was our
deal, and I'm glad to see you honor it.

01:21:29.339 --> 01:21:30.601
So, what now?

01:21:31.308 --> 01:21:35.938
London. I've had my fill of violence.
Now I'm in the mood for vice.

01:21:36.113 --> 01:21:39.708
You could stay, share my dream.

01:21:42.352 --> 01:21:46.550
I've lived long enough to see the future
become history, professor.

01:21:46.723 --> 01:21:51.422
Empires crumble.
There are no exceptions.

01:21:51.628 --> 01:21:54.062
You think you're better than me.

01:21:54.398 --> 01:21:59.927
You forget, I've seen your painting.

01:22:57.861 --> 01:23:00.386
Skinner said turn right at the column.

01:23:00.564 --> 01:23:02.498
Oh, great. Which one?

01:23:04.101 --> 01:23:06.365
This way.

01:23:09.306 --> 01:23:11.797
You lead, and I'll follow.

01:23:14.645 --> 01:23:16.374
The scientists.

01:23:16.546 --> 01:23:18.946
They're for Nemo.

01:23:33.297 --> 01:23:37.427
Prepare the armaments for shipment.
Prepare the armaments for shipment.

01:23:37.601 --> 01:23:39.398
They're moving out.

01:23:39.569 --> 01:23:41.799
Let's hope Skinner's up to the task.

01:23:41.972 --> 01:23:43.530
You, help him out!

01:24:11.335 --> 01:24:13.701
Release them!

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:15.337
Quietly!

01:24:16.273 --> 01:24:18.639
Get them back to the ship.

01:24:58.315 --> 01:25:00.806
Intruders! Intruders!

01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:03.046
Intruders!

01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:25.901
James, here's your box of tricks!

01:25:28.345 --> 01:25:31.348
The brute's potion,
the vampire's blood...

01:25:31.348 --> 01:25:36.353
...the Indian's science
and mounted samples of invisible skin.

01:25:36.353 --> 01:25:38.378
They'll be all the rage in Europe.

01:25:38.555 --> 01:25:40.785
The Nautiloid is fueled and ready.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.854
- We have trouble.
- Trouble? I call it sport.

01:25:48.064 --> 01:25:52.797
Intruders! Indians! I think it's
Captain Nemo and his men!

01:25:53.036 --> 01:25:54.731
The prisoners are escaping!

01:25:54.905 --> 01:25:57.874
How many times do I have
to kill these cretins?

01:25:58.041 --> 01:26:00.407
- Make this the last.
- Damn them.

01:26:24.334 --> 01:26:27.269
Nemo, get the scientists!

01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:30.605
Is that all you've got?

01:26:57.334 --> 01:27:00.098
Do not move, M.

01:27:01.304 --> 01:27:07.334
Or would you prefer
Professor James Moriarty?

01:27:08.278 --> 01:27:11.805
James Moriarty,
the so-called Napoleon of crime?

01:27:12.382 --> 01:27:17.684
That man died at Reichenbach Falls.
He died, and I was reborn.

01:27:21.258 --> 01:27:23.249
Watch out!

01:27:23.793 --> 01:27:26.694
Eyes open, boy.
Can't protect you all of the time.

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.574
Hello, lover.

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:55.414
Mina.

01:27:58.695 --> 01:27:59.992
You're alive.

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:03.322
It's possible I can't die.

01:28:05.735 --> 01:28:08.704
The same could be said of you.

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.309
Let's put it to the test.

01:28:18.715 --> 01:28:21.741
- Minx.
- Do you realize what you've done?

01:28:22.285 --> 01:28:23.752
What you've let out of me?

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.411
A woman's wrath. Oh, I'm petrified!

01:28:35.365 --> 01:28:37.299
We'll be at this all day.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:55.418
The bedroom, Mina, does it give
you memories or ideas?

01:28:55.418 --> 01:28:56.646
Ideas.

01:28:59.055 --> 01:29:03.355
If that had been permanent,
I'd have been very upset.

01:29:04.294 --> 01:29:06.387
Your painting.

01:29:12.736 --> 01:29:16.272
I hoped I'd get to nail you
one more time.

01:29:16.272 --> 01:29:19.241
I didn't think it'd be literally.

01:29:34.424 --> 01:29:36.585
Skinner?

01:29:38.395 --> 01:29:41.796
It's okay. It's Skinner.
What the hell are you doing here?

01:29:41.998 --> 01:29:44.262
What makes you think I'm Skinner?

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.402
Sawyer!

01:30:52.402 --> 01:30:54.393
Run for it!

01:31:03.113 --> 01:31:04.478
Keep moving!

01:31:04.681 --> 01:31:07.377
Go over! Go, quickly!

01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:23.531
Come on! You want more?

01:31:25.802 --> 01:31:27.861
No!

01:31:30.373 --> 01:31:33.308
Not the whole thing.

01:31:52.962 --> 01:31:55.658
You are so lovely.

01:32:07.777 --> 01:32:09.836
Thank you.

01:32:12.282 --> 01:32:15.012
You broke my heart once.

01:32:15.351 --> 01:32:17.911
This time you missed.

01:32:18.087 --> 01:32:21.955
You spoke once of wanting
to meet your demon.

01:32:30.366 --> 01:32:33.767
Here he is.

01:32:56.993 --> 01:32:59.359
Skinner?

01:33:02.332 --> 01:33:05.460
That's the last time I play
with matches.

01:33:29.993 --> 01:33:31.483
End of the line, Moriarty.

01:33:41.004 --> 01:33:43.996
To the death, but you'll need Hyde
to make it mine.

01:33:44.374 --> 01:33:46.342
He'll be making his own fun.

01:33:51.347 --> 01:33:53.338
Nemo!

01:33:57.353 --> 01:33:59.412
Here!

01:34:00.089 --> 01:34:02.387
Nemo!

01:34:10.533 --> 01:34:12.899
Nemo, run!

01:34:32.388 --> 01:34:33.912
What is that thing?

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:36.991
It's me on a bad day.

01:35:27.844 --> 01:35:30.540
He's too strong. We're trapped.

01:35:30.747 --> 01:35:34.342
No, he's burning through the formula
at an accelerated rate.

01:35:38.321 --> 01:35:40.846
He'll soon change back.

01:35:41.891 --> 01:35:43.791
Nemo!

01:36:00.009 --> 01:36:02.807
I hope I've got your fire
when I'm your age.

01:36:03.413 --> 01:36:06.780
You will not live beyond today.
That I promise you.

01:36:22.865 --> 01:36:26.402
Hyde. Come on.

01:36:26.402 --> 01:36:28.666
My formula's done.

01:36:48.925 --> 01:36:50.620
Watch out!

01:36:56.065 --> 01:36:59.432
Think you'll come in here
and wreck this? I'll rebuild it.

01:37:09.245 --> 01:37:11.770
There'll be others like me,
Quatermain.

01:37:11.981 --> 01:37:14.745
You can't kill the future.

01:38:11.307 --> 01:38:13.605
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?

01:38:13.943 --> 01:38:17.811
The League, me, Skinner.

01:38:18.514 --> 01:38:19.776
Wrong.

01:38:19.982 --> 01:38:23.008
Wrong about your little
American friend as well.

01:38:23.352 --> 01:38:25.445
Do you really think
he's ready for action?

01:38:25.922 --> 01:38:29.551
I think you've trained him about as well
as you trained your son.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.323
Get him.

01:39:12.034 --> 01:39:14.332
- It's too far.
- Take your time.

01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:16.563
You're ready.

01:39:22.545 --> 01:39:25.571
Take your time.

01:39:58.581 --> 01:40:00.378
I got him.

01:40:03.419 --> 01:40:08.083
May this new century be yours, son...

01:40:09.592 --> 01:40:12.459
...as the old one was mine.

01:41:01.644 --> 01:41:05.580
You remember he swore Africa
wouldn't let him die?

01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:08.381
I wish the old boy had been right.

01:41:12.688 --> 01:41:14.781
What's next?

01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:17.049
I have long hidden away
from the world.

01:41:17.393 --> 01:41:22.592
Now I wish to see it anew
as the century turns.

01:41:22.798 --> 01:41:24.993
You're all welcome to join me.

01:41:25.701 --> 01:41:28.829
We've all been hiding
in one form or another.

01:41:31.107 --> 01:41:33.405
The Nautilus awaits.

01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:35.973
So who's coming?

01:41:39.348 --> 01:41:41.873
So long, old chap.

01:41:42.051 --> 01:41:44.349
Goodbye, Allan.

01:41:50.993 --> 01:41:52.052
Goodbye.

01:41:55.998 --> 01:41:57.829
Thanks.
