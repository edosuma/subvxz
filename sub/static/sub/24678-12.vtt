Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:08.074 --> 00:11.682
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.712 --> 00:13.385
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.413 --> 00:15.324
These are their stories.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.396
For years, he went to the gym
every evening at 7:00.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.660
Two weeks ago, he started
going in the morning.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.429
- It's no problem.
- Hello, Jack.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.960
- Hey, how are you?
- Do you have to do that?

00:25.993 --> 00:28.667
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Relax. That's me.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.231
I'll be right back.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.171
Yes?

00:34.201 --> 00:36.681
I was just thinking about you.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.512
You're welcome.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.519
I remembered you liked tulips,

00:40.541 --> 00:42.350
so I thought--

00:42.376 --> 00:45.186
yes, yes, that'll be fine.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.692
It's Part 42, Judge Ross.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.387
I'll see you there.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.369
Man #1 on tape: Do you have to do that?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.234
Man #2 on tape: Relax.

01:01.028 --> 01:04.474
Mr. Keefer waited till his victim
reached a deserted part of 2nd Avenue

01:04.498 --> 01:05.977
before striking her.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.639
He then ran into the subway,
and got rid of his coat and hat.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.478
When he was stopped by the police,

01:10.504 --> 01:12.313
he gave a false name and address.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.979
What, if anything, did you
conclude from this behavior?

01:15.008 --> 01:17.488
He attacked his victim not
because of some delusion,

01:17.511 --> 01:20.651
but because she rejected
his advances at work.

01:20.681 --> 01:24.652
In those respects, he does not
meet the criteria for a plea

01:24.685 --> 01:28.428
of not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.332
Thank you, Doctor.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.166
Judge: Thank you, Mr. Carver.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.332
Before cross-examination
of the expert witness,

01:35.362 --> 01:37.672
the Court calls a 15 minute recess.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.338
It meant a lot to me
you were there this afternoon.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.506
I know you had to rush, and don't worry,

01:42.536 --> 01:44.516
I'll take care of that traffic ticket.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.178
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.517
About Saturday, if you can't--

01:49.543 --> 01:52.183
No, no, no. I cleared my schedule.

01:52.212 --> 01:54.192
Thank you.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.717
She really needs to talk to someone.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.031
Here. No, thanks.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.794
Hmm? Thank you.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.802
I have to drive home.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.134
Sara, listen, as part of my per diem,

02:06.159 --> 02:08.469
the DA got me a suite here tonight.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.668
We could finish this bottle up there.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.976
That's a very tempting offer.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.845
Please say yes.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.979
It's too soon, Charles.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.319
I hope you understand.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.324
Sure. Sure.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.485
Everything in good time.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.256
( applauding )

02:30.283 --> 02:34.561
Thank you so much for coming
on this very special day for Ricky.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.069
So much has happened these last few months,

02:38.091 --> 02:41.004
but Richard has acted like
a man and I am very,

02:41.028 --> 02:42.837
very proud of him.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.843
Seeing him grow up like this,

02:44.865 --> 02:48.210
I just wish his sister Sophie would stay a
little girl forever.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.010
( crowd "awws")

02:50.037 --> 02:52.347
Everybody, this is-- this is Lauren.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.283
Hi, honey!

02:54.307 --> 02:56.878
Well, thank you, and enjoy yourselves.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.446
( applauding )

03:03.583 --> 03:05.119
Hi.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.496
How he dares invite that bimbo...

03:09.156 --> 03:12.365
I'm sorry, Julie, he just makes me so mad.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.338
- Sara.
- Charles.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.636
This is my sister Julie.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.976
And this is Sophie. This is Dr. Webb.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.642
Charlie'll do. And how are you, Sophie?

03:24.671 --> 03:26.981
- Good.
- Why don't we all sit over there?

03:27.007 --> 03:29.487
- You know, I don't know.
- It can only help.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.318
Sara, you can't force these things.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.915
- Whenever you're ready.
- She's ready now.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.526 --> 03:48.699
- Have you seen Sophie?
- She's fine.

03:51.198 --> 03:54.111
- Who's that with her?
- A friend of mine.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.573
Excuse me. Sophie, could you
come with Daddy, please?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.109
Dr. Larry Feldman.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.950
Dr. Charles Webb.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.580
Oh? What specialty?

04:04.611 --> 04:06.613
Psychiatry.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.817
I warned you.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.654
I'm so sorry.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.469
- Leeza Goldman is hot.
- I don't know.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.130
When you slow dance with her,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.470
she moves up and down
against you. it's weird.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.807
- Dude, you don't like that?
- You guys been waiting long?

04:25.832 --> 04:27.311
Uh-huh.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.813
( knocking )

04:28.835 --> 04:30.815
You okay in there?

04:30.837 --> 04:33.340
- Freddie, you got the key?
- Yeah.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.676
I can hear the faucet running.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.664
- Dad. Dad?
- Jesus. Come on!

04:46.686 --> 04:48.791
- Dad! Dad!
- Come on, come with me.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.064
( theme music playing )

05:39.506 --> 05:41.816
The deceased is a Dr. Larry Feldman.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.651
This was his kid's bar mitzvah.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.816
Nice. Anybody see him go into the can?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.484
No. Nobody heard a shot.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.324
- The rest of the place
was open for business?
- Yeah, for lunch.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.160
- We took down everybody's name
when we got here.
- Good work.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.496
I'm gonna need the credit card
receipts from the restaurant,

05:55.522 --> 05:58.059
plus a list of all the employees. Thanks.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.771
Small caliber weapon,
probably with a silencer,

06:01.795 --> 06:04.605
at a close range, no exit wound.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.941
Slug's still in his noggin.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.346
Looks like he was kneeling over
the toilet when he was shot.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.509
Scuff marks on his knees.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.854
(sniffs)

06:24.150 --> 06:25.788
Gin.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.132
He doesn't have any enemies.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.466
He's a heart surgeon, for God's sake.

06:32.492 --> 06:36.133
- He saved people's lives.
- I'm very sorry.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.802
How long had you been together?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.971
Four months next week.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.947
Dr. Feldman's divorced?

06:42.969 --> 06:45.643
He's separated.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.811
They're still working it out.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.152
- The divorce, I mean.
- How's that been going?

06:51.177 --> 06:54.818
Not good. His ex-wife was here.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.021
I guess she took the kids home.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.630
This is so awful. He was so...

07:02.122 --> 07:04.500
What was Dr. Feldman
drinking at the reception?

07:04.524 --> 07:06.800
Red wine.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.204
He only ever drank red wine.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.742
These people, these animals,

07:15.769 --> 07:18.511
they just left him there for Ricky to see.

07:18.538 --> 07:22.281
Victim's Services has
grief counselors for your kids.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.879
I'll give you the number.

07:23.910 --> 07:27.949
Goren: We need to talk to
you about your divorce.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.455
Sophie, sweetie,

07:32.485 --> 07:34.795
why don't you go and sit with Auntie Sara?

07:34.821 --> 07:37.131
Okay?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.795
Come here, sweetie.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.237
Were there any outstanding
issues between you

07:41.261 --> 07:44.799
and Dr. Feldman-- alimony,
division of property?

07:44.831 --> 07:47.209
- No, that was all settled.
- Custody?

07:48.501 --> 07:50.481
We were working that out.

07:50.503 --> 07:54.747
Larry was very possessive of our children.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.180
It's going to be tough
for them without their father.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.818
It's a horrible thing to do to them.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.295
( sobbing )

08:09.422 --> 08:12.232
I guess the custody issue's
been worked out.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.447
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.973
Especially if it's by the
artist I think it is.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.949
Is this Judas Ullulaq?

08:28.975 --> 08:30.955
Yes, from 1986.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.785
He died a couple of years ago.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.450
His pieces are hard to come by.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.620
We'll take it. How soon can you deliver it?

08:36.649 --> 08:39.458
Really? Thursday next week,
if that's fine with you?

08:39.486 --> 08:41.830
The address is 247 East 54th.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.630
Charles, no. I can't accept this.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.761
It's obvious how much you like it.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.465
It's too generous.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.633
I really can't. All right.

08:49.662 --> 08:53.804
Make the delivery to
741 Park Avenue, apartment SD.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.303
This way you can enjoy it
any time you come over.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.147
What's wrong?

09:00.173 --> 09:04.246
Sara, I am a psychiatrist.
You've been preoccupied all afternoon.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.587
What's the matter?

09:06.613 --> 09:08.752
When I came home last night,

09:08.782 --> 09:11.922
there were 14 calls from you on the machine.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.931
I was just concerned about you.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.263
- I told you I was going out with Julie.
- I forgot.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.429
That's what happens when you're
involved with an older man.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.633
- Are we involved?
- I thought so.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.270
I really do enjoy our time together.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.438
Let's just see where it goes.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.947
"Victim was kneeling
in a humiliation posture when shot."

09:34.974 --> 09:37.784
- What's that about?
- The perp wanted to humiliate him.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.620
"Odor of gin was present.

09:39.646 --> 09:42.957
Possibility perpetrator consumed
gin or martini at restaurant."

09:42.982 --> 09:46.486
- Shaken or stirred?
- We got the waiters working
with the sketch artist.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.625
Restaurant said they served
92 lunches for the bar mitzvah.

09:49.656 --> 09:53.126
Our officers only counted
78 guests when they got there.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.161
14 people skipped.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.971
Eames: 73 names. Great, we're going backwards.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.570
Do you have a master list?

10:05.171 --> 10:06.980
112 people were invited.

10:07.006 --> 10:10.180
- And 103 said they were coming.
- These are the money gifts?

10:11.711 --> 10:15.386
Yes. I didn't know what to do with
it all, so I brought it back here.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.163
Silvia and Adam Bernstein.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.699
Dr. and Mrs. Lawrence Chen.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.839
A grand in C-notes. No card.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.536
Just "Tommy L." on the envelope.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.680
- He's not on the list.
- That's probably Mr. Lucci.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.980
- He was a patient of Dr. Feldman's.
- Goren: When?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.576
Last year. Quadruple bypass.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.680
Oh, right. Tommy "Thumbs" Lucci.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.021
Heart attack from too much cannoli.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.526
The Bonanno's threw him a retirement party.

10:49.549 --> 10:53.190
- He and Dr. Feldman close?
- Mr. Lucci was very thankful.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.960
The operation saved his life.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.366
How'd Lucci show his appreciation?

10:57.390 --> 10:58.892
I'm not quite sure.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.371
I heard Dr. Feldman talking to
him on the phone about his divorce.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.306
I think Mr. Lucci was helping him.

11:10.069 --> 11:13.209
Feldman vs. Feldman,
custody hearing transcript.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.082
Thanks. Help yourself.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.519
Getting anywhere?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.724
Well, alimony orders...

11:23.750 --> 11:26.560
Feldman was pulling down $700,000 a year

11:26.586 --> 11:29.396
and the judge awarded
Mrs. Feldman $1,000 a month.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.629
Out of $5 million in community assets,

11:31.658 --> 11:35.333
Mrs. Feldman gets $300,000.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.568
Who is this judge, the Honorable OJ?

11:37.597 --> 11:39.634
No, Your Honor Edwin Rankin.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.339
Rankin?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.604
I have Lucci's pedigree here.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.317
Lucci's lawyer, Harold Rankin.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.844
You think they're related?

11:50.877 --> 11:53.255
A divorce judge--
the gift that keeps on giving.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.590
I guess that's how Lucci was helping
Feldman with his divorce.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.755
There's one more thing.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.527
Three weeks ago, Judge
Rankin issued a gag order.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.363
Who's the order binding on?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.426
Dr. and Mrs. Feldman, their lawyers,

12:05.458 --> 12:07.631
the immediate families...

12:07.660 --> 12:10.231
And St. Matthew's Hospital.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.042
Woman : I can't talk about it.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.548
The hospital lawyers said I could get sued.

12:17.570 --> 12:22.041
- We understand about lawyers.
- You're a pediatric nurse, isn't that right?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.715
- Yes.
- The gag order's about a child
who was treated here?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.553
- One of the Feldman's kids?
- Please.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.391
We don't want you to say anything
you're not comfortable with.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.556
Who did the lawyers say could sue you?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.430
- Dr. Feldman.
- Don't worry, he's dead.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.262
Which of the kids was it, the little girl?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.240
Her mother brought her in.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.407
She was listless and she said
she had pain in her groin.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.576
She had just come back
from visiting her father.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.780
Mrs. Feldman accused
her husband of abusing her.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.924
Were you there when they examined her?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.517
No, just at the beginning.
I was called away.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.519
But from what I saw, her genital
area was red and inflamed.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.395
( cell phone ringing )

13:10.390 --> 13:12.392
Well, I'd kill him.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.233
The District Attorney
had the gag order lifted.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.236
Now we want to hear what happened from you.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.881
Sophie had spent the night at Larry's.

13:34.914 --> 13:39.056
When I went to pick her up, she was groggy.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.328
She could barely walk to the car.

13:43.756 --> 13:47.704
On the way home she said her privates hurt.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.075
I checked.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.078
Something was definitely wrong.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.081
I asked her what happened,
she said it was Daddy.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.379
I went right to the hospital.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.510
Did they say she'd been molested?

14:03.376 --> 14:05.185
They didn't say anything.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.021
A case worker...

14:08.047 --> 14:10.186
From the Children's Protective Services

14:10.216 --> 14:12.856
interviewed me and said he was
going to interview Larry,

14:12.885 --> 14:18.233
but all of a sudden,
Judge Rankin imposed a gag order.

14:18.257 --> 14:21.363
He basically stopped
the investigation in its tracks.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.601
Goren: The custody visits continued.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.734
We couldn't stop it.

14:27.567 --> 14:31.879
I checked Sophie every time
she came back from Larry's.

14:31.904 --> 14:35.852
- It didn't happen again.
- You couldn't be sure it wouldn't.

14:37.243 --> 14:41.191
- No.
- You were terrified and angry you
couldn't protect her.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.660
You thought all kinds of crazy things.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.599
Anyone in your situation would.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.764
If you did something
to protect your little girl...

14:56.429 --> 14:58.739
Anyone could understand that.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.779
Julie, I'm just a divorce attorney.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.509
I don't have a lot of experience
in criminal matters,

15:04.537 --> 15:07.916
but I'm going to advise you not to
answer any more questions right now.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.817
She's free to leave, right?

15:10.209 --> 15:13.520
- If that's what she wants to do.
- Let's go, Julie.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.538
New car? Yes.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.050
5s, 10s, 20s? What is this?

15:40.072 --> 15:42.382
You been saving up from your paper route?

15:42.408 --> 15:44.388
Ben Franklin's on the $100 bill.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.050
I can't stand Franklin.
He had no respect for women.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.719
He used them. Did you know that?

15:49.749 --> 15:53.526
- Right. How much is in here?
- $23,000.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.431
We said $50,000. Where's the rest?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.537
I want you to do something else for me.

16:04.530 --> 16:08.444
- What, are you nuts?
- They're bothering my girlfriend's sister.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.470
These are very bad people.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.176
Yeah, they're bad people.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.014
They're New York City detectives.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.179
Forget it. I'm not doing this.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.854
I knew it. They got to you.
You're working for them now.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.793
You're carrying a listening device.
Is that it on your wrist?

16:27.053 --> 16:29.829
This is a $15 watch.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.860
You'd better have the rest of my
money by the end of the week, Doc,

16:32.892 --> 16:35.429
or I'll give you something
real to worry about.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.184
My interview with the child
confirmed in my own mind

16:47.206 --> 16:49.049
there was abuse.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.386
Dr. Feldman denied it,
and because of the gag order,

16:52.411 --> 16:54.948
I couldn't follow up with other witnesses.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.689
Mrs. Feldman was very angry,
but what could I do?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.027
Did she make any threats against Dr. Feldman?

17:00.052 --> 17:03.829
- No.
- Did any of her family or
friends contact you?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.393
- No.
- Did you talk to the DA's office?

17:06.425 --> 17:08.996
No, it was too early to get them involved.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.009
- What about the Special Victims Unit?
- Not in Manhattan.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.502
But I got a request for a copy of my
file from the Westchester police.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.675
They heard about the abuse and they
wanted to do their own investigation.

17:19.704 --> 17:24.676
- Why the Westchester police?
- Apparently Dr. Feldman had a
country home up there.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.691
Not according to our files, he doesn't.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.123
We never got a report about
a Dr. Feldman, and I never requested one.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.825
Here's the request, Lieutenant.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.697
Yes, that's our stationery.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.862
But the requesting officer,
Detective Petrecca?

17:39.892 --> 17:43.704
- No such person in my unit.
- The report was faxed to this number.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.541
That's not our fax number.
That's the Narcotics Squad, third floor.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.241
And they don't have a
Detective Petrecca either.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.053
I ran comparisons between the
slug we got from Feldman's skull

18:00.079 --> 18:04.152
and every gun recovered by the Westchester
Police in the last three years.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.824
- Your gut did not fail you.
- Actually, it was her idea.

18:07.853 --> 18:11.494
Sorry. I found one weapon
that's a perfect match.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.664
A .32 caliber Rossi 88 with a silencer,

18:14.694 --> 18:17.174
recovered in a drug bust in White Plains.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.107
The weapon was duly checked in

18:19.131 --> 18:21.168
to the Westchester police property room

18:21.200 --> 18:25.376
where it sat for three weeks until
someone noticed that it was missing.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.349
A cop.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.878
Good thing to know our hit man has a day job.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.192
Westchester'll look into the missing gun.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.023
Don't expect them to strain any muscles.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.687
Yes.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.857
You checked under the maiden name, too?

18:40.886 --> 18:43.196
Okay, thanks.

18:43.222 --> 18:48.035
So far I haven't turned up any member of Mrs.
Feldman's family in law enforcement.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.506
Her parents are retired, living in Saratoga.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.531
I got a trace out on his wife's family.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.408
I'm looking at DMV records.

18:54.433 --> 18:57.039
Julie Feldman's sister, Sara Lindstrom,

18:57.069 --> 18:59.777
had a traffic ticket dismissed two weeks ago.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.183
No court appearance, no hearing.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.686
Someone just double-clicked on delete.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.619
I'm not following. You're from
the Major Case Squad

19:10.650 --> 19:13.494
and you're asking me
about a traffic violation?

19:13.519 --> 19:15.499
If you people have run out of things to do,

19:15.521 --> 19:17.330
I've got a couple of unsolved homicides.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.994
We're just curious about what other favors

19:19.025 --> 19:21.164
- you might've done for Ms. Lindstrom.
- Other favors?

19:21.193 --> 19:23.673
Like helping her hire a cop
to kill her brother-in-law--

19:23.696 --> 19:25.539
Larry Feldman, the heart surgeon.

19:25.564 --> 19:29.341
Okay, first of all,
I don't know Sara Lindstrom.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.315
The ticket, that was a favor
to her boyfriend.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.012
- Who is?
- Webb.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.545
- Dr. Charles Webb.
- Webb, the forensic shrink?

19:38.577 --> 19:41.490
Yes. He does a lot of work
for the DA's office.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.929
And the Police Benevolent Association.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.194
Over the last seven years, Webb's conducted

19:51.223 --> 19:54.363
fitness-for-duty evaluations
on five cops up in Westchester,

19:54.393 --> 19:57.533
- two of them in Narcotics.
- I don't see anybody here.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.201
Try this one.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.049
This guy... maybe.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.880
I think he was in the bar.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.716
Do you remember what he was drinking?

20:09.742 --> 20:11.380
Gin and tonic.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.727
Okay, thank you. We'll be in touch.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.698
Officer Michael Stovic,

20:22.722 --> 20:25.100
Westchester PD Narcotics.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.467
11-year veteran, four years Narcotics.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.475
Last year Stovic was suspended

20:31.497 --> 20:34.239
pending an excessive force investigation.

20:34.266 --> 20:37.611
I got news for him. The suspension's
about to get permanent.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.412
Not with this evidence.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.419
Gin or no gin, that ID's iffy.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.752
His connection to Webb doesn't necessarily
mean what you want it to mean.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.122
- It's a coincidence?
- He's a cop, Alex, just like us.

20:48.147 --> 20:52.618
So til I see different...
yeah, it's a coincidence.

20:58.457 --> 21:01.597
( sighs ) I love everything
about this job except that--

21:01.627 --> 21:03.573
buddy-boy system.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.405
What? Did I say something?

21:09.568 --> 21:11.548
Let's go find Officer Stovic.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.881
They're delivering it tomorrow.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.887
I thought this would be a good spot for it.

21:16.909 --> 21:20.049
- Or maybe it's too cluttered.
- No, it'll work here.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.389
You have so many books.

21:22.414 --> 21:25.395
I hardly have any time to read anymore.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.419
I make time for my passions.

21:28.921 --> 21:32.391
Instead of going out,
we could fix something here.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.268
I'm a pretty good cook. Make a fire.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.571
I really would prefer if we just went out.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.043
I just-- I don't feel ready yet.

21:43.269 --> 21:47.081
Listen, we've been seeing each
other now for a couple of months.

21:47.106 --> 21:50.781
Even since my divorce,
I lost hope of meeting someone.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.754
I feel we have a strong connection.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.091
A connection based on respect and trust.

21:58.117 --> 22:04.227
Yes, I think that's true.
I just-- I don't feel ready yet.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.864
I understand. You've had a lot on your mind.

22:08.894 --> 22:11.738
- Yeah.
- Larry's murder, the children.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.671
Thank God Sophie's safe now.

22:19.238 --> 22:22.981
When you found out what
Larry had done to Sophie...

22:24.009 --> 22:27.183
Did you ever think of doing something
about it, if you had the chance?

22:29.748 --> 22:32.558
Yes, I admit, I had that thought.

22:32.585 --> 22:36.192
Well, I did something. I had Larry killed.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.431
- What?
- I paid somebody to kill him.

22:39.458 --> 22:44.066
All the pain he was causing, what he did
to your niece. No one to stop him. But I did.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.406
- You're serious.
- Of course, I'm seri--

22:46.432 --> 22:48.036
Why are you looking at me like that?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.775
I thought you'd be grateful.
You said he should be stopped.

22:50.803 --> 22:56.253
- Grateful? What were you thinking?
- He was a monster, Sara.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.050
Isn't that what you wanted?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.757
I have to go home. I'm sorry.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.522
Sara, you can't go. I did it for you.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.531
- Charles, don't--
- For God's sake.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.032
I saved your niece.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.034
It's all you've ever talked about.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.865
You can't deny me.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.601
Charles, if you don't get out of my way...

23:19.365 --> 23:21.242
Sara, if you do anything foolish,

23:21.267 --> 23:23.247
like tell anybody...

23:26.572 --> 23:28.779
You know what I'm capable of now.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.066
Beer. Whatever you have on tap.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.590
Coming up.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.760
I'm Nina. Are you Mike?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.601
Dr. Webb told you about me, didn't he?

23:51.630 --> 23:54.076
He said I could find you here.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.545
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.445
I'm sorry.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.382
My mistake.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.051
Wait up.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.218
Let's go to my car.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.936
So why would Webb talk to me about you?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.031
Did he talk to you or didn't he?

24:23.062 --> 24:25.702
I haven't heard from the guy
since my suspension.

24:25.731 --> 24:27.870
You a cop? Yeah.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.642
- You got a job problem?
- First, turn on the engine.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.808
I got a problem about being recorded.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.712
( engine starts )

24:36.742 --> 24:38.415
( music plays on radio )

24:40.245 --> 24:43.385
My dirt bag ex-husband's
messing with my little girl.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.122
She's eight.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.063
My ex is a cop and he threatened my lawyer.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.124
And now he won't return my calls.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.896
I tried talking to the brass,

24:51.924 --> 24:53.904
and it's the old buddy-boy system.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.963
Hey, I'm sorry. It's got
nothing to do with me.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.168
Webb told me you were a good guy,

24:58.197 --> 25:00.234
that you'd done this kind of thing before.

25:00.265 --> 25:03.508
- I got money, not a lot--
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

25:03.535 --> 25:05.674
I don't know what Webb told you,

25:05.704 --> 25:08.344
but you can't listen to that guy.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.355
I can't help you. You just
better get out of here now.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.357
Mike, please.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.256
Just look.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.817
- This is my girl, Mandie--
- No! Don't show me that!

25:17.850 --> 25:19.352
Just get out, will you already?!

25:19.385 --> 25:20.887
You guys are all the same.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.263
Big damn heroes.

25:35.734 --> 25:39.341
Doc, you listen to me, and you
listen good, you son of a bitch.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.715
You better keep your mouth shut
about what happened,

25:41.740 --> 25:43.777
or I'll shut it for you.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.720
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.054
I don't need you drumming up business for me!

25:48.080 --> 25:49.753
Understand?!

25:55.921 --> 25:58.401
Stupid mother--

25:58.424 --> 26:01.405
Freeze, Stovic! You're under arrest.

26:06.331 --> 26:09.335
Stovic's voice: Keep your mouth
shut about what happened,

26:09.368 --> 26:10.847
or I'm going to shut it for you.

26:10.869 --> 26:15.011
- Charles: I don't know what
you’re talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.510
I don't need you drumming up
business for me! Understand?!

26:18.544 --> 26:21.525
That stuff about engine noise and radios?

26:21.547 --> 26:23.527
It's not true.

26:23.549 --> 26:27.019
Infer what you want from that
conversation, it doesn't prove a thing.

26:27.052 --> 26:29.032
It's the icing on everything else--

26:29.054 --> 26:32.035
the eyewitness, the missing gun...

26:32.057 --> 26:34.765
Only bright spot I can see, Mike...

26:36.562 --> 26:39.543
Is your motive.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.567
It wasn't about the money...

26:43.068 --> 26:45.878
It was the abuse.

26:45.904 --> 26:48.510
That's why you got a copy of the report--

26:48.540 --> 26:50.577
to make sure it was true.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.084
'Cause you have a history with
that in your own childhood.

27:01.353 --> 27:05.529
It came up on your
fitness-for-duty evaluation.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.340
Webb knew that.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.672
I think your lawyer...

27:12.698 --> 27:16.373
Can make a good argument to the DA

27:16.401 --> 27:19.610
that Webb psychologically manipulated you

27:19.638 --> 27:21.584
into doing this killing.

27:25.043 --> 27:26.784
I really do, Mike.

27:43.061 --> 27:46.474
I want a signed plea agreement
from the DA, then he'll talk.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.410
( man mutters )

27:54.573 --> 27:56.712
First off, he was sane
at the time of the crime.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.484
But file a motion to forcibly medicate
him for the trial,

27:59.511 --> 28:01.491
because his competence is marginal.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.993
Right now he's not presentable to a jury.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.654
- Dr. Charles Webb?
- Yes?

28:05.684 --> 28:07.823
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

28:07.853 --> 28:10.356
For murder. Put your hands behind your back.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.335
People versus Charles Anthony Webb,

28:19.364 --> 28:22.504
murder in the first degree,
conspiracy in the first degree.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.514
- Plea, Mr. Webb?
- Dr. Webb.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.675
Your Honor, pursuant to CPL 250-10,

28:26.705 --> 28:29.584
my client serves a notice
of his intent to plead not guilty

28:29.608 --> 28:33.181
- by reason of mental disease or defect.
- Noted into the record.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.522
Carver: Your Honor; the
People serve cross-notice

28:35.547 --> 28:37.686
and demand the opportunity
to examine the defendant

28:37.716 --> 28:39.525
at such time as Your Honor will provide.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.622
Judge: Parties will be notified.
People on bail?

28:41.653 --> 28:43.223
Carver: People ask for remand.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.963
Lawyer: To a suitable psychiatric
facility, Your Honor.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.699
- We have no objection.
- Judge: Then so ordered.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.468
Next case.

28:52.264 --> 28:55.211
Insanity defense.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.236
He would know.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.318
Man: He asked me to fix
his girlfriend's ticket;

29:09.348 --> 29:12.158
he was ranting she was
being persecuted by the police.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.425
I'd never seen him like this.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.332
He's one of our most
reliable expert witnesses,

29:17.356 --> 29:21.327
and to hear him spouting these paranoid
fantasies was very disturbing.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.863
Judge: Thank you, Mr. Stillman.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.844
I also have affidavits
from Dr. Webb's colleagues

29:27.866 --> 29:31.006
testifying to his erratic
behavior over the last month.

29:31.036 --> 29:34.347
His paranoid rantings,
his delusional statements.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.977
And there’s this--

29:36.008 --> 29:38.682
this is a conversation between
my client and Michael Stovic,

29:38.710 --> 29:41.190
recorded a week before the murder.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.524
Charles' voice: I planned to kill him myself

29:44.549 --> 29:47.530
For years, he went to the gym
every evening at 7:00.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.624
Then two weeks ago,
he started going in the morning.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.363
Stovic's voice: It's no problem.

29:52.391 --> 29:56.032
- Who recorded this?
- My client.

29:56.061 --> 30:00.032
He was worried Mr. Stovic might
try to cheat him out of his money.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.705
By the way, this conversation
took place at Fortelli's.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.407
Judge: Fortelli's down the block?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.473
Wasn't he worried he'd be recognized?

30:06.505 --> 30:08.212
That's the point, Your Honor.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.049
He made no effort to be secretive.

30:10.075 --> 30:13.386
He kept tapes of
incriminating conversations.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.222
It's clear he had no idea
what he was doing was wrong.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.353
He's suffering from
an acute psychotic break

30:18.383 --> 30:20.158
caused by the stress of his work,

30:20.185 --> 30:22.062
the terrible cases he deals with.

30:22.087 --> 30:26.058
Yet during this time, he's testified
as an expert witness at three trials.

30:26.091 --> 30:29.732
This psychosis comes and goes
at the doctor's convenience.

30:29.761 --> 30:32.241
Dr. Webb 's behavior
with regards to this crime

30:32.264 --> 30:34.403
is consistent with a psychiatric defense.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.936
Could somebody please tell him
to stop looking at me?

30:36.968 --> 30:39.175
It's intolerable.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.411
Has this room been swept for bugs?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.442
If I were you Judge, I'd be very careful.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.284
The party can see everything.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.086
I'll keep that in mind, Dr. Webb.

30:48.113 --> 30:52.084
These affidavits and Mr. Cziller's
argument seem credible to me.

30:52.117 --> 30:55.098
I have to be frank--
if Dr. Webb chooses a bench trial,

30:55.120 --> 30:56.929
he's going to get a friendly hearing.

30:56.955 --> 30:59.936
Your Honor, it is hardly
appropriate for you to--

30:59.958 --> 31:03.599
It's appropriate for me to suggest
that you work out a plea agreement.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.972
Consider it fair warning.

31:11.136 --> 31:13.377
He pretended to be crazy to lay the basis

31:13.405 --> 31:16.045
for an insanity defense in case he got caught.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.486
- He's going to get away with it.
- Sympathetic motive.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.719
- Sympathetic defendant.
- Unsympathetic victim.

31:21.747 --> 31:25.593
- Best of all possible worlds.
- How do we trip this guy up?

31:25.617 --> 31:29.394
He's claiming he has delusional
disorder, persecutory type.

31:29.421 --> 31:33.392
From everything I've seen, he's followed
the diagnostic boiler-plate to a tee.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.098
He hit all the right notes.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.573
Except...

31:37.596 --> 31:39.735
He's paranoid about surveillance,

31:39.765 --> 31:42.507
but here he is meeting a cop
in a restaurant-- a public place.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.844
He hit a false note.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.543
It's borderline.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.484
But I'd look for other erratic
behavior that doesn't fit.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.419
Such as?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.354
Suicide talk, spending too much money,

31:53.378 --> 31:55.551
taking on too many projects.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.083
And if there aren't any other false notes?

31:58.116 --> 32:00.687
Don't worry, even Elvis sang out of tune.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.863
I can only imagine what you
think of me right now, Sara.

32:05.891 --> 32:09.168
But you have to believe I had the
best intentions in the world.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.800
The pain your family was going
through was unbearable.

32:11.830 --> 32:16.040
Charles, don't. Whatever
you do, don't lie to me.

32:16.067 --> 32:19.708
You made it very clear to me
that night why you did this.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.378
Your lawyer asked me
to testify on your behalf.

32:22.407 --> 32:26.719
- I agreed.
- I wouldn't expect any less from you.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.555
I'm doing it for Sophie.

32:29.581 --> 32:32.061
Don't you feel anything for me?

32:32.083 --> 32:36.054
I'm a patient man, Sara.
But you already know that.

32:52.437 --> 32:55.077
Clerk: No, he never bought from us before.

32:55.106 --> 32:57.416
I don't even remember ever seeing him in here.

32:57.442 --> 33:00.423
I didn't get the impression
he knew much about Inuit art.

33:00.445 --> 33:03.016
We found an $18,000 charge
on his credit card.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.028
- Is that for one sculpture?
- Yes.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.030
Is that what beginners usually spend?

33:07.052 --> 33:09.362
Well, no, they usually make
more modest acquisitions.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.527
- I think he was trying to
impress his girlfriend.
- Why did you think that?

33:12.557 --> 33:15.037
Well, she liked the piece,
she knew the artist.

33:15.060 --> 33:18.872
- He tried to buy it for her.
- Tried to?

33:18.897 --> 33:21.707
Well, first he wanted me
to deliver it to her address

33:21.733 --> 33:24.873
and she said she couldn't accept.
She was embarrassed.

33:24.903 --> 33:28.715
So he had me deliver it to his place instead.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.880
Did they strike you as a couple?

33:31.910 --> 33:33.719
He seemed pretty eager,

33:33.745 --> 33:35.554
but as far as I could tell...

33:35.580 --> 33:39.118
They could've been on their first date.

33:39.150 --> 33:42.723
The doorman at Webb's building's
only seen Sara Lindstrom there once.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.394
Her doorman says Webb's been
there only a few times--

33:45.423 --> 33:47.232
never overnight.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.739
But he stopped by a lot when she wasn't home.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.399
He sent her flowers every week.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.239
According to his LUDs,
he was calling her 20 times a day.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.712
- Mostly talking to her machine.
- The guy was pressing hard.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.011
It doesn't look like he closed
the deal though.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.108
This guy's never intimate with this woman,

34:01.139 --> 34:03.915
but he hires a hit to save her niece?
That's a hell of a commitment.

34:03.942 --> 34:07.014
Something else not making sense.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.853
Your girlfriend's niece is molested,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.860
as a psychiatrist you'd insist
she get counseling.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.489
I haven't seen any evidence
the girl was in therapy.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.362
Yeah.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.800
Did we get that file
from Children's Services?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.833
This is the transcript

34:26.864 --> 34:29.744
of the case worker's interview with the girl.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.543
Eames--

34:34.072 --> 34:35.710
question:

34:35.739 --> 34:38.380
"Your mommy said your daddy
touched your wee wee,

34:38.409 --> 34:40.047
is she telling the truth?"

34:40.078 --> 34:41.887
Answer, "Yes."

34:41.913 --> 34:44.393
Question-- "When your wee wee was sore,

34:44.416 --> 34:46.554
is that because your Daddy touched it?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.393
Answer, "Yes."

34:51.755 --> 34:53.929
The questions suggest the answer.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.105
The caseworker tainted the interview.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.678
I don't understand. What could
you possibly be looking for?

35:05.704 --> 35:07.684
Eames: It's all in the search warrant.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.778
The cabinets in here are locked.
Would you mind opening them for me?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.345
Please?

35:12.377 --> 35:15.381
Thank you. We appreciate your co-operation.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.235
Hi, Sophie. My name's Bobby.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.035
Hi.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.845
Wow, you're really good
at keeping in the lines.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.221
Hey, what's your favorite color?

35:45.243 --> 35:47.484
- Red.
- Red?

35:47.512 --> 35:49.185
Watch.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.086
(giggles)

35:56.921 --> 35:58.662
Sophie, I'm a policeman.

35:58.690 --> 36:02.001
Is it okay if we talk about your Daddy?

36:02.027 --> 36:04.337
Daddy went away.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.842
I know. You miss him?

36:06.865 --> 36:09.004
Yes.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.775
Sorry.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.679
Do you remember...

36:16.708 --> 36:20.349
That day Mommy took you to the hospital,

36:20.378 --> 36:22.517
after you visited with Daddy?

36:22.547 --> 36:25.118
Yes.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.221
Do you remember what you did with Daddy?

36:29.220 --> 36:31.700
- And what'd you do?
- We went to the zoo.

36:31.723 --> 36:35.193
And I had ice cream. But I got sick.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.206
How did you get sick?

36:37.228 --> 36:39.367
I pooped in my pants.

36:39.397 --> 36:42.105
Daddy said because of the ice cream.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.746
What'd your Daddy do?

36:47.772 --> 36:50.150
He cleaned me down there.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.053
Did he give you any medicine?

36:54.079 --> 36:55.922
Yes.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.290
Did you tell anyone about being sick?

37:00.318 --> 37:02.992
Yes. I told Mommy.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.023
Did you tell anyone else?

37:08.026 --> 37:09.630
Charlie.

37:13.198 --> 37:17.044
- Who's Charlie?
- Auntie Sara's friend.

37:20.805 --> 37:23.684
It's not true. The hospital
didn't imagine what they saw.

37:23.708 --> 37:27.451
What they saw is consistent
to what your niece told me.

37:27.479 --> 37:31.086
She had diarrhea, her father
gave her a pill to stop it.

37:31.116 --> 37:35.030
The pill had a narcotic effect,
that's why she was groggy.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.930
He cleaned her with an astringent.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.799
That's why her skin appeared
to be red and inflamed.

37:39.824 --> 37:41.701
She told the caseworker--

37:41.726 --> 37:44.400
The caseworker didn't ask the right questions.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.207
Your niece wasn't molested.

37:50.568 --> 37:53.549
My sister wouldn't make up
an accusation like that.

37:53.571 --> 37:55.050
My sister wouldn't lie.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.882
She was being clobbered in court,

37:56.908 --> 37:58.649
she was desperate.

37:58.676 --> 38:02.681
What your sister did, it's not our concern.

38:05.016 --> 38:09.487
But your niece also told
Dr. Webb what happened.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.195
He talked to her at the bar mitzvah?

38:13.358 --> 38:15.861
- Yes.
- He knew the truth...

38:17.028 --> 38:19.304
He didn't care.

38:19.330 --> 38:23.278
He wasn't out to save your niece.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.048
He was after something else...

38:31.209 --> 38:32.882
Wasn't he?

38:33.878 --> 38:36.688
Ms. Lindstrom, we don't blame you
for protecting him.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.126
Now, you need to tell us what you know.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.195
Lawyer: I'm glad you finally
came to your senses.

38:49.227 --> 38:52.208
Carver: We never took leave
of them, unlike Dr. Webb.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.039
I've prepared a proposal.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.602
Commitment at Morgan Psychiatric in Carmel

38:56.634 --> 38:58.204
for no less than six months.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.273
Followed by quarterly evaluations

39:00.305 --> 39:03.946
until it's determined
he's no longer a threat to society.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.080
Carver: We're not too far apart.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.147
We propose a plea to murder two,

39:08.179 --> 39:11.786
incarceration at Sing Sing
Prison for no less than 25 years,

39:11.816 --> 39:15.320
and regular evaluations
by the parole board.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.028
- Cziller: This is why you asked us here?
- No, this is.

39:20.358 --> 39:23.601
This is a transcript of a new
interview with Sophie Feldman,

39:23.628 --> 39:27.303
and a statement from her mother admitting
the abuse allegation was false.

39:28.299 --> 39:31.803
- That's immaterial to my client's condition.
- Actually, it isn't.

39:31.836 --> 39:34.009
You see, if you read down here,

39:34.038 --> 39:38.680
the little girl mentions a
conversation she had with Dr. Webb--

39:38.710 --> 39:41.691
Charlie-- at her brother's bar mitzvah.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.193
Attorney: it still doesn't change anything.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.694
In his psychotic condition,

39:45.717 --> 39:48.357
nothing anyone said to my client
would've made a difference.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.027
- Let your own expert examine--
- We already know what ails him.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.400
Sara Lindstrom is a stunning woman.

39:58.863 --> 40:01.673
You leave her out of this.
She had nothing to do with it.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.269
She had everything to do with it.

40:03.301 --> 40:06.145
- He doesn't know what he's talking about.
- I know about love.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.650
You're not just nuts about her,
you're obsessive.

40:10.875 --> 40:14.914
( laughs ) You know this because you've
done a psychological work-up on me?

40:14.946 --> 40:18.985
- Maybe now is not the time.
- Why not? He's alert, he's coherent.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.759
Maybe he's over his "psychotic break."

40:21.786 --> 40:24.357
Listen to this amateur psychologist.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.062
I can afford to be an amateur.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.036
I've got Sara Lindstrom.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.802
- You what?
- She gave me the book on you.

40:32.830 --> 40:36.141
58 years old, divorced, no kids,

40:36.167 --> 40:39.080
nothing but your career to get you out of
the bed in the morning.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.241
I can't hear this.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.273
You’re staring at the abyss of old age,

40:42.307 --> 40:44.617
with no one to love, no one to love you.

40:44.642 --> 40:48.317
- Mr. Carver, if you don't shut him up—
- And then there she was.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.620
Check her out.

40:51.649 --> 40:54.926
(moaning)

40:54.953 --> 40:57.593
The kind of woman who-- ooh--

40:57.622 --> 41:00.228
well, frankly, guys like you never get.

41:00.258 --> 41:04.035
Not just because you're too old,
but because you're a geek,

41:04.062 --> 41:07.509
with your books and your tweed jacket.

41:07.532 --> 41:09.944
- I have plenty of lady friends.
- I'll bet.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.882
Claudia, Christy, Cindy--
all lined up for the likes of you.

41:13.905 --> 41:16.852
You probably looked at women like
Sara all your life and wondered,

41:16.874 --> 41:19.218
what does it take?

41:19.243 --> 41:22.053
Good looks, youth, money.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.720
Pow-- oh, it's power!

41:24.749 --> 41:27.059
That's what gets these women hot.

41:27.085 --> 41:30.032
And you don't have any.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.394
Sara's above all that.

41:33.424 --> 41:36.735
Sure, she likes her chocolates, tulips,

41:36.761 --> 41:38.900
$20,000 statues...

41:38.930 --> 41:42.343
14 phone calls a night?!

41:43.935 --> 41:45.539
- That was a mistake.
- No!

41:45.570 --> 41:48.073
No mistake.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.086
I've been there.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.088
Every man in this room has.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.919
You were 16 again,

41:53.945 --> 41:57.085
in your new sweet car...

41:58.950 --> 42:01.260
You never felt better in your life.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.595
You had to have her.

42:03.621 --> 42:06.033
Don't belittle my feelings
for Ms. Lindstrom.

42:06.057 --> 42:09.038
- Oh, I'm not. You tried everything.
- Within reason.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.199
Nobody's reasonable when they're in love.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.072
That's the whole point of it.

42:13.097 --> 42:14.974
But she wasn't loving you back.

42:14.999 --> 42:19.209
And you thought maybe
you weren't man enough, didn't you?

42:19.237 --> 42:20.875
No, no.

42:20.905 --> 42:23.351
You had to show her you were man enough.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.752
So you dug into your reptilian brain

42:25.777 --> 42:27.882
and this is what you came up with.

42:27.912 --> 42:31.325
Kill the wolf at the door,
throw the body at her feet

42:31.349 --> 42:34.421
and the gates of paradise will open wide!

42:34.452 --> 42:37.524
- Please, stop it.
- She will give herself to you.

42:37.555 --> 42:41.162
You'll be king of the world,
instead of a scared old man.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.763
Why do you-- you've seen her.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.670
Wouldn't you do anything?

42:57.775 --> 42:59.755
Don't you see?

43:01.746 --> 43:04.056
She was my last chance.

43:08.052 --> 43:10.532
Your client's not insane, he's in love.

43:10.555 --> 43:15.470
Maybe it's hard to tell the
two apart, but the law can.

43:15.493 --> 43:17.495
Here’s your proposal back.

43:18.729 --> 43:20.675
Now...

43:22.066 --> 43:24.068
Let's talk about mine.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.355
( theme music playing )
