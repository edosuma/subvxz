WEBVTT

01:27.045 --> 01:29.379
Bull's-eye, yeah.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.301
- Here, have a swig, man.
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.720
Come on, it's just beer, you pussy,
have a drink.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.388
All right, fine.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.647
- I love beer.
- Yeah, I can tell.

01:48.525 --> 01:52.236
I thought I told you to ditch
all this monster movie crap.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.322
- What's wrong with it?
- Jesus, Jeff.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.865
When are you gonna grow up?

01:56.908 --> 01:58.242
Getting you laid is hard enough

01:58.284 --> 02:01.995
without having to explain
the whole Bruce Campbell factor.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.540
What's wrong with Bruce Campbell?

02:05.583 --> 02:07.501
Death of the Dead?

02:07.585 --> 02:08.919
Maniac Cop?

02:10.463 --> 02:12.214
Moonwarp?

02:16.427 --> 02:20.013
Bruce Campbell is the greatest actor
of his generation!

02:20.098 --> 02:22.182
Man with the Screaming Brain.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.433
Alien Apocalypse.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.145
Oh, here's a good one, Cave Alien.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.688
That is a good one!

02:27.772 --> 02:30.232
Yeah, "Bruce Campbell is
Lieutenant Jack Stryker,

02:30.275 --> 02:34.611
"a rogue clone warrior and mankind's
last hope against the deadly cave aliens."

02:34.696 --> 02:36.446
Yeah. So?

02:36.489 --> 02:40.284
Dude, forget thumbs, Ebert wouldn't
wipe his crack with this trash.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.493
Get out of the car.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.163
- What?
- You don't like Bruce, you walk!

02:44.247 --> 02:46.123
Hey, take it easy, man.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.918
Besides, I kind of liked Bubba Ho-tep.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.462
Everyone liked Bubba Ho-tep!

02:52.505 --> 02:53.839
Calm down.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.468
Okay. All right, fine.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.307
- Now, can we please go get laid?
- All right.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.466
Holy shit.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.889
Boo!

03:43.973 --> 03:45.015
Dick!

03:45.058 --> 03:47.851
Dude,
just fucking with you. Come on.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.728
What the hell?

04:11.459 --> 04:14.127
You scream like a girl.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.213
Jeff, Little Debbie.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.464
Hey.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.216
Clayton, Big Debbie.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.427
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.806
Come on, let's go check out
this creepy graveyard.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.935
When I told the mascara queen
about this old graveyard,

04:30.019 --> 04:32.896
- she practically dry humped me on the spot.
- GIRLS: Yeah.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.358
- She's sort of cute.
- Yeah. Don't worry, hard on.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.776
Morticia's all yours.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.822
I'm gonna go practice my human fly
on little Miss Skyscraper over there.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.583
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.296
They look ancient, historic.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.758
Yeah, these graves have been around
since the cave-in of...

05:01.801 --> 05:03.593
A long time ago.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.263
Must have meant a lot to these people.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.766
Let's break something.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.562
As long as it's not my heart.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.605
What do you say?
Give me some sugar, baby.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.607
- What?
- Hey, look.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.028
We can play the hard to get all night,

05:21.112 --> 05:25.699
but if this game's called eye-tag,
your lips say I'm it.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.582
Your loss, baby.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.917
Your loss.

05:40.965 --> 05:45.135
So, why haven't I seen you around school?

05:45.219 --> 05:47.804
- That's 'cause I'm never there.
- Cool.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.059
- You seeing anybody?
- No.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.226
Cool.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.221
Groovy.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.396
Christ! Shit!

06:44.028 --> 06:46.029
Run! Get the hell out of here!

06:47.073 --> 06:48.240
Freak.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.420
Shit, Clayton, run!

07:01.504 --> 07:03.338
Yeah, right, Romeo.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.143
Shit!

07:19.480 --> 07:23.066
- What's up with that fucking lightning?
- That's heat lightning, baby.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.082
- Jeff, don't leave me!
- Come on, Clayton, run!

07:40.626 --> 07:43.295
Jeff! Jeff, don't leave me, man!

07:43.379 --> 07:44.838
Come on, man!

07:44.922 --> 07:46.923
Don't fucking leave me!

07:50.428 --> 07:53.096
No! No!

07:54.640 --> 07:55.765
Shit!

08:04.901 --> 08:08.445
What did I do?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.828
Hold it right there.

08:18.539 --> 08:22.501
What's wrong with you, Stryker?
We've got the cave alien cornered.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.629
Okay, so transmit the scans
up to Delta Baker,

08:25.671 --> 08:28.173
plant some bio blasters
and send out for Chinese.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.218
- Colonel Parker's still trapped down there.
- Cry me a river, toots.

08:31.302 --> 08:35.096
Last time I ran into Colonel Parker,
he had me in front of a firing squad!

08:36.474 --> 08:37.765
Coward!

08:37.808 --> 08:40.477
I should have left you on Regula Nine.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.314
You know you couldn't do that, baby.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.733
Yeah. That's right.

08:46.817 --> 08:51.321
You knew they built me
out of your old man's DNA, don't you?

08:51.364 --> 08:54.991
So I say we keep in the family
and start swapping some spit, ASAP.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.494
- You're disgusting.
- I'm a man.

08:57.578 --> 09:01.081
And I've wanted to do this
ever since we landed on this rock.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.639
Damn it! We're surrounded!

09:18.516 --> 09:20.350
Behind you! Look out!

09:20.434 --> 09:21.851
Get down!

09:24.188 --> 09:27.274
Watch out, watch out!
Take him out! Take him out!

09:28.859 --> 09:30.694
Can't you die?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.080
Cut! Cut!

09:42.164 --> 09:43.290
Cut!

09:51.299 --> 09:54.426
- Dude, light me, don't fight me.
- Hey, bite me.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.097
Bruce, that was sweet.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.558
Don't you think it was just,
I don't know, a little over the top?

10:01.642 --> 10:04.352
No, no, no. It was very Caligula
meets The Apple Dumpling Gang.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.729
That's not an answer.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.732
It was perfect for Cave Alien 2. Moving on!

10:11.736 --> 10:15.322
Hey, Tiny,
fetch me another lemon water, will you?

10:15.406 --> 10:18.408
- They just ran out, man.
- Well, then, dude, you run out, capiche?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.201
Come on, now.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.416
Nice job, baby.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.710
I'll tell you, what a relief,
on these down-and-dirty shows,

10:28.753 --> 10:30.003
to be working with a pro.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.671
I wouldn't know.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.760
Good.

10:36.844 --> 10:40.805
God damn it. "Get me some lemon water.
Give me some sugar, baby."

10:43.517 --> 10:44.768
Perfect.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.021
Get a load of this, bitch.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.401
Hey, I know this bar off Cahuenga
where the drinks are cheap,

10:53.444 --> 10:55.445
and, well, I'll be there.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.449
Hello?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.743
Oh, hello.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.037
No, you're not interrupting anything.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.872
At least think it over.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.500
Mr. Campbell, that refreshing lemon water
you asked for, sir.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.335
Thanks.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.461
Hey.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.799
- This is warm.
- Sir, I'm sorry.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.927
I'll make sure you get an ice-cold case
of it in your trailer by the morning.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.303
All right.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.806
You're lucky. See to it.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.851
Man, that's good.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.400
Boo.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.818
You're on.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.617
Hey, guys, how you doing? Here you go.
One for you. One for you.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.160
- Mr. Campbell? Mr. Campbell?
- Yeah.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.830
When you were in Army of Darkness,
when you were stuck down in the pit,

11:46.914 --> 11:48.164
how did you get your shotgun back?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.666
Talk to the writer, man, I don't know.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.459
Hey, when you worked with Ellen,
did it turn you gay?

11:51.502 --> 11:53.044
No, but your stupid question did.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.671
Why did you do Serving Sara?

11:54.714 --> 12:00.009
Why did I do Serving Sara?
For the money, mouth breather, why else?

12:00.052 --> 12:02.804
For the love of God, what is that stench?

12:03.973 --> 12:07.517
Here, it's called deodorant.
Look it up on your Internets.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.228
See you, boys. Late for a soirÃ©e.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.355
- Hey, Mr. Campbell?
- Yeah.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.315
Give me your autograph.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.195
- Got a pen?
- Why, you ain't got no pen?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.784
- What's your name?
- Gerard.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.870
Okay.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.539
Here you go, Gerard.
Have a good one, buddy.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.792
Yeah, hey, hey, hey.
That's Gerard with a "G."

12:38.340 --> 12:39.799
Here you go, Gerard.
Have a good one, buddy.

12:39.884 --> 12:45.054
Yeah, hey, Mr. Campbell, come on.
You got a more recent picture than this?

12:45.139 --> 12:46.389
Let me ask you something.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.099
- Ever see Rawhide?
- Yeah.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.517
- You like it?
- Yeah.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.895
Well, then you know
you gotta keep them doggies rolling.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.271
Hey!

12:54.440 --> 12:55.440
Freak.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.134
Nice rack.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.721
All right!

13:28.974 --> 13:30.558
Yeah, baby!

13:33.312 --> 13:36.773
Yo, baby cakes, how about a bourbon
with a loaded revolver back?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.359
How about you wait your turn, jerk?

13:41.779 --> 13:45.281
There's more where that came from.
Okay. All right. That's it.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.283
Good girl.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.873
You. You, give me some sugar, baby. You.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.376
Okay.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.877
Huh?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.964
- How you doing?
- Good. Good.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.423
- Hey, good news.
- Yeah?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.801
Yeah, I made the trades today.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.427
- Really?
- Yeah, check the obituaries.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.847
You'll find my career there.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.474
You know, Bruce, I just talked to the studio.

14:11.559 --> 14:15.353
They saw the dailies for Cave Alien 2.
They said you have never been better.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.897
Yeah, that's because
unlike most action stars,

14:17.982 --> 14:20.984
I can speak... What's the word? English.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.194
- Will that be cash?
- Oh, yeah, that'll be cash, all right.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.114
My friend and agent, Mr. Mills Toddner, here
will take care of that.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.658
That's perfect. You keep the change.
Don't be a stranger.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.494
- Sure, it's a special occasion.
- Yeah, it's a special occasion.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.997
It's the night I fire your polyester ass.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.166
Bruce, I'm sensing a little hostility
coming this way.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.002
Yeah? You think so?
Maybe that's because I've spent

14:39.086 --> 14:43.464
the last six days of my life making a sequel
to one of the crappiest movies ever.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.884
- You make lots of crappy movies.
- Oh, that doesn't help.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.677
Liquor! Liquor, please!

14:47.720 --> 14:50.847
Look, the customer reviews
on Amazon were great.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.683
Yeah, the ones you posted.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.520
BC, I sense that you wanna unload.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.107
I sense that you have a lot on your mind.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.860
So, I'm here. Give it to me.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.362
It's just that I think that...

15:07.698 --> 15:10.033
Excuse me. Gotta take this.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.712
Go on. I'm sorry.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.009
It's just that I think I'm losing my muse.
Do you know what I mean?

15:28.052 --> 15:32.388
The childlike, innocent quality
that all great artists tap to create.

15:32.473 --> 15:37.226
Now, if an actor's life is like a painting,
then it's a work in progress.

15:37.269 --> 15:41.689
But how can I create my great masterpiece
if my paint is drying up,

15:41.732 --> 15:42.982
my canvas is cracked

15:43.067 --> 15:46.361
and all my brushes
are covered with a fake monster blood?

15:46.403 --> 15:47.737
- It's Cheryl, isn't it?
- No.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.072
- It's Cheryl.
- I said no.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.115
- You can't stop thinking about her.
- If I say no three times,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.450
will the Candyman come out?

15:52.534 --> 15:54.911
You were fired before,
you're twice as fired now.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.581
Okay, you'll never know
what I got you for your birthday.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.042
My birthday?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.962
You actually remembered my birthday?

16:04.046 --> 16:07.215
Compadre, hello. Loco.

16:07.257 --> 16:11.719
I am your agent.
You are my number one client.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.765
- If this is another Matthew Perry movie...
- Better.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.850
- Give me a hint.
- But you fired me so...

16:17.935 --> 16:20.269
God damn it, Mills! Just tell me.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.438
Okay.

16:22.481 --> 16:27.860
Let's just say this is gonna be the best
birthday present you've ever had.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.112
- Nice.
- You're crazy.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.780
- No, you are.
- We're celebrating.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.532
I love you, man. How about it?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.201
Excuse me. I gotta take this. Sorry.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.452
Hello?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.250
Movie. Movie, movie.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.764
This bean curd's kind of watery and gross.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.808
Well, you did get
the winning goal, didn't you?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.310
- Yeah.
- Finish your bean curd.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.979
It's still gross.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.362
- What was that, Mom?
- I'm not sure, Skippy. You stay here.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.388
Must die!

17:48.692 --> 17:49.942
Sorry.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.086
I don't know why I'm complaining.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.421
I'm a lucky guy.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.090
I've got my health.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.052
Jesus!

18:16.136 --> 18:18.054
My divorce is final.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.056
Lousy whore.

18:20.140 --> 18:24.393
And I got my loyal fans,
who hated my last movie.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.146
Hated my last five movies. Yeah.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.858
Me and my wonderful, wonderful fans.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.472
That was easy.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.357
Hey, buddy.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.568
Hey, little Sam'n Rob.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.945
Come here, boy. Come on.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.906
What's the matter?

19:21.451 --> 19:23.828
You thought I forgot about you,
didn't you, huh?

19:23.912 --> 19:26.247
Time for some hooch. Come on!

19:26.290 --> 19:27.957
Hooch for the pooch.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.464
There you go. And some for Dad.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.140
What's on the boob tube?

19:48.979 --> 19:54.525
And now part nine of
an ongoing, exclusive, investigative series.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.611
Oh, who wants to watch that horseshit?

19:56.653 --> 19:58.654
Next, we take a scary look

19:58.697 --> 20:02.575
at the life and times of B-movie horror star
Bruce Campbell.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.493
Hey, I know that guy.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.830
Yeah, that's entertainment. I'll drink to that.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.709
Campbell, best known for his parts
in the horrific Evil Dead films,

20:11.793 --> 20:14.503
appears to have disappeared
from the entertainment scene.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.340
What?

20:17.424 --> 20:21.052
Tonight, our "Where Are They Now"
reporter, Charlie Payne,

20:21.136 --> 20:22.762
takes an affectionate look back

20:22.846 --> 20:27.516
on a promising career that many feel
was squandered on low-budget trash.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.352
You shut your face.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.193
They're treating me like I'm a has-been!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.908
Like I'm... Like I'm all washed up.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.918
They're trying to make me look pathetic.
Yeah, they are. Not me.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.380
Not me!

21:11.395 --> 21:12.770
Oh, God.

21:17.734 --> 21:21.195
- Hello?
- Hello, Cheryl. It's me.

21:23.240 --> 21:28.119
- Bruce, what now?
- Oh, I was just, you know,

21:28.203 --> 21:31.122
celebrating the almost wrap
of my latest movie.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.166
You know, just one more day.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.252
You got into the dog's bowl again,
didn't you?

21:37.421 --> 21:39.171
Shut up, you selfish mutt!

21:40.757 --> 21:42.591
It's your birthday, isn't it?

21:42.634 --> 21:46.554
Every year,
it's the same old "poor me" routine.

21:46.596 --> 21:50.433
Oh, come on, can't a guy get bombed
and call his ex-wife at 3:00 in the morning

21:50.475 --> 21:52.768
without it meaning something?

21:52.853 --> 21:55.938
Bruce, I talked to Mills today.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.941
Yeah? What did
old "Ten Percent" have to say?

21:59.026 --> 22:01.277
Oh, just that you were depressed.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.406
So he's planning something special
for your birthday.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.242
Yeah? Did he say what?

22:08.285 --> 22:09.910
No, no. It's a surprise.

22:09.953 --> 22:14.498
Oh, come on, Cheryl. Tell me.
Tell me, please, please, Cheryl.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.460
- I'm hanging up.
- No, no, no, don't. Don't, baby!

22:18.378 --> 22:19.754
I'm sorry.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.132
How did things get so messed up
between us?

22:23.300 --> 22:24.300
Oh...

22:24.426 --> 22:27.011
You slept with the dog sitter, Bruce.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.180
One lousy mistake.

22:29.264 --> 22:32.350
- All of them.
- Okay, 12 lousy mistakes.

22:32.434 --> 22:36.520
But come on, baby. I was confused then.
I'm fine now.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.607
God, I miss you and the kids.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.485
What kids?

22:42.527 --> 22:45.363
The ones we would have had
if you'd just hung on!

22:45.447 --> 22:47.823
You wanna know the truth about us, Bruce?

22:47.908 --> 22:50.826
It wasn't the cheating, or the boozing,

22:50.911 --> 22:54.246
or even the endless whining
that killed our marriage.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.956
You just couldn't commit,

22:55.999 --> 23:00.336
to your career, to our relationship,
to much of anything.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.964
So, the cheating, boozing
and endless whining were okay?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.848
- Who was that, baby?
- Oh, nobody.

23:13.934 --> 23:18.687
Come on, Millsy, introduce me
to big Jim one more time.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.065
I already set up the meeting.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.528
Let me make a call.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.000
What could you possibly want
at 4:30 in the morning?

23:40.043 --> 23:43.504
- Mr. Campbell, we need your help.
- I need my sleep.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.841
Sir, Gold Lick needs you.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.885
A group of teenagers
unwittingly unleashed Guan-Di,

23:49.970 --> 23:52.888
the Chinese god of war
and protector of the dead.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.058
And unless you help us stop him,
he will kill every one of us.

23:56.143 --> 23:59.520
Okay, settle down.
I'm gonna give you some advice, okay?

23:59.563 --> 24:02.481
Keep it under a-million-and-half,
get one name actor,

24:02.566 --> 24:05.734
and if you go straight to DVD,
you might break even.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.028
- Now, fuck off!
- Mr. Campbell!

24:08.572 --> 24:12.283
Oh, man, I've heard
some lame pitches in my day,

24:12.367 --> 24:14.201
but that takes the cake.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.248
I said get lost, you little...

24:23.503 --> 24:25.379
Huh. A quarter.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.615
What the hell?

25:35.659 --> 25:38.702
Hey! Hey, let me out of here!

25:39.162 --> 25:41.288
Mr. Campbell, are you okay?

25:41.331 --> 25:44.875
- Who... Who are you?
- This is Jeff.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.212
Look, I'm sorry about
the whole baseball bat thing.

25:49.464 --> 25:52.132
Look, I left some Twinkies back there.

25:54.135 --> 25:57.012
And there's a flashlight next to the spare.

25:57.973 --> 26:02.268
Oh, I also left an empty bottle back there,
if you need to, you know...

26:04.187 --> 26:07.940
Look, Mr. Campbell,
I know you're probably tired and sore,

26:08.024 --> 26:10.526
and suffering from a concussion,

26:10.569 --> 26:14.113
but is it true you're making a sequel
to Cave Alien?

26:14.197 --> 26:17.116
Oh, my God. He's a fan.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.953
It finally happened.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.247
Help! Help!

26:24.708 --> 26:28.711
Oh, for God's sake, kid,
at least go easy on the bumps!

26:28.795 --> 26:31.088
I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell, I'll do my best.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.816
- Gin.
- Dang it.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.234
That's three in a row, Edna.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.614
- What was that, Hank?
- I don't know.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.575
Sounded like something out by the barn.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.547
You close that door. You lock it.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.591
But, Hank,
what if you need to come back in?

27:15.634 --> 27:19.637
You just close that door,
and don't open it, no matter what you hear!

27:29.981 --> 27:32.107
Oh, Lord! Lord!

27:33.610 --> 27:36.820
Open the door! Open the door, Edna!

27:36.905 --> 27:39.615
But, Hank, you said don't open the door!

27:39.699 --> 27:42.117
For Christ's sake, woman,
we've been married for 35 years!

27:42.160 --> 27:44.328
Open the goddamn door!

27:45.955 --> 27:47.790
Got you!

27:47.874 --> 27:50.334
There weren't nothing out there.
I was just funning with you.

27:50.418 --> 27:54.505
You old fool,
I can't believe you got me like that.

27:54.589 --> 27:56.632
You should have seen the look on your face.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.814
"Hey, Luigi, paint the sign."

28:11.856 --> 28:14.817
I tell you something,
you paint the damn sign.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.568
But I do.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.117
Hmm.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.923
I paint a beauty sign.

29:10.290 --> 29:15.544
Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!

29:15.628 --> 29:17.963
Welcome to Gold Lick, Mr. Campbell!

29:18.882 --> 29:22.301
- Gold Lick? Where the fuck is Gold Lick?
- Hey, easy, man. That's the mayor.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.720
I don't give a shit
if he's the king of kiss-my-assy.

29:24.763 --> 29:29.391
I just spent the last six hours in a trunk
and I want some answers chop-chop, and I...

29:36.357 --> 29:37.941
Well, hello.

29:41.988 --> 29:45.908
Consider yourself officially exempt
from my wrath, sweet cakes.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.578
And if you're lucky, a little later,
I'll let you play with my boom stick.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.246
What?

29:51.289 --> 29:56.794
Now, I don't imagine you get
moving pictures here in this farthole,

29:56.878 --> 29:58.921
so let me explain something.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.798
What you just did,

30:00.882 --> 30:04.092
you just kidnapped a movie star,
you got that?

30:04.177 --> 30:06.762
So you didn't just
commit a crime against me,

30:06.846 --> 30:09.014
which was pretty freaking huge!

30:09.098 --> 30:12.059
You committed a crime against art itself.

30:12.101 --> 30:16.980
In fact, I was due back on the set
of my latest motion picture hours ago,

30:17.065 --> 30:18.982
and you can bet your bottom dollar

30:19.067 --> 30:22.194
they're gonna be doing everything they can
to get me back.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.280
What are we waiting for?

30:26.533 --> 30:29.368
A-hole Campbell didn't show up.
On to plan B, my friend.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.247
Okay, people, big energy. Let's go!

30:33.289 --> 30:34.540
DIRECTOR: Action!

30:38.044 --> 30:39.795
That's good.

30:42.674 --> 30:46.593
So as much as I'd love to hang around here

30:46.636 --> 30:49.972
until the FBI rips you grit-eaters
a new one...

30:50.014 --> 30:54.226
Mr. Campbell, I don't understand.
Your agent said you were free.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.353
What does my agent
have to do with any of this?

30:56.437 --> 31:00.649
Well, he just said not to book you
on your birthday, or something like that.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.150
My birthday?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.155
My birthday.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.369
My birthday, that's it.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.413
Mills, you magnificent bastard.

31:14.497 --> 31:18.625
When you said there was a surprise in store,
holy moley...

31:18.668 --> 31:20.168
That's a great tie, by the way.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.172
I gotta make a phone call. I'll be right back.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.841
Don't do anything quaint until I return.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.688
Mills Toddner's office.
- Yes, Mills Toddner, please.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.190
- Who's calling?
- Bruce Campbell.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.443
- Who?
- Bruce Campbell.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.404
- He's not here. Voicemail okay?
- Yeah, voicemail is fine.

31:47.488 --> 31:50.782
- MILLS: Mills, thrill me.
- Mills, listen, Campbell here.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.242
I gotta tell you, pal,

31:52.327 --> 31:53.619
this is, without a doubt,

31:53.703 --> 31:56.121
the most outrageous birthday present
I've ever gotten.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.706
So thanks, man.

31:57.790 --> 32:01.919
You're beautiful, and that whole firing thing,
what are you, crazy? It's a joke, come on.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.758
Now, I know you guys
probably can't break character,

32:07.842 --> 32:09.635
but I gotta tell you,

32:09.719 --> 32:12.804
man, you really had me going.
You really did.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.140
- I don't understand.
- Well, for a minute there,

32:15.224 --> 32:17.392
I thought I was in the sequel
of Deliverance, you know,

32:17.435 --> 32:19.686
and someone was about to say,
"Squeal like a pig, boy."

32:22.565 --> 32:25.567
Yes, there's no reason
beating around the bush,

32:25.610 --> 32:28.028
and I realize this is rather unorthodox but...

32:28.071 --> 32:31.448
Say no more, Mr. Mayor.
My hero senses are tingling.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.079
I sense that the town of Gold Lick
is in trouble.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.415
Huh? Big trouble and you need my help.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.708
Hmm?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.961
Do you? You need my help, Mr. Mayor?

32:44.045 --> 32:45.253
- Yes or no?
- That's exactly right.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.506
How about that?
Put the words right in your mouth, didn't I?

32:47.590 --> 32:50.092
But not just any help, huh?

32:50.176 --> 32:52.427
You need someone special,

32:52.470 --> 32:54.930
someone who can take on
a heinous monster

32:55.014 --> 32:58.767
and stop him in his tracks
and take him to justice.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.435
That would be me. Whoa!

33:01.938 --> 33:05.107
Mr. Mayor, your worries are over

33:05.149 --> 33:08.860
'cause there's a new sheriff in town
and he's gonna clean up this mess.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.406
Gold Lick, it's a good day. I'm here to help!

33:12.448 --> 33:14.449
Let's hear it for Mr. Bruce Campbell.

33:14.534 --> 33:19.538
Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!

33:19.622 --> 33:22.791
Now, it's just another day
in the life of a hero.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.628
Mr. Mayor, tell us what's next.

33:26.671 --> 33:30.257
We'd like to show you
exactly what you're up against.

33:59.829 --> 34:05.250
Leather, red leather, yellow leather,
red, yellow, red leather, yellow leather.

34:07.920 --> 34:08.962
Ow!

34:09.005 --> 34:11.380
- My foot!
- Pardon me there, Gomer Pyle.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.925
- Jesus!
- Oh, excuse me, Goober.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.388
Boy, this is exciting, huh?

34:18.473 --> 34:21.099
- Think they'll give me the key to the city?
- I doubt it.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.893
How about the key to your place?

34:22.976 --> 34:26.188
I'm sorry, we haven't met. I'm Kelly Graham.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.649
Graham? Well, I'll bet all the boys
go cracker over you.

34:30.818 --> 34:33.360
That was funny when I was six.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.031
Well, I was six once.
Hey, we already have something in common.

34:37.992 --> 34:42.204
Oh, heck. I'm... I'm Bruce. Bruce Campbell.

34:42.246 --> 34:46.123
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Jeff's been bragging about you for years.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.333
Ah...

34:47.376 --> 34:50.629
- Uber fan's connected to you, huh?
- I'm afraid so.

34:51.297 --> 34:54.674
- Younger brother?
- Son.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.637
- Young mother.
- It's a country thing.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.180
Oh, hey, a MILF is a MILF.

35:02.725 --> 35:04.851
But I don't see a wedding ring.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.145
Are you married or happy, Kelly Graham?

35:07.230 --> 35:10.107
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
answering that.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.567
Mr. Campbell, if you're ready.

35:12.610 --> 35:16.029
Yeah, knock yourself out, chief.
Showtime, huh?

35:16.072 --> 35:18.824
Mr. Treppin, let's start the slide show.

35:22.411 --> 35:26.498
As we all know,
Gold Lick is a mining community.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.253
In the late 1850s,

35:31.295 --> 35:35.674
hundreds of Chinese immigrants
came to our shores to help work the claims.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.765
At her height, the Triple-T mine

35:43.850 --> 35:46.768
employed hundreds
of Chinese immigrant laborers.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.105
They worked long hours,
in primitive conditions,

35:50.148 --> 35:52.983
surviving on rice and bean curd.

35:54.735 --> 35:55.735
Oh!

36:11.586 --> 36:13.795
Then disaster struck.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.046
You want disaster?

36:15.131 --> 36:17.132
Anyone here seen Assault on Dome 4?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.301
- That's probably my favorite movie...
- Don't answer that.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.136
A mine shaft cave-in.

36:21.804 --> 36:27.142
Over a hundred Chinese were buried alive
and remain there today.

36:28.102 --> 36:31.479
Gold Lick has never been the same since.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.358
That guy's pretty good.
Did he come from dinner theater?

36:35.443 --> 36:36.860
No, Iowa.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.239
You know, they go to all that trouble
to kidnap somebody,

36:41.324 --> 36:44.951
I'd have kidnapped that Jake character
from Evil Dead ll.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.412
My money'd bet on that blacksmith
from Army of Darkness.

36:47.496 --> 36:50.165
- Now, that's one stud.
- Damn straight.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.920
I wish I could quit you.

36:55.546 --> 36:59.007
Soon after,
rumors began to spread of a curse.

37:01.093 --> 37:04.304
Okay. When did my ex-wife start modeling?

37:04.347 --> 37:06.181
Mom, that's it. That's the thing.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.643
Legend has it that
a Chinese demon was summoned

37:09.685 --> 37:12.979
to protect the spirits
of all those who had died.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.359
Mom.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.866
A warning.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.203
He who would confront Guan-Di,

37:29.080 --> 37:32.832
would also confront death itself.

37:33.709 --> 37:37.045
- Well, hello, Mr. Plaitpoint.
- His name is Wing.

37:37.088 --> 37:41.049
He's one of the last surviving descendents
of the dead laborers.

37:41.133 --> 37:45.095
Guan-Di has been unleashed from his grave.

37:45.888 --> 37:48.765
I'm sorry, was that "unreashed"?

37:48.849 --> 37:50.600
Unleashed, unleashed.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.561
What's the matter?
Don't you speak English?

37:53.646 --> 37:58.358
Guan-Di, great warrior.
Guan-Di, protector of dead,

37:58.401 --> 38:03.238
savior of the innocent and the bean curd.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.865
Bean curd? What...

38:07.410 --> 38:10.078
Bean curd's a popular Chinese dish. You...

38:10.121 --> 38:13.081
You chatter like monkey.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.709
I call you Chattering Monkey.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.634
His grave has been disturbed.

38:25.219 --> 38:28.263
And Guan-Di will not stop
until every last relative

38:28.347 --> 38:32.559
of the one who did this
lay rotting in the earth.

38:32.601 --> 38:36.104
Well, hell, what could be so bad about that?

38:36.188 --> 38:38.940
Okay, blood relatives, raise your hand.

38:40.484 --> 38:43.653
Guan-Di knows that you and I
are not related, right?

38:44.572 --> 38:47.282
I shall do an ancient Chinese dance,

38:47.325 --> 38:50.869
which will rid you all
of the curse of Guan-Di.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.298
Has he been dispelled? No?

39:03.382 --> 39:05.759
Okay, you're all going to die.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.761
But know this,

39:07.803 --> 39:11.765
Guan-Di grows stronger
with every person he kills,

39:11.807 --> 39:16.478
until all of you will die!

39:21.484 --> 39:23.943
Will die!

39:30.368 --> 39:31.910
He's gone!

39:33.496 --> 39:35.997
No, no. Actually, he's... He's right...

39:37.666 --> 39:41.711
Well, folks, it looks like
the presentation is over.

39:41.796 --> 39:46.758
Just be careful on your way home,
and look out for your neighbors.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.553
Boy, that was exciting.

39:53.349 --> 39:57.268
As you can see, Mr. Campbell,
the future of Gold Lick rests in your hands.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.187
We sure appreciate you being here.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.940
We were thinking you might want
to freshen up and get a bite to eat

40:02.024 --> 40:03.441
before you lead us into battle.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.318
Mr. Mayor, that's a good idea.

40:05.361 --> 40:09.072
'Cause I always freshen up
before I go into battle and kill monsters.

40:09.156 --> 40:13.201
- You don't want to leave a bad impression.
- Lordy, you're good people.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.207
You're welcome to wash up at my tavern.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.585
Well, that's good 'cause,
as you can see, I'm a dirty little boy.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.463
Oh, oh, yeah,
and I've got a nice little place upstairs.

40:25.548 --> 40:28.133
You can wait there until dinner
and no one will hassle you or anything.

40:28.217 --> 40:31.052
Well, Jeff, if you insist.

41:20.769 --> 41:23.480
I'd say the only thing missing
is the stool sample.

41:23.564 --> 41:27.025
- Yeah, I guess I am kind of a fan.
- Yeah, do you think?

41:30.404 --> 41:33.740
- That's not familiar.
- Hey, hey. That's personal.

41:33.782 --> 41:37.577
Look, Mr. Campbell,
I fixed you up a room back here.

41:37.620 --> 41:41.080
I gave you some fresh towels
and clothes and...

41:41.123 --> 41:44.083
Look, I know this is
a big imposition for you so

41:44.126 --> 41:47.921
whatever I can do to make feel you at home,
just let me know, okay?

41:50.132 --> 41:54.636
First of all, kid, Mr. Campbell makes soup.
My name is Bruce.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.471
Secondly, you wanna get on my good side,

41:56.555 --> 41:59.641
you'll dig up a bar of soap
and a bottle of Jack,

41:59.725 --> 42:01.059
and not in that order.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.314
Nothing like a shower
to wash the blues away.

42:10.319 --> 42:13.655
Jeff, where the heck
did you find this Evil Dead shampoo?

42:14.782 --> 42:16.824
Bruce, that's drain cleaner.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.159
Oh...

42:18.202 --> 42:21.287
Maybe that would explain
the burning sensation.

42:23.832 --> 42:25.083
What?

42:25.751 --> 42:29.462
Well, it's just that
you're going up against Guan-Di tonight

42:29.505 --> 42:32.006
and you're not even scared.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.884
You don't know fear, kid.
You never worked with Sam Raimi.

42:34.969 --> 42:39.305
You know, compared to most hell spawn,
this Guan-Di cat's no biggie-mo.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.890
- Really?
- Nah.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.684
You know, in the hero business,

42:42.726 --> 42:44.852
you only really
have to remember two things.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.022
One, most monsters
are just a guy in a rubber suit.

42:48.065 --> 42:51.150
Two, you can't fight a guy in a rubber suit
on an empty stomach.

42:51.193 --> 42:54.362
So this particular hero
needs some food and some drink.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.585
There's Bruce Campbell.

43:19.972 --> 43:23.308
- Pick your poison, Mr. Campbell.
- Oh, I hardly ever touch the stuff.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.018
- It's on the house.
- Well, in that case,

43:25.060 --> 43:27.812
I'll take a slow screw against the wall
and make it a double.

43:27.896 --> 43:29.606
Maybe this is all a big joke to you,

43:29.690 --> 43:31.232
but Jeff's talked the whole town
into thinking

43:31.317 --> 43:33.359
you're gonna save us from this Guan-Di.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.652
Yeah, and?

43:34.737 --> 43:37.405
And as far as I can tell,
you're pretty much full of shit.

43:37.489 --> 43:39.449
Sounds to me like
you're wandering from the script, sister.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.826
Didn't you read the fine print?
Never piss off the hero.

43:41.910 --> 43:43.911
Hey, hey, Kelly's been known
to speak her mind.

43:43.996 --> 43:47.582
Sounds to me like she needs to be recast.
She adlibs too much.

43:47.666 --> 43:49.917
Walk with me, Mr. Campbell.
Walk, walk with me.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.378
You know, if I wanted to take shit
from a bunch of bogus actors,

43:52.421 --> 43:54.088
I'd go back to LA.

43:54.173 --> 43:57.258
- Get that out of my face.
- Sure, sure, I understand, Mr. Campbell.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.177
But you see,
Kelly's been through a rough patch.

43:59.261 --> 44:02.263
Her whining, cheating, boozing husband
left her and Jeff in the lurch,

44:02.306 --> 44:04.057
and she just hasn't been herself lately.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.099
Go ahead and have a seat.

44:06.101 --> 44:09.103
We're gonna treat you so many ways,
you're bound to like one.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.897
And we appreciate you being here.

44:10.939 --> 44:13.399
Yeah, you could have spelled
my name right.

44:19.448 --> 44:22.575
Hey, Kelly, like it or not,
that man is our salvation.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.744
Good gravy, you've got to play ball.

44:24.787 --> 44:27.246
He's talking like he's crazy,
like none of this is real.

44:27.289 --> 44:30.833
You know, great warriors are often
on a different plane than you and I.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.502
Service, please.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.423
Eccentricity is often the brother
to greatness.

44:37.466 --> 44:40.093
And obnoxiousness is often the brother
of a black eye.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.470
Oh, I admit, he is bit of an odd duck,

44:42.554 --> 44:46.140
but hopefully, he'll be gone lickety-split
and we can get back to our normal life.

44:46.183 --> 44:47.558
I just hope you're right.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.936
Could it possibly get worse?

44:49.978 --> 44:51.813
May I have another sarsaparilla?

45:12.668 --> 45:15.044
Ding, ding. Can you fill her up, buddy?

45:20.801 --> 45:23.344
Oh, for crying out loud.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.850
Hey, sometime today would be great.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.399
Hey, you old ball sack,
I've been honking for you.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.067
I want some gas.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.867
Oh, I got you.

45:45.951 --> 45:49.036
You're still upset
about your little sister, Wanda.

45:49.079 --> 45:53.666
Well, truth is, it was late, she was lonely,

45:53.709 --> 45:55.960
and I was using my wrong head.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.553
Jesus Christ.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.097
Please!

46:21.653 --> 46:23.571
Can't a guy get something to eat
around here?

46:28.869 --> 46:30.787
Time for some dancing.

46:37.586 --> 46:40.338
Ma'am, may I have this dance?

46:40.422 --> 46:42.882
- Do you believe in reincarnation?
- Why?

46:42.925 --> 46:45.301
Because it's not gonna happen
in this lifetime.

46:45.385 --> 46:48.846
Well, there's a cold wind blowing
in Gold Lick tonight.

46:51.350 --> 46:54.894
What's the matter?
Can't you take a joke, Mr. Actor Boy?

46:56.396 --> 46:58.815
I'd love to dance with you.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.902
- Do you really mean that?
- Like my life depended on it.

47:12.704 --> 47:14.914
Now, I've gotta warn you,
I'm not a very good dancer.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.542
Oh, I'll bet all you country girls
say the same thing.

47:17.626 --> 47:19.752
Come on, show me some stuff.

47:22.506 --> 47:23.798
Hey!

47:23.882 --> 47:25.007
Whoa!

47:26.927 --> 47:28.177
Hey!

47:33.475 --> 47:36.519
Why, you weren't kidding. You really suck.

47:36.603 --> 47:38.771
Oh, well, let's see how the city boy fares.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.566
All right. Yeah. Round we go!

47:43.193 --> 47:45.444
Watch us go!

47:49.408 --> 47:51.117
You all right, honey?

47:51.159 --> 47:53.995
I've heard of break dancing,
but this is ridiculous.

47:54.079 --> 47:56.205
Oh, I hope you're a better actor
than you are a dancer.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.040
Obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.502
- Maybe we should try something together.
- You better lead.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.966
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.302
Hey, everybody, we're dancing!

48:15.851 --> 48:18.853
Hey, lady, 10 cents a ride, no exceptions.

48:20.230 --> 48:21.856
- Hey, what was that?
- Nothing.

48:21.940 --> 48:25.484
Oh, no. Corners of your mouth
turned up at the edges.

48:25.527 --> 48:27.653
There's an old Indian saying
for that phenomena.

48:29.865 --> 48:34.410
That's Cherokee for "She who smiles at one
she no longer continues to hate."

48:34.494 --> 48:36.454
Oh, shut up and dance.

48:42.920 --> 48:46.505
Well, I don't know about you,
but I could use some fresh air.

48:46.548 --> 48:49.759
- Oh, me, too, and just fresh air.
- Of course.

48:51.261 --> 48:55.097
Even after everything that's happened,
God, I love this place.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.726
Yeah, I grew up in a town just like it.
Little Place in Michigan.

48:58.810 --> 49:00.478
- Ever hear of it?
- Michigan?

49:00.562 --> 49:04.106
- No, Little Place, it's just north of Flint.
- Oh, sounds nice.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.525
I made my first movie there
when I was still in high school.

49:06.568 --> 49:07.693
Really?

49:07.736 --> 49:10.029
Oh, we were young and naive,

49:10.072 --> 49:13.908
and we wanted to make a movie
that represented our hopes and dreams.

49:13.992 --> 49:17.078
- What was it called?
- Blade of the Skull Ripper.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.831
- That's when I got the acting bug.
- Oh, you've come a long way since then.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.875
You haven't seen much of my recent stuff,
I guess.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.753
Well, believe it or not,
Jeff has shown me a couple.

49:25.837 --> 49:29.423
I don't know about the plots,
but you're usually pretty good in them.

49:29.466 --> 49:33.427
- You really mean that?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

49:33.512 --> 49:36.180
Well, you're just full of surprises,
aren't you, Kelly Graham?

49:36.264 --> 49:38.265
Well, here's one for you.

49:39.518 --> 49:44.522
I actually think I'm a little shy.
That's why I come on so strong.

49:44.606 --> 49:47.400
Oh, hey, I came on kind of strong myself.

49:49.444 --> 49:51.654
It's not easy for me to...

49:52.155 --> 49:53.364
Yes?

49:54.992 --> 49:57.910
...express my true feelings.

50:01.289 --> 50:03.416
You want to move that hand?

50:07.879 --> 50:12.633
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- Yeah, well, I'll let it slide, this time.

50:19.808 --> 50:21.392
Mr. Campbell.

50:21.476 --> 50:24.770
Sure, Mr. Mayor, of course.
Just give me five minutes.

50:24.813 --> 50:25.855
It's time.

50:25.939 --> 50:28.649
For the love of God,
I can smell her ChapStick!

50:31.486 --> 50:34.113
I'm so gonna take a rain check.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.906
All right, come on.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.832
All right, small-town America,
show me what you got.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.918
Well, no matter which way you wanna go,
Mr. Campbell,

50:48.003 --> 50:50.421
- I think we got you covered.
- All right.

50:50.505 --> 50:53.674
You might want to slip
this little Beretta.22 in your pocket.

50:53.717 --> 50:57.011
It's for that close range,
last-minute desperation stuff.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.971
- What's your name?
- Frank.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.390
Frank, nice gun, for a girl.

51:01.475 --> 51:04.310
- You want to step it up a bit, do you?
- Hello.

51:05.854 --> 51:09.190
This.45 long-slide "Widow Maker."

51:09.858 --> 51:11.859
I think it'll be just right for you.

51:11.902 --> 51:13.861
Close, Frank, but no cigar.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.697
- Well, if it's accuracy you want...
- Duh.

51:18.033 --> 51:20.159
That's a Marlin 336.

51:20.202 --> 51:23.537
Shoot a pig's eye out from 1,000 yards.

51:23.622 --> 51:25.581
And who wouldn't wanna do that?

51:25.665 --> 51:27.666
Frank, you're holding out on me. Come on.

51:27.709 --> 51:30.544
Well, then again, if you're taking out
the Chinese god of war...

51:30.629 --> 51:32.379
And we are.

51:32.464 --> 51:36.717
...wrap your hands around this
Parker 12-gauge, double-barrel beauty.

51:39.471 --> 51:42.098
That's for people that don't call 911.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.227
I think we get the idea, Frank,
and thanks for that,

51:46.311 --> 51:49.563
but I'd be willing to wager that Mr. Campbell
is more than capable of telling us

51:49.606 --> 51:52.399
which weapons should be used
under the circumstances.

51:52.442 --> 51:55.945
- Of course. I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
- That's okay.

51:56.029 --> 51:58.989
Go ahead, Mr. Campbell,
tell us exactly what we need.

51:59.074 --> 52:04.954
Well, I... Don't you think Frank really
said it all with the guns and everything? I...

52:05.038 --> 52:08.124
Of course, for personal protection,
you may have never heard of this gun,

52:08.208 --> 52:14.046
but I always
use a...permanent press.

52:14.756 --> 52:17.091
But I can see that you
obviously don't have that gun here,

52:17.134 --> 52:21.595
so I'll just have to limp along
with this.31 long-bow.

52:21.680 --> 52:22.972
.45 long-slide.

52:23.056 --> 52:27.101
Long-slide, like I said.
So, come on, Gold Lick, get your guns.

52:27.185 --> 52:29.436
Give me a big one.
Take it easy.

52:29.479 --> 52:30.980
One at a time.

52:31.064 --> 52:33.732
- Bruce, can I show you something?
- Sure.

52:33.775 --> 52:36.402
We got you covered. All right, look at us.

52:36.444 --> 52:38.028
My goodness me.

52:38.989 --> 52:43.742
- Now we can slide off to San Francisco.
- And I'm riding shotgun.

52:46.621 --> 52:49.123
I thought you might wanna use this.

52:53.628 --> 52:55.588
I had it made special.

52:55.964 --> 52:59.884
Briggs & Stratton two-stroke, half-inch claw.

52:59.968 --> 53:03.846
- What do you think?
- Wow, it's really something.

53:05.473 --> 53:07.057
You know, Jeff,

53:07.726 --> 53:11.020
I've gotten a lot of use
out of chainsaws over the years,

53:11.104 --> 53:15.149
killed a lot of zombies, saved a lot of lives.

53:16.318 --> 53:19.737
But at the end of the day,
when push comes to shove,

53:19.821 --> 53:21.405
they're just too damn heavy.

53:21.489 --> 53:24.909
So thanks just the same, kid.
See you out there.

53:27.204 --> 53:30.039
- Yeah.
- Don't be late.

53:36.504 --> 53:38.005
All right.

53:38.089 --> 53:39.673
- You guys ready for some violence?
Yeah!

53:39.716 --> 53:41.675
That's right. All right.

53:43.178 --> 53:45.763
- Sure you're ready for this, Bruce?
- Kid, I made a movie in Bulgaria.

53:45.847 --> 53:49.683
I'm ready for anything.
Put yourself on ice, sugar lips,

53:49.726 --> 53:51.518
because when I come back,
I'm gonna lay claim

53:51.603 --> 53:53.979
to the prettiest pair of green eyes
I've ever seen.

53:54.022 --> 53:55.731
Let's do this thing!

53:55.815 --> 53:57.274
Be careful.

53:58.109 --> 54:00.319
And my eyes are brown!

54:00.362 --> 54:01.695
Dumb shit.

54:10.580 --> 54:12.581
All right, folks, listen up.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.833
It could get ugly out there tonight.

54:14.876 --> 54:16.627
Real ugly.

54:16.711 --> 54:20.214
So if something happens
and you don't think you're gonna make it,

54:20.257 --> 54:21.674
just remember this,

54:21.716 --> 54:23.842
even though
you don't have medical insurance,

54:23.885 --> 54:26.053
emergency rooms
are mandated by federal law

54:26.137 --> 54:27.680
to treat critically-injured patients.

54:27.722 --> 54:31.141
So, technically,
you got nothing to worry about.

54:31.226 --> 54:33.352
Aside from that,
Bruce Campbell's got your back.

54:33.395 --> 54:34.895
All right!
- Yeah!

54:34.938 --> 54:38.399
Now, come on, Gold Lick,
let's kick some Guan-Di butt!

54:45.365 --> 54:48.575
Oh, yeah. This is Henderson.
I'm crossing Old Stage Road.

54:48.660 --> 54:50.286
No sign of the demon, over.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.788
Oh, my God, Henderson,
he's right behind you.

54:53.957 --> 54:55.040
Oh, Jesus!

54:56.209 --> 54:58.752
- Just kidding, chief!
- That ain't funny.

55:03.675 --> 55:06.510
Jeff, after this is over,
I gotta meet your sound guy.

55:06.594 --> 55:07.928
We don't have a sound guy.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.014
All right, we're gonna try
and smoke him out.

55:10.098 --> 55:12.808
He's got a sword, over!
- Stay your course, Chicken Little.

55:12.892 --> 55:14.476
Oh, he's a big sucker!

55:14.561 --> 55:16.603
Well, what do you expect?
He's the Chinese god of war.

55:16.688 --> 55:20.024
Oh, no, he's spotted me.
He's coming to fight!

55:20.108 --> 55:21.817
No! No!

55:23.361 --> 55:25.321
Give it a rest, Shatner.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.956
Bruce, do something!

55:39.502 --> 55:42.004
- What the fuck is that?
- It's Guan-Di!

55:42.088 --> 55:45.883
- You mean the son-of-a-bitch is real?
- Shouldn't we shoot it?

55:49.012 --> 55:52.473
No! No! No!

55:52.515 --> 55:54.266
Retreat!

55:57.354 --> 56:01.523
Bruce, where are you going?
- Shoot it! Shoot it!

56:08.698 --> 56:09.990
Daddy?

56:12.077 --> 56:13.452
Daddy?

56:15.038 --> 56:18.499
My ear.
Stop shooting! Stop shooting!

56:23.671 --> 56:25.339
GUAN-Dl: Must die!

56:27.342 --> 56:29.134
Keys! Keys!
Come on, it's the country.

56:29.177 --> 56:31.345
Don't you keep your
fucking keys in your trucks?

56:36.476 --> 56:37.559
All right.

56:39.521 --> 56:41.980
Coil wire to the ignition.

56:42.607 --> 56:44.691
What could possibly go wrong?

56:47.695 --> 56:49.363
Oh, man!

56:49.406 --> 56:51.073
That always worked in the movies.

57:00.708 --> 57:02.584
Hey! Hey! Hey!

57:02.669 --> 57:04.044
Thank you.

57:05.004 --> 57:08.882
Give me back my bike, you old prick!
And McHale's Navy sucked.

57:22.897 --> 57:25.274
Young man, are you all right?

57:26.067 --> 57:29.278
Lady, you gotta give me
a ride out of here right now.

57:29.362 --> 57:33.073
- I'm sorry, but there's no room.
- Oh, yeah, there is.

57:33.116 --> 57:37.411
Oh, yeah. Get out of there.
Get out of there! Get out of here!

57:45.503 --> 57:48.297
Oh, my kitty! My kitty cat!

57:51.176 --> 57:52.926
Oh, you horrible man!

57:52.969 --> 57:55.554
And you were the worst thing
about Moontrap!

57:57.557 --> 58:01.310
"Yeah. Come to Gold Lick.
Help us fight a monster."

58:01.394 --> 58:03.854
What the hell were they thinking?

58:04.230 --> 58:07.191
Now the supernatural son-of-a-bitch
is after me.

58:07.275 --> 58:10.360
Oh, man. I gotta blow this pop stand fast.

58:11.779 --> 58:12.946
Oh!

58:14.073 --> 58:17.618
I'm so screwed!
Oh, that cheapskate old lady.

58:23.041 --> 58:24.666
Hey, guys.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.462
I need a car, pronto!

58:28.505 --> 58:31.798
Hey, ain't you that demon-fighting
son-of-a-bitch?

58:31.925 --> 58:33.300
Yeah, I am.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.844
I came back 'cause I needed
some garbage bags

58:35.929 --> 58:37.638
and shovels 'cause we killed...

58:37.722 --> 58:40.682
Hold that thought, guys. Nice talking to you.

58:42.143 --> 58:45.562
Suckers! You won't have me
to kick around anymore.

58:45.647 --> 58:50.317
You can take this little crappy-ass town
and shove it right up...

58:50.360 --> 58:52.444
Hey, hey. What...

58:56.658 --> 58:58.283
- Bruce.
- Yeah?

58:58.326 --> 58:59.826
- Where's Jeff?
- Jeff...

58:59.869 --> 59:01.620
What, you just left him out there?

59:01.663 --> 59:03.747
Well, that depends on what the definition
of "out there" is.

59:03.831 --> 59:07.167
And you know, lady, you never told me
that this monster was real!

59:07.210 --> 59:08.585
Shoe lace.

59:10.797 --> 59:13.173
There he is!
Stop that truck!

59:19.514 --> 59:20.847
Mom!

59:22.767 --> 59:24.309
Where's Bruce?

59:25.436 --> 59:27.229
Stop that truck!

59:39.701 --> 59:41.702
He's just a damn coward.

59:45.540 --> 59:48.750
I've been here five years, nobody die.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.877
Now, everybody die.

59:58.052 --> 01:00:01.888
Nobody else better die.
You're gonna have to answer to Luigi.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.933
Oh, shit.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:08.270
There's some crazy shit
going down in this town.

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:16.695
What are you gonna do with that?

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080
Huh?

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:26.932
Cute little Samâ€™n Rob.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.561
At least I still have you. Come here, boy.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:32.646
Come on.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:36.024
You son-of-a-bitch!

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.321
Maybe I'll feel better after breakfast.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.324
It's the most important meal of the day.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:47.160
This is
Bruce Campbell, actor extraordinaire.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.789
If you're young, female
and not currently incarcerated,

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:54.918
page me at star-998,
otherwise, leave a message after the tone.

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:57.671
Bruce, it's Cheryl.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:58.797
Cheryl?

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.049
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you,

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:04.219
something that's been weighing on me
ever since our divorce.

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:05.762
Well, of course I forgive you!

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.724
It's the alimony payment.
It's just not cutting it.

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:10.517
Huh?

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:13.061
So my lawyer's filed a motion
to have it increased,

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.147
along with a fresh restraining order,

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:18.650
so don't even try returning this call,
you fuck head.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:24.489
You heartless hell-spawn!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:28.160
Sleep with the scorpions, bitch!

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:31.830
Who does she think she is?

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:36.918
Think I'm some low-budget, two-bit actor?
Tell you what...

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:44.760
"From the desk of Mills Toddner.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.054
"Pack your bags, baby.
Back-to-back in Bulgaria.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:53.477
"Cave Alien 3 and 4."

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.229
Oh, no!

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.900
No!

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.193
Help me!

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.993
Hang on a second.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:18.710
What the hell do you want? I'm busy.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:21.755
Hi, I'm Kasey,
the famous singing prostitute.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.716
I'm here to offer birthday greetings
and wish you lots of luck

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.968
And if you're really, really lucky
I'll even toss in a...

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:29.346
Oh, God, whoa, whoa. Who sent you?

01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:35.310
"From your friend and agent, Mills Toddner.
Here's some birthday sugar, baby."

01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:38.438
That's it? That was my special gift?
A woman?

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.942
Actually, I'm only half-way through
my transgender surgeries, so technically...

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:44.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
For the love of God, just stop!

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.540
- Campbell residence.
- Bruce, it's Jeff.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.292
You little bastard.

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:00.961
You're the one
who dragged me into this nightmare.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:04.256
Now, what, are you calling
to chew my ass out for taking a powder?

01:04:04.298 --> 01:04:08.009
No, I... I just wanted to thank you.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.803
Thank me? For what?

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.264
For teaching me the meaning of courage.

01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:15.851
- I ran like cheap mascara.
- Well, that's just it.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:19.396
While I was trying to dodge my
responsibilities by dumping them on you,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.691
you showed me
I have to face this thing on my own.

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:24.693
Yeah.

01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:28.613
I'm glad you learned the error
of your ways, kid, yeah.

01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:31.992
I'm the one who unleashed Guan-Di.
It's up to me to kill it.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:36.329
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're gonna take on
Toshiro McFuckhead solo?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.331
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.585
All I needed was a push.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:45.046
No, no! Kid! Kid!

01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:48.675
- Son-of-a...
- Boyfriend troubles?

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:49.885
No!

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:53.388
Stupid kid's gonna get himself killed!

01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:56.433
What do I care? I got problems of my own.

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:01.479
- Who are you?
- I'm your good nature, Bruce.

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:03.273
Now, you heed my warning.

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:06.568
If Jeff goes up against Guan-Di
all by himself,

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.194
oh, he'll be cut to ribbons.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.780
You've got to help the dear boy!

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:14.200
Oh, don't listen to him! Kid's an asshole!

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.828
Fuck him! Nobody lives forever!

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:20.373
How can you say such a thing?
You awful devil.

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:23.168
I got something for you right here, angel.

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.545
Bruce, you've got to help Jeff.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.672
He's your biggest fan!

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.385
Get out of here, you freaks!
- I'm flying!

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:37.265
You, Nurse Ratched,
how would you like to make $100?

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:39.476
Story of my life.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.897
- No, no, no. I need a ride.
- That's why I'm here.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.398
In your car.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:50.236
- Kinky.
- No, I need a ride to a town called Gold Lick.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:54.032
I need to kill me a Guan-Di.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.839
Keep away from him, honey.
- All right. Now, stay here.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.634
Try not to blow anybody till I get back.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.569
Hey, Kelly!

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.447
Why don't you go home?

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:40.120
Go find yourself some fake Hollywood girl
'cause you and me were never real.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.414
Kelly, please.

01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:46.626
I'm not one of those shallow sex machines
like all those other Hollywood types.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.295
Hey, mister, you still owe me $100!

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.965
And we still have to have sex!

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.887
Would you excuse me for just a second?

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:02.684
For the love of God,
just take the money and go.

01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:06.646
Oh, I'll take a rain check
on the ex-say a little ater-lay.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:08.273
Whatever, dude.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:15.613
Kelly, look, we don't have much time...

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:17.323
Hey, that's all my stuff.

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:20.660
Yeah, well, Jeff asked me to purge his loft.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.287
It was my pleasure.

01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:25.206
Oh, sweet Jesus! That's a limited edition!

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.543
Plenty more where that came from.

01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:32.005
Are you still here?
Don't you have a bad movie to make?

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:35.800
Listen, I know I let you down and I'm sorry.

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:39.012
But the callow movie star
who came into your life yesterday

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:42.057
is not the same man
who's standing here today.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:48.021
It took the faith of a teenager and the
decency of a good woman to open my eyes.

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:52.984
Believe me, in the last 24 hours,
I've learned a lot about decency, respect,

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:57.906
even...love.

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:02.869
A man's isn't much of anything
unless he can learn from his mistakes

01:08:02.953 --> 01:08:05.080
and make them right. So...

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.208
Look, I'm here to say I'm sorry.

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:11.878
But more importantly, I wanna make it right.

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:15.799
So I'm not asking
you for a second chance, Kelly.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.550
I'm begging you.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:22.514
Now, maybe it doesn't make much sense
because we don't know each other but...

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:23.932
I think I...

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.394
- I think I...
- Move the hand.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:32.689
Sure.

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.487
Well, even if we're over,
at least help me rescue Jeff.

01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:39.072
What, Jeff needs to be rescued?

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:41.032
Yeah, he's going after Guan-Di.
I thought you knew.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:42.617
Oh, my God!

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:44.202
I...

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:52.752
Hey!

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.969
Hey! Wait! Wait!

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:21.738
Okay, maybe this was a bad idea.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.831
Okay, this was definitely a bad idea.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:35.627
Big ass, self-obsessed movie star.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:39.966
- Haven't you ever heard of a telephone?
- Look, I am not self-obsessed.

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.136
Do you really think I have a big ass?

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.598
Do you even know where we're going?

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.018
Jeff's friends were killed outside
an old Chinese graveyard.

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.645
I'm guessing that's where they went.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:58.651
- Move the hand.
- Okay, okay. My God.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.579
Jeff!

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:11.331
Jeff!

01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:13.917
He's not in there.

01:10:14.668 --> 01:10:17.295
Well, if he has any sense,
he's probably hightailing it back to town.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.672
If he had any sense,
he wouldn't have called you.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:20.882
Jeff!

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:29.224
Stand back, Kel.
Mr. Winchester is itching for some action.

01:10:31.852 --> 01:10:34.771
What? What? What am I... Oh.

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:41.694
Hey, you big son-of-a-bitch,
pick on somebody your own size!

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:43.321
Jeff, come on!

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.200
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:50.411
Yeah, I'm okay
in a scared-to-death kind of way.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.876
Okay, here's the deal.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:59.921
I'm gonna stall the one-ton wonton,
which should give you, oh, I don't know,

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:02.382
maybe 30 seconds to find a way to stop him

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:06.636
before he rips my head off and
shoves it in my face, so better get busy.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.554
- Bruce.
- Yes, Kelly?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.557
- Before you go...
- Yes?

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.270
You'll need ammo.

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:18.064
I knew that.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:22.235
Okay, Jeff, you know this stuff
way better than I do.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.279
- How do we stop it?
- Okay. Okay.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:26.447
Hollywood writers
have spent countless hours

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:29.409
writing stories about defeating monsters.

01:11:29.493 --> 01:11:32.036
There's gotta be something
we can use in here.

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:34.747
Hey, stay where I can see you!

01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:40.253
Okay, doofus, here I am!

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:45.425
- How we doing, team?
- Okay. Bruce, I think this might work.

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:48.094
Where's the nearest
oceanic oil-drilling platform?

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.762
Oh, about 1,000 miles away.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.101
Okay.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.814
Do we have any abandoned steel mills
with giant vats of molten metal?

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:01.399
Oh, come on.

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:08.698
Okay, how about
extensive mine shaft systems

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:10.658
with cannibal bats
underneath active volcanoes?

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:12.452
You gotta be shitting me.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.920
"Protected for those who

01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:28.384
"died."

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.974
Be patient.

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.060
Oh!

01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:40.605
You can't bowl for shit.
You should go back to Dayton.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.482
Oh!

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:45.151
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.695
You here for me?

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.118
No, this and this. Thank you.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.000
You tricked me!

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:04.087
An island full of giant, mutated gorillas?

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.339
Oh, wait, no, you died in that one.

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:10.134
Jeff, Hollywood writers spend all day
in dark rooms by themselves.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.178
They have no concept of reality whatsoever.

01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:16.182
So you'd better think of something else
and pretty damn fast.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:19.602
Bruce!

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:25.566
The sign.
He's also the protector of bean curd.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:33.616
I'll be a horse's ass.
Pardon me, big guy.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:42.125
Well, it's nice to know that tofu
really is good for your health.

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:45.253
- There he is.
- WING: Hey, lady!

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:49.382
I'll get you. Give me back my bean curd.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.637
You afraid of Wing, huh?

01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.934
Wing powerful.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.439
More powerful than Guan-Di,
who is Wing's servant

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.066
and must listen to anything Wing say.

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:08.484
Right, Guan-Di?

01:14:09.319 --> 01:14:11.070
Guan-Di!

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.614
Bean curd.

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:27.253
- Hey, that's gives me an idea.
- What?

01:14:27.337 --> 01:14:29.547
Look, I know I'm throwing
a real Hail Mary here,

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.507
but have you got any dynamite
in this truck?

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:32.592
Of course I don't have any dynamite.

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:35.428
- What kind of a freak would have dynamite...
- I do.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:43.352
Bruce, I've got dynamite,
wire and a plunger.

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.440
What? I was going up
against Guan-Di, Mom.

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:50.485
I brought all kinds of shit. I mean, stuff.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.946
Good. You get the dynamite,
meet me at the entrance of the mine shaft.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:56.616
- What, you're gonna use yourself as bait?
- Well, yes and no.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.993
We're gonna get a little help
from my friend here.

01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:00.828
When Guan-Di spots
my ass on his doorstep,

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.580
he's gonna go totally Pearl Harbor.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.665
That's when we drop the mountain
on his demon ass.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:09.086
- It sounds a little risky.
- You're telling me. This is our only standee.

01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:10.296
All right. Now, look,

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:14.175
when hari-kari Larry takes a dirt nap,
we take this sacred amulet,

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:18.262
you know, the entire reason why we're here,
we put it right back where it belongs.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:21.140
That way we can all get back
to our normal, miserable lives.

01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.357
Well, this is it.

01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:33.110
I'll keep him away from the entrance
until you give the signal.

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:38.908
Now, look, no matter which way this goes,
I want you both to know one thing.

01:15:39.826 --> 01:15:42.954
I'll never forgive you
for dragging me out here.

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:53.464
Okay, just you and me, Top Ramen.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:57.176
You're the protector of bean curd.
Get busy.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:02.431
Nice catch.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.855
Hey, grounder.

01:16:10.857 --> 01:16:13.317
That's gonna mean some extra runs!

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.030
Oh, another one!

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.866
Oh, bad hop.

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.535
Almost ready.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.596
- Good to go, Mom.
- We're ready!

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:52.064
Just walking along,
minding my own business.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.066
Oh, look, a mine shaft.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.114
Hey, asshole!

01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:02.533
Go fuck yourself!

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:16.464
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Let him get all the way in.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:29.018
- He's not buying it.
- That's weird, I approved that likeness.

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:30.728
Bruce, what do we do?

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:33.105
Well, looks like we're gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way,

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:36.359
- mano a monster.
- But that's suicide.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:39.236
Only if I die, kid. Wish me luck.

01:17:39.279 --> 01:17:41.614
- Bruce.
- Yes?

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:44.617
For luck.

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:51.957
- You wanna move that hand?
- That's not my hand.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:07.264
- Okay, Jeff, do it. Now!
- Mom, I can't!

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.976
Not the face! Not the face!

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:13.145
It is Bruce Campbell!

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.773
Look, I know how much he means to you,

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:18.859
how much he means
to all the audiences across the world,

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.653
how much he means to me.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:24.115
But look, you've got to just think
of one question right now.

01:18:24.157 --> 01:18:26.701
What would Bruce Campbell do?

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:28.536
- Run away?
- No!

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:05.698
I can't believe he's gone.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.180
Stay there.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.225
Bruce.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.352
Bruce.

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:38.147
Well, I'm glad that's over.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.443
- Jeff, I just have one request.
- Anything, Bruce.

01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:46.071
Next time you unleash an ancient demon,
call that Buffy chick.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.548
Stop! Stop!

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:08.135
What's the problem, Bruce?

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:11.764
Look, I'm sorry,
but these shock endings are a rip off.

01:20:11.848 --> 01:20:15.768
I mean, we just killed the creature
like 30 seconds ago, and now it's back?

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.520
The fans deserve better.

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:22.233
And come on, for once, could we please
have a happy ending to a horror film?

01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:26.570
- Yeah. A happy ending is a great...
- I'll think about it.

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.531
Think about it, though.

01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:39.625
Oh, I never knew life could be so swell.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:43.462
Well, once you've made love
the Bruce Campbell way, you never go back.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:47.299
Father, Mother,
I've just been accepted to Harvard.

01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:50.678
I told you that C average
was nothing to worry about.

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:53.430
Group hug.

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:56.225
You happy?

01:20:56.309 --> 01:20:57.518
- You happy?
- Oh, yes.

01:20:57.602 --> 01:21:00.813
- We're all happy.
- One big happy family.

01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:13.909
Now, I ask you,
what could be a better ending than that?

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.662
Oh, my God!
