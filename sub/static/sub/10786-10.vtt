WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:03.333
TV: AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE
IS PROOF POSITIVE

00:03.333 --> 00:04.417
THAT THE GOOD LORD
DOESN'T TAKE LIGHTLY

00:04.417 --> 00:07.083
TO THOSE WHO DABBLE
IN THE BLACK ARTS.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.708
NICE ENTRANCE.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.500
DAWSON,
ISN'T THERE A LIMIT
ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES

00:26.500 --> 00:27.375
A PERSON CAN WATCH
THEIR OWN MOVIE?

00:27.375 --> 00:29.500
I'VE GOTTA
BE PREPARED.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.625
WE'VE GOT
A Q&A SESSION
AFTER THE SCREENING.

00:30.625 --> 00:31.625
OH, THE SCREENING.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.583
HOW SUNDANCE.

00:33.583 --> 00:34.375
LET'S NOT BLOW THIS
COMPLETELY

00:34.375 --> 00:37.417
OUT OF PROPORTION,
SHALL WE?

00:37.417 --> 00:39.291
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:39.291 --> 00:40.291
NOTHING.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.083
COULD IT BE...

00:44.041 --> 00:45.458
WHAT?

00:45.458 --> 00:47.917
DAWSON LEERY,
THE GIFTED, YOUNG,

00:47.917 --> 00:49.166
SELF-MOTIVATED AUTEUR,

00:49.166 --> 00:52.041
CAPESIDE'S OWN SPIELBERGIAN
WUNDERKIND BE NERVOUS?

00:52.041 --> 00:52.333
YEAH.

00:53.917 --> 00:54.875
YEAH,
OF COURSE I AM.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.125
I MEAN, IT'S,
YOU KNOW...

00:57.125 --> 00:58.417
IT'S ONE THING
TO BE A BIG FISH

00:58.417 --> 01:00.125
IN A SMALL POND,
THAT IS, CAPESIDE--

01:00.125 --> 01:02.583
BUT ENTIRELY ANOTHER
TO SWIM IN THE TALENT POOL

01:02.583 --> 01:04.917
WITH HUNDREDS OF
YOUR EGOCENTRIC COMPETITORS.

01:04.917 --> 01:06.375
EXACTLY.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.750
AND THANK YOU FOR
THAT GUT-WRENCHING
VISUAL.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.708
NOW, I MAY BE
A LITTLE BIASED
HERE BECAUSE...

01:11.708 --> 01:15.500
WELL, LET'S FACE IT,
I AM ONE OF THE STARS
OF YOUR MOVIE,

01:15.500 --> 01:18.000
BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.458
AND LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,

01:19.458 --> 01:21.041
I MEAN,
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,

01:21.041 --> 01:23.708
THIS EXPERIENCE WILL ONLY
TAKE YOU ONE STEP CLOSER

01:23.708 --> 01:25.166
TO REALIZING YOUR DREAMS.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.000
BESIDES, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SPEND AN ENTIRE WEEKEND

01:30.000 --> 01:31.708
WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER.

01:31.708 --> 01:33.542
THAT IS KIND OF
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.917
YEAH, WELL, I SIGNED UP
FOR THE COLLEGE TOUR.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.750
THEY PAIR YOU OFF
WITH ONE OF THE STUDENTS.

01:38.750 --> 01:39.750
SO...THOSE ARE THE RULES.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.917
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

01:41.583 --> 01:43.667
YEAH.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.542
BUT...IN A GOOD WAY.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.583
I MEAN...I KNOW
WE'RE JUST VISITING, BUT...

01:50.583 --> 01:52.583
THIS TRIP
KIND OF GIVES ME HOPE.

01:52.583 --> 01:53.750
THAT MAYBE ONE DAY
I WILL MAKE IT OUTTA HERE.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.708
HEY, JOEY.

01:55.708 --> 01:57.667
IT'S NEVER ONCE
CROSSED MY MIND

01:57.667 --> 01:58.417
THAT YOU WOULDN'T
MAKE IT OUTTA HERE.

02:00.417 --> 02:03.917
IT'S EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY, DAWSON.

02:03.917 --> 02:06.208
COME ON, JOEY,
STICK WITH THE
ORIGINAL IMPULSE.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.625
LOOK AT THIS WEEKEND
AS AN ADVENTURE.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.875
ALL RIGHT? I MEAN,
THIS IS--THIS IS
OUR FIRST FORAY

02:09.875 --> 02:11.125
INTO THE REAL WORLD.

02:11.125 --> 02:13.458
YOU KNOW,
THIS WEEKEND
COULD BE A GLIMPSE

02:13.458 --> 02:14.917
INTO THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.542
OR IT...

02:16.542 --> 02:18.875
IT COULD BE
THE WEEKEND WHEN ALL
OF OUR HOPES AND DREAMS

02:18.875 --> 02:20.333
JUST COME
CRASHING DOWN AROUND US.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.959
I MEAN, FORCING US
TO WITHDRAW FROM
MAINSTREAM SOCIETY

02:22.959 --> 02:24.458
AND SPEND THE REST OF
OUR DAYS AS THESE CYNICAL,

02:24.458 --> 02:27.208
EMBITTERED SHADOWS
OF OUR FORMER SELVES.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.208
IT'S JUST A THOUGHT.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.834
Dawson: I FEEL LIKE
RICHARD DREYFUSS

03:36.834 --> 03:38.125
IN CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
OF THE THIRD KIND,

03:38.125 --> 03:39.542
YOU KNOW, THE DIRECTOR'S CUT
WHERE HE FINALLY

03:39.542 --> 03:42.708
BOARDS THE MOTHER SHIP
AND MINGLES WITH THE ALIENS?

03:42.708 --> 03:43.250
Joey:
NEWS FLASH, DAWSON.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.792
WE ARE THE ALIENS.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.792
Jack: WHAT, UH,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
THERE, SIS?

03:46.792 --> 03:50.917
Andie: THESE STUDENTS
ENJOY THE DISTINCTION
OF ATTENDING

03:50.917 --> 03:53.208
AMERICA'S
FINEST COLLEGE!

03:53.208 --> 03:56.208
FOUNDED IN 1626,
IT WAS NAMED AFTER
A BRITISH COLONIST

03:56.208 --> 03:59.583
WHO ENDED UP DONATING
HIS ENTIRE COLLECTION
OF BOOKS.

03:59.583 --> 04:02.166
THE ORIGINAL FACULTY,
TEACHING IN
THE COLONIAL WILDERNESS,

04:02.166 --> 04:06.166
COULD HARDLY HAVE
IMAGINED THAT OVER
THE NEXT 3 CENTURIES,

04:06.166 --> 04:07.959
IT WOULD BECOME KNOWN
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

04:07.959 --> 04:09.750
AS A PREMIER CENTER
FOR TEACHING
AND RESEARCH!

04:09.750 --> 04:13.250
Dawson:
MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRITE
FOR THE CATALOG, ANDIE.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.750
OH, IT IS
THE CATALOG, DAWSON.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.166
I THINK SHE SENT AWAY

04:34.166 --> 04:36.000

06:42.583 --> 06:44.291
NO. THIS IS NOT
HER  ROOM.

06:44.291 --> 06:47.208
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MY ROOMMATE FOR THE
WEEKEND JUNIOR TOUR.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.041
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE I CAN FIND HER?

06:48.041 --> 06:49.792

07:06.333 --> 07:08.166
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.458
WHAT I SAID WAS
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU CAN FIND HER.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.250

AMBIGUOUS NAMES

07:21.083 --> 07:23.000

A PRECARIOUS
SITUATION.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.000
TO SAY THE LEAST.

07:27.041 --> 07:27.959
BEFORE YOU START

07:27.959 --> 07:30.000
CRYING

07:36.041 --> 07:38.417
HUH. I'M NOT STAYING HERE.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.125
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT
WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR, OK?

07:40.125 --> 07:42.583
I'M SUPPOSED

THE WEEKEND WITH SOMEONE

07:42.583 --> 07:43.458

MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BE VISITING WOMEN'S
COLLEGES INSTEAD.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.375
NO. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.208
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
2 PEOPLE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX

08:18.208 --> 08:20.375
CAN'T SPEND ONE NIGHT
TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.583

THAT'S NOT--
CAREFUL!

08:39.207 --> 08:41.500
CAREFUL.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.458

10:49.458 --> 10:51.458
WELL, DO YOU THINK
SOMETHING MIGHT
OPEN UP?

10:51.458 --> 10:54.708
WOULD YOU CANCEL
YOUR UNIVERSITY INTERVIEW
AT THE LAST MINUTE?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.625
SEE MY POINT?

11:03.583 --> 11:05.417
Girl in film:
HEY, THE BOAT'S HERE!

11:12.500 --> 11:13.625
[BOAT ENGINE STARTING]

11:24.083 --> 11:25.708
MAN. BEEN THERE,
SEEN THAT.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.041
WHERE DO YOU
WANNA GO EAT?

11:29.542 --> 11:31.166
Mr. Pruet:
UH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

11:31.166 --> 11:32.542
IF ANYONE HAS ANY...

11:32.542 --> 11:33.500
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS,

11:33.500 --> 11:35.542
UH, THE FILMMAKER WOULD BE

11:35.542 --> 11:37.917
GLAD TO ANSWER THEM FOR YOU.

11:38.625 --> 11:39.875
M-MR. LEERY?

11:41.166 --> 11:44.542
UH, DAWSON LEERY, CAN YOU
STEP UP HERE, PLEASE?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.792
HI, UM--OOPS. HEH.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.625
SORRY. HEH.

12:08.625 --> 12:11.667
UH...I'M DAWSON LEERY.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.291
UM...

12:15.667 --> 12:17.792
D-D-DOES ANYONE, UH...

12:18.458 --> 12:19.959
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR...

12:23.208 --> 12:23.583
UH, YEAH.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.041
YES.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.750
QUESTION.
WHERE'S THE JOEY
CHICK?

12:27.583 --> 12:29.625
SHE HERE?
SHE IS HOT.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.500
UM...

12:40.583 --> 12:42.083
DAWSON!

12:42.083 --> 12:43.208
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, FINE.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.667
THESE SCREENINGS,
IT CAN GET
PRETTY BRUTAL

12:45.667 --> 12:47.333
WHEN THE LIGHTS
COME UP.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.542
I CAN HANDLE THAT,
I MEAN, IT...

12:49.542 --> 12:51.083
SO WHAT IF MY MOVIE'S
NOT HIP ENOUGH

12:51.083 --> 12:53.417
TO AROUSE THE INTERESTS
OF THESE PSEUDO
INTELLECTUAL

12:53.417 --> 12:54.917
ART HOUSE SNOBS?
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

12:54.917 --> 12:55.875
AT LEAST
NO ONE THREW THINGS.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.417
THANK GOD
FOR SMALL FAVORS.

12:57.417 --> 12:59.417
YOU ARE UPSET.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.583
WOULDN'T YOU BE?

13:00.583 --> 13:02.333
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN THERE.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.750
I REALLY AM. BUT...

13:03.750 --> 13:05.583
IN LIGHT
OF THE BLAIR
WITCH PROJECT,

13:05.583 --> 13:07.417
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WERE THINKING.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.625
WHAT?

13:08.625 --> 13:10.333
RIDING THE COATTAILS
OF SOME ABSURDLY

13:10.333 --> 13:11.959
SUCCESSFUL CULTURAL
PHENOMENON IS SIMPLY
NOT GONNA CUT IT.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.875
BEFORE YOU EVISCERATE
MY WORK ANY FURTHER,

13:14.875 --> 13:16.458
WHY DON'T YOU AT LEAST
TELL ME YOUR NAME?

13:16.458 --> 13:17.417
NIKKI.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.000
NIKKI GREEN.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.792
NICE TO MEET YOU, NIKKI.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.792
TAKE THIS
JOEY CHARACTER,
FOR EXAMPLE, I MEAN,

13:23.792 --> 13:25.792
WHO IS SHE
AND WHAT DOES SHE
MEAN TO YOU?

13:25.792 --> 13:28.667
ARE--ARE YOU FRIENDS, LOVERS,
WHAT? NOTHING WAS CLEAR.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.250
MORE TROUBLING IS
THAT YOU DIDN'T SEEM

13:30.250 --> 13:31.208
TO UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT WAS THE MOST

13:31.208 --> 13:33.291
INTERESTING PART
OF YOUR STORY.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.667
WELL,
AREN'T YOU PERCEPTIVE.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.125
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.667
I'M TRYING TO
GIVE YOU AN HONEST
ASSESSMENT HERE.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.208
WELL, EXCUSE ME,
BUT IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

13:40.208 --> 13:41.792
THAT I'M SUBJECTED
TO AN UNSOLICITED

13:41.792 --> 13:43.792
NOTE SESSION FROM A--
VOLUNTEER?

13:43.792 --> 13:44.959
PAPER PUSHER?

13:44.959 --> 13:45.792
MY POSITION
AND ALTRUISM

13:45.792 --> 13:48.458
INVALIDATE
MY OPINION.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.500
WELL, NEXT TIME
I'LL PICK

13:49.500 --> 13:51.000
WHICH WOUNDS TO LICK
MORE CAREFULLY.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.417
Driver: WELL?

14:14.417 --> 14:15.583
YOU IN OR OUT?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.458
DAWSON.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.583
HEY.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.834
HEY.

14:46.834 --> 14:47.959
HOW'D
THE SCREENING GO?

14:48.875 --> 14:50.417
HUH.

14:50.417 --> 14:54.083
COME ON, IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN THAT BAD,
COULD IT?

14:54.083 --> 14:56.959
IT WAS
AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.750
WHAT DO THOSE
HIPPER-THAN-THOU

15:00.750 --> 15:01.834
FILM BRATS KNOW,
ANYWAY?

15:02.625 --> 15:03.959
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.

15:05.708 --> 15:06.959
COME ON.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.000
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.708
NO, I--I'VE BEEN
THINKING THAT...

15:11.708 --> 15:13.250
YOU KNOW...

15:13.250 --> 15:15.792
MAYBE THE PROBLEM
WITH HAVING SUCH
A BIG DREAM IS...

15:15.792 --> 15:17.000
YOU NEVER STOP
TO QUESTION WHETHER
YOU ACTUALLY

15:17.000 --> 15:18.708
HAVE THE TALENT
TO BACK IT UP.

15:18.708 --> 15:22.834
WHAT IF I--I JUST
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

15:22.834 --> 15:24.333
TO BE
A GREAT FILMMAKER?

15:24.834 --> 15:27.458
DAWSON...

15:27.458 --> 15:29.917
I'VE BEEN THERE
FROM THE BEGINNING.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.458
TO MOST PEOPLE,
MOVIES ARE JUST
A WAY OF PASSING TIME,

15:32.458 --> 15:35.375
BUT I WAS THERE THAT DAY
THAT THEY BECAME SOMETHING MORE
TO YOU,

15:35.375 --> 15:37.834
THE DAY
YOU DECIDED TO PICK UP
YOUR PARENTS' CAMCORDER

15:37.834 --> 15:40.750
AND MAKE A MOVIE
OF YOUR OWN.

15:40.750 --> 15:41.917
THE DAY THAT YOU SAID
FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT LOUD

15:41.917 --> 15:44.500
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO BE A FILMMAKER.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.875
I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF WATCHING YOU
TAKE THIS DREAM

15:47.875 --> 15:48.875
AND MAKE IT A REALITY.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.250
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.000
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

16:12.959 --> 16:14.083
YOU!

16:14.083 --> 16:16.125
MM-HMM.
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

16:16.125 --> 16:17.375
THE JANITOR.

16:17.375 --> 16:20.625
DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.291
BUT I BROUGHT YOU DESSERT.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.792
AND I THOUGHT
I'D SEEN IT ALL.

16:25.792 --> 16:26.959
WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D BE HERE,

16:26.959 --> 16:29.250
YOU KNOW,
ON THE OFF CHANCE

16:29.250 --> 16:31.625
THAT DEAN HARGROVE GOT BACK
EARLY. THEN I COULD, YOU KNOW.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.792
YOU'VE GOT CHUTZPAH,
I'LL SAY THAT MUCH
FOR YOU.

16:34.792 --> 16:35.750
SO...

16:35.750 --> 16:37.000
IS HE BACK YET?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
HE'S A NOTORIOUSLY
LATE LUNCHER.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.959
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.375
NOTHING.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.000
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY KIDS
I HAVE?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.083
7.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.625
YOU KNOW
HOW MANY WENT
TO THIS UNIVERSITY?

16:52.625 --> 16:54.625
ZERO.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.917
IT DIDN'T SEEM
TO BOTHER THEM MUCH.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.458
SO YOU DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA GET IN.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.000
OH, I GAVE UP
A LONG TIME AGO

17:00.000 --> 17:03.041
TRYIN' TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THEY'RE GONNA
ACCEPT.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.875
SO YOU HAD 7 KIDS.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.290
2 ARE DOCTORS...
UM...

17:08.290 --> 17:11.541
ONE'S AN
INVESTMENT BANKER,
WHATEVER THAT IS.

17:11.541 --> 17:12.750
THE 3 GIRLS
ARE MARRIED,

17:12.750 --> 17:14.083
AND ONE DIDN'T
GO TO COLLEGE.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.125
PLAYS HORN IN A JAZZ
BAND DOWNTOWN.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.125
WHICH DO YOU THINK
IS HAPPIEST?

17:21.625 --> 17:24.040
OK. SO WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME IS

17:24.040 --> 17:26.333
AVOID MEDICAL SCHOOL
AND WALL STREET,

17:26.333 --> 17:27.541
DON'T GET MARRIED,

17:27.541 --> 17:30.041
AND SKIP COLLEGE.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.166
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU ATTEND

17:31.166 --> 17:34.542
THIS DISTINGUISHED
UNIVERSITY

17:34.542 --> 17:36.083
WILL HAVE LITTLE
OR NOTHING TO DO

17:36.083 --> 17:39.375
WITH WHAT
KIND OF PERSON
YOU TURN OUT TO BE.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.041
OR WHETHER
YOU FIND FULFILLMENT
IN YOUR LIFE.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.375
HMM.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.125
FRESHMAN ENGLISH,
HUH?

18:01.125 --> 18:04.417
YOU PICKED
A GOOD ONE TO VISIT.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.083
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE IN THIS CLASS.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.166
KINDA.

18:10.750 --> 18:11.834
WANNA SIT?

18:11.834 --> 18:14.166
UH, NO. I CAN'T.

18:14.917 --> 18:15.959
SO I, UH...

18:15.959 --> 18:17.834
I GUESS THIS PROFESSOR'S
REALLY LATE.

18:17.834 --> 18:19.583
NO, HE'S NOT COMING.

18:19.583 --> 18:20.583
THEY DO THAT A LOT.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.583
THEN
SOME POOR SCHMUCK

18:21.583 --> 18:23.166
UNDERGRADUATE
TEACHING ASSISTANT

18:23.166 --> 18:24.875
HAS TO COME IN
AND TRY TO
RALLY THE TROOPS

18:24.875 --> 18:26.750
FOR WHAT'S KNOWN AS
DISCUSSION SESSION!

18:26.750 --> 18:28.750
HI, GUYS!

18:28.750 --> 18:33.000
PROFESSOR TAYLOR'S
AT A SEMIOTICS
CONFERENCE IN SEATTLE,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.041
SO YOU'RE STUCK
WITH ME

18:35.041 --> 18:36.750
AGAIN.

18:36.750 --> 18:40.125
NOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF
VISITING HIGH SCHOOLERS
IN OUR MIDST TODAY,

18:40.125 --> 18:44.083
SO I THOUGHT WE'D TAKE
A BREAK FROM OUR ONGOING
GREAT BOOKS DISCUSSION,

18:44.083 --> 18:47.667
AND ASK SOME OF THEM
WHAT BOOKS
THEY CONSIDER GREAT.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.792
HOW ABOUT YOU?

18:50.792 --> 18:53.208
IN THE CHEAP SEATS.
BROWN-HAIRED GIRL.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.667
WHAT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.959
YOU READ, DON'T YOU?

19:03.458 --> 19:04.458
LITTLE WOMEN.

19:04.458 --> 19:07.875
LOUISA MAY ALCOTT.
INTERESTING.

19:07.875 --> 19:08.750
YOU KNOW,
I HAVEN'T READ THAT

19:08.750 --> 19:12.458
SINCE I WAS...
10 OR SO.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.000
AS FAR
AS I REMEMBER,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.333
IT'S SORT OF A LESS
SUCCESSFUL VERSION
OF JANE EYRE.

19:16.333 --> 19:20.208
SOMETHING
ABOUT A GIRL
WITH A BOY'S NAME?

19:21.792 --> 19:23.458
THE GIRL'S NAME IS JO.

19:23.458 --> 19:27.000
SHE HAS 3 SISTERS,
A MOTHER, A FATHER
WHO'S USUALLY NOT AROUND,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.917
AND WHEN HE IS,
HE'S VERY IMPRACTICAL

19:28.917 --> 19:31.875
AND HE'S NOT
THE GREATEST AT PROVIDING
THE MATERIAL THINGS IN LIFE.

19:31.875 --> 19:34.125
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:34.125 --> 19:35.875
THEY'RE POOR, BUT
THEY HAVE EACH OTHER.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.125
AND THERE'S
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH A BOY NEXT DOOR.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.750
YEAH, IT'S ALL
COMING BACK TO ME.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.542
OK, SO LITTLE WOMEN.

19:41.542 --> 19:44.583
PERENNIAL AMERICAN
CLASSIC, YES.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.166
BUT GREAT BOOK?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.291
WORTHY OF INCLUSION
IN THE LITERARY
CANON?

19:47.291 --> 19:50.792
WHAT DO WE THINK,
PEOPLE?

19:50.792 --> 19:54.041
NO WAY. THIS BOOK IS
COMPLETELY ANTI-FEMINIST
IN SPIRIT.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.834
I CONCUR.

19:55.834 --> 20:00.000
I MEAN, THE HEROINE
SUPPOSEDLY BURNS WITH
THIS ARTISTIC GENIUS,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.417
BUT ULTIMATELY SHE GIVES UP
ALL OF HER DREAMS,

20:02.417 --> 20:04.500
GETS MARRIED, AND
STARTS POPPING OUT BABIES.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
Man:
ALCOTT'S A MINOR WRITER.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.542
MOST OF WHAT SHE WROTE,
SHE WROTE PURELY
FOR MONEY.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.542
AND WHAT'S THE LESSON HERE?

20:11.542 --> 20:13.250
THAT WE CAN'T SAY
A BOOK IS GREAT

20:13.250 --> 20:16.834
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE IDENTIFY
WITH THE HERO OR HEROINE.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.375
JOEY, WAIT.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.792
WHY, SO YOU CAN SIC
ONE OF YOUR LITTLE
OVEREDUCATED MINIONS ON ME?

20:24.792 --> 20:26.959
TRY AGAIN.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.959
ADMITTEDLY WE WERE
A LITTLE HARSH.

20:28.959 --> 20:30.250
I CONCUR.

20:30.250 --> 20:33.000
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.458
DON'T BE SO GLIB.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.875
WHAT YOU DID IN THERE
WAS INSENSITIVE.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.250
YOU HARDLY KNOW ME, A.J.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.875
MAYBE I AM JUST SOME NAIVE
LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL GIRL,

20:40.875 --> 20:43.375
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING A TASTE

20:43.375 --> 20:44.208
OF THE FUN PART
OF THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE,

20:44.208 --> 20:48.041
NOT JUST THAT MEAN,
BITTER PART.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.959
DO YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME
STARING AT THAT iBOOK

20:49.959 --> 20:52.500
THAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
THAT PART EVEN EXISTED?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.959
I'M SORRY.

20:55.542 --> 20:57.166
HOW ABOUT
WE START OVER?

20:57.166 --> 20:58.208
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO SHOW YOU

20:58.208 --> 20:59.750
WHAT COLLEGE IS
REALLY ALL ABOUT.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.333
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

21:08.250 --> 21:09.625
WHOA.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.959
SHH.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.917
YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHO SHOT THIS?

21:15.917 --> 21:18.458
Man: Shh. Quiet!

21:18.458 --> 21:20.917
IT'S ON ANOTHER LEVEL
IS WHAT I THINK.

21:20.917 --> 21:21.834
Man: HEY, MAN, KEEP IT DOWN.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.458
Shh.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.667
LET'S GET THIS GIFTED
YOUNG FILMMAKER UP HERE,
SHALL WE?

21:44.291 --> 21:47.291
[CHEERING]

21:55.625 --> 21:57.375
[BANG]

21:59.291 --> 21:59.917
[BANG]

21:59.917 --> 22:02.083
DAWSON.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.792
HEY.

22:03.792 --> 22:07.250
I NEED A SUGAR FIX AFTER
ALL STRESSFUL EXPERIENCES.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.375
[GASPS] FINALLY.

22:11.041 --> 22:14.542
STRESSFUL? COME ON,
THAT WAS A LOVE FEST.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.959
DON'T SOUND SO OVERJOYED.

22:16.959 --> 22:18.500
DON'T BE
FALSELY MODEST.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.917
IF IT HAD BEEN
THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

22:20.917 --> 22:23.208
I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED
YOUR SUCCESS.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.667
SO YOU'RE NOT ONLY
A BETTER FILMMAKER
THAN I AM,

22:25.667 --> 22:27.417
YOU'RE
A BETTER PERSON.

22:29.208 --> 22:32.542
LOOK. CAN WE
START OVER AGAIN?

22:34.291 --> 22:36.041
YEAH. LET'S.

22:36.959 --> 22:40.500
SO, WHAT DID YOU
THINK OF MY FILM?

22:40.500 --> 22:44.125
REALLY.
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
ONLY, PLEASE.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.625
I, UH, I THOUGHT
YOUR FILM

22:46.625 --> 22:49.583
WAS TECHNICALLY
ACCOMPLISHED.

22:49.583 --> 22:50.875
"TECHNICALLY
ACCOMPLISHED."

22:50.875 --> 22:54.375
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A NICE DISMOUNT
OFF THE BALANCE BEAM.

22:54.375 --> 22:57.708
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN DERIVATIVE...

22:57.708 --> 23:00.667
OR UNCLEAR OR
NOT UNDERSTANDING
YOUR OWN MATERIAL.

23:00.667 --> 23:07.333
OK, MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE
INSENSITIVE IN MY COMMENTS.

23:07.917 --> 23:08.458
I'M SORRY.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.750
DULY NOTED.

23:10.750 --> 23:14.333
NOW, YOU NEVER
MENTIONED BEFORE

23:14.333 --> 23:16.208
THAT YOU WERE
ENTERED IN THIS
FILM FESTIVAL.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.333
WHY NOT?

23:18.542 --> 23:20.500
I DON'T LEAD
WITH MY CHIN, DAWSON.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.708
YOU CAN GET HURT
THAT WAY.

23:24.291 --> 23:25.458
YEAH, YOU CAN.

23:26.834 --> 23:30.041
WELL, UM,
YOU SEEMED TO REALLY
KNOCK THEM DEAD.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.500
CONGRATULATIONS.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.291
I THINK I'M GONNA
WRITE ABOUT HER.

23:40.291 --> 23:42.375
FOR YOUR
APPLICATION ESSAY?

23:42.375 --> 23:46.834
WHO WAS THE ONE PERSON
WHO INFLUENCED YOU
THE MOST AND WHY?

23:46.834 --> 23:48.917
YOU SHOULD.

23:48.917 --> 23:52.500
MIGHT HELP YOU
ORGANIZE YOUR THOUGHTS
ABOUT HER.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.333
I REMEMBER ONE DAY,

23:57.333 --> 23:59.542
IT WAS
ABOUT 6 MONTHS
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

23:59.542 --> 24:02.875
I FOUND HER
BY THE CREEK.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.750
SHE WAS JUST SITTING
IN THE WATER,

24:06.750 --> 24:11.458
HER BLOUSE
WAS SOAKING WET, AND...

24:11.458 --> 24:17.208
HER HAIR WAS
PLASTERED IN STRANDS
ACROSS HER FACE.

24:17.208 --> 24:20.083
IT'S LIKE SHE DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE TO GO
OR WHAT TO DO.

24:22.125 --> 24:25.208
I DON'T THINK I'LL
FORGET THAT IMAGE
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

24:25.208 --> 24:29.208
DO YOU MIND IF I LAY
A DOSE OF TRUTH ON YOU?

24:29.208 --> 24:33.125
SURE. AFTER I SPILLED MY
DEEPEST, DARKEST SECRETS,
WHY NOT?

24:34.333 --> 24:36.875
ONE--ALWAYS WEAR
SENSIBLE SHOES.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.291
IF YOUR FEET
ARE KILLING YOU,
YOU CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.208
[LAUGHS]
OK, AND 2?

24:43.208 --> 24:47.417
LET YOURSELF OFF THE HOOK
FOR THINGS OVER WHICH
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL.

24:47.417 --> 24:49.959
JUST BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER
COULDN'T GET PAST
YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH

24:49.959 --> 24:53.083
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO BEAT YOURSELF UP

24:53.083 --> 24:54.417
FOR MAKING PEACE WITH IT.

24:56.542 --> 24:57.708
I'M SORRY, I SHOULDN'T BE
STICKING MY BIG NOSE IN.

24:57.708 --> 24:59.792
NO, NO, I WAS JUST
THINKING SOMETHING.

24:59.792 --> 25:04.834
MAYBE WHEN YOUR MOM
STARTS TO LOSE HER MIND,

25:04.834 --> 25:06.458
YOU SORT OF DO, TOO,
YOU KNOW,

25:06.458 --> 25:09.417
AS A WAY OF TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
SHE'S GOING THROUGH.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.208
THIS IS SO WEIRD.
I MEAN, INCREDIBLE,
EVEN,

25:14.208 --> 25:17.667
THAT I AM SITTING HERE
IN CAMBRIDGE WITH--

25:17.667 --> 25:20.959
A 60-YEAR-OLD
CAREER SECRETARY.

25:22.291 --> 25:25.000
WELL, ONE THING I LEARNED
A LONG TIME AGO--

25:25.000 --> 25:29.250
LIFE CAN SURPRISE YOU IN
A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS.

25:32.250 --> 25:33.667
YOU KNOW, AS MUCH
AS I APPRECIATE

25:33.667 --> 25:35.708
YOUR WILLINGNESS
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME,

25:35.708 --> 25:37.333
I GOTTA ASK,
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

25:37.333 --> 25:39.750
YOU'LL SEE.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.667
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

25:53.667 --> 25:56.667
RARE BOOK AND
MANUSCRIPT LIBRARY.

25:56.667 --> 26:00.333
WELL, ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HERE?

26:00.333 --> 26:01.667
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU AFRAID
THE LIBRARY POLICE

26:01.667 --> 26:05.291
ARE GONNA
COME SNATCH US UP?

26:05.291 --> 26:07.125
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING HERE.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.625
WHAT?

26:10.875 --> 26:12.625
HAVE A SEAT.

26:18.542 --> 26:19.708
THIS.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.625
LITTLE WOMEN?

26:23.542 --> 26:25.542
NOT QUITE.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.291
THE BOOK
WE KNOW TODAY
AS LITTLE WOMEN

26:27.291 --> 26:30.083
WAS ORIGINALLY
PUBLISHED IN 2
SEPARATE VOLUMES.

26:30.083 --> 26:31.458
THIS IS JUST
THE FIRST.

26:32.875 --> 26:36.792
IT'S LOUISA MAY
ALCOTT'S
VERY OWN COPY.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.417
GO AHEAD, OPEN IT.
CAREFULLY.

26:39.417 --> 26:43.000
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS
FAVORITE BOOK OF
YOURS HAS TO OFFER.

26:53.250 --> 26:54.834
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE JO AND MEG

26:54.834 --> 26:56.667
GO TO MRS. GARDINER'S
PARTY.

26:59.417 --> 27:02.000
"JO SAW A BIG RED-HEADED
YOUTH APPROACHING HER CORNER,

27:02.000 --> 27:02.959
"AND FEARING
HE MEANT TO ENGAGE HER,

27:02.959 --> 27:06.125
"SHE SLIPPED INTO
A CURTAINED RECESS.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.291
SHE FOUND HERSELF
FACE-TO-FACE WITH
THE LAURENCE BOY."

27:09.291 --> 27:11.708
"DON'T MIND ME.
STAY, IF YOU LIKE."

27:15.000 --> 27:17.041
"SHAN'T I DISTURB YOU?"

27:17.041 --> 27:19.458
"NOT A BIT.
I ONLY CAME HERE

27:19.458 --> 27:21.125
"BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW MANY PEOPLE

27:21.125 --> 27:23.375
AND FELT RATHER
STRANGE AT FIRST,
YOU KNOW."

27:24.458 --> 27:25.959
"SO DID I.

27:25.959 --> 27:30.125
DON'T GO AWAY, PLEASE,
UN-UNLESS YOU'D RATHER."

27:30.125 --> 27:33.750
"THE BOY SAT DOWN AGAIN
AND LOOKED AT HIS BOOTS.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.708
HOW'S YOUR CAT,
MISS MARCH?"

27:38.250 --> 27:39.750
"NICELY, THANK YOU,
MR. LAURENCE,

27:39.750 --> 27:43.625
BUT I AIN'T MISS MARCH.
I'M ONLY JO."

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
MY MOM USED
TO READ THIS TO ME.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.583
THAT'S WHY SHE
NAMED ME JOSEPHINE.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.375
IT WAS HER FAVORITE BOOK.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.583
WAS?

28:05.375 --> 28:07.750
SHE PASSED AWAY.

28:10.583 --> 28:12.000
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

28:14.959 --> 28:18.583
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I READ IT

28:18.583 --> 28:20.208
AND REREAD IT.

28:22.291 --> 28:23.750
'CAUSE WHEN I DO IT'S...

28:24.750 --> 28:26.834
IT'S LIKE SHE'S WITH ME.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.917
SO IT'S LIKE
A FRIEND, THE BOOK.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.542
YEAH.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.792
EXACTLY.

28:40.792 --> 28:42.542
WELL,
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MANY FRIENDS,

28:42.542 --> 28:44.625
POTTER COMMA JOSEPH.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.667
SO, MISS A.J. MOLLER,

28:51.667 --> 28:55.208
WHAT IS
YOUR FAVORITE BOOK?

28:55.208 --> 28:57.917
SOME PONDEROUS TOME
BY HERODOTUS?

28:57.917 --> 28:59.792
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

29:01.333 --> 29:03.500
THE LION, THE WITCH
AND THE WARDROBE.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.333
WELL THAT SOUNDS
RATHER INFANTILE.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.959
ENTIRELY.

29:09.959 --> 29:12.750
BUT LIKE ALL
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE,

29:13.458 --> 29:16.667
SIMPLE, SWEET, MAGICAL.

29:20.667 --> 29:23.375
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

29:52.834 --> 29:55.250
HOW YOU DOING?
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

29:55.250 --> 29:56.792
GOOD. UH--UH, UM,
I GUESS A, UH--

29:56.792 --> 29:58.625
MY GUESS IS
HE CAN'T HANDLE MUCH
MORE THAN A BEER.

29:58.625 --> 30:01.875
MAKE THAT 2, PLEASE.

30:01.875 --> 30:02.792
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT. I-I'M--

30:02.792 --> 30:05.417
IT'S OK.
I WANTED TO.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.500
OK, THANKS.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.667
YOU'RE ADORABLE.

30:15.458 --> 30:18.792
YOU'RE SHY, RIGHT?
LET'S JUST START
ALL OVER, OK?

30:18.792 --> 30:23.000
YOU'RE NOT ADORABLE
AND I AM NOT
ATTRACTED TO YOU.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.834
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

30:28.834 --> 30:31.125
I MEAN,
THIS REALLY PROBABLY
ISN'T YOUR SCENE,

30:31.125 --> 30:33.041
AND WE COULD
JUST TALK, OK?

30:33.041 --> 30:36.125
MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE BETTER

30:36.125 --> 30:37.375
AND THEN WE--

30:38.166 --> 30:40.583
OUR SECOND PLACE
FINALIST,

30:41.583 --> 30:44.250
WINDSCAPE.
DAVID STEINER.

30:50.667 --> 30:53.667
AND NOW, IN FIRST PLACE,

30:53.667 --> 30:55.750
THE AWARD GOES TO...

30:56.875 --> 31:00.125
TOMMY AND MO.
CARL MICHAEL DIGGINS.

31:06.583 --> 31:08.708
VERY NICE, VERY NICE.

31:19.458 --> 31:20.959
NIKKI.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.667
WHAT NOW?

31:24.667 --> 31:25.750
TIME TO RUB SALT
IN THE WOUND?

31:25.750 --> 31:27.542
YOU WERE ROBBED.

31:27.542 --> 31:28.959
EXCUSE ME?

31:28.959 --> 31:30.750
I SAW EVERY
SINGLE FILM
AT THE FESTIVAL.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.041
YOURS WAS THE BEST,
HANDS DOWN.

31:32.041 --> 31:34.667
LET'S DISPENSE WITH
THE MOCK COMPASSION,
SHALL WE?

31:34.667 --> 31:37.208
NOTHING MOCK
ABOUT IT, NIKKI.
IT'S A SIMPLE FACT.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.083
IF IT'S OK
WITH YOU, I'D LIKE
TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

31:39.083 --> 31:42.375
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO UPSET ABOUT THIS?

31:42.375 --> 31:44.083
LIKE YOUR FAILURE
DIDN'T AFFECT YOU?

31:44.083 --> 31:45.542
IT DID, BUT THERE'S
A DIFFERENCE

31:45.542 --> 31:47.875
BETWEEN WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME AND
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.375
AND WHAT'S THAT?

31:49.375 --> 31:51.000
WELL, I LEARNED THAT
I HAVE TO DIG DEEPER

31:51.000 --> 31:52.542
AND REVEAL MORE
OF MYSELF IN MY WORK

31:52.542 --> 31:54.667
IF I'M GONNA MAKE A FILM
THAT'S WORTH ANYTHING.

31:54.667 --> 31:56.083
YOU LEARNED
THAT FILM FESTIVALS

31:56.083 --> 31:57.000
DON'T NECESSARILY
REWARD THE MERITORIOUS.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.000
I WANTED TO WIN, DAWSON.

32:02.417 --> 32:04.000
NIKKI.

32:05.458 --> 32:08.667
YOUR FILM WASN'T
JUST TECHNICALLY
BRILLIANT, OK?

32:08.667 --> 32:10.333
IT WAS INSPIRED.

32:10.917 --> 32:12.500
IT INSPIRED ME.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.667
IT MADE ME REMEMBER
WHY I GOT INTO FILM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.125
NOT TO WIN
FESTIVALS,
NOT FOR GLORY,

32:18.125 --> 32:20.041
BUT TO REACH PEOPLE.

32:22.917 --> 32:25.500
AND YOU DID.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.959
YOU MADE THEM LAUGH,
YOU MOVED THEM.

32:30.458 --> 32:31.917
NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,

32:31.917 --> 32:34.708
I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE UP UNTIL
I REACH THAT GOAL.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.583
YOU REALLY LIKED MY MOVIE?

32:37.583 --> 32:39.250
YEAH.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.500
I REALLY LIKED
YOUR MOVIE.

32:50.041 --> 32:50.917
Dawson: ARE WE
THE FIRST ONES HERE?

32:50.917 --> 32:53.125
Andie: YEAH,
LOOKS LIKE IT.

32:53.125 --> 32:56.208
SO DID YOU GET
YOUR INTERVIEW?

32:56.208 --> 32:57.667
YEAH, I DID.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.458
NOT THE ONE I EXPECTED,
BUT MAYBE THE ONE
I NEEDED.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.417
PRAY TELL.

33:02.417 --> 33:04.458
OH, LONG STORY
SHORT,

33:04.458 --> 33:06.250
I HAD THIS
CHANCE ENCOUNTER

33:06.250 --> 33:07.792
THAT YIELDED
A LITTLE CLARITY.

33:07.792 --> 33:09.166
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID YOU GET WHAT
YOU CAME HERE FOR?

33:09.166 --> 33:13.458
YEAH, I DID, ALSO
IN A MOST UNEXPECTED WAY.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.125
HMM. I THINK THAT'S
WHAT SCREWS US UP
THE MOST.

33:16.125 --> 33:18.667
WHAT?
IT'S LIKE YOU GET THIS PICTURE

33:18.667 --> 33:20.041
IN YOUR HEAD
OF THE WAY THINGS SHOULD BE,

33:20.041 --> 33:22.834
AND YOU END UP
CLOSING YOURSELF OFF

33:22.834 --> 33:23.834
TO SOME
OF THE WONDER
AND SERENDIPITY

33:23.834 --> 33:26.250
OF THE ACTUAL
EXPERIENCE.

33:26.250 --> 33:29.542
WHO WAS THIS CHANCE
ENCOUNTER WITH,
DEEPAK CHOPRA?

33:29.542 --> 33:32.333
YEAH, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.750
ARE THESE TAKEN?

33:39.959 --> 33:42.083
UH, YEAH. KIND OF
SAVING THEM
FOR SOME FRIENDS.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.458
NO PROBLEM. SAY NO MORE.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.667
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM, IT'S COOL.

33:51.667 --> 33:54.000
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THEY'RE COMING.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.500
YOU SURE?

33:55.500 --> 33:56.583
YEAH, YEAH,
POSITIVE.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.417
DO ME A FAVOR.
WAKE ME UP WHEN WE
GET TO CAPESIDE?

34:08.500 --> 34:08.875
YOU'RE GOING TO CAPESIDE?

34:08.875 --> 34:11.000
YEP.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.667
ME, TOO.

34:18.208 --> 34:22.250
HEY, PORTER, IS
THAT DECAF OR CAF?

34:22.250 --> 34:23.833
NIKKI, HEY.

34:23.833 --> 34:25.250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:25.250 --> 34:27.458
I'M DOING
THE DIVORCED KID
SHUFFLE.

34:27.458 --> 34:29.417
MOM'S A TECHIE,
SHE'S BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO CHICAGO.

34:29.417 --> 34:33.542
SO I'M GOING
TO CO-HABITATE
WITH MY DAD.

34:33.542 --> 34:37.333
I KNOW THE DRILL.
MY PARENTS
JUST GOT DIVORCED.

34:37.333 --> 34:37.792
SUCKS, DOESN'T IT?

34:37.792 --> 34:39.125
MM-HMM.

34:39.125 --> 34:42.333
I MEAN, I GUESS,
YOU KNOW,

34:42.333 --> 34:43.583
IT'S FOR THE BEST
AND EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.083
IT WAS A REALLY
LONG, DRAWN-OUT
BATTLE.

34:46.083 --> 34:50.083
IF IT'S FOR THE BEST,
THEN WHY DO I STILL
FEEL SO LOUSY?

34:50.083 --> 34:51.083
YEAH.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.208
YEAH.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.875
SO, UM, WHERE DOES
YOUR FATHER LIVE?

34:54.875 --> 34:56.917
UM, A PLACE
CALLED CAPESIDE.

34:56.917 --> 34:58.792
YOU'RE KIDDING.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.417
NO, HE'S, UH,
THE HIGH SCHOOL
PRINCIPAL THERE.

35:00.417 --> 35:05.250
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOUR FATHER IS
PRINCIPAL GREEN?

35:05.250 --> 35:07.291
DO NOT TELL ME THAT
YOU GO TO SCHOOL THERE.

35:09.417 --> 35:10.375
THIS IS TOO WEIRD.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.583
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

35:11.583 --> 35:12.708
[BOTH LAUGH]

35:15.834 --> 35:18.333
WOW, UM--
SO, MR. JORDAN IS
THE FILM TEACHER,

35:18.333 --> 35:20.417
AND HIS FILM LAB
IS ACTUALLY
REALLY FULL.

35:20.417 --> 35:22.333
I HAD TO BEG,
BORROW, AND STEAL
TO GET IN,

35:22.333 --> 35:24.417
BUT YOU KNOW
I THINK I HAVE
SOME PULL WITH HIM.

35:24.417 --> 35:25.500
I'M ALREADY IN.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.417
WHAT?

35:27.417 --> 35:29.125
WE'VE BEEN E-MAILING
EACH OTHER.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.625
HE'S BEEN GIVING ME
THIS SORT OF PRIVATE TUTORIAL.

35:31.625 --> 35:34.625
OK.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.625
I WASN'T
AWARE THAT HE DID
THAT SORT OF THING.

35:37.625 --> 35:41.417
YOU CAN HANDLE
A LITTLE FRIENDLY
COMPETITION, CAN'T YOU?

35:45.708 --> 35:47.333
BINGHAM, BREELY,
AND BUCKINGHAM?

35:47.333 --> 35:48.458
IT'S A PREP SCHOOL.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.750
SOUNDS MORE
LIKE A LAW FIRM.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.208
SOMETIMES IT
FEELS LIKE ONE.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.166
BUT IN THE MAIN,
I'M JUST HAPPY

35:54.166 --> 35:55.917
TO BE OUT OF
CLAUSTROPHOBIC
CAPESIDE.

35:57.625 --> 35:58.834
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.291
HEARTBREAK.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.792
I NEED A LITTLE
PARENTAL TLC--

36:03.792 --> 36:06.792
SOME CHICKEN SOUP
AND THE COMFORT OF
MY CHILDHOOD BED.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.500
LONG RELATIONSHIP?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.708
2 YEARS.

36:10.708 --> 36:12.667
FEELS LIKE
A DIVORCE, I SWEAR.

36:12.667 --> 36:16.291
NOT TO MENTION THAT
I SEE HIM EVERY DAY
AT SCHOOL.

36:16.291 --> 36:20.125
IT'S LIKE WE'RE
BROKEN UP BUT STILL
LIVING TOGETHER.

36:21.375 --> 36:24.500
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
I GET UNDER THE GAYDAR?

36:24.500 --> 36:26.667
THAT'S WHAT
EVERYONE SAYS.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.500
I'M THE STRAIGHTEST
GAY GUY THEY KNOW.

36:31.083 --> 36:32.250
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

36:32.250 --> 36:34.333
WHAT ABOUT ME?

36:34.333 --> 36:37.333
CAN PEOPLE TELL
RIGHT AWAY?

36:41.834 --> 36:43.959
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

36:43.959 --> 36:45.792
I MEAN,
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

36:45.792 --> 36:48.125
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

36:48.125 --> 36:52.166
I MEAN, NOT IN
A RAGING QUEEN WAY,
BUT MORE IN A...

36:52.166 --> 36:54.708
MORE IN A WHAT WAY?

36:54.708 --> 36:58.166
A BABE IN THE WOODS
NEWBIE WAY.

36:58.166 --> 37:00.208
NEWBIE?

37:02.375 --> 37:05.417
ANY SWEET,
INEXPERIENCED,
YOUNG GAY MAN

37:05.417 --> 37:08.500
DESTINED FOR
A BROKEN HEART.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.542
MAKE IT SOUND SO INVITING.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.166
WELL, LET'S FACE IT,
MOST GUYS
ARE CLUELESS.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.417
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

37:15.959 --> 37:17.959
YOU'LL SEE.

37:20.792 --> 37:22.375
HEY, WHAT'S
YOUR NAME ANYWAY?

37:22.375 --> 37:26.375
[CLEARS THROAT]
JACK. JACK McPHEE.

37:26.375 --> 37:29.208
ETHAN. IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.333
I HOPE I DIDN'T
KEEP YOU UP
ALL NIGHT.

37:35.333 --> 37:38.583
YOU TALKED FOR 8 HOURS
ABOUT ULYSSES.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.917
YEAH, I KNOW.
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD

37:40.917 --> 37:44.125
TO GET THAT TEACHING
ASSISTANT STUFF
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

37:44.125 --> 37:45.166
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE REALLY
PASSIONATE

37:45.166 --> 37:46.542
ABOUT SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW?

37:46.542 --> 37:49.625
'CAUSE THEN
YOUR INNER GEEK
JUST RUNS WILD.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.417
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU,
JOEY POTTER?

37:52.417 --> 37:54.125
WHAT ARE YOU
PASSIONATE ABOUT?

37:54.125 --> 37:55.375
WHAT ARE YOU
A GEEK FOR?

37:56.208 --> 37:58.208
MMM, I DON'T KNOW.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.375
UM, I WISH I DID,
BUT...

38:02.583 --> 38:04.542
BUT?

38:04.542 --> 38:05.625
WELL, FOR THE PAST
COUPLE OF YEARS,

38:05.625 --> 38:08.917
MY LIFE HAS KIND OF
REVOLVED AROUND THIS BOY.

38:08.917 --> 38:11.458
HOW PATHETIC IS THAT?

38:13.041 --> 38:15.959
BUT YOU GUYS
AREN'T TOGETHER?

38:15.959 --> 38:17.291
NO.

38:18.375 --> 38:21.375
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A MANIFOLD IS?

38:22.792 --> 38:24.959
IT'S A MATH THING,
IT'S HARD TO
EXPLAIN.

38:24.959 --> 38:28.875
BUT IMAGINE YOURSELF
SHRUNK TO THE SIZE
OF A PINPOINT,

38:28.875 --> 38:30.542
SITTING
ON THE SURFACE
OF A DOUGHNUT.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.125
LOOK AROUND YOU,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE

38:32.125 --> 38:33.458
YOU'RE SITTING ON
A FLAT DISK, RIGHT?

38:33.458 --> 38:36.667
BUT GO DOWN
ONE DIMENSION
AND SIT ON A CURVE,

38:36.667 --> 38:37.583
AND SUDDENLY
THE STRETCH NEARBY

38:37.583 --> 38:40.333
LOOKS LIKE
A STRAIGHT LINE.

38:40.333 --> 38:43.792
YOU KIND OF LOST ME
SOMEWHERE AROUND
THE DOUGHNUT.

38:43.792 --> 38:47.625
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE WAY SOMETHING
APPEARS FROM AFAR

38:47.625 --> 38:49.000
MIGHT BE
QUITE DIFFERENT

38:49.000 --> 38:51.959
FROM THE WAY
IT APPEARS TO YOUR
NEARSIGHTED EYE.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.959
SO IN ORDER FOR ME
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT,

38:54.959 --> 38:57.500
I SHOULD GIVE MYSELF
SOME DISTANCE.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.000
TAKE YOUR FACE
OUT OF THE iBOOK.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.166
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I WERE TO, YOU KNOW,

39:09.166 --> 39:12.417
PHONE YOU SOMETIME?

39:15.583 --> 39:17.291
IT WOULDN'T SUCK.

39:17.625 --> 39:19.375
OK.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.875
DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

39:22.875 --> 39:23.834
OH, YEAH.

39:23.834 --> 39:25.875
DO YOU HAVE
A PIECE OF PAPER?

39:25.875 --> 39:28.959
UM, NO.

40:01.125 --> 40:02.291
BYE.

40:04.792 --> 40:05.792
BYE.

40:13.083 --> 40:16.333
JOEY. HEY,
THIS IS, UH, NIKKI.
NIKKI, JOEY.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.875
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.500
SHE'S GOING
TO OUR SCHOOL.

40:25.208 --> 40:27.333
WHO'S THAT?

40:29.834 --> 40:31.625
MY ROOMMATE.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.542
IS IT JUST ME,
OR DOES THE PROSPECT
OF GOING TO COLLEGE

40:42.542 --> 40:45.500
SUDDENLY LOOM
A LOT LARGER?

40:46.125 --> 40:47.959
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

40:47.959 --> 40:50.041
IS IT THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL,

40:50.041 --> 40:51.625
OR IS IT
AN ONCOMING SEMI?

40:52.208 --> 40:54.625
OR IS IT BOTH?

40:57.125 --> 41:00.041
WELL...IT'S DEFINITELY GOING
TO TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO.

41:00.041 --> 41:04.125
HUH...HEH.

41:04.125 --> 41:06.959
DO YOU EVER HAVE ONE
OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE
YOU JUST KINDA REALIZE

41:06.959 --> 41:10.542
THAT THE WORLD HAS
SNUCK UP AND COMPLETELY
BLINDSIDED YOU?

41:13.458 --> 41:16.166
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
A CAREER IN FAST FOOD.

41:17.458 --> 41:19.375
WELCOME TO TACO BELL.
CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER?

41:19.375 --> 41:21.583
IT JUST KINDA ROLLS
OFF THE TONGUE.

41:21.583 --> 41:25.000
DAWSON...EVERYTHING IN LIFE
IS NOT JUST ABOUT WINNING.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.959
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO FIND JOY
IN THE PROCESS.

41:26.959 --> 41:29.083
YOU HAVE TO LOVE
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO.

41:30.166 --> 41:31.667
GOOD POINT.

41:32.792 --> 41:34.959
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,

41:34.959 --> 41:37.542
WHAT LIFE LESSONS
DID YOU STUMBLE UPON
THIS WEEKEND?

41:39.458 --> 41:41.542
WELL...

41:42.708 --> 41:44.375
WELL, COLLEGE TO ME
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

41:44.375 --> 41:46.333
ABOUT GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF CAPESIDE, RIGHT?

41:46.333 --> 41:48.083
RIGHT.

41:48.083 --> 41:50.834
NOW I'M THINKING THAT
IT COULD BE MORE THAN THAT.

41:50.834 --> 41:52.500
I MEAN, IT'S SCARY, SURE,

41:52.500 --> 41:56.458
BUT...IT'S THIS WORLD
FULL WITH THESE DEEPLY
PASSIONATE PEOPLE.

41:56.458 --> 42:01.000
I MEAN, PEOPLE WHO
GET EXCITED ABOUT BOOKS
AND IDEAS AND THEORIES AND...

42:03.208 --> 42:05.834
IT KIND OF EXCITED ME.

42:05.834 --> 42:08.208
MY SUSPICIONS
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.

42:08.208 --> 42:10.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:10.667 --> 42:14.250
YOU ARE A REALLY...
BIG GEEK.

42:22.417 --> 42:25.959
SO IS IT JUST ME, OR...

42:25.959 --> 42:29.083
DOES THIS ROOM
SEEM A LOT SMALLER
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

42:30.500 --> 42:32.083
REALLY?

42:34.166 --> 42:37.291
I WAS JUST
KINDA THINKING
IT SEEMED...SAFE.

42:50.458 --> 42:52.542
I'LL SEE YA, DAWSON.

42:54.041 --> 42:55.875
I'LL SEE YA, JOEY.
