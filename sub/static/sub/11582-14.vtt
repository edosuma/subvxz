(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.437 --> 00:06.707
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.577
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.610 --> 00:11.812
who investigate these
vicious felonies are members

00:11.845 --> 00:14.682
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.784
These are their stories.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.089
Took longer than I thought.

00:21.122 --> 00:25.193
Yeah, I had a little problem
I had to straighten out.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.396
I'm on Broome and Wooster.
You got anything close?

00:28.429 --> 00:31.065
All right, but hurry up,
because I'm absolutely freezing.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.166
[tires screech]

00:33.201 --> 00:34.668
Unh!

00:34.702 --> 00:35.736
[thud]

00:35.769 --> 00:36.770
[groans]

00:36.804 --> 00:39.640
(man on cell phone)
Hello? Melody?

00:39.673 --> 00:41.109
[moaning]

00:41.142 --> 00:42.243
[car door opening and closing]

00:42.276 --> 00:43.711
Melody?

00:43.744 --> 00:46.780
[approaching footsteps]

00:46.814 --> 00:49.117
What do we got?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.752
Female, late 20s,
no ID, no purse,

00:51.785 --> 00:53.221
and not a whole lot
of clothes.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.189
Night desk said
she was run over?

00:55.223 --> 00:57.625
This is the first
hit-and-run rape I've ever seen.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.194
Car drives up
onto the sidewalk.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.596
She's standing right here
when she gets hit.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.266
Impact smashes her right knee,
knocks her down.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.334
She falls off to the side.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.602
She left a trail of blood.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.371
Some of the spots
have been smeared.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.173
Looks like she
tried to crawl.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.809
He only lets her
get this far.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.245
Perp came after her?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.713
Car skids to a stop,
perp gets out,

01:19.747 --> 01:22.082
rips off her clothes,
and takes her purse.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.387
Wow.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.456
He rape her here
or somewhere else?

01:28.489 --> 01:29.390
I don't know.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.459
But this is where
he beat her to death.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.695
And no one to hear
her cry for help.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.696
Who called it in?

01:35.729 --> 01:38.132
911.
Anonymous.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.533
Latifah took the call.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.403
It came from a payphone uptown,
quarter after midnight.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.405
Okay, here's what I got.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.207
(Latifah on phone)
Police dispatch,
what is your emergency?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.642
(man on phone)
There's been an accident.
Corner of Broome and Wooster.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.977
Pedestrian struck.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.245
(Latifah)
Where are you calling from,
sir?

01:51.279 --> 01:54.182
(man)
I think she's hurt.
Send a bus.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.316
(Latifah)
And that's it.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.185
Payphone's at nine-seven
and Lexington.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.286
Thanks, Doll.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.455
"Pedestrian struck.
Send a bus."

02:01.489 --> 02:02.490
Sounds like cop talk.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.258
How does a cop
on the Upper East Side

02:04.292 --> 02:05.726
know about an accident
downtown?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.561
Unless he's the one
who ran her over.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.312
That's our Jane Doe.
Rape exam found fluids.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.580
M.E.'s running the DNA.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.382
Anything off the canvass?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.684
No, that area's pretty
isolated at night.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.918
She was hit below the knee,

03:04.952 --> 03:06.587
so we figure
it was a sports car.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.755
Any forensics?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.957
Black paint fragments.
Lab's analyzing.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.759
So...

03:11.792 --> 03:13.761
here is our crime scene.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.963
And here's the payphone
where the 911 call was made.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.731
Now, the 2-7
is the closest precinct,

03:17.765 --> 03:19.600
but they had no mobile
or foot patrols

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
anywhere near that phone.
CSU's dusting for prints.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.304
Maybe our guy was off duty.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.738
I'll check with personnel
for a list of cops

03:24.772 --> 03:25.639
with black sports cars.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.841
The body is covered
with deep bruises

03:27.875 --> 03:29.076
and puncture wounds.

03:29.109 --> 03:31.745
He beats the crap out of her
and then stabs her

03:31.779 --> 03:32.646
with something
like a screwdriver.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.716
Either he was on PCP,
or this is personal.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.984
Stabler.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.686
You want to go public,
Captain?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.555
If nothing pans out,
we may have to.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.690
When does your homicide
course start?

03:44.558 --> 03:45.593
Ah, two hours ago.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.395
Get going.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.397
Fin, you run this
with Eliot.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.631
Captain?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.800
Crime lab's got something
on the payphone.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.671
(O'Halloran)
Hundreds of prints
all over the phone box.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.839
Normally takes days to check,

03:58.872 --> 04:00.908
but our caller
made the job easier.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.510
Handset's been
wiped clean.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.811
Fits our theory
the guy's a cop.

04:03.844 --> 04:04.912
He tried to get rid
of the evidence.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.447
Except he screwed up.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.548
He cleaned the phone,

04:07.581 --> 04:08.882
but he left
a perfect index print

04:08.916 --> 04:10.451
on the disconnect button.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.721
Which gave us
a ten-point match

04:13.754 --> 04:16.624
to a member of the NYPD.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.759
Tony Nasreddin, NYPD.

04:18.792 --> 04:22.863
Temporarily assigned to
the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.465
Her guy knows
what happened last night,

04:24.498 --> 04:25.766
but Lieutenant Moore's
hiding him behind

04:25.799 --> 04:27.401
some national security crap.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.636
My guy doesn't
know anything.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.304
He made the 911 call.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.705
He broke cover and every
rule in the book

04:31.739 --> 04:33.040
to make that call.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.443
The Feds find out,
and they'll have his detail.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.978
(Kragen)
You said he broke cover.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.647
You were doing surveillance.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.648
I can't say.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.749
But he saw what happened?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.851
He didn't see anything.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.654
So he must've heard
something.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.088
Believe me, I'm sorry
about your victim,

04:48.121 --> 04:49.957
but I've gotta look
at the big picture.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.459
Take a look at ours.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.661
That woman was run over,
raped, beaten.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.830
Please, just let us
talk to Nasreddin.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.568
[sighs] He's all we've got.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.439
All right, I'll help you.

05:05.473 --> 05:09.810
But this cannot go public
or be used at trial. Agreed?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.548
Agreed.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.786
(Moore)
We're running surveillance

05:18.819 --> 05:21.422
on a crooked Filipino
businessman who wires funds

05:21.455 --> 05:23.424
to charities in the Far East
who are known

05:23.457 --> 05:25.893
to support
terrorist groups.

05:27.861 --> 05:31.899
Tony Nasreddin, Lori Anglin:
Detectives Stabler and Tutuola.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.967
What's this Filipino guy
got to do with our case?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.670
We've tapped
all his phones.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.871
Caught him having
a conversation

05:37.905 --> 05:40.107
with one of his...
employees.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.678
(man's voice)
Hey, where've you been?

05:44.712 --> 05:45.879
(Melody)
Took longer than I thought.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.882
I had a little problem
I had to straighten out.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.151
I'm on Broome and Wooster.
You got anything close?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.487
(man)
Client in Chelsea.
Want the address?

05:53.521 --> 05:56.390
(Melody)
All right, but hurry up,
'cause I'm absolutely freezing.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
She's a hooker.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.093
Our perp must have taken
her cell phone too.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.696
(man)
Melody?
It's 374 21st Street--

06:02.730 --> 06:03.764
[crash]

06:03.797 --> 06:07.501
(man)
Hello? Melody?
Melody?

06:07.535 --> 06:08.802
[door creaking open]

06:08.836 --> 06:11.772
(perp)
That's a pretty name.
Like music.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.841
(man)
Who's this?
Where is she?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.609
(perp)
She can't come to the phone
right now.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.711
Now she wants to play with us.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.080
[dial tone]
That's it.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.782
I knew something
had gone bad.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.484
I had to call it in.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.885
Whoa, her pimp's cold.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.119
Hears one of his girls
get taken out

06:26.153 --> 06:26.987
and doesn't do squat.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.389
We want his name
and a copy of that tape.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.994
His name's Eddie Shaw.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.031
(Eddie)
Hold on!

06:38.065 --> 06:40.067
I am busy.
Come back later.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.034
What the hell you doing?

06:41.068 --> 06:43.537
We want to talk to you
about one of your girls.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.739
I don't have girls.
Import/export only.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.608
You running
a prostitution service.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.209
No.
Companionship only.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.645
My ladies are very intelligent,
very respectable.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.113
This lady's dead.
Who is she?

06:53.146 --> 06:54.181
Never seen her before.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.783
Okay.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.951
What do you say I call Vice,
the IRS, and Immigration,

06:57.985 --> 06:59.653
they come down here
and beat up on your ass?

06:59.687 --> 07:01.955
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
She's Melody Quinn.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.225
She was Melody Quinn.
She working last night?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.660
Escort only.
No sexual services.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.061
We need a client list.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.129
That's confidential.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.531
Okay, you know?
Fine.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.865
You're gonna rot in jail
until you remember.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.767
Okay.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.838
She have a boyfriend?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.640
No. She was studying.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.875
Uh, wanted to be a broker
in Wall Street.

07:24.111 --> 07:29.216
Here. 8:30 p.m.
First client was Mr. Prasad.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.519
Mr. Prasad!

07:31.552 --> 07:34.488
Were you screwing
this woman last night?

07:34.522 --> 07:35.823
She visited my apartment.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.958
We need you to provide
a DNA sample.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.527
As long as you
don't tell my wife.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.894
She was out of town
last night,

07:40.928 --> 07:43.697
and I gave in to temptation
just once.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.998
Really?
The agency says you were

07:45.032 --> 07:45.999
one of Melody's regulars.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.668
You got a car?

07:47.701 --> 07:48.702
(man)
I don't have to answer that.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.904
I hired Melody
for a dinner date.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.172
We didn't have sex.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.874
You know,
I didn't break the law.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.776
And you can't prove
that I did.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.080
She's dead.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.682
You were the last man
with her,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.951
so your DNA's gonna be
all over her.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.753
It might even prove
you murdered her.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.892
Okay, okay.
We had sex.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.595
But she was alive
when she left, I swear.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.966
What kind of car
you drive?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.034
Lincoln Navigator.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.037
None of Melody's clients had
access to a black sports car.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.105
The fact that
she's a hooker

08:25.138 --> 08:26.974
explains the fluids
in the rape kit.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.008
You think she wasn't raped?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.543
Hard to prove
either way.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.579
Cast the net wider,
all her Johns.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.847
Her parents are coming in
from Detroit to ID the body.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.082
Talk to them too.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.550
What about the JTTF tape?

08:36.584 --> 08:38.552
(Fin)
TARU's still working on it.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.988
Oh, Kathy dropped him off
about five minutes ago.

08:41.021 --> 08:41.922
Said she couldn't wait.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.691
Dickie's staying with me
for a few nights.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.093
Say, kiddo!
Stop looking at that stuff.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.928
Is that woman dead?

08:47.961 --> 08:48.996
Yes, she is.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.231
How'd she die?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.634
She was hit by a car.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.335
An accident?
No.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.905
The car drove up
on the sidewalk.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.941
Did they take her money?

09:00.974 --> 09:03.977
Yeah, they did.
Let's get something to eat.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.813
I bet they
beat her up too.

09:08.081 --> 09:08.816
Why would you say that?

09:08.849 --> 09:11.885
It's just like the game,
isn't it?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.120
What game?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.355
NtenCity.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.159
Cap, Fin, have you ever heard
of a game called NtenCity?

09:19.192 --> 09:22.095
I'm driving along, okay?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.732
I see a woman, so...
I run her over.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.102
Where did you learn this?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.704
Everyone plays it.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.175
I get out of the car.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.211
(game character)
Hey, baby, where you goin'?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.648
Now, to get her money,
I have to knock her out.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.149
Make sure she
can't fight back.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.918
(game character)
Where do you think
you're goin', bitch?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.153
Unh!

09:46.186 --> 09:48.889
Got her.
Now I gotta get the purse.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.726
(game character)
I said stay down!

09:54.127 --> 09:55.328
Yeah. Gimme that!

09:55.362 --> 09:57.064
Got me some more cheddar.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.166
Look, my money supply
just went up.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.203
[turns off game]

10:03.236 --> 10:04.972
They got the idea
from the game.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.740
Remember the voice
on the tape?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.175
"She can't come to the phone
right now.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.643
She wants to play
with us."

10:10.844 --> 10:13.013
Somebody's playing
for real.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.288
A lot of psychologists think
there's a correlation

10:21.321 --> 10:23.323
between violent crimes
and media violence,

10:23.356 --> 10:24.692
especially games.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.793
Do you believe that?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.928
I can think of a dozen murders
in which computer games

10:27.961 --> 10:29.963
were alleged to have
influenced the killers.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.431
Columbine's
the obvious example.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.900
Do you have
any suspects?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.902
No, we checked out family,
friends, and clients.

10:34.935 --> 10:35.736
Everybody has alibis.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.738
So she could have been
a random target.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.039
That's an awful lot of rage
to take out

10:39.072 --> 10:40.040
on someone you don't know.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.375
Unless the computer game
contributed to the rage.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.979
You got any pointers
to help us find our player?

10:46.013 --> 10:47.080
Your average gamer's
probably male,

10:47.114 --> 10:48.916
anywhere from 10
to 50 years old.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.051
Thanks, Doc.

10:51.084 --> 10:51.985
And if he's
an NtenCit junkie,

10:52.019 --> 10:53.921
he might want to brag
about what he's done.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.023
Who makes this crap?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.928
(man)
Yeah, I designed NtenCity.
What's up?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.462
Someone went out
and imitated it.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.964
Not again.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.033
We got lawsuits
coming out of our asses.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.769
Every month some moron
blames us for some crime

11:08.802 --> 11:10.003
some other moron
committed.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.972
You don't seem
too concerned.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.175
Our games are cartoons.
They're fun.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.010
If a couple of idiots
take them too far,

11:17.044 --> 11:18.178
that's not our problem.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.847
Well, it is now.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.348
This woman was run down
two nights ago

11:21.381 --> 11:24.017
and beaten to death,
just like in the game.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.387
Jeez, lighten up,
will ya?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.389
That sequence
was an Easter Egg.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.257
A what?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.959
That's a hidden treat
players can access

11:31.992 --> 11:33.794
for extra fun.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.028
You're not as old as you look.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.230
Come here.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.400
So you're playing the game,
okay?

11:40.433 --> 11:41.935
And you see something
anomalous.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.072
Maybe a glow on the wall,
a doorway.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.841
You go through
and you get something extra.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.377
A weapon, money,
maybe another cool sequence.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.812
Who knows about
the Easter Eggs?

11:51.845 --> 11:52.846
Everybody.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.748
You go online and
the fan sites will tell you

11:54.782 --> 11:55.949
where the Easter Eggs
are hidden.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.085
On these fan sites,

11:58.118 --> 12:00.087
anybody talking about a woman
being attacked?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.755
We're about to launch
NtenCity 2.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.024
I don't have time
to go trolling on fan sites.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.393
I do.
Move over.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.728
That was Stabler.
You stay and play.
All right.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.167
Cause of death was
a subdural hematoma,

12:14.201 --> 12:16.136
but she suffered
before she died.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.038
There were 42 points of impact

12:18.071 --> 12:20.040
on her chest, back,
arms, and head.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.776
Guy's fists
must be chopped meat.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.311
I doubt it.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.013
These bruises were caused
by a man's shoe,

12:26.046 --> 12:27.547
kicking and stomping.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.149
Probably a size nine.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.550
What about
the puncture wounds?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.219
They were a puzzle.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.189
I had to cut the wounds out
so I could dissect them.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.292
This is your weapon.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.194
Not my normal work gear,

12:41.228 --> 12:43.130
but it's the annual
M.E.'s dinner tonight.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.199
Stiletto heels?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.268
A woman stomped Melody?

12:48.301 --> 12:51.071
Was there another woman's voice
on that task force tape?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.106
(perp)
She can't come
to the phone right now.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.207
Now she wants to play
with us.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.010
That's a guy's voice.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.478
But if I filter
the background noise

12:58.511 --> 12:59.913
and EQ the vocal spectrum,

12:59.947 --> 13:02.149
we get this.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.350
(perp)
She wants to play with us.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.152
(woman)
Her jacket.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.054
[rewinding tape]

13:09.156 --> 13:10.490
(woman muffled)
Dig her jacket.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.859
Dig her jacket.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.226
That's a female's voice.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.095
And they killed her
for her clothes?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.897
No, they were
playing a game.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.165
Munch has got something.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.800
All right.
Thanks.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.503
Some geek wrote a new scene
in the game

13:23.536 --> 13:25.038
you can download
off the net.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.373
It first appeared
late last night.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.374
Here it is.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.441
Okay, same old same old.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.709
You run her over,

13:29.742 --> 13:32.980
get out, kick her
a couple of times, and then...

13:33.013 --> 13:36.116
Watch this.
Here's the new scene.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.150
He tears her blouse off.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.618
Cool, huh?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.387
The detail about
ripping her clothes off

13:40.420 --> 13:41.821
was never released.

13:41.855 --> 13:46.059
(Munch)
Son of a bitch knew
exactly what happened.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.028
So, which one of you guys
made this?

13:48.061 --> 13:51.031
It can only be one person,
a programmer named Stu Davis.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.532
Why only him?

13:52.565 --> 13:53.967
Well, Stu used to work here.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.102
I had to fire him

13:55.135 --> 13:56.169
'cause he snuck
copulating bunny rabbits

13:56.203 --> 13:58.238
into a children's game
we make.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.506
But we kept him on
as a tester.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.141
So he knows how
to modify the game?

14:01.174 --> 14:02.475
Oh, yeah.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.978
Where's Stu live?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.382
(Stu)
Sorry, I don't know
any murdered women.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.184
Somebody dropped
a little sequence about her

14:11.218 --> 14:13.286
into NtenCity.
Wasn't me.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.088
We hear you're the only guy
that could do it.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.423
Well, you heard wrong.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.091
Stuart Davis,
this is a warrant

14:18.125 --> 14:20.227
to search your apartment
and computers.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.194
Ow! Damn!

14:21.228 --> 14:22.963
Out of my way.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.235
You know,
if you guys just tell me

14:28.268 --> 14:29.536
what you're looking for,
I'll help.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.971
Yeah, help erase it.

14:31.004 --> 14:31.771
Uh, here's something.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.007
Email sent yesterday morning.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.375
Hey, you know what?
That's my private stuff!

14:35.408 --> 14:36.376
You're not supposed
to look--

14:36.409 --> 14:38.311
Shut up!

14:38.345 --> 14:40.147
"Spielmeister,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.182
"wanna make NtenCity
real Ntense?

14:42.215 --> 14:45.118
Check out The Ledger
page seven."

14:45.152 --> 14:46.954
Will ya look at this?

14:46.987 --> 14:48.421
And it's turned
right to page seven.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.291
"Mystery Woman Killed
in Hit and Run."

14:51.324 --> 14:52.292
Listen to this.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.360
"Cops held back

14:53.393 --> 14:54.361
"chick was half naked.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.930
How about a game update."

14:56.964 --> 14:58.131
L-M-A-O.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.132
L-M-A-O?

14:59.166 --> 15:02.102
Shorthand:
Laughing My Ass Off.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.270
That's funny.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.471
Who sent you
the email?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.405
I have no idea, okay?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.307
I get requests from goofballs
every day.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.709
You always do
what goofballs ask?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.212
If they pay well enough,
yeah.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.213
Got an email address?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.481
Just a screen name: Lewddude.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.249
Can you track it?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.589
Larry Tauber, Police!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.195
(Fin)
Nobody's here.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.565
Here's a picture
of Lewddude.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.337
All right.
Get that out there.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.174
El, maybe the guy
couldn't stop playing.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.642
Yeah, or partying.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.714
A woman's purse.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.685
It's Melody Quinn's
driver's license.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.454
Genius really knows
how to cover his tracks.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.324
He didn't go too far.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.625
Genius forgot his car keys.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.461
Little black sports car.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.196
Registered
to Larry Tauber.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.097
Blood and skin.
We'll test it.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.465
(radio)
Unit six?
O'Halloran.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.234
SVU there?
Yeah, they're here.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.002
Tell them we got their guy.
Spring and ten.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.603
They found your guy.
Ten blocks away.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.342
Heard the call go out.
It's your guy.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.210
ID was in his pocket.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.446
Looks like he was run over,
then beaten to death.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.217
Larry Tauber.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.287
Someone's
playing the game again.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.391
Cause of death was
massive head trauma

16:31.424 --> 16:32.459
and multiple fractures,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.427
but Larry Tauber
wasn't murdered.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.163
Suicide.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.397
He sustained one blow
to the head

16:37.430 --> 16:38.598
from a sharp metal object.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.468
CSU found blood and brain matter
on the edge of the dumpster.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.569
Remember that scaffolding?

16:42.602 --> 16:45.638
He must've jumped off of it
and hit the dumpster.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.040
Any evidence
he was pushed?

16:47.074 --> 16:48.608
Not from the trajectory
of the fall,

16:48.641 --> 16:51.511
and there were no defensive
wounds or torn clothes.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.547
But his blood alcohol level
was four times the legal limit.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.416
Killed himself out of
drunken remorse.

16:56.449 --> 17:00.187
What he did to that girl,
I'm not shedding any tears.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.489
DNA proves
his car ran her down,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.157
but I don't think
he killed her.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.758
His feet are size 11.

17:05.792 --> 17:09.329
Shoes that kicked Melody
to death were size 9.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.264
So he goes ten blocks
to kill himself.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.466
What's wrong with
his own roof?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.435
I can't answer that,
but I can tell you

17:15.468 --> 17:18.605
what he was doing
before he jumped.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.440
See the glitter
on his pants?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.476
Known in the trade
as booty dust.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.278
Larry had himself
one last lap dance

17:25.312 --> 17:28.081
before he took the plunge.
[sighs]

17:28.115 --> 17:29.516
Well the only strip clubs
around that alley

17:29.549 --> 17:32.285
are by the
West Side Highway.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.553
Yeah, I know.
Can you believe it?

17:33.586 --> 17:37.124
Police.
Ladies, can we get a minute?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.425
That all you need, honey?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.693
Either one of you
recognize him?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.463
Yeah, I do.
He was here last night.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.565
Remember the sad dude?

17:45.598 --> 17:47.134
He was literally
crying in his beer.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.468
His friend tried
to cheer him up

17:48.501 --> 17:50.103
with a couple
bottles of Dom.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.438
His friend?

17:51.471 --> 17:52.572
Good-looking kid.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.542
Too young to be at the club,
but guess his ID was okay.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.177
You got security cameras?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.245
Yeah, but they're
like the plumbing,

17:58.278 --> 17:59.312
don't work.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.314
Did you hear anything
these guys were talking about?

18:01.348 --> 18:02.549
Not really.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.252
Younger one even paid for me
to give sad eyes a lap dance,

18:05.285 --> 18:06.753
but it was like
raising the dead,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.421
if you know what I mean?

18:08.455 --> 18:10.223
Okay, we're gonna need
you ladies to come down

18:10.257 --> 18:12.859
to the precinct
and talk to a sketch artist.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.195
How many people do you put
at the crime scene?

18:15.228 --> 18:16.329
Maybe three.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.797
Unidentified male,
unidentified female,

18:17.830 --> 18:19.566
and Larry Tauber.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.334
Now, we got
two possibilities.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.370
Either Tauber
made the kids take part--

18:23.403 --> 18:24.771
Why do you say
they're kids?

18:24.804 --> 18:25.772
The voices sounded young.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.807
18, 19.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.242
Tauber's nearly 30.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.877
So he led them
into the crime,

18:30.910 --> 18:32.479
and then killed himself
out of guilt.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.282
Or, he's the patsy.
Kids used him.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.484
His apartment, his computer,
his car.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.420
Maybe used him
to buy drugs, alcohol.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.256
Can you prove
any of that?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.658
Look, Tauber left Melody's
purse in plain sight.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.527
He didn't even bother
to fix his car?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.928
It's like he wanted
to get caught.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.631
But he's dead,
so he can't tell us.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.599
(Fin)
But the car can.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.568
The crime lab ran tests on it.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.937
The driver's side door
gives off a weird metallic creak

18:57.970 --> 19:00.540
that's audible
on the task force tape.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.310
They tracked each set
of footsteps.

19:03.343 --> 19:07.580
They're 95% certain that the guy
that got out the driver's door

19:07.614 --> 19:09.416
is the same one that picked up
Melody's phone

19:09.449 --> 19:10.683
and talked on the tape.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.752
His voice wasn't Tauber's.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.554
They're also pretty sure
that only two people

19:14.587 --> 19:17.424
got out of that car.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.426
And the second one
was wearing high heels.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.294
So Tauber just stayed
in his car?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.595
And did nothing
while a helpless woman

19:22.629 --> 19:26.233
was brutally murdered.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.968
I'm sorry, but "95% certain"
and "pretty sure"

19:29.001 --> 19:30.570
don't add up to
beyond a reasonable doubt.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.605
(Stabler)
Look. If these kids
were using Tauber,

19:32.639 --> 19:34.441
somebody must have
seen them together.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.677
As soon as
the pole dancers are done,

19:37.710 --> 19:39.212
canvass Tauber's neighbors.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.213
Try this first.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.549
Day after the murder,
Tauber received 12 calls

19:42.582 --> 19:46.586
from a cell phone belonging
to one Louise Karnaki.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.557
17 years old.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.858
Larry's a loser.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.693
I don't hang with him
anymore.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.762
(Fin)
Then why call him
so often?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.431
Dunno.
See how he's doing?

19:58.465 --> 19:59.832
Not too good.
He's dead.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.536
Oh, my God...

20:03.570 --> 20:04.904
poor Larry.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.240
Where were you
three nights ago?

20:07.274 --> 20:08.741
At home.
Can you prove it?

20:08.775 --> 20:09.942
Why should she?

20:09.976 --> 20:13.613
Hey, Louise.
I'm Elliot.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.782
Nice boots.
Very sharp.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.884
They're mine.
How'd you get 'em?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.719
Something called
a search warrant.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.688
What is this?
Turn on the lights.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.755
Let me do
my magic trick.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.792
Now, Louise,
this is a lumalight.

20:25.825 --> 20:29.462
What it does is show up
blood and skin fragments,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.964
like, for example,
if there just happened

20:31.998 --> 20:33.800
to be some on
your boot here.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.602
Will you look at that?

20:35.635 --> 20:36.769
I don't know
what that is.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.871
(Stabler)
It's blood.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.308
There's some
on the toe also.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.944
Now what we're gonna do
is compare the DNA on this boot

20:44.977 --> 20:47.314
to that woman's DNA.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.817
And when they match,
which they will,

20:50.850 --> 20:52.952
we'll be charging you
with murder.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.691
You gotta help me.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.295
I wanna talk to the ADA.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.566
Mr. Delroy?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.000
If my client cooperates,
what are you offering?

21:08.034 --> 21:10.870
Nothing.
She's a murderer.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.572
Now if she tells us
what happened,

21:12.605 --> 21:13.773
I might ask the judge
to take it into account

21:13.806 --> 21:14.774
during sentencing.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.909
Did you attack that woman?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.651
Yes.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.486
Who else was there
with you?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.022
Larry Tauber.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.358
And who else?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.392
Nobody.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.728
Not even him?

21:45.838 --> 21:48.074
Give us a name.

21:52.545 --> 21:56.783
Please don't tell him
I told you.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.585
Name.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.857
Garrett Perle.

22:06.793 --> 22:07.994
Police!

22:08.027 --> 22:09.028
It's open.

22:10.029 --> 22:10.997
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

22:11.030 --> 22:11.998
Police.
Stand up.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.033
Sure, just a sec.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.835
Bastards deleting files!

22:15.868 --> 22:17.370
Temper, temper.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.871
Garret Perle,
you're under arrest for murder.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.239
Get that computer.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.375
(Garrett)
Be my guest,
there's nothing on it.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.910
Anyway, whom am I meant
to have murdered?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.912
Melody Quinn.
Doesn't ring a bell.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.380
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.415
You give up that right.
Stop!

22:32.819 --> 22:34.821
He's got a degaussing loop.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.889
What the hell is that?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.525
Powerful magnetic strips.

22:38.558 --> 22:43.129
We just wiped
his hard drive.

22:43.162 --> 22:46.666
This is Melody Quinn.
Remember her now?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.869
I'm sorry, but I don't.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.938
First you ran her down,
then you kicked her.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.139
42 times.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.675
[scoffs]

22:55.708 --> 22:58.911
Awful.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.981
That's a Marine tattoo,
isn't it?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.516
Have you ever
killed anyone?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.655
You have, I can tell.

23:08.688 --> 23:09.922
You too.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.691
Were you a gang banger
before you became a cop?

23:15.662 --> 23:16.963
I've often wondered
what it would be like

23:16.996 --> 23:18.164
to kill someone.

23:18.197 --> 23:21.468
So how was it?

23:21.501 --> 23:23.903
I've murdered people in games,
hundreds of them.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.205
I've blown their heads off,
eviscerated them.

23:26.238 --> 23:31.110
I've even used a little
kitty cat as a silencer.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.545
But it's not real, you know?

23:32.579 --> 23:36.549
You don't get the bam!

23:36.583 --> 23:39.619
The kick, the juice.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.954
But you guys, you know.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.824
You know.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.025
And you don't?

23:48.561 --> 23:50.162
You don't.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.967
Because you're gutless.

23:58.705 --> 23:59.939
You couldn't even face her,
could you?

23:59.972 --> 24:02.809
You had to use a car

24:02.842 --> 24:05.545
to knock down a woman?

24:05.578 --> 24:06.946
Even then, you couldn't
face her.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.181
You had to sneak up behind her
as she was crawling away,

24:09.215 --> 24:10.917
and then you kicked her?

24:15.555 --> 24:16.956
You're nothing
but a scared little punk.

24:21.027 --> 24:24.697
You wanna know what it's like
to kill someone, huh?

24:24.731 --> 24:26.499
And you gotta stare 'em
right in the eye

24:26.533 --> 24:27.934
so you can
smell their fear.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.737
Leave me alone, okay?
Stop it.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.711
We don't even need
this little freak.

24:38.745 --> 24:39.712
We've got our witness.

24:39.746 --> 24:40.947
She's lying.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.683
How do you know that?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.186
It was Larry Tauber.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.788
Doesn't sound like Tauber.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.289
(Eddie on tape)
Melody?

24:50.322 --> 24:52.892
(Garrett on tape)
That's a pretty name.
Like music.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.894
(Eddie)
Who's this?
Where is she?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.196
(Garrett)
She can't come
to the phone right now.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.799
Now she wants to play
with us.

25:01.668 --> 25:02.902
Where did you
get that?

25:02.935 --> 25:07.239
That's enough
for a positive voice ID.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.076
You're done, Garrett.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.980
But it's Larry's fault.
He made me do it.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.849
Out you go, gentlemen.

25:16.883 --> 25:20.653
I'd like to speak
to my client alone.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.991
With Louise's
eye-witness testimony,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.026
Gates will try
and cut a deal.

25:27.059 --> 25:27.894
So what are you
gonna do?

25:27.927 --> 25:29.662
I may offer Louise Man-one
to make sure

25:29.696 --> 25:31.030
she gives us this creep.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.034
Oliver, how will you
be earning your fee this time?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.736
Easily.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.571
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

25:38.605 --> 25:41.608
You gotta be kidding me.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.142
Garrett was enthralled
with an older man, Larry Tauber,

25:43.175 --> 25:45.011
who plied him with alcohol,
got him to play

25:45.044 --> 25:47.279
violent video games
for hours on end.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.015
And then took him
on a joyride

25:49.048 --> 25:50.950
and made him play
the game for real.

25:50.983 --> 25:51.951
So Garrett admits

25:51.984 --> 25:53.085
he killed Melody.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.622
No, he admits that he had
no idea what he was doing,

25:55.655 --> 25:58.958
whether it was wrong or right,
fantasy or reality.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.160
See you
at the arraignment.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.666
Gates thinks this defense
will fly?

26:06.699 --> 26:08.868
Computer game violence
is a hot issue.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.770
If Gates can deflect blame
onto the game makers,

26:10.803 --> 26:11.838
his job's half done.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.039
Make a deal
with Louise Karnaki.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.273
Don't get
your hopes up.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.876
Her family just fired
her public defender,

26:16.909 --> 26:18.144
got a lawyer
from Henshall and Langan.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.012
How can they afford that?

26:20.046 --> 26:22.014
They can't,
but Garrett's family can.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.683
They'll pin the crime
on the game

26:23.716 --> 26:24.951
and the dead man,
Larry Tauber.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.786
Cap, it's the lab
for you.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.855
What about
the surveillance tape?

26:28.888 --> 26:29.656
What surveillance tape?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.190
The Joint Terrorism Task Force

26:31.223 --> 26:33.726
was running a covert op
on Melody's boss.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.895
They caught the start
of the murder on audio tape.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.130
Including Garrett
and Louise's voices.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.099
And they sure weren't confusing
fantasy with reality.

26:40.132 --> 26:43.102
I need to hear
that Task Force tape.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.939
We got it on condition
we wouldn't use it at trial.

26:46.973 --> 26:47.940
You agreed to that?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.709
I didn't have a choice.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.177
Well, neither do I
if it's my only evidence

26:51.210 --> 26:53.212
of Garrett's state of mind,
so where is it?

26:53.245 --> 26:54.881
Somebody from the
U.S. Attorney's Office

26:54.914 --> 26:57.049
removed it from the lab
20 minutes ago.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.890
(man)
You can't have it.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.157
As soon as that tape
appears in discovery,

27:05.191 --> 27:07.026
the defense will want to know
context, provenance, everything.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.029
It won't affect
any ongoing operation.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.163
I can't risk surveillance
of a vital target

27:11.197 --> 27:13.099
and the war against terror
becoming front page news.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.000
That's more important

27:14.033 --> 27:15.868
than letting
two psychopaths walk free?

27:15.902 --> 27:17.670
Frankly, yes.

27:17.704 --> 27:18.671
If this tape's
your only evidence,

27:18.705 --> 27:20.072
you should ask the NYPD
to get off their asses

27:20.106 --> 27:21.107
and find you some more.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.110
I met your vital target.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.045
This guy's no terrorist,
he's a sleazy joke.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.114
I need the tape, Raul.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.817
I said you can't have the tape
because there is no tape.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.924
We've got no tape
and no deal with Louise.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.391
I'm gonna be fighting this
with my arms

27:39.425 --> 27:40.760
tied behind my back.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.895
Forensics prove
Garrett and Louise

27:42.929 --> 27:44.230
kicked a woman to death.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.965
They can't wiggle
out of that.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.133
Gates is running
a psych defense.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.368
He's gonna blame everything
on the game and Larry Tauber.

27:49.401 --> 27:50.870
And the only way to beat it
is to prove they knew

27:50.903 --> 27:51.670
what they were doing.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.972
One way to beat
a psych defense

27:53.005 --> 27:54.807
is with a psych offense.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.075
Let me find out
if Garrett and Louise

27:56.108 --> 28:00.312
are innocent pawns
or cold-blooded liars.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.414
How many hours a day
do you play games?

28:02.448 --> 28:05.885
Five or six.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.788
What's the longest
that you've ever played?

28:08.821 --> 28:09.856
Eighteen hours.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.358
You get tired?

28:12.391 --> 28:15.361
I never noticed.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.464
Do you stop
to eat or drink?

28:18.497 --> 28:20.499
Don't feel the need.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.034
How do you feel after
you're finished playing?

28:22.068 --> 28:24.871
Like I'm King of the World.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.273
Then what do you do?

28:27.306 --> 28:29.175
Play again.
What else?

28:29.208 --> 28:31.811
Larry mind you
hanging around so much?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.880
Mind?

28:33.913 --> 28:36.248
We were the best thing
that ever happened to him.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.918
Larry like to watch her
beat up women.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.920
In the game
or on the street?

28:40.953 --> 28:44.223
Wherever.
Turned him on.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.426
It was the nearest
he got to screwing her.

28:47.459 --> 28:51.030
Louise got off
on it too.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.865
Garrett made me
tease him.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.934
You didn't like that?

28:54.967 --> 28:58.805
I wasn't interested
in Larry.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.372
You and Garrett
have sex?

29:00.406 --> 29:03.776
Yes.
He's crazy about me.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.277
Yeah,
but the game is better.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.847
Better than sex.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.549
And the rush is more intense.

29:10.582 --> 29:16.222
See, I control the world,
pull everyone's strings.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.456
In the game, of course.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.226
When else do you
feel the rush?

29:20.259 --> 29:21.994
Driving fast.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.996
How fast?

29:24.030 --> 29:26.899
120 miles an hour on the BQE
at 2:00 in the morning.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.001
That's pretty dangerous.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.502
That's why it's a rush.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.938
What about
the other drivers?

29:31.971 --> 29:35.107
They get out of the way.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.509
What if they can't?

29:37.543 --> 29:40.880
Oops.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.517
He's a manipulative
little prick.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.920
He took Larry Tauber
to that club, he got him drunk,

29:47.954 --> 29:49.155
and manipulated him
right off that roof.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.556
I wouldn't put it
past him.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.859
Garrett's an adrenaline junkie
and a narcissist.

29:52.892 --> 29:53.860
He knows right from wrong.

29:53.893 --> 29:54.927
He just doesn't
give a damn.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.263
And Louise?

29:57.296 --> 29:58.397
She's in love with him.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.132
She'll do whatever
he wants.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.367
Do you think these
computer games

30:01.400 --> 30:02.902
influenced his behavior?

30:02.935 --> 30:05.571
Kids like Garrett
are so numb

30:05.604 --> 30:07.139
that they need
constant stimulation.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.174
Computer games
fill that void.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.877
If they're susceptible
to violence,

30:10.910 --> 30:12.511
then this could
exacerbate that,

30:12.544 --> 30:15.381
but I don't believe a game
ever made anyone commit murder.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.050
So Garrett's psych defense
is a crock.

30:18.084 --> 30:21.220
Yes.
His mind is clear as a bell.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.489
Hah, thought I'd find you
in here, Casey.

30:23.522 --> 30:27.927
Motion to submit Garrett
for a neuropsych examination.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.462
Garrett has volunteered
to undergo a PET scan

30:30.496 --> 30:34.000
while he plays
the computer game NtenCity.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.034
An experiment
with a single subject

30:35.067 --> 30:35.935
is meaningless.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.336
We'll repeat
an experiment

30:37.369 --> 30:39.338
conducted by doctors
in London that showed

30:39.371 --> 30:42.074
that game play
flooded the brain with dopamine.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.176
What's that supposed to prove?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.344
That dopamine intoxication

30:45.377 --> 30:48.247
caused by addictive
game playing

30:48.280 --> 30:49.949
changed Garrett's brain,
and therefore,

30:49.982 --> 30:51.483
he wasn't responsible
for his actions.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.921
Are you worried about
objectivity, Casey?

30:54.954 --> 30:59.258
Because Dr. Huang
is welcome to conduct the test.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.999
The computer relays the game
into these 3D goggles

31:07.033 --> 31:08.200
so that Mr. Perle
can play the game

31:08.234 --> 31:09.535
while he's
in the scanner.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.972
Cool.
Can I get a pair of these?

31:13.005 --> 31:15.074
His head's immobilized
so that head movement

31:15.107 --> 31:16.575
doesn't distort the scan.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.411
We'll inject him
with carbon 11 raclopride

31:19.445 --> 31:21.613
to tag
the dopamine receptors.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.249
And then we'll draw blood
throughout the scan

31:23.282 --> 31:24.383
to measure how
game play affects

31:24.416 --> 31:26.018
the dopamine release
in his brain.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.954
You can start.

31:27.987 --> 31:31.623
Garrett plays these games
up to 40 hours a week.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.993
It's amazing he found the time
to commit murder.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.028
Let me know
when you have the results.

31:38.497 --> 31:42.334
[game sounds]

32:03.722 --> 32:05.157
(Huang)
No question.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.358
Garrett's dopamine level
increased

32:06.392 --> 32:08.260
while he played the game.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.629
What effect
did that have on him?

32:10.662 --> 32:13.365
He felt high, euphoric,
as if he'd just

32:13.399 --> 32:15.734
taken a small dose
of speed.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.537
So the PET scan does prove
game play made Garrett Perle

32:18.570 --> 32:20.672
less able
to control his actions?

32:20.706 --> 32:23.642
On the contrary,
almost any enjoyable activity

32:23.675 --> 32:26.045
would show the same
increase in dopamine.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.046
Driving a fast car,

32:27.079 --> 32:31.083
playing sports,
even playing chess.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.618
Thank you, Doctor.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.120
Isn't the release of dopamine

32:34.153 --> 32:37.156
what makes a drug like cocaine
so addictive?

32:37.189 --> 32:38.157
Partly.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.225
And heroin so addictive?

32:39.258 --> 32:42.061
Dopamine contributes
to addictive behavior, but--

32:42.094 --> 32:43.595
And doesn't
the PET scan show

32:43.629 --> 32:46.198
that computer games
are just as addictive?

32:46.232 --> 32:48.200
As addictive as heroin
or cocaine?

32:48.234 --> 32:50.202
No.

32:50.236 --> 32:53.205
But they are addictive.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.342
Do you believe that violent
video games are dangerous?

32:56.375 --> 32:58.044
(Huang)
Not in themselves, no.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.179
But didn't a Dr. David Grossman
compare violent games

33:00.212 --> 33:02.648
to military battlefield
simulators,

33:02.681 --> 33:05.184
where they train real soldiers
to kill?

33:05.217 --> 33:06.685
It's much more complicated
than that.

33:06.718 --> 33:07.753
Why?

33:07.786 --> 33:10.022
A violent video game

33:10.056 --> 33:11.723
teaches its players
to kill automatically.

33:11.757 --> 33:12.758
Yes or no?

33:12.791 --> 33:14.660
Yes.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.262
Thank you.
But there's an enormous
difference

33:16.295 --> 33:18.697
between the cartoon violence
of video games

33:18.730 --> 33:20.266
and violence in real life.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.502
So do you think that
Garrett and Louise

33:23.535 --> 33:26.638
would have gone out
joyriding that night

33:26.672 --> 33:28.207
if they hadn't have
played the game?

33:28.240 --> 33:29.641
(Huang)
There are other factors--

33:29.675 --> 33:32.344
Did the game give them
the idea to get in the car?

33:32.378 --> 33:33.312
Yes, but--

33:33.345 --> 33:35.581
Did the game give them
the idea to run over

33:35.614 --> 33:37.716
Melody Quinn and beat her
to death, yes or no?

33:37.749 --> 33:39.685
Yes, but having--

33:39.718 --> 33:42.188
Thank you, Dr. Huang.
Nothing further.

33:46.725 --> 33:50.062
Do you regret
what you've done?

33:50.096 --> 33:54.766
Yes.
I'll never forgive myself.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.772
[sniffles]

34:06.612 --> 34:09.648
Do you want to take a break,
Mr. Perle?

34:09.681 --> 34:13.219
No, I can manage,
thank you.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.188
You've testified that you
and Louise ran over Melody Quinn

34:16.222 --> 34:18.524
because you thought you were
still playing a game.

34:19.758 --> 34:23.495
Yes.
Nothing seemed real.

34:23.529 --> 34:27.466
So even when Melody
was screaming

34:27.499 --> 34:29.701
and crying for mercy,

34:29.735 --> 34:31.537
you thought it was
part of the game?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.505
They scream in the game too.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.141
But you kicked her
to death.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.808
You expect the jury
to believe that you didn't know

34:36.842 --> 34:40.546
a real woman was bleeding
and dying under your feet?

34:40.579 --> 34:43.715
I swear to you, I didn't.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.852
How could you not know?

34:46.885 --> 34:49.321
Because I didn't
know where I was.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.291
The streets we were driving down
were streets from the game.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.226
The people were characters
from the game.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.863
I saw this woman
on the sidewalk,

34:57.896 --> 34:59.631
and she had a short skirt.

34:59.665 --> 35:08.140
Larry said, "Get her.
Get the hooker."

35:08.174 --> 35:10.442
It was like I was
still in his apartment.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.811
And he's breathing
down my neck, shouting at me,

35:12.844 --> 35:15.247
"Go on, hit her!
Hit her, do it!

35:15.281 --> 35:17.316
"She's getting away!
She's still moving!

35:17.349 --> 35:18.750
Stomp on her!
Do it! Do it!"

35:18.784 --> 35:19.751
(Judge)
Mr. Perle.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.788
Mr. Perle, control yourself.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.328
So you always do
whatever Larry says?

35:29.361 --> 35:35.334
I wish I was brave enough to
stand up to him, but I wasn't.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.370
I'm sorry.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.914
(Judge)
Do you want to continue
with this witness,

35:48.947 --> 35:52.284
Miss Novak?

35:52.318 --> 35:54.753
I do, your honor.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.455
It's late.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.923
You can resume tomorrow.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.157
This court is adjourned.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.462
I hope you've got something.
I'm getting killed here.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.298
We got a connection between
Garrett and Tauber's death

36:06.332 --> 36:07.233
on Tauber's computer.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.900
TARU found a big chunk
of encrypted code

36:08.934 --> 36:10.402
on his hard drive,

36:10.436 --> 36:12.238
sent to him two hours
before he killed himself.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.939
Who sent it?

36:13.972 --> 36:15.841
Same creep that added
the naked victim sequence

36:15.874 --> 36:17.309
to the game, Stu Davis.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.645
We're holding him
in the crime lab.

36:19.678 --> 36:24.316
Now, Stu, you sent Larry Tauber
a self-deleting email.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.417
We found it
on his computer.

36:25.451 --> 36:28.354
He opened it,
he read it once,

36:28.387 --> 36:30.222
and, poof,
it disappeared.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.290
But only as far
as his hard drive.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.659
So you're gonna
tell us what it says.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.961
Listen, all right, I've got
nothing to do with this.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.028
Yeah, you do.

36:37.062 --> 36:39.698
Because the guy you sent
the email to is now dead.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.700
Eventually he'll break
the encryption,

36:41.733 --> 36:43.335
and when he does,
I will arrest you

36:43.369 --> 36:44.636
for conspiracy to murder.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.406
Stu, start decrypting.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.411
Start!

36:54.946 --> 36:56.615
God, he said it
was just a joke.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.784
This is ridiculous, man,
I'm a programmer,

36:58.817 --> 36:59.985
not a killer.

37:00.018 --> 37:00.919
I swear to God,

37:00.952 --> 37:03.855
I never knew anyone
was gonna get hurt.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.792
(computer game voice)
You killed her, Larry.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.728
You kicked that poor woman
to death.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.597
Cops are coming for you,
Larry.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.800
You can run, Larry Tauber,

37:14.833 --> 37:17.503
but you can't hide.
[laughter]

37:19.338 --> 37:21.440
(Novak)
Lights, please.

37:24.042 --> 37:28.480
So whose face is that
on the screen?

37:28.514 --> 37:30.749
Larry Tauber's.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.718
People's exhibit 11.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.354
A check for $1,000
made out to...

37:35.387 --> 37:36.254
Stuart Davis.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.390
And whose signature
is that?

37:38.424 --> 37:40.359
Mine.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.728
You paid Mr. Davis $1,000

37:42.761 --> 37:45.797
to send that email
to Larry Tauber. Why?

37:45.831 --> 37:48.367
I don't know.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.369
You don't know?

37:51.803 --> 37:54.940
No.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.376
Larry got that email two hours
before he killed himself.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.944
Did you want to push him
over the edge?

37:58.977 --> 38:00.646
No.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.414
Then why would you send it,
huh?

38:02.448 --> 38:04.416
Did the game make you
do that too?

38:04.450 --> 38:05.951
No.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.987
Then why?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.589
It was a joke.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.924
First you say kicking
a woman to death is a game,

38:12.958 --> 38:14.493
and now this is a joke?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.094
Do you think this is funny?

38:16.127 --> 38:17.963
You're confusing me.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.931
You weren't confused.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.800
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.435
You were afraid Larry
was going to turn you in

38:23.469 --> 38:24.370
to the Police.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.105
So you preyed on him
until he killed himself.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.509
Larry Tauber, murderer.
LMAO.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.778
What does that mean, LMAO?
Why don't you tell us?

38:36.448 --> 38:37.449
Laughing my ass off.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.751
What--I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.520
Laughing my ass off.

38:41.553 --> 38:42.354
Larry's dead, Melody's dead,

38:42.388 --> 38:44.523
and you're laughing
your ass off?

38:44.556 --> 38:46.425
Yeah, you bet I am.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.459
'Cause you are a joke.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.695
This whole damn thing
is a joke.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.736
Nothing further.

39:03.509 --> 39:06.712
"Video game violence has
a horrifying potential

39:06.745 --> 39:09.515
"to promote acts of violence
against real victims

39:09.548 --> 39:15.454
and desensitize children
to the real thing."

39:15.487 --> 39:17.456
That's what the American
Medical Association

39:17.489 --> 39:21.727
had to say in their testimony
to Congress.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.530
Now, does
the games industry care?

39:24.563 --> 39:27.666
Listen to them describe
their latest hit.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.034
"You can still beat up
the hookers

39:29.067 --> 39:30.902
"and steal their money.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.804
"You can run over cops
and shoot and kill

39:32.838 --> 39:34.172
"the ambulance drivers

39:34.205 --> 39:37.175
as they come in
to pick up the dead."

39:37.208 --> 39:39.411
Now, you take that attitude
and that product

39:39.445 --> 39:41.547
and you put it in the hands
of a young man

39:41.580 --> 39:44.816
who has a history of addictive
and risk-taking behavior,

39:44.850 --> 39:47.185
and you are going to create
a tragedy.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.588
And that is what
happened here.

39:49.621 --> 39:53.459
The game NtenCity
transported two teenagers

39:53.492 --> 39:55.527
to a fantasy land.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.463
It made them high.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.566
It fed them a vile idea,

40:00.599 --> 40:04.770
and then it taught them
how to execute it.

40:04.803 --> 40:08.840
They were not in control
of their actions.

40:08.874 --> 40:12.844
And, therefore,
they're not guilty.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.952
Did Garrett and Louise
get the idea from a game?

40:20.986 --> 40:23.221
Yes.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.190
But we get ideas
all the time.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.860
From books, from TV,
from friends.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.663
From life, from everywhere.

40:31.697 --> 40:34.165
We don't act on them.

40:34.199 --> 40:39.471
We know that the idea
doesn't justify the deed.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.540
Don't let Mr. Gates
blind you to the facts.

40:41.573 --> 40:45.076
Real people ran over
a real person.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.112
And then they
beat her to death.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.648
Melody Quinn felt real pain.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.917
She bled real blood.

40:51.950 --> 40:55.186
And she died a horrible
and lonely death.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.888
It was not a game.

40:56.922 --> 41:00.592
Now, did Melody's killers

41:00.626 --> 41:01.426
know what they
were doing?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.161
Well, their taunting
of Larry Tauber,

41:03.194 --> 41:05.130
the one member of their trio
with the humanity

41:05.163 --> 41:06.131
to feel regret,

41:06.164 --> 41:08.600
proves that they did.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.602
Garret Perle said it himself,
it was a joke.

41:10.636 --> 41:11.603
Well, you know what?

41:11.637 --> 41:15.240
Murder is no joke.

41:15.273 --> 41:18.510
So don't let them
use a game as an excuse

41:18.544 --> 41:23.014
for their cruel
and callous actions.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.260
As to the defendant
Garret Perle,

41:35.293 --> 41:36.695
the charge of murder
in the second degree,

41:36.728 --> 41:37.829
how do you find?

41:40.632 --> 41:42.100
We find the defendant guilty.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.738
As to the defendant
Louise Karnaki on the charge

41:46.772 --> 41:47.606
of murder
in the second degree,

41:47.639 --> 41:48.707
how do you find?

41:50.008 --> 41:51.743
We find the defendant guilty.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.913
Defendants are remanded
until sentencing.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.615
This court is adjourned.

41:56.648 --> 41:57.749
[bangs gavel]

41:57.783 --> 41:58.917
Aw, shut up.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.789
Bang bang,
you're dead.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.557
(judge)
Get him out of here.

42:09.795 --> 42:12.964
Game's over.
You won.

42:19.337 --> 42:23.141
We won the case today.

42:23.174 --> 42:24.142
Two guilty verdicts.

42:24.175 --> 42:27.613
That's good.

42:27.646 --> 42:28.647
What are you playing?

42:28.680 --> 42:29.948
Hockey.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.850
Got him.
What a hit!

42:31.883 --> 42:34.119
Do you have to play that
all the time?

42:34.152 --> 42:35.153
Why not?

42:35.186 --> 42:36.421
I like it.

42:36.454 --> 42:40.792
I know, but maybe we can play
something together, you know?

42:42.694 --> 42:43.895
Like what?

42:43.929 --> 42:46.264
I don't know, um...

42:46.297 --> 42:49.067
cards, Scrabble?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.106
Or maybe we can just talk.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.846
Okay. Talk.
