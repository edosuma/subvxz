WEBVTT

00:07.326 --> 00:10.523
And that's your message? My God.

00:11.931 --> 00:13.728
Who...? Who's there? What do you want?

00:13.899 --> 00:17.926
Because all you're gonna get is holes.
I... I mean, holes in you...

00:18.103 --> 00:21.698
not my... Hah! Sterling?

00:21.874 --> 00:24.775
- Hello, Mother.
- Where the hell have you been?

00:24.944 --> 00:28.778
- I don't know.
- What...? And why do you have a cleaver?

00:34.186 --> 00:36.586
"Interoffice fraternization
of an intimate nature...

00:36.755 --> 00:39.019
is prohibited to include
but not limited to...

00:39.191 --> 00:42.183
trysts, assignations..."
What's this even mean?

00:42.361 --> 00:44.352
It means no more banging coworkers.

00:44.530 --> 00:46.191
Oh, so it doesn't affect you.

00:46.365 --> 00:48.196
Mee-hee. Oh, wait, guess what.

00:48.367 --> 00:50.733
Ow! Hey, this isn't my fault.

00:50.903 --> 00:54.361
It's exactly your fault, idiot. When
Mother found out you cheated on Lana...

00:54.540 --> 00:58.032
- Hey, you cheated on Lana plenty.
- Yeah, but with starlets, models.

00:58.210 --> 01:00.371
Oh, and one time, two actual princesses.

01:00.546 --> 01:02.411
- Two at the same time?
- Yeah, they were sisters.

01:02.581 --> 01:05.641
- Sploosh.
- Cyril, you threw Lana away on chicks like...

01:05.818 --> 01:07.479
- Like Carol.
- It's Cheryl.

01:07.653 --> 01:10.121
- Exactly, back me up here.
- You slept with her too.

01:10.289 --> 01:14.419
When I was bored. Like, stuck at home
waiting for the cable guy, or... Oh, hey.

01:14.593 --> 01:16.720
What are you doing Thursday
between 9 and noon?

01:16.895 --> 01:17.987
- Ugh.
- One and 4?

01:18.163 --> 01:20.222
I'll be doing one of your co-workers.

01:20.399 --> 01:22.560
Well, do it before quitting time Friday.

01:22.735 --> 01:25.260
- Why'd Ms. Archer give us until Friday...?
- I did that.

01:25.437 --> 01:28.031
Somebody in this building
is gonna have sex with me.

01:28.207 --> 01:30.175
Yeah? You think
between now and Friday...

01:30.342 --> 01:32.242
you can score some roofies?
- Heh-heh-heh.

01:32.411 --> 01:36.040
Uh-uh. Pam? I will end you.

01:36.415 --> 01:37.712
Ow!

01:38.584 --> 01:40.552
Where the hell is my staple gun?

01:40.719 --> 01:42.016
I think I saw Cyril with it.

01:42.187 --> 01:45.213
- He went through my desk?
- I guess. I mean he said he did.

01:45.391 --> 01:48.519
I don't know why I'm surprised.
I mean, can you believe him?

01:48.694 --> 01:50.355
- Cheating on Lana?
- Baffling.

01:50.529 --> 01:53.862
Said the kettle. Which is why
I started that new policy.

01:54.033 --> 01:55.796
- Yeah?
- You idiots run around here...

01:55.968 --> 01:58.402
like it's spring break on South Padre.

01:58.570 --> 02:02.631
<i>- Just sex, sex, sex...
- Sexy-sexy, eh?</i>

02:02.808 --> 02:05.402
<i>Nikolai?
- Is from Frederick's of Latvia.</i>

02:05.577 --> 02:07.477
<i>- Mother? What?
- Oh, hello, son.</i>

02:07.646 --> 02:09.341
- Nikolai.
- Why did he call me "son?"

02:09.514 --> 02:11.483
- What is this?
- You mean...

02:11.717 --> 02:14.652
besides incredibly awkward?

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.252 --> 02:51.279
No, I think "incredibly awkward"
just about sums it up.

02:51.457 --> 02:52.947
What? Mother!

02:53.125 --> 02:55.457
Nikolai, could I call you back?

02:55.627 --> 02:58.289
<i>I will be here maybe in one hour...</i>

02:58.464 --> 03:01.865
<i>...then I'll try to hit gym, so...
- The gym. That'll be the day.</i>

03:02.034 --> 03:03.661
Are you out of your mind?

03:03.836 --> 03:06.396
I must be. Because it looks
like you just destroyed...

03:06.572 --> 03:08.199
my Steuben bar set.

03:08.374 --> 03:12.777
- Well, you just destroyed my innocence.
- Oh, please, that Brazilian au pair...

03:12.945 --> 03:16.403
did that when you were 13.
- 12. And why does Nikolai Jakov...

03:16.582 --> 03:19.642
the head of the KGB,
have a direct line to your office?

03:19.818 --> 03:22.446
Well, you know, from time to time...
What...? No.

03:22.621 --> 03:24.851
Just leave that,
you'll cut yourself. Sterling.

03:25.023 --> 03:28.618
And a follow-up question:
Why did he just call me son?

03:28.794 --> 03:31.957
- That's often a figure of speech.
- Yeah? How often?

03:32.131 --> 03:35.294
Very often. Just not in this case.

03:35.467 --> 03:36.934
I know... Uh...

03:37.102 --> 03:38.899
What?

03:40.606 --> 03:44.565
Terrific. Two Steuben
glasses left and you break one.

03:44.743 --> 03:46.973
I'm sorry, Krieger, but it's over.

03:47.146 --> 03:50.013
So here's all your Creedence
Clearwater albums back.

03:50.182 --> 03:53.049
- Now a sad moon is on the rise.
- I know, devastating.

03:53.218 --> 03:55.482
But it's not you,
it's your weak, womanny hands.

03:55.654 --> 03:57.918
- They're not...
- It's like being choked by a child.

03:58.090 --> 04:00.024
Which I thought would be hot, but...

04:00.192 --> 04:03.286
- Wait, no, I'll take steroids.
- I can't wait. I need a man now...

04:03.462 --> 04:07.091
with monster-hands.
- Oh, like Lana ha... Hey, you.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.257
You know, the whole
"monster-hands" thing?

04:09.435 --> 04:11.528
Starting to border on mean.

04:11.703 --> 04:14.866
Oh, you gonna run cry to Ms. Archer,
like when Cyril cheated on you?

04:15.374 --> 04:17.000
- Hello.
- Ooh-la-la.

04:17.176 --> 04:21.010
Well, at least my ex-boyfriend isn't
a noose I made out of extension cord.

04:21.180 --> 04:23.740
Guess what. She wasn't
the only one Cyril cheated with.

04:25.117 --> 04:28.348
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- Figure it out, Truckasaurus.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.351
Oh, that gives me an idea.

04:30.522 --> 04:34.253
But I already have a father.
His name was John Fitzgerald Archer.

04:34.426 --> 04:36.621
He was a fighter ace,
and he won the Navy Cross.

04:36.795 --> 04:38.922
- And his men called him...
- "Black Jack" Archer.

04:39.097 --> 04:41.759
I know, dear, I know,
because I made it all up.

04:41.934 --> 04:43.458
But the military funeral.

04:43.635 --> 04:47.071
Ready. Aim.
Oh, my God.

04:47.239 --> 04:50.606
- Lf we miss that train I will go blind.
Fire.

04:52.377 --> 04:53.969
But the 21 gun salute.

04:54.146 --> 04:58.480
I donated 600 bucks
to a Junior ROTC team up in Yonkers.

04:58.650 --> 05:01.448
Which they used to go
to a competition in Albany...

05:01.620 --> 05:05.488
where they won third place.
So a lot of good came out of that.

05:05.657 --> 05:07.921
- So all's well that ends well?
- What was I to do?

05:08.093 --> 05:10.755
Tell a 3-year-old
his father might be in the KGB?

05:10.929 --> 05:12.487
What? What do you mean might be?

05:12.664 --> 05:16.327
So there may or may not be
a few other possibles...

05:16.502 --> 05:18.402
in the mix.

05:18.837 --> 05:20.099
What?

05:20.272 --> 05:22.433
Seriously? You cheated on me with Carol?

05:22.608 --> 05:24.576
- Cheryl.
- Exactly.

05:24.743 --> 05:27.371
- And I can explain that.
- Well if you'd let me.

05:27.546 --> 05:30.379
Yeah, tell me.
How my father might be Nikolai Jakov...

05:30.549 --> 05:34.246
head of the KGB
or Len Trexler, head of ODIN!

05:34.419 --> 05:37.388
- Well...
- I assume those are my only choices?

05:38.957 --> 05:40.549
Oh, my... Who else?

05:40.726 --> 05:43.320
- Gene Krupa. No, wait.
- What? The drummer?

05:43.495 --> 05:45.429
Not Krupa, the other one, with the teeth.

05:46.999 --> 05:48.330
- Buddy Rich.
- Oh, my...

05:48.500 --> 05:52.561
- I could never say no to a drummer.
- Could you say no to anybody?

05:52.838 --> 05:55.864
I said no to plenty.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.100
- No. No.
- Yes. Have sex with me. Please.

05:58.277 --> 06:00.507
- No.
- Oh, come on.

06:00.679 --> 06:04.308
- Nobody would ever know.
- Pam? Yeah.

06:04.483 --> 06:05.780
- I'd know.
No.

06:05.951 --> 06:08.419
<i>- Let me talk to him.
- No. No.</i>

06:08.587 --> 06:12.455
Nikolai, he's not even here.
He stormed out, thanks to you.

06:12.624 --> 06:16.458
<i>But I could talk sense into him.
After all, I am his father.</i>

06:16.628 --> 06:18.653
Oh. So...

06:20.032 --> 06:23.024
Len Trexler or Buddy Rich?

06:23.201 --> 06:26.466
- Get me that crazy German. Now.
- Ow! Ow!

06:26.638 --> 06:28.469
- Hostile work environment.
- Shut up.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.131
We are going to kidnap
Agent Sterling Archer.

06:31.310 --> 06:33.710
Oh, yeah? Then what,
you hurt his feelings?

06:33.879 --> 06:37.474
Then we put new mind-control
microchip into his brain.

06:37.649 --> 06:40.209
We use its remote-control capability...

06:40.385 --> 06:43.877
to bring him here, make the papa test.

06:44.056 --> 06:46.081
And if I am Archer's father...

06:46.258 --> 06:49.716
I turn him against his own mother,
as Soviet agent.

06:49.895 --> 06:52.921
Make him a, how you say, vole.

06:53.732 --> 06:56.496
- I think you mean mole. Mole.
- Huh?

06:56.668 --> 07:01.298
Vole is also rodent,
but more closer related to lemming.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.509
Come on, buddy.

07:17.255 --> 07:20.452
Can't you read, ass-douche? You're not
supposed to be here without a kid.

07:20.626 --> 07:23.151
As it happens, I am here with a child.

07:23.328 --> 07:25.353
Mani, can we have
more money for the sweets?

07:25.530 --> 07:28.260
What? That's not even a real baby.

07:28.433 --> 07:32.631
And that is? I thought you were
off to the fair with your prize turnip.

07:34.006 --> 07:36.270
- A tur...? Listen, you kraut puke.
- Hello.

07:36.441 --> 07:38.841
Oh, yeah. You should go.

07:39.011 --> 07:40.945
You're lucky his father's not here.

07:41.113 --> 07:44.207
He knows krav maga,
he'll kick your balls through your hat...

07:44.383 --> 07:47.318
you Nazi shit ass.
- Mani, these people.

07:47.486 --> 07:50.922
Well, you wanted him to grow
up in the city.

07:51.089 --> 07:53.649
<i>Nein, major, not you. Yeah, listening.</i>

07:53.825 --> 07:56.020
And after you take Archer to the...

07:57.396 --> 07:59.261
KGB safehouse on Gansevoort...

07:59.431 --> 08:01.092
you will implant the microchip...

08:01.266 --> 08:02.756
<i>into his brain.
- Got it.</i>

08:03.802 --> 08:08.364
Yeah, seriously.
Okay, Uta, we have a job, so...

08:08.540 --> 08:10.872
Where is the diaper bag?

08:11.710 --> 08:15.441
- I forgot where I put it.
- Huge surprise.

08:15.614 --> 08:18.014
- Ow! Ow!
- Idiot. What is wrong with you?

08:18.183 --> 08:19.309
<i>And just who the happy hell...</i>

08:19.484 --> 08:21.918
<i>... do you think you are,
hanging up on me?</i>

08:22.087 --> 08:25.147
Oh, you gonna tell
your boyfriend, Len Trexler?

08:25.323 --> 08:27.917
- Or maybe Gene Krupa?
- It was the other one.

08:28.093 --> 08:30.323
Maybe. Or you, maybe, or...

08:30.495 --> 08:34.556
Whoever it was, he wasn't there to raise
Sterling, so I don't need him butting in now.

08:34.732 --> 08:36.325
<i>- We'll see. Nothing.
- What?</i>

08:36.501 --> 08:38.491
Nikolai, what are you scheming at?

08:38.669 --> 08:42.128
<i>- Nothing.
- Again he hangs up on me.</i>

08:45.210 --> 08:48.111
And there goes the last Steuben.

08:51.883 --> 08:55.375
- Sploosh. That's what I'm talking about.
- Yup, yup, yup.

08:55.987 --> 08:58.649
Wait, you think it's safe?

08:59.958 --> 09:01.482
No.

09:01.660 --> 09:04.686
Okay, we got the French chick,
and Carol...

09:04.863 --> 09:06.888
and anybody else, Rambone?
- No.

09:07.065 --> 09:08.555
Hi, Cyril.

09:11.503 --> 09:14.028
- Well. Um...
- Scatterbrain Jane? Really?

09:14.206 --> 09:16.970
Well, say she had just been
diagnosed with breast cancer.

09:17.142 --> 09:20.976
Oh, right. I forgot,
your dick's full of radiation...

09:21.146 --> 09:22.977
and mastectomy coupons.

09:23.148 --> 09:26.311
Boy, you are just so determined
not to be cool about this.

09:26.485 --> 09:28.953
- Yup. Anybody else?
- Um...

09:29.855 --> 09:32.187
Ms. Archer, you're trying to seduce me.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.191
Aren't you?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.555
- Nope, no, no one.
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:37.729 --> 09:39.822
- Okay, get out.
- Of my own office?

09:39.998 --> 09:41.260
- Yup.
- Why?

09:41.433 --> 09:43.594
Oh, you don't wanna be here...

09:43.769 --> 09:46.033
when I bang every last dude
in the building.

09:46.204 --> 09:47.728
- What?
- Here on your blotter.

09:47.906 --> 09:48.930
- No!
- Yup!

09:49.107 --> 09:52.235
- You can't do that.
- Really? Is it Opposite Day already?

09:53.612 --> 09:57.013
Uh... Attention? Hi, this is Agent Kane...

09:57.182 --> 10:00.515
<i>... and if you wanna have
ball-slappy sex with me on Cyril's desk...</i>

10:00.685 --> 10:03.017
please line up and take a number.

10:04.523 --> 10:07.515
You heard the lady. Take a number.

10:08.894 --> 10:12.830
Eighty-sixed? Uh-uh.
You don't eighty-six me.

10:12.998 --> 10:16.456
Because my dad won the Navy Cross.

10:19.171 --> 10:22.629
- Here's the door.
- Help. Please help me.

10:22.808 --> 10:25.572
My baby. He swallowed something,
he's choking.

10:27.279 --> 10:29.747
Oh, who gives a shit about a baby?

10:31.149 --> 10:34.380
Who would want to raise a child here?

10:35.587 --> 10:39.751
- Well, that was a huge waste of time.
- I said don't take your clothes off.

10:39.925 --> 10:42.917
- Well. Well!
- Begged, even. Okay, this is good to go.

10:43.094 --> 10:45.756
- So was this.
- So let's get number two in here.

10:45.931 --> 10:49.094
- You really think this is gonna work?
- Pam, look at me.

10:49.267 --> 10:51.565
Yeah... Sploosh.

10:52.938 --> 10:55.600
<i>Now serving number two.
I'm two.</i>

10:56.441 --> 10:58.841
- That's me! Move, dude.
- Animals.

10:59.010 --> 11:02.969
- You're all just animals.
- Lying in wait at the watering hole...

11:03.148 --> 11:06.174
taut buttocks all aquiver,
just aching to pounce...

11:06.351 --> 11:08.615
on the supple brown flesh
of your woman.

11:08.787 --> 11:10.448
- Shut up.
- They're gonna mess her up.

11:10.622 --> 11:12.146
- Why are you even here?
- Hello.

11:12.324 --> 11:15.987
- But you're gay.
- Girl, please. Nobody's that gay.

11:16.161 --> 11:17.992
- Wait, what?
- What, what?

11:18.163 --> 11:20.495
What part of you pay me 600 dollars
do you not get?

11:20.665 --> 11:23.156
The part where we don't have sex?

11:23.335 --> 11:24.825
You get to say we did.

11:25.003 --> 11:27.233
Which is, like,
half the reason men have sex.

11:27.405 --> 11:28.895
But that's a lot of money.

11:29.074 --> 11:31.338
- Not compared to rotator cuff surgery.
- What?

11:31.509 --> 11:34.034
Which you're gonna need
after the jillion high-fives...

11:34.212 --> 11:36.180
you give your little bros.

11:37.015 --> 11:39.210
- Okay, I'm in.
- But first guy you tell is Cyril.

11:39.384 --> 11:42.353
- And make up the sickest...
- Yeah, shut up, do you take plastic?

11:42.520 --> 11:45.751
- Five percent discount for cash.
- I thought it was ten.

11:45.924 --> 11:48.791
Oh, oh, oh, I can't wet my beak?

11:50.762 --> 11:53.424
Hey, seriously, kidnappers...

11:53.598 --> 11:55.793
super not in the mood for this right now.

11:57.435 --> 11:58.925
Or that. What is that?

11:59.738 --> 12:00.932
Is that a drill?

12:01.106 --> 12:02.835
- Okay, so.
I don't want that.

12:03.008 --> 12:06.375
<i>- I make a klein hole in his skull with this.
Just shut that off.</i>

12:06.544 --> 12:09.741
- Then into the hole I smoosh this.
What is that?

12:09.915 --> 12:11.940
And then they can control his brain.

12:12.784 --> 12:14.649
But is Soviet technology...

12:14.819 --> 12:17.549
so it's a crapshoot.
- This is amazing, no?

12:17.722 --> 12:20.589
What is amazing is we just
ran into him on the street.

12:20.759 --> 12:23.728
- It's a huge city.
- Hey. Hey! Proposition.

12:23.895 --> 12:26.159
First person to untie me, guy or gal...

12:26.331 --> 12:29.994
I will let him or her give me a handy.
Ugh.

12:30.168 --> 12:33.934
- Let's share the milk of human kindness.
- What an asshole.

12:34.105 --> 12:38.337
- Don't worry, your time is coming.
- Wait, by time do you mean me?

12:38.510 --> 12:41.479
And by "don't worry", do you mean
the chick's gonna be doing the handy?

12:42.981 --> 12:45.347
And either way,
can we do it without that thing?

12:45.517 --> 12:46.779
Hey, seriously.

12:47.652 --> 12:49.882
Give me a hanjo.

12:59.864 --> 13:01.923
<i>It doesn't work.</i>

13:02.100 --> 13:06.434
I drill hole in head of man
who maybe is my son.

13:06.604 --> 13:09.573
Put chip in his brain...

13:09.741 --> 13:13.700
and now you tell me it doesn't work.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.005
You should have asked me before, you...

13:16.181 --> 13:18.809
See, in testing we have
had teensy problem...

13:18.984 --> 13:20.975
with signal from satellite.

13:21.152 --> 13:24.815
When it is in small
window just over the target...

13:24.990 --> 13:26.617
it can signal the chip.

13:29.461 --> 13:31.452
But when it exits this window.

13:31.997 --> 13:35.455
- Ahh.
- This problem does not sound teensy!

13:35.633 --> 13:38.397
It is compared to the problem we had...

13:38.570 --> 13:40.595
with interference from cell phones.

13:44.576 --> 13:49.479
Which in lab sent test subjects
into ferocious homicidal rages.

13:49.647 --> 13:52.343
So obviously we need to tweak it.

13:52.884 --> 13:55.250
Damn that crazy, jealous Russian.

13:55.420 --> 13:58.878
Bet he's hatching some half-assed,
vodka-soaked scheme to...

13:59.057 --> 14:02.424
<i>Hello? Ha!
- Sterling? Sterling, listen very... Wha...?</i>

14:02.594 --> 14:04.687
<i>Voicemail. You know what to do.</i>

14:04.863 --> 14:06.660
<i>We're sorry.
- Damn it.</i>

14:06.831 --> 14:08.992
Carol? Carol.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.101
And just where the hell is she?

14:15.006 --> 14:18.806
- Oh, God, sorry. Sorry.
- Ahh...

14:18.977 --> 14:22.174
- What are you doing?
- I thought you said start slacking off.

14:22.347 --> 14:25.248
Not slacking off.

14:25.950 --> 14:28.441
Dude, swear to God.
She gave me a Jane Hathaway.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.249
Right on my chest. My man
knows what I'm talking about.

14:32.424 --> 14:35.359
Doesn't anyone work around here?
And Cyril...

14:35.527 --> 14:39.725
I am so disgusted with you right now
I just wanna vomit.

14:41.199 --> 14:42.894
That's exactly what I said to Lana.

14:46.638 --> 14:48.697
<i>Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.</i>

14:48.873 --> 14:49.931
Ooh.

14:52.143 --> 14:54.043
- Uh... Move.
Ugh.

14:55.613 --> 14:57.012
Just get it done by Friday.

15:15.433 --> 15:18.925
Oh, come on Sterling, pick up, pick...

15:19.104 --> 15:21.504
Sterling? Sterling?
What's wrong, are you in...?

15:21.673 --> 15:24.608
<i>Ha. Alternate voicemail.</i>

15:24.843 --> 15:27.311
<i>- You know what to do, stupid.
We're sorry...</i>

15:27.479 --> 15:30.107
I'm done. He's dead to me.

15:30.915 --> 15:31.939
Mother.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.553
Kill Mother.

15:41.726 --> 15:43.921
Oh, my God, I'm exhausted.

15:44.095 --> 15:46.029
Whereas I am merely confused.

15:46.197 --> 15:48.427
If you told every guy the same thing...

15:48.600 --> 15:51.592
then they all know that none
of them had sex with you.

15:51.769 --> 15:54.761
- They're all gonna realize they're all lying.
- Hey, yeah.

15:54.939 --> 15:58.705
- Wait a minute.
- But remember, they're dudes.

15:58.877 --> 16:00.504
- What?
- Um...

16:00.678 --> 16:03.272
- I had sex with Lana.
- Me too.

16:03.448 --> 16:06.713
- Lana Kane, you magnificent bastard.
- Mwah.

16:06.885 --> 16:10.685
- I just hope Cyril don't, like, snap.
- Cyril? Snap?

16:10.855 --> 16:12.948
- Snap.
- Girl, please.

16:13.925 --> 16:17.486
Seven, six, two, millimeter...

16:17.662 --> 16:19.653
full metal jacket...

16:21.032 --> 16:22.329
Someone's in here.

16:22.834 --> 16:25.928
Holy shit snacks.
You made over 20 grand.

16:26.104 --> 16:27.366
Minus my sixty bucks.

16:27.539 --> 16:30.007
Plus Cyril's broken heart.
Not too shabs, Pam.

16:30.175 --> 16:32.769
Are you kidding? 36 guys?

16:32.944 --> 16:34.935
<i>It's like Schindler's List up in here.</i>

16:35.313 --> 16:37.474
- Pam!
- And I'm like that little Gandhi dude.

16:37.649 --> 16:39.514
- Pam.
- Helping out with the books, and...

16:39.684 --> 16:43.950
Inappropriate analogies?
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:44.122 --> 16:47.683
Nothing. I'm a desirable...

16:47.859 --> 16:51.625
full-bodied woman
but nobody will have sex with me.

16:51.796 --> 16:55.357
And I have so much love to give.

16:58.203 --> 17:00.296
- Get on the desk.
- Really?

17:00.471 --> 17:02.530
Yeah, come on. Before I change my mind.

17:02.707 --> 17:06.700
- But you cannot say a word.
- I won't tell anybody.

17:06.877 --> 17:08.345
No, honey, I mean during.

17:08.512 --> 17:10.981
Cause I'm gonna pretend
you're Alex Karras.

17:17.188 --> 17:20.555
And that's your message?
My God, who...?

17:21.925 --> 17:23.154
Who's there? What do you want?

17:23.328 --> 17:27.355
Because all you're gonna get
is holes. L... I mean holes in you...

17:27.531 --> 17:28.556
not my... Hah!

17:29.934 --> 17:32.368
- Sterling?
- Hello, Mother.

17:32.537 --> 17:34.198
Where the hell have you been?

17:34.372 --> 17:37.830
- I don't know.
- And why do you have a cleaver?

17:40.545 --> 17:44.413
- I don't know.
- Well, you're safe now. So get out.

17:44.582 --> 17:47.346
- I'm hungry.
- So lick that coat. You smell like a...

17:47.518 --> 17:49.509
- Grilled cheese.
- What?

17:49.687 --> 17:52.850
- Grill me a cheese.
- I'm not grilling you a cheese.

17:56.928 --> 17:59.089
Oh, for God's sake.

18:00.031 --> 18:03.592
Waltz in here,
dressed like some sort of cattle-rapist.

18:03.768 --> 18:06.464
Waving a cleaver and reeking
of what I hope to God is meat.

18:06.638 --> 18:08.162
And that's all you have to say?

18:08.339 --> 18:11.274
- I don't know.
- I was worried sick. Called you twice...

18:11.442 --> 18:13.000
came this close to leaving...

18:13.177 --> 18:17.204
And why doesn't your voicemail just say,
"Leave a message, I'm a jackass"?

18:17.382 --> 18:19.543
- I don't know.
- I don't know. I don't know.

18:19.717 --> 18:21.048
What is wrong with you?

18:21.219 --> 18:23.449
My head hurts. And I have no father.

18:23.621 --> 18:25.953
Sterling, of course you have a father.

18:26.124 --> 18:28.490
- Just maybe not the one you wanted.
- And you...

18:28.660 --> 18:31.288
And me neither. Because even though
that whole weekend...

18:31.462 --> 18:35.125
is just a big jazzy blur,
I'm pretty sure it wasn't Buddy.

18:35.300 --> 18:39.703
- And all these years, you lied to me.
- Sterling, I was protecting you.

18:39.871 --> 18:41.566
From what, this sandwich?

18:41.739 --> 18:45.140
- This is Swiss, Mother!
- Because that's all I had. You ass.

18:45.310 --> 18:49.007
- Just like I'm all that you have.
- Well, I hate it. And I hate you.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.978
Sterling Malory Archer, you will eat...

18:52.150 --> 18:56.177
every last crumb of that sandwich.

18:56.688 --> 18:59.486
- No.
- Then get out. I'll call you a cab.

19:01.159 --> 19:02.592
Sterling, stop that this instant.

19:04.329 --> 19:06.490
- Kill Mother.
- Waah!

19:06.664 --> 19:08.564
Ah. Kill Mother.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.233
Police, police, have to call the...
Waah!

19:12.403 --> 19:17.602
Déja vu, huh? I'm having a nightmare
and you lock me out of your bedroom?

19:17.775 --> 19:21.336
- Sterling, no, stay back.
- Only this time, you'll be crying for help.

19:21.512 --> 19:23.480
- Sterling!
- And I'll be the one drinking...

19:23.648 --> 19:27.675
and laughing in there with Uncle Buddy!
- Sterling, I'm warning you.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.948
Sterling!

19:34.692 --> 19:35.954
Sterling?

19:36.594 --> 19:39.119
Sterling. Sterling!

19:39.297 --> 19:41.458
What? God.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.661
Well, whose fault is that?
Waving a cleaver, screaming in Russian?

19:46.838 --> 19:47.896
- I'm sorry.
- Ass.

19:48.072 --> 19:50.506
Seriously, I don't know
what's going on with my head.

19:50.675 --> 19:54.111
Filthy coat, can't tell what's
cow's blood and what's yours.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.178
The wet blood, Mother, is mine.

19:56.347 --> 19:58.440
- And it's ruining my brand-new linens.
- Sorry.

19:58.616 --> 20:02.017
- This is why I can't have nice things.
- Why, because you shoot them?

20:02.186 --> 20:04.677
Serves you right.
You nearly scared me to death.

20:04.856 --> 20:07.882
Well, you obviously weren't
that scared, judging by your grouping.

20:08.059 --> 20:10.789
- Uhn.
- Hah. Guess the old gal's still got it.

20:10.962 --> 20:14.295
- All six, right in the ten ring.
- Hooray.

20:14.465 --> 20:17.127
Just like I taught you.
Without any help from...

20:17.301 --> 20:20.532
whoever your father is.
- Yeah, you were always there for me.

20:20.705 --> 20:24.607
- Which I never really thank you for.
- Sterling, I don't need thanks.

20:24.776 --> 20:27.472
That's what makes me
such a wonderful mother.

20:27.645 --> 20:30.045
- Ha-ha. Are you kidding?
- Don't be shitty.

20:30.214 --> 20:33.775
- Can't we just enjoy the moment?
- Yeah, how could we not?

20:36.421 --> 20:37.581
Ass.
