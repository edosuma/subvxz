That's all
you're going to get.

Anything happens
to those kids,
it's on you.

Ethan Kelly has $15,000,000
of my money.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.786
Of your money.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.554
Some guy just broke
into Oaks' house.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.425
-ETHAN: Oaks has a pool guy
coming twice a week.
-So?

00:24.458 --> 00:26.727
Either he's the worst pool guy
in all the Bay Area

00:26.760 --> 00:28.196
or he wasn't going there
to clean it.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.497
Put your hands behind
your back.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.067
Or arrest me
and blow your opportunity
to nail Oaks to the wall.

arrest for battery.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.411
(TIRES SCREECHING)

00:44.245 --> 00:47.481
You let Maria die in a pool
of her own piss and blood

00:47.515 --> 00:49.817
and you fucking
abandoned her!

00:49.850 --> 00:53.387
You can help this girl.
Tell me where she is!

00:53.421 --> 00:55.856
CLEA: The captors
cut their hands open.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.359
Inside,
there was a small chip.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.828
The girls were told
it was some sort
of tracking device.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.298
She's saying they didn't put
the chip in her hand.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.599
They put it in her head.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.570
And it's still
fucking in there.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

02:14.868 --> 02:16.304
You good?

02:16.870 --> 02:19.440
I did it,
if that's what you mean.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.883
Sadie, we got to get
out of here. Now!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.544
(FLAMES CRACKLING)

03:07.421 --> 03:09.923
That's it? Not much of a scar.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.493
I spoke to the other girls.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.027
They said that the chip
is tiny.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.565
And the traffickers,
they use some sort of gizmo
to implant it in their hands.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.768
SLEADER: And this girl's
the only one to have it
in her head.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.436
CLEA: As far as we know.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.805
I'm thinking,
we get the chip.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.808
We find out exactly
what it is, who made it.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.743
Maybe we figure out
what we're dealing with here.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.380
Maybe it leads us
to the traffickers.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.616
-Maybe.
-It's the best lead
we have so far, Captain.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.386
Where are we at
with St. Margaret's?

03:38.419 --> 03:40.754
We're still waiting
on the surgery slot.

(SIGHS)
It's a whole new world.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.932
Who is that?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.503
Fuck if I know.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.939
-Excuse me?
-Hi.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.574
Uh... Kathryn Farese.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.711
Phan's court-appointed lawyer.
Saw her sitting here.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.346
All alone.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.715
A police station
is a scary place, Sergeant.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.351
Captain. Frank Sleader.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.355
This is Detective Clea Annou.
She's the one who found Phan.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.556
We're arranging for a surgeon.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.491
A surgeon? What for?

04:17.525 --> 04:18.692
You don't know?

04:18.726 --> 04:21.028
The court clerk just said that
a minor was in police custody.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.433
Maybe we should talk
in my office.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.568
KATHRYN: Wait a minute,
this chip is in her head?

04:27.801 --> 04:30.471
The MRI shows it was implanted
in her brain.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.406
KATHRYN: Oh, my God. Why?

04:32.906 --> 04:33.941
We have no idea.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.544
The other trafficked girls
have them in their hands.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.379
They were told the chip
was a tracking device,

04:38.412 --> 04:40.047
keep tabs on them,
make sure they couldn't run.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.982
I assume you're testing
these other chips.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.452
The chips were cut out
before we found the girls.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.919
That's why we contacted
St. Margaret's.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.491
Well, I'm going to need
an opinion on this.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.992
What do you mean?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.795
A doctor cutting
into her brain?

04:54.828 --> 04:57.097
We're going to use the best
doctor that we can find.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.599
We want the best
for that girl.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.634
Still, I...
I need a second opinion.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.605
Look, right now that chip
may be the only way
of finding out

05:04.638 --> 05:05.673
who these traffickers are.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.408
It could lead us
to other girls.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.443
And I appreciate that.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.745
But my client
has privacy rights.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.581
Like everybody else
on American soil.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.718
We appreciate you have her
best interests at heart,

05:17.751 --> 05:19.920
but surely we can work
together here.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.390
I'm sorry, I don't know
if I can allow it.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.626
-We can get a warrant.
-And what's
your probable cause?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.728
This child is a victim,
not a suspect.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.063
We don't know what that chip
is doing to her.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.499
It's inhuman to keep it in.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.367
She seems to be functioning
just fine.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.703
What you mean
is you want her help
with your investigation.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.372
I care about her
just as much as you do,
Counselor.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.641
She's a minor,
she can't consent.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.843
You want to do the surgery?
Get a court order.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.712
Are you kidding me?
You're going to make us
go to court?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.914
-Clea.
-Captain.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.517

06:25.719 --> 06:27.855
In San Francisco,
when a guy does you a solid,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.724
beer is an appropriate form
of payment.

06:31.825 --> 06:35.629
In Chi-Town, if you don't call
a guy you just met,
especially if he's a cop,

06:35.663 --> 06:37.130
when your ass gets tossed
in the clink,

06:37.164 --> 06:39.032
it's considered
a fucking insult.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.934
I'll remember that
the next time I'm in Chicago.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.437
-I owe you.
-Damn straight.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.473
I'll start with a Guinness,
work my way up from that.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.840
Uh, rain check?

06:46.874 --> 06:49.409
And us Californians
get the bad rap
for being flaky?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.880
-Come on,
I'll give you a lift.
-Thanks.

Hi, I'm looking
for Alice Williams.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.666
-Alice Williams?
-Ethan?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.769
-Hey.
-What are you...

07:48.802 --> 07:51.639
-How did you...
-I stopped by the house.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.040
Why?

07:53.073 --> 07:55.609
I wanted to see the kids,
and then a neighbor said
that Alice got hurt.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.178
-Is she okay?
-She has a broken arm.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.948
A concussion. She's sleeping.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.816
-Can I see her?
-Sure.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.229
How you holding up, Donna?

08:17.030 --> 08:19.567
-I could use a decent
cup of coffee.
-Hmm.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.586
No, I wasn't with her.
I was at work.

(SIGHS)

08:48.662 --> 08:50.998

Did she see anything
or say anything to you?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.566
DONNA: No, nothing.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.935
Just... This car came out
of nowhere.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.706
-Police think maybe kids...
-Hmm.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.810
(SNIFFLES) God damn it.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.545
I am not equipped for this.

09:05.913 --> 09:09.016
-Ray...
-Donna, it's all right.
She's going to be all right.

09:09.817 --> 09:10.818
Okay?

09:11.184 --> 09:13.787
It's very sweet
that you came, Ethan.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.658
-So what can I do?
-We're fine.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.928
Look, maybe I stay here,
you go home, you shower...

09:20.961 --> 09:22.930
No, I'm not going anywhere.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.298
Well, what about April?

09:26.199 --> 09:27.601
Friends are watching her.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.871
Okay, I'll tell you what,
I will get, uh,
a decent coffee for you.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.241
Ethan, seriously,
what are you doing?

09:38.045 --> 09:39.279
Oh, man.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.215
You just feel helpless
without a task, huh?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.818
Isn't that the definition
of testosterone?

09:48.255 --> 09:51.091
Guess I could use
change of clothes. (SNIFFLES)

09:51.759 --> 09:54.194
-Okay.
-Alice has a favorite blanket.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.031
-Consider it done.
-It's blue.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.668
-Her initials
are stitched in it.
-Okay.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.238
Ethan...

10:06.940 --> 10:08.175
Thank you.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.680
Of course.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.761
Wouldn't it be better
for all concerned

10:27.795 --> 10:29.730
to get this thing
out of your client's head?

10:29.763 --> 10:32.065
I have three doctors ready
to testify that the chip

10:32.099 --> 10:33.834
is causing absolutely
no damage.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.703
Lacking a compelling State
interest to remove it...

10:35.736 --> 10:38.038
Catching and convicting
the people who put it there

10:38.071 --> 10:40.140
is a compelling
State interest, Your Honor.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.208
Once the police know
who made it,

10:41.241 --> 10:43.310
we have a better chance
of catching the traffickers.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.813
Maybe save some other
young girls in captivity.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.214
And if it were your daughter?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.816
Would the public's
interest convince you

10:48.849 --> 10:51.451
to let someone
go poking around
inside her head?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.821
REGAN: I have just
as many doctors
willing to testify

10:53.854 --> 10:56.356
that surgery to remove
the chip will cause no
permanent damage.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.792
Tell Joan Rivers that.
She went in for a nip-tuck

10:58.826 --> 11:01.228
and she never came out.
Surgery is never a sure thing.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.764
What does the girl
want to do?

11:04.832 --> 11:06.233
She's a minor, Your Honor.
She can't legally consent.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.269
I'm sure she would want
the cops to catch the people
who did this to her.

11:09.469 --> 11:13.774
And I'm sure she doesn't
want to risk being turned
into a vegetable or worse.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.343
What's really going
on here, Counselor?

11:17.177 --> 11:20.047
Whatever you decide
will be precedential,
Your Honor.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.850
In other words,
Counsel doesn't give
a damn about the child.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.786
I care about every child.
And every adult.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.090
The bottom line,
this motion is about
a lot more

11:30.123 --> 11:32.793
than the particular
facts of this case,
Your Honor.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.028
This is about the government
overstepping its bounds

11:35.062 --> 11:36.930
and trampling
on the rights of its citizens.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.266
By asking them to help
in a criminal investigation?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.001
No, by compelling them to.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.936
It's called being
a good citizen.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.939
-It's called slavery.
-(SCOFFS)
A little hyperbolic, no?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.808
KATHRYN:
What would you call it?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.177
The government forcing
a citizen to do its work?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.745
Under the All Writs Act...

11:51.779 --> 11:53.313
Of 1789...

11:53.346 --> 11:55.315
...signed by
George Washington,

11:55.348 --> 11:58.251
clearly gives the court
the power to issue
such an order.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.487
Really? Ask the lawyers
at the Justice Department

12:00.520 --> 12:03.356
who tried to force
Tim Cook of Apple
to create a backdoor.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.093
The Supreme Court
never rendered an opinion
in that case.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.528
Although this is all
very interesting,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.931
the All Writs Act
is a federal statute,

12:10.964 --> 12:13.867
and as such, it delineates
the reach of federal law.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.403
There is no statute giving
State government that power.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.772
And there is no
State statute denying it.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.780
(SIGHS) You both make
very compelling arguments.

12:26.814 --> 12:30.283
And I certainly find myself
in sympathy with your cause,
Counselor.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.252
But without
statutory authority,

12:32.285 --> 12:35.055
I am loathe to violate
anyone's privacy rights.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.525
Therefore, I cannot order
the requested surgery.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.260
The State's motion is denied.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.897
-KATHRYN:
One other thing, Your Honor.
-JUDGE: What is it?

12:43.931 --> 12:46.266
The child is currently
being held in a secure unit.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.769
We feel this is detrimental
to her interests.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.272
Given everything
that she's been through,

12:52.305 --> 12:54.541
we request she be moved
to protective foster care.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.978
-Any objection?
-None, Your Honor.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.414
Submit your motion in writing.
I'll consider it.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.970
God damn it.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.804
Fucking jelly.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.408

13:31.979 --> 13:33.346
Son of a bitch.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.958
Fucking bullshit. Stick.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.410
Fucking jelly bullshit.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.915
Come on!

15:18.351 --> 15:19.919
(ENGINE STARTS)

15:27.995 --> 15:29.296
So that's it?
We can't appeal?

15:29.329 --> 15:31.564
We can appeal,
but she'll have
her driver's license

15:31.598 --> 15:34.001
by the time we get it in front
of Appellate Court.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.335
What about Federal Court?

15:35.368 --> 15:37.404
I pulled that statute
out of my ass, okay?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.040
It's not applicable,
and even if it was,

15:40.073 --> 15:42.275
it's trumped by Phan's
inalienable right to privacy.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.644
Fuck. The law is some
tricky shit.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.379
Amen to that.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.315
There is
something that we can do

15:48.348 --> 15:50.450
-but you're not going
to like it.
-What is it?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.385
We can charge Phan
with obstruction.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.121
I told you.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.723
A teenage girl gets a chip
implanted in her brain

15:56.756 --> 15:59.326
and forced to do
God-knows-what
to a bunch of sick fucks.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.429
The only thing that we can do
to get it out is threaten
to put her in jail?

16:03.030 --> 16:05.032
Tell me again
what country we live in?

16:05.498 --> 16:08.035
There's got to be a way
around this, there has to be.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.570
When you find it, let me know.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.180
Where the fuck
are you going?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.195
(PHONE RINGING)

16:41.068 --> 16:43.136
-Hello?
-And now you know
I'm not playing.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.273
I know you hate me right now
and you want to kill me,

16:46.306 --> 16:47.674
but let me remind you
of something.

16:47.707 --> 16:51.044
Anything happens to me,
my people will make sure
those kids disappear.

16:51.078 --> 16:55.182
Listen to me,
I got $800,000 in cash

16:55.482 --> 16:56.583
ready to give to you.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.750
That's not what I asked for.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.487
Look, I'm trying to sell the
fucking bar as fast as I can.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.821
All right? I just need time.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.691
I'll get you the money.
Now, I have 800 grand.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.659
You just tell me
when and where.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.634
Hello? Fucking bitch!

17:27.780 --> 17:30.217
You two motherfuckers
were supposed to be watching,
you hear me?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.252
Ethan, I'm sorry,
the car came out of nowhere.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.687
-Shut up.
It doesn't happen again.
-Yeah.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.823
Nobody gets close
to the house, yeah?

17:36.856 --> 17:38.725
Got it. Got it, Ethan.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.071
You should shower.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.807
You know, change of clothes,
it'll make you feel better.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.677
Do you remember
when you met my dad?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.780
-You want to do this now?
-Do you remember?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.349
Yeah.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.285
Your cousin's graduation.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.821
He stormed out
the second we arrived.
Homophobic prick.

18:09.656 --> 18:10.957
There was a time,

18:10.990 --> 18:14.194
before I came out
and he took down every photo
of me in the house,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.696
that I was actually
Daddy's girl.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.800
We'd go to Giants games,
me and Dad.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.571
(CHUCKLES) I was six or seven.
Total nosebleeds.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.440
Not a lot of money
in selling radon monitors.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.244
Baseball was my father's
one chance to unwind.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.713
He'd get two super dogs
with the works

18:33.746 --> 18:35.815
and if I didn't tell my mom
how many beers he drank,

18:35.848 --> 18:39.319
he'd get me one of those
big frog ice creams
on the stick.

18:39.686 --> 18:43.290
Whenever I hear the crack
of the ball on the bat,

18:46.493 --> 18:48.628
there's nothing
like that sound.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.900
I haven't heard a sound
quite like that
until yesterday,

18:56.303 --> 18:59.138
when I hit that little girl
with the car.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.843
I can't stop hearing
the thump of her body
hitting the grill.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.779
You barely knocked
her off her bike.
She's fine.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.282
You don't know that.
How do you know that?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.519
What if I killed her?
What if she's dead?

19:12.552 --> 19:14.787
If she were dead, she would be
on the local news.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.258
(SCOFFS) Jesus.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.895
(SNIFFLES)
I guess I'm just not like you.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.897
What am I like?

19:27.367 --> 19:30.237
I can't turn off the part
of my brain that...

19:30.970 --> 19:33.373
That what? Say it!

19:35.342 --> 19:38.645
That feels something, okay?
That has compassion.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.215
Like mow down
a nine-year-old girl
on a weekday afternoon

19:42.249 --> 19:43.450
like it's fucking nothing.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.485
You think that I enjoyed
myself yesterday?

19:45.518 --> 19:47.687
That I get some sick thrill
out of harming a child?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.559
Fuck you, Sadie!
I feel like shit.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.661
All right?
Just because I process
things differently,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.296
I don't drown my sorrows
in a bottle,

19:56.329 --> 19:57.897
doesn't mean that
it doesn't affect me.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.800
(GASPS)
Where does it affect you?

20:01.401 --> 20:02.602
Do not be patronizing.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.273
We're sitting on 500 K.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.941
We could be gone already.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.910
We've discussed this.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.646
500 K doesn't get us shit.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.548
We will be broke
in six months.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.888
How much is it worth
to you to traumatize
a little girl?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.296
Because I can't
do this anymore.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.836
(SIGHS)

20:40.540 --> 20:42.775
You know,
I broke my wrist once.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.413
David Bradley pushed me off
the monkey bars.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.980
(SCOFFS) Little shit.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.883
My cast was pink.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.987
And do you know
what people told me?

20:55.822 --> 20:57.590
How brave I was.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.528
That little girl
is going to be fine.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.431
We are so close.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.172
Sure.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.678
Whatever you say.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.001
Hey!

21:42.034 --> 21:43.603
What the hell!

21:43.636 --> 21:45.304
See... What the...

21:49.542 --> 21:50.810
Thanks.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.313
-See you, Donna.
-Mmm.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.652
(PHONE RINGING)

22:00.653 --> 22:02.422
Everything okay?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.057
I'll be right there.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.471
PATRICK: Do you two
ever shut up?

22:19.138 --> 22:20.507
(FOOTSTEPS)

22:24.544 --> 22:26.813
Ethan fucking Kelly.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.816
Never thought
I'd be pleased to see you.

22:30.617 --> 22:31.751
Detective Finnegan.
Thanks, boys.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.689
(SIGHS)

22:36.723 --> 22:38.591
-You look well.
-Yeah?

22:38.625 --> 22:40.359
-Considering...
-Thanks.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.832
What are you doing here,
Detective?

22:46.098 --> 22:49.436
Ah, you know,
I came in for some
California sun.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.438
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.577
-Where is she?
-I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.546
-No?
-Mmm-mmm.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.514
Okay, have it your way.

23:03.816 --> 23:07.954
She's coming after you.
You know that, right?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.056
Oh, you're talking about Mia?

23:11.190 --> 23:13.693
You know, it's funny,
'cause the last thing
I remember

23:13.726 --> 23:16.028
is that I delivered her
safely into your custody.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.864
Like you don't know.

23:18.965 --> 23:19.966
I don't know.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.934
She got away.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.003
Wow.

23:25.337 --> 23:28.775
You know, you people
are completely,
utterly inept, you know that?

23:29.842 --> 23:31.944
-Come on.
-Why?

23:31.978 --> 23:33.746
I know she's here.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.783
Why else would you
have protection
on Donna Williams' place?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.985
-It's Ray's wife, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.853
Your old business partner?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.556
Donna's been having some
ex-boyfriend troubles

23:43.590 --> 23:44.824
and I've been helping
her out, that's all.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.495
You're selling the bar
right after you bought it?

23:48.528 --> 23:51.564
That would have been
a nice place. You fix it up.

23:52.231 --> 23:55.668
Yeah, well... (SIGHS)
Not all dreams
come true.

23:55.702 --> 23:56.969
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

23:57.504 --> 23:59.806
You're having some
cash-flow problems, Kelly?

24:01.641 --> 24:02.975
She's after her money,
isn't she?

24:04.310 --> 24:07.146
You know,
there's a lot of red tape
when you start a new business,

24:07.179 --> 24:10.016
especially in this city.
And it became a bit
of a headache.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.219
But maybe, you know what,
maybe you could buy the place.

24:13.252 --> 24:16.155
You could ask for another
loan from Marty.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.958
Come on!
We both want the same thing.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.696
You know
she's not going to stop.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.865
Let me help you here.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.672
Why didn't you tell the boys
that you were a cop?

24:33.606 --> 24:34.607
Hmm?

24:35.207 --> 24:36.809
No reason to ruin their day.

24:36.843 --> 24:40.012
No? You out here
alone, Detective?

24:40.680 --> 24:41.681
Huh?

24:42.815 --> 24:43.850
No backup.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.185
Going a little rogue?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.120
That's not my style.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.355
No.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.695
What are you going to do
if you find her?

25:00.633 --> 25:01.834
She's not here.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.271
Now get home safe.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.775
Aaron, Menashe...

25:08.808 --> 25:10.977
-Come on down here.
-(FOOTSTEPS)

25:11.978 --> 25:14.246
You change your mind, Kelly,
I'm at the same number.

25:15.214 --> 25:18.150
Aaron, if the detective needs
a ride back to the airport,

25:18.184 --> 25:20.186
give him one, will you?

25:29.228 --> 25:30.563
Sadie?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.301
Sadie?

25:47.146 --> 25:48.581
(SIGHS)

26:01.060 --> 26:02.629
(SIGHS) Shit.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.197
I wish all my patients
were as brave as you.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.134
She's great. I'm going to get
the paperwork started

26:08.167 --> 26:10.603
and then we can get her
home by this afternoon.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.138
Yay! Okay.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.006
You stay here.
I'll be right back.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.315
So...

26:24.450 --> 26:26.085
-Just need you to sign
this release form.
-DONNA: Okay.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.854
-Um...
-Write down...

26:28.187 --> 26:29.656
-All right.
-Good.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.296
-Hello, Alice.
-Hello.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.801
That's for you.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.205
Used to be mine.
Her name is Rosie.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.379
Her ear's torn.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.282
I know.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.686
But we're all a little broken,
aren't we?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.093
How are you feeling?

27:07.426 --> 27:09.796
Okay. Bored.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.235
I hear you've been
very brave.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.305
Who are you?

27:22.108 --> 27:23.209
I work in admin.

27:23.242 --> 27:26.713
You know,
boring hospital stuff,
paperwork. (CHUCKLES)

27:32.018 --> 27:33.352
Anyway...

27:33.886 --> 27:35.654
What's important
is you're okay.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.794
Bye.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.733
(SIGHS)

27:48.134 --> 27:49.836
Thank you so much
for everything.

27:49.869 --> 27:53.039
It's what we do.
But it's nice
to be appreciated.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.708
I know. (GIGGLES) Bye.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.048
Hey, we're all set.

28:03.415 --> 28:06.352
(SIGHS) Where'd you get
this from, sweetie?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.888
Someone at the hospital
gave her to me.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.025
-Say hi.
-Oh. That's nice.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.164
(DOOR OPENS)

28:20.132 --> 28:22.001
Brought you your
sugar-free vanilla latte.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.836
Yes, I made sure
it's sugar-free.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.037
Where have you been?

28:25.071 --> 28:27.006
And don't say coffee,
'cause it takes
about five minutes.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.307
I went to the gym.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.642
Jeez... What the fuck!

28:30.676 --> 28:33.279
You went to the hospital,
and don't even think
about lying to me

28:33.312 --> 28:35.047
because I checked
your search history.

28:35.081 --> 28:38.818
I just wanted
to see for myself.
I was careful. I swear.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.753
(COUGHS)

28:40.787 --> 28:42.021
Jesus. You're fucking crazy.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.991
Do you have any idea
what you've done, do you?

28:45.024 --> 28:46.325
No one saw.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.427
You were at a hospital, Sadie.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.429
There's fucking
cameras everywhere.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.900
Did you talk to her?
Was Ethan there?

28:53.933 --> 28:55.367
No. No.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.072
Alice is fine, by the way.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.876
Yeah, of course she's fine.
If I wanted her dead,
she'd be dead.

29:04.443 --> 29:08.781
That's right. I forgot.
You don't make mistakes.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.783
No, I leave that to you.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.153
This is fucking crazy,
I thought I could trust you.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.822
Trust?

29:17.356 --> 29:18.925
Why don't we talk
about trust?

29:20.126 --> 29:24.063
I was locked up
for 16 months.
You disappeared.

29:25.431 --> 29:29.001
Best part, the whole thing
was your idea.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.270
Would you be happier
if we were both behind bars?

29:32.204 --> 29:36.308
"Hack into the NSA, Sadie.
Get me behind their firewall,
Sadie."

29:37.844 --> 29:41.180
16 months of my life,
where the fuck were you?

29:42.248 --> 29:44.283
Yeah, let's talk about trust.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.986
I am not in the mood.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.389
And all I had to do
was give the State's Attorney
your name.

29:50.422 --> 29:51.623
They offered me probation.

29:51.657 --> 29:55.127
-I appreciate what you did.
-Well, ain't that sweet
of you?

29:57.864 --> 29:59.065
Yeah, I know.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.802
When you're inside,
time fucks with your head.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.539
One day becomes a week,
and a week feels like...

30:10.276 --> 30:11.844
Weird thing is,

30:12.912 --> 30:15.447
the years before
they slam the gates on you,

30:16.515 --> 30:20.019
compresses,
like when you step
on a beer can or something.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.923
One day you're sitting
in the bleachers
in Candlestick

30:23.956 --> 30:25.557
eating a big frog ice cream,

30:27.293 --> 30:29.161
the next,
you're fucking dyke-bait.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.165
Tell me,

30:34.333 --> 30:36.535
where did all that time
in between go?

30:39.171 --> 30:41.040
You stole it from me, Mia.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.442
-That's where it went.
-No.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.878
We were partners
from the start.

30:46.278 --> 30:49.148
When that cop
with sweaty pits
and cigar breath

30:49.181 --> 30:51.250
was questioning me
for 13 hours,

30:52.952 --> 30:54.453
where were you, partner?

30:57.623 --> 30:59.325
I just wondered...

31:01.994 --> 31:04.196
If it had gone down
the other way,

31:05.932 --> 31:08.134
if you were locked
in that room

31:08.500 --> 31:11.037
with that disgusting
bald fuck,

31:12.304 --> 31:13.872
what would you have done?

31:18.510 --> 31:21.914
When four bitches
shoved you
into the supply closet,

31:22.581 --> 31:25.317
and two hold you down
while the other two...

31:28.020 --> 31:30.056
Would you have given them
my name then?

31:31.590 --> 31:33.559
What do you say, partner?

31:43.202 --> 31:46.605
Now you know why I don't
want you to fuck me
with the lights on.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.507
Sadie...

32:08.260 --> 32:09.528
Interrupt your lunch?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.998
Gegs. Nine. Four.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.334
-"Gegs"?
-G-E-G-S.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.703
Gegs. Been stuck
on it for 20 minutes.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.106
Scrambled eggs.

32:22.674 --> 32:23.542
-Son of a bitch.
-Hmm.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.745
You did the blood work
for the girls, right?

32:26.778 --> 32:27.846
Yep.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.582
And you found significant
levels of lithium carbonate?

32:30.616 --> 32:31.617
I did.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.154
That's the same stuff
that forms on the anodes
of batteries, right?

32:37.456 --> 32:38.524
What?

32:38.557 --> 32:41.393
I minored in chemistry.
Not a lot of people know that.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.229
Our secret.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.399
It's also used to treat
bipolar disorder,
manic depression.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.668
Oh, you think the guys
gave a shit about
the girls' mental state?

32:49.701 --> 32:51.603
(SCOFFS) Probably not.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.140
So if there's an electrical
component to the chip,

32:54.173 --> 32:56.508
it's possible that
the lithium carbonate
came from there?

32:56.775 --> 32:59.178
It's possible.
But without examining
the chip,

32:59.211 --> 33:00.279
there's no way to be sure.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.713
All right. Look at this.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.219
The girls who were there
the longest have the highest
levels of lithium carbonate

33:07.253 --> 33:08.454
in their blood.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.723
So it's reasonable
to assume that
it's connected to the chip?

33:11.757 --> 33:13.559
-It's reasonable.
-Mmm-hmm.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.162
-And stuff is toxic?
-In sufficient levels.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.597
-It could kill you?
-Yes, it would.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.566
Thank you.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.644
Regan, it's me.
I got something.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.090
ETHAN: Hey,
you two need a ride?

33:44.123 --> 33:46.258
-Uncle Ethan!
-Ethan!

33:46.292 --> 33:47.293
Hey.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.161
Wow, that's a cute bear.

33:49.195 --> 33:52.431
He kind of looks like
he could use a little bit
of surgery, though.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.434
-She. Her name's Rosie.
-She. I'm sorry.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.836
-Someone at the hospital
gave her to me.
-(PHONE RINGING)

33:57.869 --> 33:59.605
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.576
-Michelle's picking us up.
-Well, I told her I was going
to give you a ride.

34:04.610 --> 34:05.777
You don't need to do that.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.380
Well, like you said,
every man is helpless
without a task.

34:08.647 --> 34:09.748
I did.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.517
I want to ride
with Uncle Ethan.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.818
(PHONE RINGING)

34:15.387 --> 34:17.756
-Do you need to get that?
-No, no. It can wait.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.825
-Here, let me take that.
-Okay.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.095
-You want to go fast?
-Yeah.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.231
-You ready?
-(SQUEALS)

34:25.497 --> 34:27.166
(DONNA AND ALICE LAUGH)

34:28.267 --> 34:29.435
And what is it I'm reading?

34:29.701 --> 34:31.137
Forensics report, sir.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.340
All of the trafficked girls
had lithium carbonate
in their blood samples.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.376
And so does my niece,
prescribed by her shrink.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.246
She's doing fine,
in case you're interested.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.581
I don't think these guys
care about the girls'
psychological states.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.117
Our theory is that
the lithium carbonate

34:45.151 --> 34:47.653
came from the electrical
components in the chips.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.156
The longer the chip
is in the girl,
the higher the levels of...

34:50.189 --> 34:52.124
You're assuming that
all the girls arrived here

34:52.158 --> 34:53.792
and had the chip implanted
when they arrived?

34:53.825 --> 34:54.760
We are.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.662
And that they all arrived
at different times?

34:56.695 --> 34:58.130
No, that we're sure of.

34:58.164 --> 35:02.334
A report written by
Professor Robert Cooke at
Cornell stating conclusively

35:02.368 --> 35:05.904
if the blood level of lithium
carbonate is too high,
it becomes toxic.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.307
How do we know it's not just
the California air?

35:09.175 --> 35:12.344
-We don't, but...
-How can the State
take a chance, right?

35:12.378 --> 35:13.845
That's what we're thinking,
Your Honor.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.450
I've prepared an order to show
cause why the chip should
be removed from the girl.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.187
(SIGHS)

35:35.834 --> 35:37.336
MIA: Hey.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.606
(SIGHS)

35:49.681 --> 35:50.882
Sadie?

35:53.685 --> 35:56.222
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

36:00.292 --> 36:01.660
Don't leave.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.463
You can stay in the apartment,
rent is paid till the end
of the month.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.864
I'm sorry. Okay?

36:06.365 --> 36:09.535
Too late. I am not cut out
for this shit.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.373
Well, he came up
with another 800 K.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.443
-What?
-Kelly.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.513
He came up with another
$800,000, cash.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.250
(SCOFFS)
Why didn't you tell me?

36:25.484 --> 36:26.918
I was holding out for more.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.555
That's $1.3 million.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.790
-Mia...
-I know, I know,
you're right, okay?

36:32.358 --> 36:35.961
Let's get it and let's
get the fuck out of here.
You and me, together.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.932
Thank you.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.737
Ah.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.406
Make that two.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.641
-Aren't you on duty?
-(LAUGHS)

37:22.674 --> 37:23.842
That's funny.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.681
You been ignoring my calls.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.418
Uh, I've been
a little preoccupied.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.987
Preoccupied?
Old girlfriend on the side
you want to tell me about?

37:36.488 --> 37:37.856
No, I was helping
out a friend.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.759
Aren't you the knight
in shining fucking armor?

37:47.499 --> 37:48.900
See, I think you're lying.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.603
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.606
I think you've
been avoiding me.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.977
You sound
like my ex-girlfriend.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.383
We'll have one more
for the road.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.619
-Come on.
-Come on where?

38:08.487 --> 38:09.588
I got a little job for you.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.057
What is that?

38:12.090 --> 38:14.593
Well, now, that would
spoil the whole fucking
surprise now, wouldn't it?

38:16.528 --> 38:19.064
Let's go.
Oh, can leave your piece.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.667
No need. Not this time.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.471
If you say so.

38:30.776 --> 38:31.810
(SIGHS)

38:39.951 --> 38:42.388
You want the good news
or the bad?

38:42.421 --> 38:45.457
Judge gave
the go-ahead to move
the girl to a foster family.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.792
I'll send you the address.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.395
And the bad news,
he's allowing the surgery.

38:49.428 --> 38:52.664
Yeah, well, we knew
it was never going to be
more than a stalling tactic.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.900
MAN ON TV: ...is a very
elusive substance.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.769
Experts had to search
for it constantly.

38:57.803 --> 38:59.037
Petroleum.

39:00.772 --> 39:04.743
A power source like that
must be a highly-prized
State secret.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.111
I had to find out about it.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.847
Mmm.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.583
Perhaps the secret lay within
this government archive.

39:15.954 --> 39:20.392
So, my mother,
this beautiful Irish woman,
from Kenmare.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.927
Oh, there's a great
fucking pub I used to go to.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.664
What was it called?
Uh, Crowleys. Ooh... (LAUGHS)

39:27.699 --> 39:28.900
What was I saying?

39:28.934 --> 39:30.802
-I have no fucking idea.
-Oh.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.506
Her father brought the whole
family to California

39:34.540 --> 39:35.907
by way of the
Transcontinental Railroad.

39:35.941 --> 39:40.111
They lived in Oakland
and my grandfather owned
the neighborhood market.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.813
All the micks went there.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.849
It was kind of like
a one-stop shop,
my grandfather's market.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.084
You get your meat,
you get your booze,

39:46.117 --> 39:48.687
my grandmother's
homemade soda bread

39:48.720 --> 39:50.956
with a sweet spoonful
of honey.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.424
The best in the city.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.993
Family-owned, family-run,
the way it should be,
you know what I'm saying?

39:55.627 --> 39:57.696
Up front on the register,
Logan.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.565
Doing the deliveries, Sean.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.667
And keeping the books
out back was Reese.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.471
The only person who worked
there that wasn't actually
part of the family

40:05.504 --> 40:07.706
was my grandfather's
best friend Nolan.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.710
-Fucking Nolan.
-Where are we going, Oaks?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.712
So Reese, although
he was still in high school,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.482
was really good with numbers,
like, Harvard good.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.116
He started to notice some
discrepancies, you know,

40:18.149 --> 40:19.518
like a dollar here,
a dollar there.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.719
First it didn't seem
like much.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.455
Then it turned into
two dollars, five dollars.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.091
Before you know it,
the shop's running into some
real cash-flow problems.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.460
-You get my drift?
-Nah, not really.

40:28.494 --> 40:31.463
Okay. Reese asked Nolan
about the discrepancy.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.966
Nolan says Mrs. O'Sullivan's
husband just lost his job.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.069
So, he lets her come in
once a week and lets her
take home a ham, eggs,

40:38.103 --> 40:40.171
bread, milk, for the family.
Okay.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.809
So my grandfather runs
into Mrs. O'Sullivan

40:43.842 --> 40:46.512
at the St. Paddy's parade
at Market Street that year,

40:46.545 --> 40:49.080
and she says Mr. O'Sullivan
never lost his job.

40:49.915 --> 40:53.885
Turns out that Nolan was just
a dirty fucking thief.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.894
Is there a fucking point
to this story?

41:02.928 --> 41:04.896
Yeah, Red,
the fucking point is...

41:04.930 --> 41:05.931
(TIRES SCREECH)

41:16.141 --> 41:17.843
(GUNSHOT)

41:28.119 --> 41:31.590
Now, just so we're clear,
I'm going to keep going
down the line

41:31.623 --> 41:33.959
until one of you tells me
what I want to know.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.763
And when I get
what I want to know,

41:37.796 --> 41:40.231
you all get to go home.
We good?

41:40.899 --> 41:43.569
I just kicked up
to the motherfucker.
Why would I rob his ass?

41:46.004 --> 41:49.074
That was not the answer
that I was looking for.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.408
Your turn.

41:50.441 --> 41:53.278
I don't know anything
about a robbery,
I swear to God.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.880
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:55.113 --> 41:58.684
I don't know any of you,
I don't know
about any pool boy.

41:59.585 --> 42:02.554
What about you two?
Either of you ready to talk?

42:02.588 --> 42:04.790
Fuck off. I want to talk
to your superior.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.659
My superior.
That's a good one.
Where's the fucking money?

42:08.226 --> 42:10.996
Listen, fuck nuts,
if you're going to shoot me,
just shoot me.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.099
But I'm a fucking cop.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.668
I'm an integral part
of this operation.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.606
And I have the connects.
I do the bidding,

42:20.639 --> 42:22.007
you rub me out,
you'd be dead by breakfast.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.010
Where's the money?

42:26.211 --> 42:27.613
Wow.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.682
Go ahead. I dare ya.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.823
I'm a fucking cop.
You can't shoot a fucking cop.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.268
What the...

43:01.913 --> 43:03.281
You can't do this to me,
please, you can't.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.652
Do you know who I am?
Please...

43:07.318 --> 43:11.189
I got your fucking money.
$800,000.
Now put the guns away.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.124
(SIGHS)

43:35.346 --> 43:37.315
Hey, there. Richard Fogel
from Child Services.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.751
This is my colleague,
Roger Seeger.

43:40.051 --> 43:43.922
MAN ON TV:
They merely substituted
the word "oil" for petroleum.

43:44.355 --> 43:49.294
And I assume that holds
a veritable mine
of classified information.

43:56.301 --> 44:00.706
MATHES: Detective Casey Oaks,
a decorated veteran
of the force of 15 years,

44:00.739 --> 44:02.708
laid down his life
earlier today

44:02.908 --> 44:06.411
in the ongoing drug war
with San Francisco's
criminal gangs.

44:07.278 --> 44:11.917
Detective Oaks
called for back-up to the
1500 block of Eddy Street,

44:11.950 --> 44:14.953
where there was a suspected
drug deal in progress.

44:15.220 --> 44:18.356
He made the heroic
decision to enter
an abandoned warehouse,

44:18.389 --> 44:21.893
engaged two known
47th Street gang members,

44:21.927 --> 44:24.730
Alejandro Rojas
and Hector Torres.

44:25.997 --> 44:29.134
We believe Detective Oaks
was pinned down by gunfire,

44:29.735 --> 44:32.871
fought valiantly, and took
out Rojas and Torres.

44:33.471 --> 44:37.175
But unfortunately,
Detective Oaks lost his life
in the line of duty.

44:37.208 --> 44:39.711
HITTER: Son of a bitch
dies a hero.

44:40.245 --> 44:43.414
Probably get a plaque
or something.
Hmm, maybe a bench.

44:44.149 --> 44:47.786
(SIGHS) You cannot trust
the fucking news.

44:47.819 --> 44:52.023
I'm able to confirm, however,
that seven kilos of black
tar heroin were seized,

44:52.057 --> 44:54.292
along with $800,000 in cash.

44:54.760 --> 44:59.030
Don't worry. Money's
a short-term investment.
You'll get it back.

44:59.064 --> 45:00.331
I'll take questions
at this time.

45:01.767 --> 45:03.034
Who are you people?

45:12.277 --> 45:14.813
As you may have noticed,
you're still breathing.

45:16.014 --> 45:18.784
Mention a word of this
to anyone and that won't
be the case for long.

45:19.951 --> 45:22.788
-We've kept you around
for a reason, Kelly.
-(ZIPS JACKET)

45:23.288 --> 45:26.457
Oaks dropped
the fucking ball.
Make sure you don't.

45:27.893 --> 45:29.427
Expect to be hearing from us.

45:31.129 --> 45:32.463
(DOOR OPENS)

45:35.200 --> 45:36.367
(DOOR SHUTS)

45:45.977 --> 45:48.213
Let's get our money
and get out of here.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.824
(LINE RINGING)

46:15.273 --> 46:16.507
What is it?

46:17.308 --> 46:19.244
Son of a bitch
isn't answering.

46:22.147 --> 46:23.882
(LINE RINGING)

46:38.096 --> 46:40.198
Kelly, you better
not be avoiding me.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.500
I want my $800,000
and I want it now.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.536
You keep me waiting,
you know what's going
to happen to those kids.

46:50.575 --> 46:53.244
MIA: I want my $800,000
and I want it now.

46:54.145 --> 46:57.315
You keep me waiting,
you know what's going
to happen to those kids.

46:57.883 --> 46:59.017
(SIGHS)

47:14.365 --> 47:17.002
St. Margaret's called.
Surgery slot's opened up.

47:17.035 --> 47:18.403
Thought I'd go by,
pick her up myself.

47:18.436 --> 47:19.437
Okay.

47:20.671 --> 47:21.940
Clea?

47:23.441 --> 47:26.077
-Nice work on this one.
-Thank you, sir.

47:52.070 --> 47:54.172
Shouldn't there be a uni
on the door?

48:03.982 --> 48:05.650
Fuck. Call it in.

48:08.186 --> 48:09.387
Request backup and a bus.

48:09.687 --> 48:12.423
Officer down
at 695 Hill Street.

48:12.991 --> 48:14.459
Repeat, officer down.

48:15.693 --> 48:16.962
Shit.

48:27.072 --> 48:28.373
She's gone.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.976
They took her.

48:42.487 --> 48:43.989
Had a feeling you'd call.

48:46.624 --> 48:48.526
-(DOOR SHUTS)
-Did you now?

48:52.497 --> 48:54.532
You got one of those for me?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.067
Nope.

49:01.439 --> 49:04.042
-She's here.
-I knew it.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.678
You know, seeing as you
fucked up the first time,

49:07.712 --> 49:09.414
I'm going to give you
a second chance at her.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.416
That's very big of you.

49:11.782 --> 49:12.984
It is.

49:13.751 --> 49:16.387
What you mean is,
you need my help.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.692
You know, as much
as it pains me to say it...

49:23.661 --> 49:24.729
Yeah.
