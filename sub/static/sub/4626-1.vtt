00:10.427 --> 00:13.462
<i>Once upon a time,
long, long ago--</i>

00:13.496 --> 00:16.198
<i>Well, more like
20 years ago--</i>

00:16.232 --> 00:19.234
<i>Belle married her beast
in front of 6,000</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:22.071
<i>of their closest
personal friends.</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:23.439
<i>Big cake.</i>

00:23.473 --> 00:25.340
<i>Yeah, so instead
of a honeymoon,</i>

00:25.375 --> 00:27.309
<i>beast united
all of the kingdoms</i>

00:27.343 --> 00:31.246
<i>and got himself elected king of
the United States of auradon.</i>

00:31.281 --> 00:34.183
<i>He rounded up all the
villains and sidekicks--</i>

00:34.217 --> 00:36.251
<i>Basically all the really
interesting people--</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:39.088
<i>And he booted them off
to the isle of the lost</i>

00:39.122 --> 00:41.423
<i>with a magical barrier
to keep them there.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:43.525
<i>This is my hood.</i>

00:43.560 --> 00:45.260
<i>No magic.</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:47.496
<i>No Wi-Fi.</i>

00:47.530 --> 00:51.100
<i>No way out.
Or so I thought.</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:53.302
<i>Hang on,
you're about to meet us.</i>

00:53.336 --> 00:55.404
<i>But first this happened.</i>

01:00.176 --> 01:02.411
Sleeve. Head.

01:02.445 --> 01:04.446
Ah-ha.

01:06.182 --> 01:07.516
How is it possible

01:07.550 --> 01:09.518
that you're going to be
crowned king next month?

01:09.552 --> 01:11.153
You're just a baby!

01:11.187 --> 01:13.255
- He's turning 16, dear.
- Hey, pops.

01:13.289 --> 01:16.258
16? That's far too young
to be crowned king.

01:16.292 --> 01:19.361
I didn't make a good decision
until I was at least 42.

01:19.395 --> 01:22.331
Uh, you decided to marry me
at 28.

01:22.365 --> 01:24.433
Ah, it was either you
or a teapot.

01:24.467 --> 01:27.269
Kidding.

01:27.303 --> 01:28.570
Mom, dad--

01:28.605 --> 01:31.206
Ah! Nn-nnh!

01:31.241 --> 01:33.475
I've chosen my first
official proclamation.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.246
I've decided that the children
on the isle of the lost

01:37.280 --> 01:39.181
be given a chance

01:39.215 --> 01:40.516
to live here in auradon.

01:42.218 --> 01:44.119
Every time I look out
to the island,

01:44.154 --> 01:45.514
I feel like
they've been abandoned.

01:45.522 --> 01:50.092
The children of our sworn
enemies, living among us?

01:50.126 --> 01:52.227
We start out
with a few at first,

01:52.262 --> 01:54.496
only the ones
who need our help the most.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.498
I've already chosen them.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.433
Have you?

01:58.468 --> 02:01.336
I gave you a second chance.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.504
Who are their parents?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.407
Cruella De vil...

02:05.441 --> 02:07.342
Jafar...

02:07.377 --> 02:09.110
Evil queen...

02:11.381 --> 02:12.514
And maleficent.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.216
- Ah!
- Maleficent!

02:14.250 --> 02:17.119
She is the worst villain
in the land!

02:17.153 --> 02:19.488
- Dad, just hear me out here.
- I won't hear of it.

02:19.522 --> 02:22.357
Oh, oh. -They are guilty
of unspeakable crimes.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.393
Dad, their children
are innocent.

02:24.427 --> 02:27.496
Don't you think they deserve
a shot at a normal life?

02:27.530 --> 02:29.164
Dad?

02:37.473 --> 02:39.441
I suppose their children
are innocent.

02:45.548 --> 02:47.549
Well.
Well done.

02:50.453 --> 02:52.254

06:11.154 --> 06:14.056
Stealing candy, mal?

06:14.090 --> 06:15.490
I'm so disappointed.

06:15.525 --> 06:17.359
It was from a baby.

06:17.393 --> 06:20.062
Ah!
That's my nasty little girl.

06:25.168 --> 06:27.135
Give it back
to the dreadful creature.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.337
- Mom--
- It's the deets, mal,

06:29.372 --> 06:34.109
that make the difference
between mean and truly evil.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.211
When I was your age,

06:36.245 --> 06:38.246
- I was cursing entire kingdoms.
- "Cursing entire kingdoms."

06:38.281 --> 06:39.514
You. Walk with me.

06:39.549 --> 06:42.517
See, I'm just,
just trying to teach you

06:42.552 --> 06:47.155
the thing that really counts--
How to be me.

06:47.190 --> 06:50.292
I know that.
And I'll do better.

06:51.561 --> 06:54.429
Oh! There's news!
I buried the lede.

06:54.464 --> 06:57.232
You four have been chosen

06:57.266 --> 06:59.401
to go to a different school...

06:59.435 --> 07:01.169
In auradon.

07:01.204 --> 07:04.306
- Whoa!
- Oh, oh, oh!

07:04.340 --> 07:08.076
What? I'm not going
to some boarding school

07:08.111 --> 07:10.445
filled to the brim
with prissy pink princesses!

07:10.480 --> 07:13.281
And perfect princes.
Ugh.

07:13.316 --> 07:15.484
Yeah,
and I don't do uniforms.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.153
Unless it's leather.
You feel me?

07:18.187 --> 07:22.124
I read somewhere that they
allow dogs in auradon.

07:22.158 --> 07:24.092
Mom said they're
rabid pack animals

07:24.127 --> 07:26.294
who eat boys
who don't behave.

07:26.329 --> 07:28.130
- Woof!
- Yeah, mom, we're not going.

07:28.164 --> 07:30.165
Oh, you're thinking small,
pumpkin.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.368
It's all about
world domination.

07:33.402 --> 07:35.170
Knuckleheads!

07:37.206 --> 07:39.107
Mal...

07:41.377 --> 07:43.044
You will go.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.046
You will find
the fairy godmother

07:45.081 --> 07:47.115
and you will bring me back
her magic wand.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.184
Easy peasy.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.385
What's in it for us?

07:50.419 --> 07:53.455
Matching thrones.
Hers-and-hers crowns.

07:53.489 --> 07:57.092
Um, I--
I think she meant us.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.394
It's all about
you and me, baby.

07:59.428 --> 08:02.364
Do you enjoy watching
innocent people suffer?

08:02.398 --> 08:05.200
- Well, yeah. I mean, who doesn't--
- Well, then get me the wand

08:05.234 --> 08:08.103
and you and I can see
all that and so much more.

08:08.137 --> 08:10.472
And with that wand
and my scepter,

08:10.506 --> 08:15.143
I will be able to bend both
good and evil to my will!

08:15.178 --> 08:19.114
- Our will.
- Our will, our will.

08:19.148 --> 08:21.016
And if you refuse,

08:21.050 --> 08:22.417
you're grounded for the
rest of your life, missy.

08:22.451 --> 08:25.053
What-- mom--

08:37.299 --> 08:40.202
Fine. Whatever.

08:40.236 --> 08:42.304
- I win.
- Evie.

08:42.337 --> 08:45.173
My little evil-ette
in training,

08:45.208 --> 08:47.475
you just find yourself
a prince with a big castle

08:47.510 --> 08:50.245
and a mother-in-law wing.

08:50.279 --> 08:53.181
And lots and lots of mirrors!

08:53.216 --> 08:56.051
- Ah!
- No laughing. Wrinkles.

08:56.085 --> 08:57.285
Oh, well, they're not
taking my Carlos,

08:57.320 --> 09:00.355
- because I'd miss him too much.
- Really, mom?

09:00.389 --> 09:02.290
Yes. Who would touch up
my roots,

09:02.325 --> 09:05.193
fluff my fur, and scrape
the bunions off my feet?

09:05.228 --> 09:07.395
Yeah, maybe a new school
wouldn't be the worst thing.

09:07.430 --> 09:10.232
Oh, Carlos,
they have dogs in auradon.

09:10.266 --> 09:13.001
Oh, no! I'm not going!

09:13.035 --> 09:14.195
Well, Jay isn't going either.

09:14.203 --> 09:17.072
I need him to stock
the shelves in my store.

09:17.106 --> 09:19.407
What did you score?

09:19.442 --> 09:22.244
Oh. Ooh.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.114
A lamp.

09:26.148 --> 09:30.085
Dad.

09:30.119 --> 09:32.287
- I already tried.
- Ah!

09:32.321 --> 09:34.155
Evie's not going anywhere

09:34.190 --> 09:36.258
until we get rid
of this unibrow, hmm?

09:36.292 --> 09:38.093
What is wrong with you all?

09:38.127 --> 09:42.197
People used to cower
at the mention of our names!

09:43.532 --> 09:47.068
For 20 years, I have searched
for a way off this island.

09:47.103 --> 09:50.171
For 20 years, they have
robbed us from our revenge--

09:50.206 --> 09:52.474
Revenge on snow white and her
horrible little men. -Ow!

09:52.508 --> 09:54.509
Revenge on Aladdin and his
bloated genie! -I will--

09:54.543 --> 09:57.345
Pop! -Revenge on every
sneaky dalmatian

09:57.380 --> 09:59.447
that escaped your clutches.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.149
Oh, but they didn't
get baby.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.517
They didn't get the--

10:02.551 --> 10:06.354
They didn't get the baby!

10:06.389 --> 10:08.123
And I, maleficent...

10:09.325 --> 10:12.060
The evilest of them all,

10:12.094 --> 10:16.064
I will finally
have my revenge

10:16.098 --> 10:17.532
on sleeping beauty

10:17.566 --> 10:20.535
and her relentless
little prince.

10:20.569 --> 10:22.270
- Villains!
- Yes.

10:22.305 --> 10:24.072
Yes?

10:24.106 --> 10:26.274
- Our day has come.
- Hmm.

10:26.309 --> 10:29.444
- E.Q., give her the magic mirror.
- Yeah.

10:29.478 --> 10:32.380
This is your magic mirror?

10:32.415 --> 10:34.382
Yeah, well, it ain't
what it used to be,

10:34.417 --> 10:36.318
but then again,
neither are we!

10:36.352 --> 10:39.220
- It will help you find things.
- Like a prince?

10:39.255 --> 10:42.324
Like my waistline. -Like
the magic wand! Hello!

10:42.358 --> 10:45.560
Hello. -My spell book. My book.
I need my-- that book.

10:45.594 --> 10:48.196
Oh, ah!
The safe. The safe.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.098
Queen, help me!

10:50.132 --> 10:52.400
I never can
figure this thing out.

10:52.435 --> 10:54.469
Voil.

10:54.503 --> 10:57.472
My spell--
Come, darling. Come.

10:57.506 --> 11:00.141
Oh-- ooh!
Oh, oh.

11:00.176 --> 11:03.411
There she is. It doesn't work
here, but it will in auradon.

11:03.446 --> 11:07.282
Remember? When we were spreading
evil and ruining lives.

11:07.316 --> 11:09.084
Like it was yesterday.

11:09.118 --> 11:13.254
And now you will be
making your own memories

11:15.157 --> 11:17.292
by doing exactly
as I tell you.

11:17.326 --> 11:18.426
Door.

11:18.461 --> 11:21.096
Oh.

11:21.130 --> 11:24.099
Whoo! Let's get
this party started!

11:24.133 --> 11:26.134
Carlos! Come.

11:26.168 --> 11:27.402
Who is the fairest
of them all?

11:27.436 --> 11:28.403
- Me.
- Ah!

11:28.437 --> 11:30.138
- You.
- Yes! Let's go.

11:30.172 --> 11:32.307
- Now, recite our mantra.
- There's no team in "I".

11:32.341 --> 11:35.143
Oh, run along.
You're making me tear up.

11:35.177 --> 11:36.378
- My bag.
- Yeah.

11:36.412 --> 11:38.213
- Dad!
- Coming!

11:51.427 --> 11:55.497
The future of the free world
rests on your shoulders.

11:55.531 --> 11:58.133
Don't blow it.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.508
Mal!

12:21.257 --> 12:23.291
Ah!
Smells like common folk.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.560
Come back here, now!

12:27.263 --> 12:29.097
Carlos!

12:29.131 --> 12:30.432
Ingrate.

12:50.152 --> 12:51.286
Bye-bye.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.088
The jackals have landed.

12:57.159 --> 12:58.326
Bring home the gold!

12:58.360 --> 12:59.494
Bring home a puppy.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.296
Bring home a prince.

13:18.147 --> 13:19.507
You're looking
a little washed out.

13:19.515 --> 13:22.050
- Let me help you out.
- Ew, stop.

13:22.084 --> 13:23.384
I'm plotting.

13:23.419 --> 13:25.520
Well,
it's not very attractive.

13:27.156 --> 13:28.356
Oh!

13:28.390 --> 13:31.092
These!
It's salty like nuts,

13:31.126 --> 13:33.061
but it's sweet
like I don't know what.

13:33.095 --> 13:35.430
Let me see.

13:35.464 --> 13:37.298
- Ew!
- Ow!

13:42.471 --> 13:44.239
Look!

13:49.245 --> 13:53.281
It's a trap!

14:02.224 --> 14:04.092
What just happened?

14:06.495 --> 14:09.030
It must be magic.

14:09.064 --> 14:10.331
Hey.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.367
Did this little button

14:12.401 --> 14:14.135
just open up
the magic barrier?

14:14.169 --> 14:17.205
No, this one opens
the magic barrier.

14:17.239 --> 14:20.041
That one opens my garage.

14:20.075 --> 14:22.443
And this button...

14:25.347 --> 14:27.415
Okay.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.218
Nasty.
I like that guy.

15:06.055 --> 15:08.489
Oh! Ah! Ow! Stop!

15:08.524 --> 15:11.025
You got everything else!

15:11.060 --> 15:12.493
Why do you want
whatever this is?

15:12.528 --> 15:14.329
- 'Cause you want it!
- No!

15:14.363 --> 15:16.397
- Give it to me!
- Ow!

15:16.432 --> 15:18.266
- Let go!
- Guys, guys, guys!

15:18.300 --> 15:20.335
We have an audience.

15:20.369 --> 15:23.404
Just cleaning up.

15:23.439 --> 15:26.040
Get up.

15:26.075 --> 15:28.476
Leave it like you found it!

15:28.510 --> 15:30.411
And by that,
I mean just leave it.

15:36.218 --> 15:38.453
Hello, foxy.

15:38.487 --> 15:43.257
The name's Jay.

15:46.228 --> 15:49.297
Welcome to auradon prep.

15:49.331 --> 15:52.300
I'm fairy godmother,
headmistress.

15:52.334 --> 15:54.168
The fairy godmother?

15:54.203 --> 15:57.105
As in, "bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?

15:57.139 --> 15:58.539
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
You know it.

15:58.574 --> 16:02.477
Yeah, I always wondered what
it felt like for cinderella

16:02.511 --> 16:06.247
when you just appeared,
out of nowhere,

16:06.281 --> 16:11.019
with that sparkly wand
and warm smile.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.488
- Oh.
- And that sparkling wand.

16:13.522 --> 16:16.457
That was a long time ago.
And as I always say,

16:16.492 --> 16:19.460
"don't focus on the past
or you'll miss the future."

16:21.163 --> 16:23.131
It's so good to finally
meet you all.

16:23.165 --> 16:26.200
- I'm Ben.
- Prince Benjamin.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.203
- Soon to be king.
- You had me at prince.

16:29.238 --> 16:33.441
My mom's a queen,
which makes me a Princess.

16:33.475 --> 16:37.045
The evil queen
has no royal status here

16:37.079 --> 16:38.446
and neither do you.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.149
This is Audrey.

16:41.183 --> 16:44.419
Princess Audrey.
His girlfriend.

16:44.453 --> 16:46.154
Right, bennyboo?

16:46.188 --> 16:50.058
Ben and Audrey are going
to show you all around,

16:50.092 --> 16:51.325
and I'll see you tomorrow.

16:52.461 --> 16:57.165
The doors of wisdom
are never shut.

16:57.199 --> 16:59.200
But the library hours
are from 8:00 to 11:00.

16:59.234 --> 17:02.036
And as you may have heard, I have
a little thing about curfews.

17:13.415 --> 17:17.484
It is so, so, so good
to finally me-- meet you all.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.060
This is a momentous occasion,

17:26.095 --> 17:30.431
and one that I hope
will go down in history...

17:30.466 --> 17:32.366
Is that chocolate?

17:32.401 --> 17:35.136
...as the day our two peoples
began to heal.

17:35.170 --> 17:39.307
Or the day that you showed four
peoples where the bathrooms are.

17:41.210 --> 17:42.276
A little bit over the top?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.178
A little more
than a little bit.

17:44.213 --> 17:46.414
Well, so much
for my first impression.

17:50.085 --> 17:52.186
Hey! You're maleficent's
daughter, aren't you?

17:52.221 --> 17:55.156
Yeah, you know what? I totally
do not blame you for your mother

17:55.190 --> 17:57.391
trying to kill my parents
and stuff.

17:57.426 --> 18:00.194
Oh, my mom's Aurora.
Sleeping--

18:00.229 --> 18:03.297
Beauty!
Yeah, I've heard the name.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.434
You know, and I totally
do not blame your grandparents

18:06.468 --> 18:09.170
for inviting everyone
in the whole world

18:09.204 --> 18:13.074
but my mother
to their stupid christening.

18:13.108 --> 18:15.143
- Water under the bridge.
- Totes!

18:19.414 --> 18:22.250
Okay!
So, how about a tour?

18:22.284 --> 18:24.218
Yeah? Auradon prep,

18:24.253 --> 18:26.154
originally built
over 300 years ago

18:26.188 --> 18:27.488
and converted
into a high school

18:27.523 --> 18:29.323
by my father
when he became king.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.272
Carlos, it's okay.

18:44.306 --> 18:47.508
My father wanted his statue
to morph from beast to man

18:47.543 --> 18:50.111
to remind us that anything
is possible.

18:50.145 --> 18:51.345
Does he shed much?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.414
Yeah, mom won't let him
on the couch.

19:07.129 --> 19:10.231
So you guys have a lot
of magic here in auradon?

19:10.265 --> 19:13.067
Like wands
and things like that?

19:13.101 --> 19:16.404
Yeah, it exists of course,
but it's pretty much retired.

19:16.438 --> 19:20.274
Most of us here
are just ordinary mortals.

19:20.309 --> 19:23.044
Who happened to be kings
and queens.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.212
That's true.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.480
Our royal blood
goes back hundreds of years.

19:28.383 --> 19:30.384
Doug. Doug, come down.

19:33.121 --> 19:34.288
This is Doug.

19:34.323 --> 19:36.203
He's going to help you
with your class schedules

19:36.225 --> 19:39.093
and show you
the rest of the dorms.

19:39.127 --> 19:40.228
I'll see you later, okay?

19:40.262 --> 19:43.297
And if there is anything
you need, feel free to--

19:43.332 --> 19:45.433
Ask Doug.

19:45.467 --> 19:48.269
Ha.

19:52.507 --> 19:55.209
Hi, guys. I'm dopey's son.

19:55.244 --> 19:59.113
As in dopey, doc, bashful,
happy, grumpy, sleepy, and...

20:01.383 --> 20:03.517
- Heigh-ho.
- Evie.

20:03.552 --> 20:06.053
Evil queen's daughter.

20:06.088 --> 20:09.090
Okay.
So about your classes,

20:09.124 --> 20:11.058
I, uh, put in
the requirements already--

20:11.093 --> 20:12.360
History of woodsmen
and pirates,

20:12.394 --> 20:14.262
safety rules
for the Internet,

20:14.296 --> 20:18.299
and, uh,
remedial goodness 101.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.369
Let me guess.
New class?

20:24.339 --> 20:26.340
Come on, guys,
let's go find our dorms.

20:30.412 --> 20:33.214
Oh, uh, yeah, your dorms
are that way, guys.

20:35.284 --> 20:40.154
Dopey, doc, bashful,
happy, grumpy, sleepy, and...

20:40.188 --> 20:42.390
Sneezy.

20:54.569 --> 20:58.272
Wow.
This place is so amaz--

20:58.307 --> 21:02.209
Gross. -I know, right?
Amazingly gross.

21:02.244 --> 21:03.511
Ew.

21:03.545 --> 21:07.214
Ugh! I'm going to need
some serious sunscreen.

21:07.249 --> 21:09.216
- Yeah.
- E.

21:16.091 --> 21:19.293
Whew! That is much better.

21:24.366 --> 21:29.170
Whoo! Whoa! Ah!

21:33.241 --> 21:35.376
Whoa!

21:37.279 --> 21:39.347
Jay, what are you doing?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.415
It's called stealing.

21:41.450 --> 21:44.151
Okay, what's the point?

21:44.186 --> 21:46.554
Well, mal, it's like
buying whatever I want,

21:46.588 --> 21:49.090
except it's free.

21:49.124 --> 21:52.159
Okay.
So, you could do that,

21:52.194 --> 21:54.428
or you could leave
all of this here

21:54.463 --> 21:56.330
and pick it up
when we take over the world.

21:56.365 --> 21:58.232
You sound
just like your mom.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.267
Thank you.

22:00.302 --> 22:03.270
You do it your way
and I'll do it mine.

22:03.305 --> 22:05.072
Die, suckers!

22:05.107 --> 22:07.208
Jay, come check
this thing out.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.509
Man, it's awesome.

22:14.483 --> 22:16.484
Guys!

22:16.518 --> 22:19.053
Do I have to remind you
what we're all here for?

22:19.087 --> 22:21.122
Fairy godmother,
blah, blah, blah.

22:21.156 --> 22:23.457
Magic wand,
blah, blah, blah.

22:23.492 --> 22:28.362
This is our one chance to prove
ourselves to our parents.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.535
To prove that we are evil
and vicious

22:34.569 --> 22:38.506
and ruthless and cruel.
Yeah?

22:38.540 --> 22:40.141
Yeah.

22:40.175 --> 22:43.144
Evie, mirror me.

22:47.516 --> 22:50.418
Mirror, mirror on the--
In my hand,

22:50.452 --> 22:55.089
where is fairy godmother's
wand... stand?

22:57.125 --> 22:59.093
- There it is!
- Zoom out.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.328
Magic mirror, not so close.

23:01.363 --> 23:05.366
Closer. Closer.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.435
Closer.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.037
Can I go back to my game?
I'm on level three.

23:10.072 --> 23:11.205
Stop!

23:11.239 --> 23:13.474
It's in a museum.
Do we know where that is?

23:13.508 --> 23:18.145
2.3 miles from here.

23:22.517 --> 23:24.351
Come on.

23:28.423 --> 23:30.091
Carlos!

23:30.125 --> 23:31.525
Coming!

23:34.529 --> 23:37.098
Come on.

23:41.103 --> 23:42.436
Check your mirror.

23:42.471 --> 23:44.105
Is my mascara smudged?

23:44.139 --> 23:46.440
Yeah.
And, hey, while you're at it,

23:46.475 --> 23:49.343
why don't you see
if you can find us the wand?

23:49.377 --> 23:51.345
Sure. This way.

24:24.246 --> 24:28.282
That's your mother's
spinning wheel?

24:28.316 --> 24:30.084
Yeah, it's kinda dorky.

24:30.118 --> 24:34.054
It's magic.
It doesn't have to look scary.

24:34.089 --> 24:36.490
"Magic spindle,
do not linger.

24:36.525 --> 24:38.425
Make my victim
prick a finger."

24:41.296 --> 24:43.297
Impressive.

24:43.331 --> 24:46.167
I got chills.

24:46.201 --> 24:49.069
Okay, you know what?

24:49.104 --> 24:51.138
"Prick the finger,
prick it deep.

24:51.173 --> 24:53.107
Send my enemy off to sleep."

25:02.250 --> 25:03.484
Ooh!

25:18.133 --> 25:20.167
Not so dorky now, huh?

25:25.473 --> 25:28.209
Stand back.

25:30.178 --> 25:32.079
"Make it easy,
make it quick,

25:32.113 --> 25:34.281
open up without a kick."

25:34.316 --> 25:36.417
Ahh!

25:38.486 --> 25:40.354
Coming?

25:41.556 --> 25:45.059
- Come on, Jay.
- I'm good.

25:45.093 --> 25:47.061
Just trying to help.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.532
Shh.

26:00.075 --> 26:01.475
Carlos!
Coming.

26:04.346 --> 26:06.280
So close.

26:10.085 --> 26:11.252
Upstairs.

26:11.286 --> 26:14.054
Come on.
Go, go, go, go.

26:14.089 --> 26:15.456
Up, up, up, up, up.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.058
Come on, guys.
Almost there.

26:18.093 --> 26:19.360
Yeah.

26:34.209 --> 26:37.144
Mommy?

26:39.180 --> 26:40.514
Killer.

26:43.084 --> 26:46.153
I will never forget
mother's day again.

26:46.187 --> 26:50.257
Well, the wand's not here.
Let's bounce.

26:50.292 --> 26:52.159
Let's go.

27:01.069 --> 27:05.172

Here it is.

31:03.177 --> 31:04.244
Whoo!

31:24.232 --> 31:26.133
Jay, don't!

31:26.167 --> 31:28.435
Wait, no!
No! Don't!

31:28.469 --> 31:31.505
Ah!

31:33.308 --> 31:35.142
A force field
and a siren?

31:35.176 --> 31:37.144
That's just
a little excessive.

31:38.546 --> 31:40.314
Let's go!

31:50.325 --> 31:52.259
Hurry.

31:57.365 --> 31:58.398
Come on.

32:00.268 --> 32:03.270
Hello? Uh, uh,
just give me one second.

32:03.304 --> 32:04.338
One second.

32:08.376 --> 32:11.311
Uh, yeah, yeah.
No, false alarm.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.381
It was a malfunction
in the, uh,

32:14.415 --> 32:17.517
lm 714 chip
in the breadboard circuit.

32:17.552 --> 32:20.053
Yeah. Okay.
Say hi to the missus.

32:22.290 --> 32:24.157
Carlos!

32:24.192 --> 32:25.525
You're welcome.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.532
Way to go, Jay.

32:32.567 --> 32:35.068
Now we have to
go to school tomorrow.

32:40.942 --> 32:45.045
If someone hands you
a crying baby,

32:45.079 --> 32:48.181
do you,
a, curse it?

32:48.216 --> 32:51.284
B, lock it in a tower?

32:51.319 --> 32:55.022
C, give it a bottle?

32:55.056 --> 32:58.125
Or d,
carve out its heart?

32:59.360 --> 33:03.864
- Evie.
- What was the second one?

33:03.898 --> 33:05.999
Oh, okay.
Anyone else?

33:09.137 --> 33:10.971
Mal?

33:11.005 --> 33:12.272
C, give it a bottle.

33:12.306 --> 33:14.274
Correct. Again.

33:14.308 --> 33:16.109
You are on fire, girl!

33:16.144 --> 33:18.912
Just pick the one that
doesn't sound like any fun.

33:18.946 --> 33:21.214
- Oh.
- That makes so much sense.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.050
Oh...

33:25.086 --> 33:27.054
Oh.
Hello, dear one.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.090
Hi. You need to sign off on early
dismissal for the coronation.

33:31.893 --> 33:33.126
Everyone here remembers
my daughter, Jane?

33:33.161 --> 33:35.162
Mom, no!

33:35.196 --> 33:38.932
It's okay.
Jane, this is everyone.

33:38.966 --> 33:41.068
Hi.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.136
That's okay,
don't mind me.

33:43.171 --> 33:46.239
As you were.

33:49.043 --> 33:51.311
Ahem.
Let's continue.

33:51.345 --> 33:55.215
You find a vial of poison.

33:55.249 --> 33:59.886
Do you, a,
put it in the king's wine?

33:59.921 --> 34:03.123
B, paint it on an apple?

34:03.157 --> 34:07.160
Or c, turn it over
to the proper authorities?

34:07.195 --> 34:10.263
Oh! Ooh-- get off.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.864
Jay.

34:11.899 --> 34:14.835
C. You turn it over
to the proper authorities.

34:14.869 --> 34:16.168
I was gonna say that.

34:16.204 --> 34:18.804
But I said it first.
Come here!

34:18.840 --> 34:20.920
Ow! -Come on, who said it first?
Who said it first?

34:20.942 --> 34:24.911
- Ow! Stop! Ah!
- Boys.

34:24.946 --> 34:26.847
Boys!

34:26.880 --> 34:30.016
I am gonna encourage you
to use that energy

34:30.051 --> 34:32.152
on the tourney field.

34:32.186 --> 34:34.087
Oh, no. That's okay.

34:34.121 --> 34:36.822
Whatever that is,
we'll-- we'll pass.

34:38.226 --> 34:41.962
Jay, Ben, offense.
Chad, you're defense.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.130
- Taylor, you're the shooter.
- Right, coach!

34:44.165 --> 34:48.268
Hey. Hey! Hey, you.
Lost boy!

34:48.302 --> 34:51.905
Put your helmet on.
Get out of the kill zone!

34:51.938 --> 34:53.106
- Come on.
- Kill zone? Wha--

34:53.141 --> 34:56.009
- Pick it up.
- Put it on! Two hands.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.794
Ahh!

35:28.142 --> 35:29.242
Jay, it's me!
It's Carlos!

35:29.277 --> 35:32.078
Wait, stop, Jay. Stop!

35:32.113 --> 35:35.048
No, no, no, no. No!

35:46.127 --> 35:47.994
Ahh!

35:50.064 --> 35:53.166
Oh, yeah!
Come on, let's go!

35:53.201 --> 35:55.302
Oh! Whoo!

35:57.004 --> 35:58.205
Whoo, Whoo!
Oh! Oh!

35:58.239 --> 36:00.807
What just happened?
Who is this guy?

36:00.842 --> 36:04.778
You! Get over here!

36:13.921 --> 36:15.856
What do you call that?

36:17.024 --> 36:19.226
I call that raw talent.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.929
Come find me later. I'll show you
something you haven't seen before.

36:22.964 --> 36:27.234
It's called a rule book.
Welcome to the team, son.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.803
You ever thought about band?

36:31.906 --> 36:33.106
I'll work with him, coach.

36:33.140 --> 36:36.910
All right.
Let's run that again.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.112
Whoo!

36:41.115 --> 36:44.818
<i>♪ I'm rotten to the core. ♪</i>

36:44.852 --> 36:46.920
Ow.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.189
I know, I know.

36:49.223 --> 36:51.258
Those kids are trouble.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.294
- Bye, mal.
- Bye.

36:54.328 --> 36:57.264
Come on, Chad.
Give them a chance.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.165
Oh.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.802
No offense, bennybear,
but you're just too trusting.

37:02.837 --> 37:04.905
Look, I know your mom
fell in love

37:04.939 --> 37:07.774
with a big nasty beast
who turned out to be a prince.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.176
But with my mom,
the evil fairy

37:10.211 --> 37:12.879
was just the evil fairy.

37:12.914 --> 37:14.881
That girl's mother.

37:14.916 --> 37:17.150
I think
you're wrong about them.

37:17.184 --> 37:19.152
I'll see you later.

37:24.292 --> 37:27.093
- Hey!
- Hey.

37:27.128 --> 37:30.196
- How was your first day?
- Super.

37:30.231 --> 37:32.799
You should really think
about taking this talent

37:32.833 --> 37:34.234
off the locker
and into art class.

37:34.268 --> 37:38.204
I could, uh, sign you up.
What do you think?

37:42.877 --> 37:44.197
Way to take all the fun
out of it.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.152
Huh.

37:59.226 --> 38:01.928
Hi! It's Jane, right?

38:01.963 --> 38:05.999
Ah, always loved that name.
Jane.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.201
- That's cool.
- Don't go!

38:14.141 --> 38:17.243
I guess I was just kind
of hoping to make a friend.

38:17.278 --> 38:20.947
You probably have all the
friends you need though, huh?

38:20.982 --> 38:22.182
Hardly.

38:22.216 --> 38:26.019
Really?
I mean, with your mom

38:26.053 --> 38:29.923
being fairy godmother
and headmistress?

38:29.957 --> 38:34.894
I mean, not to mention
your own, um... personality.

38:36.197 --> 38:39.099
I'd rather be pretty.
You've got great hair.

38:41.302 --> 38:46.172
You know what? I have
just the thing for that.

38:47.208 --> 38:49.843
It's right...

38:51.245 --> 38:53.279
Ah, here.

38:53.314 --> 38:56.850
"Beware, forswear,
replace the old

38:56.884 --> 38:59.119
with brand new hair."

38:59.153 --> 39:01.888
Oh, ah, ah!

39:06.961 --> 39:08.795
Wow!

39:08.829 --> 39:11.031
You almost
don't notice your...

39:11.065 --> 39:13.767
Other features anymore.

39:16.904 --> 39:17.971
Do my nose!

39:18.005 --> 39:21.875
Oh, I can't.
I've been practicing,

39:21.909 --> 39:25.245
but you know,
I can't do really big magic.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.882
Not like your mom
with her wand.

39:28.916 --> 39:30.917
I mean, one swoosh
from that thing

39:30.951 --> 39:33.153
and you could probably have
whatever features you wanted.

39:33.187 --> 39:35.055
She doesn't use
the wand anymore.

39:35.089 --> 39:38.191
She believes the real magic
is in the books.

39:38.225 --> 39:40.060
And not the spell books,

39:40.094 --> 39:42.228
regular books with history
and stuff.

39:42.263 --> 39:44.798
What a rip.

39:44.832 --> 39:46.900
Yeah.

39:46.934 --> 39:49.035
You know, she used magic
on cinderella,

39:49.070 --> 39:51.905
who wasn't even
her real daughter.

39:51.939 --> 39:53.239
Doesn't she love you?

39:53.274 --> 39:55.809
Well, of course she does.

39:55.843 --> 39:58.945
It's-- it's just,
you know, tough love.

39:58.979 --> 40:01.815
"Work on the inside,
not the outside."

40:01.849 --> 40:03.950
You know,
that sort of thing.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.819
That's the face!

40:05.853 --> 40:08.188
Yeah, and then just look
as if your--

40:08.222 --> 40:10.990
Your heart
is about to break.

40:13.260 --> 40:17.097
"Oh, mother,
I just don't understand

40:17.131 --> 40:21.234
why you can't
make me beautiful, too."

40:21.268 --> 40:23.903
- Think it would work?
- Yeah.

40:23.938 --> 40:26.172
I mean, that's what
old Cindy did, right?

40:26.207 --> 40:28.041
And your mother
bibbidi-bobbidi-booed

40:28.075 --> 40:30.143
the living daylights
out of her.

40:30.177 --> 40:34.981
And, hey, if your mom
does decide to, you know,

40:35.015 --> 40:39.119
break out the old wand,
invite me.

40:39.153 --> 40:42.021
If I can convince mom,
you're so there.

40:42.056 --> 40:43.857
Yay.

40:43.891 --> 40:45.225
Bye.

40:45.259 --> 40:46.993
Bye.

40:51.165 --> 40:54.000
Any chance he's in line
for a throne?

40:54.034 --> 40:56.302
Anywhere in line?

40:56.337 --> 40:59.172
Chad. Prince charming, Jr.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.307
Cinderella's son.

41:01.342 --> 41:03.042
Chad inherited the charm,

41:03.077 --> 41:06.079
but not a lot of there
there, know what I mean?

41:07.915 --> 41:10.950
Looks like there
there to me.

41:12.153 --> 41:13.219
Evie.

41:13.254 --> 41:15.889
Perhaps this is just
review for you.

41:15.923 --> 41:20.126
So tell me, what is the average
atomic weight of silver?

41:22.129 --> 41:24.164
Atomic weight?

41:24.198 --> 41:26.199
Uh, well, not very much.

41:26.233 --> 41:29.836
I mean, it's an atom, right?

41:37.912 --> 41:38.912
Let's see.

41:41.148 --> 41:45.919
How do I find the average
atomic weight of silver?

41:45.953 --> 41:50.223
That would be 106.905

41:50.257 --> 41:52.292
times .5200,

41:52.326 --> 41:56.930
plus 108.905

41:56.964 --> 41:59.999
times .4800,

42:00.034 --> 42:02.235
which, Mr. delay,
would give us

42:02.269 --> 42:02.949
107.9 am...

42:08.008 --> 42:10.210
- "Amu"?
- I forget.

42:10.244 --> 42:13.112
- Always a mistake to underestimate...
- A villain?

42:13.147 --> 42:15.949
Don't make it again.

42:38.005 --> 42:41.274
Okay. Carlos,
we're gonna do some sprints.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.842
You ready?

42:42.876 --> 42:45.979
Oh! Ah!

42:46.013 --> 42:48.114
No, wait!

42:48.148 --> 42:50.950
- Sweet!
- No! Ah!

42:52.186 --> 42:54.220
Carlos? Carlos!

42:59.126 --> 43:01.094
No, stop!

43:01.128 --> 43:03.029
- Carlos!
- Ben?

43:03.063 --> 43:04.831
- Ben?
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

43:04.865 --> 43:07.867
Ben, help me!
This thing is a killer!

43:07.901 --> 43:09.836
He's gonna chase me down
and rip out my throat.

43:09.870 --> 43:11.804
This is a vicious,
rabid pack animal!

43:11.839 --> 43:14.107
- Hey, who told you that?
- My mother.

43:14.141 --> 43:17.277
Cruella? -She's a dog expert.
A dog yellerer.

43:17.311 --> 43:20.880
Why are you holding him?
He's gonna attack you!

43:20.914 --> 43:23.816
Carlos, you've never
actually met a dog, have you?

43:23.851 --> 43:27.887
- Of course not.
- Dude, meet Carlos.

43:27.921 --> 43:30.957
Carlos, this is dude.
He's the campus mutt.

43:30.991 --> 43:34.160
He doesn't look like
a vicious, rabid pack animal.

43:37.097 --> 43:39.165
Jeez.

43:39.199 --> 43:42.001
You're a good boy,
aren't you?

43:47.875 --> 43:49.208
You're a good boy.

43:52.179 --> 43:54.180
I guess you guys have it
pretty rough on the island.

43:54.214 --> 43:57.150
Yeah.

43:57.184 --> 44:00.253
Let's just say we don't
get a lot of belly rubs.

44:02.823 --> 44:04.824
Good boy.
I mean, you're a good runner.

44:04.858 --> 44:07.093
- You're-- you're fast, you know.
- Oh. Yeah.

44:07.127 --> 44:08.995
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

44:09.029 --> 44:12.031
Listen, I'm gonna give
you guys some space, yeah?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.233
You guys get to know each other
and just, you know,

44:14.268 --> 44:17.236
- come find me when you're done, okay?
- Okay.

44:17.271 --> 44:20.106
- I'll see you later.
- See you out there.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.848
Hi. Hi.

44:28.882 --> 44:30.883
Oh! Thank you.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.191
Is everybody at home
as pretty as you?

44:38.225 --> 44:42.829
I like to think
I'm the fairest of them all.

44:45.065 --> 44:46.999
How many rooms
in your castle?

44:47.034 --> 44:48.935
Oh! Too many to count.

44:53.340 --> 44:57.009
You really nailed
that chemistry problem today.

44:57.044 --> 44:59.212
You're gonna have all
the nerds in love with you.

44:59.246 --> 45:01.881
- I'm not that smart.
- Oh, come on.

45:01.915 --> 45:04.117
No, really, I'm not.

45:04.151 --> 45:08.121
But I'm-- I'm really good at
sewing and cooking and cleaning.

45:08.155 --> 45:10.156
You know, like your
mother, cinderella,

45:10.190 --> 45:13.092
without the ratty dress.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.260
See this?

45:14.294 --> 45:17.864
If I ask it where
something is, it tells me.

45:17.898 --> 45:19.866
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

45:19.900 --> 45:23.202
Where's my cell phone?

45:23.237 --> 45:25.271
It won't work
for you, silly.

45:27.107 --> 45:29.942
No biggie. My dad will
just get me a new one.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.044
- Prince charming.
- Yeah.

45:32.079 --> 45:34.213
- And cinderella.
- Yeah.

45:34.248 --> 45:36.082
Fairy godmother.

45:37.851 --> 45:41.287
Hey, I heard her wand
is in some boring museum.

45:41.321 --> 45:42.955
Do they always
leave it there?

45:46.093 --> 45:50.229
I'd really like to talk,
but...

45:50.264 --> 45:53.065
I'm just swamped.

45:53.100 --> 45:56.836
- Unless...
- Unless?

45:56.870 --> 45:59.305
If you could knock all my
homework out along with yours,

45:59.339 --> 46:02.842
then maybe we could
get together sometime...

46:02.876 --> 46:06.012
- Hang.
- Okay.

46:07.948 --> 46:09.148
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

46:10.918 --> 46:12.185
Bye.

46:12.219 --> 46:15.121
- I couldn't help but overhear--
- Are you stalking me?

46:15.155 --> 46:18.057
Technically... yes.

46:18.091 --> 46:21.894
I, too, have a fascination
with fairy godmother's wand.

46:21.929 --> 46:24.864
Which is another reason I look
forward to the coronation.

46:24.898 --> 46:28.801
Perhaps we could sit next to each
other and discuss its attributes.

46:31.171 --> 46:33.206
Are you saying they
use it in the coronation?

46:33.240 --> 46:36.876
Yes. And asking you out.

46:43.984 --> 46:47.887
Mom said, "if a boy
can't see the beauty within",

46:47.921 --> 46:50.223
then he's not worth it."
Can you believe it?

46:50.257 --> 46:53.125
- What world does she live in?
- Auradon.

46:53.160 --> 46:57.263
- Mal, do you like?
- Yeah. It's cute.

46:57.297 --> 47:01.100
- It brings out your eyes.
- I know.

47:01.134 --> 47:05.137
- I'll never get a boyfriend.
- Boyfriends are overrated.

47:05.172 --> 47:07.840
And how would you know, mal?
You've never had one.

47:07.875 --> 47:10.209
It's 'cause
I don't need one, e.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.245
They're a waste of time.

47:12.279 --> 47:15.982
I forgot
to do Chad's homework!

47:16.016 --> 47:19.018
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no.

47:19.052 --> 47:22.922
And that is exactly
what I mean.

47:22.956 --> 47:26.092
Hey, guys! I'm Lonnie.

47:26.126 --> 47:27.860
My mom's mulan?

47:29.897 --> 47:33.232
No? Anyways, I love what
you've done with Jane's hair.

47:33.267 --> 47:37.003
And I know you hate us,
and, well, you're evil.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.906
But do you
think you could do mine?

47:39.940 --> 47:42.108
Why would I do that for you?

47:42.142 --> 47:45.144
- I'll pay you 50 dollars.
- Good answer.

47:45.178 --> 47:46.279
I need to buy
more material.

47:46.313 --> 47:50.016
Let's see, I'm thinking,
we lose the bangs,

47:50.050 --> 47:52.285
maybe some layers
and some highlights.

47:52.319 --> 47:55.187
Yeah, yeah.
I want it cool.

47:55.222 --> 47:58.991
- Like mal's.
- Really? The split ends, too?

48:08.802 --> 48:10.770
Okay...

48:14.975 --> 48:19.845
"Beware, forswear, replace
the old with cool hair."

48:34.161 --> 48:36.796
I know. I know.

48:36.830 --> 48:38.831
It looks like a mop
on your head.

48:38.865 --> 48:40.105
You know what?
Let's cut it off,

48:40.167 --> 48:43.035
- layer it--
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

48:43.070 --> 48:45.871
- I love it.
- You do?

48:45.906 --> 48:47.039
It's just...

48:51.044 --> 48:53.879
Now I'm cool.

48:53.914 --> 48:55.181
Like ice.

49:03.256 --> 49:04.924
What did I just do?

49:04.958 --> 49:07.893
Mom's gonna kill me!

49:07.928 --> 49:10.796
I could really use
a tough guy like you.

49:10.831 --> 49:12.991
The team's a bunch of princes,
if you know what I mean.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.168
You're telling me.
It's all, "after you, old chum."

49:16.203 --> 49:19.171
Oh, pardon me,
did I bump into you?"

49:19.206 --> 49:22.942
Where I come from it's,
"prepare to die, sucker!"

49:22.976 --> 49:25.978
As my father says,
"the only way to win"

49:26.013 --> 49:28.848
is to make sure everyone else loses!
Jay!

49:28.882 --> 49:29.949
- Jay, Jay, Jay!
- "You rip--"

49:29.983 --> 49:31.017
let me explain a team.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.019
Uh, it's like a family.

49:33.053 --> 49:36.889
You do not want to be
at my house at dinner time.

49:36.923 --> 49:38.991
Okay, okay, um...

49:39.026 --> 49:41.994
You know how a body has
a lot of different parts?

49:42.029 --> 49:44.163
The legs, elbows, ears.

49:44.197 --> 49:46.932
But they all
need each other.

49:46.967 --> 49:48.134
Well, that's
what a team is--

49:48.168 --> 49:51.904
Different players
who work together to win.

49:51.938 --> 49:53.806
Make any sense?

49:56.076 --> 49:57.143
Can I be the fist?

50:07.154 --> 50:09.989
Yo-ho-ho!

50:10.023 --> 50:11.223
Hey!

50:14.127 --> 50:16.862
Did your plan work with Jane? Are
you going over to see the wand?

50:16.897 --> 50:19.832
Do you think that I would be going
through every single spell in this book

50:19.866 --> 50:21.233
if I hadn't
completely struck out?

50:21.268 --> 50:24.103
- Oh, someone's in a bad mood.
- My mom's counting on me!

50:24.137 --> 50:25.905
I can't let her down!

50:25.939 --> 50:26.906
We can do this...

50:31.078 --> 50:32.178
...if we stick together.

50:33.947 --> 50:38.084
And we won't go back
until we do.

50:38.118 --> 50:39.318
Because we're rotten...

50:39.352 --> 50:42.321
- To the core.
- Oh, yeah.

50:42.355 --> 50:43.956
I found out
that fairy godmother

50:43.990 --> 50:45.224
blesses Ben with the wand
at coronation

50:45.258 --> 50:47.259
and we all get to go.

50:47.294 --> 50:50.029
I have nothing to wear,
of course.

50:52.032 --> 50:54.266
- What?
- Hold that thought.

50:59.106 --> 51:01.941
Hey, mal.
I didn't see you guys today.

51:01.975 --> 51:05.811
I was just wondering if you had
any questions or anything...

51:05.846 --> 51:07.913
That... you needed...

51:07.948 --> 51:10.082
Not that I know of.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.185
Okay. All right.

51:13.220 --> 51:16.055
Well, uh, if you need
anything, just, uh...

51:16.089 --> 51:18.290
Oh, wait!

51:18.325 --> 51:22.027
Um, is it true that we all
get to go to your coronation?

51:22.062 --> 51:25.831
- Yeah, the whole school goes.
- Wow.

51:25.866 --> 51:28.100
That is beyond exciting.

51:28.135 --> 51:30.002
Do you think
that it's a possibility

51:30.036 --> 51:31.303
that the four of us
could stand in the front row

51:31.338 --> 51:33.973
next to the fairy godmother,
just so we could

51:34.007 --> 51:36.108
soak up all that goodness?

51:38.011 --> 51:39.879
I wish you could.

51:39.913 --> 51:42.014
Up front it's just me,

51:42.048 --> 51:43.883
my folks, and my girlfriend.

51:43.917 --> 51:46.051
And your girlfriend?

51:46.086 --> 51:49.855
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- Okay. Thanks, bye.

51:49.890 --> 51:51.157
Oh, but, no,
there's plenty of--

51:53.994 --> 51:55.961
I think it's time

51:55.996 --> 51:59.265
that bennyboo got himself
a new girlfriend.

51:59.299 --> 52:00.966
And I need a love spell.

52:03.069 --> 52:05.237
All right. It says that

52:05.272 --> 52:08.874
we still need one tear,
and I never cry.

52:08.909 --> 52:11.944
- Let's just chop up some onions.
- No.

52:11.978 --> 52:14.880
It says that we need
one tear of human sadness.

52:14.915 --> 52:16.182
And this love potion
gets the best reviews,

52:16.216 --> 52:18.017
so we have to
follow it exactly.

52:18.051 --> 52:20.886
- A tear's a tear.
- That's not true, Jay.

52:20.921 --> 52:22.221
They both have
antibodies and enzymes,

52:22.255 --> 52:25.224
but an emotional tear
has more protein-based hormones

52:25.258 --> 52:29.995
- than a reflex tear.
- Listen to you.

52:30.030 --> 52:32.131
- Yeah, I knew that.
- Did not.

52:32.165 --> 52:33.132
Yeah, I did.

52:34.334 --> 52:37.069
There you are, mal!
I was looking for you.

52:37.103 --> 52:40.906
You know, all the girls
want you to do their hair!

52:40.941 --> 52:43.209
Midnight snack, huh?

52:43.243 --> 52:47.012
What you guys making? -Nothing special.
Just cookies.

52:47.047 --> 52:48.327
- Oh, no, no!
- Wait, wait, wait!

52:49.950 --> 52:53.085
What? I'm not
gonna double dip.

52:54.154 --> 52:55.988
Feel anything?

52:56.022 --> 52:58.924
Yeah, like maybe it
might be missing something?

53:02.829 --> 53:03.796
Hey, there.

53:08.268 --> 53:11.203
- It could use some chips.
- Chips?

53:11.238 --> 53:14.039
And those are...

53:14.074 --> 53:15.975
Chocolate chips.

53:16.009 --> 53:20.045
Just the most
important food group.

53:21.281 --> 53:24.083
Wait, didn't your moms
ever make you guys,

53:24.117 --> 53:26.085
like,
chocolate chip cookies?

53:27.187 --> 53:30.122
Like, when you're
feeling sad,

53:30.156 --> 53:33.926
and they're fresh
from the oven,

53:33.960 --> 53:35.094
with a big
old glass of milk,

53:35.128 --> 53:36.295
and she just
makes you laugh

53:36.329 --> 53:39.064
and puts everything
into perspective and--

53:45.138 --> 53:47.006
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

53:48.308 --> 53:50.943
It's just different
where we're from.

53:52.913 --> 53:56.215
Yeah, I know. I just,
you know, I thought...

53:56.249 --> 53:58.918
Even villains
love their kids.

54:02.055 --> 54:03.222
Oh...

54:10.931 --> 54:12.097
How awful.

54:18.305 --> 54:20.906
Yeah, well, big bummer,

54:20.941 --> 54:22.875
but we have to get
these into the oven,

54:22.909 --> 54:24.043
so thank you so much
for coming by.

54:24.077 --> 54:25.210
Really, really
have a good night.

54:25.245 --> 54:27.146
I'll see you tomorrow.
Evil dreams.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.280
Good night.

54:28.315 --> 54:30.816
See you tomorrow.

54:30.850 --> 54:33.852
Okay, boys, cookie sheet.

54:33.887 --> 54:35.154
- Evie, oven.
- Yes, ma'am.

54:43.997 --> 54:46.131
- Look, it's mal.
- Hi, mal!

54:46.166 --> 54:47.833
Love my hair, mal!

54:51.905 --> 54:53.272
Are you feeling
kind of weird about this?

54:53.306 --> 54:56.842
I mean, it's not
so bad here, you know.

54:56.876 --> 54:58.177
Are you insane?

54:58.211 --> 55:00.879
Long live evil!
You're mean!

55:00.914 --> 55:04.149
You're awful!
You're bad news!

55:04.184 --> 55:06.919
Snap out of it!

55:06.953 --> 55:09.221
Thanks, mal.
I needed that.

55:12.258 --> 55:14.960
Do you think they actually
paid for those? Oh, hello.

55:14.995 --> 55:17.129
The name's Jay.

55:17.163 --> 55:20.099
You all going to the tourney
game tonight? Yeah.

55:20.133 --> 55:22.101
Keep a lookout
for number eight, all right?

55:22.135 --> 55:24.169
- Scoring the winning goal.
- Okay.

55:24.204 --> 55:25.938
She did it
to Jane's hair, too,

55:25.972 --> 55:27.239
and fairy godmother's
not happy about it.

55:27.273 --> 55:30.843
- What's the harm?
- It's gateway magic!

55:30.877 --> 55:32.244
Sure, it starts
with the hair.

55:32.278 --> 55:35.848
Next thing you know
it's the lips and the legs

55:35.882 --> 55:40.085
and the clothes and then everybody looks
good and then... where will I be?

55:40.120 --> 55:42.821
Listen, Audrey--

55:42.856 --> 55:45.824
I will see you at the game after my
dress-fitting for the coronation, okay?

55:45.859 --> 55:49.128
- Okay.
- Bye, bennyboo.

55:49.162 --> 55:50.829
Bye.

55:52.999 --> 55:55.300
- Hey, bennyboo!
- Hey.

55:55.335 --> 55:58.103
I just made
a batch of cookies.

55:58.138 --> 55:59.872
Double chocolate chip,
do you want one?

55:59.906 --> 56:01.774
Oh, I, uh,
I've got a big game.

56:01.808 --> 56:03.008
I don't eat
before a big game.

56:03.043 --> 56:04.977
But thank you so, so much.
Thank you. Next time.

56:05.011 --> 56:06.912
- Next time.
- No, yeah.

56:06.946 --> 56:08.147
I completely understand.

56:08.181 --> 56:10.916
"Be careful of treats offered
by kids of villains."

56:10.950 --> 56:13.185
No, no, no. -No, I'm sure every
kid in auradon knows that.

56:13.219 --> 56:14.987
No, that's not it. No, no, no, i...
I really do...

56:15.021 --> 56:17.790
No, I get it.
You're cautious. That's smart.

56:17.824 --> 56:20.793
Oh, well,
more for me, I guess.

56:20.827 --> 56:23.062
No, no. Hey--

56:23.096 --> 56:25.164
See that?
Totally trust you.

56:25.198 --> 56:27.199
Totally.

56:30.303 --> 56:32.271
- How are they?
- They're good. They're great!

56:32.305 --> 56:35.808
They're amazing!
They're, uh...

56:35.842 --> 56:37.810
I mean, they're chewy
and, and you know, they--

56:37.844 --> 56:40.913
Is that walnuts?
I love walnuts.

56:40.947 --> 56:44.016
I mean, uh,
you know, the...

56:44.050 --> 56:45.250
The chocolate...

56:45.285 --> 56:48.187
The... the chocolate...
The chocolate chips are...

56:48.221 --> 56:51.256
I'm sorry. Um...

56:53.860 --> 56:58.230
Uh, they're...
They're warm and soft.

56:58.264 --> 56:59.998
And they're sweet...

57:02.235 --> 57:05.137
Mal, have you always had those
little golden flecks in your eyes?

57:08.108 --> 57:10.943
How you feeling, bro?

57:10.977 --> 57:13.912
I feel... i feel...

57:13.947 --> 57:16.014
I feel like...

57:16.049 --> 57:18.250
Like singing your name.

57:18.284 --> 57:22.020
♪ Mal, mal ♪

57:26.192 --> 57:28.861
- Ohayohay!
<i>- This is a nail-biter, folks.</i>

57:28.895 --> 57:31.830
<i>There's 47 seconds left on
the clock. We're all tied up.</i>

57:31.865 --> 57:34.233
<i>The Sherwood falcons, two.
The fighting knights, two.</i>

57:34.267 --> 57:37.002
<i>What a game between
auradon's fiercest rivals.</i>

57:37.036 --> 57:39.138
- Get 'em, Chad.
- Thanks, Jay.

57:39.172 --> 57:42.040
<i>The teams get into their huddles and
take up positions along the kill zone.</i>

57:42.075 --> 57:44.209
Akiho! <i>-The dragoneers
have been laying down</i>

57:44.244 --> 57:46.011
<i>- a withering hail of fire.</i>
- You're up.

57:46.045 --> 57:47.246
<i>And now a substitution...</i>

57:47.280 --> 57:49.848
Coach, how about
my buddy here?

57:49.883 --> 57:51.817
- Oh, no.
- Not so sure about that.

57:51.851 --> 57:53.085
- Coach, he's been practicing.
- Jay...

57:53.119 --> 57:55.254
And you said yourself a team
is made up of a bunch of parts.

57:55.288 --> 57:58.891
Jay, I'm not that good. -Well,
he's kind of like my brain.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.126
Come here!

58:02.929 --> 58:04.963
You heard him.
Get out there!

58:04.998 --> 58:06.798
Don't worry, bro.
I got your back.

58:06.833 --> 58:09.968
- How about my front?
- Pfft. Get out there.

58:10.003 --> 58:12.971
<i>He's bringing
that hothead Jay in</i>

58:13.006 --> 58:17.009
<i>from the isle of the lost and that little
guy Carlos can barely hold a shield.</i>

58:17.043 --> 58:18.843
Break! <i>When they break
from their huddles,</i>

58:18.845 --> 58:20.212
<i>this is gonna be
a big moment here.</i>

58:20.246 --> 58:22.948
<i>And the tipoff is ready.</i>

58:22.982 --> 58:24.149
<i>Here we go.</i>

58:24.184 --> 58:26.919
<i>Long pass goes to Jay.</i>

58:26.953 --> 58:28.987
Jay dishes off to prince Ben.

58:30.223 --> 58:31.990
<i>Nice little block by Carlos.</i>

58:32.025 --> 58:34.259
<i>He does a little dancing jig
in his opponent's face.</i>

58:34.294 --> 58:36.862
<i>And now Jay gets the ball back.
Here comes Jay!</i>

58:36.896 --> 58:39.131
<i>Jay, hurdling maneuver
at mid-field.</i>

58:39.165 --> 58:41.099
- I'm open!
<i>- Jay makes a nice pass</i>

58:41.134 --> 58:42.901
<i>to prince Ben
through the kill zone.</i>

58:42.936 --> 58:44.937
- Jay!
- Big block by Chad!

58:44.971 --> 58:47.105
<i>Prince Ben moves over wide,
gives it back to Jay.</i>

58:47.140 --> 58:49.875
<i>He's in the clear! Shot!</i>

58:49.909 --> 58:52.945
Oh, what a save by Philip
the falcons' goalkeeper!

58:52.979 --> 58:54.179
Come on! -All right,
all right, let's do it!

58:54.214 --> 58:56.848
Come on, guys!
Come on, hustle, hustle!

58:56.883 --> 58:59.818
<i>23 seconds left. You could cut
the tension with a sword.</i>

58:59.852 --> 59:01.153
<i>The long ball
is played into Jay.</i>

59:01.187 --> 59:03.989
<i>Jay, great jump, great leap.</i>

59:04.023 --> 59:05.924
<i>And a great move by Jay.</i>

59:05.959 --> 59:07.092
Big block from Chad.

59:07.126 --> 59:09.828
<i>Jay dishes off to prince Ben.</i>

59:09.862 --> 59:12.164
And then Carlos
with a big block, goes down.

59:12.198 --> 59:15.200
<i>Jay through the kill zone,
picks up Carlos.</i>

59:15.235 --> 59:17.836
<i>Oh, he's being hammered by
dragon fire. Still, going on.</i>

59:17.870 --> 59:20.839
<i>Jay, hurdling maneuver at
mid-field. He's in the clear.</i>

59:20.873 --> 59:22.174
<i>The ball goes back to Jay.</i>

59:22.208 --> 59:23.909
- Hey, Jay!
- Carlos?

59:23.943 --> 59:25.777
Go up!

59:25.812 --> 59:27.012
Ben!

59:27.046 --> 59:28.213
<i>He passes to prince Ben.</i>

59:28.248 --> 59:29.815
<i>He scores!</i>

59:33.853 --> 59:35.187
Prince Ben has won it!

59:35.221 --> 59:38.223
<i>What an unselfish play by Jay!</i>

59:38.258 --> 59:41.893
<i>What a team! Incredible!</i>

59:41.928 --> 59:45.030
<i>And it's the new guys,
Jay and Carlos,</i>

59:45.064 --> 59:47.099
<i>who set up the prince
for the win here.</i>

59:47.133 --> 59:50.936
What a victory!
An absolutely wonderful end

59:50.970 --> 59:53.839
<i>to one of the best games ever.</i>

59:53.873 --> 59:56.041
Here they come, folks. The
winners of the first tourn--

59:56.075 --> 59:59.811
Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I
have your attention, please?

01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:06.885
There's something
I'd like to say.

01:00:15.895 --> 01:00:18.897
- Give me an "m"!
- "M"!

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.035
- Give me an "a"!
- "A"!

01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:25.203
- Give me an "I"!
- "L"!

01:00:26.339 --> 01:00:29.941
- What does that spell?
- Mal!

01:00:29.976 --> 01:00:32.210
- Come on, I can't hear you!
- Mal!

01:00:32.245 --> 01:00:34.846
I love you, mal!
Did I mention that?

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:38.250
Oh...

01:00:38.284 --> 01:00:41.053

- Hey!

01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:21.913
And I'm going
to the coronation with him.

01:03:21.948 --> 01:03:24.816
So I don't need
your pity date.

01:03:24.851 --> 01:03:27.219
Whoa! Mal! Will you go to
the coronation with me?

01:03:27.253 --> 01:03:31.189
- Yes!
- She said yes!

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:34.092
Let's go, Ben.

01:03:34.126 --> 01:03:36.027
The whole team's
waiting for you.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.295
- Yeah.
- Bye.

01:03:39.165 --> 01:03:41.299
Whoo!

01:03:41.334 --> 01:03:42.834
<i>What a victory.</i>

01:03:42.869 --> 01:03:45.003
<i>What a day
for the auradon knights,</i>

01:03:45.037 --> 01:03:48.039
<i>finally winning back the
trophy after so many years.</i>

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.142
- I feel really sorry for Audrey.
- You do?

01:03:51.177 --> 01:03:54.012
Yeah.

01:03:54.046 --> 01:03:56.147
I feel like if she
were talented like you,

01:03:56.182 --> 01:03:59.918
and she knew how
to sew and knew beauty tips,

01:03:59.952 --> 01:04:02.713
that she wouldn't need a prince to
make her feel better about herself.

01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:04.990
I guess I am
kind of talented.

01:04:05.024 --> 01:04:07.259
You are definitely gifted.

01:04:07.293 --> 01:04:09.060
- Thanks, m.
- Yeah, yeah!

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:12.097
<i>And there he is.</i>

01:04:12.131 --> 01:04:14.266
<i>Jay, the most valuable player.</i>

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.168
<i>How do you like that?</i>

01:04:17.203 --> 01:04:20.171
Hey!

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.145
Looking for something?

01:04:32.084 --> 01:04:33.885
Thank you, Chad.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.856
It's gratifying to see someone
still respects the honor code.

01:04:39.058 --> 01:04:42.027
It will be my recommendation
that you are expelled.

01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:43.962
- Mr. delay, I--
- But that isn't fair.

01:04:43.996 --> 01:04:45.997
Obviously she wasn't cheating
since she didn't have that...

01:04:46.032 --> 01:04:48.133
- Whatever it is.
- It's called a magic mir--

01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:51.036
You're not helping. Stop. Maybe
she needed another pencil.

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:54.005
- Actually, I was--
- Really, don't help.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.074
- Please.
- Please.

01:04:56.108 --> 01:04:57.309
Well, if you can
pass this test,

01:04:57.343 --> 01:05:00.045
I'll return your property
and let the matter drop.

01:05:15.294 --> 01:05:20.165
For the first time, it's like I'm
more than just a pretty face.

01:05:20.199 --> 01:05:22.167
A shocker, huh?

01:05:24.136 --> 01:05:25.837
You were pretty
great in there.

01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:28.840
So were you.

01:05:28.874 --> 01:05:31.943
I bet I can get an "a" on the
next test without the mirror.

01:05:31.978 --> 01:05:34.045
Yeah. Well, maybe we can get
together and we'll hang out with--

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.815
- Yeah, let's get together.
- There you are!

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:40.018
I have been looking for you
literally everywhere! -What's wrong?

01:05:40.052 --> 01:05:41.920
Ben just asked me out on...

01:05:44.323 --> 01:05:47.125
- ...a date.
- Nice.

01:05:47.159 --> 01:05:50.228
- We can handle this. Bye.
- Bye.

01:05:50.262 --> 01:05:52.931
- You're looking a little pale.
- Yeah, of course.

01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:55.100
I can fix that with some
gloss and some blush. -No!

01:05:55.134 --> 01:05:57.836
- Mal, I can use the...
- No, no, no.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:10.982
Okay. Easy on the blush.

01:06:11.017 --> 01:06:12.584
I don't want to scare him away.

01:06:12.618 --> 01:06:14.753
Not that I could.

01:06:14.787 --> 01:06:18.923
Please. My mom taught me how to
apply blush before I could talk.

01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:21.826
Always use upward strokes.

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:28.033
My mom was never really big
on makeup tips.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:30.935
- I never had a sister.
- Well, now you do.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:33.770
We're going to need all the family we
can get if we don't pull this off.

01:06:33.773 --> 01:06:36.775
My mother's not a barrel of laughs
when she doesn't get her way.

01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:37.842
Just ask snow white.

01:06:39.712 --> 01:06:42.847
- Are you afraid of her?
- Sometimes.

01:06:42.882 --> 01:06:45.984
Are you afraid of your mom?

01:06:46.018 --> 01:06:49.921
I just really want her
to be proud of me.

01:06:49.955 --> 01:06:53.591
She gets so angry with me
when I disappoint her.

01:06:55.628 --> 01:06:59.564
And sh-- yeah, she's my mom,
so I know she loves me...

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:01.766
In her own way.

01:07:04.637 --> 01:07:05.870
Moving on. Come see.

01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:07.872
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

01:07:12.878 --> 01:07:16.781
- Oh.
- I know.

01:07:16.816 --> 01:07:19.918
- I look...
- Say it.

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:24.589
- Not hideous.
- Not even close.

01:07:39.004 --> 01:07:40.872
For the first time,
I understand the difference

01:07:40.906 --> 01:07:42.707
between pretty and beautiful.

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:46.044
I hope you like bikes.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:26.751
Tell me something about yourself
that you've never told anyone.

01:08:26.786 --> 01:08:31.555
Um...
My middle name is Bertha.

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:33.957
- Bertha?
- Yeah.

01:08:33.993 --> 01:08:36.828
Bertha. Just my mom doing
what she does best.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:42.567
Being really, really evil.
Mal Bertha.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.937
- Mine's florian.
- Florian?

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:48.640
- Yeah.
- How princely.

01:08:48.674 --> 01:08:51.676
Oh, that's almost worse. I mean,
you know, it's better than Bertha.

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:55.013
But it's still not--
Watch your foot. Yeah.

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:56.981
- Are you good?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:57.015 --> 01:08:59.651
Now, step up.
There you go.

01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:03.921
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:05.758 --> 01:09:06.957
Open.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.701
Go on.

01:09:22.675 --> 01:09:24.742
Mm...

01:09:24.777 --> 01:09:28.846
- Is this your first time?
- Mm...

01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:33.917
We don't really date
much on the island.

01:09:33.953 --> 01:09:37.788
It's more like...
Gang activity.

01:09:37.823 --> 01:09:39.924
Um, I meant,

01:09:39.959 --> 01:09:42.694
is this your first time
eating a jelly donut?

01:09:42.728 --> 01:09:44.796
Is it bad?

01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:46.831
You got a...

01:09:46.866 --> 01:09:48.666
Just a...

01:09:48.701 --> 01:09:50.835
- I mean, yeah, do this.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:53.037
Gone?

01:09:53.072 --> 01:09:55.807
You can't take me
anywhere, I guess.

01:09:55.841 --> 01:09:58.743
You know, I've done all
the talking. Your turn.

01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:01.846
I really don't know
that much about you.

01:10:01.881 --> 01:10:03.781
Tell me something.

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:09.721
Well, I'm 16.

01:10:09.755 --> 01:10:11.656
I'm an only child.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.992
And I've only ever
lived in one place.

01:10:14.026 --> 01:10:16.060
Me, too. That-- we have
so much in common already.

01:10:16.095 --> 01:10:20.598
No.
Trust me, we do not.

01:10:23.002 --> 01:10:24.869
And now you're
gonna be king.

01:10:24.904 --> 01:10:27.639
- Yeah.
- What?

01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:32.010
A crown doesn't
make you a king.

01:10:32.044 --> 01:10:35.747
Well, it kind of does.

01:10:35.781 --> 01:10:38.716
No, it...

01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:40.084
Your mother
is mistress of evil

01:10:40.119 --> 01:10:43.655
and I've got the poster parents
for goodness.

01:10:45.124 --> 01:10:47.825
But we're not
automatically like them.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.962
We get to choose
who we're gonna be.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:53.698
And right now,

01:10:53.732 --> 01:10:57.035
I can look into your eyes and
I can tell you're not evil.

01:10:57.069 --> 01:10:58.703
I can see it.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.711
- Let's go for a swim.
- Hm? What? Uh...

01:11:06.745 --> 01:11:08.813
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:10.715
I think
I'm just gonna stay here.

01:11:10.749 --> 01:11:11.749
No, no, no. Come on.

01:11:11.784 --> 01:11:13.051
I think I'm gonna stay behind

01:11:13.085 --> 01:11:14.786
and try a strawberry.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.888
I've literally never tried
a strawberry before.

01:11:16.922 --> 01:11:20.758
Mm! Mm...

01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:22.794
don't eat all of them.

01:11:22.828 --> 01:11:24.595
Okay.

01:11:25.798 --> 01:11:28.733
Ooh!

01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:30.034
Mm.

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:45.883
Are those little crowns
on your shorts?

01:11:47.753 --> 01:11:48.987
Maybe.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:59.897

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.616
Ben!

01:14:51.803 --> 01:14:55.006
Ugh!

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.774
You scared me!

01:14:56.808 --> 01:14:58.809
- You-- you can't swim?
- No!

01:14:58.844 --> 01:15:02.780
You live on an island! -Yeah, with
a barrier around it, remember?

01:15:02.814 --> 01:15:05.850
Ugh! -And you still
tried to save me.

01:15:05.884 --> 01:15:08.853
Yeah.
And do you thank me? No!

01:15:08.887 --> 01:15:11.589
All I get is soaking wet!

01:15:11.623 --> 01:15:15.893
And, uh, this fancy rock.

01:15:16.962 --> 01:15:18.563
It's yours.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.631
Make a wish and throw it
back in the lake.

01:15:28.073 --> 01:15:29.874
What...

01:15:49.761 --> 01:15:51.762
Uh, mal...

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.698
I told you that I loved you.

01:15:57.769 --> 01:15:59.003
What about you?

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:03.007
Do you love me?

01:16:12.851 --> 01:16:15.553
I don't know
what love feels like.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.865
Maybe I can teach you.

01:16:36.642 --> 01:16:38.609
Children, excuse me.

01:16:38.644 --> 01:16:40.745
Um, as you know, uh,

01:16:40.779 --> 01:16:43.948
this Sunday is family day
here at auradon prep.

01:16:43.982 --> 01:16:47.585
And because your parents
can't be here due to,

01:16:47.619 --> 01:16:49.920
uh, distance,

01:16:49.955 --> 01:16:53.858
we've arranged
for a special treat.

01:16:58.764 --> 01:17:01.966
I don't see anything,
nor do I hear.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.834
- Kids!
<i>- Is it--</i>

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:06.003
- Is it-- is--
- Press enter.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.773
Can I please see a remote?
Is this thing on?

01:17:08.807 --> 01:17:10.541
- Ugh, it's broken.
- Ugh!

01:17:10.575 --> 01:17:11.876
I hate electronic equip--

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:15.946
- Oh!
- Evie, it's mommy. Oh!

01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:19.550
Look how beautiful.
Oh, you know what they say,

01:17:19.584 --> 01:17:21.819
the poison apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

01:17:21.853 --> 01:17:25.723
- Don't you mean the weeds?
- Ooh! Who's the old bat?

01:17:25.757 --> 01:17:28.592
This is fairy godmother.

01:17:28.627 --> 01:17:31.562
Still doing tricks
with eggplants?

01:17:31.596 --> 01:17:34.732
I turned a pumpkin
into a beautiful carriage.

01:17:34.766 --> 01:17:38.969
You really couldn't give cinderella
till one A.M.? I mean, really.

01:17:39.004 --> 01:17:42.707
What, the hamsters had to be
back on their little wheels?

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.810
They were mice! They were
not-- they were mice.

01:17:45.844 --> 01:17:47.778
They were not-- -thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:17:47.813 --> 01:17:49.580
- They were mice.
- Hi, mom.

01:17:49.614 --> 01:17:50.648
Mal!

01:17:50.682 --> 01:17:53.818
I m-m-miss you.

01:17:53.852 --> 01:17:55.753
You children are never
far from our thoughts.

01:17:55.787 --> 01:17:56.854
I got it.

01:17:56.888 --> 01:17:58.956
How long must mommy
wait to see you?

01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:00.958
Um, there's a big coronation
coming up.

01:18:00.992 --> 01:18:03.828
I think sometime probably
after... that.

01:18:03.862 --> 01:18:06.564
- When?
- Friday, 10 A.M.

01:18:06.598 --> 01:18:08.899
You sure I can't
see you before that?

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:12.803
I don't know what I'll do if I don't
get my hands on that magic wan--

01:18:12.838 --> 01:18:16.574
You... you little nugget
that I love so much.

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:19.677
Yes, I completely
understand, mother.

01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:22.813
Carlos, is that a dog?

01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:26.951
Oh, yes, yes,
baby, I do understand.

01:18:26.985 --> 01:18:29.987
It would make the perfect
size for earmuffs.

01:18:30.021 --> 01:18:32.757
He's the perfect size
for a pet.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:36.026
Oh! -This dog loves
me, and I love him.

01:18:36.061 --> 01:18:39.630
- And fyi, your dog is stuffed!
- Oh!

01:18:39.664 --> 01:18:44.568
- So give it a rest!
- Oh-ho! Burn!

01:18:44.603 --> 01:18:47.705
Oh! Why don't you go sell a
toaster, you two-bit salesman!

01:18:47.739 --> 01:18:50.641
People who talk to stuffed
animals shouldn't throw stones.

01:18:50.675 --> 01:18:53.577
<i>Oh, well, people who sell toasters
shouldn't use mixed metaphors.</i>

01:18:53.612 --> 01:18:54.845
Enough!

01:18:55.914 --> 01:18:58.048
I'm so sorry.

01:18:58.083 --> 01:19:02.520
- Thanks for the special treat.
- Of course.

01:19:06.758 --> 01:19:08.893
M?

01:19:08.927 --> 01:19:10.694
What do you think our parents
are gonna do to us

01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:13.531
if we don't pull this off?

01:19:13.565 --> 01:19:17.802
I think they will be
quietly disappointed in us,

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:20.604
but ultimately...

01:19:20.639 --> 01:19:22.873
Proud of us
for doing our best.

01:19:22.908 --> 01:19:24.542
Really?

01:19:24.576 --> 01:19:26.977
No, I think we
are definitely goners.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.879
Yeah.

01:19:32.651 --> 01:19:34.785
Okay, we all know
what this looks like.

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.588
So it'll be up on the dais
under the beast's spell jar,

01:19:37.622 --> 01:19:38.956
and we'll be
coming in from here.

01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:40.758
I will be in the very front.

01:19:40.792 --> 01:19:41.892
You all will be up
in the balcony.

01:19:41.927 --> 01:19:43.894
- Okay.
- Carlos?

01:19:43.929 --> 01:19:46.797
Okay, so I'll find our limo,
so we can break the barrier,

01:19:46.832 --> 01:19:48.666
and, uh, get back on the
island with the wand.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.569
- Perfect. Evie?
- Yeah?

01:19:51.603 --> 01:19:52.903
You will use this
to take out the driver.

01:19:52.938 --> 01:19:54.905
Two sprays and he'll
be out like a light.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.940
Okay.

01:20:08.787 --> 01:20:10.721
M?

01:20:10.789 --> 01:20:12.590
You want to break
Ben's love spell?

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.760
Yeah.

01:20:16.795 --> 01:20:18.596
You know, for after.

01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:20.064
I don't...

01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:25.002
I've just been thinking,
you know,

01:20:25.036 --> 01:20:27.605
when the villains
finally do invade auradon,

01:20:27.639 --> 01:20:30.007
and begin to loot

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:31.942
and kick everyone
out of their castles

01:20:31.977 --> 01:20:34.612
and imprison their leaders

01:20:34.646 --> 01:20:36.747
and destroy all that is
good and beautiful,

01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:40.651
Ben still being in love with me
just seems a little extra...

01:20:42.821 --> 01:20:43.787
...cruel.

- Oh. Wa--

01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:47.705
Mm.

01:23:53.978 --> 01:23:56.647
- Just here?
- Ready?

01:23:57.916 --> 01:23:59.950
Oh, by the way,
I have a new girlfriend.

01:23:59.984 --> 01:24:01.719
- Oh!
- Yeah.

01:24:01.753 --> 01:24:02.953
Well, I never
wanted to say anything,

01:24:02.987 --> 01:24:05.589
but I always thought that Audrey
was a little self-absorbed.

01:24:05.623 --> 01:24:07.658
A fake smile,
kind of a kiss-up.

01:24:07.692 --> 01:24:08.892
Do we know your
new girlfriend?

01:24:08.927 --> 01:24:11.795
On the count of three.
One, two...

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:12.963
Well, sort of. Mal!

01:24:12.997 --> 01:24:15.599
I gotta go, okay?

01:24:15.633 --> 01:24:16.834
- Three!
- Huh?

01:24:19.637 --> 01:24:21.705
- Mal? Mal.
- Uh...

01:24:22.974 --> 01:24:24.842
I wanna introduce
you to my parents.

01:24:24.876 --> 01:24:27.778
Ben.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.782
This is mal.
From the island.

01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:33.617
- Mm...
- My girlfriend.

01:24:33.651 --> 01:24:35.686
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:37.722 --> 01:24:38.989
I was thinking maybe
she can join us for lunch.

01:24:39.023 --> 01:24:40.891
Of... course.

01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:42.025
Any friend of Ben's...

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.828
Um, I actually came
with my friends.

01:24:44.863 --> 01:24:46.797
Well, you should invite them.

01:24:49.067 --> 01:24:52.603
- Because the more the merrier!
- Yeah, I'll go grab them.

01:24:52.637 --> 01:24:54.772
Uh, how about a game
of croquet before lunch?

01:24:54.806 --> 01:24:56.607
- Huh? Of course.
- Game on.

01:24:56.641 --> 01:24:58.942
Game on.

01:24:58.977 --> 01:24:59.977
- Have you played before?
- No.

01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:01.745
No? You'll be fine.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.747
Whoa.

01:25:03.782 --> 01:25:04.915
Come on, dude.

01:25:04.949 --> 01:25:06.650
- Here, stand up.
- Come on, dude.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:07.718
Stand here.

01:25:07.752 --> 01:25:08.872
Hey, get them!
Hey, get them!

01:25:08.887 --> 01:25:10.721
Nice!

01:25:10.755 --> 01:25:14.725
- Hello there.
- Hi.

01:25:14.759 --> 01:25:17.761
Now, have we met?

01:25:17.796 --> 01:25:20.030
No, I don't think so.
I'm new.

01:25:20.064 --> 01:25:21.899
I'm sort of like a...
Transfer student.

01:25:21.933 --> 01:25:23.834
- Oh, yes.
- Grammy.

01:25:23.868 --> 01:25:27.004
Oh, Audrey!
Give grammy a kiss, dear.

01:25:28.773 --> 01:25:31.875
- "Grammy"?
- Sleeping beauty's mother.

01:25:33.645 --> 01:25:35.045
Grammy, I don't think you want
to be talking to this girl.

01:25:35.079 --> 01:25:38.849
Unless you feel like taking
another hundred-year nap.

01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:39.850
What?

01:25:42.787 --> 01:25:43.987
You!

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.594
How are you here?

01:25:51.696 --> 01:25:54.698
And how have you
stayed so young?

01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:57.668
Queen Leah, it's okay. Maleficent
is still on the island.

01:25:57.702 --> 01:25:59.636
This is her daughter, mal.

01:25:59.671 --> 01:26:01.972
Don't you remember my proclamation
to give the new generation a chance?

01:26:02.006 --> 01:26:04.942
A chance to what, Ben?
Destroy us?

01:26:06.778 --> 01:26:08.779
Come on.
You remember, don't you?

01:26:08.813 --> 01:26:12.583
The poison apples.
And the spells.

01:26:13.785 --> 01:26:14.885
Spells.

01:26:16.054 --> 01:26:18.689
My daughter...

01:26:18.723 --> 01:26:20.757
Was raised by fairies

01:26:20.792 --> 01:26:23.827
because of
your mother's curse.

01:26:23.862 --> 01:26:27.664
So her first words,
her first steps,

01:26:27.699 --> 01:26:30.667
I missed it all!

01:26:33.671 --> 01:26:35.572
- You mustn't trust her.
- I'm so so--

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:36.740
Go away! Stay away from her!

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:40.644
- Don't do this, Chad.
- What?

01:26:40.678 --> 01:26:42.613
They were raised
by their parents, Ben.

01:26:42.647 --> 01:26:44.948
What do you think villains
teach their kids? Huh?

01:26:44.983 --> 01:26:48.719
Kindness? Fair play?
No way, okay? Uh-uh.

01:26:48.753 --> 01:26:50.721
You stole another
girl's boyfriend.

01:26:50.755 --> 01:26:54.925
- Hey, hey!
- Oh. You enjoy hurting people.

01:26:54.959 --> 01:27:00.530
And you, you're nothing but a
gold digger and a cheater.

01:27:00.565 --> 01:27:01.965
Mirror, mirror, in my hand,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.668
who's the biggest
jerk in the land?

01:27:04.702 --> 01:27:06.904
What? Come on!

01:27:06.938 --> 01:27:08.739
Back off, Chad. All right?

01:27:08.773 --> 01:27:10.774
- Back off!
- Chad!

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:13.777
Chad? Chad!
Evie did something to Chad!

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:15.946
- Wake up.
- Check if he's okay.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.749
Come on, mal.

01:27:18.783 --> 01:27:20.817
- Guys!
- Jay!

01:27:20.852 --> 01:27:21.952
Chad, wake up!

01:27:24.055 --> 01:27:25.589
Come on, Chad.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:30.627
I feared something
like this would happen.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:33.563
- This isn't their fault!
- No, son.

01:27:34.732 --> 01:27:35.766
It's yours.

01:27:40.772 --> 01:27:42.606
Mom?

01:27:50.815 --> 01:27:54.651
What happened?
I had this dream...

01:28:08.566 --> 01:28:10.801
Hey, guys.
How is everyone?

01:28:10.835 --> 01:28:13.537
Yeah?

01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:15.639
Hey, listen.
Forget about it. All right?

01:28:15.673 --> 01:28:18.742
It was nothing.
Forget about it. Let it go.

01:28:18.776 --> 01:28:21.376
Tomorrow, after the coronation, I
promise everything will be okay.

01:28:23.848 --> 01:28:24.848
I have to go.

01:28:27.919 --> 01:28:28.952
I'll see you guys later.

01:28:32.957 --> 01:28:36.660
Listen, Evie, I wanna talk about
earlier today. I just-- -Doug!

01:28:36.694 --> 01:28:37.995
- It's my fault, Doug. I'm sorry.
- No, it's mine.

01:28:38.029 --> 01:28:39.830
- Doug!
- What?

01:28:41.032 --> 01:28:44.735
- Doug...
- Sorry, I can't.

01:28:44.769 --> 01:28:47.704
Okay.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:50.574
How long does she
think that's gonna last?

01:28:50.608 --> 01:28:53.944
Mal is just the bad girl infatuation.
Yeah.

01:28:53.978 --> 01:28:56.747
I mean, he's never gonna
make a villain a queen.

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:06.556
Beware, forswear,
undo Jane's hair.

01:29:10.028 --> 01:29:11.995
Ew!

01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:13.864
There's a lot more
where that came from.

01:29:13.898 --> 01:29:15.766
Excuse me,
who do you think you are?

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.967
Do I look like I'm kidding?

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:28.812
I'm really looking
forward to tomorrow.

01:29:30.915 --> 01:29:33.850
Let's grab that wand
and blow this popsicle stand.

01:29:41.759 --> 01:29:43.560
<i>♪ I'm rotten to the core. ♪</i>

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.450

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:52.019
<i>broadcasting live

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.355
<i>where prince Benjamin

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:58.192
I'm snow white, bringing you
up to the second coverage

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.060
of who's the fairest
of them all.

01:30:00.095 --> 01:30:02.129
"I'm snow white."
Who are you kidding?

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:04.365
She's definitely
had work done.

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:16.276
Oh.

01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:20.280
Oh, me?

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:24.418
Oh, fairy godmother
is looking radiant.

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:28.489
<i>But what is happening
with Jane's hair?</i>

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:32.359
<i>And there
is fairy godmother's wand.</i>

01:30:32.394 --> 01:30:37.031
- I want that wand!
- Do you? Hadn't heard.

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:39.199
<i>Oh,
and here comes Ben now.</i>

01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:50.144
Don't be nervous.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:53.247
All you have to do is sit there
and look beautiful.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:57.518
- No problem there.
- Thank you.

01:30:57.552 --> 01:31:00.187
Mal, would you wear my ring?

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:03.090
Um... not now.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:06.093
I think it would probably
just fall right off of me.

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:10.397
- I have something for you.
- For me?

01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:11.432
Yeah.

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:13.333
It's just for later, you know,

01:31:13.368 --> 01:31:15.302
when you need strength.

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:17.204
Some carbs
to keep up your energy.

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.206
Always thinking.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.375
But I can't wait.

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:24.178
- No!
- Mm. Mm...

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:25.446
Mm! This is really good.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.382
- Uh, do you--
- Mal?

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:31.118
- Do you feel okay?
- You bet.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:35.189
Would you say
that you're still in-- that--

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:38.225
That you have very strong
feelings for me?

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:39.326
I'm not sure.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.096
I mean, let's give
the anti-love potion

01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:43.197
a few minutes to take effect.

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:45.199
- Yeah...
- Okay.

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.235
What?

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:50.104
What? You knew?

01:31:50.138 --> 01:31:52.473
That you spelled me? Yeah.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:54.475
- Yeah, I knew.
- I'm-- I can explain myself.

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:58.145
No, look, it's fine. I mean, you had
a crush on me. I was with Audrey.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:59.446
You didn't trust that it
could happen on its own.

01:31:59.481 --> 01:32:02.216
- Am I right?
- Yes.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.017
You're so right.

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:07.187
So, then,
how long have you known?

01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:09.256
Since our first date.

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:11.258
Your spell washed away
in the enchanted lake.

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:15.229
So then what?
You've just been...

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:16.997
Faking it since then?

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:27.441
I haven't been
faking anything.

01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:46.126
- Well, if it isn't--
- My daughter.

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:49.029
- Looking like some kind of...
- Princess!

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:52.366
<i>Now, let's see
who this beauty is wearing.</i>

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.103
- Evie.
- Evie! That's my dau-- Evie!

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:59.273
Someone named Evie
designed her gown.

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:01.441
- That's my daughter!
- Oh, wow. She sewed a dress.

01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:03.177
Meanwhile,
my girl duped a prince,

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:04.978
and she's this close
to grabbing the magic wand.

01:33:05.013 --> 01:33:07.114
Bitter, party of one.
Bitter, party of one.

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.348
It's happening, people!

01:33:08.383 --> 01:33:11.118
It's happening!
I say, gird your loins!

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:13.086
Gird your loins!

01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:15.289
Villains,
our revenge begins today.

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:34.074
About the other day,
I just--

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:36.210
I told Ben this
wasn't going to be easy.

01:33:36.244 --> 01:33:38.345
You also taught me that a king
has to believe in himself.

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.414
- Even when it isn't easy.
- I did?

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:44.451
I... how very wise of me.

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:48.188
Ben, we are very
proud of you.

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:50.490
- You keep listening to your heart.
- Thanks, mom.

01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:54.428
You're gonna make
a fine king.

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:08.342
Wish me luck.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:18.045
Don't blow it, kiddo.

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.029
Do you solemnly swear

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.303
to govern
the peoples of auradon

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:14.368
with justice and mercy
as long as you shall reign?

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:18.138
Oh, grab the thing already!

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:20.440
I do solemnly swear.

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:26.146
Then it is my honor and my joy

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.382
to bless our new king.

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.152
- Yes!
- Oh!

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:33.987
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:42.229
Oh!

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:50.170
The barrier is broken!
We're free!

01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:57.277
Scepter! Now!

01:37:08.089 --> 01:37:09.289
Child, what are you doing?!

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.283
If you won't make me beautiful,
I'll do it myself!

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.362
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:17.264
Take cover!

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:22.269
Careful, mal!

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:32.446
- Mal, give me the wand.
- Stand back.

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:37.083
- It's okay.
- Ben, I said stand back!

01:37:37.118 --> 01:37:39.386
I told you so!

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:43.223
- Let's go!
- Revenge time.

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:47.060
- You really want to do this?
- We have no choice, Ben!

01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:50.163
Our parents-- -your
parents made their choice.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.998
Now you make yours.

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:04.978
I think I want to be good.

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:07.080
- You are good.
- How do you know that?

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:08.982
Because...

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:10.383
Because I'm listening
to my heart.

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:18.425
I want to listen
to my heart, too.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:26.199
And my heart is telling me
that we are not our parents.

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:32.038
I mean, stealing things
doesn't make you happy.

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:35.242
Tourney and victory pizza
with the team makes you happy.

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:37.043
Yeah!

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:40.447
And you, scratching dude's
belly makes you happy.

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:42.382
Who would've thought?

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:46.253
And Evie...

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:49.055
You do not have to play dumb
to get a guy.

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:52.292
You are so smart.

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:55.328
And I don't want to take
over the world with evil.

01:38:55.363 --> 01:38:58.298
It doesn't make me happy.

01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:00.200
I want to go to school.

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:04.337
And be with Ben.

01:39:07.074 --> 01:39:10.377
Because Ben
makes me really happy.

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:17.384
Us being friends
makes me really happy.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.254
Not destroying things.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:27.060
I choose good, you guys.

01:39:34.168 --> 01:39:36.336
I choose good, too.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.375
I choose good.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:46.346
So, just to be clear,

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.215
we don't have to be worried
about how really mad

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.418
our parents will be?

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:54.120
Because they're gonna
be really, really mad.

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:56.056
Your parents
can't reach you here.

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:02.329
Okay, then. Good.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:07.300
Come on.

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:31.391
- I'm back!
- It can't be.

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.361
Go away, mother.

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:38.098
- She's funny.
- Oh!

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:42.302
I'm so-- you're very funny.
Here.

01:40:42.336 --> 01:40:44.137
Wand me. Chop chop.

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:46.373
No!

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:49.142
- Bibbidi-bobbidi--
- Boo.

01:40:56.450 --> 01:41:00.320
Psych.

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:03.423
Ooh.

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:07.227
Ooh, in another time,
in another time.

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:11.998
♪ Evil like me,
don't you wanna be mean... ♪

01:41:12.033 --> 01:41:13.233
Ow!

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.401
Oh. Oh, no.

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:19.205
Someone needs to pluck
their nose hairs.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.142
Where shall we begin?

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:24.110
I know.

01:41:24.145 --> 01:41:26.312
Why don't we start
by getting rid of this?

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.216
Perfect fit!

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:33.219
Oh, excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:34.354
The horns, the horns!

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:38.024
Aw...

01:41:38.059 --> 01:41:39.392
Falling in love is weak...

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:43.463
And ridiculous.

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:46.399
- It's not what you want.
- You don't know what I want!

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:53.206
Mom, have you ever once
asked me what I want?

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.375
- I'm not you!
- Oh, obviously.

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:57.343
I've had years and years
and years and...

01:41:57.378 --> 01:42:00.246
Years of practice being evil.
You'll get there.

01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:01.381
No, I will not.

01:42:03.084 --> 01:42:05.051
And I really wish that you

01:42:05.086 --> 01:42:07.087
had never gotten
there yourself.

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:13.259
Love is not weak
or ridiculous.

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:15.428
It's actually really amazing.

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:18.131
I know one thing,
young lady.

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:20.400
You have no room for love
in your life!

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:24.404
And now I command,
wand to my hand!

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:30.343
Ha! It worked!

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:34.280
I hardly think so. Frankly, this
is tedious and very immature.

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:36.149
Give me the wand.
Give me the wand!

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:39.119
Hold on, mal. Maybe good really
is more powerful than evil.

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:42.222
Oh, please!
You're killing me. Arf!

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:46.259
Oh! Oh, the breath!

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:51.164
The breath! Get off me!

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:55.268
Gaston should be jealous.

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:59.405
Enough!

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.978
You all will regret this!

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:18.158
Come on.
Run, Jay, run!

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.466
Hurry, Jay.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.368
- Jay!
- Watch it, Jay!

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:32.138
Jay, come on!
Please, Jay! Jay!

01:43:32.173 --> 01:43:34.207
Aah!

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:36.409
Magic mirror,
show your bright light!

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:43.149
Behind me, e!
Leave my friends alone!

01:43:45.486 --> 01:43:48.121
This is between
you and me, mother.

01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:54.360
The strength of evil
is good as none,

01:43:54.395 --> 01:43:56.462
when stands before
four hearts as one.

01:43:56.497 --> 01:44:00.300
The strength of evil
is good as none,

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:03.136
when stands before
four hearts as one.

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:05.438
The strength of evil
is good as none,

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:09.175
when stands before
four hearts as one!

01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:28.027
Oh!

01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:32.265
- What just happened?
- I have no idea.

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:33.399
- Did you do it?
- I don't know.

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:36.236
No, no, no, no.
Your mother did.

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:39.472
She shrank to the size
of the love in her heart.

01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:42.242
That's why it's so itty-bitty.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.477
Is she gonna
be like that forever?

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:47.380
Well, forever is a long time.

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:50.116
You learned to love.

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:51.351
So can she.

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:55.488
I believe this belongs to you.

01:44:57.324 --> 01:45:00.326
And I believe this...

01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:02.161
Belongs to you.

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:08.067
You all have earned yourselves
an "a" in goodness class.

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:13.239
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

01:45:13.274 --> 01:45:16.142
Okay, okay! Oh!

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.977
We kinda got this
all wrapped up here.

01:45:18.012 --> 01:45:21.047
- Oh...
- Yeah, let's go.

01:45:24.218 --> 01:45:27.320
Oh!

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:31.190
- Next time, I rescue you, okay?
- Yeah.

01:45:31.225 --> 01:45:33.026
Let's not let there
be a next time, okay?

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:41.367
I will be right back.

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.105
I love you.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.374
But you are on
a major time-out.

01:45:48.409 --> 01:45:51.344
Don't be too hard on Jane.

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:55.348
I was the one who put all
that crazy stuff in her head.

01:45:58.118 --> 01:46:00.353
You are beautiful...

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:05.258
Inside and out.
