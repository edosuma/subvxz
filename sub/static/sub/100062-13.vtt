WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:09.310
Mmm!

00:09.343 --> 00:10.811
Really, Dad?
Another burger?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.146
Whoa!

00:12.180 --> 00:14.148
You gonna take that
from your own kid, Lou?

00:14.182 --> 00:16.417
Come on, fight back.
Make fun of his hands.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.053
No, we've just been eating a lot
of burgers together lately.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.854
We formed a club,
the Burger Boys.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.556
Whenever a place has
the balls to advertise

00:22.590 --> 00:24.058
the "Best Burger
in Orlando,"

00:24.092 --> 00:26.227
it's the Burger Boys' job
to put it to the test.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.930
It's been a really fun way to
hang out with two of my sons.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.599
Food is just brain-fuel.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.267
My girlfriend Sicily
makes nutrition bars

00:33.301 --> 00:34.768
so we can focus
on what matters --

00:34.802 --> 00:36.337
science and holding hands.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.505
You touch her knee yet?

00:37.538 --> 00:38.439
Shut up!

00:38.472 --> 00:40.408
Almost.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.443
Thank you for scheduling
this dinner so late.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.745
I can't get out of the house
while Maria's awake anymore.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.080
Sure you can.
Use the door.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.283
No, she is just
so clingy,

00:49.317 --> 00:51.252
she has a tantrum
whenever I leave the room.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.386
Maria: Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy!

00:52.420 --> 00:53.887
It's okay, sweetie!

00:53.921 --> 00:55.389
Mommy's right here!

00:55.423 --> 00:57.425
She has a shy bladder,
though,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.360
so the more you scream,
the longer this'll take.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.229
Mommy, where are you?

01:02.330 --> 01:04.765
Honey, you have to start
ignoring her.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.067
Teach her that she doesn't
get attention by yelling.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.637
She only gets it through hard
work and academic achievement.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.904
That worked with your boys?

01:10.938 --> 01:12.473
You ignored them
and that fixed it?

01:12.506 --> 01:13.874
Oh,
they never needed it.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.043
They're so independent,
especially now.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.079
In fact,
it's freed me up for...

01:20.814 --> 01:23.284
Hey! Eyes on me!

01:23.317 --> 01:25.453
I am pleased to announce
that I will finally

01:25.486 --> 01:29.223
be recording an audiobook
of my under-appreciated novel,

01:29.257 --> 01:32.760
"A Case of a Knife
to the Brain."

01:32.793 --> 01:35.062
I'll be doing an R-rated version
and an X-rated version.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.630
Ooh!

01:36.664 --> 01:38.732
You should've said
all ea on you.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.334
It's an audiobook.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.606

"As Jennifer Hong got up
to the bazooka factory rafters,

02:03.457 --> 02:04.858
she saw a door.

02:04.892 --> 02:08.128
Her elegant fingers grasped
the knob, turned the knob,

02:08.162 --> 02:09.697
and pulled the knob --"

02:10.964 --> 02:12.466
Ooh! Sorry,
are you recording?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.000
Maria: Hi.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.770
Honey, why is there
a child on your leg?

02:16.804 --> 02:19.507
I gave you perfect advice.
She should be obedient by now.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.609
Actually, your advice
worked too well.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.177
Oh, yes. My curse.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.712
I ignored her,
and she calmed down,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.347
but then
I started to miss

02:26.380 --> 02:28.549
all that clinginess
and affection.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.184
Oh, yes. Your curse.

02:30.218 --> 02:33.854
I guess, but right now,
she's my precious little girl.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.823
Don't you miss when your boys
were this young?

02:35.856 --> 02:37.124
No.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.459
I put in the work,

02:38.492 --> 02:41.195
and I taught them to study hard,
feed themselves,

02:41.229 --> 02:43.831
so now I can focus
on my own life again.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.798
Speaking of which...

02:46.400 --> 02:50.504
"And as the bazooka factory
rafter door creaked open --"

02:52.873 --> 02:55.142
Wow, your door impression
is incredible.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.077
That wasn't me.
I can only do doors closing.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.712
I haven't mastered
doors opening yet.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.483
Evan.
What's wrong?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.218
Sicily broke up with me.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.387
Oh, my precious
little boy!

03:06.420 --> 03:08.556
Come here! It's okay!

03:08.589 --> 03:10.724
I told you it's hard
to ignore your children.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.526
This is totally different.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.928
This isn't a baby crying
for more milk.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.697
This is
a beautiful young man,

03:16.730 --> 03:20.067
who has been betrayed
by an evil, ugly witch.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.537
Okay.
Come on, Maria.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.605
Bye.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.512
I'm telling you, turducken
is not Thanksgiving-exclusive.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.080
We could do it
year-round.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.616
And I'm telling you -- I see
"turd" on a restaurant menu?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.217
I'm eating somewhere else.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.419
Louis: We've got
another one, boys!

03:38.452 --> 03:40.020
Looks like Burger Barrel
thinks they have

03:40.053 --> 03:41.555
the "Best Burger
in Orlando."

03:41.589 --> 03:43.424
Those suckers don't know
what they're in for.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.058
You mean when you buy
their food and talk about it?

03:45.092 --> 03:47.395
Trent, just...
Okay?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.930
Hey, boss, think I could
get in on the action this time?

03:49.963 --> 03:51.365
Oh, sorry, Chestnut,

03:51.399 --> 03:53.601
but this is more of
a Huang-boys-only thing.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.202
Alright. Yeah.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.570
I guess you would
have to adopt me.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.772
Which would be crazy, right?

03:58.806 --> 03:59.673
Right?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.043
Whoa, no bacon bits?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.945
I get it, saving space
for the beef.

04:04.978 --> 04:05.979
Smart.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.548
I could learn from you.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.784
Well, actually...

04:12.119 --> 04:14.588
Look, I wasn't sure
how to say this before,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.990
but I was watching PBS,
and there was this documentary

04:17.024 --> 04:18.292
called "Fatal Farming."

04:18.326 --> 04:19.927
Long story short...

04:19.960 --> 04:22.663
God, why is this so hard?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.732
The thing is...

04:24.765 --> 04:26.133
I'm vegan now.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.570
A vegan?

04:29.603 --> 04:30.771
No.

04:30.804 --> 04:34.842
No boss's son of mine is
gonna be a stinkin' vegan!

04:36.043 --> 04:37.511
Here I am, ready to give
my left chestnut

04:37.545 --> 04:38.679
to be a Burger Boy,

04:38.712 --> 04:40.314
and you're gonna give
a spot to this little...

04:40.348 --> 04:41.515
leaf-muncher?!

04:41.549 --> 04:42.816
It's disgusting!

04:42.850 --> 04:44.452
Whoa, you need to cool down!
Oh, I need to cool down!

04:46.053 --> 04:47.488
I'm sorry, boss.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.922
You never think
it'll be your kid.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.624
Sorry, just
playing catch-up here,

04:50.658 --> 04:51.792
but what's a vegan?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.527
It's like a vegetarian,
except you don't eat

04:53.561 --> 04:55.095
any animal products,
not just meat.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.965
So no dairy, no eggs --

04:57.998 --> 04:59.833
Wait, what about candy?
Can you still eat candy?

04:59.867 --> 05:02.470
Guys, this doesn't have
to be a whole thing.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.372
I don't need to eat burgers
to be a Burger Boy.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.773
It'll still be fun
to hang out.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.375
Emery's right.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.510
Nothing has to change.
I'm sure it'll all be fine.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.678
Yeah,
you're probably right.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.945
It'll be totally fine,

05:11.979 --> 05:13.614
like when my sister
Tiffany stopped drinking.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.450
Huh. I didn't know you had
a sister named Tiffany.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.318
We don't talk about her
because she stopped being fun.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.193
Do we have any Gatorade?

05:26.226 --> 05:28.562
My new boyfriend's
a lot of fun.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.364
No, and keep it down.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.333
Evan's had a tough day,
and he's trying to sleep.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.703
You're giving Evan
too much attention.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.539
What about the advice
you gave blondie?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.007
Jenny,
you eavesdrop too much.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.575
One day, it's gonna come back
and bite you.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.176
The last thing that tried
to bite me

05:43.210 --> 05:45.012
is waiting
in the garage.

05:45.045 --> 05:48.015
Maria is a toddler,
Evan is a teenager.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.550
It's different.
Give him a day.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.218
Tomorrow he'll be
back to normal.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.653
I got to get back.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.089
And don't come in no matter
how much I yell "help."

05:58.392 --> 05:59.727
Mommy,
I had a bad dream.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.395
Oh, it was just
your grandmother.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.563
Shh.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.502
Uh...sorry.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.703
Are you sure
this is okay?

06:09.737 --> 06:10.738
Not too weird?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.372
Not at all.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.775
I'm loaded on vitamin B12
with all these fresh vegetables.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.043
I'm in a great mood.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.611
Is it just me,

06:17.645 --> 06:19.780
or is tofu at a burger joint
a real bummer?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.982
It's like a cat
at a dog show. Disrespectful.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.787
Two Double-Barrel Burgers
for you.

06:26.820 --> 06:31.425
And a seltzer for the boy
who brought in outside food.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.093
Thanks.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.061
Well...

06:37.064 --> 06:38.198
Oh.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.040
We finally found
the one burger

06:47.074 --> 06:48.576
the Hamburglar
wouldn't steal.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.243
You can tell
these were frozen.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.479
Burrrr-ger.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.546
Boom! Got 'em!

06:54.448 --> 06:55.716
Umm...

06:55.749 --> 06:57.985
Are you sure
you don't want to try it?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.654
So you can see how bad it is?
One bite won't kill you.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.089
First of all, you don't
know that. What if I choke?

07:02.122 --> 07:04.424
Second, I'm serious
about my veganism, Dad.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.459
But you two should enjoy.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.262
You know,
maybe we just call it.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.263
There's something
about this place

07:10.297 --> 07:11.965
that isn't as fun
as I thought.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.634
Oh, that reminds me.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.469
There's this vegan restaurant,
Cafe Fiona, that says

07:15.503 --> 07:17.738
they have the Best Veggie Burger
in Orlando.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.473
Whaddaya say we put 'em
in their place, huh?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.676
Oh, wow, yeah.
Cool. Can't wait.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.077
You're not gonna like
the price,

07:24.111 --> 07:26.013
but that's what it costs
to make a patty out of beans.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.080
And bun out of beans.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.016
And cheese out of beans.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.685
And the parking's
valet-only.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.490
Soothes the vocal cords...

07:36.524 --> 07:38.091
and boosts fertility?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.460
Just do one thing well.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.831
Oh, you're looking refreshed,
how are you feeling?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.533
Better.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.134
Spending time with you always
makes me feel better, Mommy.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.036
Great.
That's solved.

07:50.638 --> 07:54.074
My cords are soothed.
It's time.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.650
What's happening?
What -- What is this?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.718
Spending yesterday together
felt so good,

08:04.752 --> 08:05.953
I thought,
why not do it again?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.722
Oh.
Another day of that.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.358
Hm.
Okay, I guess you can
observe my process.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.492
Hm.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.078
Out you go.
You're gonna miss the bus.
Are you gonna be waiting here
when I get home?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.180
I promise.
Which room?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.548
Uhp, the door's closing.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.486
Jessica, you were right --

08:39.519 --> 08:41.421
you make a perfect
door-closing sound.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.757
I can make the perfect
ass-kissing sound.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.561
Evan is more clingy
than ever.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.563
I thought I raised him
to be the perfect machine.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.332
But I didn't account
for one thing -- love.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.334
Now he's turned
on his creator.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.603
Like the "Terminator."

08:55.636 --> 08:57.671
I need a plan.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.607
How do you fix someone
who's just been dumped?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.008
I really wish
I could help,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.110
but I've actually never had
my heart broken.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.245
My nicknames in high school
were "Honey the Heartbreaker"

09:05.278 --> 09:07.881
and another I just realized
I shouldn't tell you guys.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.250
I've never had
my heart broken either.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.419
One guy tried, but he
woke up the next morning

09:12.452 --> 09:14.221
with his mattress
floating down the Potomac.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.923
Embarrassing for a senator.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.290
I always do the dumping.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.893
I've dumped 14 boyfriends
this year.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.095
Hey, babe.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.230
You wanted to talk?

09:24.297 --> 09:26.033
Time to make it 15.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.802
Let's do this
in the garage.

09:28.836 --> 09:29.803
Hmm?

09:29.837 --> 09:31.238
Okay. The garage.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.375
That's it.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.211
I just need to talk to some duds
who've been dumped.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.613
Did Jenny get a nurse?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.482
What just happened?

09:42.515 --> 09:43.651
Dud.

09:45.118 --> 09:45.986
* Send me on my way

09:46.019 --> 09:47.320
* On my way

09:47.354 --> 09:48.121
* Send me on my way

09:48.155 --> 09:48.956
* On my way

09:48.989 --> 09:50.223
* Send me on my way

09:50.257 --> 09:50.991
* On my way

09:51.024 --> 09:52.392
* Send me on my way

09:52.425 --> 09:53.160
* On my way

09:53.193 --> 09:54.261
* Send me on my way

09:54.294 --> 09:55.829
A lot of hemp
on these vegans.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.731
Cashier: Number 50!
Your food's sprouted!

09:57.765 --> 09:59.299
That's us!

09:59.332 --> 10:00.433
50?

10:00.467 --> 10:02.770
You mean 49 other people
ordered this crap?

10:02.803 --> 10:03.971
I can't believe
we're stuck here

10:04.004 --> 10:05.939
instead of trying
Leroy's Burger Town.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.074
Did you see their ad?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.909
I did. Scrambled eggs
in a burger patty?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.679
Sounds terrible,
but also maybe amazing?

10:11.712 --> 10:12.479
Who knows?

10:12.512 --> 10:14.614
Not us.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.017
But we can't eat that
around Emery. It's too weird.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.986
Look,
it'll all be fine.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.420
He's probably just going
through a phase.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.454
You know how he's been.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.423
Gentlemen, ready your wit.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.660
The "Best Veggie Burger
in Orlando" is served!

10:26.694 --> 10:28.662
Wait, it's just
veggie stuff?

10:28.696 --> 10:30.030
Not like,
a veggie/beef mix?

10:30.063 --> 10:32.833
Wait, I have
my shoe bologna!

10:32.866 --> 10:34.935
Oh, damn it.
I ate it in the car.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.009
Ugh!
This tastes like cardboard

10:42.042 --> 10:43.276
that was left out
in the rain.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.478
There's definitely
dirt in here.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.214
And it might be
on purpose.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.983
What if this isn't a phase?

10:51.719 --> 10:53.987
You can really taste
the chickpea husks.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.255
Thank you, Mother Earth,
right?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.193
Welcome, heartbroken flops.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.661
Thank you for meeting
with me here today.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.031
Yeah. Sure thing.
Always a pleasure.
Sup.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.199
You're all here because
you've been dumped before --

11:06.233 --> 11:07.735
some, I'm assuming,
more than others.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.036
Guilty!

11:09.069 --> 11:11.038
But you've all managed
to bounce back

11:11.071 --> 11:14.474
and become mostly
functioning adults.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.575
How?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.844
Marvin?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.245
Oh, well,
I just rebounded

11:18.278 --> 11:20.147
the way
my father taught me --

11:20.180 --> 11:21.648
move south
and date younger.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.984
My high-school sweetheart
was a 50-year-old in Maine.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.954
"Marvin -- useless."

11:27.721 --> 11:29.356
Never thought these words
would come out of my mouth,

11:29.389 --> 11:31.825
but, Matthew Chestnut,
please speak.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.326
Well, uh,
let me tell ya --

11:33.360 --> 11:36.930
me and Madam Heartbreak
go way, way back.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.198
I hate you.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.333
But every time she does
pay me a visit,

11:40.367 --> 11:41.869
I just crack open
a bottle of whiskey,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.403
put on an old Western,

11:43.436 --> 11:47.841
and weep until my eyes
are as dry as the desert sands.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.010
Spoken like a man who's
never been to the desert.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.445
Y'know, it's truly amazing
how many tears

11:52.479 --> 11:53.881
one man can produce
in a single month.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.884
"Never talk
to Chestnut again."

11:56.917 --> 11:59.452
Alright, tank-top.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.553
Prove your worth.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.389
Hmm? What?

12:02.422 --> 12:03.690
I-I'm sorry.
Marvin: Go, man.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.258
This hangover
is killing me.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.459
I-I had a wild night out

12:06.493 --> 12:08.395
with the boys last night,
y'know?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.798
Jackson bought some shots,
Trey invited some babes,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.400
Cody did some
sick backflips.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.202
By the end of the night
I had forgotten

12:15.235 --> 12:17.871
about your mother-in-law --
and my home address.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.240
You know, unlike your choice
in women,

12:20.273 --> 12:22.009
that idea
is not half-bad.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.245
A party could get Evan
off my back

12:25.278 --> 12:26.880
and might help him
get over his break-up.

12:26.914 --> 12:27.781
Hmm.
Hmm.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.149
Hmm.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.217
Okay,
I just have to ask.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.451
I grew up in Bangor.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.586
Was she a thin woman
with glasses?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.055
No.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.225
She was a tub of clam chowder
with perfect vision.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.759
Whew!

12:41.528 --> 12:42.595
"She sipped her coffee."

12:43.864 --> 12:45.465
"The clock ticked.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.400
Seconds turned into minutes.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.802
Minutes turned into hours.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.603
Hours turned into days.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.072
Days turned into weeks.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.440
She flagged down the waitress.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.441
'More coffee?'

12:54.474 --> 12:55.976
One cup turned into two.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.144
Two cups turned into three --"

12:57.177 --> 12:58.578
Evan: Mommy!

12:58.611 --> 13:01.014
I forgot how bad
the school cafeteria food is.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.615
Can you please make me
a healthy snack?

13:02.649 --> 13:03.683
Please, Mommy?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.418
Maybe in a bit,
but first

13:05.452 --> 13:08.621
I have a different,
original idea of my own.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.457
Call your friends and tell them
you're having a sleepover!

13:10.490 --> 13:12.192
But you said sleepovers
are just a scam

13:12.225 --> 13:13.326
to get free babysitting.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.495
They are,
but I'll make an exception.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.130
You're the best, Mommy!

13:17.164 --> 13:18.498
I'll go call people
right now.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.700
And you'll do this...
without me?

13:20.733 --> 13:22.702
Sure!

13:24.371 --> 13:27.875
"Three cups turned into four.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.943
Four cups turned into five.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.312
She asked for the bathroom code.

13:32.345 --> 13:37.117
It was 9-7-2-5-3-1-8-0 --"

13:37.150 --> 13:38.018
Mom?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.287
Damn it, Emery!

13:40.320 --> 13:42.489
She was just about to meet
Gorbachev in the bathroom!

13:42.522 --> 13:44.958
Have you seen Eddie and Dad?
I can't find them anywhere.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.727
Well, they said
something about going
to Leroy's Burger Town.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.063
Wait, they went to
Leroy's Burger Town without me?

13:50.097 --> 13:52.465
Are you at Leroy's Burger Town
right now?

13:52.499 --> 13:53.533
No.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.567
Well...

13:58.571 --> 14:00.040
They call this a burger?!

14:00.073 --> 14:02.742
More like a...a booger.

14:02.775 --> 14:03.810
Sandwich.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.478
Cooked not good.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.480
Don't force it.
There's a lot to figure out.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.916
You're eating,
you're talking.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.383
Just slow down.
You'll find it.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.886
I know, I know.
I'm just so eager to please.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.888
We're pleased, man.
Pleased you're here.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.757
You're sneaking off
without me?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.026
And you invited Trent?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.660
What happened to
Huang boys only?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.095
Well, what happened
to eating meat?

14:22.129 --> 14:23.330
It hurts the animals!

14:23.363 --> 14:25.165
Of course it does!
It's meat!

14:25.198 --> 14:27.167
Hey, I'm not the one that owes
an explanation here.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.569
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Not you, Trent!

14:29.602 --> 14:31.438
I don't know you that well,
but you seem very nice!

14:32.539 --> 14:34.107
Well, since you two clearly
didn't want me here,

14:34.141 --> 14:35.475
I guess I'll just go.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.712
That's right, everyone!

14:39.746 --> 14:41.181
Get your stares in now!

14:41.214 --> 14:43.750
We're all dealing
with something!

14:46.486 --> 14:49.589
Alright, Zack --
Truth or Math?

14:49.622 --> 14:50.924
Truth.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.860
Alright, boys,
I'm gonna leave now.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.195
You sure you're all okay?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.429
Evan, you're good?

14:56.463 --> 14:57.931
Yes, Mommy.
Now please go.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.699
Zack picked "truth."

14:59.732 --> 15:02.235
We're in uncharted territory,
and it's gonna get weird.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.073
Well, then?
C'mon.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.941
Who would you
rather kiss --

15:07.975 --> 15:09.442
my mom or Jeff's mom?

15:09.476 --> 15:10.978
Ooh.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.213
Do you have a 5?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.481
Go fish.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.483
We've played
the whole deck.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.717
I know you have a 5.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.152
Go fish.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.222
I hate to admit it,
but your ex

15:22.255 --> 15:23.556
had some good advice

15:23.590 --> 15:27.060
about distracting Evan
with his "wild night."

15:27.094 --> 15:30.097
I don't mean to be rude,
but you weren't paying that guy?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.831
Not with money.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.467
Oh, it's so nice

15:34.501 --> 15:37.737
to finally be able to have
some time to myself!

15:37.770 --> 15:39.739
Evan was driving me nuts,

15:39.772 --> 15:43.610
always following me around
with the "Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!"

15:43.643 --> 15:46.113
The clinginess
was just too much.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.815
Just getting some juice.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.017
Hopefully
it's not too much.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.526
Oops, there I go again.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.793
Too much.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.295
She gets it, Evan!

16:02.329 --> 16:04.431
You're just
wasting juice!

16:10.170 --> 16:12.339
Well, I guess
I'll leave you be,

16:12.372 --> 16:14.507
now that you "finally
have time for yourself."

16:14.541 --> 16:15.808
Look, Evan, I don't know

16:15.842 --> 16:17.610
what you think you heard,
but I wasn't --

16:17.644 --> 16:19.046
Let's check the tapes.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.314
You were recording?

16:21.348 --> 16:24.484
Jessica:
Evan was driving me nuts,
always following me around

16:24.517 --> 16:26.519
with the "Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!"

16:27.387 --> 16:29.289
Nobody learned
from Watergate.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.058
Look, Evan, I wasn't --

16:31.091 --> 16:32.625
Don't worry, Mommy.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.294
What's a few more cracks
in this broken heart of mine?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.135
It'll be okay, Jessica.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.471
I mean, parents are allowed to
mess up once in a while.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.739
Marvin gave Maria coffee
yesterday.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.808
I've never messed up
like this before.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.577
He'll come back.
They all do.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.546
Louis still comes to me
for motherly support.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.914
Really?

16:54.947 --> 16:56.983
Interesting.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.985
Honey: It's not that Marvin
isn't satisfying in bed.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.254
It's just, I don't have
the stamina to keep up.
Okay, Jenny, that's enough.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.390
Hey, Emery.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.591
Look, about earlier --

17:04.624 --> 17:05.925
Yeah,
about earlier indeed!

17:05.958 --> 17:07.760
I can't believe you picked
undercooked meat blood

17:07.794 --> 17:09.062
over your own
flesh and blood.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.563
Well, I got news
for you, kid.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.233
I run a steakhouse!
That's how we survive!

17:13.266 --> 17:14.767
Meat paid for
the clothes on your back,

17:14.801 --> 17:15.902
meat paid for your bed,

17:15.935 --> 17:17.204
meat paid for
your commemorative coins!

17:17.237 --> 17:19.038
Your life
was built on meat!

17:19.072 --> 17:20.673
Yeah, what's the deal,
Emery?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.075
You too good
for meat now or what?

17:22.109 --> 17:23.376
If you're too good
for meat,

17:23.410 --> 17:25.245
I guess you're too good
for...this alarm clock!

17:25.278 --> 17:27.013
And this journal!

17:27.046 --> 17:29.048
And this...bowl of...

17:29.082 --> 17:30.517
loose batteries.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.851
You know what, Dad?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.686
I never judged you for eating
and selling meat.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.854
I respected you.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.890
And all I wanted was
some respect in return.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.629
Hey, is this sleepover
still happening?

17:42.662 --> 17:45.565
Yeah, because if not, uh,
that would actually be a relief.

17:45.598 --> 17:49.436
I need my home bathroom to...
do what I need to do.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.073
I know I'm on your bed,
but it's not because I'm clingy.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.475
There was just
nowhere else to go.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.211
Evan, I felt awful
for hurting you.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.379
I didn't know what to do,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.448
so I called my mom
to talk about it.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.783
Did she go on a rant about
how annoying you are?

18:03.816 --> 18:06.119
Actually, she sent me
straight to voicemail.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.121
But the fact that I
wanted to call her

18:08.155 --> 18:09.722
made me
realize something --

18:09.756 --> 18:13.626
sometimes a kid
just needs their mom.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.129
Unless your mom's a hamster.
They eat their babies.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.731
So you figured out
Cool Ranch Jr. didn't
move to Seattle?

18:18.765 --> 18:19.632
Yeah.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.800
Did Eddie?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.169
No.
And I won't tell him.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.173
You're always so perfect,
I sometimes forget

18:26.206 --> 18:28.408
it doesn't mean
you won't struggle.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.311
I was glad I could be here
to help you --

18:31.344 --> 18:32.845
because I know
I won't always be.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.247
Oh, no. Are you dying?

18:34.281 --> 18:35.582
What about the prophecy?

18:35.615 --> 18:36.783
What? No.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.151
I'm talking about
when you go off to college.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.019
The psychic's prediction
is still true.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.688
Mommy will outlive you all.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.156
Oh, thank God.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.092
Please sing at my funeral.
You have a lovely voice.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.027
It was wrong of me
to get annoyed at you

18:48.060 --> 18:50.129
just for needing
my support.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.365
Getting over heartbreak
takes time.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.800
Or so I've heard.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.269
I guess I might have been
overdoing it a bit.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.137
And also, I started
to hear myself,

18:58.171 --> 19:00.006
and all that "Mommy"
is a bit much.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.941
From now on,
you can be "Mother."

19:01.974 --> 19:04.611
Mm, just call me "Mom."

19:04.644 --> 19:07.146
It's the easiest thing to scream
when you're being kidnapped.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.385
I got the weird invitation
you slid under my door.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.354
Your handwriting
is really bad, Eddie.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.888
Look, you're still upset.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.390
We've all been saying things
we don't mean --

19:17.424 --> 19:18.625
No, it's bad.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.159
You should know which way
an "E" faces by now.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.361
We have computers.
Who cares?!

19:21.394 --> 19:23.796
Look, we're sorry.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.031
We messed up big time.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.066
You did.
You did do that.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.135
And we're sorry we bounced you
out of the Burger Boys.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.570
We really did like
hanging out.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.971
I mean,
look at this trio.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.073
How often are
the three of us a thing?

19:34.106 --> 19:36.576
It was never supposed
to be about burgers.
It was about bonding.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.345
It was hard for me not to see
you going vegan

19:38.378 --> 19:39.579
as a judgment on me.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.548
You don't claim to be
the best in town,

19:41.581 --> 19:42.915
so I'd never judge you.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.417
Thanks.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.319
Now, we did invite you to
Cattleman's for a reason.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.920
We put our heads together
and made you

19:47.954 --> 19:49.389
a good veggie burger --

19:49.422 --> 19:50.990
not like that crap
from the restaurant.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.559
Thanks, guys.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.202
So?
What do you think?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.573
Wow, it's, uh...

20:06.606 --> 20:08.040
in my mouth.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.913
"As he knelt over his lover's
pale, lifeless body

20:13.946 --> 20:17.784
he took her pale, lifeless hands
in his darker, alive hands.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.419
He turned his neck upward

20:19.452 --> 20:21.220
and screamed
to the heavens..."

20:21.254 --> 20:23.623
Whyyyy?!
How could this have happened?!

20:23.656 --> 20:24.924
My heart
has been broken!!

20:24.957 --> 20:26.058
Sicily!!

20:26.092 --> 20:27.694
Whew!

20:27.727 --> 20:30.263
Sorry, this is way more
therapeutic than I thought.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.231
I'm glad it's helping,
but just so you know,

20:32.265 --> 20:34.301
you're not making
any royalties from this.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.234
I know, Mom.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.307
"He turned his neck upward,
then screamed to the heavens..."

20:50.417 --> 20:51.618
Thank you for such
a lovely date, Jenny.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.152
What the hell?

20:53.185 --> 20:55.221
You really do know
your "Matlock" trivia.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.290
Color me impressed.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.992
And you really know how
to talk over the best parts.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.502
Heard there was an opening
in the Burger Boys

21:09.536 --> 21:12.004
and you skipped over me for
your little golden boy Trent.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.407
So now I'm dating
your mother.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.608
It's your move, boss.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.013
You employ
some odd people, Dad.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.282
I like the ones
with low self-esteem.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.451
They do anything.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.452
Hm.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.120
Think that's a good idea.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.489
Hmm.
