00:05.089 --> 00:08.252
I had to take it. Have you really thought
about what he's gonna do?

00:08.426 --> 00:11.384
-Everyone is gonna die. Everyone.
-You did the right thing.

00:11.554 --> 00:14.546
I'm gonna go to the police. I have to.
I'm gonna give it to them.

00:14.724 --> 00:18.433
-If I don't, if he goes through with it--
-If he ﬁnds you, he might hurt you.

00:18.603 --> 00:21.845
I'll come with you.
Just tell me where you are.

00:29.572 --> 00:32.939
-Just promise me you'll come alone.
-I promise.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.795
I'm sorry.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.043
Where is it?

00:55.640 --> 00:57.756
-You get away from me.
-You can't stop us now.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.926
-Everything is in place. It's too late.
-You get away from me.

01:01.103 --> 01:04.436
| always thought you were different.
But you're just like the rest.

01:04.607 --> 01:06.347
-You're selfish. Give it to me.
-No.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.238
-Hey!
-Oh, no!

01:17.870 --> 01:20.907
-All right.
-Just now.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.366
Help! Somebody call an ambulance!

01:24.543 --> 01:28.161
-Here.
-That's crazy, man. I'm just like, "whoa."

01:28.339 --> 01:31.001
She just stepped out.
She jumped in front of that car.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.335
She's not breathing.

01:46.983 --> 01:49.269
I told you to get rid of him.

01:49.694 --> 01:51.605
Lizzy, I'm not getting rid of him.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.564
-Your safety is of great concern to me.
-Yeah, I can handle myself.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.118
ljust—- I don't want him watching me.

01:59.412 --> 02:00.868
What is all this?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.911
There was an incident this morning
in Dupont Circle.

02:06.085 --> 02:10.670
A woman was struck by a taxi.
Carrie Ann Beck.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.250
Maddox Beck's wife?

02:12.425 --> 02:14.541
Yes. The leaders of The Front.

02:14.719 --> 02:18.257
Well, how is that possible? They died
trying to bomb BP's London office...

02:18.431 --> 02:21.889
-...in response to the gulf oil spill.
-So the world believes.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.641
In truth,
they took their work underground.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.178
Personally,
I once admired Carrie Anne.

02:27.356 --> 02:31.440
However, since going underground,
they've become too radical for my blood.

02:31.610 --> 02:36.730
Advocates for a level of destruction
that | find chilling.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.614
-So who killed her?
-I believe her husband is responsible.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.902
Weren't they partners?
Didn't they found The Front together?

02:43.080 --> 02:46.322
Yes, but their partnership
was a tenuous one.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.207
She was always
the more moderate voice...

02:49.378 --> 02:52.962
...only interested in operations
that related directly to the environment.

02:53.132 --> 02:57.546
Beck, on the other hand,
views himself as a chosen one...

02:57.720 --> 03:01.178
...a messianic ﬁgure
who sees humanity as a virus...

03:01.349 --> 03:04.807
...that needs to be eradicated
in order to save the planet.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.263
I fear he got rid of his wife...

03:07.438 --> 03:12.102
...because she was trying to stop him
from implementing a plan to do just that.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.860
These are the last known photographs
of Maddox Beck and his wife.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.396
-They're the founders of The Front.
-2012:

03:18.574 --> 03:20.690
Firebomb strikes a biotech park
in Boston...

03:20.868 --> 03:25.032
...conducting genomics research,
causing $64 million in damage.

03:25.206 --> 03:29.370
2013: Four staff members were killed
and 16 hospitalized.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.080
Ricin was mailed
to the Fairbanks BLM office.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.996
-Manages Transatlantic Pipeline.
-Just got off with the ME.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.085
He'll have a tox workup on Beck's wife.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.251
We can't assume Beck killed her
just because Reddington says so.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.215
Get to the morgue.
I want a cause of death.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.426
Not at the morgue.
She's at City Memorial.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.137
-Labor and delivery.
-She was pregnant?

03:47.311 --> 03:49.097
Yeah, 30 weeks.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.557
From what they can tell,
the baby's fine.

03:52.483 --> 03:55.020
-And the mother?
-The doctors declared her brain dead.

03:55.194 --> 03:59.028
They put her on life support
until they can safely deliver the child.

03:59.198 --> 04:02.031
Most of the injuries were sustained
during the accident...

04:02.201 --> 04:04.817
...but she suffered some injuries
beforehand as well.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.533
Lacerations to the head and the hands
and defensive bruises on the forearms.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.665
-Think he beat her?
-I think she was in one hell of a fight.

04:11.836 --> 04:14.498
You say in your notes
she had clay under her fingernails?

04:14.672 --> 04:16.879
Clay? From where?
That's odd, isn't it?

04:17.049 --> 04:21.258
The really odd part
is that the clay is 700 years old.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.467
The soil found under the nails
of Carrie Ann Beck...

04:25.641 --> 04:27.882
...dates back to the 14th century.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.722
-lt's called raw sienna.
-Okay, so, what's it doing there?

04:30.896 --> 04:33.012
Raw sienna was used by painters
at the time...

04:33.190 --> 04:35.602
...painters who belonged
to the Sienese school.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.397
Prado in Madrid has an exhibit
going on right now...

04:38.571 --> 04:40.778
...featuring paintings
from the Sienese school.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.030
Last week,
one of those paintings was stolen.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.236
That's what she and Beck
were fighting over.

04:45.411 --> 04:48.494
Maybe trying to sell it
on the black market, fund their operation.

04:48.664 --> 04:52.031
There were 22 paintings.
One that was stolen had been on loan...

04:52.209 --> 04:56.327
...from the Santa Caterina church in Pisa,
and it was, by far, the least valuable.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.666
Then why did they steal it?

05:51.227 --> 05:52.592
Come on!

05:56.982 --> 05:58.563
Number 76.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.935
Number 76!

06:06.659 --> 06:07.944
I've been busting my ass!

06:08.118 --> 06:10.655
And now you fire me because I'm not,
what, fast enough?

06:10.829 --> 06:12.205
I'll need all your research.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.329
-No!
-And any leads as to her whereabouts.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.786
You want me to find the girl?
I'll find the girl.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.417
But these things take time!

06:19.088 --> 06:20.373
You don't have any leads.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.622
You know what? I don't have time!

06:23.801 --> 06:27.168
And yet you've had me waiting out there
for over 45 minutes.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.302
Do you know the vending machine
is broken?

06:29.473 --> 06:32.681
It's as if you enjoy
making people miserable.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.977
| work at the DMV!

06:34.144 --> 06:37.136
If you can't do this,
I need to find someone who can.

06:37.314 --> 06:40.181
Everything rests on finding the girl.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.190
I understand, and I'm trying my best.

06:42.361 --> 06:46.149
But you didn't give me much to go on,
and I've had some....

06:48.659 --> 06:50.365
-ls something wrong?
-You know what?

06:51.787 --> 06:54.199
Just forget it.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.537
Talk to me.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.497
It's Mom.

07:04.883 --> 07:05.963
Oh, Glen.

07:06.135 --> 07:11.346
Three months ago,
she was in the shower, noticed this lump.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.716
-How bad?
-Got into her bones.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.724
They bombarded her with chemo.

07:16.895 --> 07:20.888
We've tried everything.
The pills and the diets, biofeedback...

07:21.066 --> 07:22.351
...music therapy...

07:23.068 --> 07:24.899
...the flaxseed diet.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.322
-Flaxseed?
-Part of the Budwig protocol.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.525
-I don't have time for this.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.941
Has Mom's illness cramped
your busy schedule?

07:32.119 --> 07:35.862
Every time you can't deliver, you do this.
These cockamamie stories!

07:36.040 --> 07:37.325
My mother is dying!

07:37.499 --> 07:40.161
Yes, and your brother-in-law
had Legionnaires' disease...

07:40.336 --> 07:43.920
...and your house was flooded,
and I'm still no closer to finding the girl.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.795
Get out!

07:49.595 --> 07:52.337
You're the most gifted tracker I know,
Glen...

07:52.514 --> 07:54.891
...but your mouth runs
like a scalded dog.

07:58.228 --> 08:02.312
I don't know why you're mad at me.
You're the one who came up short.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.687
-What kind of codes?
-Written on the back of the painting?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.526
Not on the back. Under the paint.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.237
The museum sent us everything
on the stolen painting.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.699
When it was acquired, they ran tests
to determine its authenticity.

08:17.873 --> 08:21.661
Yeah, they used thermal imaging to do
microscopic and spectroscopic analysis...

08:21.835 --> 08:24.247
...and found this.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.798
-What's it mean?
-Museum doesn't know.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.425
Call the National Gallery.
Get Lillian Sharp in here.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.588
If anyone can make heads or tails of this,
she can.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.472
Hey.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.850
Keen. Where is she?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.931
She had an appointment.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.988
-When I agreed to do this--
-lt's taking longer than I thought.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.073
-He out there?
-Yeah. I'm going out back.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.658
This is for last week.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.915
Do it one more week,
and I'll pay you double.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.876
I'll be back in one hour.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.759
-lt's a map.
-A map to what?

09:22.938 --> 09:26.226
A bedtime story.
It's a legend about the Apophis Strain...

09:26.400 --> 09:28.937
...an ancient plague
weaponized in the 14th century...

09:29.111 --> 09:31.727
...by Byzantines and Ottomans,
mistakenly released...

09:31.905 --> 09:34.612
...and believed to be the real origin
of the black death.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.944
You're talking
about the bubonic plague.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.485
No. Pneumonic plague.
Airborne and far more fatal.

09:39.955 --> 09:43.072
Scientists believe that plague
killed 200 million people...

09:43.250 --> 09:45.832
...one of the largest pandemics
in history.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.578
To prevent Armageddon, the sworn
enemies agreed to task four priests...

09:49.757 --> 09:51.713
...to take the strain
to the end of the world.

09:51.884 --> 09:55.001
And this map indicates
in which end of the world it's hidden.

09:55.179 --> 09:58.592
Agent Cooper,
you're not taking this seriously, are you?

09:58.766 --> 10:01.678
Maddox Beck is.
He killed his wife to get this map.

10:01.852 --> 10:06.061
These symbols,
trust me, this map is worthless.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.686
Thursday. Same time?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.445
Keen.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.828
Lizzy, [need to see you.
There's been a development.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.626
This map is priceless.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.831
You need to move on this.
If the Apophis strain is out there....

10:30.005 --> 10:33.247
-Well, you didn't tell this to the FBI?
-Lillian is paid to embargo...

10:33.425 --> 10:37.134
...certain key details
from your colleagues...

10:37.304 --> 10:39.670
...if she believes
they may be of interest to me.

10:40.516 --> 10:43.633
-Sure she can be trusted?
-I could say the same thing about you.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.928
Ladies, please.
I'm surprised the two of you haven't met...

10:47.105 --> 10:50.393
...at a conference or company retreat.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.683
Does the FBI do a Christmas party?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.361
One of the priests sent
to guard the strain got sick.

10:56.532 --> 10:59.740
To protect it, the dying man swallowed it,
taking it to his grave.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.822
We know this because the others
survived and created the map.

11:03.247 --> 11:06.364
-The markings? What do they mean?
-They're archetypal alignments.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.750
When you connect them,
they create lay lines...

11:09.920 --> 11:13.037
...Iinking a network
of historically significant sites.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.503
You said the priests were sent
to the end of the world. Where?

11:16.677 --> 11:19.419
Well, I said it was the end of the world.
Not anymore.

11:19.596 --> 11:24.215
If I'm reading this correctly,
the strain is buried here, in America.

11:24.393 --> 11:28.102
Red's source says the map points
to burial ridge in Staten Island.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.979
The largest Native American
burial ground in New York.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.561
We've contacted local authorities.
We're on our way.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.568
Don't know how to break this to you,
but Beck beat you there.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.696
-What?
-New York field office got called in...

11:39.867 --> 11:40.947
...on a grave robbery.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.531
According to park police, our guy, Beck,
he knew exactly where to look.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.570
The bones contain the DNA
of the plague.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.535
-He can replicate it.
-That's why he took the bones.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.043
No, he wanted to take them,
but according to park police...

11:53.213 --> 11:55.044
...whoever was buried there
was moved.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.751
Hundreds of years ago.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.507
I'm sending you an image
of what was left in its place.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.835
-Got it.
-We think it's a marker...

12:02.014 --> 12:04.676
...some sort of addendum to the map.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.306
It's Cyrillic.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.138
It's ancient Cyrillic.
Looks like some kind of equation.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.020
P equals 100.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.023
O that sort of looks like a ribbon
equals 9.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.854
Those dash symbols in between...

12:17.029 --> 12:20.396
...denotes that the number to the right
should be multiplied by 1000.

12:20.574 --> 12:25.034
It totals 109,120.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.580
Probably a measurement.
Is there a standard form?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.951
Cubits.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.995
One cubit is half a yard.

12:32.169 --> 12:37.254
A hundred and nine thousand, a hundred
and twenty cubits is 54,560 yards.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.585
What? I was good at math.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.173
There's another engraving here.
Looks like, what, a moon?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.713
Or a sun, which rises in the east.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.847
The strain's final resting place.

12:48.018 --> 12:51.852
Fifty-four thousand five hundred
and sixty yards or exactly 31 miles.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.684
Hello, Aram. Agent Navabi.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.729
You certainly look radiant.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.269
Mr. Reddington.

13:01.949 --> 13:05.783
Hey, if you're looking for Agent Keen--

13:05.953 --> 13:08.319
I'm not. I'm looking for you.

13:08.497 --> 13:13.491
Aram, are you there? What is it?
What's 31 miles east of Burial Ridge?

13:17.339 --> 13:22.925
This is the oldest church in the city.
Graves in the church, they're sacrosanct.

13:24.179 --> 13:27.387
-Is there another way in here?
-The southeast stainNell, behind the--

13:27.557 --> 13:29.013
Show me.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.009
You want me to find a girl.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.643
You can't tell me her name...

13:33.814 --> 13:37.432
...and none of the other people
who work for you were able to find her.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.228
Yes.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.643
That's not much to go on.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.857
-It's not.
-Out of curiosity...

13:43.031 --> 13:47.650
...the other people who couldn't find her,
this girl...

13:50.205 --> 13:51.911
...what did you do to them?

13:56.336 --> 14:00.500
Aram, this woman is critical in my war
with Berlin.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.864
FBI! Don't move!

14:40.297 --> 14:44.415
You know what I have in here.
You wouldn't be here if you didn't.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.634
-Put it down.
-It's incredible, isn't it?

14:48.013 --> 14:50.971
Finding America a century
before Columbus...

14:51.141 --> 14:54.383
...surviving, protecting the secret.

14:54.561 --> 14:58.474
His life had one purpose, the plague.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.680
You're not walking out of here.

15:00.859 --> 15:05.523
Do you know how contagious this is?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.314
Shoot me, I drop it...

15:08.700 --> 15:10.565
...and then we're both infected.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.071
I said put it down.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.032
Either you let me go...

15:15.624 --> 15:17.615
...or we both die.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.871
The choice is yours.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.130
You're just like everybody else.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.464
You're gonna save your life
at the expense of millions of others.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.337
Is that why you killed your wife?

15:32.516 --> 15:34.848
Carrie Ann killed herself.

15:35.894 --> 15:39.637
She wasn't able to go through with it, but
somebody needs to have the courage...

15:39.815 --> 15:41.897
...to do what's necessary.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.355
Radio Foster.

15:49.533 --> 15:50.739
Tell him we're on our way.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.824
Ressler!

15:59.042 --> 16:01.124
They have it. It's gone.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.250
The plague, it's gone.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.342
Call state and local police.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.380
Tell them we want lookouts
and checkpoints at every highway...

16:14.558 --> 16:16.799
...Ieading out of the city.
Find Maddox Beck!

16:18.019 --> 16:20.681
-You had him.
-He was in possession of the strain.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.393
-Did you hesitate or not?
-He threatened to release it.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.933
Now a madman is out there
to start a pandemic.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.023
If it's the pneumonic plague,
there are antibiotics, protocols.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.314
For the strain that exists today,
not the one that's 700 years old.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.359
We have to assume there's no cure
for whatever Beck got.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.947
I said that's enough.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.657
This is unbelievable.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.616
Alert the CDC. Tell them
that a potential Category 5 threat...

16:42.794 --> 16:46.833
...has just been identified with no cure
and a high probability of exposure.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.925
Agent Keen.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.630
Whatever decision you made,
I'm sure it was the right one.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.924
I've seen you under pressure,
in the moment.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.342
-Thank you.
-I mean it.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.011
The way you handle.
Take Mr. Reddington, for example.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.226
He asked me to do one thing
and Ifreeze up, but you--

17:05.400 --> 17:10.360
-What? What are you talking about?
-Oh, wait. No, just-- You're solid.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.191
-Reddington asked--
-Bad example.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.946
What did Reddington ask you to do?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.694
Two hundred.

17:19.873 --> 17:25.664
That is the exact number of species
that grows extinct every year.

17:25.837 --> 17:31.207
That is 10,000 times
the natural rate of extinction...

17:31.384 --> 17:34.501
...and one species is responsible.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.215
Ours.

17:38.725 --> 17:43.719
The reason that we are making
the ultimate sacrifice...

17:45.357 --> 17:48.599
...is because Earth is literally dying.

17:49.236 --> 17:54.151
Everybody knows it,
and no one will do anything about it.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.409
To preserve life on earth...

17:59.579 --> 18:04.494
...we need to become extinct.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.580
Sharon.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.204
It's time.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.852
Your wife made it clear, your daughter
has no interest in seeing you.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.102
Oh, dear.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.311
The FBI is not in the business
of handling your personal affairs.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.022
The FBI is in the business
of my business.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.312
Why else would I be in business
with the FBI?

18:35.490 --> 18:37.651
If she is in danger, we will protect her...

18:37.826 --> 18:40.738
-...either from Berlin or you.
-Who told you she's my daughter?

18:40.912 --> 18:43.574
You've no right
to have anything to do with that girl...

18:43.748 --> 18:45.579
...not since the night
you abandoned her.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.498
I'm touched.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.873
You just upended
your ex—wife's entire life.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.504
I'm not gonna let you do
the same thing to her.

18:54.592 --> 18:58.005
As a rule, I considerjealousy
to be a base emotion.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.431
But in this case, it's quite endearing.

19:00.598 --> 19:01.804
God.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.806
I am notjealous.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.262
I assure you, Lizzy...

19:05.437 --> 19:09.601
...my quest to find this young woman will
in no way compromise our relationship.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.231
-Our relationship?
-Where are we on the case?

19:12.402 --> 19:15.360
-No, no, no. We're not doing that.
-I understand you lost Beck.

19:15.530 --> 19:18.237
It must be disheartening.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.948
Let me be perfectly clear.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.452
Aram is not going to help you
find your daughter.

19:24.622 --> 19:29.412
And the guy you have following me,
either you get rid of him or I will.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.785
It's about Agent Keen.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.666
-Sir.
-She seems unusually agitated.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.294
I'm not sure why, but I believe
she's hiding something from me.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.837
-Hiding what?
-l’m not sure.

20:25.183 --> 20:28.016
But I think she's worried
you may expose her.

20:29.646 --> 20:33.889
She's made it clear she wants you gone.
I told her that’s not an option.

20:34.317 --> 20:38.651
I think she may try
to manipulate the situation.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.403
I’ve got eyes on her as we speak.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.990
She's not going anywhere.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.786
It's all well. I'll be handling.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.459
Don't.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.032
You think it's a good idea
you being here at this time?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.701
-I need to go inside.
-Girl, you're pushing it.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.832
Can I go inside?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.987
-Can you feel it?
-Yes.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.905
I can feel it inside me.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.537
I can feel it growing.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.747
Amen.

22:31.059 --> 22:35.428
Reports indicate hundreds have been
infected as a result of the outbreak.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.971
The Capitol and Supreme Court
have been evacuated.

22:38.483 --> 22:42.021
Metro police have quarantined
a 15-block area...

22:42.362 --> 22:45.604
. . . reaching from Constitution
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.524
Patient Zero has been ID'd
as Sharon McManus.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.570
...we are dealing with a modified strain
of pneumonic plague.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.613
-Modified how?
-We have no idea.

22:55.792 --> 22:59.205
-Working at an accelerated rate.
-People in quarantine, none look sick.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.871
From what the CDC can tell,
the contagion works in three phases.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.835
The first of which is incubation.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.466
Right now,
it is dormant in their immune systems.

23:07.637 --> 23:11.129
Not airborne yet, but that is only
going to last for the first few hours.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.343
-Then what?
-Turns the victim symptomatic...

23:13.518 --> 23:16.760
...then infectious. Based on what
we can tell from time of death...

23:16.938 --> 23:19.805
...and the rapid depletion
of Patient Zero's target cells...

23:19.983 --> 23:22.690
...those healthy people
will be dead in nine hours.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.567
-How many people?
-Roughly 2300 in quarantine, sir.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.571
-Talk to me about the treatment protocols.
-There are none.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.824
To understand how the disease
was altered, to find a cure...

23:31.995 --> 23:33.986
...we need a sample
of the original strain.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.949
And Beck has the only one.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.740
Full ERT report on patient zero's effects
just came in.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.830
They found this on the victim's shirt.

23:42.005 --> 23:47.090
Hair from a rodent, a rat species
specifically bred for scientific purposes.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.296
Rattus norvegicus.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.802
Only two licensed suppliers
for clinical trials.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.339
In the last month,
they've only had one shipment...

23:54.517 --> 23:57.304
...that didn't go to a university
or research facility.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.969
-Beck's shipping address.
-Property in Thurmont.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.104
Send the biohazard team at Quantico.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.980
Clear!

24:30.386 --> 24:32.468
I need you to come in.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.971
I found your girl.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.395
Number 84.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.981
The picture you gave me,
the one of the girl...

24:49.155 --> 24:51.237
...I had it aged up in the system...

24:51.407 --> 24:54.069
...and marked as an FBI inquiry
five weeks ago.

24:54.243 --> 24:57.906
-The vending machine is still not working.
-Then Dolly goes in for hair plugs.

24:58.081 --> 25:01.994
The only one in the Southwest Service
Center with access, so I'm frozen out.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.830
The woman grading the written tests
needs to shower.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.996
But this morning, Dolly comes back,
and guess what.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.584
Old Dolly got a hit.

25:11.511 --> 25:14.503
A 97 percent match on your girl.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.097
Zoe Dantonio.

25:22.271 --> 25:26.184
As I said, these things take time.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.146
What the hell is that?

25:30.988 --> 25:32.649
It's a new vending machine.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.564
Yours is broken.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.607
Consider it a bonus.

25:42.291 --> 25:46.125
Site's decontaminated. The equipment
looks like it's been used recently.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.126
My God.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.581
D.C. was just the beginning.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.090
Twenty-four cities.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.210
On every continent.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.974
They're gonna be on planes.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.928
Aram, get me the FAA.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.927
When an organism is ill...

26:05.106 --> 26:08.769
...it develops antibodies
to combat the illness.

26:08.943 --> 26:13.232
Nature creates the instruments
to eradicate deadly disease.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.364
In this case, the disease is humanity...

26:16.534 --> 26:18.570
...we're the antidotes.

26:19.078 --> 26:24.448
Climate change, water shortages,
a population approaching eight billion.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.085
We won't live to see it.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.372
And there will be no one left
to remember.

26:32.884 --> 26:39.096
But our sacrifice will usher in
the dawn of a new Earth.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.969
Sharon began our crusade...

26:43.144 --> 26:46.682
...and now the rest of us
must see it through.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.978
To a new day.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.767
To a new day.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.956
CDC quarantined a vehicle
found at Dulles.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.209
There was an inhaler mask
outside of the car.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.291
Won't have the official results for hours.
The toxins inside...

27:13.466 --> 27:15.457
...appear to match those in Beck's lab.

27:15.635 --> 27:19.173
Owner was Ron Crocker, boarded
a plane to Panama City two hours ago.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.053
Every passenger will be infected.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.431
-We have Crocker's travel profile?
-Yeah.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.476
Okay. One-way ticket, traveling alone,
no checked baggage.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.137
Ticket purchased
in the last eight hours.

27:29.315 --> 27:33.228
Can you apply the same to passengers
from Dulles to the other target cities?

27:33.402 --> 27:36.769
Every matching profile is a potential
follower infected with the plague.

27:36.948 --> 27:38.859
Okay, 31 matches.

27:39.033 --> 27:42.025
Of those,
seven are business travelers...

27:42.203 --> 27:45.411
-...who made last-minute reservations.
-Are they already in flight?

27:45.581 --> 27:49.369
All but one. Chris Perez. Leaves Dulles
for Toronto within one hour.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.409
Probably still in the incubation period.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.873
We can take him,
isolate him before he boards.

27:54.048 --> 27:57.040
You work with Aram.
Notify the FAA of those infected flights.

27:57.218 --> 28:01.086
You get to Dulles, make sure Perez
does not get on that flight.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.598
Final boarding, Flight 428,
service to Toronto...

28:12.775 --> 28:14.982
...p/ease proceed to Gate A-17.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.938
We've located four of the suspects.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.729
Two land in 45 minutes.
Moscow and Sao Paulo.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.488
Get word to the air marshals.

28:21.659 --> 28:24.401
Have teams on the tarmacs
ready to quarantine those planes.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.659
Assume the passengers
are all infected.

28:29.834 --> 28:33.372
-Quarantine won't help, only the cure.
-Which we don't have.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.718
-Follow me, please.
-We're gonna go inside. Wait for FBI.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.976
-Coming through.
-Make way. Federal agents.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.811
Stand aside, please!

29:00.823 --> 29:02.188
Federal agents.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.745
He's not at the gate.
Aram, you got eyes?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.080
Looking. Looking now.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.251
-I'm gonna double back.
-Okay.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.468
Come on.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.088
Go back. There.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.351
That's him. There he is.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.596
A blackjacket with a gray hoodie,
a green shoulder bag.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.433
Near Gate C-13.

29:57.046 --> 29:58.536
Hey!

30:33.290 --> 30:36.327
Officer down! I need a medic!

30:36.502 --> 30:37.582
You can't come in here.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.540
Samar, you're gonna bleed out.
You've got to open this door.

30:40.715 --> 30:43.957
It's out. I'm infected.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.751
If you come in here, you will be too.

30:59.692 --> 31:00.852
You'll be okay.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.063
Eighteen of the flights
have been quarantined.

31:07.241 --> 31:11.780
The suspects have been arrested.
The others, diverted with military escorts.

31:11.954 --> 31:15.321
What about the infected? Liz and Samar,
how much time do they have?

31:15.499 --> 31:18.411
-Worst case, eight hours.
-I was able to trace a credit card...

31:18.586 --> 31:21.202
...tied to tickets Beck purchased.
He created a VPN.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.872
Computer he used accessed the Internet
within a 50-mile radius of Abingdon.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.838
Get our people in Virginia
the coordinates, start a canvass.

31:28.012 --> 31:31.049
-And the radius, narrow it down.
-Yeah.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.145
Mr. Reddington,
I’m calling about Agent Keen.

31:39.315 --> 31:42.478
Circumstances have changed, Aram.
I found what I was looking for.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.189
You have? I mean, you have.
That's so-- That's fantastic.

31:46.363 --> 31:48.900
But that's actually--
That's not why I'm calling.

31:49.075 --> 31:52.488
Agent Keen, she and Agent Navabi,
they've been infected.

31:53.454 --> 31:55.786
-When?
-Just over an hour ago.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.283
Where are you on Beck?

31:57.458 --> 31:59.665
Somewhere outside Abingdon.
I don ’t know where.

31:59.835 --> 32:02.542
I've searched the public record.
Tax bills, power, phone.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.999
It's like-- It's like he lives off the grid.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.420
-Well, there you have it.
-Have what?

32:09.804 --> 32:11.294
Hello?

32:24.985 --> 32:27.271
-What?
-Nothing.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.029
What made you smile?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.569
Nipple guards.

32:36.956 --> 32:39.322
A year ago, I....

32:41.127 --> 32:43.914
Tom and I,
we were going to adopt a newborn...

32:44.922 --> 32:47.664
...and we were having a baby shower.

32:48.843 --> 32:53.712
And one of the guests, this teacher...

32:54.598 --> 32:55.974
...she brought nipple guards.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.632
Did she know you were adopting?

32:57.810 --> 33:00.017
Exactly, yes, she--

33:00.437 --> 33:03.600
It was like she was reminding me
that I wasn't pregnant.

33:03.774 --> 33:06.436
I was just so pissed.
I didn't even thank her.

33:08.863 --> 33:11.946
God, I wish I could just go back
and thank her.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.525
I had it all figured out.

33:15.703 --> 33:18.866
I was gonna have a baby...

33:21.292 --> 33:22.953
...and a husband.

33:27.548 --> 33:30.085
And then he showed up.

33:30.718 --> 33:33.710
You know everyone talks about it,
right?

33:34.930 --> 33:37.467
They don't want to bring it up
with you.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.302
Why you?

33:39.476 --> 33:41.137
Who is he to you?

33:42.479 --> 33:48.941
Reddington is the bane
of my existence.

33:49.278 --> 33:53.146
And yet, here he is,
trying to reconnect with his daughter?

33:53.532 --> 33:55.147
Trying to find her?

33:55.618 --> 33:59.486
And I find myself feeling possessive.

34:02.041 --> 34:06.284
Possessive of him,
jealous of the girl he's trying to protect.

34:07.338 --> 34:11.832
And if that's not embarrassing enough,
that's exactly how he predicted I'd feel.

34:16.847 --> 34:19.259
You think they've delivered
that baby yet?

34:19.433 --> 34:21.890
Carrie Ann Beck's?

34:22.061 --> 34:24.973
That's probably why she backed out,
right?

34:27.066 --> 34:28.852
Because of that baby.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.688
And when they find a cure...

34:32.029 --> 34:36.944
...when we walk out of here,
it'll all be because of that baby.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.911
Hey. I figured it out.

34:43.082 --> 34:46.870
Technically, Mr. Reddington figured
it out, but I think I know where Beck is.

34:47.044 --> 34:50.161
He's a radical environmentalist,
so any electricity would be solar.

34:50.339 --> 34:53.001
We have a 50-mile search area.
Could be dozens of houses.

34:53.175 --> 34:56.383
Using grid-tied power.
But people who wanna sever ties...

34:56.553 --> 34:59.340
...they would use off-grid systems,
which are very uncommon.

34:59.515 --> 35:01.346
-How uncommon?
-Could only find one...

35:01.517 --> 35:04.350
...to support a compound large enough
for Beck...

35:04.520 --> 35:06.010
...and his followers.

35:06.188 --> 35:09.396
I should mention, I'm pretty sure
Mr. Reddington has a head start.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.229
Pepper, what's...?

35:16.824 --> 35:19.941
You two out here
playing grab-ass in the woods...

35:23.706 --> 35:24.946
Who the hell are you?

35:25.124 --> 35:27.706
I'm the snake in the grass.

35:32.756 --> 35:35.543
I was a big fan of yours at one time.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.794
I remember you in that little
inflatable boat in the North Sea...

35:39.972 --> 35:42.429
...going up against that oil platform...

35:42.599 --> 35:46.137
...huge waves tossing you up
against the pilings...

35:46.312 --> 35:51.352
...fire hoses and steel oil drums
raining down from above.

35:51.525 --> 35:55.188
My God, it gives me goose bumps
just thinking about it.

35:56.655 --> 36:01.820
Then I had the good fortune of sharing
a cell in a prison outside Sochi with a--

36:01.994 --> 36:04.701
An associate of yours,
Yevgeny Bushkin.

36:04.872 --> 36:09.115
Big bear of a man,
150 kilos on an empty belly.

36:09.293 --> 36:12.706
As I remember it,
Yevgeny went on a hunger strike...

36:12.880 --> 36:18.420
...to protest some oil pipeline that
threatened a vital something or other.

36:18.594 --> 36:20.300
You probably remember better than I.

36:20.471 --> 36:26.637
But the point is the old boy
didn't eat for 74 days.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.425
Imagine that.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.393
I wouldn't have the discipline.

36:30.564 --> 36:33.021
My weakness is sausage and peppers.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.395
But Yevgeny...

36:36.987 --> 36:38.067
...he did it.

36:38.906 --> 36:42.569
Wasted away like Christ on the cross...

36:42.993 --> 36:44.949
...dying for a cause.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.865
Your cause.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.458
And I remember thinking
that the only men I've known...

36:52.628 --> 36:56.917
...that have people
who are willing to die for their cause...

36:57.091 --> 37:01.585
...are either saints or megalomaniacs.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.381
...are no saint.

37:07.184 --> 37:10.426
Which is why I'm not surprised
to find you and Pepper...

37:10.604 --> 37:13.437
...waiting out Armageddon
here in Eden.

37:13.941 --> 37:18.105
You and I both know
you're not gonna die for your cause.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.655
Put that down.

37:20.823 --> 37:21.903
You dig up a plague...

37:22.074 --> 37:24.406
...hatch a plan to spread it
around the world...

37:24.576 --> 37:27.818
...but before you do,
you synthesize a cure...

37:27.996 --> 37:30.783
...for yourself and your Eve.

37:32.292 --> 37:34.078
Ironic, isn't it?

37:34.253 --> 37:38.713
If you were half as dedicated
to your cause as Yevgeny was...

37:38.882 --> 37:41.874
...there would be no vaccine,
I wouldn't be here...

37:42.052 --> 37:44.839
...and you and Pepper
would be free to romp like bunnies...

37:45.013 --> 37:47.299
...until the convulsing
and hemorrhaging started.

37:47.474 --> 37:51.433
You're wrong. My actions are about
our crimes against the Earth.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.390
I'll be frank, Mr. Beck,
because I'm in a bit of a hurry.

37:54.565 --> 37:55.645
I'm not here for you.

37:57.985 --> 38:00.772
I think you know
what I'm about to ask for.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.858
What's he talking about?

38:04.032 --> 38:06.193
You never told him?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.738
Told me what?

38:09.913 --> 38:11.119
Where is it?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.993
Please. Don't.

38:14.168 --> 38:16.534
Never told me what?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.875
We don't have much time.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.567
My business is finished here.
I'll leave the two of you.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.778
I'm sure you have plenty to discuss.

40:18.709 --> 40:22.577
Just got off with the CDC.
They've started vaccine protocol.

40:22.754 --> 40:27.839
Quarantined victims treated, along
with the passengers from those flights.

40:28.802 --> 40:33.421
The girl, Carrie Ann Beck,
she was taken off life support.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.259
Notify her next of kin.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.269
Tell them about the child.
