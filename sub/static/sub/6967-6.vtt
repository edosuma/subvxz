I've been looking ev...

Are you all right?

00:41.107 --> 00:42.699
Do you want some water?

00:42.776 --> 00:44.403
No. I'm fine.

Oh, honey, it's been

No. Really,Jane, I'm okay.

I just haven't known

00:55.922 --> 00:59.824

who have died, you know.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.885
I've never known anybody
that killed themselves.

01:02.962 --> 01:05.396
Maybe once everything
gets packed away

01:05.465 --> 01:07.092
it will get easier.

01:07.167 --> 01:10.102
There won't be
the constant reminder.

We hope your expertise

You're not F.B.I., are you?

Well, it can't be long.

05:04.336 --> 05:05.997
The body's still warm.

05:06.071 --> 05:09.529
Somatic death occurred
sometime over six hours ago

have yet to drop below 98.3.

you find them?

tell us

05:23.155 --> 05:24.952

of transport.

05:25.023 --> 05:27.457
That might help us
determine why the bodies

05:39.971 --> 05:43.498
Thank you.

05:43.575 --> 05:45.509
The most troubling aspect
of the deaths

05:45.577 --> 05:46.703
is the throat area.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.609
Larynx, esophagus,
and hyoid bone--

05:48.680 --> 05:49.942
all have been crushed

05:50.015 --> 05:51.846
like chalk.

05:51.917 --> 05:55.819
No abrasions, or evidence
of tissue damage.

05:55.887 --> 05:58.082
It's as if their throats
were crushed

05:58.156 --> 05:59.919

to this meeting be made

06:22.914 --> 06:26.475
we request full denial.

06:26.551 --> 06:30.351
I'd say you people already
suffer from full denial.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.392
You lied.

06:43.468 --> 06:45.698
You have seen it before.
I can tell.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.362
You lied to them.

06:47.439 --> 06:48.804
I would never lie.

06:48.874 --> 06:50.136

of misinformation.

06:52.010 --> 06:54.444
Who do you think
they were?

06:54.512 --> 06:56.241

some covert organization

06:56.314 --> 06:58.839
that Congress will uncover
in the next scandal.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.509
It's not important
who they are

07:00.585 --> 07:01.950
but what they have.

07:02.020 --> 07:05.148
I'm sure they have no idea,
because they called us in.

of what we saw tonight.

The Russians were
doing studies on it.

07:29.414 --> 07:30.881
The Chinese still are.

07:30.949 --> 07:32.849
Their findings
are kept secret.

07:37.255 --> 07:40.952
Okay, I'm intrigued
but how can we investigate?

is in charge now.

16:54.379 --> 16:58.645
was present
at both incidents?

16:58.716 --> 17:01.082
She was in our presence
the entire time.

17:01.152 --> 17:02.585
What if it's possible

17:02.653 --> 17:04.984
to raise the body's
electrostatic charge

17:05.056 --> 17:06.955
to the levels
we've been seeing

17:07.025 --> 17:09.084
and use that energy
to affect objects?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.287
If a person generated
that much energy

17:11.362 --> 17:12.954
their body
would break down.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.726
They'd glow
like those lights.

17:14.799 --> 17:17.199
There's evidence of this
in the X-Files--

17:17.268 --> 17:18.791
furniture moving untouched

17:18.869 --> 17:20.269
objects levitating

17:20.338 --> 17:22.499
unexplained
electrical discharges.

17:22.573 --> 17:25.440
Frequently, people who have
psychokinetic power

17:25.510 --> 17:27.773
are unaware
of their own capability.

17:27.845 --> 17:33.579
Are you saying
Lauren Kyte crashed our car?

17:33.651 --> 17:35.050
Either that...

17:35.119 --> 17:36.518
or a poltergeist.

17:36.587 --> 17:39.181
They're here.

17:39.257 --> 17:40.053
They may be.

17:40.124 --> 17:41.716
Mulder, look at

17:41.793 --> 17:43.590
the tangible evidence.

17:43.661 --> 17:46.596
Two mideast extremists
were killed

17:46.664 --> 17:48.791
trying to assault a woman

17:48.866 --> 17:50.766
working for
a manufacturer of parts

17:50.835 --> 17:52.564
for the Defense
Department.

17:52.637 --> 17:55.231
When we questioned her,
our car was sabotaged.

17:55.306 --> 17:58.798
In both cases, someone else
may have committed those acts--

17:58.876 --> 18:01.242
Maybe the same someone
from the ATM photos.

18:01.312 --> 18:06.113
The mystery isn't
psychokinetic energy.

18:06.184 --> 18:08.243
It's her accomplice.

18:34.512 --> 18:36.104
Excuse me.

18:37.415 --> 18:40.680
She's clean. No arrest,
not even a traffic ticket.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.218
The only thing is

18:42.286 --> 18:45.722
she's in deep with her
credit card company-- 1 5,000.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.451
What do you think
you're doing?

18:47.525 --> 18:50.016
Man:
I'm going to put that
on here.

18:50.094 --> 18:52.619
No, no. I'll take care
of this, all right?

18:52.697 --> 18:54.426
Here. I'll talk
to somebody.

18:54.499 --> 18:57.491
Mulder:
A little upset over
losing a parking space

18:57.568 --> 18:59.729
wouldn't you say?

19:02.173 --> 19:04.971
Who is Howard Graves, anyway?

19:20.992 --> 19:22.721
She was his secretary.

19:22.793 --> 19:25.353
That's three people dead
in the last month

19:25.429 --> 19:28.193
associated
with Lauren Kyte.

20:01.699 --> 20:03.690
You won't find
too many people

20:03.768 --> 20:06.965
at their boss' grave
who aren't dancing on it.

20:07.038 --> 20:08.869
Look at this one.

20:11.509 --> 20:13.943
[ water splashing ]

20:14.011 --> 20:15.205
Excuse me, sir?

20:15.279 --> 20:16.644
Is there an office

20:16.714 --> 20:19.182
where I can get some information

20:19.250 --> 20:20.911
on those people?

20:20.985 --> 20:23.215
Who? I attend
every funeral.

20:23.287 --> 20:26.984
I'm the last person
to see them put to rest.

20:27.058 --> 20:29.083
Do you know how Sarah Lynn

20:29.160 --> 20:32.231
was related
to Howard Graves?

20:32.364 --> 20:33.661
His daughter.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.858
They were at home one day

20:34.933 --> 20:38.460
and he didn't latch
the pool gate.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.027
She drowned.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.232
His wife left him
a year later.

20:42.307 --> 20:47.973
She's buried in a plot
in the northeast corner.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.513
Thank you, sir.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.446
You're welcome.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.817
She was only
three years old.

21:01.893 --> 21:05.420
If she had lived,
she'd be Lauren's age.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.695
Further investigation
into Lauren Kyte's
personal history...

21:37.763 --> 21:40.357
reveals an estrangement
from her family.

21:40.432 --> 21:44.528
Phone records confirm
no contact with her parents
for the last two years.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.537
Her actions,
observed during surveillance,

21:46.605 --> 21:49.540
indicate a strong relationship
between Lauren Kyte...

21:49.608 --> 21:52.771
and her employer,
the late Howard Graves.

21:52.844 --> 21:57.042
Was this relationship
somehow the motivation
for his suicide?

21:57.115 --> 22:00.983
How are the attack
and subsequent murders
of the Isfahan agents related,

22:01.053 --> 22:02.714
if at all?

22:02.788 --> 22:04.722
I am certain the answers
to these questions...

22:04.790 --> 22:08.385
lie in finding the identity
of Lauren Kyte's accomplice.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.176
Enhance it by ten.

22:40.158 --> 22:42.353
That's Howard Graves.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.952
He's alive.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.590
Not necessarily.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.474
[ hissing ]

23:06.551 --> 23:08.815
[ stairs creaking ]

24:02.307 --> 24:03.934
[ muffled voice ]

24:09.281 --> 24:11.306
Man: Don't do this to me.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.552
Howard.

24:21.326 --> 24:24.625
Howard: No. Stop. No, no!

24:24.696 --> 24:26.755
Please, no!

24:26.832 --> 24:28.925
[ moaning ]

[ sobbing ]

24:53.091 --> 24:55.924
[ panicked gasping ]

25:04.970 --> 25:07.268
Lauren: Howard.

25:09.808 --> 25:11.173
They killed him.

25:16.246 --> 25:18.976
I think Howard Graves
fabricated his own death.

25:19.049 --> 25:20.676
Do you know how difficult it is

25:20.751 --> 25:22.241
to fake your own death?

25:22.319 --> 25:24.082
Only one man
has pulled it off-- Elvis.

25:24.154 --> 25:26.122
He and Lauren Kyte
are in on something.

25:26.190 --> 25:28.488
Maybe an illegal dealing
through his company--

25:28.559 --> 25:30.527
something the C.I.A.
was interested in.

25:30.594 --> 25:31.856
You may be right.

25:31.929 --> 25:32.918
Wait.

25:32.997 --> 25:34.362
You think I'm right?

25:34.431 --> 25:35.864
Sure. All you got to do

25:35.933 --> 25:38.493
is prove Howard Graves
is still alive.

25:42.272 --> 25:45.639
Howard Graves is very dead.

25:45.709 --> 25:48.337
May we see
the autopsy report, please?

25:48.412 --> 25:50.972
Knock yourself out.

25:52.249 --> 25:54.911
Uh... " Cause of death,
arterial hemorrhage..."

25:54.985 --> 25:56.976
Bledsoe:
Four out of six liters of blood

25:57.054 --> 25:59.045
down the tub.

26:03.527 --> 26:06.553
Well, there seems to be
some blood work missing here.

26:06.630 --> 26:08.257
We only do that
if we suspect homicide.

26:08.332 --> 26:10.732
I don't suppose you ran
any dental confirmations?

26:10.801 --> 26:12.792
What for? It was him.

26:12.870 --> 26:13.928
How did you know?

26:14.004 --> 26:16.768
It said so on the toe tag.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.707
Who made positive I.D.
on the body?

26:19.777 --> 26:21.301
Um...

26:21.378 --> 26:23.403
Lauren Kyte.

26:26.550 --> 26:28.177
Mulder:
But he was cremated.

26:28.252 --> 26:30.220
There's no way
to run a dental check

26:30.287 --> 26:32.721
or get a DNA sample.

26:32.790 --> 26:34.690
Yes, there is.

26:34.758 --> 26:37.386
His body's tissues and organs
were donated.

26:41.532 --> 26:43.830
Man:
Howard Graves
is in five different people.

26:43.901 --> 26:45.869
They harvested the organs
immediately after death.

26:45.936 --> 26:47.597
His kidneys
were sent to Boston

26:47.671 --> 26:48.865
his liver to Dallas

26:48.939 --> 26:50.873
and his corneas
to Portland, Oregon.

26:50.941 --> 26:52.636
They've all
been transplanted.

26:52.709 --> 26:53.869
Because of his age

26:53.944 --> 26:56.105
we could only cryopreserve
the dura matter

26:56.180 --> 26:58.205
in the membrane
of the spinal column.

26:58.282 --> 27:00.341
We have Mr. Graves'
hospital records.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.351
We'll extract a sample,
run a test

27:02.419 --> 27:05.547
and in a couple of hours
confirm the identity
of the donor.

27:12.262 --> 27:16.596
I, uh, made them rush
so you could have your check

27:16.667 --> 27:18.396
before you leave.

27:18.469 --> 27:20.835
Oh. I'm going to miss you.

27:22.706 --> 27:24.731
Oh.

27:24.808 --> 27:26.901
Oh, what?

27:26.977 --> 27:28.774
Here.

27:30.547 --> 27:31.878
Good-bye.

28:16.693 --> 28:18.627
[ door closes ]

28:22.399 --> 28:24.196
You were going
to leave

28:24.268 --> 28:25.929
without saying good-bye?

28:27.838 --> 28:30.739
Well, uh, I came to say good-bye

28:30.807 --> 28:33.833
and to wish you luck...

28:33.911 --> 28:37.312
and to leave you
with this little thought.

28:37.381 --> 28:39.178
I know Howard told you

28:39.249 --> 28:41.114
and if it ever gets out

28:41.185 --> 28:45.087
I won't waste my time
trying to pin the source.

28:45.155 --> 28:46.782
I'll go straight to you.

28:46.857 --> 28:48.757
And you'll do to me what you did

28:48.825 --> 28:50.019
to Howard?

28:50.093 --> 28:52.584
I know you had him killed.

28:52.663 --> 28:54.153
Why would you say that?

28:54.231 --> 28:56.028
He told me.

be at my house?

Why?

29:25.395 --> 29:26.726
Please hurry.

29:32.369 --> 29:33.859
The tests are conclusive.

29:33.937 --> 29:36.701
The dura matter
does belong to Howard Graves.

32:20.436 --> 32:22.563
You're just here
for questioning.

32:22.638 --> 32:24.265
The sooner
you talk to us

32:24.340 --> 32:26.570
the sooner
you get to go home.

32:33.249 --> 32:34.477
What happened

32:34.550 --> 32:36.575
to those people tonight?

32:40.056 --> 32:42.524
Do you have any idea
who they might be?

32:44.794 --> 32:46.819
Why did they
attack you?

33:01.944 --> 33:04.037
Do you know who this is?

33:05.448 --> 33:07.712

an eye on her.

33:10.386 --> 33:11.478
Come on. Now.

33:16.158 --> 33:18.820
You've seriously compromised
our investigation.

33:18.895 --> 33:21.728
We were following leads
pertaining to an X-File.

33:21.797 --> 33:24.288
I want to know every detail
of your activities

33:24.367 --> 33:25.732
concerning this case.

33:25.801 --> 33:27.462
You're the ones
who have been

33:27.536 --> 33:28.935
withholding
information.

33:29.005 --> 33:31.371
Why don't you tell us
what you've got?

33:33.309 --> 33:36.039
Then we have nothing more
to talk about.

33:36.112 --> 33:37.443
Wait! We believe H.T.G.

33:37.513 --> 33:40.073
Industrial Technologies
sold restricted parts

33:40.149 --> 33:41.776
to the Isfahan.

33:41.851 --> 33:44.285
Serial numbers were recovered
in the wreckage

33:44.353 --> 33:46.378
of the bombing
of a navy transport van.

33:46.455 --> 33:48.047
How is Lauren Kyte involved?

33:48.124 --> 33:50.957
Your actions impeded
our investigation.

33:51.027 --> 33:53.825
We don't have enough evidence
to hold her.

33:53.896 --> 33:56.262
If she doesn't talk,
she goes free

33:56.332 --> 33:59.460
and we lose our chance
to break this company.

33:59.535 --> 34:01.025
I could make her talk.

34:01.103 --> 34:06.370
My advice to you:
don't get rough with her.

34:13.683 --> 34:15.617
That was a waste of time.

34:17.186 --> 34:18.915
Your turn.

34:28.264 --> 34:29.458
Lauren...

34:29.532 --> 34:32.659
I won't talk
to you either.

34:32.735 --> 34:36.136
Okay. Then you're free
to go.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.705
I can't go back
to that house.

34:46.782 --> 34:48.612
Why?

34:48.684 --> 34:50.618
Because of Howard Graves?

34:50.686 --> 34:51.675
He's dead.

34:51.754 --> 34:52.947
I know.

34:53.022 --> 34:55.855
He's watching over you,
isn't he?

35:02.298 --> 35:06.826
Lauren:
I don't know if you've ever
been a secretary before.

35:06.902 --> 35:09.336
Sometimes your boss can talk

35:09.405 --> 35:12.272
as if you weren't even
in the room

35:12.341 --> 35:14.434
which can hurt, you know.

35:14.510 --> 35:17.775
Sometimes you're all he has
to talk to

35:17.847 --> 35:21.783
which is how it always was
with me and Howard.

35:21.851 --> 35:25.343
One night, late,
I went into his office.

35:25.421 --> 35:28.652
He was crying,
more scared than sad.

35:28.724 --> 35:32.524
The Pentagon contracts
were being canceled.

35:32.595 --> 35:35.086
The company was going under.

35:35.164 --> 35:40.329
He felt personally responsible
for each of his employees.

35:40.403 --> 35:43.770
Seeing and feeling
their fear every day

35:43.839 --> 35:45.773
really wore him down.

35:45.841 --> 35:52.542
Then this one time,
Dorlund came with that group--

35:52.615 --> 35:56.745
that mideast group-- Isfahan.

35:56.819 --> 36:00.277
They'd buy parts
at an outrageous price--

36:00.356 --> 36:01.550
not just once--

36:01.624 --> 36:05.253
for as long as they
could get away with it.

36:05.327 --> 36:09.764
That night Howard was crying,
he had just found out

36:09.832 --> 36:13.029
that Isfahan
had claimed responsibility

36:13.102 --> 36:16.503
for killing a couple sailors
in Florida.

36:16.572 --> 36:18.767
He was never the same

36:19.975 --> 36:23.672
and I thought
that's why he killed himself...

36:25.281 --> 36:26.771
but he didn't.

36:26.849 --> 36:28.612
I saw...

36:32.455 --> 36:35.481
Howard showed me how
Dorlund had him killed.

36:35.558 --> 36:38.118
Made it look like a suicide,
'cause he could see

36:38.194 --> 36:40.492
Howard was going
to put an end to the deal.

36:40.563 --> 36:42.963
So now Howard
is protecting you?

36:43.032 --> 36:45.466
It sounds so ridiculous.

36:45.534 --> 36:46.796
But you believe it?

36:46.869 --> 36:50.305
He was closer to me
than my father.

36:50.372 --> 36:52.738
I told him that.

36:52.808 --> 36:55.902
I still feel his presence.

36:55.978 --> 37:01.109
Sometimes...
I even smell his after-shave.

37:04.053 --> 37:09.685
If you just could have... seen
the things I've seen.

37:12.761 --> 37:16.322
I just want all that to go away.

37:16.398 --> 37:18.161
That's why I'm leaving.

37:18.234 --> 37:19.997
Maybe he can move on.

37:23.339 --> 37:26.240
That's not enough.

37:26.308 --> 37:29.607
You have been given the chance
to tell him again.

37:29.678 --> 37:31.543
Take it.

37:31.614 --> 37:35.948
Tell him you love him
by showing him...

37:36.018 --> 37:40.580
by... by helping us finish
his unfinished business.

37:40.656 --> 37:43.591
Lauren,
how will you ever

37:43.659 --> 37:47.151
be able to rest
if he never can?

37:49.865 --> 37:51.332
Okay.

37:56.539 --> 37:58.006
I'm a mess.

37:58.073 --> 38:01.565
I'm going to, uh... wash up.

38:11.353 --> 38:13.184
What are you doing, Scully?

38:13.255 --> 38:14.688
You don't believe.

38:14.757 --> 38:18.818
Mulder, there's no such things
as ghosts or psychokinesis.

38:18.894 --> 38:23.422
I'm sure there's an explanation,
but I believe that she believes

38:23.499 --> 38:27.367
and my priority is to get her
to help us stop Dorlund.

38:27.436 --> 38:30.462
Well, we may have just
sacrificed our best opportunity

38:30.539 --> 38:32.166
to observe spectral phenomena.

38:32.241 --> 38:36.405
No, I'm giving us the chance
to solve a case that's tangible

38:36.478 --> 38:38.844
instead of chasing
after shadows.

38:44.220 --> 38:47.224
[ door opens and shuts ]

38:59.436 --> 39:00.926
Are you ready?

39:02.138 --> 39:03.366
All right, everyone

39:03.440 --> 39:06.068
we have a warrant
to search the premises

39:06.142 --> 39:08.474
for evidence
pertaining to the sale

39:08.545 --> 39:10.672
of restricted
manufactured parts.

39:10.747 --> 39:12.715
The evidence
may be in the form

39:12.782 --> 39:16.775
of falsified export licenses,
parts manifests, communiqués.

39:16.853 --> 39:19.617
It could be on computer disk
or hard copy.

39:19.689 --> 39:21.213
Once there,
if in doubt, ask.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.724
We need this to be clean.

39:22.792 --> 39:25.761
This is the culmination
of a yearlong investigation.

39:25.829 --> 39:28.730
If we don't come out
of there today with something

39:28.798 --> 39:30.732
proving a connection
to the Isfahan

39:30.800 --> 39:31.892
this guy could walk.

39:31.968 --> 39:33.401
Okay, let's go.

39:36.039 --> 39:37.802
You okay?

39:37.874 --> 39:40.536
It will most likely be
in Dorlund's office.

39:40.610 --> 39:44.273
We'll execute the search,
but we'll need you to guide us

39:44.347 --> 39:46.508
so you have
to be strong, okay?

40:02.832 --> 40:04.561
Scully:
Everybody stay calm.

40:04.634 --> 40:06.659
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

40:06.736 --> 40:10.297
Ma'am, could you back away
from those files, please?

40:41.571 --> 40:43.129
This is all we could find.

40:43.206 --> 40:44.230
We don't have him.

40:44.307 --> 40:46.172
He's not even
breaking a sweat.

40:46.242 --> 40:48.301
Webster:
Our case is blown.

40:48.378 --> 40:50.278
We've wasted a year.

40:50.347 --> 40:52.941
This guy's going to walk.

41:02.058 --> 41:03.958
Let's get out of here.

41:07.330 --> 41:11.357
Mulder: Lauren, it's over.
we have to go.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.860
What we're looking for
isn't here.

41:14.938 --> 41:16.735
Dorlund:
She's no agent.

41:16.806 --> 41:18.671
I've been more than cooperative.

41:18.742 --> 41:20.369
She has no right

41:20.443 --> 41:23.105
to destroy
my personal property.

41:23.179 --> 41:27.047
What about that van that blew up
and killed those servicemen?

41:27.117 --> 41:29.085
I don't know
what you're talking about

41:29.152 --> 41:30.449
you stupid bitch!

41:30.520 --> 41:32.454
Lauren, no!

41:39.696 --> 41:41.789
Lauren: Don't kill him!

41:41.865 --> 41:43.594
Help us find it!

41:45.168 --> 41:47.796
[ lights explode ]

41:56.546 --> 41:57.945
Mulder!

42:30.647 --> 42:32.239
Oh, my god.

42:45.728 --> 42:49.459
Mulder: I guess what we're
looking for is here.

42:56.005 --> 42:57.836
The U.S. Attorney's Office

42:57.907 --> 43:01.502
is going after Dorlund
with everything they've got

43:01.578 --> 43:04.240
including the murder
of Howard Graves.

43:04.314 --> 43:06.145
I'll come back
to testify.

43:06.216 --> 43:07.706
Where you going?

43:07.784 --> 43:09.251
Away from here.

43:14.390 --> 43:16.449
[ engine starting ]

43:16.526 --> 43:18.084
Thanks.

43:24.701 --> 43:27.329
Boy, she's in a rush
to get out of here.

43:27.403 --> 43:31.169
Out of here, or away from
the ghost of Howard Graves?

43:33.443 --> 43:36.003
Hey, Scully, do you believe
in an afterlife?

43:36.079 --> 43:39.378
I'd settle for a life
in this one.

43:39.449 --> 43:41.781
You ever seen
the Liberty Bell?

43:41.851 --> 43:43.250
Yes.

43:44.954 --> 43:46.785
I've been to Philadelphia
1 00 times

43:46.856 --> 43:48.187
and I've never seen it.

43:48.258 --> 43:49.520
You're not missing much.

43:49.592 --> 43:51.321
It's a big bell
with a big crack

43:51.394 --> 43:53.362
and you have to wait
in a long line.

43:53.429 --> 43:57.160
I'd really like
to go.

43:58.635 --> 44:00.068
Why now?

44:00.136 --> 44:01.899
I don't know.

44:01.971 --> 44:03.336
How late do you think
they stay open?

44:15.218 --> 44:19.245
Miss Kyte, I asked for this
25 minutes ago.

44:19.322 --> 44:20.448
I know. I'm sorry.

44:20.523 --> 44:22.616
Maybe that's the way
they work back East

44:22.692 --> 44:25.957
but here in the Midwest,
punctuality is a virtue.

44:32.201 --> 44:34.669
We really have to find
a new office space.

44:34.737 --> 44:36.295
Every time a truck goes by

44:36.372 --> 44:38.840
the whole building shakes.

44:41.611 --> 44:43.169
That's all, Lauren.
