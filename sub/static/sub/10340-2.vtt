WEBVTT

02:04.999 --> 02:09.419
Diane, 6:18 a.m., Room 315.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.214
Great Northern Hotel
up here in Twin Peaks.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.425
Slept pretty well. Non-smoking room.
There's no tobacco smell.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.512
That's a nice consideration
for the business traveler.

02:18.721 --> 02:22.599
A hint of Douglas fir needles
in the air.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.351
As Sheriff Truman
indicated they would,

02:24.561 --> 02:26.728
everything this hotel promised,
they've delivered.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.023
Clean, reasonably priced
accommodations.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.901
Telephone works.
Bathroom in really tiptop shape.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.320
No drips, plenty of hot water
and good, steady pressure.

02:35.530 --> 02:39.074
That could be a side benefit
of the waterfall outside my window.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.868
Mattress firm, but not too firm.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.662
And no lumps like that time
I told you about down in El Paso.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.873
What a nightmare that was.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.041
But you've heard me
tell that story once or twice,

02:48.251 --> 02:49.376
haven't you, Diane?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.378
Haven't tried the television set yet.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.173
Looks like cable,
probably no reception problems.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.885
But the true test of any hotel,
as you well know, Diane,

02:58.094 --> 02:59.386
is that morning cup of coffee,

02:59.596 --> 03:02.097
which I'll be getting back to you
about within a half hour.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.360
Diane, it struck me again
earlier this morning.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.404
There are two things
that continue to trouble me

03:17.614 --> 03:19.781
and I'm speaking now
not only as an agent of the Bureau,

03:19.991 --> 03:22.409
but also as a human being.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.705
What really went on between
Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?

03:26.915 --> 03:30.083
And who really pulled the trigger
on JFK?

03:34.589 --> 03:37.049
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:48.394 --> 03:53.523
You know, this is, excuse me,
a damn fine cup of coffee.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.818
I've had I can't tell you how many cups
of coffee in my life and this...

03:57.028 --> 03:58.987
This is one of the best.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.240
Now, I'd like two eggs, over hard.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.825
I know, don't tell me,
it's hard on the arteries.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.202
But old habits die hard.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.079
Just about as hard
as I want those eggs.

04:07.288 --> 04:11.917
Bacon, super crispy, almost burned.
Cremate it.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.169
That's great.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.797
And I'll have the grapefruit juice.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.757
Just as long as those grapefruits...

04:20.843 --> 04:22.469
...are freshly squeezed.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.848
My name's Audrey Horne.

04:30.478 --> 04:34.189
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.319
Can I sit here?

04:40.154 --> 04:41.863
Well, Miss Horne,
unless I miss my guess,

04:42.073 --> 04:45.075
your father is Benjamin Horne,
the owner of this fine establishment.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.744
So I imagine you can sit
anywhere you'd like.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.080
I'd also like to add
it would be my pleasure.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.124
Thank you.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.213
You're here investigating
the murder of Laura Palmer?

04:58.423 --> 05:00.215
Were you friends with Laura Palmer?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.803
Not exactly.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.348
See, Laura tutored my older brother,
Johnny, three times a week.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.977
Johnny's 27
and he's in the third grade.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.854
He's got emotional problems.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.231
Runs in the family.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.066
Do you like my ring?

05:20.903 --> 05:21.945
Very nice.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.662
You know, sometimes
I get so flushed, it's interesting.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.207
Do your palms ever itch?

05:48.222 --> 05:49.556
Morning, deputy. Hey, Lucy.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.391
Good morning, Agent Cooper.

05:51.559 --> 05:55.145
Agent Cooper,
I got jelly for you special.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.648
The sheriff's in the conference room.
It's the door across from the...

05:58.858 --> 06:01.109
I'll look for him
in the conference room.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.907
Hey, three for three.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.869
Sheriff, let's get James Hurley up
from cell 4 and talk to him straight.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.830
He was in love with Laura Palmer.
My bet is she told him whatever dirt

06:13.998 --> 06:16.124
she knew about Mike and Bobby
and who knows what else.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.543
Then let's have a little chat
with those two perpetrators.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.463
Let's run a top-to-bottom on Bobby's
vehicle, see what that brings us.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.256
Also check on the autopsy
on Laura Palmer

06:23.424 --> 06:24.758
and see what that brings in.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.094
We're also gonna wanna talk
to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer,

06:27.303 --> 06:29.304
let's give them a few days
to deal with their grief.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.599
I've got the rest of our day mapped out,
let's meet back here in three minutes.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.559
Harry, I really have to urinate.

06:35.269 --> 06:38.021
Oh. By the way,
coffee at the Great Northern?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.481
Incredible.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.534
Harry, as you know,
I delivered Laura.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.162
I've known her all her life.
She was my daughter's best friend.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.249
I couldn't bring myself
to do the postmortem,

06:57.458 --> 07:01.586
so I called Joe Fielding in
from Fairvale.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.506
He did the work, I assisted.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.008
Well, this is what he found.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.971
Time of death estimated
to be between midnight and 4 a.m.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.640
What killed her is loss of blood.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.975
Numerous shallow wounds,

07:15.184 --> 07:18.645
no single one serious enough
to have caused death.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.941
Bite marks on her shoulders,
also on her tongue.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.695
Probably self-inflicted.

07:27.488 --> 07:31.741
Lesions on wrists, ankles, upper arms,
where she was bound.

07:31.951 --> 07:36.997
We're waiting on the toxological tests
for drug use.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.834
Within the last 12 hours,

07:41.043 --> 07:45.422
she'd had sexual relations
with at least three men.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.800
You've examined
Ronnette Pulaski as well?

07:49.010 --> 07:52.304
Yes, sir.
There's no question in my mind.

07:52.513 --> 07:57.017
The same perpetrator attacked
both of them in that train car.

07:57.226 --> 08:02.272
Doc, when, if ever,
will Ronnette be able to talk to us?

08:02.482 --> 08:07.486
She had a severe head injury,
it's still early to tell.

08:07.695 --> 08:13.575
Add to that
the psychological impact of the fear,

08:17.121 --> 08:20.957
probably witnessing what was
happening to Laura before she...

08:25.087 --> 08:27.380
So beautiful.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.679
Who would do a thing like that?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.017
Leo.

08:41.437 --> 08:45.607
Leo, honey, I have to go to work now
and Norma should be here any sec.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.735
Leo?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.279
Did you finish cleaning my boots?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.950
Yeah, I did them
and I did the laundry too.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.118
All of it?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.579
Well, yeah.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.291
No, you didn't.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.923
Okay, Leo, when I get home,
I'll do it.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.092
Now, Shelly.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.638
Okay.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.538
Blood.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.624
Shelly? Norma's here.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.507
Shelly, did you hear me say
Norma's here?

09:52.717 --> 09:55.176
Yeah, I heard you, Leo.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.975
I'm gonna come by the diner
sometime today.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.316
Be a good girl
and save me a piece of pie.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.154
Sure, Leo.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.125
James, you were placed under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.501
The murder of Laura Palmer.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.296
Now, you have no previous
criminal record, is that correct?

10:31.505 --> 10:32.964
None. No, sir.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.308
Did you shoot this video?

10:52.568 --> 10:54.653
That's your cycle, isn't it?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.909
Yes, sir.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.578
The three of us went up there
two Sundays ago.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.792
James, you were in love with Laura.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.087
The two of you
were seeing each other secretly.

11:12.713 --> 11:16.591
No one else at school
or any of her friends knew about it.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.677
She was the homecoming queen,

11:18.886 --> 11:21.471
she was dating the captain
of the football team.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.889
How much longer did you think

11:23.099 --> 11:24.849
you could keep this relationship
a secret?

11:26.435 --> 11:29.688
Yeah, well, it was secret
because that's the way she wanted it.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.066
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

11:35.611 --> 11:37.445
I think so.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.699
Did you know
she was using cocaine?

11:42.451 --> 11:43.910
Yes.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.413
Did you ever use cocaine with her?

11:46.622 --> 11:48.164
No, I tried to get her to stop.

11:48.374 --> 11:52.419
- And she did for a while.
- Why did she start using again?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.381
Something happened
a couple of days ago.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.550
What? What happened?

12:00.010 --> 12:01.803
I don't know.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.265
I think something scared her
because she wouldn't see me.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.891
She wouldn't even talk to me.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.942
When was the last time you saw her?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.321
The night she died.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.451
She snuck out of her house
about 9:30.

12:24.660 --> 12:29.038
About 12:30, I stopped the bike
at the light at Sparkwood and 21.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.792
And she jumped off and ran away.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.840
I didn't see her again.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.138
Did you and Laura have a fight?

12:46.348 --> 12:48.266
Not exactly.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.352
But she said
she couldn't see me anymore.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.812
Why?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.858
She didn't say.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.115
You recognize this necklace?

13:07.703 --> 13:09.370
Yes, sir.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.008
James, what happened
on February 5th?

13:22.218 --> 13:26.054
And who has the other half
of this heart?

13:32.061 --> 13:35.522
James, guess why
I'm so happy today.

13:35.731 --> 13:40.026
Because your skin is so soft
and you smell so good?

13:40.236 --> 13:43.404
- No.
- Why?

13:47.743 --> 13:51.913
Because I really believe
that you love me.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.254
Now my heart belongs to you.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.635
I don't know.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.100
Damn it.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.813
Where's that shirt?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.278
No!

14:33.956 --> 14:35.123
Hey, Bopper.

14:35.332 --> 14:39.085
Since when does Leo Johnson
call me at my parents' house?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.713
Leo called you?

14:41.922 --> 14:44.924
Yeah, yesterday.
He was looking for you.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.386
He wanted to know where
the other half of the money was.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.223
What did you tell him, Snake?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.475
Well, as far as I knew,
he didn't have any of it yet.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.852
Because I thought the deal was

14:56.061 --> 14:58.021
we were supposed to give it to him
today.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.523
Yeah, well,

15:01.150 --> 15:03.651
I gave him half already.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.782
When did you see him?

15:09.992 --> 15:14.203
- Hey, I saw him the other night, okay?
- What night?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.290
The night Laura died.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.958
I went to see Leo

15:19.168 --> 15:24.213
because I had this money burning
a $10,000 hole in my pocket.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.091
What about the other half?

15:28.677 --> 15:33.222
- It's in Laura's safe-deposit box.
- So you didn't get it back from her?

15:34.350 --> 15:35.850
She was supposed
to hand it over today.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.435
Then she went
and checked out on us.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.688
So how are we supposed to get
10 grand for Leo?

15:40.898 --> 15:41.940
I don't know, Snake.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.900
Maybe we could sell light bulbs
door to door.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.069
Oh, that's great, that's just...
That's just great.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.364
- This isn't funny, Bobby.
- I'm not laughing.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.199
We're lucky.
We're lucky we're in jail.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.868
Because you know what's gonna go
down with Leo when we get out.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.119
Shut up, man.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.913
Don't mention one word
about Leo Johnson.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.625
You do not know Leo Johnson.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.721
Help me.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.685
Mom.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.146
Hi, honey.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.981
Mom, it's 10:30.
Why didn't you wake me?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.733
I was supposed to go
to the sheriff's office.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.026
They called this morning

17:08.235 --> 17:10.820
and said they could wait
until tomorrow to see you.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.406
Your father and I thought
you needed your rest.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.616
You woke us crying in your sleep
last night.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.454
- Do you remember?
- No.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.164
Really?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.958
We feel so badly for you.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.752
We're so sorry.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.547
Mom, it's so strange.

17:32.092 --> 17:36.512
I know I should be sad, and I am.
Part of me is.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.016
But it's like...

17:41.185 --> 17:44.687
It's like I'm having
the most beautiful dream

17:46.065 --> 17:48.566
and the most terrible nightmare
all at once.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.693
Your father said
you went out last night

17:50.903 --> 17:52.570
to meet a boy named James Hurley.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.447
Does this have anything to do
with him?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.407
Can this be between you and me?

17:56.617 --> 17:58.201
Of course it can.

17:59.244 --> 18:03.289
James and Laura were seeing
each other the last two months.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.958
I was the only one
who knew about it.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.836
Mom, James was so good for her.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.047
You don't know how troubled
Laura was.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.424
Last night, I had to see him.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.220
We were the two closest people
in the world to her.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.349
But I feel so bad now.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.434
Why, angel?

18:25.521 --> 18:29.023
Because we realized...

18:30.567 --> 18:33.402
...that all this time...

18:34.822 --> 18:37.824
...we were the ones falling in love.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.414
So I feel like
I've betrayed my best friend.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.461
And if it's true,

18:52.798 --> 18:55.341
then why am I so happy?

18:56.426 --> 18:57.635
Oh, honey.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.270
Now, you tell me what you wanna do.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.231
Should we see these guys
separately or together?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.275
- No, no, we can see them together.
- Okay.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.278
Hey, Ed.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.739
- How's that coconut?
- Well, it's kind of tender.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.616
But my pride hurts worse.

19:20.826 --> 19:24.078
Ed, this is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.247
- Pleasure.
- Any relation to James?

19:26.456 --> 19:29.125
I'm his uncle
and he works in my garage.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.878
His mother's out of town
and I look after him when she's away.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.921
You fellas plan on holding him?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.258
No, we can, uh,
release him into your custody.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.677
Well, let me understand.
Is James being charged?

19:39.887 --> 19:42.305
Well, I had one small doubt
which he cleared up for me.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.931
He didn't kill anybody.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.308
But you tell him to be careful

19:45.517 --> 19:48.269
because we're gonna have to release
Mike and Bobby today as well.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.021
- Will do.
- Agent Cooper,

19:50.230 --> 19:53.191
I've got a call for you
from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.942
Sounds like long distance.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.195
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

19:57.404 --> 20:01.449
It has that open air sound, you know,
where it sounds like wind blowing?

20:01.658 --> 20:03.993
- Like wind blowing through trees.
- Yes, Albert.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.246
Harry, I've been thinking
about last night at the Roadhouse.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.748
And something's not right.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.374
Yeah, when I first saw that bandage,

20:10.584 --> 20:13.628
I thought maybe old Nadine
caught wind of you and Norma.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.463
Harry, if Nadine got wind of me
and Norma,

20:15.672 --> 20:17.632
I'd be playing harp
for the Heavenly All-Stars.

20:17.841 --> 20:18.883
Ain't that the truth?

20:19.092 --> 20:22.386
I was there seeing Norma,
but I was also on my stakeout.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.805
And I can remember Mike and Bobby
grabbing Donna

20:25.015 --> 20:28.809
and I got up to walk over
and I got all lightheaded.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.020
I was out on my feet
before I got there.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.813
I don't even remember getting hit.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.649
What do you mean
you don't remember?

20:34.858 --> 20:36.651
Well, I'm pretty sure
my beer was drugged.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.486
Jacques Renault was tending bar.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.241
All right, Albert, bring the boys.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.493
You can have the body
all day tomorrow.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.746
No, I can't do it, they're gonna put her
in the ground on Monday.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.040
Albert, listen.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.002
If you come up through Lewis Fork,
I can recommend a place for lunch.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.338
The Lamplighter Inn.

20:57.547 --> 21:02.301
They got a cherry pie there
that'll kill you.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.571
- Hi, Nadine.
- What are you doing here, Norma?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.907
I might ask you the same question.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.826
And I will tell you.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.996
I've gotten all new drapes
for my house.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.623
Ed bought them for me yesterday
at Gentleman Jim's.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.042
And we installed them together.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.794
They're a beige sheer.

21:37.879 --> 21:41.549
I was up all last night.
Do you know what I was doing?

21:42.634 --> 21:43.759
No, I don't.

21:43.969 --> 21:49.181
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.436
And do you know how it works?
Do you know what makes it work?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.604
The thing I thought of
at 4 this morning

21:55.814 --> 21:59.775
when I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.323
Cotton balls.

22:07.617 --> 22:11.704
By God,
those things will be quiet now.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.552
Did you have to post bail?

22:26.762 --> 22:29.847
No, I had a talk with Harry.
There's no charge.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.433
Mom still out of town?

22:32.642 --> 22:36.103
Yeah, she's still out of town.
Let's get out of here.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.022
Gonna need a hand
from the Bookhouse Boys.

22:38.231 --> 22:42.693
- Somebody's gotta watch my back.
- Already got it covered.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.656
Hi, Mike.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.492
Bobby.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.287
Well, before we get started, have you
two fellas got your stories straight?

22:53.914 --> 22:59.251
If we tell the truth, we don't have
to get our stories straight.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.837
Besides, the sheriff told us
we're just in here for fighting.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.964
And, uh, it was self-defense.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.175
Right.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.844
Well, I guess you can go, then.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.598
- Now?
Mm-hm.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.438
Oh, fellas, one more thing.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.440
Pray for the health and safety
of James Hurley

23:21.650 --> 23:25.528
because if anything happens to him,
we're coming for you.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.159
Sheriff,
what are you sitting around for?

23:32.369 --> 23:33.869
We got places to go
and people to see.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.913
Yeah, I think I better start
studying medicine.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.164
Why's that?

23:37.374 --> 23:41.127
Because I'm beginning to feel
a bit like Dr. Watson.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.888
On top of the morning to you, Pete.

23:54.057 --> 23:59.562
Uh, no, Josie, the expression
is "top of the morning."

23:59.771 --> 24:02.815
And it's just barely morning.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.653
Pete,

24:08.405 --> 24:13.284
I want to thank you for yesterday.
For standing up to me with Catherine.

24:13.493 --> 24:18.873
Forget it.
Catherine was wrong yesterday.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.293
- Period.
- Well, thank you anyway.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.756
- Hello.
- Pete, it's Harry.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.718
I got Agent Cooper with me.
We're here to see Mrs. Packard.

24:34.681 --> 24:38.767
Um, I will make a fresh pot of coffee.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.611
- Hi, sheriff.
- Mrs. Packard.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.529
Dale Cooper, FBI.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.073
You remember him from
the town meeting last night, I'm sure.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.575
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.368
Agent Cooper,
you remember Pete Martell.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.370
- Sure, Pete.
- You bet.

24:58.538 --> 25:01.207
Uh, can we offer you gentlemen
a cup of joe?

25:01.416 --> 25:03.167
Mrs. Packard,
you said the magic word.

25:03.376 --> 25:07.546
- I'd love a cup, thanks.
- Sure, I'll pour that for you.

25:07.964 --> 25:11.675
Uh, Mr. Cooper, uh,
how do you take it?

25:11.885 --> 25:15.179
Black as midnight
on a moonless night.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.388
Pretty black.

25:16.556 --> 25:20.351
- Um, please sit down.
- Thank you.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.856
Mrs. Packard,
I'll come straight to the point.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.192
Mrs. Packard, I understand
that you hired Laura Palmer

25:28.401 --> 25:31.445
to come visit you twice a week to help
you with your English, is that correct?

25:31.655 --> 25:33.113
Yes.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.116
When was the last time
that you saw her?

25:36.326 --> 25:40.037
Thursday afternoon,
about the time the mill blew 5.

25:40.247 --> 25:43.207
- That would be 5:00?
- Yes.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.458
And when did she leave?

25:45.293 --> 25:47.711
In an hour,
when the lesson was finished.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.047
I didn't see her again.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.758
How did she seem to you
on Thursday afternoon?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.843
Something was bothering her.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.556
But we didn't have
a heart-to-heart on it.

25:59.224 --> 26:03.602
Something she said though,
that stuck on my mind.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.272
She said,

26:06.481 --> 26:10.651
"I think now I understand how you feel
about your husband's death."

26:12.112 --> 26:14.238
Did she say
what that was in reference to?

26:14.447 --> 26:16.574
No.

26:16.783 --> 26:22.371
But after what happened to her,
I can't help hearing it in my head.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.456
Like some haunting melody.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.626
Hmm.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.005
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.802
So, Harry,
how long you been seeing her?

26:40.557 --> 26:42.099
How did you know?

26:42.309 --> 26:44.143
Body language.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.605
Jeez Louise.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.735
Not long. Six weeks.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.864
Andrew died a year and a half ago.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.953
Fellas, don't drink that coffee.

27:03.747 --> 27:10.002
You'd never guess.
There was a fish in the percolator.

27:13.506 --> 27:14.757
Sorry.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.728
Yes, Catherine, I'm listening.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.355
I just thought you ought to know

27:29.564 --> 27:33.150
what your sentimental, goodwill
shenanigans cost us yesterday.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.402
You do know what shenanigans are,
don't you?

27:37.197 --> 27:42.409
Shutting down the mill
cost us $87,000 and change.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.872
You really think that would have made
brother Andrew happy.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.071
Jocelyn? Mrs. Packard?

28:19.239 --> 28:23.200
Uh, what is "shenanigans?"

28:23.827 --> 28:28.539
Nonsense, mischief,
often a deceitful or treacherous trick.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.421
Why do you always have
to rush off?

28:35.630 --> 28:38.090
It's been over an hour.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.550
I remember there was a time

28:39.759 --> 28:42.970
when we used to take
the whole afternoon.

28:43.179 --> 28:49.143
In the sweetness of passing time,
this hour will soon seem like a day.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.814
Sing it to somebody else.
I'm no peabrain chambermaid

28:54.023 --> 28:56.191
looking for a tumble
in the broom closet.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.235
I'm sorry.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.821
Didn't mean to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.656
Oh, no. My mistake.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.034
I'd gotten used to our
conducting business and pleasure.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.370
Sweetheart,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.206
it's all the same to me.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.544
Don't "sweetheart" me, you old dog.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.756
I'm no schoolgirl either.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.925
What's the next step?

29:22.135 --> 29:23.844
Do we escalate?

29:24.053 --> 29:26.263
We may not have to do anything.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.475
A few more, uh, local tragedies

29:29.684 --> 29:33.896
and Josie might just run the old mill
into the ground all by herself.

29:35.231 --> 29:39.193
The rate we're going, it's gonna be
years before the mill's bankrupt.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.611
I don't wanna wait any longer.

29:40.820 --> 29:45.032
Besides, my knothead husband
may peek in the ledger

29:45.241 --> 29:48.035
and sniff out the creative arithmetic.

29:49.454 --> 29:53.582
Maybe it's time to, uh,
start a little fire.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.543
Are you talking about business
or pleasure?

29:58.254 --> 30:02.424
I'm talking about
the Packard sawmill.

30:06.429 --> 30:11.892
All that dry timber lying around.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.436
A stray spark.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.772
One night.

30:16.981 --> 30:21.777
Some night when Pete's off on a toot
with Smokey the Bear.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.239
Now I remember...

30:26.366 --> 30:32.287
...how all those hours
turned into days.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.803
Sarah, darling.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.431
I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart,

30:51.641 --> 30:53.767
but, uh, Donna Hayward is here.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.562
Take this now.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.606
I'll send her in.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.613
- Try not to upset her.
- Okay.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.380
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

31:26.092 --> 31:29.678
I miss her so much.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.848
Do you miss her?

31:33.057 --> 31:36.685
Yes, I miss her so much.

31:39.981 --> 31:49.489
I miss her so much.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.961
Laura.

32:03.171 --> 32:08.508
Oh, Laura, my baby.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.553
Oh. Oh.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.358
Leland, Leland.

32:41.584 --> 32:45.170
So neither of you saw Ronnette
after school that day?

32:47.090 --> 32:48.423
That's right.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.218
And as far as you know,
she went to her after-school job?

32:51.427 --> 32:54.930
Yes, Horne's Department Store
downtown.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.933
What did she do
at the department store?

32:59.268 --> 33:05.273
She was, uh, a salesgirl.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.901
At perfume counter.

33:08.987 --> 33:13.490
She used to joke it was the
sweetest smelling job she'd ever had.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.003
Excuse me.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.747
How many times have I asked you

34:43.956 --> 34:48.627
not to disturb the guests
with this racket?

34:49.128 --> 34:51.463
About 4000.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.182
Audrey,

35:05.186 --> 35:12.025
Julie tells me that, uh,
you were in with the Norwegians

35:12.235 --> 35:16.696
just before they all suddenly decided,
en masse,

35:16.906 --> 35:19.407
to return to the old country...

35:20.785 --> 35:25.163
...without signing the contracts.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.082
Is that true?

35:27.667 --> 35:30.001
- Yes.
- Ah.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.713
You wouldn't have, uh,
done or said anything

35:33.923 --> 35:39.219
that, uh, might have precipitated
their evacuation, would you?

35:39.428 --> 35:43.974
I mean, I'm assuming
that this was just a coincidence.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.893
- Huh?
- Daddy.

35:47.854 --> 35:52.190
I did go in there to check out
that ridiculous smorgasbord.

35:53.276 --> 35:57.154
And while I was in there,
I happened to mention that I was sad.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.868
About what?

36:04.704 --> 36:09.291
About my dear, close friend Laura
being brutally murdered.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.716
Do you realize

36:17.925 --> 36:22.470
the kind of money that your
little performance just cost this family?

36:24.348 --> 36:28.518
If you ever pull
another stunt like that,

36:28.728 --> 36:31.479
you are going to be scrubbing bidets
in a Bulgarian convent.

36:31.689 --> 36:34.983
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.699
Laura died two days ago.

36:44.493 --> 36:47.495
I lost you years ago.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.892
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.101
Amen.

37:11.854 --> 37:14.314
Robert, uh, I was hoping
we'd have the chance

37:14.523 --> 37:16.650
to discuss the events
of the past few days.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.527
Not necessarily
the physical events themselves,

37:19.737 --> 37:23.406
but rather, the thoughts
and feelings surrounding it.

37:24.825 --> 37:29.579
Rebellion in a young man your age
is a necessary fact of life.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.082
Candidly, a sign of strength.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.084
In other words, Robert,

37:34.293 --> 37:37.003
I respect your rebellious nature.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.047
However, being your father,

37:39.257 --> 37:42.342
I am obligated to contain
that fire of contrariness

37:42.551 --> 37:44.386
within the bounds
established by society

37:45.346 --> 37:47.722
as well as those
within our own family structure.

37:50.726 --> 37:54.896
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter
into a dialogue with me, your father.

37:56.065 --> 37:59.109
There are times
when silence is golden.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.862
Silence can be taken many ways,
as a sign of intelligence.

38:03.072 --> 38:07.784
The quieter we become,
the more we hear.

38:08.327 --> 38:09.411
Ah!

38:10.997 --> 38:15.709
Now, I am a tolerant man.
My patience has its limits.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.878
To have his path made clear
is the aspiration of every human being

38:19.088 --> 38:22.716
in our beclouded
and tempestuous existence.

38:23.342 --> 38:26.219
Robert, you and I are going to work
to make yours real clear.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.395
We're here for you, Bobby.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.281
Can I get you anything
to go with that, sheriff?

38:46.490 --> 38:49.826
Agent Cooper here might wanna try
a slice of that pie.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.912
- Cherry pie?
- Best in the tri-counties.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.748
Hmm.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.667
And could you ask Norma
to stop by a second, Shelly?

38:57.877 --> 39:00.253
- Sure thing.
- Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.967
Man, I still can't get the taste
of that fish-filtered coffee

39:06.177 --> 39:08.970
- out of my mouth.
- Me neither.

39:10.264 --> 39:13.558
- That's Shelly Johnson, with a J?
- Mm-hm.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.269
Husband's a trucker, Leo.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.229
Minor rap sheet.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.780
Log Lady?

39:26.989 --> 39:29.449
- Right.
- Hi.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.162
Can I ask her about her log?

39:34.789 --> 39:36.831
Many have.

39:39.627 --> 39:40.668
Evening, Harry.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.381
Norma, like to have you meet
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

39:44.590 --> 39:45.840
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.592
Norma Jennings.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.844
Miss Jennings, is it true
that Laura used to help you

39:50.054 --> 39:51.262
with the Meals on Wheels program,

39:51.472 --> 39:53.139
delivering hot dinners
to elderly shut-ins?

39:53.307 --> 39:54.891
Yeah, Laura helped organize
that program.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.561
Do you have the names of the people
on her route?

39:58.771 --> 40:01.314
- I can get them for you.
- Mm. Would you, please?

40:01.524 --> 40:04.692
And, uh, two more pieces
of this incredible pie.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.196
Okay.

40:08.781 --> 40:13.618
Man, oh, man, you must have
the metabolism of a bumblebee.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.123
For your information,

40:18.332 --> 40:21.126
I heard you speaking
about Laura Palmer.

40:21.335 --> 40:22.919
Yes.

40:23.129 --> 40:27.757
One day, my log will have
something to say about this.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.677
My log saw something that night.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.930
Really? What did it see?

40:35.224 --> 40:37.016
Ask it.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.440
I thought so.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.244
Thanks, Norma. See you tomorrow.

41:09.383 --> 41:10.508
Hi, Leo.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.386
Brought you some pie.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.059
Where's my shirt?

41:21.187 --> 41:22.729
What shirt?

41:24.231 --> 41:25.523
My favorite blue shirt.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.862
It's the second one
you lost this year.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.490
I'm gonna teach you a lesson now,
Shelly,

41:33.699 --> 41:35.033
about taking care of my property.

41:35.242 --> 41:37.327
That means making sure
things aren't lost or damaged.

41:37.536 --> 41:38.870
Oh, God, please, Leo.

41:39.038 --> 41:40.413
- This is gonna hurt you.
- No.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.374
No!

41:52.134 --> 41:53.843
I'll get it.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.142
Come on.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.815
Uh, Mom, Dad, this is James.
James Hurley.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.485
- How do you do, James?
- Nice to see you, sir, Mrs. Hayward.

42:10.694 --> 42:13.154
Very nice to meet you, James.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.115
Well, I hope you're hungry.

42:16.325 --> 42:20.161
- Eileen's been cooking up a storm.
- Yes, sir.

42:20.746 --> 42:22.205
Would you like something to drink?

42:22.414 --> 42:25.083
We have some soft drinks
and some fruit punch,

42:25.292 --> 42:26.543
some sparkling cider.

42:26.710 --> 42:29.546
Uh, fruit punch.
That'd be good, thank you.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.881
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.133
Uh, why don't you fellas
sit down at the table

42:34.343 --> 42:36.970
and I'll go check on the roast.

42:50.276 --> 42:53.111
- Here's your fruit punch.
- Thanks, Donna.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.822
I don't believe
I know your parents, James.

42:56.031 --> 43:00.326
No, sir. My dad died when I was 10
and my mom travels a lot.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.912
- She writes for the paper sometimes.
- Oh.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.207
Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm
is James' uncle.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.502
His, uh,
wife's the lady with the patch.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.797
Yes, sir, that's my Aunt Nadine.
She's a real character.

43:14.550 --> 43:17.302
Will? Could you come
give me a hand, please?

43:17.469 --> 43:20.388
Uh, excuse me.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.185
We can talk after dinner.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.271
It's good to see you.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.565
It's good to see you too.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.668
That bastard.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.713
First your girlfriend, then mine.

43:56.175 --> 43:59.302
Too bad we can only kill him once.

44:05.392 --> 44:07.226
Hey, what's up, doc?

44:07.436 --> 44:09.896
It's Laura Palmer
in case you haven't guessed.

44:10.105 --> 44:12.899
I'm making you
another one of these tapes,

44:13.108 --> 44:14.942
which, as you already know,

44:15.152 --> 44:19.280
I've mailed to you
in one of the envelopes you gave me.

44:19.740 --> 44:24.619
It's Thursday the 23rd
and I'm so bored.

44:24.828 --> 44:28.081
Actually,
I'm in kind of a weird mood.

44:31.293 --> 44:37.632
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

44:38.008 --> 44:41.302
I should have met you
a long time ago, Dr. Jacoby,

44:41.512 --> 44:46.140
because right now,
I can take just so much of sweet.

44:46.350 --> 44:50.603
I just know I'm gonna get lost
in those woods again tonight.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.980
I just know it.

44:53.190 --> 44:57.735
Remember me telling you
about that mystery man?

44:57.945 --> 44:59.654
Well...
