00:01.568 --> 00:02.569
WILSON:
Previously on "The Practice"

00:02.602 --> 00:03.637
Has anybody seen Tara?

00:03.670 --> 00:04.337
She's with a client.

00:04.370 --> 00:05.138
She'll be out all day.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.773
I need a typist today, Alan.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.442
I'm sure Jimmy can type.
What'd you say?

00:09.475 --> 00:11.912
YOUNG: Tara works for the firm,
Alan, not just you.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.549
Forgive me, but since
I just brought in $750,000

00:15.582 --> 00:17.150
on top of the $2 million
before that,

00:17.183 --> 00:19.385
on top of the $3 million
before that.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.555
The guy is monopolizing
associates

00:21.588 --> 00:23.223
like he's a partner,
which he isn't.

00:23.256 --> 00:24.457
I'm sick of this.

00:24.490 --> 00:25.792
And I'm also sick of you

00:25.826 --> 00:27.594
making excuses for the guy.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.329
You bugged a hotel room

00:29.362 --> 00:30.831
to get illicit private pictures.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.766
You then used those pictures

00:32.799 --> 00:33.800
to commit extortion.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.436
You have stepped way
outside the law.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.572
I gave you my word

00:38.605 --> 00:40.406
that I'd sooner take myself down

00:40.440 --> 00:41.875
than this firm,
I meant that.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.309
YOUNG: Well, you're taking
yourself down

00:43.343 --> 00:45.478
and you're taking us
down with you.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.447
You're a very interesting woman,
aren't you?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.683
If you'd like to go
to a nice restaurant,

00:49.716 --> 00:51.351
share a lovely bottle of wine,

00:51.384 --> 00:53.119
but you don't want that.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.888
You want to do it
on a conference table,

00:54.921 --> 00:56.456
because it's debased.

00:56.489 --> 00:57.824
Get some help,

00:57.858 --> 00:59.359
and then ask me out
to dinner some time.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.502
I don't get it, Ellenor.

01:01.535 --> 01:03.970
I see nothing redeeming
about that man.

01:04.004 --> 01:05.606
You have to know him, Jimmy.

01:05.639 --> 01:08.141
Listen to me, Alan.
I'm tired of listening to you.

01:08.174 --> 01:09.375
You're not that interesting.

01:09.408 --> 01:10.443
I'll keep completely
out of your way.

01:10.476 --> 01:11.645
You stay the hell
out of mine.

01:13.914 --> 01:15.882
He's gone.
Eugene.

01:15.916 --> 01:17.383
YOUNG:
When this trial is over,

01:17.417 --> 01:18.785
that man is gone.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.862
WOMAN: Analyzing therapy.
MARY: (moaning) Oh.

01:28.895 --> 01:30.063
Oh, God, help me!

01:30.096 --> 01:31.965
Just hang in there.
Oh, it hurts!

01:31.998 --> 01:32.899
You're doing great, honey.

01:32.933 --> 01:34.000
You're doing great, baby.
It hurts.

01:34.034 --> 01:35.068
It hurts.
TOM: You're doing great.

01:35.101 --> 01:37.103
Where's the doctor?
He's in with another patient.

01:37.137 --> 01:38.104
He'll be right here--
MARY: Please get him!

01:38.138 --> 01:39.339
How're we doing?
MARY: Oh, God.

01:39.372 --> 01:40.807
WOMAN: Still dilated
to six centimeters.

01:40.841 --> 01:41.842
Fetal heart rate?

01:41.875 --> 01:43.009
WOMAN: Stable in the 140s.

01:43.043 --> 01:44.545
MARY: Please do something!
ROBERT: Mary--

01:44.578 --> 01:45.779
let's retest for proteins.

01:45.812 --> 01:47.480
Mary, you've only
been here an hour.

01:47.514 --> 01:49.049
It takes time.
It hurts.

01:49.082 --> 01:50.183
ROBERT: Well, I can start you
on epidural,

01:50.216 --> 01:51.284
but I think it's
a little late for that.

01:51.317 --> 01:52.285
Wait. The fetal heart
rate's dropped.

01:52.318 --> 01:53.687
(Mary screams)
TOM: Oh, my God!

01:53.720 --> 01:55.488
WOMAN: Looks like an abruption!
ROBERT: Get her on her side!

01:55.522 --> 01:56.757
We need two (indistinct) now!
TOM: Mary!

01:56.790 --> 01:58.324
WOMAN: She's crashing--
Get her to the OR, now!

01:58.358 --> 01:59.960
Mary? Mary, I need you--
WOMAN: Okay. We're disconnected.

01:59.993 --> 02:01.401
ROBERT: to stay with me.
Stay with me now.

02:01.434 --> 02:03.203
Are we ready? Let's move.
WOMAN: That's it. Let's roll!

02:03.236 --> 02:04.538
ROBERT: Mary, I need you
to stay with me.

02:04.571 --> 02:06.640
WOMAN: A little (indistinct)--
Stay with me, Mary.

02:06.673 --> 02:07.340
Stay with me now.

02:07.841 --> 02:09.142
Stay with me.

02:09.175 --> 02:11.211
WOMAN: Come on, honey.
Come on, Mary, hang in there.

02:11.244 --> 02:12.212
Go, go.

02:12.245 --> 02:13.547
Let's go.
Move! Move!

02:14.380 --> 02:16.049
TOM: "Stay with me."

02:16.082 --> 02:17.150
That's what he said.

02:18.217 --> 02:19.218
The nurse pushed me
out of the room,

02:19.252 --> 02:21.387
so I waited in the hallway.

02:21.421 --> 02:22.623
Praying.

02:22.656 --> 02:24.525
Can you tell us
what happened next?

02:25.158 --> 02:26.860
The doctor finally came out.

02:27.427 --> 02:28.695
He said my daughter was okay,

02:28.729 --> 02:31.064
but Mary didn't make it.

02:32.799 --> 02:34.434
She died
on the operating table.

02:36.269 --> 02:37.771
STRINGER:
Tom, when you first arrived

02:37.804 --> 02:38.905
at the hospital--

02:38.939 --> 02:40.907
TOM: She was in severe pain.

02:40.941 --> 02:42.543
We told them.

02:43.610 --> 02:45.378
They just put us in a room.

02:45.411 --> 02:47.080
They didn't do any tests?

02:47.113 --> 02:48.815
TOM: Yes. Some.

02:48.849 --> 02:50.684
But they just said
it's labor pains,

02:50.717 --> 02:52.686
which Mary knew was wrong.

02:52.719 --> 02:54.020
She kept telling them.

02:55.556 --> 02:57.323
They just dismissed it.

02:57.991 --> 02:59.159
SEABURY: Did your wife
see a doctor

02:59.192 --> 03:01.067
during her pregnancy
or receive any kind

03:01.101 --> 03:02.636
of prenatal examination?

03:02.669 --> 03:03.904
TOM: we couldn't afford it.

03:03.937 --> 03:05.572
I was an unemployed musician
at the time and I--

03:05.606 --> 03:08.108
SEABURY:
Did you have health insurance?

03:08.141 --> 03:08.842
No.

03:08.875 --> 03:09.943
SEABURY: So she never knew

03:09.976 --> 03:11.812
that she had an abnormal uterus?

03:12.412 --> 03:13.213
No.

03:13.246 --> 03:14.781
And when you arrived
at the hospital,

03:14.815 --> 03:17.150
you told them that your wife
was in labor?

03:17.618 --> 03:18.519
Yes.

03:18.552 --> 03:19.520
SEABURY: And you didn't suspect

03:19.553 --> 03:20.587
that anything was wrong?

03:20.621 --> 03:23.657
At the time, I thought
it was just a painful labor.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.626
Clearly, it was not just that.

03:25.659 --> 03:27.027
SEABURY: I understand.
Thank you.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.028
I'm all done.

03:28.061 --> 03:31.932
Except to say
that we're all so,

03:31.965 --> 03:33.499
so sorry about what happened.

03:36.603 --> 03:37.538
May I respond to that?

03:38.972 --> 03:41.875
(scoffs) The--there's
no question before you, sir.

03:41.908 --> 03:43.109
TOM: I'd like to respond

03:43.143 --> 03:44.978
to his statement
that he's sorry.

03:45.011 --> 03:46.780
I sat through four depositions

03:46.813 --> 03:48.348
and never once
did this attorney

03:48.381 --> 03:50.316
show any remorse,
contrition--

03:50.350 --> 03:51.885
Move to strike.
TOM: --but in front of the jury,

03:51.918 --> 03:53.720
he's suddenly compassionate.

03:53.754 --> 03:55.055
ZELDIN: Okay, Mr. Quillen.

03:55.088 --> 03:56.022
You've made your point.

03:56.557 --> 03:57.724
You're angry at me.

03:58.959 --> 04:00.133
Yes, I am.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.868
SEABURY: I'm informed
that after your wife died,

04:01.902 --> 04:03.236
you stopped going to church.

04:03.269 --> 04:04.805
According to several
of your friends,

04:04.838 --> 04:07.140
you're angry at God,
is that fair?

04:07.774 --> 04:09.610
Maybe.
SEABURY: So you're angry

04:09.643 --> 04:10.944
at the doctor,
you're angry at me,

04:10.977 --> 04:12.546
even angry at God.

04:12.579 --> 04:13.714
Given that you never
got your wife

04:13.747 --> 04:15.315
any prenatal care whatsoever,

04:15.348 --> 04:17.851
when a simple checkup perhaps
could have saved her life,

04:17.884 --> 04:20.954
are you at all angry
with yourself?

04:24.324 --> 04:29.229
(music playing)

05:10.010 --> 05:11.678
This feels uncomfortable.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.579
LAWYER: Eugene,

05:12.613 --> 05:14.815
if you're about
to fire somebody,

05:14.848 --> 05:16.550
you have to meet
with a labor lawyer.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.984
It would be corporate negligence

05:18.018 --> 05:19.152
for you not to do so.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.754
Yeah.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.322
Even so.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.058
LAWYER: Is this an
administrative employee, or--

05:25.091 --> 05:26.459
YOUNG: No. He's an associate,

05:26.492 --> 05:28.461
who acts like a partner,

05:28.494 --> 05:29.896
which is part of the problem.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.165
What are the grounds?

05:32.198 --> 05:33.499
Well, where do I start?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.435
Um, he's unethical,

05:35.969 --> 05:36.937
insubordinate,

05:36.970 --> 05:38.304
he sexually harasses,

05:38.338 --> 05:40.406
he's even committed
criminal acts.

05:41.107 --> 05:44.110
Problem is
he's also brought in

05:44.144 --> 05:45.178
a lot of money,

05:45.211 --> 05:46.479
so he may try to claim

05:46.513 --> 05:48.114
that he's a de facto partner.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.684
When you say a lot of money?

05:51.451 --> 05:52.586
For the last six months,

05:52.619 --> 05:57.357
more than all the other
lawyers combined.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.267
You may have a problem.

06:07.207 --> 06:10.210
KOBATCH:
During the course of labor,
her uterus ruptured,

06:10.243 --> 06:12.145
which ultimately
was the cause of death.

06:12.178 --> 06:13.379
She bled to death.

06:13.714 --> 06:14.681
Yes.

06:14.715 --> 06:16.349
FRUTT:
In your opinion, doctor,

06:16.382 --> 06:19.352
could Dr. Platt have prevented
Mary Quillen's death?

06:19.385 --> 06:21.187
Could have and should have.

06:21.221 --> 06:22.956
She was in severe pain,

06:22.989 --> 06:24.525
she wasn't dilating,

06:24.558 --> 06:26.560
a c-section was indicated,

06:26.593 --> 06:28.361
and he failed to perform one.

06:28.394 --> 06:31.297
This death
was easily preventable.

06:31.331 --> 06:33.534
SEABURY: The autopsy
showed that Mrs. Quillen

06:33.567 --> 06:35.636
had an abnormally small uterus,

06:35.669 --> 06:37.137
which might have
caused it to rupture.

06:37.170 --> 06:38.739
Correct.
SEABURY: But Dr. Platt

06:38.772 --> 06:40.841
had no way
of knowing this, did he?

06:40.874 --> 06:43.744
Mrs. Quillen never
had a prenatal exam.

06:43.777 --> 06:46.179
Many women
don't have prenatal exams.

06:46.212 --> 06:48.949
Doctors still managed
to give them adequate care.

06:48.982 --> 06:50.584
Your client didn't.
I see.

06:50.617 --> 06:52.886
Were you in the delivery room
that night, doctor?

06:52.919 --> 06:54.621
KOBATCH:
No, but your client admits

06:54.655 --> 06:56.823
the patient was in labor
for an hour,

06:56.857 --> 06:57.891
he saw her suffering,

06:57.924 --> 06:59.693
severe upper abdominal pain,

06:59.726 --> 07:02.202
he knew her contractions
had stopped.

07:02.235 --> 07:04.204
He had more than enough
information

07:04.237 --> 07:06.039
to do an immediate c-section.

07:06.072 --> 07:07.574
And failing to do so--
SEABURY: Have you been paid

07:07.608 --> 07:09.910
by the plaintiff
to give your opinion today?

07:11.144 --> 07:13.780
My opinion
is not for sale, counsel.

07:13.814 --> 07:16.082
It's based on the facts
presented to me.

07:16.116 --> 07:17.483
SEABURY: But a lot of those
facts were not available

07:17.518 --> 07:19.252
to my client
that night in the ER,

07:19.285 --> 07:20.320
were they, doctor?
Perhaps not.

07:20.353 --> 07:21.421
Even so--
SEABURY: Thank you.

07:21.454 --> 07:23.323
And though your opinions
aren't for sale,

07:23.356 --> 07:25.125
how much are you being paid

07:25.158 --> 07:26.192
for today's court appearance?

07:26.993 --> 07:28.394
$3,000.

07:28.428 --> 07:30.263
SEABURY: And how many times
have you testified

07:30.296 --> 07:32.065
in medical malpractice?
FRUTT: Objection!

07:32.098 --> 07:33.433
This is irrelevant.

07:37.003 --> 07:38.104
Your Honor?

07:38.138 --> 07:41.074
(music playing)

07:48.414 --> 07:49.349
MAN: Grab the door.

07:52.185 --> 07:56.056
(indistinct chatter)

07:56.089 --> 07:57.323
Now what?

07:57.991 --> 07:59.392
I don't know.

07:59.425 --> 08:01.802
If he's okay,
it could just be a delay.

08:01.835 --> 08:04.104
If he's not,
we could get a mistrial.

08:04.638 --> 08:06.406
Which means?

08:06.439 --> 08:08.842
We might have to start
all over again.

08:12.813 --> 08:16.316
(sighs) The earliest I could
possibly get out is 7:00.

08:16.349 --> 08:19.119
And then probably close--
Where are you going at 7:00?

08:19.953 --> 08:20.954
One second.

08:20.987 --> 08:21.788
Should I come?

08:21.822 --> 08:22.989
(whispers) This is personal.

08:23.023 --> 08:24.090
Man trouble?

08:24.124 --> 08:25.458
Do you mind?
SHORE: Tara,

08:25.491 --> 08:28.228
if it is a man,
I could be of tremendous help.

08:28.261 --> 08:30.496
In a prior life,
I was Cyrano de Bergerac.

08:30.531 --> 08:32.298
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.299
To whom am I talking?

08:34.900 --> 08:36.102
This is Tara's uncle

08:36.135 --> 08:37.571
from the more disturbing branch
of the family.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.005
Stop it!
Have you two been kissing?

08:39.039 --> 08:39.905
Alan!

08:43.308 --> 08:45.045
Go to the corner and sit.

08:45.445 --> 08:46.647
I'm just trying to help.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.189
The advice is,
"Don't tell Ellenor".

08:56.222 --> 08:58.559
BERLUTI: She's a partner.
YOUNG: She's also his friend,

08:58.592 --> 08:59.960
and she'll tell him.

08:59.993 --> 09:02.402
Now, if he takes clients
or files, then what?

09:04.137 --> 09:05.972
(sighs)

09:06.006 --> 09:08.842
So how does this go down?

09:08.875 --> 09:10.611
YOUNG: Well, as we fire him,

09:10.644 --> 09:12.112
we send out prewritten letters

09:12.145 --> 09:14.114
by registered mail
to all our clients,

09:14.147 --> 09:15.315
explaining the split,

09:15.348 --> 09:16.817
inviting them to stay with us.

09:16.850 --> 09:19.886
We also have a locksmith
on standby to change the locks,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.255
we change the passwords
on the computers,

09:22.288 --> 09:24.691
all of this has to happen
as we fire him,

09:24.725 --> 09:27.293
not a minute before,
because if we jump the gun,

09:27.327 --> 09:28.862
he can paint it as bad faith.

09:28.895 --> 09:31.264
As opposed to being
on the up-and-up.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.034
It's a dirty business, Jimmy.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.736
But according to labor counsel,

09:35.769 --> 09:37.638
it's the only way we can do it.

09:41.107 --> 09:42.509
I need two votes.

09:43.944 --> 09:45.278
You with me?

09:54.487 --> 09:55.455
(door opens)

09:59.192 --> 10:01.602
Well, good news
is Judge Zeldin is okay.

10:01.635 --> 10:02.936
The bad news is...

10:02.969 --> 10:04.605
doctors have prescribed
bed rest,

10:04.638 --> 10:05.806
and he can't continue.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.408
So...
I'll take over.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.076
His clerk has brought me
up to speed.

10:12.513 --> 10:14.180
Do you think that's wise?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.248
MANTLE: Why isn't it?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.950
You've expended
two court days already,

10:16.983 --> 10:19.586
it certainly make sense
to keep going if possible.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.087
Nobody's been prejudiced.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.258
FRUTT:
We have a little problem.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.493
(door closes)

10:28.995 --> 10:30.230
You remember we told you

10:30.263 --> 10:32.833
about the Massachusetts
Charitable Immunity Act,

10:32.866 --> 10:35.669
limiting damages
in medical malpractice cases?

10:35.702 --> 10:38.171
You said judges
sometimes strike it.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.306
FRUTT: I did.
And Judge Zeldin

10:40.340 --> 10:41.842
was one such judge.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.109
Judge Mantle is not.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.878
He seems to honor the cap.

10:45.546 --> 10:46.279
So...

10:47.814 --> 10:50.884
The most money we could get here

10:50.917 --> 10:52.953
is now $20,000.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.222
What I think we should do

10:56.256 --> 10:57.958
is try to settle it for that.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.893
No.
Tom--

10:59.926 --> 11:03.369
TOM: I will not settle
my wife's life for $20,000.

11:03.403 --> 11:05.271
I'd rather take
the moral victory

11:05.305 --> 11:06.306
of a big verdict

11:06.339 --> 11:09.042
than walk away for--

11:09.075 --> 11:10.476
FRUTT: Tom,

11:10.511 --> 11:12.513
I cannot in good
conscience expend

11:12.546 --> 11:14.548
thousands of dollars
on expert witnesses,

11:14.581 --> 11:16.149
and expend our time--

11:16.182 --> 11:18.819
I didn't get a doctor
because I'm poor.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.554
Now you're saying
I don't get a lawyer.

11:20.587 --> 11:21.622
FRUTT: That's not fair.

11:21.655 --> 11:24.891
We have put in hundreds
of hours on this case.

11:24.925 --> 11:25.926
TOM: Then why quit now,

11:25.959 --> 11:27.127
in the middle of trial?

11:27.160 --> 11:28.562
FRUTT: Because as I said,

11:28.595 --> 11:31.698
this judge--
TOM: I want a verdict.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.467
I want the jury sending
these people a message.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.937
FRUTT: "These people"
in this case

11:36.970 --> 11:38.772
is an insurance company.

11:38.805 --> 11:40.541
The only message
they're equipped

11:40.574 --> 11:41.742
to receive is numerical,

11:41.775 --> 11:44.511
and they are immune on this.

11:47.981 --> 11:50.283
If you want us
to keep going,

11:50.316 --> 11:51.317
we will.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.825
Why?
STRINGER: Because he hired us,

11:58.859 --> 12:00.300
Eugene, to--
To win a judgment

12:00.333 --> 12:01.635
that now you cannot get.

12:01.668 --> 12:04.104
This judge is fair, and--
YOUNG: Look, she's a partner

12:04.137 --> 12:06.472
billing out at $400 an hour.
You bill out at $250.

12:06.507 --> 12:07.541
This case could take a week.

12:07.574 --> 12:09.275
SHORE: Pay no attention
to him, Jamie.

12:09.309 --> 12:10.310
Good for you.

12:12.746 --> 12:15.849
I feel the mean man
glaring at me.

12:15.882 --> 12:17.784
This doesn't concern you.

12:17.818 --> 12:20.186
SHORE:
Oh, but it does, Eugene.
I can tell her how to win.

12:20.554 --> 12:21.555
How?

12:21.588 --> 12:22.656
SHORE: I know Judge Mantle.

12:22.689 --> 12:24.558
He's a man given
to compassion.

12:24.591 --> 12:25.892
And better yet, politics.

12:25.926 --> 12:27.393
If you shock his conscience,

12:27.427 --> 12:28.829
get some media down there

12:28.862 --> 12:30.564
to shed some light
on that conscience,

12:30.597 --> 12:32.533
out of the goodness
of both heart and career,

12:32.566 --> 12:33.867
he'll probably do
the right thing.

12:34.901 --> 12:36.136
I have a reporter

12:36.770 --> 12:38.772
from WXDE.

12:40.006 --> 12:41.374
She owes me a favor.

12:41.407 --> 12:43.777
It's biblical, but I'm sure
she'd be thrilled

12:43.810 --> 12:46.046
to compromise herself
professionally instead.

12:46.079 --> 12:47.881
Go! Tell your story, Jamie.

12:47.914 --> 12:49.082
The cap is wrong.

12:49.115 --> 12:51.184
The woman died having a baby,
for God's sake.

12:51.217 --> 12:52.586
The man deserves
more than $20,000.

12:52.619 --> 12:53.554
Be an advocate.

12:53.587 --> 12:54.855
Fix the problem.

12:54.888 --> 12:56.322
Go, team, go. Rah!

13:00.026 --> 13:01.502
Tara, Jimmy,

13:01.535 --> 13:02.769
in my office, please.

13:04.938 --> 13:07.173
I feel like coffee
and a croissant, shall we?

13:14.981 --> 13:15.949
(door closes)

13:20.854 --> 13:22.022
(Eugene clears throat)

13:23.990 --> 13:25.559
This is confidential
information.

13:25.592 --> 13:27.260
It is a partner matter.

13:27.293 --> 13:29.229
You are not to share
this information

13:29.262 --> 13:32.032
with anybody
other than Jimmy and me.

13:32.065 --> 13:32.899
Clear?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.201
Okay.

13:35.235 --> 13:37.337
We need to have all
the computer passwords

13:37.370 --> 13:39.172
changed by Thursday noon.

13:39.205 --> 13:42.175
The new password,
which I will give you,

13:42.208 --> 13:43.844
you will not divulge to anyone.

13:45.078 --> 13:46.146
Okay.

13:46.179 --> 13:47.413
YOUNG: You will also get
a letter prepared

13:47.447 --> 13:48.649
by labor counsel,

13:48.682 --> 13:50.784
which letter you are to type
on our stationary,

13:50.817 --> 13:52.719
and prepare to send
by registered mail

13:52.753 --> 13:53.854
to all our clients.

13:53.887 --> 13:56.990
This, too,
by Thursday noon.

13:58.625 --> 13:59.560
Okay.

14:02.503 --> 14:04.170
This is extremely
confidential.

14:05.772 --> 14:08.609
I will trust you
to respect that confidence.

14:10.744 --> 14:11.411
Okay.

14:14.648 --> 14:15.616
That's all.

14:17.017 --> 14:17.884
(door opens)

14:24.457 --> 14:27.761
(sarcastically) Gee, I hope
she doesn't suspect anything.

14:27.794 --> 14:29.429
Well, we can't do it
without her.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.502
MILLER:
We are a charity hospital.

14:35.536 --> 14:37.571
Of course money's a problem.

14:37.604 --> 14:40.306
But it never affects
the quality of our care.

14:40.340 --> 14:41.908
STRINGER:
C-sections are about twice

14:41.942 --> 14:43.944
as expensive
as natural childbirth.

14:43.977 --> 14:44.845
Is that accurate?

14:44.878 --> 14:45.946
Yes, but--

14:45.979 --> 14:47.614
STRINGER: And who pays
the additional costs?

14:47.648 --> 14:49.516
Typically,
the insurance company.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.151
STRINGER: If the patient
has insurance.

14:51.184 --> 14:51.985
What if she doesn't?

14:52.018 --> 14:54.154
Then the hospital would pay.

14:54.187 --> 14:56.623
But that's not why
we encourage natural birth.

14:56.657 --> 14:59.492
It's safer,
the recovery time is shorter,

14:59.893 --> 15:01.502
and frankly,
too many doctors

15:01.535 --> 15:03.504
perform unnecessary c-sections.

15:03.537 --> 15:06.439
But at Saint Theresa's,
women without health insurance

15:06.472 --> 15:09.075
are five times less likely
to have a c-section

15:09.109 --> 15:11.011
than women with insurance, so--

15:11.044 --> 15:13.313
That's true
of most charity hospitals.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.181
STRINGER: That's your excuse?
They all do it?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.850
MILLER:
We are not forcing poor women

15:16.883 --> 15:18.351
to have dangerous births.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.453
And I take offense with you--
STRINGER: How many women able

15:20.486 --> 15:21.922
to pay for a c-section

15:21.955 --> 15:23.489
have ever been refused one?

15:23.524 --> 15:25.659
I'm not certain.
STRINGER: None!

15:25.692 --> 15:28.194
The only women refused
are impoverished.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.030
Poverty has nothing
to do with this.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.565
Poverty is what killed Mary.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.533
That's a lie!
SEABURY: Objection.

15:32.566 --> 15:34.367
Argumentative.
MANTLE: Sustained.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.036
STRINGER:
True or false, doctor,

15:36.069 --> 15:38.071
if Mary Quillen
had the money to pay

15:38.104 --> 15:39.039
for a c-section,

15:39.072 --> 15:40.541
she would still be alive today.

15:40.574 --> 15:41.508
False.

15:41.542 --> 15:43.443
That is false!

15:45.812 --> 15:48.448
SEABURY: Most women want
to give birth naturally,

15:48.481 --> 15:50.751
do they not?
Absolutely.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.386
In fact, the movement
to encourage natural childbirth

15:53.419 --> 15:55.556
is very much
a feminist issue.

15:55.589 --> 15:57.891
SEABURY: Has Saint Theresa's
policy of reducing c-sections

15:57.924 --> 16:00.060
been reviewed
by the State Medical Board?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.802
MILLER: Yes, our policy
has been approved

16:01.835 --> 16:03.469
as safe and appropriate.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.738
Has your hospital

16:04.771 --> 16:06.540
or Dr. Platt ever been
disciplined

16:06.573 --> 16:07.941
by the State Medical Board

16:07.974 --> 16:10.043
for what happened here?
No.

16:10.076 --> 16:13.013
Because as terrible
as this outcome was,

16:13.046 --> 16:15.415
we did nothing wrong.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.655
Did nothing wrong?

16:21.688 --> 16:25.025
How many affluent women
die delivering babies?

16:25.058 --> 16:26.593
Even the ones that do,

16:26.627 --> 16:28.795
at least the hospital tries
to save them.

16:28.829 --> 16:30.496
But, you know,

16:30.531 --> 16:31.665
that's not really the point.

16:31.698 --> 16:32.833
What is?

16:32.866 --> 16:35.368
Doctors and hospitals
make mistakes.

16:35.401 --> 16:38.238
Mistakes happen.

16:38.271 --> 16:41.307
But to shield them
from liability,

16:41.341 --> 16:43.409
I am all for tort reform.

16:43.944 --> 16:45.879
But to put a $20,000 cap

16:45.912 --> 16:48.682
on a wrongful death
is just wrong.

16:48.715 --> 16:51.017
I mean, most states
wouldn't even consider this,

16:51.051 --> 16:53.153
and Massachusetts
shouldn't either.

16:53.186 --> 16:56.256
John Kerry can't possibly
support this.

16:56.289 --> 16:58.825
Ted Kennedy,
I know doesn't.

16:58.859 --> 17:00.867
I am hopeful that Judge Mantle

17:00.901 --> 17:02.769
will reject this as well.

17:05.271 --> 17:07.040
SEABURY: That was a cheap shot,
Ms. Stringer.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.174
I would think
you'd have the integrity

17:08.208 --> 17:10.042
to at least try this case
in a courtroom.

17:10.076 --> 17:11.978
Is that why you asked
for this meeting?

17:12.012 --> 17:13.646
To lecture me?
SEABURY: You'll be lucky

17:13.680 --> 17:15.048
if you don't get censured
by the bar,

17:15.080 --> 17:16.817
but that's not why
I called for the meeting.

17:23.890 --> 17:25.258
Against my advice,

17:25.290 --> 17:26.792
the client is prepared
to offer you

17:26.827 --> 17:28.662
a hundred thousand dollars,
sealed.

17:28.695 --> 17:29.696
No admission.

17:34.635 --> 17:37.137
First of all,
a woman died.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.205
$100,000--
SEABURY: Is 80 more than

17:39.239 --> 17:40.541
you'd otherwise get
under the cap.

17:40.574 --> 17:42.475
Then why would
the hospital offer it?

17:42.509 --> 17:43.677
ROBERT: The hospital didn't.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.178
I'm making the offer.

17:46.012 --> 17:47.013
Out of your own pocket?

17:47.047 --> 17:48.314
ROBERT: Yes.
And I'll tell you why.

17:48.348 --> 17:50.183
Robert--
No, let's just deal straight.

17:50.216 --> 17:52.853
Does that violate some
attorney code of conduct?

17:53.386 --> 17:55.589
If I lose here,
cap or not,

17:55.622 --> 17:57.157
my insurance carrier
will drop me.

17:57.190 --> 17:58.859
They do it to OB-GYNs
all the time.

17:58.892 --> 18:00.466
They will do it to me.
You've said enough.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.568
ROBERT:
You represent the hospital

18:01.602 --> 18:02.969
and the insurance
company, Brian.

18:03.003 --> 18:05.271
Nobody's really speaking
for me here, I'd like to.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.109
I have never been found

18:09.142 --> 18:10.544
by any medical review board

18:10.577 --> 18:13.346
to have committed
any malpractice, ever.

18:13.379 --> 18:15.381
And yet,
I've been sued seven times.

18:15.415 --> 18:16.382
Bob--
We are getting sued

18:16.416 --> 18:17.117
out of business,

18:17.150 --> 18:18.384
and...

18:18.418 --> 18:19.620
(sighs)

18:22.589 --> 18:24.124
believe it or not,

18:24.157 --> 18:26.760
I am not in this profession
for the money.

18:26.793 --> 18:27.861
I'm a doctor,

18:27.894 --> 18:29.362
a pretty damn good one.

18:29.996 --> 18:31.632
My father was an OB-GYN.

18:31.665 --> 18:33.199
It's all I ever wanted to be.

18:35.836 --> 18:38.238
If you win in court,

18:38.271 --> 18:40.774
the most you can get is 20.

18:40.807 --> 18:42.743
I'm offering you a hundred.

18:43.409 --> 18:44.811
And I'm not taking it.

18:44.845 --> 18:46.179
FRUTT: Okay, Tom, I--
You killed my wife.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.714
ROBERT:
No, you contributed to that--

18:47.748 --> 18:50.050
(shouting indistinctly)

18:50.083 --> 18:50.917
Hey!

18:57.123 --> 18:58.659
The offer is rejected.

18:59.626 --> 19:00.426
Let's go.

19:00.460 --> 19:03.203
I'm offering you
every penny I have.

19:04.505 --> 19:06.372
And it's not enough.

19:12.278 --> 19:13.714
The offer is rejected.

19:37.538 --> 19:39.706
Working kind of late?
SHORE: Oh, no.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.042
I'm just pretending
so as to impress

19:42.075 --> 19:45.345
and inspire my office mates.

19:45.378 --> 19:48.314
(music playing)

19:57.157 --> 19:59.693
Eugene's hired a labor
law firm for something.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.570
All the computer passwords
are being changed.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.542
It looks like someone's
getting fired.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.587
I'm sure it's nothing.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.633
Tara?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.337
Thank you.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.306
(music playing)

21:02.869 --> 21:05.271
I'm all for tort reform,

21:05.305 --> 21:07.808
but to put a $20,000 cap
on a wrongful death...

21:07.841 --> 21:09.009
It's getting played.

21:09.042 --> 21:10.143
I guess that's good.

21:10.677 --> 21:11.745
You ready for the doctor?

21:11.778 --> 21:12.879
I think so.

21:12.913 --> 21:14.014
I gotta go hard, right?

21:14.047 --> 21:16.517
I would.
Clearly he has a button.

21:16.550 --> 21:18.351
If you can get him to go
"Howard Dean" up there,

21:18.384 --> 21:19.052
that could help.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.254
I just don't want to come off
as a monster.

21:23.890 --> 21:26.727
Jamie, we need to accomplish
two goals here.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.762
First, to get
a favorable verdict,

21:28.795 --> 21:31.297
which will be tough,
because...

21:31.331 --> 21:32.533
between you and me,

21:32.566 --> 21:34.668
I'm not sure this doctor
committed any negligence.

21:35.068 --> 21:37.003
And second,
even should we win,

21:37.037 --> 21:39.239
the judge has to be
outraged enough

21:39.272 --> 21:41.374
to strike the cap.

21:41.407 --> 21:42.576
Now, the book
on this judge

21:42.609 --> 21:45.378
is that he does rule
from emotion sometimes.

21:45.411 --> 21:46.880
So go for it.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.918
I've got the draft letter
pretty much done.

21:51.952 --> 21:54.555
Uh, I emailed it
to the labor lawyer,

21:54.588 --> 21:56.122
he sent it back
with some minor changes,

21:56.156 --> 21:57.624
but I want you
to review it, too.

21:57.658 --> 21:59.025
(beep)

21:59.059 --> 22:00.233
When do we tell Ellenor?

22:01.334 --> 22:02.869
She's back from the court
at lunch.

22:02.903 --> 22:04.905
We'll tell her then,
just before we tell him.

22:07.007 --> 22:09.009
Hello, Eugene!
What the--

22:09.042 --> 22:10.043
SHORE (over laptop): Listen,
I've been having trouble

22:10.076 --> 22:11.377
getting into my computer.

22:11.411 --> 22:13.113
I was wondering
if you could help.

22:13.146 --> 22:17.217
Almost seems as if
the password's been changed.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.753
But I'd know if there were
a new password,

22:19.786 --> 22:20.453
wouldn't I?

22:21.688 --> 22:24.257
<i>I mean, you wouldn't change it</i>
<i>behind my back, would you?</i>

22:24.290 --> 22:26.292
That's something
Jimmy might do,

22:26.326 --> 22:27.260
but not--

22:27.293 --> 22:28.261
oh, hello, Jimmy.

22:28.829 --> 22:31.031
I didn't see you there
at first.

22:31.064 --> 22:32.398
I'm not surprised, though,

22:32.432 --> 22:34.367
following closely as usual,

22:34.400 --> 22:35.536
waiting for orders,

22:35.569 --> 22:38.104
hoping for a few scraps.

22:38.672 --> 22:41.441
Anyway, Eugene, forgive me

22:41.474 --> 22:43.109
if I seem overly concerned,

22:43.143 --> 22:45.011
but, well, it's just

22:45.045 --> 22:48.081
people have screwed me over
in the past.

22:49.683 --> 22:52.085
And I don't like
getting screwed over.

22:54.621 --> 22:58.324
WOMAN (over TV):
You've been a bad bad cowboy.

22:58.358 --> 22:59.693
MAN (over TV): Oh--

22:59.726 --> 23:00.834
Get him in here.

23:00.867 --> 23:01.535
Eugene.

23:02.035 --> 23:04.470
Get him in here, now.

23:07.407 --> 23:09.910
I've delivered thousands
of babies over my career.

23:09.943 --> 23:12.478
I never lost a mother
until this case.

23:12.513 --> 23:14.047
You were monitoring her.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.048
Did you miss anything?

23:15.081 --> 23:16.116
ROBERT: I don't think so.

23:16.149 --> 23:18.719
Had she seen a doctor
during her pregnancy,

23:18.752 --> 23:21.287
I would have known about her
uterine abnormality,

23:21.321 --> 23:23.624
and I probably would have gone
with a c-section sooner.

23:23.657 --> 23:25.125
Probably would have?

23:25.158 --> 23:27.628
ROBERT: Natural childbirth
is always preferred

23:27.661 --> 23:28.962
for the baby and the mother.

23:28.995 --> 23:31.297
Doing c-sections
without cause

23:31.331 --> 23:32.398
is bad medicine.

23:32.432 --> 23:33.967
She wasn't in labor
that long,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.903
and we had no warning
she was in danger.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.439
Predicting uterine rupture
in a healthy woman

23:39.472 --> 23:42.475
who never gave birth before
is almost impossible.

23:42.509 --> 23:43.777
This was a tragedy,

23:43.810 --> 23:46.179
but it is not one
we could have avoided.

23:50.884 --> 23:52.352
STRINGER:
The Quillens told you

23:52.385 --> 23:54.254
they didn't have the money
for prenatal care.

23:54.287 --> 23:56.657
That had nothing to do
with the treatment I gave her.

23:56.690 --> 23:58.124
My question, doctor,

23:58.158 --> 23:59.826
did you know they couldn't pay
for treatment?

23:59.860 --> 24:01.502
Yes.
STRINGER: You also knew

24:01.535 --> 24:03.069
they didn't have insurance,
correct?

24:03.103 --> 24:05.105
ROBERT: Yes.
STRINGER: So you knew

24:05.138 --> 24:06.272
that whatever
treatment they got,

24:06.306 --> 24:07.708
the hospital was gonna
have to eat it?

24:07.741 --> 24:11.144
I did not put that woman's life
at risk to save money.

24:11.177 --> 24:12.946
She had only been
in labor an hour,

24:12.979 --> 24:14.347
it would have been
inhumane

24:14.380 --> 24:16.382
to just cut her open
without cause.

24:16.416 --> 24:18.251
Any doctor--
She was screaming in pain.

24:18.284 --> 24:19.352
She was in labor.
It's painful.

24:19.385 --> 24:20.554
STRINGER:
You weren't even there!

24:20.587 --> 24:22.422
I was there.
You weren't!

24:22.455 --> 24:23.624
How many obstetricians
were on duty

24:23.657 --> 24:24.758
that night at the hospital?

24:26.226 --> 24:28.461
Just me. The other obstetricians
had quit, because--

24:28.494 --> 24:30.130
Objection.
Sustained.

24:30.163 --> 24:33.266
You were the only OB-GYN
on duty that night.

24:33.299 --> 24:35.536
And in fact, you hadn't slept
for two nights

24:35.569 --> 24:37.571
before Mary Quillen came in.

24:37.604 --> 24:39.740
You were overseeing--
I was not overly tired.

24:39.773 --> 24:42.175
I was no busier than usual.
--exhausted and overworked--

24:42.208 --> 24:44.611
I was not!
--and you made a bad decision.

24:44.645 --> 24:45.546
I did the best I could!

24:45.579 --> 24:47.814
She came in to have a baby,
she's dead--

24:47.848 --> 24:48.982
and you did the best?

24:49.015 --> 24:49.950
I didn't do anything wrong!

24:49.983 --> 24:51.785
You didn't do anything at all!

24:51.818 --> 24:53.253
I did everything I could!

24:53.286 --> 24:55.155
But you know what, counsel,

24:55.188 --> 24:56.790
I will tell you this.
Objection.

24:56.823 --> 24:58.458
Doctor!
When that judge went face down

24:58.491 --> 24:59.993
the other day, I froze.

25:00.026 --> 25:01.067
I wanted to run up,

25:01.101 --> 25:02.569
I'm a doctor, for God's sake,

25:02.603 --> 25:04.571
but I was too afraid
of getting sued, so--

25:04.605 --> 25:06.206
Did you freeze in the
emergency room that night?

25:06.239 --> 25:07.841
No! I did not.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.576
But many doctors might.
MANTLE: Dr. Platt!

25:09.610 --> 25:10.977
You're the problem!

25:11.011 --> 25:13.780
You're the problem!
Dr. Platt, that is enough!

25:27.794 --> 25:29.129
Did I go too hard?

25:29.162 --> 25:29.930
I don't think so.

25:29.963 --> 25:30.997
You had to go after him.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.799
You had no choice.

25:32.833 --> 25:33.867
Is your closing ready?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.102
Not exactly,
but I'll work on it.

25:36.136 --> 25:37.804
May I please
speak to you?

25:37.838 --> 25:39.506
Doctor, you're represented
by counsel.

25:39.540 --> 25:40.373
I realize that,

25:40.406 --> 25:42.308
but my counsel
has a conflict.

25:42.342 --> 25:44.545
He represents the hospital
and the insurance company.

25:44.578 --> 25:46.346
Then you need to retain
another lawyer, we can't--

25:46.379 --> 25:47.714
Two hundred thousand.

25:48.549 --> 25:51.752
I would need time
to refinance my house but--

25:51.785 --> 25:54.955
I don't think our client
is gonna move for two.

25:55.455 --> 25:56.990
You people are lawyers.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.792
You know what it's like
to be held hostage

25:58.825 --> 26:00.233
by insurance carriers.

26:00.266 --> 26:02.135
If I get any
unfavorable verdict,

26:02.168 --> 26:03.269
they drop me.

26:03.303 --> 26:05.639
Without coverage,
I can't practice.

26:05.672 --> 26:08.074
Dr. Platt,
you're represented by counsel.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.044
We cannot be having
this discussion.

26:11.077 --> 26:12.178
I'm sorry.

26:23.423 --> 26:24.290
You need me?

26:24.324 --> 26:25.559
Yes.
Close the door, please.

26:29.530 --> 26:31.431
Is this something sexual?

26:31.464 --> 26:32.498
Sit.

26:35.268 --> 26:36.937
We've decided
to let you go.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.138
Ah.

26:38.171 --> 26:39.372
Go where?

26:39.405 --> 26:41.107
You're being discharged.

26:44.244 --> 26:45.579
Why?

26:45.612 --> 26:46.547
Well,

26:46.580 --> 26:49.315
let's call it
philosophical differences.

26:51.585 --> 26:53.754
I'd like you
to leave immediately.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.723
Is Ellenor in on this?

26:56.757 --> 26:59.225
Ellenor doesn't know yet,
but she'll be informed.

26:59.726 --> 27:02.135
I suppose you've already
managed to copy files.

27:02.168 --> 27:04.337
I'll remind you that
that's illegal, though,

27:04.370 --> 27:05.872
I doubt you care.

27:05.906 --> 27:08.709
Eugene, I don't need
to copy files.

27:08.742 --> 27:11.244
And most of the corporate
clients here are mine anyway.

27:11.277 --> 27:13.680
You brought them in,
but once you did so,

27:13.714 --> 27:15.749
they became clients
of the firm.

27:17.017 --> 27:18.118
Here's a check

27:18.151 --> 27:20.587
representing two weeks'
severance pay.

27:20.621 --> 27:21.588
Hmm.

27:26.326 --> 27:27.561
I've generated fees

27:27.594 --> 27:29.229
an excess of $6 million,

27:29.262 --> 27:31.464
you've handed me
a check for $15,000.

27:31.497 --> 27:32.332
You can keep it.

27:36.837 --> 27:39.139
You're a very talented
lawyer, Alan,

27:39.172 --> 27:41.374
but you don't fit in here.

27:41.407 --> 27:43.777
We'll be happy to give you
a good recommendation.

27:45.712 --> 27:48.348
Now, it's time
for you to go.

27:49.983 --> 27:51.217
Eugene,

27:51.251 --> 27:52.252
is it sexual?

27:53.820 --> 27:54.855
Goodbye, Alan.

27:55.622 --> 27:57.023
I'm keeping checkers.

28:01.735 --> 28:02.468
Tara.

28:12.546 --> 28:13.580
(door closes)

28:15.982 --> 28:19.085
Alan Shore seemed to know
this was coming.

28:19.119 --> 28:20.253
Did you tell him?

28:22.856 --> 28:23.524
Yes.

28:25.626 --> 28:26.727
I'm sorry.

28:27.861 --> 28:29.129
I owe you a lot, Eugene,

28:29.162 --> 28:31.565
and it wasn't my intent
to betray you.

28:31.598 --> 28:34.234
Really? Well, you did.

28:34.267 --> 28:35.368
Why?

28:38.238 --> 28:39.773
I guess I like him.

28:41.307 --> 28:43.076
You told me
he repelled you.

28:45.111 --> 28:46.580
He so often does.

28:49.783 --> 28:52.485
But it turns out that
I consider him a friend.

28:54.921 --> 28:56.723
Your employment here
is terminated.

28:57.624 --> 28:59.025
You'll be given
two weeks' severance.

28:59.059 --> 29:02.068
Your discharge
is effective immediately.

29:02.102 --> 29:05.038
(music playing)

29:26.059 --> 29:26.860
FRUTT: Lucy?

29:26.893 --> 29:29.029
Hey!
Hey, Ellenor.

29:29.062 --> 29:30.030
How are you?

29:30.063 --> 29:32.265
Oh, I'm good.
Good.

29:32.298 --> 29:34.400
You look amazing.

29:34.434 --> 29:36.202
Thank you.
How have you been?

29:36.236 --> 29:38.572
How's life
as a rape counselor?

29:38.605 --> 29:40.941
Well, it's not
a lot of laughs, but--

29:40.974 --> 29:43.476
God! You look wonderful.

29:43.810 --> 29:45.311
What brings you by?

29:45.345 --> 29:46.379
You're just saying hello?

29:46.412 --> 29:48.214
Uh, nope. I'm just

29:48.248 --> 29:49.482
filling in in a pinch.

29:50.183 --> 29:51.351
Filling in?

29:53.086 --> 29:54.120
Where's Tara?

29:55.088 --> 29:55.756
Ellenor,

29:56.557 --> 29:58.158
can we talk to you
for a second?

30:00.093 --> 30:01.167
Sure.

30:12.345 --> 30:14.681
Forty minutes ago,
we fired Alan.

30:15.949 --> 30:16.917
I'm sorry?

30:16.950 --> 30:19.219
Jimmy and I agreed
that on balance,

30:19.252 --> 30:20.253
he was a detriment
to the firm so--

30:20.286 --> 30:22.322
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You and Jimmy agreed?

30:22.355 --> 30:24.424
Why wasn't I--
Because you're his friend.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.392
As well as a partner,
with a voting--

30:26.426 --> 30:28.261
We were trying to insulate you
from a conflict.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.996
That's crap!

30:30.030 --> 30:30.964
Why wasn't I told?

30:30.997 --> 30:32.699
YOUNG: Because we feared
you'd tell him,

30:32.733 --> 30:34.935
and he'd steal clients,
or files, or both.

30:34.968 --> 30:36.703
Well, it turns out Tara
tipped him off,

30:36.737 --> 30:38.404
so she was fired, as well.

30:38.438 --> 30:41.508
How dare you make a unilateral
decision without me?

30:41.542 --> 30:43.243
It wasn't unilateral.
Jimmy and I--

30:43.276 --> 30:45.478
FRUTT: I am a partner
in this firm.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.047
For you to go
behind my back--

30:47.080 --> 30:49.950
You're his friend.
I'm your friend!

30:49.983 --> 30:52.586
You have a duty
of honesty to me!

30:52.619 --> 30:53.787
As do you to Alan,

30:53.820 --> 30:55.388
which we couldn't risk
you honoring.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.657
Not at the expense
of the firm.

30:56.690 --> 30:58.058
The firm?

30:58.091 --> 30:59.259
The firm is you,

30:59.292 --> 31:00.834
it's me, and it's Jimmy!

31:00.867 --> 31:02.135
YOUNG: And Jamie and Tara!

31:02.168 --> 31:03.269
Who you just fired!

31:03.303 --> 31:04.938
Because she betrayed us!
Eugene!

31:04.971 --> 31:06.873
He had to go. I don't care
how much money he brought in.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.408
He lied,
he broke all the rules.

31:08.441 --> 31:10.010
He served
every one of us.

31:10.043 --> 31:11.344
No, he did not!

31:14.480 --> 31:17.117
The firm Bobby Donnell
turned over to us

31:17.150 --> 31:18.952
is one of integrity.

31:18.985 --> 31:21.421
The name on this place,
its reputation,

31:21.454 --> 31:22.589
it means something.

31:22.623 --> 31:24.257
That man

31:24.290 --> 31:26.459
demeans the practice of law.

31:26.492 --> 31:27.628
He demeaned this firm.

31:27.661 --> 31:28.595
He disrespected you,

31:28.629 --> 31:29.796
Jimmy, and me.

31:29.830 --> 31:32.298
I don't care if we have
to scrape for rent.

31:32.332 --> 31:35.268
This firm will always

31:35.301 --> 31:37.638
maintain its dignity.

31:41.174 --> 31:44.210
Character has to count
for something, Ellenor,

31:44.244 --> 31:45.812
and if it does,

31:47.480 --> 31:49.650
that man has no place.

31:49.683 --> 31:52.619
(music playing)

32:00.026 --> 32:01.234
STRINGER:
We need to get going.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.003
Jamie, can you close
without me there?

32:04.037 --> 32:05.171
Um, sure.

32:05.205 --> 32:07.874
I'm just in no
emotional state to, uh.

32:08.542 --> 32:10.343
I understand.

32:10.376 --> 32:11.745
Uh, I'm fine.

32:14.414 --> 32:15.616
Uh, If the judge asks,
I'll just tell him

32:15.649 --> 32:16.850
you're not feeling
very well.

32:17.483 --> 32:18.251
Thank you.

32:23.089 --> 32:24.457
I better get to court.

32:30.463 --> 32:31.397
Hmm.

32:31.431 --> 32:33.700
Seems funner than before.

32:33.734 --> 32:36.102
YOUNG: Lucy, did all
the letters go out?

32:36.136 --> 32:37.638
I checked. They're out.

32:38.839 --> 32:39.673
YOUNG: Okay.

32:40.206 --> 32:42.042
Uh, thank you for, uh.

32:42.909 --> 32:44.244
No problem.

32:54.655 --> 32:56.356
Everyone says
frivolous lawsuits

32:56.389 --> 32:58.024
are destroying medicine.

32:58.058 --> 32:59.760
Insurance companies
blame lawyers

32:59.793 --> 33:00.901
for driving up
health costs.

33:00.934 --> 33:02.869
But you know what?

33:02.903 --> 33:04.237
It's a lie.

33:04.638 --> 33:06.907
Malpractice suits
are down nationally,

33:06.940 --> 33:08.008
doctors and hospitals

33:08.041 --> 33:10.611
are making more money
than ever.

33:10.644 --> 33:12.779
The most recent study shows

33:12.813 --> 33:14.114
that for every
lawsuit filed,

33:14.147 --> 33:17.183
there are at least 10 acts
of gross malpractice

33:17.217 --> 33:19.653
that never lead
to any action.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.255
New laws are making it
harder and harder

33:22.288 --> 33:24.090
to even bring these cases,

33:24.124 --> 33:28.094
yet almost
100,000 Americans

33:28.128 --> 33:30.831
died last year because doctors
and hospitals

33:30.864 --> 33:32.766
made mistakes.

33:33.133 --> 33:36.269
One hundred thousand.

33:37.270 --> 33:41.508
Mary Quillen died because
she couldn't afford a c-section.

33:41.542 --> 33:42.876
That's worse than negligence,

33:42.909 --> 33:44.110
it's discrimination.

33:44.144 --> 33:46.647
And it happens every day.

33:47.047 --> 33:49.683
It's somehow
become bad business

33:49.716 --> 33:51.151
to treat the poor.

33:51.184 --> 33:54.154
And health care has become
a national disgrace.

33:56.356 --> 33:58.559
A message needs to be sent.

33:59.660 --> 34:02.268
I don't have the power.

34:02.302 --> 34:03.537
But you do.

34:20.687 --> 34:22.288
This country,
the richest on Earth,

34:22.322 --> 34:23.524
fails to provide

34:23.556 --> 34:26.259
adequate prenatal care
to poor women.

34:27.060 --> 34:29.730
Had Mary been able
to get a prenatal exam,

34:29.763 --> 34:30.864
Dr. Platt would have known

34:30.897 --> 34:32.599
that her uterus
was abnormal,

34:32.632 --> 34:34.668
and he likely would have
ordered that c-section.

34:34.701 --> 34:37.003
But because he didn't know,

34:37.036 --> 34:38.138
he had no basis

34:38.170 --> 34:40.106
for performing
a c-section on her

34:40.139 --> 34:41.675
until it was too late.

34:42.342 --> 34:44.476
One reason for the state of
health care in this country,

34:44.511 --> 34:47.213
by the way, a big reason,
litigation.

34:47.246 --> 34:49.482
Your Honor?
She opened the door on this.

34:50.016 --> 34:50.917
I'll allow it.

34:51.952 --> 34:53.820
SEABURY: Fear of litigation

34:53.853 --> 34:56.089
is driving health care
costs into orbit.

34:56.556 --> 34:57.991
Doctors routinely order

34:58.024 --> 35:00.534
expensive tests
to cover themselves

35:00.567 --> 35:02.035
in case they get sued.

35:02.068 --> 35:03.870
And according
to Newsweek magazine

35:03.904 --> 35:06.607
we waste $50

35:06.640 --> 35:08.575
to $100 billion dollars,

35:08.609 --> 35:09.910
billion,

35:09.943 --> 35:12.445
on what's called
"defensive medicine."

35:13.079 --> 35:14.881
Physicians are now
afraid to discuss

35:14.915 --> 35:16.149
their mistakes
with each other,

35:16.182 --> 35:19.285
because candor can be used
against them in court.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.388
But you know
the worst part,

35:23.957 --> 35:26.092
good doctors,

35:26.126 --> 35:28.261
men and women
in the business of healing,

35:28.294 --> 35:30.396
like Dr. Platt,
are being driven out,

35:30.430 --> 35:32.799
because they can't
afford coverage.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.936
He couldn't foresee
an abnormal uterus.

35:35.969 --> 35:38.438
This wasn't his fault.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.242
But hey,
anybody and everybody

35:42.275 --> 35:43.109
gets to sue.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.211
The problem is,

35:45.245 --> 35:46.379
win or lose,

35:46.412 --> 35:47.781
he loses.

35:50.116 --> 35:51.351
And so do we all.

36:17.684 --> 36:19.185
(doorbell rings)

36:26.292 --> 36:27.928
Hey.
Is he here?

36:28.461 --> 36:30.330
Oh, I've been calling him,
actually.

36:30.363 --> 36:31.865
I'm trying him again now.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.099
SHORE (over recording): Hello,
you've reached Alan Shore.

36:33.133 --> 36:34.768
I'm currently
with a prostitute.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.269
If you'd like to leave
a message--

36:36.302 --> 36:38.505
I have left him
six messages.

36:38.539 --> 36:40.140
He's not returning.

36:40.707 --> 36:41.942
Okay.

36:43.644 --> 36:44.878
Listen, Tara,

36:44.911 --> 36:46.980
I'm very sorry that it--

36:47.614 --> 36:49.916
I deserved to get fired,

36:49.950 --> 36:51.785
Ellenor.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.987
I betrayed Eugene.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.557
I'm willing to accept
responsibility for it.

37:00.499 --> 37:02.468
If I hear from him,
I'll let you know.

37:03.202 --> 37:05.304
Okay. Thanks.

37:09.776 --> 37:12.712
(music playing)

37:24.224 --> 37:25.559
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

37:26.326 --> 37:27.828
Yes, we have,
Your Honor.

37:28.194 --> 37:29.730
MANTLE: Question one,

37:29.763 --> 37:32.032
was the hospital
or Dr. Platt negligent

37:32.065 --> 37:33.634
in the death
of Mary Quillen?

37:33.667 --> 37:34.535
How say you?

37:35.869 --> 37:39.339
FOREPERSON: We, the jury,
find Dr. Platt and the hospital

37:39.773 --> 37:41.107
guilty of negligence.

37:42.743 --> 37:44.878
MANTLE: Question two
refers to damages.

37:45.679 --> 37:47.347
Have you reached a decision
on that question?

37:47.380 --> 37:48.682
FOREPERSON: Yes, Your Honor.

37:48.715 --> 37:52.285
We, the jury, find Dr. Platt
and the hospital

37:52.318 --> 37:54.621
jointly and severally liable,

37:54.655 --> 37:57.157
and order them to pay
the Quillen family

37:57.190 --> 37:59.259
$3.6 million.

38:00.333 --> 38:02.268
SEABURY: Defense moves
to reduce the judgment

38:02.302 --> 38:04.505
to the statutory cap
of $20,000.

38:04.538 --> 38:06.940
Opposed. Your Honor has
the discretion to lift the cap.

38:06.973 --> 38:08.809
SEABURY: There is no authority
for that discretion

38:08.842 --> 38:09.910
in the legislative
definition--

38:09.943 --> 38:11.745
Your Honor can rely on
precedent or judgements--

38:11.778 --> 38:13.614
Those precedents are certainly
not binding, Your Honor..

38:13.647 --> 38:14.548
The law is wrong!

38:15.716 --> 38:17.417
Which is exactly why
most states

38:17.450 --> 38:19.953
did away with the
charity caps 50 years ago.

38:22.689 --> 38:24.525
You're right,
Ms. Stringer.

38:24.558 --> 38:26.793
The law is archaic

38:26.827 --> 38:28.161
perhaps even immoral.

38:30.531 --> 38:32.132
But as a judge,

38:32.165 --> 38:33.900
I'm bound to uphold it.

38:34.367 --> 38:38.138
The verdict of $3.6 million
is vacated by statute.

38:38.705 --> 38:41.775
The verdict is capped
at $20,000.

38:41.808 --> 38:44.010
Members of the jury,
you're dismissed with thanks.

38:44.044 --> 38:45.746
This matter is adjourned.

38:55.622 --> 38:56.690
I'm sorry.

38:57.090 --> 38:58.124
We'll appeal,

38:58.158 --> 38:59.993
and we'll ask
for the full judgment.

39:00.026 --> 39:01.034
But--

39:01.067 --> 39:02.135
It's okay.

39:02.168 --> 39:04.971
You at least
got a verdict.

39:05.005 --> 39:06.406
I'm grateful for that.

39:07.608 --> 39:08.274
Maybe...

39:09.309 --> 39:10.410
it'll be heard.

39:11.311 --> 39:12.579
Let's hope so.

39:14.548 --> 39:16.382
I wish you well, Tom.

39:16.416 --> 39:17.350
Thank you.

39:17.383 --> 39:19.720
And please thank
Ellenor for me.

39:20.220 --> 39:21.254
I will.

39:21.287 --> 39:24.224
(music playing)

39:45.078 --> 39:47.981
(indistinct chatter)

40:02.102 --> 40:02.869
What's new?

40:10.877 --> 40:12.613
I'm sorry.

40:12.646 --> 40:14.014
I didn't know.

40:14.047 --> 40:15.582
I know you didn't.

40:17.450 --> 40:19.019
I'm gonna try
to dissuade them.

40:19.052 --> 40:20.521
Ellenor

40:20.554 --> 40:22.989
it's a place of work,
nothing more.

40:26.292 --> 40:28.729
It's the little things
in life I...

40:30.196 --> 40:31.798
find annoying.

40:34.234 --> 40:36.903
If you could just get
Tara's job back.

40:37.470 --> 40:39.806
She didn't...

40:39.840 --> 40:40.807
deserve--

40:42.643 --> 40:44.177
Hey,

40:44.210 --> 40:45.211
my friend,

40:48.014 --> 40:49.850
you and I are going to see
a lot of each other.

40:51.351 --> 40:52.653
Everything's fine,
Ellenor,

40:52.686 --> 40:53.820
I promise.

40:55.756 --> 40:58.559
I'd even go so far as to say
it's all for the best, so...

40:59.793 --> 41:01.535
let's see a smile.

41:01.968 --> 41:02.969
(scoffs)

41:06.907 --> 41:09.342
I didn't figure
you'd go so quietly.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.281
Who said anything about
going quietly?

41:19.052 --> 41:21.287
Ellenor,
I give you my word

41:21.321 --> 41:23.323
this is going to get very...

41:24.858 --> 41:26.593
ugly.

41:26.627 --> 41:27.594
Not to worry.

41:27.628 --> 41:30.564
(music playing)

41:52.418 --> 41:55.355
(music playing)

42:18.852 --> 42:19.853
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:19.886 --> 42:22.889
(music playing)
