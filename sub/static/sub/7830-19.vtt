<i>the bake sale to raise money</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:35.035

00:40.749 --> 00:43.168

00:43.251 --> 00:46.212
Oh! It's hard enough
to keep the kids awake

00:46.296 --> 00:47.255
without you, Seymour.

00:51.926 --> 00:52.844
(all gasping)

00:52.927 --> 00:54.012
Mrs. Krabappel,

00:54.095 --> 00:56.056
I also have
an announcement to make.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.140
Can't it wait
till I retire?

00:57.223 --> 00:58.641
(clears throat)

00:58.725 --> 01:01.061
I want one and all
to join me in celebrating

01:01.144 --> 01:03.271
the anniversary
of my portentous birth.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.272
Here you are, Nelson.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.857
A birthday party?

01:05.940 --> 01:08.026
(blows raspberry)

01:08.109 --> 01:09.319
Here you are, Nelson.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.321
(blows raspberry)

01:11.404 --> 01:12.655
Here you are, Nelson.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.115
I said...
(blows raspberry)

01:14.199 --> 01:16.117
(engine revving)

01:16.201 --> 01:17.118
All right, men.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.411
Get ready to blast off.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.412
Whoo!

01:19.496 --> 01:20.914
We're in orbit now.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.083
What's that?
A call from the president?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.250
Hello?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.044
(imitating Nixon):
Ah, yes.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.130
Let me just say this
about that.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.298
Okay, Mr. President.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.092
Bart, this is boring.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.929
I guess we could go
to Martin's party.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.388
I don't know.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.515
If we're seen there,
it'll definitely take

01:38.598 --> 01:40.308
our social standing
down a notch.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.976
We're at what now?
Three?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.311
Three and a half.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.271
We get beat up,
but we get an explanation.

01:45.355 --> 01:49.234
(continues imitating Nixon)
Beautiful colors. Never has--

01:49.317 --> 01:51.152

01:57.700 --> 01:58.743
Hmm.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.372
Bart!

02:02.455 --> 02:04.415
Uh, Mrs. K.
Hey, it's Saturday.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.084
Your powers are useless
against me.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.254
Relax. I'm just here to have
fun like everybody else.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.131
Don't think of me
as a teacher.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.340
Okay.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.300
So...

02:14.384 --> 02:16.469
Mm-hmm.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.304
(nervous laughter)

02:18.388 --> 02:20.265
(sighing)

02:20.348 --> 02:21.266
Excuse me.

02:25.937 --> 02:26.855
(pitiful whimpering)

02:28.148 --> 02:31.734
(crying)
Mama!

02:31.818 --> 02:34.487
Hey, Houdini, why don't you
saw Martin in half?

02:34.571 --> 02:37.157
Oh, I'm not the kind of magician
who does tricks.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.533
I'm a math-e-magician.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.534
(all groaning)

02:39.617 --> 02:41.077
Oh, man.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.288
Now, prepare to marvel
at the mysteries of the universe

02:43.371 --> 02:46.416
as I make this remainder
disappear.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.375
(chuckling)

02:49.127 --> 02:51.713
But seven goes
into 28 four times.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.465
Uh-- this is a magic seven!

02:54.549 --> 02:57.010
(children chattering)

03:01.472 --> 03:02.849
Edna!

03:02.932 --> 03:04.267
Seymour.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.351
Mind if I sit down?

03:05.435 --> 03:06.769
Hmph! It's a free country.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.313
I...
I don't follow you.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.190
Oh, just sit down,
Seymour.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.943
It might be nice to talk
to a grownup for a change.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.821
Well, this party is certainly
a break in my routine.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.948
You know, normally
I spend my Saturdays

03:19.032 --> 03:21.242
carefully laying out my clothes
for the following week.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.871
Then I stroll down to the car wash
to see if Gus is there.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.789
Oh, yeah. You've got
to keep busy.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.542
I collect matchbooks
from glamorous nightclubs.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.002
It's amazing.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.713
It you just write to them
and ask them nicely...

03:36.382 --> 03:37.383
Is this...

03:37.467 --> 03:39.010
How you imagined
your life, Edna?

03:39.093 --> 03:42.555
Well, yes, but then,
I was a very depressed child.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.432
To poor decisions.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.267
Hear, hear.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.394
WOMAN:
Seymour! I told you

03:48.478 --> 03:50.230
not to play
in the neighbor's yard.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.272
It's a party,
Mother.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.066
I was invited.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.442
Well...

03:54.525 --> 03:56.945
Then I must've been
invited, too.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.821
Help me, Edna.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.661
I know where we can hole up
for a while.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.667
(crying)

04:10.750 --> 04:12.460
That's it.
Looking good.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.836
Getting warm.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.298
Uh... I feel queasy.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.299
Don't stop, Milhouse.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.634
You're so close.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.969
I got to barf.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.430
Where's the bathroom?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.183
(kids screaming)

04:27.267 --> 04:29.310
(all moaning and groaning)

04:29.394 --> 04:32.438
Oh, my tummy!

04:32.522 --> 04:35.400
I told you we should've served
cake instead of oysters.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.277
I'm ruined!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.153
Ha-ha!

04:39.237 --> 04:41.197
(groaning)

04:41.281 --> 04:42.490
(siren wails)

04:46.369 --> 04:48.079
(Lisa groaning)

04:48.162 --> 04:49.872
Bart, how come
you're not sick?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.874
Eh! I gave my oysters
to the cat.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.252
(retching)

04:54.335 --> 04:55.336
Hey, why'd you eat them?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.587
I thought
you were a vegetarian.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.756
I didn't. I just
wanted to leave.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.008
(fake groaning)

05:01.634 --> 05:03.052
More tea, Edna?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.346
What kind of little boy
has a tea set?

05:05.430 --> 05:08.224
Hmm! I think we both
know the answer to that.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.642
A lucky boy.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.936
You know, Seymour,

05:12.020 --> 05:14.897
there's an innocence about you
that can be quite charming.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.943
Oh! Well, I've always admired
your tart honesty

05:19.027 --> 05:22.071
and ability to be personally offended
by broad social trends.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.489
Oh, really?

05:23.573 --> 05:24.949
Mm-hmm. Very much.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.117
And your laugh.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.744
You mean, "Ha"?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.538
Mm-hmm. That's the one
that makes me feel...

05:30.621 --> 05:32.415
(breathing heavily)

05:32.498 --> 05:34.792
Oh, boy.
(clears throat)

05:34.876 --> 05:36.794
You have a breath mint
I could borrow?

05:36.878 --> 05:38.796
I've got
some menthol cigarettes.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.715
Oh, the heck with it.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.110
BART: You are never going to guess
what I saw at Martin's party

06:01.194 --> 06:03.071
after you guys left.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.155
You know that playhouse?
Well, I--

06:04.238 --> 06:05.573
-Good gravy!
-Oh, thank you.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.076
It's just brown and water.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.952
So I looked in the window
and there it was.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.205
The grossest sight
I have ever...

06:12.288 --> 06:14.165
SKINNER (on PA):
<i>Bart Simpson, report to</i>

06:14.248 --> 06:15.208
<i>the principal's office</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:17.877
Now, Bart... son...

06:17.960 --> 06:19.796
I don't know
what you think you saw

06:19.879 --> 06:21.839
but, let me assure you...

06:21.923 --> 06:23.383
What Seymour... Oh...

06:23.466 --> 06:25.093
What Principal Skinner
means to say, Bart,

06:25.176 --> 06:26.969
is that sometimes
a little boy's imagination

06:27.053 --> 06:28.054
can run away with him.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.223
That's the best
you can do?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.350
You could have at least said
you were giving her C.P.R.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.768
or rehearsing a play.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.396
Is it too late
to say that?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.438
Mm-hmm.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.815
(clears throat)

06:38.898 --> 06:39.982
We're just a little concerned.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.317
If people were to find out

06:41.401 --> 06:42.735
the principal
was dating a teacher,

06:42.819 --> 06:45.071
they might see it as
a conflict of interest.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.114
(laughs)

06:46.197 --> 06:47.824
And...
There are those

06:47.907 --> 06:49.534
who might try to use it
against us

06:49.617 --> 06:50.535
for their own advantage.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.536
Like me, for one.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.580
Like you, for...

06:54.664 --> 06:57.667
Bart, if life has taught me
one lesson repeatedly,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.419
it's to know
when I'm beaten.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.711
Let's talk deal.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.638
(grunts)

07:12.974 --> 07:14.350
As you know, Bart,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.269
your permanent record
will one day disqualify you

07:16.352 --> 07:18.354
from all but the hottest
and noisiest jobs.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.689
What do you say, son?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.274
You keep our secret,

07:21.357 --> 07:22.900
and some other student
can inherit your gloomy

07:22.984 --> 07:23.860
windblown future.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.487
Deal.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.784
This is a great day
for forbidden love.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.791
Mmm. This dessert
is exquisite.

07:38.875 --> 07:39.792
What do you call it?

07:39.876 --> 07:40.877
Applesauce.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.671
(chuckles)
Oh, of course.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.340
I'm sorry. I don't get out
to restaurants much.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.718
That's okay.
I don't entertain much.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.138
Usually it's just soup
for one, salad for one,

07:52.221 --> 07:53.514
wine for three.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.183
(laughs) You know,
I always thought

07:55.266 --> 07:57.643
I'd fall for a woman
just like Mother...

07:57.727 --> 07:59.270
even though
I didn't want to.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.606
And now that I haven't,

08:01.689 --> 08:04.233
I've discovered what
true happiness can be, Edna.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.113
Seymour, swallow
that applesauce

08:09.197 --> 08:10.781
and kiss me.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.201
I'm afraid I already swallowed
it while you were talking.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.413
Mmm...

08:17.497 --> 08:18.414
(Edna giggling)

08:18.498 --> 08:19.665
Mmm...

08:22.293 --> 08:24.962
Good morning, students.
Way to go there, Wendell.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.632
There's Ralph--
He knows the score.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.634
Jimbo,
how's that hat today?

08:29.717 --> 08:31.844
Janie, Janie, bo-phaney!

08:31.928 --> 08:34.972
The only way to survive
a deadly blaze is...

08:35.056 --> 08:37.433
Oh, heck, life's too short
for fire safety.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.060
Let's go outside
and pick wild flowers.

08:39.143 --> 08:42.271
(cheering)

08:42.355 --> 08:43.981
SKINNER (on PA): <i>Bart Simpson to</i>
<i>the principal's office.</i>

08:44.065 --> 08:45.608
<i>Post haste.</i>

08:45.691 --> 08:48.069
<i>(Skinner humming</i>
<i>"Eine kleine nacht musik")</i>

08:51.739 --> 08:53.991
Bart, so good to see you.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.368
I have a little favor
to ask you.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.494
I'd like you
to give this note

08:56.577 --> 08:57.703
to Edna when you
get back to class.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.039
I don't think
I have to tell you

09:00.122 --> 09:01.499
it's for her eyes only.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.676
<i>"Dear Edna"--</i>
<i>(mumbling)</i>

09:11.759 --> 09:14.220
(sing-song)
I hear reading.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.409
Do you think
anyone saw us?

09:36.492 --> 09:39.287
No. It went
just as we planned.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.455
Except they confiscated
my thermos of cola at the door.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.124
Ohh--

09:43.207 --> 09:45.835
Skinner, Krabappel,
what are you two doing here?

09:45.918 --> 09:46.919
Superintendent Chalmers!

09:47.003 --> 09:48.296
Uh, why, we're--

09:48.379 --> 09:50.381
We're, uh, on a, uh--

09:50.464 --> 09:53.134
-a-- what do you call-- field trip.
-Uh, with a student.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.553
-Yes! He's, uh...
-He's purchasing refreshments

09:55.636 --> 09:57.930
-in the lobby.
-I'll go get him right now.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.515
(whispering)
Car keys, car keys, car keys.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.319
(sleepily) Stop pushing me.
What's going on?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.112
Just enjoy the movie.
It has Tom Berenger.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.746
You think they actually
filmed this in Atlanta?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.456
I don't know.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.915
I don't think
it's important.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.042
Yeah.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.418
(honking)

10:32.381 --> 10:34.425
Mother doesn't approve
of me dating,

10:34.508 --> 10:36.886
so I need you to keep
her busy for a few hours

10:36.969 --> 10:38.638
while Edna and I sneak out.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.807
(door slams)

10:41.891 --> 10:43.934
Oh, I can't take
much more of this.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.811
I collect
pictures of cakes

10:45.895 --> 10:47.855
that I clip out
of the magazines.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.940
It all started in 1941

10:50.024 --> 10:53.653
when Good Housekeeping featured
a photo of a lovely cake.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.656
You wouldn't happen to have any
real cakes around here, would you?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.283
Oh, my no.
I don't care for cake. Too sweet.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.870
Now, this is called
a Lady Baltimore cake.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.914
At my age, I don't have
much saliva left

11:04.997 --> 11:06.374
so you'll have
to lick my thumb

11:06.457 --> 11:08.542
before
I can turn the page.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.169
Oh, can't I just turn
the page for you?

11:10.252 --> 11:11.504
No!

11:11.587 --> 11:13.381
But you can pick out
any picture

11:13.464 --> 11:15.383
you want to take home
with you.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.093
Okay.
That one.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.094
-No!
-Ow!

11:18.177 --> 11:19.387
You can't have that one!

11:19.470 --> 11:20.971
That's a coconut cake!

11:21.055 --> 11:22.264
(pencils scratching paper)

11:24.016 --> 11:26.310
Bart Simpson!

11:26.394 --> 11:29.397
How many times do I have
to tell you no talking!

11:29.480 --> 11:30.981
Report
to the principal's office!

11:31.065 --> 11:32.441
But-but I wasn't...

11:32.525 --> 11:34.276
-And here, take this with you.
-(groans)

11:34.360 --> 11:37.488
Mrs. Krabappel,
Bart has something

11:37.571 --> 11:38.531
he wants to say to you.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.824
-I won't say it!
-Bart!

11:39.907 --> 11:42.201
(groans)
Oh...

11:43.661 --> 11:46.580
I love you,
Edna Krabappel.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.582
(children laughing)

11:48.666 --> 11:50.876
(chanting)
Bart's going to marry the teacher.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.045
Where are you
registered, Simpson?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.588
(groans)

11:54.672 --> 11:55.589
Thank you, Bart.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.590
That was very sweet.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.843
You may sit down now.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.678
They're not going
to get away with this.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.556
I'm going to step out
for a few minutes, class.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.515
Martin,
you're in charge.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.518
Now, Bart, uh...

12:07.601 --> 12:08.853
(coughs)

12:08.936 --> 12:11.355
You must promise not
to fall in love with me.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.816
(children laughing)

12:13.899 --> 12:15.693
Now, Martin's scoring
off me.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.069
Oh, that is it.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.571
Listen up, everybody!

12:18.654 --> 12:20.030
Follow me!

12:23.325 --> 12:24.577
What's going on, huh?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.620
What's happening,
Simpson?

12:26.704 --> 12:27.747
Where are we going,
anyway?

12:29.248 --> 12:30.458
Okay, crew...

12:30.541 --> 12:32.585
Set your faces to stunned.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.839
(all gasp)

12:40.926 --> 12:43.429
Um...

12:43.512 --> 12:45.389
Um...

12:45.473 --> 12:46.348
School dismissed.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.227
And then Bart
opened the door

12:50.311 --> 12:51.979
and Principal Skinner
and Mrs. Krabappel

12:52.062 --> 12:53.355
were kissing!

12:53.439 --> 12:54.982
-(gasps)
-And swearing.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.776
Father, Uncle Apu,

12:56.859 --> 12:58.986
a teacher was in the closet
with the principal

12:59.069 --> 13:01.071
and he had as many arms
as Vishnu

13:01.155 --> 13:02.907
and they were
all very busy.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.658
-(gasps)
-Wow.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.827
I was in the library,
at the time,

13:06.911 --> 13:08.412
but Janie told me
that Principal Skinner

13:08.496 --> 13:09.872
and Bart's teacher, Mrs...

13:09.955 --> 13:10.873
What's her name?

13:10.956 --> 13:11.874
Krabappel?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.292
Yeah, Krabappel.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.919
They were naked
in the closet together.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.712
Oh, my goodness!

13:16.796 --> 13:18.172
Wait a minute.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.382
Bart's teacher
is named "Krabappel"?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.635
I've been calling her
"Crandall."

13:22.718 --> 13:25.054
Why didn't someone tell me?

13:25.137 --> 13:28.265
Oh, I've been making
an idiot out of myself!

13:28.349 --> 13:30.559
Mrs. Krabappel
and Principal Skinner

13:30.643 --> 13:32.269
were in the closet
making babies,

13:32.353 --> 13:33.938
and I saw one of the babies,

13:34.021 --> 13:36.315
and the baby looked at me.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.067
Baby looked at you?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.611
Sara, get me
Superintendent Chalmers.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.281
-Thank you, Sara.
-Hmm.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.494
-Skinner!
-Uh, Superintendent Chalmers.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.539
The whole town's in an uproar
about your sleazy shenanigans.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.207
Now, I'm going to
give you a choice.

13:53.290 --> 13:57.086
You can give up this tawdry
fulfilling relationship

13:57.169 --> 13:58.963
or you two will be
out of here so fast

13:59.046 --> 14:00.172
your mortarboards
will spin.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.550
And where is
your mortarboard anyway?

14:02.633 --> 14:03.926
Uh... Right here, sir.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.346
So, what'll it be, Seymour?

14:07.429 --> 14:09.682
Well...

14:09.765 --> 14:13.310
I'm sorry, but, uh, I can't
give up the woman I love.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.522
Well, then I'm afraid
you leave me no choice.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.858
I want you out
of the building by 3:00.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.236
-You're fired. Edna, too.
-(gasps)

14:25.197 --> 14:28.492
Well, it's going to be hard
to say good-bye to all of you.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.327
We've had a lot
of fun together.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.708
Nelson, Nelson, Nelson.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.585
How many kids
have you beaten up this year?

14:37.668 --> 14:38.919
I don't know-- 50.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.755
Ah, 50.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.049
Where does the time go?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.430
You, uh, you wanted to see me,
Principal Skinner?

14:49.513 --> 14:51.765
Mm-mm.
It's Mr. Skinner now.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.392
I'm just a man.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.312
Bart, I want to apologize
for the awkward position

14:56.395 --> 14:57.938
Edna and I put you in.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.608
Your-- Your help made
our love possible.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.026
I don't know
what we'll do without you.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.195
Well, so long.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.825
Wait a second!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.160
You don't have to leave
just because

15:11.243 --> 15:13.203
Superintendent Chalmers
told you to.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.204
What are you getting at?

15:14.288 --> 15:15.497
You spent your whole life

15:15.581 --> 15:17.333
following orders--
from your mother

15:17.416 --> 15:19.627
the army,
Superintendent Chalmers...

15:19.710 --> 15:23.047
Just this once, man,
stand up for yourself.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.131
Okay, Bart.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.132
Let's go, Seymour.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.884
Okay, Edna.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.261
Uh... No, wait!

15:29.345 --> 15:31.013
We're not going anywhere.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.390
I'm going to do what Bart
should have told me to do

15:33.474 --> 15:34.975
a long time ago.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.064
Attention, Springfield.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.608
We have barricaded ourselves
in the school

15:42.691 --> 15:46.028
and are not coming down
until our demands are met.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.614
Willie hears you.
Willie don't care.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.408
Obviously, you two
have no experience

15:51.492 --> 15:52.743
causing a scene.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.041
I'll be right there.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.292
All right people,

16:00.376 --> 16:01.669
we've got
an escaped octopus

16:01.752 --> 16:02.670
on the roof
of Springfield Elementary.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.671
Let's roll.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.630
Two cameras.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.301
So, once again,
I've been had.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.512
But an even more
interesting story

16:11.595 --> 16:14.264
has developed high atop
this two-story school:

16:14.348 --> 16:15.724
A love story.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.768
Skinner,
get off of my school.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.688
No.
You get off of my school.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.606
Homer,
Bart's up there!

16:22.690 --> 16:24.274
Give me that!

16:24.358 --> 16:26.944
Bart,
this is your father!

16:27.027 --> 16:30.698
Do you know
where the remote is?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.616
I looked
all over the house.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.910
Did you check
your pocket?

16:36.286 --> 16:37.413
It was--

16:37.496 --> 16:38.497
It was in my pocket.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.007
Fine.
Stay in the school.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.842
We don't want you
to come out.

16:49.925 --> 16:50.884
BART: You got it.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.553
Damn.
All right, boys,

16:52.636 --> 16:53.971
roll up the sound truck.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.764
We'll blast them out
with music.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.227
(feeedback squeals)

17:00.310 --> 17:03.105
(melodic acoustic piano
playing "Embraceable you")

17:12.406 --> 17:14.533
<i>♪ Embrace me, my sweet... ♪</i>

17:14.616 --> 17:17.786
Oh, Edna, I hope
this siege never ends.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.414
Seymour, you're heaven
in hush puppies.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.665
Oh...

17:21.749 --> 17:23.667
Turn the music off!

17:23.751 --> 17:26.336
Ha! It's working
like a charm, boys.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.755
Now cut the power
and hit them with the lights.

17:30.299 --> 17:34.136
<i>♪ ...Irreplaceable you ♪</i>

17:35.971 --> 17:39.266
<i>♪ Just one look at you ♪</i>

17:39.349 --> 17:42.311
<i>♪ My heart grew tipsy... ♪</i>

17:42.394 --> 17:43.520
Ugh!

17:50.027 --> 17:52.988
-(ringing)
-I'll get it.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.116
-Talk to me.
-You have got to end this thing, Seymour.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.952
We're not coming down
until our jobs are reinstated

17:59.036 --> 18:01.080
and you acknowledge
and celebrate our love.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.624
No one would like to celebrate
your love more than I

18:03.707 --> 18:05.292
but I'm a public servant

18:05.375 --> 18:07.795
and not permitted to use
my own judgment in any way.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.130
Then let us take our case
directly to the towns people.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.174
Oh, yeah, that'll be
real productive.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.342
Who do you want
to talk to first?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.010
The guy in the bumblebee suit

18:15.094 --> 18:16.345
or the one with the bone
through his hair?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.388
My opinions
are as valid

18:18.472 --> 18:19.765
as the next man's!

18:19.848 --> 18:21.975
Yeah, all right.
Just come on down.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.186
Well... This is it.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.395
What are you going to do?

18:25.479 --> 18:26.980
I'm going to go out there

18:27.064 --> 18:28.941
and tell every man,
woman and child

18:29.024 --> 18:30.901
that I love
Edna krabappel.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.361
Well, that's nice,

18:32.444 --> 18:33.403
but first you got to grab
their attention.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.280
And I think I know how.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.202
I have a bomb.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.122
ALL:
(gasping and murmuring)

18:43.205 --> 18:44.248
Hey, wait a minute.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.208
Those are hot dogs.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.626
Armour hot dogs.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.754
What kind of man wears
Armour hot dogs?

18:50.838 --> 18:52.214
It was a good idea, Bart,

18:52.297 --> 18:54.383
but it's just not working.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.885
Just speak
from the heart, Seymour.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.054
Tell them how we brought
a little happiness

18:59.138 --> 19:00.681
into each other's lives.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.851
Ask them why they're forcing
two dedicated people

19:03.934 --> 19:06.311
to choose between their
careers and their hearts.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.980
Excuse me, Edna.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.899
I don't think we're talking
about love here.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.110
We're talking about s-e-x

19:13.193 --> 19:16.196
in front
of the c-h-i-l-d-r-e-n.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.406
Sex Cauldron?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.199
I thought they closed
that place down.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.201
What are you people
talking about?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.412
My child told me
you two were having sex

19:23.495 --> 19:24.830
in the school janitor's
closet.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.915
You know, "Making babies"?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.458
Yes, illicit sex.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.252
Doing it! It! It!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.421
Sordid public sexual
congress!

19:32.504 --> 19:34.089
This is absurd.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.341
I did not have relations
in that closet,

19:36.425 --> 19:38.427
and the fact is,
I haven't...

19:38.510 --> 19:40.304
Uh...

19:40.387 --> 19:43.265
(crickets chirping)

19:43.348 --> 19:45.642
Yes?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.603
Seymour, I think
you'd better tell them.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.314
It's the only way
to clear our names.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.443
(sighs)

19:54.526 --> 19:56.486
Well, everyone,
the fact is

19:56.570 --> 20:00.324
I haven't ever
had relations.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.283
I am a virgin.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.495
Ha-ha!

20:05.579 --> 20:07.497
(all murmuring)

20:09.750 --> 20:11.460
Hey, does this mean

20:11.543 --> 20:13.337
that Mrs. Krabappel
is a virgin, too?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.546
KRABAPPEL:
Ha!

20:14.630 --> 20:16.340
Well, Seymour,
it's clear

20:16.423 --> 20:18.050
you've been falsely accused

20:18.133 --> 20:22.346
because no one...
anywhere... ever...

20:22.429 --> 20:25.515
Would pretend to be
a 44-year-old virgin.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.934
Oh, that's for sure.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.645
I'm, I'm inclined to agree.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.314
Ugh! I'll never look
at him the same again.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.149
That was more than
I wanted to know.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.484
(clears throat)

20:35.567 --> 20:37.527
Okay, well, um,
Edna, Seymour,

20:37.611 --> 20:41.073
in light of these, uh...
uh... revelations

20:41.156 --> 20:43.700
I, uh, suppose we,
uh... overreacted.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.160
Do we have our jobs back?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.371
What?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.748
Just, uh, you know,
keep the lewdness to a minimum.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.674
I'm out of here.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.801
Skinny, Krabby,
catch you later.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.344
Uh, hold on, Bart.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.221
May we have
a word with you?

21:04.304 --> 21:05.472
We want to thank you
for helping us

21:05.555 --> 21:06.556
through
a difficult period.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.141
Oh, no problemo.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.351
So, I guess now
you'll be getting married

21:09.434 --> 21:11.228
or something, huh?

21:11.311 --> 21:14.356
Well, actually, Seymour and I
have decided to break up.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.649
Huh?

21:15.732 --> 21:17.317
We can't continue on like this,

21:17.401 --> 21:19.319
trying to build a private
relationship in public--

21:19.403 --> 21:21.280
The whole town
watching our every move

21:21.363 --> 21:22.656
with a fine-tooth comb.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.408
Mm-hmm. I'm used
to humiliation

21:24.491 --> 21:26.201
but not in front
of a crowd that size.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.412
But you seemed
like such a good couple.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.456
Bart, when you get
a little older

21:31.540 --> 21:33.417
you're going to learn
that, sometimes, romances

21:33.500 --> 21:35.919
don't turn out exactly
the way you'd like them to.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.129
Hmm...

21:39.464 --> 21:41.758
That's why I love
elementary school, Edna:

21:41.842 --> 21:44.219
The children believe
anything you tell them.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.389
(chuckling)

21:47.472 --> 21:50.309
(both laughing)

21:50.392 --> 21:51.518
(cork popping)

21:51.601 --> 21:53.145
KRABAPPEL:
Whoo! Oh, Seymour...
