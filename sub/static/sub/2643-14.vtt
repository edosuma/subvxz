00:03.540 --> 00:04.510
Good evening.

00:04.540 --> 00:07.540
I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:12.860 --> 00:16.500
I was expecting applause,

00:16.500 --> 00:20.290
but I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.950
I agreed to speak
to you this evening,

00:22.950 --> 00:26.120
because I was told that you're
the best and the brightest

00:26.120 --> 00:28.360
of this university's
doctoral candidates.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.340
Hmm. Of course,
that's like saying

00:30.350 --> 00:33.650
you are the most important
electron in a hydrogen atom.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.070
'Cause, you see,

00:39.170 --> 00:43.440
there's only one electron
in a hydrogen atom.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.750
Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.410
All right, let's begin.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.830
Show of hands,
who here is familiar

00:51.830 --> 00:54.490
with the concept
of topological insulators?

00:55.390 --> 00:56.990
Don't kid yourselves.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.960
I found another tweet from a
student at Sheldon's lecture.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.800
"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject

01:04.800 --> 01:08.300
"and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.300
Plus, he looks
like a giant insect."

01:12.200 --> 01:13.500
Look. Listen to this one.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.110
"Does Einstein's theory
explain why time flies

01:17.110 --> 01:18.240
"when you're having fun,

01:18.240 --> 01:20.310
"but when you're listening
to Dr. Cooper,

01:20.310 --> 01:21.980
it falls out of the sky, dead?"

01:23.150 --> 01:24.480
Ooh, somebody took pictures

01:24.480 --> 01:27.350
and uploaded them
to their Flickr account.

01:27.350 --> 01:28.750
Wow.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.490
How do you get an
entire lecture hall

01:30.490 --> 01:32.820
to flip you off
at the same time?

01:32.820 --> 01:34.460
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,

01:34.460 --> 01:36.930
all you need
to do is turn your back.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.700
Hey, Leonard,
is your wi-fi down?

01:39.700 --> 01:40.660
I can't get on.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.130
Oh, Sheldon changed
the password.

01:42.130 --> 01:44.370
It's now
"Penny is a freeloader."

01:45.340 --> 01:46.740
No spaces.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.770
Thanks.
What are you guys doing?

01:48.770 --> 01:50.540
Sheldon gave a lecture
at the university tonight.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.810
We're reading
the reviews.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.140
Oh. How'd he do?

01:53.140 --> 01:55.280
Well, picture the Hindenburg
meets Chernobyl

01:55.280 --> 01:57.850
meets Three Mile Island
meets <i>Tron 2.</i>

01:57.850 --> 02:00.070
That bad, huh?

02:00.070 --> 02:02.400
Read this woman's tweet.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.820
"Listening to Dr. Cooper

02:04.820 --> 02:07.320
has made me want to start
cutting myself again""

02:07.330 --> 02:09.030
Yeah.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.100
Good evening,
Leonard, Howard, Raj,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.400
freeloader.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.400
So, how'd the lecture go?

02:18.400 --> 02:21.210
In a word, triumphant.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.540
Really? Triumphant?

02:24.540 --> 02:26.480
Oh, yes, you should have
seen those young people.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.550
Thirsty for knowledge,
drinking in my wisdom.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.680
I may have changed
a few lives today.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.850
Oh, please let
me tell him.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.660
I don't know,
I kind of promised Howard.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.640
Tell me what?

02:40.640 --> 02:42.230
Actually, we should
all share the moment.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.660
Raj, if you would.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.030
Oh, tweets about my lecture.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.240
Hmm...

02:54.240 --> 02:56.870
That's rather unfair.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.440
That's downright cruel.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.910
Plus, insects
have six legs.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.920
Yeah, I'm not familiar
with the acronym "KMN""

03:05.920 --> 03:09.490
From the context, we think
it means "kill me now."

03:12.620 --> 03:16.460
Well, I suppose everyone's
entitled to their own opinion.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.200
I think I'll turn in.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.530
I didn't want to teach
those poopy heads, anyway.

03:26.070 --> 03:28.710
FYI, I think that's
what Darth Vader said

03:28.710 --> 03:31.810
just before he started
building the Death Star.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.670
Sheldon still moping?

03:59.730 --> 04:00.990
Yeah, it's weird.
Even though he didn't want

04:00.990 --> 04:02.390
to give the lecture
in the first place,

04:02.390 --> 04:04.730
being rejected by those students
really hit him hard.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.180
I know the feeling.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.070
It's like accidentally
walking into a gay bar

04:08.070 --> 04:09.670
and then having
no one hit on you.

04:16.510 --> 04:21.279
It-It happened
to a friend of mine.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.450
Are you guys doing okay?

04:23.450 --> 04:24.850
Leonard and I are fine,

04:24.850 --> 04:27.690
but I think Raj needs
to meet a girl really soon.

04:28.590 --> 04:29.750
Well, that shouldn't
be too hard.

04:29.760 --> 04:30.860
He's such a cutie.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.960
Thank you,
but "cute" is for bunnies.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.930
I want to be something
with sex appeal,

04:34.930 --> 04:38.100
like...
like a labradoodle.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.900
Labradoodle?

04:40.900 --> 04:44.840
We might be starting
to zero in on your problem.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.600
Don't you listen to them.

04:46.610 --> 04:48.310
You've got plenty
of sex appeal.

04:48.310 --> 04:49.440
You really think so?

04:49.440 --> 04:50.690
Yeah. You're a hottie.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.510
Well, thanks, Bernadette.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.330
And just for the record,

04:56.330 --> 04:58.020
labradoodles are
hypo-allergenic,

04:58.020 --> 05:01.520
which is a very sexy quality to
those troubled by animal dander.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.490
AMY
So, what do you think?

05:08.790 --> 05:12.530
It's a charming illusion,
but it does not cheer me up.

05:12.530 --> 05:14.700
Not even when I do this?

05:20.310 --> 05:21.810
No.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.810
Well, that was the last arrow
in my quiver of whimsy.

05:27.810 --> 05:30.110
Do you realize that teaching
is the first thing

05:30.120 --> 05:32.150
I've failed at
since my ill-fated attempt

05:32.150 --> 05:35.320
to complete a chin-up
in March of 1989?

05:35.320 --> 05:37.360
If this humiliating experience

05:37.360 --> 05:38.460
is really troubling you,

05:38.460 --> 05:39.990
there are things
we could do about it.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.630
For instance?

05:41.630 --> 05:43.460
Well, the first thing
that comes to mind

05:43.460 --> 05:44.860
is isolating the part
of your brain

05:44.860 --> 05:48.370
where the memory is stored
and destroying it with a laser.

05:48.370 --> 05:50.670
Hmm, no.

05:50.670 --> 05:52.200
One slip of the hand,

05:52.200 --> 05:54.410
and suddenly I'm sitting
in the Engineering Department,

05:54.410 --> 05:57.010
building doodads with Wolowitz.

05:57.010 --> 05:58.710
All right.

05:58.710 --> 06:01.150
Have you considered improving
your socialization skills,

06:01.150 --> 06:02.380
thus allowing you

06:02.380 --> 06:03.980
to communicate more
effectively with other people?

06:03.980 --> 06:05.550
Isn't that their burden?

06:05.550 --> 06:08.550
I'm the one with something
interesting to say.

06:08.550 --> 06:11.090
Fair enough, but in its essence,

06:11.090 --> 06:12.520
teaching is a performance art.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.030
In the classroom paradigm,

06:14.030 --> 06:16.730
the teacher has the
responsibility to communicate,

06:16.730 --> 06:18.760
as well as entertain and engage.

06:18.760 --> 06:22.170
I sense that you're trying
to slow-walk me to an epiphany.

06:22.170 --> 06:24.070
Would you mind very much
jumping to it?

06:24.070 --> 06:27.570
Perhaps you should consider
taking acting lessons.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.470
Acting lessons.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.440
Interesting.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.010
It might help
if I could act as though I care

06:34.010 --> 06:37.750
about my students
and whether or not they learn.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.050
Penny.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.110
Penny. Penny.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.140
What?

06:46.140 --> 06:49.060
You're an "actress," correct?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.700
I'm not an "actress."

06:51.700 --> 06:54.100
I'm an actress.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.400
All right.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.740
You're an actress.

06:58.870 --> 07:00.300
I need you to teach me.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.710
You want an acting lesson?

07:01.710 --> 07:04.940
Perhaps two. I'd like
to master the craft.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.750
Okay, where
is this coming from?

07:07.750 --> 07:11.620
It has been suggested to
me that acting techniques

07:11.620 --> 07:13.620
could improve my
lecturing, at which,

07:13.620 --> 07:15.950
if certain tweets and
blogs are to be believed,

07:15.950 --> 07:17.860
I "suck the big one."

07:17.860 --> 07:20.560
Yeah, I saw those.
They were funny.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.460
I printed a few out
and put 'em on my fridge.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.400
So, when could we start?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.130
Okay, just to be clear.

07:27.130 --> 07:29.900
You are asking me for help
because I know something

07:29.900 --> 07:32.340
that the brilliant
Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.

07:32.340 --> 07:36.140
I suppose that's one
way to look at it.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.910
I think it's the only
way to look at it.

07:38.910 --> 07:40.810
Are you going to
help me or not?

07:40.810 --> 07:43.280
Probably. I'm just
enjoying the foreplay.

07:44.450 --> 07:46.850
Does this mean you are done
mocking my acting career?

07:46.850 --> 07:49.950
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
making the transition

07:49.960 --> 07:51.820
from actor to acting teacher

07:51.820 --> 07:53.190
was the signal
that one's career

07:53.190 --> 07:55.330
had reached the
end of the road.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.180
Forget it.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.660
I'll pay you $40.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.220
Saturday, 9:00 a.m.
Bring cash.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.570
Raj, I have amazing news!

08:06.570 --> 08:07.540
What?

08:07.540 --> 08:08.890
I just got offered
a fellowship

08:08.890 --> 08:10.880
at the Weitzmann
Institute in Israel.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.640
Dude, that's incredible!
I know.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.550
The only thing is, I'm
gonna be gone for two years.

08:15.550 --> 08:17.350
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

08:17.350 --> 08:18.480
Are you going with him?

08:18.480 --> 08:20.380
I have to stay
here for school.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.450
That's what we're here
to talk to you about.

08:22.450 --> 08:26.890
You see,
Bernadette has needs.

08:26.890 --> 08:29.530
What kind of needs?

08:29.530 --> 08:32.159
Sexual needs.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.400
Most of them regular,

08:34.400 --> 08:37.900
some of them
kind of messed up.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.669
So, while I'm gone,

08:41.669 --> 08:43.909
you're going
to have to satisfy her.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.710
What do you say?

08:48.010 --> 08:51.180
I say okey-dokey.

08:55.420 --> 08:58.220
What ya thinking
so hard about?

08:58.220 --> 09:02.360
Just that
I'm definitely not gay.

09:09.670 --> 09:11.940
SHELDON
Penny!

09:11.940 --> 09:14.700
Penny! Penny!

09:14.710 --> 09:15.610
What's wrong?

09:15.610 --> 09:18.110
Nothing.
I was acting.

09:19.880 --> 09:20.980
You were acting.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.460
Yes. In preparation
for today's studies,

09:23.460 --> 09:25.680
I read Stanislavski's
<i>An Actor Prepares,</i>

09:25.680 --> 09:27.850
Stella Adler's
<i>The Technique of Acting,</i>

09:27.850 --> 09:29.420
Uta Hagen's
<i>Respect for Acting,</i>

09:29.420 --> 09:32.790
and Henry Winkler's
<i>Ayyy, I'm an Actor.</i>

09:32.790 --> 09:34.690
Well, good for you.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.640
Come on in.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.760
How shall we begin?

09:37.760 --> 09:39.460
Well, I thought we'd start

09:39.460 --> 09:41.930
with some
basic movement exercises.

09:41.930 --> 09:43.770
You know, get our bodies
warmed up a little.

09:43.770 --> 09:45.000
All right.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.170
So I just want you to relax

09:46.170 --> 09:48.040
and kind of
move around in the space.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.820
You know,
just do whatever feels natural.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.450
Sheldon?

09:59.450 --> 10:02.150
You said to do whatever
feels natural.

10:02.150 --> 10:04.090
This feels natural.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.120
Certainly more natural

10:06.120 --> 10:07.920
than what you're doing.

10:07.930 --> 10:09.190
Come on,
you got to work with me.

10:09.190 --> 10:10.930
We need to get connected
with our bodies.

10:10.930 --> 10:13.900
Penny, my body and I have
a relationship

10:13.900 --> 10:16.200
that works best
when we maintain a cool,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.300
wary distance from each other.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.940
All right,
let's just say we've warmed up.

10:22.940 --> 10:24.990
You're the "teacher."

10:26.710 --> 10:29.250
Okay. One of the things
that might help you

10:29.250 --> 10:30.550
in connecting with your students

10:30.550 --> 10:32.420
is being
a little more spontaneous.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.350
So why don't we
try some improvisation?

10:34.350 --> 10:35.750
Why not?
It seems like

10:35.750 --> 10:37.690
you're improvising
your entire curriculum.

10:40.210 --> 10:42.960
This is all about
listening and responding.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.930
Gotcha.

10:43.930 --> 10:45.160
I'm going to create a character

10:45.160 --> 10:46.880
and a situation, and you
just jump in when you feel it.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.380
All right.
All right.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.430
Action.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.970
Okay, it's not a movie.

10:53.970 --> 10:56.140
It's improv.
So no one calls "action."

10:56.140 --> 10:58.190
Hey, you taught me something.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.680
Who would have thought it?

11:02.860 --> 11:04.110
Okay.

11:04.110 --> 11:05.920
Uh, no, the shipment
has not arrived,

11:05.920 --> 11:07.520
and I really need those shoes.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.740
They are my biggest seller.

11:08.740 --> 11:10.500
Yes, ladies sizes six
through ten.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.890
Thank you.
Oh, sorry.

11:11.890 --> 11:14.320
I have to go.
I have a customer. Bye-bye.

11:14.330 --> 11:15.540
Hi. Can I help you?

11:15.540 --> 11:19.260
I'd like a frozen yogurt,
please.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.170
Yogurt?

11:23.170 --> 11:24.700
Yeah.
Um...

11:24.700 --> 11:25.970
Okay, sure.

11:25.970 --> 11:29.440
Luckily, we sell both shoes
and yogurt here.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.040
You do?

11:33.840 --> 11:35.550
Yes. Look up at the sign,

11:35.550 --> 11:38.380
and remember, improv is always
about saying yes.

11:38.380 --> 11:40.550
All right.

11:40.550 --> 11:42.740
Yes.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.690
I see a sign.

11:45.690 --> 11:49.430
It says "Camarillo State
Mental Hospital."

11:49.430 --> 11:52.200
What?

11:52.200 --> 11:54.800
It's the only explanation
I can come up with

11:54.800 --> 11:58.130
for why you think
you sell shoes and yogurt.

11:58.140 --> 11:59.540
Okay, you know what?

11:59.540 --> 12:01.370
Let's just try
a different improv. Uh..

12:01.370 --> 12:04.640
Oh, this time
we will be two winos

12:04.640 --> 12:06.410
living under a freeway overpass.

12:06.410 --> 12:08.580
Oh, and we're going
to use props?

12:08.580 --> 12:10.580
You bet.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.880
I had dreams,
you know.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.220
I was gonna be famous.

12:15.220 --> 12:17.600
Show everybody back home
I could be someone.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.560
Now look at me.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.560
Want some?

12:21.560 --> 12:24.390
You have any frozen yogurt?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.870
I'm still not adjusted

12:29.870 --> 12:32.540
to how the SyFy channel
spells their name now.

12:32.540 --> 12:36.170
S-y-F-y.
That's "siffy."

12:36.170 --> 12:38.170
Uh-huh.

12:41.910 --> 12:44.050
Hello?

12:45.550 --> 12:47.480
Oh, my God! Is he okay?

12:47.480 --> 12:49.390
What happened?
Hang on. Hang on.

12:49.390 --> 12:51.220
Uh-huh.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.760
Okay, thank you.

12:52.760 --> 12:56.190
Howard was on his scooter,
and got hit by a truck.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.190
He's in critical condition.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.400
Oh, no!

13:02.200 --> 13:03.370
Did you hear?

13:03.370 --> 13:05.280
Isn't it terrible?

13:05.290 --> 13:06.420
Have you seen him?

13:06.420 --> 13:07.700
They wouldn't let me in.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.640
Oh, my Howie.

13:10.640 --> 13:14.210
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.210
It'll be okay.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.210
It'll be
okay.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.080
It's Howard.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.990
Howard, hello.

13:24.990 --> 13:28.560
Raj, is that you?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.430
Yeah, I'm right here,
buddy. How are you?

13:30.430 --> 13:31.960
Shh, shh. Listen to me.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.500
I'm not gonna make it.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.000
No, no, no,
don't say that.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.600
You're going to
be all right.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.900
Raj, I don't have time.
Now, pay attention.

13:38.900 --> 13:43.910
My last wish is that
you look after Bernadette.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.110
Of course, of course.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.410
Now when you say "look
after," you mean...

13:50.410 --> 13:52.350
Sexually.

13:52.350 --> 13:55.720
Excuse me, Bernadette.
I have to hear it from him.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.520
Sexually.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.260
Got it. Take care.

14:01.790 --> 14:02.990
I guess I have no choice

14:02.990 --> 14:04.760
but to make sweet,
guilt-free love to you

14:04.760 --> 14:06.980
over and over again
for the rest of my life.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.100
That's how I heard it.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.210
Or it could be "sy-fee."

14:17.210 --> 14:18.410
What?

14:18.410 --> 14:21.110
S-y-F-y. "Sy-fee."

14:21.110 --> 14:22.710
Oh, right.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.910
Good one.

14:27.350 --> 14:29.490
So, did you get a chance
to go over the scene I gave you?

14:29.490 --> 14:31.670
Yes. I didn't care for it.

14:33.420 --> 14:37.630
Okay, <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>
is an American classic.

14:37.630 --> 14:38.900
So is the McRib sandwich.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.960
I don't care
for that, either.

14:43.470 --> 14:46.800
Fine. What would you rather do
as a scene study?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.440
I'm glad you asked.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.670
I took the liberty

14:49.670 --> 14:52.610
of adapting a <i>Star Trek</i>
fan fiction novella

14:52.610 --> 14:54.140
I wrote when I was ten

14:54.140 --> 14:55.950
into a one-act play.

14:55.950 --> 14:59.350
And you think it's better
than Tennessee Williams?

14:59.350 --> 15:03.350
Why don't we leave that for
future generations to decide?

15:03.350 --> 15:07.290
<i>Where No Sheldon</i>
<i>Has Gone Before.</i>

15:07.290 --> 15:11.160
It's the story of a young boy
who is transported

15:11.160 --> 15:13.730
from the ignorant backwoods
of East Texas

15:13.730 --> 15:15.260
to the 23rd Century,

15:15.270 --> 15:20.540
where his genius is not only
appreciated, but celebrated.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.760
KMN...

15:23.570 --> 15:25.890
Now, in this
pivotal scene,

15:25.890 --> 15:29.310
Sheldon's mother, played by you,
argues with an emissary

15:29.310 --> 15:32.210
of the United Federation
of Planets, Mr. Spock,

15:32.220 --> 15:34.850
the role I will bring to life.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.320
Okay, that's fine,
but let's try

15:37.320 --> 15:39.420
and get you out
of your comfort zone.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.260
Why would we want to do that?

15:41.260 --> 15:44.030
It's called "the comfort zone"
for a reason.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.200
Okay, the whole point of this is
to loosen you up a little,

15:47.200 --> 15:49.730
so I'm thinking you'll play
the role of your mother,

15:49.730 --> 15:51.970
and I will bring life
to Mr. Spock.

15:57.570 --> 15:59.080
I'm sorry.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.880
You'll be Spock?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.550
It's only logical.

16:06.350 --> 16:08.220
Very well.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.550
I'll set the scene.

16:09.550 --> 16:10.520
All right.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.520
"East Texas.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.810
"A warm summer night.

16:14.810 --> 16:16.340
"A woman, Mary,

16:16.340 --> 16:18.460
"stands on a porch.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.100
In the distance, we hear a
lonesome train whistle..."

16:23.470 --> 16:25.270
"The droning buzz of cicadas..""

16:26.950 --> 16:29.290
"A coyote howls at the moon,

16:29.290 --> 16:31.710
frightening sensitive young boys
everywhere."

16:33.040 --> 16:35.010
"Out in the woods,

16:35.010 --> 16:36.710
an owl screeches..."
Okay, okay.

16:36.710 --> 16:38.350
We get it.
You set the scene.

16:38.350 --> 16:40.420
Hoo!

16:41.450 --> 16:43.750
Now just read
your mother's line.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.920
"Shelly!

16:47.920 --> 16:50.460
"Shelly, how many times
have I told you

16:50.460 --> 16:53.730
"not to leave your sciencey
stuff out on the porch?

16:53.730 --> 16:55.430
"Goodness,

16:55.430 --> 16:57.900
"I'll never understand that boy.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.840
"But then again,
I'm a religious nut,

17:00.840 --> 17:04.940
and my mind is closed
to so many things."

17:08.700 --> 17:12.109
"Spock to <i>Enterprise.</i>
Transport successful."

17:12.119 --> 17:14.380
"Glory be to Heaven,

17:14.380 --> 17:18.089
"some sort of creature
just manifested out of thin air.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.520
"George, put down that Pepsi can
full of bourbon

17:20.520 --> 17:23.790
that ain't foolin' no one,
and get your shotgun!"

17:23.790 --> 17:26.050
"Greetings, Mary Cooper.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.300
I am Spock."

17:31.070 --> 17:33.050
I'm sorry.
I just don't buy it.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.140
Just keep going!

17:37.170 --> 17:41.440
"Oh, my, your sudden appearance
startles me."

17:41.450 --> 17:43.280
"We have been monitoring
your son Sheldon

17:43.280 --> 17:44.950
"from the 23rd Century, and

17:44.950 --> 17:46.720
"we have determined
that he is now ready

17:46.720 --> 17:47.980
"to join us.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.820
"His unique genius
is our best hope

17:49.820 --> 17:52.860
for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

17:52.860 --> 17:54.260
"I understand.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.360
"Oh, Shelly?

17:56.360 --> 17:58.960
"A man's here
to take you away to the future!

17:58.960 --> 18:00.830
Be sure to pack
clean underwear."

18:02.170 --> 18:04.300
Okay, okay, let's try
that last line again,

18:04.300 --> 18:06.170
and this time,
maybe try choking up

18:06.170 --> 18:07.770
a little.
Why?

18:07.770 --> 18:09.310
Well, you're losing your son.

18:09.310 --> 18:11.610
Yes, but he's going
to a better place

18:11.610 --> 18:14.840
where he won't get beat up...
so much.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.810
All right, come on,
just try it my way.

18:16.810 --> 18:18.380
Pretend you're sad
to see him go.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.770
I'm gonna lead you in.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.740
"His unique genius
is our best hope

18:22.740 --> 18:26.440
for bringing peace
to a vast and troubled galaxy."

18:27.660 --> 18:30.860
- That's your cue.
- I'm sorry. I just love that line.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.530
Even the way you do it.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.060
All right, come on, come on.

18:36.070 --> 18:37.420
Put some real emotion into it.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.200
Blah-blah, blah, blah...
"vast and troubled galaxy."

18:39.200 --> 18:40.600
Go.
Hmm.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.210
"Oh, Shelly?

18:43.210 --> 18:45.910
A man's here
to take you away to the future""

18:49.910 --> 18:52.650
"Be sure to pack clean
underwear."

18:52.650 --> 18:54.930
That's good. That's good.
That's good.

18:55.850 --> 18:58.390
Mommy, why are you crying?

18:58.390 --> 19:01.360
'Cause I'm gonna
miss you, Shelly-bean,

19:01.360 --> 19:04.930
even though you creep
the bugeeses out of me.

19:04.930 --> 19:06.810
Okay, I guess
we're improvising now.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.230
I'm sorry.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.700
It's not my fault.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.270
I'm just incredibly smart,

19:11.270 --> 19:14.770
and everyone around here is
dumber than a bag of rocks.

19:14.770 --> 19:16.640
Oh, now, don't
you start crying.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.120
You get in that spaceship.

19:18.130 --> 19:19.740
Mommy's late for
Indian bingo.

19:23.410 --> 19:25.110
Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.120
Yeah, I think I broke your son.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.380
Hey, hold on.

19:28.390 --> 19:29.520
Talk to your mother.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.390
Mommy, I love you.

19:32.390 --> 19:34.890
Don't let Spock take
me to the future!

19:42.450 --> 19:43.180
Okay, Raj,

19:43.240 --> 19:45.840
I know you've been avoiding me
and Howard, and I'm not leaving

19:45.840 --> 19:47.370
until you tell me
what's going on

19:47.370 --> 19:48.780
inside that little head
of yours.
