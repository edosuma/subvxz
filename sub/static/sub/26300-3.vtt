WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:03.269
So this is what happened
last time on Star...

00:03.270 --> 00:04.820
- Where you been, man?
- I'm in some trouble.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.316
It ain't even about the money no more.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.240
You're the only loose end to the shoot.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.270
I was talking to the cop.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.750
They said we need to do a rape kit.

00:10.780 --> 00:12.979
- All we need is a hot artist.
- I want one of Lottie's.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.799
I know your contract's
coming up for renegotiation.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.300
We ain't got no business, bro. We done.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.060
Bianca, she was sitting next to me.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.600
I've snuck a few of your joints before.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.960
Helps with my PTSD.

00:20.990 --> 00:22.340
Jayden drew Jahil.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.940
Jahil's murderer is still out there.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.900
I won't let your daddy's
death be in vain.

00:25.930 --> 00:28.180
I've been living in my car
till it broke down, son.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.600
- Who is the baby's daddy?
- Congrats.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.399
If Cotton knew what you did,

00:32.400 --> 00:33.656
she'd hate you even more than I do.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.199
Oh, bitch, I've just begun.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.920
I'm in business with Maurice Jetter.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
Like I told Maurice, I'm not
doing nothing without Carlotta.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.159
I can link y'all up with my boy, Andy.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.170
Andy?

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.640 --> 00:55.080
You better know that school
work like you know them songs.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.000
See, that's what my Grandma
Minnie would say to me

00:57.010 --> 00:58.810
when I would stay up all night singing,

00:58.880 --> 01:00.960
and when Stevie came out with
Songs in the Key of Life,

01:00.980 --> 01:03.150
my mother wore the grooves
out on that record.

01:03.180 --> 01:06.090
This music thing, it's just in my blood.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.520
And you plan to continue that
passion at Gravity Records?

01:08.560 --> 01:10.520
I just spent the last month negotiating

01:10.560 --> 01:13.190
a major deal with Karma nightclub.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.360
My artists will perform there weekly

01:15.400 --> 01:17.830
and we'll livestream it
so the fans can watch.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.900
Now show me a label
making moves like this.

01:19.930 --> 01:21.270
You really are a game changer.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.740
Listen, my grandmother also said,

01:26.770 --> 01:29.780
"Don't let your mouth write a
check that your ass can't cash."

01:29.820 --> 01:31.780
My ass can cash this one.

01:34.150 --> 01:36.520
I got some business to handle.

01:36.540 --> 01:37.866
You mind if we finish this up later?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.700
Of course, I need to
grab some B-roll anyway.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.320
All right. Thanks, guys.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.660
Hey, long time.

01:47.060 --> 01:49.460
Interview was supposed to
be about Gravity Media.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.160
Are you still tripping because

01:51.180 --> 01:52.940
I released Take 3's song
without telling you?

01:52.970 --> 01:54.950
No, you see, I'm tripping
because you're trying to make

01:54.970 --> 01:56.970
Gravity Media's deal
with Karma about you.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.359
It bugs you that if it's a hit,

01:58.360 --> 01:59.809
it'll be my victory, not yours.

01:59.810 --> 02:02.210
And if it fails, it's all on you.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.480
What would Grandma say to that?

02:13.280 --> 02:14.550
Come on, man.

02:14.590 --> 02:18.090
I know you are not cooking
that swine in my Guccis.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.290
And you got grease on my contract, man.

02:21.330 --> 02:24.030
Yeah, I read it. How come
you ain't signed it yet?

02:24.060 --> 02:25.900
Pops, you ain't been
here but a month, bro.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.210
That movie deal in your contract,

02:27.230 --> 02:30.300
that's gonna keep you
away from your music.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.200
This is coming from the
man living on my couch.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.539
And this is coming from the boy

02:33.540 --> 02:35.540
who almost jumped off a ledge.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.060
I ain't raise you like that.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.790
And I'm supposed to
listen to your gay ass?

02:39.580 --> 02:41.910
My gay ass could still break
you down like a fraction.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.840
You ain't that grown.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.250
Neither are you, Bobby.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.550
Xander, baby,

02:51.560 --> 02:53.730
you gonna be able to come
to the club opening?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.160
I gotta work.

02:56.680 --> 03:00.530
I want you to see what you
paid for and me in action.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.200
Look, I've had to do so much

03:02.220 --> 03:04.170
to prove myself to my family.

03:04.210 --> 03:06.640
When I open the doors to that club,

03:06.670 --> 03:08.680
they're gonna see who I really am.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.110
No more street hustle. No
more blood on my hands.

03:11.180 --> 03:13.450
- I'm gonna be legit.
- Okay, babe.

03:26.190 --> 03:28.690
Damn.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.230
Yo. Sorry.

03:34.270 --> 03:37.300
What the hell you mean you
can't find that munchkin?

03:37.540 --> 03:39.340
You better hire somebody who can.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.910
Now, as sexy as that sounded,

03:44.950 --> 03:47.720
that doesn't sound like a
woman going legit to me.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.059
I got just one loose end to tie up,

03:50.060 --> 03:51.249
then I'm Mother Teresa.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.820
Uh-huh.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.900
How much y'all think
Carlotta spent on that?

04:45.960 --> 04:48.220
Child, you know this is the
biggest move she done made yet

04:48.240 --> 04:49.939
since Midtown became Gravity Records

04:49.940 --> 04:52.240
with this Karma launch, so
you know it wasn't nothing

04:52.280 --> 04:53.680
for that bitch to call in a favor.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.450
And y'all got rehearsal
today at, uh, noon.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.490
Like, now?

04:57.500 --> 04:59.420
- Noon, girl.
- That's, like, now.

04:59.450 --> 05:01.400
Okay, well, then there
you go. Go get ready.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.539
Simone, Mateo needs you
to stop by his office.

05:03.540 --> 05:04.550
Okay.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.730
Did you get the travel
handled that I asked for?

05:08.760 --> 05:11.180
I just need everything right for Olivia.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.000
Why you so worried about that girl?

05:13.030 --> 05:15.670
Her sister, Bianca,
died in the plane crash

05:15.700 --> 05:17.440
and she reached out to me online.

05:17.470 --> 05:18.600
Oh, no, that's too deep.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.756
Please don't bring that to me.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.456
- I can't.
- Star, your baby daddy's here.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.550
Ooh, girl, Jackson here?

05:23.580 --> 05:26.439
Come on, Star. Y'all gonna
have some cute babies.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.820
I'm gonna go get me a banana.

05:27.860 --> 05:28.980
What up, Magic Mike?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.220
What up, Cardi B?

05:32.140 --> 05:33.520
- What's up?
- Don't you think

05:33.540 --> 05:34.796
you've been working a
little too hard lately?

05:34.820 --> 05:36.800
You monitoring how much I work?

05:36.820 --> 05:39.090
No, I'm looking out for you.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.806
I promise you, I'm gonna
be here for this baby.

05:40.830 --> 05:43.600
Okay, look, I told you about the baby

05:43.630 --> 05:45.820
'cause I think you deserve to know,

05:45.960 --> 05:48.300
not 'cause I need you,
I got this right now.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.070
Listen, I know you can handle anything

05:50.100 --> 05:51.670
'cause you handled me.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.870
I got you.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.140
Anybody ever told you you're ugly?

05:59.180 --> 06:02.840
- Have they?
- No.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.450
You're kind of ugly.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.360
I never thought about it till right now.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.420
- You look great.
- Mm-hmm.

06:12.930 --> 06:15.320
So, as I was saying before,

06:15.500 --> 06:17.040
my vision for Gravity Media...

06:17.100 --> 06:19.900
You don't have the juice. Carlotta does.

06:19.930 --> 06:23.120
Sorry, Mateo.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.740
I seem to remember you

06:24.770 --> 06:27.640
needing me to navigate every
social circle on campus.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.139
You always were charming.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.640
No, mami.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.480
I was always smart.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.180
A poor kid from Cuba scrapped his way up

06:36.220 --> 06:38.900
and became one of the top
student at Duke University.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.520
You all laughed at me at first.

06:40.550 --> 06:43.280
- We didn't laugh.
- Not to my face, but you all did.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.390
I failed my first time out the gate,

06:46.430 --> 06:49.260
but Gravity Media is different,
and you should be writing

06:49.270 --> 06:51.730
about me, not about Carlotta.

06:51.770 --> 06:55.600
Maybe I could see the story differently

06:55.640 --> 06:59.480
if there were something in it for me.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.610
For old times' sake.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.300
Simone!

07:25.330 --> 07:28.900
Hey, have you seen Mateo?

07:28.940 --> 07:30.280
Oh, I get it, you're still in shock.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.340
Listen, I went to bat for you
because I believe in you.

07:32.350 --> 07:34.279
Of course we're gonna need to
get you an acting coach...

07:34.280 --> 07:36.240
Wait, what are you talking about?

07:36.280 --> 07:38.160
You're starring in the movie with Noah.

07:38.180 --> 07:41.510
You convinced us. Congrats.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.160
Hi!

07:56.200 --> 07:59.430
- Hi.
- This is not happening!

07:59.470 --> 08:01.930
- This is crazy. A G-Wagen?
- Yeah.

08:01.970 --> 08:04.400
And you are so fly, like, stupid fly.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.446
- Thank you.
- Not stupid, but you know what I mean.

08:06.470 --> 08:07.720
Ugh, you probably hate me already.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.840
What? No, no way. I'm
just glad you're here.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.599
Come on. I'll show you Gravity Records.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.720
Girl, I almost freaked the hell
out when I saw that was you

08:15.740 --> 08:17.860
that posted on Bianca's SnapShots page.

08:17.890 --> 08:21.950
And thanks for sending a car.

08:21.990 --> 08:23.660
I really hate flying ever since...

08:23.690 --> 08:25.360
Oh, trust me,

08:25.390 --> 08:27.090
girl, it's okay, I understand.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.800
Alex Crane just called me "girl."

08:28.840 --> 08:31.160
This is the best day of my life.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.630
You're much smaller in person.

08:33.669 --> 08:36.200
You're a lot smaller in person.

08:37.570 --> 08:41.010
Um, I've heard that before.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.909
Come on. Let's go.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.616
I'm calling it Gravity Night at Karma.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.580
You go on before the girls,
so you will set the tone.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.500
How you like the space?

08:49.550 --> 08:52.880
It's dope, but I, um,
I've been here before.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.250
Welcome back, Noah.

08:54.290 --> 08:56.590
I told you this club was gonna be fire.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.890
The hell are you doing here?

08:57.930 --> 08:59.660
I own the club. That's right.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.490
You signed a contract to work with me.

09:01.530 --> 09:03.360
I negotiated through
my investor's company.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.800
Where the hell you get an investor from?

09:05.830 --> 09:07.346
And what you mean you've
been here before?

09:07.370 --> 09:09.870
Lottie, everybody knows my
contract is about to be up.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.600
And I tried to sign him.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.980
Maurice and I have a streaming deal.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.010
See, this ain't just a club.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.140
Yeah.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.510
This is...

09:20.450 --> 09:24.550
You have no experience,
you have no track record,

09:24.590 --> 09:25.680
no connections.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.050
Noah's career is not a game, Cassie.

09:28.090 --> 09:29.920
But I got you scared, though, right?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.860
Karma Sound might be small,

09:31.890 --> 09:34.500
but at least you'll get to own
your own music and brand.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.900
Big labels like Gravity Records,

09:35.920 --> 09:37.530
they all about keeping you boxed in.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.830
You must be smoking what you selling.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.100
Gravity Media has done nothing

09:41.120 --> 09:42.780
but give you a future, endorsements,

09:42.800 --> 09:44.870
movie deals, tours, not to mention

09:44.910 --> 09:47.210
a label head that you
can actually trust.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.380
Carlotta, the last time

09:48.400 --> 09:50.680
I negotiated, your legal
team pushed back.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.880
All right, I read my contract.
I deserve more.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.390
- Mm-hmm.
- Especially creative control

09:54.400 --> 09:55.400
over my next album.

09:55.410 --> 09:58.420
Noah, I've been down with you
since before you were sober,

09:58.450 --> 10:01.050
way before I was the head of this label.

10:01.090 --> 10:02.490
You know I'm-a look out.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.390
We all know you can't trust
the lookout on a plantation.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.160
Look,

10:08.200 --> 10:11.860
I just need space to
think about all of this.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.720
Do you, baby.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.260
Guess who's coming up in the world.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.970
It's your girl!

10:19.010 --> 10:21.710
You ain't nothing but
a street trick, Cas.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.210
And you ain't gonna win this war.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.340
I promise you that.

10:28.550 --> 10:30.880
But don't you like the name of the club?

10:30.920 --> 10:33.300
Karma is a bitch, sis.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.080
Now you want to pull
out of the Karma deal?

10:39.130 --> 10:40.419
Just so you know, there's another team

10:40.420 --> 10:41.560
trying to poach Noah.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.650
Send me Noah's deal points,
I'll keep him happy.

10:43.670 --> 10:45.860
Just make sure tomorrow
night is a success.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.470
Yeah, okay. You're late.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.740
I know, I-I had to stop
by my parents' crib.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.640
I know I can't talk to them,
but I had to see them.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.940
Look, I know this is tough,
but you leaving town

10:55.960 --> 10:58.750
is the only way to keep you
safe, just stay gone this time.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.320
I will.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.850
Carlotta, I'm really
sorry about Jahil...

11:03.920 --> 11:05.890
Don't.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.920
It's not gonna change anything.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.620
You just worry about staying safe.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.870
You haven't let him
off the hook about me.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.610
He feels guilty.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.610
I'm helping him. That's enough.

11:28.650 --> 11:33.420
Besides, I got to deal
with this Cassie mess.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.650
She got somebody bankrolling her.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.290
You know your baby sister
ain't got but one person

11:39.320 --> 11:41.590
who'll give her stacks like that.

11:41.630 --> 11:44.130
The problem is, what is
he gonna want in return?

11:44.200 --> 11:47.460
Exactly. Stupid ass.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.940
You plan to be late every
rehearsal or just some?

11:54.970 --> 11:57.340
This Karma thing is important.
It's streaming live.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.480
Star, I'm here, okay? Damn.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.010
Damn, I was just playing,
but are you okay?

12:02.050 --> 12:03.980
I got the lead in the movie.

12:04.070 --> 12:06.700
You got the lead in the movie?

12:06.740 --> 12:09.100
That's amazing. Why
are you acting weird?

12:09.140 --> 12:11.970
I don't know, it's
just a lot to take in.

12:12.010 --> 12:13.440
Yeah, it's a lot to take in.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.839
Of course it's a lot to take in.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.840
You might be a movie star.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.180
I can't believe they're
gonna fit your big-ass head

12:19.200 --> 12:20.299
onto those screens.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.160
- Shut up, Star.
- I'm just playing. I'm just playing.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.400
- You should be excited.
- Okay, you're right. Okay, damn.

12:24.420 --> 12:27.920
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.460
But you're not a movie star
yet, so pick up these moves.

12:31.490 --> 12:33.830
- You remember?
- Okay.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.500
- He's kicking.
- The baby?

12:38.530 --> 12:42.040
- Can I feel?
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.040
He's, like, doing the keke.

12:49.780 --> 12:50.910
Wow.

12:50.980 --> 12:55.180
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.950
I wish you were at the first ultrasound.

12:56.990 --> 12:59.590
It was cool.

12:59.620 --> 13:02.520
Look, Star, I'm sorry
that I wasn't there.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.960
I don't know what it's like
to be pregnant, and you...

13:04.990 --> 13:06.470
You always act so tough, you know?

13:06.500 --> 13:08.440
You act like you don't need nobody.

13:08.460 --> 13:10.460
I know.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.470
That's on me.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.470
But I'm really gonna try.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.400
I'm really gonna try to give this kid

13:17.420 --> 13:18.720
everything we never had.

13:18.740 --> 13:22.140
A strong mama, a daddy, an auntie.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.520
Maybe even a granddaddy.

13:26.010 --> 13:29.080
I was thinking of looking for Brody.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.520
Even though he messed us up,
it's not about us anymore.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.190
We're grown, but we could give
this little nugget a family.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.760
Yeah, a dysfunctional one.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.090
We have no other option.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.790
Well, let's find his ass, then.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.830
By the way, please take
anything you want.

13:44.870 --> 13:47.300
'Cause you gotta come through
drippin' at the Karma opening.

13:47.340 --> 13:48.970
You're so generous.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.370
It's been hard lately. Me
and Bianca were, like,

13:52.410 --> 13:54.240
best friends.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.180
I miss her so much.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.480
My mom cries every night.

13:58.510 --> 14:00.610
I can never talk about it.

14:00.650 --> 14:02.620
I can't really talk about it, either.

14:04.950 --> 14:08.040
Well, I'm no life coach,

14:08.060 --> 14:10.690
but I can listen.

14:10.730 --> 14:12.880
After the hit...

14:14.660 --> 14:19.500
all I could hear was this ringing.

14:19.530 --> 14:22.800
People screaming.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.440
There was a girl next to me, bleeding,

14:26.580 --> 14:30.380
but the EMTs took me first.

14:30.410 --> 14:33.080
Because you're Alex Crane.

14:33.110 --> 14:36.420
The girl sitting next to me was Bianca.

14:36.450 --> 14:41.990
She, um, held my hand before she died.

14:42.020 --> 14:45.120
And she kept telling me it was okay.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.960
And you brought me here for what?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.300
To make yourself feel better?

14:53.340 --> 14:56.570
- No, Olivia, I...
- No, don't touch me!

14:56.610 --> 14:58.840
My sister is dead 'cause of you.

15:10.220 --> 15:13.250
That's just the kids, Grandma.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.060
It's okay.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.380
Y'all stop playing in my damn garden!

15:20.400 --> 15:23.060
Grandma, it's okay.

15:24.900 --> 15:30.240
All I can see is his face...
looking at me.

15:31.770 --> 15:34.810
And that gun to my head.

15:36.310 --> 15:41.250
Every time I close my
eyes, I see his face.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.980
I hear his breath.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.120
You remember anything else?

15:53.680 --> 15:56.400
He had a brand.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.280
On his shoulder.

16:00.570 --> 16:03.700
I should have killed his ass.

16:05.870 --> 16:08.440
Oh, my God.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.650
What is you doing?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.320
This ain't even that
type of neighborhood.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.899
Is that meat on my grill?

16:16.900 --> 16:18.720
This is how you get to
meet your neighbors.

16:24.060 --> 16:26.460
Don't say nothing crazy, all right?

16:26.500 --> 16:29.160
- Mr. Brooks.
- What's up, Mateo?

16:29.200 --> 16:32.100
Heard you were considering your options.

16:32.130 --> 16:35.520
There's only one, brother.
Gravity Media.

16:38.270 --> 16:39.900
I got a new contract for you.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.940
Uh, hold up.

16:43.980 --> 16:46.380
Carlotta said I'd have creative
control over my third album.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.656
We'll talk about that after we get

16:47.680 --> 16:49.650
this music night up and running.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.250
With you as the headliner, of course.

16:52.290 --> 16:53.790
I hope we have a deal.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.380
Enjoy.

16:57.890 --> 17:01.290
He might as well have
given you tap shoes, boy.

17:04.869 --> 17:07.300
No matter how clean you
get, I can still smell

17:07.319 --> 17:09.700
that dirty money just
dripping off your ass.

17:09.740 --> 17:14.710
Carlotta Brown.

17:14.740 --> 17:17.480
Long time.

17:17.510 --> 17:19.680
How's your mama?

17:21.220 --> 17:23.520
Look, I know you're plotting
with my sister again.

17:23.550 --> 17:26.550
That's your coin funding her club.

17:26.589 --> 17:29.920
As fond as I am of your sister...

17:31.630 --> 17:33.330
... those days are dead and gone.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.960
Your jungle fever ass left her

17:35.000 --> 17:37.330
as soon as you pretended
to go legit. Remember?

17:37.370 --> 17:39.530
But now you're messing with my money,

17:39.570 --> 17:42.030
And you can't play me
like you play my sister.

17:42.070 --> 17:44.370
I got my business tied up in that club,

17:44.410 --> 17:46.370
so if I find out that you dirty,

17:46.410 --> 17:50.010
I'm gonna call the cops
on you so fast, boy,

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
you gonna think I was a white woman.

17:54.950 --> 17:58.880
That's a lie. You ain't a snitch.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.160
I don't pull pistols no more, either,

18:04.190 --> 18:06.730
but I'm sure I could come
up with an alternative.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.180
Hey, Carter, get the lady a drink.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.280
She needs it.

18:21.020 --> 18:25.000
Jayden. Get him. Cotton,
he got my phone.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.520
See, Cotton not a real black mama yet.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.680
Yeah, that's what it mean, Pat.

18:29.710 --> 18:31.360
A real black mama would
have her foot stuck

18:31.380 --> 18:32.836
up in his ass.

18:32.860 --> 18:35.120
You see my leg twitching?

18:35.150 --> 18:37.180
I'm gonna break my foot
off in that kid ass.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.850
You a damn fool.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.020
Yo, so I put some feelers out for Brody.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.460
The police are gonna call me
if he's in any of the jails.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.960
- Dysfunctional.
- Super white trash.

18:46.980 --> 18:49.040
Auntie Cassie is in the house.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.470
Where's my little apple-headed nephew?

18:51.500 --> 18:52.970
Auntie Cassie.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.200
Ooh, happy birthday, Jay-Jay.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.940
Oh, so big of a hug!

18:58.980 --> 19:00.780
I invited Auntie Cassie.

19:00.810 --> 19:03.440
I get it. That's your family.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.210
But she's also helping me with Jahil.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.740
And I know you don't understand,

19:06.780 --> 19:08.620
but I want her in my life, Mama.

19:08.650 --> 19:11.050
Cotton, listen, she...

19:11.090 --> 19:12.820
Jayden!

19:12.860 --> 19:14.750
You better hope this phone works, boy.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.076
- I didn't do nothing.
- Don't lie to me.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.740
- Yes, you did. You know you did.
- Mama...

19:17.760 --> 19:18.936
No, I told you to get that boy.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.840
If he erased one of these
voice mails on here,

19:20.860 --> 19:22.340
I'm gonna have his narrow behind.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.380
That's a start.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.730
What the hell is wrong with you?

19:24.770 --> 19:26.230
What the hell is wrong with you?

19:26.270 --> 19:28.540
I figured out who your investor is.

19:28.570 --> 19:30.440
Xander? Really, Cas?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.320
Don't act like you ain't
hustled with the both of us.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.220
I know if X does something for you,

19:34.240 --> 19:35.486
he gonna want something in return.

19:35.510 --> 19:38.110
He about to drag your dumb
ass from sewer to gutter.

19:38.150 --> 19:40.570
And you need to drag your
ass back to your lane

19:40.600 --> 19:42.220
and stay in it, okay.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.450
Worry about Noah instead
of me and my damn man.

19:44.490 --> 19:46.036
How is that your man when he has a wife?

19:46.060 --> 19:48.320
How was you fornicating with a pastor?

19:50.560 --> 19:53.030
You know what, I almost feel
sorry for your dumb ass.

19:53.060 --> 19:54.100
You just a bottom feeder.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.660
I'm rising to the top, Carlotta,

19:55.700 --> 19:58.030
and I don't need your pity at all.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.800
What you need is some common sense.

19:59.820 --> 20:02.270
- And a reality check.
- And a reality show, bitch.

20:02.310 --> 20:06.610
It's already on. It's called
Catfish, bottom feeder!

20:08.810 --> 20:09.840
Hi.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.950
Thanks for calling.

20:11.980 --> 20:14.750
Um, I figured you'd never
want to talk to me again.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.920
It was a lot to take in.

20:16.950 --> 20:20.890
I'm sorry.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.300
Is-Is that you?

20:23.340 --> 20:25.790
That sounds like you.

20:25.830 --> 20:28.300
- That's beautiful.
- After Bianca died,

20:28.330 --> 20:31.140
I started singing more.

20:34.170 --> 20:37.870
She used to joke that one day I could be

20:37.910 --> 20:40.980
on this big stage somewhere, like you.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.840
Crazy, right?

20:42.900 --> 20:45.480
No. No, that's not crazy.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.520
What if I can make that dream come true?

20:51.550 --> 20:54.190
I know I can't bring Bianca back,

20:54.220 --> 20:58.490
but I could write or
produce a song for you.

20:58.530 --> 21:00.130
You don't have to do that.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.930
But I want to.

21:01.960 --> 21:05.520
Please... let me.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.090
Okay.

21:09.110 --> 21:11.370
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.880
Looks clean as hell, bro.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.010
Funny seeing you here.

21:20.050 --> 21:23.780
It'd be even funnier if
it was a coincidence.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.190
Listen, I know you don't trust me,

21:25.220 --> 21:27.160
but quitting's not in my DNA.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.420
I used to play safety for Tech.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.790
We were down by six one
game, 30 seconds to go.

21:32.830 --> 21:35.860
I pick off the QB, score, and we won.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.000
Another one of your
war stories, Maurice?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.930
I don't ever give up, Noah.

21:39.970 --> 21:42.740
Sign with us, and you can
build your own kingdom.

21:42.770 --> 21:46.070
He's already the king
of Gravity Records.

21:46.110 --> 21:47.410
I heard Mateo came by.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.900
Yeah, he said that we could

21:48.910 --> 21:50.780
talk about creative
control after this album.

21:50.860 --> 21:51.860
I'm-a tell you right now,

21:51.861 --> 21:53.119
- that ain't gonna work.
- I agree.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.820
Nobody knows your taste like I do.

21:54.850 --> 21:56.950
Trust me, I will make
sure your voice is heard.

21:56.990 --> 21:58.966
As a matter of fact, after
this album, I think you need

21:58.990 --> 22:01.070
your own imprint; you need to
be signing your own artists,

22:01.090 --> 22:02.760
creating your own sound, maybe even...

22:02.790 --> 22:05.430
All I hear is a bunch of
"maybes" and "next times."

22:05.460 --> 22:08.000
My maybes and next times come
with a proven track record.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.530
What you got?

22:13.240 --> 22:15.140
I'm riding with you, Carlotta.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.920
Till the wheels fall off.

22:28.050 --> 22:30.540
You're in here reminiscing?

22:30.580 --> 22:32.480
Yeah.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.960
Man, you used to love it
when I sang The Temptations.

22:34.990 --> 22:36.960
- Oh, oh.
- Yeah. You remember

22:36.980 --> 22:38.636
when you caught me listening
to George Michael?

22:38.660 --> 22:41.060
You said, "Boy, let me
show you some real soul."

22:41.100 --> 22:43.260
Hell yes, I did.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.430
You did.

22:44.470 --> 22:46.630
I, um...

22:46.670 --> 22:49.960
I decided to sign with Gravity Records.

22:51.640 --> 22:56.210
But you, you used to talk about
real freedom as an artist.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.980
Don't lose your soul chasing
no carrot, you hear me?

22:59.020 --> 23:00.980
- Yeah.
- All right.

23:01.020 --> 23:02.280
That's all I'm-a say.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.620
No, it ain't.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.880
Hey, man, look, I'm-a get up out
your hair in a minute, man,

23:09.900 --> 23:12.460
all right? I found a
place to stay, so...

23:12.500 --> 23:14.060
All I need to do now is, uh,

23:14.100 --> 23:16.630
figure out how to make some money.

23:19.980 --> 23:22.240
And that's where I come in, right?

23:22.310 --> 23:24.570
Hey.

23:24.610 --> 23:26.800
I ain't no freeloader, boy.
I'm-I'm-a pay you back.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.420
You know, how-how much I got
to pay you to leave me again?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.610
Hmm? What you want? $100?

23:31.650 --> 23:34.380
What you need, a G? Take
it all, whatever you want.

23:34.420 --> 23:36.659
Hey, you better show me
some damn respect, boy.

23:36.660 --> 23:40.220
Why? Huh? You left me
like I was nothing.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.320
What, I wasn't good
enough for you back then?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.520
You know what? Get out my house.

23:48.130 --> 23:50.130
All right, you ready?

23:52.100 --> 23:54.070
Think I'm gonna stay a little longer.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.000
Yeah.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.060
You ain't nothing but
a street trick, Cas.

Excuse me.

26:24.860 --> 26:27.020
So, how we doing with that contract?

26:27.060 --> 26:28.940
We shook hands on it. It's all good.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.670
We need this night to be perfect.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.000
Every investor is watching.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.820
I don't write checks I can't cash.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.810
Carlotta, I was wondering if we
could finish the interview now.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.180
Sure.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.450
Detective Batista?

26:49.050 --> 26:50.620
Where?

26:50.660 --> 26:52.790
Okay, I'm on my way.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.620
It's Brody. We got to go.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.200
Star, we can't just leave.

26:57.330 --> 26:58.500
No.

26:58.530 --> 27:00.660
Y'all, we have to perform.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.100
Hey, I want to talk.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.610
I got it.

27:12.950 --> 27:14.580
All right.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.580
Hey, look, man.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.740
It's hard enough, you know,
for a black man to feel deep

27:24.780 --> 27:28.680
in this world without, you
know, being seen as weak.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.560
You know, then, try being a gay
black man and see if that,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.940
that load is any easier to carry.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.500
When I left you and your mama,

27:40.540 --> 27:42.900
hey, man, I was fighting
something deep inside, man.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.659
I didn't, I didn't think
about what it was gonna

27:44.660 --> 27:47.080
do to you, man. I-I
didn't think about that.

27:47.110 --> 27:51.210
But, you know... hey, man,
I was wrong for that.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.300
Is that supposed to be
some kind of apology?

27:57.560 --> 27:59.540
I saw your "Dance with
My Father" performance.

28:03.530 --> 28:06.330
Me and Paul watched that on a loop.

28:09.430 --> 28:14.070
So the reason I'm living in
my car is 'cause Paul died.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.670
And, uh, uh, you know,

28:16.680 --> 28:19.180
I didn't have no rights
to our life, so...

28:19.340 --> 28:21.340
I lost him,

28:21.680 --> 28:24.380
then I promised him that I
would come and I'd find you

28:24.420 --> 28:26.480
and I was gonna make it right.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.550
Then I...

28:27.570 --> 28:29.380
That's when you found me on the roof?

28:29.420 --> 28:32.090
Look. Listen to me.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.240
It took me my whole life
to figure out who I was.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.519
But you, boy, you came out

28:37.520 --> 28:39.459
your mama marching to your own beat.

28:39.460 --> 28:42.430
You know what I'm saying?

28:42.470 --> 28:44.480
Hey, I want you to remember:

28:44.580 --> 28:48.200
whatever you do in this
world, whatever you do,

28:48.240 --> 28:53.210
remember, it ain't about
the fame, all right?

28:53.240 --> 28:55.400
It's about the freedom.

29:01.450 --> 29:04.020
All right.

29:04.060 --> 29:06.000
Hey, Pop.

29:09.590 --> 29:11.480
How I look?

29:13.430 --> 29:15.840
Man, you look great, son.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.680
You look great.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.740
Testing, testing.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.110
What's up, y'all? My name
is Cassie, and I want

29:31.160 --> 29:34.150
to welcome you guys to me and
Maurice Jetter's new spot,

29:34.190 --> 29:37.590
Karma, where the booties are
tight and the songs are right.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.190
Now, some people thought we
couldn't do it, but we're here

29:40.230 --> 29:42.790
and we ain't going nowhere.

29:42.930 --> 29:44.660
Now I want y'all to give it up

29:44.700 --> 29:48.979
for the one and the only sexy
chocolate, Mr. Noah Brooks.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.740
Has Noah Brooks re-upped his contract?

29:52.770 --> 29:54.520
There were rumors he might leave.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.470
And that's all they were, were rumors.

29:56.510 --> 29:59.020
Nothing can compare to Gravity Records.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.510
Noah knows that.

30:00.550 --> 30:03.180
What's up, what's up, y'all?

30:03.220 --> 30:05.200
I want to thank y'all for
having me here tonight.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.200
I'm-I'm really grateful to be here.

and you've been such a good friend to me

37:52.150 --> 37:53.580
So tell me.

I know Brody wasn't your father,
but y'all was close enough.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.660

38:58.780 --> 39:00.550
1994? Something like that.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.080
Back when you couldn't ask or tell.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.930
Man, only thing we were doing back then

39:03.940 --> 39:05.220
was running and telling Luther.

better get home, Simone.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.220
Okay.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.730

39:20.640 --> 39:21.946

39:21.970 --> 39:24.400

39:24.440 --> 39:28.340
about Bianca, the plane.

39:28.380 --> 39:31.940
Now, I obviously can't bring
her sister back, but...

39:31.980 --> 39:34.780
I don't know. Maybe I can
get her a record deal.

39:34.820 --> 39:36.320
Baby, are you okay?

39:36.350 --> 39:38.450

40:19.060 --> 40:22.340

40:26.120 --> 40:29.200
- and I can't.
- You can.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.400
