WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.920
-How's he doing?
-Not so good.

00:03.253 --> 00:04.671
<i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:05.130 --> 00:06.381
[tires screech]

00:09.676 --> 00:10.719
How is he?

00:10.802 --> 00:12.679
-We have to save him!
-I know what you're thinking.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.431
-I have to try!
-Lucy, don't.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.352
Do these have something
to do with you aging?

00:18.435 --> 00:22.147
I promised Addy
that we'd all stick together.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.354
[crying] Lucy...

01:11.446 --> 01:12.698
I'm sorry.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.637
We all loved you, Lucy.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.558
From the moment you clawed
your way into this world,

01:39.975 --> 01:41.059
we knew...

01:41.935 --> 01:42.978
you were special.

01:45.731 --> 01:50.235
As you wove your way
in and out of our journey

01:52.029 --> 01:55.365
in this big ole world
of hurt and darkness,

01:55.782 --> 01:57.367
you were the bright spot.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.121
Freaky little blue bright spot.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.794
And in your short time here,

02:09.379 --> 02:11.131
you damn near saved the world.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.930
So as another doctor once said,

02:20.974 --> 02:23.602
"Let's not cry because she's gone.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.943
But let us smile 'cause she was here."

03:26.206 --> 03:27.958
[snarling]

04:02.701 --> 04:03.535
Why are we stopping?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.247
This stuff stinks. What is that?

04:07.330 --> 04:11.001
Smells like rancid french fries
or zombie fish sticks.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.210
You getting hungry?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.504
Or Murphy's sock soup or...

04:15.297 --> 04:17.340
Close. Old kitchen grease.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.178
Modified diesel running on
bio fuel. Lucky to have it.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.932
A lot more grease traps than gas stations.
Let me see what's happening.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.151
[snarling]

04:36.234 --> 04:37.360
We got company.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.708
Let him go.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
He's got some things to work out.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.338
[woman screaming] Stop! Stop!

05:38.922 --> 05:41.132
Help! Stop!

05:41.341 --> 05:42.842
-[woman] Get back!
-What is that?

05:44.135 --> 05:44.970
Keep going!

05:47.180 --> 05:48.765
-[woman] Help!
-No. Stop!

05:54.354 --> 05:55.564
[woman] Somebody help me!

06:01.027 --> 06:02.529
Aren't you the one that always says
never get out of the boat?

06:02.737 --> 06:04.781
I'm getting out of the boat.
I'm killing some bad guys.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.699
Who's coming with?

06:06.950 --> 06:07.784
Hey, hey, hey.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.537
Let me check it out first, all right?

06:10.704 --> 06:14.040
Don't do this in the headspace you're in.
Nothing good can come of it.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.084
Nothing good comes of anything.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.893
Well what in the hell do we have here?
The world's saddest carnival?

06:34.102 --> 06:37.272
Mad Zs. Four. No, five.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.401
-Any humans?
-Up there.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.694
[growling]

06:43.570 --> 06:44.654
Alive or Z?

06:45.655 --> 06:46.656
Can't tell.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.243
Now who would do that to a woman?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.954
I tell you, it's not the zombies
that make the Apocalypse suck.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.080
It's the damn people.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.290
Help.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.042
Help.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.168
Hang on.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.671
Help me. Please.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.757
Don't leave me!

07:03.923 --> 07:07.218
They tied me up here
and left me for the Zs!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.846
Bastards. Who? Who did this to you?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.222
[all growling]

07:14.392 --> 07:15.226
Help me!

07:15.894 --> 07:16.937
Let's get her down.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.105
For God's sake, hurry!

07:24.319 --> 07:26.196
You guys keep them busy. I got an idea.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.743
No...

07:32.118 --> 07:33.203
Brains...

07:33.286 --> 07:34.371
today.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.712
Here, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie!
Come on! Come on!

07:43.129 --> 07:44.756
Good zombie. Who wants to go for a ride?

07:44.881 --> 07:47.592
You want to go for a ride?
Come on, let's go for a ride.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.344
Good zombies.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.473
Come on. Good.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.017
Good zombies. Hey, hey, hey.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.729
Keep your hands and teeth
inside the ride at all times.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.315
[growling]

08:05.026 --> 08:07.654
Good zombies. Stay.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.614
[growls]

08:21.167 --> 08:22.877
Open the door! Open the door!

08:32.762 --> 08:35.557
You done playing around?
I'm dying up here.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.397
Hey, whoa. Whoa, take it easy.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.025
You're gonna get sick
if you drink it that fast.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.445
-She OK?
-She'll live.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.363
Good. Let's get her out of here
and get back on the road.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.281
Wait. Hold on.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.494
What happened? Who did this to you?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.580
[hollering and muffled music]

09:00.957 --> 09:02.083
They did this?

09:03.710 --> 09:07.047
They put me up here.
Killed Jacko and Warlock.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.050
-My son is in there.
-They got your son?

09:10.800 --> 09:11.885
He's so dead.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.553
They killed your son?

09:13.803 --> 09:14.679
The men up there?

09:16.848 --> 09:17.849
That does it.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.684
Wait, wait, wait.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.643
Which men?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.771
And who's all in that shack?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.107
I'm putting a stop to this.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.651
-Murphy, don't do this.
-I've had enough, all right!

09:29.736 --> 09:30.945
Who's coming with me?

09:31.029 --> 09:33.740
Now, Murphy, I know you're hurting.
But this will not bring Lucy back.

09:34.616 --> 09:39.120
Or Red, Addy, Sun Mei, 5K or any of them.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.498
Neither will listening to you.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.794
For once I think he's right.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.007
We can't just do nothing.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.845
[music and laughter]

09:55.929 --> 09:57.639
Bad things happen
when you fight full of hate.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.701
[music and laughter continue]

10:22.372 --> 10:26.084
This is weird. A giant mushroom... thing?

10:26.334 --> 10:30.088
Good, you see it too?
I thought I was having a flashback.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.718
She seems like she's gonna be OK.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.347
We have to stop them.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.141
You can't.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.852
Murphy's blinded by PZT.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.270
PZT?

10:45.353 --> 10:49.023
Post Zombie Trauma. He's got it bad.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.568
Yeah, well, he can't kill what took Lucy.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.945
So, he's gonna kill
the next thing in his way.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.196
Same with the other two.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.992
This... This is gonna end in tears.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.077
Yeah, we got to stop it
before it starts.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.955
I'm not going in there.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.458
We go in there, we become a part of it.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.086
I'm not gonna be a part of it.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.296
Hey!

11:11.880 --> 11:13.798
You got any more of these
crappy sawdust bars?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.384
Or a Zagnut or something? Or Faygo?

11:16.467 --> 11:17.969
I'm still thirsty!

11:18.636 --> 11:19.929
Let me see what we got.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.441
How many you think are in there?

11:31.649 --> 11:32.692
Sounds like a lot.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.527
All the better.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.739
[gasps]

11:41.826 --> 11:42.660
Don't do this.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.164
-Go away, Warren. We got this.
-This is not our fight.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.709
You saved the woman.
She's gonna be fine. Let's go.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.711
These scumbags just don't get a pass.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.672
The Apocalypse is not an excuse.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.633
You just can't kill bad guys.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.218
Those aren't zombies. Those are humans.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.221
Not many of us left, even if we're...

12:02.639 --> 12:03.473
bad.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.517
Yeah, well it's time to drain
the gene pool.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.937
Her son could still be in there.
What if that was one of us?

12:09.103 --> 12:11.648
But it's not. We can't save everyone.

12:16.319 --> 12:20.031
They wouldn't stop. Just kept
kicking him upside the head.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.534
Then he says to me,
"Jenny G, you just a broke ass hoe.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.827
Why would anybody listen to you?"

12:24.911 --> 12:30.249
Me? Why'd anybody listen to you?
Faygo swilling poser.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.711
Scrub. I keep us safe.
I keep the party going.

12:34.504 --> 12:38.007
Boy, we used to have
some good times, though.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.302
We really used to tear it up, I tell you.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.304
This one time,

12:44.555 --> 12:48.309
Jesta comes driving up
in a Frito truck, right?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.187
A whole goddamn truck.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.607
[laughing] So anyway,
we're whooping it up,

12:54.691 --> 12:57.944
stuffing whole bags of Fritos
in our mouths.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.697
And then we're like, wait a minute,

13:01.531 --> 13:02.699
where's RingJack?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.618
And then I swear, right then,

13:05.952 --> 13:11.416
RingJack comes driving around
the corner in a Beer Truck.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.711
Holy shitface!

13:14.961 --> 13:17.547
Like manga from heaven.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.223
We got stupid for a week.

13:27.640 --> 13:34.022
Drinkin', eatin', humpin',
rappin', fightin', pukin',

13:34.147 --> 13:35.565
and starting all over again.

13:41.070 --> 13:41.988
Mad Zs.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.657
Wait. Those aren't Mad Zs. That's...

13:44.782 --> 13:46.576
Those are clowns.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.911
-[laughing]
-[snarling]

13:54.459 --> 13:55.293
Clowns?

13:56.127 --> 13:58.755
Could be worse. Could be mimes.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.852
So what's with all the circus crap?

14:13.436 --> 14:14.979
When the Zompocalypse hit,

14:15.063 --> 14:18.649
the boys decided to form their
own posse like their heroes,

14:18.733 --> 14:19.734
the Juggalos.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.319
Juggalos?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.237
Except we're the Zuggalos.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.782
We're our own thing.

14:26.991 --> 14:30.203
But I can't hate. We all family, right?

14:30.370 --> 14:34.916
Much family love. We all bleed Faygo,
you know what I mean.

14:37.210 --> 14:42.382
Family always comes back though.
It's always better together.

14:43.758 --> 14:44.926
Family.

14:45.968 --> 14:46.969
[groans]

14:49.055 --> 14:50.848
I don't feel so good.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.767
I need my medicine.

14:52.850 --> 14:56.771
What medicine? What kind?
Are you diabetic or something?

14:56.854 --> 15:01.651
It's for my brain. It makes me
feel better. I need it!

15:02.193 --> 15:06.280
It's in the house. I got to get it
before they do it all up.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.532
You don't need that.

15:07.657 --> 15:08.616
I'm sick.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.078
I'm hurting. Look.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.915
Come on! I need my Oxy!

15:15.998 --> 15:18.876
Oxy? I thought
they ran out of that years ago.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.046
We recycle it. Yep.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.926
Zuggalos got so much drugs
in their urine, we save it,

15:27.218 --> 15:31.013
filter it, dry it out,
snort it all over again.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.558
[laughing] We call it ZWak.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.642
ZWak?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.979
You like to party, honey? We got plenty.

15:38.104 --> 15:42.233
No. Thanks. The Apocalypse
makes me numb enough already.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.527
Well, la-di-freakin'-da.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.321
You think you're better than me?
That there's my house!

15:47.405 --> 15:49.282
That makes it my ZWak!

15:49.365 --> 15:50.283
That's your house?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.285
That's what I said, ain't it?
My boy's down there.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.163
You should stay and party.
Got all we need.

15:55.246 --> 16:01.544
We got ZWak. We got Pruno,
Zagnuts, Faygo, Fritos.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.839
Fritos saved my life!

16:06.674 --> 16:11.637
We even got music. Life ain't worth
livin' without the music.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.516
We still got solar, some batteries,
so we can go all night.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.520
King knows how to make the lights work.
He's good at that stuff.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.398
I'll kill him, though.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.569
I'll wear his nizzos for a necklace.
Discrespectin' me!

16:30.531 --> 16:34.285
Naw, I'm just messin' with ya, honey.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.080
But I'll mess him up for sure.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.210
-[laughing]
-[snarling]

16:48.674 --> 16:51.219
That's it. I've seen enough. Let's go.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.182
Wait.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.476
I'm ordering you not to do this.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.395
You're ordering me?
Get the hell out of my way, Warren.

17:01.521 --> 17:05.233
-More killing won't change anything.
-Like that ever stopped you.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.015
-Murphy, wait!
-[snarling]

17:39.559 --> 17:40.768
Don't do this.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.438
Don't do what?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.505
Welcome to our humble home.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.846
And Dark Carnival of Mayhem.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.768
Let the games begin!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.353
Games?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.772

That wasn't no answer!
He just threw up is all.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.375
That don't count as a yes!

36:09.876 --> 36:11.711
You want me running the family,
right baby?

36:12.379 --> 36:15.715
Junior ain't ready.
You want me to run the clan, right?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.968
Your sweetass sugar momma
running the family?

36:19.386 --> 36:20.595
Right, Daddy?

36:22.055 --> 36:24.516
See! He wants me! Ain't that right, Daddy?

36:25.517 --> 36:30.063
No! Daddy! You don't know
what you're grunting!

36:31.272 --> 36:33.274
I'm still your Momma!

36:34.192 --> 36:35.110
Goddammit!

36:35.193 --> 36:39.280
-Get off me, you crazy ho!
-Not till you stop actin' a fool!

36:39.364 --> 36:41.574
Say I'm right! Say it!

36:41.700 --> 36:42.701
Let go!

36:51.835 --> 36:53.753
I knew she'd like you.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.300
[groaning]

37:07.350 --> 37:10.603
Touch me again like that, boy,
you'll meet Zombie Jesus.

37:10.812 --> 37:11.646
I hate you!

37:14.149 --> 37:16.568
Cry baby. I never wanted you.

37:17.444 --> 37:19.821
Why can't you just be
a normal mom for once?

37:34.419 --> 37:36.504
Stop trying to kill your mom!

37:36.963 --> 37:39.090
You know, it's hard
being a parent these days!

37:39.299 --> 37:40.800
-She tried to kill me!
-Yeah!

37:41.134 --> 37:43.845
Well, you know she obviously
cares about you.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.431
She's conflicted!
Did you ever think of that?

37:47.474 --> 37:50.101
You know, I've been a selfish prick
my whole life.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.061
But then my little girl was born,

37:52.479 --> 37:55.398
and suddenly I wanted something
for someone else.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.234
By the time I figured that out,
it was too late.

37:59.861 --> 38:03.865
And now my little girl is gone.
But you two, you still have each other!

38:04.407 --> 38:06.826
-Don't mess that up!
-It's not me! It's her!

38:07.744 --> 38:08.870
-[zapping]
-[screaming]

38:10.663 --> 38:13.625
Stop putting up walls
and thinking it's all her fault!

38:13.792 --> 38:14.626
Listen to her!

38:15.835 --> 38:18.046
Damn right. You don't listen!

38:20.006 --> 38:21.716
And you. You know,

38:21.966 --> 38:24.511
there's no right or wrong way
to do this parenting thing.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.096
You know, I take that back.
I think you're probably doing it wrong.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.725
You need to see him for who he is,
for the man that he is.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.727
He's not that little boy anymore.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.895
That's what I'm saying!

38:33.978 --> 38:34.813
Shut up!

38:34.896 --> 38:37.190
You're lucky. You got to see him grow up.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.777
My little girl, she grew up so fast,
I never got to see that.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.571
Never saw her for who she was.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.617
And she needed me to see that.
He needs you to see that.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.661
See him!

38:50.995 --> 38:51.955
I see him.

38:53.915 --> 38:58.127
I see if he doesn't
get his clown ass off my back,

38:58.211 --> 38:59.671
I'm gonna beat him down!

38:59.754 --> 39:00.922
You bitch!

39:09.931 --> 39:10.765
King!

39:24.988 --> 39:26.197
Run, you clown!

39:26.322 --> 39:28.533
[screams]

39:29.284 --> 39:31.160
This is bad. Even for us.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.248
Time to GTFO.

39:48.803 --> 39:49.804
[whimpers]

39:52.223 --> 39:54.350
-[growling]
-[screams]

40:23.880 --> 40:24.714
You were right.

40:27.926 --> 40:28.760
About what?

40:30.011 --> 40:31.012
About Lucy.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.100
What happened was...

40:37.852 --> 40:38.895
my fault.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.529
Look, I...

40:50.782 --> 40:52.241
I don't know what we're doing.

40:54.452 --> 40:58.539
These dreams, visions, hallucinations...

41:02.585 --> 41:04.337
it's leading us nowhere.

41:06.923 --> 41:09.008
And I still don't know what it means.

41:15.682 --> 41:20.019
I can't have anyone following me
around until I figure it out.

41:22.105 --> 41:24.148
So we head to Newmerica.

41:29.112 --> 41:29.946
North!

41:31.948 --> 41:33.658
Copy! North, Lieutenant.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.415
Newmerica?

41:42.792 --> 41:44.377
Yeah, Newmerica.
