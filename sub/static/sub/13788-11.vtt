WEBVTT

00:06.177 --> 00:09.130
I am ready for our family
meeting. What's our agenda?

00:09.130 --> 00:11.842
Fooling your brother and sister
into coming to a family meeting.

00:11.842 --> 00:15.976
Tyler, Chloe, there's a clown
in the kitchen.

00:15.976 --> 00:18.769
Is he juggling? Does he have
a bucket of confetti?

00:18.769 --> 00:23.734
There's no clown here.
It's a trap, Tyler! Run for it!

00:23.734 --> 00:27.648
OK, family meeting has begun.

00:27.648 --> 00:31.822
Your father and I want to take
a fun family trip over the long
weekend. We're open to ideas.

00:31.822 --> 00:33.654
[high-pitched voice]
I say we go camping.

00:33.654 --> 00:37.958
[normal voice]
That is a great idea,
family member.

00:37.958 --> 00:42.123
Can't I just spend the weekend
hanging out with my friends
instead of my family?

00:42.123 --> 00:45.336
I mean, no offense,
it's just I like my friends.

00:45.336 --> 00:48.719
It'll be great. I've always
wanted to try camping.

00:48.719 --> 00:50.301
[high-pitched voice]
We could pick berries.

00:50.301 --> 00:53.304
[normal voice]
Yes we could, family member.

00:53.304 --> 00:57.728
Yeah, hon, I'm not
so sure about camping.
I prefer more of a cabin.

00:57.728 --> 01:00.981
With a king size bed
and room service and a spa.

01:00.981 --> 01:03.684
More of a hotel.
Yeah, it's a hotel.

01:04.645 --> 01:07.818
I know where we should go!
The Space Museum.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.571
It has interactive displays
and a planetarium show.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.782
You lost me at "snoozefest."

01:11.782 --> 01:15.366
- I didn't say "snoozefest."
- Yes you did.

01:15.366 --> 01:19.660
It may be educational, but the
Space Museum is in New Mexico,

01:19.660 --> 01:23.464
so we'd have to stay at the
five-star resort next door.

01:23.464 --> 01:26.967
Aah, the sacrifices we make to
educate our children.

01:26.967 --> 01:30.971
I vote snoozefest--
uh, massage-- uh, Space Museum.

01:30.971 --> 01:33.384
I choose camping.
At least that's not educational.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.137
Well, actually, being
outdoors can teach you
all about--

01:36.137 --> 01:39.019
I'm on your side, Dad.
You want to lose me?

01:39.019 --> 01:42.062
You'll learn nothing, son.
It'll be just like
the tenth grade.

01:43.684 --> 01:45.646
Well that's Tyler and me
for camping,

01:45.646 --> 01:48.649
and Avery and Ellen
for Space Museum.

01:48.649 --> 01:51.572
Chloe, looks like
you're the deciding vote.

01:51.572 --> 01:52.613
This is a tough one.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.575
Well, you don't have
to tell us now.

01:54.575 --> 01:55.736
Think about it and let us know.

01:55.736 --> 01:58.038
Yeah, don't be influenced
by which parent

01:58.038 --> 01:59.700
gives the best piggyback rides,

01:59.700 --> 02:02.583
and which parent says,
"Ow, you're pulling
my clavicle!"

02:02.583 --> 02:05.666
She has chimp strength
in those little hands.

02:05.666 --> 02:08.048
I gotta think about this
and get it right.

02:08.048 --> 02:11.051
Not like the time I went for
Froyo, panicked at all the
choices

02:11.051 --> 02:12.513
and just got water.

02:12.513 --> 02:13.754
How did that happen?

02:14.845 --> 02:17.097
[theme song plays]

02:32.653 --> 02:36.076
Oh man, I really hope Chloe
chooses the Space Museum.

02:36.076 --> 02:38.619
Can I let you in
on a little secret, Stan?

02:38.619 --> 02:42.283
You always do. Sometimes in even
greater detail than I want.

02:42.283 --> 02:46.707
I was content to think the hair
magically disappeared from your
upper lip.

02:46.707 --> 02:52.753
The real reason I'm dying to go
to the Space Museum is because
Wes is going to be there.

02:52.753 --> 02:56.927
[gasps] Seeing him outside of
school would give me a chance
for a whole new start with him.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.639
And a chance to meet his
parents,

02:58.639 --> 03:00.511
so I won't have learned
all about duck calls

03:00.511 --> 03:02.473
to bond with his dad
for nothing.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.685
Oh, hey, Mr. Manning:

03:04.685 --> 03:07.728
[makes duck call]

03:07.728 --> 03:12.192
Then I definitely hope Chloe
picks the Space Museum.
And for me too.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.575
I want to learn about how
during the 50s and 60s,

03:14.575 --> 03:17.698
the Soviets used dogs
for sub-orbital and orbital
space flight

03:17.698 --> 03:20.911
to test the feasibility
of human travel.

03:20.911 --> 03:25.666
Not everything I say
is amusing or silly.
Sometimes it's educational.

03:25.666 --> 03:29.129
That's great, Stan.
And here's the best part.

03:29.129 --> 03:32.293
If we go to the Space Museum,
our hotel doesn't allow dogs,

03:32.293 --> 03:35.215
so you'll get to stay
at this fantastic kennel
I found for you.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.720
But I hate kennels!
They're cold, they're loud,
and they only have basic cable.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.934
Professional wrestling
storylines don't stop
because I'm not watching.

03:43.934 --> 03:47.688
This isn't just a typical
kennel. I've done a lot of
research,

03:47.688 --> 03:50.190
and this place is like
a resort for dogs.

03:50.190 --> 03:52.773
But a kennel, Avery, a kennel!

03:52.773 --> 03:56.317
Sometimes when I get upset I say
words over and over again.

03:56.317 --> 04:00.160
Over and over again,
Avery, over and over again!

04:00.160 --> 04:04.865
They've got pools and play
spaces and other dogs to run
around with.

04:04.865 --> 04:07.368
You know I wouldn't put you
somewhere that wasn't great.

04:07.368 --> 04:11.502
Really? What about the time you
left me alone with that crazy
woman who hates dogs?

04:11.502 --> 04:14.425
- Mom?
- Yes!

04:14.425 --> 04:18.469
"I do not like kennels. Sure,
they're fine for regular dogs,

04:18.469 --> 04:21.181
but there's no one for me to
talk to in there.

04:21.181 --> 04:22.803
They wouldn't stick Avery,
Chloe, or Tyler

04:22.803 --> 04:25.516
in a kennel, would they?
Well, maybe Tyler.

04:30.651 --> 04:32.983
She really wants
to do it this way?

04:32.983 --> 04:35.235
She doesn't have much power
in the family.

04:35.235 --> 04:36.857
I thought this would
make her feel good.

04:36.857 --> 04:40.070
I have made my decision!

04:43.614 --> 04:46.747
Why couldn't we have gone here?

04:46.747 --> 04:50.000
Are you kidding?
The woods are great!

04:50.000 --> 04:53.834
I'm so glad Chloe picked it.
It's like a huge backyard

04:53.834 --> 04:58.799
with an infinite number of trees
to pee on. I finally understand
the expression,

04:58.799 --> 05:01.722
"The world is my toilet."

05:02.843 --> 05:03.724
That's not an expression.

05:03.724 --> 05:05.686
Well, it should be.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.808
Hey, and look at Robert
over there.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.771
Swinging from tree to tree
enjoying the fresh air.

05:12.813 --> 05:17.277
Don't climb too high, Robert!
He can't. I put him up there.

05:19.279 --> 05:22.703
Man, this is boring. But it's
still better than the museum.

05:22.703 --> 05:24.154
At least I haven't
learned anything.

05:24.154 --> 05:26.036
Tyler, don't touch that,
it's poison ivy!

05:26.036 --> 05:28.749
I told you,
I don't want to learn!

05:30.831 --> 05:34.835
Bennett, we've only been here
ten minutes and I've already
sweated a back face.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.300
Please tell me
there are showers
up here somewhere.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.133
Sure. There are communal showers
two campsites over.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.766
You know I don't
do communal showers!

05:45.766 --> 05:48.929
People get uncomfortable
when they see my gigantic
loofah.

05:50.771 --> 05:53.313
I knew camping was a bad idea.

05:53.313 --> 05:54.935
Wow, You're right, Daddy,

05:54.935 --> 05:59.570
she did start complaining
even before we put the stuff
down.

05:59.570 --> 06:03.484
OK, Chloe, let's set up the
camp site while I explain to you

06:03.484 --> 06:06.036
the meaning of the phrase
"just between you and me."

06:10.160 --> 06:14.755
Bad news, hon. There are
no fish living in that lake.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.920
That's all right. We'll just eat
some of the food we brought.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.261
Where's the ice chest
you packed?

06:21.261 --> 06:23.053
I told Tyler
to put it in the car.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.925
You did?

06:27.638 --> 06:31.472
That's OK. We'll just drive
20 minutes into town and buy
some food.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.274
Where's my wallet?

06:36.146 --> 06:38.689
That's all right. I have
plenty of money in my purse.

06:41.361 --> 06:47.117
That's OK. We'll have a nice
hike, forage for food, and after
a long, rewarding day,

06:47.117 --> 06:49.910
we can snuggle up
in that deluxe tent I bought.

06:49.910 --> 06:54.034
[Ellen] How do you buy a tent
without poles?

06:54.034 --> 06:56.457
[Bennett] For the
hundredth time, the sign
at the yard sale said,

06:56.457 --> 07:00.170
"Tent - no poles."
I thought that meant
it didn't need them.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.252
- [Avery] I'm hungry.
- [Bennett] Just be patient.

07:02.252 --> 07:04.304
The raw spaghetti
those nice campers gave us

07:04.304 --> 07:06.717
should be expanding in
our stomachs any time now.

07:08.138 --> 07:09.890
Chloe, what are you chewing?

07:09.890 --> 07:11.351
[Chloe] Nothing.

07:11.351 --> 07:13.724
[Avery] She has gummy bears!

07:13.724 --> 07:15.435
[Avery and Tyler] Get her!

07:15.435 --> 07:18.479
[all yelling]

07:21.321 --> 07:23.654
Well, after two
miserable days up here,

07:23.654 --> 07:25.325
I can say the one good thing
about having forgotten

07:25.325 --> 07:27.027
the food is it's not
as big a problem

07:27.027 --> 07:28.909
that we also
forgot the toilet paper.

07:31.832 --> 07:36.126
Why did I choose camping?
I can't even get any cell phone
reception out here.

07:36.126 --> 07:42.002
If I send a text in the woods
and no one receives it,
do I even exist?

07:42.002 --> 07:45.215
I just had the loveliest walk.

07:45.215 --> 07:49.930
Well, for someone who's been
scrounging for food for two days
and sleeping in a ground tent,

07:49.930 --> 07:51.552
you're in a good mood.

07:51.552 --> 07:54.304
I realized no one here
cares how I look or smell.

07:54.304 --> 07:57.858
And then it happened,
Bennett: I embraced my funk.

07:57.858 --> 08:00.521
It's liberating!

08:00.521 --> 08:05.776
Well, I'm glad someone here
is happy. Is that lichen
growing on you?

08:05.776 --> 08:11.872
And I'm taking a lichen to it.
Ha-ha, good one, Gaia. That's
what I'm calling myself now.

08:11.872 --> 08:17.828
OK, let's get you in the
shade. The heat is not doing
good things to your funk, Guy.

08:17.828 --> 08:21.922
- Gaia.
- I know, but you
smell like a dude.

08:21.922 --> 08:24.965
I can't believe I could be at
the Space Museum right now,

08:24.965 --> 08:27.838
accidentally on purpose
running into Wes.

08:27.838 --> 08:31.391
"Oh. Hey, Wes. Small world."
[chuckles]

08:31.391 --> 08:33.634
"And if you join me
for the planetarium show,

08:33.634 --> 08:36.557
we'll find out just how
small it is. Shall we?"

08:38.018 --> 08:40.140
So it wasn't about learning?

08:40.140 --> 08:44.194
You wanted to go to
the Space Museum to scam a date?

08:44.194 --> 08:46.697
Today you are my sister.

08:48.448 --> 08:50.360
This is all your fault, Chloe.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.862
I can't believe
you picked camping.

08:51.862 --> 08:54.284
Don't be mad at me.
Be mad at Stan.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.077
He told me there'd be wise owls
and animals who could sing.

08:57.077 --> 08:59.830
I didn't really believe it,
but a part of me still hoped.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.292
I am a little kid.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.796
Wait. Stan? You convinced
Chloe to pick this?

09:05.796 --> 09:09.259
What?! No.
How could you think I--

09:09.259 --> 09:11.632
Yeah, I totally did that.

09:11.632 --> 09:14.765
You tricked me, Stan.
There are no wise owls here.

09:14.765 --> 09:18.849
I saw an owl last night.
And he was stupid!

09:18.849 --> 09:23.814
Stan, you knew how much I wanted
to go to the museum and connect
with Wes.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.775
Why would you do that to me?

09:24.775 --> 09:26.026
You were going to put me
in a kennel

09:26.026 --> 09:27.487
when I said
how much I hate that.

09:27.487 --> 09:28.989
Why would you do that to me?

09:28.989 --> 09:31.822
I wish we had put you
in a kennel, Stan.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.284
I'd rather be at
the hotel by the Space Museum

09:34.284 --> 09:36.406
having a spa day with Mom!

09:36.406 --> 09:40.701
That's right. That's how unhappy
I am right now!

09:40.701 --> 09:45.205
So you're all turning on me,
now huh? Thanks a lot. You
always told me we were friends.

09:45.205 --> 09:48.508
Yeah, well, friends
don't trick each other
and ruin each other's chances

09:48.508 --> 09:49.880
to have a whole
new start with Wes!

09:49.880 --> 09:51.882
Well, do friends
put each other in kennels?!

09:51.882 --> 09:54.675
Stan, you're not always
going to be able to do
everything with us.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.306
You have to accept that!

09:56.306 --> 09:58.679
I can't believe you don't care
how much I wanted to see Wes.

09:58.679 --> 10:01.021
Well, you don't care how much I
didn't want to go to the kennel.

10:01.021 --> 10:02.813
You're just like every
other selfish teenage girl

10:02.813 --> 10:04.645
who puts her own needs
before her friends!

10:04.645 --> 10:07.317
Well, you're not a regular
friend. You're a dog!

10:15.826 --> 10:20.240
You guys! You guys, wake up.
Tyler, Chloe, Stan is gone!

10:20.240 --> 10:21.872
- What?
- What do you mean?

10:21.872 --> 10:24.665
I think he ran away.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.843
I've looked all around.
I can't find Stan anywhere.

10:32.843 --> 10:35.635
That doesn't mean he ran away.
Maybe he just wandered off.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.639
Or went for a walk. Or rode
a skateboard. Or drove a car.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.523
Those are all things he's done,
so maybe he's doing one of them
again.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.686
No, he ran away.

10:45.686 --> 10:49.690
He left his collar next to
my pillow for me to find it.

10:49.690 --> 10:54.324
It must be because of
our fight. I told him he's not
a regular friend. He's a dog.

10:54.324 --> 10:57.698
You know how sensitive he is
about being thought of
as just a dog.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.280
It's just, he called me
a selfish teenager

11:00.280 --> 11:02.743
and I said the most hurtful
thing I could think of.

11:02.743 --> 11:05.585
[sighs] How could
I have done that?

11:05.585 --> 11:09.049
It's OK, Avery, we'll find him.
We have all day.

11:09.049 --> 11:13.463
He'll be OK. There are no
dangerous animals around here.

11:13.463 --> 11:16.466
OK, kids. I'm done
with this nature thing.

11:16.466 --> 11:17.928
Let's pack up, we're leaving.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.721
I don't know what made me
think I'm an outdoorsman.

11:20.721 --> 11:24.604
I'm an indoorsman.
And a pretty darn good one.

11:24.604 --> 11:26.897
I'm going to miss
being one with nature.

11:26.897 --> 11:30.731
A caterpillar has moved into
the moss that's growing in my
knee creases.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.403
I'm my own ecosystem.

11:33.403 --> 11:36.116
You guys, we can't leave yet.
Stan is missing.

11:36.116 --> 11:37.738
He must've wandered off.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.950
OK. I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about. We'll find him.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.322
Your mom and I will check
the other campsites in this
direction,

11:42.322 --> 11:44.494
and you kids search around this
area. Come on, Ellen.

11:44.494 --> 11:47.327
Oh wow, I think my caterpillar
has turned into a butterfly

11:47.327 --> 11:51.541
and left me a pupa. I'm the
mother of butterflies, Bennett.

11:51.541 --> 11:53.834
Oh, great. Another moth to feed.

11:55.886 --> 11:57.257
Come on, guys.

11:57.257 --> 11:59.469
- Stan!
- Stan, boy!

11:59.469 --> 12:01.762
- Stan, where are you?
- Come here, boy.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.805
[all] Stan!

12:04.805 --> 12:06.847
- Stan!
- Here, boy!

12:06.847 --> 12:12.652
Well, it's just you and me,
Robert. Avery hates me. Tyler
and Chloe are mad at me.

12:12.652 --> 12:16.777
They're just like every other
owner who eventually betrayed me
or abandoned me.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.699
What's that, Robert? You think
I have abandonment issues?

12:19.699 --> 12:23.363
Oh, so after three months being
lost in the couch cushions,
you were perfectly normal?

12:23.363 --> 12:27.537
Then why do you still wake up
screaming, "Crumbs!"?

12:27.537 --> 12:30.420
Well, I guess it's time
to go find the next family.

12:32.212 --> 12:34.795
Hey, sorry to intrude but--

12:34.795 --> 12:39.009
Oh, I remember you
from the communal showers.
Good to see you.

12:41.471 --> 12:44.845
Anyhow, we lost our dog.
Honey, show them the picture
on your phone.

12:44.845 --> 12:48.228
Yeah. Yes, I know,
I'm dirty and gross.

12:48.228 --> 12:52.062
The campers at the last
campsite thought I was feral
and tried to educate me.

12:52.062 --> 12:56.196
But we're missing our dog.
Have you seen him?

12:56.196 --> 12:59.990
Oh, come on, you can stand
the stench for two seconds.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.782
I shared a flat tent
with her last night.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.535
You promised to love me
'til death do us part.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.908
You smell
a couple days past death.

13:09.209 --> 13:10.250
See ya later.

13:12.002 --> 13:14.714
Please, please, please
tell me you found him.

13:14.714 --> 13:17.007
I'm sorry, kids. We didn't.

13:17.007 --> 13:21.131
We didn't find him either.
Not even Mountain Man
could find him,

13:21.131 --> 13:25.635
and he can track anything!

13:25.635 --> 13:29.689
Kids, we've looked everywhere
and we stayed all day.
It's time to go.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.351
No. We can't leave without Stan.

13:31.351 --> 13:34.734
Honey, your father has work.
You kids have school.

13:34.734 --> 13:36.236
Don't rush back for me.

13:36.236 --> 13:38.648
My teachers all say I seem like
I'm a hundred miles away,

13:38.648 --> 13:40.901
so I might as well be.

13:40.901 --> 13:42.863
Listen, we talked
to the rangers at the station.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.325
They said they find
lost dogs all the time.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.117
We're doing everything we can.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.249
Yeah, they'll find Stan
and they'll call us.

13:49.249 --> 13:51.621
Now come on, we're
packing up our stuff
and getting in the car.

13:51.621 --> 13:53.753
No, I'm not getting
in the car with you.

13:53.753 --> 13:56.046
I don't want to get in the car
with your mother either.

13:56.046 --> 13:58.668
What if we tie you
to the front bumper like a deer

13:58.668 --> 14:01.511
and drive you
through a car wash?

14:01.511 --> 14:04.554
I'm game. [chuckles]
Good one, Ellen.

14:04.554 --> 14:06.887
Not the time,
not the time.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.600
We can't leave without Stan,
he's part of the family.

14:10.600 --> 14:15.645
Don't worry, Avery.
People will see this picture
and find Stan for the reward.

14:18.738 --> 14:23.033
Sweetie, we don't have
five gazillion dollars.

14:26.326 --> 14:27.988
Happy?

14:33.163 --> 14:36.917
Hey there, pup.
What's your name?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.668
Don't have your collar, huh?

14:38.668 --> 14:40.760
Nope. Traveling light.

14:40.760 --> 14:45.885
Well, I'm Bill. And I'll call
you, Hachtooshta.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.429
That's beautiful.
Is that a tongue indigenous
to these woods?

14:49.429 --> 14:52.682
Sorry, bug flew in my mouth.
[clears throat]

14:52.682 --> 14:56.776
I'm gonna call you
Doris Steinberg.

14:57.978 --> 15:00.941
Morris Steinberg.

15:00.941 --> 15:05.695
All right, Morris Steinberg
it is. I guess you could
be my new owner.

15:05.695 --> 15:08.198
But this time, I won't talk
or get too attached.

15:08.198 --> 15:12.372
I spend a lot of time
in these woods.
People call me a tree hugger.

15:12.372 --> 15:14.744
Just because
I like to hug trees.

15:14.744 --> 15:17.627
But I'll let you in
on a little secret.

15:17.627 --> 15:20.840
The trees like it too.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.802
OK, come here, you.

15:22.802 --> 15:26.426
I have to come to you?
All right.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.218
Ahhh!

15:28.218 --> 15:30.010
OK, I'm not judging.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.852
But you know what trees
like even more than hugging?

15:32.852 --> 15:34.224
Being tickled!

15:34.224 --> 15:36.606
[baby voice] Yes, you do!
[laughing]

15:36.606 --> 15:38.898
OK, now I'm judging.

15:38.898 --> 15:41.982
Stan! Stan!

15:43.023 --> 15:44.614
Stan!

15:44.614 --> 15:46.276
I'm sorry, sweetie.

15:46.276 --> 15:51.451
Hey, I promise he's gonna
turn up, but we gotta go.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.203
Come on.

15:59.579 --> 16:01.081
Stan?

16:12.592 --> 16:16.186
We can't leave Stan back there
in the woods. We need a plan.

16:16.186 --> 16:19.399
Just a plan, Avery? Don't you
watch movies and TV shows?

16:19.399 --> 16:22.902
What we need is a plan
so crazy it just might work.

16:22.902 --> 16:27.067
What if we wrap the house
in bacon? He'll smell it
and come home.

16:27.067 --> 16:29.529
No, he'd never smell the bacon
from all the way out there.

16:29.529 --> 16:32.662
Yes, Tyler. That's what's wrong
with that plan.

16:32.662 --> 16:37.327
What if we invent a giant
fur magnet and sweep it through
the woods to attract Stan?

16:37.327 --> 16:39.709
What about all the other
animals it would attract?

16:39.709 --> 16:43.083
Yes, Chloe. That's what's
wrong with that plan.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.715
All we can do
is go back and look.

16:45.715 --> 16:48.388
Tyler, you'll drive.
Chloe, you'll stay here

16:48.388 --> 16:50.760
and distract our parents
so they don't notice we're gone.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.512
How is that so crazy
it just might work?

16:52.512 --> 16:55.185
Oh, I'll distract them
in a crazy way.

16:55.185 --> 16:57.767
Now I'm comfortable with this.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.644
Here's the next life lesson
I want to teach you,
Morris Steinberg.

17:04.644 --> 17:07.817
Pain is only in your head.

17:07.817 --> 17:09.989
And sometimes your foot!

17:11.821 --> 17:14.784
Maybe this wasn't
the best choice as new owner.

17:14.784 --> 17:18.828
Who am I kidding?
No one would feel
like a good choice right now.

17:18.828 --> 17:21.751
No one
is Avery, Tyler, and Chloe.

17:21.751 --> 17:25.165
♪ When I look at you
I don't think you see ♪

17:25.165 --> 17:30.260
♪ Just how much
you mean to me ♪

17:30.260 --> 17:33.803
♪ When I think of you
I'm not sure you know ♪

17:33.803 --> 17:37.637
♪ Just how much I love you so ♪

17:37.637 --> 17:42.772
♪ Just how much
I love you so ♪

17:42.772 --> 17:45.775
So.

17:45.775 --> 17:49.239
That is just so wrong.

17:49.239 --> 17:54.404
No, no no, I've made
a huge mistake. I've gotta
get back to my family.

17:54.404 --> 17:59.579
Come on, Morris Steinberg. We're
breaking camp and hiking to my
car so we can drive to Santa Fe.

17:59.579 --> 18:04.043
From there it's on to
Washington D.C. so I can scream
at the Washington Monument.

18:04.043 --> 18:07.837
"What do you have to do with
George Washington?
You look nothing like him!"

18:07.837 --> 18:10.420
Then we'll get a hot dog.

18:13.713 --> 18:16.015
I'm ready to distract
Mommy and Daddy.

18:16.015 --> 18:18.428
- Did you guys find Stan yet?...
- [Avery indistinct on phone]

18:18.428 --> 18:20.430
Fine, I'll stop interrupting you
and send you a text.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.812
[Avery] Chloe, you can't
text from a home phone.

18:22.812 --> 18:24.774
I know I can't text
on the home phone,

18:24.774 --> 18:27.937
but I'm not allowed to have a
cell phone so I have to pretend.

18:27.937 --> 18:31.110
My nightmare continues.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.284
OK, call us
if you hear anything.

18:34.284 --> 18:36.035
Yeah, thanks.
We'll check back with you later.

18:36.035 --> 18:37.697
Still no word.

18:37.697 --> 18:40.119
At least they got the missing
dog posters we emailed.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.913
The kids are awfully
quiet up there. Should we
go check on them?

18:43.913 --> 18:47.207
[Avery] Tyler, stop bugging me.
That is so annoying.

18:47.207 --> 18:49.749
[Tyler] You're the one
who's being annoying.

18:49.749 --> 18:51.711
Let's go see what's going on.

18:51.711 --> 18:57.467
[Avery] I'm sorry, Tyler.
I didn't mean it.
I'm just a little on edge.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.889
[Tyler] I didn't mean it,
either. You're a good sister.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.763
Good thing Mom and Dad
are leaving us alone
to resolve this ourselves.

19:03.763 --> 19:07.937
[Avery] I know. It really
strengthens our relationship.

19:13.653 --> 19:19.659
All good. T.T.Y.L.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.041
[sighs] One day.

19:24.744 --> 19:27.627
Come on, Morris Steinberg.
What's wrong with you?

19:27.627 --> 19:29.709
I just know the kids
must be looking for me.

19:29.709 --> 19:33.593
I can't let him take me
to New Mexico. I've gotta stall.

19:33.593 --> 19:36.296
- Stan. Stan!
- Stan.

19:36.296 --> 19:37.797
Don't worry, kids.
We'll find him.

19:37.797 --> 19:38.968
Stan!

19:38.968 --> 19:42.222
- [Avery and Tyler] Stan!
- [barking]

19:43.513 --> 19:46.726
That sounded like Stan! Stan!

19:46.726 --> 19:48.017
[Tyler] Stan!

19:49.649 --> 19:51.861
Stan!

19:53.022 --> 19:55.114
What are you doing
with Morris Steinberg?

19:55.114 --> 19:57.407
This is our dog, Stan.

19:57.407 --> 20:00.660
"Stan"? What kind of name
is that for a dog?

20:00.660 --> 20:02.742
We've been looking
everywhere for him.

20:02.742 --> 20:05.705
In that case, I'm glad you found
him. It's for the best anyway.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.668
When I got to New Mexico,
I was going to check out
the Space Museum,

20:08.668 --> 20:10.790
and I would've
had to kennel him.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.425
Goodbye, Morris Steinberg.

20:17.797 --> 20:20.800
Sir, thank you so much for
helping us find our dog.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.182
But would you mind giving us
a minute alone with him?

20:23.182 --> 20:25.014
Sure, I'll wait for you
at the trail head.

20:25.014 --> 20:27.397
When you're ready, we can walk
down and talk about

20:27.397 --> 20:32.692
this little matter
of the four gazillion dollars
I believe I'm due.

20:32.692 --> 20:37.026
[Bill] Goodbye, trees.
I'll always love you!

20:38.237 --> 20:41.861
Stan, why would you
run away like that?

20:41.861 --> 20:43.573
You told me I was just a dog.

20:43.573 --> 20:46.956
I'm so sorry. I just blurted
that out in a moment of anger.

20:46.956 --> 20:50.330
I've never
felt more horrible about
anything in my life.

20:50.330 --> 20:54.924
Really? Not even about the time
you broke my art project or
shaved a stripe in my hair?

20:55.965 --> 20:57.717
Just one second.

20:57.717 --> 21:01.301
Not. Important. Right. Now.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.725
Or the time you viciously
arm-spanked me in the woods?

21:05.725 --> 21:08.808
Stan, as bad as it was that
I said you were just a dog,

21:08.808 --> 21:10.810
it doesn't mean you should
just run away.

21:10.810 --> 21:12.231
But I thought we weren't
friends anymore.

21:12.231 --> 21:13.853
We never fought like that.

21:13.853 --> 21:17.196
Of course we're still friends.
We just had our first big fight.

21:17.196 --> 21:20.660
If you're really friends,
you have to stay
and work things out.

21:20.660 --> 21:26.406
I didn't know that. You're the
first real friend I've ever had.

21:26.406 --> 21:31.791
Oh my gosh, Stan. I'll always
be your friend no matter what.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.963
We can always work things out.

21:33.963 --> 21:36.796
I'll always be your friend, too.

21:39.759 --> 21:43.843
So, now that I've learned that
about friendship, I should
probably go find Robert.

21:43.843 --> 21:45.805
He said some things,
I said some things.

21:45.805 --> 21:50.430
He flung some of his stuffing
at me. That stuff is nasty.

21:50.430 --> 21:53.312
Well, let's go get the park
ranger, he can help us find
him.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.435
So, what did Robert say to you?

21:55.435 --> 21:59.399
Well, he's a monkey. So, he
said, "Ohh ohh aah aah aah!"

21:59.399 --> 22:02.822
But it was the way
that he said it.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.405
"I learned a lot about
what it means to be a friend.

22:05.405 --> 22:08.327
Now Avery and I are
closer than ever.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.289
And it meant a lot that the
kids were willing to be

22:10.289 --> 22:12.542
punished for
sneaking out to find me.

22:12.542 --> 22:16.085
Boy was it great
to come home to the family.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.168
I made up with Robert, too.

22:19.168 --> 22:21.170
Now we're
closer than we've ever been.
