<i>Building of the Old Summer
Palace started in 1709.</i>

01:04.566 --> 01:06.648
<i>Took more than 150 years to complete.</i>

01:06.774 --> 01:09.061
<i>Its magnificence awed the world.</i>

01:09.191 --> 01:11.558
<i>Envoys called it The Garden of Gardens.</i>

01:12.524 --> 01:15.642
<i>Haiyan Hall was its
largest Western mansion,</i>

01:15.774 --> 01:19.142
<i>where the 12 Chinese Zodiac statues stood,</i>

01:19.274 --> 01:21.982
<i>each majestically spouting water at noon!</i>

01:22.857 --> 01:27.021
<i>Foreign armies breached
Fort Dagu in July 1860,</i>

01:27.691 --> 01:30.888
<i>shattered the Empire's feeble defense.</i>

01:31.732 --> 01:32.847
<i>On 6th October 1860,</i>

01:32.982 --> 01:35.314
<i>the invaders stormed Old Summer Palace.</i>

01:35.441 --> 01:39.355
<i>Imperial treasures including
the 12 bronze statues</i>

01:39.482 --> 01:42.725
<i>were pillaged or burned.</i>

01:42.857 --> 01:46.054
<i>The fire lasted for three nights and days.</i>

01:46.191 --> 01:48.728
<i>This 150-year-old architectural masterpiece</i>

01:48.857 --> 01:50.939
<i>was razed to the ground.</i>

01:51.066 --> 01:53.979
<i>One, two, three!</i>

01:57.357 --> 02:00.725
Going once, going twice,

02:00.857 --> 02:01.722
Sold!

02:01.857 --> 02:02.938
Next item.

02:13.941 --> 02:18.139
A case of 24 bottles of
Chinese Maotai perfectly preserved,

02:18.274 --> 02:21.471
forgotten in a farm
cellar for over 55 years.

02:21.607 --> 02:24.019
Maotai's starting bid: 2 million euros,

02:24.149 --> 02:26.561
bids in increments of 100,000.

02:26.941 --> 02:28.682
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:29.316 --> 02:32.308
there are only four in the world.

02:42.607 --> 02:44.314
The Chinese ambassador.

02:44.441 --> 02:45.727
A pleasure to meet you.

02:45.857 --> 02:47.939
Please forgive my lateness, I'm sorry.

02:48.066 --> 02:50.979
We should be the ones to
ask your forgiveness.

02:51.107 --> 02:52.268
Take a look at the edges.

02:52.399 --> 02:55.437
All those years ago, because of the war,

02:55.566 --> 02:59.355
my ancestors brought back things
that did not belong to them.

02:59.482 --> 03:02.315
And every time I look at that bronze,

03:03.024 --> 03:04.640
I feel guilty.

03:05.357 --> 03:08.270
It's part of the common
heritage of mankind.

03:08.399 --> 03:11.687
It shouldn't belong to
one or two individuals.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.980
That's why I chose
to donate it to a Chinese museum.

03:16.107 --> 03:17.597
Sir it's my humble opinion,

03:17.732 --> 03:19.564
that if everybody thinks like you,

03:19.691 --> 03:22.149
the world would be a
better place to live in.

03:22.732 --> 03:24.598
I wish you every success

03:24.732 --> 03:28.396
in tracking down the rest
of the bronze heads.

03:28.524 --> 03:30.310
8.8,

03:30.441 --> 03:31.806
and sold!

03:32.732 --> 03:33.938
7 million!

03:34.066 --> 03:35.147
Sold!

03:35.274 --> 03:36.395
Congratulations, Mr. Morgan.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.814
MP Corporation is now the proud owner
of the world's four rarest stamps

03:38.941 --> 03:40.682
You're wrong. Not four.

03:40.816 --> 03:42.272
Now,

03:42.899 --> 03:46.517
there is only one in the world!

03:49.399 --> 03:51.891
Hey! Check it out!
MP Corporation is all over the news today.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.014
The boss is back.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.311
It's the only one of its kind left.

03:55.441 --> 03:58.433
Its values go triple overnight.

03:58.566 --> 03:59.522
Father's idea.

03:59.649 --> 04:00.514
Genius!

04:00.649 --> 04:03.266
You want a priceless antique?
I'll make it for you.

04:03.399 --> 04:04.230
Next!

04:04.357 --> 04:07.145
Percy's called, questioning our painting
Morning Light.

04:07.274 --> 04:08.139
Questioning?

04:08.274 --> 04:09.994
Well then, they don't even know to do that.

04:10.107 --> 04:13.600
Buy it back, like we always do,
for an elevated price.

04:13.732 --> 04:16.269
Because fake things tend
to become more real

04:16.399 --> 04:18.810
once they've been bought
and sold a few times

04:18.940 --> 04:19.726
Next!

04:19.857 --> 04:22.770
The 5th bronze head did very well.
It was a surprise to us.

04:22.899 --> 04:26.346
Recent buyers this auction season
were all businessmen

04:26.482 --> 04:28.644
who just love their country.

04:28.774 --> 04:32.221
That's because they'll do anything
for their own relics.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.974
Their patriotism equals our profit.

04:35.107 --> 04:36.063
Genius!

04:36.191 --> 04:37.556
These bronzes,

04:37.691 --> 04:40.558
each one higher than the last.

04:40.691 --> 04:43.149
How am I going to get my hands
on those bad boys?

04:43.274 --> 04:45.265
Names, give me names. Throw out names.

04:45.399 --> 04:46.639
Let's get the Vulture.

04:46.774 --> 04:48.811
Feels like it should be
someone closer to home.

04:48.941 --> 04:50.397
What about JC?

04:50.524 --> 04:52.561
He hasn't even found the
Roses painting yet.

04:52.691 --> 04:55.433
Roses? Don't worry about the Roses.

04:55.566 --> 04:57.148
You tell JC,

04:57.274 --> 04:59.561
if he can get me all the remaining heads,

04:59.691 --> 05:01.728
there's a massive bonus in it for him.

05:01.857 --> 05:03.689
As long as the money's right,

05:03.816 --> 05:05.727
JC will get you anything.

05:06.232 --> 05:09.975
You tell him it's one million euros each.

05:10.107 --> 05:12.064
If he gets us the dragon as well,

05:12.191 --> 05:13.431
I'll add another zero.

05:13.566 --> 05:14.556
Genius!

05:21.399 --> 05:23.481
Your car cannot pass!

05:27.149 --> 05:28.514
I want to pee.

05:28.649 --> 05:29.889
She's gorgeous!

05:30.024 --> 05:31.059
Please.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.063
Come this way.

05:33.191 --> 05:34.431
Thank you.

05:37.649 --> 05:39.731
Dad, that's brilliant.

05:39.857 --> 05:41.393
You know, it's the Year of the Dragon.

05:41.524 --> 05:44.124
- We're going to make a fortune.
- Go fool around with your girls!

06:17.691 --> 06:18.931
You go find JC, then

06:19.066 --> 06:20.227
No problem, I'll find him.

06:20.357 --> 06:22.018
Right, where is he now?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.106
He's probably on vacation.

06:24.607 --> 06:26.439
What's going on?

06:26.566 --> 06:27.977
I don't get this.

06:28.107 --> 06:29.347
What happened?

06:29.482 --> 06:32.224
There's a breach. Be alert!

06:41.649 --> 06:42.810
What is it?

06:43.357 --> 06:44.643
Someone has broken in!

06:44.774 --> 06:45.855
What's going on?

06:45.982 --> 06:47.268
Stop him!

06:57.107 --> 06:59.314
Stop or we will shoot!

06:59.816 --> 07:00.897
Get him!

07:01.399 --> 07:05.142
There's a breach, don't let him get away!

07:05.274 --> 07:06.264
Where are the keys?

07:09.857 --> 07:11.598
Get him!

07:11.732 --> 07:12.688
This way!

07:18.232 --> 07:20.064
He's under the car, get him!

07:21.066 --> 07:22.181
He's here!

07:27.107 --> 07:28.268
He's here!

07:39.441 --> 07:40.306
Get him!

07:40.441 --> 07:41.556
Shoot!

07:45.857 --> 07:46.767
Hurry!

08:29.941 --> 08:31.898
I can't see him. Can he out-race us?

08:40.149 --> 08:42.640
I can see our cars but nothing else.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.690
Where is he? I thought you'd cut him off.

08:47.482 --> 08:48.392
What is this?

08:49.524 --> 08:50.389
Get him!

09:01.107 --> 09:02.268
What's that?

09:17.774 --> 09:18.809
He is there!

09:56.524 --> 09:57.980
Oh my poor backside!

10:25.816 --> 10:27.147
Shoot!

10:50.524 --> 10:52.140
JC, okay?

10:53.857 --> 10:55.063
Go!

10:56.149 --> 10:57.435
Let's go.

10:59.982 --> 11:01.268
Hello?

11:01.399 --> 11:03.390
JC, it's Jonathan.

11:03.982 --> 11:05.393
Did you find the Roses?

11:05.524 --> 11:06.685
I am on vacation.

11:06.816 --> 11:08.932
I have a new assignment. Interested?

11:09.066 --> 11:10.306
How much do you pay?

11:10.441 --> 11:12.978
You know the 12 bronze heads
from Old Summer Palace?

11:13.107 --> 11:14.347
Chinese Zodiac?

11:15.441 --> 11:19.605
Chinese Zodiac

11:24.441 --> 11:25.772
<i>Professor Guan.</i>

11:25.899 --> 11:27.765
<i>Martin is from National Geographic Channel.</i>

11:27.899 --> 11:28.820
<i>This is Professor Guan.</i>

11:28.899 --> 11:30.435
<i>How are you, sir? How do you do?</i>

11:30.566 --> 11:34.013
National Geographic Channel
is very respectable.

11:34.149 --> 11:37.517
We need plenty of support for our work.

11:37.649 --> 11:38.764
Especially

11:38.899 --> 11:41.891
support from credible media like yours.

11:42.024 --> 11:45.016
We're doing a feature
on the 12 bronze heads.

11:45.149 --> 11:46.389
You are an expert on them.

11:46.524 --> 11:48.390
So we're here to learn from you.

11:48.524 --> 11:50.014
The pyramids of Egypt,

11:50.149 --> 11:52.356
the Parthenon of Greece,

11:52.482 --> 11:54.143
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat,

11:54.274 --> 11:56.766
are just like China's Old Summer Palace,

11:56.899 --> 11:58.856
where numerous treasures and relics

11:58.982 --> 12:01.940
were pillaged, destroyed, and stolen.

12:02.066 --> 12:04.023
How are you, sir? Good day, all.

12:04.149 --> 12:06.311
These students are from all over the world.

12:06.441 --> 12:08.933
<i>They've been working here for years,</i>

12:09.066 --> 12:11.854
<i>repatriating relics to their own countries.</i>

12:11.982 --> 12:14.565
<i>We need everyone to work hard.</i>

12:14.691 --> 12:17.854
<i>It takes centuries to create a miracle,</i>

12:17.982 --> 12:21.350
<i>but a bomb or fire can
destroy it in an instant.</i>

12:21.482 --> 12:23.849
<i>After much detailed research,</i>

12:24.607 --> 12:28.020
we came up with almost exact replicas.

12:28.941 --> 12:32.059
You are the first reporter to see them.

12:32.857 --> 12:34.097
No pictures!

12:35.024 --> 12:36.389
Sorry.

12:36.524 --> 12:37.889
Five of them have been auctioned.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.389
What about the rest?

12:39.524 --> 12:42.721
There are rumors of their whereabouts.

12:42.857 --> 12:44.723
One of my students in Paris,

12:44.857 --> 12:47.474
she's an expert in antiquity,

12:47.607 --> 12:51.475
has recently examined two auctioned heads.

12:51.607 --> 12:52.972
Which two?

12:53.107 --> 12:54.472
Rabbit-head,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.189
and this Rat-head.

12:57.024 --> 12:59.311
Can I get in touch with her?

13:00.024 --> 13:01.640
I'll contact her for you now.

13:01.774 --> 13:03.230
Thanks.

13:04.607 --> 13:05.563
Can I touch them?

13:05.691 --> 13:06.806
Certainly.

13:06.941 --> 13:08.397
Thanks.

13:13.816 --> 13:15.056
No need to be so serious!

13:15.191 --> 13:16.807
I must, I must

13:26.607 --> 13:27.847
It's coming.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.727
The Rat-head is finished.

14:11.857 --> 14:12.972
Is it very valuable?

14:13.107 --> 14:14.848
Depends on what you think is valuable.

14:14.982 --> 14:17.144
For 1O euros, you can have them both.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.313
This is your document.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.522
Welcome to Paris!

14:20.649 --> 14:21.980
Thank you.

14:40.732 --> 14:42.564
We are here for peace.

14:42.691 --> 14:43.897
Peace! Peace in your heart!

14:44.024 --> 14:45.014
Peace!

14:45.149 --> 14:46.355
Everybody! Okay?

14:46.482 --> 14:48.519
We will voice our concerns peacefully.

14:49.357 --> 14:50.267
You sure it is here?

14:50.399 --> 14:51.855
According to the GPS

14:53.191 --> 14:54.602
Then wait here.

14:56.524 --> 14:57.935
Paris!

14:58.066 --> 14:59.306
What?

14:59.441 --> 15:00.772
Are you kidding?

15:00.899 --> 15:01.809
It's your size! It's not your size!

15:01.941 --> 15:03.932
If it's not,
it was the seller who made a mistake.

15:04.066 --> 15:05.602
Get lost!

15:07.107 --> 15:08.848
It's over between us!

15:08.982 --> 15:10.564
No! It's not over! I love you, Coco!

15:10.691 --> 15:11.396
I love you.

15:11.524 --> 15:12.605
Love

15:12.732 --> 15:14.018
Love my ass!

15:14.774 --> 15:15.980
Okay! Okay!

15:16.107 --> 15:17.973
If that's how it is, give me back my keys!

15:19.566 --> 15:20.601
Who are you?

15:21.274 --> 15:22.230
Who are you?

15:22.357 --> 15:23.347
Professor Guan sent me.

15:23.482 --> 15:24.563
Just wait!

15:24.691 --> 15:26.557
Who's this fellow? Your new boyfriend?

15:27.191 --> 15:28.647
Yes!

15:28.774 --> 15:30.685
Thank you for catching.

15:30.816 --> 15:32.256
You're welcome. You don't have keys?

15:32.274 --> 15:34.481
She says it's over between us.
I just want my set of keys back

15:34.607 --> 15:36.348
so I can give it to another girlfriend.

15:38.191 --> 15:40.228
Sorry. I missed

15:40.774 --> 15:41.935
You missed...

15:46.107 --> 15:48.064
Let's go. Hurry up.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.813
You are Shangguan Ma-ding?

15:51.441 --> 15:52.556
Yes.

15:52.691 --> 15:53.977
But my research told me...

15:54.107 --> 15:56.644
Shangguan Ma-ding has passed away.

15:56.774 --> 15:59.266
That was my cousin. I am Martin Shangguan.

15:59.399 --> 16:00.389
Oh, really?

16:01.232 --> 16:02.722
Follow me, then.

16:03.899 --> 16:05.355
Boys and girls,

16:05.482 --> 16:08.144
Martin is from National Geographic Channel.

16:08.274 --> 16:12.222
He is here to do a feature
on the bronze heads.

16:13.316 --> 16:14.806
We need all the help we can get

16:14.941 --> 16:16.898
from mainstream media like
National Geographic Channel.

16:17.024 --> 16:18.560
I'll do my best.

16:18.691 --> 16:21.183
A common goal among us young people

16:21.316 --> 16:23.808
is to retrieve lost relics
for various countries.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.649
Of course, they include
the 12 bronze heads.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.937
These are the two in France?

16:31.066 --> 16:31.680
Yes.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.773
They belong to Count Marceau.

16:33.899 --> 16:34.980
I examined them.

16:35.107 --> 16:36.689
Professor Guan verified their data.

16:36.816 --> 16:37.772
They're authentic.

16:37.899 --> 16:39.139
He lives in that chateau?

16:39.274 --> 16:40.514
Sorry!

16:40.941 --> 16:42.477
Occupational habit.

16:43.107 --> 16:44.188
Guys!

16:44.316 --> 16:45.056
Over here.

16:45.191 --> 16:46.556
What's going on?

16:46.691 --> 16:47.852
What's wrong, guys'?

16:47.982 --> 16:50.189
I was walking with Wu Qing,
we were keeping surveillance on a cargo

16:50.316 --> 16:51.356
No battery no memory card.

16:51.357 --> 16:52.563
Which we suspect of being stolen antiques.

16:52.691 --> 16:55.308
Suddenly,
all these guys started beating us up!

16:55.441 --> 16:57.682
They only stopped
when I tried to call the police.

16:57.816 --> 16:58.726
It's too risky.

16:58.857 --> 17:00.518
I've told you many times,
we only protest in peace.

17:00.649 --> 17:01.609
Why didn't you stop him?

17:01.691 --> 17:02.852
No, listen...

17:02.982 --> 17:04.518
No, guys. Listen to me.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.313
I'd like to remind all of you about
the principles of our organization.

17:08.441 --> 17:10.772
One, we don't give the police any trouble.

17:10.898 --> 17:13.435
Two, we don't interfere
in the lives of the people.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.887
And three, we don't disturb social order.

17:17.023 --> 17:18.310
Absolutely!

17:18.441 --> 17:19.476
You have my support.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.689
Producer from National Geographic Channel.

17:22.816 --> 17:23.726
- Reporter?
- Yes.

17:23.857 --> 17:24.767
- Chinese?
- Yes.

17:24.898 --> 17:26.263
You must help us to expose MP's crime,

17:26.398 --> 17:27.434
make them look bad!

17:27.566 --> 17:29.898
No. As media, we can only report the facts.

17:30.024 --> 17:32.857
We cannot exaggerate and make things up.

17:32.982 --> 17:34.017
I have taken photos.

17:34.149 --> 17:35.639
You sit down!

17:35.774 --> 17:36.980
Be careful.

17:37.107 --> 17:39.018
I'm sorry this happened
on your first visit.

17:39.149 --> 17:41.436
We've got nothing else for you, goodbye.

17:42.149 --> 17:43.230
Can I have a word with you?

17:43.357 --> 17:44.347
Sure.

17:45.274 --> 17:46.514
Over here

17:48.649 --> 17:49.480
What's the matter?

17:49.607 --> 17:52.144
These people, these big corporations

17:52.274 --> 17:54.481
You and your students must...

17:54.607 --> 17:56.564
Okay, thanks, stay in touch!

17:56.691 --> 17:57.647
What on earth?

17:58.107 --> 17:59.028
He'll crack their code.

17:59.107 --> 17:59.391
Sure.

17:59.524 --> 18:01.106
When the time comes, I might be there.

18:01.232 --> 18:02.722
You're responsible for my getaway.

18:02.857 --> 18:04.894
The Chateau's landscape is flat.

18:05.024 --> 18:06.345
There is only one low-lying area.

18:06.441 --> 18:08.307
You meet me at the low-lying area.

18:13.524 --> 18:14.730
Follow me.

18:40.482 --> 18:42.849
Monsieur Pierre, during
our phone conversation,

18:42.982 --> 18:45.599
you said you wanted more information
about our bronze heads.

18:45.732 --> 18:47.222
We've brought you this portfolio.

18:47.357 --> 18:49.473
I'm sure you'll find everything inside.

18:49.607 --> 18:52.679
Madam, I beg you to pick up the phone!

18:53.691 --> 18:55.932
Are you sure of their authenticity?

18:56.066 --> 18:57.397
Yes, of course.

18:57.524 --> 18:59.811
Indeed, there are many replicas
on the market now.

18:59.941 --> 19:02.524
Even experienced collectors
have been fooled.

19:02.649 --> 19:04.765
If you have doubts,
you're free to test them.

19:04.899 --> 19:06.060
Okay, let me keep the book.

19:06.191 --> 19:07.022
I will contact you soon.

19:07.149 --> 19:08.560
Call me back.

19:11.566 --> 19:14.228
He used his hands to
flip through the album.

19:15.816 --> 19:17.682
I think he's heading to the vault.

19:17.816 --> 19:20.353
Their surveillance systems
are installed outside,

19:20.482 --> 19:22.314
for fear of damaging the relics.

19:22.441 --> 19:23.601
It seems that we are spot on,

19:23.691 --> 19:25.932
the owner is obsessed with tidiness!

19:26.066 --> 19:27.522
Just like you: A mysophobic!

19:27.649 --> 19:29.014
Now we can only wait.

19:29.149 --> 19:30.605
Let's wait, then.

19:35.357 --> 19:37.064
They're all seeing their boss off.

19:37.191 --> 19:38.431
I am watching.

19:40.941 --> 19:42.682
Tell me when you are ready.

19:44.274 --> 19:45.480
We are ready!

19:51.941 --> 19:53.181
In five seconds

20:35.649 --> 20:37.014
I can see the fingerprints.

20:40.899 --> 20:41.604
Hurry up.

20:41.732 --> 20:43.348
They're coming back.

20:48.732 --> 20:50.564
Found it! It's behind the bookshelf.

21:13.691 --> 21:15.477
Same old trick.

21:22.232 --> 21:23.017
Damn it!

21:23.149 --> 21:23.889
What's wrong?

21:24.024 --> 21:27.437
Three sets of combination
of 46 letters each!

21:27.566 --> 21:29.648
It'll take eight computers two days
to crack it.

21:55.191 --> 21:56.522
Weird!

21:56.649 --> 21:58.356
What has the boss been up to?

22:07.357 --> 22:08.688
Why would one obsessed

22:08.816 --> 22:11.103
with tidiness misplace his books?

22:18.149 --> 22:20.561
Should be put..

22:21.191 --> 22:22.431
Here.

22:25.941 --> 22:27.648
Here.

22:32.316 --> 22:33.898
That's how he reminds himself
of the combinations!

22:34.024 --> 22:35.731
Marion.

22:35.857 --> 22:36.642
Yes, sir?

22:36.774 --> 22:38.060
Some coffee, please.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.932
Very good, sir.

22:40.066 --> 22:41.932
- Let's go.
- Okay.

22:50.274 --> 22:51.764
I know how to open it.

23:14.816 --> 23:16.056
It's opened.

23:27.857 --> 23:29.347
Found the bronze heads yet?

23:31.941 --> 23:33.352
Give me a minute.

23:42.607 --> 23:43.642
The Rat-head,

23:47.191 --> 23:47.976
the Rabbit-head.

23:48.107 --> 23:49.814
Do they look like our replicas?

23:50.732 --> 23:52.973
To me... they're all the same.

23:54.691 --> 23:56.557
Is there anything else worth taking?

24:03.607 --> 24:05.097
They're all junk!

24:07.857 --> 24:09.017
You know what I've just seen?

24:09.399 --> 24:10.355
What?

24:10.482 --> 24:12.894
The Pharaoh's scepter and
the Czarina's staff,

24:13.024 --> 24:14.310
the Golden Eagle Box,

24:14.441 --> 24:15.852
and the Star of Arabia!

24:15.982 --> 24:17.973
They're all lost national relics!

24:18.107 --> 24:20.644
Now, they belong to us.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.230
Guess what else I've found?

24:44.357 --> 24:45.392
What?

24:47.149 --> 24:49.516
A painting that we dreamt of stealing.

24:50.399 --> 24:51.855
The Roses?

24:51.982 --> 24:53.393
Bingo!

25:01.941 --> 25:03.648
I've been looking all over for you,

25:03.774 --> 25:05.731
Now you show up by yourself.

25:06.524 --> 25:08.231
Lucky me.

25:09.982 --> 25:12.974
Just look at this photo.

25:14.941 --> 25:16.557
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

25:16.691 --> 25:18.398
Who are you?

25:18.524 --> 25:19.764
What are you doing?

25:19.899 --> 25:21.981
Guards!

25:22.107 --> 25:23.313
<i>Hey! Stop!</i>

25:24.441 --> 25:25.602
<i>We've a situation!</i>

25:26.191 --> 25:27.231
<i>He's upstairs! Go get him!</i>

25:27.357 --> 25:28.813
They saw me!

25:32.274 --> 25:33.480
What's going on?

25:36.816 --> 25:38.417
I am still inside, being chased by dogs.

25:38.524 --> 25:39.810
Give me directions!

25:46.649 --> 25:48.014
There he is!

26:04.441 --> 26:06.273
Look! He is on the roof!

26:06.399 --> 26:07.685
Go get him!

26:07.816 --> 26:09.306
Go that way.

26:29.441 --> 26:30.806
Catch me if you can!

26:31.232 --> 26:32.438
More of the same?

26:47.566 --> 26:49.102
I'm southeast of the chateau,

26:49.232 --> 26:50.722
tell me where to go!

26:54.732 --> 26:55.517
There's a maze ahead of you,

26:55.649 --> 26:56.980
stay out of it!

27:00.191 --> 27:01.522
I think I'm already in it!

27:01.649 --> 27:02.730
Can you take the high road?

27:02.857 --> 27:04.018
No room for a take-off!

27:04.149 --> 27:05.514
I've to give it a try.

27:09.774 --> 27:10.774
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

27:10.816 --> 27:12.352
I'm coming your way!

27:14.566 --> 27:16.227
<i>It's no time for nursery rhymes!</i>

27:17.857 --> 27:19.894
Cut the crap and find me an exit!

27:20.024 --> 27:22.436
<i>We can't see you unless you're airborne!</i>

27:46.357 --> 27:47.688
They stopped?

27:50.191 --> 27:51.727
Maybe they are short-sighted

28:10.899 --> 28:12.481
There he is! He's airborne!

28:16.649 --> 28:17.605
He's gone down again!

28:17.732 --> 28:18.847
The runway is too short!

28:25.524 --> 28:26.810
It's a dead end!

28:40.899 --> 28:41.764
What's that noise?

28:41.899 --> 28:43.060
I am mimicking a dog!

29:03.149 --> 29:04.310
Want a bite?

29:05.316 --> 29:06.806
Lie down!

29:06.941 --> 29:07.976
Nice!

29:08.566 --> 29:09.931
Nice dog.

29:10.066 --> 29:11.682
Stay put!

29:11.816 --> 29:13.056
Good doggie.

29:13.191 --> 29:13.805
Beat it!

29:15.816 --> 29:17.978
Speaking Chinese to a French dog?

29:18.899 --> 29:20.936
I'm surprised he could understand.

29:38.482 --> 29:39.438
We'll call you later.

29:39.566 --> 29:40.397
Okay.

29:40.524 --> 29:42.140
Guards

29:42.274 --> 29:43.730
<i>Go check it out right now!</i>

29:49.524 --> 29:50.730
I am out, finally!

29:51.191 --> 29:53.307
Call Simon and tell him to handle the rest.

29:53.441 --> 29:55.978
You do it. We're not on speaking terms.

30:08.024 --> 30:09.230
Martin?

30:14.357 --> 30:15.847
Martin!

30:16.607 --> 30:17.813
What are you doing?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.022
Do I know you?

30:19.149 --> 30:20.765
Was that you in the chateau?

30:20.899 --> 30:23.140
Coco, it was someone else.

30:23.274 --> 30:24.105
Someone else?

30:24.232 --> 30:25.563
You can address me by name!

30:25.691 --> 30:26.226
It was you!

30:26.357 --> 30:27.768
Watch out!

30:33.399 --> 30:34.264
It was you!

30:34.399 --> 30:36.015
Let go me!

30:37.149 --> 30:38.139
How could you steal?

30:38.274 --> 30:39.856
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:39.982 --> 30:41.462
We've been had! They knew each other!

30:41.482 --> 30:42.472
Good Lord!

30:42.607 --> 30:43.563
Go!

30:43.691 --> 30:44.647
Let go of me,

30:44.774 --> 30:45.605
and drive carefully!

30:45.732 --> 30:46.847
Are you still in denial?

30:46.982 --> 30:47.892
Okay, it was me.

30:48.024 --> 30:49.560
Why did you do that?

30:49.691 --> 30:51.602
This is not the time to explain.

30:54.066 --> 30:55.431
Watch out!

31:09.024 --> 31:09.889
You alright?

31:10.024 --> 31:11.480
I'll meet you at the boat house.

31:21.607 --> 31:24.474
Simon, I'm at your 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock above!

31:47.941 --> 31:48.851
Perfect!

31:51.024 --> 31:51.513
Where is the other head?

31:51.649 --> 31:52.935
Coco's got it.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.935
You're no reporter. Who are you really?

32:00.066 --> 32:00.771
Me?

32:00.899 --> 32:02.515
I have double identities.

32:02.649 --> 32:05.391
I am president of the non-profit making

32:05.524 --> 32:07.014
International Foundation of Relics...

32:07.149 --> 32:09.060
Metals, Porcelain and Paintings

32:09.191 --> 32:09.805
What?

32:09.941 --> 32:11.102
I've never heard of this organization.

32:11.232 --> 32:13.143
You know every one by heart?

32:13.274 --> 32:14.810
What should we do with this head?

32:14.941 --> 32:16.852
Return it to the Chinese government.

32:16.982 --> 32:18.017
Good idea!

32:20.982 --> 32:22.268
<i>Be careful, guys. Let's go!</i>

32:22.399 --> 32:23.764
<i>It's here! Let's go!</i>

32:25.024 --> 32:27.061
<i>Go, go! Let's go!</i>

32:32.566 --> 32:33.806
Hello.

32:41.232 --> 32:42.814
Oh, no. Not this.

32:43.316 --> 32:44.898
Hello, is this the police?

33:06.982 --> 33:07.847
What's going on?

33:07.982 --> 33:09.268
Don't come out!

33:11.566 --> 33:12.772
My power cable!

33:25.482 --> 33:26.893
Police! Don't move!

33:28.232 --> 33:29.768
Police! Police! Don't move!

33:34.357 --> 33:36.348
I swear that they are accomplices!

33:36.482 --> 33:37.688
It's not true!

33:37.816 --> 33:39.352
The Marceau family's
reputation is impeccable.

33:39.482 --> 33:41.598
Impeccable reputation?

33:41.732 --> 33:44.394
We've watched these tapes,

33:44.524 --> 33:45.730
and we saw nothing.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.189
There are customs documents,

33:48.316 --> 33:51.513
and a witness who saw
nothing at the chateau.

33:51.857 --> 33:54.474
She was estranged
after her uncle rejected a loan request.

33:54.607 --> 33:56.393
No, I was three when I last visited him.

33:56.524 --> 33:57.845
Do you really think I'd remember?

33:57.899 --> 33:59.890
- I swear to God that..
- Shut up!

34:00.857 --> 34:03.770
We will keep the statue for two weeks.

34:03.899 --> 34:05.435
If no one claims it,

34:05.566 --> 34:06.806
you can have it back.

34:06.941 --> 34:08.397
If they bother you again,

34:08.524 --> 34:09.685
let us know.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.726
Now, you are free to go.

34:11.857 --> 34:12.437
Thank you.

34:12.565 --> 34:14.431
- But that's not true!
- Shut up!

34:14.565 --> 34:15.522
I swear they stole the heads!

34:15.649 --> 34:17.686
You've other things to worry about!

34:17.940 --> 34:19.022
How did it go?

34:19.149 --> 34:20.856
Everything went as expected.

34:23.982 --> 34:25.063
I still want to thank

34:25.190 --> 34:27.228
this honest and beautiful
citizen of France.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.598
You're welcome. All I
did was tell the truth.

34:29.732 --> 34:31.268
My name is Catherine.

34:31.399 --> 34:33.766
You seem interested in those bronze heads.

34:33.899 --> 34:37.187
I have something at my house
you might be interested in.

34:37.315 --> 34:38.681
Well, think about it.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.931
Drive on, Bruno.

34:40.065 --> 34:41.226
Chateau Sichel.

34:41.857 --> 34:43.723
We've always wanted to visit this chateau.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.397
Welcome! I'm sorry.

34:46.524 --> 34:48.561
There are some routine
security measures here.

34:48.690 --> 34:51.103
The bank has taken
possession of everything.

34:51.232 --> 34:53.563
Nothing of value is
permitted to be taken out.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.647
It's okay.

34:54.774 --> 34:55.684
Beautiful castle!

34:55.815 --> 34:57.272
Please, follow me.

35:03.857 --> 35:04.892
Follow them.

35:05.399 --> 35:08.937
Our family went bankrupt
in the financial crisis.

35:09.066 --> 35:11.683
Still nice to be able to live here.

35:11.816 --> 35:13.147
Thank you.

35:14.441 --> 35:16.182
Your ancestors may have been

35:16.316 --> 35:19.479
the last people to see
these beautiful creatures.

35:19.607 --> 35:21.769
Yes, I know what you mean.

35:21.899 --> 35:25.563
Thing are only treasured
after they've disappeared.

35:25.982 --> 35:28.098
Yeah, you are right!

35:31.982 --> 35:33.222
Rooster?

35:33.357 --> 35:35.268
It's the reason I invited you here.

35:35.399 --> 35:36.764
Is that real?

35:36.899 --> 35:38.936
It's been here since I was born.

35:40.191 --> 35:42.148
This is stolen property, right?

35:42.274 --> 35:43.639
What did she say?

35:44.399 --> 35:46.936
She said beautiful staircase.

35:47.066 --> 35:48.477
Thank you.

35:49.357 --> 35:50.563
Let's go.

35:52.149 --> 35:54.641
This is my great-great-grandfather,

35:54.774 --> 35:56.185
her grandfather.

35:56.816 --> 35:58.773
Years ago he came back from overseas.

35:58.899 --> 36:02.437
He always wanted to set sail again
to find his second command

36:02.566 --> 36:05.274
but never had the funds to do so.

36:05.399 --> 36:08.312
Later his son, my grandma's father,

36:08.441 --> 36:09.681
put together an expedition

36:09.816 --> 36:12.478
and went to sea in search
of the Indestructible.

36:12.607 --> 36:13.688
But he never returned.

36:13.816 --> 36:15.853
He just disappeared mysteriously.

36:15.982 --> 36:18.440
I heard you have the animals' heads.

36:18.566 --> 36:22.605
Maybe you would have clues
about my great-grandfather?

36:24.816 --> 36:27.183
I don't give a damn!

36:27.316 --> 36:30.274
Bronze heads, scepter, diamond

36:30.399 --> 36:32.140
they can never be made public.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.313
The one I really want back is the painting.

36:34.441 --> 36:36.853
The value of what they've stolen
is over a billion dollars!

36:36.982 --> 36:40.100
If you'd installed an infrared security
system, things would have been

36:40.232 --> 36:41.153
So it's my fault, then?

36:41.274 --> 36:42.184
No, no, no...

36:42.316 --> 36:43.522
I'll make you a promise.

36:43.649 --> 36:45.686
If you don't recover that painting,

36:45.816 --> 36:47.682
I will strangle you myself!

36:54.649 --> 36:57.607
It's a rocking horse I
had when I was a child.

36:59.524 --> 37:04.473
My great-great grandfather painted this
after his return.

37:04.607 --> 37:08.805
It's the view he saw after
his ship was damaged.

37:08.941 --> 37:11.649
Why don't you have a look around?
I'll go get some tea.

37:11.774 --> 37:12.935
Thank you.

37:15.982 --> 37:16.767
Over there.

37:18.607 --> 37:20.689
Sorry, we need to talk in private.

37:22.816 --> 37:23.726
How can we steal the Rooster-head?

37:23.857 --> 37:26.770
Best is to stay here for
2 days, steal and go.

37:26.899 --> 37:27.513
<i>Not possible.</i>

37:27.649 --> 37:29.265
<i>At least replace it with a replica.</i>

37:29.399 --> 37:30.639
<i>But we need data to produce a replica.</i>

37:30.774 --> 37:32.139
Professor Guan has them.

37:32.274 --> 37:33.480
Talk to Coco.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.765
Never mention steal in front of her,

37:36.899 --> 37:38.185
otherwise she won't help.

37:38.316 --> 37:39.522
What should we do?

37:40.816 --> 37:42.056
Guys, look!

37:42.774 --> 37:44.936
Castiglione's Emperor
Qianlong's Autumn Hunt!

37:45.066 --> 37:45.726
Is it valuable?

37:45.857 --> 37:46.767
All antiquities are valuable.

37:46.899 --> 37:48.515
My granny's chamber pot
must be priceless, too!

37:48.649 --> 37:50.014
So this painting does exist!

37:50.149 --> 37:51.856
I thought it was destroyed in a fire.

37:52.857 --> 37:53.892
In 1860,

37:54.024 --> 37:57.722
my great-great grandfather sailed to China

37:57.857 --> 38:00.975
on Indestructible and won a great victory.

38:01.107 --> 38:03.849
This was one of the spoils of war
he brought back.

38:04.857 --> 38:08.304
You must mean
the ransacking of Old Summer Palace.

38:08.441 --> 38:11.513
That was during the Second
Opium War, remember?

38:11.649 --> 38:13.390
That depends on your point of view.

38:14.607 --> 38:15.472
Yes, she is right.

38:15.607 --> 38:17.894
The killing of British and French diplomats

38:18.024 --> 38:21.562
by the corrupt Qing Dynasty
was an excuse to start the war.

38:21.691 --> 38:26.561
Is that a legitimate reason for two
industrialized nations to invade country?

38:26.691 --> 38:28.451
In the eyes of those
industrialized nations,

38:28.524 --> 38:30.265
China was a superpower.

38:30.399 --> 38:34.097
True, we even called
ourselves Celestial Kingdom

38:34.232 --> 38:35.438
Whose side are you on?

38:35.899 --> 38:37.560
Yours, of course.

38:37.691 --> 38:38.681
Then?

38:38.816 --> 38:40.102
Sorry?

38:40.232 --> 38:41.688
What's next?

38:41.816 --> 38:44.148
On the way back, they met a storm,

38:44.274 --> 38:45.810
and the ship was damaged.

38:45.941 --> 38:48.399
I bet it was overladen with loot.

38:48.524 --> 38:50.185
Served them right.

38:50.316 --> 38:51.021
What did she say?

38:51.149 --> 38:52.935
Could you speak in English?

38:53.066 --> 38:55.023
I don't speak English.

38:56.024 --> 38:57.640
She said that's unfortunate

38:57.774 --> 38:59.981
I didn't say it was unfortunate.

39:00.107 --> 39:01.973
I said it served him right!

39:02.107 --> 39:03.597
Served him right?

39:03.732 --> 39:05.769
What a cruel thing to say!

39:05.899 --> 39:09.062
He went to China on orders of his country.

39:09.191 --> 39:11.728
It was his duty as a soldier.

39:11.857 --> 39:15.225
Fortunately, he was picked up
by a passing Chinese ship.

39:15.357 --> 39:17.974
The God of Justice must be blind!

39:18.107 --> 39:19.268
What did you say?

39:19.399 --> 39:21.640
She said thank goodness he came back.

39:21.774 --> 39:23.390
That's obviously not what she said.

39:23.524 --> 39:26.141
But, thank you all the same.

39:26.899 --> 39:28.481
You're welcome.

39:29.732 --> 39:30.563
What are you doing?

39:30.691 --> 39:32.648
I'm taking it back to China!

39:32.774 --> 39:33.764
This is my home,

39:33.899 --> 39:35.731
you can't just take anything you want!

39:35.857 --> 39:37.768
Just like over a hundred years ago,

39:37.899 --> 39:41.142
your ancestors didn't ask for permission
before taking this

39:41.816 --> 39:42.726
Coco

39:46.732 --> 39:48.222
Coco

39:48.357 --> 39:50.348
These things happened so long ago.

39:50.482 --> 39:53.395
Back then, if a woman
wore too little clothes,

39:53.524 --> 39:55.731
someone might throw a stone at you,

39:55.857 --> 39:58.144
no, at her.

39:58.691 --> 39:59.931
Oh, sorry.

40:00.066 --> 40:01.147
Sorry for what?

40:01.274 --> 40:02.560
Don't be a bleeding heart.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.648
She should be the one apologizing.

40:04.774 --> 40:06.060
What did she say?

40:06.191 --> 40:07.727
Did she say something?

40:08.316 --> 40:10.148
I don't need you to translate.

40:10.691 --> 40:12.398
Did you all forget?

40:12.524 --> 40:14.731
They came to our country a century ago,

40:14.857 --> 40:17.724
burned, raped, murdered and pillaged.

40:17.857 --> 40:20.440
Over a century ago,

40:20.566 --> 40:23.479
you came to our country to rape,

40:23.607 --> 40:25.644
pillage and murder.

40:25.774 --> 40:27.105
Even a hundred years later,

40:27.232 --> 40:30.224
these memories still hurt the Chinese!

40:33.149 --> 40:34.480
It's true.

40:35.024 --> 40:38.892
I studied history. Whatever the excuses

40:39.024 --> 40:40.435
I studied history.

40:40.566 --> 40:42.807
Whatever the excuses used,

40:42.941 --> 40:45.182
these things did indeed happen.

40:45.941 --> 40:50.310
Sometimes we can only explain
such things with invalid reasons, such as

40:51.191 --> 40:54.058
That was an era in which might makes right.

40:54.191 --> 40:56.182
We cannot use today's civilized standards

40:56.316 --> 40:58.353
to judge the mistakes of the past.

40:58.482 --> 41:00.940
Even now, it's the strong
who comes up on top.

41:01.066 --> 41:04.388
You must have power
before others will reason with you.

41:04.524 --> 41:07.141
Never mind. I'm beginning
to understand her point of view.

41:08.607 --> 41:10.018
Sorry.

41:11.107 --> 41:13.690
Anyway, all of this now
belongs to the bank.

41:13.816 --> 41:15.102
They're worthless to me.

41:15.232 --> 41:16.973
I'd give them to you if I could.

41:17.107 --> 41:19.018
Didn't you want to visit this castle?

41:19.149 --> 41:20.230
Now that we are here,

41:20.357 --> 41:21.939
let's stay for a couple of days.

41:22.066 --> 41:23.602
Come on, have some tea.

41:23.732 --> 41:24.938
Since you're so fond of each other,

41:25.066 --> 41:26.648
have fun yourselves!

41:28.149 --> 41:29.810
She is going to the bathroom.

41:38.982 --> 41:39.482
What is it?

41:39.607 --> 41:40.768
Come take a look.

41:46.274 --> 41:47.890
- Catherine!
- Yes?

41:48.024 --> 41:50.561
Your great grandfather, the ship...

41:50.691 --> 41:52.773
did it sink, or was it grounded?

41:52.899 --> 41:54.481
Who knows?

41:54.607 --> 41:57.770
You know what? We're interested

41:57.899 --> 42:00.687
about recovering your great grandfather.

42:00.816 --> 42:02.602
If we stay another couple of days,

42:02.732 --> 42:04.814
start an investigation, more information,

42:04.941 --> 42:05.726
we might be able to help.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.313
Thank you so much! It's wonderful.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.602
We have plenty of rooms here.

42:08.732 --> 42:10.053
You can stay as long as you wish.

42:10.149 --> 42:11.184
I'm going to make the preparation.

42:11.316 --> 42:12.852
But he may not be alive.

42:12.982 --> 42:14.347
It's okay.

42:15.441 --> 42:16.556
Coco.

42:17.732 --> 42:19.518
Thank you. I will call you later.

42:19.649 --> 42:20.764
Thanks for your help.

42:20.899 --> 42:22.014
Thank you.

42:22.149 --> 42:24.231
Let's stay and steal the Rooster-head.

42:24.357 --> 42:25.392
No stealing!

42:25.524 --> 42:27.481
As guests here, we mustn't steal.

42:27.607 --> 42:29.393
Who says we can't?

42:29.524 --> 42:31.106
They stole from us.

42:31.232 --> 42:34.520
We're just retrieving, not stealing.

42:34.649 --> 42:35.309
Good point!

42:35.441 --> 42:37.273
We need a replica to do the switch.

42:37.399 --> 42:39.731
But we don't have data to make one.

42:40.357 --> 42:42.064
Professor Guan has them.

42:42.191 --> 42:42.896
I'll ask him.

42:43.024 --> 42:44.264
Great! Hurry up!

43:02.816 --> 43:03.396
<i>Here!</i>

43:03.524 --> 43:04.514
<i>Data?</i>

43:10.691 --> 43:11.601
<i>Hello.</i>

43:17.566 --> 43:19.432
<i>Wee wee This way, Madam.</i>

43:19.566 --> 43:20.772
<i>Thank you!</i>

43:39.316 --> 43:40.101
<i>Thank you!</i>

43:40.857 --> 43:42.063
<i>Bye!</i>

43:49.316 --> 43:50.272
<i>Genius!</i>

44:19.982 --> 44:21.939
<i>What are these fools doing here?</i>

44:22.066 --> 44:23.181
<i>Launch picnic?</i>

44:24.066 --> 44:26.307
<i>They're now our lunch!</i>

44:46.208 --> 44:50.208
<i>Mom and dad, when can we go on holiday?</i>

44:51.316 --> 44:52.056
Look!

44:52.774 --> 44:54.890
<i>This is the data captured
by our mini-plane.</i>

45:04.107 --> 45:05.313
How is it?

45:21.441 --> 45:23.023
No wonder it's not on the map!

45:23.816 --> 45:25.227
Bingo!

45:25.357 --> 45:27.098
He was here when he drew this.

45:27.232 --> 45:28.722
You guys are amazing!

45:28.857 --> 45:30.268
No, technology is.

45:30.399 --> 45:31.935
What shall we do next?

45:32.066 --> 45:33.431
We'll camp here.

45:34.274 --> 45:36.231
Voice mail? Oh, forget it

45:36.899 --> 45:37.855
Martin.

45:37.982 --> 45:39.848
News said three heads were auctioned.

45:40.691 --> 45:41.476
Impossible!

45:41.607 --> 45:43.644
Why not? I'll show you.

45:43.774 --> 45:44.935
No signal.

45:45.066 --> 45:46.101
They must be fakes!

45:46.232 --> 45:48.815
We've got the real ones. Right?

45:48.941 --> 45:51.182
If fakes could fetch a fortune,

45:51.816 --> 45:52.601
how much will the real ones worth?

45:52.732 --> 45:54.188
They must be priceless!

45:54.316 --> 45:55.477
And now a word of advice.

45:55.607 --> 45:57.518
Don't change with the lights on.

45:57.649 --> 45:58.480
Why not?

45:58.607 --> 45:59.722
Look.

45:59.857 --> 46:00.597
Just now I was

46:00.732 --> 46:02.063
I didn't see anything.

46:02.649 --> 46:03.935
Honest!

46:04.691 --> 46:06.147
We saw nothing.

46:06.274 --> 46:07.764
Don't turn on the satellite receiver.

46:12.732 --> 46:14.143
What? Lizard!

46:15.107 --> 46:16.347
It's just a lizard.

46:16.482 --> 46:17.438
Where are you going?

46:17.566 --> 46:18.306
I'm going up.

46:18.441 --> 46:19.897
But JC

46:20.941 --> 46:22.682
But JC told us not to move.

46:22.816 --> 46:23.726
Do as you like.

46:23.857 --> 46:24.847
Wait for me!

46:24.982 --> 46:25.482
How long?

46:25.524 --> 46:26.605
NOW!

46:27.357 --> 46:28.347
Look at you.

46:28.482 --> 46:30.348
What? It's just my make-up bag!

46:30.482 --> 46:31.847
Whatever.

46:35.482 --> 46:36.563
What's wrong with you two?

46:36.691 --> 46:37.601
Still in a stand-off.

46:37.732 --> 46:41.145
If it is not for my child,
I'd have left him long ago.

46:41.274 --> 46:42.184
What about you?

46:42.316 --> 46:43.716
She is still not answering my call.

46:43.816 --> 46:46.057
I was only three days
late for her birthday.

46:46.191 --> 46:47.852
Why so mad about it?

46:48.941 --> 46:50.431
Where are you going?

46:50.566 --> 46:51.852
This way.

46:51.982 --> 46:53.017
How do you know?

46:53.149 --> 46:54.765
Instinct!

46:54.899 --> 46:56.685
Whatever.

46:56.816 --> 46:57.396
Oh my god!

46:57.524 --> 46:58.355
The trees on this island,

46:58.482 --> 47:01.395
must be kept secret from those lumberjacks.

47:01.524 --> 47:02.645
If not, none will be spared.

47:02.774 --> 47:04.185
Now you're very happy.

47:04.316 --> 47:05.647
Know how hard I've been trying?

47:05.774 --> 47:08.607
Have you considered other options?

47:08.732 --> 47:10.723
No one could tolerate her tantrum!

47:10.857 --> 47:12.268
See who leaves first.

47:13.066 --> 47:15.558
What's with Valentine's Day and the rest?

47:15.691 --> 47:16.396
Where did they come from?

47:16.524 --> 47:18.356
Does it matter whose idea they were?

47:18.482 --> 47:19.313
It's important

47:19.441 --> 47:20.977
you're there when she needs you.

47:21.107 --> 47:22.723
Then who brings home the bread?

47:22.857 --> 47:24.598
You men just don't understand women!

47:26.482 --> 47:27.688
Over there!

47:29.274 --> 47:30.560
It's Coco!

47:31.066 --> 47:32.602
<i>I told them not to run around.</i>

47:32.732 --> 47:34.097
<i>Catherine!</i>

47:34.232 --> 47:35.814
<i>Coming! We're coming!</i>

47:35.941 --> 47:37.397
<i>Help us!</i>

47:37.524 --> 47:38.355
<i>Hold on!</i>

47:38.482 --> 47:39.722
Look at yourself! Help me!

47:39.857 --> 47:41.939
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

47:43.357 --> 47:45.769
Hold on!

48:01.274 --> 48:02.355
Trouble!

48:04.191 --> 48:04.896
What happened?

48:05.024 --> 48:06.389
They fell down a chasm!

48:07.566 --> 48:09.648
I told you to stay put!

48:10.399 --> 48:11.389
It's her fault!

48:11.524 --> 48:13.982
Say something I understand in English!

48:14.607 --> 48:15.688
Purple

48:16.607 --> 48:17.972
Panty!

48:21.274 --> 48:22.605
Hold tight!

48:27.899 --> 48:31.346
Purple is my favorite color!

48:31.482 --> 48:33.473
You came dressed for a picnic?

48:33.607 --> 48:35.063
Don't tell me how to dress!

48:35.191 --> 48:36.101
What happened to your instinct?

48:36.232 --> 48:39.020
Girls, we haven't landed yet!

48:39.149 --> 48:42.107
JC, where's your hand?

48:43.066 --> 48:45.182
Under your purple.

48:45.316 --> 48:45.896
Let go!

48:46.024 --> 48:47.310
You'll fall!

48:47.441 --> 48:48.647
Let go! I can hold on myself.

48:48.774 --> 48:49.684
You sure?

48:49.816 --> 48:51.181
I'm sure!

48:51.316 --> 48:52.477
Okay.

49:13.107 --> 49:14.973
Madam, you've landed.

49:16.232 --> 49:17.688
We're fine.

49:17.816 --> 49:19.352
But Coco is missing!

49:20.066 --> 49:22.228
JC is okay, but we've lost Coco.

49:23.524 --> 49:24.764
Give us the coordinates.

49:28.232 --> 49:29.939
- This way.
- Okay.

49:41.066 --> 49:42.272
Coco!

49:43.357 --> 49:44.722
Coco!

49:45.816 --> 49:46.931
I am over here...

49:47.066 --> 49:48.682
I found Coco!

49:48.816 --> 49:50.773
Ask captain to bring the first aid kit.

49:50.899 --> 49:52.355
Understood!

49:53.399 --> 49:54.514
Are you alright?

49:54.649 --> 49:55.434
My foot...

49:55.566 --> 49:56.681
Which foot?

49:58.774 --> 50:00.139
Don't move!

50:07.482 --> 50:08.722
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

50:08.732 --> 50:10.097
Your foot!

50:11.441 --> 50:13.102
Nothing, nothing.

50:19.524 --> 50:20.434
Snake!

50:21.524 --> 50:22.639
Where?

50:22.774 --> 50:23.639
Done!

50:23.774 --> 50:24.935
My foot...

50:25.066 --> 50:27.273
You dislocated your ankle. It's okay now.

50:29.149 --> 50:30.355
Over here.

50:33.857 --> 50:35.018
Simon.

50:35.607 --> 50:36.688
Look at these trees!

50:37.774 --> 50:39.264
Hacked by men.

50:43.149 --> 50:45.015
<i>I just saw cannons and cannonballs!</i>

50:45.607 --> 50:48.520
<i>This vessel looks like it's from that era!</i>

50:49.232 --> 50:52.020
<i>Could this be the Indestructible
we've been looking for?</i>

50:52.149 --> 50:53.890
<i>Very likely.</i>

50:55.274 --> 50:56.810
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

50:56.941 --> 50:58.397
<i>This chain rode...</i>

50:58.524 --> 51:00.106
<i>What is it doing here?</i>

51:02.316 --> 51:04.227
<i>It goes all the way into that tree!</i>

51:06.524 --> 51:08.390
<i>The Indestructible!</i>

51:08.524 --> 51:09.434
You've found it!

51:09.566 --> 51:11.682
No, we fell on it.

51:11.816 --> 51:13.181
How lucky.

51:14.691 --> 51:15.806
No way!

51:15.941 --> 51:17.431
It's for real!

51:21.482 --> 51:22.938
It's okay.

51:23.066 --> 51:24.727
<i>Just a tarantula.</i>

51:31.566 --> 51:35.389
JC, I found my great grandfather!

51:35.524 --> 51:36.685
What?

51:36.816 --> 51:38.602
You can tell from the bones?

51:38.732 --> 51:39.722
No, no. This ring.

51:39.857 --> 51:42.394
It has my family crest. I found it here.

51:43.524 --> 51:44.138
There are two!

51:44.274 --> 51:45.059
Which one?

51:45.191 --> 51:46.272
Instinct!

51:46.399 --> 51:47.810
- Quick.
- This one!

51:48.566 --> 51:49.351
Good!

51:49.482 --> 51:50.222
Are you sure?

51:50.357 --> 51:51.097
Sure.

51:51.232 --> 51:53.152
<i>I'll stuff your great grandfather
in my backpack.</i>

51:53.232 --> 51:53.892
<i>His arm.</i>

51:54.024 --> 51:56.015
<i>Oops Sorry!</i>

52:17.857 --> 52:18.767
JC

52:19.691 --> 52:21.773
We've found the Indestructible!

52:25.274 --> 52:27.891
<i>Who could've imagined,
at a place like this!</i>

52:28.024 --> 52:29.230
<i>How did you find it?</i>

52:29.357 --> 52:30.188
<i>Brilliant!</i>

52:30.316 --> 52:31.806
<i>We stumbled upon it.</i>

52:31.941 --> 52:33.397
<i>Almost broke our legs.</i>

52:34.232 --> 52:35.097
Found the bronze heads yet?

52:35.232 --> 52:36.438
We found one.

52:40.191 --> 52:42.228
Bonnie, I have the medical kit!

52:42.357 --> 52:44.769
<i>Go around! There is an old path!</i>

52:44.899 --> 52:46.230
<i>Just follow the marks we left!</i>

52:46.357 --> 52:47.893
Okay, I'm on my way!

52:48.024 --> 52:49.310
Thank you!

52:49.441 --> 52:51.273
This is the Indestructible?

52:51.399 --> 52:51.934
Yes.

52:52.066 --> 52:53.932
How did it end up here?

52:54.066 --> 52:54.680
Typhoon?

52:54.816 --> 52:56.147
Typhoon that powerful?

52:56.274 --> 52:56.854
Tsunami?

52:56.982 --> 52:57.813
Everything was possible.

52:57.941 --> 52:59.227
On our way here,

52:59.357 --> 53:01.143
we saw graves and skeletons.

53:01.899 --> 53:05.142
Those outside the cave
must belong to the crew.

53:05.274 --> 53:07.857
Judging on the decomposition
of those inside,

53:07.982 --> 53:10.223
they're different from the others.

53:10.357 --> 53:12.689
Some were stabbed, too.

53:12.816 --> 53:14.898
They must have fought before they died.

53:15.024 --> 53:17.732
Probably men brought by
her great grandfather.

53:17.857 --> 53:20.224
They didn't die from natural causes.

53:20.357 --> 53:23.065
They killed each another.

53:23.899 --> 53:26.937
Didn't her great-great
grandfather return home?

53:27.066 --> 53:28.773
Then what was his son looking for?

53:31.107 --> 53:33.769
Whatever the reason,
it doesn't matter anymore.

53:33.899 --> 53:34.809
You are right.

53:34.941 --> 53:38.104
It happened 150 years ago. Right?

53:38.649 --> 53:39.889
She understands Chinese?

53:40.024 --> 53:41.810
I told her the same thing just now.

53:41.941 --> 53:43.181
They killed each other?

53:43.316 --> 53:45.523
So his son came back to look for

53:45.649 --> 53:47.606
the spoils his father left behind?

53:47.732 --> 53:48.767
Right?

53:49.649 --> 53:51.139
- Right?
- Right.

53:51.274 --> 53:52.195
We need to take a leak!

53:52.316 --> 53:53.602
Right.

53:54.482 --> 53:55.472
Where are you going?

53:55.607 --> 53:56.312
Bathroom!

53:56.441 --> 53:56.941
All of you?

53:56.982 --> 53:58.564
Yeah! Wee wee

53:59.816 --> 54:02.274
My grandmother's going to be very happy.

54:02.399 --> 54:03.639
How is your foot?

54:07.524 --> 54:08.855
It goes downhill,

54:09.357 --> 54:11.018
with logs lined up all the way.

54:11.149 --> 54:12.981
No wonder so many trees had fallen.

54:13.899 --> 54:15.060
Don't do that!

54:15.191 --> 54:16.602
There is more.

54:16.732 --> 54:18.063
<i>Look over there!</i>

54:18.191 --> 54:19.556
<i>An enormous anchor!</i>

54:19.691 --> 54:22.763
<i>But why is it being hung on a tree?</i>

54:22.899 --> 54:25.732
It's a very clever lever device.

54:27.524 --> 54:29.891
<i>When the anchor descends,</i>

54:30.024 --> 54:31.264
the chain rode will ascend,

54:31.399 --> 54:34.312
and sends the trunk
downhill via the pulley.

54:35.357 --> 54:38.224
No wonder there isn't a single pulley
on the ship!

54:38.357 --> 54:42.225
How we benefit from our ancestors' wisdom!

54:43.024 --> 54:44.890
You don't seem excited.

54:45.024 --> 54:45.684
I am wrecking my brain

54:45.816 --> 54:47.978
on how to take this trunk back with us?

54:49.107 --> 54:50.723
If this trunk...

54:50.857 --> 54:52.973
There are no ifs.

54:55.607 --> 54:57.644
Money! Money! Money!

54:57.774 --> 54:59.890
JC, the medical kit

55:00.482 --> 55:01.813
and your friend is here.

55:02.232 --> 55:03.438
Hey. JC!

55:03.566 --> 55:06.103
I'm very happy to see you again.

55:07.316 --> 55:10.513
My friend, it's a big surprise.

55:16.024 --> 55:17.230
Pierre?

55:17.649 --> 55:18.889
Catherine!

55:19.024 --> 55:20.890
Address me as miss! You're ridiculous!

55:21.024 --> 55:21.764
Shut up!

55:21.899 --> 55:23.515
You're not in your castle anymore.

55:24.607 --> 55:26.939
I knew you were working together.

55:27.066 --> 55:29.683
I've been following you
since you met Catherine.

55:29.816 --> 55:32.729
Give me the painting
and the other things you stole.

55:32.857 --> 55:35.315
You think I'd bring everything
to this island?

55:36.107 --> 55:37.689
It's a great place!

55:38.232 --> 55:41.520
There's no one else. Just us!

55:42.024 --> 55:45.096
I could kill you now,
and nobody would know.

55:46.482 --> 55:47.472
Ready!

55:47.607 --> 55:48.972
Pierre!

55:53.357 --> 55:54.518
Are you alright?

55:54.649 --> 55:57.391
Idiots! These guns are not loaded!

55:57.524 --> 55:58.264
It wasn't us! We didn't do anything!

55:58.399 --> 56:01.232
It's okay! No bullets!

56:01.357 --> 56:02.392
So who fired?

56:02.524 --> 56:04.125
- You guys are impossible.
- Don't move!

56:04.232 --> 56:06.143
Or I'll blow your heads off

56:07.441 --> 56:08.181
Pirates?

56:08.316 --> 56:09.477
Yep! Bingo!

56:10.107 --> 56:12.394
<i>If you don't do what I say,</i>

56:12.524 --> 56:13.810
<i>I'll kill you all!</i>

56:16.191 --> 56:18.603
If we work together, we can beat them.

56:21.899 --> 56:25.062
We've been here for a long time.

56:25.191 --> 56:28.263
Only now do we know this place.

56:28.982 --> 56:31.144
Welcome to my island, my friends!

56:31.274 --> 56:32.935
We're reasonable men.

56:33.066 --> 56:35.228
All we want is your money.

56:36.066 --> 56:38.524
Squat! Hurry up! Understand?

56:38.649 --> 56:40.936
Don't do anything stupid and no one

56:41.066 --> 56:43.103
gets hurt!

56:44.357 --> 56:47.224
<i>The ransom is $500,000 each.</i>

56:47.357 --> 56:49.815
<i>Do what you need to do.</i>

56:49.941 --> 56:51.272
<i>Bravo!</i>

56:51.399 --> 56:53.231
<i>Or we can feed you to the sharks!</i>

56:53.357 --> 56:54.688
<i>Bravo!</i>

56:54.816 --> 56:57.604
<i>I don't mind keeping the women, though.</i>

56:57.732 --> 56:59.598
<i>Bravo!</i>

56:59.732 --> 57:01.063
Let me tell you something.

57:01.191 --> 57:03.057
We are not with them.

57:03.191 --> 57:06.058
My boss would be happy to get you
any money you want.

57:06.191 --> 57:07.272
He's very rich.

57:07.399 --> 57:10.107
Those guys want to fight you but I said no!

57:12.232 --> 57:13.518
Take them away!

57:13.649 --> 57:15.014
Thank you!

57:15.649 --> 57:17.640
So what are you doing on my island?

57:19.691 --> 57:20.681
It's my hat!

57:23.066 --> 57:24.932
Tell me. What are you doing here?

57:25.066 --> 57:26.101
Don't understand.

57:26.232 --> 57:27.393
Mandarin?

57:29.774 --> 57:31.890
Boss asked what were you doing here?

57:34.857 --> 57:36.268
Barbecue.

57:36.899 --> 57:38.230
What did you say?

57:38.357 --> 57:40.143
This is a metal detector.

57:41.024 --> 57:42.514
Barbecue? With this?

57:42.649 --> 57:44.265
What were you doing with this?

57:44.399 --> 57:45.981
Mini microwave.

57:47.691 --> 57:49.807
Do you think I'm stupid?!

57:49.941 --> 57:52.524
This is a metal detector.

57:52.649 --> 57:54.105
What are you looking for?

57:55.982 --> 57:58.519
You don't want to tell me?

57:58.649 --> 58:00.435
I'll find out.

58:00.566 --> 58:01.601
Take the girls.

58:01.732 --> 58:02.813
Hands off!

58:04.566 --> 58:05.727
Lie down!

58:29.024 --> 58:30.139
What the

58:30.274 --> 58:31.314
I didn't pull the trigger!

58:31.357 --> 58:32.313
Take care of those at one o'clock!

58:32.441 --> 58:33.431
Okay!

58:37.857 --> 58:39.518
Boss! Are you okay?

58:40.816 --> 58:42.056
Don't move!

58:53.607 --> 58:55.473
I forget to tell you. No bullets.

58:56.607 --> 58:58.598
If we stay calm, nothing will happen to us.

58:58.732 --> 58:59.346
Yes!

59:03.649 --> 59:04.605
Stop him from getting the gun!

59:04.732 --> 59:05.597
Okay!

59:23.607 --> 59:24.392
Captain!

59:24.524 --> 59:25.309
Hurry! This way!

59:25.899 --> 59:27.014
Come on!

59:27.941 --> 59:28.851
Twelve o'clock

59:40.649 --> 59:41.184
What should we do now, boss?

59:41.316 --> 59:42.397
Let's get out of here!

59:44.482 --> 59:47.019
Mother of Mercy, I'm scared!

01:00:02.024 --> 01:00:03.014
Snake-head?

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:28.851
Catch it!

01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:38.014
My foot!

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:44.976
My great grandfather!

01:00:45.107 --> 01:00:45.812
No, no, no!

01:00:47.149 --> 01:00:48.480
My great grandfather!

01:00:48.899 --> 01:00:50.389
No, no, no!

01:00:50.524 --> 01:00:53.186
No! My great grandfather!

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.853
No, no, no!

01:01:07.024 --> 01:01:07.980
Sorry!

01:01:08.107 --> 01:01:09.063
It's okay.

01:01:09.191 --> 01:01:11.398
My great grandfather! Thank you.

01:01:11.524 --> 01:01:13.060
Girls, let's go!

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:15.102
My foot! My shoe!

01:01:15.232 --> 01:01:16.722
My great grandfather!

01:01:20.982 --> 01:01:22.143
Go! Come on!

01:01:28.357 --> 01:01:29.142
Hurry!

01:01:29.274 --> 01:01:30.309
Run!

01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:31.772
- What's up?
- It's okay.

01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:34.231
It's okay. What are you doing?

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:36.147
Over here.

01:01:36.274 --> 01:01:38.891
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

01:01:40.274 --> 01:01:41.764
My foot...

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:42.399
Run!

01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:43.364
- You first.
- Okay.

01:01:43.441 --> 01:01:43.646
Go!

01:01:43.774 --> 01:01:44.684
I've lost my shoe!

01:01:44.816 --> 01:01:46.181
Go!

01:01:48.232 --> 01:01:49.272
- Let me help.
- My foot!

01:01:49.274 --> 01:01:50.685
Come on. Put this on!

01:01:51.232 --> 01:01:53.644
Catch it!

01:01:54.732 --> 01:01:56.188
It's the Snake-head!

01:01:56.316 --> 01:01:57.237
You go with them first!

01:01:57.357 --> 01:01:57.957
What about you?

01:01:58.024 --> 01:01:59.389
- Meet you by the trunk!
- OK!

01:02:00.982 --> 01:02:02.222
There's something in the shoe.

01:02:06.649 --> 01:02:07.639
Take it!

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:16.681
Catch it!

01:02:17.941 --> 01:02:19.022
Any more?

01:02:19.816 --> 01:02:20.897
Don't move!

01:02:21.024 --> 01:02:23.015
This gun has bullets.

01:02:24.357 --> 01:02:25.097
Quick!

01:02:28.607 --> 01:02:29.312
Help me!

01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:30.101
Come on!

01:02:30.232 --> 01:02:31.142
I count to three!

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:34.389
One!

01:02:34.524 --> 01:02:35.184
Two!

01:02:44.232 --> 01:02:44.972
You've only found one?

01:02:45.107 --> 01:02:46.393
I've only lived once!

01:03:10.982 --> 01:03:11.892
Are they all dead?

01:03:12.024 --> 01:03:12.980
Run!

01:03:20.107 --> 01:03:21.848
Don't move! Hands up!

01:03:26.774 --> 01:03:28.230
Don't give it to me!

01:03:28.357 --> 01:03:29.597
My hat

01:03:32.149 --> 01:03:34.356
I'm done with being reasonable!

01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:37.515
Barbecue this, smart guy!

01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:14.227
Don't move!

01:04:28.649 --> 01:04:30.289
- Are you okay?
- None of your business.

01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:32.313
Go!

01:04:32.441 --> 01:04:33.522
This way!

01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:35.809
Hurry Up!

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:36.806
Go!

01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:37.976
Are you alright?

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:39.522
Hold this!

01:04:40.357 --> 01:04:42.519
Sheep head? JC

01:04:45.607 --> 01:04:46.722
Come on!

01:04:54.274 --> 01:04:55.560
We are so lucky!

01:04:58.399 --> 01:05:00.060
My foot...

01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:01.101
it really hurts!

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:03.310
A bone

01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:08.227
Coco! Are you okay?

01:05:08.357 --> 01:05:09.097
Gold!

01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:10.063
How do you know about the gold?

01:05:10.191 --> 01:05:10.896
It fell out.

01:05:11.024 --> 01:05:12.544
You knew about the gold in this trunk?

01:05:12.649 --> 01:05:13.730
I didn't say trunk!

01:05:13.857 --> 01:05:15.393
Let me see. It's from my boot.

01:05:15.524 --> 01:05:17.106
Is there gold in this trunk?

01:05:18.149 --> 01:05:20.516
Say something in English! /
I've found it!

01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:22.851
Pack it!

01:05:22.982 --> 01:05:23.596
It's changed!

01:05:23.732 --> 01:05:24.722
Where is the Snake-head?

01:05:28.649 --> 01:05:30.105
The Dragon-head must be in there!

01:05:30.524 --> 01:05:31.685
You go!

01:05:31.816 --> 01:05:32.476
Forget it!

01:05:32.607 --> 01:05:34.143
English!

01:05:34.274 --> 01:05:36.766
How can we get out of here?

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:37.980
One Way!

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:41.764
Sit tight! What are you doing?

01:05:43.399 --> 01:05:44.605
Don't move!

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.682
Watch out for my hand. I am super accurate!

01:05:48.399 --> 01:05:49.389
Accurate what!

01:05:49.524 --> 01:05:50.605
I'll do it!

01:05:51.316 --> 01:05:52.556
Watch out for my hand.

01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:54.728
Captain! Go southeast!

01:05:56.024 --> 01:05:57.810
The road ends here.

01:05:59.107 --> 01:06:00.097
This way!

01:06:03.066 --> 01:06:04.101
It's almost done.

01:06:04.232 --> 01:06:05.097
Get ready!

01:06:05.232 --> 01:06:06.688
One, two, three

01:06:15.024 --> 01:06:16.105
It's stuck!

01:06:17.524 --> 01:06:18.059
What is going on?

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:19.306
No time to explain!

01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:25.681
Here they come!

01:06:37.316 --> 01:06:38.556
You've got nowhere to go!

01:06:38.691 --> 01:06:40.181
Come on, don't shoot!

01:06:40.316 --> 01:06:40.976
Come on!

01:06:41.566 --> 01:06:42.180
Scarf!

01:06:42.316 --> 01:06:43.397
Scarf! Hurry!

01:06:45.649 --> 01:06:47.014
Put them on! Put it!

01:06:47.524 --> 01:06:48.559
Wear them well!

01:06:48.691 --> 01:06:49.556
Simon!

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:51.435
Put this on!

01:06:53.774 --> 01:06:55.560
Treat them honey!

01:06:57.357 --> 01:06:59.143
I told you!

01:07:06.441 --> 01:07:08.307
Fire in the hole!

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.181
Can you manage?

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:11.523
You do it!

01:07:11.649 --> 01:07:12.980
I'll do it!

01:07:25.232 --> 01:07:26.518
The bees are homing in!

01:07:28.149 --> 01:07:29.890
Smoke bombs!

01:07:44.232 --> 01:07:45.347
Quick! Get on quickly!

01:08:16.482 --> 01:08:18.143
Stop! You stupid!

01:08:18.274 --> 01:08:20.310
It doesn't matter! Let 'em go!

01:08:24.024 --> 01:08:27.062
We still have five.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.104
The bees are not so friendly.

01:08:33.232 --> 01:08:33.767
Why You guys are okay?

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:34.979
No! No! No!

01:08:35.107 --> 01:08:35.707
Call your boss!

01:08:35.732 --> 01:08:37.348
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:09:05.982 --> 01:09:08.314
- Everybody okay?
- Okay!

01:09:08.441 --> 01:09:10.057
Money!

Everybody okay?

01:09:30.691 --> 01:09:31.897
Okay!

01:09:32.024 --> 01:09:33.310
Everybody okay?

01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:34.397
Okay.

01:09:34.524 --> 01:09:36.231
You lost your great grandfather

01:09:36.357 --> 01:09:36.857
It's okay!

01:09:36.982 --> 01:09:38.643
It's okay. He loved the sea.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:45.687
Here! Here

01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:57.057
Hey guys! Here!

01:09:59.357 --> 01:10:01.189
<i>The trunk is 1.3m in diameter and 7m long.</i>

01:10:01.316 --> 01:10:03.796
<i>Its cylindrical volume is
about 9.28 million cubic centimeters.</i>

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:05.060
<i>Based on its relative weight,</i>

01:10:05.191 --> 01:10:07.591
<i>and the fact that it still floats,
about 1/22 should be gold.</i>

01:10:07.607 --> 01:10:08.972
<i>Divide that by the size of each gold bar,</i>

01:10:09.107 --> 01:10:09.596
<i>inside this trunk... My butt hurts!</i>

01:10:09.732 --> 01:10:11.143
<i>There are 2,900 pieces of gold.</i>

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:13.311
<i>Multiply that by the density of gold,</i>

01:10:13.441 --> 01:10:15.478
There are eight tons!

01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:16.771
So much?

01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:17.659
A ton of gold each!

01:10:17.774 --> 01:10:18.855
What about the two excess tons?

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:20.347
Divide them into eight parts.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.563
What about the two excess parts?

01:10:21.691 --> 01:10:22.522
They are yours.

01:10:22.649 --> 01:10:23.184
Why him?

01:10:23.316 --> 01:10:24.272
I just feel like it.

01:10:24.399 --> 01:10:26.640
This is why they
slaughtered one another.

01:10:26.774 --> 01:10:28.606
No way, we don't even quarrel!

01:10:28.732 --> 01:10:29.688
What's the result?

01:10:29.816 --> 01:10:31.181
Eight tons! Maybe more!

01:10:32.107 --> 01:10:33.893
Let's celebrate! Let's go outside!

01:10:34.024 --> 01:10:36.607
One word for this journey: Romantic!

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:37.893
Thrilling!

01:10:38.024 --> 01:10:39.355
Rewarding!

01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:41.355
Intriguing!

01:10:41.482 --> 01:10:42.972
Satisfying!

01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:14.398
<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

01:11:14.524 --> 01:11:16.936
I know you are there.

01:11:17.066 --> 01:11:18.352
Stop sulking on your own.

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.564
Pick up the phone and bawl me out.

01:11:21.941 --> 01:11:22.305
Got to go.

01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:24.728
Can't you ever have a proper conversation?

01:11:24.857 --> 01:11:26.973
We start off nice and calm every time,

01:11:27.107 --> 01:11:28.723
but always end up having a row.

01:11:28.857 --> 01:11:30.018
- Morning!
- Morning!

01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:31.514
Thanks for your help last night!

01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:32.559
Don't mention it.

01:11:32.691 --> 01:11:34.398
Your medicine

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:37.107
Don't you guys have a confession to make?

01:11:37.232 --> 01:11:38.017
Like what?

01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:39.560
Good morning, everybody!

01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:40.852
Stay here!

01:11:40.982 --> 01:11:43.940
Last night I wrote a
poem to thank all of you

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.556
for what you've done for me.

01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:46.772
Coco, can you translate?

01:11:46.899 --> 01:11:48.060
Okay.

01:11:48.816 --> 01:11:51.774
The oppressed rescued by brave knights

01:11:51.899 --> 01:11:54.732
A bunch of lying scoundrels in real life

01:11:55.316 --> 01:11:56.272
What?

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:59.721
They set sail for a hazardous journey

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:01.313
Driven by greed

01:12:01.441 --> 01:12:03.648
they embarked on a stealthy voyage

01:12:03.774 --> 01:12:06.812
with hearts pure, righteous, fearless

01:12:06.941 --> 01:12:08.852
and without self interest.

01:12:08.982 --> 01:12:10.973
Heaven will be your judge.

01:12:11.107 --> 01:12:14.554
Stealing national treasure is despicable.

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:18.732
Their generosity will be rewarded.

01:12:18.857 --> 01:12:20.518
You may evade the judgment of law,

01:12:20.649 --> 01:12:22.560
but never escape your own conscience.

01:12:22.691 --> 01:12:23.681
God bless you.

01:12:23.816 --> 01:12:25.398
Ask yourselves every new year's eve,

01:12:25.524 --> 01:12:27.515
did I steal next year's zodiac animal head?

01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:29.560
Even all the riches in the world,

01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:31.853
won't buy you any peace of mind.

01:12:31.982 --> 01:12:34.349
Chinese is so long!

01:12:34.482 --> 01:12:35.813
That was God bless you?

01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:36.931
Yes.

01:12:37.066 --> 01:12:39.273
Are you sure the translation was correct?

01:12:39.399 --> 01:12:40.935
Was I right?

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.730
We like it.

01:12:43.857 --> 01:12:44.357
I like it.

01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:45.889
We like it.

01:12:46.691 --> 01:12:48.147
What are you trying to say?

01:12:48.274 --> 01:12:49.890
You always meant to look for gold.

01:12:50.024 --> 01:12:52.061
You even brought metal detectors.

01:12:52.482 --> 01:12:54.894
Gold or bronze, we need metal detectors.

01:12:55.024 --> 01:12:55.980
Liars!

01:12:57.524 --> 01:13:00.186
You're gunning for these gold from day one!

01:13:02.482 --> 01:13:04.598
How could you rummage through my room?

01:13:04.732 --> 01:13:05.563
Stop being a jerk.

01:13:05.691 --> 01:13:08.809
I saw these
when I helped you back to your cabin.

01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:10.272
Oh, dolphins!

01:13:11.191 --> 01:13:12.352
Whales, too!

01:13:12.482 --> 01:13:13.938
Crocodiles!

01:13:14.066 --> 01:13:15.682
- Crocodiles in open sea?
- Let's go.

01:13:16.399 --> 01:13:17.480
They swim, don't they?

01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:20.432
You really work well as a team!

01:13:21.357 --> 01:13:23.974
Okay, then. Fire away

01:13:24.107 --> 01:13:26.769
You're not even Martin Shangguan.

01:13:27.191 --> 01:13:28.147
Correct.

01:13:28.274 --> 01:13:30.060
You weren't looking
for Catherine's great grandfather.

01:13:30.191 --> 01:13:32.398
You came for the gold and the bronze heads!

01:13:32.524 --> 01:13:34.060
You could say that.

01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:37.309
You'll auction off each
recovered bronze head.

01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:38.181
Right.

01:13:38.316 --> 01:13:40.478
What do you plan to do with these?

01:13:41.274 --> 01:13:42.890
Someone will pick them up
when we reach port.

01:13:43.024 --> 01:13:45.231
I thought they're for the Chinese people!

01:13:45.357 --> 01:13:47.018
You're just a mercenary!

01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:48.605
There are relics all over the world.

01:13:48.732 --> 01:13:50.598
Why can't we profit a little from them?

01:13:50.732 --> 01:13:51.893
You feel no shame?

01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:53.810
It's a matter of national dignity!

01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:55.056
These battered heads...

01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:56.681
have nothing to do with dignity

01:13:56.816 --> 01:13:59.228
They represent centuries of
our cultural heritage!

01:13:59.357 --> 01:14:00.893
What's the big deal?

01:14:01.024 --> 01:14:02.480
China is thousands of years old.

01:14:02.607 --> 01:14:04.723
What we could achieve then,
we can do better now.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.143
What's going on?

01:14:06.274 --> 01:14:08.356
Boy-girl problem. Come on.

01:14:08.482 --> 01:14:10.598
If you like,
I can get someone to make you a dozen.

01:14:10.732 --> 01:14:12.348
From every dynasty

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:13.768
Scoundrel!

01:14:13.899 --> 01:14:15.014
What, me?

01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:17.311
From your first day with Professor Guan,

01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:18.772
you have been using us!

01:14:18.899 --> 01:14:19.639
Young lady

01:14:19.774 --> 01:14:21.560
don't pretend you're holier than me.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:23.477
We didn't ask you to come along.

01:14:23.607 --> 01:14:24.392
And

01:14:24.524 --> 01:14:26.140
if a fish doesn't open its mouth,
it can't take a bite!

01:14:26.274 --> 01:14:27.355
It's take the bait!

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.689
Being a cheat is nothing to be proud of.

01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:34.932
Your victims are those who trusted you.

01:14:35.066 --> 01:14:36.682
We've been doing this
long before we met you.

01:14:36.816 --> 01:14:37.816
I don't care what you do.

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:40.103
But if you wrong your family
and fellow countrymen,

01:14:40.232 --> 01:14:42.394
your children will forever live in shame.

01:14:42.524 --> 01:14:44.014
Stop the boat!

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:47.556
What is it?

01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:49.435
The gold!

01:14:58.899 --> 01:14:59.419
What's wrong?

01:14:59.482 --> 01:14:59.982
Nothing!

01:15:00.024 --> 01:15:01.230
Stabilize the boat!

01:15:22.982 --> 01:15:24.063
How could this happen?

01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.773
It was alright just now.

01:15:25.899 --> 01:15:26.889
The gold is too heavy,

01:15:27.024 --> 01:15:28.310
and the trunk has been
soaking for too long.

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:29.055
They just fell off.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.681
I thought you had it all worked out!

01:15:30.816 --> 01:15:32.102
You didn't do it right.

01:15:32.232 --> 01:15:33.848
You tied the rope to the wrong end!

01:15:33.982 --> 01:15:34.892
It's your fault!

01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:35.809
Me?

01:15:35.941 --> 01:15:37.557
Shut up! It's your responsibility!

01:15:37.691 --> 01:15:39.807
It isn't the fault of any one person.

01:15:40.316 --> 01:15:42.182
We could return and salvage it later.

01:15:42.316 --> 01:15:42.930
Right.

01:15:43.066 --> 01:15:44.101
Salvage my ass!

01:15:44.232 --> 01:15:46.724
Everything belongs to the
pirates around here!

01:15:46.857 --> 01:15:49.269
Consider this travel fee...

01:15:49.399 --> 01:15:53.063
Pirates in this area are
from seven nations.

01:15:53.191 --> 01:15:54.773
Enough! Knock it off!

01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:56.435
If this is any consolation,

01:15:56.566 --> 01:15:57.897
I still have one here.

01:15:58.024 --> 01:16:00.516
Whoever needs money can have it.

01:16:02.774 --> 01:16:04.640
You are luckier than her great-grandfather.

01:16:04.774 --> 01:16:06.685
At least you won't go home empty-handed.

01:16:07.524 --> 01:16:08.764
True.

01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:11.766
Someone did once try to take them home.

01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:14.391
Still these gold remain on Mother Earth.

01:16:14.524 --> 01:16:16.561
Seven groups of pirates
now watch over them.

01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:18.307
Safer than in a bank vault!

01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:21.274
Let's leave them here undisturbed.

01:16:30.982 --> 01:16:32.848
Mark the coordinates. Hurry!

01:16:33.982 --> 01:16:34.596
It's gone!

01:16:34.732 --> 01:16:35.847
What? What?!

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:37.097
Where has it gone?

01:16:37.232 --> 01:16:37.992
Get into the water?

01:16:38.107 --> 01:16:39.393
You can't get into the water to get it?

01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:40.810
You go get it.

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:51.722
Professor Guan,

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:54.058
Professor Guan, please come
and assist our investigation

01:16:54.066 --> 01:16:55.352
on the theft of the bronze heads' data.

01:16:55.482 --> 01:16:57.598
Just follow my instructions,

01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:03.433
<i>Today, the sale of a bronze rams' head
and a bronze snake's head</i>

01:17:03.566 --> 01:17:06.149
<i>has set a new record
at an art auction in London.</i>

01:17:06.274 --> 01:17:09.471
<i>The last one, the dragon,
is expected to sell for even more.</i>

01:17:09.607 --> 01:17:12.850
<i>The sale of the bronze heads
has provoked much controversy.</i>

01:17:12.982 --> 01:17:17.601
<i>Calls for repatriation of relics
are intensifying.</i>

01:17:18.107 --> 01:17:19.973
<i>We don't want our patriotic sentiment</i>

01:17:20.107 --> 01:17:20.892
<i>to be hijacked by others.</i>

01:17:21.024 --> 01:17:24.062
<i>We appreciate the young
for expressing their views.</i>

01:17:24.191 --> 01:17:25.431
<i>The auctioning of historical relics
from illegal sources,</i>

01:17:25.566 --> 01:17:27.773
<i>will only encourage more
criminal activities.</i>

01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:31.392
<i>Those who plunder relics
are worse than thieves!</i>

01:17:31.524 --> 01:17:33.060
Yes!

01:17:36.274 --> 01:17:38.515
The golden mask of a pharaoh's concubine

01:17:38.649 --> 01:17:42.222
and the secret smiling Buddha
were passed in an auction today,

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:46.225
affected by the increasing
international uproar

01:17:49.649 --> 01:17:50.730
Police.

01:17:50.857 --> 01:17:52.598
Do you know these people?

01:17:57.066 --> 01:17:59.683
<i>In breaking news, MP
Corporation has announced</i>

01:17:59.816 --> 01:18:02.774
<i>it has won the right to
auction off the bronze</i>

01:18:02.899 --> 01:18:05.561
<i>the piece will go to market
as soon as possible.</i>

01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:07.432
I've called you more than 7,000

01:18:07.566 --> 01:18:08.647
Just say the word.

01:18:08.774 --> 01:18:10.811
From now on, in future, forever and ever...

01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:12.807
I won't call or bother you again.

01:18:12.941 --> 01:18:14.272
We know where it is!

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.097
Where is what?

01:18:18.857 --> 01:18:20.097
The Dragon-head!

01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:22.439
MP will put it up for auction next week!

01:18:22.566 --> 01:18:24.648
They've had it all along!

01:18:24.774 --> 01:18:27.641
We could never have gotten that bonus.

01:18:27.774 --> 01:18:29.515
We've been fooled.

01:18:29.649 --> 01:18:31.515
We behaved like amateurs!

01:18:31.649 --> 01:18:33.185
Jonathan lied to us.

01:18:33.316 --> 01:18:34.681
He has conspired with MP.

01:18:34.816 --> 01:18:36.773
I figure they beat up those students, too.

01:18:47.274 --> 01:18:49.481
Is it true that
two students from your organization

01:18:49.607 --> 01:18:50.938
were badly beaten up?

01:18:51.066 --> 01:18:52.522
Sorry, we cannot comment on this.

01:18:52.649 --> 01:18:53.389
Okay.

01:18:53.524 --> 01:18:54.104
Thank you.

01:18:54.232 --> 01:18:55.393
Sir, care to comment? No comment.

01:18:55.524 --> 01:18:56.104
Madam, please

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:57.313
These reporters!

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.513
<i>To demonstrate their discontent
with the sale of these relics</i>

01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:02.811
The crown jewel was originally

01:19:02.941 --> 01:19:05.273
an Indian national treasure of India.

01:19:05.399 --> 01:19:07.060
Why is it that our historical relics

01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:09.899
are on permanent display
in foreign museums?!

01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:12.398
<i>In time for the Chinese Year of the Dragon,</i>

01:19:12.524 --> 01:19:14.686
<i>I present the bronze Dragon-head.</i>

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:17.558
<i>Starting price 60 million euros.</i>

01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:19.307
<i>National heritage, NOT FOR SALE!</i>

01:19:19.441 --> 01:19:20.397
<i>Cultural relics from many countries</i>

01:19:20.524 --> 01:19:22.686
<i>were pillaged and ended up abroad.</i>

01:19:22.816 --> 01:19:24.853
<i>They include the star of today's auction,</i>

01:19:24.982 --> 01:19:27.565
<i>the renowned bronze Dragon-head.</i>

01:19:28.857 --> 01:19:30.097
Hello.

01:19:30.774 --> 01:19:32.356
Are you sure?

01:19:32.482 --> 01:19:33.938
I will come over right away.

01:19:34.066 --> 01:19:35.932
Tell my sister I will be back soon.

01:19:36.066 --> 01:19:37.272
What? I will be back soon.

01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:40.437
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any bids?

01:19:41.066 --> 01:19:42.522
Ten euro!

01:19:47.066 --> 01:19:48.181
Pass!

01:19:52.066 --> 01:19:54.273
<i>Any comment on the Dragon-head unsold?</i>

01:19:54.399 --> 01:19:56.060
<i>Will the Dragon-head re-auction again?</i>

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:59.809
<i>Do you think the unsold affect
the reputation of MP Corporation?</i>

01:20:03.107 --> 01:20:04.438
Take more at different angles!

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:07.058
Michelle, send this to Coco. Quickly!

01:20:08.816 --> 01:20:10.306
Take a few more with this.

01:20:16.191 --> 01:20:17.522
What interview?

01:20:17.649 --> 01:20:19.686
- I don't give interviews.
- An important call.

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:20.521
Hello.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:21.354
Boss.

01:20:21.482 --> 01:20:23.018
We caught three students. What now?

01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.889
What did they do?

01:20:24.024 --> 01:20:25.230
Same as previous two.

01:20:25.357 --> 01:20:26.347
They took photos again.

01:20:26.482 --> 01:20:27.472
Lock them up first.

01:20:27.607 --> 01:20:29.268
Is there really no other solution?

01:20:29.399 --> 01:20:30.935
I don't want it to drag on forever.

01:20:32.399 --> 01:20:33.560
I've been thinking about this all morning.

01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:34.977
Thanks!

01:20:35.107 --> 01:20:36.142
Johnny, Tommy

01:20:36.274 --> 01:20:38.185
Please give this letter to...

01:20:39.566 --> 01:20:41.102
Take it easy with women.

01:20:41.232 --> 01:20:42.688
Be cool, just like me!

01:20:43.732 --> 01:20:45.268
Hello?

01:20:46.607 --> 01:20:49.474
I know you! I recognize the voice.

01:20:49.607 --> 01:20:50.813
Your calls finally returned!

01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:53.023
No, I'm not busy.

01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:55.015
They're gone.

01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:56.514
Good.

01:20:57.607 --> 01:20:59.644
Anything, whatever you say

01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:05.853
Chinese, Japanese, Italian or French

01:21:05.982 --> 01:21:08.064
Fine. Love 'em all...

01:21:08.191 --> 01:21:10.228
Sure.

01:21:10.357 --> 01:21:12.064
Okay.

01:21:12.191 --> 01:21:13.773
I agree.

01:21:13.899 --> 01:21:15.139
Good choice!

01:21:15.274 --> 01:21:16.480
I agree.

01:21:16.607 --> 01:21:19.019
Great! I'll wait for you,

01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:20.230
until the end of time!

01:21:20.357 --> 01:21:22.314
Good. Yes, bye bye!

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:28.515
Yes! Yes!

01:21:29.774 --> 01:21:31.606
I knew you'd call me back!

01:21:33.232 --> 01:21:36.304
As a man sows, so shall he reap.

01:21:36.441 --> 01:21:39.058
God helps those who help themselves.

01:21:39.191 --> 01:21:40.352
Coco is here.

01:21:40.482 --> 01:21:41.017
Who?

01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:43.481
Coco. She's looking for you.

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:45.764
What does she want?

01:21:49.816 --> 01:21:50.897
A letter for me?

01:21:57.732 --> 01:21:59.939
Are those students okay?

01:22:00.066 --> 01:22:01.682
Three more are missing.

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:03.056
What?

01:22:03.191 --> 01:22:04.352
My brother,

01:22:04.482 --> 01:22:05.597
<i>Lily'</i>

01:22:05.732 --> 01:22:06.813
<i>and Michelle.</i>

01:22:08.732 --> 01:22:11.724
I grew up with my kid brother.

01:22:11.857 --> 01:22:14.064
Before my father passed away,

01:22:15.399 --> 01:22:18.517
he told me to look after him.

01:22:19.232 --> 01:22:21.473
He's my only family now.

01:22:22.899 --> 01:22:24.936
He is also our family's future.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.472
We're all passionate about

01:22:27.607 --> 01:22:30.520
each making our own contributions
to our countries.

01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:31.605
But now,

01:22:31.732 --> 01:22:33.393
two of us are lying in hospital beds,

01:22:33.524 --> 01:22:35.140
and three of us are missing.

01:22:35.274 --> 01:22:37.436
And we don't know if they are still alive.

01:22:38.191 --> 01:22:39.522
I beg you.

01:22:40.066 --> 01:22:40.771
Pull yourself together.

01:22:40.899 --> 01:22:42.355
Have you contacted the police?

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:44.890
I've tried everything.

01:22:45.024 --> 01:22:48.267
You are my very last resort.

01:22:48.399 --> 01:22:50.891
I'd love to help whenever I can.

01:22:51.024 --> 01:22:53.436
But these people

01:22:53.566 --> 01:22:56.024
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

01:22:59.566 --> 01:23:02.354
Professor Guan is detained by police

01:23:02.482 --> 01:23:04.473
for giving me those data.

01:23:14.816 --> 01:23:16.227
Why are you crying?

01:23:42.028 --> 01:23:47.028
<i>Mom & Dad, do you really have ti do this?</i>

01:23:50.816 --> 01:23:52.932
Coco said her brother disappeared

01:23:53.066 --> 01:23:54.898
while spying on MP after
the aborted auction.

01:23:55.024 --> 01:23:57.061
MP must have something to do with this.

01:23:57.191 --> 01:23:58.397
There are only trees, nothing else.

01:23:58.524 --> 01:23:59.104
Where's the proof?

01:23:59.232 --> 01:23:59.846
Let's check it out!

01:23:59.982 --> 01:24:01.343
Aren't you a compassionate person?

01:24:01.357 --> 01:24:02.563
I feel more for you.

01:24:02.691 --> 01:24:04.227
Is this what you really want?

01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:06.143
He insist on it! It's over between us!

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:07.810
We can't tolerate each other.

01:24:07.941 --> 01:24:09.397
What does that mean?

01:24:09.524 --> 01:24:11.731
You stink,
he disgrace himself in public, or what?

01:24:11.857 --> 01:24:13.723
Don't give up until you've really tried.

01:24:13.857 --> 01:24:15.643
Two grown-ups behaving worse than a child.

01:24:15.774 --> 01:24:17.811
At least your daughter wrote.
What have you done?

01:24:17.941 --> 01:24:19.227
We are destined to fail.

01:24:19.357 --> 01:24:20.313
Failure?

01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:21.721
Those who fail look for excuses.

01:24:21.732 --> 01:24:23.018
Those who succeed look for ways.

01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:24.981
Stop patronizing me! Lives are at stake!

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:26.563
Or it will be too late!

01:24:26.691 --> 01:24:29.479
It's easy to make rash promises. But how?

01:24:29.607 --> 01:24:30.928
Like you said, until you've tried

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:32.059
you must not give up!

01:24:32.191 --> 01:24:32.691
<i>Hey JC!</i>

01:24:32.816 --> 01:24:34.181
Jonathan!

01:24:34.316 --> 01:24:35.272
<i>What's up?</i>

01:24:35.399 --> 01:24:38.141
I've just found the Roses.

01:24:38.274 --> 01:24:39.639
<i>Good! I'll come right over.</i>

01:24:40.232 --> 01:24:41.472
That's my way!

01:24:42.107 --> 01:24:42.972
Speak!

01:24:43.107 --> 01:24:44.814
I didn't lie about MP's address.

01:24:44.941 --> 01:24:45.396
Why would I lie about it?

01:24:45.524 --> 01:24:46.389
Sure, I believe you.

01:24:46.524 --> 01:24:49.141
But you knew all along MP had dragon-head,
didn't you?

01:24:49.274 --> 01:24:51.185
We'd never get that bonus, would we?

01:24:51.316 --> 01:24:52.522
How would I know?

01:24:52.649 --> 01:24:53.889
We're old partners, why would I lie to you?

01:24:54.024 --> 01:24:54.855
You've never lied to me?

01:24:54.982 --> 01:24:56.768
Of course not! Why would I?

01:24:57.566 --> 01:24:59.432
What are you doing?

01:24:59.566 --> 01:25:00.351
This

01:25:00.482 --> 01:25:02.849
This is the world's most powerful acid.

01:25:02.982 --> 01:25:04.063
I formulated it specially for you.

01:25:04.191 --> 01:25:05.191
Have you ever lied to me?

01:25:06.191 --> 01:25:06.771
Yes.

01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:08.560
I lied to you from day one.

01:25:08.691 --> 01:25:09.647
From day one

01:25:14.232 --> 01:25:15.267
I've told you everything.

01:25:15.399 --> 01:25:16.639
Why did you do that for?

01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:21.731
Fruity Fruit salt?

01:25:22.274 --> 01:25:23.480
Genius!

01:25:29.316 --> 01:25:30.932
You came all the way to see me,

01:25:31.066 --> 01:25:33.273
just to cut out the middlemen?

01:25:33.399 --> 01:25:34.810
They are all blood-suckers.

01:25:34.941 --> 01:25:37.433
Jonathan lied about the Dragon-head.

01:25:38.857 --> 01:25:40.018
Can't blame him entirely.

01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:42.060
We had the Dragon-head all along.

01:25:42.191 --> 01:25:43.681
I just forgot about it.

01:25:43.816 --> 01:25:45.727
Never mind. In our line of business,

01:25:45.857 --> 01:25:48.224
we're used to conning each other

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:50.597
Where is the Roses?

01:25:59.774 --> 01:26:02.015
We wouldn't have brought it
if it's a fake.

01:26:02.649 --> 01:26:04.014
I still have to examine it.

01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:06.060
It cannot leave our sight.

01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:07.147
Sure.

01:26:10.357 --> 01:26:11.237
We are ready to begin.

01:26:11.274 --> 01:26:12.435
Just go ahead.

01:26:13.607 --> 01:26:15.268
Check this out for me.

01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:18.273
I can't clone one so quickly.

01:26:20.691 --> 01:26:22.102
Verify this.

01:26:22.607 --> 01:26:23.847
Wait here.

01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:26.265
Mind if we look around?

01:26:26.399 --> 01:26:27.434
Be my guest.

01:26:27.566 --> 01:26:30.149
An authentication center
underneath a vineyard?

01:26:30.274 --> 01:26:32.015
A hub for counterfeiting, actually.

01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:33.355
Billions of dollars of turnover each year.

01:26:33.482 --> 01:26:36.019
Everything is under their control.

01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:39.854
Wasn't that stolen
from an European museum earlier?

01:26:39.982 --> 01:26:41.188
Almost an exact replica!

01:26:41.316 --> 01:26:43.899
Artistes here are all masters
in their own right.

01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:45.810
But they won't be famous in their lifetime.

01:26:47.066 --> 01:26:48.773
Keep an eye on upstairs.

01:26:51.816 --> 01:26:53.147
What are they doing?

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:55.265
Sandblasting a porcelain vase,

01:26:55.399 --> 01:26:58.596
which will then be treated chemically,

01:26:58.732 --> 01:27:01.099
<i>and ends up like an age-old antique.</i>

01:27:01.232 --> 01:27:04.190
<i>Layers of Chinese Xuan
paper can be separated.</i>

01:27:04.316 --> 01:27:05.477
<i>This is an original.</i>

01:27:05.607 --> 01:27:07.327
<i>Peel it apart and you'll get two originals!</i>

01:27:07.399 --> 01:27:08.981
<i>You can make 5 or 6 copies out of it!</i>

01:27:09.107 --> 01:27:09.812
<i>But each copy would be too thin.</i>

01:27:09.941 --> 01:27:10.931
<i>What about that?</i>

01:27:11.066 --> 01:27:12.667
<i>That's silk, which cannot be peeled off.</i>

01:27:12.732 --> 01:27:15.850
<i>So they slice it up into 8 parts for sale.</i>

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:18.515
<i>How imaginative!</i>

01:27:19.316 --> 01:27:20.898
Fragments of excavated relics,

01:27:21.024 --> 01:27:22.264
<i>can be perfectly restored,</i>

01:27:22.399 --> 01:27:24.811
<i>by forging with a replica.</i>

01:27:24.941 --> 01:27:26.932
<i>So it's partly real partly fake.</i>

01:27:27.066 --> 01:27:28.556
When it is exposed to X-ray,

01:27:28.691 --> 01:27:31.729
a brand new vase can become 1,000-year-old.

01:27:31.857 --> 01:27:33.518
They are so resourceful!

01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:35.481
Is there anything real on the market?

01:27:35.607 --> 01:27:38.019
9 out of 1O are fakes.

01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:39.389
Pity the rich and famous!

01:27:40.357 --> 01:27:41.813
This way.

01:27:43.816 --> 01:27:44.977
JC

01:27:45.566 --> 01:27:46.727
Who's that?

01:27:47.982 --> 01:27:49.598
Probably one of Vulture's men.

01:27:50.482 --> 01:27:51.392
<i>What is this?</i>

01:27:51.524 --> 01:27:52.855
<i>This one</i>

01:27:54.024 --> 01:27:57.267
<i>A special furnace to
emulate carbon emissions.</i>

01:27:57.399 --> 01:27:59.390
<i>Designed to fool antique experts.</i>

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:02.061
<i>Its technology hasn't yet been perfected.</i>

01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:05.764
<i>Fuel and catalyst can
only be added manually.</i>

01:28:05.899 --> 01:28:07.230
<i>I can't believe they dare to go this far.</i>

01:28:07.357 --> 01:28:09.849
<i>It looks crude. Is it dangerous?</i>

01:28:10.566 --> 01:28:12.807
<i>Deception is always risky.</i>

01:28:14.232 --> 01:28:15.973
Nice to see you, JC!

01:28:21.566 --> 01:28:23.056
Did you lose your tongue?

01:28:23.857 --> 01:28:24.972
I don't want to see you.

01:28:25.107 --> 01:28:26.393
Come on, man.

01:28:26.524 --> 01:28:27.559
Who's this guy?

01:28:27.691 --> 01:28:29.682
This is JC.

01:28:29.816 --> 01:28:31.932
A big name in the business.

01:28:32.066 --> 01:28:34.353
Reputations can be deceiving.

01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:35.976
Competitor?

01:28:36.107 --> 01:28:37.393
We're not the same.

01:28:37.524 --> 01:28:38.980
We'd never do what he does.

01:28:39.107 --> 01:28:39.938
What?

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:42.265
Don't be so cocksure, alright?

01:28:42.399 --> 01:28:44.640
Whatever you do, I can do better.

01:28:49.066 --> 01:28:53.481
Vulture, you stole a Buddha
from a Southeast Asian temple.

01:28:53.607 --> 01:28:54.563
That's right.

01:28:54.691 --> 01:28:58.480
They thought it was the work of a neighbor.

01:28:59.274 --> 01:29:02.562
It sparked a border war,
killing thousands of people.

01:29:02.691 --> 01:29:04.181
People die.

01:29:06.191 --> 01:29:07.602
That's their business.

01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:10.683
You're the scumbag of our business.

01:29:11.524 --> 01:29:13.731
You know the last person who called me that

01:29:13.857 --> 01:29:15.268
is no longer breathing.

01:29:15.399 --> 01:29:16.605
Yeah?

01:29:18.399 --> 01:29:23.519
S-C-U-M-B-A-G!

01:29:24.274 --> 01:29:25.605
Scumbag.

01:29:26.899 --> 01:29:30.017
I can kick your ass
without leaving this couch.

01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:35.765
Show me.

01:29:55.191 --> 01:29:56.602
You lose!

01:29:56.732 --> 01:29:58.814
Still Touching.

01:31:16.607 --> 01:31:17.597
Touching.

01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:20.602
<i>Stop!</i>

01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:23.931
You can go now.

01:31:24.066 --> 01:31:25.272
Have a good vacation.

01:31:25.399 --> 01:31:26.730
Good night!

01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:33.063
What are you guys doing?

01:31:34.191 --> 01:31:35.852
Just checking the furniture.

01:31:37.774 --> 01:31:39.390
Cheap imitation.

01:31:39.524 --> 01:31:42.312
Hey boys, take it outside. Not here.

01:31:42.441 --> 01:31:43.681
Okay?

01:31:43.816 --> 01:31:44.977
It's the real thing. Be careful with it.

01:31:45.107 --> 01:31:46.347
The Roses!

01:31:46.482 --> 01:31:47.688
- Your eleven o'clock.
- Leave them here when you're done.

01:31:47.816 --> 01:31:49.398
We'll clear them later.

01:31:52.274 --> 01:31:53.981
You'll be paid tomorrow, as usual.

01:31:55.274 --> 01:31:57.641
Your price is too high. Let's wait for Dad.

01:31:57.774 --> 01:31:59.515
I can give you a discount.

01:32:00.107 --> 01:32:01.563
But I want three people.

01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:02.931
What?

01:32:03.607 --> 01:32:05.848
Those you locked up upstairs.

01:32:08.774 --> 01:32:10.685
I don't understand.

01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:12.514
Let me show you.

01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:17.227
That confirms my suspicion.

01:32:18.899 --> 01:32:21.231
Prove it if you can.

01:32:27.274 --> 01:32:28.730
I will.

01:32:30.024 --> 01:32:31.185
<i>Stop him!</i>

01:32:33.191 --> 01:32:34.022
<i>I said stop!</i>

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.980
<i>Don't move!</i>

01:32:35.107 --> 01:32:36.313
<i>Don't let him get away</i>

01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:40.855
<i>Stop!</i>

01:32:41.649 --> 01:32:42.764
<i>Stop him!</i>

01:33:16.732 --> 01:33:18.293
<i>There he is, let's go! He's down there!</i>

01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:43.432
Open the door! Hurry!

01:34:08.732 --> 01:34:11.645
JC, what have you proved?

01:34:29.274 --> 01:34:31.015
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

01:34:44.899 --> 01:34:47.607
I've been looking for a punchbag all day.

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:49.605
You've just hit the jack-pot.

01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:56.931
Vulture, do something.

01:34:57.066 --> 01:34:58.352
No, it's girl-on-girl time.

01:34:58.482 --> 01:34:59.643
Oh, yeah!

01:35:00.524 --> 01:35:01.935
Show me what you've got!

01:35:43.399 --> 01:35:44.889
He's over there! Get him!

01:35:47.774 --> 01:35:48.935
Is he still going?

01:36:18.066 --> 01:36:19.852
Vulture, take him out!

01:36:20.982 --> 01:36:22.438
That's not a real fight, man!

01:36:22.566 --> 01:36:25.604
Only pretty little sissy
with no balls fight that way.

01:36:25.732 --> 01:36:27.894
Now, that is a fair game.

01:38:21.982 --> 01:38:23.393
So ugly!

01:38:30.816 --> 01:38:31.816
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

01:38:31.857 --> 01:38:32.972
Get him!

01:38:40.274 --> 01:38:41.309
<i>It's gonna blow!</i>

01:38:42.274 --> 01:38:45.517
<i>Get out of there, it's gonna blow!</i>

01:38:45.649 --> 01:38:47.265
<i>Run! Quick!</i>

01:39:20.566 --> 01:39:22.853
Wu, are you okay?

01:39:24.774 --> 01:39:25.935
Martin!

01:39:29.857 --> 01:39:31.018
Katie!

01:39:32.732 --> 01:39:33.722
You alright?

01:39:33.857 --> 01:39:35.188
I'm okay

01:39:41.649 --> 01:39:43.014
Michael!

01:39:44.107 --> 01:39:45.438
Dad!

01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:51.022
Bonnie!

01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:52.685
Here, I'm fine.

01:39:55.399 --> 01:39:56.810
Lawrence.

01:39:56.941 --> 01:39:59.979
JC, finally we meet.

01:40:01.274 --> 01:40:02.730
Daddy!

01:40:02.857 --> 01:40:03.938
JC did it!

01:40:04.066 --> 01:40:05.352
Shut up!

01:40:05.482 --> 01:40:08.019
You idiot, I'd kill you!

01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:09.810
What did I teach you?

01:40:09.941 --> 01:40:12.273
We don't kidnap people!
We make fake things!

01:40:12.399 --> 01:40:15.437
Boss, I think we need to leave ASAP.

01:40:17.024 --> 01:40:17.889
Is that real?

01:40:18.024 --> 01:40:19.480
It is real.

01:40:19.607 --> 01:40:20.327
You had it tested?

01:40:20.357 --> 01:40:21.893
Yes, I have tested it.

01:40:26.274 --> 01:40:30.598
JC, I wish we could've met
under different circumstances.

01:40:30.732 --> 01:40:32.564
I wish you'd make real things.

01:40:32.691 --> 01:40:34.557
Well, you certainly took care of that.

01:40:34.691 --> 01:40:37.558
And for your trouble,
I'm going to keep this free-of-charge.

01:40:37.691 --> 01:40:39.978
Now, I certainly hope you'll escort

01:40:40.107 --> 01:40:42.269
these nice, young people home, safely,

01:40:42.399 --> 01:40:44.481
and that you and I
can resume our relationship.

01:40:44.607 --> 01:40:45.722
Is that a deal?

01:40:47.774 --> 01:40:48.514
Deal.

01:40:48.649 --> 01:40:50.060
Get 'em out of here.

01:40:52.107 --> 01:40:54.189
Oh, Sorry about the dragon.

01:40:54.316 --> 01:40:57.354
I guess it just disappeared. No extra zero.

01:40:57.482 --> 01:40:59.143
Enjoy your Roses.

01:41:00.941 --> 01:41:02.852
Dad, you're letting them off too easy.

01:41:02.982 --> 01:41:04.393
Interpol's onto this place.

01:41:04.524 --> 01:41:07.016
We have to destroy it anyway.
He just saved us the trouble.

01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:09.811
Salvage anything that's worth anything,

01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:11.648
then get the hell outta here.

01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:13.685
Make sure Frankie takes the blame.

01:41:13.816 --> 01:41:14.647
Okay, Dad.

01:41:14.774 --> 01:41:15.614
I have a job for you!

01:41:15.732 --> 01:41:16.722
Yes, sir!

01:41:16.857 --> 01:41:18.894
The antique market has tanked

01:41:19.024 --> 01:41:21.436
because of these whiny hippies
and their protests.

01:41:21.566 --> 01:41:23.307
I want to teach the world a lesson,

01:41:23.441 --> 01:41:24.852
starting with the Dragon-head.

01:41:24.982 --> 01:41:25.938
How?

01:41:26.066 --> 01:41:28.478
Time for the dragon to fly.

01:41:30.524 --> 01:41:31.889
<i>Vulture!</i>

01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:34.480
What a pity!

01:41:36.482 --> 01:41:38.043
<i>Auction houses have come under pressure</i>

01:41:38.066 --> 01:41:40.148
<i>after protests broke out around the world</i>

01:41:40.274 --> 01:41:42.265
<i>calling for the return
of national treasures.</i>

01:41:42.399 --> 01:41:44.857
<i>MP announced that
if the sale of the Dragon-head</i>

01:41:44.982 --> 01:41:48.304
<i>is affected by the protests,
they will be forced to act.</i>

01:41:48.941 --> 01:41:50.773
<i>Let's begin our private auction!</i>

01:41:50.899 --> 01:41:52.389
<i>For the precious Dragon-head,</i>

01:41:54.816 --> 01:41:56.306
Thank you so much!

01:41:56.441 --> 01:41:57.806
Great news!

01:41:57.941 --> 01:42:00.524
Chinese businesses worldwide donated $50M!

01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:02.356
So what? The government won't accept

01:42:02.482 --> 01:42:04.769
anything that is acquired from an auction.

01:42:04.899 --> 01:42:07.299
Tell them we will buy it first
and keep it in trust for them.

01:42:07.316 --> 01:42:09.648
No, whoever buys it will
become public enemy.

01:42:09.774 --> 01:42:12.061
<i>The second and last time
it will be up for auction,</i>

01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:14.023
<i>with no starting price.</i>

01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:16.140
<i>Do I have any opening bid?</i>

01:42:16.691 --> 01:42:18.978
<i>With the international
press waiting for answer,</i>

01:42:19.107 --> 01:42:22.645
<i>MP has threatened to dump
the head into a volcano</i>

01:42:22.774 --> 01:42:25.106
<i>if no bids are received before noon today.</i>

01:42:25.607 --> 01:42:26.813
<i>You can see the volcano behind me.</i>

01:42:26.941 --> 01:42:29.808
<i>The Dragon-head might be consumed by it.</i>

01:42:29.941 --> 01:42:30.931
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

01:42:31.066 --> 01:42:33.353
<i>Our mid-day deadline is fast approaching.</i>

01:42:33.482 --> 01:42:35.769
<i>I've yet to receive an opening bid.</i>

01:42:35.899 --> 01:42:36.889
<i>If the auction is aborted again,</i>

01:42:37.024 --> 01:42:38.435
<i>MP will dump the Dragon-head</i>

01:42:38.566 --> 01:42:41.103
<i>into the live volcano in front of us.</i>

01:42:43.607 --> 01:42:47.020
<i>At this stage,
I haven't received any opening bid.</i>

01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:48.731
Fair warning.

01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:51.685
<i>Fair warning.</i>

01:42:51.816 --> 01:42:53.432
Last chance.

01:42:54.774 --> 01:42:56.765
This item is unsold.

01:43:00.816 --> 01:43:03.979
Boss! The Dragon head's been
taken off the auction block.

01:43:05.566 --> 01:43:07.227
Dump it!

01:43:09.691 --> 01:43:11.932
Alright! Guys! Let's do this!

01:43:20.107 --> 01:43:21.142
<i>It's really happening.</i>

01:43:21.274 --> 01:43:22.730
<i>They've started their mission.</i>

01:43:22.857 --> 01:43:24.347
<i>Looking at the three skydivers,</i>

01:43:24.482 --> 01:43:27.440
<i>we can clearly see
one of them is holding the Dragon-head.</i>

01:43:27.566 --> 01:43:29.307
They're dumping it!

01:43:32.274 --> 01:43:32.934
<i>For the whole process,</i>

01:43:33.066 --> 01:43:35.728
<i>MP Corporation has named this mission.</i>

01:43:35.857 --> 01:43:37.689
<i>Let the Dragon Fly!</i>

01:43:48.191 --> 01:43:50.558
What is this? A 4th diver has appeared

01:43:51.066 --> 01:43:52.898
Check over there!

01:46:03.816 --> 01:46:04.977
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:46:07.441 --> 01:46:08.602
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:46:16.607 --> 01:46:18.063
<i>Save her!</i>

01:46:18.191 --> 01:46:19.431
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:46:34.232 --> 01:46:35.438
<i>He just let go of the Dragon-head!</i>

01:46:35.566 --> 01:46:37.056
<i>It's falling towards the volcano!</i>

01:47:10.066 --> 01:47:12.023
<i>They simply have to open their chutes now!</i>

01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:13.605
<i>But they're still free-falling!</i>

01:47:13.732 --> 01:47:15.643
<i>Very dangerous!</i>

01:47:24.399 --> 01:47:27.312
<i>A moment ago,
we captured a picture of this 4th jumper,</i>

01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:28.806
<i>but we still cannot identify him.</i>

01:47:28.941 --> 01:47:30.102
It's Martin!

01:47:30.232 --> 01:47:31.313
Martin!

01:47:32.191 --> 01:47:33.932
How could it be him?

01:47:39.524 --> 01:47:41.390
<i>You are a condor without wings,</i>

01:47:45.857 --> 01:47:47.894
<i>don't even think you can beat me.</i>

01:47:50.691 --> 01:47:52.898
<i>No! You're crazy!</i>

01:47:54.857 --> 01:47:57.815
<i>The mysterious man has just lost his chute!</i>

01:47:57.941 --> 01:48:01.935
<i>Not even the Dragon-head can save him!</i>

01:49:55.316 --> 01:49:56.681
It's yours!

01:49:58.857 --> 01:50:00.848
You're really something else, brother.

01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:35.774
<i>In our special report,
MP Corporation chief,</i>

01:50:35.899 --> 01:50:37.856
<i>Lawrence Morgan, and his son, Michael,</i>

01:50:37.982 --> 01:50:42.351
<i>were arrested after the stolen Roses,</i>

01:50:42.482 --> 01:50:44.189
<i>was found on MP property.</i>

01:50:44.316 --> 01:50:44.976
Yes! Wonderful!

01:50:45.107 --> 01:50:46.472
<i>And here's a special story.</i>

01:50:46.607 --> 01:50:48.598
<i>Todya, four foreign consuls each received,</i>

01:50:48.732 --> 01:50:52.054
<i>unmarked packages containing
lost national treasures.</i>

01:50:52.191 --> 01:50:54.774
<i>They include
the Egyptian Pharaoh's Golden scepter,</i>

01:50:54.899 --> 01:50:57.140
<i>Czarina Catherine of Russia's staff,</i>

01:50:57.274 --> 01:51:00.812
<i>an lncan jewelry box decorated
with a golden eagle.</i>

01:51:00.941 --> 01:51:03.057
<i>And don't forget the Star of Arabia.</i>

01:51:03.191 --> 01:51:06.354
<i>Now nobody knows who
this mystery sender is.</i>

01:51:06.482 --> 01:51:08.018
<i>Quite amazing, isn't it?</i>

01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:10.356
<i>In similar news, Japan has just announced</i>

01:51:10.482 --> 01:51:13.975
<i>it will return five ancient books to Korea.</i>

01:51:15.399 --> 01:51:16.514
Yes!

01:51:16.649 --> 01:51:18.481
Hi! My name is Anna

01:51:18.607 --> 01:51:20.848
I'm be happy on behalf of
the Association of Cultural Preservation,

01:51:20.982 --> 01:51:23.519
I give you this as
a token of our appreciation.

01:51:23.649 --> 01:51:24.855
Thank you very much.

01:51:24.982 --> 01:51:25.642
No need to thank him.

01:51:25.774 --> 01:51:27.765
He has sold more than he donates.

01:51:29.232 --> 01:51:31.064
Look, Professor Guan has been freed.

01:51:31.191 --> 01:51:33.774
Mr. Liao, your wife has just given birth!

01:51:33.899 --> 01:51:35.014
I am coming!

01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:36.685
I've got to go! You run along.

01:51:36.816 --> 01:51:37.396
I'll go and check it out.

01:51:37.524 --> 01:51:40.232
JC, you're the man!

01:51:42.857 --> 01:51:44.143
<i>- You dated me!
- Said you'd show up for sure!</i>

01:51:44.274 --> 01:51:45.395
It's loud! You listen to it.

01:51:45.441 --> 01:51:47.023
<i>- I'm leaving!
- I've eaten every cuisine on offer here!</i>

01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:48.731
<i>And still you're nowhere</i>

01:51:49.941 --> 01:51:51.272
Coco!

01:51:51.399 --> 01:51:52.230
BYE-bye!

01:51:52.357 --> 01:51:53.688
Catherine!

01:51:53.816 --> 01:51:55.432
I have something for you.

01:51:56.649 --> 01:51:57.980
Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?

01:51:58.107 --> 01:51:59.973
I learned from you. I stole it!

01:52:00.107 --> 01:52:02.474
Bankers won't know
how to appreciate it anyway.

01:52:02.607 --> 01:52:02.937
You

01:52:03.066 --> 01:52:06.479
Since we parted, I've
been learning Chinese.

01:52:07.399 --> 01:52:08.184
It's wonderful!

01:52:08.316 --> 01:52:09.772
A present from my sister.

01:52:13.607 --> 01:52:15.063
Purple!

01:52:15.607 --> 01:52:16.517
How is JC?

01:52:16.649 --> 01:52:17.559
He's come around. You can see him.

01:52:17.691 --> 01:52:18.931
I'll go to see him now.

01:52:20.441 --> 01:52:21.681
Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?

01:52:21.732 --> 01:52:23.063
Check it out!

01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:27.060
Try to settle your differences.

01:52:28.774 --> 01:52:30.139
Mama!

01:52:34.607 --> 01:52:36.723
<i>Only the efforts of two half-decent people</i>

01:52:36.857 --> 01:52:39.315
<i>can give her a decent
environment to grow up.</i>

01:52:43.441 --> 01:52:44.772
If you are willing,

01:52:45.524 --> 01:52:47.356
we can start all over again.

01:52:52.357 --> 01:52:53.142
It's a girl!

01:52:53.274 --> 01:52:54.435
Come and see for yourself!

01:52:55.274 --> 01:52:56.184
Congratulations!

01:52:56.316 --> 01:52:57.181
What's her name? So lovely!

01:52:57.316 --> 01:52:58.351
Pax! Pax?

01:52:58.482 --> 01:52:59.768
It's Latin for peace.

01:52:59.899 --> 01:53:01.856
JC gave me four names to choose

01:53:02.649 --> 01:53:04.231
Sis? Sis?

01:53:06.691 --> 01:53:07.522
Who is she?

01:53:07.649 --> 01:53:08.514
The voice-mail lady!

01:53:08.649 --> 01:53:09.409
Let's check it out!

01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:10.897
I will be right back.

01:53:15.399 --> 01:53:17.686
Come over here!

01:53:18.107 --> 01:53:19.563
Who is she?

01:53:19.691 --> 01:53:21.523
He's going to be fine.
In fact, he is healing quickly.

01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:23.936
He could check out of here
within a week or two.

01:53:24.066 --> 01:53:25.602
Thank you.

01:53:29.524 --> 01:53:30.434
I was just thinking

01:53:30.566 --> 01:53:31.601
It's okay.

01:53:32.274 --> 01:53:33.935
That was an old message.

01:53:34.066 --> 01:53:35.977
Now I know what you've been up to.

01:53:36.566 --> 01:53:37.727
Get up!

01:53:44.357 --> 01:53:45.392
<i>Action!</i>

01:54:15.691 --> 01:54:16.726
<i>Stung my palms!</i>

01:54:18.899 --> 01:54:20.560
<i>Get the dogs! Control them!</i>

01:54:22.649 --> 01:54:24.310
<i>Good boy.</i>

01:54:25.732 --> 01:54:26.597
<i>Not again!</i>

01:54:26.732 --> 01:54:27.722
<i>Get the dog!</i>

01:54:58.732 --> 01:55:01.929
<i>Don't stand too close to the edge.
It's dangerous!</i>

01:55:06.232 --> 01:55:08.849
<i>I'm here when it explodes!</i>

01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:43.855
<i>You really slapped me!</i>

01:55:57.066 --> 01:55:58.227
<i>Stop it, it's NG already!</i>

01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:11.982
<i>I'm very scared whenever
I have a dangerous performance.</i>

01:56:12.107 --> 01:56:13.438
<i>I think a lot.</i>

01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:16.183
<i>It might be my last shoot,</i>

01:56:16.316 --> 01:56:18.557
<i>and the last one in my life.</i>

01:56:28.066 --> 01:56:28.851
<i>Was it okay?</i>

01:56:28.982 --> 01:56:30.188
<i>We are not the same</i>

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:31.602
<i>We are</i>

01:56:31.732 --> 01:56:33.643
<i>We are not the same</i>

01:56:33.774 --> 01:56:36.061
<i>We will never do what he does!</i>

01:56:36.524 --> 01:56:37.730
<i>Stay clear</i>

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:39.347
<i>Chubby, let's have some smoke!</i>

01:56:40.024 --> 01:56:41.856
<i>Three, Two, One</i>

01:56:51.274 --> 01:56:53.060
<i>Machine can understand me.</i>

01:56:55.566 --> 01:56:56.897
<i>Hold tight!</i>

01:56:57.305 --> 01:57:03.167
