__

00:46.668 --> 00:49.303

00:54.935 --> 00:58.522
<i>When the poor besieged residents
of Kinlochbervie</i>

00:58.605 --> 01:01.525
<i>needed to get rid
of their horrible bog monster,</i>

01:01.608 --> 01:03.527
<i>who do you think they called?</i>

01:03.861 --> 01:06.363
<i>Me an' my partner, that's who.</i>

01:23.672 --> 01:25.883
<i>And we showed that bog monster.</i>

01:25.966 --> 01:27.759
<i>We showed it what for.</i>

01:38.896 --> 01:42.983
Ah, Pajuna, you're
a fantastic teller of the tall tales.

01:43.358 --> 01:45.694
A cow, defeating a bog monster?

01:45.777 --> 01:47.779
You know, that's impossible to imagine.

01:49.406 --> 01:51.408
Nope, I literally cannot do it.

01:55.245 --> 01:59.395
Well, I'd better go.
I wouldn't want vintage Pajuna

01:59.396 --> 02:01.543
to gouge me with her horns or anything.

02:01.627 --> 02:02.961
Toro, toro.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.591
I must go too, for the hour is late,

02:07.674 --> 02:10.928
and I must search far and wide
to find the Obelisk of Night.

02:13.055 --> 02:14.014
The what?

02:14.598 --> 02:16.600
Seriously? The Obelisk of Night?

02:16.683 --> 02:19.811
The key to defeating the Bloodwolf,
how have you not heard of this?

02:20.395 --> 02:21.980
I have problems at home.

02:25.108 --> 02:25.943
Off I go

02:26.026 --> 02:29.696
on a real adventure doing real things
that really, very really, happen.

02:29.905 --> 02:32.699
What I'm doing here is implying
that your stories are false. Goodbye.

02:35.118 --> 02:37.788
Hmm. Think what you want, lad.

02:38.539 --> 02:41.166
Boy, it must be hard for a former...

02:42.251 --> 02:43.877
...adventurer like yourself

02:43.961 --> 02:47.214
to be spending your life
as nothing more than a town milk vendor.

02:47.756 --> 02:52.010
Everyone knows that I'm capable
of a lot more than just vending milk.

02:52.928 --> 02:54.888
I'm glad my past is behind me.

02:54.972 --> 02:56.723
Wouldn't want it showing up again.

03:17.953 --> 03:20.038
Okay, here's the deal, barkeep.

03:20.122 --> 03:24.501
There are two tusks stuck in my face,
none stuck in yours.

03:24.584 --> 03:28.255
Hand over a drink,
and we might just keep it that way.

03:31.049 --> 03:32.259
Hello, Roz.

03:32.592 --> 03:35.304
Still doing the tusks-in-the-face bit,
are ya?

03:37.639 --> 03:41.226
After all these years,
the ol' gal recognizes me.

03:41.310 --> 03:46.481
- She recognized me.
- Eames, this is my old partner, Roz.

03:48.066 --> 03:50.485
Juna, ya' ol' bag of porridge.

03:50.569 --> 03:52.195
How the heck are ya, huh?

03:52.279 --> 03:54.031
What do you want, Roz?

03:54.531 --> 03:58.285
- Oh, you know, I just came for...
- And don't say a drink.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.288
Ye dinnae come all the way
to San Lorenzo for a drink.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.627
Hmm, grassy.

04:07.252 --> 04:09.421
The reason I came to see you is...

04:10.672 --> 04:11.882
I need your help.

04:13.550 --> 04:14.593
With a job.

04:15.218 --> 04:17.471
Absolutely not.

04:18.596 --> 04:20.974
Come on, it's a huge pay out.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.727
Besides, the target
is a real fierce warrior,

04:23.810 --> 04:25.228
and I can't do it alone.

04:25.312 --> 04:27.356
I'm out of the hire-muscle game.

04:27.939 --> 04:30.901
You got something better going on
in this dumpy old town?

04:30.984 --> 04:33.278
I'll have you know
that I'm a crucial member

04:33.362 --> 04:35.238
of this upstanding community.

04:35.322 --> 04:38.367
I have loads of
terribly important responsibilities.

04:38.450 --> 04:40.285
I want milk!

04:52.839 --> 04:54.299
Look, I'm happy here.

04:55.050 --> 04:56.510
The answer is no.

04:59.971 --> 05:02.641
Well, hoped it wouldn't come
to this, Juna,

05:02.724 --> 05:04.601
but need I remind you about...

05:05.352 --> 05:07.104
Urquhart Castle?

05:13.193 --> 05:14.861
I'm calling in my favor.

05:15.904 --> 05:17.739
You owe me, partner.

05:21.535 --> 05:22.536
Fine.

05:22.619 --> 05:23.704
One last job.

05:24.371 --> 05:25.580
Then I'm done.

05:26.081 --> 05:28.250
The gang's back together.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.252
Pajuna and the pig.

05:30.335 --> 05:32.379
The porcine and the bovine.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.881
- The hooves for hire.
- Already regret this.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.592
♪ Me and ol' Pajuna ♪

05:37.676 --> 05:39.678
♪ It's just like old times ♪

05:39.761 --> 05:41.513
♪ Doing lots of things and stuff ♪

05:41.596 --> 05:43.348
♪ And something else that rhymes ♪

05:44.224 --> 05:45.976
So, who are we after?

05:46.226 --> 05:48.103
Some guy with a funny name.

05:48.186 --> 05:49.521
Hang on, I've got it here.

05:50.647 --> 05:51.857
"Puss in Boots."

05:53.191 --> 05:54.693
Apparently, he's kinda famous.

05:57.779 --> 06:01.199
I... eh... never heard of him.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.290
You think we should
go back to town and ask?

06:08.373 --> 06:09.541
- Maybe somebody there...
- Oh, no.

06:10.125 --> 06:13.962
Nobody in that dumpy old town
knows anything about that specific topic.

06:14.045 --> 06:16.798
Uh, let's walk in the opposite direction.

06:16.882 --> 06:21.428
All I know is, wherever this Boots guy is,

06:21.511 --> 06:24.181
he's gonna be sorry he ever met me.

06:32.981 --> 06:34.941
And I'd better make sure he doesn't.

06:48.205 --> 06:49.331
He's close.

06:49.414 --> 06:53.835
Mugs.
Get your mugs here. Two for one.

06:53.919 --> 06:57.589
Buy two, get one free. Mugs. Get your...

06:57.672 --> 07:00.217
I really don't think
we should bother these thieves.

07:00.300 --> 07:04.012
Why, they've probably never even heard
of this "Puss in Boots" guy.

07:04.095 --> 07:06.348
"Puss in Boots" guy?
Of course I...

07:09.434 --> 07:11.686
This place is some meat market.

07:11.937 --> 07:12.938
Hey, good looking.

07:13.188 --> 07:14.981
Ooh, love the mask.

07:15.148 --> 07:17.859
Heck of a threatening glare you got there,
tough guy.

07:18.527 --> 07:22.614
We do not usually get
positive reinforcement from strangers.

07:22.823 --> 07:26.159
I'm having a hard time knowing
how to deal with these feelings.

07:26.243 --> 07:28.829
Don't get too chummy
with these thieves, Roz.

07:28.912 --> 07:31.456
They're nothing
but a bunch of vile, depraved...

07:33.875 --> 07:35.919
So I says to the guy, "Maim him?

07:36.002 --> 07:37.295
I don't even know him."

07:41.258 --> 07:43.718
And then I did maim him,
that's the punch line.

07:44.719 --> 07:47.180
What a violent story. Good one.

07:47.973 --> 07:48.932
Hey, Pajuna,

07:49.015 --> 07:51.309
come meet Julio, Agosto, and Pablo.

07:51.393 --> 07:53.854
Uh! It's Raul, but that's okay.

07:53.937 --> 07:56.940
Whoa. So, this is Pajuna.

07:57.023 --> 08:01.194
We heard about how you betrayed Roz
at Urquhart Castle. How terrible.

08:01.278 --> 08:06.074
What... How did you possibly have time
to tell them about that already?

08:06.157 --> 08:09.369
How could you betray Roz?
She's our favorite.

08:09.452 --> 08:13.290
Yeah, she's a real hoot.
Anyway, I'm afraid we've got to be going.

08:13.373 --> 08:15.750
Have any of you seen
any obelisk-looking things lately?

08:17.002 --> 08:21.047
Okay. Well, clearly he's not here,
let's be on our way.

08:21.172 --> 08:23.008
But we haven't scoured
the whole market yet.

08:23.091 --> 08:25.093
This Puss in Boots could be nearby.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.888
Puss in Boots? Why, he's right over...

08:31.725 --> 08:34.144
Would you look at that?
People fainting left and right.

08:34.227 --> 08:35.477
Must be something in the air.

08:35.562 --> 08:37.022
Come on, let's go.

08:41.943 --> 08:44.988
Salutations, Pablo,
have you seen any obelisks lately?

08:45.071 --> 08:46.406
It's Raul.

08:46.489 --> 08:50.118
Pajuna! Pajuna!

08:50.201 --> 08:51.703
Pajuna.

08:59.836 --> 09:02.005
Eames, are you all right?

09:02.088 --> 09:04.966
No. Pajuna's gone. Gone!

09:05.050 --> 09:07.260
Which means I'm going to starve to death.

09:07.344 --> 09:09.429
I have literally no idea
where food comes from,

09:09.512 --> 09:10.889
other than the canteena.

09:10.972 --> 09:12.849
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

09:12.933 --> 09:15.685
I haven't eaten in almost two hours.

09:15.769 --> 09:17.228
 I want milk!

09:18.480 --> 09:20.607
Just have some pickle brine instead.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.818
Drink this stuff, and pretty soon
you'll look as good as I do.

09:31.201 --> 09:33.036
Usually by this hour,

09:33.119 --> 09:36.581
Pajuna's already yelled at me
three or four times.

09:36.873 --> 09:42.212
I feel really unstimulated
without any conflict in my life.

09:42.295 --> 09:44.839
Come on, guys, we don't need Pajuna.

09:44.923 --> 09:48.677
Look, I made a drawing of her.
It's exactly as good as the real thing.

09:49.052 --> 09:51.972
So, Chalk Pajuna,
what do you think of my new vest?

09:52.555 --> 09:55.767
It hurts. Pajuna,

09:55.850 --> 09:57.560
where are you?

10:01.815 --> 10:04.401
Roz and Pajuna, back on the hunt.

10:04.484 --> 10:06.361
The ol' R and P.

10:06.444 --> 10:07.612
The cow and the sow.

10:08.113 --> 10:09.239
Rozzy and Juna.

10:09.322 --> 10:11.533
How many nicknames do you have for us?

10:11.616 --> 10:14.077
It's like we haven't missed a beat.

10:14.285 --> 10:16.746
I was worried
you might've gone soft, sister.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.499
But you've still got
that fighting instinct.

10:20.333 --> 10:21.835
 Nonsense.

10:21.918 --> 10:23.670
Okay.

10:24.254 --> 10:26.297
Whatever you... say!

10:27.632 --> 10:28.883
Ha!

10:28.967 --> 10:33.263
Knew it. You miss being out here,
mixing it up, breaking bones.

10:33.346 --> 10:34.931
That was a fluke.

10:35.015 --> 10:36.641
Oh, it was?

10:36.725 --> 10:38.852
'Kay, I believe you.

10:43.815 --> 10:45.483
Fighting instinct.

10:46.109 --> 10:47.318
So impressive.

10:47.902 --> 10:51.031
Still the best body slam I've ever seen.

10:51.114 --> 10:52.782
Really? Well,

10:52.866 --> 10:55.118
suppose it is nice
to get a bit of recognition

10:55.201 --> 10:57.078
for your talents every now and then.

10:57.787 --> 10:58.621
Hey,

10:58.705 --> 11:01.708
let's see if we can shake down
these goblins for some info.

11:04.586 --> 11:06.629
Here's the deal, goblin.

11:07.213 --> 11:09.132
There are two tusks stuck in my face...

11:09.215 --> 11:11.342
Excuse me. Can I help you?

11:12.343 --> 11:15.555
Hi, there. We're looking for
Puss in Boots. He's not here, is he?

11:15.638 --> 11:17.807
Even if he is here,
just say no.

11:18.683 --> 11:20.185
Uh, no?

11:20.685 --> 11:21.770
Rats.

11:21.853 --> 11:24.939
Oh, darn. He's forever eluding us.

11:25.023 --> 11:25.940
Thank you.

11:26.566 --> 11:28.943
Uh, I have to go over there now.
Excuse me.

11:29.652 --> 11:34.115
There ya go, not here.
Not nowhere. Let's call it quits.

11:34.199 --> 11:37.494
No way. Puss in Boots is nearby.
I can feel it.

11:37.577 --> 11:41.080
That's ridiculous.
I'm sure he...

11:41.164 --> 11:44.459
Uh... isn't anywhere near here.

11:45.168 --> 11:47.670
Hey, you know what I just remembered?

11:47.754 --> 11:49.839
Our secret handshake.

11:49.923 --> 11:51.007
Oh, yeah.

11:56.805 --> 11:58.097
Obelisk.

11:58.681 --> 12:00.600
Oh, Obelisk.

12:00.683 --> 12:02.644
That's not the handshake I remember.

12:02.727 --> 12:05.647
You know, I think I'm getting my appetite
for adventure back.

12:05.730 --> 12:07.148
I knew it.

12:07.232 --> 12:09.776
Now the old team really is back together.

12:09.859 --> 12:10.944
The demolition...

12:11.486 --> 12:15.323
What say we get back on the road?
Right now. This very instant.

12:15.406 --> 12:16.616
Woo-hoo!

13:22.849 --> 13:24.559
I'm glad to see
you haven't lost your touch

13:24.642 --> 13:26.352
when it comes to road gruel, Juna.

13:26.436 --> 13:28.438
Is there anything you're not good at?

13:28.521 --> 13:29.772
You know,

13:29.856 --> 13:33.526
that's the kinda question a cow
could stand to hear about more often.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.029
I tell ya, despite everything,

13:36.613 --> 13:40.575
- this has actually been fun.
- That's what I've been saying.

13:40.658 --> 13:43.536
Hey, why don't we get the team
back together, huh?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.623
Roz, I can't. San Lorenzo needs me.

13:47.332 --> 13:49.167
Ah, come off it, Juna.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.753
You think the people there
actually care about you?

13:52.295 --> 13:54.964
You're nothing
but a walking milk jug to them.

13:55.048 --> 13:57.926
They've probably found themselves
another moo-cow already.

13:58.009 --> 13:59.844
The road is where you belong.

13:59.928 --> 14:02.096
Crackin' skulls and takin' names.

14:02.180 --> 14:06.935
Believe me, sister, once a hired thug,
always a hired thug.

14:17.904 --> 14:19.781
Kick. Punch. Maim.

14:21.115 --> 14:22.992
Kick. Punch. Maim.

14:23.451 --> 14:24.994
Kick. Punch. Maim.

14:27.622 --> 14:29.749
Kick. Punch. Maim.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.883
Hey, Julio.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.343
Uh, hello, Roz.

14:40.927 --> 14:42.887
I was just out
for an early-morning steal...

14:42.971 --> 14:45.723
Stroll. Early-morning stroll.

14:45.807 --> 14:49.519
I definitely was not here to rob you.

14:49.602 --> 14:51.646
So, how are things?

14:51.729 --> 14:54.065
Oh, you know, just getting my sweat on.

14:54.148 --> 14:56.234
As soon as sleeping beauty here wakes up,

14:56.317 --> 14:58.820
we're gonna get back on the hunt
for Puss in Boots.

14:58.903 --> 14:59.904
Puss in Boots?

15:00.238 --> 15:02.448
Have you not checked in San Lorenzo?

15:02.532 --> 15:04.951
After all, that is where he lives.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.954
Son of a...

15:09.789 --> 15:13.584
Oh. It's like Urquhart Castle
all over again.

15:21.718 --> 15:24.929
Puss in Boots.

15:25.013 --> 15:27.140
Come out and face me.

15:28.182 --> 15:29.225
Excuse me?

15:30.226 --> 15:32.270
Do you make milk? I want milk.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.189
Scram, kid. No milk today.

15:36.482 --> 15:38.484
I want Pajuna!

15:39.610 --> 15:40.903
Hey, mustache,

15:40.987 --> 15:42.322
where's Puss in Boots?

15:42.405 --> 15:46.159
I haven't seen him today,
but have you seen a cow anywhere?

15:46.242 --> 15:47.744
Her name's Pajuna.

15:47.827 --> 15:48.953
My wife is upset,

15:49.037 --> 15:50.163
and I don't know what to do.

15:50.246 --> 15:53.207
Do I talk to her?

15:53.291 --> 15:55.626
Do I leave her alone?

15:55.710 --> 15:57.503
 Fake my own death?

15:58.254 --> 16:00.548
I'm lost without Pajuna's advice.

16:00.798 --> 16:02.550
Uh...

16:03.134 --> 16:07.096
I'm so weak. Pajuna.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.806
Pajuna.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.269
I'm too young and beautiful to die.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.483
Hey, Girl Cat.

16:18.566 --> 16:19.525
Where's Puss?

16:19.609 --> 16:22.445
Couldn't say. But do you know
where my friend, Pajuna, is?

16:22.528 --> 16:24.364
She's the cow who runs our canteena.

16:24.447 --> 16:26.824
Everyone's going a little crazy
without her.

16:26.908 --> 16:31.120
Good one, Chalk Pajuna.

16:31.204 --> 16:33.498
Huh. Maybe they really do need her.

16:40.004 --> 16:41.839
- Oh! Thief!
- Yes?

16:42.131 --> 16:45.760
Oh! You were saying "thief"
more generally as in,

16:45.843 --> 16:49.389
"That person is stealing from me."
You know, which I am.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.723
Uh, bye.

16:56.604 --> 16:58.981
Ha!

17:05.320 --> 17:07.615
Where's Roz? What have you done with him?

17:07.824 --> 17:08.950
Me? Nothing.

17:09.032 --> 17:12.328
She went to San Lorenzo,
to kill Puss in Boots.

17:18.459 --> 17:20.877
Where's that cow? I need my pickles.

17:20.962 --> 17:23.047
Milk! Milk! Milk! Milk! Milk!

17:23.131 --> 17:26.175
Have you seen Pajuna?
There's no one to yell at me.

17:26.259 --> 17:27.385
The boar.

17:27.468 --> 17:29.595
She took Pajuna from us.

17:30.179 --> 17:33.182
- I didn't take Pajuna. I...
- It's her fault we're starving.

17:33.266 --> 17:35.393
Her fault we have no one
to give us advice.

17:35.893 --> 17:39.063
Her fault we have no one
who can perform surgery. Her fault we...

17:40.440 --> 17:43.693
- My beautiful finger.
- What is the meaning of this?

17:49.031 --> 17:50.241
Puss in Boots?

17:50.783 --> 17:53.119
Who wants to know? Friend?

17:53.786 --> 17:54.871
Or foe?

17:55.455 --> 17:56.956
I'll let you know in a moment.

17:57.123 --> 17:58.207
First, however...

18:01.169 --> 18:02.003
En garde!

18:12.889 --> 18:14.140
My question stands.

18:18.394 --> 18:21.230
Friend or foe?

18:22.273 --> 18:23.691
Seriously?

18:29.822 --> 18:31.032
Hold on, Puss.

18:32.325 --> 18:33.284
I'm comin'.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.207
As fast as I can.

18:50.426 --> 18:51.969
Puss. Roz.

18:53.012 --> 18:53.971
Where are they?

18:58.017 --> 18:59.685
Roz, don't do it!

19:02.939 --> 19:04.273
And then you maimed him,

19:04.398 --> 19:05.900
without even knowing him.

19:05.983 --> 19:07.902
Roz, you are a hoot.

19:07.985 --> 19:09.153
I know, right?

19:09.237 --> 19:11.030
What in the...

19:11.113 --> 19:12.615
Oh, hello, Pajuna.

19:12.698 --> 19:15.660
Why have you never before
introduced me to your friend, Roz?

19:15.743 --> 19:17.161
She's outrageous.

19:17.745 --> 19:20.331
Roz. What's going on here?

19:20.414 --> 19:21.832
Funny story.

19:21.916 --> 19:24.460
I came back here to find puss
and finish him off.

19:24.544 --> 19:25.628
Yeah-ha!

19:25.711 --> 19:26.921
Oh, you.

19:27.004 --> 19:29.257
You are crazy.

19:29.340 --> 19:32.093
But when I got here,
it was just one person after another

19:32.176 --> 19:33.010
asking where you were.

19:33.094 --> 19:36.180
And I realized
you really are a part of this town.

19:38.182 --> 19:40.560
I'm sorry I tried to change you, sister.

19:41.686 --> 19:42.687
Do you forgive me?

19:44.438 --> 19:45.356
Of course.

19:45.439 --> 19:48.693
As long as you forgive me
for what happened at Urquhart Castle.

19:48.776 --> 19:50.403
Ah, why not?

19:50.486 --> 19:52.363
I guess I can let you off the hook.

19:53.030 --> 19:55.992
By the way, what did happen
at Urquhart Castle?

19:56.075 --> 19:57.076
Uh, eh...

19:57.159 --> 19:59.161
I can't remember.

19:59.662 --> 20:01.163
Oh. Me neither.

20:01.247 --> 20:03.624
Shoot, I'm just really bad at grudges.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.042
Pajuna's back.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.464
Oh, Pajuna, everyone's missed you so much.

20:10.548 --> 20:12.508
We're so glad you're back.

20:12.592 --> 20:16.387
Hm. And not just because you want milk?

20:16.470 --> 20:20.474
- Oh, no. For all kinds of reasons.
- I'm so hungry...

20:20.558 --> 20:23.936
Mostly because we're getting really tired
of Eames whining about how hungry he is.

20:26.272 --> 20:29.108
Thank heavens.

20:29.191 --> 20:31.485
Never leave us again.

20:36.157 --> 20:39.076
Don't worry,
this won't change anything between us.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.627
Food!

20:48.711 --> 20:51.422
I apologize for not believing
your tales, Pajuna.

20:51.505 --> 20:53.799
If you are half the fighter
Roz says you are,

20:53.883 --> 20:57.845
then I am glad
I never had to face "Vintage Pajuna."

20:58.137 --> 21:00.765
From now on, I will always pay my bar tab.

21:00.848 --> 21:03.184
Mostly. Sometimes. A little.

21:03.267 --> 21:07.229
So, wait, after all this,
you didn't even fight Puss?

21:07.813 --> 21:09.690
Oh, we fought all right.

21:46.477 --> 21:49.188
So, break for lunch?

21:50.272 --> 21:51.440
Break for lunch.

21:51.524 --> 21:54.068
And now, Roz has decided
to stop trying to kill me,

21:54.151 --> 21:55.111
because she admires...

21:55.194 --> 21:56.654
...and respects me so much.

21:56.737 --> 21:58.572
Oh, let's get one thing clear.

21:58.656 --> 22:01.158
I'm still very much trying to kill you.

22:05.663 --> 22:07.873
Ah, you're just too darn hard to kill.

22:07.957 --> 22:09.709
Never give up, my friend.

22:10.668 --> 22:11.711
All right, kiddo.

22:11.794 --> 22:13.879
It's time I hit the dusty road.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.675
So impressive.

22:21.345 --> 22:23.597
And the fearsome boar struck out

22:23.681 --> 22:25.975
in search of her next adventure,

22:26.058 --> 22:30.020
for in San Lorenzo,
she had truly met her match.

22:30.104 --> 22:32.481
The valiant Puss in Boots.

22:32.565 --> 22:35.651
 I like this story.
It has me in it.
