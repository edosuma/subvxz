00:01.126 --> 00:03.368
<i>They've got
to stop them in this series.</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:06.959
- Geez!
- Come on! - Damn it!

00:07.424 --> 00:09.757
<i>In Texas, the Holy Trinity</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:13.962
<i>is God, football and barbeque,</i>

00:14.389 --> 00:16.551
<i>not necessarily in that order.</i>

00:16.892 --> 00:21.102
I don't care if you win,
just cover the damn spread.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.349
Mom, are you
betting again?

00:22.564 --> 00:23.520
No.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.688
<i>...fans on their feet,</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:25.856
<i>trying to urge the defense on.</i>

00:26.068 --> 00:27.184
Fourth down.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.438
Gotta punt.

00:28.654 --> 00:29.610
Gotta.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.192
Statistically, always
punting on fourth down

00:32.406 --> 00:33.363
makes no sense.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.157
Statistically,
you're a dumbass.

00:35.369 --> 00:35.984
Hey.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.535
When the Aggies give up the ball

00:37.746 --> 00:39.362
on their own five-yard line,

00:39.581 --> 00:42.949
the opposing team has
a 92% chance of scoring.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.875
When they punt from deep
in their own territory,

00:45.087 --> 00:48.546
the other team still has
a 77% chance of scoring.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.793
<i>But since they convert</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:52.671
on fourth down 50% of the time,

00:52.886 --> 00:55.344
the math says they should
never punt again.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.347
Okay, you can tell me,
who's his real daddy?

01:03.146 --> 01:06.389
Sheldon, I've been playing and
coaching football all my life.

01:06.650 --> 01:07.982
I don't think your math
is right.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.521
Really?

01:09.736 --> 01:11.022
Hang on.

01:11.863 --> 01:12.728
No, it's right.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.405
<i>...able to hold A&M
to a field goal,</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:16.073
<i>they'll only be down six points.</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:17.446
Is it your dentist?

01:17.661 --> 01:19.072
The little guy
with the glasses?

01:19.538 --> 01:20.654
You can tell me.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.810
I got to tell you, I'm a little
worried about my mother.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.637
She keeps betting on
these football games,

01:45.856 --> 01:47.518
next thing you know,
there's an Italian fella

01:47.733 --> 01:49.725
driving off with
her pickup truck.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.191
You think
Sheldon's right?

01:54.573 --> 01:55.654
About what?

01:55.866 --> 01:58.028
The punting
and the math.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.901
I should think so.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.112
He's been doing our taxes
since he's six years old.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.447
We never been audited.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.288
That's true.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.875
He even got us that
nice refund last year.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.463
How come Mom's
not taking me to school?

02:21.099 --> 02:21.964
'Cause once in a while,

02:22.184 --> 02:24.301
your dad wants to spend
some time with you.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.726
My little Shel-man.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.309
But Mom's car has a backseat.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.060
Statistically,
I'm much safer there.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.108
Hey, I'm glad you brought up
statistically.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.607
You think those numbers you
talked about for Texas A&M

02:35.822 --> 02:37.313
would apply to
my JV squad?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.320
I don't see why not.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.495
Unlike our former principal,
math doesn't discriminate.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.077
You're not thinking about
taking his advice, are you?

02:47.292 --> 02:49.375
- Never you mind.
- But he's wrong.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.452
Everybody knows
you punt on fourth down.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.255
Why does everybody knowing
something make it right?

02:54.675 --> 02:55.882
Because.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.344
That's what makes
this country great.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.004
<i>Many years later,</i>

03:02.224 --> 03:04.181
<i>my brother would use
this same argument</i>

03:04.393 --> 03:06.009
<i>in front of a judge.</i>

03:06.228 --> 03:09.312
<i>He was still convicted
for urinating in a phone booth.</i>

03:21.743 --> 03:23.279
Oh, damn it.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.531
I'll send in
the punting team.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.869
Hang on. Hang on.

03:26.081 --> 03:26.912
What?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.533
Let's go for it.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.583
Why? We got plenty of time.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.752
I know. Still want to go for it.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.040
We're on the 12-yard line.
Everybody know you punt.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.467
Why does everybody knowing
something make it right?

03:42.097 --> 03:44.464
But we're on
the 12-yard line, Coach.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.306
Okay, Coach says
we're going for it.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.890
Stupid brother.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.688
- What?
- Nothing.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.646
- Power left jumbo on two, on two. Ready?
- Break!

03:56.403 --> 03:59.146
<i>And your Wolves
are going for it on fourth down.</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:01.356
What the hell? Punt!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.942
Statistically, they're
better off going for it.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.494
- Says who?
- My little boy.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.203
That's why everybody punts.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.004
That was just
plain foolishness.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.255
Your little boy's
a real genius.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.209
Well, actually he is.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.386
Too many men on
the field, defense.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.842
Replay fourth down.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.598
Ah. Thank you, Jesus.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.770
Now, can I send in
the punt team?

04:37.402 --> 04:38.358
<i>Coach?</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:41.069
Break!

04:43.283 --> 04:44.444
<i>And they're
going for it again.</i>

04:44.659 --> 04:46.195
What the hell? Punt!

04:46.411 --> 04:48.118
Remind me to tell you about
the tax refund I got

04:48.330 --> 04:49.696
from the IRS.

04:50.290 --> 04:50.996
Set. Hut!

04:56.671 --> 04:58.412
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

05:00.509 --> 05:01.499
- Go!
- Whoo!

05:03.011 --> 05:05.173
Go, go, go! Go!

05:05.388 --> 05:07.345
<i>He's at the 30, the 20, the 10.</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:09.765
<i>Touchdown, Wolves!</i>

05:13.605 --> 05:15.813
I never had any doubt, Coach.
Never had any doubt.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.107
Oh, booyah! Yes.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.322
Sweet dreams, baby.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.702
Mwah.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.704
Night, Meemaw.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.871
Can I ask you a favor?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.423
- Sure. What?
- You know those statistics

05:42.634 --> 05:44.216
that you were talking about
with your dad?

05:44.427 --> 05:48.011
Could... could that be
applied to, say,

05:48.223 --> 05:50.556
who might win the
Cowboys-Packers game next week?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.885
And, more specifically,
by how much?

05:54.980 --> 05:58.064
I suppose with enough data
I could make a reasonable guess.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.392
I don't want a guess,
I want to know.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.691
Mom said you're not
supposed to gamble.

06:01.903 --> 06:02.939
Sleep, child!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.438
<i>- Mom?</i>
- In here!

06:05.657 --> 06:07.398
I'll get those
numbers to you tomorrow.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.160
Just tucking him in.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.240
I got something for you.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.287
It's dirty.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.911
Well, that's 'cause
it's the game ball.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.418
And you earned it,
'cause you helped us win.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.299
Okay, but can you wash it?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.883
Sheldon, your daddy's
telling you he's proud of you.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.886
I see. Thank you, Dad.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.891
You're welcome.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.309
I'm still never touching that.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.439
Let's go wipe it off.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.273
<i>For the next five weeks,</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:51.154
<i>I continued to help
my father apply statistics</i>

06:51.369 --> 06:52.780
<i>to coach his team.</i>

06:52.996 --> 06:55.204
<i>Not surprisingly,
they continued to win,</i>

06:55.415 --> 06:58.249
<i>which changed my status
in the school dramatically.</i>

06:58.460 --> 06:59.246
- Yo, Sheldon!
- There he is!

07:00.837 --> 07:01.497
Shel-dog!

07:01.713 --> 07:02.794
Math man!

07:03.548 --> 07:05.961
Hey, cutie.

07:06.718 --> 07:07.674
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

07:07.886 --> 07:09.422
Shel-dog! Woo-hoo!

07:09.763 --> 07:12.506
<i>Hugging, hair tousling,
high fives.</i>

07:12.724 --> 07:16.058
<i>And as my popularity grew,
so did my time aloft.</i>

07:32.577 --> 07:35.615
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.738
Do you know how
popular we are?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.498
- We?
- Yeah.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.167
I put the word out I was helping
you with the football stats.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.870
And since I'm Asian,
they bought it.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.129
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.006
You're not?

07:48.259 --> 07:51.093
I was touched 82 times
this afternoon.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.545
What do you mean, "touched"?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.130
Not inappropriately.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.430
Joyfully.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.053
Affectionately.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.430
A cheerleader hugged me
to her bosom.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.853
That's amazing.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.397
No more high fives.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.224
I can't keep
washing my hands.

08:12.117 --> 08:12.857
Hey.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.367
There's my little
assistant coach.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.910
Hello, Dad.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.955
You have any more,
uh, arithmetic ideas

08:20.166 --> 08:21.327
for next week's game?

08:21.543 --> 08:23.876
I do, but I'm trying
to finish my homework.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.419
Ah.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.507
Looks complicated.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.173
Advanced chemistry.
It's not.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.429
What are you guys doing?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.597
Your brother and I are gonna
knock around a few ideas

08:37.808 --> 08:39.174
for the Freeport game.

08:39.894 --> 08:40.759
Can I help?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.682
Actually, yeah.
Run out to my truck.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.138
There's a little, uh,
pocket calculator

08:44.357 --> 08:45.347
on my front seat.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.811
I got you a present.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.063
Thought it might help
with your figuring.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.692
I don't need a calculator, Dad.
I am one.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.022
Sure.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.072
Well...

08:54.993 --> 08:56.154
Go get it anyway.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.407
It's solar-powered.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.284
Can you imagine that?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.351
Georgie, turn that down!

09:22.562 --> 09:23.268
What?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.481
And look at this room.
You need to clean this mess up.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.027
I'll get to it later.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.399
No, you'll get to it now.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.856
I don't feel like it.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.275
Well, your feelings have
nothing to do with it.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.826
And stop throwing that ball.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.279
My room bothers you so much,
you clean it.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.083
<i>That's it!
You are grounded! You hear me?!</i>

09:46.294 --> 09:47.125
The hell?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.171
Hey...!

09:51.382 --> 09:52.498
There's my little Moonpie.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.384
Did you get a chance to look
at this week's games for me?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.713
- Not yet.
- You understand there's a little time crunch involved.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.471
Meemaw's got some outstanding
loans I need to pay back.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.426
I'm sorry,
I have to finish my homework

10:04.646 --> 10:06.387
and then I have to help my dad.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.230
Come on.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.933
I'm your meemaw.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.602
I make you cookies.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.278
How 'bout a little quid pro quo?

10:14.489 --> 10:15.445
As much as I enjoy

10:15.657 --> 10:17.774
your use of Latin, no.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.617
Shelly, time to get ready
for bed.

10:20.829 --> 10:21.990
But I'm not done.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.616
Don't you sass me, too,
young man.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.164
Brush your teeth and get to bed.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.626
I think your anger might be
a little misdirected.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.127
Don't you start
with me either.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.209
Now, see,
you're still shootin' wide.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.057
Good evening,
Mrs. Cooper.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.184
Can I speak to Sheldon?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.515
No, you can't speak to Sheldon.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.349
It's late. He's in bed.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.528
Oh. I was hoping he might like
to go to a party with me.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.604
Has everyone lost their mind?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.406
He's a little boy, Tam!

10:59.659 --> 11:00.649
Good night!

11:02.036 --> 11:05.700
Good Lord, that mouth of yours
is a machine gun tonight.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.037
What are you doing?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.464
Trying to calculate
the odds of the Dolphins

11:15.675 --> 11:17.712
covering the spread next Sunday.

11:17.969 --> 11:18.800
I like dolphins.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.425
They talk out of that hole
in their head.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.423
Hello.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.553
Tam?

11:29.314 --> 11:30.270
What are you doing here?

11:30.481 --> 11:32.097
Would you like to go
to a party with me?

11:32.317 --> 11:33.774
I don't want to go to a party
with anyone.

11:33.985 --> 11:34.725
I would!

11:35.278 --> 11:35.893
Please, Sheldon.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.478
It's right across the street.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.529
Just get me in,
and you can go back to bed.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.406
I have to ask my mom.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.405
No need.
She knows all about the party.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.703
All right, then.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.451
I need a minute
to change.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.287
- Why are you wearing that?
- It makes me look older.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.674
Just so we're clear,
once you get in,

11:58.927 --> 12:00.384
I'm going home.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.798
Hey! Sheldon!

12:03.014 --> 12:04.175
What are you doing?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.632
Hey, everybody, check it out! Sheldon's here!

12:10.939 --> 12:13.101
I hope that doesn't
wake up the kids.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.477
Should I go over there
and say something?

12:14.692 --> 12:15.648
I think you should.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.894
I was bluffin'.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.234
Don't make me
put my socks back on.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.236
Never mind.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.658
Good night.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.285
Good night.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.037
I feel bad about
yelling at Georgie.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.252
He deserved it.

12:39.634 --> 12:40.841
You should do it more.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.421
I think he's feeling left out

12:42.637 --> 12:45.220
now that you and Sheldon are
spending so much time together.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.768
Are you kiddin' me?
You're always saying to find

12:50.979 --> 12:51.890
something in common
with Sheldon.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.937
And now that I have, you're
telling me I'm ignoring Georgie?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.730
I'm not saying that.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.604
I'm just reminding you

12:57.819 --> 12:59.105
that you got two sons.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.527
I know.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.281
I also got a daughter
I need to spend more time with.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.278
You do.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.409
But I wouldn't worry about her.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.986
She's an angel.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.835
- - Yeah, Sheldon!
- Put me down!

13:17.046 --> 13:19.538
I said put me down!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.214
<i>Put me down!
I'm not enjoying this!</i>

13:21.426 --> 13:23.088
Missy, what are you doing here?!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.090
Cuttin' loose.
What are you doing here?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.420
Slowly! Slowly!

13:26.639 --> 13:27.675
Slowly!

13:29.100 --> 13:30.056
You, too?!

13:30.268 --> 13:31.600
Hello, Georgie!

13:31.811 --> 13:33.222
You're not supposed
to be here.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.600
Neither are you!
You're grounded!

13:37.025 --> 13:37.640
Come on.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.475
Both of you are going home. Now.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.856
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Aw.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.527
How's puberty
treating you?

13:46.743 --> 13:48.780
Because it is
knocking me for a loop.

13:50.872 --> 13:51.737
Right?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.416
<i>Somehow,
my parents didn't find out</i>

14:00.631 --> 14:02.497
<i>about me partying heartily.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:03.961
<i>But I did pay a price</i>

14:04.177 --> 14:06.590
<i>for burning the candle
at both ends.</i>

14:06.804 --> 14:09.217
<i>I made a mistake
on a math test.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:12.720
<i>In my exhaustion,
I did all the calculations</i>

14:12.935 --> 14:13.800
<i>in my head,</i>

14:14.020 --> 14:17.559
<i>and, like a common zoo animal,
forgot to show my work.</i>

14:18.775 --> 14:20.687
I just saw one of those girls
from the party,

14:20.902 --> 14:23.235
and she acknowledged
my existence by doing this.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.737
I've never felt so alive.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.071
Are you okay?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.118
No, I'm not.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.698
Yeah, so?

14:36.626 --> 14:39.164
A B-plus... that's
the beginning of the end.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.668
The end of what?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.916
My life.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.714
If I don't make some changes,
who knows how far I'll fall.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.218
I could wind up a drug addict,
or a lawyer.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.136
Is it possible
you're overreacting?

14:50.473 --> 14:54.262
No. Starting today, I'm done
helping the football team.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.474
But if you do that, girls will
no longer greet me like this.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.897
I'll greet you like that.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.896
It's not the same.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.905
<i>Extricating
myself from this situation</i>

15:08.116 --> 15:09.948
<i>was not going to be easy.</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:13.618
<i>My father was counting on me,
Meemaw was counting on me,</i>

15:13.830 --> 15:15.822
<i>the school was counting on me.</i>

15:16.124 --> 15:18.457
<i>After much thought,
I decided to employ</i>

15:18.668 --> 15:22.161
<i>the one strategic maneuver
I knew I could count on.</i>

15:22.463 --> 15:23.374
<i>I tattled.</i>

15:23.589 --> 15:24.170
Mom?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.432
<i>Sheldon got a B-plus!
That's terrible for him!</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:42.435
I'm very disappointed
in all three of you.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.393
That is right. Missy, this
is for your ballet class.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.149
<i>We do not go
to parties.</i>

15:48.448 --> 15:50.155
<i>I am very disappointed.</i>

15:56.122 --> 15:56.953
Hey.

15:58.332 --> 15:58.947
<i>Got to go pick up</i>

15:59.167 --> 16:00.999
some equipment for the team;
you want to join me?

16:01.419 --> 16:02.910
Can't. I'm grounded.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.333
Yeah, well...

16:05.590 --> 16:06.831
I won't tell if you won't.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.793
Sheldon going?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.091
That little snitch?
Absolutely not.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.977
Sheldon still gonna
help you with the math?

16:21.189 --> 16:22.475
I don't think so.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.148
But I did hear his little
Asian friend can do it.

16:34.911 --> 16:35.742
Hey.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.110
Hello.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.661
So...

16:39.123 --> 16:41.365
Oilers are a four-point favorite
for this Sunday's game,

16:41.584 --> 16:45.168
but it's a home game, so I'm
thinking I give the points.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.208
What do you think?

16:47.882 --> 16:49.965
I think I have
to tell on you again.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.634
Go ahead. What's your
mama gonna do, ground me?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.758
Take the Oilers,
give the points.

17:00.061 --> 17:03.054
I love you, Moonpie.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.768
<i>For the record,
the Oilers lost that game</i>

17:08.986 --> 17:10.818
<i>by four touchdowns.</i>

17:11.239 --> 17:13.731
<i>Meemaw never asked
for my advice again.</i>

17:16.868 --> 17:20.782
Come on, come on,
come on. Damn it!

17:21.040 --> 17:21.655
Okay.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.040
One more time.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.544
Mama needs a new Jet Ski!

17:27.838 --> 17:28.669
And...

17:28.881 --> 17:30.088
rat bastard!

17:32.426 --> 17:33.792
How you doin' there, Connie?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.920
Hey, Vincent.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.721
What brings you
to Louisiana?

17:38.933 --> 17:39.923
Wait, don't tell me.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.633
You're here to see Tony Orlando.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.135
'Fraid not.

17:43.354 --> 17:44.765
Oh, well, you ought
to check him out.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.189
He'll, uh, knock your socks off.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.898
I like my socks on.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.854
Connie, you're putting me
in a very awkward position.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.613
I won a toaster oven
playing keno.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.822
You want it?

17:58.327 --> 17:59.317
I got one.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.411
I want my money.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.158
All right.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.657
Hang on.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.993
<i>That's a very nice jacket.</i>

18:08.212 --> 18:09.578
You're looking dapper.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.917
Ah.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.718
Hey, they comp my room here.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.010
They do that for you?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.885
Actually, they frown
upon my presence here.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.140
Oh. I also get a coupon
for the breakfast buffet.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.515
You should look into that.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.607
Constance!

18:31.819 --> 18:33.685
Patience, Vincenzo.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.613
Yes!

18:40.828 --> 18:42.364
<i>Oh!</i>

18:42.580 --> 18:44.492
<i>All right, now we're talking.</i>

18:44.707 --> 18:46.699
Will you take a down payment
in quarters?

18:46.917 --> 18:47.998
Do I have a choice?

18:49.545 --> 18:50.831
Start scoopin'.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.666
I got to go see Tony Orlando.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.794
Oof.

19:08.898 --> 19:09.854
Hey!

19:10.399 --> 19:12.607
Hey, I need another cup!
