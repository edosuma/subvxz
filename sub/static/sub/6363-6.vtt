WEBVTT

00:01.526 --> 00:02.617
Hold on, guys!

00:02.697 --> 00:03.721
<i>Last week...</i>

00:03.801 --> 00:05.589
Oh, my God!

00:06.704 --> 00:08.805
<i>An epic kids' birthday bash...</i>

00:08.839 --> 00:11.523
I need 16 of everything!
Go, go, go!

00:11.603 --> 00:13.504
<i>Gave Addison's blue team...</i>

00:13.538 --> 00:15.907
These wings are burnt.
Oh, my God!

00:15.941 --> 00:16.941
<i>Reason to celebrate.</i>

00:18.210 --> 00:20.945
<i>But a towering dessert challenge</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:24.081
<i>ended the party
for Nate and Derek.</i>

00:24.116 --> 00:26.951
We'll miss you!

00:26.985 --> 00:29.253
<i>Tonight, a juicy challenge...</i>

00:29.288 --> 00:30.588
Hurry!

00:30.622 --> 00:33.090
<i>Puts the squeeze
on the junior home cooks.</i>

00:33.125 --> 00:35.226
The team that makes
the best lemonade

00:35.260 --> 00:37.428
will stay nice and dry.

00:37.462 --> 00:38.629
<i>And then...</i>

00:38.664 --> 00:40.631
- Oh, my God!
- Groovy, baby.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.633
<i>Things turn really sour.</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:43.768
<i>What the heck?</i>

00:43.802 --> 00:46.737
She wears underwear
outside her pants!

00:46.772 --> 00:49.674
<i>When the judges
take a trip down memory lane.</i>

00:49.708 --> 00:51.809
Oh!

00:51.843 --> 00:54.011
I'm totally fine.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:04.122 --> 01:06.190
- Let's go!
- Whoo!

01:06.225 --> 01:07.358
- Ohh.
- Whoo!

01:07.392 --> 01:09.160
Welcome.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.163
<i>I'm really happy for everyone
'cause we're in the top 14,</i>

01:12.197 --> 01:14.799
and I'm closer to getting
my hands on that trophy

01:14.833 --> 01:16.567
and having my food dream

01:16.602 --> 01:19.136
of opening up a restaurant
run by kids.

01:19.171 --> 01:21.072
Let's go.

01:21.106 --> 01:22.440
Oh, there's
something behind them.

01:25.811 --> 01:27.879
Welcome back, everybody.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.447
You kids have all got it made.

01:29.481 --> 01:33.384
You are the 14 best young home
cooks in all of America,

01:33.418 --> 01:36.487
and your future
couldn't be brighter.

01:36.521 --> 01:39.724
But things for us
aren't so easy.

01:39.758 --> 01:43.227
We are just three chefs
struggling to make ends meet.

01:44.763 --> 01:46.664
Oh, my God.

01:46.698 --> 01:47.898
What?

01:47.933 --> 01:49.467
You're Gordon Ramsay.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.135
You're the most
famous chef ever.

01:51.169 --> 01:53.905
You have, like, a million,
kazillion dollars.

01:53.939 --> 01:57.308
But, guys,
we are struggling chefs,

01:57.342 --> 01:59.810
so we had to come up
with a new business venture.

01:59.845 --> 02:01.445
Oh, my God.

02:01.480 --> 02:05.249
What?

02:05.284 --> 02:07.051
What is it?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.318
Lemonade stand!

02:09.922 --> 02:12.556
We drink a ton of lemonade
back in Texas,

02:12.591 --> 02:14.926
so I'm not nervous at all

02:14.960 --> 02:17.762
because lemonade is my thing.

02:17.796 --> 02:21.265
In the next challenge, you will
all be making lemonade

02:21.300 --> 02:23.067
in two teams of seven.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.835
Here we have seven longs straws,

02:24.870 --> 02:26.971
seven short straws.

02:27.005 --> 02:29.206
And depending on what
straw you draw,

02:29.241 --> 02:32.643
that will determine
which team you'll be on.

02:32.678 --> 02:35.012
I hope I'm with Avery,

02:35.047 --> 02:37.648
because I think Avery
drinks a lot of lemonade

02:37.683 --> 02:39.617
back in Louisiana,

02:39.651 --> 02:40.952
and she's my friend.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.553
Tae-Ho, let's go.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.323
Purple is my favorite color.

02:45.357 --> 02:46.424
- Excellent.
- Awesome.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.492
So you have a long straw.

02:48.527 --> 02:52.129
Zac, let's go, please.

02:52.164 --> 02:53.431
Long straw.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.634
Jesse, let's go, bud.

02:56.668 --> 02:57.735
Wow.

02:57.769 --> 03:00.271
Well, first short straw, Jesse.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.607
Let's go, Kya.
Can you reach?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.308
Yeah.

03:06.511 --> 03:08.212
Short straw.

03:08.246 --> 03:11.182
Yay!
Big and small, oh!

03:11.216 --> 03:13.851
Let's go, Kamilly.

03:13.885 --> 03:15.086
- Yay!
- Short straw.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.787
- Yay!
- Yay!

03:16.822 --> 03:18.789
I'm looking at
the long straw team,

03:18.824 --> 03:21.459
and it's full of, like,
the older kids.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.960
Whoo!

03:22.995 --> 03:26.063
They have some
very strong competitors,

03:26.098 --> 03:29.767
so I definitely want to be
on the long straw team.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.304
- Long one.
- Yes!

03:33.338 --> 03:34.672
Yes!

03:34.706 --> 03:35.973
Amaya, here we go.
Let's go.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.108
Good girl.

03:37.142 --> 03:38.276
Yes!

03:38.310 --> 03:40.378
And, Sam, let's go, bud.

03:40.412 --> 03:42.213
Whee, Sam.

03:42.247 --> 03:43.681
Short straw.

03:43.715 --> 03:45.449
We're gonna win!

03:45.484 --> 03:46.594
I think we have the best team

03:46.618 --> 03:48.786
because we have Addison,
Tae-Ho, and Mia...

03:48.820 --> 03:50.187
Thank you, Chef.

03:50.222 --> 03:52.290
And they're all
really good team players,

03:52.324 --> 03:53.902
and they work really well
under pressure.

03:53.926 --> 03:56.127
Now each team will have
just seven minutes

03:56.161 --> 03:58.629
to make a full drinks dispenser

03:58.664 --> 04:01.832
of delicious
raspberry mint lemonade.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.968
- What?
- Whoo.

04:04.002 --> 04:05.436
When those seven minutes are up,

04:05.470 --> 04:08.005
I'm going to do
a blind taste test

04:08.040 --> 04:09.373
of both teams' lemonade.

04:09.408 --> 04:11.142
Oh, my gosh, Christina.

04:11.176 --> 04:14.512
I will decide which team's
lemonade I like the best.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.180
The winning team's gonna be safe

04:16.214 --> 04:19.283
and will not have to cook
in the next challenge.

04:19.317 --> 04:22.687
So, guys, this is huge.

04:22.721 --> 04:23.754
Oh, yeah.

04:23.789 --> 04:25.656
But there's more.

04:28.961 --> 04:30.027
Oh, no, what is it?

04:30.062 --> 04:31.395
Yeah!

04:36.902 --> 04:38.035
Behold...

04:38.070 --> 04:39.537
It's water balloons
full of lemonade.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.572
Give us lemonade!

04:41.607 --> 04:43.174
At the end of this challenge,

04:43.208 --> 04:44.609
guess who's gonna get drowned

04:44.643 --> 04:45.943
by one of those balloons

04:45.978 --> 04:47.745
filled with delicious lemonade.

04:47.779 --> 04:50.248
- Not me.
- Not me.

04:50.282 --> 04:52.984
It's right over me!

04:53.018 --> 04:54.218
You guys!

04:57.656 --> 05:00.524
Tonight it's your turn.

05:00.559 --> 05:03.261
I cannot get this lemonade
on my head.

05:03.295 --> 05:06.731
This hair is too precious
to be soaked with stickiness.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.900
The team that makes
the best lemonade

05:08.934 --> 05:10.001
will stay nice and dry.

05:10.035 --> 05:11.235
Oh, yes.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.671
The losing team will be
hit by a lemonade shower.

05:13.705 --> 05:15.740
- Ha!
- That is cruel.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.476
All right, guys, it is time to
head to your stations, let's go.

05:18.510 --> 05:21.379
Yeah!

05:21.413 --> 05:22.680
We're gonna win!

05:22.714 --> 05:24.682
At your stations you
have everything that you need

05:24.716 --> 05:26.851
to make us your
raspberry mint lemonade.

05:26.885 --> 05:29.453
You have 50 lemons, six juicers,

05:29.488 --> 05:31.422
a bowl of raspberries, mint,

05:31.456 --> 05:34.759
and water and sugar
to make your simple syrup.

05:34.793 --> 05:38.062
Your seven minutes starts...

05:38.096 --> 05:39.063
now.

05:39.097 --> 05:40.308
Me and Ian are doing the lemons.

05:40.332 --> 05:41.376
He's on that side,
I'm on this side.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.443
I need two people
to do raspberries.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.101
We're doing raspberries.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.636
Yeah, raspberries.

05:45.671 --> 05:46.871
There's no team captain,

05:46.905 --> 05:48.973
but I really want to step up
on this challenge.

05:49.007 --> 05:50.308
And what I've learned

05:50.342 --> 05:52.076
is that it's all
about the teamwork,

05:52.110 --> 05:53.588
so I'm making sure
everybody gets a job.

05:53.612 --> 05:56.180
Ian, you're gonna do
one, two, three.

05:56.215 --> 05:58.182
Shh, shh.

05:58.216 --> 06:00.618
Guys, guys.

06:00.652 --> 06:01.852
We're just bringing it...

06:01.887 --> 06:04.088
The blue team is,
like, screaming,

06:04.122 --> 06:05.823
and we're not even organized.

06:05.857 --> 06:08.426
We're not gonna win if we're
not gonna communicate well.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.871
Listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me.

06:09.895 --> 06:11.529
- Guys, I have a plan.
- Tae-Ho, shh!

06:11.563 --> 06:14.131
Red team, blue
team, six minutes to go.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.167
Better start juicing
those lemons.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.269
Okay, guys,
make more than we need.

06:18.303 --> 06:20.504
Maybe a little more water
than sugar.

06:20.539 --> 06:21.850
No, three cups water,
three cups sugar.

06:21.874 --> 06:23.040
Got it.

06:23.075 --> 06:25.042
Hey, guys, let's just go
as fast as we can!

06:25.077 --> 06:26.454
It doesn't matter
how much lemonade you get.

06:26.478 --> 06:28.613
Just get all of them done.

06:28.647 --> 06:30.948
Right, this has to be
a unique lemonade.

06:30.983 --> 06:32.750
Yeah, and they're not
just taking lemon juice

06:32.784 --> 06:34.252
and stirring it with sugar.

06:34.286 --> 06:36.354
- You put the simple syrup?
- Yeah, it's on.

06:36.388 --> 06:37.755
They need to make
a simple syrup,

06:37.789 --> 06:39.133
which is like
a sugar water solution

06:39.157 --> 06:40.802
so that you don't get
any of that grittiness

06:40.826 --> 06:42.460
and you can control
the sweetness

06:42.494 --> 06:44.174
and the balance of flavor
in this lemonade.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.530
I'm looking for the balance

06:46.565 --> 06:49.867
of lemon to raspberry
to mint to sugar,

06:49.902 --> 06:51.903
because everything needs
to be in harmony

06:51.937 --> 06:55.806
to make this really upscale
lemonade from scratch.

06:55.841 --> 06:57.041
Oh, dang it.

06:57.075 --> 06:59.043
Okay, guys, we got this.

07:01.113 --> 07:02.346
Don't worry about them, Ian.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.514
Let's just keep on juicing.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.692
Four minutes to go, guys.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.850
Hurry!

07:05.884 --> 07:07.551
Raspberry, over there!
Raspberry walking.

07:07.586 --> 07:09.053
Put the lemon juice in there.

07:09.087 --> 07:10.321
Add the water!
Not all of it!

07:10.355 --> 07:11.633
Stop, that's too much,
that's too much.

07:11.657 --> 07:13.724
No, it isn't, Kaitlyn.
Let her add a lot.

07:13.759 --> 07:16.027
The blue team got a majority
of the older kids in there,

07:16.061 --> 07:17.361
so I'm thinking theirs should be

07:17.396 --> 07:18.540
a little bit more sophisticated,

07:18.564 --> 07:19.574
but they're just shouting
at each other.

07:19.598 --> 07:22.033
Guys, hot pan!
Hot pan!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.701
My concern with the blue team

07:23.735 --> 07:25.536
is that there seems to be
six leaders

07:25.571 --> 07:27.572
out of seven home cooks,
and that's really

07:27.606 --> 07:29.507
not gonna behave
on a team challenge.

07:29.541 --> 07:31.175
Seven individuals, not a team.

07:33.645 --> 07:35.413
Go, go, go, Sam.

07:35.447 --> 07:36.847
Need more lemonade!

07:36.882 --> 07:39.617
The red team looks strong.

07:39.651 --> 07:41.819
Look at the level of control

07:41.854 --> 07:43.354
that's happening
on the red team.

07:43.388 --> 07:45.456
Sam, I got more lemon juice!

07:45.490 --> 07:47.325
Lemon! Lemon!

07:47.359 --> 07:48.626
Right here.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.004
The red team is actually working

07:50.028 --> 07:51.729
very effectively
and efficiently.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.064
It tastes really good.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.576
But it really will
all come down to flavor.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.034
- Yep.
- We just need some more mint.

07:57.069 --> 07:58.102
Boom!

07:58.136 --> 07:59.537
60 seconds to go!

07:59.571 --> 08:01.238
Little bit more sugar.
Little bit.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.773
There's no more sugar.

08:02.808 --> 08:04.842
Guys, make sure each
and every one of you

08:04.876 --> 08:06.377
tastes that lemonade.

08:06.411 --> 08:07.745
That is what I'm judging.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.747
All about the taste.
Let's go.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.515
Way too sour.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.818
- Ten, nine...
- Keep stirring!

08:13.852 --> 08:15.987
- Eight, seven...
- No, no, no, no, no!

08:16.021 --> 08:17.989
- Six, five...
- Add some more water!

08:18.023 --> 08:19.557
- Four...
- Taste, taste, taste.

08:19.591 --> 08:21.058
Oh, my gosh, that's perfect.
Mix it.

08:21.093 --> 08:22.727
Two, one, and stop.

08:22.761 --> 08:24.629
That's good.

08:28.033 --> 08:30.635
Christina, please
take your position

08:30.669 --> 08:34.371
for this incredible blind
lemonade taste test.

08:34.405 --> 08:38.009
Teams, take your delicious
raspberry mint lemonade

08:38.043 --> 08:39.243
up to Christina, please.

08:39.278 --> 08:41.578
- Thank you.
- That way, that way, that way.

08:41.613 --> 08:44.348
The blue team had
some communication issues,

08:44.383 --> 08:47.318
but it's all about taste,

08:47.352 --> 08:50.821
and ours tasted delicious.

08:54.860 --> 08:58.629
Let me just make sure
Christina can't see me.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.331
Here we go.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.134
- Now we won't know.
- Shh.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.504
It is now time
for the blind taste test.

09:06.538 --> 09:09.040
The winning team
moves on to the next stage

09:09.074 --> 09:10.208
of the competition.

09:10.242 --> 09:12.577
The losing team get hit
by a lemonade shower

09:12.611 --> 09:15.479
and face another challenge.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.914
Please, off you go.

09:16.949 --> 09:18.950
Okay.

09:23.155 --> 09:24.856
Get a lot of lemon.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.692
Nice balance of sugar,

09:27.726 --> 09:31.028
but not a lot
of raspberry or mint.

09:31.063 --> 09:33.598
It tastes more like
fresh lemonade.

09:33.632 --> 09:37.168
I don't know that I'd call it
raspberry mint lemonade.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.937
Okay, now I'm gonna go
to the one on my right.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.410
Hmm, definitely much different.

09:46.445 --> 09:48.279
You get, like, a good raspberry,

09:48.313 --> 09:50.248
and then it turns into lemonade

09:50.282 --> 09:51.816
with a little bit of mint.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.417
It's less about it being sweet

09:53.452 --> 09:55.653
and more about it tasting
like raspberry.

09:59.124 --> 10:01.559
Christina, please remove
your blindfold.

10:01.593 --> 10:04.629
Which lemonade do you prefer?

10:04.663 --> 10:06.831
The winning lemonade

10:06.865 --> 10:08.332
belongs to...

10:15.474 --> 10:18.276
- Yeah, baby!
- Congratulations, red team.

10:20.546 --> 10:22.546
Oh, no.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.682
Whoo-hoo!
Yes, we won!

10:24.716 --> 10:25.917
Yes!

10:25.951 --> 10:27.084
Yeah!

10:27.119 --> 10:28.196
Sorry, blue team.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.388
- It's gonna be cold.
- Oh, God.

10:31.557 --> 10:34.225
Ahh.

10:48.027 --> 10:51.696
The winning lemonade
belongs to...

10:54.900 --> 10:58.570
The red team!

10:58.604 --> 11:01.573
That means the blue team
have lost.

11:01.607 --> 11:03.842
- No.
- Yeah!

11:03.876 --> 11:05.176
Sorry, blue team.

11:05.211 --> 11:07.011
- It's gonna be cold.
- Oh, God.

11:08.547 --> 11:09.914
Ahh!

11:20.559 --> 11:23.361
Whoo-hoo! I get to keep
my clothes dry!

11:23.395 --> 11:25.196
Congratulations to the red team.

11:25.231 --> 11:26.865
You can watch the next challenge

11:26.899 --> 11:28.600
from the safety of the balcony,

11:28.634 --> 11:32.370
but before you head up
to the balcony...

11:32.404 --> 11:34.272
Mm-hmm, yeah, come on.

11:34.306 --> 11:36.708
Ha ha! You guys
are gonna get wet!

11:36.742 --> 11:38.943
Oh, no!

11:38.978 --> 11:40.044
Yes!

11:48.821 --> 11:50.855
All right, red team, blue team,

11:50.890 --> 11:53.258
look at the mess you've made
in our kitchen.

11:53.292 --> 11:55.093
Look at the mess you made!

11:55.127 --> 11:56.928
- Seriously?
- Agh!

11:56.962 --> 11:59.797
All of you very carefully
follow us

11:59.832 --> 12:01.699
so you can get all nice and dry.

12:01.734 --> 12:03.101
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

12:04.937 --> 12:06.271
It's so wet!

12:06.305 --> 12:08.373
I told you you could trust us.

12:08.407 --> 12:10.085
Not the first time I had
lemonade dumped on my head.

12:10.109 --> 12:11.576
Not the first time.

12:16.649 --> 12:18.283
- Let's go!
- Yay!

12:21.453 --> 12:24.088
After losing
the lemonade challenge,

12:24.123 --> 12:26.558
I'm kind of a little scared.

12:26.592 --> 12:28.860
Where are the judges?

12:28.894 --> 12:31.729
I really think that it's
gonna be something very hard,

12:31.764 --> 12:35.834
and I'm hoping we don't have
to cook anything crazy.

12:35.868 --> 12:37.769
Uh, this can't be good.

12:37.803 --> 12:39.571
Where are they?
I mean, seriously.

12:39.605 --> 12:42.307
It's all groovy, man.

12:42.341 --> 12:44.676
Huh?

12:44.710 --> 12:46.311
Yeah, man.

12:46.345 --> 12:49.080
Oh, my God.

12:49.115 --> 12:50.849
- Guys, shh.
- Everybody, shh.

12:50.883 --> 12:53.017
Groovy.

12:58.057 --> 13:00.191
Oh, my God!

13:11.504 --> 13:14.639
<i>What is Gordon Ramsay wearing?</i>

13:14.673 --> 13:16.474
He looks like a hippie.

13:16.508 --> 13:19.377
Does anybody know when people
used to dress like this?

13:19.411 --> 13:21.846
- Yes, the '70s!
- The '80s!

13:21.881 --> 13:26.384
People used to dress like this
in the swinging '60s, baby,

13:26.418 --> 13:28.553
the best decade of all.

13:28.587 --> 13:29.621
Do you know why?

13:29.655 --> 13:31.322
- Swag.
- The food.

13:31.357 --> 13:32.857
That's when I was born.

13:32.892 --> 13:34.659
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, you're 50?

13:34.693 --> 13:35.827
You're old!

13:35.861 --> 13:38.196
Just to clarify,
it was the late '60s.

13:38.230 --> 13:39.264
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, yeah.

13:39.298 --> 13:40.799
Okay?
Relax, baby.

13:40.833 --> 13:41.966
Yeah, totally.

13:42.001 --> 13:43.234
Has anybody seen Graham?

13:43.269 --> 13:44.769
No!

13:44.804 --> 13:47.005
Let's take it to the max.

13:47.039 --> 13:48.306
What?

13:48.340 --> 13:50.909
Ain't no thing
but a chicken wing.

13:50.943 --> 13:52.377
This is getting
really freaky now.

14:11.764 --> 14:14.165
Work it, man!

14:14.200 --> 14:16.301
Oh, my God, man.

14:16.335 --> 14:17.635
I was born in '77.

14:17.670 --> 14:21.406
The '70s is the best decade
of all time.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.107
Now has anyone seen Christina?

14:24.276 --> 14:26.010
Disco Graham.

14:26.045 --> 14:27.846
- Christina?
- Christina?

14:28.948 --> 14:30.281
Christina?

14:30.316 --> 14:31.749
Where is she?

14:31.784 --> 14:32.851
Where is she?

14:32.885 --> 14:35.253
Dude, take a chill pill.

14:37.623 --> 14:39.390
What on earth?

14:39.425 --> 14:40.859
Oh, my God!

14:42.895 --> 14:44.863
Oh, my gosh,
she's on roller skates.

14:44.897 --> 14:46.764
She's on roller skates, guys.

14:46.799 --> 14:48.600
Guys, she's on roller skates.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.101
God!

14:52.438 --> 14:54.539
O-M-G.

14:55.941 --> 14:58.376
I'm totally fine.

15:00.246 --> 15:02.547
I can't watch this!

15:02.581 --> 15:04.315
I cannot watch this!

15:04.350 --> 15:05.917
Whoa.

15:09.021 --> 15:11.556
The '80s clothes are weird.

15:11.590 --> 15:13.491
- Hey, guys.
- Love it.

15:13.526 --> 15:16.661
She wears underwear
outside her pants!

15:16.695 --> 15:17.762
What the heck?

15:17.797 --> 15:19.164
I was born in 1981.

15:19.198 --> 15:22.400
The '80s,
the best decade of all.

15:22.434 --> 15:23.735
Oh, gosh.

15:23.769 --> 15:25.837
Legit, bodacious, and rad.

15:25.871 --> 15:27.005
That's scary.

15:29.508 --> 15:32.043
- All right, red team.
- Yes, Chef.

15:32.077 --> 15:34.913
Because you made
the tastiest lemonade earlier,

15:34.947 --> 15:37.816
you will not have to cook
in this next challenge.

15:40.386 --> 15:42.120
Please, head up to the balcony,

15:42.154 --> 15:45.256
where you will get to enjoy
some ice cold lemonade.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.357
Yes!

15:46.392 --> 15:47.425
I'm in the top 12.

15:47.459 --> 15:49.060
<i>I'm one step closer to winning</i>

15:49.094 --> 15:51.429
100 grand.

15:51.464 --> 15:52.730
Cheers.

15:52.765 --> 15:54.666
I'm so gonna win
this competition.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.368
I'm gonna stay in
as long as I can stay in.

15:57.403 --> 16:00.138
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

16:00.172 --> 16:01.539
Okay, you seven,

16:01.574 --> 16:03.041
you will be cooking tonight,

16:03.075 --> 16:05.310
and unfortunately
after this next challenge

16:05.344 --> 16:08.847
we're gonna have to say
good-bye to two of you.

16:08.881 --> 16:11.216
Tonight you'll all be making

16:11.250 --> 16:13.785
a signature dish
from the swinging '60s.

16:17.356 --> 16:18.556
It is...

16:19.692 --> 16:22.660
A stunning duck à I'Orange.

16:22.695 --> 16:24.629
Yes.

16:24.663 --> 16:25.663
- What is that?
- What?

16:25.698 --> 16:27.165
Duck caramelized

16:27.199 --> 16:31.970
served over a bright,
fluorescent orange sauce.

16:32.004 --> 16:34.973
A classic French dish that
became so popular in the '60s.

16:35.007 --> 16:36.307
- Duck?
- What?

16:36.342 --> 16:37.675
Wow.

16:37.710 --> 16:38.710
- Excited?
- No.

16:38.744 --> 16:40.311
- No, Chef.
- No!

16:40.346 --> 16:41.379
Wait, wait, wait, guys.

16:41.413 --> 16:42.824
I don't know
about that dish, Gordon.

16:42.848 --> 16:44.182
It doesn't look flashy enough.

16:44.216 --> 16:45.350
Oh, yes!

16:45.384 --> 16:48.086
Seems a little dated.

16:50.456 --> 16:52.991
- Yes!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

16:53.025 --> 16:54.659
Peace out, Ramsay.

16:54.693 --> 16:56.294
I got a bad dish from the '70s

16:56.328 --> 17:00.665
that these cats
are gonna really dig.

17:00.699 --> 17:05.537
Now I got a fever
and the only prescription...

17:05.570 --> 17:08.039
is chicken Kiev.

17:08.073 --> 17:09.607
What?

17:09.642 --> 17:11.643
It's breaded chicken

17:11.676 --> 17:13.912
stuffed with funky
herb garlic butter.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.580
What's the thing sticking
out of it, the white thing?

17:16.615 --> 17:19.349
Topped with a gorgeous
paper cone

17:19.385 --> 17:20.685
to cover the bone.

17:20.719 --> 17:22.119
Delicious comfort food

17:22.154 --> 17:25.190
that people used to eat
all the time back in the '70s.

17:25.223 --> 17:26.558
Never heard of it in my life.

17:26.592 --> 17:29.761
This is what all of you
are gonna have to make tonight.

17:29.795 --> 17:30.962
- What?
- Oh, gosh.

17:30.996 --> 17:32.530
I don't know about that, guys.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.766
- Oh.
- Thank you, Christina.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.935
- Thank you.
- Christina, I love you.

17:36.969 --> 17:40.371
Both these dishes seem
just a little old-fashioned.

17:40.406 --> 17:41.973
- No.
- Come on.

17:42.007 --> 17:43.074
I agree.

17:43.108 --> 17:45.410
For this challenge
we need something legit

17:45.444 --> 17:46.644
from the '80s.

17:46.679 --> 17:48.146
Oh, God.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.649
I mean, the '80s is
the closest thing here to 2015,

17:51.684 --> 17:53.751
so it's gotta be
something I know.

17:53.786 --> 17:57.322
Now, in the '80s
food was big, over-the-top.

17:57.356 --> 17:58.957
No expense was spared.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.659
Under here I have, like,

18:01.694 --> 18:04.796
a totally righteous dish.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.734
Ohh.

18:11.537 --> 18:14.239
<i>Olive Garden has two
new mouthwatering appetizers,</i>

18:14.273 --> 18:15.573
<i>inspired by Logan,</i>

18:15.608 --> 18:17.475
MasterChef Junior's
<i>season two winner,</i>

18:17.510 --> 18:20.078
<i>and featuring Olive Garden's
famous breadsticks.</i>

18:20.112 --> 18:21.746
<i>Visit your local
Olive Garden now</i>

18:21.781 --> 18:24.682
<i>to vote for which appetizer
will stay on the menu.</i>

18:28.156 --> 18:31.525
Now, in the '80s,
food was big, over-the-top.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.160
No expense was spared.

18:34.262 --> 18:35.729
Under here I have, like,

18:35.764 --> 18:37.431
a totally righteous dish.

18:39.634 --> 18:41.535
Ohh.

18:41.570 --> 18:43.404
Surf and turf.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.573
Surf and turf.

18:45.607 --> 18:47.675
- I can work with this!
- We love you, Christina!

18:47.709 --> 18:49.877
Lobster and filet mignon.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.880
Now, back in the '80s,
lunch was for wimps.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.883
But by dinner
everybody was so hungry

18:55.917 --> 18:58.085
that they said greed was good.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.688
So in the '80s people ate
two expensive proteins

19:00.722 --> 19:02.790
on one plate.

19:02.824 --> 19:04.558
You good with that, guys?

19:04.593 --> 19:05.659
I ain't gonna argue.

19:05.694 --> 19:08.262
Me neither.
Surf and turf it is.

19:08.296 --> 19:09.263
Yes.

19:09.297 --> 19:11.232
You will each have just one hour

19:11.266 --> 19:14.034
to make us your
surf and turf dish.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.704
You'll find everything you need
to make those dishes

19:16.738 --> 19:18.038
in the limited pantry.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.474
In there, you'll find
things like lobster tails,

19:20.509 --> 19:22.409
filet, New York strip,

19:22.444 --> 19:24.879
fresh fruits and vegetables
and spices.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.414
It's time for you all
to go to your stations.

19:30.385 --> 19:32.953
I have a really good
surf and turf dish.

19:32.988 --> 19:35.122
It has a ton of elements,

19:35.157 --> 19:37.291
so this is my time to prove

19:37.325 --> 19:39.393
that I am an amazing chef.

19:39.427 --> 19:41.095
Are you guys ready to make us

19:41.129 --> 19:43.597
the greatest surf and turf dish
of your lives?

19:43.632 --> 19:45.432
Yes, Chef!

19:45.467 --> 19:50.337
Your one hour starts...

19:50.372 --> 19:51.772
now.

19:51.806 --> 19:53.073
Come on, guys!

19:54.209 --> 19:55.943
New York strip.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.078
Look at that beauty.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.680
They don't have any
black peppercorn.

19:59.714 --> 20:01.482
Peppercorn's green.
What the what?

20:01.516 --> 20:02.683
I'm a vegetarian,

20:02.717 --> 20:05.286
and I don't cook
lobster or steak.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.455
So I'm worried that I won't
cook these properly,

20:08.490 --> 20:11.025
but I'm hoping that it'll
come out okay.

20:15.397 --> 20:17.665
Right, an '80s classic,
surf and turf,

20:17.699 --> 20:18.999
and it's so delicious,

20:19.034 --> 20:21.202
but so many things
can go wrong with this one.

20:21.236 --> 20:22.636
- Oh, God.
- Right?

20:22.671 --> 20:25.339
I mean, we always say you cannot
hide behind things like this,

20:25.373 --> 20:27.675
because if one of them
is messed up, it's done.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.043
That's 50% of the dish.

20:32.547 --> 20:33.981
Oh, it's burning.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.317
Are you sure you're not
gonna set off the smoke alarm?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.222
Today I'm making
a pan-seared filet mignon

20:41.256 --> 20:43.624
with roasted parmesan potatoes

20:43.658 --> 20:46.160
with a beurre blanc lobster.

20:46.194 --> 20:47.494
Back home in New York,

20:47.529 --> 20:49.273
surf and turf is something
my family doesn't have,

20:49.297 --> 20:51.065
'cause we're not very close
to the ocean.

20:51.099 --> 20:52.399
So I'm a little bit worried,

20:52.434 --> 20:56.237
but I'm pretty sure
I can pull it off.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.572
I'm making
a New York style steak

20:58.607 --> 21:00.174
with a lobster sauce.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.876
I'm going to make this dish rad

21:01.910 --> 21:04.378
because I'm doing
a lobster cream sauce

21:04.412 --> 21:07.948
and a red wine sauce too.

21:07.983 --> 21:09.250
Just over ten minutes gone.

21:09.284 --> 21:11.719
49 minutes remaining!

21:13.255 --> 21:14.321
Hmm, okay.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.890
All right, Tae-Ho.

21:15.924 --> 21:18.325
An '80s classic, surf and turf.
How are you doing it?

21:18.360 --> 21:21.395
I'm doing filet of beef,
pan-seared medium rare,

21:21.429 --> 21:23.030
on top of a cauliflower mash

21:23.064 --> 21:25.666
with a creamy, spicy
lobster sauce.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.067
Did you use the sriracha?

21:27.102 --> 21:28.803
Yes, the sriracha
is gonna be used

21:28.837 --> 21:31.172
to give it the spice
in the sauce.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.383
How are you cooking the lobster?

21:32.407 --> 21:35.176
I'm going to boil it
five to seven minutes.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.610
Five to seven minutes.

21:36.645 --> 21:38.045
Wow, there's no salt in there.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.157
- That's bland.
- I'm sorry.

21:39.181 --> 21:40.447
Make sure you season things,

21:40.482 --> 21:41.659
'cause you've got
expensive ingredients,

21:41.683 --> 21:43.050
and you've not seasoned them.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.629
However, it's all about
how it tastes at the end.

21:44.653 --> 21:46.887
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

21:46.922 --> 21:49.089
All right, Addison,
what are you making?

21:49.124 --> 21:50.758
- I'm making a steak Diane.
- Okay.

21:50.792 --> 21:53.694
And I'm gonna take the lobster
and put it in a cream sauce

21:53.728 --> 21:54.828
that I just made.

21:54.863 --> 21:56.931
Okay. What else
is in the cream sauce?

21:56.965 --> 21:58.365
There's parsley.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.602
We have heavy cream and brandy.

22:01.636 --> 22:03.704
I have to flambé really quick,
so hold on.

22:03.738 --> 22:06.073
- Ooh.
- Oh, oh.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.808
Let's see.

22:07.843 --> 22:09.944
Whoa, Addison!

22:09.978 --> 22:11.378
Nice job, girl.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.379
Whoo!

22:12.414 --> 22:14.081
All right, good luck, Addison.

22:14.116 --> 22:16.150
- Thank you.
- Good job.

22:18.053 --> 22:19.687
Amaya, all right,
how are you feeling?

22:19.721 --> 22:22.256
I am feeling really,
really confident right now.

22:22.290 --> 22:23.801
This is a tough challenge,
surf and turf.

22:23.825 --> 22:24.859
What are you doing?

22:24.893 --> 22:26.193
I am making a filet mignon,

22:26.228 --> 22:27.228
green rice,

22:27.262 --> 22:30.731
with a half-boiled,
half-grilled lobster.

22:30.765 --> 22:31.932
Okay, good.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.068
With my secret garlic sauce.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.836
- What's in there?
- It's secret!

22:35.871 --> 22:37.338
- Seriously?
- Yes.

22:37.372 --> 22:38.539
- Seriously?
- Yes.

22:38.573 --> 22:39.940
All right, young lady,
good luck.

22:39.975 --> 22:41.609
Thank you.

22:41.643 --> 22:44.545
23 minutes remaining.

22:44.579 --> 22:46.647
Oh, crap, my potatoes.

22:48.517 --> 22:49.483
That's about it.

22:49.518 --> 22:51.051
Ah.

22:51.086 --> 22:53.154
Zac!

22:53.188 --> 22:55.256
- You okay?
- Fudge.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.590
Zac has burned himself.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.693
Palm of your hand.

22:59.728 --> 23:01.862
Oh.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.582
23 minutes remaining.

23:07.616 --> 23:08.883
Ah.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.479
Zac!

23:11.559 --> 23:13.676
- You okay?
- Fudge.

23:13.756 --> 23:15.190
Zac has burned himself.

23:15.224 --> 23:17.659
He's shaking his hand.
You know he's in pain.

23:17.693 --> 23:19.327
Palm of your hand.

23:19.361 --> 23:22.630
My hand is on fire right now,

23:22.665 --> 23:25.800
but I have to use every
little bit of mental strength

23:25.834 --> 23:29.237
in my body
to get this dish done.

23:29.271 --> 23:30.315
All right, Zac,
how you doing, bud?

23:30.339 --> 23:31.349
I'm good, Chef.
How are you?

23:31.373 --> 23:32.784
Well, thank you.
Now, how's the burn?

23:32.808 --> 23:34.976
Um, it's okay.
It just stings a lot.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.645
Whenever you've taken a pan
out of the oven like that,

23:37.680 --> 23:39.280
cover it with a bit
of salt or flour,

23:39.315 --> 23:40.592
- or put something on there...
- Yes.

23:40.616 --> 23:42.116
So that every time
you see the handle,

23:42.151 --> 23:44.229
you know not to touch it,
'cause it's piping hot, yes?

23:44.253 --> 23:45.453
- Yes, Chef.
- Right.

23:45.487 --> 23:46.665
Talk me through the dish.
What are you doing?

23:46.689 --> 23:48.122
I'm doing a pan-seared
filet mignon

23:48.157 --> 23:49.724
and basted lobster tail

23:49.758 --> 23:52.694
with a parsnip purée,
parsnip crisps,

23:52.728 --> 23:53.862
potato fondant,

23:53.896 --> 23:55.463
and then I'm doing
the reduction.

23:55.497 --> 23:57.642
Are you gonna get all this done
in that time, young man?

23:57.666 --> 23:59.367
Yes, Chef.
I really want to do this,

23:59.401 --> 24:00.835
'cause I want
to impress you guys.

24:00.870 --> 24:01.910
Just gotta muscle through.

24:01.937 --> 24:03.177
Wow, and somebody's going home,

24:03.205 --> 24:04.339
so be careful, all right?

24:04.373 --> 24:05.340
Yes, Chef.

24:05.374 --> 24:07.442
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

24:08.811 --> 24:10.545
Nope.

24:10.579 --> 24:11.913
- Mia, how we doing?
- Great.

24:11.947 --> 24:13.815
So you're a vegetarian,
from Texas.

24:13.849 --> 24:15.650
I want to know about
your surf and turf.

24:15.684 --> 24:17.452
Okay, so I made
a steak au poivre

24:17.486 --> 24:19.587
with green peppercorn,
cream Brussels sprouts,

24:19.622 --> 24:21.756
and then just a traditionally
poached lobster

24:21.790 --> 24:22.824
with a butter sauce.

24:22.858 --> 24:23.992
This right here?

24:24.026 --> 24:25.370
Are you gonna serve that
as a sauce?

24:25.394 --> 24:26.795
- Yes.
- Okay. It's broken though.

24:26.829 --> 24:28.139
I mean, that's not
a butter sauce, right?

24:28.163 --> 24:29.441
- That's just like...
- Melted butter.

24:29.465 --> 24:32.333
- Melted butter.
- Yeah.

24:32.368 --> 24:34.903
Mia, two people
are going home tonight.

24:34.937 --> 24:36.137
So you have five minutes left

24:36.172 --> 24:37.349
to really bring
this dish together.

24:37.373 --> 24:38.416
Yeah, I gotta fix
this butter sauce.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.541
Good luck.

24:39.575 --> 24:41.709
You guys got this!
Whoo!

24:43.612 --> 24:45.980
Last five minutes.
Let's go.

24:46.015 --> 24:48.016
Right, unfortunately
Zac has burned himself,

24:48.050 --> 24:49.150
but the guy's incredible.

24:49.185 --> 24:51.019
So determined to impress
all three of us.

24:51.053 --> 24:52.697
If he can pull this off,
it's gonna be a miracle.

24:52.721 --> 24:54.455
- Yeah.
- Ow, ooh. Aghh!

24:54.490 --> 24:56.758
- I'm worried about Mia.
- Mm-hmm.

24:56.792 --> 24:59.561
She's vegetarian,
so I worry that her technique

24:59.595 --> 25:02.030
in cooking both a filet
and a lobster tail,

25:02.064 --> 25:03.531
- she may struggle with.
- Mm-hmm.

25:03.566 --> 25:05.467
Use your scissors!

25:05.501 --> 25:08.369
And my other issue is
she's making a butter sauce.

25:08.404 --> 25:10.371
Gordon, it was just
melted butter.

25:10.406 --> 25:11.716
Yeah, and it wasn't
even clarified.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.475
- Oh, dear.
- Yay, lobster's done.

25:13.509 --> 25:15.076
I'm seriously nervous
about Tae-Ho.

25:15.110 --> 25:18.112
He said he's making mayonnaise
and finishing it with sriracha.

25:18.147 --> 25:21.683
You would not take
a cheap, hot sauce

25:21.717 --> 25:24.118
and douse a lobster
and a filet mignon.

25:24.153 --> 25:25.286
No.

25:27.656 --> 25:30.959
75 seconds to go, guys.

25:30.993 --> 25:32.894
Taste everything, please.

25:32.928 --> 25:35.263
I think it needs something.

25:35.297 --> 25:36.831
It's good.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.433
Guys, come on!
You can do it!

25:38.467 --> 25:41.803
Ten, nine, eight,

25:41.837 --> 25:44.706
seven, six, five,

25:44.740 --> 25:47.208
four, three,

25:47.243 --> 25:48.710
two, one.

25:48.744 --> 25:49.744
- And stop.
- Stop.

25:49.778 --> 25:51.012
Hands in the air.

25:51.046 --> 25:52.981
- Well done.
- All right.

25:53.015 --> 25:54.983
Whoo!

25:55.017 --> 25:58.019
Guys, that was
a very difficult challenge.

25:58.053 --> 26:00.054
They look decadent from here.

26:00.089 --> 26:02.123
Let's find out how they taste.

26:02.157 --> 26:04.058
First up, Addison.
Please, let's go.

26:04.093 --> 26:06.895
I think I have a great dish.

26:06.929 --> 26:08.129
Whoo!

26:08.163 --> 26:09.608
And I really think
that they should rename it

26:09.632 --> 26:13.668
the steak Addison,
'cause it's awesome, like me.

26:15.604 --> 26:18.273
Wow, describe the dish, please.

26:18.307 --> 26:20.408
I made a steak Diane

26:20.442 --> 26:22.143
will grilled asparagus

26:22.178 --> 26:24.312
with a stuffed lobster shell.

26:24.346 --> 26:26.014
Now, date of birth?

26:26.048 --> 26:27.682
- 2005.
- 2005.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.518
How on earth do you know
about steak Diane?

26:30.553 --> 26:32.687
Um, YouTube.

26:34.757 --> 26:37.125
Lobster gratin
and a steak Diane.

26:37.159 --> 26:38.126
How have we cooked the steak?

26:38.160 --> 26:39.237
What temperature we going for?

26:39.261 --> 26:40.361
Medium rare, Chef.

26:40.396 --> 26:42.864
And it is medium rare.

26:47.002 --> 26:48.970
Steak Diane, delicious.
Lobster, delicious.

26:49.004 --> 26:50.839
Does it need two cream sauces?
Not really.

26:50.873 --> 26:52.640
However, young lady, yet again,

26:52.675 --> 26:54.275
another victory for Addison.

26:54.310 --> 26:56.811
Thank you, Chef.

26:56.845 --> 26:59.047
The lobster, you took it
out of the shell,

26:59.081 --> 27:00.515
mixed it with what?

27:00.549 --> 27:02.383
A cream sauce, which is just

27:02.418 --> 27:05.853
brandy, shallots,
garlic, parsley,

27:05.888 --> 27:08.223
and Dijon mustard.

27:08.257 --> 27:10.191
The flavors are great.

27:10.226 --> 27:12.494
If anything, take that lobster
with the cheese on it,

27:12.528 --> 27:14.596
throw it into the oven,
let it gratiné,

27:14.630 --> 27:16.498
get nice and bubbly
and brown and golden.

27:16.532 --> 27:17.709
But again,
the cook on the steak,

27:17.733 --> 27:19.400
the sauce, the lobster,

27:19.435 --> 27:21.202
everything on it
is seasoned great

27:21.237 --> 27:22.537
and cooked beautifully.

27:22.571 --> 27:24.205
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

27:25.741 --> 27:27.175
Great job, Addison!

27:27.209 --> 27:30.211
They absolutely loved my dish.

27:30.246 --> 27:34.315
I mean, I hit the 1980s
out of the ballpark.

27:36.385 --> 27:38.520
Next up, Tae-Ho.

27:38.554 --> 27:41.122
I know how to cook lobster,

27:41.156 --> 27:44.526
so I know for a fact
my lobster is cooked perfectly.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.329
So hopefully my surf and turf
becomes a 2015 classic.

27:48.364 --> 27:50.999
Tae-Ho, describe
the dish, please.

27:51.033 --> 27:54.502
I made a dynamite lobster
torn up

27:54.537 --> 27:57.138
with a sriracha mayo lemon sauce

27:57.173 --> 28:00.441
on top of a delicious
pan-seared filet mignon

28:00.476 --> 28:03.611
on a bed of
cauliflower spinach mash.

28:04.713 --> 28:06.247
Now, young man,

28:06.282 --> 28:10.852
if you were in
one of my kitchens tonight,

28:10.886 --> 28:13.521
you would've been fired.

28:21.392 --> 28:23.093
Now, young man,

28:23.127 --> 28:27.197
if you were in
one of my kitchens tonight,

28:27.232 --> 28:29.733
you would've been fired.

28:33.027 --> 28:34.661
Because you just don't
put sriracha,

28:34.695 --> 28:36.529
a store-bought sauce,

28:36.564 --> 28:39.999
something so powerful,
in a mayonnaise,

28:40.034 --> 28:42.268
and then douse it over
the best lobster

28:42.303 --> 28:44.871
and the best filet mignon.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.510
Now, visually, you can see

28:50.544 --> 28:52.178
the filet mignon's
overcooked, right?

28:52.213 --> 28:54.981
Mm-hmm, on the outside,
yes, it is.

28:55.015 --> 28:56.115
Why would you put spinach

28:56.150 --> 28:57.750
in that cauliflower purée
at the end?

28:57.785 --> 28:59.686
I guess I may have
just blanked out

28:59.720 --> 29:02.155
when I was thinking
about adding spinach

29:02.189 --> 29:03.656
in the cauliflower purée.

29:03.691 --> 29:05.725
Because a spinach
and cauliflower purée

29:05.759 --> 29:06.893
doesn't happen.

29:06.927 --> 29:08.228
Okay.

29:08.262 --> 29:09.696
Mm-hmm.

29:09.730 --> 29:12.031
What you have got right
is the cook on the lobster.

29:12.066 --> 29:13.276
You've taken it
out of the shell.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.368
I got slightly upset with you

29:15.402 --> 29:17.170
when you were poaching it
in bland water.

29:17.204 --> 29:19.939
You then corrected that
and added salt.

29:19.974 --> 29:21.808
The cook on the lobster
you brought back

29:21.842 --> 29:23.176
to something delicious.

29:23.210 --> 29:24.544
Thank you, Chef.

29:24.578 --> 29:27.146
- Thank you.
- Okay.

29:30.851 --> 29:33.152
All right, next up, Zac.

29:35.055 --> 29:37.056
Even though I burnt my hand

29:37.091 --> 29:38.758
and I barely finished,

29:38.792 --> 29:40.493
at least it's all on the plate.

29:40.527 --> 29:43.163
I just hope that everything
tastes delicious.

29:43.197 --> 29:46.099
Thank you.

29:46.133 --> 29:51.237
So, Zac, 60 minutes was like
a battlefield for you.

29:51.272 --> 29:54.274
Yeah, rough day for me.

29:54.308 --> 29:55.408
What's the dish?

29:55.442 --> 29:57.644
This is a pan-seared
filet mignon

29:57.678 --> 30:00.513
with a boiled and then
basted lobster tail

30:00.547 --> 30:05.218
with a parsnip purée,
served with a potato fondant.

30:05.252 --> 30:08.288
Let's get down to business.

30:08.322 --> 30:11.691
What are you hoping for on
the cook of your filet mignon?

30:11.725 --> 30:14.828
Medium rare.

30:14.862 --> 30:17.363
The moment of truth.

30:18.899 --> 30:21.734
Oh, it's perfect.

30:21.769 --> 30:24.504
You got beautiful color
on the outside there,

30:24.538 --> 30:27.440
considering how nice
and pink you kept the center.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.409
- Zac, that's perfect.
- Great job.

30:29.443 --> 30:31.644
Thank you.

30:33.247 --> 30:35.048
Great seasoning
across the board.

30:35.082 --> 30:36.549
- Thank you.
- Execution cookery

30:36.584 --> 30:39.986
of both that lobster tail
and that filet mignon, pro.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.688
If I were still wearing
my roller skates

30:41.722 --> 30:43.756
and my amazing neon
workout outfit,

30:43.791 --> 30:47.760
I would tell you that this
is one bodacious surf and turf.

30:47.795 --> 30:49.696
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

30:49.730 --> 30:51.231
Amaya.

30:52.299 --> 30:54.400
Please, describe your dish.

30:54.435 --> 30:59.005
I have a filet mignon
with a lobster,

30:59.039 --> 31:02.909
green rice, and
my secret garlic sauce.

31:05.412 --> 31:08.948
Don't put too much, it's very,
very, very, very strong.

31:08.983 --> 31:10.083
Oh, the garlic sauce?

31:10.117 --> 31:12.252
Yes.

31:16.190 --> 31:17.624
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yes.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.259
What, do you think
that we're vampires?

31:19.293 --> 31:20.393
No.

31:20.427 --> 31:21.671
What are you trying to do
with that thing?

31:21.695 --> 31:24.063
No, it's supposed to be
with the rice.

31:24.098 --> 31:25.475
Oh, well, why don't
you tell me that

31:25.499 --> 31:28.034
when I'm eating it with a steak?

31:28.068 --> 31:29.135
I'm sorry.

31:29.170 --> 31:31.204
So the steak, under.

31:31.238 --> 31:33.640
The lobster, amazing.

31:33.674 --> 31:34.874
I love the grill marks,

31:34.909 --> 31:36.976
the smokiness on that,
the color.

31:37.011 --> 31:39.078
The sauce, you need to
tone it down a little.

31:39.113 --> 31:40.113
Okay.

31:40.147 --> 31:41.581
But all in all, great flavor.

31:41.615 --> 31:42.759
- Thank you.
- Good job, Amaya.

31:42.783 --> 31:43.783
Mia.

31:43.818 --> 31:44.961
Come on, Mia!
You can do this!

31:44.985 --> 31:47.153
Go, Mia!

31:47.187 --> 31:48.621
Describe the dish, please.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.823
So you have a green peppercorn
steak au poivre

31:50.858 --> 31:52.192
with creamed Brussels sprouts

31:52.226 --> 31:54.327
and a traditionally
boiled lobster

31:54.361 --> 31:56.496
with a lemon clarified butter.

31:56.530 --> 31:57.830
Did you clarify the butter?

31:57.865 --> 31:59.299
Yes.

31:59.333 --> 32:02.135
'Cause it's got a lot of fat
down in the bottom there.

32:02.169 --> 32:04.504
- It's melted.
- Melted.

32:04.538 --> 32:06.906
The lobster, you can see already

32:06.941 --> 32:07.907
how undercooked that is.

32:07.942 --> 32:09.709
Yes.

32:09.743 --> 32:12.645
So I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna eat that.

32:13.914 --> 32:17.150
The filet,
nice sear on the outside.

32:17.184 --> 32:18.284
Oh, dear.

32:18.319 --> 32:20.820
So that's closer to rare.

32:23.624 --> 32:24.657
Mm.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.059
Sprouts are lovely,

32:26.093 --> 32:28.294
but unfortunately the lobster
and the filet mignon

32:28.329 --> 32:29.662
are both undercooked.

32:29.697 --> 32:32.465
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.833
Since I'm a vegetarian,

32:33.867 --> 32:36.035
I don't really cook lobster
or steak,

32:36.070 --> 32:37.770
and it just didn't come out,
I guess,

32:37.805 --> 32:39.672
the way I wanted it to.

32:39.707 --> 32:43.810
I don't think they're gonna
accept that I messed up twice.

32:43.844 --> 32:47.714
Next surf and turf from Kaitlyn.

32:50.384 --> 32:52.385
All right, Miss Kaitlyn,

32:52.419 --> 32:53.653
tell me what we have.

32:53.687 --> 32:56.256
What you have is a lobster
cooked in a beurre blanc sauce

32:56.290 --> 32:57.757
with a filet mignon

32:57.791 --> 32:59.392
with a balsamic drizzle,

32:59.426 --> 33:00.827
parmesan roasted potatoes

33:00.861 --> 33:03.096
and fried baby Brussels sprouts.

33:03.130 --> 33:07.066
This looks about as great
as it sounds.

33:07.101 --> 33:09.369
So what are we
looking for temp-wise?

33:09.403 --> 33:11.571
Medium rare.

33:13.541 --> 33:15.375
I mean, that right there is

33:15.409 --> 33:17.277
a pretty textbook cook
on a steak.

33:17.311 --> 33:18.278
Stunning.

33:18.312 --> 33:19.846
You've got sear,

33:19.880 --> 33:21.681
color on both sides,

33:21.715 --> 33:23.183
beautiful pink in the middle.

33:27.421 --> 33:28.655
Great flavor.

33:28.689 --> 33:30.156
You basted it with herbs.

33:30.191 --> 33:31.324
What is that, rosemary?

33:31.358 --> 33:32.392
Rosemary and thyme.

33:32.426 --> 33:34.027
Mm-hmm.
Comes through.

33:34.061 --> 33:37.397
I am really proud of you
for being able to nail that.

33:37.431 --> 33:38.875
It's a lot of technique,
skill, seasoning,

33:38.899 --> 33:39.866
and you nailed it.

33:39.900 --> 33:41.668
- Thank you, Chef.
- Good job.

33:41.702 --> 33:43.570
So talk me through the lobster.

33:43.604 --> 33:45.371
For the lobster,
I just boiled it

33:45.406 --> 33:47.373
for about four minutes

33:47.408 --> 33:49.409
and then put it
in my beurre blanc sauce,

33:49.443 --> 33:52.145
which was shallots,
garlic, white wine,

33:52.179 --> 33:53.780
heavy cream, and butter.

33:53.814 --> 33:54.981
How did yours come out?

33:55.015 --> 33:57.083
Definitely not as good
as my mom's,

33:57.117 --> 33:58.284
but pretty good.

33:58.319 --> 34:00.086
Mmm.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.089
If yours is pretty good compared
to your mom's beurre blanc,

34:03.123 --> 34:05.859
then I want to come over
for dinnertime

34:05.893 --> 34:07.193
the next time that's served up,

34:07.228 --> 34:08.828
because your beurre blanc

34:08.862 --> 34:10.474
is one of the most delicious
that I've tasted.

34:10.498 --> 34:11.664
Thank you, Chef.

34:11.699 --> 34:14.967
You totally took this 1980s dish

34:15.002 --> 34:17.469
and brought it into 2015

34:17.505 --> 34:19.304
with such elegance.

34:19.340 --> 34:20.684
And those fried
Brussels sprouts on top

34:20.708 --> 34:22.074
are the perfect finish

34:22.109 --> 34:24.010
to this very modernized
surf and turf dish.

34:24.043 --> 34:25.011
Good job.

34:25.045 --> 34:26.646
Thank you, Chef.

34:26.679 --> 34:27.847
Good job, Kaitlyn.

34:27.882 --> 34:30.283
Good job, Kaitlyn.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.018
That was good.
Hit it lightly.

34:34.221 --> 34:38.123
Last up, the surf and turf
from Corey.

34:38.158 --> 34:39.159
Yay.

34:40.293 --> 34:41.960
I've made surf and turf before,

34:41.996 --> 34:44.429
so I'm very confident
about my dish.

34:44.465 --> 34:47.167
I mean, my steak
is cooked very well,

34:47.201 --> 34:49.435
and my lobster tastes amazing.

34:49.469 --> 34:51.638
Wow, Corey, it looks
nice and artsy.

34:51.672 --> 34:52.806
Thank you.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.440
I think this will be
my way up to the top.

34:55.476 --> 34:57.443
So tell me, what is the dish?

34:57.478 --> 35:00.079
Well, I have
a New York strip steak

35:00.114 --> 35:02.415
with a red wine sauce

35:02.449 --> 35:03.950
on a bed of asparagus

35:03.984 --> 35:07.153
and lobster with
a lobster Creole sauce.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.956
When you're cooking a steak,

35:09.990 --> 35:12.225
be it a filet mignon,
New York strip,

35:12.259 --> 35:13.726
rib eye, what have you,

35:13.761 --> 35:15.862
you're looking
for what temperature?

35:15.896 --> 35:17.730
Medium rare.

35:17.765 --> 35:18.998
Medium rare.

35:19.033 --> 35:23.303
What temperature
would you say we have?

35:23.337 --> 35:25.038
Um, a little past medium.

35:25.072 --> 35:27.473
I would agree.

35:30.344 --> 35:33.213
The thing is, with the steak
and the lobster as the heroes,

35:33.247 --> 35:35.292
you really want to make sure
that those things are perfect.

35:35.316 --> 35:38.084
Steak, seasoned well
but completely overcooked.

35:38.118 --> 35:39.519
Let's see the lobster.

35:55.837 --> 35:57.371
Let's see the lobster.

36:10.618 --> 36:12.452
Try this for me real quick.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.228
Can't really taste the lobster.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.231
How's it taste?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.732
A little salty.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.535
Yes.
Very salty.

36:28.570 --> 36:30.370
That's why you don't taste
the lobster,

36:30.405 --> 36:32.206
'cause you taste the salt.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.574
Right?
When you season something,

36:33.608 --> 36:34.885
all you're doing
is adding a little

36:34.909 --> 36:36.443
so that it tastes
more like itself.

36:36.477 --> 36:38.645
A little bit of salt makes
it taste like super lobster.

36:38.680 --> 36:44.251
Here I taste salt and I'm
dying for a glass of water.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.419
The sauce, great sauce work.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.820
The vegetables are cooked nice.

36:46.854 --> 36:48.922
It's a great concept for a dish.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.134
I mean, if I saw it I'd be like,

36:50.158 --> 36:51.769
"That looks really pretty.
I want to try that."

36:51.793 --> 36:53.760
But you really, really
need to make sure

36:53.795 --> 36:55.195
that you taste, taste.

36:55.230 --> 36:56.740
If you need to, you can
add a little more salt,

36:56.764 --> 36:58.375
add a little more,
but you can't take it out

36:58.399 --> 36:59.733
once it's in there.

36:59.767 --> 37:02.569
So next time
focus on that, okay?

37:02.604 --> 37:03.570
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

37:03.604 --> 37:05.072
Thank you.

37:05.106 --> 37:07.207
I am seriously
embarrassed right now.

37:07.241 --> 37:09.409
I mean, my lobster
was too salty.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.978
My steak was
a little overcooked.

37:11.012 --> 37:13.914
Those are two huge mistakes.

37:13.948 --> 37:17.150
Ugh! I'm not ready
to go home at all.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.421
That was a very
difficult challenge tonight.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.290
We were all very impressed

37:23.324 --> 37:25.859
by how well
you did this evening.

37:25.893 --> 37:30.097
But unfortunately
it is an elimination challenge.

37:30.131 --> 37:31.865
And sadly,
we have to say good-bye

37:31.900 --> 37:34.434
to a few of you tonight.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.971
We'll be back shortly.
Thank you.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.340
Zac, you guys did a good job.

37:40.375 --> 37:41.875
Thanks.

37:41.909 --> 37:43.710
- Zac, I mean, one hand down.
- Yeah.

37:43.745 --> 37:45.489
His lobster
was cooked beautifully.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.880
His filet was
cooked beautifully.

37:46.914 --> 37:48.259
Yeah, Kaitlyn as well,
the finesse.

37:48.283 --> 37:50.484
That's the first time
I've seen a dish

37:50.518 --> 37:51.962
that I would love
to put in my restaurant.

37:51.986 --> 37:53.387
I think the three of us
are safe.

37:53.421 --> 37:55.222
Definitely, but I don't...

37:55.256 --> 37:58.191
I don't know about Mia.

37:58.226 --> 38:00.294
Mia, underwhelming,
and also the lobster was raw.

38:00.328 --> 38:01.739
Guys, I couldn't get it
out of the shell.

38:01.763 --> 38:02.896
- No.
- I think I failed.

38:02.931 --> 38:04.031
Everything was messed up.

38:04.065 --> 38:05.265
I think you did okay.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.577
Tae-Ho, a bit
of a disaster there.

38:06.601 --> 38:09.069
You gave me a sriracha dish
with a side of lobster.

38:09.103 --> 38:10.404
Totally.

38:10.438 --> 38:12.316
Corey, I loved the fact that
he tried to elevate it

38:12.340 --> 38:13.807
with a New York strip,
which is hard.

38:13.842 --> 38:15.642
The dish looked beautiful,
but you taste it...

38:15.677 --> 38:17.711
I almost had to spit
the lobster out.

38:17.745 --> 38:19.146
I don't want to go.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.981
- We agree?
- Totally.

38:27.989 --> 38:30.924
All right, everyone,
please come down to the front.

38:38.032 --> 38:41.602
Tonight we gave you
a really hard challenge,

38:41.636 --> 38:46.006
taking a dish from
the ancient 1980s

38:46.040 --> 38:49.943
and turning it into
a cool, contemporary dish

38:49.978 --> 38:51.879
to represent 2015.

38:51.913 --> 38:56.717
Now some of you
absolutely excelled,

38:56.751 --> 38:58.785
and one home cook in particular

38:58.820 --> 39:00.420
turned out a plate
that we could feature

39:00.455 --> 39:02.923
in any of our restaurants.

39:03.958 --> 39:06.193
Congratulations, Kaitlyn.

39:06.227 --> 39:07.895
Good job.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.897
- Whoo!
- Good job, Kaitlyn.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.365
- Good job.
- Good job, Kaitlyn.

39:11.399 --> 39:13.634
That said,
you are going nowhere,

39:13.668 --> 39:15.903
except upstairs to
the safety of the balcony.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.037
Good job.
Off you go.

39:17.071 --> 39:18.872
Well done.

39:18.907 --> 39:20.307
I'm so happy that I won

39:20.341 --> 39:22.209
'cause I make it through
to the next round.

39:22.243 --> 39:24.244
My goal in this competition
was top ten,

39:24.279 --> 39:26.380
and I am so close
to making it there.

39:28.683 --> 39:30.651
All right,
that leaves six of you.

39:30.685 --> 39:34.087
Would the following home cooks
please step forward?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.257
Amaya.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.761
Addison.

39:40.795 --> 39:41.828
Zac.

39:44.265 --> 39:45.866
You three home cooks,

39:45.900 --> 39:50.037
age 10, 9, and 12,

39:50.071 --> 39:53.574
are going...

39:53.608 --> 39:55.442
up to the balcony.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.844
You are all safe with
great dishes tonight.

39:57.879 --> 39:59.947
Oh, lord.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.081
Oh, lord.

40:06.176 --> 40:08.255
That leaves three talented,

40:08.289 --> 40:11.491
very accomplished
young home cooks.

40:12.802 --> 40:15.036
All three of you
worked extremely hard.

40:15.071 --> 40:18.173
Unfortunately
your dishes weren't on par

40:18.207 --> 40:19.908
with everybody else's.

40:23.079 --> 40:24.346
Corey...

40:28.451 --> 40:31.586
Young man, I would like you...

40:31.621 --> 40:32.798
to make your way
up to the balcony.

40:32.822 --> 40:34.089
Yes!

40:34.123 --> 40:35.890
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, you're safe.

40:35.925 --> 40:37.525
Thank you, sir.

40:40.763 --> 40:44.165
That means, unfortunately,
Mia and Tae-Ho,

40:44.200 --> 40:48.003
tonight is your last night
in the MasterChef kitchen.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.406
But remember what you've done,

40:51.440 --> 40:54.943
top 14 of the best
young home cooks

40:54.977 --> 40:57.078
anywhere in this country.

40:57.113 --> 41:01.149
Tae-Ho, what have you
learned so far

41:01.183 --> 41:02.917
in this incredible experience?

41:02.952 --> 41:05.153
I'm going home
with my head up high,

41:05.187 --> 41:06.955
'cause I learned a lot,

41:06.989 --> 41:10.091
and just more skill than I had
when I first came in.

41:10.126 --> 41:12.527
Good.
Mia, have you had fun?

41:12.561 --> 41:13.895
Yes, sir.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.031
And what's been a highlight
of your journey here

41:16.065 --> 41:17.165
in "MasterChef Junior"?

41:17.199 --> 41:19.334
Beating your head up
with a stick.

41:19.368 --> 41:20.935
Appreciate that.

41:23.305 --> 41:25.006
You've done very well,
both of you.

41:25.041 --> 41:26.241
Take care, guys.
Thank you.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.576
- Thank you, guys.
- Good night.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.411
Bye, you guys!
We're gonna miss you!

41:29.445 --> 41:31.313
- Keep cooking.
- You did great.

41:31.347 --> 41:32.647
You guys did great.

41:32.682 --> 41:35.150
I learned so much
in this competition.

41:35.184 --> 41:37.485
I'm just really happy
I got to have this experience.

41:40.323 --> 41:41.623
I'm really excited
to see my dad.

41:41.657 --> 41:42.957
He's gonna be so proud of me

41:42.992 --> 41:45.493
and all the meats
that I can cook for him now.

41:45.528 --> 41:47.629
I'm gonna go back to Austin,
I'm gonna keep cooking,

41:47.663 --> 41:48.964
I'm gonna open up my restaurant

41:48.998 --> 41:50.699
for vegetarians like me,

41:50.733 --> 41:52.767
and I just can't wait
for everyone to see

41:52.802 --> 41:55.036
what I accomplish
in the next couple years.

41:55.071 --> 41:56.705
Bye, guys.

41:56.739 --> 41:59.107
I'll never forget my time
here at "MasterChef."

41:59.141 --> 42:01.443
Meeting <i> the</i> Gordon Ramsay.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.179
He's my idol, he's the reason
I started cooking.

42:04.213 --> 42:05.714
Technically, you've nailed it.

42:05.748 --> 42:06.781
Thank you, Chef.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.116
Great job.
Well done.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.018
That is a huge honor for me.

42:10.052 --> 42:11.519
Yes!

42:12.688 --> 42:15.390
Dang, I cried.
Fail.

42:15.424 --> 42:16.558
<i>Next week...</i>

42:16.592 --> 42:19.294
- Ohh!
- A blindfold?

42:19.328 --> 42:20.662
<i>The top 12...</i>

42:20.696 --> 42:21.963
Hmm, what is this?

42:21.998 --> 42:23.408
<i>Have victory in their sights.</i>

42:23.432 --> 42:25.734
We only want a replica
of what Gordon made you.

42:25.768 --> 42:28.169
<i>But the toughest
mystery box of the season...</i>

42:28.204 --> 42:29.371
I can do this.

42:29.405 --> 42:32.073
<i>May leave some
junior home cooks in the dark.</i>

42:32.108 --> 42:33.908
I feel confused.

42:33.943 --> 42:35.543
- <i>And then...</i>
- Hurry!

42:35.578 --> 42:37.212
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

42:37.246 --> 42:39.281
<i>It's a team
challenge for the ages.</i>

42:39.315 --> 42:42.217
Please welcome your VIP guests.

42:42.251 --> 42:43.585
- What the...
- No way!

42:43.619 --> 42:45.520
We gotta really step it up.
