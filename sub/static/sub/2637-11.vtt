00:28.178 --> 00:30.112
- Checkmate.
- Aaarggh!

00:30.613 --> 00:31.671
Again?

00:31.848 --> 00:34.840
Obviously, you're not well suited
for three-dimensional chess.

00:35.018 --> 00:38.351
Perhaps three-dimensional Candy Land
would be more your speed.

00:38.888 --> 00:40.185
Just reset the board.

00:40.356 --> 00:44.417
It must be humbling to suck
on so many different levels.

00:50.433 --> 00:51.457
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.898
- Did you get my mail?
- Yeah, right here.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.528
- How was Nebraska?
- Well, better than North Dakota.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.240
I guess that joke's only funny
in Nebraska.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.884
From the data at hand,
you can't draw that conclusion.

01:09.052 --> 01:12.681
All you can say with absolute certainty
is that that joke is not funny here.

01:18.928 --> 01:20.486
Boy, it's good to be back.

01:21.698 --> 01:23.825
- How's your family?
- Oh, it was the worst trip.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.968
- Everyone got sick over the weekend.
- Sick?

01:26.136 --> 01:27.763
Here we go.

01:30.140 --> 01:33.041
- What kind of sick?
- Oh, the flu, I guess.

01:33.209 --> 01:35.302
I don't need you to guess,
I need you to know.

01:35.478 --> 01:37.912
Now, when did the symptoms
first appear?

01:38.081 --> 01:39.343
Maybe Friday.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.609
Friday. Was that morning or afternoon?

01:42.452 --> 01:44.181
- I don't-
- Think, woman.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.288
Who blew their nose and when?

01:46.890 --> 01:49.120
Sheldon, relax.
She doesn't have any symptoms.

01:49.292 --> 01:50.850
I'm sure she's not contagious.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.961
Oh, please.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.491
If influenza was only contagious
after symptoms appear...

01:56.666 --> 01:58.531
...it would've died out years ago.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.965
Somewhere between tool using
and cave painting...

02:01.137 --> 02:04.732
...Homo habilis would've figured out
to kill the guy with the runny nose.

02:05.341 --> 02:08.333
Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.

02:08.511 --> 02:09.705
That's okay. I understand.

02:09.878 --> 02:12.871
Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.

02:13.716 --> 02:17.243
You'd better go
before he starts spraying you with Lysol.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.354
Okay, well,
thank you for getting my mail.

02:19.522 --> 02:21.854
No, problem. Welcome home.

02:28.498 --> 02:30.125
What?

03:01.898 --> 03:03.627
What the hell are you doing?

03:03.800 --> 03:07.668
I'm making petri dishes
to grow throat cultures.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.397
With lime Jell-O?

03:09.572 --> 03:13.975
I need a growth medium, and someone
polished off the apricot yogurt.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.610
Here. Swab my throat.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.345
- I don't think so.
- Leonard.

03:21.517 --> 03:25.681
If I'm going to get ahead of this, I need
to find out what's growing in my throat.

03:27.257 --> 03:29.623
Sheldon, you are not sick.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.091
This is, but you are not.

03:33.529 --> 03:34.996
We have no idea what pathogen...

03:35.164 --> 03:37.758
...Typhoid Penny
has introduced into our environment.

03:37.934 --> 03:42.894
And having never been to Nebraska, I'm
certain I have no corn-husking antibodies.

03:45.842 --> 03:48.276
Sheldon, don't you think
you're overreacting?

03:48.444 --> 03:52.175
When I'm lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me...

03:52.348 --> 03:54.509
...these cultures
and my accompanying notes...

03:54.684 --> 03:56.914
...will give them a fighting chance.

04:01.024 --> 04:02.821
I'm going back to bed.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.961
- Wait, put this in the bathroom.
- What for?

04:06.129 --> 04:08.256
I need to measure
my fluid intake and output...

04:08.431 --> 04:10.695
...to make sure
my kidneys aren't shutting down.

04:12.435 --> 04:15.700
I mix pancake batter in this.

04:16.204 --> 04:19.402
No, that measuring cup
has always been for urine.

04:20.642 --> 04:23.339
You had time to make a label
for everything in this apartment...

04:23.513 --> 04:24.980
...including the label-maker...

04:25.148 --> 04:28.743
...but you didn't have 10 seconds
to make one that said, "Urine cup"?

04:30.286 --> 04:32.516
It's right here on the bottom.

04:36.225 --> 04:37.590
Huh.

04:39.529 --> 04:43.158
I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company
a letter of apology.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.676
Oh, dear God.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.648
Leonard.

05:05.688 --> 05:07.155
Leonard, I'm sick.

05:11.127 --> 05:12.287
Leonard.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.497
Leonard, I'm sick.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.866
Leonard.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.099
Leonard.

05:24.874 --> 05:26.671
Leonard.

05:28.644 --> 05:33.877
Leonard, my comforter fell down
and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

05:36.219 --> 05:37.914
Leonard?

05:44.861 --> 05:46.795
Ow.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.169
Hey.
- Leonard, where are you?

05:55.338 --> 05:57.306
I'm at work.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.668
At 6:30 in the morning?

06:00.510 --> 06:01.670
Yes.

06:02.211 --> 06:03.303
On Sunday?

06:04.514 --> 06:05.640
Yes.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.174
- Why?
- They asked me to come in.

06:08.551 --> 06:12.715
- Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
- They texted me.

06:13.523 --> 06:16.959
Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

06:17.126 --> 06:20.653
My fever has been tracking up
exponentially since 2 a. m...

06:20.830 --> 06:23.822
...and I am producing sputum
at an alarming rate.

06:26.369 --> 06:29.270
- No kidding.
- Nope. Not only that...

06:29.439 --> 06:33.239
...it has shifted from clear
to milky green.

06:33.409 --> 06:36.674
All right, well, get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

06:36.846 --> 06:41.681
What else would I drink?
Gases? Solids? lonized plasma?

06:42.251 --> 06:43.582
Drink whatever you want.

06:43.753 --> 06:46.051
- I want soup.
- Then make soup.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.918
- We don't have soup.
- I'm at work, Sheldon.

06:52.962 --> 06:56.193
- Is that a dog?
- Yes.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.856
- In the lab?
- Yes.

07:00.069 --> 07:03.004
They're training dogs
to operate the centrifuge...

07:03.172 --> 07:08.576
...for when they need dogs to operate
the centrifuge for blind scientists.

07:08.744 --> 07:10.109
I have to go.

07:13.616 --> 07:17.245
Howard, it's the phone.

07:18.387 --> 07:21.948
I know it's the phone, Ma.
I hear the phone.

07:22.125 --> 07:27.529
- Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?
- I don't know.

07:27.697 --> 07:31.793
Well, ask them why they're calling
at this ungodly hour.

07:31.968 --> 07:35.426
How can I ask them
when I'm talking to you?

07:39.175 --> 07:40.699
Hello?

07:41.010 --> 07:43.308
Howard, it's Leonard. Code milky green.

07:43.479 --> 07:47.745
- Dear Lord, not milky green.
- Affirmative. With fever.

07:47.917 --> 07:51.045
- Who's on the phone?
- It's Leonard.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.678
- Why is he calling?
- Sheldon's sick.

07:54.857 --> 07:57.724
Were you playing with him?

07:59.028 --> 08:01.758
For God's sake, Ma, I'm 26 years old.

08:01.931 --> 08:04.957
Excuse me, Mr. Grownup.

08:06.068 --> 08:11.199
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Chocolate milk and Eggos, please.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.802
- Howard, listen to me.
- Hang on. Call waiting.

08:13.976 --> 08:17.275
- No, don't- Don't-
- Hello?

08:17.446 --> 08:18.811
Howard, I'm sick.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.948
Howard's sleeping. This is his mother.

08:29.625 --> 08:34.028
Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?

08:34.462 --> 08:36.124
I need soup.

08:36.465 --> 08:38.831
Then call your own mother.

08:40.703 --> 08:41.965
It was Sheldon.

08:42.138 --> 08:44.231
- I tried to stop you.
- It's my own fault.

08:44.407 --> 08:48.867
I forgot the protocol we put in place
after the great ear infection of '06.

08:49.212 --> 08:50.236
You call Koothrappali.

08:50.413 --> 08:54.008
We need to find a place to lay low
for the next 18 to 24 hours.

08:54.183 --> 08:57.209
Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?

08:57.386 --> 09:01.550
I just had the carpet steamed.

09:02.024 --> 09:04.151
That's a negatory.

09:04.327 --> 09:07.421
But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon
at the Nuart today.

09:07.597 --> 09:10.589
Five movies, two hours apiece.

09:11.167 --> 09:13.158
It's a start.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.839
Homeless crazy guy at Table 18.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.738
No, just crazy.

09:27.617 --> 09:29.949
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

09:30.453 --> 09:33.684
I'm sick. Thank you very much.

09:33.856 --> 09:35.221
How could you've gotten it from me?

09:35.391 --> 09:37.325
- I'm not sick.
- You're a carrier.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.461
All these people here are doomed.

09:39.629 --> 09:42.063
- You're doomed.
- Shh!

09:43.833 --> 09:45.767
Sheldon, what do you want?

09:45.935 --> 09:47.766
I want soup.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.098
Why didn't you just-?

09:55.978 --> 09:57.741
Why didn't you just have soup at home?

09:58.247 --> 10:00.613
Penny, I have an IQ of 187.

10:00.783 --> 10:03.183
Don't you imagine
that if there were a way for me...

10:03.352 --> 10:06.321
...to have had soup at home,
I would have thought of it?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.221
You can have soup delivered.

10:12.662 --> 10:13.993
I did not think of that.

10:16.165 --> 10:18.463
Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.

10:18.634 --> 10:23.128
Please bring me some soup
while I still understand what a spoon is for.

10:23.306 --> 10:25.069
Okay. What kind of soup do you want?

10:25.241 --> 10:27.766
Well, my mother used to make me
this split-pea...

10:27.943 --> 10:32.073
...with little frankfurter slices
and these homemade croutons.

10:32.248 --> 10:34.739
We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.

10:35.685 --> 10:39.746
Can I get any of those with little
frankfurter slices and homemade croutons?

10:40.289 --> 10:41.722
No.

10:41.957 --> 10:43.788
Then surprise me.

10:53.536 --> 10:56.972
Would you call that moss green
or forest green?

11:10.653 --> 11:13.747
Look at this. Everyone went chimp.

11:14.457 --> 11:16.721
I'd like to point out, I voted for orangutan...

11:16.892 --> 11:18.450
...but you shouted me down.

11:22.965 --> 11:25.263
Oh, hi, Penny.
- Hey, where are you?

11:25.434 --> 11:28.733
I'm at work.

11:29.238 --> 11:30.330
You sound funny.

11:30.506 --> 11:34.374
Oh, I'm in a radiation suit.

11:34.543 --> 11:36.408
- What's up?
- Yeah, well, I'm at work too.

11:36.579 --> 11:39.776
And you'll never guess who's here
infecting my entire station.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.644
Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.851
- Just tell him to go home.
- Well, he won't leave.

11:45.020 --> 11:49.320
He says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus
and someone will harvest his organs.

11:49.992 --> 11:53.325
He's paranoid
and he's established a nest.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.387
Can you please come get him?

11:56.098 --> 11:59.090
Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to, Penny.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.628
Oh, my God,
there's a breach in the radiation unit.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.205
The whole city is in jeopardy.

12:05.374 --> 12:08.935
Oh, my God. Professor Guggenheim
is melting. Gotta go. Bye.

12:15.217 --> 12:18.550
- I feel really guilty.
You did what you had to do.

12:18.721 --> 12:21.690
HOWARD
Take your stinking paws off my popcorn...

12:21.857 --> 12:24.792
...you damn dirty ape.

12:29.131 --> 12:30.996
Thanks for bringing me home.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.431
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.

12:33.602 --> 12:36.469
It's not like I have rent
or car payments or anything.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.664
Good, good.

12:39.942 --> 12:41.933
Okay, well, you feel better.

12:42.111 --> 12:44.443
Wait. Where are you going?

12:45.047 --> 12:49.108
Um, home to write some bad checks.

12:50.085 --> 12:51.347
You're going to leave me?

12:51.921 --> 12:55.049
Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?

12:55.224 --> 12:58.455
Of course, but not by myself.

12:58.627 --> 13:00.390
Really? Never?

13:00.563 --> 13:03.691
Well, once, when I was 15
and spending the summer...

13:03.866 --> 13:05.993
...at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.804
- Studying abroad?
- No, visiting professor.

13:11.841 --> 13:16.005
Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more
sausage-based than I'm used to...

13:16.178 --> 13:18.305
...and the result
was an internal blitzkrieg...

13:18.481 --> 13:22.212
...with my lower intestine
playing the part of Czechoslovakia.

13:22.818 --> 13:24.979
And there was no one there
to take care of you?

13:25.154 --> 13:28.590
No, my mom had to fly back to Texas
to help my dad...

13:28.757 --> 13:32.488
...because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.754
- Again?
- It was tornado season.

13:35.931 --> 13:38.195
And it was an aluminum house.

13:39.668 --> 13:43.331
Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty
residence didn't speak any English.

13:43.506 --> 13:45.906
When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick...

13:46.075 --> 13:49.442
...she said,
"Möchtest du eine Darmspülung?"

13:49.845 --> 13:51.278
What does that mean?

13:51.447 --> 13:55.008
Based on what happened next, I assume
it means, "Would you like an enema? "

13:57.386 --> 14:01.379
Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.
What do you need?

14:01.557 --> 14:06.051
Well, my mom used to give me
sponge baths.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.458
Okay, ground rules:

14:13.636 --> 14:17.197
No sponge baths
and definitely no enemas.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.369
Agreed.

14:23.712 --> 14:27.273
Here we go.
Ten and a half hours of apey goodness.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.087
Damn it, my glasses.

14:33.656 --> 14:36.124
Okay, I'm blind here, guys.
Can you help me find them?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.123
- Sorry.
- Okay.

14:41.263 --> 14:42.457
Found them.

14:44.233 --> 14:47.168
- Oh, great.
- I'm sorry. Don't you have a spare?

14:47.336 --> 14:49.964
- Yeah, at home.
- If you leave now, you can be back...

14:50.139 --> 14:53.302
...before the gorillas whip
the crap out of Charlton Heston.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.533
Unless Sheldon's there.

14:54.710 --> 14:59.409
You'll be trapped forever
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.785
Hi, Penny?

15:08.958 --> 15:12.359
I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

15:13.896 --> 15:16.456
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

15:16.632 --> 15:19.931
Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

15:21.236 --> 15:22.635
He's home. I'm screwed.

15:25.407 --> 15:28.968
Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.

15:29.878 --> 15:31.675
How about Lasik?

15:32.815 --> 15:35.807
- You want me to get eye surgery?
- Would you rather go back...

15:35.985 --> 15:40.115
...and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger
carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

15:42.491 --> 15:44.618
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

15:46.128 --> 15:49.188
Okay, nice and cozy.

15:49.632 --> 15:52.658
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

15:53.502 --> 15:56.699
Will you please rub this on my chest?

15:57.539 --> 15:59.700
Oh, Sheldon. Can't you do that yourself?

15:59.875 --> 16:03.208
VapoRub makes my hands smell funny.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.212
- But, Sheldon-
- Please, please, please.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.149
I can't believe I'm doing this.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.656
No, no. Counterclockwise,
or my chest hair mats.

16:25.134 --> 16:26.499
Sorry.

16:31.473 --> 16:34.169
Can you sing "Soft Kitty"?

16:35.811 --> 16:36.835
What?

16:37.012 --> 16:39.503
My mom used to sing it to me
when I was sick.

16:39.682 --> 16:42.708
- I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
- I'll teach you.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.731
Now you.

17:18.487 --> 17:20.215
Keep rubbing.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.109
What do you see? What do you see?
I can't-

17:41.276 --> 17:44.507
- Living room appears to be empty.
- Okay, he must be in his bedroom.

17:44.680 --> 17:50.118
My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser, next to my bat signal.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.417
I'm not going in there.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.615
- Raj?
- No way, Jose.

17:55.924 --> 17:58.654
- But I can't do it. I can't see anything.
- It's all right.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.455
Wireless mini-cam
and Bluetooth headset.

18:01.630 --> 18:04.098
We'll be your eyes.

18:04.466 --> 18:07.094
- Fine.
- One more thing.

18:07.469 --> 18:11.803
This is a sub-sonic impact sensor.

18:11.974 --> 18:14.169
If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...

18:14.343 --> 18:16.971
...this will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

18:17.146 --> 18:20.946
At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...

18:21.116 --> 18:24.643
...you'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.515
Won't my footsteps set it off?

18:26.688 --> 18:29.054
No. You'll be on your hands and knees.

18:29.224 --> 18:31.988
Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.

18:32.161 --> 18:34.789
How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

18:40.169 --> 18:41.636
Stay low.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.569
Bear left.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.798
- Now keep true.
- What?

18:45.974 --> 18:49.137
- It means go straight.
- Then just say, "Go straight. "

18:49.645 --> 18:53.479
You don't say, "Go straight" when you're
giving bearings. You say, "Keep true. "

18:54.183 --> 18:55.844
All right.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.015
I just hit my head.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.551
Because you didn't keep true.

19:06.328 --> 19:08.558
Okay, turn right.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.189
The picture's breaking up.

19:11.366 --> 19:13.027
Angle your head to the right.

19:14.269 --> 19:16.169
Now, a little more.

19:16.338 --> 19:17.828
Little more.

19:18.340 --> 19:20.865
That's it. Now just keep true.

19:23.712 --> 19:27.512
All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

19:28.817 --> 19:30.512
Now, turn it on.

19:30.686 --> 19:33.211
- It wasn't on?
- No.

19:33.388 --> 19:35.356
Then why did I have to crawl?

19:36.758 --> 19:38.726
Oh, I guess you didn't.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.056
Okay, it's on.

19:43.232 --> 19:46.963
Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

19:48.237 --> 19:50.262
I know.

19:53.408 --> 19:55.103
Hang on,
the sensor's picking up something.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.972
Turn your head back.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.082
You rat bastard.

20:06.655 --> 20:08.782
Told you the sensor would work.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.118
Hi.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.318
You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

20:13.495 --> 20:15.861
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

20:16.031 --> 20:18.659
Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

20:19.401 --> 20:21.028
It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

20:21.203 --> 20:22.932
- Leonard's home.
- No.

20:23.105 --> 20:25.665
- Here you go, good luck, bye.
- Oh, wait, wait.

20:25.841 --> 20:30.608
Leonard? I'm hungry.
- Wait. Penny, take me with you.

20:34.950 --> 20:36.713
Leonard?

20:40.188 --> 20:42.088
I want grilled cheese.

21:00.742 --> 21:04.576
Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

21:05.514 --> 21:08.915
I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

21:11.553 --> 21:14.454
I'm very congested.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.283
Yeah? So?

21:17.459 --> 21:22.226
Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the turkey baster labeled, "Mucus"?

21:25.233 --> 21:28.361
If I stand, I'll vomit.

21:28.904 --> 21:31.896
Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.

21:32.305 --> 21:38.310
