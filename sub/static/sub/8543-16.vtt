[female narrator]
Previously on "The Mentalist.."

00:03.829 --> 00:05.701
Our fugitive
is a known associate

00:05.788 --> 00:08.051
of the serial killer,
Red John.

00:08.138 --> 00:11.315
'She's wanted for murder
conspiracy, kidnapping'

00:11.402 --> 00:12.621
'and weapons violations.'

00:12.708 --> 00:14.188
Lorelei has taken
a hostage.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.190
Need a ride?

00:16.277 --> 00:18.279
Lorelei hasn't contacted me
in years.

00:18.366 --> 00:23.066
I'm guessing you had a vain,
selfish and controlling mother.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.068
'And you found the strength
to pull away.'

00:25.155 --> 00:27.244
I sold Lorelei's sister.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.594
I don't remember reading
anything about a sister.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.684
[sobbing]
Miranda.
That was her name.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.077
Where is Miranda now?

00:34.164 --> 00:37.341
She's, she was murdered.
She's dead.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.388
Losing my sister brought me
into my full reality.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.216
- 'Nothing can hurt me.'
- It's nonsense.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.653
Believe me,
things can hurt you.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.959
Jane, what's going on?
Have you been kidnapped?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.831
Yes. I'm in fear of my life.

00:48.918 --> 00:51.094
I can't talk long.
What happened to Miranda?

00:51.181 --> 00:53.053
Before Miranda died,
she carved a message

00:53.140 --> 00:54.358
into the warehouse floor.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.230
- What did it say?
- It says "Roy."

00:56.317 --> 00:58.362
Your buddy, Red John.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.277
- He killed your sister.
- That's not true.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.540
- You don't want it to be true--
- Just stop!

01:02.627 --> 01:05.239
God, you're just like him,
wonder why the you two

01:05.326 --> 01:07.502
didn't become lifelong friends
the moment you shook hands.

01:07.589 --> 01:08.851
I'm never gonna convince you

01:08.938 --> 01:10.635
that Red John
killed your sister.

01:10.722 --> 01:13.899
You need to go and find out
the truth for yourself.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.598
You know where to find me.

01:16.685 --> 01:19.079

01:49.761 --> 01:50.806

01:53.243 --> 01:54.636
- Hey.
- Ah!

01:54.723 --> 01:57.160
[crashing]

01:57.247 --> 01:58.509
[grunting]

02:03.340 --> 02:04.341
Ah!

02:06.256 --> 02:08.084
[panting]

02:15.004 --> 02:16.179
Wake up.

02:17.659 --> 02:18.921
[whimpering]

02:21.010 --> 02:22.316
[crying]

02:26.755 --> 02:30.628
Hello, Julia.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.109
[crying]
What do you want?

02:33.196 --> 02:35.111
You know exactly what I want.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.946
[Julia screaming]

02:44.033 --> 02:46.427
[crying]

02:49.952 --> 02:52.172
You want me to stop?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.043
Then tell me what I wanna know.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.571
I told you.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.443
I don't know anything.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.188
[crying continues]

03:11.191 --> 03:13.932
You don't know anything, huh?

03:14.019 --> 03:17.458
[crying]
I don't know.
I didn't know your sister.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.203
Sure about that?

03:23.290 --> 03:27.032
I don't,
I don't know anything.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.512
Aah!

03:31.646 --> 03:33.343
Yousureyou don't know?

03:33.430 --> 03:35.693
[sobbing]

03:35.780 --> 03:37.217
Okay!

03:37.304 --> 03:40.611
[sobbing]
I'll talk, please,
just..

03:40.698 --> 03:41.830
...stop.

03:49.054 --> 03:52.667
I wasn't involved
with your sister's death.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.059
[Julia sobbing]

04:00.109 --> 04:03.808
This Lorelei Martins, she broke
into the home last night.

04:03.895 --> 04:07.203
She assaulted the victim,
cuffed her hands and feet

04:07.290 --> 04:09.379
and tortured her
for well over an hour.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.815
Does this have audio?

04:10.902 --> 04:12.382
Unfortunately, no.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.949
We don't know
what they're discussing.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.038
How did you get this on tape?

04:16.125 --> 04:19.084
[male #1]
'We found a nanny cam
hidden in the living room.'

04:19.171 --> 04:21.609
'A neighbor said the victim
had it because she suspected'

04:21.696 --> 04:24.046
'the housekeeper was stealing.'

04:24.133 --> 04:26.527
Well, we appreciate Sac PD
bringing us the case.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.445
[instrumental music]

04:38.930 --> 04:41.281
[theme music]

04:57.601 --> 04:58.559
Hey, boss.

04:58.646 --> 04:59.864
Victim's name
is Julia Howard.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.823
38, single, lives alone.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.608
She manages a battered women's
shelter here in Sacramento.

05:04.695 --> 05:07.437
[Lisbon]
'Doesn't seem like the kind of
person Lorelei would target.'

05:07.524 --> 05:10.179
No, she doesn't.
Family, friends, co-workers.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.963
'They all say
Julia was a saint.'

05:12.050 --> 05:14.139
'Dedicated her life
to helping others.'

05:14.226 --> 05:16.490
So why did Lorelei kill her?

05:16.577 --> 05:17.708
Any thoughts?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.408
- Jane?
- Uh..

05:21.495 --> 05:23.105
No, no thoughts.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.150
Okay, you and Rigsby
need to look into

05:25.237 --> 05:26.587
every aspect of Lorelei's life.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.676
Her mother. Her sister, Miranda.
Even Red John.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.418
We need to find the connection
between Lorelei and our victim.

05:31.505 --> 05:32.636
[Cho]
'You got it.'

05:36.466 --> 05:38.555
- No thoughts?
- No.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.036
[phone ringing]

05:42.820 --> 05:45.170
This is Lisbon.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.564
Yes, sir.
I-I'll be right there.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.740
It's Bertram. I gotta go.

05:49.827 --> 05:50.915
Okay.

05:52.613 --> 05:53.701
You comin'?

05:55.572 --> 05:56.965
No. Sorry.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.017
[knocking on door]

06:06.104 --> 06:07.192
Am I interrupting?

06:07.279 --> 06:09.369
Oh, no, no. Come on in.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.415
Teresa, you remember Bob
Kirkland from Homeland Security?

06:12.502 --> 06:14.243
- Of course.
- Agent Lisbon.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.114
Uh, Bob and his team

06:16.201 --> 06:18.639
were interested to hear about
the return of Lorelei Martins.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.336
Can imagine.

06:20.423 --> 06:23.513
Her arrest continues to be
a priority for Homeland.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.863
I've heard you say that
in the past but..

06:25.950 --> 06:27.474
...you never said why.

06:27.561 --> 06:30.215
Lorelei Martins is a known
associate of Red John.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.869
'She escaped from prison.'

06:31.956 --> 06:33.828
She kidnapped your colleague,
Patrick Jane.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.874
Which are all valid reasons
for the CBI to be involved

06:36.961 --> 06:38.310
but Homeland?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.008
Uh, you deal with terrorists.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.664
We have a wide range
of investigative interests.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.101
- I have to learn that trick.
- Which?

06:46.188 --> 06:48.669
How you speak
without saying anything.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.801
Well, I'll try to be
more direct.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.021
Director Bertram has been
kind enough to offer

06:53.108 --> 06:55.806
CBI's resources
in finding Lorelei Martins.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.373
Sir?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.419
Well, you and Homeland
won't be working together

06:59.506 --> 07:02.030
directly but Kirkland
and his team will have

07:02.117 --> 07:05.860
full access
to your investigation.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.905
We'd like to be kept
in the loop.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.357
Bertram is bringing Homeland
in on the Lorelei murder.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.102
Did you hear me?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.584
Yes.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.806
Now that
she's killed someone

07:38.893 --> 07:41.069
they're gonna start looking
again into her escape.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.463
- That's likely.
- Jane.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.814
I know you broke her out
of prison, and you know I know.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.947
- And I know you know I know.
- This is not funny.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.993
If they find out,
you could be charged

07:52.080 --> 07:53.516
as an accomplice to murder.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.344
Ifthey find out,
a-and they won't

07:55.431 --> 07:57.389
unless, of course,
you sing to the coppers.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.567
Which I won't and that makes me
an accomplice to murder too.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.830
If you look at it
like a persnickety lawyer.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.527
- She tortured someone.
- Yeah.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.616
It's, t's horrible.
I-I know.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.662
But she must have had
a good reason.

08:08.749 --> 08:11.316
- God, can you hear yourself?
- Yes, I hear myself.

08:11.403 --> 08:15.451
Julia Howard must have helped
murder Lorelei's sister.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.235
Must have been there
with Red John.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.890
Lorelei wouldn't do this
otherwise. I trust her.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.724
Jane, I am your partner,
not her.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.161
You need to be honest
with me.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.467
I know.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.732
If she contacts you

08:35.819 --> 08:37.734
if you find anything out
about her

08:37.821 --> 08:40.215
if you have any insights
into the case..

08:40.302 --> 08:41.608
I will tell you.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.792
The tally needs to be filled
out once every morning

08:51.879 --> 08:53.228
and once every evening.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.056
- Okay, no problem.
- Thank you, Karen.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.320
- Hello, can I help you?
- I guess.

08:58.407 --> 09:01.584
I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.
This is Patrick Jane.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.369
Kevin Rome. I'm one of the
trustees here at the shelter.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.980
Is there someplace
we could talk?

09:06.067 --> 09:08.678
We wanted to ask you some
questions about Julia Howard.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.159
Of course, the rest of the
trustees are right outside.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.946
Jane, are you comin'?

09:16.033 --> 09:18.775
Uh, no, I thought I'd just
take a look around if..

09:18.862 --> 09:20.037
...that's alright.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.778
- Of course.
- Thank you.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.568
Julia was a wonderful woman.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.571
So giving, so selfless.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.398
I can't think
of anyone who had

09:33.485 --> 09:35.575
a negative thing
to say about her.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.664
How long did Julia work
at the shelter?

09:37.751 --> 09:39.491
Eight years, but, uh..

09:39.579 --> 09:42.016
I mean, she did
so much more than that, she..

09:42.103 --> 09:43.583
...practically ran the place
single-handedly.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.237
That's why we're all here,
to try and fill in

09:46.324 --> 09:48.544
as best we can
until we find a replacement.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.155
None of you actually worked
at the shelter.

09:51.242 --> 09:54.245
No, we serve an advisory role
and help with fund-raising.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.421
But we volunteer when we can.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.511
Did you ever hear Julia mention
the name Lorelei Martins?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.514
- No.
- No. Is she a suspect?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.691
Uh, we're working
several different angles.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.171
[indistinct chattering]

10:25.276 --> 10:29.019
I saw on the website that
there was a fourth trustee.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.979
Steven Doppler. He's flying
up from LA tomorrow.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.458
We're, uh, meeting
with candidates

10:33.545 --> 10:35.678
- to fill Julia's position.
- So soon?

10:35.765 --> 10:37.201
[Jason]
'The meeting
was already scheduled.'

10:37.288 --> 10:38.899
'It's our monthly meeting.'

10:38.986 --> 10:42.163
I-I know it seems cold,
replacing her so quickly but

10:42.250 --> 10:45.079
the women at the shelter here,
they've-they've suffered enough.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.429
Their safety and security,
that comes first.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.126
Julia would have wanted that.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.607
[instrumental music]

11:18.634 --> 11:21.028
[music continues]

11:49.926 --> 11:52.320
[music continues]

12:03.026 --> 12:05.115
How can we get in touch
with Doppler?

12:05.202 --> 12:08.205
He'll be with us all day
tomorrow at the Fairchild Hotel.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.338
That's where we're meeting
to interview new candidates.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.774
Did Julia live in Sacramento?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.558
Jane, I'm in the middle
of questioning.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.039
Yeah, it won't take long.
D-did she?

12:16.126 --> 12:18.128
- Yes.
- And you're certain?

12:18.215 --> 12:19.303
Yes.

12:19.390 --> 12:22.045
She lived here for?

12:22.132 --> 12:24.961
For as long as I've known her.
Eight years, at least.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.965
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.840
Lisbon, I'm gonna head on.

12:37.669 --> 12:42.022
Your colleague,
he's, uh, very...odd.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.763
Yes. Yeah.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.290
[dramatic music]

13:16.926 --> 13:19.320
[music continues]

13:46.956 --> 13:49.350
[music continues]

14:12.764 --> 14:14.027
[door closing]

14:30.521 --> 14:31.740
Lorelei.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.094
Did you miss me?

14:44.579 --> 14:46.146
You murdered someone.

14:46.233 --> 14:49.453
What did you think I was gonna
do when you set me free?

14:49.540 --> 14:53.501
- You tortured them.
- I knew you'd be upset.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.243
You're not as tough-minded
as you'd like to think you are.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.117
So I wanted to see you.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.990
I haven't gone off the rails,
I promise.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.469
I know what I'm doing.

15:07.776 --> 15:12.041
Julia Howard got exactly
what she deserved.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.652
- She helped kill my sister.
- Helped who?

15:14.739 --> 15:16.437
Not Red John.
She didn't know him.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.482
But I know
who to go to next.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.181
Well, whoever that is,
they work with Red John.

15:21.268 --> 15:24.314
Maybe. Maybe not.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.359
I'm gonna find out.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.577
Someone from the shelter?

15:28.449 --> 15:31.017
I have to go, Patrick.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.758
You're foolish
doing this on your own.

15:33.845 --> 15:37.240
- Let me help you.
- No.

15:37.327 --> 15:40.243
I've done terrible things.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.376
Unforgivable things.
There's no way back.

15:44.726 --> 15:47.120
You and me are
on different roads, I hope.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.953
[whispering]
Wish me luck.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.704
[knocking]

16:06.791 --> 16:08.619
Doing some background
on Julia Howard

16:08.706 --> 16:10.230
and I think
I found something.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.623
She owned a home
in Sacramento since eight years.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.931
But she also leased a house
in Davis at 1309, Orchid Lane.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.499
I don't understand. W-was she
renting it for somebody else?

16:18.586 --> 16:20.631
Unlikely. She doesn't have
any family in California.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.243
- Did she even have the money?
- Not on her salary.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.770
[instrumental music]

16:28.857 --> 16:30.424
- Where's Jane?
- 'Huh.'

16:30.511 --> 16:31.816
- Haven't seen him.
- Thanks.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.035
Okay.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.651
[instrumental music]

16:50.096 --> 16:51.227
[keys jingling]

16:54.970 --> 16:56.058
Evening.

17:02.717 --> 17:05.372
We had an agreement.
No more lies.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.200
And I haven't.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.333
You didn't tell me
you were coming here.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.769
Was Lorelei here?

17:11.856 --> 17:13.510
- Yes.
- Damn it, Jane.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.252
I didn't know she would be.
I was following a lead.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.862
Which you didn't tell me
about.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.648
You know I tell you
about 30% of what I do.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.215
That doesn't mean
that I'm lying.

17:22.302 --> 17:25.740
Anyway, Lorelei confirmed
that I was right.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.394
Julia was involved
in Miranda's death.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.223
Oh, you'll have to forgive me
if I don't believe her.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.094
Miranda must have stayed
at Julia's shelter.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.661
I'll check it out.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.229
- Where's Lorelei now?
- Uh, she's gone.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.622
- She left.
- What do you mean, she left?

17:38.709 --> 17:41.669
- Did you try and stop her?
- Even if I could, I wouldn't.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.367
She's trying to figure out
if Red John killed Miranda.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.195
I need to let her do that.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.068
You think when Lorelei finds
out, she'll tell you his name?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.765
That's the hope.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.724
You're putting your trust in
the mistress of a serial killer.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.204
She's playing you.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.728
- Playing me? How?
- Look, you're blind.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.774
You're involved with her.
It's clouding your judgment--

17:59.861 --> 18:02.646
There's no involvement.
I feel nothing for her.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.822
Now you're really lying.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.050
I'm gonna make this
very simple.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.358
I will not be a part of this
anymore and neither will you

18:18.445 --> 18:20.142
if you wanna remain
with the team.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.797
An ultimatum?

18:22.884 --> 18:25.016
Someone's playing
a little too much poker.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.068
I confess.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.289
I-I may have some feelings

18:36.376 --> 18:38.987
but if I have crossed
any lines

18:39.074 --> 18:41.120
it is not
because I like her.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.905
I will do anything I can
to get to Red John

18:43.992 --> 18:46.037
but you have known that
since the start.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.694
[phone ringing]

18:54.872 --> 18:56.047
Director Bertram.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.663
I will be there
in the morning, sir.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.970
- Does he want an update?
- Yes.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.581
What are you gonna tell him?

19:07.668 --> 19:09.887
I don't know.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.933
You do realize that
if Bertram and Kirkland

19:12.020 --> 19:13.804
get to Lorelei before us,
then..

19:16.155 --> 19:17.678
...I'll never see her again.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.248
She won't tell me
who Red John is.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.380
I don't know what
to tell you, Jane.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.435
[Bertram]
'No, it's fine.
No, whatever you think.'

19:35.522 --> 19:37.001
No, no. I'm sorry.
That's fine.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.569
Thank you.
No, thank you, ma'am.

19:39.656 --> 19:40.918
Alright.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.795
Well, where are we?

19:47.882 --> 19:49.188
Uh, we've made some progress.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.845
Unfortunately,
th-there's nothing substantial.

19:54.932 --> 19:57.326
Now I don't wanna bore you
with the details.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.936
I see.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.374
What about Jane?
Does he have any insights?

20:01.461 --> 20:03.680
You know Jane.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.553
- He's got theories.
- I love a good theory.

20:06.640 --> 20:11.035
If any of them were good,
I'd share 'em with you.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.386
You know, Lisbon,
I've always respected you

20:13.473 --> 20:17.128
which is why I'm going to be
completely forthcoming.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.913
Please.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.437
I don't think Jane can be
trusted with Lorelei Martins.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.352
I don't know
if that's true.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.225
Well, he's admitted to his
sexual relationship with her.

20:26.312 --> 20:30.098
Then Martins kidnaps him and
they spend days alone together.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.883
I mean don't you ever wonder
what went on between them?

20:35.059 --> 20:40.978
Oh! I-if there's something going
on, you, you can talk to me.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.198
Thank you.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.852
I'll keep that in mind.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.464
If that's all..

20:51.032 --> 20:52.033
Great.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.000
What do you think?

21:08.092 --> 21:10.007
[sighing]

21:10.094 --> 21:13.707
You work with her.
You'd know better.

21:13.794 --> 21:16.318
Clearly, she knows more
than she's saying.

21:18.581 --> 21:21.192
But good detectives always
keep their cards close.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.545
But can we trust her?

21:25.632 --> 21:26.850
[sighing]

21:29.157 --> 21:30.376
Can we trust anyone?

21:34.205 --> 21:35.511
Morning, boss.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.905
Whatever you're doing, stop.
We have a lead.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.602
Julia Howard
may have been involved.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.648
- In Miranda Roman's death.
- What do we have?

21:41.735 --> 21:43.737
It looks like Miranda stayed
at Julia's shelter.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.521
Find out what
was going on there.

21:45.608 --> 21:46.783
Sure, boss. Yeah.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.322
What?

22:03.409 --> 22:05.933
Thanks for, uh,
not telling Bertram.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.544
I don't wanna be thanked.

22:08.631 --> 22:09.632
Too late.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.814
[dramatic music]

22:33.047 --> 22:34.440
[car engine whirring]

22:46.452 --> 22:49.324
Hey, boss. Just got back
from the women's shelter.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.021
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.849
This is their official
intake log.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.895
No evidence of Miranda Roman
ever staying there.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.940
- Well, that's strange.
- Here's what's stranger.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.986
The detective who investigated
Miranda's murder is positive

22:59.073 --> 23:01.771
that she stayed at the shelter.
She had an abusive ex-boyfriend.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.861
And stayed there five years ago.
About a week before her death.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.647
Alright, talk to everybody who
was on staff around that time

23:07.734 --> 23:09.213
and dig deeper
into their records.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.259
- Figure out what we're missing.
- I'm on it.

23:20.921 --> 23:23.314
[dramatic music]

23:31.061 --> 23:34.978
[indistinct chattering]

23:35.065 --> 23:36.240
Hey, hey, hey.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.462
He's got my ball, mum.

23:40.549 --> 23:41.985
- Come on.
- 'Give it.'

23:43.813 --> 23:45.728
She's got a gun!

23:45.815 --> 23:47.861
'Look! She has a gun!'

23:47.948 --> 23:48.949
Run!

23:49.036 --> 23:50.777
[all screaming]

23:54.389 --> 23:55.695
Hey!

23:55.782 --> 23:58.132
Hey, hey!
Stop or I'll shoot!

23:58.219 --> 23:59.438
'Get down on your knees.'

24:05.139 --> 24:06.445
Get rid of the gun!

24:09.360 --> 24:10.449
[gunshot]

24:12.668 --> 24:15.062
[gunshots]

24:21.285 --> 24:22.243
Ah!

24:24.550 --> 24:26.334
[gunshots]

24:26.421 --> 24:27.509
[crashing]

24:27.596 --> 24:28.597
Ah!

24:30.512 --> 24:31.948
[panting]

24:37.954 --> 24:40.348
[gunshots]

24:49.488 --> 24:51.664
[indistinct chattering]

24:56.843 --> 24:58.322
- CBI?
- What happened?

24:58.409 --> 25:00.847
We got report of a gunman
that matches the description

25:00.934 --> 25:02.413
of your homicide suspect,
Lorelei Martins.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.198
- Was anyone killed?
- No, security guard's injured.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.243
But it looks like
he's gonna be okay.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.028
- Where is she now?
- Not clear.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.683
She escaped on foot.
My men are searching the area.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.859
We did find something
in the suspect's vehicle.

25:12.946 --> 25:16.036
A pair of handcuffs,
pliers and a stun gun.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.646
She's planning
to abduct someone.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.649
Huh.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.175
[Melissa]
'Uh, we were standing
outside a hotel'

25:25.262 --> 25:27.874
'when we heard
someone screaming.'

25:27.961 --> 25:30.746
And that's when I saw her
standing there.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.095
She had a gun.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.575
She could have killed me.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.230
We don't believe
that was her intention.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.754
You don'tbelieve?

25:38.841 --> 25:39.842
That's reassuring.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.846
Can you tell me
what shedidwant?

25:43.933 --> 25:46.327
It appears she was planning
to abduct one of you.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.634
Good lord. Why?

25:48.721 --> 25:50.200
Why the trustees?

25:50.287 --> 25:53.116
You think she thinks one of them
killed her sister?

25:53.203 --> 25:54.944
Well, it looks that way.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.207
Probably thinks they were helped
by Julia Howard.

25:57.294 --> 26:00.559
Huh! She's kinda doing
our job for us in a way.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.561
Shame we can't give her
a call.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.433
Yes, it is.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.870
Any ideas which trustee?

26:07.957 --> 26:09.089
Nope.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.357
- Did you know Miranda Roman?
- No. Why?

26:16.444 --> 26:18.185
We believe she stayed
at the shelter.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.840
Um, I wouldn't know about that.
I don't have anything

26:20.927 --> 26:22.319
to do with the day-to-day
operations.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.583
Who did other than Julia?

26:24.670 --> 26:26.846
I'm not exactly sure
what you're looking for.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.762
Basically, anything we can use
to determine whether or not

26:29.849 --> 26:31.241
someone stayed
at the shelter.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.026
Well, you have
the official intake log.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.636
- Right?
- Right.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.030
Other than the daily tally,
that's all there is.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.380
Wait, what daily tally?

26:39.467 --> 26:42.601
I don't know, I told you..

26:42.688 --> 26:44.864
...I was involved
in fund-raising.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.953
Parties, galas,
that sort of thing.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.042
At the hotel,
which of the trustees

26:49.129 --> 26:51.218
did the gunman seem to target?

26:51.305 --> 26:52.523
I couldn't tell you.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.916
Pick someone.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.875
First name
that comes to mind.

26:55.962 --> 26:56.919
I don't know.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.486
I don't know.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.618
I don't know.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.839
Hey, we got something.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.407
So I looked into the shelter,
and found something strange.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.974
This is the shelter's
official record.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.279
Miranda's name's missing.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.107
- Oh, that much we already know.
- Right.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.936
But the shelter also keeps
a daily tally for state records.

27:14.023 --> 27:17.070
Doesn't list names, just tracks
the number of women staying.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.114
'Here's what's weird.'

27:18.201 --> 27:19.594
'During Miranda's stay'

27:19.681 --> 27:21.509
there's a discrepancy
between the two records.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.598
'In the tally, there's a woman
unaccounted for.'

27:23.685 --> 27:26.035
Well, it means someone
was doctoring the books.

27:26.122 --> 27:28.951
Yeah, someone was trying to
erase evidence of Miranda Roman.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.041
Not someone, Julia Howard.
And there's more.

27:32.128 --> 27:34.130
Yeah, this isn't the first time
it happened.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.524
I've found five instances
of women unaccounted for.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.744
It's a pattern.
I-it's what it's all about.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.310
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.573
I'll release the trustees
but I'll have an agent

27:42.661 --> 27:44.140
sit on each of their homes.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.576
Rigsby, you take Jason Lennon.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.317
Cho, you take Kevin Rome.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.580
I'll have Karl sit
on Stephen Doppler's hotel.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.234
I'll take Melissa Enfield.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.280
We'll be in radio contact
the entire time.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.325
If Lorelei goes after
one of them--

27:55.412 --> 27:57.588
- She will.
- We'll be there to stop her.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.115
- You're not coming.
- Yes, I am.

28:02.202 --> 28:06.162
Jane, listen, I know you wanna
be a part but I need you to--

28:06.249 --> 28:08.817
- Well, there's no reason.
- There is a reason.

28:08.904 --> 28:11.472
If things go wrong,
you need to be far away.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.908
You're in too deep.

28:15.432 --> 28:18.305
Jane, I'm asking you.
Please stay here.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.585
[dramatic music]

29:05.221 --> 29:07.615
[music continues]

29:32.161 --> 29:34.773
[whispering]
Hey, Cho. You there?

29:34.860 --> 29:37.079
Yeah. What's up?

29:37.166 --> 29:38.298
What's goin' on?

29:40.169 --> 29:41.562
Did you need somethin'?

29:41.649 --> 29:43.433
Yeah, uh, well..

29:43.520 --> 29:46.785
Hey, what do you think
Van Pelt's up to right now?

29:46.872 --> 29:48.438
It's 5 a.m.
She's sleeping.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.051
You know what I mean.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.792
Well, she's at a computer
training program.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.185
She's probably using computers.

29:56.272 --> 29:59.014
I should have signed up
for that.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.277
You barely know
how to turn a computer on.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.584
What do you think
they teach you there? Duh!

30:06.761 --> 30:09.155
[dramatic music]

30:32.352 --> 30:33.701
[phone ringing]

30:35.094 --> 30:37.270
[sighs]
Hey, Jane, what's up?

30:37.357 --> 30:40.882
Rigsby, listen to me.
Lorelei is going after Lennon.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.015
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.712
- It's the fishing line.
- The what?

30:44.799 --> 30:46.453
'Well, I'll explain later.'

30:46.540 --> 30:47.802
[crashing]

30:51.719 --> 30:53.112
'Rigsby?'

30:53.199 --> 30:54.809
Are you there?

30:54.896 --> 30:57.290
[dramatic music]

31:16.178 --> 31:18.050
You there?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.181
Rigsby?

31:26.667 --> 31:27.886
'Rigsby?'

31:34.805 --> 31:36.633
[phone ringing]

31:38.331 --> 31:39.593
- Hey, Jane.
- Yeah.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.074
Lorelei is at
Jason Lennon's house.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.903
I think Rigsby's hurt.
We need to hurry.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.121
I'm on my way.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.691
Cho, Karl, get to
Rigsby's location now.

31:50.778 --> 31:51.735
I'm calling for backup.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.912
[glass shattering]

32:16.021 --> 32:18.414
[metal clanging]

32:23.724 --> 32:24.681
[gasping]

32:24.768 --> 32:26.379
[gunshot]

32:26.466 --> 32:29.121
[grunting]

32:29.208 --> 32:30.905
Oh, oh!

32:30.992 --> 32:33.168
[Jason sobbing]
Please.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.388
Please.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.172
Don't hurt me.

32:37.259 --> 32:38.695
I don't wanna hurt you.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.176
[gasping]

32:43.700 --> 32:45.006
I just wanna talk.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.708
[intense music]

33:03.590 --> 33:05.592
[knocking]

33:05.679 --> 33:06.810
'Rigsby?'

33:06.897 --> 33:08.421
- Rigsby?
- Mmm..

33:08.508 --> 33:09.813
You alright?

33:09.900 --> 33:11.119
You're okay.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.298
[screaming]

33:19.301 --> 33:21.912
[crying]

33:22.000 --> 33:23.697
I don't know.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.047
[screaming]

33:26.134 --> 33:27.396
[panting]

33:29.007 --> 33:30.399
Patrick.

33:30.486 --> 33:31.531
Thank God.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.974
I told you I need
to do this on my own.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.194
No, you need my help now.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.457
'Police will be here very soon.'

33:44.544 --> 33:46.459
Do they know I'm here?

33:46.546 --> 33:48.678
[Jane]
'No, not yet,
but they soon will.'

33:50.593 --> 33:52.378
[Jason]
'Wh-what the hell's going on?'

33:58.906 --> 34:00.908
Lorelei thinks this is
just about her sister

34:00.995 --> 34:03.693
but we both know better,
don't we?

34:03.780 --> 34:05.434
What are you talking about?

34:05.521 --> 34:06.653
Huh?

34:08.698 --> 34:12.050
You remember those other
five women from the shelter?

34:12.137 --> 34:13.964
The ones Julia helped you with?

34:15.923 --> 34:17.925
Julia.

34:18.012 --> 34:20.232
Your partner.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.972
She found the most
vulnerable women

34:22.060 --> 34:24.497
and she brought them
to you at her house.

34:24.584 --> 34:27.369
This is crazy.
I'm a good person.

34:27.456 --> 34:28.936
Okay.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.546
So you didn't rape 'em?

34:30.633 --> 34:31.808
No!

34:31.895 --> 34:33.071
You didn't murder 'em?

34:36.596 --> 34:40.426
You didn't bind their hands
and feet with fishing line?

34:40.513 --> 34:41.470
[sobbing]
No.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.562
So I guess this isn't
familiar to you.

34:46.649 --> 34:49.435
[panting]

34:49.522 --> 34:50.697
No.

34:54.396 --> 34:55.615
Jason, look at me.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.965
Look at me.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.140
I'm the law.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.362
I've to take you in.
I can't hurt you.

35:03.449 --> 35:04.667
I-I can't kill you.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.193
But she can.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.066
If you don't tell me
the truth right now,

35:12.153 --> 35:14.895
I'm gonna walk out of here
and leave you two alone.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.897
No. Please.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.160
Alright, now you see
it's useless lying to me.

35:19.247 --> 35:20.596
Tell me the truth.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.607
[chuckling]

35:35.829 --> 35:40.703
I...work...for...Red John.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.708
Yeah.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.971
[Jason]
'He wanted Miranda
for some reason.'

35:48.058 --> 35:49.190
'I don't know why.'

35:51.149 --> 35:53.934
He knew her boyfriend
was abusing her.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.199
And she was vulnerable.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.593
He told me..

36:00.680 --> 36:03.117
...to send Julia
to counsel her.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.860
'To persuade her to come
to the shelter.'

36:06.947 --> 36:10.080
Julia brought Miranda to me

36:10.168 --> 36:12.996
and I brought her to Red John.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.439
And what did Red John do to her?

36:20.526 --> 36:23.920
[laughing]
You know what he did.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.705
She needs to hear it.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.234
Red John..

36:33.321 --> 36:35.497
...killed Miranda.

36:39.284 --> 36:40.589
I'm sorry.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.511
Thank you, Patrick.

37:05.484 --> 37:06.659
[sighing]

37:07.703 --> 37:09.096
Tell me.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.403
Tell you what?

37:11.490 --> 37:12.926
Red John's name.

37:13.013 --> 37:14.362
Ask him.

37:14.449 --> 37:15.929
I need a head start.
Sorry.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.496
W-wait, we had an agreement.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.019
He'll talk. He's weak.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.499
We had an agreement.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.544
Well, I'm breaking it.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.851
I've done far worse.

37:24.938 --> 37:27.027
You're just gonna go
kill Red John?

37:27.114 --> 37:29.421
You don't think he knows
what you've been doing?

37:29.508 --> 37:31.640
He's got weaknesses.
He can die.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.599
And I'm gonna kill him.

37:33.686 --> 37:34.991
It was good knowing you.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.353
[gunshot]

37:53.793 --> 37:55.011
Sorry.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.018
[siren wailing]

38:07.285 --> 38:08.895
[grunting]

38:08.982 --> 38:10.853
- You alright?
- Not really.

38:13.247 --> 38:14.944
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.947
An ambulance is on its way.
You stay with him.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.601
[tires screeching]

38:22.430 --> 38:23.953
[heavy breathing]

38:25.607 --> 38:27.435
Jane.

38:27.522 --> 38:28.741
What happened?

38:28.828 --> 38:30.351
Lorelei shot him.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.310
He had a pulse
but it's gone.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.312
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.836
- Jane, let me take over.
- No, no, I got it.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.142
I got it.
He knows who Red John is.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.623
[siren wailing]

38:53.679 --> 38:57.335
He had a pulse but I can't,
I can't find it anymore.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.337
[indistinct]

39:09.172 --> 39:10.913
Rigsby's on the way
to the hospital.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.699
We need to find Lorelei. Let's
have CHP set up roadblocks.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.962
- She can't be far from here.
- You got it.

39:16.049 --> 39:17.877
What are you doing here?

39:17.964 --> 39:20.183
This crime scene
is now under the jurisdiction

39:20.270 --> 39:23.535
of Homeland Security.
Have your agents stand down.

39:23.622 --> 39:26.538
- Jane...stop.
- Get him out of there.

39:26.625 --> 39:27.887
You get away from me.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.846
Step away from me.
No. Stop. Stop it! Let go.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.022
- Get out of the ambulance.
- No!

39:33.109 --> 39:35.068
- Jason Lennon's now my witness.
- No!

39:35.155 --> 39:36.678
- Jane, let it go.
- Let's go.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.593
- No!
- 'Jane.'

39:38.680 --> 39:41.074
[siren wailing]

39:43.903 --> 39:45.513
That's enough. Come on.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.142
[knock on door]

40:14.586 --> 40:15.761
Any word on Lennon?

40:15.848 --> 40:17.806
The doctors are keeping him
in a coma.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.591
They can't risk
taking him out yet.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.157
You can't get
the case back.

40:21.244 --> 40:22.942
It's only been two weeks.
I'm trying.

40:26.989 --> 40:28.469
Isn't why you're here,
is it?

40:32.952 --> 40:34.301
Okay. Let's go.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.395
[indistinct chattering]

40:44.311 --> 40:46.705
[dramatic music]

41:14.341 --> 41:16.735
[music continues]

41:45.894 --> 41:47.243
I'm sorry.

41:53.206 --> 41:54.555
She had it coming.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.600
[theme music]
