[music playing]

00:08.342 --> 00:09.510
I'll see you guys later.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.978
I'm going out with Sharon.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.980
Well why don't you bring her
in so she can meet the folks?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.115
Yeah.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.549
You've been dating her
for like three months.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.884
We've never even met her.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.819
Nothing personal, Roseanne
I just haven't introduced

00:18.852 --> 00:20.554
Sharon to any of my friends.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.191
Oh, you mean any of your
straight friends, right?

00:23.224 --> 00:24.758
Because you've never
been able to accept

00:24.792 --> 00:27.561
our alternate lifestyle.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.930
Well, it isn't a
choice, you know.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.165
It's not that.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.066
Well, what?

00:32.100 --> 00:32.966
Are you ashamed of her?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.335
Is she a dog or something?

00:37.305 --> 00:38.172
Hey babe.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.273
You ready?

00:39.307 --> 00:41.109
Um, Nancy how come
when you date guys,

00:41.142 --> 00:43.344
they look like Arnie,
and when you date girls,

00:43.377 --> 00:46.013
they look like her?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.615
Jackie, Roseanne,
this is Sharon.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.284
She's an erotic dancer
performance artist.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.652
I'm a stripper.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.920
Hi.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.888
I wanted to meet
you for a while.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.391
But for some reason Nancy
was scared to introduce

00:57.425 --> 00:58.992
her girlfriend to you guys.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.494
Why, you ain't one of
them lesbians, are you?

01:03.864 --> 01:05.866
Can we go already?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.336
Look, we're going dancing at
that new club in Elgin Friday

01:08.369 --> 01:09.237
night.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.772
You two should join us.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.675
Oh, I don't think that
would be a very good idea.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.177
Oh, come on.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.077
I think it would be fun.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.979
I haven't been dancing since--

01:19.012 --> 01:22.250
when was dad's funeral?

01:22.283 --> 01:24.618
I don't think you'd
have such a great time.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.653
Sounds like fun.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.956
It's a gay bar.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.125
Okie dokie.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.527
Well, Jackie, it doesn't
bother us if it's gay.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.462
Well it might.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.131
Friday is convert
a hetero night.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.232
What are you
afraid we're going

01:38.266 --> 01:40.234
to embarrass you or something?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.502
I know all the etiquette.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.604
It's knives and
forks on the left,

01:43.637 --> 01:46.340
and vibrators on the right.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.675
Oh, hi fellas.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.011
I got to go.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.413
I hope you guys come.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.314
Nice to meet you.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.549
Roseanne, I really have to go?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.685
Well, I'm not going to
feel comfortable there.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.953
What if everybody
there thinks I'm gay?

01:59.987 --> 02:03.957
Well then you could you think
they're gay right back at them.

02:03.991 --> 02:08.128
So, Friday night I'll get
my chance to see Roseanne

02:08.162 --> 02:09.930
out with my people, huh?

02:09.963 --> 02:13.267
That should prove
quite entertaining.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.368
Why?

02:14.402 --> 02:15.936
Well, hmm.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.306
How can I put this delicately?

02:18.339 --> 02:22.276
A gay bar is sort of
like a size 12 dress.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.644
You just won't fit in.

02:28.716 --> 02:32.085
[music playing]

03:16.930 --> 03:18.699
David, did you
finish my laundry?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, it's in your bag.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.835
You know, now that I'm not
going to be there anymore,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.537
you're going to have to
learn how to do your own.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.138
How come?
Ma said you can visit.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.445
[man scoffing]

03:35.416 --> 03:37.318
What?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.386
You're pathetic, man.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.555
She orders you around,
you just take it.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.324
You got no guts.

03:43.357 --> 03:47.761
I've got guts,
I just hide them.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.962
Hey honey.
I'm home.

03:48.996 --> 03:49.863
Hey.

03:49.897 --> 03:50.831
Hi.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.835
I'll be down in a sec.

[man scoffs]

03:59.340 --> 04:01.108
What?

04:01.141 --> 04:03.110
I wouldn't let my wife
show off her body like that.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.245
It gives other guys ideas.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.747
I don't got to
worry about that.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.950
There's nothing those guys got
that she can't get at home.

04:09.983 --> 04:14.922
See David, I can
keep Becky satisfied.

04:14.955 --> 04:15.823
Hey.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.191
I keep Darlene satisfied.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.393
David, what's the
matter with you.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.794
I told you to use
fabric softener.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.435
[doorbell rings]

04:30.504 --> 04:31.405
Wow, Dean.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.774
Dean Bates, it's
been a long time.

04:33.807 --> 04:34.875
Yeah.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.478
Do I know you?

04:37.511 --> 04:41.582
No, but when I was a freshman,
you went out with Becky,

04:41.615 --> 04:42.716
didn't you?

04:42.750 --> 04:43.684
Yeah.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.585
Come on it.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.388
It's good you're here.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.422
Hey Mark.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.457
This is Dean Bates.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.292
Dean used to date
Becky, your wife.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.293
Oh, so you're her husband

04:53.327 --> 04:54.127
Yeah, that's right.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.199
So Dean, you still
playing football?

04:59.232 --> 05:01.101
Yeah, I got a scholarship
to Northwestern.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.002
Really?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.170
Great.

05:03.203 --> 05:06.106
Going in college and
playing football?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.107
Can't get that around here.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.679
Dean?

05:11.712 --> 05:12.946
Oh my god, how are you?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.616
Hey Becky.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.517
You look terrific.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.651
So do you.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.019
If you ask, me, that
guy's a lot better

05:19.052 --> 05:19.853
looking than you know.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.594
Why don't you go over there
and give him a big kiss.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.961
Hey Dean.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.796
I'm ready?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.034
Ready?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.736
Ready for what?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.905
I'm going to give
her a ride to school.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.973
But you two don't
even know each other?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.575
Yeah, we met at
some lame frat party.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.512
He was like the only guy there
not guzzling beer and saying

05:44.545 --> 05:46.714
god, I love you guys.

05:46.747 --> 05:47.815
I'll put your
stuff in the car.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.283
Oh, thanks.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.785
Hey Darlene.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.822
You hear Dean's got a
football scholarship?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.124
Darlene hates
football players.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.592
Things change.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.693
You're serious?

05:59.727 --> 06:02.262
He's giving you
a ride to school?

06:02.295 --> 06:03.631
So what, Becky,
what do you care?

06:03.664 --> 06:04.998
Well I don't think
she should be using

06:05.032 --> 06:07.401
my old boyfriends to get rides.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.769
So what, you're not
done riding him yet?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.144
Wait a minute.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.213
Did he just say
something clever?

06:20.247 --> 06:22.349
I cannot believe
you're doing that to me?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.717
So what's the
difference if your sister

06:23.751 --> 06:24.785
goes out with the guy?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.420
In case you've forgotten,
you're married.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.523
Oh, just leave me alone.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.860
Becky, get back here.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.294
Becky?

06:34.327 --> 06:35.195
Becky.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.163
Did you see that?

06:36.196 --> 06:37.765
Mark was going
crazy with jealousy.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.999
What an idiot.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.367
Yeah.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.935
Becky's not the one who's going
to have to think of some way

06:41.969 --> 06:45.238
to pay Dean back for the ride.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.173
See you, David.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.045
[music playing]

06:58.552 --> 07:00.253
Oh, now, just relax, Jackie.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.155
There's nothing to
be nervous about.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.624
No, what's to
be nervous about?

07:03.657 --> 07:06.393
Should be clear to anyone
that I'm traditional.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.529
Hey, look.

07:08.562 --> 07:12.533
There's another old
fashioned girl right there.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.502
My god!

07:14.535 --> 07:17.237
That pregnant woman is holding
hands with my mailman, woman.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.107
Lesbian.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.008
She waved at me.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.175
What do I do?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.210
Well, wave back?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.247
She's smiling at me.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.315
Well, yeah.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.683
That's because everybody
knows that waving

07:29.717 --> 07:33.153
at the International Gay Signal.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.054
Jackie.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.455
Jackie Harris!

07:35.489 --> 07:36.857
Oh, hi.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.191
Wow.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.394
So now I know why there's never
any mail for your husband.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.462
No, no.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.731
You don't understand.

07:43.764 --> 07:48.836
Oh, now you don't have
to hide our love, Pookie.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.803
Hi, I'm Roseanne.

07:49.837 --> 07:53.273
I'm the father.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.676
So, how long have
you two been together?

07:55.709 --> 07:56.710
Oh, what's it been now honey.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.847
About 38 years?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.983
Oh, and she's just
as feisty as ever.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.352
You know, I had a
feeling about you.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.621
You did?

08:07.655 --> 08:08.589
Why?

08:08.622 --> 08:11.291
What'd I do?

08:11.324 --> 08:15.696
You are so, so sick.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.932
Well if it isn't
Charlie Brown.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.134
Is that you, Roseanne?

08:21.168 --> 08:24.572
I thought it was a drag queen
doing a really bad Liz Taylor.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.410
Leon, come sit at a table with
us and act like we're together.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.679
I didn't come
here to be with you.

08:31.712 --> 08:36.116
I came here in search of
stimulating conversation.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.450
Oh, I smell Aramis.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.627
So gals, what will it be?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.762
Well, a beer for me and
a ginger ale for the little

08:49.763 --> 08:51.064

08:51.098 --> 08:53.133
It's nice to see some new
faces around here, especially

08:53.166 --> 08:54.735
pretty ones like yours.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.170
Oh, well thank you Marge.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.038
You're not too bad yourself.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.309
What are you doing?

09:02.342 --> 09:04.612
Doing what I do in any
bar, scoring free drinks.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.452
So, wow.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.487
Awesome tattoo there, Marge.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.388
Yeah?

Flirting.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.360
Hey Roseanne.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.129
Want to come boogie with us?

09:22.162 --> 09:23.797
Oh, she doesn't want to dance.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.133
I do, too.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.368
Can I, hon?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.604
I hate you.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.939
Keep an eye on her Marge.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.040
She's a big tease.

09:38.478 --> 09:39.813
We're sisters.

09:39.847 --> 09:40.648
Hey, aren't we all?

09:45.953 --> 09:50.290
You are one pretty lady.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.224
Care to dance?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.761
Oh, no thank you.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.262
Come on, what could it hurt?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.964
It could hurt you.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.565
You see that big butch
broad over there?

10:03.103 --> 10:03.904
I'm hers.

10:11.912 --> 10:15.248
[music playing]

10:19.787 --> 10:20.754
Let's take a break.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.223
OK.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.525
Woo.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.994
That was wild.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.495
Can you believe that
Nancy doesn't think

10:28.528 --> 10:30.530
I'm cool enough for this place?

10:30.563 --> 10:32.565
That must have been
before she saw you teaching

10:32.599 --> 10:35.168
40 people to do it the monkey.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.569
Yeah, how cool was that?

10:36.603 --> 10:39.239
Pretty damn cool.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.540
Where'd you learn
to dance like that?

10:40.573 --> 10:43.076
Well, actually I studied.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.444
Really, where?

10:44.477 --> 10:48.015
In my living room, with
the Solid Gold Dancers.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.183
You know, Roseanne, we
ought to hang out more often.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.284
I was thinking that, too.

10:51.318 --> 10:55.956
But next time let's
leave the wives at home.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.390
You read my mind.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.361
Huh?

11:18.311 --> 11:21.681
[music playing]

11:28.288 --> 11:29.990
What are you doing, cleaning?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.825
Yeah, well I tried
twitching my nose,

11:31.859 --> 11:33.026
but that didn't work so.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.929
I had to end up
doing it manually.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.064
Something the matter?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.598
You didn't say a word on
the way home last night.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.432
What's going on?

11:43.570 --> 11:46.306
That Sharon kissed me.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.440
Nancy's Sharon?

11:47.474 --> 11:50.377
No, Herb's Sharon
over on Elm Street.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.413
After I dropped you off I
went over there for a quickie.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.515
Exactly, what do you
mean by kissed you?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.851
I mean kissed me.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.520
Like full on the lips, you
know, like Dan used to.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.322
Before we were married.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.491
Oh my god, you were
kissed by a woman?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.160
No wonder you're upset.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.062
Well no, I'm not
upset about that.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.264
I'm just upset about
Nancy, you know.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.001
I mean, this could
devastate her?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.535
This is unbelievable.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.437
I just don't even know
how I'm going to tell her.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.472
You got kissed and all I got
was a couple of women asking

12:19.506 --> 12:20.774
if they could touch my stomach.

12:20.808 --> 12:21.674
Hi guys.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.144
Did you have fun last night?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.346
Why, what'd you hear?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.581
Well you left so early I
had to hitch a ride with Leon

12:28.615 --> 12:30.217
and some accountant
with pierced nipples.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.493
Hey.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.763
I have to tell you something,
and you're probably going

12:43.797 --> 12:45.265
to get really upset, you know.

12:45.298 --> 12:49.269
But I figure if I was you,
well I'd want to know.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.906
Last night, Sharon kissed me.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.507
I know, she told me.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.408
Oh, she did?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.376
Yeah.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.544
She just thought
you were real cute.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.212
And she wanted to
kiss you, so she did.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.415
Isn't she a riot?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.416
Oh.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.718
So you're not like
upset or anything?

13:05.752 --> 13:06.619
No, I think it's funny.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.855
Why, did it bother you?

13:07.888 --> 13:08.755
No.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.957
No, it didn't bother me.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.459
I mean, I pretty much knew
it was funny, you know.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.164
Oh my god.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.666
When Sharon told
me she kissed you,

13:19.699 --> 13:21.969
I told her there might be a
chance you might freak out.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.672
I'm not freaking out.
Why would I freak out?

13:25.705 --> 13:26.673
Well, you know, maybe--

13:26.706 --> 13:29.109
maybe you like the
kiss just a little.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.010
What?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.044
That is the most redic--

13:31.078 --> 13:31.879
what?

13:34.514 --> 13:35.582
Well it's not that unusual.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.784
I mean, sexuality isn't
all black and white.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.052
There's a whole gray area.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.289
I know about that gray area.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.357
And you're afraid that just
one little tiny percent of you

13:44.391 --> 13:46.093
might have been
turned on by a woman.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.232
That is the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

13:52.265 --> 13:56.203
I am not afraid of any small
percentage of my gayness

13:56.236 --> 13:58.471
inside, you know what I mean?

13:58.505 --> 14:05.578
I am totally OK about whether
I'm like 3%, or 4%, or lower.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.782
This is exactly why I
didn't want to invite you

14:09.816 --> 14:10.750
in the first place, Roseanne.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.053
Because you are a
total hypocrite.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.721
I am not a hypocrite.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.323
A hypocrite doesn't
go to a gay bar

14:16.356 --> 14:19.927
teach 40 gay people
how to do the monkey.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.962
Oh, and we're
supposed to admire you

14:21.995 --> 14:23.596
because you went to a gay bar?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.132
I'm supposed to think
you're cool because you

14:25.165 --> 14:26.934
have gay friends?

14:26.967 --> 14:29.836
I don't care if you think
I'm cool at all, because I

14:29.869 --> 14:32.039
know that I am cool, baby.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.441
I'm probably the coolest
chick you've ever met.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.376
And for your information,
I have friends

14:36.409 --> 14:37.744
that are way gayer than you.

14:40.813 --> 14:44.184
[music playing]

14:52.025 --> 14:52.892
Yes, son.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.594
Was there something you wanted?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.863
Yeah, mom said
she went dancing

14:56.896 --> 14:58.131
last night with other women.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.771
Yes.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.640
Isn't that wrong?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.643
No, son it's perfectly
fine, and anyone that tries

15:10.677 --> 15:12.679
to tell you different is wrong.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.982
Does that mean you
dance with other men?

15:21.021 --> 15:21.821
Yes I do.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.095
Really?

15:28.128 --> 15:28.996
No, never.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.131
Not once.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.634
- Well, I don't want to either.
- That's your choice.

15:37.804 --> 15:41.208
Hallelujah.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.144
[music playing]

15:48.581 --> 15:50.817
Cleaning again?

15:50.850 --> 15:52.285
Boy, if Sharon had
slipped you the tongue,

15:52.319 --> 15:55.388
we might actually get
this place up to code.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.558
No wonder women don't
find you attractive.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.161
Oh, is it so awful that
the kiss freaked you out?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.263
You're just not as cool
as you thought you were.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.597
Oh I'm not cool?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.299
You're the one sitting there
at the bar telling everybody

16:06.333 --> 16:09.069
you're from PBS doing research.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.270
Fine.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.571
If you don't have a
problem with what happened,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.606
why are you upset?

16:13.640 --> 16:14.774
Well, OK, Jackie.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.910
If you really have to know.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.647
Well, at first, you know, I--

16:20.680 --> 16:23.050
I thought that I
was upset for Nancy.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.818
And then I kind of realized
that that was just denial.

16:25.852 --> 16:30.490
And I'm really upset about Dan.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.392
Dan?

16:32.425 --> 16:33.893
Yeah.

16:33.926 --> 16:37.364
Because remember in 11th grade,
when that Jimmy MacWhorter

16:37.397 --> 16:39.166
kissed me, you know, and
Dan felt all threatened

16:39.199 --> 16:40.667
and everything and then
he went out after him

16:40.700 --> 16:42.001
and beat the crap out of him?

16:42.035 --> 16:43.236
Oh.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.572
So you're worried that Dan's
going to beat up Sharon?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.746
Yeah.

16:53.780 --> 16:57.750
Because Dan would feel
threatened by Sharon.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.651
Yeah.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.852
Yeah.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.655
Because you and Sharon
might-- woo-woo, woo-woo.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.657
Of course not.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.059
I am not gay.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.734
I didn't mean for that
to sound like it was bad

17:14.767 --> 17:16.069
or anything.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.904
You know, because if I was
gay, that would be just fine.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.272
But I'm not gay.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.641
So I just don't like people
calling me things that I'm not.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.576
Like A hypocrite.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.246
Or gay, you know,
because I'm not.

17:26.279 --> 17:30.617
I wouldn't like anybody
calling me like an astronaut,

17:30.650 --> 17:32.752
because it's fine
to be an astronaut.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.823
But see, I am not an astronaut.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.693
So I'm not going to admit
I was wrong or anything.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.295
But I just don't want to
fight with you anymore,

17:42.329 --> 17:44.964
so I was wrong.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.834
Thank you.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.337
I'm still pretty
cool, you know,

17:50.370 --> 17:54.374
for a 41-year-old mother of
three that lives in Lanford,

17:54.407 --> 17:57.043
Illinois.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.545
I like that Snoopy Dog Dog.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.453
I mean, it's not like you
have to be cool to be my friend,

18:06.486 --> 18:08.020
Roseanne.

18:08.054 --> 18:11.191
I mean, I'm not comfortable with
everything about you, either.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.692
Every time I think about
you and Dan in bed.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.526
Ew.

18:16.629 --> 18:20.700
Yeah, join the club.

18:20.733 --> 18:24.070
[music playing]

18:28.107 --> 18:30.543
Wow.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.180
That was, wow.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.314
I'd give you a
standing ovation,

18:34.347 --> 18:37.484
but I can't feel my legs.
What got into you?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.487
I don't know.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.023
You're just so manly.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.493
I'm just so turned on
by your masculinity.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.695
How'd you get so macho?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.696
Step class.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.066
Well, now that I've got
you feeling all relaxed,

18:54.100 --> 18:56.436
and confident, and
everything. there's

18:56.469 --> 18:58.104
something I want to tell you.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.240
But I'm afraid that's
going to upset you.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.275
Oh honey, I told you.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.643
I don't mind if you fake it.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.346
Just don't tell me.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.847
No.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.816
It's, OK, all right.

19:09.849 --> 19:15.822
Um, well recently, I was
talking to this person,

19:15.855 --> 19:20.927
you know, totally innocently,
and then they kissed me.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.895
Name?

19:22.929 --> 19:24.063
I know I shouldn't
have told you.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.532
I knew, I knew you
would freak out.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.267
Give me that guy's
name, Roseanne.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.601
Now.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.736
Because then you'll just do
something stupid that you're

19:29.769 --> 19:30.670
going to regret later.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.306
I'm your husband,
that's my right.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.441
Now where'd this
happen at work?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.209
No.
When I went out.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.778
Well from now on, you're
not going out without me.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.913
Now give me the guy's name!

19:40.947 --> 19:41.814
Well--

19:41.848 --> 19:43.115
Now!

19:43.149 --> 19:43.916
Sharon.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.188
Herb Sharon kissed you?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.694
No, Nancy's Sharon.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.936
A woman kissed you?

20:03.970 --> 20:04.937
Yeah.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.907
What was this, that gay bar?

20:07.940 --> 20:08.741
Yeah.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.648
I don't know what to say.

20:15.682 --> 20:19.819
Well, so-- you're not angry.

20:19.852 --> 20:26.526
No, I'm more concerned.

20:26.559 --> 20:32.031
I mean it must have been
very unpleasant for you.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.333
It was.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.334
It really was.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.702
It was the total
opposite of pleasant.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.505
It was unpleasant.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.308
So how'd it happen?

20:41.341 --> 20:45.011
She just walk up and kiss you?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.179
Well, no.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.080
Oh, no.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.516
You know, we were dancing.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.317
Wow.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.589
She's probably wearing
the tight leather

20:56.623 --> 20:58.558
stuff like the like, you know?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.459
Low-cut kind of thing.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.365
What does it matter
what she was wearing?

21:05.398 --> 21:06.833
No, it just--

21:06.866 --> 21:10.202
helping me imagine your
painful moment for you.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.005
[clapping]

21:13.039 --> 21:16.743
So, uh, suppose
she was probably

21:16.776 --> 21:19.879
one of those blonde hard
bodies that think they can just

21:19.912 --> 21:23.650
walk up and kiss some woman.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.184
Did you see her
kissing anybody else?

21:27.854 --> 21:30.156
You would really love
it at that bar, Dan.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.325
They got a lot of
men there, too.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.661
You know, and they're
rubbing their hard bodies

21:34.694 --> 21:37.797
up against each other,
and kissing each other.

21:41.401 --> 21:45.338
[clapping]

21:45.372 --> 21:47.774
I'm going to get
something to eat.
