WEBVTT

00:11.761 --> 00:14.304
Beth, where have you been?

00:14.389 --> 00:16.265
Where have I been? Um...

00:17.809 --> 00:19.226
Uh, long story.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.770
- Well?
- Well what?

00:22.355 --> 00:25.149
Did you meet the German?
I can't get a hold of her.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.778
Beth?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.865
- What?
- The German's dead.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.743
- Dead?
- Yeah, someone shot her, right in front of me!

00:35.785 --> 00:37.619
Oh, Jesus, are you all right?

00:37.662 --> 00:42.124
No, no, I'm not all right! She's in the back of
my car, there's blood everywhere!

00:42.208 --> 00:44.585
Holy shit! Holy shit, it's true...

00:45.128 --> 00:47.254
- What?
- That someone is killing us!

00:48.757 --> 00:50.632
They must've followed her from Europe!

00:50.717 --> 00:52.468
Jesus bloody Christ!

00:53.428 --> 00:54.887
- What?
- Nothing, nothing!

00:54.971 --> 00:57.806
Okay, okay, okay, did you get the briefcase?

00:57.849 --> 00:59.016
Um...

00:59.100 --> 01:00.392
- Beth?
- What...

01:00.477 --> 01:03.645
You know what? Worry about that later.
You need to get rid of the body!

01:04.063 --> 01:05.522
- How?
- I... I...

01:05.607 --> 01:06.815
- Like how?
- I don't know!

01:08.485 --> 01:10.986
You're the cop... Like buy a shovel.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.449
- Just make sure you get her samples.
- Ugh, samples?

01:16.201 --> 01:17.993
Hair and blood, Beth.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.496
You can do this.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.332
Um, how about you come help me?

01:23.374 --> 01:27.294
I would if I could.
Look, one step at a time, I'll call you back.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.210
Sorry, Elizabeth Childs.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.923
Freaks and punks and lost puppies.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.384
We always had a friend in Sarah.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.345
- You have a few words, Felix?
- Huh?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.930
Anything you want to express?

03:02.307 --> 03:05.684
Oh, no, I can't, Bob, I'm too verklempt.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.441
We're in Bummed Out City.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.903
Plead your mercy and your pity.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.281
Is not life

03:21.326 --> 03:22.701
a mirror maze.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.749
- To Sarah.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.501
- To Sarah.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.503
To Sarah.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.134
I can't figure out,

03:40.470 --> 03:41.553
why she killed herself.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.476
It's just not Sarah. it's not Sarah.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.859
Well, at least she had love.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.655
Whose love did she have? Yours?

04:00.531 --> 04:03.700
Love is imperfect.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.996
Love is imperfection itself.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.375
If that's your definition,
no wonder she jumped.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.503
- Shit...
- Whoa, whoa, take it easy!

04:14.545 --> 04:17.964
- Let him go, Vic.
- Say it. Go ahead, say it's my fault!

04:18.007 --> 04:21.510
- Say it's my fault!
- It's your fault.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.345
- Vic, be cool.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.184
- Everyone's raw, it's okay.
- All right!

04:30.019 --> 04:31.019
I'm sorry.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.064
My bad.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.860
I'm not a huggy griever, Vic.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.301
Katja Obinger.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.177
Berlin.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.019
Who the hell are you?

05:43.926 --> 05:45.969
Hey, what time do you open?

05:47.388 --> 05:50.223
Um, I need front and driver side window.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.233
Vic, I'm tired.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.985
Ah, one last drink.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.446
A bourbon for Sarah.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.115
Oh, Jesus!

06:13.122 --> 06:14.164
Very good.

06:16.876 --> 06:17.959
Okay,

06:18.628 --> 06:21.213
- off you go.
- Wait a minute. My turn.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.839
God.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.219
I want to get to know Sarah's daughter.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.388
- Out, Vic!
- Why not?

06:30.014 --> 06:32.724
- There's a reason you never met her.
- What is it?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.477
Well, let's see, for starters,
you're a drug dealer.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.145
I could help her financially.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.690
And Sarah left you.
She ran because you're abusive.

06:43.778 --> 06:47.197
- I want to make up for that.
- All right, let's go.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.157
- Let's go.
- Felix...

06:49.867 --> 06:51.743
I want to stay connected to her.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.663
- To who? Who?
- Her.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.667
Vic,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.585
Kira is not Sarah.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.673
Sarah's dead and she's not coming back.
You need to man up and accept that.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.843
Felix?

07:08.511 --> 07:09.678
- Hug me.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.868
- Oh, come on.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.497
Vic, I have a knife
and I will stab you in the face.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.374
Shit.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.421
Aren't you supposed to wait
like three days before rising?

07:44.922 --> 07:47.716
- What the hell is this?
- That is your wake.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.468
It was agony.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.053
Yeah, Vic was here. Why did you have one?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.389
Because I was mad at you, so I decided

07:54.432 --> 07:56.141
to blow all the money
from your stolen coke on it.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.646
Felix, does Kira think I'm dead?

08:03.691 --> 08:04.691
I don't know.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.068
Oh, you don't know.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.323
Vic screwed everything up
when he got hold of Mrs. S somehow.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.241
I don't know what she told Kira.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.620
- Vic.
- Yeah.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.623
- Since you died he's even more obsessed.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.416
He wants to meet Kira.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.003
- No.
- No. I know that.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.547
Of course not.
You think we'd let that happen?

08:30.635 --> 08:33.720
Hey, what's that? Right there, it looks like...

08:34.679 --> 08:36.306
Looks like blood.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.934
Hey, whoa, what's going on?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.477
- Nothing.
- Hey!

08:42.438 --> 08:44.564
Nothing, I don't want to talk about it.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.274
Sarah?

08:51.864 --> 08:54.866
Ah, you remember those birth certificates?

08:54.951 --> 08:58.537
- Yeah, Beth's and the two others?
- Yeah, Katja and Alison.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.288
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.624
- Well, I met the German.
- What?

09:03.709 --> 09:05.627
Is she another twin?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.630
Yeah.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.133
- Leave it out, Felix. Don't.
- Did she say who she was...

09:12.218 --> 09:15.303
- What did she say?
- I'm not getting into it... I can't...

09:15.346 --> 09:18.265
- I seriously cannot explain it.
- All right, fine.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.307
Stop.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.184
Look,

09:21.477 --> 09:24.145
I need you to tell Mrs. S, I'm not dead.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.564
Yeah? That it was all a mistake.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.149
No, no way, you do it.

09:28.818 --> 09:32.654
If I walk in there now, after 10 months, think
about how hard she can make custody.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.531
What, so I go in and I say what?

09:37.952 --> 09:38.994
Lie?

09:39.620 --> 09:40.996
Oh, my God.

09:41.247 --> 09:45.584
Tell her it wasn't me, I don't care, just make
sure Kira knows I'm fine.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.503
Yeah? We can still get out with her.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.632
That's my one bit of good news!

09:54.635 --> 09:58.346
- Is this evil twin's money?
- Yeah, $75,000 in cash!

09:59.015 --> 10:01.474
That's enough to lose Vic,
lose the twin sister weirdness,

10:01.517 --> 10:03.560
go somewhere safe with my daughter.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.520
Is that so much to ask?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.731
Yeah. Maybe.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.527
- What?
- Detective Arthur Bell.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.737
What?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.533
Bastard must have followed me and nicked it.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.953
All right. All right,
let's not go off though, okay?

10:22.413 --> 10:24.122
Hey, no... Let's not... Sarah!

10:24.206 --> 10:26.666
--Sarah... Sarah!

10:27.001 --> 10:29.002
Fuck! Fuck that!

10:29.545 --> 10:31.046
Bastard!

10:32.798 --> 10:33.882
Sarah...

10:34.467 --> 10:36.384
Whoa, hey, no, not that!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.553
I'm working on that.

10:43.267 --> 10:46.102
Maggie Chen. Who the hell is Maggie Chen?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.897
Uh, it's the woman Beth shot.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.232
All right, so now what are these?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.234
Right? Official statement.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.739
Detective Arthur Bell,
official statement. Detective Elizabeth Childs.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.240
What is this?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.743
This is... This is like the case.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.079
He left it for me...

11:04.830 --> 11:05.830
Her.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.918
If I want the money
back from Art, I have to be Beth again.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.962
Oh, for Christ's sake,
how long can you keep gaming a cop?

11:14.298 --> 11:15.632
Till I get our money.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.926
It's six in the morning.
You're going to call him now?

11:17.968 --> 11:21.805
- Yeah, believe me, this call he's waiting for.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.898
- Took you a while.
- What the hell are you doing?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.942
Me? I'm just following orders, Beth.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.444
- Orders to steal from me?
- Lieutenant said,

11:36.487 --> 11:40.031
"Take your rookie by the hand,
walk her right through the hearing."

11:42.576 --> 11:44.327
Did you stop to check it
before you crossed the border?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.705
Art, I'm at home. You got it all wrong.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.456
I never get it all wrong,

11:48.874 --> 11:50.709
- do I?
- Well, it's not what you think.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.961
Meet me at Fung's at noon.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.588
Fung's?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.010
What the hell's Fung's?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.559
Paul?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.065
- Where were you last night?
- Oh, shit!

12:14.150 --> 12:15.650
Don't do that.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.820
I... Um, I was at the station.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.948
I was, um, catching up on this back log.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.409
You're under suspension.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.329
Yeah, so? They reconvened the hearing.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.708
I have to get on top of this stuff.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.085
First you screw me wild
for the first time in months

12:34.170 --> 12:36.588
and then you don't even call me to tell
me that you're out all night?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.674
And why are you suddenly
dressing like a punk rock ho?

12:40.676 --> 12:41.968
Say again.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.095
No,

12:44.638 --> 12:46.848
you know what, don't.
I'm going to ignore that.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.851
I'm worried you're losing the plot again.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.519
We've been here before.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.189
No, Paul, we definitely
haven't been here before.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.194
Sorry, I've got... I've got a lot of work to do.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.489
If you want, I could take it
to the station, yeah?

13:03.491 --> 13:05.617
Beth, you're not ready
for this, you need to take more time.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.953
Is that a diagnosis? 'Cause I have
plenty of professional help for that.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.789
- Hey, please?
- Don't touch me!

13:13.626 --> 13:14.876
You know,

13:14.960 --> 13:16.586
I can see the shooting is killing you,

13:16.670 --> 13:19.881
- but you stopped talking to me months ago.
- Paul...

13:22.551 --> 13:25.386
- I mean, what am I supposed to do?
- It's my problem.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.891
- You don't have to take this on.
- Well, I have.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.937
And I can't keep waking up
every night, checking your breathing,

13:34.939 --> 13:38.149
worried you're mixing
your meds, booze, God knows what else.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.152
So... I'm going back to Cody's for a while.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.738
Okay.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.077
Yeah, if that's what you want.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.302
Punk rock ho?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.490
Oh! Hi, monkey!

14:28.284 --> 14:29.784
Did you see my mum?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.120
Oh, um... Sweetie...

14:34.915 --> 14:37.709
- Oi oi, Mrs. S.
- Go on upstairs, Kira love.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.338
Uncle Felix has got some explaining to do.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.511
I knew it was too good to be true.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.265
Sarah's too tough to commit suicide.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.559
Most feral mutt I ever took in.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.477
Don't shrug.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.147
Staging a funeral to get away from Vic.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.066
Why would you help such a stupid plan?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.569
--Vic's a dick.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.949
Plagued that girl was, from the very start.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.743
What do you mean by that?

15:12.328 --> 15:15.496
Tell her she hasn't seen
her daughter in almost a year and...

15:16.081 --> 15:17.415
I think it's best if it stays like that.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.834
Why don't you tell her yourself, Siobhan?

15:20.502 --> 15:22.837
- I'm not going to play Felix in the middle.
- Oh, no?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.589
You're here at her beck and call, aren't you?

15:24.673 --> 15:28.676
Yes, I am. To make sure
that Kira doesn't think that her mother's dead.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.470
And, oh good, look, she doesn't.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.266
You and Sarah, you can work out the rest.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.852
Years of my life. Leaving London.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.189
All my people there,
to bring the two of you here for a fresh start.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.818
I'd do it all again, Felix.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.820
Every visit from the bloody police about her,

15:47.863 --> 15:50.156
every missing persons report.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.534
Every punch we threw.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.536
Because Kira

15:56.538 --> 15:58.873
- is a gift.
- Sarah knows that.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.459
No.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.963
She hasn't a clue.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.966
She is trying.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.677
Badly. Granted.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.096
But in her own way, she is, she's really trying.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.767
Oh, ho ho!

16:18.686 --> 16:21.312
Caught ya! Come here, come here, monkey!

16:26.735 --> 16:29.112
--When is Mummy coming?

16:30.572 --> 16:32.031
You know when, love.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.077
- When she's ready.
- And?

16:38.163 --> 16:40.164
When you say she's ready.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.417
Sounds fair to me.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.679
Right here.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.472
Right where I thought I saw Yip.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.644
That's when I drew my weapon.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.146
She...

17:03.230 --> 17:04.396
What did she do?

17:12.239 --> 17:14.115
It's not a payoff, Art.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.199
It's not.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.868
Then cut the shit, Beth,
and tell me where it came from.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.122
It's Paul's, okay? it's Paul's and mine.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.958
I cleaned out ourjoint savings account.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.419
I haven't told him yet.

17:27.921 --> 17:31.799
Yeah, I was going to leave town.
But I couldn't do it, okay? I turned around.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.928
- For Paul?
- To clear the shooting, Art.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.391
I'm not dirty, I just freaked out.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.147
Are you wearing a wire?

17:46.857 --> 17:49.317
- No.
- You never saw the vic, before.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.403
- No previous contact with Margaret Chen?
- No!

17:52.821 --> 17:53.821
Art.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.991
If there is another version of this story,

17:57.034 --> 18:00.495
- if that money is somehow connected...
- There's only one story, Art.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.960
Walk me through it again.
So I know you won't crack under questioning.

18:10.005 --> 18:13.382
I was by myself,
I was canvassing witnesses on another case.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.969
- Which case?
- The Ramsey thing, the Sun Jewelry heist.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.181
The Ramsey thing, Sun Jewelry heist.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.476
- I wasn't even looking for Yip...
- Yip, who?

18:23.519 --> 18:25.728
Xan Yip, US racketeering warrant.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.356
I'd seen her sheet
that morning, Asian, female, 41.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.899
And?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.028
And...

18:34.571 --> 18:37.323
Right here, where I thought I saw Yip...

18:37.616 --> 18:40.243
- You thought?
- I did, I saw her.

18:41.203 --> 18:45.790
I called her name, I told her to freeze.
She didn't. She ran. Disappeared down.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.545
- You're making me nervous.
- Good.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.131
Now you know how it feels.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.007
When did you draw your weapon?

18:56.260 --> 18:58.094
I drew when I entered the courtyard here.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.681
That's when I drew my weapon
and then she disappeared down there.

19:01.723 --> 19:05.226
I crossed her there
and that's when I heard somebody behind me.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.729
And I turned around and I fired twice.

19:26.081 --> 19:29.417
--They were both firing back. it wasn't her.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.586
It wasn't her.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.255
Then what?

19:35.549 --> 19:38.801
Then I saw the phone
in her hand and I called it in.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.263
And then you showed up.

19:43.974 --> 19:47.143
If they find out that
you called me before you called it in, Beth...

19:47.227 --> 19:48.978
They're gonna start to dig.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.771
And if they dig, they find the pills.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.316
And if they find the pills,
you may crack under questioning,

19:53.400 --> 19:57.153
and tell them that I put the phone in the vic's
hand to cover your tweaker ass.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.118
I wouldn't do that, Art.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.539
No, I've got to carry what I did.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.086
Maggie Chen was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.130
That's it.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.468
None of this ends up on you.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.887
Good.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.723
But to be sure,

20:26.725 --> 20:29.310
I'm going to hang on
to that money until you're cleared.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.646
How's that?

20:46.036 --> 20:49.163
Kira's fine, you're not dead to your daughter.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.957
--Come here.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.047
She's knows I'm back, doesn't she?
I can feel her.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.800
- She knows, she's been asking for you.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.134
All right.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.386
Okay, what about Mrs. S?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.514
Don't worry about that now, okay?
We'll work it out later.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.059
- Thank you.
- Just take us with you when you leave again.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.354
I promise, I promise, I promise, I will.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.523
- Do you want a cuppa?
- Yeah.

21:16.817 --> 21:20.820
So, Art won't give me
the money until I clear Beth's shooting.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.322
What do you mean?
Like, go back in front of the police board?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.533
Like, lawyers
and cross-examination and stuff?

21:25.617 --> 21:26.617
Yeah.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.372
That's the least of my worries.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.792
That's Beth's other phone.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.004
Is that the German?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.339
It's definitely not the German.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.801
All right, I think it's time
that you tell me what's actually going on.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.304
- Beth was investigating the twins, too.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.682
I think whatever she found out
drove her nuts and she topped herself.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.350
What?

21:51.601 --> 21:53.185
- So do I pick up?
- No!

21:53.478 --> 21:55.187
- No!

21:55.522 --> 21:58.274
- I can't help myself.
- Then why even ask?

22:00.402 --> 22:02.695
Hello, this is Beth.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.739
Finally! Where have you been?

22:05.282 --> 22:06.907
Busy, obviously.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.743
Right, did you get
the German's briefcase?

22:08.785 --> 22:10.578
No. Why?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.830
Because I told you to.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.166
Where is she staying, Beth?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.462
- Hello?
- One sec.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.174
Okay.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.762
Uh, Carlsborough Hotel, room 303.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.973
Well,
go get the briefcase before they do.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.225
- I'll call back at midnight.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.268
What's in...

22:35.437 --> 22:36.604
What's in the briefcase?

22:36.772 --> 22:37.855
Who is that?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.776
Every time I think
I learn something, I'm wrong.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.694
Whoa, hold on.

22:45.906 --> 22:51.077
Beth, Katja and Alison Hendrix. Is that her?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.120
I don't know, Felix.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.705
But what happened to the German?

22:55.791 --> 22:57.208
Are you seriously going there?

22:57.292 --> 22:59.043
Don't you wanna know
what's in the briefcase?

22:59.127 --> 23:00.127
No!

23:01.546 --> 23:02.630
Cash?

23:03.048 --> 23:04.632
It's still a hustle, Fe.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.136
- Can I borrow this?
- No. Yeah. I don't know.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.721
Mmmm.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.600
Guten Morgen, Katja Obinger.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.019
- Sarah...
- Don't worry.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.687
You actually look kind of hot.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.314
It's good, isn't it?

23:39.543 --> 23:44.088
Miss Obinger.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.509
Miss Obinger!

23:54.391 --> 23:55.724
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.065
Shit!

25:36.451 --> 25:38.077
Yeah?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.287
Hello. Avery from the front desk.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.831
Could we talk with you downstairs, please?

25:46.127 --> 25:47.670
Why would you go in my room?

25:47.754 --> 25:50.965
We had a noise complaint
which led to a security check.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.550
Ma'am, your room is trashed.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.094
Rock and roll.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.387
Rock and roll?

25:57.305 --> 25:59.640
The sink is broken.
What the heck is wrong with you?

26:00.100 --> 26:02.142
Unfortunately, we have an itemized bill.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.604
Sink, mirror, three pillows.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.191
$6,000?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.902
$6,437.11, yes.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.153
Yeah.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.745
So, you have my card on file, yeah?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.038
Yes.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.501
And my briefcase.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.507
One moment.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.556
Authorizing.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.233
Must have been a heck of a party.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.951
Everything appears to be in order.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.704
We're very sorry about this.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.374
Are you enjoying the city?

27:07.709 --> 27:08.751
It's killing me.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.004
Danke schön.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.973
Danielle Fournier.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.443
Katja.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.703
Austrian.

28:27.956 --> 28:28.956
Italian.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.962
Danielle Fournier, France.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.847
Alison Hendrix.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.057
Scarborough.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.018
You're practically local.

28:51.479 --> 28:52.646
--And punctual.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.821
- Hello.
- Hey, did you get to the hotel?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.449
Yeah, but, uh...

29:03.491 --> 29:05.659
Somebody got there first.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.327
They ransacked her room.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.329
Shit.

29:09.789 --> 29:10.789
No briefcase?

29:11.332 --> 29:12.499
I didn't say that.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.752
Did you find it or not?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.754
Hang on.

29:21.885 --> 29:22.885
Screw it.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
Hello.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.055
- Who am I speaking to?
- Beth?

29:29.350 --> 29:31.518
- Alison?
- Who is this?

29:32.854 --> 29:33.937
Who is this?

29:34.522 --> 29:36.899
Beth's indisposed. Is this Alison?

29:38.276 --> 29:41.153
Just one. I'm a few, no family, too. Who am I?

29:41.237 --> 29:43.989
Yeah, sorry, riddler. it means nothing to me.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.994
Look, Beth said to say I have the briefcase.

29:49.662 --> 29:50.662
Do you want me to bring it to you?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.434
35, Black Oak Drive.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.434
You stop it.

31:36.185 --> 31:37.185
You stop it.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.816
Hey, hey, hey! Don't hurt her.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.318
Holy shite!

31:49.616 --> 31:50.866
A soccer mom!

31:53.453 --> 31:55.370
Okay, follow your sister. Don't run.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.041
Good boy. Good boy.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.173
- There you go.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.261
Hello.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.685
Go. Go, go.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.274
Vivian, I'm gonna cut the...

33:20.957 --> 33:23.667
--I just want some answers.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.253
Are you out of your mind?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.923
How dare you show your face
in front of my children?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.008
How did you find me?

33:31.300 --> 33:32.759
German had your address.

33:34.303 --> 33:35.804
I've got what you wanted.
I've got her briefcase.

33:38.099 --> 33:41.101
Idiot. Do you even know
who you're talking to? Hmm?

33:42.603 --> 33:43.645
Where is Beth?

33:44.981 --> 33:46.440
Uh, she's dead.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.110
What?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.904
I'm sorry, she killed herself.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.115
No.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.201
No. No, she wouldn't do that.
That's impossible.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.412
I'm... I'm sorry, I saw her do it.

34:02.457 --> 34:03.457
No, that can't be.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.667
I can explain, okay?

34:05.752 --> 34:08.335
- My name's Sarah...
- I don't care who you are.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.630
Why, Lord?

34:11.174 --> 34:12.174
Why me?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.632
I never wanted any part of this.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.094
Do I wear a huge "kick me" sign on my back?

34:16.137 --> 34:19.306
Please, just tell me who are we to each other?

34:21.391 --> 34:22.516
Are you kidding me?

34:23.643 --> 34:24.643
I'm not doing that.

34:25.353 --> 34:26.855
Nope, that is not my responsibility.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.817
You need to get out of here.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.654
Go and wait for a call.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.908
- Hey, tell me what the...
- Let go. Don't touch me!

34:39.202 --> 34:40.952
This is my neighborhood.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.455
You wait for a call.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.667
Oh, and hide your ugly face
on the way out of here.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.670
--Bitch!

34:53.466 --> 34:55.092
Okay, oranges, guys.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.305
Come on.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.562
- I'll take two.
- Yeah, you take two.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.826
- What's up, Art?
- Where are you?

35:20.868 --> 35:22.869
I'm at home in the tub with a bourbon.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.205
- Can you hear me knocking?

35:25.540 --> 35:27.499
No? Because you're not home.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.000
Okay, I'm in Scarborough.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.585
What? Why?

35:31.295 --> 35:34.631
I had to go to Bed, Bath & Beyond,
okay, nobody wants to admit that.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.383
Look, whatever, Beth.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.218
What the hell did you say to the shrink?

35:38.344 --> 35:39.928
She's ruling you unfit for duty.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.179
What? Why?

35:41.389 --> 35:44.266
Yeah. Unfit means no hearing tomorrow.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.725
Oh, shit!

35:45.852 --> 35:47.811
It means this crap goes on and on.

35:47.937 --> 35:50.188
And guess what?
I'm keeping your money until it ends.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.773
- I'll go see her now.
- No, no, no.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.233
It's too late for that, Beth.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.235
Get me another appointment, okay?

35:55.278 --> 35:57.904
Tell her it's an emergency,
you're worried about me.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.031
She's my doctor, she has to see me.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.075
And what are you
gonna say to her to change her mind?

36:03.911 --> 36:05.120
I'll figure something out.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.623
I'm sorry.
My opinion is you're not ready for duty.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.084
I am though.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.295
I'm making progress, full progress.

36:13.921 --> 36:14.921
Go on.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.216
You know, with the guilt, um...

36:19.177 --> 36:21.136
Seeing cell phone and reacting gun.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.346
You're just
parroting our last meeting back to me.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.515
No, I'm admitting my mistake.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.020
Dr. Bowers,
I'm acknowledging it, like you said.

36:30.938 --> 36:33.356
Honestly, the best thing for me
now is to get back to work.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.859
Last time I saw you,
you couldn't remember the shooting.

36:36.569 --> 36:41.448
"I'm missing myself.
I glitched. A break or something."

36:42.742 --> 36:43.992
I remember it just fine.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.785
What I'm trying to do is move on.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.080
Sorry, Beth, but considering
your mental state leading up to the incident...

36:49.123 --> 36:51.416
- That's behind me now...
- And by your own admission

36:51.500 --> 36:53.835
of blackout or psychotic break,

36:53.920 --> 36:55.712
I can't recommend you for duty.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.466
That's not gonna work for me.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.218
I understand, you're a cop.

37:02.637 --> 37:03.929
But this is my job.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.141
Can you read that back again?

37:08.643 --> 37:11.853
That, uh, I'm missing myself, I glitched.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.399
Does that sound stoned to you?

37:17.193 --> 37:18.401
Glitch sound stoned?

37:18.486 --> 37:22.030
Uh, tweaked, gakked, spun?

37:23.783 --> 37:28.245
Alevia, superprax, draxophyl.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.957
What is the difference between a mood
stabilizer and an antipsychotic, again?

37:31.999 --> 37:34.584
- Beth!
- No, sorry, I've been confused.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.670
I mean, it's very confusing.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.088
Um...

37:38.172 --> 37:41.841
Antidepressants, antianxieties, SSRls.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.927
Serotronax. That one's a stimulant.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.137
We have known each other
for a while now, Beth.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.555
Yeah, that's where you're wrong.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.226
You have constantly tested me
with your personal appeals for prescriptions.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.521
I know. My bad.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.357
So, I'll just explain to the board

37:57.441 --> 38:01.027
that I shot this poor civilian
after mixing up all your overlapping scrips.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.200
Or am I making progress?

38:12.248 --> 38:15.792
All right, if everybody's here, let's
see if we could do this again.

38:16.544 --> 38:20.964
Board convenes in a fatal line-of-duty
shooting, October seventh of this year.

38:21.882 --> 38:24.342
State your name and rank for the record.

38:25.219 --> 38:26.261
And begin.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.724
Detective Elizabeth Childs.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.149
You did well.
We'll have a ruling in a couple of days.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.233
Okay.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.993
- This is Sarah.
- Well, Sarah, this will be quick.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.161
Good.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.872
Since you apparently
already know where I live,

38:53.914 --> 38:56.958
and I can't find a sitter,
come by after 9:00 tonight.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.418
- How about right now?
- Tonight!

38:59.003 --> 39:00.420
Bring whatever you got from the German.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.547
Go around back and go to the basement door.

39:02.757 --> 39:03.840
- Knock quietly.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.427
Not bad, Childs.

39:08.804 --> 39:09.804
Not bad.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.355
I nailed it, man.

39:18.814 --> 39:19.814
Every detail.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.941
Yeah, they haven't ruled yet.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.485
Please contain your excitement.

39:23.569 --> 39:24.819
This is me excited.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.448
Come on, Art, give me a little love here. Yeah?

39:29.116 --> 39:30.617
Why do you have to be such a hard-ass?

39:30.701 --> 39:33.370
'Cause it's your favorite thing about me.

39:36.874 --> 39:40.293
Look, uh, Paul doesn't know
that I took that money out of our account.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.422
So just let me put it back
before he finds out, yeah?

39:45.132 --> 39:48.009
I hang on to it till you're reinstated.
That's the deal.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.470
There was no deal. it was just you...

39:50.554 --> 39:51.930
Looking out for you.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.182
Partner.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.315
Oh, my God!

40:02.650 --> 40:04.734
Ugh! You know I never would have got in

40:04.819 --> 40:07.320
if you said we were going to suburbia.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.030
Oi, what you doing?

40:09.115 --> 40:11.825
Don't stop, someone might speak to us.

40:11.867 --> 40:12.992
God!

40:13.661 --> 40:14.661
Christ!

40:15.704 --> 40:19.290
You know, my skin
just breaks out every time I leave downtown.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.127
Yeah. Yeah, right there. Look.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.336
Acne.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.256
I don't see acne.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.882
Am I blushing?

40:28.509 --> 40:30.385
There's redness, it's right there.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.262
Tiny little suburban stress zits

40:32.346 --> 40:34.597
emerging in direct proximity
to bad architecture.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.350
Look, Fe, I'm gonna have
the money in a couple days.

40:38.185 --> 40:41.771
Okay? And then, look,
I'll make good with Mrs. S,

40:42.064 --> 40:46.067
and we'll take Kira somewhere quiet, yeah?
Somewhere warm.

40:46.318 --> 40:48.445
Yeah. Please.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.614
So, what's in the house?

40:53.701 --> 40:55.493
- Won't be long.
- What? Oh, my God.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.870
Who's in there?

40:56.954 --> 40:59.205
- Stay here, okay?
- Is it the German?

41:01.500 --> 41:02.500
The German's dead.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.085
She's dead! She died!

41:04.253 --> 41:05.253
Sadly, yes.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.382
This one's an uptight soccer mom.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.135
Whoa, hey, Sarah, you always do this to me.

41:12.219 --> 41:14.345
I just need you to be my backup, okay?

41:14.388 --> 41:17.599
I don't do backup.
I don't even know what backup is.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.560
- Give me half an hour.
- What am I supposed to do till then?

41:20.644 --> 41:23.605
Nothing. Just need somebody
to know where I am.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.274
That is not comforting. Sarah!

41:27.651 --> 41:28.651
Shit.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.719
Close it. Lock it.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.603
- Really?

42:03.979 --> 42:05.188
Be quiet, my kids are sleeping.

42:05.397 --> 42:07.190
You're gonna shoot me
while your kids are sleeping.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.734
You wake them or show your face,
yes, I will shoot you.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.569
Well, I've never known a blood relation,

42:11.779 --> 42:13.571
but being your twin certainly sucks!

42:13.614 --> 42:15.281
You really have no idea, do you?

42:19.203 --> 42:21.329
Hey. I'm Cosima.

42:21.872 --> 42:22.997
Bloody hell!

42:23.415 --> 42:24.749
We talked on the phone.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.044
How many of us are there?

42:33.300 --> 42:34.634
We're clones.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.636
We're someone's experiment
and they're killing us off.

42:36.762 --> 42:37.929
Is that helpful?

42:38.138 --> 42:39.806
- Oh, my God!
- What are you doing in my yard?

42:40.224 --> 42:42.100
You want answers,
I want the briefcase.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.768
Seriously, it's life or death.

42:44.061 --> 42:46.145
What kind of a mother am I
if I snatch my own daughter?

42:47.565 --> 42:48.815
You're reinstated.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.775
Holy shit.

42:51.151 --> 42:54.112
Yes, I'm at the bloody crime scene
pretending to be a bloody cop.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.781
So I need to know if the bloody
fingerprints will flag a bloody match.

42:59.326 --> 43:00.326
Freeze! Police!

43:00.494 --> 43:01.619
Beth!
