10:09.867 --> 10:11.800
I ACTUALLY GREW UP IN JERSEY,

10:11.800 --> 10:15.400
BUT I MOVED DOWN THERE A FEW

10:15.400 --> 10:15.800
YEARS AGO.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.733
>> IT'S TOO HOT.

10:16.733 --> 10:17.400
I'M TOO FAT FOR THE HEAT.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.867

10:37.100 --> 10:37.633

10:37.633 --> 10:38.967
I RIPPED ONE ONE DAY.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.933
IT SOUNDED GREAT.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.000
SHOWED IT TO MY FRIENDS.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.167
THEY LOVED IT, AND THEN PAUL

HAPPY, SMILING FACE FOR PEOPLE

13:04.333 --> 13:04.900

13:04.900 --> 13:06.200
>> IS THIS THE FIRST TIME YOU

13:06.200 --> 13:07.267
WERE A SECURITY GUARD?

13:07.267 --> 13:08.067
>> NO.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.267
I DID SECURITY AT A FEW HOTELS

13:10.267 --> 13:11.367

13:23.567 --> 13:25.567
ONE TIME I SAT IN A REFRIGERATOR

DO IT ANYWHERE EXCEPT ON A

17:35.633 --> 17:36.067
TRAMPOLINE.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.500
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU

18:33.233 --> 18:34.900

DON HENLEY GETS ENOUGH CREDIT

19:09.167 --> 19:11.333

19:57.067 --> 19:59.533
BOYCOTT GUYS NAMED ZACH.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.733
FINALLY, COMEDY IS NOT ABOUT

20:01.733 --> 20:03.667
JOKES ANYMORE, OR SO I'M TOLD.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.567
AS YOU KNOW, I CLAIM TO BE A

20:05.567 --> 20:07.200
PROPHET, AND WHEN I FIRST CAME

20:07.200 --> 20:08.833
ACROSS THIS DISTURBING YOUTUBE

20:08.833 --> 20:11.067
CHANNEL A YEAR AGO, IT TOOK ME

20:11.067 --> 20:13.533
LESS THAN A HALF SECOND TO

20:13.533 --> 20:16.533
REALIZE THIS WAS FOR SEX

20:16.533 --> 20:16.967
OFFENDERS.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.467
YEAH, TURNS OUT I WAS 100% RIGHT

20:19.467 --> 20:21.200
BECAUSE THE CREATOR WAS RECENTLY

20:21.200 --> 20:29.167
ARRESTED FOR BEING A CHOMO.

20:29.167 --> 20:30.633
THAT'S ALL I GET FOR GETTING A

20:30.633 --> 20:32.267
PEDOPHILE OFF THE STREETS?

20:32.267 --> 20:38.700
[ APPLAUSE ]

20:38.700 --> 20:39.067
>> WHOA.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.533
THANKS FOR THE CREDIT, BUZZFEED.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.000
IT IS SO GRATIFYING TO FINALLY

20:43.000 --> 20:48.200
BE RECOGNIZED BY MY PEERS IN THE

20:48.200 --> 20:48.533

WHERE IS MY TEEN'S CHOICE AWARD.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.567
SENT ME A SURF BOARD, ASSHOLES.

20:52.567 --> 20:56.100
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL OFFSET SOME

20:56.100 --> 20:56.867
OF THE MANY BAD THINGS I'VE SAID

20:56.867 --> 20:57.333
IN THE PAST.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.900
I DON'T NEED TO BRING THEM UP,

20:58.900 --> 21:00.267
BUT LET'S JUST SAY I DON'T HAVE

21:00.267 --> 21:00.900
A SPOTLESS TRACK RECORD.

21:00.900 --> 21:10.067
GOOD NIGHT.

21:10.067 --> 21:11.067
>> KWHA DO YOU THINK YOUR NEXT

21:11.067 --> 21:12.067
JOB IS GOING TO BE?

21:12.067 --> 21:13.933
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL TAKE A NEXT

21:13.933 --> 21:14.267
JOB?

21:14.267 --> 21:14.967
>> WE'LL DO SOMETHING.

21:14.967 --> 21:16.533

21:16.533 --> 21:18.100
HEY, WE'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE,

21:18.100 --> 21:19.300
WE NEED YOU BACK?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.533

21:21.533 --> 21:22.067
AFFORD ME NOW.

21:22.067 --> 21:22.833
>> WHAT'S DONE IT S DONE.
