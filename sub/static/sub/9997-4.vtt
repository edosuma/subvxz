00:03.200 --> 00:04.500
My God, John.

00:08.103 --> 00:10.439
Look at you.

00:24.254 --> 00:26.355
I just talked to your doctors.

00:26.423 --> 00:28.090
You're dying.

00:28.158 --> 00:31.594
I want you to admit
what you did, john.

00:31.661 --> 00:34.096
I want you to admit
what you are.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.464
(mumbles)

00:35.532 --> 00:39.535
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A. System)

00:44.441 --> 00:46.208

Francine bickford.

00:50.947 --> 00:53.349
Ann marie mays.

00:56.553 --> 00:59.288
I want you to say
that you did it, john.

00:59.356 --> 01:02.124
I want you to say it to me.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.594
I'm the only one who still
cares about what you did.

01:05.662 --> 01:08.697
The police--
they stopped investigating
these murders years ago.

01:08.765 --> 01:10.833
Look at you, john.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.669
They can't put you
in prison now.

01:13.737 --> 01:15.804
You beat us all.

01:15.872 --> 01:17.940
You got away with it.

01:18.008 --> 01:20.743
Don't you want to take
the credit for that?

01:23.146 --> 01:26.282
C-cigarette?

01:36.293 --> 01:38.127
(clicks lighter)

01:53.743 --> 01:55.744
(groaning softly)

01:55.812 --> 01:58.280
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A. System)

02:00.383 --> 02:01.717
Now...

02:01.785 --> 02:04.486
Tell me.

02:04.554 --> 02:07.056
You did it,
didn't you?

02:19.769 --> 02:21.770
(quietly):
No.

02:26.643 --> 02:28.277
You're lying.

02:28.345 --> 02:29.712
Wake up.

02:29.779 --> 02:31.146
Come on, wake up

02:31.214 --> 02:32.548
And admit you did it!

02:32.615 --> 02:33.816
Admit it was you,

02:33.883 --> 02:35.351
You bastard!

02:35.418 --> 02:36.719
Admit it was you!

02:36.786 --> 02:38.721
Admit it was you, you bastard!

02:38.788 --> 02:40.255
Admit it was you!

02:40.323 --> 02:41.323
Admit it!

02:41.391 --> 02:43.592
Admit it!

02:43.660 --> 02:45.961
Admit...

02:46.029 --> 02:49.965
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:32.417 --> 03:33.851
Arrow, hand.

03:33.919 --> 03:35.319
Perfect.

03:35.387 --> 03:36.954
How about...

03:37.022 --> 03:38.189
That?

03:38.256 --> 03:40.124
Arrow, fish, hand,

03:40.192 --> 03:41.292
Star, pyramid.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.060
Excellent.

03:43.128 --> 03:44.228
I don't understand.

03:44.296 --> 03:45.396
How is that rehab?

03:45.464 --> 03:47.431
I mean, anyone
can read flash cards

03:47.499 --> 03:48.733
Without words on 'em.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.067
No, see, you're wrong.

03:50.135 --> 03:52.069
Okay, when people go through
something g like mom,

03:52.137 --> 03:54.105
When they're
in a coma for a while,

03:54.172 --> 03:56.340
Sometimes they mess up
the way they see things.

03:56.408 --> 03:58.109
So it's important for mom to do

03:58.176 --> 04:00.611
Her drills, so that we
know that mom's head

04:00.679 --> 04:01.979
Is working right.
Joe:
Actually,

04:02.047 --> 04:03.981
The official term
for what your mom is doing

04:04.049 --> 04:05.082
Is "cognitive therapy."

04:06.385 --> 04:09.320
When she does it--
which is not often enough.

04:09.388 --> 04:10.488
I'm fine.

04:10.555 --> 04:11.989
My cognitive skills
are excellent.

04:12.057 --> 04:14.291
When it comes to seeing
stars, fish, and arrows,

04:14.359 --> 04:16.594
I'm at the top of my game.
How about

04:16.661 --> 04:19.529
We let the folks
at rehab decide that?

04:20.565 --> 04:22.500
You look nice, daddy.

04:22.567 --> 04:24.168
(groans):
Thank you.

04:24.236 --> 04:27.338
Here's hoping the good people
at burroughs-strauss agree.

04:27.406 --> 04:28.673
Now, wait a second.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.675
Didn't you already
dress up and go there?

04:30.742 --> 04:31.942
Good memory.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.778
Excellent cognition, bridge.

04:33.845 --> 04:35.680
Yes, indeed-- I had
a good first meeting there,

04:35.747 --> 04:37.348
And today is the big day,

04:37.416 --> 04:39.550
Because today
I meet the guy who, uh,

04:39.618 --> 04:41.652
Who runs the department,
and if everything

04:41.720 --> 04:43.587
Goes well with him
and I impress him,

04:43.655 --> 04:46.757
Well, then I may be done
with dressing up

04:46.825 --> 04:49.827
And interviewing for a while,
maybe even forever.

04:49.895 --> 04:52.229
Hey, you know what.
We got to get a move on.

04:52.297 --> 04:54.265
I got to be at therapy
in 45 minutes.

04:54.332 --> 04:56.000
Mommy, did you sign my thing?

04:56.068 --> 05:00.471
Oh, right, the permission slip
for that field trip next week.

05:00.539 --> 05:03.541
I just have to remember
where I put it.

05:03.608 --> 05:06.577
You can't remember where
you put that thing?

05:08.780 --> 05:10.381
Hey, you know what,
I'm gonna make

05:10.449 --> 05:11.816
My own permission slip.

05:11.883 --> 05:14.685
I'm gonna make a note
for your teacher,

05:14.753 --> 05:18.022
And if she has any problems,
she can call me, okay?

05:18.090 --> 05:20.324
Okay, mommy.

05:20.392 --> 05:22.693
Dollar sign, triangle, hammer,

05:22.761 --> 05:25.429
House, and that last one,
I don't know

05:25.496 --> 05:28.598
What you would call it--
looks... Kind of like a tunnel?

05:28.666 --> 05:30.100
A tunnel? Really?

05:30.168 --> 05:33.203
Are you sure you don't want
to take another look?

05:34.739 --> 05:37.607
I'm sorry.

05:37.675 --> 05:39.276
It's a tree.

05:39.343 --> 05:42.345
That's so weird,
the first time I looked at it...
I wouldn't worry

05:42.413 --> 05:43.914
About it, allison;
it's really common

05:43.981 --> 05:45.816
For someone recovering
from a stroke

05:45.883 --> 05:49.853
To have lapses in memory,
gaps in perception.

05:49.921 --> 05:51.488
We call it
"expressive aphasia."

05:51.556 --> 05:54.257
The flash card exercises
just work the muscle,

05:54.325 --> 05:56.359
Keep it from getting
too serious.

05:56.427 --> 05:58.061
But my stroke was months ago.

05:58.129 --> 05:59.296
I've been fine.

05:59.363 --> 06:01.865
I haven't had any
perception problems before.

06:01.933 --> 06:03.800
These things
come and go.

06:03.868 --> 06:06.903
The one thing that really
helps is practice.

06:06.971 --> 06:09.306
Have you been using
your cards at home?

06:09.373 --> 06:11.775
Well, I did look at them
this morning...

06:11.843 --> 06:14.077
(exhales):
It probably wouldn't hurt

06:14.145 --> 06:16.580
<i>For you to be a little
more disciplined.</i>

06:16.647 --> 06:17.914
(laughs nervously)

06:17.982 --> 06:19.282
Okay.

06:27.892 --> 06:30.727
(sighs)

06:34.732 --> 06:36.800
Man:
Someone's got
flash card anxiety.

06:38.469 --> 06:40.103
Sorry.

06:40.171 --> 06:42.105
I couldn't help myself.

06:42.173 --> 06:44.107
I was watching you.

06:44.175 --> 06:45.575
It's that obvious, huh?

06:45.643 --> 06:47.143
Well, for me it is.

06:47.211 --> 06:51.147
But I've been playing
with those cards for years.

06:51.215 --> 06:53.783
You want a little tip?

06:53.851 --> 06:57.654
Try reading them
from right to left.

06:57.722 --> 07:00.156
Yeah. I know it sounds stupid,

07:00.224 --> 07:03.093
But there's something
about reading them backwards

07:03.160 --> 07:05.862
That forces your brain
to pay attention.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.498
Mm.
At least... It works for me.

07:08.566 --> 07:11.401
Well, thanks.
I'll try that.

07:11.469 --> 07:13.770
My name's neal,
by the way.

07:13.838 --> 07:16.106
I'm a veteran
of more cognitive therapy

07:16.173 --> 07:18.208
Than you'd ever care
to remember.

07:18.276 --> 07:21.411
My name's allison.
Allison dubois.

07:21.479 --> 07:22.879
Um...

07:22.947 --> 07:26.182
You said that you'd-you'd
had a lot of therapy.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.953
Do you mind if I ask you
what happened to you?

07:30.021 --> 07:32.122
I got mugged.

07:32.189 --> 07:34.391
Guy shot me,

07:34.458 --> 07:37.193
Left me, uh,
to bleed in the street.

07:37.261 --> 07:39.362
Had some, uh...

07:39.430 --> 07:41.197
Brain impairment.

07:41.265 --> 07:44.167
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
Thanks.

07:44.235 --> 07:45.635
Wherever the guy is,

07:45.703 --> 07:49.306
I hope he, uh, had a good time
with the $22 he took from me.

07:49.373 --> 07:51.207
They never found the man
who did this to you?

07:51.275 --> 07:52.909
No.

07:52.977 --> 07:55.645
(ringtone playing)
oh. Forgive me.

07:57.782 --> 07:59.716
Oh, it's a work call.

07:59.784 --> 08:02.986
(quietly):
Remember: Try to read them
backwards.

08:03.054 --> 08:05.188
Hello?

08:05.256 --> 08:07.123
Sorry to bother you
on your day off,

08:07.191 --> 08:10.226
But I was hoping maybe
you could meet me at the morgue.

08:10.294 --> 08:12.162
The girl's name's
catherine tallridge.

08:12.229 --> 08:14.598
My best guess is
about 1:00 last night

08:14.665 --> 08:16.333
Someone came up
the fire escape,

08:16.400 --> 08:18.401
Broke into her place
through a window,

08:18.469 --> 08:20.670
Strangled her, then
left the way he came.

08:20.738 --> 08:22.405
How can you be so sure

08:22.473 --> 08:24.741
It was around 1:00?
One of the
neighbors

08:24.809 --> 08:26.576
Heard a commotion
coming from the place.

08:26.644 --> 08:28.411
He even called in
a noise complaint.

08:28.479 --> 08:31.247
By the time the squad car
got there, everything was quiet.

08:31.315 --> 08:33.350
No one answered the door.

08:33.417 --> 08:34.551
The roommate got back

08:34.619 --> 08:35.986
From sleeping over
at her friend's place.

08:38.089 --> 08:40.423
Found her like that.

08:41.926 --> 08:44.193
You have any idea
what that symbol

08:44.260 --> 08:45.862
On her head means?

08:45.930 --> 08:47.497
Symbol?

08:50.935 --> 08:53.303
Joe:
Obviously, my most
recent experience

08:53.371 --> 08:55.238
Is with solar cells.

08:55.306 --> 08:57.007
(crunching loudly)

08:57.074 --> 08:59.709
I know it's not a perfect fit
for, you know,

08:59.777 --> 09:02.545
What you do here, but I figure
there are some parallels

09:02.613 --> 09:05.081
That make me a...
Good candidate.

09:05.149 --> 09:07.651
(gulping)

09:07.718 --> 09:09.786
Solar, huh?

09:09.854 --> 09:12.622
Yeah. Uh, I started a company;
I sold it last year.

09:12.690 --> 09:14.391
Um, did your
human resources department

09:14.458 --> 09:16.159
Not send you down a rÃ©sumÃ©?

09:16.227 --> 09:18.762
(crunching)

09:18.829 --> 09:23.333
Yeah, I-I-I think that they,
uh, probably sent me something.

09:23.401 --> 09:26.269
Uh, well, my team
and I were-were, uh...

09:26.337 --> 09:28.638
Projecting sales
for the company.

09:28.706 --> 09:30.240
Uh, we d...

09:30.307 --> 09:32.308
Uh, we did a lot of research

09:32.376 --> 09:34.411
Into biofuels 'cause
we figured they'd be

09:34.478 --> 09:36.680
(computer pings)
our biggest competitor
in ten years or so.

09:36.747 --> 09:40.917
Oh. Sorry. I've just got to take
a look at this real quick.

09:40.985 --> 09:42.452
I'm listening, though.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.287
Oh, uh, uh, yes,
some of the research,

09:44.355 --> 09:46.589
Some of the reading
that I did that made me wish

09:46.657 --> 09:49.592
That I was working in the field,
so I-I, you know, I'd love to...

09:49.660 --> 09:52.362
To-to... To...

09:52.430 --> 09:54.698
Dive in with you.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.766
(car alarm chirping)

09:58.769 --> 10:02.005
(phone ringing)

10:02.073 --> 10:03.206
Hello?

10:03.274 --> 10:05.208
Oh, hey, drew.

10:05.276 --> 10:07.077
Um, no, no, it's good timing.

10:07.144 --> 10:09.079
I just got done
with the interview.

10:09.146 --> 10:11.081
(groans):
Uh, listen, I appreciate you...

10:11.148 --> 10:12.816
Appreciate you setting it up
and everything,

10:12.883 --> 10:14.818
But I don't think
it went very well.

10:14.885 --> 10:16.219
Uh...

10:17.288 --> 10:19.723
What do you mean,
the guy loved me?

10:19.790 --> 10:21.391
My god, joe, that's fantastic!

10:21.459 --> 10:23.159
When are you supposed to start?

10:23.227 --> 10:26.996
Human resources told drew I
could start whenever I'm ready.

10:27.064 --> 10:29.632
I'm not working,
so I told him I'm ready now.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.768
I guess as of tomorrow
there's gonna be

10:31.836 --> 10:33.636
Two steady paychecks
coming in the house.

10:33.704 --> 10:34.738
You "guess"?

10:34.805 --> 10:36.106
You don't sound happy.

10:36.173 --> 10:37.741
I thought
you really wanted this.

10:37.808 --> 10:40.243
No, I-I do. I do. I just...

10:40.311 --> 10:42.011
I thought I completely
screwed the interview.

10:42.079 --> 10:45.181
I thought the guy hated me,
and then they offered me the job

10:45.249 --> 10:47.183
Before I could even
drive off the property.

10:47.251 --> 10:49.686
You know what that means?
You're just that good.

10:51.255 --> 10:52.589
Honey, hold on a second.

10:52.656 --> 10:55.892
I'm not paying attention
where I'm going.

11:01.065 --> 11:02.332
Hey, al, you there?

11:02.399 --> 11:03.767
Did I lose you?

11:09.740 --> 11:12.942
(car horn honking
and tires squealing)
(gasps)

11:15.613 --> 11:18.014
Al, you all right?

11:18.082 --> 11:20.717
Um, yeah, honey.

11:25.790 --> 11:28.191
I'm fine.
Let me call you back.

11:28.259 --> 11:29.626
(phone beeps off)

12:09.834 --> 12:13.636
Admit it was you, you bastard!
Admit it was you!

12:24.048 --> 12:27.217
Man:
"I had been pursuing the libra
for ten years.

12:27.284 --> 12:31.754
"it became an obsession
that cost me my career
and my marriage.

12:31.822 --> 12:34.257
"and so, when I went
to visit john david boatner

12:34.325 --> 12:36.092
"in the hospice
where he lay dying,

12:36.160 --> 12:39.529
<i>"when he finally admitted
that he was the libra,</i>

12:39.597 --> 12:44.367
"it was, in an odd way, the most
intimate moment of my life,

12:44.435 --> 12:48.872
And, I suspect, it was the most
intimate moment of his life."

12:48.939 --> 12:52.141
Thank you.

12:53.177 --> 12:56.112
There you go.

12:56.180 --> 12:57.547
Hi.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.184
Should I make it out
to someone in particular?

13:01.252 --> 13:02.752
Actually, if you've
got a minute,

13:02.820 --> 13:04.220
Can I ask you a question?

13:04.288 --> 13:05.288
Sure.

13:05.356 --> 13:06.856
When this was
all going on,

13:06.924 --> 13:08.625
When the libra slayer

13:08.692 --> 13:10.593
Was originally
murdering young women,

13:10.661 --> 13:12.228
I'd just given birth
to my second daughter,

13:12.296 --> 13:13.663
And I was in the hospital.

13:13.731 --> 13:16.332
I really wasn't paying
much attention to the papers.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.569
Was these the sort of letters

13:19.637 --> 13:21.638
That he would send the police?

13:21.705 --> 13:23.940
He used a different code
for each murder.

13:24.975 --> 13:26.910
And what is this?

13:26.977 --> 13:28.144
That's the sign of the libra.

13:28.212 --> 13:29.545
I guess you could call it
his signature.

13:29.613 --> 13:31.180
He carved it into each one
of his victims.

13:33.784 --> 13:36.486
And is this the man that you
think was the libra slayer?

13:36.553 --> 13:40.256
I don't think john david boatner
was the libra slayer.

13:40.324 --> 13:41.724
I know it.

13:43.394 --> 13:44.460
Are you sure?

13:44.528 --> 13:45.895
Weren't there
any other suspects?

13:45.963 --> 13:46.963
I'm positive.

13:47.031 --> 13:48.765
I've written three books
on the subject,

13:48.832 --> 13:51.501
And I personally collected
reams of evidence.

13:51.568 --> 13:53.069
Plus, he told me he did it.

13:53.137 --> 13:56.072
When I went to visit him
right before he died,

13:56.140 --> 13:58.641
I told him if he didn't admit
that he was the libra slayer,

13:58.709 --> 14:00.944
Then no one would ever know
that he'd beaten the police.

14:01.011 --> 14:02.745
He told you he didn't do it.

14:05.849 --> 14:07.216
You gave him a cigarette.

14:07.284 --> 14:09.452
He told you
he was not the murderer.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.221
Look, I know you spent years
believing it was him.

14:12.289 --> 14:13.656
I can kind of understand

14:13.724 --> 14:16.426
Why you would lie about
what happened in the hospice,

14:16.493 --> 14:18.995
But I think you're wrong
about boatner.

14:19.063 --> 14:20.930
A young woman died last night.

14:20.998 --> 14:23.399
I think she was murdered
by the same person

14:23.467 --> 14:24.801
Who committed
the original libra slayings.

14:26.670 --> 14:28.838
I think he's back.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.682
Okay, let's say you're right.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.118
Let's say that
john david boatner

14:37.186 --> 14:39.954
Didn't confess on his deathbed.

14:40.022 --> 14:43.124
That doesn't necessarily mean
he wasn't the killer.

14:43.192 --> 14:45.026
I mean, in my experience

14:45.093 --> 14:47.295
Serial murder and a deep-seated
sense of honesty

14:47.362 --> 14:48.896
Rarely go hand in hand.

14:48.964 --> 14:52.333
Yeah, but there's a reason the
police never arrested boatner

14:52.401 --> 14:53.968
For the libra's killings.

14:54.036 --> 14:55.436
They never had enough evidence.

14:55.504 --> 14:57.939
I've been researching this.

14:58.006 --> 14:59.574
In fact, there's a fair amount
of evidence

14:59.641 --> 15:01.676
To suggest he wasn't the killer.

15:01.743 --> 15:03.578
They were never able
to conclusively prove

15:03.645 --> 15:05.012
That his handwriting
was a match

15:05.080 --> 15:06.714
For any
of the libra's notes.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.949
There was never
any physical evidence

15:08.016 --> 15:09.917
To tie him to any
of the crime scenes.

15:09.985 --> 15:11.619
Well, even if
all that's true--

15:11.687 --> 15:13.688
Even if john david boatner
is innocent,

15:13.755 --> 15:15.523
I don't see anything
that indicates

15:15.591 --> 15:17.825
That the libra killed
catherine tallridge.

15:17.893 --> 15:20.061
He was flamboyant,

15:20.128 --> 15:21.462
A game-player,

15:21.530 --> 15:24.465
Taunting the police
with... With cryptograms,

15:24.533 --> 15:26.867
Carving his signature into
the foreheads of his victims.

15:26.935 --> 15:27.902
He took credit.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.337
He liked taking credit.

15:29.404 --> 15:31.172
Now if you're
correct,

15:31.240 --> 15:33.074
And this man is
still walking,

15:33.141 --> 15:34.809
Still killing among us,

15:34.876 --> 15:36.644
Why didn't he take credit
for this death?

15:36.712 --> 15:38.246
No symbol was carved
in her forehead.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.749
No coded message was left
for the police to decrypt.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.819
If he killed her, wouldn't he
want the world to know?

15:44.886 --> 15:47.321
I think he wanted to.
I think he ran out of time.

15:47.389 --> 15:48.956
(ringtone playing)
a neighbor heard noises coming

15:49.024 --> 15:50.424
From inside catherine
tallridge's apartment

15:50.492 --> 15:51.759
The night that
she was murdered.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.127
She called the police.

15:53.195 --> 15:54.662
I think he had
to run out of there.

15:54.730 --> 15:56.130
He didn't have time
to sign his work.

15:56.198 --> 15:58.666
Hmm.

15:58.734 --> 16:03.404
I'm sorry, but I think you need
to, uh... Rethink your theory.

16:03.472 --> 16:04.839
That was the medical examiner.

16:04.906 --> 16:06.707
Catherine tallridge's
wounds

16:06.775 --> 16:09.777
Were inflicted by
an left-handed attacker.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.880
The libra, as I'm sure you know
from your research,

16:12.948 --> 16:13.948
Was right-handed.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.751
Allison:
I'm home.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.056
Hi.

16:22.124 --> 16:23.557
Hey, where is everybody?

16:23.625 --> 16:25.059
Homework.

16:25.127 --> 16:30.398
I picked up a fudge ripple cake
on the way home to celebrate.

16:32.134 --> 16:34.402
What's with the long face?

16:34.469 --> 16:36.070
You got a new job.

16:36.138 --> 16:37.638
Everything all right?

16:37.706 --> 16:40.608
I was just about
to ask you that.

16:40.676 --> 16:42.576
Um, this is the note
that you wrote

16:42.644 --> 16:44.378
To marie's teacher this morning.

16:44.446 --> 16:45.680
She sent it back.

16:54.256 --> 16:57.091
Car keys and
your wallet now!

16:57.159 --> 16:59.994
Come on. Give me
your wallet!

17:00.062 --> 17:02.496
Give me your wallet
right now.
Okay, okay, okay.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.464
Now your keys.
Let's go.

17:04.532 --> 17:06.000
Let's go!

17:06.068 --> 17:07.734
Man, let me...
Let me have my car.

17:07.803 --> 17:09.337
I just need to get to work,
and, you know...

17:09.404 --> 17:10.805
You don't give me those keys,

17:10.872 --> 17:13.307
You're not going to need
anything ever again.

17:19.681 --> 17:21.015
(gunshot)

17:28.457 --> 17:32.093
(car door opening and closing)

17:32.160 --> 17:34.628
(engine starting)

17:46.842 --> 17:49.710
(gasps)

17:54.883 --> 17:55.916
Hey.
Hi.

17:55.984 --> 17:57.385
You must be the new guy.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.754
Joe dubois.
Welcome aboard, joe.

17:59.821 --> 18:01.655
Brian fondran.

18:03.692 --> 18:05.493
Hey, brian, can I ask you
a question?

18:05.560 --> 18:06.494
Yeah, shoot.

18:06.561 --> 18:07.962
How do we get started here?

18:08.029 --> 18:09.964
I didn't see any kind of
staff meeting on the calendar.

18:10.031 --> 18:15.069
Yeah, uh, we don't really do
staff meetings here.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.570
Really? Well,
how do you find out

18:16.638 --> 18:17.838
What you're supposed
to be doing?

18:17.906 --> 18:19.540
How do you...?
Well, who sets the agenda?

18:19.608 --> 18:21.409
Who establishes, like,
the thresholds for projects?

18:21.476 --> 18:25.646
Well... Nobody, really.

18:25.714 --> 18:27.181
(chuckles)

18:27.249 --> 18:30.117
This job is a little more
read and react,

18:30.185 --> 18:31.652
You know what I mean?

18:31.720 --> 18:34.789
Basically,
you just wait

18:34.856 --> 18:37.725
Until keith asks you
to do something.

18:37.793 --> 18:39.693
You met keith, right?

18:39.761 --> 18:43.097
Yeah. So...

18:43.165 --> 18:46.066
I would just wait.

18:49.905 --> 18:51.806
Allison:
Neal.

18:53.875 --> 18:57.278
Allison. Hi.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.347
I'd-I'd ask you
to join me, but...

19:00.415 --> 19:01.482
Oh, no.

19:01.550 --> 19:03.684
Actually, I left my sneakers
in the car.

19:03.752 --> 19:05.352
I came to see you.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.654
Oh, thank you.

19:06.721 --> 19:08.355
I don't know
if I mentioned yesterday--

19:08.423 --> 19:10.724
I work with the district
attorney's office.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.327
Oh, uh, I know who you are.

19:13.395 --> 19:15.062
I-I watch the news.

19:15.130 --> 19:17.865
You're, um...
A professional dreamer, right?

19:17.933 --> 19:20.568
Well, I don't know
how professional I am,

19:20.635 --> 19:23.370
But I do dream
from time to time.

19:23.438 --> 19:25.306
I actually had a dream

19:25.373 --> 19:27.875
About you last night.

19:27.943 --> 19:31.245
I saw the man who shot you.
I saw his face.

19:33.248 --> 19:36.150
I don't understand.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.319
The man who shot me
was wearing a ski mask.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.720
I never even saw his face.

19:39.788 --> 19:41.222
And it was 11 years ago.

19:41.289 --> 19:42.423
Scanlon:
That's fine,
mr. Greybridge.

19:42.491 --> 19:43.858
All we need
for you to do

19:43.925 --> 19:46.961
Is to recognize
his voice.

19:47.028 --> 19:49.096
A voice id would
give us probable cause

19:49.164 --> 19:51.599
To compel a dna sample.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.367
If that matches the sample
the police found

19:53.435 --> 19:55.302
Under your fingernails
the night you were shot,

19:55.370 --> 19:57.371
Then we should have everything
we need to convict.

19:57.439 --> 20:00.174
Are you ready?

20:00.242 --> 20:02.877
Okay.

20:05.547 --> 20:09.049
Number one, please step forward
and read from the card.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.354
"you don't give me those keys,

20:13.421 --> 20:16.090
You're not going to need
anything ever again."

20:17.792 --> 20:20.561
I don't think so.

20:20.629 --> 20:22.029
Scanlon:
Thank you, number one.

20:22.097 --> 20:25.165
Number two, please step forward
and read from the card.

20:25.233 --> 20:26.934
"you don't give me those keys,

20:27.002 --> 20:29.937
You're not going to need
anything ever again."

20:30.005 --> 20:33.674
Uh, I don't know.

20:33.742 --> 20:35.509
Maybe.

20:35.577 --> 20:38.679
I'm sorry. It was...
It was a long time ago.

20:38.747 --> 20:40.114
You're doing fine.

20:40.181 --> 20:42.082
Remember, you don't have
to worry about their faces.

20:42.150 --> 20:45.319
You don't even have
to look at their faces
if you don't want to.

20:47.389 --> 20:51.258
Number three, please
step forward and read the card.

20:53.395 --> 20:55.930
"you don't give me those keys,

20:55.997 --> 20:57.798
You're not going to need
anything ever again."

21:03.271 --> 21:06.240
That's him.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.944
I'm sure of it.

21:10.011 --> 21:14.515
I don't even need
to hear anyone else.

21:14.583 --> 21:18.586
That's the man that shot me.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.754
I'm get a uniform
to start the processing.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.757
We should be able to do
the dna test this afternoon.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.025
Thanks for all your help, lee.

21:25.093 --> 21:26.427
I know how busy you've been.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.362
Easiest case I ever closed.

21:28.430 --> 21:29.830
Thank you.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.002
You okay?

21:35.070 --> 21:37.237
Yeah.

21:39.975 --> 21:42.443
Thank you, allison.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.311
(knocking)
yeah?

21:46.314 --> 21:47.314
Hi, keith.

21:49.551 --> 21:51.986
Joe. Joe dubois.

21:52.053 --> 21:53.921
You just hired me.

21:53.989 --> 21:55.723
Today's my first day--
was my first day.

21:55.790 --> 21:56.890
It's, uh, it's 5:30.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.593
Yeah, n-no problem.

21:59.661 --> 22:02.463
We'll, uh, we'll see you
tomorrow.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.764
Uh, okay.

22:03.832 --> 22:06.133
Could I ask you something?

22:06.201 --> 22:09.670
Um, I... I spent
the whole day out there,

22:09.738 --> 22:12.506
And I read the, uh,
the company handbook,

22:12.574 --> 22:15.509
And I-I did
the whole orientation.

22:15.577 --> 22:17.978
Um, but nobody actually
spoke to me about work.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.547
Nobody, uh, filled me in
on any projects,

22:20.615 --> 22:25.352
Uh, told me, you know,
to do anything.

22:25.420 --> 22:28.656
You maybe waiting for me to-to
come to you with something?

22:28.723 --> 22:30.591
Like an idea or something?

22:33.628 --> 22:35.362
No one explained it to you?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.334
Oh.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.437
Uh... This department

22:43.505 --> 22:46.874
May run a little differently
than what you're used to.

22:46.941 --> 22:47.975
Okay, that's all right.

22:48.043 --> 22:49.076
No problem. I'll adjust.

22:49.144 --> 22:50.511
Just tell me
what you need.

22:50.578 --> 22:51.979
That's the thing.

22:52.047 --> 22:54.114
I don't... I don't
really need anything.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.719
The truth is I-I prefer to be

22:58.787 --> 23:01.388
The only engineer
on my projects.

23:01.456 --> 23:04.358
Honestly, I find
it streamlines things.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.893
You know?

23:05.960 --> 23:08.395
Collaboration can
just be distracting.

23:08.463 --> 23:09.463
Right?

23:10.532 --> 23:12.099
I'm sorry,
y-you saying that-that

23:12.167 --> 23:14.268
You're never going to ask me
to do anything?

23:14.335 --> 23:16.937
Not very often, no.

23:17.005 --> 23:19.073
Why did you hire me?

23:20.942 --> 23:23.777
Uh... Corporate gives me

23:23.845 --> 23:25.479
A certain amount of money
for staffing.

23:25.547 --> 23:26.980
Uh, and you know the way

23:27.048 --> 23:28.048
That corporate budgets work.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.950
If you don't
use that money, then,

23:30.018 --> 23:32.286
Well, it goes away.

23:32.353 --> 23:33.320
But who knows?

23:33.388 --> 23:35.489
In the future,
I might need it, right?

23:35.557 --> 23:38.425
So I hire people.

23:38.493 --> 23:39.493
(chuckles softly)

23:43.164 --> 23:47.668
Yeah, I-I find that most people
don't have a problem with this.

23:47.736 --> 23:51.672
Most people actually think
it's a dream come true.

23:51.740 --> 23:54.308
So... You know, uh,

23:54.375 --> 23:59.113
Maybe if you think about this
as a kind of scholarship.

23:59.180 --> 24:03.217
You're free to spend your days
working on whatever you want.

24:03.284 --> 24:05.953
You're just not going to be
working on biodiesels.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.454
<i>Joe:
Turns out
I could've been anyone.</i>

24:07.522 --> 24:09.022
Maybe I was just
the last interview.

24:09.090 --> 24:10.791
Maybe he was just tired
of seeing people.

24:10.859 --> 24:11.959
Wait, he's just

24:12.026 --> 24:13.861
Going to pay you
to sit there and do nothing?

24:13.928 --> 24:15.629
Yeah, that's what he said.

24:15.697 --> 24:18.465
He said to think of it
as a kind of scholarship.

24:18.533 --> 24:21.135
I mean, it's not like I'm going
to turn down the money.

24:21.202 --> 24:22.536
I mean, truth is, I can't.

24:22.604 --> 24:24.638
But I don't know.

24:24.706 --> 24:27.040
I mean, I know there are
a lot of people out there

24:27.108 --> 24:29.276
Who'd kill to be, you know,
getting a paycheck right now,

24:29.344 --> 24:30.344
Any kind of paycheck.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.249
But I honestly don't know
if I can do it.

24:35.316 --> 24:39.553
I don't know if I can get up
every morning and go into work,

24:39.621 --> 24:41.789
Knowing that my being there
is of no consequence.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.824
Well, it will change
once he gets to know you,

24:43.892 --> 24:45.793
Once he sees what he has...

24:45.860 --> 24:46.960
You don't understand.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.662
He doesn't want
to know what he has.

24:48.730 --> 24:51.131
And he certainly doesn't
want to get to know me.

24:51.199 --> 24:52.566
Okay, that's enough whining.

24:52.634 --> 24:55.836
I got to get my beauty sleep,
so I can get up bright and early

24:55.904 --> 24:57.504
And go into work
and do nothing.

25:39.168 --> 25:41.402
Devalos:
"10:21: Jacinda birk
stands at her window.

25:41.470 --> 25:45.073
"she sees a view of edison park,
but cannot see me watching.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.975
"when she is asleep,
I will go to her.

25:47.042 --> 25:48.876
When she is asleep,
I will make her mine."

25:48.944 --> 25:51.246
And it goes on like that
for the remainder of the page.

25:51.313 --> 25:55.516
Took a team of experts
about ten hours to decode it.

25:55.584 --> 25:58.219
You were right
about catherine tallridge.

25:58.287 --> 26:01.022
He confesses to her murder
about five lines down.

26:01.090 --> 26:03.258
Are we sure this is authentic?

26:03.325 --> 26:05.927
Are we sure this is written
by the original libra slayer?

26:05.995 --> 26:08.129
I'm afraid we can't
be certain about that.

26:08.197 --> 26:09.998
When the libra slayer
was last active,

26:10.065 --> 26:12.767
He left coded messages
with the body of each victim.

26:12.835 --> 26:15.203
Now, each of these codes
was unique,

26:15.271 --> 26:19.340
But all of the translated
messages had a specific voice:

26:19.408 --> 26:22.210
Arrogant, derisive,
almost clinical

26:22.278 --> 26:23.511
In the recording of detail.

26:23.579 --> 26:26.214
The time of day,
the victim's full name,

26:26.282 --> 26:28.216
References
to the location.

26:28.284 --> 26:30.885
Now, this new message--
both in tone

26:30.953 --> 26:33.121
And in the complexity
of the code itself--

26:33.188 --> 26:34.455
Appears to be identical

26:34.523 --> 26:36.291
To the messages
left by the libra.

26:36.358 --> 26:39.694
It even refers to details
of the original crimes

26:39.762 --> 26:41.195
That were held back
from the press.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.563
Seems unlikely that anyone

26:42.631 --> 26:45.600
But the original killer
would know them.

26:45.668 --> 26:49.704
On the other hand, there is one
detail that doesn't line up.

26:49.772 --> 26:51.739
According to
the medical examiner,

26:51.807 --> 26:55.276
Both catherine tallridge
and jacinda birk

26:55.344 --> 26:57.111
Were murdered by
a left-handed assailant.

26:57.179 --> 26:58.913
But isn't it common knowledge?

26:58.981 --> 27:00.648
Isn't the libra slayer
right-handed?

27:00.716 --> 27:01.916
So we always believed.

27:01.984 --> 27:03.251
But this new cryptogram--

27:03.319 --> 27:05.286
It was written by somebody
who's left-handed.

27:05.354 --> 27:09.057
Whoever killed these women, if
not the original libra slayer,

27:09.124 --> 27:13.061
Then it's someone who's doing
things the exact same way,

27:13.128 --> 27:15.296
But using the other hand.

27:15.364 --> 27:17.332
(knocking)

27:18.299 --> 27:19.333
Talk to me.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.568
I was wondering
if you'd had a chance

27:21.636 --> 27:24.238
To look at the schematic
that I left for you at lunch.

27:24.305 --> 27:26.840
It's 5:30; everyone's, uh,
everyone's taking off.

27:26.908 --> 27:28.575
I just didn't want to go

27:28.643 --> 27:31.345
If you were planning
on giving me any feedback--

27:31.412 --> 27:34.815
Any reaction,
a direction of some sort.

27:34.882 --> 27:38.719
You talking about
that wiring thing?

27:38.786 --> 27:40.887
Yeah, um, that-that
wasn't something

27:40.955 --> 27:42.389
That I asked you to do.

27:42.457 --> 27:44.091
I know.

27:47.128 --> 27:49.496
I read it.

27:49.564 --> 27:50.497
It wasn't bad.

27:50.565 --> 27:51.965
Oh, really?
Do you want to sit down?

27:52.033 --> 27:54.167
Maybe we could set up a time
we could go over it?

27:54.235 --> 27:55.802
It wasn't bad.

27:55.870 --> 27:57.537
It just wasn't excellent.

27:57.605 --> 28:00.173
You know,
I mean, frankly,

28:00.241 --> 28:02.542
What was the point?

28:02.610 --> 28:05.245
N-no offense, but I-I don't
really have any use

28:05.313 --> 28:06.880
For that kind of work.

28:06.948 --> 28:10.717
I mean, like I told you, I-I can
get to excellent on my own.

28:10.785 --> 28:12.019
So...

28:12.086 --> 28:14.354
Really?

28:14.422 --> 28:16.623
I was actually thinking

28:16.691 --> 28:19.493
About that wiring problem
today at lunch.

28:19.560 --> 28:26.199
Uh... I came up with some
pretty interesting stuff.

28:26.267 --> 28:28.268
You can take a look if you want.

28:32.006 --> 28:34.007
Thank you.

28:37.478 --> 28:38.912
I meant it.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.981
It wasn't bad.

28:42.984 --> 28:45.118
You're a smart guy.

28:45.186 --> 28:48.722
Which means that you're
going to be miserable here.

28:48.790 --> 28:50.057
I'm not saying that I'm unhappy.

28:50.124 --> 28:51.158
It's just my second day.

28:51.225 --> 28:53.160
No, I-I know you're not griping.

28:53.227 --> 28:54.661
I just...

28:54.729 --> 28:56.797
I know how this is
going to play out.

28:56.864 --> 28:58.765
Most people,
they come here,

28:58.833 --> 29:02.669
They-they figure out how I like
to operate pretty quickly.

29:02.737 --> 29:05.772
You know, they-they settle in
to doing whatever.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.608
They like doing whatever.

29:08.676 --> 29:13.246
But you... Have initiative.

29:13.314 --> 29:16.049
The trouble is,
I have no use for that.

29:18.519 --> 29:22.456
Um... Uh...

29:22.523 --> 29:24.891
I'll tell you what.

29:24.959 --> 29:26.259
I'm gonna e-mail the guy

29:26.327 --> 29:29.196
That runs the, uh,
commercial aeronautics division.

29:29.263 --> 29:30.764
They got some new contracts.

29:30.832 --> 29:32.299
They're probably looking
for talent.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.634
I could offer to take
one of their worst guys

29:34.702 --> 29:35.736
In exchange for you.

29:35.803 --> 29:38.305
You're gonna trade me?

29:38.373 --> 29:40.307
Sure. Yeah.

29:40.375 --> 29:41.675
You'll like it down there.

29:41.743 --> 29:44.344
They-they do some kind of
interesting stuff with turbines.

29:51.819 --> 29:53.086
(exhales)

29:53.154 --> 29:54.688
Scanlon:
You look like you're cramming

29:54.756 --> 29:56.189
For the world's
most gruesome final.

29:56.257 --> 29:57.190
Yeah, well,

29:57.258 --> 29:58.291
The way this is going,

29:58.359 --> 30:00.160
You might as well
just hand me an "f."

30:00.228 --> 30:02.562
I hope you guys
are learning more than I am.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.464
We've got half the homicide
division pulling overtime.

30:04.532 --> 30:06.600
So far, not much
in the way of results.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.735
Uh...

30:13.174 --> 30:16.643
Your friend neal greybridge,

30:16.711 --> 30:18.412
The, uh,
assistant district attorney

30:18.479 --> 30:20.080
In charge of his case,
called me.

30:20.148 --> 30:21.915
Apparently, they scheduled
a sit-down with him.

30:21.983 --> 30:24.584
They're building a case against
the guy who shot him, so, uh,

30:24.652 --> 30:26.520
You know, they need
to go over his statement,

30:26.587 --> 30:28.588
Talk to him
about taking the stand.

30:28.656 --> 30:30.457
Only problem is
neal never showed up.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.260
I hope he's okay.

30:33.327 --> 30:34.261
I keep calling him.

30:34.328 --> 30:35.262
I know the ada

30:35.329 --> 30:36.763
Left him a couple messages.

30:36.831 --> 30:38.632
But, uh, you know this guy.

30:38.699 --> 30:40.967
I was thinking maybe
you could reach out to him.

30:41.035 --> 30:43.270
Just, uh, make sure
he isn't gonna flake out on us.

30:43.337 --> 30:44.638
<i>Hi, it's neal.</i>

30:44.705 --> 30:45.972
<i>Leave me your name and number,</i>

30:46.040 --> 30:48.041
And I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

30:48.109 --> 30:49.242
(beep)
hi, neal.

30:49.310 --> 30:50.877
This is allison dubois again.

30:50.945 --> 30:52.412
Sorry to leave you
another message.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.815
Just, uh, calling to make sure
that you check in

30:54.882 --> 30:57.083
With detective scanlon
tomorrow.

30:57.151 --> 30:59.753
Um, if you get this,
can you call me in the morning?

30:59.821 --> 31:00.821
(phone beeps)

31:00.888 --> 31:02.055
I don't understand

31:02.123 --> 31:04.057
Why this guy won't call
either one of us back.

31:04.125 --> 31:07.027
Maybe he's afraid to confront
the guy who shot him.

31:07.094 --> 31:08.295
I don't know.

31:08.362 --> 31:11.064
When the doctors told neal
that he was paralyzed,

31:11.132 --> 31:12.666
He basically just ignored them.

31:12.733 --> 31:13.834
He doesn't really strike me

31:13.901 --> 31:18.171
As the kind of guy
who's short on courage.

31:18.239 --> 31:19.573
What are you reading
so intently?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.075
I thought you didn't have to do
any work with your new job.

31:22.143 --> 31:24.911
I don't. But I did.

31:24.979 --> 31:28.014
I took your advice, and I tried
to show him what I got.

31:28.082 --> 31:29.783
Unfortunately,
when he saw it,

31:29.851 --> 31:31.384
He couldn't have
been less impressed.

31:31.452 --> 31:32.853
Hmm.
So this is my
boss's solution

31:32.920 --> 31:35.088
To a problem that I spent
the whole morning working on,

31:35.156 --> 31:37.290
And he dashed it off while
eating a tuna sandwich.

31:37.358 --> 31:39.726
Read through it four times
now, and you know what?

31:39.794 --> 31:41.294
It's better
than what I came up with.

31:41.362 --> 31:43.096
Way better.

31:43.164 --> 31:46.399
I can see why the company
puts up with this guy's quirks.

31:46.467 --> 31:49.035
You know, it's-it's a shame
that this much talent

31:49.103 --> 31:51.104
Is attached to a guy
with zero people skills.

31:51.172 --> 31:54.474
Well... It's a shame,

31:54.542 --> 31:56.476
But at least it won't be
your problem anymore.

31:56.544 --> 31:58.044
That's right
'cause I'm gonna do

31:58.112 --> 31:59.179
Some really interesting
thing with turbines.

31:59.247 --> 32:00.780
Mm...

32:00.848 --> 32:04.284
<i>Reporter:
Authorities have cracked
the coded message</i>

32:04.352 --> 32:06.286
(over radio):
That was left
with the latest victim

32:06.354 --> 32:09.122
Of the so-called libra slayer,
though apparently the note

32:09.190 --> 32:10.690
Has given them no further clues

32:10.758 --> 32:13.093
To the identity
of the murderer.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.529
And in other news, president
bill clinton today vowed

32:15.596 --> 32:16.763
To fight impeachment char...

32:28.976 --> 32:30.644
Car keys and
your wallet now!

32:31.846 --> 32:34.014
Come on.
Give me your wallet!

32:35.082 --> 32:36.483
Give me your wallet
right now.

32:36.551 --> 32:38.051
Okay, okay, okay.

32:38.119 --> 32:39.819
Now your keys.
Let's go.

32:39.887 --> 32:40.921
Let's go!

32:40.988 --> 32:42.355
Man, let me...
Let me have my car.

32:42.423 --> 32:44.357
I just need to get to work
and, you know...

32:44.425 --> 32:46.459
If you don't give me those keys,

32:46.527 --> 32:48.428
You're not going to need
anything ever again.

32:54.869 --> 32:56.202
(gunshot)

33:05.413 --> 33:07.180
(car door opening and closing)

33:07.248 --> 33:08.815
(engine starting)

33:31.457 --> 33:32.558
So wait a second.
You're telling me

33:32.625 --> 33:33.992
That guy that limped
in here the other day

33:34.060 --> 33:37.563
With the cane...
Was the libra slayer?

33:38.330 --> 33:40.431
Neal greybridge, yes, it's him.

33:40.499 --> 33:42.600
Really? 'cause that guy
can barely get around.

33:42.668 --> 33:44.068
How does it work?

33:44.136 --> 33:47.038
Does he park in a handicapped
spot before he kills someone?

33:47.106 --> 33:49.774
I'm telling you it's him, lee.
I saw it.

33:49.842 --> 33:51.976
The original killings stopped
11 years ago

33:52.044 --> 33:53.111
Right after neal got shot.

33:53.178 --> 33:54.312
They started again

33:54.380 --> 33:56.681
As soon as he was well enough
to get around.

33:56.749 --> 33:58.116
And you want to know why

33:58.183 --> 33:59.250
The killer's suddenly
left-handed?

34:00.553 --> 34:01.786
'cause he can't use
his right hand.

34:01.854 --> 34:03.655
He's got a bullet lodged
in his spine.

34:03.722 --> 34:06.457
That sure would explain
a lot of things.

34:06.525 --> 34:07.559
Like the handprint.

34:07.626 --> 34:08.826
What handprint?

34:08.893 --> 34:11.262
11 years go, the original
detectives on the case

34:11.330 --> 34:13.831
Discovered a partial handprint
on one of the letters

34:13.899 --> 34:15.333
That the libra slayer
left behind.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.268
They were sure that was
the piece of evidence

34:17.335 --> 34:18.335
That was gonna help them

34:18.404 --> 34:19.938
Put john david
boatner away.

34:20.005 --> 34:21.306
The only problem was

34:21.373 --> 34:24.342
It didn't match.
It wasn't his print.

34:25.844 --> 34:27.879
Bring neal greybridge in.
Take his print.

34:27.947 --> 34:31.248
If I'm wrong,
you'll have lost a couple hours.

34:31.317 --> 34:36.020
If I'm right... Maybe this
whole thing will be over.

34:36.088 --> 34:37.855
(clacking)

34:37.922 --> 34:39.690
Keith, you got a minute?

34:39.757 --> 34:41.458
Actually, I don't.

34:41.527 --> 34:42.860
Just one minute.

34:42.928 --> 34:45.763
Promise. I just want to talk
to you about that transfer.

34:45.831 --> 34:47.398
What about it?

34:47.466 --> 34:49.033
It's just gonna take
a couple days

34:49.101 --> 34:50.668
To get through
human resources.

34:50.735 --> 34:52.670
I know that. Thing is,
I don't want it.

34:54.672 --> 34:56.274
Really?

34:56.342 --> 34:58.309
I knew it.

34:58.377 --> 35:04.082
Suddenly, you realize the idea
of a couple years of free money

35:04.149 --> 35:05.650
Isn't so heinous, huh?

35:05.718 --> 35:08.086
Uh, no. No, actually,
it wasn't that.

35:08.153 --> 35:09.654
Uh, I read your notes.

35:09.722 --> 35:13.558
Your solution to the wiring
problem-- it's smart.

35:13.626 --> 35:15.627
Scary smart.

35:15.694 --> 35:19.263
Oh, well, that's...

35:19.331 --> 35:22.300
Okay... Thanks.

35:22.368 --> 35:23.701
You're welcome.
Thing is, I don't want

35:23.769 --> 35:25.336
To transfer away
from that kind of thinking.

35:25.404 --> 35:26.738
No good engineer would.

35:26.805 --> 35:29.707
Yeah, well, uh...

35:29.775 --> 35:33.144
This isn't really about
what you want.

35:33.212 --> 35:35.647
I'm not so sure.

35:35.714 --> 35:38.182
See, you need my help, man.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.385
You don't know it yet,
but you need my help.

35:40.452 --> 35:41.919
You're clearly brilliant.

35:41.987 --> 35:44.188
You're brilliant enough to get
away with this howard hughes act

35:44.256 --> 35:45.657
Up until now.

35:45.724 --> 35:48.092
But I guarantee you
you're gonna get caught

35:48.160 --> 35:49.994
'cause you're not doing
your best work.

35:50.062 --> 35:51.663
Nobody does their best work
in a vacuum.

35:51.730 --> 35:53.765
Now, you need someone
to bounce your ideas off,

35:53.832 --> 35:56.200
Somebody to check your thinking
against.

35:56.268 --> 35:58.269
Somebody who's smart enough
to keep pace with you

35:58.337 --> 36:00.772
And someone who's gonna call you
on your crap.

36:00.839 --> 36:02.540
I think I'm that guy.

36:02.608 --> 36:05.943
So think about it.

36:06.011 --> 36:08.379
If you agree,
call off the transfer.

36:08.447 --> 36:11.749
By the way, you're gonna want
to check your work

36:11.817 --> 36:13.951
On diagram seven, page four.

36:14.019 --> 36:16.354
I fixed it for you.

36:17.623 --> 36:18.556
(phone rings)

36:18.624 --> 36:20.091
Hello.

36:20.159 --> 36:22.026
Scanlon:
I'm in neal greybridge's
apartment right now.

36:22.094 --> 36:24.429
<i>You should see his bookshelf:
Cryptanalysis,</i>

36:24.496 --> 36:26.497
<i>The codebreakers,
pretty much everything</i>

36:26.565 --> 36:28.499
That's ever been written
on the subject of encryption.

36:28.567 --> 36:29.867
Are you bringing him in?

36:29.935 --> 36:31.202
I'm not bringing him anywhere.

36:31.270 --> 36:33.237
Not right now, anyway.
He's gone.

36:33.305 --> 36:35.807
A neighbor told me
she saw neal packing up his car

36:35.874 --> 36:37.442
And driving off in a hurry.

36:37.509 --> 36:39.310
This was the day
before yesterday.

36:39.378 --> 36:42.046
So, uh, something must have
spooked him.

36:42.114 --> 36:44.816
Oh, my god, lee,
I scared him off.

36:44.883 --> 36:46.918
I told him that I'd been
dreaming about him.

36:46.985 --> 36:48.619
I even found the man
who'd shot him.

36:48.687 --> 36:51.089
He must have figured
it was just a matter of time

36:51.156 --> 36:52.857
Before I learned the truth
about him.

36:52.925 --> 36:55.259
We should have him in custody
right now.

36:55.327 --> 36:56.994
We would have him in custody
right now

36:57.062 --> 36:58.696
If I'd just seen it sooner.

36:58.764 --> 36:59.997
We'll find him, allison.

37:00.065 --> 37:01.632
It's just a matter of time.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.401
I'm not sure we have time, lee.

37:03.469 --> 37:06.504
Neal spent the last 11 years
of his life working his way

37:06.572 --> 37:07.538
Out of a hospital bed.

37:07.606 --> 37:08.873
Getting himself strong enough

37:08.941 --> 37:10.875
To do the one thing
that he really loves.

37:10.943 --> 37:12.910
Now that he's back,
I don't think he's going

37:12.978 --> 37:14.545
To stop killing women

37:14.613 --> 37:16.347
Just because the police
know who he is.

37:16.415 --> 37:18.683
(girl gasping)

37:21.553 --> 37:23.488
(alarm clock beeping)

37:23.555 --> 37:25.189
(man grunts)

37:27.559 --> 37:28.659
(grunts)

37:30.929 --> 37:32.897
(grunts)

38:00.125 --> 38:01.726
Â¶ Â¶

38:18.377 --> 38:20.611
(gasps)

38:20.679 --> 38:21.679
You okay?

38:23.015 --> 38:24.315
Al?

38:24.383 --> 38:26.918
Wait. Shh. I got
to get this down.

38:31.857 --> 38:33.024
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

38:34.493 --> 38:37.595
I'll be waiting
by the phone.

38:37.663 --> 38:38.729
Devalos got the fax.

38:38.797 --> 38:40.498
Okay.

38:40.566 --> 38:41.799
I told him what I know.

38:41.867 --> 38:43.668
Neal greybridge is
going to leave that note

38:43.735 --> 38:45.303
At the scene of
the next murder.

38:45.370 --> 38:47.171
The police are trying
to decode it now.

38:47.239 --> 38:48.673
Oh, well,
that's good news, right?

38:48.740 --> 38:50.842
Um, in your dream,
the murder took place

38:50.909 --> 38:54.745
At 5:30 in the morning.
Now it's exactly 1:51.

38:54.813 --> 38:56.914
So that gives the police
over three and a half hours

38:56.982 --> 38:58.182
To try and break
this thing.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.484
Yeah, well, it took
the police ten hours

39:00.552 --> 39:01.686
To decode the last letter,

39:01.753 --> 39:04.055
So the girl will be dead
by then.

39:04.122 --> 39:06.824
It's right here.
It's right here in front of me.

39:06.892 --> 39:08.459
Every one of his messages
contains

39:08.527 --> 39:09.760
The name of the victim.

39:09.828 --> 39:12.597
He stalks them; he notes
their surroundings.

39:12.664 --> 39:14.365
He documents everything.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.033
If we could just read this,

39:16.101 --> 39:17.668
We would know exactly
who he's gonna kill,

39:17.736 --> 39:19.570
Exactly how he's gonna do it.

39:24.343 --> 39:25.943
Wait a minute.

39:26.011 --> 39:27.645
I know this.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.380
I know I know this.

39:29.448 --> 39:31.816
Joe:
What you doing?

39:31.884 --> 39:34.085
It's right here.

39:34.152 --> 39:36.721
I had it right here
the whole time.

39:36.788 --> 39:38.589
What are you talking about?
You had what?

39:38.657 --> 39:40.625
This.

39:47.399 --> 39:49.400
Isn't that the note
that you wrote

39:49.468 --> 39:50.635
To marie's teacher?

39:50.702 --> 39:53.971
I need a pen.

39:54.039 --> 39:55.673
Thanks.

39:55.741 --> 39:56.974
This is the answer key.

39:57.042 --> 39:59.210
"dear mrs. Cezaux..."

40:00.679 --> 40:02.146
Devalos:
The police arrested him

40:02.214 --> 40:04.515
Early this morning
in san bernardino, california.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.350
He was trying
to break into the home

40:06.418 --> 40:07.618
Of the woman
you dreamt about.

40:07.686 --> 40:10.154
As a matter of fact,
mr. Greybridge told us

40:10.222 --> 40:12.456
He was willing to make
a full confession.

40:12.524 --> 40:13.891
There's only one condition:

40:13.959 --> 40:16.193
Before he'll issue
his statement,

40:16.261 --> 40:18.429
He wants to talk to you.

40:18.497 --> 40:20.431
(door lock buzzes)

40:27.639 --> 40:30.141
When I was in rehab,

40:30.208 --> 40:31.475
They called me

40:31.543 --> 40:39.617
"a textbook example
of courage, willpower."

40:39.685 --> 40:46.390
Nobody could believe that a man
like neal greybridge--

40:46.458 --> 40:49.493
Quiet little neal greybridge--

40:49.561 --> 40:53.497
Could look a medical
impossibility in the face,

40:53.565 --> 40:57.668
And then step on its throat.

41:00.572 --> 41:01.872
Of course,
what they didn't understand

41:01.940 --> 41:04.909
Was that neal greybridge

41:04.977 --> 41:09.146
Couldn't even make it
out of his hospital bed.

41:11.717 --> 41:16.821
Hmm. It takes an incredible
sense of purpose

41:16.888 --> 41:19.757
To achieve a miracle like that.

41:19.825 --> 41:23.260
And the part
that I showed the world,

41:23.328 --> 41:30.768
The part that everybody knew
as "neal greybridge"--

41:30.836 --> 41:33.004
He didn't have that sense
of purpose.

41:33.071 --> 41:36.440
No.

41:36.508 --> 41:44.682
The man that had the strength
and the courage

41:44.750 --> 41:50.454
To... Get out of bed
and walk again...

41:52.824 --> 41:57.628
That man is a part
that I kept secret.

42:00.198 --> 42:03.734
It's a part that still had
work to do.

42:03.802 --> 42:06.504
It's a part
that had to get out of bed

42:06.571 --> 42:11.175
And had to stand again
and walk again.

42:12.611 --> 42:14.645
If you say so.

42:16.615 --> 42:18.983
Why are you telling me this?

42:19.051 --> 42:25.289
Because you are the only person

42:25.357 --> 42:27.725
That's ever actually
seen that part of me

42:27.793 --> 42:29.760
And lived.

42:35.667 --> 42:39.236
Now that you know everything
about me, I'm curious.

42:42.040 --> 42:45.342
Do you see me
the way that I see myself?

42:46.812 --> 42:49.880
I see an egoist...

42:51.683 --> 42:53.317
Self-centered, self-involved...

42:55.921 --> 42:57.588
A murderer...

42:59.191 --> 43:01.725
Cowardly murderer...

43:01.793 --> 43:03.861
A waste.

43:06.398 --> 43:08.265
Will there be
anything else?

43:09.701 --> 43:11.769
