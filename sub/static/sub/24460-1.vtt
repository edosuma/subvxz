- Hey, Bob. Have fun tonight.

02:49.511 --> 02:51.550
As always!

03:18.790 --> 03:22.953
So this is what I'm gonna say -
I'm gonna get up on the podium

03:23.086 --> 03:28.246
and I'm gonna say,
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

03:28.383 --> 03:31.716
"Tonight I'm speaking on behalf
of my friend Sydney..."

03:31.845 --> 03:35.842
And, um... Sydney, I'm really nervous.

03:35.974 --> 03:38.429
- But do you care?
- Liz?

03:38.601 --> 03:40.641
I knew I'd find you here.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.523
Sydney, how you doin', brother?

03:43.648 --> 03:47.480
I need your signature here
so I can change the polar bear's diet.

03:47.652 --> 03:51.816
It's already five. I'll check the calf.
Just go home and get ready, OK?

03:51.948 --> 03:56.444
Thanks. Bob's picking up my dress, I have
stockings, I have to take Mel for a run.

03:56.578 --> 03:59.151
My hair, make-up... God, I'm so nervous!

03:59.289 --> 04:05.042
You'll be fine. At the worst you forget your
speech and we don't get any donations.

04:05.169 --> 04:08.420
- Don't even say that.
- Just kiddin'.

04:08.548 --> 04:13.340
Oh, look at him, Charlie.
We'd go nuts in a place this small.

04:13.469 --> 04:16.470
I know. But we're workin' on it.

04:18.099 --> 04:20.555
Wish me luck, Sydney.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.844
He only does that with you.

04:27.650 --> 04:31.518
- Who are you bringing tonight?
- Haven't decided. Still got two hours.

04:49.046 --> 04:50.291
Don't shake.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.332
No, no, no, don't!

04:52.467 --> 04:55.670
Oh, wet dog.
Come on, let's do it. Wet doggie!

04:59.140 --> 05:02.224
Good boy! You hungry? Let's eat.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.939
Let's go, Mel. She'll be home any minute.

05:10.526 --> 05:13.729
Come on. Come on and eat. Let's eat.

05:14.572 --> 05:16.611
Ooh, this looks good!

05:20.911 --> 05:23.367
Go get some dinner. Come on, come on!

05:24.915 --> 05:26.908
Dinner! Come on!

05:27.126 --> 05:29.831
All right, she'll be home in a minute.

05:35.384 --> 05:38.219
- Hi, my baby!
- Hey, babe.

05:38.512 --> 05:41.383
Hey, honey! It's pouring out.

05:42.683 --> 05:46.052
- Did you get my dress?
- Yeah, picked it up from the cleaners.

05:46.395 --> 05:48.269
We're on schedule.

05:48.564 --> 05:50.770
Mel, I'm so nervous.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.145
I took Mel out.

05:52.610 --> 05:55.729
In your tux?
Honey, your pants are soaked.

05:56.864 --> 06:00.031
- Tell Mel to eat.
- Mel, eat!

06:06.749 --> 06:08.907
You are cute!

06:11.086 --> 06:14.455
Spend all day with an ape,
what do you expect?

06:22.598 --> 06:24.840
Under our care at Lincoln Park Zoo

06:24.975 --> 06:30.183
Sydney has regained his strength
and maintained excellent health.

06:35.527 --> 06:38.694
Over the years Sydney has become
a part of the family.

06:38.822 --> 06:40.649
Here he is with my husband.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.941
My husband's the one on the right.

06:45.245 --> 06:49.195
With the generous donations
we've received tonight,

06:49.416 --> 06:53.877
along with continued
fund-raising, hint hint,

06:54.004 --> 07:00.374
I hope - we hope - to expand
the gorilla habitat to triple its size.

07:02.846 --> 07:07.473
Thank you all for your tremendous
support, and enjoy the evening.

07:10.270 --> 07:13.853
Elizabeth Rueland.
Thank you, Dr Rueland.

07:13.982 --> 07:16.308
Let's hear it for the doctor.

07:16.443 --> 07:21.568
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr Joey Gian!

07:21.698 --> 07:23.406
Good evening.

07:23.784 --> 07:28.161
Speaking ofanimals, the band and I
have worked up something special.

07:28.288 --> 07:30.328
So let's get this party started.

07:43.136 --> 07:48.344
In the village, the peaceful village,
the lion sleeps tonight

07:49.518 --> 07:54.643
ln the village, the quiet village,
the lion sleeps tonight

07:55.565 --> 08:00.607
Wimoweh, wimoweh,
wimoweh, wimoweh

08:05.033 --> 08:07.904
"What do you expect most
from a relationship?"

08:08.036 --> 08:12.864
("A) Companionship,
B) Sex or C) Respect?"

08:12.999 --> 08:17.460
I'd go with B, but let's put C so we get
a higher score. What do you think?

08:17.587 --> 08:19.414
I think...

08:19.965 --> 08:24.627
What do you need? Ls it your neck?
I'll move the pillow.

08:25.345 --> 08:28.014
Your back? I can raise you up.

08:29.182 --> 08:31.175
Rosebud.

08:32.394 --> 08:37.635
Very funny. You almost gave me
a heart attack - excuse the expression.

08:38.482 --> 08:40.725
Meg, you can go home.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.696
To what? My cable's out.

08:43.822 --> 08:46.609
Joe and the kids.

08:46.741 --> 08:48.284
They're OK.

08:48.410 --> 08:52.158
It's good for him to be with them when
they're comin' down from the sugar.

08:52.289 --> 08:56.156
He usually fuels them up
and then they detox on my shift.

08:56.293 --> 08:58.866
Well, you've seen it!

08:59.629 --> 09:02.500
Promise me
you'll take care of my grandpa.

09:02.632 --> 09:04.708
What's got you talkin' like that?

09:06.428 --> 09:09.962
I may never get a heart. You know?

09:10.598 --> 09:14.050
I know you'll get one. I know.

09:14.519 --> 09:19.395
You'll be able to do things you were
never able to. Concentrate on that.

09:19.607 --> 09:22.359
Think about it, Grace.
Picture ridin' a bike.

09:22.485 --> 09:24.478
Yeah, ridin' a bike.

09:24.988 --> 09:28.985
That's what you need to think about.
Travelling, painting in Europe

09:29.117 --> 09:33.245
and dating handsome men!
It's got to happen to one of us.

09:33.371 --> 09:35.944
I'm getting a new heart, not a new ass.

09:42.589 --> 09:44.462
Bob!

09:44.591 --> 09:47.129
Bob... excuse me... Bob Rueland!

09:48.344 --> 09:52.294
Mr Bennington. I didn't see you
or I would have stopped and said hello.

09:52.432 --> 09:55.717
- Elizabeth's speech was wonderful.
- I'll go tell her that.

09:55.852 --> 09:59.980
I suppose she told you about
our sizeable donation?

10:00.815 --> 10:02.724
- My... Mrs...
- Mrs Bennington?

10:02.900 --> 10:06.815
My wife gave, you know...
strictly anonymously.

10:06.988 --> 10:09.823
Of course. Very generous.
I'll let Elizabeth know.

10:09.949 --> 10:15.987
We also gave a chunk to the rainforest.
And before I knew it, I was on a safari!

10:16.164 --> 10:19.746
Can you imagine me on safari, Bob?

10:20.334 --> 10:21.579
No, I cannot.

10:21.711 --> 10:25.329
I was. Me and the missus,
hackin' through the bush.

10:25.465 --> 10:30.376
- Charlie?
- Hey, Bob! Mr Bennington!

10:31.637 --> 10:34.888
Charlie, did you hear about
my sizeable donation?

10:35.016 --> 10:37.933
The anonymous one. Yes, I have.

10:41.773 --> 10:44.726
- She loves this song.
- Apparently.

10:44.942 --> 10:48.810
- We don't want keep you, so...
- Stay, I'm going to put on more lipstick.

10:48.946 --> 10:50.690
Is that possible?

10:52.617 --> 10:55.238
- I'll go with you.
- To the ladies' room?

10:55.369 --> 11:00.446
You got big news for Mr B, don't you?
Mr B, Charlie's got big news for you.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.741
- What news?
- What are you...?

11:02.877 --> 11:07.040
Because of that donation, they'll hang
a picture of you in the monkey house.

11:09.050 --> 11:11.007
- I'm touched.
- It's an honour.

11:11.135 --> 11:15.963
It's not official - I have to run it by
a couple of guys. I can do that right now.

11:16.098 --> 11:19.467
You two have a lot to discuss.
So why don't you just stay and...?

11:19.602 --> 11:23.469
Listen, Charlie,
would you ever consider

11:23.606 --> 11:26.607
- a mural, maybe?
- A mural.

11:31.030 --> 11:36.107
We love it there. My mother's family
is from Tuscany so it's like going home.

11:36.869 --> 11:38.529
That's so sweet.

11:38.662 --> 11:43.324
You must come out some time. Our place
is at the edge of a magnificent vineyard.

11:43.459 --> 11:46.958
Everything's at the edge of a vineyard.
It's Tuscany.

11:47.755 --> 11:50.625
- Mrs Rueland.
- Hey, stranger.

11:50.758 --> 11:53.712
Honey, you remember Celia and Tony.

11:53.844 --> 11:56.798
We were telling Elizabeth
about our place in ltaly.

11:56.931 --> 12:01.925
- We meant to go on our honeymoon.
- Sydney wouldn't have stood the flight.

12:02.061 --> 12:04.896
I promise you we'll go to ltaly - eventually.

12:05.022 --> 12:07.893
That's big.
If that's a promise, I'll take that.

12:08.025 --> 12:12.236
- Where are you vacationing this year?
- We're going to a water theme park.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.690
That'll be nice.

12:15.699 --> 12:18.025
It's a joke, Celia.

12:18.452 --> 12:24.122
I promised my wife that we'd dance
tonight, Tony, so if you'll excuse us...

12:24.249 --> 12:26.823
- Certainly.
- It was wonderful to see you both.

12:26.961 --> 12:28.289
Good night.

12:28.921 --> 12:33.417
It's a little crowded out here right now.
Let's wait for the next song.

12:33.550 --> 12:35.923
So really... how was I?

12:36.428 --> 12:41.137
You were perfect. With the backlighting
you could see right through your dress.

12:42.267 --> 12:46.016
No, you were wonderful. Really.
I'm so proud of you.

12:46.146 --> 12:51.733
Don't be too proud. Poor Sydney's
still stuck in that small space.

12:51.860 --> 12:56.273
Tell you what. If you promise you'll take
time off for a trip to ltaly with me

12:56.407 --> 13:01.531
I promise to build Sydney a new home,
with or without the rest of the funding.

13:03.038 --> 13:04.497
Deal.

13:17.135 --> 13:19.045
Come on. You can stand on my feet.

13:19.179 --> 13:22.631
Return to me

13:25.060 --> 13:28.892
Oh my dear, I'm so lonely

13:32.401 --> 13:34.856
Hurry home, hurry home

13:34.987 --> 13:40.740
Won't you please hurry
home to my heart

13:43.578 --> 13:47.161
My darling

13:48.041 --> 13:52.371
If I hurt you I'm sorry

13:54.965 --> 13:58.049
Forgive me

13:58.802 --> 14:03.594
And please say you're mine

14:04.933 --> 14:07.602
Return to me

14:08.770 --> 14:11.724
We got a female, 34, car accident.
Hit on the right side.

14:11.857 --> 14:14.941
Head trauma, unconscious
at the scene, never regained.

14:19.823 --> 14:21.780
Get Westfall into scrub.

14:21.908 --> 14:23.568
- Name?
- Any allergies?

14:23.702 --> 14:25.244
Sir? Her name.

14:26.538 --> 14:28.495
- Sir?
- Eli-Elizabeth Rueland.

14:28.623 --> 14:31.245
Sorry, sir. You can't go in.

14:31.376 --> 14:33.369
You're going to have to wait here.

14:33.503 --> 14:35.626
We're going to try to help her.

14:36.089 --> 14:40.917
Return to me

14:43.138 --> 14:48.594
Cara mia, ti amo

14:50.103 --> 14:57.066
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu

14:58.737 --> 15:03.315
Mi' amor

15:06.119 --> 15:09.073
- Andiamo. Get that while it's hot.
- I got it, Marty.

15:09.205 --> 15:14.247
- Aah, sure I'll get it myself.
- Suit yourself, baby.

15:16.421 --> 15:17.832
Where's Sophie?

15:17.964 --> 15:22.425
She got a perm today. Her scalp is
still burning. She went home early.

15:22.552 --> 15:26.253
Oh, of course she did. Why did I ask?

15:28.892 --> 15:31.596
Will you go find yourself a gondola?

15:40.028 --> 15:41.438
Pick up.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.812
Now then, Nancy darlin'...

15:45.533 --> 15:48.368
It looks massive but you'll get through it.

15:48.494 --> 15:49.693
Thank you.

15:49.829 --> 15:52.118
Marty, how is Gracie doing?

15:52.248 --> 15:56.957
Oh, fine, you know.
We... we're all waiting.

15:57.086 --> 16:00.538
- Are you still keeping up the rosary?
- Every night.

16:00.673 --> 16:04.541
- Give her our love.
- Oh, I will, of course. Of course I will.

16:07.597 --> 16:10.800
I can do that.
Where are the three chicken Vesuvios?

16:10.933 --> 16:15.595
- Already served them, Marty.
- Thank you very much. Grazie.

16:27.366 --> 16:30.451
Oh, you've got it, haven't you?

16:30.578 --> 16:34.243
You have? Thanks be to God
and all the saints in heaven!

16:34.373 --> 16:36.366
Let me talk to her.

16:36.501 --> 16:39.205
I'll be right over. Here's Angelo now.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.828
Call everybody up now!

16:41.964 --> 16:43.874
You got a heart, huh?

17:01.525 --> 17:03.898
What, like an hour into it?

17:04.028 --> 17:08.986
Someone will come out
and tell you intermittently. Excuse me.

17:09.116 --> 17:10.527
He's here.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.329
- You're here.
- Isn't she beautiful?

17:14.121 --> 17:18.036
Grandpa, thank you for
always taking care of me.

17:19.126 --> 17:22.211
And if I don't come out...

17:24.173 --> 17:26.580
I love you so much.

17:26.717 --> 17:30.549
You've got to come out.
If those tulips you planted come up

17:30.679 --> 17:35.057
and see only me standin' there,
they'll go back into the ground again.

17:35.768 --> 17:38.804
Thanks. Give me a kiss.

17:42.066 --> 17:43.690
OK, folks.

17:44.735 --> 17:47.570
- Here we go.
- Pray, Grandpa.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.607
We'll take good care of her.

17:50.741 --> 17:53.279
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

18:10.928 --> 18:12.967
I got to walk Mel.

18:14.640 --> 18:19.681
I left the hospital a few hours ago.
I came by and took him to the park.

18:19.812 --> 18:21.472
OK.

18:21.605 --> 18:23.349
Thanks.

18:36.328 --> 18:38.902
- I'm gonna stay.
- No.

18:43.419 --> 18:47.962
I'll pick your parents up
from the airport in the morning.

18:51.051 --> 18:52.629
Thanks.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.301
OK.

19:04.606 --> 19:09.102
If you need anything, you call me.
I'll be here in two minutes.

19:10.988 --> 19:13.858
Thank you, Charlie.

19:48.650 --> 19:51.188
She's not coming home, Mel.

20:56.801 --> 21:00.633
Blessed Michael the Archangel,
who protects in battle,

21:00.764 --> 21:04.215
and this is the greatest
battle of our lives...

21:04.350 --> 21:09.772
My wife never thought much of you
but you were always my favourite saint.

21:09.898 --> 21:12.649
Cos you're a battler,
you're a fighter. Well,

21:12.776 --> 21:15.527
fight for us now, Michael. Fight for us.

21:15.653 --> 21:18.857
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

21:18.990 --> 21:21.944
Adam Martin Dayton, what is that?

21:22.076 --> 21:23.452
Cherry pop.

21:23.578 --> 21:26.151
- Sophie, did you give him wine?
- Angelo...

21:26.289 --> 21:28.578
Angelo, what are you doin' to me?

21:28.708 --> 21:30.914
- It's... tranquilliser.
- Great(!)

21:31.044 --> 21:33.535
So sue me.
Now they're drunk and disorderly.

21:34.631 --> 21:37.335
Is that funny, Dad?

21:37.467 --> 21:40.503
Stop it right now, both of you. Joe!

21:41.179 --> 21:43.848
- Joe...
- What?

21:43.973 --> 21:47.888
Help me out. Take the kids
to your mom's. It's one in the morning.

21:48.019 --> 21:51.886
- Here, Emmett. Nourish yourself.
- Thank you.

21:52.023 --> 21:53.434
Could I have milk?

21:53.566 --> 21:56.982
Tyler, I want all your brothers up here.

21:59.364 --> 22:01.273
I'll only buy more.

22:01.407 --> 22:04.194
- Let's go.
- I wanna stay and see the new heart.

22:04.327 --> 22:06.865
You'll see it when it comes home.
Come on.

22:07.914 --> 22:11.532
No stopping anywhere.
You come straight back here.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.040
- I'll stop at a lap-dancing bar.
- That's funny(!)

22:14.420 --> 22:17.125
- Where's Marty?
- Dad, where's Marty?

22:17.256 --> 22:19.130
In the chapel, honey.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.246
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

24:37.813 --> 24:40.138
Want me to shuffle for you?

24:40.941 --> 24:44.725
- Want to ante a quarter?
- Yes. I do.

24:47.906 --> 24:50.991
This guy you're talkin' about,
he can't sing at all.

24:51.118 --> 24:55.661
- How come he's got such a big band?
- To drown him out.

24:55.789 --> 24:57.948
Wally, stay out of this.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.752
How many famous
Polish singers are there?

25:00.878 --> 25:02.917
I got two words for you: Bobby Vinton.

25:03.046 --> 25:06.296
Bobby Vinton?!
Bobby Vinton, Bobby Vinton!

25:07.259 --> 25:09.750
Well, what have you got?
The lrish Rovers?

25:10.429 --> 25:12.468
I got three words for you.

25:12.848 --> 25:15.303
Mr Bing Crosby.

25:15.434 --> 25:17.557
He made a lovely priest.

25:17.686 --> 25:19.725
But he beat the hell out of his kids.

25:19.855 --> 25:23.438
Doesn't mean he couldn't sing.
Sinatra beat up everybody.

25:23.567 --> 25:26.484
Frank did not.
His people did, he did not.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.154
Look at Dean Martin.

25:28.780 --> 25:31.069
The guy never hit anybody.

25:31.575 --> 25:34.280
What about Jerry?
But he was askin' for it.

25:34.411 --> 25:38.574
The point is: we got Frank,
we got Dean, we got Perry Como,

25:38.707 --> 25:40.746
Vic Damone, Bobby Darin,

25:41.001 --> 25:43.788
Mario Lanza, Luciano Pavarotti,

25:43.920 --> 25:47.336
we got Beniamino Gigli,
we got the composers!

25:47.674 --> 25:50.082
Verdi, Leoncavallo!

25:50.218 --> 25:53.385
- Millions.
- That's right. A dynasty.

25:54.806 --> 25:57.760
- I'm not bragging, but...
- You're not?

25:59.144 --> 26:01.931
You're not bragging?

26:03.773 --> 26:07.059
Christ, he goes on for a half hour.

26:10.113 --> 26:11.607
Oh, come on.

26:11.740 --> 26:16.152
- I'll take you to the doctor in my Caddy.
- No thanks, I'll take my bike.

26:16.286 --> 26:19.370
- Let him take you. Suppose it rains?
- Then I'll get wet.

26:19.497 --> 26:21.122
Then you'll be sick.

26:21.249 --> 26:24.286
Gracie, settle this:
best male singer, dead?

26:24.419 --> 26:25.419
Dean Martin.

26:25.545 --> 26:27.123
- Frank!
- Bing.

26:27.255 --> 26:29.295
Bobby Vinton!

26:32.385 --> 26:36.430
Now, go straight to your appointment,
then you go to meet Megan.

26:36.556 --> 26:39.391
If your plans change, telephone me.

26:39.517 --> 26:43.218
I may stop off at the Pussycat Club.
One of their strippers quit.

26:43.355 --> 26:47.103
Don't say strippers.
God's listening to you.

26:47.233 --> 26:49.641
It's been over a year.
You can hardly see it.

26:49.778 --> 26:53.692
Nice try, Angelo.
I just don't like all the questions.

26:53.823 --> 26:56.943
Tell everybody you're
the luckiest girl in the world.

26:57.077 --> 26:58.322
I know, Grandpa.

26:59.037 --> 27:03.746
You're beautiful - and no one's
going to notice your chest.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.251
Thanks a lot(!)

27:07.378 --> 27:11.079
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, Grace!

27:11.216 --> 27:13.255
Ride on the sidewalk, now.

27:13.384 --> 27:14.962
Leave her alone.

27:15.094 --> 27:17.217
Stop in at the church as you go by.

27:17.347 --> 27:20.348
She's thanked God enough already.

27:20.975 --> 27:23.301
You're going to be
a long while in purgatory.

27:23.436 --> 27:25.595
Really? Well, I'll be with friends.

27:28.358 --> 27:30.516
God's listening to that.

28:02.183 --> 28:03.558
All right, guys...

28:05.520 --> 28:11.060
Now, out of respect we gotta give
honourable mention to Sammy Davis Jr.

28:11.192 --> 28:14.359
He only had one eye, so...
what else can I tell ya?

28:14.487 --> 28:18.401
- He was lrish, you know.
- Are you blind? He was Jewish.

28:18.533 --> 28:21.071
Whatever. Somethin' didn't fit.

28:22.829 --> 28:24.821
This is hard for him.

28:24.956 --> 28:28.823
Everyone he's ever loved has died.
I'm all he has, he's all I have.

28:29.836 --> 28:31.662
- Morning, Grace.
- Hey, Alice.

28:31.796 --> 28:35.710
Everything's looking very good.
How are you feeling?

28:35.842 --> 28:39.791
- Good. Happy. Of course I'm happy.
- Good.

28:40.638 --> 28:45.264
- What else am I gonna be?
- Well, we all have our days.

28:48.020 --> 28:50.096
Add those to your morning meds.

28:50.231 --> 28:52.140
98.6.

28:53.901 --> 28:57.270
I don't feel like I should have "days".

28:57.863 --> 29:01.482
I should be happy
just to be alive - and I am.

29:03.744 --> 29:06.449
I'm alive cos someone else is dead.

29:07.748 --> 29:11.580
I should just shut up and be happy, right?

29:11.877 --> 29:13.040
Mm-hm.

29:13.170 --> 29:17.998
You can get dressed. See you next month.
Say hi to your grandfather.

29:19.176 --> 29:21.418
He's a great listener(!)

29:21.846 --> 29:24.515
- What, honey?
- Nothing.

29:26.559 --> 29:28.598
Tom, what the hell is goin' on?

29:28.727 --> 29:31.183
- It's not my department.
- Whose is it?

29:31.313 --> 29:34.647
- My guys worked 18 hours.
- At time and a half. I'm cryin' for ya(!)

29:34.775 --> 29:37.562
- You got the best guys here.
- I don't give a shit.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.619
I got to take a break.

29:54.044 --> 29:57.663
You're on Wabash at 3 o'clock -
new beams goin' in.

30:00.426 --> 30:02.465
Keep up.

30:06.432 --> 30:10.512
- Mail it, Grace. You'll feel better.
- I know. I want to.

30:10.644 --> 30:13.811
Every time I go to do it, l... I can't.

30:13.939 --> 30:17.106
I don't know why not. It's anonymous.

30:17.234 --> 30:22.821
It says you're grateful. I'd want to get
it if I lost someone I loved. Wouldn't you?

30:22.948 --> 30:26.198
Yeah, but... it just seems so strange.

30:28.245 --> 30:31.116
Sending a thank-you note for a heart.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.701
It seems so...

30:35.961 --> 30:38.250
...not enough.

30:39.089 --> 30:43.039
- Won't you feel worse not sending it?
- Yeah. I mean, I always have it.

30:43.177 --> 30:47.885
And it's been a year, so drop it in
and move on. I'm sure they have.

30:51.393 --> 30:53.433
Yeah.

31:07.034 --> 31:08.314
Let it go.

31:13.582 --> 31:18.623
Everybody clap for Auntie Grace.
She just mailed a very important letter.

31:28.221 --> 31:31.922
- Mom, look at the cool truck!
- Yeah. Oh, look at that.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.719
- Look at their arms.
- Yeah. Wow!

31:36.855 --> 31:39.013
OK, come on - gorillas.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.255
Karson, your pants are falling down.

32:07.385 --> 32:10.885
These are Adam's. He has your pants on.

32:11.014 --> 32:13.256
That's all right. Come on, Laura.

32:14.351 --> 32:18.680
Laura, stay in front of Mommy
all the time while we're here.

32:28.365 --> 32:30.737
Aunt Grace, are you OK?

32:32.285 --> 32:35.488
Yeah. Whatever it was, it didn't hurt.

32:37.749 --> 32:41.450
Let's try it.
See if we can get him to come over.

32:41.878 --> 32:44.167
- "H"...
- Here he comes!

32:44.631 --> 32:46.505
Look, Mom, he likes us.

32:46.633 --> 32:50.465
- Doesn't he remind you of Daddy?
- He looks bigger than Daddy.

32:54.974 --> 32:57.382
- Do you see?
- That's kinda sweet.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.979
Bob, don't go in there.
I just talked to 'em!

33:07.445 --> 33:09.604
OK, guys, here's the deal.

33:09.739 --> 33:13.819
My wife wanted this building up
years ago, so we're way behind schedule.

33:13.952 --> 33:18.115
First of all, you:
artificial trees are not planted.

33:18.248 --> 33:22.032
I'm asking for an additional 50 feet
to build aroundthe existing oaks.

33:22.168 --> 33:26.118
And I will leave plenty of room
for your godforsaken souvenir shop.

33:26.256 --> 33:31.297
If you don't approve, I'm taking my men
and it's over. I don't need the work

33:31.427 --> 33:36.255
and I'm certainly not here for the money.
I'm here because of my wife.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.182
Have you got it?

33:39.602 --> 33:41.476
Good.

33:47.110 --> 33:51.902
Thanks for yellin' and screamin'.
Now I gotta go in and clean everything up.

33:52.031 --> 33:56.029
You want to get a drink?
Somethin' to shake this off?

33:56.160 --> 33:59.078
- Come on! Let's go get a beer.
- Thanks, Charlie. No.

33:59.205 --> 34:03.452
Well, if not tonight, Friday night.
Because I got somebody for you.

34:03.584 --> 34:04.960
Charlie, no.

34:05.086 --> 34:09.214
She's got a great body:
attorney, great body, intelligent...

34:09.340 --> 34:14.049
You gotta start goin' out! She loves
animals - her cat was a patient of mine.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.135
I'm a dog person.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.590
I'm just trying to help you.

34:32.487 --> 34:36.533
- Dan, you got 'em!
- It's the first time I'm wearing 'em.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.900
- You look good.
- Feelin' good.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.574
- Need some help?
- I think I'll be OK.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.330
Look at you!

34:43.456 --> 34:46.542
- Where are you goin'?
- I don't know.

34:47.837 --> 34:51.121
Thanks. I took Mel out.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.712
Put the mail next to the phone.
On the pile.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.713
Thanks, buddy. See you later.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.475
Come on, Mel.

35:04.979 --> 35:07.018
Any calls?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.683
You have no messages.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.396
Wanna eat?

35:36.135 --> 35:38.174
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr Rueland.

35:39.221 --> 35:40.763
Hey, Mel!

35:42.308 --> 35:44.846
- There you go.
- Thanks. See you tomorrow night.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.885
- Yeah.
- Bye. Bye, Mel!

35:51.817 --> 35:53.857
Come on. In the kitchen.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.774
I got you some rice.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.535
Here we go.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.662
You're gonna eat in here today.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.374
Good.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.576
Come on. Come on.

36:13.964 --> 36:18.756
I'm not doin' this any more.
We're goin' back to eatin' in the kitchen.

36:18.886 --> 36:23.464
Goddammit, Mel, come on back here and
eat in the kitchen like a normal person!

36:37.070 --> 36:39.147
Good boy, good boy. Come on, let's go.

36:40.449 --> 36:43.865
To the kitchen. Let's go.
That's it. Follow me.

36:51.335 --> 36:53.790
There's a good boy.

36:55.005 --> 36:58.540
Good boy. You made it halfway.

37:00.719 --> 37:04.254
You gotta snap out of it, buddy.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.406
Charlie, it's Bob.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.861
I'm gonna go out with you
on Friday, all right?

37:26.995 --> 37:29.237
Yeah, you heard me.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.581
Where?

37:32.667 --> 37:35.075
O'Reilly's?

37:35.670 --> 37:38.161
O'Reilly's ltalian restaurant?

37:39.091 --> 37:40.549
OK.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.210
Where is that?

37:56.441 --> 37:58.481
Ah, Marie

37:59.194 --> 38:03.986
Ah, Marie!

38:05.158 --> 38:06.950
Big finish, Grandpa!

38:07.786 --> 38:10.656
I'm still trying to get them
to play "Danny Boy".

38:18.838 --> 38:25.007
All right, I got a chicken Vesuvio and
a corned beef and cabbage - no butter.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.928
All right, darlin'.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.297
Now... don't eat that.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.977
Oh, my God!

38:40.735 --> 38:44.151
Save it for the ltalians.
I know you love me.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.484
Can we afford it?

38:46.616 --> 38:50.696
Angelo says a true artist
must paint in the Pissa Navona.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.702
Piazza Navona!

38:55.083 --> 38:59.579
- You know, l... I could go over with you.
- Sure, yeah.

38:59.754 --> 39:04.500
- Marty, let her go alone.
- Or... you wouldn't have to go at all...

39:04.843 --> 39:07.215
- She'll be fine.
- I'm gonna go.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.177
She's never before been on an aeroplane
and Rome is far away.

39:11.307 --> 39:15.768
- She'll be fine. You paid for the ticket.
- We'll discuss it later on.

39:15.895 --> 39:20.225
- Ange. Two more, hon.
- Sophie, he gave her the ticket!

39:20.358 --> 39:22.730
You couldn't wait till I was here?

39:22.860 --> 39:26.479
She had the same look on her face then
as she has now. Show her.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.823
I miss everything!

39:29.117 --> 39:32.320
Well, the customers out there
are missing you, so...

39:32.453 --> 39:34.280
Can I at least look at it?

39:34.414 --> 39:36.074
Here, look.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.499
Don't touch it!

39:38.626 --> 39:42.494
- Look how much it cost.
- It's so beautiful!

39:42.630 --> 39:46.628
- You deserve it, sweetie.
- She does indeed.

39:46.759 --> 39:50.342
- Oh, well. All right, let's go.
- Thank you.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.263
All right, back to work.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.389
Thank you, Grandpa.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.678
Angelo, thank you!

39:57.812 --> 39:59.935
How did you talk him into it?

40:00.064 --> 40:02.982
My goodness! I'm so proud of him.

40:03.109 --> 40:06.525
He loves you so much,
he's like an ltalian mamma!

40:06.654 --> 40:09.988
I can't wait to tell Megan.
She's gonna flip out.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.903
I got another surprise for you.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.695
- He is here.
- Who's he?

40:14.871 --> 40:19.082
The guy I was telling you about.
He's at the bar, waitin' to meet you.

40:19.208 --> 40:23.704
- Oh, Angelo...
- Don't worry. I told him everything.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.503
- I told him you had your chest worked on.
- What?!

40:27.633 --> 40:30.171
- Angelo, he's gonna think I had a...
- What?

40:30.303 --> 40:31.548
Whatever.

40:31.679 --> 40:37.053
It doesn't matter. He's a terrific guy.
In fact, he had a transplant too.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.473
Coraggio - go on.

40:43.482 --> 40:46.519
My doctors -
they say it's a solid transplant.

40:47.570 --> 40:51.069
Look how natural it looks.
Go ahead, give it a tug.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.533
- No, that's OK.
- Oh, come on, give her a tug!

41:05.337 --> 41:06.880
Good evening, sir.

41:08.883 --> 41:13.046
- Are you staying or leaving or what?
- I'm staying.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.802
Thank you very much.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.645
Bob!

41:45.127 --> 41:46.870
My man, Bobby!

41:47.004 --> 41:48.664
This is Marsha.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.502
- Come on!
- I have bacon fat on my hands.

41:51.634 --> 41:57.008
It's OK. I can wash it, shower in it, swim.
Come on, give it a good pull!

41:57.139 --> 41:59.677
- I don't want to hurt you.
- It's OK! I'm fine.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.848
- OK.
- Ow, ow!

42:02.436 --> 42:04.227
- You picked a soft spot.
- Sorry.

42:08.609 --> 42:11.610
Gracie, mind the four-top
over there, will you?

42:11.820 --> 42:13.101
Yeah, I will.

42:13.238 --> 42:15.397
OK, well, it was really nice to meet you.

42:15.532 --> 42:18.367
- Good luck... with your hair.
- Thank you.

42:21.997 --> 42:25.580
Hey, Patrick. Wanna grab on
with two hands and run for the door?

42:25.709 --> 42:30.003
- No, Ralph. I don't touch men.
- It's women's hair.

42:31.256 --> 42:34.756
And then I said, "It's Squeaker, my kitty!"

42:39.681 --> 42:43.549
Everyone was laughing! Ah-ha-ha! Oh!

42:43.685 --> 42:46.520
That's when I met Charlie.
He was the only vet open.

42:46.647 --> 42:50.229
- Funny story.
- Where are the menus? What's going on?

42:50.359 --> 42:52.766
Squeaker won't let
another vet touch him.

42:52.903 --> 42:56.770
Yeah, well, I better not hear about
anybody else touching your squeaker.

43:02.746 --> 43:05.202
I didn't mean to say that.

43:05.332 --> 43:09.661
- I really like this place. It's nice.
- Oh, well, if you like this kind of place.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.630
Everything here is good.
That's the beauty of it.

43:12.756 --> 43:17.881
Oh my gosh, look at us, matchy green.
"Matchy matchy green squared!"

43:19.930 --> 43:22.088
I'll take care of that.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.381
Thank you very much.

43:25.519 --> 43:27.345
Could you hang this up behind you?

43:27.479 --> 43:29.555
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

43:29.689 --> 43:33.390
So, Rob, Charlie tells me
you work at the zoo.

43:33.527 --> 43:37.987
Wait a minute - he doesn't work there.
Bob is there building. Bob's a builder.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.688
The new building on State Street? Bob's.

43:41.618 --> 43:43.776
- You own it?
- No. No, I designed it.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.537
Oh.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.622
Good evening.

43:48.750 --> 43:52.499
No, no, no. Do you have bottled water?

43:52.796 --> 43:54.373
Sure. Anyone else?

43:54.506 --> 43:57.127
- May I have a wine list?
- Sure.

43:57.259 --> 43:59.666
Do we know each other?

44:01.346 --> 44:04.098
I think so. Have you been in here before?

44:04.224 --> 44:08.637
- I'd remember an lrish-ltalian restaurant.
- Yeah, you would.

44:09.312 --> 44:13.310
Oh, my God - blah, blah, blah. My water?

44:13.441 --> 44:17.356
I don't want Swiss water.
I got sick on that once, remember?

44:17.487 --> 44:20.654
Ach, that was awful. That was so bad.

44:20.782 --> 44:24.614
As long as it's not Swiss or tap water.
Preferably French, no bubbles.

44:24.744 --> 44:28.362
I want it cold - no ice, no glass,
just the bottle and a straw.

44:29.165 --> 44:32.202
Do you want to write it down?
I don't want Swiss water...

44:33.086 --> 44:35.873
I'm pretty sure I got it.

44:36.339 --> 44:38.332
I'm sorry. Can I get a coffee?

44:38.633 --> 44:41.124
- Sure.
- No straw.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.632
- I hate when they don't write it down.
- It will be wrong.

44:46.766 --> 44:48.474
Maybe she'll get it right.

44:48.601 --> 44:51.139
It's not gonna happen.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.098
Nope, not me.

44:53.231 --> 44:54.690
- Not me.
- No.

44:55.358 --> 44:57.516
I think your ass is ringing.

45:00.446 --> 45:02.273
I usually don't bring it.

45:02.407 --> 45:04.031
Rueland.

45:04.159 --> 45:08.026
Mike! Excuse me, I gotta take this.

45:08.162 --> 45:09.657
What do you think?

45:09.789 --> 45:12.458
Patrick, can you gimme an Aquafina?

45:19.674 --> 45:25.214
That's good, Mike. The welder can work
four days for us and one day at the zoo.

45:25.346 --> 45:28.513
Either way they get paid
under the original contract.

45:28.641 --> 45:30.219
Who else is on the clock?

45:33.896 --> 45:39.235
Um... no, no, that sounds good.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

45:39.360 --> 45:44.567
Hold on! Can you call me back in three
minutes and whatever I say, disregard it?

45:44.699 --> 45:45.778
Thanks.

45:45.908 --> 45:49.075
So the old man goes,
"How many times I gotta tell you,

45:49.203 --> 45:51.659
I don't want no brown bananas?"

45:54.000 --> 45:56.039
- Wine lists.
- That's a good one.

45:57.962 --> 46:01.331
- I bet that's refreshing.
- Such a difference!

46:01.466 --> 46:03.043
- Yes.
- There you go.

46:03.176 --> 46:04.753
It's about time.

46:04.886 --> 46:08.634
I'm doing a new food combination,
so I don't need something...

46:08.764 --> 46:12.180
- Our specials are chicken Vesuvio...
- Please!

46:12.310 --> 46:13.887
I'm around them all day.

46:17.315 --> 46:19.307
I didn't mean to...

46:19.442 --> 46:21.684
I'm a vet. You know?

46:21.819 --> 46:27.276
And a corned beef and cabbage soufflé
and a spinach ravioli, my favourite.

46:27.408 --> 46:30.243
- I'll have that.
- That sounds so fattening.

46:30.369 --> 46:34.201
- Well, just order something else.
- Is every dish here cooked in oil?

46:34.332 --> 46:37.202
No. Some we boil in Swiss water.

46:40.504 --> 46:43.256
- We're gonna need another minute.
- OK.

46:44.091 --> 46:47.875
- We should get that smartass fired.
- She's fine.

46:48.095 --> 46:51.345
No, that is not fine. That was uncalled-for.

46:53.893 --> 46:57.309
- Get out of the way, Patrick.
- We're getting compliments on the pasta.

46:57.438 --> 47:01.056
Why wouldn't we?
Angelo's the best ltalian chef in Chicago.

47:01.192 --> 47:04.525
Angelo! Three more shepherd's pies,
if you please.

47:04.653 --> 47:07.275
Oh, that's me. That's mine.

47:07.907 --> 47:09.946
Rueland. Hey, Mike.

47:10.242 --> 47:12.282
I'm just havin' dinner.

47:12.411 --> 47:15.578
No. No, that's not a problem.

47:15.706 --> 47:19.122
If I have to be there I have to be there.
See you in five minutes.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.452
- Where?
- The Wabash building.

47:21.587 --> 47:24.790
- They're working on a Friday night?
- Can you believe that?

47:24.924 --> 47:27.379
- No.
- It's an emergency. I gotta be there.

47:27.510 --> 47:30.380
- It was nice to meet you, Marla.
- Marsha.

47:30.513 --> 47:32.386
- And Shari?
- Yeah, that's it.

47:32.515 --> 47:36.678
I apologise, and... have fun.

47:37.436 --> 47:39.144
Bye.

47:45.444 --> 47:50.023
- Is everything OK?
- Oh, yeah. Fine. I just got called to work.

47:50.157 --> 47:53.324
Oh, OK. Are your girlfriend
and friends staying?

47:53.452 --> 47:58.577
God, that's not my girlfriend. It's not
even a friend. Not an acquaintance either.

47:58.707 --> 48:01.578
Yes. They will be staying.

48:03.379 --> 48:05.205
Oh. Hang on a second.

48:05.339 --> 48:09.835
- Soph, what is that?
- Ravioli and a side cabbage for pickup.

48:11.261 --> 48:13.883
Here you go, Mr... Atsuki.

48:15.474 --> 48:18.095
It's... on the house.

48:18.394 --> 48:20.137
Come back again.

48:20.479 --> 48:22.139
Thank you.

48:31.156 --> 48:33.232
Ticket, sir? Thank you, sir.

48:35.410 --> 48:39.278
Buona sera, signorina, buona sera

48:39.414 --> 48:43.364
It is time to say good night to Napoli

48:43.502 --> 48:47.202
Though it's hard for me
to whisper buona sera

48:47.339 --> 48:50.375
With that old moon above
and the Mediterranean sea

48:50.509 --> 48:53.545
- What are you doin'?
- I got a call. I gotta go.

48:53.679 --> 48:56.798
- You're already out. It's Friday night.
- I know.

48:56.932 --> 49:00.135
Drink some wine. Enjoy the evening.

49:00.269 --> 49:02.475
I can't. I gotta go to work. I'm sorry.

49:02.604 --> 49:05.273
- Thank you.
- I know you're goin' home.

49:05.399 --> 49:08.186
I'm not goin' home. I gotta go to work.

49:09.569 --> 49:11.609
Yeah, yeah, right(!)

51:04.559 --> 51:07.476
- Grace? Umbrella.
- Oh. Thanks.

51:09.564 --> 51:11.806
Another set of keys. Oh...

51:11.941 --> 51:16.603
I found this phone on the bar earlier.
Nice, huh?

51:19.073 --> 51:22.774
Buona sera, signorina

51:22.910 --> 51:27.537
Kiss me good night

51:31.878 --> 51:33.076
Bob.

51:33.212 --> 51:37.293
According to these plans...
are we only enclosing the one oak tree?

51:37.425 --> 51:41.754
No, I got a newer set of plans in my office.
We'll work Saturdays.

51:41.888 --> 51:45.672
- We are working Saturdays!
- I'll get the new set of plans.

51:45.808 --> 51:50.387
I'll take this home. My kids love
colouring between the lines on these.

51:54.442 --> 51:58.938
- Hey, Bob, could I see the new plans?
- Yeah. Sure. Right here.

52:01.783 --> 52:04.452
- These'll be the last set, right?
- Yes.

52:04.577 --> 52:05.952
Oh, yeah.

52:06.078 --> 52:08.451
Did anybody call back about my phone?

52:08.581 --> 52:10.823
Oh, yeah, the restaurant. They have it.

52:10.958 --> 52:12.998
- Who called?
- The restaurant.

52:13.127 --> 52:16.461
- No, l... who from the restaurant?
- I don't know. Some woman.

52:16.589 --> 52:19.341
- Young or old?
- I don't know!

52:19.467 --> 52:23.085
- I'll send one of the guys to go get it.
- No, I'll swing by there later.

52:26.641 --> 52:28.301
That's cute.

52:28.434 --> 52:31.352
Will you stop with the piano?

52:31.479 --> 52:33.270
I'll go in the fall.

52:33.439 --> 52:35.895
- Here's the baby pig pen.
- OK.

52:36.025 --> 52:41.861
The mommy has ten baby bottles
coming out of her tummy.

52:41.989 --> 52:43.863
That's cute.

52:43.991 --> 52:45.651
Stop with the piano!

52:46.077 --> 52:47.275
Megan!

52:47.411 --> 52:50.911
- What? I'm not playing it.
- But you...

52:51.040 --> 52:53.032
What else did you see at the zoo?

52:53.167 --> 52:57.461
Then we went to see the gorillas
and mommy said it was you.

52:57.588 --> 52:59.497
Oh, I did not! I did not!

53:00.299 --> 53:03.549
- Did she take you to see the elephants?
- Watch it, Joe!

53:03.677 --> 53:06.548
- Did you change him?
- Yeah, I'm gonna.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.136
Get up and change him.
What have you been doing?

53:09.266 --> 53:12.552
- I've been saving lives all day, honey.
- Very funny.

53:12.686 --> 53:15.604
- I'll change him.
- No, Grace, I got it.

53:15.731 --> 53:19.811
- Joe, get up and do it right now.
- I got it, Grace. I'll do it.

53:24.406 --> 53:26.280
- Megan...
- What?!

53:26.408 --> 53:29.362
I invited Rudy over. To meet Grace.

53:31.121 --> 53:32.580
Father Rudy?

53:32.706 --> 53:34.616
He's not a priest any more.

53:34.792 --> 53:37.995
To me he always will be.
Joe, she'll meet someone on her own.

53:38.128 --> 53:40.798
Where? She's here
on every one of her nights off.

53:41.131 --> 53:44.796
- He's a nice guy.
- It doesn't matter!

53:44.927 --> 53:47.762
It's not easy to dance
when no one's leading.

53:47.888 --> 53:50.723
Now help me clean up the puzzle!

53:50.849 --> 53:53.423
- Here's the barn. Barn's gone!
- What's goin' on?

53:53.560 --> 53:58.187
Nothing. Joe invited somebody over -
like a blind date for you.

53:58.315 --> 53:59.809
- What?!
- It's not a date.

53:59.942 --> 54:03.108
He's comin' over for dinner, that's it.

54:03.237 --> 54:05.313
- I gotta find my scarf.
- Better hurry!

54:05.447 --> 54:08.021
- I already told him you've had work done.
- What?!

54:08.158 --> 54:09.652
She's not a Buick.

54:09.785 --> 54:13.652
He understands, he's OK with it.
He's a priest!

54:14.123 --> 54:15.665
- A priest?
- Yup.

54:15.833 --> 54:20.660
An ex-priest. What's the big deal?
He's never dated, you've never dated.

54:20.796 --> 54:23.880
- Grace has dated.
- Who? Chooch Patucci?

54:24.007 --> 54:26.296
- I never dated Chooch!
- That's a date?

54:26.426 --> 54:29.214
You dated Chooch Patucci?!

54:29.346 --> 54:31.386
Don't say that name in this house.

54:31.515 --> 54:34.848
- It's all right, Megan.
- Do you hate priests, Aunt Grace?

54:34.977 --> 54:38.725
- No, honey.
- Cos if you do you'll go straight to hell.

54:38.856 --> 54:40.136
Your mouth!

54:40.274 --> 54:44.982
- That's great, Joe. You taught him "hell".
- I did not. You picked it up from Mom.

54:45.112 --> 54:48.481
- I never said "hell", you son of a bitch.
- Just back off.

54:49.199 --> 54:51.868
Oh, shit! Father Rudy's here.

54:52.953 --> 54:56.737
- Don't say "shit" in front of the priest.
- Shit! Shit!

54:56.873 --> 55:01.167
Would everyone just calm down,
for the love of God and all that is holy?

55:01.295 --> 55:03.204
Calm the hell down!

55:03.839 --> 55:05.878
Stop playing that.

55:12.305 --> 55:14.879
- Shut that thing off.
- No, no... Dad...!

55:15.267 --> 55:16.975
Good night, Nurse!

55:17.310 --> 55:20.015
For Christ's sake, he's just a man!

55:24.151 --> 55:27.068
I'm not used to being without it yet, Joe.

55:29.948 --> 55:31.407
Come on in.

55:32.701 --> 55:34.859
- There she is.
- Oh, boy!

55:34.995 --> 55:36.370
Dinner, I mean.

55:36.496 --> 55:37.777
Hallelujah!

55:47.299 --> 55:49.920
I'll call my friend and see where he's at.

56:00.854 --> 56:01.968
Bobby!

56:02.647 --> 56:04.106
Where you at?

56:07.235 --> 56:11.280
You ran away last night,
you don't show up tonight...

56:11.406 --> 56:14.857
I'm sorry, Charlie,
I'm just not feelin' up to it.

56:15.535 --> 56:18.406
I don't know, maybe somethin' I ate.

56:18.538 --> 56:23.615
I'm just going to... I'm gonna kick back,
take it easy, maybe go to bed early.

56:23.752 --> 56:26.871
- What you doin'?
- Now? Watching the Cubs game.

56:27.005 --> 56:30.041
- What's the score?
- The score? Oh, it's, uh...

56:32.052 --> 56:33.961
Uh...

56:34.095 --> 56:37.298
It's... the Cubs are losin'.

56:42.145 --> 56:43.425
Mr Rueland?

56:44.063 --> 56:45.143
Dan the man!

56:45.273 --> 56:47.598
Bob the slob - just kidding.

56:47.734 --> 56:50.521
Maybe you could clean up the place.

56:51.321 --> 56:53.444
I don't think you could afford me.

56:55.325 --> 56:57.033
How do I look?

56:57.452 --> 56:58.566
Tall.

56:59.162 --> 57:00.407
Tall.

57:00.747 --> 57:02.407
Tall, yeah.

57:05.084 --> 57:07.042
Thanks.

57:10.924 --> 57:15.799
Oh, Megan, it was fine.
You know... He was a nice guy.

57:16.304 --> 57:19.755
- Well, at least we had a few laughs.
- Yeah, we did.

57:19.891 --> 57:24.600
Did you notice how he was afraid
to even let me lift a plate of potatoes?

57:24.729 --> 57:27.398
No, I think he was just being polite.

57:29.567 --> 57:30.942
Mm-hm.

57:35.531 --> 57:39.529
No, but it's like as soon as they know,
they think of me as broken.

57:39.660 --> 57:44.239
I think they see you as a kind, loving
woman that's beaten unbeatable odds.

57:44.373 --> 57:46.995
- That's the way I see you.
- Urrgghh!

57:47.752 --> 57:49.709
OK, Tyler, come on!

57:50.755 --> 57:54.883
The right guy will know. Trust me.

57:55.009 --> 57:59.054
Can't have Joe helping. The way he
describes your surgery'd scare anyone!

57:59.180 --> 58:01.219
Tonight. They're asleep. We can do it!

58:01.349 --> 58:02.547
What did he say?

58:02.683 --> 58:06.432
He's saying he's sorry about tonight,
so please forgive him.

58:06.562 --> 58:09.018
Left. Step up. Good boy.

58:10.316 --> 58:11.596
Daddy!

58:11.734 --> 58:13.774
- Goddammit!
- Oh, dear.

58:13.903 --> 58:16.310
- Goddammit!
- Megan!

58:17.365 --> 58:19.903
I'm right here. Take it easy.

58:20.034 --> 58:22.276
- Dad, I want some water.
- You can't have water.

58:22.411 --> 58:25.496
- He can have water.
- He'll wet the bed and who'll change it?

58:25.623 --> 58:29.241
- I do, damn it.
- OK, potty mouth's gonna change it.

58:29.377 --> 58:32.746
Come on, honey, get up there.
You're going to sleep - for ever!

58:32.880 --> 58:37.589
- Stop, it'll be in their heads all night.
- I'll put something in their heads!

58:39.345 --> 58:42.714
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to put Mom to bed too.

58:45.768 --> 58:50.513
- Grandpa, you need some help?
- No darlin', not at all.

58:50.981 --> 58:53.021
I'm blessed with work.

58:54.151 --> 58:57.401
- Sweet dreams, Gracie Alana.
- Good night, Grandpa.

59:16.757 --> 59:18.666
Best female singer.

59:19.260 --> 59:21.929
- Dead or alive?
- Either.

59:22.680 --> 59:25.135
- Ella Fitzgerald, easy.
- Now I can agree with that.

59:26.267 --> 59:28.224
I agree.

59:28.352 --> 59:31.187
- I still take Banks over Cobb.
- Don't be ridiculous.

59:31.313 --> 59:34.231
You can't mix your dream team
from different eras.

59:34.358 --> 59:38.142
- Is this a new rule?
- You can't mix living and dead players.

59:42.908 --> 59:46.028
Ty Cobb was the greatest ball player ever.

59:46.161 --> 59:50.788
- A great player, but an animal.
- I'd still take Ernie Banks over Ty Cobb.

59:50.916 --> 59:53.703
Know how many came to his funeral?

59:53.836 --> 59:57.002
Joe DiMaggio was
the classiest of them all.

59:58.382 --> 01:00:03.507
Apples and oranges - come on, guys.
Compare short stop to short stop.

01:00:06.056 --> 01:00:10.385
You are either very late
or very early. What's your view of it?

01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:14.386
I left my cellphone here.
Somebody called back. A young lady?

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:18.223
- I'll look for it. Come in and have a beer.
- No, thanks.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.776
- Have to get home to the wife, do you?
- No.

01:00:22.906 --> 01:00:27.485
- You're... you're not married, then?
- Mmm... No. Not really.

01:00:27.619 --> 01:00:29.826
I hope she didn't walk out on you.

01:00:29.955 --> 01:00:32.327
No. No, no, she passed away.

01:00:32.457 --> 01:00:36.289
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, that's very sad.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.827
Oh, I hate to hear that. But anyway...

01:00:38.964 --> 01:00:42.796
Come on in, we'll have a pint on that.
Meet the lads back here.

01:00:44.344 --> 01:00:46.966
Now, this is my friend, uh...

01:00:47.889 --> 01:00:51.638
- Bob.
- Bob. His wife is dead.

01:00:51.768 --> 01:00:54.306
Hey, Robert! How are ya?

01:00:55.147 --> 01:00:59.856
That's Wally over there, and this is
Emmett. This is my brother-in-law Angelo.

01:00:59.985 --> 01:01:04.647
And I'm Marty. So deal him in.
Sit down and I'll get you a beer.

01:01:04.781 --> 01:01:06.904
Give him a chair, come on!

01:01:08.744 --> 01:01:13.073
- Sophie, bring another pitcher of beer.
- I'm not real good at cards, but...

01:01:13.206 --> 01:01:14.404
- You got cash?
- Yeah.

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:18.705
- You're in.
- Pay a nickel, take your chances.

01:01:18.837 --> 01:01:21.209
Well, I'm on my way home.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.710
- Ah. Hi there.
- Oh. Hi.

01:01:25.427 --> 01:01:27.633
- How'd you end up in their net?
- Sophie...

01:01:27.762 --> 01:01:29.755
His wife is dead.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:31.929
Ah. Welcome.

01:01:32.517 --> 01:01:34.177
Who's walkin' me?

01:01:34.311 --> 01:01:38.011
You're two doors down.
What's gonna happen? Will you get lost?

01:01:38.148 --> 01:01:40.603
I hope I do so you have to
live with the guilt.

01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:45.312
- Oh, yap, yap, yap...
- Oh, Sophie, I'll walk you myself!

01:01:45.447 --> 01:01:47.570
Don't pay any attention to them.

01:01:48.241 --> 01:01:50.613
- Wally, Wally.
- You got a lot of class(!)

01:01:50.744 --> 01:01:53.698
You should have walked her home.
She's sweet on you.

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:55.324
Sweet on me?!

01:01:55.457 --> 01:01:59.371
- You should have taken her home.
- What?! I've known her 20 years.

01:01:59.502 --> 01:02:02.076
- Wally Casanova.
- You think she really likes me?

01:02:02.213 --> 01:02:03.838
Casanovinsky.

01:02:03.965 --> 01:02:06.005
I think she likes you.

01:02:06.134 --> 01:02:08.376
- You do?
- She was makin' a move.

01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:12.841
- You got that impression?
- I got that vibe.

01:02:12.974 --> 01:02:17.019
- Why do you think she wants you to...
- Now here's a guy with a little taste.

01:02:17.145 --> 01:02:20.016
I can't depend on you two... hobos.

01:02:20.148 --> 01:02:22.769
So everybody's gone for the night?

01:02:22.901 --> 01:02:27.313
The bartender, bus boys, waiters,
waitresses? You're closed up?

01:02:27.447 --> 01:02:29.523
Yeah.

01:03:15.703 --> 01:03:19.368
I'm not much of a player but...
Willie Mays.

01:03:19.499 --> 01:03:23.117
And I believe all these picture cards
are a good thing.

01:03:23.252 --> 01:03:26.040
- Oh, Jesus!
- Gimme a break!

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.963
This is your lucky night tonight.

01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:39.800
- I gotta go cover my plants.
- Wait, wait, wait, Gracie.

01:03:41.229 --> 01:03:44.064
Robert, my granddaughter Gracie.
Isn't she lovely?

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:48.852
Yes, she is. We spoke last night.
I was here with

01:03:50.404 --> 01:03:53.192
- the water lady.
- Mm-hm, yes. Yes.

01:03:53.324 --> 01:03:56.610
- Nice to see you again, Robert.
- Bob. Bob's fine.

01:04:01.415 --> 01:04:05.413
I'm here because I left my phone
and you called back, and...

01:04:05.545 --> 01:04:10.206
Oh, yes! I have your pyjamas...
phone behind the bar.

01:04:10.341 --> 01:04:13.959
I'll get it. Go ahead, cover the plants.
Roberto, give her a hand.

01:04:14.095 --> 01:04:16.087
- You need a hand?
- No.

01:04:16.222 --> 01:04:17.420
Yeah!

01:04:17.556 --> 01:04:19.596
Should I go?

01:04:21.185 --> 01:04:23.012
Yes, yes, go with her.

01:04:23.145 --> 01:04:25.387
Yeah, that's very nice.

01:04:26.065 --> 01:04:27.476
There they go.

01:04:27.608 --> 01:04:29.186
All right!

01:04:29.318 --> 01:04:32.818
- I'm gonna play from the hot corner!
- Always looking for the edge.

01:04:32.947 --> 01:04:35.817
- Marty, what do you wanna play?
- Texas Hold'em.

01:04:42.415 --> 01:04:44.288
These are really fragile.

01:04:46.293 --> 01:04:48.535
- What?
- Nothin'.

01:04:48.838 --> 01:04:53.334
- I know I look ridiculous.
- Oh, no, no. It's a lovely... hat.

01:04:53.717 --> 01:04:57.169
I'd take it off,
but then I'd have a shower cap head.

01:04:57.304 --> 01:05:00.389
You saw my hair last night.
Not that you were lookin', but I mean...

01:05:00.516 --> 01:05:04.893
We did speak, so maybe you noticed
my head. My hair. My head of hair.

01:05:07.982 --> 01:05:09.227
Thank you.

01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:11.766
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

01:05:11.944 --> 01:05:14.861
You bought me dinner last night.
Very good, by the way.

01:05:15.197 --> 01:05:16.941
Good.

01:05:20.244 --> 01:05:22.533
Did you plant all this?

01:05:22.663 --> 01:05:26.874
Yeah. There's no rhyme or reason to it.
You just let it grow.

01:05:27.001 --> 01:05:31.995
It's amazing. I've never seen anything
like it right in the middle of the city.

01:05:32.131 --> 01:05:33.791
It's like a garden.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:42.264
- I might have bent that one.
- Oh. That's OK.

01:05:43.308 --> 01:05:46.475
- I gotta get some more shelves.
- Oh, you smell great.

01:05:47.146 --> 01:05:49.019
It's the flowers.

01:05:49.148 --> 01:05:53.311
Not this particular flower, cos this is
a tomato plant - it's all the flowers.

01:05:54.111 --> 01:05:56.317
You can just put that down there.

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:11.409
- Did you paint that?
- Uh, yeah.

01:06:12.504 --> 01:06:14.497
Where is this? Europe?

01:06:14.673 --> 01:06:16.879
- Could be.
- How many times have you been?

01:06:17.259 --> 01:06:19.964
Oh God, none.
I've never been anywhere but here.

01:06:20.596 --> 01:06:22.754
It's beautiful, wherever it is.

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.430
I should take it inside.

01:06:27.811 --> 01:06:30.136
I guess I paint places from my dreams.

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:33.896
I bet you can't wait to go to sleep!

01:06:38.739 --> 01:06:41.027
Would you go out with me?

01:06:41.158 --> 01:06:42.486
Yes?

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.445
- Is that a question?
- No, it's a yes. Yes!

01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:48.948
- Tomorrow night?
- Yes.

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:51.541
- Eight o'clock?
- Yes.

01:06:52.252 --> 01:06:54.292
- Pick you up here?
- Yes.

01:06:55.172 --> 01:06:57.211
My, you're a very difficult woman!

01:07:00.052 --> 01:07:02.673
You take that inside. I'll finish up here.

01:07:02.804 --> 01:07:04.464
I'll find your phone.

01:07:11.271 --> 01:07:13.844
They're coming back.
Come on, let's get lost.

01:07:13.982 --> 01:07:17.932
What? This is the best hand I ever had!

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:22.566
- Don't argue about it.
- New shuffle if we relocate.

01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.818
Emmett, come on.

01:07:31.666 --> 01:07:34.371
Get in there, come on.
I can't close the doors.

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:43.670
Grandpa?

01:07:43.803 --> 01:07:45.713
We're not here!

01:07:51.561 --> 01:07:53.969
- Who is it?
- It's me.

01:07:54.898 --> 01:07:56.772
- Who?
- It's Grace.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.779
I met someone. I just wanted to tell you.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.861
I gotta go, cos Grandpa
doesn't know I snuck out. OK.

01:08:11.623 --> 01:08:15.206
- Do you want me to drive you?
- No. I have my bike.

01:08:16.711 --> 01:08:20.625
She's not the first woman I've noticed
as a guy, but as a man...

01:08:26.679 --> 01:08:28.090
You know what I mean.

01:08:38.191 --> 01:08:40.397
I'm buildin' you a great place.

01:08:49.661 --> 01:08:54.406
I don't know what to wear.
Do you think black is too za-za-zing?

01:08:54.874 --> 01:08:58.492
I'd wear somethin' light.
Whatever you wear, just be comfortable.

01:08:58.627 --> 01:09:00.703
I have a ten-inch scar down my chest.

01:09:01.089 --> 01:09:03.959
If I was gonna be comfortable
I'd wear my sweats.

01:09:04.091 --> 01:09:07.674
Not a good idea. But whatever you do,
don't shave your legs.

01:09:08.304 --> 01:09:12.053
- Why?
- Then you definitely won't let it go too far.

01:09:12.183 --> 01:09:14.720
Megan, it's a first date.

01:09:14.935 --> 01:09:18.139
I married a first date, missy.
You know how it is.

01:09:18.272 --> 01:09:23.184
You're with a guy, you find him attractive,
everything they say sounds brilliant.

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:25.276
Hairy legs are your link to reality.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.439
Needlepoint that on a pillow.

01:09:27.573 --> 01:09:32.116
I just might.
It kept me a virgin until - you know...

01:09:32.245 --> 01:09:34.283
- Whenever.
- Bye.

01:09:37.959 --> 01:09:41.209
I fly to Florida a couple of times a year
to visit the folks.

01:09:41.337 --> 01:09:44.671
- I can't wait to go on a plane.
- You've never been on a plane?

01:09:44.799 --> 01:09:46.837
- Well, no, I couldn't.
- How come?

01:09:46.968 --> 01:09:48.925
Since I was 14 I've...

01:09:50.136 --> 01:09:52.344
My grandpa was sick.

01:09:52.473 --> 01:09:56.518
I always had to stay close to home
so I could take care of him.

01:09:56.644 --> 01:09:58.518
God, he seems so healthy now.

01:09:58.646 --> 01:10:03.272
Well, he is. Now he's fine.
He doesn't even like to talk about it.

01:10:03.401 --> 01:10:05.144
Ever.

01:10:05.278 --> 01:10:08.860
I'll remember that.
What about your parents?

01:10:09.448 --> 01:10:11.737
My mom died when I was five.

01:10:11.867 --> 01:10:14.109
I'm sorry. How?

01:10:14.245 --> 01:10:15.704
Heart disease.

01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:21.248
My dad took off as soon as her illness
interfered with his plans.

01:10:22.628 --> 01:10:24.668
It was all right. You know...

01:10:25.798 --> 01:10:29.843
Grandpa was always the one
that'd take care of us anyway.

01:10:35.641 --> 01:10:36.970
What'll you have?

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.683
- Can I get two scoops?
- No.

01:10:39.812 --> 01:10:41.306
Of course you can!

01:10:50.197 --> 01:10:51.526
Watch your head.

01:11:01.959 --> 01:11:04.876
This is the first job
I supervised on my own.

01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:07.330
I love this building.

01:11:09.091 --> 01:11:10.372
Wow!

01:11:11.886 --> 01:11:13.510
That's incredible.

01:11:14.013 --> 01:11:17.631
We see all this cos we're
standing on something you built.

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:20.970
I had help.

01:11:23.564 --> 01:11:25.141
Thanks.

01:11:30.529 --> 01:11:33.980
Elizabeth and I were married
by the time we were 20.

01:11:34.116 --> 01:11:42.076
We'd been dating since we were 15,
so this may sound a bit juvenile... but...

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:45.163
Can I hold your hand?

01:11:45.711 --> 01:11:47.086
Yes.

01:12:09.109 --> 01:12:13.605
- Sometimes it feels like another life.
- I know what you mean.

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:18.906
Thanks for... coming out.
I had a really nice time tonight.

01:12:19.036 --> 01:12:21.491
Yeah. So did l.

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:24.449
- I should give you this.
- No.

01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:28.742
Keep it. I'll get it back from you
next time we go out.

01:12:29.171 --> 01:12:31.626
- OK.
- It looks good with your blouse anyway.

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:33.917
Oh, God!

01:12:35.886 --> 01:12:37.925
I'm so sorry.

01:12:38.889 --> 01:12:42.554
- My God, did you see anything?
- I wasn't looking.

01:12:42.684 --> 01:12:45.555
No, I know. It's because I had a heart...

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.727
I had a heart...
a heart-warming dream about you.

01:12:50.859 --> 01:12:54.310
- Must have been a nightmare.
- No, you were very...

01:12:54.821 --> 01:12:56.814
- Scary?
- Sexy.

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.695
- You had a sex dream about me?
- No, I didn't...

01:12:59.826 --> 01:13:03.776
I didn't have a sex dream about you.
I don't even know you.

01:13:03.955 --> 01:13:05.498
I'm really sorry.

01:13:09.044 --> 01:13:10.455
Good night.

01:13:19.721 --> 01:13:21.761
Good night.

01:13:25.936 --> 01:13:27.845
Morning, Dennis. Boys.

01:13:27.979 --> 01:13:30.766
Good mornin' life, good mornin' sun...

01:13:30.899 --> 01:13:32.559
Tommy!

01:13:32.692 --> 01:13:36.357
Gee, it's great to be alive and in love

01:13:38.073 --> 01:13:40.445
Good mornin' life

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:44.451
Good mornin' birds,
sing out, you're happy too

01:13:44.579 --> 01:13:47.153
Feel so good, cos I'll be seein' her soon

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:48.950
Boys, you comin'?

01:13:49.751 --> 01:13:53.416
Last night she said she loved me

01:13:53.546 --> 01:13:55.420
What a pity to part

01:13:59.719 --> 01:14:01.712
Hey, it's the new hip!

01:14:02.055 --> 01:14:04.628
I wish I could move like that, Wally.

01:14:07.769 --> 01:14:11.102
Gee, Wally, which ball is yours?

01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:14.558
- Oh, you shutta your trap!
- I didn't say anythin'.

01:14:14.734 --> 01:14:16.774
Here goes, boys!

01:14:21.699 --> 01:14:23.443
He strikes! Yes!

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:28.699
Megan, it's you.

01:14:31.417 --> 01:14:33.457
Hey, get up there, Megan.

01:14:34.754 --> 01:14:36.877
Megan, how do I look?

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.790
- Great. I've never seen you so happy.
- I am so hot!

01:14:40.927 --> 01:14:43.465
What do you expect in a wool sweater?

01:14:43.596 --> 01:14:45.256
- It's cotton.
- Go in your lane.

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:47.963
- It's up to here! Just tell him.
- I'm gonna.

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:49.513
Where's your ball?

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:50.931
Here we go.

01:14:56.734 --> 01:14:59.439
All right! Very good!

01:15:00.238 --> 01:15:03.773
I got you some hot chocolate.
I thought you might be cold.

01:15:04.325 --> 01:15:05.523
Thanks.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:11.369
All at once I knew what livin' can be

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:15.625
Do you suppose we could
get back to the game?

01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.664
- I'll hold on to it. I'll be right here.
- All right.

01:15:19.799 --> 01:15:21.708
I'll just... bowl.

01:15:21.843 --> 01:15:25.212
Good mornin' life

01:15:27.598 --> 01:15:30.172
Can I get a Miller? Bottle, no glass.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.064
Oh, my God!

01:15:45.158 --> 01:15:46.700
I'll be a minute.

01:15:47.618 --> 01:15:49.527
Angelo!

01:15:49.662 --> 01:15:54.490
- All right, make way!
- Come on, killer!

01:15:56.168 --> 01:15:58.410
Charlie! You made it.

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:00.463
Thanks for comin'.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.504
- I, uh... thought we were meeting at a bar.
- There's a bar here.

01:16:04.635 --> 01:16:08.680
- What's with the senior citizens?
- We're bowlin'. It's good.

01:16:08.806 --> 01:16:11.558
- Everybody, this is Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

01:16:11.684 --> 01:16:14.353
Joe, Charlie.
This is a good friend of mine.

01:16:14.478 --> 01:16:16.270
Emmett, my good friend Charlie.

01:16:16.397 --> 01:16:19.433
- Charlie, you in?
- Yeah, he's in. Ten spot.

01:16:21.527 --> 01:16:24.279
- You for or against?
- Uh... for.

01:16:24.405 --> 01:16:27.489
For? For? For? Of course.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.404
- What did I just bet on?
- Whether Angelo gets a strike or not.

01:16:35.374 --> 01:16:37.616
All right!

01:16:37.752 --> 01:16:41.998
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
You're right here!

01:16:42.173 --> 01:16:43.418
All right!

01:16:43.549 --> 01:16:45.043
- Did I win?
- Yeah.

01:16:45.176 --> 01:16:46.884
- Great!
- Everybody won.

01:16:47.011 --> 01:16:51.091
- Here we go.
- You're lookin' at your highest score ever.

01:16:51.223 --> 01:16:54.224
Which is 67 up to now, Emmett.

01:16:54.393 --> 01:16:57.596
- I didn't even know Bob bowled.
- He doesn't.

01:16:58.397 --> 01:17:00.970
I would like to dedicate
this next shot to Grace,

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:05.527
who brought me back to the game
after a 25-year absence.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.691
Before I was
your beer-runner and milkman,

01:17:08.866 --> 01:17:10.989
the last time I bowled was

01:17:11.118 --> 01:17:14.783
Andy Jankovsky's 13th birthday party.

01:17:14.955 --> 01:17:16.153
So Grace,

01:17:16.916 --> 01:17:19.323
this shot's for you.

01:17:22.087 --> 01:17:26.085
68! 68!

01:17:28.636 --> 01:17:30.509
Aaw! It's still

01:17:30.637 --> 01:17:33.045
- 66! 66!
- Hey, Bob!

01:17:33.223 --> 01:17:36.260
- Try the other arm.
- I got one more.

01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:38.765
- So what do you do?
- I'm a vet.

01:17:38.896 --> 01:17:41.054
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't go to 'Nam.

01:17:52.743 --> 01:17:55.150
That's for you, baby.

01:17:56.497 --> 01:18:00.245
I think Sammy Davis Jr is
the greatest performer of that group.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.045
- And I like Bill Cosby too.
- Well, l...

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:05.328
Oh, oh, oh. And Flip Wilson.

01:18:05.464 --> 01:18:07.124
Oh, yeah!

01:18:07.257 --> 01:18:08.538
What a wacko.

01:18:08.675 --> 01:18:12.009
- This'll be good for about a week.
- Thank you so much.

01:18:12.804 --> 01:18:15.011
I really appreciate it.
See you guys later.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.343
- Bye, Emmett. Bye, guys!
- Bye-bye, Charlie!

01:18:18.477 --> 01:18:20.019
Poker tonight?

01:18:20.145 --> 01:18:24.095
No, Grace and I are going to enjoy
a glass of wine, maybe take a walk...

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:26.521
So I'll let you boys
hold on to your money.

01:18:26.652 --> 01:18:30.270
Don't walk too far now.
It's getting very dark out there.

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:33.940
How would you like to take a spin
in my Cadillac? I just had it waxed.

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:37.492
I can't handle that machine.
It's too much for me. But thank you.

01:18:37.621 --> 01:18:39.578
- You need a sweater?
- Yes, she does.

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:42.953
I don't need a sweater, OK?

01:18:43.126 --> 01:18:46.293
You don't need to go far
beyond the yard anyway.

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:51.416
I'm going to have to put the special
candle out there that repels all the bugs.

01:18:51.551 --> 01:18:53.627
Every species but one!

01:18:56.139 --> 01:18:58.096
Marty, what species is that?

01:18:58.225 --> 01:19:00.894
It's the sabre-tooth fly.

01:19:07.526 --> 01:19:09.565
- The famous candle.
- Yup.

01:19:10.737 --> 01:19:13.655
Marty, will you get away
from the window!

01:19:13.865 --> 01:19:17.614
All serene.
I think she's going to tell him tonight.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:20.656
The longer she waits,
the harder it's gonna be.

01:19:20.831 --> 01:19:24.875
I don't see what the big deal is.
I mean, she had a heart transplant.

01:19:25.377 --> 01:19:29.624
I went with a girl that had a club foot.
She had the big shoe and everything.

01:19:29.756 --> 01:19:33.291
- You'll be remembered in heaven for that.
- You're a saint.

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:37.218
Bet she had a hell of a personality
to put up with you.

01:19:37.722 --> 01:19:40.557
He better not hurt her,
that's all I've got to say.

01:19:40.684 --> 01:19:41.964
What's this?

01:19:42.102 --> 01:19:44.225
Everybody's picking on me now!

01:19:50.235 --> 01:19:53.853
- Come on, simmer down.
- How many cards you want?

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:57.820
Hold it. Let's play some Pavarotti -
give 'em a little inspiration.

01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:01.735
They don't need any music out there,
Angelo.

01:20:01.871 --> 01:20:05.572
Wait a minute, how about some Bing?

01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:09.160
Bing, no! We need Bobby.

01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:13.125
At least play something bearable.

01:20:13.758 --> 01:20:16.759
Sorry, excuse me. Look...

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.503
They'll make their own music.

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.675
Come on. Let me handle this.

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:27.939
- I had a good time tonight.
- So did l.

01:20:28.731 --> 01:20:30.356
I had a great time.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.152
She likes Dean or Frank.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.692
We need somethin' modern.
Don't you have any new albums?

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:42.942
These are all new - the latest thing.

01:20:43.079 --> 01:20:45.321
Angelo, you pick out one.

01:20:45.456 --> 01:20:49.584
If I pick out one it's Sinatra.
Who the hell else is there?

01:20:50.628 --> 01:20:53.166
In the beginning... was Sinatra.

01:20:53.298 --> 01:20:56.501
And ever shall be
Frankie Sinatra, the one and only.

01:20:56.634 --> 01:20:59.208
Back in style, though dead.

01:20:59.345 --> 01:21:01.302
Frankie! Sing it, baby.

01:21:01.764 --> 01:21:04.006
What is this? A baseball game?

01:21:04.183 --> 01:21:08.181
- Oh, God, it's a live concert.
- That'll work.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.066
- I'll make 'em turn it off.
- No. No.

01:21:16.946 --> 01:21:18.986
It's nice.

01:21:19.949 --> 01:21:21.989
What's goin' on over there?

01:21:22.118 --> 01:21:24.407
Let it work its magic.

01:21:24.537 --> 01:21:26.576
Or merely the mock?

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:31.324
Oh, no. I'm really not a very good dancer.

01:21:31.961 --> 01:21:34.369
You'll be fine.

01:21:35.465 --> 01:21:41.337
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

01:21:43.306 --> 01:21:45.512
Is it for all time

01:21:45.641 --> 01:21:48.179
Or simply a lark?

01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:52.516
Is it Granada I see

01:21:52.648 --> 01:21:55.222
Or only Asbury Park?

01:21:56.694 --> 01:22:02.364
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?

01:22:03.284 --> 01:22:05.323
Or is it at long

01:22:06.787 --> 01:22:09.705
Long last love?

01:22:10.791 --> 01:22:12.831
Is it an earthquake

01:22:13.502 --> 01:22:15.542
Or simply a shock?

01:22:17.381 --> 01:22:19.421
Is it that good turtle soup

01:22:19.717 --> 01:22:21.756
Or merely the mock?

01:22:22.428 --> 01:22:25.298
- Is it the cocktail
- ls it the cocktail

01:22:25.431 --> 01:22:28.764
- This feeling of joy?
- This feeling ofjoy?

01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:36.191
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

01:22:37.943 --> 01:22:40.399
Is it for all time

01:22:40.529 --> 01:22:42.569
Or simply a lark?

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:47.405
Is it Granada I see

01:22:47.536 --> 01:22:50.621
Or onlyAsbury Park?

01:22:51.582 --> 01:22:53.621
Is it a fancy

01:22:54.919 --> 01:22:58.003
Not worth thinking of?

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:01.001
Or is it at long

01:23:01.592 --> 01:23:03.917
ls this at long

01:23:05.054 --> 01:23:11.388
At long last love?

01:23:15.064 --> 01:23:18.183
- Hey, Tommy, did you get that...?
- It's all done.

01:23:18.317 --> 01:23:22.397
- You don't know what I'm gonna ask you.
- We got it done. Trust me.

01:23:22.529 --> 01:23:25.780
- Charlie.
- Bennington called.

01:23:25.908 --> 01:23:29.158
I told him the dedication
is gonna be in a couple of weeks.

01:23:29.286 --> 01:23:34.031
He's postponing his vacation
cos he insists on doing your intro.

01:23:36.085 --> 01:23:38.042
Elizabeth would love that, huh?

01:23:40.297 --> 01:23:42.088
She would love this.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.251
- You did it.
- Took me long enough.

01:23:46.386 --> 01:23:49.304
Bob, I'm going to order one more
double-glass panel.

01:23:49.431 --> 01:23:51.139
No, Jeff. Hold up.

01:23:54.019 --> 01:23:56.688
Want to get a beer? Or is tonight bingo(?)

01:23:56.814 --> 01:24:00.763
- Take some time off.
- Grace wants to talk after dinner tonight.

01:24:00.901 --> 01:24:05.527
She wants to talk, she's making dinner
and she never stays over. Don't you see?

01:24:05.656 --> 01:24:10.068
She probably read that book with the
laws, the rules, whatever they call it.

01:24:10.202 --> 01:24:14.413
This is a game that all women play
just to reel us in.

01:24:14.539 --> 01:24:17.659
- Well, it's workin'.
- You are so sad.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:20.038
Hey, kids!

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:23.005
Sammy Sosa! Right here!

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:25.879
- It's him!
- Everybody!

01:24:32.975 --> 01:24:35.430
So... I'm going to tell him tonight.

01:24:35.852 --> 01:24:38.640
- Please. I've heard that before.
- No, I am.

01:24:38.772 --> 01:24:41.310
Well, you should. Because he's perfect.

01:24:41.441 --> 01:24:42.639
Yeah.

01:24:43.777 --> 01:24:45.437
Yeah. For me he is.

01:24:45.612 --> 01:24:47.688
Don't get me wrong - he's no Joe.

01:24:47.823 --> 01:24:49.447
- Honey?
- Yes?

01:24:49.616 --> 01:24:52.072
Austin got sick all over my shirt.

01:24:52.202 --> 01:24:55.618
I gave him a baby Tylenol
and put him in his PJs.

01:24:55.831 --> 01:24:59.034
He's going to sleep in our bed. Again!

01:25:02.129 --> 01:25:04.620
Kid keeps gettin' sick.

01:25:06.133 --> 01:25:09.169
I shouldn't have given him
that pepperoni pizza.

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:10.547
What?

01:25:10.679 --> 01:25:15.091
You should put on a shirt or Grace
will never be satisfied by another man.

01:25:17.227 --> 01:25:19.266
You like that, baby?

01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:23.435
- I'm a bad cat!
- He's all muscle.

01:25:24.818 --> 01:25:27.902
Come on, you can dance with me.

01:25:28.029 --> 01:25:32.241
- Gracie, you wanna dance with me?
- Our rhythm gets us in trouble.

01:25:47.173 --> 01:25:51.634
- Sure you don't want any help?
- Amazingly, I can microwave popcorn(!)

01:25:55.432 --> 01:26:01.386
Did you see the write-up in the Trib
about the dedication comin' up?

01:26:01.521 --> 01:26:03.763
No. I have to read that.

01:26:03.898 --> 01:26:05.772
Yeah.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.605
Everyone wants to be there.
Grandpa and the guys.

01:26:08.903 --> 01:26:12.438
- Oh. As long as you're there.
- Course I'll be there.

01:26:12.991 --> 01:26:14.449
Hey, Mel.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.401
Good boy.

01:26:20.165 --> 01:26:21.707
Oh, that's enough.

01:26:21.833 --> 01:26:25.617
Sydney is going to love
his new place - I hope.

01:26:25.753 --> 01:26:27.876
I'm thinking about movin' in myself.

01:26:28.006 --> 01:26:30.627
It's... it's... it's perfect for him.

01:26:31.134 --> 01:26:33.210
- I bet you can't wait.
- Yeah.

01:26:34.387 --> 01:26:35.881
Finally.

01:26:36.014 --> 01:26:38.718
You've been workin' so hard.

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:40.926
But it's been worth it.

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.724
To make Elizabeth's dream come true.

01:26:46.691 --> 01:26:48.980
At least I could do that for her.

01:26:51.279 --> 01:26:53.437
I'm sure she's very proud of you.

01:26:57.744 --> 01:26:59.783
Thank you, Grace.

01:27:17.138 --> 01:27:20.305
- There's something you want to tell me?
- Yeah.

01:27:24.604 --> 01:27:26.976
And now would be a good time.

01:27:29.775 --> 01:27:31.483
Popcorn's done!

01:27:33.529 --> 01:27:35.154
OK.

01:27:35.865 --> 01:27:37.145
Sorry.

01:27:37.283 --> 01:27:39.192
- Would you save my place?
- Sure.

01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:47.626
Oh, I got a new CD.
You wanna put on some music?

01:27:48.794 --> 01:27:50.834
Yes, good.

01:27:50.963 --> 01:27:52.790
OK...

01:27:52.924 --> 01:27:55.130
Where's the music?

01:27:55.259 --> 01:27:58.260
It's in my jacket pocket. In the den.

01:27:58.387 --> 01:28:00.427
Oh, OK.

01:28:51.398 --> 01:28:55.313
"Dr Elizabeth Rueland died
in a car accident on April 12th."

01:28:56.987 --> 01:28:59.027
April 12th...

01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:42.775
Grace?

01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:45.409
Gracie?

01:29:45.869 --> 01:29:49.404
Jeez, the microwave. There's not
gonna be any popcorn tonight.

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.082
- I'm sorry.
- What?

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.619
I have to go.

01:29:52.751 --> 01:29:54.080
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:29:54.211 --> 01:29:55.290
Why?

01:29:55.671 --> 01:29:59.289
I completely forgot - I promised Megan
I was gonna babysit for her.

01:29:59.424 --> 01:30:00.835
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

01:30:01.009 --> 01:30:03.381
- I'll go with you.
- No! No!

01:30:03.512 --> 01:30:05.220
I'll drive us.

01:30:05.347 --> 01:30:08.348
It's OK, cos I got my bike.
I got to take my bicycle.

01:30:10.143 --> 01:30:12.302
- Damn bike is so old!
- You OK?

01:30:12.437 --> 01:30:16.684
Yeah, I'm fine, I just... it's late
and she's gonna be worried about me.

01:30:16.817 --> 01:30:18.856
Slow down a bit.

01:30:19.444 --> 01:30:21.852
Gimme that, you're gonna hurt yourself.

01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:24.906
- I'm late.
- OK. I'll just throw this in the truck.

01:30:25.033 --> 01:30:28.533
No, no, no. I'm here, I'm here.
Just let me go.

01:30:28.662 --> 01:30:32.410
All right. I'll call Megan
and tell her that you're on your way.

01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:35.874
- No, because the baby might be napping.
- All right.

01:30:36.002 --> 01:30:39.454
- She's gonna be worried. Don't call her!
- Relax. OK!

01:30:39.589 --> 01:30:43.919
- What was it you wanted to tell me?
- Nothing! It doesn't matter.

01:30:48.765 --> 01:30:50.176
Mel, stay!

01:31:05.407 --> 01:31:07.446
Come on.

01:31:11.037 --> 01:31:12.829
- Oh, my God!
- Honey...

01:31:12.956 --> 01:31:15.364
What was God thinking?

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:18.667
- I'll take you over there and you tell him.
- No, I can't go!

01:31:18.795 --> 01:31:19.993
Yes, you can.

01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:23.546
- I can't say anything to him.
- Yes you can, you'll just tell him.

01:31:23.717 --> 01:31:24.997
How?

01:31:25.176 --> 01:31:27.549
Just: "Bob... You know, l..."

01:31:28.471 --> 01:31:31.425
"Bob..." You know, you say it. "Bob..."

01:31:31.641 --> 01:31:33.515
You can't even say it.

01:31:33.643 --> 01:31:39.183
Not off the top of my head - I need time
to think - but we'll find the perfect words.

01:31:39.316 --> 01:31:42.649
I'll help you and I'll bring you there. OK?

01:31:42.777 --> 01:31:45.399
- I'll go with you.
- I don't want to go.

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:48.864
I'll wait in the car, of course,
but you go in and... say it.

01:31:48.992 --> 01:31:51.447
But there's nothing we can say.

01:31:52.579 --> 01:31:54.156
Oh Christ! Who died?

01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:57.082
- No one.
- Bob's wife.

01:31:58.001 --> 01:32:01.121
- He's married?!
- Oh, God.

01:32:01.296 --> 01:32:02.327
That rat bastard!

01:32:02.464 --> 01:32:04.006
That rat bastard!

01:32:04.132 --> 01:32:07.216
You want me to go over
and handle that sonofabitch?

01:32:07.343 --> 01:32:11.637
I knew it - that hairline,
the creative type - it's a given.

01:32:11.764 --> 01:32:14.884
- You don't understand!
- I swear, I will kick his ass!

01:32:15.018 --> 01:32:17.094
I will kick the shit out of him!

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:18.468
Quit pushin' me!

01:32:18.646 --> 01:32:20.686
Grace, you want me to handle it?

01:32:20.857 --> 01:32:24.190
I'll kick the shit out of him for you, Grace.
Son of a bitch!

01:32:24.319 --> 01:32:27.818
Joe, please!
Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart.

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.035
He's not married?

01:32:36.497 --> 01:32:37.778
Oh.

01:32:38.916 --> 01:32:40.459
OK.

01:32:40.585 --> 01:32:42.459
- You want some ice cream?
- Yeah.

01:32:42.587 --> 01:32:44.912
You want somethin', hon? Grace?

01:32:50.553 --> 01:32:53.471
I called over to Fabrizio.

01:32:54.057 --> 01:32:57.141
- He'll pick you up in Rome.
- OK.

01:32:58.561 --> 01:33:01.977
I can't go over there myself
until the fall.

01:33:02.815 --> 01:33:08.735
Because Angelo and Sophie need my help
in the busy summer season.

01:33:08.863 --> 01:33:10.772
I know, Grandpa.

01:33:13.117 --> 01:33:16.985
I guess... you could go without me.

01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:21.833
Grandpa...

01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:24.667
I think it's for the best.

01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:27.834
It'll be easier for Bob if I'm gone.

01:33:28.382 --> 01:33:30.790
It's only you I'm concerned about.

01:33:36.098 --> 01:33:40.725
Once I tell him...
I'm gonna want to go away.

01:33:45.858 --> 01:33:48.017
- Hey, Marty!
- Hello, Robert!

01:33:48.778 --> 01:33:50.153
Hey, Gracie.

01:33:50.321 --> 01:33:53.772
Close your eyes and don't open 'em
until I tell you, OK?

01:33:53.908 --> 01:33:55.568
Now, listen...

01:33:55.701 --> 01:34:00.577
It's the character that's the strongest
that God gives the most challenges to.

01:34:00.706 --> 01:34:03.458
Now, you can take that as a compliment!

01:34:03.584 --> 01:34:05.660
Your eyes closed?

01:34:05.795 --> 01:34:07.871
- Yup.
- Keep 'em closed now.

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:12.046
No peekin'.

01:34:12.176 --> 01:34:16.387
Come on, put your hand over your eyes.
I can't tell.

01:34:18.307 --> 01:34:20.513
Hold on. Keep 'em closed.

01:34:23.437 --> 01:34:25.430
Open. Ta-da!

01:34:29.652 --> 01:34:31.229
A bike.

01:34:31.362 --> 01:34:35.312
- You haven't even opened it yet!
- You bought me a bike.

01:34:36.408 --> 01:34:38.235
- With a basket.
- Yeah.

01:34:38.369 --> 01:34:42.153
I got it at Rudy's down on Addison.
He restores vintage bikes.

01:34:42.289 --> 01:34:44.745
This one had your name all over it.

01:34:48.170 --> 01:34:50.210
I think she likes it!

01:34:51.382 --> 01:34:52.924
Are you OK?

01:34:53.092 --> 01:34:55.927
I was worried about you last night.

01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:59.721
I'm goin' away.

01:35:00.766 --> 01:35:01.929
What?

01:35:03.477 --> 01:35:06.846
- I'm goin' away.
- Why?

01:35:08.315 --> 01:35:11.067
I should have told you... somethin' l...

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:14.778
I didn't have the courage to tell you.

01:35:17.908 --> 01:35:20.695
A little over a year ago I had surgery.

01:35:22.579 --> 01:35:24.406
I had a heart transplant.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.834
Oh, my God! I thought you were
going to say you were a man.

01:35:28.961 --> 01:35:30.953
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

01:35:31.088 --> 01:35:34.042
You're OK now. You're fine.
You're healed.

01:35:34.174 --> 01:35:36.131
You could have told me that.

01:35:37.261 --> 01:35:42.088
I should have told you.
I'm really sorry I didn't. But l...

01:35:45.185 --> 01:35:47.225
When I, uh...

01:35:47.688 --> 01:35:51.436
I found this in your house.

01:35:57.948 --> 01:35:59.987
That's me.

01:36:01.368 --> 01:36:06.955
I'm goin' away tonight, um...
so you won't be reminded.

01:36:07.666 --> 01:36:10.999
I... I didn't know. I didn't know that...

01:36:11.128 --> 01:36:13.120
I swear to God I didn't know.

01:36:15.090 --> 01:36:18.625
I'm so sorry. I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:36:19.845 --> 01:36:21.672
I... I gotta go.

01:36:21.972 --> 01:36:24.973
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- OK.

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.511
I gotta...

01:36:28.145 --> 01:36:30.600
- walk.
- OK.

01:36:55.839 --> 01:36:59.172
You're not going to
try to check that on to the aeroplane?

01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:00.711
I wanna take it.

01:37:00.886 --> 01:37:05.382
- Marty, come on. Let her take it.
- But I can bring it over when I go over.

01:37:05.515 --> 01:37:09.050
Sweetie, I did check the machine again.
Still no call from him.

01:37:09.185 --> 01:37:11.059
Oh well, now you better stay.

01:37:11.187 --> 01:37:15.232
Sometimes you gotta run away
to see if somebody's gonna follow.

01:37:15.358 --> 01:37:19.438
I've told her I'm going to follow her
but I can't get over until the fall.

01:37:19.571 --> 01:37:20.733
Jesus!

01:37:20.905 --> 01:37:25.982
- Are you sure he knows you're leaving?
- Yeah. I told him I was going away.

01:37:28.788 --> 01:37:32.833
Here's a little snack, honey.
I love you so much.

01:37:32.959 --> 01:37:34.501
Sweetheart.

01:37:34.627 --> 01:37:37.961
Pray in Rome. God'll hear you better.

01:37:39.132 --> 01:37:41.801
Oh, I hate to say goodbye to you.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.680
Oh, well...

01:37:50.602 --> 01:37:52.429
Away you go.

01:37:56.191 --> 01:37:57.649
Yeah.

01:37:59.819 --> 01:38:01.611
OK.

01:38:03.364 --> 01:38:06.318
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, darlin'.

01:38:07.494 --> 01:38:09.071
Bye.

01:40:23.003 --> 01:40:25.126
Hey, Charlie, it's me.

01:40:25.256 --> 01:40:27.165
I need to talk to someone.

01:40:28.384 --> 01:40:31.053
No... not over the phone.

01:40:32.263 --> 01:40:33.721
Can you meet me?

01:40:35.182 --> 01:40:37.389
Yes, 12.30 is fine.

01:40:37.518 --> 01:40:39.557
Thanks. Thank you.

01:40:43.857 --> 01:40:46.562
The inspector's here. Drink up.

01:40:52.366 --> 01:40:54.275
Scusa. You like?

01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:56.367
Oh. No, thank you.

01:40:57.413 --> 01:41:00.283
Maybe... it help you paint?

01:41:00.416 --> 01:41:01.744
Oh, it...

01:41:01.875 --> 01:41:06.169
No, I was going to
go home now, to... a casa.

01:41:07.089 --> 01:41:09.128
Thank you, though. Thanks.

01:41:10.175 --> 01:41:11.800
He is married?

01:41:15.889 --> 01:41:17.432
It's a long story.

01:41:26.316 --> 01:41:29.401
I take my break now.

01:41:37.578 --> 01:41:38.823
Wow!

01:41:40.372 --> 01:41:41.535
Yeah.

01:41:43.917 --> 01:41:45.246
Wow!

01:41:46.545 --> 01:41:47.873
Yeah.

01:41:48.839 --> 01:41:51.246
Mamma mia.

01:41:51.383 --> 01:41:52.877
Si.

01:42:04.605 --> 01:42:06.893
- Who's takin' me?
- All right.

01:42:08.066 --> 01:42:10.106
No, no, Marty. I'll get it.

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.193
All right. Night, boys.

01:42:13.655 --> 01:42:16.941
Good night, Sophie, dear.
See you tomorrow.

01:42:17.075 --> 01:42:19.115
Take care, Wally.

01:42:20.537 --> 01:42:23.573
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.086
- What?
- The door.

01:42:32.215 --> 01:42:34.255
Oh. Sure.

01:42:35.218 --> 01:42:37.341
What a guy!

01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:44.175
Wally! It's Bob!

01:42:55.697 --> 01:42:58.817
What's this?
I thought you took her home.

01:42:58.950 --> 01:43:01.109
- Short ride.
- I'm in.

01:43:01.661 --> 01:43:05.576
- But we're not even playin'.
- Shhh!

01:43:12.255 --> 01:43:15.292
- She's not here.
- How you been?

01:43:15.884 --> 01:43:19.964
- Hungry? I'll make you a plate of pasta.
- No, thanks, Angelo.

01:43:20.096 --> 01:43:23.465
- She left?
- Oh, aye, it's two days now.

01:43:28.063 --> 01:43:30.186
I've been thinkin'...

01:43:32.359 --> 01:43:35.395
- The dedication's next week.
- Yes.

01:43:36.154 --> 01:43:39.605
And, uh... it means so much to me.

01:43:41.076 --> 01:43:42.486
And to Elizabeth.

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:45.365
- Sure.
- Well, you've been workin' like a dog!

01:43:45.497 --> 01:43:48.035
I miss Elizabeth.

01:43:49.918 --> 01:43:51.744
I'll always miss her.

01:43:53.213 --> 01:43:54.837
But I, uh...

01:43:58.802 --> 01:44:01.672
I ache for Grace.

01:44:03.056 --> 01:44:05.048
And I don't know if I can...

01:44:06.684 --> 01:44:08.760
- I don't know if she...
- She can!

01:44:08.895 --> 01:44:10.852
Shh!

01:44:16.319 --> 01:44:17.599
Here, Bob.

01:44:18.529 --> 01:44:20.771
Come along with me a moment.

01:44:30.917 --> 01:44:32.459
They'll be fine.

01:44:35.546 --> 01:44:37.539
Angelo, siddown.

01:44:37.674 --> 01:44:39.583
Stay loose, baby.

01:44:43.137 --> 01:44:48.558
Only Gracie can tell you the name
of every flower in this garden.

01:44:50.561 --> 01:44:53.681
I know no more than
one or two of them myself.

01:44:54.607 --> 01:44:56.267
What's happening?

01:44:57.068 --> 01:45:00.651
- He's got him in a choke hold. Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:05.193
- Marty, don't do it!
- What are you talking about?

01:45:05.535 --> 01:45:10.695
Now, Robert...
This is none of my business.

01:45:11.916 --> 01:45:16.708
I know that what's happened
has been... overwhelming.

01:45:19.048 --> 01:45:22.583
And I know it's going to take you
a good while to sort it all out.

01:45:23.886 --> 01:45:28.513
But while you're sorting, I want you
to remember that in all the times

01:45:28.641 --> 01:45:33.267
I prayed that Gracie would have
a second chance at life,

01:45:34.897 --> 01:45:38.598
I always knew that if God blessed us

01:45:40.069 --> 01:45:43.153
the heart she got
would have to be from

01:45:44.699 --> 01:45:47.699
a very special person

01:45:49.328 --> 01:45:53.907
if it were going to be at home in Grace.

01:45:56.877 --> 01:45:58.621
When she met you

01:45:59.171 --> 01:46:02.457
her heart beat truly for the first time.

01:46:03.926 --> 01:46:08.006
Perhaps it was meant
to be with you always.

01:46:18.482 --> 01:46:21.567
O! Che bella bicicletta!

01:46:23.445 --> 01:46:24.904
É sua?

01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:27.070
- It's mine, yes.
- Bella!

01:46:27.783 --> 01:46:33.026
Ah! Ogni volta che si suona il campanello
agli angeli spuntano le ali!

01:46:33.163 --> 01:46:35.121
Would you like to ride it?

01:46:35.291 --> 01:46:37.616
- Si, si, prova.
- No, no.

01:46:37.751 --> 01:46:39.791
Yes. Here.

01:46:40.921 --> 01:46:43.377
- O no, no.
- Si, si.

01:46:45.301 --> 01:46:47.340
Prova.

01:46:47.803 --> 01:46:49.843
Uno soltanto.

01:47:16.665 --> 01:47:20.116
Ma torna. Stai tranquilla, torna.

01:47:20.252 --> 01:47:25.708
Si! Le piaceva tanto la bicicletta.
Era un amore...

01:47:38.770 --> 01:47:40.229
Tuo amor?

01:47:42.357 --> 01:47:43.935
Si.

01:47:51.783 --> 01:47:53.741
You came all the way to ltaly?

01:47:54.411 --> 01:47:56.071
Yeah, I did.

01:48:01.293 --> 01:48:03.001
I came all the way to ltaly.

01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:23.436
I love you, Grace.

01:49:06.983 --> 01:49:10.851
A lot of you have come up to me today

01:49:10.987 --> 01:49:15.448
because you recognise me
from my photo in the monkey house.

01:49:19.287 --> 01:49:24.079
But my sizeable donations
down through the years

01:49:24.876 --> 01:49:27.996
is not what we're here to talk about.

01:49:28.421 --> 01:49:33.167
Ladies and gentlemen - Bob Rueland!

01:49:40.016 --> 01:49:44.678
Thank you for that introduction
and for your generous contribution.

01:49:44.813 --> 01:49:48.312
I would like to thank everyone
who contributed time and energy.

01:49:48.483 --> 01:49:52.397
My incredibly dedicated crew,
sitting right there.

01:49:52.529 --> 01:49:57.570
And supervising veterinarian - my good,
my dear friend Dr Charles Johnson.

01:49:57.784 --> 01:49:59.575
Hey, Charlie!

01:50:00.829 --> 01:50:05.621
He apparently will be signing autographs
after the ceremony.

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:09.415
The dedication of this new home
for Sydney and his family

01:50:09.546 --> 01:50:12.083
holds great personal meaning for me.

01:50:12.715 --> 01:50:17.377
My late wife Elizabeth
spent many years with Sydney.

01:50:17.512 --> 01:50:21.510
She taught him... so many things.
She envisioned this for him.

01:50:21.641 --> 01:50:26.137
She taught him sign language.
She introduced him to his wife.

01:50:27.397 --> 01:50:29.852
But more importantly,

01:50:29.983 --> 01:50:36.863
it was her uncompromising passion
that brings us here together today.

01:50:38.241 --> 01:50:41.692
So it is with great honour

01:50:43.579 --> 01:50:46.284
that I dedicate this new habitat

01:50:46.416 --> 01:50:50.247
in loving memory of Elizabeth Rueland.

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:18.272
Will everybody clear the dance floor

01:51:18.406 --> 01:51:21.407
so that the bride and groom
may have the first dance.
