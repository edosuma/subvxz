what I'm looking for.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.995
Intractable symptoms of PTSD.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.431
Flashbacks...

10:06.475 --> 10:08.259
panic attacks...

10:08.303 --> 10:10.522
recurrent hallucinations.

10:10.566 --> 10:13.308
Were you experiencing
any of these symptoms?

10:13.351 --> 10:15.179
Absolutely not.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.746
And I'm not just saying that

10:16.790 --> 10:18.443
because otherwise
you would declare me deranged

10:18.487 --> 10:22.491
and I would lose my job...
slash-coping mechanism.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.188
[laughs]

10:24.232 --> 10:26.321
See, now, this is stimulating.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.932
Two overeducated adult men

10:28.976 --> 10:30.847
sparring over psychology.

10:30.891 --> 10:34.111
So, what happened
at the crime scene?

10:34.155 --> 10:36.548
Nothing.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.115
I told you I was fine.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.813
DANI:
Something happened out there.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.772
Bright looked spooked.
Or even paler than usual.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.644
Which is saying something.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.297
Did Lieutenant Arroyo agree?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.385
Did he bring you back on?

10:47.429 --> 10:48.778
GIL:
No.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.476
Bright is one of my team's
best assets,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.783
but administrative leave
is always recommended

10:53.827 --> 10:56.830
following an incident
in the field.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.309
Then how did Bright know

10:58.353 --> 11:00.485
to show up
for the autopsy report?

11:00.529 --> 11:01.965
I told him!

11:02.009 --> 11:04.968
Malcolm Bright composed
a 100% accurate profile

11:05.012 --> 11:07.231
of the Kingdom Lake Killer
that is the stuff of legends.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.973
[chuckles] Are you into any
of the true crime boards?

11:10.017 --> 11:11.061
Websleuths, Justice Quest?

11:11.105 --> 11:14.325
He has quite...
quite a following.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.545
Also, I just missed him.

11:16.588 --> 11:20.157
Oh, don't write that.
[laughs]

11:20.201 --> 11:22.246
DANI:
Tristan Johnston, 21.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.508
His prints were in the system.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.336
Couple misdemeanors
for shoplifting.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.730
He was strangled,
and the other injuries indicate

11:27.774 --> 11:29.558
that he was beaten
severely prior.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.821
The burns remain a puzzler--

11:31.865 --> 11:34.041
they predate Tristan's death
by at least a week.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.347
-What do we know about the guy?
-He was a runaway.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.828
Talked to the dad.
Said Tristan lived at home

11:38.872 --> 11:40.743
outside of Atlanta,
up until he went missing

11:40.787 --> 11:42.353
about a year ago.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.747
He had a, uh, credit card in
his dad's name when he took off.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.444
The last charge
that Tristan made

11:46.488 --> 11:47.489
before he turned off the account

11:47.532 --> 11:49.752
was $5,000
at the Vosler Institute.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.014
The Vosler Institute?

11:51.058 --> 11:53.756
Some kind of
self-help organization, right?

11:53.800 --> 11:56.846
Books, lectures.
They got a spot in Midtown?

11:56.890 --> 11:59.544
They also have many attributes
of a cult.

11:59.588 --> 12:03.070
In fact, it's on
the FBI's cult index.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.855
Was there a traumatic event
in Tristan's family

12:05.899 --> 12:07.465
around the time he ran away?

12:07.509 --> 12:10.251
Yeah. His mother died.
Lung cancer.

12:10.294 --> 12:13.950
Cults prey on those
with low self-worth.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.909
Schizotypal thinkers.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.563
Tristan was a loner
and a perceived failure

12:18.607 --> 12:20.043
in an unhappy family life.

12:20.087 --> 12:23.568
A cult offered him a sense
of belonging,

12:23.612 --> 12:27.311
a place where he could feel
welcomed and validated.

12:27.355 --> 12:30.053
Have you heard of them?
The Vosler Institute?

12:30.097 --> 12:35.624
Uh, cult psychology's
not really my area of expertise.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.799
GIL:
Based on Tristan's
bank records,

12:36.843 --> 12:39.323
we went to visit Vosler.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.934
And Bright went to bed.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.632
Or so we thought.

12:43.675 --> 12:47.767
I have developed
a treatment program.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.813
A treatment program
that removes those traumas.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.076
Here at the Vosler Institute...

12:53.120 --> 12:54.251
Doesn't look like a cult.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.297
...we can help you ascend

12:56.340 --> 13:01.084
to a better life...
that's just waiting for you.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.434
Thank you.

13:03.478 --> 13:07.351
Oh, there are, uh,
books available for purchase.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.005
Just say hello to one
of my ambassadors.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.792
-Quentin Vosler?
-Yes?

13:12.835 --> 13:15.795
NYPD. We need to ask you
a few questions.

13:15.838 --> 13:16.708
Of course.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.101
We're investigating a homicide.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.800
Victim might have been involved
in one of your programs.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.192
Tristan Johnston?

13:22.236 --> 13:25.456
Tristan? Yes, he, uh,
wasone of us,

13:25.500 --> 13:27.154
but he rejected my program.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.546
Left the Institute.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.374
I can't speak to what happened
to him after that.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.941
Do you have any records
that could tell us

13:31.985 --> 13:34.161
what types of treatments
he received here?

13:34.204 --> 13:36.293
Who he worked with?

13:36.337 --> 13:39.209
Uh, the inner workings
of my organization

13:39.253 --> 13:41.472
are proprietary, Detective,

13:41.516 --> 13:42.822
involving
multiple trade secrets,

13:42.865 --> 13:44.519
so unless you have
multiple warrants...

13:46.390 --> 13:49.176
Excuse me.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.962
Okay, maybe it is a cult.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.485
GIL:
He's hiding something.

13:54.529 --> 13:55.965
Check into his
business practices,

13:56.009 --> 13:57.706
see if we can start
pulling those warrants.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.361
We hit a dead end with Vosler.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.580
But Bright had plans of his own.

14:02.624 --> 14:06.193
All classes are open
to the public,

14:06.236 --> 14:08.978
but Quentin's very selective
as to who he'll accept

14:09.022 --> 14:10.414
in our private
therapeutic regimen.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.983
I really want to work
with Quentin himself.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.898
He enrolled himself?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.988
[chuckling]:
What a knucklehead.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.685
You got to love the guy.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.863
So, I'll just go ahead
and process your responses.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.868
Wow.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.871
I've never seen a score
this high.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.785
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

14:33.829 --> 14:36.876
Bad... I guess.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.008
But it's great
for your future here.

14:39.052 --> 14:42.533
Your experience
with trauma is...

14:42.577 --> 14:43.752
compelling.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.276
It was a minimally altered
Myers-Briggs.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.540
Hardly difficult to crack
for us overeducated adults.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.020
I think we could
really help you.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.196
My God, I hope so.
[chuckles]

14:53.240 --> 14:56.199
What led you to the Institute?

14:56.243 --> 14:59.072
My friend, um,
Tristan Johnston.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.030
Does he still take courses here?

15:01.074 --> 15:03.903
Uh, I'm-I'm not sure.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.426
We, we have so many members.

15:07.515 --> 15:10.039
When would you like to start?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.388
Right now.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.565
Wonderful. Cash or check?

15:14.609 --> 15:16.916
COPPENRATH:
You were conducting
your own investigation.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.048
Did you worry about
Lieutenant Arroyo finding out?

15:19.092 --> 15:21.268
-Losing your job?
-A little.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.835
But going home scared you more.
Why is that?

15:23.879 --> 15:25.925
He can't go home,
he can't follow orders,

15:25.968 --> 15:27.665
and he can't sleep.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.059
That's why he works
these cases so hard.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.061
Well, I was afraid
my comically Germanic nurse

15:32.105 --> 15:34.411
would try to judo me to death.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.109
Uh-huh.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.460
Tell me about Vosler.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.855
Mr. Bright. I'm Quentin Vosler.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.640
Thank you
for revealing your pain.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.251
Is this really gonna work?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.427
The ideal candidate
for my therapy

15:50.471 --> 15:52.429
is someone
with resistant trauma.

15:52.473 --> 15:53.648
That's you.

15:54.692 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, I just, uh...

15:58.044 --> 15:59.306
YOUNG BRIGHT:
He tried to kill us.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.091
I want it to go away.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.441
Well, this treatment
is just the first step

16:04.485 --> 16:06.661
on our journey together.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.666
Is that...?

16:11.709 --> 16:14.669
Electroconvulsive therapy. Yes.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.279
You're scared.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.281
COPPENRATH:
Electroshock?

16:18.325 --> 16:20.109
-You're kidding.
-Tristan's burns

16:20.153 --> 16:22.329
indicated he went through
the same treatment.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.157
That procedure
is only administered

16:24.200 --> 16:25.680
after psychiatric review

16:25.723 --> 16:28.683
with certified technicians
and anesthesia.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.815
Vosler's out of his mind.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.818
Today, anyone can improve their
body using plastic surgery.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.646
I believe people should be able

16:35.690 --> 16:38.649
to electively improve
their minds as well.

16:38.693 --> 16:42.305
With this,
we can purge your memories

16:42.349 --> 16:43.872
and ease your pain.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.439
I promise.

16:46.701 --> 16:47.658
So, what did you do?

16:47.702 --> 16:50.096
Oh, I let him shock me.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.017
[beeps]

16:59.540 --> 17:02.021
[whirring]

17:02.064 --> 17:03.370
[electricity crackling]

17:03.413 --> 17:05.546
[Bright grunting]

17:12.596 --> 17:13.945
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[indistinct whispering]

17:13.989 --> 17:15.382
[heart beating]

17:18.385 --> 17:20.735
[whispering stops]

17:20.778 --> 17:22.171
COPPENRATH:
You let him shock you?

17:22.215 --> 17:23.303
You're angry.

17:23.346 --> 17:26.523
Yeah. People like Vosler
make me angry.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.526
The false promises he makes.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.876
The way he appeals
to the vulnerable.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.096
I wasn't vulnerable.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.359
I was trying to solve a case.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.578
Really?

17:37.621 --> 17:40.711
When Vosler promised
to erase your pain,

17:40.755 --> 17:44.367
some part of you wanted
to believe that he could.

17:44.411 --> 17:48.893
Wasn't that more important
than the case?

17:48.937 --> 17:51.070
Nothing's more important
than the case.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.941
Oh, explain that to me.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.206
I grew up inside a case.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.209
Living with a killer.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.385
If I'd have solved
that one faster,

18:02.429 --> 18:05.910
more people
would have been saved.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.565
When I put myself in danger
to find a killer,

18:08.609 --> 18:11.568
I'm not thinking about me.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.570
I'm thinking about them.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.964
The victims.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.098
People like Andi.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.795
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[heart beating]

18:23.798 --> 18:25.234
Thirsty?

18:25.278 --> 18:28.063
[sighs]

18:32.023 --> 18:33.416
Thank you.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.288
[clears throat]

18:37.028 --> 18:39.248
How many times
have you been through it?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.945
The treatment.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.991
Eighteen.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.253
Why?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.951
[chuckles softly]
It's...

18:46.995 --> 18:49.302
such a cliché.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.609
Crap parents.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.264
But Quentin
already purged your mind.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.266
Why do you stay?

18:57.310 --> 19:00.617
Don't you have other family,
friends?

19:00.661 --> 19:02.010
Our friends'
and family's negativity

19:02.053 --> 19:03.446
can hinder our progress.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.449
Those don't sound
like your words.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.495
More like Quentin's rules.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.456
Is that why Tristan left?

19:13.500 --> 19:16.503
You knew him, didn't you?

19:23.858 --> 19:26.991
[sighs]

19:27.035 --> 19:29.298
Tristan recruited me
to the Institute.

19:29.342 --> 19:32.693
He tried to reconnect
with his father.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.347
Quentin forbid it.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.393
Andi.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.181
Tristan's dead.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.226
I work with the police.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.837
I'm here investigating
his murder.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.492
I think Quentin was responsible.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.886
He wouldn't.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.672
When I get out of here,

19:55.716 --> 19:59.023
I can make sure
he never hurts anybody else.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.895
Can you help me?

20:01.896 --> 20:04.246
I can't.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.553
I'm scared of him.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.251
Then you should come with me.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.732
You said you had crap parents.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.734
When you lived with them,
how did you feel?

20:13.777 --> 20:15.518
Vulnerable?

20:15.562 --> 20:17.520
Trapped?

20:17.564 --> 20:20.044
How do you feel here?

20:20.088 --> 20:22.743
[crying]:
I have nowhere else to go.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.701
You've thought
about leaving before.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.226
I can tell you how many times.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.010
Eighteen.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.408
ANDI:
What are you doing?

20:35.451 --> 20:38.062
This ECT machine is evidence.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.239
It ties Vosler to Tristan.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.544
Come on.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.416
Let's get out of here.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.556
I can't believe I'm doing this.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.949
Don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.211
I have to call my team.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.609
I need Lieutenant Arroyo
in the 16th Precinct.

21:02.652 --> 21:07.440
Gil. I have a witness from
inside the Vosler Institute.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.615
[tires screeching]

21:08.658 --> 21:10.356
[screams]

21:11.792 --> 21:14.142
Andi!

21:20.191 --> 21:24.587
How did Bright react
to Andi's kidnapping?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.763
He was losing it.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.592
I mean, I could see that.

21:29.636 --> 21:33.770
But I didn't want to lose him.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.295
[sighs] You could've
gotten yourself killed.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.428
I didn't, but I can't say
the same for Andi.

21:39.472 --> 21:42.953
We need to arrest Quentin Vosler
before she ends up like Tristan.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.607
How am I supposed
to get a warrant?

21:44.651 --> 21:49.046
All we've got is your
eyewitness account and-and...

21:49.090 --> 21:50.526
whatever this is.

21:50.570 --> 21:54.791
The brass knows what went down
with Watkins, Bright.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.184
They'll think you're nuts.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.015
-Tell me what you did with Andi!
-Mr. Bright.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.800
-Where is Andi?
-I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.933
She was taken by them.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.462
Your team said you became
aggressive with Vosler.

22:13.506 --> 22:16.378
Saving Andi had become
an obsession, hadn't it?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.162
Another way to avoid
your own trauma.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.643
-I was fine.
-"Fine."

22:20.687 --> 22:23.820
There's that word again.
Whenever you say you're "fine,"

22:23.864 --> 22:25.474
a warning bell
goes off in my head.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.259
Okay, I wasn't fine. I'm a mess.

22:28.303 --> 22:29.652
But I'm a mess that works.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.176
Well, I'm not arguing
that you're bad at your job.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.526
No, you're bad at yours.

22:33.569 --> 22:36.093
I am trauma.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.661
I'm good at my job
because it helps me

22:38.705 --> 22:40.228
understand the human mind.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.664
That shouldn't preclude me
from police work,

22:41.708 --> 22:43.013
it should qualify me for it.

22:43.057 --> 22:46.147
What do you really know
about trauma, Simon?

22:53.763 --> 22:56.723
Ten years ago, I was on vacation
with my daughter.

22:58.725 --> 23:02.598
We rented a little cottage
in Sunken Meadow Beach.

23:02.642 --> 23:06.515
And Lily loved the water.
She'd swim for hours.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.257
It was the perfect trip...

23:11.738 --> 23:13.566
...and our last together.

23:16.090 --> 23:20.790
I was driving, my daughter
was in the passenger seat,

23:20.834 --> 23:24.533
and I looked away
for a split second,

23:24.577 --> 23:27.754
you know, to find
a better radio station.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.847
The car flipped,
and she died on impact.

23:40.767 --> 23:44.597
And for a while,
I told myself it was inevitable,

23:44.640 --> 23:47.251
a tragic accident.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.427
It was.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.952
But not blameless.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.913
I couldn't move on
until I acknowledged

23:56.957 --> 23:59.089
my role in the crash.

23:59.133 --> 24:02.005
So stop lying to me, Bright.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.443
Stop lying to yourself.

24:04.486 --> 24:08.229
Something happened when you were
underground with John Watkins.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.840
You're haunted by it.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.584
Tell me what it is.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.456
Your father was going
to kill you.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.329
Should we continue
with the case?

24:26.160 --> 24:29.119
I'm here because I fear
for the safety of my members.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.600
The only thing
they're afraid of is you.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.124
It has been suggested
that my institute

24:34.168 --> 24:36.605
shares some of the
characteristics of a cult.

24:36.649 --> 24:39.608
Now, the van that took Andi
was identified

24:39.652 --> 24:41.305
by my members.
I don't know his name,

24:41.349 --> 24:43.786
but we've had run-ins
with this man in the past.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.310
He would call Andi's kidnapping
an "extraction."

24:46.354 --> 24:49.792
You're talking
about a deprogrammer.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.186
They save cult victims.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.362
Reunite families
with their loved ones.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.843
Save them?
He re-traumatizes them.

24:56.886 --> 24:59.367
Undoes all my good work,
and now, with Tristan,

24:59.410 --> 25:00.542
he's escalated to murder.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.894
Deprogrammers
have questionable methods,

25:04.938 --> 25:06.809
but that doesn't
make them killers.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.986
Do you have any idea
who hired the deprogrammer?

25:10.030 --> 25:11.335
Andi's late mother was American.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.337
Her father
is a Spanish national.

25:13.381 --> 25:15.644
He owns a manufacturing firm
in Barcelona,

25:15.688 --> 25:18.168
and he would spend any amount
of money to get Andi back.

25:18.212 --> 25:21.171
Deprogrammers cater
to wealthy families

25:21.215 --> 25:25.828
determined to reclaim
their wayward children.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.569
I know someone who can help.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.529
So many black sheep
of New York's finest families

25:30.572 --> 25:33.183
have been wooed by these cults.

25:33.227 --> 25:36.012
There's a very healthy rolodex
of deprogrammer types

25:36.056 --> 25:38.188
floating around Park Avenue.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.844
A-And why were you so eager
to assist in the investigation?

25:41.888 --> 25:43.585
Gil.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.674
Lieutenant Arroyo is a friend,

25:45.718 --> 25:49.112
and I enjoy when my friends
are indebted to me.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.028
Sorry, don't you plan
on asking me

25:52.072 --> 25:53.552
about Malcolm's mental health?

25:53.595 --> 25:56.859
Uh, w-w-well,
what do you think...?

25:56.903 --> 25:59.427
You should fire him immediately.

25:59.470 --> 26:03.736
Until then, I will do all I can
to help with his precious cases.

26:03.779 --> 26:08.088
So I set meetings with every
deprogrammer in New York City.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.960
My cousin Ariana was recruited
by the Moonies in the '80s.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.223
Ugh. We had a hell of a time
getting her out,

26:13.267 --> 26:17.576
but as they say,
forgive, love, unite.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.581
We'll need milk and sugar.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.061
Unless you'd prefer
something stronger?

26:25.105 --> 26:26.933
The only thing we don't serve
here is Kool-Aid.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.543
[laughing]

26:28.587 --> 26:31.633
She gave that boy everything
she had, and he joins a cult?

26:31.677 --> 26:33.026
I mean,

26:33.069 --> 26:35.419
how hard is it to accept
a trust fund, settle down,

26:35.463 --> 26:38.205
and pop out a few grandchildren?

26:40.294 --> 26:42.252
Tell me about yourself,
your work.

26:42.296 --> 26:45.429
Well, it starts with extraction.
Pick 'em up, pull 'em out.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.257
Then comes debriefing.

26:47.301 --> 26:50.086
These kids are all brainwashed.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.349
I can snap 'em out of it.

26:56.136 --> 26:59.313
Mr. Marsh,
a few more people outside

26:59.356 --> 27:01.358
would love to chat
with you, too.

27:03.491 --> 27:06.929
When Bright found Curtis Marsh,
I knew we had our guy.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.366
Been doing this long enough,
you just feel it.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.933
You got nothing.

27:10.977 --> 27:14.110
We got your boots.
They're a match to the prints

27:14.154 --> 27:15.634
we found at the crime scene.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.113
That's enough to hold you
for 24 hours.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.638
-Tell us where Andi is.
-[snaps fingers] Easy.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.642
Should've known this was
a setup. How'd you find me?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.992
You come highly recommended.

27:27.341 --> 27:30.300
Because I get results.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.650
JT:
Results like murder?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.303
Tristan Johnston left Vosler.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.783
He didn't need your help
getting out.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.699
Everyone needs a little help
from time to time.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.701
That's the job.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.138
But this job was tougher
than usual.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.793
That big, important client
wanted Andi back,

27:44.837 --> 27:46.795
and you couldn't deliver.

27:46.839 --> 27:50.712
You needed to get to Andi,
so you tortured Tristan.

27:50.756 --> 27:51.974
GIL:
But then something went wrong.

27:52.018 --> 27:55.586
You lost control,
you strangled him.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.327
Next thing you knew,
Tristan was dead.

27:57.371 --> 28:00.330
What kind of a deprogrammer
allows himself to lose control?

28:00.374 --> 28:02.028
GIL:
Curtis was trapped.

28:02.071 --> 28:05.422
After we questioned him...

28:05.466 --> 28:07.990
Bright wasn't satisfied.

28:08.034 --> 28:11.080
He was absolutely convinced

28:11.124 --> 28:13.213
that Curtis had to be working
for someone else.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.694
Arroyo said you became unhinged.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.565
You refused to accept
that the case was closed.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.175
BRIGHT:
Because it wasn't.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.524
And this argument with Gil,

28:20.568 --> 28:22.831
that's what triggered
the incident?

28:22.875 --> 28:25.355
It led to it, didn't cause it.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.010
I'd been worried
about Bright all day.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.708
Now I was scared.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.666
I-I could have
handled it better.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.843
It wasn't all his fault.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.193
Now it's really time to go home.

28:37.237 --> 28:40.022
A cult deprogrammer
must be skilled,

28:40.066 --> 28:42.372
have an understanding
of the complex psychology

28:42.416 --> 28:43.547
of mind control.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.376
Curtis is the muscle,
not the brains.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.639
Otherwise, he never
would have killed Tristan.

28:48.683 --> 28:53.383
There's someone above Curtis,
the real deprogrammer.

28:53.427 --> 28:54.733
They're controlling everything.

28:54.776 --> 28:58.562
I was right from the beginning.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.260
You're in no state
to work a case.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.566
I've been working this case.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.220
I brought you onto the team

29:04.264 --> 29:06.440
because you're the best
at what you do, Bright,

29:06.483 --> 29:08.050
but not when you get like this.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.878
"Like this"?

29:09.922 --> 29:12.272
I'm "like this"

29:12.315 --> 29:14.056
because of Martin Whitly,

29:14.100 --> 29:15.754
because of John Watkins,
because of you.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.888
What?

29:19.932 --> 29:22.238
You asked for my help.

29:22.282 --> 29:23.631
You knew I couldn't say no,

29:23.674 --> 29:25.633
and you brought them all
back into my life.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.635
You did that. You started this.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.641
[sighs]

29:36.122 --> 29:38.472
Get the hell out of my precinct.

29:38.515 --> 29:41.954
Gil, no.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.787
[indistinct whispering]

29:59.536 --> 30:01.495
Bright.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.634
Bright, open, open this door.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.767
[beeps]

30:15.509 --> 30:17.467
He tried to kill us.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.817
[whirring]

30:23.996 --> 30:25.998
Bright, open this door.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.958
[electricity crackling]

30:30.002 --> 30:32.482
He did what now?

30:32.526 --> 30:36.138
Your "incident" wiped out the
entire precinct's electricity.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.313
It wasn't my intention.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.837
Well, what was your intention?

30:38.880 --> 30:40.882
Because it wasn't
about solving the case.

30:40.926 --> 30:44.973
I did it because I had to,
because I, because I needed it.

30:45.017 --> 30:49.499
And what did you need exactly?

30:49.543 --> 30:52.502
Tell me the truth, Malcolm.
You electrocuted yourself.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.678
You could have easily died.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.159
What happened with John Watkins?

30:57.203 --> 30:59.553
What were you so desperate
to forget?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.383
He told me something.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.864
Watkins? What did he say?

31:18.050 --> 31:21.357
That when I was ten years old,

31:21.401 --> 31:24.752
Martin Whitly tried to kill me.

31:28.277 --> 31:32.368
My father... tried to kill me.

31:32.412 --> 31:33.630
Well, that's terrible,

31:33.674 --> 31:36.155
but you knew he was
a predatory psychopath.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.767
I know that.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.203
[sighs]:
My rational...

31:41.247 --> 31:45.251
overeducated mind
understands who he is.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.255
But the child in me...

31:52.649 --> 31:54.913
...thought he cared.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.440
[sighs]:
Loved me... even.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.444
Now I can't see that anymore.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.928
All I can see is me.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.801
Age ten.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.804
[whispers]:
Dead.

32:18.110 --> 32:21.461
And you mean that literally,
don't you?

32:22.679 --> 32:24.551
You arehallucinating.

32:26.205 --> 32:29.295
When Quentin shocked me...

32:29.338 --> 32:31.514
the hallucinations stopped.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.562
It worked.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.131
[sighs]:
The ECT...

32:39.174 --> 32:41.524
purged my mind.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.139
But he came back.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.403
So you shocked yourself again.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.846
You just completed your profile.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.807
You're not gonna sign off
on me working here, are you?

33:03.851 --> 33:04.983
[clicks and sets down pen]

33:05.026 --> 33:06.201
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.898
I can't.

33:11.685 --> 33:15.689
Listen, you can get help
like I did.

33:15.732 --> 33:19.127
It takes time
and commitment, but...

33:19.171 --> 33:20.650
you're very intelligent

33:20.694 --> 33:22.652
and your friends here care
about you.

33:22.696 --> 33:25.177
I'll miss them.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.006
You need real help, Malcolm,

33:28.049 --> 33:30.182
not just a coping mechanism.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.316
Good night.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.579
What about Andi?

33:38.059 --> 33:40.061
I was the only witness
to the kidnapping,

33:40.105 --> 33:42.542
and you just declared me
mentally unstable.

33:42.585 --> 33:46.328
Well, I'm sure Lieutenant Arroyo
and his team will find her.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.547
"Her"?

33:47.590 --> 33:51.333
I never said Andi was a woman.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.857
So, I assumed.
Does that matter?

33:53.901 --> 33:55.033
You're lying.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.165
Excuse me?

you never make eye contact.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.697
Because I'll see the lies.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.525

Look, you're in
a very dark place, Mr. Bright,

34:12.006 --> 34:15.183
but turning that profiler's gaze
on me won't solve your problem.

34:15.227 --> 34:16.706
I'm not the bad guy.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.057
Why did Curtis kill Tristan?

34:19.100 --> 34:22.277
Did he just forget
to pop a few pills,

34:22.321 --> 34:24.366
or is he just
that out of control?

34:24.410 --> 34:26.325
I have no idea;
I never met the man.

34:30.459 --> 34:33.419
You're the deprogrammer.

34:33.462 --> 34:36.248
No, I'm not,
but you can't see that,

34:36.291 --> 34:38.598
because you're...
riddled with trauma

34:38.641 --> 34:41.731
and the aftereffects of...
electroshock

34:41.775 --> 34:43.777
and God only knows what else.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.259
I didn't shock myself
last night.

Curtis was taking a heavy dose

35:31.912 --> 35:33.653
of antianxiety medication.

35:33.696 --> 35:36.134
Was that for his rage issues?

35:36.177 --> 35:39.137
Anxiolytics
can help regulate anger.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.139
I'm not asking you as a doctor.

35:44.054 --> 35:47.014
You prescribed them
to him, Simon.

35:47.057 --> 35:49.147
That doesn't prove anything.

35:49.190 --> 35:52.454
By itself, no.
That's why I set all this up.

35:52.498 --> 35:55.283
I knew Curtis Marsh
had someone protecting him,

35:55.327 --> 35:56.763
someone on the inside.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.461
I knew if I was right,
you'd try to discredit me to IA,

35:59.505 --> 36:01.159
shut down our investigation.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.291
You lied to me
about knowing Curtis.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.294
There's your name,
right there on that bottle.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.817

This isn't you, Simon.

37:09.923 --> 37:12.404
You're a rational man, a doctor.

37:12.447 --> 37:14.232
You're not a killer.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.276
How do youknow that?

37:17.104 --> 37:18.888
Because of Lily,

She didn't die
in a car accident.

Don't you dare.

37:24.154 --> 37:25.939
She died in a cult.

You couldn't save her.

37:28.637 --> 37:31.553
