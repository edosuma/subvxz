09:45.710 --> 09:47.128
Then sit out this case.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.045
[both] No!

09:48.129 --> 09:49.005
[Bowser] Yes!

09:49.088 --> 09:52.758
As my interns, it is your job to learn.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.303
You can ride along with me,
ask me questions,

09:55.386 --> 09:56.971
but don't touch my radio.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.599
-And no snacks in the car.
-But--

09:59.724 --> 10:02.393
You can chew gum,
but only if you save your wrapper to spit.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.440
For the record, I smashed him 
when he was fun.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.275
You were fun?

10:09.817 --> 10:12.528
[Blair] Okay, I found this article
in the failing  New York Times

10:12.612 --> 10:16.532
called, "Thirty-six Questions 
That Lead to Love."

10:16.616 --> 10:18.034
-[music playing]
-Sweet.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.327
Why?

10:19.410 --> 10:21.621
If you answer the questions 
with your partner,

10:21.704 --> 10:22.997
you gain intimacy.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.790
And then, like, we get to do it.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.250
And then we get to fall in love.

10:27.877 --> 10:28.836
Then we get to do it.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.547
Blair, have I ever told you 
you're the coolest girl in school?

10:32.131 --> 10:33.382
No, you are.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.092
Okay, um...

10:35.843 --> 10:36.677
First question.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.765
What would constitute 
a perfect day for you?

10:42.892 --> 10:43.768
Being with you.

10:43.851 --> 10:44.810
Same.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.397
Oh, my God, it's working.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.774
I like you so much.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.150
[gasps] Mm.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.570
-[Blair] We almost did it.
-[Sterling] But you didn't?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.239
We kissed for a really long time
and then the bell rang.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.242
But his thing was, like,
throbbing on my hip.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.452
It had a heartbeat.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.787
Hey! Would y'all shut up?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.497
Jesus. What the hell?

11:04.955 --> 11:07.208
Sorry, ma'am. Yes, teenagers.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.295
Um, listen, I'd like to just come by
as a general guest.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.089
-You're basically there.
-Yeah, I know.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.632
-[Blair squeals]
-Okay.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.050
No, I got it.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.468
Thank you.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.011
For nothing.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.431
All right, so this is the last address 
Kenneth Chu used.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.892
-An old home?
-Mm-hm.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.520
It's not a residence,
so we don't have legal grounds to enter.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.022
And the home won't 
allow unregistered guests,

11:30.106 --> 11:32.149
so we can't even go in and poke around.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.109
[Blair] That's okay.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.277
Sterling and I can create a diversion

11:35.486 --> 11:36.404
while you sneak in.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.322
She can Irish step dance.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.782
I'm not above flashing.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.909
I'm thinking of something 
that won't get us arrested.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.453
Bounty hunters can get arrested?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.205
Yes.

11:47.957 --> 11:48.916
Now listen to me.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.961
As my interns,
I'm gonna give you an assignment.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.006
This is the bounty hunting equivalent 
of you getting me coffee.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.093
-You ready?
-Yeah.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.220
For you to take time out of your studies

12:01.303 --> 12:03.806
to come read scripture to our folks,
that just warms my heart.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.099
Come on, right this way.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.898
-[chatter]
-[music playing]

12:14.108 --> 12:16.694
Hm. It doesn't smell as old 
as I thought it would.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.783
Hi mister, are you lost?

12:22.867 --> 12:24.285
[grumbles]

12:26.203 --> 12:27.204
You're welcome.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.205
Here you go.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.961
Um... No, thank you.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.338
But old people love coffee.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.175
I don't drink on the job.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.635
Okay? It makes me want 
to go to the bathroom.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.887
You don't drink water?

12:42.970 --> 12:45.055
No. I can self-hydrate.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.641
I'm doing it now.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.437
Mm.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.354
Thank you.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.109
So the receptionist confirmed
that there is no Kenneth Chu here.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.070
But there is a Linda Chu.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.531
Shall we go read the Word of God to her?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.533
Don't say it like that, all sarcastic.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.243
I wasn't being sarcastic.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.248
[woman]  My grandson sends stuff here?

13:11.582 --> 13:13.584
What is it? Porn? Drugs?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.211
According to our sources,

13:15.294 --> 13:17.922
it was Spry toothpaste and a pool float.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.800
What do those items mean to you?

13:20.883 --> 13:23.844
[stammers] Ma'am, when was the last time 
you spoke to him?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.554
I haven't seen him in a year.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.098
Do you know anyone who's kept in touch
with your grandson?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.017
Tookie doesn't have any friends.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.644
All he cares about is money.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.145
I wish he'd send some my way

13:33.229 --> 13:35.147
-so I could upgrade from this dump.
-[groans]

13:35.231 --> 13:38.275
The Nixon Wing is the crappiest one
in this place.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.111
I mean the Reagan Wing, the Truman,

13:41.195 --> 13:42.905
that's where it's at.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.990
Anything but the Lincoln Wing.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.951
That's where they move you

13:47.034 --> 13:49.787
when you're about to 
complete your final act...

13:50.079 --> 13:51.288
Like Miguel there.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.791
Eh, I love you, too.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.292
Asshole.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.670
Okay. Well, thank you very much.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.422
Oh, and they skimp on our toilets too.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.092
-[groans] She was a yapper.
-Yeah.

14:03.175 --> 14:06.095
Although I get where she's coming from.
I know faux granite when I see it.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.639
Yeah, Kenneth Chu
must have a lifeline out there.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.182
Yeah, but how do we find out who that is

14:10.266 --> 14:12.268
if he doesn't have 
a single social media account?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.395
Also, how can you not have a single
social media account?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.980
-Tookie!
-[Bowser] What's a tookie?

14:16.438 --> 14:18.315
She called him, "Tookie."

14:18.399 --> 14:19.233
What?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.318
-[tapping on cell phone]
-[gasps]

14:24.947 --> 14:27.783
Okay, can we just take a second 
to acknowledge how smart I am?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.785
I mean, I really should be 
doing better in school.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.496
Uh-huh. So, he does have a life.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.874
And it looks like this Melissa 
is his piece.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.750
You shouldn't talk about women like that.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.294
She's wearing a scrunchie as a shirt.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.170
But okay, she's the love of his life.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.006
She works at a salon in East Lake.

14:43.757 --> 14:44.592
Wait.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.011
Should we do a stakeout? Please.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.888
-Oh.
-Pretty please, can we do a stakeout?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.098
Okay, Okay,
I'll find out when her shift is,

14:51.181 --> 14:54.518
but this is not a 007
sexy recon mission, nuh-uh.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.312
No. No. No.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.148
This is gonna be you guys, 
without your phones,

14:59.231 --> 15:01.483
doing exactly as I tell you.
Do you understand?

15:02.276 --> 15:05.905
[with accent]
Yes, Sire. Your wish is my wish.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.239
Okay, that was not Russian.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.284
That sounded like Chinese up in there.
What is happening here?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.703
So that's the thing about Ephesians.

15:12.786 --> 15:16.540
It says there should not be 
even a hint of sexual immorality

15:16.624 --> 15:18.500
or any kind of impurity.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.504
Or of greed.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.175
So, if any of you are coveting things
then let's talk about that.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.762
[quiet chatter]

15:29.845 --> 15:31.597
I-- I took my brother's bandana.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.642
Which I guess is stealing, not coveting.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.185
Oh.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.562
Uh, Veronica Lopez debuted 
a new spiral notebook

15:38.646 --> 15:41.106
and for a second, 
I wished that I had bought it first.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.485
Oh, well, the fact that you're,
uh, talking about it

15:44.568 --> 15:46.153
proves that you've already repented.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.571
So, thank you Hannah B.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.200
Mm, and thank you Sterling W.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.618
Let's give her a hand, guys.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.496
This was a great way to start Fellowship.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.289
Oh, we're gonna have
so much fun this year!

15:57.373 --> 15:58.332
Yeah.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.458
And you know what? I was thinking

15:59.541 --> 16:01.585
you should totally just 
use my parking space.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.420
Yes, because I'm scootering these days,

16:03.504 --> 16:04.880
so the curb is fine by me.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.215
Yes, I am. I'm scootering, guys.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.342
Scootering, that's pretty cool, isn't it?

16:09.051 --> 16:11.595
Uh, thank you, but I don't
need any special treatment.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.554
I'm here to minister.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.975
So beloved, let's end with a prayer.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.017
Yes.

16:17.101 --> 16:17.935
Okay.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.315
[breathes deeply]

16:23.399 --> 16:27.987
Dear Lord, please guide us 
as we start our journey in Fellowship.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.198
Awaken us, especially our
brothers and sisters in need,

16:32.366 --> 16:33.409
like April,

16:33.492 --> 16:36.996
no matter when she comes back, 
if at all ever.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.665
Bless her wherever the winds may take her.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.666
[April] Touching.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.335
-[gasps]
-[Sterling] April!

16:43.961 --> 16:45.879
I guess those ble-- blessed winds
brought you back.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.131
What are you doing here?

16:47.214 --> 16:48.382
I had a stomach bug,

16:48.465 --> 16:51.135
which is why I must look
thinner than usual.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.761
-Yeah, I see it.
-Turn to the side, and you're gone.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.348
And I heard there was weird talk
about my dad,

16:56.432 --> 17:00.894
but he left for a long work trip to Tokyo,

17:00.978 --> 17:03.272
so I don't know
where that was coming from.

17:03.814 --> 17:04.648
Why is she back?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.483
Okay, I know you're panicking, 
but there's a bright side.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.651
-Which is?
-She's lying.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.777
-So?
-So?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.195
She doesn't know we turned her dad in.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.572
-Oh.
-See?

17:11.655 --> 17:12.573
So, we just the same everyone else

17:12.656 --> 17:13.741
-and play dumb?
-Absolutely.

17:13.824 --> 17:14.867
Okay. Yeah, I can do that.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.037
The weather in Asia's 
supposed to be really great.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.705
[school bell rings]

17:19.788 --> 17:20.748
Be cool.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.291
-[students chattering]
-Okay.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.711
[whispering] Great job.

17:25.794 --> 17:26.837
Oh, thank you.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.340
I'm really glad that you're 
feeling better, April.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.759
Don't pretend like you care.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.802
There's not a genuine bone in your body.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.140
Unless you're counting Luke's.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.142
Are you preserving that?

17:40.225 --> 17:43.645
I'm not gonna let this thing roll around
in my bag and riddle it with herpes.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.980
What do you want?

17:45.814 --> 17:47.649
What I've always wanted. Your position.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.903
So, resign as Fellowship Leader by Friday,

17:51.528 --> 17:53.614
or this puppy goes wide.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.583
Girls, goodnight.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.418
We are gonna turn in early.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.463
-Chloe's gonna stay with y'all tonight.
-Why? She likes your bed.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.049
Oh, well, we don't want her
watching us... sleep.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.928
[Debbie] Right, because we're turning in 
early to rest and dream.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.221
[Debbie and Anderson chuckle]

18:17.304 --> 18:18.722
Okay. Goodnight.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.893
They are obviously going to bang.

18:23.102 --> 18:23.936
Gross!

18:24.478 --> 18:27.815
At least we saved your eyeballs
from catching on fire. Yes, we did.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.399
[whimpers]

18:31.860 --> 18:32.820
What is wrong?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.613
I'm quitting Fellowship.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.698
Stop. We've been through this.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.368
Yeah, well, maybe I decided that it's 
not worth the fight.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.286
April will be a fine leader.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.496
Are you kidding me?

18:42.746 --> 18:45.541
She'll make it all about herself.
She doesn't care about Christianity.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.417
Well, apparently she cares more than I do

18:47.501 --> 18:49.086
because she's willing to spread
a rumor about me.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.214
I mean, it's not a rumor, but still.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.508
No... A rumor.

18:56.051 --> 18:56.927
That's all it is.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.305
[people shouting]

19:00.389 --> 19:03.225
Hey, did y'all hear what happened 
in Fellowship yesterday?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.060
Someone dropped a condom wrapper.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.020

to slow down our paycheck?

Hm? If I don't get paid,
you don't get paid.

But our parents have been asking about
the money and--

Oh. Well, you tell your parents

25:03.335 --> 25:05.128
that you messed up at work, huh?

but I really wanted to.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.333
Yeah.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.252
It's like this one time 
I was in Drama class

25:45.335 --> 25:47.379
and I was supposed to
laugh at the end of the scene,

25:47.837 --> 25:52.717
but I got so excited
that I laughed through all of the scene

25:53.134 --> 25:54.094
and I got an F.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.345
I feel you.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.014
I messed up my boss' project at work,

25:58.515 --> 26:01.393
but it was only because
I really wanted to finish it.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.728
Of course, you've got passion.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.146
And you've got instincts.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.108
Hey, screw Mr. Pearl for failing you.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.486
Laughing through a scene
can definitely be an arc.

26:12.862 --> 26:16.074
I've just, like, never been able to share
this stuff with a girl before.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.117
Me either.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.286
With a boy.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.247
That's why I feel comfortable 
just being, like...

26:23.206 --> 26:24.207
"I don't like you."

26:24.291 --> 26:26.459
Really? 'Cause, um... I hate you.

Your answers were strange.

You have deeply rooted issues 
with your mom.

26:32.048 --> 26:34.676
And you're going to bone yours... one day.

So, we're breaking up, right?

26:40.348 --> 26:41.808
It already happened, babe.

her fortitude.

In third grade, she held a burp
all through Easter worship.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.492
What do you mean her "fortitude"?

27:01.703 --> 27:02.579
Oh.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.041
Like, the rumor mill
completely passed her by,

27:06.124 --> 27:09.044
even though every other
person got hit with shrapnel.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.504
Yeah. The last one I heard

27:11.588 --> 27:14.841
was that we found the condom and used it.

[chuckling]

27:16.217 --> 27:17.844
I mean, can you even imagine?

27:18.720 --> 27:19.679
I'd rather not, so...

27:20.889 --> 27:22.932
[Hannah B] Well, maybe Sterling is lucky.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.643
Some people in the world just are.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.436
I don't believe in luck.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.693
Need some help?

27:35.111 --> 27:37.238
I miss the days of just "trash."

27:37.322 --> 27:38.198
Right?

27:38.281 --> 27:39.949
There's a bin for everything now.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.744
Paper, glass...

27:44.120 --> 27:45.080
Latex.

27:46.915 --> 27:50.543
Then again,
without some rules and structure...

27:51.211 --> 27:52.379
guiding principles...

27:53.213 --> 27:54.255
it'd be anarchy.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.719
Are we, um...
Are we still talking about trash?

28:02.305 --> 28:04.474
I know you and Sterling have strayed.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.645
And that might be fine 
for heathens and Yankees,

28:08.770 --> 28:11.773
but she's head of fellowship 
and you're captain of the golf team.

28:11.856 --> 28:15.193
If you two aren't walking the walk,

28:16.653 --> 28:18.363
how can you expect anyone else to?

28:19.948 --> 28:21.783
I don't know what-- What are you--

28:21.866 --> 28:23.034
I don't know what you're ta--

28:23.118 --> 28:24.828
I know. I know.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.126
Let me explain.

28:38.967 --> 28:39.884
Unbelievable.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.596
Thank you. I did a sheet mask.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.681
You threatened Luke.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.225
No, I exploited the weak spot.

28:47.642 --> 28:48.935
Like we're taught in Forensics.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.979
We aren't playing for trophies here.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.647
Luke is a person.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.109
A sweet, sensitive person.
He can't handle the pressure.

28:56.192 --> 28:59.404
Which is why
I'll spare outing him and you,

29:00.321 --> 29:01.281
if you resign.

29:01.364 --> 29:02.866
Why are you acting like this?

29:04.367 --> 29:06.035
Is it because of what's going on
with your family?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.204
We go to the same church, 
I know what happened.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.332
What John did is his problem.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.294
-He's still your dad.
-I don't care.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.379
He beat up a prostitute.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.883
I'm not a fan of sex workers, 
but they deserve to be safe.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.761
Just not allowed to vote.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.431
-April--
-What?

29:28.558 --> 29:29.392
I'm sorry.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.738
Resign or pretty boy walks the plank.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.282
And there are sharks in the waters...

29:44.741 --> 29:48.828
and, like, rough coral reef.

29:57.003 --> 29:57.879

30:00.924 --> 30:02.008
Oh.

-Hey, girls.

[clears throat]

30:10.266 --> 30:16.147
Okay, well... um, your father was... 
walking upstairs

30:16.231 --> 30:18.358
and he tweaked his back,

30:18.942 --> 30:22.153
and our heating pad is finally kaput.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.156
Twenty-two years is a good run. [chuckles]

30:25.240 --> 30:28.201
So do you mind going to the drugstore 
and getting him a new one?

30:28.284 --> 30:29.410
We're beat, Mom.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.330
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have asked it like that.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.458
Go to the drugstore and get him a new one.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.377
That's not fair.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.296
Our breadwinner has a seized rhomboid.
Honey, that is not fair.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.716
You know, we had very emotional days

30:43.800 --> 30:45.301
and you didn't even ask about them.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.803
-We worked all week.
-Yeah.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.931
Really? Well, we wouldn't know. 
We haven't seen a penny of your wages.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.641
Oh, we're saving it...

30:52.016 --> 30:54.519
um, so that we can give you
one big payment on Friday.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.312
Mm-hm.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.983
Oh, well, that's responsible

31:00.066 --> 31:02.902
and inspiring and...

31:03.194 --> 31:04.112
I'm proud of you.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.948
And you're still going to the drugstore.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.617
Chop-chop, girls.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.997
[yawns]

31:16.165 --> 31:17.500
-Sad.
-Very.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.879
-Should we tell him?
-He has a right to know.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.006
Those are bad for you, sir.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.507
Yeah, they'll kill you, 
and we're not kidding.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.302
[both] Pastor Booth! Hi!

31:27.385 --> 31:28.761
The Wesley girls.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.180
Always nice to see people out in the wild.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.183
Oh, I know. They're terrible.

31:34.851 --> 31:38.229
Oh, we're just joking
because we knew it was you.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.190
Yeah, we love cigarettes. 
We talk about them all the time.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.817
No need to make me feel better,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.611
I know the dangers of my habit.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.446
What can I say? It's hard to stop.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.531
But The Bible tells us

31:48.615 --> 31:52.076
if we humble ourselves before the Lord,
He will lift us up.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.369
Eventually.

31:53.953 --> 31:54.871
We'll pray for you.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.497
Nah, save your prayers
for those that need them.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.791
This is between me and my maker.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.251
See y'all Sunday.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.169
Mm-hm.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.257
Hi.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.887
$25.39.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.854
Do I look stupid?

32:20.396 --> 32:22.148
It's pretty hard to tell 
just from looking.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.524
These bills are fake.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.902
Don't bring this shit into my store.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.362
Next.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.490
This was the change I got 
from the old folks' home.

32:30.573 --> 32:31.449
[gasps]

32:32.033 --> 32:32.867
Kenneth.

32:33.493 --> 32:37.538
Bowser, the change from the food stand 
at the old folks home is fake.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.207
Kenneth Chu had to have been there.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.166
No, no, wait a minute.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.709
-We already checked.
-But we have proof.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.461
There's counterfeit money in rotation.

32:43.544 --> 32:44.963
All right, maybe we missed something.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.507
You know what?
Meet me out front at the home.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.302
I'm gonna waterboard that Linda Chu lady
with a super fizzy can of Sprite.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.721
Blair, don't you pour no soda 
on that old woman.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.556
-I got a better idea.
-[Blair]  Oh, what is it?

32:56.975 --> 32:59.811
Aww. What is it? I want to know the plan.

33:00.853 --> 33:01.813
We have to text Mom.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.065
Yeah, tell her we're going
to another drugstore.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.734
-[tapping on cell phone]
- We'll need a whole list of alibis.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.027
And aliases.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.947
-[cell phone bleeps]
-"Black Heart." That'll be one of mine.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.407
Bowser said no undercover stuff.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.410
Well, Bowser is a grown man
who can tell the truth to people

33:15.493 --> 33:18.371
about why he's not home right now 
with a new heating pad.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.915
We are going to have to 
make up excuses sometimes.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.668
Don't you think we should tell someone
what we're really doing, though?

33:23.751 --> 33:24.585
Maybe Luke?

33:24.669 --> 33:26.921
In case we end up missing 
or in serious danger?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.339
No. No way.

33:28.756 --> 33:31.467
I mean, we obviously have a gift
for this line of work.

33:31.926 --> 33:32.969
Bowser gets it,

33:33.052 --> 33:34.429
but we can't expect other people to.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.889
This has to remain top secret.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.225
You're right. 
It's like we've been recruited.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.269
The best of the best get recruited.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.312
Like football players, the CIA.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.232
-National Merit Scholars.
-And models!

33:46.816 --> 33:49.277
I do think this whole thing was kind of,
like, meant to be.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.822
I've never been so excited 
about, like, work.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.073
Working.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.366
It's kind of like we found our calling.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.494
Most people don't know what they want
to do with their lives till they're old,

33:58.578 --> 33:59.662
like, twenty-five.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.665
Yeah. What if we become 
the best bounty hunters in Atlanta?

34:02.749 --> 34:03.875
Or the whole state?

34:03.958 --> 34:06.461
-Or the whole country? What's stopping us?
-[chuckles]

34:07.336 --> 34:08.713
I wish we could tell Mom and Dad.

34:08.796 --> 34:11.049
-They'd be so proud.
-But we never will.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.885
This could all go away if people find out.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.762
Yeah, okay, never telling.

34:15.845 --> 34:16.721
Never telling.

No. No. No. No. Hey.

34:26.647 --> 34:27.607

You might have caught my attention

34:35.114 --> 34:36.199
-Mm-mm.
-Good.

All right. Sometimes an intimidating flash
is all you need.
