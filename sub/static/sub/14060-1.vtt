<i>[elizabeth thatcher]:</i>
<i>Perhaps it was hubris</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:17.950
<i>Or just stubborn pride</i>
<i>that set me on my journey west.</i>

00:17.952 --> 00:20.319
<i>My first instinct</i>

00:20.321 --> 00:22.688
<i>Was to refuse the offer</i>
<i>of a teaching post</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.256
<i>In coal valley.</i>

00:24.258 --> 00:26.759
<i>My education certainly</i>
<i>qualified me for the post,</i>

00:26.761 --> 00:28.327
<i>But I feared</i>
<i>my privileged upbringing</i>

00:28.329 --> 00:30.696
<i>Might leave me ill-prepared</i>
<i>and unequipped</i>

00:30.698 --> 00:33.232
<i>To brave the hardships</i>
<i>and dangers out west.</i>

00:38.171 --> 00:41.140
<i>It was my sister, julie,</i>
<i>who bolstered my resolve</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:43.809
<i>Because she so doubted</i>
<i>my fortitude.</i>

00:43.811 --> 00:46.145
<i>She'd tried to frighten me</i>
<i>with tales of cowboys,</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:49.715
<i>Whiskey-runners and outlaws,</i>

00:49.717 --> 00:51.884
<i>But it only emboldened</i>
<i>my determination</i>

00:51.886 --> 00:55.821
<i>To prove to her and my parents</i>
<i>that I am elizabeth thatcher,</i>

00:55.823 --> 01:00.259
<i>A strong, independent,</i>
<i>capable woman.</i>

01:00.261 --> 01:01.994
[yelping in fright]

01:01.996 --> 01:07.866
I can face any obstacle
with courage, grace and dignity.

01:46.372 --> 01:47.840
Hello.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.975
Good afternoon.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.044
I'm elizabeth thatcher.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.679
I'm your new teacher.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.180
Well, hello.

01:55.182 --> 01:57.649
I'm abigail stanton.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.650
Cat montgomery.

01:58.652 --> 02:02.054
Florence blakeley.

02:02.056 --> 02:04.456
We were expecting you
two days ago.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.225
Yes, I'm sorry.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.227
The stagecoach was robbed,

02:08.229 --> 02:09.795
And my belongings
were stolen.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.265
I... I traveled by foot
for hours

02:13.267 --> 02:14.233
Before I was rescued.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.234
Are you all right?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.336
Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.871
Why don't we go somewhere

02:18.873 --> 02:20.973
We can all sit down
and have a nice chat?

02:20.975 --> 02:23.175
Follow me, miss thatcher.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.276
Thank you.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.913
[abigail stanton]:
This teaching post

02:27.915 --> 02:29.214
Is one of the only things

02:29.216 --> 02:31.150
The pacific northwest
mining company

02:31.152 --> 02:32.217
No longer owns.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.719
We mothers decided

02:33.721 --> 02:35.120
To take charge of
our children's education--

02:35.122 --> 02:36.755
Please, sit down.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.357
So we started a school.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.892
Unfortunately,
the church burned,

02:39.894 --> 02:40.959
And the classroom
is currently located

02:40.961 --> 02:42.227
Here in the saloon.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.796
The...

02:44.798 --> 02:46.732
The school is
in the saloon?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.033
It's the only place
big enough

02:48.035 --> 02:49.101
To hold our children,
miss thatcher.

02:49.103 --> 02:51.370
We had requested

02:51.372 --> 02:53.038
A mature,
experienced teacher,

02:53.040 --> 02:55.040
Someone who would not shrink
from the challenges

02:55.042 --> 02:56.542
That coal valley presents.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.278
I realize I'm perhaps
not what you expected,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.346
But I assure you I am acquainted

03:01.348 --> 03:03.215
With the most modern
teaching theories,

03:03.217 --> 03:06.051
The superintendent
of schools did tell you

03:06.053 --> 03:07.085
What happened here?

03:09.055 --> 03:10.355
No, he didn't.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.823
[sighs]

03:13.159 --> 03:14.793
Three months ago,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.295
There was a terrible explosion
in the mine.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.898
47 brave men
lost their lives,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.233
And many of us
lost our husbands

03:21.235 --> 03:23.135
And our sons.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.871
Many of our children
became fatherless that day.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.941
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.209
What she's saying

03:30.211 --> 03:31.510
Is that we don't have
any need for a...

03:31.512 --> 03:32.477
A princess.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.246
I assure you
I am not a--

03:34.248 --> 03:35.514
It would be the mothers

03:35.516 --> 03:36.848
Who are paying
your salary.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.250
For many of us,

03:38.252 --> 03:39.818
Our children are the only thing
we have left,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.286
And, well,

03:41.288 --> 03:43.088
Their education is all
that we have control over,

03:43.090 --> 03:44.823
So whomever

03:44.825 --> 03:46.491
We entrust them to

03:46.493 --> 03:47.926
Must be fearless.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.028
You would not just
be teaching them

03:50.030 --> 03:51.296
To read and write,

03:51.298 --> 03:52.965
You will be fighting
for their future.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.033
<i>"ipsa scientia potestas est."</i>

03:55.035 --> 03:56.768
In latin, that means

03:56.770 --> 03:59.938
"knowledge itself is power."

03:59.940 --> 04:00.939
You need to get back
on the stagecoach

04:00.941 --> 04:02.074
And go back to latin,

04:02.076 --> 04:03.175
Or wherever it is
you come from.

04:03.177 --> 04:06.111
Please, just...
I've come so far.

04:06.113 --> 04:09.781
Just give me a chance
to prove myself to you.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.317
Well, it will take
the stagecoach

04:12.319 --> 04:13.819
One week to return.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.886
We could give her a short try.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.923
In the meantime,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.124
There's a teacherage
where you can stay

04:19.126 --> 04:20.158
And get settled.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.226
Thank you.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.161
Thank you so much.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.998
I promise, I am not afraid
of rolling up my sleeves and--

04:26.000 --> 04:27.065
[screams]

04:27.067 --> 04:29.167
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

04:33.072 --> 04:38.143
Vermin and I are not usually
on such friendly terms.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.879
One week is going to be
a long time.

[wolf howling distantly]

07:40.693 --> 07:43.161
Elizabeth.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.464
You're up early.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.733
I hope you were able to sleep
after what happened last night.

07:48.735 --> 07:52.437
I wanted to apologize
before I left for the school.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.308
I had no idea

07:56.310 --> 07:58.810
My dress was hanging
so close to the fire, and...

07:58.812 --> 08:01.613
And, of course,
I will reimburse the town

08:01.615 --> 08:03.048
For burning down
the teacherage--

08:03.050 --> 08:04.349
Elizabeth,
it's okay.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.219
It was an old building.

08:08.387 --> 08:09.354
[chuckles]

08:11.290 --> 08:12.724
Thank you for taking me in

08:12.726 --> 08:17.262
And for loaning me
these clothes and...

08:17.264 --> 08:20.599
You must think
I'm silly and incompetent.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.468
No.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.704
I know how hard it is
to come to a new place

08:25.706 --> 08:27.272
And find your footing.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.673
When my husband,
noah, and I

08:28.675 --> 08:31.142
First moved to coal valley
with our son, peter,

08:31.144 --> 08:33.445
We were so young.

08:33.447 --> 08:36.748
We didn't know anything.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.518
But we found our way,

08:39.520 --> 08:41.019
And I know
you'll find your way, too.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.689
Thank you for saying that.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.724
That's very kind of you.

08:47.727 --> 08:51.530
Well, I'm off
for my first day of school.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.366
Good luck.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.801
I know the first few days
might be a bit bumpy,

08:56.803 --> 08:58.703
But I have
every confidence in you.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.805
Thank you.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.425
I'm a qualified teacher.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.160
I trained at
one of the best colleges.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.828
I can do this.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.730
I can absolutely do this.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.336
My rosaleen can't see
the blackboard

09:31.338 --> 09:32.604
If she's in the back.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.672
She needs to be
in the front.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.240
Oh, uh, that's fine.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.744
My boy's a whiz with numbers,
but can't spell a lick.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.745
My mama says
she's glad you're here.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.614
I'm glad to be here, too.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.815
Morning.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.749
Good morning.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.418
I got cheese for lunch.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.385
Oh, I like cheese.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.189
You give out
schoolwork for home?

09:51.191 --> 09:52.591
Uh, I hadn't--

09:52.593 --> 09:53.758
I think work should be done
in class

09:53.760 --> 09:54.960
And not at my supper table.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.761
We're paying
your salary, you know?

09:56.763 --> 09:57.862
Yes, well, I plan to--

09:57.864 --> 09:59.164
I want my son
to be smart

09:59.166 --> 10:00.899
So he don't have to work
in no coal mine.

10:00.901 --> 10:01.900
You hear me?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.435
Ladies, ladies, please,

10:03.437 --> 10:05.804
Let's give miss thatcher
a little breathing room.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.405
We should feel blessed

10:07.407 --> 10:10.442
That she has come this far
to teach our children

10:10.444 --> 10:13.578
In these less than ideal
circumstances.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.850
"whoso neglects learning
in his youth

10:18.852 --> 10:21.353
Loses the past
and is dead to the future."

10:27.326 --> 10:28.393
I was quoting euripides.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.197
I... [clears throat]

10:32.199 --> 10:33.098
I'm sorry, I just need a drink.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.735
Not a drink-drink...

10:36.737 --> 10:37.669
I don't drink.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.674
Good day.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.486
I'd like to talk about
what I expect from you <i>.</i>

10:54.488 --> 10:55.820
I expect you

10:55.822 --> 10:57.789
To pay attention
when I'm speaking.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.226
I expect you
to raise your hand

11:01.228 --> 11:03.328
When you would like to speak.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.597
Please don't leave your seats
without asking, and please--

11:05.599 --> 11:07.565
[distant whistle blows]

11:07.567 --> 11:08.700
--Please, don't talk
while I am--

11:10.302 --> 11:11.269
Children, wait!

11:11.271 --> 11:12.971
You didn't ask for permission!

11:12.973 --> 11:13.938
Oh!

11:13.940 --> 11:15.573
Sit down, please.
Stop!

11:15.575 --> 11:16.675
You're already
breaking my rules!

11:16.677 --> 11:18.276
I'm warning you, everyone

11:18.278 --> 11:19.377
Who leaves this classroom
without permission--

11:19.379 --> 11:20.612
Miss thatcher?

11:20.614 --> 11:21.813
--A written notice
to their parents.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.747
Miss thatcher?

11:22.749 --> 11:23.948
Yes. What is it?

11:23.950 --> 11:27.719
I'm rachel
and no disrespect,

11:27.721 --> 11:28.787
But you shouldn't try
and stop 'em.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.455
And why is that?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.657
The whistle is from the mine.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.427
It means some more of
the daddies have been found.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.328
-Found?
-Yes, ma'am.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.331
Now their folks can take 'em
and bury 'em proper.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.769
[distant whistle blows]

11:57.850 --> 11:59.651
Everyone, follow me.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.357
Neighbors,

12:06.359 --> 12:10.662
We have done
what we promised.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.797
Today, we dug out
the last of the lost men.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.766
Now, I know that
these past few months

12:14.768 --> 12:18.403
Have left us
all feeling like--

12:18.405 --> 12:20.572
Well, like, there ain't
nothing right in this world.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.109
But besides finding

12:24.111 --> 12:25.710
The brave men
who lost their lives,

12:25.712 --> 12:27.312
We found something else today.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.416
And I hope it'll bring comfort

12:31.418 --> 12:32.751
To at least one
coal valley family.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.857
[murmurs and gasps from crowd]

12:38.859 --> 12:42.560
What's it say, teacher?

12:42.562 --> 12:44.696
"forgive me, pa."

12:53.472 --> 12:55.707
Ladies, I promise

12:55.709 --> 12:59.978
That I'll take good care
of this plank

12:59.980 --> 13:02.714
Until it's decided
what we're going to do with it.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.415
The miner, one of our own--

13:04.417 --> 13:06.050
Spent his last minutes

13:06.052 --> 13:08.086
On this earth

13:08.088 --> 13:12.423
Writing those words
to his family.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.825
We should be the ones
who decides where it goes.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.527
[crowd murmuring in agreement]

13:19.765 --> 13:21.399
I'm going back to my office, mr.
Spurlock.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.543
Kindly step aside,
mr. Palmer.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.344
This ain't your decision,
mr. Gowen.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.880
This is a matter

13:35.882 --> 13:38.049
For the miners
and the widows to decide,

13:38.051 --> 13:39.851
And you're neither, sir.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.920
Step aside now, mr. Palmer.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.888
Or what?

13:43.890 --> 13:45.723
Or you'll run me down?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.826
Is that what you want,
mr. Gowen, huh?

13:47.828 --> 13:50.061
One more dead miner!

13:50.063 --> 13:51.930
Break it up.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.965
Move back.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.533
Who is that, miss thatcher?

13:55.535 --> 13:56.501
That's a mountie.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.209
Sir?

14:04.211 --> 14:05.844
Would you like to tell me
what's behind this commotion?

14:07.112 --> 14:09.047
We had a mine disaster
in this town recently.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.481
I'm aware of that.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.751
Today...

14:13.753 --> 14:15.620
This was found,

14:15.622 --> 14:16.788
But the identity

14:16.790 --> 14:18.823
Of the deceased miner
who wrote it

14:18.825 --> 14:20.425
Is unclear.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.759
Now, understandably,

14:21.761 --> 14:23.394
Everyone is
very emotional about it...

14:25.865 --> 14:27.498
But this a distraction
that we can ill afford.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.002
No one is gonna be
thinking about that job

14:31.004 --> 14:32.737
Until we find the owner
of that message.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.039
There is no reason why both
can't happen at the same time.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.945
Folks, the only fair way
to judge who should have it

14:40.947 --> 14:42.747
Is for all the widows

14:42.749 --> 14:44.082
To submit a sample
of their husband's writing

14:44.084 --> 14:46.584
To mr. Gowen as evidence.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.487
I'm sure he can come
to a decision in three days.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.590
And who might you be,
young man?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.125
Name is jack thornton.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.462
I'm the new constable
of coal valley.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.878
"baskets contain..."

15:16.649 --> 15:19.884
Oh. Hello.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.586
I didn't know
anyone else was here.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.987
Good morning.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.923
I'm staying in
one of the rooms upstairs

15:24.925 --> 15:28.593
Until something more permanent
can be arranged.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.263
I'm elizabeth thatcher,
I'm the new teacher here,

15:32.265 --> 15:33.665
But I guess you've probably
already gathered that.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.634
Constable jack thornton,

15:36.636 --> 15:37.969
But I guess

15:37.971 --> 15:40.104
You've already
gathered that.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.006
I'm sorry.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.908
I'm afraid I may have left you
with some of my chalk dust.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.144
No. No chalk dust.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.946
Now I feel cheated.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.582
I have to say
I'm a little surprised

15:51.584 --> 15:53.918
That coal valley merits
a full-time mountie.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.654
That makes two of us.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.756
My original posting
was in cape fullerton,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.058
But that suddenly changed.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.960
Oh.

16:01.962 --> 16:02.894
I imagine coal valley will be
a little quieter for you

16:02.896 --> 16:03.995
Than a busy shipping port

16:03.997 --> 16:06.564
Like that.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.532
Wait,

16:07.534 --> 16:08.700
You know the place?

16:08.702 --> 16:10.068
Very well.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.202
My father has done business
in cape fullerton

16:11.204 --> 16:12.203
For many years.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.538
And what's your father's name?

16:13.540 --> 16:15.073
William thatcher.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.976
William thatcher
the shipping tycoon?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.877
Well, I don't
think of him that way,

16:19.879 --> 16:20.878
But, yes, I suppose he is.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.549
Now it's all making sense.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.184
What is?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.986
Miss thatcher,

16:27.988 --> 16:30.088
A week ago,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.889
I had never even
heard of coal valley,

16:31.891 --> 16:33.791
And while I was planning my trip
to cape fullerton,

16:33.793 --> 16:35.860
I was told
I was being reassigned here,

16:35.862 --> 16:38.229
Reassigned at the request
of a very powerful man.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.632
Surely, you don't think that--

16:41.634 --> 16:43.134
What, that a very
wealthy man's daughter

16:43.136 --> 16:45.103
Might be why I now
have to eat coal dust

16:45.105 --> 16:47.372
For the next
god knows how long?

16:47.374 --> 16:48.806
I'm absolutely sure
that's why I'm here,

16:48.808 --> 16:50.341
To keep
william thatcher's princess

16:50.343 --> 16:52.076
From stubbing her toe

16:52.078 --> 16:53.811
In a town she had
no business coming to.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.246
To be candid, sir,

16:55.248 --> 16:56.881
I think you're way off-base
with that remark,

16:56.883 --> 16:58.649
And just so we're clear,

16:58.651 --> 17:00.151
Even if my father did
pull strings to get you here,

17:00.153 --> 17:01.886
I don't need you.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.121
I can take care
of my own stubbed toes,

17:03.123 --> 17:04.188
Thank you very much.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.791
You know, on second thought,

17:06.793 --> 17:09.027
It's obvious I won't
have to be here long,

17:09.029 --> 17:11.996
Because you won't last a month
in a town like this.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.899
Well, constable thornton,
I think you'd better settle in

17:14.901 --> 17:17.235
And get used to a steady diet
of coal dust.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.170
I'm a thatcher.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.773
We don't run from a challenge.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.274
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:23.276 --> 17:26.110
I have reading materials
to prepare for my students.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.246
Good day to you, sir.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.009
"therefore,

17:58.011 --> 17:59.310
"I am strongly requesting
an immediate transfer

17:59.312 --> 18:01.245
"to a new post.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.782
Salutations,
constable jack thornton."

18:06.685 --> 18:08.886
If that's it,

18:08.888 --> 18:11.589
I will get this sent
right away, constable.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.173
"safety violation..."

18:32.344 --> 18:34.145
[door opens]

18:38.383 --> 18:41.252
You compare his signature
on our marriage license

18:41.254 --> 18:42.720
To that piece of wood,

18:42.722 --> 18:44.255
And you'll see
it's the same writing.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.827
I was asleep when he left
for the mine that day.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.264
That board is his goodbye
to me and my children.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.235
Thank you.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.136
I'll consider it,
mrs. Crocker.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.773
Next!

19:07.346 --> 19:09.380
Good morning,
mrs. Montgomery.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.849
My joseph left
little notes like that

19:11.851 --> 19:13.317
All the time.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.585
He would be working nights

19:14.587 --> 19:16.254
And I would find them
by the ice box,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.756
Or on my pillow.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.926
It makes sense to me

19:21.928 --> 19:26.063
That, well, he'd leave
one last note for us.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.367
I'll let you know.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.368
Thank you.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.170
Next!

19:59.331 --> 20:01.999
Who can identify
this part of speech?

20:07.172 --> 20:09.140
Is it a noun?

20:11.243 --> 20:12.443
A verb?

20:17.349 --> 20:19.116
Anyone?

20:20.485 --> 20:21.719
[sighs]

20:21.721 --> 20:22.753
It's a verb.

20:26.992 --> 20:31.562
All right, boys and girls,
listen up,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.898
May I have
your attention, please?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.766
I'd like to see
all of your eyes.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.137
Your parents have charged me
with giving you an education,

20:40.139 --> 20:44.141
So you can become
anything you wish.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.010
Maybe a doctor,

20:46.012 --> 20:47.812
Or a dentist...

20:47.814 --> 20:49.080
You're dead wrong.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.414
Boys, remember the rules.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.816
No talking
while I'm talking.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.317
Is too!
Ma says my pappy wrote it.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.286
Boys, you're not
listening to me.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.721
Take it back!

20:56.723 --> 20:57.755
Stop it!

20:57.757 --> 20:59.824
Stop it this minute!

20:59.826 --> 21:02.226
[kids shout encouragements]

21:02.228 --> 21:03.961
Boys, stop it!

21:03.963 --> 21:05.863
[yelps]

21:05.865 --> 21:07.198
[class falls silent]

21:13.105 --> 21:14.839
[whimpers]

21:17.342 --> 21:20.278
Ah, elizabeth,
just in time for dinner.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.979
Would you mind
setting the table for three?

21:23.482 --> 21:25.016
Remember how you said

21:25.018 --> 21:29.854
The first few days
might be a little bumpy?

21:29.856 --> 21:31.355
Well, you were right.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.325
Oh.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.426
Black and blue, too,
it appears.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.895
What happened?

21:37.897 --> 21:40.665
Some boys got in a tussle
over the message on the wood.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.067
I stepped in the middle
and caught the worst of it.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.002
Never step between
two coal boys

21:45.004 --> 21:45.970
When they're mixing it up.

21:47.572 --> 21:49.273
[sighing]

21:51.043 --> 21:53.277
I need to get them
interested in their lessons,

21:53.279 --> 21:54.645
But I've never been through

21:54.647 --> 21:57.381
Anything like what they've been
through before

21:57.383 --> 21:59.283
And I don't know
how to help them.

21:59.285 --> 22:03.087
When my peter was little,
I was the only teacher he had.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.722
He was so bored
during his lessons,

22:04.724 --> 22:08.092
Sometimes, he would nod off
like an old man in a rocker.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.894
[chuckling]

22:09.896 --> 22:11.095
So, what did you do?

22:12.230 --> 22:13.564
Levity.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.533
I added a little levity

22:15.535 --> 22:17.335
To the learning.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.136
Levity...

22:19.138 --> 22:20.638
[knock on door]

22:20.640 --> 22:21.906
Would you mind?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.849
You.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.917
You?

22:32.919 --> 22:34.518
Nice shiner.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.988
It's my first, actually,
but I think I earned it.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.490
Got those bags packed yet?

22:39.492 --> 22:41.258
Why?

22:41.260 --> 22:42.526
Had your fill
of coal dust already?

22:42.528 --> 22:43.961
Good evening, constable.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.329
Evening, mrs. Stanton.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.397
We're glad you could
make supper

22:46.399 --> 22:47.965
On short notice.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.166
To tell you the truth,

22:49.168 --> 22:51.535
I'm not too popular
in town yet.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.137
Supper invitations
aren't exactly pouring in.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.439
Well, we're very happy
to have you here,

22:55.441 --> 22:56.574
Aren't we, elizabeth?

22:56.576 --> 23:00.111
"happy" isn't
the word for it.

23:10.922 --> 23:11.956
Do you like it?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.257
Very much, ma'am.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.626
The artist has
a wonderful grasp of color

23:15.628 --> 23:17.528
And composition.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.096
You know art,
do you?

23:19.098 --> 23:20.197
A little.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.565
My mother taught me

23:21.567 --> 23:23.401
To appreciate different
techniques and subjects.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.403
Is she an artist herself?

23:25.405 --> 23:27.037
No.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.005
A teacher.

23:29.441 --> 23:31.175
A most honorable
profession.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.311
In any event,
a very talented artist.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.046
Was...

23:38.617 --> 23:42.186
My late husband,
god rest his soul.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.060
"noah stanton."

23:54.466 --> 23:56.133
Mm.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.103
So, constable,
why the mounties?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.304
Yes, constable,

24:00.306 --> 24:01.539
Please tell us why
someone like yourself

24:01.541 --> 24:02.773
Chose such
an honorable profession.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.276
And while
we're at it,

24:05.278 --> 24:06.310
How did you come to be
in coal valley?

24:07.479 --> 24:09.980
Why don't you
answer that question?

24:10.749 --> 24:13.150
I'm sure I wouldn't know.

24:14.586 --> 24:15.653
In that case, just lucky,

24:15.655 --> 24:17.321
I guess.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.722
But as to
being a mountie,

24:18.724 --> 24:20.391
That is in my blood.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.293
My father made a career
of being a peace officer,

24:22.295 --> 24:23.828
And my mother told me

24:23.830 --> 24:26.564
Never let a day go by
without serving somebody else.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.265
My son, peter,

24:28.267 --> 24:29.633
Considered joining
the royal northwest mounties,

24:29.635 --> 24:32.102
But his father convinced him

24:32.104 --> 24:34.672
That coal mining was also
a noble profession.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.739
It is, ma'am.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.208
One of the noblest.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.346
I'm so sorry for your loss.

24:44.382 --> 24:46.517
I can't imagine

24:46.519 --> 24:48.085
How hard it must have been
for you

24:48.087 --> 24:49.620
To have them both
go into that mine every day.

24:49.622 --> 24:52.423
Well, most days, I didn't think
about it, you know?

24:52.425 --> 24:54.158
I just went about my business,

24:54.160 --> 24:56.427
And I pretended I didn't know
what they were doing,

24:56.429 --> 24:59.797
Or how deep into
that mountain they really were.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.733
And then their shift would end,

25:02.735 --> 25:04.101
And in they'd come,

25:04.103 --> 25:06.370
Sometimes laughing,
sometimes grousing,

25:06.372 --> 25:08.405
Always covered
in that coal dust.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.508
Did they ever talk about
the danger?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.577
He didn't need to.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.381
It's an unspoken contract

25:17.383 --> 25:20.451
That every coal miner makes
between himself and his family.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.524
Mrs. Stanton,

25:26.526 --> 25:27.558
Can you tell me
what you remember

25:27.560 --> 25:28.926
About the day of the explosion?

25:28.928 --> 25:31.095
I'm sure mrs. Stanton
doesn't want to discuss

25:31.097 --> 25:32.329
That subject now.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.597
It's okay, elizabeth.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.699
I don't mind.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.272
I remember...

25:41.274 --> 25:44.041
Everything.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.445
The explosion was so loud,

25:48.447 --> 25:50.214
It shattered windows
and rattled the whole house.

25:50.216 --> 25:55.152
Then it dawned on me
what had happened.

25:55.154 --> 25:58.756
No one said a word.

25:58.758 --> 26:03.227
We didn't need to.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.764
All we could think to do
was run.

26:06.766 --> 26:10.301
There are no words
for what we felt,

26:10.303 --> 26:14.505
What was in our hearts.

26:17.275 --> 26:21.078
But they never came home.

26:24.883 --> 26:27.217
Thank you so much
for coming, constable.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.286
Was it really necessary

26:29.288 --> 26:30.854
To make her relive
the worst day of her life?

26:30.856 --> 26:32.556
I'm inquisitive.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.358
I gather information,
it's part of who I am.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.759
It's insensitive,

26:35.761 --> 26:37.561
But, apparently,
that's part of who you are, too.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.296
You won't have to
deal with me for very long.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.265
I put in a transfer request,

26:41.267 --> 26:42.700
And I am hoping for
a quick response.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.301
Good,

26:44.303 --> 26:45.669
Because this town does not
require the services

26:45.671 --> 26:47.871
Of a second-rate mountie
who runs from a challenge.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.874
I hardly consider
this town a challenge.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.409
Really?

26:52.411 --> 26:53.844
It seems to me

26:53.846 --> 26:55.379
That a town whose church
burns to the ground,

26:55.381 --> 26:56.513
And whose mine explodes,

26:56.515 --> 26:57.781
Killing half
the town's population,

26:57.783 --> 27:00.384
Wouldn't warrant
investigation.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.518
In the short time

27:01.520 --> 27:02.653
That I am forced
to stay here,

27:02.655 --> 27:03.787
Miss thatcher,

27:03.789 --> 27:05.356
I fully intend
to investigate

27:05.358 --> 27:08.492
All suspicious events
that have taken place,

27:08.494 --> 27:12.229
Which is why I was
asking questions tonight.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.931
So you think
you can see something

27:13.933 --> 27:15.733
Or talk to someone
for a few moments

27:15.735 --> 27:17.968
And deduce
all sorts of facts

27:17.970 --> 27:19.470
That everyone else
has missed?

27:19.472 --> 27:20.904
Sometimes.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.040
How clever.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.676
I knew after just two minutes
of talking to you

27:25.678 --> 27:27.411
That you weren't wearing
your own shoes or dress,

27:27.413 --> 27:28.746
And that
you weren't disappointed

27:28.748 --> 27:29.647
When you found out
I was coming to dinner.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.715
How could you know that?

27:31.717 --> 27:34.018
You're walking
on the outside of your feet

27:34.020 --> 27:35.619
To compensate
for your shoes pinching,

27:35.621 --> 27:37.855
And your dress
is three inches too short

27:37.857 --> 27:38.889
And a little tight
around the waist.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.724
[gasps in shock]

27:40.726 --> 27:41.925
And not being disappointed
about seeing you at dinner?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.364
That was just a guess.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.667
How dare you.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.269
I never.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.907
[♪]

28:03.648 --> 28:05.249
[sighs]

28:08.687 --> 28:09.953
[chuckles ruefully]

28:57.769 --> 28:59.403
Shouldn't you be
in school, son?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.405
I'm not your son.

29:04.642 --> 29:05.743
I'm just walking.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.144
It's not a crime
to walk, is it?

29:07.146 --> 29:08.846
No, but truancy
is a crime, young man.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.647
Gabe!

29:10.649 --> 29:12.683
There you are.

29:12.685 --> 29:14.151
This boy should be
in class.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.919
Tell me, do you normally
allow your students

29:15.921 --> 29:17.521
To wander around the streets
during school hours?

29:17.523 --> 29:18.455
Gabe was running
an errand for me,

29:18.457 --> 29:20.557
If you must know.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.026
An errand?

29:23.028 --> 29:24.027
Yes.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.095
School business.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.063
Thank you

29:26.065 --> 29:27.364
For your concern, constable,

29:27.366 --> 29:28.899
But we are perfectly fine.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.669
Thanks.

29:32.671 --> 29:33.937
You left
to use the outhouse

29:33.939 --> 29:34.905
Half an hour ago.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.039
I was worried
about you.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.040
No need
to worry about me.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.408
I can take care
of myself.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.710
Well, during
school hours,

29:39.712 --> 29:41.078
I expect you to stay
in the classroom,

29:41.080 --> 29:42.780
Unless you have
permission to leave.

29:42.782 --> 29:43.914
School
doesn't matter!

29:43.916 --> 29:46.416
Nothing matters
anymore.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.417
Gabe.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.286
Gabe, come back here!

29:52.757 --> 29:54.992
[reverend]: Eternal god,

29:54.994 --> 29:58.562
Our hope
in every time of trouble,

29:58.564 --> 30:01.064
Send thy holy spirit
to comfort

30:01.066 --> 30:04.668
And strengthen us

30:04.670 --> 30:08.005
That we may have hope
of life eternal

30:08.007 --> 30:11.475
And trust in your goodness

30:11.477 --> 30:14.144
And mercy.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.614
Please take a moment
of silence

30:17.616 --> 30:20.751
To remember your loved ones.

30:33.665 --> 30:37.935
[door opens and closes]

30:37.937 --> 30:39.636
[footsteps approach]

30:47.779 --> 30:50.681
When did you notice
the plank was gone?

30:50.683 --> 30:51.915
When I got back
from the funeral.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.587
Anything else taken?

30:56.589 --> 30:59.423
Not that I can tell,

30:59.425 --> 31:00.958
But seeing as

31:00.960 --> 31:03.827
You started with
the ticking clock

31:03.829 --> 31:05.062
For me to find out

31:05.064 --> 31:06.763
The true owner
of the message,

31:06.765 --> 31:09.533
You'd better get out there
and find out where it went.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.201
Just so we're clear,
mr. Gowen,

31:11.203 --> 31:12.369
I work for
all the people in coal valley.

31:13.805 --> 31:14.838
I'm not a miner,

31:14.840 --> 31:15.973
And I'm not on your payroll,

31:15.975 --> 31:16.874
So I don't take my orders
from you.

31:18.509 --> 31:22.145
Does "all the people"
include me?

31:22.147 --> 31:23.747
Of course.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.649
Then I would appreciate
your presence

31:25.651 --> 31:26.850
When I have to
tell the townsfolk

31:26.852 --> 31:28.018
That the plank has gone missing.

31:30.588 --> 31:32.489
I'll see what I can find out.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.524
You should start
with that rabble rouser,

31:34.526 --> 31:35.893
Franklin palmer.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.527
If I didn't need
every able-bodied man

31:37.529 --> 31:38.795
That I can get
right now,

31:38.797 --> 31:41.164
I would have fired him
on the spot

31:41.166 --> 31:42.799
For challenging me
in front of everyone.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.835
Palmer's not your man.

31:46.204 --> 31:47.938
I saw him
at the funeral.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.908
Now I'm going to make the rounds
and figure out who wasn't there.

31:53.511 --> 31:55.979
[♪]

32:16.734 --> 32:18.936
So I thought if I got
to know a little more

32:18.938 --> 32:20.170
About your son,

32:20.172 --> 32:22.839
I might be better equipped
to understand

32:22.841 --> 32:24.908
Where this behavior
is coming from.

32:24.910 --> 32:25.876
Fighting?

32:25.878 --> 32:26.910
Disrespectful?

32:26.912 --> 32:27.844
Gabe?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.148
Don't tell me he hit you!

32:31.150 --> 32:32.749
What?

32:32.751 --> 32:34.451
Oh. No, no, that's, um...

32:34.453 --> 32:35.852
I was a little clumsy.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.090
What can you tell me

32:40.092 --> 32:41.725
About gabe's relationship
with his father?

32:42.827 --> 32:45.495
Joseph?

32:45.497 --> 32:46.463
Well, he was a wonderful man.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.233
Gabe adored him.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.937
Idolized him even.

32:53.939 --> 32:55.839
I think it made joe
uncomfortable.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.808
How so?

32:59.510 --> 33:02.679
Well, he knew that, one day,

33:02.681 --> 33:07.217
Gabe would wake up
and see him as he really is--

33:07.219 --> 33:08.452
Was--

33:11.022 --> 33:11.922
Just a man.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.224
[knock on door]

33:16.060 --> 33:17.527
Would you like me
to get that?

33:17.529 --> 33:19.463
Yes, please.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.401
[together]: You.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.536
Invite yourself to somebody
else's home for dinner

33:26.538 --> 33:27.771
So you can ask

33:27.773 --> 33:28.905
All sorts of
insensitive questions?

33:28.907 --> 33:29.906
[mrs. Montgomery]:
Constable?

33:29.908 --> 33:32.209
What can I do for you?

33:32.211 --> 33:33.844
I'm making the rounds,

33:33.846 --> 33:35.178
Letting folks know
that I'm here to serve, ma'am.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.947
Oh, well,
that's comforting.

33:36.949 --> 33:38.615
Thank you.

33:38.617 --> 33:39.783
This is my daughter, emily.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.251
Hi.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.853
Thank you for introducing
yourself, constable.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.154
Ma'am.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.155
Children, get
washed up for dinner.

33:50.995 --> 33:52.662
[bell rings]

33:52.664 --> 33:54.197
Students,

33:54.199 --> 33:56.266
Please bring your slates,
chalk and rags up to my desk,

33:56.268 --> 33:57.267
And then you are dismissed.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.770
Thank you. Thank you...

34:00.838 --> 34:01.638
Thank you.

35:14.245 --> 35:16.146
What are you
doing here?

35:16.148 --> 35:17.147
What are you doing here?

35:17.149 --> 35:18.181
I'm following him.

35:18.183 --> 35:19.216
Me, too.

35:20.218 --> 35:21.218
How did you know?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.119
Know what?

35:22.121 --> 35:23.086
That he's the one.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.187
The one what?

35:25.723 --> 35:26.656
You don't know,

35:26.658 --> 35:27.858
Do you?

35:27.860 --> 35:28.959
Of course, I know.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.827
You don't know
why you're here,

35:30.829 --> 35:32.095
In many ways.

35:32.097 --> 35:33.763
I am here because
I had an instinct

35:33.765 --> 35:34.998
That gabe was
going somewhere

35:35.000 --> 35:35.932
That he didn't want anyone
to know about,

35:35.934 --> 35:36.967
And that he might need help.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.302
Yes. Help.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.104
He seemed troubled.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.273
"instinct" is for mounties,
not for teachers.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.208
Let me handle this.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.378
"students" are for teachers,
not mounties.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.651
Fair enough.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.286
We'll do this together.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.755
Whatever it is
we're doing.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.091
We'll find out
in just a minute.

36:14.205 --> 36:15.172
What do you want?

36:15.174 --> 36:16.439
Is that the plank?

36:16.441 --> 36:19.176
It's mine.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.944
You stole it from
mr. Gowen's office,

36:20.946 --> 36:22.846
Didn't you?

36:22.848 --> 36:25.415
It ain't stealin' if
it's yours in the first place.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.861
You must miss him very much.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.830
Please let me keep it.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.899
I just know it's from him.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.801
It's not that simple.

36:46.337 --> 36:47.337
If you were
so sure, gabe,

36:47.339 --> 36:48.872
Why didn't you wait

36:48.874 --> 36:49.606
For mr. Gowen
to give it to your family?

36:49.608 --> 36:51.775
Pa never trusted gowen.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.377
I heard him tell ma

36:54.379 --> 36:55.745
That he never did
the right thing.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.882
That's why I had to take it.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.385
I know he wrote it for me.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.120
He had to write for me.

37:07.258 --> 37:10.927
Sometimes, people die
without "I love you's"

37:10.929 --> 37:13.163
And "I forgive you's."

37:13.165 --> 37:14.564
But just because that happens,

37:14.566 --> 37:16.032
It doesn't mean
they wouldn't have said it

37:16.034 --> 37:18.401
If they could have.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.906
I know who did manage
to say it before he died.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.275
It's time
to tell his wife.

37:29.780 --> 37:30.914
Abigail?

37:30.916 --> 37:33.183
Yes, elizabeth?

37:33.185 --> 37:35.819
Constable?

37:35.821 --> 37:37.120
Gabe?

37:39.323 --> 37:40.523
I don't understand.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.259
They say this is yours.

37:46.230 --> 37:47.831
Yes.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.199
I know it is.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.169
You've known all along,
haven't you?

37:56.407 --> 37:58.875
Then why didn't you
try to claim it?

37:58.877 --> 38:00.644
I think
you did want it,

38:00.646 --> 38:01.645
But you were worried
it would cause a rift

38:01.647 --> 38:03.146
Between you
and the other women.

38:03.148 --> 38:07.984
I knew it would
set me apart from them

38:07.986 --> 38:09.819
If I had something meaningful
to remember my noah by,

38:09.821 --> 38:10.887
And they didn't.

38:20.531 --> 38:21.598
I'm sorry,
mrs. Stanton.

38:21.600 --> 38:26.469
I shouldn't have taken it.

38:37.214 --> 38:39.849
Thank you, gabe.

38:46.424 --> 38:49.025
It's okay, gabe.

38:50.127 --> 38:51.828
It's okay.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.936
There's one more thing
that you and I need to do.

39:01.205 --> 39:05.108
And your next word
is "territory."

39:06.644 --> 39:08.478
"terri-

39:08.480 --> 39:10.847
Tory..."

39:19.390 --> 39:21.658
[♪]

39:43.581 --> 39:44.481
[♪]

39:47.651 --> 39:49.285
<i>[elizabeth, writing]:</i>
<i>In closing,</i>

39:49.287 --> 39:51.121
<i>I hope I've conveyed</i>

39:51.123 --> 39:52.655
<i>That despite the hardships</i>
<i>I experienced coming here,</i>

39:52.657 --> 39:54.724
<i>I am for want of nothing.</i>

39:54.726 --> 39:57.327
<i>I am standing strong</i>
<i>on my own two feet,</i>

39:57.329 --> 39:58.428
<i>A proud thatcher,</i>

39:58.430 --> 40:00.163
<i>Just like you raised.</i>

40:00.165 --> 40:02.198
<i>Your loving daughter,</i>
<i>elizabeth.</i>

40:04.635 --> 40:07.103
<i>Postscript,</i>

40:07.105 --> 40:08.605
<i>I would, however, mention</i>

40:08.607 --> 40:09.439
<i>That they have me teaching</i>
<i>the children here</i>

40:09.441 --> 40:11.508
<i>In an actual saloon,</i>

40:11.510 --> 40:13.276
<i>So school supplies,</i>

40:13.278 --> 40:14.978
<i>Or anything of cultural value</i>
<i>you could send me,</i>

40:14.980 --> 40:17.414
<i>I would be eternally grateful.</i>

40:21.152 --> 40:22.318
Good afternoon, miss thatcher.

40:22.320 --> 40:25.188
Afternoon, constable thornton.

40:30.027 --> 40:33.129
Do you think that we could
dispense with the "constable,"

40:33.131 --> 40:36.099
And could I persuade you
to just call me "jack?"

40:36.101 --> 40:37.801
Does your request mean
you've come to the conclusion

40:37.803 --> 40:40.069
That you'll be here
a good, long while?

40:40.071 --> 40:43.540
Not at all.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.975
Making it a week is hardly
the test of time, now, is it?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.544
[chuckles mirthlessly]

40:47.546 --> 40:49.312
I concur with
your assessment of time...

40:50.948 --> 40:54.017
However, I still disagree
with your assessment of me.

40:54.019 --> 40:57.720
We will be here
a good, long while,

40:57.722 --> 40:59.422
Therefore you may
call me elizabeth.

41:00.724 --> 41:01.958
Fine.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.560
Elizabeth, it is.

41:03.562 --> 41:06.196
Have yourself a good day,

41:06.198 --> 41:07.931
Jack.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.739
<i>Post-postscript.</i>

41:16.741 --> 41:18.608
<i>Please greet</i>
<i>my younger sister for me</i>

41:18.610 --> 41:21.177
<i>And pass along that I've yet</i>
<i>to see any whiskey-runners,</i>

41:21.179 --> 41:24.714
<i>However, I have run into</i>
<i>some cowboys, outlaws</i>

41:24.716 --> 41:28.384
<i>And one very handsome,</i>
<i>annoying mountie.</i>

41:37.828 --> 41:41.931
