WEBVTT

00:01.711 --> 00:03.463
- Get up.
- I apologised.

00:03.630 --> 00:04.672
I tried to explain.

00:04.714 --> 00:06.299
- What do you want from me?
- Get up!

00:06.341 --> 00:07.884
- Pete, stop.
- Get on your feet!

00:07.926 --> 00:09.052
- Stop.
- I don't wanna get up.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.054
- Stop.
- He stole my name.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.597
- Yeah, I know, but--
- He stole my family.

00:12.639 --> 00:14.641
I know,
but I still don't want you to hit him.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.975
Why are you sticking up for him?

00:16.017 --> 00:17.977
I'm not.
It's just we need him.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.646
- No, we don't.
- Yes, you do.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.105
You shut the fuck up!

00:21.147 --> 00:22.106
- Look, Pete.
- What?

00:22.148 --> 00:23.483
Just a couple more days.

00:23.525 --> 00:25.360
And then what?
Y-y-you get this money?

00:25.401 --> 00:26.569
Yes, I promise.

00:26.986 --> 00:27.862
I promise.

00:28.321 --> 00:31.199
- I didn't steal your family.
- They think you're me!

00:31.241 --> 00:33.201
We do not have to
settle this right now.

00:33.243 --> 00:34.118
But it's not fair!

00:34.160 --> 00:36.037
I know. Alright, come on.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.289
- Not fair...
- I know. I know it's not fair.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.083
What is this, a picnic?

00:40.124 --> 00:41.751
I'd have punched you in the fucking throat.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.337
Hey, thanks for the support.

00:44.379 --> 00:46.297
Yeah, there's no way
I'm getting in the middle of that.

00:47.632 --> 00:49.259
Wasn't he supposed to be here by now?

00:51.052 --> 00:51.928
He'll be here.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.514
What do they even look like?

00:56.140 --> 00:57.559
The same, older.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.312
Your grandfather had a stroke.

01:02.647 --> 01:04.357
- He had a stroke?
- He's alright.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.733
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.319
And your grandma hasn't changed at all.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.782
What about Julia and Taylor?

01:13.032 --> 01:14.659
All grown up, same as you.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.996
I can't stand that they think that he's me.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.040
I wanna see 'em.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.834
- I have to see them.
- I know...

01:23.459 --> 01:25.420
but we have to do this first.

01:26.713 --> 01:28.590
We're so close, Pete. Trust me.

01:28.881 --> 01:29.966
We need him...

01:30.008 --> 01:33.052
to get the money and stay alive.
Please?

01:45.940 --> 01:46.816
Porter.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.193
Marius.

01:50.486 --> 01:51.362
Nice place.

01:52.614 --> 01:53.948
What do you think about the buffalo?

01:55.074 --> 01:56.451
What do you think I think?

01:59.621 --> 02:01.873
Mohegan has three casinos.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.833
This is Casino of the Wind.

02:04.584 --> 02:06.544
The red circles, cameras.

02:07.086 --> 02:11.257
The yellow circles are spotting stations
and the green arrows are exits.

02:11.424 --> 02:14.177
That's all the, uh,
security I could identify.

02:14.677 --> 02:15.970
You might have missed something.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.556
Ah.

02:18.598 --> 02:19.599
There's your buffalo.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.143
So what do you think about the vanish?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.102
Sure.

02:23.728 --> 02:25.396
- Oh.
- If it was still in the museum.

02:25.438 --> 02:26.689
But here, in the middle of a casino

02:26.731 --> 02:30.109
with sight lines to three security stations
and eyes in the ceiling?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.028
It can't be done.

02:32.570 --> 02:33.446
Jesus.

02:33.488 --> 02:34.697
This is your miracle worker?

02:37.450 --> 02:39.786
"The trick is always impossible
until it isn't." Those are your words.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.828
Maybe I was wrong.

02:40.912 --> 02:41.788
You don't believe that.

02:44.374 --> 02:45.458
Almost impossible

02:46.668 --> 02:47.794
and risky as hell.

02:48.503 --> 02:49.379
I'm listening.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.339
You need a slippery Sam.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.008
A big move to cover the small moves.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.051
- Right.
- Which means...

02:55.093 --> 02:56.344
We need a second buffalo.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.096
To start with.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.681
Well, if it was easy, anybody could do it.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.308
- That's my line.
- I know. I'm just siding with you.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.601
So we need a second buffalo.

03:03.643 --> 03:04.519
I heard that.

03:06.521 --> 03:08.439
OK, do you know where to find
a second buffalo?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.650
No. Do you?

03:11.984 --> 03:14.987
So, your job, you basically
solve mysteries for criminals?

03:15.154 --> 03:16.030
Part of my job.

03:16.072 --> 03:17.824
OK, well, this? This is my job

03:18.449 --> 03:21.577
and in order to do my job,
I need you to trust me.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.705
Ha. Trust you?

03:24.872 --> 03:28.376
Yeah, um, when you finish over there,
could we, um, get started?

03:28.418 --> 03:30.712
What is the...
what is the key problem here?

03:30.795 --> 03:33.715
365 degrees of visibility.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.050
We gotta cut the damn thing in half.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.095
Are you gonna say anything?

03:41.264 --> 03:42.140
About what?

03:42.849 --> 03:44.559
About what the fuck do you think?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.644
Gavin. What, did you forget?

03:46.686 --> 03:49.522
He was the one in the shower curtain
with the knife in his chest.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.691
So we still gotta do the small move...

03:51.733 --> 03:55.611
You got a friend ends up
in a shark tank, gets eaten.

03:55.653 --> 03:59.407
Now, you blame the shark, or the person
who pushed your friend into the tank?

03:59.449 --> 04:01.993
And we're still gonna get
the money from them, right?

04:02.368 --> 04:04.620
- We're definitely getting the money.
- Right.

What the fuck?

04:52.668 --> 04:55.922
- Where's Trish?
- Yeah, no, I actually owe Trish an apology.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.548
She thought I was here as a cop.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.259
But I'm not.
I'm here as a private citizen.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.845
Then private citizen Taylor Bowman
can get the fuck out.

05:02.887 --> 05:03.763
Lance.

05:04.639 --> 05:07.266
As much as it pains me to say it...

05:07.308 --> 05:08.559
I need your help with something.

05:09.811 --> 05:10.853
Come with me right now

05:11.646 --> 05:12.814
I'll never bother you again.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.027
Hey, get the fuck out, man!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.239
Trish! Trish!

05:21.280 --> 05:23.741
- Oh, shit.
- Get the fuck out. Trish!

05:37.880 --> 05:41.008
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to resume
that job I put you on the other day.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.886
I followed your friend for three days.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.054
- I didn't see anything.
<i>- Yeah, well</i>

05:45.096 --> 05:46.597
<i>I was out with my friend last night</i>

05:46.639 --> 05:48.349
and saw the other guy
with another woman.

05:48.850 --> 05:51.102
Knowing her,
she's gonna wanna see him ASAP.

05:51.143 --> 05:54.272
Well, then, your friend has terrible timing,
cos today's my day off.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.024
Maybe he'll fire you.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.194
- You can come back and work for us.
- Sean pays better.

06:01.696 --> 06:03.281
Is that all you care about, is money?

06:04.824 --> 06:06.534
It's not all I care about.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.077
Come on.

06:11.789 --> 06:12.790
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.208
We're looking for Colin.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.670
Um, he's not here.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.841
Well, it's really... it's pretty important
that we find him.

06:21.883 --> 06:22.925
Do you know where he is?

06:24.010 --> 06:25.887
I think he's downtown somewhere.

06:26.512 --> 06:27.555
Oh, wait, you know what?

06:27.597 --> 06:28.514
Maybe that was yesterday--

06:28.556 --> 06:30.224
- Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
- Oh...

06:30.308 --> 06:32.059
- Prostate's acting up.
- Um...

06:32.602 --> 06:36.772
Wow, OK. Yeah, um...
it's just down the hall and to your right.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.107
Uh...

06:39.692 --> 06:40.610
I like his hat.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.028
So does he.

06:56.918 --> 06:58.377
- No, we don't have a dog.
- No?

06:58.586 --> 06:59.712
We did have a dog...

07:00.504 --> 07:01.380
Uh, sorry.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.050
Did you mean your right or my right?

07:05.843 --> 07:06.844
Um...

07:10.264 --> 07:11.265
There it is.

07:11.307 --> 07:12.892
Uh...

07:20.066 --> 07:21.108
Well, what do you know?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.612
I think he said something about mail...

07:24.695 --> 07:25.780
You mean the post office?

07:25.947 --> 07:27.698
I don't know.

07:27.823 --> 07:28.699
Uh...

07:28.991 --> 07:29.867
Oh!

07:30.242 --> 07:31.494
Thanks a lot for your help.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.413
- Wait, what are you doing with that?
- Uh, Colin wanted us to have it.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.040
- It's an Irish thing.
- It's an Irish thing.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.127
- Where'd you find it?
- It was hanging over the shitter.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.088
Oh, kid's got no respect.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.798
Hey! Hey!

07:44.548 --> 07:46.467
Hey, so I remember where Colin is.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.552
Um, he said "bail"

07:48.594 --> 07:52.306
not "mail," so I guess
he's staking out some bail bonds office

07:52.348 --> 07:54.266
- on Elm Street--
- Bernhardt Bail Bonds?

07:54.308 --> 07:55.518
Yeah, that's the one.

08:05.778 --> 08:06.654
Three people?

08:08.406 --> 08:09.365
That's terrible.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.534
Were those the robbers?

08:13.411 --> 08:14.745
I s... I see.

08:16.831 --> 08:17.707
Really?

08:18.124 --> 08:20.084
What did he say?

08:22.837 --> 08:24.630
Uh, well, thank you so much for your help.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.008
I didn't think you were coming in today.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.301
Uh, yeah, I took a...

08:29.468 --> 08:33.180
I took a certified check as a deposit
on a bond and hid it in the back.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.474
You should really put that in the safe.

08:36.267 --> 08:39.645
Why I'm here,
not being trusted with the combination.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.031
Who were you talking to?

08:51.032 --> 08:54.744
Ginny, at the courthouse,
uh, double-checking Sperling's court date.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.540
Hey, so, um, day after.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.045
How are you feeling about, um,
Maggie's return?

09:04.336 --> 09:07.339
Oh, um, you know, uh, I think she's right.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.175
Forgiving and forgetting are the key.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.014
No worry. I'll sit at the desk

09:15.306 --> 09:16.348
back turned, eyes closed.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.266
Mm.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.501
You done?

09:44.293 --> 09:45.169
I am.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.962
Could I give you some advice?

09:47.755 --> 09:48.839
Could I stop you?

09:49.715 --> 09:52.259
If you'd come in
and said you needed the gun

09:52.301 --> 09:56.806
just because you had, I don't know,
a bad feeling

09:58.140 --> 09:59.308
I wouldn't have thought twice

09:59.850 --> 10:01.435
but going through this rigmarole

10:01.602 --> 10:04.688
makes me think there's something
I should know. Is there?

10:07.066 --> 10:08.609
I just needed bullets.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.945
And?

10:13.155 --> 10:15.032
- Hello, there.
- Can we help you?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.618
Yes, you can.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.831
And you've assessed correctly.
I'm not here to bail anyone out.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.749
- Then what do you want?
- She knows what I want.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.000
I have no idea.

10:25.042 --> 10:25.960
Sure you do.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.838
You also know that bail bonds companies
still get a bond back

10:28.879 --> 10:30.131
if a defendant turns up dead.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.340
Luis tell you that?

10:32.341 --> 10:35.010
Alright, you got five seconds to leave
before I call the police.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.930
No, you won't, because right now
I don't plan to hurt either of you.

10:37.972 --> 10:39.640
I doubt you want me to change my mind.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.601
- Just give me a location.
- Julia.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.478
Don't say a goddamn word.

10:46.397 --> 10:47.356
He's unarmed.

10:47.398 --> 10:50.776
I know this because
I've got his gun right here.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.236
Come on, Grandpa.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.573
- I buy 'em by the dozen.
- No, no. I'm Grandpa.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.784
And I'd be willing to bet
this one'll be untraceable

10:58.826 --> 10:59.827
after we shoot you with it.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.330
Yeah, well, you didn't walk through the
logic on that one, did you, old timer?

11:03.706 --> 11:07.084
You'd still need to explain why you shot
an unarmed man at point-blank range.

11:07.126 --> 11:08.419
Then we'll shoot you with this gun

11:09.211 --> 11:10.504
and stick yours in your hand.

11:14.008 --> 11:15.176
Well, I guess I'll go...

11:16.302 --> 11:17.928
but if I leave here without a location

11:18.888 --> 11:22.725
you're choosing to do this the hard way,
because I will find what I'm looking for.

11:22.766 --> 11:23.726
Get out.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.196
Julia, what the hell
have you gotten yourself into?

11:41.327 --> 11:42.494
Where are we going?

11:43.287 --> 11:45.247
You're gonna take me
to where you and Dockery

11:45.289 --> 11:48.042
and his goon buried the body of the guy
who got stabbed in the head.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.964
- Why?
- Doesn't matter why.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.343
A thing about being a lawyer
is knowing when you need a lawyer.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.347
I am giving you your one chance
to not need a lawyer.

12:02.431 --> 12:05.768
You're gonna show me where that grave is,
or everything that you did

12:05.809 --> 12:06.810
conning Audrey

12:07.102 --> 12:09.230
disposing of the body,
it's all gonna come to light

12:09.688 --> 12:12.566
and you're gonna be disbarred and jailed

12:13.400 --> 12:15.653
before the next fucking
<i>Star Wars</i> movie comes out.

12:18.364 --> 12:20.366
I did it to get us
out of the Dockery situation.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.159
I didn't know Pete
was gonna bring the money back.

12:22.243 --> 12:25.246
What d'you wanna guess this Valerie's name
was on that prick's piece of paper?

12:25.287 --> 12:28.791
- Where do you have her stashed?
- A storage facility in Mount Vernon.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.376
Mount Vernon?

12:31.335 --> 12:33.170
Why would you use
a place in Mount Vernon?

12:33.879 --> 12:35.130
Aunt Maggie suggested it.

12:35.381 --> 12:41.095
Oh, must be that same place
that Lila and Danny used back in the day.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.096
They kept that guy in there.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.305
- What was that guy's name?
- Rinsler.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.057
- Yeah, Dean Rinsler.
- Stashed him there for a week.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.185
Yeah. I bet that's why Maggie
and her crew picked the place.

12:48.394 --> 12:49.937
She remembered it from before.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.313
Thought it'd be an easy target.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.398
What're you talking about?

12:52.648 --> 12:55.734
I told you I wanted to find out why
Pete and Maggie came back.

12:56.151 --> 12:59.530
I talked to a guy at the gun range
he robbed three years ago.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.864
Oh, Jesus, Audrey.

13:00.906 --> 13:05.577
He said it was connected to the robbery
of a storage facility in Mount Vernon.

13:05.995 --> 13:08.706
Several people were killed,
but one got away

13:08.998 --> 13:10.332
a white woman in her 50s.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.042
You think that was Aunt Maggie?

13:12.084 --> 13:14.128
- Who else could it be?
- It could've been anyone.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.838
Oh, Otto, stop!

13:16.130 --> 13:18.674
You know who
and what our daughter is.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.511
What do I do now?

13:23.804 --> 13:26.140
I got a pregnant lady in a storage facility

13:26.181 --> 13:29.768
who needs food delivered
and her bucket emptied

13:29.810 --> 13:32.938
except there's a man outside
who's gonna follow me everywhere I go.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.984
Well, he can't follow all of us.

13:43.032 --> 13:45.117
I'm sorry. It's not for sale.

13:46.952 --> 13:50.622
I understand, but could you
just hear us out for one second?

13:50.664 --> 13:51.540
Um...

13:53.000 --> 13:56.045
We're personal shoppers
for a very high net-worth individual.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.798
If anybody says it's Kevin Costner,
you didn't hear it from us.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.468
We found photographs of the buffalo online

14:02.509 --> 14:03.886
we sent it to our client.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.513
He believes this is one
of the Roosevelt buffaloes

14:06.555 --> 14:08.766
as in shot by Theodore Roosevelt.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.769
Now, you and I both know
that's highly unlikely

14:12.144 --> 14:14.188
but once our client
gets something in his head

14:14.229 --> 14:16.482
he's hard to convince otherwise,
so all I'm saying

14:16.774 --> 14:20.235
is that if you were to sell us the buffalo
for the going rate

14:21.070 --> 14:23.447
we could turn it around
and sell it to you-know-who

14:24.031 --> 14:25.282
for ten times that amount

14:26.075 --> 14:27.826
and we would split the difference.
What do you think?

14:27.993 --> 14:29.036
- What, no?
- Hmm...

14:29.078 --> 14:30.954
- No.
- I don't know.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.707
Margaret, tell Remi how much money
he stands to make.

14:33.791 --> 14:37.336
I'm sorry, everything that my colleague
just told you, it's a lie.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.005
- I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me?

14:40.047 --> 14:41.298
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait.

14:41.673 --> 14:42.925
Wait, I'm sorry.

14:43.384 --> 14:44.802
- You OK?
- Wait.

14:45.177 --> 14:46.595
I think I'm getting a migraine.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.472
My aura is, uh...

14:49.056 --> 14:50.849
I need to get my Imitrex. It's in the car.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.060
- Your what?
- My, my migraine medicine!

14:53.102 --> 14:54.186
I need to get it, in the car.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.688
Wait, Marius, wait...

14:56.939 --> 14:58.232
uh, we'll be right back.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.945
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I told you to follow my lead!

15:03.237 --> 15:05.989
- I, I just couldn't.
- You couldn't what? You couldn't lie?

15:06.365 --> 15:10.369
A man got acid thrown in his face.
I think, under the circumstances

15:10.411 --> 15:11.537
it is OK to lie.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.998
You know my problem isn't the lying.
My problem is, it was the wrong lie.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.170
- That man doesn't care about the money.
- Everybody cares about the money!

15:21.046 --> 15:22.339
Tha... he doesn't.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.632
He's not gonna sell the buffalo.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.384
Oh, is that what your spirit guide
is telling you?

15:25.426 --> 15:28.303
What, did you read the aura
of the buffalo or some bullshit?

15:28.345 --> 15:30.305
- Don't mock my beliefs.
- No, no, I'm not mocking you.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.559
I made $15,000 in two weeks
in New Orleans reading sitters.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.270
- No, I think it's a great racket.
- If we're all such frauds

15:36.395 --> 15:39.022
then how come Ethel
knew about your brother's toe?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.774
Oh, yeah, no, I'm still working on that.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.901
Yeah, well, you're still working on it
because it wasn't a trick.

15:44.486 --> 15:45.404
It's not a trick?

15:47.489 --> 15:48.699
Mm, I'm seeing a man.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.826
- Oh, stop it.
- No, no, he, he's...

15:50.868 --> 15:52.619
He's, he's...

15:52.661 --> 15:53.829
He's wearing a uniform.

15:54.163 --> 15:57.291
- Does that mean anything to you?
- He told you that his dad was military.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.042
No, no, this is before Pete's father.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.879
No, this guy promised
to get you out of Bridgeport

16:01.920 --> 16:03.881
because he said you were too special
to be stuck there

16:04.256 --> 16:05.215
and you believed him

16:05.257 --> 16:07.509
just like you believed all the others
who told you the same thing.

16:08.677 --> 16:09.636
There were only two.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.638
Yeah, but by the time
the second guy came around

16:11.680 --> 16:14.808
you were so desperate to get out of there,
you betrayed your whole family.

16:15.726 --> 16:16.810
You told a lie.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.854
Oh, my God, screw you.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.147
No, that's just what my spirit guide's
telling me.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.899
No, people come to me
because they're in pain.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.943
They're looking for comfort,
so I use my gifts to help them.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.695
Every time, just you and your spirit guide?

16:26.737 --> 16:29.281
Yeah, fine, I don't have Ethel's
extraordinary gift.

16:29.740 --> 16:33.494
Sometimes, the spirit...
it reaches out, sometimes not

16:33.785 --> 16:37.331
so, yes, in order not to leave
the client hanging

16:37.789 --> 16:42.377
sometimes I use shortcuts to help.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.340
Shortcuts?

16:47.841 --> 16:51.386
You mean like you pay attention
to what they wear and how they talk

16:51.428 --> 16:53.514
and how they move and what they look at?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.725
Maybe you take a peek in their purse
when they get up to go to the bathroom?

16:58.769 --> 17:00.646
How is that any different from what I do?

17:02.648 --> 17:06.276
I use these techniques to help people,
not hurt them.

17:06.318 --> 17:10.030
I do it because I don't have Ethel's gift,
or yours.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.244
I love the things that you tell yourself.

17:18.872 --> 17:19.748
What is my gift?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.417
To just not care.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.923
Which you got from your mother.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.468
The heroin addict.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.765
What, are you reading me now?

17:38.517 --> 17:39.434
Pete tell you that?

17:39.685 --> 17:41.812
Pete didn't need to tell me.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.690
I see it when you walk into a room

17:45.190 --> 17:46.567
the way you take the temperature

17:47.359 --> 17:50.195
adjust yourself
like an emotional contortionist.

17:51.780 --> 17:52.906
Must be exhausting.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.704
I think I really am getting a migraine.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.168
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't have burned you.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.837
I just, I didn't know what to do.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.298
You were barking up the wrong tree.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.013
Greed is rarely the wrong answer.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.975
You know, the thing is, though, this guy...
He's got the buffalo

18:20.017 --> 18:23.228
and several other pieces set aside,
and they're so lovingly displayed

18:23.270 --> 18:25.439
it's clear to me
he doesn't want money for them.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.566
He wants people to appreciate them.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.072
Yeah, no, you're right.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.409
You're right.
I, I should've seen that.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.787
Well, I, I should've
handled it differently.

18:42.748 --> 18:45.000
No, this is good.
I think, well, let's work the problem.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.338
Uh, yeah, but how? I...

18:49.504 --> 18:50.756
I mean, he won't sell.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.677
That's OK.
Maybe we're not buying.

19:20.702 --> 19:21.578
You sure?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.789
I paid attention, in case I had to run.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.460
Wanted to know
how to get back to the highway.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.130
They could've driven in circles
to throw you off.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.423
I wasn't blindfolded.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.843
Like they didn't care what you saw.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.389
Jesus.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.600
That must have scared the shit out of you.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.395
You think?

19:50.857 --> 19:51.733
OK.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.402
Oh...

19:54.528 --> 19:56.071
Oh, hi, Remi.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.573
Sorry, OK, honey,
why don't you sit right there?

19:58.824 --> 20:01.910
Sit right there, this, by the doors,
fresh air?

20:02.661 --> 20:04.705
- Good for your head.
- Is he going to be OK?

20:04.746 --> 20:06.081
Oh, yeah, he's gonna be fine.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.333
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Remi

20:08.375 --> 20:09.876
about what happened earlier.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.253
Oh, you said he was lying.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.839
No, I know, I know. I know. He was.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.049
But he doesn't know that.
He doesn't know it. So...

20:17.759 --> 20:19.302
Who is this remarkable woman?

20:20.804 --> 20:22.139
That was my grandmother.

20:23.181 --> 20:26.518
She's beautiful.
Her spirit just leaps off the canvas.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.728
It does, doesn't it?

20:28.395 --> 20:32.399
She ran a Texas dude ranch
by herself well into her 80s.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.734
Wow, that's amazing.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.485
- Wow.
- She was my hero.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.407
- She died a few years ago.
- Did she?

20:40.824 --> 20:43.118
All of the not-for-sale items
in here were hers.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.120
- Oh, all of these?
- Including the bison.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.164
Oh, really? The bison, too?

20:49.207 --> 20:51.960
My, my goodness, are you alright?

20:52.377 --> 20:53.462
Yes, well...

20:56.006 --> 20:56.882
Remi...

20:58.759 --> 21:02.637
My son, he, he doesn't have a migraine.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.347
He has a brain tumour.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.933
Oh, I...

21:06.975 --> 21:08.435
Oh, thank you.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.897
Nobody has handkerchiefs anymore, Remi.

21:13.398 --> 21:17.819
It's just, he... the radiation shrunk it,
but then the chemo didn't work

21:17.861 --> 21:20.197
and so now, we're just...
I'm taking him around

21:20.238 --> 21:22.616
and just showing him
what he wants to see until--

21:22.657 --> 21:23.742
I am so sorry.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.871
But may I ask why an antiques store?

21:27.913 --> 21:28.789
I don't know.

21:29.164 --> 21:31.958
Wouldn't he rather see
the Empire State Building

21:32.000 --> 21:32.876
- or something?
- I don't know.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.753
You know, who can explain
these things?

21:34.795 --> 21:38.423
It's just, he... his favourite movie
is <i>Dances with Wolves</i>

21:38.465 --> 21:42.177
and his favourite scene in the movie
is the buffalo stampede.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.179
And it's the brain tumour.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.973
It's, it's, it's screwing with his head

21:47.015 --> 21:49.893
and it's why he thinks
he's working for Kevin Costner.

21:50.727 --> 21:51.728
My word.

21:52.854 --> 21:53.730
Hey, there.

21:55.774 --> 21:59.361
Your mum tells me
that you'd like a bison in your home

21:59.402 --> 22:00.779
- for your...
- For your party.

22:00.821 --> 22:02.864
Your big party.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.324
Yeah, yeah, you should come.

22:05.033 --> 22:05.992
Kevin's gonna be there.

22:06.034 --> 22:06.993
- Yes, honey.
- Right?

22:07.035 --> 22:08.912
Kevin will be there. I promise.

22:14.793 --> 22:15.669
Yeah.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.475
About fucking time.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.396
I need to hear you
go to the back of the unit.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.441
- Who are you?
- I'm with Bernhardt Bail Bonds.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.111
How do I know you're not with Luis?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.572
I suppose you don't, but I control the lock

22:43.613 --> 22:45.198
and I'm here to supply you
with food and water.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.783
Step to the back of the unit.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.620
OK, I'm at the back.

22:53.790 --> 22:54.875
This is illegal.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.710
You'd think so, but it's not.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.046
What about the bucket?

23:00.964 --> 23:02.924
Does it need emptying?

23:03.258 --> 23:06.344
Well, let's just say
it's not only a piss bucket anymore.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.973
Oh. Put it by the door, then go back.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.600
Fine, I'm done.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.772
Wave your arms so the light goes.

23:18.648 --> 23:19.524
Fuck you.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.943
Get me the fuck out of here!

23:23.695 --> 23:24.613
Hey!

23:25.864 --> 23:27.490
- This my storage facility.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.993
This not jail cell.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.122
I'm fucking with you.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.123
Wow.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.544
You, you must be mother of Maggie.

23:41.004 --> 23:41.922
I am.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.798
Hm. You have name?

23:44.507 --> 23:47.093
- Is that necessary?
- It's polite.

23:48.929 --> 23:49.930
Audrey.

23:50.263 --> 23:51.848
Audrey.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.352
You, ah... you want help with bucket?

23:56.227 --> 23:58.813
Bako will make sure guest stays.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.107
I think she should learn her lesson.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.400
Ah, smart.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.528
Rub her nose in it,
like teaching bad puppy.

24:06.029 --> 24:06.905
Yeah.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.658
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

24:10.784 --> 24:11.910
I am Luka.

24:15.705 --> 24:16.581
Luka Delchev.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.417
Audrey.

24:20.377 --> 24:21.294
Maggie's mum.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.547
Let's go, Bako.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.307
OK, I think we need to try this again.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.480
I can feel you fighting the urge to
shoot me in the back of the head.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.315
Left my gun in the car.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.278
No. No, I'm wondering
what the hell Julia ever saw in you.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.365
Well, she grew up
with a meathead jock for a brother.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.118
I can't blame her for going in the complete
opposite direction.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.869
Look how that turned out for her.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.375
That's the wrong question, isn't it?

25:01.084 --> 25:05.255
She's a single mother, struggling to get by,
you're a reasonably successful lawyer.

25:06.297 --> 25:09.217
Real question's... what did you see in her?

25:10.844 --> 25:13.138
- What a wonderful brother.
- I'm serious.

25:14.597 --> 25:17.350
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.062
And she's a single mother,
struggling to get by.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.232
- What about Trish?
- What about her?

25:26.693 --> 25:29.362
She come from a fucked-up family?
Hm?

25:29.988 --> 25:32.782
Maybe suffer from anxiety and depression?

25:34.576 --> 25:37.412
I mean, it all fits with your con
that you tried to pull on Audrey, right?

25:37.454 --> 25:41.875
I mean, how you angled it all so that
you could swoop in and save everybody.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.043
Lance.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.129
You wanna be a hero.

25:46.671 --> 25:47.547
Well, who doesn't?

25:49.257 --> 25:50.884
Did you become a cop for the pension plan?

25:56.264 --> 25:59.517
You got no idea where this fucking grave is,
do you?

26:01.853 --> 26:04.272
It was dark, and all these trees
looked the fucking same.

26:07.067 --> 26:07.942
Fuck.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.448
Damn.

26:13.782 --> 26:16.159
Now that is a goddamn buffalo.

26:16.785 --> 26:17.660
Bison.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.996
Buffaloes are only found
in Asia and Africa.

26:20.789 --> 26:21.915
This is the American bison.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.041
Mm.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.668
What's important is that we got one.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.171
- Where's Joseph?
- Joseph's stuck in California.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.130
That's Robert.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.341
Never Bob. Robert.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.885
Hey, thanks for trusting Marius.

26:33.927 --> 26:35.136
Uh, I didn't trust him.

26:35.178 --> 26:36.721
I tracked his fucking phone.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.849
How'd you get your hands
on this girl so fast?

26:39.891 --> 26:42.894
Maggie went online
and found it in an antique store.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.729
Yeah, unfortunately, it wasn't for sale.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.856
And then I fucked everything up
and she saved the day.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.483
Yeah, it was your migraine act that saved it.

26:51.528 --> 26:55.490
When you're done congratulating yourselves,
how much do we need for the show and tell?

26:55.532 --> 26:59.494
We just need proof of concept,
so it's the set-up, it's the misdirect

26:59.536 --> 27:01.287
and the...

27:01.329 --> 27:02.205
Whoa.

27:02.872 --> 27:03.957
Eh, we got a problem?

27:04.749 --> 27:05.750
Uh, yeah.

27:06.251 --> 27:07.627
We're on a schedule. Fix it.

27:08.044 --> 27:11.214
- This isn't gonna work, you need to tell me.
- It's gonna work.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.802
- You like him better than me.
- Oh, my God, no.

27:16.553 --> 27:18.972
You're my own little man.
You're my Pete.

27:23.768 --> 27:24.811
So you take my name

27:25.937 --> 27:27.272
and then you take my family

27:27.313 --> 27:30.024
and now you, what?
You want my mum, too? Huh?

27:30.942 --> 27:33.236
- You really don't know me, do you?
- No, I do.

27:33.278 --> 27:35.113
I, I know you.
I know you well enough--

27:35.155 --> 27:36.447
I don't want your family.

27:39.826 --> 27:40.785
I want the money.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.329
Pete, listen to his words.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.373
What? No! He... what? He's a liar.

27:46.374 --> 27:47.959
What can I do to make you believe me?

27:48.459 --> 27:50.253
Look, all we're doing is setting up a job.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.339
Once it's done, once it's over, I'm gone.

27:53.381 --> 27:57.552
Pete, we need to find a way
to make this work for all of us, honey.

27:58.303 --> 27:59.179
Do you understand?

27:59.220 --> 28:02.390
What can we do? We'll do anything.
Anything you ask.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.350
- Yeah.
- What can we do?

28:07.770 --> 28:08.646
Anything?

28:12.358 --> 28:14.194
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.737
- Hi, Mum.
- Hi, Grandma.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.282
Uh, Audrey Bernhardt. And you are?

28:23.745 --> 28:25.246
Marius Josipovic.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.255
Uh, Carly! They're here.

28:36.424 --> 28:37.300
Oh, ho!

28:38.593 --> 28:40.845
Uh, Otto, this is Pete's friend Marius.

28:41.137 --> 28:45.308
Oh, my God, it's, it's, it's nice to...

28:47.143 --> 28:48.144
It's nice to meet you.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.314
You know, you look a little familiar to me.

28:51.356 --> 28:53.274
- Have we met before?
- That's highly unlikely.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.609
Where's, uh, where's Taylor?

28:54.651 --> 28:55.902
Uh, he'll be here soon.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.363
I'm sorry, honey.
What did you say your name was?

28:58.613 --> 28:59.489
Gina.

28:59.739 --> 29:00.990
I'm Marius' girlfriend.

29:01.908 --> 29:02.784
Nice to meet you.

29:02.867 --> 29:03.868
If you'll excuse me...

29:04.786 --> 29:06.454
- I have to help Julia in the kitchen.
- OK, Dad.

29:07.705 --> 29:08.581
Hi.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.291
Oh, hi, hon!

29:11.084 --> 29:13.253
Marius, it's really a pleasure to--
Oh!

29:13.711 --> 29:15.546
Yeah, he's a, he's a hugger.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.715
It was a problem on the cell block.

29:18.091 --> 29:21.469
Yeah. Yeah, I imagine it would've been.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.305
Why don't I talk to Maggie?

29:24.347 --> 29:26.391
See what I can find out
about this storage place?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.684
Pete might not even know what's going on.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.185
Like hell.

29:29.811 --> 29:33.189
I bet their two friends are in on it, too,
whatever it is.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.692
Seriously?
Right now, you see, I calmed down.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.151
Take a deep breath...

29:38.319 --> 29:39.195
or that.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.869
- Hey.
- They here?

29:47.578 --> 29:48.579
Yeah, they're with Grandpa.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.749
- You met Josipovic yet?
- Not yet.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.252
What if he recognises me from the motel?

29:54.919 --> 29:56.087
He's the criminal here.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.756
- So you do think he killed Winslow?
- That is not what I meant.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.341
Come on.

30:03.011 --> 30:08.182
When, when, uh, when Marius
and I were in the joint together

30:08.558 --> 30:11.311
I would tell him stories
about you guys and this place...

30:11.352 --> 30:14.022
- Yeah.
- And it always lifted our spirits.

30:15.356 --> 30:16.357
Yeah, it's true.

30:16.566 --> 30:19.569
I mean, I almost feel
like you're my family.

30:19.986 --> 30:20.862
Ha!

30:21.946 --> 30:25.241
Well, any friend of my grandson's
is a friend of mine.

30:26.576 --> 30:27.785
And now that you two are back

30:28.453 --> 30:30.955
I'd be happy to have a family dinner
every night.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.707
- To family.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.625
- Oh!
- To family.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.295
- To family.
- To family.

30:38.171 --> 30:39.047
Skol.

30:40.715 --> 30:43.968
It's really nice of Pete
to take care of his cellmate like this.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.762
Yeah, yeah, very sweet.

30:47.722 --> 30:48.598
Ahem. Hey, Pete.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.727
I thought you said that your friend here
went to Ottawa.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.940
He's back now.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.652
What, are you gonna
interrogate me now?

31:01.694 --> 31:03.654
You can take the cop out of the station.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.990
Holy shit, Taylor, you're a cop now?

31:07.408 --> 31:08.576
- Huh!
- "Now"?

31:08.951 --> 31:12.538
He means now, because in the stories
I would tell him we were kids

31:12.580 --> 31:15.416
and I didn't want to tell him you're a cop,
cos I didn't want to make him nervous.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.044
- Right.
- But yes, Marius, Taylor's a cop.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.046
He's not gonna arrest anybody, but yeah.

31:20.088 --> 31:21.839
Not tonight, at least

31:22.757 --> 31:26.052
but there is a New York homicide detective

31:26.094 --> 31:29.222
that would really like to talk
to Mr Josipovic.

31:29.722 --> 31:33.393
Hey, didn't your probation officer
call you Josipovic the other day?

31:34.435 --> 31:35.311
A lot of questions.

31:35.353 --> 31:37.730
You met Pete's probation officer?

31:37.772 --> 31:39.732
Uh, briefly, yeah. It's a long story.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.692
Yeah, no, that is actually a funny story.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.486
Um, we had a, a guard

31:43.861 --> 31:47.573
when we were in together
who would call us by our cellie's names

31:47.615 --> 31:51.035
and it was one of these things
that would make us feel unimportant

31:51.077 --> 31:52.453
- or, you know...
- That's terrible.

31:52.495 --> 31:55.289
Yeah, it's like the dehumanising
prison thing.

31:55.331 --> 31:59.210
Wait, why would your parole officer

32:00.002 --> 32:01.838
know what some guard called you in prison?

32:02.630 --> 32:04.966
- Well, that's what's funny, because--
- It's weird.

32:05.133 --> 32:06.259
No, listen to this.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.471
My parole officer is our guard's brother.

32:10.513 --> 32:12.598
No shit.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.142
No, these guys are really intense.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.018
He make you squat and cough, too?

32:16.060 --> 32:17.395
Oh, God, Dad!

32:17.854 --> 32:19.605
- I'm sorry.
- Grandpa!

32:19.647 --> 32:24.402
Pete, I thought you used Josipovic
as an alias for your insurance work.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.946
Yeah, I used a lot of different aliases.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.866
It's just what came to my mind, you know?
It's probably from the guard.

32:31.075 --> 32:34.162
Well, it seems dangerous,
exposing your friend like that.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.913
I agree, I agree.

32:35.955 --> 32:39.000
I do. Especially considering
he didn't tell me

32:39.667 --> 32:41.210
that he was gonna use my name.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.088
- But I did tell you, remember?
- No.

32:44.130 --> 32:48.885
Yeah, I did, right before I gave you
a cut of the money that I made doing it.

32:48.926 --> 32:50.720
No, but that was after you already did it

32:50.761 --> 32:53.014
- so I didn't really have much of a choice.
- Well, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

32:53.055 --> 32:55.266
- Good.
- I'm Pete Murphy from here on out.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.853
It's OK, it's OK.

32:59.228 --> 33:02.940
Gina, how did you...
how did you and Marius meet?

33:03.149 --> 33:04.984
- Was it before or after?
- Yeah.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.945
You know, actually, it was during.

33:08.488 --> 33:10.740
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a literacy teacher

33:10.781 --> 33:13.951
at the prison and Marius
was one of my students.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.370
It sounds creepy, but it's...

33:16.996 --> 33:19.790
he understood Shakespeare
better than any student I've ever taught.

33:19.832 --> 33:20.708
Wow.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.377
Yeah, yeah.
Just listening to him read the sonnets

33:24.128 --> 33:26.297
- I fell in love.
- Huh, wow.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.134
Yeah, I guess some women
just have a thing for criminals.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.137
I think it's romantic.

33:33.179 --> 33:36.265
Yeah, it reminds me of, uh, Lila and Danny.

33:36.682 --> 33:41.020
No, no, no, Mum and Dad met
when she gave him a concussion.

33:41.354 --> 33:43.564
- So...
- So, yeah, that's right.

33:43.606 --> 33:45.775
It's a little bit dangerous and romantic.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.151
It's like Romeo and Juliet.

33:47.401 --> 33:50.613
No, no, no, no, it's more like
<i>Tenspeed and Brown Shoe.</i>

33:51.614 --> 33:53.282
Hey, Aunt Maggie?

33:53.407 --> 33:55.993
I was wondering if maybe
after this we could try another reading

33:56.035 --> 33:58.746
- maybe try to talk to Mum?
- Yeah, for sure, of course.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.707
Oh. Hey, wait a second.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.836
You came to...
you came to the motel room.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.713
- The, the, yeah...
- What?

34:08.005 --> 34:10.466
That's the one... remember I told you,
someone brought pizza.

34:10.508 --> 34:12.802
That's because,
when you came here that night

34:12.843 --> 34:15.137
and you were thinking about using again

34:15.429 --> 34:19.475
Carly, uh, saw us and she followed us
back to the motel.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.435
- Isn't that right, Carly?
- Yeah.

34:21.477 --> 34:22.520
What do you mean, "using"?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.855
Pete. Pete... He didn't tell you?

34:25.565 --> 34:27.358
- Uh...
- I'm a drug addict.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.110
- He's an ex-drug addict.
- Active drug addict.

34:29.151 --> 34:31.237
- He's in recovery right now.
- My name's Marius Josipovic

34:31.279 --> 34:32.238
and I'm a con man.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.323
I'm the lowest of the low.

34:34.365 --> 34:36.409
I think that murderers are better than me

34:36.450 --> 34:39.245
because what I do is I go in
and I lie to people.

34:39.287 --> 34:41.831
- I steal their families.
- Let's not make this a meeting right now.

34:41.872 --> 34:42.999
Let's not make this a meeting.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.959
We all make mistakes. We do.

34:45.001 --> 34:48.254
But, you know, the important thing
is we learn from them and we move on.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.756
- Right?
- For some of us, uh

34:50.798 --> 34:52.508
mistakes are a pattern we choose to repeat.

34:52.883 --> 34:55.094
Well... What does that mean?

34:56.053 --> 34:58.431
It means I know about the storage facility!

35:06.439 --> 35:07.690
What storage facility?

35:08.190 --> 35:10.276
- Carly, go upstairs.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

35:10.318 --> 35:12.403
- Go upstairs!
- Don't talk to her that way.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.488
Don't yell at her. She's not a child.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.574
And you're not her mother!

35:16.616 --> 35:19.410
Bad enough you fill her head
with nonsense about talking to Lila.

35:19.452 --> 35:23.289
Just because you don't understand something
doesn't make it nonsense.

35:25.333 --> 35:29.337
Pete held up a gun range while you robbed
Hall Street Storage in Mount Vernon.

35:29.670 --> 35:30.671
Tell me I'm wrong.

35:30.713 --> 35:33.924
- Wait, what?
- What I don't understand or can't figure out

35:34.425 --> 35:37.553
is why you sent Julia there of all places,
two days ago.

35:37.595 --> 35:40.556
Maggie, is Julia in danger?

35:40.598 --> 35:41.766
What? No.

35:41.807 --> 35:45.394
Julia had a problem
and I actually went to help her fix it.

35:45.436 --> 35:46.687
- It's OK.
- I was--

35:46.729 --> 35:47.855
They already know about Valerie.

35:49.023 --> 35:49.899
OK.

35:50.858 --> 35:53.277
- I mean, I just was trying to help Julia.
- Oh, bullshit!

35:54.195 --> 35:56.864
You two show up out of the blue
after all this time.

35:57.573 --> 35:58.616
You're up to something.

35:58.658 --> 35:59.950
I'm not up to anything.

35:59.992 --> 36:04.455
Grandma, Grandma.
We're here because Grandpa had a stroke.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.165
That was six months ago!

36:06.540 --> 36:09.168
Stop treating us like we're senile.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.419
Tell me why you're really here.

36:10.461 --> 36:12.922
- There's nothing to tell.
- Tell me, now!

36:12.963 --> 36:16.425
Mum, look, there is nothing to tell.

36:16.467 --> 36:17.802
Then get out of this house!

36:18.260 --> 36:19.637
Dad?

36:19.679 --> 36:23.641
Maggie, I love you, but if you can't tell
us what's going on, you've gotta leave.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.103
- Grandpa...
- Alright, I'm out. Let's go.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.271
Yeah. Come on, Marius.

36:29.313 --> 36:30.189
Come on.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.525
- Alright.
- Gotta go.

36:32.566 --> 36:33.526
What?

36:35.319 --> 36:36.320
Sorry.

36:38.906 --> 36:40.241
No, wait. Aunt Maggie, wait.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.076
Honey, it's OK.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.286
We'll, we'll contact your mum
some other time.

36:45.037 --> 36:45.955
I promise.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.460
You are such a bitch!

37:05.975 --> 37:09.228
I just couldn't sit there any longer,
let them lie to my face.

37:11.856 --> 37:12.732
Doesn't matter.

37:14.817 --> 37:16.068
I'll find out what they're up to.

37:16.110 --> 37:18.487
Mm. We may have to put a pin in that,
Grandma.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.866
We have some more pressing issues
to deal with.

37:21.907 --> 37:22.908
Oh, God.

37:24.410 --> 37:27.037
- You didn't find the gun?
- No, I told you, I found the gun.

37:28.164 --> 37:29.123
I couldn't find the grave.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.292
Gun?

37:33.794 --> 37:34.670
Grave?

37:37.256 --> 37:38.507
I'll make coffee.

37:56.692 --> 37:57.777
It was good to see 'em.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.363
All of 'em.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.786
God, I never would've recognised Julia.

38:09.121 --> 38:10.664
Really good to see your mum.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.351
So that's it, then. I'm going to jail.

38:34.647 --> 38:35.523
No, you're not.

38:38.567 --> 38:39.443
That kid...

38:40.361 --> 38:42.321
That kid who's been following Julia...

38:43.823 --> 38:45.366
he's the dead guy's son.

38:46.283 --> 38:47.868
He's been living in his dad's house.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.665
Gun turns up there,
that's just as good as his grave.

38:52.748 --> 38:53.999
And you don't have to worry
about Colin being there.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.334
He's too busy trying to kill Valerie.

38:58.254 --> 38:59.797
Sam and I will go see Luis.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.591
We'll try to get him
to lift the hit on Valerie.

39:04.635 --> 39:07.763
I'll go to Dockery, suggest that
his money's being messed with.

39:07.805 --> 39:11.058
I mean, I got to think that even Luis
Mercado is scared of Chayton Dockery.

39:13.227 --> 39:15.479
I'll try and find out
what Pete and Maggie are up to.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.290
Good...

39:44.842 --> 39:45.843
Ta da!

39:46.218 --> 39:47.094
Where'd it go?

39:48.804 --> 39:50.431
It's magic, is where it went.

39:50.472 --> 39:51.932
OK, uh, let's do that again.

39:51.974 --> 39:54.935
This time, hit that deflate button
a half second sooner

39:54.977 --> 39:58.188
because I saw the shape
when you pulled the sheet.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.983
Nothing about the great trick
I put together in no time at all?

40:01.025 --> 40:02.568
Well, it was the best trick
I've ever seen in my life.

40:02.610 --> 40:03.527
Oh, it was the best trick
you've ever seen in your life?

40:03.569 --> 40:04.820
- Let's do it again.
- He's right.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.488
It's a good trick.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.324
But what I don't understand...

40:08.991 --> 40:11.702
is how they fuck Luka over
and keep the money for themselves.

40:12.036 --> 40:14.121
I'm more interested in
how they get the buffalo out.

40:15.205 --> 40:18.000
Excuse me, Marius,
but who are these people?

40:18.042 --> 40:19.418
- Let me--
- Oh, he didn't tell you?

40:20.377 --> 40:23.547
Well, Mr Leon Porter, sir, we're the FBI.

40:32.890 --> 40:33.766
Go away.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.893
You gonna kick me out of the house, too?

40:36.060 --> 40:37.770
I'd like you to take a ride with me.

40:38.646 --> 40:39.772
I need your help with something.

40:41.982 --> 40:42.858
No, thank you.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.195
It's not a request.

40:48.906 --> 40:50.032
There's one for each of you.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.618
Everything you've ever been
even suspected of doing

40:52.660 --> 40:54.244
since you were 18 years old.

40:54.954 --> 40:57.539
Every con, every hack

40:58.374 --> 41:01.418
every safe cracked,
every five-finger discount

41:01.835 --> 41:05.756
every drug pushed on the reserve,
every house robbed.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.008
And we don't need a file for you

41:08.592 --> 41:10.010
because Marius switched your records

41:10.052 --> 41:12.262
so... you go to prison, no matter what.

41:12.304 --> 41:14.264
- What the fuck?
- And Frank Hooper

41:14.515 --> 41:16.141
that isn't your real name, is it?

41:16.266 --> 41:17.726
- You're Luka's guy.
- Luka who?

41:18.060 --> 41:19.269
But that's all history.

41:19.311 --> 41:20.854
The fun part is the future.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.441
That's what brings us things
we can charge you with now.

41:24.483 --> 41:27.820
We either have a fingerprint,
surveillance video

41:28.070 --> 41:30.406
or snitch willing to testify against you.

41:30.447 --> 41:33.325
Everything from obstruction to conspiracy.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.369
In the case of Margaret Ruth Bernhardt

41:35.661 --> 41:39.373
given her participation in a robbery
that left four people dead

41:40.290 --> 41:41.417
it's the brass ring.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.252
Murder in the first.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.005
The choice is simple, people.

41:46.797 --> 41:48.841
You cooperate and help us take down Luka

41:49.633 --> 41:50.509
or you go to jail.

41:52.886 --> 41:54.096
You know what you're doing?

41:54.138 --> 41:55.973
You know what we call it
in the confidence world?

41:56.306 --> 41:57.766
It's called an urban cowboy.

41:57.808 --> 42:00.769
It's all hat and no cattle.

42:01.353 --> 42:05.607
You have nothing,
so you're trying to intimidate us

42:05.649 --> 42:07.067
with all this razzle-dazzle.

42:07.109 --> 42:08.527
I'll give you some razzle-dazzle.

42:08.569 --> 42:10.863
If you had anything, you would charge us

42:10.904 --> 42:13.782
and you would suspend prosecution
pending cooperation.

42:13.824 --> 42:15.075
So here's what we're gonna do.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.120
We'll do our job, you do your job,
and we'll see who wins.

42:18.162 --> 42:20.539
How about we just tell Luka
how you're planning to fuck him over?

42:20.581 --> 42:22.916
You all go to the tub, snap, crackle, pop.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.420
You don't think Luka already knows
that we might rip him off?

42:26.795 --> 42:28.005
He's got a guy right here.

42:28.047 --> 42:28.922
He's watching us.

42:29.673 --> 42:33.010
Frankly, I'm insulted
that you think we would fold so easily.

42:33.552 --> 42:36.138
So if you have nothing else,
we're gonna get back to work.

42:39.141 --> 42:42.561
Well, it seems Marius
has made the choice for all of you.

42:43.896 --> 42:46.106
Hope you're all prepared
to live with the consequences.

42:54.990 --> 42:55.866
So, Marius.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.452
Um, I'm curious.

42:59.036 --> 43:03.165
Uh, just when did the presence
of the FBI slip your mind?

43:04.291 --> 43:05.709
I was gonna tell you about the FBI.

43:05.793 --> 43:07.836
When?
When we're just about to go to trial?

43:08.587 --> 43:09.630
They don't have anything.

43:09.838 --> 43:10.923
- They don't?
- No.

43:11.673 --> 43:13.509
Let's see what Luka
has to say about that.

43:13.592 --> 43:16.053
Luka already knows that they're watching.

43:16.678 --> 43:19.098
Oh, he knows, but we don't?

43:19.139 --> 43:20.974
- Well, you do now.
- Oh, I do now?

43:21.016 --> 43:21.892
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

43:22.476 --> 43:23.811
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Let's go?

43:23.852 --> 43:25.187
Wait, wait, where you going, man?

43:29.191 --> 43:32.027
It's good you aren't speaking to me.
That way, I can talk, and you can listen.

43:34.655 --> 43:36.615
Your aunt was right about one thing.

43:37.491 --> 43:38.951
You're not a child anymore.

43:39.993 --> 43:45.624
It's time you knew why my relationship
with Maggie is what it is.

43:50.712 --> 43:52.673
A few years after Pete's father died

43:53.549 --> 43:57.136
your aunt took up with a guy named Derek.

43:57.761 --> 44:00.264
He was a crook she had met
through our family business.

44:00.681 --> 44:04.268
When Derek went to jail
on a rather large charge

44:04.309 --> 44:07.354
your Aunt Maggie bailed him out
without collateral

44:08.147 --> 44:09.481
and without asking us

44:10.357 --> 44:13.485
ran with him to California,
dragging little Pete along with her.

44:14.153 --> 44:15.571
The cops caught up with them

44:16.363 --> 44:20.075
Derek went to prison,
and Maggie never forgave me.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.537
How did the cops find them?

44:24.204 --> 44:27.207
I got an address off the letters
Maggie sent to Lila.

44:28.917 --> 44:31.044
My mum gave up Aunt Maggie?

44:31.503 --> 44:32.379
No.

44:33.797 --> 44:35.716
She was hiding the letters.
I found them.

44:36.925 --> 44:39.595
When Lila learned what I'd done,
she was furious.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.597
Lost all trust in me.

44:42.264 --> 44:43.807
We were never the same after that.

44:46.685 --> 44:51.106
At times, I thought about trying to...
patch things up, but I didn't know how.

44:53.358 --> 44:57.738
When she died, my chance to ever do so
died with her.

45:04.995 --> 45:08.749
Because of what your aunt did,
I lost both my daughters

45:08.790 --> 45:14.379
and I refuse to let any more of Maggie's
actions cost me my family again.

45:22.221 --> 45:24.932
So... what are we gonna do about it?

45:42.157 --> 45:45.035
So, why am I here?

45:46.662 --> 45:47.704
Your money's in trouble.

45:48.747 --> 45:49.623
How's that?

45:50.249 --> 45:53.293
To take care of it,
I made a deal with Luis Mercado

45:53.502 --> 45:55.087
to run it through his legit businesses.

45:55.462 --> 45:59.341
In exchange, I had to use some of it
to bond someone out for him.

46:00.133 --> 46:02.678
Now, he's trying to kill her.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.055
I don't see how that affects my money.

46:05.597 --> 46:07.975
You get the bond back,
whether she's dead or alive.

46:09.977 --> 46:11.979
How... how do you know that?

46:12.521 --> 46:14.481
The way I see it, it's a win-win-win.

46:14.523 --> 46:17.567
Let Luis have Valerie,
I get my money laundered, and...

46:18.110 --> 46:19.945
you no longer have to be my launderer.

46:21.154 --> 46:22.990
Why do you care about Valerie, anyway?

46:24.700 --> 46:25.742
She's a criminal.

46:27.494 --> 46:31.623
And I'm a bail bondswoman,
not an executioner.

46:31.957 --> 46:35.502
Uh, technically, you'd just be the guard
walking her to the execution.

46:36.378 --> 46:37.713
Nobody blames that guy.

46:39.298 --> 46:40.465
All I need is a location.

46:42.301 --> 46:43.302
And if I say no?

46:43.593 --> 46:46.888
- Then you're the only one who loses.
- What are you gonna do, kill me?

46:47.597 --> 46:48.515
Threaten my kids?

46:48.974 --> 46:51.351
Whoa, I would never do that.

46:52.519 --> 46:55.564
But that young guy, Colin,
or whatever his name is

46:56.523 --> 46:57.399
real go-getter.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.569
I thought it was the 50 grand
I got on Valerie's head

47:00.610 --> 47:03.322
but there's something else driving him.
It's like it's personal.

47:03.822 --> 47:05.449
You should see what he did
to my man Omar.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.951
Who knows what he might do to you?

47:09.953 --> 47:13.415
So... just tell me where Valerie is

47:14.207 --> 47:15.375
I call off the kid.

47:16.918 --> 47:18.295
Don't tell me where Valerie is?

47:18.670 --> 47:21.089
I'll call junior hitman
and tell him where you are.

47:22.215 --> 47:26.303
Well, then, I think I have a compromise.

47:32.559 --> 47:33.518
Fuck.

47:34.853 --> 47:35.729
Pshh.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.027
<i>Ta-da!</i>

47:42.069 --> 47:45.113
Bravo.

47:46.531 --> 47:47.491
That's good.

47:48.283 --> 47:49.159
Thank you.

47:49.368 --> 47:54.498
How? And don't give me fucking
"magician secret" bullshit.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.460
It's um, it's an inflatable sheet

47:58.585 --> 48:01.922
so CO2 cartridges fill ribs
that are in the sheet

48:02.381 --> 48:06.218
which mimics the shape of the buffalo
and we remove the buffalo

48:07.135 --> 48:10.347
uh, and then the sheet deflates
when someone pulls on it.

48:11.723 --> 48:15.102
- And how buffalo gets out of casino?
- We're still working on that.

48:16.311 --> 48:18.522
You gonna tell him now? Or should I?

48:19.147 --> 48:20.023
Tell me what?

48:20.065 --> 48:21.691
Well, there's a little bit
of a bump in the road.

48:21.817 --> 48:22.901
Ha, "bump."

48:23.193 --> 48:25.278
More like the front range of the Himalayas.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.907
It's the, um... it's the FBI.

48:28.949 --> 48:30.534
Fucking FBI.

48:30.700 --> 48:31.576
Not new.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.871
Well, I know FBI. This is different.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.082
To make the buffalo disappear

48:37.374 --> 48:39.793
Marius had to make a loud noise
to distract us.

48:40.293 --> 48:43.755
To get the FBI's head to swivel,
take a nuclear blast.

48:45.507 --> 48:50.679
Well, I fool big organisation before.

48:51.054 --> 48:54.891
I fool four to get 15 million out
of Yugoslavia.

48:55.642 --> 49:00.355
That's Albanians, Italians, Serbians,
and Montenegrins.

49:00.772 --> 49:04.109
All due respect, Luka, this is the FBI

49:04.151 --> 49:06.403
not some Balkan government
in the middle of a war.

49:10.031 --> 49:11.158
Not government.

49:12.325 --> 49:13.201
Mafia.

49:14.995 --> 49:16.288
Very sophisticated.

49:16.329 --> 49:20.709
United Nations send 15 million to Balkan
to buy medicines during war.

49:21.668 --> 49:24.379
Money intercepted by general.

49:24.713 --> 49:26.339
Goran Bobetchko.

49:27.090 --> 49:29.551
This is a bad man.

49:31.136 --> 49:33.138
But it's too much money

49:33.346 --> 49:38.518
for Bobetchko to sneak out by himself,
so he needs partners.

49:39.853 --> 49:42.939
Here is plan.
Albanian mafia get money to coast.

49:43.440 --> 49:47.027
Montenegrin mafia sail money
from coast to Italy.

49:47.277 --> 49:48.862
Only, here is problem.

49:50.030 --> 49:53.492
Montenegrins, they don't have a boat,
but they know me

49:54.409 --> 49:58.121
so we load money
onto Papa's squid boat

49:58.163 --> 50:01.583
and Bobetchko sail off to Italy with me.

50:02.167 --> 50:03.460
We land...

50:04.669 --> 50:08.423
and I run into town to buy food and wine

50:08.465 --> 50:11.343
you know, to celebrate, and I keep going.

50:12.844 --> 50:15.722
Bobetchko go to look for money
on Papa's squid boat.

50:17.057 --> 50:18.767
Oh! No money!

50:20.685 --> 50:22.771
Money on other boat.

50:23.021 --> 50:25.524
Luka's boat, heading to New York City.

50:27.776 --> 50:29.569
I was own decoy.

50:31.238 --> 50:32.489
Do same here.

50:35.033 --> 50:36.993
FBI want me.

50:37.536 --> 50:41.081
FBI think I have money, they will follow.

50:41.581 --> 50:45.210
So you lead the FBI away
while Marius steals the buffalo.

50:45.752 --> 50:49.548
Well, we do have a second buffalo,
which is good.

50:50.340 --> 50:52.676
We would need a second build.

50:52.717 --> 50:55.512
We only have, uh, three nights to be ready.

50:55.804 --> 50:56.721
Why then?

50:57.180 --> 50:58.390
There's a woman at the casino.

50:58.431 --> 50:59.891
She works there, she knows me.

51:00.225 --> 51:01.518
We have to go on her days off.

51:02.644 --> 51:03.520
It's doable.

51:04.563 --> 51:05.522
I think it's doable.

51:08.567 --> 51:09.609
Not asking.

51:10.277 --> 51:11.278
Saying.
