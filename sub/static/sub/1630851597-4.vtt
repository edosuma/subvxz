00:11.276 --> 00:13.679
So I know you've been

00:11.276 --> 00:13.679

00:13.712 --> 00:16.483
So there's these fun little

00:13.712 --> 00:16.483
videos that people do.

00:16.515 --> 00:18.684
They're called ASMR videos,

00:16.515 --> 00:18.684
okay?

00:18.718 --> 00:20.320
- What is it?

00:18.718 --> 00:20.320
- So it's like,

00:20.353 --> 00:22.856
you make, like, a bunch

00:20.353 --> 00:22.856
of, like, small sounds, right?

00:22.888 --> 00:25.992
So you're gonna whisper the

00:22.888 --> 00:25.992
same word over and over again,

00:26.260 --> 00:27.393
and I'm gonna record it.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.393
- Mm-hmm.

00:27.426 --> 00:28.460
- And then we'll do, like--

Like that.

00:30.300 --> 00:31.131

00:31.164 --> 00:32.664
- And you do that into

00:31.164 --> 00:32.664
the microphone

00:32.698 --> 00:35.167
and apparently it's supposed

00:32.698 --> 00:35.167
to be soothing.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.603
Stop.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.603
- What?

00:36.636 --> 00:37.603

00:37.637 --> 00:39.390

05:22.555 --> 05:25.225
and the breaststroke.

05:25.257 --> 05:28.194
Let me just tell you, you're

05:25.257 --> 05:28.194
gonna be so good at that.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.461
- I don't like it.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.398
<i>[mischievous music]</i>

05:31.430 --> 05:34.199
- You been doing swim classes

05:31.430 --> 05:34.199
for a long time.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.903
- It's too hard.

- Listen, honey,

05:38.709 --> 05:39.639
we don't want to make you

05:38.709 --> 05:39.639
do something

05:39.673 --> 05:42.750
that you don't necessarily

05:39.673 --> 05:42.750
want to do.

05:42.750 --> 05:43.843
But we also don't want you

05:42.750 --> 05:43.843
to quit

05:43.877 --> 05:46.680
just because something

05:43.877 --> 05:46.680
gets hard.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.682
Okay, I know my child

05:46.713 --> 05:48.682
well enough to know

05:48.715 --> 05:50.783
that there are other issues

05:48.715 --> 05:50.783
here.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.319
- Okay, so then we'll just push

05:50.817 --> 05:53.319
the pause button on swimming

05:53.353 --> 05:55.221
until we can figure out

05:53.353 --> 05:55.221
what the issue is.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.223
- I just don't know

05:55.254 --> 05:57.223
what's going on here.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.259
- Now, if there's something

05:57.257 --> 05:59.259
else that you want to do

05:59.292 --> 06:02.279
that you might like to do

05:59.292 --> 06:02.279
better than swimming,

06:02.279 --> 06:03.629
then I'm open to you

06:02.279 --> 06:03.629
doing that.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.699
But if you start it,

06:03.663 --> 06:06.699
you're gonna finish it.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.867
- Yep, I agree.

All right, well,

06:07.901 --> 06:09.802
there is that karate class

06:09.836 --> 06:12.137
that those parents at your

06:09.836 --> 06:12.137
school were talking about.

Chloe?

06:14.341 --> 06:17.110

07:09.290 --> 07:11.297
when our anniversary is.

- You actually wore that

07:11.331 --> 07:14.339
on your first date?

07:14.670 --> 07:16.536
- That's what I was about

07:14.670 --> 07:16.536
to say, but I just

07:16.569 --> 07:18.170
didn't want to hurt

Second off, I'm pretty sure

07:21.410 --> 07:24.610
that is our first date.

I remember how good I looked

07:24.644 --> 07:27.146

It's only been one year.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.257
We haven't even had one yet.

- Listen, just pretend that

07:37.290 --> 07:39.858
every day is your anniversary.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.827
What you need to say is,

"You know what?

07:41.860 --> 07:44.970
It's like a fresh start

- I feel like

07:48.802 --> 07:50.637
I'm learning a lot here.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.105

07:50.670 --> 07:52.105
I have to do that,

So tomorrow

07:59.178 --> 08:01.139

08:03.550 --> 08:06.519
So now what do you do?

08:06.860 --> 08:08.879
- I'm not sure yet.

08:46.826 --> 08:50.960
it was parent participation.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.298
- No, you didn't.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.700
- I'm sure I mentioned that.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.700
- Or this parent

08:53.732 --> 08:56.903
would have said

08:53.732 --> 08:56.903
he wasn't participating.

No socks allowed.

Do you really think that I

Of course

14:44.384 --> 14:45.719

16:01.461 --> 16:02.528
with Emmy at tennis.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.763
- I'm that type of guy.

I'm like the day before--

16:03.797 --> 16:05.498
I'm the week before.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.815
- That's our anniversary.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.815
- That's not our anniversary.

16:21.847 --> 16:22.881
- Yeah, that is.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.417
- Our first kiss

16:22.916 --> 16:24.417
is our anniversary.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.518
- No.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.885
- Y'all can figure out

16:25.552 --> 16:26.885
your date later.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.879
Can we please go putt-putt?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.688
- Well, I feel like

16:28.120 --> 16:29.688
I'm a little overdressed

16:29.722 --> 16:31.323
for putt-putt.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.323
- Have you ever played with us?

- No.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.812
that I'm sorry about karate.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.614
with you.

We don't quit things

16:54.647 --> 16:57.683

16:57.716 --> 16:59.485
don't like something.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.485
- Exactly.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.121
Because there's been things

16:59.519 --> 17:02.121
that, after one or two times,

17:02.154 --> 17:03.490
I didn't really love.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.157
You know, kind of like

17:03.523 --> 17:05.157

17:09.662 --> 17:11.597

But I don't think

17:20.140 --> 17:22.442
we have the full story

17:22.474 --> 17:25.377
of what happened

17:22.474 --> 17:25.377
at swimming, do we?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.614
You want to tell us

17:25.412 --> 17:27.614
what really happened?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.782
- I'm scared 'cause there's

17:27.646 --> 17:29.782
a test coming up.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.317
Dad, I didn't want

17:29.816 --> 17:31.317
to let you down

17:31.351 --> 17:33.529
'cause you said Chrisleys

17:31.351 --> 17:33.529
are great swimmers.

- Okay.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.189
- You've made

17:34.153 --> 17:36.189
so much progress.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.157
- Honey,

17:36.221 --> 17:38.157
you will never let me down.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.292
When Chloe said she didn't want

17:38.191 --> 17:40.292
to disappoint me,

17:40.326 --> 17:41.961
I mean, that made me feel sad.

17:42.619 --> 17:44.564
Because the last thing I want

17:42.619 --> 17:44.564
is for her to feel pressure

17:44.596 --> 17:45.932
over something that I've said.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.567
- Right,

17:45.964 --> 17:47.567
and what's most important

17:47.599 --> 17:49.868
is that Chloe knows

17:47.599 --> 17:49.868
that we're proud of her.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.720
- Amen, sister.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.405
- Listen, honey.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.808
If things are challenging

17:53.440 --> 17:55.808
or they're scary,

17:55.842 --> 17:57.176
what do we do as a family?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.813
We work through it together.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.681
- Yes.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.681
- I do miss swimming,

18:01.714 --> 18:04.683
but everybody else has been

18:01.714 --> 18:04.683
moving up to the next level

18:04.718 --> 18:05.684
and I haven't yet.

18:05.719 --> 18:07.354
- The word is "yet."

18:07.386 --> 18:09.622
Because you're getting there,

18:07.386 --> 18:09.622
okay?

18:09.655 --> 18:10.856
- Okay.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.856
- All right,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.558
so we're gonna give that

18:10.890 --> 18:12.558
swimming another try?

- Yeah.
