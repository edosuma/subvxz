WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.208
We walk away from this.
We do not run.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.430
Act normal.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.209
I keep seeing him.

00:12.270 --> 00:14.226
Kate, you'll make
yourself crazy.

00:14.270 --> 00:16.579
I'm sorry I wrecked
your plans the other night.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.838
I just wanted to
treat you right.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.964
I'd hate it if folks
thought we were waiting for
soldiers to pick us up.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.669
What do they call them
patriotutes?

00:24.720 --> 00:26.847
I could die now and
I wouldn't care.

00:26.890 --> 00:29.063
My soldier.

00:29.110 --> 00:30.498
Go Betty call the nurse.

00:30.550 --> 00:32.108
Take me to the hospital.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.116
Lorna, she's a strong woman.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.060
You stay away from my wife.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.074
Do your best and join the rest! [like a jingle]

00:46.080 --> 00:49.129
Don't be Hitler's helper!
[like a jingle]

01:00.580 --> 01:02.616
What kind of recruitment
office is this?

01:02.670 --> 01:04.092
So I speak Italian?!

01:04.150 --> 01:06.755
When's someone gonna see
that as a good thing?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.313
When the war is over.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.531
I make bombs that
bash away Mussolini.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.626
Where do you think
my loyalties lie?

01:12.680 --> 01:15.501
Decision's outa my hands,
Mr. Moretti.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.687
So did you settle on a
recipe for your new
life-skills seminar?

01:22.730 --> 01:24.721
Yes! It's practical
and easy.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.726
The girls are all wanting tips
for juggling work and home.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.647
Thanks to you, Victory
Munitions will draw new
recrUIts In droves.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.738
Oh, it's just a few
after-hours classes

01:32.780 --> 01:35.476
to make the factory more
appealing to girls.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.397
Well, you're certainly
playing your part!

01:38.440 --> 01:39.748
I suppose I am.

01:39.790 --> 01:42.133
If this goes well,
Mr. Aikins may have me

01:42.180 --> 01:43.579
supervise the whole
workshop series.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.919
You ask me, it's a sad day
when you have to teach girls

01:46.970 --> 01:49.018
how to make their way
around a kitchen.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.530
Well don't hold dinner, I'm
going to work late tonight!

01:56.720 --> 02:00.247
Hey, Handsome!
How'd you make out?

02:00.290 --> 02:02.679
Do a girl a favour
and spread the word.

02:02.730 --> 02:04.152
Sign up and ship out!

02:04.210 --> 02:05.814
Take a couple.

02:05.860 --> 02:08.078
Come on, Marco pass them
out to your friends!

02:08.120 --> 02:11.419
Don't be Hitler's helper!
[like a jingle]

02:11.470 --> 02:14.860
You wanna watch your mouth.

02:14.910 --> 02:19.609
Easy tiger. We all know Marco's
a war hero waiting to happen.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.082
So he should enlist.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.176
He keeps trying,
they won't let him.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.174
Why not?

02:24.230 --> 02:26.130
I don't know because
he's Italian.

02:26.180 --> 02:31.015
Still got his father cooped up
in that internment camp.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.921
You sure you're not
taking on too much?

02:36.980 --> 02:38.140
It's been two months.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.328
Doctor says it's good
for me to get out.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.114
What about trying those
life-skills at home?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.980
Seems you don't
like being here.

02:48.030 --> 02:52.683
I'm trying my best, Bob.
Really I am.

02:52.730 --> 02:56.769
If I'm not home by six,
there's stew in the icebox.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.086
See you tonight.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.821
Missed you on this
morning's ride.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.182
Figured the best way to fight
the Axis today was to sleep in.

03:12.230 --> 03:14.312
What happened to
you last night?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.578
Game five of the Stanley Cup!

03:16.630 --> 03:20.191
Some soldier boy was
buying the rounds.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.845
Pace yourself, the Leafs
may be on a roll.

03:22.890 --> 03:25.279
...reports that
Domestic Production
[Radio]

03:25.330 --> 03:28.982
must rise by as much as 30%
if the country hopes
[Radio]

03:29.030 --> 03:31.112
to meet increasing demand.
[Radio]

03:31.160 --> 03:33.549
All Canadians need to step up
[Radio]

03:33.600 --> 03:35.943
and put their shoulder
to the wheel. [Radio]

03:37.730 --> 03:39.550
What I said back there,

03:39.610 --> 03:42.568
I had no idea your father was
locked up in Petawawa.

03:42.610 --> 03:43.827
I want to apologize.

03:43.870 --> 03:46.430
Why? It's not like
you put him in there.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.779
What'd they take him in for?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.786
My parents ran a
fireworks company,

03:51.840 --> 03:54.741
government doesn't like
Italians who can blow
things up.

03:54.790 --> 03:57.918
Plus he was part of a listed
club, Sons of Italy.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.666
That's the one-two punch,
sees a good man behind bars.

04:00.710 --> 04:02.268
What did the judge say?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.537
What judge?

04:03.590 --> 04:05.490
Three hours after
MUSSOIlnl declared war,

04:05.540 --> 04:09.670
the RCMP came to our house
and cuffed him, dragged him
off like a dog.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.062
For questioning they said.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.930
Took us three months to find
out he was in Petawawa.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.639
Marco. That's awful.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.204
They said he should
get a hearing by
winter; if he's lucky.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.115
There must be something
you can do.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.297
There should be.
But there isn't.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.209
Cooking workshop?

04:29.260 --> 04:30.340
Count me out.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.470
I've got better things
to do tonight,

04:32.530 --> 04:33.827
like swish out my undies.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.348
No big deal, making do with
a bit less sugar.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.573
I can already
boil an egg.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.838
It'll get worse, you can bet.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.531
They'll start rationing
milk, butter, coffee.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.274
Coffee?!

04:44.320 --> 04:45.844
Even meat.

04:45.890 --> 04:48.063
My father said they'll bring
in restrictions by degrees,

04:48.110 --> 04:49.270
so there's no mass-panic.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.753
Maybe I could use a
few helpful hints.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.505
You're off the beam,
Andrews.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.506
It must've slipped,
that's all.

05:03.860 --> 05:04.554
McRae

05:09.910 --> 05:11.252
If I didn't know better,

05:11.310 --> 05:13.824
I'd say I smelled
drink on that girl.

05:13.870 --> 05:15.428
Kate?

05:15.480 --> 05:18.483
No, I mean, she may have had a
beer with friends last night

05:18.530 --> 05:19.519
but that's all.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.184
She's a Christian
and all that.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.834
Have her deliver this to supply.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.623
And keep her on inventory till
she's got her wits about her.

05:47.080 --> 05:53.599
Careful, I seen Wally
mark his bottle.

05:53.650 --> 05:57.347
You been thirsty
since you got back.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.392
Your Mother. I heard
she passed.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.783
Yeah, well, my life goes on.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.832
Your life should do
more than just go on.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.440
I make my own way,

06:08.490 --> 06:10.663
do what I want.

06:10.710 --> 06:15.841
You got to walk
the lonesome valley

06:15.890 --> 06:20.634
You got to walk it
by yourself

06:20.680 --> 06:21.760
Come on.

06:21.810 --> 06:29.034
Nobody else can
walk it for you...

06:29.080 --> 06:31.469
What's the matter, Churchmouse,
devil got your tongue?

06:31.520 --> 06:36.389
I am no churchmouse,
you got that.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.819
Yes I do.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.959
Cooking seminar to begin
in twenty minutes.
[Intercom]

06:55.020 --> 06:59.195
This dish is surprisingly
delicious and economical too.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.060
W_ith nationwide
rationing starting,

07:01.110 --> 07:03.715
we all must_learn to
make do With less.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.499
Now I know what
you're thinking,

07:05.550 --> 07:08.155
how can I put another
creature's tongue in my mouth?

07:08.210 --> 07:10.075
First, he's gotta
buy me a drink.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.078
But I tell you, beef
tongue is certain to be

07:13.120 --> 07:14.849
available and cheap.

07:14.910 --> 07:17.686
Follow this recipe and
your family will think

07:17.740 --> 07:19.253
they're eating sirloin.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.779
Or dog-food.

07:23.050 --> 07:30.388
Now you add two
fistfuls of bread crumbs,

07:30.450 --> 07:35.183
a minced onion, an egg.

07:35.230 --> 07:38.233
Season with salt,
a little pepper,

07:38.280 --> 07:39.975
a dash of worcestershire

07:40.020 --> 07:42.329
and if you're feeling
particularly daring,

07:42.370 --> 07:46.022
a half a cup of ketchup!

07:46.070 --> 07:48.026
Then squish it all together,

07:48.070 --> 07:51.540
and shape it in a well
greased pan,

07:51.600 --> 07:55.024
pop it in the oven, medium.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.901
For hour and presto!

07:57.950 --> 08:01.863
A delicious, and
nutritious meal.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.822
I'm sticking with
boiled eggs.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.599
Don't forget next time,

08:06.660 --> 08:09.436
we'll explore the
wonders of tapioca!

08:14.360 --> 08:16.396
I promise you, Mr. Aikins,
those girls

08:16.450 --> 08:20.011
will one day thank me
for that recipe.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.665
Besides, Rome wasn't
built in a day.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.144
Except they got to eat
spaghetti and drink vino

08:25.200 --> 08:26.713
while they were
building it.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.978
Well what do you
want me to do?

08:29.030 --> 08:30.679
The "Gee-Co" plant gives
tap-dance lessons.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.938
Do I look like someone
who tap-dances?

08:32.990 --> 08:37.723
No. And that's what
I'm getting at.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.642
you can't help them all.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.419
Marco Moretti is a
good person.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.163
And his family's
being torn apart.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.256
We're at war, Gladdy.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.995
His father may well be
locked up for good reason.

08:51.050 --> 08:53.268
We can't have enemies
of the state running

08:53.310 --> 08:55.005
free within our borders.

08:55.050 --> 08:56.915
It's flagrant prejudice the
Italians, they've been
targeted.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.131
No they haven't. We've interned
Germans, Ukrainians, Japanese...

08:59.190 --> 09:01.966
You're the one, taught me
about noblesse oblige.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.659
To whom much is given...

09:03.710 --> 09:05.098
Much is asked, yes.

09:05.150 --> 09:08.142
Only you're always
the one asking.

09:08.190 --> 09:11.580
Locked up for two years
and all this man wants

09:11.630 --> 09:13.063
is his day in court.

09:13.110 --> 09:16.159
All I'm "asking" is for you
to pick up the phone

09:16.200 --> 09:17.451
and call Uncle Ward.

09:17.510 --> 09:19.375
The Ministry of Defense
will not involve itself

09:19.420 --> 09:20.637
with this political minefield.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.204
Oh, it's nothing for him
to schedule a hearing,

09:23.250 --> 09:25.332
and you know it, Daddy.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.941
So you'll make the call?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.776
And I can give the
Moretti's some good news?

09:31.830 --> 09:34.082
If you promise stay
away from that family.

09:34.130 --> 09:37.042
I don't want my
daughter cavorting with
the wrong people.

09:37.090 --> 09:38.785
What do you want
in return?

09:38.830 --> 09:40.616
It's your mother's
birthday on Sunday.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.571
I have nothing to
say to her.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.181
How come uniting this family
is so important to you?

09:46.230 --> 09:47.481
What about your own?

09:47.540 --> 09:49.701
Why is everything with you
is a horse trade?

09:49.760 --> 09:52.627
'Cause I am the block you're
chipped from, Gladdy.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.379
Detroit fails to get a shot, the puck rolls out to centre.
[Radio]

10:03.420 --> 10:06.503
Gets it he shots ahead
[Radio]

10:06.560 --> 10:10.075
And here's a break away.
He shots, he scores.
[Radio]

10:10.130 --> 10:19.391
Cheers

10:19.440 --> 10:21.340
Three-nothing, the Leafs
are pounding them!

10:21.400 --> 10:24.005
A team coming back from
three losses like that?

10:24.050 --> 10:25.358
It's never been done before.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.925
So, Maple Leafs won the
Stanley Cup?

10:27.970 --> 10:29.312
Not yet.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.533
But we're tied for it just
gotta win one more game.

10:31.580 --> 10:32.319
Go Leafs!

10:36.070 --> 10:37.367
Wanna dance?

10:37.410 --> 10:38.752
Let's cut it.

10:44.550 --> 10:46.598
Honey, it's okay.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.029
We've been together three
months, who's gonna care?

10:57.130 --> 10:59.030
Something wrong?

10:59.090 --> 11:03.129
Time for my pillow.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.523
I feel like the
walking dead.

11:05.570 --> 11:06.969
Leafs won today, Betty.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.261
It's a damned wonder.

11:08.310 --> 11:12.314
Enough to make a guy think
anything could happen.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.272
Yeah, it's like Hitler.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.232
He thinks he's won, but
the series isn't over.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.329
I'll get my coat.

11:22.370 --> 11:24.588
I wasn't talking about Hitler.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.072
My last batch.

11:34.120 --> 11:39.729
No more lead for toys anymore,
just tanks and bullets.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.293
Thought you were staying late.

11:41.350 --> 11:46.049
The workshop was... abbreviated.

11:46.090 --> 11:50.003
But I'm not giving up. Not yet.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.610
That's the stew
from the icebox?

11:52.660 --> 11:59.145
No. It's ground sirloin.
From work. It's free.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.498
Alright.

12:02.190 --> 12:03.270
Thank you.

12:07.110 --> 12:10.068
What do you think?

12:10.120 --> 12:11.155
It's not bad.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.819
I told you to stay out of this!

12:17.860 --> 12:19.293
I thought you'd be grateful

12:19.340 --> 12:20.898
I got your father a hearing.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.828
Yeah in two days!
That's too soon.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.292
What's the matter?
[Italian]

12:25.350 --> 12:27.648
She got a hearing at
Petawawa for Papa.
[Italian]

12:27.700 --> 12:29.736
Yes?
[Italian]

12:29.790 --> 12:31.439
What are you afraid of?

12:31.480 --> 12:35.701
My father's a stubborn,
hot-tempered old man with
no lawyer!

12:38.320 --> 12:41.574
Maybe we get it
pospogna Ma. [Italian]

12:41.630 --> 12:43.495
Pospogna, Postponed it?

12:43.540 --> 12:46.589
Why? You've been waiting
nearly two years.

12:46.630 --> 12:47.938
Try, Marco!

12:47.980 --> 12:50.323
The train alone takes a
full day to get there!

12:50.370 --> 12:51.325
So don't take the train.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.895
Well I don't have a car.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.163
But you do, though,
don't you?

13:00.210 --> 13:02.815
Well... in a manner
of speaking,

13:02.860 --> 13:04.509
I mean, it is
my fianc's...

13:04.560 --> 13:06.255
Good enough for me.
You drive.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.860
I've got a job. I got
you the hearing,

13:08.910 --> 13:10.172
isn't that good enough?

13:10.220 --> 13:12.211
It's no good if I
can't get there.

13:12.260 --> 13:15.172
This is our one chance to
bring my father home.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.222
We simply drive to Petawawa.

13:17.270 --> 13:19.909
Marco, she is our angel.
[Italian]

13:19.970 --> 13:21.483
My mom's, been praying...

13:30.410 --> 13:33.368
First thing tomorrow morning.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.414
Thank God I haven't cashed
in those gas rations.

13:41.470 --> 13:42.209
Thank you.

13:47.950 --> 13:51.989
[Speaking Italian]

14:00.400 --> 14:03.449
You sure tied one
on last night.

14:03.490 --> 14:11.363
What is it, "never mix
never worry?"

14:11.410 --> 14:13.401
You can't keep this up.

14:13.460 --> 14:17.499
I'm having a good time.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.633
Keeps me from remembering
things I wanna forget.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.240
Running away won't fix it.

14:23.290 --> 14:25.155
Your dad is dead.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.986
We agreed, Betty,
a normal life,

14:28.040 --> 14:29.428
from here on in.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.597
That's what I want...
just like you.

14:31.650 --> 14:36.565
A good job and a
guy like Ivan...

14:36.610 --> 14:38.953
Go wash your face.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.171
Come on.

14:46.180 --> 14:48.876
Marco- I'll make sure he
downplays the Sons of Italy.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.012
Gladys- My father says its
fascist hotbed.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.278
Marco- Well my father was too
busy playing bocce

14:53.320 --> 14:55.276
and singing Verdi to plot war.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.108
Gladys- Okay well, what
ifI taught him to sing
"God Save the King"

14:59.150 --> 15:03.154
Hmmm... will it be a brooch
from Soldier Frank

15:03.200 --> 15:06.499
or earrings from Airman Georgie.

15:06.550 --> 15:09.508
Both Moretti and Witham booked
off without permission.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.074
Great, now I'm short
in every department.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.079
I tell you, Spring hits and
folks want to go pick daisies.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.876
I could've used some
support yesterday.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.174
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corbett, but
the seminars are supposed

15:28.230 --> 15:30.130
to attract women to
work the factory

15:30.190 --> 15:32.090
not turn them into
vegetarians.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.098
I'm providing valuable
life-skills.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.050
You ask a girl what
she wants?

15:37.110 --> 15:40.796
'Cause I tell you, it
ain't beef tongue.

15:40.850 --> 15:43.284
And I suppose you think
you could do better.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.104
Yeah. I do.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.718
So what are you saying?

15:46.770 --> 15:50.069
I'm saying, I'm giving the
next life-skills seminar.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.554
Well that I'll want to see.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.600
We're Italian if _the
house was on fire,

16:01.650 --> 16:05.950
we wouldn't leave till
the pasta was served.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.218
We have made good time.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.429
She's excited.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.572
Seeing my father
means a lot to her.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.315
Have you heard
anything from him?

16:15.360 --> 16:18.227
His letters were censored.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.623
When our landlord saw
them stamped "POW,"

16:20.670 --> 16:22.149
he kicked us out.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.533
We moved three times
now in two years.

16:24.590 --> 16:26.888
Pops doesn't write anymore.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.669
That's truly awful.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.631
What judge won't take pity?

16:30.680 --> 16:33.763
He just has to convince them
he's learned from his mistakes.

16:33.810 --> 16:36.370
He not going to admit
something he didn't do.

16:36.430 --> 16:40.207
Well does he want to be right
or does he want to be free?

16:40.260 --> 16:42.865
I don't know Gladys,
which would you choose?

16:42.910 --> 16:46.038
He tells the Judge that the
police all made a big mistake?

16:46.090 --> 16:48.388
He'll be locked in that
place til kingdom-come.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.694
So last time was full-time?

16:51.740 --> 16:53.082
Full-time? No.

16:53.140 --> 16:58.055
Not really, not since...
well, since before the war.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.442
So... 1938?

16:59.490 --> 17:02.448
No. The Great War, 1915.
Ijoined up.

17:02.490 --> 17:04.105
And... did your duty.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.185
Yes. I did.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.708
But like they
say on the wireless,

17:07.760 --> 17:10.194
there's_no excuse for
not d0ing your part.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.491
Let's see,

17:11.550 --> 17:15.281
they need volunteers
to read to soldiers,

17:15.330 --> 17:18.151
Yeah I did my "volunteering"
when I went over to fight

17:18.210 --> 17:19.461
Jerry the first time.

17:19.510 --> 17:23.207
Growing up, I always thought
I'd be a machinist.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.515
After the war, though, folks
figured I wouldn't survive,

17:26.560 --> 17:28.869
no use in training a corpse,
eh?

17:28.910 --> 17:32.300
What I'm saying is,
I know things.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.738
I'm good with my hands...

17:33.790 --> 17:37.521
Most manual labor is
covered by women nowadays,

17:37.570 --> 17:39.174
except for the heaw stuff.

17:39.230 --> 17:42.188
And given your...
circumstances...

17:42.230 --> 17:46.838
No gimps, I get it.

17:46.890 --> 17:52.328
You know with those eyes, I
doubt you ever got to
serve... did you?

17:57.940 --> 18:00.158
There's a scrap-yard
west of the city,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.020
I can get you an interview.

18:02.080 --> 18:06.369
But the guys over there
might give you some guff.

18:06.430 --> 18:09.467
I handled the Hun,
I can handle some guff.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.953
Oh Ivan, you charmer.

18:24.750 --> 18:31.019
I saw your friend taking a nip
in the store-room yesterday.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.846
Something's not right
with that girl.

18:32.890 --> 18:35.233
What am I supposed
to do about it?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.328
A woman of faith,
lost her way.

18:37.370 --> 18:39.099
Church might do
her some good.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.721
Church? You gotta be kidding.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.635
All that God and Sinner
stuff's done

18:44.680 --> 18:46.728
more to damage her mind
than anything.

18:46.770 --> 18:48.499
She's never been
to my church.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.983
No. And she won't be.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.554
Well change your mind?
AME Assembly,

18:53.610 --> 18:57.387
I'll be giving the
homily this Sunday.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.658
No reservations necessary.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.918
Well I got pently of those.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.145
Marco- These are the
enemy aliens.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.408
Those red moons on their
backs".

19:16.450 --> 19:19.362
Yeah targets.

19:19.410 --> 19:22.061
Bull's-eyes. In case
they get any ideas.

19:22.110 --> 19:24.761
Hard to believe we're
still in Canada.

19:24.810 --> 19:26.061
[Speaking Italian]

19:26.120 --> 19:27.508
No mama.

19:38.300 --> 19:42.213
Afternoon, Officer, and
a lovely one at that.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.125
We're here to see Ciro Moretti.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.262
No entry without prior
authorization.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.221
Except we have
authorization.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.965
Mr. _Moretti has a
hearing tomorrow.

19:50.010 --> 19:52.183
And how do you know that?

19:52.230 --> 19:54.312
Hearings are strictly
conﬁdenﬁaL

19:54.360 --> 19:56.749
Same way I know how
under the law,

19:56.800 --> 19:59.268
Mr. Moretti is entitled
to representation.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.709
What's going on, what does
he want? [Italian]

20:01.760 --> 20:03.887
Miss, Ciro Moretti
has no such rights

20:03.940 --> 20:06.067
under the War Measures Act.

20:06.110 --> 20:07.418
Step out of the car.

20:08.770 --> 20:12.410
[Speaking Italian]

20:15.030 --> 20:18.852
My name is Gladys Witham.

20:18.910 --> 20:21.344
Witham.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.381
Witham Foods?

20:23.430 --> 20:26.251
Well I'm not sure what
that's supposed to mean,

20:26.310 --> 20:27.698
but I've already eaten.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.743
Ward Witham at the Ministry
of Defense is my uncle.

20:30.790 --> 20:34.442
He arranged Mr. Moretti's
heanng.

20:34.490 --> 20:36.879
And what role are you
playing in this?

20:36.930 --> 20:39.228
Sir, we just want
to see my father.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.497
We had reason to believe

20:40.540 --> 20:45.011
Hey did I ask you to
get out of the car?

20:45.060 --> 20:48.279
Both of you.
Back in the car!

20:48.330 --> 20:53.063
[Speaking Italian]

20:58.860 --> 21:00.987
Now what do we do?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.258
I've no idea.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.030
First I was afraid they
wouldn't let us in.

21:06.090 --> 21:10.129
Now I'm afraid they
won't let me leave.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.614
Now we all know co_ld cream
is a girl's best friend,

21:21.670 --> 21:23.831
but as women of industry,
our skin faces

21:23.890 --> 21:24.879
industrial-strength attacks.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.886
That's where lemon
jUice comes in.

21:26.930 --> 21:28.978
Sequeeze a little into your
nightly regiment

21:29.020 --> 21:31.329
to strip away the cordite
that yellows the skin

21:31.370 --> 21:35.329
and you'll sing like a canary
without looking like one!

21:35.380 --> 21:37.245
[Laughing]

21:37.290 --> 21:41.852
Doesn't that feel luscious?

21:41.900 --> 21:43.458
Now let's move onto make-up.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.900
None of us want to look
like a rusty hens either.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.998
But we can't slathe_r on
expenswe cosmetics

21:49.040 --> 21:50.996
and expect to make
it till payday.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.862
So I'll show you how a little
bit can go a long way.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.740
Can I have a volunteer?

21:56.790 --> 22:02.877
Mrs. Corbett?

22:13.410 --> 22:16.368
[Coughing]

22:27.990 --> 22:30.038
And who is this, your wife?
[Italian]

22:30.080 --> 22:31.513
Friend, only a friend.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.031
Sit down!

22:37.000 --> 22:39.139
No physical contact. No
passing of messages.

22:39.180 --> 22:41.489
English only.

22:41.530 --> 22:44.044
Any Italian, this interview
is over. Understood?

22:44.100 --> 22:46.056
English, Ma. Only English,
okay.

22:57.720 --> 23:02.635
You still look so beautiful.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.728
Me, I'm old now.

23:04.770 --> 23:06.078
Oh Ciro.

23:08.770 --> 23:13.389
Ciro, you need come home.

23:13.430 --> 23:15.421
The business,
it's good?

23:15.480 --> 23:18.699
Business...

23:18.740 --> 23:21.436
very good.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.300
Tomorrow is un'intervista.

23:23.350 --> 23:26.649
Very important, you
listen to Marco.

23:26.700 --> 23:32.093
Gianna, I think for myself.

23:32.140 --> 23:33.539
Those stupid bastards.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.016
No. Listen to Marco.

23:37.060 --> 23:38.971
Darling, it's important
you listen [Italian]

23:39.020 --> 23:40.066
What'd I tell you?!

23:40.110 --> 23:41.327
This interview is over.

23:41.370 --> 23:42.280
Hey! Hey!!!

23:42.330 --> 23:44.764
Marco, don't, stop.

23:44.810 --> 23:48.985
It's been two years since
they saw each other.

23:49.030 --> 23:51.021
Please.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.503
I'll take Mrs. Moretti
out to the hallway,

23:53.560 --> 23:56.427
give father and son a moment?

24:07.530 --> 24:10.135
Remember what we
talked about.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.056
Pa you okay?

24:19.100 --> 24:22.058
Pa, there's a hearing tomorrow.

24:22.110 --> 24:24.101
You're not gonna
have a lawyer.

24:24.150 --> 24:26.414
The judge is going to
ask you questions...

24:26.460 --> 24:29.020
Just give him simple answers,
in English.

24:29.070 --> 24:31.459
Tell him how much you
love the country,

24:31.510 --> 24:34.070
and support the war.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.942
Pa, there's some things
you can't talk about.

24:37.990 --> 24:40.129
Things you can't say.

24:40.170 --> 24:44.209
Pa, listen to me,
we love you.

24:44.260 --> 24:48.128
I know you can do this you're
a strong man, a good man.

24:48.180 --> 24:54.528
We want you back at home, we
wanna be a family again Pa.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.615
I love you.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.662
Come here.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.706
Now Vaseline under the lipstick
not only moistens,

25:03.760 --> 25:05.273
it protects your lips.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.881
And makes the colour last.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.760
Voil.

25:10.810 --> 25:14.325
Kissed by the sun not
mashed on by chemicals.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.769
I've already applied the blush,
Mrs. Corbett,

25:16.810 --> 25:19.370
no need to do the job for me.

25:25.910 --> 25:26.899
Bob!?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.758
What are you doing
in the dark?

25:46.800 --> 25:48.848
I've got a splitting
headache. Please...

25:53.200 --> 25:54.588
Another workshop?

25:54.640 --> 25:58.371
It wasn't mine.

25:58.420 --> 26:02.117
Bob, I have to wonder if
maybe you went out more,

26:02.160 --> 26:04.037
these attacks wouldn't
come so often.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.593
I have been going out,
Lorna.

26:05.650 --> 26:07.299
And I don't mean the Legion.

26:07.340 --> 26:09.513
It wasn't the
goddamned Legion.

26:09.560 --> 26:15.044
I've been looking
for a job, Lorna.

26:15.090 --> 26:18.264
"All shoulders to the wheel of
war" kind of thing.

26:18.310 --> 26:22.223
All shoulders except mine.

26:22.270 --> 26:26.138
I dragged my sorry ass down
to that scrap metal yard

26:26.190 --> 26:28.226
out in the west end
of the city.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.147
They didn't give me
the time of day.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.102
Sometimes I think_I should've
just lain in that field and...

26:34.150 --> 26:40.589
You didn't give up
and I'm damned glad.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.542
You know, Trev Murphy had
a stroke last month.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.295
With his son Boyd overseas,

26:46.340 --> 26:48.501
Pauline has put the
newsstand up for sale.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.549
No, no...

26:49.600 --> 26:51.295
I bet she'd sell the
business cheap.

26:51.340 --> 26:52.898
A cripple on the corner?

26:52.950 --> 26:54.508
Oh, Bob...

26:54.560 --> 26:57.859
I might as well be begging for
spare change with a tin cup.

27:00.480 --> 27:05.349
Butcher had a skirt steak,
last one, a miracle, I say.

27:05.400 --> 27:12.147
How about I'll cook it up
medium, won't be too tough?

27:12.190 --> 27:13.441
A night in.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.671
That's some face you got.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.499
It's a social club,
that's all!

27:29.560 --> 27:31.687
The Sons of Italy
are no fascists.

27:31.730 --> 27:34.381
What do they think we gonna
overthrow the government?

27:34.430 --> 27:37.081
I say whatever I want
it's a free country,

27:37.130 --> 27:38.995
I've done nothing wrong.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.691
Tell them you never went to
a meeting, never associated
with Blackshirts.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.265
We met, yes, we just talk...

27:44.310 --> 27:46.210
I never did nothing wrong.

27:46.270 --> 27:48.135
Pa, they know this,
they're not idiots.

27:48.180 --> 27:50.319
That's why they'll ask
you about Mussolini

27:50.360 --> 27:51.577
You don't know...

27:51.620 --> 27:54.316
Look they're going to
ask you about Mussolini,

27:54.360 --> 27:56.965
and when they do you
need to denounce him!

27:57.020 --> 28:00.148
I rot in prison, eat bad
food, work like a slave

28:00.200 --> 28:03.715
and you ask me to denounce
a man who put fresh meat

28:03.760 --> 28:06.285
on table of every Italian?
Gave medicine, doctors?

28:06.330 --> 28:08.412
I'm not going to
denounce a great man!

28:08.460 --> 28:09.324
Papa shut up!

28:09.380 --> 28:11.336
Fight them. Don't fight me.

28:11.380 --> 28:14.508
You make bombs that kill
Italians, what kind of man
kills his own people?

28:14.560 --> 28:16.551
I smell smoke,
they're listening!

28:16.600 --> 28:18.682
You bastards!

28:18.740 --> 28:21.163
We're finished here.

28:31.180 --> 28:34.138
You take my father,
you take his spirit, his mind!

28:34.190 --> 28:36.226
What's going on?
What're you doing?

28:36.270 --> 28:37.055
Ma!

28:37.100 --> 28:39.967
Viva L'Italia, Viva Il Duce!

28:40.020 --> 28:41.794
No Pa!

28:41.850 --> 28:43.056
We're detaining your friend...

28:43.110 --> 28:45.624
Put them under guard
both of them.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.442
Welcome to the party, soldier.

29:40.730 --> 29:43.551
Now tell me this was
a bad idea.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.990
Well it's swell,
it's real swell.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.382
Got your favorite.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.569
Onion and tomato.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.319
Can you stand it?

30:02.670 --> 30:05.537
Sweet as a rose.

30:12.890 --> 30:15.677
Boy they're doing
good out there.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.605
Look, if you don't want me,

30:30.650 --> 30:33.437
I want you. I do.
It's just...

30:36.130 --> 30:38.178
What?

30:38.220 --> 30:41.838
I said we'd take our time,
but...

30:41.880 --> 30:45.611
I was hoping to see a little
action before Hitler invades.

30:47.190 --> 30:51.627
Are you with me?

30:51.670 --> 30:56.278
There's a breakaway.
Goldham going right in.
[Radio]

30:56.330 --> 30:59.197
He shoots it. _He scores!
[Radio]

30:59.240 --> 31:01.322
Baby, I love you.

31:01.380 --> 31:04.679
After ten long years the Toronto Maple Leafs are minutes away,
[Radio]

31:04.730 --> 31:06.686
from winning the Stanley Cup,
folks.[Radio]

31:11.730 --> 31:14.381
Best present I got so far.

31:14.430 --> 31:16.694
It's enough to make
me want another go.

31:16.740 --> 31:18.992
Mmmm I love it, thank you.

31:19.050 --> 31:22.781
Comes from Paris,
or so I'm told.

31:22.830 --> 31:26.391
Never been there myself.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.489
Well, marching the
Champs Elyses

31:29.530 --> 31:31.964
after you kick out
the Nazis swine.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.147
Oh no, that won't be
me, kitten.

31:34.190 --> 31:37.535
Furthest I'll be going
is Vancouver Island.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.490
You're going to fight Japan?

31:39.540 --> 31:40.757
Not on your life.

31:40.810 --> 31:44.587
If they ship me overseas,
I'll desert.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.723
You mean you're one
of them cowards.

31:47.770 --> 31:52.469
I'm on your side. They got
me defending the home front.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.421
But you won't fight overseas.

31:54.470 --> 31:58.349
Hell no. And they
can't make me.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.389
I date soldiers,

32:02.440 --> 32:05.694
not cowards who swan about in
uniforms but won't fight.

32:05.740 --> 32:08.049
Get out!

32:08.100 --> 32:09.704
So I'm a Zombie.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.615
What are you?
You sleep with strangers

32:11.660 --> 32:14.959
and you take it out in
trade, there's a common
word for that too.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.408
Love!

32:16.450 --> 32:19.101
That's what I find in decent
men before they ship out.

32:19.150 --> 32:21.106
Jigger it any way you want,
sugan

32:21.150 --> 32:23.368
At least I know who I am.

32:23.410 --> 32:25.059
Do you?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.806
Because it seems to me,
I'm the only one who can
walk out of here

32:27.850 --> 32:30.853
with my head held high.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.288
Keep it.

32:32.340 --> 32:35.980
Luclq for you, your
friends will never see it.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.589
You can wear this secret under
your pretty dresses.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.273
There we go.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.342
Piece of garbage.

33:38.880 --> 33:43.010
Alright, alright.

33:51.290 --> 33:55.499
Good morning Ladies,
two of you can go now.

33:55.550 --> 33:57.063
Where's Marco?

33:57.120 --> 33:58.849
We're holding him for
questioning.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.151
"Questioning"

34:00.210 --> 34:02.815
that's what you told his
father two years ago.

34:02.860 --> 34:04.816
Whatever happened to "Innocent
till proven guilty?"

34:04.860 --> 34:06.122
We're at war, Miss Witham.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.070
I suggest you think about
whose side you're on.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.291
Marco is Canadian,
he's one of us.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.341
I won't_leave this
camp Without him.

34:12.390 --> 34:14.529
You've done one stupid
thing already.

34:14.570 --> 34:16.879
Let's avoid another.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.617
Sign out and leave.

34:20.660 --> 34:21.570
Where's a telephone?

34:21.620 --> 34:22.871
You're not making
a phone-call.

34:22.930 --> 34:25.740
Then I'm not leaving either.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.759
You should know, we're not
above interning a woman.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.360
You wouldn't dare lock me up.

34:32.410 --> 34:36.028
Oh, I'm not talking about you,
Miss Witham.

34:51.870 --> 34:55.431
Marco? Marco?

34:55.480 --> 34:56.378
Marco!?!

34:56.440 --> 34:58.658
It will be okay.
Come on.

35:06.840 --> 35:10.662
Kate? You weren't home when
I got in last night.

35:15.930 --> 35:18.751
What am I doing?

35:18.810 --> 35:22.769
I don't know?

35:22.810 --> 35:26.598
Something's wrong.

35:26.640 --> 35:30.679
With both of us.

35:30.730 --> 35:32.778
Get your clothes on.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.868
We're going out.

36:11.510 --> 36:16.072
Don't ever come back
here, Miss Witham.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.343
What happened?

36:19.390 --> 36:22.644
They brought in some guy to
question me all night.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.214
Then they called him out
for a phone call.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.956
And when he came back,
he told me to get out.

36:29.010 --> 36:30.136
Why?

36:30.180 --> 36:31.875
No idea.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.229
Guess they got what
they needed.

36:37.150 --> 36:40.756
Just drive.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.285
God's gift to us is his grace.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.808
A divine blessing,

36:54.860 --> 36:56.589
freely given.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.940
Grace with Mercy,
travel together.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.917
These two blessings
travel together,

37:09.960 --> 37:12.349
like two sisters.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.573
Grace cannot be bought.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.872
Grace cannot be earned.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.228
Why did you bring me here?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.793
Just listen.

37:20.840 --> 37:24.844
Grace is love without limit.

37:24.890 --> 37:26.938
Love without reason.

37:26.980 --> 37:29.062
God loves you,

37:29.110 --> 37:31.021
for your virtues,

37:31.070 --> 37:33.982
and for your sins.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.760
[Whistle]

37:37.820 --> 37:42.519
There's the Corbett whistle.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.903
Lor...

37:44.950 --> 37:46.952
Look at you...

37:47.000 --> 37:49.901
A coat of paint would sure
spruce it up nice.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.394
Needs a match, put it out
of its misery.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.908
Murphy let it go to
rack and ruin.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.655
Magazines he did
have on offer,

37:56.700 --> 37:58.258
were garbage.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.130
Were all organized wrong.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.999
He had a recipe
and sport rags,

38:02.060 --> 38:03.709
cheek by jowl.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.924
One thing you know
is your news.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.278
That's better.

38:12.550 --> 38:15.849
Whoever you are,
whereever you've been,

38:15.900 --> 38:17.891
He's at your side.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.285
He sees you.
He knows you.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.944
Accepts who you are.

38:22.990 --> 38:27.518
All he asks is that you
be true to your heart

38:27.560 --> 38:31.599
and accepts God's grace
within you.

38:33.960 --> 38:39.262
Just as I am

38:39.310 --> 38:49.276
I said Lord take me

38:50.930 --> 39:00.896
Just as I am

39:18.390 --> 39:21.473
Leon's saying a thing
or two.

39:25.140 --> 39:31.409
Mercy, Grace,
it's hogwash.

39:31.450 --> 39:33.839
It's a start, Kate.

39:33.890 --> 39:35.448
It's a way back.

39:35.500 --> 39:41.632
A child of God should be able
to grieve her father's death.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.116
Me, I feel nothing...

39:45.160 --> 39:48.027
except relief.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.641
That man can rot in hell
for all I care.

39:58.220 --> 39:59.869
Crap wartime rubber!

40:03.270 --> 40:04.749
"Viva Il Duce"?

40:04.790 --> 40:06.655
That hell-hole turned him.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.099
He didn't do anything.

40:08.140 --> 40:11.189
A free country doesn't lock a
man up for his thoughts.

40:11.230 --> 40:13.403
You defend him, they
throw you in jail.

40:13.450 --> 40:15.315
They can take away
your rights, Marco.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.918
They can take away
everything now.

40:16.970 --> 40:20.451
I can't help it.
He's my father.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.459
Like it or not,
he's blood.

40:28.990 --> 40:30.469
Hey!

40:30.510 --> 40:32.068
Hey.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.419
They are celebrating the
Stanley Cup win down at
the Gardens.

40:35.470 --> 40:37.074
Grab a sweater, let's go.

40:37.130 --> 40:37.812
I can't.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.474
It's supposed to be fun!

40:39.520 --> 40:43.479
I know, Ivan, but it isn't.
Not for me.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.693
What do you mean,
it's the Leafs!

40:45.740 --> 40:48.265
Look, you're a great guy.

40:48.310 --> 40:52.701
Betty stop. You're amazing.

40:52.750 --> 40:56.402
Last night was amzing.

40:56.450 --> 40:58.008
I'm gone on ya.

40:58.060 --> 41:00.051
I'm not.

41:00.100 --> 41:04.400
On you.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.621
I'm sorry, Ivan,
really I am.

41:06.680 --> 41:09.979
Do you know how many girls
would jump at this chance?

41:10.030 --> 41:13.545
We're meant for
other people Ivan.

41:13.600 --> 41:17.024
I have to follow my heart.

41:17.080 --> 41:19.036
I have to.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.900
I'm an idiot.

41:20.950 --> 41:22.474
No.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.215
Ivan!

41:31.790 --> 41:33.655
Hello, Daddy,

41:33.700 --> 41:35.873
Where's the Birthday girl?

41:35.920 --> 41:38.480
Powdering her nose.

41:40.010 --> 41:43.366
So, things work out
for your friend?

41:43.410 --> 41:45.492
Thanks to your
phone-call.

41:45.540 --> 41:47.019
What phone-call?

41:47.060 --> 41:49.108
To the camp. Petawawa.

41:49.150 --> 41:50.458
You went there?

41:50.500 --> 41:52.548
And I've learned my lesson.
Honestly, I have.

41:52.590 --> 41:54.114
Well, I made no phone-call.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.980
Somebody did.

41:56.030 --> 41:57.588
Was it Uncle Ward?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.505
Your friend is free.
You're home safe.

41:59.560 --> 42:04.338
Let's keep it that way.
Don't go sniffing.

42:04.390 --> 42:06.164
It's good of you to come.

42:06.210 --> 42:08.428
This will mean the world
to your mother.

42:08.480 --> 42:13.952
I know. That's why I came.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.448
The newsstand is perfect.

42:22.490 --> 42:25.277
Don't_blame me if our
savmgs get blown

42:25.320 --> 42:27.311
to smithe_reens in the
next Windstorm.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.497
Oh come, it's been
there twenty years

42:29.540 --> 42:30.586
it'll last another twenty.

42:30.630 --> 42:33.588
Still, we should take
out insurance.

42:33.630 --> 42:35.769
The day you find
a silver lining,

42:35.810 --> 42:37.630
I swear I'll drop
dead from shock.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.808
[Whistle]

42:40.860 --> 42:41.599
Is that...?

42:41.640 --> 42:47.169
[Whistle]

42:47.210 --> 42:48.427
Eugene".

42:49.650 --> 42:51.686
Eugene!

42:51.740 --> 42:52.820
Surprise, Ma.

42:57.660 --> 43:00.743
Oh Gene! Gene! It's you!

43:00.790 --> 43:02.223
In the flesh.

43:02.270 --> 43:03.965
Some kind of miracle,

43:05.490 --> 43:06.798
were you... discharged?

43:06.840 --> 43:09.354
Even better. Ace Gunner
promoted to Sergeant.

43:09.410 --> 43:11.708
First leave, then a
war bond tour.

43:11.760 --> 43:15.628
You hear that Bob?
Gene's a Sergeant!

43:15.680 --> 43:17.625
Sergeant.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.194
Come here Gene.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.935
Good work, son.

43:26.820 --> 43:28.469
Nice to see you mom.
