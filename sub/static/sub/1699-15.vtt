WEBVTT

00:09.708 --> 00:12.158
Chrissy... Now, you're
going to need to spend

00:12.159 --> 00:13.735
a few more hours
in the gym, sweetie

00:13.736 --> 00:14.971
to tighten that up.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.368
I need to use
your bathroom.

00:18.369 --> 00:20.364
Um, what's wrong
with the one downstairs?

00:20.365 --> 00:21.601
Dad just used that one.

00:21.602 --> 00:22.752
Say no more.

00:23.827 --> 00:26.167
Mom says if we hurry,
she'll drive us to school.

00:29.202 --> 00:31.100
Listen, what are you
doing Saturday?

00:33.317 --> 00:34.956
Corey, I just
had a vision

00:34.957 --> 00:37.565
that Mom wants to spend
some "quality time"

00:37.566 --> 00:38.697
with one of us this weekend.

00:38.698 --> 00:40.298
Quality time?

00:40.299 --> 00:42.065
I'm going over
to Jeremy's tomorrow.

00:42.066 --> 00:44.761
He just got his tonsils out and
we're feeding them to his snake.

00:47.062 --> 00:48.413
What are you doing?

00:48.414 --> 00:50.019
Well, nothing, but it's Friday.

00:50.020 --> 00:51.396
I can still get an offer.

00:51.397 --> 00:52.431
Where's Mom now?

00:52.432 --> 00:53.015
Waiting for us

00:53.016 --> 00:53.830
in the living room.

00:53.831 --> 00:54.856
I'm going
for the kitchen.

00:54.857 --> 00:56.427
Me, too. I can pee at school.

00:57.848 --> 01:00.698
Wait. Oh, get out of my way.

01:00.699 --> 01:01.796
I got to get my stuff.

01:01.797 --> 01:03.811
I got to get my backpack.

01:03.812 --> 01:04.968
Kids!

01:10.783 --> 01:12.084
Have you
seen Raven?

01:12.085 --> 01:13.936
Oh, you want Raven.

01:16.938 --> 01:18.038
She's right here.

01:21.865 --> 01:23.342
What are you
doing under there?

01:23.881 --> 01:28.079
Mama, can't a girl just chill
under her own kitchen table?

01:28.889 --> 01:30.757
Listen, what are
you doing Saturday?

01:30.758 --> 01:31.853
This Saturday?

01:32.341 --> 01:33.506
Now, if you already

01:33.507 --> 01:35.289
have plans, that's fine.

01:35.290 --> 01:37.672
It's not like I'm going
to guilt you into it

01:37.673 --> 01:42.500
by saying it has been so long
since we did anything together

01:42.501 --> 01:43.904
even though it has.

01:43.905 --> 01:45.603
So, how 'bout it?

01:45.604 --> 01:46.999
Got any plans?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.810
No, nothing, but...

01:48.811 --> 01:50.376
something probably.

01:52.108 --> 01:53.034
With you.

01:55.953 --> 01:58.357
And I wanted
to spend Saturday with you

01:58.843 --> 01:59.874
but I wouldn't want

01:59.875 --> 02:01.353
to disappoint Raven

02:01.938 --> 02:04.590
because that's
how much I love you.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.312 --> 02:59.763
Yep, that's me.

03:06.872 --> 03:09.566
I love my mom--
just not on Saturday.

03:09.567 --> 03:10.620
Freeze.

03:14.632 --> 03:15.999
Love that
you're psychic.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.851
Me, too. Soda does
not go with suede.

03:21.325 --> 03:22.268
So what's the big deal

03:22.269 --> 03:23.713
about hanging
with your mom tomorrow?

03:24.599 --> 03:25.790
You know what?
I guess

03:25.791 --> 03:27.982
there's nothing happening
this week anyway, so...

03:27.983 --> 03:29.201
Hey, Raven

03:29.202 --> 03:30.328
we're going
RollerBlading

03:30.329 --> 03:31.021
by the beach
Saturday.

03:31.022 --> 03:31.889
You want to come?

03:31.890 --> 03:33.009
Rae, I have
an extra ticket

03:33.010 --> 03:34.596
to the Alicia
Keys concert Saturday.

03:34.597 --> 03:35.912
I'm having a pool party
this Saturday.

03:35.913 --> 03:36.871
And we're going waterskiing.

03:36.872 --> 03:38.463
The concert's
totally sold out.

03:38.464 --> 03:40.374
It's a barbecue.
You like steak, or lobster?

03:40.375 --> 03:41.527
We can check out the lifeguards.

03:41.528 --> 03:43.526
Great seats, front row center.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.821
I'm inviting the whole class.

03:44.822 --> 03:46.183
Backstage passes.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.528
It's going
to be so cool.

03:47.529 --> 03:49.306
Karaoke.
So, can you come?

03:49.307 --> 03:50.290
You want to come? Are you coming?

03:50.291 --> 03:52.153
No!

03:54.872 --> 03:57.249
I mean, no thanks. I'm fine.

03:57.549 --> 04:00.781
She has to spend quality time
with her mother.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.426
Oh, that's too bad.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.255
So, what are you doing
this weekend, Eddie?

04:06.256 --> 04:08.122
Going to the movies
with a friend.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.254
We're going to see

04:09.255 --> 04:11.301
Ninja Vampires
from Outer Space.

04:11.302 --> 04:12.951
See, this vampire
comes to Earth

04:12.952 --> 04:14.274
'cause they done
sucked all the blood

04:14.275 --> 04:15.672
from his planet,
right?

04:26.072 --> 04:27.905
And the garlic don't work on these dudes

04:27.906 --> 04:28.851
because they're
from outer space

04:28.852 --> 04:30.297
and there is no garlic
in outer space

04:30.298 --> 04:31.881
that we know of.

04:34.677 --> 04:36.632
Wait a minute;
you know that guy?

04:37.343 --> 04:38.986
Oh, you mean Ricky?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.820
That's who I'm going
to the movies with.

04:40.821 --> 04:43.658
I have been trying to get
that guy to notice me all year.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.101
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

04:45.102 --> 04:47.499
What about this? I run
into you at the movies

04:47.500 --> 04:48.888
and act surprised;
you can be like

04:48.889 --> 04:50.517
"Yo, what's up, Rae?"
This is my homey

04:50.518 --> 04:52.574
Come join us." And
then you know, I'll...

04:56.905 --> 04:59.438
I'll look into his big,
brown, beautiful eyes

04:59.439 --> 05:00.969
and, and I'll say...

05:01.332 --> 05:03.498
Well, I won't know what
I'll say; I'll be too nervous

05:03.499 --> 05:05.908
but I will look good,
'cause... given.

05:05.909 --> 05:07.401
One problem.

05:07.402 --> 05:08.498
How are you going
to get out

05:08.499 --> 05:09.899
of doing something
with your mom?

05:19.496 --> 05:21.071
I just had the
best vision.

05:21.072 --> 05:22.577
Did it involve
me and Halle Berry?

05:23.155 --> 05:24.808
No, 'cause I
actually see things

05:24.809 --> 05:26.471
that are going
to happen.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.666
I just saw my mom
blowing her nose

05:28.667 --> 05:30.635
which obviously means that
she's going to get a cold

05:30.636 --> 05:32.395
which means my Saturday
just opened up--

05:32.396 --> 05:34.029
no quality time!

05:37.272 --> 05:39.691
I just feel bad that
she's going to get sick.

05:41.072 --> 05:42.518
You sure you're
not feeling sick?

05:42.519 --> 05:43.490
Not a tad bit stuffy?

05:43.491 --> 05:44.589
Here, blow for me,
Mother.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.952
No, stop.
Blow, blow, blow.

05:46.953 --> 05:47.730
Thank you.

05:47.731 --> 05:48.970
Listen, honey

05:48.971 --> 05:49.801
how about you?

05:49.802 --> 05:51.903
Are you all set
for our big day today?

05:51.904 --> 05:54.396
Uh, Mom, I hate to tell
you this, but, uh

05:55.147 --> 05:58.670
Mr. Petracelli just stuck me
with this research assignment

05:58.671 --> 06:01.121
which means I have to spend
all day in the library.

06:01.122 --> 06:02.970
Oh, well, honey,
it's okay.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.868
We'll have plenty of other times
we can get together.

06:04.869 --> 06:06.763
Next Saturday at 10:00 is good
for me, how about you?

06:06.764 --> 06:07.606
Great! It's a date.

06:07.607 --> 06:08.647
Thanks.

06:09.139 --> 06:09.890
Bye, Mom.

06:09.891 --> 06:13.281
The old library
research trick-- a classic.

06:13.282 --> 06:15.254
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:15.255 --> 06:17.281
Oh, you know,
I'm thinking you do.

06:17.282 --> 06:19.936
Oh, there's thinking
going on in here.

06:19.937 --> 06:21.749
Must be in the wrong house.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.844
You know what,
actually, Dad

06:24.647 --> 06:27.273
Corey was thinking
that, uh, you two

06:27.274 --> 06:30.476
need to spend some more
quality time together.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.142
He was hoping for
this... afternoon.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.571
Really?

06:34.572 --> 06:35.932
Oh, that would be great.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.219
Oh, great.

06:37.220 --> 06:38.190
Yeah.

06:38.472 --> 06:39.543
I'll just call one
of the chefs

06:39.544 --> 06:41.630
to cover for me
at the restaurant.

06:42.450 --> 06:43.930
Have a great
Saturday.

06:43.932 --> 06:45.292
Chubby cheeks.

06:56.894 --> 06:57.953
Eddie?

06:57.955 --> 06:59.032
Edward?

06:59.034 --> 07:00.746
Oh, my goodness, is that you?

07:00.749 --> 07:03.084
Oh, excuse me,
that is my friend.

07:03.086 --> 07:04.815
Excuse me.
Watch your tootsies.

07:04.817 --> 07:07.177
Coming through. Thank you much.

07:07.179 --> 07:08.552
Oh, thank you.

07:11.979 --> 07:16.678
And what a coincidence it is
to see you here at the movies

07:16.680 --> 07:18.878
my unattached friend, Raven.

07:20.372 --> 07:23.932
Whose phone number
I happen to know

07:24.515 --> 07:25.999
if anyone should want it.

07:26.965 --> 07:28.162
Hi, I'm Ricky.

07:28.164 --> 07:29.347
And I'm Raven.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.337
I'm so sorry.

07:31.372 --> 07:32.565
I'm so sorry.

07:32.567 --> 07:34.695
That's okay.
It's okay.

07:35.112 --> 07:36.517
That was my popcorn.

07:36.519 --> 07:38.392
Extra large, with butter.

07:38.394 --> 07:38.955
Eddie.

07:38.957 --> 07:39.860
Scat.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.843
All right.

07:41.845 --> 07:43.779
I'll be right back.
Okay.

07:44.194 --> 07:46.051
Shake it off, shake it off.

07:48.087 --> 07:49.912
Oh my goodness, I'm good.
I'm good.

07:49.914 --> 07:51.447
Oh! Goodness! Oh!

07:54.950 --> 07:57.117
I'm good! I'm good.

07:57.119 --> 07:58.037
Watch that step.

07:58.039 --> 07:59.097
Maintenance!

08:11.693 --> 08:13.458
I mean, hey, family.

08:22.142 --> 08:23.550
Rae, what are
you doing here?

08:23.551 --> 08:24.781
Yeah, big sister?

08:24.783 --> 08:27.368
I thought you were at
the library doing research.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.720
Well, you know...

08:30.472 --> 08:31.837
I was.

08:32.299 --> 08:37.467
But, you know, there's a really,
really good explanation

08:37.517 --> 08:38.818
you know, for all this.

08:38.869 --> 08:40.075
We're waiting.

08:40.511 --> 08:42.716
Okay, let me see,
um... well...

08:42.717 --> 08:46.018
She must have finished early,
gone home and seen my note.

08:46.020 --> 08:46.722
What note?

08:46.885 --> 08:48.386
Dad, the note.

08:48.388 --> 08:49.261
You didn't...

08:50.182 --> 08:51.665
Mama, you tell him,
'cause I...

08:51.666 --> 08:53.438
I left her a note
so she'd know where we were

08:53.440 --> 08:54.174
and wouldn't worry.

08:54.175 --> 08:57.890
Exactly, and I know where
you are and I'm not worried.

09:01.495 --> 09:02.661
You guys better go ahead.

09:02.663 --> 09:03.975
Your movie's about to start.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.837
Yeah, our movie's for babies.

09:05.839 --> 09:08.599
Honey, you're just not old
enough to see the other movies.

09:08.601 --> 09:11.066
But why do I have to see
Quest of the Bunny People?

09:11.068 --> 09:12.935
That's what
we're seeing?

09:12.937 --> 09:14.720
Any ninjas in that?

09:17.165 --> 09:19.151
I am so glad you came.

09:19.153 --> 09:20.665
We're going to see

09:20.667 --> 09:23.921
Farewell to Forever.

09:25.202 --> 09:26.745
But, but, Mom, I got...

09:26.747 --> 09:28.564
It's a tragic tale
about two lovers

09:28.565 --> 09:31.439
who are so close,
yet so far apart.

09:32.577 --> 09:34.125
I heard that.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.242
These look good.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.848
Oh, hey...

09:40.603 --> 09:42.274
hey, Mom, don't
you think you know

09:42.276 --> 09:44.055
it's just bit drafty
in here?

09:44.056 --> 09:45.894
That's not good
for your cold, right?

09:45.897 --> 09:48.172
How is it coming?
How is that?

09:48.174 --> 09:49.931
Stop it. I am fine.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.396
Hey, are you hungry?

09:51.398 --> 09:53.683
Hungry?
Yes, Mama, I am.

09:53.685 --> 09:55.631
So I need to go
to the candy counter.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.532
It could take a while,
long line, about an hour.

09:57.534 --> 09:58.290
See you.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.704
Honey, it's crazy
to pay those prices.

10:00.706 --> 10:05.811
Let's see, I've got popcorn,
chips, sandwiches...

10:05.813 --> 10:07.296
Do want tuna or chicken?

10:09.049 --> 10:11.734
You know, what I want, you
couldn't have in that bag.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.757
Try me.

10:15.846 --> 10:17.381
Chocolate-covered
raisins?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.463
$2.69 a pound.

10:20.376 --> 10:21.296
Great.

10:22.969 --> 10:24.664
Oh, Mom!

10:25.216 --> 10:28.329
I'm so sorry.
Mama, I'm so sorry.

10:28.331 --> 10:30.319
Oh, let me go
get you some more.

10:30.321 --> 10:31.794
Be right back.
My treat.

10:36.313 --> 10:38.245
You're not going
to like that seat.

10:38.641 --> 10:39.906
Okay.

10:52.707 --> 10:53.955
Excuse me.

10:53.957 --> 10:57.910
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

10:57.912 --> 11:00.146
Hey, where's Ricky?

11:00.312 --> 11:02.241
He went to go
get himself some popcorn.

11:02.243 --> 11:04.075
He asked if I wanted some,
but I said no

11:04.076 --> 11:06.025
because Raven's going to be
coming back with mine.

11:06.441 --> 11:10.479
So, I'll just wait...
and wait, and wait.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.220
I'm sorry.

11:12.222 --> 11:14.988
Um, see, I ran into
my whole family in the lobby

11:14.990 --> 11:15.886
and now I'm stuck

11:15.888 --> 11:17.287
watching this lame movie
with my mom.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.429
So when Ricky gets back
I want you to tell him...

11:19.431 --> 11:20.449
Tell me what?

11:23.949 --> 11:25.147
Tell...

11:25.875 --> 11:29.402
I wanted to tell you that
I forgot your popcorn.

11:29.404 --> 11:30.534
I'm sorry.

11:30.536 --> 11:32.040
That's okay, we can share mine.

11:32.042 --> 11:33.542
Oh, thank you.

11:33.544 --> 11:35.067
We're sharing.

11:36.450 --> 11:37.576
Hello.

11:37.612 --> 11:38.815
Your mom's
going to bust you

11:38.816 --> 11:40.312
if you don't get
your butt back there.

11:40.314 --> 11:41.750
Oh, I know.

11:52.348 --> 11:54.004
This is so romantic.

11:59.112 --> 12:00.384
Want a bite?

12:04.412 --> 12:07.851
Honey, sounds like
you're the one

12:07.853 --> 12:09.452
that's coming down
with a cold.

12:13.387 --> 12:15.216
We'll stop and get you
some throat lozenges

12:15.218 --> 12:16.478
on the way home.

12:17.548 --> 12:21.105
And maybe, maybe
some hand lotion, too.

12:25.669 --> 12:27.226
What's taking
Eddie so long?

12:27.228 --> 12:28.215
Who?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.543
Eddie.

12:30.346 --> 12:31.223
Right.

12:32.983 --> 12:33.933
Who?

12:34.914 --> 12:36.814
Never mind.
Candy?

12:39.548 --> 12:42.228
Rae, did you get
my chocolate covered raisins?

12:44.982 --> 12:45.858
Are you all right?

12:45.860 --> 12:47.386
Um, yes, I am.

12:47.388 --> 12:49.777
Actually, no, I'm not,
'cause, um...

12:49.779 --> 12:51.948
I don't like that candy.
Sorry.

12:51.950 --> 12:53.888
So I'm going
to get my own, right.

12:53.890 --> 12:54.694
Okay, I'll be right back.

13:02.612 --> 13:04.112
Aw...

13:14.204 --> 13:16.083
If I have to watch this,
so do you.

13:16.774 --> 13:17.845
Okay.

13:18.545 --> 13:20.175
What did I miss?

13:20.177 --> 13:22.194
Well, the Bunny People
are sad

13:22.196 --> 13:23.576
and Pitter-patter
the squirrel

13:23.578 --> 13:24.262
went out to get help

13:24.264 --> 13:25.823
in the Land
of Happy Rainbows.

13:25.825 --> 13:27.315
But don't worry

13:27.317 --> 13:30.174
there's still
an hour and a half left.

13:35.895 --> 13:37.644
Oh, this line is way too long.

13:45.131 --> 13:46.414
Hey, girl.

13:46.416 --> 13:48.127
Hey... Becky,
I just started today.

13:48.129 --> 13:48.902
Let me help you out.

13:48.904 --> 13:49.751
Hey, sir, what you want?

13:49.753 --> 13:50.727
Some chocolate-covered raisins?

13:50.730 --> 13:52.470
Great choice.
I like them, too.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.110
Okay, whoa.

13:55.112 --> 13:56.792
No, you stay, I'm going
to go to the back

13:56.794 --> 13:58.330
get some more containers
'cause we're totally out.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.029
This guys
wants popcorn.

14:00.031 --> 14:01.261
Extra butter,
okay?

14:02.118 --> 14:03.083
Thanks, Becky.

14:04.296 --> 14:05.706
Becky's going on
a little break.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.133
I'm going to get you
some popcorn, sir.

14:09.201 --> 14:11.511
Here we go,
getting some popcorn.

14:11.513 --> 14:12.830
Butter.

14:15.636 --> 14:16.965
Come on, let's go.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.014
There we go. Butter.

14:20.146 --> 14:21.563
All right, here you go, sir.

14:24.942 --> 14:26.763
Everything's
under control, people.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.083
Can I get the...
can I, can I...

14:33.085 --> 14:35.516
Let me just...

14:35.518 --> 14:37.662
There you go.

14:39.007 --> 14:40.204
Calm down, people.

14:40.206 --> 14:42.140
Here's your licorice.
Get your licorice.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.104
Take this.

14:44.105 --> 14:45.693
I don't have no time
to wrestle with this.

14:49.269 --> 14:50.271
Nachos!

14:50.706 --> 14:51.930
Nachos?

14:51.932 --> 14:54.180
Here, take the nachos, people.

14:54.182 --> 14:55.396
Take the nachos.

14:57.584 --> 14:58.831
Take the nachos.

15:00.412 --> 15:01.997
I'm so sorry. I love you.

15:02.907 --> 15:04.840
Oh, yeah.

15:04.843 --> 15:05.989
Look at that right there.

15:05.991 --> 15:07.338
See, that's brains.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.977
Hey, Becky.

15:10.012 --> 15:11.368
How you doing, girl?

15:11.369 --> 15:12.623
Back so soon?

15:16.388 --> 15:18.123
Who ordered
the boot with butter?

15:24.212 --> 15:26.426
It was, it was nice
working with you, Becky.

15:28.409 --> 15:30.294
Let me butter
your popcorn for you.

15:41.136 --> 15:44.129
Um, here, let me
get this from you, Becky.

15:46.186 --> 15:47.372
Thanks, Becky.

15:52.165 --> 15:55.411
Okay, clouds are not
made out of cotton candy

15:55.447 --> 15:56.652
bunnies do not talk

15:56.654 --> 15:59.043
and trees do not
hug you when you're sad.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.630
These are lies we shouldn't
be teaching to our children.

16:01.631 --> 16:02.956
You think your mom
will buy it?

16:02.958 --> 16:03.674
No.

16:03.677 --> 16:06.612
And a real ninja
wouldn't care.

16:06.614 --> 16:07.907
We're going in.

16:12.191 --> 16:15.448
Ew, his brains are oozing out
through his eye socket.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.288
Let's get a seat up close.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.717
Give this to my mom.

16:32.719 --> 16:34.976
Your candy, your mom,
and your jacket.

16:34.978 --> 16:36.391
I'm going back
to my movie.

16:36.394 --> 16:37.577
Oh, please, Eddie.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.306
It's stuck, wait...

16:40.808 --> 16:43.668
Rae, did you get my
chocolate covered raisins?

16:45.806 --> 16:47.966
Yes, Mom. Coming.

16:56.290 --> 16:57.503
Coming, Mom.

17:07.182 --> 17:09.912
Hey, you can have
your raisins, Mom.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.378
I'll give them
to you right now.

17:12.381 --> 17:14.846
No, no, not left now.

17:14.848 --> 17:17.454
Right now.

17:17.455 --> 17:19.721
Uh, there you go, Mommy.

17:19.723 --> 17:21.143
Thank you.

17:21.752 --> 17:23.021
But dearest

17:23.025 --> 17:26.150
you and little Rodney
are all I have.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.140
This movie is so sad.

17:29.277 --> 17:31.149
I love it.

17:31.181 --> 17:32.520
You want a tissue?

17:32.522 --> 17:33.438
Uh, no thanks.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.829
Okay, then maybe I will.

17:34.832 --> 17:37.279
I'll just use it to wipe
my nose, not my ear.

17:37.281 --> 17:39.968
Wait, ear to the left...
above my chin...

17:40.017 --> 17:42.609
Oh, there's my nose, right...

17:44.474 --> 17:48.028
Oh, yeah, that was good.
That was good.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.140
Thank you.

17:49.142 --> 17:53.070
Now I'm just going to stop...
I'm just going...

17:53.071 --> 17:54.836
I'm going to stop now.

17:56.291 --> 17:57.908
Ew, that's nasty.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.411
Let me just flick it
right over there.

18:03.781 --> 18:06.495
Um, hey, Mom, you got
something to drink?

18:06.497 --> 18:09.103
Oh, sure, you want

18:09.564 --> 18:11.478
water or lemonade?

18:11.480 --> 18:14.513
Um, surprise me.

18:26.746 --> 18:28.584
Okay, I don't think
she saw us.

18:28.586 --> 18:29.779
So when you go back in there

18:29.782 --> 18:31.723
I want you to go in there,
just sit down, be quiet...

18:31.724 --> 18:33.641
Rae, I told you,
I'm not doing it anymore.

18:33.643 --> 18:35.259
Eddie, I just want
to go in there

18:35.261 --> 18:37.031
and say good-bye to Ricky
and then I'll be right back.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.323
She is so into that movie

18:38.325 --> 18:40.107
it doesn't matter who's
next to her, I'm telling you.

18:40.109 --> 18:41.309
Oh, yeah?

18:41.311 --> 18:42.843
Is that why she
leaned over three times

18:42.845 --> 18:45.215
to let you know how glad
she was that you were there?

18:47.682 --> 18:48.678
She said that?

18:48.680 --> 18:49.764
Yes.

18:50.322 --> 18:53.650
And if you were sitting with her
you would have heard it.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.663
By the way, your mom's buying me
bras and underwear Thursday.

19:18.066 --> 19:20.011
Sorry, Mom, bathroom break.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.016
Wait, wait,
wait a second.

19:29.018 --> 19:30.078
What's going on?

19:30.080 --> 19:31.781
Honey, the movie's over.

19:31.783 --> 19:34.139
No. I mean, I just...

19:35.974 --> 19:37.620
I- I don't want it to be over.

19:37.621 --> 19:39.180
Oh, me neither,
honey.

19:39.182 --> 19:41.382
But there'll be other movies.
Other Saturdays.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.275
I was just getting
into this one.

19:47.079 --> 19:49.809
Mom, you blew your nose,
like in my vision

19:50.242 --> 19:52.282
but you're not doing it
because you have a cold.

19:53.202 --> 19:55.961
You're doing it because
you were crying at the movie.

19:55.964 --> 19:59.162
Well, it's the movie
and it's you and it's me

19:59.164 --> 20:00.802
and it's our time together.

20:01.317 --> 20:03.555
Right, our time.

20:04.148 --> 20:06.310
Honey, I love you.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.081
Wasn't this fun?

20:12.083 --> 20:12.710
Yeah.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.757
What happened
to your hands?

20:13.759 --> 20:14.856
They were so rough.

20:14.858 --> 20:15.892
What'd you put on them?

20:15.894 --> 20:17.759
Uh... butter.

20:23.192 --> 20:24.802
Hey, baby, look.

20:24.804 --> 20:25.777
I know what you're thinking.

20:25.779 --> 20:27.558
We tried to make it
through the Bunny People

20:28.124 --> 20:30.731
but... clouds are not
made out of cotton candy and...

20:30.733 --> 20:33.497
Bunnies do not suck
other bunnies' blood.

20:34.436 --> 20:36.662
Exactly.
That would be so cool.

20:36.664 --> 20:39.053
Yeah, the little sharp teeth
and the little furry necks.

20:39.055 --> 20:40.375
Yeah!

20:41.400 --> 20:42.900
Yeah, we'll be outside.

20:45.976 --> 20:48.048
Raven, Mrs. Baxter.

20:48.050 --> 20:50.246
What a lovely surprise
it is to see you here today.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.307
I'm here with
my friend Ricky.

20:51.309 --> 20:52.595
We were going
to grab a bite to eat.

20:52.597 --> 20:53.816
You want to come?

20:55.014 --> 20:56.456
Honey, you should go.

20:57.288 --> 20:58.576
He is fine.

21:00.554 --> 21:01.841
Okay.

21:09.876 --> 21:11.110
You know what, Ricky?

21:12.342 --> 21:13.959
I think I'm going
to hang out with my mom.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.877
Okay.

21:15.879 --> 21:17.289
Then I guess I'll
just see you at school.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.135
Okay.

21:20.585 --> 21:21.566
Yo, Rae.

21:22.159 --> 21:23.246
Good for you.

21:25.713 --> 21:27.653
Honey, you didn't
have to do that.

21:27.655 --> 21:28.872
I know, but...

21:28.874 --> 21:30.904
I really wanted to see
the movie with you.

21:30.906 --> 21:31.924
Again.

21:31.926 --> 21:33.295
Really?

21:33.297 --> 21:34.204
Really.

21:34.207 --> 21:35.772
But we just saw it.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.225
Yeah, well, I guess I just
need some more quality time.

21:53.492 --> 21:55.949
Someday, we'll be together again.

21:56.595 --> 22:02.214
Until that time,
farewell to forever.

22:07.272 --> 22:10.419
I just wish somebody'd get
beaten up in this thing.
