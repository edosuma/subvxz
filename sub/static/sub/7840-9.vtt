01:08.785 --> 01:11.810
Laugh it up with Christ and Krusty

01:11.811 --> 01:13.134
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

01:13.135 --> 01:14.760
ha, ha, ha, ha

01:14.761 --> 01:17.803
We got hired 'cause we are busty

01:17.804 --> 01:19.173
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

01:19.174 --> 01:20.773
ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.046
Hey! Hey!

01:26.855 --> 01:28.849
Oh... whoa... whoa!

01:30.606 --> 01:31.540
Real nice

01:31.544 --> 01:34.141
laughing at an old man's pain.

01:34.143 --> 01:37.318
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:41.131 --> 01:42.429
We've got a great show tonight,

01:42.489 --> 01:43.413
with all your favorite

01:43.416 --> 01:45.342
second-tier costume characters.

01:45.415 --> 01:47.402
Like Ribwich Rib-it!

01:49.197 --> 01:50.713
Matrix Poochie!

01:51.787 --> 01:53.590
And right off the plane

01:53.595 --> 01:55.621
from his dad's funeral,

01:55.625 --> 01:57.352
Sideshow Mel!

01:59.677 --> 02:01.502
And now for the highlight of our show,

02:01.575 --> 02:04.800
a special appearance by Elvis....

02:05.018 --> 02:06.232
...Stojko!

02:07.945 --> 02:11.622
Olympic Medalist Elvis Stojko performs a graceful triple axel.

02:11.668 --> 02:14.383
Elvis Stojko is so handsome.

02:14.396 --> 02:16.461
He can lace up my skates any time.

02:16.468 --> 02:17.612
Don't you hags know

02:17.627 --> 02:18.993
that all male figure skaters

02:18.998 --> 02:20.953
are "twinkly in the lutz"?

02:20.955 --> 02:22.540
That's a common misconception.

02:22.557 --> 02:24.900
I have a girlfriend in Vancouver.

02:24.955 --> 02:26.841
Made-up girlfriend, made-up city.

02:35.586 --> 02:36.912
Just think, Lisa,

02:36.917 --> 02:39.163
if I had paid for those skating lessons,

02:39.165 --> 02:40.543
that could've been you.

02:42.688 --> 02:44.073
Say, Mel,

02:44.078 --> 02:46.032
those figure skaters sure are having

02:46.038 --> 02:48.111
a swell time out there.

02:48.118 --> 02:51.923
Indeed!
Why don't we join them?

02:53.236 --> 02:54.153
Oh, my back.

03:00.825 --> 03:03.981
Wow, Krusty and Mel sure can skate.

03:03.986 --> 03:06.242
Nothin' slows down the baby boomers.

03:11.986 --> 03:13.640
Aw, don't look so shocked.

03:13.647 --> 03:14.831
You knew the deal.

03:18.808 --> 03:21.322
Children, we need your help.

03:21.328 --> 03:23.603
The Grumple has stolen

03:23.606 --> 03:25.881
all of our Holiday Cheer.

03:25.895 --> 03:27.541
That can't be good.

03:27.706 --> 03:29.323
Grumply, grumply groo,

03:29.338 --> 03:31.481
I'll throw my net over you.

03:31.608 --> 03:32.092
Look out!

03:32.098 --> 03:33.293
It's the Grumple!

03:38.086 --> 03:39.262
Oh!

03:39.325 --> 03:41.173
Whoa, watch where you're going there, pally.

03:41.175 --> 03:42.781
We've got a basketball game in an hour.

03:44.348 --> 03:47.200
But we're trying to get to Mistletoe Mountain.

03:47.207 --> 03:49.210
Tell it to the Utah Jazz, snowflake.

03:51.637 --> 03:52.743
Elvis, Grumple,

03:52.747 --> 03:53.762
Candy Kevin!

03:53.765 --> 03:55.402
Let's teach these guys

03:55.406 --> 03:57.292
the real meaning of Christmas.

04:08.588 --> 04:09.553
Come on, Homer.

04:09.558 --> 04:11.171
Let's get the kids out of here.

04:11.765 --> 04:12.443
Homer?

04:12.447 --> 04:15.383
Give back that Holiday Cheer, you bastard!

04:15.388 --> 04:16.012
Never!

04:18.887 --> 04:20.452
This sweater is gorgeous.

04:20.466 --> 04:22.303
I'll take onein "wife" size

04:22.307 --> 04:24.020
and three in"mistress" size.

04:27.507 --> 04:29.773
Now Smithers,I need your advice

04:29.955 --> 04:32.340
picking out a gift for a very dear friend of mine.

04:32.345 --> 04:34.390
A single fellow,a bit quiet,

04:34.766 --> 04:36.983
but one with a warm,loyal heart.

04:37.066 --> 04:38.720
Well, sir, a fellow like that

04:38.967 --> 04:41.461
might have had his eye on this silver frame.

04:41.466 --> 04:44.482
It would go great with his collection of Art Deco...

04:44.485 --> 04:46.350
Shut up, shut up!There he is.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.590
Hello, Phillip.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.381
What are you doing here?

04:50.146 --> 04:53.613
Oh-ho. Never you mind, Mr. Nosey.

04:54.696 --> 04:56.921
Are you going to that string quartet thing?

04:56.935 --> 04:57.940
'Cause I'm not.

04:59.926 --> 05:00.733
Are you still here?

05:00.925 --> 05:01.660
Go pay for that.

05:06.077 --> 05:06.691
Well, uh...

05:06.696 --> 05:09.841
what can ol' Santa bring you for Christmas, son?

05:09.845 --> 05:11.251
I want a dirt bike,

05:11.256 --> 05:13.521
one of those video gamechairs that vibrate...

05:13.525 --> 05:16.551
Dad, he's not the real Santa.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.282
We can't afford that stuff.

05:18.435 --> 05:21.421
Shut up.Shut up. Shut up!

05:22.538 --> 05:24.082
I better go after him.

05:26.737 --> 05:28.673
What can I do for you,young lady?

05:29.296 --> 05:32.492
What I want can't be bought at any store.

05:32.527 --> 05:34.280
Oh, what is it, sweetie?

05:34.285 --> 05:35.480
Peace on earth?

05:35.495 --> 05:36.672
What? No!

05:36.805 --> 05:38.363
I-I mean,that's a given.

05:38.546 --> 05:42.063
But also, the Malibu Stacy Pony Beach Party Set

05:42.068 --> 05:43.430
with Sparkle Sand.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.693
It's sold out everywhere.

05:52.657 --> 05:53.292
You know,

05:53.296 --> 05:56.111
Santa thinks he saw an extra Beach Party Set

05:56.117 --> 05:58.212
sitting back in the stockroom there.

05:59.038 --> 05:59.802
Really?

05:59.807 --> 06:01.111
Y-you just wait here.

06:01.115 --> 06:02.622
Let me go check,Sugar plum.

06:09.337 --> 06:12.111
Oh, thank you,thank you, thank you!

06:12.445 --> 06:14.982
You really made my daughter's Christmas.

06:15.557 --> 06:17.862
Well, her smile made mine.

06:19.755 --> 06:20.530
Gil!

06:20.787 --> 06:23.490
March your fake bootfronts over here!

06:24.366 --> 06:25.842
Mr. Costington!

06:26.076 --> 06:28.121
Sir, I'm glad I have this chance to talk to you.

06:28.127 --> 06:29.790
I've been on the payroll here since May,

06:29.795 --> 06:30.520
and I'd really like

06:30.525 --> 06:32.102
to start working in Ladies Shoes.

06:32.105 --> 06:33.373
Not literally, of course.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.123
I... I couldn't walk very fast,

06:35.127 --> 06:36.633
though I'd learn if that's what it takes.

06:36.637 --> 06:37.941
Never mind that now!

06:38.036 --> 06:41.043
Did you sell the Malibu Stacy set I put aside?

06:42.316 --> 06:43.673
That was for you?

06:43.776 --> 06:45.841
It was for my daughter!

06:45.938 --> 06:49.482
You nitwit!

06:49.727 --> 06:51.820
I want my dolly!

06:51.965 --> 06:54.353
You nitwit!

06:54.475 --> 06:57.251
Now get back that toy.

06:58.707 --> 07:00.533
Gee, I'm sorry, sir.

07:00.577 --> 07:02.441
Taking back that doll would break

07:02.445 --> 07:05.062
a little girl's heart on Christmas Eve.

07:05.065 --> 07:09.293
I made a lot of mistakes in mylife, but I would never do that.

07:09.575 --> 07:11.523
Well, then, you're...

07:11.615 --> 07:12.963
fired!

07:13.145 --> 07:13.860
But I...

07:15.148 --> 07:15.680
Aw.

07:20.238 --> 07:22.333
Oh, you poor man.

07:22.435 --> 07:25.091
Fired on Christmas Eve.

07:25.726 --> 07:27.941
Why don't you have dinner with us tonight?

07:28.135 --> 07:29.352
Please, Santa?

07:29.358 --> 07:31.883
Well, let me check the bus schedule here.

07:31.898 --> 07:34.641
If I get it...make a transfer there.

07:34.645 --> 07:36.600
Well, I could be there by 2:00 a.m.

07:36.704 --> 07:38.081
We'll give you a ride.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.171
That's swell.

07:39.171 --> 07:41.259
Could you swing by my ex-wife's place?

07:41.259 --> 07:44.101
I want her to see me riding in a car.

07:44.448 --> 07:47.701
And a partridge in a...

07:52.287 --> 07:54.092
...pear tree.

07:59.635 --> 08:00.541
Oh, yeah.

08:00.937 --> 08:03.512
Well, I guess ol' Gil should skedaddle.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.222
You can't go home tonight.

08:05.228 --> 08:06.871
It's cold.It's late.

08:07.037 --> 08:09.872
Yeah, maybe I should spend the night here, too.

08:09.876 --> 08:11.710
You're getting a cab, old man.

08:11.717 --> 08:13.510
In fact, I believe I see it now.

08:13.645 --> 08:15.871
But I haven't given you a present.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.941
Your present is leaving.

08:17.947 --> 08:19.932
Oh, I don't see a cab.

08:20.897 --> 08:24.351
Well, since I'staying,how about another song?

08:24.367 --> 08:27.572
Jazzin' around the Christmas tree

08:27.577 --> 08:30.301
It's a skit skat holiday.

08:31.105 --> 08:31.883
It's Christmas!

08:31.888 --> 08:33.933
It's Christmas! It's Christmas!

08:33.934 --> 08:36.182
I didn't think it would ever come, but it did!

08:39.876 --> 08:41.701
What is all this?

08:41.775 --> 08:44.230
Well, I figured since you invited me to stay,

08:44.246 --> 08:47.480
I might as well go down to the bus locker
and get my stuff.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.393
Oh.

08:48.748 --> 08:51.431
Marge, we have a problem here.

08:51.808 --> 08:54.510
You have a bigger problem out there.

08:54.755 --> 08:58.971
Grumply, grumply groo,your blood will make my stew.

08:59.485 --> 09:02.012
Do you think that's the same Grumple

09:02.017 --> 09:03.481
from the ice show?

09:03.996 --> 09:05.510
Because I do.

09:07.727 --> 09:10.971
Hey Hey, who wants some eggs a la Harold Stassen?

09:10.975 --> 09:11.421
Huh?

09:14.157 --> 09:15.913
They're always running!

09:19.178 --> 09:21.620
Do you really understand what that means?

09:22.836 --> 09:23.381
Kinda.

09:24.088 --> 09:26.322
Why did you let that loser into our home?

09:26.335 --> 09:29.040
I'll tell you why:Christian charity.

09:29.055 --> 09:30.230
Christian Charity?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.252
What does a porn star have to do with this?

09:32.256 --> 09:33.393
He's gotta go.

09:33.396 --> 09:35.962
I promise you he'll leave after today.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.361
Really?
Who's gonna make him?

09:37.448 --> 09:38.410
I will.

09:45.595 --> 09:47.931
He sure has a lot of markers that don't work.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.023
Well, I got something.

09:50.028 --> 09:51.532
Gah! A spider bite,

09:51.535 --> 09:54.060
or as I like to call it,a "Christmas kiss."

09:54.075 --> 09:56.181
Listen, uh, Gil...

09:56.586 --> 09:58.400
I sort of thought that...

09:59.288 --> 10:02.163
you know, you'd be on your way by now.

10:02.266 --> 10:03.083
Really?

10:03.085 --> 10:06.082
You're gonna put me out on Christmas day, huh?

10:08.485 --> 10:09.523
Well, that's all right.

10:09.528 --> 10:11.301
I can go down to the men's shelter.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.511
I just hope that weird priest with the runny eye

10:13.518 --> 10:15.521
ain't serving soup,'cause they...

10:15.528 --> 10:18.153
Wait, you don't have a place to live?

10:18.237 --> 10:19.932
Lower the boom.

10:21.386 --> 10:24.921
I guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over.

10:27.196 --> 10:29.551
Has the boom been lowered?

10:29.675 --> 10:30.522
No!

10:31.897 --> 10:34.062
D'oh...

10:35.205 --> 10:37.442
Appearing in their
first Rose Parade,

10:37.498 --> 10:39.672
the marching band
from Altoona, Pennsylvania

10:39.776 --> 10:42.800
playing "Rachel's Theme"
from Batman Begins.

10:43.008 --> 10:46.190
Hey-ya, Marge,Happy New Year.
You make any resolutions?

10:46.457 --> 10:48.753
Yes. One... involving you.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.053
What a coincidence!
I made one, too.

10:51.355 --> 10:53.753
I'm gonna move my fanny
off this sofa.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.101
And move it over to
thatrecliner by the phone

10:57.156 --> 11:01.151
'cause I'm expecting a call any minute
now from my old boss at Jackpot Realty,

11:01.155 --> 11:03.742
asking me take over
the Scottsdale office.

11:03.845 --> 11:04.843
Really?

11:04.886 --> 11:08.142
Oh, yeah. That desert air's
gonna give the ol' one-two

11:08.146 --> 11:09.401
to my bronchitis.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.532
Oh... boy.

11:17.537 --> 11:19.853
I guess you can stay
a little longer.

11:20.158 --> 11:21.550
Ah, thank you, Marge.

11:23.257 --> 11:25.002
You know, those floats
should really slow down

11:25.057 --> 11:28.702
and savor it, 'cause your
lifecan go to Hell pretty quick.

11:36.508 --> 11:39.673
We're not keeping that moocher
in this house another minute.

11:41.008 --> 11:43.781
He's still in need.
We have to let him stay.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.182
It's what Dr. Kingwo to do.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.003
Oh, that's it.
We're changing doctors.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.282
Please,
just a few more days.

11:50.686 --> 11:51.982
Marge, admit it.

11:51.985 --> 11:52.982
You just can't say
"no" to anyone.

11:52.987 --> 11:56.331
That's why you have three kids.

11:56.436 --> 11:59.883
It's true.
I do have trouble saying "no."

12:00.085 --> 12:01.921
It all started when I was seven.

12:03.306 --> 12:03.971
Marjorie,

12:04.008 --> 12:06.331
we need you to hide our
cigarettes in your dollhouse.

12:06.635 --> 12:07.632
No!

12:11.837 --> 12:12.601
Mom?

12:12.807 --> 12:13.822
Gramma?

12:13.927 --> 12:14.921
Aunt Larina?

12:15.306 --> 12:16.223
Anybody?

12:21.008 --> 12:25.102
And that's why I have trouble
saying "no" to people.

12:25.105 --> 12:26.403
Even Gil.

12:26.607 --> 12:31.022
Marge, I have no idea
what you were just thinking about.

12:31.127 --> 12:32.943
Why would you think I did?

12:40.457 --> 12:41.622
What's a matter, Homer?

12:41.727 --> 12:43.023
You still miss the UPN?

12:43.126 --> 12:45.003
Yeah, but there's
something else.

12:45.006 --> 12:47.053
There's this loser staying
in our house.

12:47.056 --> 12:49.740
Marge says she's gonna kick him out,
but then she never does.

12:49.946 --> 12:51.143
Well, you can't kick him out,

12:51.145 --> 12:53.600
'cause then Marge will never
learn to assert herself.

12:53.705 --> 12:56.252
Well, I guess I'll have
to wait for Marge

12:56.257 --> 12:58.931
to show some backbone and
You again?!

13:05.246 --> 13:07.783
What the hell is this thing?

13:08.907 --> 13:11.381
<i>Happy holidays</i>

13:12.255 --> 13:17.980
<i>May the calendar keep
bringing happy holidays </i>

13:18.887 --> 13:20.220
Homie.

13:20.525 --> 13:21.722
Wake up.

13:22.126 --> 13:24.702
I rented that negligee you like.

13:26.796 --> 13:29.140
Those legs go on forever.

13:29.747 --> 13:31.400
Oh, wait, they stop right there.

13:40.388 --> 13:43.341
Homer, don't forget
it's Valentine's Day!

13:43.745 --> 13:44.850
What you gettin' the missus?

13:45.156 --> 13:48.370
A heart-shaped box of chocolates.

13:50.008 --> 13:51.092
Gil, listen.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.551
We've been very patient,
but I want you to...

13:56.508 --> 13:57.602
Is that for me?

13:57.708 --> 13:59.593
Is it the Scottsdale job?

13:59.798 --> 14:01.871
It's your foot doctor, Gil!

14:02.278 --> 14:03.071
Yes.

14:03.478 --> 14:04.471
Yes.

14:04.676 --> 14:05.671
Oh, dear.

14:06.678 --> 14:08.501
I can't tell him that!

14:08.808 --> 14:12.662
Aw, geez!
Boy, I was...

14:14.305 --> 14:15.663
Well, I'm still a winner!

14:15.765 --> 14:17.401
As long as I got a cup of coffee

14:17.508 --> 14:20.502
and a tomorrow on the calendar,
ol' Gil's comin' back.

14:20.806 --> 14:23.850
Oh. Say, Homer, how about
closin' up that robe?

14:23.955 --> 14:25.601
I'm seeing the whole butcher shop.

14:26.646 --> 14:28.002
For your information,

14:28.057 --> 14:30.822
since I bought it,
I put on a ton of weight.

14:33.525 --> 14:35.883
<i>Happy holidays</i>

14:37.106 --> 14:42.452
<i>May the calendar keep bringing
happy holidays... </i>

14:42.555 --> 14:44.723
<i>McCarthy pumps the old bassoon </i>

14:44.786 --> 14:46.302
<i>While I the pipes do play</i>

14:46.405 --> 14:49.531
<i>And Hennessy Tennessee
tootles the flute </i>

14:49.636 --> 14:50.950
And the music isawfully grand...

14:51.036 --> 14:54.850
Oh, their drunken singing
is ruining St. Patrick's Day!

14:55.106 --> 14:58.103
Well, just let 'em
finish this one song.

14:58.287 --> 15:01.352
<i>There's O'Brians, O'Ryans,
O'Sheehans and Meehans</i>

15:01.408 --> 15:03.320
<i>They come from Ireland...</i>

15:17.076 --> 15:19.170
<i>Happy Holidays</i>

15:19.375 --> 15:21.582
<i>Happy Holidays...</i>

15:21.986 --> 15:24.542

15:24.545 --> 15:26.620

<i>Happy Holidays</i>

15:29.565 --> 15:31.401

15:32.205 --> 15:37.170
May the calendar keep bringing
happy holidays to you.

15:40.005 --> 15:40.801
Oh, man.

15:40.808 --> 15:42.550
Now he even mooches
our lunches.

15:44.438 --> 15:47.262
All he left me with are
these used nicotine patches.

15:47.565 --> 15:49.100
Give me your lunch,
dingus.

15:51.205 --> 15:53.271
Oh, mini quesadillas!

15:55.408 --> 15:56.203
Zesty!

16:01.236 --> 16:08.021
<i>Happy Holidays
May the calendar keep bringing</i>

16:08.528 --> 16:13.830
<i>happy holidays to you. </i>

16:16.006 --> 16:17.733
Im so sick of Gil.

16:17.936 --> 16:21.990
He ruins Thanksgiving,
uses my leg razor to peel his carrots...

16:22.057 --> 16:24.600
Marge, I hate to
interrupt the ol'solilo-diddly-iloquy,

16:24.606 --> 16:27.271
but I just want to thank you
for your early Christmas card.

16:27.578 --> 16:28.602
Christmas card?

16:28.608 --> 16:30.531
I haven't even taken
the photo yet.

16:30.535 --> 16:32.590
Isn't this your posse on this glossy?

16:36.307 --> 16:38.262
That Photoshopping freak!

16:38.367 --> 16:41.240
Oh, I don't mean to cause
Gil ill will, but still...

16:41.246 --> 16:43.041
Don't you defend him!

16:43.136 --> 16:45.660
I want that mooch out
of my house right now!

16:45.768 --> 16:48.242
Marge, I've never seen
you like this before.

16:48.248 --> 16:49.240
That's right!

16:49.347 --> 16:52.292
I just found my gumption,
and I like it!

16:52.395 --> 16:55.841
Marge Simpson is gonna say no!

16:55.906 --> 16:57.492
Gil! Gil?

16:57.608 --> 16:58.402
Gil!

16:58.508 --> 16:59.901
Gil's gone.

17:00.007 --> 17:01.052
Back to Scottsdale.

17:01.106 --> 17:02.660
- Problem solved.
- End of story.

17:02.707 --> 17:03.931
Can we have pancakes
for dinner?

17:04.708 --> 17:05.500
Gil's gone?

17:05.507 --> 17:08.421
But I have a "no" inside met
hat has to come out.

17:08.525 --> 17:10.490
Hey, Marge,
you want a thousand dollars?

17:10.597 --> 17:11.782
No!

17:11.818 --> 17:12.790
I mean, yes!

17:12.797 --> 17:13.692
Too late.

17:15.278 --> 17:19.672
Don't worry. I make
six of those a year.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.300
Even though Gil left,
I still have to kick him out.

17:24.507 --> 17:27.452
I need this, or I'll never
be able to say "no."

17:27.656 --> 17:29.833
Mom, I understand
your psychological need,

17:29.906 --> 17:31.400
but I'm not sure what you can do.

17:31.498 --> 17:32.700
I'll tell you what.

17:32.707 --> 17:35.803
- We're going to Scottsdale!
- Scottsdale?

17:35.857 --> 17:37.443
Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.332
- Sure.
- Then forget it!

17:48.907 --> 17:51.250
I'll ask these active
seniors if they know Gil.

17:51.306 --> 17:53.273
I'll have you know I'm 32.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.882
There he is!

18:00.607 --> 18:01.273
Gunderson?!

18:09.155 --> 18:11.403
Whoa, Gil's a big shot!

18:11.455 --> 18:14.001
And to think he and I once
shared a shower.

18:14.058 --> 18:16.483
I don't care
how successful Gil is.

18:16.548 --> 18:19.053
He's still a mooch,
and I need to tell him off!

18:27.007 --> 18:28.522
117 degrees?

18:28.525 --> 18:29.981
Ooh, that reminds me.

18:31.426 --> 18:34.903
There's water under the seat!

18:38.608 --> 18:39.682
Now remember, Marge,

18:39.736 --> 18:42.772
we're not buying anything
for more than 1.2,

18:43.047 --> 18:48.440
but if I scratch my nose,
that means we can go to 1.5.

18:51.835 --> 18:54.000
People, remember,
you're selling dreams!

18:54.208 --> 18:55.300
When a family owns a home,

18:58.227 --> 19:00.853
And what matters most
isn't the commission you make,

19:00.907 --> 19:03.293
it's the smiles on their faces

19:03.336 --> 19:06.402
when they know they own
that land free and clear.

19:06.555 --> 19:07.863
He's the best I've ever seen.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.803
He's talking at a Century 22 level.

19:12.405 --> 19:14.002
Gil, remember me?

19:14.107 --> 19:16.440
Marge Simpson?
What are you doing here?

19:16.646 --> 19:18.671
Lookin' for a home
on a quiet cul-de-sac,

19:18.676 --> 19:20.873
where your neighbor
could be Tanya Tucker?

19:22.507 --> 19:23.371
Listen, bub.

19:23.377 --> 19:26.500
I have something to say to you,
and it can't wait.

19:26.665 --> 19:30.553
Oh, well, looks like we got
a Backout Bettyon our hands.

19:30.595 --> 19:33.341
But watch ol' Gil take her
from furious to curious.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.452
Now, ma'am, you say
you can't wait, and you're right.

19:35.527 --> 19:37.920
With interest rates climbing
and choice properties

19:37.928 --> 19:40.153
in the Kingsbridge School
District drying up...

19:41.477 --> 19:43.831
The only house I'm
interested in is my own,

19:43.836 --> 19:47.242
which you defiled
for 11 hellish months.

19:47.298 --> 19:49.722
But now I've
learned to say "no!"

19:49.797 --> 19:52.501
No to your mooching!
No to your manipulation!

19:52.808 --> 19:55.983
And a big fat no to the
Kingsbridge School District!

19:57.118 --> 20:00.071
Aw, come on, you can't
say no to ol' Gil.

20:00.477 --> 20:01.600
No!

20:03.787 --> 20:05.203
Why, he's as pathetic as we are.

20:09.106 --> 20:09.951
Gunderson!

20:09.956 --> 20:11.640
I put you in charge
of this office

20:11.647 --> 20:13.402
because I thought
you could tame this town.

20:13.807 --> 20:16.601
You're fired!

20:23.646 --> 20:25.303
Here's a box for your stuff.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.021
I can't live in this!

20:28.557 --> 20:32.043
<i>May the calendar
keep bringing </i>

20:32.397 --> 20:35.733
<i>Happy holiday to...</i>

20:35.796 --> 20:38.950
<i>Ba-ba-bop-de-ba-you! </i>

20:42.766 --> 20:44.003
Grumply, grumply groo,

Christmas with you!

grumply Christmas, won't you? </i>
