10:10.278 --> 10:13.030
Pause there.
So, good stuff, you guys.

10:13.114 --> 10:16.450
Um, I think what we wanna do
is think in positives.

10:16.534 --> 10:18.995
So Natasha says,
"Here's a pen,"
you might add to that.

10:19.078 --> 10:22.790
You know, "Oh, thanks.
It's got an inscription.
It says 'Happy Anniversary.""

10:23.416 --> 10:26.002
Okay, cool. Yeah,
that's tight if you wanna
be doing improv forever,

10:26.085 --> 10:29.964
but I wanna do <i>Weekend Live.</i>
Like, how do you do that?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.465
You wait in line, Gary.

10:31.549 --> 10:32.675

you're keeping score.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.722
You know what I mean?
It's the sports of comedy.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.808
It's the only live sporting
event of comedy.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.561
But comedy
isn't a sport.
"Sports of comedy"?

10:43.644 --> 10:45.479
It shouldn't have
winners and losers,

10:45.563 --> 10:47.189
and there
shouldn't be points.

10:47.273 --> 10:50.026

I mean, they got Gary Cho and
then it's like, who else?

10:50.151 --> 10:52.611
You know what I mean?
Everybody else is...
LINDSAY: White.

10:52.695 --> 10:53.738
Even if it wasn't me,

10:53.821 --> 10:56.866
there should be
somebody else on this show
that represents another...

10:56.949 --> 10:58.451
Different shades
of white, certainly.
Right.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.995
Yes, definitely.
They've got eggshell...

Ecru to off-white
to almost ochre.

ochre performers.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.880
ALLISON: It was good
when I was little.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.799
Right. You know,
you never know if it was
good when you were little

11:13.883 --> 11:15.968
or you were just little,
so you didn't know.

11:16.052 --> 11:19.472
It's the great paradox
of <i>Weekend Live,</i>
is was it good ever?

11:19.555 --> 11:20.514
And can I...

11:20.598 --> 11:21.766
Or did we just think so
because we were 12?

11:21.849 --> 11:24.518
You really should not have
said that in your audition.
I think that...

11:24.602 --> 11:26.270
I brought that up
at my interview.

holding 10?

He's bringing over some
producers from <i>Weekend Live.</i>

Hey, Jack, don't pull some
showboat shit out there.

What are you talking about?
When do I do that?

You know
you always do that.

shows up, you turn into

from <i>Conan</i> came. You did it
when <i>Law and Order</i> came.

where's Bill?

He doesn't wanna miss this.
Where's he at?

Bill.

have a particularly hard day?

it was your dad,

Bill's dad had
a motorcycle accident.
Some truck hit it.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.345
He got hit.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.390
We're gonna go down to
Philadelphia tomorrow.
I'll get my dad's car.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.187
JACK: We actually have
some news, too.

19:47.271 --> 19:48.522
We have, um...

19:49.106 --> 19:52.192
We're auditioning
on Thursday
for <i>Weekend Live.</i>

19:54.444 --> 19:55.696
Congrats, man.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.114
Thanks, man.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.365
(SCOFFS)

19:58.448 --> 20:00.784
So, wait, <i>Weekend Live,</i>
they came to tonight's show?

20:00.868 --> 20:02.160
Yeah. It was like,
like Alicia and Hugh...

20:02.244 --> 20:04.204
Motherfucker.
Yeah. Sorry.

20:04.288 --> 20:05.330
LINDSAY: Sorry, buddy.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.124
They're not gonna come
again, right? That's it.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.500
JACK: They might.
The theater's closing.

20:08.584 --> 20:11.628
Maybe they'll wanna take
another shot. Maybe they'll
come again, you know?

20:12.212 --> 20:13.547
Probably not.

20:14.423 --> 20:15.716
I'm sorry.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.970
Do you know which
bits you're gonna do?

20:20.596 --> 20:22.890
We just heard like
10 minutes ago, so...

20:22.973 --> 20:25.434
You gotta do Alex Rodriguez
at the cell phone store.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.728
I forgot all about that one.
Oh, my gosh.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.564
BILL: You gotta do The Rock
when The Rock
loses all the weight.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.733
(GASPS) SlimFast Rock.
What did we call it?

20:32.816 --> 20:34.610
The Pebble.
The Pebble. Right.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.486
SAM: Jack.
"Can you smell what
The Pebble's cookin'?"

20:36.570 --> 20:38.906
"Not much. And that's why
I lost the weight."

20:39.406 --> 20:41.074
It's weird that they
didn't want me to audition.

20:41.158 --> 20:43.243
I mean, in some ways,
it makes sense.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.537
It's like they don't want
more generals,
they want infantry.

20:45.621 --> 20:47.623
Yeah. Yeah.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.084
MILES: So when I did it,
it was three characters,

20:51.168 --> 20:52.252
three impersonations.
What I did...

20:52.336 --> 20:54.379
LINDSAY: Nobody cares, Miles.
What are you doing, Sam?

20:54.463 --> 20:55.547
SAM: I don't know yet.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.007
LINDSAY: Jack, what are
you gonna do?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.842
Oh, you should do Uncle John!

20:59.343 --> 21:01.094
ALLISON: What's that one?
JACK: Okay, look.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.513
Kids down there makin' noise,
come down to the basement

21:03.597 --> 21:07.434
half in the bag,
talkin' 'bout... All you
kids in the basement!

21:08.018 --> 21:10.187
I ain't gonna have it
with none of y'all kids, man.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.190
Y'all down here,
you break anything,
you make any noise,

21:13.273 --> 21:14.942
then there's the door.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.778
Okay. Then what?
The premise of the character

21:17.861 --> 21:19.780
is just that he, like,
points to the door?

21:19.863 --> 21:23.700
That's always the way
he exclamation points
the end of the sentence.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.535
You kids in here
making noise.

21:25.619 --> 21:28.455
I don't want you in here,
breaking my antiques.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.291
There's the door.
There's the door.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.960
There's the door.
There's the door.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.878
Wait, Uncle John,
Uncle John.
What? What?

21:35.253 --> 21:38.840
Um, I'm Bambi
and I don't know
where my mom is.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.969
You know what?
There's the door.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.720
ALL: There's the door!

21:43.804 --> 21:45.055
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

21:46.890 --> 21:48.141
Uncle John, Uncle John.

21:48.225 --> 21:49.893
Yeah. What's goin' on?
I make pizza

21:49.977 --> 21:52.646
and I can find my sauce
and my cheese, but I can't
find the other part.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.064
It's right here, dude.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.316
There's the door.
There's the door!

21:56.650 --> 21:58.735
There's the door.
He's kneading the dough!

21:59.611 --> 22:01.363
LINDSAY: Miles,
it's weird when you do it.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.573
(ALL LAUGHING)

22:07.411 --> 22:10.789
We had to do an emergency
craniotomy to remove blood.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.667
Your dad understands
what happened and where he is,

22:13.750 --> 22:16.044
but he can't vocalize
more than a word or two.

22:19.423 --> 22:21.174
MAN: (ON TV)
<i>Okay, we are so far
past this point now</i>

22:21.258 --> 22:22.884
<i>trying to remember
when the turning point was,</i>

22:22.968 --> 22:25.303
<i>but there actually
was a turning point.</i>

22:25.387 --> 22:26.930
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

22:28.432 --> 22:29.933
(SOFTLY)
We should head out.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.145
We should head out.

22:40.694 --> 22:42.654
I'll come visit
again soon, Dad.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.157
(SOFTLY) Thank you.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.160
You're welcome, Dad.

22:49.828 --> 22:50.996
Bye, Mr. COUGHLIN.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.206
See you later, Mr. COUGHLIN.
Yeah, feel better,
Mr. COUGHLIN.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.876
ALLISON: See you soon.
LINDSAY: Bye, Mr. COUGHLIN.
We'll be back.

22:55.959 --> 22:56.960
All right.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.256
I know it's not about me,

23:02.049 --> 23:05.302
but I don't want
my dad to die
thinking I'm a failure.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.722
You're not a failure, Bill.
You're in The Commune.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.148
You know, Bill.

23:19.483 --> 23:23.153
I know it seems, like,
grim right now, but...

23:24.196 --> 23:26.156
Boy, he's really a fighter.

23:26.990 --> 23:27.991
Yeah.

23:28.784 --> 23:32.245
And there was that one moment
where he was like,
"Thank you."

23:32.829 --> 23:34.498
And that was actually
pretty good.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.334
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
He was really present.

23:37.751 --> 23:41.421
Yeah, he was like,
"Thank you."

23:43.673 --> 23:44.758
Miles, that's wrong.

23:44.841 --> 23:45.926
Are you doing
an impersonation?

23:46.009 --> 23:48.887
It was more like,
"Thank you."

23:48.970 --> 23:50.555
(ALL LAUGHING)

23:52.724 --> 23:55.936
JACK: Oh, Lindsay with
the sneak attack.
LINDSAY: "Thank you."

23:56.019 --> 23:59.481
ALL: "Thank you." "Thank you."

23:59.648 --> 24:00.774
JACK: No, that's Bob Dylan.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.779
I'm pretty sure
I'm the only one that
should impersonate my dad

24:05.862 --> 24:07.614
when he's basically
in a coma.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.117
Mine was good, though.
Oh, God, Miles!

24:10.200 --> 24:13.203
It was, it was pretty good,
but it was really
inappropriate.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.038
(ALL LAUGHING)

24:17.874 --> 24:20.293
"Thank you."
There we go!

24:23.547 --> 24:26.800
JACK: (MIMICKING LIAM NEESON)
Hello. Hello.
My name is Liam NEESON.

24:28.218 --> 24:31.805
If it's money that you're
looking for, I've got none.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.809
I've used all of it
the last six times
my daughter was taken.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.479
I mean, didn't you find it
very easy to kidnap her?

24:39.729 --> 24:42.065
<i>No, you and I should sit...
You go over there.</i>

24:43.400 --> 24:46.820
God, are we glued here?
We're glued here.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.698
<i>Can't we have
a stationary table?</i>

24:49.865 --> 24:52.951
Can't we get a table
that doesn't move?

24:53.034 --> 24:55.662
Nobody answers!
This business.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.247

<i>...that doesn't wobble here?</i>

24:58.081 --> 24:59.457

What?

25:00.500 --> 25:01.501
What?

25:02.335 --> 25:03.587
<i>I wanna put my feet on it.</i>

25:03.670 --> 25:04.754
Feet on it.

25:04.838 --> 25:06.590
Can't we get
a stationary table?

25:06.673 --> 25:09.342
Can't we get a stationary...

25:09.509 --> 25:12.762
Nobody listens in this...
Nobody!

25:13.054 --> 25:15.849
If one hair on her head
is harmed...
What, she's dead?

25:16.600 --> 25:19.227
Okay, well, to be
quite honest, there's
a bit of relief there.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.688
SAM: <i>So I was thinking
about doing Gena Rowlands...</i>

25:21.771 --> 25:23.940
JACK: Yeah?
From <i>A Woman
Under the Influence</i>

25:24.024 --> 25:25.108
as an umpire.

25:25.192 --> 25:29.112
Okay, well, that was
obscure in 1974, but okay.

25:29.613 --> 25:31.907
Yeah. Nick, you're out.

25:32.073 --> 25:33.366
What do you mean I'm out?
How could I be out?

25:33.450 --> 25:35.535
Nick, you missed
the base. You're out.
(BLOWS RASPBERRIES)

25:35.619 --> 25:37.621
Missed the base?
I didn't even swing!
Rain delay!

25:37.704 --> 25:40.040
I'm telling you,
I didn't swing at the ball!

25:40.123 --> 25:41.875
But you have to do
the porches thing, too.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.461
P-O-R-C-H-E-S.

Yes, Papa?

25:54.054 --> 25:55.305
You're the prettiest girl
in all of Brooklyn

25:55.388 --> 25:57.224
and if anyone
tells you different,
they're outta their minds.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.391
Oh, Papa.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.186
Look at these lips.
Those are kissable lips!

26:01.561 --> 26:03.063
What could you
do for my lips, Papa?

26:03.146 --> 26:04.981
Oh, I could do just about
anything. I could...

26:05.232 --> 26:08.026
Let me check the lips first
and we'll see
what we're doing here.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.825
Boy, my daughter's
good at everything.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.161
Just kidding.
You trained her well.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.039
All right,
we gotta get moving.

26:21.331 --> 26:26.795
Ooh, but an elf has confused
my legs for trees and sawed
them off for firewood.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.338
I'm serious. Here we go.

26:29.005 --> 26:32.342
Come on, Sam.
Can't we just lie
here in the meadow?

26:32.425 --> 26:33.593
Come on, Sam.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.512
Yes, magical tree.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.514
We can lie here
in the meadow.

26:37.681 --> 26:41.601
As long as that
meadow is the train.

Oh.

26:42.852 --> 26:43.895
Here we are, magical tree.

No, no, Jack, put me down.
We're going to our...

26:45.313 --> 26:46.273
Put me down.

26:46.356 --> 26:47.941
Sorry.
I need time.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.444
Well, we don't have
much time, hon.

26:51.528 --> 26:55.115
But yours is at 4:00
and mine's at 4:15,
so I'll just meet you there.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.621
I can wait. If you want me
to wait and stay with you?

27:01.705 --> 27:02.956
(IN CHILDLIKE VOICE)
Just go, Jack.

27:03.039 --> 27:06.126
I'll meet you there.
Don't worry about me.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.133
It's better if I meet
you there?

I did Ray Romano sings.

No! You shut up!

28:43.973 --> 28:45.809
JACK: A character
called the ticket taker.

28:45.892 --> 28:50.188
He's an old timey ticket taker
but he works
in a modern cineplex.

28:50.271 --> 28:52.899
And he doesn't understand,
he's like delusional.

28:52.982 --> 28:56.945
He thinks that we've lost
the classic kind
of feel of the cinema,

28:57.028 --> 28:59.906
and so he just...
He's stuck
in this world. So...

do they have to do?

29:49.873 --> 29:52.584
So then he says,
"That's how it goes."

29:53.710 --> 29:55.170
And then
I was like, "Okay."

29:55.253 --> 29:57.964
And so then I walk out
back into the lobby
out of his office

29:58.047 --> 30:00.175
and Gary Cho
was sitting there.

30:00.258 --> 30:02.677

Gary Cho says,

30:02.760 --> 30:04.762
"We're all really excited."

30:05.430 --> 30:07.098
And then I'm going,
"Uh-oh. What?"

30:07.182 --> 30:10.143
And at that moment,
Timothy's assistant
comes out of the office

30:11.519 --> 30:12.770

We showed up separately,

30:57.273 --> 31:00.902
and she hasn't texted me
back yet, so I don't know
what's going on.

do our shows.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.367
I don't know.
I don't, you know...

31:07.450 --> 31:09.911
I mean, it's late night,
it's just on the week days.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.580
I don't know
'cause you're writing
all the time.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.375
It's our first week.
I wanna put my best
foot forward and...

31:15.458 --> 31:17.293
There she is. There she is.
Oh, my God.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.463
Hi, I'm so sorry
I missed the show.
How was it?

31:20.713 --> 31:21.881
BILL: It doesn't matter.
JACK: How'd it go?

31:21.965 --> 31:23.341
What happened?
How'd it go?

31:23.424 --> 31:25.009
Um...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

31:26.135 --> 31:28.054
I was late and they
wouldn't let me in.

31:28.137 --> 31:29.264
JACK: What? Why? Why?

31:29.347 --> 31:31.599
I don't know.
JACK: Well,
how late were you?

31:32.725 --> 31:34.185
I was like 20 minutes
late, so...

31:34.269 --> 31:35.270
You were 20 minutes late?

31:35.353 --> 31:37.480
Wait, you were 20 minutes late
and they wouldn't let you in?

31:37.564 --> 31:39.649
All right, maybe I was
like 30 minutes late.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.109
But, oh, my,
how was it for you?

31:41.192 --> 31:43.111
No, listen, I told you
that I would wait for you.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.821
I told you
that I would go...

31:45.488 --> 31:47.740
SAM: I know, I know.
How was it for you, though?

31:48.074 --> 31:50.034
Honey, yeah, I got the show.

31:50.702 --> 31:51.703
I got it.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.162
(CHUCKLES)

31:53.246 --> 31:54.956
That's great.
Yeah, yeah.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.332
That's...

31:56.416 --> 31:57.500
Honey, but I...

31:58.751 --> 31:59.752
Thank you.

32:00.086 --> 32:03.047
I just wanted us both
to get it, you know? I really
wanted us both to get it.

32:03.131 --> 32:04.090
I know.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.174
(SIGHS)

32:10.847 --> 32:12.849
Look, guys, this is, um...

32:13.683 --> 32:16.728
(STAMMERS)
This is a victory
for the whole group.

32:17.854 --> 32:20.648
Okay? 'Cause I'm gonna...
You mean you'll talk
to Timothy about us?

32:20.732 --> 32:21.774
Uh...

32:21.858 --> 32:25.153
When you talk to him
my name's Bill.
Just to remind you.

32:25.236 --> 32:27.447
I'm Bill. We've known
each other many years.

32:27.530 --> 32:30.283
MILES: A lot of guys who
get on that show can hire
their own writers,

32:30.366 --> 32:31.784
or, you know, suggest it.
Seriously.

32:31.868 --> 32:32.869
JACK: Yeah. I mean, I'm...

32:33.411 --> 32:36.039
MILES: To Jack, everybody!
To Jack! Cheers! All right!

32:37.457 --> 32:38.541
This is huge.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.418
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:51.638 --> 32:53.222
Bill.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.521
I was Jack's
first teacher, actually.

33:00.605 --> 33:01.606
Oh...

33:02.315 --> 33:04.734
You're my first teacher.
Exactly.

33:04.942 --> 33:05.943
(CHUCKLES)

33:07.070 --> 33:08.571
That's cool.
Crazy.

33:08.613 --> 33:10.948
Yeah.
Yeah, it's just like,
anything could happen.

33:11.741 --> 33:14.494
I was just so in it,
and I felt,
if I don't get this,

33:14.577 --> 33:16.120
I'm gonna kill myself.

33:16.746 --> 33:19.707
I literally thought that.
And I believe that to be true.

33:19.791 --> 33:22.960
You mean like,
if you had to live our lives?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.672
Like if you had to
continue living like us,

33:25.755 --> 33:26.839
you'd kill yourself?
No, no.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.716
I mean, I don't have OCD.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.176
I used to when I was a kid.

33:30.259 --> 33:33.846
I had it kinda like,
basically I had this thing
with picture frames.

33:33.930 --> 33:35.765
Like, if I saw
a picture frame,

33:35.848 --> 33:37.517
I would have to touch
the four corners of it,

33:37.600 --> 33:39.310
but it would, like,
it would have to feel right.

33:39.519 --> 33:42.980
If you wanna talk to anybody,
I have a great therapist.

33:43.064 --> 33:46.109
(CLICKS TONGUE)
That's so sweet of you,
but I'm fine.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.402
Okay. I know.
I'm fine.

33:47.485 --> 33:49.779
She's always struggled
with this. It's like, um...

33:50.321 --> 33:54.492
She ran away from home
when she was 16 and, yeah,
to become a ballerina.

33:55.493 --> 33:58.579
Like an actual,
like pointe toes...
Yeah.

33:58.663 --> 34:00.873
Pirouettes and all that?
<i>Nutcracker,</i> yeah.

34:00.957 --> 34:03.042
Had a <i>Black Swan</i> kinda thing
and like, it didn't work out.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.544
She's great,
but it didn't work out,

34:04.627 --> 34:06.587
and then she started
coming to Commune shows,

34:06.671 --> 34:09.047
and she became kind of
obsessed with our group,

34:09.132 --> 34:10.925
and then I asked her
to join the group.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.135
Wow.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.321
Sam, honey.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.326
Honey, what happened?

34:37.869 --> 34:40.871
Okay, I mean, you can't just
have been 20 minutes late.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.542
Doesn't matter.

34:50.465 --> 34:52.507

35:44.894 --> 35:46.229

Where you going?

35:48.189 --> 35:49.690
Uh... (SIGHS)

35:49.774 --> 35:52.318
I kinda feel like a whore.

35:52.401 --> 35:54.403
What do you mean?
We had a great time.

35:54.654 --> 35:55.947
Ugh! You're, like, 40.

35:59.492 --> 36:01.661
I just turned 36.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.664
I need you to
teach my classes.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.833
Why?
I can't take it anymore.

36:06.916 --> 36:10.670
Another one of my students
gets my dream job
and I'm still teaching 101?

36:10.753 --> 36:13.548
I gotta focus on me.
Writing for me.

36:13.631 --> 36:15.341
(STAMMERS) I'm gonna get
the job at <i>Weekend Live.</i>

36:15.424 --> 36:17.844
That's good for you, Miles,
but I can't teach.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.346
Why?
I'm good in a group.

36:20.429 --> 36:21.973
I'm no good on my own.

BILL:
<i>What's that phrase? Uh...</i>

36:33.150 --> 36:37.488
"A house is made of brick
and stone, but a home
is made of love alone"?

36:38.281 --> 36:39.532
You ever hear that one?

36:41.576 --> 36:43.077
No, Greg, I haven't.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.954
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

36:47.164 --> 36:48.666
I read it... Uh...

36:49.166 --> 36:51.919
It was like, hanging up
in a doctor's office one time.

36:52.712 --> 36:53.713
(CLICKS TONGUE)

36:55.631 --> 36:59.343
You guys ever heard a phrase
that's like, "A bird in the
hand is like two in a bush"?

36:59.427 --> 37:01.304
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

37:01.387 --> 37:03.222
I heard that one.
Yeah?

37:03.306 --> 37:06.183
Yeah. You guys
ever heard that phrase,

37:06.267 --> 37:07.518
"There's nothing
that feels better

37:07.602 --> 37:10.605
"than feeling someone's
last breath come
out of their mouth"?

37:12.732 --> 37:16.694
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I heard that one.
I heard that one.

37:17.361 --> 37:19.196
What about, like,
that one where it's like,

37:19.280 --> 37:21.449
"The final drop of blood
in a man's body

37:21.532 --> 37:23.367
"is the sweetest nectar
you'll ever drink"?

37:23.701 --> 37:25.912
Yeah. Yeah.

37:26.329 --> 37:28.039
So, I met this guy.

37:29.081 --> 37:32.251
He owns this space
up in Midtown.
It's kind of fancy for us.

37:32.335 --> 37:34.962
It's mostly like jazz
and classical music
and stuff,

37:35.046 --> 37:37.465
but he said we could
rent it on one of
the off-nights.

37:37.548 --> 37:38.883
We might even be able
to make some money.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.259
Really?

37:40.343 --> 37:42.511
Yeah.
Wow, is it expensive, or...

37:42.678 --> 37:46.641
That's the thing.
We would have to
front like $4,000.

37:46.724 --> 37:50.269
But once we match it in
ticket sales, we split up
any profits.

37:50.353 --> 37:52.730
MILES: That sounds good.
Can we see the space?

37:53.272 --> 37:55.316
Hey. Come on, guys, look.

37:55.399 --> 37:57.568
Is this a lovely room, huh?
It's nice.

37:57.860 --> 37:58.986
ALLISON: Is that a Steinway?

37:59.070 --> 38:00.863
Biggest one in this city.

38:00.947 --> 38:02.281
It's got a good vibe.
You know?

38:02.365 --> 38:05.201
BILL: <i>He seems like
he really likes our show,
but he also seems like,</i>

38:05.618 --> 38:08.871
if I'm being honest,
like he's slimy enough
to get it done.

38:08.955 --> 38:10.247
ALLISON: Yeah.
Good slimy.

38:10.373 --> 38:12.333
You know?
I've actually
got to get going,

38:12.416 --> 38:14.669
but, um,
I'll see you at 9:00?

38:15.544 --> 38:16.963
Can we make it 9:30?

38:17.046 --> 38:18.214
What are you guys
working on?

38:18.798 --> 38:20.508
Writing packet
for <i>Weekend Live.</i>

38:20.591 --> 38:22.760
Cool. I would
get in on that.

38:24.261 --> 38:25.388
What do you mean?

38:25.888 --> 38:28.724
Like I'd submit
with you guys as a team.

38:29.809 --> 38:31.769
Writing teams are two people.

38:32.812 --> 38:34.563
And we already kinda...

38:37.066 --> 38:40.111
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
No, I'll do one,
I'll do my own.

38:41.821 --> 38:44.615
JACK: <i>They should all, like,
you want the scenes,
guys, to run about</i>

38:44.740 --> 38:46.909
<i>three minutes
to four minutes, tops.</i>
BILL: <i>Gotcha.</i>

38:46.993 --> 38:50.496
<i>The whole packet should
have like three parody pieces,
a commercial piece,</i>

38:50.579 --> 38:51.789
<i>a political piece.
That's good.</i>

38:51.872 --> 38:53.541
ALLISON: <i>Do you think
they would want, like,
a cartoon form?</i>

38:53.624 --> 38:55.960
<i>Like, 'cause I was
thinking about, like,
drawing them out a little bit</i>

38:56.043 --> 38:57.878
<i>so like, they read it
almost like a comic.</i>

38:57.962 --> 39:01.674
JACK: <i>Maybe draw
a couple little cartoons
next to the script.</i>

39:01.924 --> 39:04.343
ALLISON: So there's this girl
and she's on a dating show,

39:04.427 --> 39:06.846
and she doesn't know
that she's fighting

39:06.929 --> 39:10.016
to win the love of an alien
and Sasquatch and
Abe Lincoln's ghost.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.976
All right.
And then she wins Abe Lincoln

39:12.059 --> 39:13.728
and then he's like,
"I can't 'cause I'm married."

39:13.811 --> 39:17.189
And she's like, "Well, then,
why did you even
join this game show?"

39:17.273 --> 39:19.191
And then he's like,
""Cause I had a gun
to my head."

39:19.275 --> 39:20.735
And then it's actually...

39:20.818 --> 39:24.530
It's John Wilkes Booth
and he's gonna shoot him.

39:24.822 --> 39:26.907
And then
John Wilkes Booth is,
like, a handsome ghost,

39:26.991 --> 39:28.492
and he's like,
"Well, I'm single."

39:28.576 --> 39:30.703
And she's into it
'cause she likes ghosts.

39:30.786 --> 39:32.371
That's out there.
That's awesome.

39:32.788 --> 39:35.624
Gary Cho could
play that Sasquatch,
no problem.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.711
No problem.
It's too plot heavy.

39:39.336 --> 39:40.629
I don't like it.

39:41.964 --> 39:42.923
(LAUGHTER)

39:43.007 --> 39:45.176
MAN: Or they have to order
for him 'cause they're like...

39:55.269 --> 39:59.440
Hey, I've got a few friends
that want to submit
some writing.

39:59.523 --> 40:03.235
Um, when would be, like,
a good time to talk to
Timothy about that?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.112
Is this like a bit?

40:05.196 --> 40:06.572
No, no. No, I'm just asking.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.199
Oh, this is like
a real thing?

40:08.491 --> 40:09.909
Oh, never.

40:09.992 --> 40:13.329
Don't ever talk to Timothy
about your funny friends.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.790
First year,
just don't get fired.

40:15.873 --> 40:18.375
Right, right.
So don't ever...

40:18.459 --> 40:20.127
So just don't ever do
it during the first year?

40:20.211 --> 40:24.381
I'm sorry. Was I...
Was my, like, tone
not sarcastic enough?

40:24.465 --> 40:26.467
Never do it. Ever.

40:33.808 --> 40:34.809
Um...

40:35.267 --> 40:36.268
Um...

40:37.394 --> 40:41.315
So I'm filling in
for Miles today.

40:41.398 --> 40:44.944
I have to confess,
this is my first-ever
time teaching

40:45.027 --> 40:46.445
so it's new for me,
it's new for you,

40:46.529 --> 40:47.822
but I think
it's gonna be great.

40:47.905 --> 40:50.074
I really think you guys...

40:50.366 --> 40:53.285
I see bright shiny eyes
and you're making
me happy. Um...

40:54.078 --> 40:55.412
What did I wanna
talk to you about?

40:55.496 --> 40:59.750
I wanted to talk to you
about group mind.

41:00.376 --> 41:03.170
We're on the verge.
I feel it, right?
So I want...

41:03.254 --> 41:05.464
Even when
you're just coming in

41:05.548 --> 41:07.633
and doing warm-ups,
zip zap zop,

41:07.716 --> 41:10.678
I want you guys
to really be connecting
with each other.

41:10.761 --> 41:11.762
Um...

41:12.763 --> 41:14.598
Does anybody
have any questions?

41:15.891 --> 41:17.017
Yes.
I'm sorry.

41:17.101 --> 41:19.687
I'm just finding
this really confusing.

41:22.022 --> 41:23.399
Good note. Good note.

41:23.566 --> 41:27.570
(APPLAUSE)
Uh, has anybody had
a particularly hard day?

41:27.903 --> 41:30.281

I had to come back
from France early.

41:30.364 --> 41:31.323
(IN A NASAL VOICE) Oh!

41:31.407 --> 41:33.701
(ALL LAUGHING)

41:34.618 --> 41:36.245
Oh!

41:37.288 --> 41:39.206
I went to Europe...

41:39.290 --> 41:41.625
Oh, the poor girl.
And I had to come home early!

41:41.709 --> 41:43.711
The poor girl had
to go to Europe.
You guys...

41:43.794 --> 41:45.546
I had to go to France.

41:45.629 --> 41:47.923
Oh, honey.
She had to go to Europe.

41:48.007 --> 41:50.426

anything we can do? I...

41:51.427 --> 41:54.722
This is really depressing.
I don't... I'm sorry...

41:54.805 --> 41:58.601
I donate, uh, at the office
for kids who have to
come back...

41:58.851 --> 42:00.895
Oh, yeah.
Back from Europe.

42:00.978 --> 42:03.647
I was gonna go to Belgium.

42:03.731 --> 42:04.815

42:05.191 --> 42:07.151
Is there anything
you can do?

42:07.318 --> 42:09.195
I don't know.
I mean, I'm kind of

42:09.278 --> 42:11.655
dealing with
my own stuff right now.

42:12.156 --> 42:13.699

What kind of stuff?

42:13.782 --> 42:15.409

42:24.001 --> 42:25.878
Hey.
Liz was at the show tonight.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.463
We went to Naperville
High School together.
Hi.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.547
ALLISON: Oh, wow. Hi.

42:28.631 --> 42:29.715
LIZ: We used to do high
school theater together.

42:29.798 --> 42:30.799
We did high school theater.

42:30.883 --> 42:32.134
We did
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

42:32.218 --> 42:33.427
That's right. Yeah.

42:33.510 --> 42:34.720
I used to watch her change.

What?
(LAUGHTER)

42:36.680 --> 42:40.142
Yeah, that's right.
True story. Weird.
LIZ: That's terrible.

42:40.226 --> 42:42.728
This was such a nice surprise.
Oh.

42:42.937 --> 42:45.231
Well, you know,
I'm on my world tour.

42:45.314 --> 42:46.690
And I've been
following your posts

42:46.774 --> 42:48.692
on Facebook about
The Commune for years,

42:48.776 --> 42:50.402
so I had to check it out.
That's so cool.

42:50.486 --> 42:53.405
I remember in high school,
you were like
the star of every play,

42:53.489 --> 42:56.951

like the milkman
or the messenger.

Narrator.

42:58.869 --> 43:02.456

but neither am I.

43:10.756 --> 43:13.467
Wow. This is
moving pretty fast.

43:13.550 --> 43:16.095
No, no, gosh. No, I...

43:17.012 --> 43:19.682
I wasn't gonna
suggest that we...

43:19.765 --> 43:21.267
I'm not staying here.

43:21.350 --> 43:22.768
No, no, no, I didn't
think that you would.

43:22.851 --> 43:24.311
I'm a 36-year-old woman.
I'm not gonna

43:24.395 --> 43:25.980
stay in, like,
your college dorm.

43:26.063 --> 43:27.940
No, no, of course.
Here, no, sorry.

I'm 36 as well.

for a few weeks.

as much as, you know...

my schedule allows?

I don't have the goods?

53:01.388 --> 53:04.516

work on the goods
instead of working on Jack.

53:04.599 --> 53:05.934
Do the work.

53:06.017 --> 53:07.686
MILES: Oh, I've been
working on the goods.

53:09.271 --> 53:11.022
What are you doing?

53:11.231 --> 53:14.442
Like, are you
working right now? Are you
applying for anything?

53:14.526 --> 53:16.319
Uh, unemployment.

53:17.863 --> 53:19.364
Unemployment?

53:19.531 --> 53:23.034
Your parents
own a brownstone
on the Upper West Side.

53:23.201 --> 53:25.787
Yeah, they do.
I'm separate from them.

53:27.080 --> 53:29.416
You go to therapy
twice a week.
Who pays for that?

53:30.083 --> 53:31.710
LINDSAY: I'm not having
this conversation.

53:32.961 --> 53:35.463
MILES: <i>I just think it's weird
that you're the richest one
among us</i>

53:35.547 --> 53:37.215
and you get checks
from the government that

53:37.299 --> 53:40.302
we in some way pay for.
Don't you think
that's true, Mr. COUGHLIN?

53:40.385 --> 53:43.138
Miles, you gotta
let this one go.

53:43.221 --> 53:44.222

Hey, look what
I got for you!
(DOG BARKING)

53:47.309 --> 53:49.561
My dad bought two tickets

53:49.644 --> 53:53.148
to the Marshfield High School
production of <i>Peter Pan.</i>

You look like Peter Pan.

he's just nostalgic for

53:58.778 --> 54:01.656
back when I was
the star of every play.
You know?

54:02.365 --> 54:03.992
When I was
in high school,

54:04.075 --> 54:07.245
I won the Eisner Award for
most promising cartoonist,

54:07.329 --> 54:09.998
and I've never had
one book published.
(CHUCKLES)

54:11.625 --> 54:14.586
Data's working on
this graphic novel.
It's amazing.

54:14.669 --> 54:16.087
Mmm.
Oh, I don't know.

54:16.171 --> 54:17.297
What's it about?

54:18.423 --> 54:19.424
Okay.

54:19.716 --> 54:23.762
So it's about this girl
and she lives in
this small town

54:23.845 --> 54:26.181
and then,
well, she's a sculptor

54:26.264 --> 54:27.849
and then the whole town
saves up money

54:27.933 --> 54:29.684
and sends her to
the sculpture academy

54:29.768 --> 54:32.646
and then when she gets there,
she never sculpts again.

54:32.729 --> 54:33.897
Why not?

54:33.980 --> 54:35.190
Because she's intimidated.

54:36.691 --> 54:37.692
Can we read it?

54:38.818 --> 54:40.862
Well, it's not done yet.

put stuff in here.

wear these in shows.

I'm so small.

56:53.495 --> 56:54.954
They were fun to wear.

Not a bad idea.

Like, without The Commune,
who am I?

57:45.171 --> 57:47.632
You know, it's like
when I go to the grocery store

57:47.715 --> 57:49.801
and people treat me
like I don't exist.

57:49.884 --> 57:51.553

"Well, I got a secret.

Yeah. In Brazil.
And everyone was quiet.

I could hear myself think
for the first time,

58:17.328 --> 58:18.746
I think, in my whole life.

58:18.830 --> 58:20.582
I bet you got in
trouble for humming.

58:20.999 --> 58:22.667
What do you mean?
'Cause you hum.

58:22.750 --> 58:23.751
I remember that
from algebra class.

58:23.835 --> 58:24.836
What?

58:24.919 --> 58:27.589

used to get mad
because you would hum

58:27.672 --> 58:28.965
while you were
doing equations.

58:29.048 --> 58:31.718
You'd get this
faraway look in your eye
and you'd just start humming.

58:31.801 --> 58:34.053
I could never figure out
what the song was.

58:35.054 --> 58:37.015

way too much about me.

of the iceberg.

me out.

in my college dorm?

Yes, you did. You totally did.

Jack played on TV, yeah.

Hi.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:15.770
Great show. Great show,
you guys were great.
Really, really funny.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:18.022
Uh, thanks, but you
don't have to say that.

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:20.441
No, I know
I don't have to say it.

01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:22.068
Right. Right.

BEN: You guys were great.

01:04:24.153 --> 01:04:26.948
Okay,
I'm sorry, I have to ask,
I've always wondered.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:29.700
Like, when you wake up
in the morning,
are you just like,

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:32.703
"Oh, my God,
I'm Ben Stiller"?
BEN: Um... (CLICKS TONGUE)

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.874
Yeah. Probably in the same way
you wake up in
the morning and go,

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.543
"I'm Allison."

an unlikable character.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:47.969
Like,
what gives you that courage?

01:04:48.052 --> 01:04:49.512
BEN: (CLICKS TONGUE)
Um... Wow.

01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:54.308
You know,
I never really thought
of myself as unlikable, but...

01:04:54.392 --> 01:04:55.977
Oh... I didn't...
You're not.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.896
BEN: No, no, no,
I'm just saying as
the character, obviously...

01:04:59.272 --> 01:05:00.314
You know.

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:04.151
Did you think that
the <i>Reality Bites</i> guy
was unlikable?

01:05:04.527 --> 01:05:07.446
My question is who wrote
the Eddie Munster sketch?
Did you write it?

01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:10.658
Uh, yeah, yeah.
With my buddy, Jeff Kahn.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.285
That's the best sketch.

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:13.578
That's such a...
It was the best.

01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:14.912
Long time ago.

01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:16.289

you were unlikable in that.

BEN: Oh, no, no, no.
I know. I mean, I'm just...

01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:20.167
Is the bathroom
right over here?
Yeah, right over there.

01:05:20.251 --> 01:05:22.044
All right, be right back.
Yeah?
Just go to the right there.

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:23.087

Why? Why? Why?

01:05:39.437 --> 01:05:41.689
'Cause I don't wanna
get scolded tonight.

I'm not gonna scold you.
Why, was I...

01:05:44.275 --> 01:05:45.359
Am I scolding?

Was I scolding you guys?

There are two types
of bad shows.

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:56.621
There's the type
of bad show where

01:05:56.704 --> 01:05:58.289
you all sell
each other out onstage

01:05:58.372 --> 01:05:59.790
and nobody
hangs out afterwards

01:05:59.874 --> 01:06:01.375
and then there's
the type of bad show

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.085
where you all go down together

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:05.963
and then you come
to the bar afterwards
and you laugh about it.

01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:08.466
And that is
the type of bad show
that I want you guys to have.

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:10.217
Yeah, no, yeah,
we do that all the time.

01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:11.969

each other, okay?

01:06:12.053 --> 01:06:14.472
You gotta be
willing to be broke.

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:17.933
You gotta be willing
to hit rock bottom.

Oh, we're definitely broke.

a one bedroom in Bushwick.

comes to your mind.

hurts my feelings.

01:06:32.657 --> 01:06:34.075
20 years from now,
oceans are gonna rise

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:35.493
and wipe out
the Eastern Seaboard

01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:36.911
and no one's gonna care
who made what album

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:38.663
whereas the Beach Boys
has already had a 50-year run.

01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:40.247

about <i>Pet Sounds</i> now

what, in '67?

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:43.918
No, nobody's
talking about <i>Pet Sounds.</i>

are people gonna
know who Drake is?

JOSH: Once the Eastern
Seaboard's flooded

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:50.341
are you gonna care
about the Beach Boys?
I would argue that...

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:52.093
SAM: Yeah, more! More!
Surfing songs
will be more relevant.

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:53.761
Because there'd be
more water surface area.

wanted to look at 'em.

what we call a pure talent.

who should write for himself.

Yeah, buddy, absolutely, man.

01:22:52.636 --> 01:22:55.555
Thanks for letting
me and Liz and Rodrigo
crash in the guest room.

01:22:55.639 --> 01:22:56.890
Yeah, no sweat, man.

01:22:57.057 --> 01:22:58.642
He has your eyes, you know?

01:22:58.725 --> 01:22:59.726
(LAUGHS)

01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:01.394
Not my biological son.
(LAUGHTER)

01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:04.064
LINDSAY: I don't know.
You look pretty Brazilian.

01:23:04.314 --> 01:23:08.026
BILL: Yeah,
and the consistency
of the hair is uncanny.

01:23:08.109 --> 01:23:09.110

(MIMICKING MR. COUGHLIN)
"Thank you."

01:23:11.363 --> 01:23:12.572
BILL: Aw, man!

01:23:12.656 --> 01:23:15.533
That is entirely unacceptable.
He's dead.

01:23:15.784 --> 01:23:17.827
That's a dead man
you're mocking.

01:23:17.911 --> 01:23:21.081
ALLISON, LINDSAY AND SAM:
(MIMICKING MR. COUGHLIN)
"Thank you."

01:23:21.206 --> 01:23:24.167
Um, I just called
a car to come get Jack,

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.543
bring him to
the train station,

01:23:25.627 --> 01:23:27.796
so maybe we'll
wait outside for that,
and then after that,

01:23:27.879 --> 01:23:29.381
I can show you
guys the theater.

01:23:30.256 --> 01:23:32.425
Oh, yeah? What's the theater?

01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:36.012
BILL: Well, my dad
actually bought this
old porn theater

01:23:36.096 --> 01:23:40.016
and we're gonna fix it up,
turn it into an improv space.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:42.143
ALLISON: Yeah, we're gonna
teach and have shows.

01:23:42.227 --> 01:23:44.270
We're actually doing a show
for Data's graphic novel.

01:23:44.354 --> 01:23:46.106
SAM: Oh!
LINDSAY: You finished it.

01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:48.108
Yeah.

JACK: Yeah.

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:53.613
Well, here we go, guys.

01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:56.032
Bye, Jack.
Have a good one.
See ya.

01:23:56.116 --> 01:23:57.492
See ya, see ya. Bye-bye.

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:05.667
You know,
I think maybe I'll go to

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:07.502
the theater with you guys.
How 'bout that?

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:09.921
No. It's the last
train to New York.
You gotta get on it.

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:12.632
Yeah, but...
You know you're
cutting it close.

01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:23.601
We love you, pal.

01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:28.064
LINDSAY: All right,
I'll see you Monday at work.

01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:31.776
Billy.

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:36.239
ALLISON: Got your back.

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:41.494
Bye.

SAM: (GASPS) Wow.

01:25:21.785 --> 01:25:23.328
Come on!

01:25:23.536 --> 01:25:26.956
Well, it needs a lot
of work, but it's ours.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.250
We get to
program the whole thing

01:25:29.334 --> 01:25:30.794
and we're just
gonna try to find some,

01:25:30.877 --> 01:25:32.212
like,
local kids who are hungry,

01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:34.547
try to build a scene
here in town, you know?

01:25:35.048 --> 01:25:37.634
Has anyone had
a particularly hard day?

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:40.053
You.

01:25:41.012 --> 01:25:43.556
I buried my dad.
