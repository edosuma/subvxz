WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:05.189
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.356 --> 00:07.400
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.567 --> 00:10.486
<i>or breathed real air,
or floated in the water.</i>

00:10.695 --> 00:12.322
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:12.947 --> 00:15.325
<i>For three generations,
the Ark has kept what's left</i>

00:15.491 --> 00:19.120
<i>of the human race alive,
but now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.287 --> 00:22.206
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.373 --> 00:25.793
<i>One hundred prisoners sent on
a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:26.294 --> 00:28.379
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.546 --> 00:30.673
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:30.840 --> 00:32.467
<i>All we have to do is survive.</i>

00:32.634 --> 00:35.219
<i>But we will be tested,
by the Earth,</i>

00:35.386 --> 00:39.223
<i>By the secrets it hides,
and most of all by each other.</i>

00:41.267 --> 00:42.602
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:42.894 --> 00:44.872
<i>We know they've landed,
but communications are down.</i>

00:44.896 --> 00:47.065
This wristband transmits
your vital signs to the Ark.

00:47.231 --> 00:49.192
Take them off,
and the Ark will think we're dying.

00:49.359 --> 00:50.360
That's the point.

00:50.526 --> 00:52.421
They've dumped
you down here like lab rats to die,

00:52.445 --> 00:53.565
so why are you helping them?

00:53.613 --> 00:55.591
- Chancellor's been shot.
<i>- We have ID'ed the shooter.</i>

00:55.615 --> 00:56.616
<i>Bellamy Blake.</i>

00:56.783 --> 00:59.285
I did something they will
kill me for when they come down.

00:59.452 --> 01:01.746
Do you see that peak over there?
That's Mount Weather.

01:01.913 --> 01:04.415
There's a radiation-soaked forest
between us and our next meal.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.084
We did it!

01:08.169 --> 01:09.212
We are not alone.

01:13.466 --> 01:14.551
Clarke!

01:29.273 --> 01:30.483
Monty.

01:30.650 --> 01:31.734
Come on! We got to go!

01:31.901 --> 01:33.277
Monty, get up!

01:37.782 --> 01:39.033
Who are they?

01:43.663 --> 01:45.039
What are they?

01:46.165 --> 01:47.709
We are so screwed.

01:52.922 --> 01:54.799
Jasper. He's alive.

01:55.299 --> 01:57.093
Clarke, wait. Wait!

01:59.429 --> 02:01.347
Wait. Stay out of the trees.

02:02.849 --> 02:04.308
He was right there.

02:04.475 --> 02:05.935
No. Where is he?

02:08.354 --> 02:09.939
They took him.

02:31.753 --> 02:34.297
- Talk to me, Jackson.
- Rumors are spreading.

02:34.464 --> 02:35.744
Witnesses saw a dropship launch.

02:36.299 --> 02:38.152
It's only a matter of time
till the people figure out

02:38.176 --> 02:39.536
that we sent The 100
to the ground.

02:39.594 --> 02:41.029
Let the council worry
about the people.

02:41.053 --> 02:44.182
I need you focused on reestablishing
communication with those kids.

02:45.183 --> 02:46.476
How many dark tiles?

02:46.642 --> 02:49.687
Twenty three. We've been losing them
at a steady rate all day.

02:49.854 --> 02:51.606
Abby, these are different.

02:51.773 --> 02:54.192
Vital signs spike for a
longer duration before flat line.

02:54.358 --> 02:55.651
It looks like a pain response.

02:55.818 --> 02:58.005
This is what we'd expect to
see with exposure to radiation.

02:58.029 --> 03:01.115
I know what it looks like, Jackson,
but there's another explanation.

03:04.243 --> 03:05.703
We just haven't found it yet.

03:06.078 --> 03:07.830
Chancellor on deck.

03:20.676 --> 03:22.178
My son.

03:32.730 --> 03:34.607
- We sent them down to die.
- No.

03:34.774 --> 03:36.025
We sent them down to live.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.421
To go to Earth
to see if it was survivable

03:39.445 --> 03:41.572
- so that all of us could live.
- Abby, stop.

03:42.907 --> 03:44.659
I know this is hard,

03:44.826 --> 03:47.620
but we don't have time
for false hope.

03:48.830 --> 03:51.082
This space station is dying,
and Earth is not survivable.

03:51.249 --> 03:52.851
That is what the wristbands
are telling us.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.515
We don't know
what they're telling us yet.

03:58.214 --> 04:01.259
Thelonious, listen to me.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.303
Please trust me.

04:05.096 --> 04:07.431
For all we know, those kids
could be perfectly fine...

04:08.057 --> 04:09.684
...including Wells.

04:45.428 --> 04:46.929
Get him!

04:48.222 --> 04:49.807
Way to go!

04:52.977 --> 04:54.854
I got it, I got it!

04:55.730 --> 04:56.731
Get back here!

04:56.898 --> 04:58.566
- Move!
- Take it!

05:00.484 --> 05:01.903
<i>Did you see that?</i>

05:10.494 --> 05:11.996
Hey, where'd you get the clothes?

05:12.163 --> 05:14.624
Buried the two kids who died
during the landing.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.350
Smart. You know,
I'll take it from here.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.769
There's always a market for...

05:17.793 --> 05:19.670
We share based on need,
just like back home.

05:19.837 --> 05:21.881
You still don't get it,
do you, Chancellor?

05:27.345 --> 05:29.305
This is home now.

05:29.472 --> 05:32.266
Your father's rules no longer apply.

05:33.726 --> 05:36.020
Oh, no, no, Atom. Atom, hold up.

05:36.187 --> 05:38.689
You want it back?
Take it.

05:45.571 --> 05:46.989
Get those boots!

05:47.156 --> 05:49.116
Is this what you want? Chaos?

05:49.450 --> 05:50.770
What's wrong with a little chaos?

05:57.792 --> 05:59.210
Bellamy.

05:59.377 --> 06:00.962
Check it out.
We want the Ark to think

06:01.128 --> 06:02.838
that the ground is killing us, right?

06:03.005 --> 06:04.942
Figure it'll look better
if we suffer a little bit first.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.509
Let her go!

06:09.387 --> 06:11.472
- You can stop this.
- Stop this?

06:12.223 --> 06:13.307
I'm just getting started.

06:16.352 --> 06:17.895
<i>Fight!</i>

06:35.579 --> 06:37.581
Don't you see you can't control this?

06:42.044 --> 06:43.254
You're dead.

06:43.879 --> 06:44.880
Wait.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.346
Fair fight.

06:57.435 --> 06:58.894
<i>Pick it up.</i>

07:00.104 --> 07:01.605
- Come on, do it.
<i>- Let's</i> go.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.118
This is for my father!

07:17.163 --> 07:18.414
Drop it!

07:18.789 --> 07:20.374
Wells!

07:22.084 --> 07:23.669
Let him go!

07:26.172 --> 07:28.883
- Whoa.
- Hey! Enough, Murphy.

07:29.467 --> 07:31.635
Octavia. Are you all right?

07:32.094 --> 07:33.471
Yeah.

07:33.804 --> 07:35.139
Where's the food?

07:37.141 --> 07:38.452
We didn't make it to Mount Weather.

07:38.476 --> 07:39.852
What the hell happened out there?

07:40.019 --> 07:41.353
We were attacked.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.148
Attacked? By what?

07:44.315 --> 07:46.859
Not what. Who.

07:47.026 --> 07:51.072
It turns out, when the last man
from the ground died on the Ark,

07:51.238 --> 07:53.157
he wasn't the last Grounder.

07:53.324 --> 07:54.492
It's true.

07:54.658 --> 07:57.328
Everything we thought we knew
about the ground is wrong.

07:57.495 --> 08:00.372
There are people here, survivors.

08:01.415 --> 08:04.418
The good news is,
that means we can survive.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.087
Radiation won't kill us.

08:06.504 --> 08:08.631
Yeah, the bad news is
the Grounders will.

08:10.841 --> 08:12.161
Where's the kid with the goggles?

08:13.552 --> 08:15.679
Jasper was hit.

08:15.846 --> 08:17.223
They took him.

08:18.849 --> 08:20.267
Where is your wristband?

08:22.645 --> 08:24.021
Ask him.

08:26.398 --> 08:27.608
How many?

08:27.775 --> 08:30.111
Twenty-four and counting.

08:31.821 --> 08:33.364
You idiots.

08:35.241 --> 08:37.201
Life support on the Ark is failing.

08:37.368 --> 08:39.328
That's why they brought us
down here.

08:39.495 --> 08:41.871
They need to know
the ground is survivable again,

08:42.039 --> 08:44.458
and we need their help
against whoever is out there.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.504
If you take off your wristbands,
you're not just killing them.

08:48.671 --> 08:50.131
You're killing us!

08:53.968 --> 08:55.719
We're stronger than you think.

08:55.886 --> 08:58.556
Don't listen to her.
She's one of the privileged.

08:58.722 --> 09:01.267
If they come down,
she'll have it good.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.185
How many of you can say the same?

09:04.228 --> 09:06.522
We can take care of ourselves.

09:06.689 --> 09:09.733
That wristband on your arm?
It makes you a prisoner.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.027
We are not prisoners anymore!

09:12.194 --> 09:14.238
They say they'll forgive your crimes.

09:14.405 --> 09:17.366
I say you're not criminals!

09:17.533 --> 09:20.828
You're fighters, survivors!

09:20.995 --> 09:23.247
The Grounders should worry about us!

09:23.414 --> 09:25.082
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

09:29.920 --> 09:31.088
What do we do now?

09:31.255 --> 09:32.965
Now we go after Jasper.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.926
Why are you here, Abby?

09:36.093 --> 09:39.013
We both know that you could have
sent an apprentice to do this.

09:42.266 --> 09:45.436
Kane's planning a secret council
meeting to vote on the culling.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.397
I need to know where you stand.

09:48.564 --> 09:49.924
I don't have a vote.
You know that.

09:49.982 --> 09:51.442
They listen to you, Thelonious.

09:51.609 --> 09:53.736
Well, you don't.

09:53.903 --> 09:55.905
I do when you agree with me.

09:57.573 --> 10:01.660
Now, Abby, the CO2 scrubbers
are already failing.

10:01.827 --> 10:05.122
The symptoms of oxygen
deprivation are everywhere,

10:05.289 --> 10:08.083
and worst of all in the children.
They'll die first.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.753
- You don't have to tell me that.
- Obviously I do.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.631
Unless we act
to reduce the population,

10:13.797 --> 10:16.759
everyone on-board this space station
will be dead in four months.

10:16.926 --> 10:19.553
We have acted.
We put a hundred kids on the ground.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.840
We need to give them time...

10:20.930 --> 10:23.140
There are 76 kids on the ground.

10:24.516 --> 10:28.771
Twenty four of them,
including my son, are already dead.

10:28.938 --> 10:31.649
- I don't think so.
- But you have no proof.

10:33.234 --> 10:36.320
Please. Stop.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.994
I understand your need
to have hope for Clarke...

10:45.246 --> 10:49.291
...but I am the Chancellor of the Ark,
and hope isn't enough.

10:50.042 --> 10:53.128
Not when the end of
the human race is at stake.

10:55.631 --> 10:56.799
You wanted to see me?

10:58.759 --> 11:00.511
Hope is everything...

11:02.012 --> 11:05.599
...and the Chancellor that I voted for,
he knew that.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.688
I'm done here.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.870
Stop studying me, Kane.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.129
Who shot me?

11:35.963 --> 11:39.300
Bellamy Blake,
a janitor from Factory Station.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.346
He stowed away on the dropship.
We're still investigating who helped him.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.473
Who benefits most from my death?

11:49.393 --> 11:51.353
If you have something to say,
just say it.

11:54.231 --> 11:57.735
You rushed to execute
the woman who saved my life...

11:58.736 --> 12:01.113
...and if I were dead,
you would be Chancellor now

12:01.280 --> 12:03.657
and Abby wouldn't be here
to oppose you.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.201
I followed the law.
I did my job.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.496
You were the acting Chancellor.

12:11.415 --> 12:15.169
And this job requires more
than simply following the law.

12:15.336 --> 12:18.881
It requires knowing when not to.

12:22.634 --> 12:25.888
I had nothing to do with
the attempt on your life,

12:26.055 --> 12:28.265
but I'm not surprised
that it happened.

12:29.892 --> 12:33.437
You're too weak to do
what now has to be done,

12:33.604 --> 12:35.689
and I'm not the only one
who knows it.

13:03.759 --> 13:05.302
<i>There you are.</i>

13:10.516 --> 13:13.277
When my father said they didn't
leave us anything, he really meant it.

13:20.984 --> 13:22.486
It's just a scratch.

13:22.653 --> 13:24.363
You're making friends fast.

13:25.322 --> 13:27.783
Keep it covered.
It could get infected.

13:29.284 --> 13:30.411
Nice pack.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.663
Yeah, seat belts and insulation.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.140
I also packed part of the parachute,

13:34.164 --> 13:35.767
figured we could use it
to carry out Jasper.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.418
Good. Give it to someone else.

13:38.377 --> 13:40.671
- You're not coming with us.
- My ankle's fine.

13:40.838 --> 13:43.590
It's not your ankle, Wells,
it's you.

13:44.425 --> 13:46.677
You came back for
reinforcements. I'm gonna help.

13:46.844 --> 13:49.847
Clarke, he's right. We need him.

13:50.013 --> 13:51.515
So far, no one else
has volunteered.

13:51.682 --> 13:53.451
I'm sorry, Monty,
but you're not going either.

13:53.475 --> 13:55.394
Like hell I'm not.
Jasper's my best friend.

13:55.561 --> 13:56.687
You're too important.

13:56.854 --> 13:59.254
You were raised on Farm Station
and recruited by engineering.

13:59.356 --> 14:02.151
- So?
- So? Food and communication.

14:02.317 --> 14:04.945
What's up here, is gonna save us all.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.672
You figure out how to talk to the Ark
and I'll bring Jasper back.

14:09.575 --> 14:10.868
Hey. You ready?

14:11.034 --> 14:13.328
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither should any of you.

14:13.495 --> 14:16.415
That spear was thrown with
pinpoint accuracy from 300 feet.

14:16.582 --> 14:19.168
- So what, we let Jasper die?
- That's not gonna happen.

14:20.043 --> 14:21.712
Spacewalker?

14:21.879 --> 14:22.963
What a joke.

14:23.505 --> 14:26.216
You think you're such an adventurer.
You're really just a coward.

14:26.884 --> 14:30.137
It's not an adventure, Clarke,
it's a suicide mission.

14:35.893 --> 14:39.688
Build a wall. Use the fallen trees.
I'll watch out for her.

14:41.899 --> 14:43.233
Jasper looked up to you.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.784
- What the hell was it?
- I don't know.

14:52.951 --> 14:54.828
The others said it
looked like a giant snake.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.075
You could have been killed.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.582
She would have been if Jasper
didn't jump in to pull her out.

14:58.749 --> 15:00.375
You guys leaving?
I'm coming, too.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.169
No, no. No way. Not again.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.963
He's right.
Your leg is just gonna slow us down.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.215
I'm here for you.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.343
- Clarke, what are you doing?
- I hear you have a gun.

15:12.054 --> 15:14.056
Good. Follow me.

15:14.223 --> 15:15.849
And why would I do that?

15:17.935 --> 15:21.104
Because you want them
to follow you,

15:21.271 --> 15:24.733
and right now,
they're thinking only one of us is scared.

15:29.905 --> 15:31.448
Murphy.

15:31.615 --> 15:33.575
Come with me. Atom?

15:34.785 --> 15:36.705
My sister doesn't leave this camp.
Is that clear?

15:36.787 --> 15:38.789
I don't need a babysitter.

15:38.956 --> 15:41.416
Anybody touches her,
they answer to me.

15:43.001 --> 15:44.086
Let's go.

15:46.296 --> 15:47.881
You're staying here.

15:49.299 --> 15:51.134
I'm gonna make your life
a living hell.

15:54.805 --> 15:56.807
Those guys aren't
just bullies, Clarke.

15:56.974 --> 15:58.809
They're dangerous criminals.

15:58.976 --> 16:00.769
I'm counting on it.

16:01.937 --> 16:04.398
Since when are we in the
rescuing business, huh?

16:04.565 --> 16:06.316
The Ark thinks the prince is dead.

16:06.483 --> 16:09.444
Once they think the princess is, too,
they'll never come down.

16:11.822 --> 16:13.657
I'm getting that wristband,

16:13.824 --> 16:15.784
even if I have to cut
off her hand to do it.

16:40.183 --> 16:41.476
<i>Damn it, Raven.</i>

16:42.060 --> 16:43.979
Wait for pressurization.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.860
Sorry, boys.
Places to go.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.531
Did anyone notice there's
no damage to "B" dock?

16:55.032 --> 16:56.426
"B" dock's restricted.
You know that.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.410
What, are they gonna float me
for looking?

16:59.536 --> 17:03.332
Guys, come on.
An Exodus ship was launched.

17:03.498 --> 17:05.166
You're not curious about that?

17:05.334 --> 17:07.794
It was not launched.
It was ejected.

17:07.961 --> 17:08.962
According to engineering,

17:09.128 --> 17:11.339
a routine maintenance accident
forced them to eject.

17:11.506 --> 17:14.468
A maintenance accident
that didn't cause any damage?

17:14.635 --> 17:16.970
That's a lie and you know it.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.932
Fine. Well, if that doesn't
stir your tank, how about this?

17:21.933 --> 17:24.185
Why would they build
a dropship in the first place?

17:24.353 --> 17:26.497
Just slow down, all right?
We need to check your vitals.

17:26.521 --> 17:28.440
I'll save you the trouble.

17:28.607 --> 17:30.567
I feel good.

17:31.193 --> 17:34.446
Prison visiting day. Tell lover boy
I'll pay him the two days' rations

17:34.655 --> 17:35.735
I owe him when he gets out.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.407
It was three days.
Hey, stash my gear.

17:37.574 --> 17:39.701
- I'll come back for it later.
- Okay, Raven, stop.

17:41.453 --> 17:44.081
Lockup's been quarantined.
There's some kind of a virus.

17:44.247 --> 17:47.417
There's no visitation for
at least two months. Sorry.

17:52.506 --> 17:53.924
Hey, I saw that. You cheated.

17:54.091 --> 17:57.344
Hey, guys,
the Wall's not gonna build itself.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.263
Walls won't stop what's out there.
We need weapons.

18:00.430 --> 18:01.765
So build weapons.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.935
Look, your brother wasn't
kidding about that. He'll hurt them.

18:05.102 --> 18:06.895
Come on. We were just talking.

18:07.062 --> 18:08.689
You're too hot
to be my brother's bitch.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.692
- I'm no one's bitch.
- Hmm, good.

18:15.445 --> 18:16.947
Then prove it.

18:19.908 --> 18:21.493
Come with me.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.554
- Hey.
- Get out of here.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.143
Nobody's bitch, huh?

18:49.229 --> 18:52.357
Maybe one of these days
you'll realize you can't control me.

18:53.984 --> 18:55.736
You know that guy you were with?

18:56.695 --> 18:58.321
Did you know he was in for murder?

18:59.781 --> 19:02.581
You want to know something funny?
I'm actually protecting him from you.

19:06.663 --> 19:08.999
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

19:10.167 --> 19:11.668
Consider yourself controlled.

19:11.835 --> 19:12.836
Is this all you got?

19:13.003 --> 19:16.798
They locked me under the floor
for 16 years just for being born!

19:18.008 --> 19:19.134
This is nothing.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.386
You want to keep it down?

19:23.346 --> 19:24.931
I'm trying to concentrate.

19:29.394 --> 19:33.273
<i>Attention. The mess hall
will be closed from 2100 hours</i>

19:33.440 --> 19:35.442
<i>to 0800 hours for maintenance.</i>

19:35.984 --> 19:40.906
<i>Attention. The mess hall will be
closed from 2100 hours...</i>

19:41.072 --> 19:42.365
Abby.

19:43.158 --> 19:44.701
Kane's lobbying for votes.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.078
We should, too.

19:48.705 --> 19:50.373
We'll have our chance
at the briefing.

19:53.376 --> 19:54.836
Excuse me! Dr. Griffin.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.880
I have a question
about the quarantine.

19:57.088 --> 19:59.299
My boyfriend's in lockup.
I went to go see him.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.301
Instead, I saw an open air duct.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.788
Now, if there really was a virus,

20:02.844 --> 20:04.444
wouldn't you move
to contain the airflow?

20:04.513 --> 20:07.557
The virus isn't airborne.
That's why the ducts are open.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.894
Can you tell me if he's okay?

20:11.061 --> 20:12.896
I can't. I'm sorry.

20:14.898 --> 20:16.483
No, you're not.

20:16.608 --> 20:18.652
First the dropship, now this.

20:18.902 --> 20:21.238
The council's hiding something,

20:21.404 --> 20:23.323
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

20:25.367 --> 20:26.868
Ballsy kid.

20:28.245 --> 20:29.663
Yeah.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.957
Reminds me of someone.

20:33.291 --> 20:34.835
Hey, hold up.

20:36.962 --> 20:39.362
What's the rush? You don't survive
a spear through the heart.

20:39.422 --> 20:40.462
Put the gun away, Bellamy.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.133
Why don't you do something about it?

20:42.300 --> 20:44.261
Jasper screamed when they moved him.

20:44.427 --> 20:47.222
If the spear struck his heart,
he'd have died instantly.

20:47.389 --> 20:48.741
It doesn't mean
we have time to waste.

20:48.765 --> 20:51.268
As soon as you take
this wristband off, we can go.

20:53.270 --> 20:56.898
The only way the Ark is gonna
think I'm dead, is if I'm dead.

20:57.065 --> 20:58.441
Got it?

20:59.818 --> 21:01.570
Brave princess.

21:01.736 --> 21:03.530
Hey, why don't you
find your own nickname?

21:04.614 --> 21:06.283
You call this a rescue party?

21:06.449 --> 21:08.201
Got to split up, cover more ground.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.078
Clarke, come with me.

21:11.788 --> 21:13.248
Better late than never.

21:13.415 --> 21:15.125
I like to think so.

21:29.139 --> 21:31.433
Guess we got more
in common than meets the eye, huh?

21:32.726 --> 21:34.185
We have nothing in common.

21:34.352 --> 21:35.645
No?

21:35.812 --> 21:38.356
Both came down here
to protect someone we love.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.277
Your secret's safe with me.

21:42.444 --> 21:44.905
'Course, for you it's worse.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.491
With Finn around,
Clarke doesn't even see you.

21:49.659 --> 21:51.494
It's like you're not even here.

21:55.665 --> 21:59.628
He may not be my real brother,
but he's always been there.

21:59.794 --> 22:02.505
Every memory I have, there's Jasper.

22:05.175 --> 22:06.760
I should be out there.

22:07.719 --> 22:09.471
You're not gonna cry, are you?

22:10.680 --> 22:11.680
Shut up.

22:13.516 --> 22:14.935
You sure about this?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.501
Your brother won't approve of you
helping us contact the Ark.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.189
He's not my keeper.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.233
Let's just do this.
Let's do it.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.117
Ah!

22:32.953 --> 22:35.205
- Ow! Son of a...
- Sorry.

22:39.042 --> 22:40.543
- Dead.
- Oh.

22:40.710 --> 22:41.836
Damn it.

22:42.003 --> 22:44.843
If we can't even take it off,
how do you expect to turn it into a radio?

22:52.722 --> 22:56.309
Go on. I'll be fine.
Work to do.

23:04.067 --> 23:05.694
Hey, Monty?

23:05.860 --> 23:07.988
Jasper would understand
why you stayed.

23:10.657 --> 23:13.952
How is someone raised beneath
the floor not a total basket case?

23:15.078 --> 23:16.621
Who says I'm not?

23:20.417 --> 23:21.501
It's because he loves you.

23:22.544 --> 23:24.087
Your brother?

23:24.254 --> 23:26.256
You're not a basket case
because you were loved.

23:28.299 --> 23:29.551
Yeah, I'm a lucky girl.

23:29.718 --> 23:32.762
I'm not saying I had it worse than you,
Octavia, because I didn't.

23:33.972 --> 23:36.099
But you have someone
who would do anything for you.

23:37.267 --> 23:38.685
I envy that.

23:45.233 --> 23:47.318
I've been thinking
about Mount Weather.

23:47.485 --> 23:50.447
How come they didn't attack
until Jasper crossed the river?

23:50.613 --> 23:53.333
It's not like we were being quiet
and they didn't know we were there.

23:55.493 --> 23:57.203
They waited for us to cross.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.206
The river's a boundary.

24:01.249 --> 24:03.168
Which means Mount Weather
is off limits.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.131
How are we gonna get those supplies?
What are we gonna do for food?

24:21.061 --> 24:22.437
Wow.

24:25.315 --> 24:27.275
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about water.

24:39.871 --> 24:41.372
Oh, yeah.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.506
Come on, Finn.
We don't have time for this.

24:49.672 --> 24:53.176
Clarke, we've been hiking for hours.
We need to take a break.

24:53.343 --> 24:55.178
I'll take a break
when we find Jasper.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.596
Come on.

25:01.184 --> 25:04.062
No, no. Finn! Don't!

25:05.980 --> 25:07.524
Damn it, Finn!

25:11.945 --> 25:14.030
Oh, wow. Okay.

25:15.198 --> 25:17.158
- Maybe just a minute.
- Yeah.

25:21.704 --> 25:24.499
I think I know why
you're so hell-bent on finding Jasper,

25:24.666 --> 25:27.377
why you're always taking
care of everybody else.

25:27.544 --> 25:29.337
Now you sound like my mother.

25:30.130 --> 25:33.716
No. Go on. This should be good.
The delinquent psychiatrist.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.807
You couldn't save your father.

26:16.926 --> 26:18.928
Jasper. He was here.

26:20.138 --> 26:21.764
We should get the others.

26:28.396 --> 26:29.856
We're close.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.615
Abby, we have to stop.

26:38.781 --> 26:40.101
The council vote's in 30 minutes.

26:40.158 --> 26:41.576
Then we have 30 minutes.

26:41.743 --> 26:43.745
- Anything from engineering?
- Nothing good.

26:43.912 --> 26:45.764
According to Sinclair,
even if we sent a signal down,

26:45.788 --> 26:47.433
the wristbands weren't
designed to receive,

26:47.457 --> 26:48.726
so the kids wouldn't even hear it.

26:48.750 --> 26:50.144
There's got to be
something we missed.

26:50.168 --> 26:51.608
Something that
we haven't thought of.

26:52.754 --> 26:54.380
Great. What's falling apart now?

26:58.218 --> 26:59.427
Hey! Hey!

27:04.474 --> 27:06.114
Apparently you have a thing
for air ducts.

27:06.142 --> 27:07.268
I'll call security.

27:08.311 --> 27:09.896
They're not dying.

27:11.814 --> 27:13.358
What are you talking about?

27:16.611 --> 27:18.404
All that's being sent
from the ground?

27:23.701 --> 27:25.328
Transmitted by these.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.126
They're taking them off.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.754
What? Why would they
do something so reckless?

27:35.713 --> 27:37.298
Because we told them not to.

28:05.285 --> 28:06.953
Hello, beautiful.

28:16.045 --> 28:18.006
Hey, where are you going?

29:46.886 --> 29:48.346
It's okay.

29:49.097 --> 29:50.973
We've got nothing but time.

30:03.361 --> 30:05.571
Hey, how do we know
this is the right way?

30:05.738 --> 30:08.366
We don't.
Spacewalker thinks he's a tracker.

30:08.533 --> 30:11.577
It's called "cutting sign."
Fourth-year Earth skills. He's good.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.304
You want to keep it down or should
I paint a target on your back?

30:28.052 --> 30:30.179
See? You're invisible.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.435
What the hell was that?

30:36.144 --> 30:38.187
Now would be a good time
to take out that gun.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.529
Jasper.

30:56.164 --> 30:57.540
- Oh, my God.
- Clarke, be careful.

30:57.707 --> 30:59.041
Jasper?

31:00.460 --> 31:01.794
What the hell is this?

31:04.714 --> 31:06.257
Clarke! Get her up!

31:07.842 --> 31:10.011
Pull her up! Pull her up!
Get her! Pull her up!

31:15.224 --> 31:16.851
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:24.233 --> 31:25.359
We need to get him down.

31:25.526 --> 31:26.962
I'll climb up there
and cut the vines.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.780
- Yeah, I'm with you.
- No. Stay with Clarke.

31:29.947 --> 31:31.574
And watch him.

31:31.741 --> 31:33.159
You. Let's go.

31:34.035 --> 31:35.578
There's a poultice on his wound.

31:36.454 --> 31:38.206
Medicine?
Why would they save his life

31:38.372 --> 31:39.725
just to string him up as live bait?

31:39.749 --> 31:42.186
Maybe what they're trying to catch
likes its dinner to be breathing.

31:42.210 --> 31:43.810
Maybe what they're trying
to catch is us.

31:47.298 --> 31:49.717
<i>Data indicates that the
violent criminals in the group</i>

31:49.842 --> 31:53.221
are eight times more likely
to have terminated signals.

31:53.387 --> 31:56.349
We believe that this means
that the kids

31:56.516 --> 31:59.435
are taking off the wristbands
by choice.

31:59.936 --> 32:01.521
So how do you explain Wells?

32:01.687 --> 32:03.022
Kane is right.

32:03.731 --> 32:08.319
My son would never take
his wristband off voluntarily.

32:09.278 --> 32:12.490
Both our children have done things
that we could never have predicted.

32:13.616 --> 32:16.410
The point holds.
These children need more time.

32:16.577 --> 32:21.165
We don't have time. Engineering needs
six months to fix life support.

32:22.124 --> 32:24.085
And we'll be out of oxygen in four.

32:27.630 --> 32:29.298
Nobody wants to do this,

32:29.465 --> 32:32.385
but the inescapable fact
is that for every day we delay,

32:32.552 --> 32:35.805
ten more people
will need to be sacrificed.

32:35.972 --> 32:38.683
So today it's 209,
tomorrow it's 219.

32:38.849 --> 32:40.977
The day after that is 229.

32:41.143 --> 32:43.312
We're the ones who need more time.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.856
I move that we vote now.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.441
- I second that.
- Very well.

32:47.608 --> 32:50.611
The matter before us requires
a four-vote majority to pass.

32:50.778 --> 32:54.824
A vote in favor is to vote
to cull 209 citizens of the Ark

32:54.991 --> 32:57.326
from the supply grid in
order to extend life support

32:57.493 --> 33:00.162
for those who remain by six months.

33:01.706 --> 33:03.207
All those in favor?

33:04.584 --> 33:06.043
- Aye.
- Aye.

33:07.378 --> 33:08.379
All those opposed?

33:08.546 --> 33:10.423
- Nay.
- Nay.

33:10.590 --> 33:12.133
Three votes to three.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.010
The Chancellor will break the tie.

33:16.971 --> 33:19.181
We didn't ask for this.

33:23.185 --> 33:26.522
Ours was to be
a transitional generation.

33:28.316 --> 33:32.987
Ensuring that three generations
from now mankind could go home.

33:34.071 --> 33:38.826
But everything has changed,
and we will either be the generation

33:38.993 --> 33:43.039
that sees the human race
return to Earth...

33:44.999 --> 33:50.671
...or upon whose watch, it finally ends.

33:53.716 --> 33:55.635
My son is already down there.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.722
I sent him.

34:03.351 --> 34:08.813
And the truth is I don't know
if he is alive or dead.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.235
But I still have hope.

34:15.529 --> 34:17.447
How does the Chancellor vote?

34:21.744 --> 34:22.870
I don't.

34:23.036 --> 34:26.081
Sir, if you abstain,
the vote ends in a tie

34:26.248 --> 34:29.877
to be automatically
taken up again in ten days.

34:30.043 --> 34:31.444
That's ten more dead for every day.

34:31.587 --> 34:34.757
I ask again,
how does the Chancellor vote?

34:34.924 --> 34:36.509
The Chancellor abstains.

34:41.389 --> 34:42.973
You have ten days.

34:50.773 --> 34:52.149
Hurry up, Murphy.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.818
Be careful.

34:56.445 --> 34:57.947
What the hell was that?

34:58.989 --> 35:00.449
Grounders?

35:07.790 --> 35:09.291
Bellamy, gun!

35:40.990 --> 35:42.408
Now she sees you.

35:48.831 --> 35:50.833
Did someone call for a mechanic?

35:55.963 --> 35:57.683
You're the one who
called in the work order?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.759
We need to talk.

36:06.974 --> 36:10.352
Look, I told you I'm not
gonna say anything, okay?

36:10.895 --> 36:13.397
I believe you,
and you're not in trouble.

36:13.898 --> 36:14.982
Follow me.

36:15.149 --> 36:16.734
Not in trouble yet, you mean.

36:18.569 --> 36:20.946
This level's off limits
for people like me.

36:21.113 --> 36:22.323
Not anymore.

36:23.115 --> 36:25.451
You know that we sent
The Hundred down to the ground.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.203
What you don't know is why.

36:28.162 --> 36:29.997
The Ark is dying, Raven.

36:30.164 --> 36:32.666
Life support is on its last legs.

36:33.459 --> 36:37.546
I have ten days to prove
that Earth is survivable

36:37.713 --> 36:39.965
or they're gonna start
reducing population.

36:40.132 --> 36:42.718
320 innocent people will be killed.

36:44.220 --> 36:46.430
I don't get it.
Why are you telling me this?

36:46.597 --> 36:49.725
I looked up your file.
You're the youngest zero-g mechanic

36:49.892 --> 36:51.727
on the Ark in 50 years.

36:52.311 --> 36:55.356
52, but...
So what?

36:55.523 --> 36:57.066
So...

37:02.571 --> 37:05.908
You have nine days to get this ready
so I can survive a drop.

37:12.373 --> 37:14.416
God, what a piece of junk.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.586
They must have found
this thing when they

37:17.753 --> 37:20.589
salvaged MIR-3 in 2102.

37:21.382 --> 37:25.177
You want me to get
a 130-year-old escape pod

37:25.344 --> 37:30.224
ready to stand up to the inferno
of re-entry in nine days?

37:30.391 --> 37:31.892
Can you do it or not?

37:36.856 --> 37:39.692
Hell, yes, I can do it,
but I'm going with you.

37:39.859 --> 37:42.570
You're not the only one with
someone you love on the ground.

37:44.405 --> 37:45.573
Those are my terms.

37:45.906 --> 37:47.867
Take it or leave it.

37:51.203 --> 37:53.247
All right. You can come with me.

37:54.123 --> 37:55.916
You got yourself a mechanic.

38:08.679 --> 38:10.139
<i>They're back!</i>

38:11.765 --> 38:13.058
<i>Over there.</i>

38:16.896 --> 38:18.397
- Is he...?
- He's alive.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.066
I need boiled water and
strips of cloth for bandage.

38:30.159 --> 38:31.911
- Who's hungry?
- Yeah!

38:34.622 --> 38:36.498
Bellamy! Whoo!

39:49.697 --> 39:52.866
He's stable for now,
but without medicine...

39:54.702 --> 39:57.246
They're taking off their
wristbands for food?

39:57.413 --> 39:59.623
No way. I won't do it.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.333
You don't have to.

40:06.714 --> 40:08.424
Whoa. Wait, wait.

40:09.591 --> 40:11.593
What, you think you
play by different rules?

40:12.344 --> 40:13.887
I thought there were no rules.

40:24.106 --> 40:25.441
Hey.

40:36.118 --> 40:37.578
Atom!

40:41.790 --> 40:44.543
Come on.
We're on first watch.

40:52.801 --> 40:54.595
Guys, you're not just gonna
leave me here.

40:54.762 --> 40:57.806
No, Atom.
I won't be disobeyed.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.317
Guys!

41:10.486 --> 41:11.904
Bellamy!

41:12.321 --> 41:14.490
Guys! Bellamy!
