WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.304
Oh, my God.

00:03.337 --> 00:04.372
That was amazing.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.573
I got so loud,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.075
I was worried we'd
wake the kid.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.143
Me, too.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.578
Want to do it again?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.912
So bad.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.215
Okay, here it comes.
Okay.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.819
Mmm, Homeland!

00:18.852 --> 00:21.655
It's so good.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.657
Hey, just popping out
for a quick bike ride.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.559
Really?
Yeah.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.995
You know, catch the night air,
get the blood pumping.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.064
Let these two horses run.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.032
You're gonna ride past
Val's house again, aren't you?

00:32.066 --> 00:33.334
It's not Val's house;
it's our house.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.802
And I will soon be back there.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.738
We're just having
a trial separation.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.707
You do not throw away
an entire marriage

00:39.740 --> 00:42.276
because of one tiny hiccup.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.878
She slept with your
couples therapist, Will.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.281
She said it was
an honest mistake.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.118
How do you sleep
with somebody by mistake?

00:50.151 --> 00:53.921
I accidently sat on
a carrot once, so...

00:55.456 --> 00:56.790
Will, look, you've been
my best friend

00:56.824 --> 00:58.092
since we were 23 years old,
all right?

00:58.126 --> 00:59.293
You're more than welcome

00:59.327 --> 01:00.728
to stay here as long
as you'd like.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.396
Within reason, okay?

01:02.430 --> 01:04.064
But we can't sit back
and watch you

01:04.098 --> 01:05.866
do this to yourself
night after night.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.067
You're right.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.036
I'm being ridiculous.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.138
Screw Val.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.305
Right? I mean...

01:11.339 --> 01:13.474
Dr. Spielman did.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.659
Either turn the TV up
or turn the breast pump down.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.395
I don't even
hear it anymore.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.130
And, you know, the fact
that I'm comfortable enough

01:36.164 --> 01:37.565
to do this in front of you

01:37.598 --> 01:39.733
means you've been living here
a long time.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.769
Wow, that one filled up fast.

01:41.802 --> 01:42.936
Mmm.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.104
What's up with Lefty?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.107
Hey, guys!

01:47.141 --> 01:48.509
Hi, Jules!
Hey, Jules.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.010
Hi.
Oh!

01:50.043 --> 01:51.579
Came straight from the airport.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.746
Aw!
Oh, God.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.416
What's up with Lefty?
Oh...

01:55.449 --> 01:57.585
And, Will, really?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.119
Still with the bicycle stalking?

01:59.153 --> 02:00.421
I...

02:00.454 --> 02:01.655
Sometimes.
Yeah.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.292
How was the yoga retreat?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.659
Oh, amazing.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.195
I met someone.
I'm in love!

02:08.529 --> 02:09.930
And I know what you're thinking:

02:09.963 --> 02:11.465
I say that all the time.
But this time it's real.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.301
And I know I always say,
"This time it's real,"

02:13.334 --> 02:14.635
but this time it's really real.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.871
His name is Lowell,
and he's Australian.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.173
And he owns a restaurant.

02:19.207 --> 02:23.344
And we had sex
for 12 hours straight.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.180
Oh, here's your
sleeping bag.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.849
That is yours now.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.951
So, wanted to stop by

02:30.984 --> 02:32.886
to tell you about the date
I just went on

02:32.920 --> 02:34.222
with your friend
from medical school.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.723
I set her up with
John Koenigsberg.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.025
Oh, yeah, I could
totally see that.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.527
Could you?
Could you see it?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.395
Could you also
see him

02:41.429 --> 02:43.464
bringing his bird to dinner?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.998
Yeah, 'cause he did.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.634
Oh, my God.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.336
That bird is still alive?

02:48.369 --> 02:49.903
And incontinent.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.242
Which was the perfect end
to my perfect day.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.909
Guess what came
in the mail this morning.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
Linda Altman's
wedding invitation?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.780
Can I get through one story
without an interruption?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.983
Linda Altman's
wedding invitation.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.585
So, it is official.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.019
Of our entire sorority,

03:06.053 --> 03:07.921
including the girl
who was such an alcoholic

03:07.955 --> 03:10.791
she defecated in the closet...

03:12.059 --> 03:14.027
...Jules and I are
the only single ones left.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.429
Well, actually...

03:15.463 --> 03:17.465
Oops, still talking.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.234
You know what I think, Kate?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
I think you need
to cast a wider net.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.937
What is that supposed to mean?

03:23.971 --> 03:26.106
Well, just that you're still
looking for the same dude

03:26.139 --> 03:28.208
you were looking for
when you were in your 20s.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.378
Yeah?

03:30.411 --> 03:31.879
Now you're older.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.453
Yeah?
I just...

03:39.487 --> 03:41.789
I think you should be
a little, you know,

03:41.822 --> 03:43.724
less picky.
Picky?

03:43.757 --> 03:44.892
Little less superficial.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.760
Okay, I am not superficial.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.297
What?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.699
Bald.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.100
Hairy.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.201
Tank top.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.337
Guys, his wiener smells weird.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.572
Birthmark.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.774
Red hair.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.243
Everywhere.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.412
One ball.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.615
One big ball.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.950
So, there are a few things
that bother me.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.619
You know, besides,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.754
the main reason it didn't work
out with any of those guys

04:13.787 --> 04:15.389
was because they weren't nice.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.890
Are you seriously
gonna sit there

04:16.924 --> 04:19.226
and tell me you're just
looking for a nice guy?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.894
Yes, because I am.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.996
Really?
Really.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.633
Well, you're in luck, then.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.100
My friend from high school,
Jimmy Benina,

04:27.134 --> 04:28.268
just moved to L.A.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.837
Normal hair, normal hands.

04:29.870 --> 04:33.106
I've never smelled his wiener,
but super nice guy.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.210
Why don't I set you up?

04:38.346 --> 04:39.313
That'd be great.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.281
Great.
Great.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.352
All right, so the guy
with the one ball,

04:44.385 --> 04:46.987
was it in the middle
or on the side?

04:48.456 --> 04:50.624
It was right in the middle.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.025
Just coming at me

04:52.059 --> 04:54.528
like the boulder
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.944
Hi. I'm...

05:10.978 --> 05:12.946
Susan?

05:12.980 --> 05:13.981
No.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.683
Oh, thank God.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.018
Hi. Jimmy?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.453
Kate?

05:19.487 --> 05:23.056
Yes. Oh, so glad
I'm not Susan right now.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.226
Susan is totally
going home in a trunk.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.165
He owns this place?
Mm-hmm.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.701
You know there's no meat
anywhere on this menu?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.136
What's cashew cheese?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.238
It's cheese made from cashews.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.507
Cheese comes from milk.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.142
How do you milk nuts?

05:42.175 --> 05:45.212
It's not cheese cheese;
it's nut cheese.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.847
You can make
anything out of nuts.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.315
You can make anything
out of Play-Doh.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.850
Doesn't mean I
want to eat it.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.152
Hey, beautiful.
Here he comes.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.422
I have missed you.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.367
You must be Andi.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.902
Jules has told me

06:08.936 --> 06:10.838
all about your adventures
at university.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.841
So handsome.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.042
Namaste, man. Namaste.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.109
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.911
Get in here, mate.
Ooh!

06:17.945 --> 06:19.346
Good to see you, man.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.914
Good to see you.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.783
Hey, man.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.389
So, Bobby's worried he's
not gonna like anything.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.958
That's a...
Did I say that?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.093
Eh, do you like
eating animals, Bob?

06:33.126 --> 06:37.030
Only ones that
fit between buns.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.567
You know, you should visit
a slaughterhouse sometime.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.869
You can hear
the animals screaming.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.205
I know, but bacon, come on.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.375
All right, so, uh, tell us
about yourself, Lowell.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.911
Okay, well, uh,
I'm a Buddhist.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.213
Uh, I practice
transcendental meditation.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.882
You know, I cook, I surf,

06:54.915 --> 06:57.918
I sing, I garden...

06:57.951 --> 07:00.020
I love.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.790
But what about you guys?
Tell me about you guys.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.225
Well, I'm an ob-gyn.
Uh-huh.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.994
I have a private practice
with my friend Will.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.995
Mm.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.466
We have a son Charlie.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.771
We love Homeland.
Yeah.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.939
What's that?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.407
It's a TV show.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.109
Oh, I don't have
a telly, mate.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.077
You don't have a TV?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.312
What do you do
after work?

07:25.345 --> 07:27.981
Uh, well,
last night, for example,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.316
I, uh...

07:29.349 --> 07:32.285
crafted Jules this necklace.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.821
It's, uh,

07:33.854 --> 07:37.491
made from the grains of sand
that you were standing on

07:37.525 --> 07:39.527
when I saw you
for the first time.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.596
I remember
the sun was setting

07:42.630 --> 07:45.833
and the water was
as blue as your eyes.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.468
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh!

07:48.502 --> 07:49.637
So sorry.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.771
It's fine.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.972
We met at a bar
that burned down

07:52.005 --> 07:54.007
in an insurance fire.
Mm-hmm.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.343
Wasn't a whole lot left
to make a necklace.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.678
So, you know.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.848
So, how long
have you guys been married?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.149
Oh...

08:02.182 --> 08:03.951
like, oh, seven years.
Uh, mm-hmm.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.786
Mm-hmm, September 14, yeah.
Yeah.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.521
Today's September 14.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.857
No, no, it's not
September 14.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.358
That would mean
it's our anniversary.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.226
Oh, my God,
it's our anniversary.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.528
Oh, my God.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.896
Well, we need to celebrate.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.130
Yes, we do.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.967
Nut cheese
for everyone!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.336
So, how are you
still single?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.238
I think men are
intimidated by me.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.207
Oh, oh, really?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.543
What's so, uh, intimidating?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.912
Well, I went
to Harvard Business School.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.514
I own the hottest social media
company in the country.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.516
I haven't cried since 1987.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.289
And I'm phenomenal in bed.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.425
Why are we still here?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.705
I can't believe we forgot
our anniversary.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.106
Okay, let's
not overreact.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.574
You know who
we're turning into?

09:00.608 --> 09:01.842
That sad couple in Ohio

09:01.875 --> 09:03.276
who just sat around
in their sweatpants

09:03.310 --> 09:05.613
and watched TV
and hated each other all day.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.380
My parents?
Yes!

09:07.414 --> 09:09.016
If I may,

09:09.049 --> 09:10.217
let's go deeper.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.785
How often do you make love?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.453
I... I...
Oh.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.554
Excuse me?

09:14.588 --> 09:15.856
That's pretty, uh...

09:15.889 --> 09:17.224
Yeah, that's-that's...
I don't know, why?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.927
How often do you,
uh... make love?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.094
I mean, not often,
you know.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.529
Four or five times a week.
Yeah.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.066
But my darling Jules
pleasures me every day.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.369
Every day?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.038
Why?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.807
Because he likes it,
and so do I.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.343
What is there to like?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.647
Like, all the days?

09:39.680 --> 09:42.049
Okay... I think that we're
getting sidetracked here.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.551
The point is...
Monday, Tuesday

09:44.584 --> 09:46.654
and Wednesday?
All the days?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.288
How often do you, Andi?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.891
Less.
Never!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.059
Well, don't you
miss it, Bob?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.594
I do now, very much, yes.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.805
Now, I promise you I will
never forget an anniversary.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.439
You know, it's been...
Six weeks.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.474
Two days.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.509
Four hours.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.411
And five minutes.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.980
My watch is fast
by five minutes.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.282
I know. I accounted
for that.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.585
God, I love you.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.687
I love you.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.854
I want you all the time.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.155
I want you all the time.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.858
Let's get married.
Okay!

10:24.892 --> 10:26.359
Sorry, did we just...?

10:32.199 --> 10:34.501
Listen to this.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.903
It's not playing.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.638
It's not playing.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.374
It's not playing.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.442
Val called.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.510
Val?
Yeah.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.178
She said she needs
to see me.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.479
Needs to see me.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.015
I think we both know
what that means.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.683
She's coming over
our house tonight.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.551
Yeah. I don't know
what's more surprising,

10:51.584 --> 10:55.689
the fact that she's coming over
or you call it "our house."

10:55.723 --> 10:59.459
Joke all you want,
but my wife is back, baby!

10:59.492 --> 11:01.194
Everything's coming together
for me.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.131
Yeah, well, I wish I could say
the same for me and Andi.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.498
I forgot our
anniversary.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.034
Now she thinks we're in a rut.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.635
I mean, I don't even have
an anniversary present.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.470
What'd you get her last year?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.572
Breast pump.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.007
Yeah, you need to step it up.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.342
Hey.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.744
How about instead
of getting her a gift,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.311
you throw her a party?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.547
Andi's always taking care
of everybody else, right?

11:20.580 --> 11:22.750
It'd be nice for her to be
the guest of honor for a change.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.184
That's a great idea.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.986
I'll throw her
a surprise party... tonight.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.755
I'll send her out
for a massage,

11:27.788 --> 11:30.891
she comes back,
surprise, no more rut.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.692
All right, great,
I think I got Val's message.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.694
Still not playing.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.032
Kate, what are you doing here?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.869
I just came by to tell you
what a wonderful date I had.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.104
Thank you
for setting us up.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.340
So there's nothing
you didn't like?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.743
Not even... a little?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.584
Nope.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.353
Really? 'Cause Jimmy said
you, uh...

12:00.387 --> 12:03.623
you cut the evening short.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.259
I was not feeling well,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.928
but that was no reflection
on Jimmy.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.196
It was a great date.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.432
Mostly... small talk?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.236
I had a lovely time.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.305
Huh. 'Cause I-I thought
you might have had

12:18.338 --> 12:19.873
a problem with his height.

12:19.907 --> 12:23.143
His height? I'm sure
I don't know what you mean.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.611
Really?

12:24.644 --> 12:25.578
Really.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.080
Really?
Really.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.081
Really?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.382
Really.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.852
Happily, I have a pap smear
to get to.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.437
What is happening?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.339
What am I watching?

12:52.372 --> 12:53.974
So what you're saying
is that you may

12:54.007 --> 12:56.276
or you may not
be engaged?
Exactly.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.510
He asked the question,

12:57.544 --> 12:58.979
and then we had sex
and fell asleep.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.247
And when we woke up
this morning,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.514
we didn't even
talk about it.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.950
I mean, when you
proposed to Andi,

13:02.983 --> 13:04.117
did she know
you proposed?

13:04.151 --> 13:06.920
She was in the loop, yeah.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.959
Ugh! If I wanted to hear
an idiot playing guitar,

13:11.992 --> 13:14.828
I'd still be dating John Mayer.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.763
Who is that?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.967
Is that girl wearing
the same dress as you?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.170
Ah, Kate. Great news.
Jimmy's here.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.537
Oh?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.273
Yeah, I invited him.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.041
I thought you'd be happy,
given how much you liked him.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.110
I am happy.
Yeah?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.979
Thank you so much
for thinking of me.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.148
Ooh, jicama.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.152
Why aren't you
saying hi?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.124
There is no logical reason.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.125
Jimmy, hi.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.393
Hi, Kate.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.161
No, don't get up.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.165
I'll just sit down
next to you

13:52.199 --> 13:53.901
like lovers do.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.302
You know, Jimmy,
Kate was just telling me

13:55.335 --> 13:56.403
how much she
likes you.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.905
I do.
I like you so much.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.974
I like you so much, Kate.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.543
Well, dude, thanks
for hooking us up.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.412
Yes, Will, thank you.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.080
Admit it.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.349
Never.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.258
Everything is so small.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.893
Fine. I'm superficial.
You win.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.594
I'm out.
I can't do it.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.166
You know, I'm surprised
you, uh, even set us up.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.035
I used to be such a jerk
in high school.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.069
I thought you hated me.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.439
I do.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.410
Okay, Andi's here.
Everyone back up, stay quiet

14:37.444 --> 14:38.845
until the lights come on.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.747
Shh!

14:46.286 --> 14:48.121
Honey?

14:48.155 --> 14:49.856
Yeah. Let me
get the lights.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.558
Oh, no-no-no-no-no,
don't get the lights.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.294
Trust me. It's sexier
this way. Come here.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.395
No, I should really...

14:55.428 --> 14:56.696
No-no-no.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.432
Oh! Oh. Oh...

14:59.466 --> 15:01.601
Why are we in the dark?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.077
Surprise.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.550
How long were you gonna
let me go on for?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.219
You know me.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.254
A minute.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.633
I need to know
what's going on here,

15:33.666 --> 15:37.004
because I distinctly heard
you say, "Let's get married."

15:37.037 --> 15:39.006
And it's okay if it
just slipped out,

15:39.039 --> 15:42.309
but I just need to know
whether we are or we aren't...

15:42.342 --> 15:44.677
getting married.
Okay.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.983
Okay, the truth is...

15:50.017 --> 15:51.751
I didn't mean to propose.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.820
No.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.789
Obviously. I mean, I knew that.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.294
They have such
nice hand towels.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.496
No, no, babe... babe,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.765
I didn't mean to propose

16:05.798 --> 16:08.435
'cause I didn't want it
to happen like that.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.437
My best decisions
aren't the ones

16:10.470 --> 16:12.939
I've thought about
for a long time.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.375
They're the ones
I've made from my heart.

16:21.681 --> 16:25.352
Jules Talley...

16:25.385 --> 16:26.819
will you marry me?

16:26.853 --> 16:29.789
Yes!

16:29.822 --> 16:32.425
Is it made of sand?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.462
No. Conflict-free diamond.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.332
Oh, my God,
I'm getting married!

16:42.102 --> 16:43.736
All right, I'm trying
to get her to come down,

16:43.770 --> 16:45.538
but that was
obviously very humiliating,

16:45.572 --> 16:47.740
so it would be nice if we could
refrain from making jokes.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.243
That's gonna be really hard
for me.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.413
Honey, you're making too
big a deal out of this.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.582
It's no worse than when
your boob popped out

16:55.615 --> 16:57.617
at my cousin's
Bar Mitzvah.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.854
Come on. It's just us.
Come downstairs.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.557
Yeah, head down.

17:04.591 --> 17:05.992
Will!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

17:06.025 --> 17:08.161
Sorry. It's out
of my system now, I swear.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.363
I swear.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.031
Totally blown over.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.172
Honey, I know I said this
through the bedroom door,

17:19.206 --> 17:21.708
through the bathroom door,

17:21.741 --> 17:23.210
through the closet door.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.878
I really am sorry.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.046
Especially for
grabbing you

17:27.080 --> 17:28.548
by the back of your head
like that.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.250
But that was just reflex.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.685
It's fine.
When I was curled up

17:32.719 --> 17:34.354
in a ball on the floor

17:34.387 --> 17:36.556
trying to forget the look
on our pediatrician's face,

17:36.589 --> 17:39.226
I, uh... I did
a lot of thinking.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.262
We both tried
to help the marriage.

17:42.295 --> 17:45.598
Thank you for the massage
and the party.

17:45.632 --> 17:49.202
And thank you for your...
efforts.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.703
Mm, mm.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.539
We just have to face the fact

17:52.572 --> 17:55.074
that this is where
we are right now.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.144
It's not exciting,
it's not romantic.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.078
It just is what it is.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.581
Val's here.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.816
Val's here! Val's here!

18:06.819 --> 18:08.455
Oh, hey, Val.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.589
Hi, Will.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.391
Oh.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.293
Can we talk alone?

18:13.326 --> 18:16.629
Uh, no. No, I-I'd like
to share this with everybody,

18:16.663 --> 18:18.831
'cause I have been
surrounded by doubters.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.900
Those who said that this
moment would never happen.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.001
Like you two,

18:22.034 --> 18:23.270
who said
that I needed

18:23.303 --> 18:24.837
to "face facts."

18:24.871 --> 18:26.573
And Kate, ever the
cynic, who said

18:26.606 --> 18:27.774
that "marriage
is a bitch."

18:27.807 --> 18:30.177
No, I said you married a bitch.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.015
Listen, I'm not
gonna lie.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.917
You've got some
making up to do.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.819
But know that,
in the end,

18:39.852 --> 18:41.454
we both want
the same thing:

18:41.488 --> 18:43.490
a stronger us.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.492
I want a divorce, Will.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.594
No, I said
"a stronger us."

18:47.627 --> 18:48.928
Here are the papers.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.697
I tried to give them
to you last night,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.499
but you rode by so quickly.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.369
I would stay longer,
but this feels like

18:56.403 --> 18:58.538
a "rip the Band-Aid off"
kind of moment.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.507
So...

19:05.678 --> 19:07.247
No!

19:08.848 --> 19:10.983
Oh, God, why are you still here?

19:11.017 --> 19:15.222
Bobby, can you please
pay this man so he will leave?

19:15.255 --> 19:19.559
He is my fiancé.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.495
I'm... I'm sorry. What?

19:23.863 --> 19:24.997
You're engaged?

19:25.031 --> 19:27.066
Yes!

19:27.099 --> 19:28.801
Yes, we are.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.070
And I am incredibly happy.
Please don't be mad.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.006
Mad?

19:34.040 --> 19:37.210
No. That is...

19:37.244 --> 19:41.481
I have some questions,
but that is great news.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.183
I am so happy for you.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.919
Are you crying?

19:46.953 --> 19:47.920
No.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.389
You are!
You are crying!

19:49.422 --> 19:50.923
No, I am not.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.261
This is just my body's
very unexplainable reaction

19:54.294 --> 19:58.030
to how happy I am for you.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.666
Really?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.000
Absolutely.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.503
So I am the only single one.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.738
That is fine.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.777
You're not the only one.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.013
Hey, guys,

20:14.046 --> 20:15.515
my marriage is over.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.716
We know.
Duh.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.050
Clearly.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.387
I've been fighting it
and fighting it,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.255
but you know what?
When I really think about it,

20:22.289 --> 20:25.692
what Val and I had...
it wasn't a marriage.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.859
What you guys have

20:26.893 --> 20:28.628
is a marriage.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.263
And I've been living here
for four weeks.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.399
Six weeks.
Six weeks.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.600
I've seen firsthand

20:33.633 --> 20:35.702
what an amazing couple
you guys are.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.371
You got
an incredible kid.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.539
You support each other.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.907
And you guys
are solid.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.208
If you're in a rut,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.911
God, I want to be
in that rut someday.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.748
You okay?

20:48.781 --> 20:50.383
I will be.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.753
Well, I guess we'll all
remember this anniversary.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.555
Yeah, it's the day
my marriage ended.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.890
The day we got
engaged.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.692
The day I lost to Will.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.462
And the day I performed

21:02.495 --> 21:05.332
a live sex act in front
of everyone we know.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.368
