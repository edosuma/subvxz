00:07.410 --> 00:11.480
They say when you die,
you see a bright light.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.895
The night I died...

00:24.975 --> 00:27.178
I didn't see that light.

00:45.021 --> 00:47.257
All I felt was terror.

00:49.709 --> 00:51.880
A child was killed.

00:54.798 --> 00:56.120
Crash cart, now.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.123
And in my twenty minutes of death,
my world was darkness.

01:00.203 --> 01:02.201
And horror.

01:03.207 --> 01:04.843
Clear.

01:11.618 --> 01:14.088
And then, it was over.

01:17.491 --> 01:19.995
People told me how lucky I was.

01:22.096 --> 01:24.727
That it was a miracle I survived.

01:27.068 --> 01:29.304
But I didn't feel lucky.

01:30.641 --> 01:34.723
When I was brought back, I wasn't alone...

01:36.547 --> 01:39.018
something came with me.

02:32.092 --> 02:34.187
Hey, Scotty.

02:34.575 --> 02:38.654
What's up? Hi.
Where'd all the bad people go?

02:42.710 --> 02:45.659
Come out, guys, I know you're there.

02:48.432 --> 02:50.851
Fine. I'm going in.

02:50.935 --> 02:52.592
Hey.

02:54.205 --> 02:56.260
You guys suck.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.897
Sorry, Cass. It was his idea.

02:59.077 --> 03:02.734
Here's a welcome back to the world
present to make it up to you.

03:02.814 --> 03:05.024
Apology accepted.

03:07.738 --> 03:09.961
That's our girl.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.832
So... Cassie Stevens.

03:12.912 --> 03:15.217
The girl who cheated death.

03:15.297 --> 03:17.052
How's it feel?

03:17.132 --> 03:19.542
Better than not cheating it.

03:20.102 --> 03:22.178
Amen to that.

03:22.906 --> 03:24.959
Here's a toast.

03:25.700 --> 03:29.209
To tasting death, and then beating it.

03:33.921 --> 03:38.735
Then shall come to pass as is written...

03:39.215 --> 03:43.893
death shall be swallowed up in victory.

03:45.152 --> 03:48.520
And with this promise of victory...

03:48.600 --> 03:51.838
we now commend the soul of Katie...

03:52.318 --> 03:56.244
unto the loving hands of our Lord.

03:58.224 --> 04:02.992
Eternal rest, grant her, oh, Lord.

04:03.072 --> 04:06.524
And may perpetual light...

04:06.604 --> 04:09.477
shine upon her.

04:13.113 --> 04:16.168
May she rest in peace.

04:20.574 --> 04:22.306
Amen.

04:23.944 --> 04:26.178
Then the devil approached him and said...

04:27.258 --> 04:31.907
if you are the Son of God,
command that these stones become bread.

04:31.987 --> 04:33.913
Jesus said in reply...

04:33.993 --> 04:37.488
it is written, that man
does not live by bread alone...

04:37.698 --> 04:40.779
but by every word that comes
from the mouth of God.

04:41.453 --> 04:43.879
Steve, you have something you want to add?

04:44.269 --> 04:47.762
Yeah, well, what about the parts
in the Bible that mention the devil?

04:47.842 --> 04:50.915
Like when Jesus casts
the demons out of people?

04:51.295 --> 04:55.424
That's obviously how people
at that time understood mental illness.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.883
Today we'd consider that, schizophrenia.

05:00.119 --> 05:01.843
Cassie?

05:04.241 --> 05:05.978
Cassie?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.536
Yeah?

05:08.616 --> 05:10.519
Everything okay?

05:11.291 --> 05:12.823
No.

05:12.903 --> 05:14.404
Freak.

05:16.247 --> 05:19.327
Okay. We'll pick up
where we left off on Wednesday.

05:19.407 --> 05:21.957
Be sure to finish the reading
of the chapter. Alright?

05:42.237 --> 05:45.026
Hey. You got a second?

05:45.106 --> 05:47.038
Not really.

05:47.118 --> 05:48.964
What's up?

05:49.244 --> 05:52.821
It's just... you look like
this guy I used to know.

05:53.415 --> 05:56.342
- We used to hang out a lot.
- Sorry. It's been pretty crazy.

05:56.422 --> 06:00.641
Yeah, well, if you see the old Justin...

06:00.721 --> 06:03.368
can you give him this.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.737
- This was us?
- Yeah.

06:11.817 --> 06:15.950
Back in like third grade.
My mom found it in this scrapbook.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.154
Man.

06:22.751 --> 06:27.117
Well, let the old Justin
know I miss hanging.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.104
- Cassie.
- Yeah?

06:36.607 --> 06:40.990
I'm glad you're alright.
From the accident and all that.

06:44.042 --> 06:47.319
Yo, J. What you doin', man?
We're gonna be late.

06:48.849 --> 06:50.604
Gotta go.

06:50.684 --> 06:52.394
Yeah.

06:54.554 --> 06:56.712
- So what was that about?
- What was what about?

06:56.892 --> 07:00.821
- Don't give me that. You know that chick?
- Sort of. What about her?

07:00.901 --> 07:03.582
That chick's just weird. I heard she
and her friends killed some girl.

07:03.606 --> 07:05.466
- She wasn't driving.
- Who the hell cares?

07:05.546 --> 07:08.397
- That's still some messed up shit.
- And you wanna be friends with that?

07:08.421 --> 07:11.359
I didn't say we were friends.
She just needed some notes.

07:11.439 --> 07:13.641
Whatever, man.
She's not someone I wanna hang with.

07:13.721 --> 07:16.980
- We're not hanging. It was just notes.
- So did you give them to her?

07:17.510 --> 07:21.507
- No.
- Good. Let's get out of here.

07:32.343 --> 07:35.794
So, are you gonna tell us where
we're going, or do you even know?

07:35.874 --> 07:38.334
I'll keep you guessing, dipshit.

07:41.112 --> 07:44.134
Here we are... Katie Dunne.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.972
Why this one?

07:47.652 --> 07:50.210
'Cause she's the girl we killed.

07:50.999 --> 07:53.489
Pretty screwed up, isn't it?

07:53.569 --> 07:56.227
We're up here, and she's down there.

07:57.088 --> 07:59.679
God really got this one
ass backwards, didn't He.

07:59.759 --> 08:02.421
That's 'cause there is no God.
It's all a bunch of crap.

08:02.501 --> 08:04.675
Yeah. I agree.

08:04.755 --> 08:08.981
What about you, Cass?
Do you believe in a covetous God?

08:09.561 --> 08:13.354
I thought we came here to get drunk.
Not talk about God.

08:13.434 --> 08:16.685
You really think your God
would want you getting drunk?

08:17.175 --> 08:20.915
You know, I think most of the time
He's forgotten about me.

08:21.725 --> 08:24.262
That's because it's all
a fairy tale, Cass.

08:24.342 --> 08:26.839
Nobody's up there to forget.

08:26.919 --> 08:29.477
No God, no devil.

08:30.629 --> 08:32.980
Just life, and then a bunch
of rotting bones.

08:33.059 --> 08:37.097
- Let's just drop it.
- Why, Cass? What are you afraid of?

08:37.178 --> 08:40.533
Nothing.
I just don't want to talk about it.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.997
I think our little Cassie's
scared of death.

08:45.369 --> 08:49.801
So what is it, Cass?
Those fairy tales making you sleep better?

08:49.881 --> 08:51.979
Not really.

08:53.529 --> 08:55.688
There you have it.

09:03.761 --> 09:05.704
Did you guys see that?

09:05.784 --> 09:08.957
- See what?
- A guy just over there.

09:16.163 --> 09:19.230
We probably shouldn't be in here.

09:19.310 --> 09:21.239
Why not?

09:21.535 --> 09:25.307
Hey. We're looking for a ghost
Cassie's been seeing.

09:26.916 --> 09:29.596
Hey, any of you dead people
seen a ghost around here.

09:29.676 --> 09:33.685
- Would you cut the crap?
- I'm not crapping, I'm ghost hunting.

09:33.765 --> 09:35.818
It's not a ghost.

09:35.898 --> 09:39.840
You sure about that, Cass?
You don't sound very convincing.

09:45.122 --> 09:48.096
- What is it?
- I heard something.

09:48.176 --> 09:50.902
Sure it wasn't that ghost
you don't believe in?

10:06.016 --> 10:09.392
You guys, seriously. Come over here.

10:09.853 --> 10:12.059
I hear something.

10:12.139 --> 10:14.061
You guys?

10:18.402 --> 10:20.517
What the hell?

10:43.092 --> 10:44.607
Mom?

11:12.527 --> 11:14.129
Mom?

11:19.735 --> 11:21.414
Dad?

12:27.315 --> 12:28.974
Mom?

12:33.455 --> 12:35.116
Ma?

12:36.726 --> 12:38.363
Dad?

14:43.775 --> 14:48.409
- You wanted to see me, father?
- Yes, Doug. Please. Come in.

14:48.489 --> 14:50.988
Several of the parents called this week.

14:51.068 --> 14:56.403
They said you told the students,
that demons do not exist.

14:56.483 --> 15:00.234
Actually, I explained that the Bible
uses them as metaphors.

15:00.314 --> 15:02.670
Not something to be taken literally.

15:03.866 --> 15:07.171
- Is that what you believe?
- It's what I was taught.

15:07.251 --> 15:09.393
Well, you were taught wrong.

15:09.473 --> 15:12.046
Demons are very real, Doug.

15:12.826 --> 15:17.589
And their actions have
a direct affect on us, as humans.

15:18.416 --> 15:21.073
- What kind of affect?
- Well, it varies.

15:21.953 --> 15:25.709
For some it's oppression,
others obsession.

15:27.383 --> 15:29.640
But ultimately...

15:29.720 --> 15:32.637
their goal is complete domination...

15:32.717 --> 15:35.579
of their will
over that of the individuals.

15:35.659 --> 15:38.120
That's what we call possession.

15:43.946 --> 15:46.021
Ready, guys?

15:48.318 --> 15:50.191
I guess.

15:50.803 --> 15:53.630
Try it with a little less enthusiasm.

15:54.424 --> 15:56.133
I'm ready.

15:56.213 --> 15:59.351
Are you sure, Cass?
We don't have to do this.

15:59.431 --> 16:01.439
I'm sure.

16:02.268 --> 16:04.491
Madame Trish, you may proceed.

16:04.571 --> 16:06.359
Okay.

16:10.276 --> 16:12.154
Okay.

16:12.234 --> 16:14.821
Everyone take a deep breath.

16:15.651 --> 16:18.114
And let it out slowly.

16:21.958 --> 16:26.403
We're gathered here tonight to contact the
entity that's been dwelling in Cassie's home.

16:26.763 --> 16:30.007
Quiet. Go on.

16:30.668 --> 16:34.527
If you're here, spirit,
speak to us now. We command it.

16:34.607 --> 16:36.194
Yeah. Speak, dammit.

16:36.274 --> 16:39.817
Okay. This is not gonna work
unless you're serious.

16:40.279 --> 16:42.034
Sorry.

16:43.028 --> 16:47.475
Speak to us,
oh, spirit from the great beyond.

16:57.633 --> 17:00.189
I don't think it's working.

17:00.669 --> 17:02.898
No, you think.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.500
If you're here, spirit, speak to us now.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.888
Tell us what you want.

17:16.387 --> 17:21.189
- Come on, Seth.
- Okay. Okay, I'll be serious.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.973
What do you want from Cassie, spirit?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.601
He's here.

17:37.647 --> 17:40.039
Speak to us, spirit.

17:40.919 --> 17:43.194
We command it.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.774
It wasn't me.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.752
D. It's on D.

18:14.156 --> 18:17.166
E. D-E.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.998
A. D-E-A.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.514
Dea?

18:30.408 --> 18:32.452
I heard something.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.459
You guys, look.

18:39.832 --> 18:42.203
D. Dead.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.233
It wants you dead.

18:45.661 --> 18:47.617
Holy shit.

18:47.697 --> 18:50.885
That's not even funny. Did you do that?

18:50.965 --> 18:53.208
Hell no.

18:55.807 --> 18:58.094
You guys, I just saw something
outside the window.

18:58.374 --> 19:01.832
- Cass, we're on the second floor.
- I don't care, I just saw something.

19:01.912 --> 19:04.234
Go. Go on, check it out.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.639
You check it out. I'm out of here.

19:07.686 --> 19:10.978
- Just tell me, did you do it?
- No, Cass. I didn't do it.

19:11.058 --> 19:13.042
Seth, wait.

19:16.863 --> 19:19.957
Tell me! Seth!

19:22.968 --> 19:25.614
- Just tell me. Did you do it?
- No, Cass. I didn't.

19:25.974 --> 19:30.066
Seth, wait.
I'm sure it's gonna be fine, girl.

19:30.146 --> 19:33.248
I'm not. I'll see ya, Cass.

19:34.551 --> 19:37.072
- Do you think he did it?
- I don't know.

19:37.152 --> 19:40.943
I felt something.
I'll see you tomorrow, girl.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.153
- Cassie?
- Cassie?

21:16.233 --> 21:18.942
- Cassie, honey.
- Cassie?

21:23.581 --> 21:27.004
And it's been that way,
ever since the crash.

21:27.084 --> 21:30.061
It's like he's just waiting.

21:31.521 --> 21:34.199
What do you think
he's waiting for, Cassie?

21:37.228 --> 21:39.804
For me to kill myself.

21:41.134 --> 21:46.079
Well, then it's our job to see to it
that he doesn't get that pleasure.

21:47.274 --> 21:49.605
You don't think he's real, do you?

21:49.685 --> 21:52.388
You think I'm imagining all of this.

21:53.616 --> 21:58.484
Cassie, I have absolutely no doubt that
you believe what you're seeing is real.

21:58.964 --> 22:01.752
If you're asking me
if I believe in ghosts...

22:01.832 --> 22:05.702
the answer is... I don't know.

22:07.530 --> 22:10.755
What if I told you
there's other people seeing him.

22:11.235 --> 22:13.678
Would you believe me then?

22:20.314 --> 22:23.090
I found this on the Internet.

22:26.087 --> 22:28.142
This is what you've been seeing?

22:28.222 --> 22:30.833
And what other people have been seeing.

22:35.663 --> 22:39.303
I'm certain these visions
are quite terrifying.

22:39.983 --> 22:43.972
My immediate concern
is the effect they're having on you.

22:44.352 --> 22:47.586
Why you think this man
wants you to kill yourself.

22:50.682 --> 22:53.093
Because that's what he does.

24:00.331 --> 24:02.066
Father?

24:02.730 --> 24:05.024
The office told me I could find you here.

24:05.104 --> 24:07.998
- Can we talk?
- Sure, Maggie.

24:08.878 --> 24:10.849
How are you?

24:11.979 --> 24:14.053
It's been hard.

24:15.081 --> 24:17.824
I can't even begin to imagine.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.178
Well, I guess you heard
they're not filing charges in the crash.

24:22.258 --> 24:25.176
- No. I hadn't heard.
- Well, they're not.

24:25.956 --> 24:30.038
So that means my daughter's dead,
and no one's being punished for it.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.951
I'm sorry, Maggie.

24:33.031 --> 24:35.020
Is that what you came to talk about?

24:37.507 --> 24:41.133
I understand that Cassie Stevens
is a student at this school.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.622
Can you help me find her?

24:44.184 --> 24:47.240
I don't see how that's gonna help things.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.623
Well, it will.

24:50.503 --> 24:53.723
That girl has put me through hell.

24:55.510 --> 24:59.928
Katie was all that I had,
and that girl took her from me.

25:01.654 --> 25:05.000
I want her to know
that I wish she died instead.

25:10.548 --> 25:15.065
Hard alcohol anymore, I had too many
bad experiences since junior high...

25:15.145 --> 25:17.832
Junior high? Are you serious?
How old were you?

25:17.912 --> 25:20.440
- I'm only on beer now.
- Hey, can I ask you a favor?

25:20.720 --> 25:23.116
Hey, I thought you said she
wasn't your girlfriend, Mahoney.

25:23.196 --> 25:25.018
- Yeah, what's up with that?
- She's not.

25:25.098 --> 25:28.722
- Hey, whatever, man. It's cool.
- What's up?

25:28.802 --> 25:33.381
Sorry. It's just... there's this guy
I'm supposed to meet after school...

25:33.461 --> 25:36.589
and I was hoping you
would come along with me and...

25:36.669 --> 25:39.954
kind of, make sure everything's safe.

25:40.215 --> 25:42.471
- Who is it?
- Just some guy.

25:42.551 --> 25:45.909
So you want J here to
come along as your bodyguard?

25:45.989 --> 25:47.697
- Yeah.
- Well, ain't that sweet.

25:47.777 --> 25:51.316
- Justin, the bodyguard.
- Will you carry my books for me, Justin?

25:51.396 --> 25:54.396
- Will you wipe my ass for me, Justin?
- Will you kiss my ass for me, Daryl?

25:54.432 --> 25:57.093
- Only if you wipe it.
- Will you do it?

25:57.173 --> 25:59.092
- You said it was after school?
- Yeah.

25:59.172 --> 26:01.896
- Don't we have practice?
- Since when did that stop you?

26:01.976 --> 26:05.933
Yeah, we'll just tell coach that
you're busy, being a bodyguard.

26:06.013 --> 26:08.935
- Doing your good deed for the day.
- Never mind.

26:09.018 --> 26:11.641
J, the bodyguard.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.426
Your name Cassie?

27:08.287 --> 27:10.061
Yeah.

27:10.188 --> 27:12.171
I'm Kyle Martin.

27:12.251 --> 27:14.290
Hop in.

27:21.935 --> 27:25.621
So it was right after the accident?
That's when it all started?

27:25.960 --> 27:28.262
Yeah. Like a couple days later.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.414
Never try to kill yourself
or nothing before that?

27:33.908 --> 27:38.511
Mine started about six months ago.
OD'd on some bad smack.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.486
Been clean ever since.

27:43.441 --> 27:45.716
What makes you think it's a demon?

27:46.098 --> 27:47.707
Because it's bad.

27:47.787 --> 27:51.467
Real bad. The stuff it puts
in your head, and makes you see.

27:52.550 --> 27:57.038
- What kind of stuff?
- Scariest stuff you'll ever see.

27:59.325 --> 28:01.543
I've been having nightmares.

28:01.623 --> 28:05.373
That's how it starts.
The thing's gaining its influence on you.

28:05.453 --> 28:07.851
There been any accidents yet?

28:08.313 --> 28:10.936
- Like what?
- People you know getting killed.

28:11.016 --> 28:12.699
No.

28:12.993 --> 28:15.611
Good. But it'll happen.

28:15.691 --> 28:18.507
The thing goes after anyone
who tries to help you.

28:20.456 --> 28:22.728
You had people die?

28:26.410 --> 28:30.003
- Is it close yet?
- What do you mean?

28:30.283 --> 28:32.779
How far away is it when you see it?

28:33.601 --> 28:36.231
I don't know. Like across the room.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.467
Good, then. You're still good.
But it'll get closer...

28:40.547 --> 28:43.497
- and that's when you need to worry.
- Why?

28:43.577 --> 28:46.955
'Cause you'll feel it in your head
like a siren going off day and night.

28:47.035 --> 28:49.726
The thing just keep ripping
at your thoughts.

28:49.806 --> 28:52.526
I only found one way to turn it off.

28:55.481 --> 28:57.788
This sometimes works too.

28:58.146 --> 29:03.660
You twist, and the pain gives your brain
something else to focus on.

29:05.138 --> 29:07.918
I'm freaking you out
by all of this, aren't I?

29:08.461 --> 29:10.350
Kinda.

29:10.430 --> 29:13.928
Well, get used to it. 'Cause
the folks who couldn't turn it off...

29:14.008 --> 29:16.530
they're the ones
that killed themselves.

29:24.516 --> 29:26.136
Doug.

29:26.216 --> 29:28.346
I was hoping I'd catch you.

29:28.626 --> 29:30.139
What is it?

29:30.219 --> 29:33.269
About our conversation the other day.

29:33.349 --> 29:36.966
Perhaps I was a bit, abrupt.

29:37.757 --> 29:40.989
About the church's teachings about demons?

29:41.069 --> 29:44.852
- Yes.
- No. No, you were fine.

29:45.332 --> 29:48.647
And the truth is, you're probably right.

29:51.712 --> 29:55.619
I've been giving it a lot of thought
since Katie Dunne's funeral, and...

29:57.463 --> 30:01.042
I've been having a rough time
with some of the church's teachings.

30:02.025 --> 30:04.414
With regards to demons?

30:04.494 --> 30:06.987
With regards to everything.

30:08.483 --> 30:11.097
Would you like to talk about it?

30:13.104 --> 30:15.754
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.424
Maggie Dunne stopped by earlier today.

30:19.504 --> 30:22.991
She was so angry, and full of hate.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.205
And the more I tried to talk
to her about God's mercy...

30:25.229 --> 30:28.282
and how her daughter's
in a better place...

30:29.185 --> 30:31.345
the more it struck me.

30:31.425 --> 30:33.842
I don't know if I believe that anymore.

30:50.415 --> 30:53.535
Be right back. I'm gonna go check on Cass.

30:59.726 --> 31:03.888
- Girl, come dance with us.
- I'm not in the mood.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.189
Snap out of it.
You've been in this funk all night.

31:08.569 --> 31:12.153
Have a shot, Cass.
It'll take the edge off.

31:14.510 --> 31:18.594
That's more like it. Come dance with us.

31:42.743 --> 31:46.260
Hey. Hey, he's here.

31:48.916 --> 31:51.933
Cassie? Cassie, wait up.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.788
Leave me alone!

32:34.004 --> 32:37.356
Cassie? Cassie, are you okay? Cassie?

32:37.436 --> 32:39.721
He's the one!
He's the one who's doing this!

32:39.801 --> 32:42.287
Come on, you guys, let's get her home.

35:46.397 --> 35:49.606
Get out! Just get out!

37:21.575 --> 37:24.051
Is this what you wanted?

37:29.960 --> 37:31.671
Cassie?

37:32.412 --> 37:34.158
Cassie!

37:53.914 --> 37:58.019
Cassie. Cassie. Now.

37:59.695 --> 38:03.209
That's it. That's it. You're safe now.

38:04.235 --> 38:07.014
You're in my office. You're safe.

38:08.335 --> 38:10.590
That's it, shake it off.

38:13.287 --> 38:15.694
Do you remember that night now?

38:15.774 --> 38:18.334
The night you tried to kill yourself.

38:22.214 --> 38:24.303
He was there.

38:25.149 --> 38:27.306
And everyone was dead.

38:27.386 --> 38:29.818
What about your friends? Were they there?

38:30.758 --> 38:33.036
They were dead too.

38:34.963 --> 38:39.346
This is a place you've been too, isn't it?
A rave party, I believe they're called.

38:42.504 --> 38:45.167
Are you familiar
with a drug called ecstasy?

38:47.200 --> 38:50.013
I believe they're popular
at these parties.

38:50.815 --> 38:52.704
I've heard of it.

38:52.784 --> 38:55.053
Have you ever taken it?

38:56.021 --> 38:57.868
Sometimes.

38:59.287 --> 39:01.637
You're not gonna tell my parents, are you?

39:01.717 --> 39:06.056
They're very worried about you, Cassie.
They care for you deeply.

39:06.136 --> 39:09.991
No, they don't.
They only care about themselves.

39:10.771 --> 39:13.324
Perhaps they have
a difficult time showing it...

39:13.404 --> 39:15.852
but I assure you, they do care.

39:15.932 --> 39:19.084
Cassie, is there something wrong?

39:19.164 --> 39:21.495
You don't hear that?

39:22.088 --> 39:24.131
What are you hearing?

39:24.211 --> 39:27.533
It's like a buzz.

39:30.649 --> 39:32.710
He's coming.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.678
What is it, Cassie? What just happened?

39:56.758 --> 39:58.827
He was here.

39:59.625 --> 40:02.257
He was standing right behind you.

40:03.132 --> 40:06.523
I assure you,
there was no one here but us.

40:06.603 --> 40:11.927
No. He was here. He knows about you now.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.187
I think he's coming for you.

40:24.859 --> 40:27.501
Hey. How ya feeling?

40:28.429 --> 40:30.449
Okay, I guess.

40:32.368 --> 40:34.657
Can I come in?

40:34.937 --> 40:38.285
Aren't you afraid your buddies
will see you talking to me?

40:40.377 --> 40:43.048
Right now I could really care less.

40:45.069 --> 40:47.363
I brought you these.

40:48.641 --> 40:52.324
Notes from class. I didn't know
how long you'd be in here.

41:01.269 --> 41:02.983
Thanks.

41:10.346 --> 41:13.395
So... what are you doing here?

41:15.084 --> 41:17.208
I don't know.
Just seeing how you're doing.

41:17.288 --> 41:18.979
Crappy.

41:26.530 --> 41:28.855
Can I ask you something, Cass?

41:28.935 --> 41:31.057
I guess.

41:31.337 --> 41:33.718
It's okay if you don't want to answer.

41:37.877 --> 41:40.862
You wanna know why I tried to kill myself.

41:44.519 --> 41:46.924
I saw your parents at church.

41:47.804 --> 41:51.506
They told me about it. About Scotty.

41:52.896 --> 41:57.456
So that's the real reason why you came?
My mom put you up to this?

41:57.536 --> 41:59.297
No.

42:03.258 --> 42:05.268
No, I came...

42:05.853 --> 42:09.075
I came because an old friend
tried to kill herself.

42:10.863 --> 42:13.994
And it made me realize
what a complete dick I've been.

42:17.054 --> 42:19.520
I'm so sorry, Cass.

42:23.232 --> 42:25.701
I'm scared, Justin.

42:26.493 --> 42:29.050
I don't know what's happening to me.

42:39.416 --> 42:41.672
Hey, father.

42:41.752 --> 42:46.579
You got a couple seconds? I need
to talk to you about Cassie Stevens.

42:46.659 --> 42:48.965
Yeah, sure, Justin.

42:49.956 --> 42:51.971
How is she?

42:52.051 --> 42:56.157
I've known Cassie my whole life,
and I've never seen her this scared.

42:56.537 --> 42:59.395
She's had these visions
ever since her accident?

42:59.475 --> 43:03.600
And it's always in the corner of her eye.
Like in that old saying.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.637
Evil hides in the periphery.

43:06.717 --> 43:08.994
So you believe her, right?

43:09.074 --> 43:11.559
That she really is seeing this thing?

43:11.839 --> 43:13.759
That's something we should
let her doctor decide.

43:13.787 --> 43:17.771
But he doesn't believe in demons,
or spirits, or anything.

43:17.851 --> 43:20.074
Thinks it's all made up in her head.

43:20.154 --> 43:22.972
In all likelihood, he's probably correct.

43:23.552 --> 43:26.346
Look, Justin,
I know you want to help her...

43:26.426 --> 43:30.594
but these visions could have resulted from
her head injuries or any number of causes.

43:30.674 --> 43:34.736
But what if they didn't?
What if she really is seeing this thing?

43:35.348 --> 43:39.399
I'm sorry, Justin, but I'm inclined
to agree with her doctor.

43:41.814 --> 43:43.997
Well, he's wrong.

43:44.077 --> 43:49.198
Something's after her,
that he can't stop, but you could.

43:54.533 --> 43:58.123
You know, I thought priests
were here to help people.

48:24.925 --> 48:26.814
What are you guys doing here?

48:26.894 --> 48:29.248
Liberating you, girl.

48:29.328 --> 48:31.452
We haven't seen you
since they locked you up.

48:31.532 --> 48:34.955
I'm not locked up. They're helping me.

48:35.035 --> 48:38.442
Right. 'Cause you looked
so helped just now.

48:38.922 --> 48:41.389
You're still seeing him, aren't you?

48:42.213 --> 48:44.457
The judges will accept that as a yes.

48:44.537 --> 48:47.782
How about a little midnight snack, Cass.

48:47.862 --> 48:50.701
All the help you need's right here.

48:51.955 --> 48:53.946
I can't.

48:54.026 --> 48:56.273
You mean, you won't.

48:57.362 --> 49:01.751
Jeez, girl.
They really did a number on you.

49:02.231 --> 49:05.527
I think someone needs to intervene
on this intervention.

49:05.607 --> 49:07.928
Will you guys go?

49:08.008 --> 49:10.187
Not till we get our Cass back.

49:10.267 --> 49:13.059
The one who likes to have fun.

49:15.085 --> 49:20.721
Come on, Cass. One little pill
will make all the bad things go away.

49:20.801 --> 49:23.958
See. I'll even do one.

49:26.774 --> 49:28.721
Nothing to it.

49:28.901 --> 49:31.432
What are you scared of, Cass?

49:32.187 --> 49:34.752
Are you afraid of dying?

49:35.574 --> 49:39.399
Hell, death can't touch us, now.

49:40.179 --> 49:42.328
We are dead.

49:46.020 --> 49:48.470
See ya soon, Cass.

50:13.085 --> 50:15.550
Good. Good, Cassie.

50:15.630 --> 50:19.148
That's it, Cassie. Shake it out.

50:20.828 --> 50:25.053
I was there again. At the accident.

50:25.933 --> 50:28.342
In your mind, you were.

50:28.749 --> 50:30.970
Do you remember what you saw?

50:32.743 --> 50:34.853
They were dead.

50:34.933 --> 50:39.124
Seth, Trish and Silvia.

50:39.604 --> 50:41.728
We were in the car...

50:42.849 --> 50:45.112
and they were all dead.

50:46.058 --> 50:49.808
I felt it best
that you recall that for yourself.

50:56.671 --> 50:58.417
So...

50:59.993 --> 51:02.425
they really are dead?

51:02.505 --> 51:04.734
I'm afraid so.

51:05.124 --> 51:08.309
You see, Cassie, what you've been
experiencing is...

51:08.389 --> 51:11.877
what is known as survivor's guilt.

51:12.304 --> 51:14.807
It's a defense mechanism
the brain constructs...

51:14.887 --> 51:18.746
in order to avoid dealing
with tragic losses.

51:18.826 --> 51:23.747
But... I saw them.
They were here last night.

51:24.971 --> 51:27.752
You also said, they were dead.

51:28.542 --> 51:31.591
And that woman I saw in the hallway?

51:33.946 --> 51:35.966
Who I also said was dead.

51:38.185 --> 51:43.494
See, all of that is part of your
memory finally awakening...

51:43.574 --> 51:46.299
to the reality
of what happened that night.

51:46.379 --> 51:48.864
The death of your friends.

51:48.944 --> 51:53.892
Now, it's time for the healing
process to begin.

51:57.910 --> 52:01.192
So that was the last time you saw
this thing? About a week ago?

52:01.815 --> 52:05.279
Yeah. But it's still there.

52:05.359 --> 52:07.953
You know when you just...

52:08.033 --> 52:10.645
feel you're being watched?

52:14.546 --> 52:17.357
I feel it every hour of every day.

52:17.437 --> 52:21.250
It's like he's just there... waiting.

52:22.437 --> 52:24.719
Waiting for what?

52:26.008 --> 52:28.723
I don't know. The right moment?

52:32.250 --> 52:34.614
Did you tell your doctor any of this?

52:36.728 --> 52:38.687
It wouldn't do any good.

52:38.767 --> 52:43.325
He'd just say it was some kind
of left over trauma mumbo jumbo crap.

52:43.705 --> 52:46.045
Try to lock me up again.

52:47.901 --> 52:50.958
- Don't say it, Mahoney.
- Say what?

52:51.038 --> 52:54.424
Any cracks about me being locked up again.

52:56.244 --> 53:00.078
So this guy we're meeting,
he's the one with the blog?

53:01.111 --> 53:04.152
Yeah. His name's Kyle.

53:04.532 --> 53:06.310
He thinks he knows how to stop it.

53:06.390 --> 53:09.936
There wasn't anyone
who lived closer we could talk to?

53:14.232 --> 53:16.004
They're all dead.

53:30.152 --> 53:32.166
Is this it?

53:33.254 --> 53:35.893
It's the address he sent me.

53:37.247 --> 53:39.507
And that's his car.

53:42.166 --> 53:44.815
Alright. Let's go.

54:01.521 --> 54:03.223
Kyle?

54:03.303 --> 54:05.622
Kyle, it's Cassie.

54:06.277 --> 54:08.583
I brought a friend.

54:11.734 --> 54:14.123
How well do you know this guy?

54:14.503 --> 54:18.521
We just met once.
But we chatted on the Internet.

54:20.944 --> 54:23.434
You think it's cool if we just come in?

54:23.914 --> 54:27.299
Yeah. We'll just say the door was open.

54:34.260 --> 54:37.262
Kyle? Kyle, are you here?

54:45.364 --> 54:47.477
It stinks.

55:05.947 --> 55:09.581
Holy shit! What is all this stuff?

55:17.177 --> 55:19.459
It's what he sees.

55:20.230 --> 55:22.579
Do you see any of this?

55:23.351 --> 55:25.484
Just the one right there.

55:25.564 --> 55:28.972
But he warned me
I'd start seeing other things.

55:36.433 --> 55:38.591
Do you smell that?

55:47.379 --> 55:49.169
Cass?

55:50.454 --> 55:52.903
Cass, come here. You need to see this.

56:02.865 --> 56:05.357
What the hell is this?

56:07.737 --> 56:09.556
It's him.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.464
Go ahead and call the number on this card.

57:10.544 --> 57:13.168
Schedule a time for the two of you
to come down to the station...

57:13.248 --> 57:15.106
make an official statement.

57:19.822 --> 57:22.246
Is there anything else you need from us?

57:23.126 --> 57:24.907
No.

57:25.770 --> 57:28.285
But you should probably get her home.

57:30.034 --> 57:31.778
Thank you.

57:34.055 --> 57:35.763
Cass?

57:36.681 --> 57:39.056
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

57:42.860 --> 57:45.931
This doesn't mean anything, alright?
You're not that guy.

57:49.157 --> 57:51.486
It's not just him...

57:52.276 --> 57:54.912
it's everyone that thing went after.

57:55.446 --> 57:57.604
They're all dead.

57:58.034 --> 58:01.288
Except you. You're not dead.

58:01.368 --> 58:04.792
And you're not gonna be dead, okay?
Not from that thing.

58:07.344 --> 58:09.792
I don't know what to do.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.528
I think I know someone who does.

58:22.863 --> 58:26.253
Father, I need to speak with you
about Cassie Stevens.

58:26.333 --> 58:31.088
- How does it feel to kill a child?
- Yes. Yes, I heard about the incident.

58:31.703 --> 58:34.309
- How is she?
- Honey, are you okay?

58:34.389 --> 58:37.241
Cassie. Cassie, calm down.

58:39.716 --> 58:42.300
She... they have her
sedated at the hospital.

58:42.380 --> 58:45.142
She's scheduled to have
some tests run later today.

58:45.222 --> 58:47.487
God love her.

58:48.817 --> 58:51.879
Let's pray they find out
what's wrong with her.

58:54.733 --> 58:57.757
Justin Mahoney spoke with me
about her last week.

58:57.837 --> 59:02.312
He's worried that her problems
are more of a... spiritual nature.

59:04.495 --> 59:06.509
How so?

59:07.783 --> 59:10.999
He believes she's the target
of diabolical attacks.

59:12.221 --> 59:14.609
What makes him think that?

59:15.428 --> 59:17.883
Cassie told him about visions
of a specter...

59:17.963 --> 59:20.315
she's been seeing
out of the corner of her eye.

59:20.645 --> 59:23.959
She feels that this spirit wants her dead,

59:24.039 --> 59:28.768
and apparently her doctor's dismissed
the possibility of supernatural causes.

59:29.875 --> 59:32.097
What do you believe?

59:32.863 --> 59:35.400
I told him I agreed with the doctor.

59:37.676 --> 59:41.460
That was before I saw the look
in her eyes outside the church.

59:42.204 --> 59:44.610
I've never seen anything
as horrific as the fear she had.

59:44.690 --> 59:47.225
Maggie, please.

59:50.214 --> 59:52.725
It wasn't a fear of death.

59:52.805 --> 59:55.731
She was terrified of something far worse.

59:57.774 --> 01:00:01.461
We're gonna have a fun time explaining
this when we get you out of here.

01:00:03.263 --> 01:00:06.088
Sorry, I was just trying to cheer you up.

01:00:06.468 --> 01:00:08.323
I know.

01:00:09.153 --> 01:00:11.301
Hey. You need to get better,
so we can have a rematch...

01:00:11.325 --> 01:00:14.204
for all those times you kicked
my ass when we were kids.

01:00:16.497 --> 01:00:18.833
I know why I saw it again.

01:00:19.597 --> 01:00:21.835
It was the church.

01:00:22.504 --> 01:00:24.894
What did the church have to do with it?

01:00:25.774 --> 01:00:27.324
That thing.

01:00:28.355 --> 01:00:30.445
It hates God.

01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:34.106
And it fed off that woman's anger.

01:00:37.086 --> 01:00:41.364
It wants me dead, Justin.
And it's not gonna quit.

01:00:42.728 --> 01:00:45.118
Well, that's not gonna happen.

01:00:45.698 --> 01:00:48.182
I don't know how to stop it.

01:00:53.707 --> 01:00:55.514
Cassie?

01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:01.743
I just want to apologize.

01:01:05.521 --> 01:01:07.610
Just need you to sign this, doctor.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.538
- Sure. Right here?
- Yep.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:15.152
- Dr. Switzer?
- Yes. May I help you?

01:01:15.232 --> 01:01:17.211
I'm Father Jenkins.

01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:21.363
I left a message for you earlier
about a patient of yours...

01:01:21.443 --> 01:01:23.462
Cassie Stevens.

01:01:23.802 --> 01:01:28.093
Yes. The parish priest.
What can I do for you, father?

01:01:29.529 --> 01:01:31.798
Is there a place we can talk in private?

01:01:31.878 --> 01:01:34.200
Certainly. Follow me.

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:40.053
I'm concerned about Cassie, doctor.

01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:44.154
How do you feel she's responding
to her treatment?

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:49.192
We haven't isolated the cause of her
dementia yet, if that's what you're asking.

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.380
Have you considered the possibility...

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.305
that Cassie may actually
be seeing these things?

01:01:56.682 --> 01:01:58.538
Spirits?

01:01:58.941 --> 01:02:03.370
No, father. I'll leave that area
to men such as yourself.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:06.767
My focus is on the neurological cause.

01:02:06.847 --> 01:02:10.045
And... suppose there is none?

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:11.879
Then we look elsewhere.

01:02:11.959 --> 01:02:15.552
Does that elsewhere
include the possibility...

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.755
of demonic attack?

01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:22.554
Father, if I may be frank...

01:02:23.818 --> 01:02:27.766
the church's obsession
with demons and spirits...

01:02:28.646 --> 01:02:31.847
is what may have planted the idea...

01:02:31.927 --> 01:02:34.580
in Cassie's head to begin with.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:38.099
So you don't believe in demons?

01:02:38.179 --> 01:02:40.109
No, father, I don't.

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:42.527
And in twenty years of psychiatry...

01:02:42.607 --> 01:02:47.291
I've only had one patient suffering
from a dementia similar to Cassie's...

01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:49.864
who I wasn't able
to successfully treat.

01:02:49.944 --> 01:02:54.208
Well, then consider the consequences.

01:02:54.892 --> 01:02:57.821
You see, if I'm wrong...

01:02:58.001 --> 01:03:00.480
Cassie loses her sanity.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.585
If you're wrong...

01:03:04.665 --> 01:03:07.426
she loses her soul.

01:03:09.328 --> 01:03:12.904
Father, I am fully aware
of the consequences.

01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:18.898
And I assure you, that Cassie Stevens
will have the very best in medical care.

01:03:18.978 --> 01:03:21.386
Now, was there anything else?

01:03:21.616 --> 01:03:24.414
No. That was it.

01:03:24.494 --> 01:03:26.556
I appreciate your time.

01:03:26.922 --> 01:03:30.959
We're all very concerned
with Cassie's well being, father.

01:03:32.046 --> 01:03:34.170
By the way...

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:38.047
what happened to that other patient?

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.192
She died.

01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.585
As a matter of fact,
right here at this hospital.

01:03:46.765 --> 01:03:49.427
She was found with her neck slit open.

01:03:55.388 --> 01:03:57.361
Self inflicted.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.468
I am very sorry to hear about that.

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:08.967
I'd like to leave this with you, doctor...

01:04:09.047 --> 01:04:13.702
in case you run out
of those neurological causes.

01:04:14.182 --> 01:04:16.569
Which I suspect you might.

01:04:17.849 --> 01:04:21.300
This is a case for demonic possession.

01:04:24.088 --> 01:04:27.277
I lost my husband Jack three years ago.

01:04:28.509 --> 01:04:31.562
And since then, Katie's been my life.

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.715
Was my life.

01:04:36.267 --> 01:04:37.903
Mrs. Dunne...

01:04:37.983 --> 01:04:41.324
Please. Just... let me finish.

01:04:45.484 --> 01:04:47.673
This belonged to Katie.

01:04:50.163 --> 01:04:53.522
She used to take it with her
everywhere she went.

01:04:59.004 --> 01:05:01.287
I want you to have it.

01:05:02.016 --> 01:05:03.671
- Me?
- Yes.

01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:07.694
No, really, Mrs. Dunne.
It was your daughter's. I can't.

01:05:07.774 --> 01:05:10.044
Please. Just take it.

01:05:11.847 --> 01:05:13.935
I can't explain it.

01:05:14.015 --> 01:05:18.814
But just something inside me
tells me that she wants you to have it.

01:05:30.634 --> 01:05:34.518
Thank you. I'm so sorry.

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:39.453
I know you are, dear.

01:05:41.916 --> 01:05:43.935
I know you are.

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.925
And I forgive you.

01:05:57.433 --> 01:06:00.450
And I know that Katie forgives you too.

01:06:07.143 --> 01:06:09.677
I see you took my advice.

01:06:11.186 --> 01:06:13.351
What'd you think?

01:06:15.587 --> 01:06:18.110
Not the book to be reading
when you're all alone.

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:20.388
No, I suppose it isn't.

01:06:20.468 --> 01:06:24.552
And the book can't compare
to the experience itself.

01:06:24.942 --> 01:06:29.278
You mentioned that the other day.
About feeling their threat.

01:06:34.643 --> 01:06:38.744
And a part of me has never recovered
from that experience.

01:06:41.466 --> 01:06:45.210
It was a direct encounter
with hatred, Doug.

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.784
With a being that is so cruel...

01:06:49.344 --> 01:06:51.113
foul...

01:06:51.193 --> 01:06:55.524
and superior,
and without a trace of mercy.

01:06:57.624 --> 01:06:59.730
It happened when...

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:03.369
when I was assigned
to my first parish...

01:07:03.995 --> 01:07:05.690
in Ohio.

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.923
There had been a series
of killings, murders...

01:07:09.253 --> 01:07:12.014
in the Columbus area...

01:07:12.684 --> 01:07:15.600
and the police
were finally tipped off...

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:20.241
that a group of high school kids
were responsible for the killings.

01:07:21.931 --> 01:07:25.965
They traced these kids
to an abandoned building.

01:07:26.637 --> 01:07:29.656
Inside the building, the found a basement.

01:07:30.436 --> 01:07:33.514
What they found there, shocked...

01:07:33.594 --> 01:07:37.040
even the most hardened of them.

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:48.243
I was brought onto the case
because they suspected satanic...

01:07:48.723 --> 01:07:51.574
ritualism was involved.

01:07:53.754 --> 01:07:58.398
But by the time I arrived,
it was too late.

01:07:58.478 --> 01:08:02.059
During the night, the girl...

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:08.665
had chewed through her own wrist.

01:08:09.222 --> 01:08:12.776
But she left a message for us
on the wall...

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.033
in her own blood.

01:08:15.963 --> 01:08:18.279
Ava Satani.

01:08:19.559 --> 01:08:22.240
Hail, satan.

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:26.301
Evil is real, Doug.

01:08:26.581 --> 01:08:31.349
And so is the threat
it poses to the bodies...

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.906
and the souls of its victims.

01:09:14.098 --> 01:09:16.178
You're Katie, aren't you?

01:09:18.135 --> 01:09:21.652
- I'm Cassie.
- I know.

01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:26.292
I'm so sorry, Katie.

01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:35.745
Thank you.

01:09:36.725 --> 01:09:39.413
He's wrong about the man.

01:09:39.694 --> 01:09:43.285
- Who's wrong?
- The doctor.

01:09:43.365 --> 01:09:45.087
You see him, too?

01:09:45.167 --> 01:09:47.863
He's here right now.

01:09:51.576 --> 01:09:54.591
Only God can help you, Cassie.

01:10:07.227 --> 01:10:09.457
It's alright, Cassie.

01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:12.573
You're in my office. You're safe now.

01:10:15.243 --> 01:10:17.960
What is it, Cassie? What did you see?

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.881
The little girl.

01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:23.207
The one I've been seeing.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:27.486
I know who she is now.

01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:30.366
Her name's Katie.

01:10:30.832 --> 01:10:33.237
She was killed in the other car.

01:10:39.132 --> 01:10:42.901
This little girl.
Did she say anything to you?

01:10:45.339 --> 01:10:47.035
Yeah.

01:10:47.659 --> 01:10:49.693
She said you're wrong about the man.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:57.645
And... she gave me this.

01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:09.586
Come in.

01:11:13.505 --> 01:11:16.996
I've got the results from the MRI
you ordered for Cassie Stevens.

01:11:17.076 --> 01:11:19.444
Good. Let's have a look.

01:11:32.493 --> 01:11:36.742
- Were there any abnormalities?
- None the radiologist could find.

01:11:37.216 --> 01:11:40.154
Said it looked like a normal human skull.

01:11:41.437 --> 01:11:44.396
What about the other files?
Anything there?

01:11:44.476 --> 01:11:46.689
Pretty much the same.

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:52.163
If there's anything going on up there,
it sure didn't show up on the test results.

01:11:55.721 --> 01:11:57.803
Apparently not.

01:11:58.691 --> 01:12:03.176
Do you wanna try again? Maybe
recalibrate and run a few more tests?

01:12:03.564 --> 01:12:06.045
No, I don't think so.

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:08.277
Thank you, Charlie.

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.506
Not a problem, doctor.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:12:10.586 --> 01:12:12.457
Good night.

01:12:41.409 --> 01:12:43.125
Hello?

01:12:44.178 --> 01:12:46.261
Is someone there?

01:13:03.484 --> 01:13:05.258
I'm sorry.

01:13:05.338 --> 01:13:08.479
But the church is closed for the night.

01:13:11.611 --> 01:13:13.684
Oh, Lord.

01:13:15.837 --> 01:13:17.875
Are you okay?

01:13:26.129 --> 01:13:28.825
I didn't come for the church, father.

01:13:30.143 --> 01:13:32.325
I came for you.

01:14:36.946 --> 01:14:38.902
Page 52.

01:14:38.982 --> 01:14:40.471
Cynthia...

01:14:40.551 --> 01:14:45.466
locate the article from
New York reporter referencing...

01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:48.422
footnote 8.

01:14:58.136 --> 01:14:59.851
Hello?

01:15:06.279 --> 01:15:08.060
Hello?

01:15:17.426 --> 01:15:19.274
Who's there?

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:34.222
Mrs. Johnson? Everything alright?

01:15:44.558 --> 01:15:46.634
Working late, Dr. Switzer?

01:15:46.744 --> 01:15:49.632
Yes. Apparently too late.

01:15:50.266 --> 01:15:51.891
Yeah.

01:15:52.478 --> 01:15:56.452
Don't you worry.
I'll get these lights fixed up in no time.

01:15:56.532 --> 01:15:58.854
I'm sure it's just a fuse.

01:15:59.377 --> 01:16:02.704
Yeah, well, I guess it's time
for me to call it a night anyway.

01:16:02.784 --> 01:16:05.958
- Goodnight, Todd.
- Goodnight, doc.

01:16:06.738 --> 01:16:09.114
You drive safe now.

01:16:29.177 --> 01:16:31.242
Have Cynthia...

01:16:31.422 --> 01:16:36.682
schedule a meeting with Father
Jenkins at Saint Matthews Parish.

01:17:09.724 --> 01:17:13.027
This is Dr. Switzer,
Hillview Medical Center.

01:17:13.707 --> 01:17:17.919
If this tape recording is found,
deliver it to Father Jenkins...

01:17:17.999 --> 01:17:19.729
Saint Matthews Parish.

01:17:19.809 --> 01:17:21.485
Father...

01:17:21.565 --> 01:17:25.169
I'm afraid you were right
in your assessment of Cassie Stevens.

01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:48.694
Cassie, if you hear this,
you must see Father Jenkins right away.

01:17:48.774 --> 01:17:51.070
Your life depends on it.

01:19:08.298 --> 01:19:11.415
I'm so sorry, Doug.

01:19:12.836 --> 01:19:14.426
Thanks.

01:19:14.506 --> 01:19:17.913
If you'd like, I can go ahead
and make arrangements for his funeral.

01:19:17.993 --> 01:19:22.755
No. You don't have to do that.
You should go home.

01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:26.220
Really, it's no trouble.

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.647
It's probably better
if I keep myself busy anyway.

01:19:31.223 --> 01:19:33.464
I'm gonna miss him.

01:19:39.716 --> 01:19:42.125
I didn't know who to give it to.

01:19:42.805 --> 01:19:44.520
Thanks.

01:19:47.178 --> 01:19:49.611
I'll see you tomorrow?

01:20:05.281 --> 01:20:09.303
Cassie, if you hear this,
you must see Father Jenkins right away.

01:20:09.383 --> 01:20:11.688
Your life depends on it.

01:20:34.032 --> 01:20:36.187
Father McCready.

01:20:36.267 --> 01:20:38.459
Father, it's Justin.
I think something's wrong.

01:20:38.539 --> 01:20:42.315
- What is it?
- Cassie's phone, it's dead.

01:20:42.985 --> 01:20:46.645
It rings once, then just goes silent.
I've tried like five times.

01:20:46.725 --> 01:20:50.497
- Is it disconnected?
- It's her home phone, and her cell.

01:20:51.552 --> 01:20:54.436
Get over there right now. I'm on my way.

01:20:58.377 --> 01:21:01.097
Cassie? Honey, are you awake?

01:21:02.379 --> 01:21:05.277
Do you want to ride with me
to the airport?

01:21:51.877 --> 01:21:54.542
He's coming, Cassie. You need to go.

01:22:30.938 --> 01:22:33.943
Mom? Dad?

01:22:41.783 --> 01:22:43.490
Hello?

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.743
Hello?

01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:16.067
Hello?

01:23:18.501 --> 01:23:20.215
Hello?

01:24:07.516 --> 01:24:09.226
Hello?

01:24:12.406 --> 01:24:14.123
Hello?

01:24:29.569 --> 01:24:32.467
No. But you're dead.

01:24:32.747 --> 01:24:35.362
It's time for you to join us, Cassie.

01:24:37.487 --> 01:24:41.446
We'll be together again, Cassie.
Just like before.

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:45.459
Take the knife, Cassie.

01:25:24.175 --> 01:25:25.890
Cassie!

01:25:31.349 --> 01:25:33.106
Cassie?

01:25:33.286 --> 01:25:35.007
Justin?

01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:38.882
- Cassie?
- Justin! Justin, over here!

01:25:40.246 --> 01:25:43.719
- They're here. They're in this room.
- Come on, we'll get you out of here.

01:25:43.799 --> 01:25:46.687
No. There's no time.
We need to do this now.

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:50.460
- Can you do this?
- Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:53.454
Here, hold this candle.
Hold it so I can read.

01:25:54.444 --> 01:25:57.560
- Can you read for the assistant?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:25:58.616 --> 01:26:01.632
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:09.878
- Justin. I need you to focus.
- Okay.

01:26:13.066 --> 01:26:15.547
Be merciful on us, oh, Lord...

01:26:15.927 --> 01:26:19.560
and save this young child,
Your servant.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.562
Because she hopes in You, oh, Lord.

01:26:21.642 --> 01:26:24.657
Be a tower of strength for her, oh, Lord.

01:26:40.465 --> 01:26:43.890
- Be a tower of strength for her, oh, Lord.
- In the face of the enemy...

01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:46.125
Let the enemy have no power over her...

01:26:46.205 --> 01:26:49.128
And let the son of iniquity
not succeed in injuring her.

01:26:49.208 --> 01:26:52.491
- Lord, hear my prayer...
- And let my cry reach you.

01:26:53.463 --> 01:26:55.244
Go, father!

01:27:00.723 --> 01:27:02.865
God of mercy...

01:27:02.945 --> 01:27:07.312
come to the assistance of this child,
you created in your own image.

01:27:07.892 --> 01:27:12.204
And cast into the bottomless pit
the spirit that torments her.

01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:17.830
We drive you from her unclean spirits
and all satanic powers...

01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:20.483
in the Name and power
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:27:21.563 --> 01:27:23.145
Justin!

01:27:54.953 --> 01:27:57.202
Cassie.

01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:06.066
- Cassie.
- Cassie.

01:28:07.066 --> 01:28:10.592
- Come with us.
- Come with us, Cassie.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.132
- Join us, Cassie.
- Be a part of us.

01:28:17.212 --> 01:28:20.202
- Come with us.
- Come with us, Cassie.

01:28:20.282 --> 01:28:24.575
Come with us. It can all go away.

01:28:25.555 --> 01:28:28.996
Please. Please, just leave me alone.

01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:31.741
Take your life.

01:28:33.797 --> 01:28:35.922
- Do it, Cassie.
- Do it.

01:28:36.002 --> 01:28:38.992
- It'll all go away.
- Do it, Cassie.

01:28:39.072 --> 01:28:40.660
Take your life.

01:28:41.393 --> 01:28:43.531
Do it, Cassie.

01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.872
Do it! Do it!

01:28:47.015 --> 01:28:50.194
- Come with us.
- Come with us, Cassie.

01:29:24.509 --> 01:29:27.526
God, please help me.

01:29:49.087 --> 01:29:50.845
Okay.

01:29:52.296 --> 01:29:54.182
I'm ready.

01:30:04.239 --> 01:30:05.847
Cassie!

01:30:06.407 --> 01:30:08.730
Cassie? Can you hear me?

01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:10.167
Yeah.

01:30:10.847 --> 01:30:14.904
- We need to finish. Can you do that?
- Yeah! Yeah, just go.

01:30:14.984 --> 01:30:17.074
God the Father.

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:22.081
Crush the demon that plagues this child,
that she may again be clean.

01:30:22.857 --> 01:30:25.526
And drive it into the infernal wasteland.

01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:32.152
Behold your fate, unclean spirits,
the eternal fire that awaits you.

01:30:33.831 --> 01:30:37.654
By the power of God,
depart unclean spirits!

01:30:37.964 --> 01:30:41.142
Depart, and cease
your torments of this child.

01:30:44.019 --> 01:30:46.874
Cassie! Cassie! Go, go, go, go! Hurry!

01:30:46.954 --> 01:30:49.850
It is God Himself who commands it!

01:30:50.199 --> 01:30:52.854
The power of Christ, compels you!

01:30:52.934 --> 01:30:55.286
The blood of Christ, compels you!

01:30:55.546 --> 01:31:00.524
In the name of God, depart!
Cease now, it is God who commands it!

01:31:06.846 --> 01:31:09.015
Cassie. Cassie!

01:31:09.115 --> 01:31:11.939
Cassie! Are you okay?

01:31:13.519 --> 01:31:15.179
Yeah.

01:31:21.829 --> 01:31:23.853
What is it? Do you see them?

01:31:23.933 --> 01:31:25.738
No.

01:31:25.818 --> 01:31:29.400
They're gone. They're all gone.

01:31:35.513 --> 01:31:37.963
Thank God it's all over.

01:31:43.555 --> 01:31:45.403
Thank you.

01:32:36.818 --> 01:32:38.899
So this is her?

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:42.628
I just wanted to give her something.

01:32:45.595 --> 01:32:47.827
They were her favorites.

01:32:52.838 --> 01:32:55.090
Bye, Katie.
