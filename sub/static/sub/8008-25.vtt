- She's so merciful.
- COLONEL: Make way!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.538
Oh, merciful Princess.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.120
Uh...

10:21.287 --> 10:25.042
Thank you for sparing your lowly servant.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.668
(BANANA GUARDS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

10:26.793 --> 10:28.545
(STAMMERING) But... No, no, no.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.300
I'm just a person.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.549
I've done things in the past,

10:32.674 --> 10:34.051
things I'm not proud of.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.929
But today, I'm here to celebrate!

10:38.012 --> 10:40.140
- ALL: Oh!
- (BUBBLEGUM CHUCKLES)

10:40.515 --> 10:42.062
- Princess?
- Mmm-hmm?

10:43.309 --> 10:44.435
(IN DISTORTED VOICE) I love you.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.313
Wow.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.564
(NEIGHING)

10:49.315 --> 10:51.659
(APPLAUSE)

10:51.818 --> 10:54.446
My banana guards are so talented.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.907
I grew these...
(STUTTERS) Hydroponically.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.792
And I can actually play really good.

11:00.076 --> 11:04.172
- (BUGLE PLAYS)
- (VOCALIZING)

11:05.039 --> 11:06.336
Urn, Princess?

11:06.416 --> 11:07.463
Yes?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.215
I don't have a special talent.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.087
That's okay, too.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.680
Hooray!

11:14.924 --> 11:18.474
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:19.053 --> 11:22.933
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:28.109
This party is so crazy!
