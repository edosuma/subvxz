WEBVTT

00:29.480 --> 00:31.320
I am actress Milla Jovovich,

00:31.400 --> 00:34.650
and I will be portraying Dr.
Abigail Tyler in The Fourth Kind.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.110
This film is a dramatization

00:36.200 --> 00:39.570
of events that occurred October
1 st through the 9th of 2000,

00:39.660 --> 00:41.200
in the northern
Alaskan town of Nome.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.330
To better explain
the events of the story,

00:43.410 --> 00:44.950
the director has
included actual

00:45.040 --> 00:46.500
archived footage
throughout the film.

00:46.580 --> 00:50.000
This footage was acquired from
Nome psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler,

00:50.090 --> 00:54.670
who has personally documented over
65 hours of video and audio materials

00:54.760 --> 00:55.840
during the time
of the incidents.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.800
To better
protect their privacy,

00:57.880 --> 00:59.680
we have changed
the names and professions

00:59.760 --> 01:01.050
of many of
the people involved.

01:01.140 --> 01:03.600
Every dramatized scene
in this movie is supported

01:03.680 --> 01:05.720
by either
archived audio, video,

01:05.810 --> 01:07.810
or as it was related
by Dr. Tyler

01:07.890 --> 01:09.850
during extensive interviews
with the director.

01:09.940 --> 01:12.610
In the end, what you
believe is yours to decide.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.980
Please be advised
that some of what

01:15.070 --> 01:17.950
you are about to see
is extremely disturbing.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.830
OSUNSANMl: Just relax,
and I'll ask you questions,

01:22.910 --> 01:24.450
and whenever, whatever
you want to toss in there.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.040
Okay.
You all right?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.200
Okay.

01:27.290 --> 01:28.870
I'm going to try

01:28.960 --> 01:33.670
and make this as painless as possible.

01:34.630 --> 01:36.960
Can you state your
name for the camera?

01:37.130 --> 01:39.630
Dr. Abigail Emily Tyler.

01:41.010 --> 01:43.550
Okay, where would
you like to begin?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.970
I guess...

01:47.810 --> 01:52.310
After what happened with
will, my husband, I...

01:53.520 --> 01:57.690
I went to my friend, who is
also a psychologist, Dr...

01:59.280 --> 02:03.490
because I was having trouble
dealing with how he...

02:04.990 --> 02:07.490
with how it happened
and who did it.

02:08.620 --> 02:11.460
You don't think
you might need more time?

02:11.540 --> 02:17.170
No, this is something...
I have to do this.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.430
I have to remember
his face.

02:21.510 --> 02:24.340
I need it
for myself to heal.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.430
I have to try, and I have to
know that, for my children,

02:29.520 --> 02:32.140
that I did everything
that I could

02:32.770 --> 02:34.980
to remember.
...to remember.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.730
You know, since that night,
Ashley still can't see,

02:39.610 --> 02:43.700
and I don't think that she's
gonna get her sight back

02:43.780 --> 02:47.370
if she doesn't accept
what happened.

02:49.910 --> 02:54.210
Well, I think you both have the same
problem, just different symptoms.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.090
Yeah, and I think
that it could help

03:00.170 --> 03:02.930
if I could just remember
the face of that man,

03:03.800 --> 03:08.890
so we could somehow track him
down and set the record straight

03:10.980 --> 03:12.850
and find some closure.

03:14.730 --> 03:17.940
All right. All right.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.150
Do you want it
on video?

03:21.240 --> 03:22.490
Yeah.

03:22.570 --> 03:27.660
Counseling a fellow
psychologist is like...

03:27.740 --> 03:29.080
It's like talking to myself.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.370
You always
say that.

03:35.460 --> 03:38.170
I do? Oh, my God.

03:41.130 --> 03:42.460
All right.

03:44.430 --> 03:49.010
I guess just try to relax
and get yourself comfortable.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.430
Listen to the sound of
my voice as I count back.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.190
Ten...

03:57.270 --> 03:58.400
Nine...

03:59.110 --> 04:03.190
Eight, seven, six...

04:03.740 --> 04:05.030
Your eyes are
getting heavier...

04:05.110 --> 04:06.950
...and heavier.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.780
Five, four.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.660
They're almost closed.
They're almost closed.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.540
Three, two

04:15.620 --> 04:16.920
and one.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.040
...one.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.380
Very good, Abbey.
Very good.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.300
Let's go back
in time...

04:26.380 --> 04:27.970
Let's go
back in time...

04:28.550 --> 04:30.180
...back into
the past...

04:30.260 --> 04:31.810
...back
into the past...

04:32.600 --> 04:34.890
...to the night of
August 2nd of this year.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.310
...to the night of
August 2nd of this year.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.810
What was the weather like?

04:39.900 --> 04:43.150
Warm.
Warmer than usual,

04:44.820 --> 04:48.200
even though it's
raining outside.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.530
Okay, good.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.910
Now, let's go back to
when you were with Will,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.880
just before the intruder
entered your room.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.590
We're making love.

05:06.510 --> 05:10.390
It's nice. It's so... It's so nice.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.480
He's falling asleep.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.530
Mmm.

05:27.820 --> 05:30.700
Good. So what happens...
What happened next?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.870
I'm awake.
I'm wide awake,

05:34.790 --> 05:39.790
and we're just
lying here.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.880
What woke you up?

06:08.030 --> 06:09.650
Oh, God!

06:09.740 --> 06:13.620
Someone stabbed him in
the chest! Oh, my God!

06:15.540 --> 06:17.870
Blood everywhere.
There's blood everywhere.

06:17.950 --> 06:20.250
Try to see his face.
Try to see his face.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.330
I can't see it.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.710
My husband!

06:22.790 --> 06:24.460
It just feels like I
can't move. I can't see it.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.500
It feels like we're
frozen. I can't see it.

06:26.590 --> 06:30.260
Abbey. Abbey, Abbey,
Abbey, Abbey. Abbey.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.010
It's all over me!
All over me.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.720
Focus on my voice.
Focus on my voice.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.970
You will be awakened and conscious

06:36.060 --> 06:37.720
in five, four, three, two, one.

06:43.060 --> 06:46.400
Abbey. Here. Let me.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.150
If I could just
see his face.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.240
He was killed, and I was right
there, Abel. I was right there.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.370
Yeah, you know, it's
as natural to feel guilt

06:59.450 --> 07:03.040
as it is unnatural to
feel it was your fault.

07:04.330 --> 07:05.830
You know that.

07:10.380 --> 07:12.050
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.650
I think you might want to
consider taking some time off.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.480
Real time, you know?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.990
Because it just might help you
find clarity with what happened.

07:34.070 --> 07:37.490
I have to continue this
study. It meant a lot to Will,

07:39.790 --> 07:42.500
and he would have
wanted me to continue.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.420
Now, why did I know
you were gonna say that?

07:45.500 --> 07:47.130
He would have wanted
me to try and finish it

07:47.210 --> 07:49.460
as soon as I could.

07:50.090 --> 07:52.840
It meant a lot to him.

08:12.780 --> 08:15.110
OSUNSANMl: And how long
had it been at this point

08:15.200 --> 08:18.280
since Will had
passed away?

08:19.240 --> 08:20.620
Two months.

08:20.870 --> 08:22.290
And you guys were
already back to school,

08:22.370 --> 08:24.000
and the kids were
already back to school?

08:24.080 --> 08:29.710
I had to try and get some
normality back into life.

08:30.630 --> 08:32.880
I didn't know
what else to do.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.140
Is Nome a place you
can drive into or...

08:43.220 --> 08:44.640
No, you have to
fly around.

08:44.730 --> 08:45.770
Okay.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.980
You can't get there by road.

09:44.910 --> 09:45.950
Any messages?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.700
No, but Scott's waiting in your office,

09:47.790 --> 09:49.370
and you have
a 1:00 and a 2:00.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.790
Thank you.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.130
So, how was it
coming in?

09:52.210 --> 09:54.090
It was
a little bumpy.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.050
You'd think as beautiful as that sky is

09:56.130 --> 09:57.510
that it wouldn't
be so rough.

09:57.590 --> 09:58.840
The stuff that
really shakes us...

09:58.930 --> 10:00.840
We seldom
ever see coming.

10:00.930 --> 10:01.970
I know, I know.

10:02.050 --> 10:03.470
It's a good saying.

10:03.550 --> 10:05.100
Not every week.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.100
Hi, Scott.
Sorry I'm late.

10:08.180 --> 10:09.810
Hey, Dr. Tyler.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.270
I flew up to Anchorage this morning,

10:13.360 --> 10:16.820
so I'm having
a bit of a slow start.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.490
Please, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.

10:30.870 --> 10:32.330
How are you?

10:32.420 --> 10:33.540
I'm all right.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.340
Have you
been sleeping?

10:37.630 --> 10:39.340
It's...
It's worse.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.930
I wake up in the middle of
the night almost every night,

10:45.300 --> 10:47.100
and I just
lie there.

10:47.470 --> 10:50.020
What time does this normally occur?

10:50.100 --> 10:52.230
Around 2:30, 3:00
in the morning.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.310
And there's nothing
unusual waking you up?

10:56.610 --> 10:58.020
No, nothing.

10:58.650 --> 11:01.360
It's just there's...
There's one thing.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.620
There's an owl
at my window.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.290
An owl?

11:16.420 --> 11:21.880
A white owl. It was just looking at me.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.510
How long
was it there?

11:29.720 --> 11:31.680
Hours.

11:31.770 --> 11:35.100
No matter what I did,
it wouldn't fly away.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.400
It wasn't
scared of me.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.570
What was it doing?

11:46.780 --> 11:48.530
Just staring at me.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.340
Had you ever
seen it before?

12:00.050 --> 12:02.260
Yeah.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.840
Once when I was a kid.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.340
That was
the first time?

12:07.430 --> 12:08.600
Uh-huh.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.720
I guess I've
seen it a lot.

12:12.810 --> 12:14.310
How much is a lot?

12:14.390 --> 12:15.560
Every night this week.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.940
Every night?

12:17.770 --> 12:21.190
You mean every time you go to bed?

12:21.280 --> 12:22.780
I think it came inside.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.860
Was your window open?

12:25.950 --> 12:27.030
No.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.700
I wonder how
it got in.

12:30.990 --> 12:34.290
I don't know, but I remember
it looking down at me.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.870
Over your bed?

12:35.960 --> 12:38.830
Yeah, I think so.
I...

12:40.130 --> 12:42.340
It's really hard
to remember.

12:44.470 --> 12:48.220
It's almost like...
Like it didn't happen.

12:49.430 --> 12:52.140
Like, you know,
in a dream.

12:54.930 --> 12:56.810
Like I just dreamt it.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.610
Can you come see me tomorrow?

13:01.480 --> 13:05.570
Sure, if you think I
should, or if it's important.

13:05.650 --> 13:09.110
Yeah, I do. I do think it's important,

13:09.200 --> 13:12.780
and it's nothing to
be alarmed at, at all,

13:14.700 --> 13:16.660
but there have been some
strange coincidences here,

13:16.750 --> 13:20.630
and I just... I feel like
I need to try something new.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.670
What do you mean?

13:22.750 --> 13:24.420
You're not the first patient I've had

13:24.510 --> 13:27.340
who's experienced
something like this.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.540
I felt so sorry
for my baby,

14:01.960 --> 14:05.250
and I feel responsible.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.510
Can you just
knock it off?

14:07.590 --> 14:09.840
Conversion disorder
is not a phenomenon

14:09.930 --> 14:12.010
that a lot of
people understand,

14:12.550 --> 14:15.390
and we've had to make
quite an adjustment.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
OSUNSANMl: when did Ashley go blind?

14:20.230 --> 14:23.150
After what
happened to will,

14:23.230 --> 14:24.860
she just
lost her sight.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.990
Hey, baby.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.330
Hi, Mommy.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.580
How was rehearsal
for the play?

14:42.210 --> 14:44.210
Hey, what's wrong?

14:44.290 --> 14:45.710
Nothing.

14:53.890 --> 14:55.090
Come on.

15:01.890 --> 15:04.440
Come on, cough it up.
What happened?

15:06.110 --> 15:08.020
Ralph called me
a faker.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.610
What? A faker?

15:11.070 --> 15:12.490
He said that I could see before,

15:12.570 --> 15:14.360
and now I was
just pretending.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.450
What a jerk.

15:15.530 --> 15:16.990
He said that I just wanted everybody

15:17.080 --> 15:20.120
to feel sorry for me because of Daddy.

15:42.890 --> 15:45.650
Dear Lord, thank you
for everything we have.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.770
Please continue
to bless our family,

15:48.320 --> 15:52.030
and please continue to help
Ashley overcome her challenges,

15:53.070 --> 15:55.110
and help
all of us to heal.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.620
In Jesus' name
we pray. Amen.

15:57.700 --> 15:58.870
Amen.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.290
Hey, what time is the game tomorrow?

16:05.370 --> 16:06.790
7:00.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.840
And who are you
playing again?

16:09.920 --> 16:11.630
I already told you,
Browerville.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.340
Well, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I must have forgot.

16:18.260 --> 16:19.890
Dad never forgot.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.850
Yeah, and Dad's
not here anymore.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.360
No, he's not.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.570
Can you
accept it yet?

16:39.660 --> 16:42.950
Okay, Ronnie, not in
front of your sister, okay?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.790
We'll talk
about it later.

16:44.870 --> 16:45.910
What do you mean?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.290
Nothing, honey.

16:49.710 --> 16:50.790
How Dad died.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.630
All right, Ronnie.
What is wrong with you?

16:52.710 --> 16:54.630
You go around helping other
people with their problems...

16:54.720 --> 16:56.130
Stop it.
Stop it!

16:56.220 --> 16:57.630
...but you can't even help yourself.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.430
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

17:01.600 --> 17:02.810
Ronnie.

17:05.099 --> 17:08.190
Mommy?
What did...

17:09.560 --> 17:11.270
What does he mean?

17:35.880 --> 17:38.300
OSUNSANMl: And do you
think he, in any way,

17:38.380 --> 17:41.140
may have blamed you for Will's death?

17:41.220 --> 17:43.010
Yes, he did blame me,

17:43.720 --> 17:48.940
and he said that
I couldn't help him

17:50.190 --> 17:53.270
or Ashley or anyone,
and he was right.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.900
A small number
continue to experience

18:33.980 --> 18:37.110
debilitating
sleep disorders,

18:37.190 --> 18:40.280
and this seems to be the
trend throughout Nome,

18:40.360 --> 18:43.410
and a cause
remains unknown.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.080
Even during the night
months, they can't sleep.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.330
We've seen over 300
people throughout Nome

18:51.790 --> 18:54.500
who are all exhibiting
the same symptoms.

18:54.590 --> 18:57.750
Around 3:00 in the morning, they
are awakened for no apparent reason,

18:57.840 --> 19:02.590
and they wake up apprehensive,
frightened, panicked,

19:03.840 --> 19:06.260
as if something's
about to happen.

19:06.850 --> 19:07.850
Whether or not
this is related...

19:07.930 --> 19:08.930
Daddy?

19:09.020 --> 19:10.980
...to the missing people
or disappearances...

19:11.060 --> 19:12.940
No, my baby,

19:13.020 --> 19:15.020
it's just a recording
of Daddy's voice.

19:17.110 --> 19:22.200
Come over here. I got
you. Come up on the bed.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.530
My angel.

19:39.630 --> 19:42.220
Okay, you're doing
real good, Tommy.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.720
When I get to one,
you will be asleep,

19:49.220 --> 19:51.560
very, very relaxed.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.900
Four, three,

19:57.480 --> 20:01.570
two and one.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.830
Can you hear me?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.580
Yes.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.920
And when was
the last time

20:22.010 --> 20:24.260
you had
trouble sleeping?

20:26.010 --> 20:27.390
Last night.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.220
And did you see the owl?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.600
Yeah.

20:39.980 --> 20:42.530
Good. And what did it look like?

20:42.610 --> 20:43.940
...what did it look like?

20:48.570 --> 20:49.740
Tommy?

20:51.290 --> 20:52.290
I...

20:54.290 --> 20:55.960
I don't remember.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.290
You don't remember
what the owl looks like?

21:00.130 --> 21:01.170
No.

21:02.090 --> 21:03.550
No, I don't see
the owl.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.550
I don't see
the owl now.

21:05.970 --> 21:06.920
It's not there
anymore.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.130
It's not
there anymore.

21:08.220 --> 21:09.220
Did it fly away?

21:09.300 --> 21:10.550
Did it fly away?

21:10.640 --> 21:11.890
No, I think it's...

21:11.970 --> 21:14.140
No,
I think it's...

21:15.480 --> 21:21.150
I don't really
remember it...

21:23.530 --> 21:27.030
...ever
being there.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.960
There's something outside
my door. It's gonna open it.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.340
The door's opening.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.880
Oh, my God.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.470
Oh, my God!

21:53.640 --> 21:55.430
No.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.850
what's wrong?

21:57.100 --> 21:58.890
Oh, Jesus! Tommy, what's wrong?

21:58.980 --> 22:00.350
No, no, no!

22:00.560 --> 22:01.940
No, no!

22:02.310 --> 22:04.110
No, no, no! No, no, no! Okay,
Tommy, when I count to three,

22:04.190 --> 22:05.190
you will awaken.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.440
No, no, no!

22:06.530 --> 22:07.690
...to conscious...
No!

22:07.780 --> 22:09.030
Three!
No!

22:09.110 --> 22:10.950
No, no! No!

22:11.030 --> 22:12.570
Three!
No!

22:14.580 --> 22:16.450
Tommy,
it's not happening.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.450
It's a memory.
This is not real.

22:18.660 --> 22:20.040
It is real.

22:26.380 --> 22:27.880
Did I do that?

22:30.220 --> 22:33.590
Yeah, you did, Tommy,
but it's okay. It's okay.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.520
What did you see?

22:40.390 --> 22:41.350
Nothing.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.520
What?

22:43.060 --> 22:45.150
Nothing.

22:45.230 --> 22:46.730
You said
you saw something.

22:49.030 --> 22:52.200
No, I didn't
see anything.

22:53.910 --> 22:54.950
I didn't
see anything.

22:55.030 --> 22:56.700
I'm just trying
to help you.

22:56.790 --> 23:01.500
If you want to help me,
get me out of this room.

23:04.960 --> 23:09.800
I need to go home. I need to
go home. I'm okay. I'm okay.

23:10.090 --> 23:13.010
Tommy, are you trying
to convince me or you?

23:14.010 --> 23:16.930
Did you see what was
bothering you at night?

23:18.720 --> 23:20.470
Did you see the owl?

23:30.070 --> 23:33.610
Can we talk about this next time?

23:35.280 --> 23:37.490
Yeah, of course.
Sure.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.290
Talk to me
when you need to.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.290
Yeah. Okay.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.050
Call in EMTs, Search,
everybody. I want everybody.

24:31.130 --> 24:35.010
Transfer me into that house. Right now.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.520
Tommy here.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.440
Yeah, what's going on in there?

24:48.650 --> 24:50.020
I want to talk
to Abbey Tyler.

24:50.110 --> 24:51.320
Abbey?

24:51.400 --> 24:53.780
Abbey's not here right now,
but I can help you.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.360
I have to
talk to her!

25:00.490 --> 25:01.530
Hello?

25:01.620 --> 25:03.490
I need you down
here at Tommy's house.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.290
August?
He's gone crazy.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.710
He's holding his family
hostage, and he's asking for you.

25:07.830 --> 25:09.500
Okay, I'll be
right there.

25:23.010 --> 25:23.970
Bring her up here.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.100
She's here right now.

25:25.180 --> 25:27.350
We'll walk her up to you, okay,
Tommy? It's gonna be all right.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.600
Just give her the phone. Give her
the phone. I want to talk to her.

25:29.730 --> 25:31.650
Both arms out. Both
arms out. She's here.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.150
Put her on the phone right now.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.110
I'm gonna do it right now,
okay? Is this really necessary?

25:35.240 --> 25:37.150
I want to talk to her! Can
somebody tell me what's going on?

25:37.240 --> 25:38.200
Where is she? Take it easy, all right?

25:38.320 --> 25:40.820
I don't see her. Get her up
here! August, what's going on?

25:40.910 --> 25:43.990
I need you to calm him down
and get him thinking rationally.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.250
He's got Sarah, Timothy and Joe lined up

25:46.330 --> 25:48.620
in the kitchen with
a gun to their heads,

25:48.710 --> 25:51.000
and he wants to talk to you
for some reason, all right?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.080
Watch your step.

25:52.170 --> 25:53.500
Straight this way.

25:53.590 --> 25:58.010
Tommy? Tommy, what...
What's going on here?

25:58.970 --> 26:01.590
I'm so sorry,
but I've gotta do this.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.850
I don't have
a choice.

26:04.930 --> 26:10.310
It was completely surreal to be
there in the middle of the night

26:10.980 --> 26:13.190
with all those
police trucks.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.480
I don't have
a choice.

26:14.570 --> 26:15.940
No, no, no. You have a choice, Tommy.

26:16.030 --> 26:17.360
We always
have a choice.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.150
Not this time.
Please, Tommy!

26:19.240 --> 26:21.200
Yes. Yes, you do.
You have the choice

26:21.280 --> 26:23.740
right now to just... To just stop.

26:23.830 --> 26:26.540
Just put down
the gun, Tommy.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.460
You have it within
your power to just stop.

26:29.540 --> 26:31.620
Please, before
somebody gets hurt.

26:31.710 --> 26:33.790
Tommy, look at
Sarah, Tommy.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.340
Look at...
Look at your wife.

26:36.090 --> 26:37.210
Look at your
children, Tommy.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.300
It's okay.
It's okay.

26:38.380 --> 26:40.630
You would never let
anything happen to them.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.090
You love them
so much.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.390
I know what keeps us up at night.

26:44.470 --> 26:47.930
And if you saw
what I saw,

26:48.020 --> 26:49.140
you would
understand.

26:49.230 --> 26:51.190
What did you
see, Tommy?

26:51.600 --> 26:53.060
It doesn't matter,
because we're not gonna

26:53.150 --> 26:55.810
have to see it
ever again.

26:56.070 --> 26:59.070
Just wait, Tommy.
I can help you.

26:59.190 --> 27:02.280
Just talk to me, okay? We'll
talk as long as you need to.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.610
We'll get
through this, Tommy.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.410
If anybody's got a
clear shot, take it now.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.580
Negative.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.660
I don't have a clear shot,
sir. The wife is blocking him.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.790
And he wasn't
listening to me.

27:09.870 --> 27:11.040
Do you know what
Zimabu Eter means?

27:11.120 --> 27:12.210
And they were
going to kill him.

27:12.290 --> 27:15.080
What? Wait. I can't
hear you, Tommy. What?

27:15.170 --> 27:16.460
Has anybody
got the shot?

27:16.540 --> 27:20.050
Zimabu Eter! Zimabu Eter! Zimabu Eter!

27:20.130 --> 27:21.260
What the hell
does that mean?

27:21.550 --> 27:23.590
Zimabu Eter? I don't know, Tommy.
What the hell does that mean?

27:23.680 --> 27:24.680
Anybody got
the goddamn shot?

27:24.760 --> 27:26.680
But I can find out. Just
give me a little time.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.930
I need to know now!

27:28.010 --> 27:29.140
Just give me
a little time.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.060
I will find out for you.
I promise. Right now!

27:31.140 --> 27:32.270
No, please!

27:32.350 --> 27:33.440
You can't help me.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.980
I love you.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.110
Move, move!

27:41.190 --> 27:43.150
Move, move, move!

27:43.280 --> 27:45.240
Tommy! God damn it!

28:14.270 --> 28:16.900
I'm having a hard time

28:16.980 --> 28:18.270
understanding what
happened here.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.570
I know. I know.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.650
You don't know what he saw? So
you have no idea what he saw?

28:24.780 --> 28:26.110
He didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.990
What did
he tell you?

28:31.200 --> 28:35.120
That what he thought
he saw wasn't an owl.

28:35.210 --> 28:36.460
That it was
something else.

28:37.250 --> 28:40.130
And that's what was
keeping him up at night?

28:40.750 --> 28:41.880
Yeah.

28:44.090 --> 28:47.260
So he was under hypnosis
when he saw this?

28:50.600 --> 28:51.680
Yeah.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.810
And how do you know
what he saw was real?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.480
I don't know
that it was.

28:57.650 --> 28:59.860
So what you're saying is that
Tommy might have done all of this

28:59.940 --> 29:02.150
based on something
that was imaginary.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.660
All I know is that he
believed what he saw,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.580
and there was more fear in his eyes

29:15.660 --> 29:17.870
than I've ever
seen in my life.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.090
Had you not
hypnotized him,

29:21.170 --> 29:23.000
do you think he would have done this?

29:26.130 --> 29:27.800
What do you mean?

29:28.890 --> 29:30.680
I'm just
wondering,

29:30.760 --> 29:31.970
without this
hypnotism,

29:33.140 --> 29:36.520
do you think he still would
have murdered his family?

29:41.480 --> 29:44.980
That is a ridiculous
and offensive question.

29:45.110 --> 29:47.240
No, what's ridiculous and offensive

29:47.320 --> 29:49.280
is that an entire family
is lying in a morgue

29:49.360 --> 29:51.120
from a murder-suicide,

29:51.200 --> 29:52.280
and the last
meaningful contact

29:52.370 --> 29:54.490
that the murderer
had was with you.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.040
No, what
happened tonight

29:56.120 --> 29:58.660
would have manifested itself eventually.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.670
He was suppressing
something.

30:02.210 --> 30:03.750
Look, in 13 years
of practice,

30:03.840 --> 30:07.170
I've never witnessed
something to this extent.

30:07.510 --> 30:09.840
Abbey, why didn't
you contact us

30:10.680 --> 30:12.550
if you suspected
he was unstable

30:12.680 --> 30:14.600
after an admittedly
violent episode?

30:14.680 --> 30:17.680
He was completely coherent
when he left my office.

30:17.770 --> 30:20.190
Now, I had no reason to suspect...

30:20.400 --> 30:22.060
I called his wife to ask
her to keep an eye on him.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.860
And now
she's dead.

30:29.860 --> 30:32.610
Okay, I'm not going
to sit here and listen

30:32.700 --> 30:35.280
to how hypnosis-induced
murder caused this.

30:35.370 --> 30:37.240
Jesus, I am trying to find
out... This is ridiculous.

30:37.330 --> 30:41.040
...what caused one of the worst
murders in the history of Nome.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.830
There's something going on in
this town that we don't understand.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.340
There's something happening
to people in their sleep...

30:46.420 --> 30:47.960
Well, I don't know
about any of that!

30:48.050 --> 30:49.840
I don't understand what
you're talking about!

30:49.920 --> 30:51.340
I don't deal
in hallucinations.

30:51.430 --> 30:53.220
I don't deal in the
visions in the ether.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.600
What in the hell are you talking about?

30:54.680 --> 30:56.350
I'm dealing in real
flesh and blood things,

30:56.430 --> 30:58.890
four of whom are lying
on slabs next door.

30:58.980 --> 31:01.060
How dare you? My husband was
lying on one of those slabs

31:01.140 --> 31:02.310
and you still
haven't found his killer.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.190
Abbey, now, you know damn
well what happened to Will.

31:04.270 --> 31:05.310
That case is closed.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.820
No, you cannot
file things away

31:06.900 --> 31:08.320
without getting to
what really happened.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.610
Now, there are more unsolved
murders and missing people in Nome...

31:11.740 --> 31:13.490
Sit down. ...than any
other town in Alaska,

31:13.570 --> 31:16.030
three years of which have
been under your watch.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.330
Now, what is happening
in this town is very real,

31:18.410 --> 31:19.450
and it must be
acknowledged.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.120
Sit down!

31:31.220 --> 31:33.840
You stop whatever this
governmental study is,

31:33.930 --> 31:35.800
this hypnosis,
whatever it is,

31:35.890 --> 31:37.680
whatever you and
Will were after.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.390
It's bringing nothing but bad
news to a town that's had enough.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.850
Now, I don't care how
important it is to you.

31:41.940 --> 31:45.190
I don't care how hard you've
worked on it. I don't care.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.770
You're not gonna use the people
of Nome for a goddamn rat study.

32:01.790 --> 32:04.670
I felt responsible for...

32:06.460 --> 32:08.710
...death,
and his family's.

32:10.630 --> 32:13.340
And at the time, after
all that happened,

32:13.420 --> 32:16.300
I still didn't know why he did it.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.810
All of the patients
reported seeing the same owl,

32:24.690 --> 32:30.570
but Tommy mentioned that his
memory of the owl was wrong

32:32.320 --> 32:35.700
and that he didn't
see it anymore.

32:35.780 --> 32:39.070
It was some sort of
false recollection.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.210
The question is,

32:47.170 --> 32:50.540
if under hypnosis, will the
others feel the same way?

32:54.420 --> 32:56.470
Will they see
what he saw?

33:01.720 --> 33:04.470
We have to proceed
with extreme caution.

33:06.140 --> 33:11.270
What happened here remains
unexplained, like Will.

33:29.710 --> 33:30.710
Abel?

33:30.790 --> 33:34.710
I heard what happened. I just
wanted to make sure you were okay.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.590
Hey. You flew all the way up here?

33:36.670 --> 33:38.300
That's all right.
That's okay.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.890
I'm worried
about you.

33:39.970 --> 33:41.350
You didn't have to. I'm fine.

33:41.430 --> 33:42.850
Yeah?
Yeah.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.270
You want to talk?

33:45.350 --> 33:47.310
I can't. I can't cancel my schedule.

33:47.520 --> 33:51.150
Theresa, good morning. Can you
transcribe this for me, please?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.520
Do you want me to
cancel your meetings?

33:52.610 --> 33:54.940
No, no. Thank you.

33:55.070 --> 33:56.820
So, how you feeling?

33:59.740 --> 34:01.370
I feel like I just need to start my day.

34:01.450 --> 34:02.870
Yeah.

34:03.410 --> 34:05.790
Maybe it's...
You think it's

34:05.870 --> 34:07.790
time that you, maybe, stepped back?

34:09.710 --> 34:12.830
Maybe consider
it a sabbatical?

34:12.920 --> 34:14.710
I love that word.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.380
It doesn't actually sound like
what it means, which is "time off."

34:17.469 --> 34:20.300
Abbey, listen, you need to
step away for perspective,

34:20.389 --> 34:22.260
clarity on
what's happened.

34:23.219 --> 34:27.020
I mean, you can't
continue like this.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.100
No, I can,
and I have to.

34:30.730 --> 34:33.610
It's the only thing
I have within my power.

34:33.690 --> 34:36.820
It's all I have left, is to continue,

34:36.900 --> 34:38.489
to find out what's
causing all of this.

34:39.780 --> 34:41.610
I can't...
I don't...

34:42.070 --> 34:46.120
I don't believe that it can be
just chalked up to coincidence,

34:46.330 --> 34:48.500
what happened to Will, what
happened to Tommy and his family.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.330
I don't.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.630
Not in this town.

34:53.750 --> 34:56.040
Do you mind
if I stay on a bit?

34:56.130 --> 34:57.800
Just kept an eye
on you,

34:58.630 --> 35:01.680
since you're not too
keen on doing it yourself?

35:04.640 --> 35:05.680
It's all right.

35:16.190 --> 35:18.480
So, lots to
talk about.

35:18.570 --> 35:20.440
What happened to Tommy?

35:20.530 --> 35:21.570
I can't discuss...

35:21.650 --> 35:26.030
He's dead. You should be
able to discuss everything.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.240
It had
something...

35:29.330 --> 35:34.420
I believe that it had something
to do with his sleeping habits.

35:36.210 --> 35:39.340
We're really worried,
obviously.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.300
It's the second suicide
in a couple of months.

35:45.340 --> 35:46.720
I understand.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.510
We want you to
hypnotize me, too.

35:50.890 --> 35:54.100
We need to know if there's
anything I'm not remembering,

35:54.190 --> 35:56.310
and I feel...

35:56.400 --> 35:59.570
We feel like the best
thing to do is to face it.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.150
We've already
thought it over.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.450
If you want to
undergo this,

36:13.290 --> 36:17.710
we're gonna have to go
about this very delicately.

36:19.840 --> 36:24.420
Would it be all right if a
colleague of mine, Dr. Campos,

36:25.180 --> 36:27.890
came in
to observe?

36:27.970 --> 36:29.050
Yeah, sure.

36:32.310 --> 36:33.310
Okay.

36:36.350 --> 36:41.400
Five. Deeper, deeper.
You're totally relaxed.

36:42.490 --> 36:47.410
Four, three,
two and one.

36:48.030 --> 36:51.330
So, when was the last time
you had trouble sleeping?

36:52.250 --> 36:53.580
Last night.

36:56.620 --> 37:00.590
And do you remember seeing
anything unusual last night?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.130
An owl.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.470
Tell me about
the owl.

37:12.140 --> 37:14.020
Tell me about the owl.

37:15.690 --> 37:19.940
It's a beige owl.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.690
Its eyes are big,
like...

37:26.950 --> 37:31.240
I don't know. It doesn't
look like a normal owl.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.740
It doesn't look
like a normal owl.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.460
Scott?

37:42.670 --> 37:45.170
There is no owl.
It's not...

37:45.590 --> 37:47.920
Honey, honey,
honey, wake up.

37:49.430 --> 37:52.850
You hear that?
wake up.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.310
She's not...
She's not waking up.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.650
Someone's outside
the door.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.120
Tell me
what you see.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.580
Something's out there.

38:17.660 --> 38:19.250
Can you see
who it is?

38:19.540 --> 38:25.090
Not who, what.
I know what they are.

38:26.510 --> 38:29.840
They come all the time
since I was little.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.050
What are they?

38:35.510 --> 38:37.680
They're gonna
open the door.

38:40.230 --> 38:43.060
They get in without
setting off the alarm.

38:43.810 --> 38:46.360
I armed it. I know... I know I did.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.860
I thought they only come
when I think about them,

38:52.950 --> 38:55.530
but I wasn't thinking
about them tonight.

39:08.130 --> 39:11.680
Okay, Scott, I'm gonna count to
three, and you're gonna wake up.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.010
One, two, three!

39:14.760 --> 39:18.850
Scott! Scott!
Scott, wake up!

39:44.130 --> 39:46.080
Here you go.
Go ahead.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.220
I'm sorry.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.600
It's unbelievable.

40:08.820 --> 40:10.860
It doesn't
make any sense.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.530
Scott, you don't
have to rush.

40:14.610 --> 40:17.950
Whenever you're ready, you
can tell us what you saw.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.120
I saw them.

40:23.830 --> 40:26.080
Who's them?

40:26.170 --> 40:27.500
They're not
from here.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.380
What do you mean?

40:32.800 --> 40:36.300
I can't describe it. I can't
see what's in my own mind.

40:37.970 --> 40:39.800
I can't control it.

40:41.310 --> 40:43.770
All I can see is the owl, but I...

40:44.230 --> 40:47.190
I know it's not an owl, but I...

40:48.270 --> 40:53.990
I remember the smell, like
a... Like a putrid cinnamon.

40:55.490 --> 40:57.950
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

41:01.580 --> 41:02.700
The worst part

41:02.790 --> 41:06.410
was the voice inside my head, like...

41:07.290 --> 41:11.380
'Cause they
talk to you

41:11.460 --> 41:13.170
so you can hear them, but...

41:14.510 --> 41:17.510
They also talk
inside your mind,

41:17.590 --> 41:19.340
like you're connected or something.

41:21.470 --> 41:24.890
And they take me away to
somewhere, but I can't remember,

41:25.060 --> 41:26.430
and I can't remember
what they do to me.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.560
Okay, okay, Scott,
that's enough for today.

41:32.780 --> 41:34.110
I'm so sorry.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.490
It's gonna
be all right.

41:35.610 --> 41:39.110
Cindy, under
the circumstances,

41:39.200 --> 41:40.910
I'm going to
contact Sheriff August

41:40.990 --> 41:42.620
to let him know
that we've met

41:42.700 --> 41:44.540
and let him know that
we've had this session.

41:44.620 --> 41:46.200
Yeah, please do.

41:48.210 --> 41:49.330
Okay.

41:52.170 --> 41:54.670
Now, I know why... did what he did.

41:57.510 --> 41:58.550
Why?

41:58.970 --> 42:02.350
You'd have to
have seen it,

42:02.430 --> 42:05.060
felt it,
what it is.

42:06.390 --> 42:07.930
What is it?

42:08.190 --> 42:09.730
The worst.

42:09.810 --> 42:11.100
Of what?

42:12.690 --> 42:15.480
That you could... You
could ever imagine.

42:20.490 --> 42:25.200
Come on. Babe, let's go home.

42:29.830 --> 42:31.460
We're going home.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.890
What the hell
was that?

42:44.970 --> 42:46.010
Abel.

42:46.100 --> 42:47.180
Hmm?

42:49.390 --> 42:53.860
Do you believe in
abduction theories?

42:53.940 --> 42:56.190
What do you mean,
like kidnappings?

42:56.280 --> 43:01.530
Yeah.
No. No, not...

43:02.450 --> 43:07.290
Not kidnappings,
but abduction, as in...

43:08.950 --> 43:10.870
You don't mean alien abductions, do you?

43:10.960 --> 43:14.670
Well, you know, I think that
might be what we just heard.

43:14.750 --> 43:16.790
When you look at the statistics,
they're pretty impressive.

43:16.880 --> 43:20.880
I mean, Will was kind of into
that, and he did a little research.

43:21.050 --> 43:23.430
You know, there are
over 11 million people

43:23.510 --> 43:25.180
that have either
reported seeing

43:25.260 --> 43:29.310
or know someone who has
seen U FOs since the 1930s.

43:29.560 --> 43:33.190
The idea of any of this stuff
being real is... You can't...

43:33.270 --> 43:35.060
Come on, Abel. I mean, when something

43:35.150 --> 43:37.400
boasts 11 million
witnesses...

43:37.480 --> 43:40.530
You know, that would win
any court case in the world.

43:40.610 --> 43:42.450
Well, and there are just as many

43:42.530 --> 43:44.320
explanations
and reasons.

43:47.660 --> 43:53.040
Weather balloons, atmospheric
effects, optical illusions.

43:53.670 --> 43:56.830
In this case, perhaps,
hypnocognic hallucinations.

43:58.750 --> 44:02.090
Listen, we have to deal
with hard, empirical evidence

44:02.170 --> 44:04.010
and facts.
We can't...

44:06.050 --> 44:08.680
Abbey! Abbey.
The tape.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.100
The tape you gave
me this morning...

44:10.180 --> 44:11.640
Wait. Slow down.
Slow down, Theresa.

44:11.730 --> 44:14.190
What is it?
Did you listen to it?

44:19.280 --> 44:21.820
I don't... I don't know what this is.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.400
I don't know
what's going on.

44:27.030 --> 44:28.740
I don't want to
listen to it again.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.160
That was weird.

45:34.060 --> 45:35.220
Abbey?

46:12.300 --> 46:13.640
That's you?

46:15.930 --> 46:17.680
That's not
my voice.

46:21.230 --> 46:22.730
That's not me.

46:30.780 --> 46:32.240
OSUNSANMl: After you heard
that, what did you, like...

46:32.320 --> 46:33.950
How did you react?

46:34.030 --> 46:35.740
After the initial shock,

46:36.830 --> 46:40.080
I was in denial.

46:41.210 --> 46:43.840
It couldn't be me,
my voice.

46:47.210 --> 46:49.670
So, what
happened next?

46:51.390 --> 46:55.600
I went through what I could hold onto.

46:55.890 --> 46:57.010
Which were
what?

46:57.100 --> 46:58.600
Which were the facts.

47:01.020 --> 47:03.980
I went home to
try and recount

47:04.060 --> 47:06.150
what happened during the recording.

47:33.930 --> 47:36.260
I was sleeping
in my bed

47:36.350 --> 47:37.350
when my door opened.

47:50.990 --> 47:54.780
Someone or something came into my room.

48:02.370 --> 48:04.420
Did it cause
that somehow?

48:05.710 --> 48:08.670
Some kind of
allergic reaction?

48:08.750 --> 48:09.880
How long had it
been there?

48:10.760 --> 48:14.590
But whatever, whoever
it was, I fought it.

48:16.930 --> 48:19.850
But it was too strong,
and it took me away.

48:21.430 --> 48:23.770
The moment
it became too real

48:23.850 --> 48:26.400
was when I looked down
at the floorboards

48:27.190 --> 48:31.150
and I saw scratches leading
all the way to the door.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.490
I put myself
back together.

48:38.370 --> 48:42.290
I was determined to
figure out what it was,

48:42.960 --> 48:44.870
what came
into my room,

48:45.580 --> 48:48.540
what it was saying,
where it took me,

48:50.420 --> 48:52.300
and what it
did to me.

48:52.550 --> 48:56.130
I listened to that
tape over and over

48:57.800 --> 49:01.600
to figure out anything,

49:03.310 --> 49:08.480
something to
explain what it was.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.690
It wasn't Latin.

49:12.820 --> 49:14.440
It wasn't Greek.

49:15.820 --> 49:18.860
It wasn't any language
that I had heard before,

49:20.660 --> 49:25.500
and I felt
it was the key

49:26.160 --> 49:29.170
to everything
that was happening

49:30.670 --> 49:33.750
to me, to Will,

49:35.170 --> 49:37.220
and everyone else
in Nome.

49:39.180 --> 49:43.350
And then I found exactly
what I was looking for.

50:12.790 --> 50:14.550
Hello?
Hello.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.130
Is this Dr...

50:18.220 --> 50:20.090
Awolowa Odusami.

50:20.180 --> 50:21.800
Yes, this is he.

50:21.890 --> 50:23.470
Hi, I was wondering,

50:23.560 --> 50:27.560
are you familiar with a
person named Dr. William Tyler?

50:28.270 --> 50:30.190
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.

50:32.980 --> 50:33.980
Okay.

50:34.070 --> 50:35.320
May I ask
who's speaking?

50:38.950 --> 50:40.070
I'm...

50:40.160 --> 50:41.360
will you tell me
your name?

51:11.810 --> 51:13.350
Hello?
Listen,

51:13.770 --> 51:16.020
there was a man who
called me from this number.

51:16.110 --> 51:17.980
He called himself John.

51:19.610 --> 51:21.030
There's no John here.

51:21.110 --> 51:22.450
Exactly, I know.

51:24.950 --> 51:29.160
What was he... Why was he calling you?

51:30.160 --> 51:34.790
He wanted to have a history
lesson on ancient languages.

51:40.130 --> 51:41.470
Look, I...

51:43.590 --> 51:47.640
That was my husband
that you talked to,

51:48.720 --> 51:52.140
and he's been murdered.

51:52.230 --> 51:53.270
Dr...

51:53.350 --> 51:55.480
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry to hear that.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.060
...he
listened to me.

51:57.150 --> 51:58.110
Yeah.

51:58.190 --> 52:00.230
He didn't
judge me

52:00.320 --> 52:02.780
or try to
analyze me.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.200
I just...
I need...

52:04.280 --> 52:05.820
He just listened.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.200
I need you
to hear me out.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.870
And then he flew over to Nome.

52:36.770 --> 52:38.310
I thought it was Akkadian, but it's not.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.730
It's Sumerian.
I'm sure of it.

52:40.820 --> 52:42.280
This is widely considered by my peers

52:42.360 --> 52:45.490
to be the Holy Grail of dead languages,

52:46.030 --> 52:49.030
but we haven't deciphered
the entire lexicon.

52:57.460 --> 52:58.830
"Our creation" is
the last two words.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.590
I'm not sure of
the first two.

53:06.130 --> 53:08.260
"Examine" is
the first word.

53:15.390 --> 53:17.600
The last word is
"ruin" or "destroy."

53:20.190 --> 53:25.280
"Our creation," "examine,"
"ruin," or "destroy."

53:27.160 --> 53:28.740
Ruin, destroy who?

53:28.820 --> 53:30.160
It's an incomplete
translation.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.040
We can't be sure of
exactly what's being said.

53:33.120 --> 53:34.660
But whatever it is,
it sounds aggressive.

53:34.750 --> 53:38.580
I'm sorry, but none of
this is making any sense.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.130
It's a
verbalized recording

53:41.210 --> 53:43.380
of the Sumerian
language.

53:43.460 --> 53:45.880
Now, we're talking about the
oldest language in human history

53:45.970 --> 53:48.800
for whatever reason
recorded in your room.

53:49.260 --> 53:51.220
What was happening?
What was being done to me?

53:51.300 --> 53:54.470
What is unsettling is
that whatever it is,

53:56.140 --> 53:58.440
the vocals,
they don't sound...

54:00.440 --> 54:02.110
Ordinary.
Human?

54:03.230 --> 54:05.730
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

54:06.530 --> 54:09.530
Okay? Let's not fuel
any more of these fires.

54:11.490 --> 54:13.530
Now, there's
any number of reasons

54:13.620 --> 54:16.450
for the distortion
in the voice.

54:16.790 --> 54:19.290
I'm not jumping
to any conclusions,

54:21.130 --> 54:22.670
but her voice
sounded fine.

54:22.750 --> 54:26.010
The tape could have been
recorded over, for one,

54:26.090 --> 54:27.760
and part of the old tape
could still be heard.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.050
No, I don't
recycle tapes.

54:29.130 --> 54:31.050
Well, maybe
this time you did.

54:31.140 --> 54:32.390
And that still
does not explain

54:32.470 --> 54:34.600
why that voice is
speaking a language

54:34.680 --> 54:37.060
that predates
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

54:37.680 --> 54:40.600
Now, I've studied the Sumerian
civilization for most of my career,

54:40.690 --> 54:45.320
and what I have
found is intriguing.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.870
You can go into
any Sumerian exhibit

54:52.950 --> 54:55.240
and see what I am
about to tell you.

54:55.330 --> 54:59.330
Drawings of rockets that look
like Apollo launching into the sky.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.420
Etchings and sculptures
of men in spacesuits

55:02.500 --> 55:04.840
and what look
like oxygen masks.

55:05.880 --> 55:09.840
And this artwork was created in
the fourth millennium B.C. E.,

55:09.930 --> 55:11.930
4,000 years before
Christ walked the Earth.

55:12.010 --> 55:14.600
"Genesis," Noah's ark, to name a few.

55:14.680 --> 55:16.470
Both of these stories
existed in Sumer

55:16.560 --> 55:18.560
6,000 years before
the Bible was written.

55:18.640 --> 55:21.310
"Genesis" came from the
Sumerian epic of creation.

55:21.390 --> 55:24.190
Noah's ark came from
the Sumerian deluge.

55:24.360 --> 55:26.440
The alien-god legend
has its basis,

55:26.520 --> 55:29.400
its origins,
in Sumerian history.

55:30.320 --> 55:33.240
You can find everything I've
described in a museum right now.

55:35.740 --> 55:40.330
You know, it is one thing
to entertain wild theories,

55:43.120 --> 55:45.960
but quite another
to invest in them.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.920
Yes, and you're entitled
to that reaction,

55:49.010 --> 55:51.340
but as I said from the
beginning, I draw no conclusions.

55:51.420 --> 55:52.800
I'm dealing in facts.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.840
Now, this is drawn
from thousands of years

55:54.930 --> 55:57.390
of data research
and collection.

55:58.060 --> 55:59.810
How this is put together
is open to debate.

56:01.430 --> 56:03.770
Do you honestly
believe you were forcibly

56:03.850 --> 56:05.600
removed
from your bedroom

56:06.020 --> 56:08.150
by members of
an alien race?

56:15.030 --> 56:16.870
Hello? Abbey, can you
come over? It's Scott.

56:16.950 --> 56:18.830
Something's wrong. He wants
you to come over. He...

56:18.910 --> 56:21.950
Cindy? Hold on a second.
Just take a deep breath.

56:51.780 --> 56:52.940
Hi, Cindy.
Hey.

56:53.030 --> 56:55.240
This is Dr. Odusami.
He's here to help.

56:55.320 --> 56:56.360
Good morning.

56:56.450 --> 56:57.490
Come in.

57:02.290 --> 57:03.250
Scott?

57:03.330 --> 57:04.370
What took you
so long?

57:04.460 --> 57:06.870
I'm sorry. I came as quick as I could.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.880
Last night was...

57:08.960 --> 57:10.040
Calm down.

57:10.130 --> 57:11.500
Calm down?
Scott.

57:11.590 --> 57:12.710
How can I?
You don't...

57:12.800 --> 57:14.470
Scott. Scott, I'm here, all right?

57:14.550 --> 57:17.510
Now, you've gotta try and breathe
for me. You have to calm yourself,

57:17.590 --> 57:20.350
because I cannot help you
if you're all wound up.

57:20.430 --> 57:22.600
I don't want to talk
about it, but I have to.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.390
Have to, have to,
have to...

57:25.480 --> 57:26.810
I have to, I have to,
I have to...

57:27.810 --> 57:29.310
Scott, why are you...

57:29.400 --> 57:30.650
I have to.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.860
What is this?
How did you get this?

57:34.940 --> 57:38.200
I don't know. I didn't
know it was there. I just...

57:39.370 --> 57:42.080
Okay. Can we set up
the camera, please?

57:42.870 --> 57:44.240
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't need anyone...

57:44.330 --> 57:45.660
I don't want
this getting out.

57:45.750 --> 57:48.080
Scott, we need to
record what's happening.

57:48.170 --> 57:49.830
We need to record
this session for study,

57:49.920 --> 57:52.840
so we can find out
what's going on with you.

57:53.590 --> 57:55.880
Okay, I don't want to go under.

57:57.010 --> 57:58.590
Well, we don't have to do that.

57:58.680 --> 58:01.100
Just try and relay
whatever you remember.

58:02.010 --> 58:05.930
There's things I have
to remember, but I...

58:06.850 --> 58:10.020
But I can't.
I can't without...

58:10.730 --> 58:14.360
You know what? We can put you
under a very light hypnosis.

58:15.030 --> 58:16.150
Okay?

58:16.400 --> 58:17.990
But if
you're worried...

58:18.070 --> 58:19.280
I have to.
I have to remember.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.240
I have to get
this out of my head.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.330
It feels like it's
just dug in there

58:24.410 --> 58:26.580
and I can't think
straight anymore.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.250
It's okay.
It's okay.

58:30.330 --> 58:31.540
I have to...

58:32.840 --> 58:34.130
I'll do it.

58:34.210 --> 58:35.250
Are you sure?

58:35.340 --> 58:36.380
Yeah.

58:37.760 --> 58:38.880
Okay.

58:40.590 --> 58:42.050
Are we ready?

58:44.010 --> 58:45.010
Okay.

58:49.890 --> 58:51.520
It's okay.
Okay?

58:54.070 --> 58:55.730
Relax.
Just relax.

58:57.740 --> 59:00.900
There's a lot of people
in the room with you now.

59:00.990 --> 59:02.410
You're not alone.

59:03.830 --> 59:04.990
Relax.

59:06.290 --> 59:10.160
By the time I reach one,
you will be asleep.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.500
Five, four,

59:15.840 --> 59:18.800
three, two,

59:21.090 --> 59:22.180
one.

59:48.490 --> 59:49.540
Scott?

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.010
But where are
we going?

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:44.300
North Carolina.

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.340
North Carolina?
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.640
What's in
North Carolina?

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.890
Us, by tomorrow.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:50.180
But I have
a game tomorrow.

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.180
Pack your bags.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.940
Hello? I don't think she feels
like talking to you right now.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.730
Mommy?
Yeah, baby.

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.820
What's wrong?

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.150
Nothing, sweetie.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.320
We're just gonna go take
a little break, okay?

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.450
It's Abel.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.490
Tell him
I'll call him back.

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:08.570
She'll call you back.

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.620
He says he has to talk to
you. I'll call you back, Abel.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.580
He's already
on his way.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.580
Are we gonna see Grandma and Grandpa?

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.870
No, baby, Grandma and
Grandpa are gone, remember?

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.210
Yeah, they're with Daddy.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.960
I mean Grandpa
and Grandma Lilly.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.760
No, we're not going
to see them, either.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.510
But why not?

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:30.140
Baby, I'm just gonna
sit you down right here,

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.640
and you've gotta let Mommy
pack, okay? Thank you.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.730
It's 'cause
of Dad, huh?

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:40.730
Ronnie, I really need you
to help me right now, okay?

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.030
Please take your
sister into her room

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.240
and help her
get ready, okay?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.740
Thank you.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:51.160
Mom?

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.330
Yeah?

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.580
What did you do?

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.750
Hold on!

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.010
What happened
to Scott?

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.090
August, I'm sorry.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:07.920
He's paralyzed
from the neck down.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:11.720
Three of the vertebrate in his
neck are completely severed!

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:13.100
Huh?

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:14.930
I don't know.
Huh?

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.020
You were there.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.180
I can't explain it.
I can't...

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:18.310
Tell me
what happened.

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:20.020
How'd he
break his back?

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.070
I put him under, and
there was something...

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:25.780
Something was
inside of him

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.820
that twisted his body,
and that...

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.610
Something was
inside of him,

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.200
and it twisted
his body?

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.200
And you have
proof of this?

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.870
It didn't record.
It was all distorted.

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:38.210
Abbey...

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.340
How in God's name am I
supposed to believe this?

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.460
I know what I saw.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:45.840
Yeah, what you saw?

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.170
I know what I saw.
What you saw?

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.170
Abbey, what you're
doing is hurting people,

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.930
very obviously!

01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:52.890
Now, my heart goes out
to you, it really does,

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:54.300
what you've been through.
I understand that,

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:56.430
but you leave me
no choice.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.810
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:58.890
What?

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.390
Anything you say
or do can and will

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.060
be held against you
in a court of law.

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:03.900
No, stop. Stop.

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:05.190
You have the right to an attorney.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:06.270
August.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.400
August, please,
don't do this.

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:11.320
Ryan!
Sheriff, no.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:14.320
Ryan, you can't.
Please. You can't...

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:18.250
You can't take me away from my
children. August, please, don't.

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:21.290
August. August, I know
what this looks like.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.420
I know what this looks
like, but I was there.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.960
I saw it.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:28.760
You were there,
and you saw what?

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.300
What did you see?

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.680
Well, it's the kind
of thing that...

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:35.300
Well, you'd have
to have seen it.

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:36.930
No. Bullshit.

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.390
Now, this woman is not
capable of committing

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.560
any physical harm
to any man.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.190
I don't know what
she is capable of...

01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.020
She's not capable. You
know. You know. Hey!

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:47.770
Just calm down for a
second and hear me out.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.530
I know that what's happening
here in Nome is frightening.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:52.700
I know it is.

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:55.320
But whatever you do,
you cannot arrest her

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:56.450
for something you
don't understand

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:58.540
just because you're terrified. Come on.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.580
You're pushing it.
You're pushing it.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.790
I mean, I was there. I saw it.

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:04.460
Now you're gonna take
her away from her children

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.000
for something
that she did not do.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.130
Come on.
Come on.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:09.340
Let's just calm down.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.960
Please. Please.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.340
You will be under
24-hour supervision,

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:17.930
and you will not
leave these premises.

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:22.310
If you touch that
doorknob, I will arrest you!

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.480
I understand.
Thank you.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.940
You're coming
with me.

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:33.780
Thank you.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.330
Hey, look after your mom.
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.460
Ronnie.

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:20.120
This is Ryan, sir. I'm stationed
in front of the Tyler home.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.200
Over.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:22.660
Roger that.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.130
But they said they were
questioned by Chief...

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.810
...reminded him about
the disappearances...

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.430
OSUNSANMl:
What about them?

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.980
Homicides,
missing people.

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:49.230
Dozens of them.

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:52.110
It's been happening
there since the 1960s,

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.110
and the FBI have been
dropping in from time to time.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.240
Would you say...

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.320
OSUNSANMl:
what did they find?

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:02.370
Nothing.
It's inconclusive.

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:06.290
To this day,
nothing has been solved.

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.210
what do you think
it means?

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:11.000
How do you put it in perspective?

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:15.760
They have
different categories

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.970
for these types
of things.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.090
Different levels.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.890
An encounter of
the first kind,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.600
that's when you
see a UFO.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:32.150
The second kind is when
you see evidence of it:

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.030
crop circles,
radiation.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.030
The third kind is when you make contact.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.530
But the fourth kind,

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:49.040
there's nothing more
frightening than the fourth.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:56.090
You see, that one is
when they abduct you.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.180
And I think it's all
part of the same thing.

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.550
It's all connected,

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.930
to Will,
the missing people,

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:12.100
to everything in Nome.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.900
If this type of thing
was happening to Nome,

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:20.240
to me, I think

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.120
it's happening
to other people.

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:30.370
Not just there,
but all over the world,

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.420
in towns, cities.

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.500
Most of them
don't even know it.

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.050
Know they're abducted?

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.550
How could they know?

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:45.850
How could they remember what
they're being forced to forget?

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.740
What the hell?

01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.560
Holy shit.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:32.990
Where are they?

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080
I don't know.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.710
I tried to tell you...
You don't know?

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:37.120
I want the video
played back.

01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:39.130
Sir, it didn't
record.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:40.290
It did, but nothing came out.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.210
Come on! Bullshit!

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.760
Ryan, pull yourself
together, man.

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.730
Calm down. Mom.
What the hell happened?

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:57.980
They took my baby.
They took her.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.310
Who?

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.810
They took my baby.
What is she talking about?

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.110
Someone kidnapped
Ashley.

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:03.900
Okay, I want this entire house searched.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.490
I want everybody
inside, outside

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:07.610
going through these
premises top to bottom.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.820
Ronnie, what'd you see?

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:10.660
Nothing. I came in
here and she was gone.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.450
What's going on here?
August, listen to me.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.580
I'm listening.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.330
A beam of light
came down,

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.790
and they took her
into the sky.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:21.210
They took my little girl
up into the sky. I saw it!

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:22.290
Through the
ceiling?

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.420
August, I saw it!

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.500
Through the ceiling?

01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:26.340
Yes. They took her
through the ceiling.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.550
What is this craziness?

01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:28.680
What the hell
is going on here?

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.840
I couldn't stop it.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.300
Okay. Everybody
clear this room!

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:32.390
I want everybody
out of here

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:34.760
except Ronnie
and Abbey!

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:36.560
Ronnie, sit down right
there, please. Okay?

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.430
Abbey, you sit down.
Please sit down. My baby.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.850
Okay? Sit here. I want
to talk to you, okay?

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.020
You just tell me.

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:43.770
Listen, less than five
hours after I arrest you,

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.570
your daughter
goes missing.

01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:46.650
I told you.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.690
Yeah, but
that's horseshit.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.990
We know that
that's not real.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.110
Tell me
what happened.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.450
You had an officer
outside my house.

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:52.530
Yes, we had
an officer outside.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.950
What did he see?
He didn't see anything.

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:55.910
He says that the videotape
wasn't playing. Now, just tell me.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.040
Where is she?
Listen, Abbey!

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.080
What did he see?

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.620
Get him in here right now!
You listen to me now.

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:01.080
You know what's real!
I want to know what he saw.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:02.880
You know what's real! You had
an officer outside my house!

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.040
God damn it!
Where is she?

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:05.710
You were supposed
to protect us!

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.630
Abbey, where is she, God damn
it? You tell me where she is!

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:12.800
Where is Ashley?
Where is she?

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:14.800
Mom!
Can't you stop?

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.140
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.720
Please, just stop!

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:21.690
Abbey, you haven't been
right in the head since Will.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.770
You just haven't been right in the head.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.400
You haven't
found his killer.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.650
What?

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.610
You still haven't
found his killer.

01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:30.900
No, Abbey, we have. Yes, we have.

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:33.110
He's still out there.
He's still out there.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.280
No. Listen, I'm removing
him from your custody.

01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:37.580
No.
Yes, I am,

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.910
and find a lawyer,
because you've run out

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
of all the goodwill
I've got, okay?

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.250
He's not
gonna take you away.

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.750
Guys, get in here. We're removing
Ronnie from Abbey's custody!

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.460
No. No, you're not! You will not...

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:48.380
Let go!
You will not.

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.010
No. No.
Let go!

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:51.590
No. No, no.
Baby, baby, no!

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.680
Let go. Let go.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.180
No, no. You're not taking my boy!

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.640
I'm sorry.
You're not taking my boy!

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.510
He'll be safe!
He'll be safe!

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.480
You're not
taking my boy!

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.040
God!

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:27.540
My babies!

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.720
Why are you doing this?

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.890
All I realized, that they weren't
going to be able to find her.

01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:44.270
That I would have
to do it on my own.

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.230
OSUNSANMl: But you couldn't leave.

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:51.780
No, that's not what I mean. I had to...

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:58.450
To find a way
to go directly to them,

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.740
directly to
the source.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.780
I know what I saw,
but I...

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.330
I can't accept it.
I can't.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.670
So please don't ask
me to, because I can't.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.720
I still have to
do this.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.300
But Scott, you...

01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:48.270
Is this the right way?

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:49.520
I don't know.

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:53.110
I don't have a choice.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:15:00.030
Yeah.
I know you don't.

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:09.540
Your eyes are
feeling heavier.

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.040
Seven, six,

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.380
five, four,

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:24.390
three, two

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.020
and one.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.480
Abbey?
Yes.

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:35.690
Let's go back three days, to Tuesday,

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:40.240
when you were giving
dictation in your bedroom.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.070
Yes.
Good.

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.080
Now, what happened after
you finished your dictation?

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:53.250
...remains unexplained,
and worse, unsolved,

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.090
like Will.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.920
Are you
sleeping?

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:01.050
Yes.

01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:05.090
What happened
next?

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:10.930
There's an owl.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.270
The owl.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.310
It's looking down at me.
It's looking down at me.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.980
Is it the same owl
your patients see?

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.110
Yes.
Yes.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.360
Except, it's smiling.
Except, it's smiling.

01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:28.580
I don't like it
when it smiles.

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.120
What do you mean,
smiling?

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.460
I don't know
what I mean.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.880
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.380
Well, it's too late to
forget what you already know.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.840
Tell me what you see.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.800
It's not an owl.
It's not an owl.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.630
God, help me! Help me!

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.930
No.

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:30.680
No! No!

01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:33.180
Help me! Help me!

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.110
Help me! Help!

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.730
Abbey,
what is it?

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.820
God, help me.

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:51.030
There are too many of
them. It burns. It hurts!

01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:01.130
No, no! Please!
Stop it. No.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.850
It's sticking
into my shoulder.

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:33.700
OSUNSANMl: So what
happened in that room?

01:20:34.450 --> 01:20:35.780
They came,

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.080
and we were...

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.580
We were...

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.040
They abducted us.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.840
All of us, but brought
us back that same night.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.310
We don't remember
where they took us

01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:03.230
or what
they did to us.

01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:08.980
Even with hypnosis,
it's black.

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:15.360
Your voice,
or its voice,

01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:18.070
said it was God.

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.740
What do
you believe?

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:23.250
I believe...

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:27.000
It's hard,
but I believe

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.170
the things I've seen,

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:33.670
the presence I've felt

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:36.010
inside of me

01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:41.470
is beyond anything
you can imagine.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.890
It was

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.600
hopelessness,

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.780
so it cannot be God,

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.240
but it can...

01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:58.450
It can pretend to be.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.620
And what about Ashley?

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.160
What about...

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.330
And what about
your daughter?

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.120
She...

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:12.500
I had to recover
from that night.

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:16.720
It took me a couple
of days to wake up.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.260
Abel...

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.680
It's...

01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:04.760
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:05.810
What is this?

01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.560
Look, I have
to apologize.

01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:09.390
I...

01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:14.110
I'm sorry, I really
hate to have to do this

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.900
when you're in this
condition that you're in.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280
It's okay.

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:24.370
So,

01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:27.700
well, I still have that
question for you, Abbey.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.460
How did Will die?

01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:43.680
He was murdered.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.720
No, Abbey.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:52.900
Abbey, he's going to show you
something that will upset you,

01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:57.320
but it has to be done.

01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:59.860
Understand?

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.540
This is the head
of a man

01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:15.380
who used this gun.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.010
Okay?

01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:29.850
Yeah. It was suicide,
Abbey. It was suicide.

01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:33.770
He took a pistol, shot
himself in the head.

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.850
There was no intruder.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.730
There was no knife. Just him with
his pistol at the side of your bed.

01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:45.530
He's not that man. He wouldn't
do that. He wouldn't do that.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.450
He wouldn't do that to us. He
wouldn't do that to his family.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.130
Tell him he's wrong. Tell him.

01:24:57.170 --> 01:25:02.420
I'm a psychologist, and I
would have known... Christ.

01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:06.550
I would have known
if he was gonna...

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:09.050
Abbey, Abbey.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.390
You can't blame yourself

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:13.310
for something that was
going on in his head.

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:19.480
Who knows what he'd learned,
what he didn't share,

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:22.900
and finally
what broke him?

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:25.030
Now you know
the reality.

01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:30.700
I'm gonna ask you for
the last time. Tell me.

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:36.330
What happened
to Ashley?

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:39.540
Tell me. Abbey.

01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:47.760
You know what happened.
You experienced it.

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.180
But we came back and she didn't. Abel.

01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:59.860
Tell him. Tell him what happened.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.490
Something took my daughter.

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:19.750
I don't know what. I
don't... I don't know how.

01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:27.590
I don't know what it was,
but you have to believe me.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.930
You have to
believe me, please.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.020
Please.

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:39.690
It's difficult
to go back.

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.190
Go back?

01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:48.700
Back over the line
from fiction to reality.

01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:56.700
You can't just stop being
insane whenever you want to.

01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:03.250
It's the kind of thing
that stays with you forever.

01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:09.550
OSUNSANMl: So Will
committed suicide?

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.390
Yes.

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:18.180
Your credibility. How do
you expect me or the audience

01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:19.770
to believe anything you're saying,

01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.770
if you actually
hallucinated

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.400
the murder
of your husband?

01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:26.820
They weren't
hallucinations.

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.360
I just couldn't...

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.700
It can be difficult
to face the truth,

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.660
and with Will,

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.370
that's how
I dealt with it.

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.290
And no matter
what you believe,

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:47.880
the recordings
do not lie.

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:54.090
we were talking about
things that aren't normal.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.390
...is dead.
...back is broken.

01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:04.810
And Ashley,
she's still gone.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:09.610
These are hard facts.

01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:11.780
They do
appear to be.

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:14.870
No, God damn it,
they are!

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:19.490
You can sit here
and speculate,

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.750
but I have to
keep hope alive.

01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:29.460
I have to believe
in what we're doing,

01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:32.590
my story,

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.390
that it will help.

01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:39.510
I have to believe

01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:44.690
that she's still
alive somewhere,

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.520
that she's safe.

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:52.820
I have to believe
that there's a chance

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.410
that I'm gonna
see her again,

01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:00.370
hold her again,

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:03.790
hear her voice.

01:29:07.090 --> 01:29:11.210
I just want
my little girl back.

01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:15.260
She's all I have.

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.470
Let's stop there.

01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:29.520
Dr. Tyler,

01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.190
we're done
for the night.

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:42.790
Someone else is interested
in Nome, as well.

01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:44.160
Since the 1960s,
there have been

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.210
over 2,000 visits
to Nome by the FBI,

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:48.290
the highest in Alaska.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.670
Second is Anchorage,

01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:53.010
with a population 76
times larger than Nome.

01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:55.840
The FBI have paid them
353 visits.

01:29:56.010 --> 01:30:02.350
In the end, what you
believe is yours to decide.

01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:00.470
UFO Reporting Center.

01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:02.220
Yeah, I got
a doozy for you.

01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:05.680
Okay.

01:32:05.850 --> 01:32:08.930
Gonna put me into the
hospital, I tell you that.

01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:10.980
what happened?

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.350
I'm a truck driver.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.690
I had a load to Salt
Lake City from Banning.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.440
I pulled over, didn't... I got out
of the truck, kind of stretched.

01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.490
I looked up
at the stars,

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:23.700
and I saw
these two...

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:26.830
There were quite a few of
them that were kind of low,

01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:29.330
and they were,
like, flickering.

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.450
You know, what could they be?

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.330
And then it occurred to
me, maybe I'm seeing a UFO.

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.790
Portland Air Traffic Control
Tower in Portland, Maine.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.000
Yes, sir.

01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:38.840
I guess
I have a UFO report.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:43.300
what they drew, and these four
people pretty much agree that,

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:47.050
actually, what they drew, it
looked like a fedora hat...

01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.430
I saw something spectacular
in the sky last night

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.430
that I have no
explanation for.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.440
In fact, I'm sure as many
as 50 to 100 people saw it

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.360
in different areas
last night.

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.110
I'm sure it had as many
as 20 pulsating red lights,

01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:04.110
one white light
in the front of it.

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.570
Like I said, it was
about 100 feet from me.

01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:10.790
To me, it looked about,
like, something...

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:16.000
Like I said, right... I remember
seeing it, but after that it just...

01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:19.670
I don't exactly
remember too much.

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:22.670
I could see this very bright red light,

01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:25.300
and it would change
to kind of a blue light,

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:27.260
and the reflection
off the clouds.

01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:28.390
Yes?

01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:31.180
And I could also hear this
very loud buzzing noise.

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:32.930
My daughter
is seven years old,

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:36.020
and she said it was in
the shape of a square.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.980
She said she's seen four
red lights in the corner

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:41.190
and a white one
in the middle.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.490
Okay. We had an aircraft
at 35,000 feet westbound.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.620
They reported
sighting four objects.

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.030
Three of them
were at his altitude

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:51.740
and one of them
was a lot lower.

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:54.700
We observed an unknown
phenomenon this morning,

01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:57.330
about 1600 Zulu,

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:00.460
and we observed it for
about 10 to 15 minutes.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.750
The targets were approximately 200 miles

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.130
west of San Francisco
over the water.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.550
They flew in what
appeared to be unison,

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.930
approximately
90 miles apart.

01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:13.220
Their speed was in
excess of 2,000 knots.

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.310
They did a high-speed
run for about 75 miles,

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.940
made a very
abrupt slowdown,

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.900
and then
a 180-degree turn,

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:23.440
and tracked back
northbound

01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:24.610
in excess
of 2,000 knots.

01:34:24.690 --> 01:34:26.740
It had
fire-engine red lights,

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:29.410
kelly green lights,
orange lights.

01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:32.990
It would shut all them lights
down and turn a bright white.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.120
It was zigzagging
in and out.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.580
It was shooting from one side
of the sky to the other side.

01:34:38.670 --> 01:34:40.170
It was almost as
if it was rolling.

01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:43.380
After eight to 12
seconds of this boiling,

01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:45.630
we saw an object come
up out of the water

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.880
and go straight
up into the air.

01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:52.220
It was a circular-shaped object.

01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:53.310
To give you
a brief on it,

01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:56.100
I was dispatched
on a UFO sighting.

01:34:56.310 --> 01:35:01.060
When I arrived, what I
saw was a real large craft

01:35:01.150 --> 01:35:03.060
in the air, circular.

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.070
I would say it was
at least 25 yards wide,

01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:08.240
or in diameter actually, it would be,

01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:11.910
and it was hovering over a
house, and it was motionless.

01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:14.160
They're real bright,
like a star,

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.290
and when it gets closer
to you, it gets dimmer.

01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:20.710
Then when it lands, it
goes into a big, big orange,

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.590
kind of like looking
at the sun or something.

01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:24.790
Uh-huh.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.260
And then when
the light goes out,

01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:29.380
it's like you turned
down a kerosene lamp.

01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:30.470
what exactly
happened was,

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:32.390
it was myself and a friend were flying.

01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:34.350
I'm a commercial pilot.
Yes.

01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:38.980
And we saw this object, and
it wasn't bright like a light.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.440
It was shining like
polished aluminum,

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.270
or polished metal.
Yes.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.190
Like a point source
that was emanating

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.070
several shafts
of black light.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.240
It was like
negative light.

01:35:54.330 --> 01:35:56.330
There's gotta be several
hundred people that saw it.

01:35:56.410 --> 01:35:59.160
We had an aircraft
that sighted a UFO.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.120
The pilot reported
an object passed

01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:07.380
approximately one eighth of a
mile in front of the aircraft.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:10.420
It was described
as being box-shaped.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.640
And as soon as I pulled over,
this object came straight at us,

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.180
straight to our vehicle. It
was huge. This thing was huge.

01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:20.730
It was black, huge. It had
these triangle lights on it.

01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:23.270
I have never been a believer
of UFOs in my entire life,

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:25.810
and I just seen a minimum
of nine this morning

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:27.360
with my own eyes,

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.900
and, I mean,
I am a believer.

01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:35.160
One orange, and at least nine of
the bright, bright moving lights.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.620
I was just staring at it, stopped

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.950
in my vehicle,
and it started to move,

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.670
and it had lights down each
side of it, like a triangle.

01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:45.670
Yes? And then, next thing I know,

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:48.550
I didn't take my eyes off
the damn thing. It was gone.

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:52.260
My little brother, he's three,
he'll be four next month,

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.220
last night he started
talking to my parents,

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.090
and I just got done
talking with him.

01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:58.260
He told my dad, "You
have to lock the door,

01:36:58.350 --> 01:37:00.270
"'cause the creatures
are gonna come get me,"

01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:02.520
and he said,
"The men in the stars,"

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.390
he said,
"they're coming to get me."

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.850
They follow him.
when he goes outside,

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:07.610
he says,
"The star follows me.

01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:08.770
"The star follows me."

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:10.440
You'd have to
experience this

01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:12.190
in order to
believe me.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.200
I'm afraid to walk outside. I need help.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:21.700
I don't know how to deal
with this. It's so strange.

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.710
I'm frightened
to go to sleep.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.000
what if they come back?
