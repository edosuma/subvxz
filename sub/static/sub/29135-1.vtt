00:15.116 --> 00:16.949
What the hell is going on?

00:16.951 --> 00:19.518
What the hell the
hell happened here?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.353
Where's Carly?

00:21.355 --> 00:24.990
My god, they're back.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.458
Mr. Palmer, wait!

00:26.460 --> 00:27.926
Mr. Palmer!

01:23.250 --> 01:26.185
I think we're wasting
our time, sheriff.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.620
He had too much of a headstart.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.890
He was driving a 50 year
old ice cream truck,

01:31.892 --> 01:32.958
for Christ's sake.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.060
How much of a headstart
could he have got?

01:35.062 --> 01:39.298
We've been driving in a
straight line for 30 minutes.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.633
I'd say maybe enough.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.336
Listen, this is the only
road in and out of town.

01:44.338 --> 01:48.040
He had to come this
way, he just had to.

01:49.910 --> 01:54.246
I think we must've
missed it, sheriff.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.316
You saw with he
done to them girls.

01:57.585 --> 02:01.520
If she's still alive,
there's a chance.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.388
We gotta take it.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.761
So we just keep
driving, that's it?

02:12.133 --> 02:14.032
Keep driving.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.834
Hey, you're the sheriff,

02:15.836 --> 02:19.471
but I'm just saying,
I think we lost him.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.942
Son of a bitch.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.836
Requesting back up
on Highway East.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.539
Suspect's vehicle is stationary.

02:53.541 --> 02:57.176
Possible medical
assistance required.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.395
Jody-Ann?

03:51.298 --> 03:53.031
All clear, sheriff.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.247
What the hell?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.996
Sweet Jesus!

04:27.101 --> 04:29.968
That sick son of a bitch.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.341
Don't move!

04:37.478 --> 04:39.444
Stay right there.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.127
You're Mary-Beth, aren't you?

04:59.266 --> 05:03.769
It's okay, sweetheart,
you're safe now.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.240
Come on, let's get you home.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.611
No, we can't go yet.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.080
Daddy, told me to stay here.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.717
It's okay, he's gone.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.519
It's just us.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.522
No.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.426
He's just waiting.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.742
Run.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.321
Run.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.892
Don't move.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.270
Oh God.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.567
No, sheriff!

06:44.271 --> 06:45.871
Sheriff!

06:45.873 --> 06:47.139
Sheriff!

07:12.199 --> 07:14.466
It's almost five years,

07:14.468 --> 07:17.235
five years since that night.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.237
Five years of nightmares.

07:19.239 --> 07:24.342
Five years since he took
Mary-Beth Palmer, the daughter.

07:24.545 --> 07:28.346
Five years since I started
to follow the carnage

07:28.982 --> 07:33.185
that lead me here.

07:51.004 --> 07:55.407
One thing, I know, he
loves places like this,

08:02.082 --> 08:05.016
quiet, unassuming towns.

08:08.455 --> 08:12.491
The kind of place where
these things don't happen.

08:18.232 --> 08:21.333
Missing women are
the dead giveaway.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.637
Most of them turn
up a few days later,

08:26.673 --> 08:28.507
one way or another.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.880
Usually, another.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.028
After five years,

08:52.699 --> 08:55.367
you start to feel like
it's only a matter of time

08:55.369 --> 08:57.536
before opportunity knocks.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.648
Morning, sheriff.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.417
You've been out here all day?

09:12.419 --> 09:14.953
Just having a coffee, sheriff.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.223
Wasn't a genuine
question, sheriff.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.926
People are complaining.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.495
They haven't tasted the coffee.

09:23.497 --> 09:24.529
Or maybe it's just not as good

09:24.531 --> 09:27.332
as Still Rivers' coffee, huh?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.903
Not even close.

09:33.173 --> 09:37.142
Maybe it'd be best if you
just head back there then.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.978
You know, for the coffee.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.316
Listen, Jody-Ann, I'm
trying to kind here,

09:44.318 --> 09:48.853
but you're making
people uncomfortable,

09:48.922 --> 09:55.160
talking about murder and
kidnapping and killer clowns.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.797
You're starting to
become a problem.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.500
I'm sure
you've got bigger problems

10:02.502 --> 10:04.569
than an out of state cop.

10:05.505 --> 10:09.240
Well, I'm trying to be kind
here 'cause of who you are,

10:09.242 --> 10:11.309
what you've been through,

10:11.445 --> 10:14.346
but you're an extra
problem I don't need.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.515
- If he's here--
- We'll take care of it.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.184
You're not needed here.

10:19.186 --> 10:23.221
More importantly,
you're not wanted.

10:25.559 --> 10:30.729
Jeez, what happened to
small town hospitality?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.398
It wore thin.

10:34.468 --> 10:38.336
Listen, you've been doing
this for what, five years now?

10:38.338 --> 10:42.774
Town to town, you're still no
closer to catching this guy.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.543
I think it's time you went home.

10:46.647 --> 10:51.249
Why don't you head back to
your motel, check yourself out?

10:51.752 --> 10:54.919
Must be people back
home will miss you,

10:54.921 --> 10:56.788
miss their sheriff.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.959
There's not much
left to Still Rivers.

11:01.695 --> 11:02.761
I don't think you understand

11:02.763 --> 11:05.597
what that night
did to that town.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.966
I'm sure I don't,

11:08.769 --> 11:12.270
but I'm still gonna have
to suggest you leave.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.240
That a suggestion, sheriff?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.676
An order.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.445
Look, sheriff or not, this
isn't your jurisdiction.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.914
You're still here tonight,
I'll get you checked in

11:22.916 --> 11:26.284
to one of our fancy rooms
down at the station.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.686
You read me?

11:30.157 --> 11:33.058
Loud and clear, sheriff.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.019
Not the first time.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.422
I get moved along more
often than I'd like.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.560
Being a cop on the
Still Rivers massacre

12:08.562 --> 12:10.261
comes with it's own baggage

12:10.263 --> 12:14.599
and makes that some
people uncomfortable.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.334
But maybe he's right.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.112
Maybe it's time to let go,

13:07.220 --> 13:09.954
time to clean the slate.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.760
Start fresh back home.

13:32.112 --> 13:37.649
Besides, it's been a long
time since I even had a lead.

13:48.028 --> 13:53.198
Maybe opportunities
finally stopped knocking.

14:53.927 --> 14:58.696
Hey, asshole, what the
hell is your problem?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.632
That's quite enough
for tonight, Darla.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.166
Why don't you get yourself home?

15:02.168 --> 15:05.069
Well, aren't you
gonna give me a ride?

15:05.071 --> 15:07.672
I'll make it worth your while.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.374
Good night, Darla.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.379
You couldn't afford me anyway.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.880
Asshole.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.594
Yeah, well, fuck you too, buddy!

16:08.735 --> 16:10.101
Goddammit.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.256
Oh my god.

16:32.926 --> 16:36.427
What's wrong with your face?

17:04.691 --> 17:08.826
Great, another shithole in
the middle of nowheresville.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.729
Don't talk about
yourself like that.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.997
Fuck off, Artie.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.632
Language, young lady.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.733
Young lady?

17:15.734 --> 17:18.403
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?

17:18.405 --> 17:19.203
Don't start.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.739
You try and show your
elders some respect, huh?

17:21.741 --> 17:26.810
We went to the same
school at the same time.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.216
You coming?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.452
I thought you meant
a proper restaurant,

17:34.454 --> 17:36.888
not some trucker's dirty armpit.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.523
Well, we tried to
book in at The Ritz,

17:38.525 --> 17:41.993
but out here they just
think that's a cracker.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.032
Move it, small fry.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.903
You coming?

18:14.360 --> 18:17.628
Right, well, I know
what I'm havin'.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.764
A heart attack if
you're not careful.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.731
Hey, I'm on vacation.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.066
I can let my hair
down if I want to.

18:22.068 --> 18:26.471
- Yeah, what's left of it.
- Leave your father alone.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.741
I think he looks distinguished,
like Bruce Willis.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.244
Jeez, knock it off, will you?

18:33.246 --> 18:33.911
We're in public.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.548
Yeah, we're about as far away
from public as we can get.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.917
What are you gonna have?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.119
I'm suddenly not hungry.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.821
Something must have
put me off my food.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.790
Well, I'm starving.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.326
Hey, where are you going?

18:48.328 --> 18:52.063
To the bathroom if
that's all right.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.632
I hope that's all
you're gonna do.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.035
Jesus, Dad, get off my case.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.806
Okay, what can I get y'all?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.575
Is the
chili vegetarian?

19:04.577 --> 19:09.413
Honey, the only thing
vegetarian around here

19:09.415 --> 19:11.449
are the cows.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.417
If you don't like meat,

19:13.419 --> 19:15.520
you can always
have the meatloaf.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.588
It's mostly bread crumbs.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.599
No, no, no!

20:01.601 --> 20:02.900
Fuck!

20:06.206 --> 20:07.505
Fuck!

20:59.726 --> 21:00.992
Ocupado.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.998
There's someone in here!

22:07.927 --> 22:11.595
So we start up here
in San Francisco

22:11.597 --> 22:15.499
and we went down
through Arizona,

22:16.202 --> 22:19.970
Mexico, Texas,

22:19.972 --> 22:21.272
right through Oklahoma.

22:21.274 --> 22:23.040
I've been trying to take
back roads, you know,

22:23.042 --> 22:25.343
trying to get some
culture into these kids

22:25.345 --> 22:26.677
before we hit DC.

22:26.679 --> 22:31.148
My, ain't that quite
a trip y'all takin'?

22:31.417 --> 22:35.853
Let me tell you, see
this road right here?

22:35.855 --> 22:39.490
Takes you straight to
Tennessee through some

22:39.492 --> 22:44.962
of the purtiest landscapes
you have ever seen.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.264
Ah, see, hey, hey, this is why

22:47.266 --> 22:48.499
it pays and talk to the locals.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.735
They know all secrets
this place has to offer.

22:50.737 --> 22:54.305
Oh, we got lots of
secret around here.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.541
I was trying to find you.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.442
Where have you been?

22:58.444 --> 23:00.177
We're ready to go.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.046
I was in the bathroom.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.447
Doing what?

23:03.816 --> 23:05.049
What do you think?

23:05.051 --> 23:08.352
Knowing you, you were
popping those pills again.

23:08.354 --> 23:11.255
Who do you think you are?

23:12.125 --> 23:13.724
Who do you think you are?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.993
Your dad set this trip
up to get away from that

23:15.995 --> 23:17.595
and those people you
hang around with.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.930
The least you could
do is try to act

23:19.932 --> 23:22.133
like a respectful daughter.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.635
You're not my mother, Tiffany.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.405
You're right.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.439
If you were mine,

23:28.441 --> 23:31.642
you wouldn't have turned
out the way you are.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.611
You think just because you
were a bitch in high school,

23:33.613 --> 23:36.747
I won't put you down
right here, right now?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.849
Hey, girls, girls.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.085
Come on, open road awaits.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.887
Coming, dear.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.802
Y'all have a safe journey, now.

24:20.393 --> 24:21.959
Is that it?

24:22.161 --> 24:24.428
Ain't much this week, huh?

24:25.364 --> 24:26.997
Well, luckily,

24:26.999 --> 24:33.070
I have just sent some
fresh meat your way.

25:01.801 --> 25:05.836
There's a feeling again in
the pit of your stomach.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.506
When you get a lead,

25:08.508 --> 25:09.306
that lead that you know

25:09.308 --> 25:12.209
will take you to what
you're looking for.

25:16.582 --> 25:20.684
This feels like
one of those leads,

25:22.488 --> 25:24.388
like I'm getting close,

25:28.561 --> 25:31.795
closer than I've
been in a long time.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.738
Closer to the man
that I'm looking for.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.356
Don't move!

27:39.492 --> 27:41.558
Sheriff's department, I'm armed.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.495
Stay right where you are.

27:48.401 --> 27:49.700
Hello?

27:50.670 --> 27:52.603
Can you hear me?

28:03.549 --> 28:04.815
Hatcher?

28:11.023 --> 28:12.322
Jeez!

28:20.466 --> 28:21.732
Freeze!

28:29.275 --> 28:31.141
I said hold it!

28:40.319 --> 28:42.920
Police, I said freeze!

28:45.124 --> 28:48.459
Wait, who the fuck are you?

28:48.461 --> 28:50.694
I was trying to help ya!

28:51.197 --> 28:53.964
The note, that was you?

28:59.271 --> 29:00.571
Sheriff?

29:00.573 --> 29:03.240
Howells, you copy? Over.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.077
Kale, I found something.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.213
It's him.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.781
He was here.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.249
That's the thing.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.017
We have a local here.

29:14.019 --> 29:17.121
She saw him last night.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.358
Did you copy that, Jody-Ann?

29:22.328 --> 29:23.694
Copy that.

29:24.597 --> 29:27.531
Looks like we're
taking a road trip.

29:39.912 --> 29:43.313
Please stop, I'm
trying to take your picture.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.415
Come on.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.285
Hey, come on.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.622
Smile.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.190
What the fuck are you doing?

29:53.192 --> 29:56.193
Taking your picture
for the holiday album.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.096
Jesus, Artie,
can't you keep your

29:59.098 --> 30:01.131
whatever she is in check?

30:01.133 --> 30:04.501
Man, you're such a killjoy.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.102
Why?

30:05.104 --> 30:07.671
Because I don't like people
flashing lights in my face?

30:07.673 --> 30:10.541
She's just trying
to enjoy herself.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.776
You should try it sometime.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.144
Very little chance
of that happening

30:14.146 --> 30:17.114
on this fucking Chevy
Chase road trip.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.148
I know what you mean.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.616
When Artie said sunny holiday,

30:19.618 --> 30:23.687
I was picturing more
beach tan and cocktails.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.923
We're in the same boat, sister.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.724
You didn't have to come, Chase.

30:27.726 --> 30:29.126
You chose to be here.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.563
Fuck, Tan, why you always
gotta be like this?

30:32.565 --> 30:36.433
Everyone's just trying to
enjoy a little vacation.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.201
Vacation?

30:37.203 --> 30:40.237
This is like being hauled
around in a prison truck.

30:40.239 --> 30:44.341
Y'know, sometimes you
can be so ungrateful.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.475
We'd much rather be
spending our summer

30:45.477 --> 30:49.346
doing something better than
this but we're out here for--

30:49.348 --> 30:50.214
For what?

30:50.216 --> 30:51.782
For my sake?

30:51.784 --> 30:53.050
Go fuck yourself, Arthur.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.352
I didn't ask for this and
I sure as hell didn't ask

30:55.354 --> 30:57.955
to be a model for my
brother's new piece

30:57.957 --> 30:59.156
and her amateur photography.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.059
Come on, Tanya, you
need to chill out.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.862
We're young, dumb
and.

31:05.664 --> 31:09.032
Just try and lighten up.

31:09.802 --> 31:13.237
See, you look nice.

31:13.672 --> 31:14.771
I swear to god!

31:14.773 --> 31:15.873
Hey, what's going on back there?

31:15.875 --> 31:17.507
They're trying to piss me off.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.210
Artie and his whatever she is.

31:20.212 --> 31:20.777
Hey!

31:20.779 --> 31:22.846
Artie, stop aggravating
your sister.

31:22.848 --> 31:23.881
Are you kidding me?

31:23.883 --> 31:26.116
She's the one who
needs to get a grip.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.117
If you guys don't stop,

31:27.119 --> 31:29.686
I'll stop, we're gonna get
out, we're gonna look--

31:29.688 --> 31:31.622
Larry!

31:38.964 --> 31:40.998
Kids, are you all right?

31:41.967 --> 31:43.233
We're okay.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.369
We're all right, Mr. Harvey.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.803
Tanya?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.275
Why the hell did
you stop like that?

31:52.945 --> 31:57.347
Oh my god, I am so sorry,
I didn't see you there.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.749
Are you okay?

31:58.984 --> 32:01.852
My god, what are you doing
in the middle of the road?

32:01.854 --> 32:03.654
Are you okay, honey?

32:04.556 --> 32:07.491
Um, I'm lost.

32:07.493 --> 32:10.460
Where did you come
from, sweetie?

32:10.462 --> 32:12.429
I lost my way home.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.631
And where's home?

32:14.633 --> 32:15.699
Where'd she come from, Dad?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.801
There's nothing
around here for miles.

32:17.803 --> 32:21.004
I've been out here
an awful long time.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.743
- Are you serious?
- What?

32:26.745 --> 32:27.644
It's for my holiday album?

32:27.646 --> 32:31.081
Okay, we're just gonna
go wait in the van.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.816
What do you think
is wrong with her?

32:32.818 --> 32:34.785
I don't know, sounds local.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.154
Probably lost a screw or two.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.424
What do we do with her?

32:40.426 --> 32:41.258
I don't know.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.928
I guess we could just take
her to the next drop off point

32:44.930 --> 32:47.064
and call the cops or the
paramedics or something.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.366
No way, the diner,
there was a sign.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.968
Last stop for 500 miles.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.104
We could take her
back to the diner,

32:54.106 --> 32:55.939
maybe leave her there?

32:57.409 --> 32:59.910
You could always take me home.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.612
Where's home, sweetie?

33:02.614 --> 33:04.114
The Sunny Farm.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.350
It's not far up there.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.652
That's where my daddy lives.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.927
And you're sure
it's on this road?

33:17.296 --> 33:19.496
Okay, well that's what we'll do.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.630
We'll drop you there.

33:20.632 --> 33:21.531
Come on, little lady,

33:21.533 --> 33:23.934
you can ride up front with me.

33:24.937 --> 33:26.670
Hey, come on.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.277
Found her this morning,

34:08.280 --> 34:10.679
staggering around the roads.

34:10.815 --> 34:15.284
She's been running all
night, feet like stumps.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.924
Shouldn't she be getting
medical attention?

34:20.926 --> 34:23.260
We're waitin' on forensics.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.233
She said she saw him?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.002
So she says.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.838
She's got quite a story.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.462
Darla?

35:01.900 --> 35:03.300
Do you mind?

35:06.905 --> 35:08.538
Go right ahead.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.942
I already told your
boss everything I saw.

35:14.046 --> 35:17.447
If you wouldn't mind
going over it again.

35:18.217 --> 35:21.218
You ain't from
around here, are you?

35:22.855 --> 35:24.054
What gave it away?

35:24.056 --> 35:27.491
You don't look like
one of these inbreds.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.461
Local whore, was it?

35:32.531 --> 35:34.531
That's what they call me.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.333
Real nice, huh?

35:39.738 --> 35:41.104
Real nice.

35:43.609 --> 35:44.908
Yeah.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.045
Can you tell me what you saw?

35:49.047 --> 35:53.283
That man from the news.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.286
The clown.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.290
You sure it was him?

36:00.526 --> 36:04.060
Look, I may be a whore,
but I ain't a liar.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.096
And I know what I saw.

36:06.832 --> 36:11.368
It was him, the Cleaver.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.438
So what happened?

36:18.777 --> 36:21.745
He asked me to
pass on a message.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.183
What message?

36:54.146 --> 36:56.947
Are you ready to chat?

36:57.583 --> 37:00.183
What were you doing
at the factory?

37:00.185 --> 37:01.952
Does it matter?

37:01.954 --> 37:03.486
I'd say so.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.722
You were just found
at a crime scene

37:05.724 --> 37:08.692
along with the body
of a missing girl.

37:08.694 --> 37:09.693
These guys are gonna charge you

37:09.695 --> 37:12.762
with at least
obstruction of justice,

37:12.764 --> 37:15.465
if not an accomplice.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.067
And you?

37:17.069 --> 37:19.135
I tried to help you.

37:19.504 --> 37:20.770
Doesn't matter what I think.

37:20.772 --> 37:24.908
I hold about as much weight
here as a feather duster.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.414
Why did you send me the note?

37:34.753 --> 37:37.320
'Cause I thought you could help.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.923
Who exactly are you?

37:43.195 --> 37:46.563
I was adopted real young.

37:48.333 --> 37:53.670
A few years back, I
found out I had a sister.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.073
I don't expect you to
know what it's like

37:57.075 --> 37:58.875
to have no idea
where you come from

37:58.877 --> 38:05.148
but for me, it was
like a lifeline

38:05.250 --> 38:09.719
to all the answers I've
yearned for my entire life.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.357
Managed to track her down.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.362
It was real easy,
as it turns out.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.532
Do you know why?

38:25.103 --> 38:27.270
'Cause she's murdered.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.675
Do you know by whom?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.215
She was the same as
me, didn't have nobody.

38:39.217 --> 38:44.688
No one to look out for her,
to protect her, to avenge her.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.327
I know what that's like.

38:51.763 --> 38:58.034
And it's all I could
do to try and stop him.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.605
I heard about you,

39:04.009 --> 39:07.544
that you were there that night,

39:11.883 --> 39:14.250
looking for him out here.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.122
That's why I came to you.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.460
And I,

39:27.165 --> 39:29.366
I thought you'd understand.

39:33.505 --> 39:38.641
I do, that's why I need you
to tell me what you know,

39:38.643 --> 39:40.377
how to find him.

39:40.379 --> 39:41.077
Why?

39:41.079 --> 39:45.181
So you can lock him up
and he can sit here alive?

39:45.183 --> 39:48.585
While all them that he
killed lie six feet under.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.920
Otherwise, there'll be more.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.297
I can find him.

40:02.601 --> 40:03.700
I don't know if you've noticed,

40:03.702 --> 40:08.304
but you're not really in a
position to be finding nobody.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.206
That's the deal.

40:10.275 --> 40:14.077
You get me outta here,
and I can find him.

40:14.212 --> 40:18.348
That's what I've been doing
this whole time, keepin' up,

40:18.350 --> 40:20.550
waiting for my chance.

40:21.319 --> 40:23.753
A chance to finish this.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.992
And how do we go about
all that exactly?

40:30.562 --> 40:34.330
First, you gotta
get me outta here.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.301
Are you sure this is the place?

41:11.303 --> 41:12.802
Yes, sir.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.439
And this is where you live?

41:16.441 --> 41:18.842
Yeah, just me and my pa.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.681
- What the hell?
- What is it?

41:24.683 --> 41:27.217
Well, the gas, we're on empty.

41:27.219 --> 41:28.685
I thought I told you to fill up.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.054
I did, I'm sure I did.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.423
Well, obviously, you didn't.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.492
Dammit, Larry, how are we
gonna get up to the border

41:35.494 --> 41:37.026
without any gas?

41:37.028 --> 41:37.961
His truck ain't here.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.629
He must be out
but I'm sure my pa

41:39.631 --> 41:42.131
will have some gas for y'all.

41:42.267 --> 41:46.135
Yeah, we can wait for him.

41:50.375 --> 41:53.076
Come on in, he won't
be long, I'm sure.

41:53.078 --> 41:55.545
He'll show you where the gas is.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.348
I'm sure he'd love
to meet y'all.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.356
What do we do?

42:06.358 --> 42:10.193
- I guess we'll have to wait.
- You wanna go in there?

42:10.195 --> 42:11.561
Yeah, no offense, Pops,

42:11.563 --> 42:13.730
but who knows what
we'll catch in there?

42:13.732 --> 42:18.034
No offense, Mr. Harvey,
but it looks gross.

42:18.470 --> 42:19.536
Come on, don't be so soft.

42:19.538 --> 42:22.305
Without gas, we're not
gonna make it to Tennessee

42:22.307 --> 42:24.908
unless you all wanna walk.

42:25.877 --> 42:26.809
Y'all comin'?

42:26.811 --> 42:30.113
Come on, I lived
through worse in 'Nam.

42:30.115 --> 42:31.915
Your dad served in 'Nam?

42:31.917 --> 42:34.884
No, he just went
there on vacation.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.620
Listen to your father.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.659
Hey, little girl,
you got chai tea?

42:45.096 --> 42:46.563
Tan, you coming?

42:46.831 --> 42:49.098
I'm gonna wait in the RV.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.501
You're missin' out.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.703
I'm sure I'll survive.

43:02.314 --> 43:06.482
The
smiling face of terror.

43:08.119 --> 43:10.320
A practical joker.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.696
With a deadly taste for revenge.

43:24.369 --> 43:25.802
What the?

43:28.506 --> 43:31.641
Jody-Ann, what the
hell are you doing?

43:32.177 --> 43:33.543
I'm takin' her.

43:33.545 --> 43:35.745
She knows where to find him.

43:36.147 --> 43:37.280
Are you crazy?

43:37.282 --> 43:40.450
For all we know, she
killed that woman.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.654
Don't event think
about it, sheriff.

43:44.723 --> 43:49.092
Now come on, let's
just talk about this.

43:49.094 --> 43:51.794
You and I both know
this is a lot easier

43:51.796 --> 43:54.197
than me trying to convince you.

43:56.167 --> 44:01.004
Keys, just in case you
got any bright ideas

44:01.006 --> 44:02.805
about following us.

44:07.412 --> 44:09.045
To her, please.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.084
This ain't ever gonna end well.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.786
You know that.

44:18.456 --> 44:22.492
Maybe, but it'll be an end.

44:23.194 --> 44:25.128
That's all that matters.

44:48.253 --> 44:52.789
Goddammit, Jody-Ann, what
the hell are you doing?

44:58.697 --> 45:00.229
Y'all make yourself at home.

45:00.231 --> 45:03.099
I'm gonna change
out of these rags.

45:07.072 --> 45:08.705
Thank you.

45:12.711 --> 45:17.080
Well, it tastes as
good as it looks.

45:23.488 --> 45:30.126
Oh god, who would let a child
live in a place like this?

45:30.195 --> 45:32.261
I don't know, maybe it's just
how people live down here.

45:32.263 --> 45:33.930
Still, it doesn't
make it healthy

45:33.932 --> 45:35.598
for an innocent
young girl, does it?

45:35.600 --> 45:39.068
Ew, who keeps
this kind of stuff?

45:39.070 --> 45:41.571
Uh, it's not that weird, right?

45:41.573 --> 45:45.842
I mean, maybe he's
like a science teacher.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.745
Hey, where's your sister?

45:48.747 --> 45:49.579
She's in the van.

45:49.581 --> 45:52.548
Dammit, Artie, you know she
needs watching at all times.

45:52.550 --> 45:55.451
She's probably out there
popping pills already.

45:55.453 --> 45:56.452
She's fine.

45:56.454 --> 45:59.422
She just wasn't feeling
this place is all.

45:59.424 --> 46:00.123
Do blame her?

46:00.125 --> 46:03.726
Do you remember that the
reason that we're on this trip

46:03.728 --> 46:06.195
is to keep an eye
on your sister?

46:06.197 --> 46:08.765
Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.333
You think that's making
her life any easier,

46:10.335 --> 46:12.101
treating her like
some sort of prisoner?

46:12.103 --> 46:16.005
Well, to be quite honest,
she's brought it on herself.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.807
She's only proving that
she can't be trusted.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.542
Whoa, where are you going?

46:19.544 --> 46:22.278
- To get your sister.
- No, you're not.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.846
You're just gonna
make things worse.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.014
- I'll go.
- Make things worse?

46:25.016 --> 46:29.886
Yeah, last thing we need is
you pretending to be our mom.

46:30.789 --> 46:32.755
Hey!

46:33.591 --> 46:34.957
Let him go.

46:38.229 --> 46:40.530
This doesn't taste like chai.

46:40.532 --> 46:43.032
You think they have any sugar?

46:43.034 --> 46:44.033
Jesus Christ.

46:44.035 --> 46:45.434
Your own sister.

46:45.436 --> 46:48.771
Tell you I've heard of
hefty troubles in my time,

46:48.773 --> 46:51.340
but your own sister?

46:51.342 --> 46:53.276
It's ridiculous.

46:53.378 --> 46:56.112
That said, it's all the
same around these parts.

46:56.114 --> 47:01.284
Wife, girlfriend, sister,
just interchangeable terms

47:01.286 --> 47:03.452
on the lips of a redneck.

47:03.655 --> 47:08.224
For you boys just joining
us, you're listening to.

47:09.227 --> 47:10.960
For you boys just joining us,

47:10.962 --> 47:13.196
you're listening
to Hank Bushball,

47:13.198 --> 47:16.833
keeping your ears
alive on the long haul.

47:17.769 --> 47:19.502
Is fine all day.

47:19.637 --> 47:21.904
Stop your grinnin',
drop your linen,

47:21.906 --> 47:27.310
and listen up as we talk about
all manners deep and dark.

47:28.012 --> 47:32.882
Back on our favorite subject
for the Halloween season.

47:44.295 --> 47:47.363
I think someone's
cooking something.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.533
We're talking
about the advance

47:50.535 --> 47:54.704
of Still Rivers five
years ago today.

47:54.772 --> 47:57.840
Oh, I mean since they
treat this guy lately

47:57.842 --> 48:00.676
like global warming,

48:00.778 --> 48:04.480
responsible for everything
in a thousand mile radius.

48:06.084 --> 48:09.886
The fact remains
he's still out there.

48:10.021 --> 48:13.623
I was never a man who
believed in the devil.

48:13.625 --> 48:18.227
Let me tell you, the things
I've read about that man,

48:18.229 --> 48:21.998
make your bones
freeze with terror.

48:23.201 --> 48:24.233
The kids out there now,

48:24.235 --> 48:27.837
who's gonna keep them
safe if he strikes again?

48:27.839 --> 48:30.873
After all, don't let
this state fool ya.

48:30.875 --> 48:32.441
It's Halloween and that's

48:32.443 --> 48:35.811
when he comes knockin'.

49:01.306 --> 49:03.306
Oh, my god, you're.

49:03.308 --> 49:05.675
Lil' Miss Cleaver.

49:43.314 --> 49:43.980
The tea!

49:43.982 --> 49:47.316
There's something in the tea!

49:48.853 --> 49:50.152
Artie?

49:55.460 --> 49:56.759
Artie?

50:06.437 --> 50:07.336
Hello, miss?

50:07.338 --> 50:11.874
Have you heard the
good word?

50:38.069 --> 50:40.636
Did I do good, Daddy?

50:40.638 --> 50:43.406
You did perfect, little lamb.

50:43.408 --> 50:45.441
Just one more to go.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.022
How's the coffee?

51:00.591 --> 51:02.458
Haven't tried it yet.

51:05.496 --> 51:06.862
Lucky you.

51:07.131 --> 51:08.964
It's not the best.

51:09.367 --> 51:11.600
Can we take these off now?

51:12.537 --> 51:15.471
Come on, I'm not an idiot.

51:15.673 --> 51:19.008
You don't need your hands
to tell me what you know.

51:22.180 --> 51:25.448
I thought we were
tracking this bastard.

51:25.450 --> 51:27.716
You're not, I am.

51:27.985 --> 51:30.586
That's not how this is gonna go.

51:37.929 --> 51:40.396
This is how this is gonna go.

51:40.998 --> 51:42.998
You're gonna tell
me what you know.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.767
We're gonna track
this bastard down

51:44.769 --> 51:46.735
- and then--
- And then what?

51:46.737 --> 51:49.872
- I'll bring him in.
- Are you fucking crazy?

51:49.874 --> 51:52.308
We need to stop him for good.

51:52.310 --> 51:54.710
Like for good good.

51:55.847 --> 51:58.614
You said you could find him.

51:58.816 --> 51:59.915
Now, am I wasting my time here

51:59.917 --> 52:03.452
or am I dragging your
ass back to Pine Meadows?

52:04.222 --> 52:07.690
We find him, we bring him in.

52:08.926 --> 52:11.827
And what happens
to me after that?

52:13.364 --> 52:17.466
You go to jail, serve
your time for obstruction,

52:17.468 --> 52:20.736
- if you're lucky.
- What about you?

52:21.172 --> 52:26.876
I get five, most
likely, if I'm lucky.

52:28.179 --> 52:30.012
This is bullshit.

52:31.082 --> 52:32.381
Maybe.

52:32.984 --> 52:35.618
But it's bullshit on my terms.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.823
So, we got a deal or
we're turning back now?

52:43.294 --> 52:44.560
Fine.

52:46.330 --> 52:49.965
To find this guy, you need
to know exactly how he works.

52:49.967 --> 52:53.102
Every serial killer
has their own pattern.

52:53.104 --> 52:56.105
Thorn, that panda
guy, all of them,

52:56.107 --> 52:58.007
they all have a pattern.

52:59.010 --> 53:00.676
Once I figured out Layton's,

53:00.678 --> 53:03.012
keeping up with him was easy.

53:03.981 --> 53:06.882
Then how come no
one's caught him yet?

53:06.884 --> 53:09.685
Out here, no one's lookin'.

53:10.121 --> 53:11.520
Except you.

53:11.956 --> 53:13.889
I've always been
right behind him.

53:13.891 --> 53:17.359
He appears every October 29th,

53:17.962 --> 53:20.396
30th, 31st.

53:20.932 --> 53:22.298
Halloween.

53:23.034 --> 53:24.767
Such a cliche.

53:24.969 --> 53:27.203
It's hard to know
where it'll stop.

53:27.205 --> 53:29.605
I tracked the missing
girls just like you did

53:29.607 --> 53:30.739
and here he was.

53:30.741 --> 53:32.641
So you found him but
you didn't stop him.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.210
That's why I left you the note.

53:34.212 --> 53:38.314
I figured you'd be more
equipped with dealing with him.

53:39.817 --> 53:41.750
He's already moved on.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.852
Not far.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.154
There's only so many places

53:45.156 --> 53:47.856
between here and
the county line.

53:48.893 --> 53:52.328
What's to stop him
jumping the county line?

53:52.863 --> 53:55.164
He never does, ever.

53:56.901 --> 53:58.667
Not till he's done.

54:02.006 --> 54:04.206
Then we better get movin'.

54:18.256 --> 54:22.825
Y'all have a nice
day now, sheriff.

54:44.248 --> 54:48.017
I must have left them somewhere.

54:53.658 --> 54:54.290
Oh!

54:54.292 --> 54:56.692
Oh my god, thank you.

55:22.953 --> 55:24.753
Hello, Dad?

55:26.424 --> 55:27.723
Artie?

55:40.304 --> 55:41.537
Tiffany?

56:05.129 --> 56:07.529
Why are we stopping?

56:10.134 --> 56:12.201
It's trash on the road.

56:14.105 --> 56:15.738
Where do you think you're going?

56:15.740 --> 56:17.272
To take a look.

56:19.043 --> 56:22.544
Don't worry, it's not
like I can get very far.

56:28.652 --> 56:29.785
One of the first
things you learn

56:29.787 --> 56:31.987
when you're tracking someone

56:31.989 --> 56:34.590
is that anything
could be a clue.

56:35.192 --> 56:37.626
This is
nothing but an empty road.

56:37.628 --> 56:39.561
Yeah, in the middle of nowhere.

56:39.563 --> 56:43.098
So why is there a buildup
of oil right here?

56:43.634 --> 56:46.301
Maybe someone stopped
to change the tire

56:46.303 --> 56:47.336
and a million other reasons.

56:47.338 --> 56:49.371
In the
middle of the road?

56:49.373 --> 56:50.773
I doubt it.

56:50.908 --> 56:54.576
The only reason you'd stop
is if something stopped you.

56:54.879 --> 56:56.445
Something?

56:57.248 --> 56:59.081
Or someone.

57:05.322 --> 57:06.722
What is it?

57:07.258 --> 57:08.957
Looks like.

57:09.660 --> 57:10.926
Is that?

57:11.495 --> 57:14.830
- Mary-Beth Palmer?
- Looks like it.

57:15.800 --> 57:19.134
This could be days or weeks.

57:20.070 --> 57:20.869
Doubtful.

57:20.871 --> 57:25.441
In this Arkansas night air,
it'd be long gone by now.

57:26.076 --> 57:27.643
You sure?

57:27.645 --> 57:29.178
Pretty positive.

57:29.513 --> 57:31.046
- Plus.
- What?

57:31.048 --> 57:36.118
It's dated today,
about two hours ago.

57:36.654 --> 57:41.557
Whoever took this photo is
in a buttload of trouble.

57:48.699 --> 57:50.866
If they passed here,
there's very little

57:50.868 --> 57:53.135
between here and the border.

57:53.537 --> 57:54.903
How little?

57:54.905 --> 57:56.371
About one thing.

57:56.774 --> 57:59.274
A cluster of old farmhouses,

57:59.410 --> 58:02.344
50 miles off the highway and
in the middle of nowhere.

58:02.346 --> 58:04.913
Just the kind of place he'd use.

58:05.115 --> 58:08.617
We better get movin', who
knows how long we have?

58:42.052 --> 58:43.819
Hey, sunshine.

58:43.821 --> 58:45.754
Roosters are crowing.

58:46.457 --> 58:48.924
Time to rise and shine.

58:52.396 --> 58:55.230
Wakey, wakey, eggs
and bakey.

58:58.802 --> 59:00.569
What?

59:00.571 --> 59:01.870
What?

59:04.441 --> 59:05.140
Tiffany!

59:05.142 --> 59:08.176
What have you done to her?

59:09.580 --> 59:10.846
Dad?

59:11.916 --> 59:13.215
Tanya!

59:18.522 --> 59:20.322
Oh my god.

59:21.458 --> 59:22.691
You!

59:23.260 --> 59:24.560
You led us here.

59:24.562 --> 59:28.530
Oh, we have a clever one, Daddy.

59:30.367 --> 59:31.800
Where's Arthur, where's my son?

59:31.802 --> 59:33.702
What have you done to him?

59:33.704 --> 59:36.471
Oh, he wasn't in a great mood.

59:36.473 --> 59:41.410
In fact, he's still screaming
upstairs.

59:41.412 --> 59:44.212
You bastard, how could you?

59:44.214 --> 59:45.514
Larry?

59:47.585 --> 59:49.251
What's happening?

59:50.921 --> 59:52.187
Oh, god.

59:52.323 --> 59:57.392
I'm so glad you caught up on
your beauty sleep, darling.

59:58.295 --> 01:00:00.729
Now, we can get started.

01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:03.031
Please, don't!

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:10.572
If you would, little lamb.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:20.215
Okay now, let's get this
party started.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:29.791
What do you want, you maniac?

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:35.998
Oh, dad, I'm sure you
know how hard it is

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.734
to raise a kid all on your own.

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:40.902
What?

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.605
Which one's it gonna be?

01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:46.742
What, what do you mean?

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:49.845
Only fair to let you choose.

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:51.380
Choose?

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:53.181
Choose what?

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.058
Which one will be the brine

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.128
and which one will
be the brisket?

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:10.198
You just leave them alone!

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:17.539
We got ourselves a prize pig.

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:21.209
- She's gonna make a great mom.
- Get away from her!

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:24.012
Why are you doing this?

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.449
Well now, papa,

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:34.122
my dearest here hasn't had
a mama in a long, long time.

01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:42.431
That just isn't right
for a little girl, is it?

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:45.100
To be without her mama.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:52.474
Although, her real mama was a
dirty whore so she had to die!

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:59.214
So, come on now,
you choose, daddy O.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:02.384
Larry.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.987
I can't choose.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:07.389
You can't expect me--

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:11.126
I can and I will
or you will die!

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:14.396
I'll start with
this one over here!

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:15.997
- Wait!
- Help!

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:18.433
Please come help me.

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:22.804
Kill me, just please
leave her alone.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:32.481
You have to choose me,
she's your daughter.

01:02:32.483 --> 01:02:37.119
So, what does that make you?

01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:38.887
I'm his wife.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:47.062
Oh, Papa Larry,

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:50.599
you are a dark horse.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:54.002
I must be thinking you
have lovely daughters

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:55.837
and one's already a mama.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.240
I'm her stepmom!

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.278
I really like this one.

01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:08.984
Now, who's it gonna be?

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:12.587
The lovely daughter
or the yummy mummy?

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.105
I choose my wife.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:33.275
No!

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:34.109
No!

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:36.578
- No!
- Larry, no, you can't!

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.979
I'm sorry, Tanya.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.981
- No!
- But your life until now

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:44.586
as an addict, you're
better off this way.

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:47.322
Oh, that's real dark,

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:52.060
and I'm a fucking killer
clown, for Christ's sakes!

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:57.232
But I get it.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:02.003
You upset the wife,

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.507
gonna get it right in the neck!

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.934
Now, we just gotta figure out

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:36.938
which one of these little
piggies we get to keep

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.075
and which one
becomes roast beef.

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:48.917
Please, I'll stay.

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.286
Just let her go.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:57.092
Sounds like we've got
company, little lamb.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:02.063
Why don't you go make
them feel right at home?

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.698
Yes, Daddy.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:03.391
You sure this is
the right place?

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:06.328
You could bet your ass on it.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.767
Jesus Christ.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:17.772
We got a plan?

01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:20.141
Go in, take a look around.

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:25.080
All right, okay then, I
was tired of livin' anyway.

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.401
Someone's been here,

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:48.970
recently.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.741
Looks like they still are.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.314
Sheriff's department!

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:00.949
Someone there?

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.853
Oh, it's a trap!

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:06.087
I probably should
have mentioned.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:08.890
- What?
- Traps are kinda his thing.

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:14.796
Yeah, probably worth mentioning

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:16.898
before we walked into
a serial killers lair?

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.700
Well I didn't want
to get in over your--

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.606
You okay?

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:32.347
I'm fine, just go get him.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.761
Hello?

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.063
Help!

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.834
Help, is
somebody there, hello?

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:54.736
We're down here!

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.337
Hello?

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.173
Please help us!

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:42.149
Wait, who the fuck are you?

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:45.487
Well, I guess I'm the cavalry.

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:49.290
Well, you want to
get us out of here?

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.140
Mary-Beth?

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.212
Mary-Beth Palmer.

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:48.816
Somebody here
wants to say hello.

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:20.782
Sheriff?

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:24.085
Oh my god, sheriff, I've
been lookin' for you.

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:45.039
Come on, we gotta go.

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.641
There's a padlock.

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:47.775
Well, can you get it off?

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:50.845
I'm trying, it'll
take me minute.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.914
Go and start the van.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.415
What about you?

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.651
We'll be right behind you.

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:58.386
Right?

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.389
Sure.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.525
Go!

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.809
Where you going, darling?

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:25.246
This party's just
getting started.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.426
What's
wrong with you?

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:41.029
He was our first.

01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:45.233
First what?

01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:46.801
What's wrong with him?

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.936
He's one of our family.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:51.239
He was Daddy's first test.

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:54.342
Turned out well,
didn't you, Hatcher?

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.113
What did you do to him?

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:03.785
We turned him mad as
a Hatcher.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:11.292
My god, you're just like him.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.761
What can I say?

01:12:16.299 --> 01:12:18.766
It runs in the family.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:34.215
Mary-Beth, you don't get it.

01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:37.151
Your father, he's a monster.

01:12:37.153 --> 01:12:40.588
Like father, like daughter.

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:47.362
What are you doing?

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:50.198
Don't hurt deputy.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:52.900
Hey, little miss.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:58.005
I think it's your nap time.

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:11.119
Sheriff, we have
to get out of here.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:29.937
Sheriff.

01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:34.108
Sheriff, wait.

01:13:36.146 --> 01:13:38.012
What are you doing?

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.247
I can't.

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:46.687
I can't live

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:50.792
- like this.
- Sheriff, sheriff, no!

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:09.010
- Shit, he's gone.
- Tanya, did she get away?

01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:11.345
Not unless she
learned how to fly.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:13.281
We have to go get her.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.451
Jody-Ann, Jesus, what happened?

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:18.953
I found, I found Hatcher.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.289
- Where is he?
- Dead.

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:22.657
Is anyone else with you?

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:25.359
That's Tanya.

01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:26.794
I'll get her.

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.164
Get on the radio, call Kale.

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:33.935
Tell him where we are,
tell him we need backup.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:36.003
Kale, but he'll haul us both in.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:37.405
Just do it!

01:14:54.224 --> 01:14:56.157
Hello, Sheriff Kale?

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:59.293
Who is this?

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:00.761
Misty Lewis.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.163
Do you know how
much shit you're in?

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:05.099
When I find you, you're
going straight to jail.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:08.603
Listen, Howells,
she needs backup.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:10.037
We found him.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.973
He's got a family.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:16.110
Sheriff, people are
seriously dead up here.

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:19.714
I'm sendin' backup.

01:15:19.716 --> 01:15:21.415
What's your position?

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:29.757
I need you to wait here.

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:30.491
Wait, what?

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:31.592
Where are you going?

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:32.994
I got something to take care of.

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:34.228
The cops are on their way.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.264
What do I tell them?

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:38.266
Tell them where we went.

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:08.796
Here piggy, piggy.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:25.479
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:34.555
Little pig, little
pig, let me come in

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:40.528
or I'll huff and
I'll puff and I'll,

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:47.134
and I'll blow your house in.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:11.826
Smart piggy.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.098
Fuck you, clown.

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:30.277
Oh, dear darling,
time to pipe down.

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:56.871
We better get that leg off
before it gets infected.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:00.374
Ruins the taste of the meat.

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:07.148
How about the vegetarian option?

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:11.118
You okay?

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:13.020
I'm stuck.

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.281
I can't move it.

01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:42.717
Keep the gun on him.

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:57.231
You okay?

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:01.936
No, I'm--

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:05.106
Don't you know
guns are dangerous?

01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:08.309
I prefer something
more effective.

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:10.911
Gets the blood flowing.

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:16.083
Goodbye, deputy.

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:25.559
Hello, fucker.

01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:02.963
You wouldn't shoot a
defenseless little clown,

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:03.898
now would you?

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.700
Do you remember my sister?

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:07.434
Misty, stop.

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:10.304
Backup's here, it's over.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:11.605
Do ya?

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:13.407
Do you remember her?

01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:16.243
Misty, please, don't do this.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:20.381
Oh.

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:22.583
Yes.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.220
Do you know who I am?

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:31.525
If you do this,
you can't go back.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:35.229
I hope you carve up as nice
as she did, little pig.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.099
It's over.

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:40.467
He's done.

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.382
Fuck you, clown.

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:29.750
You're goin' away
for a long time.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.487
That makes the both of us, then.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:46.267
Not if you're gone
when they get here.

01:21:46.269 --> 01:21:48.602
What's gonna happen to him?

01:21:48.804 --> 01:21:53.741
They'll put him somewhere
to rot, like old meat.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:00.481
I prefer the fresh stuff.

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:27.808
Little pig, you're
tougher than I thought.

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:32.179
It runs in the family.

01:22:59.909 --> 01:23:03.043
Jody-Ann Howells, you
hold it right there.

01:23:03.045 --> 01:23:05.112
I'm not going anywhere.

01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:07.681
Neither is he.

01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:11.285
Goddamn.

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:13.454
That's him?

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:16.724
That's Carlton
Layton, the Cleaver?

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:19.760
That's the one.

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:24.498
Jesus, Jody-Ann, this is a mess.

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:28.769
Things in that
house, the bloodbath.

01:23:29.038 --> 01:23:30.904
Look, if any of
us keep our jobs--

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:33.607
This one
needs an ambulance.

01:23:33.609 --> 01:23:35.342
Where is Tiffany?

01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:39.713
The house, you got
the other one, right?

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:41.648
And the hostage.

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:44.985
What?

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:48.555
The house, his
daughter was there

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:51.725
and a woman, the hostage.

01:23:51.994 --> 01:23:53.794
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:56.797
We swept that house,
there's no one in there.

01:23:56.799 --> 01:23:58.699
No one alive, anyway.

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:06.807
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:14.988
Open wide.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.503
It's been a while, but I
think y'all finally ready.

01:28:35.678 --> 01:28:37.878
Let's have a look at y'all.

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:48.088
So, you ready to play?

01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:54.361
Mama.

01:29:20.389 --> 01:29:23.623
¶ Hey, honey, he ain't
clowning around ¶

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:27.394
¶ The Cleaver's coming
so you gotta go out ¶

01:29:27.396 --> 01:29:30.630
¶ He's gonna chase ya,
gonna make you a mess ¶

01:29:30.632 --> 01:29:36.470
¶ You gonna die 'cause
killing is a family business ¶

01:29:36.472 --> 01:29:42.376
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:44.578
