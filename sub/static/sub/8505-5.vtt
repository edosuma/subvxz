00:08.092 --> 00:09.885
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.969 --> 00:11.595
- What's your name, darling?
- Agent.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.180
- They've taken all the evidence.
- Not all of it.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.182
Tissue sample
from Jane Scott's autopsy.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.560
Something is calling me,
pulling me away.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.894
- To where?
- I don't know.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.938
<i>The only thing that brought me
out west was a promotion, Jack.</i>

00:21.022 --> 00:22.398
<i>You sure
it wasn't a broken heart?</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:23.733
I'm very happy for you, Daniel.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.484
- I love you, Daniel.
- I love you, too.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.529
Just because we don't carry guns
doesn't mean we're not in the SSR.

00:28.612 --> 00:32.491
<i>The council has determined
to shut down the Isodyne programme.</i>

00:32.616 --> 00:34.910
<i>The woman's body
is being taken care of.</i>

00:34.994 --> 00:37.204
You think the men I work for
are just criminals.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.873
They're in everything!

00:38.998 --> 00:41.208
Have I been dying to talk to you.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.461
- What did you say?
- She wanted names.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.588
<i>Mr Hunt made a mistake.</i>

00:45.755 --> 00:47.381
And mistakes can be fixed.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.010
<i>- Whitney...</i>
- What are you?

00:51.093 --> 00:52.470
Whatever I want.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.116
Peggy.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.204
Peggy.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.624
Peggy!

01:21.707 --> 01:24.543
Don't do that.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.128
I could've shot...

01:26.504 --> 01:27.797
Howard.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.964
Can you come to the lab?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.803
That's the tissue sample
from Jane Scott's autopsy.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.763
- What's wrong with it?
- Mmm-hmm. Nothing.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.932
Just watch.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.229
Any moment now.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.235
How are you doing that?

01:49.318 --> 01:50.778
I don't know.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.240
It's drawn to you.

01:55.533 --> 01:56.826
I'm drawn to it.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.744
It's calling me.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.246
It wants me to...

02:00.329 --> 02:01.413
Wait!

02:01.497 --> 02:03.916
Jason! Jason!

02:04.625 --> 02:05.876
Oh, my God.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.179
I know where Jane Scott's body is.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.724
And I'm calling for...

02:20.808 --> 02:23.978
I can't explain it,
but Jane Scott's body is there.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.855
How can you know for certain?

02:25.938 --> 02:27.606
This is more than knowing it.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.775
It's... I can feel it.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.318
That'll be all.

02:32.444 --> 02:35.990
Rose says that address
is the County Cold Storage building.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.491
It also happens to be owned

02:37.575 --> 02:39.869
by Calvin Chadwick's chum,
Thomas Gloucester.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.246
Just that small amount of Zero Matter
made me tangible.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.497
Temporarily.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.875
With access to Jane Scott's body
and what's in it,

02:45.958 --> 02:48.085
it's possible
I could completely cure myself.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.421
Mr Jarvis, does Howard have a hearse?

02:51.422 --> 02:53.674
No. But he does have a woodie.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.510
- Mmm! Good enough.
- For what?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.345
We're going to steal Jane Scott's body.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.222
Oh... Oh!

03:36.300 --> 03:37.384
Oh, no.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.312
Who's that?

03:48.395 --> 03:51.565
Oh, hey. You scared me.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.776
Scared you? You broke into my house.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.945
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.365
I thought
it would be nice to surprise you.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.576
I must've nodded off.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.411
Honey, I'm so sorry.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.331
I didn't know you had a thing planned.
I had to cover an extra shift.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.417
Let me get some coffee going.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.129
Regina called in sick.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.881
Actually, do you remember Regina?

04:15.965 --> 04:17.758
Uh... The one with the lisp?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.843
No, no. The one with the mole.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.720
Anyway, her youngest
has a stomach bug.

04:21.804 --> 04:24.181
Vomit everywhere, or so she says.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.060
Rumour is her husband surprised her
with one of those televisions.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.979
So she could've been...

04:30.062 --> 04:31.438
Lying.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.984
I, um... I lost something.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.236
Oh...

04:37.319 --> 04:39.571
Let me help you.
What are you, what are you looking for?

04:39.863 --> 04:41.865
You'll know it when you see it.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.786
- You're not making any sense.
- I know. Um...

04:46.495 --> 04:47.871
I mean...

04:48.789 --> 04:50.291
This is going terribly.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.127
You're wonderful.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.962
You're pretty wonderful yourself.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.171
Thank you.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.299
When I first moved here,
I just wanted a fresh start,

04:58.632 --> 05:02.303
and then I met you,
and you were so mean.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.430
I was not mean.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.599
Yes, you were cruel
and uncompromising and lovely.

05:07.683 --> 05:09.643
Yeah. All those months
of physical therapy with you,

05:09.727 --> 05:11.520
and I started to feel like myself again.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.730
Because of you.

05:12.855 --> 05:13.939
Daniel.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.153
I had a whole speech prepared,

05:19.236 --> 05:21.113
and none of my plans involved
asking you to marry me

05:21.196 --> 05:23.073
with my hands in the couch
because I lost the ring.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.745
I can't find the ring.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.373
Oh, that's why.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.583
That's why.

05:33.876 --> 05:34.960
Then let's find it.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.213
So yes?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.548
Oh, yes!

05:39.631 --> 05:40.716
Yes.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.263
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.390
- All right.
- Oh!

05:48.474 --> 05:50.851
- You found it?
- No. It's a quarter.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.478
Keep looking, though.
We could make some money here.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.427
Geez!

06:26.053 --> 06:27.930
Good. You're awake.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.141
I need your help.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.605
This really isn't necessary, Mr Jarvis.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.399
We could've just brought
the woodie closer.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.442
And scratch the paint
with those heels?

06:40.651 --> 06:42.319
I'm perfectly happy to give you a boost.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.446
We have to be in and out
before they open for business.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.282
Uh!

06:55.207 --> 06:56.583
Aren't you coming?

06:56.667 --> 06:58.043
Me? In the vent?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.337
Isn't that why
you wore your recreation tie?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.432
It's freezing in here.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.893
Oh, this is bringing back
terrible memories.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.645
To the last time that you stole a corpse?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.939
No. Apricot preserves.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.942
My granny's house. In the cellar.

07:22.151 --> 07:25.279
Cold, cramped,
and teeming with spiders.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.489
That's it.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.535
If you had to guess at the probability

07:31.618 --> 07:33.579
of spiders nesting in an air vent...

07:33.662 --> 07:35.622
I'm quite certain we're safe, Mr Jarvis.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.793
Cal, keep up with me.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.628
Do you hear something?

07:41.712 --> 07:42.963
- Okay, just take it easy.
- Follow me.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.383
Whitney, this is not right.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.471
She's here.

08:01.899 --> 08:02.941
Open it.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.444
- I still don't understand what...
- It called me here.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.654
It wants to be let out.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.490
Open it.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.548
Should you really be touching her?

08:26.632 --> 08:27.883
Yes. I have to.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.323
I need an atomic bomb.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.039
She wants Zero Matter.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.291
She's trying to replicate
the original atomic test.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.751
How do you mean?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.170
She's a scientist
and every scientist knows

09:05.254 --> 09:07.839
that in order to achieve
the same results in an experiment,

09:07.923 --> 09:09.591
every variable must be identical.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.886
That means setting off an atomic bomb
in the same location

09:12.970 --> 09:16.181
and opening that rift or whatever it was.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.018
I can't emphasise this enough,

09:20.102 --> 09:21.770
we cannot let her do this.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.647
Then we'll just have to stop her.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.607
Which means stopping an atom bomb.

09:25.691 --> 09:26.984
Not just any bomb,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.111
the bombs used in the Isodyne test.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.029
Those were manufactured by Roxxon.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.197
After 1946,

09:32.281 --> 09:33.824
the two remaining warheads
were put in storage.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.451
Well, it won't be the first time
we've infiltrated a Roxxon facility.

09:36.535 --> 09:39.580
They have several facilities,
and the location of each is classified.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.666
There's no way to know
which one is housing the bombs.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.211
Well, that's not entirely accurate.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.881
Mr Stark's rivalry
with Hugh Jones is ever ongoing.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.052
He's had extensive research done
on Roxxon and all its facilities.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.388
Call it corporate espionage.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.016
There is one particular Roxxon location,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.601
a few hours outside of Los Angeles,

10:00.684 --> 10:02.519
which I believe
would be the most likely place.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.021
Why is it our leading contender?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.230
The security.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.441
Compared to the other facilities,
it's quite intense.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.568
I believe
the word "impenetrable" was used.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.070
In my experience,
nothing is impenetrable.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.572
That may well be,

10:13.655 --> 10:15.449
but Mr Stark has never been able
to get anyone

10:15.532 --> 10:17.117
inside this particular location.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.495
The elevator requires a special key,

10:20.621 --> 10:22.080
one that's impossible to duplicate.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.957
We don't need a key.
We'll blow the hinges off the door.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.627
Which would trigger the explosives
set inside them and kill us all.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.837
- We'll drill into the lock.
- Which would pierce the acid core,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.422
spraying into the elevator,
and kill us all.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.673
- We'll dig a hole.
- Which would trip

10:31.798 --> 10:33.925
the 3,000-volt mechanism underground

10:34.009 --> 10:36.178
- and kill us all.
- And kill us all.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.765
So, a key, you say?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.976
We cannot steal atomic bombs.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.687
It's not stealing
if your company made them, dear.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.272
Well, tell that to Hugh Jones.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.690
If the Council found out, I...

10:48.774 --> 10:51.193
If we obtain more Zero Matter, Cal,

10:51.276 --> 10:53.278
then the Council answers to us.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.780
This is insane.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.741
People thought Galileo was insane.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.787
This plan will work, Cal.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.288
It will work.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.956
Look at me.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.294
You have seen what I can do
with just a small amount of Zero Matter.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.588
I mean, can you imagine,

11:11.672 --> 11:13.423
just imagine what we could accomplish

11:13.507 --> 11:17.052
if we had the power
to bend the world to our will.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.305
No more war, no more fear,

11:20.389 --> 11:25.143
and you, you would finally get
the recognition

11:25.227 --> 11:27.437
and the respect that you deserve.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.613
How do you, uh,
see us accomplishing this, hmm?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.954
I think it's time
we lean on my connections.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.505
I wake up.
I'm searching my pockets. It's gone.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.341
The ring is completely gone.
I can't find it.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.843
What's all this, then?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.302
Didn't you hear?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.096
Chief finally asked his girl to marry him.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.181
Poor Violet.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.558
Doesn't realise she could do better, huh.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.061
Congratulations, Daniel.
Violet's a lucky woman.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.896
Thank you. It means a lot.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.691
Can I speak to you? A moment?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.109
Yeah.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.947
Thompson called
poking around for you again.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.824
How many vacation days you got left?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.868
Plenty. I haven't had a day off
since Pearl Harbour.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.412
How is your
disguise department shaping up?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.623
For you? Low on evening gowns. Why?

12:28.999 --> 12:31.543
I need to sneak into Hugh Jones' office.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.879
At Roxxon?
You sure that's a good idea?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.547
Didn't you meet him
last year in New York?

12:35.630 --> 12:36.882
I'm sure
he doesn't pay that much attention

12:37.007 --> 12:38.049
to every woman he meets.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.968
Oh... He'd remember you, Peg.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.305
The guys at the lab
have something new.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.766
If it works, you wouldn't have to rely
on just a disguise.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.434
Thanks. We'll need this.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.894
What for?

12:48.977 --> 12:50.270
Greasing the wheel.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.524
What's the catch?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.485
No catch, Dr Samberly, just pie.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.236
We thought you'd enjoy a slice.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.698
And maybe Agent Carter could borrow
that thing you're working on.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.867
I knew there were strings attached.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.744
We call it the Memory Inhibitor.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.371
You place it like so.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.415
No.

13:10.499 --> 13:11.708
Well, you put it to the subject's temples.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.585
It disrupts the pathway
of the prefrontal lobe...

13:13.668 --> 13:15.045
It makes them forget
the last two minutes.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.254
Amazing. And it works?

13:16.338 --> 13:19.049
We've run several tests on Jerry
with positive results.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.134
No, you didn't.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.640
- It's all right, Jerry.
- There is a slight risk of brain damage.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.896
Oh, I can't wait for lunch.
I'll be right down.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.337
What's your name, darling?

13:58.713 --> 14:01.341
Hi, Mr Hugh... I mean, Mr Jones.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.802
- I'm Wanda.
- Huh.

14:03.885 --> 14:04.928
Have we met?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.304
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.722
Are you sure?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.892
Because I never forget a face.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.895
I think I would remember
meeting a handsome...

14:13.979 --> 14:16.940
Well, I mean,
important man like you, Mr Jones.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.650
I just started here.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.360
Accounting sent me to grab a file.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.903
Accounting, eh?

14:21.987 --> 14:24.573
Those fellas are dull as dishwater.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.533
But they certainly
have an eye for talent.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.078
I'll tell you what. I have to go to lunch.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.372
When I come back, I'll send for you,

14:32.455 --> 14:34.457
and we can crunch some numbers.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.126
I look forward to it.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.460
Oh!

14:39.671 --> 14:41.214
You arrogant plonker.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.147
Agent.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.275
I remember you!

15:00.859 --> 15:02.652
I'm calling security right now.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.573
And if SSR wants to search my office,
you'll need a warrant.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.377
What's your name, darling?

15:19.586 --> 15:22.130
Mr Jones, you're running late
for your lunch. You better hurry.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.299
Sure thing. But stay close.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.885
I think your work
will need some special attention

15:26.968 --> 15:28.136
when I get back.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.944
Agent!

15:52.827 --> 15:54.162
Oh!

15:58.083 --> 15:59.250
Oh, crumbs.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.669
He's wearing it.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.093
Oh, what's your name, darling?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.102
I heard a rumour
about redheaded women...

16:26.361 --> 16:28.238
Did the boys from Sales send you?

16:32.367 --> 16:34.119
You're saving the world.
You are saving the world.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.537
You are saving the world.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.690
Did you have a nice lunch?

17:06.776 --> 17:08.278
I must have.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.871
Mr Manfredi,
there's someone to see you.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.804
Hello, Joseph.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.598
- Joe, it's a pleasure to see you.
- You got a lot of nerve

17:36.681 --> 17:37.724
coming in here with him.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.353
You know what I do to men
who steal from me?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.819
I'm kidding, of course.
Come on. It's been a decade, right?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.613
- Yes.
- Right. I'm happy you're happy.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.031
Come on. Sit down.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.324
I'll be a gentleman. I'll stand up.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.992
Sit, sit. Sit.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.457
Get that out of your way.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.293
- You get my wedding gift?
- I did.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.003
Wedgwood sauce boat, real nice.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.089
- Mmm! Thank you. It was lovely.
- You liked it?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.966
Yeah, well,
nothing says classy like bone china.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.802
- I always say that.
- Mmm-mmm.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.470
Hmm...

18:17.472 --> 18:20.225
So, what are we doing today?

18:20.975 --> 18:23.228
Well, as you know,

18:23.311 --> 18:26.022
my husband, Cal, is running for Senate.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.066
- And if he wins...
- Yeah, I know the crowd he runs with.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.609
He's getting elected.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.030
I'm sure you've heard
of the proposed freeway system.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.156
Mmm-hmm.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.617
Those construction contracts
are gonna be worth millions,

18:38.201 --> 18:39.661
and they would all be yours.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.246
And what would you need in return?

18:41.329 --> 18:42.622
Just some men.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.792
Some men to help me
move some equipment.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.836
Now we're talking.
How many guns do you need?

18:47.919 --> 18:49.838
No guns. No guns.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.050
Just some of your men

18:54.134 --> 18:57.428
who are good with their hands
and discreet.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.433
Sounds like a pretty sweet deal for me.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.353
But I'm gonna require
a little bit more than money.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.231
You have friends at the paper, right?

19:08.481 --> 19:11.568
I need assurances that my name
and the name of my associates

19:11.651 --> 19:13.403
will no longer grace his front page.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.114
- I don't know that I can...
- Excuse me one moment. Shh!

19:16.573 --> 19:18.074
You, come over here.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.785
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.251
She's a beautiful lady, isn't she?
A real knockout, right?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.545
- Yeah, boss.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.214
Kind of girl you want to take
around town and show her a good time?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.592
She's pretty, yeah.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.802
Hey! Hey!

19:38.344 --> 19:39.929
You don't think I can see?

19:40.013 --> 19:43.057
She's my guest, and you're
undressing her with your eyes?

19:43.433 --> 19:45.101
That is not

19:45.351 --> 19:48.271
how you treat a lady!

20:07.040 --> 20:09.876
I'm sorry about that.
He was being very inappropriate.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.712
So,

20:14.631 --> 20:16.007
do we have a deal?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.676
Deal.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.639
This field serves as a runway
for private planes.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.682
There's a minimum of four guards,
all heavily armed,

20:24.766 --> 20:26.392
stationed within this perimeter.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.019
And this fence is electrified, I assume?

20:28.102 --> 20:31.397
Indeed. Once we're inside the building,
we'll need to find the freight elevator

20:31.481 --> 20:32.982
and use the key
to access the lower levels,

20:33.066 --> 20:35.443
where Roxxon stores
its highly classified items.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.153
So, you're saying
once we get past the guards

20:37.237 --> 20:38.446
and the electrified fence,

20:38.529 --> 20:40.406
all we have to worry about
is diffusing the atomic bombs?

20:40.490 --> 20:42.283
Actually, I don't think
you'll need to worry on that front.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.369
Chief Sousa
has the steadiest hands I've seen.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.287
Well, since mine, of course.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.414
Former reconnaissance scout.

20:48.498 --> 20:52.001
Let's just say this won't be my first time
diffusing a bomb.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.419
These aren't just bombs.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.589
One mishandled uranium rod
could trigger an explosion

20:56.673 --> 20:58.591
that would decimate the entire city.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.343
Sounds like a bomb to me.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.013
You just destroyed all of Los Angeles.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.558
And this is all the intelligence
that we have?

21:07.642 --> 21:08.851
Nothing from the inside?

21:08.935 --> 21:11.854
I'm afraid Mr Stark's men
have never been able to gain access.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.148
- We'll be going in blind.
- And unarmed,

21:14.232 --> 21:16.109
given the volatile nature
of the materials inside.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.486
And severely outmanned.
I don't like this.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.697
Are we sure the SSR isn't an option?

21:20.989 --> 21:22.407
The Council has their hands
in everything.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.284
There's no one we could trust 100%.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.621
Actually, that isn't entirely true.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.796
- Rose?
- She's someone we can trust.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.550
Peggy, this is crazy.
We can't take Rose.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.094
- She's... She's...
- She's passed the same training

21:43.177 --> 21:44.971
as the men upstairs,
and she protects all of you.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.306
This isn't about training.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.266
It's about field experience,
and she has none.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.810
I can't focus on the mission
if I'm worried about protecting Rose.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.770
It's funny, I'm seeing Daniel Sousa,

21:52.854 --> 21:54.480
but I'm hearing Jack Thompson.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.359
She's smart, she's resourceful,
and I trust her with my life.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.986
I'm just worried she's gonna get hurt.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.780
Hey!

22:07.535 --> 22:08.953
Oh! Hi.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.461
I can't believe the Chief is letting me
come on a mission.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.129
Well, he knows talent when he sees it.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.840
Well, how about this?
An enhanced motion detector.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.009
Gives you accurate readings
from up to 50 feet away.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.345
If anybody tries to sneak up on you,
this will tell us.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.471
Do you know how it works?

22:26.804 --> 22:28.723
Well, I think I could figure it out.

22:29.307 --> 22:30.892
What are you doing in here?

22:32.060 --> 22:35.104
I brought you back
your Memory Inhibitor.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.564
Thank you so much for letting me use it.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.274
How'd it work?

22:38.399 --> 22:39.692
I forget.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.028
I don't like people in my lab.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.863
I don't like people touching my stuff.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.783
This isn't a candy store, you know?

22:46.866 --> 22:47.909
Just 'cause you brought me pie,

22:47.992 --> 22:50.745
doesn't make you entitled
to rifle through my work.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.665
Did you like my pie?

22:55.083 --> 22:56.376
That pie was you?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.419
Your pie was in me?

22:58.920 --> 23:00.505
I like pie.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.298
Pie is good.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.801
Dr Samberly, we have
a very important mission ahead of us.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.636
We need all the help we can get.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.097
What he's trying to say, Aloysius,

23:10.014 --> 23:11.766
is we need your equipment.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.061
Very well.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.232
You got any instruction manuals
for these things?

23:19.315 --> 23:21.567
No. These are mostly just prototypes.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.027
Haven't been put through trials yet.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.278
Can you show us how they work?

23:24.404 --> 23:25.822
Sure. Got six hours?

23:25.905 --> 23:27.573
I was thinking more of a crash course.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.451
This is ridiculous.
I'm going with you.

23:30.535 --> 23:31.953
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- So sweet, but...

23:32.036 --> 23:33.371
No. Terrible idea.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.040
After the war, I had 11 job offers.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.208
Eleven.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.044
I went with the SSR
because I was told I had an opportunity

23:40.128 --> 23:41.921
to use my expertise in field operations.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.215
- Who told you that?
- You did, Chief Sousa.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.134
Don't you remember?

23:48.136 --> 23:50.054
That hurts me. Right here.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.181
Listen, I interviewed a lot of prospects.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.891
But you picked me.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.685
And I picked you because I thought

23:55.768 --> 23:58.146
I'd be doing
more than tinkering around this lab

23:58.229 --> 24:00.273
while other agents went off on missions.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.066
Fine. You're on the team.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.484
What else you got?

24:04.444 --> 24:08.114
Let me go pack up my bag of toys.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.076
How can you be sure he's
not in the Council's pocket, as well?

24:12.160 --> 24:13.744
I'm sure.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.913
Everybody hates Samberly.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.825
- Where did you park?
- Oh!

24:52.909 --> 24:54.535
Sorry. I had to park around the corner.
Street cleaning.

24:54.619 --> 24:55.703
Back in a jiffy.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.680
- This is a bad plan.
- It's a horrible plan.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.224
It's a solid plan.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.020
Hey! You need to get back in your truck
and leave.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.814
I'm so sorry to bother you,

25:23.898 --> 25:26.359
but my husband and I are lost.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.736
Husband?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.781
Yes. That's us.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.157
Married.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.243
Very much in love. With each other.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.328
You need to leave. Now.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.163
- They're going to die.
- We're going to die.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.540
They're going to be fine.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.708
If you could just point us
back to the main road...

25:42.792 --> 25:44.752
This is a restricted area.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.170
Leave.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.589
Whatever happened to "please"?

25:48.673 --> 25:50.800
There's no reason to be rude to my wife.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.010
My wife.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.179
I will never get tired of saying that.

25:55.263 --> 25:58.307
Honey, uh, maybe we should go already.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.893
Uh... Fine.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.609
What's that?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.585
It worked.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.254
Well, I never doubted it for a moment.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.217
Interesting choice of shoes.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.261
Venetian leather. Top notch.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.597
Rolex. Not something you could afford

26:37.680 --> 26:39.015
on a security guard's salary.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.516
Or a scientist's.

26:40.683 --> 26:41.976
<i>We've got the side door open.</i>

26:42.059 --> 26:43.603
<i>Come meet us when you're ready.</i>

26:43.686 --> 26:45.229
Be right there. Let's keep moving.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.530
Keep your eyes and ears open.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.240
There's no telling
what we'll find down here.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.583
Unfortunately, it seems
Miss Frost may have already arrived.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.501
Let's stick to the plan.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.179
Look at this place.
This is gonna take forever.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.306
Maybe not. Over here.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.938
Quite the setup.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.231
Help me with this.

27:35.821 --> 27:36.989
What are those lights for?

27:37.073 --> 27:38.324
Security system.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.159
Looks like
it controls the locks on the doors.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.619
- Dr Samberly...
- I know.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.454
I think I can...

27:43.579 --> 27:45.039
There, doors are unlocked.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.125
But that means
they're open for Whitney Frost, too.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.670
There. Look at that.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.797
Are they double thick walls?

27:52.963 --> 27:55.132
It looks like a room
with extra special security.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.759
That's where we're going, then.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.219
Where are my bombs?

27:58.302 --> 27:59.679
Whitney, I don't work here.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.472
- But you're sure they're here?
- Yes.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.642
Spread out. Search every room.

28:07.687 --> 28:08.979
This way.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.024
Hold on. We've got movement.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.527
I'm picking up
a signal in the next hallway over.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.112
Whitney's men.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.364
I got this. You guys keep going.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.824
No, Rose...

28:32.670 --> 28:34.088
Howdy, cowboy.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.760
Ah! I've seen bigger.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.527
We've got them.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.530
Picking up someone
headed towards us, around the bend.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.450
- Do you think you can lock it?
- Maybe.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.078
Okay.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.998
Take this one step at a time.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.625
Blue and yellow...

29:11.709 --> 29:12.835
Any day now, Doctor.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.087
Almost... There!

29:18.424 --> 29:19.467
Oh...

29:19.675 --> 29:21.719
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

29:21.802 --> 29:24.013
- Dr Samberly, fix it.
- I'm trying.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.224
Uh... There must be
a wire crossed somewhere.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.602
System's remarkably complex.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.562
There's no time.
Talk Mr Jarvis through the procedure.

29:31.645 --> 29:32.897
I'll take care of our company.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.774
What?

29:34.857 --> 29:36.317
Where is she? Where's she going?

29:37.485 --> 29:38.652
What did she say?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.739
Is the door opening soon?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.494
Jarvis, listen to me.
Take a deep breath.

29:49.663 --> 29:50.998
You calm?

29:51.665 --> 29:55.002
Now, you're gonna have to
remove the bomb from the crate.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.255
- Remove the bomb from the crate.
- Yes.

29:58.339 --> 29:59.715
Mmm.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.509
Remove the bomb from the crate.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.237
Good job, Jarvis.
Just one more screw left.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.032
It's okay. Screws can't hurt you.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.617
The dangerous stuff is inside.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.538
I did actually know that.

30:33.374 --> 30:34.750
Okay.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.881
Oh, God. I feel sick.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.091
Stay focused.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.303
Just put on the gloves,

30:46.887 --> 30:48.180
grab the tongs,

30:48.264 --> 30:50.599
just like taking a soufflé
out of the oven.

30:52.893 --> 30:53.978
Probably.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.563
Oh! No way that's good.

30:55.688 --> 30:56.856
How's it going, Dr Samberly?

30:56.939 --> 30:58.023
Not well.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.442
I finally get a chance
to get out in the field, and look at me.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.320
My father was right.
I will never amount...

31:03.404 --> 31:06.907
Dr Samberly,
you have got to calm down.

31:07.700 --> 31:08.868
Rose?

31:08.951 --> 31:11.620
You are the smartest person
in this building.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.163
You got this.

31:13.831 --> 31:16.166
Yes, I... Yes.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.003
Give me a second.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.882
Here. Ugh!

31:23.465 --> 31:25.092
Maybe another try?

31:25.968 --> 31:27.136
Okay.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.930
And, Rose, after all this is finished,

31:30.014 --> 31:31.682
- I think you and I...
- Yeah, just open the door.

31:32.141 --> 31:33.225
Okay.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.815
Good.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.942
Now, I know it's heavy,
but don't let it tip.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.530
Very carefully place it in the case.

31:55.831 --> 31:56.874
Thank God.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.042
You can do that later.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.293
There's still another rod to get.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.004
Oh, God.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.422
Doctor, how's the door coming?

32:03.505 --> 32:06.175
Hey, how's the
"not blowing us up" coming?

32:07.885 --> 32:08.969
Fair enough.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.768
You idiot,
I am not leaving without them.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.520
- Would you stop?
- I'm going after Whitney.

32:19.313 --> 32:20.481
You got eyes on her?

32:20.564 --> 32:22.650
<i>Just get those bombs
out of here.</i>

32:22.942 --> 32:23.984
I told you,
I told you they're here.

32:24.068 --> 32:25.819
- You said they were!
- I don't know where.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.154
All night long,
you've been doing this.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.073
It's time for us to get in the car
and go home.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.325
We are not going home, Cal!
This is why we're here!

32:31.533 --> 32:32.993
- Where's Peggy?
- In pursuit.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.161
You want me to back her up?

32:34.244 --> 32:35.996
No. The bombs are our priority.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.623
Once Dr Samberly gets this door open,

32:37.706 --> 32:39.667
we need to get Jarvis and the uranium
out of here.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.422
This is insane.

32:45.506 --> 32:47.341
We're gonna get caught,
or worse, killed.

32:47.424 --> 32:48.926
I need them, Calvin.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.302
You're not getting them.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.348
Oh, you.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.058
You're good.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.977
I think there's been
a terrible misunderstanding...

32:58.060 --> 32:59.186
Shut up, Calvin.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.813
Miss Frost,
you've been exposed to a substance

33:00.896 --> 33:02.690
that I believe
is altering your physiology.

33:02.773 --> 33:05.275
Don't talk about something
that you don't understand.

33:05.359 --> 33:08.070
The SSR can help.
We can fix you if you let us.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.446
You think you can help her?

33:09.530 --> 33:10.614
Fix me?

33:11.323 --> 33:13.117
Why would I want to be fixed?

33:13.409 --> 33:16.286
I've never felt more powerful
in my entire life.

33:22.292 --> 33:23.544
I thought that would hurt more.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.755
Got it.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.636
Great work.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.596
For the record,

33:35.723 --> 33:38.350
that was nothing like baking a soufflé.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.644
Get them and the uranium to the truck.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.938
If I'm not back with Peggy
in 10 minutes, leave without us.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.314
Yes, Chief.

33:44.398 --> 33:45.816
Come on.

33:49.445 --> 33:50.696
<i>We got the rods.</i>

33:51.530 --> 33:52.948
You interfering...

33:53.032 --> 33:54.450
Last chance, Miss Frost.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.285
Same to you, Agent Carter.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.897
Oh, I'm sorry, Agent Carter.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.234
Not everyone's cut out for Hollywood.

34:31.862 --> 34:32.946
Peggy!

34:44.166 --> 34:45.918
We have to go. Now.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.921
Peggy!

34:49.421 --> 34:52.382
Oh, God. Oh, God.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.468
Peggy, stay calm. Stay calm.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.261
Just stay with me.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.185
What happened?

35:03.477 --> 35:05.020
- She fell.
- Over there.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.314
- She needs to go to a hospital.
- No! No hospital!

35:07.397 --> 35:09.525
It's okay, Peg. No hospitals, I promise.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.736
A hospital would be
extremely unsafe.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.780
There are
very powerful people after her.

35:18.408 --> 35:19.743
Peggy, stay calm.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.375
Okay, this, this is what I need.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.876
Daniel, grab some linens
from the cupboard.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.045
We need to pack the wound. Mister...

35:30.129 --> 35:31.421
Edwin Jarvis, miss, at your service.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.090
Mr Jarvis,
I need you to boil some water.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.925
Very good. Absolutely.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.847
Daniel.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.182
Daniel, I need linens.
Go to the cupboard

35:42.266 --> 35:43.433
and grab the old sheets.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.102
Right. Sorry.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.646
Okay.

35:48.981 --> 35:50.315
Heart rate is up.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.030
Bleeding appears to be under control.

35:57.114 --> 35:58.824
This would really be better
if you went to a hospital.

35:58.907 --> 36:00.284
No, no.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.578
Then, deep breaths, Peggy.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.246
'Cause this is gonna hurt.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.421
We'll need to get more uranium.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.633
You just need to call Hugh Jones
and explain the situation.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.886
- Explain the situation?
- Yes.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.429
Hugh is a good sport, Cal.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.347
Just convince him that we need to run

36:22.431 --> 36:23.765
- the Zero Matter test again.
- No, no, no!

36:23.849 --> 36:25.142
Whitney!

36:25.976 --> 36:27.978
I will not go to Hugh Jones.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.938
I will not ask another favour.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.941
I will not put myself
in another ridiculous position

36:33.025 --> 36:34.276
where I may die.

36:36.570 --> 36:38.614
You need to calm down.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.241
You are overreacting, dear.

36:41.617 --> 36:42.826
What?

36:43.744 --> 36:45.329
Because of you,

36:45.662 --> 36:48.498
I am now indebted
to a lord of the criminal underworld

36:48.582 --> 36:50.459
and at the mercy of the Council.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.045
And the Council
does not trade in mercy.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.546
If we had gotten the bombs...

36:54.630 --> 36:56.632
If we succeeded,
that would've been one thing,

36:56.715 --> 36:59.509
but this was a disaster, Whitney,

37:00.177 --> 37:01.970
and I'm not helping you any more.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.264
You need to stop. You're out of control.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.853
You'll watch your tone.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.043
Yeah, she's gonna be okay.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.587
Thanks, Rose.

37:37.047 --> 37:40.217
Rose and Dr Samberly
just finished securing the uranium rods.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.344
Well, that's a plus.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.179
At least. Mmm...

37:44.805 --> 37:46.139
Oh, God.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.019
You really scared me there.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.064
Please do not do that again.

37:54.147 --> 37:56.191
Get impaled? Yes, Chief.

38:01.822 --> 38:03.573
Your bleeding's already under control.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.701
The rebar missed everything vital.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.204
You'll need to rest,
which means no more...

38:09.288 --> 38:11.248
Well, doing
whatever the hell you were doing.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.458
You just need to be boring for a while.

38:14.418 --> 38:16.461
Ah! Good. You're awake.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.213
- I pulled the car around.
- Ah!

38:18.297 --> 38:20.340
She really shouldn't be moving around
all that much.

38:20.424 --> 38:22.926
It might be better if you stay with me
for a few days, Peggy.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.178
- I couldn't possibly ask any more of you.
- There we go.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.430
Thank you, Violet. Truly.

38:26.513 --> 38:27.848
Any time.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.769
Thank you so much.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.772
You were amazing tonight.

38:35.856 --> 38:37.107
You didn't tell me.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.485
Tell you what? About the mission?

38:40.569 --> 38:41.820
You know I can't tell you about the...

38:41.903 --> 38:43.989
No, I'm not talking about the mission.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.493
You said you moved here
because you wanted a fresh start,

38:48.577 --> 38:50.037
but that's not the whole truth, is it?

38:50.495 --> 38:52.914
- Of course it is.
- You were running away.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.918
No. No, I wasn't...

38:57.044 --> 39:00.047
God, you were running away
from Peggy.

39:02.549 --> 39:05.510
Okay, Violet,
it's not what you think it is.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.512
Well, I think you're in love with her.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.309
Aren't you, Daniel?

39:32.454 --> 39:33.705
Get the Council together.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.874
I want to call an emergency meeting.

39:37.626 --> 39:40.003
I don't care about procedure.

39:40.087 --> 39:41.630
They're gonna want to hear this.

39:49.763 --> 39:53.183
Oh... Please, Mr Jarvis, I'm fine.

39:53.475 --> 39:56.686
I'm not going to be able to breathe
with all these blankets on me as it is.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.605
I didn't think of that.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.858
I just need to sleep.
So, do you, might I add.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.652
You did disarm an atomic bomb today.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.780
Two.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.615
Two atomic bombs.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.118
Well, I think
you've earned your bedtime.

40:12.285 --> 40:13.703
Very well.

40:13.787 --> 40:15.789
But finish your tea and get some rest.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.666
Butler's orders.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.043
Mmm...

40:22.254 --> 40:24.297
You know, these adventures,

40:25.799 --> 40:29.052
they're only enjoyable
if you return from them, Miss Carter.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.556
I heartily concur, Mr Jarvis.

40:36.977 --> 40:38.061
Does it hurt?

40:39.354 --> 40:43.316
Not compared to the pain that I felt
when she touched me.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.195
The place
where Zero Matter comes from,

40:48.697 --> 40:50.866
it's dark, painful.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.118
It's not a place you want to be.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.661
Is that so?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.997
How do you know that?

40:58.415 --> 41:00.000
That's a conversation for another night.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.587
Maybe, for now,
we could just listen to some music

41:03.670 --> 41:04.880
or something?

41:04.963 --> 41:06.715
You know, rest?

41:07.382 --> 41:08.675
"Butler's orders."

41:16.433 --> 41:19.060
It's your song,
<i>I Want To Be Loved.</i>

41:21.855 --> 41:23.148
Don't we all?

41:26.943 --> 41:28.487
Peggy, I...

41:28.695 --> 41:30.447
Jason.

41:32.532 --> 41:33.783
Jason, what's happening?

41:34.117 --> 41:35.744
- I don't know.
- Jason!

41:36.369 --> 41:37.662
Jason!
