00:03.336 --> 00:05.546
Hey. You're not gonna believe this.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.549
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.718
They printed it. Yeah.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.680
I didn't know they prints jokes.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.683
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.727
It's not just about the pictures.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.438
It didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.733
Here, check it out. It's the first one too.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.485
Right there.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.863
Ha, ha.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.363
That is funny.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.700
It was also funny when I made it up.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.871
- What?
- I made that joke up.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.914
Uh, oh, oh. No, you didn't. I did.

00:41.166 --> 00:45.669
Uh, uh, oh. Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.921
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.427
What?

00:53.678 --> 00:57.389
I'm sorry. I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.103
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

01:03.521 --> 01:05.147
- No.
- Seriously?

01:05.607 --> 01:07.441
You tell a lot of jokes.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.444
Look, it's my joke.

01:10.695 --> 01:14.073
But if it makes you feel any better,
they don't print the name.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.784
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

01:16.993 --> 01:17.993
Yeah, I guess.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.913
- Hey, guys.
- Joey, Playboy printed my joke!

01:21.122 --> 01:23.957
No, it's mine! It's my joke. Call them!
They'll tell you!

01:24.209 --> 01:25.250
- My joke!
- My joke!

01:25.502 --> 01:26.877
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:27.170 --> 01:28.962
Jokes? What...?

01:29.172 --> 01:31.757
You guys know they have naked chicks
in there, right?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.635
Dude! You have got to turn on
Behind The Music.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.430
The band Heart is having a really tough
time and they may break up.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.641
Let's watch that at your place.

02:22.892 --> 02:26.311
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.523
Hey, Chandler.
You know what we should do?

02:29.774 --> 02:33.402
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.071
What? No, I want to watch this.

02:38.908 --> 02:42.578
- Did your cable go out?
- No. No, that's VH1.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.706
I gotta tell you, the music
these kids listen to today...

02:45.915 --> 02:47.416
...it's a lot of noise to me.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.336
Why is your cable out?

02:51.546 --> 02:55.174
Uh... Oh, because I haven't
really paid the bill. Heh, heh.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.886
If you need money, would you
please let me loan you some money?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.555
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

03:01.806 --> 03:05.767
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.811
- Whoa.
- I know, yeah.

03:08.062 --> 03:12.024
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

03:12.233 --> 03:15.277
And Ross gave me this great book.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.698
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch the show at his place?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.158
Sure.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.954
- Paid your phone bill?
- Not so much.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.755
- Hey.
- Oh.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.590
It's only you.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.968
- What are you doing?
- We are looking at a Playboy.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.386
I want to look too!

03:44.682 --> 03:45.974
Yikes!

03:47.602 --> 03:50.979
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

03:51.564 --> 03:54.233
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman...

03:54.484 --> 03:56.735
...she has lost her clothes.

03:56.986 --> 04:01.990
So she rides naked on the horse, she's
crying out, "Where are they? Where are they?"

04:03.243 --> 04:06.620
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.999
Oh. Yeah.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.835
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn...

04:14.087 --> 04:16.713
- ...lift up your shirt and bend over?
- Yeah.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.512
You see, now, I would date this girl.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.348
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.768
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.520
I got a question.

04:31.854 --> 04:35.399
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

04:36.317 --> 04:37.943
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.569
Rachel.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.738
What?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.200
I don't know.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.286
Me neither.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.959
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.419
Yeah.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.841
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.594
So you heard it, you repeated it...

05:04.846 --> 05:07.514
...so that must mean you wrote it.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.352
Oh, you guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say...

05:12.603 --> 05:15.397
...I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.065
What?

05:17.775 --> 05:19.026
You didn't get it?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.528
The doctor is a monkey.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.657
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.871
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.165
Your joke?

05:33.374 --> 05:36.293
Well, I think the Hef would disagree.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.837
Which is why he sent me a check...

05:39.088 --> 05:41.298
...for $100.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.843
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

05:45.219 --> 05:47.137
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.265
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller...

05:50.516 --> 05:53.310
...that I am a published writer.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.771
Well, she'll know that you stole the joke.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.481
You gonna follow me down there?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.524
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna go now.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.109
Okay.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.822
- Here you go.
- Oh.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.366
Ah.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.618
Uh, Gunther?

06:10.119 --> 06:12.621
I can't pay for this now,
because I'm not working.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.499
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like...

06:15.708 --> 06:18.210
...paying for stuff, so...

06:19.879 --> 06:21.963
Well, if you want, you can work here.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.049
Uh, I don't know.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.509
It's just...

06:26.010 --> 06:29.262
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

06:29.472 --> 06:32.391
And to go from that to this,
it's just...

06:32.642 --> 06:35.435
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.437
Okay. But the money's good.

06:37.688 --> 06:40.524
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.486
What?

06:44.695 --> 06:46.780
Flexible hours.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.825
Maybe I could be a waiter.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.451
Could I use the phone?

06:58.751 --> 07:00.043
She picked Rachel.

07:00.294 --> 07:04.714
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.051
He took my joke. He just took it.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.513
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.473
Phoebe picking Rachel.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.600
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.687
You know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.691
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

07:22.942 --> 07:26.403
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.905
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.408
- Picking Rachel.
- That's right.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.620
Did you hear something?

07:35.872 --> 07:40.000
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain and stealing my thoughts.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.878
It's coming from the living room.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.385
I finished my book.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.604
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.898
Don't you guys look cute.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.066
You guys make a cute couple.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.195
Monica, what are you doing?

08:08.446 --> 08:12.491
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place the other day.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.035
Remember?
When you picked Rachel over me?

08:15.286 --> 08:17.787
That was funny. Ha, ha, ha.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.624
- It was kind of funny.
- It wasn't funny at all!

08:22.126 --> 08:23.793
Why would you do that?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.962
Why didn't you pick me?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.506
Fine.

08:27.882 --> 08:31.885
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you...

08:32.094 --> 08:33.970
...is just, you know, you're...

08:34.639 --> 08:36.722
...high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.392
That is completely untrue.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.937
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.774
You write out a list,
and we'll go through it point by point.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.070
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.575
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more...

08:55.826 --> 08:58.119
...flexible and mellow. That's all.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.750
Well, people are different.

09:04.835 --> 09:08.880
Yeah, Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.927
What? Are you saying, that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.347
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.768
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.853
You're not invited to lunch!

09:24.105 --> 09:26.565
What do you think?
I think that's pretty strong.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.025
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.902
Pssh.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.780
You start working on that list.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.868
- I cannot believe her.
- I know. Where do you want to eat?

09:39.078 --> 09:43.623
- Oh... Oh, I love that Japanese place.
- I'm sick of Japanese. Not going there.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.334
- Wherever you want to go is cool.
- All right.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.632
Oh, hey, Gunther...

09:52.883 --> 09:54.467
...check this out.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.681
Yeah. Man, that Chandler cracks me up.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.813
Hey, Ross, you want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.441
- Yeah. I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
- Sure.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.276
- Coffee?
- No.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.069
Coffee? I'm going up there.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.529
- No.
- No, thank you.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.491
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.243
I'd love ice water.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.995
You got it.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.706
Joey, what are you doing?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.291
Just being friendly.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.046
Joey, you're not supposed to go back there.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.256
No, it's okay. Right, Gunther?

10:34.508 --> 10:36.176
Don't wink at me.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.304
And put on your apron.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.515
Okay. Heh, heh.

10:42.767 --> 10:46.394
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.440
- Joey, do you work here?
- No.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.192
- Waiter.
- Yeah!

10:58.783 --> 11:01.660
Joey, what's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

11:01.869 --> 11:03.078
Uh...

11:05.122 --> 11:09.376
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.836
It's supposed to go
in the other direction.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.382
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.803
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

11:20.054 --> 11:23.973
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it. Right?

11:24.225 --> 11:27.435
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

11:27.645 --> 11:28.770
It'll be great.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.439
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.149
Why would it be weird?

11:33.401 --> 11:36.361
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.572
Okay. It doesn't seem that weird.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.492
Seriously, I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.454
See, now it's weird again.

11:47.164 --> 11:50.583
I think it's great. You're gonna make
a lot of money. Here's your first tip.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.004
Don't eat yellow snow. Ha, ha, ha.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.300
15, coffeehouse.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.389
This is great. Finally, I have
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.559
Let me tell you some things
I learned working at the coffeehouse.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.854
First, the customer is always right.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.566
A smile goes a long way.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.988
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

12:21.949 --> 12:22.991
Thanks, Rach.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.746
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

12:27.997 --> 12:31.082
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers, huh?

12:31.292 --> 12:33.376
It's all about turnover.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.379
Joey.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.548
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.135
I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it right now.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.472
And since you wait,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.897
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.690
Okay.

12:55.983 --> 12:59.068
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.197
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.115
But you know what we decided you are?

13:04.366 --> 13:08.077
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.454
Ha!

13:11.540 --> 13:13.333
That's true, I am flaky.

13:14.835 --> 13:18.421
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

13:18.672 --> 13:20.298
Yeah, totally.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.676
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.805
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.390
That's great. Good for you guys.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.811
- I am not high maintenance!
- I am not a pushover!

13:34.355 --> 13:36.564
- Who said you were?
- You did!

13:36.774 --> 13:39.150
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.616
Hey, Gunther.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.244
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.996
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.708
Really? I like your natural color.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.714
It's a great part. Check it out.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.300
I wait for him in this bar and save his seat.
Listen.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.637
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."

14:09.807 --> 14:13.852
- That's the whole part?
- Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but...

14:14.228 --> 14:16.354
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.273
Oh, man.

14:18.482 --> 14:22.277
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken."

14:22.528 --> 14:25.822
- Excuse me.
- No, I didn't mean you.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.323
But you believed me, huh?

14:28.242 --> 14:31.411
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.746
So you'd hire me, right?

14:34.832 --> 14:36.624
For what?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.878
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

14:40.129 --> 14:42.881
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.258
What?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.093
It's for the kids.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.096
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

14:50.347 --> 14:53.933
Yeah. It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.019
I'm sure you all read about it.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.740
- It's my joke.
- It's my joke.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.786
It's my joke.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.624
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.501
- No. Let's have Monica decide.
- Yeah.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.795
- Hey, Mon!
- Mon, get out here!

15:23.047 --> 15:25.006
- Monica?
- Okay.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.550
You have to help us decide
whose joke this is.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.801
Why do I have to?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.179
- You're the only one that can be fair.
- Yeah.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.306
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.642
But I'm your brother. We're family.

15:35.851 --> 15:39.687
That's the most important thing
in the world.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.441
Don't try to sway her.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.694
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.033
- Okay, let's go.
- All right.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.870
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke...

15:56.121 --> 16:00.083
...then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.043
Chandler, you go first.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.672
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.424
- Did I meet him at Christmas?
- Can I finish my story?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.134
Do you want me to pick you?

16:11.387 --> 16:14.639
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.060
Two babies.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.232
- Continue.
- Okay.

16:24.441 --> 16:29.153
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

16:29.405 --> 16:34.450
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.415
Are you kidding?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.543
Okay, look, I study evolution.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.211
Remember? Evolution.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.005
Monkey into man.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.923
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...

16:49.174 --> 16:52.176
...I had a monkey.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.264
I'm Dr. Monkey!

16:59.018 --> 17:01.352
- I'm not arguing with that.
- All right.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.730
I've heard enough. I've made my decision.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.565
- Oh!
- Okay, so what...? Do tell.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.983
You are both idiots.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.238
The joke is not funny,
and it's offensive to women.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.615
And doctors. And monkeys.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.161
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

17:18.412 --> 17:23.249
You should be arguing over who gets blamed
for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.916
Now, let it go.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.002
The joke sucks.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.761
- It's your joke.
- It is not.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.696
- Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
- Hi.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.449
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.076
Why don't you tell them...

17:58.285 --> 18:01.829
...what you were telling me earlier about me
not being high maintenance.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.503
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.257
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.554
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance...

18:18.806 --> 18:21.432
...is merely attention to detail...

18:21.642 --> 18:22.975
...and...

18:24.103 --> 18:26.437
...generosity of spirit.

18:28.273 --> 18:33.027
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.987
Really? I've heard better.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.117
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them, Chandler.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.411
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

18:42.663 --> 18:44.622
Look, I am not high maintenance!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.707
I am not. Chandler!

18:49.419 --> 18:50.753
You're high maintenance.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.881
You are on my list!

18:55.425 --> 18:57.426
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not...

18:57.678 --> 19:00.471
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.973
And that's good.

19:02.224 --> 19:06.102
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good...

19:06.353 --> 19:08.187
...at making you feel better about that.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.357
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance...

19:11.608 --> 19:14.193
...but it's okay, because I like...

19:15.946 --> 19:17.947
...maintaining you.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.583
I didn't even tell him to say that.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.960
- Aw.
- Okay.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.630
- All right, you're off my list.
- I'm off the list.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.299
Phoebe?

19:37.509 --> 19:40.678
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.638
Because I have the best boyfriend.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.560
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.273
How'd the audition go?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.900
Oh, not good. No.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.820
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so...

19:58.071 --> 19:59.947
Wow, that is a bad audition.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.660
Well, how did you lose your job here?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.162
I had the audition...

20:06.413 --> 20:10.041
...but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.418
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.504
He left work in the middle of the day
to do a personal errand...

20:15.714 --> 20:19.091
...and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.635
That's not right.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.012
What are you gonna do?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.932
Joey, you can't let him get away with that.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.310
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say something to him...

20:29.561 --> 20:32.855
I really shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something to him!

20:36.151 --> 20:39.278
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

20:39.529 --> 20:43.699
- That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
- Okay.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.372
- What?
- He can have his job back.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.834
That's right,
he can have his job back.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.838
Glad we got that all straightened out.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.466
There you go, Joey.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.136
- Got your job back.
- That's great. Thanks, Rach.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.223
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

21:07.933 --> 21:10.142
- Rach, you're in my seat.
- I'm sorry.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.485
Hey, I never got to hear who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

21:19.820 --> 21:23.114
- I'd pick you, Phoebe.
- Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.907
Yeah, I kind of thought.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.289
Never.
- It would totally be you.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.332
Hey.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.877
A question: If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with...

21:37.129 --> 21:38.587
...who would you pick?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.214
- No way.
- I'm not answering.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.966
Joey.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.471
No way, I'm not answering that.
