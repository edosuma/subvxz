-Okay! Okay!

00:18.601 --> 00:20.603
-Relax!
-[Ward] You understand? Just stop!

00:20.687 --> 00:21.771
It wasn't my fault!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.523
It was your father, okay?

00:23.606 --> 00:25.817
It was your father that tried to change--

00:25.900 --> 00:28.445

Don't move!

02:09.963 --> 02:11.589
I swear I'll kill you, Ward.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.633
Do it. Do it, John B.

02:14.884 --> 02:15.969
I know you want to.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.137
Fuck, shut up.

02:17.595 --> 02:18.680
But then...

02:19.931 --> 02:21.558
you'd have my body to deal with.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.978
Believe me,
it's more complicated than it seems.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.896

[sniffs] I need to know.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.073
The night your father disappeared...

06:48.074 --> 06:49.450
<i>I came home early from work</i>

06:49.534 --> 06:52.286
<i>-to find Scooter talking to Ward.</i>
-[Ward] ...what happened, it's like...

06:52.370 --> 06:55.540
[sobbing] I didn't want him to get hurt.
I wasn't trying to hurt him!

06:55.623 --> 06:58.501
It was a mistake.
It was just a stupid accident.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.460
It was just...

07:00.461 --> 07:03.131
He tried to change the deal on me,
and I wasn't gonna let him,

07:03.214 --> 07:05.174
and so he flipped out, and it just--

07:06.342 --> 07:08.845
I didn't mean to... hurt him.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.972
-I didn't mean anything to happen to him.
-Okay, okay.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.392
Slow down, C.
Okay, start at the beginning.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.942
[Ward] <i>It was this morning.</i>
<i>Big John and I were out on the open water.</i>

07:25.111 --> 07:27.822
[Ward] John, you brought me
out here to talk, man, so let's talk.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.616
I figured it might be good news.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.080
You found it?

07:36.747 --> 07:37.707
You found it.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.876
[laughing] You found it!

07:41.169 --> 07:43.463
No.<i> </i>No. I need some assurances.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.673
What are you talking about? Yes, okay!

07:45.756 --> 07:47.216
You have assurances. Yes.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.593
I need legal assurances.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.637
What legal assurances, John?
We're partners.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.890
-It's a fifty-fifty thing, and--
-It's not fifty-fifty.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.349
I never agreed to that.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.809
I spent 20 years on this.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.103
Ward, you just got involved.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.400
Don't do this. [chuckles]

08:04.484 --> 08:05.526
Twenty percent.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.487
Twenty percent, my ass! No!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.614
You took my money, and you used my boats,

08:09.697 --> 08:11.949
and you used everything
that I was giving you.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.202
-That's when you found it.
-Twenty percent is reasonable.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.411
-It is not reasonable!
-It is!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.955
I don't give a shit what's reasonable.
You promised me!

08:18.039 --> 08:19.790
-It was my money.
-It's my research!

08:19.874 --> 08:22.543
In 20 years,
you didn't find a goddamn thing.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.962
I knew you would do this.
You've always been greedy, Ward.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.714
-I'm not doing it!
-Yes, you are! You--

08:26.797 --> 08:27.882

Where is it?

08:37.725 --> 08:39.727
-Where's the gold?
-You'll never find it.

08:43.689 --> 08:44.565
What...

08:45.691 --> 08:46.776
Jesus, John.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.529
-What happened?
-Ward?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.364
[Ward] Okay, all right.
Hang on, buddy.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.200
Okay, all right. Okay, that's all right.
It's all right, buddy.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.452
-[John moaning]
-It's okay. It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.954
It's all right. Let me see.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.874
I'm gonna call somebody, okay?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.543
Okay, John?

10:46.312 --> 10:49.815
I would have been in court for years.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.734
And for what?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.321
Here's the thing, Scooter...

10:55.404 --> 10:56.781
[sniffles]

10:56.864 --> 10:58.783
And I'm gonna need your help on this.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.951
Big John is gone...

11:07.875 --> 11:09.835
but the goddamn gold is still there,

11:15.466 --> 11:16.634
and he was close.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.180
And now, we're close.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.813
[John B] <i>So, he stole my father's map...</i>

11:32.900 --> 11:35.361
then he tossed his body into the sea?

11:38.989 --> 11:40.199
He sunk your father's boat

11:40.741 --> 11:42.368
where no one would ever find it.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.248
And they began to look for the gold
every day for nine months.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.833
When Agatha built up,

11:48.916 --> 11:50.626
there was only one place
they hadn't looked.

-[detector beeping]
-[Lana] <i>I begged him not to go,</i>

11:59.343 --> 12:02.847
<i>but he said that Ward was worried</i>
<i>the storm would wash everything away.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:08.936
<i>But Scooter did find somethin' out there.</i>

12:10.271 --> 12:11.689
<i>Not what he expected.</i>

12:17.945 --> 12:19.947
[thunder crashing]

12:30.124 --> 12:32.418
[Lana] He wasn't dead
when Ward dumped him.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.420
[crying softly]

12:39.717 --> 12:41.218
[Lana] <i>He made it to shore.</i>

12:49.852 --> 12:51.270

13:18.422 --> 13:20.508
[Lana] <i>And the last thing he ever did...</i>

13:22.593 --> 13:23.677
<i>was for you.</i>

[breathing shakily]

13:42.154 --> 13:44.031
[Lana] I am so sorry, John B.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.577
I should have told you a long time ago.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.333
But you can't say anything.
He's dangerous.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.752
-He's capable of anything. Don't--
-[John B] I don't care!

-[Peterkin] What happened to your arm?
-Damn Routledge kid.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.978
Uh... yeah, come on in.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.191
All I'm trying to do at this point
is calm him down.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.735
I follow him into the galley.
I can't even believe it.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.279
He fires the goddamn thing at me.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.781
I'm trying to take care of this.
He runs off.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.283
He steals my Jet Ski.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.118
He's out there, God knows where.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.954
The guy's dangerous.
I'm worried about my family.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.790
I'm worried about my daughter.
They had some kind of thing, apparently.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.252
Let's write it up.
In the meantime, you go home.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.254
-We'll find him.
-[sighing]

14:41.672 --> 14:42.506
Thank you.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.259
Yeah.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.724
-[Shoupe] Here, buddy--
-[Ward] You write it. I'm goin' home.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.058
[Shoupe] Get that looked at.

-Feels good.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.355

-[Pope] Yeah, where is he?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.110
I got my scholarship interview tomorrow.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.361
We gotta get this done!

15:04.695 --> 15:06.155
[JJ] Speak of the devil. Hey!

15:06.864 --> 15:09.450
Dude, I set up the entire winch
to pull up the gold and everything.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.368
-[Pope] No, he did not. I did that.
-[Kie] Hey.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.871
-[Pope] Hey.
-[JJ] Okay, that's it?

15:13.954 --> 15:15.789
Uh... what's that all about?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.292
I was gonna ask you the same question.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.044
[clattering]

15:21.879 --> 15:23.631
You all right, man? What-- what's up?

15:23.714 --> 15:25.299
[Kie] What are you looking for?

15:25.925 --> 15:26.926
[JJ] Bro, what's going on?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.889
-John B, what do you need the gun for?
-Just-- No!

15:31.972 --> 15:34.224
-[JJ] Talk to us!
-[Kie] John B, chill!

15:34.642 --> 15:36.644
-What are you doing?
-What, are you JJ now?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.146
Shi-- Are you okay?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.899

[engine revving]

15:45.653 --> 15:46.904
John B, what the hell?

15:46.987 --> 15:48.072
Ward knows about the gold.

15:48.822 --> 15:49.865
He killed my dad.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.913
[Kie] John B!

15:57.164 --> 15:58.040
[JJ] Shit!

16:31.115 --> 16:32.741
[door opens]

16:38.497 --> 16:40.040
John B, why do you have a gun?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.919
Did you tell your dad about the gold?

16:45.713 --> 16:48.007
-Where's that coming from?
-Answer the question.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.550
-About the gold.
-No.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.427
No, of course not.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.221
Then how'd he know? Hm?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.516
-[Sarah gasps] I--
-Answer me!

16:57.599 --> 16:58.642
John B, you're scaring me.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.728
Is life outside the Bubble Wrap
scary to you?

17:00.811 --> 17:02.396
-[Ward] Sarah!
-[John B gasps]

17:03.022 --> 17:03.856
Hey.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.793
Oh, Christ.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.212
[Sarah] Where are you taking me?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.965
-Somewhere where we can talk.
-[Rose] Sarah!

17:30.382 --> 17:32.051
-[groans]
-[Sarah] John B, what's going on?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.098
Your dad... killed my father.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.061
-What?
-I need you to listen to me.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.647
Look, I think they were working together
to find the Royal Merchant.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.399
There was some sort of conflict,

17:47.483 --> 17:50.819
and-- and nobody knows what happened
to my dad except for Scooter Grubbs.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.154
-Stop.
-[John B] Look, he was--

17:52.237 --> 17:53.655
-he was a part of this, okay?
-Just--

17:53.739 --> 17:55.532
-[John B] I figured it out on the boat.
-Stop--

17:55.616 --> 17:57.576
-Just--
-And your dad, he tried to kill me, Sarah.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.912
-He wouldn't hurt anyone!
-[John B] He tried to kill me.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.747
[Sarah] He told me you stabbed him.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.458
What are you talking about?
He killed my father.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.086
No. I don-- I don't believe you.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.547
No, you're a liar.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.216
-Get off of me!
-[John B] Look at me.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.425
-[door opens]
-[Sarah] No!

18:13.842 --> 18:15.052
[Ward] Sarah!

18:15.469 --> 18:16.678
-[door closes]
-[Sarah sobbing]

18:16.762 --> 18:18.931
[Rose] Sarah! Ward, she's here!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.016
Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.769
[Ward] Sweetie, what are you doing?
What are you doing out here?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.868
Pope? Kie? [sniffs]

18:43.997 --> 18:44.915
Hello?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.295
[sobbing]

18:56.885 --> 18:58.303
[sobbing]

19:10.440 --> 19:11.733
[whispers] I miss you.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.050
Goodbye, Dad.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.536
[thunder rumbling]

20:04.620 --> 20:06.371
[Ward] John B was here, wasn't he?

20:07.289 --> 20:08.123
No.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.461
-Sweetheart, please don't lie to me.
-Okay, so don't lie to me.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.088
-I'm not.
-Then tell me what happened on the boat!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.048
Sarah!

20:17.090 --> 20:19.968
I wanted to take the boy fishing.
You saw that, all right?

20:20.344 --> 20:22.846
I did it
because a boy needs a father figure.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.681
So, out we go, and it was great. It was.

20:24.765 --> 20:28.185
And then he just starts... drinking,
and then, at a certain part,

20:28.268 --> 20:32.814
he starts accusing me of these...
insane things.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.525
And the more I try to calm him down,
the angrier he gets,

20:35.609 --> 20:37.236
till finally, he attacks me!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.322
-John B wouldn't do that.
-You don't believe this?

20:40.405 --> 20:42.950
Do you wanna see it again?
Where he stabbed me with a spear?

20:43.033 --> 20:45.202
Do you want to see the one
on the deck of the Druthers?

20:45.285 --> 20:47.037
-You want to go out there? Let's go!
-Stop!

20:47.120 --> 20:49.915
-[Ward] Right now!
-Please-- please stop yelling. [sobs]

20:50.916 --> 20:52.084
[sighs]

20:54.294 --> 20:55.337
[exhales]

20:57.256 --> 20:58.882
I'm sorry, baby. I don't mean to yell.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.346
John B is not who you think he is, okay?

21:05.097 --> 21:09.184
I mean, if you heard the crazy things
he was saying on that boat.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.478
-Like what?
-Like I killed his father.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.064
Like that. Me.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.441
Did he tell you that?

21:18.860 --> 21:19.736
[Ward sighs]

21:22.531 --> 21:24.658
I know you have feelings for John B,

21:25.242 --> 21:27.619
and I know how strong that can be,

21:28.203 --> 21:29.496
especially at your age...

21:33.542 --> 21:35.502
but, sweetheart,
he's dangerous right now.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.715
I don't know what he would do to you
if you made him angry,

21:39.798 --> 21:42.050
and I just... can't have that.

21:42.926 --> 21:46.430
I need you to promise me
that you'll stay completely away from him,

21:46.513 --> 21:49.016
and to stay here
until this thing all blows over.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.019
[sighs]

21:53.353 --> 21:54.438
[sniffles] No.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.483
I need to be alone.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.610
I think that's best.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.405
[sighs]

22:06.950 --> 22:08.285
[door closes]

22:09.870 --> 22:11.038
[sighs]

22:15.000 --> 22:16.001
[sighs]

22:23.633 --> 22:27.554
New pocket listing.
Forty acres on Figure Eight.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.556
<i>Got robbed by some kids.</i>

22:29.639 --> 22:33.143
Four hundred million dollars.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.478
It's all there.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.533
[chuckles]

22:54.581 --> 22:55.957
[laughs]

22:58.377 --> 23:00.462
[JJ] What now?
We just go up to the front door and ask,

23:00.545 --> 23:02.339
"Hey, have you seen John B?"

23:02.422 --> 23:04.800
Look, he lives at Tannyhill now.
It's plausible.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.593
-Look, we can play dumb.
-[JJ] Play dumb?

23:06.676 --> 23:07.636
It's pretty late.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.932
Look, I've never seen John B like that.
We should honestly be going to the cops.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.600
The cop-- Yeah, and say what, Kie?

23:13.683 --> 23:16.103
We're worried about our friend
because he's on a rampage

23:16.186 --> 23:18.647
because Ward Cameron killed Big John?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.899
-Like, they're not gonna believe us!
-Hey, I see Ward.

23:21.942 --> 23:22.776
Let me see.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.489
Doesn't look dead to me. Let's go home.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.448
-[JJ] Wait.
-What?

23:28.532 --> 23:31.493
Uh... Okay.
Obviously, Mr. Cameron is fine,

23:31.952 --> 23:35.414
and even if John B was here,
he isn't now, okay?

23:35.831 --> 23:38.458
Plus, I have the biggest,
most important moment of my life

23:38.542 --> 23:39.626
in six hours.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.545
Yeah, well, our friend is in trouble.

23:41.628 --> 23:42.879
I'm in trouble.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.798
Guys, I haven't been home in three days.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.134
My dad's probably put all my shit
on the street by now.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.219
Okay, so that's it?

23:51.638 --> 23:54.349
In a time of need, you're just gonna bail?
You're just gonna walk away?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.726
Okay, yo, guys,
can we not do this right now?

23:56.810 --> 24:00.188
Hey, I have a scholarship interview
in the morning.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.399
-I can't--
-Okay, well, what about John B?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.901
Why is it always about John B?

24:06.903 --> 24:07.737
[sighs]

24:08.155 --> 24:09.906
It's not always about John B.

24:09.990 --> 24:10.866
You're so stupid.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.243
-It would be any of you in this situation.
-Oh, bullshit!

24:13.326 --> 24:14.995
-Guys--
-This is about friendship.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.204
[JJ] Bring it down.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.874
Look, this is about Pogues for life.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.876
What about forensic pathology, huh?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.545
-Forensic pathology?
-It's my life. Everything I've worked for.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.173
-That's your priority?
-Stop the moral high ground bullshit?

24:26.256 --> 24:27.382
-[JJ] Pope, come on.
-No.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.885
-Excuse me?
-No, no. She has no room to talk.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.971
Where were you when Big John went missing?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.599
You weren't there.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.977
You weren't there for John B.
You weren't there for any of us.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.687
Remember your Kook year?

24:40.770 --> 24:41.688
Dude.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.857
Yeah, you forgot about us.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.109
-Now you feel guilty.
-Give me a break.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.444
-Hey!
-[Kie] That what you need?

24:47.527 --> 24:49.654
-[Pope] Come on.
-[Kie] You need a break? Move!

24:49.738 --> 24:51.698
[JJ] Hey! Yo, yo, yo,
cut it out, all right?

24:51.781 --> 24:54.242
If I'm the one mediating,
we've hit rock bottom.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.412
Bow, now.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.413
Go!

25:00.999 --> 25:02.709
-Pope, I'll drop you off.
-[engine starts]

25:14.804 --> 25:16.097
[door closes]

25:19.059 --> 25:20.143
You waited up.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.187
You left?

25:23.563 --> 25:24.856
Because I hadn't noticed.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.444
Oh... right.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.905
Right, um...

25:32.948 --> 25:36.159
when you quit on me at Midsummers...

25:37.327 --> 25:38.370
you vanished.

25:39.579 --> 25:40.997
For-- for three days.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.794
And your mama was cryin' for two of them.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.130
So it-- it's...
it's comin' back to me now.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.676
Pope, is that you?
We're just glad you're back, honey.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.094
It's all right.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.096
Hell no, it ain't all right.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.100
[Pope] I'm sorry.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.477
You sorry, all right.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.277
Don't do that to us again. Hear me?

26:10.360 --> 26:11.653
-I'm sorry, Mama.
-[sobs]

26:12.237 --> 26:13.446
[sighs]

26:15.824 --> 26:16.908
[whispers] Go on.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.631
[sighs]

26:47.689 --> 26:48.857
[sighs]

27:16.718 --> 27:18.136
No. No!

27:34.736 --> 27:35.862
[John B gasps]

27:36.363 --> 27:38.365
[grunting]

27:44.371 --> 27:45.538
No...

27:45.622 --> 27:46.790
No! No!

27:46.873 --> 27:47.916
No.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.084
[yells] No!

27:49.167 --> 27:51.336
No! No!

27:51.419 --> 27:53.922
[screams] No! No!

28:19.239 --> 28:20.323
[clears throat] Thank you.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.290
Are you gonna wait?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.835
[laughs]

28:31.918 --> 28:33.586
Are you kiddin', man? I got--

28:33.670 --> 28:36.464
I got three palms
blocking a-- a private airstrip.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.468
Cameron's plane is too big for the runway,
and it just-- [tuts]

28:40.552 --> 28:42.095
-Cameron?
-Yeah.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.055
He's a thief!

28:44.889 --> 28:46.182
Aren't they all?

28:47.600 --> 28:48.852
But the money's good.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.395
He's payin' Guffy double.

28:50.478 --> 28:52.814
Guffy passed it on to me
if I can get it done this afternoon.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.774
I-- I need the money, son. I...

28:56.401 --> 28:58.027
[sighs] Look...

28:58.528 --> 29:01.531
I know better than to try
to give you a pep talk, okay?

29:02.323 --> 29:04.743
But... but if you get this, though...

29:07.162 --> 29:08.121
you'll be set...

29:09.122 --> 29:09.956
for life.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.086
No pressure, now.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.672
Just don't screw it up.

29:18.339 --> 29:19.174
All right?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.229
[lighter sparking]

29:35.648 --> 29:36.900
[Wheezie] Rafe?

29:39.486 --> 29:40.320
[Rafe] I'm sorry.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.404
[chuckles]

29:41.488 --> 29:43.531
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.743
Did you want some, or...

29:47.535 --> 29:49.829
You legitimately just offered me drugs?

29:50.413 --> 29:51.247
I'm 13.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.167
Uh...

29:54.250 --> 29:55.835
[Wheezie] This is a sweet crib.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.463
How'd you con the Glissons
into letting you crash here?

29:58.546 --> 30:02.133
I, uh...
I didn't tell them is how, all right?

30:02.801 --> 30:06.638
They're in Sun Valley all summer,
so keep a lid on it, please.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.140
I mean, as long as you let me stay here
whenever I want.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.058
Yeah.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.227
Dad trying to kick you out too?

30:12.310 --> 30:15.897
[sighs] Worse. I am officially
the least favorite daughter.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.066
Mm-hm. [chuckles]

30:18.149 --> 30:21.528
Sarah and Dad are going to the Bahamas,
and did they invite me?

30:22.111 --> 30:22.987
Nope.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.537
Wait. They're-- they're going
to the Bahama house?

30:30.620 --> 30:31.746
In summer?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.873
Yeah. I mean, according to Rose,

30:33.957 --> 30:35.792
-it's "business."
-Mm.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.794
I mean, they're all up in
some new development,

30:37.877 --> 30:41.339
and for some super-secret reason,
they're going to the Bahamas.

30:41.422 --> 30:43.466
You know, I-- I know about, like...

30:43.550 --> 30:46.970
a billion times more about the business
than she does.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.555
What-- what is this?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.598
[Wheezie] Ugh. We're the black sheep.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.809
-Get used to it, Rafe.
-Yeah.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.894
-Baa!
-[Rafe] Shut up, okay?

30:54.978 --> 30:56.896
-Baa!
-Hey, shut up!

30:56.980 --> 30:58.606
Wheezie, I told you to shut up, okay?

30:59.148 --> 31:00.525
Don't tell me to shut up!

31:04.237 --> 31:06.322
Here, my life savings.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.826
[mutters] Life savings...

31:10.451 --> 31:11.786
Life savings...

31:13.162 --> 31:14.497
Oh... oh, shit.

31:16.833 --> 31:17.834
I'll pay you back.

31:18.793 --> 31:19.627
Whenever.

31:22.672 --> 31:26.551
I know this looks really bad right now
and everything, but...

31:28.386 --> 31:31.055
Like, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna my shit together, okay?

31:31.347 --> 31:32.807
Like, I will. [sniffs]

31:32.891 --> 31:35.310
-I'm gonna get it tight, like, you know...
-[bangs table]

31:35.393 --> 31:36.603
Like, real tight. [laughs]

31:36.686 --> 31:37.645
You'll see.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.399
Um...

31:41.482 --> 31:42.567
Yeah.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.615
[man] And how have you been
keeping busy all summer?

31:49.198 --> 31:52.410
Are you taking any classes
or interning anywhere?

31:53.411 --> 31:54.579
Independent study.

31:56.456 --> 32:00.293
We were looking for an old shipwreck,
the Royal Merchant.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.339
And did you find it?

32:04.422 --> 32:06.424
[both laugh]

32:06.883 --> 32:08.635
Yes, I did, actually.

32:10.219 --> 32:11.137
Uh, me and my friends.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.348
Oh, really?

32:14.974 --> 32:16.059
Yes, really.

32:18.728 --> 32:22.398
Denmark Tanny, the--
the fugitive slave turned free man,

32:22.857 --> 32:24.817
he was the sole survivor
of the Royal Merchant,

32:24.901 --> 32:26.194
and he brought the gold to shore.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.279
And you found evidence of this.

32:28.696 --> 32:29.781
Definitive proof.

32:33.701 --> 32:36.621
Are you trying to get us to believe
that you found the Royal Merchant?

32:37.622 --> 32:39.832
And if so, where's the gold?

32:50.718 --> 32:51.803
It was too heavy...

32:54.472 --> 32:55.348
Excuse me.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.446
[Kie] You sure he got everything?

33:11.447 --> 33:12.532
[John B] Every bar.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.242
The whole enchilada.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.119
[grunts]

33:19.330 --> 33:22.041
Look, it's not like I expected
a happy ending or some shit.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.835
-John B--
-What, Kie?

33:23.918 --> 33:25.795
It's a hairline fracture. Who cares?

33:25.878 --> 33:28.297
[Kie] You should care.
Your arm's gonna be messed up for life.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.716
It's fine. See?

33:29.799 --> 33:31.426
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Pope] Guys!

33:31.509 --> 33:33.261
[panting] Guys!

33:33.928 --> 33:37.390
Oh! Oh! Oh, God. I ran all the way here.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.476
-You all right?
-[JJ] How was the interview, Pope?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.936
Don't ask. [grunts]

33:42.020 --> 33:43.062
-Awesome.
-JB...

33:43.146 --> 33:44.480
[panting]

33:44.564 --> 33:46.649
Look, I'm sorry, dude.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.943
-About everything.
-It's fine.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.820
But-- but I don't have a lot of time,

33:50.903 --> 33:53.990
and-- and I have information
that is tactically relevant.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.325
So, before I had my interview,

33:56.409 --> 33:58.411
my dad said he was going down
to the private airstrip

33:58.494 --> 34:00.872
to cut palms for Cameron's big plane.

34:01.789 --> 34:02.915
Because it was too heavy,

34:02.999 --> 34:04.792
it needed a longer landing strip
to take off.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.211
So, I'm there sitting in my interview,
thinking to myself,

34:07.295 --> 34:10.298
"Hm. Why would Cameron need
a longer airstrip to take off?

34:11.758 --> 34:14.218
What could be so heavy to weigh it down?"

34:15.595 --> 34:17.096
-Gold.
-[John B] That's right.

34:17.430 --> 34:18.264
Exactly.

34:18.681 --> 34:23.436
Guys, this is our chance,
but it leaves tonight, and we have to go.

34:23.519 --> 34:24.687
Guys, we can't give up now.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.522
What's the plan, big man?

34:27.231 --> 34:28.941
We're gonna steal that shit back.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.115
[laughing]

34:36.199 --> 34:38.409
-[Pope] Let's do this!
-[Kie] Come on, boys!

34:39.869 --> 34:41.662
[Rose] Sweetie? Car's packed.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.580
Yeah.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.166
Okay, then what are you doing?

34:45.249 --> 34:48.753
I'm just... takin' a moment, all right?

34:48.836 --> 34:49.921
[Rose] Okay.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.591
[Ward] God knows if I'm ever gonna get
to see this view again.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.260
[Rose] Oh, Jesus, Ward.
Come on. Don't be melodramatic.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.222
I'm not being melodramatic, all right?
The boy knows about his father.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.640
-What is to know?
-Ugh...

35:00.723 --> 35:02.767
-It was an accident.
-What is to know? What--

35:03.559 --> 35:06.771
For one solid year,
John B has gone to bed every single night

35:06.854 --> 35:08.606
wondering what happened to his father.

35:08.689 --> 35:09.732
That's suffering.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.444
And that was my fault, and he knows that.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.489
Okay, but what choice did you have, Ward?

35:20.576 --> 35:21.410
Right.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.454
Okay, so don't worry about it.

35:27.083 --> 35:27.917
[sighs]

35:28.000 --> 35:29.669
Did you talk to the people in Nassau?

35:30.837 --> 35:31.671
Yeah.

35:32.338 --> 35:34.215
Caribbean National
is set to take possession

35:34.298 --> 35:37.009
-as soon as my wheels hit the ground.
-Okay, then it's done.

35:38.052 --> 35:39.804
Baby, you did it. It's over.

35:39.887 --> 35:41.305
[chuckles] Come on.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.307
Congratulations.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.228
Now get going.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.570
[Ward sighs]

36:00.366 --> 36:01.659
[Shoupe] Need a wingman in there?

36:02.618 --> 36:04.620
Ah-- I got this.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.706
[radio chatter]

36:09.250 --> 36:11.627
[Lana] <i>I know</i>
<i>I should have said somethin' sooner,</i>

36:13.045 --> 36:15.298
but Scooter said Ward would kill me.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.886
I know it was wrong not to say anything.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.430
You did the right thing in the end.
That's all that matters.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.810
How much did you know?

36:28.603 --> 36:31.480
Ward tipped his hand
usin' me to get that compass.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.358
I figured out the who and the why.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.194
Now I know the how.

36:38.112 --> 36:40.281
You should be careful how you handle this.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.617
Ward's got a lot of friends.

36:48.581 --> 36:49.749
Yeah, I know.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.338
[JJ] We go in there, guns a-blazin',

36:55.421 --> 36:57.298
make Ward Cameron beg for mercy,

36:57.381 --> 37:00.801
abscond with as much gold as possible
and <i>vámonos, </i>get the hell out of there.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.970
-Down the Intracoastal.
-[Kie] Wait for weather.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.263
-Exit to Cuba.
-[JJ] Cuba?

37:04.347 --> 37:07.642
No, man, Xcalak, Jewel of the Yucatan.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.018
Lobsters so thick,

37:09.101 --> 37:12.355
mangoes, and no word for money.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.522
Let's do this shit.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.661
[Sarah sighs]

37:29.163 --> 37:31.707
Dad, I don't understand why
I need to go to the Bahamas.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.918
I think I--
I really need to talk to John B.

37:34.001 --> 37:37.171
No, sweetheart, I told you,
he is not himself right now, all right?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.214
This isn't forever.

37:38.297 --> 37:41.801
It's just until they're able to find him
and get him the help he needs.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.346
-Trust me, all right?
-[sighs]

37:52.478 --> 37:55.523
-[Kie] What's the plan? Broad strokes.
-I don't think we got that far.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.942
They're loading up the gold.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.069
[car horn beeps]

38:01.821 --> 38:02.905
[John B] There's Ward.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.242
I'm worried. You'll need more runway
with that weight.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.035
[Ward] Didn't they cut palms
to extend it?

38:08.119 --> 38:10.997
Yes, sir, but if you're gonna abort,
you're gonna have to do it early.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.457
All that weight's
gonna shorten everything.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.167
I'll be all right.
Thank you. Take the car.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.752
Yes, sir. Safe travels.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.672
-[Ward] Come on! Get this done!
-[man 1] Yes, Mr. Cameron!

38:22.925 --> 38:24.051
[man 2] Yeah...

38:24.927 --> 38:26.095
-What?
-[man 3] Keep comin'.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.013
What?

38:27.096 --> 38:28.806
-[man 4] Keep goin'.
-It's Sarah.

38:29.515 --> 38:30.433
She's with him?

38:30.850 --> 38:32.893
[Ward] Come on, guys.
Let's get this stuff loaded.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.271
Hey! Be careful with that.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.314
What's in the boxes?

38:36.856 --> 38:40.192
Uh, just some, uh...
decorative marble pieces that Rose found

38:40.276 --> 38:42.320
for properties down there.
Antiques, I think.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.071
[man 5] That's it! Close it up.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.532
-Excuse me. Hi. What's in those crates?
-[Ward] Hey. Hey.

38:46.615 --> 38:47.491
[Ward] Yeah, sorry.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.243
-[Sarah] No, excuse me. What?
-Hey. Come on.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.120
-I'm just asking questions.
<i>-</i>I know, it's fine.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.371
-Get on the plane.
-[Sarah] No.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.332
Please get on the plane.
We have to get going.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.667
-No, I changed my mind. I'm going home.
-Sarah. Sarah!

38:56.751 --> 38:58.336
-Excuse me. No! No!
-Do not cause a scene.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.129
-Do not cause a scene.
-No! Stop! Stop!

39:00.212 --> 39:01.881
[screaming] No! No! No!

39:01.964 --> 39:03.924
-[Ward] Go! Get on this plane!
-Wait a minute.

39:04.008 --> 39:07.011
-No! No, I don't wanna go!
-He's hurting her.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.512
-What?
-What?

39:08.596 --> 39:09.680
[John B] They're fighting.

39:09.764 --> 39:10.890
-[Sarah yells]
-Holy shit.

39:11.599 --> 39:12.975
-[Sarah] Ow! [moans]
-[Ward] Get in!

39:13.059 --> 39:14.477
-You listen to me!

39:38.459 --> 39:39.794
What are you doing?

39:40.211 --> 39:41.754

-What are you doing, man?

39:41.837 --> 39:43.130

[laughs]

40:12.576 --> 40:14.161
[Ward] Get off the runway!

40:14.245 --> 40:15.329
Get off!

40:26.382 --> 40:27.341
-No!
-[Ward] No!

40:27.425 --> 40:28.634

-You trying to kill her?

41:11.260 --> 41:12.928
-Trying to get us killed?
-I need the gold!

No! No! No!

41:15.014 --> 41:16.640
No! John B! [sobs]

41:16.724 --> 41:18.809
John B, you're okay. I--

41:18.893 --> 41:20.853
-Get away from him.
-No! Don't touch me!

41:22.229 --> 41:23.898
And don't tell me what to do.

41:24.398 --> 41:26.400
[siren approaching]

41:26.817 --> 41:29.111
-Guys, I can't get arrested.
-I'm on probation.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.280
Look, we're no good if we're all in jail.

41:31.989 --> 41:32.823
[Pope] Come on.

41:36.785 --> 41:38.454
You think this changes anything?

41:39.622 --> 41:40.498
It doesn't.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.127
You gotta get outta here. You gotta--

41:47.046 --> 41:48.714
[Ward] Oh, thank God you're here.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.383
Susan, I told you
he lost his goddamn mind.

41:51.467 --> 41:55.137
-Put your hands on your head.
-[Ward] I'd do what she said.

41:57.097 --> 41:58.474
She's talkin' to you, Ward.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.230
You're under arrest for the murder
of "Big John" Routledge.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.606
-[gasps]
-I got ya.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.690
[Ward] Are you kidding me?

42:06.774 --> 42:08.150
Put your hands on your head.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.736
-[Ward] Are you kidding me, Sue?
-Put your hands on your head!

42:13.364 --> 42:14.448
Turn around.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.706
Drop to your knees!

42:24.833 --> 42:26.752
I don't like bein' used.
