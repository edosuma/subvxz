they put me
on the night shift.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.731
It's really neat, 'cause I get
to work with lots of Japanese
businessmen in busses,

01:08.802 --> 01:11.168

the Lincoln Memorial
glow in the dark.

I think I have really found
my calling this time.

Why the big pow-wow?

(SlGHlNG) I've being
giving this a lot of thought
and I think

01:38.231 --> 01:41.291
the next mission we get
we should get out.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.365
Use the opportunity
to make a run for it.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.265
Interesting proposition.
What do you think, guys?

No, no, I don't know, Face.

01:48.308 --> 01:52.904

if we complete these missions,
then we'll all go free.

FACE: Oh, Murdock,
don't you get it?

01:55.081 --> 01:57.140
We've done everything
that Stockwell has asked,

01:57.217 --> 01:59.151
and he's never so much
as even said thank you.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.119
We even saved the guy's life.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.747
As long as we keep succeeding
at these missions,

02:03.823 --> 02:05.347
he's just gonna keep us
around for more.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.451
And as soon as we fail,
well, we're dead.

our lives.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.232
He's even taken over
my dreams.

to get my pardon, okay?

of Local 1 18 in his hometown
of Lawrence, Long Island.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.085

look like a kidnapping
to keep the cover intact.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.957
Otherwise Tadesco
will just shift his operation

07:39.058 --> 07:40.753

nothing of value.

is going to be at the estate,

09:10.082 --> 09:11.845
which means the security
will be doubled.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.565
Yeah.

you got to get me to a phone.

What smoke device?

a magnificent Rothko.

15:36.035 --> 15:39.493
On the right, you have
a rare Matisse.

You're dead!

Don't let him... Stop him.

Stop him!
You're ruining everything!

You're a dead man!

Sorry, Chief, we have
a road test to complete.

I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

Don't ask why.
Just tell us
what's going on.

tell him it's... Hello?

Lost them.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.935
Tommy is gonna kill
Brick Peterson.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.305
He's the union guy,
right?
Right.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.401
He's the one that took over
from Red Cunningham.

17:26.478 --> 17:30.073
He's the reformer
and he won't play ball
from Tommy, so he's gonna...

17:30.149 --> 17:32.913
Easy, easy.
Take a deep breath,
let it out.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.344

take the contract.

out of there right away.

that big charge

in that oak tree
we are coming to up ahead.

she did five years
at the A.P. overseas.

You said
it was cool.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.242
Remember?
You were on vacation.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.449
You met an interior decorator
from Philadelphia.

a string bikini and goes
combing the beach for me.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.648
Now, nobody hears about this,
you understand? Nobody.

21:06.698 --> 21:07.892
Tell me about it.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.126
It was the A-Team.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.364
We checked the van for prints
and I got a couple of
descriptions from your boys.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.495
A-Team?

21:13.572 --> 21:16.234
Yeah, I put out an APB
and alerted the media.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.798
Now, listen,
I want the satisfaction

21:17.876 --> 21:20.401
of confronting
the girl myself, Brooks.
Face to face.

21:20.479 --> 21:23.573
We handle this
as a kidnapping, Tommy.
Straight police matter.

the best thing you could do
is stay completely out of it.

Forget it, pal,
we're gonna handle it my way.

I'd wanna see is my face
on the nightly news.

made that mistake.

get the hang of it.

on the phone

to remember me by.

he gave you this as a gift.
No, but I want you take that.

two years ago?

talking about, a hit?

the Tadesco estate undercover

pay someone to kill you.

surprise me.

come after me.

out on that stage tonight.

where he's gonna try it.

what I'm saying?

27:28.913 --> 27:29.902

taking that stage tonight.

of your civil rights.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.696
Cease fire!

30:45.877 --> 30:48.175
What the hell's
the matter with you?
I told you not to hurt her.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.214
My boys got
a little rambunctious,
that's all.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.272
Don't play with me, Brooks,
you destroyed that farm.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.250
Hey, they fired
the first shots.

30:54.319 --> 30:57.083
And in case you've forgotten,
these guys
are convicted killers.

30:57.155 --> 31:00.249
Tommy, the Sheriff was
just trying to put this thing
to bed for us, all right?

31:04.929 --> 31:06.123
All right, what do you got?

31:06.197 --> 31:10.258
Switchboard shows they made
a call to the Atlantic City
Convention Center.

31:10.335 --> 31:11.563
Does that mean anything?

31:11.669 --> 31:12.931
That's none
of your business.

31:13.004 --> 31:13.993
Right.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.131
Well, they're definitely
running to the Jersey line.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.004
You got to nail them
before they hit
the interstate.

31:18.076 --> 31:20.772
I've called out
the state troopers and I got
plenty of my own units.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.938
There's only one way
out of here to the interstate.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.983
I plan to set up a gauntlet,
an impassable barrier.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.447
Not bad.

31:28.353 --> 31:31.948
Do you want me to tell them,
"Don't hurt the girl,

31:32.023 --> 31:35.083
"her boyfriend wants
to see her one more time
before he snuffs her"?

31:35.260 --> 31:37.251
You just
crossed the line, pal.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.125
Don't you ever forget
who you're talking to.

31:39.197 --> 31:40.858
I blink and you're history.

31:41.099 --> 31:42.726
Now, I want her alive!

31:44.469 --> 31:45.834
I'll handle it.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.270
Looks like your instincts
were right.

have enemies.

31:55.446 --> 31:57.004
You know what I'm saying?

31:57.949 --> 31:59.814
So that means the convention's
gonna be on the alert.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.409
Now, what if the police
get to Stark
before he delivers?

32:02.487 --> 32:04.546
At these prices,
he won't get caught.

32:08.226 --> 32:09.921
Man, she had me fooled.

32:10.561 --> 32:12.461
I really thought
we had something.

32:12.530 --> 32:15.158
Letting the Sheriff
take care of this
is the best business decision,

32:15.233 --> 32:16.427
you know that.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.361
No argument from me.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.770
I just wanna look her
in the eye first.

is a lunatic.

how you could have
anything to do with him.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.713
Oh, I don't know.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.773
I guess the bottom line
is I just talked
myself into it.

32:33.217 --> 32:35.014
I just kept taking
bigger and bigger risks

32:35.086 --> 32:36.417
on bigger and bigger stories

32:36.487 --> 32:38.819
and this one was gonna be
the biggest story of all.

I don't like it, Hannibal.
It's too quiet.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.686
Yeah, they'll probably
have a roadblock set up

32:45.763 --> 32:47.754

of the county line.

a gallon of gas.

pull in here.

You get the gas.
We'll grab some food.

I'm gonna take off.

now, listen very carefully.

43:49.393 --> 43:53.591
I want you to pan
very slowly back to middle,
until I say hold.

43:54.798 --> 43:55.787
Hold it.

43:58.268 --> 44:00.031
It's the cameraman
on camera two.

44:00.170 --> 44:01.967
TV DlRECTOR:
That's in the balcony.

44:34.938 --> 44:37.065
Pull that trigger
and you're a dead man.

44:37.307 --> 44:38.569
Hey, fool!

44:49.119 --> 44:50.643
Welcome back.

44:54.758 --> 44:56.225
Little has been said
about those

44:56.293 --> 44:58.557
who prevented the tragedy
here in Atlantic City.

44:58.629 --> 45:01.564
But this reporter
experienced those events
firsthand,

45:01.632 --> 45:03.156
moment by moment.

45:03.267 --> 45:07.067
The men who saved
Brick Peterson's life
are real heroes,

45:07.137 --> 45:09.901
brave men
with the ultimate sense
of conviction,

45:09.973 --> 45:12.965
despite the fact
that they have been
misrepresented by the press

45:13.043 --> 45:15.068
and betrayed
by their own government.

45:15.279 --> 45:16.940
The heroes of whom I speak,

45:17.014 --> 45:18.811
are known as the A-Team.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.782
And the conviction
they carry with them

45:20.851 --> 45:24.878
is far more meaningful
than the one handed down
by the military court.

45:25.055 --> 45:28.889
This is Sally Vogel, UBS News,
Atlantic City, New Jersey.

45:30.561 --> 45:34.224
Now, I've been watching
for your reports.
I never saw this on the air.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.457
And I'm sorry to say,
you never will.

45:37.301 --> 45:38.859
I snuck this copy out.

45:39.269 --> 45:42.363
Someone very high up
in the network
killed the story.

45:43.607 --> 45:45.939
Sounds like some favors
had to be repaid.

45:46.710 --> 45:50.510
It's all right.
You don't need to explain.
I just wanted to thank you.

45:50.781 --> 45:52.078
All of you.

45:52.216 --> 45:53.911
It's our pleasure.

45:54.518 --> 45:55.951
Thought you were leaving.

45:56.019 --> 45:58.886
(STAMMERlNG)
Well, small change of plans.

45:58.956 --> 46:00.150
What?
Yeah.

46:00.224 --> 46:03.216
(STUTTERlNG) What, I'm...
I'm sorry. Excuse us,
just for one moment.

46:03.293 --> 46:04.282
Yeah.

46:04.361 --> 46:06.556
Could I have a private
conversation with you?
Oh, sure.

46:06.630 --> 46:09.724
See, I wasn't privy
to this information.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.290
I mean, if you've decided

46:11.368 --> 46:14.599
that you're not
going to leave
then I want my watch back.

46:14.671 --> 46:17.196
Forget it.
It's a gift, Murdock.
You gave it to me. I...

46:17.274 --> 46:20.107
But this is very important
to me. I mean it has
great sentimental value.

46:20.177 --> 46:23.044
Yeah, well, now,
it has great sentimental
value to me, Murdock.

46:23.113 --> 46:25.047
I'll tell you what.
I'll think of you
whenever I wear it.

46:25.115 --> 46:27.640
Look, if you've decided
that you're gonna
keep the watch,

46:27.718 --> 46:29.652
then you gonna
have to go.
Absolutely not!

46:29.720 --> 46:30.744
Go!
No!

46:30.821 --> 46:32.379
Go! Go! Go!
No, I'm...
