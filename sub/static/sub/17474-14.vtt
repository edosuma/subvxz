Ivy told me.

Yeah, so...

01:24.394 --> 01:25.961
Dev and I got into
a huge fight last night,

01:25.995 --> 01:27.062
and he left town
and went to New York,

01:27.096 --> 01:28.731
and he's not texting me.

01:28.765 --> 01:31.699
I can't find my phone.
Can you call Ivy?

01:31.734 --> 01:33.267
She was really drunk
last night,

01:33.301 --> 01:34.736
and she has no room
to make any mistakes at all

01:34.770 --> 01:36.103
after what happened
at <i>heaven on earth.</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:44.111
No, no, no, no,
that's mine.

01:48.416 --> 01:51.918
- Hello?
- Ivy, how are you?

01:51.952 --> 01:54.988
Who... I'm sorry,
who is this?

01:55.022 --> 01:56.556
It's Jessica.
Where are you?

01:56.591 --> 01:58.157
Derek is about
to start notes.

01:58.192 --> 01:59.993
Hi, Jessica.

02:00.027 --> 02:04.764
I'll be there in 30 minutes.
He won't even notice.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.068
I-I'm not going
to tell anybody.

02:09.103 --> 02:13.306
I'm not telling anybody.

02:13.340 --> 02:16.075
Relax, mom, they're lucky
you came back at all.

02:16.110 --> 02:18.577
If you feel uncomfortable,
just call me.

02:18.612 --> 02:20.145
- Julia.
- Hi.

02:20.179 --> 02:23.248
- Welcome to Boston.
- Thanks.

02:23.283 --> 02:25.017
We'll go in with you
if you want.

02:25.051 --> 02:28.053
No, I'm good.

02:40.132 --> 02:43.968
Okay, am I the only one
who enjoyed that?

02:44.002 --> 02:47.838
Yeah, I think maybe you are.
You're gonna be okay?

02:47.872 --> 02:51.707
Once I kill Tom,
I should be fine.

02:51.742 --> 02:56.813
Yeah, I needed
those costumes yesterday.

02:56.847 --> 02:59.950
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

02:59.984 --> 03:02.052
Hi, Julia.

03:02.086 --> 03:04.120
It's nice to see you.

03:04.155 --> 03:07.156
Looking good.

03:09.826 --> 03:11.526
You're here.
You came.

03:11.561 --> 03:15.130
I came, but I'm not
speaking with you.

03:15.165 --> 03:17.466
Yes.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.503
But you came.

03:23.605 --> 03:26.407
You need me?

03:26.442 --> 03:30.078
I just had a few notes
I wanted to go over...

03:30.112 --> 03:32.680
- About that follow light.
- Follow spot.

03:32.714 --> 03:35.716
You're adorable.

03:40.088 --> 03:42.489
So you didn't think
you had enough on your hands.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.825
Ivy, Julia, Michael Swift,
first preview tonight.

03:45.860 --> 03:49.162
I have to make sure Rebecca
has everything she needs.

03:49.197 --> 03:51.664
If this blows up
in any way, Derek,

03:51.699 --> 03:55.102
I'll strangle you.

03:55.136 --> 03:58.705
Here comes Ivy.
How are you?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.508
- Just slept in.
- Nobody noticed.

04:01.542 --> 04:07.013
They haven't started
notes yet either, so...

04:07.047 --> 04:09.716
Where's Derek?

04:09.750 --> 04:13.251
He just
went backstage.

04:13.285 --> 04:15.921
You okay?

04:15.955 --> 04:18.023
Please don't be nice
to me right now.

04:18.057 --> 04:21.091
I mean it, I really will
fall apart if you're nice to me.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.728
Okay, well,
I just hope you know

04:22.762 --> 04:24.530
I had no idea what
was going on with them.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.464
Don't worry, Karen.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.500
It's not your fault,
I know.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.471
Always happens.

04:34.506 --> 04:36.641
You go out of town,
and all hell breaks loose.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.710
- Yeah.
- So true.

04:39.745 --> 04:41.979
I'm not even kidding.

04:42.014 --> 04:45.381
You have to talk
to me eventually.

04:45.416 --> 04:49.719
- I don't, actually.
- Yes, you do.

04:49.754 --> 04:51.588
Tom, it's been
five minutes.

04:51.622 --> 04:52.789
And you're talking
to me already, see?

04:52.823 --> 04:54.290
Okay, all right,
everyone,

04:54.324 --> 04:56.726
listen up, please.
We have a lot to do today.

04:56.761 --> 05:00.262
Now, I don't want anyone
living in a fool's paradise,

05:00.296 --> 05:01.897
but I would say
we're in pretty good shape

05:01.932 --> 05:02.932
for our first preview
tonight.

05:05.035 --> 05:06.802
All right, all right.
Quiet.

05:06.836 --> 05:08.771
You know
I hate enthusiasm.

05:08.805 --> 05:13.075
Very funny.

05:13.109 --> 05:16.243
Hello, my darling.

05:20.549 --> 05:21.783
Okay, we're gonna
bounce around

05:21.817 --> 05:23.484
a little bit
on the notes today,

05:23.518 --> 05:24.852
of which I have
a significant number,

05:24.887 --> 05:26.187
but as you all know,

05:26.221 --> 05:28.255
Michael Swift
rejoined us yesterday

05:28.290 --> 05:30.024
as Mr. DiMaggio.

05:30.059 --> 05:32.358
Thanks.

05:32.393 --> 05:34.427
Now he's gonna have a lot
of catching up to do,

05:34.462 --> 05:36.196
so we'll start
with the DiMaggio numbers

05:36.230 --> 05:39.332
and your favorite and mine,
<i>History is made at night.</i>

05:40.902 --> 05:42.102
All right, people,
let's move please.

05:42.136 --> 05:43.369
We've got
a lot to do

05:43.404 --> 05:44.972
and very little time
to do it in.

05:45.006 --> 05:46.439
No costumes,
just the blocking.

05:46.474 --> 05:49.475
- Thank you.
- Come on, lady.

05:52.178 --> 05:53.545
Hi.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.547
Are you okay?

05:55.582 --> 05:57.883
- Fine.
- You don't seem fine.

05:57.918 --> 06:00.452
Are you sleeping
with Derek?

06:00.487 --> 06:02.121
Excuse me?

06:02.155 --> 06:04.056
I'm sorry,
are you interested in him?

06:04.091 --> 06:06.625
No. It's just,
Ivy's been seeing him,

06:06.659 --> 06:08.227
so I'm surprised.

06:08.261 --> 06:10.695
I didn't know.

06:10.730 --> 06:13.465
Which one's Ivy again?

06:13.500 --> 06:15.700
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

06:15.735 --> 06:18.203
I just didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

06:18.238 --> 06:21.239
Well, then let's get out
of show business then, Karen.

07:05.621 --> 07:06.922
Showtime!

07:06.957 --> 07:08.590
I'm gonna watch
from the mezzanine.

07:08.624 --> 07:10.692
I'll see you at interval.

07:10.726 --> 07:14.262

07:20.235 --> 07:24.538
You came.

07:24.573 --> 07:27.274
That's a nice welcome.

07:27.308 --> 07:30.543
- What happened?
- I had a bit of an altercation.

07:30.578 --> 07:32.545
I don't want
to know, do I?

07:32.580 --> 07:34.714

Why aren't they applauding?
They're not applauding.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.336
First preview,
something big always goes wrong.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.038
- Like no applause?
- Yeah, like that.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.673

- Dev.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.109
See you later, Karen.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.676
Ii thought you went
back to New York.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.211
I've been texting you
all night.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.946
I'm sorry.
I just needed a bit of space.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.382
I was so worried.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.849
I'm sorry, Karen.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.752
No, I'm sorry.
I-I was such a jerk.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.287
- No, no, no, you weren't.
- I was.

15:23.321 --> 15:28.025
I so overreacted.
I trust you, I do.

15:28.059 --> 15:30.861
Ivy. Ivy,
this is my boyfriend, Dev.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.029
You guys have never met.

15:32.063 --> 15:34.965
The famous Dev.
Hi.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.767
Nice to meet you, Ivy.

15:45.274 --> 15:47.843
You can't end a musical
with a suicide.

15:47.878 --> 15:49.845
But that's what she did.
She killed herself.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.980
There's a lot of theories
about what she did.

15:52.014 --> 15:53.414
I thought
you wanted it darker.

15:53.448 --> 15:56.117
I want it to work,
darling, all right?

15:56.151 --> 15:58.853
What if she had a reunion
with her younger self?

15:58.888 --> 16:01.288
What if Norma Jean
came to visit her?

16:01.323 --> 16:02.790
They did that in
the HBO movie, didn't they?

16:02.825 --> 16:04.692
- Ashley Judd.
- You saw that?

16:04.727 --> 16:06.761
I saw everything.
And you know what?

16:06.795 --> 16:08.361
In everything, she dies.

16:08.396 --> 16:11.431
Well, maybe she did,

16:11.465 --> 16:14.134
but <i>Bombshell</i> is
going to run forever,

16:14.168 --> 16:16.670
and every night, that audience
is going to rise to its feet

16:16.704 --> 16:18.271
in a standing ovation.

16:18.305 --> 16:20.306
Now, this is
a three-performance weekend,

16:20.341 --> 16:22.009
and we're gonna need
that new ending

16:22.043 --> 16:26.646
by Monday morning,
and that's all there is to it.

16:32.486 --> 16:34.220
She died!

16:36.257 --> 16:38.024
She's really never been
this mad at me.

16:38.059 --> 16:39.159
You guys are
like a married couple.

16:39.193 --> 16:40.725
You'll work it out.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.294
I'm not so sure.

16:42.328 --> 16:44.229
What are you doing
this weekend?

16:44.264 --> 16:46.698
Writing a song,
I hope.

16:46.732 --> 16:49.401
Come to church with me.

16:49.436 --> 16:52.204
What happens
in church?

16:52.238 --> 16:54.373
People sing and pray.
It's not news, Tom.

16:54.407 --> 16:55.507
I'm Jewish.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.408
Jews sing and pray.

16:57.443 --> 17:01.011
Jews don't sing and pray.
We complain and eat.

17:01.046 --> 17:04.315
Well, complain and eat
with God on Sunday.

17:04.348 --> 17:05.648
Oy.

17:05.684 --> 17:07.417
It's not
just the ending,

17:07.453 --> 17:10.020
although, hello,
it's a problem.

17:10.055 --> 17:13.557
Well, sometimes
Julia likes to take her time.

17:13.590 --> 17:15.492
She's not...

17:15.526 --> 17:17.560
The real problem
is Rebecca.

17:17.595 --> 17:20.363
I think she's pretty good
and appealing as hell.

17:20.397 --> 17:23.031
Yeah, but she's not landing
any of the numbers.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.601
I mean, honestly,
I don't know how

17:24.635 --> 17:25.667
Derek's gonna
get her there.

17:25.703 --> 17:26.903
Are you directing now, Ellis?

17:26.936 --> 17:28.737
I'm producing.
Somebody has to.

17:28.771 --> 17:31.240
Kid,
take a powder.

17:31.274 --> 17:32.575
A what?

17:32.609 --> 17:36.112
I think you need
some rest, Ellis.

17:36.146 --> 17:40.149
Right.
Sorry.

17:45.121 --> 17:49.224
That used to be me, you know,
insane with worry.

17:49.258 --> 17:53.861
- What happened?
- You.

17:53.895 --> 17:56.931
I'm gonna make sure
he has a ride home.

18:11.146 --> 18:13.980
- I love this song.
- Me too.

18:14.015 --> 18:16.215
You know it?...

18:25.259 --> 18:28.093
When I met a young man
courting the girls,

18:28.128 --> 18:31.664
I played me
a waiting game.

18:31.698 --> 18:34.299
I first would refuse him
with tossing curls

18:34.333 --> 18:38.903
and let the old earth
take a couple of whirls

18:38.937 --> 18:42.674
till he plied me with tears
in lieu of pearls.

18:42.708 --> 18:47.312
And as time came around,
he came my way.

18:47.346 --> 18:52.149
As time came around,
he came.

20:33.712 --> 20:35.846
Couldn't take
my eyes off you.

20:35.881 --> 20:38.249
I couldn't take
my eyes off <i>you.</i>

20:38.284 --> 20:40.751
I hadn't even heard
you sing.

20:40.785 --> 20:42.753
I just thought...

20:42.787 --> 20:44.921
We have time.

20:44.955 --> 20:47.957
We could practice
<i>some like it hot.</i>

20:47.992 --> 20:51.094
Don't you have to go
to rehearsal?

20:51.128 --> 20:53.630
- I don't have to be there
till 12:00.

20:53.665 --> 20:55.265
What?

20:58.568 --> 21:02.104
I should
never have come.

21:02.138 --> 21:03.739
You asked me not to.
I'm glad you came.

21:03.774 --> 21:05.941
I told you
last night.

21:05.975 --> 21:08.977
- You asked for more space.
- Yeah, but I...

21:09.012 --> 21:10.546
I got it.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.481
I love you.

21:13.516 --> 21:15.950
And I don't care
about R.J.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.585
I mean, I do,

21:17.620 --> 21:19.554
but it's been so crazy
being up here.

21:19.588 --> 21:22.223
And if she ended up
ruining our relationship,

21:22.257 --> 21:26.628
that would be really just...
Stupid, wouldn't it?

21:28.963 --> 21:30.831
When you left...

21:30.865 --> 21:34.267
It scared me...

21:34.302 --> 21:36.837
So much
that I might lose you.

21:36.871 --> 21:40.474
You won't lose me.

21:40.508 --> 21:44.144
So can we get married?

21:44.178 --> 21:46.479
Is the offer
still on the table?

21:46.513 --> 21:48.514
No "whoa"!

21:48.549 --> 21:53.152
Don't say "whoa" to me.
Go get that ring.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.655
You didn't give it to someone
else already, did you?

21:55.689 --> 21:57.824
I... I left it
in New York.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.460
I didn't think
I was gonna need it again.

22:01.494 --> 22:02.527
Well, you do need it

22:02.562 --> 22:05.230
because you have
to ask me again.

22:13.539 --> 22:16.841
Karen...

22:16.875 --> 22:20.143
Will you marry me?

22:23.482 --> 22:27.184
Yes.

22:27.218 --> 22:31.221
Yes.

22:39.263 --> 22:42.398
Yeah, this'll work.

22:45.369 --> 22:47.003
You're early.

22:47.037 --> 22:49.038
The ensemble's not due in
for a couple of hours.

22:49.072 --> 22:54.310
Sometimes I like
to be early.

22:54.344 --> 22:59.180
So were you just not
going to say goodbye?

22:59.215 --> 23:01.082
Three days ago,
you told me you loved me.

23:01.117 --> 23:03.051
And that was the last time
you spoke to me,

23:03.085 --> 23:05.921
other than
to say "places, please,"

23:05.955 --> 23:07.522
and "stay out of my way",

23:07.556 --> 23:08.856
I'm about to have sex
with a movie star."

23:08.891 --> 23:10.158
Ivy...

23:10.192 --> 23:14.228
Rebecca needs
my attention,

23:14.262 --> 23:17.831
and I'm giving it to her.

23:17.865 --> 23:21.168
Is there
any other approach?

23:21.202 --> 23:22.202
Is that all
this is to you?

23:22.237 --> 23:24.171
We're opening a show,

23:24.205 --> 23:29.608
and you and I
are professionals.

23:29.643 --> 23:31.744
Yeah.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.747
Yeah, we are.

23:34.781 --> 23:38.318
That's why
we do well together.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.762
No one applauded.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.697
No, I'm not
speaking metaphorically.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.599
I'm speaking literally.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.135
I died out there.

23:57.170 --> 24:00.939
I'm alone
in Boston dying.

24:05.344 --> 24:09.280
I, I've got to go.

24:09.314 --> 24:12.383
O-okay.
Yeah.

24:12.417 --> 24:15.219
My shrink.

24:15.253 --> 24:18.288
He takes all my calls.
All of them.

24:18.322 --> 24:20.591
That's how crazy I am.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.126
It wasn't your fault
that they didn't applaud.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.462
I'm the star, Karen.
It's all my fault.

24:25.497 --> 24:26.964
Nobody thinks that.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.399
Everyone thinks it.

24:29.433 --> 24:32.134
And it's true.

24:32.168 --> 24:34.570
If it weren't true,
you'd be Marilyn, wouldn't you?

24:34.605 --> 24:39.008
I don't know.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.443
Sure you do.

24:41.478 --> 24:46.448
There's always someone
coming up the back of you.

24:46.483 --> 24:49.918
Marilyn knew it.

24:49.952 --> 24:51.487
Nearly drove her crazy
in the end.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.422
Look, it was
the first preview.

24:53.456 --> 24:54.756
I mean,
everybody says that

24:54.790 --> 24:56.458
that's what happens
during previews.

24:56.493 --> 24:57.792
I mean, that's what previews
are for, so that...

24:57.827 --> 24:59.628
Things can go wrong.

24:59.662 --> 25:02.531
Rebecca, you okay?

25:02.565 --> 25:05.199
My God, Rebecca?
Can you breathe?

25:05.234 --> 25:07.835
My God, hello?
Somebody help!

25:07.869 --> 25:10.971
I need some...
Call somebody, you guys!

25:16.085 --> 25:19.487
Okay, everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

25:19.522 --> 25:21.356
Okay, obviously we're not going
to be doing the show tonight.

25:21.391 --> 25:23.425
Rebecca's in the hospital,
but she's going to be fine.

25:23.459 --> 25:26.494
The doctors say she had
a severe allergic reaction

25:26.529 --> 25:28.530
to some peanuts,
but she's been sedated.

25:28.564 --> 25:31.498
And apparently,
she'll make a full recovery.

25:31.533 --> 25:34.335
Now we've also decided
to cancel tomorrow's shows.

25:34.369 --> 25:36.703
That's a big decision,

25:36.738 --> 25:39.206
but there's work we need
to do on the ending.

25:39.241 --> 25:43.077
So don't leave town.
No tweeting.

25:43.111 --> 25:48.381
Keep your cell phones on.
This is a moving target.

25:50.651 --> 25:52.352
I'm going to church tomorrow
to say a prayer.

25:52.386 --> 25:53.686
Church?

25:53.720 --> 25:55.521
That sounds really nice.
I'll go.

25:55.556 --> 25:57.457
Maybe I will too.
I could use a little faith.

25:57.491 --> 26:00.126
Me too.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.897
What's going on?
Is she all right?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.899
Do you know
how careful she is?

26:07.934 --> 26:09.401
She would never
accidentally ingest

26:09.436 --> 26:11.437
anything with even
a trace of peanuts in it.

26:11.471 --> 26:13.538
Well, apparently,
something got by her.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.240
No, this was deliberate.

26:15.275 --> 26:17.108
What are you, Miss Marple?

26:17.142 --> 26:19.444
- This is serious.
- I'm sorry.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.813
I understand, but let's just
wait till she feels better,

26:22.848 --> 26:26.284
and find out
what she thinks, really.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.386
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't put it past Ivy.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.554
Karen was there.
Maybe they did it together.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.223
Excuse me?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.058
I'm kidding, Tom.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.061
Look, I'll go to the hospital
when she wakes up, all right?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.963
Well, I'll put in a call
to the local press,

26:39.998 --> 26:41.631
try and keep
a lid on it.

26:41.665 --> 26:44.101
What about New York?
This is gonna be catnip to them.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.236
I'll deal
with them too.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.638
Meanwhile, this thing's
costing us a fortune.

26:48.672 --> 26:50.772
You two need to concentrate
on that new ending.

26:50.807 --> 26:52.674
Let's not waste
any time, all right?

26:52.709 --> 26:54.977
Okay, can we slow
this train down?

26:55.012 --> 26:57.413
What if she
doesn't recover in time?

26:57.447 --> 26:59.982
You know that
you're all thinking it.

27:00.017 --> 27:01.350
What happens to the show?

27:01.385 --> 27:04.153
Karen has had
no time on that stage.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.954
Ivy... knows it.

27:06.989 --> 27:10.191
That's just a fact.
She knows it.

27:10.226 --> 27:12.527
We'll talk about it later.

27:12.561 --> 27:17.432
Go to work
on that song.

27:17.466 --> 27:20.301
I'm thinking.

27:20.336 --> 27:22.302
Rebecca's going
to be fine.

27:22.337 --> 27:23.870
Unless she's not.

27:23.905 --> 27:25.705
Even if she's not,
I'm not the understudy.

27:25.740 --> 27:26.873
But you know it.

27:29.511 --> 27:30.977
I'll see you guys
in a minute.

27:31.012 --> 27:34.648
- Where you going?
- Get more beers.

27:45.225 --> 27:46.359
- Thank you for coming.
- What do you want?

27:46.393 --> 27:47.993
Is this wise?

27:48.028 --> 27:49.662
I think I may have
left something in your room...

27:49.696 --> 27:51.064
A ring.

27:51.098 --> 27:55.333
Well, what kind of ring?

27:55.368 --> 27:56.968
Are you gonna ask her
to marry you?

27:57.002 --> 27:58.803
It's none of your business.

27:58.837 --> 28:01.473
Yeah.

28:01.507 --> 28:03.908
- Yeah, I'll look for it.
- Thank you.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.246
I'll never be ready.

28:08.281 --> 28:11.248
When will they let
you know?

28:11.283 --> 28:15.252
First of all, Rebecca's
probably going to be fine.

28:15.287 --> 28:19.323
And second, Ivy...
Ivy knows it better than I do.

28:19.357 --> 28:20.724
You're the understudy.

28:20.758 --> 28:21.858
No, they don't
rehearse understudies

28:21.893 --> 28:23.327
until after previews.

28:23.361 --> 28:25.228
Aside from that week
when Rebecca was late,

28:25.262 --> 28:29.932
I haven't done it,
and I'm totally unprepared.

28:29.967 --> 28:32.268
Rebecca's probably
coming back.

28:32.303 --> 28:34.937
I want her to come back.
I want her...

28:34.972 --> 28:36.672
To be okay.

28:36.707 --> 28:39.809
I don't know
what I want.

29:16.577 --> 29:17.977
W-we have to talk.

29:18.012 --> 29:19.379
I don't have time.
I have to go,

29:19.413 --> 29:20.580
and I've got
to meet with Tom.

29:20.615 --> 29:21.881
I'm sorry.

29:21.915 --> 29:23.383
I really...
I can't talk to you.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.552
I came here for you.

29:25.586 --> 29:27.387
Michael, we agreed...

29:27.421 --> 29:29.888
I know what we agreed,
and I meant it,

29:29.922 --> 29:31.657
but I knew
when they sent for me,

29:31.691 --> 29:34.926
I-I knew you would never
have done that if you weren't...

29:34.961 --> 29:37.563
A-and you just
keep ignoring me?

29:37.597 --> 29:39.265
Michael, no.

29:39.299 --> 29:42.834
No, no, no, no.
Listen.

29:49.208 --> 29:51.176
I didn't want you here.

29:51.210 --> 29:54.745
I didn't want you here.
I told everyone.

29:54.780 --> 29:57.315
I was ready to walk away
from the show

29:57.349 --> 30:00.318
when I heard
you were doing it.

30:00.352 --> 30:02.586
The only reason I'm here
is because Frank and Leo...

30:07.225 --> 30:13.028
I can't talk to you
about this.

30:13.063 --> 30:14.330
I was right.
I can't even talk to you...

30:14.364 --> 30:19.235
Why not?

31:00.856 --> 31:03.359
I could kill you.

31:05.393 --> 31:06.861
Look, if we put
our minds together,

31:06.895 --> 31:08.295
we can figure it out.

31:08.329 --> 31:10.497
The rest of the show
works beautifully,

31:10.532 --> 31:12.332
Rebecca's fine.

31:12.367 --> 31:15.003
I'm not talking
about the stupid show.

31:17.038 --> 31:19.975
Do you know who
tried to kiss me just now?

31:22.009 --> 31:24.877
Go ahead.
Take a guess.

31:24.911 --> 31:29.215
- He didn't.
- Why?

31:29.249 --> 31:31.784
Why did you let them
steamroll you?

31:31.818 --> 31:35.655
Why did... why did you
agree to this?

31:35.689 --> 31:38.991
They couldn't have
outvoted both of us.

31:39.025 --> 31:41.359
Contractually,
they weren't allowed to.

31:41.394 --> 31:44.329
If we had stuck together,
this couldn't have happened.

31:46.999 --> 31:50.302
Hiring him was
the right thing to do, Julia.

31:50.336 --> 31:52.070
You cannot blame me
for this.

31:52.104 --> 31:54.172
- We needed an actor fast...
- Not this one.

31:54.207 --> 31:58.008
I'm sorry,
but not this one!

31:58.042 --> 32:02.012
You put the show so far ahead
of me and my family,

32:02.046 --> 32:04.848
I may not be able
to save it.

32:04.882 --> 32:08.319
You did that.

32:08.353 --> 32:10.387
I tried to tell you
so many times

32:10.422 --> 32:12.655
not to risk
your amazing family for...

32:12.690 --> 32:15.325
- What?
- I made a mistake.

32:15.359 --> 32:16.926
I made
a terrible mistake.

32:16.960 --> 32:20.162
I am <i>trying</i> to fix it,
and you...

32:20.197 --> 32:21.764
- You cannot blame me for this.
- I am blaming you.

32:21.798 --> 32:23.533
I stood by you.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.602
I didn't condemn you,
and I didn't cut you off

32:25.636 --> 32:27.169
because I love you.

32:27.204 --> 32:30.872
And I tried to be there
for you through all of it.

32:30.906 --> 32:32.608
But I couldn't support you
in this.

32:32.642 --> 32:34.109
I couldn't.

32:34.143 --> 32:36.511
And that is not my fault.

32:36.546 --> 32:38.347
Nothing's ever
your fault, Tom.

32:38.381 --> 32:43.051
It's not, Tom.

32:43.085 --> 32:46.854
You're so righteous.

32:46.888 --> 32:49.022
I love that
about you.

32:49.057 --> 32:51.859
And you're so kind,

32:51.893 --> 32:55.896
and we're such
a team...

32:55.930 --> 32:58.432
Except we're not, are we?

32:58.467 --> 33:01.368
We're not a team.

33:01.402 --> 33:06.406
Because the show is
more important than all of us.

33:18.652 --> 33:22.621
Well

33:22.656 --> 33:26.725
It sounds so weird.

33:28.762 --> 33:31.296
We're not a team.

33:31.330 --> 33:34.832
I'm going back
to the hotel.

33:34.866 --> 33:36.668
I'm going back to see my family.
Julia...

33:36.702 --> 33:37.968
Everyone will
get their song.

33:38.003 --> 33:43.007
The stupid song
will be finished!

33:45.877 --> 33:47.077
It's official.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.579
The lady Duvall
is coming back.

33:49.614 --> 33:51.648
- Where did you hear that?
- It's the company hotline.

33:51.683 --> 33:53.617
- We have a hotline?
- Really?

33:53.651 --> 33:56.186
What does it matter anyway?
You can never find your phone.

33:56.220 --> 33:58.021
- Can I borrow yours?
- My God.

33:58.055 --> 34:00.990
Yes.
Thank you.

34:04.227 --> 34:05.695
Are you okay?

34:05.729 --> 34:07.630
I'm relieved.
Rebecca's great.

34:07.664 --> 34:09.632
She's gonna be great.

34:09.666 --> 34:12.868
I can't get on
that stage with no rehearsal.

34:12.902 --> 34:16.772
- Would have been impossible.
- You'll get your shot.

34:16.806 --> 34:20.708
Though I have more
important things to think about.

34:20.743 --> 34:24.011
Us.

34:29.518 --> 34:32.687
Did you check the hotline?

34:32.722 --> 34:35.688
- Yeah. A vodka soda.
- Two.

34:35.724 --> 34:38.123
And you know what?
Let's do some shots.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.393
- Yes!
- Yes, please.

34:39.427 --> 34:43.697
- Let's.
- Yes, please.

34:54.484 --> 34:55.918
I've known Ivy
for a while, right?

34:55.953 --> 34:57.753
Yeah, Sam and I
go way back.

34:57.788 --> 34:59.289
Great to see you
here too, Tom.

34:59.323 --> 35:01.357
I'm happy
to be here.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.458
You look gorgeous,
Vanessa.

35:02.492 --> 35:04.160
Thank you, baby.

35:04.195 --> 35:06.796
We get to hear you
sing today, Sam.

35:06.831 --> 35:09.365
This has been our church
since Sam was in kindergarten.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.266
- Mom.
- He had a beautiful voice,

35:11.301 --> 35:13.202
- even when he was five years old.
- Mom, mom.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.337
- It's true, it's true.
- Thank you.

35:15.371 --> 35:18.941
Inside.

35:18.975 --> 35:20.709
I have spent more time
with your parents

35:20.743 --> 35:23.178
than I have any boyfriend's
parents in my whole life.

35:23.213 --> 35:24.279
I wouldn't be proud
of that, Tom.

35:24.314 --> 35:26.314
- You made it!
- Barely.

35:26.348 --> 35:28.282
Is it okay to be
hung over in church?

35:28.317 --> 35:30.184
You wouldn't be
the first. Enjoy.

35:30.219 --> 35:31.319
- Morning.
- Morning.

35:31.353 --> 35:32.553
There they go.

35:32.587 --> 35:33.855
This is
my boyfriend, Dev.

35:33.889 --> 35:36.390
- Yeah, hi, Sam.
- Hello.

35:36.424 --> 35:37.391
Hi. Tom.
Nice to meet you.

35:37.425 --> 35:39.695
Nice to meet you too.

35:41.730 --> 35:43.463
Well, say hi, Ivy.

35:43.497 --> 35:46.233
Hi!
Hi, Dev.

35:46.267 --> 35:47.633
Hello, Ivy.

35:47.668 --> 35:48.902
I'm so glad
you organized this.

35:48.936 --> 35:50.237
I love church.

35:50.271 --> 35:52.172
You remember,
I'm gonna make you sing.

35:52.206 --> 35:53.473
Hope that's okay.
She promised.

35:53.507 --> 35:55.041
I think
I can handle that.

35:55.076 --> 35:58.410
- You too, Ivy.
- I'm gonna sit this one out.

35:58.444 --> 36:01.146
Hi, Karen.
Hi, Dev.

36:01.181 --> 36:03.249
- Julia.
- Ivy. Hi, Sam.

36:03.283 --> 36:07.119
So glad you made it.

36:09.089 --> 36:11.690
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi.

36:11.724 --> 36:16.027
We should head in.

36:16.061 --> 36:18.562
Do you know how hard it was
to convince her to come?

36:18.597 --> 36:22.033
Thank you.

36:22.067 --> 36:24.002
Anybody else?

36:24.036 --> 36:25.436
Tell me you didn't
invite Derek.

36:25.470 --> 36:27.038
He's gonna burst
into flames, you know.

36:27.072 --> 36:28.839
Just wait.

36:28.874 --> 36:31.074
And when I go through
my trials and my tribulations,

36:31.109 --> 36:35.445
I still go to church,
and I give him the praise.

36:37.481 --> 36:41.385
And that makes the devil mad.

36:45.323 --> 36:46.855
- So praise him.
- Yes!

36:46.890 --> 36:48.925
Let's stand
with the Lord.

36:50.127 --> 36:52.795
- And say "I..."
- I.

36:52.829 --> 36:54.797
"Believe."
Believe.

Good,
I'll get you comps.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.302
Is Rebecca Duvall
going to be back?

39:57.336 --> 39:59.303
- Actually, she is.
- Wonderful.

39:59.337 --> 40:00.404
All right, mom.
Love you.

40:00.438 --> 40:01.438
- Love you too.
- Sir.

40:01.473 --> 40:03.307
- Bye.
- Pop.

40:03.341 --> 40:06.443
Yeah.

40:06.478 --> 40:08.746
Go talk to her.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.648
You must be
so pleased with yourself.

40:10.682 --> 40:12.817
It's all
God's doing, Tom.

40:12.851 --> 40:17.153
Yeah, I feel pretty smart.
Go.

40:23.527 --> 40:26.429
Maybe Marilyn should
go to church at the end.

40:26.463 --> 40:32.101
Not a bad idea.

40:32.135 --> 40:34.169
I think I've got
a better one.

40:34.203 --> 40:37.405
- You do?
- I think so.

40:37.440 --> 40:41.443
Good.

40:44.380 --> 40:46.914
I'm sorry.

40:46.949 --> 40:50.151
Okay.

40:50.185 --> 40:54.188
Okay.

40:56.291 --> 40:58.292
Here you are.

40:58.326 --> 41:01.029
- Boy.
- That was crazy, right?

41:01.063 --> 41:03.163
Yeah.

41:03.197 --> 41:05.932
You know,
it was gorgeous, actually.

41:05.967 --> 41:07.768
It's always gorgeous
when you sing.

41:07.802 --> 41:09.602
You okay?

41:09.637 --> 41:11.271
There's something
I need to tell you.

41:12.707 --> 41:15.175
Okay.

41:15.209 --> 41:17.510
It's Rebecca.
I have to... I'm sorry.

41:17.545 --> 41:20.046
Hello?

41:20.080 --> 41:24.449
Those peanuts,
they get me every time.

41:24.484 --> 41:26.518
How did this happen?
You're so careful.

41:26.553 --> 41:28.788
I know.

41:28.822 --> 41:30.823
Randall thinks somebody
did it on purpose.

41:30.857 --> 41:32.825
Do you think that?

41:32.859 --> 41:35.493
I do, actually.

41:35.527 --> 41:39.230
It was in the smoothie.
I could taste it.

41:39.264 --> 41:43.168
- Yeah, but I...
- I know.

41:43.202 --> 41:46.905
- I drank it anyway.
- Why?

41:46.939 --> 41:49.373
I was scared.

41:49.408 --> 41:53.643
I've never been
so scared in my life.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.713
I'm not going back
into the show.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.514
What? No,
you have to.

41:57.548 --> 41:58.548
No, I don't.

41:58.583 --> 42:02.352
I so don't.

42:02.386 --> 42:05.055
You're my understudy.
Why aren't you applauding?

42:05.090 --> 42:07.190
Well, I don't know,
I mean, maybe I'm...

42:07.224 --> 42:11.027
I'm not as ambitious
as everybody else apparently is.

42:11.061 --> 42:13.696
Well, maybe
you should be.

42:13.731 --> 42:19.035
Might as well be you.

42:21.271 --> 42:23.338
Okay, so she <i>is</i>
gonna be okay.

42:23.372 --> 42:25.741
She's gonna be fine
in about a week or so.

42:25.775 --> 42:27.575
But she's not coming back
to the show.

42:27.610 --> 42:29.611
- No.
- And it was deliberate?

42:29.645 --> 42:32.447
Well, apparently someone
put peanuts in her smoothie.

42:32.481 --> 42:34.582
- Stop it.
- You're kidding.

42:34.617 --> 42:36.584
Do they have
any idea who did it?

42:36.619 --> 42:39.453
- She doesn't want to know.
- Anyway, it's not the question.

42:39.487 --> 42:43.758
The real question is,
who's going to play Marilyn?

42:43.792 --> 42:46.727
- Poor Rebecca.
- I don't know.
