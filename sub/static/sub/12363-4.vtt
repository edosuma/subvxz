00:45.678 --> 00:49.081
ohh!

00:49.083 --> 00:50.916
Oh, my lord.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.718
Sorry, ruby.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.019
I guess I got a little
overeager with the door.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.687
What's that all about?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.022
Walt got me a job.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.657
Well,
I'd like to stay and chat,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.192
But I've got a delivery
for victoria moretti.

01:01.194 --> 01:05.731
- What? For me?
- Beautiful flowers for a beautiful sunrise.

01:07.167 --> 01:10.102
- Your husband do something bad?
- No.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.670
You do something good?

01:11.672 --> 01:13.739
Shut up. Hey, bob.

01:14.874 --> 01:17.009
- Where's the card?
- Uh, it should be under the ribbon.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.780
It's not here.

01:21.782 --> 01:25.050
Well, maybe he wanted
the flowers to do the talking.

01:25.052 --> 01:28.921
Walt. I got sergeant haynes,
highway patrol.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.290
Hey, charley. What's up?
Is it serious?

01:31.292 --> 01:33.225
Is it serious?

01:35.729 --> 01:37.896
Yeah,
I'd say it's serious.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.242
From the looks
of these skid marks,

01:50.244 --> 01:52.311
Whoever was driving
sure stopped in a hurry.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.746
Any sign of the driver?
No.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.982
I just found the empty rig,
called you right away.

01:56.984 --> 02:00.018
These look like
5.56 caliber.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.888
No blood.
No personal effects, either.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.091
Vic, run the vin number
and call the trucking company.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.060
I want to know where this truck
was coming from,

02:08.062 --> 02:09.862
Where it was going,
and who was driving it.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.630
Branch, come with me.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.939
Someone unhooked a trailer
from this rig,

02:20.941 --> 02:22.241
Attached it to a new one.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.243
You can tell
from these marks.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.844
Hijacking?

02:32.952 --> 02:35.954
Dust these hookup lines
for prints...

02:35.956 --> 02:39.324
The entire cab,
inside and out.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.627
The entire cab?

02:41.629 --> 02:44.296
Yep.
What was hijacked?

02:44.298 --> 02:46.265
Isn't that what you're
supposed to be calling about?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.600
I'm on hold.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.602
Livestock.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.772
Cattle most likely.
Cow patties.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.975
Like cattle rustlers?
That's still a thing?

02:56.977 --> 02:59.678
You can fence cattle
at 100% face value.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.780
Could easily be
$1,000 a head.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.683
If this rig was pulling
a few dozen cattle,

03:04.685 --> 03:05.918
It's good money.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.819
Why not steal the whole truck,
rig and all?

03:07.821 --> 03:10.189
Seems like
it would be a lot easier.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.391
A lot easier to get caught,
too.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.760
Most of these rigs
have built-in gps.

03:14.762 --> 03:18.397
So...If you stole some cattle,
where would you take them?

03:18.399 --> 03:20.766
Slaughterhouse.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.634
All you'd have to do
is doctor the paperwork,

03:22.636 --> 03:23.635
Get paid quick.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.304
Evidence is destroyed.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.306
Yeah, hey...
we just found one of your rigs

03:27.308 --> 03:29.308
Off county road 9...
Branch.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.411
Check the local
slaughterhouses... all of them.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.780
Is that before or after
I dust this whole rig?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.348
You choose.

03:38.151 --> 03:41.853
Sergeant.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.856
We need to search every truck
moving out of the area.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.925
Smart rustlers
will transfer the cattle

03:46.927 --> 03:49.995
To a regular tractor trailer,
cut breathing holes in the roof.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.033
Hey, you were right
about the cows.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.036
Trucking company said the driver
loaded up 42 head of cattle

03:58.038 --> 04:03.141
This morning at the, uh,
triangle arch ranch.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.016
Dale lowry?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.885
I'm not donating to
either candidate, sheriff,

04:13.887 --> 04:15.854
You or the connally kid
running against you.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.422
I'm not looking for votes,
mr. Lowry.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.791
I'm looking for
42 head of cattle.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.928
Any of yours heading to
a.C.A. Processing in dubois?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.330
Yeah, why?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.199
They didn't make it.

04:27.201 --> 04:30.235
Your load got hijacked
out on county road 9.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.738
son of a bitch!

04:32.740 --> 04:35.340
Bill of lading reports
36,421 pounds.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.775
That sound right?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.444
that's what I shipped.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.813
Damn it.
I'm out $50,000.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.050
- That's the second theft we've had
in three years! - Pop, calm down.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.286
Insurance will cover
half of that if I'm lucky.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.857
Wait a minute,
what about cooper?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.492
My driver...
is he all right?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.294
Do you know
this cooper james?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.729
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We go way back.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.765
I always
request him special.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.401
We're searching for him
and your cattle.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.036
We got roadblocks up

05:04.038 --> 05:05.937
And one of my deputies
checking local slaughterhouses,

05:05.939 --> 05:08.440
Make sure the rustler's
not trying to unload them fast.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.209
You heard of any local
cattle auctions coming up?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.779
Wasn't there one today
in worland?

05:13.781 --> 05:17.282
I'm gonna need
a copy of your brand.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.187
I'm gonna need to call
the wyoming livestock bureau.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.890
Protocol is for them to put
a stock detective on the case.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.458
What the hell's
a stock detective,

05:26.460 --> 05:28.093
And why do we need one
anyway?

05:28.095 --> 05:30.429
Well, they're whole job
is catching rustlers.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.799
May have some inside info,
make our lives easier.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.134
Like a cow cop.
Kind of.

05:36.136 --> 05:39.805
I'm going to that cattle auction
in worland. I'll drop you off.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.973
You can, uh... you can drive
to cooper james' place...

05:41.975 --> 05:43.308
...See if his family's
heard from him.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.477
Okay.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.479
Hey, hon.

05:47.481 --> 05:51.049
That was,
um, really sweet.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.384
What was very sweet?

05:52.386 --> 05:54.553
Uh,
the flowers that you sent.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.089
Why would
I send flowers?

05:57.091 --> 06:00.525
Because we're married.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.461
I- I don't mean
I wouldn't send flowers.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.263
But last time I did, you didn't
really like them very much.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.465
Yeah, w...

06:06.467 --> 06:08.233
I don't...
I don't like carnations.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.936
You know, you know that.
But I-I like flowers.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.805
Well, looks like
you have a secret admirer.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.108
No. I don't.
Well, who sent them, vic?

06:20.313 --> 06:22.981
Vic?

06:26.253 --> 06:29.421
Keep it down, boys.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.957
Are you
cooper james' wife?

06:31.959 --> 06:34.192
Yeah. I'm linda.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.361
I'm deputy moretti.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.964
Do you mind
if I come in for a moment?

06:38.966 --> 06:41.299
sure.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.169
Thomas.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.838
Thomas! Thomas.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.474
- Take your brother and go outside.
- Why?

06:49.476 --> 06:52.377
'cause you don't want to piss
off your mother by being rude. Come on.

06:52.379 --> 06:57.349
Go.
Take your guns out.

06:57.351 --> 07:00.352
I'm sorry about that.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.522
Um...
What is this all about?

07:05.893 --> 07:08.160
When's the last time
you spoke to cooper?

07:08.162 --> 07:13.031
Not in the last day.
He's out on a job.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.167
Why?
Was there an accident?

07:15.169 --> 07:17.035
Not exactly.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.105
We found his rig.
It had been abandoned.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.107
What?

07:22.109 --> 07:25.210
W- what happened?
Where is he?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.879
We're looking for him.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.882
And I promise you
that we're gonna do

07:30.884 --> 07:32.350
Whatever we can
to find him.

07:32.352 --> 07:36.054
In the meantime...
It would really help us

07:36.056 --> 07:39.224
If we had
a better picture of him.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.926
Can we borrow that one?

07:40.928 --> 07:44.463
Yeah. Uh...

07:44.465 --> 07:47.165
Of course.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.367
Great. Thank you.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.537
And, uh, if you hear anything
from anyone,

07:52.539 --> 07:55.373
You call me immediately,
okay?

07:55.375 --> 07:56.575
Yeah.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.443
Okay.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.218
Pull any prints
from that truck?

08:06.220 --> 08:08.386
Yeah, but I haven't had a chance
to run anything.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.355
Been too busy
driving all over wyoming

08:10.357 --> 08:12.491
Visiting four different
processing plants.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.493
Already?
That's pretty fast.

08:14.495 --> 08:17.262
I can't drive 55.

08:17.264 --> 08:21.633
Anyhow, no sign
of triangle arch's cattle.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.470
You're up $600. Now $625.
$625 now. $650.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.306
$650. Now $675.
$675. We're at $675.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.276
$675, $675?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.245
There's $675 right there.
Thank you very much.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.479
Now $700.
Looking for $700 on the bid.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.014
$700 on the bid.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.416
Looking for $700?
Looking for $700?

08:40.285 --> 08:42.354
Sheriff?
Uh, you bidding?

08:42.356 --> 08:45.056
Nope. Just browsing.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.125
I need
everybody's livestock papers.

08:50.096 --> 08:54.132
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

08:54.134 --> 08:59.304
That's the last of them.
And nothing.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.473
Hey, sheriff.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.009
Well...
Are we good to go?

09:04.011 --> 09:05.644
Almost.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.646
What's the average auction
weight for that class of steer?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.348
Oh, around 1,100 pounds,
give or take.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.217
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.185
You got
your summons pad?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.187
You writing me
a speeding ticket?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.756
Maybe.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.328
All right.

09:23.330 --> 09:29.668
Dale lowry had 42 head,
weighed 36,421 pounds.

09:29.670 --> 09:35.373
The average weight of each steer
was 867 pounds.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.709
He was selling
underweight cattle.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.578
Yep.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.279
That's bad business.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.348
Let's find out how bad.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.880
Help!

10:17.650 --> 10:20.352
Help me! Please!

10:20.354 --> 10:22.220
Help!

10:27.059 --> 10:29.127
Cooper james?
Yeah.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.529
I've been looking
for you.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.306
Mrs. James.
This is deputy moretti.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.008
I have some great news.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.011
Uh, we found your husband.
yeah.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.780
So, we just need to get
a statement from him,

10:48.782 --> 10:51.216
And then he should be home
in a few hours.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.918
Sheriff.
You have a visitor.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.989
R.J. Watts,
wyoming livestock bureau.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.891
Detective,
thanks for coming by.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.259
I understand
you found the trucker.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.828
It's a good start.
What did he say?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.830
We haven't questioned him yet.
He's in my office.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.999
I thought you'd want to hear
what he had to say firsthand,

11:08.001 --> 11:11.336
So I gave him a few minutes
to eat and collect himself.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.874
So, this rig
tries to pass me.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.210
And I look over, and the guy
in the passenger seat's

11:19.212 --> 11:22.814
Wearing a ski mask,
waving a rifle at me.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.149
Bastards cut me off.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.618
I hit the brakes
as hard as I could.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.753
How many other people
in that rig?

11:28.755 --> 11:33.024
Maybe four of them jumped out,
all wearing masks.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.759
They opened fire.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.394
I thought
they were gonna kill me.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.030
But then,
I'm getting pulled out,

11:39.032 --> 11:40.965
Hands tied, blindfolded.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.333
They mention any place,

11:42.335 --> 11:44.703
Any end location
they might take these cattle?

11:44.705 --> 11:47.872
No. They barely spoke.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.209
Plus, m-my ears were ringing
from the shots.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.178
All I remember, uh...

11:53.180 --> 11:55.747
Is getting tossed in the trailer
with the cattle.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.917
They hooked it up to their rig,
took off,

11:58.919 --> 12:01.352
Then dumped me
in the middle of nowhere.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.992
I just w-want to go home...
See my wife and kids.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.134
That's all
we need tonight.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.903
vic, let's give cooper
a ride home.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.774
My car's
at the trucking company.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.210
That's no problem.
I'll drop you off.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.951
These rustlers
ain't amateurs.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.887
Doesn't appear that way.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.223
I got a bead on a guy...

12:38.225 --> 12:40.458
That... that I bet
is involved with this.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.728
Bobby dunwood.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.964
He's one of the worst rustlers
there is.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.298
By "worst" I mean violent.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.835
So, where is he?
Well, there is that.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.104
He is currently
incarcerated.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.440
He's serving out the end
of a reduced sentence

12:55.442 --> 12:57.742
At the state pen ranch.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.177
He's gonna be out
in a couple of months.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.245
Jail?
Yeah.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.980
That's
a pretty solid alibi.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.984
Walt...There are men running
major criminal enterprises

13:05.986 --> 13:08.987
Outside maximum security.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.156
This place they got dunwood,
it's... it's...

13:11.158 --> 13:13.858
Hell, I've seen
harsher conditions in a motel 6.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.493
It's like
he's at a dude ranch.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.363
You really think

13:18.365 --> 13:20.899
Dunwood carried out
this hijacking from jail?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.934
You got multiple guys.
You got masks.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.469
You got
high-powered weapons.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.006
I- it's bobby's
modus operandi.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.075
Sounds like
we should talk to him.

13:34.748 --> 13:38.082
I heard this place
was low-security.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.118
I had no idea how low.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.986
Yeah. No fences.
No guard towers.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.521
Every inmate works.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.190
Gives them purpose
and job training

13:45.192 --> 13:46.457
For when
they're released.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.226
Plus, wyoming gets
nearly free labor.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.761
Wins all around.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.262
Lucky wyoming.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.599
Dunwood. Dunwood!

13:57.236 --> 14:00.939
There's no need
to yell!

14:04.244 --> 14:06.244
R.J. Send you?

14:06.246 --> 14:09.781
Someone hijacked a truck
in my county, 42 head...

14:09.783 --> 14:11.449
Sounds a lot like you.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.184
Right.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.886
But I'm in here.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.188
So, I fail to see
how I'd be involved.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.024
But I appreciate
the flattery.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.559
Easy enough
to plan and issue orders

14:21.561 --> 14:23.261
When you have
this kind of freedom.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.896
Sure.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.031
But somebody would have
had to have visited me, right?

14:27.033 --> 14:30.902
Check the visitors logs.
I ain't seen no one.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.239
Well, then...Any thoughts on
who might have pulled it off?

14:34.241 --> 14:37.041
I can't help you
with that one.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.210
Only that it wasn't me.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.046
And I wouldn't believe
everything you hear, sheriff,

14:42.048 --> 14:44.949
Especially when it comes from
the mouth of r.J. Watts.

14:44.951 --> 14:48.586
Well, it's natural to say that
about a man who put you away.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.322
Why don't you tell little r.J.
It's time to retire?

14:51.324 --> 14:54.025
'cause I'm starting
with a clean slate.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.461
I already got two legit offers
for ranch work

14:56.463 --> 14:57.962
When I get out of here.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.365
I'm gonna buy me
my own ranch someday.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.373
I look forward
to seeing that.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.619
Vic. You all right?

15:29.996 --> 15:31.562
hello?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.865
omar. It's vic.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.500
Did you send me flowers?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.870
Well, uh...I don't know.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.872
Did you receive flowers?

15:40.874 --> 15:43.942
You got another suitor
besides me, vicky?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.177
Vic?
Walt needs you.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.182
Vic, I checked
the visitors log.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.251
Dunwood hasn't had
any visitors of note.

15:53.253 --> 15:57.155
Maybe he had a go-between.
True.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.157
I need you to check
the whole visitor log.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.359
I also got
a list of recent parolees.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.361
We need to find out
where they ended up.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.330
One of them
may be working with dunwood.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.467
Vic, you there?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.469
Guys.
Vic?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.738
Guys!

16:24.084 --> 16:26.951
if this thing kicks me...

16:26.953 --> 16:29.454
Triangle arch.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.456
It's dale lowry's brand.

16:31.458 --> 16:35.460
One down.
Only 41 to go.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.329
Maybe this isn't
cattle rustling at all.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.199
Could be some kind of
political statement.

16:41.201 --> 16:45.069
"my farts caused
hurricane sandy."

16:45.071 --> 16:47.238
That was
cooper james' wife.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.374
He didn't come home
last night.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.378
Coop came in here
to file an incident report.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.381
It's right here.
Took him 20 minutes.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.083
I know. I saw him go in there.
What happened?

16:59.085 --> 17:01.419
Well, he left. I thought
someone was picking him up.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.021
But his car is over there.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.530
Where the hell
could he have gone?

17:38.490 --> 17:41.993
okay.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.162
I got him.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.666
So, you got my message.
yep.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.102
Can't say
as I saw this coming.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.605
What am I gonna
tell his wife?

17:54.607 --> 17:56.507
I said we got him back.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.110
This isn't your fault,
vic.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.312
I drop a witness off,
and before they can get home,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.514
These bastards come,
and they hang him in a trailer?

18:03.516 --> 18:07.285
Cooper wasn't a witness.
He was in on this.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.454
Partners turned on him.

18:09.456 --> 18:13.157
One less guy
to divide the pie with.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.493
What makes you so sure?

18:15.495 --> 18:18.229
He didn't smell
like manure.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.065
- I noticed when we cut him down.
- Spend a couple hours

18:21.067 --> 18:22.767
Bouncing around the back
of a truck full of steer,

18:22.769 --> 18:24.335
You're gonna
smell like cow shit.

18:25.704 --> 18:28.072
Desperate men
do desperate things.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.475
It leads to this.

18:32.277 --> 18:36.147
If the hijackers killed him
to keep more of the take,

18:36.149 --> 18:38.216
Why let a cow go
in town square?

18:38.218 --> 18:40.218
It's throwing away
money.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.586
It's a misdirect.

18:42.588 --> 18:45.289
They want us running in circles
trying to figure out

18:45.291 --> 18:47.625
Who hung a stupid sign
on a heifer's neck.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.728
Meanwhile, they bolt off
to colorado or kansas,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.096
And they sell
the rest of their haul.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.432
You're still
thinking dunwood?

18:54.434 --> 18:57.068
Dunwood folds
into this somehow.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.103
He's killed before.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.239
You're not gonna find that
on his rap sheet, but he did.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.807
Why is that?

19:02.809 --> 19:05.810
Because a couple of years
before he went to jail,

19:05.812 --> 19:09.614
I had a guy in dunwood's crew,
my own snitch.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.315
Well, dunwood must have
found out about it

19:11.317 --> 19:12.917
Because I found my guy,
too.

19:14.419 --> 19:15.753
And his hands
were bound behind him,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.221
And he was
hanging from the rafter

19:17.223 --> 19:19.090
Of a truck-stop bathroom.

19:19.092 --> 19:22.326
That sound familiar?

19:23.595 --> 19:25.730
So, then,
how do we get dunwood?

19:25.732 --> 19:28.733
Well, there's one thing
we can try.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.602
We release him
on furlough.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.138
We keep an eye on dunwood.
We follow him.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.107
I bet you he'll lead us

19:36.109 --> 19:38.342
Right to the guys
who helped him pull this off.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.512
I'll think about it.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.681
Right now,
I got to notify cooper's wife.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.284
No. I'll tell her.

20:01.433 --> 20:06.137
Mrs. James, I'm sorry to
tell you that we found cooper.

20:06.139 --> 20:08.873
And he's gone.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.510
He was found...

20:31.630 --> 20:33.898
mrs. Jame...

20:33.900 --> 20:36.901
Don't you touch me!

20:36.903 --> 20:38.669
You lied.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.340
Saying everything was okay,
that... oh, god.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.383
My oldest son found that
three hours ago

20:52.385 --> 20:53.451
On my front doorstep.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.829
He was like family.

21:04.831 --> 21:08.466
Are you sure
cooper was involved?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.501
Looks that way.

21:10.503 --> 21:14.238
well, I am at a loss.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.940
Looked into
your insurance.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.310
You tripled your theft coverage
since last year.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.045
Why?

21:24.716 --> 21:28.252
Well, when you've
been robbed before,

21:28.254 --> 21:29.787
It's a normal thing
to do.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.691
Dale, have you been
struggling financially?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.726
What, just 'cause
I upped my insurance?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.695
Sheriff,
that's called being prudent.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.399
Is it prudent
to sell underweight cattle?

21:41.401 --> 21:43.901
Why not let them graze
and fatten up all summer, then sell them?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.237
Sounds like
you needed money.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.738
I did need money,
sheriff.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.640
That's why
people sell things.

21:50.942 --> 21:52.443
See, I spent too much
on feed last fall.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.878
I got overextended.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.414
I took it in the balls in '07
like everyone else.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.748
I got a son
and a daughter,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.284
Both in fancy,
east-coast colleges

22:00.286 --> 22:02.320
Costing me
80 grand a year.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.822
Here's how things look
from where I'm sitting.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.691
You got financial trouble.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.859
You tripled
your theft insurance.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.896
You hired a trusted driver
to do whatever you asked.

22:11.898 --> 22:15.433
I didn't
steal my own cattle!

22:15.435 --> 22:17.835
And I sure as hell
didn't kill cooper james.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.837
And you want to talk
more about it,

22:19.839 --> 22:23.841
You can call my lawyer!

22:32.484 --> 22:33.818
Look what showed up
on cooper james' doorstep

22:33.820 --> 22:35.986
This morning,
according to his wife.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.792
It's $10,000.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.795
If you're gonna kill cooper
to cut him out of the deal,

22:44.797 --> 22:48.299
Why give his wife
a duffel bag full of cash?

22:48.301 --> 22:50.835
We got more cattle
heading up main street.

22:50.837 --> 22:54.705
The question in durant these
days is, "where's the beef?"

22:54.707 --> 22:56.874
And the answer is,
"everywhere you turn."

22:59.912 --> 23:00.945
Excuse me, ladies.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.480
What do you think

23:02.482 --> 23:04.648
About everything
that's going on here today?

23:04.650 --> 23:06.851
Anyone?
Uh, yeah.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.552
I support
whoever did this.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.888
The beef industry
is destroying our planet.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.423
They cut down rain forests,

23:12.425 --> 23:14.425
Overbreed in
inhumane conditions.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.726
Meat is murder.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.428
Thank you, miss.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.996
Young lady!

23:18.998 --> 23:21.899
This is wyoming.
This is beef country.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.034
Now, I respect
your right to free speech,

23:24.036 --> 23:25.703
But not your stupidity.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.571
100 years from now,

23:27.573 --> 23:30.040
People will look back on you
as a barbarian.

23:30.042 --> 23:33.344
Darling, why do you think
god gave us these?

23:33.346 --> 23:35.980
They're
called bicuspids.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.549
They're for tearing meat,
not tofu.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.619
People like you
are destroying this planet!

23:41.621 --> 23:42.920
Hey! It's people like you
that are killing...

23:42.922 --> 23:44.455
Get out of here, omar!
Enough!

23:44.457 --> 23:46.690
Show's over.
Everybody go home.

23:46.692 --> 23:49.460
You. Don't let that guy
get under your skin, okay?

23:49.462 --> 23:52.797
You're this close to being
arrested for disorderly conduct.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.665
He could file assault charges
against you

23:54.667 --> 23:55.966
If he really wanted to.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.001
Go.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.702
Omar,
what are you doing?

23:58.704 --> 24:00.704
I was just
minding my own business,

24:00.706 --> 24:02.506
Delivering
somebody flowers,

24:02.508 --> 24:05.676
When this ecoterrorist came up,
started talking garbage.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.012
These better not be
for vic.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.148
Oh, come on, walt.
It's all in good fun.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.951
Didn't this kind of harmless fun
cost you your first wife?

24:15.821 --> 24:17.988
All right, I'll ease up.
No.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.624
Don't ease up.
Just stop. Okay?

24:20.626 --> 24:25.496
I'm gonna go have me
a burger!

24:33.405 --> 24:35.906
This isn't
just about cows.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.075
I'm looking for
a man named jordan helms.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.911
Now, the feds say
he moves around a lot

24:40.913 --> 24:42.112
But might be holed up
on the res.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.114
First of all,
jordan helms is

24:44.116 --> 24:47.518
Just an activist
who posts lectures on youtube.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.019
And he is not holed up.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.055
He's a brit who's shacked up
with his cheyenne girlfriend.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.923
Supposedly,
helms has connections

24:52.925 --> 24:54.992
To the e.L.F.,
earth liberation front.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.695
Supposedly, they sabotaged
a fracking operation

24:57.697 --> 24:59.530
In cumberland county
last month.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.198
Same deal
with the eco signs.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.602
Maybe mr. Helms has raised
his activism to a new level.

25:04.604 --> 25:08.005
let me see what I can do.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.544
Pardon me for not stopping.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.813
This machine
has a small dynamo...

25:15.815 --> 25:18.516
That creates
electric power.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.951
I've almost generated
our day's needs.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.653
Mr. Helms,
I'm investigating

25:22.655 --> 25:24.855
The hijacking
of a truck full of cattle.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.558
Cattle are showing up
with signs attacking big beef.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.761
Shadow said
she saw it on the news.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.062
I don't watch.

25:32.064 --> 25:35.599
Look at this, then.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.671
I don't know
anything about it.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.774
that said,

25:43.776 --> 25:46.577
I wholeheartedly
support whoever did.

25:46.579 --> 25:47.811
And civil disobedience

25:47.813 --> 25:49.947
Is a powerful weapon
to enact change.

25:49.949 --> 25:53.918
I've seen what arrogant actions
can do to an empire.

25:53.920 --> 25:58.789
The cheyenne people,
they respect the earth.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.958
She needs our support.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.827
Am I right, brother?

26:03.829 --> 26:07.531
I suppose...Brother.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.800
You reach a lot of people
with your videos.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.836
My deputy tells me you have
50,000 followers on facebook.

26:12.838 --> 26:15.105
This is a war.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.509
I'm fighting for the planet.
It can get ugly.

26:18.511 --> 26:21.679
Yeah, real ugly.
Like murdering ugly.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.582
I thought you said it was
a cattle-truck hijacking.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.517
The man driving the truck
was killed.

26:26.519 --> 26:30.187
Look...
I want to be clear.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.289
I could not
and would not ever support

26:32.291 --> 26:34.358
Any action
that results in violence.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.695
I had nothing to do
with this.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.197
Unless posting those speeches
on the internet

26:40.199 --> 26:42.733
Inspired
some unhinged people.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.102
Then you had a hell of a lot
to do with it.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.806
This is america,
where people are supposed to

26:48.808 --> 26:52.343
Take responsibility
for their own actions.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.949
- Hello?
- Moretti. Is the sheriff with you?

26:58.951 --> 27:02.953
Yeah, hang on a second.
Walt.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.555
Heya, walt.

27:04.557 --> 27:07.124
Did "johnny greenpeace"
confess?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.626
Nope.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.961
Yeah,
I didn't think so.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.964
I had the d.A. Draw up papers
for dunwood to be furloughed.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.233
Excuse he's gonna be given
is budget cuts.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.002
Final step,
I need you to sign off, walt.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.970
Hey, pull over here.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.978
Did you, uh, find out
where dunwood's prison buddies

27:27.980 --> 27:30.014
Went to work
after their release?

27:30.016 --> 27:32.716
I got my deputy
working on that.

27:32.718 --> 27:35.285
She's preoccupied
at the moment.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.655
R.J., send the furlough papers
to the station.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.657
I'll sign them.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.329
Stop messing with me!
Hey! Hey!

27:45.331 --> 27:47.598
- How do you not remember?
- I don't remember.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.266
- Take a breath. Take a breath.
- That's bullshit! Where's the card?

27:49.268 --> 27:51.368
- Where's the card?
- Okay, I may... I may have lost it.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.037
- What's going on?
- This job is a lot of responsibility.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.204
I'm just trying to
learn the ropes here.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.073
oh, my god.
I'm sorry!

27:56.075 --> 27:58.609
Bob,
retrace your steps.

27:58.611 --> 28:00.611
Find the card
that went with those flowers.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.252
Find that card, bob.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.130
ooh.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.633
Okay. Okay.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.301
You know,
I've put 16 guys behind bars

28:24.303 --> 28:25.803
In the last 10 years.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.639
Every single one of them
are out.

28:28.641 --> 28:31.175
Most of them
went back rustling.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.944
What was his name?
Who?

28:33.946 --> 28:37.014
Your informant... the one
you said that dunwood hanged.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.718
Davy wilson.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.721
He was a good guy.
He didn't deserve that.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.389
You do what we do,

28:45.391 --> 28:48.926
The people you work with
become like family.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.929
My dad did this, you know?
Oh, yeah.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.931
Yeah,
he was the real deal.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.800
He was a tom horn
sort of stock detective.

28:56.802 --> 28:59.737
You didn't tussle with him
and get off easy.

28:59.739 --> 29:03.741
Old bastard died
in the line of duty.

29:03.743 --> 29:08.445
Drove his truck off the road
chasing a stolen haul.

29:08.447 --> 29:13.050
I guess I'd do the same
if I had to.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.385
People think
cattle rustling's a joke.

29:15.387 --> 29:18.756
Well, it ain't a joke.
It ruins lives.

29:18.758 --> 29:22.192
My dad...Davy.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.130
besides, I don't know

29:26.132 --> 29:28.031
What the hell else I'd do
besides this.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.366
What about you?

29:29.368 --> 29:31.435
If I don't get re-elected
next month,

29:31.437 --> 29:33.170
I'll have an answer
for you.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.773
Well, if I was a resident,
I would vote longmire.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.842
Have you ever considered
relocating?

29:38.844 --> 29:40.744
no.
Hell, I'm too old to move.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.414
Oh.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.950
Yeah. Watts here.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.385
Yeah, yeah, he's here.
Hang on.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.154
Hey, vic. You okay?

29:50.156 --> 29:51.955
Yeah.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.957
I'm fine.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.828
So, uh...Branch is still
going through the visitors log,

29:57.830 --> 29:59.830
But I found out
that in the last six months,

29:59.832 --> 30:02.166
13 inmates have been released
from state pen ranch.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.168
And all of them
have ranch jobs,

30:04.170 --> 30:06.503
But one guy
named whitey culver

30:06.505 --> 30:08.405
Works at
the triangle arch ranch.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.407
Good work, vic.
Right.

30:10.409 --> 30:14.478
I heard her.
Her...Voice really cuts through.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.814
So, it looks like we've got
our connection to dunwood.

30:16.816 --> 30:20.117
You stay tight on him. I'm gonna
go talk to this cowhand.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.424
Dale.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.793
I don't see a lawyer there
with you, sheriff.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.862
Look, I'm just
trying to figure this out.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.864
Now,
I'll ask a question.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.499
You don't want to answer it,
that's your call.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.068
You got a hand
named whitey culver?

30:38.070 --> 30:40.904
Yeah. He's working now.
Why?

30:40.906 --> 30:42.406
Were you aware
that whitey served some time

30:42.408 --> 30:44.107
At the state pen ranch?

30:44.109 --> 30:46.376
He got locked up for
a bar fight that went too far,

30:46.378 --> 30:47.911
Not for rustling.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.247
Whitey served with
a guy named bobby dunwood,

30:50.249 --> 30:52.950
One of the biggest rustlers
in wyoming.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.985
So, I'm gonna need to
talk to whitey.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.987
He lied to me.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.889
He told me
he never met a one.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.390
Well, it's true what they say,
isn't it?

31:00.392 --> 31:03.360
No good deed goes unpunished,
does it, son?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.963
I'll go get him.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.471
Sugarloaf...
that's in maine, right?

31:14.473 --> 31:15.973
Yeah.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.307
You go to college
up there?

31:17.309 --> 31:18.542
Yep,
one more year to go.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.110
Here he is, walt.

31:21.346 --> 31:24.047
Talk to the man.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.849
Is there a problem,
sheriff?

31:25.851 --> 31:27.985
You know bobby dunwood,
don't you?

31:27.987 --> 31:30.354
No.

31:31.489 --> 31:34.858
A l-little bit.
But I...

31:34.860 --> 31:37.361
Ah, whitey.
You're fired.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.996
Dale, hang on a sec.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.599
You been in touch with dunwood
since you were released?

31:42.601 --> 31:44.468
Hell no.

31:44.470 --> 31:48.505
Mr. Lowry, haven't I always
done a good job for you here?

31:48.507 --> 31:51.875
You know, I had good intentions
hiring you.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.177
But now I can't
afford to trust you.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.048
Whitey.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.518
The truth
is all I'm looking for.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.453
I didn't steal no cattle,
sheriff.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.322
Trent.
Yes, sir?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.891
Will you come pick up your cows?
I got no space.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.259
Today good?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.894
Sure thing, sheriff.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.896
Okay.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.365
Come on, whitey.

32:15.367 --> 32:18.235
Can't vicky
take my complaint?

32:18.237 --> 32:20.237
No.
Branch will be back soon.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.106
Oh, come on, walt.
Do I have to do this?

32:23.108 --> 32:25.976
Got no issues
with that granola girl.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.978
I like pushy women.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.313
Just do
what I ask you to do.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.948
Walt.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.116
Trent lowry's here
for the cows.

32:33.118 --> 32:37.020
Uh, I just need you to sign
some paperwork in my office.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.289
After you.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.997
Amy?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.598
Hey. You're here.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.601
They're trying to charge me
for bumping some old, crazy guy.

32:51.603 --> 32:52.970
You two know each other?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.639
I guess you met at college
in maine.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.341
Freeport college, is it?

32:57.343 --> 32:59.609
I noticed your t-shirt
this morning in the town square.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.111
I assume
you two are dating.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.180
Yeah.
Is that against the law?

33:03.182 --> 33:05.048
Depends on what you do
on your date.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.984
I just got one question
for you, trent.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.586
Are you okay with whitey culver
getting fired

33:09.588 --> 33:11.321
For a crime
he had nothing to do with?

33:11.323 --> 33:12.923
I don't know that he had
nothing to do with it.

33:12.925 --> 33:15.559
Yeah, you do.
You both do.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.294
Men rustle cattle
to make money.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.629
They're not interested in
advancing a political agenda.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.164
<i>But you are.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:26.703
Amy, are you familiar with
a man named jordan helms?

33:26.705 --> 33:29.573
Yeah.
So are a lot of people.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.275
He has a very impressive
facebook page, lots of friends.

33:32.277 --> 33:37.547
They leave comments like, uh,
"big beef destroys the planet.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.516
It's time to stop talking
and start acting."

33:39.518 --> 33:41.251
You recognize that?

33:42.487 --> 33:44.588
It's got your picture
and your name next to it,

33:44.590 --> 33:48.525
Along with another
46 comments by you.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.660
It's not against the law
to express an opinion, is it?

33:50.662 --> 33:53.296
No. But it sure gives you
a motive.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.566
And he's opportunity...
son of a rancher.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.101
Look, sheriff...
isn't it your job

33:58.103 --> 33:59.603
To find criminals
who deserve punishment?

33:59.605 --> 34:01.972
So, why not arrest
the board of b.P.?

34:01.974 --> 34:03.507
Their greed and negligence
resulted in

34:03.509 --> 34:08.210
172 million gallons of crude oil
being spilled into the gulf.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.547
They're
the real criminals.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.083
What are you doing?

34:13.085 --> 34:16.219
What is this?
What are you doing?

34:19.190 --> 34:20.389
You can't do this.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.658
Actually, I can.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.460
When you murder someone,
you go to jail.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.629
Cooper james, the trucker
hauling those cattle,

34:25.630 --> 34:29.266
He was murdered,
hung by the neck.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.301
You scared now?

34:31.303 --> 34:34.304
Wait.
We never hurt anyone.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.339
Those cows
were never really stolen.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.108
We're releasing
all of them.

34:38.110 --> 34:41.645
It was just a hoax...
to raise awareness.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.179
We paid cooper $10,000

34:43.181 --> 34:45.514
To shoot up that rig
and switch trailers.

34:45.516 --> 34:48.284
That's all.
That's a crime.

34:48.286 --> 34:52.289
Cooper needed that money
for his family. All right?

34:52.291 --> 34:54.791
This was supposed to help
everybody get what they wanted.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.326
Nobody was
supposed to die.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.028
<i>Why would
we kill cooper?</i>

34:58.030 --> 35:01.231
You two take a moment
and talk amongst yourselves.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.100
Good luck.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.102
So,
you think they did it?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.438
Well,
they stole the cattle,

35:08.440 --> 35:11.041
But I don't think
they killed cooper james.

35:11.043 --> 35:12.609
Well, who else
would want cooper dead?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.644
They're the only ones who knew
he was involved in this.

35:16.814 --> 35:20.684
No. They weren't.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.063
Yeah. Watts here.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.731
R.J.
Oh, hey, walt.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.734
Hey, you talk to that cowhand
over at triangle arch yet?

35:37.736 --> 35:40.103
He's clean,
but we made an arrest.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.439
Turns out the rustlers
weren't really rustlers at all.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.773
Dale lowry's son, trent,

35:43.775 --> 35:46.076
He did something stupid
for a girl he loves.

35:46.078 --> 35:47.110
We have a confession.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.612
Well, h-hold on, walt.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.481
You... you think a college kid
killed that trucker,

35:51.483 --> 35:53.483
Strung him up like that?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.085
Tell you what,
let me talk to him.

35:55.087 --> 35:56.620
You over at the station?

35:56.622 --> 35:59.623
Nope. I'm driving out
to the state pen ranch.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.159
What are you
doing that for?

36:02.161 --> 36:03.827
Dunwood has nothing
to do with this case.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.529
It's time
to end his furlough.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.864
Pick him up and meet me
back at the state pen ranch.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.399
Yeah, s-sure, walt.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.468
Um...
I'll see you over there.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.313
There he goes.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.881
So, what now?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.883
We wait.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.756
Bob barnes found the card
that went with your flowers.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.525
He dropped it off.

36:42.134 --> 36:44.267
R.J.?
What are you doing here?

36:47.672 --> 36:49.573
Who's it from?

36:54.178 --> 36:55.845
Come on, vic.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.883
After all this, you're not
gonna tell me what it says?

37:02.421 --> 37:05.889
It says
"happy anniversary."

37:05.891 --> 37:09.292
I thought your anniversary
was in October.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.861
It is.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.733
But did you see
that girl?

37:16.735 --> 37:18.802
come on, man!

37:18.804 --> 37:20.670
You got to be
kidding me.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.906
oh, yeah.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.308
I seen
this truck before.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.677
Aw, you're...
come on, man!

37:52.604 --> 37:54.304
State pen ranch
is the other way.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.039
Yep.

37:58.242 --> 38:00.577
This about the hooker?

38:00.579 --> 38:02.912
'cause I didn't know she was one
till she asked for the cash.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.317
Yeah. Watts here.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.652
R.J.
Oh, hey, walt.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.820
Dunwood with you?
Yeah, I got him.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.522
We're heading back
to state pen ranch.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.659
See you in about...
10, 15.

38:15.661 --> 38:16.993
No, you won't.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.362
You got your own plans
for dunwood,

38:19.364 --> 38:21.798
Same as you had
for cooper james.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.501
What are you talking about,
walt? I...

38:24.503 --> 38:27.771
Look, j-just stay tight,
and... and I'll see you soon.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.839
I'm bringing dunwood in.

38:29.841 --> 38:33.977
Then why are you driving
in the wrong direction?

38:33.979 --> 38:37.447
Why you following me?

38:37.449 --> 38:40.950
Why are you heading
out of town, r.J.?

38:40.952 --> 38:43.820
'cause I'm going home.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.422
Not with bobby dunwood.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.258
There's not gonna be
any more hangings, r.J.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.559
Look...
That thing with cooper...

38:49.561 --> 38:51.795
I didn't mean for that
to happen.

38:51.797 --> 38:57.033
Yeah, I followed your deputy
and him back to the truck depot.

38:57.035 --> 39:00.537
But...
H- he didn't smell like cattle.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.405
I just noticed it
a little quicker than you did.

39:02.407 --> 39:05.442
And when I pressed him on it,
he kept lying.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.944
And I hate a liar.
Can't stand one.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.646
I knew damn well
he stole them.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.315
He did.
But not for dunwood.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.684
He was working with
the rancher's son.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.019
I told you
I got nothing to do with this.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.355
Now pull the truck over
and let me out!

39:18.357 --> 39:22.525
There's a connection, walt.
You just ain't found it yet.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.894
This piece of trash
has ruined enough lives.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.429
And I'll be damned

39:26.431 --> 39:28.498
If I'm gonna give him
another slap on the wrist

39:28.500 --> 39:29.966
And let them
unleash him again

39:29.968 --> 39:31.768
To go back out
and start stealing,

39:31.770 --> 39:34.471
Ruin more lives,
take more lives.

39:34.473 --> 39:39.976
No. No, that ends,
and that ends now.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.887
R.J.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.690
R.J.,
I can't let you leave absaroka.

39:57.661 --> 39:59.763
Now, there's an honorable way
to end this.

39:59.765 --> 40:04.501
How's that, walt?

40:04.503 --> 40:07.670
All them sons of bitches
I sent away...

40:07.672 --> 40:12.008
Not a single one of them
is still behind bars.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.779
Now they gonna
put me in jail.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.581
So, where's the honor?

40:18.583 --> 40:22.919
Detective...

40:22.921 --> 40:26.055
Think about
what you're doing.

40:31.562 --> 40:34.431
Sheriff, I have.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.932
I have.

40:41.138 --> 40:43.039
you got your seatbelt on?

40:43.041 --> 40:45.375
No.

40:45.377 --> 40:47.043
Good.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.381
What are you doing?!

40:51.383 --> 40:53.016
Hey!

40:54.485 --> 40:56.853
R.J.!

41:43.935 --> 41:46.936
Aw, you're awake.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.005
I wanted
to surprise you.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.541
- What's the occasion?
- Doesn't have to be an occasion.

41:54.713 --> 41:57.580
You hurt your finger?
Love hurts, babe.

41:57.582 --> 42:00.116
Plus, I got competition from
that secret admirer of yours.

42:00.118 --> 42:03.052
So I got to go big.

42:10.662 --> 42:13.630
What is it?

42:17.568 --> 42:20.303
They found me.
