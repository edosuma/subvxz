02:14.281 --> 02:15.401
Hello?

03:17.102 --> 03:18.142
Ah...

04:23.622 --> 04:25.182
Hello?

04:27.742 --> 04:28.742
Hello.

04:57.342 --> 04:58.822
Can you help me?

05:00.702 --> 05:03.302
Do you know who I am? I... I...

05:05.262 --> 05:08.182
I can't remember who I am.

05:26.502 --> 05:28.141
Hello?

05:28.142 --> 05:30.221
Do you know who I am?

05:30.222 --> 05:31.661
Please!

05:31.662 --> 05:33.302
I can't remember.

06:13.022 --> 06:14.622
Lady, help me!

06:16.222 --> 06:17.581
Help me!

06:17.582 --> 06:18.782
Help me, please.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.221
Oh! Help!

06:34.222 --> 06:36.702
Help me. He's got a gun! Help me!

06:38.502 --> 06:40.901
Hey! We have to go!

06:40.902 --> 06:43.821
Come on!

06:43.822 --> 06:45.222
Oh, my god! Help!

06:47.582 --> 06:49.141
Oh, my god!

06:49.142 --> 06:51.141
Stay back!

06:51.142 --> 06:52.582
Back! Get back!

06:55.622 --> 06:57.262
Get back. Back!

07:00.862 --> 07:02.022
Let me in. Let me in!

07:02.023 --> 07:03.982
Help me! Help me!

07:10.982 --> 07:11.982
Shit!

07:17.622 --> 07:19.182
There's a door round there.

07:19.183 --> 07:20.261
It's locked.

07:20.262 --> 07:21.260
You don't know that!

07:21.261 --> 07:22.342
There's a keypad.

07:22.343 --> 07:24.021
We should try it.

07:24.022 --> 07:26.662
Get down! Anybody stands up,
they'll shoot their heads off.

07:26.663 --> 07:30.141
He's trying to kill me!
What's going on?

07:30.142 --> 07:32.100
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

07:32.101 --> 07:33.462
He can see you. Get back.

07:35.982 --> 07:39.421
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with those people?!

07:39.422 --> 07:41.940
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

07:41.941 --> 07:43.302
Where the fuck have you been?

07:43.303 --> 07:44.581
What?

07:44.582 --> 07:46.662
Get that extinguisher.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.021
I can't! I can't do it!

07:50.022 --> 07:51.621
Get it. Get it now!

07:51.622 --> 07:54.181
OK... OK... OK...
OK... OK...

07:54.182 --> 07:55.542
Come on.

07:57.222 --> 07:58.782
Quickly. Slide it to me.

08:01.062 --> 08:03.862
Damien, if he climbs through, you
grab him and you grab his gun.

08:03.863 --> 08:04.861
I can't...

08:04.862 --> 08:05.621
You can.

08:05.622 --> 08:06.781
He'll shoot me!

08:06.782 --> 08:08.141
You have to!

08:08.142 --> 08:11.460
I'm going to smash the lock off that
door, you help him with gun guy.

08:11.461 --> 08:14.420
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

08:14.421 --> 08:16.222
We either rush him or run, OK?

08:16.223 --> 08:17.381
I can't do this!

08:17.382 --> 08:19.341
We have no choice!

08:19.342 --> 08:20.342
Help him.

08:21.782 --> 08:23.381
Urgh!

08:23.382 --> 08:24.741
Damien!

08:24.742 --> 08:25.942
Oh, my...

08:27.422 --> 08:28.702
Get him!

08:47.502 --> 08:48.502
Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

09:03.022 --> 09:04.341
Get down.

09:04.342 --> 09:05.582
Shh!

09:09.022 --> 09:10.342
Fuck!

09:17.702 --> 09:19.662
Shh!

09:48.662 --> 09:49.662
No.

09:52.062 --> 09:54.222
We have to go, come on.

09:56.342 --> 09:57.382
Shit.

09:58.982 --> 10:00.062
Stay down.

10:02.142 --> 10:03.422
Shit.

10:05.582 --> 10:06.862
Stay down.

10:13.342 --> 10:15.980
Who are they?
Why do they look like that?

10:15.981 --> 10:17.662
They like scaring people.

10:17.663 --> 10:18.662
What?

10:19.982 --> 10:23.421
OK. We have to run for that opening.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.061
No, they'll see us.

10:25.062 --> 10:27.342
If they're busy with him
we can lose the hunters, OK?

10:27.343 --> 10:28.621
No.

10:28.622 --> 10:29.982
You just stay with me. OK?

10:29.983 --> 10:30.981
OK.

10:30.982 --> 10:32.262
Ready... Come on...

10:37.568 --> 10:38.648
Wait.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.208
Wait!

10:51.745 --> 10:54.543
The onlookers sometimes wait
in the windows, keeping lookout.

10:54.544 --> 10:58.343
I'm pretty sure that's how they find
us. Through the cameras somehow.

10:58.344 --> 11:01.303
Onlookers spot you and a few minutes
later the scary bastards turn up.

11:01.385 --> 11:02.984
This is mad, this is just mad.

11:02.985 --> 11:05.706
Hold it together and do
what I say or you'll get us killed.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.945
I...

11:07.946 --> 11:11.624
I woke up in this house and I don't
even know if it's my house.

11:11.625 --> 11:13.426
I don't even know who I am.

11:13.427 --> 11:15.105
You must know something.

11:15.106 --> 11:16.665
Ah!

11:16.666 --> 11:18.865
I think this is my daughter.

11:19.249 --> 11:20.648
But you don't know?

11:20.649 --> 11:22.729
She could be anywhere.

11:24.169 --> 11:27.409
Maybe you tried to kill yourself.
Would that explain it?

11:27.410 --> 11:28.688
There was pills.

11:28.689 --> 11:29.968
I don't blame you.

11:29.969 --> 11:32.487
Lots have tried that fun
fork in the road since it started.

11:32.488 --> 11:33.649
Since what started?

11:35.049 --> 11:36.768
You really don't know?

11:36.769 --> 11:38.248
No.

11:38.249 --> 11:41.007
There was a signal... Like pictures,
flashing pictures.

11:41.008 --> 11:43.209
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

11:43.210 --> 11:45.008
anything with a screen.

11:45.009 --> 11:47.208
Argh!

11:47.209 --> 11:49.528
Ugh!

11:49.529 --> 11:51.369
I saw it. I saw it.

11:54.529 --> 11:55.769
Get down.

11:58.529 --> 12:00.528
They did something to people.

12:00.529 --> 12:03.647
Like, almost everybody just became
onlookers,

12:03.648 --> 12:05.527
started watching, filming stuff,

12:05.528 --> 12:08.487
like spectators who don't give a
shit about what happens.

12:08.488 --> 12:10.509
That's, like, nine
out of ten people now.

12:10.573 --> 12:11.931
But not us.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.970
Some of us weren't affected.
I don't know why.

12:13.971 --> 12:16.330
Like that man with the gun
and that woman.

12:16.331 --> 12:19.370
I call them "hunters". You might've
noticed that's what they do.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.330
They seemed normal, but they
realised

12:21.331 --> 12:22.930
they could do what they wanted

12:22.931 --> 12:26.370
and they started taking stuff,
nicking cars cos they could,

12:26.371 --> 12:29.490
doing what they like and not just
with things, with people.

12:29.491 --> 12:32.810
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

12:32.811 --> 12:35.212
So this... This thing on the TV,
the...

12:35.213 --> 12:36.411
The signal.

12:36.412 --> 12:38.850
That's what's making them act like
this?

12:38.851 --> 12:41.050
I guess they were always like that
underneath.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.810
Just needed the rules to change,
for no-one to intervene.

12:43.811 --> 12:46.212
What we going to do?
What we going to do?

12:46.213 --> 12:48.291
Do? Do nothing. We get out.

12:48.292 --> 12:50.211
Where's "out"?

12:50.212 --> 12:52.930
We're here.
We need to head south of here.

12:52.931 --> 12:55.292
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's OK there.

12:55.293 --> 12:57.731
The TV transmitters, they carry it.

12:57.732 --> 12:59.010
There's only one between us

12:59.011 --> 13:01.812
and the safe zone and we're going to
knock it out. See, it's here.

13:01.813 --> 13:02.932
White Bear.

13:05.892 --> 13:07.731
What?

13:07.732 --> 13:08.892
White Bear...

13:13.932 --> 13:16.171
Uh! Ungh!

13:16.172 --> 13:20.852
A picnic with my
two best friends.

13:27.052 --> 13:28.530
Jesus, what is it with you?

13:28.531 --> 13:30.412
White Bear, you said White Bear...

13:30.413 --> 13:31.612
So?!

13:32.852 --> 13:36.612
Look, whatever's wrong with you,
you have to keep it together. OK?

13:36.613 --> 13:39.411
Listen to me! Don't go out there.

13:39.412 --> 13:40.652
What's your problem?

13:40.653 --> 13:44.091
Huh? You want something to look at?

13:44.092 --> 13:46.092
Cos I'll give you something
to look at!

13:46.093 --> 13:47.892
No, I want to talk to him.

13:49.252 --> 13:51.331
I want to talk to you!

13:51.332 --> 13:52.611
Ah!

13:52.612 --> 13:54.892
It's not so funny now, is it?

13:59.332 --> 14:00.332
Put it down.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.132
I just want to see what
they're looking at.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.891
I said put it down.

14:05.892 --> 14:08.770
It's dangerous.
Their phones, they're dangerous.

14:08.771 --> 14:11.412
It's the signal. The images are
on them, they're on the screen.

14:11.413 --> 14:12.891
What?

14:12.892 --> 14:14.891
Don't look at it!

14:14.892 --> 14:15.892
Don't look at it.

14:23.452 --> 14:25.892
'Jemima...'

14:29.852 --> 14:32.890
No, no. This is all wrong.
This is all wrong!

14:32.891 --> 14:34.412
They're coming. Run! Run!

14:44.972 --> 14:46.451
Get in.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.852
Get in. Come on.

14:50.652 --> 14:51.852
Come on.

14:53.012 --> 14:56.571
Come on, now! They're coming!
Quick.

14:56.572 --> 14:58.852
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

15:10.892 --> 15:12.410
You nearly killed us back there.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.332
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting you
to be there, was I?

15:15.333 --> 15:19.731
I just saved your lives.
A wee 'thank you' would be nice.

15:19.732 --> 15:22.011
I should've just run yous over.

15:22.012 --> 15:23.451
Who are you?

15:23.452 --> 15:25.531
Who are you?

15:25.532 --> 15:27.772
It's not a hard question, is it?

15:31.452 --> 15:33.531
I know... I know you.

15:33.532 --> 15:37.052
Do you? Well, where did we meet,
if you know me?

15:40.812 --> 15:42.570
No. Didn't think so, yeah.

15:42.571 --> 15:43.892
She's not in a good way.

15:43.893 --> 15:45.572
Yeah, I'll say.

15:46.932 --> 15:49.532
So what are yous doing out here
anyway?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.291
Heading south.

15:51.292 --> 15:53.610
That's not a good move.
It's all blocked up down there.

15:53.611 --> 15:55.050
There's a transmitter there...

15:55.051 --> 15:56.610
I don't think you understand.

15:56.611 --> 15:58.612
When I said, "It's not a good move",

15:58.613 --> 16:02.531
that means I'm not driving
you down there.

16:02.532 --> 16:04.731
I know a safe place we can go.

16:04.732 --> 16:06.411
The woods.

16:06.412 --> 16:08.370
Your safe place is in the woods.

16:08.371 --> 16:09.492
How'd you know that?

16:11.852 --> 16:13.531
I don't... I don't know.

16:13.532 --> 16:15.332
Christ, maybe you do know me.

16:16.972 --> 16:19.971
Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

16:19.972 --> 16:21.852
We talk. There's no-one chasing us.

16:21.853 --> 16:23.051
Mystic Meg.

16:23.052 --> 16:24.332
And then what happens?

16:26.532 --> 16:27.532
We eat.

16:39.092 --> 16:41.371
Told you. No bars.

16:41.372 --> 16:42.972
They'll never find us here.

16:45.932 --> 16:48.411
That your daughter?

16:48.412 --> 16:50.051
Yeah, I think so.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.771
Where is she?

16:51.772 --> 16:53.131
I don't know.

16:53.132 --> 16:54.492
What'd you do to your wrists?

16:54.493 --> 16:55.931
Don't know.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.852
History of mental illness?

16:59.572 --> 17:02.131
Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

17:02.132 --> 17:03.771
What about you?

17:03.772 --> 17:04.891
What about me?

17:04.892 --> 17:06.771
Mental illness, weaknesses...

17:08.252 --> 17:09.690
Everyone's got weaknesses.

17:09.691 --> 17:12.490
Yeah, you two have got more
that most, I'd say.

17:12.491 --> 17:16.412
That's why you're on the receiving
end, you see. Vulnerable.

17:16.413 --> 17:18.531
Receiving end of what?

17:18.531 --> 17:22.971
This. Everything that's going on.
Easy pickings.

17:22.972 --> 17:24.931
What's your weaknesses then?

17:24.932 --> 17:26.330
My weaknesses?

17:26.332 --> 17:29.132
Show you if you want.
You want to see it?

17:30.172 --> 17:32.932
Wait there don't move.
You're going to like this.

17:32.933 --> 17:35.131
Not a lot.

17:35.132 --> 17:36.930
This better not be naturism.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.132
Yeah, in your dreams.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.211
Tada!

17:41.212 --> 17:43.132
Run and I'll shoot you in the back.

17:45.892 --> 17:47.651
Right, come over here.

17:47.652 --> 17:48.692
Stand there.

17:54.052 --> 17:56.491
You, here, put this on.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.892
Put it on. Backwards,
so it covers your eyes.

18:08.012 --> 18:11.170
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.

18:11.171 --> 18:13.052
You're her eyes now, all right?

18:14.212 --> 18:16.771
And that is a shotgun, OK?

18:16.772 --> 18:19.930
If I pull this trigger, it's going
to cut you, both in half.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.732
So no funny business, all right?

18:21.733 --> 18:23.211
Right, off you go.

18:23.212 --> 18:26.452
Straight ahead.
Keep going through the trees.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.731
Come on, pick up the pace.

18:31.732 --> 18:34.610
Got a lovely
playground for you down there.

18:34.611 --> 18:36.052
That's it, through here.

18:38.692 --> 18:40.252
That's it, straight ahead.

18:46.372 --> 18:47.412
Grab her!

18:50.652 --> 18:52.772
Right, now take her balaclava off.

19:20.972 --> 19:22.172
Get down there.

19:28.372 --> 19:30.532
Oh, fuck.

19:32.932 --> 19:33.852
Come on.

19:35.332 --> 19:36.892
Head towards that ladder.

19:40.612 --> 19:43.051
Get down there.

19:43.052 --> 19:46.692
Right, stop. Get on your knees, both
of you. Give me that bag.

19:46.693 --> 19:48.731
Fucking bag.

19:48.732 --> 19:50.132
You, get down.

19:51.452 --> 19:52.612
Stop whingeing.

19:53.892 --> 19:55.012
Stop fucking crying.

19:56.052 --> 19:58.131
Stop it. Eurgh!

19:58.688 --> 19:59.888
Yeah.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.126
I'm down in that wood spot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

20:04.127 --> 20:06.366
I'll just lash them to a tree or
something like that.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.506
Just hurry up and get down here.
I want to get started.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.562
It's going to piss... Fuck!

20:17.064 --> 20:20.704
Your mate's fucked off. You're in
double trouble now, missus.

20:20.705 --> 20:23.183
Get up on that log. Now! move!

20:23.184 --> 20:26.104
Get your hands through there.
Get your hands through there!

20:26.105 --> 20:27.823
Right through.

20:27.824 --> 20:31.463
Push your arms up. Push them!

20:31.464 --> 20:32.984
Get them up there!

20:34.664 --> 20:39.823
Are we going to put a show on for
these guys today, eh?

20:40.432 --> 20:41.472
Eh?

20:43.775 --> 20:48.454
Let's see what Daddy's got in the
bag, shall we? Oh...

20:48.455 --> 20:52.614
Oh! Oh, mama.

20:52.615 --> 20:55.094
Help me! Help me!

20:55.095 --> 20:57.414
Please, just help me!

20:57.415 --> 20:59.574
Why are you doing this to me?

20:59.575 --> 21:02.095
Whoa-ha! Oh yeah!

21:03.215 --> 21:06.814
Help me, please. I'm a human being!

21:06.815 --> 21:09.533
They're not going to help you.
They're going to watch.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.213
What I'm going to do here darling,

21:11.214 --> 21:13.575
is just going to push this
straight through your...

21:13.576 --> 21:16.855
Help me!

21:37.255 --> 21:40.634
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you!

21:40.692 --> 21:42.411
For what?

21:42.412 --> 21:44.251
For coming back for me.

21:44.252 --> 21:45.532
I came back for this.

21:52.332 --> 21:54.332
There's more like him on the way.

22:01.412 --> 22:02.652
Come on.

22:47.791 --> 22:49.149
Whitebear's not far from here.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.869
If we step on it we might be able
to shut it down before they get us.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.815
- What happens if we can't shut it down?
- We can.

22:53.816 --> 22:55.494
How? Do we hack into it,
or something?

22:55.561 --> 22:57.880
We don't hack anything.
We burn the control room down.

22:57.881 --> 23:00.722
It's not hard, we just slosh a load
of petrol round, strike a light

23:00.723 --> 23:03.401
and fucks the electrics
or something.

23:03.402 --> 23:05.001
Here.

23:05.002 --> 23:06.322
In the bag.

23:07.362 --> 23:09.922
It's the plans
for the transmitter compound.

23:12.242 --> 23:14.482
I've been planning this, you know.

23:20.882 --> 23:23.041
Jemima?

23:23.042 --> 23:25.361
Lie down for me, darling. Go on.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.121
It's a game.

23:27.122 --> 23:29.242
Yeah, just like what Teddy does.

23:31.402 --> 23:32.882
Lie down for me, darling.

23:37.122 --> 23:37.842
Turn around!

23:37.843 --> 23:38.881
What?

23:38.882 --> 23:41.960
White Bear, there's something not
right about White Bear. I remember!

23:41.961 --> 23:45.202
You "remembered" the woods, too.
Sorry if I don't trust your hunches.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.442
OK. Looks clear.

24:06.202 --> 24:07.682
OK.

24:19.002 --> 24:21.882
He was good for something,
after all.

24:43.722 --> 24:46.321
Hurry up, we need to go!

24:46.322 --> 24:49.242
Come on... Get out...

24:50.802 --> 24:52.442
Come with me...

24:59.762 --> 25:03.362
A picnic with my two best friends.

25:06.642 --> 25:07.882
Come on.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.122
This way.

25:16.762 --> 25:19.920
Oh, shit. They'll be here
any minute. Give me the plan.

25:19.921 --> 25:21.880
The transmitter tower's over there

25:21.881 --> 25:24.642
and the cabling runs
underground into that building.

25:24.643 --> 25:26.242
Come on!

25:36.042 --> 25:38.002
Thought so.

25:44.522 --> 25:45.642
Let's go!

27:03.562 --> 27:05.682
Get back.

27:06.962 --> 27:09.562
Or everything goes up.
I mean it... Stay back.

27:13.242 --> 27:14.482
Stay back.

28:24.675 --> 28:27.035
Wh, wh, wha, what...?

28:30.195 --> 28:32.835
Thank you.

28:36.075 --> 28:39.794
So. I guess you're wondering
why you're here?

28:39.853 --> 28:42.453
Well,
it's time to tell you who you are.

28:50.576 --> 28:52.456
You've looked better.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.305
Do you recognise him?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.984
Uh... Yeah.

29:01.985 --> 29:04.864
Your fiance, lain Rannoch.

29:04.865 --> 29:07.345
Or, should I say, was your fiance.

29:12.785 --> 29:17.065
In case you haven't guessed,
the pair of you aren't very popular.

29:17.066 --> 29:20.064
But I'll tell you what you are
though.

29:20.065 --> 29:21.424
You're famous.

29:21.425 --> 29:24.105
'The trial of Victoria Skillane

Crocodile tears are making me sick!

Murderer!

31:15.505 --> 31:16.905
Murderer!

31:19.065 --> 31:22.145
There were no tears
when you watched him do what he did.

31:22.146 --> 31:25.824
You filmed what he did.
A poor wee girl.

31:25.825 --> 31:30.745
Helpless and terrified
and you just watched.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.825
How do you like it now?

31:38.585 --> 31:39.945
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?!

31:41.825 --> 31:43.425

No! No! Please...

32:15.265 --> 32:17.425
NO! Please!

32:23.025 --> 32:25.745
Good evening, citizens!

32:27.145 --> 32:31.304
Thank you so much
for coming tonight. OK!

32:31.305 --> 32:33.744
We're at the climax of our day.

32:33.745 --> 32:36.785
Take as many photographs as you
want, take as many photographs

32:36.786 --> 32:40.824
as you can, but most importantly,
what I need from you

32:40.825 --> 32:44.705
is to shout and scream and let that
bitch know that youse are out here.

32:46.945 --> 32:49.665
Let's get this show on the road!

32:57.705 --> 32:59.785
Murdering bitch!

33:01.745 --> 33:03.545
Evil witch!

33:05.345 --> 33:08.024
Dirty whore!

33:08.025 --> 33:09.985
Burn the bitch!

Kill me. Please just kill me.

35:23.265 --> 35:25.464
Please...

35:25.465 --> 35:27.025
That's what you always say.

35:36.145 --> 35:37.824
♪ Doo-ba-doo-ba-do... ♪

35:37.825 --> 35:40.703
You've had a bad day,
but this will wipe it clean.

35:40.704 --> 35:42.145
Get you in the mood to start again.

35:42.146 --> 35:46.944
No! Please! Get off me!
What are you doing?

35:46.945 --> 35:48.545
Takes about 30 minutes...

35:52.265 --> 35:55.624
for it to fully
do the business.

35:55.625 --> 35:56.705
So while it does...

36:00.385 --> 36:02.745
Why don't we watch
some in-flight entertainment?

36:02.746 --> 36:04.465
Please, no.

36:07.905 --> 36:10.224
'Healthy stuff, like apples'.

36:10.225 --> 36:12.264
Please stop.

36:12.265 --> 36:14.984
You should enjoy this.

36:14.985 --> 36:16.344
You shot it.

36:16.345 --> 36:20.825
'Made it together,
so that my two friends...'

36:25.825 --> 36:30.105
'Erm... A picnic for me
and my two best friends.'

36:58.665 --> 37:00.665
Help me.

37:52.625 --> 37:55.023
'OK everyone, we're about to head
into the park

37:55.024 --> 37:56.625
so I'll hand you over to Baxter.'

38:03.985 --> 38:05.144
Thank you.

38:05.145 --> 38:08.103
All of our roles are very,
very important, yours included.

38:08.104 --> 38:10.025
Now, yours come
with some basic rules.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.784
Rule number one, no talking,

38:12.785 --> 38:16.543
not just to her, but each other
as well, unless it's essential.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.865
We're trying to get her to believe
that youse are all mesmerised.

38:20.905 --> 38:23.745
I know, I know, I know,
but she's believed it up to now.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.024
Morning, ticket please.
Thank you.

38:29.025 --> 38:32.264
'OK, rule number two,
keep your distance.'

38:32.265 --> 38:34.943
I can't stress the importance
of this one enough, OK?

38:34.944 --> 38:37.425
Don't forget,
she's a dangerous individual.

38:37.426 --> 38:40.584
Imagine that she's an escaped lion.

38:40.585 --> 38:43.383
Now yesterday, she threw
a projectile, and we will step in

38:43.384 --> 38:46.263
if she gets too close.
We're all equipped with tasers,

38:46.264 --> 38:48.943
but then we're into story shutdown
and we've all wasted a day.

38:48.944 --> 38:51.545
So it's best to keep your distance
at least three metres back.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.545
You can use your camera zoom.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.504
'Last, but not least,
enjoy yourself'.

38:58.505 --> 39:01.303
That's probably the most
important rule of all, OK?

39:01.304 --> 39:04.463
Take photographs, run around through
the woods, but try and stay safe.

39:04.464 --> 39:06.905
We'll be keeping an eye on you,
making sure you're all OK.

39:06.906 --> 39:08.144
So get out there,

39:08.145 --> 39:11.785
enjoy yourselves and let's make
this show happen, people! Come on!

39:23.865 --> 39:25.985
Ow!

39:46.665 --> 39:48.025
Look, there she is.

39:53.945 --> 39:56.425
'Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.'

39:56.426 --> 39:58.424
Me, too.

39:58.425 --> 40:01.345
'She's just leaving her house now.
Two minutes tops.'

40:01.346 --> 40:04.025
Right, you are. We're on.

40:31.625 --> 40:32.625
Watch out!

40:34.745 --> 40:37.943
He's trying to fucking kill me.
What's going on?

40:37.944 --> 40:39.425
'Get that extinguisher.'

40:41.865 --> 40:43.185
It's OK, they've gone.

40:44.945 --> 40:46.545
Convincing, eh?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.625
We got two minutes.

41:04.025 --> 41:05.745
Help!

41:10.545 --> 41:12.305
Help me!

41:24.585 --> 41:26.064
'Early screamer.'

41:26.065 --> 41:32.145
It's an early screamer tonight.
So keep the noise up and let's go!

41:51.441 --> 41:52.441
Ow!
