Twinkle Little Star" )

00:49.083 --> 00:52.251
Mr. Candle said
I'm gonna be a musician.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.087
Sweet. I got
champion swimmer.

00:55.089 --> 00:58.257
I was gonna get dressed,
but now I don't need to.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.727
Wow. Everyone's getting
really awesome careers.

01:01.729 --> 01:05.030
I can't wait to find out
what my future holds.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.099
( nervous laughter )

01:07.101 --> 01:10.602
MAN: Star Butterfly.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.772
- Please sit.
- Okay.

01:15.341 --> 01:16.775
Help yourself
to some candy.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.044
No, thank you.

01:19.046 --> 01:24.383
I'm just really excited
to have my fortune told.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.118
How do you do it?
Read palms?

01:26.120 --> 01:29.254
Converse with the dead?
Examine head lumps?

01:29.256 --> 01:32.891
Nope. Just normal
guidance counselor stuff.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.427
Have you given much thought
to your future?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.229
Totally.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.132
When I grow up,
I wanna raise warnicorns.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.733
( whinnying )

01:41.735 --> 01:43.969
Well, that seems like
a fun hobby.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.305
But you might not
have much time for hobbies

01:46.307 --> 01:47.739
as the queen of Mewni.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.675
Queen?

01:51.744 --> 01:53.745
I may not know
your fortune,

01:53.747 --> 01:57.316
but your future
is set in stone.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.451
Stone?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.420
Are you dating anyone?

02:01.422 --> 02:03.255
What? Uh, no.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.790
What about that Marco boy?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.758
Got a secret crush on him?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.427
He's my roommate.
We're just friends.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.496
Yeah, that's weird
to date your roommate.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.798
Maybe someone else then.
It's never too early to start

02:12.800 --> 02:14.833
searching for the future
king of Mewni.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.101
Maybe.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.237
Cheer up, Star.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.672
Or should I say
Your Majesty.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.674
Hmm.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.912
So how'd it go?

02:26.914 --> 02:30.249
Or we can catch up later.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.417
Mr. Diaz.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.520
I've been very anxious
to speak to you.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.755
Seen my test scores,
have you?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.423
Indeed.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.459
Garbage Island?!

02:40.461 --> 02:42.594
What's the use of taking
honors classes

02:42.596 --> 02:44.863
if it gets you sent
to the middle of nowhere?

02:44.865 --> 02:47.833
So don't go.
At least you have a choice.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.102
Apparently, the only
thing in my future

02:50.104 --> 02:52.304
is being queen.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.873
Oh, man, I'd love
to be queen.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.643
You never have to
think about what to wear.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.311
You have somebody
do that for you.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.779
( groans )

03:00.781 --> 03:02.814
People would just love you
because they have to,

03:02.816 --> 03:04.683
no matter how weird
you are.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.717
( groans )

03:05.719 --> 03:07.553
You never have
to bathe alone.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.421
Marco, please stop
talking.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.894
Head janitor,
Garbage Island.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.729
( sighs )

03:20.066 --> 03:21.233
( plopping sound )

03:21.235 --> 03:23.035
I'll come back later.

03:31.911 --> 03:34.146
All right, sir,
phase one is complete.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.480
What's next?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.982
Sir, are you there?

03:36.984 --> 03:39.718
You idiot!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.987
You forgot
the most important part. Me!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.989
I got confirmation.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.758
- Starco is
completely platonic.
- MARCO: Starco?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.328
Make sure there's
no possibility of them

03:49.330 --> 03:50.896
ever being a thing.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.764
Absolutely, sir.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.067
Also, stop offering
everyone candy.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.169
You're gonna blow
my cover.

03:57.171 --> 03:58.870
I want her back.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.906
- I gotta go.
- I'm not done.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.508
No. You don't understand.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.845
- I gotta go.
- Flush me first!

04:06.847 --> 04:09.414
( whistling )

04:09.416 --> 04:11.583
Hey, Mr. Candle.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.952
Oh, hello, Marco.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.887
I appreciate
all your guidance

04:15.889 --> 04:17.556
with Garbage Island
and all,

04:17.558 --> 04:19.625
but I'm gonna pass.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.730
Actually, I was just thinking
I might be...

04:24.732 --> 04:26.431
king of Mewni.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.966
( sputtering )
What?!

04:27.968 --> 04:29.635
The thing is,
Star and I

04:29.637 --> 04:31.937
have recently become
smooch buddies.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.539
On the lips.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.875
Even if that's true, kid,
you shouldn't say that out loud.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.777
Yeah, we've been trying
all styles.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.413
German, Italian...

04:41.415 --> 04:43.048
Polynesian.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.884
My tonsils are so tired,
I can't feel my teeth.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.955
( ferocious growl )

04:49.957 --> 04:53.892
Busted. I knew you weren't
a guidance counselor.

04:57.096 --> 05:00.999
Oh. These women
look so miserable.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.102
( sighs heavily )

05:04.104 --> 05:07.472
MIRROR:  <i>Calling Mom.</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:09.007
<i>What did you do?</i>

05:09.009 --> 05:10.976
What... nothing!

05:10.978 --> 05:12.811
Yet.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.813
I'd like to
ask you something.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.948
Are you happy?

05:16.950 --> 05:20.118
<i>Happy? What difference</i>
<i>does that make?</i>

05:20.120 --> 05:22.688
I mean, I don't know.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.690
Do you have
any warnicorns?

05:26.259 --> 05:28.794
<i>Goffrey, do I have</i>
<i>any warnicorns?</i>

05:28.796 --> 05:31.430
<i>You have 19,</i>
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

05:31.432 --> 05:33.632
<i>- Oh. Apparently,</i>
<i>I have 19.</i>
<i>- Oh, sweet.</i>

05:33.634 --> 05:36.301
<i>But when you are queen, you</i>
<i>don't have time for warnicorns.</i>

05:36.303 --> 05:39.004
<i>Everything I'm saying</i>
<i>is in your guide book.</i>

05:39.006 --> 05:41.006
<i>Incidentally, you may want</i>
<i>to review the chapter</i>

05:41.008 --> 05:42.974
<i>on hair care.</i>

05:42.976 --> 05:46.011
If you're going to be queen,
<i>you have to look the part.</i>

05:46.013 --> 05:48.013
<i>Don't worry so much</i>
<i>about happiness.</i>

05:48.015 --> 05:51.016
<i>It makes you look pale.</i>
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

06:05.298 --> 06:08.033
( buzzing )

06:08.035 --> 06:11.002
Stop! I knew
you were listening.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.571
I never made out with Star.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.974
I just said that
to get your goat.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.576
What?

06:17.578 --> 06:19.144
You lied to me.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.546
Well, you lied to Star.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.883
You made her think
all she's good for
is being queen.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.222
Dude, just take me home.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.892
I can't do that.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.761
You know too much.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.729
Now I gotta destroy you.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.898
What?!
That's not fair.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.333
All right, fine.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.235
Battle to the death.
I win, you die.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.103
What do I get
if I win?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.572
It's not gonna happen.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.075
So, yeah, ask for
whatever you want.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.911
If I win, you gotta
take me home.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.347
And you gotta tell Star
the truth.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.283
Fine.
Pick your weapon.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.685
Dueling battle axes?

07:00.687 --> 07:02.454
Rhino fiend joust?

07:02.456 --> 07:04.890
Pear grenades
of anguish?

07:04.892 --> 07:05.924
( shrieking )

07:08.561 --> 07:10.595
What about ping-pong?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.030
That's cool.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.933
Your weapon of choice,
my liege.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.768
I oughta warn you,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.303
I'm not only a karate master.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.872
I'm also good at
ball sports.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.543
Ow!

07:24.545 --> 07:28.046
Point, Master Tom.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.550
Okay, so I'm
a little rusty.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.552
Wait till you...
hi-yah!

07:33.554 --> 07:37.155
Owww!

07:55.441 --> 07:57.042
Game point.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.780
In your face!

08:01.782 --> 08:03.915
Ow! Ugh!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.917
Since when do ping-pong balls
hurt so much?

08:05.919 --> 08:08.086
These balls are
guided by demons.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.957
Okay. Let's play
for real this time.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.325
Double or nothing.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.694
Dude, you're
out of paddles.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.362
Just give up.

08:17.364 --> 08:20.499
No, it's fine.
Here, you can have mine.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.767
I don't need it.

08:24.103 --> 08:28.106
Hey! Isn't this
kind of cheating?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.674
You think this
is cheating?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.643
You should try playing
Star at ping-pong.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.311
Well, Star doesn't
really cheat.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.113
She just makes up
her own rules.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.817
And then she changes the rules
again halfway through the game.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.620
Oh, so that's why
I never win.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.222
She just does
whatever she wants.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.690
Yeah, that's Star.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.159
Yeah.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.195
She is kinda awesome.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.630
You know you're
never gonna win, right?

08:51.632 --> 08:55.200
I know, but
you're not either.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.669
It doesn't matter if
you beat me at ping-pong

08:57.671 --> 08:59.838
or pull out all my organs.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.206
You can't make Star
be your girlfriend

09:01.208 --> 09:03.375
unless she wants to.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.618
Star, I have something
to tell...

09:15.321 --> 09:16.388
Whoa.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.056
Oh, hey, Marco.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.091
Did you know that if you
cut off a mermaid's tail,

09:20.093 --> 09:22.594
you can never be queen?
It's all in the guide book.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.063
Star, you don't
have to do that.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.698
Oh, thank goodness.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.700
I'm so sorry, Tiffany.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.268
I never wanted to hurt you.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.504
Shameful.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.506
Tom! What's going on?

09:34.508 --> 09:36.508
I have something
I need to confess.

09:36.510 --> 09:39.744
I used Mr. Candle
to try to get
back together with you.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.681
It took me destroying
Marco 58 games to zero

09:42.683 --> 09:44.883
to realize I was wrong.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.352
Like, I slaughtered him.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.188
I mean, beating him
was so easy.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.357
Okay, she gets it.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.926
All I wanted
was to get you back.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.295
But I never stopped
to consider what you wanted.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.297
I'm sorry.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.102
Ow!

10:04.104 --> 10:06.137
You tricked me.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.105
But it doesn't even
make a difference.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.941
I'm still gonna
be queen.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.577
Yeah, but that doesn't
sound like a bad thing,

10:12.579 --> 10:14.713
because you're gonna
run Mewni your way.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.382
No matter how destructive.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.218
That's true.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.461
Point, Marco.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.665
Well, I should go.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.834
By the way,
I like your hair.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.809
STAR: So you guys
were hangin' out?

10:46.679 --> 10:47.746
Uh, yeah.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.115
Is he still
dark and broody?

10:50.117 --> 10:51.583
Oh, yeah.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.818
But he's not so bad.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.489
No, Brittany,
I don't believe

10:57.491 --> 10:59.691
your life has peaked
at such a young age.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.093
Dude, abort the mission.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.328
I'm done.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.330
( whistles )

11:17.343 --> 11:19.844
( growling noises )

11:24.650 --> 11:26.284
Star?

11:31.223 --> 11:33.458
I don't know
my combination!

11:45.137 --> 11:47.572
( gasps )
I'm... I'm...

11:47.574 --> 11:50.341
I'm wearing a suit!

11:50.343 --> 11:53.411
What are your plans
for the future, Mr. Diaz?

11:53.413 --> 11:54.512
Mr. Candle?

11:54.514 --> 11:57.515
GIRL: We're moving on
with our lives.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.418
But I haven't made up
my balloon yet.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.656
My red belt.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.725
I've been looking
all over for you.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.827
Wait!

12:08.829 --> 12:10.261
Come back.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.230
Marco. Marco, Marco!

12:12.232 --> 12:14.399
- Marco, Marco, Marco.
- ( screaming )

12:14.401 --> 12:15.700
- Star?
- You okay?

12:15.702 --> 12:17.502
Sounded like you were having

12:17.504 --> 12:19.204
one of those "stuck in life"
dreams again.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.207
Yeah. Wait. What are
you doing in here?

12:22.209 --> 12:25.243
I'm hanging my first
Love Sentence poster.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.512
You can be
my prisoner of love,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.848
Justin Towers.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.250
Uh... that's not
what I meant.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.852
I was sleeping.

12:33.854 --> 12:37.522
Oh! Right.
You have a hammer?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.924
I'm putting this bad boy up
Earth girl style.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.227
No majack!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.596
Yeah, all I'm saying is,

12:44.598 --> 12:47.265
you could've tried
knocking on my door,
Earth girl style.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.701
Why would I do that
when I have dimensional...

12:49.703 --> 12:51.402
Oh!

12:51.404 --> 12:55.406
How can I be so "duh"?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.642
Nothing's easy on Earth!
( laughs )

12:57.644 --> 13:01.412
I'm gonna find a hammer
the hard way.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.382
Scavenger hunt!

13:04.384 --> 13:07.018
Do we even have a hammer?

13:11.724 --> 13:13.725
Sensei, I need to
talk to you about

13:13.727 --> 13:15.994
- graduating to a red--
- Silence!

13:15.996 --> 13:18.630
I'm about to achieve
oneness with the universe.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.935
( inhales loudly )

13:23.937 --> 13:27.639
( unintelligible muttering
and grunting )

13:29.308 --> 13:31.142
Now, bow to your sensei.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.513
Master, I've been
a green belt for five years.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.182
It's time for me
to level up.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.484
( laughter )

13:39.486 --> 13:40.952
Five years, and you
think you're ready?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.520
Go get an ice cream cone
or something,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.289
and quit wasting
my Saturday.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.523
Sensei, I'm serious.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.325
Are you sure?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.527
The training you desire
has broken many a student.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.463
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.465
Fine.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.101
We start...  <i>now!</i>

13:57.103 --> 13:59.404
- Clip the toenail.
- Seriously?
- Clip the toenail!!

14:01.941 --> 14:04.008
- Plunge the toilet.
- Ugh.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.410
Take the deduction.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.549
Is your moment of failure
at hand, Mr. Diaz?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.251
No, sensei.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.357
Hey, guys!

14:19.359 --> 14:21.492
Just ignore me.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.028
Why exactly are we
ignoring you?

14:24.030 --> 14:26.998
I'm scavenging the house
for a hammer.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.334
Just pretend
I'm not here.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.903
Okey-dokey.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.205
- Do we even
have a hammer?
- No.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.040
( groaning )

14:36.042 --> 14:38.743
If I was a hammer...

14:38.745 --> 14:41.579
- I'd be up there!
- ( dogs barking )

14:41.581 --> 14:44.148
We have to do something.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.817
That's right, Mr. Diaz.

14:45.819 --> 14:48.353
Feel the squeegee
deep in your soul.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.388
Preparation is key.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.390
- You never know when
trouble will arrive.
- ( horn honks )

14:52.392 --> 14:54.559
- Hello, dear.
- Mom!

14:54.561 --> 14:57.829
How nice to have you...
visit me at my own house.

14:57.831 --> 15:00.531
It's nice to see you finally
getting to those windows.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.500
And you have
a little friend helping you.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.702
Maybe I'll fix you
a big helper's snack.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.271
Your mom seems nice.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.072
Oh, yes, she often
comes to see me.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.440
But not too often,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.609
on account of her
having her own home.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.578
I'm glad you made
that distinction,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.513
because it almost seemed
like this was her house.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.448
Here you go, boys.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.584
If you need me,
I'll be taking a nap
in my room.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.885
Okay?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.787
Okay.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.622
It's clear that
you live at home,

15:24.624 --> 15:28.526
in a room that is
unsettlingly similar to mine.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.894
Uh... great.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.896
Then you'll have
no problem cleaning it.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.631
Wait a minute.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.600
Are you training me
for a red belt,

15:35.602 --> 15:37.201
or are you making me do
all your chores?

15:37.203 --> 15:38.903
No, no, we're training.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.772
Ha! Cut the toenail.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.875
Ugh! I think I've
more than earned my red belt.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.611
Uh, you can't because...

15:46.613 --> 15:48.880
I, uh...

15:48.882 --> 15:51.482
( sobbing )

15:51.484 --> 15:54.118
- Because I'm also
only a green belt.
- What?!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.421
I didn't know what
I wanted to do with my life

15:56.423 --> 15:58.923
so I rented a dojo
and ordered these
instructional videotapes.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.726
Each tape told me what to learn
to get each color belt.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.429
It was going
pretty well at first,

16:04.431 --> 16:06.497
- but I only watched as far
as the green belt tape.
- Why'd you stop there?

16:06.499 --> 16:09.634
Because the red belt tape
got stuck in the machine.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.570
Now it just holds up
the short leg on
my computer table.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.673
Couldn't you just try
to get the tape out
and untangle it?

16:15.675 --> 16:19.510
I did, but that tape
got stuck in another machine!

16:19.512 --> 16:22.347
What kind of sensei
can't even work a VCR?

16:23.949 --> 16:26.751
( breathes deeply )

16:26.753 --> 16:30.188
Well, we can totally
find it online.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.624
Except we can't.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.428
It seems like this is
one of the rarest sets of
videotapes in existence.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.697
I guess we'll just
have to find it IRL.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.299
No way.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.701
I owe those guys
too much in back taxes.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.670
IRL means
in real life.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.172
We just have to find
a copy somewhere out there.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.341
I see. In that case,

16:50.343 --> 16:51.909
we'll need wheels.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.779
( Marco laughing )

16:54.781 --> 16:57.281
- To adventure!
- Feel the wind
in my tassels!

16:57.283 --> 16:58.649
( dog barking )

16:58.651 --> 17:01.619
Mom, call Rocket.
He's being weird.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.122
( loud clattering noises )

17:06.492 --> 17:08.860
( groaning )

17:08.862 --> 17:13.731
Find... hammer.

17:17.469 --> 17:19.003
What is this place?

17:19.005 --> 17:20.538
It's cool.
You'll love it.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.242
Yuck. Come on.
It's like a yard sale,
but inside.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.977
These are the only
kind of places

17:25.979 --> 17:27.745
you can find
old videotapes anymore.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.480
- Is that it?
- No.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.215
- Is that it?
- No.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.051
- Is that it?
- Nope.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.986
- Is that?
- Nope.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.487
Got it. Never mind.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.389
This is how to karaoke.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.991
This is impossible!

17:39.993 --> 17:41.592
We're never
gonna find it.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.594
Come on,
we just got here.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.997
Why don't you go check
one of those other bookcases?

17:45.999 --> 17:47.899
Sensei?

17:49.601 --> 17:52.370
How about grape and cherry?
Ooh, you know what?

17:52.372 --> 17:55.573
Just squirt every flavor
you got on it zombie style.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.176
- Ooh, yeah.
- Why'd you leave?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.745
Got some cash? I don't
get my allowance till Friday.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.780
Oh, uh... here.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.118
Fifty-one, 52, 53...

18:07.120 --> 18:08.920
Sensei?
What are you doing?

18:08.922 --> 18:11.255
Dude, these chicks
totally dig my bike.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.257
- Are you for real?
- What?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.560
You don't really wanna
earn your red belt, do you?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.728
Look, we tried
and we failed.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.564
And that's okay.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.099
It's not okay.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.234
I actually wanted
to be like you,

18:23.236 --> 18:24.969
but you're just like me,

18:24.971 --> 18:26.804
except I'm not gonna end up
38 years old

18:26.806 --> 18:28.639
and still living
with my parents.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.976
- I'll see ya later.
- Where you going?

18:31.978 --> 18:34.979
I'm going to find that tape
and get my red belt.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.215
Uh, bow to
your sensei.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.817
I don't have
a sensei anymore.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.487
So where am I gonna
look next?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.988
I could check
more thrift stores,

18:43.990 --> 18:45.223
but what are the odds I'll...
oh!

18:45.225 --> 18:47.725
Bump into it?

18:50.496 --> 18:52.096
You are no cinephile.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.798
Next.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.168
I'm looking for a rare set of
karate instructional tapes.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.837
Finally. A customer who
knows what he's talking about.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.006
It's the How To Karate series.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.741
The red belt tape.

19:03.743 --> 19:07.678
Behold, the coveted
volume 8 red belt cassette.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.280
Viewed only once.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.817
I've been looking
all over for you.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.185
Not without
gloves, please.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.953
Okay. How much is it?

19:15.955 --> 19:18.956
I will give you
the aficionado price. 2,400.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.491
Dollars?!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.293
I can't afford that.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.163
Well, there is another way.
Fight me for it.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.032
Really? Yeah, okay.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.908
I'm not leaving
without that tape.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.944
Hey, Marco.
I'm still your sensei, right?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.751
Sensei, he has the tape.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.763
Mr. Diaz,
clip the toenail!

20:39.538 --> 20:41.172
You... defeated me.

20:41.174 --> 20:44.141
The tape is yours.

20:45.844 --> 20:48.913
Can you ask him if he has
the How To Untangle

20:48.915 --> 20:51.349
Multiple VHS Tapes
VHS tape.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.050
No. Do you have
a pair of scissors?

20:53.052 --> 20:54.952
Actually, we--

20:54.954 --> 20:56.520
Not the critically
acclaimed

20:56.522 --> 20:57.888
award-winning
romantic comedy

20:57.890 --> 20:59.523
<i>A Pair of Scissors.</i>

20:59.525 --> 21:01.926
An actual
pair of scissors.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.461
No.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.929
It's okay, guys.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.964
I'm done.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.432
Go on without me.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.035
- ( clattering )
- A hammer!

21:11.037 --> 21:12.803
( both sighing )

21:12.805 --> 21:15.573
Now I just need
to find some nails.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.775
Back to the store.

21:20.145 --> 21:22.980
You know, red is
really your color.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.783
It's yours too, sensei.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.820
I'd say this Earth girl
did a job well done.

21:29.822 --> 21:34.025
Now, let's clean this house
the easy way.
