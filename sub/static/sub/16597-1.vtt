WEBVTT

00:02.903 --> 00:04.172
Okay, Mr. Davis.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.640
This Azelastine should
take care of those allergies.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.808
Thank you.

00:07.875 --> 00:11.812
Hay-fever season wreaks
havoc on my sinuses.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.781
Well, is there anything
else I can do for you?

00:13.847 --> 00:16.584
No.
I'm just trying to spend
more time with my patients

00:16.650 --> 00:18.119
to make sure they don't
feel shortchanged.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.287
That's okay.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.754
I feel like I got
correct changed.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.390
(LAUGHS) Good!

00:22.456 --> 00:23.757
Then we can talk about me.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.461
Ooh, a lot of stuff
been going on with me lately.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.064
My resident, Julie,
left to do a pediatric
fellowship, and...

00:30.131 --> 00:32.766
Oh! I tried stand-up comedy
at the Laugh Factory.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.468
Spoiler alert...
I killed.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.536
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:35.603 --> 00:36.637
If I could just...

00:36.704 --> 00:38.038
And that's the problem

00:38.106 --> 00:40.641
when you're blessed
with two massive talents.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.178
Comedy, medicine...
Where can I do the most good?

00:44.812 --> 00:45.879
Are you asking me?

00:45.946 --> 00:48.249
No, it's rhetorical.

00:48.316 --> 00:51.085
Anyway, I decided
to go lives over laughs

00:51.152 --> 00:52.686
because what matters
to me most

00:52.753 --> 00:54.522
are my patients
and their needs.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.923
And... Oh.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.057
And I know what you need...

00:57.125 --> 00:59.460
To get to the pharmacy
before it closes?

00:59.527 --> 01:00.861
(LAUGHS)
No, silly.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.431
A link to my website where
you can watch my performance.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.567
(CHUCKLES)
Have fun, stay healthy,

01:06.634 --> 01:09.002
and I'll see you back
in a week to treat
your split sides.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.304
Ooh.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.506
Looks like staying in medicine
was the right call.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.074
(LAUGHS) Okay.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.676
Leave the jokes to me,
sniffles.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.417
Poor Allison.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.886
I mean, she's been killing
herself at work lately.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.288
Last night, she was like,

01:27.355 --> 01:29.557
"Wah! I work so hard, baby.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.759
"I never get to see
the kids. Wah!"

01:33.261 --> 01:36.264
Are you sympathizing
with her or mocking her?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.698
I should cut her some slack.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.267
She is in a tough sitch.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.802
Well, she is the one who said
"I do" all those years ago.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.637
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:43.704 --> 01:45.939
No, it's her
psychiatry practice.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.875
She's been wall-to-wall
with patients,

01:47.941 --> 01:49.143
her commute is brutal.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.711
She complains
about it constantly.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.112
Let me guess...
"Wah!"

01:52.180 --> 01:54.215
Whoa, dude,
that's not cool.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.383
That's my wife
you're talking about.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.920
Hey, Ken, I couldn't help
but hear you bloviate

01:59.987 --> 02:01.922
about Allison's work woes,

02:01.989 --> 02:03.224
and, well,
we do have an opening

02:03.291 --> 02:05.926
here at Welltopia
in the Looney Wing.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.129
I really don't think
it's appropriate
to call it that.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.031
Well, if Robert
and Eleanor Looney

02:11.098 --> 02:13.601
are generous enough to endow
our psychiatric wing,

02:13.667 --> 02:16.304
then I will honor them
by using their name.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.240
So what do you think,
Ken?

02:19.307 --> 02:20.874
You think Allison
would be interested?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.210
Here?
Mmm-hmm.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.811
Where I work?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

02:23.877 --> 02:24.912
Oof baboof.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.980
I really think
she'd miss her commute.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.850
Uh, but you just said
her commute was brutal.

02:29.917 --> 02:33.153
Um, no. Brutal,
as in epic. Sick!

02:33.221 --> 02:35.256
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Keep up with
the lingo, gramps.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.725
(GROANS) I mean,
your wife is a gem,

02:37.791 --> 02:40.694
and having her here
would just be...so brutal.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.364
Call Allison Park.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.732
Your Blackberry
doesn't do that.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.033
No,
I was talking to Clark.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.135
Call Allison Park.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.570
No, no, no, Clark.
No, uh... No.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.939
She's with a patient.
You know?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.707
Probably gonna be
a long sesh.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.109
No calls during a sesh?
Damn it!

02:56.176 --> 02:59.447
That's just the kind of
go-getter we need around here.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.550
You mark my words, Ken...
I will have you wife.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.319
I mean professionally.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.621
I mean, I'd never be
inappropriate with a coworker.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.590
Well, except for ones
that I find irresistible.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.191
Don't do that.
Good call.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.828
Okay. So let me
get this straight.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.397
You wouldn't want Allison
working here

03:16.464 --> 03:18.198
even though it would make
her life easier?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.133
Look, don't get me wrong.
Allison's my wife.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.536
You know,
I think she might be the one.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.438
But I think we need

03:24.505 --> 03:26.374
a little healthy
separation sometimes.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.775
You know, I mean,
if I can't do

03:27.841 --> 03:30.010
spot-on impressions of my wife
behind her back,

03:30.077 --> 03:31.445
then why am I here?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.081
To cure sick people?

03:34.147 --> 03:36.517
Oh, good.
Good looking out.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.920
I mean, I get it.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.255
You wouldn't want to work
with your boyfriend every day.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.956
Wait.
What does Connor do, anyway?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.760
Okay, here's the interesting
thing about that.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.398
I don't know.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.032
(SCOFFS) But... But you've
been together for like...

03:52.099 --> 03:53.267
Three months.
Yeah, I know.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.802
And he told me
on our first date,

03:54.868 --> 03:57.037
but I was so busy
picturing us hiking.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.608
He was carrying our water.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.444
I was carrying our twins.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.215
I mean, I know I should have
asked him to repeat himself,
but I didn't.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.017
And now it just feels like
too much time has passed.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.585
So what? You just don't
talk about work?

04:11.652 --> 04:14.254
Oh, no, no.
He talks about work
all the time.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.989
Like, I know
there's this woman, Elyse,

04:16.056 --> 04:18.559
who constantly steals
his yogurt from the
break-room fridge.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.494
And I know there's this guy,
Christophe,

04:20.561 --> 04:21.895
who everyone thinks
is so smart

04:21.962 --> 04:23.196
but really,
he's just Belgian.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.698
Yo.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.401
That yogurt nonsense
is messed up.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.137
No, the whole thing
is "messed up."

04:30.203 --> 04:32.039
He should write
his name on it.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.509
I know I should be able
to tell him anything,

04:35.576 --> 04:36.710
but he's just...
He's so sensitive.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.011
What if he freaks out?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.179
I... I can't risk it.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.414
Look.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.783
Here's one thing
that I know for sure.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.554
Somebody eat my yogurt,
they gonna hear about it!

04:46.620 --> 04:48.121
You know what?
Let me go check
this refrigerator.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.023
Somebody might
be in my stuff and I...

04:57.498 --> 04:58.499
(GROANS)

05:00.901 --> 05:02.536
Yes!

05:02.603 --> 05:03.704
What are you doing?

05:03.771 --> 05:06.440
This is how I keep
my Roshambo game sharp.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.975
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

05:08.041 --> 05:10.077
Check it out.
Just got my SAT scores.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.479
How'd you do?

05:11.545 --> 05:14.014
Haven't opened it yet,
but I think we both know.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.850
What?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.151
Oh, no!

05:18.218 --> 05:19.753
Well,
at least you're pretty.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.223
How did this happen?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.759
I am super smart,
both book and street.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.395
I was prepared.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.662
I thought I did well.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.431
I dropped the pencil
like a mike.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.033
Mom and dad
are gonna freak out.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.267
They're high-achieving
doctors

05:34.334 --> 05:36.103
who poured all their hopes
and dreams into me!

05:36.169 --> 05:37.805
No offense.
None taken.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.740
What am I gonna do?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.642
Maybe mom and dad
don't have to know.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.110
Just take it again,
do better,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.145
and that's the score
you show them.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.080
But that'll take months.
They know my scores
were due any day.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.549
Leave that part to me.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.451
I'm a master strategist.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.320
When they're expecting paper,
we'll throw scissors.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.156
Not literally.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.758
I know what a metaphor is.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.092
Do you?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.833
Mom stuck in traffic again?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.936
Yeah. She feels bad,
but she said we should
eat without her.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.372
I hate being
a latchkey kid.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.307
Latchkey kids don't have
any adult supervision.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.177
I stand by it.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.213
Hey, if no one's supervising,

06:20.280 --> 06:23.316
then who made you
these sick PB and J's?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.154
I'm getting notes
of candy coating.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.590
Oh, yeah, well,
we're out of peanut butter,

06:29.657 --> 06:32.693
so I had to use
Reese's Pieces, and...

06:32.760 --> 06:33.894
Oh! Horizontal!
Horizontal!

06:33.961 --> 06:36.029
(LAUGHS) Okay.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.501
Ooh. So Mol,
still no SAT scores?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.636
Not yet.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.605
Man, they should be here
any day now, shouldn't they?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.207
Not necessarily.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.777
There's some issue with
the SAT scores and e-mail,

06:49.843 --> 06:51.111
to hear NPR tell it.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.946
Really?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.949
Dad, enough about us.
Let's talk about you.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.451
Aww. Thanks, Dave.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.586
Mol, learn from this.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.055
Wine me. Hard.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.356
Sorry, guys.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.592
The commute took even longer

07:04.658 --> 07:06.560
because Waze and I
are in a fight.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.801
And ever since they raised
my office rent,

07:13.867 --> 07:15.536
I have to make time
for every nutface

07:15.603 --> 07:17.137
who walks
through the door.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.271
And of course,
every one of them

07:18.338 --> 07:19.473
has a different
insurance company.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.308
And that's fun.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.645
'Cause I went to Yale
to become a bookkeeper.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.614
Did you wine me?
Oh, you already drank it,
sunshine.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.716
Oh, come on!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

07:28.782 --> 07:29.983
(SIGHS)

07:30.050 --> 07:32.185
I swear, the only thing
that's keeping me going

07:32.252 --> 07:35.055
is that yoga class I'm gonna
squeeze in at lunch tomorrow.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.324
Man, you're able to get away
to do yoga?

07:37.390 --> 07:38.759
Sweet gig!

07:38.826 --> 07:40.393
I would stay
at that job forever,

07:40.460 --> 07:41.829
come what may.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.031
Dad made sandwiches.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.466
Thank God.
I worked through lunch again.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.706
Are there
Reese's Pieces on this?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.075
Sorry.
We're out of peanut butter,
and I had to improvi...

07:55.142 --> 07:57.711
Don't you ever apologize
for candy on a sandwich.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.680
Freakin' amazing.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.248
(BOTH LAUGH)

08:02.650 --> 08:04.918
But not an
acceptable dinner, kids.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.955
So, SAT scores come yet?

08:08.021 --> 08:11.525
E-mail backlog, NPR,
we already covered it, yawn.

08:13.293 --> 08:16.964
Oh, well,
I'm glad you covered it.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.431
Shouldn't we be getting
a hard copy?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.635
Not if the postal
strike happens.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.503
What postal strike?

08:23.571 --> 08:26.173
The one that's looming,
to hear NPR tell it.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.643
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

08:29.710 --> 08:32.279
Why do I have a voicemail
from Pat in your office?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.314
Oh, that.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

08:34.381 --> 08:35.983
Pat, I mean
he's always saying,

08:36.049 --> 08:37.985
"Say hi to Allison for me."

08:38.051 --> 08:40.387
But he thinks I never do it,
so you can delete that one.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.222
No, I'll listen to it
just to be sure.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.423
No.
Come on, come on.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.992
No one listens
to voicemails anymore.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
Get with it, grandma.
(CHUCKLES)

08:47.127 --> 08:49.429
My dad's left several
over the last week.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.598
Delete.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.733
What's wrong with you?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.968
(OVER VOICEMAIL)
Allison, Pat Hein here.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.904
First of all, hi.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.439
I'm not sure
Ken passed that along.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.242
Second, we have an opening
at the psychiatry clinic

09:02.309 --> 09:05.078
here at Welltopia that I think
you'd be perfect for.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.582
Call back to discuss,
and have a brutal day.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.821
Pat's offering me a job
where you work?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.522
Yeah, and I know
it's tempting,

09:15.589 --> 09:16.924
but honestly,
we should really consider...

09:16.990 --> 09:20.694
Tempting? Oh, God no.
Please. (LAUGHS)

09:20.761 --> 09:22.663
Working with you all the time?
I don't think so.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.397
(LAUGHS)

09:26.033 --> 09:28.301
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

09:30.003 --> 09:31.538
Can you imagine?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.674
There is not enough yoga
in the world.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.242
(LAUGHS)

09:35.308 --> 09:38.178
(LAUGHS) Really?
'Cause there's a lot of yoga.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.947
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:40.013 --> 09:41.815
(LAUGHING)

09:44.151 --> 09:45.619
Why are you laughing?

09:45.686 --> 09:48.088
I don't know.
Sugar high from my sandwich?

09:48.155 --> 09:49.289
(LAUGHS)

09:57.297 --> 09:59.166
Baby, thank you so much
for bringing me breakfast.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.034
Ugh, I had to get out
of that office.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.871
The list of the top
10 companies in our
industry came out,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.338
and we were not on it.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.874
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.476
(MOUTHING) Ask him now.
I guess
that industry is...

10:09.542 --> 10:10.543
(MOUTHING) Ask him.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.513
...very competitive.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.417
Hey, Connor.
What you do again?
Hey.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.551
Oh, uh, well, I'm a...

10:18.618 --> 10:19.887
(LOUD GRINDING)

10:23.123 --> 10:24.224
(GRINDING STOPS)
Hey!

10:24.291 --> 10:27.227
Check out my new cordless
coffee grinder.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.796
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
What was that?

10:28.862 --> 10:30.063
Oh, no problem.
I'm a, uh...

10:30.130 --> 10:31.398
(GRINDING CONTINUES)

10:35.168 --> 10:36.870
Oh, I like
a really fine grind.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.271
Oh.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.740
Hey, I got to go.
Lunch?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.408
Yes, absolutely,
I'll see you at 1:00.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.576
Bye. Mwah.
Back to the salt mines.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.612
Yeah. (GROANS)

10:45.679 --> 10:47.514
Well,
there's your answer.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.648
Salt miner.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.052
Although he's a little more
business casual

10:52.119 --> 10:55.455
than most of the salties
I run with.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.692
Hey, Ken,
I reached out to Allison
about that job.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.828
But not unlike my ex-wife
on our honeymoon,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.963
she had that "no"
locked and loaded.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.132
Yeah, she doesn't think

11:05.198 --> 11:07.034
us working in the same place
is the best idea.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.837
Uh, well, that's the
understatement of the year.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.972
You know, I offered her
extra vacation time,

11:12.039 --> 11:15.542
an increase
in pay and bonuses,
and she would not bite.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.577
She wouldn't?
No.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.248
She must really not want
to be around you.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.684
But don't worry.
I'll break her.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.053
Hey, you wouldn't
consider quitting?

11:27.454 --> 11:29.757
Ah, never mind.
I'll think of something else.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.160
But, for now, you quitting
is the idea to beat.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.095
(COFFEE GRINDING)

11:41.601 --> 11:45.939
Focus on your breathing.
This is a safe space.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.276
All your problems stay
outside the door.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.478
(VOICE BREAKING) Allison,
our marriage is in trouble!

11:53.280 --> 11:54.815
Sorry.
One of mine got in.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.350
Sorry.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.794
Okay, why are you
spinning out this time?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.830
You've been talking
about leaving private
practice for months.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.934
And yet, you turn down
the perfect opportunity
because of me?

12:14.001 --> 12:15.402
That really hurts,
Allison.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.570
Is being around me
so objectionable to you?

12:17.637 --> 12:20.473
At this moment
or in general?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.409
I'm serious.
When Pat told me

12:22.475 --> 12:24.377
about the possibility
of us working together,

12:24.444 --> 12:28.215
I was like, "Hot damn.
Make that happen, Pat Hein."

12:28.281 --> 12:31.251
Okay, look.
This isn't just about
not wanting to work with you.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.653
Although you are
a big presence at Welltopia,

12:33.720 --> 12:35.388
and I'd always
be in your shadow.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.825
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.861
But I've also worked hard
to build my own practice,

12:40.928 --> 12:44.965
and I'm not sure
I'm ready to let it go
and become an employee.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.267
To steal a phrase
from your wedding toast,

12:47.334 --> 12:49.736
"I don't know how I feel
about losing my autonomy."

12:52.605 --> 12:56.443
That was actually
the rehearsal dinner, but...

12:56.509 --> 12:59.579
So what you're saying is,
this is more about your career

12:59.646 --> 13:02.215
and not a problem
between you and me?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.451
(CHUCKLING)
You and I are fine.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.585
(SIGHS)

13:05.652 --> 13:06.987
It's not about that.

13:07.054 --> 13:10.023
It's about me
valuing what I do.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.959
Well...

13:13.393 --> 13:15.628
...you're not the only one
who values what you do.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.730
I do, too.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.432
Always have,

13:19.499 --> 13:21.068
and I'll always be here
to support you.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.836
(CHUCKLES)

13:22.903 --> 13:24.637
Thanks, Ken.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.606
I needed that.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.341
Everything's gotten
so stressful.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.710
What about the yoga class?
Doesn't that help?

13:30.777 --> 13:32.112
Some days
more than others.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.747
Are you kidding me?

13:41.021 --> 13:43.323
So then I'm like, "With all
due respect, Christophe,

13:43.390 --> 13:44.624
"shouldn't we present
these ideas

13:44.691 --> 13:46.626
"before the conference
call to Denver?"

13:46.693 --> 13:48.528
I mean,
what is he thinking?
Right?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.829
Right? (CHUCKLES)

13:49.897 --> 13:51.198
Like, it's like...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.499
It's like (BELGIAN ACCENT)
Come on, Christophe.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.601
Get with the
program. Aah!

13:57.204 --> 13:59.072
Oh. This is nice.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.607
I have never been
in a relationship

14:00.673 --> 14:03.676
where I could be so honest
about who I am and what I do.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.980
(NORMAL VOICE) Yeah.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.019
Okay.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.722
In that same spirit,
I have to say something.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.325
Oh. What is it?

14:18.391 --> 14:20.894
I have no idea
what you do at that office.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.364
What?
Yeah.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.466
Sorry.
Just not a clue.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.370
Wow. Uh, you know what?

14:31.571 --> 14:32.973
I got to go.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.507
Wait, what?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.176
I just need
a little time.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.612
(DOOR CLOSES)

14:39.679 --> 14:40.747
(SCOFFS)

14:41.681 --> 14:42.849
Damn it.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.388
Dave,
the mail is here.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.923
Ooh! Is that Modern Chef?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.724
I'm already salivating.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.693
No! This is bad.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.595
If we're pretending
there's a postal strike,

14:55.662 --> 14:57.364
mom and dad can't see
a stack of mail!

14:57.430 --> 14:58.698
(MAIL THUDS)
Wow.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.167
Where was that kind
of problem solving

15:00.233 --> 15:01.601
when you took that test?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.273
Hey, guys.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.075
"Hey, guys." Hilarious.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.643
Does this guy
have an off switch? See ya.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.715
So, how was your day?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.150
It was fine.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.886
So, want to talk about this?

15:21.088 --> 15:22.155
How did you get that?

15:22.222 --> 15:23.456
Come on.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.458
When my 11-year-old tells me
there's a mail strike

15:25.525 --> 15:27.627
and I see the mailman
delivering our mail...

15:27.694 --> 15:29.362
(CHUCKLES)

15:29.429 --> 15:31.731
I put two and two together
and realized

15:31.798 --> 15:33.600
it must have been
a super-short strike

15:33.666 --> 15:35.468
that got resolved
right away.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.639
So, why didn't you tell us?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.408
I thought you'd be upset.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.310
It's just a test.
You can always
take it again.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.845
(SIGHS) I don't
know what happened.
I thought I was prepared.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.514
(SCOFFS) Hmm. Been there.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.116
(CHUCKLES)
Really?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.483
Yeah. I'm just like you.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.154
First time I took the SATs,
I tanked it.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.688
Was grandpa as understanding
as you are?

15:55.755 --> 15:58.058
No, he was not.
(CHUCKLES)

15:58.125 --> 16:01.361
(KOREAN ACCENT) "What's wrong
with you? These scores
so low, even for American kid!

16:01.428 --> 16:02.629
"Eh!"

16:04.998 --> 16:07.267
(NORMAL VOICE) But you know,
I took 'em again
and did better,

16:07.334 --> 16:08.868
got into Duke,
became a doctor,

16:08.935 --> 16:12.172
so I know how you feel.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.541
Everything's always come
so easy for me.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.276
What if it
doesn't anymore?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.778
What if I don't get
into a good school?

16:18.845 --> 16:22.049
Dad... I'm scared.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.518
Well, you know,

16:25.585 --> 16:28.455
sometimes life is scary,
but you know what?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.890
I never worry about you.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.859
You got this.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.827
You're gonna be fine.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.963
Thanks, Dad.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.131
I love you.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.399
Love you more.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.172
Hi.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.306
Oh, hey, mom.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.341
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.177
Yeah, Molly didn't do so well
on her SATs.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.379
But she'll take 'em again.
It'll be fine.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.447
I've got everything
under control.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.582
KitKat panini?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.951
Please come home
and make dinner tomorrow.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.820
We're almost out
of Halloween candy.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.291
Good news... the postal
strike is over.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.560
Bad news...our mail got
shredded by birds.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.164
Thanks, Dave,
but they know.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.733
You mean I tore up
my Modern Chef for nothing?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.969
It was
their truffle issue!

17:21.808 --> 17:23.076
And then he walked out,

17:23.143 --> 17:24.444
and I haven't heard
from him since.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.113
(STAMMERS) I knew I shouldn't
have said anything.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.715
I have ruined the best
relationship of my life.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.049
Well, you know what?

17:30.117 --> 17:31.851
If Connor walked out
on you for that,

17:31.918 --> 17:34.587
then maybe your relationship
wasn't as great
as you thought it was.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.624
Oh! Says the lady who hasn't
had a boyfriend in two years.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.028
Look. Hi.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.131
Hi. Oh, my God. Hi.
Hi.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.265
I'm so sorry
about last night.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.866
No, you were right.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.302
I was?
Yep.
You put it perfectly...

17:49.369 --> 17:51.070
"What do I do
at that office?"

17:52.205 --> 17:53.906
That was my question.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.743
I have spent four years
at a job I don't even like,

17:56.809 --> 17:58.445
and you opened my eyes.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.581
So, this morning,
I marched right down
to Amalgamated, and I quit.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.015
(LAUGHS)

18:03.082 --> 18:05.585
So thank you for giving me
the courage to do this.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.157
You're welcome.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.425
And because of you,
I am finally free

18:12.492 --> 18:14.127
to pursue my dream.
(GASPS)

18:14.194 --> 18:17.063
Baby,
I am so happy for you.
(LAUGHS)

18:17.130 --> 18:18.865
All right.
I'll see you tonight?
Yeah.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.770
I have no idea
what his dream is.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.377
Hey. How did everything go
with Allison yesterday?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.611
Oh, it's all good.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.813
Yeah, she decided
she's not gonna work here.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.482
She was like, "Wah!

18:35.548 --> 18:37.884
"I can't focus
when I'm around you, Ken.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.586
"I love you
so much. Wah!"

18:41.621 --> 18:42.855
You know how needy
she is.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.791
No, Ken. Tell us.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.892
How needy is she?

18:45.958 --> 18:49.196
Hey, you!

18:49.262 --> 18:50.730
Yeah! Oh, this?

18:50.797 --> 18:59.272
No, we were talking
about Allison... Wonderland.

18:59.339 --> 19:03.310
"Wah! I'm through
the looking glass, baby.
Wah!"

19:04.344 --> 19:06.313
Great save.
Thank you.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.315
Can we, uh...?
Hmm?

19:08.381 --> 19:09.649
Can we...?
Hmm?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.251
Oh, my God.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.493
I can't stop thinking
about Pat's offer.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.595
Really?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.897
Yesterday when you said
you'd always support me,

19:24.964 --> 19:27.434
would that include
if I were to work here?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.068
Absolutely.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.538
Then I think
I'm gonna do it.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.605
I think you should.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.840
(CHUCKLES)

19:33.906 --> 19:35.242
Mmm.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.643
What made you change
your mind?

19:36.709 --> 19:37.910
Molly.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.045
It killed me last night

19:39.111 --> 19:40.780
watching you parent her
all by yourself,

19:40.847 --> 19:42.849
and I wasn't
there for her.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.252
And it hit me,
this is gonna be
her last year at home.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.819
Not necessarily.
Did you see those scores?

19:46.886 --> 19:47.987
J-K.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.456
L-O-L.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.157
Wink emoji.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.027
This is gonna be
a pivotal year for her,

19:55.094 --> 19:57.196
and Dave's starting
middle school.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.700
I want to be there
for them rather than battling
traffic on the 405

20:00.767 --> 20:04.771
while they're at home
eating candy sandwiches.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.674
Yeah, Dave was up
till 4:00 in the morning.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.809
I gave him a soda
and sent him back to bed.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.847
And I want you to be there
for them and for me.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.116
And it's time
for a new challenge.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.418
It is a good situation.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.554
I mean, who knew
I'd be making more than you?

20:21.621 --> 20:24.257
What? Geez.
What did Pat offer you?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.158
Everything!
I just kept saying no,

20:26.225 --> 20:27.960
and he kept thinking
I was playing hardball.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.530
(LAUGHS)

20:30.597 --> 20:32.965
You know what?
This is gonna be great.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.267
I think so, too.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.569
But, in the future,

20:36.636 --> 20:39.171
um, when you come
into our bullpen,

20:39.238 --> 20:42.074
is there any way
you could make a noise
or, you know,

20:42.141 --> 20:43.476
just like a little heads up?
(CHUCKLES)

20:43.543 --> 20:45.345
Like, "Wah"?

20:48.981 --> 20:50.116
It's not bad.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.451
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

20:56.623 --> 20:59.559
Well, a lot of big changes
afoot at Casa de Park.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.961
Yeah. You and I are gonna
be working together.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.663
Molly's
gonna be buckling down.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.998
And the mail strike is over,
thank God.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.468
Between the two of us,

21:08.535 --> 21:09.902
there's no challenge
we can't handle.

21:09.969 --> 21:10.970
(DOOR OPENS)

21:15.174 --> 21:16.509
Dad?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.044
(KOREAN ACCENT) Your mom's
in Korea for rest of the year.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.346
I live here now.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.583
What?
Check your voicemail!
