00:03.033 --> 00:04.300
Maxine, I question‐‐

00:04.366 --> 00:07.833
No, ah. I am not covering
your ass again for it.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.833
Are we a team?

00:09.900 --> 00:11.300
Alright, what is it?

00:11.366 --> 00:14.933
People v. Falcon. The defendant
is charged with possession

00:15.000 --> 00:17.733
with intent to sell.
He had no drugs on his person

00:17.800 --> 00:20.100
but he did have powder
all over his shoe.

00:22.466 --> 00:24.433
If one were to
mention plea bargaining

00:24.500 --> 00:26.033
your feeling would
be along the‐‐

00:26.100 --> 00:28.900
‐ No way.
‐ That's my feeling exactly.

00:28.966 --> 00:31.733
And if I were to refer
to a president, I might‐‐

00:31.800 --> 00:33.000
People v. Ricky.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.766
‐ Get out of my head.
‐ Get out of my face.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.533
People, people.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.166
Now, I just stopped
down to introduce you

00:42.233 --> 00:45.466
to your new supervisor,
Preston August.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.766
And now, folks, we're
really lucky to have him.

00:50.833 --> 00:54.133
So please, don't give him
any ulcers, migraines

00:54.200 --> 00:56.200
hives or facial ticks.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.940
It's good to see
you again, Maxine.

Oh, I know that, I was kinda
of hoping you'd wear em' later.

01:52.306 --> 01:55.273
Oh, well. Ignore that
red laced bra in your pile

01:55.340 --> 01:57.506
there's no message there.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.913
Hello, people.

02:02.980 --> 02:05.346
Seeing you wheel around
that trolley reminds me

02:05.413 --> 02:08.645
of my uncle, Levi. 'Course
he was transporting coffins

02:08.713 --> 02:10.946
but the technique
is very similar.

02:13.380 --> 02:17.846
Khadijah, I'm here to pick
up my 150 copies of Flavor.

02:17.913 --> 02:21.480
Well, you're a day early. It
doesn't come out until tomorrow.

02:21.546 --> 02:24.713
Khadijah, women in New York
are holding their breath

02:24.780 --> 02:27.613
awaiting the story
you did on <i>moi.</i>

02:29.813 --> 02:31.680
Well, tell them to exhale.

02:33.246 --> 02:35.180
It's only a picture
and a paragraph.

02:36.513 --> 02:39.846
Yeah, Kyle, you're one
of a bunch of men profile.

02:39.913 --> 02:42.646
Yes, but the others will simply
recede into the background

02:42.713 --> 02:45.080
once the women get
a load of me.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.246
It's called
the Barker effect, yeah.

02:51.246 --> 02:54.546
Yes, scientists been working
round the clock to find a cure.

02:54.613 --> 02:55.846
Yeah!

02:58.546 --> 03:01.986
Khadijah, I've begged you not
to put him in your magazine.

03:02.053 --> 03:04.786
But no, you just had to
do it, he already cleared

03:04.853 --> 03:07.220
off a whole wall
for his press clip.

03:07.286 --> 03:10.520
Even took down my diploma
and my graduate polaroid

03:10.586 --> 03:12.153
from the DeVry institute.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.586
I earned that!

03:19.786 --> 03:21.420
You two went shopping together?

03:21.486 --> 03:25.320
No, Max ran into me outside
and is helping with my bags.

03:27.053 --> 03:28.986
How come? That's not food.

03:31.386 --> 03:33.020
Can't I help a friend?

03:34.486 --> 03:38.386
Did you get with one of your
boy toys at lunch, today?

03:38.453 --> 03:40.953
No, I did not.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.253
I did however run
into an old friend.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.286
‐ Ah‐ha. I knew it was a man.
‐ Whoo!

03:45.353 --> 03:47.853
For a minute I thought
she was setting me up

03:47.920 --> 03:49.486
for a practical joke.

03:50.553 --> 03:53.653
So Max, who did you run into?

03:53.720 --> 03:54.986
You remember him.

03:55.053 --> 03:57.653
Preston August.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.326
Is that the guy you spent
all your beads on at Club Med?

04:01.393 --> 04:04.026
No, no. That was Augustedo,
he had only one name.

04:04.093 --> 04:06.826
Preston August the attorney,
I met a couple of years ago

04:06.893 --> 04:08.160
on that ski trip, yes.

04:08.226 --> 04:10.326
Oh, yeah. You'll
really hit it off.

04:10.393 --> 04:13.693
Yes, it was only repeated
and mind numbing sex

04:13.760 --> 04:15.660
that kept me from
falling in love.

04:17.660 --> 04:20.260
‐ So where did you see him?
‐ At my office.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.959
He's my new boss.

04:22.026 --> 04:26.426
‐ Oh, girl. You in danger.
‐ Oh, please.

04:26.493 --> 04:28.426
It's not about that.

04:28.493 --> 04:31.660
But still, you got to work for
somebody you've seen naked.

04:34.559 --> 04:35.993
Now that's distracting.

04:38.493 --> 04:40.226
Yeah, how do you think I feel

04:40.293 --> 04:42.793
every time I see Overton
change a light bulb. Uff.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.693
Well, it's not
about that.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.226
It's just nice to be working
with someone that I respect.

04:50.293 --> 04:53.093
Girl, I know you since
freshmen year, you lying.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.893
Okay, when I was with
Preston, it was good.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.626
But that's in the past. This
time it's strictly business.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.733
Mm‐mm. So when you
two getting together?

05:03.800 --> 05:04.966
Tomorrow night.

05:12.566 --> 05:14.800
Khadijah, girl,
good choice on

05:14.866 --> 05:16.933
the guy you picked
for number eight.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.800
But number 27,
who did you owe a favor?

05:21.733 --> 05:24.866
Regine this was
not a beauty contest.

05:24.933 --> 05:28.666
But look at number 34.
He is fine.

05:30.700 --> 05:34.166
Mm‐mm. If only you could
just turn that picture over.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.800
‐ See other side.
‐ I second that.

05:40.033 --> 05:41.766
You know, it's
comforting to know that

05:41.833 --> 05:44.333
when there are no men
around, you women can be

05:44.400 --> 05:46.566
just as raunchy as we are.

05:46.633 --> 05:49.433
It is a bit disheartening
to realize that right now

05:49.500 --> 05:52.133
you ladies seem to think,
there are no men around.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.666
Check out Kyle trying
to look all GQ.

05:56.733 --> 05:59.066
Oh, I didn't know he
was volunteer for

05:59.133 --> 06:01.273
The International Red Cross.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.706
Oh, he gave blood
all over Europe.

06:05.506 --> 06:08.006
He was a travelling
student and he did it so

06:08.073 --> 06:09.906
he could get free
punch and cookies.

06:11.206 --> 06:14.106
Here's another interesting
tit‐bit about Kyle.

06:14.173 --> 06:18.873
It says here he's married with
two children and one on the way.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.740
What the devil!

06:20.806 --> 06:22.406
You think you know someone.

06:24.673 --> 06:26.573
I can't believe,
I missed this.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.906
Somebody else's bio must
have got tacked onto Kyle's.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.843
Oh, Khadijah, he'll be
so in love with his picture

06:32.909 --> 06:35.176
he probably won't even notice.

06:35.243 --> 06:40.209
Mm, I wouldn't be so sure. Kyle
prides himself on two things

06:40.276 --> 06:42.043
his bachelorhood and his ability

06:42.109 --> 06:45.909
to raise one eyebrow
independently over the other.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.809
[knock on door]

06:47.876 --> 06:50.443
Hey, hey, alright.
Where is it? Where is it?

06:52.176 --> 06:54.276
‐ Why you gave it to him.
‐ He asked.

06:56.009 --> 06:58.143
Oh, the camera loves me.

07:00.649 --> 07:03.016
Oh, good you got the
Red Cross thing in.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.649
Right about now.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.949
Khadijah, in the name
of all that is holy

07:08.016 --> 07:09.683
what have you done to me?

07:11.483 --> 07:14.383
It must've happened at the
printers, I'm sorry, Kyle.

07:14.449 --> 07:17.183
I will print a retraction
in next month's issue.

07:17.249 --> 07:18.883
Next month?

07:18.949 --> 07:21.183
An eternity, Khadijah.

07:21.249 --> 07:23.983
Do you realize what will happen,
when the dozens of women

07:24.049 --> 07:25.516
with whom I've an
exclusive relationship.

07:25.583 --> 07:28.849
Read that I'm married
...with two children.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.849
And one on the way.

07:34.916 --> 07:37.383
I‐I don't know what to say.

07:37.449 --> 07:41.816
I‐I'm without words.
I‐I'm speechless.

07:41.883 --> 07:44.649
I am bereft of utterances.

07:44.716 --> 07:49.516
So Kyle...if that's
your real name.

07:52.283 --> 07:54.849
What's the little lady
cooking for supper, tonight?

07:58.649 --> 07:59.889
[soft music]

08:02.523 --> 08:05.323
We can not just throw people's
right to do process away.

08:05.389 --> 08:07.923
No, I'm sorry but the public
defenders office has been

08:07.989 --> 08:09.356
plea bargaining way to much.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.656
There are lot of attorneys
out there, too concerned

08:11.723 --> 08:13.623
with getting it done. No, no.

08:13.689 --> 08:15.823
See, I'm concerned with
getting done right.

08:15.889 --> 08:19.089
Yes, yes, yes. Finally
someone who agrees with me.

08:19.156 --> 08:21.989
Oh, we can bring a whole
new energy to the office.

08:22.056 --> 08:26.023
Well, we always
did see eye to eye.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.789
Oh‐ho, okay.

08:30.723 --> 08:33.222
You know, I can't believe
that it's been two years

08:33.289 --> 08:35.556
since I mowed you
down at that ski slope.

08:37.123 --> 08:39.356
You do make quite a first
impression, you know?

08:40.589 --> 08:42.556
I thought a lot
about you since then.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.623
[sighs]

08:43.688 --> 08:46.523
Strange how we...lost touch.

08:46.589 --> 08:48.789
Yes. Now look at us.

08:48.856 --> 08:52.589
Practically working on top of
each other. I mean, you know..

08:55.023 --> 08:57.023
Together.

08:57.089 --> 09:00.163
Yeah, but...this
time no ski boots.

09:01.396 --> 09:02.796
No room service.

09:04.829 --> 09:06.829
No zebra skin rug.

09:08.463 --> 09:10.029
No rug burn.

09:12.996 --> 09:15.796
You made thawin' out fun.

09:17.029 --> 09:20.096
And you made gettin'
warm even better.

09:21.596 --> 09:22.729
Waiter.

09:25.263 --> 09:27.129
Check, please.

09:31.929 --> 09:34.163
As you all know, the district
attorney has promised

09:34.229 --> 09:36.929
to eliminate
prostitution in New York.

09:36.996 --> 09:38.429
Again?

09:40.529 --> 09:45.329
Sorry, I'm late. My heel
got stuck in a manhole cover.

09:45.396 --> 09:49.163
And I had to wait for the city
to come out with a crowbar.

09:49.229 --> 09:50.663
Again.

09:52.329 --> 09:54.263
There's no need to apologize.

09:54.329 --> 09:56.896
The important thing
is you're here.

10:01.836 --> 10:04.769
Well, since the DA is going
to pushing for convictions

10:04.836 --> 10:08.069
I'm pleased to say that we're
going to spending time in court.

10:08.136 --> 10:09.969
Now, I've divvy'd
up the case load

10:10.036 --> 10:12.669
and we're working
on these in teams.

10:12.736 --> 10:14.169
Here's the list of assignments.

10:14.236 --> 10:17.036
Fred, you and Shirley.

10:17.103 --> 10:20.036
Max, you'll be working with me.

10:20.103 --> 10:23.069
Ah, sir? Not that I mind
in the least working

10:23.136 --> 10:26.469
with my esteemed
colleague, Mrs. Catsun Baum.

10:29.669 --> 10:33.203
But was there any particular
strategy or technique

10:33.269 --> 10:36.236
you used to decide who
would be working with whom?

10:36.303 --> 10:40.169
‐ I'm just curious.
‐ Nope, random.

10:40.236 --> 10:42.403
Random. Okay, good. Thank you.

10:44.236 --> 10:48.103
Well, if there are no further
questions. Let's get to it.

11:00.343 --> 11:02.576
I feel like I'm wearing
a sign that says

11:02.643 --> 11:04.443
"Just slept with co‐worker."

11:04.509 --> 11:06.376
At least your pantyhose
aren't on backwards.

11:07.743 --> 11:10.109
I got dressed in record
time this morning.

11:10.176 --> 11:13.609
‐ Yeah, but you look perfect.
‐ Thank you, so do you.

11:15.343 --> 11:18.076
Oh, Max. We're in some pretty
dangerous territory here.

11:18.143 --> 11:21.776
I know, I know. Office romance
is almost always failed.

11:21.843 --> 11:24.843
And if doesn't work out, we
still gonna have to work here.

11:24.909 --> 11:28.243
This is a no win situation. We
must stop before it gets deep.

11:28.309 --> 11:31.576
There you go. And in a few weeks
we'll look back on this

11:31.643 --> 11:33.909
and think, "Hey, we
made the right choice."

11:33.976 --> 11:37.076
I'm feelin' it already. No
offence but you're not all that.

11:39.109 --> 11:41.043
‐ Thank you.
‐ Yes.

11:41.109 --> 11:42.409
Come here, baby.

11:48.576 --> 11:52.076
Ah, I think, we're both
mature enough to handle this.

11:53.009 --> 11:54.476
Hmm. Most definitely.

11:55.609 --> 11:57.043
[knock on door]

11:57.109 --> 12:00.683
(Fred)
'Mr. August, uh, did
I leave my day runner in there?'

12:07.416 --> 12:08.916
Well, Khadijah.

12:08.983 --> 12:11.383
Thanks to you and
your yellow journalism

12:11.449 --> 12:13.983
everybody thinks
that I am married.

12:14.049 --> 12:16.949
I can not buy a date
in this town, girl.

12:17.016 --> 12:20.283
For $40, Synclaire
and I will go out with you.

12:22.416 --> 12:25.683
But if you don't call us
the next day, we'll be so hurt.

12:27.449 --> 12:29.683
Look, Kyle, if you're having
problems with these women

12:29.749 --> 12:31.983
I will talk to them
and set them straight.

12:32.049 --> 12:34.016
I was hoping, you'd
say that. LaDonna Martin

12:34.083 --> 12:37.583
a woman of great beauty
and short‐temper is on hold.

12:41.049 --> 12:44.383
Hi, this is Khadijah James,
publisher of 'Flavor'.

12:44.449 --> 12:47.183
I just wanted to set you
straight on this whole thing

12:47.249 --> 12:50.716
Kyle is not married,
he's very single.

12:50.783 --> 12:52.949
Who are you calling a liar?

12:53.016 --> 12:56.416
Let me somethin', Kyle has
more women than you can count.

12:56.483 --> 12:59.489
He don't need you.
That's right.

13:02.523 --> 13:05.823
With LaDonna taken care of,
who else you need me to talk to?

13:08.056 --> 13:09.456
This is unbelievable.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.156
I mean, Kyle Barker
without a woman.

13:13.756 --> 13:15.423
It's apocalypse now.

13:16.889 --> 13:19.423
Oh, cheer up, shorty.
You've had droughts before.

13:19.489 --> 13:23.756
No, no, no. Correction. I have
taken a dating hiatus before.

13:23.823 --> 13:26.189
This‐this is uncharted
territory, I don't know.

13:27.656 --> 13:30.656
Then, let me suggest that
you curl up with a good book.

13:30.723 --> 13:34.089
I recommend C. J. Rollins',
Tools, Power Tools

13:34.156 --> 13:37.256
and Battery Operated Mechanisms.

13:37.323 --> 13:40.789
Look here, I dare you, I dare
you to read the chapter on

13:40.856 --> 13:43.589
"The rise of the
mighty Phillips Head."

13:45.956 --> 13:48.056
And not be moved.

13:52.089 --> 13:55.989
Well, Kyle, as it so
happens, I'm free tonight.

13:56.056 --> 13:57.523
Take me to the Rainbow Room

13:57.589 --> 14:00.929
and I'll help you
keep up appearances.

14:00.996 --> 14:04.063
Oh, this is truly a
low point in my social life.

14:05.729 --> 14:08.163
A platonic dinner.

14:08.229 --> 14:10.063
Well, go, go, get dressed. Go.

14:11.929 --> 14:13.896
Now, let's see what to wear.

14:13.963 --> 14:17.963
I need something that says,
"I'm with him but it's a favor."

14:21.096 --> 14:23.596
Hey, Kyle, shouldn't you
be at home with the wife

14:23.663 --> 14:25.196
practicing Lamaze?

14:26.863 --> 14:30.863
Hey, Maxine, shouldn't you be at
home cooking Hansel and Gretel?

14:30.929 --> 14:33.296
Tell Regine I'll be
back in an hour.

14:33.363 --> 14:36.529
Hey, girl. What's up? I ain't
seen you for a few days.

14:36.596 --> 14:39.429
Well, you know the life of
a public defender, work, work.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.296
Yes. How is Preston?

14:43.263 --> 14:44.596
The best.

14:44.663 --> 14:49.163
I see him at work, I seen him
after work, I've seen him later.

14:49.229 --> 14:50.996
This is gettin' deep for you.

14:51.063 --> 14:52.963
Dare we use the "L" word?

14:53.029 --> 14:56.029
Absolutely. I really like him.

14:59.096 --> 15:00.769
Oh, Max, you're so lucky.

15:00.836 --> 15:03.836
I would love to have Obie
with me at work at Flavor.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.303
You already spend half your time
talking to him on the phone.

15:07.369 --> 15:11.769
Yeah, but then I wouldn't get
that nasty rash in my ear.

15:11.836 --> 15:16.069
Oh, that's real sweet,
my little fruity pebble.

15:16.136 --> 15:17.869
But I got a strict
policy against

15:17.936 --> 15:19.736
mixing business with pleasure.

15:19.803 --> 15:21.803
Have we learnt nothing
from the tragic saga

15:21.869 --> 15:23.669
of Tom Roseanne Arnold.

15:25.803 --> 15:28.569
Well, maybe, working together
is a problem for others.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.703
But Preston and
I are professionals.

15:31.769 --> 15:34.036
Isn't this cute?

15:34.103 --> 15:36.669
Preston won this for
me today at Coney Island.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.136
But you hate Coney Island.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.769
Isn't that funny?

15:41.503 --> 15:44.403
Preston hates it too
but we had a great time.

15:44.469 --> 15:46.769
Look, not that I don't
trust your judgment but..

15:46.836 --> 15:48.869
...do you know what
the hell you doin'?

15:48.936 --> 15:51.736
Khadijah, I've got
it all under control.

15:51.803 --> 15:54.536
I can have a man
and I can have my work.

15:54.603 --> 15:56.836
And I can have my
man and my work.

15:58.536 --> 16:00.276
What is all that?

16:00.343 --> 16:02.843
Alright. Today I had
a little bit too much man

16:02.909 --> 16:04.709
and not enough work.

16:07.543 --> 16:09.504
Hey, Khadijah, Khadijah.

16:09.571 --> 16:12.837
I have changed my mind, I do not want
you to print that retraction.

16:12.904 --> 16:15.604
Man, I can't believe,
you'd stoop this low.

16:15.671 --> 16:17.437
What are you up to, Kyle?

16:17.504 --> 16:19.771
Because of your
libelous remarks

16:19.837 --> 16:22.537
I've reached dating heights
even I never dreamed of.

16:22.604 --> 16:25.104
I'm tellin' you, I've become
a magnet for those women

16:25.171 --> 16:29.104
who that non‐committed
feel of a married man.

16:29.171 --> 16:32.504
You are going to burn, Kyle.

16:32.571 --> 16:38.104
Khadijah, there are a lot of
very troubled women out there.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.471
And some of them
very beautiful.

16:40.537 --> 16:44.004
For three dollars a minute,
they'll love you all you want.

16:46.304 --> 16:48.537
I can't believe, you're goin'
take advantage like this.

16:48.604 --> 16:51.904
Wait, it is they who
are taking advantage.

16:51.971 --> 16:54.137
I am a married man.

16:54.204 --> 16:55.804
[phone ringing]

16:55.871 --> 16:57.537
Oh, there's
a needy one now.

16:58.437 --> 16:59.737
I feel so used.

17:02.677 --> 17:03.977
Hello?

17:04.044 --> 17:06.777
Sharon, I told you never
to call me on this line.

17:06.844 --> 17:08.810
Suppose my wife would've
picked it up, huh?

17:08.877 --> 17:11.310
You know, Vanelle is
not a stupid woman.

17:11.377 --> 17:14.144
Yes. I'll call you
later. Bye‐bye.

17:14.211 --> 17:15.711
[giggling]

17:17.277 --> 17:21.444
You know, shorty, I hope Vanelle
gets half of everything you got.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.277
This tastes better
than the usual stuff.

17:27.344 --> 17:29.144
Yeah, it's Preston's
special blend.

17:29.211 --> 17:30.744
‐ Oh.
‐ I wonder what's in it.

17:30.811 --> 17:32.911
Kenyan rose and
Jamaican blue mountain.

17:35.877 --> 17:38.077
I know my third world coffees.
Ha‐ha.

17:42.444 --> 17:43.677
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

17:43.744 --> 17:45.844
He can grind
my coffee beans anytime.

17:47.677 --> 17:52.077
He's handsome and single.
I wonder if has a girlfriend.

17:52.144 --> 17:54.877
Oh, I hear he has a
very jealous girlfriend.

17:54.944 --> 17:57.677
That, "waits for you to
come out of your house so

17:57.744 --> 18:00.484
she can run you down with
your car" kind of girlfriend.

18:00.551 --> 18:02.017
Oh, I wonder if she knows

18:02.084 --> 18:04.817
that his assistant is in
there with him all the time.

18:04.884 --> 18:05.917
Just taking..

18:05.984 --> 18:07.484
(together)
Dictation.

18:11.451 --> 18:14.084
And with the recent cuts
in federal funding I‐‐

18:14.151 --> 18:15.717
I have to talk to you.

18:15.784 --> 18:17.784
Gail, would you excuse us?

18:17.851 --> 18:19.617
Well, certainly.

18:19.684 --> 18:22.351
I will just get a cup
of your delicious coffee.

18:24.284 --> 18:25.651
Open or close?

18:30.284 --> 18:31.517
What is it, Maxine?

18:31.584 --> 18:35.784
Well, for starters, she spends
way too much time in here.

18:35.851 --> 18:37.151
She's my secretary.

18:37.217 --> 18:41.017
Oh, and how convenient
that she's a woman. Ho‐ho.

18:41.084 --> 18:43.451
I cannot believe
that you're jealous.

18:43.517 --> 18:46.251
You're the one with all
the men buzzin' around you.

18:46.317 --> 18:48.384
Fred Meyer.

18:48.451 --> 18:51.051
Fred Meyer is a dork.

18:51.117 --> 18:54.817
So? I saw the way he was
checkin' you out in that suit.

18:54.884 --> 19:00.017
And if he wasn't lookin',
he was thinkin' about lookin'

19:00.084 --> 19:02.291
That's ridiculous.

19:02.357 --> 19:06.157
So is the notion that I have
any interest in my assistant.

19:06.224 --> 19:09.057
Oh, please. She did not
start wearing that wonderbra

19:09.124 --> 19:12.157
until you came along.

19:12.224 --> 19:15.057
Well, you see, that's because
I felt that her cleavage

19:15.124 --> 19:19.157
wasn't pronounced enough.
So I suggested she go buy one.

19:19.224 --> 19:22.591
In fact, I went with
her to buy it.

19:22.657 --> 19:24.957
In fact, we went to
pick it out together

19:25.024 --> 19:27.657
walking hand in hand
through Bra World.

19:31.591 --> 19:34.324
And why did you have to bring
your special coffee beans

19:34.391 --> 19:36.691
in here, gettin'
the women all worked up?

19:36.757 --> 19:39.457
Vonwel Diaz never got
so much attention.

19:43.457 --> 19:46.857
Well, I feel like
an idiot, how about you?

19:46.924 --> 19:49.391
Yeah.

19:49.457 --> 19:51.157
Truth is..

19:51.224 --> 19:55.657
...I find it really difficult
being your lover and your boss.

19:55.724 --> 19:59.257
I mean...I've seen
you in a G‐string.

20:00.997 --> 20:03.631
Frankly, I'm seein' you
in that G‐string...now.

20:05.764 --> 20:07.497
How do I look?
Oh, nevermind.

20:08.997 --> 20:11.297
Ah, honestly, I can't
concentrate either.

20:11.364 --> 20:13.864
This morning when the judge
called us in to chambers

20:13.931 --> 20:16.064
I didn't hear a single word.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.264
Doggone!

20:18.331 --> 20:20.431
This is not going
to work, is it?

20:21.931 --> 20:25.031
I don't see how.

20:25.097 --> 20:27.097
Well, maybe, you can
get another job.

20:29.197 --> 20:31.697
Maxine, I just got here.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.731
Well, I can't move on. I had
to get arrested to get this gig.

20:35.797 --> 20:38.064
I don't want either
one of us to leave.

20:39.797 --> 20:42.297
Well, then I guess
we don't have any options.

20:46.831 --> 20:49.164
It's too bad we can't
ski for a living.

20:51.731 --> 20:53.631
We'll always have
warming hut three.

20:54.931 --> 20:57.131
In that perfect
mid‐night sleigh ride.

20:59.764 --> 21:02.504
You know, if we're goin'
make a clean break of this

21:02.571 --> 21:04.537
I'm really going to
have to hate you.

21:06.404 --> 21:07.604
Okay.

21:07.671 --> 21:08.971
I'll partner you with Fred.

21:10.471 --> 21:13.004
That helps.

21:13.071 --> 21:16.171
And I want these cases
checked, prepped and on my desk

21:16.237 --> 21:18.604
first thing in the
morning, 8 a. m. sharp.

21:18.671 --> 21:20.704
You know, you are
becoming a real jerk.

21:23.137 --> 21:24.604
And I appreciate it.

21:46.304 --> 21:49.171
Hi. My name is Kyle Barker.

21:49.237 --> 21:51.204
Can I buy you a drink?

21:51.271 --> 21:52.437
Oh, this?

21:52.504 --> 21:55.237
Yes, it is a wedding ring
and yes, I am married.

21:55.304 --> 21:57.137
But can we not talk about it.

21:57.204 --> 21:59.671
My wife's a very troubled woman.

21:59.737 --> 22:02.244
You know, if it hadn't
been for little Joey

22:02.311 --> 22:04.244
we would've divorced
a long time ago.

22:04.311 --> 22:07.244
God, that kid means
everything to me.

22:07.311 --> 22:09.177
If there was just
some safe harbor

22:09.244 --> 22:11.211
from this storm
of loneliness I..

22:11.277 --> 22:14.411
You know, a man has needs and..

22:14.477 --> 22:16.144
So, how about that drink, huh?
