WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:02.460
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.500 --> 00:03.489
(muffled screaming)

00:05.530 --> 00:07.088
Something's wrong?
We need to talk.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.334
I told her... told
her what you were,

00:12.380 --> 00:13.631
but she wouldn't listen.
Sherlock.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.636
To allow a criminal syndicate
to set up shop

00:15.680 --> 00:17.705
in your stupid restaurant.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.069
SHERLOCK:
So, you said you struck
some sort of "deal" with them.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.644
Explain it to me.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.217
We're doing our best,
considering the circumstances.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.081
BRITISH MAN: Circumstances that
could have been avoided

00:25.120 --> 00:26.712
if you'd removed your brother
from New York,

00:26.760 --> 00:28.409
as I recommended
a few months ago.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.587
You must realize that as_soon as
we hand over the list,

00:30.630 --> 00:32.791
they will murder you,
me and Joan.

00:32.830 --> 00:36.618
Let's approach the situation
the smart way.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.658
(Taser clicking)

00:39.700 --> 00:43.261
You have
what we asked for?

00:43.310 --> 00:45.403
Kill them.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.575
(gunfire)

00:49.610 --> 00:51.544
(tires screeching)

00:51.580 --> 00:52.547
MAN (British accent):
It's all clear.

00:52.580 --> 00:53.569
You squared, sir?

00:56.790 --> 00:59.315
Obviously, there's a great deal
I need to tell you.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.683
*

01:12.800 --> 01:14.563
BELL:
Holmes.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.807
You okay?

01:16.840 --> 01:18.705
No. Something's happened.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.776
I need the captain's help.
Yours as well.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.744
(phone ringing)

01:26.520 --> 01:28.249
Watson?

01:28.280 --> 01:29.679
WATSON:
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.813
Look, we're really busy
right now,

01:31.850 --> 01:33.681
but if you need me, grab me.
All right?

01:33.720 --> 01:35.711
Where are you?

01:35.760 --> 01:36.784
Home.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.582
Mycroft's here, too.

01:38.630 --> 01:41.519
There's a lot you need to know.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.270
It's okay.

01:52.310 --> 01:54.301
It's all right.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.142
I'm all right.

02:01.180 --> 02:03.614
My brother?

02:03.650 --> 02:05.311
Here.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.326
All things considered,
you're doing quite well.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.920
I can give you something
to help you sleep, if you like.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.167
Oh, that's okay.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.768
Give me one reason
I shouldn't thrash you.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.665
You're upset, and you're right
to be, but I can explain.

02:25.710 --> 02:26.802
Actually,
I've heard this before;

02:26.840 --> 02:28.205
I don't need to hear it again.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.798
I'm going to bed.
Excuse me.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.208
Expat physician.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.218
Two guards both carrying
Glock 17s

02:37.250 --> 02:38.945
and wearing
bulletproof jackets.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.912
British Intelligence? MI6?

02:40.960 --> 02:43.884
Obviously, you struck
some sort of deal with them.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.818
Copping to your various
criminal activities

02:45.860 --> 02:47.657
in exchange for help
with rescuing Watson.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.794
Gentlemen, please know
you have my deepest gratitude

02:50.830 --> 02:52.866
for bringing my partner home
in one piece.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.788
As for my brother,

02:54.840 --> 02:57.331
I can only hope that
whatever deal he struck with you

02:57.370 --> 02:58.860
involves some form of jail time.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.832
Are you quite finished?

03:00.880 --> 03:02.768
No, not even close.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.607
Then I'll do you the favor
of telling you you're wrong.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.574
British Intelligence
isn't here to arrest me.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.215
I am British Intelligence.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.815
Everything I've told you
is true, more or less.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.352
I've just omitted a great deal.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.494
It's true, my business
was going through a rough patch.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.998
I needed cash to keep
my restaurants afloat.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.895
So, you took money
from drug dealers.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.739
What could go wrong?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.328
Le Milieu approached me
with what they called

04:01.370 --> 04:03.304
a "mutually beneficial
arrangement."

04:03.340 --> 04:04.932
It was not an offer
one could decline,

04:04.970 --> 04:08.303
and yet that's precisely
what I intended to do.

04:08.340 --> 04:10.376
But, before I could
give my official word,

04:10.410 --> 04:12.571
I was visited
by a man from M16.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.784
He told me they'd been
watching Le Milieu

04:16.820 --> 04:19.357
and were aware of the offer
he urged me to accept.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.756
Burrow in,
keep my eyes and ears open,

04:21.790 --> 04:24.452
do some good
for Queen and country.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.855
And here was me
thinking MI6

04:25.890 --> 04:28.495
was an intelligence
organization.

04:28.530 --> 04:31.499
But they sought help from you,
a virtual cartoon character.

04:31.530 --> 04:32.997
You're not listening.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.837
Would you put that down
before you kill us both?

04:34.870 --> 04:36.508
That is toxic mold.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.007
Part of an experiment.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.406
Inhaling it would be
a death sentence.

04:46.650 --> 04:47.969
(water running)

04:48.020 --> 04:49.988
I suppose, at first,
it was all very romantic.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.681
I was an asset.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.780
I was embedded with Le Milieu.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.356
As it turned out,

04:56.390 --> 04:58.324
I had something of a knack
for spying.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.827
What's your
Double 0 designation,

04:59.860 --> 05:02.363
license to kill or just annoy?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.925
I never was an operative.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.938
Never went on missions.

05:06.970 --> 05:09.359
But I did find
that I had a capacity

05:09.410 --> 05:12.868
for storing facts--
quite a remarkable one.

05:12.910 --> 05:15.572
And as my work with Le Milieu
brought me into contact

05:15.610 --> 05:17.498
_ _ with other _
criminal organizations,

05:17.550 --> 05:20.439
I began to take on
their secrets, too.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.440
I became a sort of...
clearing house for MI6.

05:25.490 --> 05:28.709
I could often, but not always,
predict the effect

05:28.760 --> 05:31.479
of certain actions
that might be taken

05:31.530 --> 05:33.395
to dismantle criminal groups.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.464
I know you don't
take me seriously,

05:36.500 --> 05:37.819
but the agency does.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.464
And they have done
for quite some time.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.639
So, you honestly
expect me to believe

05:42.670 --> 05:44.501
that you are an M16 asset

05:44.540 --> 05:47.509
and you have
kept that hidden from me...

05:47.540 --> 05:49.542
for over a decade?

05:49.580 --> 05:51.502
Right.

05:51.550 --> 05:52.847
'Cause we're so close.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.687
Few months ago, you told me

05:59.720 --> 06:01.608
that Father wanted me
to return to London.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.059
That was a lie, wasn't it?

06:03.090 --> 06:05.456
You wanted me out of New York,

06:05.490 --> 06:07.094
_ so I wouldn't _
tip to your operation.

06:08.630 --> 06:09.892
He has a handler.

06:09.930 --> 06:11.818
There's a certain...

06:11.870 --> 06:13.394
awareness of you at MI6.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.839
He thought you might interfere.

06:14.870 --> 06:19.534
Your obfuscation _
nearly cost Watson her life.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.400
It was you who became suspicious

06:21.440 --> 06:23.579
of the Le Milieu presence
at Diogenes.

06:23.610 --> 06:25.601
And instead of coming to me,
you went to her,

06:25.650 --> 06:26.947
hoping to drive a wedge.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.447
You want to point fingers,
Sherlock,

06:28.480 --> 06:29.845
save them for yourself.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.108
You could have told me the truth
after she was taken.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.789
I had an obligation to at least
try and maintain my cover.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.823
I also had a plan in place
to guarantee her safe return.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.055
I'm sorry I had to
incapacitate you,

06:40.100 --> 06:42.591
but I couldn't risk the NSA
mucking it up!

06:42.630 --> 06:44.518
(sighs)

06:48.170 --> 06:51.662
This is gonna take some time
to process.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.470
My handler wants to
see us tomorrow, both of us.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.984
Make sure
we're on the same page.

07:05.020 --> 07:08.581
It's the sort of invitation
one is obliged to accept.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.181
Sort of a running
theme with you.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.425
Look forward to it.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.145
Ah, the Holmes boys.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.015
You must be "the handler,"

07:38.050 --> 07:39.608
Sherrington.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.480
Overthrow any good
governments lately?

07:44.290 --> 07:46.850
This is a place my colleagues
and I like to gather.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.925
The clientele
tend to be misanthropic.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.019
Everyone... keeps to himself.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.129
So, forgive me if I skip
the obligatory chit-chat.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.536
I've got a traumatized friend
I'd like to get home to.

07:55.570 --> 07:57.231
What do you say
we cut to the chase?

07:57.270 --> 07:58.806
"The chase"?

07:58.840 --> 08:01.138
How is MI6 handling
last night's cock-up

08:01.180 --> 08:03.239
and to what lies shall
Watson and I adhere to

08:03.280 --> 08:05.703
_ in the event that we are
interVIewed by other parties?

08:05.750 --> 08:07.012
(chuckles)

08:07.050 --> 08:08.278
Everything you said he was, eh?

08:08.320 --> 08:11.187
Oh, you're only
scratching the surface.

08:11.220 --> 08:14.610
Mycroft said three Le Milieu
soldiers were killed last night.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.548
My men cleaned the scene;
the bodies won't turn up.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.251
And de Soto, the captain?

08:18.290 --> 08:19.723
Should we be looking
over our shoulders for

08:19.760 --> 08:21.125
angry Frenchmen
for the rest of our lives?

08:21.160 --> 08:24.129
Uh, de Soto was
picked up leaving the scene

08:24.170 --> 08:27.867
and in possession of a list
of stolen Swiss bank accounts.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.835
We made sure that his lot found
out enough about it to, uh,

08:30.870 --> 08:32.804
motivate him to cooperate.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.137
They think
he disappeared his men

08:34.180 --> 08:37.047
and then made off with the list.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.071
My involvement and Mycroft's
will remain a secret?

08:40.920 --> 08:42.114
(sighs):
Hmm.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.981
Well, Watson and I
can keep that straight.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.112
Let's you and I
never cross paths again.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.549
Brother.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.627
I have a job for you,
Sherlock.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.998
A case,
I think you'd call it.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.759
A case? What case?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.222
I did you a favor last night.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.329
I saved your partner's life.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.258
You did and I'm grateful.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.165
Saved your brother's life, too.
I'll let that slide.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.760
Ten minutes.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.129
That's all I ask.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.274
SHERRINGTON: Last week,
an ex-analyst of ours

09:11.310 --> 09:13.016
was found murdered
in his apartment.

09:13.050 --> 09:15.644
Man by the name of
Arthur West.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.648
Police think it was a...

09:17.690 --> 09:19.578
a robbery gone wrong.

09:19.620 --> 09:22.088
But you suspect otherwise?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.929
Honestly, I can't say.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.258
Things with West
always were complicated.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.798
You don't look well, Mycroft.

09:29.830 --> 09:33.937
I was told this would be
a simple debriefing.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.938
It was. _Now it's
something else.

09:35.970 --> 09:39.872
Consider how Joan might feel
if you take a case with MI6

09:39.910 --> 09:42.276
after everything that
happened last night.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.141
Judging by the cold shoulder
I saw you receive,

09:44.180 --> 09:46.307
I'd say she was no longer
any of your concern.

09:46.350 --> 09:48.716
Besides, I'm not planning
to lie to her about it

09:48.750 --> 09:50.286
whilst taking her into my bed.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.811
So, it's hardly
the same thing, is it?

09:54.090 --> 09:56.627
You were saying:
Arthur West, complicated.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.220
SHERRINGTON: Well, at one time,
he was a valued resource.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.229
Kind of man_ who could
spot patterns in the chatter

10:02.260 --> 10:04.194
between suspicious parties.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.336
Patterns that could raise
flags, save lives.

10:07.370 --> 10:09.190
But his periods of high value

10:09.240 --> 10:12.129
were interspersed with phases
of no activity at all.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.638
I see references here
to anti-depressants,

10:14.680 --> 10:17.046
mood stabilizers. Bipolar?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.810
Eventually, he was seeing
shadows where none existed.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.772
Forced him into
early retirement.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.980
What was he doing in New York?

10:26.020 --> 10:28.682
Well, settled here
after he washed out.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.187
Wife's an American.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.222
Should say ex-wife; they
split up two years ago.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.296
But every now and again,
even as a civilian,

10:35.330 --> 10:37.821
West would contact us
and say he had something.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.064
First few times,
we followed through,

10:39.100 --> 10:40.294
but when they led
to nothing...

10:40.340 --> 10:42.194
You lost his number.

10:42.240 --> 10:46.199
He didn't contact us
for a good long while.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.776
Until two weeks ago.

10:47.810 --> 10:50.347
Insisted that the information
he had was crucial

10:50.380 --> 10:52.769
to the preservation
of the agency.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.708
Refused to talk about
it on the phone.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.741
Wanted a face-to-face.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.382
No one took him seriously.

10:58.420 --> 10:59.956
Until he was killed.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.027
The case is now in
the hands of the NYPD.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.359
Look, I'd like you to take a
peak into the investigation.

11:06.390 --> 11:08.255
See if anything jumps out.

11:10.730 --> 11:14.291
_If West's murder is as
it appears, well, lovely.

11:16.370 --> 11:19.203
If it's more than that...

11:19.240 --> 11:21.105
you'll let us know.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.370
And we'll take
it from there.

11:23.410 --> 11:26.277
That's it?

11:26.310 --> 11:28.870
I'd also like you to assassinate
the Premier of China.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.717
Perhaps I should have
led with that.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.778
Take a look at the case.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.378
Give us your two cents worth,

11:35.420 --> 11:38.480
and then we'll consider
our score settled.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.054
MYCROFI':
You do know my brother

11:40.100 --> 11:42.159
is the very opposite
of a company man?

11:43.930 --> 11:46.728
Expecting him to abide by
your limitations is a folly.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.169
Worried I'll show you up?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.168
More worried you'll start a war.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.306
Your conditions are acceptable.

11:54.410 --> 11:55.900
I'll be in touch.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.281
(door opens, closes)

12:10.460 --> 12:11.825
Hey.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.748
How you feeling?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.963
About the same.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.366
I was trying to see if anything
that happened last night

12:19.400 --> 12:21.391
made it to the news,
but so far, it's...

12:21.440 --> 12:23.135
It's one of the benefits of

12:23.170 --> 12:24.364
being a clandestine
intelligence organization.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.435
They excel at
sweeping things

12:26.470 --> 12:28.233
under the rug.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.838
Is Ms. Hudson gone?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.871
Yeah. I wasn't
feeling like company.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.170
(sighs)

12:37.420 --> 12:41.015
I want you to know that, uh...
I'm sorry.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.119
For everything
you've been through

12:43.160 --> 12:46.482
and, uh... whatever part
I might have played in it.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.267
If-if anything
ever happened to you...

12:50.300 --> 12:51.858
What was that meeting
you had to go to?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.901
I've been assigned to
an investigative task by MI6.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.332
In exchange for
their assistance last night.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.940
Once completed,
they and my brother

13:03.980 --> 13:05.948
will be out of
our lives forever.

13:05.980 --> 13:09.143
What do they want us to do?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.115
Let me be very clear
on something:

13:13.160 --> 13:15.458
you're welcome to assist me,
but I have

13:15.490 --> 13:17.526
no expectation of that.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.449
You should take whatever time
that you need to... recuperate.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.354
Actually, work would be
good right now.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.459
_ I don't want to
Sit around anymore.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.559
So, what's the task?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.465
Arthur Cadogan West.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.936
Found dead in his Greenpoint
apartment four nights ago,

13:31.970 --> 13:35.371
two gunshots
to the chest.

13:35.410 --> 13:38.277
Drawer F3.

13:38.310 --> 13:39.379
Knock yourselves out.

13:39.410 --> 13:42.413
Thank you.

13:42.450 --> 13:46.284
According to this, West
walked in on a burglary.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.414
Murder weapon
was never recovered.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.329
Dr. Hawes.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.497
Was Mr. West intact
when he arrived?

13:59.530 --> 14:01.066
What do you mean "intact"?

14:01.100 --> 14:02.567
In possession
of his extremities.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.534
Course he was. Why?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.978
Not your work, I take it?

14:11.010 --> 14:12.443
No.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.313
No one who works here
would have... done that.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.489
Well, let's assume it
was the work of someone

14:17.520 --> 14:19.317
who do not work here.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.386
I think you've been
the victim of a break-in.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.228
Why were you two
even looking at this guy?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.919
Bored.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.562
Came here in search
of an interesting case.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.090
As we are wont to do.

14:35.140 --> 14:38.029
Well, nobody noticed
till now, but there is

14:38.070 --> 14:39.606
an hour-long gap
in the surveillance video

14:39.640 --> 14:41.107
from three nights ago.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.948
how to shut down
the system

14:43.980 --> 14:45.174
and when to make their move.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.973
The morgue's been shorthanded;

14:47.020 --> 14:50.046
the assistant M.E. on call_was
out at a scene half that night.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.115
We got to at least consider
the possibility

14:52.150 --> 14:53.378
this was an inside job.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.615
Hmm. You guys got
nothing, right?

14:55.660 --> 14:58.322
No. I'd be remiss
if I didn't express my doubts

14:58.360 --> 14:59.622
this was a member of staff.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.457
I spend a good deal
of time here.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.058
I've got a nose for traitors.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.260
(phone ringing)

15:04.300 --> 15:06.097
The chief.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.939
I'll tell him
about your nose.

15:07.970 --> 15:08.937
Hello.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.575
Couldn't have
told him the truth?

15:17.610 --> 15:19.703
That we were drawn into a
web of intrigue and deceit

15:19.750 --> 15:22.412
by my ne'er-do-well
brother/MI6 asset?

15:22.450 --> 15:25.339
No. Not without compromising
his cover as a clueless idiot.

15:25.390 --> 15:26.982
You meant what you said
about the arms

15:27.020 --> 15:28.351
not being taken
by someone who works here.

15:28.390 --> 15:31.359
Given Mr. Wes_t's
former occupation

15:31.390 --> 15:34.393
and the infiltration skills
demonstrated by his limb-thief,

15:34.430 --> 15:37.024
this is in all likelihood the
work of a field operative.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.368
I think Mycroft's associate
is right to think that

15:39.400 --> 15:41.698
there is more to Mr. West's
murder than meets the eye.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.528
I don't understand why
anyone would want to steal

15:46.570 --> 15:48.538
a dead man's arms-- spy or not.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.207
I assume it's for
one of two reasons:

15:50.250 --> 15:52.104
_either to retrieve _
eVIdence or destroy it.

15:52.150 --> 15:54.539
Okay. Well, according to
Hawes' autopsy report,

15:54.580 --> 15:57.481
there are no indications of
a struggle With the attackers.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.284
There's no defense wounds,
no skin under the nails.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.380
And other than a rather
perva5ive case of eczema,

16:03.430 --> 16:06.388
Mr. West's arms
seem unremarkable.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.421
Well, the crime scene
has been sealed,

16:08.460 --> 16:10.462
so might be worth
taking a look at that.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.320
Agreed.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.395
Let me know
what you find.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.328
Where are you going?

16:16.370 --> 16:18.008
The original
detectives interviewed

16:18.040 --> 16:19.735
Mr_. West's
ex-WIfe, Marion.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.034
She claimed to be out of
touch with the victim.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.469
Have a look
at the address

16:24.510 --> 16:27.377
on the shopping bags
in the kitchen.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.513
He lives in Brooklyn,
she in Murray Hill.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.383
The bags from this market
are from Third Avenue.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.514
So, you think she was doing
the shopping for him.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.425
So, she lied to the police.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.663
W-Why would anybody do that?

16:44.700 --> 16:47.567
Who would want to steal
Arthur's arms?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.534
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.333
But right now,
we're more curious

16:51.370 --> 16:54.407
why you lied to the detectives
who interviewed you.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.546
You claimed that you hadn't seen
Mr. West in months.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.400
We stopped by a supermarket
on the way here.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.077
Young woman
behind the pharmacy counter--

17:01.120 --> 17:03.611
she confirmed that you regularly
filled the prescriptions

17:03.650 --> 17:06.744
used to treat
his bipolar disorder.

17:06.790 --> 17:10.157
Arthur and I
tried to make our marriage work,

17:10.190 --> 17:14.058
even after he got worse, but...

17:14.100 --> 17:15.749
I wasn't strong enough.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.098
I still loved him though.

17:18.130 --> 17:21.634
I still wanted to make sure
that he was all right, but...

17:21.670 --> 17:24.104
I have a boyfriend now.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.539
And he can get jealous.

17:25.570 --> 17:28.403
He didn't know that I was
still taking care of Arthur.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.772
He was here when the police
were questioning me, and...

17:30.810 --> 17:33.472
I figured since I didn't
know anything anyway...

17:33.520 --> 17:35.272
(sighs)

17:35.320 --> 17:37.515
...I-I lied.

17:37.550 --> 17:40.087
Now, when you say your
boyfriend could get jealous--

17:40.120 --> 17:41.758
jealous enough
to commit murder?

17:41.790 --> 17:44.452
We spent the weekend
in a B&B up in New Paltz.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.822
I still have all the receipts.

17:46.860 --> 17:50.523
Neither one of us was in town
when Arthur was killed.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.130
Are you the tattoo artist
or is your boyfriend?

17:53.170 --> 17:55.798
Oh, uh, I am.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.263
Oh, yeah? Any good?
Got a few myself.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.369
Oh.
(chuckles)

18:00.410 --> 18:01.775
I don't get many complaints.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.574
Not an interest shared
by your ex-husband though?

18:04.610 --> 18:06.077
No?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.583
Oh, well.
Not for everyone, I suppose.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.589
(phone ringing)

18:16.620 --> 18:17.587
Hey.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.427
You still at West's apartment?

18:19.460 --> 18:21.121
Yes. Why?

18:21.160 --> 18:22.650
Photograph of his kitchen.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.565
I noticed a roll of
plastic food wrap.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.659
Doesn't look like he does
much cooking there though.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.133
I want you to look and check,

18:28.170 --> 18:29.637
see if there are
any other items there.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.706
Moisturizing ointment,

18:31.740 --> 18:34.800
medical tape
or antibacterial soap.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.741
Why? What are you thinking?

18:40.780 --> 18:42.748
All of those items,
food wrap included,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.919
are products used
in the aftercare of a tattoo.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.611
Marion West was a tattoo artist.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.756
I believe she inked
her ex-husband's arms.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.621
Except that West
did not have tattoos;

18:51.660 --> 18:52.786
we saw the pictures.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.593
Just because
we couldn't see them,

18:54.630 --> 18:55.858
doesn't mean
they weren't there.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.926
Ta_ttoos can be created
usmg UV sen5itive ink.

18:58.970 --> 19:02.462
Which means, they can
only be viewed under a UV light.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.604
I think the dry skin
we saw on West's arms

19:04.640 --> 19:06.631
_ were tattoos _
in the process of healing.

19:06.670 --> 19:08.706
Invisible ink tattoos?

19:08.740 --> 19:10.947
Not only real,
but they're quite popular

19:10.980 --> 19:12.641
in certain subcultures.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.740
Right up there with glow sticks
and adult-sized pacifiers.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.180
I don't suppose you confirmed
any of this with Marion West?

19:18.220 --> 19:20.211
Well, not surprisingly,
she chose to evade.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.785
I did notice a black light
amongst her equipment,

19:22.820 --> 19:26.256
but beyond that, we'll have
to look elsewhere for our proof.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.554
If I'm right, our former analyst

19:28.600 --> 19:30.966
inscribed secrets onto his arms
in inVISIble ink,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.794
dismembered him in order to
obtain those secrets.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.967
You_ know how _insane
this sounds, right?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.899
I remind you, you've entered
the world of spydom.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.669
Strangeness abounds.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.200
I'm off to see
Mycroft's handler.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.571
Okay.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.411
Joan.

19:51.450 --> 19:53.509
Sherlock's not here.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.982
I'll tell him
you came by.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.817
Actually,
I came to see you.

19:59.430 --> 20:00.419
No.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.927
No, to what?

20:01.960 --> 20:04.360
No, to whatever
you came here to say.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.822
No, you can't come in.

20:05.870 --> 20:07.292
No, I'm not all right.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.695
No, there is
no possible future for us,

20:09.740 --> 20:11.765
once some time goes by.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.678
Just no.

20:14.710 --> 20:18.407
Joan, I came here to apologize.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.942
_ Because of...
ch0ices I made years ago,

20:21.980 --> 20:24.813
because of my obligation
to maintain secrecy,

20:24.850 --> 20:26.613
you were placed in
terrible danger.

20:26.650 --> 20:31.622
Put through an ordeal no one
should ever have to go through.

20:31.660 --> 20:34.549
If you never want to see me
again, I'd understand.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.921
That's good, because I don't
want to see you again.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.669
And it's not because
I almost got killed.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.807
It's because I cannot believe
a word out of your mouth.

20:47.010 --> 20:50.946
I know that you had your reasons
for everything that you did.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.471
But whatever they were,
you decided a long time ago

20:53.520 --> 20:56.273
that they were much more
important than being honest

20:56.320 --> 20:58.788
with the people
who actually care about you.

20:58.820 --> 21:02.756
Someone who is capable of
that kind of deception...

21:02.790 --> 21:06.419
someone who can maintain it
for literally years...

21:08.430 --> 21:10.762
...I could never
feel comfortable with.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.564
Now, Sherlock may be

21:13.600 --> 21:16.330
insensitive and-and intrusive,

21:16.370 --> 21:17.962
and if anything, too honest,

21:18.010 --> 21:21.377
but with him,
I know exactly where I stand.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.775
He deserves better than you.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.309
So do I.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.451
I understand.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.933
Holmes.

21:52.740 --> 21:55.379
The host didn't tell me
you'd arrived.

21:55.410 --> 21:58.004
I came in a less _orthodox
entrance to see if I could.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.108
I could.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.811
Let me guess,

22:00.850 --> 22:02.579
a_nother asset? _
Where did you plant this one?

22:02.620 --> 22:04.383
Nursing home? Eyebrow barber?

22:04.420 --> 22:06.081
Sherlock Holmes,
meet Sir James Walter,

22:06.120 --> 22:07.018
Deputy Chief SIS.

22:07.050 --> 22:10.486
May I assume you have something
to report?

22:10.530 --> 22:11.781
You're aware of my assignment?

22:11.830 --> 22:13.991
I'm aware of everything.

22:14.030 --> 22:17.522
I believe it's best we take this
to a private room.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.492
I believe West's ki_||ers
removed something

22:19.530 --> 22:21.066
from his apartment
which only later

22:21.100 --> 22:22.988
sparked the discovery
he had tattooed himself.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.065
Thus the need
for the second crime,

22:28.680 --> 22:31.148
And all this from the address
on a shopping bag?

22:31.180 --> 22:33.000
The world is full
of obvious things

22:33.050 --> 22:35.041
which nobody by any chance
ever observes.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.513
Save you.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.040
Save me.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.012
You're old enough to have spied
for Churchill.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.587
The importance of details should
hardly come as a surprise.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.554
SHERRINGTON:
Obviously, we should've

22:44.590 --> 22:46.649
taken West more seriously
when he called us.

22:46.690 --> 22:49.693
He cried wolf too many times,
and the fact that he'd taken

22:49.730 --> 22:51.698
to storing his secrets
on his skin

22:51.730 --> 22:53.766
speaks to the echoes

22:53.800 --> 22:55.836
of an unwell mind.

22:55.870 --> 22:59.033
SHERRINGTON: Any idea
what the tattoos mean?

22:59.070 --> 23:01.072
Not yet.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.974
Oh, you're going
to keep working for us, then?

23:05.010 --> 23:06.602
It's an interesting case.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.675
More so than
I would have expected.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.416
I'm quite pregnant with it now.

23:13.790 --> 23:16.679
(sighs)

23:24.700 --> 23:26.668
WATSON: So, I just
heard from Hawes.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.965
He took a closer look at the
autopsy photos of West's arms.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.662
He does think the dry skin
formed some sort of pattern.

23:32.710 --> 23:34.575
He just can't make out
what it was.

23:34.610 --> 23:36.532
The mystery
of the tattoos persists.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.572
(sighs)

23:42.580 --> 23:43.979
I know what it's like.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.413
To be deceived by a lover.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.555
Irene.

23:49.590 --> 23:50.921
Moriarty.

23:52.690 --> 23:55.488
It's not my favorite topic
of conversation,

23:55.530 --> 23:59.193
but if you thought that
discussing that might help...

24:03.000 --> 24:06.208
Actually, there is something
I want to talk to you about.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.832
It's just not about Mycroft.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.039
Not exactly.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.514
(doorbell ringing)

24:16.620 --> 24:17.644
(ringing continues)

24:24.760 --> 24:26.625
I'm sorry.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.548
Is Sherlock Holmes here?

24:29.630 --> 24:31.222
Mrs. West?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.693
I couldn't talk earlier
in front of the police.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.779
I've been under
surveillance for days,

24:40.810 --> 24:44.075
ever since Arthur was
killed, but I made sure

24:44.110 --> 24:46.249
I wasn't followed here.
So how exactly did you know

24:46.280 --> 24:47.645
wher
e "he ll
re was?

24:47.680 --> 24:48.772
Arthur always told me

24:48.820 --> 24:50.117
if anything ever
happened to him,

24:50.150 --> 24:53.278
you were the one man
in New York I could trust.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.550
That's interesting.
I didn't know your husband.

24:55.590 --> 24:56.784
He knew you.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.026
I'm sorry.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.186
I'll explain everything,

24:59.230 --> 25:01.255
but the reason why I'm here

25:01.300 --> 25:03.723
is I know why someone took
his arms.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.897
They had information on them.

25:05.930 --> 25:07.830
Tattoos you could
only see under...

25:07.870 --> 25:09.269
Under UV light, yes, we know.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.632
What we don't know
is what they depict.

25:11.670 --> 25:12.864
Can you tell us?

25:12.910 --> 25:15.504
I can do better.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.503
I can show you.

25:29.220 --> 25:32.724
MARION_: It was a little
over SIX years ago.

25:32.760 --> 25:33.920
You were still
in London.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.190
You were making waves
at Scotland Yard.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.198
The agency had
taken notice,

25:38.230 --> 25:39.766
and _so Arthur was
aSSIgned to you.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.062
"Assigned"?

25:41.100 --> 25:43.739
He was told to keep
an eye on you.

25:43.770 --> 25:47.809
Nothing invasive,
just collect data.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.068
He was spying on you.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.839
It was more complicated
than that.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.077
Arthur was an analyst,
and there were people

25:54.120 --> 25:55.974
who didn't know
what to make of you.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.783
He assessed you.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.243
Helped make them understand
you were one of the good guys.

26:00.290 --> 26:01.848
Oh, I'm touched.

26:01.890 --> 26:05.883
I know how it sounds,
but he-he liked you,

26:05.930 --> 26:07.750
what you stood for,

26:07.800 --> 26:10.189
and if-if he hadn't done it,
someone else would have.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.323
But you were
a civilian, right?

26:12.370 --> 26:15.259
So why would an analyst at MI6
tell you about his work?

26:15.300 --> 26:17.905
Toward the end,
Arthur knew

26:17.940 --> 26:19.828
that his disease could

26:19.870 --> 26:21.633
steer him wrong
sometimes.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.272
He started
telling me things

26:23.310 --> 26:25.847
to help him prove that his
theories weren't just delusions,

26:25.880 --> 26:27.848
to help keep him sane.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.849
My brother ever come up
in these conversations?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.654
If you're asking me
if Arthur told me he's an asset,

26:33.690 --> 26:34.884
yes, he did.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.911
A little bit of gossip.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.082
If this is MI6's idea
of an analyst,

26:40.130 --> 26:41.927
then the British government
should be falling any day now.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.064
He had a problem,
and he needed someone

26:44.100 --> 26:45.897
to help him.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.795
Tell me that doesn't
sound familiar.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.297
The numbers.

26:50.340 --> 26:51.830
What are they?

26:51.870 --> 26:53.804
Uh, Arthur...

26:53.840 --> 26:56.229
had become convinced
there was a mole

26:56.280 --> 26:58.748
inside MI6,
someone selling secrets

26:58.780 --> 27:00.338
to a spy based
here in New York.

27:00.380 --> 27:03.076
He hadn't managed
to identify the mole, but...

27:03.120 --> 27:04.849
The numbers.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.812
Can you explain them?

27:06.850 --> 27:08.852
No.

27:08.890 --> 27:11.381
He wasn't lucid

27:11.430 --> 27:13.853
the day he came to see me.
He said they were important,

27:13.900 --> 27:15.390
that they would help him

27:15.430 --> 27:17.091
prove that he was right
about the mole.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.119
But nothing else?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.922
No.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.835
So all you did was tattoo
a bunch of numbers

27:21.870 --> 27:23.132
and letters on him?

27:23.170 --> 27:25.809
He said ifI didn't help him,

27:25.840 --> 27:27.831
he would do it himself.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.233
I thought that was worse.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.249
Why would he want them
on him at all?

27:32.280 --> 27:35.010
He said they were
his backup copy.

27:35.050 --> 27:36.779
He had the real proof

27:36.820 --> 27:37.787
someplace else.

27:37.820 --> 27:40.243
He-he was paranoid.

27:40.290 --> 27:43.350
He thought if they were on
his arms, he would have a copy

27:43.390 --> 27:45.278
that no one else
could steal.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.355
Obviously, he was wrong.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.021
This, uh, "spy,"
the man in New York--

27:51.070 --> 27:52.867
did he tell you his name?

27:52.900 --> 27:55.334
Or was that tattooed
on one of his fingers?

27:55.370 --> 27:56.894
Julian Afkhami.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.966
He owns a bookstore
in Queens.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.875
Arthur said he could prove

28:01.910 --> 28:03.946
there was ongoing contact
between him and the mole.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.699
He just needed time
to figure out who it was.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.718
P-Please.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.115
Please.

28:10.150 --> 28:11.947
Whoever came
after Arthur,

28:11.990 --> 28:15.187
I think they're after me.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.950
Can you help me or not?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.467
(sighs)

28:28.500 --> 28:30.388
How is our guest?

28:30.440 --> 28:32.260
I put her
in the spare room upstairs.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.074
I told her we would figure out
our next move in the morning.

28:35.110 --> 28:36.873
So, what'd you make of her?

28:36.910 --> 28:38.741
I think she's
telling the truth.

28:38.780 --> 28:40.304
Or at least she thinks
she's telling the truth.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.238
And if she is, it's
just one more reason

28:42.280 --> 28:44.043
to loathe my brother.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.741
He knew his colleagues were
observing me and said nothing.

28:46.790 --> 28:48.212
(sighs)

28:48.260 --> 28:50.820
"Azatan Books."
It's the store

28:50.860 --> 28:52.953
owned by the man that
Arthur West claimed was a spy.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.150
Julian Afkhami.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.758
Well, it doesn't look
like much.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.427
Well, perhaps it's by design,

28:57.460 --> 28:59.928
or perhaps
it's just a bookshop.

28:59.970 --> 29:03.064
Mr. West was, after all,
imbalanced.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.864
So what about
the tattoos?

29:05.910 --> 29:08.401
At first, I thought they were
some form of encryption.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.135
Now I'm considering
the possibility

29:10.180 --> 29:11.875
that they are
a simple data set.

29:14.450 --> 29:17.317
Note the uniformity with which
certain patterns recur.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.215
We have strings
of consistent length

29:19.250 --> 29:21.252
containing only numbers here,

29:21.290 --> 29:24.919
followed by areas
of letters and numbers here

29:24.960 --> 29:27.178
and repeat.

29:27.230 --> 29:29.528
Here, at the beginning
of each "record,"

29:29.560 --> 29:31.926
I believe we have
dates and times.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.267
These three digits

29:33.300 --> 29:35.234
taken together at
the beginning of each record--

29:35.270 --> 29:37.864
they never exceed 365.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.037
Now faced with a canvas
of finite length,

29:40.070 --> 29:41.503
Arthur West stored the data

29:41.540 --> 29:43.872
on the fewest spaces
as possible.

29:43.910 --> 29:46.799
Beyond that, what the rest
of each record means,

29:46.850 --> 29:48.818
I haven't got a clue.

29:51.220 --> 29:54.781
You said you, uh, you had
something you wished to discuss.

29:56.090 --> 29:57.887
Before Mrs. West arrived.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.557
Yes.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.023
I'm moving out.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.051
Of?
Here.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.362
The brownstone.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.129
I need to get my own place.
It's time.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.058
Eh, codswallop.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.907
Excuse me?

30:12.940 --> 30:14.373
This is obviously
a knee-jerk reaction

30:14.410 --> 30:17.072
to what you've been through
the last few days.

30:17.110 --> 30:19.374
You feel violated, right? As if
you're no longer in control

30:19.410 --> 30:22.277
of your life, and you feel
the need to assert that control

30:22.320 --> 30:25.847
in some demonstrative,
if ill-advised, fashion.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.084
This needs a recharge.
I'll just...

30:27.120 --> 30:29.008
Actually, it's
none of that,

30:29.060 --> 30:30.379
but thank you for reducing
my feelings

30:30.420 --> 30:32.149
down to a psychological clich.

30:32.190 --> 30:33.851
This is just another ripple.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.151
It's another piece of fallout

30:35.200 --> 30:36.929
from my brother's intrusion
into our lives.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.962
We put a bit of distance
between him and ourselves,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.264
and these feelings of yours
will-will pass.

30:46.070 --> 30:48.436
Sherlock, this is not
because of what just happened,

30:48.480 --> 30:50.004
and it is definitely not
because of Mycroft.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.576
I decided this a while ago.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.271
I was just waiting
for the right time to tell you.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.017
So now, now's the right
time to tell me, is it?

30:56.050 --> 30:57.472
Days after my brother very
nearly got you killed,

30:57.520 --> 30:59.249
after I ﬁnd out he's been
lying to me for years.

30:59.290 --> 31:02.054
You get that it's never
a good time with you, right?

31:02.090 --> 31:04.126
I mean, if it wasn't this,
it would be something else.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.583
A police case,
a friend who needs your help.

31:06.630 --> 31:09.098
S-So, do you no longer
wish to be a detective?

31:09.130 --> 31:11.064
After all that time and energy
I put into your training?

31:11.100 --> 31:12.499
Okay, you're not
listening to me.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.168
I love what we do;
I love our partnership.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.236
Obviously.
But we do not need
to live together

31:16.270 --> 31:18.033
to consult for the police.

31:18.070 --> 31:20.402
Y-You're forgetting
how-how crucial

31:20.440 --> 31:22.237
our cohabitation has been
to our process.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.168
How much _we tend
to accomplish here.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.599
No, I am not forgetting.
It's just not enough.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.072
Oh, Watson, I...

31:28.120 --> 31:28.916
I know this is
hard for you.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.111
I know that you like things
just so,

31:31.150 --> 31:33.584
but I need room
for a life outside of this.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.657
Us, what we do.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.089
But we are what we do.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.654
No.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.591
You are what you do;
you have to be to be happy.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.188
I don't.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.359
(papers ruffle)

31:58.480 --> 32:00.948
SHERRINGTON: _
Well, you look like something

32:00.980 --> 32:02.311
the cat dragged in.

32:02.350 --> 32:03.578
Why didn't you tell
me Arthur West

32:03.620 --> 32:05.349
was watching me
back in London?

32:05.390 --> 32:07.449
Oh, worked that out, did you?

32:07.490 --> 32:08.684
Are you surprised?

32:08.720 --> 32:11.029
It was nothing personal.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.459
You're special.

32:12.490 --> 32:13.582
Special people draw attention.

32:13.630 --> 32:16.098
It's kind of flattering
after a fashion.

32:19.630 --> 32:22.667
You said you had
something to tell me?

32:22.700 --> 32:26.602
You and your fellow
"appreciators of specialness"--

32:26.640 --> 32:28.699
I think there's a better
than average chance

32:28.740 --> 32:29.729
you've been infiltrated.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.372
What?

32:31.410 --> 32:34.641
Arthur West thought
there was a mole in M16.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.444
Judging by everything that's
happened over the last few days,

32:37.480 --> 32:39.414
I think he might've been right.

32:41.790 --> 32:45.453
Whoever's took his arms
wanted those numbers.

32:45.490 --> 32:48.493
West thought they were proof
of the mole's existence.

32:48.530 --> 32:49.724
What are they?

32:49.760 --> 32:52.991
I haven't the foggiest.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.005
(sighs)

32:58.040 --> 33:01.498
I saw a mole hunt up close
once before.

33:01.540 --> 33:04.441
End of the Cold War.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.708
Grisly business.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.514
Good people and bad
got hurt.

33:13.550 --> 33:15.552
You still pregnant?

33:17.690 --> 33:21.057
With this? With the case?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.751
Are you going to go
through with it?

33:26.670 --> 33:29.332
Come on, Sherlock. Work for us.

33:29.370 --> 33:30.689
I've already
done far more...

33:30.740 --> 33:33.106
I mean officially.

33:33.140 --> 33:35.574
Permanently.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.742
West wasn't just a colleague,
he was a friend.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.578
And I know
what he thought about you.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.713
I didn't see it at first,
but, uh...

33:47.750 --> 33:50.457
I know you'd do
good things here.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.629
You help people.

33:52.660 --> 33:55.458
Imagine what you could do
with us.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.695
With our resources.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.191
You and my brother

34:02.240 --> 34:05.368
and this whole affair have
upturned my life quite enough.

34:07.370 --> 34:09.702
Good luck with your hunt.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.438
Good morning.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.446
Morning.

34:20.490 --> 34:21.809
We have coffee, cereal, fruit.

34:21.860 --> 34:25.125
Just coffee.
Uh, black. Thanks.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.355
I got in touch with
a friend of Sherlock's.

34:27.390 --> 34:30.188
He's getting you a temporary
ID. and a clean car

34:30.230 --> 34:32.824
and a place to go until
all this blows over.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.838
Thank you.

34:34.870 --> 34:36.735
I'm sorry about

34:36.770 --> 34:38.237
your ex-husband.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.807
I didn't get a chance to say so
last night.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.206
He was a good man.

34:49.350 --> 34:52.717
You said you knew
about Mycroft.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.411
The work he did.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.759
We never met, but...

34:57.790 --> 35:01.351
yeah, I knew.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.753
Sherlock thinks he must've known

35:02.800 --> 35:04.722
that Arthur was _
keeping an eye on him.

35:07.930 --> 35:12.401
He found out right before
he came back to MI6.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.862
What do you mean "came back"?

35:13.910 --> 35:16.470
Mycroft had gotten out.

35:16.510 --> 35:18.307
He'd moved on with his life.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.773
But...

35:22.780 --> 35:24.509
...then something happened.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.280
He had to come back.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.858
You building a fort?

35:34.900 --> 35:36.697
Cold cases.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.925
I perused your current ones
and found them quite mundane.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.359
Oh. We'll do
better next time.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.766
Your partner around?
Working apart today.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.633
Well, I thought you two
would want to know

35:46.670 --> 35:49.833
the Transit Bureau found a
handgun on the subway track

35:49.880 --> 35:52.804
a couple of blocks from
Arthur West's apartment.

35:52.850 --> 35:56.217
Ballistics match the slugs that
the ME. pulled out of the body.

35:56.250 --> 35:59.447
Lab was able to get a clean
set of prints off the gun,

35:59.490 --> 36:01.287
but no hits in
the system yet.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.788
Pretty distinct scar across

36:03.820 --> 36:05.549
the middle two
fingers there.

36:05.590 --> 36:09.526
Shouldn't be hard to match
once we have a suspect.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.869
Right.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.367
What's up?

36:13.400 --> 36:15.197
Oh, Ijust, uh...
I just remembered

36:15.240 --> 36:17.231
there's somewhere
I need to be.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.669
(knocking)

36:22.740 --> 36:23.900
Joan.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.942
Tell me about Sudomo Han.

36:25.980 --> 36:26.844
What?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.609
Sudomo Han.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.618
You obviously
know the name.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.515
I want to know what happened.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.637
Han was_
an IndoneSIan busmessman

36:55.680 --> 36:57.636
who kept an
office in London.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.409
About three years ago,

36:59.450 --> 37:01.577
when Sherlock was at the height
of his drug use--

37:01.620 --> 37:04.248
or at the bottom,
whichever way you look at it--

37:04.290 --> 37:07.919
Han approached him
to act as a sort of...

37:07.950 --> 37:10.589
confidential courier.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.020
Said he needed to...

37:13.060 --> 37:15.654
transfer a package
of trade secrets

37:15.700 --> 37:18.328
to a colleague without
his competitors ever finding out

37:18.370 --> 37:20.326
the package had passed hands.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.395
Sherlock took the job.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.768
Unfortunately,
what Sherlock didn't realize

37:26.810 --> 37:29.677
was that Han was financing
a terrorist plot.

37:29.710 --> 37:32.907
The trade secrets
were instructions

37:32.950 --> 37:34.975
for the transfer of funds,
and the competitors

37:35.020 --> 37:37.272
Sherlock managed to elude...

37:37.320 --> 37:39.379
were British agents.

37:39.420 --> 37:42.719
Luckily, MI6 thwarted the
attack, so no one was hurt,

37:42.760 --> 37:46.753
but in the process, Sherlock's
involvement came to light.

37:48.830 --> 37:52.061
He, uh...

37:52.100 --> 37:56.491
could have been sent to prison
for a very long time.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.868
So MI6 offered you a deal.

38:00.910 --> 38:03.538
By my handler.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.447
He said if I came back to work,

38:06.480 --> 38:09.313
Sherlock's problems
would disappear.

38:10.980 --> 38:14.780
In other words, everything
that you did for MI6--

38:14.820 --> 38:18.620
letting drug traffickers
use your restaurants--

38:18.660 --> 38:20.855
that wasn't for money.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.448
Or to save your business.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.491
That was all
to protect Sherlock.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.865
Why didn't you tell him?

38:32.870 --> 38:35.009
Why didn't you tell me?

38:37.980 --> 38:40.676
And accomplish what?

38:40.710 --> 38:43.645
Telling you after the fact
would be a paltry attempt

38:43.680 --> 38:47.582
to dodge blame,
and telling him...

38:47.620 --> 38:51.556
it could've sent him
down a bad road.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.024
And you know that
better than anyone.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.020
He's more fragile
than he cares to admit.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.736
The two of us, we...

39:04.770 --> 39:08.331
we share that
burden, don't we?

39:10.140 --> 39:13.439
Taking care of him, whether
he realizes it or not.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.472
*

40:13.110 --> 40:15.169
Mycroft.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.149
What?

40:26.190 --> 40:29.717
Only that this is quite
literally the last place

40:29.760 --> 40:32.228
I expected to be
at the beginning of the day.

40:32.260 --> 40:33.887
(laughs)

40:33.930 --> 40:35.352
You're telling me.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.527
(groans)

40:40.570 --> 40:42.595
Please don't do that.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.131
Whatever it is,
just say it.

40:45.170 --> 40:49.209
No, it risks putting an
irreparable damper on the mood.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.208
Hmm.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.105
Sherlock?

40:55.120 --> 40:56.917
As we both know,

40:56.950 --> 40:59.612
he's gonna make things
very difficult for us.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.753
I_told him I was
movmg out last night.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.098
How did that go?

41:09.130 --> 41:12.099
Horribly.

41:12.130 --> 41:15.691
But, you know what, right
now I don't care about that.

41:15.740 --> 41:19.232
Right now, that is
his problem, not mine.

41:20.710 --> 41:23.099
Correction...

41:23.140 --> 41:25.540
not ours.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.698
Mr. Sherrington,
I have some news.

41:44.730 --> 41:47.164
I believe I know
who the mole is.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.839
I'm going to find him.

41:52.340 --> 41:53.659
(door crashes)

41:53.710 --> 41:54.938
What the hell was that?

41:56.310 --> 41:57.834
(gun cocks)

41:58.580 --> 41:59.239
(gasps)

41:59.280 --> 42:00.269
Good God, man.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.572
Sherlock,
what are you doing here?

42:01.620 --> 42:03.178
I could ask you the same thing.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.017
If only there were time.

42:05.050 --> 42:06.779
What are you doing?

42:08.250 --> 42:09.751
You're gonna want to pack a bag.
Oh, am I?

42:09.790 --> 42:11.257
You need to get out of here,
both of you, now.

42:11.290 --> 42:13.224
Why?
His fingerprints are on the gun

42:13.260 --> 42:15.125
which was used
to kill Arthur West.
What?

42:15.160 --> 42:16.252
It turned up,

42:16.300 --> 42:17.790
replete with your fingerprints.

42:17.830 --> 42:20.060
Police are still running them
through their database,

42:20.100 --> 42:22.295
but I recognized them
straightaway.
How is that possible?

42:22.340 --> 42:25.309
I confess to studying them quite
intently when we were children.

42:25.340 --> 42:27.934
Your whorls and loops
are as familiar to me

42:27.970 --> 42:29.938
as your very face,
as is the scar

42:29.980 --> 42:32.301
across your middle and
ring finger on your right hand.

42:32.350 --> 42:35.319
Knife trick gone awry,
age 13, if memory serves.

42:35.350 --> 42:36.840
Pathetic.

42:37.980 --> 42:39.117
Sherlock, I don't understand.

42:39.150 --> 42:40.310
It's quite simple.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.318
You're being framed.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.248
For murder and treason.
