01:14.620 --> 01:17.658
The Exeter School for
the feeble minded.

01:17.717 --> 01:20.288
The facilities original purpose

01:20.357 --> 01:24.177
was to educate and rehabilitate
mentally challenge

01:24.245 --> 01:26.470
and mentally deranged children.

01:28.466 --> 01:30.868
Established in 1916.

01:30.941 --> 01:33.419
Exeter's population grew rapidly,

01:33.470 --> 01:35.289
resulting in overcrowd.

01:35.368 --> 01:38.706
There was rampant physical abuse
and neglect.

01:38.777 --> 01:41.145
The children were no longer patients.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.769
They were inmates.

01:42.868 --> 01:45.582
Several died due to these conditions.

01:45.665 --> 01:47.607
So common were these tragedies

01:47.672 --> 01:50.508
that officials commissioned
an on site graveyard

01:50.578 --> 01:52.881
But space eventually ran out.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.051
They simply erected a crematorium.

01:55.084 --> 01:58.273
Exeter was not a place where
young people found help,

01:58.298 --> 02:02.285
but a place where they were
discarded and destroyed.

02:02.317 --> 02:05.324
In the late 70s,
the facility was shut down.

02:05.388 --> 02:08.193
For egregious human rights violations.

02:08.219 --> 02:11.873
It is rumored that the halls of Exeter
are still haunted

02:11.898 --> 02:16.391
by the soul of all those who were wronged here.

02:23.746 --> 02:25.425
Sure is warm.

02:25.450 --> 02:28.340
Patrick, I'm getting hot under the collar.

02:28.452 --> 02:31.636
We can begin on the second floor
on Monday morning.

02:31.661 --> 02:34.020
- What about the attic?
- Attic is just filled with junk.

02:34.045 --> 02:36.059
We'll get to it sometime.

02:36.498 --> 02:38.727
So have you heard back from State.

02:38.752 --> 02:40.160
Rejected.

02:40.198 --> 02:41.713
Yeah.

02:41.742 --> 02:44.439
You didn't apply.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.910
How did you know?

02:47.024 --> 02:51.997
You have no talent for deceiving anyone
with the exception of yourself.

02:52.022 --> 02:55.527
I got a lot of stuff going on you know.
College isn't really my thing

02:55.557 --> 02:58.977
- Yeah. Girls, parties.
- They have that at State too.

02:59.026 --> 03:01.991
Yes, but it's a better class of people

03:02.478 --> 03:05.044
Why are you always trashing my friends.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.771
You're all my children.

03:09.548 --> 03:12.918
But I think the lord has something special
in mind for you.

03:15.077 --> 03:17.713
- Bright and early.
- Okay.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.049
- Father you got anything else?
- That's it.

03:21.074 --> 03:23.874
- Can I take a look.
- Knock yourself out.

03:25.077 --> 03:26.881
Hey pencil dick,
where're you going?

03:26.906 --> 03:28.471
Grab a box.

03:30.339 --> 03:32.539
When are they going to tear
that shithole down?

03:32.657 --> 03:34.469
They're remodeling it actually.

03:34.494 --> 03:37.385
- Into what?
- A youth center.

03:37.410 --> 03:39.223
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:39.248 --> 03:41.210
 Do you know what went on here?

03:41.503 --> 03:43.976
A bunch of fucked up kids.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.917
They should've let this place burned.

03:55.765 --> 03:57.615
- Check it out bitch.
- What up, Knowles.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.405
- El Salvador's finest.
- Is that subtitled porn?

04:00.430 --> 04:03.408
These guys hung like a grandfather clock.
We're watching volume 1 to 10 tonight.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.186
No, I can't,
Conway wants me back in the morning.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.503
- You're still fucking around up there?
- Yes, it's a nightmare.

04:12.565 --> 04:14.234
No one had set foot in there
like a decade.

04:14.264 --> 04:16.849
Really.
So... it's empty.

04:16.874 --> 04:19.665
- Yes, let's party.
- Hey! No, no way.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.033
Why not?
No cops, no neighbors. It's perfect.

04:22.058 --> 04:23.045
- No.
- Yes

04:23.070 --> 04:24.343
I said no.

04:24.713 --> 04:26.104
Shit!

04:27.345 --> 04:30.066
Shit!
Shit!

04:33.480 --> 04:35.293
Rory, get up!

04:35.708 --> 04:37.438
Someone spitting.

04:40.599 --> 04:43.169
- How did you know I wasn't dead?
- We didn't.

04:43.194 --> 04:44.456
I'm not that lucky.

04:44.481 --> 04:46.140
Hey-hey.
What is this, porn?

04:46.172 --> 04:47.378
Is it for me.

04:47.403 --> 04:49.944
Got to work for it,
work for it.

04:49.969 --> 04:51.733
Gimme that.
Don't you have any friends, man?

04:51.758 --> 04:54.553
Yo man.
Bring Vodka, Jagger, Tequila.

04:54.578 --> 04:56.277
- Tell your brother, ring a beer party...
- Forget it, I said.

04:56.302 --> 04:59.376
- Where’s the party, man?
- No. There is no party.

05:04.502 --> 05:07.237
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you for coming.

05:07.262 --> 05:09.033
Seriously,
Knowles.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.371
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:10.396 --> 05:11.734
a pussy...

05:11.759 --> 05:13.837
New Facebook friends.
Nice.

05:14.225 --> 05:17.085
Hey! Hey, please!
What the hell!

05:17.110 --> 05:19.519
- Hey, no pyro shit, alright?
- Suck it.

05:19.544 --> 05:20.936
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Hey!

05:20.961 --> 05:22.610
- Patrick, let it go.
- Hey! Come here.

05:22.635 --> 05:25.960
Let it go. Don't follow that guy in the woods.
That's how rapes happened.

05:25.985 --> 05:28.094
Hope you brought your whistle.

05:28.586 --> 05:30.549
Hey!
Hey!

05:30.574 --> 05:33.261
Oh!
You fucking ass ranger.

05:33.286 --> 05:35.464
Oh, you lucky bitch.

05:40.343 --> 05:42.607
What's up man?

05:43.788 --> 05:45.417
What are you doing?

05:45.442 --> 05:46.720
Her.

05:48.555 --> 05:50.412
Got a light?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.124
Conway's gonna burst a vein.

05:59.179 --> 06:01.503
What's he gonna do?
Kick you out of the choir? Oh, no.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.066
I don't even know like
half these people, man.

06:03.099 --> 06:05.320
Oh.
Then you have to mingle, sir.

06:05.345 --> 06:09.700
Patrick, turned an ocean of premium artist in,
over here to contemplate your fagness.

06:09.725 --> 06:11.469
How dare you?

06:14.246 --> 06:16.811
Get this party started, right?

06:16.843 --> 06:18.444
You're pretty.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.920
Dude!
Who’s that guy?

06:20.964 --> 06:23.545
I pretty sure that's Drew, right.
He's from Fresno (California).

06:23.577 --> 06:26.070
Yeah, he just kissed me the head.
That was awesome.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.530
Now.
That's what I call awesome.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.219
- Holy Shit!
- Yeah, look at that subtle ass.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.814
She's been looking at you, dude.

06:33.839 --> 06:35.008
- Shut up.
- You never asked.

06:35.033 --> 06:37.529
- Yeah, you're lying.
- No, I'm not.  Watch.

06:37.554 --> 06:39.349
I got it.
Hey.

06:41.722 --> 06:43.380
I'm Patrick.

06:44.399 --> 06:45.960
Allow me.

06:48.478 --> 06:50.504
That's okay.
Let me get it.

06:55.098 --> 06:56.680
Impressive.

06:56.705 --> 06:58.414
It's a twist off.

06:59.015 --> 07:00.354
So, how's your night going.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.443
Say hello to my little friend.

07:06.374 --> 07:09.374
- Could you get the fuck out of here, please.
- Easy. Easy.

07:09.399 --> 07:12.387
Sorry, it's just..
this place already burned once.

07:12.412 --> 07:14.048
Why do you care?

07:14.073 --> 07:16.005
- I work here.
- You work here?

07:16.030 --> 07:17.857
Yeah, I am a volunteer of the church.

07:18.391 --> 07:20.490
- Hey Patrick ..
- Excuse me.

07:20.515 --> 07:22.813
- Sorry.
- Sorry. Hi.

07:23.202 --> 07:25.111
- Be right back.
- Okay.

07:25.636 --> 07:28.408
You uh..volunteer for the church.
What the fuck are you talking about?

07:28.433 --> 07:30.931
- Trying to start a conversation.
- No, you're trying to get laid.

07:30.956 --> 07:33.016
And that's not gonna happen
with your pigeon Jesus.

07:33.041 --> 07:33.988
You do not say that.

07:34.013 --> 07:36.591
- Where are you going?
- My ride is taking off.

07:36.616 --> 07:38.760
Well, I mean.
I can give you a ride.

07:38.785 --> 07:41.272
Well,  you don't want to miss
the after party.

07:41.297 --> 07:43.046
It will be crazy.

08:02.045 --> 08:04.701
- What brings you to town?
- Family reunion.

08:04.725 --> 08:06.800
- And how's it going?
- It's deadly.

08:06.825 --> 08:08.957
Only if you kick in the dick.

08:08.982 --> 08:10.177
Don't touch anything.
I'm not going.

08:10.202 --> 08:11.674
- I won.
- Oh, my god.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.815
I knew there was going to to be
an apple pie here today.

08:14.841 --> 08:17.713
- Oh. what're you. Psychic?
- Dude, everyone is psychic.

08:17.738 --> 08:19.020
Why is this today?

08:19.045 --> 08:20.301
Okay look.

08:20.326 --> 08:22.958
Every seven years the moon
is in the Seventh House.

08:22.990 --> 08:26.374
Like our third eye right now.
Fully dilated

08:26.399 --> 08:28.482
- That's a shroom.
- Yeah. And the bullshit.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.323
No, no, no...
This isn't nice...

08:30.348 --> 08:32.095
You dip it in again.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.827
- Hey.
- What.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.168
You hit that.
Fuck her.

08:38.193 --> 08:39.275
Dude.
I just met her.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.735
Patrick, if you're not ploughing
her within the next hour.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.818
I'm going to have to do it, okay.

08:42.842 --> 08:44.704
Alright, yeah.
And Amber will chop your balls off.

08:44.729 --> 08:47.223
I've thought about that.
I'm... I'm gonna fuck her.

08:47.279 --> 08:49.403
- Okay, you do that. You do that.
- I'm gonna have to...

08:49.447 --> 08:51.260
- Right. Right.
- I will fuck her.

09:19.589 --> 09:22.105
Take a look.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.873
Rory.
Get out!

09:31.898 --> 09:33.653
I'll tell.

09:34.870 --> 09:39.174
Alright.
If you drink, smoke or break anything,
I'll beat your ass.

09:39.482 --> 09:41.084
Too late.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.433
- I said no drinking.
- Fuck you.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.706
Didn't your mother teach
you anything Drew?

09:54.731 --> 09:56.784
Seriously, Drew...

09:56.809 --> 09:59.003
- You got to piss on the wall?
- Oh, that's gross.

09:59.028 --> 10:01.647
That's Church property.
It's holy water.

10:01.672 --> 10:03.057
Work here so.

10:03.082 --> 10:04.723
Where did they keep
the shock therapy?

10:04.748 --> 10:08.350
- It's rehab. Not... asylum, dude.
- Same thing.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.444
Those crackheads crack as wreck.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.838
Yeah. Did they teach you
that at youth camp?

10:12.863 --> 10:14.578
Why, you been to rehab?

10:14.618 --> 10:16.730
All I'm saying is people have
bigger problems than uh...

10:16.770 --> 10:19.865
what kind of pudding
their mom packed for their lunch.

10:19.890 --> 10:21.921
Didn't this place used
to be a nut house?

10:21.946 --> 10:24.541
Yeah, it's actually a psych hospital.

10:24.566 --> 10:28.052
It wasn't a hospital as much as it was
 a dumpster for human refuge

10:28.077 --> 10:30.002
Psychos,
gimps.

10:30.027 --> 10:31.290
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

10:31.315 --> 10:32.632
And then in the 80s.

10:32.657 --> 10:35.040
The church bought it
and turned it into a rehab.

10:35.065 --> 10:38.148
Whoa whoa. You okay?
Just let it out.

10:38.172 --> 10:39.833
- Yeah.
- He's alright.

10:39.858 --> 10:42.340
Wait, why would the Church
buy this place?

10:42.365 --> 10:46.533
It's 'cos it was fully equipped for
Conway's fascist mind tortures.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.949
- Oh. Seriously, Knowles?
- Yeah.

10:48.974 --> 10:49.922
- Yeah, I heard that.
- It's true.

10:49.947 --> 10:51.926
There was a kid in here
that went absolutely berserk.

10:51.958 --> 10:54.268
And all the other patients started
going psycho.

10:54.293 --> 10:58.653
Suicidal, attacks and then Conway burned
this place to the ground to cover his ass.

10:58.678 --> 11:01.337
Yeah, why would Conway
torched a building Knowles.

11:01.386 --> 11:05.964
I'm looking it up here.
"Local church shuts down rehab facility due to fire."

11:05.989 --> 11:09.067
He created that version and
he blamed it on Rock 'N' Roll.

11:09.092 --> 11:10.982
- Oh, oh. Yeah , yeah, yeah!
- You alright?

11:11.007 --> 11:13.503
- Forgot about the backmasking.
- The backmasking, exactly.

11:13.528 --> 11:14.688
What is backmasking?

11:14.713 --> 11:16.992
It's when a band records messages
backwards into their songs.

11:17.017 --> 11:20.082
The clergy convinced the parents that
there were satanic messages in the music.

11:20.107 --> 11:22.142
And the press was all over it.
Here. Check it out.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.667
Where?

11:24.187 --> 11:27.960
Exeter had become home to
unconventional methods of punishment.

11:27.985 --> 11:29.661
resembling an exorcisms.

11:29.686 --> 11:32.061
The patient went missing in fire.

11:32.086 --> 11:34.864
There were vivid accounts of
electroshock therapy

11:34.889 --> 11:36.709
Conway denied any wrong doings.

11:36.734 --> 11:40.552
And cited Rock 'N' Roll, an occult experimentation,
as the cause of the arsenal.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.393
Yeah.
Actually, there's this Emo girl on YouTube.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.999
Swears she can make herself weightless.

11:45.024 --> 11:47.136
- Pull it up. Pull it up.
- I want to see.

11:48.646 --> 11:51.265
- That's fake! That's fake.
- Look at that.

11:51.290 --> 11:52.957
- What the fuck...
- Fake.

11:52.982 --> 11:54.952
- There could be something to this.
- How?

11:54.977 --> 11:57.969
If you believe something enough.
It effects you physically.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.624
Let's do it.

12:00.879 --> 12:03.942
- It's for tardity
- Oh, honey. Are you scared?

12:03.967 --> 12:06.192
I'm not scared, you know?
You know what .

12:06.217 --> 12:07.230
If it doesn't work.

12:07.255 --> 12:09.475
I get to nail you in
a different shaft.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.170
Fine.
Done.

12:11.195 --> 12:13.781
- He's talking about her ass.
- Game on!

12:13.806 --> 12:16.819
- Oh god!
- Okay. Look, I need a volunteer.

12:16.844 --> 12:18.374
Drew?

12:18.685 --> 12:20.866
I'm super famey.

12:20.891 --> 12:22.313
I do it.

12:22.338 --> 12:23.686
- Yeah!
- Alright!

12:23.711 --> 12:26.042
You the bitch!
You the bitch!

12:26.067 --> 12:29.758
Rory! Rory!
Rory!...

12:30.372 --> 12:33.044
Okay, Knowles.
Just come over this side.

12:33.552 --> 12:36.072
- Hey. Are you good for it.
- Alright.

12:36.097 --> 12:37.824
-Okay
- Alright.

12:37.849 --> 12:40.126
Two fingers, are going to go
under his body, okay?

12:40.151 --> 12:42.239
Drew, two fingers.

12:44.465 --> 12:46.787
Okay.
Two fingers underneath his body and...

12:46.812 --> 12:49.693
I just want everybody to close their eyes.

12:49.718 --> 12:54.768
And breathe in...
And breathe out...

12:55.781 --> 12:59.320
Let your mind drift
into the silence...

12:59.345 --> 13:01.301
- What the fuck!
- Oh...

13:01.326 --> 13:03.060
- Concentrate.
- I did.

13:03.085 --> 13:04.397
That's good, get it.

13:04.422 --> 13:07.706
-  Oh, my god. That's so immature!
- Smells like Brad's mom's pussy.

13:08.768 --> 13:10.777
Shut up and levitate already.
Please.

13:10.802 --> 13:13.495
That's immature.
Stop it...!

13:13.520 --> 13:15.837
- Stop it.
- Okay.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.224
Fingers.
Thank you.

13:18.249 --> 13:22.809
Rory died in a car accident,
here his body lies...

13:23.036 --> 13:25.716
Light as a feather, stiff as a board

13:25.741 --> 13:28.343
Light as a feather, stiff as a board

13:28.368 --> 13:30.507
Light as a feather, stiff as a board

13:30.532 --> 13:31.734
One.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.926
Jesus.
Guys.

13:34.951 --> 13:38.215
One. One.
One. One.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.517
Two. Two.
Two. Two.

13:41.542 --> 13:44.828
- Three.
- Three.

13:44.853 --> 13:48.606
- Four.
- Four.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.249
- What the fuck.
- Oh shit.

14:05.274 --> 14:07.658
- What. What.
- What the fuck.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.864
- You alright?
- Rory, Rory.

14:10.889 --> 14:12.293
You alright?

14:12.788 --> 14:14.256
- He pissed himself.
- Oh my god.

14:14.281 --> 14:15.913
That's beer.
That is beer.

14:15.945 --> 14:19.081
And it came from you dick.
Aren't that amazing.

14:19.106 --> 14:21.221
Fuck you guys!

14:21.951 --> 14:25.348
Hey. You owe me, by the way.
You pay up.

14:25.427 --> 14:27.697
What the fuck.
We got him off the ground, Brad.

14:27.722 --> 14:29.639
If he weighs like 50 pounds.
I can pick him up with one hand.

14:29.664 --> 14:30.916
- You owe me, baby.
- No, no.

14:30.941 --> 14:33.530
You guys.
You saw something happened.

14:33.555 --> 14:36.746
Yeah, you lost your bet.
Start stretching.

14:36.771 --> 14:38.450
Oh my God!

14:38.475 --> 14:39.760
Perverts!

14:39.792 --> 14:43.429
You saw him get off the ground, right.
I'm pretty sure of it.

14:43.454 --> 14:46.183
- 50 pounds, I could pick him with one hand.
- Well you didn't, did you.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.550
We all did it together and you
saw that something happened.

14:48.575 --> 14:50.297
Don't be stupid.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.083
Where are you going?

14:52.190 --> 14:53.772
Wait up!

14:53.797 --> 14:55.926
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Wait up.

14:55.951 --> 14:58.261
Hold on.
What happened?

14:58.286 --> 15:00.087
I'm tired.

15:00.462 --> 15:03.793
Wait till I sober up.
We'll dropped you a way off and hit Danny's.

15:05.181 --> 15:06.622
Come on.

15:06.892 --> 15:09.007
You know you want pancakes.

15:09.905 --> 15:13.191
- No, I don't.
- Sit down.

15:14.649 --> 15:16.432
Two seconds.

15:22.657 --> 15:25.579
- You made that?
- My mother did.

15:25.643 --> 15:27.025
It's cool.

15:28.263 --> 15:29.734
You guys close?

15:29.759 --> 15:31.802
Yeah, we're pretty tight.

15:31.928 --> 15:34.148
There's just the two of us.

15:34.173 --> 15:36.151
Did your dad died?

15:36.592 --> 15:38.407
Upgraded.

15:38.535 --> 15:40.101
Mine too.

15:40.126 --> 15:42.850
He moved in with a stripper
when I was 10.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.706
Men have it so easily.

15:45.731 --> 15:47.749
They get tired of the family.

15:47.771 --> 15:50.467
They can just go and start a new one.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.223
I'm over it.

15:52.248 --> 15:54.843
- Is Rory?
- What do you mean?

15:54.868 --> 15:56.779
Just worry about him.

15:56.804 --> 15:59.644
Don't fall for his shit.
He's a complete attention norm.

15:59.669 --> 16:01.913
Yeah. That's because nobody
is paying attention.

16:01.938 --> 16:03.212
The kid follows me around everywhere.

16:03.237 --> 16:05.223
He's been a pain in my ass
since day one.

16:05.248 --> 16:07.759
He's a lonely damage kid.

16:07.785 --> 16:10.234
Somebody has to take responsible.

16:10.950 --> 16:12.936
He's fine.

16:13.464 --> 16:15.671
Then, where is he?

16:20.047 --> 16:21.658
Jesus.

16:21.812 --> 16:23.492
How low can you go?

16:23.517 --> 16:25.358
You have no idea.

16:33.622 --> 16:34.950
Bitch!

16:35.791 --> 16:38.705
- Do it.   Do it.
- Oh no, I'm so scared.

16:40.226 --> 16:42.209
I love you so fucking much.

16:45.341 --> 16:49.080
Okay guys...
Okay...

16:49.105 --> 16:50.600
Yes!

16:50.625 --> 16:53.614
Oh,no...
I just lost...

16:53.639 --> 16:55.975
Oh no...

17:08.513 --> 17:11.374
- Rory.
- Rory.

17:17.951 --> 17:19.294
Rory!

17:21.396 --> 17:22.638
Patrick.

17:23.327 --> 17:24.486
Grab it!
Grab it!

17:24.511 --> 17:27.006
Rory.
Put it down.

17:40.349 --> 17:41.876
Hey. Hey.
Hey

17:41.901 --> 17:44.390
Calm down!
Calm Down!

17:44.487 --> 17:46.264
Calm down.

17:49.559 --> 17:51.609
Give me the flashlight.

17:53.601 --> 17:54.952
Rory.

17:55.523 --> 17:57.886
His eyes are so dilated.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.631
He needs a doctor.

17:59.656 --> 18:01.391
He needs a priest.

18:01.416 --> 18:03.161
No, no, no.
It's the drugs.

18:05.329 --> 18:07.448
Look at his eyes.

18:10.459 --> 18:12.806
The last person I want here
is Father Conway. Alright.

18:12.831 --> 18:13.854
We need to...

18:16.203 --> 18:17.553
Rory!

18:17.625 --> 18:19.312
Now.
Get him off!

18:24.581 --> 18:27.222
- What the fuck.
- What the fuck is that?

18:28.401 --> 18:30.259
Brothers.

18:43.049 --> 18:45.889
- Call him. Call him.
- What?

18:54.019 --> 18:57.213
- Oh shit. Its his voice mail machine.
- Jus-Just leave a message.

18:57.749 --> 19:00.704
Hi, this is Patrick ..
Hey.

19:00.987 --> 19:05.055
I'm down at the center right now,
Just cleaning up and uh...

19:05.302 --> 19:07.227
There's...
There's been a...

19:09.047 --> 19:11.769
...situation...
Um...

19:11.934 --> 19:15.935
If you can come down here, right now.
That would be good.

19:16.107 --> 19:18.843
Everything’s fine...
It's just...

19:18.960 --> 19:21.396
If you have any holy water,
you might want to bring it.

19:26.770 --> 19:27.981
- Whoa.
- What the fuck.

19:28.006 --> 19:30.890
Guys, there's something
really wrong with Rory.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.095
He's high.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.673
He's speaking in tongues.

19:36.698 --> 19:39.675
He mixed "E" and thyroxine.
He'll get his language skills back in a few days.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.391
No man. You didn't see him, his eyes.

19:41.416 --> 19:44.000
Dude, you need to chillex.
Just let him sleep it off. He'll be fine.

19:44.025 --> 19:45.569
I've see him Zanax sometimes.

19:45.594 --> 19:47.668
- I called Father Conway.
- What! - Whoa!

19:47.707 --> 19:48.802
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:48.827 --> 19:51.989
We have PCP, L, E,
Vyx, Oxi, Morphine...

19:52.014 --> 19:53.370
You called a fucking priest?

19:53.395 --> 19:55.314
- Brad, listen to me. He is possessed!
- You called a priest!

19:55.339 --> 19:58.428
He's frying his balls off, Patrick.
It's call being high.

19:59.497 --> 20:01.322
What the fuck!

20:01.663 --> 20:03.279
Ground's full of shit.

20:03.304 --> 20:04.256
Hey, man.

20:04.296 --> 20:05.835
What the fuck is going on here?

20:05.860 --> 20:08.731
Oh nothing. I was just...
just cleaning up here.

20:13.235 --> 20:15.580
What's he doing?
The fucking bible study?

20:15.605 --> 20:17.782
No,
I don’t even know him and...

20:17.845 --> 20:19.694
Those pills were already here
when we got here.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.269
- Just taking a nap
- Yeah.

20:21.294 --> 20:22.899
We're leaving.

20:23.438 --> 20:26.359
- We're gone
- Yeah, we're going out the door.

20:26.384 --> 20:27.259
Later.

20:27.284 --> 20:28.839
No one is going anywhere
until I call the cops.

20:28.864 --> 20:30.756
- Wait, wait, wait...
- No, no .. Please. - No, no, no.

20:30.781 --> 20:32.605
I can't go to jail,
you know what they'll do to me in there?

20:32.630 --> 20:34.042
Yeah!
They'll fucking ass rape you.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.315
I just got into community college,

20:35.347 --> 20:38.533
And this will really ruin my life.
so if you don't mind, we'll just all good boyt.

20:38.558 --> 20:42.348
Oh, boo-hoo.
It's going to take a little more than tears. Doll.

20:43.066 --> 20:45.274
What do you want to do
for me, honey huh?

20:45.299 --> 20:47.711
Maybe you can come up to my truck
and we can figure it out.

20:47.736 --> 20:50.164
- What do you have in mind?
- What've you got to offer mer?

20:50.220 --> 20:51.408
Listen, that's my girlfriend, okay?

20:51.433 --> 20:53.211
You fucking touch me again,
I'll blow your head off.

20:53.266 --> 20:57.070
Alright, alright. Okay.
Now we know. Now we know. Okay.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.546
What the fuck is that?

20:59.577 --> 21:01.255
Bad plumbing.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.883
What've you got?
The hot one upstairs?

21:04.909 --> 21:06.318
What's that suppose to mean?

21:06.343 --> 21:09.054
- Greer, you really don't want to go up there.
- Wait, wait, wait...

21:10.649 --> 21:14.198
Sir. You have no probable cause
to be here right now.

21:16.967 --> 21:19.373
- You said something?
- No!

21:20.231 --> 21:21.383
Fuck this chasseresse.

21:21.408 --> 21:23.792
There's really nothing up there
you want to see.

21:24.066 --> 21:25.544
- Who is he?
- No, no, no...

21:34.273 --> 21:36.585
Come out and play.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.295
Party time.

22:06.253 --> 22:08.140
Hello.

22:20.626 --> 22:22.513
What the shit is this?

22:23.708 --> 22:24.911
Hey.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.064
Hey.

22:28.493 --> 22:29.820
Hey.

22:52.636 --> 22:55.617

- Rory.

23:12.871 --> 23:14.662
Oh god!

23:16.645 --> 23:18.706
Fuck this shit!

23:27.020 --> 23:28.729
Go, go go...

23:28.754 --> 23:30.703
My God, my God, my God...

23:49.860 --> 23:52.216
Oh my god!
Did you see that?

23:52.241 --> 23:54.664
Yeah I'm fucking wearing
his fuck head!

23:55.937 --> 23:58.127
Stop it!
Oh shit!

23:59.829 --> 24:01.249
Holy fuck!

24:01.289 --> 24:04.178
- Oh my go! What the fuck!
- What do I do! What do I do!

24:04.203 --> 24:07.365
Oh... my... God...!

24:08.391 --> 24:10.784
What the fuck!
What the fuck!

24:11.746 --> 24:12.948
Oh my God!

24:21.254 --> 24:22.931
Oh my god.

24:23.971 --> 24:25.777
Is that Conway?

24:25.938 --> 24:27.143
Fuck!

24:27.211 --> 24:29.917
- What the fuck happened?
- He jumped!

24:30.614 --> 24:32.082
Is he alive?

24:32.342 --> 24:34.216
No pulse.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.024
Shit!

24:36.049 --> 24:38.640
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling the cops!!

24:39.396 --> 24:41.414
- He's dead!
- Stop!

24:43.518 --> 24:45.703
You can't just call the police.

24:45.728 --> 24:48.543
Oh shit! what the fuck is that?
What is that?

24:48.568 --> 24:52.301
No, dude. I'm on probation man.
I can't do this shit.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.571
- This is on you man.
- Your the one who killed him, man!

24:55.596 --> 24:57.733
You're the one who brought him out when
your psycho brother killed Greer!

24:57.758 --> 24:59.454
Rory's possessed!
You asso!

24:59.479 --> 25:01.326
Don't you touch me!
Don't you.

25:01.351 --> 25:03.713
Hey, you guys are starting to freak me out.
So shut the fuck up!

25:03.738 --> 25:05.898
You guys!
We have to clean this stuff up.

25:06.850 --> 25:08.568
Alright, we got 2 options.

25:08.593 --> 25:11.498
We hide him or
we're going to jail.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.555
Oh...
My god...

25:15.580 --> 25:17.658
Fuck!
Fuck!

25:21.592 --> 25:23.252
I got to go.
I got to go get help..

25:23.277 --> 25:25.246
Nobody leaves.
Nobody leaves.

25:25.296 --> 25:27.207
Don't fucking touch me.

25:27.232 --> 25:31.071
Look, just... uh.
What do we need to do here, okay ?

25:32.686 --> 25:34.140
Oh my god.

25:34.744 --> 25:38.238
Who wants to spend the next decade
getting fist on B block, huh?

25:45.690 --> 25:47.287
So let's get rid of him.

25:47.522 --> 25:50.149
- I think it's best if we just bury him okay?
- No.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.599
- Or we burn the place.
- Fuck yeah, let's torch it.

25:52.624 --> 25:54.485
- We're not torching shit.
- Shut up!

25:54.525 --> 25:58.057
Here is what we're gonna do.
We take out their teeth.

25:58.082 --> 26:00.434
We saw them into manageable pieces,

26:00.459 --> 26:04.312
Melt them down in acid.
Grind the remaining into a fine paste.

26:04.337 --> 26:06.118
Pour that shit in jam jars and
then we're going to

26:06.143 --> 26:10.399
disperse them in dumpsters all over town.
Any questions? Concerns?

26:11.853 --> 26:14.070
Where are we going to get jam jars.

26:14.095 --> 26:15.973
We are not dismembering a priest.

26:16.005 --> 26:19.030
- If they're identified, we're fuck Patrick.
- Who cares if they're identified?

26:19.055 --> 26:21.927
We wiped our prints.
Grab our shit and we bail.

27:24.525 --> 27:26.527
I'm going to fix this, okay.

27:26.552 --> 27:30.970
I promise you, Rory.
I will fix this. Okay.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.501
I promise.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.460
Jesus,
Patrick.

27:46.963 --> 27:49.537
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

27:49.871 --> 27:51.660
Look at that.

27:53.583 --> 27:56.359
All one drawer for just one patient.

27:58.573 --> 28:00.339
Devon Ryer.

28:00.364 --> 28:03.573
Age 14,
born addicted.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.540
Parents unknown.

28:05.565 --> 28:08.205
Escaped several institutions.

28:08.230 --> 28:12.837
Created by Father Charles Conway.

28:13.801 --> 28:15.634
Let me see that.

28:19.468 --> 28:22.393
Patient displays extreme
violent behavior,  pathological liar.

28:22.418 --> 28:25.739
sociopathic tendencies,
does not respond to treatment.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.340
This is the patient that went berserk.

28:29.365 --> 28:31.518
I thought that was just a rumor.

28:31.543 --> 28:36.392
Maybe. Whatever happened
to this kid is happening to Rory.

28:40.314 --> 28:42.541
- There's a tape.
- Here.

28:49.917 --> 28:53.059
This was nothing like the symptoms
of withdrawal.

28:53.084 --> 28:55.918
Davon exhibited extraordinary abilities.

28:55.943 --> 29:03.336
to manipulate people vicariously into
erratic and sometimes violent behavior.

29:03.361 --> 29:07.017
Gavin, you have to talk sometime.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.996
or maybe you rather go back ...

29:14.612 --> 29:16.618
Devon's fucking freak out...

29:19.255 --> 29:20.465
Gavin!

29:20.902 --> 29:23.383
We then restrained and confined Davon.

29:23.408 --> 29:29.648
But this only seemed to
intensify these abilities.

29:31.652 --> 29:33.290
Play it backwards.

29:36.657 --> 29:39.329
This place will burn!

29:55.865 --> 29:57.463
You hear that?

29:57.488 --> 29:58.990
Who is doing this?

30:00.752 --> 30:02.741
Someone lock the doors.

30:02.766 --> 30:04.686
Guys, come on!

30:05.848 --> 30:08.021
- We are locked in!
- What?

30:08.046 --> 30:09.797
What the fuck are you talking about?

30:09.822 --> 30:11.721
- It's not opening.
- Oh my god.

30:11.746 --> 30:13.389
Try the front doors.

30:27.664 --> 30:29.431
Fuck!

30:29.956 --> 30:31.993
Jesus,
Knowles.

30:39.470 --> 30:42.181
- The whole place is on one system.
- You work here.

30:42.206 --> 30:44.029
- So?
- You have a key.

30:44.054 --> 30:46.359
- And why would I lock us in here?
- Open the door, Patrick.

30:46.384 --> 30:48.219
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!

30:48.244 --> 30:49.945
- I didn't do it!
- Brad stop!

30:53.077 --> 30:54.501
Rory?

31:00.313 --> 31:02.068
What...
the...

31:03.011 --> 31:05.142
- Shit. He's gone.
- Damn it.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.401
Rory!

31:12.489 --> 31:13.745
Rory.

31:17.007 --> 31:18.431
Rory?

31:54.835 --> 31:56.261
Stay back.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.565
Christ sakes.

32:02.708 --> 32:04.684
What is this?

32:23.026 --> 32:24.749
You hold him down.

32:25.181 --> 32:26.806
I'll medicate him.

32:26.831 --> 32:28.198
He's possessed.

32:28.223 --> 32:30.770
Are you seriously
that fucking stupid, man.

32:30.795 --> 32:32.955
You didn't see his face.

32:32.980 --> 32:36.612
Oh, come on. There's no such thing
as possession. Okay.

32:36.637 --> 32:39.962
That's just something that Catholics made up
to keep you guys going back for waffles

32:39.987 --> 32:42.645
This whole religion is one
big fuck up costume party.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.068
There's no God.
There's no Devil.

32:45.097 --> 32:48.001
It's idiots like you believe everything the...

32:48.026 --> 32:49.768
Holy shit!

32:54.678 --> 32:57.294
This that a sign of possession?

33:03.494 --> 33:06.087
Okay. So what kind of possession
do you think that is?

33:06.112 --> 33:07.260
What kind?

33:07.285 --> 33:10.197
Because this is saying that
not all possessions are caused by demon.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.044
but also by earth bound spirits.

33:12.069 --> 33:16.996
And this also saying that some of these verify
vicariously behaviors that mimic possession.

33:20.481 --> 33:22.531
This is a Demon.

33:23.166 --> 33:24.391
Fuck.

33:26.154 --> 33:27.836
How did it get in?

33:28.245 --> 33:35.016
It says either direct invitation or reckless attempts at rituals under
the extreme influence of mind altering substances.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.566
- Oh fuck.
- Oops.

33:40.511 --> 33:43.463
Guys, we got to get it out of him.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.133
We can drive a stake
through his heart.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.911
- He's not a  Nosferatu , you fucktard!
- Oh my god.

33:47.936 --> 33:50.829
He needs an exorcism, you assholes!
A fucking exorcism.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.429
Okay, let's do it!

33:53.693 --> 33:54.711
Are you serious?

33:54.736 --> 33:57.462
Why not? I
found a do-it-yourself site.

33:59.292 --> 34:01.599
- There you have it. [DIY EXORCISM - TEN EASY STEPS]
- Let's do it.

34:01.624 --> 34:03.261
Do you know how insane that is?

34:03.286 --> 34:05.305
Do you have a better idea.

34:07.711 --> 34:09.699
Guys, this could work!

34:09.724 --> 34:12.565
Hey, get matches and bibles, okay.
You get crucifixes.

34:12.590 --> 34:14.812
You get bubble wrap and lighter,
Knowles, you get candles okay?

34:14.837 --> 34:16.726
- Go! Hey, go!
- Remember this way.

34:16.751 --> 34:17.956
Come on, hon.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.062
- Bibles.
- Grab all those.

34:21.087 --> 34:22.712
- Okay.
- Grab all those.

34:50.703 --> 34:53.706
- What's that for?
-  Not to shake as brutal.

34:59.935 --> 35:03.362
Guys, I think that this whole
do-it-yourself exorcism guide is a joke.

35:03.388 --> 35:04.514
We have to try.

35:04.539 --> 35:05.631
You'll never pull it off.

35:05.656 --> 35:08.827
You're just a hicktown douche.
Not Father Merrin.

35:12.874 --> 35:15.153
<i>Please choose the menu.</i>

35:15.178 --> 35:16.982
<i>Start incantations now.</i>

35:17.007 --> 35:19.923
<i>The power of Christ...
compels you...</i>

35:19.948 --> 35:23.470
<i>Symptoms such as nausea
and vomiting may occur.</i>

35:23.495 --> 35:26.416
<i>"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come..."</i>

35:26.441 --> 35:29.268
<i>Do not let the Demon intimidate you.</i>

35:30.907 --> 35:33.791
The power of Christ compels you!

35:33.816 --> 35:35.826
In the likely event
of an actual levitation.

35:35.851 --> 35:39.125
A vigorous application of
holy water is recommended.

35:39.255 --> 35:44.242
Do not attempt without consulting
a professional priest first.

35:46.794 --> 35:48.168
What are you doing?

35:48.536 --> 35:51.294
Spiked mush mallow, my friend.

35:51.973 --> 35:54.768
Hey, hey.
Just one.

35:55.093 --> 35:56.413
Fuck you.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.711
Fuck you.

36:07.539 --> 36:09.198
Hey buddy.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.420
I got you some chow.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.204
Open wide.

36:19.229 --> 36:21.843
Come on.
Here you go.

36:21.991 --> 36:23.556
Eat it.

36:23.658 --> 36:25.547
See the fucking thing.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.024
Eat-
Eat it!

36:28.049 --> 36:30.697
Don't be a pussy.
Eat the fucking thing. Eat it.

36:31.494 --> 36:32.786
Fuck me!

36:33.960 --> 36:35.607
Oh...God.

36:38.674 --> 36:39.799
Are you ready?

36:39.824 --> 36:42.280
What if we use holy water?
Huh.

36:42.305 --> 36:43.496
Shit!

36:43.521 --> 36:45.798
- I forgot about that.
- I got a bottle of water.

36:45.823 --> 36:47.785
- It's gonna know, okay.
- I can put it in a cup.

36:47.810 --> 36:50.700
- It's got to be blessed by a priest.
- Not going to make a difference.

36:50.822 --> 36:52.861
- Not doing this without
the holy water, guys.
- Wait!

36:52.886 --> 36:55.421
We got a priest down there.
Can we dip his finger in it?

36:55.446 --> 36:57.009
Like a tea bag...

36:57.428 --> 36:59.111
What the fuck, Patrick!

36:59.136 --> 37:00.869
Make a hole.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.315
- Where're you going?
- You got something!

37:13.351 --> 37:14.951
He is alive.

37:15.077 --> 37:16.731
- He is alive.
- Oh my God!

37:16.756 --> 37:18.542
- He is alive.
- I thought you said he didn't have a pulse!

37:18.567 --> 37:19.804
I can swear he didn't.

37:19.829 --> 37:22.125
Oh my god.
Oh my fucking god.

37:23.390 --> 37:25.676
- Oh my god.
- You son of a bitch.

37:26.379 --> 37:27.652
You son of a bitch.

37:27.677 --> 37:29.809
Oh fuck. Oh, that's great.
That's wonderful.

37:29.834 --> 37:31.617
Oh, you're pissed off that
you committed man slaughter.

37:31.642 --> 37:34.002
Don't piss off.
'Cos he might going to the cops now, Patrick!

37:34.027 --> 37:35.878
How could he?
We are locked in.

37:35.903 --> 37:37.963
What the fuck is this?

37:38.118 --> 37:40.096
Dude.
That's holy water, man.

37:40.121 --> 37:41.829
We have to find him.

37:41.854 --> 37:42.949
Well he's gone, okay.

37:42.974 --> 37:44.457
We would see him if he was here.
He's gone.

37:44.482 --> 37:45.803
Maybe he knew a way out.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.324
- He could be bleeding to death somewhere.
- He could be pass out in one of the rooms.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.401
Oh my god. He's gone okay?
We should be gone too.

37:50.426 --> 37:52.974
- How do we know that?
- Okay, should we at least look for him?

37:58.270 --> 37:59.261
Rory.

37:59.286 --> 38:01.131
Shit!
Go.

38:06.847 --> 38:09.323
Broaden the shoulder,
you're gonna mean that shit.

38:11.255 --> 38:12.921
Rory, it's okay.

38:18.326 --> 38:20.209
Don't let it intimidate you.

38:25.973 --> 38:27.592
<i>Our Father,
Who art in heaven.</i>

38:28.083 --> 38:29.146
<i>Hallowed be Thy Name;</i>

38:29.172 --> 38:30.196
I will rise.

38:30.221 --> 38:32.719
All will die.

38:35.268 --> 38:37.688
<i>Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,</i>

38:40.588 --> 38:42.625
<i> Give us this day our daily bread,</i>

<i>and forgive us our trespasses,</i>

38:44.212 --> 38:46.010
<i>as we forgive those who trespass
Against us;</i>

38:46.035 --> 38:48.067
<i>and lead us not into temptation,</i>

<i>Save your servants!
Save me O God,</i>

38:49.974 --> 38:52.302
<i>By Thy name. By Thy might, defend my cause.</i>

38:52.327 --> 38:54.115
<i>Proud men have
Risen up against me</i>

38:54.140 --> 38:55.843
<i>and men of violence seek my life...</i>

<i>Glory be to the Father, to the Son

39:06.953 --> 39:08.407
<i>Save your servant.</i>

39:08.432 --> 39:11.131
<i>Be unto him O' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.</i>

39:11.156 --> 39:13.027
<i>Let the enemy have
No power over him.</i>

<i>The Lord sustains my life.</i>

39:14.196 --> 39:15.579
<i>In every need He has delivered me.</i>

39:15.604 --> 39:18.885
<i>Glory be to the Father, to the Son

<i>Almighty Father, everlasting God and

39:30.140 --> 39:33.215
<i>Who sent your only begotten son

39:33.240 --> 39:34.696
It worked.

<i> hasten to our call for help</i>

39:41.639 --> 39:43.417
Guys!
He's getting loose!

<i>...this human being made in

39:46.973 --> 39:49.816
<i>Strike terror Lord, into the beast,

<i> so he may no longer--

<i>The power of Christ compels you.

<i>The power of Christ compels you.

40:32.202 --> 40:33.411
Rory.

40:38.968 --> 40:40.768
- Oh god!
- Rory.

40:43.021 --> 40:44.584
Rory!
Rory!

40:44.609 --> 40:48.023
Rory!...
Rory!...

40:48.449 --> 40:49.876
Rory, wake up!

40:50.405 --> 40:52.178
- He's not breathing.
- Look at me! Rory.

40:52.203 --> 40:53.788
Let me through!
Let me through!

40:54.112 --> 40:55.273
- Yeah!
- Drew.

40:55.298 --> 40:56.386
Drew!

40:57.201 --> 40:58.403
Dude.

40:59.031 --> 41:00.716
- Dude.
- What the fuck!

41:00.741 --> 41:03.478
What're you doing man.
Get the fuck off!

41:04.043 --> 41:06.162
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

41:07.028 --> 41:08.419
Oh, he's back.

41:08.444 --> 41:10.007
Come here.

41:10.107 --> 41:13.291
Oh god, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

41:13.599 --> 41:14.893
What the fuck.

41:15.728 --> 41:17.213
It's all my fault, okay?

41:17.238 --> 41:18.870
It's all my fault.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.695
For hating me?

41:21.817 --> 41:22.945
No.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.320
No.
You think I hate you?

41:25.523 --> 41:28.143
No.
No.

41:28.168 --> 41:30.067
That is not true.
Okay.

41:30.172 --> 41:31.930
Come here.

41:33.502 --> 41:35.425
That's not true, okay.

41:40.445 --> 41:41.856
Patrick.

41:42.053 --> 41:43.343
Oh shit.

41:45.767 --> 41:47.422
Oh shit!

41:49.785 --> 41:51.396
Get him off!

41:51.798 --> 41:53.005
Knowles, look out!

41:53.030 --> 41:54.762
Aww!

41:56.263 --> 41:59.057
That little shit stabbed me
 with a fucking spoon!

41:59.082 --> 42:01.056
So how does that even happen!

42:01.081 --> 42:02.549
Get him down!

42:18.556 --> 42:21.790
- Why didn't it work?
- I don't think that cross has Jesus on it.

42:21.815 --> 42:24.756
It didn't work because you got your spit
in the holy water. You dumbfuck.

42:26.474 --> 42:28.755
It didn't work because
we got it off from YouTube.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.403
Alright.This is the most sacred ritual
in the history of mankind.

42:31.428 --> 42:33.348
And we just fucking
pissed all over it.

42:33.373 --> 42:35.004
Your idea, man.

42:35.103 --> 42:36.518
Your idea.

43:20.816 --> 43:22.157
(SPEAK
TO ME!)

43:22.575 --> 43:24.332
We're fucking dead.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.534
What the fuck does it want?

43:28.647 --> 43:30.203
It says 'Speak'.

43:30.303 --> 43:32.210
I ain't saying shit.

43:37.832 --> 43:40.997
Hey!
You got something to say?

43:41.022 --> 43:42.739
We're not afraid!

43:42.764 --> 43:45.538
- We are listening!
-  Don't, don't.

43:45.602 --> 43:48.240
No more fucking games, alright?

43:48.265 --> 43:50.779
We are sick of this shit!

43:50.804 --> 43:53.014
We are not afraid.

43:53.039 --> 43:54.060
Drew.

43:54.085 --> 43:59.386
Come out here and suck
my fat pig dick.

43:59.411 --> 44:02.305
I really consider shutting
the fuck up, Drew.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.078
See?

44:04.117 --> 44:05.945
He's a pussy.

44:09.895 --> 44:11.305
Drew!

44:15.193 --> 44:17.409
He wants to communicate.

44:17.434 --> 44:19.234
Well then, what the fuck is that?

44:19.259 --> 44:21.754
- A seance or something?
- No, no, no...

44:21.779 --> 44:23.703
You need a medium for that.

44:24.074 --> 44:26.849
We want something anyone can do.

44:26.912 --> 44:28.388
Like what?

44:54.491 --> 44:55.735
Guys, this isn't right.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.452
You're right,
the "No" should be on the left.

44:57.477 --> 45:01.072
No, no. I've heard stories about these things
and none of them had ever ended with...

45:01.097 --> 45:02.357
I'm really glad we tried that.

45:02.382 --> 45:05.546
- It's just a way to communicate.
- It wrote with blood and shit on the ceiling.

45:05.571 --> 45:07.277
He's got no problem communicating.

45:08.728 --> 45:12.473
- Stop pissing off the Demon.
- It's not a Demon.

45:13.135 --> 45:14.859
Then what is it?

45:15.312 --> 45:17.527
Let's ask.

45:19.888 --> 45:23.073
- I need a volunteer.
- I just did an exorcism.

45:23.098 --> 45:25.126
Man up, Brad.

45:26.024 --> 45:28.171
No, I'm okay.

45:33.633 --> 45:35.646
I guess I'll do it then.

45:35.835 --> 45:37.098
Okay.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.580
Brad.
Go write.

46:01.116 --> 46:03.514
Is someone with us?

46:16.747 --> 46:18.418
(YES)

46:20.513 --> 46:22.374
Oh god.

46:26.221 --> 46:27.659

46:57.387 --> 46:59.512
Who the fuck is Devon?

46:59.772 --> 47:01.810
It's that kid from the file.

47:02.939 --> 47:05.604
What file?
What fucking file?

47:07.566 --> 47:10.246

49:29.600 --> 49:31.049
Patrick, careful.

49:31.074 --> 49:33.030
Guys, he's alright.
He's alright.

49:33.061 --> 49:35.458
This is Cris Angel shit, man.

49:36.978 --> 49:38.227
Okay.

49:38.357 --> 49:40.429
I explain all this later, okay?

49:43.046 --> 49:44.715

49:47.772 --> 49:49.615

Amber.

50:41.690 --> 50:43.607

You alright, man?
Are you alright?

51:28.451 --> 51:30.134
I don't know.

51:31.392 --> 51:32.846
Are you okay?

51:32.871 --> 51:35.488
Are you fucking kidding me.
Am I okay?

51:35.513 --> 51:39.624
I almost  got shot by the local junkman.
I caught a face full of his brain and skull.

51:39.649 --> 51:41.650
We performed an exorcism!

51:41.675 --> 51:44.570
I just got stabbed in the
fucking knee with a spoon!

51:44.595 --> 51:48.054
And I just got prison shanked
by a psycho demon bitch!

51:48.079 --> 51:51.478
Aside from that!
Sweet... fucking party.

51:51.503 --> 51:53.799
Let's do it again week!

51:54.097 --> 51:55.460
Drew.

51:56.756 --> 51:57.976
Drew!

51:58.898 --> 52:02.458
Drew!

52:07.941 --> 52:09.261
Oh!

52:12.069 --> 52:13.685
Drew, watch out!

52:16.303 --> 52:18.349
Fuck!
What the fuck!

52:24.905 --> 52:26.487
Oh my god.

52:34.850 --> 52:37.641
- Hey. Where're you going?
- I'm done with this shit.

52:37.679 --> 52:39.474
- Hey, stick together!
- Brad! Brad!

52:39.531 --> 52:40.803
Fuck you!

52:40.834 --> 52:42.993
- Just let him go. Just let him go.
- You know... fuck it.

53:11.354 --> 53:13.649
Knowles.
Check these bars, alright.

53:13.674 --> 53:15.868
We're going to go upstairs.
See if there is a fire escape or something.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.619
- I got it.
- Rory, come on. Let's go.

53:17.644 --> 53:18.992
Hell no!

53:19.017 --> 53:20.003
Rory, I'm not going
to leave you here.

53:20.028 --> 53:22.292
There is no fucking way you are
dragging me back up there.

53:22.733 --> 53:24.954
Okay, sit down.
Sit down.

53:27.368 --> 53:30.973
Now look. Knowles here,
he needs your protection. okay?

53:31.229 --> 53:34.781
Now look. she comes in here,
you got to give it to here. Okay buddy?

53:35.383 --> 53:37.371
- Okay.
- Alright.

53:38.697 --> 53:41.044
Look.
I'm really sorry that this happened.

53:41.249 --> 53:42.809
It's not your fault.

53:42.834 --> 53:44.877
I should have taken you home.

53:45.429 --> 53:48.531
- Well,  I'm glad you didn't.
- Okay.

53:48.564 --> 53:50.209
- Knowles.
- Yeah.

53:50.234 --> 53:52.950
Look after him.
10 minutes.

53:57.413 --> 54:01.112
- You need my protection?
- Do something useful, fucker.

54:01.968 --> 54:05.518
- His finger.
- It's gone. There's a blood trail.

54:09.500 --> 54:12.160
- Let's go.
- Okay.

54:12.606 --> 54:13.598
Keep going.

54:13.654 --> 54:15.723
- You see it?
- Yeah.

54:16.128 --> 54:20.037
- Suck my fucking cock, the answer is no.
- Look, I'm not pissing in the sink.

54:20.062 --> 54:23.473
Piss in you boy pants again,
that worked out nice the first time.

54:36.591 --> 54:39.362
- There's more.
- Patrick, it keeps going.

54:41.699 --> 54:43.031
Okay.

54:57.691 --> 54:59.285
It's locked.

55:08.838 --> 55:10.635
Stay behind me.

55:12.096 --> 55:13.984
Th..There it is.

55:15.266 --> 55:17.230
It's pointing.

57:27.779 --> 57:30.921
- Let's go, let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

57:31.791 --> 57:33.911
Hey.
Hey.

57:34.823 --> 57:36.436
- Look.
- What?

57:36.461 --> 57:38.487
Markings.

57:53.607 --> 57:56.108
It's trying to show us something.

58:16.569 --> 58:18.754
Look over there.

58:19.571 --> 58:23.015
Fuck.
Devon.

58:33.408 --> 58:36.283
OUR LORD WILL RISE

58:47.158 --> 58:48.962
The crescent.

58:48.987 --> 58:51.620
Rory painted that on the bathroom wall.

58:55.433 --> 58:57.238
Look.

59:07.692 --> 59:09.611
This is not right.

59:11.893 --> 59:14.079
It's the only thing in here that is.

59:14.104 --> 59:16.614
So why would Devon have it.

59:22.758 --> 59:24.244
Look.

59:33.870 --> 59:35.970
That's me.

59:43.656 --> 59:47.972
I' came for help, not pain.
Help me Father.

59:47.997 --> 59:51.709
My blood is yours,
hurt no more.

59:52.516 --> 59:55.599
Conway.
Father.

59:56.035 --> 59:57.937
Right, Father Conway.

59:58.234 --> 01:00:01.523
My blood is yours.

01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:04.317
What if he's Devon's father?

01:00:04.342 --> 01:00:07.554
- There's no way.
- But it's possible.

01:00:08.215 --> 01:00:11.755
Okay, if Conway had a child.
Why would he bring it here?

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.845
- Won't his parishioners go backshit?
- Exactly.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:18.638
No.
Conway would not hurt anybody.

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:20.909
You sure?

01:00:24.075 --> 01:00:25.707
Rory.

01:00:26.604 --> 01:00:28.564
Fuck.

01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:35.750
Come on, man.

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.634
Come on, man.
Don't fuck around!

01:01:17.554 --> 01:01:19.194
Patrick!

01:01:19.219 --> 01:01:20.905
Guys!

01:02:31.326 --> 01:02:33.577
- Look. Cold air.
- What?

01:02:33.602 --> 01:02:35.658
This has to go outside.

01:02:38.215 --> 01:02:41.871
- Oh. You got to be kidding me.
- Do you want to get out or not?

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:52.684
Patrick,
I see leaves.

01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:54.677
Do you see any light?

01:03:06.904 --> 01:03:09.045
It's blocked.

01:03:09.533 --> 01:03:13.555
Hey, Patrick there's a grill,
we need a screwdriver.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:16.781
You alright?

01:03:16.806 --> 01:03:18.623
It's a cat.

01:03:21.117 --> 01:03:23.287
Fucking cat.

01:03:24.525 --> 01:03:26.284
What a cliche.

01:04:58.178 --> 01:05:00.138
Oh my.
God!

01:05:00.185 --> 01:05:01.639
Patrick!

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:25.812
Are you okay?

01:05:25.837 --> 01:05:28.175
I'm... so...
sorry...

01:05:34.159 --> 01:05:35.676
Patrick!

01:05:42.351 --> 01:05:43.273
Look out!

01:05:43.298 --> 01:05:44.908
Do it...!

01:05:55.778 --> 01:05:57.419
Mother fucker.

01:05:57.568 --> 01:06:01.156
All I wanted was a couple of beers
and a fucking blow job.

01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:03.857
And I get stuck in this bullshit.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.779
Holy shit.

01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:13.175
Yeah, shit.
That's something.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.098
Oh fuck!

01:06:15.241 --> 01:06:16.883
God damn it!

01:06:16.908 --> 01:06:18.046
Shit!

01:06:18.071 --> 01:06:19.287
Fuck.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.491
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:23.270
Jesus Christ!

01:06:23.295 --> 01:06:24.450
Fuck!

01:06:57.637 --> 01:07:00.044
Reckless child.

01:07:05.531 --> 01:07:07.224
Rest.

01:07:25.043 --> 01:07:26.447
Rory!

01:07:26.478 --> 01:07:28.723
- Knowles!
- Maybe they found a way out.

01:07:28.748 --> 01:07:30.578
No.
They wouldn't leave without us.

01:07:30.603 --> 01:07:31.909
Knowles!

01:07:31.972 --> 01:07:34.087
Patrick.
Look.

01:07:35.024 --> 01:07:36.488
Fuck!

01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:39.013
We'll find them, Patrick.

01:07:39.038 --> 01:07:40.472
Rory!

01:07:40.834 --> 01:07:42.247
Rory!

01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:46.224
Rory!

01:07:46.488 --> 01:07:48.393
Knowles' iPad.

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:53.057
I'm Ryan Knowles.

01:07:53.082 --> 01:07:54.657
If you find this.

01:07:54.682 --> 01:07:57.235
I'm probably hacked up and dead
like the rest of my friends.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.865
The crescent,
I Google it.

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:01.474
It's a Wicca sign.

01:08:01.499 --> 01:08:02.824
The summoning.

01:08:02.849 --> 01:08:05.314
True terrible things happened here.

01:08:05.339 --> 01:08:09.593
Restless souls, all brought upon us.
by someone alive.

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.038
And in this building...

01:08:16.654 --> 01:08:18.657
Knowles!
Knowles!

01:08:18.682 --> 01:08:20.041
Knowles.

01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:21.671
Knowles.

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:23.102
Get out!

01:08:32.094 --> 01:08:34.020
- Patrick!
- Give it to me!

01:08:50.245 --> 01:08:52.885
- Knowles.
- Oh my god.

01:08:53.578 --> 01:08:54.913
Patrick!

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:26.522
Patrick!
Patrick, he's dead!

01:09:29.908 --> 01:09:32.468
- Fuck.
- Patrick, basement.

01:09:33.849 --> 01:09:35.537
Rory!

01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:45.805
Wait, wait, wait...

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.224
Are you okay?

01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:52.109
Yeah, it's...
Let's go, okay.

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:05.382
Maybe it's a roary.
Rory.

01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:09.703
Rory!

01:10:11.118 --> 01:10:12.625
Rory!

01:10:30.262 --> 01:10:31.684
Rory!

01:10:54.593 --> 01:10:56.990
Wait! It's Rory!
It's Rory!

01:11:01.581 --> 01:11:04.349
Are you alright?
Hey, did Knowles did this to you?

01:11:04.381 --> 01:11:05.843
It's..
It was Conway.

01:11:05.883 --> 01:11:08.500
He's...He said it was for
my own protect or something.

01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:09.950
What are you talking about.
Conway.

01:11:09.983 --> 01:11:12.704
He was talking about the apocalypse,
the second coming.

01:11:12.729 --> 01:11:14.635
Dark entities.
That's just fuck, man.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.551
- I almost suffocated.
- Patrick, Patrick.

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:18.110
Look.

01:11:28.697 --> 01:11:30.658
Devon spelled out a box.

01:11:30.683 --> 01:11:32.634
This is got to be it.

01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:37.041
Where's the corpse?

01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:39.419
Maybe there never was a corpse.

01:11:39.444 --> 01:11:40.942
What're you talking about?

01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:43.829
This is where Devon transformed.

01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:49.288
Into what?

01:11:49.313 --> 01:11:51.013
Remember what Knowles said.

01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:52.573
The summoning.

01:11:52.598 --> 01:11:55.095
Someone can call upon souls
that were wronged,

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.024
and make them
carry out their will.

01:11:57.049 --> 01:11:59.679
While they stand there and watch.

01:12:00.059 --> 01:12:03.093
He was talking about a living person.

01:12:04.651 --> 01:12:07.632
- Where is Knowles?
- Wait.

01:12:08.113 --> 01:12:10.558
Are you saying that Devon came back to life?

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:12.890
Devon never died.

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:20.524
Can we go?

01:12:25.283 --> 01:12:27.502
Jesus.
Holy shit!

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.180
I told you Conway was alone.

01:12:32.215 --> 01:12:34.267
No.
There's no way he did this.

01:12:35.714 --> 01:12:37.600
'Cos he just locked kids up in boxes.

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:39.918
Guys.
Control room.

01:12:41.178 --> 01:12:42.963
Check this out.

01:12:50.247 --> 01:12:52.641
Oh, okay, okay.

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:56.247
Okay.
Maybe this control the locks.

01:12:56.771 --> 01:12:59.739
- Alright here, guys.
- Yeah right.

01:13:00.244 --> 01:13:01.620
Hear anything?

01:13:01.645 --> 01:13:03.944
- I'll try the windows.
- Okay, okay.

01:13:15.787 --> 01:13:17.262
Is that it?

01:13:17.287 --> 01:13:18.734
No!

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:22.221
No!

01:13:22.342 --> 01:13:23.901
That it!

01:13:33.048 --> 01:13:34.685
My child.

01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:46.231
Patrick!

01:13:47.679 --> 01:13:49.459
Patrick!

01:13:50.328 --> 01:13:53.354
Patrick!
Where are you!

01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:56.291
Patrick!

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.766
- Why won't you let me help you.
- Go. Rory. Get out of here.

01:14:01.374 --> 01:14:02.792
Let me help.
I can do this.

01:14:02.817 --> 01:14:05.563
No. Rory, come on.
God, Better go.

01:14:07.675 --> 01:14:09.258
Go, go, go.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.188
Patrick!

01:14:16.742 --> 01:14:18.445
Where are you?

01:14:29.067 --> 01:14:30.746
You okay?
Hey, what happened?

01:14:31.141 --> 01:14:34.000
What happened? What happened?
Come here.

01:14:36.436 --> 01:14:37.899
We got to get out of here, alright.

01:14:37.924 --> 01:14:39.659
Come on,
come on.

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:20.959
Stop!

01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:22.819
Stop!

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:49.583
Patrick!

01:15:55.124 --> 01:15:56.442
Hey!

01:16:10.156 --> 01:16:11.442
No!

01:16:22.998 --> 01:16:24.325
Patrick!

01:16:29.981 --> 01:16:31.304
No.
No.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.913
No, no, no.

01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:36.054
No!

01:16:41.859 --> 01:16:43.131
No, no, no...

01:16:43.156 --> 01:16:45.853
No, no, no...
Look at me, look at me. Look at me.

01:16:45.878 --> 01:16:46.712
No!

01:16:46.737 --> 01:16:48.599
Look at me!

01:17:07.242 --> 01:17:08.715
Fuck!

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:12.791
Patrick.

01:17:13.122 --> 01:17:15.937
Patrick, I had to do this to protect you.

01:17:15.962 --> 01:17:18.228
This is the only way.

01:17:30.793 --> 01:17:33.304
Slay the flock that killed the shepherd...

01:17:35.731 --> 01:17:38.164
Father.
Father.

01:17:41.061 --> 01:17:43.440
Father, look at me!

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.832
What have you done?
What have you done?

01:17:49.518 --> 01:17:51.234
Don't you understand?

01:17:51.259 --> 01:17:54.244
You have no comprehension
of what you're dealing with.

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:58.174
Devon was...
no child.

01:17:59.197 --> 01:18:01.676
Devon was a vessel of evil.

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:07.342
He was your son!

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:13.777
I have no son.

01:18:15.234 --> 01:18:17.682
No.
No.

01:18:18.612 --> 01:18:20.076
Patrick.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.900
I don't need your help!

01:18:22.925 --> 01:18:23.988
Patrick!

01:18:24.013 --> 01:18:25.172
You burn in hell!

01:18:25.197 --> 01:18:26.978
Patrick,  no!

01:18:27.795 --> 01:18:30.459
Aww...!

01:19:17.704 --> 01:19:19.984
Oh god...

01:19:26.852 --> 01:19:29.652
[D].[E].[V].[O].[N]

01:19:29.749 --> 01:19:32.559
You never even asked my name.

01:19:37.017 --> 01:19:40.821
My mother love Father Conway.

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:44.251
All she ever wanted was
someone to care.

01:19:45.123 --> 01:19:47.244
But we weren't good enough.

01:19:49.547 --> 01:19:51.583
He abandoned us.

01:19:54.021 --> 01:19:56.502
And she couldn't handle it.

01:20:01.132 --> 01:20:04.092
But I grew to accept despair.

01:20:04.117 --> 01:20:06.562
And then at 13.

01:20:06.587 --> 01:20:08.640
I came here.

01:20:08.664 --> 01:20:12.599
I thought he could save me
but he was ashamed.

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:14.869
He locked me away.

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:24.235
I survived so I could come back
to summon all those wronged.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:26.362
I let Conway live.

01:20:26.387 --> 01:20:28.615
So you could kill him.

01:20:29.506 --> 01:20:34.106
I knew he would be hurt more
by you than by me.

01:20:37.948 --> 01:20:39.314
My child.

01:20:39.339 --> 01:20:45.631
He cared more about those spoiled,
pathetic drunks than his own flesh and blood.

01:20:45.656 --> 01:20:50.183
And you were his favorite,
right up until you killed him.

01:20:50.208 --> 01:20:52.720
No, you made me do it.

01:20:53.729 --> 01:20:55.768
I didn't have to.

01:20:55.966 --> 01:20:58.518
You're just like everyone else, Patrick.

01:20:58.543 --> 01:21:02.460
You don't give a fuck who hurts
as long as it is not you.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.520
She's lying!

01:22:16.528 --> 01:22:18.303
Patrick!

01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:20.664
Patrick!

01:22:41.979 --> 01:22:43.186
Rory!

01:22:51.272 --> 01:22:53.126
More chains!

01:22:55.945 --> 01:22:57.212
Go!

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.000
This way!

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:44.712
Bitch deserved it.

01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:50.639
No, she didn't.

01:23:52.952 --> 01:23:55.518
Did I kill the junkman?

01:24:06.956 --> 01:24:09.141
Don't tell mom.
