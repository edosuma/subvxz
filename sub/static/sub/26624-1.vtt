02:50.618 --> 02:53.887
- Ms. Daigle?
- Huh! Aah.

02:53.889 --> 02:56.021
- Mr. Johnson.
- How's that brother of yours?

02:56.023 --> 02:57.990
Good.
Getting better.

02:57.992 --> 02:59.592
I dropped our friend
this morning.

02:59.594 --> 03:01.460
Yeah.

03:01.462 --> 03:03.396
I'll stop by to see
if you'll be home tomorrow

03:03.398 --> 03:05.164
so we can change out
your locks.

03:05.166 --> 03:07.700
- Why?
- A master key ring went missing.

03:07.702 --> 03:09.835
Well, can you
change them now?

03:09.837 --> 03:11.504
No, no, no, we've gotta
change the locks out

03:11.506 --> 03:12.773
on the whole floor.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.807
- Oh.
- Yeah.

03:14.809 --> 03:17.512
Nothin' for you to worry about.
We'll surely keep an eye on you.

03:19.748 --> 03:22.681
Yeah, I was wondering too

03:22.683 --> 03:25.117
if, uh, you'd given any thought
to my proposal.

03:25.119 --> 03:26.652
Yes. Yeah, I did.

03:26.654 --> 03:28.521
Um, thank you very much

03:28.523 --> 03:30.023
but I cannot switch
apartments right now.

03:30.025 --> 03:31.758
Be less expensive for you.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.592
Yeah, I know.
I appreciate it a lot.

03:33.594 --> 03:35.561
If anything changes
I'll, I'll let you know.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.962
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye, Mr. Johnson.

03:36.964 --> 03:39.034
- Thank you, thank you.
- Okay.

03:47.075 --> 03:48.978
Ann, I'm home.

03:56.752 --> 03:57.920
Ann?

04:21.476 --> 04:23.176
Hey, Brad.

04:28.517 --> 04:29.786
Brad?

04:35.089 --> 04:37.527
Hey. There he is.

04:38.659 --> 04:41.063
Hi. How was your day?

04:43.866 --> 04:47.066
Mine was okay. I think
one of my students was sick.

04:47.068 --> 04:49.102
Threw up on my shoes,
that was super fun.

04:49.104 --> 04:51.136
- No.
- No?

04:51.138 --> 04:53.008
- It's your favorite.
- Uh-uh.

04:54.542 --> 04:55.741
All right.

04:55.743 --> 04:58.177
I'm gonna leave this
right here.

04:58.179 --> 04:59.214
Mm.

05:00.916 --> 05:02.218
Maybe a little later.

05:03.217 --> 05:07.022
I have a mountain
of papers to grade.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.239
See you later then.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.618
Brad?

06:20.094 --> 06:21.794
What's wrong? Sweetie?

06:21.796 --> 06:23.862
- Aah.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

06:23.864 --> 06:26.866
Wait, let me, let me
turn the music back on.

06:26.868 --> 06:28.801
What the hell happened
to this thing?

06:35.876 --> 06:38.210
Here, here we go.

06:38.212 --> 06:40.780
See? It's all right.

06:52.928 --> 06:54.195
Ow!

06:58.734 --> 06:59.969
Mm.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.415
Brad?

08:23.952 --> 08:25.919
Brad, what's going on? Hey.

08:27.121 --> 08:28.256
Ugh!

08:31.926 --> 08:33.393
Brad, where did you get these?

08:35.063 --> 08:36.296
Brad, where did you get these?

08:38.232 --> 08:39.898
Brad, give me the keys now.

08:41.135 --> 08:43.135
Brad, give them to me,
please.

08:43.138 --> 08:44.970
Please, don't... Huh!

08:44.972 --> 08:46.873
- Aah.
- Get out!

08:46.875 --> 08:48.811
- Huh!
- Get out!

08:49.778 --> 08:51.911
Get out!

08:51.913 --> 08:54.147
Get out! Get out!

08:54.149 --> 08:56.986
Get out! Get out!

09:29.217 --> 09:30.752
Hello?

09:31.986 --> 09:33.355
Hello?

09:34.923 --> 09:36.523
I'm calling the police.

09:47.135 --> 09:48.835
No!

09:48.837 --> 09:50.903
No, please! No!

09:50.905 --> 09:53.940
No! Ugh! No!

10:23.404 --> 10:25.138
No. No!

10:25.140 --> 10:26.375
Help! Help me!

11:08.350 --> 11:10.550
Help!

11:10.552 --> 11:12.951
Help me!

11:12.953 --> 11:14.522
Help me!

12:32.232 --> 12:34.236
No!

12:36.071 --> 12:37.907
No!

13:52.547 --> 13:55.447
Hi. Uh, Phil Lodge here
to see Mr. Johnson.

13:55.449 --> 13:56.748
- I see you were here last week.
- Yes, sir.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.051
- Yeah, right over there.
- Thank you.

13:59.053 --> 14:00.787
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

14:00.789 --> 14:03.822
- Why can't I come in?
- I'm just gonna be a second.

14:03.824 --> 14:06.558
So you stay down here
with your sister, okay?

14:06.560 --> 14:08.194
Hey, Violet,
I want you to keep

14:08.196 --> 14:09.465
an eye on Rose for me, okay?

14:13.668 --> 14:15.537
Right this way.

14:16.538 --> 14:20.339
Mr. Johnson, this is Mr. Lodge.

14:20.341 --> 14:21.673
- Ahem.
- Coffee?

14:21.675 --> 14:24.509
- No, thank you.
- All right.

14:24.511 --> 14:26.446
So, Sylvi didn't tell me.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.346
How'd you hear
about the position?

14:28.348 --> 14:31.783
Uh, one of my daughters.
Her old teacher lives here.

14:31.785 --> 14:33.452
She told me about an apartment.

14:33.454 --> 14:35.287
I came to look at the place,
Sylvi told me

14:35.289 --> 14:37.190
there might be
a job available.

14:37.192 --> 14:39.260
Six years with
the Newburgh Police.

14:40.794 --> 14:42.795
And why'd you leave?

14:42.797 --> 14:44.733
Uh, my wife passed away.

14:46.701 --> 14:48.801
Oh, sorry.

14:48.803 --> 14:52.271
Loved being a cop,
but, uh, couldn't risk

14:52.273 --> 14:54.306
having my daughters grow up
without both of their parents,

14:54.308 --> 14:56.511
so here we are.

14:57.712 --> 14:58.746
Let's take a look.

15:01.816 --> 15:04.883
Ah, Bernard Shaw.

15:04.885 --> 15:08.756
Nice to see someone your age
enjoying the classics.

15:40.788 --> 15:42.354
The building was originally
the headquarters

15:42.356 --> 15:44.322
for Pete Moore
Savings and Loan

15:44.324 --> 15:46.558
until it went under
in the Depression.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.561
Depression put them
under in '33.

15:48.563 --> 15:49.862
There's more than one
sub-basement

15:49.864 --> 15:52.364
that made up
the old vault area.

15:52.366 --> 15:54.432
Place is a maze.

15:54.434 --> 15:56.569
I don't even go down there.

15:56.571 --> 15:58.537
It's off limits to tenants,
of course.

15:58.539 --> 16:00.672
Owners and high-end renters
have access to the gym

16:00.674 --> 16:02.675
the conference room,
the lounges.

16:02.677 --> 16:04.509
Get a good deal.

16:04.511 --> 16:06.845
Ah, we like to keep the more
affluent residents happy.

16:06.847 --> 16:10.582
You know, they pay very
expensive maintenance fees.

16:10.584 --> 16:12.453
Some pay for parking
in our garage.

16:14.322 --> 16:16.558
It's more than, more than
some of the tenants' rent.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.361
This way, now.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.251
Hey.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.255
Give me one of those.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.626
Thanks.

17:47.614 --> 17:48.950
Who are you?

17:50.450 --> 17:52.254
I'm Rose.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.691
You don't belong here, Rose.

18:04.832 --> 18:06.765
Well, not that
it's part of your job,

18:06.767 --> 18:10.069
but it'd be good to have someone
on staff with your experience.

18:10.071 --> 18:12.674
- Are there problems?
- No, no. Hell, no.

18:15.642 --> 18:17.376
With the low-income tenants,

18:17.378 --> 18:18.811
it's always good to have
an extra pair of eyes.

18:18.813 --> 18:20.713
I'm not familiar
with furnaces.

18:20.715 --> 18:22.715
- I'm pretty handy.
- You know what? That's good.

18:22.717 --> 18:24.516
That's, that's one of
the oldest working furnaces

18:24.518 --> 18:26.952
in all of New York City
right there.

18:26.954 --> 18:28.390
That's... Look at that.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.559
Pennsylvania Boiler Works, 1890.

18:36.831 --> 18:39.400
Yeah, don't mind
those photos over there.

18:40.634 --> 18:42.767
Those belong to Walter.

18:42.769 --> 18:45.571
Now, Walter's
our most senior super.

18:45.573 --> 18:47.606
Yeah, best to keep
an eye on him.

18:47.608 --> 18:50.975
He's into some Ukrainian
psycho voodoo shit, but...

18:50.977 --> 18:52.980
probably nothing
to get excited about.

18:54.448 --> 18:56.615
Well, this is...
There you go.

18:56.617 --> 18:58.884
Usual staff quarters
are all taken.

18:58.886 --> 19:01.623
But, uh, well,
this should do for now.

19:03.358 --> 19:05.624
I've got to call Conrad
about that.

19:05.626 --> 19:06.826
It's not much, I know.

19:06.828 --> 19:08.093
No, it's, uh...

19:08.095 --> 19:10.862
Uh, as long as
it's only temporary.

19:10.864 --> 19:12.898
Thank you for this.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.734
- Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.
- Bright and early.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.936
- 7:00, it is.
- Don't be late.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.772
How many times
do I have to tell you?

19:19.774 --> 19:22.407
I'll give these myself.

19:22.409 --> 19:25.477
I don't want you
in my apartment alone.

19:25.479 --> 19:26.981
I understand.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.716
Excuse me.
Uh, my daughters,

19:31.718 --> 19:33.619
one 14, one seven,
have you seen them?

19:33.621 --> 19:35.087
Do you mind?

19:35.089 --> 19:37.857
Excuse me, I didn't
see a seven-year-old,

19:37.859 --> 19:41.627
but I saw a teenage girl
a few minutes ago by that door.

19:41.629 --> 19:43.564
I appreciate it. Thank you.

19:44.564 --> 19:47.532
I doubt I'll still even be here
when school starts so...

19:47.534 --> 19:49.970
I don't even wanna think about
where I'm gonna go.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.938
I told you to
watch your sister.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.544
Bye.

19:58.612 --> 19:59.648
Bye.

20:04.619 --> 20:05.818
Give me the rest
of the cigarettes.

20:05.820 --> 20:07.019
He only gave me one.

20:07.021 --> 20:09.053
He only gave you one?

20:09.055 --> 20:10.491
Daddy?

20:13.060 --> 20:15.194
Hey, there you are, baby.

20:15.196 --> 20:16.898
I was looking for you.

20:18.064 --> 20:20.401
Where do I get
a ball like that, Daddy?

20:21.636 --> 20:24.169
- Ball like what?
- The one the boy had.

20:24.171 --> 20:26.571
Everything all right?

20:26.573 --> 20:28.573
It's great.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.109
- I'm Beverly.
- That's Violet.

20:31.111 --> 20:34.146
She's my oldest.
Thank you very much, by the way.

20:34.148 --> 20:35.848
Are you taking a place here?

20:35.850 --> 20:37.616
Actually, I got a job
here as the super.

20:37.618 --> 20:40.953
So, next time you see me,
I'll be in uniform.

20:40.955 --> 20:43.155
- Phil Lodge.
- Well, welcome aboard, Phil.

20:43.157 --> 20:44.893
Thank you very much.

20:49.863 --> 20:51.163
Can we leave now?

20:51.165 --> 20:54.099
- Why?
- I don't like it here.

20:54.101 --> 20:56.571
If Mommy were here,
she'd want to leave too.

20:58.104 --> 21:00.007
You're gonna like it here.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.919
Stop that.

22:47.014 --> 22:48.783
Who's in here?

22:50.016 --> 22:52.286
Don't think I won't use this.

23:00.961 --> 23:02.695
Damn it, Murphy.

23:02.697 --> 23:05.164
Boy, leave it alone.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.235
That's not for you.

23:46.707 --> 23:48.075
You all right, baby?

23:53.747 --> 23:55.115
What's wrong, baby?

24:12.832 --> 24:17.202
I'm sorry. I thought
the room was empty.

24:17.204 --> 24:19.174
Clearly it's not.

24:20.207 --> 24:23.878
Ahem. I'm Phil Lodge. Hi.

24:25.780 --> 24:28.379
I just started working here.
I live here, so...

24:28.381 --> 24:30.784
Suppose they
should've told you.

24:35.156 --> 24:37.158
Did you need anything else?

25:12.159 --> 25:14.126
Hey.

25:14.128 --> 25:15.730
What do you think
you're doing, man?

25:16.964 --> 25:20.866
No, I'm just fucking around, dude.
You can take that.

25:20.868 --> 25:23.468
You can take anything you want.
38-C moved out.

25:23.470 --> 25:25.771
She left all that.

25:25.773 --> 25:28.807
- I'm Julio.
- Phil Lodge.

25:28.809 --> 25:31.109
Hey, Phil, good to meet you.

25:31.111 --> 25:32.444
Does this happen a lot?
It's a lot of stuff.

25:32.446 --> 25:34.112
Well, you know,
some people donate stuff

25:34.114 --> 25:35.848
and some people,
they just leave it.

25:35.850 --> 25:38.117
I took a dresser.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.351
So, is this your first gig
as a super?

25:40.353 --> 25:42.387
Yeah, I used to be a cop,
actually.

25:42.389 --> 25:44.089
Well, this is gonna be
a lot less exciting.

25:44.091 --> 25:45.890
I don't mind that.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.327
Get to spend a lot more time
with my kids anyway.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.962
Vondell.

25:49.964 --> 25:51.196
Vondell!

25:51.198 --> 25:53.098
Vondell, stop with the ball.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.099
Stop with the ball,
you're scuffing up the wall.

25:55.101 --> 25:57.272
How many times
do I gotta tell you this?

25:58.339 --> 26:00.304
Fucking kid.

26:00.306 --> 26:03.509
Anyways, family
is the most important thing.

26:03.511 --> 26:06.978
- Ah, it's pretty empty, huh?
- Yeah, don't worry about that.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.316
Come Monday morning, it's gonna
be like Macy's out there.

26:12.319 --> 26:13.888
What's your name?

26:15.389 --> 26:17.092
- That's Violet.
- Hey, Violet.

26:18.391 --> 26:19.928
I'm Julio.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.931
Right, she's just quiet.

26:25.198 --> 26:26.735
See you later, sweetie.

27:29.063 --> 27:30.098
Rose?

27:31.130 --> 27:33.432
Rose? Rose?

27:33.434 --> 27:36.805
Rose! Rose!

28:06.934 --> 28:08.002
Rose?

28:11.471 --> 28:13.472
Hey!

28:13.474 --> 28:14.609
Hey.

28:18.946 --> 28:21.013
What are you doing, baby?

28:21.015 --> 28:22.950
Just looking at the flames.

28:37.331 --> 28:39.430
Just come upstairs with me.

28:39.432 --> 28:40.968
Please.

28:43.403 --> 28:45.339
How's the little one?

28:48.409 --> 28:50.477
Rose seemed lost.

28:52.612 --> 28:55.446
How do you know
my daughter's name, Walter?

28:55.448 --> 28:57.017
She told me.

29:02.188 --> 29:03.591
You spoke to my daughter?

29:04.591 --> 29:06.526
Just enough, Phil.

29:08.696 --> 29:10.628
Just head
up to 70-B, will ya?

29:10.630 --> 29:13.098
There's a faulty window.
It's off the track up there.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.099
It's gonna break
somebody's neck.

29:15.101 --> 29:18.003
We'll have a damn claim on our hand.
Cal, listen up.

29:18.005 --> 29:20.504
I'm getting complaints
about Mrs. Grey's dog yapping.

29:20.506 --> 29:23.207
She knows she can't leave that animal
alone up in there. Go check it out.

29:23.209 --> 29:24.642
Yeah, but she said
she'll have you fire me

29:24.644 --> 29:26.177
if I'm up there
when she's not home.

29:26.179 --> 29:27.611
She lived in this building
50 years

29:27.613 --> 29:29.380
payin' a $100 rent.

29:29.382 --> 29:31.015
I don't give a rat's ass
what Mrs. Grey wants.

29:31.017 --> 29:32.516
- Go check it out.
- Yes, sir.

29:32.518 --> 29:34.552
Cal.

29:34.554 --> 29:36.123
I can go up with you
if you like.

29:44.098 --> 29:45.133
Hello?

29:46.533 --> 29:47.568
Mrs. Grey?

29:52.339 --> 29:53.374
Mrs. Grey?

29:56.409 --> 29:58.342
Man, did she say
she was going away?

29:58.344 --> 30:00.244
If she did,
I'd tend her out.

30:00.246 --> 30:02.316
Come here, boy.
Get over here. Come here.

30:06.687 --> 30:08.055
Mrs. Grey?

30:11.725 --> 30:14.161
All right, put it down
and let's get out here.

30:15.428 --> 30:17.228
Oh.

30:17.230 --> 30:19.697
We can't leave him.
We should take the dog, right?

30:19.699 --> 30:21.766
This is your idea, not mine.

30:21.768 --> 30:23.036
All right.

30:29.275 --> 30:32.209
- What the hell?
- Daddy said I can have the dog.

30:32.211 --> 30:33.779
What's that thing?

30:33.781 --> 30:35.580
I think someone's
little princess outgrew it.

30:35.582 --> 30:37.385
It's just perfect for mine.

30:38.718 --> 30:40.354
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

30:44.091 --> 30:46.757
- I wish Mommy could see it.
- And I'm still on the floor?

30:46.759 --> 30:50.529
It's just for now.
I'm still on the floor too.

30:50.531 --> 30:52.531
- I'm so fucking sick of this.
- Hey, language.

30:52.533 --> 30:55.199
Everything's for Rose!
Every goddamn thing we do!

30:55.201 --> 30:57.070
Violet, wait.

31:53.794 --> 31:56.163
Mom, door.

31:57.363 --> 31:59.263
Little busy
over here, Vondell.

31:59.265 --> 32:02.303
Get your ass up
and get it. Come on.

32:35.502 --> 32:36.704
Violet, right?

32:37.704 --> 32:38.739
Yeah.

32:44.611 --> 32:47.512
You know,
I have a younger sister.

32:47.514 --> 32:49.781
She was always getting
in the way, messing up my life.

32:49.783 --> 32:52.783
There are so many times I really
thought I was gonna kill her.

32:52.785 --> 32:54.586
You know?

33:38.497 --> 33:40.500
What are you doing here?

33:48.374 --> 33:49.743
That was weird.

34:15.302 --> 34:16.370
Julio.

34:17.371 --> 34:19.840
Hey, you got
a flat-head screwdriver?

34:20.840 --> 34:22.775
Must've left it inside.

34:24.777 --> 34:26.313
Beverly.

34:29.748 --> 34:31.818
You're so athletic.

34:33.686 --> 34:36.987
My wife works for Beverly
at the Folk Art Museum.

34:36.989 --> 34:38.322
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:38.324 --> 34:39.623
Sofia reach you?

34:39.626 --> 34:41.992
Friday, 8:00 p.m.
at the terrace.

34:41.994 --> 34:44.062
Turning fuckin' 50, bro.

34:44.063 --> 34:46.996
My wife's throwing me
a birthday party to depress me.

34:46.998 --> 34:48.867
You're coming, by the way.

34:57.543 --> 35:00.547
He said someone
was at the door.

35:02.081 --> 35:05.450
- Freddy, what happened?
- Vondell Evans is missing.

35:05.452 --> 35:06.950
I mean, he pulls this crap
all the time,

35:06.952 --> 35:08.720
but usually
it's just for an hour or two.

35:08.722 --> 35:11.691
Someone has my son!

35:14.026 --> 35:15.595
Von!

35:17.463 --> 35:19.930
Julio, what do you know
about Walter?

35:19.932 --> 35:21.932
He's got those pictures
by the furnace

35:21.934 --> 35:23.702
that freak me out
every time I see them.

35:23.704 --> 35:24.903
I'm gonna see you later.

35:24.905 --> 35:27.604
If you ask me,
the place is haunted.

35:27.606 --> 35:30.642
Something down, it's gone.
Look again, it's back.

35:30.644 --> 35:32.744
Hello.

35:32.746 --> 35:33.914
Violet?

35:36.749 --> 35:37.784
Violet?

35:38.918 --> 35:41.086
What's going on?

35:41.088 --> 35:43.787
The police are looking for,
uh, Vondell,

35:43.789 --> 35:46.890
the kid you were
smoking with, uh...

35:46.892 --> 35:49.026
They don't know what happened.
He probably just ran away.

35:49.028 --> 35:52.597
Uh, I just
got a little worried.

35:52.599 --> 35:54.901
We have to look out
for each other, right?

35:57.671 --> 35:59.671
Violet, I'm so sorry.

35:59.673 --> 36:01.075
I'm sorry.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.474
Don't worry, Rose.

37:09.476 --> 37:11.445
Your father is still there.

37:15.182 --> 37:16.751
What's that?

37:17.784 --> 37:21.718
Now, this, this is Nisitas.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.588
He was tormented.

37:23.590 --> 37:26.490
So tormented,
he moved to a cave

37:26.492 --> 37:28.959
and lived as a hermit.

37:28.961 --> 37:31.562
But then Nisitas
learned to do something.

37:31.564 --> 37:33.832
Something so magic

37:33.834 --> 37:37.167
that no one
has ever done before.

37:37.169 --> 37:40.204
- What?
- He whispers.

37:40.206 --> 37:41.705
Can you hear him?

37:45.010 --> 37:49.981
You, you know what happened
to this boy, Vondell.

37:49.983 --> 37:53.251
He isn't missing.
Show me where he is.

37:53.253 --> 37:54.655
Show me.

37:55.622 --> 37:57.488
Show me where he is!

37:57.490 --> 37:59.726
Hey. Hey!

38:00.994 --> 38:02.160
What are you doing?

38:10.202 --> 38:13.740
I don't want you around
my children. Never again.

38:16.075 --> 38:18.008
Bye, bye, Rose.

38:18.010 --> 38:19.079
Baby, come on.

38:22.014 --> 38:23.450
Bye, bye.

38:43.135 --> 38:44.170
Violet?

38:48.207 --> 38:49.742
Sweetie.

38:52.044 --> 38:53.811
Sweetie.

39:09.296 --> 39:11.262
Daddy?

39:11.264 --> 39:13.601
I just saw Mommy.

39:15.235 --> 39:18.970
Mommy and I were in the garden,
and she let me use the hose,

39:18.972 --> 39:21.838
and everything that I watered
turned into flowers.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.877
They were everywhere.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.746
Go back to bed, baby.

40:04.684 --> 40:07.151
- What are you doing, Lodge?
- I'm just mopping, sir.

40:07.153 --> 40:10.021
Just do the halls. You don't need to go
in there. It's not part of your job.

40:10.023 --> 40:11.725
Yes, sir. I apologize.

40:42.956 --> 40:44.124
All right.

40:45.191 --> 40:46.990
Violet.

40:46.992 --> 40:49.697
Give it a chance, okay?
You might have a good time.

40:52.731 --> 40:53.930
What do you think?

40:53.932 --> 40:56.267
With or with no
chocolate frosting?

40:56.269 --> 40:59.202
- There's the man.
- Hey.

40:59.204 --> 41:01.104
- I'm Sofia, Julio's wife.
- Phil. Nice to meet you.

41:01.106 --> 41:02.340
- Nice meeting you.
- Happy birthday, sir.

41:02.342 --> 41:04.242
- Oh, thanks, man.
- Oh, all right.

41:04.244 --> 41:05.977
- Thank you so much.
- My kids.

41:05.979 --> 41:07.648
- Hector and Diego.
- Hey, Hector.

41:10.383 --> 41:11.916
Julio said you have two.

41:11.918 --> 41:14.053
Violet right here,
this is my oldest.

41:15.287 --> 41:17.220
Little sister Rose is...

41:17.222 --> 41:19.856
run off to find
some fun somewhere, I guess.

41:19.858 --> 41:21.425
Hey, you want something to eat?

41:21.427 --> 41:24.364
Uh, yeah.
Violet, you hungry?

42:23.155 --> 42:25.159
Who is that?

42:29.162 --> 42:31.329
So, Violet,

42:31.331 --> 42:33.330
what do you think
of Beverly?

42:35.068 --> 42:37.334
I wanted to stay at the party.

42:37.336 --> 42:39.472
Mommy would've let me stay.

42:44.510 --> 42:46.811
- Violet?
- What do you care?

42:46.813 --> 42:50.718
Why did we have to leave?
Other people got to stay.

42:51.483 --> 42:53.453
I know.

43:01.961 --> 43:04.528
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

43:04.530 --> 43:06.733
- Smells bad.
- What does, sweetie?

43:11.336 --> 43:13.171
Rose. Rose.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.805
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

43:14.807 --> 43:16.443
I don't like it, Daddy.

43:19.311 --> 43:20.346
It's all wet.

43:29.421 --> 43:31.088
Dad.

43:31.090 --> 43:33.160
I'll be right back.

43:55.048 --> 43:58.316
Hey. Did they find Vondell?

43:58.318 --> 44:00.387
Johnson doesn't like things
on the walls.

44:07.894 --> 44:09.530
I know you were
in my apartment, Walter.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.466
I'm gonna have to kill you,
all right?

44:16.468 --> 44:19.039
Uh... Uh...

44:22.041 --> 44:25.609
Phil. Hey, Phil.
What's going on, guys?

44:29.249 --> 44:30.951
Hey, are you okay?

44:35.588 --> 44:37.454
Wouldn't worry
too much about Walter.

44:37.456 --> 44:40.191
He told me that
after his wife died

44:40.193 --> 44:41.992
every night at dinnertime

44:41.994 --> 44:45.028
he'd see her sitting
across the table from him.

44:48.501 --> 44:50.267
I thought it was
kind of romantic.

44:50.269 --> 44:51.604
Huh, yeah.

44:54.340 --> 44:56.039
You have a strange sense
of romance.

44:56.041 --> 44:58.110
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:59.077 --> 45:00.644
Well, after my college boyfriend
proposed to me,

45:00.646 --> 45:03.314
- I couldn't stop laughing.
- You laughed at him?

45:03.316 --> 45:06.149
Then he called me a mental
patient, and that was that.

45:06.151 --> 45:08.184
Don't worry,
it's not like I'm gonna...

45:08.186 --> 45:10.223
come after you
with a knife or anything.

45:28.974 --> 45:32.178
Hey, um, I should get going.

45:34.447 --> 45:36.349
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

45:37.383 --> 45:40.383
Well, it's... Um...

45:40.385 --> 45:43.254
Just... Put your deadbolt on.

45:43.256 --> 45:44.491
Okay.

46:22.327 --> 46:23.596
Phil?

47:16.749 --> 47:19.249
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of
the color of these walls though.

47:19.251 --> 47:21.352
I love this building.
It has such a good vibe.

47:21.354 --> 47:23.053
Well, the building
was really the headquarters

47:23.055 --> 47:24.555
of Pete Moore
Savings and Loan

47:24.557 --> 47:27.624
till it went under in
the Depression in 1933.

47:27.626 --> 47:29.660
Look at this.

47:29.662 --> 47:31.195
That's her.

47:31.197 --> 47:33.363
- That's the teacher.
- I know her.

47:33.365 --> 47:35.499
That's Violet's
favorite teacher.

47:35.501 --> 47:37.734
She was the one that told me
how much she loved this place.

47:37.736 --> 47:41.271
- Why would she move out?
- Family emergency.

47:41.273 --> 47:43.209
People split all the time.

47:49.514 --> 47:51.583
That's blood, man.

47:55.454 --> 47:57.320
Mr. Johnson?

47:57.322 --> 48:00.356
Can I show you something?

48:00.358 --> 48:02.361
Look at this. That's blood.

48:19.412 --> 48:20.778
You do some
maintenance too, huh?

48:20.780 --> 48:22.745
Huh! So you like it?

48:22.747 --> 48:24.747
- Yeah, we'll take it.
- Well, that's good.

48:24.749 --> 48:27.751
We have three terraces,
a roof garden, and a gym,

48:27.753 --> 48:29.423
conference room, lounge.

48:30.789 --> 48:32.592
I have something
I think I should show you.

48:53.813 --> 48:55.347
Hello?

48:57.383 --> 48:59.386
Excuse me.
The elevator's stuck.

49:12.631 --> 49:14.832
It makes perfect sense
that it's Johnson.

49:14.834 --> 49:16.834
We don't know that yet.

49:16.836 --> 49:19.639
But he was acting weird
around this room.

49:21.307 --> 49:23.707
You get the old rent-control
tenants out,

49:23.709 --> 49:25.145
prices skyrocket.

49:31.217 --> 49:32.686
There's nothing in here, bro.

49:36.822 --> 49:38.157
What?

49:52.939 --> 49:54.771
I don't know
if he's a murderer,

49:54.773 --> 49:57.476
but... he's
definitely a pervert.

50:03.282 --> 50:05.282
<i>Hello. The
elevator isn't moving.</i>

50:05.284 --> 50:07.787
<i>Excuse me. Hello!</i>

50:39.584 --> 50:40.619
Hello?

50:45.423 --> 50:46.458
Shit!

51:55.593 --> 51:58.796
You're so stubborn.
You would not listen.

51:58.798 --> 52:00.597
You are gonna re...

52:00.599 --> 52:02.099
Get away from me! Get away!

52:02.101 --> 52:03.535
No!

52:28.626 --> 52:30.693
No! Get off! No!

52:30.695 --> 52:31.928
Hey, what's wrong?

52:31.930 --> 52:34.398
Hey, what's wrong?

52:34.400 --> 52:35.832
- This is your fault!
- What's my fault?

52:35.834 --> 52:37.568
This would've never happened
if Mom was here!

52:37.570 --> 52:39.570
Maybe I wouldn't have creepy,
fucking old men

52:39.572 --> 52:42.004
chasing me around basements.

52:42.006 --> 52:43.376
What's going on?

52:46.778 --> 52:49.349
I'm taking this guy down
right now!

52:58.057 --> 53:00.360
What are you doin', man?
What are you doin'?

53:01.660 --> 53:02.792
Dude, she needs that
to get around.

53:02.794 --> 53:04.495
Exactly.

53:04.497 --> 53:06.829
She's not away.
Something happened to her.

53:06.831 --> 53:08.599
The same thing
that happened to Vondell.

53:08.601 --> 53:09.966
The same thing that's gonna
happen to my kids

53:09.968 --> 53:11.702
unless I do something
about this.

53:11.704 --> 53:14.671
What if it was your kids
he was threatening?

53:14.673 --> 53:16.606
Dude, planting evidence?

53:16.608 --> 53:18.441
Make an anonymous call.

53:18.443 --> 53:20.510
They'll talk to him,
they'll get a warrant.

53:20.512 --> 53:21.912
I promise you,

53:21.914 --> 53:23.012
they'll find plenty
of real evidence

53:23.014 --> 53:24.583
on their own.

54:23.776 --> 54:25.412
He's coming, he's coming,
he's coming.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.082
Hey, Walter.

54:33.151 --> 54:36.486
- Sofia's looking for you. There's a leak in 12-B.
- So fix it.

54:36.488 --> 54:38.622
It's no secret they think
I'm a shitty plumber.

54:38.624 --> 54:39.990
Johnson's office
is right below it, please.

54:39.992 --> 54:42.024
We don't want that stuff
leaking through.

54:42.026 --> 54:43.994
- I don't have my tools...
- Can you just get 'em, Walter?

54:43.996 --> 54:46.566
And do me a solid, please?

54:48.501 --> 54:49.535
No.

54:59.177 --> 55:00.746
I owe you, Walter.

55:08.887 --> 55:10.823
Don't fuckin' do that!

55:11.856 --> 55:13.625
Now fuckin' what?

55:15.193 --> 55:17.130
We make an anonymous call.

55:43.622 --> 55:46.990
When was the last time you saw
the tenant in 15-H, Mrs. Grey?

55:46.992 --> 55:50.160
Oh, I, I got hundreds
of tenants, you know.

55:50.162 --> 55:53.564
She could be in the park, or she's
shopping, she's riding a bike.

55:53.566 --> 55:54.698
Who knows?

55:54.700 --> 55:55.832
Listen.

55:55.834 --> 55:57.066
Do me a favor.

55:57.068 --> 55:59.005
If you hear something,
give me a call.

56:07.912 --> 56:10.646
When I was 12,
my mother had an affair.

56:10.648 --> 56:13.816
And... my dad had
all these connections,

56:13.818 --> 56:15.251
so he managed to get custody

56:15.253 --> 56:19.356
and basically...
cut her out of our lives.

56:19.358 --> 56:20.827
Ugh!

56:22.126 --> 56:23.794
Sorry to hear that.

56:23.796 --> 56:25.361
I was a little younger
than Violet,

56:25.363 --> 56:28.668
so I know what it's like
to act out at her age.

56:30.035 --> 56:32.736
Ah, Violet...

56:32.738 --> 56:36.006
I'm the bad guy right now.
She blames me for everything.

56:36.008 --> 56:38.244
Which I don't really
fault her for, 'cause...

56:39.211 --> 56:41.144
I blame myself.

56:41.146 --> 56:42.247
For what?

56:47.919 --> 56:49.555
There was a fire.

56:52.858 --> 56:56.727
And my wife was stuck upstairs.

56:56.729 --> 56:59.329
The floor collapsed. I was able
to get Rose and myself out,

56:59.331 --> 57:01.968
but I wasn't able
to reach her.

57:04.869 --> 57:06.003
What about Violet?

57:06.005 --> 57:08.171
Uh, she was in the yard.

57:08.173 --> 57:09.609
Thank God for that.

57:11.276 --> 57:14.781
So Violet,
when her mom died...

57:15.947 --> 57:18.250
she wanted
everything else dead too.

57:21.253 --> 57:22.722
I'm sorry.

57:33.731 --> 57:35.233
You're a good dad.

59:20.939 --> 59:25.341
Hey.
Why did they let him go?

59:25.343 --> 59:26.943
He didn't know how
the old lady's cane handle

59:26.945 --> 59:28.448
ended up in the dresser.

59:31.282 --> 59:33.350
They're not even convinced
the old lady is missing.

59:33.352 --> 59:35.050
They also didn't find
anything else

59:35.052 --> 59:36.888
when they searched
his place, Phil.

01:00:11.889 --> 01:00:14.390
You can't protect them.

01:00:14.392 --> 01:00:16.428
I'm coming for them.

01:00:19.131 --> 01:00:20.399
- Uh!
- Dad?

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.235
You all right?

01:00:24.269 --> 01:00:26.272
Yeah.

01:00:28.006 --> 01:00:30.207
What are you doing up?

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:34.013
I heard you and thought you were
having a bad dream or something.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.889
Come here.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.229
You are a good kid.

01:01:23.928 --> 01:01:25.430
Are you okay, bro?

01:01:26.965 --> 01:01:28.999
Yeah.

01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:30.269
I'm not getting much sleep.

01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:32.936
I guess with Walter back,

01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:35.006
I'm just kind of freaking out.

01:01:38.343 --> 01:01:40.246
Hey, you seen
Phil and Julio?

01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:45.916
Hello? Walter?

01:01:56.595 --> 01:01:59.296
Are you guys looking
at the work screen or what?

01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:00.930
I've been texting you
all morning.

01:02:00.932 --> 01:02:03.466
38-C has a problem
with the lock.

01:02:03.468 --> 01:02:05.702
- I got it. I got it.
- Phil's taking it.

01:02:05.704 --> 01:02:07.606
You want the job,
don't you, Phil?

01:02:10.275 --> 01:02:12.043
- You keep an eye on her.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:02:17.282 --> 01:02:19.048
Maybe I should go
help him with the lock.

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.649
- You're not going anywhere.
- Oh.

01:02:35.968 --> 01:02:37.970
<i>I'm watchin' the kids.</i>

01:02:56.121 --> 01:02:58.655
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:02:58.657 --> 01:03:01.091
Uh, the office said that you

01:03:01.093 --> 01:03:02.559
had a problem
with one of your locks.

01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:04.660
Yeah, I woke up,
and they were all unlocked.

01:03:04.662 --> 01:03:07.329
- The deadbolts and everything.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:09.131
Can you please
just put some clothes on?

01:03:09.133 --> 01:03:11.300
I'm sorry to drag you up here.

01:03:11.302 --> 01:03:13.269
She just stumbled in
really late last night.

01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:15.271
I did not
stumble, I never stumble.

01:03:15.273 --> 01:03:16.673
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.401
Julio? Julio?

01:03:45.403 --> 01:03:48.037
Violet? Are you all right?

01:03:48.039 --> 01:03:51.106
- Where's Julio?
- He left.

01:03:51.108 --> 01:03:53.609
Where's Rose, Violet?

01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:55.380
- Where's Rose?
- You know where she is.

01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:18.437
Something reeks.

01:04:24.108 --> 01:04:25.707
Smells just like Rose's bed.

01:04:25.709 --> 01:04:28.611
Hey, listen, you go back,
and you lock the door.

01:04:28.613 --> 01:04:31.150
- Okay? Okay?
- Fine.

01:04:47.765 --> 01:04:49.434
You're fine, baby.

01:05:22.267 --> 01:05:23.702
Hey, sweetie.

01:05:25.302 --> 01:05:27.072
Puppy, don't go. Puppy.

01:05:52.164 --> 01:05:53.832
Hello, Phil.

01:05:56.601 --> 01:06:00.836
The knowledge has been
passed down for generations.

01:06:00.838 --> 01:06:03.439
Nisitas was the first.

01:06:03.441 --> 01:06:07.776
With a great fire,
he summoned the unwanted souls.

01:06:07.778 --> 01:06:10.546
He forged a chain

01:06:10.548 --> 01:06:12.782
and sent back the cursed ones

01:06:12.784 --> 01:06:14.716
from where they came.

01:06:14.718 --> 01:06:16.653
Where is she, Walter?

01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:19.658
He protected us from the dead.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.660
Now it is me
who must protect us.

01:06:24.662 --> 01:06:26.863
Where is she? Where is she?

01:06:26.865 --> 01:06:29.832
- Where is she?
- Where is she?

01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:31.667
Dad?

01:06:31.669 --> 01:06:33.836
Where is she?
Where?

01:06:40.311 --> 01:06:41.744
Where is she?

01:06:43.615 --> 01:06:47.350
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?

01:07:04.401 --> 01:07:05.905
Tell me where she is.

01:07:07.338 --> 01:07:09.340
Give her back to me!

01:07:10.407 --> 01:07:11.643
Coming.

01:07:12.876 --> 01:07:13.910
Violet.

01:07:13.912 --> 01:07:15.414
Can I come in?

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.815
Yeah.

01:07:56.954 --> 01:07:58.590
Daddy?

01:08:02.593 --> 01:08:03.695
Oh, God!

01:08:05.796 --> 01:08:08.030
I was really worried about you.
Where were you, baby?

01:08:08.032 --> 01:08:10.432
I heard the bad person.

01:08:10.434 --> 01:08:13.068
So I ran away.
He was chasing me.

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:14.672
I'm glad you're okay.

01:08:23.982 --> 01:08:26.615
Hey, I was just about
to call you.

01:08:26.617 --> 01:08:28.383
<i>Julio...</i>

01:08:28.385 --> 01:08:30.551
Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

01:08:30.554 --> 01:08:32.020
<i>I fucked up.</i>

01:08:32.022 --> 01:08:33.988
<i>I fucked up so bad.</i>

01:08:33.991 --> 01:08:36.828
Hey, man, what's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.332
Mr. Johnson,

01:08:44.335 --> 01:08:45.903
you're not gonna like this.

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.407
Let me call you back.

01:08:55.346 --> 01:08:57.546
I thought he had my baby,
and I...

01:08:57.549 --> 01:08:59.413
I just wanted him to tell me
where she was.

01:08:59.416 --> 01:09:01.019
I just couldn't stop.

01:09:02.353 --> 01:09:03.388
Okay.

01:09:06.023 --> 01:09:07.292
Where is he?

01:09:14.866 --> 01:09:16.966
He was right here.

01:09:16.968 --> 01:09:18.703
Yeah?

01:09:20.437 --> 01:09:21.673
You lost him?

01:09:22.773 --> 01:09:24.841
Phil, look at me.

01:09:24.843 --> 01:09:26.077
Phil.

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.913
What's going on with you, man?

01:09:33.384 --> 01:09:35.420
Why was this in your apartment?

01:09:42.126 --> 01:09:43.562
That's mine.

01:09:45.863 --> 01:09:47.629
Who are you?

01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:50.499
I'm Rose.

01:09:50.501 --> 01:09:53.002
I don't think I've ever
met you before, Rose.

01:09:53.004 --> 01:09:57.009
Most people don't see me
until it's their time.

01:10:46.523 --> 01:10:47.892
He was my friend.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.696
He found out.

01:10:51.795 --> 01:10:53.965
They'd take you away from us.

01:10:55.933 --> 01:10:57.869
That's my sister.

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:01.506
She's the cute one.

01:11:05.108 --> 01:11:07.646
- You know, I think it helps...
- Don't try to be my mom.

01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:11.550
I'm not your mom, Violet.

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:22.193
I want to show you something.

01:11:25.662 --> 01:11:26.799
This is Rose.

01:11:36.707 --> 01:11:38.143
Mr. Lodge?

01:11:39.844 --> 01:11:41.079
Mr. Lodge?

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.980
Walter was right about you,
Mr. Lodge.

01:11:44.982 --> 01:11:49.185
When I rehired him, he suggested
you falsified your resume.

01:11:49.187 --> 01:11:51.122
Newburgh Police
has no record...

01:11:52.756 --> 01:11:54.226
no record of you.

01:11:56.794 --> 01:11:59.031
There must be some mistake.

01:12:03.034 --> 01:12:04.169
Oh, no.

01:12:05.202 --> 01:12:08.003
No! No!

01:12:08.005 --> 01:12:09.207
No!

01:12:12.977 --> 01:12:14.079
She's cute.

01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:17.078
You know,
I've never actually met her.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.851
That was just before
the funeral.

01:12:23.086 --> 01:12:25.557
- And that's Rose?
- No, that's me.

01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:29.758
You looked a lot like her.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.629
That was taken seven years ago.

01:13:09.267 --> 01:13:10.702
- Daddy.
- No.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.680
- Violet, I don't understand.
- This is where we grew up.

01:13:24.682 --> 01:13:26.748
Burned down on our birthday.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:29.651
You and Rose
have the same birthday?

01:13:29.653 --> 01:13:31.022
Of course we do.

01:13:32.756 --> 01:13:33.791
We're twins.

01:13:38.929 --> 01:13:40.962
I'm a few minutes older.

01:13:40.964 --> 01:13:44.699
You and Rose can't be twins.
Phil said she's only seven.

01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:46.735
No, we were both seven.

01:13:46.737 --> 01:13:48.971
We were both seven
the day she died.

01:13:48.973 --> 01:13:51.707
She can't be dead.
Phil talks about her.

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:52.945
He sees her.

01:13:54.379 --> 01:13:57.145
He sees her, and that weird
janitor Walter sees her

01:13:57.147 --> 01:13:59.116
ever since we moved here, and...

01:14:04.388 --> 01:14:05.820
You'll see her too.

01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:18.003
Whoa!

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.646
No. Oh, God!

01:14:31.915 --> 01:14:33.351
Please.

01:14:38.455 --> 01:14:43.458
Oh, my God!
Please. Oh, no. No! No!

01:15:01.778 --> 01:15:03.412
Daddy?

01:15:03.414 --> 01:15:05.717
Violet's telling.

01:15:08.219 --> 01:15:10.185
Rose always did
whatever she wanted,

01:15:10.187 --> 01:15:12.387
and no one ever
did anything about it.

01:15:12.389 --> 01:15:15.990
My favorite teacher,
Ms. Daigle, did you know her?

01:15:15.992 --> 01:15:19.028
She used to live here
until Rose got to her.

01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:22.163
We were friends.
That's all it took.

01:15:22.165 --> 01:15:25.501
I had a picture of Vondell,
I never got one of Mrs. Grey.

01:15:25.503 --> 01:15:27.238
I think Rose
just wanted her dog.

01:15:29.339 --> 01:15:31.140
It's been happening like this
ever since she died,

01:15:31.142 --> 01:15:33.010
and I don't think
she can be stopped.

01:15:35.912 --> 01:15:38.784
- I don't understand what...
- Don't you get it?

01:15:40.485 --> 01:15:42.120
She's evil.

01:15:45.388 --> 01:15:47.256
Hey, Phil.
Have you seen Julio?

01:15:47.258 --> 01:15:49.728
His phone is off,
and I can't seem to find him.

01:15:51.362 --> 01:15:54.296
You're not covering
for my husband, are you, Phil?

01:15:54.298 --> 01:15:57.102
I mean, I know
the kind of man...

01:16:08.545 --> 01:16:10.412
Phil?

01:16:10.414 --> 01:16:13.481
Carol, he's up on the...

01:16:13.483 --> 01:16:15.720
on the roof fixing a railing.

01:16:19.122 --> 01:16:21.125
Give him that
when you see him.

01:16:31.134 --> 01:16:33.472
Rose set the fire
that burned the house down?

01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:38.210
It was all because Mom
wanted to punish Rose.

01:16:40.311 --> 01:16:41.577
For all she's done.

01:16:41.579 --> 01:16:44.113
Rose burned down the house.

01:16:44.115 --> 01:16:46.785
I didn't know my mother was home.
I swear I didn't.

01:16:49.586 --> 01:16:51.756
Violet told Daddy what I did.

01:16:52.924 --> 01:16:54.923
So he broke my neck

01:16:54.925 --> 01:16:56.458
and threw me
out of a window.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.097
How did you get in here?

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.498
You see her, don't you?

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.504
- Daddy knows what Violet said.
- We have to get out of here.

01:17:10.241 --> 01:17:12.106
Why are we doing this?

01:17:12.108 --> 01:17:14.142
If you saw Rose, it means
my dad's not far behind.

01:17:14.144 --> 01:17:15.179
I don't understand.

01:17:19.383 --> 01:17:21.283
Shit!

01:17:21.285 --> 01:17:23.455
- Hello, Beverly.
- Rose?

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:30.195
Beverly, I'm sorry.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.842
Phil?

01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:50.948
I'm sorry.

01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:56.987
Run! No! No!

01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:11.870
- Wait.
- Let's go this way!

01:18:13.937 --> 01:18:15.339
There's no way out.

01:18:22.079 --> 01:18:23.948
Daddy!

01:18:43.534 --> 01:18:46.170
Rose...

01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:51.340
- What are you...
- No! You can't touch her!

01:18:51.342 --> 01:18:53.042
- Violet...
- You can't.

01:19:04.487 --> 01:19:07.056
- What are you doing?
- Aah!

01:19:07.058 --> 01:19:08.724
Get off of her!

01:19:08.726 --> 01:19:11.060
You do not touch her.

01:19:11.062 --> 01:19:12.962
You can't.
He's getting rid of her.

01:19:17.067 --> 01:19:18.734
Daddy!

01:19:23.974 --> 01:19:26.044
- She's just a child. What...
- No, she's not!

01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:41.660
Violet, help me!

01:19:45.028 --> 01:19:47.131
Daddy!

01:20:00.777 --> 01:20:03.347
Daddy, Daddy, help me.

01:20:07.518 --> 01:20:09.354
You're okay.
It's okay.

01:20:11.455 --> 01:20:12.624
It's okay.

01:20:27.772 --> 01:20:29.006
Phil.

01:20:30.473 --> 01:20:32.043
Phil.

01:20:35.478 --> 01:20:41.052
I'm trying to save you, Phil.

01:21:28.598 --> 01:21:31.499
No. Phil, you don't
have to do this.

01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:33.368
Please.

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:34.738
Daddy, wait.

01:21:39.643 --> 01:21:41.813
You know what
I really want?

01:21:51.222 --> 01:21:52.657
A mommy.

01:22:28.659 --> 01:22:30.892
- What do I do?
- Just do what she says,

01:22:30.894 --> 01:22:32.560
and it's okay.

01:22:32.562 --> 01:22:34.131
Are we done, baby?

01:22:35.198 --> 01:22:36.731
No, Daddy.

01:22:36.733 --> 01:22:38.236
We're just getting started.
