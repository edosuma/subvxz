WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:15.234
We have a successful launch.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.434
a general

00:16.501 --> 00:18.267
in our central command...

00:18.334 --> 00:21.300
General Mohmar Habib, who has
also been in contact with Fayed.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.634
He's been helping orchestrate
the attacks on your country.

00:23.701 --> 00:26.167
I really hope protecting this
man was worth pushing us

00:26.234 --> 00:28.667
to the brink of World War III.

00:30.901 --> 00:33.467
I've never found pharmaceutical
torture all that affective.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.100
I have.

00:35.167 --> 00:36.567
If this is supposed
to frighten me,

00:36.634 --> 00:38.501
you're wasting your time.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.067
<i>I won't tell you a thing.</i>

00:40.133 --> 00:41.334
Watch out !

00:44.634 --> 00:48.067
<i>We staged a fake rescue
of Fayed by CTU agents</i>

00:48.133 --> 00:50.000
<i>posing as members
of a terrorist cell</i>

00:50.067 --> 00:51.200
<i>with loyalties to Habib.</i>

00:51.267 --> 00:53.534
He wants us to help you
rendezvous with your men.

00:53.601 --> 00:55.133
Where do you want us
to take you ?

00:55.200 --> 00:57.467
If you take your orders
from General Habib as I do,

00:57.534 --> 00:59.334
how is it
I've never heard of you ?

01:01.434 --> 01:02.801
Fayed's gone !

01:02.868 --> 01:04.700
Jamal's still alive.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.234
Stay with him, call in a medic.

01:44.884 --> 01:46.950
CTU, the bombs are secure.

01:47.017 --> 01:49.083
Hello ?

01:49.150 --> 01:51.551
Jack, are you there ?

01:51.617 --> 01:52.751
Can you hear me ?

01:52.818 --> 01:54.117
Audrey.

01:54.184 --> 01:56.350
Help me, Jack.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.250
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive.

01:59.317 --> 02:01.184
If you wish her
to remain that way,

02:01.250 --> 02:02.983
you will call me back
in ten minutes.

02:03.050 --> 02:05.217
If you make any attempt

02:05.284 --> 02:06.751
to find our location, she dies.

02:06.818 --> 02:08.517
Cheng.

02:19.517 --> 02:22.184
Agent Bauer, you really do
need to get to a hospital.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.651
But I understand
the circumstances.

02:24.717 --> 02:26.651
At least this will
help you with the pain.

02:26.717 --> 02:28.217
Thank you.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.851
Hey, Jack, so the
Marines, they're going
to secure the nukes

02:39.918 --> 02:41.451
and prepare them
for transport.

02:41.517 --> 02:43.551
They're calling
the shots now.
The military's taking over ?

02:43.617 --> 02:45.250
Yeah, according
to presidential order.

02:45.317 --> 02:46.983
I guess DOD doesn't want
CTU in charge anymore.

02:47.050 --> 02:49.684
So Buchanan, he wants you
to call him as soon as

02:49.751 --> 02:51.784
the nukes are ready for
transport to a NEST facility.

02:51.851 --> 02:53.551
Can you handle that for me ?
Sure.

02:56.184 --> 02:57.250
Jack ?

02:57.317 --> 03:00.684
What ?

03:00.751 --> 03:02.317
I just... I know you've
been through hell.

03:02.384 --> 03:05.784
Not just today, but
the last couple of years, and...

03:05.851 --> 03:08.083
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did today,

03:08.150 --> 03:10.451
'cause it could have ended
a hell of a lot worse.

03:10.517 --> 03:12.417
And it would have
if you weren't here.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.517
I appreciate that.

03:15.584 --> 03:17.117
Excuse me.

03:17.184 --> 03:20.250
Agent Doyle, Highway
Patrol's finished locking
down all the roads,

03:20.317 --> 03:22.284
and they're awaiting
your instructions.

03:42.918 --> 03:43.950
Yes.

03:44.017 --> 03:46.484
This is Bauer,
let me speak to Audrey.

03:46.551 --> 03:47.651
You've already spoken to her.

03:47.717 --> 03:50.050
I want to make sure
she's all right.

03:50.117 --> 03:53.584
Her well-being is entirely
up to you, Mr. Bauer.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.083
Everyone has given
up on you.

03:55.150 --> 03:58.017
Everyone, except
for Ms. Raines.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.684
Over the objections
of your government, her family,

04:00.751 --> 04:01.950
her friends,

04:02.017 --> 04:05.517
she came to Beijing,
just to find you.

04:05.584 --> 04:07.884
Since you proved to be
a uncooperative prisoner,

04:07.950 --> 04:10.284
we felt she would be an asset

04:10.350 --> 04:12.884
we might be able
to exploit one day.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.317
And that day is here.

04:15.384 --> 04:16.884
I will hand myself over to you.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.050
Tell me where.

04:19.117 --> 04:23.983
A man who won't break
is of no use to us,

04:24.050 --> 04:26.651
but the Russian suitcase
nukes you captured...

04:26.717 --> 04:28.751
Why ?

04:28.818 --> 04:31.150
Your country has the technology
to build those weapons.

04:31.217 --> 04:34.017
It's not the weapons themselves
we're interested in.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.884
What we want is a component
from the triggering mechanism.

04:37.950 --> 04:41.918
It contains a prototype
algorithm...

04:41.983 --> 04:44.517
old enough to be free of any
modern decryption safeguards.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.117
With it,

04:46.184 --> 04:51.417
we'll have access to virtually
all Russian defense technology.

04:51.484 --> 04:54.551
It's a simple exchange.

04:54.617 --> 04:57.717
You give me the component,
I give you Audrey.

04:57.784 --> 05:00.317
If you refuse, I kill her.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.851
The Russians will know that we

05:01.918 --> 05:03.484
supplied you with the algorithm.

05:03.551 --> 05:05.050
You would be
starting World War III.

05:05.117 --> 05:08.884
I suggest we leave that
to the diplomats to sort out.

05:08.950 --> 05:12.083
Even if I wanted to, the bombs
are under military control.

05:12.150 --> 05:13.584
I couldn't get
anywhere near them.

05:13.651 --> 05:15.184
You'll find a way.

05:19.350 --> 05:22.384
If I'm going to agree to this,
I want to speak to Audrey now.

05:22.451 --> 05:24.651
Very well.

05:28.384 --> 05:31.250
Speak to him.

05:37.050 --> 05:38.050
Jack ?

05:38.117 --> 05:41.017
Audrey.
Are you all right ?

05:41.083 --> 05:41.983
Did they hurt you ?

05:42.050 --> 05:42.983
No.

05:43.050 --> 05:43.983
Jack... I...

05:44.050 --> 05:45.050
I'm sorry.

05:45.117 --> 05:47.884
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

05:47.950 --> 05:50.384
The only thing that's important
is that you're alive.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.083
I know what
they're asking for.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.784
I can handle it.

05:54.851 --> 05:57.050
I promise you, I'm going
to get you out of there.

05:57.117 --> 05:58.617
Just don't be frightened.

05:58.684 --> 06:00.784
You have one hour
to call this number

06:00.851 --> 06:01.950
when you're ready
to make the exchange.

06:02.017 --> 06:04.083
An hour's not going
to give me enough time.

06:04.150 --> 06:05.217
Cheng.

06:05.284 --> 06:06.684
Cheng !

06:38.284 --> 06:41.851
You know, you really should
work from Medical, sir.

06:41.918 --> 06:44.083
Come on, at least they
can monitor you there.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.350
I'm fine, Tom.

06:45.417 --> 06:49.884
I... I don't think
that you are, sir.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.983
And neither does Dr. Welton.

06:52.050 --> 06:53.717
Putting myself under medical
supervision might give

06:53.784 --> 06:56.017
the vice president
yet another pretext

06:56.083 --> 06:57.851
to try and take a run at my job.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.317
You don't need
to worry about that, sir.

07:00.384 --> 07:04.651
What exactly do you have
on Vice President Daniels ?

07:12.150 --> 07:14.250
I have the truth, sir.

07:14.317 --> 07:17.651
Now is the time that I need
to know what that is.

07:17.717 --> 07:20.551
It is a tape recording

07:20.617 --> 07:22.717
of Vice President Daniels

07:22.784 --> 07:24.818
conspiring with Lisa Miller
to commit perjury

07:24.884 --> 07:27.217
at your competency hearing.

07:27.284 --> 07:29.983
I'd love to hear that
as soon as possible.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.484
Mr. President, Tom.

07:32.551 --> 07:33.818
I have good news.

07:33.884 --> 07:36.017
CTU has recovered

07:36.083 --> 07:37.517
the two remaining
suitcase nukes.

07:37.584 --> 07:39.117
When ?

07:39.184 --> 07:40.217
Just a few minutes ago.

07:40.284 --> 07:41.918
I just got off
the phone with Bill.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.717
He's waiting to brief you
as soon as you're ready.

07:43.784 --> 07:45.950
What about Fayed ?

07:46.017 --> 07:48.317
He and his men were killed
during the assault.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.417
Then it's over.

07:49.484 --> 07:50.751
Well, it certainly

07:50.818 --> 07:51.950
seems so, sir.

07:52.017 --> 07:54.250
Congratulations.

07:54.317 --> 07:57.083
The American people should know.

07:57.150 --> 07:59.784
And I want to tell them
that we're no longer at
risk of a nuclear attack.

07:59.851 --> 08:01.684
I'll have the press corps
down here in 30 minutes.

08:01.751 --> 08:02.884
No, no, Karen.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.384
We're going to do this
from upstairs,

08:04.451 --> 08:05.551
in the press room.

08:05.617 --> 08:06.884
Should we wait for clearance

08:06.950 --> 08:08.417
from Secret Service ?

08:08.484 --> 08:10.317
No, Tom, there's no need
for any of us

08:10.384 --> 08:11.818
to be hiding underground

08:11.884 --> 08:13.284
for a minute longer.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.050
Inform Secret Service that
we'll be leaving the Bunker

08:16.117 --> 08:18.818
and returning
to the Oval Office.

08:18.884 --> 08:20.184
Yes, sir.

08:22.050 --> 08:25.684
Morris is coordinating with the
Marines Technical Escort Unit

08:25.751 --> 08:26.950
to transfer the bombs

08:27.017 --> 08:29.584
to a NEST facility.

08:29.651 --> 08:30.983
Now that they've taken custody,

08:31.050 --> 08:33.116
I'd like you all
to submit your briefings

08:33.183 --> 08:36.217
to the respective
department heads.

08:37.784 --> 08:41.150
I'd like to share my pride in
the work that you've all done.

08:41.217 --> 08:44.116
We were hit hard.

08:44.183 --> 08:46.217
But not one of you gave up.

08:46.284 --> 08:48.384
You've done excellent
work today.

08:48.451 --> 08:49.751
O'Brian.

08:49.818 --> 08:51.250
Hey, it's me.

08:51.317 --> 08:52.884
Jack. You did it.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.617
Chloe, listen to me.
I need your help.

08:54.684 --> 08:56.517
Well, can't it wait ?

08:56.584 --> 08:58.517
We're just transferring the
bombs, and doing cleanup.

08:58.584 --> 08:59.584
No, it can't.

08:59.651 --> 09:01.484
What is it ?

09:01.551 --> 09:04.751
Chloe, Audrey's still alive.

09:04.818 --> 09:07.317
No, she's not.

09:07.384 --> 09:08.950
Yes, she is,
I just talked to her.

09:09.017 --> 09:10.751
The Chinese faked
her car accident.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.117
They've been holding
her a prisoner

09:12.184 --> 09:13.818
since she was in Beijing
trying to find me.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.717
Oh, my God.

09:16.784 --> 09:17.983
We have to tell Mr. Buchanan.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.384
He'll never go along with it.

09:19.451 --> 09:22.184
Go along with what ?

09:22.250 --> 09:24.717
The Chinese want
to exchange Audrey

09:24.784 --> 09:26.784
for an FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the nukes.

09:26.851 --> 09:31.017
It'll give them
complete access to
Russian defense technology.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.150
I want you to help me retrieve
one of those circuit boards.

09:33.217 --> 09:36.184
Jack, we both know
that if we do this,

09:36.250 --> 09:38.684
it will create an international
situation big time.

09:38.751 --> 09:39.851
Chloe, I know.

09:39.918 --> 09:42.083
I promise I will do
whatever I have to

09:42.150 --> 09:43.451
to stop the Chinese from
getting that circuit board.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.484
But right now I need you

09:45.551 --> 09:47.317
to get me the schematics
for those bombs.

09:47.384 --> 09:48.884
Those files aren't
on my system.

09:48.983 --> 09:50.617
They were reclassified
when the DOD took possession

09:50.684 --> 09:52.117
of the suitcase
nuke you disarmed.

09:52.184 --> 09:54.551
Then you're going to have to
figure out a way to get them,

09:54.617 --> 09:55.784
'cause without those schematics,

09:55.851 --> 09:57.451
I won't know
what I'm looking for.

09:57.517 --> 10:00.217
Yes, I understand, but I don't
know how I can do this.

10:00.284 --> 10:02.350
Chloe, Audrey's life
is at stake. Think.

10:04.284 --> 10:06.184
Wait.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.184
Morris.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.551
He had to file a report
with DOD

10:10.617 --> 10:12.250
about the work he did
on the nukes.

10:12.317 --> 10:13.884
It contained
a revised schematic.

10:13.950 --> 10:15.717
It might still be
on his hard drive.

10:15.784 --> 10:16.818
Can you access it ?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.751
Only directly
from his terminal.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.551
Chloe, please, do it.

10:28.451 --> 10:30.350
Where do you want me to send it ?

10:30.417 --> 10:32.651
To the cell phone that
I'm calling you from.

10:32.717 --> 10:34.684
Use a secure line... Alpha-539.

10:34.751 --> 10:36.584
Hold on.

10:41.983 --> 10:43.551
It's here.

10:43.617 --> 10:45.017
The file's coming up.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.350
I'm sending it
to your screen.

10:47.484 --> 10:48.417
Stand by.

10:48.484 --> 10:49.784
Copy that.

10:54.284 --> 10:55.350
Come on.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.651
Chloe, I don't
see anything.

10:57.717 --> 11:00.617
It needs to load
before it sends.

11:00.684 --> 11:04.484
There's still
30% to go.

11:04.551 --> 11:06.317
Damn it.
What ?

11:06.384 --> 11:09.217
Morris is coming back
to his station.
Hurry.

11:09.284 --> 11:10.350
There's nothing
I can do.

11:10.417 --> 11:12.083
I need to log
out now. He's here.

11:12.150 --> 11:14.451
No, Chloe, wait.

11:14.517 --> 11:16.751
Jack...

11:17.551 --> 11:18.551
I got it.

11:39.618 --> 11:41.950
Yes ?

11:42.017 --> 11:44.484
Mr. President,
the vice president is here.

11:48.451 --> 11:49.683
Send him in.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.984
Noah...

12:04.050 --> 12:05.317
Please sit.

12:10.551 --> 12:13.683
Listen, I, uh...

12:13.750 --> 12:15.750
I want to begin by expressing

12:15.817 --> 12:17.717
my gratitude to you.

12:17.783 --> 12:19.984
For a lesson well learned.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.984
I'm not sure what
you mean by that,

12:24.050 --> 12:27.084
Mr. President.
I still believe
attacking Abu Fayed's

12:27.151 --> 12:28.917
country with a nuclear
weapon would have been

12:28.984 --> 12:31.084
a serious mistake, Noah; I'm not
going lie to you about that.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.451
But...

12:33.518 --> 12:36.217
if you hadn't put that option
on the table in the first place,

12:36.284 --> 12:38.618
I never would've gone
as far as I did.

12:38.683 --> 12:41.650
And the bombs might
still be out there.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.217
That being said...

12:43.284 --> 12:44.917
I think we would both agree

12:44.984 --> 12:47.584
that our relationship
has always been a marriage

12:47.650 --> 12:48.884
of convenience.

12:48.950 --> 12:51.284
A way to strengthen the ticket,
rather than a case

12:51.351 --> 12:55.084
of us actually seeing eye to eye
on pretty much anything.

12:55.151 --> 12:58.850
And now that
it's over, this crisis,

12:58.917 --> 13:01.017
it's become clear to me,
Noah, that I just

13:01.084 --> 13:03.518
don't think it's possible for us
to work together anymore.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.117
Excuse me ?

13:10.184 --> 13:12.151
I'm asking for your resignation.

13:14.584 --> 13:17.518
How dare you.

13:17.584 --> 13:19.384
You don't have the right
to ask for my

13:19.451 --> 13:21.451
resignation.
This isn't about

13:21.518 --> 13:24.284
what the Constitution
says, Noah.

13:24.351 --> 13:26.384
It's about what's best
for this country

13:26.451 --> 13:27.717
in a time of crisis.

13:27.783 --> 13:29.451
How in the world do
you figure that ?

13:29.518 --> 13:32.184
I can't lead effectively
with you undermining me

13:32.251 --> 13:34.384
at every single opportunity
that you may get.

13:34.451 --> 13:37.884
Now let's be honest
with each other.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.717
That's exactly what you would
do if you stayed in place.

13:43.783 --> 13:45.750
Mr. President...

13:47.618 --> 13:49.017
I refuse.

13:50.618 --> 13:52.518
Good night.

13:52.584 --> 13:55.217
You don't want
to walk out that door.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.251
Not like this.

13:58.551 --> 14:00.417
Otherwise I may
have to make this

14:00.484 --> 14:03.017
extremely unpleasant for you.

14:03.084 --> 14:06.017
Now what are you talking about ?

14:06.084 --> 14:07.917
I'm talking about the
recording that Tom Lennox

14:07.984 --> 14:10.384
<i>has in his possession.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

14:11.618 --> 14:14.017
Conspiracy to
commit perjury

14:14.084 --> 14:16.417
is a serious offense.

14:16.484 --> 14:18.518
Now I have to assume
you'd rather resign,

14:18.584 --> 14:21.351
than spend the rest of
your life living with that

14:21.417 --> 14:23.351
kind of humiliation.

14:23.417 --> 14:26.050
So is resorting to blackmail

14:26.117 --> 14:29.117
your idea
of effective leadership ?

14:29.184 --> 14:30.783
If there is anything I've
learned anything from you,

14:30.850 --> 14:32.917
Noah, it would be
that sometimes it's

14:32.984 --> 14:35.618
necessary to apply
a little brute force.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.618
I don't need your
resignation immediately.

14:39.717 --> 14:41.783
Let's give the country
a chance to take a breath

14:41.850 --> 14:43.451
after what happened today.

14:43.518 --> 14:45.151
Some time in
the next week

14:45.217 --> 14:47.417
will be just fine,
Mr. Vice President.

15:05.484 --> 15:07.151
NEST wants a flight path
cleared to Edwards

15:07.217 --> 15:08.817
for 20 miles
in each direction.

15:08.884 --> 15:10.484
Could you get back
to me with confirmation ?

15:10.551 --> 15:11.984
Thank you.

15:12.050 --> 15:13.284
ETA on the helicopter

15:13.351 --> 15:15.251
that will transport
the bombs is 15 minutes.

15:15.317 --> 15:16.917
You should distribute protocols
to the NEST team.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.251
I'm on that.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.584
That's odd.
What ?

15:23.650 --> 15:25.817
I think someone's hacked
into my system.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.117
Are you sure ?

15:28.184 --> 15:29.351
Yes, I'm sure.

15:29.417 --> 15:30.484
Ever since
what happened to Nadia,

15:30.551 --> 15:31.750
I installed a logging
program to track

15:31.817 --> 15:33.518
any unauthorized access
to my hard drive.

15:33.584 --> 15:34.817
You did ?

15:34.884 --> 15:37.618
It's telling me
that someone accessed

15:37.683 --> 15:40.351
my files ten minutes ago...

15:40.417 --> 15:42.351
and downloaded
the updated schematics

15:42.417 --> 15:44.384
to those suitcase nukes.

15:46.151 --> 15:47.850
I'm calling security.
Wait !

15:47.917 --> 15:49.817
Don't call security.

15:53.184 --> 15:55.417
I'm the one who hacked
into your system.

15:57.584 --> 15:59.384
Why would you do that ?

15:59.451 --> 16:02.417
I'll explain it to you
in a little while.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.317
Explain it to me now.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.683
I did it for Jack.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.284
Audrey Raines is still alive.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.817
The Chinese are
holding her hostage.

16:26.884 --> 16:28.683
What ?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.518
They're going to kill
her unless Jack delivers

16:30.584 --> 16:33.184
an FB-sub-circuit board from
one of the bombs to them.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.317
You've been to all
the same briefings.

16:41.384 --> 16:43.551
The Russians have been
trying to keep that technology

16:43.618 --> 16:45.717
out of Chinese hands for years.
I know.

16:45.783 --> 16:47.351
Well, what are
the Russians going to say

16:47.417 --> 16:48.750
when they find out we just

16:48.817 --> 16:51.017
gave it to them ?
It's not going to get that far.

16:51.084 --> 16:52.384
How in the world
do you know

16:52.451 --> 16:54.217
it's not going
to get that far ?

16:54.284 --> 16:56.518
Because Jack gave me his word.

16:58.717 --> 16:59.917
I'm sorry, darling.

16:59.984 --> 17:01.551
I can't leave it at that.

17:01.618 --> 17:03.017
Yes, you can.

17:05.084 --> 17:06.817
The bombs that
I reprogrammed for Fayed

17:06.884 --> 17:08.983
could have killed tens
of thousands of people.

17:09.050 --> 17:10.217
But that didn't happen.

17:10.284 --> 17:11.916
I know what it felt like
to think that I could've

17:11.983 --> 17:14.017
been responsible for each
and everyone of their deaths.

17:14.084 --> 17:17.017
I can't be involved
with something

17:17.084 --> 17:19.817
that could easily
end up starting a war.

17:19.884 --> 17:21.351
It's not going to start a war

17:21.416 --> 17:23.084
because it's not going
to get that far.

17:23.151 --> 17:24.750
Besides, this has
nothing to do with you.

17:24.817 --> 17:26.483
I did it.
Yes, it does.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.351
Now that you've
told me, it does.

17:28.416 --> 17:29.750
You have to tell Buchanan.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.451
I can't.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.284
Then you're forcing me to.

17:33.351 --> 17:36.551
No.
I'm going to do it.

17:36.618 --> 17:38.584
No ! Morris !
I'm doing it.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.717
I'll tell him.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.984
Reinforcements aren't
necessary at this point.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.050
The military
is guarding the bombs.

18:10.117 --> 18:12.884
There's a CTU SWAT
team standing by.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.584
They'll be en route soon.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.484
All right, thank you.

18:19.551 --> 18:20.950
What is it, Chloe ?

18:21.017 --> 18:22.484
Mr. Buchanan...

18:26.017 --> 18:28.717
I'm sorry, there's something
that you need to know.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.351
* *

19:03.518 --> 19:05.817
You two, come with me.
Sir, this area's

19:05.884 --> 19:08.117
off-limits.
I'm Agent Bauer.
I was the man that was

19:08.184 --> 19:10.551
responsible for securing
these nukes. I'm under

19:10.618 --> 19:12.884
a presidential order to
remove the FB-circuit board
from one of these bombs,

19:12.950 --> 19:15.783
have it transferred back to
CTU for immediate analysis.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.950
We don't have much time.
This building has been
compromised. Now open

19:18.017 --> 19:19.551
the gate.
Sir, no one is allowed

19:19.618 --> 19:20.984
in here.
Are you countermanding

19:21.050 --> 19:23.117
a presidential order ?
How dare you, Sergeant ? !

19:23.184 --> 19:25.518
Now you're wasting my time.
What's your name ?

19:25.584 --> 19:27.618
What's your name ? !

19:27.683 --> 19:28.717
I want your name, too.

19:28.783 --> 19:29.917
Now !
That's not necessary.

19:29.984 --> 19:31.917
Open the gate.
Open the gate !

19:38.151 --> 19:39.750
I want both of you
to stand guard

19:39.817 --> 19:42.117
while I remove
the circuit board. Come on !

20:15.950 --> 20:20.251
One, two, three...

20:21.417 --> 20:23.117
DOYLE:
Stand down, Jack !

20:23.184 --> 20:24.251
I can't do that.

20:24.317 --> 20:25.451
I won't say it again !

20:25.518 --> 20:27.317
Drop it.
Agent Doyle, I am
following orders

20:27.384 --> 20:29.117
that exceed your
security clearance !
He's a rogue agent.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.950
Take him out !
I will shoot !
Put your weapon

20:31.017 --> 20:32.151
down or I will
shoot you !
Take him !

20:32.217 --> 20:34.151
Now !

20:35.618 --> 20:37.584
Secure him, he's under arrest.

21:02.717 --> 21:05.650
Doyle, please.
Just listen to me.

21:05.717 --> 21:07.383
Bill, we've got Jack.
What did he say ?

21:07.450 --> 21:08.984
Not much. I had
to subdue him.

21:09.051 --> 21:10.084
Let me talk to him.

21:10.151 --> 21:12.817
Hold on.

21:12.884 --> 21:14.283
Buchanan wants to talk to you.

21:14.350 --> 21:15.817
Bill...

21:15.884 --> 21:18.317
Jack, Chloe just told me
about Audrey and the Chinese.

21:18.383 --> 21:20.751
I can't let you give
them the component.

21:20.817 --> 21:22.817
I'm not going to.

21:22.884 --> 21:24.851
I only need to have it long
enough for them to let her go.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.051
I was never going to let

21:26.118 --> 21:27.450
the Chinese keep it,
Bill, I swear to you.

21:27.517 --> 21:30.350
Whatever you have planned,
Jack, I can't let you do it.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.851
Bill, please...

21:32.917 --> 21:34.151
Right now we're the only

21:34.218 --> 21:36.250
chance she's got.
I understand what Audrey

21:36.317 --> 21:38.917
means to you. I promise
I will do everything

21:38.984 --> 21:41.250
in my power to get her back.
You didn't even
know she was alive.

21:41.317 --> 21:43.751
Cheng is going to make it

21:43.817 --> 21:46.350
impossible for us
to ever find her again.

21:46.417 --> 21:47.584
We are her only hope

21:47.650 --> 21:48.884
and you know it.

21:48.951 --> 21:50.517
I don't know what
to tell you, Jack,

21:50.584 --> 21:52.317
except let Doyle
bring you back here

21:52.383 --> 21:54.017
and we'll work out a game plan.

21:55.650 --> 21:57.617
Will you let me make
one more call ?

22:01.084 --> 22:03.283
I'm asking you
as a friend.

22:03.350 --> 22:05.383
Who do you want
to talk to ?

22:08.151 --> 22:10.817
President Wayne Palmer.

22:10.884 --> 22:13.383
I'll see if I can reach him.

22:13.450 --> 22:15.383
Let me talk to Doyle.

22:15.450 --> 22:17.051
Yeah.

22:17.118 --> 22:20.250
He wants
to talk to you.

22:20.317 --> 22:22.350
Doyle.

22:22.417 --> 22:25.151
Keep Jack in custody while I
try to contact the president.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.951
I'll route the call
through your cell.

22:27.017 --> 22:29.151
Yes, sir. I understand.

22:29.218 --> 22:30.383
Get him up.

22:34.118 --> 22:35.751
White House sources
have confirmed

22:35.817 --> 22:37.884
that terrorist leader
Abu Fayed is dead.

22:37.951 --> 22:39.884
The president has reportedly
recovered from injuries

22:39.951 --> 22:41.984
sustained from
the failed attempt on his life,

22:42.051 --> 22:44.350
and he is expected
to make a statement shortly

22:44.417 --> 22:45.851
regarding unconfirmed rumors...

22:45.917 --> 22:47.484
Yes ?

22:47.550 --> 22:49.984
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan
has Jack Bauer on the line.

22:50.051 --> 22:51.151
Put him through, please.

22:52.383 --> 22:53.550
Go ahead.

22:53.617 --> 22:55.550
Please hold for the President.

22:55.617 --> 22:57.084
It's the president.

22:57.151 --> 22:58.984
Excuse me.

22:59.051 --> 23:01.218
Mr. President.

23:01.283 --> 23:02.417
Yes, Jack.

23:02.484 --> 23:03.984
Congratulations.
Is everything still all right ?

23:04.051 --> 23:05.584
Yes, sir. The bombs are secure.

23:05.650 --> 23:08.184
But I'm calling
because I want you

23:08.250 --> 23:09.550
to authorize a
field operation.

23:09.617 --> 23:11.717
For what purpose ?

23:11.784 --> 23:13.017
To save
Audrey Raines.
What ?

23:13.084 --> 23:14.417
Mr. President,
she's still alive.

23:14.484 --> 23:17.051
The Chinese have been holding
her for the past few months.

23:17.118 --> 23:19.084
Now they're using her
as a bargaining chip.

23:19.151 --> 23:20.951
In exchange for what ?

23:21.017 --> 23:23.584
For an FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the nukes.

23:23.650 --> 23:26.784
They say they'll release Audrey
unharmed if I bring it to them.

23:26.851 --> 23:29.450
It's my understanding, Jack,

23:29.517 --> 23:31.851
that component holds the key
to Russian defense codes.

23:31.917 --> 23:33.517
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

23:33.584 --> 23:35.751
I'm sympathetic, I am,
and I promise you

23:35.817 --> 23:38.383
that I will make available
to you the full resources

23:38.450 --> 23:40.218
of this country
to get Audrey back,

23:40.283 --> 23:42.218
but I hope you're not
expecting me to authorize

23:42.283 --> 23:44.051
this exchange.
Not exactly.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.151
Then what exactly ?

23:45.218 --> 23:47.317
Mr. President,
I need the Chinese to believe

23:47.383 --> 23:49.550
that I am willing to go through
with this exchange.

23:49.617 --> 23:51.350
I need to have
that component on me.

23:51.417 --> 23:52.917
They're going
to need to see it.

23:52.984 --> 23:54.617
As soon as I know
that Audrey is free,

23:54.684 --> 23:55.784
I will destroy it.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.951
And how can you
guarantee that ?

23:57.017 --> 23:59.884
I'm asking you to trust me,

23:59.951 --> 24:01.751
Mr. President.

24:01.817 --> 24:05.383
I give you my word that
that component will not end up

24:05.450 --> 24:06.817
in Chinese hands.

24:06.884 --> 24:08.784
But if it does, the Russians,
despite our peace accord,

24:08.851 --> 24:11.417
may take action against us
for allowing it to happen.

24:11.484 --> 24:14.084
Now, under most circumstances,
yes, your word would be

24:14.151 --> 24:17.017
sufficient, but in this case,
Jack, I need to know details.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.118
If I have to,

24:20.184 --> 24:21.717
I will destroy
that circuit board

24:21.784 --> 24:24.017
with a concealed
charge of C-4.

24:24.084 --> 24:27.017
An explosion of C-4
would take out anything

24:27.084 --> 24:29.751
within 30 feet of it.

24:32.118 --> 24:34.283
You're going
to sacrifice yourself ?

24:34.350 --> 24:35.550
Yes, sir, if I have to.

24:35.617 --> 24:38.151
Jack...

24:38.218 --> 24:40.283
Mr. President, please.

24:40.350 --> 24:42.450
Please, I am begging you.

24:42.517 --> 24:44.250
Audrey Raines was willing

24:44.317 --> 24:46.417
to give up her life
to save mine.

24:46.484 --> 24:49.417
I cannot and will not do
anything less for her.

24:49.484 --> 24:52.617
You're asking me to sign off
on a probable suicide mission.

24:52.684 --> 24:53.984
With all due respect,

24:54.051 --> 24:55.250
Mr. President, 16 hours ago,

24:55.317 --> 24:57.650
your people were willing
to hand me over for dead,

24:57.717 --> 25:00.017
and I did not hesitate.

25:00.084 --> 25:05.550
Mr. President, you owe me.

25:08.717 --> 25:12.784
And you're sure
this is the only way ?

25:12.851 --> 25:14.317
Yes.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.784
All right, then.

25:20.851 --> 25:23.784
I will not fail you,
Mr. President.

25:25.917 --> 25:28.984
I'll tell Bill to give you
whatever you need.

25:29.051 --> 25:30.517
Now I'm going
to need confirmation

25:30.584 --> 25:31.851
that circuit board
has been destroyed

25:31.917 --> 25:33.350
after Audrey has been released.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.350
I'll have CTU embed
a tracking device in the board.

25:35.417 --> 25:36.684
You'll have your confirmation.

25:36.751 --> 25:38.517
Good luck, Jack.

25:38.584 --> 25:40.784
Thank you, Mr. President.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.751
Let me speak with Bill Buchanan.

25:57.184 --> 25:59.617
Yes, sir. I understand.

26:01.517 --> 26:03.617
Get over here.

26:11.718 --> 26:13.651
What did he say ?

26:13.718 --> 26:15.818
Buchanan said the president
signed off on this,

26:15.883 --> 26:20.351
and to give you
whatever help you need.

26:20.417 --> 26:21.850
I'm going to need someone
to help me

26:21.917 --> 26:23.517
with Audrey's extraction
during the exchange.

26:23.584 --> 26:24.983
I want that to be you.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.684
Fine.

26:27.751 --> 26:29.584
Where are you going to be ?

26:29.651 --> 26:31.250
The name of the Chinese agent

26:31.317 --> 26:35.084
that's holding Audrey
is Cheng Zhi.

26:35.150 --> 26:37.150
He was responsible for
my interrogation and torture

26:37.217 --> 26:39.150
for almost two years
in that Chinese prison.

26:39.217 --> 26:40.818
As soon as I get
the signal from you

26:40.883 --> 26:42.983
that Audrey is safe, two things
are going to happen.

26:43.050 --> 26:45.384
I'm going to destroy
that circuit board,

26:45.451 --> 26:48.718
and Cheng Zhi isn't going
to make it out of here alive.

26:48.784 --> 26:50.983
So, in answer
to your question,

26:51.050 --> 26:52.284
where am
I going to be ?

26:52.351 --> 26:55.818
Wherever I have to.

26:55.883 --> 26:57.351
Let's go.

27:09.917 --> 27:11.484
Are you going
to tell me what happened ?

27:11.551 --> 27:15.584
The president agreed
to Jack's plan.

27:15.651 --> 27:18.751
The president's going
to allow Jack to hand over

27:18.818 --> 27:20.983
a defense algorithm
to the Chinese ?

27:21.050 --> 27:23.317
No. Of course not.

27:23.384 --> 27:24.751
Jack will destroy the component

27:24.818 --> 27:26.084
as soon as he knows
Audrey's safe.

27:26.150 --> 27:28.250
The Chinese will
never get it.

27:28.317 --> 27:29.751
And how is he going
to manage that ?

27:29.818 --> 27:32.850
I don't know.
I guess President Palmer

27:32.917 --> 27:34.850
trusts him.

27:34.917 --> 27:37.517
Telling Buchanan
was the right thing to do.

27:37.584 --> 27:39.017
You know it was.

27:39.084 --> 27:40.417
It doesn't matter.

27:40.484 --> 27:41.784
You should have trusted me.

27:41.850 --> 27:43.684
Trusted you ?

27:43.751 --> 27:45.417
You're the one
that broke into my system.

27:45.484 --> 27:47.451
That's because
I didn't think you'd back me up.

27:47.517 --> 27:48.950
Obviously, I was right.

27:49.017 --> 27:51.417
So you're going to hold this
over my head now, are you ?

27:51.484 --> 27:54.617
Yeah. For a long time.

27:54.684 --> 27:56.883
For how long ?
Could you give me an estimate ?

27:59.983 --> 28:01.718
I'll get back to you.

28:06.718 --> 28:10.050
Nadia, Doyle's on line three.

28:10.117 --> 28:13.084
They're going to lock you
on the tracker frequency.

28:14.883 --> 28:16.217
This is Nadia.

28:16.284 --> 28:17.983
It's me.
The tracker's on line.

28:18.050 --> 28:19.818
The frequency marker

28:19.883 --> 28:21.150
is Alpha-1793.

28:25.184 --> 28:26.384
Signal's good.
You're on the grid.

28:26.451 --> 28:28.551
Copy. Jack and I are
getting ready to move out.

28:31.950 --> 28:33.150
Yes ?

28:33.217 --> 28:35.584
I have the circuit board.
Where am I going ?

28:35.651 --> 28:37.883
Get on the 180 and head north.

28:37.950 --> 28:41.417
Get off the first exit
after mile marker 49.

28:41.484 --> 28:44.050
I will give you
further instructions
when you've exited.

28:44.117 --> 28:45.150
I got it.

28:45.217 --> 28:46.784
You have
a half an hour.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.850
I don't think I
need to remind you

28:47.917 --> 28:48.917
what would happen
if you are late.

28:48.983 --> 28:50.818
I understand.

28:54.117 --> 28:55.784
CTU has the signal.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.584
They're monitoring
the device.

28:57.651 --> 29:00.517
I'm set. Let's go.

29:00.584 --> 29:02.684
Jack, you're taking
a hell of a risk.

29:02.751 --> 29:04.784
If this goes sour,
it could stir a firestorm.

29:04.850 --> 29:06.317
And for what ?

29:06.384 --> 29:08.384
If you were in my shoes,
you wouldn't do the same thing ?

29:08.451 --> 29:10.284
I don't mix relationships
with my job.

29:10.351 --> 29:13.117
Whatever you had with this
woman, I hope it's worth it.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.718
This isn't about what
I had with a woman.

29:15.784 --> 29:17.250
Her name is
Audrey Raines.

29:17.317 --> 29:19.850
She served this country
with honor. We owe her.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.551
So get in the truck.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.883
Come in.

29:41.883 --> 29:43.651
You wanted to see me ?

29:43.718 --> 29:45.184
Close the door.

29:58.983 --> 30:03.150
The president has just
asked me to resign.

30:03.217 --> 30:05.017
What ?

30:05.084 --> 30:08.351
And I'm going to comply
with his request.

30:08.417 --> 30:12.184
I wanted to

30:12.250 --> 30:14.684
tell you personally before you
found out from someone else.

30:14.751 --> 30:17.384
I don't understand.

30:17.451 --> 30:19.384
Why are you going along
with this ?

30:19.451 --> 30:21.050
Why don't you just tell him
that you refuse ?

30:21.117 --> 30:23.050
He has a tape
of our conversation.

30:23.117 --> 30:25.551
The one where we

30:25.617 --> 30:27.651
conspire to commit perjury,

30:27.718 --> 30:29.250
and he's threatening to use it
against me unless

30:29.317 --> 30:31.784
I step down.

30:31.850 --> 30:33.017
Oh, my God.

30:33.084 --> 30:34.084
Tom Lennox

30:34.150 --> 30:36.584
recorded it.

30:36.651 --> 30:41.551
Bottom line is, I'm not
being given a choice here.

30:44.417 --> 30:45.883
This is all my fault.

30:45.950 --> 30:49.384
If I hadn't asked
you to lie about
Karen Hayes,

30:49.451 --> 30:50.751
none of this
would be happening.

30:50.818 --> 30:52.417
You were just trying
to protect me.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.217
I could have turned you down,
but I didn't.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.617
Don't blame yourself.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.983
I'm so sorry.

31:05.317 --> 31:06.950
I don't know what to say.

31:09.617 --> 31:14.983
Aw, hell,
at least we'll have a lot more

31:15.050 --> 31:17.451
time to
spend together.

31:22.684 --> 31:27.084
The president said
to take a week,

31:27.150 --> 31:33.818
but I want this letter
of resignation in his hands

31:33.883 --> 31:36.983
by the time he finishes
his press conference.

31:41.917 --> 31:45.818
I am through being
the loyal opposition.

31:55.484 --> 31:58.517
Please, sit.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.017
First, I want to say

32:00.084 --> 32:01.818
that I'm grateful to report

32:01.883 --> 32:05.584
that Abu Fayed, the man
responsible for these attacks,

32:05.651 --> 32:07.484
has been killed,

32:07.551 --> 32:11.017
and that all nuclear devices
have been recovered.

32:11.084 --> 32:13.651
I want to take the time
to acknowledge the brave men

32:13.718 --> 32:16.883
and women in our various
law enforcement agencies,

32:16.950 --> 32:19.217
and let us not forget
our armed services.

32:19.284 --> 32:23.117
All these people
have worked so hard

32:23.184 --> 32:25.250
to bring this crisis to an end.

32:25.317 --> 32:29.117
Their dedication, their
perseverance is without equal.

32:29.184 --> 32:31.317
Despite the brutality
of these attacks,

32:31.384 --> 32:33.983
we did not allow the violence
born of extremism

32:34.050 --> 32:35.551
<i>to push us to extremes.</i>

32:35.617 --> 32:37.818
And, as Americans, we can

32:37.883 --> 32:41.950
and should take pride
and comfort in that fact.

32:42.017 --> 32:46.551
Let me conclude
by asking for your prayers

32:46.617 --> 32:51.484
tonight for all those
who grieve this day.

32:51.551 --> 32:53.983
For all those whose lives
have been shattered.

32:54.050 --> 32:57.917
Let us reach out and begin
the process of rebuilding.

32:57.983 --> 32:59.150
Let us reach out

32:59.217 --> 33:02.417
and begin the process
of national healing.

33:02.484 --> 33:03.584
Thank you.

33:03.651 --> 33:06.050
I'll take some
of your questions now.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.050
Yes. Ian.

33:07.117 --> 33:08.351
Mr. President, how certain

33:08.417 --> 33:10.917
are you that the crisis
is, in fact, over, and that

33:10.983 --> 33:13.384
there are no more of these
weapons on American soil ?

33:13.451 --> 33:15.184
Well, based on the intelligence
that I've seen,

33:15.250 --> 33:18.217
I can say with full confidence,
Ian, that the worst has passed,

33:18.284 --> 33:20.017
and that the individuals
responsible

33:20.084 --> 33:21.883
for these attacks
have been apprehended,

33:21.950 --> 33:23.250
or else killed.

33:23.317 --> 33:24.950
Yes, Andrea.

33:25.017 --> 33:26.017
Robin, sir.

33:26.084 --> 33:27.017
Robin, yes. Robin.

33:27.084 --> 33:29.784
I'm sorry, it's been a,

33:29.850 --> 33:32.017
it's been a very long
day. Please, go ahead.

33:32.084 --> 33:33.883
Mr. President,
there are several thousand

33:33.950 --> 33:35.484
Muslim Americans
still being held

33:35.551 --> 33:38.150
in detention facilities
across the country.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.284
What's going to happen

33:39.351 --> 33:40.517
to these people ?

33:40.584 --> 33:42.017
I've already directed
Homeland Security

33:42.084 --> 33:44.818
to begin dismantling
these detention facilities.

33:44.883 --> 33:46.751
Uh... all detainees
are to be released

33:46.818 --> 33:48.551
once the immediate crisis

33:48.617 --> 33:50.617
is passed.

33:50.684 --> 33:52.751
<i>Excuse me. Um, now
that the crisis</i>

33:52.818 --> 33:58.818
has passed, we will be, um...
we will be reviewing

33:58.883 --> 33:59.950
the situation
regarding individuals

34:00.017 --> 34:01.384
that we have in custody.

34:01.451 --> 34:03.651
I'm sorry.

34:03.718 --> 34:05.684
I'm, not, uh, I'm
not being very clear.

34:05.751 --> 34:08.650
Uh, let me say again
regarding your question,

34:08.717 --> 34:10.417
Andrea, that... Robin.

34:10.484 --> 34:12.117
I'm sorry. Robin.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.484
Let me say again regarding...

34:14.551 --> 34:18.917
regarding your question
that the, uh...

34:18.983 --> 34:23.250
the detention facilities
that, that, that we will, uh...

34:23.317 --> 34:25.917
uh... that, uh...

34:28.484 --> 34:30.317
We, we're going t... Ugh !

34:30.384 --> 34:31.250
Oh, my God.

34:31.317 --> 34:34.016
Get Medical right away !

34:34.083 --> 34:35.949
Code 4. Repeat, Code 4.

34:36.016 --> 34:38.284
We need an emergency medical
team to the press room.

34:38.351 --> 34:39.684
Get these people out of here.

34:39.751 --> 34:40.784
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:40.850 --> 34:42.150
we need to clear this room.

35:07.617 --> 35:09.351
All signs indicate the president

35:09.417 --> 35:10.718
has suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage

35:10.784 --> 35:14.484
brought on by injuries he
sustained earlier in the day.

35:14.551 --> 35:16.217
Meaning he never should have
been brought out of the coma.

35:16.284 --> 35:19.150
However detrimental
that decision was

35:19.217 --> 35:21.150
to his health,
I'm confident

35:21.217 --> 35:22.684
that in light of
his actions today,

35:22.751 --> 35:24.150
he would continue
to support it.

35:24.217 --> 35:27.684
I'm glad you're so confident,
Karen, since it was

35:27.751 --> 35:30.184
your reckless action
that resulted in his stroke.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.017
Sir, it's unclear
if the stroke

35:32.084 --> 35:33.484
was inevitable,
but in any event,

35:33.551 --> 35:34.684
I'll take full
responsibility.

35:34.751 --> 35:35.883
Excuse me.

35:35.950 --> 35:37.850
Now is not the time
for recriminations,

35:37.917 --> 35:40.084
self-imposed or otherwise.

35:40.150 --> 35:42.217
Doctor, when will we know
the extent of the damage

35:42.284 --> 35:43.850
and the prospects
for recovery ?

35:43.917 --> 35:46.050
After the MRI.

35:46.117 --> 35:47.584
The president is being
prepped for transport

35:47.651 --> 35:49.017
to Bethesda
as we speak.

35:49.084 --> 35:50.117
Based on my
impressions,

35:50.184 --> 35:52.517
the damage was severe.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.883
I don't think we can

35:53.950 --> 35:56.983
expect the president to regain
consciousness anytime soon.

35:57.050 --> 35:59.718
So it is incontestable
Wayne Palmer won't

35:59.784 --> 36:01.983
be able to continue his
duties as commander-in-chief.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.883
There's no denying that this is
a great tragedy for the nation

36:11.950 --> 36:15.850
and... for those of us who
know the president personally.

36:18.184 --> 36:19.651
Just... take care of him,
Doctor.

36:19.718 --> 36:22.150
Of course.

36:22.217 --> 36:23.250
Excuse me.

36:29.551 --> 36:31.751
Notify the Senate and the House
of the transfer of power

36:31.818 --> 36:34.117
and have the sec def and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs

36:34.184 --> 36:35.417
authorize me under
the 25th Amendment.

36:35.484 --> 36:37.883
Yes, sir.

36:37.950 --> 36:39.651
Tom...

36:39.718 --> 36:42.850
have the press secretary
issue a statement.

36:42.917 --> 36:47.517
President Palmer's been...
incapacitated.

36:47.584 --> 36:49.117
No need for alarm.

36:49.184 --> 36:51.517
Executive authority's
been transferred to me.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.351
Our...
hopes and prayers are with him.

36:54.417 --> 36:55.850
All right, sir.

36:55.917 --> 36:57.850
And I'll also need you

36:57.917 --> 37:01.184
available to review everything
on the president's agenda.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.384
All right, sir.

37:02.451 --> 37:04.184
Actually, there's something
on the agenda

37:04.250 --> 37:06.317
I think you'll want
immediate clarification on.

37:06.384 --> 37:08.317
What's that ?

37:08.384 --> 37:10.517
Wayne Palmer just
issued a finding

37:10.584 --> 37:13.384
allowing Jack Bauer to hand
classified Russian technology

37:13.451 --> 37:15.217
over to the Chinese
in exchange

37:15.284 --> 37:18.850
for the return of a
covertly held hostage.

37:20.850 --> 37:21.784
Can you explain this ?

37:21.850 --> 37:23.084
Yes. That was

37:23.150 --> 37:26.050
a personal request from Jack
Bauer to the president.

37:26.117 --> 37:27.384
They have a
longstanding
relationship

37:27.451 --> 37:29.818
and as Jack Bauer was
largely responsible

37:29.883 --> 37:31.150
for recovering
the suitcase nukes today,

37:31.217 --> 37:34.150
the president wanted to honor
his service to this country.

37:34.217 --> 37:36.751
Karen, I asked you
to explain it, not excuse it.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.484
Understood.

37:40.551 --> 37:43.150
Bauer has guaranteed
that the technology

37:43.217 --> 37:45.484
will not fall into the hands
of the Chinese.

37:45.551 --> 37:48.150
It will only be used
to secure the hostage.

37:48.217 --> 37:50.684
Incidentally, sir,
the hostage in question

37:50.751 --> 37:54.050
is Audrey Raines,
daughter of James Heller.

37:54.117 --> 37:56.284
Even Jack Bauer can't
guarantee that outcome.

37:56.351 --> 37:58.517
Now, I am

37:58.584 --> 38:03.517
happy to honor Agent Bauer's
service to this country,

38:03.584 --> 38:06.050
but not at the risk of giving

38:06.117 --> 38:08.517
classified technology
to the Chinese and...

38:08.584 --> 38:11.684
potentially
damaging our
relationship

38:11.751 --> 38:12.718
with Russia in the process.

38:12.784 --> 38:13.883
You tell CTU

38:13.950 --> 38:15.517
to stop Bauer... immediately.

38:15.584 --> 38:16.517
Sir.

38:16.584 --> 38:18.184
The president expressly...

38:18.250 --> 38:20.784
That's all for
now, Karen.

38:20.850 --> 38:22.184
You, too, Tom.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.384
Unbelievable.

38:40.451 --> 38:42.484
Less than a minute
behind his desk

38:42.551 --> 38:44.818
and he's already disregarding
the president's wishes.

38:44.883 --> 38:47.351
Nevertheless, we both
share Daniel's unease

38:47.417 --> 38:48.617
in handing
military secrets

38:48.684 --> 38:49.651
over to the Chinese.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.217
I know, Tom, but that
is not the point.

38:52.284 --> 38:53.351
No, here's the point.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.217
Daniels is now
the acting president,

38:55.284 --> 38:57.284
whether we like it or not.

38:57.351 --> 38:59.751
I'm off to the hospital.

38:59.818 --> 39:01.217
I'll see you there.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.417
Buchanan.

39:10.484 --> 39:12.050
Hi, it's me.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.150
How's president Palmer ?

39:13.217 --> 39:14.517
Not good.

39:14.584 --> 39:17.517
The doctor says that he
has a cerebral hemorrhage

39:17.584 --> 39:19.517
They don't know the
extent of the damage,

39:19.584 --> 39:22.217
but obviously he's
not able to serve.

39:22.284 --> 39:24.917
Daniels is going
to assume the office,

39:24.983 --> 39:26.517
and the first wave of his hand,

39:26.584 --> 39:28.484
he wants to stop
Jack's operation.

39:28.551 --> 39:30.751
Jack has to return to CTU

39:30.818 --> 39:32.217
as soon as possible
with the component.

39:32.284 --> 39:34.217
Does the vice president
understand the circumstances

39:34.284 --> 39:35.917
under which Wayne Palmer
agreed to this ?

39:35.983 --> 39:38.217
No. He's not that
kind of a man.

39:38.284 --> 39:39.651
He doesn't operate
in shades of gray.

39:39.718 --> 39:41.917
Does he understand Jack's not
gonna give up without a fight ?

39:41.983 --> 39:44.417
You just have to get
Jack back to CTU

39:44.484 --> 39:46.317
as soon as
possible, okay ?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.684
Okay, I'll take care of it.

39:53.150 --> 39:54.651
Listen up.

39:54.718 --> 39:56.484
The White House has
ordered us to shut down

39:56.551 --> 39:58.850
Jack's operation. How far away
are support teams ?

39:58.917 --> 40:00.050
Six miles.

40:00.117 --> 40:01.983
Have them standing by,
ready to move in,

40:02.050 --> 40:03.150
Contact CHP. Have them

40:03.217 --> 40:05.850
set up roadblocks.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.651
Chloe, I want you
to stand down

40:07.718 --> 40:08.718
on this operation.
Why ?

40:08.784 --> 40:09.718
You've shown me

40:09.784 --> 40:10.751
I can't trust you.

40:12.718 --> 40:13.950
Morris, you cover comm.

40:14.017 --> 40:15.217
Jack's not gonna
go along with this.

40:15.284 --> 40:16.417
I know.

40:24.417 --> 40:25.384
Doyle.

40:25.451 --> 40:26.417
Mike, it's Bill.

40:26.484 --> 40:28.084
Can Jack hear you ?
Say yes or no.

40:28.150 --> 40:29.217
Yes.

40:29.284 --> 40:30.284
There's been
a change in profile.

40:30.351 --> 40:32.184
Noah Daniels is
acting President.

40:32.250 --> 40:35.084
He wants the operation shut
down and Jack brought back

40:35.150 --> 40:36.917
to CTU immediately.
Understood.

40:36.983 --> 40:38.551
What's your
current location ?

40:38.617 --> 40:41.651
We're about two miles east
of the 180 interchange.

40:41.718 --> 40:43.317
Okay, I need you to exit

40:43.384 --> 40:46.384
at the 70, make
the first left.

40:46.451 --> 40:48.883
We'll have roadblocks set up
with a backup team ready

40:48.950 --> 40:50.883
to take Jack into custody
and recover the component.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.084
All right, we'll do that.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.950
You need to disarm Jack
as soon as quickly

40:54.017 --> 40:55.684
and quietly as possible
before he finds out.

40:55.751 --> 40:57.250
No problem.

41:00.351 --> 41:01.950
CTU's got a report
from Cal Trans.

41:02.017 --> 41:04.250
The 180's closed
due to high winds.

41:04.317 --> 41:06.417
They're concerned about
possible fallout.

41:06.484 --> 41:09.551
They want us to
take 70 instead.

41:09.617 --> 41:10.983
Fine.

41:11.950 --> 41:13.351
Don't you move.

41:14.651 --> 41:16.883
Jack, what's the problem ?

41:16.950 --> 41:18.117
Earlier today,

41:18.184 --> 41:21.284
I shot my old partner,
a friend of mine,

41:21.351 --> 41:24.184
because he tried to stop me
from doing what I have to do.

41:24.250 --> 41:27.050
Don't think for a second
I won't do that to you.

41:28.651 --> 41:30.050
Slowly I want you

41:30.117 --> 41:31.351
to pull over.

41:31.417 --> 41:32.883
Now.

42:08.983 --> 42:10.417
Take the keys
out of the ignition.

42:10.484 --> 42:12.883
Put them on the center
console. And your phone.

42:12.950 --> 42:14.651
Jack, you don't want
to do this.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.718
Slowly get out
of the truck.

42:25.784 --> 42:26.751
Back up towards
the fence.

42:26.818 --> 42:27.751
Jack, listen to me.

42:27.818 --> 42:29.284
Daniels is the acting president.

42:29.351 --> 42:30.784
He's the one who
called this off.

42:30.850 --> 42:32.684
Shut up and grab the fence !

42:32.751 --> 42:34.184
This is gonna end badly, Jack.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.150
You can't go against
the White House !

42:37.484 --> 42:38.484
Jack !

42:42.351 --> 42:43.751
Jack !
