- See you later, Phil.
- Pizza Girl's hot.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.268
- She likes you.
- No, she doesn't.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.706
Yes, you reclusive moron.
She does.

00:09.776 --> 00:12.142
What they say is true?
You don't leave.

00:12.245 --> 00:15.874
- Yes, it's true. I don't.
- You should ask me in sometime.

00:15.949 --> 00:19.476
Only reason I told you about me and
Owen's wife is you were leaving town.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.110
It was a one shot deal, right?

00:21.187 --> 00:23.747
No need to ruin a family
over one stupid night?

00:23.857 --> 00:27.554
- Want me to give you your own class?
- Just a little class.

00:27.627 --> 00:30.596
Aubrey, Hannah. Hannah, Aubrey.
Aubrey's one of my students.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.165
- [Nick] This girl? Very cool.
- [Lkey] And very hot.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.133
- She's my student, lkey.
- Who cares?

00:35.201 --> 00:38.830
- Hidden drama with Nick, you, and Sam.
- [Hannah] There's no hidden drama.

00:38.905 --> 00:42.136
- The boy. He has your mother's eyes.
- Sam has a peanut allergy.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.768
All the men in my family
have peanut allergies.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.345
- It's not that rare.
- It is.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.380
No. It's not.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.507
The whole time I was yelling at him,
all I wanted to do was kiss him.

00:51.584 --> 00:55.076
Hannah broke up with me.
She gave me every reason under the sun,

00:55.155 --> 00:56.918
except the real one, which is you.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.924
I am going to bury you, kid.

- Hey.

Listen...

01:36.162 --> 01:40.121
I wanted to apologize for the whole
"Rock The Stadium Of Her Heart" thing.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.169
That was a bit of a miscalculation
on my part.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.727
Yeah. Amanda didn't seem
to like it very much.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.297
No, no, she really didn't.

seemed to get a kick out of it.

Yeah. Speaking of options.

You know my mom broke up with Big Cat?

I heard.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.392
So maybe now you and her
could get together.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.953
- Like you did in high school.
- Um...

02:16.102 --> 02:19.799
I think your mom and I need to work on
becoming friends first, Sam.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.539
OK.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.818
Yep. And he's got
the peanut allergy to prove it.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.387
We gotta talk, bro.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.986
- About what?
- About The Commander.

02:45.064 --> 02:48.591
- What about him?
- I think he's dating.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.102
What? Dating? Like a woman?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.833
No, I know.
It'd be the first one since Ma died.

02:53.907 --> 02:57.536
You know, it's upsetting on many levels
too numerous to ponder.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.976
- There's no way.
- There's no way he's dating?

03:00.046 --> 03:02.014
No way you used the word "ponder."

03:02.081 --> 03:05.983
He's been acting weird.
I mean, going out at strange hours.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.816
Drenched in cologne.
There's no more gray in his hair.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.322
The other day,
he smiled on three occasions.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.824
- Whoa.
- Three occasions.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.019
- Three occasions.
- Oh, it gets worse.

- Hmm.
- The other night?

- Snippity-Loo'd me.
- He Snippity-Loo'd you?

03:21.501 --> 03:24.436
Nicky, the only times in recent memory
he's Snippity-Loo'd,

03:24.504 --> 03:27.268
is when the Sox won the Series,
the Pats won the Super Bowl,

03:27.340 --> 03:29.865

to make another Rocky.</i>

03:29.943 --> 03:31.911
The man doesn't Snippity-Loo anymore.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.469
He ain't got that much joy left.
I'm concerned.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.674
I think you're overreacting.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.842
Snippity-Loo, sons-o-mine!

03:38.918 --> 03:41.478
And may you both have
a dandy day at work.

03:59.639 --> 04:03.735
- I don't mean to intrude.
- What are you doing here?

04:03.810 --> 04:05.675
I just came to pick up my drill kit.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.044
I left it here the other day
when I hung those pictures for you.

04:09.115 --> 04:11.276
You should take
all your stuff at once, Ray.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.750
Instead of stopping by
in fits and starts.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.588
I think about you every minute.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.123
Every single minute.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.656
Last night I tried to go 60 seconds
without thinking about you,

04:28.735 --> 04:34.605
and then on the 49th second,
the way you look after a bath,

in that ratty robe you love.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.144

to the Barnstable Fair,

05:22.922 --> 05:26.221

- Terminating the account?
- What are you talking about?

Another company
made a crazy-low bid.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.784
- Crazy-low how?
- Like 600 a week.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.287
Half what you guys charge.

I did everything I could
to get them to keep you guys on.

qualify as feelings.

I don't understand why he can't
just tell me. Anything. Ever.

09:18.124 --> 09:21.753
If it makes you feel any better,
he never told me anything either.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.988
He had his appendix
out a few months ago.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.394

until three weeks later.

- OK.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.855
- So tell me, how could you?
- Which do you find more repulsive?

13:45.925 --> 13:50.487
- That I did it? Or who I did it with?
- Oh, it's a big both.

13:50.596 --> 13:53.759
You wrote a book in which
you made all your hometown friends

13:53.833 --> 13:55.130
look like buffoons.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.864
Then you turn around and find it odd
when they behave like buffoons?

13:58.938 --> 14:01.805
You weren't one of my hometown friends.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.833
Save your judgment, Nick, for someone
who cares whether or not you like them.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.709
I just wonder.
What did you get from lkey?

14:09.782 --> 14:12.250
- Excitement?
- No.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.450
Not excitement.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.984
Nick, I know this is something
you will never understand.

14:20.059 --> 14:23.290
But when you share everything
in your life with those you love,

14:23.362 --> 14:26.729
sometimes it's necessary
to have something just for yourself.

14:26.832 --> 14:31.132
Wow. Now there's a wonderful
little Möbius strip of logic.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.502
- It's the worst thing in the world.
- Yeah.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.598
I know that.

14:36.675 --> 14:40.042
Every time I see Owen's face,

14:40.145 --> 14:45.208
see him dancing with my children,
I know that.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.047

14:54.426 --> 14:56.986
You can't stop?

14:57.096 --> 14:59.963
Lkey told me it was a one-time thing.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.569
It was a one-time thing.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.632
A one-time thing that has lasted
for months and months and months.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.446

I love my children.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.038
This has nothing to do with them.

because of my inadequacies.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.488

I think it's
a very encouraging sign, Janet.

He wants his friends to know.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.966
And clearly the job is important.
And this pleases me.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.298
Oh, happy to oblige.

27:19.371 --> 27:23.137
Now, if it's all the same to you,
I'd like to continue seeing the girl.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.698
That's your choice, Nick.

27:24.776 --> 27:29.110
But all along Leslie has been trying
to gauge your commitment.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.647
This is amazing.

27:30.715 --> 27:33.809
Living in a world
where I'm being tested by you.

27:33.885 --> 27:37.651
And where you call her "Leslie."
That's mind-blowing.

27:37.722 --> 27:41.749
So that you know, Nick,
your father missed you terribly.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.123
And he was proud of you.

27:43.194 --> 27:47.324
All he wanted was to share in
your success and you weren't here.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.061
And you weren't at home.

27:53.972 --> 27:55.633
So you brought me back?

27:59.077 --> 28:02.911
The one day intensive.
The reason I came back home.

28:02.981 --> 28:06.815
You invited me to teach that
so that I could see my father again?

28:06.885 --> 28:09.649
It was more like
so he could see you again.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.449
Is this for real? Is he right?

28:11.523 --> 28:14.617
Well, I never dreamed you'd stay.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.390
But I was glad for that. And now look.
Look at the two of you together.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.226
Like it's supposed to be.

28:20.298 --> 28:23.461
You invited him to teach a class
just so he'd come back home?

28:23.535 --> 28:25.002
Of course, Robert.

28:25.070 --> 28:30.167
No offense, kids, but
I really didn't like the book at all.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.650
Whoever thought
Eddie Latekka and his monkey squad

28:44.756 --> 28:46.656
would turn me into a daytime lush?

28:46.725 --> 28:50.286
There's nothing to be nervous about.
What time is he picking you up?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.158
Fifteen minutes.

28:52.263 --> 28:56.324
Nine hundred precious seconds before
I make the dubious transformation

28:56.401 --> 28:59.893
from reliable barkeep
to knitting circle gossip fodder.

28:59.971 --> 29:03.930
- Yeah, well, welcome to my world.
- You know what the weirdest part is?

I'm really, really
looking forward to it.

to being deleted.

at eating cheeseburgers

- Oh, no, don't sweat it.

four times before our first date.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.528
- Four times?
- What is it with you boys?

30:01.599 --> 30:02.691
What?

30:02.767 --> 30:06.794
I think it's that the average penis
is comprised mostly of equal parts

30:06.871 --> 30:09.806

blood vessels and ambivalence.

that I'm at the bar, not at home.

30:36.801 --> 30:38.666
I hope you didn't go to my house.

OK. Bye!

Wow, you look lovely today.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.401
Sorry about you and Hannah.

31:16.474 --> 31:19.807
Yeah, well,
such are the risks that we take, right?

31:19.878 --> 31:23.712
I mean, we can wear our seat belts.
We can eat our vegetables.

31:23.781 --> 31:25.806
We can lather ourselves in sunscreen.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.250
But when it comes
to matters of the heart,

31:28.353 --> 31:31.220

32:07.926 --> 32:10.895
It's my fault. What was I thinking?

32:10.962 --> 32:13.123
He's Eddie Latekka.
I'm Janet Meadows.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.893
- The whole idea of it is absurd.
- Janet...

32:15.967 --> 32:17.935
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

32:18.803 --> 32:22.967
I was imagining how it would be,
walking into the barbecue with Eddie.

32:23.074 --> 32:26.441
How it would feel. Like a prom.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.307
Eddie puked the whole prom.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.877
Maybe it's not what it seems.
Maybe he didn't go.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.315
Maybe something came up.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.443
Maybe he doesn't
want to be seen with me.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.080
Janet, don't go there.
What we need is intel.

32:38.156 --> 32:42.286
