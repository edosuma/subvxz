00:32.531 --> 00:35.618
<i>At this point, you may think
you have put the pieces together.</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:37.662
<i>You may think you have your man.</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:40.874
<i>But you'd be wrong.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:44.169
They took both our laptops.
Clay's backpack.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.253
And my phone.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.257
And what, if anything,
will they find on your phone?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.386
A text to... to Bryce.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.554
Saying?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.224
Saying...

01:01.019 --> 01:02.062
Saying I wanna kill him.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.774
It was after Homecoming and everything,

01:05.857 --> 01:09.027
and I came home and I was sitting here
and I was mad, that's all.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.612
It was just words.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.279
And...

01:12.697 --> 01:14.240
I deleted them, but...

01:21.164 --> 01:22.164
I will...

01:22.499 --> 01:23.619
talk to Dennis this morning,

01:23.666 --> 01:26.086
and we will all sit down with him
after school.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.797
And you talk to no one about those texts.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.800
Or anything to do with the case.
Either of you.

01:34.677 --> 01:35.677
Clay,

01:36.221 --> 01:38.056
did Bryce do something to you? Did he...

01:38.807 --> 01:39.849
threaten you?

01:40.475 --> 01:42.811
Did he say something to you
on the field that night?

01:45.939 --> 01:46.939
No.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.901
Then why the text?

01:55.323 --> 01:58.284
<i>Clay wasn't the only one
without good answers.</i>

01:58.368 --> 02:01.246
I'm telling you,
the cops were looking through shit.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.539
At Monet's.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.541
They hit Clay and Justin's last night,

02:04.624 --> 02:07.561
and this morning, they were in the back
at Monet's turning everything over.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.146
So, they were just looking for anything
Justin might've had there.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.633
If they hit Monet's, they could come back
to the garage. It's only a matter of time.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.093
But what can we do?

02:16.177 --> 02:17.177
I can sell.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.681
I can sell for cash
and get the money to my dad.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.015
You can't wire that much.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.476
- I'll drive it down there.
- Tony, take a breath.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.855
- They have no reason to look at you again.
- They have every reason!

02:26.938 --> 02:30.138
I lied to Clay about seeing Bryce again.
You don't think he's gonna give that up?

02:30.191 --> 02:31.442
I don't see why he would.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.820
Because they're trying to frame him
for murder.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.823
You don't need to tear up your whole life
when nothing bad's happened yet.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.912
And when the cops ask you
where I was the night Bryce was killed?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.915
You were here, asleep, next to me.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.002
What if they find out the truth?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.798
<i>And there are secrets
that can't be kept any longer.</i>

02:57.677 --> 03:00.096
There are a few things I haven't told you.

03:00.763 --> 03:01.763
About Clay?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.017
About everyone.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.937
<i>Everyone had something to hide.</i>

03:10.773 --> 03:12.483
You don't really think it's Clay, do you?

03:14.652 --> 03:16.779
Can't talk about an ongoing investigation,
buddy.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.448
I know. It's just hard to believe.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.283
Is there, like, evidence?

03:20.366 --> 03:21.409
Buddy!

03:21.492 --> 03:23.328
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.705
Clay's a good friend,
of course you're worried.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.081
Yeah, he just...

03:27.457 --> 03:29.497
I can't think of how
he could do anything like that.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.003
I mean, it's just not who he is.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.215
We don't always know
what people are capable of.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.008
Yeah, I guess.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.388
So, you and Clay...

03:43.723 --> 03:46.517
did you guys spend much time together
at the Homecoming game?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.979
I saw him on the field in the fight.
That's about it.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.063
Mmm.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.651
Remind me again what you did
after the game,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.014
after your mom brought you home.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.196
Yeah, I was hanging out with Jessica.

03:58.988 --> 03:59.988
Right.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.201
Right, Jessica.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.150
<i>It was a short call.</i>

04:07.664 --> 04:10.375
He mostly wanted me to verify
where you were Homecoming night.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.795
I told him after I picked you up
you went straight to bed.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.838
You <i>were </i> home in bed, correct?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.382
Dad, you tucked me in.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.718
But why are you even worried about this?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.888
Well, apparently,
Bryce sent you a text that night?

04:24.639 --> 04:28.142
Yeah, I ignored it.
I think he texted a lot of Liberty kids.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.788
They went through Clay Jensen's phone.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.438
They found several messages
between the two of you that night.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.232
Yeah, Dad, me and Clay text a lot,

04:34.315 --> 04:37.860
and it was a crazy night,
so obviously we texted.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.029
From right here, in my bed.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.573
Why?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.118
What do they think?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.662
Well, from what I understand,

04:47.745 --> 04:50.665
they're just trying to put together
Clay's whereabouts that night

04:50.748 --> 04:51.749
after the game.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.002
Oh.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.256
Maybe you shouldn't be texting him
so much anymore.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.157
All right, partner, let's go.
You're gonna be late for school.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.182
<i>Jessica had good reason to worry,
it would turn out.</i>

05:09.684 --> 05:10.810
<i>But so did Monty,</i>

05:11.352 --> 05:13.771
<i>who truly felt like
his own life was on the line.</i>

05:23.906 --> 05:25.466
The cops called again.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.369
About what?

05:28.453 --> 05:29.704
Same thing as before.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.873
Where you were Homecoming night.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.293
- What'd you tell 'em?
- Same thing as before.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.378
Is it the truth?

05:37.462 --> 05:40.340
Yes! Yes, of course.
I was... I was at Charlie's.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.548
You sleep there?

05:42.216 --> 05:44.302
Yeah. A bunch of guys did.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.263
Bunch of guys.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.602
<i>One phone call,</i>

05:53.269 --> 05:54.269
<i>one question,</i>

05:55.313 --> 05:57.648
<i>and the whole life
you've built out of lies</i>

05:57.732 --> 05:59.817
<i>starts to come crashing down around you.</i>

06:01.152 --> 06:02.695
Mum, it's just paint.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.467
We were doing a mural for history class.
I was gonna take it to the dry cleaner's.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.331
You wore this the night
of the Homecoming game.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.037
The night of that vulgar display
on the field.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.209
How do you know about that?

06:16.292 --> 06:18.336
It was the headline of the newspaper
that weekend.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.921
Now I know you were there.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.589
Fully participating.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.341
- No, I didn't.
- You lied to me.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.635
Not only did you lie to me,

06:25.718 --> 06:27.970
you made a liar of me
in front of my employer.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.306
You were there to spend time
with Bryce Walker.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.016
What? What on earth...

06:32.100 --> 06:33.100
I know...

06:33.142 --> 06:34.894
the underwear in his room
was yours.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.732
A mother knows when her daughter
has opened her life to a man.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.526
- A mother knows!
- Mum, please!

06:41.609 --> 06:43.986
My employer's son?
You have lost yourself!

06:44.070 --> 06:46.239
- It wasn't anything like that...
- Do you understand

06:46.656 --> 06:48.032
that by having relations with him,

06:48.116 --> 06:50.236
you were endangering our livelihood
in this household?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.120
And by lying to the police,

06:52.370 --> 06:54.872
you are endangering our presence
in this country?

06:59.043 --> 07:01.546
- Amorowat, do you understand?
- Mum, please. Look...

07:01.629 --> 07:03.131
none of this has to get out.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.674
Nora doesn't know.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.194
And Bryce promised me that
he wouldn't say anything to anyone.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.178
- How can you be certain he didn't?
- I just know!

07:09.220 --> 07:10.221
How do you know?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.779
What do you know
about what happened to him?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.231
What else are you not telling?

07:20.731 --> 07:22.233
Nothing. I...

07:24.652 --> 07:27.321
It's just that Bryce promised me
that he would keep it a secret,

07:27.405 --> 07:29.574
and... and Bryce wasn't a liar.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.244
But my daughter is.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.557
Amorowat, I can handle the laundry.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.476
Let me just help with this before I go.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.270
You need to eat. I can finish myself.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.027
Good morning.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.488
God damn it, Ani, I need you. No!

08:10.239 --> 08:11.491
How is everybody today?

08:11.574 --> 08:12.700
Fine, thank you.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.702
I should head off.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.412
You need to finish your breakfast.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.582
Bryce, in a moment
I have to make eggs for your grandfather.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.666
Would you like some?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.167
Um...

08:22.210 --> 08:24.253
I'll just... I'll grab something. Thanks.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.344
We found some things of yours
outside by the pool.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.554
- In case you were looking for them.
- Yeah, thank you.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.313
And I'm sorry,
I think I had a little too much to drink.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.651
Did you?

08:48.027 --> 08:49.027
I'm actually...

08:49.362 --> 08:50.947
Well, it's...

08:52.031 --> 08:54.351
probably something
I need to do a little soul-searching on.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.411
I tend to do stupid things when I drink,

08:57.745 --> 09:00.414
which I regret later.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.875
Yeah. Well, it's, um...
it's none of my business.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.672
Aren't you running a bit late?

09:09.882 --> 09:13.553
Bryce, your mother asked you
to stop by the studio before school.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.223
Right, yeah. She's finally got it
up and running. I will. Thanks.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.611
Breathe out.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.199
She's just so focused. It's amazing.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.743
Excuse me.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.329
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.748
Oh!

09:43.082 --> 09:45.251
Didn't realize you were going
to have kids here, too.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.334
Oh!

09:46.627 --> 09:48.963
Yes, it's very good for children.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.008
Yoga teaches kids self-regulation,

09:52.174 --> 09:55.678
to let emotions pass through their bodies
without attachment.

09:56.178 --> 10:00.808
That emotions are just information for us
to understand ourselves more deeply.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.102
Something I could've used
when I was their age.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.313
I didn't know all this back then.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.606
No, I didn't mean...

10:07.064 --> 10:10.026
- It just seems nice, is all.
- Oh.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.029
Who knows, maybe I can bring
my own kids here someday.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.780
Your own kids?

10:14.864 --> 10:15.865
I don't know.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.909
You wanted me to stop by?

10:20.077 --> 10:22.413
The dean at Hillcrest called me
this morning.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.999
- Why?
- It seems your grades have recovered

10:25.082 --> 10:26.083
since last year.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.668
More than recovered.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.289
He wanted me to know
that you'll make the Dean's List.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.757
Do you think...

10:34.425 --> 10:37.303
I don't know, I've had this kind of...
crazy hope

10:37.386 --> 10:39.472
that maybe I could transfer
back to Liberty

10:39.555 --> 10:40.848
for spring semester.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.810
- But you're doing so well at Hillcrest.
- Everybody hates me there.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.894
And I... I just...

10:46.687 --> 10:49.315
I really want to play baseball
with those guys one last time.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.025
I see.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.905
- Well, it could be complicated.
- I know.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.823
It's never gonna happen.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.409
I just thought that maybe I could...

11:01.202 --> 11:03.079
set things right somehow.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.209
Anyway, I should...
I should probably get going.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.544
Gotta keep those grades up.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.797
Congratulations on the opening, Mom.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.299
- The place is beautiful, really.
- Thank you.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.769
<i>Mrs. Walker made that phone call
a few days before Homecoming.</i>

11:28.437 --> 11:32.066
<i>And it would set in motion a chain
of events that would lead to murder.</i>

11:35.695 --> 11:36.696
Hello, Sheriff.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.573
You did?

11:41.659 --> 11:42.868
And what did you find?

11:48.457 --> 11:50.167
And when did he send those texts?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.715
I see.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.177
Now, what happens next?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.889
<i>Because everything affects everything.</i>

12:04.473 --> 12:05.808
They're coming after you.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.060
- Maybe.
- You said

12:08.144 --> 12:09.937
if Bryce knew about what Monty did to me,

12:10.020 --> 12:12.481
it might give them reason
to go after Monty instead.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.899
I know what I said, but...

12:15.192 --> 12:16.569
But don't worry about that, okay?

12:16.986 --> 12:20.114
But if I told what I know, like, my story,
wouldn't it help?

12:21.031 --> 12:22.408
Not if it doesn't help you.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.034
If you're in trouble,

12:24.160 --> 12:25.828
if they have you under oath
or whatever,

12:25.911 --> 12:28.581
- then you might have to tell them...
- I won't. I won't.

12:29.665 --> 12:30.665
I promise.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.251
But...

12:35.337 --> 12:37.131
I might not be around all the time.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.218
You should think about...

12:41.969 --> 12:43.679
if you wanna talk to someone else.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.850
I feel like Jessica might understand.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.104
And you... might not be around.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.565
Yeah.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.990
I just can't believe Clay Jensen.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.659
- He seems like a good guy.
- He's a little asshole.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.912
Yeah, but he wouldn't kill someone.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.663
Cops think otherwise.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.064
What do you think they have on him?

13:12.541 --> 13:15.211
Cops think Bryce was killed
a few hours after the Homecoming game.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.338
Clay's got no one that can vouch
for where he was.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.341
Good thing I was getting shit-faced
at Charlie's house.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.051
Yeah.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.469
Totally.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.139
Where were you, Zachy?

13:27.389 --> 13:28.390
I was with a friend.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.599
Who?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.560
None of your fucking business.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.689
<i>And as Alex said,</i>

13:36.482 --> 13:37.483
<i>nobody's clean.</i>

13:42.029 --> 13:42.863
Hey.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.574
You don't think the cops are going
to talk to us again, do you?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.493
Why would they?

13:47.576 --> 13:49.537
Well, I mean,
seems like they're making a big deal

13:49.620 --> 13:53.040
- about where people were after the game.
- So let 'em. We're cool, right?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.750
Right. Yeah.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.834
Of course.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.339
You didn't talk to Bryce, right?

14:01.757 --> 14:03.676
Like, that night after the game?

14:04.134 --> 14:05.469
I told you I didn't.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.762
Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.182
So, leave it alone. We're good.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.939
<i>After what happened at Homecoming,
you promised you'd tone it down.</i>

14:17.398 --> 14:19.108
I don't remember making that promise.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.820
I warned you to stop the funeral protests
or you'd be held responsible.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.364
So, I guess I'm here
to be held responsible.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.301
I spoke with the superintendent
this morning and this is what we decided:

14:28.325 --> 14:30.035
we're calling an assembly tomorrow.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.287
In addition to our students,

14:31.370 --> 14:33.956
the Hillcrest football team and coaches
will be in attendance,

14:34.331 --> 14:36.625
and you will make a public apology.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.085
I will?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.172
- Or?
- Or the logical next step

14:42.298 --> 14:43.632
is to remove you as president.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.343
In the best interest of the student body.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.472
Everything I have done has been
in the best interest of the student body.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
Tell me, Miss Davis,

14:52.558 --> 14:53.893
these stunts you pulled...

14:54.727 --> 14:56.103
do you think they worked?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.272
Are the students better off
because of them?

14:58.355 --> 14:59.648
- I do.
- Mmm.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.442
I think people are talking about it.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.152
But beyond that, what?

15:04.528 --> 15:06.363
Make the apology, move on.

15:06.447 --> 15:10.784
Now is not the time in this town
to be the nail sticking out of the board.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.581
<i>Jessica had started
with the best of intentions,</i>

15:15.915 --> 15:18.375
<i>but you know what they say
about the road to hell.</i>

15:18.792 --> 15:20.628
Principal Bolan, I was elected president

15:20.711 --> 15:22.963
on the promise of ending boys' sports
at Liberty.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.132
Canceling the game will send a message.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.342
Yes, I know your reasoning.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.053
My secretary transcribed 47 voicemails

15:29.136 --> 15:32.306
from your supporters
and showed me your online petition.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.308
The fact is Homecoming is a tradition.

15:34.391 --> 15:37.227
- You just ignored everything!
- Homecoming is a tradition,

15:37.311 --> 15:40.105
and is not in itself a contributor
to sexual assault.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.482
And if this game gets canceled,

15:41.565 --> 15:44.360
I promise you
no one will take it the way you intend.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.905
That petition was signed
by over a third of the student body.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.531
And are all of them fully aware of

15:49.615 --> 15:51.408
your personal relationship
with Bryce Walker?

15:51.492 --> 15:52.493
I don't have...

15:54.161 --> 15:56.622
This isn't about Bryce Walker.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.517
What if I told you I received a phone call
from his mother this morning

15:59.541 --> 16:02.503
inquiring about re-enrolling him
for the spring semester?

16:03.879 --> 16:04.879
What?

16:07.007 --> 16:08.342
You're letting him come back?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.552
We've only just received the request,
but...

16:10.886 --> 16:11.929
He raped me.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.347
And if he returns...

16:14.264 --> 16:16.684
we will take every measure
to ensure your safety.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.561
What about the safety
of every other girl at Liberty?

16:19.645 --> 16:22.064
- It is our utmost concern.
- No, it isn't.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.401
If it was, you would've canceled
boys' sports years ago.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.945
<i>He ignored everything.</i>

16:28.988 --> 16:31.156
- Such bullshit.
- No more wasting our time.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.158
We need to do something huge.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.411
- Yeah, we do.
- The Homecoming game's in two days.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.538
We need to get in there
and get our message out.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.831
Like, posters at the game?

16:38.914 --> 16:40.249
- Fuck posters!
- Okay.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.333
Bigger than that.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.294
We need to show everyone
that we are done

16:44.378 --> 16:45.587
being silent victims.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.841
That they're going to face our anger
whether they want to or not.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.050
Yeah!

16:50.134 --> 16:51.343
- Okay.
- So, like,

16:52.136 --> 16:54.513
we'll be out there
in front of all the football players?

16:54.596 --> 16:56.265
In front of the whole wide world.

16:59.977 --> 17:00.978
Yes!

17:01.562 --> 17:04.982
Love it when you get fired up!
This is why we elected you!

17:06.066 --> 17:10.154
<i>♪ Hey man, what are you doin' tonight? ♪</i>

17:12.906 --> 17:17.118
<i>♪ How about me and you goin' for a ride? ♪</i>

17:17.786 --> 17:19.872
Are you gonna come watch me play
the Homecoming game?

17:19.954 --> 17:21.915
Why do you always want to talk?

17:25.752 --> 17:27.628
Seriously, Jess?

17:27.713 --> 17:30.549
It would mean a lot to me
if you were there. You gonna come?

17:34.094 --> 17:35.094
What?

17:36.847 --> 17:42.102
I'll... I'll be at the game, I'm just
not really coming to watch... exactly.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.231
- Then what are you coming to do?
- I can't tell you.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.318
What, like, you guys are going
to bomb the game or something?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.500
You aren't going to bomb the game,
are you?

17:53.530 --> 17:57.284
No, but we do have something planned.
I just can't tell you, okay?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.078
- Why not?
- Listen,

17:59.578 --> 18:01.121
this thing is bigger than me.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.874
I need you to respect that, okay?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.549
Why is the door locked?
Why are we even in here?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.380
We're not a secret anymore.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.386
Listen, I've been thinking
about my activism,

18:16.470 --> 18:20.349
and what I've been putting people through
and what I've been putting you through.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.019
And Bolan just gave me
this ultimatum, and...

18:24.478 --> 18:26.355
I'm starting to feel like he's right.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.109
This is a bad time for me to start
drawing attention to myself.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.654
Why is it a bad time for you?

18:36.448 --> 18:39.368
I told Ani that you and I were together
after Homecoming.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.954
She was starting to get suspicious

18:42.037 --> 18:44.039
and I just wanted to protect you.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.417
- I didn't ask you to do that for me.
- I know, I know.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.794
Okay? I panicked.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.881
Really, I was home in bed,
and that's what my dad told the cops,

18:52.965 --> 18:56.593
which is why
I can't be getting in any more trouble.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.096
If they start looking at me,

18:59.179 --> 19:00.931
if they start asking questions...

19:01.765 --> 19:03.767
it could be really bad for you.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.186
You need to get your alibi straight.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.398
I just... I just don't understand.
Why did you lie to Ani?

19:09.481 --> 19:10.983
Why are you just telling me this now?

19:11.066 --> 19:13.485
Because there's a lot going on, Justin.
Can't you tell?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.697
I'm just trying to help you.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.449
Yeah, right.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.452
Got it.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.707
God!

19:28.125 --> 19:29.543
Jess. Jess!

19:31.003 --> 19:33.338
<i>She was probably trying
to protect you, right?</i>

19:33.839 --> 19:36.860
But now she's totally changed her story.
I mean, she's saying she was in bed,

19:36.884 --> 19:39.178
but I have five, like, missed calls
from her that night.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.346
- Did she leave you messages?
- Yeah.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.110
Just "Call me back," but it wasn't like...

19:43.348 --> 19:45.601
"Hey, I'm in bed.
Come sneak in through the window."

19:45.684 --> 19:47.561
It was like,
"Call me back. I need something."

19:51.148 --> 19:54.026
The other day, did the cops ask you
about where you were that night?

19:55.485 --> 19:56.528
Kind of. Just...

19:58.197 --> 19:59.781
I told them that I was at home.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.409
Should we tell them
that we were together?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.411
And did anyone see you that night?

20:05.787 --> 20:07.039
Just the dealer I bought from.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.791
So if we lie, and then...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.440
the cops pick him up at any point,
then our story falls apart.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.048
<i>Tell the police everything.</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:20.219
About me and Bryce,
about why you texted what you did.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.221
I won't do that to you.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.014
Mum already knows everything.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.142
- I think maybe she always did, so...
- She does?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.479
- What did she say?
- A lot.

20:31.688 --> 20:32.689
And then nothing.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.652
So, when you texted
and said you wanted to help,

20:36.735 --> 20:38.320
it's just because your mom found out?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.405
No, it's because I believe you.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.036
And I believe
you're in a very dangerous moment,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.618
and I think you should tell the police

20:44.701 --> 20:47.287
everything you know about everyone,
starting with me.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.141
No. Look, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna ruin people I care about

20:50.165 --> 20:52.793
- when they didn't do anything.
- How do you know they didn't?

20:59.258 --> 21:02.261
Did Jessica tell you she was with Justin
the night of Homecoming?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.513
Yeah... why?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.807
Justin says that isn't true.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.977
He was alone,
scoring drugs and getting high.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.063
And you believe him?

21:13.146 --> 21:16.358
I mean, it fucks up a lot for him to
admit that, so I don't know why he'd lie.

21:17.859 --> 21:18.860
But why would Jessica?

21:20.737 --> 21:24.366
Jessica wasn't angry with me
because I ditched her at Homecoming.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.952
She was angry because...

21:27.744 --> 21:29.955
Bryce told me to leave, and I went.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.379
- Have you talked to her about it?
- Not yet.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.593
<i>Watching what Clay went through,
I thought...</i>

21:45.595 --> 21:49.558
"It's surprisingly easy
to make an innocent person look guilty."

21:49.975 --> 21:52.269
He didn't act like an innocent person.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.979
Do you blame him?

21:54.354 --> 21:56.690
<i>We pulled all the data
that the police will have.</i>

21:56.773 --> 21:58.275
We need to know what they know.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.361
Now, after you sent the text messages
to Bryce,

22:01.862 --> 22:03.530
you received a phone call
from Mrs. Baker.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.866
- You didn't pick up.
- I was driving.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.161
She left you a voicemail.
Which the police <i>will </i> access.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.706
She was drunk.

22:12.789 --> 22:16.585
She was... at Hannah's grave,
and she was drunk and she was sad.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.837
And did she talk about Bryce?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.382
Yes.

22:23.842 --> 22:24.842
She...

22:25.427 --> 22:26.803
talked about wanting him dead.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.670
Why aren't they looking at her?

22:29.723 --> 22:32.059
I assume that they have.
Maybe they still are, but...

22:33.268 --> 22:36.348
can you give us anything more that might
make Olivia Baker a credible suspect?

22:36.938 --> 22:37.938
No.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.568
Clay, do you understand
how cell phone towers work?

22:43.445 --> 22:44.613
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.907
So you understand that
when you place a call,

22:47.115 --> 22:50.327
your phone pings the nearest tower
to give you the best reception?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.287
Yes.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.664
This is the tower
that your text to Bryce pinged

22:54.956 --> 22:56.458
and the range that it covers.

22:56.958 --> 22:57.958
Uh-huh.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.380
This is Bryce Walker's house.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.966
Were...
were you at his house, Clay?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.139
Your missed phone call from Mrs. Baker

23:11.223 --> 23:14.101
pinged this tower, which covers this area
along the waterfront.

23:15.435 --> 23:17.229
Why were you near the waterfront?

23:20.315 --> 23:23.193
- I was just driving randomly.
- Yeah, so you said.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.780
But this location,
well within the range of this tower,

23:27.406 --> 23:28.824
is where Bryce's body was found.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.912
That... that doesn't make any sense.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.914
We need to start making it make sense.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.252
Because I imagine
that the prosecutors already have.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.348
I've never seen that before.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.434
I don't juice.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.018
I've passed every drug test.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.604
- He's telling the truth. He's clean.
- Yeah.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.317
- Right. So they belong to Clay?
- No.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.946
No, that's not possible.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.700
Look, son, we found these buried
in a dresser drawer between your beds.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.994
So, either you put them there or Clay did.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.245
Which is it?

24:17.539 --> 24:18.819
Maybe he's holding for a friend.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.626
What friend?

24:26.214 --> 24:28.175
<i>But here's another question for you...</i>

24:29.593 --> 24:31.636
<i>How does a guilty person act?</i>

24:32.512 --> 24:34.055
<i>How about an innocent person?</i>

24:38.518 --> 24:40.270
Dude, I thought we said
we'd keep it light.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.396
This <i>is </i> light!

24:47.277 --> 24:49.696
Hey, Alex! What are you doing?

24:50.363 --> 24:51.698
Working out, Dad.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.742
- Well, get the hell out of there.
- In a minute!

24:53.825 --> 24:54.910
No, not in a minute!

24:55.994 --> 24:58.455
Right goddamn now. Stop it!
What did I tell you? Come here.

24:58.538 --> 24:59.706
I said in a minute!

25:00.248 --> 25:03.168
- I'm sorry, he said it was okay.
- Come here. What are you doing?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.504
Hey! Stop it! Stop it!

25:05.587 --> 25:08.590
- Let me go!
- Stop it. Stop it!

25:09.257 --> 25:10.550
- Stop it!
- I fucking hate you!

25:11.510 --> 25:12.385
Calm down.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.762
Calm down!

25:13.845 --> 25:15.847
What in the hell are you thinking, kid?

25:16.348 --> 25:17.348
Huh?

25:17.557 --> 25:21.394
One bad hit and you never walk again.
You never speak. Is that what you want?

25:22.103 --> 25:23.103
Maybe.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.319
You don't mean that. Come on.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.248
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.379
It's okay.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.842
Let's go home, buddy. Okay? Come on.

25:53.969 --> 25:54.969
Sorry.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.221
Come on.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.476
- Hey.
- Hey!

26:01.893 --> 26:03.937
Are you going to HO?
I just need to pack up.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.647
That's actually why I found you.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.690
Um...

26:08.400 --> 26:10.360
you should probably skip today.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.697
I'm gonna be pissing everyone off
in a big way.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.030
Again?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.534
Bolan's making me apologize.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.912
In front of an assembly,
and Hillcrest is coming.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.207
- You're kidding?
- Sadly, not kidding.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.503
Anyway, Casey and everyone else
will lose their shit when I tell them,

26:28.587 --> 26:31.631
and I know you've only been going
to those meetings to support me.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.550
And that means so much to me,

26:33.800 --> 26:37.762
- but I'm now a total failure, so...
- No, you're not!

26:38.930 --> 26:39.930
You're sweet.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.768
In the end,
I didn't change a goddamn thing.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.645
You changed a lot.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.607
You changed me.

26:48.898 --> 26:49.898
Yeah?

26:51.234 --> 26:54.404
Well, I made you an ally.
I guess that's something.

26:57.907 --> 26:58.907
I, um...

27:00.076 --> 27:02.078
I'm... more than an ally.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.624
What?

27:08.209 --> 27:09.209
What do you mean?

27:11.796 --> 27:12.797
It's just...

27:15.967 --> 27:18.094
Do you remember last summer
at the Crestmont?

27:20.013 --> 27:21.723
You asked me why I...

27:24.267 --> 27:26.519
Everything that happened at Spring Fling.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.271
Yeah.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.443
Can I...

27:36.071 --> 27:37.530
Can I show you something?

27:40.575 --> 27:41.575
Sure.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.289
<i>And then they dropped me on the floor,</i>

27:46.998 --> 27:50.126
<i>and left me there in the toilet water
in my own blood.</i>

27:50.794 --> 27:51.795
<i>And that was that.</i>

27:52.253 --> 27:54.005
<i>That was the worst of it. But...</i>

27:55.674 --> 27:57.467
<i>But it feels like I've been hurting, like,</i>

27:58.259 --> 27:59.469
<i>cut and bleeding</i>

27:59.886 --> 28:01.429
<i>every day since I was 12.</i>

28:02.347 --> 28:03.765
<i>I feel rejected.</i>

28:06.267 --> 28:07.977
<i>Not just alone, but rejected.</i>

28:09.229 --> 28:10.313
<i>Like I am nothing.</i>

28:11.606 --> 28:12.606
<i>No one.</i>

28:13.316 --> 28:14.859
<i>And my life is meaningless.</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:17.946
<i>I don't think
it's ever going to be any different.</i>

28:19.364 --> 28:21.241
<i>That school is never going to change.</i>

28:22.283 --> 28:24.327
<i>I'm sorry I have so much rage.</i>

28:25.453 --> 28:26.621
<i>I wasn't born with it.</i>

28:30.458 --> 28:31.543
<i>To everyone I love...</i>

28:33.586 --> 28:35.338
<i>I'm really sorry about all of this.</i>

28:37.298 --> 28:38.299
<i>Mom and Dad...</i>

28:40.260 --> 28:41.594
<i>you've been great parents.</i>

28:43.638 --> 28:44.639
<i>You really have.</i>

28:45.515 --> 28:46.516
<i>You did your best.</i>

28:49.018 --> 28:50.018
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:52.439 --> 28:53.439
<i>Alex...</i>

28:54.107 --> 28:56.860
<i>thank you for being the only one
who was ever nice to me.</i>

28:58.778 --> 29:00.029
<i>To everyone hearing this...</i>

29:02.115 --> 29:03.366
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

29:05.368 --> 29:06.368
<i>That's it.</i>

29:08.329 --> 29:09.329
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

29:11.374 --> 29:12.374
<i>Goodbye.</i>

29:22.385 --> 29:23.385
Tyler...

29:25.597 --> 29:26.848
I'm so sorry.

29:29.809 --> 29:33.271
I'm so sorry that this happened to you,
and I'm...

29:33.354 --> 29:36.316
I'm so, so sorry that I didn't know.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.066
It's okay.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.653
How would you know?

29:43.948 --> 29:44.948
That kid...

29:48.244 --> 29:49.829
That kid's not you anymore.

29:51.706 --> 29:52.916
You see that, right?

29:54.918 --> 29:55.918
Yeah.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.171
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting better.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.256
Like you.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.883
Yeah, just like me.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.348
I mean...

30:10.141 --> 30:13.186
I should've seen the signs,
you know? I should've...

30:15.605 --> 30:17.607
Maybe they're different for guys.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.276
Maybe.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.367
Have you told anyone else?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.661
Um, I told Clay.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.246
Um...

30:32.288 --> 30:33.915
I might tell Dr. Singh.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.168
She's... she's pretty good at her job.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.253
She is.

30:39.879 --> 30:40.922
You should tell her.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.261
I told...

30:48.054 --> 30:49.054
Bryce.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.267
What?

30:55.895 --> 30:57.814
Why... why would you tell Bryce?

30:59.983 --> 31:03.653
Um... well, at first I thought
that he told...

31:04.821 --> 31:06.364
told Monty to do it.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.617
But then,

31:09.701 --> 31:12.704
he... he wanted to help.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.833
What are you doing here?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.001
I came to talk.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.462
I took a guess
that you'd be in the yearbook room.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.840
I'm sorry.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.885
About the motel. I was in...

31:26.968 --> 31:28.678
Dude, it's okay. It's okay.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.807
But... but that's why I'm here.

31:35.351 --> 31:39.522
You said that Monty did something to you,
and tried to blame it on me.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.231
Nothing.

31:41.816 --> 31:45.236
- It was... Really, it was nothing.
- Tyler, you almost shot me.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.906
I'm really convinced it wasn't nothing.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.536
Did it have anything to do
with Spring Fling?

31:54.245 --> 31:55.245
With...

31:55.997 --> 31:59.083
- With what you were gonna do that night?
- I don't...

32:01.127 --> 32:03.171
I kind of just want to forget about it.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.465
Listen...

32:06.841 --> 32:10.219
This may be impossible
for you to believe, but...

32:11.512 --> 32:12.512
I'm on your side.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.141
I'm trying to set some things right

32:15.224 --> 32:17.644
that I made wrong,
and one of those is Monty.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.065
I can't...

32:24.692 --> 32:25.777
talk to you about it.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.284
I can show you something.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.206
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

32:39.999 --> 32:40.999
<i>That's it.</i>

32:43.086 --> 32:44.086
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

32:46.005 --> 32:47.005
<i>Goodbye.</i>

32:55.556 --> 32:56.724
I have to do something.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.601
Please don't say anything.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.687
To Monty or anyone.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.856
It'll only make things worse.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.986
Because you have to go to school
with him every day.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.987
Yes.

33:10.989 --> 33:11.989
Yeah.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.536
What is that like for you?

33:17.829 --> 33:20.498
I mean, I'm doing better. But...

33:21.541 --> 33:22.625
every time I see him,

33:24.127 --> 33:25.628
it's like part of me is...

33:27.005 --> 33:28.089
is back there.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.801
I mean, at first,

33:33.094 --> 33:34.679
it was all I could think about.

33:35.972 --> 33:39.100
It was just replaying over and over again
in my head.

33:40.226 --> 33:44.105
Now, I can get my mind on other things.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.736
But if I have a minute to drift...

33:53.031 --> 33:54.073
the memory...

33:55.825 --> 33:57.243
it's always there.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.536
Waiting.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.545
- We have to tell the police.
- No!

34:10.005 --> 34:11.005
No.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.800
Please.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.138
- Please don't make me tell anyone.
- Okay.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.723
I get it. I get it.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.150
What if I could make it
so you're not afraid anymore?

34:31.444 --> 34:34.197
I mean, look,
I can't take those memories away from you.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.199
And I can't get rid of Monty.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.870
But I think I can make it better for you.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.208
I can make it so you're not afraid of him
ever again.

34:50.295 --> 34:53.424
<i>Tyler, it's Bryce. Walker.</i>

34:54.592 --> 34:58.429
<i>Listen, that thing we talked about,
I'm dealing with it.</i>

34:59.430 --> 35:00.431
<i>You're all good.</i>

35:01.349 --> 35:02.725
<i>Take care of yourself, man.</i>

35:06.938 --> 35:08.481
So, what if he told Monty?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.900
And Monty did something to him?

35:10.983 --> 35:12.693
We don't know that's what happened,
though.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.445
But they'll have to look at him.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.614
And it'll help Clay's lawyers.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.743
It'll be like an alternate theory
of the case. I looked it up.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.123
Are you ready to tell the police?

35:28.334 --> 35:29.335
I don't know.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.378
Listen...

35:31.879 --> 35:34.132
you only tell your story
when you're ready.

35:34.715 --> 35:35.715
Okay?

35:36.509 --> 35:37.509
And when you are,

35:37.552 --> 35:38.678
I'm here for you.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.346
Always.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.308
Okay.

35:47.186 --> 35:49.605
<i>You say Clay was acting
out of character.</i>

35:51.107 --> 35:52.567
<i>Well, he wasn't the only one.</i>

35:53.609 --> 35:54.944
Hey, man. What's up?

35:55.653 --> 35:58.990
Hey. Is... Is Alex here?

35:59.282 --> 36:03.578
No. I think he was here earlier,
but I haven't seen him. I just got here.

36:04.036 --> 36:07.081
- Okay. I thought he might be working out.
- No.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.750
No football today?

36:10.001 --> 36:13.421
Oh, no, only so many practices
you can stand around and watch.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.714
Well,

36:15.173 --> 36:17.341
feel free to work out on anything.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.467
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.261
Hey. Crazy shit...

36:21.679 --> 36:22.679
about, um...

36:24.807 --> 36:25.807
about Clay.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.561
Uh, yeah, it's crazy.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.232
Yeah, I just, I mean...
Did he say anything to you about it?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.277
We haven't talked in a bit.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.570
Yeah, me either.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.948
Not that we really did, but...

36:46.245 --> 36:49.582
You don't think that he actually did it,
do you?

36:51.417 --> 36:53.628
No. I know in my heart he...

36:54.462 --> 36:55.796
never could.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.925
Yeah. I know.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.136
I know in my heart, too.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.891
But anyway, so... Thanks.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.309
I'll see ya.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.102
See you.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.654
Hey. You okay?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.243
I don't think so.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.497
I think I'm not okay, right?

37:29.580 --> 37:30.873
We're gonna get through this,

37:35.711 --> 37:36.711
My search terms.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.546
What?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.467
Dennis is trying to catch up
with the cops.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.386
He had me run my search history.

37:44.470 --> 37:45.470
Shit!

37:46.347 --> 37:48.266
This is some really dark stuff, dude.

37:48.766 --> 37:49.766
I...

37:52.144 --> 37:54.897
Don't ever tell anyone this.
I write fan fiction.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.984
You have to kill a character sometimes.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.521
- Okay, why don't you just tell them that?
- They can put me at the crime scene.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.404
- I've got no one to say I wasn't there.
- Fuck it. I'm saying I was with you.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.205
- They'll find out the truth. They will.
- No, they won't.

38:13.874 --> 38:14.874
Fuck!

38:30.558 --> 38:31.559
Hey, Monty.

38:32.935 --> 38:35.187
- What the fuck do you want?
- What's your deal?

38:36.063 --> 38:36.939
What do you mean?

38:37.023 --> 38:38.024
What's your deal?

38:39.233 --> 38:40.860
Why do you hurt people?

38:42.361 --> 38:44.572
- Is this about football?
- No, it's about you.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.532
Why are you so cruel?

38:46.824 --> 38:47.824
I'm not cruel.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.828
There's something seriously fucked up
about you,

38:50.911 --> 38:53.289
and I really wish
you could tell me what it is.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.791
I had a bad childhood.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.878
Yeah, maybe that's part of it.
But what else?

39:01.797 --> 39:03.299
Or were you always like this?

39:03.466 --> 39:04.884
Look, what the fuck?

39:05.634 --> 39:08.304
- What do you want?
- I think I just want to understand.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.682
- I think I never will.
- You're a crazy bitch.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.351
Yeah.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.064
And you should fear that.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.328
And so the locker room is perfect,

39:32.411 --> 39:35.664
because if we confront the jocks
in their precious sanctuary...

39:35.748 --> 39:36.748
Hey.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.419
What?

39:41.587 --> 39:45.591
I'm not here to ask for my place back,
I'm just asking for you to hear me out.

39:51.305 --> 39:54.725
It's important to make a mess,
to make noise, you're right.

39:56.018 --> 39:57.395
But I don't know.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.856
I worry sometimes that the louder we get,

40:00.940 --> 40:03.859
the harder it is for someone
to even find their voice.

40:05.152 --> 40:10.074
To tell their story. And that's the
first thing that needs to happen, right?

40:11.283 --> 40:14.620
People need to be able to speak
before they can shout.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.249
Okay.

40:20.459 --> 40:21.459
What are you getting at?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.255
I need your help.

40:25.714 --> 40:26.714
All of you.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.385
<i>All right,
who's the keeper of the banner?</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:34.598
- Got it.
- Great.

40:35.015 --> 40:36.058
And the paint?

40:36.142 --> 40:36.976
Right here.

40:37.059 --> 40:39.937
Okay, great. Just make sure you hide it
when we go outside, okay?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.397
And the megaphone?

40:41.897 --> 40:43.149
No idea. Can't find it.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.532
This is gonna be the biggest
fucking wake-up call Liberty's ever seen.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.952
Right, phase one, let's go!

40:55.035 --> 40:56.036
Yeah!

41:05.671 --> 41:07.631
Hey, can you pass the black marker?

41:08.716 --> 41:11.635
Um, I forgot my towel's in my car.
I'll be right back, okay?

41:13.137 --> 41:16.015
No, I need a black one.
Does anybody have a black sharpie?

41:17.057 --> 41:20.227
This way, gentlemen. Field house
and visitor lockers this way.

41:29.403 --> 41:30.779
How fucking dare you?

41:34.575 --> 41:37.369
- I wanna give you something.
- I don't want anything from you.

41:37.912 --> 41:38.746
I'm leaving.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.040
Wait, it's not what you think.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.041
What do I think?

41:43.667 --> 41:47.087
I just wanna give you something.

41:47.671 --> 41:50.132
- Then give it to me.
- Well, I wanna explain what it is.

41:50.716 --> 41:53.802
- Like, where it comes from.
- Some time today, Mr. Walker.

41:53.886 --> 41:54.886
Um...

41:55.012 --> 41:58.140
Could you maybe meet me
outside the field house in ten minutes?

41:58.307 --> 41:59.850
Where the whole school can see us?

42:00.434 --> 42:02.937
You know, I shouldn't even be talking
to you here.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.063
Okay, um...

42:05.940 --> 42:06.940
What if...

42:07.441 --> 42:10.361
maybe after the game,
we could meet at the Navy Pier?

42:11.153 --> 42:12.947
Where we all used to drink back when.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.908
You want me to meet you
in the middle of the night, alone?

42:15.991 --> 42:18.202
Out on Navy Pier
in the middle of the river?

42:18.285 --> 42:19.286
Yeah, I hear that.

42:19.954 --> 42:20.954
Um...

42:21.872 --> 42:24.542
Listen, come, don't come.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.212
Bring someone with you
if it makes you feel safer. I just...

42:28.295 --> 42:30.214
I'd really like to give you something.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.635
Either way, Navy Pier,
that's where I'll be.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.012
I hope to see you there.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.901
What's up?

42:50.985 --> 42:52.278
Yo. What's up, man?

42:52.361 --> 42:54.863
- Hey. Y'all go crush it.
- Hey, Bryce. What's up?

43:02.079 --> 43:04.707
Hey, guys.
I need to talk to Monty for a minute.

43:05.916 --> 43:06.917
Everything okay?

43:07.459 --> 43:08.899
No, so you should probably take off.

43:08.961 --> 43:10.212
No, he can stay.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.756
What you have to say to me,
you can say in front of him.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.174
All right.

43:16.677 --> 43:20.389
I'm here to talk to you about Tyler,
and how you raped him in the bathroom.

43:21.974 --> 43:22.974
He told you that?

43:24.393 --> 43:26.061
I didn't rape him, that's fucking insane.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.147
You didn't violate him
with a broom handle?

43:29.898 --> 43:31.483
Yeah, dude. That was a joke.

43:31.900 --> 43:35.112
You shoved a broom into his asshole
and made him bleed.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.447
Explain the joke.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.407
Okay, it was like hazing or whatever.

43:38.490 --> 43:39.950
That's not hazing, that's rape.

43:40.034 --> 43:43.120
What, you're gonna teach me
about what rape is?

43:43.621 --> 43:46.081
Like what you did to a dozen girls
at this school?

43:47.291 --> 43:49.293
No, I'm not gonna teach you anything.

43:49.752 --> 43:50.912
I'm just gonna tell you this.

43:50.961 --> 43:52.963
You're gonna stay the fuck away
from Tyler.

43:53.047 --> 43:56.467
You're not gonna touch him.
You're not gonna look at him. Anything.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.636
You have a class with him, transfer.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.055
Pass him in the halls,
take a different hall.

44:01.138 --> 44:02.473
I'll check in with him every week

44:02.556 --> 44:05.267
to see how he's doing.
If I hear one fucking thing about you,

44:05.351 --> 44:08.103
if I hear that you even looked
in his direction,

44:08.187 --> 44:11.231
then the cops find out
about Tony's car...

44:12.524 --> 44:14.693
about the gun you gave Alex...

44:16.070 --> 44:18.197
about the time you tried to kill Clay...

44:19.281 --> 44:20.282
They get everything.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.702
What the fuck, man? We're brothers.

44:24.536 --> 44:25.536
Why are you doing this?

44:27.456 --> 44:28.540
Have a good game...

44:29.416 --> 44:30.416
brother.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.432
<i>By half time, there had been plenty
of hard hits on the field,</i>

44:46.183 --> 44:48.811
<i>but nothing compared
to what Jessica was about to do.</i>

44:49.687 --> 44:52.231
<i>It was going to change everything.
For everybody.</i>

44:54.566 --> 44:56.568
<i>And that concludes our halftime show,</i>

44:56.860 --> 44:58.100
<i>taking us into the second half!</i>

44:58.153 --> 44:59.947
<i>Liberty leads, 14-10.</i>

45:07.121 --> 45:08.121

45:29.309 --> 45:31.061
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.604

45:32.688 --> 45:34.064

45:44.700 --> 45:46.452

45:46.535 --> 45:47.953

46:42.591 --> 46:43.717
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.220
Ani, you gotta get off the field.
It's about to get real bad.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.303
What?

46:47.596 --> 46:49.389
Rape culture has got to go!

46:49.473 --> 46:50.808
- Hey, hey. Ho, ho.
- Shit!

46:50.891 --> 46:54.228
- Jess. They've got police.
- So what? We're not trespassing.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.437
But we're gonna get hurt.

46:55.521 --> 46:57.582
People have already been hurt.
Ask your friend Bryce!

46:57.606 --> 46:58.649
Go on, go!

46:59.525 --> 47:01.151
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

47:03.904 --> 47:04.904
Stop!

47:05.906 --> 47:07.546
Just get off the field! Let's go.

47:07.574 --> 47:08.574
Ho, ho.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.203
- Rape culture has got to go.
- Hey, nice ass!

47:11.286 --> 47:12.579
- Nice tits!
- Fuck you!

47:13.622 --> 47:15.666
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

47:15.874 --> 47:16.874
What the...

47:17.626 --> 47:18.544
What the fuck?

47:18.627 --> 47:19.627
What the...

47:36.520 --> 47:37.563
Hey, stop!

47:40.023 --> 47:42.025
Is this what it takes for you to see us?

47:42.109 --> 47:45.404
Then get a good fucking look,
'cause we're not going anywhere!

47:45.863 --> 47:47.698
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

47:48.323 --> 47:49.783
Rape culture has got to go!

47:49.867 --> 47:51.827
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

47:51.910 --> 47:53.745
Rape culture has got to go!

47:53.829 --> 47:55.664
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

47:55.747 --> 47:57.416
Rape culture has got to go!

48:02.379 --> 48:03.379
Hey.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.258
We made a statement tonight.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.676
I don't know.

48:09.136 --> 48:11.680
Okay, everyone, listen up.
Game's over.

48:11.763 --> 48:14.975
You're all free to leave
once a legal guardian comes to claim you.

48:15.058 --> 48:16.268
Sign outs are with me.

48:16.476 --> 48:19.813
If you engage in any further fighting,
you will be arrested.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.024
Wow.

48:26.361 --> 48:28.238
- That would be my mom. I gotta go.
- Okay.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.865
- Bye. I'll see you.
- Mm-hmm.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.533
- Be safe.
- You, too.

48:32.826 --> 48:34.536
- Bye, y'all.
- Bye.

48:42.961 --> 48:44.171
Come on, Justin.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.007
<i>Before that fight was over,</i>

48:47.090 --> 48:49.843
<i>at least three different fates
would be set in motion.</i>

48:50.761 --> 48:52.471
<i>I'll get to the rest in a minute.</i>

48:52.846 --> 48:54.389
<i>But first, Jessica.</i>

48:55.474 --> 48:58.977
You told me that, after the game,
you went off with Justin.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.022
Now Clay says
that you said you were home alone.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.149
I went home and went to bed.

49:04.483 --> 49:06.234
Ask my dad, he tucked me in.

49:06.318 --> 49:07.778
So, why did you lie earlier?

49:07.861 --> 49:09.947
Because I wanted to protect my boyfriend.

49:10.989 --> 49:12.199
No way Justin did it,

49:12.282 --> 49:14.660
and he didn't have anyone
to cover for him, so I did.

49:15.243 --> 49:16.828
And because it's none of your business.

49:16.912 --> 49:17.913
It is, though.

49:17.996 --> 49:20.540
Because Clay is my friend
and he's in real trouble.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.125
Clay is my friend, too.

49:22.542 --> 49:25.045
- And maybe we're all in real trouble.
- Why'd you say that?

49:26.922 --> 49:27.965
Where were you that night?

49:28.423 --> 49:30.801
Also at home in bed,
though no one tucked me in.

49:34.262 --> 49:36.098
- Have you ever been in court?
- No.

49:37.432 --> 49:39.267
Someone's gonna go down for this.

49:40.644 --> 49:43.021
And odds are good
they'll take all of us along.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.736
<i>So, you and Jessica
both had an alibi?</i>

49:50.445 --> 49:51.445
Apparently.

49:52.906 --> 49:54.032
And Clay didn't.

49:57.452 --> 50:00.831
<i>The truth was,
no one's alibi seemed super solid.</i>

50:08.171 --> 50:10.298
You got balls,
asking for a meet-up.

50:11.258 --> 50:12.592
What the fuck do you want?

50:15.345 --> 50:16.471
I want to make a deal.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.017
I sell for you,

50:20.350 --> 50:21.601
for as long as you want.

50:22.978 --> 50:24.021
And in return, I...
