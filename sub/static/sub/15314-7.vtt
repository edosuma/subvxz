KNOCKING

00:05.141 --> 00:06.551
KNOCKING CONTINUES

00:06.541 --> 00:08.202
Come on...

00:12.021 --> 00:14.182
How much longer...?
I'm almost through.

FOOTSTEPS

00:18.581 --> 00:21.425
(Shh. Someone's coming. Guards.)

00:26.421 --> 00:30.744
The castle's waking up. Time to go.
Now! We have to get the Pact
from the strongroom.

00:30.741 --> 00:32.549
England's future depends on it.

00:32.540 --> 00:36.170
Robin! No time! Will...

00:38.221 --> 00:39.950
And quietly.

00:46.821 --> 00:48.470
There you go.

00:51.501 --> 00:54.709
It's empty. Where's the Pact?!
Where's everything?

00:54.701 --> 00:57.784
I don't know, but I do know
it's a good job nobody's heard us.

00:57.781 --> 00:59.430
Last time there were dogs!

00:59.421 --> 01:01.150
DOGS BARK AND SNARL

01:04.221 --> 01:06.143
Run?!!

01:58.961 --> 02:01.862
Are you not eating?

02:01.861 --> 02:03.431
No.

02:04.761 --> 02:07.946
John, we have to go back
and get that Pact.

02:07.941 --> 02:09.146
It's proof of treason.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.803
We show that to the King
and the Sheriff's history.

02:11.801 --> 02:13.792
Robin,
we've no idea where it's hidden!

02:19.441 --> 02:21.102
The alarm!

02:28.241 --> 02:29.708
HORSE WHINNIES

02:34.321 --> 02:36.266

02:39.221 --> 02:41.644
Who said money
doesn't grow on trees?

02:44.981 --> 02:47.745
THE MEN CLAMOUR

02:47.741 --> 02:49.868
I've no more than ten shillings!

02:49.861 --> 02:52.944
Oh, here we go... Then why resist?

02:52.941 --> 02:55.546
Tell the truth and we'll only
take a tenth. Lie...

02:55.541 --> 02:58.192
...and we take it all.
It's the truth. Then show us!

02:59.921 --> 03:04.051
I need every penny for the woman I
love. You're going to buy a woman?

03:04.041 --> 03:05.429
To marry her!

03:06.841 --> 03:09.389
Her father
borrowed money from Canon Birkley.

03:09.381 --> 03:13.442
Yeah, we know Birkley. Where Birkley
goes, the Sheriff's not far behind.

03:13.441 --> 03:16.126
Her father signed a bond of debt.

03:16.121 --> 03:17.725
And now he can't pay?

03:17.721 --> 03:19.268
Not easily, no. He's dead.

03:20.801 --> 03:25.306
Oh, please, we're not
going to believe this?!

03:25.301 --> 03:27.804
The bond
is locked away in the castle.

03:27.801 --> 03:31.965
And Beatrice will be in
service to the Canon until
her father's debts are paid.

03:31.961 --> 03:35.169
That's why I need every shilling.
How much is the debt?

03:35.161 --> 03:37.766
Two thousand pounds.

03:37.761 --> 03:39.843
Ten shillings
won't get you very far.

03:39.841 --> 03:43.811
I pay what I can! I'll keep paying,
until Beatrice is free.

03:43.801 --> 03:46.042
This gets better and better.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.407
C'mere, you, get back...

03:49.001 --> 03:50.889
If your story is true, my friend...

03:50.881 --> 03:55.489
It is true! Of course it isn't true!
If your story is true...

03:55.481 --> 03:59.770
If you really do have only
ten shillings, then we...

03:59.761 --> 04:01.831
will pay off your debt.

04:01.821 --> 04:04.927
What?! What? What happens if it IS
true? It isn't!

04:09.281 --> 04:10.805
You see?

04:10.801 --> 04:13.804
I told you. Ten shillings.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.185
What are you doing?
It's all our money!

04:21.180 --> 04:24.389
We're robbing from the rich
to give to the... rich. Right.

04:24.381 --> 04:26.747
It's to help him marry
his sweetheart, Will.

04:26.741 --> 04:28.629
Think of it as a wedding present.

04:28.621 --> 04:31.488
What? How about a toasting fork,
like everyone else?

04:31.481 --> 04:34.621
We'll be broke. Go and fill
the bottom of a chest with sand.

04:34.621 --> 04:38.648
We follow that money,
we find the Pact.

04:39.501 --> 04:42.447
Look, trust me! I have a plan.

04:47.421 --> 04:51.243
Robin's favourite. Leads from outside
straight into the castle.

04:51.241 --> 04:53.892
A simple iron grill in there
would fix that.

04:55.441 --> 04:59.525
Mmmm... Bars on there.

04:59.521 --> 05:01.887
Upgrade this young man to leather.

05:01.881 --> 05:05.362
He's a hero.
HE CHUCKLES

05:05.361 --> 05:07.682
An idea as good
as emptying the strongroom.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.805
What're you doing?
I'm doing nothing.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.689
Giving away
all Robin's secrets!

05:14.681 --> 05:17.707
You advised the Sheriff
about the strongroom.

05:17.701 --> 05:20.932
Look, I'm fighting for my life
here, Marian. Yes, you are.

05:20.921 --> 05:25.927
Stop now,
or I swear I will kill you.

05:30.041 --> 05:34.045
Something wrong?
No. No. Just... meeting the locals.

05:35.481 --> 05:36.766
In.

05:39.581 --> 05:41.845
John of York, my dear son!

05:41.841 --> 05:45.288
How wonderful to see you. How
much are you paying me this week?

05:45.281 --> 05:46.327
The lot.

05:47.661 --> 05:50.664
My porters have the money
to pay the bond.

05:50.661 --> 05:53.346
I'm here to claim my bride.

05:53.341 --> 05:56.868
Oh, g-good!
The Sheriff will be... delighted.

05:56.861 --> 05:59.785
Have your men give it to the guards.

05:59.781 --> 06:03.308
You wait through there and I'll
give the Sheriff the good news.

06:10.201 --> 06:13.921
I hope you know what
you're doing, Robin. Trust me, John.

06:33.481 --> 06:34.641
My Lord.

06:34.641 --> 06:35.710
What?

06:35.701 --> 06:37.248
We have a problem.

06:37.241 --> 06:38.321
Please.

06:40.961 --> 06:43.646
I'm not being funny,
but it doesn't look like a problem.

06:43.641 --> 06:45.529
It's the repayment of a loan.

06:47.081 --> 06:51.643
What's the problem?
It's the bond on the girl, Beatrice.
York is waiting outside. York?

06:51.641 --> 06:53.211
It's too late.

06:53.201 --> 06:54.930
We've agreed to sell her to Durham.

06:54.921 --> 06:58.129
Anyway... You said he had nothing.
Where did he get this money?

06:58.121 --> 07:01.409
My Lord, I couldn't say,
but it's all there, everything.

07:01.401 --> 07:07.124
What do I tell him? You use your
initiative, hmm? Tell him it was
an act of God.

07:18.381 --> 07:20.383
John! Beatrice!

07:22.181 --> 07:23.603
What are you doing here?

07:23.601 --> 07:27.241
I'm here to save you. I've paid off
the bond, and we're to be together.

07:27.241 --> 07:28.788
Come round!

07:32.881 --> 07:35.861
Take her.
What are they doing? What's going on?

07:35.861 --> 07:37.726
You leave her alone! John!

07:37.721 --> 07:40.201
Beatrice!
The money. It's not all there.

07:40.201 --> 07:42.726
It is there! Every penny.
Capital and interest.

07:42.721 --> 07:44.609
Not the early redemption charges.

07:44.601 --> 07:47.490
The early... what?
It's another five hundred.

07:47.481 --> 07:49.483
Five hundred?

07:49.481 --> 07:54.692
I'll marry her without the bond. Do
you not understand how debt works?

07:54.681 --> 07:57.969
While I have the bond,
she is church property.

08:04.641 --> 08:07.610
I know where he got this from.

08:07.601 --> 08:11.082
These boxes belong to Robin. How
do you know? Well, cos I nicked...

08:11.081 --> 08:14.801
Cos I know. Why would Robin Hood
give money to a knight?

08:14.801 --> 08:19.261
Well, he wouldn't. Unless... he
thought he could get it back.

08:20.941 --> 08:25.241
Well... Let's disappoint him,
shall we?

08:26.061 --> 08:28.586
We're going to put it
in your little birdcage.

08:28.581 --> 08:30.651
It's time for the unveiling.

08:31.621 --> 08:33.907
My Lord, this cage. Is it wise?

08:33.900 --> 08:35.823
It's your man's idea. It's genius.

08:35.821 --> 08:37.846
All that money where everyone can
see it?

08:37.900 --> 08:40.028
And Robin Hood's going to steal it.

08:57.581 --> 08:59.344
(Where are they going?

08:59.341 --> 09:01.343
(Instead of left, they've gone right!

09:01.341 --> 09:03.184
(Right leads back outside!)

09:03.181 --> 09:04.546
Robin...

09:05.701 --> 09:07.623
BUZZ OF CONVERSATION

09:10.581 --> 09:13.106
This is not good. It should lead
us to the Pact.

09:13.101 --> 09:14.625
We're back where we started!

09:14.621 --> 09:16.623
Shhh!

09:16.621 --> 09:18.145
And what's that?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.381
FANFARE

09:23.181 --> 09:28.141
People... My dear people,

09:28.141 --> 09:30.746
we are gathered here today

09:30.741 --> 09:34.871
to witness the unveiling
of my marvellous birdcage.

09:34.861 --> 09:36.283
CROWD GASPS

09:36.281 --> 09:38.681
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

09:38.681 --> 09:41.343
What're you doing?
We're trying to find the Pact.

09:41.341 --> 09:44.287
Nottingham's exchequer,

09:44.281 --> 09:47.307
our community chest.

09:47.301 --> 09:55.310
There for all to see,
demonstrating once again my
commitment to open government, hmm?

09:55.301 --> 09:57.690
CROWD MURMURS

09:57.681 --> 10:03.449
And this,
this latest addition to our fund,

10:03.441 --> 10:10.722
I have been reliably informed,
has come from the coffers
of Robin Hood himself.

10:10.721 --> 10:16.512
CROWD GASPS
There goes our money. Archers all
around. Clever.

10:16.501 --> 10:21.643
If you happen to see Robin Hood
and he asks you,
"Have you seen my money?",

10:21.641 --> 10:27.967
you can say to him, "The answer my
friend, is blowing in the wind!"
PEOPLE LAUGH

10:27.961 --> 10:30.088
It was Allan's idea.

10:30.081 --> 10:35.405
He's informed the Sheriff of all
the ways in and out of the castle.

10:35.401 --> 10:38.541
A good scheme, Allan.
They're sealing off the exits.

10:38.541 --> 10:40.145
You have to get out now.

10:40.141 --> 10:44.384
But what if Allan tells him about
you? He won't. I've silenced him.

10:47.541 --> 10:49.987
STOP!
CROWD: Oh!

10:51.321 --> 10:54.085
That's my money! What's that man
doing?

10:54.081 --> 10:56.447
I want my bride! Is he mad?

10:56.441 --> 11:00.844
Yes, he's in love. I've settled
her debts and you've got your money.

11:02.441 --> 11:05.547
You're the thieves,
you and the Canon.

11:05.541 --> 11:10.444
WOMAN SCREAMS
Not Robin Hood.
CROWD LAUGHS

11:10.441 --> 11:12.363
Guards! Hang him.

11:12.361 --> 11:13.965
What?

11:18.441 --> 11:20.409
Come on, John.

11:20.401 --> 11:25.031
Much, grab a corner! John!

11:26.841 --> 11:28.365
Jump!

11:30.961 --> 11:32.428
John!

11:35.161 --> 11:38.608
Now! Ohh! Uhh!
PEOPLE SCREAM

11:40.501 --> 11:42.321
NOW! Come on!

11:42.321 --> 11:44.004
Run! Move!

11:45.241 --> 11:46.242
John!

11:47.401 --> 11:48.470
John?

11:48.461 --> 11:49.962
Come on!

12:04.721 --> 12:06.211
We've lost all our money.

12:06.201 --> 12:08.021
And we don't have the Pact.

12:08.021 --> 12:10.649
What were you playing at?
We could've been killed!

12:10.641 --> 12:12.609
Did you tell him it was our money?
No!

12:12.601 --> 12:14.410
The Canon said it wasn't enough.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.881
He says I have
to pay early redemption charges.

12:18.721 --> 12:22.145
You know what? We need to have
a little chat with this Canon.

12:22.141 --> 12:25.850
I hear he takes confession from
the tavern girls every lunchtime.

12:30.461 --> 12:33.112
They got away. Surprise, mm? Not.

12:33.101 --> 12:37.231
Hood always gets away, and I'm
getting rather TIRED OF IT!

12:38.381 --> 12:40.952
This time...

12:40.941 --> 12:42.704
WE go to HIM.

12:44.841 --> 12:48.129
Look, like I said to Giz, I...

12:48.121 --> 12:50.362
I can't tell you where Robin lives.

12:53.921 --> 12:56.469
Whose side are you on, Allan?

12:58.041 --> 13:01.727
Even if I did tell you, he might've
moved on. We'll find out, won't we?

13:01.721 --> 13:03.370
I want him dead.

13:05.321 --> 13:09.212
Yeah, but if he hasn't moved on,
he'll set traps up.
It'd be too dangerous.

13:09.201 --> 13:11.123
Yes, well...

13:11.121 --> 13:14.204
Don't you worry about that, eh,
dear boy?

13:15.121 --> 13:16.691
We'll send you in first.

13:34.741 --> 13:37.244
(Marian... Father...
Shh-shh!

13:38.541 --> 13:41.647
(Father, Robin is in trouble.

13:41.641 --> 13:43.802
(Allan is leading Gisborne
to the camp.

13:43.801 --> 13:48.704
(I need to find a way to get out
of the castle and warn him, but
the Sheriff has blocked every exit.

13:48.701 --> 13:53.183
(I don't know what to do.) Do you
want to end up in a cell like me?

13:53.181 --> 13:58.721
No, but I must warn Robin.
Is he worthy of all these
risks you take for him? Yes!

13:58.721 --> 14:00.461
He can't change anything.

14:00.461 --> 14:02.190
Yes, he can.

14:02.181 --> 14:05.765
He's going to show the traitors'
Pact to the King.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.150
The Sheriff's days are numbered.

14:08.141 --> 14:09.904
And does Robin know where it is?

14:09.901 --> 14:12.051
This Pact? No.

14:13.701 --> 14:15.749
But he'll find it.

14:15.741 --> 14:17.823
The pair of you...

14:17.821 --> 14:22.861
You're dreamers. Dreamers?! Because
we are not weak like you?

14:22.861 --> 14:25.512
How dare you? You caused all this!

14:25.501 --> 14:30.188
You allowed the Sheriff to take
your job. You stood there and did
nothing. That is not true.

14:30.181 --> 14:31.512
And you condemn Robin...

14:33.141 --> 14:35.792
You should be helping us.

14:35.781 --> 14:37.829
I don't have time for this.

14:37.821 --> 14:39.527
Marian...

14:40.541 --> 14:42.509
I'm ashamed of you sometimes.

14:51.221 --> 14:52.324
Marian...

14:54.901 --> 14:57.301
DOOR CLANGS SHUT

14:57.301 --> 14:59.963
FOOTSTEPS ECHO

15:06.341 --> 15:08.104
MUTED CONVERSATION

15:14.421 --> 15:16.423
COIN JINGLES

15:18.061 --> 15:19.221
What do you want?

15:19.221 --> 15:21.269
I'm here to take confession.
Very good.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.383
Yours!

15:25.381 --> 15:28.669
I've paid off Beatrice's bond.
Where is it?

15:28.661 --> 15:31.630
I don't have it. Is it in
the birdcage? It's not, is it?

15:31.621 --> 15:35.182
It's too exposed up there for
papers. Well, how would I know?

15:35.181 --> 15:39.902
You don't understand.
You see, it's not just my friend
here who needs to know.

15:39.901 --> 15:45.066
Well, as God is my friend,
I swear I don't know where they are.
And I swear to you,

15:45.061 --> 15:48.064
that if you don't tell us,

15:48.061 --> 15:50.302
God won't be your friend,

15:50.301 --> 15:52.189
he'll be your next-door neighbour.

15:52.181 --> 15:53.227
Whoa! Wh...!

15:54.261 --> 15:58.186
If you promise not to hurt me,
I will tell you the truth.

16:00.261 --> 16:01.831
I promise.

16:01.821 --> 16:06.747
Listen, I have no idea where
the Sheriff keeps his papers,
but it doesn't matter.

16:06.741 --> 16:10.711
Somebody else has already
repaid the bond. What? Who?

16:10.701 --> 16:14.262
The Earl of Durham. He will marry
Beatrice on Saturday.

16:14.261 --> 16:16.149
The Sheriff's made a deal.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.530
She would never marry
another man. She loves me.

16:18.521 --> 16:22.230
That's why we haven't told her.
That is immoral! Oh, grow up!

16:22.221 --> 16:28.171
Money has a way of making things
moral, and Durham is paying more
than you could ever dream of.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.425
After all, she's a very pretty girl.

16:30.421 --> 16:32.207
Uh-uh!

16:32.201 --> 16:35.625
You made a promise before God
not to hurt me.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.509
HE did...

16:42.241 --> 16:43.242
CLATTERING
Aagh!

16:45.021 --> 16:46.170
PEOPLE CRY OUT

16:47.641 --> 16:49.689
...I didn't. Thank you.

16:51.481 --> 16:53.210
Gisborne's men, get on the back!

16:53.201 --> 16:56.364
We're going to Hood's camp!
Come on, get on there... Get up!

16:56.361 --> 16:59.865
Guy, I need a favour.
No. I must get to a physician.

16:59.861 --> 17:02.728
My father is getting worse.
Marian...

17:02.721 --> 17:05.531
You know the rules
governing your house arrest.

17:05.521 --> 17:08.365
But I would be with you and
I would come straight back.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.069
Please...
Piece of gold for the head of Hood!

17:14.161 --> 17:17.210
Get yourselves together.
We've work to do.

17:17.201 --> 17:20.329
Why? The Sheriff is selling Beatrice
to the Earl of Durham.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.060
We have to get her out. How?

17:22.060 --> 17:23.961
Allan's blocked all our ways in.

17:23.961 --> 17:27.624
Oh... Don't worry,
we'll think of something. Come on.

17:32.521 --> 17:34.341
I am truly beholden to you all.

17:35.461 --> 17:36.530
It's what we do.

17:36.521 --> 17:40.571
You have no idea what she
means to me. Let me guess...

17:40.561 --> 17:43.007
You can't sleep for thinking of her.

17:44.121 --> 17:47.010
You can't turn a corner
without hoping she'll be there.

17:47.001 --> 17:50.926
You have those feelings?
I'm just guessing.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.689
Thank you.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.366
Once again I am in your debt.

18:05.361 --> 18:08.728
I'm not comfortable with the
Sheriff's treatment of your father.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.961
Or you.

18:11.921 --> 18:14.082
Do you need me to wait
at the physician's?

18:14.081 --> 18:16.788
No, don't let me keep you.

18:16.781 --> 18:18.362
Go straight back.

18:27.921 --> 18:29.491
HORSE WHINNIES

18:38.421 --> 18:39.524
HORSE WHINNIES

19:07.661 --> 19:08.730
Come on.

19:10.081 --> 19:11.810
ROBIN!

19:11.801 --> 19:13.325
Yes, my love?

19:13.321 --> 19:16.722
Get me down! You're in danger!
But you look so good up there!

19:16.721 --> 19:18.962
You will pay, Robin of Locksley.

19:18.961 --> 19:21.850
Honestly! You look gorgeous
from any angle.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.121
ALL: Ooh!

19:24.121 --> 19:26.487
How do I look from that angle?

19:26.481 --> 19:29.644
Listen to me, I was wrong.
Allan is out of control.

19:29.641 --> 19:33.168
He's leading Gisborne and his men
here, now! Allan?

19:38.361 --> 19:39.862
You should stay here with us.

19:39.861 --> 19:43.365
I cannot live in the forest.
Why not?

19:43.361 --> 19:49.448
Well... Because green doesn't
suit me? It's your father, isn't it?

19:49.441 --> 19:53.923
I cannot turn my back on him.
And I cannot be found here.

19:55.721 --> 19:58.531
What I said before... What?

19:58.521 --> 19:59.681
You know...

20:00.901 --> 20:02.448
I said you were gorgeous.

20:04.881 --> 20:06.644
I meant it.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.184
HORSE SNORTS

20:10.181 --> 20:12.684
And I meant what I said.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.425
One day you will pay,
Robin of Locksley.

20:26.201 --> 20:27.429
HORSE WHINNIES

20:28.441 --> 20:30.102
"Just guessing"?

20:30.101 --> 20:31.682
Liar!

20:34.621 --> 20:36.441
We've closed up the camp.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.865
Let's meet Gisborne and Allan
on the lower road.

20:40.861 --> 20:42.749
Give Allan the welcome he deserves.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.562
This is war. Now come on...

20:57.061 --> 20:58.483
HORSES WHINNY

21:10.538 --> 21:13.382
Well, as the Sheriff said...

21:13.381 --> 21:15.087
you take the lead.

21:17.065 --> 21:18.669
Well, we're not there yet.

21:20.348 --> 21:21.770
All right...

21:22.911 --> 21:24.833
Guards, wait there.

22:01.277 --> 22:02.926
I told you to hang back!

22:08.957 --> 22:10.367
Hood!

22:10.357 --> 22:13.178
I thought you said we weren't near!
We're not!

22:13.177 --> 22:14.678
He knew we were coming.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.703
HORSE NEIGHS

22:20.697 --> 22:22.198
It's Robin!

22:23.637 --> 22:24.638
HE GASPS

22:25.717 --> 22:26.843
GALLOPING HOOVES

22:35.997 --> 22:39.364
Guy! GUY! Get on!

22:44.117 --> 22:45.641
They got away.

22:45.637 --> 22:47.446
Gisborne knows someone warned us.

22:47.437 --> 22:49.507
He'll squeeze Allan
to find out who.

22:49.497 --> 22:52.045
Allan would not betray Marian.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.665
Yes, he would.
Allan is not betraying anyone.

22:54.657 --> 22:57.205
We're going to see to that.

23:06.577 --> 23:08.465
Open up. Injured men 'ere.

23:08.457 --> 23:10.823
Gisborne said you were all dead.

23:10.817 --> 23:13.206
Do we look dead? Open up!

23:18.797 --> 23:19.877
HORSE WHINNIES

23:31.097 --> 23:34.077
Go to the tower,
find the girl, get her out.

23:35.057 --> 23:38.618
And you? I'm going to find Allan.

23:38.617 --> 23:42.940
Robin... Don't...

23:42.937 --> 23:44.017
Djaq...

23:46.297 --> 23:49.937
I know you
liked him, but he HAS to be stopped.

23:49.937 --> 23:51.541
For all our sakes.

23:54.777 --> 23:56.017
Good luck.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.086
Ready?

24:03.057 --> 24:04.501
WHISTLE

24:09.177 --> 24:10.257
Robin!

24:10.257 --> 24:13.579
Expecting to find your
new friend Gisborne, Allan?

24:15.997 --> 24:17.999
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

24:17.997 --> 24:20.500
I had no choice.

24:20.497 --> 24:23.182
I would never take him to the camp.

24:23.177 --> 24:27.102
I wouldn't. I love you, Robin,
all of you. That's very touching.

24:28.937 --> 24:33.226
But as they say... Love hurts.

24:40.817 --> 24:41.943
Don't do it, Robin!

24:57.137 --> 24:59.219
Let's just talk about this. Yeah.

24:59.217 --> 25:03.540
Let's talk. And you can start by
telling me where the Sheriff
keeps his documents.

25:03.537 --> 25:06.404
I don't know! I just told him
to empty his strongroom.

25:06.397 --> 25:09.787
You must know where he's
moved the Pact. I swear I don't.

25:11.497 --> 25:14.477
Maybe his room, there's a safe
in there. Trust me, Robin.

25:14.477 --> 25:16.866
Trust you?! No, I don't think so.

25:21.637 --> 25:23.741
I've told you I'd never betray you!

25:23.737 --> 25:26.661
You already have.
And next you'll betray Marian.

25:29.477 --> 25:32.139
I am not a Judas. And I'm not Jesus.

25:36.837 --> 25:40.421
Marian? What happened to you?

25:42.017 --> 25:44.497
An incident in the woods.
It was nothing.

25:45.257 --> 25:47.043
THEY GROAN

25:54.137 --> 25:58.062
How is Sir Edward? I wasjust on
my way to see him, actually.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.901
I'll tell him you asked after him.
That's kind.

26:03.817 --> 26:04.863
Marian...

26:08.777 --> 26:10.540
There is another side to me... Guy.

26:12.657 --> 26:16.900
My father. I should like
to visit him alone.

26:18.357 --> 26:19.984
Of course.

26:32.977 --> 26:34.183
Now...

26:34.177 --> 26:35.257
Please.

26:36.577 --> 26:38.158
I don't want to die.

26:38.157 --> 26:40.899
Well, that's the only way
you're going to escape me.

26:40.897 --> 26:42.125
Robin, spare him!

26:43.657 --> 26:44.999
I can't.

26:44.997 --> 26:46.919
Please. Do it for me.

26:46.917 --> 26:48.600
Marian, I'm doing this for you.

26:48.597 --> 26:49.803
To protect you.

26:49.797 --> 26:53.881
Robin! Robin, please.
If you love me, you will let him go.

26:53.877 --> 26:55.640
I do love you.

26:55.637 --> 26:57.525
And that's why I can't let him live.

26:57.517 --> 27:01.078
Because one day he'd do something
that would take you away from me.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.125
I wouldn't.

27:03.117 --> 27:06.905
Please,
don't taint us with his blood.

27:21.097 --> 27:25.386
You owe me your life.
Don't you EVER betray me!

27:25.377 --> 27:27.402
I won't.

27:39.357 --> 27:42.599
It took you a long time
to tell me that.

27:42.597 --> 27:45.179
Tell you what?

27:45.177 --> 27:47.179
You know.

27:51.617 --> 27:53.983
I must have been half concussed.

27:55.177 --> 27:58.078
Well, you'll be fully concussed
if you don't watch out.

28:01.097 --> 28:03.065
I think I know where the Pact is.

28:11.297 --> 28:16.018
Yes? We're here to escort the
prisoner to the Earl of Durham.

28:19.217 --> 28:22.027
Come along, my dear.
Your future husband's waiting.

28:32.817 --> 28:33.920
Father?

28:36.257 --> 28:38.179
Father, I've brought you some food.

28:44.697 --> 28:47.097
I'm sorry about what I said.

29:10.237 --> 29:13.138
SNORING

29:36.137 --> 29:38.822
DOOR CREAKS

30:58.877 --> 30:59.946
The Pact.

31:13.317 --> 31:15.547
THEY MOUTH

31:18.397 --> 31:20.865
(I knew it would be here.)
HE MOUTHS

31:26.517 --> 31:27.939
HE SNORTS

31:35.357 --> 31:36.358
My keys...

31:38.477 --> 31:40.547
My keys... GUARDS! GUARDS!

31:41.357 --> 31:43.882
(My keys! My keys were here.)

31:44.437 --> 31:46.064
Why...?

31:54.157 --> 31:55.738
Shhh.

32:07.277 --> 32:11.839
So... what do we have here, huh?

32:11.837 --> 32:15.238
My old friend...

32:15.237 --> 32:16.647
Hoody Two Shoes.

32:17.397 --> 32:19.285
Looking for me, Sheriff? GUARDS!

32:21.357 --> 32:23.200
AFTER HIM!

32:23.197 --> 32:24.744
GET AFTER HIM!

32:33.397 --> 32:34.477
Edward!

32:34.477 --> 32:41.485
Robin! You escaped the dungeons?
I heard England needed saving.
I have the Pact. Come on, come on.

32:41.477 --> 32:43.206
This way.

32:43.197 --> 32:44.721
Hood's in the castle!

32:44.717 --> 32:48.926
Seal all exits!
Check all the corridors for Hood!

32:48.917 --> 32:50.726
Much. Hah!

32:50.717 --> 32:52.287
Well met, my friends.

32:52.277 --> 32:53.938
A new member of the gang.

32:53.937 --> 32:56.679
THEY CHATTER

33:03.397 --> 33:05.638
Yes! The portcullis is open!

33:07.937 --> 33:11.282
All soldiers,
assemble to the main gate!

33:11.277 --> 33:13.120
We're going into emergency lockdown!

33:13.117 --> 33:15.017
Master, what do we do? Keep going.

33:15.017 --> 33:17.963
No-one goes in or out of the castle.
Halt!

33:24.637 --> 33:27.424
Lads, let us through. Nobody leaves.

33:27.417 --> 33:29.783
We're going into lockdown.

33:29.777 --> 33:33.759
We're escorting the
prisoner to the Earl of Durham.

33:43.097 --> 33:44.200
Thank you.

33:44.937 --> 33:48.941
Stop him! Stop him! That's Hood!

33:48.937 --> 33:50.279
Nice try.

33:50.277 --> 33:52.427
Sorry to rain on your parade, Hood.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.385
That's all right!

33:54.377 --> 33:56.322
Every cloud...

34:05.837 --> 34:07.122
...has a silver lining.

34:09.577 --> 34:11.067
Pay day, boys!
SHOUTING

34:11.056 --> 34:12.388
Come on, let's go!

34:12.377 --> 34:16.507
SHOUTING CONTINUES

34:18.817 --> 34:24.426
Split up! You know where to meet.
And ditch those uniforms. Off!

34:28.456 --> 34:29.879
He's getting away!

34:45.697 --> 34:47.801
Is everyone all right?

34:50.177 --> 34:51.280
Good.

34:52.137 --> 34:54.286
And where'd you think you're going?

34:54.277 --> 34:55.505
Birkley.

34:57.617 --> 35:00.643
That girl stays here.
She belongs to the Earl of Durham.

35:00.637 --> 35:02.423
No, she belongs with me.

35:04.617 --> 35:08.587
Hand her over,
or say goodbye to your friend.
Don't listen to him.

35:10.057 --> 35:11.285
Robin! Go!

35:12.817 --> 35:15.706
That's a mistake, old man.
I will KILL you!

35:15.697 --> 35:16.777
Leave it, Birkley!

35:18.017 --> 35:20.281
You're a man of God.
You cannot kill.

35:21.377 --> 35:24.619
And you, Hood, are a man of war
who cannot kill!

35:28.457 --> 35:29.617
Try me.

35:38.057 --> 35:45.463
Edward! NO! Get him down!

35:45.457 --> 35:49.200
Don't remove the knife.
I'll prepare my instruments.

35:49.197 --> 35:51.506
John, get John and Beatrice
to safety, NOW!

35:51.497 --> 35:53.203
This way. GO!

35:53.757 --> 35:59.059
Robin, leave me. I will not, sir.
I will slow you down.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.457
QUIETLY: Go on, go on.

36:08.717 --> 36:13.302
I've never quite understood
my daughter's feelings for you.

36:13.297 --> 36:15.265
Well, I probably don't deserve them.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.624
No, I think maybe you do.

36:22.777 --> 36:26.668
You'd better take this... Pact.

36:26.657 --> 36:30.104
You will NOT give up your life
for mine.

36:30.097 --> 36:32.748
For England.

36:34.237 --> 36:36.057
Robin, listen to me.

36:37.777 --> 36:41.781
For Marian to lose both of us
would kill her. Edward, Edward...

36:41.777 --> 36:43.938
That is not going to happen.

36:43.937 --> 36:49.261
Give her a message from me.
Tell her... Tell her...

36:51.337 --> 36:53.578
...it's good to dream.

36:53.577 --> 36:54.839
I will.

37:16.097 --> 37:17.382
Who's there?

37:33.077 --> 37:34.863
Edward.

37:43.377 --> 37:44.503
GUARDS!

37:59.677 --> 38:03.465
Father... Father?

38:05.557 --> 38:06.922
Father, wake up!

38:06.917 --> 38:10.921
Wake up, please, wake up... please...

38:10.917 --> 38:15.866
Father... Father...

38:15.857 --> 38:17.518
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:17.517 --> 38:20.281
What happened? Tell me
what happened! Tell me!

38:20.277 --> 38:22.427
There were no witnesses, Marian.

38:22.417 --> 38:26.478
The Sheriff
thinks that he was helping Hood
steal an important document. No!

38:26.477 --> 38:28.718
No, he wasn't! No...!

38:28.717 --> 38:30.537
No...

38:35.617 --> 38:36.902
Sorry...

38:37.977 --> 38:44.940
Marian... I'm so sorry!
Father, I'm sorry!

38:46.777 --> 38:51.385
Marian... Will you just...
leave me alone?

39:00.697 --> 39:05.100
Marian, come on...
Don't you touch me! Don't touch me!

39:08.757 --> 39:12.557
Stop. Wait.

39:12.557 --> 39:14.559
Listen to me.

39:14.557 --> 39:17.583
This place may not be safe
for you now. Why?

39:19.437 --> 39:21.007
This is yours, I believe?

39:20.997 --> 39:23.886
Your father's jailer was
killed with it. I don't care!

39:23.877 --> 39:26.766
The Sheriff WILL care.

39:26.757 --> 39:31.399
And when he finds out that it was
your dagger that killed his jailer,

39:31.397 --> 39:32.898
he will hang you.

39:34.597 --> 39:36.918
No...

39:36.917 --> 39:38.487
Let me look after you.

39:40.977 --> 39:42.342
Protect you.

39:44.797 --> 39:47.197
I've always cared about you, Marian.

39:50.477 --> 39:54.800
My feelings for you... I thought
they'd gone away.

39:56.957 --> 40:01.860
But they haven't. They're stronger
than ever.

40:08.877 --> 40:10.344
No! No!

40:11.897 --> 40:15.264
Forgive me. That was inappropriate.

40:16.937 --> 40:18.541
But in time...

40:21.497 --> 40:23.067
DOOR SLAMS

40:31.377 --> 40:33.265
I was with him when he died.

40:36.877 --> 40:38.947
I'm sorry.

40:43.797 --> 40:45.503
Shhh...

40:56.817 --> 41:00.878
It's my fault.
I told him he was weak.

41:00.877 --> 41:02.981
He died a hero's death. Don't...

41:02.977 --> 41:05.980
He got the Pact.

41:05.977 --> 41:10.459
For England. He died believing
he had a wilful daughter. No.

41:13.097 --> 41:16.362
He asked me to give you a message...

41:16.357 --> 41:19.383
"It's good to dream."

41:28.677 --> 41:30.338
Come with me to the forest.

41:33.337 --> 41:34.827
I have a horse waiting.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.100
Come on.

42:19.957 --> 42:22.562
Do you, John of York,

42:22.557 --> 42:26.846
promise to protect and honour
this woman as long as you
both shall live? I do.

42:26.837 --> 42:31.683
Then I,
as the rightful Lord of Locksley
in the county of Nottingham,

42:31.677 --> 42:35.238
now pronounce you man and wife.

42:35.237 --> 42:37.808
You may kiss the bride.

42:37.797 --> 42:40.163
CHEERS

42:51.437 --> 42:52.961
Thank you.

42:55.637 --> 42:59.186
Toasting fork. Thank you!

43:06.317 --> 43:08.478
Good luck!

43:08.477 --> 43:11.526
You did disarm the trap,
didn't you, Will...?

43:18.777 --> 43:20.404
You know what you're going to do?

43:20.397 --> 43:23.639
Retrieve the Great Pact of
Nottingham... and kill Robin Hood.

43:25.617 --> 43:28.165
Gisborne wants me to find you.
Why would YOU help ME?

43:28.157 --> 43:29.397
Look, I'm not all bad.

43:29.397 --> 43:34.221
I don't NEED to be mollycoddled.
Good. Because you're not
going to get it here.

43:34.217 --> 43:36.560
She's not coming back, Guy. Move on.

43:39.417 --> 43:40.543
What's happening here?

43:40.537 --> 43:43.358
Robin Hood... is dead.
