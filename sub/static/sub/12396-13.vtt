- IT'S VERY COMMON TO SPOT
A DARK-EYED JUNCO.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.704
BUT LET'S KEEP OUR EYES PEELED
FOR A RUDDY TURNSTONE

00:17.750 --> 00:20.173
OR MAYBE A WANDERING TATI'LER.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.041

00:23.090 --> 00:26.082
- THERE'S A LOVELY MATURE
HOODED ORIOLE

00:26.120 --> 00:27.519
IN THE FAR TREE.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.793

- I'M SORRY. SORRY.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.538
DAMN IT, SHAWN.

00:39.570 --> 00:40.764
MY SON JUST BOUGHT ME
THIS NEW PHONE.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.507
I'M NOT SURE HOW
TO TURN IT OFF.

I SAW THAT BRACELET
JUST SITI'ING THERE,

02:16.430 --> 02:17.863
AND I KNEW--
OH, I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.936
THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF
MY NECK--THEY STOOD RIGHT UP.

02:19.970 --> 02:22.165
HEY, BOBBY,
LOOK WHO'S BACK.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.507
WHO'S WORKING
THE EVIDENCE CAGE?

02:23.540 --> 02:25.804
IS LOU IN THERE? LOU'S--
NO, HE DIED, RIGHT?

02:25.840 --> 02:27.933
- NOT A LOT OF HAIR LEFI'
TO JOIN IN THAT CELEBRATION.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.175
- YOUR DAD DOES REALIZE THAT
HE'S RETIRED, RIGHT?

02:30.210 --> 02:31.939
- YEAH, BUT HE HAD A TOUGH YEAR.
I MEAN, COME ON.

02:31.980 --> 02:34.847
HE GOT SHOT AND--
THAT'S REALLY IT, I GUESS.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.438
IF HE WANTS TO RELIVE
THE OLD DAYS

02:36.490 --> 02:37.912
WHEN HE WAS A STARTER
IN THIS LEAGUE,

02:37.950 --> 02:39.918
I SAY WE INDULGE HIM.
- NOW LISTEN.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.484
THIS WAS NOT A WOMAN

02:41.520 --> 02:42.782

INTO THE WOODS AND DIED.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.354
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:44.390 --> 02:47.188
THIS WAS A DELIBERATE
AND HEINOUS ACT OF MALICE.

02:47.230 --> 02:50.791
WHAT WE MUST ASCERTAIN ARE
THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND SHAWN?

02:50.830 --> 02:52.695
- WHY.
- PRONTO. THAT'S RIGHT.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.696
GUSTER, NO HALF-ASSING HERE.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.833

I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD THEORY

02:56.870 --> 02:58.508
AS TO WHO'S INVOLVED.

02:58.540 --> 02:59.871
- GOOD GAME, POP.
- I THINK--

02:59.910 --> 03:01.775
- GOOD GAME.

03:01.810 --> 03:03.243
WE INDULGED HIM ENOUGH.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.239
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.419
- YOU REALIZE YOUR DAD WORKED
HERE UP TO LAST YEAR.

03:09.450 --> 03:10.542
- HE DID?

03:10.590 --> 03:14.549
- WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS A...

03:14.590 --> 03:16.956
WOMAN.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.857
I AM GUESSING BY THIS WOUND

03:19.900 --> 03:21.925
THAT SHE DIED
OF BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA

03:21.960 --> 03:23.359
TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.369
I WOULD PLACE HER AT ABOUT
27 YEARS OF AGE.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.834
- I'M GONNA SAY MORE LIKE 47,
WOODY.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.531

IN HER BIRTHDAY SUIT,
AND THIS AIN'T IT.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.709
- I SAID 47.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.547
- SHE'S ACTUALLY 48 YEARS OLD.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.013
- OH! SEE?
SO WE WERE BOTH WRONG.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.416
- SHELLEY AARONSON,
WIDOWED, WEALTHY,

03:42.450 --> 03:43.542

03:47.990 --> 03:49.753

03:49.790 --> 03:51.826
- WELL, THE RECORDS MATCH
HER FINGERPRINT.

03:51.860 --> 03:56.797
- HOW IS IT THE SAME PERSON?

03:56.830 --> 03:58.695
- THE SAME WAY BRUCE JENNER

ON HER SCALP.

THIS IS WELL DONE.

THIS IS DR. JOAN DIAMOND'S WORK.
I'D KNOW IT ANWVHERE.

I SAW HER SPEAKING AT
A SYMPOSIUM OF FORENSIC ARTISTS.

SHE ALSO APPEARED
ON THE LOVE BOAT

A DALLAS COWBOYS CHEERLEADER.

- BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY
WHAT KILLED HER.

QUITE A BIT OF IT.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.079
NOW WHY IS IT IN HER BLOOD?

04:42.110 --> 04:43.668
- THAT'S A HELL OF A QUESTION,
WOODY.

04:43.710 --> 04:51.947
MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK
DR. JOAN DIAMOND.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.550
- THE DOCTOR IS READY
TO SEE YOU.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.353
- OH, GOOD.

04:56.390 --> 04:59.826
PERHAPS SHE CAN MAKE ME LOOK
BOTH YOUTHFUL AND ASTONISHED.

ALL THE MYSTERY HERE?

08:33.710 --> 08:36.008
- HENRY, YOU STILL LOOK GREAT.
- DON'T--DON'T LIE TO HIM.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.849
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:37.880 --> 08:39.745
- I WASN'T SURE IF YOU CAUGHT
THE PLASTIC SURGERY ANGLE.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.010
I WANTED TO GATHER
SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU.

08:42.050 --> 08:43.711
- WE'RE, LIKE,
SEVEN LAPS AHEAD OF YOU.

- [laughs]
- HENRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.154
AM I BEING ACCUSED
OF SOMETHING?

08:47.190 --> 08:48.851
- NO.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.084
- AU CONTRAIRE.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.121
YOU SEE, DR. DEATH,

08:52.160 --> 08:53.855
SHELLEY WAS SUING YOU.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.664
AND RATHER THAN TAKE A HIT
TO YOUR SPARKLING REPUTATION,

08:56.700 --> 08:59.863
YOU WHACKED HER WITH AN
INDUSTRIAL DOSE OF FACE FREEZER.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.937
SO, END OF SHELLEY,
END OF STORY.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.062
HOW'S THAT FOR AN ACCUSATION?

09:04.110 --> 09:05.930
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.

- SURE, IN MY DREAMS.
ABSOLUTELY.

TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

JUST LIKE BONELESS:
THE CARLA NEWMAN STORY,

09:14.980 --> 09:17.619
THIS MOVIE WRITES ITSELF.
- I'M SORRY.

09:17.650 --> 09:19.345
I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.915
HENRY, IT WAS LOVELY
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.622
- YOU TOO.
- DON'T GO FAR.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.355
ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:26.390 --> 09:27.926
- COME ON, SHAWN,
THAT THEORY OF YOURS

09:27.960 --> 09:29.222
IS A LITTLE HALF-BAKED.
- OF COURSE IT IS.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.898
MOST OF MY THEORIES ARE.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.739
SOME OF THEM AREN'T
EVEN BAKED AT ALL.

09:32.770 --> 09:34.988
SOME OF THEM ARE JUST DOUGH.
SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN DOUGH.

09:35.040 --> 09:35.995
THEY'RE JUST EGGS AND FLOUR.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.962
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BACON.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.331

I ALWAYS CATCH THE BAD GUY.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.940

YOUR HELP DOING IT ANYMORE.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.902
- OH, SO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
NOW, DO YOU?

09:44.950 --> 09:47.077
- NO, JUST EVERYTHING
THAT YOU KNOW AND THEN SOME.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.247

WHERE TO FIND HIM.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.394
- YOU ARE ON FIRE.

10:04.430 --> 10:08.730
YOU ARE ON FIRE RIGHT NOW.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.704
- MR. AND MR. NUSSBAUM,

10:10.740 --> 10:11.900
IT'S TIME TO START
YOUR COUPLES MASSAGE.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.908
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU,
SHAWN.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.100
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME
FOR?

10:15.140 --> 10:16.334
THIS IS YOUR LEAD.
JUST RELAX.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.802
GO WITH IT.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.249
- MY NAME'S BRAD.
THIS IS TRICIA.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.339
JUST RELAX,
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

10:21.380 --> 10:26.659
- HMM.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.214
[whispers]
HE'S, LIKE, HALF SHELLEY'S AGE.

10:28.260 --> 10:38.067
- [whispers]
I BETTER GET THE GIRL!

10:38.100 --> 10:41.228
- WOW, ARE YOU TENSE.

10:41.270 --> 10:42.806
- OH, YEAH.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.936
OH, MY GOSH.
TRICIA, TRICIA, TRICIA.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.847
YOUR FINGERS ARE LIKE
MAGICAL BABY WIENERS.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.178
- SIR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO REMOVE
SOME OF YOUR CLOTHING?

10:52.210 --> 10:53.245
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.043
- MAYBE JUST YOUR SWEATER?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.980
- NEGATORY. MOVE ON.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.942
- OKAY.
- UH, BRAD.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.458
WE'D LIKE TO OFFER OUR
CONDOLENCES FOR SHELLEY.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.822
HELL, IT'S JUST SO AWFUL.

11:03.860 --> 11:05.020
- [clears throat]

11:05.060 --> 11:07.324
DID YOU KNOW SHELLEY?
- YES.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.023
YES, WE MET
AT DR. JOAN DIAMOND'S OFFICE.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.992
CAN I ASK HOW LONG
WERE YOU TWO MARRIED?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.133
- [sniffs]
TWO WEEKS.

11:15.170 --> 11:18.037
- TWO WEEKS?
THAT'S IT?

11:18.070 --> 11:20.971
- THE ONLY TWO WEEKS OF MY LIFE
THAT EVER MATI'ERED.

11:21.010 --> 11:22.329
[clears throat]

11:22.380 --> 11:24.177
TRICIA, COULD YOU PLEASE
GET ME A GLASS OF WATER?

11:24.210 --> 11:25.939
THAN KS.

11:25.980 --> 11:28.346
- TRICIA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THOSE SWEET SAUSAGES?

11:28.380 --> 11:29.984
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS, COPS?

11:30.020 --> 11:31.385
- OWI
[groans] 'NO

11:31.420 --> 11:33.456
NOT COPS.
NOT COPS AT ALL.

11:33.490 --> 11:36.254
- [sighs] OH, FINE.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.258
I'M PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
SHAWN SPENCER.

11:38.290 --> 11:41.327
THIS IS MY BROTHER DARRYL,
AND MY OTHER BROTHER DARRYL.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.090
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHY
SHELLEY WAS SUING DR. DIAMOND?

11:44.130 --> 11:45.927
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:45.970 --> 11:49.838
MY WIFE WAS SO INSECURE.

11:49.870 --> 11:52.509
I KEPT TELLING HER
HER BEAUTY CAME FROM WITHIN.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.132
- FROM WITHIN HER BANK ACCOUNT?

11:54.180 --> 11:55.977
- OW.
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:56.010 --> 11:57.204
THAT I WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF A RICH WIDOW?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.376
- OW.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.173
- I THINK IT'S A LITTLE ODD

12:00.220 --> 12:01.278
THAT YOU'RE WORKING THE DAY
AFTER SHE WAS KILLED.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.049
- OW.
- LOOK, MAN.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.979
I'M JUST TRYING TO COPE, OKAY?
I'M IN PAIN HERE.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.181
- OW, OW.
- SHH.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.051
WE SIGNED A PRENUP, OKAY?

12:10.090 --> 12:12.081
ONE THAT I ASKED FOR.

12:12.130 --> 12:14.394
YOU CAN CALL H_ER LAWYER.
- [groaning]

12:14.430 --> 12:18.526
OW! UGH! AH!

12:18.570 --> 12:21.232
- [sobbing]

12:21.270 --> 12:22.862
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:22.910 --> 12:23.865
DO YOU THINK HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.036
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.436
MY BACK FEELS BETTER THOUGH.
WEIRD.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.436
- WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WEIRD.
- HMM.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.074
- BRAD, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT, MAN.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.419
LOOK, WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE
TO HELP.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.941
SO IF YOU COULD REMEMBER
ANYTHING STRANGE OR UNUSUAL

12:36.990 --> 12:39.959
ABOUT THE DAY THAT SHELLEY DIED,
THAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE

12:39.990 --> 12:41.059
IN FINDING HER KILLER.

12:41.090 --> 12:45.083
- UH, THE DAY SHE PASSED...

12:45.130 --> 12:57.167
SHE MET SOMEONE FOR COFFEE
AT TRUFFLES CAFE.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.030
- ARE YOU FIDDLING
WITH YOUR EARLOBES?

12:59.070 --> 13:01.937
- WHAT? NAH.
- COME ON, SON.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.447
WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.345
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SPOKE
WITH RACHAEL?

13:05.380 --> 13:07.917
- 16 DAYS.
- OH, MY GOSH.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.986
YOUR EARLOBES ARE FINE, OKAY?

13:10.020 --> 13:11.817
IT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP THAT
NEEDS A LIFT.

13:11.850 --> 13:14.978
- I'M ON TILT, SHAWN.
I'M TILTING.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.352
- WHAT'S UP, DOGSTAR?

13:17.390 --> 13:19.529
THIS WOMAN COME
IN HERE RECENTLY?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.994
- SHE MAY HAVE BEEN UPSET,
MAYBE IN AN ARGUMENT.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.258
- YEAH.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.996
SHE WAS WITH SOMEONE WHO LOOKED
JUST LIKE HER.

13:26.030 --> 13:29.431
TWIN SISTER OR CYBORG MADE
IN HER IMAGE.

13:29.470 --> 13:31.506
BOTH ARE POSSIBLE.
- SURE.

13:31.540 --> 13:32.837
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE
ARGUING ABOUT?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.006
- YEAH.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.179
ONE CALLED THE OTHER ONE
A THIEF.

13:36.210 --> 13:38.974
- YOU THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR SECURITY TAPES?

13:39.010 --> 13:45.017
- WE'VE GOT SECURITY TAPES?

13:45.050 --> 13:47.280
- THAT IS DEFINITELY SHELLEY.
- WOW, THEY DO LOOK ALIKE.

13:47.320 --> 13:53.099
- THAT IS ONE HOT ROBOT.

13:53.130 --> 13:56.964
- SHE DOES LOOK FAMILIAR.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.490
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:58.530 --> 14:01.931
THE NOSE OF BRIANNA HICKS.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.335
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

14:03.370 --> 14:06.032
SHELLEY'S A THIEF, GUS--
A NOSE THIEF.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.174
SHE STOLE THE SCHNOZ
OF BRIANNA HICKS

14:08.210 --> 14:11.577
AND BRIANNA HICKS
KILLED HER FOR IT.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.009
DID YOU SWIPE THE HAT
FROM DOGSTAR?

14:13.050 --> 14:15.109
- NAH, I WEAR THIS HAT
ALL THE TIME.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.015
- OH, MY GOSH.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.415
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET DR. JOAN
GET IN YOUR HEAD LIKE THIS.

14:18.450 --> 14:19.917
- LEAVE ME ALONE, SHAWN.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.086
I'M A MAN APART.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.382
MY WHOLE WORLD IS TURNED
UPSIDE DOWN

14:22.420 --> 14:23.956
LIKE A SNOW GLOB.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.218
- LASSIE.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.990
BRIANNA?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:28.030 --> 14:29.258
AND HOW ARE YOU
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.097
- WELL, LET'S SEE.

14:31.130 --> 14:32.222
MAYBE BECAUSE THE PRIVATE
DETECTIVE ON THE CASE

14:32.270 --> 14:33.669
WAS TWO STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.065
- WHAT PRIVATE DETECTIVE?

14:35.100 --> 14:38.968
- THE ONE THAT
DR. DIAMOND HIRED.

14:39.010 --> 14:45.404
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG,
SONNY BOY?

14:47.580 --> 14:49.116
- AM I UPSET?

14:49.150 --> 14:51.038
I'VE SPENT HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

14:51.090 --> 14:53.615
CU LTIVATING THIS LOOK.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.379
AND SHELLEY WAS MATCHING
EVERYTHING I DID.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.355
AND THEN SHE COPIED MY NOSE.

14:59.390 --> 15:01.950
SERIOUSLY.
THAT'S WHERE I DRAW THE LINE.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.319
- HUH.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.928
I GUESS THAT'S WHERE SHE DRAWS
THE LINE.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.062
- I CAN DIG IT.
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.068
JOAN ACTUALLY HIRED YOU.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.204
- YEAH.
WHAT, YOU THINK THAT'S CRAZY?

15:10.240 --> 15:13.232
- NO, NOT IF HER GOAL WAS
TO MAKE A CRAZY DECISION.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.931
- TELL US EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE
LAST TUESDAY

15:15.980 --> 15:18.278
WHEN SHELLEY WAS KILLED.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.175
- I WAS GETTING LIPOSUCTION.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.448
- OKAY.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.381
CAN YOU PROVE IT?

15:24.420 --> 15:27.287
- SURE.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.687
- WHOA.
both: OH!

15:30.730 --> 15:32.049
- THERE'S NO WAY
THAT SHE

15:32.090 --> 15:33.352
DRAGGED SHELLEY'S BODY
INTO THE WOODS.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.550
- AGREED.
YOU WERE WRONG, POP.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.625
- WE WERE BOTH WRONG.
- YOU WERE WRONG FIRST.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.069
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.465
- OH, YEAH? WHAT'S THAT?

15:40.500 --> 15:41.637
- YOU'RE UPSET WITH ME
BECAUSE I SAID

15:41.670 --> 15:43.103
I DON'T NEED YOUR ADVICE
ANYMORE.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.562
AND YOU STILL HAVE A THING
FOR JOAN,

15:44.610 --> 15:47.033
WHO I ADMIT, STILL KEEPS IT
TIGHT AND NICE.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.672
- SHAWN, THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.178
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER.
I WAS HIRED TO DO A JOB.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.747
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
STRICTLY BUSINESS.

15:53.780 --> 15:56.078
- IN THAT CASE, I JUST DON'T
WANT YOU TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.542
- WHAT, EMBARRASS MYSELF?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.182
KID, I WAS DOING THIS
WHILE YOU WERE STILL

15:59.220 --> 16:00.619
POINTING AT THE POTTY SAYING,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.287
"OOH, LOOK AT
WHAT A BIG BOY I AM."

16:02.320 --> 16:04.322
- HE STILL DOES THAT.
- THAT'S JUST FOR ME NOW.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.578
LOOK, DON'T FORGET, POP,
YOU'RE NOT 3O ANYMORE.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.121
OKAY, IN FACT,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN 55.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.424
- ACTUALLY, I AM 55.
- NO KIDDING?

16:11.470 --> 16:14.064
WELL, THEN THIS IS
A SWEET VICTORY FOR YOU, MAN.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.761
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT WHILE
YOU'RE STILL AHEAD?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.007
- BECAUSE I'M GONNA SOLVE
THIS CASE.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.268
- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
DO THAT

16:19.310 --> 16:21.676
WHEN YOU HAVE A PROSTATE
THE SIZE OF A PUMPKIN?

16:21.710 --> 16:23.041
- * I'M MR. BOOTY MAN
- YEAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.604
- * I'M MR. BOOTY MAN

16:24.650 --> 16:29.269
- SHAWN, YOU GOTTA CHANGE
THIS RINGER.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.015
HEY. HI, JOAN.

16:31.050 --> 16:33.587
YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
ON THE PHONE.

16:33.620 --> 16:34.587
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER THERE.

16:34.620 --> 16:40.024
[door closes]

16:40.060 --> 16:41.493
- MURDER?

16:41.530 --> 16:43.327
SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO RUIN ME, HENRY.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.292
- JOAN, WE ARE GONNA FIGURE
THIS THING OUT.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.037
I'M ON THE CASE NOW, BUT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO FOCUS, ALL RIGHT?

16:48.070 --> 16:50.163
DO YOU HAVE ANY ENEMIES
OR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE

16:50.210 --> 16:51.461
JEALOUS OF YOUR SUCCESS?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.432
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START
A LIST.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.107
- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.802
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.239
IT WAS A PRETTY DECENT DATE,
HENRY.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.113
I REALLY THOUGHT
THERE'D BE A SECOND ONE.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.118
I SCARED YOU AWAY,
DIDN'T I?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.050
- NO, I WAS COMING OUT
OF A DIVORCE,

17:07.090 --> 17:11.049
AND I THINK FOCUSING ON BEING
A BETTER DAD TO MY SON

17:11.090 --> 17:13.422
WAS ALL I HAD ROOM FOR.
- WOW.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.496
THEY DON'T MAKE MEN
LIKE YOU ANYMORE.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.327
- I'M STILL GOING TO NEED
THIS LIST.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.339
- THERE IS ONE GUY WHO'S ALWAYS
HAD IT OUT FOR ME.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.237
HERE'S HIS ADDRESS.

17:23.270 --> 17:26.603
IF YOU WANT TO CHECK HIM OUT.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.800
[Henry laughs]

17:27.840 --> 17:29.068
- [whispers]
DOCTOR'S HANDWRITING.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.577
- DAMN IT.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.271
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE A LOOK INTO IT.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.073
I'LL CALL YOU
WITH ANY UPDATES.

17:34.120 --> 17:46.351
- I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.597
- THIS IS KIND OF SAD
FOR US, NO?

17:48.630 --> 17:50.393
WE HAVE NO LEADS OF OUR OWN.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.864
- WHO NEEDS LEADS WHEN WE HAVE
MY FATHER'S LEADS?

17:52.900 --> 17:56.097
OOH.
HE'S TURNING INTO THAT LOT.

17:56.140 --> 18:04.639
LET'S SEE WHAT THE OLD FART HAS
UP HIS SLEEVE.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.275
[engine turns off]

18:08.320 --> 18:10.117
- GREAT.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.141
WE JUST TAILED YOUR DAD
TO HIS AFTERNOON NAP.

18:12.190 --> 18:13.782
- THAT'S KIND OF DEPRESSING,
HUH?

18:13.820 --> 18:15.583
- FOR US OR FOR HIM?

18:15.620 --> 18:17.622
- BOTH, I GUESS.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.458
[both sniffing]

18:20.500 --> 18:22.695
- RELISH?
- MUSTARD.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.597
- SWEET, SWEET MEATY GOODNESS.

18:25.630 --> 18:31.808
both: FOOD TRUCK.

18:31.840 --> 18:41.738
both: MMM, MMM.
- MMM.

18:41.780 --> 18:44.419
WELL PLAYED, POP.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.338
I THINK THE "SUCK IT"
WAS MEANT FOR YOU.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.915
- NO, IT WASN'T, SHAWN.
WE JUST GOT DUSTED BY YOUR DAD.

18:48.960 --> 18:54.296
NOW WHAT DO WE HAVE BESIDES
FOUR JUMBO KUROBUTA PORK DOGS?

18:54.330 --> 18:56.195
- YEAH, HI, JOAN.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.266
- DUDE, I THINK I GOT US
COVERED.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.495
GUS,
WE CAN STILL HAVE IT ALL.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.407
- WHAT?

19:03.440 --> 19:05.829
- [coughs]

19:05.870 --> 19:09.203
EXCUSE ME.
HI, JOAN. IT'S HENRY.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.674
YOU THINK YOU COULD GIVE ME
THAT ADDRESS AGAIN?

19:11.710 --> 19:15.248
GOT IT.
[clears throat]

19:15.280 --> 19:17.840
OH, I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO KEEP MY VOICE DOWN.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.744
I'M IN AN ADULT BOOK STORE.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.417
- GET OFF THE PHONE.
- I GOT IT.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.189
- GET OFF THE PHONE.
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.721
COME ON, LET'S GO.
- I MEAN IT IS WHAT YOU THINK.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.853
I HAVEN'T HAD THE TOUCH
OF A WOMAN

19:27.900 --> 19:34.829
SINCE THE FIRST MAROON 5
ALBUM CAME OUT.

19:34.870 --> 19:39.534
[doorbell rings]

19:39.570 --> 19:42.733
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG,
DADDY BOY?

19:42.780 --> 19:45.499
[laughs]

19:45.550 --> 19:47.711
- PLEASE, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

19:47.750 --> 19:48.978
- I KNOW THAT SHELLEY
MAY HAVE BEEN SEEING

19:49.020 --> 19:50.442
ANOTHER PLASTIC SURGEON,

19:50.490 --> 19:51.980
A DR. TED LOMAX.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.352
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS ONE OF HIS NUTOX PARTIES.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.711
I KNOW THAT DR. JOAN THINKS
HE MIGHT BE A SUSPECT,

19:56.760 --> 19:57.954
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
OTHER THAN THAT,

19:57.990 --> 19:59.480
I'M COMPLETELY IN THE DARK.

19:59.530 --> 20:01.327
- WELL, HOW DID YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT?

20:01.360 --> 20:03.567
- I HAVE MY WAYS, KID.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.262
BY THE WAY, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
JOAN MAY BE

20:06.300 --> 20:13.536
UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT YOU'RE HARD OF HEARING.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.831
WOW.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.508
LOOK AT ALL THESE
SAD, INSECURE PEOPLE.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.245
- TOTALLY.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.578
- ALL RIGHT.
JUST RELAX.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.917
THIS ISN'T GONNA HURT A BIT.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.508
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PRICK.

20:24.550 --> 20:26.518
- THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY,
DOCTOR.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.552
[laughs]
- SHH.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.251
THERE YOU GO.

20:30.290 --> 20:33.657
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT?
- I'VE HAD BETTER.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.588
- WELL, I'LL TRY HARDER
NEXT TIME.

20:35.630 --> 20:37.359
- I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS

20:37.400 --> 20:40.665
THAT THAT GENTLEMAN
IS OUR DR. TED LOMAX.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.669
- DR. LOMAX.
- LOMAX, TED, DOCTOR.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.531
- WELCOME.
ALWAYS NICE TO SEE NEW FACES.

20:46.570 --> 20:48.435
- MY NAME IS HENRY SPENCER.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.574
BY CHANCE, DID YOU EVER TREAT A
PATIENT NAMED SHELLEY AARONSON?

20:51.610 --> 20:53.840
- BEFORE YOU ANSWER
THAT QUESTION, ANSWER THIS ONE.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.542
WAS SHELLEY AARONSON EVER
A PATIENT OF YOURS?

20:56.580 --> 20:57.786
- AND SINCE WE'RE ON
THE SUBJECT,

20:57.820 --> 20:59.617
DO MY EARLOBES SEEM ABNORMAL
TO YOU?

20:59.650 --> 21:02.687
- NO, BUT YOU SHOULD
DO SOMETHING

21:02.720 --> 21:04.859
ABOUT THAT LARGE
FOREHEAD CREASE.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.482
- CREASE? WHAT CREASE?

21:06.530 --> 21:09.693
MY BLACK IS CRACKING, SHAWN?

21:09.730 --> 21:11.368
- IN ANSWER
TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.368
YES, I USED TO TREAT SHELLEY.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.595
HER MURDER WAS
A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.608
- YOU DON'T SEEM TOO BUSTED UP
ABOUT IT.

21:17.640 --> 21:22.930
MORE LIKE PLEASANTLY AMUSED.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.868
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
AROUND HERE.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.071
- WELL, IT'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING FOR, ISN'T IT?

21:27.110 --> 21:28.646
CARE TO JOIN IN?

21:28.680 --> 21:30.409
I'M RUNNING
A TWO-FOR-ONE SPECIAL.

21:30.450 --> 21:36.958
- PASS.
- PASS...A-DENA.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.958
- LOMAX IS OUR MAN.
- REALLY?

21:38.990 --> 21:41.094
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OBVIOUS?

21:41.130 --> 21:43.496
I MEAN, YOU GAVE ME CRAP FOR
POINTING A FINGER AT DR. JOAN.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.929
WHAT ARE YOU BASING THIS ON?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.632
- INSTINCT AND A FEELING
RIGHT HERE.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.069
- YOU SURE
THAT ISN'T ACID REFLUX?

21:49.100 --> 21:52.069
- A GOOD COP ALWAYS RELIES
ON INSTINCT, SHAWN.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.806
IT COMES FROM 30 YEARS
OF DETECTIVE WORK.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.603
- YEAH, WELL,

21:56.640 --> 21:58.346
REAL FAKE PSYCHICS RELY
ON STUFF

21:58.380 --> 21:59.677
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE
SUBSTANTIAL,

21:59.710 --> 22:01.974
LIKE WHIMS AND WIFFLE SWINGS.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.409
AND IT'S PRECISELY WHAT I'M
GONNA USE TO PROVE YOU WRONG.

22:04.450 --> 22:16.123
- [laughs mockingly]
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

22:16.160 --> 22:29.676
- [exhales]

22:29.710 --> 22:30.745
[knock on table]

22:30.780 --> 22:31.906
HELLO.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.611
YOU WORK FOR DR. LOMAX,
YES?

22:33.650 --> 22:36.016
- I'M LEECY,
HIS ESTHETICIAN.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.109
- SHAWN SPENCER, PSYCHIC.

22:38.150 --> 22:41.813
I'M SENSING THAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LEAVE THIS JOB,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.748
GO WORK FOR SOMEONE
NAMED JOAN.

22:43.790 --> 22:44.882
- WOW.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.659
THAT'S AMAZING.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.055
I START THERE TOMORROW.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.556
- CONGRATULATIONS.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.567
HOW DOES DR. TED FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

22:50.600 --> 22:51.965
OR IS IT HARD TO TELL

22:52.000 --> 22:54.036
ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PERFECT LY
SCULPTED FLAN FACE?

22:54.070 --> 22:56.664
- HE'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.009
HEY, DO YOU KNOW OTHER STUFF,
LIKE, AM I GONNA MEET SOMEONE?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.928
PLEASE TELL ME
HE'S 5'10" OR ABOVE.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.575
- YOU WILL,
BUT HE'S 5'6"...

23:04.610 --> 23:06.942
AND GAY AND MARRIED.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.641
- 5'6"?
- YEAH.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.511
HEY, I'M ALSO SENSING
THAT, UH,

23:10.550 --> 23:13.986
YOU USED TO TREAT
A PATIENT NAMED SHELLEY?

23:14.020 --> 23:15.681
- IT'S SO SAD
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.824
SHE WAS ONE
OF OUR BEST CUSTOMERS.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.555
- I SEE.
SO YOU KNEW HER WELL.

23:19.590 --> 23:20.818
- OF COURSE.
I WAS OVER THERE

23:20.860 --> 23:22.794
BRINGING BEAUTY PRODUCTS
TWO DAYS AGO.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.593
- THE DAY THAT SHE DIED.

23:24.630 --> 23:25.858
- OH, MY GOD.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.993
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I HAD ANY--

23:28.040 --> 23:29.894
LOOK, I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO HURT SOMEONE.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.862
I'M JUST A NICE FARM GIRL
FROM BISMARCK.

23:31.910 --> 23:32.968
- IN SLOVENIA.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.978
- NO.
BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.637
- MY POINT IS THIS.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.500
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING UNUSUAL
ABOUT SHELLEY

23:38.550 --> 23:39.903
THE DAY SHE DIED?

23:39.950 --> 23:42.111
- SHE SEEMED HAPPY.
SHE JUST GOT HER HAIR DONE.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.846
AND SHE DID HAVE A NEW RED
SPORTS CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY,

23:44.890 --> 23:46.642
ONE THAT SHE BOUGHT
FOR HERSELF.

23:46.690 --> 23:47.987
- ANY CHANCE
THAT WAS AN ASTON MARTIN?

23:48.020 --> 23:50.853
_ UH--
- LEECY.

23:50.890 --> 23:58.797
YOU'VE BEEN MORE HELP THAN
YOU COULD POSSIBLE KNOW.

23:58.830 --> 24:03.506
[claps hands,
snaps fingers]

24:03.540 --> 24:06.509
DAD, I GOT BAD NEWS.
ACTUALLY, IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.737
JUST SPOKE WITH A WITNESS
WHO SAW A RED ASTON MARTIN

24:09.780 --> 24:12.499
IN SHELLEY'S DRIVEWAY
ON THE DAY SHE WAS KILLED.

24:12.550 --> 24:15.110
LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE MAKING
CONJUGAL VISITS

24:15.150 --> 24:16.970
TO DR. JOAN AT LOMPOC.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.681
- HEARSAY.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.711
LOMAX DEFINITELY KILLED HER.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.479
ALTHOUGH I'M GONNA PRESUME
THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.157
HE'S A HACK.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.852
HE ACCIDENTALLY SHOT THE STUFF
INTO SHELLEY'S BLOODSTREAM,

24:27.900 --> 24:29.925
AND THEN TRIED TO COVER IT UP
BY MAKING IT LOOK LIKE

24:29.960 --> 24:31.894
SHE WAS ATTACKED
WHILE JOGGING.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.137
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
TWO DIPLOMAS HERE, SHAWN.

24:34.170 --> 24:37.162
TELL ME IF YOU SEE SOMETHING
SIMILAR BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.

24:37.200 --> 24:45.972
- OKAY.

24:46.010 --> 24:47.978
OH, CRAP.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.215
SAME WATERMARK.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.979
- [chuckles]
- SO THEY'RE FAKES.

24:52.020 --> 24:56.059
- SORRY, KID.
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.

24:56.090 --> 24:58.957
[patting]

24:58.990 --> 25:00.890
- HEY, NICE CATCH
ON THOSE FAKE DIPLOMAS, HENRY.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.795
THEY'RE PHOTOCOPIES.

25:02.830 --> 25:05.219
THIS GUY'S NOT A REAL DOCTOR.
- PHOTOCOPIED WHAT?

25:05.270 --> 25:07.830
- ALTHOUGH HE IS AN AUTHORIZED
DISHWASHER SALESMAN.

25:07.870 --> 25:10.293
- WAIT, HE'S NOT LICENSED
TO GIVE BOTULISM INJECT IONS?

25:10.340 --> 25:13.901
UH, WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE
WAS FEELING VULNERABLE AND--

25:13.940 --> 25:15.976
- OH, NO, GUS.
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.

25:16.010 --> 25:16.977
- I JUST LET
AN APPLIANCE SALESMAN

25:17.010 --> 25:18.272
INJECT MY FACE, SHAWN.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.971
- ALL RIGHT, WAXWORKS,
PARTY'S OVER.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.568
HIT THE ROAD.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.848
- SOMEBODY FEED MY CATS.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.916
THEY'RE LOCKED
IN THE BACK BATHROOM.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.885
MARCO POLO AND BUTTONS.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.785
BUTTONS IS ALLERGIC TO WHEAT.
- YOU'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME.

25:29.820 --> 25:36.123
DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.994
- I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THOSE POOR CATS.

25:40.030 --> 25:42.134
DUDE, WHY?

25:42.170 --> 25:46.834
YOU LOOK LIKE GRACE JONES
IN BOOMERANG.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.576
[doorbell rings]

25:48.610 --> 25:52.649
[knock on door]

25:52.680 --> 25:54.875
- JOAN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.808
- [loudly]
AREN'T YOU GONNA INVITE ME IN?

25:56.850 --> 25:58.613
- YEAH, SURE.
COME IN.

25:58.650 --> 26:01.357
- I CAME BY TO THANK YOU!
- WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?

26:01.390 --> 26:03.927
- OH, YOU SAID ON THE PHONE
YOU WERE HARD OF HEARING.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.359
- ON THE PHONE? WHA--

26:05.390 --> 26:08.029
NO, I'M NOT HARD OF--
I'M--I'M OKAY.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.858
JUST A BAD PHONE CONNECTION
AND MY IDIOT SON.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.139
- LOOK, JOAN,
THIS IS VERY SWEET,

26:15.170 --> 26:16.694
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO THANK ME.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.833
YOU HIRED ME TO DO A JOB.
I DID IT.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.360
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

26:20.410 --> 26:23.038
- OKAY.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.344
I GUESS THIS ISN'T PURELY
A BUSINESS THANK YOU.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.369
- IT ISN'T?

26:26.410 --> 26:27.843
- SO HERE'S MY OFFER.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.043
YOU WANT A SHOT
AT THAT SECOND DATE?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.978
YOUR TIME IS NOW.

26:33.020 --> 26:40.995
- I LIKE THE WAY YOU TALK.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.055
- WE CAN TAKE THIS AS SLOW
AS YOU WANT.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.989
OH, I'M SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?
- WITH WHAT?

26:46.030 --> 26:47.634
- WELL, YOU TOLD ME
ON THE PHONE

26:47.670 --> 26:50.264
YOU HADN'T BEEN TOUCHED
BY A WOMAN IN FIVE YEARS.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.131
- OH, PLEASE.
I'M--

26:52.170 --> 26:54.001
I'M ALL ABOUT TOUCHING.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.974
RESPECT FULLY.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.204
- [laughs]

26:57.240 --> 26:59.174
MAY I USE YOUR POWDER ROOM?

26:59.210 --> 27:00.746
- YEAH, SURE.
IT'S JUST UP THE STAIRS.

27:00.780 --> 27:01.872
TO THE RIGHT,
FIRST DOOR ON THE LEFT.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.046
- OKAY.

27:03.080 --> 27:12.182
HOLD MY PLACE.
- YEAH.

27:12.230 --> 27:22.265
DAMN IT.

27:22.270 --> 27:33.909
DAMN IT.

27:33.950 --> 27:43.757
"NUTOX."
WHAT?

27:43.790 --> 27:45.257
[phone camera shutter clicks]

27:45.290 --> 27:46.928
DAMN IT.
THAT'S ME.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.794
MAN, I'M BALD.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.923
[phone camera shutter clicks]

27:52.970 --> 28:00.467
PERFECT.

28:00.510 --> 28:04.446
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

28:04.480 --> 28:06.072
- THAT'S NOT MINE.

28:06.110 --> 28:07.099
- I FOUND IT IN YOUR PURSE,
JOAN.

28:07.150 --> 28:10.074
- YOU WENT THROUGH MY BAG?

28:10.120 --> 28:12.884
I--SOMEONE MUST HAVE PLANTED IT.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.956
- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO REPORT THIS.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.810
THAT'S THE SAME STUFF
THAT KILLED SHELLEY AARONSON.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.179
I CAN'T JUST IGNORE IT.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.982
- I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON MY SIDE.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.452
- I'M ON THE SIDE
OF THE LAW, JOAN.

28:21.500 --> 28:25.322
- THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME.
HENRY, STOP.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.928
- YEAH, HI.
THIS IS HENRY SPENCER.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.268
COULD YOU PUT ME THROUGH
TO DETECTIVE LASSITER?

28:29.300 --> 28:31.006
YEAH, I'LL HOLD.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.258
OH!

28:44.020 --> 28:46.944
- WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS BECAUSE
DR. DIAMOND TOOK YOUR PHONE,

28:46.990 --> 28:48.309
WE DON'T HAVE YOUR PICTURE
OF THE VIAL

28:48.360 --> 28:49.384
OF THE STUFF
THAT'S MAKING GUSTER

28:49.420 --> 28:51.456
LOOK LIKE LITTLE WAYNE NEWTON.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.128
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
WE DO HAVE THE SYRINGE,

28:53.160 --> 28:54.923
WHICH SHE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW
WAS IN YOUR POCKET.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.825
TRACES OF THE VICTIM'S BLOOD
IN THE NEEDLE,

28:56.860 --> 28:58.521
AND WE PULLED ONE OF DIAMOND'S
PRINTS OFF THE PLUNGER.

28:58.570 --> 29:05.169
SORRY, HENRY.
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S OUR KILLER.

29:05.210 --> 29:08.031
- COME ON, POP.
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.968
SO YOU TOOK
A GOOD BASS-WHOOPING.

29:10.010 --> 29:12.069
- YOU GOT
YOUR HALI-BUTT KICKED.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.270
[laughter]

29:13.310 --> 29:15.016
- BUT YOU FOUND
THE MURDER WEAPON.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.369
I MEAN, COME ON.
THAT'S SOMETHING.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.012
- NO, SHAWN.
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF SOMETHING.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.211
I'M DONE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:20.250 --> 29:23.310
- ABOUT DR. JOAN.
- ABOUT ME.

29:23.360 --> 29:28.093
YOU WIN, KID.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.859
- HMM.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.061
THAT WASN'T NEARLY AS FUN
AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.261
- HE WAS BEER-BATTERED.
[laughs]

29:34.300 --> 29:35.836
- THE BIT'S OVER, GUS.

29:35.870 --> 29:38.464
WAIT.
HE WAS S'MACKERELED.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.308
[laughs]
NOW IT'S OVER.

29:41.340 --> 29:45.970
DUDE, THIS PRINT FROM DR. JOAN
IS AN INDEX FINGER.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.477
- SHOULDN'T IT BE
A THUMB PRINT?

29:47.510 --> 29:49.819
- TOTALLY.

29:49.850 --> 29:53.286
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR PRESSES
THE PLUNGER OF A SYRINGE

29:53.320 --> 29:55.288
WITH THEIR INDEX FINGER?

29:55.320 --> 29:57.379
- DO YOU THINK SOMEONE LIFTED
JOAN'S INDEX FINGERPRINT

29:57.420 --> 29:59.024
AND PLANTED IT ON THE SYRINGE?

29:59.060 --> 30:00.357
- MAYBE.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.153
MAYBE SOMEONE LIKE
A FAKE DOCTOR

30:02.200 --> 30:04.828
WHO WOULDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

30:04.870 --> 30:09.136
I BET MY DAD WAS RIGHT
ABOUT DR. TED ALL ALONG.

30:09.170 --> 30:12.560
HERE'S A QUESTION:
TED LOMAX IS STILL A SUSPECT

30:12.610 --> 30:14.134
IN THE MURDER INVESTIGATION.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.374
WHAT'S HE DOING OUT OF JAIL?
HUH, DOC?

30:15.410 --> 30:17.207
- I'M OUT ON BAIL.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.504
- YOU'RE ALREADY FREE AND
MY FACE STILL LOOKS LIKE THIS.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.177
- IT'LL RETURN TO NORMAL
IN A FEW DAYS.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.541
- REALLY?
WAIT, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

30:23.580 --> 30:26.515
- INTUITION
AND PEOPLE MAGAZINE.

30:26.550 --> 30:29.348
BESIDES, I BARELY PUT ANYTHING
IN YOU.

30:29.390 --> 30:30.982
YOU SURE THIS ISN'T
PSYCHOSOMATIC?

30:31.030 --> 30:33.282
I'VE SEEN THAT RESPONSE
IN MANY OF MY PATIENTS.

30:33.330 --> 30:36.128
- I'M SENSING THAT YOU PLANTED
THAT SYRINGE IN JOAN'S PURSE.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.491
- I DID NO SUCH THING.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.464
- SAID THE PRFIITJEl-TSIONAL LIAR.

30:39.500 --> 30:45.132
[phone vibrating]

30:45.170 --> 30:49.209
WHY WOULD JOAN BE CALLING YOU?
- DON'T KNOW.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.243
- ANSWER IT. PUT IT ON SPEAKER
AND ACT NATURAL.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.508
DON'T LET HER KNOW
THAT WE'RE HERE.

30:53.550 --> 30:55.313
- THAT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

30:55.350 --> 30:57.079
- IT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU
WHEN YOU WERE INJECTING

30:57.120 --> 30:58.542
MY DOME WITH POISON.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.957
- RIGHT.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.252
I CAN DO THIS.
I'M TED METUSAK.

31:03.290 --> 31:06.953
I MEAN, LOMAX.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.298
HELLO, JOAN.
- TED, LISTEN.

31:08.330 --> 31:09.922
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.928
YOU WERE TREATING SHELLEY
AFTER SHE SUED ME.

31:11.970 --> 31:15.030
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF WHO WOULD WANT TO KILL HER?

31:15.070 --> 31:18.528
- YOU?
- DAMN IT, YOU'RE NO HELP.

31:18.570 --> 31:23.405
[phone clicks]
- THERE.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.375
- YOU'RE ALL CLASS, METUSAK.

31:26.410 --> 31:28.947
IF JOAN KILLED SHELLEY,
WHY IS SHE CALLING AROUND,

31:28.980 --> 31:31.084
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED SHELLEY?

31:31.120 --> 31:32.417
BETWEEN THAT
AND THE WEIRD FINGERPRINT,

31:32.450 --> 31:34.384
IT SOUNDS LIKE JOAN
GOT FRAMED.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.911
- BUT IF SHE DIDN'T KILL HER,
THEN WHY DID SHE HIT YOUR DAD?

31:36.960 --> 31:38.222
- SHE MUST HAVE PANICKED,
I GUESS.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.249
I MEAN, SHE HAD
THE MURDER WEAPON ON HER

31:39.290 --> 31:40.450
FOR SOME REASON.

31:40.490 --> 31:41.957
WE GOTTA FIND THIS WOMAN.
- WAIT.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.092
DIDN'T YOU SET UP
YOUR DAD'S PHONE?

31:43.130 --> 31:45.189
IF SHE HAS IT,
WE CAN TRACK IT.

31:45.230 --> 31:52.238
- [claps]

31:52.270 --> 31:53.407
DAD!

31:53.440 --> 31:56.932
- GO AHEAD.
GLOAT.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.141
- ACTUALLY, SHOCKINGLY,
THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.977
- WE THINK JOAN IS INNOCENT.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.045
- SHE WHACKED ME WITH A FISH.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.480
DESTROYED A BEAUTIFULLY MOUNTED
NORTHERN PIKE. SHE'S GUILTY.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.044
- ALL RIGHT,
FIRST OF ALL, POP,

32:07.090 --> 32:09.012
YOU GOTTA TREAT THAT THING
LIKE YOUR BABY MAKER.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.687
HUH? BE THE BALL.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.052
SECONDLY, ONLY ONE
OF JOAN'S FINGERPRINTS

32:13.090 --> 32:14.193
TURNED UP ON THAT SYRINGE.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.356
GET THIS:

32:15.400 --> 32:17.152
IT WAS THE INDEX FINGER.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.667
- YOU SAYING IT WAS PLANTED?

32:18.700 --> 32:20.019
- HELL, YEAH,
I THINK IT WAS PLANTED.

32:20.070 --> 32:22.436
AND SHE JUST CALLED DR. TED
TO ASK HIM

32:22.470 --> 32:25.109
IF HE KNEW OF ANYONE WITH MOTIVE
TO KILL SHELLEY.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.732
- GOOD, GOOD.
JUST STAY THE COURSE.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.477
YOU DON'T NEED AN OLD MAN
TO SLOW YOU DOWN.

32:29.510 --> 32:31.068
- THERE'S MORE.

32:31.110 --> 32:33.670
YOUR PHONE,
AN OLD 8X10 GLOSSY,

32:33.710 --> 32:36.178
AND A NOTE
FROM DR. JOAN TO YOU

32:36.220 --> 32:37.448
LEFT IN YOUR MAILBOX.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.118
- LET ME SEE IT.
- LET ME READ IT TO YOU.

32:39.150 --> 32:40.117
IT'LL BE MORE DRAMATIC.
- NO, NO, NO, GIVE IT TO ME!

32:40.150 --> 32:41.981
IT WAS MEANT FOR ME.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.682
"HENRY, BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU I'M INNOCENT.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.153
"HOPEFULLY, I'LL BE ABLE TO
PROVE IT TO YOU SOON.

32:47.190 --> 32:49.021
"IF I DID ANY DAMAGE
TO YOUR HEAD WITH THAT FISH,

32:49.060 --> 32:52.359
JUST KNOW THAT I CAN FIX IT."

32:52.400 --> 32:55.130
- CHECK THE PIC.

32:55.170 --> 32:57.161
IT'S NICE, RIGHT?
- OOH.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.100
[chuckles]

32:59.140 --> 33:00.664
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.735
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
DOUBTED MY GUT.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.749
THAT'S IT.
LET'S GO, BOYS.

33:05.780 --> 33:07.338
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.371
YOUR PANTS ARE ROLLED UP.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.786
YOU KNEW DAMN WELL
WE WERE GONNA COME HERE

33:11.820 --> 33:14.050
AND GIVE YOU THE RAH-RAH SPEECH,
DIDN'T YOU?

33:14.090 --> 33:15.284
- I HAD A STRONG SENSE OF IT.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.255
YOU SEE, I STILL HAD
THIS SEED OF DOUBT.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.087
I JUST COULDN'T CRACK
THE CASE.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.052
BUT I KNEW THAT IF YOU TWO
PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER,

33:22.100 --> 33:23.795
YOU'D COME UP WITH SOMETHING
AND YOU DID.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.229
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.022
YOU CAME UP WITH A NEW PIECE
OF EVIDENCE.

33:27.070 --> 33:28.298
YOU FOUND MY CELL PHONE.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.035
- AM I REALLY
THAT PREDICT ABLE?

33:33.740 --> 33:34.809
BACK WHEN I WAS ON THE FORCE,
WE USED TO SAY

33:34.840 --> 33:36.478
YOU'RE NEVER OUT OF SUSPECTS.

33:36.510 --> 33:39.604
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAD
TO GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.538
WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON
THAT YOU LOOKED INTO?

33:41.580 --> 33:43.047
- JOAN WAS OUR FIRST SUSPECT.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.048
BUT THEN WE LOOKED INTO
SHELLEY'S HUSBAND, BRAD.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.615
BUT WE MOVED OFF OF HIM BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MOTIVE.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.709
HE VOLUNTARILY SIGNED A PRENUP
BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.125
- WHICH MEANS HE WOULDN'T GET

33:51.160 --> 33:52.058
ANY MONEY
FROM A DIVORCE HEARING.

33:52.090 --> 33:54.229
BUT IF SOMEBODY KILLED HER...

33:54.260 --> 33:58.060
- LIFE INSURANCE.
- UH-HUH.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.419
- SOMEONE WITH HER STACK WOULD
HAVE TO HAVE A BIG POLICY.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.529
- AND NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD,

34:01.570 --> 34:03.834
ALL THAT MONEXHGOES TO BRAD.

34:03.870 --> 34:11.845
- THIS IS GOOD.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.199
- BRAD TURNER, SBPD.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.138
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO COME WITH US.

34:15.180 --> 34:16.841
LET'S GET THOSE HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM.

34:16.880 --> 34:24.127
MR. TURNER?

34:24.160 --> 34:27.186
- UH-OH.

34:27.230 --> 34:31.667
THAT IS ONE UNHAPPY ENDING.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.104
- DID YOU SLEEP HERE LAST NIGHT?

34:39.140 --> 34:41.779
- NO, ACTUALLY,
I CRASH HERE ALL THE TIME.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.630
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SMELL
OF FORMALDEHYDE

34:43.680 --> 34:45.204
JUST LULLS ME TO SLEEP.

34:45.250 --> 34:52.144
I THINK IT'S THE SCENT.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.887
- LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ANOTHER
OVERDOSE FROM INJECT ED BOTULISM.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.751
- SO YOU THINK WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE SAME KILLER?

34:57.790 --> 34:59.326
- WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.397
AND JOAN KILLED SHELLEY BECAUSE
SHE'S SUING HER.

35:02.430 --> 35:03.692
THEN THE HUSBAND
FIGURES IT OUT,

35:03.730 --> 35:05.220
HE CONFRONTS HER,
SHE KILLS HIM TOO.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.897
SHE'S GUILTY
AS MRS. O'LEARY'S COW

35:06.930 --> 35:08.739
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
TILL WE FIND HER.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.863
[cell phone rings]
- O'HARA.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.401
- YEAH, I THINK
JOAN IS INNOCENT.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.737
-SO DO I.

35:13.770 --> 35:14.737
- WELL, SHE MUST HAVE
FISH-SLAPPED YOU

35:14.780 --> 35:15.735
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.804
WHAT ARE YOU BASING THIS ON?

35:16.840 --> 35:18.205
- THE SPIRITS.
- MY GUT.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.899
- GREAT.
SO I GOT GHOSTS AND CELLULITE.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.315
I DON'T EVEN NEED
AN ARREST WARRANT.

35:21.350 --> 35:22.817
- GOT IT, THANKS.

35:22.850 --> 35:23.874
THEY JUST SPOTTED
JOAN'S ASTON MARTIN

35:23.920 --> 35:25.239
HEADING TOWARD
DIAMOND SURGICAL.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.917
- AND WE WILL BE WAITING
FOR HER.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.417
- SO WILL I.
- NO, YOU WON'T.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.553
COME ON, O'HARA.

35:30.590 --> 35:37.598
- THANK YOU.

35:37.630 --> 35:40.827
- I'M JUST A NICE FARM GIRL
FROM BISMARCK.

35:40.870 --> 35:47.867
- BRAD AND LEECY WERE BOTH
FROM BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA.

35:47.910 --> 35:52.779
- SBPD, GET YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR.

35:52.810 --> 35:55.415
DID YOU HEAR ME?
- YES, BUT I CAN'T LIFT MY ARMS

35:55.450 --> 35:57.941
UNTIL MY IMPLANTS HEAL.
- YOU'RE NOT JOKING, ARE YOU?

35:57.980 --> 36:01.689
- EVERYONE PUT
YOUR HANDS DOWN.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.449
- WHERE'S DR. DIAMOND?

36:03.490 --> 36:05.481
- I'M NOT SURE.
IT'S MY FIRST DAY.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.282
- SHE WAS JUST SEEN ENTERING
THE BUILDING.

36:07.330 --> 36:09.855
- DO NOT LIE TO US.
WHERE IS DR. DIAMOND?

36:09.900 --> 36:11.697
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

36:11.730 --> 36:12.958
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER

36:13.000 --> 36:14.638
OF SHELLEY AARONSON
AND BRAD TURNER.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.831
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
- UH, LASSIE?

36:16.870 --> 36:19.304
I'M NOT SO BULLISH
ON YOUR BULL'S-EYE.

36:19.340 --> 36:20.932
YOU NEED TO UNCROSS
YOUR CROSSHAIRS.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.507
- LAND THE PLANE, SPENCER.
- SHAWN'S RIGHT, CARLTON.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.644
LEECY HERE IS OUR MURDERER.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.477
- WHAT?
- GUS, SHOW 'EM.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.774
- LEECY'S ARREST RECORD
FROM BISMARCK.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.482
- WE RAN IT AFTER SHAWN
HAD A VISION.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.942
- COUPLE OF FRAUD CHARGES
AND AN ARREST FOR THEFT.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.688
- SHE AND BRAD WERE
HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS

36:37.720 --> 36:39.278
BACK IN BISMARCK
WHERE THEY MADE A HABIT

36:39.330 --> 36:40.786
OF SCAMMING RICH PEOPLE.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.388
- TWO YEARS LATER,
THEY COME TO SANTA BARBARA

36:42.430 --> 36:44.466
AND TARGET ONE
OF THE RICHEST GALS IN TOWN,

36:44.500 --> 36:45.899
SHELLEY AARONSON.

36:45.930 --> 36:47.864
- THE PLAN WAS SIMPLE.
HE WOULD SEDUCE HER,

36:47.900 --> 36:49.891
TIE THE KNOT,
AND THEN HE'D TAKE SHELLEY

36:49.940 --> 36:51.737
FOR EVERY DIME SHE HAS
IN THE DIVORCE.

36:51.770 --> 36:54.238
- THEN BRAD AND LEECY SKIP OUT
OF TOWN WITH ALL THE DOUGH,

36:54.280 --> 36:55.975
BUT THERE WAS A WRINKLE.
BRAD FELL IN LOVE WITH...

36:56.010 --> 36:56.977
- SHELLEY FELL IN LOVE
WITH BRAD.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.898
- SH ELLY.
- WHAT?

36:58.950 --> 37:00.804
I WAS GONNA TAKE THAT PART.
- BUT YOU GOT THE WRINKLE PART.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.715
- WHAT'S FUN ABOUT SAYING,
"BUT THERE WAS A WRINKLE"?

37:02.750 --> 37:03.944
- IT'S THE TURN.

37:03.980 --> 37:04.878
- WOULD YOU TWO
JUST GET ON WITH IT?

37:04.920 --> 37:06.581
- EXCUSE ME, LASSIE.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.985
YOU TRY DOING A BREAKDOWN
WITH YOUR FATHER.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.817
- BRAD FELL FOR SHELLEY
AND AGREED TO SIGN A PRENUP,

37:09.860 --> 37:12.454
THUS DESTROYING LEECY'S CHANGES
OF EVER GETTING HER MONEY.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.889
- PLUS, SHE LOST HER MAN
IN THE PROCESS.

37:13.930 --> 37:15.921
- EXACT-AMUNDO.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.928
SO IN A JEALOUS RAGE...

37:17.960 --> 37:18.995
[hisses, blows raspberry]

37:19.030 --> 37:21.863
SHE KILLED SHELLEY.

37:21.900 --> 37:27.634
[thud]

37:27.670 --> 37:30.571
AND PINS IT ON POOR DR. JOAN...

37:30.610 --> 37:34.046
TO WHOM I OWE
A TEXAS-SIZED APOLOGY.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.945
I WAS LEECY
WHO PLANTED THE VIALS

37:35.980 --> 37:37.572
IN DR. JOAN'S BAG
WHILE SHE WAS UP HERE

37:37.620 --> 37:38.644
FILLING OUT PAPERWORK.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.884
FINAL TWIST?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.387
BRAD GOT SUSPICIOUS.

37:41.420 --> 37:46.926
- SO SHE KILLS HIM TOO.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.451
- [gaSPSJ

37:49.500 --> 37:51.024
- THINGS GOT OUT OF CONTROL.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.893
I LOVED BRAD.
- YEAH.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.898
TO DEATH.
- SNAP!

37:55.940 --> 38:00.331
POP, THAT IS SOME QUALITY
OLD-SCHOOL SMACK TALK.

38:00.370 --> 38:08.948
- PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND
YOUR BACK.

38:08.980 --> 38:12.689
- EXCUSE ME,
DID YOU GET YOUR WORK DONE HERE?

38:12.720 --> 38:17.851
- NO.
- [sighs in relief]

38:17.890 --> 38:20.882
- THAT WAS COLD-BLOODED.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.592
- DUDE, I'VE GOT HUGE NEWS.

38:24.630 --> 38:27.565
JULES AND I
ARE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.567
- OOH.
- OFFICIALLY.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.737
SHE MADE ME WORK FOR IT,

38:29.770 --> 38:31.704
BUT I CAME ALL THE WAY BACK.

38:31.740 --> 38:32.968
SHE COULDN'T
RESIST THIS FOREVER.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.932
- I HEAR THAT.
I GOT GOOD NEWS TOO.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.538
I THINK I GOT MY FACE BACK.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.070
CHECK IT OUT.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.839
- WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

38:39.880 --> 38:41.939
I'M SEEING WHIMSICAL

38:41.980 --> 38:43.049
WITH A TOUCH OF CONSTIPATION.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.638
- WHAT?
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.487
- COME ON, SON.
- COME ON, SON.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.954
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T EXPRESS IT,

38:48.990 --> 38:50.412
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.927
- CANNOT EXPLAIN COLOR
TO A BLIND MAN.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.621
- I AM BEAUTIFUL, SHAWN.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.025
I AM A BEAUTIFUL MAN,

38:55.060 --> 38:57.597
AND I'M GOING TO STICK
WITH WHAT GOD GAVE ME.

38:57.630 --> 38:59.461
I LOST TRACK OF THAT
BECAUSE I WAS FREAKING OUT

38:59.500 --> 39:01.024
OVER THIS WHOLE SITUATION
WITH RACHAEL.

39:01.070 --> 39:02.833
AND YES, SHE'S IN LONDON.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.861
AND YES, HER EX-HUSBAND
IS THERE.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.366
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED?

39:06.410 --> 39:08.833
NO MATTER HOW IT
ALL PLAYS OUT,

39:08.880 --> 39:11.849
BURTON GUSTER IS GONNA
BE JUST FINE.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.142
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

39:13.180 --> 39:14.716
- THANK YOU.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.116
- HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

39:17.150 --> 39:19.812
- WHAT? I CAN'T POP IN
ON MY TWO FAVORITE DELINQUENTS?

39:19.850 --> 39:22.785

ME ON OUR SECOND DATE.

39:22.820 --> 39:25.152
- AND SOMEBODT’IMWES ME A FISH.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.993

39:31.030 --> 39:33.021
GUS DOES THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
VERSION OF FACE OFF

39:33.070 --> 39:34.628
WITH HIMSELF.

39:34.670 --> 39:40.006
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE,
ABOUT 20x25?

39:40.040 --> 39:42.406
- WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:42.440 --> 39:44.032
- I'M JUST MULLING THINGS OVER.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.002
WHAT ARE UTILITIES HERE?

39:46.050 --> 39:47.176
- OH, MY GOSH.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.711
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT COMING OUT

39:48.750 --> 39:50.513
OF RETIREMENT AGAIN,
AREN'T YOU?

39:50.550 --> 39:52.017
- I'M THINKING ABOUT HANGING
A SHINGLE OF MY OWN. YEAH.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.608
- I THINK YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT GETTING SHINGLES.

39:53.650 --> 39:54.651
CONTRACTING THEM.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.487
- FUNNY.
[laughs mockingly]

39:56.520 --> 39:57.817
LOOK, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME
TAKING A CASE HERE OR THERE?

40:00.560 --> 40:02.949
- UNLESS OF COURSE, YOU'RE
AFRAID OF THE COMPETITION.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.867
- ARE YOU HEARING THIS?

40:05.900 --> 40:07.527
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

40:07.570 --> 40:08.730
THESE MUST BE
FROM MY PUBLISHER.

40:08.770 --> 40:10.169
- YOU DON'T HAVE A PUBLISHER.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.838
YOU SENT PAGES TO A PRINTER,
AND IT WASN'T

40:11.870 --> 40:12.939
EVEN A REAL PRINTER.

40:12.970 --> 40:15.177
IT WAS DR. TED.

40:15.210 --> 40:16.837
