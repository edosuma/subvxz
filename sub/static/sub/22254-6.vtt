WEBVTT

00:09.985 --> 00:13.821
As your accountant, I felt it
necessary to do this in person.

00:13.822 --> 00:16.574
Us, too. Because we're
really accounting on you...

00:16.575 --> 00:18.742
- No.
- to get in on the ground floor of this...

00:18.743 --> 00:20.453
No, don't do this. Please, God, no.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.663
...PB Livin' product.

00:21.664 --> 00:23.998
Has this ever happened to you?

00:23.999 --> 00:27.210
Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me.

00:27.211 --> 00:30.421
- You say you love a toasted bagel.
- I would never say that.

00:30.422 --> 00:33.734
- I have celiac disease.
- Ding. Bagel's ready.

00:33.758 --> 00:35.426
- But wait.
- Son of a...

00:35.427 --> 00:37.970
- Hey. That bagel was too fast.
- No.

00:37.971 --> 00:41.432
That's why PB Livin'
presents, the Bagel Catcher.

00:41.433 --> 00:44.602
- For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
- No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

00:44.603 --> 00:46.937
Stop talking! I can't take it anymore!

00:46.938 --> 00:48.939
PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.151
- I'm shutting you down.
- I thought you were a customer.

00:52.152 --> 00:53.695
I don't get what's happening.

00:53.696 --> 00:56.864
What's happening is you two
knuckleheads threw thousands of dollars

00:56.865 --> 00:58.700
into a bunch of dumb ideas.

00:58.701 --> 01:02.412
You paid 50 grand to a
bunch of kindergartners

01:02.413 --> 01:04.788
for the movie rights to the game "tag."

01:04.789 --> 01:07.083
Our business manager was
over the moon for that.

01:07.084 --> 01:09.793
Business manager? Who the
hell is your business manager?

01:09.794 --> 01:14.441
Business-wise, this all seems
like appropriate business.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.092
You two are done.

01:16.093 --> 01:20.346
This company is more in the
red than Carrie on prom night.

01:20.347 --> 01:25.309
So, what you're saying is, we're just
one great idea away from breaking even?

01:25.310 --> 01:27.771
No. You're... You are out of money.

01:27.772 --> 01:31.482
Mr. Peanutbutter, you need to get a job.

01:31.483 --> 01:34.919
- Are you hiring at your accounting firm?
- Dude, no.

01:39.157 --> 01:41.951
I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.

01:41.952 --> 01:44.722
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

01:44.996 --> 01:48.874
Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.563
I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.649
Maybe I should just go check on him.

01:56.592 --> 02:00.261
Hello, Ronnie? It's your
favorite client, Mr. Peanutbutter.

02:00.262 --> 02:03.013
Well, I'm coming in. I hope
you're... Oh! Oh, my God.

02:03.014 --> 02:05.015
Ronnie, how'd you get
that belt around your neck,

02:05.016 --> 02:07.685
then caught on the filing cabinet,
which made your pants fall down

02:07.686 --> 02:11.748
while you were researching pornograph...
Oh, I see what happened here.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.455 --> 03:10.038
Morning time, Hollywoo.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.334
- I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
- And I'm Some Lady.

03:13.335 --> 03:14.960
Here's a thing written on a card.

03:14.961 --> 03:19.357
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie
Bonito was found dead in his office...

03:19.424 --> 03:20.382
Ruh-roh.

03:20.384 --> 03:23.969
...in what authorities are calling
a mishap of a sexual nature.

03:23.970 --> 03:28.391
- What does that mean?
- You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

03:28.392 --> 03:30.226
Auto-a-what's it who's it?

03:30.227 --> 03:33.145
Oh, is that that thing
where you strangle yourself

03:33.146 --> 03:35.857
in an attempt to
heighten sexual arousal?

03:35.858 --> 03:37.668
It sure is.

03:40.070 --> 03:43.531
Coming up, a food truck that
serves just one thing: gravy.

03:43.532 --> 03:45.199
Did you hear that? New food truck.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.743
- We should go.
- I'm in.

03:46.744 --> 03:49.328
Hey, can I get some lunch
money? It's pizza day today.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.622
Sure thing, sport. Wait,
where is it pizza day?

03:51.623 --> 03:53.332
- In my tummy.
- Oh...

03:53.333 --> 03:56.419
Hey, BoJack, would you zip me
up? My shoulder is killing me.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.714
I'm not sleeping right. We need
to do something about that bed.

03:59.715 --> 04:02.484
Just because I'm nocturnal doesn't
mean I wanna be up all night.

04:02.509 --> 04:05.177
- I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
- It still wobbles.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.346
- Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.
- Oh.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.391
A beeper? BoJack, it's great,
but you know, I already have one.

04:10.392 --> 04:12.602
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.

04:12.603 --> 04:15.145
Now, you can page me whenever you want.

04:15.146 --> 04:18.942
Huh. BoJack, I love it, and
you're gonna love it, too.

04:18.942 --> 04:21.067
There's all kinds of codes
we can send each other.

04:21.069 --> 04:22.986
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"

04:22.987 --> 04:27.450
and "1-2-3" is "I miss you"
and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

04:27.451 --> 04:29.619
What? Boobs? Oh, my God.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.346
What scamp came up with that one?

04:31.371 --> 04:33.122
Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

04:33.123 --> 04:35.792
Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

04:35.793 --> 04:37.936
Okay, love you.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.270
Uh...

04:39.630 --> 04:40.939
Uh...

04:42.257 --> 04:43.901
No, I don't.

04:44.885 --> 04:48.112
Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?

04:49.514 --> 04:51.933
Uh... Keys.

04:51.934 --> 04:53.100
Uh-oh.

04:59.524 --> 05:01.043
Get out.

05:12.329 --> 05:14.681
Hold it. Hold the elevator.

05:14.790 --> 05:17.768
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.

05:17.876 --> 05:19.877
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.

05:19.878 --> 05:22.296
Oh. Ow. Oh...

05:22.297 --> 05:24.858
Coffee? Hup.

05:24.883 --> 05:27.510
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.

05:27.511 --> 05:29.929
My heel broke while I was
at this new food truck,

05:29.930 --> 05:32.181
and I spilled a handful
of gravy all over myself

05:32.182 --> 05:35.392
because they don't
sell bowls, just gravy.

05:35.393 --> 05:38.521
Should've gone to the bowl truck
first. That's where they get you.

05:38.522 --> 05:41.190
Well, I guess the upside to
being invisible around here

05:41.191 --> 05:44.568
is that none of these assholes
will ever notice what a mess I am.

05:44.569 --> 05:47.196
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, I see what a mess you are.

05:47.197 --> 05:48.590
Aw...

05:48.699 --> 05:50.574
Do you need the movie-star speech?

05:50.575 --> 05:53.786
No, no, I'll be okay. And how are you?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.746
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.

05:55.747 --> 05:58.415
I have to pick a shade that won't
clash with the splatter of blood

05:58.416 --> 06:00.960
from when I blow my brains
out after talking to Katie

06:00.961 --> 06:04.106
about paint swatches all day.

06:04.214 --> 06:05.857
We do have fun.

06:10.054 --> 06:13.180
So, what's the plan for today?
Find a new agent, go on auditions?

06:13.181 --> 06:17.894
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me
Mr. Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.

06:17.895 --> 06:20.063
Wander around L.A. with an open mind

06:20.064 --> 06:22.523
and an empty stomach
until I get discovered.

06:22.524 --> 06:25.359
But also, like, find a new
agent and go on auditions, right?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.444
Or should I start
stealing food from work?

06:27.445 --> 06:30.823
I'm just gonna go with the flow
and leave everything up to destiny.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.368
- Que sera quesadilla.
- You know we could lose the house, right?

06:34.369 --> 06:36.346
- Diane.
- Right?

06:36.371 --> 06:38.539
Diane, Diane, Diane.

06:48.717 --> 06:49.651
- Diane.
- Aah!

06:49.676 --> 06:52.595
I wasn't stealing paper towels
to use as dinner napkins. Why?

06:52.596 --> 06:54.179
Here's a funny question for you:

06:54.180 --> 06:56.640
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"

06:56.641 --> 07:00.019
would you need to talk about that
later and figure out what he meant?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.772
Probably not, right? Because
they're meaningless words?

07:02.773 --> 07:04.440
I mean, language evolves, right?

07:04.441 --> 07:06.358
How can anyone know what anything means?

07:06.359 --> 07:08.694
The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.571
So why bother talking about anything?

07:10.572 --> 07:13.657
In this scenario, are Mr.
Peanutbutter and I living in our house?

07:13.658 --> 07:17.286
Or are we squatting in an abandoned
Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm

07:17.287 --> 07:19.789
as we struggle through our
Dickensian-style poverty?

07:19.790 --> 07:20.706
Uh...

07:22.126 --> 07:24.543
"Zero, zero, zero." No
idea what that means.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.087
I think it means "call me."

07:26.088 --> 07:28.422
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?

07:28.423 --> 07:29.757
How do I ignore?

07:29.758 --> 07:32.318
I think with a beeper,
you just ignore it.

07:32.343 --> 07:35.387
- With what, my mind?
- You seem a little stressed out.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.640
That's because as soon
as I'm done with work,

07:37.641 --> 07:39.725
I have to have a long,
awkward conversation

07:39.726 --> 07:44.229
with Wanda about our relationship,
unless... I'm never done with work.

07:44.230 --> 07:47.417
Diane, you magnificent
bastard. That's it.

07:53.448 --> 07:55.032
I'll be out there in the stands.

07:55.033 --> 07:57.052
And I'll be rooting
for you, Secretariat.

07:57.368 --> 08:00.346
Mm. Yeah.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.794
Your line is, "And I'll
see you at the finish line."

08:06.795 --> 08:10.756
Yeah, I know. I'm acting. Great.
Now I gotta start all over.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.151
Settle in, folks. We
could be here a while.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.015
- Ow! Ooh.
- Ah, Princess Carolyn.

08:19.016 --> 08:21.684
So good of you to join us eventually.

08:21.685 --> 08:24.020
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

08:24.021 --> 08:26.480
You know who had an even
"the worst-er" morning?

08:26.481 --> 08:29.566
- Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.
- He is?

08:29.567 --> 08:31.902
He decided to strangle the dirty dangle

08:31.903 --> 08:35.655
and now that sweet chariot
has come for to carry him home.

08:35.657 --> 08:38.885
Everyone who was here on
time is taking a moment.

08:40.162 --> 08:41.953
- Of silence?
- Yes.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.041
Also to reach out to his former clients.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.710
- To offer their condolences?
- Yes.

08:47.711 --> 08:50.546
Also to recruit them
to the Vigor roster.

08:50.547 --> 08:53.966
- A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
- Who do you want me to call?

08:53.967 --> 08:57.988
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's
clients including all the major J's:

08:58.013 --> 09:02.058
- Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.
- Oh, that's wonderful news

09:02.059 --> 09:05.435
in the parallel universe in
which you were on time today.

09:05.436 --> 09:08.355
In this reality,
however, we're all good.

09:08.356 --> 09:10.691
You can lap up the leftovers though.

09:10.692 --> 09:13.402
- "Mr. Peanutbutter"?
- Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

09:13.403 --> 09:14.737
Get your shoe fixed.

09:14.738 --> 09:17.799
You look like a woman from
an '80s deodorant commercial.

09:24.039 --> 09:28.101
Here I go. Destiny, don't fail me now.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.546
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

09:32.547 --> 09:35.025
This is how it happens
for a guy like me.

09:41.056 --> 09:43.574
Ew...

09:43.808 --> 09:45.869
Out of my way, flyer.

09:46.686 --> 09:50.773
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?

09:50.774 --> 09:53.358
Wait, a second. Shoe.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.069
Store.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.714
Shoe store? Shoe store.

09:57.781 --> 09:59.406
"Team players wanted"?

09:59.407 --> 10:01.491
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

10:01.492 --> 10:04.595
I make all the other team
players look like garbage.

10:04.621 --> 10:07.932
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

10:12.921 --> 10:15.523
Finish...

10:17.467 --> 10:19.194
line.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.221
Great, we got it. We got one take.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.973
And now we gotta stop for the day.

10:23.974 --> 10:25.266
What? No. Why stop now?

10:25.267 --> 10:29.019
- I'm just getting warmed up.
- Union rules. We're done. Go home.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.271
Go home?

10:30.272 --> 10:34.233
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.902
- Drinks on me, folks.
- I could use a drink.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.589
- Or six.
- Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.260
Ah...

10:43.367 --> 10:45.368
- I really needed this, BoJack.
- Me, too.

10:45.369 --> 10:47.621
Yeah, man. This day's
been really hard on me.

10:47.622 --> 10:50.874
Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?

10:50.875 --> 10:52.876
- Blue-face blastoff?
- The strokey chokey?

10:52.877 --> 10:54.377
- The two-neck squeeze?
- What?

10:54.378 --> 10:56.672
You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,

10:56.673 --> 10:58.841
the other one's on the Adam's banana?

10:58.842 --> 11:02.112
Oh, right. Right.
Yeah. The auto-erotic...

11:02.137 --> 11:05.014
That could've been me. I used
to really be into that stuff.

11:05.015 --> 11:06.598
I was a hardcore gasper.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.391
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.

11:08.392 --> 11:10.144
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

11:10.145 --> 11:12.395
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

11:12.396 --> 11:14.148
Don't need to talk
about how you masturbate.

11:14.149 --> 11:16.441
- The orgasms you get...
- Okay, I guess we do.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.236
It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.

11:19.237 --> 11:21.947
- So, like a normal rainbow?
- But it's too dangerous, man.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.159
They say if you bite down on a
lemon right at the point of climax,

11:25.160 --> 11:28.578
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.

11:28.579 --> 11:32.833
But still man, you're
just... rolling the dice.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.002
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

11:35.003 --> 11:36.795
Can we maybe talk about anything else?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.505
- Sure.
- Thank God.

11:38.506 --> 11:43.153
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
God, because my new thing is... the Bible.

11:43.345 --> 11:44.261
Uh...

11:44.262 --> 11:48.598
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus
Christ as your Lord and personal savior?

11:48.599 --> 11:51.894
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot

11:51.895 --> 11:53.913
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?

12:03.114 --> 12:05.782
- I beeped you, BoJack.
- Oh, hey. About this morning...

12:05.783 --> 12:07.784
- It's fine.
- Because when I said that...

12:07.785 --> 12:10.162
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.998
That's okay. I don't love you.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.601
- What?
- Good night.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.047
Morning time, Hollywoo.

12:20.048 --> 12:23.217
- I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
- And I'm Some Lady.

12:23.218 --> 12:26.321
On today's show, I sit
down with Hank Hippopopalous

12:26.346 --> 12:29.723
to discuss his new smash hit,
Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

12:29.724 --> 12:31.641
Can you talk about your process?

12:31.642 --> 12:33.894
When I see someone, and
I think they can dance,

12:33.895 --> 12:36.855
I say, "Hey, I think you can dance."

12:36.856 --> 12:41.235
And when I think they can't dance, I
say, "No, I don't think you can dance."

12:41.236 --> 12:44.047
- And that is pretty much it.
- Fascinating.

12:44.989 --> 12:48.158
- So, last night when...
- BoJack, it's not a big deal.

12:48.159 --> 12:50.077
You don't love me, I don't love you.

12:50.078 --> 12:52.329
We're having a good time. It's fine.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.497
Can't just say, "I don't
love you" to someone.

12:54.498 --> 12:56.917
- You said it to me.
- Yeah, but that was different.

12:56.918 --> 12:59.586
- How was that different?
- Because you do love me. Right?

12:59.587 --> 13:01.297
- Like a little bit?
- No.

13:01.298 --> 13:04.633
Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.

13:04.634 --> 13:06.944
Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.392
Here you go, ma'am.

13:15.228 --> 13:19.106
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

13:19.107 --> 13:20.417
Mr. Peanutbutter?

13:21.651 --> 13:25.321
Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?

13:25.322 --> 13:29.532
Either way, it's a
brand-new pair of shoes!

13:33.288 --> 13:34.847
Oh.

13:35.039 --> 13:37.124
Hup. Carolyn.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.501
- Rutabaga...
- Coffee?

13:38.502 --> 13:40.627
I was thinking about you last night

13:40.628 --> 13:44.423
while Katie and I were locked in a
fascinating debate about counter granite.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.801
And what if I told you I used
to work Ronnie Bonito's desk,

13:47.802 --> 13:50.863
and I happen to know that
he had a client so hush-hush,

13:50.888 --> 13:55.267
- it wasn't even on the master list.
- What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

13:56.186 --> 14:00.689
Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?

14:00.690 --> 14:02.941
The author of Catcher in the Rye?

14:02.942 --> 14:05.402
- And... others?
- Yuh-huh.

14:05.403 --> 14:07.821
- Isn't he dead?
- He's "reclusive."

14:07.822 --> 14:12.075
Dude wanted to be left alone
so much, he faked his own death.

14:12.076 --> 14:13.369
Oh, my God.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.120
Why are you giving this lead to me?

14:15.121 --> 14:17.747
- Because I like you, dummy.
- Huh.

14:17.748 --> 14:21.478
Now we gotta wait for the fire department
to come let us out of this elevator.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.050
- Hey.
- Corduroy, what are you doing here?

14:28.051 --> 14:30.302
I need a favor. Can you
hold on to this for me?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.780
- Ew. Is this your Bible?
- No, no, no.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.848
- It's my choking-off kit.
- Your kit?

14:34.849 --> 14:36.308
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.436
Silk ties, a leather
gag, velvet sock. Lemon.

14:39.437 --> 14:42.523
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.

14:42.524 --> 14:44.649
I don't know if I want your
jack-off kit at my house.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.860
Please. I got this
girlfriend. She loves me.

14:46.861 --> 14:50.155
If I fall back into the old
gasp-and-goo, it'll break her heart.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.991
Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,

14:52.992 --> 14:55.702
they don't want you to choke
yourself while masturbating?

14:55.703 --> 14:57.681
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

14:57.705 --> 14:59.789
- All right. I'll take it.
- Thanks, BoJack.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.875
I still don't understand
why you need a kit.

15:01.876 --> 15:03.936
Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?

15:03.961 --> 15:05.921
Oh, I guess.

15:05.922 --> 15:07.839
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

15:07.840 --> 15:12.028
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,
a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

15:17.725 --> 15:19.494
Hm...

15:22.688 --> 15:25.333
Oh. Ooh.

15:25.442 --> 15:28.485
- Oh, hello. I'm looking for some...
- Sorry, no looking allowed.

15:28.486 --> 15:30.195
This store is for customers only.

15:30.196 --> 15:33.823
Okay, then, I would like to buy a
bicycle. What would you recommend?

15:33.824 --> 15:35.951
- One with a bell, or...?
- You got me.

15:35.952 --> 15:40.163
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

15:40.164 --> 15:44.960
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.

15:44.961 --> 15:46.962
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?

15:46.963 --> 15:48.797
And others.

15:48.798 --> 15:51.716
- I wanna say The Hobbi...
- Nope.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.176
Look. I'm an agent.

15:53.177 --> 15:55.363
It doesn't matter whether
I've read your work.

15:55.388 --> 15:59.475
What matters is I can look you in
the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

15:59.476 --> 16:02.478
The world is ready for your
comeback, and I wanna help.

16:02.479 --> 16:03.937
No, thank you. Not interested.

16:03.938 --> 16:05.814
Did that before, didn't work out well.

16:05.815 --> 16:07.983
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.

16:07.984 --> 16:11.361
And that's why my motto is,
"It's better to be alone."

16:11.362 --> 16:13.071
Which, come to think of it,

16:13.072 --> 16:15.740
is probably why I don't sell
a lot of tandem bicycles.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.661
But, J.D. Salinger,
you are J.D. Salinger.

16:18.662 --> 16:20.764
You are a goddamn American treasure.

16:20.788 --> 16:24.374
But every time I go out in the
world, people hound me about my books.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.042
Well, book.

16:26.043 --> 16:29.087
What if I told you there was a
place where no one reads books?

16:29.088 --> 16:30.339
I'm listening.

16:30.340 --> 16:33.509
A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.

16:33.510 --> 16:35.927
A place where people
hate reading so much,

16:35.928 --> 16:39.616
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.

16:39.641 --> 16:42.559
What do you mean, like,
modern reading slaves?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.852
Exactly.

16:43.853 --> 16:46.563
And all those modern reading
slaves really wanna be doing

16:46.564 --> 16:50.192
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.

16:50.193 --> 16:53.820
- Does such a place truly exist?
- Come with me, J.D. Salinger.

16:53.821 --> 16:55.715
Let's go to Hollywoo.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.264
Hup!

17:04.540 --> 17:07.602
Oh...

17:07.711 --> 17:09.002
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:09.002 --> 17:10.752
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

17:10.753 --> 17:13.923
You're probably wondering what
this beautiful mahogany box is.

17:13.924 --> 17:17.344
- I wasn't wondering that.
- It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

17:17.345 --> 17:19.823
I've decided to do
the funky Spider-Man.

17:19.847 --> 17:22.641
- What? Funky Spider-Man?
- I came up with that one myself.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.560
Because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.355
Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

17:28.356 --> 17:29.690
Yes. I do.

17:29.691 --> 17:31.316
Even though it's very dangerous

17:31.317 --> 17:33.002
- and I could die.
- Oh.

17:33.069 --> 17:36.279
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.575
- Okay. I get it.
- Since you don't, I should do it, right?

17:39.576 --> 17:42.578
I mean, there's no reason
not to... unless you love me.

17:42.579 --> 17:44.120
- Do it.
- Wait. Seriously?

17:44.121 --> 17:45.872
Seems like you've
already made up your mind.

17:45.873 --> 17:48.041
If you're that set on
it, knock yourself out.

17:48.042 --> 17:50.753
Only if I do it wrong.

17:50.754 --> 17:53.463
Because as I mentioned
before, it's very dangerous.

17:53.464 --> 17:55.882
- Have fun.
- I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

17:55.883 --> 17:59.278
Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.639
Morning time, Hollywoo.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.474
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

18:04.475 --> 18:07.911
And I'm An Actress Or Something, I
don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.

18:07.937 --> 18:10.606
- Whoa. What happened to her?
- She got kidnapped.

18:10.607 --> 18:12.124
Oh, boy.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.527
Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.821
Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.

18:18.822 --> 18:20.699
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.618
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.

18:22.619 --> 18:25.662
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

18:25.663 --> 18:29.082
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.376
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.754
- Not too late to stop me.
- I'm not gonna stop you.

18:33.755 --> 18:36.005
- Good 'cause don't.
- All right, we're in agreement.

18:36.006 --> 18:37.507
Stop fighting!

18:37.508 --> 18:39.676
Can't you two see what
this is doing to me?

18:39.677 --> 18:42.154
I've been acting out.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.574
Have a great day.

18:44.848 --> 18:46.308
Todd? Get in the car.

18:46.309 --> 18:49.269
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

18:49.270 --> 18:52.665
Hooray! Question mark?

18:55.901 --> 18:59.529
Just play it cool, Todd. No one
needs to know why we're here.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.907
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.

19:02.908 --> 19:06.829
Let's say something that could hoist
up a horse comfortably by the neck.

19:06.830 --> 19:09.289
Not for suicide purposes.

19:09.290 --> 19:12.101
I'm trying to have a
more fulfilling orgasm.

19:15.045 --> 19:18.841
The world wept when news
broke that J.D. Salinger died.

19:18.842 --> 19:22.820
- J.D. Salinger died?
- But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

19:22.886 --> 19:24.739
J.D. Salinger didn't die?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.808
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,

19:27.809 --> 19:30.853
J.D. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,

19:30.854 --> 19:33.146
eighth graders and
occasionally, assassins.

19:33.147 --> 19:36.274
His spare lyricism and
devotion to character

19:36.275 --> 19:40.069
will undoubtedly translate into a
penetrating dramatic work for this,

19:40.070 --> 19:42.322
the golden age of television writing.

19:42.323 --> 19:44.199
J.D. Take it away.

19:44.200 --> 19:48.662
I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.246
- What?
- Like a game show?

19:50.247 --> 19:52.666
Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,

19:52.667 --> 19:55.960
I think normal people would wanna
see if they know trivia and stuff.

19:55.961 --> 19:59.798
You know, like, Hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.966
Do they know things? Let's find out.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.637
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.656
What do you call it?

20:06.681 --> 20:10.141
I call it Hollywoo Stars
and What Do They Know?

20:10.142 --> 20:12.394
Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out.

20:12.395 --> 20:14.187
It's maybe more of a working title.

20:14.188 --> 20:16.064
I can see it on the marquee already.

20:16.065 --> 20:17.900
- Must be a long marquee.
- It's long.

20:17.901 --> 20:20.861
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.

20:20.862 --> 20:21.778
Oh, it's perfect.

20:21.779 --> 20:25.073
We've been searching for a companion
for Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

20:25.074 --> 20:27.551
But wait, wait one
second. Who's gonna host?

20:27.869 --> 20:30.579
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

20:30.580 --> 20:33.891
Who wants to be in Nike Airs?

20:34.083 --> 20:37.669
Claire, you are looking off the
charts "gorge" in those tennis shoes.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.524
Would you like to buy a towel?

20:41.758 --> 20:44.342
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.302
- He's perfect.
- Mm-hm.

20:46.303 --> 20:47.763
Mr. Peanutbutter?

20:47.764 --> 20:52.869
How would you like to be the host of
J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

20:52.894 --> 20:56.229
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.147
You know, it just goes to show,

20:58.148 --> 21:00.943
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams

21:00.944 --> 21:02.569
will always come true.

21:02.570 --> 21:04.279
And if your dreams don't come true,

21:04.280 --> 21:08.175
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

21:10.494 --> 21:15.039
Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.061
I'll give you two
hints: catcher and rye.

21:18.085 --> 21:20.002
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

21:20.003 --> 21:24.173
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye
bagel coming out of the toaster.

21:24.174 --> 21:27.218
- Come again?
- It was coming fast and hot.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.990
One day, some genius will
invent some sort of bagel catcher

21:31.014 --> 21:33.057
that takes the guesswork
out of this task,

21:33.058 --> 21:36.311
but until then, Charley
gets a gold star.

21:36.312 --> 21:40.708
- Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
- Oh...

21:44.904 --> 21:46.154
Oh, boy.

21:46.155 --> 21:47.990
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

21:47.991 --> 21:51.576
Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?

21:51.577 --> 21:53.244
Well, here I am, for now.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.956
BoJack... Wait. Did you fix the bed?

21:55.957 --> 21:57.624
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

21:57.625 --> 22:01.043
picking up supplies for my
auto-erotic asphyxiation machine.

22:01.044 --> 22:02.378
Because, as you are aware,

22:02.379 --> 22:05.632
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.

22:05.633 --> 22:09.636
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.

22:09.637 --> 22:11.554
Okay, BoJack.

22:11.555 --> 22:13.657
Wanna talk about the
elephant in the room?

22:13.724 --> 22:17.059
Wow. Okay. You know what?

22:17.060 --> 22:19.729
You know what? Here's... First of all...

22:19.730 --> 22:24.108
Wow. All right, I can't even...

22:24.109 --> 22:26.862
You know what? I...

22:26.863 --> 22:27.797
Wow.

22:27.905 --> 22:29.698
He is never gonna forget that.

22:29.699 --> 22:30.949
What is this all about?

22:30.950 --> 22:33.886
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

22:33.911 --> 22:36.162
that feels like a
rainbow with every color.

22:36.163 --> 22:37.831
- So, a regular rainbow.
- No.

22:37.832 --> 22:40.750
So, if you don't mind, as
long as you don't love me,

22:40.751 --> 22:43.169
I have a noose to step into.

22:43.170 --> 22:45.129
I just need to release this lever,

22:45.130 --> 22:47.632
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,

22:47.633 --> 22:50.134
and then just pull this nozzle.

22:50.135 --> 22:52.721
- Perfect.
- Okay. Have fun.

22:52.722 --> 22:56.993
- Wait, Wanda.
- Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

22:57.018 --> 22:58.368
I love you.

22:58.936 --> 23:01.771
I... I knew it.

23:01.772 --> 23:05.292
But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky Spider-Man.

23:05.317 --> 23:08.319
- What?
- You need to be responsible for yourself.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.196
- That doesn't sound like me.
- I know.

23:10.197 --> 23:13.199
But if you love me,
too, you won't do it.

23:17.663 --> 23:19.081
- I thought so.
- Okay.

23:19.082 --> 23:22.542
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,

23:22.543 --> 23:24.711
Me not doing it is not
a sign that I love you.

23:24.712 --> 23:26.963
- It's just because I'm a coward.
- Okay.

23:26.964 --> 23:28.673
- I don't love you.
- Sure, you don't.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.217
I don't. Come back
here. I don't love you.

23:31.218 --> 23:33.362
You don't make me feel less broken.

23:37.016 --> 23:37.974
I don't get it.

23:37.975 --> 23:42.603
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker
store employee a primetime show

23:42.605 --> 23:47.025
and resurrected a certified
dead man and nobody cared.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.837
- Why do I do anything?
- Hey.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.048
Do you need the movie star speech?

23:52.155 --> 23:54.032
Yeah.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.744
Okay. Carolyn, you are
the star of a movie.

23:57.745 --> 24:00.747
This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.

24:00.748 --> 24:03.708
Where the world tests you,
and people treat you like shit.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.376
But it has to happen this way.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.962
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

24:06.963 --> 24:10.172
when you get everything you
want, won't feel as rewarding.

24:10.173 --> 24:14.218
There are assholes out there,
but in the end, they don't matter.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.512
Because this movie's not about them.

24:16.513 --> 24:18.140
It's never been about them.

24:18.141 --> 24:21.869
All this time, the
movie's been about you.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.204
Thanks.

24:24.563 --> 24:27.565
- Carolyn?
- Yes, Rutabaga?

24:27.566 --> 24:30.961
I think Katie and I
are getting a divorce.

24:31.988 --> 24:34.697
Corduroy? I don't want
this thing anymore.

24:34.698 --> 24:36.449
Corduroy?

24:36.450 --> 24:37.742
Hey, you decent, man?

24:39.703 --> 24:41.430
Oh, sweet Jesus.

24:41.692 --> 24:47.293
