00:00.851 --> 00:02.150
Buckle up, girls.

00:02.227 --> 00:04.937
There's a sexy new singer in
town, and guess what.

00:05.021 --> 00:06.687
He just turned 13.

00:06.756 --> 00:09.657
His homemade music video
"I Wanna Marry U At Recess"

00:09.726 --> 00:13.061
has racked up 22 million views
in just three days.

00:13.129 --> 00:15.596
Some in the music industry
are already calling him

00:15.665 --> 00:17.498
<i>the next big white kid.</i>

00:17.567 --> 00:20.033
And that's why we are so
lucky to have him in the studio

00:20.102 --> 00:23.237
with us today for his first-ever
live TV interview.

00:23.305 --> 00:26.706
Please welcome ChaseDreams
and his mother Pat.

00:26.775 --> 00:27.841
- Hi, guys.
- Good to have you

00:27.910 --> 00:29.509
- with us today.
- Well, thank you so much

00:29.578 --> 00:31.444
- for having us.
- Well, of course.

00:31.513 --> 00:33.180
So walk us through this, okay?

00:33.249 --> 00:35.682
Did you always want to be a
famous singer?

00:35.751 --> 00:37.751
I actually never really sang before.

00:37.819 --> 00:39.586
I just made this one video for fun,

00:39.654 --> 00:41.355
and I guess lots of people liked it.

00:41.423 --> 00:43.156
- Yeah, they sure did.
- Sure did, yeah.

00:43.225 --> 00:45.458
So, Mom, does this kind of
talent run in the family?

00:45.527 --> 00:46.693
You have other kids, right?

00:46.762 --> 00:49.162
Yes, his older brother Cary
is an actor here

00:49.231 --> 00:50.364
in New York City.

00:50.432 --> 00:51.765
- He's really good.
- Oh, wow.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.434
What kind of work does he do?

00:54.503 --> 00:57.271
Hi, I'm Cary Dubek, and
I'm reading for the role

00:57.339 --> 01:00.507
of "Man At Party Who Smells Fart".

01:04.396 --> 01:05.950
Great party.

01:09.551 --> 01:11.317
- Thank you.
- Okay, great.

01:11.386 --> 01:12.719
Let's go again, but this time,

01:12.888 --> 01:16.423
I think the fart is just bigger
and better.

01:16.491 --> 01:17.924
Does that make sense?

01:17.992 --> 01:19.091
Yeah.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.528
So, Chase, you're only 13 years old.

01:21.596 --> 01:24.764
It's incredible to be so
talented at such a young age.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.132
Well, actually, Kathie Lee,

01:26.200 --> 01:27.734
that's kind of normal in our family.

01:27.803 --> 01:29.135
- Oh.
- My oldest, Brooke,

01:29.203 --> 01:30.870
was actually a professional dancer

01:30.939 --> 01:32.138
when she was Chase's age.

01:32.206 --> 01:33.139
That's big.

01:33.207 --> 01:34.441
So what's she doing now?

01:34.509 --> 01:36.175

02:26.225 --> 02:29.594
how did you come up with that
fantastic name ChaseDreams?

02:29.662 --> 02:31.161
- It's great.
- We love that.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.430

02:33.500 --> 02:35.199
on a decorative rock in my bathroom.

02:35.267 --> 02:36.634
Of course you do.

02:36.703 --> 02:38.435
But it also means, like,

02:38.505 --> 02:40.538
how it's important to chase dreams.

02:40.607 --> 02:42.172
- Wow.
- Wow, like, literally.

02:42.241 --> 02:44.308
My family taught me that,

02:44.377 --> 02:45.877
how you've got to live life to
the fullest,

02:45.945 --> 02:48.278
'cause you never know when it's
all gonna be over,

02:48.347 --> 02:51.516

Hey, Vishant, been here the whole time.

03:13.672 --> 03:15.271
I need to tell you something.

03:15.340 --> 03:19.108
Can you go get... the other one?

God, I'm already not into
whatever this is.

03:33.158 --> 03:34.991
- Yeah.
- Hi, Vishant.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.760
I wanted you both to know

03:36.828 --> 03:38.562
last night at my home

03:38.630 --> 03:41.531
my wife and I watched
"Brokeback Mountain".

03:41.600 --> 03:42.566
Uh-oh.

03:42.634 --> 03:44.267
I didn't like it.

03:44.335 --> 03:47.670
But I watched it.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.706
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.717
- Oh.
- Oh.

03:51.742 --> 03:52.675
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

03:52.743 --> 03:54.544
You are an ally.

03:54.612 --> 03:55.945
- We'll see you at Pride.
- Yes.

03:56.013 --> 03:57.413
- Thank you, Vishant.
- Wear that suit.

03:57.482 --> 03:59.515
We love that suit and those heavy shoes.

03:59.584 --> 04:01.384
Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm glad you're back.

04:01.453 --> 04:03.652
Because I have something
important to ask.

04:03.721 --> 04:06.289
- Will you marry me at recess?
- Oh, my God.

04:06.357 --> 04:08.491
For the record, I'm very happy for him.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.759
Mm-hmm, am I supposed to
believe that read.

04:10.828 --> 04:12.095
I'm very happy for him.

04:12.163 --> 04:13.829
- That's too big of a smile.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.898 --> 04:14.797
How was your audition?

04:14.865 --> 04:16.232
Oh, fine.

04:16.301 --> 04:18.367
I mean, I just... I wish...

04:18.435 --> 04:20.069
I wish I was auditioning for
cooler stuff by now.

04:20.137 --> 04:22.638
All right, first of all,
don't knock commercials, okay?

04:22.707 --> 04:25.475
I once dated a guy; he did one
Nasonex bee commercial.

04:25.543 --> 04:28.711
And after three dates, he
bought me this.

04:30.715 --> 04:33.281
Oh, I'm not wearing it right
now, but it's this big, ugly,

04:33.350 --> 04:34.483
disgusting ring, and I love it.

04:34.551 --> 04:36.351
Great. Well, what went wrong?

04:36.420 --> 04:38.854
Oh, he always had tiny little
balls of toilet paper

04:38.923 --> 04:39.855
stuck in his butt hole.

04:39.924 --> 04:41.490
Okay, that's...

04:41.558 --> 04:43.191
Oh, no one who works here, ma'am.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.775
We all have very clean butt holes.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.032

Brooke, what are you doing?

04:58.943 --> 05:01.176
I'm undercover.

05:01.245 --> 05:02.544
Employees aren't allowed to use the gym.

05:02.613 --> 05:05.014
They're also not allowed to
squat in empty apartments.

05:05.082 --> 05:07.215
I have to.

05:07.284 --> 05:09.084
- I broke up with Lance.
- Oh, no, not Lance.

05:09.153 --> 05:10.552
Lance was so hot.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.920
When he was 25, but now he's 30.

05:12.989 --> 05:14.989
And he still says, "Damn, Daniel".

05:15.058 --> 05:16.724
But isn't he, like, a shoe
designer or something now?

05:16.793 --> 05:18.660
- That's cool.
- No.

05:18.728 --> 05:21.829
No, he has ideas for shoes, and
then he draws them

05:21.898 --> 05:25.767
and then shows them to me, and
I'm like, "Maybe".

05:25.835 --> 05:28.069
And he's had the same day job
for six years.

05:28.138 --> 05:29.538
Bitch, so have we.

05:29.606 --> 05:32.374
Yeah, but starting today, I'm
gonna find my passion.

05:32.442 --> 05:35.076
I'm gonna...

05:35.145 --> 05:37.078
I'm gonna chase dreams.

05:37.147 --> 05:38.647
Oh.

05:38.715 --> 05:40.549
Oh, this is because of your brother.

05:40.617 --> 05:43.084
I mean, like, I can do
anything, you know?

05:43.153 --> 05:45.853
Like, the world is my oyster.

05:45.922 --> 05:49.090
Jo, I'm gonna try oysters.

05:49.159 --> 05:51.559
But this is because of a small child.

05:51.627 --> 05:54.228
I just want to make sure I'm clear.

05:54.297 --> 05:55.862
I've got to go to JFK.

05:55.931 --> 05:57.831
The new guy I started seeing
just landed.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.166
You're meeting him at the airport?

05:59.235 --> 06:02.903
Yeah, 'cause he's hot,
and he has a real job.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.771
I've got to get back out there.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.441
I have seen one dick in four years.

06:07.510 --> 06:11.378
This summer, I'm gonna see 50 dicks.

06:11.447 --> 06:14.147
- Ew.
- No.

06:14.217 --> 06:16.250
It's empowering.

06:16.319 --> 06:18.452
<i>Honey, are you sure you
can't come have lunch?</i>

06:18.521 --> 06:20.654
We're in Times Square at the Candy Bar.

06:20.723 --> 06:21.722
<i>No, I can't Mom.</i>

06:21.790 --> 06:23.624
I have that acting job, remember?

06:23.693 --> 06:24.891
<i>Ooh, that reminds me.</i>

06:24.960 --> 06:27.661
Chase just signed with a big,
fancy manager.

06:27.730 --> 06:28.762
<i>He did?</i>

06:28.831 --> 06:31.031
- Off of that one song?
<i>- Yep.</i>

06:31.100 --> 06:32.398
You know, at first I thought
maybe it was the same guy

06:32.467 --> 06:33.433
as your manager.

06:33.501 --> 06:34.801
No, mine's dead.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.037
Remember he killed himself in
Union Square?

06:37.106 --> 06:38.972
<i>Oh, yeah, how terrible.</i>

06:39.041 --> 06:40.907
Yeah, well, this one is
definitely alive,

06:40.976 --> 06:42.609
and when I asked, he said he
didn't know you,

06:42.677 --> 06:44.044
but you can meet him at dinner tonight.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.178
Okay, that sounds great.

06:45.247 --> 06:46.512
I have to go, Mom. I have work, okay?

06:46.581 --> 06:48.048
<i>Okay, and don't forget you and Brooke</i>

06:48.117 --> 06:49.382

hotel tonight, okay?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.751
Yes, that's great.

06:50.819 --> 06:52.152
- That sounds really good.
- <i>Kathie Lee paid for it...</i>

06:52.177 --> 06:53.163
- Oh, cool.
- My new best friend,

06:53.188 --> 06:54.487
mother of Cassidy and Cody.

06:54.556 --> 06:55.756
Yeah, I know who she is.

06:55.824 --> 06:57.523
We're two moms with a lot of
things in common.

06:57.592 --> 07:00.699
Yeah, you both have kids. Okay.

07:02.330 --> 07:06.266

building there.

07:06.334 --> 07:07.934

a burger or fries or, like, hot
dog or a taco...

08:26.476 --> 08:28.043
- No.
- Or burritos or ice cream

08:28.111 --> 08:29.077
or something like that.

08:29.145 --> 08:30.111
Yeah, I'm hungry for your pussy.

I'm the original dreamer.

08:47.598 --> 08:49.163

Oh, they said other people
are writing my next song.

08:54.071 --> 08:56.504
Well, anyway, our sincere
apologies to our girl

08:56.573 --> 08:59.107
Kerry Washington, 'cause we ended up
going along with Chase.

08:59.175 --> 09:01.842
- <i>So sorry, Kerry...</i>
- They bumped Kerry Washington?

09:01.911 --> 09:03.377
What is happening?

09:03.446 --> 09:05.613
- What's up, roomie?
- Oh, hey.

09:05.681 --> 09:07.215
You want me to start this over?

09:07.283 --> 09:10.585
"Survivor: Heroes versus Villains".

09:10.653 --> 09:12.653
That's okay; I've already seen this one,

09:12.722 --> 09:14.021
like, seven years ago.

09:14.090 --> 09:15.523
Best finale ever, right?

09:15.592 --> 09:18.558
Yeah, very good.

09:28.638 --> 09:30.938
I don't know how you still
watch this show.

09:31.007 --> 09:33.474
I mean, there's too many
close-ups of feet

09:33.543 --> 09:35.109
with bug bites.

09:35.177 --> 09:37.978
You're funny.

09:52.394 --> 09:54.261
Mmm.

09:54.329 --> 09:56.596
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Mmm.

09:56.666 --> 10:00.034
Oh, sorry, gotta run.

10:00.102 --> 10:02.102
Oh, that... no.

10:02.171 --> 10:05.505
I'll be back at JFK for 70
minutes on Thursday.

10:05.574 --> 10:07.440
- Oh.
- Maybe I can meet you

10:07.509 --> 10:08.942
at the baggage carousel bathroom

10:09.011 --> 10:10.711
and kiss you on the lips,

10:10.780 --> 10:12.546
your, uh, private lips.

10:12.614 --> 10:15.315
Bleh. Uh, listen, Jeff.

10:15.384 --> 10:18.017
As gorgeous as that just sounded,

10:18.086 --> 10:20.554
I think we should just move on,
you know.

10:20.622 --> 10:24.023
We're both busy, you with work,
and me with my quest

10:24.092 --> 10:26.326
to chase dreams.

10:26.395 --> 10:30.430
- Mm.
- But you are a great guy.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.699
And I'm sure you're an even
better pilot.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.301
I'm a flight attendant.

10:34.369 --> 10:35.335
What?

10:35.404 --> 10:36.403
Yeah, I'm not a pilot.

10:36.471 --> 10:38.171
I'm a flight attendant.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.839
Can I tell people that you were a pilot?

10:39.908 --> 10:41.174
What's wrong with being a
flight attendant?

10:41.243 --> 10:43.210
Nothing. It's just you're not gay.

10:43.278 --> 10:44.344
That's homophobic.

10:44.413 --> 10:46.179
No, it's not. I have a gay brother.

10:46.248 --> 10:48.448
Yeah, no dur. Everybody does.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.550
Hey, so this has been really,
really fun.

10:51.619 --> 10:52.651
Mm.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.919
You know how to see yourself out?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.321
Yeah, I just open the door,
and I walk out.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.879
Yeah.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.581
Okay.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.431
<i>♪ It's been a long time coming mommy ♪</i>

11:05.491 --> 11:06.636

11:17.911 --> 11:20.546
I think I'm gonna take a nap.

11:23.484 --> 11:25.250
Um, do you, uh,

11:25.318 --> 11:28.153
do you want me to lay with you or...

11:28.222 --> 11:29.687
Well, that might be weird.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.056
- Yeah.
- Since we're just roommates.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.924
- Yeah, no.
- And I'm straight, so...

11:32.993 --> 11:34.860
Yeah, yeah, you know, I know.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.594
But we're cool, right, dude?

11:36.663 --> 11:38.496
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, we're cool.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.631
We're cool, cool, cool, cool.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.199
Yeah, fo sho, fo sho.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.634
Yeah, all right, cool, cool.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.469
My playa.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.372
All right, um, I'm gonna take a nap too.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.241
I'm pretty tired.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.587
<i>God, I mean, maybe he is straight.</i>

12:37.656 --> 12:40.356
No, okay, he's initiating this stuff.

12:40.425 --> 12:42.792
Plus, I can feel his boner
through his shorts.

12:42.861 --> 12:45.728
Well, what kind of shorts?

12:45.797 --> 12:49.065
Red mesh basketball shorts.

12:49.134 --> 12:50.166
I'm sorry.

12:50.235 --> 12:52.969
Ugh, I mean, he does bring girls over

12:53.038 --> 12:56.439
to the place sometimes, and he
still watches "Survivor,"

12:56.507 --> 12:57.440
which is, like...

12:57.508 --> 12:58.641
Violently straight.

12:58.709 --> 12:59.745
But I don't know.

12:59.817 --> 13:03.279
I think he's bisexual,
because it's not 2010 anymore.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.614
Those people are real now. They exist.

13:05.683 --> 13:07.383
Yeah, I mean, I'm basically bisexual.

13:07.452 --> 13:08.384
No, you're not.

13:08.453 --> 13:10.253
You just dress up for Pride.

13:10.322 --> 13:11.987
Okay, whatever.

13:12.056 --> 13:16.892
Listen, Cary, hey, I love you,
but you've got to stop this.

13:16.961 --> 13:18.894
You need to try being in a real
relationship,

13:18.963 --> 13:20.495
like what me and Lance had.

13:20.564 --> 13:22.797
You and Lance didn't [bleep] for a year.

13:22.867 --> 13:25.901
That's just because he dabbed
all the time.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.002
Whatever.

13:27.071 --> 13:28.103
Tonight's all about ChaseDreams.

13:28.172 --> 13:31.907
I do not want to talk about...

13:31.976 --> 13:33.242
Lance?

13:33.310 --> 13:35.346
Hell yeah.

13:37.003 --> 13:39.323
Lance, what are you doing here?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.494
And why is your finger broken?

13:41.534 --> 13:43.809
Oh, turns out I can't do a backflip.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.113
Brookie, hi.

13:46.182 --> 13:47.281
Of course I invited Lance.

13:47.350 --> 13:48.549
He's your boyfriend.

13:48.618 --> 13:50.852
And my Care Bear.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.454
Mom, love the ensemble.

13:53.523 --> 13:56.757
Thank you. It's from the Candy Bar.

13:56.826 --> 13:58.257
No, I meant the jacket.

13:58.326 --> 14:00.360
Yeah, Candy Bar.

14:00.428 --> 14:01.394
Wow.

14:01.463 --> 14:02.996
So, guys, we're just right back here.

14:03.064 --> 14:06.867
Cary was kind enough to get us
the VIP table.

14:06.935 --> 14:09.803
So, Lance, are you still at Foot Locker?

14:09.872 --> 14:11.738
No, he's at Google now.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.240
Hey, hey, hey, these the sibs?

14:14.309 --> 14:15.441
I think so.

14:15.511 --> 14:18.244
This is Chase's new manager.

14:18.313 --> 14:19.245
Streeter.

14:19.314 --> 14:20.881
I've heard so much about you two.

14:20.949 --> 14:22.215
Whoo, I mean,

14:22.283 --> 14:24.183
but I promise you I will take
care of your little bro.

14:24.252 --> 14:25.184
Yeah, sure.

14:25.253 --> 14:26.452
He's a special dude.

14:26.522 --> 14:28.889
He's... he's talented, yet he's humble,

14:28.957 --> 14:32.458
also sexy, but he's a businessman.

14:32.528 --> 14:35.061
He's 13, but an icon.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.763
And girls are horny for him,
yet they respect him,

14:37.832 --> 14:38.998
and he respects them.

14:39.067 --> 14:40.833
He respects everyone.

14:40.902 --> 14:43.503
He is everything...

14:43.571 --> 14:46.305
to me.

14:46.374 --> 14:47.981
He's my best friend.

14:51.176 --> 14:54.013
Well, it's very nice to meet
all of what you are.

14:54.081 --> 14:56.448
Cary, Cary, come.

14:56.517 --> 14:59.484
Hey, Vishant, I'm actually...
I'm not working tonight.

14:59.554 --> 15:00.819
I just...

15:00.888 --> 15:04.523
I wanted you to know I saw
another gay film today.

15:04.592 --> 15:07.259
It had way more sex than
"Brokeback Mountain".

15:07.327 --> 15:09.294
But I think I liked it better.

15:09.363 --> 15:13.465
It was called "Cody Rides Tristan".

15:13.534 --> 15:15.805
I think that was a porn, Vishant.

15:17.004 --> 15:20.105
I just want to say thank you
all so very much

15:20.174 --> 15:22.640
for coming to celebrate Chase's big day.

15:22.709 --> 15:24.075
Wait. Where is Chase?

15:24.143 --> 15:26.377
Oh, yeah, that's my B.

15:26.546 --> 15:28.980
I biffed it right out of the gate.

15:29.049 --> 15:30.582
What happened?

15:30.650 --> 15:32.450
I just wanted to get his
little body jacked up

15:32.518 --> 15:34.452
for the Kids Choice Awards.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.956
He's presenting Best Kiss next
month with Meghan Trainor.

15:38.024 --> 15:38.957
- Ha.
- Yeah.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.024
- He is?
- Yeah.

15:40.093 --> 15:41.859
So I told him he can only have, like,

15:41.928 --> 15:45.830
a dozen raw eggs for lunch,
and he's lying on the floor

15:45.899 --> 15:47.298
back at the hotel room on a tarp.

15:47.366 --> 15:48.733
Damn, Daniel.

15:48.802 --> 15:50.267
- No.
- No, no.

15:50.336 --> 15:52.604
- No, no.
- That's done.

15:52.672 --> 15:55.573
But we can still celebrate my
children who are here.

15:55.642 --> 15:58.275
Because I'm equally proud
of both of you.

15:58.344 --> 16:02.045
To my Care Bear, who's working
so hard at becoming an actor.

16:02.115 --> 16:03.481
- Oh.
- I am an actor now, Mom.

16:03.549 --> 16:04.748
I'm... I'm acting.

16:04.817 --> 16:07.084
And Brookie, my little dancing queen.

16:07.153 --> 16:08.352
I haven't danced in 12 years.

16:08.421 --> 16:12.990
And Lance, America's next top
shoe designer.

16:13.058 --> 16:14.458
Thank you. You know what?

16:14.527 --> 16:16.293
I actually came up with three
new ideas for shoes today.

16:16.362 --> 16:18.496
One: laces on the bottom.

16:18.564 --> 16:20.731
Two: shoes but invisible.

16:20.799 --> 16:23.100
Three: edible shoes.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.068
Wait, I'm sorry, so you just
walk around in the shoes

16:25.138 --> 16:26.837
all day and then eat them?

16:26.905 --> 16:28.339
- Hell yeah if you're hungry.
- Oh, my God.

16:28.407 --> 16:29.840
I wish it was still okay to say
"retarded".

16:29.908 --> 16:33.676
Ho, no, wait, mamacita,
ChaseDream loves all people

16:33.745 --> 16:35.411
of all mental faculties.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.780
- Jesus Christ.
- Yes, even Jesus Christ.

16:37.849 --> 16:39.449
Oh, my God, Mom, I broke up with Lance.

16:39.518 --> 16:41.917
- What?
- Yes, two weeks ago.

16:41.986 --> 16:43.353
Oh, honey.

16:43.421 --> 16:45.555
- Are you doing okay?
- Yes, I'm great.

16:45.624 --> 16:47.257
I'm way better than I was before.

16:47.325 --> 16:49.025
- No offense, Lance.
- What?

16:49.093 --> 16:50.993
'Cause I finally get
to figure out what it is

16:51.062 --> 16:52.195
that I want to do with my life.

16:52.264 --> 16:54.997
I already decided that I'm
gonna see 50...

16:55.066 --> 16:56.098
- States.
- States.

16:56.168 --> 16:57.200
States.

16:57.269 --> 16:58.434
- I'm gonna travel.
- See 'em all.

16:58.503 --> 16:59.669
I'm gonna drive across the country.

16:59.737 --> 17:00.803
I'm gonna be a travel agent,
travel writer,

17:00.872 --> 17:03.439
travel photographer,
all the things, Mom...

17:03.508 --> 17:04.507
- More wine.
- Because, you know,

17:04.576 --> 17:06.809
I'm free to be me, which rhymed.

17:06.877 --> 17:09.712
I'm gonna be a rap, rap critic.

17:09.781 --> 17:11.814
The point is, Mom,
is that I'm rock solid.

17:11.883 --> 17:13.749
- We both are.
- Mm-hmm.

17:13.818 --> 17:16.185
Cary had a callback today.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.586
- Cary.
- Hey.

17:17.655 --> 17:19.521
Bravo.

17:19.589 --> 17:20.589
Go, Care.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.858
- Yay.
- It's really... it's nothing.

17:22.926 --> 17:28.164
It's just... it's a commercial
where I smell a fart.

17:28.232 --> 17:30.132
Yeah, I just... I just go, like...

17:35.707 --> 17:36.872
Oh, that was good.

17:36.941 --> 17:38.007
It was very natural.

17:38.076 --> 17:39.640
Full disclosure: I just
farted moments ago,

17:39.710 --> 17:40.875
so... it's the eggs.

17:40.944 --> 17:42.110
I do smell it now.

17:42.179 --> 17:44.879
Anyway, the point is, Mom,
we might not be the hot

17:44.948 --> 17:48.083
new twink or whatever,

17:48.151 --> 17:51.586
but all three of your kids are hot,

17:51.654 --> 17:53.454
equally successful millennials.

17:53.523 --> 17:54.655
What? You guys aren't millennials.

17:54.725 --> 17:55.924
- Yeah, we are.
- We Googled it.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.358
- We looked it up.
- It's 1982 and after.

17:57.427 --> 17:58.392
- So that's...
- Well, actually,

17:58.461 --> 18:00.394
Chance is Gen Z.

18:00.463 --> 18:02.030
- It's Chase.
- His name is Chase.

18:02.099 --> 18:03.698
Yeah, what did I say?

18:03.767 --> 18:05.600
Brookie, honey, listen to me.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.837
I don't care if any of you are
famous as long as you're happy.

18:08.905 --> 18:10.705
That's all that matters to me.

18:10.774 --> 18:12.740
Okay, both of you, come on,
come on right now.

18:12.808 --> 18:14.442
I want you to give me a hug.
Come around the table.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.743
- Mom.
- Right now.

18:15.811 --> 18:18.145
- Ugh.
- I love you both so much.

18:18.214 --> 18:21.716
But be careful of the studs,
'cause they're very sharp.

18:21.784 --> 18:23.851
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, Mom.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.986
Love you too.

18:26.055 --> 18:29.357
This hotel room is insane.

18:29.425 --> 18:31.659
Look at all this shit.

18:31.728 --> 18:36.130
These are all gifts from an
adult to a child.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.065
