17:27.350 --> 17:28.830
Hang on. Dante?

17:32.964 --> 17:35.445
Hey, what's in those things
anyway?

17:35.489 --> 17:38.274
Nobody knows for sure.

17:38.318 --> 17:43.975
Nobody wants to know. My guess,
trace amounts of brains.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.500
I'm good.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.850
It's an acquired taste.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.027
Let her go.

17:55.552 --> 17:58.729
Hey, shhhh. You're gonna get it.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.993
But I need you to calm down.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.517
You can do it.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.301
Shhhh.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.087
Shhhh. Yeah, that's it.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.829
There you are.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.963
Please?

18:21.317 --> 18:23.014
Those bizkits sure do the trick.

18:23.058 --> 18:23.885
Yeah.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.540
We'd be screwed without them.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.717
She must really be something,
that George.

18:30.283 --> 18:34.330
I've laid down my life for her.
Many times.

18:38.291 --> 18:44.035
Go on now. You're gonna be okay.
I promise.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.176
So, what do you think of this
Newmerica idea?

18:54.220 --> 18:56.570
Are you gonna vote yes?

18:58.049 --> 19:00.008
I hope she's right.

19:00.051 --> 19:04.665
I don't trust my fellow men.
But I trust her.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.320
She says we should be
one nation.

19:07.363 --> 19:10.192
I vote Newmerica.

19:10.236 --> 19:13.282
Yeah, well what's the
alternative?

19:13.935 --> 19:17.199
Burn it all down.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.564
These are some of the last
survivors out there.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.697
Yeah, looks like it.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.354
Warren! Murphy!

19:41.397 --> 19:43.573
Oh my God, Roberta!

19:44.835 --> 19:48.012
You are indestructible!
Look at your hair.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.058
Side effects, baby.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.799
I told you I'd find her.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.671
I shall never doubt you again.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.588
That red shit
ever gonna wear off?

19:58.632 --> 20:00.155
Stop it.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.027
Please refrain from touching
inductees until after quarantine

20:03.071 --> 20:04.507
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

20:04.551 --> 20:05.856
This is very impressive.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.683
Thank you.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.816
Yeah, they got room service?

20:10.121 --> 20:12.994
Oh. Welcome to Altura,

20:13.037 --> 20:17.172
the longest running zombie free
outpost in all of North America.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.827
You made it.
Give yourselves a hand.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.878
Okay, everybody. Listen up.
This is how it's gonna go.

20:27.922 --> 20:31.186
Humans line up to my right.
Mortally challenged to my life.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.796
Follow me.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.934
Where do you think you're going,
Lucifer?

20:39.977 --> 20:41.196
Lucifer?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.111
No, no, he ain't no demon.
He's our friend.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.201
Friend or not, he's going
straight to Biohazard Research.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.987
Excuse me? Who you calling
a bio hazard? Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:54.340 --> 20:56.820
I don't like
how this is trending.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.692
The cold and rugged terrain
have been a natural barrier.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.171
But since the Black Rain,

21:00.215 --> 21:02.957
there's been a steady increase
in zombie contacts.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.003
The Talkers are seeing it
on patrol everyday.

21:06.047 --> 21:09.485
Used to be one, two Z's a week.
Now it's two or three a day.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.792
The Black Rain could be
affecting their behavior,

21:11.835 --> 21:14.925
giving them a level of
consciousness like the Talkers.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.405
If you're right,

21:16.449 --> 21:18.929
some of the more remote outposts
could be in real danger.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.192
They're on their own
if this vote doesn't pass.

21:21.454 --> 21:24.152
We could all be in danger.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.023
He wouldn't wait.

21:26.067 --> 21:26.894
It's all right.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.852
Trouble at the gate.

21:28.896 --> 21:29.897
Zombies?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.115
Survivors.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.509
The ones we brought in.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.383
I'll take care of it.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.868
Get me the head of the Militia.

21:44.912 --> 21:49.220
Already on his way.

21:49.264 --> 21:53.181
Is there anything else I can
do for you in the meantime?

21:56.663 --> 21:57.794
You can't do this!

21:57.838 --> 22:00.449
This is discrimination
pure and simple!

22:00.493 --> 22:03.887
My friend here is a little
phobic. Of everything.

22:03.931 --> 22:04.714
Yeah.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.368
But especially scientists.

22:06.412 --> 22:07.326
That's right.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.937
It's not up to me.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.808
Either he goes to the lab
for examination

22:11.852 --> 22:13.636
or back to the Apocalypse.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.379
Hey, Doc. Doctor.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.077
What's up? Whoa.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.123
Hey, good. George, you're here.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.907
So look, this is Murphy.

22:23.951 --> 22:27.476
Okay? And despite what he
looks like, he's really human.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.392
And this is Lieutenant
Roberta Warren.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.090
She's the head of our band
of merry pranksters,

22:33.134 --> 22:35.223
aka Operation Bite Mark.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.573
She can vouch for Murphy too.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.575
You know, they shared blood
and everything.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.142
Those two go way back.
Just like all of us.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.970
Something wrong?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.329
Grenade!

22:59.334 --> 23:00.901
Let's go.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.121
Come on. Keep moving!

23:07.037 --> 23:07.864
Down!

23:09.823 --> 23:10.954
Stay close!

23:15.829 --> 23:17.874
Why aren't you at the evacuation
site?

23:18.658 --> 23:21.878
My friend was dying.
I couldn't leave her.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.576
Did you mercy her?

23:24.141 --> 23:27.231
I didn't know how.
She turned and I ran.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.887
Okay. I'm Lieutenant Roberta
Warren. What's your name?

23:31.975 --> 23:34.064
Sweetheart, what's your name?

23:34.108 --> 23:35.544
Georgia St. Claire.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.939
Okay, Georgia. We got two
minutes to get to that evac.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.680
You with me?

23:41.332 --> 23:42.029
Huh?

23:49.732 --> 23:50.559
Come on!

23:52.126 --> 23:53.519
In the head!

24:00.047 --> 24:02.484
Now that's how
you do it!

24:03.703 --> 24:05.444
Have mercy.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.402
Georgia?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.840
Hey, hey, hey.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.756
You okay? Look at me.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.584
Look at me.

24:15.628 --> 24:19.414
You're okay. All right.
Let's go.

24:20.023 --> 24:20.937
Those your people?

24:22.809 --> 24:24.114
That's them.

24:26.813 --> 24:27.944
There's so many.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.599
I know. But there's no time
to go around.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.819
We're going to have to just run
right through them. Okay?

24:32.862 --> 24:35.474
Yes, we are. You're gonna
take this, flip it up,

24:35.517 --> 24:36.866
use it like an axe.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.697
Come on, I got you.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.004
Puppies and
kittens. Puppies and kittens.

24:44.047 --> 24:44.613
Puppies and kittens.

24:44.657 --> 24:45.875
What, you praying?

24:47.529 --> 24:50.053
No, puppies and kittens is what
I call zombies so I'm not scared

24:50.097 --> 24:51.054
Puppies and kittens.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.578
All right, stay close.

24:52.621 --> 24:56.451
Take that down. All right?
We're running on three.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.106
One, two, three. Stay low.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.030
Come on! Come on!

25:10.073 --> 25:12.119
Puppies and... Shit!

25:16.340 --> 25:17.124
Get down!

25:19.996 --> 25:20.867
Come on.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.347
I'm out! I'm out!

25:23.391 --> 25:25.698
This way. Hurry. Hurry in.
This way.

25:28.439 --> 25:29.789
You're good.

25:36.056 --> 25:40.626
All right. Watch out for those
puppies and kittens. Let's go!

25:52.986 --> 25:54.640
I told you you'd be okay.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.816
Now wait.
You two know each other?

25:56.859 --> 25:58.774
She saved my life.She saved my life.

25:59.035 --> 26:02.691
Well great. So that means
I can skip the testing?

26:03.213 --> 26:04.475
No.

26:21.667 --> 26:31.633
♪

26:32.895 --> 26:34.810
This is quite an operation.

26:35.202 --> 26:38.422
We've been working
on a constitution for weeks.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.468
It's not even done yet.

26:40.511 --> 26:42.383
It probably never will be done.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.037
We're voting on it anyways.

26:44.733 --> 26:45.778
Can't wait.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.868
Hey, who's that?

26:48.911 --> 26:51.610
That is Roman Estes.
The CEO of Altura.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.525
He was one of the first people
to settle here in the valley.

26:54.569 --> 26:57.006
He's the reason
we have water and power.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.269
Not a mad genius.

26:59.313 --> 27:03.709
He's a genius, but he's totally
cool. I will introduce you.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.362
Of course.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.062
Excuse me, Roman?
You got a minute?

27:09.584 --> 27:11.064
There's someone
I want you to meet.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.456
Of course.

27:12.761 --> 27:15.198
This is Roberta Warren,
an old friend.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.723
She saved my life
back in Black Summer.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.159
It's a pleasure.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.291
We owe you a debt of gratitude
for saving George here.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.554
She's one of our
greatest resources.

27:23.598 --> 27:26.253
Well, did she tell you
she saved my life too?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.907
Not surprised.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.518
It's kind of a habit
with George.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.389
Welcome to Altura.

27:32.433 --> 27:35.697
Or if George has anything to say
about it, soon to be Newmerica.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.659
So you were in Zona?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.487
In the beginning, yeah.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.316
And you left?

27:47.361 --> 27:49.842
I didn't support their goals.

27:49.885 --> 27:53.410
Luckily, I got out early.
When were you there?

27:53.454 --> 27:55.935
I got out early as well.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.812
When they said they were sending
me some type of red freak,

28:03.856 --> 28:05.118
I should've known it was you.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.075
Listen, Sun Beam.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.120
Sun Mei.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.382
Whatever.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.340
Don't you think that
my precious bodily fluids

28:10.384 --> 28:13.039
have caused enough trouble
for one Apocalypse?

28:13.082 --> 28:14.605
Your blood's such a toxic stew

28:14.649 --> 28:17.391
that I doubt there's much
scientific value for my work.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.698
Christ,
not another vaccine.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.612
Actually, no.

28:21.656 --> 28:24.354
I'm trying to identify and
synthesize the protein in brains

28:24.398 --> 28:25.965
that make Talkers human.

28:26.008 --> 28:29.490
Oh, is that right? Well yeah,
you're god's work there, sister.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.492
Hey, listen.
What happened to you anyway?

28:31.535 --> 28:33.886
I mean, we all thought you died.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.979
I got rescued
by a group of Marines,

28:40.022 --> 28:42.285
including Lieutenant Dante,

28:42.329 --> 28:46.246
before he died and turned
into one of the first Talkers.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.465
Marjorie here
is married to Dante.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.771
They make such a cute couple.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.294
Quiet, blabber mouth.

28:51.338 --> 28:56.038
Oh, is that right? So it's true,
love never dies.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.300
It just rots away.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.521
Citizen Z here,

29:00.564 --> 29:02.828
coming to you live
from The Pale Horseman Tavern.

29:02.871 --> 29:05.395
The place where future
Newmericans come to, well,

29:05.439 --> 29:07.963
they come here to get drunk
and forget about zombies.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.879
But today we're here to argue
over a new constitution.

29:10.923 --> 29:13.099
Humans, Talkers,
all soon to be citizens

29:13.142 --> 29:16.493
ready to embark on this crazy
experiment in democracy.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.322
Holy zombie. Doc?

29:19.845 --> 29:20.976
10K?

29:21.020 --> 29:21.847
What's up, man?!

29:21.890 --> 29:22.761
Hey!

29:22.804 --> 29:24.327
I thought I heard your voice.

29:24.371 --> 29:28.767
It's so good to see you. And you
I don't know, but come here.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.811
Welcome!

29:29.855 --> 29:31.204
So, how's...
how's Kaya and the baby?

29:31.247 --> 29:33.380
Oh man, they're
great. They're back at Pacifica.

29:33.423 --> 29:35.469
Warren's here somewhere.
She's with that gal George.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.818
Yeah? I love George.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.733
George is a big reason
why all this is happening.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.821
Yeah, she seemed cool.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.605
How bout this?
You guys go take a seat,

29:41.649 --> 29:42.824
and I'll finish up here
and join you.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.217
Right on. Good to see you,
buddy.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.697
Oh it's so good to see you.
Welcome.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.135
Come here.

29:51.267 --> 29:54.967
That was so so cool. Operation
Bite Mark in the house!

29:55.010 --> 29:59.841
Look at you.
All grown up.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.538
Yeah, you sure have changed.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.279
Well the zombies will do that
to you.

30:03.323 --> 30:05.847
Indeed.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.458
You look exactly
like I remember you.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.460
Well, I appreciate
your glaucoma.

30:10.504 --> 30:11.374
One zombie shine.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.201
Thank you.

30:12.245 --> 30:13.246
And one water.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.029
Thank you.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.078
Black Summer.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.731
Black Summer.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.085
And now we're here.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.653
Now we're here.

30:29.697 --> 30:32.178
It looks like you've made a name
for yourself.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.788
Hardly.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.877
No, I heard that most of the
students you started out with

30:35.921 --> 30:38.488
in Black Summer made it
here because of you.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.100
It was Lieutenant Dante
and the other Talkers.

30:41.143 --> 30:45.408
Really. If it weren't for their
help, we'd be dead or worse.

30:45.452 --> 30:48.063
At least you knew
to ask for help.

30:48.107 --> 30:52.285
You know, you were the one
that knew they still had souls.

30:52.328 --> 30:57.812
Back then when we saved each
other, I knew you were special.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.037
It's been really hard.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.519
I know.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.746
So, what have you been up to
since Black Summer?

31:18.789 --> 31:19.965
Well...

31:23.185 --> 31:24.273
Got it.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.282
Hello, Dante.

31:33.543 --> 31:37.504
Hello, Pandora. Now go away.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.419
Don't be so mean.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.555
Well I came here
to congratulate you.

31:45.599 --> 31:48.558
I hear it's gonna be a landslide
for the yes votes.

31:48.602 --> 31:52.736
Your human is gonna get
everything she wants.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.086
And more.

31:54.477 --> 31:58.917
She's not my human.
Her name is George.

31:58.960 --> 32:03.878
And since when do you give a
bizkit what the humans want.

32:03.922 --> 32:10.406
Oh Dante, you don't have to be
so...living.

32:17.674 --> 32:21.548
Just because you can't get
everything you want.

32:22.549 --> 32:23.724
Pity.

32:34.474 --> 32:37.651
Citizen Z! Wow man! I love you.

32:37.694 --> 32:38.869
Oh, thank you.

32:38.913 --> 32:42.090
Man, when I was out in the shit,

32:42.134 --> 32:45.093
your broadcasts were the only
thing that kept me going.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.138
Thanks, man.
That makes me feel good.

32:46.181 --> 32:47.269
I am buying you drink.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.096
No, no, no, I already have one.

32:48.140 --> 32:48.923
Get this man a real drink.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.185
No, I don't deserve a drink.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.926
You know brother,
I have to work tomorrow.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.885
That's not a drink.
Here's a drink.

32:54.929 --> 32:55.843
Thank you.

32:56.191 --> 32:57.801
Is that a thumb?

32:57.845 --> 32:59.803
You're supposed to eat it
when you get to the bottom

32:59.847 --> 33:00.717
like the worm in tequila.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.241
Oh, right.

33:02.284 --> 33:05.026
Don't worry.
The alcohol kills the germs.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.028
Okay.
Well that's good to know.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.291
No, it's delicious,
surprisingly.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.597
I can't believe it.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.034
The real Citizen Z.

33:13.078 --> 33:13.600
Hi.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.907
Looks like Citizen Z is having
a little Talker Stalker moment.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.518
Why don't you go rescue him,
kid?

33:18.561 --> 33:19.649
Sure.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.697
Who's gonna tell 10K about Red?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.133
Not me. You gotta tell him.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.917
Why should I be
the bearer of bad news?

33:26.961 --> 33:29.311
Because you're cuddly
and everybody likes you.

33:29.355 --> 33:32.271
Break it to him gentle.
Sensitive.

33:32.619 --> 33:35.709
Yeah, I got this. It's cool.
I'll be cool. I got it.

33:35.752 --> 33:39.191
When I was alive, I used to
listen to you on the short wave.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.584
Oh, thank you. That means a lot
to me. Thank you.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.151
Oh hey, there's my buddy.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.718
Where have you been? I've been
looking all over for you.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.373
Uh, well guys, it's been so nice
to meet you. Thank you so...

33:47.416 --> 33:48.896
Thank you so much.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.071
Thank you.

33:51.681 --> 33:52.682
What was that?

33:52.726 --> 33:53.814
What was what?

33:55.207 --> 33:58.123
Do not let me drink this.
I got a wife and kid.

34:10.787 --> 34:14.139
Red's alive! She's here with
another dude and they got a kid!

34:20.536 --> 34:22.625
Another dude?

34:25.802 --> 34:27.978
And they have a kid?

34:28.022 --> 34:30.068
Sorry, Tommy.

34:37.249 --> 34:40.078
Oh, don't drink the thumb.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.912
Just take it easy.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.785
Get your hands off me,
you damn dirty Talker.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.701
Uh oh, looks like trouble
in paradise.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.746
People like you give
humans a bad name.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.662
I've never trusted your kind,
and I never will.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.883
Yeah, well you're gonna be one
of my kind in a minute

35:02.926 --> 35:04.319
if you don't shut up!

35:04.363 --> 35:06.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Leroy, Cliff,

35:06.191 --> 35:08.454
you guys are drunk.
Be cool. All right?

35:08.497 --> 35:09.803
We're all friends here.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.284
Yeah, you better listen to her.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.851
I think we've listened to her
too much.

35:14.895 --> 35:18.594
You're always siding with them
over your own kind.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.118
We have rights too.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.859
We all have rights.
Inalienable rights.

35:22.903 --> 35:26.428
Life, liberty, the pursuit of
getting shitfaced drunk.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.214
You think this is a joke?

35:30.215 --> 35:33.653
These Talkers aren't human.
They're zombies.

35:33.957 --> 35:38.005
And some day they're gonna stop
pretending and start eating us.

35:38.048 --> 35:42.749
Sit down and shut up!
You're drunk.

35:42.792 --> 35:47.667
You can't speak to me that way,
you bag of rotting jerky.

35:52.411 --> 35:53.412
Hey!

35:55.240 --> 35:57.503
You shot me.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.682
I'll do it again if
you don't shut up.

36:02.725 --> 36:05.511
Oooh, this is gonna take
some getting used to.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.556
This was my favorite t-shirt.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.867
Your wife was a Talker,
wasn't she?

36:15.956 --> 36:18.219
I miss here everyday.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.221
And if she were still here,

36:20.265 --> 36:23.355
how do you think she would vote
tomorrow?

36:23.398 --> 36:26.140
I think she would vote yes

36:26.184 --> 36:29.796
because she loves you.
She'd want to be with you.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.363
Just like all these
post-dead folks

36:31.406 --> 36:34.192
want to be with their loved
ones. That's all they're asking.

36:38.283 --> 36:41.590
You'll get the bullets back
when you sober up.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.468
A toast!

36:51.470 --> 36:52.471
To democracy!

36:52.906 --> 36:54.647
To democracy!

37:05.788 --> 37:08.226
Ballots are still being
cast in each of the outposts,

37:08.269 --> 37:10.097
as the constitutional delegates
gather here

37:10.140 --> 37:12.578
awaiting the outcome
of the vote.

37:12.621 --> 37:15.407
Mr. Estes
Did you vote?

37:15.972 --> 37:18.932
We did. In just a few minutes
the polls will close

37:18.975 --> 37:20.281
and the voters will have spoken.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.588
Amazing. How do you feel?

37:22.631 --> 37:26.287
I feel good. Like we made it
to the end of a long journey.

37:26.331 --> 37:27.854
A part of me is also sad,
though,

37:27.897 --> 37:31.074
thinking of the people that
didn't make it here to see this.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.207
Oh, Leroy.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.428
I know we don't agree
on much of anything,

37:36.471 --> 37:38.908
but I'm glad you came out
to vote.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.302
Actually, I voted yes.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.869
You were right.

37:43.391 --> 37:46.133
It's how Anna would have voted.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.266
Good luck with your country.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.139
If you can keep it.

37:52.182 --> 37:56.274
Thank you. And we're keeping it,
if it kills me.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.363
How's that speech coming?

37:58.624 --> 38:01.714
Oh, umm, I got it right here.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.324
Just need to work
on the opening.

38:03.368 --> 38:07.546
You better hurry up. Polls
are closing any second. And...

38:08.242 --> 38:14.074
In three, two, one. The polls
are officially closed!

38:25.390 --> 38:28.958
What happens if the no votes
win

38:29.002 --> 38:30.525
And what are they gonna do
with the Talkers

38:30.569 --> 38:32.919
if they're not even citizens?
It seems like it won't be long

38:32.962 --> 38:35.182
until there's more of them
than us.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.881
Are you even listening to me?

38:45.410 --> 38:47.150
You should go talk to her.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.238
What?

38:48.717 --> 38:50.763
You should go talk to her.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.598
Nervous?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.384
About the vote? No.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.735
The speech? Little bit.

39:49.778 --> 39:51.389
Just speak your truth.

39:51.867 --> 39:55.349
Newmerica's real.
That's my truth.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.003
Then what?

39:58.526 --> 40:01.529
We'll roll up our sleeves
and get shit done.

40:01.573 --> 40:04.663
It's 1776 all over again.

40:25.553 --> 40:28.469
Your friend Sarge
told me you were here.

40:32.908 --> 40:35.215
I'm so happy you're alive.

40:35.258 --> 40:37.173
Me too.

40:37.217 --> 40:42.744
Not me, you.
I'm happy you're alive too.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.624
Let's try this again.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.454
You're alive.

40:58.543 --> 41:02.024
Tommy. You're alive.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.852
You're alive.

41:03.896 --> 41:07.682
I was so afraid that
I would never see you again.

41:09.292 --> 41:11.512
What about the other dude?

41:11.556 --> 41:12.861
Other dude?

41:12.905 --> 41:15.255
The father of your child?

41:16.474 --> 41:17.823
My...child?

41:20.826 --> 41:24.264
Tommy,
there's no other dude.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.397
There's not?

41:28.486 --> 41:30.792
You must mean Ted.

41:31.314 --> 41:34.796
He's married to a friend
of mine. It's her kid.

41:36.363 --> 41:37.756
Oh.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.500
Can we try this again?

41:48.984 --> 41:51.334
It's been a long journey
getting here.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.728
And we'll get to the results
in just a moment.

41:53.772 --> 41:55.904
I want to thank one person
in particular

41:55.948 --> 41:59.691
who has worked tirelessly
to get us to this point.

41:59.734 --> 42:02.432
And if anyone
has earned the right

42:02.476 --> 42:06.262
to announce the final results
of the vote, it's her.

42:06.306 --> 42:08.090
So George?

42:09.048 --> 42:13.269
Let's get her up here. George!
George! George! George!

42:13.313 --> 42:15.837
George! George!
George! George!

42:15.881 --> 42:16.577
Where is she?

42:16.621 --> 42:17.230
George!

42:18.144 --> 42:20.059
George! George! George! George!

42:20.102 --> 42:22.801
Hey. They're calling your name.

42:22.844 --> 42:25.499
I need a joke. You got to start
a speech with a joke, right?

42:25.543 --> 42:28.676
George! George! George!
George! George!

42:28.720 --> 42:31.505
Hey. Don't forget the results.

42:31.766 --> 42:32.724
Right.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.813
George! George! George! George!

42:35.074 --> 42:37.642
George! George! George! George!

42:37.903 --> 42:41.341
George! George! George! George!

42:41.384 --> 42:42.603
George! George!

42:42.647 --> 42:43.169
George!

42:43.212 --> 42:44.300
Wish me luck.
