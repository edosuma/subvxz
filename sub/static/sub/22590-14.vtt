00:10.261 --> 00:12.472
<i>NARRATOR".
Noon in Gotham City.</i>

00:12.639 --> 00:17.101
<i>While millions of workers hurry
to their midday meal...</i>

00:17.268 --> 00:22.815
<i>...at</i> a <i>posh private luncheon, the city's
10 best-dressed women are being named...</i>

00:22.982 --> 00:27.987
<i>...by the town's top couturier,
Rudi Gernreich.</i>

00:28.947 --> 00:32.992
And finally,
number 10 is Mrs. Blanche Turer...

00:33.159 --> 00:38.122
...who popularized the mini-muumuu
for evening wear.

00:39.874 --> 00:44.671
As an extra added fillip, ladies,
I have created a new designation.

00:44.837 --> 00:48.174
For the best-dressed crime-fightress
in Gotham City...

00:48.341 --> 00:53.221
...the first annual Batty
is hereby presented to Batgirl.

00:57.308 --> 01:03.648
To accept the award for Batgirl
are Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara.

01:06.192 --> 01:09.320
On behalf of Batgirl, Mayor Linseed,
Chief O'Hara...

01:09.487 --> 01:13.408
...the entire Gotham City Police Force
and myself, thank you, Mr. Gernreich.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.245
This award just goes to prove
that there is room for style...

01:17.412 --> 01:18.538
...even in crime-fighting.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.791
- Ridiculous.
- It's Catwoman.

01:21.958 --> 01:24.794
I said, ridiculous. Nonsense. Foolish prattle.

01:24.961 --> 01:28.006
How can Batgirl be the best anything
when Catwoman is around?

01:29.465 --> 01:34.596
No best-dressed list is complete
without the addition of the queen of criminals...

01:34.762 --> 01:38.474
...the Princess of Plunder, yours untruly.

01:38.641 --> 01:39.809
Right, Manx and Angora?

01:39.976 --> 01:41.019
Right.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.732
In any comparison
between Batgirl and myself...

01:45.898 --> 01:47.859
...she runs a poor third.

01:48.318 --> 01:49.402
Just a minute, Catwoman.

01:49.569 --> 01:52.030
You can't come here
and disrupt a luncheon like this.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.531
Or my awards.

01:53.698 --> 01:56.701
Ah, but I can, gentlemen.

01:56.868 --> 01:59.037
And I have.

01:59.495 --> 02:03.958
You ladies with your fancy hairdos,
what do you know about beauty?

02:04.125 --> 02:07.545
After you suffer the effects
of my hair-raising bomb...

02:07.879 --> 02:10.923
...you will never be able
to raise your heads in public again.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.968
Then we'll see who's the fairest of them all.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.137
No, not our hair. Anything but that.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:28.650 --> 02:30.485
I read your mind, commissioner.

02:30.652 --> 02:32.945
- To the Batphone.
-Right.

03:19.075 --> 03:21.285
<i>NARRATOR".
In a fashionable midtown men's shop...</i>

03:21.452 --> 03:25.289
<i>...Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson
scan the new styles.</i>

03:25.456 --> 03:29.085
Gosh, Bruce, my first tux shirt
for the first school prom.

03:29.252 --> 03:32.755
- I don't know how to tie a bow tie.
-I wouldn't be too concerned about that.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.800
Alfred and I will give you the benefit
of our vast years of experience.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.427
How do you like this one here? it's--

03:40.138 --> 03:42.849
Commissioner Gordon's trying
to get to us on the Batphone.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.643
- We'd better get home.
-No, there's no time for that.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.479
We'll change into our spare Batoutfits
in the limousine...

03:48.646 --> 03:52.525
...and leg it to police headquarters.
-Leg it? How about a taxi?

03:52.692 --> 03:57.822
Arriving at Commissioner Gordon's office
in a taxi might be deemed a trifle ostentatious.

03:57.989 --> 03:59.866
But that's three miles from here.

04:00.032 --> 04:03.119
A sound mind in a sound body.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.701
Thank you, citizen.

04:44.202 --> 04:46.037
Batrun.

04:58.883 --> 05:01.093
Ruined their hair forever?

05:01.260 --> 05:03.721
Catwoman really knows
a woman's weak spot.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.265
Her last words were something about
her intending...

05:06.432 --> 05:08.768
...to become the best-dressed woman
in Gotham City.

05:08.935 --> 05:09.977
A noble ambition.

05:10.144 --> 05:13.523
The problem is, how do we catch her
before she creates further havoc?

05:13.898 --> 05:16.734
Just as you'd set a thief to catch a thief...

05:16.901 --> 05:20.321
...you might be able to capture Catwoman
by using Batgirl as the bait.

05:20.488 --> 05:24.075
Never. Oh, I'm sorry to be so abrupt,
Miss Gordon.

05:24.242 --> 05:27.161
But I wouldn't dream
of endangering that fair lady's head.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.248
No, you'd better leave the crime-fighting
to the men.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.584
Commissioner, Chief O'Hara,
we'll let you know if we get any clues.

05:33.835 --> 05:35.545
Let's go, Robin.

05:36.921 --> 05:41.509
<i>NARRATOR". And in an abandoned loft
in the heart of Gotham City's garment center...</i>

05:41.676 --> 05:44.971
<i>Catwoman is fashioning
her criminal conspiracy...</i>

05:45.137 --> 05:50.935
<i>...while her admiring henchmen,
Angora and Manx, look on.</i>

06:02.405 --> 06:06.325
I'm pleased to say
everything is going exactly as scheduled.

06:06.492 --> 06:09.871
Batgirl is the perfect mouse for my Cat-trap.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.875
- Well, you have to catch her first.
-Oh, we'll catch her, all right.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.128
And as soon as the Troublesome Trio
is eliminated...

06:17.295 --> 06:19.839
...we can steal the Golden Fleece.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.507
The Golden what?

06:21.674 --> 06:23.009
The Golden Fleece.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.971
It is the single most valuable
piece of clothing in creation.

06:27.138 --> 06:30.892
A million dollars' worth
of 24-karat gold cloth.

06:31.058 --> 06:36.606
All woven into one gorgeous garment,
belonging to Queen Bess of Belgravia.

06:36.772 --> 06:42.653
I managed to purloin this picture of it today
at the couturier's luncheon...

06:42.820 --> 06:44.906
...heh, heh, when no one was looking.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.994
I glow at the thought of that garment.

06:50.161 --> 06:52.580
Well, how much can we get for it
on the open market?

06:52.747 --> 06:54.957
There is no open market for it.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.459
Then what good is it?

06:57.835 --> 07:00.421
We sell it back to Queen Bess.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.466
It's a national Belgravian treasure.

07:03.925 --> 07:06.218
Her country will pay anything for it.

07:08.930 --> 07:11.098
She's due to arrive here today...

07:11.265 --> 07:14.602
...for a series of private audiences
in Gotham City.

07:14.769 --> 07:20.358
If she returns to Belgravia without it,
her people will be up in arms.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.526
In other words...

07:22.693 --> 07:26.072
...we are in the catbird seat.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.324
Manx...

07:29.784 --> 07:31.160
...take a telegram.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.998
"The annual fashion show,
also run by Rudi Gernreich...

07:36.165 --> 07:40.544
...in <i>the showroom</i>
of <i>Fashionation Magazine.</i>

07:40.962 --> 07:43.673
And I'm gonna get away with it."
Signed, "Catwoman."

07:43.839 --> 07:45.132
That's the message, Batman.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.219
What an enormous ego she has,
telling us her plan.

07:48.386 --> 07:49.553
What do we do, Batman?

07:50.054 --> 07:51.806
Let us handle it, commissioner.

07:51.973 --> 07:54.892
And if you should hear from Batgirl, don't--

07:55.059 --> 07:58.688
Repeat, don't tell her
about this turn of events here.

07:58.854 --> 08:03.985
Your daughter, Barbara, may have been correct
when she said this might be a trap for Batgirl.

08:04.402 --> 08:07.571
Right. I won't tell Batgirl a thing.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.573
Won't tell Batgirl what, Daddy?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.369
Hmm, well...

08:13.536 --> 08:16.872
...I guess I can tell you.
After all, you're not Batgirl.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.713
<i>NARRATOR". Having learned of Catwoman's
plan from Commissioner Gordon...</i>

08:23.879 --> 08:28.342
<i>...Barbara Gordon dons her guise as Batgirl...</i>

08:28.509 --> 08:32.679
<i>...best-dressed crime-fightress in America.</i>

08:36.058 --> 08:39.311
<i>While Batgirl hurries
to her fateful appointment...</i>

08:40.145 --> 08:44.025
<i>...Batman approaches from another direction.</i>

08:45.735 --> 08:48.404
In <i>the</i> showroom
<i>of</i> Fashionation Magazine...

08:48.571 --> 08:53.242
<i>...Rudi Gernreich again regales the assemblage
with his droll comments.</i>

08:53.409 --> 08:57.455
For the rest of this year at least,
the fashionable woman...

08:57.621 --> 08:59.874
...will be wearing less than ever before.

09:00.458 --> 09:04.545
There is a continuing trend towards
mini-dresses...

09:04.712 --> 09:07.798
...mini-gloves and even mini-shoes.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.258
Mini-haha.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.972
If you'll all remain calm, no one will get hurt.

09:15.139 --> 09:16.974
Just why are you doing this?

09:17.141 --> 09:19.185
These are all one-of-a-kind clothes, Rudi.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.562
I intend to add them to my wardrobe.

09:21.729 --> 09:25.816
Let no one say that Catwoman
is not the best-dressed woman in the world.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.110
There are no fashion shows
where you're going.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.988
And how could a feline feloness like you
also be a fashion model?

09:31.155 --> 09:32.323
Ah, ah.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.825
Credit where credit is due, Robin.
She may be evil...

09:35.409 --> 09:38.996
...but she is attractive. You'll know more
about that in a couple of years.

09:39.163 --> 09:42.750
Now, are you coming quietly, Catwoman,
or must we use force?

09:43.167 --> 09:47.046
Your silver-tongued oratorio
has convinced me, Batman.

09:47.213 --> 09:51.842
I hereby remit myself
to your muscular custody.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.512
Don't try to pull the wool over our eye slits.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.264
Tsk. Now, would I do a thing like that?

10:05.189 --> 10:08.359
You cats slip back to the hideout.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.906
There's only one ingredient missing
in this stew: Batgirl.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.991
Look again, Catwoman.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.747
How did you find out about this?

10:21.914 --> 10:24.834
I specifically asked Commissioner Gordon
not to involve you.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.794
We can fight our own battles.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.132
Catwoman's going into
the models' dressing room.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.259
- Aah!
- Shh!

10:33.425 --> 10:34.510
Clam up.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.805
If the Dynamic Drips react
the way I expect them to react...

10:37.972 --> 10:42.226
...they will not step into this most hallowed
and forbidden no-man's land.

10:42.393 --> 10:44.645
But Batgirl will.

10:47.398 --> 10:48.524
What are we going to do?

10:48.691 --> 10:52.862
We can't step into that hallowed and forbidden
no-man's land without closing our eyes.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.322
And if we close our eyes,
we can't see anything.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.741
Uh, a sound observation, Robin.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.119
You can't go in there, but I can.

11:00.286 --> 11:02.204
And with my eyes wide-open.

11:08.586 --> 11:11.672
Come out, come out, wherever you are,
Catwoman.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.215
Right here.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.969
She's been in there over a minute.

11:17.136 --> 11:19.722
- I hope nothing's gone wrong.
-We can't wait any longer.

11:19.889 --> 11:21.599
Cover your eyes.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.767
Now, let's go in.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.944
Close the door, Robin. There are other eyes.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.906
Batgirl, are you in here?

11:37.072 --> 11:40.993
- Catwoman kidnapped her, Batman.
-Holy Robert Louis Stevenson.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.787
- Which direction did they go?
-Out through the side door.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.916
- Thank you.
-Oh, no, no. To your left.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.252
Oh.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.171
Excuse me.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.298
Careful, Robin.

11:54.465 --> 11:56.550
I think it's a lady.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.053
Take my cape.

12:01.472 --> 12:03.641
- Ooh.
-Ah.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.311
May I suggest you take your hands
away from your eyes?

12:07.478 --> 12:11.232
You're liable to maim yourself.
We're fully clothed.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.613
What now, Batman?

12:17.780 --> 12:20.699
- She's probably got a big head start on us.
-Yes.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.911
I'm certain it's all part of a plan
to kidnap Batgirl.

12:24.078 --> 12:25.704
But Why?

12:25.871 --> 12:28.582
Do you think she'll kill Batgirl?

12:28.832 --> 12:30.709
Or worse, Robin.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.670
Or worse.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.973
We can't miss, boys.

12:44.139 --> 12:48.060
This is the most catacaustic plan
in my catalog of crime.

12:48.227 --> 12:49.687
It looks all right in theory...

12:49.853 --> 12:53.023
...but how are you gonna keep Batman
and Robin from sticking their masks in it?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.067
Hmm. Simplicity itself.

12:55.234 --> 12:58.237
Look. Here we are on Pussyfoot Road...

12:58.404 --> 13:01.031
...and here is the Belgravian embassy...

13:01.198 --> 13:04.159
...where Batman has been invited
by Queen Bess...

13:04.326 --> 13:06.996
...for a private audience at 3:00.

13:07.162 --> 13:10.499
So we steal the Golden Fleece there...

13:10.666 --> 13:14.712
...at the precise moment
the Turgid Twosome arrive here...

13:14.878 --> 13:19.383
...to rescue their precious ally Batgirl.

13:19.550 --> 13:23.762
Oh, you mean
they can't be in two places at once.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.390
No, Angora, they can't.

13:26.557 --> 13:30.811
And no hero worth his salt
would let a lady expire.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.896
It's foolproof, I tell you.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.024
Perfectly foolproof.

13:35.190 --> 13:39.486
And you, Catwoman, are an even bigger fool
than I thought you were.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.948
We who enforce the law
would gladly lay down our lives for it.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.742
Batman won't be here.

13:44.908 --> 13:48.579
He'll be at the Belgravian embassy
thwarting your nefarious scheme.

13:48.746 --> 13:50.372
Angora gag her.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.917
Crime-fightresses should be seen
and not heard.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.462
There.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.256
That's all we'll hear of her nonsense.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.759
Manx, set up the pattern cutter.

14:03.761 --> 14:08.307
You'd better pray that Batman is a "man" man
more than he is a policeman.

14:08.474 --> 14:11.268
Angora, get her ready for the grand opening.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.984
Yes, my dear.
You will make a perfect pinafore.

14:19.151 --> 14:24.114
The type of garment
no one will recognize you in or as. Heh, heh.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.034
If you should pardon a final cutting remark.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.460
Ah.

14:42.216 --> 14:46.095
So far, all of her crimes seem to have followed
a preordained scheme.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.721
Have you figured it out, Robin?

14:47.888 --> 14:51.600
Well, first she attacked those ladies
at that luncheon with a hair-raising bomb.

14:51.767 --> 14:55.312
And then she stole
all those one-of-a-kind clothes.

14:55.479 --> 14:59.149
It would appear she's on an apparel binge
of some kind.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.611
No doubt.
Now, what could she do for a topper?

15:02.778 --> 15:07.491
Something connected with clothing
that might cap her crimes to date.

15:07.658 --> 15:10.035
Holy priceless collection
of Etruscan snoods.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.621
- Right, Batman?
-Wrong.

15:12.788 --> 15:16.959
There isn't much call for Etruscan snoods
these days, Robin.

15:17.126 --> 15:20.921
Besides, Catwoman's mind
is more commercial.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.633
Speaking of minds, sir, if I may be so bold...

15:24.800 --> 15:26.844
Uh, be bold, Alfred.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.556
It would appear that your mind
is not really on the subject you're pursuing.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.349
Very observant, Alfred.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.934
My mind's on Batgirl.

15:34.101 --> 15:37.020
Wherever she is,
whatever dire danger she faces.

15:37.187 --> 15:41.191
And we have an audience
with Queen Bess of Belgravia at exactly 3:00.

15:41.358 --> 15:44.445
Yes, another mental aggravation facing us.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.238
But can't you postpone it, sir?

15:46.405 --> 15:48.532
No, diplomatic protocol forbids it, Alfred.

15:48.699 --> 15:51.702
She specifically requested meeting us...

15:51.869 --> 15:55.873
...to discuss the rise
in Belgravian misdemeanors.

15:56.039 --> 16:00.210
Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara
are waiting now to accompany us to--

16:01.003 --> 16:03.839
And to get back to Catwoman.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.174
What is it, Batman?

16:05.340 --> 16:10.387
Queen Bess of Belgravia has a Golden Fleece
she wears for special occasions.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.806
No doubt she's brought it with her
to Gotham City.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.642
It's spun from pure gold,
and it's worth a fortune, Robin.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.895
But what would Catwoman want with that?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.731
It's too hot to handle
for any self-respecting fence.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.234
But if it were to be stolen from Queen Bess...

16:24.401 --> 16:27.070
...Belgravia would be up a creek
without a fleece.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.907
They might even declare war on our country.

16:30.073 --> 16:33.827
No doubt Queen Bess would mortgage herself
to the hilt to get it back.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.662
Nobody wants war.

16:36.079 --> 16:40.417
Gee, Batman, Belgravia's such a small country.
We'd beat them in a few hours.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.296
Yes, and then we'd have to support them
for years.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.507
Come on, Robin. Her Majesty awaits.

16:46.673 --> 16:51.345
And just perhaps we'll get some clue
as to Batgirl's whereabouts.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.974
It's 20 minutes of 3, Batgirl.

16:56.141 --> 17:01.396
The next sound you hear will be
an automatic pattern cutter with teeth of steel.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.775
It will take just 20 minutes
to do the work cut out for it.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.778
To cut you into a perfect pinafore.

17:28.382 --> 17:32.135
And that's why I think Catwoman will be
at the Belgravian embassy, commissioner.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.639
- A brilliant deduction, Batman.
-I couldn't have done better meself. Heh.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.307
It's 20 minutes to 3.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.643
Time, to coin a phrase, is a-wasting.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.146
- Yes, Bonnie.
- Hello, <i>baby.</i>

17:43.313 --> 17:46.692
<i>This is Catwoman purring
in your shell-like ear.</i>

17:46.858 --> 17:48.652
You-- You--

17:48.819 --> 17:51.154
You have some nerve calling me here,
Catwoman.

17:51.321 --> 17:54.157
Just doing my duty as a citizen,
commissioner.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.326
Helping to save a life.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.703
To whom are you referring?

17:57.869 --> 18:01.999
None other than Batgirl,
the distaff crime-fighter.

18:02.165 --> 18:05.127
- Batgirl?
-May I have that, commissioner?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.588
This is Batman, Catwoman.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.966
Oh. Heh.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.343
Speak of the angel.

18:13.510 --> 18:17.347
Just what are you doing,
and to whom are you doing it?

18:17.723 --> 18:21.727
You'd better get to 32 Pussyfoot Road,
Batman...

18:21.893 --> 18:28.066
...where a steel pattern cutter
is just going to work on Batgirl.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.074
Great Scott.

18:36.241 --> 18:42.706
Be here at 3:00 on the button
if you don't want to find Batgirl beside herself.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.420
Holy dilemma.

18:48.587 --> 18:51.923
If we go to rescue Batgirl,
Catwoman escapes with the Golden Fleece.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.968
And if we go after Catwoman, Batgirl dies.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.429
What--? What are you gonna do?

18:58.597 --> 19:01.391
You go to the Belgravian embassy
and look for trouble.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.935
Yes, Catwoman may be there.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.229
You go quickly and we'll join you there.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.774
But be wary.
You must be on time for the audience...

19:08.940 --> 19:12.694
...or you're liable to incur Queen Bess'
renowned and redoubtable royal wrath.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.280
Heaven forbid. Come on, chief.

19:18.492 --> 19:21.495
I had to get rid of them, Robin,
so that we could use the phone.

19:21.662 --> 19:25.165
32 Pussyfoot Road is not far
from Wayne Manor.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.251
<i>Just pray that Alfred is near the Batphone.</i>

19:34.091 --> 19:37.427
- This is one of your sticky wickets, Alfred.
-indeed, sir.

19:37.594 --> 19:42.182
If she recognizes you as Bruce Wayne's butler,
she's liable to analyze the connection...

19:42.349 --> 19:45.227
...and learn Robin's and my
secret true identities.

19:45.394 --> 19:49.231
But we have to take the chance.
Otherwise Batgirl dies.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.608
What do you suggest, sir?

19:51.775 --> 19:55.445
A disguise. Something as alien as possible
to your normal self.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.572
But speed is of the essence.

20:00.117 --> 20:05.789
<i>NARRATOR". And what of Queen Bess
of Belgravia and the glittering Golden Fleece?</i>

20:05.956 --> 20:07.207
Is it 3:00 yet?

20:07.374 --> 20:09.418
Almost, Your Royal Goodness.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.462
-It's two minutes of.
-Oh.

20:12.629 --> 20:16.633
Well, then we must prepare
to meet our guests.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.978
- Who are you?
-Catwoman.

20:28.145 --> 20:29.980
Is she on my list for today's audience?

20:30.147 --> 20:31.690
No, Your Royal Goodness.

20:31.857 --> 20:34.985
Call my social secretary for an appointment.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.822
Sorry, queenie, but I'm antisocial.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.009
Oh! Thank you, whoever you are.

20:59.176 --> 21:01.052
Think nothing of it, sweetheart.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.972
As a matter of fact, it was selfish of me.

21:04.139 --> 21:07.267
- Selfish?
-Yes. I'm the janitor here.

21:07.434 --> 21:11.438
If that machine had sliced you to bits,
I'd have to clean up the mess.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.483
- You look very familiar to me.
-Me?

21:14.649 --> 21:17.736
Oh, no. No, I'm the oldest living hippie
in this country.

21:17.903 --> 21:22.365
You may have heard about my being the first
Boy Scout dropout at the turn of a century.

21:22.532 --> 21:25.202
Mm. Love.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.245
See you around.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.799
How very nice of you to come.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.342
And tell me...

21:40.509 --> 21:45.806
...where is the much-admired Batman
and his youthful companion?

21:46.056 --> 21:49.059
I'm afraid Batman may be a few minutes late,
Your Highness.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.061
Well, it's too bad.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.189
If they had been here, they might be able
to save your worthless hides.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.816
I beg your pardon?

21:56.399 --> 21:59.069
Saints preserve us, it's Catwoman.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.906
In the adorable fur.

22:03.073 --> 22:06.409
Now that Batman and Robin are not here
to fight your battles for you...

22:06.576 --> 22:10.038
...let me see how really brave
you timorous tabbies are.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.581
Get them.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.085
It seems we arrived at an opportune moment,
Catwoman.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.420
Gosh, yes, Batman. Holy crucial moment.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.131
Most apt, Boy Blunderer.

22:20.298 --> 22:24.845
But the presence of you here indicates
that you have forsaken your partner in crime...

22:25.011 --> 22:26.513
...in order to pursue me.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.518
Batgirl. Hsss!

22:31.685 --> 22:34.271
Not a perfect pinafore, Catwoman.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.815
Get them.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.816
Crime is a bad habit, Catwoman.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.736
Let's go. Warden Crichton awaits.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.621
You know what this is, Batman?

23:32.787 --> 23:35.707
The Royal Order of the Belgravian Garter.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.084
Five decorations. One for each of us.

23:38.251 --> 23:41.838
For finding Her Majesty's Golden Fleece
and returning it to her.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.840
And for finding Her Majesty...

23:44.007 --> 23:47.010
...locked up in a closet
off that throne room, she was.

23:47.177 --> 23:50.180
And it's a lucky thing
that we discovered her too.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.891
There are enough international crises
running around...

23:53.058 --> 23:55.393
...without us starting one with Belgravia.

23:59.648 --> 24:00.690
Yes, Bonnie?

24:00.857 --> 24:03.610
<i>I thought you should turn on your television set.</i>

24:03.777 --> 24:06.071
<i>A roving live-TV unit has picked up
something shocking...</i>

24:06.237 --> 24:08.365
<i>...happening right now in Gotham City.</i>

24:08.531 --> 24:10.450
Thank you, Bonnie.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.210
Holy homecoming, Egghead and Olga.

24:20.377 --> 24:23.380
Queen of the Bessarovian Cossacks.

24:24.589 --> 24:29.386
No doubt back to bother, badger
and bewilder Gotham City once more.

24:29.552 --> 24:32.806
<i>NARRATOR". Egghead, Olga
and her Bessarovian Cossacks are back...</i>

24:32.973 --> 24:35.183
<i>...with another assortment of devilish plots.</i>

24:35.350 --> 24:39.062
<i>All happening here in our next episode.</i>
