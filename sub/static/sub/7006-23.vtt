WEBVTT

00:04.404 --> 00:07.430
- Hey, Tim. What's up?
- Hey, daddy-o!

00:08.241 --> 00:10.539
You know, in 3-D, you got 1 6 chins.

00:11.511 --> 00:15.379
<i>Oh, no. Don't tell me they bought
your idea to do Tool Time in 3-D.</i>

00:15.448 --> 00:17.006
<i>Not just Tool Time.</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:20.519
For one night, every show on the
station is gonna be 3-D, right?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.282
<i>- Knitting With Norm.
- No!</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:25.483
<i>- Cooking With Erma.
- That'll be a great ratings grabber.</i>

00:25.558 --> 00:29.324
What, we have Erma's fish kabobs
flying at the camera?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.923
- So it sounds a little cheesy.
- Sounds cheesy?

00:32.999 --> 00:35.661
Alright, it is cheesy!
That's what makes it fun.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.499
We'll follow in the footsteps
of 3-D horror classics,

00:38.571 --> 00:42.940
<i>Doctor Fong's House of
Chain Gang Cheerleaders.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:45.033
[grunting] Oh, yeah.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.204
[Asian accent] Love Doctor Fong!

00:48.548 --> 00:51.415
l never liked 3-D, you know?

00:51.484 --> 00:56.148
<i>When l was a kid, my favorite movie
was The Sound of Music.</i>

00:58.258 --> 01:01.193
Now there's a movie that
would've been better in 3-D.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.593
Can you imagine 50 nuns
coming at you like ping-pong balls?

01:06.266 --> 01:08.496
Like a bad habit!

01:10.370 --> 01:14.306
What place does 3-D have
in a serious tool show?

01:14.374 --> 01:17.343
<i>None. That's why we're
doing it on Tool Time.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:20.971
A visual feast. The audience will feel
like they're on the set with me.

01:21.047 --> 01:24.016
So they can feel the same terror l do.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.246
Lighten up. Look at the equipment.
lt's so cool. Two cameras.

01:28.321 --> 01:32.485
One shoots at a 45-degree angle. Put
the equipment together, tape comes out.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.755
Put on the glasses. Ba-da-bing!
You're scared half to death.

01:35.862 --> 01:39.161
Well, it'll take a lot
more than 3-D to scare Al Borland.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.325
Really. Put 'em on.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.767
l'll show you the
tape l did this afternoon.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.566
[Al] Whoa!

01:47.640 --> 01:50.609
lt's so real! l can almost feel it!

01:51.478 --> 01:53.036
[screams]

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.801 --> 02:52.862
Brad, big news. l pre-soaked your shirt
and got out the tomato soup stain.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.305
Wow, that is big news!

02:55.408 --> 02:58.172
When do they start giving out
those Nobel prizes?

02:59.579 --> 03:01.012
- Hi, guys.
- [boys] Hi, Mom.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.048
- Hi, Mrs. Taylor.
- Oh, hi, Angela.

03:03.116 --> 03:07.018
l washed your socks. Show me the
drawer they go in, l'll put them away.

03:07.086 --> 03:09.145
Alright. Follow me.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.222
Why is Angela doing Brad's laundry?

03:13.293 --> 03:16.729
She probably wanted something to do
after she cleaned his room.

03:18.231 --> 03:21.098
She cleaned his room?
How long has this been going on?

03:21.167 --> 03:23.294
l don't know, but she does nice work.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.768
You know, l'm gonna ask her
if she can give me a Wednesday.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.534
l wonder if Angela has a younger sister.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.137
My closet's a mess.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.184
OK, wait. Hold it!
Hold it right there, both of you.

03:38.284 --> 03:42.448
l did not raise my sons
to regard women as servants.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.217
l've taught you to be
responsible and independent.

03:45.291 --> 03:49.193
You do your own chores, clean up your
own messes. And under no circumstances

03:49.262 --> 03:53.494
do you ever treat the female sex
as though they are housekeepers

03:53.566 --> 03:56.034
put here to wait on you hand and foot!

03:56.102 --> 03:58.593
Honey, you want to
pop that in the washer for me?

04:04.477 --> 04:07.310
l think l'll just pop on out of here.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.910
- l think l'll pop on out of here.
- Tim...

04:10.984 --> 04:13.544
- ...we have a terrible situation here.
- What?

04:14.287 --> 04:19.247
Brad is letting Angela do his laundry.

04:19.358 --> 04:22.192
Oh, my God!

04:23.129 --> 04:25.188
Whites or colors?

04:26.899 --> 04:29.595
Do you really not get
what's wrong with this picture?

04:30.336 --> 04:33.897
Same old story, isn't it?
Boy meets girl, girl does boy's laundry,

04:34.007 --> 04:36.373
and l get yelled at.

04:41.914 --> 04:45.145
Wow, Angela does good work!

04:46.252 --> 04:49.278
Yeah. She does, doesn't she?

04:49.355 --> 04:51.823
l want to talk about you two.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.459
Mom, we've already had the sex talk.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.064
This isn't the sex talk.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.157
This is the socks talk.

05:03.169 --> 05:06.332
l was kind of disappointed to hear

05:06.406 --> 05:09.569
that you asked Angela
to do your laundry and chores for you.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.543
- l didn't ask. She offered.
- You could've said no.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.876
l didn't want to be impolite.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.508
Tell me something.
Do you do anything for Angela?

05:18.618 --> 05:21.086
l don't know. We don't keep score.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.520
ln other words, nothing?

05:25.591 --> 05:27.957
Honey, this sets
a really bad precedent.

05:28.027 --> 05:30.393
lt puts the female
in a subservient position.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.330
ls this gonna be another one
of your feminist lectures?

05:33.399 --> 05:36.334
Brad, women have worked
really hard to achieve equality.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.768
l know. And the right to make
their own choices.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.931
- Exactly!
- Angela's choice is to do my laundry.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.977
lt's anti-feminist of you
to judge her for that.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.605
You're destroying everything
women have worked so hard to achieve.

05:56.589 --> 06:00.355
l got nowhere. l tried to talk to Brad.
He didn't understand what l was saying.

06:00.426 --> 06:04.089
Just keep hammering it into him.
He'll come around to your point of view.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.663
As opposed to your point of view,
which would be?

06:09.736 --> 06:12.034
Same as yours.

06:13.473 --> 06:17.637
So you agree that Brad
shouldn't let Angela do his chores?

06:17.744 --> 06:21.180
The truth, honey? l think you're
making a big deal out of this.

06:21.247 --> 06:24.307
Learning to treat women
as equals is a very big deal.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.150
The kid's 1 6. He's got plenty of time
to develop a mature relationship

06:28.254 --> 06:31.223
and learn how to play the game.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.294
''The game.''

06:36.362 --> 06:39.889
Brad'll figure out pretty soon
that in order to make peace with women,

06:39.966 --> 06:44.528
- you have to pitch in now and then.
- ''To make peace.''

06:45.671 --> 06:49.300
So that's the only reason
that you do anything around here?

06:49.909 --> 06:52.673
And because l really like it.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.215
You do not.
You're just playing ''the game.''

06:59.585 --> 07:01.815
The important thing is
that l help you out.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.378
- ''Help me out?''
- Yeah.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.822
Do you have any idea
how demeaning that sounds?

07:06.993 --> 07:10.019
l used to be a lot better
at playing this game.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.530
You're implying that all the
housework is... is my responsibility!

07:15.635 --> 07:18.502
Except, occasionally, when you
grace me with your help!

07:18.571 --> 07:21.267
l didn't say that.
You may do more housework,

07:21.340 --> 07:24.434
but l do yard work to help out.
l work on the cars to help you out.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.912
- You work on the cars to help me out?
- Yeah.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.742
Well, thank you.
Because, you know,

07:31.818 --> 07:36.846
my life is gonna be so much easier when
the hot rod has six-to-one compression.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.425
Actually, it'll have eight-to-one.

07:41.861 --> 07:45.957
Tim, this is not about
who does more housework.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.933
This has to do with setting
a good example for the boys.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.936
l think l set a darn good example
for the boys, thank you.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.733
l know you do. lt's just that...

07:53.806 --> 07:57.537
...this is a really pivotal time in
their lives, and they need to know that

07:57.610 --> 08:01.774
you share the responsibilities with me
because you want to be an equal partner.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.408
l like that. lt's good.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.810
And it's fine with me
if you want to tell them that.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.926
Don't you think...

08:14.994 --> 08:18.293
...that it would
be better coming from you?

08:19.031 --> 08:21.295
Something tells me l do.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.600
- l'm glad you guys are here.
- Want to play some ball?

08:27.673 --> 08:31.302
No. l think it would be a lot
more fun to talk about relationships.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.208
Huh?

08:36.282 --> 08:40.514
l just want you both to know that your
mom and l share an equal relationship.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.145
We share responsibilities equally.

08:43.256 --> 08:48.717
- What did you do this time?
- What makes you think l did anything?

08:48.794 --> 08:51.558
You're a guy.
You don't talk about relationships.

08:51.664 --> 08:55.225
Such a sexist attitude.
Have you learned nothing from me?

08:55.334 --> 08:57.996
Did you drop another beam on Mom's car?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.029
l didn't drop anything on Mom's car!

09:01.107 --> 09:03.268
l know what this is about.
Mom's angry at Brad

09:03.376 --> 09:06.641
for letting Angela do his laundry,
and she's taking it out on Dad.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.340
She wants to make sure
l'm a good role model for you.

09:09.415 --> 09:13.181
Do you really think Angela doing
Brad's laundry is such a terrible thing?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.811
lf a girl wanted to
do my laundry, l wouldn't mind.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.583
- You should mind!
- Why?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.921
l don't know.

09:22.261 --> 09:25.230
lt seems to me you got
plenty of time to get beaten down.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.699
What do you mean?

09:28.768 --> 09:30.861
Well, eventually,
it happens to all of us.

09:30.937 --> 09:35.237
You meet that special someone who
forces you into an equal relationship.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.971
Excuse me?

09:43.349 --> 09:46.318
And there's that special someone now.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.254
How could you say that?

09:52.325 --> 09:55.692
How could you say that men
are beaten down by women?

09:55.761 --> 09:58.594
Stop that, there are
sharp chicken bones in there.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.360
You promised you'd
set a good example for the boys.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.959
They saw through me.
They know me better than that.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.597
l guess they know you better than l do.
l thought you were gonna back me up.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.875
lf l have one flaw,
it's that l'm honest.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.536
lf you have one flaw,
l'm Cindy Crawford.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.546
Thanks to your honesty,
we've now not only lost Brad,

10:18.618 --> 10:21.178
we might as well write off
Mark and Randy as well.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.915
We haven't lost anybody.
Let me ask you a question.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.857
What would happen if the boys
turned out just like me?

10:26.926 --> 10:30.794
lt would be the strongest
argument yet against cloning.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.323
Hey, don't bring sheep into this.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.198
Look, Tim, if you don't set
a good example for the boys,

10:41.273 --> 10:44.731
how are they gonna have
healthy relationships with women?

10:44.810 --> 10:49.270
- 'Cause we have a healthy relationship.
- Only if l ''force'' you to.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.881
l can't help how l am.

10:51.951 --> 10:55.284
Men have a chromosome you women
don't have. The ''Y'' chromosome.

10:55.354 --> 10:58.619
As in ''Y'' do l have to
talk about the relationship?

11:02.762 --> 11:05.788
And ''Y'' do l have to put up with this?

11:06.298 --> 11:09.927
You know why? Because men are men.
No matter how much you want to,

11:10.002 --> 11:12.664
you can't turn men into women,
it can't be done.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.901
Well, it can be.
But it's very expensive.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.836
And you still end up with
an Adam's apple and big hands.

11:21.747 --> 11:25.239
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!</i>

11:25.317 --> 11:29.481
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present, Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

11:29.555 --> 11:33.013
- Woo-hoo!
- [audience cheers,applauds]

11:34.894 --> 11:39.263
Well, thank you, everybody.
Thank you, everybody.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.889
Thank you, Heidi.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.196
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.897
And you all know my assistant,
Al Borland!

11:45.971 --> 11:47.939
[audience cheers, applauds]

11:48.207 --> 11:52.735
<i>Thank you. We have a
very special Tool Time for you...</i>

11:52.812 --> 11:56.578
[shouting] ...presented in 3-D!

11:59.452 --> 12:03.548
Just because it's in 3-D doesn't
mean you have to yell at them, Al.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.182
- [quietly] Sorry.
- Al is actually a pro at this.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.556
You probably remember
his old 3-D movies:

12:08.627 --> 12:11.152
<i>Beard Man from Alcatraz,</i>

12:11.864 --> 12:14.890
<i>Creature from the Flannel Lagoon.</i>

12:15.167 --> 12:18.068
ln that movie, l cried until l stopped.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.067
<i>And, who could forget,
It Came from Baskin-Robbins.</i>

12:24.009 --> 12:26.375
Remember, 3-D is just an illusion.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.879
ln reality, Tim has no depth.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.985
[sizzling sounds, hissing]

12:34.754 --> 12:38.121
Alright, it's springtime.
Time to think about barbecues.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.556
Bring out those fatty foods
and that Frisbee.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.993
At the Borland home,
spring always began at the picnic table.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.896
After they were done eating that...

12:47.967 --> 12:51.403
Today we're going to show you
how to build a picnic table.

12:51.470 --> 12:55.770
Your table's dimensions depend on
how many people you plan to seat.

12:55.841 --> 12:58.708
[both] Whoa... Whoa!

12:58.944 --> 13:03.472
And, actually, we precut our two-by-six
boards to the proper... length!

13:03.549 --> 13:06.780
[both] Whoa!

13:06.852 --> 13:11.812
OK. We'll fasten those down with our
two-by-four braces using wood screws...

13:11.891 --> 13:15.952
- And this drill.
- [both] Whoa... Whoa!

13:17.530 --> 13:19.088
Thank you, Heidi.

13:19.198 --> 13:23.100
We've already miter-cut our legs,
we're ready to bolt them together.

13:23.169 --> 13:27.265
Remember, the secret
to a tight fit is good notches.

13:27.339 --> 13:31.366
<i>And for our Tool Time fans south
of the border, that's ''Buenas notches.''</i>

13:35.347 --> 13:37.907
OK, while Al's finishing up those legs,

13:38.017 --> 13:40.485
l'll move on to
cut the hole for the umbrella.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.421
[drill spinning]

13:56.869 --> 14:01.238
OK, now we're
all ready for our picnic. [grunting]

14:01.874 --> 14:05.241
[both] Whoa... Whoa...

14:05.344 --> 14:07.505
Whoa!

14:09.849 --> 14:12.818
Tablecloth. Alright, Heidi,
how about our picnic basket?

14:12.918 --> 14:15.148
- Oh...
- What am l thinking? l'll get that.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.951
- OK. Are you sure?
- Sure. Sit, let me get that for you.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.321
- Thanks.
- See what we got to eat here.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.952
- A nice tossed salad for Heidi.
- Thank you.

14:23.062 --> 14:25.963
- A little fried chicken for me.
- What do you have for me?

14:26.031 --> 14:30.400
Oh, l know how you like hot dogs. l got
one here you'll like ten times as much.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.996
[all] Whoa... Whoa... Whoa!

14:41.146 --> 14:43.910
[Wilson] Well, neighborette,
l have outdone myself.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.747
This year my tulips
are more gorgeous than ever.

14:46.852 --> 14:50.083
- They are gorgeous. What's your secret?
- A very good florist.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.321
[laughs] So how does your garden grow?

14:54.426 --> 14:57.918
Oh, it's a little heavy
on the manure lately.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.730
Brad thinks it's OK to have
Angela do his chores for him.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.894
Tim doesn't see
anything wrong with that.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.803
Oh, men!

15:09.942 --> 15:12.604
No matter how much ground
we feminists have gained,

15:12.678 --> 15:15.511
there is still so much work
left to be done.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.574
''We'' feminists?

15:18.651 --> 15:21.620
l've always been a big proponent
of the women's movement.

15:21.687 --> 15:25.453
You know, l spent most of the sixties
with my face behind a protest sign.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.157
Well, here l am in this
whole house full of men.

15:29.228 --> 15:33.722
l'm disgusted with myself because l've
had absolutely no impact on any of them.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.003
Remember that time that
l gave Tim Betty Friedan's book?

15:38.103 --> 15:41.869
<i>- You know, The Feminine Mystique?
- Mmm-hmm. l take it he didn't like it?</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:43.374
He loved it.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.502
He used it to level the legs
of his workbench.

15:48.314 --> 15:51.283
[sighs] Oh, sister, sister, sister.

15:52.751 --> 15:56.710
The thing that really upsets me
is to see Brad not respecting women.

15:56.789 --> 16:01.226
Well, Jill, Brad is new in his
relationships with the opposite sex.

16:01.293 --> 16:05.457
- l'm sure he's just testing the water.
- Angela's using it to wash his clothes.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.795
[chuckles]

16:07.866 --> 16:11.324
- Well, l'm sure that's gonna change.
- You think there's hope?

16:11.403 --> 16:13.166
Oh, sure l do.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.207
The English novelist,
Jilly Cooper, would agree with me.

16:16.275 --> 16:20.211
She said, ''The male is a domestic animal
which, when treated with firmness

16:20.279 --> 16:23.442
and kindness,
can be trained to do anything.''

16:25.250 --> 16:28.708
- Who trained you?
- The English novelist, Jilly Cooper.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.923
We had a brief fling
during my semester at Oxford.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.990
You know, l never realized
l was becoming enlightened

16:37.062 --> 16:41.226
until one day l found myself wearing
her apron and frosting her cupcakes.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.402
- [Brad] l'm kinda hungry!
- Me too.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.304
- Make me a ham sandwich?
- Sure.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.740
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.209
How about you, Dad?
You want her to make you one?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.773
l don't need Angela
to make me a sandwich.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.010
- She doesn't mind.
- l don't mind.

16:59.118 --> 17:02.383
- l don't need a sandwich. Thanks.
- l could toss you a salad.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.819
l'm really not that hungry,
but thanks anyway.

17:04.923 --> 17:08.689
Hey, uh... l finished recessing
the other turn indicator in the garage.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.230
- Would you take a look at it with me?
- Yeah. Cool.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.663
- Excuse us for a minute.
- l'll be right back.

17:17.269 --> 17:22.502
- [Tim sighs] Very smooth, Brad.
- Yeah. Great job filing the edges.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.941
l'm talking about you and Angela.
Snap your finger, she jumps.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.343
Yeah. lt's great, isn't it?

17:30.115 --> 17:33.380
l don't know. Do you ever wonder
why she does stuff like that?

17:33.452 --> 17:36.114
- She enjoys it.
- l'm not so sure.

17:36.188 --> 17:41.023
Some girls do that cause they're afraid
if they don't, men won't like them.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.254
- Where'd you hear that?
- l read it.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.322
You know that book
that's holding up the workbench?

17:52.271 --> 17:54.831
<i>lt's called, The Feminine Mistake.</i>

17:58.243 --> 18:00.575
lt's written by Betsy Freeloader.

18:04.283 --> 18:07.252
- So now you're a feminist, too?
- l don't know what l am.

18:07.319 --> 18:10.413
There's stuff in there about
relationships that makes sense.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.322
When the girl does
all the work, it's not good.

18:13.392 --> 18:16.884
You're saying this because you
ended up marrying somebody like Mom.

18:16.962 --> 18:20.329
- Excuse me?
- Well, don't get me wrong. l love Mom.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.924
l didn't ''end up'' with Mom.
l love her because she's a strong woman.

18:24.002 --> 18:28.166
- You like her giving you a hard time?
- Yeah.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.674
That's what makes it exciting.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.872
l keep trying to think of
new ways to slip stuff by her...

18:37.082 --> 18:40.017
...and she's always coming up
with new ways to nail me.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.845
We're equal partners.

18:43.922 --> 18:49.053
- And you think that's good?
- Well, l don't know. lt works for me.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.923
But maybe having Angela as your
''sandwich girl'' works for you.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.864
Her whole life is sandwiches.

18:55.934 --> 19:00.166
''Make me another sandwich. Sandwich,
sandwich! Make another sandwich!''

19:03.108 --> 19:04.075
Where's Brad?

19:04.176 --> 19:07.475
ln the garage looking at the hot rod.
l'm making him a sandwich.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.976
Angela, do you really think
that's a good idea?

19:11.049 --> 19:13.517
Why? Do you think
he'd rather have turkey?

19:15.554 --> 19:19.217
- We have to have a talk.
- OK, when l'm done with the sandwich.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.816
Think he'll want fruit?
l'll cut up an orange.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.421
[sighs] Sister, sister, sister.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.161
Brad, what kind of mustard do you want?

19:28.233 --> 19:29.996
Mild goes best with dill pickles.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.798
lf you want sweet pickles,
l'll give you the Dijon.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.431
l also need to know
what kind of cheese you want.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.067
You shouldn't be making me a sandwich.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.475
- l don't mind.
- l do.

19:40.546 --> 19:44.312
- Don't you like my sandwiches?
- l like you.

19:44.416 --> 19:47.510
l don't think a girl should do stuff
for a guy when he can do it.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.520
Yes!

19:52.391 --> 19:54.291
When did you start feeling this way?

19:54.359 --> 19:57.920
Oh, l don't know. About three minutes
ago when l was in the garage.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.026
Wow! Making your own sandwich.

20:02.134 --> 20:05.865
Save some of that lunch meat,
there's other carnivores around here.

20:07.573 --> 20:10.337
- Tim!
- What did l do now?

20:11.543 --> 20:14.068
You know what you did.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.842
- Mmm...
- No, l don't. But l'm not sure l care.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.090
- Good night, Al. Good night, Tim.
- Goodnight. l'll take care of those.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.922
How much longer are you gonna stay?

20:29.027 --> 20:31.757
l'm waiting for the 3-D guys
to pick up their cameras.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.596
Well, just make sure when they
pick them up they're still in one piece.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.634
[humming]

20:51.250 --> 20:53.081
Whoa.

20:53.619 --> 20:57.453
Look out! Look out! Look out!

20:59.057 --> 21:00.991
What do you suppose we have in here?

21:01.493 --> 21:04.462
- Snakes!
- [metal clanking]

21:04.563 --> 21:06.929
Put the money in the bag.
l'm not joking.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.967
Do l look like l'm joking?

21:32.824 --> 21:34.758
They saw through me.
They know me.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.987
l guess they know you better than l do.

21:37.062 --> 21:41.021
- l thought you'd back me up.
- lf l have one flaw, it's being honest.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.694
lf you have one flaw,
l'm Cimby Crawford.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.534
- ''Cimby?''
- l'm ''Cimby.''

21:49.441 --> 21:52.205
Men are born with a chromosome
women don't even have.

21:52.277 --> 21:56.145
The ''Y'' chromosome. As in ''Y'' do l have
to keep talking about relationships?

21:56.214 --> 21:59.945
- And ''Y'' do l have to put up with this?
- [laughs]
