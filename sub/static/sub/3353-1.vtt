55:36.680 --> 55:38.682

55:39.680 --> 55:43.480
Yeah, but the angel,
the Spirit of Justice,

55:43.640 --> 55:45.130
he's alive in there?

55:45.920 --> 55:47.729
Somewhere?

55:47.880 --> 55:49.689
He could be.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.844
Do you feel him?

55:59.840 --> 56:01.285
No.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.761

Soon you will be free.

When this is over,

56:29.080 --> 56:30.889
we will share it, huh?

56:34.320 --> 56:35.970
There's something else.

56:36.200 --> 56:37.850
(SIGHS)

56:38.040 --> 56:41.726
This thing that Roarke has
done to you is not easily undone.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.129
You risk death.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.441
(SCOFFS)

56:46.600 --> 56:48.284
Worse than death.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.202
You must confess

56:55.320 --> 56:59.803
the one thing that is most
difficult for you to talk about.

57:14.120 --> 57:15.690
Um...

57:15.840 --> 57:17.285
My dad.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.643
I didn't do it for him.

57:22.560 --> 57:24.608
I made the deal for me.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.284
I couldn't let him go.

57:30.720 --> 57:32.848
It was selfish.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.207
He was ready to die.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.202
He knew it was his time.

57:41.120 --> 57:43.043
And I thought I could change that.

57:45.240 --> 57:46.685
I'm sorry.

57:56.720 --> 58:00.520
This is the lamb of God

58:00.680 --> 58:04.765
that takes away all the sin
from the world.

58:06.640 --> 58:09.849
Happy are those
that are called to receive him.

58:12.360 --> 58:14.601
You say that you're not worthy
to receive him.

58:14.800 --> 58:15.926
I'm not.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.321
Okay, that's good enough.

Ahem. Uh, amen.

Before they could kill him.

him alive.
I think we all

who that would be, Moreau.

Yeah. So now he's

you turned out to be.

What exactly does Roarke
have in mind for Danny?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.600
What are his plans for his son? Is he
putting money away for college? What?

As was the day Danny
was conceived.

The child must be
in his 13th year

before the rite can be performed
on the dawn of winter.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.726
The rite.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.646
Roarke fathered the boy as a vessel,
as a container for his power.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.764
The ritual will transform
his essence,

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.241
his soul into the boy.

Both of you!
Something I would never do.

at the dawn of a new day.

Maybe there's still time.

I think so.

to play hero?

he'd be safe.

it's weak, human.
