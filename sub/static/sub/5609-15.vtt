00:03.295 --> 00:06.253
-| see why my brother likes you.
-James.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.379
When you see ol' Dave,
tell him there's a new sheriff in town.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.876
CRU ELLA: The Author's power
is far greater

00:11.970 --> 00:14.086
than that bearded old man
wanted you to believe.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.134
And when you broke the quill,

00:16.225 --> 00:18.591
you sent it right down here
to the UndenNorld.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.346
And now,
you're going to find it down here,

00:20.437 --> 00:23.349
and you're going to send me
back to our world.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.730

00:37.955 --> 00:39.070
HENRY: Can you please slow down?

00:39.164 --> 00:41.450
Darling, you wouldn't be here
if you didn't like a little danger.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.873
I mean, look at you.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.077
Sneaking away from your family
to bring me back to life.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.832
(CHUCKLES) Such a naughty boy.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.877
ljust want to find the pen
and get this over with.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.333
What am I even looking for?

00:52.427 --> 00:55.464
A sign. A signal. A whiff of ink.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.888
Look, you're the Author,
you're connected to that quill.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.639
Stop. I saw something.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.305
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:06.900 --> 01:08.481
CRU ELLA: Well, there's no pen here.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.356
Just dirt and things that smell like dirt.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.902
I swear. I saw it.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.448
Well, then move those little legs
of yours, and keep looking. Go.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.899
Ugh.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.175
-(GASPS)
-Quiet. We have little time.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.800
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.757
You were a devoted apprentice
to the Sorcerer your entire life.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.059
What unfinished business
could you possibly have?

01:44.146 --> 01:45.932
You, my boy.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.438
I'm here to prevent you
from making a terrible mistake.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.562
You must not resurrect Cruella De Vil.

01:51.653 --> 01:55.692
So the pen can bring someone back.
You told me it couldn't.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.032
That was a necessary half-truth.

01:59.119 --> 02:04.785
Up there, yes. Down here
the rules are a little more flexible.

02:04.875 --> 02:09.744
I saw no reason to tempt you.
The dilemma you're currently in is why.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.877
I'm not getting the pen for Cruella.
I'm getting it for me.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.208
ljust watched my mom become
the Dark One.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.716
I watched Hook die.
And I couldn't do anything.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.013
You are the Author.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.810
As such, you should use the quill only
to record the stories, not create them.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.604
I don't care about
the stupid stories anymore!

02:29.691 --> 02:31.977
I'm sick of sitting on the sidelines.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.229
I want to be a hero.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.562
I want to help my mom
even if it means helping Cruella.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.200
(INHALES DEEPLY)
In the Sorcerer's mansion

02:39.242 --> 02:41.198
lie all his great works of light magic.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.526
The quill included.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.493
It is protected by a powerful spell,

02:46.583 --> 02:49.575
but the Sheriff took the key from me.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.254
Acquire that key and the quill is yours.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.591
Wait, what? You're... You're
helping me?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.132
This is your choice, Henry.

03:01.223 --> 03:06.138
But the only way that I can move on
is if you make the right one.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.843
I trust you.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.666
Come, sit down.
Let me take a look at you.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.828
Are you sure you want to?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.873
Hades sort of
knocked the handsome out of me.

03:34.673 --> 03:35.879
(GRUNHNG)

03:37.634 --> 03:39.716
No one's that powerful.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.148
What's wrong?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.601
lt'sjust, uh...

03:58.947 --> 04:00.403
A lot has happened between us.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.822
Then what's the problem?

04:02.909 --> 04:03.944
I'm the problem.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.360
Emma, you were the Dark One
for six weeks,

04:06.455 --> 04:08.446
and only gave in to the darkness
out of love.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.874
l plunged in headfirst in a second,
for revenge.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.701
l was weak.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.537
Not in the end.

04:17.632 --> 04:22.376
You raised the bar very high, Swan.
And the fact is, I don't measure up.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.711
Let me be the judge of that.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.058
If you didn't, would I have come all
the way down here to try to save you?

04:30.145 --> 04:32.887
That's my point.
I'm not sure I deserve saving.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.101
What are you saying?
That you want to stay down here?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.349
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

04:42.991 --> 04:44.492
Hi. Can I...

04:45.786 --> 04:46.821
Killian?

04:47.537 --> 04:48.526
Liam?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.362
So the rumors are true.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.621
After all these years
my little brother is finally here.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.874
(INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHING)

05:03.637 --> 05:06.219
These fish guts smell particularly foul
this evening.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.764
Come on, Killian. The harder we work,
the sooner we're finished.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.469
(SIGHS) Wish I had your work ethic.
Seems I've inherited Father's.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.305
Don'tjoke about that bastard.

05:16.566 --> 05:21.777
He may have sold us into servitude,
but tomorrow we'll be free men.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.114
Are you serious?
You want to join the King's Navy?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.196
There's a signing bonus of 10 silver.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.541
On top of what we've already saved,

05:33.625 --> 05:36.037
that would buy us our freedom
off this bloody cargo ship.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.618
I know that's your dream, Liam,
but I'm hardly naval material.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.919
If you served an honorable king,
it would change you.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.920
You could be a fine captain
someday, I know it.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.552
"Captain Jones" does have

05:47.597 --> 05:49.098
-a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
-(CHUCKLES)

05:49.182 --> 05:50.888
SILVER: "Captain Jones"?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.641
That'll be the day.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.059
You missed a spot there, Captain.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.943
LIAM: Killian, don't!

06:01.319 --> 06:03.810
Come on. Let him try.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.282
Must be exhausting,
protecting little brother from himself.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.651
Hey.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.200
Won't be your concern much longer.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.994
Because you're both going to be
admirals in the Navy, right?

06:13.456 --> 06:16.994
Fine by me, long as | get paid.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.451
The sober Jones can go
and collect his money.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.411
The drunk one stays as collateral.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.171
Easy, brother.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.041
I'll be back by sunrise.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.173
And then
a proud life in the King's Navy, hmm?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.511
Liam, what about you?
Why are you down here?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.145
| wish I knew.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.439
I've spent countless years
trying to figure out a reason.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.686
There is no reason.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.359
Hades has the game rigged
so no one can leave.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.938
My brother is proof of that.
Never did a bad thing in his life.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.364
He even died nobly,

06:50.452 --> 06:52.363
stopping a treacherous king
from poisoning the realm.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.695
Stop it. You're making me blush.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.326
But Hades has you two trapped
down here, and that cannot stand.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.251
The only way everyone will get free
is if we defeat Hades, once and for all.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.756
Liam, you've been down here
a very long time.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.831
Surely you must know something
that can help us.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.502
I know this is a very dangerous game
you're playing.

07:09.596 --> 07:13.509
There are those who have tried
to overthrow Hades before.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.310
And they always spoke of a... A book
which had the power to defeat him.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.564
I tried to find it myself,
but I'm not even sure what to look for.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.607
I think it's a storybook.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.395
Storybook? Oh, I'd wager
it would take more than stories.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.362
HOOK: No, no, no, no, no.
She's onto something.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.065
In our world, there's a book like this.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.071
Everything up there
has a version down here.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.035
There has to be one in the UndenNorld.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.447
If there's a story in that book
about Hades,

07:38.541 --> 07:41.078
we can learn his weakness
and exploit it.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.087
All right.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.538
If you believe in this, Killian,
I'm with you, till the end.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.591
This fiend trapped me and tortured you.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.380
The day you push your sailors too far...

07:51.471 --> 07:54.053
Is the day that mutiny begins.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.435
In the world above,
this is where I found the storybook.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.974
So...

08:08.655 --> 08:09.644
Sorry.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.240
-REG|NA: Are we really surprised?
-(EXHALES DEEPLY)

08:11.282 --> 08:13.238
That book is the embodiment of hope.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.157
And there's not a lot of that
here in the UndenNorld.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.656
Let's keep looking.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.418
Emma, can we talk?

08:25.463 --> 08:26.964
(SIGHS) Is this like
a protective big-brother talk

08:27.090 --> 08:29.331
where you wanna make sure
I'm good enough for Killian?

08:29.426 --> 08:32.759
No. Because I already know
you're not good enough.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.419
What?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.636
Killian blames himself
for ending up here.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.928
But he told me what happened.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.011
Sounds to me like it's not his fault.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.436
It's yours.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.605
I think we both made mistakes.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.774
Killian's been fighting darkness
his entire life.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.108
And you pushed him off the cliff.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.443
l was trying to save his life.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.278
And it was a bloody selfish thing to do.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.899
He had a chance to die a hero,
to move on. And you took it from him.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.443
That's not fair. I'm down here
risking everything to save him.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.368
And is that really what he needs?
Or what you need?

09:02.459 --> 09:04.450
Were you this self-righteous
when you were alive?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.047
When it came to my brother, yes.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.254
If he defeats Hades today,
he'll forgive himself.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.385
And he'll have another chance
to move on.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.130
When that happens,
stop thinking about your own desires

09:19.267 --> 09:20.803
and let him go.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.320
You all right?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.618
-Yeah, fine. Let's keep looking.
-(DOOR OPENS)

09:42.290 --> 09:44.497
Hey. What's going on?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.503
Oh, looking for the storybook.
You know, UndenNorld edition.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.747
Really?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.625
Well, I think I might know
exactly where it is.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.956
How would you know that?

09:53.009 --> 09:57.002
The Apprentice. I saw him at...
At Granny's.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.136
He said the Sorcerer's mansion
is down here,

09:59.182 --> 10:00.843
and there's a bunch of his stuff inside.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.473
Like the storybook.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.850
-Finally some good news.
-(SIGHS)

10:03.937 --> 10:05.017
HENRY: Well, sort of.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.683
The house is locked with magic,
and the Sheriff has the key.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.181
HOOK: Your evil twin is Sheriff?

10:09.275 --> 10:11.482
Hades has panache, I'll give him that.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.691
Well, it's time for my brother and me
to have an overdue chat.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.987
Well, you won't be alone.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.444
I still owe him a punch
in his pretty mouth for kissing me.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.026
-He kissed you?
-I thought it was you.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.197
Let's go.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.955
In the meanwhile, we should all
go about our usual business.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.282
Hades has eyes everywhere.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.662
We can't have him learning
what we're up to.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.791
A fine plan.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.712
I can't wait to see the look on his face
when he learns a valuable lesson.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.790
One should never mess
with the Brothers Jones.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.967
Captain Silver!

10:44.185 --> 10:45.891
Two papers of service.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.727
I'm pleased to tell you the Brothers
Jones will be leaving your employ.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.722
Well, one of you at least.

10:52.026 --> 10:56.065
What? What's happened?
What did you do to Killian?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.647
All I did was offer him a drink.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.869
The rest he managed all by himself.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.196
He's not much of a gambler.

11:03.538 --> 11:08.407
Killian! Where's the silver?
What have you done with your money?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.538
-You gambled?
-(G RU NTS)

11:13.715 --> 11:15.580
KILLIAN: I'm sorry, brother.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.040
(COINS CLATTERING)

11:20.180 --> 11:21.420
You bastard.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.512
I'm not responsible for his weakness.

11:23.892 --> 11:24.927
And you still have your money.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.932
If you want my advice, cut anchor.
Leave the dead weight behind.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.563
KILLIAN: (SIGHS) Just do it, Liam. Go.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.274
I can never be the brother you deserve.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.353
SILVER: We're to set sail, Jones.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.032
It's either the Navy

11:40.116 --> 11:43.358
or more grain runs
with your favorite captain.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.620
Then grain runs it shall be.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.874
KILLIAN: No.

12:00.386 --> 12:04.129
Come hell or high water,
I cannot leave my brother.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.428
HADES: (SIGHS) Wow.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.141
Even for the UndenNorld,
it is dead in here.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.482
Can I help you?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.273
If you want a drink,
I can make you anything.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.313
That's okay, I can help myself.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.277
This Scotch is a few centuries old.
I think it's aged quite well.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.822
The key is to store it underground.
Here, try some.

12:31.626 --> 12:32.786
(SPUTTERS)

12:40.343 --> 12:41.332
Mmm.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.255
It's good, right?

12:44.681 --> 12:46.967
See, I'm, I'm not such a bad guy.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.678
But here you are
trying to stage some kind of a...

12:50.436 --> 12:54.270
What's that quaint nautical term
you keep using?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.018
(SNAPS FINGERS)
Uh, that's right. Mutiny.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.809
So you found us out.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.274
Well, like you said,
I have eyes everywhere.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.481
What I don't have is that storybook.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.237
-And what do you want from me?
-Not much.

13:07.620 --> 13:12.785
I don't even really care about that book,
except for a few select pages.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.706
The ones about me.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.879
So find the book and destroy them.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.165
Do it yourself.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.755
HADES: It's the Sorcerer's house.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.049
Light magic doesn't agree with me.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.722
So I kind of need you.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.436
And if I refuse?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.561
I'll tell your brother the thing
you never could.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.190
The reason you're really down here.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.566
Looks like my evil twin is out on patrol.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.993
MARY: Great. Then let's find that key
and get the hell out of here.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.082
Top drawer, just like at home.
You two are so alike.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.875
Next you're gonna say
we kiss the same.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.920
Never mind. Don't want to know.
Just find the key.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.389
-Just like the Sorcerer's hat.
-Mmm.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.014
CRUELLA: James, is that you, darling?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.810
-Cruella.
-CRU ELLA: James?

14:16.898 --> 14:18.229
-Go, I've got this.
-No, David.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.807
No, she thinks I'm him.
Go, go, go, go, go.

CRUELLA: Oh.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.863
I'm so glad you're here, James, darling.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.366
I've had a nasty fruitless day,

14:34.457 --> 14:36.573
and Mummy needs to unwind.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.168
I'm sure you do.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.539
DAVID: Mmm.

BOTH: Mmm.

(CRUELLA SIGHS)

14:44.926 --> 14:49.761
So, Sheriff,
what would you like to try first?

14:50.515 --> 14:52.506
The champagne? Or me?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.059

REGINA: Please stop staring
at the door.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.898
When your parents walk through it,
I promise I'll tell you.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.522
Maybe this was a bad idea.
I should have gone with them.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.446
Would you relax?
People are starting to stare at us.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.739
Remember what Liam said.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.783
-We need to act casual.
-(SIGHS)

15:13.496 --> 15:16.078
Yeah, what do you think
of Liam anyway?

15:16.165 --> 15:17.951
You don't think
he's a little self-righteous, do you?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.657
He doesn't like you, does he?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.458
He doesn't think
I'm good enough for Hook.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.086
(SCOFFS) To be honest,
you're too good for Hook.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.505
He's different with Liam.
It's like he thinks he walks on water.

15:26.801 --> 15:27.836
What's going on?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.176
Liam thinks I should let Hook move on.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.879
Who cares what Liam thinks?
What does Hook think?

15:32.974 --> 15:33.963
He agrees.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.683
Well, that's because
he hasn't forgiven himself.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.805
How do you know that?

15:38.896 --> 15:41.763
Though I hate to admit it,
we're much alike.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.354
And forgiving yourself
is the hardest thing to do.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.810
You want to help Hook,

15:46.863 --> 15:48.603
-help him with that.
-(DOOR CHIMES)

15:50.700 --> 15:53.942
Moms, Grandma found the key.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.789
HOOK: The mansion is here.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.204
I guess ol' White Beard
was telling the truth.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.711
Do we have the key?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.882
We have it, but there's
a protection spell on the door.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.550
Could be dangerous to open it.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.798
Right. Well, I suppose
I should do the honors.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.597
I've been dead the longest.
I'd say l have the least to lose.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.141

weren't you?

I'm sorry I dragged you into this voyage.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.264
Are you aware this ship is pointed
dead into a storm?

16:59.435 --> 17:02.848
Back to the rigging, Jones.
Leave the navigation to the officers.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.055
Your officers are doing a piss poorjob.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.274
We're 30 degrees off course,
headed into a hurricane.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.319
We're aware. Carry on.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.531
Are you mad?

17:12.615 --> 17:14.731
What kind of captain
sails into a hurricane?

17:14.825 --> 17:17.953
The kind that earns his namesake.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.279
The King offered a mighty reward
for what's inside that storm.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.787
This voyage was never
about the grain in the hold, was it?

17:24.877 --> 17:28.369
You're going after that cursed sapphire.
"The Eye of the Storm."

17:28.464 --> 17:29.624
So you've heard of it.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.966
Every sailor's heard of it.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.542
Countless men have sailed into that
storm looking for that bloody stone,

17:34.637 --> 17:36.002
but none have survived.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.213
If you don't like how I run my ship,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.298
you should have left
when you had the chance.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.681
Now move along,
before I string you up for mutiny.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.856
Easy, Captain. l have always
abhorred the idea of mutiny.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.103
But if that's what it takes
to save these men, then so be it.

Or the bloody way?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.587
and plot a course
out of this bloody typhoon.

into a storm.

in your dungeon.

Oh, boo.

Couldn't you have pretended to be
Jimmy a little while longer?

21:03.721 --> 21:05.507
Wait. You mean, all this time you knew?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.680
Well, of course I knew.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.847
I mean, you might look like him,

21:08.934 --> 21:12.552
but you have none of his
unique, delicious damage.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.726
And what damage is that?

21:13.814 --> 21:15.350
The damage you're
responsible for, darling.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.227

21:17.318 --> 21:19.434
Oh, sure you have.

curled up safe in your mummy's arms.

of you went to live with the King

21:28.412 --> 21:29.822
and who stayed with her.

21:29.914 --> 21:33.998
She had to pick her favorite.
And she picked you.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.540
That is not my fault.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.539
Well, your brother disagrees.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.293

wondering why you and not him.

the answers for him, okay?

I tore my story out of Henry's book

22:12.039 --> 22:14.121
so he wouldn't know
I was the Evil Queen.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.573

22:15.668 --> 22:18.205
we don't stand much chance
of finding it.

What do you think, Liam?

22:19.839 --> 22:20.954
You found the book.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.380
Was there any evidence
it had been tampered with?

22:23.467 --> 22:27.176
No. And until I find any,
I'll choose to have hope.

Those pages could have fallen out
and still be in this house.

without trying to find them.

That's preposterous.
My brother wouldn't lie.

you don't know.

his unfinished business is down here.

25:13.929 --> 25:19.299
You agree to let this ship sink
like I want,

25:19.393 --> 25:21.349

I'll even throw in this.

25:30.863 --> 25:31.943
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

25:34.950 --> 25:36.315
It's the Eye of the Storm.

25:36.410 --> 25:40.278
You deliver this to your king
and he'll give you anything you want.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.988
Including that Navy job
you've always wanted.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.166
Your dreams can be fulfilled.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.564
EMMA: Find anything out here?

26:14.907 --> 26:16.272
Emma.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.032
I'm afraid a ship's captain
can only be cooped up for so long.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.990
I had to come out and get some air.
What brings you here?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.782
-I wanted to show you this.
-Ah.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.869
It's the ring I gave Killian.
I noticed he wasn't wearing it.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.874
Because he gave it to me.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.339
And you know what he told me
when he did?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.508
That it belonged to a much better man
than him.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.174
You're his hero.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.593
He doesn't think you can do any wrong.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.845
Which is why I can't figure out
why you would lie to him.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.938
HOOK: Liam, Emma, what's going on?

26:51.777 --> 26:52.892
She thinks I lied to you.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.726
He took the pages. I can prove it.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.985
Ask him to show you his hands.
He's been hiding them since I got here.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.613
Look, if it would help to clear things up,
I'd be happy to.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.829
That won't be necessary.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.867
I don't need proof to know
what's really going on here.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.248
Emma, when are you gonna admit
that this isn't really about my brother?

27:08.335 --> 27:11.122
What else would you think
it was about?

27:11.213 --> 27:12.874
Us.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.964
You think if you can prove
that Liam is a villain,

27:16.051 --> 27:18.087
then I'll somehow feel
like I was less of one.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.460
Then you can convince me
I'm worth saving

27:20.556 --> 27:22.547
and that we've got a future together.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.630
You agree with him?

27:23.725 --> 27:26.182
Why bring me back
if I should just move on?

27:27.187 --> 27:30.679
After we defeat Hades,
I won't be returning with you.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.358
My fate isn't in Storybrooke.
It should be determined here.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.479
EMMA: It doesn't have to be.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.981
You can come home.
You just have to forgive yourself.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.484
Thing is,

27:45.122 --> 27:48.535
no matter how many times | tell you,
or anybody else does,

27:51.378 --> 27:52.993
you have to do it yourself.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.371
Emma!

27:56.425 --> 27:58.586
Let her go, Killian. It's for the best.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.210
Your hand. You are hiding something.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.590
It's nothing.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.222
It's ink from the pages. Emma was right.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.642
Why would you lie to me?

28:08.729 --> 28:13.519
Because he's got much bigger secrets
than what's in some book.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.021
Like the truth about what he did to us.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.151
(THUNDER CRACKING)

28:26.246 --> 28:28.111
The storm is upon us, men!

28:29.958 --> 28:31.664
Brace the mainsail! Hurry!

28:33.503 --> 28:35.585
Look alive for your captain, men!

28:35.923 --> 28:37.459
You're just in time.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.050
We can't take this battering
much longer.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.671
What course should I have
the men chart?

28:43.680 --> 28:46.467
Continue on our present course.
Dead ahead.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.639
Into the storm?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.183
I'm afraid we've no choice.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.437
According to Silver's charts, there's
rocky shoals on either side of us.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.603
Trying to turn her around in these winds
would tear us apart.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.724
Are you sure?

28:57.819 --> 28:59.320
I need your trust, brother.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.365
I want you to have this.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.154
This is your lucky ring.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.987
The one that always
gets me home safe.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.035
That's how sure I am.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.325
KILLIAN: Men, my brother Liam
is a true hero!

29:17.589 --> 29:21.173
A better man and a better sailor
than I could ever wish to be!

29:22.469 --> 29:24.926
I would gladly trust him with my life!

29:25.013 --> 29:30.758
And if he says that there's a chance that
we can be saved, then he will save us!

29:31.270 --> 29:32.476
But we have to trust him.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.345
Are you with me?

29:34.481 --> 29:35.766
ALL: Aye!

29:35.857 --> 29:38.348
Then chart our course, dead ahead!

29:46.994 --> 29:48.109
What truth is he talking about, Liam?

29:48.662 --> 29:51.369
What does it have to do
with those missing pages?

29:51.498 --> 29:54.661
Your brother is not the hero
he pretends to be.

29:55.794 --> 30:00.208
I found that out when I stopped
by his tavern for my usual drink.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.962
He had a rather unexpected guest.

30:05.554 --> 30:06.634
Hades.

30:07.389 --> 30:11.348
He traded our souls
for the Eye of the Storm.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.051
Hades threatened to reveal the truth

30:14.187 --> 30:17.395
unless your brother destroyed
the pages from that book.

30:17.482 --> 30:22.192
Liam, please tell me
there's another explanation for this.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.695
I'm sorry, Killian,
but I didn't have any other choice.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.027
I had to do what I could
in order to save us.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.032
You lied to me.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.573
And now you're both going to pay. Men!

30:34.124 --> 30:35.239
(GRUNHNG)

30:47.179 --> 30:48.885
You can remove them now.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.227
It's time to walk the plank.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.853
I'll gladly walk it.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.852
Just spare Killian, please.
He has nothing to do with this.

31:01.943 --> 31:05.185
He should have gone down
along with the ship like the rest of us.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.526
And now he finally will.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.366
I'm sorry, Killian.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.863
I wanted to be
this perfect example for you.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.123
To inspire you.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.709
What you did was raise the bar so high,

31:21.797 --> 31:23.458
the only thing I could do was fail.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.958
No more talking!

31:25.926 --> 31:27.882
Time to face justice, boys!

31:27.969 --> 31:29.095
(LAUGHTER)

31:33.141 --> 31:36.804
Did someone decide to have a party
and forget to invite me?

31:38.772 --> 31:39.807
Lord...

31:40.482 --> 31:41.471
Lord Hades.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.478
-(BLOWS)
-(CAPTAIN SILVER YELLS)

31:44.069 --> 31:45.184
(CHUCKLES)

31:45.278 --> 31:48.236
And now for the Brothers Jones.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.907
One of them kept up his end
of our bargain and gets to live.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.827
While the other escaped my dungeon,

31:55.914 --> 31:58.997
and for that he has to pay.

31:59.126 --> 32:02.493
At last we'll see the end
of Captain Hook.

32:02.629 --> 32:06.463
And this time,
you won't be able to protect him.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.082
LIAM: No.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.256
I won't let you hurt Killian,

32:11.346 --> 32:12.847
no matter what kind of deal we made.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.006
Fine. Have it your way. (BLOWS)

32:17.352 --> 32:18.967
HOOK: No!

32:29.364 --> 32:30.524
I'm sorry, brother.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.355
Can you forgive me for what I've done?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.778
Yes, but that's not what's important.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.781
You need to find a way
to forgive yourself.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.988
I can't. Not after what I did to you.

32:39.207 --> 32:42.040
The only way to make amends
is for me to pay the price.

32:42.169 --> 32:44.330
No. No! Liam!

32:55.432 --> 32:56.421
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

32:56.558 --> 32:57.547
No!

32:58.727 --> 33:00.137
What's happening?

33:00.896 --> 33:02.557
You will pay for this.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.577
Liam.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.835
You're safe.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.840
Yes. It appears I am. (CHUCKLES)

33:36.348 --> 33:39.681
I suppose this is the sacrifice
I should have made long ago.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.434
And now I can finally depart.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.772
Then go.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.100
All of you.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.269
Now that you finally know the truth,

33:52.364 --> 33:54.901
your unfinished business
is complete as well.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.530
Get on board, men.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.037
What about you, brother?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.961
My unfinished business isn't done yet.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.964
Not until Emma and l
have defeated Hades.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.804
Tell her I'm sorry and l was wrong.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.142
She does want what's best for you.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.811
And don't worry about
reaching that bar anymore, Killian.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.980
You've become a true hero in a way
I never could.

34:34.990 --> 34:35.979
Good bye.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.611
Good bye, brother.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.309
(COUGHING)

35:05.020 --> 35:06.180
(GRUNHNG)

35:08.565 --> 35:09.805
MAN: Ahoy there!

35:10.692 --> 35:13.855
By the King's name,
what happened to you two sailors?

35:13.903 --> 35:18.146
We're survivors of the tempest
that plagues these waters.

35:18.199 --> 35:19.405
Let me guess.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.650
You went in search
of the Eye of the Storm?

35:22.203 --> 35:25.195
If you ask me,
you got what you deserved.

35:25.332 --> 35:29.200
You may be right,
but that gem is no legend.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.625
(PANTING)

35:34.090 --> 35:35.250
You found it.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.051
But how?

35:37.510 --> 35:39.501
In the bedlam my brother
was knocked unconscious.

35:40.430 --> 35:44.048
I managed to swim us
to a few planks of wood.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.385
Providence did the rest.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.553
Young man, your brother is a hero.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.225
My ship will bring you to the King,

35:51.274 --> 35:53.936
who has offered a great reward
for this stone.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.685
LIAM: We do not seek wealth.
Only honor.

35:57.072 --> 36:00.189
Perhaps His Majesty might grant us
a naval commission.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.027
Why wait for the King?

36:02.077 --> 36:06.116
I would be honored to offer you both
commissions on my ship.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.704
She's the flagship of the Royal Navy.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.241
She's very pretty. What's her name?

36:11.628 --> 36:13.243
The Jewel of the Realm.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.926
Thank you, Liam.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.964
For being the hero
that | always wished to be.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.427
I won't squander the second chance
you've given me.

36:31.648 --> 36:32.854
(BOTH LAUGH)

36:44.285 --> 36:46.071
Hook, where the hell have you been?

36:46.121 --> 36:48.578
First you and Liam left,
then Henry ran off somewhere.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.740
I'm sorry, Emma.
You were right about Liam.

36:51.793 --> 36:55.411
He destroyed those pages because of
a deal he made with Hades years ago.

36:55.463 --> 36:58.751
A deal that almost got us thrown
into the Boiling Sea.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.166
Are you okay? Where is he?

37:03.513 --> 37:05.344
He, uh, sacrificed himself.

37:06.933 --> 37:10.266
But his sacrifice helped a crew
we once sailed with.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.139
They finally moved on, thanks to him.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.309
Did he move on, too?

37:15.442 --> 37:16.648
He did.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.811
But he helped me see the truth
before he went.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.655
I'm glad you came down here, Emma.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.612
Perhaps I do deserve saving, after all.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.661
Does that mean when this is all over
you're planning to come home?

37:30.790 --> 37:31.996
Yes.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.326
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:33.793 --> 37:37.160
Everything Liam did was
to ensure that I had a future.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.669
And | damn well intend to have one.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.070
There's nothing in this entire book
about Hades.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.735
Liam ripped out every page.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.400
On behalf of my brother, I'm sorry.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.239
Maybe there's something else in here
that can help us.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.244
Our storybook had
all kinds of secrets in it.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.373
Well, Henry's kind of the expert
on storybooks. Where is he?

38:57.418 --> 38:59.579
He's upstairs going full emo teenager.

38:59.629 --> 39:02.041
And doesn't want to talk to anyone
right now.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.548
Well, maybe he just doesn't
want to talk to his mothers.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.264
Hey there.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.894
What's my favorite grandson up to?

39:19.107 --> 39:22.099
Nothing. Just thinking.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.939
Mind if I think with you?

39:28.992 --> 39:30.107
(DAVID SIGHS)

39:31.327 --> 39:34.319
So, what are we thinking about?

39:34.998 --> 39:36.613
I don't want to talk about it.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.122
Okay.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.408
Let's talk about me.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.954
(SIGHS) I had a pretty bad day today.

39:46.634 --> 39:50.843
I learned that my twin brother
resented me his whole life.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.013
I thought he grew up a prince.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.633
Guess he wanted something else.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.136
What I had. A loving mother.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.609
Please don't make this a lesson.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.187
Too late.

40:06.696 --> 40:12.157
See, some people would give anything
to have a family like yours, Henry.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.326
Because whatever's going on with you,

40:15.413 --> 40:18.029
you know you always have someone
you can talk to.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.998
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

40:21.544 --> 40:26.664
Or if you just wanna stay up here
and be a teenager, that's cool, too.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.677
Wait.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.059
I need to show you something.

40:40.438 --> 40:44.397
The Author's pen?
I thought you destroyed it.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.607
I did, but thatjust brought it here.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.856
The Apprentice told me where it was.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.863
I thought if I used its power,
I could be a hero.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.862
Henry, what made you think
you needed to do this?

40:55.244 --> 40:56.529
At first it was Cruella.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.449
She wanted me to use it
to bring her back to life.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.539
Why would you help her?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.540
To help you.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.708
She said you have all this guilt
about killing her.

41:09.258 --> 41:12.295
And that's when I realized
I have all this power

41:12.387 --> 41:14.548
and I ignore it.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.050
ljust live in everyone's shadow.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.967
I want to be the hero
instead of the one the heroes rescue.

41:20.061 --> 41:24.100
I understand that,
but that's not the way to do it.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.769
I know,
and that's why I'm telling you now.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.392
I finally understand
what the Apprentice meant.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.777
I'm going to write the stories
as they are,

41:31.906 --> 41:33.237
and I'll start with Hades.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.111
I'm going to use the pen
the correct way.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.825
To recreate his story.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.824
Hades went to a lot of trouble
to keep us from learning his story.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.576
Which means we're onto something.

41:42.917 --> 41:46.580
The question is,
what is Hades trying to hide from us?

42:00.601 --> 42:01.590
(SIGHING)

42:15.616 --> 42:17.277
Zelena,

42:18.619 --> 42:21.281
our secret remains safe.
