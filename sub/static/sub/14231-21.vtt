01:11.821 --> 01:13.323
[arf]

01:13.406 --> 01:17.827
How can you think of food
when my business is-- what?

01:17.911 --> 01:19.621
That can't be right.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.415
Oh...

01:22.499 --> 01:25.752
It's all on account of that
lousy low down loathsome

01:25.835 --> 01:27.587
Earl's Auto!

01:27.671 --> 01:30.006
They sell cars at rock-bottom prices.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.801
They're even honest with their customers!

01:32.884 --> 01:36.012
How's a guy supposed to compete
with slimeball tactics like that!

01:36.096 --> 01:37.764
[whimpers]

01:37.847 --> 01:39.182
[man] Um, excuse me.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.437
Feast your eyes on this brand-new
used compact.

01:44.521 --> 01:49.526
With fully automatic manual transmission
and original Florida air in the tires!

01:51.194 --> 01:53.655
Or how about this red-hot baby?

01:53.738 --> 01:56.533
Genuine Argentine polyester seats.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.785
Gets 32 gallons to the mile, city.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.912
Sign here and we'll fill in
the price later.

02:00.995 --> 02:05.041
Uh, actually, all I wanted
was directions to Earl's Auto.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.793
Earl's Auto?

02:06.876 --> 02:09.462
Oh, no, never mind.
I see it right there.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.715
Oh, don't go!

02:11.798 --> 02:15.135
I'll throw in a free car air freshener!

02:17.053 --> 02:22.267
If I don't do something soon,
I'm gonna be looking for a new job.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
What the--

02:26.229 --> 02:28.148
"employment opportunities"?

02:28.231 --> 02:29.399
Boy...

02:29.482 --> 02:32.402
"City inspector wanted."

02:32.736 --> 02:34.863
Hmm...

02:36.156 --> 02:39.659
If I could get just the right sap
named inspector,

02:39.743 --> 02:43.163
he could shut down Earl's car lot for me.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.707
Course, it'd have to be somebody
easy to manipulate

02:45.790 --> 02:49.336
somebody on the shady side of stupid,
a class-a, brainless--

02:49.419 --> 02:50.503
Hiya, Pete!

02:50.587 --> 02:52.964
Ya got a nickel for the parking meter?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.466
Topeka!

02:54.549 --> 02:56.593
Wouldn't want to get a ticket or, uh--

02:56.676 --> 02:58.762
Hyuck! Never mind.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.931
Hyuck! Gawrsh, I forgot.
I walked.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.225
Goofy, you're perfect.

03:04.309 --> 03:08.772
Aw, shucks, Pete. Hyuck!
You're not too bad yourself.

03:08.855 --> 03:13.777
Goofer, has anyone ever told you
how observatory you are?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.529
Hmm... not that I've noticed.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.697
Well, it's true!

03:17.781 --> 03:21.701
Like how quick you picked up
on not bringing your car with ya.

03:21.785 --> 03:25.288
Aw, that was one of my finer moments.

03:25.413 --> 03:30.168
You oughta find a job where you can use
those amazing skills of yours.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.295
Uh, what skills?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.549
[Goofy] I don't know anything
about inspectoratin'.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.343
Well, what's to know?

03:38.426 --> 03:40.595
You inspect a business, write 'em tickets.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.806
Sounds awful complicated.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.434
You could use the extra cash,
couldn't you?

03:46.518 --> 03:51.564
Don't ya want to make enough money
to send your poor dumb son to college

03:51.648 --> 03:54.693
and make him something better
than you could ever be?

03:55.527 --> 03:58.279
Gawrsh. When you put it
like that...

03:58.363 --> 04:00.365
Goof, you're a shoo-in for the job.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.575
Oh, if you say so, Pete.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.370
[Pete] Howdy. I found you
the perfect inspector.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.622
Goofy was made for the job.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.332
He's honest, hard working,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.419
knows most of the alphabet,
smart as a whip.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.838
How d'ya work this doohickey?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.340
Hmm... Must be defective.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.343
Sure, he seems a little slow
on the outside,

04:20.427 --> 04:22.679
but that's 'cause the gears
are always turnin' on the inside!

04:22.762 --> 04:26.141
Did I mention that he
has an open mind, too?

04:26.683 --> 04:29.769
Keeps my head nice and cool
in the summer.

04:30.186 --> 04:35.025
I-I don't know if your friend
has the necessary qualifications

04:35.108 --> 04:37.027
for a government position.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.030
Maybe you should look
a little closer at his resume.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.406
Green...

04:41.489 --> 04:42.449
Fresh...

04:43.033 --> 04:44.576
Yours.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.038
You think you can bribe
a high ranking public official

04:48.121 --> 04:51.374
who has senatorial ambitions?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.379
Can he spell his own name?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.380
Multiple choice?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.590
He's hired.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.300
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:00.383 --> 05:06.097
Now, the most important quality
of an inspector is his lack of mercy,

05:06.181 --> 05:10.018
especially to putrid, lowlife,
pond-suckin' used car salesmen.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.271
But, uh, aren't you a putrid, lowlife,

05:13.355 --> 05:15.440
pond-suckin' used car salesman?

05:15.523 --> 05:16.608
Exception to the rule.

05:16.691 --> 05:21.279
Remember, no matter how much they beg
and plead for you to let 'em off,

05:21.363 --> 05:22.364
you never listen to 'em.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.283
An inspector never plays favorites.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.619
But, uh, what if they're innocent?

05:27.702 --> 05:30.622
A used car salesman's never innocent!

05:30.705 --> 05:32.791
Except for me, of course.

05:33.375 --> 05:36.211
Now, if you find a smudge on
a car windshield, what do you do?

05:37.504 --> 05:38.797
Write him up?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.132
If you find dust on the hood?

05:41.216 --> 05:44.386
[coughing] Throw the book at him?

05:44.469 --> 05:47.347
If you can't see your face
in the exhaust pipe?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.808
Whaddaya do, whaddaya do,
whaddaya do?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.226
I don't know!

05:51.309 --> 05:53.186
You don't know
or you don't want to know?

05:53.269 --> 05:54.938
I-- I confess!

05:55.021 --> 05:56.106
I did it!

05:56.189 --> 05:58.608
I ate the strawberries!

05:58.733 --> 06:00.819
[sobbing]

06:01.486 --> 06:02.696
Ten-hut!

06:02.779 --> 06:05.615
Chest out! Gut in!
Tuck in those chins, soldier!

06:07.742 --> 06:11.579
It's a war out there, Goof,
and you're the front line troop, see?

06:11.663 --> 06:15.500
So go out there,
and do us law-abiding citizens proud!

06:16.418 --> 06:18.169
Let's say you start with, um,

06:18.253 --> 06:21.631
oh... Earl's Auto.

06:23.425 --> 06:28.263
Here's a few extra citation pads, pal,
in case you need 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.515
Gawrsh. Don't know how to thank you.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.184
[coughing] That's OK, pal.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.437
Always glad to help.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.025
That's really not necessary.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.988
Don't you worry, pal.
I promise I'll make you proud!

06:47.282 --> 06:49.451
Why, you stupid lame brain!

06:50.118 --> 06:52.203
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

06:52.287 --> 06:55.915
You're the best pal a pal ever had, pal!

06:57.042 --> 06:58.877
Thanks, pal.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.467
Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

07:06.551 --> 07:09.721
[making airplane noises]

07:09.804 --> 07:11.306
Ha-ha-ha!

07:11.389 --> 07:14.142
Now, how about some more
mashed potatoes, pal?

07:14.225 --> 07:15.685
OK, pal! Hyuck!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.396
I think my hangar still
has some room in it!

07:18.480 --> 07:19.981
Ah-hyuck!

07:20.065 --> 07:23.401
I can't believe what I'm seeing,
bunny eyes!

07:23.485 --> 07:27.155
You're kind, you're considerate,
you're polite. [chuckles]

07:27.238 --> 07:28.198
What are you up to?

07:28.281 --> 07:32.994
What makes you think I'm up to anything,
Puppy Toes?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.164
Oh! Oopsy!

07:36.247 --> 07:40.710
My buddy got some gravy
on him's chinny-chin-chin!

07:41.336 --> 07:43.171
Maybe it's not Daddy!

07:43.254 --> 07:47.092
Maybe it's one of the cucumber pods
planted on Earth for an invasion!

07:47.175 --> 07:49.135
Oh, what's the big deal here?

07:49.219 --> 07:52.222
I made Goof a little celebration dinner,
that's all.

07:52.347 --> 07:58.353
Why, it's not every day my very best pal
in the whole world gets made inspector

07:58.645 --> 08:00.397
and shuts down Earl's Auto.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.065
Heh-heh-heh.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.569
I shoulda known you were acting good
because you're up to no good!

08:06.653 --> 08:09.948
But Pete, I didn't shut down Earl's Auto.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.326
That's my Goof.
I knew I could count--

08:13.410 --> 08:15.829
What do you mean?
How many citations did you write him?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.498
Oh, uh, let's see.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.667
-One, two...
-Yeah. Yeah.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.502
-Three, four...
-Yeah. Yeah.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.087
-None!
-What?

08:24.170 --> 08:27.424
Nope, didn't write a single one.
Earl passed with flying colors.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.550
What?

08:33.221 --> 08:37.142
Mm. That salad dressing doesn't have
much kick to it, does it?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.602
Oh. I'll give you a kick...

08:39.686 --> 08:41.104
Right out the window!

08:41.187 --> 08:44.315
You're not throwing Goof
through that window!

08:44.399 --> 08:46.985
I'm not, Possum Lips?

08:47.736 --> 08:48.695
No!

08:50.405 --> 08:53.825
Wha-ha-hooeey!

08:58.371 --> 09:00.790
Not one customer in a month.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.584
How could things get any worse?

09:02.667 --> 09:03.710
[siren blaring]

09:03.793 --> 09:06.004
Well, yeah, that's one way.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.511
Oh, gonna have to get
those brakes inspected.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.680
What are you doin' here?

09:16.431 --> 09:19.100
Oh, I just dropped by
to inspect your business.

09:19.184 --> 09:22.520
Oh, not a moment too soon.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.610
Whoa ho ho!
Now, come on, Goof old pal.

09:28.693 --> 09:33.198
You're not gonna inspect your very best
friend in the whole world, are you?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.407
Pal.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.620
Well, it's like you said,
"an inspector never plays favorites."

09:38.745 --> 09:41.247
Wouldn't wanna let ya down
by not doin' my job.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.335
Oh, have a little mercy, why don't ya.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.881
Uh-uh. Like you said,
"An inspector never shows mercy."

09:50.507 --> 09:52.258
Please, please, please.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.302
Don't make me beg.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.221
You also said not to listen.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.807
Will you stop doin' what I said
and do what I say!

09:58.890 --> 10:03.478
Oh, I see what you're doin'.
Oh, you're testin' me.

10:03.561 --> 10:08.316
I am not testin' you,
you stupid lame-brain moron!

10:08.775 --> 10:11.903
Oh, don't worry. I won't let ya down.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.158
No engine.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.952
But think of the gas you'll save.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.664
No rearview mirror.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.000
Like I always say, "Never look back."

10:26.042 --> 10:27.961
No windshield.

10:29.254 --> 10:33.341
But pickin' bugs off your teeth
can be a real challenge.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.971
Hate when that happens.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.182
[sizzles]

10:45.186 --> 10:48.898
Look, I'm not payin' these
stupid tickets, see!

10:48.982 --> 10:50.442
So whaddaya have to say about that?

10:50.525 --> 10:51.943
Just one thing.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.446
What?

10:54.529 --> 10:56.698
Gonna have to shut you down.

11:09.002 --> 11:13.298
If I never see that stupid grin again,
it'll be too soon.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.469
Hiya, Pete. Got great news.

11:17.552 --> 11:23.224
You got a lotta glands steppin' foot
in my house after what you did.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.227
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do it.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.230
I'll never again. What'd I do?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.900
You shut down my car lot,
you lame brain!

11:31.983 --> 11:34.736
Yup, and thanks to you, Pete my pal,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.405
I've been named employee of the month.

11:37.489 --> 11:41.117

Whoa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:45.497 --> 11:49.250

12:15.694 --> 12:17.862
Yes, Dolphin Lips.

and hash browns, and turkey casserole.

Ooh, you know what I like.

I'm sorry, honey, but you know Daddy's not
allowed to eat anything from the house.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.553
It's against the law.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.057
Here, Poopsie,
you're gonna be late for work.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.559
You don't wanna miss rush-hour traffic.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.229
That does it! I quit!

16:19.312 --> 16:21.398
I'm sick of washin' windshields.

16:21.481 --> 16:25.652
But if you don't work,
how will you get your car lot back?

16:25.735 --> 16:28.405
Well, we could sell Pistol to the circus.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.989
I heard that, buster.

16:30.073 --> 16:34.035
Nobody's sellin' anybody--
What kind of money we talkin'?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.497
We could have another--
oh, never mind.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.082
I'll find a way out of this.

16:39.499 --> 16:45.005
If I made inspector lamebrain,
I can break him, too.

16:45.714 --> 16:49.968
Goof, I wanna give you some advice,
man-to-man, pal-to-pal.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.511
Coast-to-coast?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.930
Your problem is you've been too nice.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.432
You gotta get tough.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.433
Tough.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.851
You gotta get ruthless.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.103
How many O's in "ruthless"?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.856
But first, you gotta get brutal.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.192
Remember, there's nuthin'
a boss respects more

17:06.276 --> 17:10.280
than for one of his uppity underlings
to cite him.

17:10.363 --> 17:14.451
You mean I should give citations
to the chief inspector?

17:14.534 --> 17:18.705
Oh...what a terrific idea.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.543
Sorry, sir,

17:23.626 --> 17:26.046
but your serial numbers are out of order.

18:17.180 --> 18:21.101
Goof, I think you're beginning to get
the hang of this.

18:21.184 --> 18:27.190

of any inspector is takin' a bribe.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.745
Would I do anything illegal?

18:40.829 --> 18:44.165
