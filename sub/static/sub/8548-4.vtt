01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:39.224
Hi, Carl. Where's Laura?

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:40.862
She's at the library.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.658
That's okay. I'll talk to her later.

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:47.895
- You're not gonna eat that, are you, Carl?
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.931
Do you know what's in that baby?

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.939
Guar gum, Red Dye Number 5...

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:57.340
...and enough cholesterol
to clog up your arteries...

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:00.607
...like a drain full of greasy hair.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.414
Once again, you've come between me...

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:07.021
...and the things that I love.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:12.219
Works every time.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:39.014
And now we're over St. Louis. Drrrrr.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:42.778
Now we see Chicago. Nrrrrrr.

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.446
Carl, the baby just ate.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:49.284
Uh-oh. Emergency landing.
Emergency landing.

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:55.560
I could never play airplane
with your Uncle Carl.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.895
He was a 747 from the day he was born.

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.361
As I recall, Mama...

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:06.633
...I was a normal 10 pounds,
5 ounces of pure joy.

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:12.611
Uh-huh. And as I recall,
you were 36 hours of hard labor.

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:16.584
He's still a wide body,
but it's all first class.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.955
Mama? Harriette and I are finally gonna get
a chance to go to dinner and a movie alone.

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.286
Well, don't go to one of them
slasher movies.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.659
You know how they give you nightmares.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.158
You got that right.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:34.791
Every time he sees one,
he sleeps with the nightlight on.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.337
Well, what's wrong with that?

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:40.600
Carl, it's got a 200-watt bulb.

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.769
- He will not.
- Will to.

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.142
Laura, there's no way.

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.984
Michael is to gonna ask me out.

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.211
There's no way he's gonna ask you out.

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:53.979
And do you know why?

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.090
Because you're a geek.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:59.785
Oh, geek. That's a new word for you.
Can you spell it?

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.528
I could if I wanted to.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.762
There's our ride.

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:10.500
- Have fun, girls.
- Hey, and you two try to get some sleep.

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.770
Dad, it's a slumber party.

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:14.966
Why would anybody sleep?

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:16.406
All right. Be good.

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:20.014
Remember to say please and thank you.
Laura, don't cut your sister's hair.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.547
Okay, Mom.

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:23.844
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:29.052
Harriette, tonight is gonna be great.

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.486
First a movie...

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:33.822
...then a romantic dinner
at Chez Josephine.

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.361
They're holding our table.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.930
And then home.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.791
Oh, I love it
when the kids go on sleepovers.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.026
Oh, yeah.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.728
- So let's hurry and go so we can hurry back.
- Yeah.

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:50.937
Hello?

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:52.740
Oh, yes, she's here. Hold on.

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:56.909
Rachel! Telephone!

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.053
It's that guy from the choir.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:02.019
He's never gonna give up.
Last Sunday, he asked her out.

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.725
Rachel!

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.527
Maybe she'll start going out with him
instead of tagging along behind us.

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:11.165
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.098
- Alan Smith.
- Oh.

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:15.896
Give that...

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.601
Hello? Oh, hi, Alan.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:24.101
A movie? Oh, no, I can't.
I've got a million things to do tonight.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.213
Yeah. Thanks for asking, though.

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:29.009
- Okay. Bye.
- Well, good night, Rachel.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.448
- Where are you going?
- Oh, just to a movie.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.281
I'd love to go to a movie.

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.288
I've got nothing to do.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:39.450
I'll just ask Mother Winslow
if she'll watch little Richie.

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:45.623
Harriette.
Now, you know I love your sister.

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:49.037
I cannot remember the last time
you and I went out by ourselves.

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.865
Rachel always wants to come with us.

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:54.008
Well, you're the one
who didn't want her sitting home alone.

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.701
I know how hard it was for her
losing her husband...

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.480
...but it's been almost a year and a half.

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:04.017
At some point, she's got to start going out
with other people. Anybody other than us.

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:06.518
I know, but I'm not gonna push her.

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:11.483
A little push is not such a bad thing
and that Alan seems like a really great guy.

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:13.293
Who's a great guy?

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.430
Uh, Eddie Murphy.

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:18.994
We were trying to decide
whether to see a comedy or a love story.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:22.432
Oh, well, I'm always up for romance.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:24.964
So was I.

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:38.109
I mean, did we have fun or what?

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:42.553
And I am so glad we got our table.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:45.418
Yeah, another great family outing.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.858
Just the three of us.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.897
Well, look, I'm gonna go upstairs
and check on Richie.

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.296
Thanks again, guys.

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:58.731
You know, Harriette,
I've had better dates.

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.431
Carl, it wasn't that bad.

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.008
It was terrible!

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.509
She not only ruined our romantic dinner...

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.739
...she sat right between us
at the movies.

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:11.147
And if there's one thing I hate,
it's three hands in my popcorn tub.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:16.284
Carl, two of them were yours.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.691
We gotta talk to her, Harriette.

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:26.232
I know, but it's not exactly
an easy thing to talk about.

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:27.732
I don't know if I can do it.

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:30.463
Well, then let me do it.
After all, I am a cop.

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.800
Being tactful is part of my job.

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:34.272
Let's deal with it tomorrow.

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.173
- Tonight is ours.
- Yeah.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:43.880
Well, Richie's sound asleep
and guess what's on TV.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.818
<i>The Elephant Man.</i>

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.613
I love that movie.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:52.726
All right, that's it, Rachel. That's it.
We have got to talk.

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.195
This is bad news, isn't it?

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:59.294
No, no, no. It's just a tiny little thing
barely worth mentioning.

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:02.904
Rachel, you gotta start dating again.
You're driving us nuts.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.830
Thank you, Officer Tact.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.373
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm in the way?

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:15.141
No, Rachel. We're concerned about you.
You ought to start seeing other people.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:17.308
Single men-type people.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.655
Well, for your information,
I plan to start dating again.

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.688
Any idea when that might be?

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:29.459
Not that we're pushing you.

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.189
Well...

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.891
...there's nobody I'm interested in dating
right now.

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:36.833
Well, what about Alan?

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.903
Yeah, he's definitely interested.

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:43.203
And at choir practice,
he's always holding your hymnal.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:45.312
Yeah.

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:47.507
Well, look...

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:50.207
...if it means so much to you
for me to date...

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:52.979
...then the next time Alan calls,
I'll say yes, okay?

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:55.055
Well, that's great. Thanks.

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:58.886
<i>Right now, I have a date
with The Elephant Man.</i>

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:01.655
- Good night.
- Night.

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:08.061
Are you sure you're not the Alan Smith
who sings with the First Baptist Choir?

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:09.362
No?

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:13.998
Well, sorry. You don't win anything,
but thanks for playing our game.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.910
Carl, stop this foolishness.
Alan will call when he's ready.

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:23.347
Harriette, it's been almost a week.
I'm telling you, he's given up.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.543
The man needs a little encouragement.

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:28.480
Hi.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.954
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.649
You know...

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:37.060
...I hate to brag,
but we are in the best shape of our lives.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.061
I can't believe
you make little Richie work out.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:43.796
Oh, honey, are you kidding?
This boy loves gym class. Watch this.

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:50.142
<i>Motorboat, motorboat
Oh, so slow</i>

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:53.907
<i>Motorboat, motorboat
Oh, so fast</i>

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:57.245
<i>Motorboat, motorboat
Put on the gas</i>

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:00.214
Okay, let's cool down.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.380
I'll get it.

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:08.023
Hello?

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:12.226
Oh, hi. How are you? Uh-huh.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.129
Hold on.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.526
- It's Alan.
- Alan?

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.366
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:24.976
Yes.

01:21:25.147 --> 01:21:28.514
It's Alan. It's Alan. It's Alan.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:32.346
Hi, Alan.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:35.112
I'm fine. How are you?

01:21:36.158 --> 01:21:38.718
Oh, I'd love to, but...

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:45.995
Okay. Uh-huh.

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:48.329
Uh-huh. Right.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.061
Bye.

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.165
What did he say?

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.402
We're going out to dinner on Tuesday.

01:21:58.246 --> 01:21:59.440
That's great.

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:02.048
Yeah, great.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.616
Are you okay?

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:06.379
I'm fine. It's just a date.

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:08.750
I'm gonna take the baby upstairs
for his bottle.

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:17.620
I know, I know. I forgot something.

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:26.472
When do you think she'll notice
she forgot the baby?

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:29.940
I think she'll notice
when she tries to burp the bag.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:46.016
What do you think?

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.957
It looks perfect.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.653
No, it's too sexy.

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:51.890
I don't want him to think I'm sexy.

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.535
Is it okay if he thinks you're a woman?

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:56.932
Not on the first date.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.672
Honey, relax.

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.400
Harriette...

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:04.477
...it's been too long.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.273
What do people do on dates now?

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:09.006
They do what they've always done.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:11.778
Oh, Harriette, that's not good.

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:16.623
Maybe this is a bad idea.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:19.055
Rachel,
you're just having dinner with him.

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:21.991
All you have to do is eat and talk.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:25.223
Just try not to do both of them
at the same time.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.702
A pair of fours.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.635
Read them and weep.

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:35.469
Not so fast, slick.

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.239
Full house, queens on the roof.

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:41.439
But that's impossible.

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:44.278
- You didn't draw any face cards.
- How would you know?

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.253
I assumed.

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:50.318
Dad, Eddie's been cheating.
He's using a marked deck.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:53.052
Well, it's not helping him much.

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:56.758
That's Aunt Rachel's date.

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:59.866
Put away those poker chips.
It looks like a casino in here.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.196
This chair is for company.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:08.198
Alan, come on in, come on in.
Good to see you.

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.276
- You remember Eddie and Laura?
- Of course.

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.811
Hi, Alan. How about a little poker?

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:16.974
Five-card stud? Lowball? Klondike?
What's your pleasure?

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:26.150
Laura, why don't you go
tell your Aunt Rachel that her date is here.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:29.456
Come on in. Rachel will be right down.

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:33.032
So where are you young people
going tonight?

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.226
We're having dinner at Chez Josephine.

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.803
That's my favorite place.
They love me there.

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:40.532
Mention my name.
It's the only way you'll get a table.

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:43.644
Thanks, but my family owns the place.

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:52.315
You look terrific.

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:53.681
Fantastic.

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.254
This is definitely the one.

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.618
Yellow is the perfect color for you.

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.453
You know, I think you're right.

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:01.527
I love this dress.

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:04.722
- He's here.
- I hate this dress.

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:06.631
What are you talking about?

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:09.099
- I look terrible.
- You look beautiful.

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:11.670
I look like a banana.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.365
- No, you don't.
- Well, she does a little bit.

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:20.414
Laura, your Aunt Rachel is a little nervous.
She needs a few more minutes.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:23.278
Now, go down and stall Alan
and don't tell anybody.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:27.444
- She looks like she's losing it to me, Mom.
- Go, go, go.

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:32.718
She'll be right down.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:36.261
- Dad, can I speak to you for a minute?
- Oh, excuse us.

01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:39.356
Aunt Rachel's getting cold feet.

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:42.469
I think this guy's as good as stood up.

01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:45.134
- You want me to break the news?
- No.

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:47.831
You stall while I go figure out
what's going on.

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.772
Is there something wrong with Rachel?

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:52.845
No. You know women.
They're like doctors.

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:56.211
They like to keep you waiting,
then they cost you an arm and a leg.

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:59.709
You know, doctors, waiting rooms,
you know?

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:01.446
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:02.954
I am a doctor.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:10.326
Allan, why don't you get to know the kids.
I'll go check on her.

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:14.459
I'll fix you a snack.
You're gonna be here a while.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.364
Wanna see a magic trick?

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:19.939
Say no.
He couldn't pull a rabbit out of a hutch.

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.774
She's just jealous because I'm so good.

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:25.504
Pick a card, any card.

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.346
Okay.

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:30.211
Your card is...

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.116
...two of hearts.
- No.

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:34.983
No?

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.986
Okay.

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:39.158
- Two of diamonds.
- Afraid not.

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:43.161
- Uh, two of spades?
- No.

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.925
- Two of clubs?
- No.

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.504
It's not a two, right?

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:53.904
You are good.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.037
Well, maybe.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:04.151
No maybe about it. That's the one.
It's you.

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:06.480
No. It's just not right.

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.315
Okay, Rachel, I've had it.

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:11.084
You've tried on every dress you own,
plus two of mine...

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:14.194
...plus the one Carl wears
when he works undercover.

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:21.498
I can't do it, okay?
I just can't go on this date.

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:22.693
You're not going?

01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:26.534
We left Alan down there with our kids.
He deserves something.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:32.208
Are you sure it's not the nine of hearts?

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.406
I wish it was.

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:39.377
Face it, Houdini. You stink.

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:44.488
We did it. We broke the record.

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:47.187
- Hello, Alan.
- Hi, Mrs. Winslow.

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:54.028
We sold 232 boxes of cookies
in one afternoon.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.032
Congratulations.

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.729
Oh, it was nothing.

01:27:58.907 --> 01:28:02.673
You know, they can say no
to a little old girl or no to a little old lady...

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:06.211
...but the combination gets them
every time.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.712
Oh, Alan, are you here to pick up Rachel?

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:13.449
Yes, but she's still upstairs.
I hope everything's all right.

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:16.522
I'll go see what's keeping her.

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:20.092
Okay. All right. I got it. I got it.

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.724
It's the six of clubs.

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.694
It's the eight of diamonds.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.327
That's it.

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:33.796
Rachel, couldn't you just go down
and sit in the car?

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:37.172
I'm sure once the night air hits you,
you'll be fine.

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:40.877
Carl, take it like a man. She's not going.

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.677
But, Harriette,
the man owns a restaurant.

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:47.453
How can I say this tactfully? Go.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.816
Mama, Rachel will not go on her date.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:55.792
Will you please tell her
she's got to go on her date?

01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:58.626
- Let me talk to her.
- Fine.

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.832
I mean alone.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.230
Excuse us.

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:12.441
Mother Winslow, I am so embarrassed.

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:15.742
That poor man has been sitting downstairs
all this time.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.909
Oh, honey, he'll be all right.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:22.056
What really matters is how you feel.

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:27.619
Well, I was fine until he got here
and then I just panicked.

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.319
I don't know what it is.

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:31.494
I do.

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:37.000
It's that the man waiting downstairs for you
is not your husband, Robert.

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:40.372
I wish it was.

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.133
I know.

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:46.746
You know, it's just so strange.

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:51.645
I mean, you meet a man
and you fall in love and get married.

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:54.253
And everything is perfect.

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:59.053
You get to where you know
what he's gonna say before he even says it.

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:02.256
And you laugh at the same things.

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:06.399
You even know which way
he's gonna turn in his sleep.

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:08.558
I know, sugar, I know.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.468
And you think...

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:15.635
...it's never gonna change.

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:21.541
But then it does...

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:25.709
...and everybody keeps telling you
you've gotta start over.

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:30.715
But starting over is so hard.

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:35.519
Rachel,
I know what you're going through.

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:39.531
I still think of my Sam
every day of my life.

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:43.464
Even after all these years?

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:46.530
He was a wonderful man...

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:49.700
...and I'll always love him.

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:53.572
And you will always love Robert.

01:30:57.785 --> 01:31:00.015
But I had to move on.

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:02.650
And so do you, honey.

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:06.960
Well, I'd like to do that...

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:09.155
...but I just...

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:12.831
I don't... I can't explain what I feel.

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:14.666
You feel guilty.

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.229
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.569
Rachel...

01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:25.736
...you haven't done anything
to feel guilty about.

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:30.179
And going out again is exactly
what Robert would want you to do.

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.315
You really think so?

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:36.480
I think he'd want you
to go on with your life, honey.

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:39.687
How do I do that?

01:31:41.129 --> 01:31:44.656
There's a nice young man
waiting downstairs for you.

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:49.068
Yeah, how do you know so much
about this stuff?

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:51.865
I mean, you didn't even date
after your husband died.

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:54.098
What makes you think that?

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.310
Carl never mentioned anybody.

01:31:58.746 --> 01:32:01.340
I don't tell Carl everything.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:06.249
He'd have a fit
if he knew his mother was a party animal.

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:12.423
<i>Stop in the name of love</i>

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:15.187
<i>Before you break my heart</i>

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:18.298
<i>Think it over</i>

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:21.367
<i>Think it over</i>

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.167
<i>Stop</i>

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:31.534
Thank you, thank you.
And for our next number, we'd like to do...

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:34.438
..."Proud Mary."

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.873
Sing "Melancholy Baby."

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.109
We don't know that one.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.745
I was counting on that.

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.688
Whoa.

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:50.292
Hi, Alan.

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:54.559
- I'm really sorry I kept you waiting so long.
- It was worth it.

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.703
You look terrific.

01:32:57.205 --> 01:32:59.036
Thank you.

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:01.274
What do we do now?

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:02.704
How about dinner?

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:04.678
Sounds like a great idea.

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:06.108
Would you mind?

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.776
We are going alone, aren't we?

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:16.214
Yes, I think we'll have more fun that way.

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.449
Thank you, all...

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:20.787
...for a fascinating evening.

01:33:21.863 --> 01:33:24.058
- Shall we?
- We sure shall.

01:33:24.232 --> 01:33:25.722
- Enjoy yourselves.
- I will.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.492
Bring home a doggy bag.

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:28.896
Have fun, you two.

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.004
Bye. Thanks.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.400
Well, since we're all here, hit it, Judy.

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.771
<i>Big wheels keep on turnin'</i>

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:40.539
<i>Proud Mary keep on burnin'</i>

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.046
<i>- Rollin'
- Rollin'</i>

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.979
<i>- Rollin'
- Rollin'</i>

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:52.215
Alone at last.

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:56.193
- My, how I do love this porch.
- Me too.

01:33:56.697 --> 01:34:00.428
But I love it more
when it's above 40 degrees.

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:02.068
Well, now, that's the best part.

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:04.796
You need me to keep you warm.

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:07.304
I need you for everything.

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:12.405
Hello there.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.070
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.944
I just wanted to let you guys know
I was home.

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:19.075
So how did it go with Alan?

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.679
It went fine.

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.323
So are we gonna see him again?

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.853
Maybe.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:29.295
- Go on.
- Oh, you go on.

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:33.890
Carl, there are certain things
a woman likes to keep private.

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:37.929
I just wanted to say thanks.

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:42.533
Good night.

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:50.807
Don't worry.
I'll get all the details for you later.
