WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:04.765
Let's see, what could this be?

00:04.808 --> 00:07.550
Oh, great. More junk.

00:07.594 --> 00:09.900
You can go right between
the old tin can

00:09.944 --> 00:12.642
and the thing that's either
a fish or a human foot.

00:12.686 --> 00:14.078
Actually, that one I keep.

00:14.122 --> 00:15.558
Yup! What the...?

00:15.602 --> 00:16.733
[grunts]

00:18.430 --> 00:20.694
Now what's all this?

00:20.737 --> 00:22.347
Some sort of...

00:22.391 --> 00:25.133
Some sort of junk!

00:25.176 --> 00:27.614
Congratulations,
little garbage collector.

00:27.657 --> 00:30.834
You found the treasure chest
containing two tickets

00:30.878 --> 00:32.836
to the hottest sold-out show:

00:32.880 --> 00:34.577
the Barnacle Banquet!

00:34.621 --> 00:37.711
Oh, my gosh. Ain't that
the showwith flying pirates,

00:37.754 --> 00:40.975
trained sharks,
and food so goodit'll give you scurvy?

00:41.018 --> 00:42.933
Why are y'all just giving away
tickets?

00:42.977 --> 00:44.781
My radio station is doing
everything in its power

00:44.805 --> 00:46.546
to stay relevant.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.897
Yeah, we keep losing listeners
to all those podcasts.

00:49.940 --> 00:52.160
Jason, shut your filthy mouth,
please.

00:52.203 --> 00:53.596
Anyways,
people have been looking

00:53.640 --> 00:55.816
for those tickets for months,

00:55.859 --> 00:57.992
but it looks like you just
found them by accident.

00:58.035 --> 01:00.603
Whoo-hoo! I knew hard work
never pays off.

01:00.647 --> 01:02.605
Oh, dang, I can't wait to tell
Tilly and Remy.

01:02.649 --> 01:04.607
Can I get a ride home?

01:04.651 --> 01:06.130
[Tilly & Remy]
What?

01:06.174 --> 01:08.437
Cricket, those tickets
are impossible to get.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.960
I can't believe you won them.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.788
I'm rich and I couldn't
even get them.

01:11.832 --> 01:13.311
That's not supposed
to be possible.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.878
Oh, this'll be amazing.

01:14.922 --> 01:16.663
I've always looked upto the show's hero,

01:16.706 --> 01:19.753
legendary swashbuckler
Mimi O'Malley.

01:19.796 --> 01:21.711
Hyah! Hyah!

01:21.755 --> 01:24.148
Pirates were my inspiration
to start fencing classes,

01:24.192 --> 01:26.760
so I'll be able to show off
the moves I've practiced.

01:26.803 --> 01:27.804
[grunts]

01:27.848 --> 01:29.240
Keep practicing.

01:29.284 --> 01:30.851
You've outdone yourself, buddy.

01:30.894 --> 01:32.722
This'll be a night
the three of us

01:32.766 --> 01:34.724
will never forget.

01:34.768 --> 01:36.639
Actually, I've only got
two tickets,

01:36.683 --> 01:38.946
so I can only take one of you.

01:38.989 --> 01:40.382
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:40.425 --> 01:42.471
Well, I guess you just
got to choose

01:42.514 --> 01:45.387
between the sister who moved
to Big City with you,

01:45.430 --> 01:47.650
who's cared for
and protected you all your life

01:47.694 --> 01:50.653
and will always be a
cornerstoneof your future,

01:50.697 --> 01:52.176
and, you know... Remy.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.570
Yeah! Your good,
good friend.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.876
Good points.

01:55.919 --> 01:57.486
On one hand, I have Remy.

01:57.529 --> 01:59.793
But on the other hand,
I have Tilly.

01:59.836 --> 02:01.708
Remy, you're a fiercely
loyal friend

02:01.751 --> 02:04.711
with the heart of a lion.

02:04.754 --> 02:07.583
And, Tilly, you always keep it
real, 100% of the time.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.106
- [clicks tongue]
- Oh, dang.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.693
You're both so great.
This is a dead heat.

02:10.717 --> 02:12.457
Give me a minute, y'all.

02:12.501 --> 02:14.808
Crickey's going to need some
thinky time.

02:14.851 --> 02:16.679
Oh, my gosh,
Cricket's gonna think.

02:16.723 --> 02:17.811
Thinky time.

02:17.854 --> 02:20.683
[straining]

02:20.727 --> 02:22.816
Ah! I can't choose.

02:22.859 --> 02:25.775
Very well, when fate hands me
an impossible choice,

02:25.819 --> 02:28.735
I must let fate itself
decide for me.

02:28.778 --> 02:31.868
Just like the founding fathers!

02:31.912 --> 02:33.261
Oof!

02:33.304 --> 02:34.828
This is hopeless.
I should just nap.

02:34.871 --> 02:36.699
[knock on door]

02:36.743 --> 02:38.440
Hey, little brother.

02:38.483 --> 02:40.834
I thought you might like a mug
of my famous hot cocoa

02:40.877 --> 02:42.705
while you're thinking
things over.

02:42.749 --> 02:44.228
Oh, wow, that's very nice
of you.

02:44.272 --> 02:46.666
- Marshmallows?
- Yes, please.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.145
[sighs]
Little baby pillows.

02:48.189 --> 02:49.886
- [knock on door]
- [Remy] Cricket?

02:49.930 --> 02:51.888
Just popping in to check on
where your head's at.

02:51.932 --> 02:54.674
Oh, I see you're here too,
Tilly.

02:54.717 --> 02:57.764
Yup. I made Cricket something
with sisterly love.

02:57.807 --> 03:01.724
So fun! By crazy coincidence,
I also got Cricket something.

03:01.768 --> 03:04.945
Vasquez, commence
Operation Flattery.

03:04.988 --> 03:06.511
[Bill]
Oh, hey, Vasquez. How's it--

03:06.555 --> 03:08.557
Oh, guess we can talk
another time.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.646
Cricket, this is for you.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.909
[gasps]
Look at this.

03:12.953 --> 03:15.869
It's so accurate.

03:15.912 --> 03:18.698
Oh, and you're giving me
Vasquez as well?

03:18.741 --> 03:20.743
Uh... mm-hm.

03:20.787 --> 03:22.702
[whispers]
Sorry.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.617
Very well, Master Cricket,
what is your first order?

03:25.661 --> 03:27.576
Hm. Vasquez, save my life.

03:27.619 --> 03:29.752
Is your life in danger, sir?

03:29.796 --> 03:31.319
It's about to be.

03:33.234 --> 03:34.801
- [grunts]
- Very good.

03:34.844 --> 03:36.716
But I'll get you soon,
you rascal.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.761
I look forward to the challenge.

03:38.805 --> 03:40.981
Uh, Cricket? Is there anything
else I can get you?

03:41.024 --> 03:42.591
Like my tea set,

03:42.634 --> 03:44.549
or maybe my prized
rock collection?

03:44.593 --> 03:46.073
Are you hungry?
I got us catering.

03:46.116 --> 03:48.684
And I can getwhatever else you need.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.120
Hm.

03:50.164 --> 03:51.992
Well, now that
I think about it...

03:52.035 --> 03:54.734
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.779
Not to pressure you, buddy,

03:56.823 --> 03:58.389
but have you decided
which one of us

03:58.433 --> 04:00.237
will get to go with you
to the Barnacle Banquet?

04:00.261 --> 04:02.959
We're getting a little tired
of waiting on you here.

04:03.003 --> 04:06.397
Uh, yeah, I'm still
mulling it over...

04:06.441 --> 04:07.747
[children laughing]

04:07.790 --> 04:09.749
Wow, that sounds so cool.

04:10.924 --> 04:14.579
Mm. Oh!

04:15.798 --> 04:17.278
[titters]

04:17.321 --> 04:19.671
I have made my decision.

04:19.715 --> 04:22.631
I have decided that
the ticket shall go to...

04:22.674 --> 04:23.850
neither of you.

04:23.893 --> 04:25.590
- [both] What?
- Well, there might be

04:25.634 --> 04:27.177
dozens of kids who want to go
to this show.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.831
Think of how unfair it'd be
not to consider

04:28.855 --> 04:30.987
all my close friends.

04:31.031 --> 04:33.424
Attention,
kids of the neighborhood!

04:33.468 --> 04:36.384
I have one extra ticket
to the Barnacle Banquet

04:36.427 --> 04:37.864
that will go to the kid

04:37.907 --> 04:40.562
who can make me the best offer.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.216
- What say you?
- [all gasp]

04:42.259 --> 04:44.609
[all chattering]

04:44.653 --> 04:47.090
Cricket,
are you sureyou're doing this to be fair?

04:47.134 --> 04:49.745
Yeah, because it seems like
you're milking this

04:49.789 --> 04:51.181
to get special treatment.

04:51.225 --> 04:55.098
Oh, please, come on.
You think I like this?

04:55.142 --> 04:57.884
Yes, brother.
Indeed I do.

04:57.927 --> 05:00.756
[Cricket] Next in line,
please step forward.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.062
Ah, young Benny.

05:02.105 --> 05:03.367
What have you brought today

05:03.411 --> 05:04.847
to bid for the honor
of my tickey?

05:04.891 --> 05:07.241
I brought my grandma's
prized jewelry.

05:07.284 --> 05:10.853
When she finds out I took it,
she's going to cry.

05:10.897 --> 05:12.855
But it's worth it.

05:12.899 --> 05:15.771
Fine. You may add it
to the family heirloom section.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.729
Next person step forward.
I'm rich.

05:17.773 --> 05:20.863
I would like to offer
youone week of free crime.

05:20.907 --> 05:23.518
That includes as
manymisdemeanors as you want,

05:23.561 --> 05:25.476
but only one felony, mister.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.522
Hm. This pleases me.

05:27.565 --> 05:29.045
You may add yourself
to the pile.

05:29.089 --> 05:30.481
Huzzah!

05:30.525 --> 05:32.701
Does anyone else
wish to make a bid?

05:33.963 --> 05:35.704
- [both] Hmph!
- Oh, hey, guys.

05:35.747 --> 05:37.575
Y'all stop by to
bring any more gifts, or...?

05:37.619 --> 05:39.490
Kids of the neighborhood,

05:39.534 --> 05:42.667
are you happy giving up
your favorite toys and treats

05:42.711 --> 05:44.495
with little hope of reward?

05:44.539 --> 05:47.063
Aren't you wondering when
Cricket will make his decision?

05:47.107 --> 05:48.891
[angry chatter]

05:48.935 --> 05:51.372
- Uh, friends...?
- You can take your
chances with Cricket,

05:51.415 --> 05:55.071
or you can go to the banquet
with us for free.

05:55.115 --> 05:57.769
- No gifts, no bribes, no catch.
- [all gasp]

05:57.813 --> 05:59.423
Wait, what? How?

05:59.467 --> 06:00.903
It wasn't easy.

06:00.947 --> 06:02.774
I had to donate an entire wing
to the theater

06:02.818 --> 06:05.038
by selling my father's
sports memorabilia.

06:05.081 --> 06:08.258
It was a rash decision,
and I will be grounded for it.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.607
He will.

06:09.651 --> 06:10.870
[excited chatter]

06:10.913 --> 06:12.697
He's a hero!

06:12.741 --> 06:14.047
So this is our offer.

06:14.090 --> 06:15.918
Take back your gift
from Cricket,

06:15.962 --> 06:18.442
and accept these tickets
for free.

06:18.486 --> 06:21.576
Or stay here and keep buttering
Cricket's biscuits

06:21.619 --> 06:23.839
till they're dried-upold apricots.

06:24.971 --> 06:27.147
Let's discuss...

06:27.190 --> 06:28.757
[all shouting]

06:28.800 --> 06:31.716
No! My throne of heavy-handed
symbolism!

06:31.760 --> 06:33.283
[coughs]

06:33.327 --> 06:35.329
- Hm?
- [excited chatter]

06:35.372 --> 06:37.089
I always wanted to see
the Barnacle Banquet.

06:37.113 --> 06:38.898
Fine, I don't need you.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.423
I've still got my looksand
the hottest tickets in town.

06:42.466 --> 06:45.556
I'll just have to find someone
who appreciates the value of...

06:45.600 --> 06:46.731
Hm?

06:46.775 --> 06:48.081
Perfect.

06:48.124 --> 06:49.386
Why, hello there, friend.

06:49.430 --> 06:51.040
Would you like
to accompany me on--?

06:51.084 --> 06:52.999
Ow!

06:53.042 --> 06:54.870
Why'd you hit me?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.263
Oh, sorry, I--

06:56.306 --> 06:59.005
You'd better be!
I was watching the birds!

06:59.048 --> 07:00.702
They help me relax!

07:00.745 --> 07:02.008
Oh, nice to meet you.

07:02.051 --> 07:03.748
I'm Cricket.
What's your name?

07:03.792 --> 07:05.925
- Gregly!
- Well, Greg, what if I--

07:05.968 --> 07:07.230
It's Gregly!

07:07.274 --> 07:08.971
Gregly. Right.

07:09.015 --> 07:11.669
Well, would you like to goto
the Barnacle Banquet with me?

07:11.713 --> 07:13.889
Ugh! I hate that kid stuff.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.456
What's in it for me?

07:15.499 --> 07:17.980
Uh, I've got some lint
and two marbles.

07:18.024 --> 07:19.764
Deal!

07:19.808 --> 07:24.160
And so, with this money
I stole from the poor,

07:24.204 --> 07:27.685
there is no one left on the
seasto challenge my rule.

07:27.729 --> 07:29.731
- [explosion]
- What's this?

07:29.774 --> 07:30.906
Ahoy, scallywags.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.081
[governor]
Mimi O'Malley?

07:32.125 --> 07:34.997
- Seize her!
- [exclaims]

07:35.041 --> 07:36.999
How are you still alive?

07:37.043 --> 07:38.653
Wrong question, governor.

07:38.696 --> 07:40.176
The question you shouldreally ask is,

07:40.220 --> 07:44.006
"Which do I value more,
my money or my life?"

07:44.050 --> 07:45.921
Oh! Sick.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.879
So this is how thingsused to be.

07:47.923 --> 07:48.924
[explosion]

07:48.968 --> 07:51.057
[all cheer]

07:51.100 --> 07:52.841
There! They did it again!

07:52.884 --> 07:54.297
They're all attacking her
one at a time.

07:54.321 --> 07:56.062
Why don't they attack her
as a group?

07:56.105 --> 07:58.325
This show is so unrealistic.

07:58.368 --> 08:00.718
Oh, well, this looks lovely.

08:00.762 --> 08:03.025
Just kidding! I hate it!
Send it back!

08:03.069 --> 08:05.897
And tell them to burn
that parrot to a crisp!

08:05.941 --> 08:07.769
Man, some people can be
so inconsiderate.

08:07.812 --> 08:09.075
Know what I'm saying, bro?

08:09.118 --> 08:11.120
Yep. I really do.

08:11.164 --> 08:13.035
- [all cheer]
- [explosions]

08:16.038 --> 08:17.909
[whimpers]

08:17.953 --> 08:19.346
And now, governor,

08:19.389 --> 08:21.565
I will take back
my gold and my ship,

08:21.609 --> 08:24.264
with the help of my two friends.

08:24.307 --> 08:27.745
[announcer]
Will the winner of the VIP
tickets please stand?

08:27.789 --> 08:29.051
Don't be shy.

08:29.095 --> 08:31.010
Mimi needs your help.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.143
Uh, it's us.
We're the VIPs.

08:34.187 --> 08:36.493
They want me to go up onstage?

08:36.537 --> 08:38.539
But I have diarrhea!

08:38.582 --> 08:39.888
Yup, I'm out.

08:39.931 --> 08:41.890
- [snaps fingers]
- Hey, Gordly, or whatever.

08:41.933 --> 08:43.718
You agreed to be-- Aah!

08:43.761 --> 08:45.161
Put me down.
There's been a mistake.

08:45.198 --> 08:46.895
- Huh?
- Welcome aboard.

08:46.938 --> 08:50.768
Could we get a big round
of applause for this buccaneer?

08:50.812 --> 08:51.900
[cheers and applause]

08:54.033 --> 08:55.730
This ain't right.

08:55.773 --> 08:57.210
I got to do something.

08:57.253 --> 08:58.776
[grunts]

08:58.820 --> 08:59.821
Kid, what are you doing?

08:59.864 --> 09:01.127
Come here.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.824
- Aah!
- Whoa!

09:02.867 --> 09:04.130
- Cricket?
- Hyah!

09:04.173 --> 09:05.870
- [screams]
- Whoa!

09:08.003 --> 09:10.745
Changing the script.
I love it.

09:10.788 --> 09:12.225
Look out, I'm coming in hot!

09:12.268 --> 09:13.661
- [both] Ah!
- [loud crash]

09:13.704 --> 09:15.097
[all scream]

09:18.144 --> 09:20.102
[all gasp]

09:20.146 --> 09:21.799
Cricket, what the heck?

09:21.843 --> 09:23.410
I was trying to get
you two onstage

09:23.453 --> 09:24.802
to make up for--

09:24.846 --> 09:26.195
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:26.239 --> 09:28.589
I made this whole thing
bad and weird.

09:28.632 --> 09:30.001
I don't know
what I should have done,

09:30.025 --> 09:32.114
but it was wrong to let
that power go to my head

09:32.158 --> 09:34.160
and take advantage of you two.

09:34.203 --> 09:37.772
Well, maybe it didn't help when
we made it into a competition.

09:37.815 --> 09:39.730
Yeah, we all messed this up,
huh?

09:39.774 --> 09:41.689
Mostly you messed this up.

09:41.732 --> 09:43.125
That's fair.

09:43.169 --> 09:46.911
Uh-oh, we're about
to be fish food!

09:46.955 --> 09:49.610
Aah! Oh, it's just a motor,
and the water's not that deep.

09:49.653 --> 09:50.959
Whoa.

09:51.002 --> 09:53.353
Blimey, that was some
high flying, kiddos.

09:53.396 --> 09:56.312
I can tell you three
are the best of friends.

09:56.356 --> 09:59.402
Inseparable. I bet you never
even have disagreements.

09:59.446 --> 10:02.884
But this script calls for only
two swashbuckling heroes,

10:02.927 --> 10:04.494
so who's it going to be?

10:04.538 --> 10:06.061
May I present your biggest fans,

10:06.105 --> 10:07.758
Sir Remy and Madam Tilly.

10:07.802 --> 10:09.673
[both gasp]

10:09.717 --> 10:13.503
And now, governor, I will take
back my ship and my gold

10:13.547 --> 10:15.592
with the help of my two friends.

10:15.636 --> 10:18.117
- En garde!
- [both] En garde!

10:18.160 --> 10:20.075
Hyah! Keep practicing.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.164
Um, I love your show.
You're my favorite character.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.080
And I even dyed my hair onceto
match the color of your ship.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.648
Yeah! Whoo!
Those are my friends!

10:27.691 --> 10:28.823
[explosion]
