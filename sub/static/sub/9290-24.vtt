00:12.200 --> 00:14.520
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.200
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle
turned up with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.720
I can call Foxton.
He can make this all disappear.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.640
All you have to do
is give me the okay.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.400
- David put you up to this, didn't he?
- Sherry, l...

00:30.240 --> 00:34.080
- The police think I killed Alan.
- Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.160
It's nobody's fault but your own.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.000
" Oh, my God! Sherry!"

00:42.080 --> 00:43.640
No!

00:46.120 --> 00:48.560
You committed treason.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.640
You facilitated the escape
of a man who was responsible...

00:51.720 --> 00:55.480
for the death of Ryan Chappelle
and almost a thousand civilians.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.480
With luck, the best
you can hope for is 20 years.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.880
Tell me how to find your couriers, or I am
gonna put your daughter in that building.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.760
You wouldn't dare.
She has nothing to do with this!

01:04.879 --> 01:07.320
- "Neither do the people in those body bags!"
- "Dad, stop them! No!"

01:07.440 --> 01:10.520
When your daughter's infected,
I'm gonna make you watch her die.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.360
- Dad, stop them!
- Stephen, you're out of time!

01:13.440 --> 01:16.760
Stop! Stop! I'll tell you!

01:16.920 --> 01:19.320
- Where's the 11 th vial?
- "Los Angeles."

01:19.440 --> 01:21.600
What's the target?

01:21.720 --> 01:25.760
His instructions were to select a public place
where maximum casualties would be inflicted.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.080
Target has stopped
moving. The target has stopped.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.800
Drop the bag! Get on the ground, now!
Don't move!

01:31.880 --> 01:33.880
- What's goin' on?
- Where is it?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.760
- "Where's what?"
- Where is it?

01:35.840 --> 01:38.000
- "Chase!"
- "What are you guys doin'?"

01:38.080 --> 01:40.080
- "What's goin'on?"
- Jack, I got a signal.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.520
Wh-What are you lookin'for?

01:43.600 --> 01:47.680
It's just a transmitter. He's put it
on an innocent. This man is not Rabens.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.520
Shut the station down now!

01:51.160 --> 01:54.800
The following takes place
between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.440
"This is Dessler."

01:59.520 --> 02:01.600
Michelle, it's Jack.
We just lost Rabens.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.480
He dumped the G.P.S. Beacon
onto an innocent.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.840
- He still has the virus?
- We have to assume so.
We're sweeping the station now.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.759
We've locked down
the entire building.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.640
We're gonna start moving passengers
through monitored checkpoints.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.280
How will you find Rabens?
We still don't have a sketch.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.960
We need Saunders to make an I.D. Move him
over from Holding to Chloe's station.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.120
We're setting up a live feed.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.800
Okay. We'll be ready on our end.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.840
Michelle, Gael Ortega's
wife, Theresa, is here.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.400
All right, Jesse.
Send her in.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.760
According to Chloe's statement...

02:37.880 --> 02:40.320
you were working in parallel
to bring down Saunders...

02:40.440 --> 02:42.880
even while you were
complying with his demands.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.760
Yeah. That's right. I, uh...

02:45.840 --> 02:48.960
I gave Chloe a recording of a conversation
between Saunders and myself...

02:49.080 --> 02:52.320
Chloe also said you intentionally
scrambled the voice...

02:52.440 --> 02:54.640
to slow down her progress.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.000
Tony, did you put
Michelle's life...

02:58.080 --> 03:01.440
ahead of public safety
or national security?

03:06.680 --> 03:08.480
Yes.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.800
I did.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.960
He said he was exposed
to a virus.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.360
Yeah, that's right.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.720
Did he suffer?

03:36.640 --> 03:40.280
No. No, he went quickly.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.800
Gael.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.440
He was a hero.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.040
He tried to stop the virus
from being released, and when it was...

03:56.120 --> 03:59.320
he just kept working...

04:01.640 --> 04:03.480
till the end.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.960
Thank you.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.000
Thank you.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.000
Can I pick up his things?

04:22.120 --> 04:23.920
Of course.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.240
- I'll go see what I can do.
- Okay.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.960
Wait here.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.840
- "Kim."
- Yes, Michelle.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.240
That's Mrs. Ortega,
Gael's wife.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.320
I need you to take her to his station
to pick up his personal belongings.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.240
- "Sure."
- "Thank you."

05:09.600 --> 05:11.400
Sit him down.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.160
Hello.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.040
Kim, I need you.
Saunders is here to I.D. Rabens.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.960
Well, I'm with Mrs. Ortega.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.600
Michelle said I could reassign anyone
I wanted to help me, and I want you.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.720
So please don't make me ask again.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.080
Um, fine. I'll get
Barry to watch her.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.400
- Barry.
- "Yeah."

05:44.080 --> 05:47.120
Please watch Mrs. Ortega
while she gathers Gael's things.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.360
- Sure.
- Take as much time as you need.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.800
Thanks.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.800
Excuse me, Barry.
Can I get a signature?

06:04.880 --> 06:06.960
Oh, sure.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.560
Thanks.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.800
- "Anything else for me?"
- "No, that's it."

06:12.880 --> 06:16.160
Sir, could you
step up to the line.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.320
Right here.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.320
Chin up, please, sir.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.600
Look at the camera.
Chin up.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.000
Move in closer on 2-A.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.920
Yeah, Jack. It's me.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.920
- " Any matches, Michelle?"
- "No. Nothing yet."

06:34.000 --> 06:37.320
- How far have you gotten?
- So far we've gone through
the first two sets of photos.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.480
Next group is uploading now.
Stand by.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.400
It's not him.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.040
- Is there anything on this page?
- Try 3-B, closer up.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.280
No. That's not him.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.600
No.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.600
Chin up, please.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.520
- No.
- " Do we have a match?"

06:58.640 --> 07:02.080
- That's a negative, Jack.
- I don't see him anywhere.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.240
- "Okay, next."
- Yeah.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.600
Turn to the front.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.600
Head up, sir.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.440
- Bring up 5-B.
- No.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.680
- Are you sure?
- He's not here.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.920
All right. Bring up the next page.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.080
What about this one? No?

07:26.160 --> 07:30.600
"Theresa, no!"

07:30.680 --> 07:32.920
He killed Gael!
Don't you understand?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.360
- I need medical!
- Michelle, what's going on over there?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.440
- Saunders has been shot.
- What are you talking about?

07:37.520 --> 07:40.640
- "Who shot him?"
- Gael's wife. Hold on, Jack.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.960
I need medical here now!

07:44.520 --> 07:46.880
- "Michelle, what is his condition?"
- Looks critical.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.880
You do everything you can
to keep him alive.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.800
He's our only
connection to Rabens.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.120
- Chase.
- "Yeah."

07:55.280 --> 07:57.800
He killed my husband!

07:57.880 --> 07:59.720
- Jack.
- Talk to me.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.840
- He didn't make it.
- Son of a bitch.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.840
We'll get back to you.
Saunders has just been shot.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.080
He's dead.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.200
Don't move, ma'am. Don't move!

08:09.320 --> 08:12.360
I didn't... He did kill...

08:12.440 --> 08:14.680
He killed...

08:14.760 --> 08:17.040
my husband.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.240
Red Line service
is experiencing significant delays at this time.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.840
Between the information we've gotten
from the captured couriers...

08:38.000 --> 08:40.720
and our own intelligence, we've
been able to confirm that Saunders...

08:40.880 --> 08:43.720
was the sole architect
of today's actions.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.240
If we catch this last man...

08:46.360 --> 08:50.320
Arthur Rabens, that'll be
the end of the threat.

08:50.400 --> 08:55.080
And if not, we're back to square one,
and the virus is back on the market.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.480
Find him.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.400
Hello, Wayne.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.680
Joseph, could you, uh,
give us a minute?

09:02.760 --> 09:05.680
- Thank you, Joseph.
- Mr. President.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.800
Well, did you get the prescription bottle
from Sherry's house?

09:15.640 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.920
Well, that's good.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.040
David.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.040
David, something horrible
happened, and I don't...

09:38.800 --> 09:40.600
Sherry's dead.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.280
What?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.600
How?

09:53.720 --> 09:57.920
Julia... She came in,
and she... she killed her.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.280
Then she turned
the gun on herself.

10:04.880 --> 10:09.400
- They're both dead?
- Yeah.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.840
Listen. I'm not gonna try to pretend
that we can just put this behind us...

10:30.920 --> 10:33.520
but the fact is...

10:35.200 --> 10:38.160
the fact is that politically
we're free of everything...

10:38.240 --> 10:42.120
free of Milliken's extortion, his death,
free of Sherry's involvement.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.200
You're thinking
of the politics of this?

10:49.240 --> 10:52.160
The mother of my children
has just been murdered.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.160
And the woman that I loved
just killed herself in front of me.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.360
I understand how you feel.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.680
There's a story here, David. There's
a story that can tie this all together.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.400
Alan Milliken was having
an affair with Sherry.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.960
Julia found out,
and then she killed them both.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.440
No. No. No.
I don't wanna hear it.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.640
- "Your emotions are clouding..."
- No!

11:28.200 --> 11:30.880
David, please just listen to me.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.840
Leave me alone.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.760
David, please.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.840
Jeannie?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.800
Yes, Mr. President?

12:05.920 --> 12:09.920
Would you get my son and my daughter
on a conference line.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.160
We're gonna separate the crowd
into units of 10.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.320
I want an officer
assigned to each unit.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.240
That officer's gonna be responsible
to make sure no one leaves that unit...

12:19.360 --> 12:21.520
- unless authorized by me or another C.T.U. Agent.
- I understand.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.880
Search every passenger...
every briefcase, purse, pocket...
then verify their identification.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.080
- We'll be here all day.
- Not if we find them.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.560
Yes, sir.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.880
I want you to initiate
another search of the station...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
including the tracks
a mile in each direction.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.920
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.240
Jack. We're locked down.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.440
We got two men at every exit.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.360
Good.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.240
Is there anything else
we can do right now?

12:46.360 --> 12:48.520
No. Not until we get
an I.D. on Rabens.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.120
Jack, listen.
About Mexico...

12:57.240 --> 13:01.480
I hope you know I understand
you were just doing your job.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.680
Look. It took me
a long time to understand...

13:05.800 --> 13:09.840
that if you want to do this job well,
you have to stay detached.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.760
If you can accept that,
you'll be fine.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.440
Yeah. Well,
I have accepted it.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.840
That's why I'm thinking
after today, I'm done.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.080
I don't want to be
detached, Jack.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.480
Not from Kim,
not from my daughter.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.600
I'm gonna request
a transfer to the floor.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.520
Are you sure about this?

13:40.160 --> 13:42.440
I'd still be serving my country.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.880
I can take care
of the people I care about.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.520
I owe them that, Jack.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.480
What'd Kim say?

13:51.560 --> 13:55.320
I think she's willing to give it a try
as long as I'm not in Field Ops.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.560
What do you think, Jack?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.920
I'm the last person
you should be asking.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.960
It's between you and Kim.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.280
Whatever you choose,
I would support.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.600
You're a good man, Chase.

14:23.080 --> 14:27.480
Let's go. Let's go. Move it in.
Form a line here, sir. Fast.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.960
We'll be checking your belongings
and your identification.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.840
Sir, please. At the end.
Thank you, sir.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.960
Take your glasses off.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.840
You only have nine people in your unit here.
Where is the man in the brown jacket?

15:28.960 --> 15:32.560
- I don't know.
- Chase, we have a passenger unaccounted for.

15:40.280 --> 15:44.400
This is Jack Bauer. We have two L.A.P.D.
Officers down at the northwest exit.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.280
I need transportation
to meet me on the corner.

15:51.040 --> 15:55.280
Help!
We need somebody over here now!

15:55.440 --> 15:57.840
I'm a federal agent. Did you see what happened?

15:57.960 --> 16:00.880
- A carjacking.
- Did you get a make on the car?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.800
- No.
- This is Jack Bauer.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.280
We've got a civilian casualty
on Hope and 7 th.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.240
Call 911!

16:08.400 --> 16:11.120
- Did you see which way the car went?
- He went straight down there.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.200
I need that transportation now!

16:27.560 --> 16:31.160
Michelle, this is Jack. Rabens is out
of the station. I repeat... Rabens is out.

16:31.280 --> 16:35.440
He was headed east on 5th Street less than
five minutes ago. I need to I.D. A stolen car.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.320
- I want you to give me a D.M.V. Readout on a...
- "Frank Cassar."

16:38.400 --> 16:41.520
Frank Cassar. Then I want you to set up
roadblocks in a five-mile radius...

16:41.600 --> 16:45.360
and coordinate sat surveillance,
traffic cameras, everything we've got.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.359
Yeah.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.920
Brad, it's me. I need to talk to you now.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.200
All right. I'll be right out.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.440
I need to step out.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.760
Brad, Rabens is gone.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.280
He got through the perimeter
at the M.T.A. station.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.520
- How the hell did that happen?
- "Doesn't matter how it happened."

17:36.600 --> 17:40.400
It happened. We identified the vehicle
he carjacked as a light blue Malibu.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.440
We set up a roadblock and uplinked
traffic cams and satellite sweeps...

17:43.520 --> 17:46.960
but I need Tony to coordinate
the data flow with Tactical.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.680
There's no downside here, Brad.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.960
You know he's not a flight risk, and
he'd be a major asset to the operation.

17:53.080 --> 17:56.440
- I could be brought up on charges if I let Tony out.
- We can't lose Rabens.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.880
So unless you want to take responsibility
and run Tactical yourself...

18:07.000 --> 18:10.280
you're wasting time, Brad.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.400
We need you on the floor.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.720
Come on, Chloe. Where's Rabens?

18:29.880 --> 18:33.720
Just a second, Jack.
I think I've got a match.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.240
A light green Malibu.
Intersection of 5th and Vanowen.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.160
Okay. We're only a few blocks away.
We're gonna head over there now.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.120
Adam, get me a closer
shot of that plate.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.080
Doing it now.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.960
I'm back in play, Jack.
Michelle got me up to speed.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.200
Tony, how long till the plate's I.D. 'd?

18:49.280 --> 18:52.920
- "Adam, do we have a match?"
- Yes, it's him. The plates match.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.040
- Jack, it's him.
- Which direction is he headed?

18:56.120 --> 18:57.880
- East on Del Mar, just past Franklin.
- That's the next block.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.880
Right there! Right there!

19:05.560 --> 19:08.680
Tony, we got him. He's headed south
on Manning towards the Chatham Center.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.160
- We're gonna need backup.
- Copy that.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.160
Tony, where's that backup
coming in from?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.880
From the east and south
on a reciprocal course.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.920
Okay. We just made a right.
We're headed west on De Soto.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.040
Move that thing out of here now!

20:05.600 --> 20:08.280
Tony, we've been cut off.
He's made a right onto Lawndale.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.200
He's headed north. We're
about three blocks behind him.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.040
We have three vehicles in the area ready
to cut him off. We're gonna corner him.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.520
Jack, we got him pinned
on Chamberlain, just north of Palm.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.440
Okay. Keep him there.
We're two blocks away.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.400
He's running into the middle school
on Chamberlain. Main entrance.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.320
Okay, Tony. We're coming up
on the middle school now.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.800
Tony, he's in the school.
I gotta get back to you.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.920
Tell the arriving teams
to secure the exits.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.960
We cannot evacuate this school.
We run the risk of losing him. Let's move.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.800
Haynes, cover the west exit.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.600
- You get anything?
- "Nothing."

21:29.720 --> 21:31.720
Cover your exit.
No one leaves this building.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.000
Chase, take your man.
Search the auditorium.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.800
All teachers and students are instructed...

21:57.920 --> 21:58.920
to remain in their classrooms
and lock their doors.

21:58.960 --> 21:59.960
To remain in their classrooms
and lock their doors.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.960
I repeat... Remain in the
classrooms and lock the doors.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.400
It's all right, children.
It's all right. It's all right.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.040
Let's all go
to the front of the class.

23:14.920 --> 23:18.360
Chase, this is Jack.
Second floor is clear. Do you copy?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.280
Chase?

24:10.800 --> 24:15.000
- Ah!
- No!

24:44.280 --> 24:48.360
No, Chase. Just lay still.
Everything's gonna be all right.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.440
It was the only thing I could do
to keep him from escaping with the virus.

24:57.440 --> 25:01.360
Don't waste your time. It's not coming off.

25:01.440 --> 25:04.440
- What are you talking about?
- Rabens didn't even try to remove it.

25:04.560 --> 25:08.120
If he could unlock it,
he would have.

25:08.240 --> 25:12.280
Tony, Rabens is dead.
The virus is in our possession.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.240
But the dispersal device
has been activated. I don't see a timer.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.880
- I've got no idea how long we've got.
- All right, Jack.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.080
- I need you to find a secure
container... anything ain't tight.
- I can't do that.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.480
- The device is attached to Chase's wrist.
- What?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.480
I need you to put me in touch
with one of the teams...

25:26.600 --> 25:28.760
that's been able to disarm
the device already.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.800
- All right. I'll get back to you.
- Hurry.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.960
Just support the device.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.120
Jack, I don't know how this
is all gonna turn out...

25:40.240 --> 25:42.480
but I want you to tell Kim
that I'm sorry...

25:42.600 --> 25:45.480
Whatever you gotta tell Kim, you tell her
yourself. We're gonna get through this.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.560
You just stay with me.
We're gonna get through this.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.800
Jack, I'm patching you through.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.280
Okay.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.200
Roger Sommers here.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.320
My partner had to fasten
the dispersal device to his wrist...

25:59.440 --> 26:01.640
to stop the courier
from escaping with it.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.800
I need to figure out how to disarm
the timer or remove the clamp.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.920
Forget about the clamp. It's titanium. It's
also wired into the tamper proof mechanism.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.400
Fine. Then let's disarm
the timer. What do I do?

26:10.520 --> 26:13.160
There's a plate at the opposite end
of the clamp. You need to open that up.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.840
Okay. I see it.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.880
Chase, stay with me.
Stay with me!

26:24.960 --> 26:28.200
Okay. I've got the timer. Three minutes,
51 seconds, counting down.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.960
You should see six wires to the left.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.200
Separate them from each other.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.160
- Okay. Done.
- Okay.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.560
The furthest to the left
should be red.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.200
Cut it without making
contact with the others.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.960
You ready?

27:07.480 --> 27:10.080
I cut the red wire, but
the timer's still counting down.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.880
That's okay. The timer
will stop at the next cut.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.200
Locate the green wire.
It's in the group to the right.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.600
Roger, I don't have a green wire.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.200
What color wires do you have?

27:30.280 --> 27:32.520
Orange, yellow, black and purple.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.080
They don't match.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.720
Jack, the devices don't match.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.320
Don't panic and don't cut any more wires
until we can figure this out on our end.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.640
Hurry. We're running out of time.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.200
Jack, you need to go.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.120
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.240
Do it.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.880
They're gonna call back.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.760
- You have to.
- They're gonna call back!

28:33.080 --> 28:34.960
It's okay.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.880
Ah!

29:50.800 --> 29:54.040
This is Jack Bauer. We have a man down
on the third floor science lab...

29:54.120 --> 29:56.520
northeast corner of the building,
requiring medical assistance.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.120
Emergency, now!

30:52.640 --> 30:54.720
Could you give us a minute, please?

30:54.800 --> 30:57.440
Yeah. Sure thing. Come on.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.960
What's going on?

31:05.040 --> 31:10.280
I'm back in custody. Hammond's
taking me down to Federal.

31:10.440 --> 31:15.800
No. No. They can't do this. Not after
everything you've accomplished today.

31:15.880 --> 31:21.320
Michelle, I put your well-being
above the country's.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.160
Nothing anybody can say
will ever change that fact.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.360
But they can't...
they can't put you in prison.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.920
Yes, they can.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.040
And they will for a long time.
Believe me.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.000
- Tony, don't talk like this.
- Michelle...

31:37.160 --> 31:39.040
- I can't...
- Michelle...

31:39.120 --> 31:41.960
- I won't give up on you. I can't.
- Michelle, don't do this.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.320
Baby, you're alive.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.040
And nobody else got hurt
because of what I did.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.640
And that's more than I hoped for.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.200
I can live with that.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.960
Even in prison.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.600
Tony, it's time.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.640
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

32:33.760 --> 32:37.600
Dr. Berman, radiology.
Dr. Berman, radiology.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.560
This is Bauer.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.400
Agent Bauer,
please hold for the president.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.360
- Jack?
- Mr. President.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.560
I wanted to thank you personally...

32:50.640 --> 32:53.680
not only for what you've done today,
but for everything.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.480
This country continues to owe you
a great debt of gratitude.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.000
Thank you, sir.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.960
I put you in an unimaginable
position earlier today...

33:04.080 --> 33:07.840
when I asked you to take the life
of one of your colleagues.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.520
Please forgive me for that.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.280
Mr. President,
there's nothing to forgive.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.160
It's what had to be done.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.120
It wasn't the only
sacrifice made today.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.040
I understand.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.880
- How is Agent Edmunds doing?
- He's in surgery now.

33:27.960 --> 33:31.520
It's going to be a few days before we know
whether or not he can use his hand.

33:33.880 --> 33:38.000
When he's strong enough to talk,
I'd like to thank him personally.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.800
He would appreciate that, sir.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.920
You know, Jack,
men and women like you...

33:44.000 --> 33:47.600
your courage and level
of commitment humbles me.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.520
Thank you, Mr. President.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.480
I'll let everyone know at C.T.U.
That you appreciated the job they did.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.920
Jack, there's one more thing.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.880
And please don't discuss this
with anyone until it becomes public...

34:00.000 --> 34:02.720
but I wanted you to hear it
from me personally.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.800
I've decided
not to seek reelection.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.480
This will be my only term.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.679
Mr. President, I hope you don't mind me saying
so, but I think you're making a mistake.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.520
Well, mistake or not,
it's what I've decided.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.760
When I'm a private citizen,
I hope we can become better friends.

34:21.840 --> 34:25.000
That would be an honor, sir.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.360
Thank you, Jack.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.480
Thank you, Mr. President.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.199
Come.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.719
Mr. President,
the motorcade's ready.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.679
Thank you, Aaron.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.560
Thank you, Wayne.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.080
Right in there.

35:34.240 --> 35:37.040
- Dad.
- Hey.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.040
Is Chase gonna be okay?

35:49.120 --> 35:51.480
The doctors are very optimistic.

35:51.600 --> 35:55.200
- They got him into surgery very quickly.
- Oh, thank God.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.120
Come here.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.240
I hear you and Chase
are gonna make some changes.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.320
I'm very happy for you.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.280
I thought you were
gonna be upset about it.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.240
I'm so proud of you.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.200
I'm sure whatever choices
you make will be the right ones.

36:23.320 --> 36:26.080
Thank you, Dad.
Thank you.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.000
You gonna be okay?

36:31.160 --> 36:34.680
Um, yeah.
I'm gonna be fine.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.680
There's some things
I have to deal with...

36:41.000 --> 36:43.040
but I'm gonna be fine.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.960
Are you gonna wait here
for Chase to get out of surgery?

36:47.080 --> 36:50.200
- Yeah.
- I've gotta leave for a little while.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.720
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.160
- I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.240
Okay.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.880
Dr. Wilson to nurses station.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.040
Jack, you there?

38:40.800 --> 38:42.640
Jack?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.480
This is Jack.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.960
I just got a call from District. They've
started interrogating Saunders's courier.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.920
We could use your help.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.520
Jack?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.440
Yeah.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.320
Jack, did you copy?

39:08.400 --> 39:10.240
I'm on my way.
