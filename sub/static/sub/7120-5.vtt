is going to totally cure you.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.357
Oh my gosh, what is it?

01:44.909 --> 01:48.476
First, the leaf fell off a tree.
Oh but, wait, wait, wait.

01:48.643 --> 01:49.437
Spell out!

01:49.854 --> 01:51.277

Oh no.

01:58.389 --> 02:00.785
Finn,

02:01.175 --> 02:02.357
Romance!

02:02.927 --> 02:04.602
Suspense!

02:05.419 --> 02:07.375
And it has to have a happy ending.

02:08.293 --> 02:10.597
But... I don't know
how to make that stuff happen.

02:11.253 --> 02:12.424
That's okay buddy.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.294
Just... dig me a hole then.

02:15.672 --> 02:16.826
Actually, two holes.

02:17.183 --> 02:19.510
One for my guts, one for my face.

02:19.635 --> 02:21.076
'Cause when I die,

02:21.201 --> 02:23.117
my guts are gonna blow outta my face.

02:23.755 --> 02:25.437
I am not gonna let that happen dude!

02:26.160 --> 02:28.738
Then go get me that story.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.397

02:31.787 --> 02:33.517

02:33.683 --> 02:35.750
I won't let your guts
blown out your face!

02:43.498 --> 02:44.437
"Romance".

02:44.603 --> 02:46.034
That should be easy.

02:51.108 --> 02:53.397
Hey, how about you two,
are y'all in love?

03:09.118 --> 03:10.462
Are y'all kissin in there?

03:14.857 --> 03:17.637
Maybe I should smoov out
my approach a bit.

03:18.090 --> 03:21.881
Normal guy, forest guy,
just like normal forest guy.

03:25.856 --> 03:26.857
So...

03:29.112 --> 03:30.683
So, yeah, can I...

03:32.824 --> 03:34.437
Can I watch you guys kissing?

03:35.129 --> 03:36.037
What?

03:36.586 --> 03:38.225
I just need to... for my friend.

03:38.350 --> 03:42.431
He's really sick and unless I tell him
about watching you guys kissing...

03:42.556 --> 03:45.989
What a weirdo!
You are one sick man, mister!

03:46.114 --> 03:48.237
Yeah, what this friend's name, huh?

03:48.866 --> 03:50.157
Jake! His name's Jake!

03:51.188 --> 03:52.987
Yeah, right. Sounds pretty fake.

03:53.112 --> 03:54.854
C'mon Boobafina,
let's get outta here.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.357
Wait! I'll do anything!

03:59.111 --> 04:01.605
- Would you eat dirt?
- I would for Jake!

04:07.267 --> 04:10.533
- Okay, now you guys kiss!
- Man, what a freak.

04:11.003 --> 04:13.716
- Let's go.
- What? No! Jake need this. Stop!

04:15.743 --> 04:17.755
Just c'mon.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.357
What? No!

04:19.971 --> 04:20.995
Gah! Wait!

04:26.663 --> 04:27.957
You see? No big deal.

04:31.144 --> 04:34.332
I can't believe you made me do that!

04:34.901 --> 04:37.557
I'm secretly in love with Mr. Goose.

04:38.031 --> 04:40.357
And now he'll never love me!

04:41.310 --> 04:44.357
Because now, I'm soiled.

04:48.551 --> 04:49.837
Oh no, oh no!

04:50.481 --> 04:54.465
I really did wanna kiss Boobafina.
I'm secretly in love with her.

04:54.590 --> 04:55.591
Okay, sweet.

04:55.925 --> 04:58.652
No, no. It had to happen naturally.

04:58.777 --> 05:00.277
Now, she'll never love me.

05:04.111 --> 05:05.429
That wasn't smoov.

05:05.929 --> 05:07.884
But it's all worth it to save Jake.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.611
Whatever it takes!

05:11.429 --> 05:12.597
A good fight.

05:16.923 --> 05:19.159
- You wanna fight me?
- Oh heck yeah!

05:19.284 --> 05:21.795
I've been waiting for this
my whole life!

05:22.448 --> 05:23.449
Yes.

05:24.607 --> 05:25.677
Oh no you don't!

05:27.301 --> 05:29.097
You never let me do anything!

05:33.208 --> 05:36.917
- You killed him!
- Mom! Quit touchin' me!

05:37.371 --> 05:39.357
You killed him and now he's dead!

05:39.811 --> 05:41.091
He's probably not dead.

05:41.411 --> 05:43.277
I'm sorry, though,
that you think he's dead!

05:45.163 --> 05:48.357
I don't wanna hurt aminals but...
But Jake!

05:52.606 --> 05:54.641
Okay, okay what's next?

06:06.187 --> 06:08.373
"Suspense".

06:19.511 --> 06:21.172
Hey you, guys.

06:21.653 --> 06:22.957
You wanna die?

06:28.953 --> 06:30.112
Boys!

06:30.898 --> 06:31.717
Boys!

06:32.210 --> 06:33.997
Have you seen my boys?

06:36.540 --> 06:37.541
No!

06:38.245 --> 06:39.600
I can't do it!

06:40.568 --> 06:42.077
I can't keep messing with folks.

06:44.783 --> 06:46.400
But Jake needs me.

06:46.525 --> 06:48.848
But I can't keep messing with folks.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.533
But Jake's really sick!
But I can't.

06:51.658 --> 06:53.720
But... But... But...

07:00.798 --> 07:02.117

07:06.237 --> 07:08.517
What's happening?
Are you guys gonna eat me?

07:08.683 --> 07:09.837
You'll see.

07:11.366 --> 07:12.277
Hey, wait!

07:12.950 --> 07:14.797
This is really suspenseful!

07:22.083 --> 07:23.277
What is this?

07:23.749 --> 07:28.282
- This is the rite of forest justice!
- Huzzah!

07:28.407 --> 07:30.077
Finn, the human boy,

07:30.244 --> 07:33.031
For your crimes
against the inhabitants of the forest,

07:33.156 --> 07:36.517
you must enter the earth,
and become one with the soil.

07:38.923 --> 07:40.517
Don't I get a trial or something?

07:41.005 --> 07:44.037
- No! Lower the cage!
- Huzzah!

07:46.673 --> 07:48.288
I'm totes gonna die!

07:48.756 --> 07:51.637
And now Jake won't get his story.
And he'll die too!

07:52.175 --> 07:54.835
'Cause I still haven't
a happy ending!

08:02.159 --> 08:03.331
Wait a minute!

08:03.456 --> 08:06.557
I may be busy dying
but y'all need to get busy living!

08:08.618 --> 08:11.237
Y'all are living some unhappy lives!
You, Boobafina.

08:12.123 --> 08:14.877
You love Mr. Goose!
You just need to tell him.

08:15.043 --> 08:17.030
- What?
- She loves you.

08:17.155 --> 08:19.230
Y'all just need to hook it up!

08:19.355 --> 08:21.699
I've been wanting to date you
for years.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.102
- You really love me?
- I do.

08:26.883 --> 08:28.117
And you, Mr. Fox.

08:28.283 --> 08:31.797
You need to face facts, man.
Boobafina's not interested.

08:31.964 --> 08:33.197
It's time to move on.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.716
It's true... it's for the best.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.157
- And hey! Jerky teenage bear.
- What?

08:38.658 --> 08:39.738
Your mom is right!

08:39.863 --> 08:42.277
You shouldn't go around
fighting strangers in the forest.

08:43.923 --> 08:44.917
Mama bear!

08:45.084 --> 08:46.664
Your son's not a baby anymore!

08:46.789 --> 08:48.957
You should stop spanking him
in the face.

08:49.377 --> 08:52.677
He's right.
It's time to let you grow up.

08:52.844 --> 08:53.957
That's the stuff.

08:54.429 --> 08:56.317
- Huzzah!
- And Mrs. Cow.

08:57.068 --> 08:58.775
Take that bag off your udder.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.299
You're a beautiful girl!
You live in the forest.

09:01.424 --> 09:03.180
So why don't you let it hang out?

09:07.083 --> 09:08.517
Yo! Put that bag back on!

09:10.448 --> 09:12.197
- Huzzah!
- Silence!

09:12.695 --> 09:13.734
Finn the human,

09:13.859 --> 09:16.797
for meddling in our lives
and disturbing the order of the forest.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.077
- We thank you.
- What!

09:20.547 --> 09:22.837
Our lives have improved
since you came here.

09:23.003 --> 09:25.119
Does that mean
you're gonna released me?

09:25.244 --> 09:27.557
Your cage is made of sticks, brother.
Just kick it apart.

09:27.964 --> 09:28.965
Cool!

09:31.070 --> 09:32.837
I'm comin' for ya, Jake!

09:33.347 --> 09:35.103
With a story!

09:36.786 --> 09:38.394
And then, what's happened?

09:39.384 --> 09:41.697
And then,
everyone in the forest was happy.

09:41.822 --> 09:42.797
The end.

09:44.403 --> 09:47.807
- What? What's wrong?
- That's was perfect!

09:47.932 --> 09:50.357
- I feel a million times better.
- Really?

09:50.789 --> 09:52.187
Yeah, yeah.

09:52.312 --> 09:55.502
The romance stopped my fever,
the suspense cured my headache,

09:55.627 --> 09:57.878
and everything else
cured everything else!

09:58.003 --> 10:00.277
I'm not sick! I'm not sick!

10:01.478 --> 10:02.479
Neat.

10:05.774 --> 10:08.237
Finn, come on!
Dance the health dance with me!

10:08.403 --> 10:10.079
No, I'm good.

10:12.603 --> 10:14.317
You allergic to my health dance?

10:17.007 --> 10:19.637
No, I just feel bad.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.517
Finn, did you catch my sick?

10:22.998 --> 10:25.349
Yeah, I think so.

10:25.474 --> 10:27.699
Well, I know just
how to make you feel better.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.957
Blankie, rubby, and best of all,
