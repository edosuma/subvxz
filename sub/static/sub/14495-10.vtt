She changed into this.

00:17.657 --> 00:20.857
The Skrull had her appearence, her voice.

00:20.858 --> 00:23.058
Yes, but it also had her memories.

Little green man,

04:55.617 --> 04:58.917
you speak English pretty well,
for a Martian.

04:58.918 --> 05:00.618
So what do you want?

05:00.669 --> 05:04.369
We already have everything
we want from you.

05:04.451 --> 05:07.951
But perhaps there is something
you'd like to tell us.

05:10.121 --> 05:11.821
There is...

05:11.822 --> 05:15.822
Name: Steven Rogers.

05:32.418 --> 05:35.418
Sir, I do not understand...

05:35.444 --> 05:37.444
what is it we want from this animal?

05:37.493 --> 05:39.527
We have all the knowledge he possesses.

05:39.528 --> 05:43.128
The Queen wants to learn
how to make these humans submit.

05:43.429 --> 05:45.129
So break him!

05:49.530 --> 05:52.230
<i>It's been two of their Earth months,</i>

05:52.618 --> 05:54.789
<i>he still hasn't broken.</i>

05:54.919 --> 05:57.651
<i>He hasn't given us anything.</i>

05:59.364 --> 06:03.364
<i>He's taken punishment that no human

06:07.165 --> 06:10.995
They have no idea
what's keeping him going.

06:11.342 --> 06:14.342
The Queen has ordered a new tactic.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.236
No!

06:36.387 --> 06:39.487
You are a very difficult man to find, Captain.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.738
How stupid do you think I am?

06:53.551 --> 06:56.352
Enough of this.
Secure the prisoner!

07:23.841 --> 07:26.860
We need reinforcement
in the prison block, now!

07:26.898 --> 07:31.299
Calm yourself, Kl'rt.
This human is no threat.

07:31.412 --> 07:34.412
There's nothing special
about Captain America.

07:34.507 --> 07:38.207
And besides...
where is he going to go?

07:39.208 --> 07:42.208
Commander,
there is no sign of the human,

07:43.034 --> 07:46.842
And the interrogator...
He is missing.

07:54.848 --> 07:58.848
No. Stay away...
stay away from me!

07:58.849 --> 08:00.849
I've got some questions for you now.

08:00.850 --> 08:03.550
Where are we?
What is this place?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.851
Please. Don't hurt me.

08:07.852 --> 08:09.452
How do I get out?

08:10.778 --> 08:14.647
Out?
There is no way out.

08:52.754 --> 08:54.054
Stay back!

08:54.930 --> 08:57.336
I don't know what kind
of trick this is, Skrull.

08:57.393 --> 09:00.593
But if you value this one's life,
you'll do exactly as I say.

09:00.857 --> 09:04.658
Ma'am, I'm a prisoner
here just like...

09:04.928 --> 09:07.928
Viper, you're
Madam Viper, right?

09:08.453 --> 09:10.953
One of Baron Strucker's lieutenants.

09:11.030 --> 09:12.709
You work for HYDRA.

09:12.736 --> 09:15.736
Do you really expect me to believe
you're Captain America?

09:15.808 --> 09:18.684
I've seen lizard steel faces...

09:18.834 --> 09:22.052
We fought once...
on HYDRA island.

09:22.140 --> 09:26.260
If I'd fought Captain America
then Captain America would be dead.

09:26.354 --> 09:28.328
They replaced you.

09:28.593 --> 09:32.293
The Viper I met,
must have been one of them.

09:35.869 --> 09:37.169
What are you doing?

09:37.170 --> 09:38.970
I am Captain America, Miss.

09:39.283 --> 09:42.783
I'm a human
and I'm guessing you are too.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.646
I believe this is yours.

10:03.373 --> 10:04.873
I'm not a Skrull.

10:05.092 --> 10:06.892
We may be enemies back on Earth...

10:06.968 --> 10:10.082
but right now
we have to work together.

10:10.144 --> 10:12.244
I don't like it any better than you...

10:12.477 --> 10:14.777
But we have to trust each other.

10:14.778 --> 10:17.478
It's the only chance
either of us have of getting home.

10:20.479 --> 10:24.179
- Where are we?
- Some kind of flying saucer.

10:24.442 --> 10:26.842
I think I saw Saturn out the window.

10:27.149 --> 10:28.449
Saturn?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.782
We need answers,
so start talking.

10:35.783 --> 10:38.283
Why are you Skrulls
replacing people on Earth?

10:38.284 --> 10:39.884
What do you want?

10:41.959 --> 10:45.659
You will not hurt me.
We know you.

10:47.986 --> 10:50.286
Maybe I won't.

10:50.287 --> 10:53.587
But I can't be responsible
for what she may do.

10:58.588 --> 11:02.588
There is a prophecy
among the Skrull people.

11:03.451 --> 11:06.851
<i>One that foretold
the end of our world.</i>

11:06.964 --> 11:12.565
<i>And it came to pass
for Galactus came to Skrullus.</i>

11:14.192 --> 11:18.893
<i>The end had come,
for Galactus is a force of nature.</i>

11:19.094 --> 11:22.294
<i>He can't be reasonned with
or bargained with,</i>

11:22.295 --> 11:24.895
<i>he has no conscience or mercy.</i>

11:25.133 --> 11:27.633
<i>He only consumes.</i>

11:43.297 --> 11:46.797
<i>The Skrull people were
scattered across the galaxy.</i>

11:46.798 --> 11:51.399
<i>There were rumors however,
a belief.</i>

11:51.400 --> 11:55.400
<i>That the same prophecy that
foretold the end of Skrullus,</i>

11:55.401 --> 11:59.001
<i>told of a new Skrull homeworld.</i>

11:59.602 --> 12:01.603
You're invading Earth!

12:01.758 --> 12:05.558
Our agents have been on you world
for over a year now.

12:05.785 --> 12:08.553
Learning, infiltrating.

12:08.690 --> 12:12.682
We have replaced humans
in key strategic locations.

12:12.806 --> 12:15.806
All to facilitate the transition.

12:15.807 --> 12:18.807
Transition?
You've come to wipe us all out!

12:18.951 --> 12:21.251
No.
Not all of you.

12:21.409 --> 12:26.710
Those who submit will be
spared, and kept as slaves.

12:26.711 --> 12:30.899
Even if the two of you were to
get off this ship, it's too late.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.967
We have Skrulls
in every organization on Earth.

12:35.744 --> 12:39.144
I only tell you this
because the invasion you spoke of...

12:39.870 --> 12:43.771
It is already over.
You lost.

12:43.947 --> 12:46.901
I want to know
what color its blood is.

12:46.992 --> 12:48.792
Step aside, Avenger!

12:49.137 --> 12:52.996
You have other prisoners.
Where?

13:31.719 --> 13:33.019
Everybody freeze!

13:33.020 --> 13:36.020
What is this?
Some kind of trick?

13:36.321 --> 13:39.520
They can take our appearences,
they are shapeshifters.

13:39.578 --> 13:41.378
Any of you can be one of them.

13:48.091 --> 13:50.091
Don't do it, drone.

13:51.473 --> 13:53.873
Will someone tell me
what is going on here?

13:56.225 --> 13:58.225
Everybody, stand down!

13:58.602 --> 14:02.344
My name is Steve Rogers.
I'm Captain America.

14:02.451 --> 14:04.451
And I'm a prisoner here just like you.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.733
Some of you I know,
some of you I don't.

14:07.060 --> 14:10.961
But we've all got one thing
in common, we're human.

14:11.531 --> 14:13.831
And right now
our home is in trouble.

14:13.832 --> 14:16.232
So whatever problems
we've got with each other,

14:16.233 --> 14:18.233
we have to put all that aside.

14:18.234 --> 14:21.087
We have to work together
to escape this place...

14:21.147 --> 14:22.447
and get back to Earth.

14:25.229 --> 14:27.229
You think I'm going to listen to you?

14:27.437 --> 14:30.137
You will, Cobra.
We can destroy them all later.

14:30.238 --> 14:33.238
But for now,
you'll do as Captain America says.

14:34.739 --> 14:36.839
Do we have some kind of plan here?

14:36.840 --> 14:39.040
We were brought to the ship in shuttles.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.796
I regained consciousness aboard one.

14:40.842 --> 14:43.342
If they can get us to here,
they can get us to Earth.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.268
Where are you going?

14:47.844 --> 14:49.144
We have to keep moving.

14:49.145 --> 14:50.445
Captain!

14:51.533 --> 14:52.833
Is that...

14:53.547 --> 14:56.647
- The Invisible Woman.
- What are they doing to her?

14:56.648 --> 14:59.348
They've got her sedated.
Smart.

14:59.349 --> 15:01.349
She's more powerful
than all of us put together.

15:01.912 --> 15:04.614
The Skrulls know where we are
by now, they'll be coming for us.

15:04.688 --> 15:07.688
She's dead weight,
she will only slow us down.

15:07.739 --> 15:09.039
Captain?!

15:17.253 --> 15:20.754
We are getting out of here.
All of us.

15:22.085 --> 15:25.085
Security is down
in the Beta prison cell block.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.125
Enough of this, Kl'rt...

15:27.201 --> 15:29.801
No matter what happens,
they cannot leave this ship!

15:34.958 --> 15:37.158
<i>Captain, if we need
to sacrifice the others...</i>

15:37.159 --> 15:40.272
to get me on that shuttle
I give you full authorization to do so.

15:40.384 --> 15:42.184
Who are you?

15:42.236 --> 15:44.536
Henry Gyrich, director of S.W.O.R.D.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.662
What's S.W.O.R.D.?

15:47.663 --> 15:50.763
We're the agency responsible
for dealing with alien threats.

15:50.764 --> 15:53.664
Well, I hope they'll fire you.

15:57.927 --> 15:59.227
No guards...

16:00.591 --> 16:02.791
- It's a trap.
- Agreed.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.879
We've got no choice though.

16:08.468 --> 16:12.569
- What happened to you?
- What happened...

16:12.570 --> 16:15.870
Is that I was given a reason
to hate people like you.

16:17.971 --> 16:19.271
Let's move out!

16:55.272 --> 16:56.572
Take her!

16:56.573 --> 16:58.073
Quatermain,
get them to the ship!

16:58.074 --> 17:00.574
If you AIM scientists
are as smart as you say...

17:00.575 --> 17:02.375
figure out how to fly that thing.

17:03.263 --> 17:05.963
It's an alien spacecraft,
I'll need time.

17:06.077 --> 17:07.977
Then we'll give it to you.

17:35.878 --> 17:38.779
We cannot beat this thing!
We have to run!

17:42.998 --> 17:44.998
Destroy them all!

17:46.281 --> 17:47.581
You know what, snake skin?

17:47.582 --> 17:49.882
I think running might be a good plan.

18:06.383 --> 18:08.883
Humans,
you think you are special.

18:09.084 --> 18:12.684
Even your powers,
we can make more powerful.

18:15.484 --> 18:17.984
Get away from her,
you filthy Skrull.

18:19.786 --> 18:22.048
- You figured this out?
- Please...

18:22.073 --> 18:23.454
I once designed a weapon...

18:23.479 --> 18:26.188
that can wipe out any human life
on Earth simultaneously.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.889
There no science I can't master.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.090
See if you can access the weapons.

18:35.091 --> 18:37.091
Way ahead of you, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.619
What are you doing?
You're firing on our people!

18:51.717 --> 18:56.418
If Captain America and Viper have to be
sacrificed for us to live, so be it...

19:04.982 --> 19:06.582
Go!
Get to the ship!

19:07.283 --> 19:10.084
Come on, let's... go.

19:10.098 --> 19:11.998
Super villains...

19:14.273 --> 19:17.902
Hang on tight, Mr Gyrich.
Things are gonna get bumpy.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.457
Go!
What are you waiting for?

19:21.002 --> 19:23.602
We're waiting for Cap and Viper, jerk.

19:27.603 --> 19:29.203
Take my hand!

19:32.804 --> 19:34.104
No!

19:37.805 --> 19:40.305
Is he insane?!
What is he doing?!

19:40.306 --> 19:41.906
He's being Captain America.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.801
Get to the ship
and tell them to launch.

19:47.951 --> 19:49.951
I'll hold them as long as I can.

19:51.296 --> 19:52.596
Go!

20:05.210 --> 20:08.414
The Commander was wrong,
you are dangerous.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.473
Too dangerous to leave alive.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.612
Go!

20:29.613 --> 20:32.013
Do it!
Hit the thrusters or something!

20:43.376 --> 20:44.676
OK, then...

20:46.558 --> 20:49.459
Hi, Cap.
I'm gonna sleep now...

20:53.017 --> 20:54.802
You saved my life.

20:54.858 --> 20:57.618
I do not like being in my enemies debt.

20:57.619 --> 20:59.119
Understand this...

20:59.120 --> 21:03.121
once the Skrull threat is over,
we will be enemies again.

21:04.122 --> 21:07.723
Understood.
Think you can get us home?

21:09.734 --> 21:13.273
<i>The humans,
they have escaped, my Queen.</i>

21:13.405 --> 21:17.128
<i>They are heading for Earth now,
but we aren't able to pursue.</i>

21:17.197 --> 21:20.253
The damage to our ship
is too extensive.

21:20.289 --> 21:23.755
I have failed you, My Queen.

21:23.828 --> 21:27.455
<i>No. You may not've learned
how to break the humans.</i>

21:27.510 --> 21:29.710
<i>But what Captain America did there,</i>

21:30.030 --> 21:34.331
<i>he took mortal enemies and led them,
he inspired them.</i>

21:34.332 --> 21:36.832
<i>They listened to him,
they believed in him.</i>

21:37.650 --> 21:40.833
<i>This is the key to subdicating
the humans.</i>

21:41.214 --> 21:43.814
<i>Captain America will
convince them to embrace us,</i>

21:44.035 --> 21:47.685
<i>to embrace change.
And they will listen...</i>

21:48.096 --> 21:49.677
<i>they will believe...</i>

21:49.887 --> 21:53.387
<i>After all,
he is Captain America.</i>

21:53.739 --> 21:56.039
<i>Contact the fleet, Commander.</i>

21:56.115 --> 21:58.515
<i>Begin the Wakanda infiltration.</i>

21:58.709 --> 22:03.209
<i>And send the rest of the forces
to New York and Washington DC.</i>
