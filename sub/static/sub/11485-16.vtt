00:01.317 --> 00:03.285
<i>Previously on Two and a Half Men.</i>

00:04.521 --> 00:06.182
That is a very sexy woman.

00:07.557 --> 00:10.117
- So whose car is it?
- Psychiatrist.

00:11.661 --> 00:13.094
Let's get out of here, Charlie.

00:13.163 --> 00:15.028
You are not just going
to leave me here, are you?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.032
Here we are. Chez Charlie.

00:18.902 --> 00:22.133
- She's taking her clothes off.
- Is this a great country or what?

00:22.205 --> 00:23.695
You guys are so cute.

00:23.807 --> 00:24.831
Right back at you.

00:24.908 --> 00:27.206
Good, Charlie.
Keep hitting on the deranged woman.

00:27.310 --> 00:30.177
Hey, Charlie, you're a really cool guy.

00:30.246 --> 00:32.406
But I'm not going to have sex with you.

00:32.515 --> 00:33.539
Ever?

00:35.719 --> 00:37.914
Deep tissue massage, pancakes.

00:38.021 --> 00:42.219
If you had a TV on your forehead and could
breathe through the ears you'd be perfect.

00:43.193 --> 00:46.356
You just assume that if we are both
interested in the same woman

00:46.429 --> 00:48.795
- you would come out on top?
- Of course I would.

00:48.865 --> 00:50.162
What are you afraid of?

00:50.233 --> 00:52.895
I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard
I'll be an only child.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.437
- Are you sure?
- It's settled. You are staying with us.

00:55.538 --> 00:57.802
Of course, we still don't know
a damn thing about her.

00:57.874 --> 00:59.273
I'm Joanie.

00:59.776 --> 01:00.970
Hi.

01:01.077 --> 01:03.602
We are going to go
to Charlie and Alan's house, hon.

01:03.713 --> 01:07.046
It's a wonderful place where
those awful people will never find us.

01:09.919 --> 01:11.716
So, Frankie,

01:12.489 --> 01:14.650
why didn't you tell us you had a daughter?

01:15.458 --> 01:17.722
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.295
I didn't want you to know.

01:22.232 --> 01:24.257
Okay. I feel better.

01:24.768 --> 01:26.793
I'm sorry, it's a long story.

01:26.903 --> 01:29.804
We got time. I'm not doing anything.
Alan, you doing anything?

01:29.906 --> 01:30.998
No, I'm free.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.470
I was staying with my grandma
and grandpa, who are really rich,

01:35.578 --> 01:38.672
and they don't want my mom to have me,
so they said she's crazy.

01:40.283 --> 01:41.614
That wasn't so long.

01:42.519 --> 01:47.582
- Can we please talk about this later?
- Okay. What shall we talk about?

01:48.591 --> 01:49.785
Are you guys gay?

01:53.463 --> 01:55.522
Isn't she something?

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

02:04.908 --> 02:07.035
Okay, here we are.

02:08.144 --> 02:10.407
This is it, right? One kid, no pets?

02:12.081 --> 02:13.173
As far as I know.

02:14.150 --> 02:17.347
- Can I go look at the ocean?
- Sure, just stay on the deck.

02:22.325 --> 02:24.156
Okay, who has the first question?

02:27.263 --> 02:29.094
- Alan.
- Thank you.

02:31.601 --> 02:34.331
- What the hell is going on?
- Good one.

02:35.405 --> 02:39.034
Here it is. I married a really rich guy,
and his parents always hated me.

02:39.108 --> 02:41.235
I don't know.
Maybe it was because when we met,

02:41.344 --> 02:43.608
he was on the road
to becoming a U.S. Congressman

02:43.713 --> 02:46.546
and I was just, you know, on the road.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.881
Joanie, get off the railing.

02:50.119 --> 02:52.781
Anyway, they were not happy
when we got married,

02:52.889 --> 02:56.222
and they were even less happy
when we used part of his trust fund

02:56.292 --> 02:57.691
to finance my recording career.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.752
- You're a singer?
- Well, as it turns out, no. But...

03:03.299 --> 03:04.857
Then two years ago, Brad died.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.233
And ever since, his parents have been
trying to take Joanie away from me.

03:08.304 --> 03:10.465
- So, the psychiatrist...
- Court ordered.

03:10.573 --> 03:13.406
They're suing me for custody,
saying I'm an unfit parent.

03:13.543 --> 03:15.101
- Unfit, how?
- You know...

03:18.381 --> 03:19.541
I'm not a lawyer,

03:19.616 --> 03:22.141
but taking a baseball bat
to the shrink's Beamer

03:22.252 --> 03:23.981
might not have helped your case.

03:24.721 --> 03:27.246
Yeah, they'll probably spin that one
in their favor.

03:27.323 --> 03:28.517
But I was screwed anyway

03:28.591 --> 03:30.991
because they were paying him
to make me look bad.

03:31.094 --> 03:33.426
- That's horrible.
- So what are your plans now?

03:33.496 --> 03:36.624
I don't know. I didn't think past
just getting her out of there.

03:36.733 --> 03:37.757
You don't have to know.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.098
You can stay here for a while
and figure it out. Right?

03:40.169 --> 03:42.729
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.672
That'd be great. I'll go tell Joanie.

03:46.442 --> 03:49.639
Terrific. We're happy to have you.

03:51.581 --> 03:53.481
Okay, we've got to get her out of here.

03:55.451 --> 03:57.578
- Charlie, she needs us.
- She doesn't need us.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.316
She needs a lawyer
and probably a new shrink.

04:01.124 --> 04:02.989
Well, then we'll get her those.

04:03.092 --> 04:05.856
At this point, I think I'd like
to stop using the word "we. "

04:05.962 --> 04:07.293
You're going to bail on her?

04:07.363 --> 04:09.695
Two days ago,
you couldn't wait to get her in bed.

04:09.799 --> 04:12.700
That's because two days ago,
she was just a crazy stranger.

04:12.802 --> 04:15.430
If I remember correctly,
you couldn't wait to get rid of her.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.302
Yes, because she was a crazy stranger.

04:17.373 --> 04:20.035
Now I've gotten to know her
and I want her to stay.

04:20.142 --> 04:23.874
All right, Alan, but I'm warning you.
This girl's got a lot of baggage.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.108
I don't know if you have enough
sky cabs to get her to the curb.

04:29.819 --> 04:30.843
What?

04:33.890 --> 04:36.950
So, Joanie, what grade are you in?

04:37.026 --> 04:38.493
- Second.
- Really?

04:38.561 --> 04:40.791
- I have a little boy who's in fourth.
- So?

04:43.466 --> 04:47.129
I don't know. I thought it'd be germane
to the conversation.

04:49.005 --> 04:52.907
Wow. Doesn't matter how old they are,
you still strike out.

04:56.145 --> 04:59.342
You know, Joanie,
you are just as pretty as your mom.

04:59.515 --> 05:00.641
So?

05:02.051 --> 05:03.484
I bow to the master.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.045
Hold on, let me finish.

05:08.091 --> 05:10.457
All right,
I'm going to say this one more time

05:10.560 --> 05:12.755
real slow so there's no confusion.

05:12.862 --> 05:14.386
You can take your damn money

05:14.464 --> 05:17.024
and stick it up
your "white bread, country club,

05:17.100 --> 05:19.466
"Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass.

05:21.537 --> 05:23.869
Hi.

05:25.441 --> 05:29.434
- Really? I'm garbage.
- Is Alan here?

05:30.279 --> 05:32.110
Really? Is that right?

05:32.215 --> 05:35.742
Well, I got news for you, lady.
The term is white trash.

05:37.153 --> 05:40.145
- Do you know her?
- Nope, that's a new one.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.090
- Hi, Dad.
- Jake, Judith. What are you doing here?

05:44.160 --> 05:47.095
Alan, I told you yesterday
I was going to visit my parents.

05:47.163 --> 05:48.892
Dad's having another colonoscopy.

05:48.965 --> 05:51.092
If I'm not there,
I'll have to watch the video.

05:51.167 --> 05:54.432
Yeah, right. I'm sorry.
There's just been a lot of stuff going on.

05:54.504 --> 05:56.904
Yeah. I just met your brother's latest stuff.

05:57.507 --> 06:00.237
- Why do you assume it's his stuff?
- What? Is it yours?

06:00.309 --> 06:01.936
No, but it's not his, either.

06:02.011 --> 06:04.605
- But it could be.
- Says who?

06:04.680 --> 06:05.908
Says your ex-wife.

06:05.982 --> 06:09.975
Okay, I really don't need to hear this.
Jake, honey, have a good time.

06:10.086 --> 06:11.951
Charlie, behave yourself.

06:12.855 --> 06:14.152
What about me?

06:14.257 --> 06:16.657
I am completely capable
of having my own stuff.

06:18.094 --> 06:22.463
- Hi, I'm Joanie.
- Hey. I'm going to go play in my room.

06:22.532 --> 06:24.432
- Can I come with you?
- Whatever.

06:26.035 --> 06:29.869
If he can just keep that attitude
for another 30 years, he's gold.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.134
I'm not afraid of your lawyers
or your shrinks.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.968
Fine, bring them on,
because you know what?

06:37.046 --> 06:39.173
We're going to run away and hide.

06:40.616 --> 06:42.641
Now they're really unhappy with me.

06:42.718 --> 06:46.848
- Is there anything we can do?
- Thanks, you've already done so much.

06:46.956 --> 06:49.891
- I just hate to put you out like this.
- It is not a problem.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.018
We have plenty of space.
You and Joanie can stay in my room

06:53.129 --> 06:54.687
and I'll bunk with Charlie.

06:56.899 --> 06:58.799
You'll bunk with Charlie?

07:00.570 --> 07:04.631
- Hold on there, Pecos Bill.
- No, it'll be fun.

07:04.707 --> 07:06.470
It'll be like when we were kids.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.541
Okay.

07:08.644 --> 07:12.478
But just remember, this time
Mom won't be around to hear you scream.

07:16.719 --> 07:18.346
Why are those people here?

07:18.488 --> 07:21.480
They're going through a tough time,
and we're helping them out.

07:21.557 --> 07:23.218
That girl is really annoying.

07:23.659 --> 07:28.756
- I think maybe she has a crush on you.
- Yeah, that's what's annoying.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.502
- You don't really like girls yet?
- No, I like girls.

07:34.837 --> 07:36.566
Just not into eight-year-olds.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.203
Is Joanie okay?

07:45.414 --> 07:48.349
Yeah. She fell asleep
as soon as her head hit the pillow.

07:48.451 --> 07:51.045
- It was a long day for her.
- Yeah.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.289
The good news is
I think my in-laws are going to back off.

07:56.926 --> 07:59.224
The bad news is
that wasn't my shrink's car.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.928
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.

08:05.101 --> 08:07.729
But at least you made this one
for the right reason.

08:07.803 --> 08:09.202
You love your daughter.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.605
I just wish I knew where to go from here.

08:15.545 --> 08:18.810
Because I know
I seem like I've got it all together,

08:21.417 --> 08:24.250
- but this is a little...
- Scary?

08:24.387 --> 08:26.753
Yeah. I understand.

08:26.822 --> 08:30.383
When my marriage ended, I was terrified.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.924
It's the unknown.

08:34.964 --> 08:39.991
- Yeah.
- No, don't cry.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.261
Everything will work out, you'll see.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.824
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.668
It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

09:19.242 --> 09:20.300
Come here.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.511
- Alan?
- Yeah?

09:59.682 --> 10:02.617
It's been so long
since anybody's touched me.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.318
How much did you see?

10:12.995 --> 10:15.293
Just enough to make sleep impossible.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.502
Okay, that's great.
I am dying to talk about this.

10:22.438 --> 10:24.838
All we did was kiss,
but, Charlie, what a kiss.

10:24.940 --> 10:27.374
It was like our souls were merging.

10:28.110 --> 10:31.273
- That was saliva, Alan.
- No, seriously.

10:31.347 --> 10:33.645
I mean, Frankie is incredible.
Think about it.

10:33.716 --> 10:37.243
First she loses her husband, then
she has to fight to keep her daughter,

10:37.320 --> 10:40.778
<i>and yet, still she has such incredible spirit,
such joie de vivre.</i>

10:40.856 --> 10:43.381
Okay,
would you like to hear my take on this?

10:43.793 --> 10:45.556
Is it positive and life affirming?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.223
Good night, Alan.

10:49.532 --> 10:51.523
Okay, no. Tell me what you think.

10:52.301 --> 10:53.359
All right.

10:53.469 --> 10:57.030
I've known you all your life,
and if there's one thing I've noticed,

10:57.139 --> 10:59.699
you are a stone sucker
for the damsel in distress.

10:59.809 --> 11:02.334
- I am not.
- Come on, Alan.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.504
Every woman
you've ever been involved with

11:04.580 --> 11:05.842
has been damaged and needy.

11:05.915 --> 11:10.045
Wait, what about... Okay, go on.

11:11.153 --> 11:14.179
You devote all your time and energy
into fixing them up

11:14.390 --> 11:16.085
instead of doing the humane thing,

11:16.192 --> 11:18.683
which is to have sex with them
and run away.

11:19.528 --> 11:22.019
Exactly how is that the humane thing?

11:22.098 --> 11:26.034
My way, they have a good time,
you have a good time, nobody suffers.

11:26.235 --> 11:30.171
Your way, you get married,
you take over their lives,

11:30.239 --> 11:33.106
they start to hate you,
and you end up moving in with me.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.504
You know what, Charlie?
I think you're jealous.

11:37.713 --> 11:40.045
- Of who?
- Of me.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.414
For the first time in our lives,
a woman picked me

11:42.518 --> 11:44.179
over you, and you can't deal with it.

11:44.253 --> 11:47.188
I can deal with it.
I don't get it, but I can deal with it.

11:48.724 --> 11:52.057
I feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry that your heart

11:52.128 --> 11:56.087
has become so hard and small
that you've lost the capacity

11:56.198 --> 11:59.599
to connect with another human being
on any level any more meaningful

11:59.702 --> 12:02.762
than the inebriated exchange
of bodily fluids.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.305
Boy, leave it to you
to take a beautiful thing

12:08.444 --> 12:10.878
like drunken sex and make it sound dirty.

12:13.082 --> 12:15.448
I don't know why
I even bother talking to you.

12:19.555 --> 12:21.386
- Alan?
- What?

12:21.757 --> 12:24.157
I thought we had a pact
to never go to bed mad.

12:27.963 --> 12:29.988
Leave me alone.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.961
Come on. Don't you want to spoon?

12:35.504 --> 12:38.234
I swear to God,
you are going to lose that hand.

12:40.409 --> 12:43.207
- That's not my hand.
- Mom!

12:50.886 --> 12:54.822
- Do you know where Jake is?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.

12:54.990 --> 12:58.551
- We're playing hide-and-seek.
- I don't know where he's hiding.

12:58.627 --> 13:01.562
No, I was hiding,
and he was supposed to find me.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.164
It's been over an hour.

13:07.169 --> 13:10.161
- Lf I see him, I'll let him know.
- Thank you.

13:10.573 --> 13:11.972
You're welcome.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.507
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:20.149 --> 13:21.173
Morning.

13:22.585 --> 13:23.609
Morning.

13:47.309 --> 13:49.641
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

13:51.313 --> 13:55.807
So, I thought maybe today, you, me,
and the kids might go do something fun.

13:55.985 --> 13:58.351
- What about Charlie?
- He's had his fun.

14:00.055 --> 14:01.488
I know. Why don't we go

14:01.557 --> 14:03.650
to Will Rogers State Park
and have a picnic?

14:03.726 --> 14:06.217
- That sounds nice.
- Great.

14:10.466 --> 14:12.366
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:21.043 --> 14:22.340
Oh, man.

14:23.679 --> 14:25.078
I'm the extra guy.

14:26.815 --> 14:28.976
Don't call yourself extra.

14:29.051 --> 14:30.541
- Try superfluous.
- Alan.

14:32.254 --> 14:36.384
- Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple.
- Alan!

14:38.027 --> 14:39.153
Interesting.

14:39.228 --> 14:41.719
- What's interesting?
- This is new for me.

14:43.499 --> 14:44.898
Don't really like it.

14:47.403 --> 14:50.702
- Charlie, you're a great guy.
- No, please, stop.

14:51.206 --> 14:52.935
Do not call me a great guy.

14:53.342 --> 14:55.435
That's what you call
the schmuck loser friend

14:55.511 --> 14:56.808
who has to dance with the

14:56.879 --> 14:58.710
hot chick's ugly cousin.

15:03.852 --> 15:08.551
- What?
- Nothing. Just having a really good day.

15:12.761 --> 15:17.255
- Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie?
- No. Couldn't find a date.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.459
Jake,

15:19.535 --> 15:22.231
Mom wants to know
if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch.

15:22.304 --> 15:24.295
- Tuna.
- Me, too.

15:28.477 --> 15:30.240
God, she's annoying.

15:31.547 --> 15:33.344
At least you're not a third nipple.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.281
Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen

15:36.385 --> 15:39.320
and help Joanie pick out some snacks
for the picnic basket?

15:45.327 --> 15:47.056
You sure you don't want to come with us?

15:47.262 --> 15:50.720
- Do you really want me to come with you?
- No, I was just being polite.

15:52.801 --> 15:56.259
Listen, Frankie,
we need to talk about you and Alan.

15:57.339 --> 15:59.239
Come on, stud.

15:59.642 --> 16:03.442
- You're not jealous, are you?
- No. Dumbfounded, maybe.

16:04.580 --> 16:07.640
Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted,
but not jealous.

16:08.817 --> 16:12.082
I just want to make sure
that you understand how vulnerable he is.

16:12.154 --> 16:14.748
You don't think I'm vulnerable, too?

16:15.024 --> 16:16.616
Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie,

16:16.692 --> 16:19.422
but I'm wrapped tighter
than an airport sandwich.

16:20.329 --> 16:23.992
Okay, let me put it this way,
my brother is crazy about you.

16:24.099 --> 16:26.431
Well, I'm crazy about him, too.

16:26.969 --> 16:29.802
No, you don't understand. Alan's a nester.

16:29.872 --> 16:32.841
He's already imagining
the two of you walking through IKEA,

16:32.941 --> 16:35.432
picking out flatware and throw pillows.

16:36.178 --> 16:38.408
- Come on.
- He did it with me.

16:43.285 --> 16:45.185
You really care about him, don't you?

16:47.189 --> 16:48.315
Yes.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.450
You're a great guy, Charlie.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.631
Great guy and a kiss on the cheek.

17:02.037 --> 17:04.300
Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls?

17:08.844 --> 17:10.209
- Want to play tag?
- No.

17:10.311 --> 17:11.643
- Hide-and-seek?
- No.

17:11.714 --> 17:13.146
- Want to chase me?
- No.

17:15.349 --> 17:19.650
- The kids are having a great time.
- This is a wonderful idea, Alan. Thank you.

17:19.722 --> 17:22.054
Hey, what makes it wonderful
is the company.

17:22.691 --> 17:25.558
Do you always say exactly the right thing?

17:26.528 --> 17:27.619
I don't know.

17:27.695 --> 17:31.564
I suppose I try to be sensitive
to the moment

17:31.667 --> 17:35.068
and weigh my words
so that they're emotional...

17:35.170 --> 17:36.194
No, not always.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.740
Listen, Frankie, I was thinking.

17:47.416 --> 17:51.318
We get along so well,
and our kids get along,

17:51.386 --> 17:54.321
and since neither one of us
really has our own place...

17:54.389 --> 17:55.413
Alan.

18:00.395 --> 18:01.726
Absolutely not.

18:03.932 --> 18:05.729
- But...
- No. My life is such a mess,

18:05.834 --> 18:08.234
and I've got to straighten out
a bunch of things

18:08.337 --> 18:10.532
before I can even think
about a relationship.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.573
Yes, you've got a lot of baggage,
but it's nothing I can't get to the curb.

18:19.281 --> 18:21.841
- What?
- It was something Charlie said.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.885
I was hoping you'd know what it meant.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.415
No. Alan,

18:27.055 --> 18:29.387
I talked to my brother in Seattle today,

18:29.525 --> 18:34.519
and he and his wife are going
to put me and Joanie up for a while.

18:36.932 --> 18:39.059
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.

18:41.637 --> 18:45.038
'Cause, you know, I can enroll her
in school there and get a job

18:45.374 --> 18:47.934
and start putting my life
back together again.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.807
Yeah, no. That makes sense. Sure.

18:52.881 --> 18:56.248
- I'm sorry.
- No. You're doing the right thing.

18:57.319 --> 19:00.584
- Look on the bright side, Alan.
- What bright side?

19:02.424 --> 19:04.255
You're going to get laid tonight.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.897
Oh, boy. I think I'm going to cry again.

19:18.841 --> 19:21.639
Okay, hon, the cab's waiting.
Say goodbye to Jake.

19:21.944 --> 19:23.741
- Bye, Jake.
- Bye.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.176
Oh, man!

19:29.484 --> 19:33.443
- Charlie, what can I say?
- I know. I'm a great guy.

19:37.826 --> 19:38.918
Oh, man!

19:41.363 --> 19:44.298
You know, I would've been happy
to drive you to the airport.

19:44.366 --> 19:48.860
No, it's better to say goodbye here,
because LAX is hectic and crazy,

19:49.004 --> 19:52.201
and the underwire in my bra
always sets off the metal detectors.

19:54.376 --> 19:56.606
You know,
this doesn't have to be goodbye forever.

19:57.346 --> 19:59.678
Once we get all settled,
you can come visit us.

20:00.916 --> 20:01.940
Sure.

20:17.599 --> 20:19.863
Bye.

20:40.122 --> 20:41.487
Here, I'm running late.

20:54.836 --> 20:58.795
- It's tough seeing her go, isn't it?
- Yeah. I'm really going to miss Joanie.

21:30.639 --> 21:31.833
