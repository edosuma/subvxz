TANYA MCQUOID: I brought
my mother's ashes with me,

59:53.160 --> 59:54.993
so I could spread them
in the ocean.

59:55.494 --> 59:56.452

I think I'm gonna be
a little emotional.

1:00:01.369 --> 1:00:04.827
MIKE WHITE:
You can sense there's just a lot
of internal drama about it,

1:00:04.911 --> 1:00:07.118
and it's like she's desperate
to get rid of them

1:00:07.202 --> 1:00:08.494
and she's also attached.

1:00:09.077 --> 1:00:11.702

I put my mother into the sea.

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:13.327
(SIGHS) Wow.

1:00:13.702 --> 1:00:15.410
I'd really appreciate it
if you'd be there.

1:00:15.494 --> 1:00:16.452
I'll take care of it.

1:00:16.827 --> 1:00:18.535
I'm sure one of the girls
would be able to cover for me.

1:00:18.619 --> 1:00:20.327
This is important.
I want to be there for you.

1:00:20.619 --> 1:00:21.869
Tanya sort of represents

1:00:21.952 --> 1:00:24.035
how we can all be kind
of a mess sometimes,

1:00:24.452 --> 1:00:27.661
and I think it provokes empathy
from Belinda

1:00:27.744 --> 1:00:30.869
and causes Belinda to let down
her boundaries.

1:00:31.869 --> 1:00:33.869
You were pretty horned up
this morning.

1:00:34.452 --> 1:00:35.577
Weren't you horny for me?

1:00:35.661 --> 1:00:37.827
It's just not
the most important thing to me.

1:00:38.702 --> 1:00:41.035
Well... what is?

1:00:42.369 --> 1:00:44.494
Was it the most important thing
to you?

It's up there. (CHUCKLES)

1:00:47.952 --> 1:00:50.661
There's humor to what
they're going through

1:00:50.744 --> 1:00:52.661
just because it's such
an obvious problem.

1:00:53.035 --> 1:00:54.619
He's not hearing her at all.

1:00:54.702 --> 1:00:56.410
All she wants is to be heard,

1:00:56.494 --> 1:00:58.993
but she doesn't know
how to get him to understand.

1:00:59.077 --> 1:01:00.786
I think Shane really loves
Rachel,

1:01:00.869 --> 1:01:03.410
but I don't think he digs
that deep.

1:01:03.661 --> 1:01:05.786
When he's happy,
the world is good,

1:01:06.243 --> 1:01:09.327
so some of the identity crisis
that she's experiencing

1:01:09.410 --> 1:01:12.118
and some of the anxious elements
to her, he doesn't get it.

1:01:12.202 --> 1:01:14.952
I wanna do something special,
something kinda romantic.

1:01:15.202 --> 1:01:18.243
ARMOND:
What about a candlelit dinner
on our charter boat?

1:01:18.619 --> 1:01:19.535
Oh, wow.

1:01:19.911 --> 1:01:21.118
ARMOND: There will be
one other guest on the boat.

1:01:21.202 --> 1:01:22.369
You won't even notice
she's there.

1:01:22.452 --> 1:01:24.243
She'll be quiet
as a church mouse.

1:01:24.410 --> 1:01:25.952
(SOBBING)

1:01:26.744 --> 1:01:29.327
Armond sending Shane out
on this boat ride

1:01:29.410 --> 1:01:31.285
is definitely calculated.

1:01:31.369 --> 1:01:32.702
ARMOND: He thinks we've ruined
his honeymoon?

1:01:32.911 --> 1:01:33.911
I will ruin his honeymoon!

1:01:34.327 --> 1:01:38.118
But I'm not sure if he would've
done it if he wasn't now high.

1:01:38.744 --> 1:01:40.993
It unlocks in the character
this ability

1:01:41.077 --> 1:01:43.911
to really act on what
he actually wants to do.

1:01:44.285 --> 1:01:46.952
Turns out you're my type.
I have my eyes on you.

1:01:47.285 --> 1:01:49.577
Later, Shane says to Rachel...

1:01:49.661 --> 1:01:50.911
He did it on purpose.

1:01:50.993 --> 1:01:53.619
People have been coming for me
my whole life.

1:01:53.702 --> 1:01:58.035
He is aggressive and entitled,
but realizing someone has been

1:01:58.118 --> 1:01:59.993
intentionally ruining
my time here.

1:02:00.077 --> 1:02:03.410
He's validated
in his exasperation.

1:02:03.869 --> 1:02:05.494
MARK MOSSBACHER:
I thought I knew my father,

1:02:05.577 --> 1:02:09.327
meanwhile, he's getting
manhandled by some random dudes.

1:02:09.702 --> 1:02:11.952
Mark is definitely
on a roller coaster ride

1:02:12.118 --> 1:02:14.702
with who his father was
and what that means.

1:02:14.786 --> 1:02:16.993
Gay, straight, whatever,
we're just monkeys.

1:02:17.243 --> 1:02:19.619
-Yeah.
-MARK: We're just animals

1:02:20.118 --> 1:02:21.786
driven by base instincts to...

1:02:22.952 --> 1:02:25.744
create these hierarchies
and hump each other.

1:02:26.118 --> 1:02:30.494
To Quinn, some of his struggles
seem ridiculous and unpleasant.

1:02:30.827 --> 1:02:32.077
Oh, I wish I'd known.

1:02:32.369 --> 1:02:34.744
FRED HECHINGER:
But some of it really is
interesting and moving.

1:02:34.993 --> 1:02:36.327
I'm sorry.

1:02:36.619 --> 1:02:39.369
In episode three,
he's really spiraling out.

1:02:39.452 --> 1:02:42.661
He's day drinking and starting
to chat up

1:02:42.744 --> 1:02:44.452
girls that are half his age.

1:02:44.827 --> 1:02:46.827
-Leprosy is no joke.
-It's not.

1:02:47.118 --> 1:02:49.827
WHITE: He goes on kind of
a dark day of the soul.

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:53.702
-(HOOTS)
-You're taking this really hard.

1:02:54.035 --> 1:02:56.285
In the end, you realize
what he's really looking for

1:02:56.369 --> 1:02:58.744
is some kind
of masculine validation.

1:02:58.827 --> 1:02:59.952
Get off me.

1:03:03.285 --> 1:03:04.369
Can I take these?

1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:06.494
Yes, thank you.

1:03:07.661 --> 1:03:10.786
Kai is a young gentleman
from Hawaii

1:03:10.869 --> 1:03:13.035
who works at the White Lotus.

1:03:13.202 --> 1:03:15.619
Paula, as soon as she sees him,

1:03:15.702 --> 1:03:17.869
is instantly drawn to him
and attracted to him

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:22.243
and does not really disclose
that to Olivia.

1:03:22.744 --> 1:03:23.869
Where were you?

1:03:24.869 --> 1:03:26.035
I just walked around.

1:03:26.285 --> 1:03:27.869
WHITE: They're sort of twinning
at the beginning,

1:03:27.952 --> 1:03:30.494
but then you realize,
over the course of the show,

1:03:30.577 --> 1:03:32.744
that there's actually a big gap
between them

1:03:32.827 --> 1:03:36.619
that grows as the mysteries
of their relationship unfold.

1:03:36.702 --> 1:03:39.702
You can see how
everyone's behavior

1:03:39.993 --> 1:03:44.410
affects each other and how
these relationships have

1:03:44.494 --> 1:03:47.243
slowly evolved
because of who each

1:03:47.327 --> 1:03:49.369
of these people are
and how they treat one another.
