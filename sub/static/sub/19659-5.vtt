WEBVTT

00:06.067 --> 00:06.500
Mate, I'm pretty sure
I can smell booze on you.

00:06.567 --> 00:07.333
Don't you not drink?

00:07.400 --> 00:09.333
I have the odd drink now.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
Okay.

00:10.467 --> 00:11.867
Well, I'm not
moving back here.

00:11.933 --> 00:13.567
I don't want to die
in Walthamstow.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.967
You're not gonna die,
and this isn't Walthamstow.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.967
- This is Douglas.
- Aloha.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.933
Harita:
She said you told her that
she was too beautiful

00:22.000 --> 00:24.333
to work in the same
building as you.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.700
Well, she told me that she
wanted to suck my cock

00:27.767 --> 00:29.133
until I passed out.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.500
That kind of language
is utterly inappropriate.

00:31.567 --> 00:32.533
I fuckin' agree.

00:34.633 --> 00:37.067
Harita:
Plus, none of the autopsies
showed conclusively

00:37.133 --> 00:39.000
that it was triolaphan
that killed those guys.

00:39.067 --> 00:43.533
But it's time for us
to tell the British public
we're sorry.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.567
Though we can't
actually say that.

00:45.633 --> 00:48.067
In other news,
it's great to welcome
Rob Norris

00:48.133 --> 00:49.467
and his creative eye back.

00:49.533 --> 00:52.267
Rob's been in Montreal
these past few weeks

00:52.333 --> 00:54.733
teaching a course in
pharmaceutical marketing

00:54.800 --> 00:57.267
at McGill University's
School of Business.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.900
Good to have you back, Rob.

00:58.967 --> 01:01.067
It's good to be back.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.467
Uh, I very much appreciate
that gesture,

01:03.533 --> 01:04.633
but we can't--

01:04.700 --> 01:06.100
I massaged
the truth a bit,
so what?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.967
Thought it might be
easier that way.

01:08.033 --> 01:10.267
- Thank you, I--
- I'll see you at
the extended release

01:10.333 --> 01:12.033
transdermal
cyclobenzaprine meeting.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.433
We should come up with
an acronym for that,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.300
'cause it takes
a while to say.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.567
I just wanted to say...

01:27.633 --> 01:28.933
I'm back from Canada,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.667
and it's good to be back.

01:31.733 --> 01:32.867
Okay.

01:32.933 --> 01:35.333
All right.
I'll see you around.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.600
**

01:45.833 --> 01:47.367
[knocking]

01:47.433 --> 01:49.567
Fergal:
Mate, are you gonna
be there for a while?

01:49.633 --> 01:51.667
There's a toilet
downstairs.

01:51.733 --> 01:53.233
That seat's rickety.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.733
You might want to
get it fixed.

01:57.233 --> 01:59.633
Huh. Just winding you up.

01:59.700 --> 02:00.633
Good one.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.233
Ooh. Jesus!

02:05.400 --> 02:07.733
Seriously, you might need
to see a doctor.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.167
He needs to not be
in this house anymore.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.300
What's he done now?

02:12.367 --> 02:13.767
One of my core beliefs
is that

02:13.833 --> 02:16.200
I should be able to
take a shit in my own home

02:16.267 --> 02:18.067
without being bothered
by a stranger.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.300
He's doing you a favor.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.167
Seriously,
it cannot be good for you

02:21.233 --> 02:23.400
sitting like that for hours
with your arsehole open.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.133
Something's gonna
fall out one day.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.267
- Or crawl in.
- [chuckles]

02:27.333 --> 02:29.533
- What time are you up?
- I gotta get in early.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.400
We have some MPs coming in
that we have to bribe.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.200
We fucked up on
a clinical trial

02:34.267 --> 02:35.333
and a little girl
in Sheffield

02:35.400 --> 02:36.700
grew an ear on her neck.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.167
Yeah, but that's when
you were on leave, right?

02:38.233 --> 02:40.033
Yeah, I never would have
signed off on that.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.767
[chuckles]

02:41.833 --> 02:43.767
What's it like
being back?

02:43.833 --> 02:46.033
- Is it horrible?
- It's not wonderful.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.633
Well, if it's
any consolation,

02:47.700 --> 02:50.100
you going back to
a job you hate so we
don't lose our home

02:50.167 --> 02:52.200
gives me
the massive horn.

02:52.267 --> 02:53.467
That does sound nice.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.567
I don't mean right now.
Not now.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.033
Had a big dinner.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.767
Do you feel bad that
neither of us

02:59.833 --> 03:01.533
is gonna be
with the kids now?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.367
I mean,
I went back to work and
they had to get used to you,

03:03.433 --> 03:05.533
and now you're, like,
fuck you, I'm off, too.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.967
What, fuck you,
I need to earn money
to support my family?

03:09.033 --> 03:10.400
That's the opposite
of fuck you.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.700
- Fuck you.
- Fuck off.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.100
[chuckles]

03:14.167 --> 03:15.467
We need to sort out
a child minder, though.

03:15.533 --> 03:17.633
Like a proper child minder
if we're both working.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.300
It was all right when
Anna was our babysitter.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.567
I mean,
you're babysitter's
supposed to be shit.

03:21.633 --> 03:23.200
Yeah, all they have to do
is put 'em to bed,

03:23.267 --> 03:24.600
and then just sit there.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.133
She doesn't just sit there.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.767
You know when we went
to see "Jason Bourne"?

03:27.833 --> 03:30.533
When we got back, the living
room smelled of sex.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.500
No, it didn't.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.933
Well, it at least
smelled of solo sex.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.167
Maybe she just microwaved
a Findus Crispy pancake.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.800
[chuckles]
What's that thing
on her neck now?

03:39.867 --> 03:41.067
Is that a wound dressing?

03:41.133 --> 03:42.467
Oh, I thought it was
a nicotine patch.

03:42.533 --> 03:45.067
Well, whatever it is,
I don't want Muireann

03:45.133 --> 03:46.567
peckin' it off
and chewin' on it.

03:46.633 --> 03:49.400
- [chuckles]
- [cell phone rings]

03:50.867 --> 03:52.667
Oh, it's Mum.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.633
Hello.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.300
[woman moaning]

03:58.367 --> 04:00.200
- [knocking]
- Don't come in!

04:00.267 --> 04:03.367
Do you not see
the sock on the doorknob,
for fuck's sake?

04:03.433 --> 04:05.967
Look, it's a normal thing
that people do, okay? Relax.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.733
Dad had a stroke.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.000
What?

04:10.067 --> 04:11.733
On the plane.
[sniffling]

04:11.800 --> 04:13.033
On the way home.

04:13.100 --> 04:16.067
[sobbing]
Fucking Ryanair.

04:16.133 --> 04:19.233
**

04:22.467 --> 04:24.167
Ah, that's what that is.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.033
We-- We were wondering
what that was on your, um--

04:26.100 --> 04:27.200
Sorry to hear about
your dad.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.333
Oh, thanks.
Thanks for doing this.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.000
I've gotta
head over there and--

04:31.067 --> 04:32.933
Did you know him well?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.733
My Dad? Uh, yeah.
Yeah.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.967
So, you're going to
Ireland now?

04:36.033 --> 04:37.467
- Yeah, because--
- Yeah, they do it

04:37.533 --> 04:39.200
pretty quickly over there,
don't they?

04:39.267 --> 04:40.433
I mean, my Irish cousin
Mav, she died,

04:40.500 --> 04:42.467
and you know how you lot
do the open casket.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.433
- I do, yeah.
- Yeah, well, she was
still warm,

04:44.500 --> 04:46.733
and I thought
it was because she was
beside the radiator,

04:46.800 --> 04:49.333
but, you know, I touched it
and it wasn't even on.

04:50.967 --> 04:54.533
Well, my dad's not dead.
He just had a stroke.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.800
Oh, great.
Have a nice trip, then.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.533
Okay.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.067
[laughing]

05:03.133 --> 05:04.733
Oh, hey, Margaret.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.967
That's a nice blouse.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.333
Uh, I would buy that
for my wife.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.067
- Pardon?
- Tina,

05:10.133 --> 05:12.467
I also like your blazer.

05:12.533 --> 05:13.600
For my wife.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.600
- Top cupboard.
- Sorry?

05:24.667 --> 05:26.233
If you're looking for
coffee patches,

05:26.300 --> 05:27.700
- they're in the top cupboard.
- Thanks.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.133
Oh, and they're all good.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.100
I took the decaf packets
and threw 'em away.

05:31.167 --> 05:33.133
- Not on my watch.
- Strong move, my man.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.100
- Rafe Bales.
- Rob Norris.

05:35.167 --> 05:37.033
Yeah, I know.
I started a few weeks ago.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.300
I guess while
you were teaching a course
at McGill School of Business.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.967
Sure.
How you finding it?

05:43.033 --> 05:45.000
Good. I mean,
it's a good company.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.133
Good folks.
Tacos on the roof.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.267
- Tacos on the roof?
- Yeah.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.400
They do tacos
on the roof now.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.000
On Fridays.
It's awesome.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.000
Do you like tacos?

05:52.067 --> 05:53.533
Do I look like
I like tacos?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.900
You look like you enjoy a taco
from time to time, yeah.

05:55.967 --> 05:57.133
You better believe I do.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.267
Well, I'll see you
up there then.

05:58.333 --> 05:59.833
I'll just finish
making my coffee,

05:59.900 --> 06:01.300
and then I will
see you up there.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.100
- On Friday.
- That's what I meant.

06:03.167 --> 06:05.700
- Okay.
- All right.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.967
'Cause the real issue is
the ambulance from the airport

06:08.033 --> 06:09.733
got caught up in
the rugby match traffic,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.300
you know, it was an
exhibition match,
yeah, France-Ireland,

06:12.367 --> 06:13.600
so it was
a pretty hot ticket,
to say the least.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.767
And that was at the same time
the Ed Sheeran gig

06:15.833 --> 06:17.867
was getting out of
the RDS Arena,
so you know,

06:17.933 --> 06:21.567
traffic wise,
he couldn't have picked
a worse time to-- [chuckles]

06:21.633 --> 06:24.667
But, uh, anyway,
luckily, it wasn't
that big of a stroke.

06:24.733 --> 06:26.900
But, uh, because of
his stroke last year--

06:26.967 --> 06:28.667
What stroke last year?

06:28.733 --> 06:30.000
His stroke was
two days ago.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.933
No, no, no, no,
the first stroke.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.800
Uh, the dementia
you've spoken about

06:33.867 --> 06:35.500
is almost certainly a
consequence of the stroke
he had last year.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.400
What, this was
his second stroke?

06:37.467 --> 06:38.833
Yes.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.967
Oh, great.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.133
Oh, well, that--
that's great.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.000
Well, he didn't
want to make a fuss.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.133
And it wasn't a big one.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.533
It's not a fuss,
he's my dad.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.133
We need to know if
our father's had a stroke.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.533
You-- You're so secretive.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.533
What the hell?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.800
And what about you?

06:52.867 --> 06:53.933
What do you mean,
what about me?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.567
Well, you're hardly
an open book.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.867
You kept the fact that
you were seeing that
Sinn Fein counselor

06:57.933 --> 06:59.167
quiet for a long time.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.433
What? I was 18, and
it wasn't a Sinn Fein--

07:01.500 --> 07:04.733
I'm just saying
you're a bit of
a dark horse yourself.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.300
Jesus. Mum.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.100
Even medically,
I need to know, let alone--

07:08.167 --> 07:09.367
You know Dad and I
share genes.

07:09.433 --> 07:10.733
I mean, you don't
need to worry because--

07:10.800 --> 07:13.300
- I don't need to worry?
- No, I don't mean--

07:13.367 --> 07:16.767
Look, I need to know
if I'm gonna keel over
and have a stroke one day

07:16.833 --> 07:19.667
when I'm reading Frankie
the fuckin' Gruffalo.

07:19.733 --> 07:22.000
- Stokes aren't hereditary.
- Oh, shut up, Fergal.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.300
- No, no, he's correct.
- Oh, and you would--

07:25.367 --> 07:26.433
Okay.

07:27.433 --> 07:28.200
Thanks.

07:28.267 --> 07:31.433
**

07:31.500 --> 07:32.967
Honey, I'm home.

07:33.033 --> 07:35.000
Yeah. What's up?

07:35.067 --> 07:37.500
Well, uh, Fran told me
about Sharon's dad,

07:37.567 --> 07:39.733
and her going to Ireland
and leaving you all alone,

07:39.800 --> 07:42.333
so I thought I'd check in,
make sure you hadn't gone
full Winehouse.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.033
Look, Chris,
I don't need--

07:44.100 --> 07:45.767
You told me more than once
you had a problem with booze,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.967
and when somebody
tells you something
about themselves,

07:48.033 --> 07:50.133
I've learned it's
a good idea to listen.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.633
Look, there's a spectrum
that we're all on--

07:53.700 --> 07:55.033
A spectrum?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.700
Christ,
I haven't drunk today.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.867
Do you want to
smell my breath?

07:57.933 --> 07:59.967
No. You want to
smell my balls?

08:00.033 --> 08:02.800
No, uh, but let me
make you a cup of tea.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.500
No, thank you.
I have miles to go
before I sleep.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.633
I like your tattoo,
what is it?

08:10.700 --> 08:12.767
It's a female panther.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.633
I like your jacket.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.200
All right,
let's go in.

08:16.267 --> 08:19.367
**

08:21.967 --> 08:23.167
Carol:
I should have known
when he said

08:23.233 --> 08:24.633
he could smell
strawberries.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.033
Fresh fruit on Ryanair.
That'll never happen.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.367
Some chance.

08:28.433 --> 08:30.033
They didn't even make
an announcement.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.300
But credit to Des,
he did stroke quite quietly.

08:33.367 --> 08:34.467
He doesn't like to
make a fuss.

08:34.533 --> 08:36.000
When Harry
had his stroke,

08:36.067 --> 08:37.633
he knocked over
a display pyramid

08:37.700 --> 08:39.267
of Pepsi Max
in the supermarket.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.833
Well, there's no good place
to have one.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.167
Are you still in
your mum's place?

08:43.233 --> 08:45.767
Yeah. God.
Grimsville, Idaho,

08:45.833 --> 08:48.467
but still, it's only
a dart and two buses
to see the girls.

08:48.533 --> 08:49.967
Yeah.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.000
God, Fergal's
lookin' well, isn't he?

08:52.067 --> 08:54.133
I found this. Look.
[chuckles]

08:54.200 --> 08:55.967
Where's that from?

08:56.033 --> 08:57.333
Oh, Sharon used to be
a flight attendant

08:57.400 --> 08:58.700
for retarded slut airlines.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.100
[laughing]

09:00.167 --> 09:01.700
St. Mary's step's ball.

09:01.767 --> 09:02.933
Look at the state of ya.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.600
[laughs]
How are you, Fergal?

09:04.667 --> 09:06.100
I haven't seen you
since the wedding.

09:06.167 --> 09:08.167
Eh, all right.
You still with houseboat Harry?

09:08.233 --> 09:09.767
Oh, God, no, no,
I left him when he hit me.

09:09.833 --> 09:12.467
What?
You never told me that.
He hit you?

09:12.533 --> 09:16.133
Yeah. Well, I mean,
he hit me with the thing
he threw at me.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.933
Threw his
iPod shuffle at me.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.600
So I just left.
Left all my stuff,

09:19.667 --> 09:22.233
and I just walked out
in the middle of the night.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.900
- Well, I mean, that's great.
- Well, actually,

09:23.967 --> 09:25.367
I mean,
I went back the next night
to get my purse.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.033
Oh, no.
Of course.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.200
And to sink
his boat.

09:29.833 --> 09:31.100
I sank his boat.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.433
You still married?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.200
I just remembered
I left a joint

09:37.267 --> 09:40.067
under the floorboard
of my bedroom 20 years ago.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.633
[chuckles]
Well, what are we
doing down here?

09:47.300 --> 09:48.833
You okay?
Do you want a cup of tea?

09:48.900 --> 09:51.100
Oh, you're
talking to me now.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.400
Mum, I was never
not talking to you.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.667
I was just not
looking at you.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.467
I'm going to
check on your father.

10:03.633 --> 10:06.100
Fergal's looking well.

10:06.167 --> 10:08.033
Thank you.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.200
**

10:25.133 --> 10:26.133
Hi again.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
Man, you'd better
shut me off

10:28.267 --> 10:30.000
or there won't be
any carne asada left
for anybody else.

10:30.067 --> 10:32.533
That's a real possibility.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.467
- You can't beat this.
- You really can't.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.567
Costs about 600 pounds
a week to do,

10:38.633 --> 10:41.300
but in fact,
this is the type of shit
that makes your employees

10:41.367 --> 10:43.267
hang around two to
three months longer
on average.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.800
Which can save a company
tens of thousands
over a fiscal year

10:46.867 --> 10:49.000
in training
and recruitment fees.

10:49.067 --> 10:51.100
Also, people like tacos.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.967
How many tacos
have you had?

10:56.033 --> 10:57.500
- Oh, actually, I don't--
- Cheers.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.067
Thanks.

11:02.867 --> 11:04.800
[indistinct chatter]

11:12.467 --> 11:13.400
Hey.

11:16.033 --> 11:20.033
Hey. Chris.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.367
Remember me?

11:21.433 --> 11:23.833
I'm still legally married
to your girlfriend.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.067
Yeah, I remember you.
You want a beer?

11:26.133 --> 11:27.400
No, thank you.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.767
I just thought we should
have a little chat,

11:29.833 --> 11:34.033
because you're spending
a fair amount of time in
my house with my son,

11:34.100 --> 11:36.733
and I don't care for it.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.067
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.567
I'm not wild about you.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.767
I suppose you could say
I wish you ill.

11:42.833 --> 11:45.067
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.600
Although,
you have choices.

11:46.667 --> 11:52.100
The good news is that
you're at a fork in the road.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.000
One path,
the one that I recommend,

11:54.067 --> 11:55.333
could lead to
any number of places,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.567
some lovely,
some peaceful.

11:57.633 --> 12:01.167
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.967
The other path
is a bad path.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.733
If you were to choose
this path,

12:05.800 --> 12:09.667
you better hope
the next person to walk it
is a forensic dentist,

12:09.733 --> 12:11.600
so they can identify
your fuckin' skull,

12:11.667 --> 12:14.500
and your mother
has something to bury
in the family plot.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.933
Blah, blah, blah, blah
blah, blah, blah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.767
[indistinct]

12:27.833 --> 12:29.333
What are you gonna do?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.433
Bring along
a little stepladder,
climb up on it,

12:31.500 --> 12:34.233
and punch me in
the tits to death?

12:34.300 --> 12:35.833
Oh, you can save me the
"Braveheart" shit.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.533
Consider your goal achieved.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.800
Some nut job ex interrupting
my chicken Caesar wrap?

12:40.867 --> 12:43.433
Fuck that noise.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.933
I was gonna dump her
anyway.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.533
Now I don't even
have to do that.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.800
Leave Shelly a nice tip.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.600
She's my favorite
bartender.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.533
Oh, Dad.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.033
Where's my fuckin'--

13:53.133 --> 13:56.233
**

14:00.400 --> 14:02.433
Why don't I get
a fucking letter?

14:04.433 --> 14:06.067
Rob:
That's Mike.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.000
He's 28 and he's got
four kids.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.167
I think he's, like,
Amish or Mormon.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.200
Whichever one of those
does that.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.133
[chuckles]
What's her name?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.567
Rob: That's Tina.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.000
How much do you think
she weighs?

14:16.067 --> 14:19.000
I don't know.
70 pounds less than me.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.333
[chuckles]

14:20.400 --> 14:22.600
Okay, so say there's
a nuclear attack, right?

14:22.667 --> 14:25.133
And everyone's dropped dead
except you and Harita.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.667
How long before
you'd fuck her?

14:26.733 --> 14:29.467
I mean, that'd be up to her,
because I would never--

14:29.533 --> 14:32.200
Well, first off,
did my wife get killed
in this nuclear attack,

14:32.267 --> 14:34.833
because if she wasn't dead,
I'd go and try and save her.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.333
No, no, no,
your family are dead.
They died instantly.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.900
They were vaporized.
You know, it's painless.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.700
Oh, then I wouldn't be horny
because I'd be sad.

14:40.767 --> 14:42.267
Oh, all right,
Morrisey.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.767
[laughs]
Fat Morrisey.

14:43.833 --> 14:47.133
Oh, Jesus, come on, man.
Fuck, I'm not that fat.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.933
That's like the third thing
you'd notice about me.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.300
I mean, first,
I'm tall.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.033
Second,
I'm very friendly.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.133
And then maybe you'd notice
that I'm slightly overweight.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.733
[laughs]
Slightly.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.567
So, what's it been like
coming back after, you know--

15:04.633 --> 15:06.167
After Canada?

15:06.233 --> 15:08.600
After you got busted
for trying to bone that
French girl in your office.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.000
I didn't do anything
like that.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.567
- And how do you--
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.667
Everyone here knows
you got suspended for
sexual misconduct.

15:13.733 --> 15:16.467
It was a fuckin'
mutually agreed
leave of absence,

15:16.533 --> 15:18.033
and a misunderstanding.
All right?

15:18.100 --> 15:19.400
Keep your voice down.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.533
Bobby. Cat's out of the bag
on this one, mate.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.567
You might as well
make lemonade.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.933
[laughing]
Hello?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.067
Uh, where you goin'?

15:27.133 --> 15:29.100
I gotta let
the babysitter go.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.500
I'd wait half an hour
before I fucked Harita.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.367
[sighs]

15:44.133 --> 15:46.233
[indistinct chatter]

15:56.500 --> 15:58.233
Sharon:
This happens
all the time.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.700
I mean, I get looked over
every time.

16:00.767 --> 16:01.900
I'm a good daughter.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.067
I-- I sent
Father's Day cards.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.333
I-- I buy the
birthday presents.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.467
Do you know how he knows
when your birthday is?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.233
- Because I fuckin' tell him.
- [scoffs]

16:08.300 --> 16:10.333
I'm the oldest child,
I'm the first born.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.867
Dad's known me
four more years than
he's known Fergal.

16:11.933 --> 16:13.567
Well, maybe he was
writing yours and then,
you know,

16:13.633 --> 16:15.033
he had a stroke
in the middle of it.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.100
Yeah, maybe, but why did
he write yours first?

16:17.167 --> 16:18.633
My letter should have
come first.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.200
What if the last letter
Dad ever writes is to Fergal?

16:21.267 --> 16:22.933
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.567
What's ridiculous
is this family not
acknowledging the truth.

16:25.633 --> 16:27.633
Mum, I think what
Sharon's trying to say is

16:27.700 --> 16:29.933
- we can't handle the truth.
- Oh, fuck off, Fergal.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.800
- No, you calm down.
- I am calm,

16:31.867 --> 16:33.567
but this is bullshit.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.967
Do you know how it feels
to play second fiddle to
that prick all my life?

16:36.033 --> 16:37.033
- Hang on.
- Do you have any idea

16:37.100 --> 16:38.600
what that does to
your confidence?

16:38.667 --> 16:41.000
Do you know
how many terrible men
I've had to sleep with

16:41.067 --> 16:42.867
because Dad loves
that asshole more than me?

16:42.933 --> 16:45.067
Not-- Not many,
actually,

16:45.133 --> 16:47.133
but, you know,
this is really upsetting.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.733
I'm really upset.

16:50.067 --> 16:51.367
Where's all the--

16:51.433 --> 16:53.400
Where's all the photos
of me and my kids?

16:53.467 --> 16:54.533
There's just Fergal's
everywhere.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.033
It's like Fergal,
Fergal, Fergal.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.867
It's like a fuckin'
Fergal shrine in here.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.300
My hand's in that photo
and that's it.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.867
Actually, I don't think
that is your hand.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.067
You weren't there
that day.

17:03.133 --> 17:04.567
You don't send me
any photos.

17:04.633 --> 17:08.300
Mum, I constantly email you
photos of me and the kids.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.967
Yeah, what am I
supposed to do with those?

17:10.033 --> 17:12.833
Fergal sends me photographs
already framed.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.433
What?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.533
Oh, my God.
You're a psychopath.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.867
You don't send
a 65 year old with dial-up
a bunch of jpegs.

17:19.933 --> 17:21.567
That's like asking
a fucking haddock

17:21.633 --> 17:25.000
to do a suduki. Sudoku.
Whatever the fuck.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.333
It is--
Because he's the son?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.267
Does that make him
more important?

17:28.333 --> 17:29.800
I'm going to let you get this
out of your system

17:29.867 --> 17:31.200
and go and check on Des.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.900
Or is it because
he embezzled money
from my husband?

17:33.967 --> 17:35.600
Rob lent me money and
I'm paying him back.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.633
Or is it because--
Is it because you're
so proud of his bags,

17:38.700 --> 17:40.433
since his actual business
went under?

17:40.500 --> 17:42.067
Or is it because
he left his wife

17:42.133 --> 17:44.133
because he's
scared of Spain?

17:44.200 --> 17:45.567
Mum, I didn't tell you
about the business

17:45.633 --> 17:47.100
because I didn't want you
to worry about me.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.900
I want you to be
proud of me.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.933
I told Sharon because
I don't care what she thinks.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.667
And that stuff
about Mallandra,

17:52.733 --> 17:54.033
I mean, that was just--

17:54.100 --> 17:56.000
I didn't mean any of that.
You know?

17:56.067 --> 17:58.033
Dad getting sick
has changed everything.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.467
I'm going back to Spain.

17:59.533 --> 18:02.267
I just want to sell man bags
and be a good dad.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.567
Well, it's all out
in the open now.

18:07.633 --> 18:11.733
I am proud of you.
I always will be.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.833
He's got drugs hidden
under the floorboards
in his bedroom.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.333
**

18:23.967 --> 18:26.700
- [door opens]
- [keys jangling]

18:28.333 --> 18:29.433
Sorry I'm late.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.233
Do you--
Do you have my wallet?

18:33.300 --> 18:34.233
No.

18:41.033 --> 18:42.167
I have it.

18:48.167 --> 18:49.967
You're giving me--
You're giving me too much.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.767
[groaning]

18:51.833 --> 18:52.800
You all right?

18:52.867 --> 18:54.500
No, I'm gonna throw up.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.533
- Well, don't lie down.
- It's fine.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.667
I'm just gonna re--
relax a little bit,

18:58.733 --> 19:00.100
and do it later.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.533
Do you still need me
tomorrow?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.733
Rob.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.767
Did you make pancakes?

19:06.833 --> 19:07.867
Smells like...

19:07.933 --> 19:11.167
- fucking good.
- No.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.700
Look, Muireann's
not long gone to sleep,

19:12.767 --> 19:14.767
so just keep
an ear out, yeah?

19:18.167 --> 19:20.267
[baby fussing]

19:33.867 --> 19:34.833
[sighs]

19:34.900 --> 19:38.000
**

20:14.533 --> 20:16.267
Don't worry.
You slept there.

20:16.333 --> 20:17.633
I slept in
Muireann's room.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.567
All right, so the money you
overpaid me last night,

20:19.633 --> 20:21.567
just about covers me
staying over.

20:21.633 --> 20:22.567
I'll see you later.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.233
You should have a shower,

20:27.300 --> 20:29.600
or walk through a car wash
or something.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.133
You really smell.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.833
[door opens]

20:33.900 --> 20:35.167
[sniffing]

20:44.400 --> 20:45.667
Do you want a cup of tea?

20:48.100 --> 20:50.133
Great.
I'll have one, too.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.467
I'm sorry.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.600
[knocking]

21:39.800 --> 21:41.433
How'd you know
where I live?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.400
I've dropped you off here
like 25 times.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.667
All right,
fair enough.

21:44.733 --> 21:46.000
What do you want?

21:46.067 --> 21:48.967
You left these in
Muiranne's room last night.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.333
All right.
Thanks.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.267
Listen, I'm really sorry
about last night,

21:54.333 --> 21:57.133
and I'm not telling you
not to tell Sharon, but--

21:57.200 --> 21:58.700
I-- I ain't
tellin' Sharon.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.800
You think she fuckin'
won't kill the messenger?

22:00.867 --> 22:02.367
Right.

22:02.433 --> 22:05.433
And look, um,
this isn't a bribe,

22:05.500 --> 22:07.400
uh, or a pay off.

22:07.467 --> 22:10.267
It's just a way to say
thank you for--

22:10.333 --> 22:14.567
I mean, what you did
last night was--

22:14.633 --> 22:17.767
I mean, I always thought
you were a fine babysitter,

22:17.833 --> 22:18.900
but now I know--

22:18.967 --> 22:20.400
I can't feel
sorry for you.

22:20.467 --> 22:23.000
You know, I missed a date
because of you last night.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.833
Oh, man.
I'm really sorry.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.600
I-- I mean, you can always
go around there now maybe.

22:29.667 --> 22:30.867
Can I?

22:30.933 --> 22:33.567
Or do you think
his girlfriend's
around there now?

22:33.633 --> 22:36.000
I'm sorry.

22:36.067 --> 22:37.167
I--

22:45.567 --> 22:47.167
[sighs]

22:50.833 --> 22:53.767
**

23:03.167 --> 23:04.600
Daddy.

23:10.633 --> 23:11.567
[knocking]

23:15.833 --> 23:17.533
I need help.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.533
How did you know?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.700
How did I know what?

23:21.767 --> 23:23.767
He's dead.

23:23.833 --> 23:24.900
He died.

23:24.967 --> 23:28.367
- Fergal?
- Dad.

23:28.433 --> 23:29.867
My Dad.

23:29.933 --> 23:31.900
Oh, Christ.

23:31.967 --> 23:33.367
Oh, honey.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.733
