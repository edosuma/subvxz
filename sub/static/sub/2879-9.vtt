WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:02.761
They are not.

00:02.763 --> 00:03.895
They are, too.

00:03.897 --> 00:05.430
Your hypothesis is
completely disconfirmed

00:05.432 --> 00:07.032
by all the data.

00:07.034 --> 00:08.300
You're just clinging to it

00:08.302 --> 00:10.235
out of intellectual
stubbornness.

00:10.237 --> 00:11.903
No, you're displaying
a shocking ignorance

00:11.905 --> 00:13.438
of the subject matter.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.108
Mummies and zombies
are the exact same thing.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.477
Oh, yeah?

00:19.479 --> 00:21.813
Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

00:21.815 --> 00:24.566
That's called a fashion choice.

00:25.534 --> 00:28.486
All right,
you brought this on yourself.

00:28.488 --> 00:29.687
Sheldon, get him.

00:29.689 --> 00:31.539
If a zombie bites you,

00:31.541 --> 00:32.857
you turn into a zombie.

00:32.859 --> 00:35.193
However, if a mummy bites you,

00:35.195 --> 00:38.246
all you turn into is
some schmo with a mummy bite.

00:38.248 --> 00:40.081
So, like a zombie,

00:40.083 --> 00:42.133
that's been eaten
from the waist down,

00:42.135 --> 00:44.636
you, sir,
have no leg to stand on.

00:44.638 --> 00:46.087
Good boy.
Here's a cookie.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.889
Oh, thank you.

00:47.891 --> 00:50.208
Hey, fellas,
what's going on?

00:50.210 --> 00:51.976
Mummies and zombies again.

00:51.978 --> 00:55.263
Oh, they're not
the same thing.

00:55.265 --> 00:56.648
You get a cookie, too.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.316
Thanks.

00:58.318 --> 01:01.986
Guess who picked up his
new car this morning?

01:01.988 --> 01:03.554
Congratulations.

01:03.556 --> 01:05.573
Does it have that new car smell?
Yep!

01:05.575 --> 01:07.742
For as long as I can keep
my mother out of it.

01:07.744 --> 01:09.944
If you want to check
it out later,

01:09.946 --> 01:12.563
it's parked right out front,
space 294.

01:12.565 --> 01:15.283
I'm sorry-- 294?

01:15.285 --> 01:18.370
Yeah.
That's my parking spot.

01:19.505 --> 01:21.039
Why do you have a parking spot?

01:21.041 --> 01:23.108
You don't have a car.
You don't even drive.

01:23.110 --> 01:24.426
It doesn't matter.

01:24.428 --> 01:25.877
That's my spot.

01:26.762 --> 01:27.846
Maybe they reassigned it

01:27.848 --> 01:29.214
because you never use it.

01:29.216 --> 01:30.799
Well, I'm not using
my nipples, either.

01:30.801 --> 01:32.967
Maybe they should
reassign those.

01:32.969 --> 01:37.021
Sheldon,
someday, if you get a car,

01:37.023 --> 01:40.024
I'm sure they'll give you
another parking space.

01:40.026 --> 01:41.526
I don't want
another parking space.

01:41.528 --> 01:43.428
I want my parking space.

01:43.430 --> 01:44.446
It's perfect.

01:44.448 --> 01:45.763
It's a corner spot,

01:45.765 --> 01:47.148
cutting the risk of
door-dings in half.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.433
It's a mere 28 steps

01:48.435 --> 01:49.934
from the building entrance.

01:49.936 --> 01:53.321
The nearby tree provides shade
on hot days

01:53.323 --> 01:56.458
and is also home
to a delightful squirrel.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.076
Which is fortuitous

01:58.078 --> 02:00.778
because most squirrels
are real jerks.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.165
Fun story.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.584
Meanwhile,
you still don't have a car.

02:06.586 --> 02:08.235
Don't try to change the subject.

02:08.238 --> 02:09.721
This is about a parking space.

02:09.723 --> 02:11.673
It has nothing to do with cars.

02:11.675 --> 02:13.958
Are you listening to yourself?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.226
I always listen to myself.

02:15.228 --> 02:17.061
It's one of the great joys
of my life.

02:17.063 --> 02:20.231
Now, get your car
out of my spot.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.232
Nope.

02:21.234 --> 02:22.684
Very well.

02:22.686 --> 02:24.269
You leave me no choice.

02:30.410 --> 02:33.278

you stupid squirrel?

03:03.516 --> 03:06.585
President Siebert,
listen to reason.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.471
Yeah, I understand
I don't use the parking spot,

03:09.473 --> 03:11.156
but that's not the point.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.507
I...

03:12.509 --> 03:16.161
Yes, I'm aware you told me
not to call you at home.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.096
But you didn't answer the door!

03:18.098 --> 03:19.965
And I know

03:19.967 --> 03:22.300
you were there, because I saw
you through the mail slot.

03:23.686 --> 03:25.854
Well, that's some
salty language.

03:25.856 --> 03:29.024
May I remind you that you're the
president of a major university,

03:29.026 --> 03:31.526
not the president
of the Potty Mouth Club.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.445
There it is again.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.914
Do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

03:35.916 --> 03:38.867
Oh, well, I'm sorry
for your loss.

03:38.869 --> 03:40.702
Oh...!
Good night, sir.

03:40.704 --> 03:42.954
Unbelievable.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.507
He says Wolowitz deserves
my spot

03:45.509 --> 03:48.844
because he's a high-profile
asset to the university.

03:48.846 --> 03:50.011
Well, he's not wrong.

03:50.013 --> 03:52.163
Howard did go to the
International Space Station.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.665
Yeah, that was five weeks ago.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.967
How much longer
is he gonna milk that cow?

03:55.969 --> 03:58.103
Sheldon, let it go.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.521
It's not a big deal.

03:59.523 --> 04:01.690
No, no, this is
a slippery slope, Leonard.

04:01.692 --> 04:03.542
It starts with a parking space.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.843
Where does it end?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.194
It's like my dad always said,

04:06.196 --> 04:08.196
"First they say you can't drink
and drive.

04:08.198 --> 04:10.115
"Next thing you know,
you can't let your 10-year-old

04:10.117 --> 04:14.069
take the wheel while you sleep
one off in the backseat."

04:14.071 --> 04:18.957
All that story does is make me
feel bad for your mother.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.044
Leonard, you're my best friend.

04:23.046 --> 04:24.663
Why don't you ever take my side?

04:25.715 --> 04:29.367
Because I can never
understand your side!

04:32.037 --> 04:33.171
Give it back.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.306
I'm sorry,

04:34.308 --> 04:36.875
but could you be more specific?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.059
My Iron Man helmet.

04:38.061 --> 04:39.711
Koothrappali saw you take it.
Give it back.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.730
Oh, that.

04:41.732 --> 04:43.882
Well, see, I wanted it,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.718
and you weren't using it.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.989
Apparently, those are the rules
we live by now.

04:52.057 --> 04:53.391
Payback--

04:53.393 --> 04:56.027
it truly is the B word,
isn't it?

04:56.029 --> 05:00.532
Sheldon, that is a $500
limited edition collectible,

05:00.534 --> 05:02.501
and I want it back.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.704
I'd love to help you out,
but unfortunately,

05:05.706 --> 05:07.873
I'm using it.

05:12.378 --> 05:13.428
Fine.

05:13.430 --> 05:15.213
I'm taking your diploma.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.716
Go ahead.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.385
That's the only doctorate
you'll ever get.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.843
It smells funny in here.

05:29.061 --> 05:30.478
We're so proud of you, Amy.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.863
Your first bikini wax.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.982
Yeah.

05:39.322 --> 05:41.272
So, how you doing?

05:41.274 --> 05:43.375
A little sensitive, but not bad.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.109
Does it always
take that long?

05:45.111 --> 05:46.411
Uh, no,

05:46.413 --> 05:49.280
they usually don't have
to go out and get more wax.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.717
I feel like I'm
five pounds lighter.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.722
Really? Only five?

05:59.759 --> 06:00.926
Hey, anybody want a drink?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.160
Okay.
Sure.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.095
So, did you spend
last night hearing

06:04.097 --> 06:06.798
about this silly parking
space fight, too?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.317
For hours. Fortunately,
I couldn't understand most of it

06:09.319 --> 06:12.520
'cause Sheldon was wearing
that stupid robot mask.

06:12.522 --> 06:14.606
Howard was so angry

06:14.608 --> 06:16.708
I had to mash up Benadryl
in his ice cream

06:16.710 --> 06:19.110
to get him to fall asleep.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.695
I guess this is what we get

06:20.697 --> 06:24.249
for being with two
testosterone-fueled alpha males.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.450
At some point,

06:25.452 --> 06:27.586
they're bound to lock horns.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.371
I'm assuming these
are some kind of horns

06:29.373 --> 06:31.289
they bought at Comic-Con?

06:33.009 --> 06:36.027
I'm really sorry
they took Sheldon's spot away.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.262
He shouldn't have to suffer

06:37.264 --> 06:39.180
just because Howard's
such a big deal now.

06:39.182 --> 06:41.332
I know,
Sheldon should just let Howard

06:41.334 --> 06:43.134
have his little moment
in the sun.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.136
What's that supposed to mean?

06:45.138 --> 06:48.006
Well, Howard's never gonna
go to space again,

06:48.008 --> 06:51.843
but Sheldon
will always be a genius.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.612
You're right.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.147
And I'm sure Sheldon will get
a fancy parking spot again,

06:56.149 --> 06:57.449
if and when he makes

06:57.451 --> 07:00.018
a worthwhile contribution
to science.

07:01.237 --> 07:03.121
If and when?
Okay,

07:03.123 --> 07:05.457
maybe we should change
the subject. Amy, how are

07:05.459 --> 07:07.692
your lady parts?
Still chilly down there?

07:09.361 --> 07:10.795
Hang on.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.414
None of Sheldon's theories

07:12.416 --> 07:14.132
have ever been
definitively proven.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.135
My husband actually went
to outer space.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.154
That's an impressive
accomplishment.

07:19.156 --> 07:21.256
He's now an inspiration
to millions of Americans

07:21.258 --> 07:22.891
who know you don't have
to be special

07:22.893 --> 07:25.043
or even qualified
to go into space.

07:26.295 --> 07:29.297
You know, I remember the
first time I got a bikini wax.

07:29.299 --> 07:33.234
My sister did it with melted
Crayolas and duct tape.

07:33.236 --> 07:37.055
It's a bad idea...

07:37.057 --> 07:39.190
Gosh, Amy.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.059
I'm sensing a little hostility.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.911
Is it maybe because,
like Sheldon's work,

07:42.913 --> 07:45.664
your sex life
is also theoretical?

07:48.234 --> 07:50.418
Damn.

07:52.288 --> 07:54.422
Yeah, well, at least
when we do make love,

07:54.424 --> 07:57.241
Sheldon won't be thinking
about his mother.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.296
And yes, that is a cleverly
veiled reference

08:01.298 --> 08:02.580
to Howard's lifelong obsession

08:02.582 --> 08:05.350
to crawl back
into her spacious womb.

08:06.802 --> 08:08.553
Anyway, to this day,
I still can't see

08:08.555 --> 08:11.255
a box of crayons without
crossing my legs.

08:11.257 --> 08:14.192
I don't have to take this.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.195
I'm gonna go home and have sex
with my husband right now.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.865
Maybe I'll let him do it
to me in the parking spot.

08:22.051 --> 08:25.937
Which sounds dirty,
but I didn't mean it that way!

08:28.741 --> 08:30.441
Okay, here's another one:

08:30.443 --> 08:33.244
If a zombie bites a vampire,

08:33.246 --> 08:36.114
and the vampire bites a human,

08:36.116 --> 08:39.217
does the human become
a vampire or a zombie?

08:39.219 --> 08:43.038
Or a zompire?

08:43.923 --> 08:46.091
Sheldon?

08:46.926 --> 08:49.227
Cookie.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.229
I don't have any.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.897
Well, I'm not giving it away.

08:55.484 --> 08:56.818
Hi, Sheldon.

09:02.425 --> 09:03.942
He's in my spot.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.611
Leonard, make him stop
being naked in my spot.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.748
Howard,
what are you doing?

09:09.750 --> 09:12.283
He wasn't using it.

09:13.369 --> 09:15.754
And I needed a nice cool piece
of leather

09:15.756 --> 09:18.339
to wiggle my naked ass on.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.825
Get off there.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.560
Give me back my Iron Man helmet.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.012
Give me back my parking space.

09:24.014 --> 09:25.547
You don't need
a parking space.

09:25.549 --> 09:26.681
You don't have a car.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.183
You don't need
an Iron Man helmet.

09:28.185 --> 09:30.101
You're not Iron Man.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.905
Well, we appear
to have reached an impasse.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.023
And you know,

09:35.025 --> 09:36.157
I have to say, I thought

09:36.159 --> 09:37.559
you'd be more upset
that your laptop

09:37.561 --> 09:40.462
is sitting on my junk.

09:42.448 --> 09:43.731
I didn't pick up on that.

09:43.733 --> 09:44.949
That's a nice touch.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:59.247 --> 10:00.541
This is so exciting.

10:00.542 --> 10:01.925
I'm feeling all tingly.

10:01.927 --> 10:05.011
Although that could just be
my newly defoliated bikini zone.

10:05.013 --> 10:07.214
Keep a lookout.

10:07.216 --> 10:09.999
This place is swarming
with campus security.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.686
They will not
hesitate to scold us.

10:12.688 --> 10:14.855
Freaking pigs.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.695
Oh, yeah.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.681
Okay, now,

10:24.683 --> 10:27.183
pull your car into the spot
and let's get out of here.

10:27.185 --> 10:28.985
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?

10:28.987 --> 10:31.538
Yes, and be sure and put
on the emergency brake.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.240
Really makes these
things tough to budge.

10:33.242 --> 10:36.827
Before I park,
come in the backseat.

10:36.829 --> 10:39.830
I want to show you something
I had done today.

10:39.832 --> 10:42.549
All right, color me intrigued.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.156
What do you think?

10:49.158 --> 10:52.175
I think you're high
on paint fumes.

10:52.177 --> 10:55.762
And boy, that's a lot
of Band-Aids.

10:56.981 --> 10:59.850
Okay, Howard's mother
is in, like,

10:59.852 --> 11:01.384
every one
of your wedding photos.

11:01.386 --> 11:04.771
What can I tell ya?
She's a big girl.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.060
Wherever you look,
there she is.

11:11.062 --> 11:12.228
More coffee?

11:12.230 --> 11:15.081
No, Leonard's taking me
to a physics lecture,

11:15.083 --> 11:17.584
and coffee'll
just keep me awake.

11:18.704 --> 11:20.203
Oh, I'll get it.

11:24.458 --> 11:28.261
Oh, looks like someone's on
Team Bernadette.

11:29.630 --> 11:30.847
Where's Howard?

11:30.849 --> 11:32.799
He's not here. What's wrong?

11:32.801 --> 11:33.800
He had my car towed.

11:33.802 --> 11:35.552
It cost me $200
to get it back.

11:35.554 --> 11:37.103
Oh, no.

11:37.105 --> 11:39.439
Where was it parked?

11:40.975 --> 11:43.059
In Sheldon's spot.

11:43.061 --> 11:44.477
That doesn't make sense.

11:44.479 --> 11:46.262
Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

11:46.264 --> 11:49.316
Was it maybe in Howard's spot?

11:50.568 --> 11:52.402
Don't play dumb with me, sister.

11:52.404 --> 11:54.154
You tell your husband
he owes me $200.

11:54.156 --> 11:56.039
Well, that doesn't
make sense, either.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.123
Why not?

11:57.125 --> 12:00.160
Because I'm the one
who had it towed.

12:01.946 --> 12:03.413
You?

12:03.415 --> 12:06.666
Didn't see that one coming,
did ya?

12:06.668 --> 12:07.801
Oh, yeah?

12:07.803 --> 12:09.469
Well, you're not gonna see
this coming.

12:09.471 --> 12:10.804
Ow! Ow!

12:10.806 --> 12:13.340
Oh, my God,
are you okay?!

12:14.476 --> 12:16.476
What the hell
do you have in there?!

12:16.478 --> 12:18.762
Just my wallet, keys and
a coffee can full of change

12:18.764 --> 12:20.680
I've been meaning
to take to the bank.

12:21.799 --> 12:23.183
Don't move.
I'll get some ice.

12:23.185 --> 12:24.133
Are you okay?

12:24.135 --> 12:25.602
Get away from me
or I swear to God

12:25.604 --> 12:27.637
I will rip out what's left
of your pubes!

12:28.439 --> 12:30.807
Here.
Thanks. Ah!

12:30.809 --> 12:33.309
Amy, you think maybe this has
gotten a little out of hand?

12:33.311 --> 12:36.162
Gee, you think?!

12:36.164 --> 12:37.113
I do.

12:37.115 --> 12:39.499
Penny, Bernadette
and I are sorry.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.167
You hit her! What did I do?

12:41.169 --> 12:42.369
You had my car towed.

12:42.371 --> 12:44.287
You were parked in
Howard's spot!

12:44.289 --> 12:45.505
I was parked in Sheldon's spot!

12:45.507 --> 12:46.990
Sheldon doesn't have a spot!

12:46.992 --> 12:49.826
Guys, I think I need to go
to the emergency room.

12:49.828 --> 12:51.828
Okay, let's go.
I'll drive.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.297
You can see where the tow
truck scratched my car.

12:54.299 --> 12:56.165
The tow truck didn't scratch
your car.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.134
How do you know?
'Cause I did it!

13:08.145 --> 13:10.513
Morning, Professor Stevens.

13:10.515 --> 13:11.982
Don't look at that whiteboard.

13:11.984 --> 13:14.317
That's my math, not your math.

13:14.319 --> 13:15.702
Keep walking, nosey.

13:16.654 --> 13:19.322
What the hell
are you doing?

13:19.324 --> 13:21.074
Oh...

13:21.076 --> 13:25.128
You said I'm not using my space,
so... I'm using it.

13:27.999 --> 13:30.634
Okay, you need to move now.

13:30.636 --> 13:32.302
No, I don't.

13:32.304 --> 13:34.421
You can't stay there forever.

13:34.423 --> 13:37.340
Actually, I have a plastic baggy

13:37.342 --> 13:40.226
strapped to my leg
that says I can.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.646
Give up, Wolowitz.

13:42.648 --> 13:44.481
You've chosen to tangle

13:44.483 --> 13:46.516
with a superior intellect
you can't defeat.

13:46.518 --> 13:48.518
There is nothing you could
possibly do to...

13:57.745 --> 13:59.896
Those aren't gonna help you,
Sheldon!

13:59.898 --> 14:01.498
Oh, yes, they are!

14:01.500 --> 14:03.583
I mean, what?!

14:03.585 --> 14:05.752
I'm warning you, Sheldon!

14:05.754 --> 14:07.420
Your threats are empty!

14:07.422 --> 14:09.238
Nothing can move me!

14:10.508 --> 14:11.458
Stop that!

14:11.460 --> 14:12.842
Get out of my spot!

14:12.844 --> 14:13.760
That's it.

14:13.762 --> 14:15.578
I am calling campus security!

14:15.580 --> 14:19.265
You prepare for the
scolding of your life!

14:19.267 --> 14:21.084
What are you idiots doing?!

14:21.086 --> 14:23.186
He's trying to kill me, Leonard!

14:23.188 --> 14:24.888
Video games
and rock music

14:24.890 --> 14:26.723
have desensitized
him to violence!

14:28.142 --> 14:29.943
Would you please
talk some sense

14:29.945 --> 14:31.945
into your
lunatic roommate?

14:31.947 --> 14:33.530
You're both acting
like lunatics.

14:33.532 --> 14:36.533
It's just a parking spot.
It's not just a parking spot!

14:36.535 --> 14:37.734
He can't handle
the fact that

14:37.736 --> 14:39.703
I'm a bigger deal
than he is now.

14:39.705 --> 14:41.788
Oh, preposterous!

14:41.790 --> 14:43.373
I have been solely responsible

14:43.375 --> 14:46.275
for this university's six-loop
quantum gravity calculations;

14:46.277 --> 14:47.544
I have changed
the way we think

14:47.546 --> 14:50.880
about Bose-Einstein condensates,
and I am also the one

14:50.882 --> 14:54.134
who got Nutter Butters in
the cafeteria vending machine.

14:55.252 --> 14:57.170
Maybe you missed that news
while you were

14:57.172 --> 14:59.005
floating around like a goof
in outer space.

15:00.791 --> 15:03.510
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

15:04.294 --> 15:06.312
Can you believe this guy?

15:06.314 --> 15:08.648
What I don't believe is that you
tried to run him over.

15:08.650 --> 15:11.151
Oh, like you've never
thought of doing that.

15:12.186 --> 15:15.405
Don't hate me just because
I lived the dream.

15:16.641 --> 15:17.774
Hey.

15:17.776 --> 15:19.642
Sweet ride!

15:22.179 --> 15:24.364
What are you doing
in there?!

15:24.366 --> 15:26.950
Just breaking in your new car.

15:29.820 --> 15:31.921
Stop that!
You stop that!

15:31.923 --> 15:33.322
You know what they say?

15:33.324 --> 15:37.326
Revenge is a dish
best served nude.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.700
Hey, got a minute?

15:43.702 --> 15:44.884
Oh, of course, come in.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.943
This is an authentic Chinese
throwing star,

15:53.945 --> 15:55.195
and I must warn you,

15:55.197 --> 15:57.513
I have seen many people
throw them in movies.

15:58.199 --> 15:59.816
Calm down.

15:59.818 --> 16:01.751
Howard has something he
wants to say to you.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.352
All right.

16:03.354 --> 16:10.126
Sheldon, when this whole thing
with the parking space started,

16:10.128 --> 16:14.531
I had no idea just how much
of a crazy bastard...

16:14.533 --> 16:16.366
Howard...

16:16.368 --> 16:17.884
that's not how
we practiced it.

16:17.886 --> 16:22.388
I had no idea how much that spot
meant to you.

16:22.390 --> 16:23.907
Anyway, I called

16:23.909 --> 16:26.910
President Siebert and told him

16:26.912 --> 16:29.729
it's not worth fighting over
the spot,

16:29.731 --> 16:32.048
so you keep it, and I'll park

16:32.050 --> 16:34.417
in the structure
across the street.

16:34.419 --> 16:37.770
Well, Howard, thank you.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.058
It's quite a gesture
on your part.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.560
You've shown yourself
to be the bigger man.

16:44.562 --> 16:45.528
Thank you.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.097
Which I find totally
unacceptable.

16:48.099 --> 16:51.417
I must be the bigger man.

16:51.419 --> 16:56.039
Therefore, you may use my spot
until such time

16:56.041 --> 16:59.742
as I learn to drive
or get a Batmobile.

16:59.744 --> 17:02.629
Wow, okay.

17:02.631 --> 17:04.380
Well, thanks.

17:04.382 --> 17:06.715
I don't know
what to say.

17:06.718 --> 17:08.218
There is nothing to say.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.086
Except I'm the bigger man.

17:11.472 --> 17:13.589
I'm not kidding. Say it.

17:15.142 --> 17:17.026
Just say it.

17:17.028 --> 17:19.579
You're the bigger man, Sheldon.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.364
Oh, stop.

17:21.366 --> 17:25.652
And I believe
this is yours.

17:25.654 --> 17:28.204
FYI, if you wear that
into a bank,

17:28.205 --> 17:30.273
they will tackle you
to the ground.

17:33.277 --> 17:36.913
I'd like
to propose a toast--

17:36.915 --> 17:39.132
to burying the hatchet.

17:39.134 --> 17:41.668
To burying the hatchet.

17:43.587 --> 17:45.889
You know, I'm kind of glad
this happened.

17:45.891 --> 17:47.456
Me, too.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.510
In some weird way, I kind of
feel like it brought us closer.

17:50.512 --> 17:53.563
Yeah, everybody's happy.
Great!

18:04.943 --> 18:06.310
Can I help you?

18:06.312 --> 18:09.347
Yes. According
to information

18:09.349 --> 18:10.648
I gleaned from Yelp,

18:10.650 --> 18:14.585
you had great success when
a santeriasuzy37

18:14.587 --> 18:16.487
brought you a pair
of leather slacks

18:16.489 --> 18:18.322
stained with chicken blood.

18:19.491 --> 18:22.543
I believe I may have
a similar problem.

18:24.596 --> 18:30.218
This cushion experienced
a nude revenge wiggle.

18:30.220 --> 18:32.670
A what?

18:32.672 --> 18:35.056
A naked man sat on it.

18:35.058 --> 18:36.841
Now, here's my concern:

18:36.843 --> 18:40.778
His diet is rich in
fatty deli meats.

18:41.747 --> 18:45.015
What test do you have
to detect lipid residue?

18:45.017 --> 18:47.902
Lipid what?

18:47.904 --> 18:50.688
Lipid residue.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.857
An anal autograph.

18:53.659 --> 18:56.828
A colon calling card,
if you will.

18:59.832 --> 19:01.566
Tuesday okay?

19:02.751 --> 19:03.701
Don't rush it.

19:03.703 --> 19:05.336
We may be dealing
with befoulment

19:05.338 --> 19:07.204
on a molecular level.

19:07.206 --> 19:10.174
Let me write
you a ticket.

19:11.743 --> 19:13.895
Is that your son?

19:13.897 --> 19:15.880
Uh-huh.

19:15.882 --> 19:19.016
Looks like that laptop's
seen better days.

19:19.018 --> 19:21.986
If you're interested,
I'm selling this.

19:21.988 --> 19:23.521
It's only two years old,

19:23.523 --> 19:25.273
16 gigabytes of RAM,

19:25.275 --> 19:27.358
Intel core,
i7 processor,

19:27.360 --> 19:29.193
and I can personally guarantee

19:29.195 --> 19:31.245
it has spent less than
20 minutes resting on

19:31.247 --> 19:32.530
an astronaut's penis.
