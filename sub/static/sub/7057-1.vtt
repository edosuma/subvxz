WEBVTT

01:44.981 --> 01:46.482
What can I do
for you this a.m.?

01:46.483 --> 01:48.109
We got oatmeal. We got ham.
We got omelets.

01:48.443 --> 01:49.526
We got ham omelets.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.403
I'll have a ham omelet,
please.

01:51.404 --> 01:54.531
More oatmeal, dude.
And try to keep it on the plate this time.

01:54.532 --> 01:58.577
Yeah, dude, more oatmeal. God,
and try to keep it on the plate this time.

01:58.578 --> 02:00.330
Chloe, sometimes you
can be such a bitch.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.039
Fascinating.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.416
Hey, buddy. Come here.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.876
I know it's 8:00 a.m.,
and you haven't had

02:05.877 --> 02:07.503
your triple-soy
decaf latte yet,

02:07.504 --> 02:09.589
but a kid with your kind of
breeding should have some manners.

02:09.756 --> 02:12.382
I suggest you apologize
to the lady.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.052
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.347
Oh, sophomores.
You gotta love 'em, huh?

02:17.514 --> 02:18.931
The usual?

02:18.932 --> 02:20.390
Yes.
That would be lovely.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.892
The race is at 4:00 today.
You gonna be there?

02:21.893 --> 02:23.143
Oh, gosh.
I don't know.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.354
I've got this really
riveting econ seminar...

02:25.355 --> 02:27.606
On the origins of the Gross National Product,
so...

02:27.607 --> 02:28.690
I wouldn't want
to miss that.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.693
Yeah, I would, actually.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.236
For the lady.

02:32.237 --> 02:33.946
Thank you, sir.

02:33.947 --> 02:35.030
I'll see you out there.

02:35.031 --> 02:36.407
Yes, indeed.

02:43.039 --> 02:45.207
Okay. C. Wright Mills'
<i>The Power Elite.</i>

02:45.208 --> 02:47.209
The main thesis
is what?

02:47.210 --> 02:50.587
That at certain institutions,
elite groups are formed

02:50.588 --> 02:52.048
that'll network the rest
of their lives.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.425
Well, then that brings us
to the question,

02:55.426 --> 02:58.428
is America really
a class society?

02:58.429 --> 03:02.684
Or is it the meritocracy we're taught
it is since we were in kindergarten?

03:03.143 --> 03:04.227
Mr. McNamara?

03:06.104 --> 03:09.607
Um, well, actually,
I believe that it's both, sir.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.608
How can it be both?

03:11.609 --> 03:12.943
Well, it's been
my experience

03:12.944 --> 03:14.987
that merit is
rewarded with wealth,

03:14.988 --> 03:16.947
and with wealth
comes class.

03:16.948 --> 03:18.615
Nice recovery,
Mr. McNamara.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.313
Nice car, ladies.
Tell me, when did you convert?

03:48.479 --> 03:50.689
Since we borrowed it yesterday,
Luke, as if you give a shit.

03:50.690 --> 03:51.899
Like you give
a shit, man.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.483
I don't believe you, man.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.152
I want you to
keep on stealing cars.

03:55.153 --> 03:56.987
When I'm a lawyer,
I'm gonna make a fortune

03:56.988 --> 03:58.488
defending all
my high school buddies.

03:58.489 --> 04:00.825
Starting with you three.
How you doing, J.J.?

04:01.659 --> 04:02.660
Your hair looked
better long.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.162
It's funny,
I was just thinking the same about you.

04:05.163 --> 04:07.165
I like it the way it is.
Thank you.

04:07.624 --> 04:10.792
See, Lukey?
Things do change, even for losers like us.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.377
Come on, McBride,
I never called you a loser.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.670
That's okay.
You got your books,

04:13.671 --> 04:15.672
your boats and
your Ivy pride, right?

04:15.673 --> 04:18.007
Right on, McBride!

04:18.009 --> 04:19.344
We'll see you around,
buddy.

04:30.730 --> 04:33.565
McNamara,
move this boat out or you're disqualified.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.026
Sorry, sir.

04:38.404 --> 04:39.988
Sorry, I'm late, man.
It's all right.

04:39.989 --> 04:43.283
As long as we're not late at the finish line.
All your hands on.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.535
- Ready, shove!
- Hoo-rah!

04:45.536 --> 04:48.080
Where did Mr. McNamara
learn to row?

04:48.081 --> 04:51.333
In local sewers, I imagine.
He's a townie.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.669
Mother died in a car crash when he was one.
Father, unknown.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.046
Ready, row!

04:56.214 --> 04:59.634
He won us the Ivy championship three
years in a row. That's a fact.

05:00.051 --> 05:02.053
He's growing on me.
Is that right?

05:05.056 --> 05:06.724
No need to check
him out, huh?

05:09.394 --> 05:11.436
Why,
it's Caleb Mandrake.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.940
He was a Skull
they day he was born.

05:15.692 --> 05:17.026
Caleb,
I can't see the race.

05:17.527 --> 05:18.945
Imagine it.

05:19.988 --> 05:22.948
<i>So sit back and let the starter
line up the boats here,</i>

05:22.949 --> 05:25.325
<i>as we get ready for the
beginning of the Ivy Sprints.</i>

05:25.326 --> 05:27.119
<i>Lane number one,
wearing blue jerseys,</i>

05:27.120 --> 05:30.122
<i>are last year's All Ivy champions,
the Bulldog Eight,</i>

05:30.123 --> 05:33.543
<i>led by the unbeaten team of stroke,
Luke McNamara and cox, Will Beckford.</i>

05:35.211 --> 05:37.504
<i>The promising Harvard
Crimson boat is in lane two.</i>

05:37.505 --> 05:41.092
<i>Stroke by Pat McCarry and cox
by Lisa Littlered Williams.</i>

05:42.093 --> 05:44.095
<i>This is the start
of the Ivy League Sprint.</i>

05:44.429 --> 05:47.348
<i>The start will be "attention,"
then the gun.</i>

05:47.765 --> 05:51.310
<i>Finishing out the field is Cornell
in lane three in the white and red,</i>

05:51.311 --> 05:53.895
<i>Princeton Tigers in lane four
in the orange jerseys</i>

05:53.896 --> 05:56.273
<i>and Dartmouth in the green
in lane five.</i>

05:56.274 --> 05:59.609
<i>Penn's on the outside wearing
blue and red in lane six.</i>

05:59.610 --> 06:01.195
<i>Attention.</i>

06:07.952 --> 06:09.202
Come on.
That's three.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.787
Push your legs.
That's four.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.914
Come on.
That's five. Push!

06:12.915 --> 06:15.625
Six! Come on. Give it to me.
Seven. That's it.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.128
That's eight. Come on, Luke.
Come on! Nine.

06:18.129 --> 06:20.505
That's ten. Come on, let's settle.
Lengthen and settle.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.466
I want you fellas
to give me two seats.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.343
Give me two seats.
We'll settle at 36.

06:24.344 --> 06:26.053
We'll settle at 36.
That's beautiful, Luke.

06:26.054 --> 06:27.471
Keep it right here, Luke.
Keep it right here, Luke.

06:27.472 --> 06:29.389
All right, that's nice.
We're looking great.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.433
<i>The Bulldogs take
a two-seat lead.</i>

06:31.434 --> 06:35.520
<i>Harvard and Cornell try to keep up with
them as they cross the halfway point.</i>

06:35.521 --> 06:37.814
<i>It looks like
another Bulldog victory.</i>

06:41.194 --> 06:43.279
Don't let them catch us.
Come on!

06:56.459 --> 07:00.003
That's five! That's six!
Come on with the legs!

07:00.004 --> 07:01.755
We got 'em. We got 'em.
We're walkin'.

07:01.756 --> 07:04.674
Keep it right here. Keep it right here, Luke.
All right, that's nice.

07:04.675 --> 07:08.221
We're four seats ahead.
This race is ours. This race is ours.

07:09.097 --> 07:11.223
We're men
with bad intentions, fellas.

07:11.224 --> 07:13.183
I want five with
bad intentions.

07:13.184 --> 07:15.352
That's one! Come on!
Bad intentions. That's two!

07:15.353 --> 07:16.895
Come on!

07:16.896 --> 07:18.355
What's going on
back there?

07:18.356 --> 07:20.357
George's oar lock broke.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.401
<i>The Bulldogs
broke an oar lock.</i>

07:22.402 --> 07:24.362
Okay, George.
Out in three.

07:24.529 --> 07:26.738
Toss your oar, George.
Toss your oar, George.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.699
One! Two!

07:29.409 --> 07:30.827
Three! Bail!

07:33.454 --> 07:35.330
All right.
Take it up!

07:35.331 --> 07:36.415
Come on.
Gotta take it up.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.583
Up! Take it up.
Take it up. Take it up.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.711
Seven oars against eight?
They don't have a chance in hell.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.463
<i>Wait.
I don't believe this!</i>

07:43.464 --> 07:44.590
<i>The Bulldogs
are still going!</i>

07:45.758 --> 07:47.092
Go! Go!

07:47.093 --> 07:48.677
Give all you got
right here.

07:48.678 --> 07:50.595
We're seniors.
We cannot let this happen.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.264
What do you say, Luke?
Take it up!

07:52.265 --> 07:55.434
Luke say it's a go.
Come on! Give me two seats.

07:55.435 --> 07:58.645
Give me two seats right now.
I need it now!

07:58.646 --> 08:02.567
Fellers, hands to ankles.
This is it. Commit now!

08:09.073 --> 08:11.075
Give it all you got right here!
Give it!

08:12.577 --> 08:15.328
Right here! Give it all you got!
We got a seat!

08:15.329 --> 08:18.498
Right to finish!
Come on, let's win this!

08:18.499 --> 08:21.460
We got five strokes!
Come on! Come on!

08:21.461 --> 08:24.087
That's two! We got a seat!
That's three!

08:24.088 --> 08:26.424
- That's four!
- Let's win this!

08:28.301 --> 08:31.052
That's it! We won it! We won it!
You guys are beautiful!

08:31.053 --> 08:33.013
Yeah!
We did it!

08:41.688 --> 08:43.566
Are the others
after him?

08:43.774 --> 08:45.776
He turned them all down.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.153
Either he doesn't want
to join a secret society,

08:48.154 --> 08:50.406
or he's waiting for us.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.035
<i>F-R-double-E
to be S-A-V-E-D</i>

08:55.036 --> 08:58.497
<i>S-A-V-E-D
from the bonds of S-I-N</i>

08:58.498 --> 09:01.625
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah
hip, hooray, amen</i>

09:01.626 --> 09:03.294
<i>Hallelujah</i>

09:03.628 --> 09:05.755
Go! Go! Go!
Yeah!

09:26.150 --> 09:27.567
Hey. Hey.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.654
Well, what's the matter?

09:30.154 --> 09:32.280
You gonna turn into
a pumpkin at midnight?

09:32.281 --> 09:34.991
Or are you worried you're
not gonna turn into a Skull?

09:34.992 --> 09:37.035
I'd join the Girl Scouts if
they paid for grad school,

09:37.036 --> 09:38.620
which the Skulls
supposedly do.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.705
Supposedly supposedly.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.582
I got my Harvard Law
application today.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.917
How much
they raise tuition?

09:43.918 --> 09:46.169
It's just over three grand
this year.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.754
Damn. Three grand?
Three grand.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.507
Which means that even with a
dozen or so part-time jobs

09:50.508 --> 09:52.968
and my scholarships...
Excuse me.

09:52.969 --> 09:55.512
I'm still gonna owe this
university let's say

09:55.513 --> 09:57.764
hundred grand,
110,000 when I get out.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.932
Don't forget interest.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.184
So,
even if I can get everything deferred,

10:01.185 --> 10:03.436
I'm gonna owe
this school 110 grand

10:03.437 --> 10:05.647
and Harvard Law like another,
what, 100, 150?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.691
That means you're gonna have to
get one of those really exciting,

10:07.692 --> 10:10.026
amazing corporate law jobs at,
what, 80, 90 hours a week.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.444
And then I could
afford a car!

10:11.445 --> 10:12.862
A used car.
A used car.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.447
And you know how attractive
the ladies find those.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.325
Which means you're getting no play,
even less than you get now.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.077
Which is like...
Like what?

10:19.078 --> 10:20.829
None.
Thanks.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.664
I appreciate that.
Right.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.165
So when I finally
do get free and clear

10:24.166 --> 10:25.917
to practice the kind of law
that I want to practice...

10:25.918 --> 10:27.627
You'll be 10 years
from a heart attack

10:27.628 --> 10:28.962
and a few more from the grave.
Precisely.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.046
Yeah.

10:30.047 --> 10:33.050
My future's killing me.
It's killing me.

10:39.849 --> 10:43.102
Forget about the Skulls.
Start this year off right...

10:44.228 --> 10:46.314
And tell Chloe
how you feel about her.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.859
Let's try to remain on planet Earth here,
shall we, William?

10:50.943 --> 10:53.070
Chloe went
to Miss Porter's,

10:53.654 --> 10:54.905
and I can't even dance.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.158
Chloe's parents...

10:57.825 --> 11:00.995
They own a private jet,
and I've never even been in a jet.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.456
You starting
to get the picture?

11:04.457 --> 11:06.834
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

11:10.129 --> 11:12.380
I went out with a
Skull freshman year.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.591
How'd you know
he was a Skull?

11:13.758 --> 11:15.258
Well, we got
into this argument

11:15.259 --> 11:17.677
about secret societies and how
they're different from fraternities

11:17.678 --> 11:19.638
because secret societies
are for life.

11:19.639 --> 11:23.224
So, I just mentioned the Skulls
and he got really uncomfortable

11:23.225 --> 11:25.393
and left the room
and never came back.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.937
Must be one of
their rules.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.230
Rumors are
they got lots of 'em.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.273
Rule Number One,

11:30.274 --> 11:32.568
not picked by midnight
tonight, not in.

11:33.027 --> 11:34.444
Here we go.

11:34.445 --> 11:37.073
Bow your heads,
the Skulls.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.868
It's tough to tell where the secret
society ends and the university begins.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.577
We know
you're up there.

11:42.578 --> 11:43.912
Yeah, we know
you're down there.

11:43.913 --> 11:45.121
Don't expect
an answer.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.082
The C.I.A. was founded
inside those walls.

11:47.083 --> 11:50.293
Yes, they were. But back in World War II,
when they were good guys.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.671
Oh, yeah, the good guys.
Say what you want.

11:52.672 --> 11:55.006
All I know
is that if it's secret

11:55.007 --> 11:57.468
and it's elite,
it can't be good.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.326
Ah.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.832
Gentlemen, come on, let's eat.
The pizza's here.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.627
Come on, baby.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.880
What's up?
What's up?

12:35.881 --> 12:37.049
Pizza's up here.
That's what's up.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.386
Hi, Lis.
Hi, Lis.

12:48.728 --> 12:49.812
Hey.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.359
<i>The time is now
12:00 midnight.</i>

12:56.360 --> 12:58.611
At least now we can eat, huh?
Yes. Eating.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.822
Oh, yeah.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.574
Yeah.
Get out of here.

13:03.659 --> 13:06.035
You're gonna have a heart attack at 30.
I can see it.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.746
- Hello?
<i>- Lucas McNamara, please.</i>

13:07.747 --> 13:10.373
Yeah. May I ask
who's calling?

13:10.374 --> 13:12.584
Luke, it's for you.

13:12.585 --> 13:14.211
He won't say who.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.632
How does anybody
know you're up here?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.092
Our secret must be
out, darlin'.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.927
Oh, shut up.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.012
Hello?

13:24.013 --> 13:25.890
<i>Are you ready
to be reborn?</i>

13:27.224 --> 13:28.767
Who is this?

13:28.768 --> 13:31.895
<i>Pay phone. Outside Ad building.
Forty seconds.</i>

13:34.106 --> 13:35.983
Who was that?
Luke, hey... Luke!

13:46.410 --> 13:49.079
<i>The astro lab. Twenty seconds.
Lose the bike.</i>

14:09.433 --> 14:10.768
<i>Windowsill.</i>

14:22.655 --> 14:24.448
Here we go,
McNamara.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.019
Guess this one didn't make
it through the reborn part.

15:36.145 --> 15:37.520
You better
check his breathing.

15:37.521 --> 15:40.608
I don't know.
Maybe he didn't react too well to the drugs.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.198
Where can I get
some more of that shit?

15:53.245 --> 15:55.664
Get up and shut up,
Mandrake.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.875
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.586
Congratulations,
Skulls...

16:01.045 --> 16:03.923
On your rebirth,
a Skull above any other.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.423
Say it.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.841
A Skull
above any other.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.135
Louder.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.261
A Skull above any other.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.680
No outsiders shall ever
know the work of the order

16:12.681 --> 16:14.724
or the composition
of its membership.

16:14.725 --> 16:18.144
Before you can enter our
world and begin your year,

16:18.145 --> 16:21.231
our council has a small
task for you to complete.

16:21.690 --> 16:22.858
You might call it a test.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.817
The university's
secret societies

16:24.818 --> 16:27.570
have been playing a little
game for over 200 years.

16:27.571 --> 16:31.283
Mascots. We steal theirs,
they try and steal ours.

16:31.909 --> 16:34.118
We have one left
for a complete set.

16:34.119 --> 16:38.832
At Snake and Skeleton Society.
Their mascot, a python.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.584
Is this so-called python
poisonous?

16:41.585 --> 16:42.586
Perhaps.

16:42.962 --> 16:44.712
But remember this.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.758
A snake without scales
shows its veins.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.344
You have until dawn.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.596
We have been watching.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.348
We will be watching.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.363
Go!

17:28.132 --> 17:30.341
We got a moat
and no drawbridge.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.843
These are
very strange people.

17:31.844 --> 17:34.638
So, gentlemen,
what are we waiting for?

17:49.611 --> 17:50.612
It's locked.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.823
Excuse me, gentlemen.

17:52.990 --> 17:55.034
Locks just happen
to be my specialty.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.920
So, what did you say
your name was?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.213
Luke McNamara.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.673
Caleb Mandrake.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.260
I know. I've been serving you
breakfast for last three years.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.344
I'm sorry.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.847
You know,
all you guys in the dining hall look alike.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.807
It must be the little
hats or something.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.186
Yeah,
must be the hats.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.023
Where in the world
did you learn how to do that?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.192
The skills
of a misspent youth.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.407
I used to be a genuine
menace to society.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.788
Well, there aren't
any snakes in here.

18:41.789 --> 18:42.872
Okay.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.626
"A snake without scales
shows its veins."

18:46.752 --> 18:48.128
They said...

18:49.379 --> 18:51.547
They said that the snake
was at the building,

18:51.548 --> 18:53.508
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that it was

18:53.509 --> 18:55.176
in the building.
In the building.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.385
Yeah.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.685
Shows its "vanes."

19:05.062 --> 19:07.481
Of course.
A weather vane.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.899
Let's go.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.081
Wow.
Yeah.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.752
You ready?

20:07.499 --> 20:09.792
This must be what they mean by
"a Skull above any other."

20:12.462 --> 20:14.463
Ready? Yeah.
Towards you.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.679
One more time.

20:29.104 --> 20:32.148
Hey! Don't let go, Luke!
Don't let go!

20:32.149 --> 20:33.942
Hold on, Caleb!

20:34.735 --> 20:36.236
Don't let go!
Hold on!

20:36.528 --> 20:37.654
Caleb, hold on.
Don't let go.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.200
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

21:00.510 --> 21:01.678
Luke!

21:02.054 --> 21:04.014
Hey, where's...
Where's Luke?

21:14.566 --> 21:16.693
You are a menace
to society.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.446
Oh, man!

21:21.156 --> 21:24.200
"The university's tenure system
only rewards mediocrity,

21:24.201 --> 21:27.286
"allowing our faculty..."
"...to wallow in selfish pursuits,

21:27.287 --> 21:29.997
"making secondary
their primary purpose.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.833
"Teaching undergraduates
to think."

21:32.084 --> 21:34.085
Bravo. That's a great
article, Will.

21:34.086 --> 21:37.505
Bob Woodward I'm not,
but give it time, give it time.

21:40.384 --> 21:43.720
Ah, hey.
Now, here's what I call the genuine article.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.931
What's happening,
you guys?

21:46.932 --> 21:48.641
So, what was it like
last night?

21:48.642 --> 21:50.811
What was what like
last night?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.895
Let me refresh
your memory.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.731
We were about to
eat tofu pizza

21:55.732 --> 21:59.819
when you got a call and ran out
the door like a bat out of hell,

21:59.820 --> 22:02.571
and here you are now looking like
you've been dragged to hell and back.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.656
So?

22:03.657 --> 22:06.576
It was just a really
long night, that's all.

22:07.035 --> 22:10.497
Really? Well, it must have been a wild ride.
Did she have a name?

22:11.290 --> 22:14.626
Uh, direct question, direct answer.
Are you a Skull?

22:17.421 --> 22:18.588
Are you a Skull?

22:19.464 --> 22:20.507
I don't know.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.509
You don't... You don't know.
I don't know.

22:23.427 --> 22:26.137
I don't know,
but in any case,

22:26.138 --> 22:28.264
and I know this is gonna
sound like a load of crap,

22:28.265 --> 22:31.560
but I don't really want
to talk about it right now.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.103
I mean, I don't mean
to be an asshole.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.230
You said it, I didn't.

22:35.772 --> 22:36.856
Will...

22:36.857 --> 22:38.941
No. You know,
for three years,

22:38.942 --> 22:40.818
we made fun of these
private school dicks

22:40.819 --> 22:43.280
that never gave us
the time of day.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.823
And now you're saying you're
gonna hang out with them?

22:45.824 --> 22:48.159
Will, this doesn't affect
our relationship at all.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.036
That's bullshit, man.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.204
How can you say that?
Two nights a week you're gonna be doing stuff

22:52.205 --> 22:53.789
you'll never tell me about,
never talk about, right?

22:53.790 --> 22:55.792
I swear to God,
this doesn't change anything.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.626
Oh, doesn't change anything?
Okay. Oh, great.

22:57.627 --> 22:58.794
Cool. Doesn't change anything.
That's right.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.464
That's great. Hey,
tell me everything then.

23:00.714 --> 23:01.881
Yeah. Yeah.

23:01.882 --> 23:04.175
Tell me where you went last night,
what you did.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.968
Why you're wet.
Come on, tell me.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.554
Yeah? That's right. Oh, oh, oh, that's good.
Walk away, walk away.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.432
We're just talking ourselves in circles here,
Will.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.143
Are you gonna say something?
Are you gonna back me up?

23:14.144 --> 23:15.478
Come on, Chloe.
Take a stance for once in your life.

23:15.479 --> 23:17.563
Tell him I'm right.
Come on, Chloe, tell him I'm right!

23:17.564 --> 23:18.981
Don't yell at her
'cause you're mad at me.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.441
Don't tell me how to talk
to my friend, all right.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.567
You're mad at me.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.486
Hey, come on!
Guys!

23:23.487 --> 23:25.697
Chill out before you say
something you don't mean.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.116
Okay?

23:32.996 --> 23:35.040
All right.
Let me say something I do really mean.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.833
Will...
No, Chloe.

23:38.835 --> 23:41.045
Hey, you and I were
at Maury's, right?

23:41.046 --> 23:43.214
Having a good time, drinking,
talking to some girls.

23:43.215 --> 23:47.009
And Caleb Mandrake and your
seven new friends come in.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.803
You gonna sit with them
or sit with me?

23:48.804 --> 23:50.346
Introduce me,
or is that against the rules?

23:50.347 --> 23:51.680
What do you know
about Caleb?

23:51.681 --> 23:53.766
You see, Chloe, he's already on a
first-name basis... No bullshit.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.185
How do you know
about Caleb Mandrake?

23:55.352 --> 23:56.560
Call it a guess.

23:56.561 --> 23:59.439
But Caleb's not the issue, all right?
The issue's us.

24:01.566 --> 24:02.567
What?

24:20.252 --> 24:21.711
Hey, Will!
Hey, Will!

24:22.546 --> 24:25.339
Will, we gotta work
this thing out, okay?

24:25.340 --> 24:26.716
There's gotta be
some middle ground here.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.718
No, see,
that's where you're wrong.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.805
When it comes
to friendship,

24:32.305 --> 24:33.557
there is
no middle ground.

24:40.564 --> 24:41.689
Hello?

24:41.690 --> 24:42.857
<i>Hello, this is
Caleb Mandrake.</i>

24:42.858 --> 24:45.110
<i>May I please speak with
Lucas McNamara?</i>

24:47.070 --> 24:48.196
Yes.

24:48.572 --> 24:51.116
Right away, sir.

24:53.243 --> 24:54.619
Caleb Mandrake.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.331
Will! Will!

25:01.751 --> 25:03.836
Hey, Caleb, can you
hold on one second?

25:03.837 --> 25:05.380
<i>No problem.</i>
Thanks.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.218
Listen, Chloe,
I'm really sorry, but...

25:13.430 --> 25:14.931
I'm sorry.

25:19.936 --> 25:21.062
Hey, Caleb,
what's happening, man?

25:22.314 --> 25:24.941
Well, we didn't have
to wait very long.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.735
<i>Why? What's happening?
You know something I don't?</i>

25:27.736 --> 25:30.279
Do me a favor and
check under your pillow.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.991
You might find a little
something from the tooth fairy.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.377
Congratulations,
Mr. Lucas McNamara.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.302
You too, Mr. Mandrake.

25:53.637 --> 25:54.888
You too.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.002
Who's first?

26:28.338 --> 26:30.465
I guess
they're expecting us.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.855
Kent Hodgins,
over here, please.

26:49.484 --> 26:51.444
Jonathan Edward Payne,
over here.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.864
Hugh Dalton Mauberson,
over here, please.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.492
Lawrence Thorne, here.

26:58.743 --> 27:01.288
Caleb Mandrake,
over here, please.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.417
Lucas McNamara,
this way, please.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.547
I'm Judge Litten Mandrake,

27:11.548 --> 27:14.175
and on behalf
of the council, welcome.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.804
In any fellowship,
you need someone you can trust,

27:18.346 --> 27:21.266
someone to be there
always and for anything.

27:21.558 --> 27:22.934
A soul mate.

27:23.893 --> 27:28.022
And my soul mate is Senator Ames Levritt,
class of '72.

27:28.023 --> 27:31.943
Gentlemen, you've been arranged in pairs.
Soul mates.

27:32.444 --> 27:35.488
Each soul mate was chosen
to complement the other

27:35.655 --> 27:38.158
and to accept responsibility
for the other.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.996
Mr. Wheeler.
Mr. Pitcairn.

27:46.916 --> 27:47.917
Thank you.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.252
Open them.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.507
Our membership, like life,

27:54.758 --> 27:57.260
has its pleasures,
its hardships

27:58.928 --> 28:00.430
and sometimes its pain.

28:01.264 --> 28:04.726
But unlike life,
the connection between you is eternal.

28:05.935 --> 28:09.230
Let this seal the bond
between you.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.652
Be silent
as you endure.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.351
Well done. Gentlemen,
put on your watches.

28:50.271 --> 28:52.064
With the council
as your witnesses,

28:52.065 --> 28:53.982
you have now become
soul mates.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.194
And now, gentlemen,
the rules.

28:56.861 --> 29:00.240
We live by the rules,
we die by the rules.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.700
Read your rule book.

29:02.701 --> 29:05.578
There's a rule for
every possible situation.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.956
Guard the key to our
entry and your rule book

29:08.957 --> 29:11.458
as you would guard
your own lives.

29:11.459 --> 29:12.877
Most important,
remember...

29:13.461 --> 29:16.506
Our rules supersede those
of the outside world.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.510
"A Skull above
any other."

29:21.511 --> 29:23.763
"A Skull
above any other."

29:24.556 --> 29:27.517
Well done, gentlemen.
Congratulations.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.102
As chairman
of the Order of Skulls

29:30.103 --> 29:32.187
and on behalf
of the council,

29:32.188 --> 29:35.525
and the 322 alumni throughout the world,
gentlemen,

29:35.817 --> 29:37.402
you are welcome.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.528
Welcome home.

29:49.873 --> 29:51.583
The proudest day
of my life, Caleb.

29:52.083 --> 29:55.128
Thanks, Dad.
I want to make you proud.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.352
Hey.
Hey.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.273
Thanks.

30:17.525 --> 30:18.734
They're beautiful.

30:18.735 --> 30:19.902
Just like they were
this morning

30:19.903 --> 30:22.697
in the ground
outside the dean's office.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.450
I thought women
loved fresh flowers.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.035
I messed up
with you yesterday.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.370
I'm sorry.

30:30.038 --> 30:31.247
Really?

30:33.082 --> 30:34.083
Feels like a bribe.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.381
Oh. What's all this?

30:40.965 --> 30:42.966
Luke McNamara,
Action Jackson.

30:42.967 --> 30:44.260
I named him after
Jackson Pollock.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.595
It's my senior thesis.

30:46.596 --> 30:49.515
I am teaching my
computer how to paint.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.767
Really. No, wait.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.195
Actually,
pure randomness

31:03.196 --> 31:06.074
is really what forms
the computer's creation.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.660
So am I the artist,
or is the machine?

31:09.661 --> 31:11.995
Are we both?
Maybe it's nobody.

31:11.996 --> 31:14.249
Or maybe it's chaos
in its purest form.

31:17.085 --> 31:19.921
Listen, do you have to stay
here while this thing paints?

31:20.630 --> 31:22.464
Do you think I can take
you out to dinner now?

31:22.465 --> 31:23.632
Yeah, you can.
Do you know why?

31:23.633 --> 31:27.971
Because Action Jackson chooses
when to begin and when to end.

31:28.638 --> 31:30.180
I am so getting
an "A."

31:35.979 --> 31:37.856
<i>I can say
I spent the night</i>

31:38.731 --> 31:41.024
<i>On the telephone inside</i>

31:41.025 --> 31:42.943
Since I'm buying tonight,

31:42.944 --> 31:44.945
how hungry would
you say you are?

31:44.946 --> 31:47.323
How hungry would
you say you are?

31:48.157 --> 31:50.158
I'm famished.
Famished?

31:50.159 --> 31:51.326
Mmm-hmm.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.912
Well, famished, famished is like,
what, 20 bucks?

31:53.913 --> 31:56.749
Which means that I'd
better get some cash.

31:58.126 --> 31:59.710
I should probably
check the balance.

31:59.711 --> 32:01.671
It's been a big week for me.
I bought a book.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.008
$20,000?

32:05.925 --> 32:07.510
That's got to
be a mistake.

32:09.304 --> 32:10.930
You are a Skull.

32:11.681 --> 32:14.017
Son of a bitch.

32:14.851 --> 32:16.477
I'm rich!

32:19.188 --> 32:21.232
Luke! Luke!
Hi.

32:21.733 --> 32:22.901
Yeah?

32:23.526 --> 32:25.069
You're a Skull.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.155
Chloe, I'm not gonna
disappear like that guy.

32:28.156 --> 32:29.741
Just please,
be happy for me.

32:31.701 --> 32:34.244
Fine. I'm happy
if you are.

32:34.245 --> 32:37.040
Good. When you're
happy for me...

32:40.877 --> 32:41.878
Yes!

32:58.061 --> 33:00.730
Gentlemen, if you'll
please follow me.

33:01.773 --> 33:03.732
Mr. Mandrake,
you will be in here.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.984
Mr. Mauberson,
you shall be in here.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.822
And, Mr. McNamara,
you will be in here.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.492
The rest of you gentlemen,
please follow me.

33:17.330 --> 33:19.040
Ooh! Whoo!

33:30.093 --> 33:31.594
Oh, hell, yes.

33:37.141 --> 33:40.103
That's Mr. McNamara.

33:44.357 --> 33:45.608
Hoorah!

33:58.246 --> 34:00.330
Are we having
a bit of tie trouble?

34:00.331 --> 34:02.083
Yeah.
Yeah, we are.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.877
No worries.
I am the king.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.674
It's a bit tricky.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.510
Especially when you're doing it
on someone other than yourself.

34:13.511 --> 34:16.597
'Cause everything
is in reverse.

34:17.514 --> 34:20.976
There we go. Nice.
Looks like you've done this before.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.895
You know,
once or twice.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.438
The skills
of a misspent youth.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.108
Thanks, man.

34:43.458 --> 34:46.085
Lucas, Caleb.
Come here a minute.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.591
Come here.

34:51.841 --> 34:53.675
Now, I have
this fantastic idea.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.094
Where did you spend
last Thanksgiving?

34:56.471 --> 34:58.514
Last Thanksgiving
I was in a Pizza Hut.

34:58.890 --> 35:02.184
Pizza Hut?
You're gonna spend Thanksgiving with us.

35:02.185 --> 35:03.602
We have
a Mandrake tradition.

35:03.603 --> 35:06.480
We hunt,
but we only eat what we shoot.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.273
So if we get skunked,

35:08.274 --> 35:11.234
then we spend Thanksgiving
drinking brandy and starving

35:11.235 --> 35:13.362
in front of
a crackling fire.

35:13.738 --> 35:16.616
But not to worry.
Caleb is a superb shot.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.244
Well, listen,
I would love to come.

35:21.245 --> 35:22.329
And actually,
where I come from

35:22.330 --> 35:23.455
we have
the same tradition.

35:23.456 --> 35:25.165
It's just what we shoot,
we call pigeons.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.751
Hmm. Ames.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.797
Ames, I'd like to introduce
you to Mr. Lucas McNamara.

35:31.047 --> 35:33.298
Senator.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.133
Pleasure's mine, Lucas.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.803
We've been waiting for that law
school application of yours.

35:37.804 --> 35:39.346
I'm on the
admissions committee.

35:39.347 --> 35:41.556
Ames,
you know that's inappropriate to discuss

35:41.557 --> 35:43.684
in front of
a potential candidate.

35:44.727 --> 35:46.728
You're right, Litten.

35:46.729 --> 35:49.023
So, Caleb,
what are your plans?

35:51.567 --> 35:54.070
I'm just treading water,
waiting to see what happens.

35:54.487 --> 35:56.739
Well, then your arms must
be getting tired.

35:57.573 --> 35:59.282
They are, Dad.

35:59.283 --> 36:02.203
'Cause you keep throwing me
into the deep end of the pool.

36:02.537 --> 36:04.580
Excuse me.
I need a drink.

36:13.798 --> 36:15.925
So, what do you think
of all this?

36:16.259 --> 36:18.761
Well, to be honest,
it's all a little bit overwhelming.

36:19.011 --> 36:22.097
It was for me too.
We share similar backgrounds, you and I,

36:22.098 --> 36:23.557
and I hope,
similar values,

36:23.558 --> 36:26.978
which could put this society's
influence to better use.

36:28.104 --> 36:29.437
Do you have
any questions?

36:29.438 --> 36:31.274
Millions.

36:31.607 --> 36:34.360
Like for instance,
who pays for all this?

36:35.111 --> 36:36.571
Rule 46 in your book.

36:37.071 --> 36:40.533
"Each member is required to leave a
percentage of his estate to the Skulls."

36:40.950 --> 36:44.077
And... And the word "war"
in the ritual room.

36:44.078 --> 36:45.745
What exactly is
the significance?

36:45.746 --> 36:48.540
Those who wish to become our
leaders choose the ordeal of war

36:48.541 --> 36:50.208
to prove themselves
worthy of the privilege.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.501
What if we're at peace?

36:51.502 --> 36:53.629
There are always wars
to be fought, Luke.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.300
You ever need anything, even if it's
just to shoot the proverbial shit,

36:58.634 --> 37:00.052
you call me.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.349
Caleb.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.435
There seems to
be a little tension there

37:08.436 --> 37:10.437
between your father
and the senator, huh?

37:10.438 --> 37:12.440
Yeah.
They were schoolmates.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.192
Soul mates.

37:14.358 --> 37:15.942
And it's gotten
substantially worse

37:15.943 --> 37:18.946
since my father beat
Levritt out for chairman.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.824
That must be tough, man,
trying to follow in those footsteps.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.869
Oh, he's an ambitious man.

37:25.828 --> 37:28.831
The idea of getting to the Supreme
Court's the only thing he loves.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.501
Speaking of love...

37:46.807 --> 37:48.475
<i>When dreaming</i>

37:48.476 --> 37:51.895
<i>I'm guided
through another world</i>

37:51.896 --> 37:54.982
<i>Time and time again</i>

37:55.358 --> 37:56.442
Uh...

37:59.028 --> 38:03.824
<i>At sunrise
I fight to stay asleep</i>

38:04.033 --> 38:06.910
<i>'Cause I don't want
to leave the comfort</i>

38:06.911 --> 38:10.039
<i>Of this place</i>

38:10.539 --> 38:12.832
Lucas McNamara, right?

38:12.833 --> 38:13.834
Yeah, how did you
know that?

38:14.377 --> 38:15.878
I know everything
about you.

38:18.256 --> 38:19.924
Care to dance?

38:23.469 --> 38:26.097
<i>So let's go there</i>

38:26.889 --> 38:29.474
<i>Let's make our escape</i>

38:29.475 --> 38:31.644
<i>Come on, let's go there</i>

38:32.812 --> 38:35.856
<i>Let's ask, can we stay</i>

38:36.941 --> 38:40.569
<i>Can you take me higher</i>

38:43.114 --> 38:47.743
<i>To a place
where blind men see</i>

38:49.203 --> 38:53.124
<i>Can you take me higher</i>

38:55.459 --> 39:00.256
<i>To a place
with golden streets</i>

39:00.673 --> 39:03.842
<i>So let's go there</i>

39:03.843 --> 39:06.011
<i>And let's go there</i>

39:06.012 --> 39:08.472
<i>Come on, let's go there</i>

39:09.890 --> 39:12.977
<i>Let's ask, can we stay</i>

39:14.770 --> 39:17.230
Hey. What's up, man?
You missed practice.

39:17.231 --> 39:18.607
Yeah, you know,
I've been busy.

39:19.275 --> 39:20.442
Doing what?

39:20.443 --> 39:22.153
Oh, it's a secret.

39:27.450 --> 39:30.202
Lookin' good with that left jab.
Big, tall guy like you.

39:30.411 --> 39:33.039
All the time. Attaboy.
Attaboy. Attaboy.

39:48.804 --> 39:52.475
No. No! No!

39:53.601 --> 39:54.810
No!

39:55.436 --> 39:56.812
No!

40:05.821 --> 40:07.490
Lucas. Lucas.

40:09.075 --> 40:10.533
Lucas,
I've been looking all over for you.

40:10.534 --> 40:11.826
I need to talk
to you right now.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.787
Uh, Chloe,
this is Caleb Mandrake.

40:13.788 --> 40:15.581
We've met at Exeter.

40:16.916 --> 40:17.958
Did we date?

40:18.250 --> 40:20.418
Once or twice.
You obviously found it

40:20.419 --> 40:22.171
as unforgettable
as I did.

40:23.047 --> 40:24.757
Um, catch up
with you later.

40:25.257 --> 40:27.218
Right. Sure.

40:28.677 --> 40:30.678
Look, Luke,
I feel really ridiculous,

40:30.679 --> 40:32.514
but I left my key
inside of you-know-where.

40:32.515 --> 40:34.391
I don't want to look like a
screw-up so early in the game,

40:34.392 --> 40:35.558
so could I please
borrow yours?

40:35.559 --> 40:37.812
Of course. But last
I checked, Caleb,

40:38.729 --> 40:41.148
they didn't kick people out
for being forgetful, huh?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.942
Thanks, Lucas.

40:48.364 --> 40:50.740
Dominating the entire room
in six-foot letters

40:50.741 --> 40:52.201
is carved
the word "war."

40:53.369 --> 40:57.248
The main room is about 80 feet across,
and it's magnificent,

40:57.540 --> 41:01.627
with nearly 10 pillars made
entirely of travertine marble.

41:02.128 --> 41:04.212
150 years of wealth.
I've never seen...

41:04.213 --> 41:05.214
You.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.090
Caleb Mandrake.

41:07.091 --> 41:10.886
You broke into my car,
you stole my key, you stole my book.

41:11.053 --> 41:12.804
Now I want the camera,
I want the tape,

41:12.805 --> 41:14.097
and I want
my stuff back now.

41:14.098 --> 41:15.765
Okay, okay. No problem, man.
Just calm down.

41:15.766 --> 41:19.769
Here's your key.
You can have that, but I got your book.

41:19.770 --> 41:20.895
I don't have it
with me, though,

41:20.896 --> 41:22.439
and we can get
that anytime.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.400
Okay?
But just calm down.

41:34.493 --> 41:37.746
<i>I'll be with you
till dawn. It's 2:45...</i>

41:41.083 --> 41:42.168
Will.

41:44.378 --> 41:45.713
Will, man.

41:49.550 --> 41:50.885
Hey, Will.

42:00.895 --> 42:02.271
Will! Will!

42:02.688 --> 42:04.815
Help me!
Somebody help me!

42:05.149 --> 42:07.318
Help me!
Help me!

42:42.561 --> 42:44.313
I don't understand.

42:46.815 --> 42:50.069
Will would... I mean,
he was the last person...

42:52.321 --> 42:55.824
Sometimes we don't know people
as well as we think we do.

42:58.077 --> 43:00.955
Look, I have
a few questions. Then...

43:01.205 --> 43:03.581
I think you should
get some sleep.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.251
Did you touch anything
besides the doorknob?

43:07.169 --> 43:10.464
I... I don't know.
I come in here a lot. All the time.

43:11.215 --> 43:12.840
Why were you here
at 3:00 in the morning?

43:12.841 --> 43:13.842
Do you work
for the newspaper?

43:15.177 --> 43:16.595
No, I just wanted
to talk to him.

43:17.346 --> 43:20.683
What would you have to talk to
him about at 3:00 in the morning?

43:24.311 --> 43:28.190
We had had an argument.
It was no big deal.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.485
So you had a fight.
What was this fight about?

43:32.695 --> 43:35.364
Don't put words in my mouth.
I told you we had an argument.

43:35.698 --> 43:37.448
We were roommates.
That's all there was to it.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.117
Whoa. Calm down.

43:39.118 --> 43:42.412
It seems like you're getting
a little excited here.

43:42.413 --> 43:44.498
What are you
trying to say?

43:44.999 --> 43:46.625
What are you trying to say?
Easy, son.

43:47.459 --> 43:49.377
I'm just saying
plain and simple,

43:49.378 --> 43:51.547
what was the argument
about? That's all.

43:54.883 --> 43:57.386
Detective Sparrow,
Martin Lombard.

43:57.553 --> 43:59.096
I'm the university provost.

44:00.389 --> 44:01.556
Do we have to
do this now?

44:01.557 --> 44:03.766
Can we give him
a break?

44:03.767 --> 44:04.934
I have a few
more questions,

44:04.935 --> 44:06.770
but maybe this isn't
the right time.

44:07.646 --> 44:10.316
I'll be in touch.
You can go, Mr. McNamara.

44:18.407 --> 44:19.908
Get some sleep.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.250
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

44:35.215 --> 44:36.258
Oh, my God.

44:38.552 --> 44:39.720
Lucas.

44:42.222 --> 44:45.267
I just heard. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

44:47.645 --> 44:49.188
What am I gonna
tell his mother?

45:09.124 --> 45:10.292
This should go too.

45:15.297 --> 45:17.132
Hey, uh, you want
I should pack these too?

45:18.676 --> 45:19.677
No.

46:42.050 --> 46:44.428
I have something
to tell you.

46:45.137 --> 46:47.765
Will was doing
an expose on the Skulls.

46:48.098 --> 46:51.101
He had a lot of interest
from a lot of papers.

46:51.393 --> 46:52.727
You know,
even job offers.

46:52.728 --> 46:54.229
I know.

46:54.563 --> 46:56.231
I found his notes.

46:59.359 --> 47:01.153
Why couldn't you have
told me about this sooner?

47:01.612 --> 47:03.322
Will made me
promise not to.

47:05.866 --> 47:09.202
If this article had something
to do with his suicide,

47:09.203 --> 47:10.453
I think the police
should know.

47:10.454 --> 47:12.079
They've been around
asking questions.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.707
You can't talk to them.

47:14.082 --> 47:16.418
Did this story have something
to do with Will's death?

47:19.463 --> 47:21.381
Did it?
I don't know, Chloe.

47:24.301 --> 47:25.761
I don't know.

47:34.019 --> 47:37.689
I guess if we were the friends
we thought we were, maybe,

47:40.567 --> 47:43.654
maybe things might have
turned out differently.

47:48.116 --> 47:49.827
I lied.

47:52.371 --> 47:53.705
Will lied.

47:56.959 --> 47:58.794
And now you're lying.

48:01.547 --> 48:03.298
You're lying to me.

48:04.299 --> 48:05.759
Move. Move!

48:24.820 --> 48:26.529
Detective Sparrow.

48:26.530 --> 48:29.491
Did you learn any truth
in class today, Lucas?

48:29.658 --> 48:32.243
Your girlfriend told us what
your fight with Will was about.

48:32.244 --> 48:34.328
She's not my girlfriend.

48:34.329 --> 48:36.956
Okay, then,
your friend who's a girl.

48:36.957 --> 48:39.000
We also found something
quite interesting.

48:39.001 --> 48:40.002
What's that?

48:40.210 --> 48:42.962
Will Beckford had a contusion
on the back of his head.

48:42.963 --> 48:44.589
Normally when people
hang themselves,

48:44.590 --> 48:45.798
they don't
have a contusion,

48:45.799 --> 48:48.718
like they hit themselves in the back
of the head with a sledgehammer.

48:48.719 --> 48:51.929
Clearly, something violent happened
to Will Beckford before his suicide,

48:51.930 --> 48:54.099
or what was made
to look like a suicide.

48:54.516 --> 48:56.517
Don't let it keep you
up nights, McNamara,

48:56.518 --> 48:58.185
because we're
doing our work,

48:58.186 --> 49:01.022
and I know how deeply
concerned you are.

49:01.023 --> 49:02.858
I'll get back to you.

49:04.401 --> 49:07.154
Unless you want to
get back to me first.

49:22.794 --> 49:26.381
He has got a left hook that
took a man out in 30 seconds.

49:27.758 --> 49:29.800
He has what they call
a puncher's chance.

49:29.801 --> 49:33.305
That is, if he gets inside...
He's not a boxer.

49:44.399 --> 49:47.569
Gentlemen. Tonight begins
the revealing process,

49:48.236 --> 49:49.905
the final stage of your
admission into the order.

49:51.573 --> 49:53.867
Come with us
into liars' hell.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.132
Gentlemen,
do come in.

50:14.846 --> 50:18.892
I'm Dr. Rupert Whitney, class of '73.
I'm head of protocol.

50:19.059 --> 50:21.728
I'll be your guide
for the next few weeks.

50:21.937 --> 50:25.899
The revealing process
is our most sacred ritual.

50:26.566 --> 50:29.235
It's been a Skull tradition
since the late 1700s

50:29.236 --> 50:32.780
and it is the foundation
of your class's commitment

50:32.781 --> 50:34.365
to each other.

50:34.366 --> 50:37.786
Each soul mate pair will be
placed within the device.

50:37.995 --> 50:40.955
And then you may ask them
any question you want

50:40.956 --> 50:42.999
about anything
that you want.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.462
The object is to learn all
that you can about each other.

50:47.629 --> 50:50.673
After they've revealed
all to your satisfaction,

50:50.674 --> 50:51.966
release them.

50:51.967 --> 50:53.802
Which pair wants
to go first?

50:55.303 --> 50:56.972
Caleb and I will.

51:20.203 --> 51:21.997
Hey, Luke,
what's your worst fear?

51:24.041 --> 51:25.542
My worst fear?

51:28.336 --> 51:30.672
My worst fear is that
I'll always be alone.

51:32.007 --> 51:33.632
My mother was killed
in a car crash

51:33.633 --> 51:36.053
when I was so young that I
can't even remember her face.

51:36.553 --> 51:38.679
My whole life,
I never had any family,

51:38.680 --> 51:40.139
up until
a couple years ago,

51:40.140 --> 51:42.141
when I met a friend who
became like a brother to me.

51:42.142 --> 51:44.018
And then last week,
he was taken from me too.

51:44.019 --> 51:45.936
Now, why do you think that keeps happening,
Caleb?

51:45.937 --> 51:47.438
Huh? Any ideas?

51:47.439 --> 51:48.857
I don't know, Luke.
Who can answer that?

51:49.024 --> 51:52.652
You can. You can tell me the
worst thing you've ever done.

51:57.616 --> 51:59.659
I had an affair with
my mother's best friend.

52:01.995 --> 52:03.872
Why are you so afraid
of your father?

52:06.041 --> 52:08.251
My father always
covers for me,

52:09.753 --> 52:11.963
always gets me
out of trouble.

52:13.423 --> 52:15.382
I never take responsibility
for anything.

52:15.383 --> 52:17.468
Fine. Then take
responsibility for this.

52:17.469 --> 52:19.888
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

52:20.138 --> 52:21.388
God, where do I start...

52:21.389 --> 52:23.224
Don't play games
with me, Caleb!

52:23.225 --> 52:25.393
What's the worst thing you've ever done?
The worst?

52:25.727 --> 52:26.852
What are you
talking about?

52:26.853 --> 52:27.896
I know what you did.

52:28.313 --> 52:29.563
What are you
talking about?

52:29.564 --> 52:31.983
Know where
I found this? Hmm?

52:35.987 --> 52:37.322
Thank you.

52:39.741 --> 52:41.159
I lost this,

52:42.452 --> 52:43.954
and I wondered
where it went.

52:57.592 --> 52:59.719
Gentlemen.
Congratulations.

53:05.851 --> 53:09.312
McNamara, Mandrake,
the chairman would like to see you.

53:10.105 --> 53:11.273
I'll be waiting
upstairs.

53:12.065 --> 53:13.692
He's a Skull.

53:30.458 --> 53:31.834
Would you excuse us,
Marty?

53:31.835 --> 53:33.170
Certainly.

53:37.257 --> 53:40.177
Well done, Luke.
Well done.

53:40.635 --> 53:42.303
Don't give me
your "well dones."

53:42.304 --> 53:46.140
I wanna know the truth about what
happened to Will Beckford that night.

53:46.141 --> 53:47.517
The truth.

53:47.809 --> 53:50.561
Well, I think your soul mate
has a right to hear the truth.

53:50.562 --> 53:52.189
Don't you, Caleb?

53:58.820 --> 54:01.573
Your roommate stole
both my book and my key.

54:02.157 --> 54:04.576
That's why I asked
to borrow yours.

54:04.993 --> 54:06.535
Then I went
to the ritual room,

54:06.536 --> 54:07.620
and he was photographing
everything.

54:07.621 --> 54:10.289
You broke into my car,
you stole my key,

54:10.290 --> 54:11.540
you stole my book.
I tried to stop him.

54:11.541 --> 54:13.334
Now I want your camera,
I want the tape,

54:13.335 --> 54:14.543
and I want
my stuff back now.

54:14.544 --> 54:15.836
Okay, now,
here's your key.

54:15.837 --> 54:17.588
All right,
you can have that.

54:17.589 --> 54:19.632
I got your book.
I don't have it with me, though,

54:19.633 --> 54:21.133
and we can get
that anytime.

54:21.134 --> 54:22.843
No, I'll tell you what.
You give me the key.

54:22.844 --> 54:23.886
Okay, I'll give
you the key.

54:23.887 --> 54:26.263
We'll get the book together.
You won't say anything.

54:26.264 --> 54:27.723
All right. Calm down, man.
Calm down.

54:27.724 --> 54:29.391
I won't say anything.

54:29.392 --> 54:31.311
Nothing'll happen to you,
and everything'll be fine.

54:31.519 --> 54:34.648
How about if I tell you
I can't do that, all right?

54:47.869 --> 54:49.204
Get off me!

54:57.045 --> 54:58.213
No!

54:59.547 --> 55:03.093
He fell,
and he broke his neck.

55:07.889 --> 55:09.098
Man, there was nothing
I could do.

55:09.099 --> 55:11.725
Nothing you could do?
You could've called the police.

55:11.726 --> 55:14.062
Caleb... Nothing...
Will is dead!

55:14.229 --> 55:16.063
We didn't go
to the authorities

55:16.064 --> 55:17.774
because we knew where
that would've gotten us.

55:18.066 --> 55:20.235
Caleb's future,
my judicial hopes,

55:20.777 --> 55:23.195
our obligation to the
Skulls to keep our oaths,

55:23.196 --> 55:25.115
all would've been ruined
because of an accident.

55:25.532 --> 55:29.159
So, we took this accident and
made it look like a suicide.

55:29.160 --> 55:33.414
Let's not forget,
Will Beckford illegally broke into a car.

55:33.415 --> 55:36.459
He's a thief,
and he trespassed where he didn't belong.

55:37.252 --> 55:38.627
This isn't right.

55:38.628 --> 55:43.425
Well, it may not be right,
but it worked.

55:52.017 --> 55:55.478
This is your preacceptance to
the law school of your choice.

55:57.314 --> 55:59.107
I haven't even applied
to law school yet.

55:59.274 --> 56:00.650
Imagine that.

56:02.902 --> 56:04.571
It's all paid for.

56:08.658 --> 56:11.328
I would do anything
to protect you.

56:15.123 --> 56:17.292
Won't you do the same
for me?

57:00.877 --> 57:03.837
Miss, would you bring me
another cup of coffee

57:03.838 --> 57:05.924
and some fresh milk,
please?

57:08.593 --> 57:10.220
Sorry about that.

57:11.137 --> 57:12.138
Excuse me.

57:17.310 --> 57:19.104
You took quite a risk
by calling me.

57:19.437 --> 57:22.689
You said to call any time I
wanted to shoot the shit.

57:22.690 --> 57:24.442
Remember, Senator?

57:25.610 --> 57:26.735
Do you know?

57:26.736 --> 57:28.696
I'm on the council, son.

57:29.114 --> 57:32.575
Even Litten Mandrake couldn't pull
off a cover-up like this by himself.

57:33.660 --> 57:35.370
Here you go.
Thank you.

57:38.873 --> 57:41.960
How are you managing with your
decision to remain silent?

57:42.710 --> 57:44.254
How are you managing
with yours?

57:48.425 --> 57:50.718
Our society's
a compulsive lot, Lucas.

57:51.594 --> 57:54.806
The Skulls are a group that
cannot help but dot every "I,"

57:55.432 --> 57:57.058
cross every "T,"

57:57.725 --> 58:01.396
keep a record of every deed,
every whispered confession.

58:02.897 --> 58:06.401
The surveillance cameras.
So there's gotta be tapes.

58:08.236 --> 58:11.280
Our organization is
putting all its resources

58:11.281 --> 58:14.032
into Judge Mandrake's
confirmation to the federal bench

58:14.033 --> 58:16.578
as a precursor
to the Supreme Court.

58:17.203 --> 58:19.538
One would hate for
an awful secret to arise,

58:19.539 --> 58:22.249
which would derail
such an important agenda.

58:22.250 --> 58:24.586
That awful secret

58:25.086 --> 58:28.173
would be a valuable piece
of information indeed.

58:28.756 --> 58:31.593
Perhaps a bargaining chip
with the council,

58:32.469 --> 58:35.597
used possibly
to reacquire one's freedom?

58:37.432 --> 58:39.601
To get one's
life back again?

58:41.269 --> 58:43.771
Would you like
your life back, Luke?

58:56.201 --> 58:57.743
His birthday
was last week.

58:57.744 --> 58:59.661
I know.
It's a peace offering.

59:00.955 --> 59:02.080
Turn yours down, man!

59:02.081 --> 59:04.417
Hey, guys, turn off
those damn televisions!

59:04.667 --> 59:07.003
Hey, turn off
those televisions!

59:07.962 --> 59:09.463
We have a guest.

59:09.464 --> 59:11.132
Hey, boys.

59:11.424 --> 59:12.841
I need to talk to you.

59:12.842 --> 59:15.469
Sully, I'm really sorry I missed your
birthday last week and I just...

59:15.470 --> 59:17.095
You know what, hey,
if you want to confess,

59:17.096 --> 59:18.472
St. Something-Or-Other
is down the street.

59:18.473 --> 59:20.182
So why don't you just roll
yourself into there, huh.

59:20.183 --> 59:21.308
I'm not kidding
this time.

59:21.309 --> 59:23.060
I'm in real
trouble here, okay?

59:23.061 --> 59:24.603
If you don't help me,
Sully's birthday

59:24.604 --> 59:26.021
is not gonna be
the last one I miss,

59:26.022 --> 59:27.398
including my own,
you understand?

59:27.982 --> 59:29.317
Why should we help you?
Huh, Lukey?

59:29.776 --> 59:31.068
I don't know.

59:31.069 --> 59:33.695
Maybe you feel like
turning the other cheek.

59:33.696 --> 59:35.239
Or perhaps
you wanna be forgiving.

59:35.240 --> 59:36.782
Or maybe, just maybe
you wanna try

59:36.783 --> 59:39.117
and be a better friend to
me than I've been to you.

59:39.118 --> 59:40.662
Come over here
for a second.

59:41.371 --> 59:44.874
More than likely,
you wanna take a look out of this window,

59:45.166 --> 59:47.834
'cause you'll probably see
a '63 T-Bird convertible.

59:47.835 --> 59:50.003
Dual exhausts,
four-barrel carb

59:50.004 --> 59:52.840
and fully restored original
red leather interior.

59:53.550 --> 59:55.342
And it belongs to me.

59:55.343 --> 59:58.012
You help me out,
it belongs to you.

01:01:07.874 --> 01:01:09.041
You wanna know
what's up?

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:10.877
Big Boy changes the
digital tapes twice a day,

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:12.586
<i>10:00 a.m., 10:00 p.m.</i>

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:14.504
<i>I mean, you can
set your watch by it.</i>

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:15.840
<i>So now we know
his schedule.</i>

01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:28.143
<i>He's not going
out the front, J.J.</i>

01:01:28.144 --> 01:01:29.603
<i>He's going back
the way he came.</i>

01:01:29.604 --> 01:01:32.899
<i>J.J., he's going back
the way he came. Over.</i>

01:01:35.568 --> 01:01:37.612
Okay, got him.
He's heading east. I'm on it.

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:41.239
Are you having a problem,
Mr. McNamara?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.407
Um, yes, sir.

01:01:42.408 --> 01:01:43.660
Actually, it's a family emergency.
Excuse me.

01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:54.379
Don't lose him.
We gotta find out where he takes those tapes.

01:03:09.454 --> 01:03:11.497
Hey. Wait. Don't... Hey.
Hey. Wait.

01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:21.715
What do you think
you're doing?

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:23.717
Nobody's allowed into the Sturtevant
Collection without a pass.

01:03:23.718 --> 01:03:25.469
Come on, let's go.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.721
Come on.

01:04:16.187 --> 01:04:18.648
You know what this is?
It's a bug.

01:04:20.024 --> 01:04:22.067
It's a bug! Understand?

01:04:22.068 --> 01:04:23.193
Now, I want you
to listen to me.

01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:24.946
I want you to stop
following Lombard's people.

01:04:26.405 --> 01:04:27.489
You've been digging,
Luke,

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.992
and if you keep digging,
you're gonna dig your own grave.

01:04:30.993 --> 01:04:33.912
What, you didn't think they wouldn't
figure out what you've been doing?

01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:35.539
Hell, they know
everything we do!

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:36.916
They know
every place we go!

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:40.126
Your place is bugged!
My place is as well!

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:41.837
Oh, and your friend
upstairs?

01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:43.840
Her place is bugged too,
so she's not safe either.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.133
None of us are safe!

01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:58.145
I didn't mean
to hurt your friend, Luke.

01:05:06.237 --> 01:05:09.448
I swear to God,
I never meant to hurt your friend.

01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:21.794
Please. Please don't
give 'em a reason.

01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:24.839
Please.

01:05:25.381 --> 01:05:27.174
That's all they need.

01:05:40.187 --> 01:05:41.521
Chloe, I need
to talk to you.

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:42.856
I'm late for class.

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:44.190
Please!

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:45.442
So talk.

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:46.944
Chloe, please!

01:05:48.446 --> 01:05:49.906
I...
What?

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:57.078
I have a friend,
and he's made some decisions,

01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:59.874
but it turns out
that they were all wrong.

01:06:00.249 --> 01:06:02.334
Why? Why were
they wrong?

01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:05.922
Because he was selfish,
and because he was greedy,

01:06:07.465 --> 01:06:11.176
and he thought they would give him
everything that he ever wanted.

01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:14.221
But all they ended up
giving him was disaster.

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:17.849
So, now,
this friend of mine,

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:19.434
he can go out
on a limb,

01:06:19.435 --> 01:06:20.769
and that limb
could get cut off.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.898
But everything about being
on that limb is right.

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:27.109
So what do I do?

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.241
We should sit down,
and you should treat me like a friend

01:06:35.242 --> 01:06:37.119
and tell me the truth.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.207
Okay.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:45.460
I think it's time that
we remove Mr. McNamara.

01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:46.586
He's no longer loyal.

01:06:46.587 --> 01:06:49.882
You are asking this council to choose
your son's fate over Mr. McNamara's?

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:51.424
Our membership
will never allow

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:53.093
such a corrupt and
unfair motion to pass.

01:06:53.094 --> 01:06:55.470
The membership will have
to understand that we...

01:06:55.471 --> 01:06:56.889
They must never know.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:07:01.476
According to Rule 88,
if this council wishes to make a decision

01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:03.770
which will be kept secret
from our membership,

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:06.023
it will require
a unanimous vote.

01:07:06.607 --> 01:07:09.652
Then I move,
under Rule 88,

01:07:10.695 --> 01:07:12.195
that Mr. Lucas McNamara

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:15.241
undergo psychiatric evaluation
at our hospital,

01:07:16.826 --> 01:07:18.452
and I hereby call
for a vote.

01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:38.305
The motion is defeated.

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.228
Ames, can I see you
upstairs for a moment?

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:49.942
We used to believe
in the same things.

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:52.068
What happened?

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:54.155
I've learned
there are limits, Litten.

01:07:54.363 --> 01:07:55.573
Really?

01:08:17.011 --> 01:08:19.721
She likes to eat Popsicles
after you make love.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.390
I've had
my own peccadilloes,

01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:27.354
but, my God, Ames,
she's only 19.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:31.817
And I'm not sure your wife
or the voters of Virginia

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:35.779
would be as forgiving
as I am.

01:08:37.073 --> 01:08:38.823
Oh, well.

01:08:42.036 --> 01:08:43.828
Shall we vote again?

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:55.006
McNamara!

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:57.716
What, this is how
you break up with me?

01:08:57.718 --> 01:08:59.011
With this
pathetic letter?

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.720
What... Oh, let me see.
"Oh, but, can we still be friends?"

01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:03.389
Hey, I wrote the letter.
I don't need it read back to me.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:04.515
Yeah, I know
you wrote the letter!

01:09:04.517 --> 01:09:07.227
And no, we can't be friends.
You just remember three things, pal.

01:09:07.228 --> 01:09:11.397
You don't talk to me,
you don't call me, and don't ever

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:14.984
send me one of these
chickenshit letters ever again!

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.238
Piece of shit!

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.078
Go, girl.

01:09:28.124 --> 01:09:29.792
Smart play, Lucas.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:31.961
Smart play.

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:54.775
<i>If I could have</i>

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:57.194
<i>Just a moment of you</i>

01:09:59.113 --> 01:10:01.364
Okay, they can't hear us now.
Did they buy it?

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:04.160
I'm pretty sure.
You were very convincing.

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:05.535
Did you get everything
I need?

01:10:05.536 --> 01:10:06.619
Yeah, it's in there.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.580
I don't understand something.
If they're so smart,

01:10:08.581 --> 01:10:10.707
the first thing they'd do is
destroy those surveillance tapes.

01:10:10.708 --> 01:10:12.709
You don't know these people, okay.
This is how they work.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.502
They use each other's
nasty little secrets

01:10:14.503 --> 01:10:15.796
against themselves.

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.090
Wait. Well, if you
changed your mind,

01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:22.303
if you decided to run, I could help you.
My family...

01:10:24.013 --> 01:10:26.307
My... My family
could help you.

01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:29.852
I can't live like that.

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:35.398
I need you to promise me something,
Chloe.

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:36.774
What?

01:10:36.775 --> 01:10:38.818
No matter what happens from here on,
you don't get involved.

01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:40.445
No, I can't do that.
Please, just...

01:10:40.446 --> 01:10:42.823
No, you got me involved.
I'm involved.

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.490
I can't move forward if I
think you're in danger.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:45.992
I'm gonna be
there for you, okay.

01:10:45.993 --> 01:10:47.619
Do you understand what these
people are capable of?

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.703
I do understand, okay.

01:10:48.704 --> 01:10:50.497
These people will kill you.
I'm in love with you.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.002
I am.

01:10:58.005 --> 01:10:59.464
I love you.

01:10:59.465 --> 01:11:01.842
<i>Would you leave your door</i>

01:11:02.051 --> 01:11:03.509
<i>Ajar</i>

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:05.428
<i>If I could have</i>

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:07.431
<i>Just a part of you</i>

01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:13.354
<i>Let me drink of your tides</i>

01:11:13.646 --> 01:11:17.483
<i>Oh, baby, the rain runs over
and you're scared</i>

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.236
<i>With no consequence</i>

01:11:22.488 --> 01:11:26.992
<i>To be the liquid in a glass that
falls around your lips and mouth</i>

01:11:51.267 --> 01:11:52.393
Ow!

01:13:25.903 --> 01:13:28.071
Okay. You got me.
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

01:13:28.072 --> 01:13:29.155
Shut up!

01:13:29.156 --> 01:13:30.990
Hey, there's no need
for the gun. Come on.

01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:33.326
Give me the tape.
I got your tape. It's right here.

01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:35.495
It's right here. Just come and get it, man.
Come and get it.

01:13:35.496 --> 01:13:36.789
Bring it to me.

01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:38.540
Come on, man.
It's right here.

01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:51.386
Come on! Come on!

01:13:51.387 --> 01:13:52.846
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

01:13:56.725 --> 01:13:57.851
Come on! Let's go!

01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.195
Let's go! Go!
Go, go, go!

01:14:23.085 --> 01:14:24.711
Nice plan, Lukey.

01:14:36.849 --> 01:14:38.475
Okay, here we go.

01:14:40.269 --> 01:14:41.352
There he is.

01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:43.729
<i>You stole my key,
you stole my book.</i>

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.523
<i>I want your camera,
I want the tape,</i>

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:47.066
<i>and I want
my stuff back now.</i>

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:49.152
<i>Here's your key.
We'll get the book later.</i>

01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:51.905
<i>No, you give me the key,
we'll go get the book.</i>

01:14:52.072 --> 01:14:53.448
<i>You won't say anything
to anybody.</i>

01:14:53.449 --> 01:14:56.076
<i>I won't say anything to anybody,
and nothing'll happen.</i>

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:09.505
Get off me!

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.009
<i>No!</i>
Oh, my God.

01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:17.597
<i>Oh, God! No!</i>

01:15:17.598 --> 01:15:19.265
<i>No! Oh, God!</i>

01:15:19.266 --> 01:15:20.601
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:15:26.106 --> 01:15:28.275
<i>Dad! Dad! You have
to listen to me!</i>

01:15:28.942 --> 01:15:31.527
<i>No, you have to listen to me now!
Something happened!</i>

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:34.490
<i>Dad, I just killed a guy
in the ritual room.</i>

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:37.116
<i>Dad, I should
call the police!</i>

01:15:37.117 --> 01:15:39.119
<i>No, I have
to call 911!</i>

01:15:40.329 --> 01:15:42.456
<i>I can't just
leave him here!</i>

01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:44.625
<i>Yes, I understand!</i>

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:48.420
<i>I understand! All right?
All right, I'm leaving!</i>

01:16:00.933 --> 01:16:03.309
Luke. Oh, my God.
Wait. He's moving.

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:04.810
He's moving...
Look, he's moving.

01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:06.063
Jesus, he's still alive.

01:16:07.064 --> 01:16:08.315
Yeah. Totally.

01:16:08.482 --> 01:16:10.609
Did you see his arm? Yeah.
Fast forward the tape.

01:16:16.865 --> 01:16:19.034
Wait.
Hold on, hold on.

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:22.496
Can you go close up
on the lower right hand?

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:24.790
<i>Help me.</i>

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:29.002
Luke, who are they?
Who are they?

01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:33.674
That's Martin Lombard,
the university provost.

01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:39.011
<i>He's pretty
far gone, sir.</i>

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:40.097
Who is he talking to?

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:42.014
It could only
be Mandrake.

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:43.307
<i>Will do. Done.</i>

01:16:43.308 --> 01:16:45.017
Can you get
any closer on this?

01:16:45.018 --> 01:16:46.185
Yeah.

01:16:46.186 --> 01:16:48.689
Lombard works
for Mandrake.

01:16:49.356 --> 01:16:50.649
Closer.

01:16:52.526 --> 01:16:53.777
Closer.

01:17:12.337 --> 01:17:13.714
Oh, my God.

01:17:16.383 --> 01:17:17.801
They killed him.

01:17:20.554 --> 01:17:22.723
They killed him.

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:47.623
What are you gonna do?

01:18:10.145 --> 01:18:12.731
Luke, we were just
talking about you.

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:19.654
What are you
doing here, Caleb?

01:18:19.655 --> 01:18:22.281
I'm sorry, Luke,
but I couldn't live with myself.

01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:23.908
I had to tell them
what you did.

01:18:23.909 --> 01:18:25.117
What I did?

01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:26.369
Everything you told me.

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:28.663
How you and Will had a fight,
the accident

01:18:28.664 --> 01:18:30.540
and how you covered it up to
make it look like a suicide.

01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:32.833
He's lying to you,
Detective.

01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:34.920
I'm not lying.
I have nothing to lie about.

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:39.173
I have evidence, okay?

01:18:39.174 --> 01:18:42.010
Everything you wanted to know, the truth.
It's on the tape.

01:18:44.429 --> 01:18:48.266
Mr. Mandrake, we have your statement.
We'll talk to you later.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.946
Keep Mr. McNamara
company.

01:19:01.947 --> 01:19:03.280
Get something
to play this tape on,

01:19:03.281 --> 01:19:04.990
and call
the D.A.'s office.

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:06.493
I want somebody
down here now.

01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:18.714
I haven't seen so much snow
since my last ski trip.

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:21.507
I'm telling you, this is the tape.
It's on here.

01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:24.094
It's a split-screen thing.
There's four different cameras running.

01:19:24.386 --> 01:19:26.263
It's gotta be forward.

01:19:32.853 --> 01:19:34.521
I don't... It was...

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:35.897
What?

01:19:39.693 --> 01:19:41.027
Oh, great.

01:19:51.163 --> 01:19:54.039
You... You switched
the goddamn tape!

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.625
Come on, McNamara.
Tell us what you imagined was on that tape.

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.002
Why'd you do it,
Sparrow? Huh?

01:19:58.003 --> 01:19:59.795
What do they have on you?
Why are you working for them?

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:01.298
"Them"?
The Skulls!

01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:02.549
Who?
The Skulls!

01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:05.719
The Skulls, man! Who do you think
is pulling the strings around here?

01:20:06.178 --> 01:20:09.138
They're watching you. They're watching me.
They control everything!

01:20:09.139 --> 01:20:12.391
They control everything we do, including him!
Even him!

01:20:12.392 --> 01:20:14.352
I've heard about enough.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:17.689
All right. Whoa. Hey.
You guys stay back. Keep them back.

01:20:18.023 --> 01:20:19.733
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You've gotta listen. Listen!

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.276
Martin Lombard
killed my roommate.

01:20:22.277 --> 01:20:24.153
Martin Lombard,
the university's provost?

01:20:24.154 --> 01:20:25.946
That's what was on the tape!
Is that what you're telling me?

01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:28.073
Yes, he snapped Will Beckford's neck,
for Christ's sakes, okay!

01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:30.075
He snapped Will Beckford's neck!
Oh, I see.

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:31.619
The suicide thing
was just a cover-up.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.745
Martin Lombard?
Yes.

01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:34.747
The suicide thing was a cover-up,
and he's in on it!

01:20:34.748 --> 01:20:37.625
Why did Martin Lombard
kill your roommate?

01:20:37.626 --> 01:20:39.710
Because Litten Mandrake
told him to.

01:20:39.711 --> 01:20:41.754
Oh. Judge Litten Mandrake?

01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:44.048
Yes. Judge Litten Mandrake.
He runs the whole show.

01:20:44.049 --> 01:20:45.090
That's ridiculous.

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.592
It's the truth!
You're working for him!

01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:48.135
It's ridiculous!
You're working for him!

01:20:48.136 --> 01:20:50.429
Listen, please.
You gotta believe me.

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.723
Listen,
he's in on it, okay?

01:20:52.724 --> 01:20:54.935
I'm innocent here.
I'm telling you the truth! Hey!

01:20:56.102 --> 01:20:57.521
I'm telling you the truth.

01:20:57.938 --> 01:20:59.898
I'm telling you the...

01:21:02.067 --> 01:21:03.943
You son of a bitch!
How could you do this to me?

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:05.194
No!

01:21:05.195 --> 01:21:06.780
Get off me!

01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:12.034
What do they got on you, Sparrow?
Huh? Huh?

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:14.830
Get him out of here!

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:17.790
What do they got on you, Sparrow, huh?
How'd they get to you?

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:20.377
Listen to me! I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

01:22:23.607 --> 01:22:24.982
What are you
doing here?

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.484
I saw the tape, Caleb.

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:29.486
What tape?
What are you talking about?

01:22:29.487 --> 01:22:30.863
Caleb, come on.

01:22:30.864 --> 01:22:34.283
Luke is in a mental hospital.
They may never let him out.

01:22:34.284 --> 01:22:36.494
Please, help me.

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:39.706
Just tell the police
the truth.

01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:41.708
Please.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.297
I think you better go.

01:22:57.223 --> 01:23:00.435
Hey, Caleb, before I go,
one last thing.

01:23:02.729 --> 01:23:07.024
The most interesting thing on that
tape was when you left the building.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:09.277
Will Beckford,
he wasn't dead.

01:23:37.847 --> 01:23:39.474
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.067
Help!

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:52.445
Hey! What happened?

01:24:19.973 --> 01:24:21.641
Miss Whitfield?

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:26.437
Miss Whitfield?
We need to speak to you.

01:24:27.856 --> 01:24:29.149
Miss Whit...

01:24:37.282 --> 01:24:38.742
Where is she?

01:24:58.011 --> 01:24:59.345
Get in, Chloe.
I'll take you to Luke.

01:24:59.554 --> 01:25:01.806
I will.
I'll take you to Luke.

01:25:02.348 --> 01:25:03.850
Come on. Let's go.

01:25:26.122 --> 01:25:28.041
There he is, Senator,
in the solarium.

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:31.920
Luke. Luke!

01:25:35.507 --> 01:25:37.884
Luke. Luke.

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:40.553
Luke, it's me.
It's me.

01:25:42.097 --> 01:25:43.515
Help me now!

01:25:44.808 --> 01:25:47.476
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:25:47.477 --> 01:25:48.936
I'm gonna get you...
It's gonna be okay.

01:25:48.937 --> 01:25:51.564
I'm gonna take care
of you, okay?

01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:54.567
It's gonna be okay.

01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:56.277
It's gonna be okay.

01:26:05.954 --> 01:26:07.663
I've arranged
this car for you.

01:26:07.664 --> 01:26:10.500
Wait. Wait. Where do we go?
What do we do?

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:17.006
Now, you must remind him that there
is only one solution to all this.

01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:20.300
"We live by the rules.
We die by the rules."

01:26:20.301 --> 01:26:21.844
I... Please, I don't
know what you mean.

01:26:21.845 --> 01:26:23.012
He'll know.

01:26:24.848 --> 01:26:26.057
Now go.

01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:32.938
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:34.858
I'm leaving the hospital.
They're all yours.

01:26:40.864 --> 01:26:43.116
You're gonna
be okay, okay?

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.951
This fits you.

01:26:45.952 --> 01:26:48.288
You're gonna be okay, 'cause you're
out of there. You're not going back.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.665
Everything's gonna
be okay, you hear me?

01:26:57.714 --> 01:27:00.049
Oh! Luke. Luke.

01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:02.968
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:27:02.969 --> 01:27:04.971
Oh, Luke.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.690
Son of a bitch!

01:27:22.864 --> 01:27:24.657
Whoo!

01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:29.787
Shit! Shit!

01:27:37.462 --> 01:27:38.838
Hang on.
Luke, hang on.

01:27:54.604 --> 01:27:56.272
Oh, no!

01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:15.583
Oh, God!
Shit, no! Shit!

01:28:26.177 --> 01:28:28.304
Come on.

01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:33.935
Get off of him!

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.271
Oh!

01:28:43.569 --> 01:28:45.613
No. No.

01:29:11.806 --> 01:29:13.724
I've been following you
since the hospital.

01:29:13.725 --> 01:29:15.184
That's what
the senator wanted.

01:29:16.311 --> 01:29:17.520
I don't understand.

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:19.604
The senator
has great faith

01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:20.898
that if you think it through,
you'll figure it out.

01:29:21.441 --> 01:29:23.776
The Sen... You work
for Senator Levritt?

01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:29.949
Just get in the jeep
and get out of here.

01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:32.952
Did you see
what was on that tape?

01:29:33.745 --> 01:29:36.789
Don't ask me questions.
I've given you answers.

01:29:37.498 --> 01:29:38.708
Now go.

01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:10.823
Thanks.

01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:14.743
We've got to figure out
what to do next,

01:30:14.744 --> 01:30:16.954
because they're
gonna find us.

01:30:17.121 --> 01:30:18.206
Okay.

01:30:19.248 --> 01:30:20.874
Sparrow was working
for Levritt...

01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:22.042
Yeah.

01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:24.169
But he was the one
that switched the tape,

01:30:24.170 --> 01:30:26.088
and he didn't help me
when I needed it.

01:30:26.089 --> 01:30:28.507
He waited until
I got out of Sanctuary.

01:30:28.508 --> 01:30:30.175
All of which
means what?

01:30:32.678 --> 01:30:34.764
What is Levritt
trying to tell us?

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:37.392
"We live by the rules.
We die by the rules"?

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.186
What?

01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:41.687
Levritt.

01:30:42.355 --> 01:30:45.858
He told me to remind you that we live
by the rules, we die by the rules.

01:30:52.156 --> 01:30:53.199
Yes.

01:30:56.494 --> 01:30:59.330
Rule 119, right in
the middle of the page.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.084
"A challenge
may be presented

01:31:04.085 --> 01:31:06.294
"and gentlemanly
means pursued"?

01:31:06.295 --> 01:31:07.963
"Gentlemanly means."
I don't get it.

01:31:07.964 --> 01:31:09.090
I do.

01:31:11.175 --> 01:31:14.929
Levritt wanted to make sure that I
had only one option available to me.

01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:17.557
Gentlemanly means.

01:31:19.517 --> 01:31:21.059
What day is it today?

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.062
Uh, it's Friday.

01:31:25.815 --> 01:31:28.567
The Skulls are gonna be out
on the island tomorrow.

01:31:28.568 --> 01:31:30.528
Baby, come on.
Lay down.

01:31:31.779 --> 01:31:32.905
Come on.

01:31:33.364 --> 01:31:35.116
Come on.

01:31:40.872 --> 01:31:43.624
So tomorrow I bring war
to the Skulls.

01:31:55.011 --> 01:31:57.804
We are gathered,
as we have done for over 200 years,

01:31:57.805 --> 01:32:00.892
to celebrate the end
of the Revealing Process.

01:32:02.602 --> 01:32:04.895
And now that you have
shared all with each other,

01:32:04.896 --> 01:32:07.105
we would like
to show you

01:32:07.106 --> 01:32:09.025
exactly how much
you are appreciated.

01:32:14.238 --> 01:32:17.867
A toast, to the successful
progression of Skulls.

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:20.119
Above any other.

01:32:20.578 --> 01:32:21.871
Above any other.

01:32:23.748 --> 01:32:25.123
Hear! Hear!

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:28.585
No. No. Please,
Mr. McNamara, please.

01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:30.629
You know you're not
supposed to be here,

01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:31.963
especially the way
you're dressed.

01:32:31.964 --> 01:32:35.510
Oh, Mr. McNamara.
Come to collect your check.

01:32:36.636 --> 01:32:39.137
Under the auspices
of Rule 119,

01:32:39.138 --> 01:32:41.139
I hereby petition
for justice

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.516
for the satisfaction
of differences

01:32:42.517 --> 01:32:45.144
between myself
and Mr. Caleb Mandrake

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:47.521
in the matter of the
death of Will Beckford.

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:50.190
What's Rule 119?

01:32:50.191 --> 01:32:55.529
119, "Of disputes arising between
members of such serious nature

01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:57.989
"that avail themselves
of no other solution..."

01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:00.201
"A challenge may
be presented

01:33:00.451 --> 01:33:02.036
"and gentlemanly
means pursued."

01:33:03.496 --> 01:33:04.664
And what does
that mean?

01:33:05.039 --> 01:33:06.915
He's challenging you
to a duel, Caleb.

01:33:08.668 --> 01:33:11.796
A duel?
You must be kidding.

01:33:12.171 --> 01:33:13.798
No, sir. I'm not.

01:33:14.882 --> 01:33:16.383
Dr. Whitney?

01:33:16.384 --> 01:33:18.594
It is part
of our tradition.

01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:21.347
The man's a fugitive.
He should be arrested.

01:33:22.306 --> 01:33:23.848
Call the authorities.
Fitcairn.

01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:26.352
Our rules supersede
theirs, Litten.

01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:29.021
You of all people
know that.

01:33:31.107 --> 01:33:32.357
Then I demand the right

01:33:32.358 --> 01:33:34.569
to take the place
of my son in this duel.

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:36.779
You can't, Chairman.

01:33:37.697 --> 01:33:39.698
"To avoid conflicts
of interest,

01:33:39.699 --> 01:33:41.449
"all council members
are excluded

01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:44.662
"from proceedings pertaining
to their kin's fate."

01:33:44.912 --> 01:33:48.040
It's Rule 119-B,
line 15.

01:35:03.366 --> 01:35:05.993
There are two ways
out of this, Lucas.

01:35:06.619 --> 01:35:09.288
One is you can withdraw
your challenge.

01:35:09.789 --> 01:35:11.290
And the other?

01:35:12.249 --> 01:35:16.420
You're dead. Caleb's a crack shot.
You've got no chance.

01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:21.050
I guess I won't be coming
over for Thanksgiving, then.

01:35:37.358 --> 01:35:39.985
Dad, I have to ask you
this one thing.

01:35:42.613 --> 01:35:45.533
Was Will Beckford still alive
when I left the ritual room?

01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:47.743
Son, I love you,

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.287
and I've never lied
to you.

01:35:51.706 --> 01:35:53.082
The answer is no.

01:36:10.725 --> 01:36:13.686
Gentlemen,
it's time to begin.

01:36:28.534 --> 01:36:30.368
Mr. Mandrake,
you have been challenged,

01:36:30.369 --> 01:36:33.080
therefore the choice
of weapons is yours.

01:36:48.888 --> 01:36:51.182
Gentlemen,
take your positions.

01:37:01.484 --> 01:37:02.943
Back to back.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.579
Tell them the truth about
what happened to Will.

01:37:15.581 --> 01:37:16.706
I'm sorry, Luke.

01:37:16.707 --> 01:37:19.460
Don't apologize to me, Caleb.
Just tell them the truth.

01:37:20.795 --> 01:37:22.922
No, I'm sorry for what
I have to do to you.

01:37:23.297 --> 01:37:26.133
Cock your pistols.
Prepare to fire.

01:37:40.481 --> 01:37:42.942
Ten paces.
On my signal.

01:37:49.949 --> 01:37:52.326
One, two...

01:37:53.452 --> 01:37:55.370
Caleb, what you did to Will
Beckford was an accident.

01:37:55.371 --> 01:37:56.579
Three, four...

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.706
This will be
murder, Caleb!

01:37:58.707 --> 01:38:00.251
Are you ready to murder your friend?
Five, six...

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.586
Your soul mate?
Seven...

01:38:03.087 --> 01:38:05.130
Just tell them the truth and
this ends right now. Eight...

01:38:05.631 --> 01:38:07.967
Nine, ten.

01:38:09.176 --> 01:38:11.094
Tell them the truth!

01:38:11.095 --> 01:38:12.929
Just tell them
the truth, please.

01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:14.348
Fire, Caleb!

01:38:14.974 --> 01:38:16.016
Dad!

01:38:18.394 --> 01:38:19.895
Fire, damn it!

01:38:20.312 --> 01:38:21.563
Caleb,
just tell them the truth,

01:38:21.564 --> 01:38:23.314
and we'll get
through this together.

01:38:23.315 --> 01:38:24.608
I swear.

01:38:38.706 --> 01:38:40.164
Get my bag!
Get my bag!

01:38:43.127 --> 01:38:45.254
Caleb!
Is there a doctor here?

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:49.507
Stay back!
Stay back!

01:38:49.508 --> 01:38:51.509
Caleb!

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:53.177
Just relax,
Mr. Mandrake.

01:38:53.178 --> 01:38:55.306
Gauze!
We need gauze!

01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:01.020
You weren't
worth the effort.

01:39:04.356 --> 01:39:05.441
Litten.

01:39:05.608 --> 01:39:07.693
Where is my bag?

01:39:09.778 --> 01:39:10.987
Move back!

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.566
It's over, Caleb.

01:39:48.817 --> 01:39:49.902
It's over.

01:40:09.838 --> 01:40:13.092
You told me that there are
always wars to be fought.

01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:15.218
This was your war.

01:40:15.219 --> 01:40:16.844
Yes.

01:40:16.845 --> 01:40:18.137
And the good guys won.

01:40:18.138 --> 01:40:20.098
Nobody won.

01:40:20.099 --> 01:40:22.434
Not true.
Mandrake's finished.

01:40:22.726 --> 01:40:25.395
He'll never be confirmed
to the federal court.

01:40:25.396 --> 01:40:28.147
I'll become Skull chairman.
You'll be exonerated

01:40:28.148 --> 01:40:32.110
and help me lead the new generation
of Skulls into the future.

01:40:32.111 --> 01:40:33.444
You know,
someone I loved once told me

01:40:33.445 --> 01:40:36.281
that if it's secret and elite,
it can't be good.

01:40:37.866 --> 01:40:39.326
He was right.

01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:42.371
You used me.
No, Luke.

01:40:43.038 --> 01:40:44.622
I helped you.

01:40:44.623 --> 01:40:47.793
Taught you how to make the
world work for you, for us.

01:40:49.253 --> 01:40:51.462
Do you truly believe you
can walk away from this?

01:40:51.463 --> 01:40:52.839
All we've given you?

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.299
And someday,
when I call on you for a favor,

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.343
will you be able
to deny me?

01:40:57.344 --> 01:41:00.471
And if you deny me,
will it jeopardize the life you've built

01:41:00.472 --> 01:41:01.974
for your wife
and your family?

01:41:04.643 --> 01:41:06.937
I don't know if you can live
with those doubts, Lucas.

01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:10.482
Watch me.

01:41:17.156 --> 01:41:18.657
Well done, son.

01:41:20.325 --> 01:41:21.410
Well done.

01:42:40.531 --> 01:42:44.409
<i>If I could have
just a moment of you</i>

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:49.747
<i>Would I be wanting</i>

01:42:49.748 --> 01:42:51.124
<i>More</i>

01:42:51.125 --> 01:42:55.337
<i>If I could have
just a taste of you</i>

01:42:57.172 --> 01:42:59.424
<i>Would I be</i>

01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:01.634
<i>Addicted</i>

01:43:01.635 --> 01:43:05.347
<i>If I could have
just a touch of you</i>

01:43:07.766 --> 01:43:10.561
<i>But I tear myself</i>

01:43:10.727 --> 01:43:11.936
<i>Away</i>

01:43:11.937 --> 01:43:15.858
<i>I would pray to be the rain
that runs over and in your skin</i>

01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:18.443
<i>With no consequence</i>

01:43:20.612 --> 01:43:25.283
<i>To be the liquid in your glass that
falls around your lips and mouth</i>

01:43:25.284 --> 01:43:27.452
<i>Swallow me</i>

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.959
<i>If I could have
just a breath of you</i>

01:43:36.253 --> 01:43:38.338
<i>Would you, could you</i>

01:43:39.089 --> 01:43:40.631
<i>Infect me</i>

01:43:40.632 --> 01:43:44.136
<i>If I could have
just a view of you</i>

01:43:46.597 --> 01:43:48.807
<i>Would you leave your door</i>

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.058
<i>Ajar</i>

01:43:51.059 --> 01:43:55.105
<i>If I could have
just a part of you</i>

01:43:56.815 --> 01:44:00.109
<i>Let me drink of your</i>

01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:01.402
<i>Tides</i>

01:44:01.403 --> 01:44:04.865
<i>I would pray to be the rain
that runs over and in your skin</i>

01:44:05.657 --> 01:44:08.327
<i>With no consequence</i>

01:44:09.995 --> 01:44:14.583
<i>To be the liquid in your glass that
falls around your lips and mouth</i>

01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:16.793
<i>Swallow me</i>

01:44:19.504 --> 01:44:22.173
<i>And after would
the silence thicken, stiffen?</i>

01:44:22.174 --> 01:44:25.176
<i>Would I run home in the dark
with something stolen?</i>

01:44:25.177 --> 01:44:28.262
<i>Would you be slinking
in my conscience, laughing?</i>

01:44:28.263 --> 01:44:31.141
<i>Would this hunger
ever cease?</i>

01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:35.187
<i>You are the cliff
that I walk</i>

01:44:37.356 --> 01:44:40.442
<i>Lord help me if I fall</i>

01:44:43.403 --> 01:44:47.366
<i>Are you more
than my hunger?</i>

01:44:49.409 --> 01:44:52.246
<i>Lord help me if I starve</i>

01:44:55.457 --> 01:45:00.754
<i>If I could have
just a moment of you</i>

01:45:01.505 --> 01:45:04.423

01:45:22.442 --> 01:45:25.486

01:46:29.885 --> 01:46:31.178
<i>Addicted</i>
