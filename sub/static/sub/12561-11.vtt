WEBVTT

00:01.206 --> 00:03.073
- You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:03.074 --> 00:04.742
To save some kid off the street.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.677
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:06.678 --> 00:08.045
- This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:08.045 --> 00:10.147
- What trip?
- To t hamptons.

00:10.148 --> 00:12.116
- I'm raising money
for a local free clinic.

00:12.117 --> 00:13.851
- You want hankmed
to run your clinic?

00:13.852 --> 00:15.152
- I want to work this out.

00:15.153 --> 00:17.221
I want the clinic
at hamptons heritage

00:17.222 --> 00:18.789
So that we can help more people.

00:18.790 --> 00:20.124
- I went to dad's house
the other day

00:20.125 --> 00:22.126
And I found shadow pond
letterhead.

00:22.127 --> 00:23.460
- So?

00:23.461 --> 00:24.595
- What if he threw your
birthday party

00:24.596 --> 00:25.629
To steal the letterhead?

00:25.630 --> 00:27.464
Boris operates at a level...

00:27.465 --> 00:29.433
Let's just say it's beyond
your reach.

00:29.434 --> 00:30.634
- Eddie r. Lawson.

00:30.635 --> 00:32.703
- I know exactly who you are.

00:32.704 --> 00:33.971
- What do you make of Emily?

00:33.972 --> 00:34.972
- I'm still feeling her out.

00:34.973 --> 00:36.407
- Dr. Emily peck faxed over

00:36.408 --> 00:37.608
A request for Jake's records.

00:37.609 --> 00:38.842
- What?

00:38.843 --> 00:41.679
- This is war.
She's coming after us.

00:51.923 --> 00:54.291
- Henry, get up!

00:54.292 --> 00:56.126
E.S.M. Right now.

00:56.127 --> 00:59.463
Emily peck's crossed
a serious line.

00:59.464 --> 01:01.565
- Hello.

01:01.566 --> 01:03.734
You've reached the voicemail
of divya katdare.

01:03.735 --> 01:05.135
Please leave a message.

01:05.135 --> 01:06.470
- All right, so you know
how I check

01:06.471 --> 01:08.072
The hankmed Web site traffic
every Monday morning?

01:08.073 --> 01:10.741
So I type "hankmed. Com"
into my browser and...

01:12.110 --> 01:13.510
- Press "one" to continue.
- Kidding me.

01:13.511 --> 01:14.912
- Press "two" to re...

01:14.913 --> 01:17.614
- So I typed "yankmed. Com"
by accident, all right?

01:17.615 --> 01:19.917
I get redirected
to none other than

01:19.918 --> 01:22.119
Dremilypeck.Com.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.754
Yeah, same exact thing happens

01:23.755 --> 01:25.756
When I type in
"hankme," "hankmess,"

01:25.757 --> 01:26.757
"hunkmed."

01:26.758 --> 01:28.125
She purchased Web addresses

01:28.126 --> 01:29.760
To play on our name,

01:29.761 --> 01:31.462
So we got to come up
with a serious

01:31.463 --> 01:34.031
Cyber-retaliation pl
to deal with this succubus.

01:34.032 --> 01:35.099
This...

01:35.100 --> 01:36.834
Press "one" to con...

01:36.835 --> 01:38.068
- "succubus"?

01:38.069 --> 01:41.338
Really?

01:45.877 --> 01:47.811
- Yes, it's a...

01:47.812 --> 01:50.581
Highly attractive seductress
or enchantress.

01:50.582 --> 01:52.916
- Female demon who ruins men.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.919
- Oh, okay.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.121
- Awkward, isn't it?

01:57.122 --> 01:59.223
define "awkward."

01:59.224 --> 02:01.759
- What you're feeling right now.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.495
- Hank, she's redirecting
our clients

02:04.496 --> 02:05.929
And potential clients
to her Web site.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.365
- What?
Is that true?

02:08.366 --> 02:10.366
- It is true that
I hired a Web designer

02:10.368 --> 02:13.103
To create and host
my new Web site,

02:13.104 --> 02:15.939
But nothing he's doing
is illegal.

02:15.940 --> 02:17.574
I wouldn't allow that.
- She wouldn't allow that.

02:17.575 --> 02:20.644
- Wait, what... what is she doing
in our house uninvited?

02:20.645 --> 02:22.012
- Um.

02:22.013 --> 02:23.580
- Why aren't you
asking her that?

02:23.581 --> 02:25.315
What the hell is going
on right now?

02:25.316 --> 02:26.817
This... and do not tell me
we'll talk...

02:26.818 --> 02:28.152
- We'll talk about this later.

02:28.153 --> 02:31.422
- Are you sleeping
with the enemy?

02:31.423 --> 02:35.793
- It's pronounced "emily."

02:35.794 --> 02:38.629
- See you later, Hank.
- Okay.

02:38.630 --> 02:41.899
House call.
We'll talk later.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.168
Oh, uh, what's
an "e. S.M." anyway?

02:44.169 --> 02:46.103
- It's an emergency
staff meeting.

02:46.104 --> 02:49.139
- Tell divya it's cancelled.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.816
- Miss lam, I think my search

02:58.817 --> 03:00.884
For the perfect replacement
is over.

03:00.885 --> 03:04.621
You are without a doubt
the most qualified applicant

03:04.622 --> 03:05.823
For this job.

03:05.824 --> 03:07.458
- Miss katdare,
I feel so honored.

03:07.459 --> 03:09.093
- Please, call me divya.

03:09.094 --> 03:11.028
Of course, you'll still have
to interview

03:11.029 --> 03:12.830
With Dr. Lawson
and his brother Evan.

03:12.831 --> 03:14.264
- Absolutely.

03:14.265 --> 03:15.933
I understand they
are as professional

03:15.934 --> 03:17.568
And discreet as you are.

03:17.569 --> 03:18.969
- Oh, indeed they are.

03:18.970 --> 03:21.738
I assure you, miss lam,
hankmed is about medicine,

03:21.739 --> 03:23.373
Not gossip.

03:23.374 --> 03:24.975
- Divya!
There you are.

03:24.976 --> 03:26.176
- Evan.

03:26.177 --> 03:29.346
Uh, wow.
We were just talking about you.

03:29.347 --> 03:30.514
I would like to introduce you...

03:30.515 --> 03:32.583
- Some other time.
I'm sorry.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.885
I'm sure you're a lovely friend
or wedding planner,

03:34.886 --> 03:36.019
Cake Baker, whatever you are.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.354
This is just
an emergency, okay?

03:37.355 --> 03:39.356
Dr. Peck?
She's shafting us.

03:39.357 --> 03:41.492
And, yes, it is
in the way you think.

03:41.493 --> 03:42.793
- Okay, you know what?

03:42.794 --> 03:43.827
Evan, I think that this
should wait.

03:43.828 --> 03:45.162
- No, it can't wait,

03:45.163 --> 03:46.530
'cause not only
is she bonking the boss,

03:46.531 --> 03:47.598
The succubus is also trying
to steal our clients.

03:47.599 --> 03:48.866
Is that a cruller?

03:48.867 --> 03:50.434
- Um, should I go?
- No.

03:50.435 --> 03:51.568
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Miss lam, wait.

03:51.569 --> 03:53.036
- Divya, can you focus?
We need a plan.

03:53.037 --> 03:54.471
- What we need
to do is to continue

03:54.472 --> 03:55.939
To stay out of Hank's
personal life.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.407
Good-bye, Alice!

03:57.408 --> 04:01.145
We'll be in touch!

04:01.146 --> 04:04.047
- You already knew about Emily
and Hank, divya?

04:04.048 --> 04:05.949
Divya? Divya?

04:05.950 --> 04:07.117
Why did you not tell me?

04:07.118 --> 04:08.385
- For the same reason
that I am not

04:08.386 --> 04:09.820
Going to talk about it now.

04:09.821 --> 04:11.021
It is not my business.

04:11.022 --> 04:13.457
What is my business

04:13.458 --> 04:15.993
Is finding a replacement
for me before I leave,

04:15.994 --> 04:19.428
Which I think you have
completely screwed up!

04:19.430 --> 04:22.599
- Ugh.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.967
- Chopper's going down.
Chopper's going down.

04:23.968 --> 04:25.335
Man, move forward.
Push forward, man.

04:25.336 --> 04:26.336
Push forward.

04:26.337 --> 04:27.871
Flank on the left.

04:27.872 --> 04:29.840
- Wait, you said his mother
made the appointment?

04:29.841 --> 04:31.008
- Yeah, she called me.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.109
Watch your head.

04:32.110 --> 04:33.143
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

04:33.144 --> 04:34.411
Watch for the sniper.

04:34.412 --> 04:35.913
What? What? What?

04:35.914 --> 04:38.415
No, Daniel, tell your mother
you'll do your homework later.

04:38.416 --> 04:41.285
So algebra's easy.
This is war.

04:41.286 --> 04:43.387
- Uh, Stanley?

04:43.388 --> 04:48.425
- Men, retreat!
Retreat!

04:48.426 --> 04:49.927
Aww.
Over.

04:49.928 --> 04:52.196
It's over.

04:52.197 --> 04:53.864
Are you Jill Casey
and Hank Lawson

04:53.865 --> 04:54.998
From the hamptons
family clinic?

04:54.999 --> 04:56.900
- Yes, we are.

04:56.901 --> 04:58.368
It's nice to meet you, Stanley.

04:58.369 --> 04:59.369
We hear that you're
not feeling well.

04:59.370 --> 05:01.104
- Roger that.
Big time.

05:01.105 --> 05:02.539
- We're sorry to hear that.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.208
We can see that your troops
really need you.

05:04.209 --> 05:06.710
- Four months ago,
I caught a cold.

05:06.711 --> 05:08.512
So I took a z-pack
and the cold went away.

05:08.513 --> 05:11.481
A week later, cold came back.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.717
Two months later,
I caught another cold.

05:13.718 --> 05:15.852
Took more antibiotics
and a few weeks later,

05:15.853 --> 05:17.020
I got sick again.

05:17.021 --> 05:18.922
- All right, tell me
if any of this hurts.

05:18.923 --> 05:20.390
- Please.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.859
Last week, I was a p.O.W.
For six months.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.162
Ahh!
A little bit.

05:25.163 --> 05:26.663
Three weeks ago,
I was sick again.

05:26.664 --> 05:28.599
Lower back pain, fever,

05:28.600 --> 05:30.667
The nausea, same story.

05:30.668 --> 05:32.236
- Stanley, are you taking
care of yourself?

05:32.237 --> 05:33.537
Do you exercise?

05:33.538 --> 05:35.239
- Well, I do those stairs
once a day.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.174
Once going up,
then I come down.

05:37.175 --> 05:39.743
Sometimes I go back up.

05:39.744 --> 05:40.877
- So I'll be in touch
as soon as we get

05:40.878 --> 05:42.045
Your blood work back
from the lab,

05:42.046 --> 05:43.280
Then we should have
a better idea

05:43.281 --> 05:44.081
Of what's going on with you.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.549
- Okay.

05:45.550 --> 05:46.583
- All I need now
is your signature

05:46.584 --> 05:47.584
For our clinic files.

05:47.585 --> 05:49.586
- Okay.

05:49.587 --> 05:52.856
And I, uh... I have
something for you.

05:59.797 --> 06:01.331
- Is something wrong?

06:01.332 --> 06:02.733
- It's a "cease and desist"
order from Dr. Blair

06:02.734 --> 06:04.301
And the rest of the board.
- What?

06:04.302 --> 06:06.069
- Hank, we just got served.

06:06.070 --> 06:08.138
They've closed our clinic.

06:08.139 --> 06:09.706
- You're a process server?

06:09.707 --> 06:12.175
- It's my day job.

06:12.176 --> 06:14.878
The good news is that
I really am sick.

06:14.879 --> 06:17.281

06:47.628 --> 06:49.763
- I can't believe that
the clinic was shut down.

06:49.764 --> 06:51.698
- Hopefully, not for long.
Jill's all over it.

06:51.699 --> 06:53.933
Wants us to stay focused
on our patients.

06:53.934 --> 06:55.368
- Which explains why you sent
Stanley's blood work

06:55.369 --> 06:56.569
To the lab.

06:56.570 --> 06:57.771
- Yeah, well, some part of him

06:57.772 --> 07:00.507
Had to get out
of that basement.

07:00.508 --> 07:02.208
Remind me again
who we're seeing.

07:02.209 --> 07:03.576
- The philips family.

07:03.577 --> 07:07.080
Ted philips sold his successful
energy water company

07:07.081 --> 07:08.314
Around a year ago.

07:08.315 --> 07:09.649
He's been traveling
around the world

07:09.650 --> 07:11.584
With his wife and kids
ever since.

07:11.585 --> 07:14.554
He is in the hamptons
to pick up his father

07:14.555 --> 07:16.189
To join them on the rest
of their trip.

07:17.825 --> 07:19.859
- Thanks again for coming
on such short notice.

07:19.860 --> 07:22.062
Kids?

07:22.063 --> 07:27.067
Teddy, grace, please say
hello to our guests.

07:27.068 --> 07:28.868
<i>- Bonjour.
- Ni hao.</i>

07:28.869 --> 07:30.503
Hai.

07:30.504 --> 07:32.539
Show-offs.
Start packing, guys.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.140
71 hours till we're
airborne again.

07:34.141 --> 07:35.608
- Yes!

07:35.609 --> 07:37.877
- And this is my husband Ted.

07:37.878 --> 07:41.514
Barely landed and he's already
trying to launch a new business.

07:41.515 --> 07:42.849
Ingestible sunscreen.

07:42.850 --> 07:43.917
- Oh.

07:43.918 --> 07:45.819
- Honey, this is hankmed.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.721
- We'll be back from Russia
by the end of the month, right?

07:47.722 --> 07:49.222
- Next month.

07:49.223 --> 07:51.491
"family time" contract
doesn't end until then.

07:51.492 --> 07:52.992
- Uh, guys, it's great
to meet you.

07:52.993 --> 07:54.094
I'm confused though.

07:54.095 --> 07:55.495
Who here needs a doctor?

07:55.496 --> 07:57.263
- Um, we're all very healthy.

07:57.264 --> 07:59.132
- Well, there was
the Delhi belly week in India.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.300
It hit all of us.

08:00.301 --> 08:01.534
- Yeah, that was rough.

08:01.535 --> 08:03.069
- And then Teddy broke his toe
at machu picchu

08:03.070 --> 08:04.637
And I stepped on a sea urchin
in the Maldives.

08:04.638 --> 08:07.741
- Yes, but other than that,
we're all fine.

08:07.742 --> 08:10.443
It's my dad we're
worried about.

08:10.444 --> 08:13.613
He's had this smoker's cough
since before I was born,

08:13.614 --> 08:15.482
But he's gotten much worse.

08:15.483 --> 08:17.050
- Yeah, his father swears
he's fine,

08:17.051 --> 08:18.418
But we need to make sure,

08:18.419 --> 08:19.719
Especially before
we leave the U.S.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.920
- We're happy to take a look.

08:20.921 --> 08:22.489
- All righty, well, thank you.

08:22.490 --> 08:24.491
He's, uh...
- through here?

08:24.492 --> 08:25.725
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

08:25.726 --> 08:27.861
You're gonna need it.

08:27.862 --> 08:29.295
- Now come on, maddie.

08:29.296 --> 08:32.232
You know the difference
between femur and fibula.

08:32.232 --> 08:35.201
Use what's in your cranium.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.671
You two, don't just
stand there staring.

08:38.672 --> 08:39.972
Get in here.

08:41.342 --> 08:42.876
Femur.
- Femur.

08:42.876 --> 08:44.344
- Mm-hmm.
Fibula.

08:44.345 --> 08:45.612
- Fi... "fibulee."

08:45.613 --> 08:46.913
- Fibula.

08:46.914 --> 08:49.516
- Uh, Harrison philips,

08:49.517 --> 08:52.886
The father of arthroscopy
and the Philip's suture.

08:52.887 --> 08:54.287
- Yeah.

08:54.288 --> 08:55.288
Femur.

08:55.289 --> 08:56.356
- Femur.

08:56.357 --> 08:58.057
- Fibula.
- Fibula.

08:58.058 --> 09:00.560
- Excellent.

09:05.199 --> 09:07.901
- Emily's outflanked us
in sponsored links too,

09:07.902 --> 09:09.402
So now we face
a possible bidding war

09:09.403 --> 09:10.870
For whose business name
comes first

09:10.871 --> 09:12.472
When anyone searches for
"hamptons concierge medicine."

09:12.473 --> 09:14.107
- all right, tell me the truth.

09:14.108 --> 09:15.942
- What?
- Should I keep these?

09:15.943 --> 09:17.243
- Yeah, the look good on you.

09:17.244 --> 09:18.812
And of course Hank's
ignoring the fact

09:18.813 --> 09:20.513
That she's trading
on our name to generate

09:20.514 --> 09:22.949
Business for herself because
he's sleeping with her.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.450
Ugh!
He's sleeping with her!

09:24.451 --> 09:25.819
- Really?

09:25.820 --> 09:27.921
You know, I do think these
look great.

09:27.922 --> 09:29.956
But the price?
Aye-yi-yi.

09:29.957 --> 09:33.159
And who the hell
is Alexander wang anyway?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.427
- He's a well-known designer,
dad.

09:34.428 --> 09:35.962
Have you heard anything
that I just said,

09:35.963 --> 09:37.330
Or is it just impossible
for you

09:37.331 --> 09:38.965
To process anything negative
about Hank at all?

09:38.966 --> 09:40.266
- I hear every word you say.

09:40.267 --> 09:41.568
You're worried.
You're upset.

09:41.569 --> 09:44.637
You're nervous about losing
hankmed, okay?

09:44.638 --> 09:46.372
I understand that.

09:46.373 --> 09:48.708
You worked hard
to get your new life,

09:48.709 --> 09:51.044
But... and this
is a really big but.

09:51.045 --> 09:53.913
Evan, are you listening?

09:53.914 --> 09:58.017
You're letting your emotions
get in the way.

09:58.018 --> 10:00.787
Have you forgotten
the Lawson family motto?

10:00.788 --> 10:01.955
- "don't complain
about the problem.

10:01.956 --> 10:03.189
Fix it."

10:03.190 --> 10:06.559
- Exactly.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.127
And I think I can help you.

10:08.128 --> 10:09.996
I got a guy.

10:09.997 --> 10:11.865
Can make this situation
go away like that.

10:11.866 --> 10:12.999
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
- How?

10:14.001 --> 10:15.635
- What do you mean, "how"?

10:15.636 --> 10:18.972
He can whack her.

10:25.112 --> 10:26.179
- Are you out of your mind?

10:26.180 --> 10:27.947
I don't want to kill her, dad.

10:27.948 --> 10:29.249
- Kill her?

10:29.250 --> 10:30.149
What are you talking about
"kill her"?

10:30.150 --> 10:31.718
- You said...
- no, no, no.

10:31.719 --> 10:33.786
He's good at getting inside
those Web sites, you know?

10:33.787 --> 10:36.389
- Oh, my God.
You mean "hack her."

10:36.390 --> 10:38.157
He's out of touch.
- Okay, all right.

10:38.158 --> 10:41.060
Whatever you young people say,
he can do, right?

10:41.061 --> 10:42.528
He's a computer genius.

10:42.529 --> 10:46.733
He's a disgruntled
ex-google employee

10:46.734 --> 10:49.702
And he can, uh,
deal with Emily's threat.

10:49.703 --> 10:52.472
Listen, you know what?
I got to go.

10:52.473 --> 10:54.007
- Okay, tell me how much
he costs and let me know.

10:54.008 --> 10:57.677
- We'll figure it out lar.

10:57.678 --> 10:59.545
- All right, bye, dad.

10:59.546 --> 11:00.546
Oh, wait, dad.

11:00.547 --> 11:02.181
Pop?

11:02.182 --> 11:04.350
Hey, dad.
Dad!

11:32.913 --> 11:36.649
- So when were you
diagnosed with copd?

11:36.650 --> 11:39.585
- I prefer to call it
"emphysema."

11:39.586 --> 11:43.690
Sounds dirty,
smokey, appropriate.

11:43.691 --> 11:45.525
- Lean forward, please.

11:45.526 --> 11:47.827
16 years ago.

11:47.828 --> 11:50.596
- His blood pressure
is 198 over 93.

11:50.597 --> 11:53.066
- Breathe in and out for me,
please.

11:54.368 --> 11:57.603
- How much did you smoke?

11:57.604 --> 12:00.606
- Two packs a day, unfiltered.

12:00.607 --> 12:02.875
I gave 'em up six months ago.

12:02.876 --> 12:05.611
You let your girl
ask a patient questions?

12:05.612 --> 12:07.146
- Breathe again, please.

12:07.147 --> 12:08.715
- Uh, the name is divya

12:08.716 --> 12:09.916
And I'm not his girl.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.051
I'm his physician assistant.

12:12.052 --> 12:15.088
- And we both would like you to
make this trip with your family.

12:15.089 --> 12:17.256
- Oh, I'm gonna go.

12:17.257 --> 12:19.525
You don't say no
to my daughter-in-law.

12:19.526 --> 12:22.562
This whole globe-trotting
adventure was her idea.

12:22.563 --> 12:24.564
- I'd like to update
your albuterol,

12:24.565 --> 12:28.568
Add on a steroid inhaler,
and low-dose prednisone.

12:28.569 --> 12:30.336
- What else?

12:30.337 --> 12:32.171
- Lasix to help your
congestive heart failure

12:32.172 --> 12:34.574
And lisinopril to control
your blood pressure.

12:34.575 --> 12:36.242
- What about theophylline?

12:36.243 --> 12:38.811
My Manhattan internist used
to prescribe it,

12:38.812 --> 12:40.279
Then he stopped.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.814
- Uh, for good reason.

12:41.815 --> 12:44.083
- Yeah, hardly anyone prescribes
that anymore.

12:44.084 --> 12:46.719
Seizures, tremors,
nausea, vomiting.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.521
- Yeah, I'm well aware
of all the side effects.

12:48.522 --> 12:51.090
Thank you, but I haven't
had any.

12:51.091 --> 12:54.727
And it's the one medication that
used to make me feel better.

12:54.728 --> 12:57.797
- I feel confident
with my recommendations.

12:57.798 --> 13:02.168
If you want, I can bring
in a pulmonologist to consult.

13:02.169 --> 13:04.170
- That's the best idea
I've heard all day.

13:13.781 --> 13:15.148
- How soon will we get
the results?

13:15.149 --> 13:16.682
- Are there any other
pulmonologists

13:16.683 --> 13:18.051
On the registry
that might be available?

13:18.052 --> 13:19.452
Anyone at all?

13:19.453 --> 13:21.187
- That's in hundreds,
not thousands, right?

13:21.188 --> 13:22.922
Yes, yes, I can make that work.

13:22.923 --> 13:24.724
- Fantastic.
Thank you.

13:24.725 --> 13:25.892
- No, thank you.

13:25.893 --> 13:27.627
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

13:27.628 --> 13:29.128
yeah!

13:29.129 --> 13:31.164
- So the lab will
have Stanley's test results

13:31.165 --> 13:32.465
By 8:00 A.M. Tomorrow.

13:32.466 --> 13:33.733
You?

13:33.734 --> 13:35.435
- Every pulmonologist
in the tri-state area

13:35.436 --> 13:38.871
Is apparently booked
or on vacation.

13:38.872 --> 13:41.307
- Is he still in a snit
about Emily?

13:41.308 --> 13:43.109
- No, I'm not in a snit.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.310
I'm not that juvenile.

13:44.311 --> 13:45.745
- Happy to hear that,
because it turns out

13:45.746 --> 13:48.047
There is one other specialist
who's available.

13:48.048 --> 13:49.515
Emily.

13:49.516 --> 13:51.150
- Emily peck?

13:51.151 --> 13:52.885
- Yep, she did a fellowship
in pulmonary medicine.

13:52.886 --> 13:55.288
- Did you know the latin origin
of her name is "rival"?

13:55.289 --> 13:56.856
I didn't either.
I just looked it up.

13:56.857 --> 13:59.659
Working with her
is a horrible idea.

13:59.660 --> 14:01.160
Just gonna say it.
Just gonna say it.

14:01.161 --> 14:02.161
- She won't be working with me.

14:02.162 --> 14:03.262
She'll be working under me.

14:03.263 --> 14:05.164
- Oh, oh.
- Don't even go there.

14:05.165 --> 14:07.366
And only until Dr. Philips
is feeling better,

14:07.367 --> 14:09.235
So let's not make this
the drama it's not.

14:09.236 --> 14:10.870
- It's a great idea.
- Yeah.

14:10.871 --> 14:12.138
- Yeah.
You want me to call her?

14:12.139 --> 14:14.941
- No, it's okay.
I can handle this.

14:18.612 --> 14:19.846
- Are you out of your mind?

14:19.847 --> 14:22.148
What are you doing?

14:22.149 --> 14:23.349
We're not trying
to push them together.

14:23.350 --> 14:24.417
We're trying
to pull them apart, divya.

14:24.418 --> 14:27.553
- And that will happen
naturally.

14:27.554 --> 14:29.288
- How do you figure that?

14:29.289 --> 14:33.192
- Once Hank gets a chance
to work with her closely,

14:33.193 --> 14:34.861
I mean, he can't help
but see Emily

14:34.862 --> 14:37.230
For the up-selling,
elbow-rubbing, anti-hank

14:37.231 --> 14:40.266
That she truly is.

14:40.267 --> 14:41.567
- It's devious.
- Hmm.

14:41.568 --> 14:42.869
- It's risky.
- No.

14:42.870 --> 14:46.239
I know from experience.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.007
Trust me, Evan.

14:48.008 --> 14:50.376
Putting them together
is definitely

14:50.377 --> 14:53.446
Going to pull them apart.

14:53.447 --> 14:54.514
- High-freaking-five.

14:54.515 --> 14:56.582
- Now that is juvenile.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.951
- I will follow you around
all day like this.

15:05.022 --> 15:06.756
- Okay, thank you.

15:06.757 --> 15:09.292
Stanley, the war-mongering
process server,

15:09.293 --> 15:11.594
Has a white count at around
13,000 with a left shift.

15:11.595 --> 15:13.529
Uld be a hot appy.

15:13.530 --> 15:15.231
- Okay, I'm on it.

15:15.232 --> 15:18.367
I will find out if the pain
has migrated.

15:18.368 --> 15:20.002
Mr. Russell, hi.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.238
This is divya katdare.
I work with Hank...

15:22.239 --> 15:24.073
- Oh, my God!
I think I'm dying!

15:24.074 --> 15:27.043
- Okay, Mr. Russell, I need you
to hang up and call 9-1-1.

15:27.044 --> 15:28.978
Do you understand?
- Help me.

15:28.979 --> 15:31.280
- Stanley?
Stanley, are you there?

15:31.281 --> 15:32.582
- Hey, I'm sorry.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.250
I was just taking enemy fire.

15:34.251 --> 15:37.753
I'm fine although my stomach
does kind of bug.

15:37.754 --> 15:39.855
- Okay, you need to get
to a hospital right away.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.490
- I can't.

15:41.491 --> 15:42.892
My mom doesn't
get home till 4:00,

15:42.893 --> 15:45.461
So I don't have a car.

15:45.462 --> 15:47.363
- We will send someone to take
you to hamptons heritage.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.098
He'll be there shortly, okay?

15:49.099 --> 15:50.099
- Message received.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.567
Over and out.

15:51.568 --> 15:53.202
- But our appointment
was for 9:00.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.204
- Well, she arrived
about an hour ago.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.139
That woman knows
how to schmooze.

15:57.140 --> 15:59.609
- To repair chondromalacia

15:59.610 --> 16:03.346
Of the retropatellar cartilage,

16:03.347 --> 16:06.115
A small incision is
arthroscopically made to...

16:06.116 --> 16:08.851
You stop me if I need
to explain

16:08.852 --> 16:10.253
Any of these words, blondie.

16:10.254 --> 16:12.288
- Oh, please.

16:12.289 --> 16:14.690
I pay good money to look half
as smart as I am.

16:14.691 --> 16:16.726
The fluid gets injected
into the joint,

16:16.727 --> 16:17.860
Then the injury...

16:17.861 --> 16:20.062
- Enjoying the surgery channel?

16:20.063 --> 16:22.265
- Hello, Dr. Lawson.
- Hello.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.066
- Divya.
- Hmm.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.268
- We're just looking at a video

16:25.269 --> 16:27.603
Of my first
arthroscopic procedure.

16:27.604 --> 16:29.138
- Is that betamax?

16:29.139 --> 16:31.240
- Welcome to 1980.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.242
- Dr. Peck has kindly offered

16:33.243 --> 16:35.645
To transfer all
of my surgeries to DVD.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.647
- Well, that is kind of her.

16:37.648 --> 16:38.848
- You should see
these tapes, Hank.

16:38.849 --> 16:40.182
They are amazing.

16:40.183 --> 16:41.717
- Yes, as is the fact that
with three doctors

16:41.718 --> 16:43.319
In the room and one
of them wheezing,

16:43.320 --> 16:45.488
No one's made a move
for the albuterol.

16:45.489 --> 16:46.789
- I hate that junk.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.090
It makes me jittery.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.325
- He won't take it
more than once

16:49.326 --> 16:51.661
Every three hours,
despite my advice.

16:51.662 --> 16:52.795
- Right,
but the current practice

16:52.796 --> 16:54.897
Is to administer as needed.

16:54.898 --> 16:56.232
- I think I'm in trouble.

16:56.233 --> 16:59.468
- You're not in trouble.

16:59.469 --> 17:03.205
- Is that cigar yours?

17:03.206 --> 17:06.142
- Dr. Peck has approved
of the occasional draw.

17:06.143 --> 17:07.576
- Has she now?

17:07.577 --> 17:11.347
May I speak with you
in private, Dr. Peck?

17:11.348 --> 17:13.516
- Now you're in trouble.

17:13.517 --> 17:15.351
- Thank you.

17:15.352 --> 17:17.920
For a patient with emphysema,

17:17.921 --> 17:19.755
No amount of smoking
is acceptable.

17:19.756 --> 17:21.490
- He's an egomaniac
who's stuck in his ways.

17:21.491 --> 17:22.858
You know what doctors are like.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.160
- He's sick.

17:24.161 --> 17:25.828
He can't afford
to be non-compliant.

17:25.829 --> 17:28.030
- I agree, but he's never
gonna respond

17:28.031 --> 17:29.365
To being told what to do.

17:29.366 --> 17:30.800
You have to find achievable
improvements.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.301
- Well, we're not gonna
find them

17:32.302 --> 17:33.803
By letting our patient dictate
how we take care of him.

17:35.906 --> 17:36.939
- Hello?

17:36.940 --> 17:38.374
- How's the plan going?

17:38.375 --> 17:40.209
- Seems to be working.

17:40.210 --> 17:42.478
How are you?
Did you get Stanley?

17:42.479 --> 17:44.013
- Yeah, we're at hamptons
heritage right now.

17:44.014 --> 17:46.282
I've seen deli counters
move faster, by the way.

17:46.283 --> 17:47.750
How you doing?
You winning?

17:47.751 --> 17:50.319
Yeah, tell me again why we're
being so nice to ts guy.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.288
- Because he's sick
and he needs help.

17:52.289 --> 17:54.457
- So you and Hank are working
with our competition.

17:54.458 --> 17:57.626
I am now the unpaid chauffer
for Stanley,

17:57.627 --> 18:01.697
The subterranean cyber soldier
who's trying to kill our clinic.

18:01.698 --> 18:02.998
- Okay, let me call you back.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.706
- Jill?

18:10.707 --> 18:12.808
- Evan.

18:12.809 --> 18:14.210
Hi.

18:14.211 --> 18:15.444
- You have to help me.

18:15.445 --> 18:17.613
- Okay.

18:17.614 --> 18:19.548
- And open.

18:19.549 --> 18:20.850
No, no fever.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.852
When did maddie start coughing?

18:22.853 --> 18:24.720
- Last night,
but she didn't have a fever,

18:24.721 --> 18:26.055
So we weren't too concerned.

18:26.056 --> 18:27.390
- She's been fine all morning.

18:27.391 --> 18:29.125
- It's true.

18:29.126 --> 18:31.961
I'm okay...Mostly.

18:31.962 --> 18:33.429
- Maddie, I think your cough
is related

18:33.430 --> 18:35.531
To your grandfather's cough.

18:35.532 --> 18:38.534
- Last time I checked,
emphysema wasn't contagious.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.636
You sure you didn't get your
medical degree on the Internet?

18:40.637 --> 18:42.705
Dad.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.340
- No, you're right.

18:44.341 --> 18:45.808
You couldn't have given
maddie emphysema.

18:45.809 --> 18:48.077
- But you could have
given her pneumonia.

18:48.078 --> 18:50.913
- An X-ray will confirm this
for both of you,

18:50.914 --> 18:53.416
But I think you should start
a course of antibiotics.

18:53.417 --> 18:58.854
- Dr. Philips,
will you go first?

18:58.855 --> 19:00.656
- His name is Stanley Russell.

19:00.657 --> 19:02.191
He was a clinic patient.

19:02.192 --> 19:03.959
The last one before
it was closed.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.294
He's right over here.

19:05.295 --> 19:06.896
- Miss Casey, you do realize

19:06.897 --> 19:08.531
The injunction wasn't personal?

19:08.532 --> 19:10.132
- Of course.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.001
No offense taken.

19:12.002 --> 19:16.739
But unfortunately, my biggest
and most committed donor,

19:16.740 --> 19:18.574
Boris kuester
Von jurgens-ratenicz,

19:18.575 --> 19:19.942
Was not as understanding.

19:19.943 --> 19:21.310
- Really?

19:21.311 --> 19:23.045
I didn't realize he was one
of your benefactors.

19:23.046 --> 19:24.480
- Oh, yes.

19:24.481 --> 19:25.748
He doesn't just donate here
at the hospital.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.883
He also anonymously
gave to the clinic.

19:27.884 --> 19:31.587
Although I don't know how silent
he's going to be now.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.323
When I told him that the clinic
was closed indefinitely,

19:34.324 --> 19:35.691
He was furious.

19:35.692 --> 19:37.960
But like you said,
it's not personal.

19:37.961 --> 19:42.565
I'm sure he'll
realize that too.

19:42.566 --> 19:44.800
Stanley, this is Dr. Blair.

19:44.801 --> 19:46.202
- Hi.
- Doctor, he's got a hot appy.

19:46.203 --> 19:48.571
White count's 13,000
with a left shift.

19:48.572 --> 19:49.638
- Are you a doctor?

19:49.639 --> 19:50.840
- No, no, no.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.107
I am related to one though.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.609
Just to be clear though,

19:53.610 --> 19:54.944
"appy" means "appendix,"
not "appetizer," right?

19:54.945 --> 19:56.512
- Yes.
- Okay.

19:56.513 --> 19:58.380
So "hot" means "infected,"
not "oven-baked"?

19:58.381 --> 20:00.616
- Who are you?
- I'm...

20:00.617 --> 20:01.817
- Ah!

20:01.818 --> 20:03.552
- It's your appendix all right,
Mr. Russell.

20:03.553 --> 20:06.222
We need to get you in surgery
now before it bursts.

20:06.223 --> 20:08.257
- Surgery?
- That's exactly what Hank said.

20:08.258 --> 20:09.692
Nurse Stephens?

20:09.693 --> 20:11.126
- Just like that?
- Wait.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.394
You can't... please don't
let me die.

20:12.395 --> 20:13.829
- I won't.
They're gonna help you, okay?

20:13.830 --> 20:15.097
- Stanley, you're gonna be fine,
okay?

20:15.098 --> 20:16.298
- No, I'm talking to Evan,

20:16.299 --> 20:18.434
'cause my life
is in your hands snow.

20:18.435 --> 20:19.568
- Oh, your life.

20:19.569 --> 20:20.870
I got it.
Yeah.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.204
You're okay.
- Okay.

20:22.205 --> 20:23.506
- Okay, come on.
Let's go, guys.

20:23.507 --> 20:25.074
- Your life's in good hands.
Be a soldier.

20:25.075 --> 20:26.175
- Okay.
- I mean it.

20:26.176 --> 20:29.278
Hoo-ah.

20:29.279 --> 20:32.081
Um, Jill, talking to Boris?

20:32.082 --> 20:34.350
That's genius.

20:34.351 --> 20:36.185
- I didn't talk to Boris.

20:36.186 --> 20:39.221
- What?

20:39.222 --> 20:41.357
I was bluffing, Evan.

20:41.358 --> 20:42.491
- That's even genius-er.

20:42.492 --> 20:46.061
That's...
high-five.

20:46.062 --> 20:48.030
What is wrong with people?

20:57.507 --> 20:58.807
- Hi.

20:58.808 --> 21:00.009
After he vomited,
he started shaking

21:00.010 --> 21:01.310
And he hasn't stopped.

21:01.311 --> 21:02.478
Is this related
to the pneumonia?

21:02.479 --> 21:05.414
- Let's find out.

21:05.415 --> 21:06.582
Hi.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.250
- Damn it, Lynn.

21:08.251 --> 21:10.386
I told you I'm just fine.

21:30.473 --> 21:32.675
- I came as soon
as I got your message.

21:32.676 --> 21:34.276
- He's in multifocal
atrial tachycardia.

21:34.277 --> 21:36.812
- His heart rate's that fast?
- Irregular too.

21:36.813 --> 21:38.681
Which makes no sense,
considering the meds

21:38.682 --> 21:39.915
He's been taking.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.617
- Except it can occur
with theophylline.

21:41.618 --> 21:43.285
- Yeah, but he's not on that.

21:43.286 --> 21:44.720
- Yeah, he is.

21:44.721 --> 21:48.123
I gave it to him.

21:51.377 --> 21:52.611
- Nausea.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.079
Acute.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.881
Consistent.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.249
- Hank, I had him on a low dose
of theophylline.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.685
I have no idea how
his reaction is so big.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.855
- Doctor, that dose didn't
do anything.

22:02.856 --> 22:04.623
I helped myself to some extra.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.058
- Oh.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.226
- I've got the actidos.

22:07.227 --> 22:09.728
- Good.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.430
- How did he get
the theophylline?

22:11.431 --> 22:13.098
What, did he self-prescribe?

22:13.099 --> 22:14.967
- He didn't prescribe it.
I did.

22:14.968 --> 22:16.435
- Dr. Peck, you can take off.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.836
Divya will assist
with the gastric dialysis.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.004
- Hank, I'm not going anywhere.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.239
Not until
Dr. Philips is stable.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.240
We should get him
to hamptons heritage

22:21.241 --> 22:22.407
Or call the emts.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.342
- I can handle it
now that I know

22:23.343 --> 22:24.576
What's going on.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.178
- Should we intubate?
- Intubate?

22:26.179 --> 22:28.580
- Guys, guys,
let's just calm down.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.182
- Okay, you're right.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.416
We can handle
his difficulty breathing

22:31.417 --> 22:33.085
With steroids and albuterol.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.153
- Good.

22:34.154 --> 22:35.921
Why don't you prep
the nebulizer?

22:35.922 --> 22:39.324
Okay, divya, let's place
the nasogastric tube...

22:39.325 --> 22:41.126
- Not on my naso you're not.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.162
- We will nebulize 4% Lidocaine
by facemask,

22:43.163 --> 22:45.063
Which will anesthetize your
nose and throat

22:45.064 --> 22:47.032
And make this much
more comfortable.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.035
- Okay, go ahead, numb me.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.070
Let's just get this
the hell over with.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.473
- Okay, Dr. Peck,
please turn it.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.818
Swallow.
Swallow.

23:05.819 --> 23:09.388
Good.

23:09.389 --> 23:12.291
Okay, good.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.393
Mask on?

23:14.394 --> 23:17.763
- Mask on.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.264
His o2 sat's not improving.

23:19.265 --> 23:23.635
We have him on
Max beta two-agonists.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.003
I can barely hear breath sounds

23:25.004 --> 23:26.738
Because of his bronchospasm.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.373
- Okay, try I.V. Magnesium.

23:28.374 --> 23:32.611
2 grams over 20 minutes.

- Any shot at a cigar?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.059
- You're funny.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.029
- How about some breakfast?

24:30.203 --> 24:32.905
- Hello?

24:32.906 --> 24:34.773
Dad?

24:34.774 --> 24:37.276
- Excuse me, do not talk to me
about keeping promises

24:37.277 --> 24:40.612
And, yes, I can close the deal.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.014
I'll keep my end
of the bargain.

24:42.015 --> 24:43.482
Don't you worry.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.050
You know what?
I have to call you back.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.451
- Are you kidding me with this?

24:46.452 --> 24:47.719
- Huh?
- How did you...

24:47.720 --> 24:49.254
This is insane.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.523
- Yeah, isn't it?

24:51.524 --> 24:54.459
Ev, you have to call me before
you just pop over.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.094
- I did.
I called you twice.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.095
It just rang through.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.897
- Ahh.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.466
I just gothis contraption.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.536
$500 piece of art.
You know what?

25:04.537 --> 25:06.071
You can't even answer
a phone call.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.372
- I could teach you how
to use it.

25:07.373 --> 25:08.473
It's got two lines.
- You know what?

25:08.474 --> 25:09.574
Another time would be perfect.
- All right.

25:09.575 --> 25:12.444
So I came to return
these bad boys.

25:12.445 --> 25:13.779
You left them on the table
after all that.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.947
- Thank you.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.816
- And... oh, so comfortable.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.585
I came to thank you
for hacking Emily.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.587
- I'm very glad it worked out.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.256
- It so did, but wait,
there's more.

25:24.257 --> 25:27.359
If you act now,
for one low price,

25:27.360 --> 25:30.062
You can have public
humiliation as well.

25:30.063 --> 25:32.130
Check this out.
- Hmm?

25:32.131 --> 25:33.632
- See, if you search
for her Web site,

25:33.633 --> 25:36.835
It redirects you
to this piece of genius.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.036
Like, how did he even
find that?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.338
- Well, that's what he does.

25:39.339 --> 25:41.273
- Oh.

25:41.274 --> 25:45.510
This is like heaven.

25:45.511 --> 25:46.611
You all right?

25:46.612 --> 25:48.013
- Actually, I'm dealing

25:48.014 --> 25:50.248
With some major work issues.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.550
- Really?

25:51.551 --> 25:52.784
Anything I can help with?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.219
- No.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.088
I got incompetence,
impatience, impertinence.

25:56.089 --> 25:58.190
I got idiots.
Idiots all around, Evan.

25:58.191 --> 25:59.591
- Well, don't complain
about the problem.

25:59.592 --> 26:00.859
Fix it.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.694
- Hey, huh?
Come on.

26:02.695 --> 26:05.530
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

26:05.531 --> 26:08.500
Listen, drive safely.
- Okay.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.168
- And thanks for coming.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.970
- Um, cool.
Okay.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.672
Who should I make
the check out to?

26:13.673 --> 26:14.940
- You know what?

26:14.941 --> 26:17.275
Call me old-fashioned.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.544
I like cash.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.246
- How's it looking?

26:21.247 --> 26:27.219
- Both maddie's and your test
results are negative.

26:27.220 --> 26:30.822
- I don't have pneumonia.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.257
You did good, Dr. Lawson.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.727
- Well, coming from you,
that's high praise.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.797
- Look, now that
we've bonded...

26:40.099 --> 26:42.367
- What are the chances
of a brief encounter

26:42.368 --> 26:45.370
With one of my
lonely cigars, Hmm?

26:45.371 --> 26:47.839
- The chances of that
are slim to none

26:47.840 --> 26:49.041
And slim just left town.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.676
Sorry.
- Okay.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.046
Then how about a favor instead?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.514
Convince Ted they
should complete

26:55.515 --> 26:57.082
Their adventure without me.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.350
- What?

26:58.351 --> 26:59.851
Why do you need me
to tell him that?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.686
- 'cause he'll say no to me.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.488
- And he won't to me?

27:03.489 --> 27:05.057
- Not when you tell him
I'll be able

27:05.058 --> 27:06.658
To join him in three days.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.393
- Yeah, but you won't be,

27:08.394 --> 27:10.429
Which is why you want me
to tell him.

27:10.430 --> 27:12.464
- I will not be the reason
Ted and Lynn

27:12.465 --> 27:15.767
Don't get to finish
their adventure.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.836
My son works his tail off.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.938
He's got limited time
with his family.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.074
It's important to him.

27:22.075 --> 27:25.243
To them.
To me.

27:25.244 --> 27:28.413
- How about this?

27:28.414 --> 27:33.952
I'll tell Ted that you're
hoping to join them.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.020
- Good enough for me.

27:35.021 --> 27:39.791
- Okay then.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.426
- I'd like to talk with you.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.761
- Sure.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.729
Your father's doing well.

27:44.730 --> 27:45.997
- He should never have been
as sick as he was

27:45.998 --> 27:47.232
In the first place.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.268
- Mr. Philips,
your father overdosed

27:50.269 --> 27:52.537
On the medicine theophylline.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.973
It was prescribed,
but not taken as directed.

27:54.974 --> 27:58.243
- You have every right
to be upset.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.978
- Yeah, you're right.

27:59.979 --> 28:01.413
I do.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.882
- I would be furious
if something like that

28:03.883 --> 28:06.318
Happened to my father.

28:06.319 --> 28:10.288
But with theophylline,
the line between toxic and safe

28:10.289 --> 28:11.623
Is a thin one.

28:11.624 --> 28:15.127
What matters is that
Dr. Philips is stable.

28:15.128 --> 28:18.296
The meds are out
of his system and I think

28:18.297 --> 28:22.334
We can all say that this will
never happen again.

28:22.335 --> 28:27.105
I'm sorry it did.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.074
- I'm gonna go see my father.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.855
- Long night?
- Ah!

28:43.856 --> 28:45.557
- Let me guess, actually.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.993
You were sleeping with
the Emily again, weren't you?

28:47.994 --> 28:49.895
- Okay.
- I won't be ignored, Henry.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.830
Okay?
We're gonna talk about this.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.632
- Okay, start talking.

28:53.633 --> 28:55.600
I'm gonna catch up
on some emails.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.469
- Okay, I'm gonna illustrate.

28:57.470 --> 29:01.173
On one hand, we have...

29:01.174 --> 29:03.441
We have you, Hank, of hankmed.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.809
Okay?

29:04.810 --> 29:06.545
On the other hand,
we have Emily, the succubus.

29:06.546 --> 29:08.213
So hankmed over here.

29:08.214 --> 29:11.183
The competition over here.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.885
- Which hand
is the succubus hand?

29:13.886 --> 29:16.021
- Okay, I'm familiar
with the expression,

29:16.022 --> 29:19.191
"keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer," okay?

29:19.192 --> 29:20.892
You're taking it way
too literally.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.694
So let me illustrate again.

29:22.695 --> 29:23.695
- Ev, that's the last one.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.096
- Uh-uh!

29:25.097 --> 29:27.666
This is what we do
to our competition, okay?

29:27.667 --> 29:28.767
We crush 'em like a bug.

29:32.305 --> 29:34.573
- All right, that was
wonderfully illustrated.

29:34.574 --> 29:35.907
Really, that was poignant.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.976
Are you done?

29:37.977 --> 29:40.011
Okay, good.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.213
Emily is not trying
to bring hankmed down.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.214
- Are you...

29:42.215 --> 29:43.915
- You don't need to worry.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.617
Look, we're having
fun together.

29:45.618 --> 29:48.687
That's all it is.

29:48.688 --> 29:50.789
Oh, good luck opening it.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.836
- Hello.
- Morning.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.705
- Have you seen
Dr. Philips already?

30:06.706 --> 30:08.540
- No, I was waiting
for both of you.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.175
- Oh.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.210
Okay, let's go.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.783
- You hear that?

30:18.784 --> 30:20.452
- I don't hear anything.

30:20.453 --> 30:21.720
- Exactly.

30:21.721 --> 30:24.089
The vagabonds have left
for the airport.

30:26.692 --> 30:29.060
- Dr. Philips, when did
your cough start up again?

30:29.061 --> 30:31.563
- To be honest with you,
it never went away.

30:31.564 --> 30:33.465
- That's odd.

30:33.466 --> 30:35.100
Have you been taking
your antibiotics?

30:35.101 --> 30:36.635
- Exactly as directed.

30:36.636 --> 30:38.637
- You should be feeling better.

30:38.638 --> 30:40.872
- Yeah, well,
you tell that to my lungs.

30:45.478 --> 30:47.412
- That rash is petechial.
- Mm-hmm.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.314
- And with paroxysms.

30:49.315 --> 30:52.784
- There's only one thing
it could be.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.091
Hello!

31:00.092 --> 31:02.193
- Is it my father?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.396
- Your father's okay.
Divya's th him.

31:04.397 --> 31:05.964
- We tried your cell.
- What is it?

31:05.965 --> 31:07.399
What's the matter?
- We think maddie's sick.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.601
- What?
- What do you mean "sick"?

31:09.602 --> 31:13.204
- Could you pull
her shirt back?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.439
- What is that?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.807
- How'd you know
that was there?

31:15.808 --> 31:17.409
- Maddie has a highly
contagious disease,

31:17.410 --> 31:19.811
Whooping cough,
and so does your father.

31:19.812 --> 31:22.380
And you guys may have it too.

31:26.392 --> 31:27.592
- Eddie r. Lawson,
where are you?

31:27.593 --> 31:29.227
Your extra hot cap is now

31:29.228 --> 31:30.428
A room temperature cap, pops,

31:30.429 --> 31:31.930
And it's dropping fast.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.098
Pop, if you can't figure out
the call waiting on your phone,

31:34.099 --> 31:35.266
There's two buttons.

31:35.267 --> 31:36.801
They're at the bottom
of the phone.

31:36.802 --> 31:38.970
Ugh, never mind.
I'm here.

31:38.971 --> 31:41.205
I'm still here
at eden's garden.

31:41.206 --> 31:45.910
I have your money, so.

31:45.911 --> 31:47.712
Oh, my God.

31:47.713 --> 31:49.080
You got out of the hospital
so fast.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.348
- Thanks to you.

31:50.349 --> 31:51.649
You know, my appendix would
have exploded

31:51.650 --> 31:52.717
Li nitroglycerine.

31:52.718 --> 31:54.619
Kaboom.

31:54.620 --> 31:55.753
- Oh, don't stop
on my account, man.

31:55.754 --> 31:57.121
You're gonna kill your
avatar, dude.

31:57.122 --> 31:58.222
- I'm this close
to getting the insurgents.

31:58.223 --> 31:59.457
They need to take
a break anyway.

31:59.458 --> 32:03.194
Listen, uh...
Can I buy you a nice cup of Joe?

32:03.195 --> 32:05.563
And I want to apologize
for having to serve you guys.

32:05.564 --> 32:07.932
Okay?
It's the worst part of my job.

32:07.933 --> 32:09.634
- Dude, you're a process server.
That is your job, right?

32:09.635 --> 32:11.402
- Yeah, well,
I still hate doing it.

32:11.403 --> 32:13.071
- You hate it?
Why do you do it?

32:13.072 --> 32:15.106
- I get to meet people.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.975
And believe it or not,
social interaction

32:16.976 --> 32:18.409
Hasn't always come easy for me.

32:18.410 --> 32:20.345
Plus I get to make my own hours

32:20.346 --> 32:22.280
And with the economy
the way it is...

32:22.281 --> 32:23.781
- Triple latte for Felix!

32:23.782 --> 32:26.451
- Right here.

32:26.452 --> 32:28.119
Right here.
I'm coming.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.254
- Hostile detected.

32:30.255 --> 32:31.656
Time to move.

32:31.657 --> 32:33.257
- What? Who?
That guy?

32:33.258 --> 32:35.593
No way.
What did he do?

32:35.594 --> 32:38.096
- That's on a need-to-know
and I don't need to know.

32:38.097 --> 32:39.497
I just follow orders.

32:39.498 --> 32:40.898
- Right.

32:40.899 --> 32:41.966
Stanley, if you hate your job,

32:41.967 --> 32:43.334
Why don't you just
get a new job?

32:43.335 --> 32:44.502
I don't want to sound preachy.

32:44.503 --> 32:46.104
I recently... I did.

32:46.105 --> 32:48.773
So hating your job is no way
to live life, man.

32:48.774 --> 32:51.342
For you or your avatar
and you got to look out

32:51.343 --> 32:52.644
For him too, right?

32:52.645 --> 32:54.278
- Yeah, you'd be
a great platoon leader.

32:54.279 --> 32:56.014
Great platoon leader.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.815
- Thank you.

32:57.816 --> 32:59.617
Absolutely.

32:59.618 --> 33:01.653
Do you want to...
okay.

33:01.654 --> 33:03.921
Um, maybe I'll run into you
in cyberspace sometime.

33:03.922 --> 33:05.623
- Yeah, well, if you do,
you watch your six.

33:05.624 --> 33:07.091
- All right,
and you watch your seven.

33:07.092 --> 33:12.063
- I said you watch your six.

33:12.064 --> 33:14.032
Hey, Felix!

33:14.033 --> 33:16.868
- Okay.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.970
There you go.

33:18.971 --> 33:20.838
- So, doc,
how's the old man doing?

33:20.839 --> 33:23.207
- Better.
Much better.

33:23.208 --> 33:24.208
- It's a good thing
you stuck around long enough

33:24.209 --> 33:25.443
To see his rash.

33:25.444 --> 33:26.611
- Now there's a sentence
you just don't

33:26.612 --> 33:28.846
Hear very often, huh?

33:28.847 --> 33:30.882
- I am curious how maddie
got whooping cough

33:30.883 --> 33:32.150
And the other kids didn't.

33:32.151 --> 33:33.751
- Well, Teddy and grace
were immunized,

33:33.752 --> 33:35.086
But when maddie was born,
there was a lot

33:35.087 --> 33:36.821
Of controversy over
immunization, so...

33:36.822 --> 33:38.890
- So we decided to err
on the side of caution.

33:38.891 --> 33:41.626
- Right.
Why ask a doctor?

33:41.627 --> 33:44.395
- And Dr. Philips
was susceptible because?

33:44.396 --> 33:46.264
- Because I've outlived
my immunization.

33:46.265 --> 33:49.200
Another wonderful byproduct
of growing older.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.902
- But how did maddie
get it in the first place?

33:50.903 --> 33:52.070
- She could have
easily picked it up

33:52.071 --> 33:54.405
On one of your
off-the-beaten-path adventures.

33:54.406 --> 33:56.474
- So when do you think she'll
be well enough to travel?

33:56.475 --> 33:57.875
- At least six weeks.

33:57.876 --> 33:59.410
I'm afraid your family trip
is gonna have to wait.

33:59.411 --> 34:00.678
- Of course it will.

34:00.679 --> 34:01.779
We'll continue our
adventure here.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.715
All of us together.

34:03.716 --> 34:06.884
- Should be a great adventure.

34:06.885 --> 34:07.985
- It's a pleasure.

34:07.986 --> 34:09.253
- Pleasure here, blondie.

34:09.254 --> 34:11.121
Take care.

34:11.123 --> 34:13.558
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

34:13.559 --> 34:16.293
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

34:16.295 --> 34:18.596
I got something for you.

34:18.597 --> 34:22.433
I'm about to give you some
of my most prized possessions.

34:22.434 --> 34:24.001
- Well, uh...

34:24.002 --> 34:25.737
- Yeah, but you can't
smoke them.

34:25.737 --> 34:27.004
- true, true.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.505
Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

34:28.507 --> 34:29.940
Take care, Hank.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.074
- Will do.
- Take care.

34:31.076 --> 34:33.911
- All right, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

34:33.911 --> 34:36.214
- Don't smoke 'em all at once,
all right there?

34:36.215 --> 34:38.149
Thank you.

34:42.353 --> 34:44.621
- You must not think
I'm a very good doctor.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.389
- We have different methods.

34:46.391 --> 34:49.393
- Which means you don't think
I'm a very good doctor.

34:49.393 --> 34:51.161
- You were the pulmonologist
I brought in

34:51.163 --> 34:54.098
And you did something
I completely disagree with.

34:54.099 --> 34:55.733
- Look, Hank,
if I'd known how you felt

34:55.734 --> 34:57.802
About the theophylline, I would
never have prescribed it.

34:57.803 --> 34:59.904
- Right, well, you could have
talked to me about it first.

34:59.905 --> 35:02.406
- I'm sorry.

35:02.407 --> 35:03.775
- Look, you screwed up.

35:03.776 --> 35:05.243
You know that.

35:05.244 --> 35:07.145
The important thing
is Dr. Philips is okay.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.280
- No thanks to me.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.415
- You are hard on yourself.

35:11.416 --> 35:14.051
- Yeah, well, if I'm gonna hold
others to high standards,

35:14.052 --> 35:18.556
The least I can do is expect
the same of myself.

35:18.557 --> 35:20.858
- Let me cook you dinner.

35:20.859 --> 35:21.893
Distract you.

35:21.894 --> 35:24.095
- I didn't know you can cook.

35:24.096 --> 35:27.398
- I can't.
That's why it'll distract you.

35:27.399 --> 35:29.567
- As appetizing as that sounds,

35:29.568 --> 35:31.068
I've got to get up early
in the morning.

35:31.069 --> 35:32.403
I have a flight to catch.

35:32.404 --> 35:33.738
- To where?

35:33.739 --> 35:35.273
- San Diego.

35:35.274 --> 35:36.474
- Self-exile?

35:36.475 --> 35:38.309
- Worse.
Family.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.411
- Oh, okay.

35:40.412 --> 35:42.513
- It's only for a few days.

35:42.514 --> 35:44.482
I'm overdue a visit
so they can hound me

35:44.483 --> 35:46.350
About why I'm not married.

35:46.351 --> 35:48.586
- I'll save you the airfare.
Why aren't you married?

35:48.587 --> 35:50.755
- Maybe I haven't
met the right guy.

35:50.756 --> 35:53.291
- Well, when you do,
tell him I say "hello."

35:53.292 --> 35:57.528
- I'll do that.

35:57.529 --> 35:59.363
Oh.

35:59.364 --> 36:03.768
Tell Evan I want a truce
on the digital warfare.

36:03.769 --> 36:05.002
- I have no idea
what that means,

36:05.003 --> 36:06.337
And I'm thinking
that's a good thing.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.839
What?

36:07.840 --> 36:11.509
Now I am sure
that's a good thing.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.344
- He plays dirty and I like it.

36:13.345 --> 36:16.280
- And that's why you became
employee of the month.

36:18.383 --> 36:20.351
- Jill...

36:20.352 --> 36:22.386
You have a minute?
- Sure.

36:22.387 --> 36:24.121
- I just want to let you know

36:24.122 --> 36:27.725
That hamptons heritage
is dropping its lawsuit.

36:27.726 --> 36:30.294
- You are?
Uh...

36:30.295 --> 36:32.063
They are?

36:32.064 --> 36:33.564
- While we believe
that the clinic

36:33.565 --> 36:35.833
Should be run through
the hospital,

36:35.834 --> 36:37.969
I also know that patient care

36:37.970 --> 36:39.871
Is always the most
important thing.

36:39.872 --> 36:41.572
Always.

36:41.573 --> 36:46.844
- Well...We agree on that.

36:46.845 --> 36:48.045
Dr. Blair?

36:48.046 --> 36:49.113
Thank you.

36:49.114 --> 36:50.848
Really.

36:50.849 --> 36:53.117
And I just wanted to say

36:53.118 --> 36:56.587
I appreciate you coming here
to tell me this yourself.

37:06.865 --> 37:09.600
- Unfortunately,
my top candidate

37:09.601 --> 37:12.904
Has reconsidered
joining hankmed.

37:12.905 --> 37:14.205
- She seemed uptight.

37:14.206 --> 37:15.640
Kind of like you.

37:15.641 --> 37:19.010
- Okay, guys, are there
any other options?

37:19.011 --> 37:20.745
- Actually, there is one.

37:20.746 --> 37:26.751
Emily peck.

37:26.752 --> 37:29.220
- Yes, that's a good idea.
That's true.

37:29.221 --> 37:30.388
I'm surprised I didn't
think of that.

37:30.389 --> 37:31.923
That's... you know,
I heard

37:31.924 --> 37:33.891
Jack kevorkian got
out of prison,

37:33.892 --> 37:35.459
So he's available.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.595
- Having another doctor,
one with complete autonomy,

37:37.596 --> 37:39.063
Would give hankmed
more bandwidth,

37:39.064 --> 37:41.866
And as an employee,

37:41.867 --> 37:44.101
She would no longer
be competition.

37:44.102 --> 37:46.237
- Okay, Hank, would you tell
her how insane she is?

37:46.238 --> 37:48.039
- I got to say
it's not a bad idea.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.942
- It's not?
- No.

37:50.943 --> 37:51.943
- Yes, it is.

37:51.944 --> 37:53.644
It's a terrible idea.

37:53.645 --> 37:54.879
Divya, you traitor.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.114
What happened to elbow rubbing
and up-selling

37:57.115 --> 37:58.115
And anti-hank?

37:58.116 --> 37:59.317
- Anti what?
What are you...

37:59.318 --> 38:01.452
- I changed my mind.

38:01.453 --> 38:02.954
- Oh, oh.

38:02.955 --> 38:05.890
- Actually, Emily did.

38:05.891 --> 38:07.158
- Yeah, she does that.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.160
- Uh.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.928
- Uh, Evan?

38:10.929 --> 38:12.296
- Wild breaking pitch again,

38:12.297 --> 38:14.799
But Johnson lays off nicely.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
And the pitch is on the way.

38:15.801 --> 38:17.068
Line drive...

38:17.069 --> 38:21.772
- Come on.

38:21.773 --> 38:23.040
- Hey, kiddo.

38:23.041 --> 38:24.642
- Hey.

38:24.643 --> 38:26.143
- Evan here?

38:26.144 --> 38:27.511
- No, he's out with Paige.

38:27.512 --> 38:29.814
- I think he's got something
for me.

38:29.815 --> 38:31.015
- He'll be back soon.
- Yeah?

38:31.016 --> 38:32.216
- Mm-hmm.

38:32.217 --> 38:33.284
- You just tell him I was here?

38:33.285 --> 38:34.785
- Okay.

38:39.091 --> 38:40.157
You can wait if you want.

38:40.158 --> 38:42.126
- You sure?

38:42.127 --> 38:44.028
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

38:44.029 --> 38:47.631
- Sure.

38:50.635 --> 38:51.802
You want a beer?

38:51.803 --> 38:55.806
- Are you kidding?

38:55.807 --> 38:56.874
Thanks.

38:56.875 --> 38:58.242
- Yeah.

39:13.625 --> 39:17.795
- This is like old times.

39:17.796 --> 39:20.731
You and me on the couch

39:20.732 --> 39:22.299
Watching our team lose.

39:41.771 --> 39:43.672
- Boris, been a long time.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.742
You wanted to see me?

39:46.743 --> 39:49.278
- Seems that being an anonymous
donor to your clinic

39:49.279 --> 39:51.146
No longer guarantees anonymity.

39:51.147 --> 39:54.817
- Someone said something?

39:54.818 --> 39:57.219
- Miss Casey, if I desired
anyone to, ;ow

39:57.220 --> 39:59.488
About my involvement, I would
have told them how myself.

39:59.489 --> 40:01.223
- I wanted Dr. Blair
to know how much

40:01.224 --> 40:02.224
The clinic meant to you.

40:02.225 --> 40:04.460
- Well, you crossed a line.

40:04.461 --> 40:06.962
- I'm sorry.
I didn't realize...

40:06.963 --> 40:09.231
- I cannot afford to have
my privacy jeopardized.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.866
Not by you.
Not by hankmed.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.868
Not by anyone.

40:12.869 --> 40:16.605
Especially not now.

40:16.606 --> 40:18.674
- Okay.

40:18.675 --> 40:22.244
It won't happen again.

40:22.245 --> 40:23.545
- I assure you it won't.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.548
Let yourself out.

40:52.041 --> 40:54.610
- Patient is a 42-year-old...

40:54.611 --> 40:56.245
- What the hell?

41:50.867 --> 41:53.268
- All right, Eddie, good job.

41:53.269 --> 41:55.537
- This is gonna knock you out.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.643
- What?

42:14.123 --> 42:15.791
Forget it, Eddie.
Thank you.

42:15.792 --> 42:18.727
- What do you mean "thank you"?
