00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:17.999
- ♪ Let's touch in public ♪
- It's catchy.

00:17.999 --> 00:18.999
- Dude, I'm shooting
a music video.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
- Holy sh**. What kind of tab
are you running up?

00:20.999 --> 00:21.999
- I'm already
in the thousands.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- Kristen walks in,
and then everything just goes--

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
- If she wasn't there,
would you have gotten fired?

00:32.999 --> 00:33.999
- Regardless, I'm still
gonna see her later.

00:33.999 --> 00:35.999
- "Oh, oh, bitch,
you got me fired,

00:35.999 --> 00:37.999
but I'm gonna sit
and have dinner with you."

00:37.999 --> 00:38.999
- I don't know if I'm gonna
go to jail for a month.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
I don't know.
Am I scared? Absolutely.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.999
My fate really is
in somebody else's hands.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
- You guys f***ing
talk sh** about me

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
like I'm a backstabbing,
selfish piece of sh**.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- I'm having
my own issues right now.

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
- We didn't have sex.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
I know that 100% on my life.

00:52.999 --> 00:55.999
The truth is, you know, Jenna
and I were definitely boning.

00:55.999 --> 00:58.999
- Schwartz said he invited you
to our engagement party.

00:58.999 --> 01:01.999
You...are welcome to come.

01:06.999 --> 01:09.999
- ♪ You know
that it's our time ♪

01:09.999 --> 01:12.999
♪ These are the best days ♪

01:12.999 --> 01:14.999
♪ Of our lives ♪

01:14.999 --> 01:18.999

your glasses high ♪

01:18.999 --> 01:22.999
♪ This one's
for you tonight ♪

01:24.999 --> 01:28.999
- ♪ Come and tell me
that you love me like that ♪

01:29.999 --> 01:31.999
- Also get
the pomegranate margarita.

01:31.999 --> 01:33.999
- Pomegranate margarita
and a raspberry.

01:33.999 --> 01:34.999
Perfect, okay,
I'll be right back.

01:34.999 --> 01:38.999
- Okay, thank you.
- Try this, strawberry gimlet.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
- Thank you so much
for giving me that eight-top.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.999
They gave me,
like, a $100 tip.

01:42.999 --> 01:43.999
- You know I got you, boo.

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
- Katie.
- Hi.

01:45.999 --> 01:47.999
I have a question for you.

01:47.999 --> 01:48.999
- Go on, a quick one.
- Okay.

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
So Tom and I want to have
an engagement party.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
We really want
something outdoors.

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
We want something that's,
like, elegant and gorgeous.

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
Could we maybe have
our engagement party

01:57.999 --> 01:59.000
at your house?

02:00.999 --> 02:01.999
- At my house?

02:01.999 --> 02:03.999
Oh, no.

02:03.999 --> 02:04.999
- I would bring in
my own tables,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.999
my own chairs, my own food.

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
You would not have
to lift a finger,

02:08.999 --> 02:10.999
and when we left, you would not
even know we were there.

02:11.999 --> 02:12.999
- When I close my eyes
and think about

02:12.999 --> 02:14.999
how I want
my engagement party to look,

02:14.999 --> 02:16.999
it would be just that.

02:16.999 --> 02:18.000
I know this is your home,

02:18.000 --> 02:19.999
and it's a huge imposition
to ask.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.999
I realize that.
I do.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
Lisa, I just really
need you to say yes.

02:25.999 --> 02:27.999
It's one little word,
three letters,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.999
one syllable, "yes."

02:29.999 --> 02:30.999
It feels good to say yes.

02:31.000 --> 02:31.999
I've sent an invitation.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.999
- So you've sent an invitation

02:33.999 --> 02:35.999
before you've even
discussed it with me?

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
- Well, I said that
there's going to be a party.

02:37.999 --> 02:40.999
- Okay, a small barbecue,
a small barbecue.

02:40.999 --> 02:43.999
You arrange everything,
and it comes in the same day,

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
and it's gone by 7:00, 8:00.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.999
- It's gone, yeah.
- And that's it.

02:47.999 --> 02:48.999
- Yes.
- Well, how many people?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.999
- My mom and my grandma
and Tom's mom...

02:50.999 --> 02:51.999
- Very good.
Yeah, yeah.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
- And my brothers.
- I'm good with that.

02:53.999 --> 02:54.999
I'm good with that.
That's, like, eight of you.

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
Yeah.
- I didn't write--

02:56.999 --> 02:58.999
- And then
this motley crew, right?

02:58.999 --> 03:01.999
- Plus Kristen and Stassi.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
- You're inviting Stassi
and Kristen to your engagement?

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
Are you out of your mind?

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
- I don't want to have people

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
that you don't feel
comfortable with there, but...

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
- I don't feel
comfortable with them.

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
- Fair enough.

03:10.999 --> 03:13.999
I was hoping to slide
Kristen and Stassi by Lisa,

03:13.999 --> 03:16.999
but that's just not
gonna work out.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
I'm sorry, Stassi and Kristen.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
Thank you. Thank you.

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
- Ugh!

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
- Thank you.
Ah!

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
- Perfect timing. I was just
pouring you some champers.

03:26.999 --> 03:27.999
- Thanks.
- Awesome.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.999
- What's cooking?

03:28.999 --> 03:31.999
- We just did
some choreography practice.

03:31.999 --> 03:34.999
My music video's shooting
this Saturday, in two days.

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
- Oh, my God, that's exciting.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- Thank you.
- Well, cheers.

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
Congrats.
- Thank you. Thank you.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
- Well, we'll get you in--
this is perfect timing then,

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
'cause we'll get you
all fresh and glowy.

03:42.999 --> 03:43.999
- Need to be ready
for my close-up.

03:43.999 --> 03:44.999
- Yeah.

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
- My other musical ventures

03:45.999 --> 03:48.999
have been more passion projects.

03:48.999 --> 03:51.999
♪ We got nothing to lose,
oh! ♪

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
But here we are.

03:53.999 --> 03:57.999
We're shooting our music video
as Charles McMansion.

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
I can't believe we're here.

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
- You're just gonna look
really good on camera.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.000
- That's important,
'cause I'm spending

04:02.999 --> 04:03.999
a lot of money on this video.

04:03.999 --> 04:06.999
Grip and electric equipment
is, like, $1,300.

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
Catering is $1,000.

04:08.999 --> 04:12.999
I just spent $934 on a permit.

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
LED lights,
all these electronics.

04:14.999 --> 04:18.999
We are at $9,000 and climbing,

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
and we haven't shot
a single frame yet.

04:20.999 --> 04:24.999
I've been told to have
$2,000 in cash on me on set.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.999
This is one of the most
expensive things

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
I've ever invested in.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.999
I don't really need coffee
these days.

04:31.999 --> 04:32.999
So what kind of products
are you using?

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
- We're gonna do
a little microderm,

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
a light peel,

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
and some hydrating
oxygen infusion.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
- Yeah, I don't want to do
a mask,

04:40.999 --> 04:41.999
'cause it kind of dries out
my skin.

04:41.999 --> 04:43.999
You know, it's just
your basic facial:

04:43.999 --> 04:46.999
steaming, extractions,
exfoliation,

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
microdermabrasion, infrared--

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
standard stuff.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.999
And the last thing I want is
a shot ruined by bad skin.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.999
♪ Ah! ♪

04:56.999 --> 04:58.999
- You look beautiful.
- Nice.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.999
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
- That's my boy.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
Back off, ladies.
He's mine.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.000
You're like a pretty princess.

05:22.999 --> 05:24.999
- Hello.

05:24.999 --> 05:25.999
- Hello.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
- How are you?
- Good.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
James has been blowing up
my phone.

05:29.999 --> 05:32.999
He's been trying to get me
to meet up with him so badly,

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
and I finally gave in.

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
- Well, I have your wine list
here for you.

05:36.999 --> 05:37.999
- I can order wine, right?
- Yeah, absolutely.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
- Sauvignon blanc.
- Sure.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
- I'm just gonna have
water tonight. Cheers, mate.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.999
- I'll get that right away.
Sure, you bet.

05:42.999 --> 05:45.999
- I'm also excited
to drink a lot of wine

05:45.999 --> 05:47.999
in front of him
while he's trying to be sober.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
How's sobriety?
- It's good.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
It's a week today.
Gonna keep it going.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
- For how long?

05:52.999 --> 05:53.999
- As long as I can, really.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.999
Lisa's basically put me
on cliffside,

05:55.999 --> 05:57.999
so, you know,
I've really got no choice

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
but to pull myself up
at this point.

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
- I really hope
that was rock bottom.

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
- That was 100% rock bottom.

06:01.999 --> 06:03.999
I definitely miss Kristen.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
I regret every bad word
I ever said to her.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.999
You're never gonna get married,
and if you do,

06:07.999 --> 06:08.999
you're gonna be divorced
in the first three years.

06:08.999 --> 06:11.000
- Really? Really? Really?
- Yeah, f*** yeah, you will be.

06:11.999 --> 06:12.999
And you're gonna cheat
on your f***ing husband.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.000
You've got nothing
going for you.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.999
You've got nothing
but a sh**y T-shirt line.

06:15.999 --> 06:18.999
I have a temper
that loses it sometimes,

06:18.999 --> 06:21.999
and I just want her to realize
that I'm sorry

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
and that I'm gonna work
on being the guy

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
that, you know, my mum
raised me to be.

06:25.999 --> 06:28.000
- I've moved on.
Yes, I have, and I'm happy.

06:28.999 --> 06:29.999
I can be friendly with you.

06:29.999 --> 06:32.999
I just don't want
to disrespect Carter.

06:32.999 --> 06:36.999
The best thing about Carter is
that he's smarter than me

06:36.999 --> 06:39.999
and he has perfect measurements,
total boyfriend material.

06:39.999 --> 06:40.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.999
- You're welcome.

06:42.999 --> 06:43.999
- Don't you remember
filling your apartment

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
with balloons, like,
every week?

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
- Yes, and do you know how--
how easily that was all erased

06:47.999 --> 06:50.999
because how horrible the things
that you said to me were?

06:50.999 --> 06:51.999
- When I love, I love hard,

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
and when I hate, like,
I f***ing hate hard, I guess.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
I don't know
what to say, Kristen.

06:55.999 --> 06:56.999
- You keep telling me
I broke your heart.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
- You did break
my f***ing heart.

06:58.999 --> 06:59.999
- I was so f***ing good
to you.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.999
- We got some oven-roasted
vegetables here for you.

07:02.999 --> 07:03.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.999
- You're welcome.
- Lovely. Cheers, mate.

07:06.999 --> 07:07.999
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
- How do you not miss me?
Like, I don't understand.

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
Like, we were
the f***ing sh**, Kristen.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.999
- Do you think it was easy
for me to see you

07:14.999 --> 07:16.999
with a f***ing ratchet
whorebag like Lala?

07:16.999 --> 07:17.999
- The first thing
you said about us was--

07:17.999 --> 07:18.999
- With her f***ing ghetto-ass?

07:18.999 --> 07:20.999
- We've never even had sex--

07:20.999 --> 07:21.999
- Did she try
to put a condom on you?

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
Did you get to that point?

07:23.999 --> 07:24.999
- Yeah, she couldn't even
get me hard.

07:24.999 --> 07:26.999
I'm not even interested,
darling.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- Did you sleep with Jenna?

07:30.999 --> 07:33.999
- Yeah.

07:33.999 --> 07:34.999
- Jenna is a good friend
of Scheana's.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.999
- Everybody gets a knife,
and we just carve.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
- You really want
to give me a knife?

07:38.999 --> 07:40.999
Jenna and I were friends
for a really long time.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
- I told you that.
- No, you didn't.

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
- Really?

07:44.999 --> 07:45.999
Well, yeah, I did.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.999
You are the most beautiful girl

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
I've ever laid eyes on.

07:53.999 --> 07:55.999
- I knew they f***ed,

07:55.999 --> 07:58.999
and I let him convince me
that they didn't.

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
What the f***
is the matter with me?

08:00.999 --> 08:01.999
I need to step away.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
- Fine,
responsibility ever.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.999
- I didn't f***ing
come here for this sh**.

08:06.999 --> 08:07.999
- Kristen?

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
- You say you want
to f***ing apologize

08:09.999 --> 08:10.999
and be nice and whatever,
and then you sh**--

08:10.999 --> 08:11.999
- Kristen, please.
- Please just give--

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
- Can I just have one hug?
I'm sorry.

08:13.999 --> 08:14.999
- No, not right now.
I need some space for a minute.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.999
- But I'm sorry, darling.

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
I didn't--I don't want you to--

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
- Please, can I just have
a minute?

08:22.999 --> 08:24.999
I don't even know why
I was holding on

08:24.999 --> 08:28.999
to this small, tiny piece
of James

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
that could be
a decent human being.

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
He's not.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
I just asked you if you slept
with Jenna,

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
and you started laughing at me,

08:36.999 --> 08:40.999
so can you just imagine that
maybe it hurts a little bit?

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
- Kristen, please
come back, please.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
- What did you want out of it?
You want--

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
- I don't know
what I wanted out of it.

08:46.999 --> 08:47.999
- You thought we were
gonna get back together?

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
- I miss you, Kristen.
I miss you.

08:49.999 --> 08:50.999
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.000
Like, honestly,
the most thing

08:52.999 --> 08:53.999
I miss about us is how we were
in the beginning,

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
like, when we were best friends
and we listened to music

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
till 6:00 in the morning
and we never fought.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
And, like, you were
my friend at first.

08:58.999 --> 08:59.999
Do you remember that?

08:59.999 --> 09:00.999
- Clearly, I do.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
- There's something that--
I can't help but miss her

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
when I see that little glare
in her eye.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.999
It's hard.
It's f***ing hard.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
Please, Kristen, I just
don't feel the same about you--

09:09.999 --> 09:12.999
with anybody else
like I did with you.

09:12.999 --> 09:15.999
- 'Cause I'm a f***ing catch,
and it's not ego talking.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.999
It's self-esteem that I've never
had in my entire life.

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
- So, what, it's too late now?

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
It's too late now
that I've realized that?

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
It's like--

09:21.999 --> 09:24.999
- It takes time to heal.
- All right, fine.

09:24.999 --> 09:25.999
- I don't hate you.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
- I don't hate you.

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
You know I love you, right?

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
- ♪ I'll pray that you come
back to me ♪

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
- What do you mean, you don't
know what to say, Kristen?

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
Yes, you do know what to say.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
Can I please have one hug?

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
- Don't push it.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
I want you to be okay.
I worry about you.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
- Well, you don't need
to worry about me.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.000
Stop worrying about me.
- I do worry about you.

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
- You don't need
to worry about me.

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
- Well, it feels good
to touch you.

09:55.999 --> 09:56.999
- Coming up...

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
- I need Saturday night off
to go to court.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
- You think they could
put you in jail?

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
- I don't know.

10:11.999 --> 10:15.999
♪ Love you like I'm reckless ♪

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
- Stassi.
Nice to meet you.

10:18.999 --> 10:19.999
- We have
your designs set up,

10:19.999 --> 10:22.999
and I just need to get an idea
of how you want it placed.

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
- Okay.
- Follow me to the back.

10:23.999 --> 10:24.999
Let's get it done.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
- I have been working
on my T-shirt line, James Mae,

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
for about a year and a half now.

10:29.999 --> 10:30.999
- That's so cool!

10:30.999 --> 10:33.999
- I went into business
originally with a woman

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
who had a background
in photography.

10:35.999 --> 10:37.999
She and I had
a huge falling out,

10:37.999 --> 10:41.999
and I essentially had to pay her
to not work for my company.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
This is actually really cool to
see this process.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
- That's perfect!
- So here's your end result.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
- Before I knew it,

10:47.999 --> 10:50.999
my five-minute-old company
was $4,000 in debt.

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
- We'll get you guys rolling.
Have a seat if you'd like.

10:52.999 --> 10:56.999
- Last month, we sold
just over 100 shirts,

10:56.999 --> 10:58.000
and it's picking up.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.999
- Whoo.
It's just so weird.

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
Like, I've never worn a T-shirt
in my life.

11:01.999 --> 11:03.999
- Would you wear my t-shirts?

11:03.999 --> 11:05.999
- Yeah, so I'll find a way
to glam it up.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.999
- I think Katie might come
to Brennan's tonight.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.000
I don't know.

11:10.999 --> 11:11.999
Carter lives on the west side,

11:11.999 --> 11:12.999
and he told me
about this really cool bar

11:13.000 --> 11:14.999
that does these turtle races.

11:14.999 --> 11:17.999
This is all a part
of my master plan.

11:17.999 --> 11:18.999
I want the gang
back together again.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.999
- Are they avoiding me?

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
- I don't know.
- We've been texting.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
- It sort of
didn't sound promising,

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
so let's just hope for the best.

11:26.999 --> 11:27.999
- This sucks.

11:27.999 --> 11:29.999
It's like, don't tell me
I got this far

11:29.999 --> 11:32.999
to not be able to get
that friendship back with Katie.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.999
So I know you didn't
sleep at James's,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.999
but you drunkenly told me
before I left, like,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
like, "Oh, my God,
like, we made out,

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
and duh-duh-duh-duh-duh,
and I know."

11:42.999 --> 11:45.999
So I haven't gotten actually,
like, the details.

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
So you made out in his car,
and that's it.

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
- Yes.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
- I brought this.

11:50.999 --> 11:51.999
This is a flash drive

11:51.999 --> 11:53.999
with the backing track
to our song.

11:53.999 --> 11:54.999
- Okay.

11:54.999 --> 11:55.999
- Lisa's basically
told me it's on hold.

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
I want to continue making it.
Maybe she'll change her mind.

11:57.999 --> 11:59.999
- So how was dinner
last night with Kristen?

11:59.999 --> 12:02.999
Do I need to check your arms
for the battle wounds?

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
Oh!

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
Now, did you guys hook up?

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
- Uh, no.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
- So what,
you just dropped her off

12:09.999 --> 12:11.000
and gave her a kiss
on the cheek?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
No.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
- Did you stay
in your seat,

12:15.999 --> 12:16.999
or did you get on his seat?

12:16.999 --> 12:17.999
- I stayed on my seat.

12:17.999 --> 12:20.000
- So there was no, like--
- There was no--

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
- There was no, like,
high school grinding?

12:21.999 --> 12:24.999
- Dry humping action
in front of my apartment.

12:24.999 --> 12:26.999
- At this phase
in the investigation,

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
I'm still gathering evidence.

12:28.999 --> 12:32.999
I'm looking for inconsistencies,
implausibilities,

12:32.999 --> 12:33.999
outright bullsh**.

12:33.999 --> 12:36.999
- All right,
so I pulled up

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
in the garage, right,
with Kristen,

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
and then we start making out
in the car, so--

12:40.999 --> 12:43.999
oh, my heart's pounding
right now.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
Oh, sh**.
So then--oh, sh**.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.999
So basically tells me,
"Oh, we can't go upstairs."

12:49.999 --> 12:51.999
And I'm like, "Why?
What's going on?"

12:51.999 --> 12:53.999
She's like, "Stassi's
sleeping in my bed."

12:54.000 --> 12:55.999
- Okay.

12:55.999 --> 12:57.999
- But there was no, like,
anything else?

12:57.999 --> 12:58.999
It was just making out?
- Yes.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.999
- And then you were like,
"I have to leave now.

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
This is not right," right?

13:03.999 --> 13:06.999
- We were definitely boning.

13:07.999 --> 13:11.999
- So we ended up having sex
on top of her Beamer.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
- What the f*** are you doing?

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
I'm just asking you.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
It's very weird
that I get jealous

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
when James tells me
that he slept with Kristen.

13:21.999 --> 13:24.999
I think he absolutely
has feelings for her still.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
You right now don't have
a job at Pump.

13:26.999 --> 13:30.999
Your CD that Lisa was so about

13:30.999 --> 13:31.999
is now being put on hold.

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
That's pretty f***ed up,

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
because the common denominator
is Kristen.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.999
What the f*** are you doing?
I'm just asking you.

13:38.999 --> 13:41.999
- When you put it like that,
I mean, I don't really know.

13:41.999 --> 13:42.999
- f*** this bitch for now.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
Focus on what matters,

13:44.999 --> 13:47.000
and, I don't know, maybe
get your job back?

13:53.999 --> 13:54.999
- Well, I'm just glad
we realized

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
that I was completely right
and you were completely wrong.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.999
- Shut up.

13:58.999 --> 14:00.999
- I've actually given control
of my life over to Katie,

14:00.999 --> 14:02.999
so she's actually
in charge now.

14:02.999 --> 14:03.999
But after
the neutering process,

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
it really wasn't that bad.

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
- So let's talk menu.

14:07.999 --> 14:08.999
What are you guys thinking?

14:08.999 --> 14:10.999
- So we're gonna have
this caterer

14:10.999 --> 14:12.999
that's gonna have--we're gonna
have some snacks,

14:12.999 --> 14:14.999
a salad, two side options,

14:14.999 --> 14:15.999
two entrée options,
and two dessert options.

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
- Bubby, whoa.

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
- That's what comes with it!
- Okay, okay.

14:19.999 --> 14:22.999
I wanted to just get tacos--
very simple, delicious.

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
Everyone loves tacos.

14:23.999 --> 14:24.999
She's going crazy
with the budget.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.999
- It's 4--we have, like,
40-something people coming.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
I'm planning
our engagement party.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
I have ideas,
and he doesn't like them,

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
but he's not gonna
do anything on his own

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
to make his own ideas
come through,

14:33.999 --> 14:36.999
so I just, by default,
end up winning.

14:36.999 --> 14:39.999
Chicken and the steak roast.

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
Now my favorite part,
two desserts.

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
Seasonal tarts du jour,

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
carrot cake
with caramel coffee mousse,

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
and triple chocolate cheesecake.

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
Well, I think--
- Carrot cake.

14:49.999 --> 14:50.999
- Carrot cake
and the chocolate cheesecake.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
- What is an engagement party?

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
Is an engagement party
me throwing a party

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
for everyone else on my tab

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
so they can eat
and just--shouldn't they be

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
paying for it or something?

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
I know you cared about it,

15:00.999 --> 15:02.999
but how engaged were you
in the process?

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
- I probably gave
about, like, 13.5%.

15:06.999 --> 15:07.999
- Do guys ever really have
that much involvement

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
in, like, the engagement party?

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
- Sandoval would.
- Sandoval would, yeah.

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
- Definitely.
- Of course.

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
- Wedding, it's mostly
for the girl, right?

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
They say it's for us,

15:15.999 --> 15:16.999
but it's mostly for the girl.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.999
- Well, here's the thing.
It's gonna be at Lisa's house.

15:19.999 --> 15:22.999
She did say that she does not
want Kristen or Stassi there.

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
- Seriously?

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
- Yeah,
and I have to--I mean,

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
I have to respect that.

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
- Totally.
No, I get that.

15:28.999 --> 15:32.999
At my engagement party, Kristen
admitted to sleeping with Jax.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
- Yes, I did have sex
with him one time.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
Oh, my God.

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
- Oh, my God!
- ****.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
- They knocked me over.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.999
- I can understand why Lisa
doesn't want them to come.

15:43.999 --> 15:47.999
- Anything that gets the party
at her house, I have to do that.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- Well, I know Kristen's
definitely gonna have a problem.

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999
Stassi will understand,

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
because Stassi
is very new coming back in.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
- Well, I don't know
what to tell Kristen

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
unless Kristen wants to spend
a trillion dollars

15:56.999 --> 15:57.999
to find me a new location.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.999
- Are you still inviting Ariana?
- What she said--

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
"I just am sitting here
pretending

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
like I'm having fun
with you guys."

16:03.000 --> 16:04.999
Well, you don't have to come
to our engagement party

16:05.000 --> 16:07.999
if it's, like, too much effort
for you to pretend to have fun.

16:07.999 --> 16:08.999
- Oh, no, no, bubby.
Let's not get crazy.

16:08.999 --> 16:09.999
- She said that.
- She said that, though!

16:09.999 --> 16:11.999
I'm not begging anyone to come.

16:11.999 --> 16:14.999
I don't want to be surrounded
by such negativity

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
when this is supposed to be
an event that's important

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
and leading up to our marriage.

16:18.999 --> 16:20.999
- Bubby, let's try to have
positive energy and focus--

16:20.999 --> 16:21.999
- I plan on doing that. You got
time to think about that.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
I got to figure out
what kind of food I want.

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
I don't have time to think
about Ariana's dumb feelings.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
- Food's important.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
- Can I start you guys off
with any drinks?

16:36.999 --> 16:38.999
- All right, you got it.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.999
Thank you.
I'll take your menus.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
- You busy?
- Yeah, but it's okay.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
What's going on?
Are you working now?

16:46.999 --> 16:47.999
- Yes,
but I'm on my break,

16:47.999 --> 16:49.000
and I'm using my break
to talk to you,

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
because I need--
well, I'm asking,

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
but I really need, 'cause
I'll go back to jail.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.999
I need to have Saturday night
off, if that's possible,

16:56.999 --> 16:59.999
because I have to take a redeye
back to Hawaii to go to court.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
I basically have to show up,
talk to the judge,

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
but I have
to physically be there.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
They--my lawyer said no Skyping.

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
I can't do that.
I have to physically be there.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
- Do you know what
the outcome is gonna be?

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
- I don't. I don't know what
the outcome is gonna be.

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
- You think they could
put you in jail?

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
- I don't know.
I don't know.

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
This could be
just a slap on the wrist,

17:17.999 --> 17:19.999
and it can go away, or this
could escalate even more,

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
and I could go to jail,

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
have more fines
slapped on top of me.

17:23.999 --> 17:24.999
It's really all up in the air,

17:24.999 --> 17:27.000
and it's up to the judge
at this point.

17:27.999 --> 17:28.999
- This is so ridiculous.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
Do you realize now this is
why I was so mad with you?

17:30.999 --> 17:31.999
- It's stupid.

17:31.999 --> 17:32.999
I think about it
all the time.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
- Because that's
why actions have consequences.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.999
- I know that.
- And this is--

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
I'm glad that you have to go
back to Hawaii, in a way,

17:37.999 --> 17:39.999
because it makes it more
of a pain in your ass.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
Have you really learned
a lesson from this?

17:41.999 --> 17:43.000
- Absolutely.
- Have you?

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
- Yes, when people say, "Oh,
he doesn't have a heart.

17:45.999 --> 17:46.999
He doesn't have a soul,"
what I did with Kristen,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.999
all those situations,

17:48.999 --> 17:49.999
it just didn't hit me
till later,

17:49.999 --> 17:50.999
because sometimes
I just don't feel

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
until I think back
and I sit down

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
and I have a chance to calm down
and be like, "Holy sh**,

17:54.999 --> 17:55.999
what the f***
did I do?"

17:55.999 --> 17:57.999
It's not that I don't have
a heart and I don't care

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
and I don't--sometimes
I do think I'm untouchable,

17:59.999 --> 18:01.999
but it doesn't hit me
until later; that's all.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.999
- You feel remorse?
- Yeah, absolutely.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
- The only thing
Jax does better

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
than get into trouble
is get out of it.

18:06.999 --> 18:08.999
He'll probably sweet-talk
the judge,

18:08.999 --> 18:10.999
have him in the palm
of his hand.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
He'll be back on the beach
in Hawaii with a cocktail,

18:12.999 --> 18:14.999
and, you know, that will be
the end of it.

18:14.999 --> 18:18.999
Turn this negative
into something constructive.

18:18.999 --> 18:19.999
- Absolutely, and that's
what I'm trying to do.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
- Okay, off you go.
- Okay.

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- And let me know
what happens with you.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
- I will. I will.

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
- Hopefully
I'll see you Tuesday.

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
- Yes.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
- Coming up...

18:30.999 --> 18:32.999
- Are you upset?

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
- It's just hard to hear.
- Are you crying?

18:33.999 --> 18:36.999
- I didn't realize that
that was the way you felt.

18:44.999 --> 18:45.999
♪ You know I love it ♪

18:45.999 --> 18:48.999
♪ Try to walk away,
but I can't do it ♪

18:48.999 --> 18:49.999
- I'm so excited.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.999
- I mean, I think I'm
gonna have to drink a lot

18:51.999 --> 18:52.999
to get excited about turtles.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.999
- Ooh, turtle--there's
a turtle racing pit.

18:55.999 --> 18:58.999
- Turtle races.

18:58.999 --> 18:59.999
- Hi.
- Hi!

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

19:01.999 --> 19:02.999
- What's up, buddy?
How are you?

19:02.999 --> 19:04.999
- Good to see you, dude.
- Good to see you too.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.999
- Do you know if Katie
and Tom are coming?

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
- Katie didn't respond.

19:08.999 --> 19:09.999
- I asked her to do something
on Saturday

19:10.000 --> 19:11.999
when we got back
from Palm Springs,

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
and I think
she was too hung over.

19:13.999 --> 19:16.999
I'm trying not to, like,
be aggressive.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
- Yeah, I mean, she knows
you're there, so...

19:18.999 --> 19:21.999
- I'm trying to be,
like, somewhat assertive.

19:21.999 --> 19:25.999
I understand if it takes Katie
a little while to trust this,

19:25.999 --> 19:26.999
but this is me.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.000
This is how I feel.

19:28.999 --> 19:30.000
I'm not putting on an act

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
to just revert to my old ways
in a few months.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
- Hi.
- Hey!

19:35.999 --> 19:36.999
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

19:36.999 --> 19:37.999
- Hey, guys.
- Yay!

19:37.999 --> 19:39.999
- You made it. You made it.

19:39.999 --> 19:42.999
- Hi.
- You're dressed appropriate.

19:42.999 --> 19:44.999
- I know, because
I'm freezing my tits off.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.999
- Why are you guys all fancy?
This is the turtle races.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
- I didn't know if--

19:48.999 --> 19:51.999
- The more
I am hanging around Stassi,

19:51.999 --> 19:54.999
the more I'm realizing how not
Stassi she is these days.

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
She's not being mean.

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
She's not bossing me around.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
It's refreshing;
I'll say that.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.999
I never thought
I would see you again

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
after the first first night
I met you.

20:04.999 --> 20:08.999
- Oh, like, many moons ago?
- Yeah.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.999
It's like a one-night stand
haunting me.

20:11.999 --> 20:14.999
- I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
- Katie and Carter...

20:16.999 --> 20:18.999
ah, you know,
how do I say this?

20:18.999 --> 20:19.999
Um...

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
His head is **** her.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.999
- I actually know
this Carter guy.

20:24.999 --> 20:27.999
We had a one-night stand.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.999
It was, like, a year
before I met Tom.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
Now he's back in my life.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.999
Thank you, Kristen.

20:34.999 --> 20:36.999
Of all the guys in L.A.

20:36.999 --> 20:39.999
- I'm cool with that.
I'm progressive, you know?

20:39.999 --> 20:41.999
It's in the past.
It's all good, baby.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.999
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen!

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
Welcome to turtle racing
here at Brennan's!

20:48.999 --> 20:50.999
- I think what they do is,
they put a bunch

20:50.999 --> 20:52.999
of turtles in the center
and they all just run out.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.999
- Do we have a turtle team,
or do we get our own team?

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
- Oh, so you rent a turtle
for $5.

20:57.999 --> 20:58.999
- Hey, you do it.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
- I can't even
rent an apartment,

20:59.999 --> 21:01.999
but I'm gonna try
and rent a turtle.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.999
Cool, do you have
to have good credit?

21:09.999 --> 21:10.999
The rules are annoying.

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
No standing if you sit
in the front row.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
- So it's like you can't
bend your knees?

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
- Don't throw anything
on the track.

21:16.999 --> 21:17.999
- Go! It's right there!

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
- Duh.
- No!

21:19.999 --> 21:22.999
don't be a douche bag.

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
Mm, have you looked
in the mirror lately?

21:24.999 --> 21:25.999
- I used to have a turtle.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
- Yeah, I've had many.
- I love reptiles.

21:27.999 --> 21:28.999
- You guys,
let's kidnap the turtles,

21:28.999 --> 21:31.999
bring them
to Lisa's f***ing sanctuary.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
- Yes, and give them
to the.

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
I don't love that Carter
took us to some dive bar

21:35.999 --> 21:37.999
to watch turtles race,

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
but I did f*** James,

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
so I'm not really
in a position to complain.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.999
- Go, go, go!
It's right there!

21:44.999 --> 21:46.000
No!

21:46.999 --> 21:49.999
- I want to talk to you
about the engagement party,

21:49.999 --> 21:52.999
because there's good
and bad news.

21:52.999 --> 21:55.999
Talked to Lisa
the other night.

21:55.999 --> 21:57.000
She agreed to let me have

21:57.999 --> 21:59.999
an engagement party
barbecue thing at her house,

21:59.999 --> 22:00.999
but I have to be honest, though.

22:00.999 --> 22:03.999
When I did tell Lisa
that I had invited you guys,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.999
she was pretty adamant

22:07.999 --> 22:11.999
that she preferred
you not be there.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
- Oh, my God,
I have so many rageful feelings

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
right now that, like, I--
hateful feelings

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
that I don't even want to--I--

22:17.999 --> 22:21.000
- I missed Scheana's
rehearsal dinner at Sur

22:21.999 --> 22:22.999
because Lisa wanted to,
like, ban me.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I'm her scapegoat.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
Lisa loves to hold a grudge.

22:26.999 --> 22:27.999
I don't even work there anymore,

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
and she'll still find
a way to yell at me.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
- It's an awkward position.

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
It's--I'm
in an awkward position.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
- This blows.

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
If Katie and I are back
to being, like,

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
total friends again

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
and I can't go
to her engagement party...

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I'm not Kristen;
I'm not gonna go to Lisa's house

22:41.999 --> 22:42.999
if she doesn't want me there.

22:42.999 --> 22:44.999
- It's like arguing
with the principal.

22:44.999 --> 22:46.999
- No, 100%.
- There's no point.

22:46.999 --> 22:47.999
- 100%.
- I'm in an awkward position.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.999
I have to focus on the party.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
Like, my mom's
coming to town, and I can't--

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
- I don't really
actually know, really,

22:55.999 --> 22:56.999
how to make sense of this.

23:03.999 --> 23:06.999
- I'm a little sore
in this dress still.

23:06.999 --> 23:08.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
Aw, you're pulling my chair out.

23:14.999 --> 23:17.999
- Put on the charm
once in a while.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
- All right, I'm starving.
- I've never been here.

23:22.999 --> 23:23.999
But I just heard
about this place.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
- There.
This is our menu.

23:25.999 --> 23:27.999
Basically, our food menu,
it's a tapas-style menu.

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
- She's gonna have
the salmon.

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
I'm gonna do the steak
and the prawns

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
and the brussels sprouts.

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
Okay, sounds great.
Thank you.

23:35.999 --> 23:36.999
- Well, you look
handsome tonight.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
- Well, you look beautiful.

23:38.999 --> 23:39.999
It's ladies' night out
indeed, huh?

23:39.999 --> 23:40.999
- Yeah.

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
- I thought since you're
about to leave me,

23:42.999 --> 23:43.999
I should tease you a little bit.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
- I wish you could come with me.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
- Yeah, me too.
I got to work.

23:47.999 --> 23:50.999
How do you feel that this
might be your last free meal?

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
- This is not
my last free meal.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
Like, can we just honestly

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
just not talk
about this anymore?

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999
I've had enough sh**
from everyone.

23:59.999 --> 24:02.999
- I just hope it goes as well
as you think it is.

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
- I didn't rob a bank.

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
It's fine.
- Okay.

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
- It's fine.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
You know, I go through phases
where I'm kind of like,

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
"Ha ha, funny.
You know, I get it."

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
But it's really just not funny.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
Like, I'm tired of the jokes.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
I can't anymore.

24:16.999 --> 24:17.999
Tom and Katie are having

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
their engagement party
next week.

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
- I know. I'm excited.
- I'm excited too.

24:21.999 --> 24:24.999
I'm just--I just
don't know why, like--

24:26.999 --> 24:30.999
I'm just not fully on board
with marriage.

24:32.999 --> 24:34.999
I just--
- What do you mean?

24:34.999 --> 24:36.000
- Like, where--
I mean, getting married?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.999
They--like, they--
- Here's your owl shrimp.

24:37.999 --> 24:38.999
- Thank you so much.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
- What do you mean,
you're not fully on board

24:40.999 --> 24:41.999
with marriage?

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
- I don't understand
why you need that piece of paper

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
to tell somebody
that you love them.

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
Why can't you just
be together and be happy?

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
Why do you need
a piece of--

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
that piece of paper
ruins so much.

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
Who do you know
that's happily married?

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
- My grandparents,
your parents, Scheana and Shay.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.999
- Happy?
- Yes.

24:56.999 --> 24:57.999
- They almost got divorced,

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
like, six months
into their damn relationship.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
- And you know what?
They worked through it.

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
The way I'm raised
is that you get married,

25:03.999 --> 25:04.999
you have your family.

25:04.999 --> 25:05.999
Like, that's your family.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.000
That's what I want
for my future.

25:07.999 --> 25:09.999
I want a family.
These are my goals.

25:09.999 --> 25:10.999
Like, I want,
you know, a husband.

25:10.999 --> 25:13.999
I want kids.
I want all of that stuff.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
Your reputation
comes back around

25:15.999 --> 25:17.999
and back around and
back around, and I--

25:17.999 --> 25:19.999
- Come on; you know who I w--
you talked to the girls.

25:19.999 --> 25:20.999
- That's what I'm saying.
I do know it.

25:20.999 --> 25:22.999
- Okay, I've gone through some
sh**y-ass relationships too.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.999
- That's why I want to know

25:24.999 --> 25:25.999
that you would be
willing to be

25:26.000 --> 25:27.999
in a committed relationship
for a while

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
instead of having me
move up here

25:29.999 --> 25:32.999
and change my entire life
and then get thrown on my face.

25:34.999 --> 25:35.999
- Is this gonna be
an argument now?

25:35.999 --> 25:38.999
Like, are we gonna go home
and fight and everything?

25:38.999 --> 25:41.999
Like, this is--
our romantic dinner here

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
we're supposed to have is
turning out to be an argument.

25:43.999 --> 25:45.999
- It's kind of heartbreaking
if you love somebody

25:45.999 --> 25:47.999
and they say
those kind of things.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
- You can clearly
understand the frustration

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
that I have to go through
right now,

25:55.999 --> 25:57.999
what I have to deal with.

25:57.999 --> 25:58.999
You know, I told myself
with this relationship

25:58.999 --> 26:00.999
that I was not gonna move
too fast,

26:00.999 --> 26:03.999
so her moving in in a month

26:03.999 --> 26:04.999
and buying her boobs,

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
what the f***
am I doing with my life?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
I'm at a moment of crisis
right now with Brittany,

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
because I just feel like
there's times

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
where I feel like
I can't breathe.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
So I think just talking
about marriage right now

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
is just kind of, like--

26:16.999 --> 26:19.999
It's too much.

26:21.999 --> 26:22.999
Are you upset?

26:22.999 --> 26:23.999
- It's just hard to hear.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
- Are you crying?

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
- I'm just--

26:27.999 --> 26:30.999
If you actually love somebody,

26:30.999 --> 26:32.999
you should move forward
with your relationship.

26:36.999 --> 26:39.999
I lost my appetite.

26:41.999 --> 26:42.999
- Coming up...

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
- Have you ever seen
a bass guitar

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
that looks like this,
looks like that?

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
- Oh, Dildo Baggins!

26:47.999 --> 26:50.999
- I don't feel like
even bullets can stop us now.

26:59.999 --> 27:00.999
- You ready
to let off some steam?

27:00.999 --> 27:02.999
- Yeah, well...
- Let's hit some golf balls.

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
Right now, I need
a reach-around.

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
- What happened?
Why you steaming?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.999
- I got bombarded
on the marriage topic.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
I just took you to Hawaii.

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
I just bought you
some f***ing tits.

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
Calm down.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.999
- Hey, you're not good at golf.

27:15.999 --> 27:16.999
- Yes, I am.
That was straight.

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
- Dude, you know
what you're gonna get now?

27:18.999 --> 27:19.999
She's gonna be like, "Well,

27:19.999 --> 27:20.999
he doesn't want
to get married anyways."

27:21.000 --> 27:24.999
Like, little sarcastic,
snarky comments like that.

27:24.999 --> 27:25.999
- She's f***ing texting me.

27:25.999 --> 27:27.000
- Was it bad?
Did you--did you guys--

27:27.000 --> 27:29.999
- No, she started crying.
- Oh, no.

27:29.999 --> 27:32.999
He met Brittany, like,
what, a month ago?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
He had her move all the way
from Kentucky to L.A.

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
to live with him.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
He told her he loved her.

27:37.999 --> 27:39.999
I mean, he took her
on a nice trip to Hawaii.

27:39.999 --> 27:40.999
I mean, he bought her boobs.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
Now she has the nerve

27:42.999 --> 27:46.999
to bring up the possibility
of marriage someday?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
Come on, man.

27:48.999 --> 27:49.999
- What's going on with--
I haven't talked to Tom.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
- I'm actually going
to help Tom tonight

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
with his music video.

27:52.999 --> 27:53.999
- Oh, my God.

27:53.999 --> 27:54.999
- I'm just gonna be
a little muscle PA.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
- What a waste of time that is.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
I would rather talk
about religion or politics

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
or marriage at this point
than Tom's f***ing band.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.999
We've been down this path
before with Tom,

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
where he sinks all his money
into something

28:03.999 --> 28:06.999
and then he gives up
six months down the line.

28:06.999 --> 28:07.999
- I told Tom, I was like,
"Listen,

28:07.999 --> 28:09.999
I really like your song.
I like it a lot."

28:09.999 --> 28:10.999
I was like, "If you want,

28:10.999 --> 28:11.999
you can perform
at my engagement party."

28:11.999 --> 28:14.999
- Please tell me
he's not doing that. No.

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
- We secured Lisa's place

28:16.999 --> 28:18.000
for the engagement party,
Lisa's house.

28:18.999 --> 28:19.999
- Lisa's house?
- Villa Rosa.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.999
We got moats and sh**,
ponies at our engagement party.

28:22.999 --> 28:23.999
- Shut up!
- It's--we're doing it big.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
- Oh, that was a bad one.
- We got a caterer.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
- What? You paying
a lot of money for this?

28:26.999 --> 28:29.999
- Eh.
I want to say BYOB.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
But Katie said it's trashy.
I'm not kidding.

28:31.999 --> 28:34.999
- You don't say BYOB
to a f***ing catered party.

28:34.999 --> 28:36.999
- Yeah, it's not
a high school party.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
Some parents are out of town.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
So Katie went
and extended an invitation

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
to Stassi and Kristen.

28:41.999 --> 28:42.999
It's like, "You know,
I'd like for you guys to come

28:42.999 --> 28:43.999
to our engagement party."

28:43.999 --> 28:45.999
- Am I gonna finally see her?

28:45.999 --> 28:46.999
I haven't seen her
in God knows how long.

28:46.999 --> 28:47.999
Obviously, I'm nervous.

28:47.999 --> 28:50.999
Of course, I don't know
how she's gonna react.

28:50.999 --> 28:51.999
I really don't.

28:51.999 --> 28:52.999
I did go to Vegas

28:52.999 --> 28:54.999
and have relations
with somebody else.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
- You're an ass****.
You are an ass****.

28:56.999 --> 28:59.999
I think you're a liar,
and I don't trust you.

28:59.999 --> 29:00.999
- I'm super in love with you,

29:00.999 --> 29:02.999
so I don't know
how to deal with this.

29:02.999 --> 29:05.999
If you want me to move on, then
why are you crying a little?

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
I just don't want her
to hate me.

29:07.999 --> 29:09.999
It's been a long time,
and water's under the bridge.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
I feel like maybe now
we can come to a place

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
where we can be cordial.

29:13.999 --> 29:16.999
- Lisa got wind of it and put
the f***ing kibosh on it--

29:16.999 --> 29:17.999
no Kristen, no Stassi.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
- Wait, what?

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
- It's not awesome,
but it's kind of funny.

29:21.999 --> 29:22.999
- I'm really shocked

29:22.999 --> 29:23.999
that I haven't run
into her anytime sooner.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.999
- Brittany's probably
gonna be wary of that.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
Not like there's anything there.

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
It's been, what,
five years, four years?

29:28.999 --> 29:30.999
- Listen, Brittany
knows everything,

29:30.999 --> 29:31.999
and when I mean everything,
I--with this girlfriend,

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
I told her everything.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
- Like "f*** marriage"?
You leave that one out?

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
- That one,
I didn't--I left out.

29:49.999 --> 29:52.999
- Okay, here.
I have--

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
Count this and make sure
it's 2,100.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
- Okay.

30:00.999 --> 30:01.999
- It is?
- Yeah.

30:01.999 --> 30:04.999
- Not only do
I have more money invested

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
than I've ever invested
in anything in this video,

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
but it's also first image
of the band.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
Like, this sets the precedent

30:11.999 --> 30:14.999
for the rest of the band.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.999
I'm just, like, nervous.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
- Dude, dude, dude, dude,
you got actual craft services?

30:23.999 --> 30:24.999
- Yeah.
- I thought you were gonna have,

30:24.999 --> 30:26.999
like, a little sh**y table with,

30:26.999 --> 30:27.999
like, some, like,
you know, Oreos on it.

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
- No.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
- You got, like,
real craft service.

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
- He's waiting
for the high five.

30:31.999 --> 30:34.999
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm here to help Tom out.

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
He's not paying me,

30:35.999 --> 30:38.999
but then again, I'm not
really doing anything, so...

30:38.999 --> 30:40.999
- Isaac,
those literally should go on,

30:40.999 --> 30:43.000
like, right before
we literally start shooting.

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- Okay, roll camera.
Action.

30:46.999 --> 30:50.999
- It's a pretty fun
and sexy concept for a video.

30:50.999 --> 30:53.000
- ♪ She ain't got no selfies
on her 'Gram ♪

30:53.999 --> 30:54.999
- ♪ So hot, so hot ♪

30:54.999 --> 30:57.999
- ♪ Oh, so hot,

30:57.999 --> 31:00.999
♪ And all these faces
around me ♪

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
- That was f***ing cool.

31:01.999 --> 31:04.999
- Me and Isaac walk in
like mad scientists

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
with our liberation machine.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
- "All the faces around me."

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
I got to turn all the dials
and get this sh** going.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.999
- It helps people break through
the prisons of their own minds.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
- All right, cut.
That was f***ing awesome.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
- Most of the people
that we've casted in the video

31:17.999 --> 31:20.999
are all doing it for free.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
Faith and Lala are down
to dance in the background.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- Bust a move.
Bust a move.

31:24.999 --> 31:27.999
- Scheana might have seemed
like a very obvious choice.

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
One of the biggest reasons

31:28.999 --> 31:31.999
why I didn't ask her to be
in my music video

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
is because it is going
to be grueling.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
- Last one, guys.
Nail it.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
- The last thing I need
is somebody to show up

31:37.999 --> 31:40.999
wanting to talk about feelings
or any kind of conflict.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
I just--I can't afford it.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
- Could you teach me the dance
a little bit more?

31:44.999 --> 31:46.999
- Yeah.
- I just got to run through it.

31:46.999 --> 31:49.999
- Sandoval asked me if I wanted
to play a straight-laced girl

31:49.999 --> 31:53.999
unleashed by a sexual
liberation machine.

I'm kind of checking out
some Twitter stuff right now.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999

You guys, Wednesday.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999

- I'll finish--
we'll all get together.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
It'll be one big, happy family,
at least for the night.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.999
I don't know if it's still tense
between you and the girls

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
or what's going on with that.

32:33.999 --> 32:36.999
- I don't know. I don't talk--
I--they don't talk to me.

32:36.999 --> 32:37.999
- I don't like the dynamic
that's been emerging.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
It feels like you and Tom
have sort of just been,

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
like, ostracized
or I don't know, but anyways.

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
- Yeah, it has been
a little bit like that, but...

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
- Tom and Ariana
don't necessarily

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
do themself any favors,

32:47.999 --> 32:51.000
but I do think they're being
unfairly villainized

32:51.000 --> 32:52.999
and alienated.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
- Let me get
my wardrobe together.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.000
- Okay, cool.

32:55.999 --> 32:56.999
Well, if you need me,
I'll be on Twitter.

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
- Pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow.

33:00.999 --> 33:01.999
Love it, love it,
love it, love it.

33:01.999 --> 33:04.000
- Hey, guys,
I know you've seen bass guitars,

33:04.000 --> 33:05.999
but have you ever seen
a bass guitar

33:05.999 --> 33:07.999
that looks like this,
looks like that?

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
- Oh, Dildo Baggins!

33:09.999 --> 33:13.999
- The dildo bass guitar
is pretty out there.

33:13.999 --> 33:14.999
Careful they don't come off.

33:14.999 --> 33:15.999
- Guys, guys, guys,
careful with it.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.999
- Be careful.

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
But bring it on.
Bring me the dildos.

33:19.999 --> 33:20.999
I got this.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
- And action.

33:22.999 --> 33:23.999
- ♪ Let's change the distance ♪

33:24.000 --> 33:26.999
♪ Between you and me ♪

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
♪ I need your assistance ♪

33:35.999 --> 33:38.999
♪ I need you,
I need you ♪

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
♪ Let's touch in public ♪

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
- Cut!

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
That's a wrap.

33:43.999 --> 33:46.999
- It sucks that the venue
happens to be Casa de Lisa.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
- I don't want you to go in
guns blazing,

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
because I'm technically
your date.

34:11.999 --> 34:13.999
- Hello?
Hello.

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
Hey.

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
Hi, bubby.

34:27.999 --> 34:28.999
Where's your mommy?

34:28.999 --> 34:32.999
Wait, wait.
Dude, sh**.

34:32.999 --> 34:33.999
Dude. Come here.
Come here.

34:33.999 --> 34:35.999
Come here.
Sh**.

34:35.999 --> 34:36.999
Come here.

34:36.999 --> 34:39.999
Want to go back outside?

34:39.999 --> 34:41.999
Dude, dude.

34:41.999 --> 34:44.999
- Schwartzy, what are you doing?

34:44.999 --> 34:46.999
- I'm so sorry.
- What are you doing?

34:46.999 --> 34:47.999
Are you crazy?
Take them out.

34:47.999 --> 34:48.999
He's gonna do a big poop
on the thing.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
- Come on, bubby.
Oh, God.

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
I'm scared of horses.
Come on.

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
- Ken is gonna lose
his mind if he sees--

34:54.999 --> 34:57.999
- Come on.
It's okay.

34:57.999 --> 34:58.999
- Come on, Diamond.
- Come on, baby.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
- Move out of the way.
- Okay, sorry.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.999
- This is not putting me
in a good mood to do your party.

35:03.999 --> 35:04.999
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
- Diamond.

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
Why did you let them in
in the first place?

35:07.999 --> 35:08.999
- I don't know.
I turned my back for one second.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.999
They just ran in.
I'm so sorry.

35:10.999 --> 35:11.999
- They're horses.
- I know. I know.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
I didn't think
they would come inside.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
- I mean, what is he thinking?

35:15.999 --> 35:18.999
You don't leave
the barn door open.

35:18.999 --> 35:19.999
- It's gonna be great.

35:19.999 --> 35:21.999
We're doing, like,
a linen and lace theme.

35:21.999 --> 35:22.999
You don't have to, you know,

35:22.999 --> 35:23.999
abide by the theme
if you don't want to.

35:23.999 --> 35:24.999
- What do you mean, abide?

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
- I mean,
you don't have to dress

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
in accordance with the theme.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
You dress however
you want to dress.

35:28.999 --> 35:29.999
You're Lisa. I mean--
- Okay.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
- Yeah.
You--that goes without saying.

35:31.999 --> 35:32.999
And I wanted to make sure
it's okay

35:32.999 --> 35:34.000
that we come in a little early.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.999
Like, the caterer wants
to load in around 11:00.

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
Is that gonna be--
- Okay, somebody's here, yeah.

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
- Okay, cool.

35:38.999 --> 35:39.999
- What are you gonna do
food-wise?

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
- Food-wise,
we're gonna do a barbecue.

35:41.999 --> 35:42.999
- Okay, please
do not burn my house down.

35:42.999 --> 35:44.999
- No, no, no, it's--
we have professionals.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
- But remember
we agreed to do this

35:46.999 --> 35:47.999
because it's down there.

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
It's out of my face.

35:49.999 --> 35:50.999
- So--
- Yes.

35:50.999 --> 35:52.999
- Nobody in the house.
- Nobody in the house.

35:52.999 --> 35:53.999
- What if we have
to use the restroom?

35:53.999 --> 35:54.999
Are we gonna have, like,
an outhouse?

35:54.999 --> 35:56.999
Well, I got to ask Katie that.

35:56.999 --> 35:57.999
Putting together
an engagement party's

35:57.999 --> 35:58.999
a real pain in the ass,
you know?

35:58.999 --> 36:00.999
There's a lot of details.

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
Don't get me wrong;
I'm really excited,

36:01.999 --> 36:04.999
but it's kind of starting
to feel like a chore.

36:04.999 --> 36:05.999
Don't tell Katie I said that.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
- But remember,
the party's down there.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
- Okay.
- And, Schwartzy, listen.

36:09.999 --> 36:10.999
I do not want Kristen there.

36:10.999 --> 36:13.999
No Kristen. I do not need
Kristen Doute here.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
- Is that a hard no
on Stassi as well?

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
- Stassi hasn't been
in your lives

36:17.999 --> 36:19.999
for six months.

36:19.999 --> 36:20.999
- No, no, no, no, no.

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
- I do not want to deal
with Stassi or Kristen.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
Really, don't push me
on this, okay?

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- No! Yeah, I'm not gonna be
pushing on this.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
- I've got enough animals
to look after.

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
Yeah, okay.

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
- Hi.
- Hello.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
- Camron.
- Hi, Camron. Stassi.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

36:39.999 --> 36:40.999
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.999
- Aldo, Stassi,
nice to meet you.

36:42.999 --> 36:43.999
- Wow.
- Welcome to Versailles.

36:43.999 --> 36:45.999
- This is the place.

36:45.999 --> 36:47.999
- As much as I love being
Kristen's drinking buddy

36:47.999 --> 36:49.999
every day,
I feel like we're destined

36:49.999 --> 36:52.999
to become the next Golden Girls
at this rate.

36:52.999 --> 36:55.000
- Obviously, this is
the breathtaking view.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
I mean, honestly,
you cannot beat it.

36:57.999 --> 36:58.999
Major closet space.
We have--

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
- The closet space
is the biggest deal.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
- So we have this closet
right here, very spacious.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
- Okay.

37:04.999 --> 37:05.999
- Also you have
the nice vanity here.

37:05.999 --> 37:08.999
You know, put on your makeup.
- And how much is it?

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
- This is 2,250 for
a 12-month unfurnished lease.

37:11.999 --> 37:13.999
- I'd like to take
some photos, maybe.

37:13.999 --> 37:14.999
- Yeah.
- Since you never, ever do that.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.000
- I'll give you five minutes.
- Cool.

37:16.999 --> 37:17.999
- Thank you so much.
- Awesome, our pleasure.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
- It's really beautiful,
though. It really is.

37:19.999 --> 37:20.999
And the guys
are really, really nice.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
- I mean, I wish there was
more closet space.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
That's actually
a concern of mine.

37:24.999 --> 37:27.999
Maybe I could, like,
build a shoe rack.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
- Have you talked to the girls
since Brennan's?

37:29.999 --> 37:31.000
- I talked
to both of them, like,

37:31.999 --> 37:32.999
via text and stuff like that,

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
but I'm really glad
Katie and Schwartz showed up.

37:34.999 --> 37:36.999
- I had to miss
Scheana's rehearsal.

37:36.999 --> 37:39.999
I am not missing
Katie's engagement party.

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
Oh, Lisa.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.999
She's gonna need guards
at the gate of Villa Rosa.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.999
She's gonna need SEAL Team Six,

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
because there's no way in hell

37:46.999 --> 37:48.999
I am missing another major
life event of Katie's.

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
- We need to, like,
talk about,

37:50.999 --> 37:53.999
like, what our--
what our plan is.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.999
- It sucks that the venue
happens to be Casa de Lisa,

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
and yeah, is there
a possibility Lisa's

37:57.999 --> 37:59.999
gonna be like, "You're not
welcome at my home"?

37:59.999 --> 38:03.999
I would go if it was
a sh**y shack in Compton.

38:03.999 --> 38:04.999
- Of course.
I would prefer it.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
I missed the engagement.

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
I'm not gonna miss
the engagement party,

38:08.999 --> 38:09.999
but it sounds like I'm gonna

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
have to put with some sh**
from Lisa.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.999
Yeah, so this should be
our plan.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.999
We're gonna go in
and just go like,

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
"Thank you for having us here"

38:17.999 --> 38:20.999
and move on and go talk
to people we like.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
- And that like us.
- Yeah.

38:22.999 --> 38:23.999
- If she cares about Katie,
though,

38:23.999 --> 38:26.000
the way that she's claiming
that she does by, like,

38:26.000 --> 38:27.999
allowing her to have it
at her house,

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
then she'll be nice to us too,

38:29.999 --> 38:31.999
because it would be
really selfish of her

38:31.999 --> 38:32.999
to, like, give us sh**.

38:32.999 --> 38:33.999
- To make it about her.
- Exactly.

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
- To make it about,
like, "Oh, darling,

38:35.999 --> 38:36.999
I didn't even want you here."

38:36.999 --> 38:39.999
Like, "Oh, really?

38:39.999 --> 38:40.999
I brought my own vodka."

38:41.999 --> 38:43.999
Okay, I'm gonna apply for it.

38:43.999 --> 38:44.999
- Okay.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
- Okay.
All right, cool.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what's up?

38:59.999 --> 39:02.999
- What's going on?
- What up, man?

39:10.999 --> 39:12.999
- Nice to have, you know,
friends to talk to

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
when you're stressed out.

39:17.999 --> 39:18.999
- Jax, are you
working late tonight?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.999
- I'm actually getting off
a little early,

39:20.999 --> 39:23.999
'cause I have a flight
to Hawaii in the morning.

39:23.999 --> 39:24.999
- What's up, guys?

39:24.999 --> 39:26.999
- Even though
I know what's happening,

39:26.999 --> 39:27.999
I'm still kind of nervous.

39:27.999 --> 39:28.999
- You're going to court.
That's scary.

39:28.999 --> 39:29.999
- You have to, like,
appear in person?

39:29.999 --> 39:31.999
- Yeah, there's--
- And what do you have to--

39:31.999 --> 39:32.999
do you have to just say, like,

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
"Please don't send me
to prison?"

39:34.999 --> 39:35.999
- Don't make any jokes.
- I'm not making any jokes.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.999
- Keep a serious face.
- I know.

39:37.999 --> 39:39.999
- Wear a suit.
- I know.

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
- But I wouldn't walk in there
with the attitude--

39:41.999 --> 39:42.999
- I'm not gonna go
with a cocky attitude.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
I'm gonna be--
Oh, I know. I know.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
Trust me; I've been talking
about this for, like, a week.

39:46.999 --> 39:47.999
I know. I know.

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
- I just think sometimes
you downplay things.

39:49.999 --> 39:50.999
You're like,
"Oh, no, it's fine.

39:50.999 --> 39:52.999
I'm going to Hawaii
for a couple days. No big deal."

39:52.999 --> 39:54.999
Jax is being very nonchalant

39:54.999 --> 39:56.999
about this little Hawaii trip
he's going on.

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
No, dude, you have to appear
before a judge

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
on a felony charge.

40:01.999 --> 40:02.999
He could go to jail.

40:02.999 --> 40:06.999
Like, how are you acting
so casual about this?

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
- What if you're not back
by Wednesday?

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
- You're gonna miss
the awesome party.

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
- You guys are all invited.

40:11.999 --> 40:12.999
Ariana, I hope you don't
have to pretend

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
to have too much fun, but...

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Oh, look at you.
You're so clever.

40:16.999 --> 40:17.999
Brava.

40:19.999 --> 40:21.000
No, of course.
I wanted to come.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
I support you guys 100%.

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
- I hope I get back on time.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
- Coming up...
- Where's those glasses?

40:33.999 --> 40:34.999
- I think
they're over here, yeah.

40:34.999 --> 40:35.999
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
return them.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999
- Well, they might
break it like that.

40:37.999 --> 40:39.999
- I don't give a f***
if they break.

40:53.999 --> 40:54.999
- Okay, can we go?

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
Actually, where's
those glasses?

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
- I think
they're over here, yeah.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.999
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
return them.

41:03.999 --> 41:04.999
The root of all evil.

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
- Well, they might
break it like that.

41:06.999 --> 41:07.999
- I don't give a f***
if they break.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.999
- ♪ I was such a fool ♪

41:11.999 --> 41:12.999
- What's gonna happen exactly?

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
- I literally have
to go there, walk in,

41:14.999 --> 41:15.999
and say something, I guess.

41:15.999 --> 41:18.999
I'll literally be back tomorrow.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
- I wish I could go with you.

41:23.999 --> 41:24.999
- I know.

41:24.999 --> 41:27.999
Everyone's asking me if I'm
afraid to go to jail in Hawaii.

41:27.999 --> 41:30.999
Actually, the truth is, I feel
like I'm in jail right now

41:30.999 --> 41:31.999
here in my apartment.

41:34.999 --> 41:37.999
- ♪ You were everything ♪

41:39.999 --> 41:42.000
♪ And you said
you needed me ♪

41:47.999 --> 41:49.999
- What time is your court?

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
8:00 tomorrow morning.

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
This incident kind of made me
take a look around

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
and realize that maybe it's time

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
to slow things down
a little bit.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- Are you nervous?

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
- I'm just anxious, actually.

42:08.999 --> 42:09.999
I am human.
We make mistakes.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
But the bigger mistake

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
was letting my girlfriend
of three months

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
move in with me
in my studio apartment.

42:15.999 --> 42:17.999
I think I've officially
hit the point

42:17.999 --> 42:19.999
where living with Brittany
is too much.

42:19.999 --> 42:22.000
Eager to get this over with.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
- Next time
on the season finale

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
of "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:28.999 --> 42:30.999
- Lots and lots of stuff.
- We got booze, man.

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
- Hi.
- How you doing?

42:32.999 --> 42:35.999
- Hi.
- Uh-oh, I see trouble.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- When little T-Schwa

42:38.999 --> 42:41.999
got out of his Honda Civic
coming from Florida--

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
- Can we wrap it up?

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
- Don't say wrap it up.

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
- What the f***
are you talking about?

42:48.999 --> 42:51.999
- Yes!
- Whoo!

42:51.999 --> 42:52.999
- I'm this close.
I'm gonna hit him.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.000
- You think I'm f***ing
scared of Jax?

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
- You want to go?

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
I'm about 200 pounds heavier
than you. I'll f***ing go.

42:57.999 --> 42:58.999
- Don't curse at me
in front of Lisa.

42:58.999 --> 42:59.999
- Take a seat.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- You cannot get
in trouble for that.

43:01.999 --> 43:05.999
- I am the last person
that you want to f***ing push.

43:05.999 --> 43:06.999
- I'm really scared.

43:06.999 --> 43:07.999
- Sit the f*** down.

43:07.999 --> 43:08.999
- All right, all right!

43:08.999 --> 43:09.999
- Why are you back
all of a sudden?

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- Are you not paying
attention to what I'm saying?

43:11.999 --> 43:13.999
- I'm listening--stop
attacking me before I even talk.
