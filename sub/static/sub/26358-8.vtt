WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.267
COLE: At 0700 hours,
three Air Force officers

00:06.310 --> 00:07.790
took over two
launch control centers.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.226
So you're telling me
they have the capability

00:09.270 --> 00:10.836
to launch a nuclear missile.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.969
I'm telling you they can
launch 50nuclear missiles.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.536
Have you heard of
the Patton Project?

00:14.579 --> 00:17.495
Supposedly it's a military
within the military.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.019
Go! Go! Go!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.805
Aah!

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
[echoing, indistinct
announcement on P.A.]

00:50.354 --> 00:52.313
Hey.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.923
How you doing?

00:53.966 --> 00:56.578
Okay.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.841
Is everything the same?

01:00.495 --> 01:04.412
You asking me if I still want
to be dead? Yeah. Yeah.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.588
Way to get to the point.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.982
Have you, uh,

01:10.026 --> 01:11.549
told the doctors about it?

01:11.593 --> 01:13.769
Hell no.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.858
Good.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.079
It's your life

01:19.122 --> 01:21.733
to live or not.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.171
Remember...

01:26.173 --> 01:27.304
...there's no rule that says

01:27.348 --> 01:29.437
you have to endure pain.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.528
Yeah.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.531
You're right.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.101
What's my surprise?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.972
Same.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.060
Meth.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.803
Thank you.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.848
Mm-hmm.

01:51.328 --> 01:54.940
Uh, have you thought any more
about what we talked about?

01:55.985 --> 01:59.031
About taking the package
on the plane?

01:59.075 --> 02:02.165
Yes. Shh, shh, shh. Yeah.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.561
Go out with a bang?

02:06.604 --> 02:09.172
That'd show 'em.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.174
Yeah, it would.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.176
In a big way.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.136
Get everybody thinking a little
bit differently about you.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.360
I definitely want to do it.

02:25.623 --> 02:29.192
You know,

02:29.236 --> 02:32.195
bringing Michael along
would really help ensure

02:32.239 --> 02:34.284
you get the package on board.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.730
If I'm gone,

02:45.774 --> 02:48.472
the last thing I want is
my parents to have him.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.476
Or his scumbag father.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.698
Think about taking him.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.224
You do get priority boarding
with a baby.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.532
Yeah.

03:06.273 --> 03:09.972
If I'm gone, I don't want him
on this earth without me.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.152
You still getting out on Friday?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.199
Yup.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.896
Four more days,

03:20.939 --> 03:23.507
I'm a free woman.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.249
I'll be waiting.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.772
♪

03:53.189 --> 03:54.886
KENSI:
Okay, Kat, Mindy, Mandy,

03:54.930 --> 03:57.585
Tiffany and Tiffany and their
plus-ones are ten people.

03:57.628 --> 03:58.934
We only have
eight-people tables.

03:58.977 --> 03:59.978
I don't know what the... I mean,

04:00.022 --> 04:00.892
we're gonna have
to separate them.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.024
Okay.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.852
No, no, not
okay. No.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.201
It's like they're
one person.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.421
It's literally like
cutting off a limb for them.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.988
Well, that seems
like a slight exaggeration.Oh, gosh.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.077
And when did you do this?
When did you put Anna

04:12.121 --> 04:13.557
between your Uncle Bob
and Kip Brigham?

04:13.601 --> 04:15.733
What are you talking about?
Kip is recently divorced.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.300
So is Anna.
Weddings are romantic.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.302
Yes, romantic,
but Kip is player.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.304
Kip is a professional
basketball player

04:21.348 --> 04:23.828
who is thoughtful
and kind and heartbroken.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.569
Listen, I got
the whole thing planned out.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.005
Uncle Bob's gonna
get drunk, right?

04:27.049 --> 04:28.311
He's gonna tell sexist jokes

04:28.355 --> 04:29.834
and he's gonna drive Anna
right into Kip's arms.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.402
That sounds like a pack of
hyenas circling their prey.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.795
I am absolutely not
doing that to Anna.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.013
I'm gonna sit her
next to Monika.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.581
Okay.
But, just so you know,

04:37.625 --> 04:40.062
that if Anna and Kip
do get together,

04:40.105 --> 04:42.630
good chance Anna
will move out to Los Angeles.

04:42.673 --> 04:45.676
Just... putting it out there.

04:47.765 --> 04:50.377
Well... Kip is a
nice guy, right?

04:50.420 --> 04:52.640
So funny.He's handsome.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.250
Big.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.731
What

04:56.774 --> 04:58.907
What No.
I don't mean like that.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.517
Oh.This is an H.R. violation.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.866
This is very
uncomfortable.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.128
I feel uncomfortable.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.782
DEEKS:
Here comes Callen and Sam.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.654
KENSI:
Ah. Right on time.

05:07.698 --> 05:08.917
Hey, hey.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.048
What's up?

05:10.092 --> 05:12.660
Hola. What are we doing
in the boonies?

05:12.703 --> 05:15.750
Don't know. Ochoa told us
to meet a contact out here.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.535
Says we, uh, we're
being farmed out.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.797
To who?

05:19.841 --> 05:22.060
Wouldn't say.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.462
Hello.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.335
Nobody
remembers me?

05:35.378 --> 05:36.988
Tobin Shaked.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.382
Former Mossad.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.384
We helped out your daughter.No, you saved

05:41.428 --> 05:42.646
my daughter's life.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.518
I'm in your debt for that.

05:44.561 --> 05:47.347
Please,
come this way.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.439
Come in.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.834
This is all a little odd
for you, I'm sure.

05:56.878 --> 06:00.011
A little.
Did you call this meeting?

06:00.055 --> 06:01.970
I'm working for
a covert division

06:02.013 --> 06:03.711
of a United States agency now.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.016
That's a little
cryptic.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.062
DEEKS: My guess is
Department of Agriculture.

06:07.105 --> 06:10.282
SHAKED:
CIA, DIA, NSA, DHS--

06:10.326 --> 06:12.067
Ultimately, what does it matter?

06:12.110 --> 06:14.635
It matters because it'd be nice
to know who we're supporting.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.593
All I can tell you is
we are all working

06:16.637 --> 06:18.378
for the security
of the United States.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.249
So that's all
we're gonna get?

06:20.292 --> 06:22.817
SAM: How'd you go from
an Israeli ex-pat to...

06:22.860 --> 06:24.122
SHAKED: Someone who can get
the four of you to come to

06:24.166 --> 06:25.950
a random meeting in the
middle of Valencia?

06:25.994 --> 06:28.736
Yeah.Let's just say I have

06:28.779 --> 06:31.826
very specialized skills
your government needs.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.002
Hear me out.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.743
I think you'll understand why

06:35.786 --> 06:37.484
you are involved
in this operation.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.660
We're not involved
in anything yet.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.879
My understanding is that

06:41.923 --> 06:44.969
your participation
is not optional.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.057
How's that?

06:46.101 --> 06:48.886
Please.

06:50.018 --> 06:53.021
Last year your team
subverted an attack

06:53.064 --> 06:55.545
on a nuclear missile silo
by a group

06:55.589 --> 06:57.155
called the Patton Project.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.854
It's a right-wing group
within the military.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.117
Yeah, they advocate for extreme
force in the military.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.248
What they advocate is

07:03.292 --> 07:05.120
nuclear carpet-bombing
in the Middle East

07:05.163 --> 07:08.471
to begin a Muslim genocide.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.082
The men and women inside the
Patton Project potentially have

07:11.126 --> 07:13.476
access to all
of the U.S. military's

07:13.520 --> 07:15.043
weapons of mass destruction.

07:15.086 --> 07:18.002
Nuclear missiles,
submarines, bombers...

07:18.046 --> 07:21.092
The powers that be
are not just concerned.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.311
They are...Scared.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.574
Terrified.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.010
As should you be.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.012
What's our involvement?

07:28.056 --> 07:31.015
We have new intelligence
that could lead us to finding

07:31.059 --> 07:32.669
a member of the Patton Project.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.280
I need your help.What's the intel?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.283
A high-ranking member likes to
meet contacts in Venice Beach.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.503
That's it?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.679
Where do you
get this information?

07:44.246 --> 07:45.726
SHAKED:
I believe you all
know each other.

07:45.769 --> 07:49.294
Hey. 101 was a nightmare.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.470
Well, don't
worry about it.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.341
It's just
domestic terrorism.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.517
Oh, hey.
Remember me?

07:54.561 --> 07:55.997
I'm the guy
that saved your life.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.085
SHAKED:
Your friends were
just asking...

07:57.128 --> 07:58.260
Oh, we're friends now?

07:58.303 --> 08:00.131
I didn't say it.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.482
Your colleagues
were just asking

08:02.525 --> 08:04.396
where the intel
came from.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.833
All right, well,
it's my understanding

08:05.876 --> 08:07.922
that we lost contact
with the source of the intel,

08:07.965 --> 08:10.968
and now all we have
is... Venice Beach.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.318
We have
a list.

08:13.362 --> 08:17.322
105 potential suspects.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.760
They are all either current
or former military who,

08:19.803 --> 08:22.937
because of their background,
political affiliations

08:22.980 --> 08:25.026
or intercepted communications,

08:25.069 --> 08:27.202
could be part
of the Patton Project.

08:27.245 --> 08:30.248
I have service photos,
military files,

08:30.292 --> 08:32.424
intelligence on why
they're on this list.

08:32.468 --> 08:34.383
If we're staking out
Venice Beach,

08:34.426 --> 08:35.819
why not just use facial rec?

08:35.863 --> 08:38.300
We'll use both.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.171
The suspect could change their
pattern at the last minute.

08:40.215 --> 08:43.000
We can't wait for computers.
We must be proactive.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.960
Last time the consequences
could have been catastrophic.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.006
It's a priority,
to say the least.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.139
SHAKED:
Take the day.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.228
Digest the
information.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.925
Try to memorize
the faces.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.101
Then we begin.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.408
We'll get back to you.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.193
I'm sure you will.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.028
What did you find out
about Shaked?

09:11.072 --> 09:13.596
Well, whoever he's working for
now has him buried deep.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.859
According to airline
and immigration records,

09:15.903 --> 09:18.688
he's currently
somewhere in Poland.Meaning

09:18.732 --> 09:21.561
what, exactly?He's a ghost.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.040
Doesn't exist
inside the U.S.

09:23.084 --> 09:26.000
Well, that is some serious
Secret Squirrel stuff.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.131
What was Shaked
doing for the Mossad

09:27.175 --> 09:28.437
before he came to the U.S.?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.787
That's where it gets
really interesting.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.963
Shaked was part of an elite
team responsible for nearly

09:33.007 --> 09:35.139
two dozen assassinations.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.967
ERIC:
Wet work in Iran, Gaza,

09:37.011 --> 09:38.665
West Bank, Syria.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.668
And now, most likely,
the United States.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.845
So we're being forced to work
with an assassination team?

09:44.888 --> 09:47.325
Looks that way.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.995
He has clearance
to be here now?

10:05.039 --> 10:06.518
Well, he did save your life.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.912
Not gonna let us
forget that?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.610
No, I'm not.
Are you?

10:10.653 --> 10:12.133
Uh, not for a long time.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.788
Why did they come to us?

10:14.831 --> 10:17.225
All I know is that SecNav

10:17.268 --> 10:19.009
asked that we meet with Shaked.

10:19.053 --> 10:21.446
You knew him, and the op was

10:21.490 --> 10:22.926
part of the
continued investigation

10:22.970 --> 10:24.972
into the
Patton Project.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.235
There was no discussion
on what type of op it was?

10:27.278 --> 10:29.498
I think it's pretty
self-explanatory.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.195
Yeah, they just
left out the part

10:31.239 --> 10:32.675
where Shaked is an assassin.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.155
Making us part of that.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.548
Nobody's asked you
to execute a target, correct?

10:36.592 --> 10:38.159
They don't have to.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.335
They asked our help
in locating the target.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.553
That makes us complicit.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.207
And that is not
what we do.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.167
Well, what happened in Mexico
says different.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.691
You went outside

10:48.735 --> 10:51.520
the lines.
It was noticed.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.566
So now there's a perception that
we're good for this type of op?

10:54.610 --> 10:55.742
Seems like it.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.658
Trouble is...

10:58.701 --> 11:00.703
they're not wrong.

11:02.313 --> 11:05.969
Next. Next. Got it.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.232
Next. Got it.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.712
Yeah, no.
You don't... No.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.148
This is gonna be
impossible to memorize

11:11.192 --> 11:12.149
all these faces in one day.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.412
And plus,
this is not your forte.

11:14.456 --> 11:15.718
What are you talking about?

11:15.762 --> 11:18.590
I'm talking about that
you are facially challenged.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.244
I am not facially ch...
I'm great with faces.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.681
I am a face savant.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.073
Really? Okay.
Well, let's do this.Yeah.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.379
How about thatOkay.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.468
Well, I'm not trying
to recognize their names,

11:26.511 --> 11:27.774
I'm just trying to
recognize their faces.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.079
No, that's fine.
Do you know this person?

11:29.123 --> 11:30.298
No, I do not
know this person.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.691
That is my Uncle Jimmy.That is what?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.214
KENSI:
We had a dinner together.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.432
He's coming to our wedding.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.173
Oh. Well, that's
a trick question.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.740
That's not really fair.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.700
Okay. What about this?

11:40.743 --> 11:44.094
So what, now we're playing
"terrorist or relative"?

11:44.138 --> 11:45.966
Shouldn't be that difficult
of a distinction, and plus,

11:46.009 --> 11:47.619
these people are about
to become your relatives,

11:47.663 --> 11:49.099
so get to know them.

11:49.143 --> 11:53.060
Yeah, I'm super excited
about this extended family.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.149
What

11:55.192 --> 11:57.673
I need a clue.
Give me a clue.Okay, this is my...

11:57.717 --> 11:59.240
Your...

11:59.283 --> 12:01.546
Cousin...cousin... Adam.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.852
Michael.
Went surfing together.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.897
Went to the Hollywood Bowl.

12:03.940 --> 12:04.941
Saw Randy Travis.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.377
David Hasselhoff,
one night only.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.422
He's coming
to the wedding, is he?

12:07.465 --> 12:08.771
Yeah.Hmm.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.251
Well, I don't know
how to break this to you,

12:10.294 --> 12:11.905
but your cousin
looks like a terrorist.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.907
That beard?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.996
Well, that's awkward.Well, he's awkward.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.086
What'd you find?

12:19.129 --> 12:21.653
I dug deeper into the
file that contained the photos.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.787
Over the last few months,
faces were added to the file.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.876
It makes sense.
As they discovered new suspects,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.269
they were added.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.053
One face, however,
was removed.

12:30.097 --> 12:33.143
Well, Shaked or someone must
have cleared him as a suspect.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.971
That's what we thought,
but when we looked

12:35.015 --> 12:36.843
into the military file
of that person--

12:36.886 --> 12:39.846
Marine First Sergeant
Dean White-- he's...

12:39.889 --> 12:40.977
He's dead.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.239
You stole my reveal.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.807
I thought it was our
reveal.Well...

12:44.851 --> 12:46.940
I did all the setup.How'd he die?

12:46.983 --> 12:48.115
My turn?Go ahead.

12:48.158 --> 12:51.031
Okay.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.076
When we looked into
the cause of death,

12:53.120 --> 12:54.948
it was...NELL: It was redacted.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.166
TURK:
Redacted. Did he have

12:56.210 --> 12:57.820
some sort of
special security clearance?

12:57.864 --> 12:58.952
ERIC:
No.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.649
Uh, White's body
was taken to the office

13:00.692 --> 13:02.564
of Medical Examiner Amy Shuler.

13:02.607 --> 13:03.913
CALLEN:
We know her.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.872
ERIC:
Yeah. You interviewed
her a few years ago.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.743
Uh, she is in charge for--
wait for it...

13:07.787 --> 13:10.267
The classified autopsies
of the military, CIA.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.703
Stole your reveal.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.401
Sorry about that.

13:13.444 --> 13:14.794
We should have a
conversation with her.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.187
I'll stay here,
drill down on Shaked.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.841
I got shotgun if you want.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.931
Yeah, okay.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.846
Address is on your phones.Address is on...
you got to be kidding me.

13:23.890 --> 13:27.197
Guys. It's not
a competition.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.463
Let's talk in here.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.380
You have something
you want to show us?

13:36.424 --> 13:38.165
No.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.080
Why are we in with the bodies?

13:40.123 --> 13:42.038
This room is secure.

13:42.082 --> 13:46.129
Swept for listening devices,
shielded against surveillance.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.914
My office and the hallways
are not.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.090
You afraid of something?

13:50.133 --> 13:53.920
I take my security clearance
very seriously.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.051
I shouldn't be speaking to you.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.966
But you are.

13:57.010 --> 14:00.665
First Sergeant Dean White's
postmortem medical exam

14:00.709 --> 14:02.145
came from black division.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.277
Which division?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.191
You don't have
to know that right now.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.583
Well, are you afraid of them?

14:05.627 --> 14:08.935
Of course.
And you should be, too.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.937
Then why are you talking to us?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.765
Let's just say what I saw
hasn't sat well with me.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.943
Look, we've been asked to work
with some people.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.032
We'd like to know what
we're getting involved in.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.035
After 9/11, I did work

14:22.078 --> 14:24.907
for some of the black sites
in Europe, Abu Ghraib...

14:24.951 --> 14:27.344
Classified autopsies
of suspected terrorists.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.998
It's what I do.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.957
What I saw when I examined
First Sergeant White

14:31.000 --> 14:33.176
looked exactly
like some of those bodies.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.178
Which was?

14:35.222 --> 14:37.659
If this ever gets out,
I'll deny we ever spoke.

14:37.702 --> 14:38.660
Understood.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.576
With a hundred percent
certainty,

14:41.619 --> 14:44.231
I can tell you
White was waterboarded.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.972
The stress
on his pulmonary system

14:46.015 --> 14:48.365
caused a cardiac arrest
that led to his death.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.239
Did he have a heart condition?

14:52.282 --> 14:55.242
No. Look, guys,
you can dance around it,

14:55.285 --> 14:57.331
call it "enhanced
interrogation."

14:57.374 --> 14:58.201
Plain English...

14:58.245 --> 15:00.160
White was tortured to death.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.857
Yes.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.264
Secure the room.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.482
Okay.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.141
Okay, so First Sergeant White
was part

15:25.185 --> 15:28.449
of several extreme right wing
political organizations.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.973
He also spouted some pretty vile
anti-Islamic rhetoric

15:31.017 --> 15:32.714
in various chat rooms.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.107
That makes sense
why Shaked would target him

15:34.150 --> 15:35.978
as a potential member
of the Patton Project.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.937
I'm sorry, didn't Eric
say that White was taken

15:37.980 --> 15:39.155
off the list because he died?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.027
That's not the whole story.

15:41.070 --> 15:44.508
We spoke to the M.E. who did
the postmortem exam on White,

15:44.552 --> 15:46.206
and we believe

15:46.249 --> 15:49.992
that either Shaked
or his people interrogated him.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.473
And then, during the
interrogation, he died.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.519
I'm sorry, what?

15:55.563 --> 15:57.478
He was waterboarded,

15:57.521 --> 15:58.914
which led to a
heart attack.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.916
So Shaked is an assassin

16:00.960 --> 16:03.266
who killed men
during interrogation.

16:03.310 --> 16:06.661
Under whose
authorization?

16:06.704 --> 16:08.619
You spoke to him first.

16:09.881 --> 16:13.842
To answer your question,
uh, it could be any agency.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.845
And I think I was
brought in to...

16:16.888 --> 16:18.586
provide a friendly face,

16:18.629 --> 16:19.979
put everybody at ease.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.024
DEEKS:
Well, I'm sure

16:22.068 --> 16:24.070
that's working.
Why us?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.593
Ochoa thinks
that because of Mexico,

16:25.636 --> 16:27.899
we have gained
a certain reputation.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.467
Okay, so get us off it.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.034
No, no. Wait a minute.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.906
The Patton Project attempted
what I consider to be one

16:34.950 --> 16:37.909
of the most dangerous terrorist
attacks on the United States.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.477
They advocate genocide
of Muslims worldwide.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.871
I understand that, and there's
a-a lot of terrible groups

16:42.914 --> 16:44.699
that advocate genocide,
but don't we toss

16:44.742 --> 16:47.397
the Constitution
and our morality out the window.

16:47.441 --> 16:50.400
No. Last time, the Patton
Project almost accomplished it.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.054
They are not a powerless group.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.927
Then we have to ask ourselves...

16:55.971 --> 16:58.321
are we people who do this?

16:58.365 --> 17:01.933
We back away,
they'll find someone else.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.545
Well, then, maybe it's
the right thing to do.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.069
And-and we're the ones
to determine that?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.245
I mean, just to remind you all,

17:09.289 --> 17:11.421
w-we don't make the laws,
we enforce them.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.381
And as this plays out, we are
becoming the judge, the jury...

17:14.424 --> 17:16.035
And executioner.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.039
I need to speak to Ochoa.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.001
Deputy Director.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.134
You getting a workout in?Yeah, all done.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.571
Heading out.
What's going on?

17:31.963 --> 17:33.400
I need some information
if we're gonna

17:33.443 --> 17:35.619
continue with this operation.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.969
I don't have much.

17:39.667 --> 17:43.366
I believe that Shaked's op,
simply put,

17:43.410 --> 17:46.978
is to find members of the Patton
Project and have them executed.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.024
Is that what this is?

17:52.027 --> 17:53.159
Off the record?

17:53.202 --> 17:54.638
Yeah.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.814
Do you have a recording device
on your person,

17:56.858 --> 17:59.078
or are you aware of this
conversation being recording?

18:00.209 --> 18:01.471
That's where this is going?

18:01.515 --> 18:03.169
I'm from Washington.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.127

18:06.998 --> 18:08.391
I'm not trying to trap anyone,

18:08.435 --> 18:11.133
I'm trying to understand
my team's involvement.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.136
Okay.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.313
You have an accurate assessment
of the situation.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.924
So you knew what this was?

18:19.968 --> 18:22.492
Obliquely.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.015
Things like this
aren't exactly spelled out

18:24.059 --> 18:25.756
unless they
absolutely have to be.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.150
We went to Mexico
to save a child.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.370
This is completely different.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.242
This-this is...
this is contract killing.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.505
Maybe it's the price

18:35.549 --> 18:37.942
of having gotten out of
the consequences of Mexico.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.510
No.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.599
We never made that deal
with anybody.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.254
Maybe Hetty did, or Kilbride.
I mean, think about it.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.908
You've got a good team

18:46.951 --> 18:48.823
who's willing to operate
in the gray zone.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.782
This isn't gray.
This is black.

18:51.826 --> 18:55.395
Either way,
they can shut you down or...

18:55.438 --> 18:57.005
Or they can use us.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.050
Exactly.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.400

20:40.326 --> 20:42.893
KENSI:
Guys, he's about
to get on his motorcycle.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.548
SHAKED:
Do not let him get on that bike.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.208
Get out of here.
Go, go, go!

20:59.388 --> 21:00.824
I lost him.

21:00.868 --> 21:01.912
Got the contact.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.914
MAN:
Whoa, man!

21:05.351 --> 21:07.048
All right, Kensi,
we're stuck in traffic.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.223
Put out a BOLO out on Lawford

21:08.267 --> 21:10.051
and a description
of the motorcycle.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.106
I got him going
into the building

21:22.150 --> 21:23.499
on the corner of
Pacific and Market.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.287
That's a block up.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.512
Sorry.Whoa, whoa.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.264
I'll take the back.The building's secure.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.309
He's not going anywhere.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.834
SHAKED:
Clear the floor.
We'll take the roof.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.879
On your right,
your right.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.322
Go, go.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.323
Got him.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.628
Show me your hands.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.238
Now!

22:07.282 --> 22:08.196
Show me your hands!

22:08.239 --> 22:09.415
Nowhere to run.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.635
Hands on
your head.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.118
SHAKED:
We said hands on your head.

22:18.598 --> 22:19.947
G, anything?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.341
I got nothing.

22:50.978 --> 22:51.848
Where is he?

23:08.996 --> 23:10.432
We're good.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.913
No traffic camera footage
where we can be identified.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.828
I grabbed the building's
security drive

23:14.871 --> 23:16.395
before the LAPD
showed up.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.613
Wait a minute, so that's
how this works--

23:17.657 --> 23:19.093
we get away with murder
and we're good?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.269
No-Nobody's
been murdered.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.879
He jumped off that roof.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.141
He just ran off the edge?

23:24.185 --> 23:25.882
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.841
Why would he do that?I don't know, but it's

23:27.884 --> 23:29.582
the truth, Callen.Are you working with him?

23:29.625 --> 23:32.193
Are you asking me if I
threw that man off the roof?

23:32.236 --> 23:33.586
Well, if she's not, I am.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.152
Why did Shaked go to you first?

23:35.196 --> 23:36.458
SAM:
Maybe you guys are the ones

23:36.502 --> 23:38.025
who suggested
us for this op.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.983
You know something?
It doesn't matter. We're done.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.463
Find yourself
another team.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.944
We just located our target
and you're backing out?

23:43.987 --> 23:45.336
Hey, we've got this guy.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.034
Look.

23:47.077 --> 23:48.862
Retired Army colonel
Trevor Lawford.

23:48.905 --> 23:51.430
Lives in Orange County.
There's nowhere for him to hide.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.779
So we're gonna execute
a guy with his wife

23:52.822 --> 23:55.172
and his two kids?
No, man. I'm out.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.391
So what the
Patton Project does

23:56.435 --> 23:58.698
from here on out,
it's on your heads.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.180
ERIC:
Hey, I got the name of the man

24:03.224 --> 24:04.878
who fell from the building.
Brad Kelby.

24:04.921 --> 24:05.966
He lived in Echo Park.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.533
Is he former
military?

24:07.576 --> 24:10.013
Uh, no.
No military experience at all.

24:10.057 --> 24:13.103
He spent the last year in
Metropolitan State Hospital.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.017
He was sick?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.802
No, it's a psychiatric hospital.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.499
Kelby's been living
with his sister since then.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.022
Send us the address.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.086
Come on.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.784
That's right,
it's okay.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.352
Here you go.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.571
Hi, pumpkin.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.968
Okay.

24:57.278 --> 24:59.106
Okay.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.724
I can't back out.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.987
These are bad guys
that need to be stopped.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.467
LAPD's finishing up.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.947
We tell Ochoa
we're out.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.166
Then we take over the
investigation ourselves.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.908
We find Lawford first,
we'll put him in the system.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.780
Make Shaked irrelevant.

25:20.823 --> 25:24.435
Question Lawford ourselves.

25:24.479 --> 25:28.222
Homicide detectives are gone.
Let's go.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.531
Excuse me, miss?

25:32.574 --> 25:35.925
NCIS. Can we ask you
a few questions?

25:35.969 --> 25:36.970
Sure.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.978
My brother had only been
out of the hospital three weeks.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.849
He battled depression
his whole life.

25:46.893 --> 25:50.287
He was getting
really paranoid and dark.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.725
Did he ever mention
the name Lawford?

25:52.768 --> 25:54.683
No.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.293
Any new friends?

25:56.337 --> 25:58.513
He did meet a man named Tyler,

25:58.557 --> 26:00.994
who I didn't think
was a good influence.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.212
Why's that?

26:02.256 --> 26:05.607
Brad tried
to kill himself twice.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.566
Serious attempts.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.219
One day he told me
his friend Tyler

26:09.263 --> 26:11.874
thought that suicide
was a sane act.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.921
Did he still want
to kill himself?

26:14.964 --> 26:16.923
More than ever.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.403
Only now he wanted it
to be glorious.

26:20.448 --> 26:21.536
Something that would
get the world

26:21.580 --> 26:23.407
to remember him.

26:33.461 --> 26:34.897
So you think
that Trevor Lawford

26:34.941 --> 26:36.943
was trying to convince
Brad Kelby to kill himself

26:36.986 --> 26:38.161
in some sort of
act of terrorism?

26:38.205 --> 26:40.990
Same tactic as ISIS.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.339
They prey
on the mentally ill.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.038
So Kelby might have
actually jumped off the roof?

26:45.081 --> 26:47.562
Well, it makes sense. You know,
he was gonna himself anyway.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.086
At this point, the only thing
left for him was jail time.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.785
Uh, question is
what was his op?

26:52.828 --> 26:55.396
Shaked would say
what difference does it make

26:55.439 --> 26:56.440
if we kill Lawford?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.573
It's not a bad argument.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.576
It means I'm gonna
have to apologize to Turk.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.840
Well, he did save your life.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.930
You need to see this.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.762
We've been tracking
Lawford's movements

27:13.806 --> 27:15.590
for the last few months
using Kaleidoscope.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.722
He's been
travelling around

27:16.765 --> 27:18.637
to psychiatric hospitals
in California,

27:18.680 --> 27:20.551
Arizona and Nevada.How many?

27:20.595 --> 27:22.423
53 and counting.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.730
Ooh.DEEKS: That means Lawford
was targeting other patients.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.601
CALLEN:
These are people with mental
illness. He'd have to work

27:26.645 --> 27:28.690
with a critical mass
if he was gonna find a couple

27:28.734 --> 27:30.083
who were willing and able
to complete the mission.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.998
Okay, so Kelby was
not working on his own.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.695
Lawford has to have
another op in play.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.741
That's even more reason
for us to apprehend him

27:35.784 --> 27:37.525
and not let Shaked
take him out.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.222
Hey, I just found
Lawford's bike.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.050
It's parked outside
a motel in Cerritos.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.879
Let's go.Should we tell Ochoa?

27:43.923 --> 27:46.186
No, he'll
tell Shaked.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.014
We need
Lawford alive.

27:48.057 --> 27:50.364
They wanted black,
that's what they're gonna get.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.192
This is our op now.

27:53.584 --> 27:54.890
Okay.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.854
NCIS.
Take a look.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.420
What room is this man in?

28:04.770 --> 28:05.988
Thanks.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.441
CALLEN: Put your hands up!Move, get up, you...

28:24.485 --> 28:27.314
Get away from the computer.
Turn around, hands on the wall!

28:27.357 --> 28:29.359
Turn around.He's erasing the hard drive.

28:29.403 --> 28:30.491
Pull out the battery.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.327
Let's go.

28:50.641 --> 28:53.644
Don't even think about it,
with my team down there.

29:09.704 --> 29:10.836
You work for the Navy,

29:10.879 --> 29:13.142
but you don't really
support our troops.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.927
Or even our citizens.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.319
Hmm.

29:16.363 --> 29:17.712
Is that part of
the philosophy

29:17.756 --> 29:19.845
of the Patton Project?

29:19.888 --> 29:22.021
Patton Project?

29:22.064 --> 29:23.457
I don't know what that is.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.633
It's a group
that advocates using

29:25.676 --> 29:28.549
overwhelming military force
on Muslim nations.

29:28.592 --> 29:31.987
Really just a bunch of
fancy words for genocide.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.989
Interesting.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.425
Would solve a lot of problems.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.340
CALLEN:
And you have no problems...

29:37.384 --> 29:38.602
Deputy Director.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.908
Well, I guess
our secret hideout

29:39.952 --> 29:40.996
isn't that secret anymore

29:41.040 --> 29:42.432
if you keep letting
in the riffraff.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.912
This is Shaked's op.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.044
He should have
been notified

29:45.087 --> 29:46.523
when you took
Lawford into custody.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.656
It was no secret that Lawford
was put into the system.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.136
There was complete transparency.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.399
Too much transparency.
I need to speak with him.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.966
Well, Sam and Callen
are interrogating him

29:54.009 --> 29:55.141
right now, but
I'm sure there's

29:55.184 --> 29:57.012
a sign
Yeah.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.753
somewhere if you
want to just...

29:58.797 --> 30:00.059
Okay. Good talk.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.063
Hello, gentlemen.
Please, clear the room.

30:07.718 --> 30:10.896
Excuse me?Should I have your
deputy director ask you?

30:10.939 --> 30:12.636
He's just outside the door.

30:22.342 --> 30:25.606
Colonel Lawford, because
of your involvement

30:25.649 --> 30:27.869
with the Patton Project...I'm not involved.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.916
and your involvement with
the attempted takeover

30:30.959 --> 30:33.440
of the nuclear missile
silo in Colorado,

30:33.483 --> 30:35.311
you're going to be
charged with treason.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.009
That's absurd.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.272
Your computer didn't completely
erase your hard drive.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.751
We have your phone.
I'm sure we find

30:40.795 --> 30:43.624
your plane trips to Colorado.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.192
I just need the names of
the other members of the group.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.242
I'm proud

30:53.286 --> 30:55.941
to give my life for my country.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.681
Mm-hmm.

30:57.725 --> 31:01.120
Uh, I wonder if your wife--

31:01.163 --> 31:02.991
she will also be proud

31:03.035 --> 31:05.472
to give her life
for her country?

31:07.474 --> 31:08.910
WOMAN:
Why did Colorado fail?

31:08.954 --> 31:10.912
LAWFORD:
We believe it took too long.

31:10.956 --> 31:14.002
They should've redirected
just one missile

31:14.046 --> 31:15.786
and launched it immediately.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.049
WOMAN:
That's so disappointing.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.877
After all the work we put in.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.271
She had nothing to do with this.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.056
You created that recording.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.580
I have another recording

31:26.623 --> 31:29.452
of your daughter, 17 years old.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.194
They both go
to jail forever.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.896
I need the names of the
other members of the group.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.161
You have five minutes.

31:42.204 --> 31:45.164
I have your wife,
your daughter arrested.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.957
CALLEN:
Lawford's smart.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.220
He knows that that recording
won't hold up in court

31:58.264 --> 32:00.048
once it's technically
analyzed.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.223
My techs assure me
it will.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.311
Excuse me?

32:02.355 --> 32:04.096
It will stand up in court.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.227
They've been working
on the technology

32:05.271 --> 32:06.533
for a while.
It's good.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.143
So you're gonna
charge his wife and daughter

32:08.187 --> 32:09.971
even though you know
the phone call was fabricated?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.886
Once it gets real,
they may flip on him.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.322
But what if they don't
know anything about this?

32:13.366 --> 32:14.758
We tell them what to say.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.936
Really? You just force them
to commit perjury?

32:17.979 --> 32:20.068
Or we let Lawford hear a verdict

32:20.112 --> 32:23.158
and watch his wife and daughter
walk into a supermax.

32:23.202 --> 32:25.117
Even if they're
innocent?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.466
Oh, you wouldn't do the same?

32:26.509 --> 32:28.381
I mean, we use that tactic
to get information.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.209
We don't put innocent
people in prison.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.080
Even if it means saving
hundreds, if not thousands,

32:32.124 --> 32:33.603
of American lives?

32:33.647 --> 32:34.996
Let's stay focused.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.216
Lawford's recruited
possibly dozens

32:37.259 --> 32:39.609
of mentally-ill patients
for suicide missions,

32:39.653 --> 32:40.567
but we've got no idea

32:40.610 --> 32:41.829
what kind of missions.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.353
Shootings, explosives,
biological weapons.

32:44.397 --> 32:47.182
And we have no idea if any
of them are currently in play.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.141
ERIC:
We may be able
to help with that.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.882
Uh, using the GPS
in Lawford's phone and car,

32:51.926 --> 32:53.580
we were able
to track his movements,

32:53.623 --> 32:55.582
and, uh,
noticed a lot of trips

32:55.625 --> 32:57.627
to Hollywood Burbank Airport.

32:57.671 --> 33:01.631
We scanned airport cameras
and found that Lawford

33:01.675 --> 33:04.547
was booking a lot of flights
on various airlines.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.723
He'd then move
back and forth through security

33:06.767 --> 33:07.986
several times in a day.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.378
We think he was
trying to look for a gap

33:09.422 --> 33:10.597
in the system.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.512
Now, he seems
always to refuse the, uh,

33:12.555 --> 33:15.428
full-body scanners and opt
instead for the pat down.

33:15.471 --> 33:18.083
Think he's trying
to figure out which TSA agents

33:18.126 --> 33:20.824
are the most lax
or easily distracted.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.304
Well, even with
a lax TSA agent,

33:22.348 --> 33:23.871
you're still not gonna
get a gun through.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.307
Well, or blades.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.570
I mean, you'd have to be trained
in fighting with knives.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.485
It's probably
some kind of explosive.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.661
Or it's biological.

33:31.705 --> 33:34.142
'Cause a plane is a great way
to spread a pathogen.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.970
He's the only one
with the answers.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.584
Well, it's a good
thing he's not dead.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.156
WOMAN :
Welcome to Burbank Airport.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.158
AGENT: Next.

33:50.202 --> 33:52.204
[P.A. announcement continuing
indistinctly]

33:55.076 --> 33:56.947
Uh, excuse me,

33:56.991 --> 33:59.472
I don't want to go through
the machine with my baby.

33:59.515 --> 34:00.821
All right.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.086
Okay.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.132
Come this way.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.656
Got a pat down. I'll do it.MAN: All right. Okay.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.961
Just a second.
Here.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.964
Whee! Oh.

34:14.008 --> 34:15.792
MAN:
If you could step out.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.794
WOMAN:
Thank you..

34:20.101 --> 34:21.494
You're good.Okay.

34:21.537 --> 34:23.931
AGENT:
Arms up.

34:23.974 --> 34:26.194
Thank you, sir.

34:30.590 --> 34:31.982
Palms up.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.208
Thanks for that.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.348
Nitromethane.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.001
That's one part
of a binary explosive.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.220
And he's handled
it recently.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.874
Means this is
about to go down.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.354
We need to get
him to talk.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.399
If you clear this building,
I can do that very quickly.

34:57.443 --> 35:00.359
Deputy Director, he could've

35:00.402 --> 35:02.926
placed a bomb
on a plane as we speak.Don't do it.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.798
Let us work on him first.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.017
Something's bothering me.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.367
Let me talk to this guy.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.585
Give me two minutes.

35:09.629 --> 35:10.804
Take your shot.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.901
So, just speaking
hypothetically,

35:20.944 --> 35:22.772
you think wiping out
all the Muslim nations

35:22.816 --> 35:24.339
would be a good thing?

35:24.383 --> 35:27.386
Of course.
Wouldn't you agree?

35:27.429 --> 35:28.996
I'm Muslim.

35:29.039 --> 35:31.129
So, no, I wouldn't agree.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.957
Should've guessed.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.223
This racism thing's really
working out for you, huh?

35:38.266 --> 35:40.268
You call it racism.

35:41.965 --> 35:45.143
I call it realistic.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.929
Pragmatic.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.453
You get a lot of blue-eyed,
blonde Muslims?

35:51.497 --> 35:54.021
Plenty.Huh.

35:56.066 --> 35:59.940
Look...

35:59.983 --> 36:01.463
the world would be a different,

36:01.507 --> 36:05.032
much safer place without Islam.

36:05.075 --> 36:08.775
We just need
the reason

36:08.818 --> 36:10.777
to unleash the might

36:10.820 --> 36:13.997
and the power
that God has given to us.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.312
SAM:
Okay.

36:24.356 --> 36:27.054
So, Patton Project wants to
provoke a war between the U.S.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.098
and Muslim
nations, right?

36:28.142 --> 36:29.752
An excuse
for genocide.Right.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.928
So how does having
Kelby, a U.S. citizen,

36:31.972 --> 36:33.843
blow up a plane help
the Patton Project cause?

36:33.887 --> 36:35.889
It doesn't.Then why do it?

36:35.932 --> 36:37.934
Members of the Patton Project
are military.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.066
KENSI: Right.Right?

36:39.109 --> 36:41.373
They could have access
to no-fly lists.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.592
All types of people--

36:43.636 --> 36:45.812
you know, teachers,
students--

36:45.855 --> 36:48.467
they get put on those lists,
then they're cleared,

36:48.510 --> 36:49.946
then they're taken
off the lists.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.035
Lawford finds
suspected terrorists

36:52.079 --> 36:54.037
who were eventually cleared
and then allowed to fly.

36:54.081 --> 36:54.995
And they figure out
what flights they're on.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.997
Puts his person on the plane.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.521
Plane is blown up by an American
with mental illness.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.610
And it looks like it's the work
of a suspected terrorist.

37:01.654 --> 37:02.611
Nell, Eric.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.396
Find flights with Muslims

37:04.439 --> 37:06.398
that were previously on
the no-fly lists. Got it.

37:06.441 --> 37:10.228
Coming your way.Nice work.
I believe something

37:10.271 --> 37:12.969
this overt is not your
specialty. Thank you.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.802
So cross-checking flights
out of southern California,

37:19.846 --> 37:21.500
we found quite a
few with Muslims

37:21.543 --> 37:23.589
who were on the no-fly lists
who were then removed.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.112
There are 12
in the next two weeks,

37:25.155 --> 37:27.593
but one to Washington, D.C.
is boarding right now.

37:27.636 --> 37:28.985
Okay, we got to
ground that flight.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.770
Get me the DHS
and the FBI now.

37:30.813 --> 37:31.771
On our way.

37:31.814 --> 37:32.902
Hey, tell Kensi
and Deeks

37:32.946 --> 37:34.034
to bring Lawford
to the airport.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.078
Yeah.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.562
PILOT : Flight crew,
prepare for takeoff.

37:40.606 --> 37:41.694
Please secure all tray tables

37:41.737 --> 37:43.957
and turn off
all electronic devices.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.225
Oh, flag on the play.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.272
I'm sorry, folks. Tower's gonna
hold us here a few minutes.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.495
Flight's grounded.

38:00.539 --> 38:01.757
There's talk of
sending passengers

38:01.801 --> 38:03.019
through security
a second time.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.804
Do not do that.
They could spook the bomber,

38:04.847 --> 38:06.632
and when they get off,
they'll exit the airport.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.721
Start cross-checking the
passenger list, see if any...

38:08.764 --> 38:11.811
NELL:
See if any passengers spent time
in state psychiatric hospitals

38:11.854 --> 38:15.205
Lawford visited.
Already on it.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.642
PILOT:
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:16.685 --> 38:18.165
just a few more minutes here
and we'll be on our way.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.340
Thank you for your patience.

38:49.544 --> 38:50.719
Excuse me, miss,

38:50.763 --> 38:53.069
can your son come
with me, please?

38:53.113 --> 38:54.506
What's this about?

38:54.549 --> 38:56.725
Just please come with us.

39:03.471 --> 39:07.301
How'd we do?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.738
Looks like we have a winner.

39:09.782 --> 39:13.176
Let's go.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.830
Where'd you take my son?

39:14.874 --> 39:18.051
He's okay. You'll see him
in a few minutes.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.706
I'm gonna have to ask you
to remove your shirt.

39:20.749 --> 39:24.144
Ally.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.367
Okay. We're gonna do it.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.984
Stop.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.769
Looks like a liquid
binary explosive.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.771
I think I found the detonator.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.818
Got to get the
bomb squad in here.Let's go.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.778
You had your son
on that plane, Ally.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.743
We're gonna get you
the help you need.

39:57.786 --> 39:58.874
Okay?

40:00.920 --> 40:03.749
Nothing's ever helped me.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.541
You can say that again.

40:15.543 --> 40:18.764
Hmm, you look like
men with an agenda.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.243
We know who made the deal.

40:20.287 --> 40:21.419
What deal is that?

40:22.898 --> 40:24.900
The one that got
someone thinking

40:24.944 --> 40:26.728
that we'd work for Shaked,

40:26.772 --> 40:28.774
or people like him.

40:28.817 --> 40:32.517
Right. I made it.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.694
After Mexico, a lot of people
up the food chain had a problem

40:35.737 --> 40:38.958
with the NCIS
Office of Special Projects.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.438
They wanted to take it apart,

40:40.481 --> 40:43.005
discard its people.

40:43.049 --> 40:46.356
So you offer us out
as a black ops team.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.752
I saw good agents...
No, scratch that.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.407
I saw great agents
who were about to go down

40:53.451 --> 40:55.191
for the wrong reasons.

40:55.235 --> 40:58.543
And, yeah, I made a deal with
the devil to save your asses.

40:58.586 --> 41:00.414
To save your careers.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.634
And, more importantly,
to save lives.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.157
So you could do
what you did today.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.899
Today is not what we do.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.641
Yes, it is.SAM: Hey.

41:09.684 --> 41:13.122
We're not assassins.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.124
We don't do torture.

41:15.168 --> 41:17.779
No, it's not that simple,
and you know it.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.740
You know, in this business,

41:21.783 --> 41:24.307
we all have to walk
a moral tightrope.

41:24.351 --> 41:25.526
It's our job.

41:25.570 --> 41:28.964
You guys want easy...

41:29.008 --> 41:31.750
get a job at the post office.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.536
OCHOA:
And, FYI...

41:35.580 --> 41:37.625
there's no team I'd rather
walk that tightrope with

41:37.669 --> 41:38.887
than this one.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.411
Mm.

41:41.455 --> 41:44.110
Come with me.

41:55.034 --> 41:58.254
Whoa.
That's nice.

42:00.039 --> 42:03.477
Try to not burn this one.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.870
Good night, gentlemen.

42:08.743 --> 42:11.703
Well, if this is cause
for celebration,

42:11.746 --> 42:13.879
there is a nice little
Mexican place down the street

42:13.922 --> 42:15.228
if you want to join us.

42:16.838 --> 42:18.318
They got tequila?

42:18.361 --> 42:20.450
I believe they do.

42:20.494 --> 42:23.802
Well, it sounds good,
'cause, uh,

42:23.845 --> 42:26.021
there's something that I'd like
to talk to you guys about.

42:26.065 --> 42:28.458
Yeah

42:29.851 --> 42:33.333
TURK:
How cool it was
when I saved your lives.
