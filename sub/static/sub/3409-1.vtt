00:44.414 --> 00:47.247
<i>Happy birthday, Jacob!</i>

00:51.822 --> 00:54.620
I can't believe
the twins are 10.

00:57.694 --> 01:00.595
Rock, paper, scissors.

01:00.664 --> 01:02.791
Jacob stays.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.333
<i>One, two.</i>

01:06.403 --> 01:09.065
<i>Wait up, Daniel, we</i>
<i>want to hide with you.</i>

01:09.139 --> 01:11.164
<i>Slow down.</i>

01:23.153 --> 01:26.350
<i>It's cake time! Let's get</i>
<i>the young ones in here.</i>

01:37.567 --> 01:39.831
Jacob! Jacob!

01:50.080 --> 01:54.312
Daniel. Daniel,
my baby!

01:54.384 --> 01:57.410
<i>My baby.</i>

01:57.487 --> 02:00.285
<i>Jacob, call an ambulance.</i>

02:00.357 --> 02:03.292
<i>Jacob!</i>

02:19.342 --> 02:22.743
<i>Where's the bomb squad?</i>

02:22.812 --> 02:24.370
<i>It's coming!</i>

02:24.447 --> 02:27.280
<i>Clear these people out of here!</i>

02:27.350 --> 02:30.683
<i>Let's move. We've got</i>
<i>less than 5 minutes.</i>

02:30.754 --> 02:33.621
Help me.

02:33.690 --> 02:35.783
<i>God, it hurts.</i>

02:35.859 --> 02:39.659
My name is Jacob. It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna fix this.

02:39.729 --> 02:41.390
<i>I'm gonna talk</i>
<i>to you, alright?</i>

02:41.464 --> 02:45.230
I promise you, we're gonna solve
this right away. You hear me?

02:45.302 --> 02:50.365
<i>Somebody get me a fucking</i>
<i>blanket up in here!</i>

02:50.440 --> 02:54.877
<i>Looks like Billy Joe for sure.
She's got a C4 sewn up on her chest.</i>

02:54.945 --> 02:57.675
It's not like him to leave
her out in the open like this.

02:57.747 --> 02:59.578
No, he's flipping
the MO, man.

02:59.649 --> 03:04.484
<i>He's trying</i>
<i>to fuck with our heads.</i>

03:04.554 --> 03:06.249
<i>That's him.</i>

03:06.323 --> 03:08.188
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:08.258 --> 03:11.159
<i>And you know,</i>
<i>he's up there watching us right now.</i>

03:36.486 --> 03:38.283
<i>How's the view?</i>

03:38.355 --> 03:40.289
What the fuck are
you doing in my place?

03:40.357 --> 03:44.384
Mm-hm. The door was open and by
the looks of the decor around here,

03:44.461 --> 03:46.452
it don't look
like it's your place.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.191
Yeah, well granny
just checked out.

03:49.265 --> 03:53.599
The difference between you and me is,
you love to prey the weak and innocent,

03:53.670 --> 03:56.400
but I like to prey on
sick people like you

04:11.921 --> 04:13.320
Listen to me.

04:13.390 --> 04:17.224
<i>Which color wire do I cut?</i>

04:17.293 --> 04:20.319
The one that says
"fuck you" on it.

04:29.039 --> 04:30.973
<i>Which wire, Billy?</i>

04:33.243 --> 04:34.335
<i>Get up!</i>

04:36.946 --> 04:38.379
<i>Come on.</i>

04:42.485 --> 04:44.851
<i>Ready to talk? Huh?</i>

04:49.959 --> 04:52.450
<i>Which wire, Billy?</i>
<i>Which wire?</i>

04:57.901 --> 04:59.198
<i>Get up.</i>

05:02.539 --> 05:04.507
You ready to
talk to me?

05:06.776 --> 05:08.710
Come on,
white trash.

05:11.915 --> 05:13.746
Ah!

05:13.817 --> 05:15.682
Okay. Okay.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.718
Alright. Our suspect
is ready to cooperate.

05:19.789 --> 05:21.723
<i>I got it narrowed.</i>
<i>Yellow or black?</i>

05:21.791 --> 05:23.520
<i>Try pink, ass.</i>

05:28.198 --> 05:32.032
Yo Billy, we cut the
yellow or the black?

05:38.842 --> 05:40.139
<i>Yellow or black?</i>

05:40.210 --> 05:42.201
Out the black one.

05:42.278 --> 05:44.906
Out the yellow wire.

05:54.057 --> 05:56.355
<i>Cut the fucking yellow!</i>

06:01.297 --> 06:03.731
Ah.

06:05.602 --> 06:07.968
<i>We're clear.</i>

06:08.037 --> 06:10.403
All right, bitch.
You're under arrest.

06:10.473 --> 06:12.907
Get up against the
wall and give me a hand.

06:12.976 --> 06:14.170
fuck you!

06:17.313 --> 06:18.905
Ah!

06:26.956 --> 06:30.392
<i>Aw, hell no, Storm.
I think I dropped something.</i>

06:30.460 --> 06:33.258
<i>You see anything on</i>
<i>the street down there?</i>

06:37.066 --> 06:41.594
<i>Hey, looks like he got the hiccups.
Somebody get that guy a glass of water.</i>

06:57.020 --> 07:00.820
Hey. You gettin' any closer
to cracking the Grifter's code?

07:00.890 --> 07:04.155
Wilson? I don't know
about that, man.

07:04.227 --> 07:06.218
<i>This guy's smart,</i>
<i>but I'll get 'em.</i>

07:06.296 --> 07:11.165
You hear of the ODLU got that
scumbag Billy Joe Hill on appeal?

07:11.234 --> 07:13.099
Why does that
not surprise me?

07:13.169 --> 07:15.399
He's not gonna
walk though now, is he?

07:15.471 --> 07:20.568
If he does, he will kill again
right quick. And that's the truth.

07:20.643 --> 07:22.577
I know.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.268
What are you doing here?

07:55.345 --> 07:56.835
<i>I missed you.</i>

07:56.913 --> 08:00.644
<i>You must've been</i>
<i>here a long time.</i>

08:00.717 --> 08:03.151
I was in your
office earlier.

08:03.219 --> 08:06.950
It's kind of creepy.
What's with all these charts?

08:07.023 --> 08:10.049
<i>I bet it's the Grifter case.</i>

08:10.126 --> 08:12.287
You got that
right, darling, see,

08:12.362 --> 08:17.698
in Homicide we sometimes
have creepy guys,

08:17.767 --> 08:21.533
we gotta work with and this
particular guy is kinda creepy.

08:21.604 --> 08:24.300
He's killed four
people in five months.

08:28.711 --> 08:31.703
You work too hard.

08:31.781 --> 08:35.581
Well, you drink too much.

08:53.603 --> 08:55.468
<i>I have to work.</i>

09:26.803 --> 09:30.603
<i>Happy birthday, Jacob.</i>

09:38.348 --> 09:41.909
<i>One! Two!</i>

10:02.705 --> 10:05.139
<i>Come on. Here I come.</i>

10:05.208 --> 10:08.644
<i>Let go!</i>

10:14.650 --> 10:16.481
Hi, baby.

10:16.552 --> 10:19.316
Looking for anything?

10:30.266 --> 10:31.699
Oh!

11:01.998 --> 11:03.488
Do you need help?

11:03.566 --> 11:06.330
Could you?

11:06.402 --> 11:09.769
Appreciate that.
Very Christian of you.

11:09.839 --> 11:11.966
I never figured
these damn things out.

11:12.041 --> 11:15.477
No problem. Been
through this drill before.

11:17.079 --> 11:18.205
Ah!

11:22.652 --> 11:27.351
<i>A moon is cloaked in blood.
Amends must be made.</i>

11:27.423 --> 11:31.587
A time of great degeneration.

11:31.661 --> 11:34.186
No one has ears to hear.

11:35.631 --> 11:38.600
<i>No one speaks</i>
<i>the ultimate truth.</i>

11:38.668 --> 11:40.795
But I have heard the truth.

11:40.870 --> 11:43.338
I've seen the peaks.

11:43.406 --> 11:45.465
I've seen the valleys.

11:45.541 --> 11:50.069
I've seen the land
all around this world.

11:50.146 --> 11:53.013
And I've seen the light.

11:56.018 --> 11:58.578
I've seen it.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.828
You shut your mouth!

12:12.902 --> 12:15.063
<i>Shut your dirty mouth.</i>

12:17.006 --> 12:19.531
<i>Looks like the Grifter's at it again.</i>

12:19.609 --> 12:21.133
<i>Night shift</i>
<i>picked her up.</i>

12:21.210 --> 12:24.771
She wasn't just
murdered. She was punished!

12:24.847 --> 12:26.644
<i>You find the cipher?</i>

12:26.716 --> 12:28.581
<i>Yeah. Over here.</i>

12:28.651 --> 12:30.482
<i>What else you got, Is?</i>

12:30.553 --> 12:33.954
<i>Result of death, massive</i>
<i>blunt force trauma.</i>

12:34.023 --> 12:36.753
In other words, she
was beat to death.

12:36.826 --> 12:39.852
<i>There's oneinteresting thing</i>
<i>about these cases.</i>

12:39.929 --> 12:41.829
He likes to take
his time with some,

12:41.898 --> 12:45.493
<i>others like this poor girl,
he makes it real quick.</i>

12:45.568 --> 12:47.502
<i>You know what I was
starting to think, Is?</i>

12:47.570 --> 12:50.869
It almost seems like he
manipulates the time of death.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.238
Like he's watching
the clock or something.

12:53.309 --> 12:57.006
Do me a favor.
Pull up a time of death for each victim.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.217
<i>Junky, for sure.</i>

13:06.289 --> 13:07.483
Yeah, ain't they all?

13:07.557 --> 13:09.286
No. Not all.

13:11.494 --> 13:15.055
Just talked to the uniform who
canvassed the area where she was found.

13:15.131 --> 13:16.928
He name's Jessica.

13:16.999 --> 13:20.196
<i>Worked the curb some but mostly
did alcohol from Mojo Blues.</i>

13:20.269 --> 13:21.463
Mm-hm.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.032
<i>Hello? Yes. sir.</i>

13:25.107 --> 13:26.267
What else, brother?

13:26.342 --> 13:28.003
Hard to tell if
there was a rape.

13:28.077 --> 13:31.171
<i>She was a hooker by trade.</i>
<i>She's got a Cesarean scar.</i>

13:31.247 --> 13:33.374
<i>She must've had</i>
<i>at least one child.</i>

13:33.449 --> 13:36.543
<i>She was headed down a way path,
no matter how you look at it.</i>

13:36.619 --> 13:39.918
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:39.989 --> 13:44.756
Hand me some cotton swab,
brother. With some alcohol.

13:58.541 --> 14:00.736
<i>Look at that.</i>

14:00.810 --> 14:04.177
<i>This is the astrological</i>
<i>symbol for the full moon.</i>

14:04.246 --> 14:08.307
<i>Our man is really trying to tell us</i>
<i>something, ain't he now? </i>

14:08.384 --> 14:10.716
That's the Captain.

14:10.786 --> 14:15.951
He's wants to sit down. He's starting
to get a lot of heat from the press.

14:16.025 --> 14:18.493
<i>Yeah. I'm sure he is.</i>

14:50.960 --> 14:54.157
He's mostly
playing good.

14:56.532 --> 14:59.660
You look familiar.
Cop, right?

14:59.735 --> 15:01.896
Let me ask you something.

15:01.971 --> 15:04.462
Do you know a girl
called Jessica Trimble?

15:04.540 --> 15:07.100
I've seen her. She worked
this place for John's.

15:07.176 --> 15:09.838
I never talked to her
except to take drink orders.

15:09.912 --> 15:13.780
If you never talked to her,
how do you know her name?

15:13.849 --> 15:17.751
I watch the news. I've
seen you a bunch of times.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.344
You're some
hot shot, huh?

15:19.422 --> 15:21.583
Yeah, baby. A hot shot.

15:21.657 --> 15:24.649
Look, I need some help.

15:28.664 --> 15:31.633
<i>Them two, the</i>
<i>taller one's Leon.</i>

15:31.701 --> 15:33.464
He pimped her.

15:33.536 --> 15:35.197
Okay.

15:35.271 --> 15:37.671
Listen, this Leon,

15:37.740 --> 15:40.038
did you ever have
sex with him?

15:40.109 --> 15:44.603
<i>And I'm not asking for
the reasons you might think.</i>

15:44.680 --> 15:50.550
Yeah. He ain't that smart but
he's all right in that department.

15:57.126 --> 15:58.753
Hey, baby,
what's happening?

15:58.828 --> 16:00.386
Got people
waiting out front?

16:00.463 --> 16:02.124
I ain't need no
people out front.

16:02.198 --> 16:03.426
<i>I think you do.</i>

16:03.499 --> 16:06.468
Lord have mercy.

16:06.535 --> 16:09.800
Here's how it is with the police.
We come here, we ask questions,

16:09.872 --> 16:13.808
we canvas areas, we politely
do our job, you know.

16:13.876 --> 16:17.107
<i>Now, I got some questions</i>
<i>about Jessica Trimble.</i>

16:17.179 --> 16:19.736
Either I'm gonna arrest
you and take you downtown,

16:19.737 --> 16:21.240
or you're gonna talk to me now.

16:29.225 --> 16:31.216
<i>Looks like you</i>
<i>wanna talk to my fist.</i>

17:05.394 --> 17:06.656
Get that.

18:37.486 --> 18:39.750
Get up. Get up!

18:47.730 --> 18:48.958
<i>Batter up.</i>

18:59.909 --> 19:01.877
<i>Now it's my turn.</i>

19:04.046 --> 19:05.343
<i>Come on.</i>

19:06.615 --> 19:08.583
<i>Girls don't play.</i>

19:22.131 --> 19:23.564
Strike two.

19:24.733 --> 19:26.496
<i>And he's out!</i>

19:29.171 --> 19:30.968
<i>Don't wanna play?</i>

19:34.877 --> 19:36.572
<i>Gimme your best shot.</i>

20:25.160 --> 20:27.321
<i>Leon, stay down.</i>

20:27.396 --> 20:29.626
<i>My man, Leon.</i>

20:29.698 --> 20:32.861
<i>You ready to answer</i>
<i>my questions, Leon?</i>

20:32.935 --> 20:34.960
fuck you!

20:35.037 --> 20:37.938
<i>No. Fuck you.</i>

20:38.007 --> 20:40.373
Ah!

20:40.442 --> 20:42.603
Now,

20:42.678 --> 20:44.543
let me ask
you something,

20:46.515 --> 20:47.777
Now.

20:47.850 --> 20:49.078
Agh.

20:49.151 --> 20:51.517
When was the last
time you saw the girl?

20:51.587 --> 20:52.781
fuck you, man!

20:52.855 --> 20:54.789
Agh.

20:54.857 --> 20:58.623
I'm gonna ask you one more time. When
was the last time you saw the girl?

21:02.131 --> 21:03.462
Mother fucker!

21:03.532 --> 21:06.467
Agh. Days ago.

21:06.535 --> 21:07.627
Good.

21:07.703 --> 21:08.692
<i>Oh!</i>

21:08.771 --> 21:10.898
Now I believe your ugly ass.

21:13.842 --> 21:15.469
<i>I'll question</i>
<i>you downtown.</i>

21:15.544 --> 21:17.842
<i>You knocked my teeth
out, I'm gonna kill you!</i>

21:17.913 --> 21:22.213
<i>The uniform's on their way. You kill them
first and then come kill me, alright?</i>

21:22.284 --> 21:25.583
Come with me. I need
to take your statement.

21:36.965 --> 21:39.661
You're one
tough cop, honey.

21:53.048 --> 21:54.447
<i>Hey, Leon.</i>

21:54.516 --> 21:56.245
Get that mother fucker!

21:58.587 --> 21:59.952
Ah!

22:24.213 --> 22:25.578
Ah!

22:38.894 --> 22:40.521
<i>Look out!</i>

22:49.571 --> 22:50.629
Shit.

23:00.716 --> 23:03.150
fuck!

23:04.720 --> 23:06.585
Oh!

23:09.791 --> 23:11.850
<i>Come on.</i>

23:14.630 --> 23:16.530
<i>Detective King.</i>

23:16.598 --> 23:19.362
Two suspects ran down
that alley. One's wounded.

23:19.434 --> 23:22.528
All right.
Let's go get 'em.

23:22.604 --> 23:26.096
<i>Call the medic.</i>
<i>Another man down here.</i>

23:42.624 --> 23:44.819
<i>Detective Anderson,</i>

23:44.893 --> 23:46.258
this is Frankie Miller.

23:46.328 --> 23:48.262
<i>She's FBI.</i>

23:48.330 --> 23:51.265
I've been assigned to
look into the Grifter case.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.994
<i>Grifter?</i>

23:53.068 --> 23:55.502
Damn the press
and their nicknames.

23:55.571 --> 23:57.436
Jacob know about this?

23:57.506 --> 24:00.873
<i>You listen to me. I'm giving this
woman permission to go wherever</i>

24:00.943 --> 24:02.934
<i>or speak to</i>
<i>whoever she needs.</i>

24:03.011 --> 24:07.744
King's got a hell of a track record. We're
just interested in seeing how he does it.

24:07.816 --> 24:11.980
You keep this transition
smooth, or it's gonna get ugly.

24:12.054 --> 24:13.487
Ugly?

24:16.058 --> 24:18.288
Okay. Give us
your damn briefing.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.057
At this point, we don't know
why he chooses his victims.

24:22.130 --> 24:24.835
<i>what we do have is a
series of gruesome murders</i>

24:24.836 --> 24:26.328
<i>committed with brute force.</i>

24:26.401 --> 24:28.801
The body count as
of today is five.

24:28.870 --> 24:30.565
What's this guy's marker?

24:30.639 --> 24:33.073
He carves an astrological
symbol on the body.

24:33.141 --> 24:37.077
<i>On several occasions, he's left a
letter near the body or on the body.</i>

24:37.145 --> 24:39.306
<i>Symbols, cyphers.</i>
<i>That type of shit.</i>

24:39.381 --> 24:41.349
Jacob has it
partially decoded.

24:41.416 --> 24:43.247
But not completely.

24:43.318 --> 24:45.218
<i>Where the hell</i>
<i>is Jacob anyhow?</i>

24:45.287 --> 24:48.279
<i>He had every intention of being
here but something came up.</i>

24:48.357 --> 24:50.882
Kinda makes us look
like assholes, don't it?

25:03.605 --> 25:05.095
<i>Hey.</i>

25:25.594 --> 25:27.391
Where's Ryanne?

25:29.631 --> 25:33.158
The brunette in red.
Boyfriend just got back.

25:35.737 --> 25:39.036
She's so loaded on X,
she didn't even notice.

25:46.648 --> 25:49.845
Set it up.

26:03.398 --> 26:05.992
Your boyfriend's down
that alley over there.

26:06.068 --> 26:08.332
Okay. Thanks.

26:24.052 --> 26:25.417
<i>Hey, Ryanne.</i>

26:30.025 --> 26:32.755
<i>Where's your boyfriend?</i>

26:37.466 --> 26:42.665
<i>
Happy birthday, Daniel. Happy birthday, Jacob.</i>

26:45.240 --> 26:49.643
<i>Walt, Daniel. We want to hide with you.</i>

26:55.917 --> 26:58.852
<i>You're mine.</i>

27:15.370 --> 27:17.634
Hey. Sorry
about the hour.

27:17.706 --> 27:20.072
<i>Man, I'm a night owl.</i>
<i>You want a drink?</i>

27:23.879 --> 27:27.178
Trying to quit, but one
drink will be alright.

27:45.867 --> 27:49.030
What's on
your mind, baby?

27:49.104 --> 27:51.436
A lot of heat
coming down.

27:51.506 --> 27:54.669
<i>The Captain's pissed. The FBI
assigned's been assigned to the case.</i>

27:54.743 --> 27:59.077
That don't mean shit.

27:59.147 --> 28:01.775
We walk a fine line.

28:01.850 --> 28:04.717
But Jacob,
I need this pinch.

28:04.786 --> 28:08.017
Baby, you have
nothing to worry about.

28:08.089 --> 28:11.183
<i>There ain't nobody</i>
<i>gonna get your pinch.</i>

28:11.259 --> 28:13.090
Thanks, Jacob.

28:18.700 --> 28:22.659
I'm probably real
paranoid right about now.

28:30.111 --> 28:34.047
<i>So you'll give me a call
if you hear anything else, alright?</i>

28:34.115 --> 28:36.049
What's goin' on?

28:36.117 --> 28:38.176
<i>Another Grifter victim.</i>

28:38.253 --> 28:39.720
Mm-hm.
What about it?

28:39.788 --> 28:42.757
Up down there. follow me.
Celine was first on scene.

28:42.824 --> 28:44.155
Is that right?

28:53.969 --> 28:57.234
<i>Why is the crime
scene always on the top floor?</i>

29:06.915 --> 29:08.906
Good morning, Sunshine.

29:08.984 --> 29:10.679
<i>Morning, Detectives.</i>

29:10.752 --> 29:12.151
How are you doin'?

29:12.220 --> 29:14.085
<i>Better than that guy there.</i>

29:17.292 --> 29:20.728
<i>Detective King.</i>
<i>Frankie Miller, FBI.</i>

29:20.795 --> 29:22.228
Oh Lord have mercy.

29:22.297 --> 29:24.629
<i>Yeah folks downtown</i>
<i>told me you'd be coming,</i>

29:24.699 --> 29:26.929
<i>and they kinda want</i>
<i>me to cooperate.</i>

29:27.002 --> 29:29.129
Well, I'm not here
to get in the way,

29:29.204 --> 29:32.696
<i>mostly observe, possibly offer
some of my own expertise.</i>

29:32.774 --> 29:35.641
I'd love some of your
expertise, 'cause at your age,

29:35.710 --> 29:38.372
<i>you probably got a lot
more expertise than we do.</i>

29:38.446 --> 29:39.743
<i>Lots more.</i>

29:39.814 --> 29:41.281
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

29:41.349 --> 29:42.748
What's happenin' Crystal?

29:42.817 --> 29:44.682
<i>How are you, Mr. King?</i>

29:44.753 --> 29:46.653
<i>Fine. You keeping busy?</i>

29:46.721 --> 29:49.554
<i>I'm alright.
Take care of yourself right now.</i>

29:49.624 --> 29:52.218
I guess this wasn't
the place he was killed.

29:52.294 --> 29:54.990
No, sir, you look
at them drag marks.

29:55.063 --> 29:58.294
Definitely not.

29:58.366 --> 30:01.164
Can you just back up just a
little bit? Gimme a second.

30:01.236 --> 30:02.794
It's your world.

30:08.276 --> 30:10.642
The lacerations
around the neck there.

30:10.712 --> 30:14.341
<i>Looks like he was choked with
a rope. The Lord have mercy.</i>

30:14.416 --> 30:18.045
<i>See the carving on the hand?
That's a.</i>

30:18.119 --> 30:20.053
<i>It's a warning</i>
<i>to back off.</i>

30:20.121 --> 30:25.491
<i>Two murders in two days.</i>
<i>Our man's on the move.</i>

30:25.560 --> 30:27.460
<i>Take a look</i>
<i>at that mirror.</i>

30:27.529 --> 30:31.397
You know, there was a mirror at
the Jessica Trimble crime scene.

30:31.466 --> 30:34.526
<i>Exactly. Now</i>
<i>check this out.</i>

30:34.603 --> 30:37.071
As you can see,

30:37.138 --> 30:42.132
<i>the body drag marks of his heels are on
top of the drag marks from the mirror.</i>

30:42.210 --> 30:44.906
It's like a play for him.

30:44.980 --> 30:46.004
Nice.

30:46.081 --> 30:47.844
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:47.916 --> 30:50.646
<i>There was a mirror at the</i>
<i>Mosher crime scene.</i>

30:50.719 --> 30:53.620
He do like this
every time.

30:55.457 --> 30:57.357
I handled a homicide once.

30:57.425 --> 30:59.916
She handled a homicide once.
One time!

30:59.995 --> 31:03.658
<i>See if you can get that photographer
to come back here to bag his shoes.</i>

31:03.732 --> 31:07.190
I wanna take photographs of these
drag marks and the carving on his body.

31:07.268 --> 31:08.826
<i>Will do.</i>

31:08.903 --> 31:11.337
Stick around.
This girl can entertain you.

31:11.406 --> 31:14.569
Wouldn't you say, Storm?
She's very entertaining.

31:18.546 --> 31:20.980
Are you staying?

31:21.049 --> 31:24.610
I hate the smell when
they popped it a little.

31:24.686 --> 31:29.020
<i>You girls have a blast.</i>
<i>If it gets too strong in here, crack a window.</i>

31:35.363 --> 31:38.730
Agent Miller. Do you want a copy
of this report sent to your office?

31:38.800 --> 31:41.132
Thanks. That will
be appreciated.

31:44.005 --> 31:47.406
<i>I once had this case in a dumps
site, it was a complete nightmare,</i>

31:47.475 --> 31:49.966
there was trash everywhere
we just had to...

32:01.089 --> 32:03.284
Sweet.

32:03.358 --> 32:06.293
<i>Are you sure you're alright?</i>

32:06.361 --> 32:07.851
I'll be fine.

32:09.964 --> 32:11.989
I thought this
place was abandoned.

32:12.067 --> 32:14.228
The lower floor
still has some tenants.

32:14.302 --> 32:17.465
Drug fiends. We
already interviewed them.

32:17.539 --> 32:20.440
Where are you going?

32:20.508 --> 32:22.169
To make sure
everything's fine.

32:22.243 --> 32:25.235
Agent Miller, we shouldn't
get involved in domestic shit.

32:25.313 --> 32:27.873
Half the time the women
don't even press charges.

32:27.949 --> 32:31.350
You did or you didn't? If you don't
tell me, I'm gonna cut you open.

32:31.419 --> 32:34.946
Please, you've just smoked
too much crack. Relax!

32:36.491 --> 32:38.618
<i>Step away from her</i>
<i>and put the knife down.</i>

32:38.693 --> 32:39.990
Who the fuck are you?

32:40.061 --> 32:41.858
<i>Federal Agent.</i>
<i>Put the knife down!</i>

32:41.930 --> 32:43.056
Put the knife down!

32:43.131 --> 32:45.156
He's high. Please
don't shoot him.

32:45.233 --> 32:47.064
You gonna
shoot me, cop?

32:47.135 --> 32:51.196
No one's shooting. Just put the knife
down. We'll talk about this. Okay?

32:51.272 --> 32:53.570
She's been
fucking around.

32:53.641 --> 32:56.303
<i>I'm not good</i>
<i>enough for her.</i>

32:56.377 --> 32:57.742
That's not true.

32:57.812 --> 33:00.781
You're lying! Do you
think I don't see things?

33:00.849 --> 33:03.113
They know what's going
on behind my back!

33:03.184 --> 33:04.515
They're lying.

33:04.586 --> 33:07.953
Hey! Put the knife down,
or I'll put you down.

33:08.022 --> 33:09.785
So shoot me.
See if I give a fuck.

33:09.858 --> 33:11.951
If you didn't have
that badge and that gun

33:12.026 --> 33:14.824
you wouldn't be looking me
in the fuckin' eye, bitch.

33:25.774 --> 33:27.708
Are you okay?

33:27.776 --> 33:29.937
You didn't
have to hurt him.

33:31.212 --> 33:33.874
Are you okay, baby?

33:33.948 --> 33:37.679
I'm so sorry.

33:37.752 --> 33:39.982
I told you so.

33:40.054 --> 33:43.683
The bartender said the victim
was a venue promoter, Lance Myers.

33:43.758 --> 33:46.921
liked to pay cash, liked to
change locations every few weeks.

33:46.995 --> 33:50.692
<i>He said, "I never saw a
<i>more dedicated business man, "</i></i>

33:50.765 --> 33:53.199
"always showed the
kids a good time,"

33:53.268 --> 33:55.168
<i>"He's the best</i>
<i>boss I ever had"</i>

33:55.236 --> 33:58.000
Showed the kids a good time?
Sh! That's rich.

33:58.072 --> 34:00.563
This fucker's a
registered sex offender.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.337
He pays his
employees in cash.

34:02.410 --> 34:06.176
I need statements from everyone
up in there right quick, you hear?

34:15.156 --> 34:17.623
Hey, have you figured
out the code yet?

34:17.692 --> 34:20.717
Man, I'm real close
on this cypher baby.

34:20.795 --> 34:22.456
Real close.

34:22.530 --> 34:25.465
<i>I need to interview about Billy Joe Hill.</i>

34:25.533 --> 34:28.934
Detective Anderson,
you're first.

34:31.438 --> 34:34.408
The Captain says your
cooperation is expected.

34:35.976 --> 34:39.504
You ain't got anything
to worry about.

34:39.581 --> 34:44.143
How's your tummy, sweetheart.
I heard you lost your lunch.

34:54.228 --> 34:57.357
I was hoping we could talk
in a place a little more...

34:57.432 --> 34:59.923
A little more
romantic, perhaps?

35:00.001 --> 35:02.868
A little less sterile.

35:02.937 --> 35:05.599
That little incident
at the crime scene,

35:05.673 --> 35:07.698
you're not used to
field work, are you?

35:07.775 --> 35:11.142
I've done my share of field
work, mostly profile stuff.

35:11.212 --> 35:13.271
And you're asking
us the questions?

35:13.348 --> 35:17.409
We're talking about the psychology
of murder, not just the investigation,

35:17.485 --> 35:20.113
it's not for you to decide
whether I'm qualified.

35:20.188 --> 35:23.715
Oh. Please.

35:23.791 --> 35:29.457
What was your involvement
in the Billy Joe Hill arrest?

35:29.530 --> 35:34.467
Were you there when
King made the arrest?

35:34.535 --> 35:36.935
This guy's a real
piece of work.

35:37.005 --> 35:40.236
He was dishonorably
discharged after Desert Storm.

35:40.308 --> 35:44.472
He's trained as a medic but also as
a small arms and explosives expert.

35:44.545 --> 35:47.981
You can't be thinking
this guy's gonna walk.

35:48.049 --> 35:50.210
He already has.

35:50.285 --> 35:52.014
<i>It wasn't our call.</i>

35:52.086 --> 35:54.884
Witness refuse to testify
and the Court overturned it.

35:54.956 --> 35:58.619
<i>They found the excessive force used
by Detective King unconstitutional</i>

35:58.693 --> 36:00.820
and the DNA evidence
to be suspect.

36:00.895 --> 36:03.261
That animal should
be put to death.

36:03.331 --> 36:05.356
Right.

36:16.344 --> 36:18.039
<i>Here you go, Mr. Hill.</i>

36:25.019 --> 36:27.510
Hey, this was a
sweet kick in the ass.

36:30.658 --> 36:32.785
Shit.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.090
I got my
knife back.

36:35.163 --> 36:38.826
Why not? You're a
citizen again, Mr. Hill.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.028
<i>Call me Billy Joe.</i>

36:45.974 --> 36:48.101
Where's Detective King?

36:48.176 --> 36:52.613
<i>Headed out. Said</i>
<i>he'd be at the morgue.</i>

36:52.680 --> 36:54.307
<i>Is he avoiding me?</i>

36:54.382 --> 36:56.714
Ha! You wish.

36:56.784 --> 36:58.809
Listen, sport.
You'd better slow down.

36:58.886 --> 37:01.514
I don't know what they
taught you up there in DO,

37:01.589 --> 37:05.650
but you'd better make damn sure
you know what the hell you're doing.

37:29.350 --> 37:30.874
<i>Ice man!</i>

37:30.952 --> 37:33.182
<i>What's going on, baby?
You alright?</i>

37:33.254 --> 37:35.484
I'm starting to see
you more than a wife.

37:35.556 --> 37:37.353
<i>Is this my guy?</i>

37:37.425 --> 37:40.121
Man, what a shame.

37:40.194 --> 37:43.891
Pretty, pretty young girl
like this, end up like that.

37:43.965 --> 37:46.957
<i>It ain't right.</i>
<i>Where's my guy?</i>

37:47.035 --> 37:51.631
I didn't take a look around.
I'm up to my ass in dead bodies.

37:51.706 --> 37:53.640
<i>And he's at the</i>
<i>back of the line.</i>

37:53.708 --> 37:56.370
Oh he's at the
back of the line?

37:56.444 --> 37:59.641
And I thought I'm not gonna
have some preference, you know?

37:59.714 --> 38:02.410
<i>Do you know why</i>
<i>I became a pathologist?</i>

38:02.483 --> 38:05.350
A coroner, man. don't get
carried away with the title.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.411
<i>Clever.</i>

38:07.488 --> 38:12.391
<i>Lord have mercy. You're like a bad
rash, man, you ust keep coming back.</i>

38:12.460 --> 38:14.360
Yeah. Look, can I
talk to you for a bit.

38:14.429 --> 38:15.760
Sure enough.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.593
I'm going to the
coffee machine.

38:17.665 --> 38:19.064
What are you scared of?

38:19.133 --> 38:20.498
<i>I ain't scared of nothing.</i>

38:20.568 --> 38:22.297
The quicker I
get through this...

38:22.370 --> 38:24.167
The quicker I get
you out of my life.

38:24.238 --> 38:27.173
No. The quicker we can
investigate the case at hand.

38:27.241 --> 38:28.731
Well, tell me
what you need.

38:28.810 --> 38:31.540
I was hoping we could talk
in a place a little more...

38:31.612 --> 38:34.342
A little more charming?
This is police work.

38:34.415 --> 38:36.849
Come on up here,
meet my girl.

38:38.319 --> 38:40.412
Fine.

38:40.488 --> 38:43.116
Look, I'm just gonna
get straight to the point.

38:43.191 --> 38:47.924
There's several questions in regards to
the evidence gathered in the Hill case.

38:47.995 --> 38:50.555
That should all be
detailed in my report.

38:50.631 --> 38:53.657
Well, I'm sure it is, but we
still need to talk about it.

38:53.734 --> 38:58.603
Uh, well, you tell me specifically,
exactly what you want to know about,

38:58.673 --> 39:01.267
<i>and I'll give it all</i>
<i>to you. </i>

39:06.848 --> 39:09.180
Yeah.

39:11.586 --> 39:14.214
You're joking.

39:16.624 --> 39:20.958
Lord have mercy. The fu...
I'll get back to you.

39:21.028 --> 39:24.862
<i>So you're boy, Billy Joe,</i>

39:24.932 --> 39:27.196
just got out,

39:27.268 --> 39:32.035
<i>and in only one hour he</i>
<i>killed three more people.</i>

39:32.106 --> 39:34.165
How you like that?

39:43.251 --> 39:45.185
<i>I got it, baby.</i>

39:46.988 --> 39:49.081
You decoded
the latest sign?

39:52.493 --> 39:54.085
I broke the code.

39:54.162 --> 39:57.359
<i>"The soul you kill</i>
<i>is the soul you keep. "</i>

39:57.431 --> 40:01.197
<i>"At the edge of space,</i>
<i>this is the true religion. "</i>

40:01.269 --> 40:03.794
<i>I can read the words.</i>

40:03.871 --> 40:06.635
I just don't know
what he's saying.

40:54.622 --> 40:56.089
Hi. Excuse me.

40:56.157 --> 40:58.387
<i>I got a kinda of a
<i>long shot here for you.</i></i>

40:58.459 --> 41:00.188
Um.

41:00.261 --> 41:02.320
This individual

41:02.396 --> 41:05.422
<i>is a poet, I mean, at</i>
<i>least he thinks he is.</i>

41:05.499 --> 41:08.662
Do you recognize
any of this?

41:08.736 --> 41:12.331
Nothing I've
seen before. Sorry.

41:12.406 --> 41:13.737
Uh huh.

41:13.808 --> 41:16.368
Well, he does like
these astrology things,

41:16.444 --> 41:19.607
and this kind of poetry concerning
the arcane and the occult

41:19.680 --> 41:22.945
<i>and, I mean, you know where I can
find something like that here?</i>

41:23.017 --> 41:26.248
That's not my job.
Check the directory.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.551
Uh huh. I guess being
polite ain't your job either.

41:51.479 --> 41:57.008
<i>Closing time is in five minutes.</i>

42:06.294 --> 42:09.195
We're closing. Any luck?

42:09.263 --> 42:12.232
Hell, yeah, man.
I got all kinds of luck.

42:12.300 --> 42:14.427
Well, like I said,
we're closing.

42:14.502 --> 42:16.993
Hell, I'm just,

42:17.071 --> 42:21.201
getting ready to put
all this shit away now.

42:21.275 --> 42:23.937
Never mind. I can do
it quicker than you can.

42:24.011 --> 42:27.071
Hey, you're so nice
all of a sudden, huh?

42:34.121 --> 42:35.918
Southern Death Threat.

42:35.990 --> 42:37.321
What's that?

42:37.391 --> 42:39.859
The line you wrote down.
It's from their song.

42:39.927 --> 42:41.986
<i>That's what you're</i>
<i>looking for, right?</i>

42:42.063 --> 42:44.293
And where do you
think I can find them?

42:44.365 --> 42:47.129
A shit hole club on Western,
All About Eve,

42:47.201 --> 42:49.431
<i>They play the same</i>
<i>crappy songs every night.</i>

42:49.503 --> 42:52.404
A bunch of them
are astrology nuts.

42:54.709 --> 42:56.734
Man, you've
been a big help.

42:56.811 --> 42:58.870
Have a good night.

42:58.946 --> 43:01.278
You sure I can't put
this shit away for you?

43:35.516 --> 43:38.178
Hello.

44:10.050 --> 44:11.312
Fuck you, man.

44:11.385 --> 44:12.784
Fuck you!

44:12.853 --> 44:14.480
What do you think
you're doing?

44:25.499 --> 44:29.026
<i>That'll be</i>
<i>$5. 50. Thanks.</i>

44:29.103 --> 44:31.537
What do you
need, honey?

44:31.605 --> 44:33.470
I'm looking
for somebody.

44:33.541 --> 44:34.838
Aren't we all?

44:34.909 --> 44:36.342
Yes, ma'am
I suppose we are.

44:36.410 --> 44:38.071
<i>What's the name</i>
<i>of the band?</i>

44:38.145 --> 44:41.080
Southern Death Threat.
You like them?

44:41.148 --> 44:42.877
Are you an agent?

44:42.950 --> 44:44.611
Maybe.

44:44.685 --> 44:48.086
Their demo's coming out.
I wrote some of the songs.

44:48.155 --> 44:50.419
<i>That's what</i>
<i>I do. I write.</i>

44:50.491 --> 44:53.688
Screenplays mostly,
some songs.

44:53.761 --> 44:58.994
You know, man, I like lyrics, you know.
Man, that's what I'm interested in.

44:59.066 --> 45:01.660
space.
Did you write that?

45:01.735 --> 45:03.202
Hell, no.

45:03.270 --> 45:05.636
You know I like that.
Who wrote that?

45:05.706 --> 45:08.766
Really? It's
Lazarus wrote that.

45:08.843 --> 45:11.073
He's deep into the
science of astrology.

45:11.145 --> 45:12.874
<i>Sickest fuck</i>
<i>you'll ever meet.</i>

45:12.947 --> 45:14.414
Uh huh. Where he at?

45:14.482 --> 45:17.417
Him over there.
That's Lazarus.

45:29.697 --> 45:32.495
<i>Get outta the way.
Outta the way.</i>

45:48.816 --> 45:50.249
You can't...

45:56.423 --> 45:57.447
Oh!

46:03.731 --> 46:04.857
Watch out.

46:06.300 --> 46:07.767
<i>Hey, that's my car!</i>

46:43.804 --> 46:46.068
Ugh. Ugh.

47:38.959 --> 47:40.688
<i>Wool!</i>

48:45.325 --> 48:47.384
<i>You know I'm gonna get you!</i>

49:26.700 --> 49:28.167
<i>Hey!</i>

49:28.235 --> 49:30.601
<i>That way!</i>

49:35.843 --> 49:37.811
This is car
12 do you read?

49:37.878 --> 49:40.608
<i>Roger, Detective.</i>

49:40.681 --> 49:44.344
57 Poplar, 4th floor. Need
back up. I need cars now.

49:44.418 --> 49:46.079
I need cars now.

49:46.153 --> 49:47.984
<i>Roger that.</i>

50:13.013 --> 50:14.241
Get back, MPD.

50:15.516 --> 50:17.245
<i>Close the door!</i>

50:18.986 --> 50:20.385
<i>No!</i>

50:24.691 --> 50:26.215
Help!

50:26.293 --> 50:28.022
I just wanna
talk. Let her go.

50:30.230 --> 50:32.061
<i>No!</i>

50:37.905 --> 50:39.566
Get outta the hall!

50:42.209 --> 50:45.076
Get outta the way.
Outta the way!

51:07.267 --> 51:09.201
Ugh!

51:32.926 --> 51:35.326
All my life,

51:35.395 --> 51:37.863
I've searched for
a worthy adversary.

51:37.931 --> 51:40.491
Someone who
understands me.

51:40.567 --> 51:44.162
Someone who
appreciates my work.

51:44.238 --> 51:46.229
You're that one.

51:46.306 --> 51:48.934
You think?

51:49.009 --> 51:53.912
Love is law and
I ain't finished yet.

51:53.981 --> 51:56.609
You know, buddy?
We can make this alright now.

52:15.035 --> 52:17.503
<i>Your adversary, alright.</i>

52:17.571 --> 52:19.004
No!

52:50.285 --> 52:51.752
<i>I got you now.</i>

52:54.022 --> 52:55.148
For sure.

52:56.357 --> 52:58.518
You listen carefully.

53:06.534 --> 53:09.503
I can speak in tongues.

53:09.570 --> 53:12.130
<i>The language of the gods.</i>

53:12.206 --> 53:15.573
I can speak any language,
ancient or otherwise.

53:15.643 --> 53:18.134
Egyptian. Sanskrit.

53:18.212 --> 53:19.941
Hebrew.

53:21.549 --> 53:25.349
I can channel
spirits. Good and evil.

53:27.355 --> 53:29.619
Make 'em do my bidding.

53:31.392 --> 53:33.917
<i>I have not chosen you.</i>

53:36.731 --> 53:39.894
But you have been chosen.

53:39.968 --> 53:42.300
To walk with me.

53:47.208 --> 53:50.473
<i>I will walk with you.</i>

53:50.545 --> 53:55.005
<i>Before us,</i>
<i>looking as gods.</i>

53:59.587 --> 54:01.418
<i>Angels.</i>

54:03.157 --> 54:04.852
<i>Demons.</i>

54:04.926 --> 54:07.554
<i>Monsters.</i>

54:07.628 --> 54:11.189
But I will

54:12.300 --> 54:15.064
<i>Until we get right.</i>

54:35.990 --> 54:38.891
Where as once I was blind.

54:40.495 --> 54:42.725
Now I can see.

54:58.913 --> 55:00.574
Hallelujah.

55:19.767 --> 55:22.258
<i>Good morning.</i>

55:22.336 --> 55:24.167
Mm-hm.

55:24.238 --> 55:25.933
Damn.

55:27.475 --> 55:29.705
<i>You were something</i>
<i>else last night, lady.</i>

55:29.777 --> 55:31.745
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

55:31.813 --> 55:33.371
Oh, you know?

55:33.448 --> 55:35.040
Good morning.

55:49.430 --> 55:51.898
What you doing?

55:51.966 --> 55:54.400
Hm.

56:17.391 --> 56:19.018
Ow. Ow!

56:19.093 --> 56:20.185
<i>Get the fuck off me.</i>

56:20.261 --> 56:22.229
<i>Get the fuck off!</i>

56:22.296 --> 56:25.288
<i>I would have</i>
<i>killed you last night,</i>

56:25.366 --> 56:28.961
but you were so sweet.

56:29.036 --> 56:30.298
Ah!

56:30.371 --> 56:32.134
Fresh.

56:32.206 --> 56:33.969
Don't you move.

56:39.547 --> 56:42.072
<i>Hello?</i>

57:03.004 --> 57:04.562
<i>Agent Miller.</i>

57:06.340 --> 57:09.400
Sorry about the late notice, I know it's...

57:09.477 --> 57:12.776
Pretty damn rude.

57:12.847 --> 57:16.783
This investigation is being
supervised by my Agency,

57:16.851 --> 57:20.771
<i>and we have ultimate authority over
everything related to the Grifter case.</i>

57:20.772 --> 57:21.515
<i>Understand?</i>

57:21.589 --> 57:22.783
Hm.

57:22.857 --> 57:24.518
I'll take
that as a "yes."

57:24.592 --> 57:28.084
You can do whatever you want.
Now let's get on with it.

57:28.162 --> 57:31.495
Duffy! Bring in 42!

57:37.872 --> 57:41.501
You examined the
victims from the very first?

57:41.576 --> 57:42.838
Yes.

57:42.910 --> 57:44.605
And the count
to date is five?

57:44.679 --> 57:48.445
<i>Six. Three females</i>
<i>and three males.</i>

57:48.516 --> 57:52.247
And each death was a result of
blunt force trauma, a beating?

57:52.320 --> 57:53.617
Yeah.

57:53.688 --> 57:56.122
No inconsistencies
with the victim's wounds?

57:56.190 --> 57:57.782
<i>The only inconsistency</i>

57:57.858 --> 58:01.089
is amount of trauma between
the female victims and the male.

58:01.162 --> 58:02.459
The women
were beat less?

58:02.530 --> 58:04.623
<i>No. He toys with</i>
<i>the females more.</i>

58:04.699 --> 58:08.226
<i>They received</i>
<i>much more trauma.</i>

58:08.302 --> 58:11.897
Are you aware of why we're
interested in this case?

58:11.973 --> 58:14.032
You want the truth?

58:17.011 --> 58:20.913
Wrong. Unfortunately,
it's not simple.

58:39.700 --> 58:42.328
It's the first
male victim.

58:44.805 --> 58:47.296
He's a little ripe.

58:47.375 --> 58:49.707
The flesh found
underneath the fingernails,

58:49.777 --> 58:52.644
<i>It matches the DNA from the
second female victim, right?</i>

58:52.713 --> 58:54.010
Makes sense, don't it?

58:54.081 --> 58:55.946
Well, it does
and it doesn't.

58:56.017 --> 58:59.783
Fingernails are used by females in
a defensive manner but not by a man.

58:59.854 --> 59:03.153
That's textbook. A man will
do anything to defend himself.

59:03.224 --> 59:07.888
<i>Scratch, kick, bite I've seen it all.
Don't seem strange to me.</i>

59:07.962 --> 59:10.692
Well, the sample we
got made it seem strange.

59:10.765 --> 59:13.325
<i>Under which fingernail</i>
<i>was it recovered?</i>

59:13.401 --> 59:15.869
<i>Right index finger.</i>

59:15.936 --> 59:19.895
I'm gonna need a close
up photo of that finger.

59:19.974 --> 59:21.566
Why?

59:21.642 --> 59:24.577
Just get it done. Someone
will pick it up tonight.

59:37.958 --> 59:39.585
<i>Hey.</i>

59:42.596 --> 59:45.360
What happened
to your arm?

59:45.433 --> 59:46.866
Nothing.

59:49.403 --> 59:50.893
I wanted to talk to you.

59:50.971 --> 59:52.199
Okay.

59:52.273 --> 59:54.673
Nights has an opening.

59:54.742 --> 59:56.903
Nights always
has openings.

01:00:00.147 --> 01:00:04.447
I think they can get me changing shifts.
Something different.

01:00:07.955 --> 01:00:11.550
Just wanted to check it with
you first, see what you thought.

01:00:17.565 --> 01:00:20.864
This move, it'll help
me become a detective.

01:00:20.935 --> 01:00:22.664
<i>Like you.</i>

01:00:22.737 --> 01:00:25.570
You should go for it.

01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:39.820
<i>Thought you went
back to Washington, little lady.</i>

01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:41.616
What would make
you think that?

01:00:41.689 --> 01:00:44.920
Since you're out of work. Jacob
nearly got this thing solved.

01:00:44.992 --> 01:00:47.620
Jacob has a possible
suspect. Nothing more.

01:00:47.695 --> 01:00:49.959
It can be a little bit
more than that, you see?

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:54.399
<i>I made out with his wallet.
Inslde I found a necklace.</i>

01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:56.936
<i>I waiting for confirmation,</i>
<i>but my guess is,</i>

01:00:57.004 --> 01:01:01.998
<i>the DNA from this matches the
dead prostitute, Jessica Trimble,</i>

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:05.603
<i>an individual named Lazarus
Jones, a convicted sex offender</i>

01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:08.409
<i>day parole</i>
<i>for a long time now.</i>

01:01:08.482 --> 01:01:10.950
That's why
he's the lead dog.

01:01:11.018 --> 01:01:13.145
You gotta take notes.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.744
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:01:14.822 --> 01:01:17.086
Why didn't
I get the lab reports?

01:01:17.158 --> 01:01:20.218
Well, I just like to keep shit
kinda close to my vest, you know.

01:01:20.294 --> 01:01:21.727
That's not protocol.

01:01:21.796 --> 01:01:23.320
I'm not too good at protocol.

01:01:23.397 --> 01:01:26.525
<i>Great. Thanks. Okay.</i>

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.230
<i>The DNA tests results confirmed
it Lazarus Jones is the Grifter.</i>

01:01:31.305 --> 01:01:33.830
Where are you going?

01:01:33.908 --> 01:01:38.811
Well, I'm gonna go get his ass.
You can come if you all wanna see.

01:01:38.879 --> 01:01:41.814
<i>Storm, put out an APB.</i>

01:01:41.882 --> 01:01:45.147
So, what you
got, little lady?

01:01:51.992 --> 01:01:55.450
So you mind telling
me where we're going?

01:01:55.529 --> 01:01:57.190
didn't that his license?

01:01:57.264 --> 01:02:01.098
Sure enough. The address is
legit, but no doubt he's long gone.

01:02:01.168 --> 01:02:02.863
Did you tell
the uniforms?

01:02:02.937 --> 01:02:06.134
I didn't tell the uniforms. I
need that crime scene preserved.

01:02:06.207 --> 01:02:08.334
Besides, we're
the Detectives.

01:02:24.725 --> 01:02:27.785
<i>Lazarus Jones. MPD!</i>

01:02:51.752 --> 01:02:53.583
We're clear.

01:02:53.654 --> 01:02:56.384
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>he's long gone.</i>

01:03:37.865 --> 01:03:39.992
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.987
Lazarus!

01:05:15.062 --> 01:05:17.053
FBI. We just wanna talk.

01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:08.238
Ugh.

01:06:58.031 --> 01:07:00.158
Jacob!

01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:19.846
Something ain't
right, man.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.115
Why would he bring
the body back here?

01:07:22.189 --> 01:07:24.214
We should've moved
faster. We had him.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:26.156
Yeah, we had him.

01:07:26.226 --> 01:07:29.718
<i>That guy was gone the second he
dropped his< wallet in that alley.</i>

01:07:30.831 --> 01:07:31.695
Hmpf.

01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:50.606
<i>I'm telling ya'. I think I've
just about got this cracked.</i>

01:07:50.684 --> 01:07:54.984
<i>Lazarus is spelling out divination.
He's telling us the future</i>

01:07:55.055 --> 01:07:57.387
with his
astrological riddles.

01:07:57.457 --> 01:08:00.949
<i>He's timed his</i>
<i>killings on lunar phases.</i>

01:08:01.028 --> 01:08:03.394
<i>On his last victims</i>
<i>he got full moon,</i>

01:08:03.463 --> 01:08:05.658
<i>waning gibbous</i>
<i>and third quarter.</i>

01:08:05.732 --> 01:08:08.132
<i>next is the waning</i>
<i>crescent. That's tonight.</i>

01:08:08.202 --> 01:08:10.568
<i>What that tell ya?</i>
<i>He gonna kill tonight.</i>

01:08:10.637 --> 01:08:13.197
Mm-hm.

01:08:13.273 --> 01:08:16.140
Do we know where?

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:18.337
We're close, baby.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.343
<i>This constellation's</i>
<i>called Arianna's crown.</i>

01:08:23.417 --> 01:08:25.544
It has nine stars in it.

01:08:25.618 --> 01:08:29.645
<i>I believe these stars somehow correlate
to the locations of the killings.</i>

01:08:29.723 --> 01:08:31.884
<i>I just need</i>
<i>to figure out how.</i>

01:08:31.959 --> 01:08:36.760
Listen, I'm gonna go home, spend some
solitary time trying to figure this out.

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.729
<i>Keep the Fed</i>
<i>busy, will ya?</i>

01:08:38.799 --> 01:08:41.666
<i>Don't you worry.</i>
<i>I can handle that.</i>

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.870
No.

01:10:42.756 --> 01:10:44.553
<i>Still working on</i>
<i>that Grifter case?</i>

01:10:44.624 --> 01:10:45.818
I am.

01:10:45.892 --> 01:10:47.382
<i>Closing in on him?</i>

01:10:47.461 --> 01:10:49.019
I definitely am.

01:10:49.096 --> 01:10:52.827
<i>He was using the
distances between the stars</i>

01:10:52.899 --> 01:10:55.561
in this constellation
of Arianna's crown.

01:10:55.635 --> 01:10:59.435
<i>and mirroring that over</i>
<i>the city of Memphis,</i>

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:02.532
to a scale that
he made up himself.

01:11:02.609 --> 01:11:04.804
If you put this here,

01:11:04.878 --> 01:11:11.477
<i>and I trace all</i>
<i>of the murder sites,</i>

01:11:11.551 --> 01:11:15.009
<i>we place this over this
diagram of Arianna's crown,</i>

01:11:15.088 --> 01:11:19.889
<i>that I found at his den, as you can
see, there's two starts missing.</i>

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.929
<i>His next kill is one</i>
<i>of these two locations.</i>

01:11:22.996 --> 01:11:27.797
Now, once I cracked the last cypher,
I knew it could only be one place.

01:11:54.361 --> 01:11:56.886
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:03.669
Ugh!

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:31.219
<i>Jacob!</i>

01:13:01.528 --> 01:13:03.428
Ah!

01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:06.595
<i>Ugh!</i>

01:13:17.544 --> 01:13:19.444
Bitch.

01:13:35.195 --> 01:13:39.154
<i>This is for</i>
<i>you, Agent Miller.</i>

01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:40.927
Thank you.

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:43.231
You got the wrong
impression of him, kid.

01:13:43.303 --> 01:13:44.861
<i>Jacob's a good man.</i>

01:13:44.938 --> 01:13:46.200
That's your opinion.

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:52.137
Did you ever hear about the case
of the Cannibal of South County?

01:13:52.212 --> 01:13:53.941
No.

01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:57.006
<i>That was the first case Jacob
and I ever did together.</i>

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:59.608
I studied his file.
I don't remember that case.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:02.484
Well, I fuckin' do. Seven
days and seven nights,

01:14:02.556 --> 01:14:04.353
<i>searching non stop,</i>

01:14:04.424 --> 01:14:08.292
until we finally cornered that bitch
in an apartment on the South Side.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.429
And?

01:14:11.498 --> 01:14:13.295
He was inside.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:16.699
<i>I wanted to call back up,
but Jacob wouldn't let me.</i>

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:18.863
<i>He said we have to move fast.</i>

01:14:18.939 --> 01:14:21.464
<i>That's typical.</i>

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.202
<i>I was like you.</i>
<i>I doubted him.</i>

01:14:23.276 --> 01:14:25.369
<i>You went inwithout back up?</i>

01:14:25.445 --> 01:14:27.970
<i>You're damn right.</i>
<i>We didn't need none.</i>

01:14:28.048 --> 01:14:30.710
<i>I had his back</i>
<i>and he had mine.</i>

01:14:30.784 --> 01:14:34.880
I was scared. I ain't gonna
lie to you. I was scared.

01:14:34.955 --> 01:14:37.822
<i>This man was</i>
<i>not only a killer,</i>

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:40.883
he was a mother
fucking cannibal.

01:14:40.961 --> 01:14:43.225
And what happened?

01:14:43.296 --> 01:14:47.164
<i>Well, we moved</i>
<i>in, real slow.</i>

01:14:47.234 --> 01:14:49.361
Being real quiet.

01:14:49.436 --> 01:14:53.133
Shit, we were so quiet, you
could hear a rat piss on a cat.

01:14:53.206 --> 01:14:55.197
<i>And then, lightening.</i>

01:14:55.275 --> 01:14:57.835
<i>He stood there real</i>
<i>calm, opened the door.</i>

01:14:57.911 --> 01:15:00.038
Real slow

01:15:00.113 --> 01:15:03.344
And then we saw him,
with his back towards us,

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:08.683
<i>kneeled down, over</i>
<i>a dead fucking clown.</i>

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:10.985
A clown?

01:15:11.057 --> 01:15:14.083
<i>Yeah. Some guy he got</i>
<i>from the local carnival.</i>

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.525
<i>Still in full make up.</i>

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:18.462
He was bent over,
chewing on him.

01:15:18.531 --> 01:15:20.897
<i>Eating his flesh</i>
<i>and sucking his bone,</i>

01:15:20.967 --> 01:15:24.368
Like it was the last
barbecue rib at Rendezvous.

01:15:26.339 --> 01:15:27.806
Shit.

01:15:27.874 --> 01:15:29.171
Right in front of you?

01:15:29.242 --> 01:15:30.436
<i>Right in front of us.</i>

01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:33.104
<i>I was shaking</i>
<i>and I called out.</i>

01:15:33.179 --> 01:15:35.113
Freeze! Mother fucker!

01:15:35.181 --> 01:15:39.277
<i>And Jacob, he's standing there,
like ice running through his veins.</i>

01:15:39.352 --> 01:15:44.153
<i>Gun covering down,
hammer starting ease back.</i>

01:15:44.224 --> 01:15:46.784
<i>This guy turned</i>
<i>around real slow,</i>

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.455
<i>blood all over his mouth where
he'd been eating this damn clown,</i>

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:53.294
<i>Son of a bitch. Then what?</i>

01:15:53.366 --> 01:15:55.800
He just stood there.

01:15:55.869 --> 01:15:59.862
<i>Real calm. Like it didn't even make
no difference that we was even there.</i>

01:15:59.939 --> 01:16:04.171
<i>And then he slowly holds this arm
towards us like he's offering it to us.</i>

01:16:04.244 --> 01:16:05.336
You're kidding me.

01:16:05.412 --> 01:16:08.006
Nah, I wouldn't bullshit you.

01:16:08.081 --> 01:16:12.074
He had this arm in his hand,
blood all over his fucking mouth,

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.113
And you know
what he said to us?

01:16:15.188 --> 01:16:16.314
<i>What?</i>

01:16:18.758 --> 01:16:22.558
Does this taste
funny to you?

01:16:24.964 --> 01:16:26.727
Good one. Let's go.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.167
I get it, he was eating
a clown. Very funny.

01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:39.042
Wait.

01:16:39.112 --> 01:16:42.047
<i>Jacob's DNA was found on the
fingers of the latest victim.</i>

01:16:48.621 --> 01:16:49.713
<i>I like that.</i>

01:16:49.789 --> 01:16:50.983
Good. Okay.

01:16:51.057 --> 01:16:52.718
Thank you.

01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:08.997
Lazarus Jones. MPD. You're under
arrest. Put your hands in the air.

01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:14.109
<i>I said put them</i>
<i>in the air, boy!</i>

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.943
Do it!

01:17:26.326 --> 01:17:28.157
You all get
outside. Go on!

01:17:28.228 --> 01:17:30.890
<i>This is car 12.
I need back up.</i>

01:17:43.777 --> 01:17:45.574
<i>I wanna beat you silly.</i>

01:17:51.551 --> 01:17:52.984
<i>Ready, baby?</i>

01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:05.390
<i>You're the tough guy.</i>

01:18:06.866 --> 01:18:08.891
<i>Like to beat helpless women?</i>

01:18:12.105 --> 01:18:13.595
<i>Slap 'em?</i>

01:18:14.841 --> 01:18:16.206
<i>Punch 'em?</i>

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.306
<i>Like this?</i>

01:18:22.549 --> 01:18:23.982
<i>How about that?</i>

01:18:29.322 --> 01:18:30.619
<i>How about that?</i>

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.729
<i>You like it, sport?</i>

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.158
<i>How's it now.</i>

01:20:34.213 --> 01:20:35.510
<i>Come on.</i>

01:20:38.151 --> 01:20:39.584
<i>Want a piece of me?</i>

01:20:39.652 --> 01:20:41.449
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

01:20:42.822 --> 01:20:44.585
<i>Take your best shot.</i>

01:20:55.001 --> 01:20:56.093
<i>You feel that?</i>

01:20:58.271 --> 01:20:59.238
<i>Come on!</i>

01:21:04.477 --> 01:21:06.468
<i>You like to break</i>
<i>bones, right?</i>

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:10.715
<i>Ugh!</i>

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:12.512
Agh!

01:21:15.021 --> 01:21:17.046
<i>I think your arm's broken.</i>

01:21:17.123 --> 01:21:18.181
Agh!

01:21:19.826 --> 01:21:22.090
He just broke a rib.

01:21:23.396 --> 01:21:25.261
<i>There goes another one.</i>

01:21:25.331 --> 01:21:26.491
Ah!

01:21:26.566 --> 01:21:28.124
That's right.

01:21:36.542 --> 01:21:40.000
<i>Oh, your knees hurt?
Let me see what I can do about that.</i>

01:21:41.848 --> 01:21:43.679
<i>Enough, Detective King.</i>

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:45.274
<i>We got him.</i>

01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:48.047
<i>Make sure Storm takes his confession.</i>

01:21:48.121 --> 01:21:49.748
<i>He's the Grifter.</i>

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.380
<i>No!</i>

01:21:51.457 --> 01:21:54.017
<i>My arm, you fucker, my arm!</i>

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.853
<i>It just don't add up.</i>

01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:59.659
<i>Maybe I'm just</i>
<i>not getting it.</i>

01:21:59.732 --> 01:22:02.667
<i>The facts are the facts.
The lab results just came in.</i>

01:22:02.735 --> 01:22:06.569
<i>The DNA found on the dead barmaid's
fingers at his farm match's Jacob's.</i>

01:22:06.639 --> 01:22:08.266
Bullshit. That
can't be right.

01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:11.071
The facts are all
pointing in one direction.

01:22:11.144 --> 01:22:13.806
<i>I mean, you saw it,
he had a fresh scratch on his arm.</i>

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.872
<i>And Lazarus has disappeared
that's if he even exists.</i>

01:22:19.052 --> 01:22:23.989
Look, I'll agree to something
that I would rather die than admit.

01:22:24.057 --> 01:22:26.890
He is a genius. But I believe
he uses the same genius

01:22:26.959 --> 01:22:29.792
<i>to catch the bad guys</i>
<i>to hide his own criminality.</i>

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.890
<i>Jacob killed</i>
<i>that barmaid.</i>

01:22:34.967 --> 01:22:38.164
Listen, you lost
your damn mind.

01:22:38.237 --> 01:22:41.866
<i>It's the perfect murder. The
killer investigates his own crime</i>

01:22:41.941 --> 01:22:45.342
<i>and pins it on a serial killer
he's already investigated.</i>

01:23:28.521 --> 01:23:29.613
Ah!

01:23:33.025 --> 01:23:37.155
<i>You know, the sick thing is,
you killed her to get to me.</i>

01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:40.631
All you had to do is call
my mother fucking name.

01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:47.172
Yeah, You're gonna bend over and I'm
gonna stick my size 14 up your ass.

01:23:54.847 --> 01:23:55.836
Ah!

01:24:02.455 --> 01:24:03.945
<i>Come on!</i>

01:24:04.023 --> 01:24:05.320
Ah!

01:24:08.594 --> 01:24:11.188
<i>Looks like old times,</i>
<i>ain't it Billy Joe.</i>

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.297
<i>Want some more?</i>

01:24:15.368 --> 01:24:16.767
Come on, mother fucker.

01:24:44.964 --> 01:24:46.898
<i>You like knives, right?</i>

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:21.090
<i>Where are you</i>
<i>going, boy?</i>

01:25:28.441 --> 01:25:30.204
No appeal this time.

01:25:43.289 --> 01:25:45.416
<i>Get up, ol' Billy.</i>

01:25:47.994 --> 01:25:49.461
<i>Come on.</i>

01:26:08.014 --> 01:26:09.413
Come on here, Billy.

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:26.288
Ah!

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.425
Fuck you!

01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:31.493
<i>You're gonna regret this.</i>

01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:33.800
Here comes,
mother fucker!

01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:36.806
Here comes! Ah!

01:26:48.054 --> 01:26:50.215
You've killed me.

01:26:50.289 --> 01:26:53.224
<i>Nah, you don't</i>
<i>look dead yet.</i>

01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:55.226
I do.

01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:02.597
Holy shit

01:27:05.404 --> 01:27:06.962
<i>Now you look dead.</i>

01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:37.594
Storm, come on. Let's go.

01:27:50.316 --> 01:27:52.181
Jacob?

01:27:54.687 --> 01:27:55.881
Right.

01:27:55.955 --> 01:27:57.320
Jacob!
