00:00.618 --> 00:04.281
Everyone here knows that a murder
was committed here this weekend.

00:04.355 --> 00:06.118
One of you knows who did it.

00:06.190 --> 00:10.456
I am Sir Fearing Pangborn,
the world's greatest tragedian.

00:12.530 --> 00:13.827
Great costume.

00:13.898 --> 00:15.331
You look even dumber than me.

00:15.399 --> 00:17.867
I happen to be a famous
genius from the '20s.

00:17.969 --> 00:21.530
"Is this a dagger
which I see before me?"

00:24.041 --> 00:27.738
"All the world's a stage And the
men and women merely players -."

00:27.812 --> 00:29.006
Get down!

01:37.081 --> 01:39.675
<i>It wasn't the first
time I'd been up all night...</i>

01:39.750 --> 01:41.650
<i>but it was one of
the most rewarding.</i>

01:41.719 --> 01:43.687
<i>Forget the pain
in the weary eyes...</i>

01:43.754 --> 01:46.188
<i>the cries for rest
from the tired body...</i>

01:46.257 --> 01:48.555
<i>the screams of
the totally drained mind...</i>

01:48.626 --> 01:51.094
<i>struggling to deal
with one more clue.</i>

01:51.162 --> 01:54.393
<i>You don't sleep
until a crime is solved.</i>

01:55.499 --> 01:57.899
<i>Because there's no
greater satisfaction...</i>

01:57.968 --> 02:00.493
<i>than finally putting head
to pillow with the words:</i>

02:00.571 --> 02:01.595
<i>"Cases solved."</i>

02:02.740 --> 02:04.537
<i>"Cases," plural.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:07.639
<i>Six murders since
early last night.</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:09.144
<i>I had watched
the first annual...</i>

02:09.213 --> 02:11.681
<i>KHKU Agatha Christie
Film Festival...</i>

02:11.749 --> 02:15.947
<i>in its entirety and had pegged
five out of six murderers.</i>

02:16.687 --> 02:19.019
<i>Agatha got
the whole half-dozen.</i>

02:19.523 --> 02:22.083
<i>Goodnight, Miss Marple,
wherever you are.</i>

02:34.038 --> 02:35.027
Higgins.

02:40.511 --> 02:41.671
Higgins.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.475
Higgins!
Magnum, good morning.

02:47.785 --> 02:51.152
I'm conducting my annual
battle with the mongooses.

02:51.222 --> 02:52.655
Wretched creatures.

02:52.723 --> 02:55.248
The price of a perfect lawn
is eternal vigilance.

02:55.326 --> 02:57.521
Stop! Will you stop?

02:59.330 --> 03:01.059
Higgins, stop.
It's 6:00 a. m.

03:01.132 --> 03:04.192
I haven't slept and you're doing
more damage than the mongeese.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.702
Mongooses. And you
certainly can't sleep now.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.533
In precisely one hour,
the crew will be here...

03:08.606 --> 03:10.506
to roll the lawn good
as new for the gala.

03:10.574 --> 03:11.802
Surely, you haven't forgotten?

03:11.876 --> 03:14.037
Robin's charity bash,
how could I forget?

03:14.111 --> 03:17.205
A home for incorrigible boys.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.442
I'm sure you can
identify with them.

03:19.850 --> 03:21.909
And what are you
identifying with?

03:21.986 --> 03:23.476
The party theme, of course.

03:23.554 --> 03:25.920
Like the guests, we should come
in costumes of the period...

03:25.990 --> 03:28.982
for <i>The Great Gatsby</i> weekend,
to be as inconspicuous as possible.

03:29.059 --> 03:32.358
Inconspicuous? Higgins, don't do
that. Two of those could be dangerous.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.397
This is their base station.

03:34.498 --> 03:37.592
And may I remind you that I am
something of a demolitions expert?

03:37.668 --> 03:39.659
Did I ever tell you
about the time in India...

03:39.737 --> 03:42.365
when Corky Boswick brought two
untouchables to headquarters?

03:42.439 --> 03:44.339
Tell me 20 yards from here!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.073
Strange.

03:50.247 --> 03:53.341
There appears to be
some obstruction in the-

04:00.291 --> 04:02.418
Bloody good shot.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.597
Three
and four and one and two...

04:12.670 --> 04:15.195
A concussion
from a croquet ball?

04:15.272 --> 04:19.298
Yeah, just a mild one but Doc Ibold
has Higgins in bed for a few days...

04:19.375 --> 04:20.866
which sticks me
with the Gatsby thing.

04:20.945 --> 04:22.469
Thanks, Jennifer.
What thing?

04:22.546 --> 04:25.242
The Gatsby, you know,
<i>The Great Gatsby?</i>

04:25.316 --> 04:26.783
The magician?

04:27.151 --> 04:31.212
No, Orville. <i>The Great Gatsby</i> was
a book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

04:31.288 --> 04:34.223
It's all about the
idle rich of the '20s.

04:34.391 --> 04:38.088
Well, this is a '20s costume party
for the idle rich of the '80s.

04:38.162 --> 04:40.426
You know, Robin's usual crowd.

04:40.831 --> 04:44.267
European royalty, writers,
famous artists...

04:44.602 --> 04:45.967
couple of dancers.

04:46.637 --> 04:47.661
Dancers.

04:47.738 --> 04:50.434
Dancers? Did you say dancers?
I mean, what kind of dancers?

04:50.507 --> 04:53.704
Oh, I don't know. "Inez"
somebody was one of them.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.774
Inez Stuart?
Yeah, that's the one.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.747
Oh, man, she was
the greatest dancer...

04:59.817 --> 05:01.307
of all times, I mean-

05:01.385 --> 05:03.285
Anyway, with Higgins down...

05:03.354 --> 05:05.481
I have to cover the party
and miss...

05:06.223 --> 05:08.157
the best Rainbow game
of the season.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.318
So, who wants them, guys?
Half price.

05:11.128 --> 05:12.561
Just hold on.

05:12.763 --> 05:16.665
Look, you can't cover all of
Higgins' bases by yourself.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.531
Especially with
that ritzy crowd...

05:18.602 --> 05:20.968
I mean, Orville and I will
be glad to help you. Right?

05:21.038 --> 05:22.528
What? No, T.C.

05:22.606 --> 05:26.064
You're not interested in Thomas' workload.
You just want to meet this tutu type.

05:26.143 --> 05:29.237
That's fine. I will take
the basketball tickets.

05:29.780 --> 05:31.577
Very funny, Thomas!

05:31.649 --> 05:33.776
These tickets are
from last year's game!

05:33.851 --> 05:36.649
Oh, come on, guys.
It's for a real worthy cause:

05:36.720 --> 05:38.347
A home for incorrigible boys.

05:38.622 --> 05:41.113
Sorry, Thomas. But I'm
doing social work tonight.

05:41.191 --> 05:43.625
With an incorrigible girl.
Cute.

05:43.694 --> 05:46.288
Cuddly and blonde and...

05:46.730 --> 05:47.788
bye.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.992
Come on, Thomas. Forget about
Orville, we don't need him.

05:51.068 --> 05:53.036
I can help you with
this plainclothes stuff...

05:53.103 --> 05:55.196
especially for a chance
to meet Inez Stuart.

05:55.272 --> 05:59.106
No plainclothes. Come dressed
as a famous person from the '20s.

06:00.177 --> 06:01.269
What? Like who?

06:01.345 --> 06:03.176
Hey, wait a minute,
who are you going to be?

06:03.614 --> 06:04.876
Bye, guy.

06:09.086 --> 06:10.485
Inez Stuart.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.223
<i>I had four hours to
cover all of Higgins' bases.</i>

06:14.291 --> 06:16.282
<i>At least, according to Plan A.</i>

06:16.360 --> 06:19.295
<i>So there were a few
early arrivals. No panic.</i>

06:19.363 --> 06:21.058
<i>I had chefs to cook...</i>

06:21.131 --> 06:24.498
<i>servants to serve
and T.C. to cover security.</i>

06:24.601 --> 06:27.434
<i>All I had to do was
smile quietly at these...</i>

06:27.504 --> 06:30.064
<i>sedate sophisticates
and stay awake.</i>

06:30.240 --> 06:31.366
<i>Cakewalk.</i>

06:31.975 --> 06:33.875
**

06:46.090 --> 06:47.318
Excuse me!

06:48.692 --> 06:50.091
Excuse me!

06:51.595 --> 06:54.359
You the caterers?
Just kidding.

06:54.531 --> 06:56.089
I beg your pardon?

06:57.701 --> 07:00.568
What's going on here?
A duel.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.901
Well, I can see that.
Who are they?

07:03.507 --> 07:06.442
Douglas Fairbanks
and John Barrymore.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.586
Three deaths to one.

07:18.255 --> 07:20.223
John Barrymore leads.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.321
They're just acting out
their Gatsby roles...

07:25.396 --> 07:28.559
until someone explains why we're
here and why nothing's ready.

07:28.632 --> 07:30.156
I'm Archer Hayes.

07:30.501 --> 07:33.231
I was going to be Picasso
for the weekend, but...

07:33.404 --> 07:34.598
You must be Higgins.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.229
No, Thomas Magnum.

07:36.306 --> 07:38.240
Higgins is
temporarily indisposed...

07:38.308 --> 07:40.708
and nothing is ready
because you're all early.

07:40.778 --> 07:42.712
No one was supposed to
be here until 2:00.

07:42.780 --> 07:46.113
The invitation reads
9:00 a. m.

07:47.484 --> 07:50.317
Robin's secretary was
kind enough to invite us in...

07:50.387 --> 07:52.446
and point us in the
direction of the bar.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.286
She's here?
What's she doing here?

07:54.358 --> 07:56.189
Robin's in Greece,
finishing a novel.

07:56.260 --> 08:00.253
Oh, she informed us that he
is writing, but not in Greece.

08:00.330 --> 08:01.820
He's upstairs.

08:02.666 --> 08:05.897
Far too busy to
greet his guests.

08:07.371 --> 08:08.565
Excuse me.

08:11.809 --> 08:15.677
Guys, could I get through?
Thanks!

08:16.880 --> 08:18.939
Now, be careful please.

08:25.289 --> 08:26.847
Excuse me.

08:33.397 --> 08:36.889
It's all right. She's my
wife. Oh, I am. No kidding.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.292
Great costume.

08:40.404 --> 08:43.134
This isn't a costume. Really?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.502
You wear that shirt in public?

08:44.575 --> 08:45.940
Nolan.

08:46.009 --> 08:48.273
I'm F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Thomas Magnum.

08:48.345 --> 08:51.712
And this is my wife, Zelda.
Yes, for the weekend, anyway.

08:52.149 --> 08:54.743
Oh, I don't mean I'm his wife
for the weekend. I mean...

08:54.818 --> 08:56.877
we're Scott and Zelda
for the weekend and-

08:56.954 --> 08:58.353
I got it.
Yeah, some weekend.

08:58.422 --> 09:01.118
You know, we don't even know which
rooms we're supposed to be in.

09:01.191 --> 09:02.317
There's been
a slight mix-up...

09:02.392 --> 09:03.859
but I'm gonna take care
of that right now.

09:04.061 --> 09:05.392
I hope to hell so.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.062
So do I.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.030
Please tell me you're Magnum.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.128
Please tell me what's going on.

09:11.735 --> 09:13.965
May I speak to you in private?

09:17.040 --> 09:20.339
Hey, give Robin a message
from Nolan Atherton.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.878
Even for him, this is
pretty lousy treatment.

09:22.946 --> 09:24.709
I mean, for
a $10,000 donation each...

09:24.781 --> 09:27.011
he should at least be willing to
come out and talk to his guests!

09:27.317 --> 09:30.047
Magnum, where have you been? I have
been looking everywhere for you.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.710
Where's Higgins?
Wait a minute, wait.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.278
You mean, Robin is really-

09:33.357 --> 09:35.154
I'm Valerie Kane,
his new assistant.

09:35.225 --> 09:36.920
Oh, what happened to
the funny little lady...

09:36.994 --> 09:39.462
with the support stockings?
Lousy shorthand.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.192
Magnum, please, you've got to do
something about all these VIPs.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.359
I've been going crazy-
I'm gonna straighten it out.

09:44.434 --> 09:47.460
I'll straighten it out. I
just wanna talk to Robin first.

09:47.538 --> 09:49.836
Are you serious, with
that sign on the door?

09:57.080 --> 09:58.604
But...

09:59.683 --> 10:00.911
This is an emergency.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.815
Did anybody tell him
about Higgins' accident?

10:02.886 --> 10:05.548
That he got a concussion?
No one told us anything.

10:05.622 --> 10:09.183
The Athertons arrived at the gate about
two hours ago and then the others.

10:09.259 --> 10:10.954
But Robin said not to
bother him with it...

10:11.028 --> 10:12.962
that you and Higgins would
take care of everything.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.794
The Athertons.
Scott and Zelda, right?

10:16.567 --> 10:19.695
Magnum, don't you know your
guests by their real names?

10:19.770 --> 10:22.466
Nolan Atherton is this week's
best-selling novelist.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.666
I know who they are,
I did my homework.

10:24.741 --> 10:27.539
I just didn't know they'd get
here five hours early, that's all.

10:27.611 --> 10:30.045
You're responsible for
a lot of famous people here.

10:30.113 --> 10:32.308
This is one of the biggest
social events of the season.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.613
I know that! So why is Robin
in there instead of downstairs?

10:35.686 --> 10:39.281
Please. Not right now.
He's on a roll.

10:39.656 --> 10:41.556
He'll understand.
This is important.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.115
So is his book.

10:43.193 --> 10:45.821
He's had a big block
on this new novel for weeks.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.456
Then this morning on the plane
it all came together for him.

10:48.532 --> 10:50.898
But at the moment,
the only thing on his mind...

10:50.968 --> 10:52.595
is meeting his deadline.

10:52.669 --> 10:55.695
I will tell him about the
accident the minute he buzzes me.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.271
You won't forget?

10:58.208 --> 10:59.402
I promise.

11:07.517 --> 11:09.417
Oh, and, Magnum...

11:10.854 --> 11:12.446
why don't you call me Valerie?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.181
Miss Kane sounds like
you're addressing...

11:14.257 --> 11:16.953
that funny little lady
with the support stockings.

11:17.461 --> 11:18.792
You'll let me know
as soon as you talk-

11:20.998 --> 11:22.693
To Robin. Excuse me.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.798
Excuse me.

11:26.169 --> 11:29.468
"Since I am
crept in favor with myself

11:29.539 --> 11:32.565
"I will maintain me
at some little cost.

11:33.143 --> 11:35.270
"Shine out, fair sun...

11:35.345 --> 11:37.313
"till I have found a glass-"
Higgins!

11:37.381 --> 11:39.611
And here I always take
a dramatic pause...

11:39.683 --> 11:40.911
and a deep breath.

11:41.018 --> 11:44.715
"That I may see my shadow
as I pass"

11:47.557 --> 11:50.151
Higgins, cut it out! The
playacting is for the guests.

11:50.227 --> 11:51.319
Higgins?

11:51.561 --> 11:54.394
My ignorant lad,
that was <i>Richard III.</i>

11:54.631 --> 11:57.293
G.B. Shaw begged me to do
the <i>Pygmalion</i> role...

11:57.367 --> 11:59.733
but, of course,
I've no time for comedy.

11:59.870 --> 12:02.668
Higgins, come on. Stop kidding
around and get back to bed!

12:02.739 --> 12:05.071
Back! Back, rogue!

12:05.175 --> 12:08.508
"Onward for God, England
and Saint George!"

12:09.646 --> 12:12.080
Fearing, darling,
that was wonderful.

12:12.416 --> 12:13.974
Wait a minute. Fearing?

12:14.051 --> 12:16.281
Even a resident of
these backward islands...

12:16.353 --> 12:18.184
must know this profile.

12:19.456 --> 12:21.515
I am Sir Fearing Pangborn...

12:21.892 --> 12:23.985
the world's greatest
tragedian...

12:24.761 --> 12:26.422
on continuous tour.

12:36.139 --> 12:39.267
And that, my friends,
is three deaths to two!

12:40.043 --> 12:42.841
"Come, for the
third, Laertes; You but dally

12:42.913 --> 12:45.973
"I pray you, pass
with your best violence

12:46.049 --> 12:48.745
"I am afeard
you make a wanton of me.

12:49.286 --> 12:51.550
"How does the Queen?"
The Queen, Higgins?

12:51.621 --> 12:53.213
"O, villainy!"

12:53.290 --> 12:55.724
"Ho! Let the door be lock'd
Treachery!"

13:04.501 --> 13:06.469
Brilliant performance...

13:06.970 --> 13:09.200
but exhausting.

13:21.335 --> 13:24.827
Rick, you look
so cute. I look stupid.

13:25.773 --> 13:27.297
You don't look stupid.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.706
I just don't know why you
decided to come as Adolf Hitler.

13:29.777 --> 13:31.369
He wasn't that well known
in the '20s.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.379
I'm Charlie Chaplin.

13:33.914 --> 13:37.315
Hey, man, I was just joking.
Where's your sense of humor?

13:37.418 --> 13:39.181
I seem to have lost it
about an hour ago...

13:39.253 --> 13:40.652
when Thomas called
and insisted...

13:40.721 --> 13:42.279
that he needed us again!

13:42.356 --> 13:45.018
I do. This is serious, guys!

13:45.259 --> 13:46.283
Uh-huh.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.693
Higgins running around in a curtain
doing Shakespeare's greatest hits.

13:49.763 --> 13:52.698
He's a sick man,
T.C. He could've killed that guy.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.860
Okay, okay. Who are you
supposed to be, anyway? Othello?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.331
Othello?

13:58.172 --> 14:01.608
Paul Robeson did not get his role
in <i>Othello</i> until the '40s.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.769
I am the Emperor Jones.
Oh.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.545
What?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.382
I feel much better. You
look even dumber than me.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.182
I happen to be a famous
genius from the '20s.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.190
Thomas Edison?
Dashiell Hammett.

14:22.463 --> 14:25.762
Dashiell, the guy who wrote Sam
Spade, he put shoe polish on his head?

14:27.368 --> 14:31.304
He wrote <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>
and he was famous for his white hair.

14:31.372 --> 14:34.637
I did the best I could. I'm glad
you guys find this so amusing.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.974
We got a real security problem here.
I thought I could count on you guys to help.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.843
We're going to help.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.673
No, no, really, really,
we are going to help.

14:45.386 --> 14:46.978
Are you through?

14:50.858 --> 14:54.021
Now, there are two guests in particular
I need you to keep an eye on.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.119
Inez Stuart?
No.

14:56.263 --> 15:00.597
Lady Cynthia Warrington-Stout is
wearing over $1 million in diamonds...

15:00.667 --> 15:03.431
and Archer Hayes is following
her around all the time.

15:03.504 --> 15:04.869
Who is Archer Hayes?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.200
That's what I'd like to know.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.071
Everybody else on the guest
list is famous, but him.

15:09.143 --> 15:12.010
He's dressed like Picasso.
So just watch him, okay?

15:13.647 --> 15:14.978
What's that star for?

15:16.717 --> 15:18.514
Fearing Pangborn.

15:19.553 --> 15:22.078
Oh, my god. Fearing!

15:22.423 --> 15:24.618
Fearing? Fearing what?

15:24.691 --> 15:25.919
Magnum.
Higgins.

15:25.993 --> 15:29.895
What on earth is going on? And
why are Rick and T.C. in costume?

15:30.564 --> 15:32.725
Sorry, Higgins,
but we've got to go.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.027
Don't want Cynthia to lose
the family jewels.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.729
Just a moment,
why are you in costume?

15:36.804 --> 15:38.101
Thomas will explain everything.

15:38.172 --> 15:39.935
I certainly hope so.

15:40.007 --> 15:43.499
Magnum, surely you didn't have the
audacity to invite them to the Gatsby Gala.

15:43.577 --> 15:44.703
Mr. Masters would
be furious.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.575
They're here to lend me
a hand while you're sick.

15:46.647 --> 15:48.239
And you are.
You should be in bed.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.250
If you're referring to the unfortunate
incident with the explosives...

15:51.318 --> 15:53.013
my most serious wound
is simple embarrassment.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.145
Otherwise, I'm fine.
No, you don't understand.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.315
Fine, except for the fact that
you've left me in a most...

15:57.391 --> 15:59.052
delicate and difficult
situation.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.254
Why in heaven's name didn't you notify
me when the guests arrived early?

16:02.329 --> 16:04.388
Well, why in heaven's name
didn't you tell me...

16:04.465 --> 16:06.194
they were arriving early
in the first place?

16:06.266 --> 16:07.494
How would I know?

16:07.568 --> 16:11.436
It's the prerogative of the rich
to arrive when and if they see fit.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.205
Then you didn't send out
revised invitations?

16:14.274 --> 16:16.105
Magnum, I'm very busy
placating the guests.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.007
Now, will you please send
Rick and T.C. away...

16:18.078 --> 16:21.536
and assume the character of a
reasonably competent security person?

16:21.615 --> 16:23.810
Only you and I
will know you're acting.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.716
What on earth have you done to
your hair? You look ridiculous.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.987
I'm Dashiell Hammett!

16:35.863 --> 16:39.765
Magnum, in the '20s, Hammett had very
white, very distinguished sideburns.

16:39.900 --> 16:43.028
His hair was not laminated.

16:43.971 --> 16:48.135
If you want to look authentic, I suggest
you remove that goop and start over.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.037
Miss Stuart?
Miss Stuart?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.137
Yes?

17:23.810 --> 17:25.641
Miss Inez Stuart.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.348
I'm Paul Robeson.

17:31.018 --> 17:34.146
Well, in that case,
I am Josephine Baker.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.712
Oh, no, no,
you're definitely Inez.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.690
Look, Miss Stuart, I...

17:40.027 --> 17:42.257
My sister, my twin sister...

17:42.329 --> 17:45.298
Yeah, she was one of your biggest
fans when you were dancing...

17:45.365 --> 17:48.766
and I was just wondering
if you...

17:50.304 --> 17:52.329
What's your sister's name?
T.C.

17:54.608 --> 17:59.307
That's short for Thelma
Catherine. She just goes by T.C.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.208
To T.C.

18:01.615 --> 18:03.378
Love...

18:03.483 --> 18:06.646
Inez Stuart.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.482
There you are.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.958
Well, I finally got...

18:13.193 --> 18:14.888
I mean, my sister's
gonna go crazy...

18:14.962 --> 18:18.921
when she finds out that I have
gotten the autograph of Inez Stuart.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.091
T.C.!

18:24.571 --> 18:28.200
We sometimes both go by T.C. It
gets confusing on birthday presents.

18:28.976 --> 18:30.466
I can imagine.

18:33.347 --> 18:34.644
Bye.

18:36.717 --> 18:37.843
What the hell do you want?

18:37.918 --> 18:40.284
You made me look stupid
in front of the Inez Stuart.

18:40.354 --> 18:41.787
Just forget the dancer,
will you...

18:41.855 --> 18:43.914
and help me find that old
Lady Warrington-Stout broad.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.081
The one with all the diamonds.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.787
I've been looking all over the
joint for her and I can't find her.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.387
That's okay, that's okay. I've
been keeping an eye on her.

18:51.465 --> 18:52.796
She's right over there.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.699
That's her?

18:57.337 --> 18:59.771
See, just relax.
I'll handle this.

19:04.111 --> 19:06.136
Well, it seems
like a very straightforward...

19:06.213 --> 19:07.407
uncomplicated question to me.

19:07.481 --> 19:10.746
Yes, and I shall be
just as uncomplicated in answering.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.684
Pardon me. Lady Stout?
Yes.

19:13.754 --> 19:17.087
May I have a word with
you in private? All right.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.392
Thank you.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.556
I thought you should know
that I'm not a regular guest.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.895
I'm a chief security officer assigned
to protect your many valuables.

19:27.501 --> 19:31.028
No, you must be mistaken. You see,
I already have my own bodyguard.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.299
No, no, no, please. You
see, I have a job to do.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.433
This weekend, wherever
you go, I go. Come on.

19:37.878 --> 19:40.244
All right,
I'm going to the beach.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.868
Have you been protecting
my things? What? Oh, yeah.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.066
Everything is right here.

20:07.140 --> 20:11.201
Your dress, your diamonds.
I'm on the job.

20:11.845 --> 20:14.075
But it kept you
from having a swim.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.477
No, I don't have
any trunks anyway.

20:18.285 --> 20:21.311
Lady Cynthia, that's not exactly
a 1920 bathing suit, is it?

20:22.522 --> 20:25.980
Hardly, no. I go along
with this Gatsby thing just-

20:26.059 --> 20:29.222
Yeah, when you've got...
What I mean is...

20:29.796 --> 20:33.061
Well, modern bathing suits,
a lot more safer.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.963
Gee, I say everything
wrong when I...

20:36.036 --> 20:38.971
I get so tongue-tied
when I really like somebody.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.374
I think it's refreshing.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.507
You do?
Mmm-hmm.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.680
We'd better be getting back. There's
something I need to take care of.

20:51.752 --> 20:52.810
What?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.845
It doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.583
Lady Cynthia, I-

21:21.112 --> 21:24.811
Sorry, but you look like a
pair of Pat Boone's old shoes.

21:24.885 --> 21:26.614
Would you forget about
my hair, all right?

21:26.686 --> 21:29.280
I was trying to make distinguished,
white sideburns and I...

21:29.356 --> 21:30.914
Valerie, just buzz Robin!

21:30.991 --> 21:34.859
I did. I explained to him about Higgins
and how upset the guests were...

21:34.928 --> 21:37.590
but I got the same answer,
don't bother him.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.757
Miss Kane.
What happened to Valerie?

21:39.833 --> 21:42.666
What happened to Robin? Deadlines
are not that important to the man!

21:42.736 --> 21:45.534
He has never met one. Now, are you
going to open that door open or am I?

21:45.605 --> 21:46.970
It's your neck.

21:48.074 --> 21:52.443
Robin? Robin, no, wait! It's Magnum!
He says it's absolutely urgent that...

21:53.313 --> 21:54.541
Robin?

21:59.419 --> 22:02.252
Look, why don't you just
leave him a note?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.122
No! Magnum, wait!

22:04.190 --> 22:07.023
He will really get upset
if you go in there. Please.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.989
Where in heaven's name
have you been, Morgan?

22:12.232 --> 22:15.201
I'm not in the habit of having
to search for my dresser.

22:15.268 --> 22:18.431
Your incompetence may very well
have made me late for my matinee.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.470
Where is my transportation
to the theatre?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.566
Excuse me.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.305
Excuse you.

22:27.047 --> 22:30.915
Such beauty may be excused
the sins of the ages.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.813
Fearing, this is Valerie Kane.

22:34.888 --> 22:38.119
Valerie, this is Fearing
Pangborn. Sir Fearing Pangborn.

22:38.258 --> 22:41.523
Sir Fearing Pangborn, the
world's greatest tragedian.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.323
On continuous tour.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.423
Come, lovely creature
and sit with me on the couch.

22:46.499 --> 22:50.060
I shall grant you the interview
that I know your readers crave.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.063
Oh, no, I'm not a reporter.

22:53.740 --> 22:58.336
And I am not a great actor. We
shall both tell lover's lies.

22:58.778 --> 22:59.836
Fearing.

23:00.213 --> 23:03.114
Yes, Morgan?
It's Magnum!

23:03.383 --> 23:04.748
What's in a name?

23:05.251 --> 23:07.685
Now, my dear,
where shall we begin?

23:07.754 --> 23:09.585
I realize it's
a difficult question...

23:09.656 --> 23:12.420
when confronted with a life
as fascinating as mine.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.695
Fearing. You're late
for your matinee, remember?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.090
True.

23:19.265 --> 23:23.702
But never fear, my fawning beauty.
You shall have your interview.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.864
You'll come to my room after
this evening's performance.

23:26.940 --> 23:30.341
We'll talk over dinner
late into the night.

23:30.410 --> 23:34.642
Fearing, your taxi's waiting
to take you to the theatre.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.012
Your audience is trembling
with anticipation.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.448
So am I.

23:39.953 --> 23:43.946
Farewell, my dear,
until this evening.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.695
Come to the room
with the star on the door.

23:51.798 --> 23:56.531
We'll talk through the night and
at the dawn turn as one and say:

23:56.669 --> 23:59.365
"What light
through yonder window breaks?"

24:08.048 --> 24:10.573
Higgins?
No.

24:10.884 --> 24:14.650
Fearing Pangborn in Higgins'
body and Robin's smoking jacket.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.121
Look, I'd better go get him to
bed before he scares somebody else.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.982
I'll be back. I hope you'll
be around at dinnertime.

24:20.193 --> 24:23.185
I mean, in case the amorous
Fearing shows up again.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.991
There you are! Well, call
the cops, Mr. Security.

24:29.069 --> 24:32.368
Charlie Chaplin just stole
$20,000 from my room!

24:33.773 --> 24:38.073
Atherton, that's not possible. Rick is
here helping me with security this weekend.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.444
Some security. Well, what were
you doing with that kind of cash?

24:41.514 --> 24:44.574
Don't change the subject. Are
you gonna call the cops or am I?

24:45.218 --> 24:47.379
Yoo-hoo, Nolan.
Where have you been?

24:47.454 --> 24:50.890
Fixing a drink.
I didn't think you'd notice.

24:51.291 --> 24:53.316
When was the last time
you saw the money?

24:53.393 --> 24:55.793
This morning.
$20,000 in $100 bills.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.989
And who else knows the
money's missing? Everybody.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.931
You think I'm going to keep
quiet about a thing like this?

25:01.534 --> 25:03.024
Your friend took it, all right.

25:03.103 --> 25:05.469
He's been skulking around in
the halls with those baggy pants.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.665
Very convenient for hiding
all that money.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.573
Now, call the cops!
Oh, Nolan, please.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.443
You bring them into this, we get the
press as well. Just leave it alone.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.039
You were gonna give
the money away, anyway.

25:17.117 --> 25:20.883
Don't you think a check would have been
simpler for your donation this weekend?

25:20.954 --> 25:24.287
Oh, well, you see, Scott and Zelda
liked dealing in cash, so we thought-

25:24.357 --> 25:26.450
Look, never mind all that.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.494
Your security man took it!
No, I didn't!

25:29.562 --> 25:30.722
Hey, tell him to back off!

25:30.797 --> 25:33.391
Here's your little sneak thief. I
found him in Lady Cynthia's room.

25:33.466 --> 25:35.525
He's accusing me of stealing
$20,000! Now, tell him who I am.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.762
I know who you are.
What I don't know...

25:36.836 --> 25:37.962
is what you're doing
in Lady Cynthia's-

25:38.037 --> 25:40.528
Archer, that's enough! Rick'll explain
what he was doing in her room...

25:40.607 --> 25:42.700
when you explain why you
were following her around.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.801
I'm her private bodyguard. She'll
verify it, when we find her.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.710
Some bodyguard. Thomas,
I don't know where she is.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.077
I went in her room
to check on her...

25:49.149 --> 25:50.582
and this wild man here
jumps with...

25:50.650 --> 25:52.709
some stupid crack
about me stealing $20,000.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.082
Yeah, my money!
Where is it?

25:54.154 --> 25:57.248
Look, if you really are her security
man, why aren't you doing your job?

25:57.323 --> 25:59.917
She was never out of my sight
until she went into her room.

25:59.993 --> 26:02.621
This drooling Chaplin
seemed harmless enough.

26:02.695 --> 26:05.493
Now, just a minute-
Rick, Rick. Come on.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.896
She's probably upstairs
in the bathroom or something.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.367
Waste your time if you like.
I'm gonna check the grounds.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.030
Now, hold on, the lady can
wait! What about my money?

26:15.441 --> 26:17.602
"O ill-starr'd wench!"

26:17.977 --> 26:19.672
"Pale as thy smock!"

26:20.813 --> 26:22.974
"When we shall meet at compt."

26:23.516 --> 26:28.146
"This look of thine will
hurl my soul from heaven"

26:28.454 --> 26:31.048
"and fiends will snatch at it."

26:31.124 --> 26:34.389
Fearing, what are you doing?
You have a matinee, remember?

26:34.460 --> 26:38.726
I am doing the matinee, you
fool. Now, go away, Morgan.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.631
Fearing, no. You're not in.
- Please.

26:42.435 --> 26:47.236
"Cold, cold, my girl!
Even like thy chastity."

26:49.375 --> 26:51.866
"O! Cursed slave."

26:52.011 --> 26:55.811
"Whip me, ye devils From the
possession of this heavenly sight!"

26:55.915 --> 26:57.610
"Blow me about in winds!"

26:57.684 --> 26:59.549
"Roast me in sulphur!"

26:59.652 --> 27:03.782
"Wash me in steep-down gulfs
of liquid fire!"

27:03.957 --> 27:06.118
"O Desdemona!"

27:06.292 --> 27:08.886
"Desdemona! Dead!"

27:08.995 --> 27:13.591
"Oh! Oh! Oh!"

27:14.334 --> 27:16.859
"An honorable murderer,
if you will."

27:16.936 --> 27:19.302
"For nought I did in hate"

27:19.372 --> 27:21.863
"but all in honor."

27:30.183 --> 27:31.411
Okay, come on, folks...

27:31.484 --> 27:33.213
please give us some room.
Come on.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.378
No deals, Magnum.

27:36.456 --> 27:38.390
Come on, Lieutenant.
We're talking about Higgins.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.392
Do you honestly think
he's capable of murder?

27:40.460 --> 27:43.588
Somebody's trying to set him up. I
just need some time to figure out who.

27:43.663 --> 27:44.925
I can't.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.365
So long, Magnum.

27:47.433 --> 27:51.062
Reports to file and I haven't
slept in nearly two days.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.332
Me, either.
Lieutenant...

27:53.673 --> 27:56.665
How many of those Agatha
Christies did you watch?

27:57.644 --> 28:01.808
Five. I missed the first one. Didn't
get out of the office until quiet late.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.040
I've got it.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.118
Huh?
First one.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.846
I got it on tape.

28:08.488 --> 28:10.149
Here it is.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.451
I suppose,
I could loan it to you.

28:17.497 --> 28:19.658
They have a machine
at the station.

28:19.732 --> 28:23.259
Yeah, but you'll be so busy
filling out all those reports.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.669
Two hours.
Deal!

28:28.875 --> 28:31.537
When I bring this back,
I'm bringing a warrant.

28:31.611 --> 28:34.910
In the meantime, my men
are posted outside the gates.

28:35.515 --> 28:38.973
And nobody leaves.
Right.

28:40.186 --> 28:43.178
I demand to know why I
wasn't allowed to talk to the police.

28:43.256 --> 28:46.384
Archer, he'll be back. He'll
take statements from everybody.

28:46.559 --> 28:50.723
I'm warning you, this cover-up for Higgins
will be duly noted to the authorities.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.925
We don't even know yet if it was
murder. There were no marks on the body.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.262
How nice of you to tell me that.

28:55.335 --> 28:58.429
Perhaps you could also tell me why
I wasn't allowed to examine the body.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.735
I think you should take that up with
Lieutenant Tanaka when he comes back.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.832
You bet I will.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.707
I have some interesting things to
tell him about your friend Rick...

29:05.778 --> 29:07.712
or have you already
informed the police...

29:07.780 --> 29:10.510
that he was found with
his hand in the money jar?

29:10.583 --> 29:13.347
I don't have to answer to you. You
got a problem, talk to the police.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.887
In the meantime, I have
an investigation to run.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.050
Magnum?

29:20.126 --> 29:23.186
Why wasn't Higgins arrested?
For what?

29:23.363 --> 29:26.799
Playing Othello? I told you, they
don't actually have a crime yet.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.763
What about Lady Cynthia's
missing jewels?

29:29.869 --> 29:32.030
Well, they certainly didn't
find them in Higgins' room.

29:32.939 --> 29:37.308
Is there any law against me
continuing the search?

29:37.977 --> 29:38.966
No.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.372
Thanks.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.528
<i>I had to accept the
fact that Fearing Pangborn...</i>

30:06.606 --> 30:08.369
<i>could have gotten carried away.</i>

30:08.441 --> 30:11.239
<i>But somewhere in all that
madness, he was still Higgins...</i>

30:11.310 --> 30:13.073
<i>with Higgins' conscience.</i>

30:13.146 --> 30:15.410
<i>A conscience that I was
convinced would stop him...</i>

30:15.481 --> 30:17.972
<i>short of doing any harm
to a defenseless girl.</i>

30:18.317 --> 30:20.945
<i>So if he didn't do it,
he was set up.</i>

30:21.287 --> 30:24.984
<i>But by whom?
Any suggestions, Miss Marple?</i>

30:25.091 --> 30:26.991
<i>It simply can't
be true about the Colonel.</i>

30:27.059 --> 30:29.289
<i>I've known him for 45 years.</i>

30:29.896 --> 30:32.558
Are you so shocked
that he has enemies?

30:32.665 --> 30:34.997
Frankly, I never thought
of such a man...

30:35.067 --> 30:36.295
having friend or a foe.

30:36.369 --> 30:37.927
Donald, are you suggesting-

30:38.004 --> 30:39.096
Suggesting? No, my dear...

30:39.172 --> 30:41.106
I am merely stating a fact
that the Colonel is...

30:41.174 --> 30:44.166
deeply resented in certain
important circles.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.874
<i>A resentment strong
enough to wish him harm?</i>

30:48.047 --> 30:49.878
<i>Perhaps we should change
the subject.</i>

30:49.949 --> 30:51.109
No!

30:51.184 --> 30:54.017
<i>Please go on, you
think that someone has actually...</i>

30:54.086 --> 30:56.850
<i>planned the Colonel's downfall?</i>

30:57.323 --> 31:00.690
<i>I think that
deep wounds heal very slowly.</i>

31:01.327 --> 31:02.589
<i>More tea?</i>

31:07.033 --> 31:09.627
Thanks guys,
let's get some rest.

31:13.706 --> 31:14.695
Thomas.

31:14.807 --> 31:18.004
T.C., I am about to clear the
name of Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.807
That's great. Can you do
anything for Fearing Pangborn?

31:20.880 --> 31:24.247
"But were
I Brutus And Brutus Antony..."

31:24.317 --> 31:27.912
"there were an Antony Would
ruffle up your spirits..."

31:27.987 --> 31:31.514
"and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar..."

31:31.591 --> 31:34.389
"that should move
The stones of Rome..."

31:34.460 --> 31:37.293
"to rise and mutiny."

31:37.363 --> 31:39.024
Isn't there something
you can do about this?

31:39.098 --> 31:41.123
The man is acting
as if nothing has happened.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.395
We'll take care of it,
Miss Stuart.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.061
Come on, Magnum.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.741
Fearing, you have to stop.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.111
Morgan, please.

31:53.813 --> 31:56.304
For my encore selection...
Fearing!

31:56.382 --> 32:00.614
The role of Macbeth,
Act 2, Scene 1! Fearing!

32:01.254 --> 32:02.585
We've got to get him
back to his room.

32:02.655 --> 32:06.113
"Is this a dagger
which I see before me?"

32:16.802 --> 32:18.201
Critics.

32:39.892 --> 32:41.450
Hi!

32:43.763 --> 32:47.028
You're not even breathing hard. No.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.469
Oh, I'm sorry, do you generally
provoke that response in women?

32:52.538 --> 32:54.301
Let me see your legs.
Let you what?

32:54.373 --> 32:57.365
Just stick them out there,
where I can see them.

33:01.447 --> 33:05.679
You really do miss that funny little lady
with the support stockings, don't you?

33:10.222 --> 33:14.215
Somebody in a Chaplin outfit
just tried to kill Higgins.

33:15.094 --> 33:18.461
Valerie, I think it's time you
told me what you were doing here.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.456
I'm working for Robin.

33:21.601 --> 33:23.364
Well, suppose we ask him that.

33:23.569 --> 33:28.063
Magnum, I'm sorry, he left. I
don't know what's gotten into him.

33:28.174 --> 33:31.507
He said he was going to
the library. Research.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.841
I didn't believe it, but-
I don't either.

33:33.913 --> 33:35.005
What?

33:40.152 --> 33:44.282
If you knew anything about Robin,
you'd know that he never does research.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.085
He was never here.

33:47.526 --> 33:51.792
I've never met the man,
not even by telephone.

33:55.950 --> 33:59.113
All right, so I told
a couple of little white lies.

33:59.187 --> 34:00.882
It doesn't make me a murderer.

34:00.955 --> 34:04.618
Look, I know you're not going to believe me,
but I was going to tell you the truth.

34:04.692 --> 34:08.958
Okay, not at first, but after I got to know you,
I started feeling like a creep.

34:09.397 --> 34:11.661
I decided that as soon as I
got out of here with my scoop...

34:11.733 --> 34:14.395
I was gonna call you up and I was
gonna tell you the whole truth.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.802
You really expect me to believe you went
to all that trouble just to get a job?

34:18.206 --> 34:21.107
It wasn't just the job!
It was a scoop!

34:21.175 --> 34:24.201
Robin Masters' annual
Great Gatsby Gala...

34:24.445 --> 34:26.879
with all the gossip and
intrigue that goes along with it.

34:26.947 --> 34:29.313
It may sound dumb to you, but the
<i>National Intruder</i> said...

34:29.384 --> 34:32.876
that if I got any gory details,
they'd give me a staff job.

34:35.922 --> 34:38.949
What else have you done that
you haven't told me about?

34:42.630 --> 34:45.224
I was guarding Higgins' door,
somebody hit me from behind.

34:45.299 --> 34:47.766
What?
Well, it wasn't me.

34:48.202 --> 34:49.429
Can I please just leave?

34:49.504 --> 34:52.803
No, I'm afraid not. Right now,
you're a prime murder suspect.

34:52.873 --> 34:56.900
You attacked Cindy?
No! You can't keep me here.

34:57.078 --> 35:00.445
Well, you try and leave, you'll have
to get past Lieutenant Tanaka's men.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.675
I don't know
what happened to Higgins.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.577
Thomas.

35:05.653 --> 35:08.850
Morgan, what is
the meaning of this?

35:08.956 --> 35:11.948
I went in to take my
customary after matinee bath...

35:12.026 --> 35:14.256
and the WC
appeared to be leaking.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.456
Naturally, I couldn't find
you anywhere, as usual.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.990
So, I opened the lid of the
tank and discovered this.

35:21.069 --> 35:22.764
I figured you should know.

35:23.404 --> 35:24.428
Higgins.

35:24.505 --> 35:29.204
Will you kindly tell me what all this
money and jewelry is doing in my bathroom?

35:29.277 --> 35:31.302
Why don't you tell us all?

35:36.250 --> 35:38.411
<i>I figured I still
had about a half an hour...</i>

35:38.486 --> 35:41.478
<i>before Tanaka returned with a
warrant for Higgins' arrest.</i>

35:41.589 --> 35:43.682
<i>I could only hope that,
that would be enough time...</i>

35:43.758 --> 35:47.159
<i>to find the clu</i> e <i>to the "old
woun</i> d <i>that was healing slowly."</i>

35:47.228 --> 35:50.629
You better do something fast. A lot
of people want to get out of here.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.393
Did you know that 11...

35:53.468 --> 35:56.904
of the people here this
weekend have been here before?

35:57.071 --> 35:59.096
Well, Thomas, that's real
interesting, except that this...

35:59.173 --> 36:01.801
isn't exactly the best time
to be gathering trivia.

36:01.876 --> 36:03.366
You think one of them
has a motive?

36:03.444 --> 36:05.537
A handful of them have
had run-ins with Higgins.

36:05.613 --> 36:08.639
The Colonel is deeply
resented in high places.

36:08.716 --> 36:09.705
Who's the Colonel?

36:09.784 --> 36:11.911
This guest register
that Higgins made notes in...

36:11.986 --> 36:13.681
just might contain the clue
to clear him.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.914
Magnum?

36:16.357 --> 36:18.348
What are you doing?
Why are you at the desk?

36:18.426 --> 36:21.259
Nothing, I'm just looking
for something I misplaced.

36:22.330 --> 36:25.766
Yes, well, perhaps if you
tell me what it is, I can...

36:28.469 --> 36:30.300
What on earth are these?

36:30.371 --> 36:32.703
Oh, those are just some invitations
I collected from the guests.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.707
I didn't know what to do
with them, so I put them-

36:34.775 --> 36:37.107
You couldn't possibly
have collected these.

36:39.180 --> 36:41.375
They're over 10 years old.

36:44.352 --> 36:47.185
How odd! They have
today's date on them.

36:50.525 --> 36:53.460
Could I possibly have made
such a mistake?

36:54.929 --> 36:58.660
No, I threw away all of
the Jamison stock years ago.

36:58.733 --> 36:59.757
Jamison?

36:59.834 --> 37:02.530
My predecessor,
Lowell Xavier Jamison.

37:02.603 --> 37:05.572
You see?
Jamison's initials, L.X.J.

37:05.740 --> 37:08.265
The current ones, of course,
have my initials on them.

37:08.342 --> 37:10.936
This guy, Jamison,
what do you know about him?

37:11.012 --> 37:12.877
Well, I never actually
met the man.

37:12.947 --> 37:16.280
If it's important to you, perhaps you
should speak to Mr. Masters about him.

37:16.350 --> 37:19.547
Well, that's great. We all we
know he's somewhere in Greece.

37:19.620 --> 37:21.986
Yes, at the
Kastellian Resort on Crete.

37:22.056 --> 37:25.457
You know where he is?
Well, of course.

37:25.526 --> 37:29.326
Well, I suggest you call him.
Now! Please!

37:32.300 --> 37:34.063
Too late, Magnum.

37:34.769 --> 37:36.930
Your time is up.
Lieutenant.

37:39.473 --> 37:42.465
Did you ever hear about the
case of the Red Faced Thespian?

37:47.648 --> 37:49.673
Well, I suppose...

37:49.750 --> 37:52.150
you're wondering why
I asked you all here?

37:54.755 --> 37:58.191
Everyone here
in this room knows...

37:58.259 --> 38:00.193
that a murder was
committed here this weekend.

38:00.261 --> 38:02.752
One of you knows who did it.

38:04.165 --> 38:06.326
Let's call this caper...

38:06.400 --> 38:08.868
"The Case of
the Red Faced Thespian."

38:09.737 --> 38:14.333
I can't believe you're treating Lady
Cynthia's death in this ridiculous fashion.

38:14.775 --> 38:17.039
Lieutenant, I want to make
a statement of the events...

38:17.111 --> 38:19.306
that have transpired
over these last few hours.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.315
Let's hear him out.
Thank you.

38:25.353 --> 38:29.346
Lieutenant Tanaka is here to
arrest Higgins for the murder...

38:29.624 --> 38:32.491
of Lady Cynthia
Warrington-Stout. But...

38:33.227 --> 38:35.855
is it possible that
someone else is involved?

38:36.097 --> 38:39.555
Someone who might have sent
those revised invitations...

38:39.634 --> 38:42.967
might have stolen the money
and the diamonds, might even...

38:43.337 --> 38:45.464
have gone as far as murder...

38:47.208 --> 38:50.143
just to make Higgins
look incompetent...

38:51.379 --> 38:54.507
appear guilty,
and thus become...

38:55.182 --> 38:56.672
the Red Faced Thespian?

38:56.751 --> 38:59.743
We shall soon find out.
I certainly hope so.

39:00.354 --> 39:04.120
Oh, come on. What possible motive
could anybody - Revenge, Nolan.

39:05.059 --> 39:07.118
You should understand
that, right?

39:10.765 --> 39:12.232
This is the...

39:12.700 --> 39:15.260
Robin's Nest guest register.

39:15.336 --> 39:19.033
All the names of people invited
here, over the last 10 years...

39:19.106 --> 39:23.270
with little personal notations
made after some of the names.

39:23.344 --> 39:26.370
The notations of
Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

39:26.447 --> 39:30.349
See, he knew which of the guests might
have reason to dislike him and why.

39:30.985 --> 39:34.216
Remember,
old wounds heal slowly.

39:34.922 --> 39:36.412
I was never even invited.

39:36.490 --> 39:39.584
Precisely, Valerie,
you're not even in the book.

39:39.660 --> 39:43.926
No visible motive unless I must conclude
that although she is undoubtedly...

39:43.998 --> 39:47.024
guilty of a few character
assassinations in print...

39:47.134 --> 39:49.568
Valerie is probably no murderer.

39:51.172 --> 39:53.606
This is absurd. If you
think I'm going to stay here-

39:53.674 --> 39:55.801
Inez Stuart,
on the other hand...

39:58.679 --> 40:01.876
All right. So I've
been here a few times...

40:02.350 --> 40:04.545
probably written up
in that stupid book.

40:04.618 --> 40:08.952
Let's see, the motive. Yes, I
had a grudge against Higgins!

40:13.694 --> 40:17.562
When the film version of <i>Babes
in Babylon</i> was made...

40:18.499 --> 40:22.492
I begged Robin to let me play the
part of the tempestuous dancer.

40:23.738 --> 40:26.229
But he said
I was wrong for the part.

40:27.274 --> 40:30.209
So, I went to Higgins
with a plan to...

40:30.811 --> 40:35.510
trick Robin to letting me
play the part. He refused.

40:36.083 --> 40:39.382
That movie would have
meant my triumphant comeback.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.983
You're damn right.
I owe that butler one!

40:44.058 --> 40:46.652
But not murder.
You're right.

40:47.128 --> 40:49.790
On hearing a recap
of the incident, would we...

40:50.197 --> 40:53.530
really call this
an old wound healing slowly?

40:54.168 --> 40:55.226
Let's see.

40:55.302 --> 40:58.203
That brings us to...

41:04.545 --> 41:07.105
You're not going to bring up
that ridiculous nonsense...

41:07.181 --> 41:09.308
about the slander suit, are you?

41:10.117 --> 41:13.450
Higgins writes
that Robin made some...

41:14.088 --> 41:18.923
unfortunate public comments about
the quality of your writing...

41:19.527 --> 41:21.688
and about the state of
your marriage to Marge.

41:21.762 --> 41:24.925
So I filed a slander suit.
Which you had to drop.

41:25.699 --> 41:28.964
Because Higgins could verify that
you had been here at the estate...

41:29.036 --> 41:32.472
on a number of occasions
with your protégés.

41:33.607 --> 41:35.507
Clearly a motive for revenge.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.670
Revenge, perhaps.
Murder, hardly.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.443
This is getting
a little tedious, Magnum.

41:44.051 --> 41:46.611
Then there is the question...

41:47.855 --> 41:50.085
of Theodore Calvin.

41:51.192 --> 41:52.216
Huh?

41:52.293 --> 41:55.854
Admit it, T.C., you've never
really gotten along with Higgins.

41:56.163 --> 42:00.429
You're right, man, he's really flipped out.
Just go along with it, I'm short of suspects.

42:00.801 --> 42:04.293
I won't have you desecrate
Lady Cynthia's memory like this.

42:04.872 --> 42:08.103
At last, we hear from Jamison.

42:08.476 --> 42:13.106
Lowell Xavier Jamison,
dismissed by Robin in 1972?

42:14.348 --> 42:19.047
And replaced by the totally
incompetent Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

42:21.889 --> 42:23.516
When did you find out?

42:23.591 --> 42:26.424
About you being Jamison?
Oh, just now, for sure.

42:26.494 --> 42:29.759
But I talked to Robin on the
phone about an hour ago and he...

42:29.830 --> 42:32.025
filled me in
on your general appearance...

42:32.299 --> 42:35.097
and of your contempt
for him and Higgins.

42:35.402 --> 42:38.394
He said he lost track of you
about six years ago...

42:38.506 --> 42:42.465
around the same time you went to
work for Lady Cynthia as Archer Hayes.

42:44.345 --> 42:48.406
Yes, I wanted to make
Higgins look bad.

42:48.482 --> 42:49.744
I admit that.

42:50.317 --> 42:53.218
I stole the money
and the jewels.

42:54.755 --> 42:56.620
But I didn't kill her.

43:00.127 --> 43:03.995
I sneaked into Higgins'
bathroom to plant the jewels.

43:04.431 --> 43:06.865
I heard a noise
in the bedroom, a scuffle.

43:07.735 --> 43:12.035
I thought someone was on to me, so I
waited till I thought they were gone.

43:12.606 --> 43:14.597
And when I came out...

43:15.709 --> 43:17.472
there she was...

43:18.579 --> 43:20.547
lifeless on the bed.

43:21.715 --> 43:25.242
But I didn't kill her.
I didn't.

43:26.053 --> 43:27.714
Of course, you didn't.

43:29.323 --> 43:32.315
You could never have done that. No!

43:33.160 --> 43:35.355
Which brings us...

43:36.597 --> 43:37.996
to Marge.

43:38.265 --> 43:41.462
Old wounds?
You can't be alive!

43:42.102 --> 43:43.296
You can't.

43:45.205 --> 43:48.504
She and Nolan were having an
affair! No, we weren't.

43:48.709 --> 43:52.042
I admit he propositioned me,
but I wasn't going to accept.

43:52.112 --> 43:53.909
I don't believe you.

43:54.014 --> 43:56.608
I was resting
before confronting him...

43:56.984 --> 43:59.282
when I realized
someone was in my room.

43:59.853 --> 44:04.415
I opened my eyes slightly and I saw
someone in a Chaplin outfit slipping out.

44:04.858 --> 44:08.419
That was me, with your
diamonds. I was curious.

44:08.662 --> 44:12.154
So I followed him to Higgins' room, but
before I could find out who it was...

44:12.232 --> 44:14.530
someone hit me over
the head with something.

44:14.602 --> 44:16.593
That would be Marge.
See...

44:16.904 --> 44:18.804
the way I figure it...

44:18.872 --> 44:22.706
Marge saw Cynthia and Nolan together,
followed Cynthia to her room...

44:22.776 --> 44:25.108
but had to wait to attack her...

44:25.179 --> 44:27.306
because Archer was dressed
in a Charlie Chaplin outfit-

44:27.381 --> 44:28.575
Magnum.

44:28.649 --> 44:30.276
Wait. No, this all
makes sense, see.

44:30.351 --> 44:32.182
Archer came out
of Cynthia's room...

44:32.252 --> 44:36.086
Cynthia followed Archer, Marge followed
Cynthia and hit her over the head.

44:36.156 --> 44:39.182
Who threw the dagger?
Archer. Jamison.

44:39.326 --> 44:41.419
I was certain that Higgins
had killed Cynthia...

44:41.495 --> 44:43.429
and I knew you'd cover up
for him. I was desperate.

44:43.497 --> 44:46.193
I couldn't let him get away
with it! That's attempted murder.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.631
So is this!

44:47.735 --> 44:50.670
Marge, you're not going
to pull a gun. How trite.

44:52.573 --> 44:54.666
I can't take it!

44:54.842 --> 44:56.207
I can't take it!

44:56.276 --> 44:59.404
You don't know what it's like
to be lied to. This is great!

44:59.513 --> 45:03.074
To be humiliated, to be.
- "Or not to be..."

45:03.283 --> 45:05.080
"That is the question."

45:05.152 --> 45:07.814
A drama in progress.
How delightful.

45:07.888 --> 45:09.150
Higgins, get down!

45:09.223 --> 45:13.489
"All the world's a stage And
the men and women merely players."

45:24.238 --> 45:26.172
Oh, my God!

45:29.810 --> 45:31.334
<i>Okay, I admit...</i>

45:31.412 --> 45:34.813
<i>it was fun just once
to do it like Miss Marple.</i>

45:35.049 --> 45:37.950
<i>Marge Atherton and Archer
Hayes were taken into custody.</i>

45:38.018 --> 45:42.011
<i>Valerie decided to save her big scoop for
that novel she always wanted to write.</i>

45:42.189 --> 45:44.783
<i>The other guests
all went home, and Higgins...</i>

45:45.559 --> 45:47.754
<i>went back to being Higgins...</i>

45:47.828 --> 45:49.022
<i>for good.</i>

45:52.566 --> 45:53.828
Higgins.

46:04.745 --> 46:07.509
Higgins, what are you doing?

46:07.581 --> 46:09.412
This is how you got hurt
in the first place.

46:09.483 --> 46:11.917
Magnum, please. The mongeese.
- Mongooses.

46:11.985 --> 46:14.180
Mongooses are still here.

46:14.588 --> 46:17.250
And besides, I never make
the same mistake twice.

46:17.391 --> 46:20.087
I'm quite fine now,
completely recovered.

46:20.928 --> 46:24.386
Well, just don't do any
more of those doubles, okay?

46:28.168 --> 46:29.260
Higgins...

46:30.504 --> 46:33.962
did you ever consider becoming an actor?

46:36.643 --> 46:38.235
My God, no.

46:39.747 --> 46:41.681
What a ridiculous idea.

46:44.118 --> 46:47.087
There was, however, one time. Yes?

46:48.956 --> 46:51.447
A play at Eton when I was 16.

46:51.825 --> 46:55.625
Well, the boy who was playing the leading
role got sick at the last minute and I...

46:55.863 --> 46:58.696
famous for my memory,
was asked to take the part.

46:59.466 --> 47:00.933
Shakespeare, by any chance?

47:02.569 --> 47:03.797
<i>Hamlet.</i>

47:04.905 --> 47:07.567
Such applause, such adulation.

47:10.110 --> 47:14.376
For some reason, the other boys at the
school never seemed to like me very much.

47:14.581 --> 47:18.347
But that night, for the first
time, perhaps the only time...

47:19.319 --> 47:21.378
I felt that they really...

47:26.460 --> 47:30.396
But you must find my
stories very tedious, Morgan.

47:35.269 --> 47:38.170
"O villain, villain..."

47:38.839 --> 47:42.070
"smiling,
damned villain!"
