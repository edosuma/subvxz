00:08.883 --> 00:11.928
Scientists now say there
may be a biological reason that--

00:13.722 --> 00:17.851
<i> Live from WABC7,</i>
<i>you're watching </i>The Morning Show

00:17.934 --> 00:20.645
<i>with Len Huntsman, Gloria Francis,</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:24.816
<i>and Sheila Church</i>
<i>with the exclusive AccuWeather forecast.</i>

00:26.484 --> 00:29.279
<i>Now, here's your eyewitness news.</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:35.910
Good morning, New York City.
It's 6:00 a.m. and 32 degrees out there.

00:35.994 --> 00:36.995
I'm Len Huntsman.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.080
And I'm Gloria Francis.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.500
An unidentified man
was fatally struck by a train

00:42.584 --> 00:45.670
after falling onto the tracks
late last night in Queens.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.965
Authorities say there are
no witnesses to the accident

00:49.049 --> 00:51.760
that happened at the Forest Hill
71st Avenue Station

00:51.843 --> 00:54.637
at approximately 3:05 a.m.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.849
Medics responded, but the victim
was pronounced dead at the scene.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.809
<i>…dead at the scene.</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:41.351
<i>Chia Pets grow in practically no time.</i>

01:41.434 --> 01:42.894
<i>Follow the simple directions.</i>

01:44.145 --> 01:48.149
<i>Add water, and watch your Chia Pet</i>
<i>grow right before your eyes!</i>

01:48.233 --> 01:52.070
<i>Great for decorating.</i>
<i>Use them again and again all year round.</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:55.156
<i>No matter where they're seen.</i>

01:55.240 --> 02:00.787
<i>In a kitchen window, on a table,</i>
<i>a beautiful centerpiece, the office.</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:02.956
<i>Just about anywhere.</i>

02:10.839 --> 02:13.716
<i> Chia Pets make</i>
<i>a perfect gift for you and your friends.</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:17.095
<i>Start growing</i>
<i>your own fun today with Chia Pets.</i>

03:16.863 --> 03:17.989
-Melody.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.192
Beatriz?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.570
The man you saw.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.324
The one that has a message for me.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.910
Who is he?

04:03.993 --> 04:05.662
Is he someone from the building?

04:07.956 --> 04:08.998
Is he dead?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.089
If you could just look one more time.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.298
Please.

04:20.009 --> 04:20.843
No.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.390
No, no, no, no, no.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.474
No!

04:26.557 --> 04:27.642
Don't let it out.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.853
Don't let it out!

04:46.703 --> 04:47.870
Dr. Turner?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.624
Hello?

04:53.751 --> 04:55.169
Dr. Turner's not here.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.256
Did his office hours change?
I've tried calling and--

04:58.339 --> 05:00.883
He's not holding office hours.
He's on leave.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.760
What do you mean he's on leave?

05:22.780 --> 05:23.781
Melody.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.534
-What are you doing here?
-I need your help.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.785
Please.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.204
It's important.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.877
Here you are.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.763
I think I'm being haunted.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.765
And why do you say that?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.856
The day I moved into the Visser,

05:56.939 --> 06:01.569
I, um, started having these dreams,
these conversations,

06:02.195 --> 06:03.738
with a man I didn't know.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.575
And when I'd wake up,
I couldn't remember his face

06:07.658 --> 06:09.243
or what we talked about.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.580
-A few days ago, I went to this séance.
-A séance?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.457
Beatriz, the medium,

06:14.540 --> 06:18.836
she started repeating his conversations
back to me, word for word,

06:18.920 --> 06:22.340
and suddenly I could remember everything.

06:22.423 --> 06:25.134
What he looks like, what he sounded like,

06:25.218 --> 06:26.761
what we talked about.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.388
Every fucking detail.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.641
He said he was your son

06:32.225 --> 06:33.559
and that his name was Dan.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.311
Your son's name is Dan, right?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.271
Danny, yes. But he's eight.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.564
He said I died

06:39.232 --> 06:40.441
in a fire.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.278
And that I was in danger,
and that I should get out of the Visser.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.783
And now every time I close my eyes,
I can see him.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.910
Hey, what are you
really doing here, Melody?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.496
I'm trying to ask you for help.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.332
The department put me on leave.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.377
Someone filed
an anonymous complaint against me.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.506
It wasn't you?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.716
No, why would it be?

07:06.717 --> 07:09.262
Well, the complaint states
I violated university policy

07:09.345 --> 07:12.432
by posting about a student
on an internet message board.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.519
Did you post about me on a message board?

07:16.602 --> 07:20.440
No. I mean, yes,
but I didn't identify you by name.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.695
All right, six months ago,

07:26.404 --> 07:29.365
a researcher put out a call
looking for subjects.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.077
He was studying a group of people
who had certain sensitivities.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.704
He called them "Baldung."

07:34.787 --> 07:38.458
Now, the markers he described
were identical to yours.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.252
The accounts of being pulled somewhere,

07:41.335 --> 07:44.464
of feeling that same
kind of paralyzing terror.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.842
And they all made drawings
exactly like yours.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.052
<i>Same patterns, same lines.</i>

07:50.136 --> 07:52.889
He said they had all shown
a genetic predisposition

07:52.972 --> 07:54.557
to unusual psychic perception.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.100
Did you talk to him?

07:56.184 --> 07:58.895
I met with him,
and we went over your case.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.191
He said you weren't a match.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.570
Look, I'm sorry. I, uh…

08:08.529 --> 08:11.407
I thought you came over here
with some kind of crazy ghost story

08:11.491 --> 08:13.159
to get back at me.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.286
So you're saying this could be real.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.500
Melody,

08:21.167 --> 08:25.421
I try to always leave room for
the unexplained corners of the universe.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.341
But most likely, this is just anxiety

08:28.424 --> 08:31.886
or your subconscious urging you
to abandon the search for your mother.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.804
No, I'm not imagining things.

08:33.888 --> 08:34.764
Okay.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.227
I have it all on tape.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.646
The séance, the cult meetings,

08:41.729 --> 08:44.357
everything that has been
happening in that building.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.442
I can show it to you.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.153
Excuse me.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.451
Look, I'm sorry, my family is here.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.831
Here is a referral.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.337
Hey, honey, this is, uh, Melody,
one of my students.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.089
She came to drop off some research.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.340
Nice to meet you.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.977
Do you need
a ride back to the station?

09:23.604 --> 09:25.273
I'll send you those tapes.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.550
Hey.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.177
Hey.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.020
What's in the jar?

10:05.187 --> 10:06.856
Have you been with Beatriz?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.066
Is she gonna be okay?

10:09.150 --> 10:11.235
Did she get the flowers Samuel sent?

10:11.319 --> 10:13.237
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.616
Seriously, what's in there?
Where's it from?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.201
Sorry.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.703
Client confidentiality.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.915
Is it for Samuel?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.308
Anabelle?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.902
<i>Anabelle and Melody</i>
<i>are currently taking part</i>

10:52.985 --> 10:55.696
<i>in a secret government</i>
<i>biosphere experiment.</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:59.116
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>and they'll be contacted by robot.</i>

11:00.117 --> 11:01.077
Anabelle?

11:01.869 --> 11:02.953
Are you there?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.290
Pick up. I really need to talk to you.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.879
Okay, just…

11:13.172 --> 11:14.256
call me back.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.967
I'm gonna page you.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.019
Hi, Ms. Lewis. Um, is Jess here?

11:27.103 --> 11:27.937
Yes.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.315
Would it be all right
if I asked her a quick question?

11:31.399 --> 11:34.151
Anabelle is gone, and I was hoping
she might have seen her.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.695
She's doing her homework.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.114
I'll let her know you came by.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.720
<i>Julia Bennett.</i>

12:01.512 --> 12:03.222
<i>We call you now.</i>

12:05.725 --> 12:07.435
<i>Melody is waiting.</i>

12:11.939 --> 12:13.190
<i>Julia Bennett?</i>

12:13.733 --> 12:15.276
<i>We call you now.</i>

12:16.235 --> 12:17.987
<i>Melody is waiting.</i>

12:19.530 --> 12:20.573
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

12:21.657 --> 12:24.952
<i>I'm afraid I don't sense her</i>
<i>in the realm of the dead.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:30.875
<i>Wait.</i>

12:32.793 --> 12:34.962
<i>There's someone else.</i>

12:48.142 --> 12:49.894
<i>"I can get out of your way."</i>

12:50.811 --> 12:51.812
<i>"Me too."</i>

13:18.339 --> 13:19.298
What the fuck?

13:20.299 --> 13:21.967
<i>"You died in a fire."</i>

13:22.051 --> 13:24.303
<i>"At the Visser, 25 years ago."</i>

13:24.386 --> 13:25.471
<i>"I'm sorry."</i>

13:26.013 --> 13:27.765
<i>"Are you crazy?"</i>

13:27.848 --> 13:29.225
<i>"It's your footage."</i>

13:30.017 --> 13:32.645
<i>"I'm trying to understand</i>
<i>what happened to you."</i>

13:32.728 --> 13:33.562
<i>Stop it.</i>

13:58.754 --> 14:00.256
I know where Anabelle is.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.011
Oh, darling, come in.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.430
Have you been to see Beatriz?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.516
Poor thing.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.854
Obviously, if I had
had any idea she was so unstable,

14:14.937 --> 14:16.897
I wouldn't have
asked her to do that reading.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.190
I'm here to see Anabelle.

14:18.774 --> 14:19.650
Anabelle?

14:19.733 --> 14:22.695
Jess told me she saw her
moving her stuff into your apartment.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.864
And that you told her not to tell me.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.116
Would you like a cup of tea?

14:27.992 --> 14:28.909
Anabelle?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.370
You smother her, you know.

14:32.788 --> 14:33.789
Excuse me?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.250
You need to let her emerge from the cocoon

14:36.333 --> 14:37.710
in which you keep her bound.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.005
Give her the freedom
to find herself, to fly.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.800
I can't stand by
and allow you to stifle Anabelle.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.387
As my darling Eleanor
was stifled by her family.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.723
Where is she, Cassandra?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.767
She needed space to create,

14:53.851 --> 14:57.646
so I gave her an apartment I own
on the sixth floor.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.939
Which apartment?

15:01.942 --> 15:04.778
Which apartment?

15:09.325 --> 15:12.620
-This floor needs a key?
-Oh, you know these old buildings.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.538
6C.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.287
Anabelle?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.208
Anabelle!

15:59.291 --> 16:00.709
No, no, no, Mel! No, no, don't look.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.211
Okay, stay back.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.546
Don't look. They're not ready yet.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.382
Okay, I'm not looking.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.094
What are you doing up here?

16:10.177 --> 16:11.470
Isn't it amazing?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.682
This building, Mel.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.768
This building is special.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.187
It speaks to me. I…

16:21.146 --> 16:24.817
I feel connected to something here.
Don't you?

16:25.401 --> 16:27.194
I think we should leave.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.321
Maybe your mom was an artist.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.159
Maybe she came to this building
to create, to dream,

16:34.243 --> 16:38.122
to forge a passage to another world,
just like Eleanor did.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.334
Anabelle, we need to go home.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.211
What?

16:44.294 --> 16:45.462
Back to Brooklyn.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.756
Back to our apartment.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.134
I thought you wanted to find Julia.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.343
I do. I…

16:52.052 --> 16:54.054
I just don't think it's safe here.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.643
You go.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.437
I'm gonna stay. I…

17:02.146 --> 17:03.981
need to get ready for my show.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.066
What show?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.528
The East Village Art Collective, Mel.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.322
Someone dropped out last minute
and Cassandra got me a spot.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.283
You have to come. Okay?

17:14.366 --> 17:16.076
Free wine, hot girls, hot guys,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.287
maybe ham sandwiches,
but I have to check on that.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.039
-When? Tonight?
-Yeah, tonight.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.248
Have you eaten today?

17:21.331 --> 17:24.585
I said there would be sandwiches
and free wine, okay? I'm saving myself.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.628
Goodbye. I love you.
Just get the fuck out.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.921
Anabelle!

17:28.797 --> 17:30.799
Anabelle, open the door. Anabelle!

18:58.220 --> 19:00.222
So this is the sixth floor.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.751
Fuck.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.962
What the fuck are you doing here, Melody?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.022
-Is it time? Did he send you?
-What?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.524
Father Russo.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.735
-I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have--
-Wait. Don't go. I need your help.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.154
Hey, get the fuck away from her.

21:21.738 --> 21:22.739
Go!

21:26.451 --> 21:28.370
I told you to stay away from this floor.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.538
Let's go.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.169
-Who are those people?
-None of your business.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.504
Ever turn that thing off?

21:37.587 --> 21:39.339
-Why are they humming that song?
-Song?

21:39.423 --> 21:42.509
That horrible fucking song
that I keep hearing in this building.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.095
-Are they part of the cult too?
-Cult?

21:45.178 --> 21:47.306
What the fuck are you talking about?

21:48.557 --> 21:50.058
Why are they locked in?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.935
It's for their own protection.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.895
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

21:53.979 --> 21:57.357
It means they're addicts,
and drugs are the only thing that matter.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.192
He's trying to protect them.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.152
Who is?

22:00.235 --> 22:01.278
Samuel.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.697
His sister was an addict.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.283
She froze to death in the park
when she was just a kid.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.494
He said he didn't want anyone else
picking out coffins for their sisters,

22:09.578 --> 22:12.956
so he rents out this floor for them,
keeps them warm.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.042
-Keeps them safe.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.085
He's trying to do something good.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.578
Dan?

23:03.924 --> 23:05.175
-Melody?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.885
Please, I need to talk to you.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.305
-Get out. Get the fuck down.
-Please.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.683
Your friend said that I could trust you.
Anabelle.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.853
-She said that you could help.
-Goddamn it, Anabelle.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.147
She said you're looking
for your mother, Julia.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.982
We can help each other.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.526
Please, just…

23:22.609 --> 23:23.985
just let me in.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.327
Just… say my name?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.453
That's right.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.456
Chris Lee.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.086
How long have you been here?

23:41.169 --> 23:44.089
Two years, maybe… 20. I…

23:44.172 --> 23:45.424
He doesn't…

23:47.259 --> 23:49.511
He doesn't want us to leave.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.140
He says he needs us to…

23:53.890 --> 23:54.766
open a door.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.227
Who needs you to open a door?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.563
Don't worry,
I didn't give your friend a taste.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.648
I wouldn't… I wouldn't do that.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.900
A taste of what?

24:05.152 --> 24:06.194
Stardust.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.531
That's what brought us here.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.450
That's what keeps us here.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.202
What's Stardust? Heroin?

24:15.245 --> 24:16.288
The mold.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.708
It grows here.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.501
It shimmers.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.919
Haven't you seen it?

24:24.337 --> 24:27.757
Running through this building
like deep, dark veins.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.719
The walls,

24:30.802 --> 24:32.262
the floors, the…

24:33.930 --> 24:35.056
the lungs.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.892
One hit?

24:38.018 --> 24:40.395
It's like another world opens up.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.439
And there's no going back.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.319
Did you know Julia?

24:48.695 --> 24:49.988
Did she live here?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.618
Was she an addict too?

24:54.701 --> 24:57.496
Uh, names are sort of…

24:59.080 --> 25:00.248
whoosh.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.710
Like something from the world out there,
not the world in here.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.632
What does she look like?

25:12.844 --> 25:13.845
I don't know.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.225
Like me, I guess.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.604
There was this woman.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.566
She had your hair.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.194
Same smile.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.320
Same…

25:31.238 --> 25:32.155
eyes.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.620
But she's gone.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.000
Where?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.131
Where did she go?

25:56.304 --> 25:58.139
Do… <i>you</i> hear it?

26:00.141 --> 26:01.101
Hear what?

26:01.726 --> 26:04.479
There's something in this place

26:05.313 --> 26:06.606
that calls to you.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.400
It…

26:11.987 --> 26:12.946
It calls.

26:17.867 --> 26:18.868
It calls.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.497
And we call back.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.564
-Stop.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.065
Stop it.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.610
Stop it, please!

26:56.072 --> 26:57.657
Can you help me find her?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.367
Julia.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.039
He said he'd give me a bed.

27:04.664 --> 27:05.624
Who?

27:07.042 --> 27:08.418
Father Russo. He…

27:09.377 --> 27:10.754
He came by a couple weeks back

27:10.837 --> 27:13.548
and said he'd send someone back
with a golden ticket.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.634
You know what that is?

27:17.010 --> 27:20.096
They give you a bed, free of charge,
no questions asked.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.222
Rehab.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.641
I wanna get clean, but…

27:26.269 --> 27:28.897
It… It pulls you.

27:30.732 --> 27:31.691
You know?

27:36.363 --> 27:37.906
If I don't get out of here

27:39.074 --> 27:40.200
real soon,

27:40.867 --> 27:42.952
the ferryman's gonna come
and drag me to hell.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.538
He's gonna drag us all to hell.

27:47.123 --> 27:50.502
Get me a bed,
and I'll help you find Julia.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.508
Okay.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.052
Let's go. Let's go right now.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.512
No! Fuck!

28:00.595 --> 28:03.223
No! He'll see me. He'll come for me.

28:03.932 --> 28:04.766
Who?

28:05.266 --> 28:07.185
I'm not supposed to leave.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.355
I need a ticket.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.066
Get me a ticket right fucking now!

28:13.149 --> 28:14.234
Or no deal.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.259
What happened?

28:41.386 --> 28:42.762
Father Russo.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.431
He's gone.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.391
What do you mean, "gone"?

28:46.474 --> 28:47.934
Last night…

28:48.017 --> 28:50.854
Late last night,
he fell in front of the train.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.188
What?

28:52.272 --> 28:55.734
I don't know why he was meeting someone
so late. He never went out that late.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.569
But he was like that.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.488
If someone was in trouble,
he'd drop everything to help.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.032
Excuse me.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.134
Fuck.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.135
I wouldn't take it if I didn't need it.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.043
What the hell?

30:40.964 --> 30:41.881


30:44.509 --> 30:47.387


31:34.851 --> 31:36.519
Holy shit.

31:42.442 --> 31:47.488
"Pedestal sculpture, Greenstone,
14th Century, provenance unknown."

31:48.114 --> 31:50.158
"Entity known as Kaelego."

31:51.409 --> 31:52.243
Kaelego.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.455
"Is cited as both god and demon."

32:14.974 --> 32:17.685
Oh my God. "Samuel Grant."

32:21.397 --> 32:22.857
"Virgil Samuelson."

32:24.192 --> 32:26.069
Who the fuck are you, Samuel?

32:30.657 --> 32:32.325
"Alistair Spare."

32:39.290 --> 32:40.708
"Baldung Coven."

33:12.365 --> 33:13.574
What the fuck?

33:31.509 --> 33:33.136
Can't get the door.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.013
Here, let me try.

33:39.892 --> 33:42.353
I am… I'm so sorry to do this.

33:42.437 --> 33:45.064
It's just, he borrowed the book
several weeks ago,

33:45.148 --> 33:47.608
and I need to return it to the university.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.069
I can't afford to replace it
on an adjunct salary.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.112
It's no problem.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.240
He was such a wonderful man.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.366
Mm.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.161
And I know how much he admired you.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.498
I think…
I think I'll just step out for a moment.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.916
Of course.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.372
-We're about to start the vigil.
-Oh.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.541
I found it.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.042
Thank you again.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.634
<i>Hello, this is Emily.</i>
<i>-And this is Dan.</i>

36:18.718 --> 36:20.803
<i> You've reached</i>
<i>the Turner residence.</i>

36:20.887 --> 36:24.682
<i>We're not in right now, but leave</i>
<i>a message and we'll call you right back.</i>

36:25.391 --> 36:26.517
Dr. Turner.

36:27.810 --> 36:31.189
Look, I'm sorry I just showed up
at your house today, but…

36:33.232 --> 36:35.818
The Baldung, they're witches.

36:36.485 --> 36:38.237
It's a fucking coven.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.240
And my mom's ring, it…

36:43.034 --> 36:44.869
it has all the same markings.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.082
Was she part of the cult?

36:55.755 --> 36:56.839
I'm sorry, I…

36:57.715 --> 36:58.925
I'll try you later.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.510
Melody.

37:03.346 --> 37:04.222
Dan?

37:07.642 --> 37:08.559
Dan!

37:34.502 --> 37:36.796
-Hello?
-<i>Mel, where the fuck are you?</i>

37:36.879 --> 37:39.757
<i>You said you'd come.</i>
<i>Get your ass over here.</i>

37:40.841 --> 37:41.926
I'm sorry. Uh…

37:42.718 --> 37:44.553
I forgot. I'm-- I'm on my way.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.211
Melody! You fucking slut.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.006
I can't believe you forgot.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.466
I'm sorry, but I need
to tell you something.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.759
Oh, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.553
Mel, this is Gabby.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.472
She's the genius curator
who put on this show.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.517
Gabs, this is my best girl, Melody.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.478
Your friend is on fucking fire.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.692
You can't come back
to the Visser tonight, okay?

38:39.775 --> 38:40.860
You need to go home.

38:40.943 --> 38:44.780
Well, home is where the heart is,
and you are my heart.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.032
-I'm serious.
-So--

38:46.115 --> 38:49.201
We're leaving the Visser.
Both of us. Tonight.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.997
You ready to see my stuff now? Come.

38:57.752 --> 38:58.669
See?

39:02.631 --> 39:03.716
Who is this?

39:04.675 --> 39:05.885
I don't know.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.889
What do you mean?

39:10.973 --> 39:12.141
I don't know. I…

39:13.392 --> 39:14.602
But she's in there.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.064
What? In where?

39:18.773 --> 39:19.940
I see her.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.821
Okay, what is all this?

39:27.239 --> 39:28.657
You know what it is.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.410
It's the other place.

39:32.119 --> 39:35.247
The paint. The paint lets you see it.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.126
I am a Spirit Receiver now, Mel.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.796
-Just like Eleanor.
-What?

39:41.879 --> 39:44.882
Can I borrow her?
I promise to bring her back.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.550
She's got fans to meet.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.430
Mold.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.600
It's the mold.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.187
Who the fuck is that?

40:45.025 --> 40:46.026
I don't know.

40:46.694 --> 40:47.820
You tell me.

40:50.364 --> 40:52.741
Cassandra had a painting of her

40:52.825 --> 40:54.660
hanging in the apartment.

40:55.244 --> 40:59.039
One of Eleanor's
crazy fucking spirit visions.

41:00.833 --> 41:05.212
Maybe she gave Anabelle a peek.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.722
I'm gonna get
another plastic cup of garbage wine.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.225
You want some?

41:26.484 --> 41:27.610
Melody.

41:29.111 --> 41:30.571
What are you doing here?

41:31.113 --> 41:33.741
Samuel says I need to see more art
if I'm gonna make art,

41:33.824 --> 41:36.285
so Cassandra brought me along.

41:36.368 --> 41:37.953
Does your mom know you're here?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.790
I'm gonna go shoot some stuff.

41:44.877 --> 41:45.961
She's not a child.

41:46.045 --> 41:49.131
She's a bright young artist
who needs stimulation.

41:49.215 --> 41:51.675
Okay, a crowd like this
could set her seizures off.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.511
She's not an invalid, Melody.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.347
Why can't you stop smothering?

42:10.903 --> 42:13.781
My paintings
aren't for sale, okay? Fuck off!

42:13.864 --> 42:16.659
If you didn't want to sell,
why the fuck are you even here?

42:16.742 --> 42:20.955
To share them! With the world!
To show them where she is!

42:21.038 --> 42:23.666
Listen. They paid in cash. Okay?

42:23.749 --> 42:25.209
I don't care. Give it back.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.503
I can't. The buyer wants
to remain anonymous.

42:27.586 --> 42:28.921
Oh, bullshit.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.131
-Thief. Fucking liar.
-Anabelle, it's okay.

42:31.715 --> 42:32.550
Anabelle!

42:32.633 --> 42:34.969
Planning on reimbursing me
my fucking commission?

42:35.052 --> 42:37.221
-Anabelle, calm down.
-These are mine.

42:37.304 --> 42:39.765
Leave them. You can paint more.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

42:39.848 --> 42:40.766
They're mine, okay?

42:40.849 --> 42:43.102
If you're not gonna
help me fucking save them,

42:43.185 --> 42:44.937
-then just stay the fuck away!

42:48.566 --> 42:50.067
Cassandra's right.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.278
You're always fucking smothering me!

43:17.678 --> 43:18.929
Hold on one second.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.932
Did you buy those paintings?

43:22.683 --> 43:23.517
I'm sorry?

43:23.601 --> 43:26.312
Don't fuck with me, Samuel.
Did you buy the paintings?

43:26.395 --> 43:27.646
I'm sorry, I don't--

43:27.730 --> 43:28.981
Anabelle's paintings.

43:29.064 --> 43:31.233
At the gallery? At the fucking gallery?

43:31.317 --> 43:32.568
I just saw you there.

43:32.651 --> 43:36.447
Cassandra asked me to stop by as a favor.
I didn't buy any paintings.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.157
What is going on with you and Cassandra?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.825
What the fuck game are you playing?

43:39.908 --> 43:41.744
-Game?
-I know about the sixth floor.

43:41.827 --> 43:45.873
About the junkies you got locked up,
all strung out on your fucking Stardust.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.833
Singing that song over and over.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.960
I have no idea what you're talking about.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.880
What the fuck is going on
in this building? Who are you?

43:52.963 --> 43:55.382
-Who am I?
-Alistair Spare?

43:55.466 --> 43:56.592
Samuel Grant?

43:57.176 --> 43:58.719
Virgil Samuelson?

43:58.802 --> 44:00.846
Father Russo found you out, didn't he?

44:00.929 --> 44:02.723
All of your fake fucking names?

44:02.806 --> 44:05.351
And that's why you
shoved him onto the tracks?

44:05.434 --> 44:08.270
-He met you last night, didn't he?
-Turn it off. Turn off the camera.

44:08.354 --> 44:12.066
What about my mother?
Was she part of your weird fucking cult?

44:12.149 --> 44:13.317
Did you murder her too?

44:13.400 --> 44:14.443
Stop, Melody, please.

44:14.526 --> 44:17.196
You're clearly drunk
or high or out of your mind.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.490
Answer the fucking question!

44:25.120 --> 44:27.081
Somebody call an ambulance!

44:30.709 --> 44:31.835
Holy shit.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.504
Oh my God.

44:50.729 --> 44:52.022
What the fuck?

45:07.871 --> 45:11.125
What the fuck is going on here?

45:20.342 --> 45:22.052
<i>I know you're watching this.</i>

45:22.678 --> 45:23.887
<i>Watching me.</i>

45:23.971 --> 45:25.431
<i>You fucking liar.</i>

45:26.056 --> 45:27.808
<i>You were there. You were there!</i>

45:29.268 --> 45:31.603
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

46:13.437 --> 46:15.355
Samuel was my brother.

46:17.941 --> 46:18.942
He had…

46:20.194 --> 46:21.737
so much potential.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.448
But he…

46:25.824 --> 46:27.785
channeled it into all the wrong places.

46:27.868 --> 46:31.455
Okay, what the fuck am I really doing here
and why am I restoring these tapes?

46:33.373 --> 46:35.751
I believe Melody Pendras
murdered my brother.

46:36.293 --> 46:38.378
I believe the evidence is in that footage.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.550
What are you fucking talking about?

46:43.634 --> 46:44.510
Samuel was…

46:46.053 --> 46:47.095
charming,

46:48.305 --> 46:49.264
eccentric,

46:49.348 --> 46:52.142
prone to delusions of grandeur.

46:52.226 --> 46:55.979
And yes, he did go down
quite a rabbit hole with that…

46:57.481 --> 46:59.024
occult nonsense.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.025
But he was harmless.

47:00.108 --> 47:04.154
He was leading some kind of
fucked-up cult in that building!

47:04.738 --> 47:05.864
Wasn't real, Dan.

47:06.865 --> 47:09.618
It was just a bunch of
garage-sale knickknacks

47:09.701 --> 47:13.038
and some gullible people
and Samuel's overactive imagination.

47:13.121 --> 47:14.248
Bullshit.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.959
Melody Pendras was
a traumatized young woman

47:17.042 --> 47:18.460
who got it into her head

47:19.086 --> 47:22.130
that her mother had lived in the Visser.

47:22.214 --> 47:25.050
When she couldn't find Julia Bennett,
she lost her grip.

47:25.133 --> 47:28.136
She took all of her loneliness and rage

47:28.220 --> 47:30.472
and pointed it right back at my brother.

47:30.556 --> 47:31.557
That didn't happen.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.268
That's exactly what happened.

47:37.145 --> 47:39.481
She bought into his ridiculous fiction,

47:39.565 --> 47:43.861
decided Samuel
was the cause of all her troubles.

47:43.944 --> 47:47.781
So, she set fire to that building
and killed my brother

47:47.865 --> 47:50.659
-and all those other people with him.
-No.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.703
You seen anything
to contradict what I'm saying?

47:52.786 --> 47:53.745
She wouldn't do that.

47:53.829 --> 47:56.081
You sit here alone, hour after hour,

47:56.164 --> 48:00.210
watching a young woman share
her intimate thoughts and experiences,

48:00.294 --> 48:01.962
her dreams, her pain.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.506
-You think you know her.
-I<i> do</i> know her.

48:04.590 --> 48:07.009
Melody clearly
had grievances with my brother.

48:07.092 --> 48:09.636
She wanted to hurt him.
She wanted to make him pay.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.139
And if she could do
something like that to him,

48:12.222 --> 48:14.766
who's to say
she didn't do that to your family?

48:14.850 --> 48:16.101
To your father?

48:16.184 --> 48:18.478
Who's to say she didn't burn them all?

48:21.815 --> 48:25.944
Haven't you always wondered if
it wasn't your father who set that fire?

48:27.654 --> 48:29.698
What if he's innocent, Dan?

48:29.781 --> 48:31.658
What if it was Melody Pendras?

48:32.868 --> 48:34.703
What if she murdered your family?

48:38.123 --> 48:39.875
That's fucking impossible.

48:41.793 --> 48:42.794
Is it?

48:53.805 --> 48:55.349
Finish those tapes, Dan.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.352
Find out what really happened.

49:01.104 --> 49:03.231
Maybe we'll both get some closure.
