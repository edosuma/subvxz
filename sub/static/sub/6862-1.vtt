WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.037
George Tucker and Lemon
 Breeland are getting married.

00:03.071 --> 00:06.774
That is how this story ends.
I thought you knew
I decided to stay.

00:06.807 --> 00:07.808
He still has feelings for me.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.043
He chose Lemon.

00:09.077 --> 00:09.810
Now, you show up
at that wedding,

00:09.843 --> 00:11.179
he's gonna chose her again.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.714
GEORGE:
 Lemon, I cannot marry you,

00:13.747 --> 00:16.117
not when a part of me
is in love with someone else.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.118
Doc, I'm not saying
I want to marry you.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.388
All I'm saying is
 there's something here.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.322
Zoe, I thought that
if you went to New York,

00:21.355 --> 00:22.490
I might be able to put you
out of my mind

00:22.523 --> 00:25.693
and maybe I could have,
 but now I know that I can't.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.061
And I don't want to.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.851
TOM:
It's devastating.

00:50.884 --> 00:55.756
Before today, I never really
knew what "torn asunder" meant.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.626
I think we know
who's to blame.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.830
You're right, the Lord's
hand is in all things.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.799
I'm seeing someone
else's hand in this one.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.608
(phone ringing)

01:28.922 --> 01:31.091
(door opens, closes)

01:35.663 --> 01:37.198
ANNABETH;
Move back.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.199
You don't want to
be the first thing

01:38.232 --> 01:39.267
she sees when
she wakes up.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.901
She may swallow you whole
before you can blink.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.869
It is heartbreaking.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.003
Shh!
Shh!

01:43.036 --> 01:46.374
Lemon was supposed to move
into George's place today.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.876
And I was gonna move
into her room!

01:48.909 --> 01:50.878
Magnolia, this
is not about you.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.913
Lemon has been
planning her future

01:52.946 --> 01:55.616
with George Tucker for years.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.784
What is she gonna do now?!

01:56.817 --> 01:58.419
ANNABETH:
It is no worse

01:58.452 --> 01:59.553
than Jake leaving me.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.222
I survived and
Lemon will, too.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.490
Lemon is not like you.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.225
She cares what people think.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.793
I care what people think.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.395
Then, sweetheart,
reconsider that dress.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.799
How is she gonna walk
through this town again?

02:11.832 --> 02:13.534
The humiliation.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.637
Personally, I would up and die
if it happened to me.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.805
Up and die.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.873
(gasps)

02:20.841 --> 02:24.445
I can hear you.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.180
I said
move back.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.253
Lavon, Lavon,
Lavon, Lavon.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.854
Lavon!

02:33.887 --> 02:35.856
Mmm.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.925
Hi.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.529
Well, I can't say
I'm surprised to see you.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.530
I know.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.531
I heard.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.932
Oh, God. Oh, no.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.534
I can explain.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.701
What is there to explain?

02:47.735 --> 02:48.936
George cancelled his wedding,

02:48.969 --> 02:49.870
presumably, for you.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.940
Oh, George.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.408
Yeah, George. He did.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.277
So why don't you look happier?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.847
Okay, I'm just going to tell you

02:59.880 --> 03:01.215
because I have to tell someone.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.683
Don't judge.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.951
Okay.
Last night,

03:03.984 --> 03:05.419
while George was calling off
his wedding,

03:05.453 --> 03:06.954
I was kinda having sex
with Wade.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.689
Wade?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.324
Mm-hmm.
(laughing)

03:10.358 --> 03:11.425
Hey!

03:11.459 --> 03:14.462
And how'd that work out for you?

03:14.495 --> 03:17.698
Let's just say I finally
understand what R. Kelly's

03:17.731 --> 03:19.433
been singing about
all these years.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.502
But it was more
than amazing sex.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.571
Wade and I...

03:23.604 --> 03:24.772
connected.

03:25.873 --> 03:26.907
Maybe there's more to him
than I thought.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.876
You know, if George
hadn't showed up last night,

03:28.909 --> 03:30.244
Wade and I might...

03:30.278 --> 03:31.779
Wow.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.980
But George did show up.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.982
Exactly.
And George is George.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.183
You know how I feel about him.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.986
Zoe Hart, you went from no
boyfriends to two in one night.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.988
Turns out that I have way
more game than I thought.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.656
Question is,
which one are you gonna keep?

03:42.690 --> 03:43.891
Exactly.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.459
Which one, Lavon?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.928
That question was for you.

03:47.961 --> 03:48.862
Yeah, but I don't know.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.930
And you're my best friend.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.665
So, you need to advise me.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.634
Look inside your soul.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.802
Picture me with both guys.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.003
Who I look happier with?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.405
You really need
to get a girlfriend.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.806
I know, but you're all I have.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.808
Oh... (sigh)

04:00.841 --> 04:04.745
Look, all I know is that
Wade just slept with the girl

04:04.778 --> 04:06.013
that he's been pining for
for months,

04:06.046 --> 04:10.284
George just called off
his wedding for the girl

04:10.318 --> 04:11.485
he's been pining for
for months.

04:11.519 --> 04:14.021
One of them is going
to get hurt.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.690
But if it was me, I would be
honest with both of them

04:16.724 --> 04:17.825
before it blows up
in your face.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.027
That's your best idea?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.394
I really do need a girlfriend.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.901
Or you could cash in
your honeymoon tickets

04:27.935 --> 04:29.537
and take a cruise.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.071
Stay away till
the dust settles.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.440
I could come
with you.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.974
Two single ladies
on the high seas.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.576
Hello, sailor.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.678
I am not going
on a singles cruise, AnnaBeth.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.447
I've been single
for one day.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.915
Just that some of 'em
do Broadway shows.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.650
I could finally see Hairspray.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.918
Or you can move
to another town.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.053
Change your name.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.921
Something like
Lennon Breeland.

04:47.955 --> 04:48.956
Or Linden Breeland.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.058
I'm not leaving town
just because I got dumped.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.826
I'm going to show this town
that my happiness

04:52.860 --> 04:54.928
does not depend
on George Tucker marrying me.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.665
I am a survivor.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.866
Me, too.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.067
Maybe we could survive

05:00.100 --> 05:02.069
in one of those
nice beach hotels

05:02.102 --> 05:03.203
in Bon Secour
for a couple days.

05:03.236 --> 05:06.540
I'm gonna make my fresh start
right here in BlueBell.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.409
First thing,
I'm gonna get my own place.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.977
What? When?
BRICK: You're what?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.812
LEMON: Today. What?
I'm already packed.

05:11.845 --> 05:12.980
I'll move into your bedroom.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.014
Lemon, no.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.418
Living on your own
is like saying you've given up.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.119
It's one step away
from letting your hair go gray

05:19.152 --> 05:20.854
and caring about animals.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.956
Lemon, you need your family
around you right now.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.492
Let us take care of you.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.959
Daddy, you are
missing the point.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.962
I don't need anyone
to take care of me.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.733
I am Lemon Breeland,
strong Southern belle,

05:32.766 --> 05:34.968
and I will rise again.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.437
Without help.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.605
On my own.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.743
AnnaBeth.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.712
Yeah, oh, yeah.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.381
(door opens)

05:48.081 --> 05:50.784
(coughs)
George.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.652
What are you doing here?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.922
Well, I was coming
by to thank Lavon

05:54.955 --> 05:56.056
for all his help
last night,

05:56.089 --> 05:57.858
but it's good to see you this
fine morning, Miss Hart.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.860
Actually, now that
I think about it,

05:59.893 --> 06:03.731
maybe thanking Lavon
can wait just a second.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.667
I know I'm still
just processing it all.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.537
What is there to process?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.171
I called off my
wedding for you.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.741
That is what they call
a grand romantic gesture.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.142
It was just all so sudden.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.144
That's what makes it grand.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.879
But, George, you have to admit,
I mean, it's a little crazy.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.914
You just broke up
with Lemon yesterday.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.917
All I know is
that I chose you.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.953
And I want you.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.088
And I know you
feel the same way.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.957
(whistling)

06:31.959 --> 06:34.895
Well, fancy meeting
you two here.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.830
Tucker, I thought
you'd be on your,

06:36.864 --> 06:38.766
uh, honeymoon by now.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.833
See, if you wouldn't
have flaked last night,

06:39.867 --> 06:42.402
you would've known
that I called off the wedding.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.939
Right, sorry I missed that.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.841
I, uh, had my hands full.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.978
Mini muffin?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.580
Wade, mini muffin?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.847
George, mini muffin?

06:53.881 --> 06:55.048
Don't mind if I do.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.950
Yeah.

06:56.984 --> 06:57.951
And, uh, thanks again
for last night, Doc.

06:57.985 --> 07:02.790
That, uh, house call
totally cured my affliction.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.957
Good muffin.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.561
(door opens)

07:08.762 --> 07:11.198
No.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.601
No, you got to
be kidding me.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.135
I thought you
were getting married.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.538
I know, but Wade?

07:17.571 --> 07:19.072
You and Wade?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.875
Wade and you?

07:21.909 --> 07:23.076
Stop saying that.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.979
Wade and Zoe.
Zoe and Wade.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.816
It just happened.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.551
You got feelings for him?

07:30.584 --> 07:34.221
Okay, honest.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.624
Um, I'm not sure.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.959
Wow.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.828
I-I see.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.895
Okay.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.897
No, but, George, you know
how I feel about you.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.967
None of this is
what I expected to happen.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.704
I just, I need some time
t-to think.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.839
Yeah, how long do you
think that's gonna take?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.240
(laughs)
Just ballpark it for me.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.374
A week or a month or...

07:54.407 --> 07:57.044
You know, I just turned my
life upside down for you,

07:57.077 --> 07:59.146
so if you're gonna run
off with someone else,

07:59.179 --> 08:00.147
then I'd like to know
as soon as possible.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.248
I know...

08:01.281 --> 08:02.916
Okay. All right.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.151
Wh...

08:04.184 --> 08:06.086
Lavon.

08:11.024 --> 08:11.992
Did I, uh, miss anything?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.994
Just be honest with them?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.896
You are the worst girlfriend
in the whole world.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.801
(car horn honks)

08:20.834 --> 08:22.936
(seagulls calling)

08:22.970 --> 08:24.905
(birds singing)

08:40.187 --> 08:42.956
Well, well, well.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.225
Alabama certainly
has changed you.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.695
Yes, Lord.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.029
You are a walking
country song, Dr. Hart.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.965
I should have
told you about George

08:51.999 --> 08:53.901
calling off the
wedding earlier.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.102
That was him
at the door last night.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.237
Yeah.

08:57.270 --> 09:01.642
Is that's why you were so tired
when you came back to bed?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.110
Well, why aren't
you smiling?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.845
Figure you'd be happier
than a dead pig

09:04.878 --> 09:06.980
in the sunshine now that
Mr. Wonderful is single.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.048
Wade, stop.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.917
You're putting
up walls.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.318
I get how you work by now.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.053
But you don't have to.

09:13.086 --> 09:17.124
Last night,
you and I connected.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.927
I'm not just going
to forget that.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.561
I told George that
I needed time to think.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.264
Think about what?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.835
Oh.
(laughs)

09:27.868 --> 09:31.705
Ah, uh.

09:31.739 --> 09:35.108
Yup. You know, this
happens sometimes.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.678
A woman will mistake
finally having good sex

09:37.711 --> 09:40.013
for a connection.

09:40.047 --> 09:44.017
Last night, something
happened between us.

09:44.051 --> 09:48.088
Yeah, well, you had A-plus
sex for your first time.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.090
What do you mean
I had A-plus sex?

09:50.123 --> 09:51.258
You had it, too.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.626
Right?

09:52.660 --> 09:57.264
Yeah, for me it was more... B?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.967
B-minus.
What?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.835
Sorry.

10:01.869 --> 10:02.836
B-minus?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.271
Good luck with Goldenboy.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.274
(frustrated grunt)

10:07.307 --> 10:09.242
BABS:
 Well, it's a mite small,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.912
but the location
can't be beat.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.748
So, what do you think?

10:14.782 --> 10:16.650
I'll take it.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.252
Lemon, this place
isn't for you?

10:19.286 --> 10:23.256
Oh, honey, don't you think you'd
be better off resting at home,

10:23.290 --> 10:25.993
where you can
be looked after?

10:26.026 --> 10:28.662
Babs, just give her
the application please.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.265
Well, I suppose
the choice is yours.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.401
Just have your father
co-sign and we're all set.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.270
Oh, I don't need my father
to co-sign.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.872
See, I'm an adult.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.909
I know that, honey, but you
don't have any income.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.311
Or any prospects
of getting any.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.013
Or even a credit score.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.314
Babs Foster,

10:47.347 --> 10:50.217
you have known me since
I was in my mother's womb.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.885
You know that I am good
for the rent.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.754
Yes, well, I know Brick is.

10:53.787 --> 10:57.290
You can bring the application
by my office later.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.926
Hmm?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.163
Okay, well, now what?

11:03.196 --> 11:06.033
I'm going to get myself a job.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.801
Oh... Oh.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.040
DELMA: And that's all
I have to say about that.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.207
Oh, come on, Delma.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.443
No, you come on,
Shula, face facts.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.946
George Tucker's had
his eye on Zoe Hart

11:18.979 --> 11:20.313
since the day she
came to this town.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.715
George Tucker
is an upstanding man.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.184
He's gonna represent
my cat in court.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.486
Lindsey Taub's...
Uh, l-ladies? Ladies!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.789
Can you gossip
while you clean?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.858
See-see, we got a bunch of
debris over by the church,

11:30.891 --> 11:34.061
and in times like these, we
need a clear path to the Lord.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.064
Amen.
Amen, amen.
All right.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.331
Listen, I've
had enough of you.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.499
(continues indistinctly)

11:39.532 --> 11:42.202
Ladies. (chuckles)

11:42.235 --> 11:45.939
Now you see, it's people
skills like that

11:45.973 --> 11:46.874
that make you such
a good mayor.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.010
What's going on, Dash?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.144
Mayor Hayes,
your reelection is coming up.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.514
And, uh, well, I would love
to be your campaign manager.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.349
Yeah, I'd-I'd be honored,

11:56.383 --> 11:59.887
but, uh, since Lavon Hayes
is running unopposed...

11:59.920 --> 12:01.488
Mayor Hayes, if you
think you can just get by

12:01.521 --> 12:05.959
on your 98.7% popularity
and football legacy,

12:05.993 --> 12:07.260
I'm here to tell you,

12:07.294 --> 12:09.963
this little scandal might
just bring you down.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.965
Scandal?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.834
One word: Zoegate.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.969
Many of the voters believe
that your little bestie

12:16.003 --> 12:18.505
is somehow behind the breakup.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.974
Oh. Oh, no, no.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.110
I'm sure BlueBellians are
smarter than that, Dash.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.244
Come on, now.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.780
We shall see.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.982
I will not be treated
by a home wrecker.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.918
With all that
wax in there,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.119
I'm surprised you
could hear the gossip.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.887
Don't look in my
ears, home wrecker!

12:33.921 --> 12:34.988
Grandpa!

12:35.022 --> 12:37.791
Will you let the doctor
do her job?

12:37.825 --> 12:39.526
Listen, it's-it's
not personal, okay?

12:39.559 --> 12:42.529
He called Ms. Ulvestadt down
at the bank a Norwegian spy.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.264
Oh, yeah.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.300
Oh, my gosh,
look at your adorable boots.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.302
I will not look at her boobs.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.005
I said "boots," Gramps.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.807
Oh.
When you remove the wax,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.142
can you remove his tongue, too?

12:55.175 --> 12:56.443
Yeah, no problem.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.578
All right, she can look
in my ears, but that's it.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.914
Only Dr. Breeland can deal
with my lower half.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.415
Lucky him.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.416
I'm Ruby.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.018
Hey, I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.220
Yes, I've heard a lot
about you today.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.957
None of it good,
which makes me like you already.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.425
That makes me
like you already.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.560
Why haven't
we met before?

13:13.593 --> 13:14.895
I live in Atlanta.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.497
Uh, moved away
the day I graduated.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.366
And for obvious reasons,
I've never wanted to come back.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.068
Well, how have you
angered the universe,

13:21.101 --> 13:23.070
that it would send
you back now?
Ow.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.972
I recently sold
my cosmetics line

13:25.005 --> 13:26.606
and until I figure out
my next step,

13:26.639 --> 13:29.342
I've been guilted into visiting
family for a few days.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.911
Ow.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.312
Which basically consists
of carting Gramps around

13:32.345 --> 13:34.848
and having people wonder
what kind of mischief

13:34.882 --> 13:36.049
I got into
in the big city.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.084
I have no idea
what that's like.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.585
Of course.
(laughs)

13:38.618 --> 13:39.953
Sergeant, you
are all set.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.354
Well, it's about time.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.522
Whoa.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.858
Yeah.
Hey, I can hear.

13:45.993 --> 13:46.994
Well, Doctor.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.329
Good luck with all
the home wrecking.
Thank you.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.464
Guess Gramps and I are gonna
get us some of that sludge

13:51.498 --> 13:54.067
that you call coffee
at Agnes' bakery.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.204
You know, if you want to stay, I
just got a new espresso maker.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.205
Well, yeah, fancy.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.873
No, no, no!

13:59.907 --> 14:02.242
If you want the home wrecker's
brew, that's your problem.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.979
Can you please make mine
a double, right now? Thanks.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.217
(knock on door)

14:10.250 --> 14:12.619
Oh.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.121
Emily.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.488
Hello.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.623
Oh, what a nice surprise.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.625
Oh, come in.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.960
I just wanted to tell
you how sorry I am

14:19.993 --> 14:21.394
about your
daughter's wedding.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.230
Oh...
Well, I know I'm
family of the groom

14:23.263 --> 14:25.532
but, uh, I hope there's
no hard feelings.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.000
Oh, no, of course not!

14:27.034 --> 14:29.236
No, it's-it's
wonderful to see you.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.139
H-How much longer you gonna
be staying around?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.974
Actually, I'm leaving
town tomorrow.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.109
Oh.
But...

14:36.143 --> 14:38.912
I was wondering if you might
like to grab some dinner later.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.514
If you don't mind
consorting with the enemy.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.116
Not that we'd
be consorting.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.153
Whatever consorting
actually even means.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.154
Well, dinner or consorting...

14:47.187 --> 14:48.055
MAGNOLIA:
Dad!

14:48.088 --> 14:50.257
Lemon already opened
this stupid cake knife

14:50.290 --> 14:52.125
and I don't even
know what to do.
Magnolia, uh, this is, uh...

14:52.159 --> 14:54.661
There are like 800 gifts left
to return before Lemon gets back

14:54.694 --> 14:56.396
and if they are still here,

14:56.429 --> 14:58.065
the steam might
make her head pop off.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.566
I know, I know.
I'll be right there, I promise.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.201
Okay.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.269
Emily, I'm so sorry.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.471
The timing is just terrible.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.339
Um, I'm going to have
to pass on dinner.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.674
Of course.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.009
Good luck to you, Brick.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.210
It was so nice to meet you.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.312
My pleasure.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.152
ZOE:
I know that my jerk neighbor

15:19.186 --> 15:20.620
does have feelings for me.

15:20.653 --> 15:24.057
But he shows it by calling
me a B-minus in bed.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.027
Ew.
I know, it's like
not exactly mature.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.461
Right? And this other guy?
Mmm.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.363
He left someone
at the altar for me.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.300
Mmm.
But I don't even know how
it would work between us.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.368
The town already blames
me for the breakup,

15:35.402 --> 15:37.070
and this guy,
he is this town,

15:37.104 --> 15:39.572
So, he would never
ever leave.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.174
It's kind of an
impossible situation.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.076
So what should I do?

15:43.110 --> 15:47.580
I think you need to look
deep inside your soul

15:47.614 --> 15:49.182
and imagine yourself
with both guys.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.618
Which one would
make you happier?

15:51.651 --> 15:52.419
Finally.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.221
You know, someone
who understands.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.222
Yeah.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.223
Who do you see?

15:56.256 --> 15:57.724
George Tucker.

15:57.757 --> 15:58.992
George, really?

15:59.026 --> 15:59.993
George Tucker.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.028
Hey.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.330
Sorry, didn't realize
you'd be with somebody.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.065
I'll just wait,
if that's all right.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.066
Hey, Ruby.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.267
Hey, G.T.
How you doing?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.737
You know what? I actually
better get going, too.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.673
I'm sure I'm way behind
on apologizing for Gramps.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.142
No, wait,
you can't go.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.643
I need you, okay?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.745
Could you maybe come over
for dinner tonight?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.547
I live over at the mayor's.
The mayor's?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.215
Mm-hmm.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.750
Well, I'd love to.

16:23.783 --> 16:24.984
Thank you.
Good.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.692
Hi.
Hey.

16:32.725 --> 16:36.429
Zoe, I just want to say that
I'm sorry about this morning.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.431
I was jealous.

16:38.465 --> 16:42.102
And if you choose Wade,
then so be it.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.771
It's my fault for waiting
to tell you how I really felt

16:44.804 --> 16:46.306
about you, but I want
you to know something.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.775
Lemon and I are over.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.778
For good. For... forever.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.247
You are?
Yes.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.715
Are you sure?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.150
Yes.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.253
So choose me.

17:00.287 --> 17:04.057
Look, I'm not saying
that it's gonna be easy,

17:04.090 --> 17:06.126
I'm not even saying that I
know what's gonna happens next,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.327
but I do know this:

17:07.359 --> 17:09.462
yesterday, when you told me
you were staying in BlueBell...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.833
...I suddenly felt the girl
of my dreams right there

17:13.866 --> 17:16.669
within my reach
and I had to reach.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.738
And I did.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.540
And I hurt Lemon
and I did things yesterday

17:21.574 --> 17:25.678
that I... I never imagined
that I would.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.182
But it was either
that or risk

17:29.216 --> 17:32.685
spending the rest
of my life

17:32.719 --> 17:35.822
wondering if I let
the woman that I know

17:35.855 --> 17:38.825
I am meant to be with
slip right through my fingers.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.560
(knock on door)

17:40.593 --> 17:42.695
Dr. Hart?
Brick.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.830
Hi.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.633
I should have known
that somehow

17:46.666 --> 17:49.102
you would be involved
in all this.

17:49.136 --> 17:49.902
Hold on, Brick, she
didn't have anything to...

17:49.936 --> 17:51.304
And I don't want
to hear another word

17:51.338 --> 17:52.472
out of you
right now, Tucker.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.776
You have a patient.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.713
Look, Zoe.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.251
We can deal with all this,
I promise you that.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.754
Choose me.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.877
Lemon Breeland? No.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.245
Is that you?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.281
Oh, dear God, no.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.249
Ruby Jeffries.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.584
I didn't know that
you were in town.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.853
How are you?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.256
I'm so fine, fantastic,
never been better.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.493
I heard about the breakup.
I am so, so sorry.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.627
Let me tell
you something.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.298
After my divorce, I realized
that my marriage had been

18:51.331 --> 18:53.766
distracting me
from all of my goals.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.637
And now, I can actually focus
on what I really want.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.706
Now, Lemon, I mean, there
had to have been something

18:59.739 --> 19:02.842
that you've wanted more in life
other than just being a wife.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.812
Well...

19:05.845 --> 19:07.247
Lemon, you do
have a plan B?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.248
Of course.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.684
But, see, I don't stop at B,
I have so many plans

19:11.718 --> 19:13.720
they just run through the whole
alphabet and start over--

19:13.753 --> 19:15.922
AA, BB, like the rows
in a movie theater.

19:15.955 --> 19:16.923
So, no plan B, huh?

19:16.956 --> 19:21.794
I am currently
looking for a job.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.929
It's all very
exciting actually.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.198
My plan B is to be
a career woman.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.666
(laughing)
What?

19:26.699 --> 19:27.667
I'm sorry.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.835
You did it.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.270
Bless your heart.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.405
I've been cursed
with blinding ambition

19:32.439 --> 19:33.340
since the day
I was born.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.608
Worked so hard I thought
it might kill me.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.944
Of course, now I could basically
retire to my own private island.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.213
And yet here you are
in BlueBell. Lucky us.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.080
But, you...

19:41.113 --> 19:44.351
Have you ever even
had a job, Lemon?

19:44.384 --> 19:47.887
I have been a Belle and the head
of every Junior League committee

19:47.920 --> 19:49.322
for the past ten years.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.623
I've had tons of jobs.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.824
It's not a job if they
don't pay you, dear.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.694
Well, I'm working hard at not
slapping you silly right now.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.728
Does that count?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.430
Oh, Lemon, don't
be so serious.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.965
I only teased you in high school
because you were three grades

19:58.998 --> 20:00.500
younger and you were
too big for your britches

20:00.533 --> 20:03.703
and you were
named after a fruit.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.305
Oh, but just look at you.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.641
After all these years,
you haven't changed a bit.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.876
Here.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.845
It's from my
cosmetics line.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.848
New makeup makes
everybody feel better.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.450
Go on.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.786
Ta-ta.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.023
WADE:
 Here are your fries.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.627
You know, you should probably
cut back on this stuff, Doc.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.895
You don't want
to be weighed down

20:28.928 --> 20:29.962
when the George scandal breaks

20:29.996 --> 20:31.998
and the town's chasing
after you with pitchforks.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.866
Wade, stop.
Stop what?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.802
All of it.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.971
The glibness, the sarcasm,
anything Wade-like, just stop.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.774
I put myself out there.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.476
I told you how I felt
about last night.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.745
I know how George feels.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.480
So, for heaven's sake,
why don't you just tell me

20:47.514 --> 20:48.648
how do you feel?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.786
I feel like we should keep on
doing what we did last night.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.955
You know, you could
use the practice,

20:55.988 --> 20:58.825
and it wasn't
so bad for me.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.059
But like I told you before,

21:00.092 --> 21:03.696
I have no interest in going all
John Wayne with George Tucker

21:03.730 --> 21:05.898
to be your boyfriend.

21:05.932 --> 21:06.966
Enjoy your fries.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.774
Oh, Lemonade, I was
getting worried about you.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.844
Now I hate to bother you with
this, but we cannot find the box

21:17.877 --> 21:20.547
for this cake knife that
Shula Whitaker brought over.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.914
Are you okay?

21:21.948 --> 21:24.984
Of course I'm not okay.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.052
And it's your fault.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.687
Not George's?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.989
I mean, somehow I figured maybe
it was just George's fault.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.824
It's your fault
that I don't have a Plan B.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.826
I mean, why didn't
you ever encourage me

21:33.860 --> 21:35.695
to be something
other than a wife?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.564
I mean, why didn't
you encourage me to be...

21:37.597 --> 21:38.998
I don't know,
a doctor like yourself?

21:39.031 --> 21:40.600
Oh, you want
to be a doctor?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.435
You are afraid
of bodily fluids.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.936
I am 30 years old.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.838
And I've never
even lived on my own.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.708
I went from this house
to my sorority house,

21:48.741 --> 21:49.942
then back
to this house.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.844
And, now, thanks to you,
I don't have a job,

21:51.878 --> 21:53.680
which means I can't
afford my own apartment,

21:53.713 --> 21:55.114
which means I'm
going to live here

21:55.147 --> 21:56.549
until the day that I die?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.618
Which for the both of us,
I hope comes soon!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.086
Lemon, calm down.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.588
Look, let me get you
some sweet tea.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.989
I don't want
your sweet tea!

22:03.022 --> 22:04.557
You know what, Daddy?

22:04.591 --> 22:06.693
I don't want one more second
of you coddling me!

22:06.726 --> 22:07.960
You know what,
I'll return that to Shula.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.497
Seems like a mindless,
domestic errand.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.598
Right up my alley.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.402
(exhales)

22:18.938 --> 22:21.708
(phone line ringing)

22:21.741 --> 22:22.975
Emily, hey.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.877
It's Brick.

22:24.911 --> 22:25.945
(chuckles)

22:25.978 --> 22:28.615
You know, upon reflection,
I do believe my daughter

22:28.648 --> 22:30.783
is gonna need some space
after all,

22:30.817 --> 22:33.386
and-and, you know,
I was just wondering

22:33.420 --> 22:36.923
maybe, uh,
are you still free tonight?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.893
LAVON:
What's all this?

22:40.927 --> 22:44.030
Takeout from Fancy's.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.898
Could you get me
some wine glasses?

22:45.932 --> 22:47.166
(chuckles)

22:47.199 --> 22:48.735
What's the occasion?

22:48.768 --> 22:52.405
Wait, don't tell me
you made your choice already?

22:52.439 --> 22:53.873
Oh, no.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.643
I finally made a
girlfriend, thank God.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.746
And she's coming over, so she
will know what I should do.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.481
A girlfriend?
Mm-hmm.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.149
Ha ha, good for you.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.951
And me.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.819
Mostly me.

23:06.853 --> 23:07.787
You can skedaddle.
I don't need

23:07.820 --> 23:09.922
your advice anymore
now that I have Ruby.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.159
She's only in town for a few
days, so I need to milk her

23:13.192 --> 23:14.661
for all the girl talk
I can.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.828
Did you say...
Hey, Lavon.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.764
...Ruby?
(screaming)

23:17.797 --> 23:18.565
Oh.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.832
Um...

23:19.866 --> 23:20.967
Ha.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.902
I take it
you two know each other.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.505
Yeah, Lavon and I
dated in high school.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.639
Yeah, hey.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.508
Hi, Ruby.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.042
No way.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.812
I'm gonna go change this,
and then you two are going

23:32.845 --> 23:35.181
to tell me all about it.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.016
But super quick because
then we're talking all about me.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.891
Would you like some wine?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.974
What's up, Tucker?

24:02.008 --> 24:03.943
Peace offering?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.979
This is, uh,

24:07.013 --> 24:08.214
obviously an awkward situation,

24:08.247 --> 24:10.850
but you and I have been buds
for a long time,

24:10.883 --> 24:14.887
so I just want to say that
no matter who Zoe chooses...

24:14.921 --> 24:15.955
You and I will be solid.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.824
Good.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.092
Good. I also just wanted to say

24:20.126 --> 24:21.227
that, um, actually,

24:21.260 --> 24:22.962
I have real strong feelings
for her.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.764
So, I-I'm all in.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.098
All right.
So, it's not exactly

24:26.132 --> 24:28.701
gonna be the easiest
of competitions

24:28.735 --> 24:30.570
for you there.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.671
Hey, George.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.741
Think you want to come out here.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.782
Oh, good,

24:42.815 --> 24:44.050
you're home.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.664
Hi-ya!

24:57.697 --> 24:59.866
(groans)

24:59.899 --> 25:02.301
What on earth
are you doing?

25:02.334 --> 25:03.870
Defending myself.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.037
Aren't you here to kill me?

25:06.706 --> 25:08.040
No.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.776
You idiot.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.745
I'm here because, um,
I can't breathe,

25:12.779 --> 25:14.046
and, um, okay,

25:14.080 --> 25:15.314
my chest hurts.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.083
And I'm having a heart attack.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.084
Okay, come sit down.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.886
Here, I'll get my
medical bag.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.788
Do you want me
to call your dad?

25:21.821 --> 25:24.023
No, I do not want you
to call my father.

25:24.056 --> 25:27.226
I cannot stand one more minute
of that man's coddling.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.895
Which is why

25:28.928 --> 25:32.932
I'm gonna spend my last moments
on this earth with you,

25:32.965 --> 25:36.202
my sworn enemy, the woman
about to run off with my fiancé.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.904
(gasps)

25:37.937 --> 25:39.839
(panting)

25:39.872 --> 25:41.207
GEORGE:
 Okay, and you're sure

25:41.240 --> 25:43.776
that you saw Lemon
go into the carriage house?

25:43.810 --> 25:47.179
Yeah, that's a pretty
unmistakable silhouette.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.917
(chuckles)
I'm sure she just wanted to chat
with Zoe about something.

25:50.950 --> 25:51.751
They got a lot to talk about.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.220
Got to say, it's
pretty interesting.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.956
(phone rings)

25:56.989 --> 25:58.257
Yeah?

25:58.290 --> 25:59.926
George, it's Bill. Listen,

25:59.959 --> 26:01.928
Eugenia Todd tells me
she saw Lemon

26:01.961 --> 26:04.063
walking through town,
holding a knife.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.798
A knife?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.066
So, you might want

26:07.099 --> 26:08.034
to be on the lookout,

26:08.067 --> 26:10.336
just in case she's not going
to slice a cake

26:10.369 --> 26:12.071
and you're her target.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.940
Right, um, Sheriff,
you know what?

26:13.973 --> 26:16.208
You might just want to come on
down to the mayor's plantation

26:16.242 --> 26:18.344
because Lemon and her knife
are at Zoe Hart's place.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.079
Thanks.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.249
Whoo. Man.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.284
Things are getting more
interesting by the minute.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.087
Ooh.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.856
You look wonderful.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.090
Success suits you.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.692
Likewise.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.227
Done really nice
for yourself, too.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.996
I mean, who would have thought

26:37.029 --> 26:39.231
Lavon Hayes
would move back to town,

26:39.265 --> 26:40.767
much less become the mayor.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.835
Life can take some
unexpected turns.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.403
I mean, in high school,

26:44.436 --> 26:47.273
we both just wanted
to get up out of here.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.041
And here we are.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.877
To unexpected turns.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.411
(chuckles)

26:52.444 --> 26:53.880
Come on.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.748
Unexpected turns.

26:58.685 --> 27:01.854
We had a pretty great run there
for a while, didn't we?

27:01.888 --> 27:02.922
We sure did.
Yeah.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.258
All that entire summer
before you left for 'Bama.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.994
Was magical.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.029
It was. (laughs)
I remember

27:10.062 --> 27:12.031
the last day we spent together
like it was yesterday.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.867
So do I. We, uh, we
drove to Gulf Shores,

27:14.901 --> 27:16.268
watched the sun come up.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.403
And you kissed me

27:17.436 --> 27:20.439
and told me
we'd be together forever

27:20.472 --> 27:22.041
and that you'd call me

27:22.074 --> 27:25.144
as soon as you got settled
into your dorm.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.013
Must have been so hard for you,

27:27.046 --> 27:29.682
being away from home
for the very first time

27:29.716 --> 27:33.019
with absolutely
no telephone access.

27:33.052 --> 27:36.222
Um... I'm sorry.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.158
Yeah, I got busy, you
know, with football.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.894
Yeah, I waited for you
for months.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.330
No one would even date me in my
senior class 'cause everybody

27:44.363 --> 27:45.965
knew I was Lavon Hayes' girl.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.299
But I wasn't, was I?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.769
You had moved on.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.938
You just couldn't handle
a difficult conversation.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.940
(groans) Where is Zoe?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.908
How long does it take
to change a shirt?

27:55.942 --> 27:57.977
You know, I should
go check on her. Yeah.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.712
I'll be back in a bit.
Seriously?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.347
(sighs)

28:01.380 --> 28:03.449
Just tell Zoe
I'll call her later.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.952
Okay.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.988
I'm not waiting any longer.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.322
I'm going in.
Oh, there's a plan.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.058
Yeah, I'm sure the girl
with the knife would love

28:12.091 --> 28:13.459
to talk with the guy who
pushed her over the edge.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.928
Hey, you guys seen Zoe?

28:15.962 --> 28:17.930
She said she was
gonna change her shirt.

28:17.964 --> 28:18.931
She never came back.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.232
She's entertaining.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.868
Lemon...

28:21.901 --> 28:23.269
who has a knife.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.271
A what now?
I'm going over there.
Yeah.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.405
You are not. You are

28:26.438 --> 28:28.407
the last person Lemon needs
to be seeing right now.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.342
What does Lavon have
to do with all this?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.012
Interestinger
and interestinger.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.814
It's not a heart attack.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.082
Take the Valium.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.516
No.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.951
I'm not having a panic attack.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.820
It-it is my heart.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.955
All right, it must be
a latent condition.

28:42.989 --> 28:45.091
You are a terrible doctor.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.093
I'm telling you, Lemon,
your vitals are stable.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.996
You are a healthy,
30-year-old woman

28:50.029 --> 28:51.297
with no history
of heart disease.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.365
Given everything
that's been going on,

28:53.399 --> 28:55.768
a panic attack
isn't exactly a surprise.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.236
You ruined my life,
so don't you dare

28:57.269 --> 28:58.270
feel sorry for me.
I don't.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.239
Because you
are just having

29:00.272 --> 29:02.909
a run-of-the-mill
panic attack.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.044
Take the Valium.
No.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.379
If I'm having a panic attack,
that just means

29:07.413 --> 29:09.115
I'm the fragile mess
that everybody thinks

29:09.148 --> 29:11.150
that I am, and I'm not a mess.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.985
(sighs)

29:13.019 --> 29:13.920
Lemon, take the pill.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.855
I promise,
it will make you feel better.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.189
No one will ever know.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.027
(sirens wailing)
Oh, thank goodness.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.261
Sheriff Bill, all right.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.562
Don't worry, guys.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.031
You're in good hands.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.899
Now, the most important thing

29:26.933 --> 29:29.401
is that we keep
the situation contained.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.536
No one panic.

29:30.569 --> 29:31.938
(radio chirps)

29:31.971 --> 29:34.040
Web search: kidnapping

29:34.073 --> 29:34.974
with a lethal weapon.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.944
MECHANICAL VOICE:
Searching the Web for...

29:37.977 --> 29:41.147
kidnapping with a lethal weapon.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.482
I'm glad you could
come out tonight.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.584
It is good to get out.
It's been a while for me.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.886
But delightful

29:46.919 --> 29:48.420
dinner companions
don't come along

29:48.454 --> 29:49.488
all that often.
TOM: Dr. Breeland?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.924
I spent a lot...

29:51.958 --> 29:53.192
Dr. Breeland?

29:53.225 --> 29:55.361
You know, Tom Long,

29:55.394 --> 29:56.562
this better be serious

29:56.595 --> 30:00.032
like the sudden onset of a
flesh-eating virus or something.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.834
The sheriff's looking for you.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.103
Lemon took Zoe hostage.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.975
This'll just take
one minute, maybe two.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.542
Uh, be right back.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.080
Did y'all hear that?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.215
It's BlueBell's
first ever hostage crisis.

30:31.097 --> 30:31.864
DASH:
 Attention, Blawkerites,
 the whole town is

30:31.898 --> 30:34.000
gathered outside
 Zoe Hart's house

30:34.033 --> 30:36.202
in what has become BlueBell's
 first hostage crisis.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.071
I just called Lemon
to ask for her list of demands.
Okay.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.539
She's not answering.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.341
No worries; I got this.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.476
Sometimes you just got
to ask yourself,

30:44.510 --> 30:46.545
"What would
John McClane do?"

30:46.578 --> 30:48.881
Where is that air vent?

30:48.915 --> 30:50.149
WADE:
Hey, hey, where you going?

30:50.182 --> 30:51.650
In. I'm worried.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.120
Look, I told you, you're only
gonna make it worse, all right?

30:54.153 --> 30:55.387
I'll go in.
No.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.555
You're not gonna go in there.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.423
This is my problem.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.391
See, it's your fault,
not your problem.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.859
I'm going.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.263
Hey, Wade, hey,
don't you dare.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.532
George, we don't have 15 years
for you to make your move,

31:06.565 --> 31:07.900
all right,
it's not what they need.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.101
Yeah, and I'm sure
you know exactly

31:09.135 --> 31:10.269
what the two of them need

31:10.302 --> 31:11.237
right now.
Trust me, brother,

31:11.270 --> 31:13.005
I know exactly what they need,
or at least,

31:13.039 --> 31:14.640
that's one of them told
me the other night

31:14.673 --> 31:16.175
right after round three, so...

31:17.443 --> 31:19.912
(crowd yelling)

31:22.614 --> 31:24.616
WOMAN:
Get him, George, get him.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.189
Well, your pulse
is back to normal.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.991
The panic attack is over.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.060
Great.

31:34.093 --> 31:37.063
I can go on living my stupid,
miserable life.

31:37.096 --> 31:37.997
Come on, Lemon.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.398
You may be a snobby New Yorker

31:39.431 --> 31:41.700
with horrible fashion sense,
but...

31:41.733 --> 31:44.603
I mean, at least you have

31:44.636 --> 31:45.704
a career.

31:45.737 --> 31:49.075
I've been with George Tucker
for 15 years of my life,

31:49.108 --> 31:52.444
and I don't even know
who I am without him.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.413
Never been single.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.683
Never been on my own.

31:57.716 --> 32:01.487
I'm as much a mess
as they think I am.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.590
Lemon, I may have a career,
but believe me,

32:04.623 --> 32:07.960
my life is just as much
a mess as yours.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.428
The whole town

32:09.461 --> 32:11.697
thinks I'm a home wrecker.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.966
I only have one friend,

32:14.000 --> 32:15.434
and did I mention

32:15.467 --> 32:16.969
that I had sex with
Wade last night?

32:17.003 --> 32:18.070
No.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.708
(screams)

32:22.741 --> 32:24.276
Did you just bite me?

32:25.744 --> 32:29.515
We're both going through
major life changes right now.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.716
You maybe

32:30.749 --> 32:32.618
a little more than me.

32:32.651 --> 32:33.485
And that panic attack

32:33.519 --> 32:36.055
was your body telling you
that today

32:36.088 --> 32:37.323
might not be the best day

32:37.356 --> 32:39.058
for big changes.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.060
We need to take our time.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.462
Baby steps.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.596
Sometimes,

32:44.630 --> 32:46.465
it's about baby steps.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.000
Baby steps.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.636
I'll walk you out.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.005
(crowd yelling)

32:54.706 --> 32:56.408
This is so confusing.
Why are these two fighting?

32:56.442 --> 32:57.476
Okay, I have a new theory.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.645
Lemon slept with Wade, and
George, seeking revenge,

32:59.678 --> 33:01.613
slept with...
BRICK:
Come on. Knock it off.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.082
Knock it off. This
is not helping matters.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.351
Well, he started it!
No, I finished it.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.519
Hey, hey, hey.
There they are!

33:07.553 --> 33:08.487
(crowd exclaiming)

33:08.520 --> 33:10.656
Oh, my God, they know!

33:10.689 --> 33:12.424
Everybody knows.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.759
We don't know
what they know.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.095
Lemon Breeland,
you are under arrest

33:16.128 --> 33:18.364
for kidnapping Dr. Hart
with a deadly weapon.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.366
Okay. So they know that.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.767
Come out with your hands up!

33:21.800 --> 33:25.237
Sheriff Bill, this has been
a big misunderstanding.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.373
Lemon didn't kidnap me;
we were just hanging out.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.641
It's a kind of new
thing, we're pals.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.043
But Le...

33:31.077 --> 33:33.045
But Lemon's got a knife.

33:33.079 --> 33:36.082
A wedding present I was all set
to return to Shula Whitaker.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.118
And here she is,

33:39.151 --> 33:40.119
weirdly.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.054
SHERIFF BILL:
Oh, man.

33:42.088 --> 33:45.057
I was finally going
to solve a real crime.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.058
All right.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.659
Go on back home, everybody.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.128
Go on back home.

33:49.161 --> 33:50.129
But now, now,
now, Sheriff,

33:50.162 --> 33:51.297
we need some answers.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.732
Now, if Lemon did
not try to kill Zoe

33:53.765 --> 33:55.401
because she had an affair

33:55.434 --> 33:57.436
with George Tucker,

33:57.469 --> 34:01.573
then why, why did George
and Lemon break up?

34:01.607 --> 34:02.674
Was it Wade?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.743
No. It was actually all my...

34:04.776 --> 34:06.778
It was no one's...

34:07.846 --> 34:10.047
It was no one's fault.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.085
There was no one person

34:14.120 --> 34:15.587
responsible
for the breakup.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.623
At the end of the
day, it just...

34:18.657 --> 34:19.791
wasn't meant to be.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.830
All right, you two,
shake and make up.

34:24.862 --> 34:28.734
Come on, now.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.806
SHERIFF BILL:
Good.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.447
Thank you.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.114
For saving my life.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.217
I mean, I still hate you,

34:45.251 --> 34:46.585
and I'll hate you
until your dying day,

34:46.618 --> 34:49.721
but... listen, if you
want to date George Tucker,

34:49.755 --> 34:52.123
then you don't have
to hide it from me.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.493
I mean, don't consider
this a blessing,

34:54.525 --> 34:56.328
it's just that...

34:56.362 --> 35:01.667
I have been through the worst
public humiliation twice

35:01.700 --> 35:03.469
in two days.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.870
There is nothing that you,

35:04.903 --> 35:06.638
or George,

35:06.672 --> 35:08.407
or anyone can do

35:08.440 --> 35:09.775
that will break me.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.889
Are you okay?

35:23.922 --> 35:25.824
It has been a doozy
of a night.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.893
But I'm okay.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.928
I'm relieved, actually.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.732
Because I finally know
what I'm going to do.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.451
Hey.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.885
Thanks for meeting me here.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.223
Well, then, I take it
you made your choice.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.158
George, I'm sorry.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.564
Wow...

36:05.597 --> 36:07.599
Wow.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.437
You are picking Wade.
No.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.940
No, Wade... just helped me
get through your wedding day.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.676
Apparently, that's it.

36:17.709 --> 36:18.844
I'm choosing no one.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.349
Why?
Because, George,

36:23.382 --> 36:25.484
as much as I would love to

36:25.517 --> 36:28.720
ride off into the
sunset with you,

36:28.754 --> 36:30.856
right now it's
a recipe for disaster.

36:30.889 --> 36:31.723
Look, Zoe...

36:31.757 --> 36:34.326
I told you, I will
never hurt you again.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.362
Maybe not intentionally.

36:36.395 --> 36:40.566
But you just got out of
a 15-year relationship.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.701
That's half your life.

36:42.734 --> 36:46.772
You don't know who
you are without Lemon.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.774
But I know how
I feel about you,

36:48.807 --> 36:50.909
and I know that
we can make this work.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.345
I've never been in
a real relationship.

36:53.379 --> 36:56.715
You've never even dated.

36:56.748 --> 36:59.851
I'm thinking that you...
you probably should.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.754
George, I can't be
your rebound.

37:02.788 --> 37:03.989
All right, so...

37:04.022 --> 37:07.393
so you're asking me to...

37:07.426 --> 37:08.727
date other people?

37:08.760 --> 37:10.996
As crazy as that sounds,

37:11.029 --> 37:12.431
yeah.

37:13.499 --> 37:16.935
One day soon, the
stars will align,

37:16.968 --> 37:19.871
and you will be single,

37:19.905 --> 37:21.640
and healed, and so will I.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.609
But what if it doesn't
work like that?

37:23.642 --> 37:25.777
We have to hope
that it will.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.781
(sighs)

37:29.815 --> 37:31.817
*

37:38.924 --> 37:40.859
BRICK:
Morning, sugar.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.363
(sighs)

37:44.396 --> 37:45.797
You didn't come
home last night.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.699
I stayed at AnnaBeth's.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.935
She doesn't coddle me.
(laughs)

37:49.968 --> 37:52.571
Well, unless I tell her to.
I see.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.906
How are you?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.709
Determined.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.545
To get a job,

37:59.578 --> 38:00.946
to get out of your house,

38:00.979 --> 38:02.514
to move on with my life.

38:02.548 --> 38:03.782
Well, I would
love to help.

38:03.815 --> 38:04.983
In any way I can.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.852
Thank you.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.286
But you've done enough.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.922
Lemon...

38:10.956 --> 38:11.957
you don't...
Daddy...

38:12.958 --> 38:14.926
I love you.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.829
And I have to get out
from under your wings,

38:17.863 --> 38:19.498
otherwise I'm just gonna
suffocate in there.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.968
So, please...

38:23.001 --> 38:24.302
let me.

38:30.742 --> 38:31.943
You know, Lemon...

38:31.977 --> 38:33.812
(clears throat)
there's a job opening here,

38:33.845 --> 38:34.746
if you want it.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.115
Lemon Breeland is
not waitress material.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.850
No. No, she is not.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.853
But I reckon we'd be willing
to give you a shot anyway.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.089
Lemon, it's a job.
All right?

38:44.122 --> 38:46.992
It's dirty, you got to take
crap from people all day long,

38:47.025 --> 38:48.960
but it's honest work.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.696
And what better way to
show the town of BlueBell

38:50.729 --> 38:52.731
that you are willing to do
whatever it takes to start over?

38:53.732 --> 38:54.933
Besides...

38:54.966 --> 38:57.869
it would give me such pleasure
to boss you around for once.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.974
(clears throat)

39:03.008 --> 39:04.710
May I take your request?

39:04.743 --> 39:06.712
"Order."

39:06.745 --> 39:09.848
Yeah. Well,
we'll see about that.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.517
That's my girl.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.786
LAVON:
Hey, Ruby.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.787
There you are.

39:15.821 --> 39:16.855
Hey.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.524
Uh... you mind?

39:18.557 --> 39:20.526
Sure.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.800
Look, Ruby, um...

39:28.834 --> 39:29.835
You know, in high school,

39:29.868 --> 39:31.803
you had me wrapped around
your little finger.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.173
I mean, I was
powerless around you.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.176
So I thought if I ever
tried to break up with you,

39:38.209 --> 39:40.612
well, somehow you'd
just talk me out of it.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.013
It was easier to

39:42.047 --> 39:43.549
avoid the subject.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.551
And avoid you.

39:47.719 --> 39:52.023
But yeah, that was
an immature, cowardly move

39:52.057 --> 39:53.592
and I apologize.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.563
Apology accepted.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.566
(laughs)
Thank you.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.801
(laughs)

40:02.834 --> 40:04.736
Oh...

40:06.472 --> 40:08.206
Well, then, uh...

40:08.239 --> 40:09.841
Can I buy you one drink,

40:09.875 --> 40:12.210
before you disappear for
another decade or two?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.945
Well, Lavon,
you'll actually have

40:13.979 --> 40:15.981
plenty of opportunities
to buy me drinks.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.716
I've decided to
stick around for a while.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.920
You... you staying?
Yeah.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.955
Ah... Why?

40:23.989 --> 40:26.057
'Cause I have a lot
of time on my hands,

40:26.091 --> 40:27.926
and nothing would
give me more pleasure

40:27.959 --> 40:29.461
than to mess with your mind.

40:30.829 --> 40:31.963
(laughing)

40:31.997 --> 40:32.964
Kidding.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.733
(forced laugh)

40:34.766 --> 40:37.202
My grandmama wants me to stay
and help her out for a while.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.437
That's all.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.973
Bye.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.645
*

40:49.114 --> 40:51.483
Hey.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.585
Thought you would've ridden
off into the sunset by now.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.588
It's not going to work out
with George.

40:56.622 --> 40:57.856
For now.
I get it.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.559
Why settle for the four-cylinder
when you've just ridden a V8?

41:00.592 --> 41:02.761
Right? I just hope I haven't
ruined you for all men.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.963
I chose nobody, you ass.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.032
My hat wasn't even in the ring.

41:07.065 --> 41:10.235
Although...
I suppose my pants could be.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.970
You've got to be kidding.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.271
No way.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.040
Look, I just figure,
you know, you're single.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.875
You could take me up
on that tutorial.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.510
Maybe get your grade up
from the B-minus.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.145
I don't need
a tutorial.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.013
Sure.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.515
I know what you're doing.

41:23.549 --> 41:25.984
But I am a strong

41:26.017 --> 41:27.586
and confident woman, Wade.

41:27.619 --> 41:30.622
And I know that, from
the fact that I have had sex

41:30.656 --> 41:32.524
with no less than
four other men--

41:32.558 --> 41:34.793
none of whom complained--

41:34.826 --> 41:36.728
that I am great in bed.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.797
Great! Just like I am
at everything else I do!

41:38.830 --> 41:40.899
I don't have anything
to prove to you.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.167
You got that?

41:46.037 --> 41:47.172
This doesn't mean anything.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.173
You get that?

41:48.206 --> 41:50.542
I don't like you.

41:50.576 --> 41:51.910
Yeah, see, uh...

41:51.943 --> 41:53.545
I don't really care.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.013
Just admit that
I'm not a B-minus.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.882
No.

41:56.915 --> 42:00.151
But I do know how you could
make up a little extra credit.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.788
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
