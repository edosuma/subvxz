WEBVTT

00:07.357 --> 00:10.292
This is for your father.
Loaded with antioxidants

00:10.326 --> 00:11.623
and good for his heart muscle.

00:11.661 --> 00:14.697
Ignacio Suarez drinking
pomegranate juice.

00:14.697 --> 00:18.657
He used to hate this stuff.
Elena, you are a miracle worker.

00:18.702 --> 00:21.000
Just doing my job. Try it.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.005
- Mmm...
- Mmm.

00:28.012 --> 00:29.877
Pomegranate juice was my idea,
you know.

00:29.913 --> 00:31.245
Oh, here we go.

00:31.283 --> 00:34.514
Way before it was in the stores.
Way before.

00:34.586 --> 00:37.714
And now some lady who stole my idea
is living in a mansion in Beverly Hills.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.051
I should be in Beverly Hills.

00:39.090 --> 00:41.058
No, I should be living in Beverly Hills.

00:41.092 --> 00:43.356
You don't want to live
in Beverly Hills, okay?

00:43.395 --> 00:45.193
I worked there for a year.

00:45.231 --> 00:49.099
Bunch of stuck-up old hags with
pulled-up faces. And their wives.

00:50.202 --> 00:52.670
<i>Good morning, familia!</i>

00:52.705 --> 00:57.074
It's a beautiful 30-degree day
in Queens, New York.

00:57.109 --> 01:00.978
Perfect weather for a brisky,
blood-pumping walk.

01:01.014 --> 01:02.948
I don't think "brisky" is a word.

01:02.983 --> 01:04.177
It is today.

01:04.217 --> 01:07.084
Ignacio, you gotta drink your juice
before your walk.

01:07.154 --> 01:10.555
Crazy idea. We can drink
and walk at the same time.

01:11.792 --> 01:15.125
- Have a nice walk!
- Yeah, have fun!

01:15.897 --> 01:18.832
Wow, I am so happy!

01:18.866 --> 01:22.393
<i>I can't believe how quickly papi has
bounced back from his heart attack.</i>

01:22.437 --> 01:24.928
I know. And how great is Elena?

01:24.972 --> 01:29.932
She's like the big sister I never had.
Now I know how important I am to you.

01:29.977 --> 01:31.878
Hmm. Well, she is amazing.

01:32.981 --> 01:34.608
And it's just
so nice not to have to worry.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.311
I know. I'll see you later.

01:36.352 --> 01:37.376
Mrs. Meade?

01:37.419 --> 01:38.750
Good morning, Betty.

01:38.787 --> 01:41.984
I tried to reach Daniel.
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

01:42.057 --> 01:46.586
Could you come to the drugstore
at 58th and Lex? And bring some cash.

01:47.664 --> 01:49.791
There's been a misunderstanding.

01:51.501 --> 01:56.803
I apprehended the suspect
leaving the store with this in her purse.

01:58.074 --> 02:02.603
Okay. Well, first of all, you don't have to
call her a suspect. It's Claire Meade.

02:02.646 --> 02:05.672
I don't care who she is.
Woman got the sticky fingers.

02:05.716 --> 02:08.116
Mrs. Meade,
did you shoplift?

02:08.151 --> 02:11.588
Betty, it is not shoplifting
if you can afford the item

02:11.622 --> 02:14.352
but simply
do not have the funds on you.

02:15.660 --> 02:19.027
Wait, what? That...
I think that is shoplifting.

02:19.698 --> 02:22.064
Well, we could debate this all day.

02:22.100 --> 02:27.037
Betty, why don't you pay the man
his $24 and we'll be on our way?

02:27.072 --> 02:29.063
Curtis, have a nice day.

02:31.377 --> 02:34.642
Shoplifting?
I don't even know what that means.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.614
Yeah, neither did your mother.

02:36.649 --> 02:38.879
Look, do you think something
could be going on with her?

02:38.918 --> 02:41.648
Something that could be provoking
all of this?

02:41.687 --> 02:42.915
Well...

02:43.556 --> 02:45.581
- Oh!
- Oh?

02:45.691 --> 02:49.150
Yeah, six-oh, actually.
It's her 60th birthday next week.

02:49.229 --> 02:50.787
Wow.
Well, that could freak someone out.

02:50.864 --> 02:52.832
Maybe she just needs a little attention.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.097
You know, I always tell her she doesn't
get out enough and meet people.

02:56.136 --> 02:59.765
Hey!
We could throw her a surprise party!

03:00.875 --> 03:03.901
That's a good idea.
You know what? She loves a party.

03:03.945 --> 03:07.039
You know what else we could do?
A tribute video.

03:07.949 --> 03:11.214
A tribute video, wow!
That sounds like a lot of work.

03:11.252 --> 03:12.651
That's okay, I could do it.

03:12.687 --> 03:14.052
- Really?
- Yeah!

03:14.088 --> 03:16.785
I mean, your mom has always
been so great to me and my family.

03:16.826 --> 03:18.316
I want to do this for her.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.329
Do you have any old home movies
I can watch?

03:27.436 --> 03:33.239
<i>Joy to the world
and all that stuff!</i>

03:34.077 --> 03:38.537
<i>Let's see how much dough
Santa spent!</i>

03:46.691 --> 03:48.591
<i>Oh, my balls.</i>

03:50.061 --> 03:52.723
<i>This tree is over-decorated.</i>

03:59.437 --> 04:01.906
Wow, it's kind of hard to watch it.

04:01.940 --> 04:06.934
Yeah, also kind of hard to live it.
And they're all pretty much the same.

04:06.979 --> 04:10.107
Though the Fourth of July
barbecue-in-the-pool spectacular

04:10.148 --> 04:11.843
is pretty damn entertaining.

04:11.884 --> 04:14.614
Yikes. Well, I'm sure
I can find something in here.

04:14.653 --> 04:16.017
And, hey, if you get me a camera,

04:16.053 --> 04:19.081
I could interview her friends and family
saying nice things about her

04:19.125 --> 04:21.821
and then edit that into
a warm, wonderful video.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.055
Great.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.587
- Hello, Daniel.
- Mrs. Meade!

04:25.632 --> 04:27.930
Hey, Mom.
I was just coming to see you.

04:28.001 --> 04:32.063
I know, I know, I'm due for a talking-to

04:32.139 --> 04:35.165
after my little bout
with the drug-store police this morning.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.574
But I thought it might be more pleasant
to do it over dinner.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.580
- How about Michael's at 8:00?
- That sounds great, but I...

04:40.614 --> 04:44.641
Great! I'll call and see if he'll make
your favorite, spaghetti and meatballs.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.084
What? They're good.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.817
Hey, Mom, you know,
I'd really love to do that,

04:48.857 --> 04:51.883
but Molly has a surprise
special date planned.

04:53.128 --> 04:54.356
Oh.

04:54.396 --> 04:55.624
Well, that's fine, then.

04:55.664 --> 04:59.225
But, you know, we should do
something fun together,

04:59.267 --> 05:01.736
maybe just later in the week.

05:01.771 --> 05:03.500
That would be nice.

05:08.044 --> 05:11.309
- We better make sure this party's good.
- Oh, we will.

05:13.282 --> 05:14.772
Justin!

05:16.152 --> 05:19.884
Justin. How do I know
if this thing is on?

05:19.923 --> 05:23.586
You see the red light?
If it's on, then you're recording.

05:24.828 --> 05:26.193
How did you know that?

05:26.229 --> 05:29.323
I'm a teenager.
Technology doesn't faze me.

05:29.366 --> 05:32.928
Betty, what are you doing
with that camera?

05:32.971 --> 05:34.666
Are you filming something?

05:35.273 --> 05:39.835
Yes, Hilda. I am.
Which you obviously know

05:39.911 --> 05:43.711
because you are dressed
like J-Lo on the red carpet.

05:43.748 --> 05:47.742
What are you talking about?
I always act like this.

05:47.786 --> 05:48.810
- Mom.
- What?

05:48.854 --> 05:51.152
If we're doing home movies,
I want to look good.

05:51.190 --> 05:53.215
I want my grandchildren
to see how hot I was.

05:53.258 --> 05:55.192
- Disturbing.
- Please.

05:55.227 --> 05:57.388
We're not really making home videos,
I'm just practicing.

05:57.429 --> 05:58.953
But I promise,
when I'm done with Claire's video,

05:58.998 --> 06:00.761
you can get all glammed up again.
Okay?

06:00.799 --> 06:02.199
All right.

06:02.235 --> 06:04.795
- How do I turn this off?
- Red button.

06:09.709 --> 06:11.301
Want me to do your hair?
No.

06:11.378 --> 06:12.640
Come on.

06:15.181 --> 06:18.982
You know, I'm not really sure
this was a good idea.

06:19.020 --> 06:21.545
Well, loosen up.
It'll all come back to you.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.079
Yeah, but I never really learned
how to skate.

06:23.124 --> 06:25.319
I was always the kid
with the double blades on.

06:27.395 --> 06:29.693
No, look, you're doing great!

06:29.730 --> 06:31.891
Whoa. This isn't so bad!

06:32.934 --> 06:34.128
But...

06:35.971 --> 06:38.735
Watch what you're doing,
you dumbass!

06:39.875 --> 06:41.035
You.

06:48.818 --> 06:51.013
- Well, this is awkward.
- Is it?

06:51.054 --> 06:53.887
What, just because my ex-fiancée
is here with her new boyfriend,

06:53.923 --> 06:55.356
who's my mate?

06:55.391 --> 06:56.790
You're here with your girlfriend.

06:56.826 --> 06:59.386
You know what? We've been skating
for a while. We're gonna go.

06:59.429 --> 07:00.862
No, you stay, we'll go.

07:00.897 --> 07:03.366
Oi! Look, this is ridiculous.

07:04.568 --> 07:07.833
Come on, what's the big deal?
We're all grown-ups.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.941
It was in Bhutan,
winter of 2002,

07:12.976 --> 07:14.739
we took the elephants up into the hills.

07:14.812 --> 07:17.873
It was 2006, actually.
Remember how weird that guide was?

07:17.949 --> 07:19.541
Oh, he was a freak!

07:20.785 --> 07:22.150
And then it got dark.

07:22.721 --> 07:27.454
The elephants! We slept
in the forest with the elephants.

07:27.492 --> 07:30.825
Yeah, and then it rained
all the way back.

07:31.730 --> 07:35.167
And Molly gets these terrible rashes
from wet clothes.

07:35.201 --> 07:38.534
Awful giant red blotches.

07:39.872 --> 07:43.035
I could only imagine. Are they painful?

07:43.075 --> 07:45.202
So, of course,
Molly went home disappointed.

07:45.244 --> 07:47.109
Well, I had hoped
to make it up to Tibet.

07:47.146 --> 07:52.608
We never got the chance. I've always
wanted to go and the food is incredible!

07:52.652 --> 07:56.782
I didn't know they had food.
I mean, Tibetan food. Who knew?

07:59.092 --> 08:00.423
It's getting late.

08:00.460 --> 08:03.259
Yeah, it's 7:30,
so we should probably...

08:03.297 --> 08:05.663
- Are you ready?
- Never been more.

08:10.238 --> 08:12.297
Oh, Daniel! Great! I'm glad you're here.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.137
I want to interview you
for your mom's video.

08:14.175 --> 08:15.665
Yeah, before we do that,
can we check to see

08:15.710 --> 08:17.906
if there are any direct flights,
JFK to Tibet?

08:17.946 --> 08:19.038
Tibet?

08:19.081 --> 08:21.606
Yeah, I just thought it'd be
a nice surprise trip for Molly and me.

08:21.683 --> 08:22.775
She's always wanted to go.

08:22.851 --> 08:26.218
- Wow, that's...
- What, too much?

08:26.255 --> 08:29.691
Kind of. Not to mention
we might run into some visa issues,

08:29.725 --> 08:31.852
a military occupation, civil unrest...

08:31.894 --> 08:34.489
Yeah, but the food is
supposed to be excellent.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.692
Besides, I want to do
something special with Molly.

08:36.732 --> 08:40.066
She has all these amazing memories
with Connor.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.630
Well, you'll get there.
It just takes a little time.

08:43.673 --> 08:44.867
Betty, that's what I'm worried about.

08:44.908 --> 08:46.671
I don't exactly have
the best track record

08:46.709 --> 08:48.701
when it comes to
long-term relationships.

08:48.746 --> 08:52.113
Molly's different. I see you two together.
You will get there.

08:52.149 --> 08:56.711
But it might be a good idea
to start a little closer to home, okay?

08:56.787 --> 08:58.584
You know what?

08:58.689 --> 09:01.089
You're right. Let's do this interview.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.422
Great!

09:03.461 --> 09:05.361
- Hmm. That's weird.
- What?

09:05.397 --> 09:07.422
It won't record.

09:07.465 --> 09:09.057
Maybe 'cause it's full?

09:09.100 --> 09:13.594
Impossible. It's just probably broken.
I only used it for 10 minutes.

09:13.638 --> 09:14.764
Here.

09:17.409 --> 09:18.536
Okay.

09:19.145 --> 09:22.603
No. Not broken. Just a lot of great shots
of your front hall.

09:22.648 --> 09:25.048
Front hall, front hall.

09:25.084 --> 09:29.680
Wait, there's something.
It's your father and... Oh.

09:30.556 --> 09:32.956
- What?
- Nothing.

09:32.992 --> 09:34.460
What?

09:34.728 --> 09:36.491
Uh...

09:37.564 --> 09:39.998
That's just my dad and his nurse.

09:44.171 --> 09:45.195
Oh, my God!

09:47.000 --> 09:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:00.154 --> 10:02.987
- See? There!
- I don't know.

10:03.057 --> 10:06.994
You don't know? You don't know what?
He's grabbing her booty!

10:07.029 --> 10:11.363
It's a very vague area,
sort of her hip, lower backside.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.300
Hilda, he is in there.

10:14.036 --> 10:15.128
Fine!

10:15.170 --> 10:18.834
- We have to talk to Dad.
- And say what?

10:19.509 --> 10:23.001
<i>"Papi, we saw you going
for the junk in your nurse's trunk?"</i>

10:23.046 --> 10:26.846
Yes! She could sue us for harassment.

10:26.883 --> 10:30.341
- Elena is not gonna sue us.
- Well, what if she quits?

10:30.387 --> 10:33.653
Oh, no. No, no, no. We cannot lose her.

10:33.724 --> 10:36.318
See? So then we have to deal with it.

10:37.862 --> 10:41.298
<i>Fine. I'll talk to Elena
and you talk to papi.</i>

10:41.332 --> 10:45.200
<i>- No! Why do I have to talk to papi?
- Yes! 'Cause this was your idea.</i>

10:45.236 --> 10:46.863
What, you think I'm gonna ask Dad

10:46.904 --> 10:50.432
if he's turning into the booty bandit
of Jackson Heights? No.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.033
Okay, fine.

10:55.881 --> 10:59.180
This is a wonderful idea.
I never come into the city anymore.

10:59.217 --> 11:03.587
Yeah, well, I thought it would be really
nice for us to have lunch together.

11:03.623 --> 11:06.717
And there's something
I wanted to ask you.

11:06.793 --> 11:09.523
I'm just not quite sure
how to bring it up.

11:09.896 --> 11:12.797
Did my father grab
a handful of your ass last night?

11:12.832 --> 11:15.232
Of course, sweetheart.
I do miss eating cupcakes.

11:15.268 --> 11:17.930
But why would that be awkward to ask?

11:17.971 --> 11:20.634
Well, 'cause I know Elena's
been pretty strict on your diet.

11:20.674 --> 11:23.472
Oh, hey, since you brought her up,
how are things going with her,

11:23.510 --> 11:24.534
everything okay?

11:24.578 --> 11:26.808
<i>But I wouldn't want to lose you
if papi accidentally slipped</i>

11:26.847 --> 11:28.542
and tried to brace himself on your butt.

11:28.582 --> 11:31.618
Don't worry about your father, Hilda.
He's a lovely man.

11:33.354 --> 11:35.482
Excuse me. Too much pomegranate.

11:35.523 --> 11:38.617
I'm just saying, you know,
we can always get someone else.

11:38.660 --> 11:39.752
Like a male nurse,

11:39.794 --> 11:43.252
if you feel uncomfortable
having a woman around all the time.

11:43.331 --> 11:47.267
No, I'm used to it.
I've got two daughters, remember?

11:47.335 --> 11:49.827
If he got out of line,
you would tell me, right?

11:49.905 --> 11:53.864
You don't have to worry, Hilda.
I mean, I've been doing this for a while.

11:53.909 --> 11:56.639
- I can handle myself just fine.
- All right, I feel better.

11:56.679 --> 11:58.738
'Cause you're so good for him,
and you're good for us,

11:58.781 --> 12:00.373
and I just don't want you to quit.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.782
- I promise. I'm not gonna quit.
- All right.

12:02.818 --> 12:05.413
Honestly, I don't know
what I'd do without her.

12:05.455 --> 12:07.389
I know, Dad. She is great.

12:07.424 --> 12:10.518
Elena is wonderful,
and that's why I think it's important

12:10.560 --> 12:14.394
that we treat her with professional
and appropriate courtesy.

12:15.198 --> 12:18.167
Betty, what's on your mind?

12:19.203 --> 12:21.535
Nothing. Let's go to lunch.

12:25.676 --> 12:29.043
Connor and Molly have trekked
the wilds of South Asia together,

12:29.080 --> 12:31.548
and I haven't even seen
the inside of his apartment.

12:31.582 --> 12:34.074
- Has he ever invited you?
- Of course he has, Marc.

12:34.119 --> 12:36.485
But he lives in Murray Hill.
I'm not a barbarian.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.288
- Willie.
- He's seen her rashes! I mean, my God.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.953
Aren't some things better kept
between you and your dermatologist?

12:42.995 --> 12:45.623
Personally, I'd like to think
that everything underneath that

12:45.664 --> 12:48.098
is pure, unblemished mocha.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.729
Well, I will not be hiking
in some wet, green, buggy climate

12:51.805 --> 12:54.273
where people grow rice.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.775
No way. That's not who I am.

12:58.144 --> 13:02.410
Willie, maybe you want to consider
opening yourself up

13:02.449 --> 13:04.441
just a teensy bit to Connor.

13:04.485 --> 13:07.215
I don't do intimacy.
I tried it once, it didn't work out.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.712
You don't have to reveal
your uncomfortable secrets overnight.

13:10.758 --> 13:12.749
<i>This isn't The Bachelor.</i>

13:14.428 --> 13:18.091
But baby steps.
Going to see his apartment,

13:18.132 --> 13:22.832
letting him know that you really care,
that you want more.

13:25.540 --> 13:28.270
<i>That was really nice, mi hija.
Thank you.</i>

13:28.310 --> 13:30.005
Of course, Dad.

13:30.045 --> 13:31.569
- Where's your bathroom?
- Right there.

13:31.613 --> 13:33.672
Oh. Be right back.

13:34.817 --> 13:36.944
- Betty.
- Mrs. Meade.

13:36.986 --> 13:39.580
My friend, Liz Smith, tells me

13:39.622 --> 13:43.456
that you have wanted to ask her
some questions about me.

13:43.626 --> 13:45.253
Oh, uh...

13:45.628 --> 13:49.462
Thank you. Well, I meant to tell you...

13:49.500 --> 13:54.631
This is the island of Manhattan, Betty.
Anything you think is a secret, isn't.

13:54.705 --> 13:56.434
It's not a secret.

13:57.474 --> 14:00.568
I'm just doing an assignment for YETI.

14:00.611 --> 14:05.640
A video on someone who I admire
in publishing. And I chose you.

14:05.683 --> 14:08.516
I'm very flattered.
Was that your father I saw?

14:08.553 --> 14:12.546
Yes.
We just had a very unsuccessful lunch.

14:12.590 --> 14:13.614
What happened?

14:13.658 --> 14:17.219
He did this weird thing, and I couldn't
bring myself to ask him about it.

14:17.262 --> 14:18.786
What was it?

14:18.830 --> 14:21.857
Really, Mrs. Meade, it's fine.

14:21.901 --> 14:24.734
I'm no stranger to weird behavior, Betty.

14:29.074 --> 14:34.307
Well, we caught him
grabbing his nurse's butt.

14:37.284 --> 14:40.685
Bradford went through the same thing
after his first heart attack.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.917
He could not keep it in his pants.

14:44.991 --> 14:48.688
Night and day.
He would not leave me alone.

14:48.728 --> 14:51.391
Finally, I had to slip him
an extra sedative

14:51.432 --> 14:53.127
so I could get some sleep.

14:56.037 --> 14:59.165
Well, I don't think
I could drug my father.

14:59.207 --> 15:05.044
But I did try talking to him,
and that was awkward, so...

15:05.080 --> 15:09.210
- Would you like me to talk to him?
- Oh. Well, I...

15:09.251 --> 15:12.584
<i>Hello. Buenos días, Mrs. Meade.</i>

15:12.621 --> 15:15.249
<i>Buenos días, Ignacio.</i>

15:15.290 --> 15:16.848
Oh, I was just about to
get a cup of coffee.

15:16.892 --> 15:18.883
Would you care to join me?

15:18.927 --> 15:20.725
Well, sure.

15:21.497 --> 15:22.794
Have fun!

15:29.606 --> 15:31.437
I love it. Thank you.

15:32.008 --> 15:33.407
Well, all set.

15:33.443 --> 15:35.912
I'm meeting tomorrow morning
with the Saatchi brothers in London.

15:35.946 --> 15:40.474
Great. Separate those bastards
from their ad budget. Godspeed.

15:40.818 --> 15:44.754
Of course, I'm gonna miss you.

15:45.489 --> 15:47.956
A lot.

15:52.030 --> 15:54.521
I doubt that.
You've got an issue to put to bed.

15:54.566 --> 15:56.932
But I'd rather be in bed with you...

15:56.968 --> 15:58.458
Feelings. Heart.

15:58.570 --> 16:01.038
...sharing feelings.

16:06.078 --> 16:07.705
Thank you, Marc.

16:08.481 --> 16:12.611
Is there anything I can do for you
while you're away?

16:13.219 --> 16:15.187
Oh, darling. I hate to bother you.

16:15.254 --> 16:18.587
No problem. Really. Whatever it is.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.094
Nice to meet you.

16:26.133 --> 16:29.762
Wilhelmina Slater,
meet Olivia Newton-Bird.

16:31.405 --> 16:33.202
You're kidding, right?

16:33.240 --> 16:35.971
<i>She was a birthday gift
around the time Grease came out.</i>

16:36.010 --> 16:39.878
I had the biggest schoolboy crush
on Miss Newton-John.

16:39.914 --> 16:41.404
I had no idea.

16:41.449 --> 16:45.146
Well, that's because you've never been
around my apartment.

16:47.588 --> 16:49.112
There they are,

16:52.161 --> 16:53.856
my two best birds.

16:54.897 --> 16:57.092
I'll touch base when I land.

16:59.301 --> 17:04.170
Well, hello there.
Olivia Newton-Bird want a cracker?

17:04.873 --> 17:08.105
Pretty Molly!
Pretty Molly! Pretty Molly!

17:12.415 --> 17:14.406
Elena says it's perfectly normal
for someone

17:14.451 --> 17:16.112
<i>who's been through
what papi has to get a little...</i>

17:16.185 --> 17:18.154
Justin, come on, let's go.
... frisky.

17:18.221 --> 17:20.246
- Really?
- She can handle it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:20.323 --> 17:21.848
And she's not gonna quit?

17:21.925 --> 17:25.919
<i>No, thank God.
How did your talk with papi go?</i>

17:27.031 --> 17:28.521
Um...

17:29.233 --> 17:30.427
Betty!

17:30.468 --> 17:32.129
- I couldn't go through with it!
- What?

17:32.169 --> 17:35.570
Hilda! But Claire Meade did.
She talked to him.

17:35.606 --> 17:37.370
And she said
that it was probably better for him

17:37.409 --> 17:39.707
to talk to someone
his own age, anyway,

17:39.745 --> 17:41.178
someone who's not his daughter.

17:41.213 --> 17:42.612
- I can't believe you're such...
- Good morning.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.615
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:44.649 --> 17:46.207
What were you two whispering about?

17:46.251 --> 17:47.411
- Nothing.
- Nothing, nothing.

17:47.486 --> 17:50.683
I was just telling Hilda how
we ran into Claire Meade yesterday,

17:50.756 --> 17:52.748
and the two of you had a lovely chat.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.452
Yes. She's an amazing woman.

17:54.527 --> 17:59.055
Yeah, sure, if you can get past
the booze and the pills and the murder.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.498
Why a biography has not been written
about that woman. It's criminal.

18:02.535 --> 18:03.934
I'd buy it.

18:04.570 --> 18:07.802
And she told me
you two were worried about me,

18:07.841 --> 18:12.301
but I want you to know
that everything is fine.

18:12.346 --> 18:14.541
In fact, better than fine.

18:15.649 --> 18:16.877
My goodness! I'm gonna be late!

18:16.917 --> 18:19.750
<i>Papi, I am so glad that
everything is okay, but I have to run.</i>

18:19.787 --> 18:22.951
I'm interviewing some of Claire Meade's
friends for her tribute video.

18:23.024 --> 18:25.618
And they were really eager to talk,
so I think it's gonna be great.

18:29.631 --> 18:32.429
So, what is Claire's best quality?

18:33.301 --> 18:36.533
Wouldn't it be better
if you turned the camera on?

18:36.605 --> 18:38.004
Oh.

18:38.841 --> 18:43.471
Red button, red button. Okay.
What's Claire's best quality?

18:43.779 --> 18:46.839
Claire's best quality. Hmm.

18:46.882 --> 18:50.215
Well, she's a fun drunk.

18:50.653 --> 18:51.916
She's a fun drunk.

18:51.955 --> 18:54.981
Well, for the first five drinks, that is.

18:55.058 --> 18:57.788
The next five,
it's all tears and obscenities.

18:57.861 --> 19:00.728
But if you can hang in there
till the seventh drink...

19:00.764 --> 19:02.254
Till number 11...

19:02.332 --> 19:04.061
...well, it gets to be fun again.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.569
...she's a stumbling delight.

19:06.871 --> 19:10.034
Tell me something that
you admire about Claire.

19:10.741 --> 19:12.208
Well...

19:12.243 --> 19:13.938
- That's a tough one.
- Well...

19:14.912 --> 19:21.147
How surprisingly well she managed
to rebound from that murder conviction.

19:22.154 --> 19:26.284
Okay, what's the most fun
you've ever had with Claire Meade?

19:28.026 --> 19:29.288
Well...

19:30.696 --> 19:33.460
Claire wasn't actually there.

19:35.234 --> 19:36.930
It was when she was on the lam.

19:36.970 --> 19:40.133
See, Viveca and I
were leaving Le Bernadin,

19:40.173 --> 19:45.702
and we saw a woman
who looked exactly like Claire

19:46.613 --> 19:49.207
eating out of a garbage can.

19:50.383 --> 19:55.287
We laughed! It was priceless.

19:56.156 --> 19:57.919
Honey, are we done?

19:59.460 --> 20:00.484
Thank you.

20:01.095 --> 20:03.655
Hey, Betty.
How's the Claire Witch Project going?

20:04.098 --> 20:07.466
Those women were horrible!
Claire Meade has no friends.

20:07.502 --> 20:10.232
This tribute video's
gonna be really sad.

20:10.272 --> 20:14.140
Here, shoot me.
I'll give Claire a little birthday greeting.

20:14.643 --> 20:15.701
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:15.911 --> 20:17.640
And action.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.810
Happy birthday, Mrs. Meade.

20:21.383 --> 20:23.215
You killed my mother!

20:23.920 --> 20:25.012
Not helping.

20:25.321 --> 20:26.948
Pretty Molly!

20:28.991 --> 20:30.652
You sound like an idiot.

20:30.693 --> 20:33.662
See, Marc? This is what happens
when you put yourself out there.

20:33.696 --> 20:35.926
Well, you could have
watered his plants.

20:35.998 --> 20:38.024
You didn't have to offer to bird-sit.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.661
Well, I guess people in love
do stupid things.

20:43.006 --> 20:45.270
Did you just say the "L" word?

20:45.542 --> 20:49.740
Oh, Willie! Have you told Connor yet?

20:49.780 --> 20:52.545
Has that bird crap rotted your brain?
Of course not.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.609
Well, why not, if it's how you feel?

20:54.652 --> 20:58.486
Have I taught you nothing about power?
I can't say it first.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.218
It's like when you call Bill Clinton.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.488
You put him on hold,
and then you get me on the line.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.290
I don't think it's the same thing.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.592
Until he makes the first move,

21:06.631 --> 21:11.695
no one outside this office
will ever hear me say, "I love Connor. "

21:11.770 --> 21:13.260
I love Connor.

21:16.175 --> 21:19.235
- Did that just say...
I love Connor!

21:19.278 --> 21:20.768
I didn't hear anything.

21:20.813 --> 21:24.079
I love Connor! I love Connor!

21:28.788 --> 21:29.812
Ta-da!

21:29.856 --> 21:31.915
New York's best-kept secret.

21:31.958 --> 21:36.952
I know how much you like Tibetan food,
so the pride of Little Tibet!

21:37.698 --> 21:39.290
You remembered.

21:40.334 --> 21:42.564
That is so sweet. Thank you.

21:44.438 --> 21:48.135
- Surprised?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

21:49.210 --> 21:51.110
But there's something you should know.

21:51.145 --> 21:54.980
- Miss Molly! Welcome back!
- Hi, Sam.

21:55.717 --> 21:57.878
I've kind of been here before.

21:57.919 --> 22:01.150
- You're not Mr. Connor.
- No, I'm not.

22:02.090 --> 22:03.990
Where's Mr. Connor?

22:04.026 --> 22:06.620
We don't know
where Mr. Connor is, Sam.

22:06.662 --> 22:09.427
But you have me, Mr. Daniel.

22:09.465 --> 22:13.765
- Mr. Connor's not sick, is he?
- No! I don't know. Look, it doesn't...

22:14.570 --> 22:17.038
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap.

22:17.106 --> 22:18.767
Would you show us
to our table, please?

22:18.841 --> 22:20.240
Absolutely.

22:35.893 --> 22:37.121
Daniel.

22:39.130 --> 22:41.598
These women are supposed
to be Claire Meade's friends,

22:41.633 --> 22:44.864
but they're like vultures.
Fur-wearing vultures.

22:46.037 --> 22:48.562
- Can we see the tape?
- No.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.403
<i>Papi, dinner!</i>

22:51.443 --> 22:53.139
Now I don't know what I'm gonna do.

22:53.212 --> 22:56.272
I mean, I guess I could always
interview Mrs. Meade.

22:56.348 --> 22:59.715
So she'll be doing a tribute video
to herself?

22:59.785 --> 23:02.982
Don't stress me out.
I don't know what else I can do.

23:03.022 --> 23:05.616
Isn't there, like, home videos
you could use or something?

23:05.658 --> 23:07.889
Oh, you should see the home videos.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.988
I saw Claire Meade
fall into a Christmas tree.

23:11.031 --> 23:14.728
And apparently, there's a Fourth of July
barbeque-in-the-pool spectacular.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.430
Yeah, remember that Fourth of July
when we got the inflatable pool?

23:17.471 --> 23:18.904
<i>Papi couldn't get the chemicals right.</i>

23:20.006 --> 23:23.636
<i>And mami's hair turned green!
She was so mad at papi.</i>

23:23.845 --> 23:25.938
I know,
I remember that green hair!

23:26.013 --> 23:28.846
I think that is why
I became a beautician.

23:29.550 --> 23:31.074
<i>Papi, dinner!</i>

23:32.120 --> 23:34.748
He's still upstairs with Elena
doing his physical therapy.

23:34.789 --> 23:37.884
Elena's still here? I thought
she would have been gone hours ago.

23:37.926 --> 23:42.158
<i>No, papi asked her to stay for dinner.
So, can you go get them?</i>

23:42.197 --> 23:43.562
Thank you.

23:56.379 --> 23:57.641
Oh, my God.

23:57.714 --> 23:58.806
Betty!

24:06.456 --> 24:08.152
Are you two...

24:09.527 --> 24:10.824
Together.

24:12.863 --> 24:13.887
Hmm...

24:15.900 --> 24:17.663
<i>Mis hijas,
I knew this would be awkward,</i>

24:17.701 --> 24:19.862
that's why I was keeping it a secret.

24:19.904 --> 24:25.241
But after talking to Mrs. Meade,
I realized that I had a good thing here.

24:25.277 --> 24:27.609
I needed to come clean about it.

24:27.646 --> 24:29.580
Elena and I were gonna
tell you after dinner.

24:29.614 --> 24:33.744
Wait, so Mrs. Meade said
that this was a good idea?

24:33.819 --> 24:36.652
Yes. She's a very smart woman.

24:36.688 --> 24:40.819
Hey, I asked you if there was something
weird going on with my father,

24:40.860 --> 24:42.384
and you lied to my face.

24:42.428 --> 24:43.656
- Hilda...
- That's not her fault.

24:43.696 --> 24:45.527
I asked her not to say anything.

24:45.565 --> 24:49.399
<i>Papi, come on.
This is crazy. She's your nurse.</i>

24:49.435 --> 24:51.903
You're recovering
from open-heart surgery.

24:51.938 --> 24:53.702
You're not in a place to think clearly.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.105
And you!

24:55.142 --> 24:59.545
You came into our house to take care
of our sick father. He's your patient!

24:59.646 --> 25:01.637
- Okay, Hilda, just listen to me.
- No, no, no!

25:01.682 --> 25:03.980
This is so inappropriate.
What is wrong with you?

25:04.017 --> 25:05.416
That's enough.

25:05.452 --> 25:07.784
- Okay, maybe I should leave.
- No, no, no.

25:07.821 --> 25:10.757
- No, it would be better if you left.
- That is not up to you!

25:10.792 --> 25:13.556
Hey, yeah, it is! We are the only ones
making sense here!

25:13.595 --> 25:14.721
<i>Y qué sabes tú de "making sense"?</i>

25:14.762 --> 25:17.287
<i>Papi, please! You should calm down.</i>

25:17.932 --> 25:20.457
I'm sorry, I can't do this. I can't do this.

25:20.501 --> 25:22.435
- Elena.
- No, please!

25:32.248 --> 25:35.308
Dad, please, don't be angry with us.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.256
Listen to me.

25:40.290 --> 25:45.318
I know I haven't dated since your mom.
I know it can't be easy for you.

25:45.362 --> 25:50.026
But there is no way
Elena would ever replace your...

25:50.066 --> 25:51.192
Stop.

25:52.168 --> 25:55.104
Don't say her name
in the same sentence as Mom.

25:55.139 --> 25:59.166
- Betty.
- No! You can't date Elena!

25:59.277 --> 26:02.337
You know what? This isn't about me.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.577
It's about you two.

26:12.824 --> 26:15.850
Compliments of the chef.
- Yum! Thank you.

26:16.828 --> 26:19.956
Let me guess, a Mr. Connor favorite?

26:19.998 --> 26:23.229
Actually, it's for me.
I'm into the weirder stuff.

26:23.937 --> 26:25.928
Connor stuck to the noodles.

26:25.972 --> 26:27.530
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:28.341 --> 26:32.903
Well, Connor can keep his noodles.
'Cause I am all about the adventure.

26:38.919 --> 26:40.181
Huh.

26:40.220 --> 26:44.850
So, what is this?

26:44.925 --> 26:47.519
It's blood sausage.

26:50.097 --> 26:53.294
You sure can taste the blood.

26:54.502 --> 26:55.730
Uh-huh.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.035
Are you ready to order?

27:01.076 --> 27:03.135
I'm still deciding. You go.

27:03.178 --> 27:06.614
You know what? How about the...
I'll get this.

27:07.482 --> 27:09.417
One broiled yak tongue.

27:09.452 --> 27:10.510
Uh...

27:10.553 --> 27:16.048
You know what?
Actually, I'll just get the Number 46.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.786
Don't tell me what it is, though.

27:17.860 --> 27:22.297
Yes. Bean-thread noodles,
Mr. Connor's special.

27:27.004 --> 27:30.098
Could you please give us
another minute or two?

27:34.911 --> 27:39.041
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine, yep.

27:40.251 --> 27:42.845
It's just, it's Connor, you know?

27:44.222 --> 27:46.588
It just makes me feel...

27:47.258 --> 27:50.022
- Makes you feel what?
- Just...

27:53.131 --> 27:54.656
Sort of weird.

27:56.235 --> 28:00.729
- What are we drinking?
- Fermented yak butter tea.

28:00.773 --> 28:03.139
Tibetan delicacy. Why?

28:04.043 --> 28:05.704
Oh, Daniel, Daniel!

28:15.955 --> 28:18.981
I can't believe your class
would be interested

28:19.025 --> 28:21.585
in a day in the life of Claire Meade.

28:21.661 --> 28:26.065
Well, why not? You are
a big part of Meade Publications.

28:26.100 --> 28:30.469
<i>So, tell me,
how are things at Hot Flash?</i>

28:30.604 --> 28:31.662
Hmm. Oh.

28:31.705 --> 28:35.368
- I'm starting an advice column.
- Advice. Hmm.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.969
- How interesting.
I hope so.

28:38.012 --> 28:43.451
I'm thinking about calling it
"Claire Cares" or "I Claire About You. "

28:45.387 --> 28:46.820
I'm sorry.

28:47.989 --> 28:50.685
I have something I have to ask you.

28:51.626 --> 28:55.495
Did you tell my father
it was okay to sleep with his nurse?

28:56.365 --> 28:58.128
- Betty.
- I thought you were gonna talk

28:58.201 --> 28:59.691
some sense into him.

28:59.769 --> 29:04.468
I'm just a little surprised
that you encouraged him to get busy.

29:04.507 --> 29:08.910
He found someone he likes.
I told him to follow his heart.

29:08.945 --> 29:13.815
But she is way too young for him.
And he just had heart surgery.

29:13.851 --> 29:16.581
He's not ready for something like this.

29:16.620 --> 29:19.555
He's not ready or you're not ready?

29:22.493 --> 29:25.395
Mrs. Meade.
Did you just take something?

29:25.430 --> 29:29.093
- Maybe. So what?
- What? "So what?" That's stealing.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.692
Keep your voice down, Betty,
and keep moving.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.361
- Well...
- Let's be done for the day.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.566
I think I saw a gyro cart
on the corner, my treat.

29:37.742 --> 29:38.936
Mrs. Meade, give it to me!

29:38.977 --> 29:41.811
- Where are you going with that?
- What...

29:42.515 --> 29:45.484
Oh, I was just going outside, I...

29:45.518 --> 29:48.282
That's what you think.
Let's go. Come on.

29:52.892 --> 29:57.626
You've got a lot of nerve
or a lot of confidence, lady.

29:57.664 --> 30:01.430
Look, I did not do this.

30:01.501 --> 30:04.368
I'm not trying to implicate anyone else.

30:04.404 --> 30:09.671
I'm just saying I have never, ever
stolen anything in my entire life.

30:10.945 --> 30:12.503
- Betty.
- Mrs. Meade.

30:12.547 --> 30:16.347
I am so sorry. This young woman
didn't steal anything.

30:16.384 --> 30:18.545
I did. She tried to stop me.

30:18.586 --> 30:21.885
You know what?
I think I'll let the cops sort this out.

30:21.923 --> 30:23.220
The cops?

30:26.495 --> 30:29.362
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

30:30.432 --> 30:32.866
What are you gonna do
if the press finds out?

30:32.901 --> 30:36.769
Oh, please, Betty.
Nobody pays any attention to me.

30:36.838 --> 30:38.465
That is not true.

30:39.474 --> 30:42.069
Getting older is very strange, Betty.

30:44.247 --> 30:48.707
You marry, you have children,
everybody depends on you,

30:48.751 --> 30:52.710
and then one day you wake up
and you're invisible.

30:54.090 --> 30:56.992
You are not invisible.
You have your family.

30:57.027 --> 30:58.858
Well, Bradford's gone.

30:59.797 --> 31:04.564
Alexis and DJ are in France.
Daniel has Molly. I'm alone.

31:07.638 --> 31:09.435
Today's my birthday.

31:10.241 --> 31:14.269
Which you are aware of,
since this little video presentation

31:14.346 --> 31:18.612
is obviously part of the surprise party
that Daniel is having for me.

31:19.384 --> 31:21.045
You knew?

31:21.086 --> 31:24.783
Betty, you are so good
at so many things.

31:24.823 --> 31:26.951
Subtlety isn't one of them.

31:29.495 --> 31:33.261
Daniel just really wanted to do
something special for you.

31:33.299 --> 31:35.563
You know what I wish he'd do?

31:36.102 --> 31:40.471
I wish he would give me just a little time
alone with him.

31:42.442 --> 31:45.512
Be careful with your father, Betty.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.606
You and your sister
aren't going to live with him forever.

31:48.682 --> 31:53.312
And if he can find someone
to share his later years with,

31:53.353 --> 31:57.290
it won't hurt quite so much
when you can't meet him for dinner.

32:01.029 --> 32:04.487
We checked the security tape.
You're free to go.

32:05.233 --> 32:06.996
- Okay.
You're not.

32:07.568 --> 32:10.196
Mrs. Meade, you need to come with me.

32:10.238 --> 32:11.831
What?

32:11.874 --> 32:15.139
It's okay, Betty. I'll be fine.

32:27.724 --> 32:28.782
Hi.

32:30.226 --> 32:31.989
How're you feeling?

32:33.063 --> 32:35.122
God, those better not be leftovers.

32:35.165 --> 32:38.566
Yak tongue always tastes good
the next day. It's like pizza.

32:38.601 --> 32:43.005
No, I brought you some supplies.
Club soda, medicine.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.703
I'm so sorry about last night.
Worst date ever.

32:46.744 --> 32:47.904
No.

32:47.945 --> 32:49.913
I threw up on a Buddha statue.

32:49.947 --> 32:51.915
So you'll come back as a rat.

32:51.949 --> 32:53.814
I really wanted it to be special,

32:53.851 --> 32:57.686
you know, something
we could remember as our night.

32:57.723 --> 33:00.191
You and Connor have
so much history together...

33:00.292 --> 33:03.557
Daniel, you and I will have
our own history.

33:08.767 --> 33:12.795
I've never had a relationship
that's lasted more than six months.

33:13.773 --> 33:15.297
I'm afraid of screwing this up.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.673
Well, I won't let you.

33:17.710 --> 33:21.305
And for the record,
last night may not have been perfect,

33:21.381 --> 33:23.212
but it was memorable.

33:27.287 --> 33:28.652
I'm sorry.

33:30.891 --> 33:33.985
Betty. Yeah, what's going on?

33:42.637 --> 33:44.104
Hi, Mom.

33:44.139 --> 33:45.766
Oh, God, Daniel.

33:47.409 --> 33:49.536
I was expecting the police.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.409
Yeah, Betty called.

33:54.716 --> 33:59.086
I had our lawyer smooth things over, so,
you're free to go.

34:03.592 --> 34:08.029
I've been a bit of a mess. I'm sorry.

34:09.364 --> 34:10.889
No, I'm sorry.

34:15.071 --> 34:17.835
I haven't been a very good son recently.

34:24.681 --> 34:28.243
I guess we should get going.
I don't want to be late for my party.

34:30.420 --> 34:31.888
You know about that.

34:31.956 --> 34:33.786
I was almost relieved
to spend the night in jail

34:33.824 --> 34:37.056
rather than with those piranhas
I call my friends.

34:37.094 --> 34:41.554
But what the hell, I'll make the best of it.

34:43.302 --> 34:45.099
I love Prada!

34:45.137 --> 34:46.603
I love Connor!

34:46.638 --> 34:48.299
I love Gucci!

34:49.708 --> 34:52.574
I love Oscar de la Renta Fall 2009!

34:52.643 --> 34:55.373
Keep it simple, Mary!

34:56.716 --> 34:59.412
Forget it. Just throw it out the window.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.278
I love Connor!

35:01.321 --> 35:04.051
But that's bird-er.

35:04.691 --> 35:06.488
The little monster has wings.

35:06.526 --> 35:10.428
Let it fly south and torment
some poor family in Staten Island.

35:10.463 --> 35:13.331
You'd throw your boyfriend's
beloved pet out the window

35:13.367 --> 35:14.834
so he doesn't find out you love him?

35:14.869 --> 35:15.961
Yes!

35:20.407 --> 35:23.638
- May I say something? Friend to friend?
- No.

35:23.677 --> 35:25.508
- Man to woman?
- Oh, God, no.

35:25.546 --> 35:28.311
- Employee to employer?
- What is it, Marc?

35:29.518 --> 35:32.646
Waiting for someone else
to say "I love you" first

35:32.687 --> 35:35.155
doesn't mean you're more powerful.

35:36.691 --> 35:38.784
It just means you're afraid.

35:57.147 --> 35:58.205
Hi.

35:59.349 --> 36:04.844
Sorry, I hope you don't mind, I...
I just needed to talk to you.

36:06.023 --> 36:09.083
Something you forgot
to accuse me of last night?

36:09.159 --> 36:11.593
No, I just want to say I'm sorry.

36:13.264 --> 36:18.133
Look, this thing with you and my father,
it just took us by surprise.

36:20.672 --> 36:21.934
Me, too.

36:26.477 --> 36:29.003
Ten years I've been a nurse.

36:29.048 --> 36:33.417
Not once in my life have I ever felt
this way about one of my patients.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.420
And now Hilda thinks
I'm some kind of predator.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.081
No, she doesn't.

36:39.124 --> 36:43.459
Maybe a little. Well, we're just
worried about our father.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.895
And his heart.

36:44.931 --> 36:47.627
Romance is good for your heart.

36:47.701 --> 36:49.669
What do you think, we were swinging
from the chandeliers?

36:49.736 --> 36:52.967
No! God, no! Well, I wasn't.

36:56.242 --> 36:59.804
Betty, I wasn't looking
for this to happen. Believe me.

37:01.515 --> 37:04.109
But your father's a good man.

37:04.151 --> 37:08.110
He's kind, smart, a great cook...

37:11.258 --> 37:13.727
And he's good for my heart, too.

37:35.652 --> 37:37.813
We're gonna be five tonight.

37:54.838 --> 37:56.567
Why did you do this?

37:56.607 --> 37:59.577
Hilda, it might not feel good,

37:59.577 --> 38:02.137
<i>but we don't have the right
to stop papi from being with Elena.</i>

38:02.180 --> 38:05.081
Yes, we do. Because it's wrong.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.984
Or maybe it's just hard for us
to see him with another woman.

38:13.526 --> 38:16.290
<i>Hilda, mami's gone.</i>

38:17.196 --> 38:21.155
<i>That doesn't mean that papi has
to spend the rest of his life alone.</i>

38:21.200 --> 38:25.159
I know, I don't... I don't want that, either.
It's just...

38:26.439 --> 38:28.408
<i>It's hard enough
to keep mami's memory alive.</i>

38:28.475 --> 38:32.809
And I feel like she's disappearing.
It's just...

38:33.714 --> 38:34.942
I know.

38:40.887 --> 38:45.723
Look, no matter
what happens with Elena,

38:45.760 --> 38:48.024
your mom will never disappear.

38:51.165 --> 38:53.793
<i>Papi, I'm sorry.</i>

38:55.036 --> 38:59.074
This was more about us
than it was about you.

38:59.074 --> 39:03.010
<i>It's okay, mi hija.
I know it's complicated.</i>

39:03.045 --> 39:06.811
Guess what?
Elena knows Kiefer Sutherland!

39:06.849 --> 39:10.512
I don't know him,
I gave him a B-12 shot once.

39:10.552 --> 39:12.349
He cried like a girl.

39:12.387 --> 39:15.357
This is going straight
to the message boards.

39:16.126 --> 39:18.424
Anonymously, of course.

39:18.461 --> 39:21.225
Well, I guess I'll get another plate.

39:21.264 --> 39:24.529
- Can I help with anything?
- No, I got it.

39:32.777 --> 39:37.009
Don't worry. She'll come around.
Come on.

39:40.484 --> 39:41.849
How was London?

39:41.886 --> 39:44.651
- I closed the deal.
- Of course, you did.

39:48.326 --> 39:51.386
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

39:51.429 --> 39:55.126
- How's Olivia Newton-Bird?
- Sleeping.

39:55.167 --> 39:57.931
I hope she didn't drive you too crazy.

39:57.969 --> 39:59.801
Connor, I love you.

40:02.675 --> 40:07.237
I don't know what you feel,
but I needed to tell you...

40:13.620 --> 40:15.247
I love you, too.

40:19.326 --> 40:20.850
I love Connor!

40:24.998 --> 40:26.522
I love Connor!

40:27.067 --> 40:31.061
Daniel, if we do this, we are going
to be late for my surprise party.

40:31.105 --> 40:35.405
I just have to pick something up
in my office. It won't take a minute.

40:40.515 --> 40:41.948
What's this?

40:43.151 --> 40:44.449
Surprise.

40:46.689 --> 40:51.023
It might be nicer if you and I just
had a little dinner together.

40:51.060 --> 40:52.254
Alone.

40:54.296 --> 40:56.093
Happy birthday, Mom.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.023
Oh.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.605
Thank you.

41:06.209 --> 41:07.506
Shall we?

41:20.424 --> 41:24.690
<i>From behind these walls
I hear your song</i>

41:26.097 --> 41:29.829
<i>" And Bob served it out
with beaming looks,</i>

41:29.868 --> 41:33.929
<i>"while the chestnuts on the fire
sputtered and crackled noisily.</i>

41:33.972 --> 41:39.342
<i>"Then Bob proposed,
'A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. '</i>

41:39.378 --> 41:43.712
<i>"'God bless us, every one! '
said Tiny Tim,</i>

41:45.385 --> 41:47.250
<i>"the last of all. "</i>

41:48.354 --> 41:52.290
<i>I let you navigate on demand</i>

41:52.625 --> 41:56.652
<i>Just as long as you know</i>

41:56.896 --> 41:58.989
<i>This land is mine</i>

42:01.035 --> 42:05.096
<i>This land is mine but I'll let you rule</i>

42:05.272 --> 42:09.504
<i>I'll let you navigate and demand</i>

42:09.743 --> 42:13.304
<i>Just as long as you know</i>

42:13.781 --> 42:16.273
<i>This land is mine</i>

42:17.305 --> 42:23.415
