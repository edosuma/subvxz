01:16.420 --> 01:17.760
Come on, Max!

01:17.762 --> 01:19.461
- Almost there!
- Ugh!

01:19.463 --> 01:20.996
You said that 20 minutes ago.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.264
Whew!

01:24.068 --> 01:25.701
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25.703 --> 01:27.136
- Can I get, um...
- Hey.

01:27.138 --> 01:28.938
Ooh, can I get a hot chocolate?

01:28.940 --> 01:31.407
- Whipped cream on that?
- Yeah, go crazy.

01:31.409 --> 01:32.641
For you?

01:32.643 --> 01:34.310
Oh, I'll just have a water, please.

01:34.312 --> 01:35.609
Oh, come on.

01:35.611 --> 01:37.469
You really know how to make
a girl feel good about herself,

01:37.471 --> 01:38.411
you know that?

01:38.531 --> 01:40.030
What are you talking about?

01:40.032 --> 01:41.565
You're like Superwoman.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.833
Oh, stop.

01:42.835 --> 01:44.602
What? You're a kick-ass ex-cop,

01:44.604 --> 01:46.504
you've got a husband and two kids,

01:46.506 --> 01:49.540
you're great at your job, and
you run five miles <i> every</i> day.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.675
And you are brilliant and beautiful,

01:51.677 --> 01:54.478
and you have your whole life
ahead of you.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.747
You've got nothing
to feel bad about, Max.

01:56.749 --> 01:57.782
Thanks.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.316
Ever.

02:00.674 --> 02:01.913
Maxine?

02:02.509 --> 02:03.861
It is you.

02:04.728 --> 02:06.378
How long has it been?

02:06.380 --> 02:09.273
I don't know. Uh, six months?

02:10.550 --> 02:13.418
- Zara Hallam.
- Um... sorry.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.486
Zara, this is my, um...

02:15.989 --> 02:17.122
uh, my friend.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.615
- Reynolds Baker.
- Friend.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.003
Oh.

02:21.995 --> 02:24.329
Well, I'll let the two of you,
um, catch up.

02:24.331 --> 02:25.797
Thank you.

02:25.799 --> 02:26.965
Wow.

02:30.547 --> 02:32.671
Sorry about that, Dr. Baker.

02:32.673 --> 02:34.406
What are you doing in Montreal?

02:34.408 --> 02:36.098
Giving a lecture at McGill.

02:37.295 --> 02:38.844
What are <i> you</i> doing in Montreal?

02:39.215 --> 02:41.646
Oh, well, I, um...

02:41.648 --> 02:43.482
I-I live here now.

02:44.785 --> 02:47.252
Yeah, I got that job with Eric
Beaumont at Crisis Resolution.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.887
I know you think that's a bad idea.

02:48.889 --> 02:50.622
Not my place to judge, Maxine.

02:50.624 --> 02:52.457
Only to observe that this might be

02:52.459 --> 02:54.559
an unhealthy response
to your mother's death?

02:54.561 --> 02:56.495
It's going really good, though.

02:56.497 --> 02:58.263
Eric and his team are amazing.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.764
And

02:59.766 --> 03:02.167
I really feel like I'm helping people.

03:02.953 --> 03:05.337
Do you and Mr. Beaumont
ever talk about things?

03:05.339 --> 03:06.872
- Your drink.
- Uh...

03:06.874 --> 03:08.106
Yeah, not really.

03:08.108 --> 03:09.774
We're so busy all the time.

03:10.944 --> 03:13.879
You wanted answers, Maxine,
about your mother's death.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.114
I got some already.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.483
From who?

03:18.798 --> 03:20.151
You're not talking to Damien Delaine?

03:20.811 --> 03:23.522
S-Sorry to interrupt.
Art theft in Toronto.

03:23.524 --> 03:26.184
- Ransomer's asking $4 million by noon.
- Oh, okay.

03:26.186 --> 03:27.559
I got to run.

03:27.561 --> 03:29.222
It was good to see you.

03:40.107 --> 03:41.239
Nice place.

03:41.241 --> 03:43.508
But no time to enjoy it.

03:43.510 --> 03:45.777
"$4 million for the safe
return of the paintings.

03:45.779 --> 03:47.345
Turn this on 12:00 p.m."

03:47.347 --> 03:48.480
That gives us three hours.

03:48.482 --> 03:50.081
Well, why steal
a collection of paintings

03:50.083 --> 03:52.751
only to ransom them back to the owners?

03:52.753 --> 03:54.152
Fast buck?

03:54.154 --> 03:55.754
No faster than the black market.

03:55.756 --> 03:57.022
Unless they don't have

03:57.024 --> 03:59.291
the connections to fence the goods.

03:59.293 --> 04:01.860
Art thieves without a sell-on strategy?

04:01.862 --> 04:04.162
Well, maybe they're
first-timers, opportunists.

04:04.164 --> 04:06.731
Hard to believe first-timers
would know there was ransom insurance.

04:06.733 --> 04:08.033
Well, they might.

04:08.035 --> 04:10.470
How much did Nathalie
insure these paintings for?

04:10.472 --> 04:12.637
Their book value... $4 million.

04:15.349 --> 04:16.875
I'm... I'm sorry.

04:16.877 --> 04:18.176
Not... Not being funny,

04:18.178 --> 04:20.612
but $4 million for paintings like this?

04:20.613 --> 04:22.714
Didn't realize you
were a critic, Maxine.

04:22.716 --> 04:24.683
Well, you can share both your opinions

04:24.685 --> 04:25.984
with the art-gallery director.

04:27.187 --> 04:29.787
Oh, that'll be room service. My latte.

04:30.490 --> 04:32.574
Better make it quick.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.328
Oh, nice place.
How's their record for security?

04:36.330 --> 04:38.196
Spotless.

04:38.198 --> 04:39.664
They've got a Four-Tech system...

04:39.666 --> 04:42.500
motion sensoring, pressure
plinths, vibration tags,

04:42.502 --> 04:44.970
round-the-clock monitoring.

04:44.972 --> 04:47.439
If it's so good,

04:47.441 --> 04:49.341
how come private security didn't arrive

04:49.343 --> 04:51.643
until after the thieves had escaped?

04:51.645 --> 04:54.879
Because the thieves were fast?

04:55.416 --> 04:56.748
Good. You're here.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.516
- Hey.
- Hi. - Hi.

04:58.518 --> 05:01.319
Eric Beaumont, negotiator.

05:01.321 --> 05:03.688
Gwyneth Davenport, gallery director.

05:03.690 --> 05:06.424
We appreciate your discretion,
Mr. Beaumont.

05:06.426 --> 05:08.026
Of course. The stolen paintings

05:08.028 --> 05:10.629
were on loan from Isabelle Kalish.

05:10.631 --> 05:13.565
Our gallery has hosted collectors

05:13.567 --> 05:16.067
and their paintings for over 50 years.

05:16.069 --> 05:18.970
If word got out that
we were careless in some way...

05:18.972 --> 05:21.172
Just to clarify, Miss Davenport,

05:21.174 --> 05:24.439
the police have not been
notified about the theft?

05:24.982 --> 05:27.846
Well, Nathalie a-assured me
that you could negotiate

05:27.848 --> 05:29.614
the paintings' return
without the police.

05:29.616 --> 05:31.016
Uh, that's the plan, yeah.

05:31.018 --> 05:33.485
It would help to see
where the paintings were taken.

05:33.487 --> 05:34.786
Yes, of course.

05:34.788 --> 05:36.554
Please, this way.

05:36.556 --> 05:38.323
- I'll grab the equipment.
- Mm.

05:42.118 --> 05:44.362
You have something to tell me?

05:44.364 --> 05:45.764
What do you mean?

05:46.667 --> 05:48.533
Come on, Nathalie. I know my wife.

05:48.535 --> 05:51.136
- Ex-wife.
- Not yet you're not.

05:52.972 --> 05:54.673
Your people already briefed us.
What are you doing here?

05:55.303 --> 05:57.575
I pushed to insure these paintings...

05:58.253 --> 06:01.179
over my supervisor's objections.

06:01.181 --> 06:03.348
Now you're being held responsible?

06:03.806 --> 06:05.083
Personally.

06:05.530 --> 06:08.053
For a $4-million policy.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.056
So if I don't get these paintings back,

06:11.058 --> 06:12.691
you lose your job.

06:13.431 --> 06:14.759
No pressure.

06:16.697 --> 06:18.396
There's something else.

06:20.534 --> 06:22.133
Something else is wrong.

06:22.135 --> 06:24.969
No. Nothing else.

06:41.380 --> 06:49.442
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:50.829 --> 06:52.663
The exterior doors were undamaged.

06:52.665 --> 06:54.866
Th-This is the only sign
we even had a break-in.

06:54.868 --> 06:57.682
Maybe they hid somewhere
in the gallery after closing.

06:58.471 --> 07:00.905
The alarm was triggered
at 2:02 this morning?

07:00.907 --> 07:02.340
Yes, that's right.

07:02.950 --> 07:03.875
Yeah, and your security team

07:03.877 --> 07:06.210
responded in less than five minutes.

07:06.212 --> 07:08.045
Pretty fast, but not fast enough.

07:08.047 --> 07:10.515
Oh, uh, CCTV did catch a glimpse of...

07:10.517 --> 07:12.483
of one of the thieves out back.

07:12.485 --> 07:13.718
Can we see that footage?

07:13.720 --> 07:14.919
Yes, of course.

07:14.921 --> 07:16.787
Were these all here during the break-in?

07:16.789 --> 07:18.422
Yes.

07:18.424 --> 07:19.490
The only paintings

07:19.492 --> 07:21.425
that were stolen belonged to Ms. Kalish.

07:21.427 --> 07:23.895
Well, her collection
was nearest the door.

07:23.897 --> 07:25.930
I guess once they triggered the alarm,

07:25.932 --> 07:27.865
they took what they could and ran.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.634
Was anyone here last night?

07:29.636 --> 07:31.068
Just Jasper.

07:31.070 --> 07:32.637
Jasper?

07:32.639 --> 07:34.005
Oh, yes. He's always here.

07:36.249 --> 07:37.675
Jasper Edwards.

07:37.677 --> 07:39.810
He came to the gallery three years ago.

07:39.812 --> 07:42.346
He's the most brilliant restorer
I've ever come across.

07:42.348 --> 07:45.883
He has no family,
no life outside of this room.

07:45.885 --> 07:49.020
Except when he goes to the burrito stand

07:49.022 --> 07:50.788
two times a day.

07:50.790 --> 07:53.095
He puts his shoes on for that.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.926
Does he have autism?

07:54.928 --> 07:56.861
Well, he's on the spectrum.

07:56.863 --> 07:59.063
Mm. Painting makes sense.

07:59.065 --> 08:01.999
Obsessive, laser-sharp focus.

08:02.001 --> 08:05.536
Tendency to have high levels of
processing on certain patterns.

08:06.539 --> 08:08.773
Would you mind if I spoke to him?

08:08.775 --> 08:11.127
No, of course not. Just...

08:11.411 --> 08:12.944
be careful, though.

08:12.946 --> 08:15.012
He doesn't really like strangers.

08:17.442 --> 08:19.250
Okay, I understand.

08:19.252 --> 08:21.519
Well, please call me
as soon as you get the result.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.588
Thank you.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.323
Hey.

08:29.395 --> 08:31.138
Everything okay?

08:31.943 --> 08:33.543
My mother's sick.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.900
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.368
Is it serious?

08:37.370 --> 08:39.303
I'm sorry.
That was unprofessional of me.

08:39.304 --> 08:41.272
No. Nathalie, it's fine.

08:41.274 --> 08:43.371
We've known each other for a long time.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.409
Don't tell Eric, please.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.881
Okay. Can I ask why, though?

08:50.883 --> 08:53.417
I mean, I know he'd love
to help if he could.

08:53.419 --> 08:56.053
Just don't tell him, okay?

08:56.055 --> 08:57.855
Yeah.

08:57.857 --> 08:59.265
You got it.

09:24.217 --> 09:25.567
Are you the police?

09:26.152 --> 09:27.543
No.

09:28.721 --> 09:30.556
I don't like police.

09:31.941 --> 09:33.641
My name is Eric.

09:33.999 --> 09:35.993
My name's Jasper.

09:37.046 --> 09:39.297
I didn't see anyone
take the paintings, or hear.

09:39.299 --> 09:40.998
I had my headphones on.

09:44.359 --> 09:46.344
I like the music you're listening to.

09:47.995 --> 09:49.640
Mozart, isn't it?

09:52.358 --> 09:54.011
You're waiting for me to leave.

09:54.013 --> 09:55.576
Okay.

09:56.215 --> 09:57.948
I like to paint alone.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.794
You have a lot of tubes of this one.

10:12.776 --> 10:14.474
What color is this, Jasper?

10:14.476 --> 10:16.075
Is it ocher?

10:17.515 --> 10:19.270
Ocher light?

10:20.440 --> 10:21.906
Naples, maybe?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.308
I call it yellow.

10:25.251 --> 10:26.977
So it is.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.548
You've got some on your watch.

10:32.947 --> 10:34.579
Yes, I do.

10:35.021 --> 10:36.087
Uh-huh.

10:37.156 --> 10:38.422
Hm.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.378
The thread from the bit
that drilled through the lock...

10:47.380 --> 10:49.814
clockwise or counterclockwise?

10:50.290 --> 10:51.909
Clockwise?

10:52.752 --> 10:53.818
That's right.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.644
Drill bits rotate clockwise.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.025
So the shavings should have
landed on the outside.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.163
So this lock was drilled
from the inside.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.672
Yeah, looks that way.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.869
So how did they get in?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.701
And why did they have
to drill their way out?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.112
Is this her house?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.880
This is it.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.816
The stolen paintings have
been in Isabelle Kalish's family

11:25.818 --> 11:27.474
for three generations.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.389
She kept $4 million
worth of paintings in there?

11:31.391 --> 11:34.392
I read this used to be one of the
nicest neighborhoods in the city.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.560
And it's been their family home
for generations.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.330
But Ms. Kalish is in danger
of losing it.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.233
- Why?
- Well, apparently her teacher salary

11:42.235 --> 11:44.602
doesn't cover payments
on the refinance loans.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.437
I bet $4 million would.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.972
Button cam? Really?

11:48.710 --> 11:51.308
You don't suspect she stole
her own paintings, do you?

11:51.909 --> 11:53.778
I suspect everyone.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.517
This is Zara Hallam, intel.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.985
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.186
Oliver Yates, profiling.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.721
- Hi.
- And last but not least,

12:03.723 --> 12:06.257
- Maxine Carlson...
- Art expert.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.359
Isabelle Kalish.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.595
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate your coming, Mr. Beaumont.

12:11.597 --> 12:12.930
Oh, not at all.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.666
I, uh, gather you normally
hung the paintings here

12:15.668 --> 12:17.624
before you loaned them to the gallery.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.204
People think I'm crazy.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.673
But it... it just doesn't feel
like home without them.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.874
And have you ever

12:23.876 --> 12:25.342
loaned the paintings
out for exhibition before?

12:25.344 --> 12:28.546
No. First time. And now this happens.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.415
And why did you decide
to loan them out now?

12:31.417 --> 12:34.251
When the gallery
first approached me, I said no.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.619
But when I thought about it,

12:35.621 --> 12:38.322
I realized that I was betraying
my grandparents' memory.

12:38.721 --> 12:40.991
They were dedicated collectors.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.326
Betraying how?

12:42.328 --> 12:44.628
After the war, they discovered
that one of their paintings

12:44.630 --> 12:48.265
was stolen from a Jewish family
fleeing the Nazis.

12:48.751 --> 12:52.403
It turned out the painting was
a Rubens worth over $10 million.

12:52.795 --> 12:55.172
And my grandfather tracked down
the rightful owners

12:55.174 --> 12:56.140
and gave it back.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.908
So, if he could do that,

12:57.910 --> 12:59.410
I thought the least that I could do

12:59.412 --> 13:02.580
is share all this beauty
with the public.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.381
It'd be helpful to know
if anyone's ever tried

13:04.383 --> 13:06.817
to acquire your collection, Ms. Kalish.

13:06.819 --> 13:09.487
Well, Isabelle's had many
offers, but she'd never sell it.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.458
This is Sydney Graves, my fiancé.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.728
Yeah, I mean, $4 million
is a lot of money, Ms. Kalish.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.296
Oh, don't think I haven't told her that.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.066
What those paintings mean to me
is beyond value.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.306
I want to pass them on to my daughter.

13:24.704 --> 13:28.330
Like my grandparents and
my parents passed them on to me.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.775
Can you bring up the paintings
in Ms. Kalish's collection?

13:30.777 --> 13:32.576
Here you go.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.691
One minute to call.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.515
Looking for something?

13:37.517 --> 13:38.716
Mm-hmm.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.819
Eric Beaumont, Arnaud Castel.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.120
It's Arnold, please.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.153
Hi.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.525
Arnold's the one who valued
the collection at $4 million.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.993
Ah, you do value appraisals.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.662
Ah. Authenticity determination, as well.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.367
11:59. One minute early.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.868
Okay, everybody settle.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.250
This is Eric.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.408
<i>Who are you, Eric?</i>

14:04.410 --> 14:05.543
Oh, I'm a negotiator,

14:05.545 --> 14:07.478
and I would like to give you
what you want.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.612
How's that sound?

14:08.614 --> 14:10.314
<i>Do you have $4 million?</i>

14:10.316 --> 14:12.149
Well, $4 million's a lot.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.818
Even if the insurance company
were willing to pay,

14:13.820 --> 14:16.086
it would take time
to get that kind of cash.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.857
But I could give you $400,000.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.160
<i>That offer's not enough.</i>

14:23.745 --> 14:25.596
So you're saying you want
to sit on this for a week,

14:25.598 --> 14:27.598
maybe two, give the police time
to track you down?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.900
I think that you want as much money

14:29.902 --> 14:32.570
as you can get right away
so this is over.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.102
Am I right?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.821
<i>I need more.</i>

14:37.076 --> 14:39.076
I'd really like to help you with that.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.779
But I agree. $400,000 is not enough.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.582
Let me see if I can persuade
the insurance company.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.119
Up to $600,000 okay?

14:56.963 --> 14:59.296
I've twisted their arm
and got you another 50 grand.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.625
So that's $450,000.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.535
<i>We wanted $4 million.</i>

15:04.537 --> 15:06.971
But you're getting
$450,000 with no police.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.607
That's not bad for a day's work.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.112
<i>I'll forward payment instructions.</i>

15:19.114 --> 15:22.152
Well, you were quite right
about Mr. Beaumont.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.891
I'll arrange for the cash.
Thank you, Eric.

15:32.215 --> 15:34.019
That was easy.

15:35.258 --> 15:36.517
<i>Too</i> easy.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.402
Something's wrong.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.374
Okay, CCTV picked up a figure
leaving at 2:03 this morning.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.075
One minute after the alarm.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.944
So, someone opened the door

15:46.946 --> 15:48.712
for the intruder from the inside,

15:48.714 --> 15:50.347
drilled through the lock...

15:50.349 --> 15:53.150
Trying to make it look like a break-in.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.825
Yeah.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.890
Oh. Looks like
it's Jasper's burrito time.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.563
Help! Help! Hey!

16:06.565 --> 16:08.832
Wait!

16:10.036 --> 16:12.236
- Aah!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

16:19.578 --> 16:20.911
Are you all right?

16:20.913 --> 16:22.446
Yeah.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.448
I couldn't get a proper shot.

16:27.373 --> 16:29.474
That yellow look the same to you?

16:30.310 --> 16:32.025
Jasper's been kidnapped.

16:33.113 --> 16:34.612
Max got partials on the driver.

16:34.614 --> 16:36.548
I'll run facial recognition.

16:36.550 --> 16:38.550
Who would want Jasper, and why?

16:42.656 --> 16:44.689
Okay, here we go.

16:44.691 --> 16:46.591
Who would want to kidnap Jasper?

16:46.593 --> 16:48.760
Well, someone who needs his expertise.

16:49.372 --> 16:50.662
You think this is connected

16:50.664 --> 16:52.580
to Ms. Kalish's stolen paintings?

16:52.582 --> 16:54.816
Or it's an awfully big coincidence,

16:54.818 --> 16:56.840
and I hate coincidences.

16:57.220 --> 16:58.870
Can you check Jasper's room?

16:58.872 --> 17:00.271
What am I looking for?

17:00.273 --> 17:02.540
Well, for anything that shows us
how he's mixed up in this.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.842
Come with me.

17:10.981 --> 17:14.484
Mm. It's true what they say
about you, Jasper.

17:14.487 --> 17:17.675
The work you have done for us
is the best I have ever seen.

17:18.353 --> 17:21.220
Now we just need you to do
the rest of the job, hmm?

17:21.619 --> 17:23.347
The easy part.

17:24.421 --> 17:25.925
We don't have time for this.

17:25.926 --> 17:27.593
We don't have time for this.

17:27.595 --> 17:29.562
No touching! No touching! No touching!

17:29.564 --> 17:32.331
Mnh. Aah!

17:32.333 --> 17:34.400
I hear there's a genius brain in there.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.829
Be a shame to spill it.

17:36.831 --> 17:39.400
Hey. Scaring him doesn't help. Huh?

17:39.402 --> 17:41.641
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.509
Look, our buyers are not
gonna wait around for long.

17:43.511 --> 17:45.378
Yes. Yes, I know.

17:48.983 --> 17:50.416
Leave us, baby.

18:08.653 --> 18:10.586
It's just you and me now.

18:10.588 --> 18:14.424
Everything will be all right
if you start working.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.128
Hey. We need to move fast for Jasper.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.446
You got anything?

18:20.448 --> 18:23.766
Yeah, it's gonna take forever
to get an I.D. from these.

18:23.768 --> 18:25.435
What did Nathalie tell you?

18:26.572 --> 18:29.455
What did Nathalie tell me about what?

18:29.457 --> 18:31.190
Well, listen, you don't want
to betray her confidence.

18:31.192 --> 18:32.990
I get it. But she told you something.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.394
Was it... Was it about Evie?

18:37.165 --> 18:38.364
Mnh-mnh.

18:39.212 --> 18:41.268
Well, somebody's ill.

18:42.137 --> 18:43.769
Sister, her mother.

18:47.068 --> 18:48.534
I'm gonna go with sister.

18:51.813 --> 18:53.212
Mother.

18:56.484 --> 18:58.184
Thanks, Ollie.

19:07.586 --> 19:10.596
No laptop. No computer.

19:10.598 --> 19:12.832
But I found Jasper's phone.

19:13.472 --> 19:15.001
- No contacts.
- Mm.

19:15.003 --> 19:17.503
Yeah, people with autism
can be isolated,

19:17.505 --> 19:21.174
find it difficult
to form relationships, so...

19:22.358 --> 19:24.177
Boulder Creek.

19:25.446 --> 19:28.080
Oh, could be a school. Camp, maybe?

19:34.155 --> 19:36.989
"Boulder Creek
Special Education Program."

19:36.991 --> 19:38.558
Maybe he was close to someone there,

19:38.560 --> 19:41.633
like a teacher, mentor,
someone like that.

19:42.230 --> 19:44.797
Exactly like that.

19:44.799 --> 19:48.100
Sydney Graves, Isabelle Kalish's fiancé,

19:48.102 --> 19:50.586
was also Jasper's teacher.

19:51.209 --> 19:52.672
That's how Isabelle met him.

19:52.674 --> 19:55.908
They're both teachers. Okay.

19:55.910 --> 19:58.611
<i>Well, Isabelle's had many offers.</i>

19:58.613 --> 20:00.846
Isolating the audio profile

20:00.848 --> 20:04.183
of Sydney's voice from Eric's button cam

20:04.185 --> 20:08.387
alongside the disguised voice
from the phone call.

20:08.389 --> 20:10.223
<i>That offer's not enough.</i>

20:10.225 --> 20:12.725
Isolating the word "offer."

20:12.727 --> 20:15.861
<i>Offers.<i> Offer's.</i></i>

20:16.731 --> 20:20.366
Same intonation. Same tone.

20:20.368 --> 20:22.478
Exactly the same pitch.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.604
So that's a match?

20:25.673 --> 20:27.807
Sydney stole his fiancée's paintings.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.743
He persuaded Jasper to let
the thieves into the gallery.

20:30.745 --> 20:33.012
But why steal them when they're on loan?

20:33.014 --> 20:35.248
He could have taken them
from their home at any time.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.584
And why kidnap his own former student?

20:46.661 --> 20:49.662
$450,000. It's all there.

20:50.345 --> 20:51.931
Do we have the instructions
for the exchange?

20:52.720 --> 20:55.201
Yeah. Came in a few minutes ago.

20:55.203 --> 20:58.371
Downtown swanky hotel, room 2610,

20:58.373 --> 21:00.406
8:30 tomorrow morning. Why?

21:01.116 --> 21:02.749
Let's have that appraiser meet us there.

21:04.112 --> 21:05.444
You're going through with this?

21:05.446 --> 21:06.912
Nathalie insured those paintings.

21:06.914 --> 21:09.482
It's our job to get them back.

21:09.484 --> 21:11.350
Is everything okay?

21:12.082 --> 21:13.419
Of course.

21:58.445 --> 22:02.247
<i>Put the briefcase
on the bed and then open it.</i>

22:13.561 --> 22:17.295
<i>There's a safe in the wardrobe.
The code is 1961.</i>

22:27.327 --> 22:29.107
<i>The key is to the room
where the paintings are.</i>

22:29.109 --> 22:32.677
<i>When the money's in the safe,
I'll give you the room number.</i>

22:41.021 --> 22:42.754
This one's legit, too?

22:43.234 --> 22:45.156
"Improvisation" by Niko Korbinian.

22:45.158 --> 22:47.125
1933. No doubt.

22:48.229 --> 22:50.128
- And this is the last one.
- Ah.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.827
It's my favorite.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.427
"Formation in Yellow."

22:53.429 --> 22:55.967
Rrok, 1949.

23:02.811 --> 23:04.409
Listen, we can take it from here.

23:05.131 --> 23:07.011
Go be with your mother.

23:13.136 --> 23:14.986
You should've told me, Nathalie.

23:14.988 --> 23:16.654
This is my life, Eric.

23:17.208 --> 23:18.690
I'm just trying to make it
easier for you.

23:18.976 --> 23:20.892
I didn't ask you to.

23:21.507 --> 23:22.785
What's wrong with Irene?

23:23.379 --> 23:25.163
They think the cancer's back.

23:30.396 --> 23:31.669
Well...

23:32.133 --> 23:35.840
I can confirm the authenticity
of all nine canvases.

23:36.586 --> 23:38.086
These are the Kalish paintings.

23:38.111 --> 23:39.510
Thanks, Arnold.

23:41.495 --> 23:43.845
Fine. I'm going.

23:48.855 --> 23:50.855
You know how much I love you.

23:56.604 --> 23:59.675
See? Got what you wanted again.

24:02.559 --> 24:05.013
Thank you, Mr. Castel.
Really appreciate your help.

24:05.015 --> 24:07.182
Of course. And well done.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.617
All of you.

24:11.438 --> 24:13.222
What the hell is going on?

24:13.224 --> 24:16.225
You paid when you knew
Ms. Kalish's fiancé was involved.

24:16.227 --> 24:18.977
Oh, Mr. Castel is right.
These are the real paintings.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.629
All except for this one.

24:20.631 --> 24:22.247
They got Jasper to forge it.

24:22.249 --> 24:23.599
How'd you figure that out?

24:23.601 --> 24:26.602
From the half-dozen empty tubes
of yellow paint in his studio.

24:26.604 --> 24:28.770
So he fooled the appraiser.

24:29.811 --> 24:32.541
Either that, or Mr. Castel is in on this

24:32.543 --> 24:34.977
with Sydney Graves, Isabelle's fiancé.

24:34.979 --> 24:36.445
How are we gonna prove that?

24:37.157 --> 24:38.380
I'm not sure yet.

24:38.902 --> 24:41.884
But I am pretty sure that
Jasper's life depends on it.

24:43.187 --> 24:45.320
You stole my grandmother's paintings?

24:45.322 --> 24:46.955
It's not that simple.

24:46.957 --> 24:47.910
Please, would you just...
would you just...

24:47.935 --> 24:49.502
Oh, my God.

24:50.811 --> 24:54.580
For what it's worth, he's
telling the truth, Ms. Kalish.

24:54.582 --> 24:56.548
It isn't that simple.

24:56.550 --> 24:58.417
You see?

24:58.419 --> 25:00.969
He only intended to steal the paintings
from the gallery long enough

25:00.971 --> 25:02.971
to collect the insurance money.

25:03.422 --> 25:04.806
I did this for you.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.475
And for her.

25:06.949 --> 25:08.143
Why?

25:08.145 --> 25:10.500
Do you really need to ask?

25:10.502 --> 25:12.463
We can barely cover our expenses.

25:12.465 --> 25:16.084
And I know that you would
never sell those paintings.

25:16.086 --> 25:18.020
You betrayed me, Sydney.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.956
I can't believe you used Jasper
for this.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.856
Whose idea was it, Mr. Graves?

25:23.858 --> 25:25.957
Was it yours or Mr. Castel's?

25:27.648 --> 25:29.314
Mr. Castel's.

25:33.650 --> 25:36.981
So, he has the $450,000
that we left in that safe?

25:37.751 --> 25:39.576
He said that we would split it.

25:40.224 --> 25:44.279
Yeah. Mr. Castel has
double-crossed you, Mr. Graves.

25:44.639 --> 25:46.447
He used you to get to Jasper.

25:47.251 --> 25:49.618
You wish you were back home, I bet.

25:49.620 --> 25:52.254
I know how that feels.

25:52.256 --> 25:53.922
Sorry to interrupt.

25:53.924 --> 25:57.139
But if he don't get on with it,
we're gonna lose millions.

25:57.728 --> 25:59.394
Just a reminder.

26:01.799 --> 26:03.799
You know, Jasper,

26:04.125 --> 26:06.201
you can go back any time you want.

26:06.203 --> 26:07.235
Hm?

26:07.237 --> 26:10.305
All you've got to do is finish this.

26:15.846 --> 26:17.346
Call Mr. Castel.

26:17.348 --> 26:20.015
Not all the paintings were returned.

26:21.688 --> 26:23.552
"Formation in Yellow" is a forgery

26:23.554 --> 26:25.854
Jasper Edwards painted for Mr. Castel.

26:25.856 --> 26:28.323
And why would he get Jasper to do that?

26:30.728 --> 26:32.327
Jasper still won't work.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.762
And we're running out of time.

26:33.764 --> 26:35.430
If he doesn't work,
then we move on, then.

26:35.432 --> 26:37.899
Yeah, well, he won't listen to me.

26:38.791 --> 26:40.502
You got him to paint before, right?

26:40.504 --> 26:41.670
He's too scared.

26:41.672 --> 26:42.904
Okay, then this is over.

26:42.906 --> 26:45.207
- No, wait. Wait. Wait.
- Ohh! Oh!

26:45.209 --> 26:47.909
I know someone who can
talk him into anything.

26:50.681 --> 26:52.581
Well, then, call him.

26:57.071 --> 26:59.004
You know, I think...

26:59.006 --> 27:03.275
I think the value of my role
has been underrepresented.

27:06.046 --> 27:07.079
What?

27:07.081 --> 27:09.247
I delivered you the painting and Jasper,

27:09.249 --> 27:11.049
and now you still need my help.

27:11.051 --> 27:13.719
10% hardly seems fair, does it?

27:13.721 --> 27:15.387
How's 25%?

27:17.925 --> 27:20.859
Okay. 25% it is.

27:20.861 --> 27:22.361
Yeah.

27:29.853 --> 27:31.995
It's Arnold Castel.

27:32.423 --> 27:33.922
What do you want me to do?

27:33.924 --> 27:35.390
Take the call.

27:35.392 --> 27:38.510
Nothing's changed. Just talk to him.

27:41.932 --> 27:43.422
Yeah?

27:44.910 --> 27:46.255
What?

27:47.735 --> 27:50.489
Yes, I will... I can talk to him.

27:55.763 --> 27:57.145
Okay. Yeah.

27:57.147 --> 27:59.297
Yeah. All right. I'll see you there.

27:59.299 --> 28:00.766
Well done, Mr. Graves.

28:00.768 --> 28:03.802
Jasper's refusing to work.
He wants me to go persuade him.

28:03.804 --> 28:05.036
I don't understand.

28:05.038 --> 28:06.138
You're saying they still have

28:06.140 --> 28:08.073
the real "Formation in Yellow"?

28:08.075 --> 28:09.508
That's right. Yeah.

28:09.510 --> 28:11.193
So, Arnold must have made Jasper

28:11.195 --> 28:13.011
paint the copy that they returned.

28:13.509 --> 28:15.712
And now they want him to do what?

28:16.166 --> 28:17.966
Well, that's what we need to find out.

28:18.913 --> 28:20.101
"Formation in Yellow"

28:20.103 --> 28:22.671
is the least valuable piece
in the entire collection.

28:25.909 --> 28:28.043
Oliver and Zara.

28:29.379 --> 28:31.179
Facial recognition came through.

28:31.181 --> 28:34.157
They've identified
the woman driving the van.

28:34.718 --> 28:37.252
Drita Jakupi. Kosovan national.

28:37.254 --> 28:40.055
Specializes in
the illegal-artifact trade,

28:40.057 --> 28:43.658
specifically finding
Nazi-looted art to order.

28:43.660 --> 28:47.412
Nazi-looted art? I-I don't understand.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.983
I suspect the real "Formation in Yellow"

28:51.985 --> 28:54.319
isn't a part of your collection,
Ms. Kalish.

28:54.321 --> 28:55.720
It never was.

28:55.722 --> 28:57.756
It's a forgery.

28:58.876 --> 29:01.193
Hiding a much more valuable painting.

29:02.179 --> 29:04.166
The Rubens.

29:06.266 --> 29:09.201
And Arnold used me
to help steal it for him.

29:09.654 --> 29:13.438
And now they need Jasper
to remove the forgery

29:13.440 --> 29:15.740
and restore the old master underneath.

29:16.248 --> 29:19.628
My grandfather never returned it
to that Jewish family.

29:21.999 --> 29:23.782
He hid it...

29:24.401 --> 29:26.201
from all of us.

29:33.692 --> 29:34.876
Well?

29:35.762 --> 29:37.696
I, uh... I called him.

29:37.698 --> 29:39.464
Yeah. So is he coming?

29:40.727 --> 29:42.244
He is.

29:42.736 --> 29:43.902
No worries.

29:43.904 --> 29:45.654
Great.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.439
Then we don't need you anymore, do we?

29:48.842 --> 29:50.575
Aah!

30:05.604 --> 30:06.736
This is the place?

30:06.738 --> 30:07.904
Yeah, this is it.

30:07.906 --> 30:10.305
This is the address
where he said to meet him.

30:10.976 --> 30:14.032
So, all I have to do is get Jasper
to start restoring the Rubens?

30:14.679 --> 30:17.569
As long as he's useful
to his kidnappers, he's safe.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.657
What about me?

30:20.285 --> 30:22.185
You're the only person
who can get Jasper to work.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.087
- They need you, too.
- Okay, but wh...

30:24.089 --> 30:26.156
what about when he's done
with the paintings?

30:28.093 --> 30:30.026
Well, then, we get you out of there.

30:32.550 --> 30:35.318
Hey, t-t-that's
the van that took Jasper.

30:40.111 --> 30:41.458
Who's that?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.073
I recognize him.

30:44.075 --> 30:45.909
That's the man who kidnapped him.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.944
You've never seen that man
before, Mr. Graves?

30:47.946 --> 30:49.145
Never.

30:56.421 --> 30:57.832
- Change of plan.
- What?

30:57.834 --> 30:58.788
Give me your shirt.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.734
Whoa. What happened?

31:02.067 --> 31:04.567
Arnold's dead and that man killed him.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.271
<i>- Front desk.</i>
- It's Ms. Denard.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.661
Can you order a taxi
to the airport, please?

31:17.734 --> 31:19.066
<i>There's a car waiting.</i>

31:19.068 --> 31:21.635
<i>A Mr. Beaumont ordered it for you.</i>

31:23.673 --> 31:25.272
Th-Thank you.

31:28.878 --> 31:30.678
Okay, Sydney.

31:33.483 --> 31:34.949
Hurry up.

31:37.353 --> 31:40.488
Pardon me? Are you with Arnold?

31:40.490 --> 31:42.289
You Sydney?

31:42.738 --> 31:44.358
Give me your phone.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.662
Hands up. Hands up.

31:54.971 --> 31:56.270
Come with me.

31:56.272 --> 31:58.472
Get... Get... Get in!

31:58.474 --> 32:00.674
Okay, okay.

32:06.516 --> 32:08.749
I hope this works.

32:17.927 --> 32:19.478
Oh, my God.

32:22.365 --> 32:24.265
Arnie? Arnie?

32:24.267 --> 32:26.400
Arnold couldn't make him work.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.202
You understand what that means for you?

32:28.971 --> 32:32.006
Uh... yeah.

32:32.008 --> 32:33.107
Um...

32:33.109 --> 32:35.776
but I can see your problem.

32:36.232 --> 32:37.144
I mean, how can he be inspired

32:37.146 --> 32:39.079
with a dead body just lying here?

32:51.027 --> 32:52.960
Well, we can't...
we can't just leave him here.

32:52.962 --> 32:54.528
Someone will see.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.305
Maybe we could cover his body.

33:05.208 --> 33:06.373
You get back inside.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.243
Okay. Okay.

33:24.794 --> 33:25.860
It's Arnold.

33:26.393 --> 33:28.262
Mr. Beaumont said he was dead.

33:33.507 --> 33:35.448
<i> Where's Eugene?</i>

33:36.105 --> 33:37.944
<i>He's getting rid of the body.</i>

33:38.474 --> 33:40.210
Eric has his phone.

33:41.177 --> 33:42.910
Arnold is dead.

33:48.951 --> 33:50.377
Nathalie?

33:50.786 --> 33:53.387
Gwyneth. Is Eric here?

33:53.389 --> 33:55.756
No, he's trying to get Jasper back.

33:55.758 --> 33:57.124
Jasper?

33:57.126 --> 33:58.993
Jasper, my restorer.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.861
Mr. Beaumont didn't tell you?

34:00.863 --> 34:02.830
He's been kidnapped.

34:03.826 --> 34:05.533
You didn't know?

34:06.042 --> 34:07.968
Give me a second.

34:09.371 --> 34:12.540
Signal triangulates to this location.

34:19.282 --> 34:20.748
There's that van again.

34:26.556 --> 34:27.588
Hey, Nathalie.

34:27.590 --> 34:28.856
<i> Where are you?</i>

34:28.858 --> 34:30.391
<i>And don't you dare lie.</i>

34:30.393 --> 34:31.625
Yeah.

34:31.627 --> 34:33.016
Now get on with it.

34:58.087 --> 34:59.987
Hey, Jasper.

34:59.989 --> 35:01.355
Remember me?

35:05.528 --> 35:09.091
That other man is out back
covering up the body.

35:09.932 --> 35:11.565
<i>It's better without him here, isn't it?</i>

35:11.567 --> 35:14.234
He wants us to stop him
from going back inside.

35:14.236 --> 35:15.598
Oliver.

35:26.101 --> 35:29.216
Listen, I know you don't
like the police,

35:29.218 --> 35:30.618
but in a few hours, they're gonna come

35:30.620 --> 35:32.462
and take that man away.

35:33.055 --> 35:34.321
Okay.

35:34.323 --> 35:35.956
A few hours.

35:36.398 --> 35:40.094
There is a valuable painting
hidden in here.

35:41.263 --> 35:43.797
That's why they want you
to remove the forgery.

35:44.266 --> 35:45.699
What is it?

35:47.269 --> 35:49.903
He would like to know
what he's uncovering.

35:50.478 --> 35:52.006
A Rubens.

35:52.304 --> 35:53.407
What is that worth?

35:54.521 --> 35:56.744
I'll get $10 million for it.

35:59.949 --> 36:03.017
Wouldn't you like to see that, Jasper?

36:04.111 --> 36:05.185
Uh-huh.

36:05.187 --> 36:07.921
Could you show me how you work?
I'd really like to see that.

36:07.923 --> 36:09.369
Uh...

36:20.336 --> 36:21.869
Excuse me?

36:21.871 --> 36:22.936
Who the hell are you, mate?

36:22.938 --> 36:24.571
Ugh!

36:30.279 --> 36:32.980
You know, it's very modern of me
to let you do this.

36:33.443 --> 36:35.482
You mean I'm way faster than you.

36:36.213 --> 36:37.351
Basically.

36:38.176 --> 36:39.687
Help me turn him over.

36:56.572 --> 36:58.005
Where's Eric?

36:58.007 --> 36:59.540
He lied to me.

36:59.542 --> 37:00.808
Inside.

37:02.119 --> 37:03.391
With?

37:05.981 --> 37:08.382
A $10-million painting and...

37:08.384 --> 37:09.583
a gun to his head.

37:09.585 --> 37:11.185
And where are the police?

37:11.187 --> 37:12.586
He said to call them in a few hours.

37:12.944 --> 37:14.588
Okay. I'll call them now.

37:14.590 --> 37:16.253
Nathalie, please.

37:16.659 --> 37:18.325
He knows what he's doing.

37:18.327 --> 37:19.877
You know he does.

37:29.772 --> 37:32.106
He's taking a long time, isn't he?

37:32.108 --> 37:33.741
Your friend.

37:36.779 --> 37:38.645
Is it because you're from Kosovo?

37:38.647 --> 37:40.714
Is what because?

37:40.716 --> 37:42.983
Well, that you do this.

37:42.985 --> 37:46.186
Essentially profit from genocide.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.792
You know nothing about me or my country.

37:51.794 --> 37:54.962
Well, I know you left home
to escape a-atrocities of war.

37:54.964 --> 37:56.263
It's just that, you know,

37:56.265 --> 37:57.798
most people witness that kind of horror,

37:57.800 --> 38:00.234
they... they spend their lives
trying to get away from it.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.367
But you...

38:01.871 --> 38:04.037
you run right towards it.

38:06.375 --> 38:07.407
Eugene!

38:07.409 --> 38:09.422
He's not coming back.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.683
What is this?

38:21.190 --> 38:22.689
A choice.

38:22.691 --> 38:25.225
I'm not Sydney Graves.
My name is Eric Beaumont.

38:25.227 --> 38:27.661
I'm a negotiator.

38:27.981 --> 38:29.797
How many innocent people
do you think died

38:29.799 --> 38:33.100
to get that painting out of the
hands of its rightful owners?

38:33.888 --> 38:35.369
Don't move.

38:36.172 --> 38:38.751
- Don't! Don't! Please don't!
- Stop.

38:38.753 --> 38:41.508
Try leaving with that, you're
just like the people you fled.

38:41.510 --> 38:43.277
It's not the same. Sit down.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.301
Not finished. Not finished.

38:44.326 --> 38:45.296
You think all those people

38:45.321 --> 38:46.947
who died in your country would agree?

38:46.949 --> 38:48.549
Shut up!

38:48.551 --> 38:50.350
You know you won't get away with it.

38:51.539 --> 38:52.986
You know it.

38:52.988 --> 38:54.521
I'll destroy it.

38:54.523 --> 38:56.657
No, I don't think you will.

39:01.138 --> 39:04.264
If I see you again, you're dead.

39:10.239 --> 39:11.839
It's gonna be all right, Jasper.

39:25.554 --> 39:27.321
Okay. You're right over here.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.880
Can I go home now?

39:29.458 --> 39:32.025
Yeah, of course. We'll take you.

39:34.063 --> 39:36.697
We're gonna get
you home now, Jasper, okay?

39:36.699 --> 39:38.966
You told me this was over.

39:38.968 --> 39:41.101
I said we could handle it from here.

39:41.103 --> 39:44.371
It was my decision
to stay or go, not yours.

39:44.373 --> 39:46.607
You should be home
with your mother, Nathalie.

39:46.609 --> 39:48.342
The PET scan came back negative.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.843
My mother's fine.

39:49.868 --> 39:52.012
Okay. Thank God.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.250
You see? When something bad happens,

39:56.252 --> 39:58.548
I still want to be with you.

39:59.288 --> 40:01.388
But I can't do this anymore.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.385
I wanted to thank you all.

40:11.482 --> 40:13.449
And you, too, Jasper.

40:14.223 --> 40:15.569
I spoke with the police, Ms. Kalish.

40:15.571 --> 40:17.671
You're free to take your paintings home.

40:17.673 --> 40:20.641
I told Sydney I'm gonna
leave them with the gallery.

40:20.643 --> 40:22.109
All but one.

40:24.931 --> 40:28.081
Jasper, I wonder if I could
get your help with something.

40:32.331 --> 40:33.998
_

40:34.023 --> 40:37.391
You didn't have to come
all this way, Ms. Kalish.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.359
No, but I did.

40:39.361 --> 40:42.763
This was restored
with great care and love.

40:42.765 --> 40:44.898
And now it's where it belongs.

40:48.831 --> 40:50.231
Home.
