00:06.215 --> 00:08.300
-SANDY: Dear Mom,

00:08.342 --> 00:10.386
all is well and good here.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.054
Missing you like crazy,

00:12.096 --> 00:14.223
but learning new things
all the time.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.726
I came top of the class
in business studies this week,

00:16.767 --> 00:18.769
and my piano is improving.

00:18.811 --> 00:22.732
To be honest, I feel a little
like a caged bird now.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.776
I can't wait to go to college
and spread my wings.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.154
Things have
quietened down here.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.197
The new girl,
after a shaky start,

00:30.239 --> 00:33.367
has settled in well
and is making great progress.

00:33.409 --> 00:36.871
The online world is
a place of fiction and dreams.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.415
You will not be
the only young person

00:39.457 --> 00:41.500
whose digital presence
does not represent

00:41.542 --> 00:43.878
the entire truth
of their existence.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.963
SANDY:
It's so good to see someone

00:46.005 --> 00:49.383
who was so unhappy and angry
allow themselves

00:49.425 --> 00:52.928
to be a part
of what we're doing here.

00:50.342 --> 00:54.764
pay your due?

00:52.970 --> 00:54.472
Sometimes,
when she's caught off guard,

00:54.513 --> 00:56.599
I catch a sadness in her eyes.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.602
There's pain
deep down inside, I know it,

00:59.643 --> 01:03.022
and I pray for her every night.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.316
Maybe I understand Mia
better than anyone

01:05.357 --> 01:09.361
because she lost someone
like we lost our Jodie.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.448
bombs away...

01:12.490 --> 01:14.492
But she's beginning
to learn to trust us,

01:14.575 --> 01:16.160
and to realize there's no point

01:16.202 --> 01:18.454
fighting a fight
she can never win.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.166
Shit.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.709
MARISSA:
Vesuvius. 2468. Control.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.920
I'm back in town. I'll be
returning to the company.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.838
And I'd like
a full domestic clean.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.631
MANNION:
Mannion here.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.049
This is Vesuvius.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.759
I'm listening.

01:31.801 --> 01:34.053
I've been trying to sort out
a problem on my own,

01:32.718 --> 01:36.013
-Carmichael.
-John, we have a problem.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.721
but it didn't work.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.598
It concerns Utrax.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.058
There's a whistleblower

01:37.640 --> 01:38.891
But Utrax is long dead.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.392
No, it's not.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.644
trying to expose our operation.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.228
It's very much alive.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.646
We've intercepted an e-mail.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.481
Okay.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.690
He sent it last night
to a London journalist.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.775
I'll call you back.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.984
Looks like he's trying to tell
the world what we're doing.

01:47.358 --> 01:52.279
this Wednesday?

01:49.026 --> 01:50.611
Who is he?

01:50.653 --> 01:52.112
We don't know.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.196
MARISSA:
Hi.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.907
But we have to stop him
from talking.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.739
Where are you?

01:52.321 --> 01:57.159
he flew

01:53.781 --> 01:55.074
I'm in Northern France.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.116
Okay.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.408
Looking for Hanna.

01:56.158 --> 02:00.120
I can't use official channels
for this.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.786
So far, no sign.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.788
That's 'cause she's here.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.623
We caught her yesterday.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.165
It's time these girls did

02:02.665 --> 02:05.626
Where's here?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.209
what you trained them for.

02:05.668 --> 02:08.087
Where are you, John?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.856
HANNA:
"I cannot make you understand.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.525
"I cannot make anyone understand

02:29.567 --> 02:32.236
"what is happening inside me.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.445
WOMAN:
Ready?

02:32.278 --> 02:35.281
I cannot even explain it
myself."

02:33.487 --> 02:35.281
-Begin!
-

02:39.535 --> 02:41.161
GIRL:
She got her good.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.455
JESSIE:
It was definitely someone.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.289
McCOY:
Mia?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.708
Could you come with me, please?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.291
I saw a figure being taken
into the staff buildings.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.958
-

02:45.332 --> 02:46.584
HELEN:
Maybe it was, like,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.420
-Nice, Kelly!
-Yes, go, go, go! Come on!

02:46.625 --> 02:48.335
a foreign government agent.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.628
Or a spy or something.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.796
CARMICHAEL:
Hi, Mia.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.297
-That's it!
-Go, go, go!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.755
Don't be stupid, Helen.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.840
Take a seat, please.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.756
All right,
let's do this, come on!

02:51.797 --> 02:53.674
HELEN:
All I'm saying is we know
we're being kept apart

02:53.716 --> 02:56.135
for a reason, we're
in the middle of nowhere,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.429
surrounded by guards and what,
someone just breaks in?

02:56.468 --> 02:59.013
Thank you for coming,
both of you.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.931
WOMAN:
Ready position.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.098
As you'll recall,
a while ago I spoke to you

03:01.140 --> 03:05.144
about a period of service that
you would at sometime undergo.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.563
Well, we've reached that moment.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.982
We're sending you out
on your first engagement.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.234
Leo?

03:12.276 --> 03:14.695
There's a journalist in London.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.447
Her name is Nicola Gough.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.909
She's about
to obtain sensitive information

03:16.614 --> 03:18.198
That's $5.91.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.950
HELEN:
What are you reading?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.620
from an unknown U.S. source.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.952
-JULES: This.
-W-What is it?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.829
Just, like, the most
important book ever.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.372
The source goes
by the code name Tacitus.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.874
-What's it about?
-The death of youth.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.626
We need to know
Tacitus' true identity,

03:28.667 --> 03:32.046
and we need to stop Nicola Gough
from reaching him.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.670
-Doesn't matter.
-What do you read, Sandy?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.756
Oh, you know.
Mainly magazines, I guess.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.048
This'll tell you
everything you need to know.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.674
HELEN:
Oh, did you see this?

03:34.089 --> 03:35.341
Take a look at it.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.467
Learn it by heart.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.260
She's an actress.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.217
-Hi.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.302
CARMICHAEL:
How you doing?

03:38.302 --> 03:40.304
She looks amazing.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.595
Less than an hour away

03:38.469 --> 03:40.387
Questions?

03:39.637 --> 03:41.263
-from the pickup point.
-Good.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.306
God, I love her skin.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.640
One of my men'll be
there to meet you.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.849
Why us?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.183
-Oh, come on, Helen.
-What?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.058
He'll drive you
the rest of the way.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.769
Well, Mia has experience

03:44.099 --> 03:46.852
Why can't you just
give me the address?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.018
They're fake. Look at them all.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.145
Phony smiles, phony tans.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.813
in the world, experience
the rest of you can...

03:46.894 --> 03:49.063
You know why.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.147
You can talk about fake.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.023
You'll need to give him
your phone

03:49.855 --> 03:51.482
not yet rival.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.732
JULES:
Fuck that.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.275
and you'll be hooded for
the last part of the journey.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.442
And you, Jules...

03:51.774 --> 03:53.859
I'm way more real
than they'll ever be.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.611
How is she?

03:53.484 --> 03:56.195
you're a perfect match
for what we need...

03:55.653 --> 03:58.322
HELEN:
Well, I'm getting a coffee.

03:55.653 --> 03:59.073
She's still not talking.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.947
as you'll see.

03:58.364 --> 03:59.782
Anyone?

03:59.114 --> 04:01.700
Does she know I'm coming?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.492
Now, get ready.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.244
Keep it to yourselves
for now, please.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.452
Not yet.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.413
Okay, best keep it that way.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.996
Did you see that car earlier?

04:04.286 --> 04:05.913
Thank you.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.998
-What car?
-It came in this morning.

04:06.455 --> 04:10.960
oh, my, oh, yeah

04:08.040 --> 04:09.917
They're always coming in
with deliveries.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.920
This was no delivery.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.589
I think someone's back.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.714
oh, my, oh, my night

04:38.821 --> 04:41.365
he addicted me

04:43.492 --> 04:45.285
him

04:44.493 --> 04:46.870
-Welcome back.
-Thanks, Kim.

04:45.327 --> 04:49.081
he addicted me

04:49.123 --> 04:51.917
and he addicted me

04:51.959 --> 04:55.254
addicted me

04:52.459 --> 04:54.420
Everything okay?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.423
Yes. It was
a challenging mission.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.841
and I addicted him

04:57.297 --> 04:59.508
Like, it used to be pretty good,

04:57.464 --> 04:59.258
But it's done?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.219
Not quite,
but we're getting there.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.261
but I literally
just found a hair.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.263
oh, my night life

05:02.261 --> 05:05.222
Well, we had good cover
while you were gone.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.055
Oh, don't be scared.
I'm sure yours is fine.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.766
Maybe the person
serving in line

05:05.264 --> 05:06.974
Langley sent her.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.810
and, oh, our night life

05:07.016 --> 05:09.393
She has full authorization.
I assumed you knew.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.102
: just forgot to put on
her hairnet or something.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.437
Yes, of course.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.312
Oh, no, I'm sure it's fine.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.356
Maybe it's not fine.
Should we let someone know?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.026
Marissa Wiegler,
head of section.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.070
Sonia Richter.
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.120
Clara?

05:26.535 --> 05:28.537
-Thanks, Kim.
-Mm-hmm.

05:30.456 --> 05:31.415
-Boo!
-Oh!

05:33.667 --> 05:35.836
So, what's going on?

05:35.878 --> 05:38.672
You going with Jules?

05:35.919 --> 05:39.673
LEO:
Okay, so, the first thing
I want to do is lose the muscle.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.090
Yeah. To London.

05:39.715 --> 05:44.678
But I have to be sure you're not
gonna try to rip my head off.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.633
To do what?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.927
I can't say.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.344
Clemency.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.182
Are you gonna try
to rip my head off?

05:47.765 --> 05:50.768
It's her, isn't it?

05:48.098 --> 05:49.808
What's wrong?

05:50.225 --> 05:53.562
I'll take that as a no.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.312
Hanna.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.394
:
I don't know.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.896
It's just weird.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.315
It was her that broke in.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.689
I thought it would be
what you wanted.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.816
Guys, you can go. Wait outside.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.191
It is.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.317
JULES:
Hey, you guys, listen.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.236
It was your decision to stay.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.319
I need your help
with something.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.447
Just go.
We're gonna be fine here.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.237
I got to get to class.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.072
We could have...

06:02.279 --> 06:03.864
I'll see you later.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.158
-left and found your mother.
-My mother's dead.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.494
-Marissa...
-Marissa was lying.

06:07.076 --> 06:08.327
Sandy?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.703
What?

06:09.745 --> 06:11.163
I want to have
a party tonight.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.580
She's dead.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.790
After curfew.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.000
So,

06:12.831 --> 06:14.625
Why do you want
to have a party?

06:13.791 --> 06:15.751
I'm happy here now.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.628
Because that's what young people
in the real world do.

06:15.042 --> 06:19.338
what that lady told you
in the hotel in Bucharest

06:15.793 --> 06:17.419
So am I.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.464
Like, get drunk and have fun.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.006
is the truth.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.299
How are we gonna get drunk?

06:21.757 --> 06:23.258
Hanna?

06:22.341 --> 06:24.635
We don't have anything
to get drunk with.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.177
Your mother is dead.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.179
:
Not yet we don't.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.555
Look after yourself.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.681
I'm really sorry.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.724
It was a bad one,
car's a write-off.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.392
We towed it,
cleared the scene.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.560
Did you search her?

06:33.602 --> 06:35.604
And the car-- both clean.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.606
It hurts, right?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.651
That's why none
of the girls here

06:40.692 --> 06:42.319
have been told
about any of that.

06:42.361 --> 06:45.489
About parents or any kind
of previous life.

06:45.531 --> 06:50.494
See, the truth is, without us,
none of you would be alive.

06:46.323 --> 06:49.118
The English countryside.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.620
There always was something
lawless about it.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.747
I'm not gonna sugarcoat that
for you. Okay?

06:51.662 --> 06:53.539
My fault.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.999
I fell asleep at the wheel.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.130
If you want any life at all,

07:00.546 --> 07:03.048
Well, you look exhausted.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.173
it has to be here.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.470
Yeah, I've not been sleeping
as well as I should.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.180
What happened to Hanna?

07:10.556 --> 07:13.100
When you told me
that she was alive.

07:14.059 --> 07:18.021
Hanna tried to kill the people
we sent to pick her up.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.478
I don't know why.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.900
There was a lot of firepower.
We were forced to respond.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.316
This stuff from the past,
just comes back.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.862
I understand.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.572
I'm afraid she didn't make it.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.326
Can I see her?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.078
LEO:
You travel separately

07:32.911 --> 07:34.705
It's not your fault.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.080
and meet there.
Mia, you're first.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.208
Well, I have something
I want to show you first.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.540
Hanna chose to break
into the facility.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.957
Take the front car.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.750
Her decision, not yours.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.252
Come.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.170
See you later.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.256
-Bye.
-LEO: Good luck. And remember,

07:44.298 --> 07:47.426
you've done this a hundred times
before in training.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
Jules... can I have a word?

07:50.012 --> 07:51.972
Ma'am.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.975
It's okay.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.770
It's okay.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.936
How long do you need, Larry?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.688
I'm just completing
the protocol.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.106
Yeah, all right,
go ahead and finish up.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.566
And the rest of you,
will you clear out,

08:02.608 --> 08:03.567
please, give us the space?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.861
I'm okay.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.195
Uh, pull up that file first,

08:05.903 --> 08:08.488
We're good.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.821
if you don't mind.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.500
Yeah, thanks.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.297
Can I show you something?

08:28.592 --> 08:30.594
Look at this.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.221
This way.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.600
When, way back,
we first conceived

08:36.516 --> 08:39.478
This is Larry. Say hi, Larry.

08:36.642 --> 08:39.311
of what they might be...

08:39.519 --> 08:41.521
Hi.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.148
...this was exactly it.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.985
You want her back in.

08:44.816 --> 08:49.404
:
I know this place.
This is Camp G.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.736
LEO:
Recognize them?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.112
She's still not communicating.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.905
Where are they?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.949
And we've tried everything.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.324
We interrogated Hanna here.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.617
They're right here.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.743
Or almost everything.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.869
MALE VOICE:
We asked John Carmichael
to send you here

08:55.077 --> 08:58.121
-Oh, my God!

08:55.911 --> 08:57.913
because we have some
questions of our own.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.373
Okay.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.541
Oh, my God...

08:59.915 --> 09:02.042
The night you tried to
escape from the Meadows,

09:01.583 --> 09:03.293
SONIA:
She arrived back in Paris

09:02.084 --> 09:04.002
someone helped you.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.503
Take me to her.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.046
at 1500 hours,
flew into Orly Airport.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.545
Who was it?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.590
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.048
She returned to the offices
this morning.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.675
I've sent over all visuals.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.969
Carmichael said you were
a good liar.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.260
CARMICHAEL:
Did anyone come see her?

09:11.301 --> 09:14.096
No one.
I think her boyfriend's left.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.223
Other than that,
everything seems normal.

09:14.513 --> 09:18.558
Two dead guards, one shot
with a high-velocity rifle,

09:16.265 --> 09:18.392
Let me tell you
something, Sonia.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.394
When I taught Marissa Wiegler
at the training college,

09:18.600 --> 09:21.144
the other got his neck
snapped in two.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.479
no one noticed her
for two years.

09:21.186 --> 09:25.232
You sent a message to a friend,
told them where you were going.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.107
She was just average,
slept with a couple guys,

09:25.148 --> 09:26.942
smoked a little dope,
did the bare minimum.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.484
They came after you
and tried to help you.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.694
Final exams,
she was top of her class.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.861
Who were they?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.113
No one saw it coming.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.780
There wasn't anyone.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.864
So you stay on her.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.865
Don't act dumb.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.284
Watch her
very carefully, please.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.202
Does Hanna know about the
person that tried to help you?

09:35.325 --> 09:37.327
Anything strange, you call me.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.246
Did she see them that night?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.249
Hello, Hanna. Wait.

09:42.291 --> 09:46.003
You don't understand
what's happening here.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.043
How could she?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.671
There was no one there.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.380
You think you do.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.090
Who killed these men?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.590
But you don't.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.884
Because it sure as hell
wasn't you.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.305
Hear me out, please.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.851
It's been a while
since I last saw you.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.561
You look different.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.563
I like your hair.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
Did you dye it yourself?

10:09.067 --> 10:13.196
Does the code name Tacitus
mean anything to you?

10:09.860 --> 10:11.778
I'm sorry about all this.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.781
I crashed my car.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.699
Fuck.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.242
Stupid mistake.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.037
Yeah.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.539
He's my dog.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.466
When I got the call,
saying they'd found you,

10:32.507 --> 10:36.219
I didn't know what to expect.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.889
They say you came
through Northern France,

10:38.930 --> 10:41.391
tracing your way back to Clara.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.310
You were following a shipment.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.771
Find it okay?

10:43.352 --> 10:45.687
Is that right?

10:47.481 --> 10:50.108
Hanna?

10:47.647 --> 10:50.275
-I brought food.
-I'm not hungry.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.402
Yes.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.614
Okay, then. Shall we do this?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.326
Do you recognize that woman?

10:59.368 --> 11:02.412
Her name is Sonia Richter.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.456
She's a CIA operative.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.209
She was sent to track your
movements and bring you in.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.753
We found her body
at a diner in Belgium.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.004
You don't have to say anything.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.798
We know you killed her.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.550
And we understand why.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.221
She was a threat to you.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.933
To what you were moving
towards, saving your friend.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.435
A threat to what you love.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.646
If it was me,

11:27.687 --> 11:29.981
I would've done the same.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.863
Arms straight.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.242
They tell me you've not
been cooperating

11:40.283 --> 11:42.244
since you've been here.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.203
Good.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.330
I want you to do
something for me.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.792
I want you to try
and work with me.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.836
And if you do,

11:50.877 --> 11:54.172
I might be able to help you.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.758
Help you see Clara,
help you be with her again.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.012
Do you understand?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.138
Hello, Mary. Is that you?

12:01.179 --> 12:03.223
-MARISSA: Hi, Mr. Kaladski.
-

12:03.265 --> 12:05.058
Please don't call me that.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.100
PEARL:
Like, I genuinely can't see

12:04.933 --> 12:07.352
You have to trust me, though.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.935
I haven't been your teacher
for 20 years.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.518
how she's your hero.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.854
She's excluded an entire gender
from her lectures.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.728
I just wondered
if you'd thought about

12:08.770 --> 12:10.814
what I asking you
a few days ago.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.313
I mean,
would she refuse to teach me?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.690
Do you trust me?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.274
I don't know,
and I'm not condoning that.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.108
Because the girl
I was telling you about

12:12.315 --> 12:14.693
But have you read Daly's
The Church and the Second Sex?

12:13.150 --> 12:14.776
is with me now.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.652
Maybe.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.487
-Yeah, but-- Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.278
Her name is Beatrice.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.448
Say hi, Beatrice.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.697
I'm Mia.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.532
I'm Pearl.
This is Jules.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.032
Hi.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.285
Believe me,
you won't regret it.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.076
Uh, hi there, Beatrice.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.869
I'm just here for the semester.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.120
Uh, Tom, Beatrice is in danger.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.412
Or whatever you Brits call it.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.456
She needs somewhere
that she can go.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.496
I'm a first-year undergrad.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.498
I started at Portsmouth Uni

12:27.497 --> 12:31.793
Somewhere that's
remote and safe.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.167
doing French and languages,

12:30.208 --> 12:31.460
but I didn't like it

12:31.501 --> 12:33.879
so I transferred.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.628
You know the line
of work I'm in.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.338
You know what it involves.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.215
Well, nice to meet you.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.174
You know that I wouldn't make
a call like this

12:37.215 --> 12:39.176
unless I really needed
your help.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.344
Did you speak to Jean?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.263
Yeah, I-I spoke to her.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.764
And?

12:44.806 --> 12:48.560
She wants to know
how long it would be for.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.813
A long time.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.566
And-and I-I suppose
we can't ask who she is.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.402
It's better if you don't.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.986
I hope she's not a dragon.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.738
Just think of her as a girl

12:59.654 --> 13:02.199
-I hope we're not too early.
-No, no.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
who deserves a fresh start.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.867
Come in.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.785
We love keen.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.997
:
The dangers facing mankind

13:08.413 --> 13:10.123
So,

13:09.039 --> 13:11.625
in the 21st century

13:10.165 --> 13:12.751
let's start with names,
shall we?

13:11.666 --> 13:13.835
require radical action.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
I'm Bethany.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.882
Sometimes pre-emptive action
that will guarantee

13:18.924 --> 13:21.801
all our security.

13:21.843 --> 13:26.306
That's why Utrax was created.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.931
I've just got to catch
my breath
-HELEN: Hey.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.682
-Sandy.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.893
To be the preventive force
that the world needs.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.727
-Sandy.
-What?

13:30.769 --> 13:32.145
We got to go to class.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.730
Fuck class.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.900
Sandy, you've been
in a terrible mood for days now.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.027
Just shut up, Helen.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.070
When I want lessons in mood,

13:40.111 --> 13:42.405
I'll let you know.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.908
-

13:43.240 --> 13:45.659
-

13:47.953 --> 13:49.829
Why them?

13:49.871 --> 13:52.249
Mia's been here
for just two months.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.168
Why her, huh?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.835
Hi.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.629
JULES:
Social media's

13:55.877 --> 13:57.879
Can I come in?

13:57.671 --> 13:59.464
open form structure
allows people

13:58.880 --> 14:00.674
I can come back later.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.299
from minority backgrounds
a voice

14:00.715 --> 14:02.717
No, it's okay.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.468
where they've
traditionally been silenced.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.555
PEARL:
Okay, so we have
a newfound voice online, great.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.888
Did you have a long journey?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.890
But, in real life,
it's actually very different.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.307
I think I saw you arrive
in the car.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.977
Besides, isn't real life
what actually matters?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.476
Where are we?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.687
The Meadows.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.979
JULES:
You can't separate the two as if
they're completely unconnected.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.730
But where is that?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.898
Social media's constantly
influencing our real life.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.112
SANDY:
Oh, cool, they gave you these.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.697
They're really cool.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.241
Cooler than mine.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.199
Yeah.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.451
LEO:
Sandy, come in.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.994
My name's Sandy now,
by the way.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.078
Hi.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.078
Sit down.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.078
Sandy?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.413
Like a beach?

14:31.454 --> 14:34.374
I guess, if the beach is sandy.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.085
Why did you come here?

14:37.127 --> 14:40.088
I wanted to see
if you were okay.

14:37.419 --> 14:38.878
So,

14:38.128 --> 14:40.130
Do you have a name?

14:38.920 --> 14:41.464
I hear you're feeling
a little passed over.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.174
Oh, no, not at all, sir.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.593
I'm fine.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.385
Well, it's time to remedy that.

14:45.427 --> 14:49.014
We have something we need you
and Clemency to do.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.764
"Clemency."

14:48.054 --> 14:50.724
I came to get you out.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.599
It involves travel abroad.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.808
That's so sweet.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.685
It's an active operation
with an element of risk.

14:50.765 --> 14:54.102
But now I know
that was a mistake.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.895
Do you both feel ready?

14:54.144 --> 14:55.729
Yeah, it was.
Can I go?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.940
They said if you were
okay with it,

14:58.982 --> 15:01.526
they could get you
to show me around.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.817
They're so beautiful.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.527
Have you written to them?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.029
Help me get to know the place.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.321
You should.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.072
Why?

15:04.362 --> 15:05.864
I write every day to my family.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.408
Almost.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.743
Because maybe I want
to stay here, too.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.577
Jules.

15:08.450 --> 15:12.037
Well, you should only do it
if you feel ready.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.662
Did you forget something?

15:12.078 --> 15:15.123
I have to go to piano now.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.247
No.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.416
I wondered...

15:15.165 --> 15:17.167
So, I'll see you later.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.126
Do you have a second?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.503
Sure.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.671
It's good to have you back.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.176
What's up?

15:26.009 --> 15:28.970
-WOMAN: Reach.
-This is where we do
indoor training.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.639
WOMAN:
Six, seven, eight.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.099
One, two, three, four,

15:30.847 --> 15:32.849
I'm sorry.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.019
five, six, seven, eight.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.060
Hey.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.562
I just...

15:36.061 --> 15:39.147
:
One, two, three, four,

15:39.189 --> 15:41.566
five, six, seven, eight.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.359
I don't think
I'm coping very well.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.069
One, two...

15:43.401 --> 15:46.613
I know I act all...

15:44.110 --> 15:45.445
This is the main building,

15:45.487 --> 15:47.947
where we have our classes
and dorm rooms.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.658
super confident in class
and everything.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.034
Hi, Clemency.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.412
But it's just a lie.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.413
Why did she call you that?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.457
Clemency's my name now.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.458
Well, you're a long way
from home.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.252
That can be overwhelming.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.212
:
Hip-hop is a musical
and artistic movement

16:02.253 --> 16:05.590
characterized by the four main
pillars of hip-hop culture:

16:05.382 --> 16:07.842
Do you want to go grab a coffee?

16:05.632 --> 16:10.428
rapping, deejaying,
break dancing and graffiti.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.386
If you have time,

16:09.427 --> 16:12.013
which you obviously don't.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.764
Originating from the
South Bronx...

16:12.055 --> 16:15.517
I have time.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.600
My room's this way.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.852
-

16:32.701 --> 16:34.911
This is where you sleep?

16:32.701 --> 16:35.036
Oh, my wife's here. Come on.
Come and meet her.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.413
Mm-hmm.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.625
I'm sure she'd love to meet you.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.876
Does she work here as well?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.670
No, she's a journalist,
actually.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.338
JULES:
Oh, wow. Really?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.048
Who are these people?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.675
They're my family.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.386
My parents.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.555
Your family?

16:53.596 --> 16:54.848
Yes.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.975
:
Oh, it's just
a few minutes' walk.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.017
:
It's no problem at all.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.479
We should go.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.066
Clara...

17:05.108 --> 17:07.068
Clemency.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.986
JULES:
Bethany invited me back
to their place

17:06.568 --> 17:07.610
Sonia?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.362
But your name isn't Clemency.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.654
Have a look at this.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.989
for this political gathering
thing.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.199
I'm just getting you in there.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.367
The rest is up to you.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.535
Okay, let me guess the routine.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.036
Yeah.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.538
You call John Carmichael
once a day.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.121
I should show you
around the place.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.415
Maybe when you go
to get coffee for the team.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.667
What's funny?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.167
I've noticed
you like to do that.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.503
You call and you report
on my movements.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.753
It's weird.

17:24.794 --> 17:28.006
I thought it would feel new,

17:25.545 --> 17:27.380
You include in your report
my domestic routine,

17:27.422 --> 17:30.675
as catalogued by those two
clowns outside my apartment.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.093
but it just feels kind of like
another training exercise,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.343
You think maybe I'm about
to meet a journalist

17:32.135 --> 17:34.387
like I've done it before.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.179
or police even.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.016
Maybe I'm about to betray Utrax.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.809
I wonder
if Sandy feels the same.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.310
Tell Carmichael this.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.021
I'm not betraying anyone.

17:41.311 --> 17:44.230
What does that mean?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.815
I'm tired and lonely.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.108
Nothing.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.067
My boyfriend left me
while I was chasing Erik Heller

17:47.150 --> 17:48.860
No, Jules.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.486
across half of Eastern Europe,

17:48.902 --> 17:50.195
What did you mean by that?

17:49.527 --> 17:51.029
and I am now trying
to get him back.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.863
No secrets.
We're on the same team.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.530
During which time
I would very much appreciate

17:52.572 --> 17:53.990
some fucking privacy.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.163
Sandy and Clemency
are in Barcelona.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.246
I have Carmichael's number
on this card.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.289
Leo told me.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.333
I will call him if I want.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.457
Where are they?

18:01.331 --> 18:02.874
Why?

18:02.499 --> 18:05.210
-Call security.
-Code red, all units.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.877
They're covering the operation
on both sides.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.085
And in the meantime,
if I see your face again

18:05.251 --> 18:07.712
Code red, all units.
Trainees out-of-bounds.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.670
around my private life,

18:07.712 --> 18:09.172
I'll rip it off
and mail it to him.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.897
I tried to find you.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.067
But when I came to the hotel
in Bucharest, you weren't there,

18:29.108 --> 18:31.569
and I thought you were dead.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.072
No, I'm fine.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.326
It's my fault.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.078
I didn't listen to you
about your mother.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.832
-I'm sorry.
-My mother's dead.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.500
I know.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.381
What are you doing?

18:51.422 --> 18:53.216
We don't have long.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.303
Agency or, uh...

18:57.345 --> 18:58.471
personal?

19:01.683 --> 19:03.268
You can't take it out.
They'll notice.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.229
But you don't need it.
They just want to keep you numb.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.563
I need a few more days
to organize this.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.148
I can't take it out, Hanna.
They'll notice.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.691
Oh, sorry...
I don't speak Spanish very well.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.776
You don't want me to cut it out.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.943
You need help with the bags?

19:10.191 --> 19:13.695
Keep away from the windows
at all times.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.862
What are you talking about?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.570
Oh, no, I'm good.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.154
I just rented an apartment here.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.738
Don't answer the phone
or the doors, okay?

19:15.196 --> 19:17.532
-4A?
-Yeah. It's just up there.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.074
You don't, do you?

19:17.574 --> 19:19.576
Nice.

19:18.116 --> 19:21.828
They fill you with drugs
and you let them.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.451
Hanna?

19:19.617 --> 19:20.702
You're American.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.580
-Right?
-Yeah.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.079
They think you're dead.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.748
You have to stay that way.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.957
Take a year off, traveling.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.542
Look at yourself.
What is this?

19:25.999 --> 19:28.585
That's cool.
Where have you been?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.586
It's a whole new life
I'm offering you.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.044
What about it?

19:28.626 --> 19:31.296
Paris for a month.
And Rome.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.213
No one will know
where you've gone.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.338
They do it to everyone.
They'll do it to you, too.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.298
Now here.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.299
He's an old teacher of mine,
no other connection.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.966
No, they won't.
I didn't come here to join you.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.300
I'm Clemency.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.759
No one will trace you.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.718
I came here to get you out.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.302
Juan.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.303
How the hell are you gonna
do that?

19:38.344 --> 19:41.014
: There's a place
in Canada, it's beautiful.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.807
Passports, new names,

19:42.348 --> 19:44.183
I know Erik offered you this.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.144
tickets for both of us.
A new life.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.477
But he couldn't deliver it,
and I can.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.146
It's all been arranged.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.898
We just have to get out of here.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
Where did they take Clara?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.275
-Arranged by who?
-Marissa Wiegler.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.402
She's here.
She's going to help us.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.945
No idea,
but I know there's nothing

19:55.987 --> 19:57.989
that you can do for her now.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.740
You know none of this is real.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.451
These clothes are fake.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.578
The photos in your room
are fake.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.872
They're training you
to kill people.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.916
That's all they want.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.627
Isn't that why you tried
to leave in the first place?

20:10.668 --> 20:13.046
I wanted to leave
because I wasn't free.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.338
Don't walk away.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.632
: You're not free.
-You don't know that.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.174
Just talk to me
for a second, okay?

20:15.673 --> 20:18.176
Try to leave.
See how free you are.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.717
Oh.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.802
Just thought I'd say hi.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.345
-

20:19.636 --> 20:22.180
I'm Stephen Mannion.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.262
-Sorry.
-Oh, please.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.555
This isn't your home.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.513
Don't bother.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.599
I work for a group
that's trying to expose Utrax

20:22.555 --> 20:23.765
My mother said I was always

20:22.597 --> 20:25.099
I don't have a home.
So what difference does it make?

20:23.806 --> 20:25.016
the messiest pup in the litter.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.726
and the organization behind it.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.559
-I'm John Carmichael.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.142
Yes, you do. With me.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.603
-

20:26.601 --> 20:28.353
Terri Miller, sir.

20:26.768 --> 20:30.146
Marissa called me when
she learned about the Meadows.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.730
You come very highly
recommended.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.855
Come with me, Clara.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.689
You're involved with some
dangerous people,

20:30.772 --> 20:32.273
Well, I hope to not disappoint.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.316
and I need to know
what they want from you.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.650
MAN:
This way! Move it!

20:32.315 --> 20:34.359
I see you're watching
our latest arrival.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.610
Please.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.526
Yeah.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.778
Stay away from me.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.988
-Hanna, please...
-I said stay away.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.572
-MAN: Behind this door, come on!
-Okay.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.864
Who is she?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.157
I work with them now.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.282
MAN:
Door is locked.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.617
Just someone
we lost for a while.

20:41.199 --> 20:44.327
Please, whatever they want you
to do, don't do it.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.993
-Open up!

20:42.659 --> 20:44.077
"Lost"?

20:44.118 --> 20:45.912
She's a rebel, I guess,
but like God,

20:45.954 --> 20:48.206
we value our rebels highly.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.622
Stand back.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.541
You did really good work
on her material.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.960
I'll be here.
Same time every day.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.669
Big family-- generous,
but not holier than thou.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.754
-Just what she needs.
-It's the kind of the family

20:54.796 --> 20:56.422
I would've dreamed of as a kid.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.547
What are you doing here?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.216
Brothers and sisters everywhere.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.008
Just having a smoke.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.801
Ah, you're an only child?

20:59.050 --> 21:01.302
For old time's sake.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.010
Yeah.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.470
Loved but lonely.

21:03.721 --> 21:07.141
-Get out of here.
-

21:06.099 --> 21:09.978
We just need
to give her more time.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.560
Come on!

21:11.229 --> 21:12.647
You're late.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.732
I know. I'm sorry.
I got lost.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.025
What is it?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.486
Booze for the staff,
so they can unwind

21:18.444 --> 21:20.863
and out of tune...

21:18.528 --> 21:20.446
after all the stress
we cause them.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.864
Who told you about this?

21:20.905 --> 21:23.032
So, I think I did something

21:21.906 --> 21:23.282
Leo accidentally let slip

21:23.074 --> 21:24.909
that was maybe a bit stupid.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.785
that a delivery
was arriving today.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.911
What did you do?

21:25.827 --> 21:27.203
-Okay. Let's go.
-Are you sure?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.329
JULES:
I split up with Aaron.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.413
Move.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.455
Oh, my God.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.040
:

21:28.913 --> 21:31.708
-Oh, you came.
-Yeah.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.957
Why?

21:30.999 --> 21:33.167
I-I thought you liked him.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.626
What are you doing here?
This is staff only.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.918
Thank you.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.586
I changed my mind.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.295
Sorry, is this out-of-bounds?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.004
I brought Mia.
I hope that's okay.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.213
your vitamin...

21:36.045 --> 21:38.506
Yeah, of course.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.881
You know it is.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.133
Wow.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.133
Come in, come in.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.259
every single day...

21:40.174 --> 21:42.760
What?

21:41.300 --> 21:45.013
I just saw that you had
chocolate milkshake,

21:42.802 --> 21:44.971
How did you do it?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.306
I messaged him, obviously.

21:45.054 --> 21:49.100
-in the delivery.
-MAN: So... what?

21:47.348 --> 21:49.308
Well, what did he say?

21:48.683 --> 21:51.686
Bethany, is that academic here?
The one you mentioned?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.935
SANDY:
So, I...

21:49.350 --> 21:52.395
He was really upset.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.770
was just wondering

21:51.728 --> 21:53.187
You mean Leslie Neil?

21:52.437 --> 21:54.981
And then Mom tried
to change my mind.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.357
if you could spare me one?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.939
Sure, I'll introduce you.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.190
Mia, do you want to meet her?

21:55.023 --> 21:56.441
Whoever Mom is.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.109
She lectures on female violence
in popular culture.

21:56.399 --> 22:00.278
-You want a chocolate milkshake?
-SANDY: Yeah.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.734
I can't believe you did that.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.027
I thought Aaron was so hot.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.360
She's fucking awesome.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.153
You like him so much,

21:59.402 --> 22:01.612
It's okay. I'm gonna go and
grab myself a drink.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.280
you fucking go out with him.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.864
MAN: You can just get it
in the cafeteria, you know.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.032
You curse too much.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.491
I know, but you have to pay.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.742
I what?

22:05.533 --> 22:09.495
And it tastes better when
it's not from the cafeteria.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.618
I don't understand you, Jules.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.787
I mean, why make
everything so difficult?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.456
Now they have
to find you another guy.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.832
What if I don't want
another guy?

22:11.539 --> 22:13.207
Does it now?

22:12.874 --> 22:15.293
What do you mean?

22:15.251 --> 22:17.211
SANDY:
Yeah.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.421
Why does it always
have to be about guys?

22:17.670 --> 22:20.214
You caught me.

22:18.463 --> 22:21.591
Haven't you read
anything, Sandy?

22:20.256 --> 22:22.884
Dutch courage.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.428
Like... in here they have

22:21.799 --> 22:24.385
nah, nah

22:22.925 --> 22:25.303
Never been one for parties.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.722
Me neither.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.388
this absurd hetero-normal notion

22:27.263 --> 22:29.182
I'm Sandy, by the way.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.640
about who we should be.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.892
Oh, I know.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.267
It's, like, totally 1950s.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.686
I'm from Bentleyville, Ohio.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.561
What?

22:33.603 --> 22:35.980
How do you know anything
about the 1950s?

22:33.728 --> 22:35.313
Where are you from?

22:33.853 --> 22:37.315
Are you one of Beth's students?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.940
You know I can't tell you that.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.356
-Forget it.
-No...

22:37.356 --> 22:39.317
Yes. I just arrived.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.900
Sandy, leave it.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.401
Yeah, I know.

22:38.941 --> 22:42.278
Go back to your dead-eyed
magazine world.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.902
Are you a professor, too?

22:40.443 --> 22:42.111
You can't even tell me
your real name.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.780
Uh, no.
I'm a journalist.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.698
Leave me to expand my mind.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.740
What kind?

22:44.822 --> 22:48.826
Well, thanks, anyways.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.576
I expand my mind.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.409
Um...

22:48.451 --> 22:51.329
investigative,
I suppose you'd say.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.161
All the time.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.078
Whoever you are.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.205
Sure you do.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.582
I'd like to do something
like that one day.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.664
Anytime.

22:54.624 --> 22:57.668
Well, get ready for
a lot of late nights

22:57.710 --> 23:00.254
and low wages. Hmm.

23:02.173 --> 23:04.509
What are you working on
at the moment?

23:05.551 --> 23:07.970
This and that.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.224
How did you get into it?

23:12.225 --> 23:14.102
Do you really want to know?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.270
All done here.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.231
Thanks, man.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.732
Um, sorry. I have to take this.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.858
MAN:
What's this all about, Leo?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.401
Just teaching the young

23:21.150 --> 23:22.777
Hello?

23:22.443 --> 23:24.612
a little disobedience.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.279
Yeah, it's me.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.657
Otherwise, how are they
going to convince anyone?

23:26.322 --> 23:27.448
I'm just gonna go

23:27.490 --> 23:28.866
somewhere I can talk.

23:39.043 --> 23:42.547
Hanna, this is John Carmichael,

23:41.963 --> 23:43.881
Yeah. We're ready to publish.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.465
-the director of the Meadows.
-

23:43.923 --> 23:45.383
No, my-my editor understands

23:44.507 --> 23:46.884
Hi, Hanna.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.468
that you want
to do the handover face-to-face.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.263
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

23:47.510 --> 23:50.221
Yeah. He's happy to pay
for my flight to Barcelona

23:50.263 --> 23:51.764
to meet you.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.764
Uh, you went
a little out-of-bounds there.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.433
The staff laundry room
is just for staff.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.183
We'll protect your identity
at all times.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.727
We'll get a Barcelona journalist
involved, as well,

23:54.475 --> 23:57.895
It's okay,
but please don't do it again.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.312
so it'll give the exposure
more reach.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.274
How are you feeling
after this morning?

23:58.354 --> 24:00.439
No, I know a great reporter.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.692
Her name is Alba Paredes.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.692
I'm okay.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.694
You can trust her.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.528
CARMICHAEL:
How was the facility?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.696
I can be there in two days.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.572
Did you like it?

24:06.737 --> 24:08.030
Hotel Oriental?

24:08.072 --> 24:09.615
Sure. I'll-I'll stay there, too.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.660
It was different
to what I expected.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.284
See you there.

24:12.702 --> 24:15.663
Different to what
you saw before, right?

24:15.705 --> 24:17.081
Very different.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.125
CARMICHAEL:
Better?

24:20.293 --> 24:22.795
Well, that's good,

24:22.837 --> 24:24.088
because we'd like

24:24.130 --> 24:26.632
to talk about next steps.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.759
We'd like you
to consider staying here.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.761
What do you think, Hanna?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.722
You willing to give it a try?

24:37.727 --> 24:39.145
Um...

24:41.147 --> 24:43.733
I know it's hard to trust us.

24:43.774 --> 24:47.195
Uh, le café, le café...

24:43.774 --> 24:46.694
You've been fighting us
a long time.

24:46.736 --> 24:50.448
I-It's in your blood
to break the rules.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.992
It's what Erik taught me.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.369
CARMICHAEL:
I know.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.954
But sometimes,

24:56.996 --> 24:59.582
it's okay to stop fighting.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.177
Hey. It's okay.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.430
It's okay.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.060
I'm just so tired.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.103
Yeah.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.110
I lost you.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.904
I just went to see my friend.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.781
Are you okay?

25:32.823 --> 25:34.075
Yeah. I just...

25:33.157 --> 25:35.660
CARMICHAEL:
So, um,

25:35.701 --> 25:38.913
we'll go and set
everything up for you.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.121
Where was I?

25:38.955 --> 25:43.584
You'll need a new identity,
a new name.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.750
I worked on an investigation

25:42.792 --> 25:44.961
into the Magdalene Laundries.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.254
It's what we do for everybody.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.671
What are they?

25:46.712 --> 25:49.257
You never heard of them?

25:48.589 --> 25:50.549
Thank you.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.217
Oh.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.220
Um, young Irish women,

25:54.262 --> 25:55.972
almost all poor,

25:56.013 --> 25:58.182
some prostitutes,

25:57.515 --> 25:59.517
Chloe?

25:58.224 --> 26:00.518
some pregnant out of wedlock,

26:00.559 --> 26:03.813
some just abandoned
by their families,

26:03.854 --> 26:08.734
were sent to these
Catholic-run institutions.

26:08.693 --> 26:11.529
-You've got chocolate
on your lip.
-

26:08.776 --> 26:11.529
And they were locked up,
and they were never let out.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.739
-Where have you two been?
-

26:12.571 --> 26:15.241
They were tortured, abused.

26:13.781 --> 26:17.201
All trainees
to the main hall now.

26:15.283 --> 26:18.202
They lived
in hideous conditions.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.579
Some of them had babies
taken away from them,

26:20.621 --> 26:22.957
and they never saw them again.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.418
They know.
They fucking know.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.543
Many of them died

26:25.459 --> 26:27.378
-Jules, what have you done?
-Shut up.

26:25.584 --> 26:30.131
and were buried there
in unnamed graves.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.380
McCOY:
Okay. Sit down, everyone.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.048
This won't take long.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.718
I, uh...

26:33.759 --> 26:35.720
I did a piece on that.

26:35.678 --> 26:39.056
There's something
I need to tell you all.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.763
The cover-up.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.517
We have a visitor.

26:39.849 --> 26:42.810
Is that all true?

26:42.852 --> 26:44.395
Yeah.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.063
It is.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.565
Sadly.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.483
You all right?

26:54.989 --> 26:58.576
CARMICHAEL:
I want to introduce you
to our latest recruit.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.784
MAN:
Stand by! Engage!

26:58.617 --> 27:01.579
Some of you may remember her
from a previous occasion,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.998
but I want you to erase that
from your mind.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.250
-Engage!
-

27:04.040 --> 27:06.417
This is a fresh start.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.836
Her name now is Mia Wolff.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.004
You seen Sandy?

27:08.502 --> 27:10.546
TERRI:
These are the photos Mia sent us

27:08.878 --> 27:11.047
She's from Germany.

27:10.046 --> 27:12.757
I think she's at music now.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.966
of Nicola Gough's notebook.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.008
Given Mia's arrival,
I would also like to take

27:12.798 --> 27:14.425
But she'll be in the cafe later.

27:14.008 --> 27:16.510
She uses a variation
of Teeline shorthand,

27:14.050 --> 27:17.428
this opportunity to talk
to you about your futures.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.221
MAN:
Group! Clear your weapons!

27:16.552 --> 27:17.970
but it's unique to her,

27:17.470 --> 27:20.431
Pretty soon, there'll be a
period of service in your life,

27:18.012 --> 27:19.680
which means that she'll refer
to her notes

27:19.722 --> 27:21.474
but no one can easily decode it.

27:20.473 --> 27:23.601
in service of your country,
of the free world.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.267
Except you have.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.604
TERRI:
Time and again
she refers to Tacitus as R.G.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.603
That period of service
won't come without risk.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.146
You're soldiers, you know that.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.647
WOMAN:
That'll be two dollars, please.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.105
LEO:
Did you cross-check

27:27.188 --> 27:31.442
And with risk comes reward.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.982
-with Hotel Oriental?
-Yeah, but there are

27:30.024 --> 27:32.860
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.609
no guests booked to stay
under those initials.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.444
When you're finished
with your years with us,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.277
But...

27:33.319 --> 27:36.364
there is an American student
studying politics

27:33.486 --> 27:35.196
you'll be given a new life.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.282
Fully paid for, fully supported.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.908
at the University of Barcelona.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.911
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:38.324 --> 27:42.620
Same name, same family,
the same person you are now.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.284
Kat Gelder.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.661
Her father is Robert Gelder,

27:41.952 --> 27:44.121
You want a juice?
I could get you one.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.456
In my heart, I hope and believe

27:42.703 --> 27:44.413
and he's a lawyer
in the military.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.247
I'm okay.

27:44.455 --> 27:47.958
He just took an unexpected leave
from work.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.666
that you will find
love and happiness,

27:47.291 --> 27:49.001
You could try mine.
It's apple.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.920
maybe even have
children of your own

27:48.000 --> 27:49.668
And he has
Code B classified access

27:49.043 --> 27:50.878
No, thanks.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.961
to intelligence files.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.172
who will live in a safer world
thanks to what you did

27:52.171 --> 27:54.924
We think Tacitus
is a military lawyer

27:53.214 --> 27:55.800
in your period of service.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.009
called Robert Gelder.

27:55.841 --> 27:59.136
You are a bunch
of very remarkable young women.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.426
You could try the clothes,
you know.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.846
I could help you.
With your makeup and all.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.304
You know him?

27:59.178 --> 28:00.763
And I want to thank you
from my heart

28:00.346 --> 28:01.972
Only by name.

28:00.805 --> 28:02.515
for what you're doing here.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.015
I mean, if you want to.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.350
His daughter's studying
in Barcelona.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.643
And I want to welcome Mia
to the Meadows.

28:03.057 --> 28:06.143
-There's no rush.
-You know the girl who broke in?

28:04.392 --> 28:05.893
We think he's using her
as cover.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.645
He's coming
in the next two days.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.978
The one I left with?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.355
Check his flight status.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.147
In Romania.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.315
We already have.
He has nothing reserved yet.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.233
What about her?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.400
Keep checking.

28:12.274 --> 28:14.026
She's dead.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.110
I want to know
the second he travels.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.947
Start a tracking operation
on the daughter.

28:16.070 --> 28:19.657
Oh. I'm sorry.

28:17.988 --> 28:21.409
Give London the green light
to intercept Nicola Gough.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.867
We were in the forest together.

28:21.450 --> 28:24.036
Sir...

28:21.909 --> 28:24.078
But then I left.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.414
Why did you leave?

28:25.079 --> 28:27.748
What does Tacitus know?

28:26.455 --> 28:27.915
I thought I could find
my mother.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.042
But they guessed
that I'd look for her

28:28.791 --> 28:30.668
Thank you, Leo.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.211
and they tricked me.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.170
Hi, Clemency.

28:32.253 --> 28:35.673
Actually, I was trying
to work out how they knew...

28:33.212 --> 28:35.631
-Hey.
-We wondered where you were.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.091
You weren't in class.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.051
that I discovered
about my mother.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.676
Oh, no, I got called out.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.595
I figure someone
must have told them.

28:40.678 --> 28:42.805
This is my friend.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.598
Oh, yeah?

28:42.847 --> 28:46.600
Yeah. We remember her.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.767
Yeah.

28:46.642 --> 28:50.563
Mia, right? So it was you
who broke in yesterday.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.602
Someone must have seen me

28:48.644 --> 28:51.397
looking at my mother's name
on the computer system that day.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.524
Apparently, you took out,
like, 50 guards.

28:51.439 --> 28:52.773
And then told on me.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.733
Jules.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.694
And then I realized

28:54.775 --> 28:57.862
I didn't take out 50 guards.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.196
that your door
was the only one open.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.865
Then your standards
are slipping.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.449
Because I opened it.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.907
We'll get you out.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.075
Soon.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.326
I'm Sandy.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.618
Okay?

29:03.617 --> 29:07.538
Did you help them find me...
242?

29:04.368 --> 29:05.911
-Hi.
-JULES: Sandy just stole,

29:05.619 --> 29:07.455
Just hang in there.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.913
like, a whole crate of vodka.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.040
My name's not 242, it's Sandy.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.332
-Actually, you stole it.
-You should've seen her.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.418
-Did you help them?
-Course not.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.001
She was talking to this guy,
who, like, totally

29:11.292 --> 29:12.751
Stupid bitch!

29:12.042 --> 29:14.295
-had the hots for her.
-He did not.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.173
-We should go.
-See you later, Clem.

29:17.131 --> 29:20.217
I didn't mean to.
They asked me questions.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.260
SANDY:
See you around, Mia.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.928
-And you answered the questions?
-What was I supposed to do?

29:22.970 --> 29:25.097
They said they could bring you
back here and make you safe.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.766
And you decided that
that is what I wanted?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.476
SANDY:
"Hi, Mom. Big news today.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.060
I just wanted to help.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.728
"A new arrival has
changed everything.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.563
I mean, look around here.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.563
"She's lonely,

29:32.605 --> 29:34.315
It's beautiful.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.232
"and some people don't like her
because of her past,

29:35.274 --> 29:38.527
"but I think people should be
given the chance to change.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.987
You think you know
what's best for me? 242?

29:38.569 --> 29:40.696
Don't you?"

29:40.029 --> 29:42.239
My name is not 242.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.992
-You think you know?
-Get the hell off me.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.046
with a bikini in Bequia

29:57.087 --> 30:00.257
Galliano sack me

30:00.299 --> 30:03.177
like your freaking acne

30:03.219 --> 30:05.971
brand new perspective

30:05.304 --> 30:07.431
LEO:
Today we're looking
at a classic

30:06.013 --> 30:09.767
with matching red lipstick

30:07.473 --> 30:09.058
two-operative mission.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.602
We call it Face and Trigger.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.977
I got front

30:11.644 --> 30:13.020
McCOY:
In this scenario,

30:12.019 --> 30:15.773
I got a trunk

30:13.062 --> 30:15.064
Operative A is the face.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.858
throw it in the bank bank

30:17.107 --> 30:20.819
The objective of the face
is to befriend the target,

30:17.900 --> 30:20.986
but this ain't what you think

30:20.861 --> 30:22.655
make social contact,

30:22.696 --> 30:25.366
discover the target's routines
and vulnerabilities.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.910
Your age and your gender will
protect you from suspicion,

30:26.408 --> 30:27.618
-

30:27.952 --> 30:29.411
and your support team
will make sure

30:29.453 --> 30:31.038
that your identity checks out,

30:31.080 --> 30:33.832
-should the target
choose to dig into that.
-LEO: Operative B

30:31.288 --> 30:33.123
-

30:33.874 --> 30:35.876
is the trigger.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.337
I guess that one
explains itself, right?

30:38.379 --> 30:40.047
-Here's the key.

30:40.089 --> 30:44.051
The face creates the space
for the trigger to do her work.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.298
Wow.

30:44.093 --> 30:46.095
The two operatives may decide
to meet in public,

30:44.093 --> 30:46.470
I think that's, um,
Jacob's sister.

30:46.136 --> 30:49.181
but no one must suspect
you know each other.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.472
YOUNG MAN:
Jacob? You know that guy?

30:48.514 --> 30:51.433
KAT:
I think he does chemistry.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.684
That's your secret.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.562
That's the power you have.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.316
CARMICHAEL:
She fits right in.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.525
PROFESSOR:
Okay.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.193
She has a home.

30:59.567 --> 31:03.654
So today, we're looking at
consensus and conflict

31:01.235 --> 31:03.654
It's what she always wanted.

31:01.986 --> 31:03.028
It's me.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.448
within the African Nationalist
movements of the 1950s...

31:05.489 --> 31:07.283
Hanna?

31:06.115 --> 31:10.411
But it means my work
is done here.

31:08.492 --> 31:12.329
I'm sorry.
I swear I had it.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.288
Hanna?

31:10.452 --> 31:11.704
You're sure you want to leave?

31:12.371 --> 31:13.956
Can you stand aside, please?

31:12.913 --> 31:14.873
I'm not a part of this, John.

31:13.998 --> 31:16.083
-Yeah, sure.
-Next.

31:14.915 --> 31:17.876
You only brought me in because
you had no other options.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.127
Kat, have you lost your wallet?

31:17.918 --> 31:20.212
You put a hood on my head
to drive me here.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.588
Fuck.

31:20.254 --> 31:23.048
I'm aware this whole operation
began in the shadows.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.090
: Fuck.
-Excuse me.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.009
I kn... I know what it cost you.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.926
Katherine Gelder?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.052
And I know we froze you out
for a while.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.845
Is this yours?

31:27.094 --> 31:29.513
15 years.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.181
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

31:29.555 --> 31:33.434
We are so close, Marissa.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.309
I found it on a seat
in the lecture hall.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.060
It must have fallen out
of my bag.

31:33.475 --> 31:36.270
Any day now, these girls will be
ready to go out into the world.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.104
-I am so vacant today.
-You're always vacant.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.564
-They're gonna need support.
-Meaning?

31:37.146 --> 31:38.105
Shut up, Ray.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.524
: I'm Ray.
-Sandy Phillips.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.985
I'd love to welcome you back
with open arms.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.152
Do you study here?
I haven't seen you around.

31:43.027 --> 31:46.196
Mm-hmm.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.737
I've been in the city
a couple of months.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.363
I'm doing business
at the business school?

31:46.238 --> 31:49.825
And are you gonna
tell me the truth?

31:46.405 --> 31:48.866
But I like to dip
into politics too, sometimes.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.117
: I'm a nerd.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.328
Are you gonna tell me
who's behind this operation?

31:50.159 --> 31:51.452
Where do you live?

31:51.493 --> 31:53.954
-Oh, just in
a rented room downtown.
-Cool.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.414
Who's paying for it?
Who's giving the orders?

31:53.996 --> 31:57.374
Did your parents really like
Grease or something?

31:57.416 --> 32:01.086
-Uh, no. Th-They holiday
in Cali every year.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.794
As I thought.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.422
Oh, no-no-no...
he meant the film.

32:03.464 --> 32:05.341
Oh... why?

32:04.882 --> 32:07.801
-Could I ask you
to arrange a car?
-Sure.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.802
KAT:
Your name...
blonde hair, high pony?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.220
I'll have someone take you back
first thing in the morning.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.348
-It-it doesn't matter.
It's fine.
-

32:10.262 --> 32:12.139
-Uh, don't want
you crashing again.

32:12.181 --> 32:13.766
Right?

32:12.389 --> 32:15.351
Do you to want to come
and eat with us, Sandy?

32:13.807 --> 32:17.478
Well, I would rather go tonight
if that's possible.

32:15.392 --> 32:19.063
-Sure. That'd be great.
-

32:17.519 --> 32:20.356
I'll see what I can do.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.857
Hi. I missed
the lecture earlier.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.774
HANNA:
We leave tonight.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.359
-10:00.
-There's a curfew at 9:00.

32:21.899 --> 32:25.194
-Can I copy your notes?
-Sure.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.152
How do we get there?

32:25.194 --> 32:28.364
Hi, Mia. I'm Helen.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.698
What's up?

32:28.405 --> 32:31.533
-You want one?
-Thanks.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.533
Nicola Gough's booked her ticket
to Barcelona.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.661
We've had the order
to intercept.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.621
-Uh, you want one, Clem?
-Sure.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.288
-When does she leave?
-Tomorrow morning.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.623
-Sandy?
-JULES: Sandy's not thirsty.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.290
She takes the Northern Line
to London Bridge,

32:37.665 --> 32:40.834
-She had one earlier.
-Shut up.

32:38.332 --> 32:39.416
London Bridge to the airport.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.586
But she won't get there.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.090
SANDY:
Ignore them.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.426
They're just voyeurs.

32:50.094 --> 32:53.305
:
Welcome, trialists,
to the Passway facility.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.054
JULES:
Guys.

32:52.096 --> 32:56.100
Party tonight,
our dorm common room, 9:00.

32:53.347 --> 32:56.517
Please proceed to Area C
for trial induction.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.769
With special ingredients.

32:58.811 --> 33:01.063
-She means beer.
-I so do not mean beer.

33:01.105 --> 33:04.024
What if somebody finds out
that we're out after curfew?

33:03.065 --> 33:05.734
There is a journalist.
Her name is Nicola Gough.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.651
-JULES: Like who?
-Like Leo, for example.

33:05.693 --> 33:07.277
:
You scared of Leo?

33:05.776 --> 33:07.986
She is about to fly to Barcelona
to meet a source

33:07.319 --> 33:09.613
I've got Leo wrapped
around my little finger.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.446
code-named Tacitus.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.282
We've been given the order
to intercept her

33:10.906 --> 33:14.076
Will you come, Mia?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.867
before she gets to the airport.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.329
Utrax have also sent
two other trainees to Barcelona

33:14.118 --> 33:16.328
Sure. I'd like that.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.580
-Great.
-JULES: This is gonna
be so much fun, right?

33:17.371 --> 33:19.373
to intercept the source.

33:18.622 --> 33:22.000
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

33:21.583 --> 33:25.045
-When is this to happen?
-Tomorrow.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.754
Jesus, that is strong.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.339
Lucy?
Lucy Wiegler.

33:25.796 --> 33:26.964
You're supposed to have
a mixer with that.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.632
Don't you know anything?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.634
-How do you know?
-Because I do my homework

33:29.508 --> 33:31.969
Uh, you're not on the list.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.428
and watch what
they tell me to watch.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.344
Follow me at a distance.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.305
Did you apply for this trial?

33:32.469 --> 33:34.555
Unlike you.
Have you even bothered

33:34.596 --> 33:36.974
to watch this, for example?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.141
I think so.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.143
No. So you'll know nothing

33:37.182 --> 33:39.017
Do you have your consent form?

33:39.184 --> 33:41.019
about the catwalks this year.

33:42.688 --> 33:46.775
Uh, so I'll get
some mixers later.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.069
Welcome, trialists,
to the Passway facility.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.444
You want to try some?

33:49.111 --> 33:51.989
Please proceed to Area C
for trial induction.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.409
Did you see Hanna's eyes?

33:57.035 --> 33:59.955
When she broke in
the time before,

33:59.455 --> 34:01.665
It's okay.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.249
she was wild.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.584
Excuse me.
Are you doing the trial?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.375
You're safe.

34:02.291 --> 34:05.127
Like an animal or something.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.753
Maybe.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.671
This time she looked different.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.378
Who is she?

34:05.794 --> 34:08.505
If I give you this money,
will you let me take your place?

34:06.420 --> 34:08.046
Rachel and I work together.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.132
We're on the side of the angels.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.965
-Please?
-No, thanks.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.967
I didn't notice.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.633
I'm getting five times that.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.927
RACHEL:
There's just not many
of us left anymore.

34:12.009 --> 34:14.970
She just looked kind of sad.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.595
Give me your bag.
And your jacket.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.638
Take off your hoodie.

34:15.012 --> 34:18.682
Like she'd lost
everything she loved.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.766
You heard of them?
The pioneers?

34:18.807 --> 34:21.018
HANNA:
No.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.895
Shut up and drink.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.270
They were originally
a small splinter cell group

34:23.312 --> 34:25.439
of nationalist radicals
within the Agency.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.148
Go home,
and don't ever come back.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.275
RACHEL:
We used to joke about them.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.611
Then they developed Utrax.

34:30.611 --> 34:33.864
INSTRUCTOR:
Stand by! Engage!

34:32.029 --> 34:34.239
Now we believe they're about
to use Utrax

34:34.281 --> 34:36.533
to carry out a series
of assassinations

34:34.865 --> 34:36.700
Monica Gastner.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.243
across the world.

34:38.285 --> 34:40.788
I think Tacitus

34:40.829 --> 34:43.040
knows who the targets are.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.665
-GIRL: Just can't
get it on target.
-GIRL 2: Yeah, seriously...

34:43.081 --> 34:45.042
I believe he has a list
in his possession,

34:43.707 --> 34:45.250
How does the curfew work?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.169
and we need to get to him

34:45.292 --> 34:47.294
Everyone in their rooms at 9:00.

34:46.919 --> 34:49.254
-Does that hurt?

34:47.211 --> 34:49.421
before they do.

34:47.336 --> 34:50.339
-No one's allowed out of the
accommodation block after that.
-INSTRUCTOR: Engage!

34:49.296 --> 34:51.381
A little.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.342
Doors are alarmed,
camera switches off.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.009
-She's crazy.
-They should put her down.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.594
But Jules is having a party.

34:54.051 --> 34:56.762
-Don't say that.
-What? It's true.

34:55.636 --> 34:58.013
It's still
in the accommodation area.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.764
She just causes trouble.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.057
Thanks.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
For helping me.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
I'll find a way.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.312
No sweat.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.023
Leo Garner.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.650
What?

35:08.065 --> 35:10.150
You were right.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.068
It's just a funny phrase.

35:10.192 --> 35:13.070
I think I have
a friendship issue.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.070
What is?

35:13.111 --> 35:16.281
"No sweat."
Kind of 1950s.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.951
Sir, Robert Gelder has just
bought a United Airlines flight

35:16.323 --> 35:17.616
Ow!

35:16.990 --> 35:19.326
Mia. My name's Leo.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.953
to Barcelona;
he's leaving tomorrow.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.705
He paid cash at a D.C.
travel center.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.622
Be more careful next time.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.413
Hi.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.457
Can I show you your room?

35:23.747 --> 35:26.166
Thank you, Terri.
Good work.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.512
I see Clemency has been
taking you under her wing?

35:36.760 --> 35:40.430
WOMAN:
Do you have everything
you need for your stay?

35:38.554 --> 35:40.806
She's been very kind.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.559
As you know, this is
a three-night trial.

35:40.848 --> 35:43.684
Well, we all want you
to feel at home.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.936
You want me to try
talking to Mia?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.686
The first night,
you will be given the drug,

35:45.727 --> 35:48.188
and in some cases a placebo.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.438
No. Done talking.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.773
It's a little bare,
but that'll change.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.107
And you will be placed
under observation.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.776
We'll get it made up for you,
I'll get you some things,

35:50.148 --> 35:52.693
The second night
you will receive nothing,

35:52.734 --> 35:55.779
and you will be free
to hang out, play games,

35:52.818 --> 35:55.195
-make you more comfortable.
-Thank you.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.529
Leo.

35:55.237 --> 35:58.407
No problem.
And tomorrow we'll get to work

35:55.821 --> 35:56.905
get to know each other.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.825
The third night,

35:57.948 --> 35:59.366
Keep this to yourself.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.242
on building up your new life.

35:59.408 --> 36:00.993
Deal with it personally.

35:59.867 --> 36:02.578
you will receive
another treatment.

36:00.284 --> 36:02.619
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.412
I don't want any signs
she was ever there.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.746
At all times,
you will be observed,

36:02.661 --> 36:04.496
I look forward to it.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.164
and we want you to know

36:06.206 --> 36:10.002
that your safety
is our paramount concern.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.917
I'll, uh,
I'll leave you to get settled.

36:11.295 --> 36:15.465
You know, I saw you,
on the cameras.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.380
Hey, Mia.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.259
Here's the book you ordered.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.886
The break-in yesterday.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.679
Impressive.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.780
-You're such a dick, Ray.
-Hey!

36:37.237 --> 36:39.531
-What'd you get in business?
-I got an A.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.700
Come on, appreciation for
the guy who got us in here.

36:39.573 --> 36:40.741
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.117
-Really?
-What did you get?

36:41.158 --> 36:43.160
This way.

36:41.742 --> 36:42.951
Oh, whatever.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.493
-I got a B.
-Well, that's still good.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.870
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.580
Charlie, what did
you get in business?

36:46.622 --> 36:48.498
In business? I got an F.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.166
KAT:
What is that on your arm?

36:48.540 --> 36:49.958
Hey, I'll catch you guys later.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.586
Oh, uh, it's a birthmark.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.002
See you later.

36:50.334 --> 36:53.545
-Please swallow this.
-What is it?

36:52.628 --> 36:53.879
I used to try and hide it,

36:53.587 --> 36:55.589
It's just a small relaxant.
Nothing to worry about.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.881
but I don't really care
so much anymore.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.841
TERESA:
You guys want to go
inland this weekend?

36:56.506 --> 36:59.134
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.426
I will show you the real Spain.

36:59.176 --> 37:00.761
You okay?

36:59.468 --> 37:02.137
I can't, Teresa, sorry.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.679
I don't want to.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.763
You want some of this?
I can't eat it.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.472
My dad's coming to see me.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.723
Then you'll have to leave.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.222
I'm good.

37:03.513 --> 37:07.142
Oh, yeah? When?

37:07.184 --> 37:09.186
What's up?

37:07.184 --> 37:09.686
KAT:
Like, tomorrow.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.521
And I never get to see him.
He's always working, so...

37:11.229 --> 37:13.941
Clem, talk to me.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.440
What does he do?

37:13.482 --> 37:16.026
Uh, he's a lawyer
for the military.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.152
Did something happen?

37:16.068 --> 37:17.486
So cool.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.819
Okay, good.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.738
Like what?

37:17.527 --> 37:20.280
It's super secret. He doesn't
really say that much about it.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.655
We'll call you soon.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.824
No eating from now on.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.615
I don't know.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.074
SANDY:
I think it's great
that he's coming.

37:22.115 --> 37:23.784
It's not like him, though, like,

37:22.866 --> 37:25.494
Are there any other people
staying here?

37:23.617 --> 37:27.204
Something with Mia, maybe?

37:23.825 --> 37:25.661
no notice whatsoever.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.913
-People?
-Young women, staying here?

37:27.245 --> 37:30.207
Clem, you know
you can talk to me.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.539
-RAY: Excuse me.
-CLARA: Hey.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.915
This is just a trial center.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.833
-RAY: Oh, you're American?
-CLARA: Yeah.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.959
Only trialists stay here.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.460
I'm your friend.
That's what friends do.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.460
Huh. You study here?

37:33.502 --> 37:35.837
-No, just traveling.
-All right.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.339
How long you been
in Barcelona?

37:37.381 --> 37:41.009
-Two days.
-Oh, cool.

37:37.464 --> 37:41.259
She wants me to leave.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.345
CLARA:
Thanks for letting me tag along.

37:41.301 --> 37:44.096
With her.

37:43.387 --> 37:44.972
SANDY:
No worries.

37:44.137 --> 37:46.139
Leave?

37:45.013 --> 37:47.391
I love your name, by the way.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.142
-MALE NURSE: Okay.
-

37:47.432 --> 37:50.811
Clemency.
It's so unusual.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.144
How we doing?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.727
When?

37:50.852 --> 37:53.230
It was my mom's idea.

37:52.813 --> 37:55.023
Tonight.

37:54.731 --> 37:57.150
It's so beautiful here.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.776
We have a way out.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.736
Take your arm
out of your sweater.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.236
TERESA:
But the city's changing.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.612
See over there?

38:00.654 --> 38:03.573
When I was young,
that was just trees.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.242
Now all those villas
in the hills are owned

38:04.449 --> 38:06.827
Hold it like this.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.285
by Brits and Americans.

38:07.327 --> 38:12.249
Massive houses,
private pools, gardens.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.167
And most of them
sit empty all year.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.258
Your driver's on the way.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.675
Leave your belongings here,
come with me.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.802
No farewell drink?

38:21.383 --> 38:26.013
thank you, next

38:23.844 --> 38:26.054
I stopped that a while ago.

38:26.096 --> 38:28.682
Didn't do me any good.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.350
for my ex

38:29.224 --> 38:30.559
HANNA:
I'm looking for a girl.

38:30.392 --> 38:35.022
thank you, next

38:30.600 --> 38:32.561
Her name's Clara.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.061
Thanks.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.731
MALE NURSE:
I don't know her.

38:33.103 --> 38:35.147
We-we couldn't have done it
without you.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.815
-

38:35.772 --> 38:37.941
I need to find her.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.942
My pleasure.

38:36.857 --> 38:39.818
for my ex

38:37.983 --> 38:39.568
MALE NURSE:
I told you, I don't know her.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.777
Um...

38:39.609 --> 38:41.153
This way.

38:39.860 --> 38:43.030
thank you, next

38:40.819 --> 38:44.489
can I see Mia one more time?
Before I go?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.452
Why not?

38:50.829 --> 38:54.166
Alba, hi, it's Nicola.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.626
Yeah, I'm just about to go
to the airport now.

38:58.795 --> 39:03.216
Listen, Tacitus is flying today
from Washington.

39:03.258 --> 39:06.428
I need you not to say anything
to your news team, okay?

39:06.470 --> 39:07.596
Not even your editor.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.098
No e-mails. Nothing.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.061
Take a seat.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.478
Okay.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.480
Yeah.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.356
See you there.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.778
What is that?

39:22.819 --> 39:24.738
Just a screen.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.699
Why can't you tell me
where you're going?

39:24.780 --> 39:28.116
You'll be observed at all times
for your own safety.

39:27.741 --> 39:30.327
Because I don't want
to lie to you.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.952
Okay, we'll fix you up
to this line.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.537
It was so easy.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.913
And I can't tell you the truth.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.996
You'll feel a small pinch.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.539
I still think
they're gonna catch us.

39:34.581 --> 39:36.416
JULES:
Shut up, Helen.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.833
Look...

39:36.458 --> 39:38.001
-About time.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.629
I will make it up
to you, I promise.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.712
Take a seat.

39:40.670 --> 39:44.341
Yeah, you bloody well will.

39:40.754 --> 39:43.048
Everyone has to try
some of this.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.925
Who are these drugs for?

39:43.090 --> 39:45.383
It's called a screwdriver
and it's delicious.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.343
Now the music will play.

39:45.425 --> 39:46.968
Sandy lost her virginity
getting it,

39:46.384 --> 39:48.136
Just watch the image.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.762
so it was quite a sacrifice.

39:48.178 --> 39:52.307
Sit back, relax, but try
to keep your eyes open, okay?

39:48.804 --> 39:50.222
-I did not.
-You wanted to.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.307
HELEN:
Why do you always have to be
so gross, Jules?

39:52.349 --> 39:55.310
If you need assistance,
you press this emergency button.

39:52.349 --> 39:54.351
Uh, watch out.
It's pretty strong.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.354
-You understand?
-

39:57.729 --> 39:59.106
You don't like it?

40:00.148 --> 40:01.483
No, I love it.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.738
JULES:
All right, all right...

40:06.780 --> 40:08.865
-

40:08.907 --> 40:10.408
I'm not saying it's...

40:10.450 --> 40:11.993
S-Sorry, I'm...

40:15.247 --> 40:17.582
JULES:
She's here.

40:16.331 --> 40:20.293
You've had vodka before,
haven't you?

40:20.085 --> 40:23.380
-All okay?
-All good.
She's on the Northern Line.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.254
Once, at a party.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.256
A real party?

40:23.421 --> 40:25.423
Train left five minutes ago.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.424
Like, you mean,
with boys and stuff?

40:25.757 --> 40:29.177
MAN:
Please raise your hand
to indicate you're okay.

40:28.844 --> 40:31.429
It was nothing special.

40:32.472 --> 40:33.974
Did you kiss one?

40:32.556 --> 40:34.141
Okay, that's good.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.227
Just look at the trees.

40:36.852 --> 40:38.770
Yes.

40:38.812 --> 40:39.896
Oh, my God.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.649
Did you have sex with him?

40:43.817 --> 40:45.944
She's in the second
to last carriage.

40:44.568 --> 40:45.986
No.

40:45.986 --> 40:48.321
I'll fake surprise,
get her talking.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.405
I've had sex a thousand times.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.740
You do it just as the train
comes into the next station

40:48.446 --> 40:50.866
In my dreams.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.159
so it covers the sound.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.870
Then we get off,
leave her in there.

40:53.660 --> 40:57.622
LEO:
I think we underestimated
the problems she's experiencing.

40:54.786 --> 40:55.787
Mia?

40:57.664 --> 40:59.457
CARMICHAEL:
I don't get it.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.167
Is it true you were
taken away from us

40:59.499 --> 41:02.460
30 trainees, happy, smiling,

41:00.208 --> 41:02.961
when you were very young?

41:02.502 --> 41:05.463
following absolutely
every predicted pathway.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.713
Yes.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.299
And this one.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.841
Well...

41:07.340 --> 41:10.510
-LEO: Mind of her own.
-Don't be flippant.

41:07.883 --> 41:10.677
you're one of us now.

41:10.552 --> 41:14.347
Any flaw to the program this
early does none of us any good.

41:13.180 --> 41:16.099
-What?
-

41:14.389 --> 41:16.391
-So what do you suggest?
-

41:16.141 --> 41:17.309
Sorry to interrupt.

41:16.433 --> 41:18.977
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize...

41:17.350 --> 41:19.060
I just wanted
to say goodbye to Mia.

41:19.019 --> 41:21.438
I just came to see how she was.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.565
There's a car collecting me
in 30 minutes.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.981
LEO:
Terri, this is John Carmichael.

41:23.023 --> 41:24.608
We've met.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.567
Good to see you so settled.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.485
You think you can tell me
why she's failing?

41:25.609 --> 41:28.320
You seem happy, and it's nice
that you're all together.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.113
Oh, I-I don't know.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.488
I wish you all the best
for the future

41:30.155 --> 41:32.908
My hunch is that
she feels different,

41:30.530 --> 41:31.698
in your new home.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.576
Thank you.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.827
on some fundamental level.

41:34.618 --> 41:38.371
Okay. See you when I see you.

41:35.869 --> 41:37.454
Well, maybe you should
work with her,

41:37.495 --> 41:39.289
-see if you can
make some progress.
-Sure.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.290
Be careful.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.499
Because if this fails,
I have to cut her loose.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.459
The doors are alarmed
after 9:00.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.543
There's a personal
and financial cost to that.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.502
LEO:
It's all right, I've got it.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.795
One I'd like to avoid.

41:46.963 --> 41:47.923
Oh.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.175
Good job getting the booze.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.011
Face and Trigger.

41:53.053 --> 41:56.097
-Sandy was terrific.
-JULES: Oh...

41:56.139 --> 41:58.516
-He set us up!
-HELEN: Oh, thank goodness.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.894
He knew all along
we were gonna do this.

42:00.936 --> 42:03.063
Ugh. Face and fucking Trigger.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.105
HELEN:
Get over yourself, Jules.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.232
-Let's just watch the movie.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.524
JULES:
It's not as fun if they know.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.567
MAN:
If your reactions are
significant in the test cases,

42:06.566 --> 42:07.817
HELEN:
It seems like you're the one

42:07.609 --> 42:10.570
then we can explore effects
also on the Utrax recipients.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.027
wrapped around
Leo's little finger.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.948
-WOMAN: Agreed.
-MAN: We anticipate
more extreme reactions

42:12.989 --> 42:16.409
in those cases and can vary
dosage accordingly.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.869
-Your car's
waiting for you outside.
-Thank you.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.996
WOMAN:
What's the final
operational remit?

42:17.911 --> 42:20.247
Safe journey.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.957
MAN:
Removal of all inhibitions
towards the achievement

42:21.998 --> 42:23.750
of maximum violence.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.585
To be used
in extreme situations only.

42:25.627 --> 42:27.003
WOMAN:
Of course.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.967
ERIK:
And human beings are?

42:32.008 --> 42:33.510
HANNA:
Dangerous and not
to be trusted.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.970
ERIK:
If you see one?

42:35.011 --> 42:36.972
HANNA:
Come and find you.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.806
JULES:
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.599
-ERIK: If there's no time?
-Hide.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.060
-HANNA: If I can't hide...
-

42:41.142 --> 42:42.102
Engage!

42:42.102 --> 42:43.853
...attack.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.026
Excuse me, Nicola?

42:51.319 --> 42:53.405
I'm so sorry.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.284
MAN:
Evening, ma'am.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.411
Night. Larry?

42:59.452 --> 43:00.912
-Yeah?
-Carmichael wants you

43:00.954 --> 43:02.372
at the southeast perimeter.

43:02.414 --> 43:05.041
There's a problem with
the external cordon.

43:03.206 --> 43:05.625
MAN:
What the hell are you doing?!

43:05.083 --> 43:06.835
Okay.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.044
I'm on it.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.838
Thank you.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.923
MAN:
Back on the train, please;
back on the train.

43:11.214 --> 43:14.175
Let me out of here!

43:14.217 --> 43:16.594
Please let me out!

43:17.595 --> 43:20.473
MAN:
Move along, please, move along.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.646
-Stay back. No, no, no-- No!
-Stay calm.

43:25.478 --> 43:27.230
JULES:
Oh, my God, he's getting away.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.146
-HELEN: Oh!

44:08.188 --> 44:10.732
This is so awesome.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.628
Put this on, please.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.088
Is that necessary?

44:33.129 --> 44:35.423
Standard protocol, I'm afraid.

44:34.881 --> 44:38.802
on your knees

44:35.465 --> 44:38.718
Can we wait till we're
through the gates, at least?

44:38.843 --> 44:43.515
is also good for me, yeah

44:39.719 --> 44:41.679
Sure.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.099
-Thanks.
-

44:46.476 --> 44:49.229
change everything

44:49.270 --> 44:54.401
we could

44:56.611 --> 45:00.115
the way you should

45:05.495 --> 45:08.706
out there

45:08.915 --> 45:11.084
Where is the Meadows?

45:11.126 --> 45:13.503
Who are you?

45:13.545 --> 45:15.505
Tell me where they are.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.929
out there

45:29.727 --> 45:31.271
-What?
-What?

45:31.312 --> 45:35.817
give it up to me, yeah

45:34.858 --> 45:36.860
Get in.

45:35.859 --> 45:39.863
under this moon

45:40.405 --> 45:41.823
Okay.

45:41.489 --> 45:42.740
you're gonna

45:41.865 --> 45:43.074
Now we need the hood on.

45:45.452 --> 45:48.079
give it up to me

45:45.577 --> 45:46.703
What the-- Hey,

Hi.

45:46.744 --> 45:47.912
give me the...

45:48.580 --> 45:50.373

You're already here.

45:53.293 --> 45:56.087
unforgettable-ble

45:54.127 --> 45:55.962
What do you want?

45:54.586 --> 45:57.464
What? Where are they?

45:57.005 --> 45:59.007
I work here.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.009
Sandy?

45:59.591 --> 46:02.343
give it up to me

46:00.425 --> 46:01.843
Can I sit down?

46:02.302 --> 46:04.387
This way.

46:07.515 --> 46:10.435
unforgettable-ble

46:08.016 --> 46:10.018
I don't want to talk to anyone.

46:10.059 --> 46:12.645
-That's fine.
-

46:12.687 --> 46:14.898
You don't have to talk.

46:18.067 --> 46:19.903
I'll just sit here.

46:23.323 --> 46:24.282
Come on, Hanna.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.494
Oh, fuck. Come on.

46:26.284 --> 46:30.163
I just don't want you
to be alone tonight.

46:35.210 --> 46:37.212
Finally.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.634
Hello, Marissa.
