WEBVTT

00:04.975 --> 00:07.051
A freak animal killing machine
by moonlight.

00:07.227 --> 00:08.805
Werewolves are badass.

00:09.021 --> 00:12.520
We know how to bring these suckers
down. One of these right to the heart.

00:14.693 --> 00:17.528
There's something wrong with me.
Really wrong. I need help.

00:18.197 --> 00:19.739
- How much do you sleep?
- I don't.

00:19.948 --> 00:22.071
- At all?
- It's his soul. It's gone.

00:22.242 --> 00:23.274
So where is it?

00:23.452 --> 00:25.575
Still in the cage
with Michael and Lucifer.

00:25.746 --> 00:26.777
What was that thing?

00:26.955 --> 00:28.948
It may have been an Alpha.
An Alpha?

00:29.124 --> 00:32.208
The first one who spawned the others.
There's tons of lore about it.

00:32.377 --> 00:35.331
Bring me creatures.
Aim high on the food chain, please.

00:35.506 --> 00:37.379
- We ain't your employees.
- You are.

00:37.549 --> 00:41.417
- You're a punk-ass crossroads demon.
- Was a punk-ass crossroads demon.

00:41.595 --> 00:43.089
Now? King of hell.

00:43.305 --> 00:45.298
I snap my fingers,
Sam gets his soul back.

00:45.474 --> 00:48.677
Or I shove Sam right back in the hole.

00:57.653 --> 00:59.361
Did he eat?

01:00.113 --> 01:01.738
You gave him a bath, right?

01:04.075 --> 01:06.365
Well, did you take him to the park?

01:06.912 --> 01:09.320
And did he make
pee-pee and poo-poo?

01:09.957 --> 01:12.530
Good. Tell him daddy loves him.

01:12.709 --> 01:14.453
Be home soon.

01:34.439 --> 01:36.231
What the-?

02:04.261 --> 02:07.132
I know, Bobby,
but there's gotta be another way.

02:07.347 --> 02:08.925
I don't know, keep digging.

02:09.098 --> 02:12.848
- If Crowley thinks we're just gonna-
- Crowley thinks you're gonna what?

02:14.104 --> 02:16.773
That Bobby Singer?
Give him a kiss from me.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.106
- I'll call you back.
- Good news, boys.

02:21.820 --> 02:23.612
I've got a job for you.

02:25.073 --> 02:27.564
I'm gonna say this once.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.570
Take your job
and shove it up your ass.

02:30.787 --> 02:33.788
- Is that any way to talk to your boss?
- You're not my boss.

02:33.999 --> 02:36.953
Dean, Dean. Been through this.
Quit clutching your pearls.

02:37.127 --> 02:39.962
You've been working for me
for some time. Sam here, longer.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.704
- We didn't know.
- Like that makes a difference to you.

02:42.883 --> 02:46.750
You'd sell your brother for a dollar
right now if you really needed a soda.

02:49.223 --> 02:51.974
- Look, I'm sending you-
- No.

02:52.976 --> 02:54.008
Beg pardon?

02:54.186 --> 02:59.773
I've done some shady stuff in my time,
but I am not doing this. No.

02:59.983 --> 03:01.691
Ten quid says you will.

03:11.954 --> 03:14.527
You like pain, Sam? You like hell?

03:14.706 --> 03:17.328
You need to stop thinking of this
as some kind of deal.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.743
This is a hostage situation,
you arrogant thug.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.625
I own your brother.
Do you understand me?

03:31.056 --> 03:32.598
Come on, Dean, smile.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.261
It's not that bad.

03:36.436 --> 03:39.437
Here's incentive:
You bag me a live Alpha...

03:39.606 --> 03:42.856
and I'll give you little Sammy's soul
back with a cherry on top.

03:43.068 --> 03:45.524
What, Alpha Vamp
not good enough for you?

03:45.696 --> 03:49.361
Best mind where you poke your nose,
if you wanna keep it.

03:51.326 --> 03:54.861
Your merry little hike up the food chain
starts here.

03:56.081 --> 04:00.458
Businessman found dead in his car.
Chest ripped open, heart missing.

04:00.627 --> 04:02.205
- Sounds like...?
- Werewolf.

04:02.379 --> 04:03.707
No, it's not a full moon.

04:04.464 --> 04:07.916
Werewolves turning on the full moon.
So '09.

04:08.135 --> 04:09.415
He's right.

04:09.636 --> 04:12.886
Samuel and I ganked one
about six months back on a half-moon.

04:13.056 --> 04:15.215
Things have been out of whack
for a while now.

04:15.392 --> 04:17.100
Yeah, I guess.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.937
So it's settled then.

04:20.105 --> 04:23.023
You bag the howler,
bring it home to papa.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.023
See you soon, boys.

04:35.829 --> 04:37.656
So the vic's a real class act.

04:37.831 --> 04:41.911
Owned a bunch of slum-grade
apartments, a couple houses too.

04:43.003 --> 04:45.838
So this is it?
This is what you're gonna do?

04:47.799 --> 04:49.792
- What am I doing?
- Crowley.

04:49.968 --> 04:52.720
He's so far up our asses
we're coughing sulfur.

04:52.888 --> 04:55.011
But you,
you're just gonna work the case?

04:56.850 --> 04:59.341
Well, he's got us
by the short and curlies.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.346
What else are we supposed to do?

05:02.189 --> 05:06.352
It's just, you know, man,
I'm working for a demon now.

05:06.527 --> 05:09.148
I don't even know who you are. I just-

05:09.363 --> 05:11.818
I just need a second to adjust.

05:14.952 --> 05:19.863
Look, this is a crap situation,
I get it.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.282
But, Dean, I'm still me.

05:22.459 --> 05:24.452
Same melon, same memories.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.371
I still like the same music.

05:26.547 --> 05:28.919
I still think about Suzie Heizer.

05:29.091 --> 05:31.380
- Biology class Suzie Heizer?
- Can you blame me?

05:34.763 --> 05:39.472
Look, I know you don't trust me,
and I can't take back what I did.

05:39.685 --> 05:42.602
But I'm going to prove it to you.
I'm still your brother.

05:58.328 --> 06:00.736
How you doing?
Agents Holt and Wilson.

06:00.914 --> 06:02.408
- Feds?
- Yeah.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.204
What are the feds doing here?
Oh, we're specialists.

06:05.377 --> 06:09.624
They call us in to answer the questions
of mouth-breathing dick monkeys.

06:11.717 --> 06:15.501
So are you gonna
walk us through this, or...?

06:16.430 --> 06:18.755
Dockworker.
Guy on the morning shift found him.

06:18.932 --> 06:20.474
Chest ripped wide open.

06:20.642 --> 06:24.058
- Same as the body in the car?
- Yeah, second one in two days.

06:24.271 --> 06:28.020
Internal organs missing on both vics?
Like their hearts?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.479
Looks like it, yeah.

06:30.277 --> 06:33.064
- How'd you know?
- So this guy, he have any enemies?

06:34.031 --> 06:37.779
Yeah, plenty, but I don't think
it was a wolf or possibly cougar...

06:37.951 --> 06:39.991
that had a beef with the guy.

06:40.162 --> 06:42.119
You do realize
these were animal attacks.

06:42.331 --> 06:43.955
An animal out here?

06:44.124 --> 06:46.496
Well, you think it came
for the sailing?

06:59.723 --> 07:01.098
Morning.

07:02.559 --> 07:04.303
You didn't sleep...

07:05.229 --> 07:07.387
because you don't sleep.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.065
- Right.
- Yeah.

07:10.234 --> 07:12.689
- That's not creepy at all.
- Not like I can help it.

07:14.196 --> 07:17.612
You gonna just lay there staring at me
or you wanna hear what I dug up?

07:18.075 --> 07:21.526
All right. So we know that werewolves
are basically id gone wild, right?

07:21.703 --> 07:24.408
I mean, whoever they hate,
they kill when they wolf out.

07:24.623 --> 07:27.161
So I've been playing
Connect the Victims.

07:27.709 --> 07:28.741
And?

07:28.919 --> 07:31.291
And I think I found
a common denominator.

07:32.589 --> 07:34.048
So come on.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.342
Get the lead out, huh?

07:38.470 --> 07:40.795
Let me get dressed, Robocop.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.955
- Yes, can I help you?
- Is Cal Garrigan at home?

08:11.170 --> 08:13.043
We've got questions we'd like to ask.

08:13.213 --> 08:15.289
Yeah. Come in.

08:20.929 --> 08:26.054
Honey, why don't you go play
in your room for a little while, okay?

08:29.146 --> 08:30.177
Excuse the mess.

08:31.106 --> 08:32.731
Please, sit.

08:36.361 --> 08:39.611
- Can I get you guys anything?
- No, thank you.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.482
- So Cal is your boyfriend?
- That's right.

08:44.495 --> 08:47.579
- And where is he?
- Sleeping, I think.

08:47.789 --> 08:50.281
Mind telling him "up and at them"?
He's got guests.

08:50.459 --> 08:51.538
Yeah, of course.

08:54.796 --> 08:56.172
Cal.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.175
Lucky. Shh.

09:00.636 --> 09:03.802
- These are agents-
- Holt and Wilson.

09:03.972 --> 09:05.431
Morning-ish.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.925
Hey. What's this?

09:09.144 --> 09:10.888
You out late last night, Cal?

09:11.063 --> 09:13.221
Just, you know,
a couple beers with friends.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.023
- How many is a couple?
- I don't know. Three, four tops.

09:17.194 --> 09:20.479
If all you had was beer,
then how come you're sweating vodka?

09:21.573 --> 09:24.859
And it looks to me like you slept
in those clothes, am I right?

09:27.454 --> 09:28.829
I don't know, I guess.

09:29.039 --> 09:31.660
What you're saying is
you got blind drunk, blacked out.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.992
Something tells me
this isn't the first time.

09:34.169 --> 09:37.870
So, Cal, truthfully, who knows
what you've really been up to at night?

09:42.553 --> 09:43.715
Look, what's this about?

09:46.098 --> 09:48.423
We're investigating the death
of Ronald Garrigan.

09:49.309 --> 09:50.638
My brother?

09:55.023 --> 09:56.221
Sorry for your loss.

09:56.441 --> 09:58.767
I thought that was
some kind of animal attack.

09:58.986 --> 10:01.655
No love lost
between the two of you, huh?

10:01.822 --> 10:04.395
Look, we had our differences, I guess.

10:04.616 --> 10:07.950
You love your brother, of course,
but Ron had a lot of problems.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.037
He was volatile.

10:11.874 --> 10:14.709
Last time he was here,
you called the cops.

10:17.921 --> 10:21.789
Yeah. Look, he came in here
all messed up, and he was yelling.

10:21.967 --> 10:25.301
He shoved Mandy so I called the cops.
I don't see how that has to do-

10:25.471 --> 10:28.471
Your landlord was found dead this week,
were you aware of that?

10:30.601 --> 10:32.392
Saw it in the papers, why?

10:32.603 --> 10:35.307
Well, you two are pretty far behind
on your rent, right?

10:35.522 --> 10:37.847
He had sent eviction papers?

10:39.193 --> 10:41.684
I'm sorry, that was an animal attack.

10:42.362 --> 10:44.320
Funny enough, yeah,
both of them were.

10:44.531 --> 10:46.025
So great, great. Yeah, guys.

10:46.241 --> 10:49.112
What in the hell do you think
I had to do with them?

10:49.328 --> 10:52.827
Just following procedure. Had to ask.

10:53.499 --> 10:54.744
You two have a good day.

11:01.924 --> 11:03.501
So Cal's a prince.

11:03.675 --> 11:05.549
He doesn't know
where he was last night.

11:05.761 --> 11:09.711
- Bag him now?
- No, we make sure.

11:09.890 --> 11:10.921
Really?

11:11.099 --> 11:14.883
Before we hand him over to a lifetime
of demon rape? Yeah, really.

11:51.056 --> 11:53.345
Boy, Cal just doesn't know
when to quit.

11:53.517 --> 11:55.640
Three scuzzy bars,
one scuzzy strip club...

11:55.811 --> 11:58.812
a chili dog joint,
seven or eight nightcaps...

11:58.981 --> 12:01.388
and now Scotches in the library.

12:03.819 --> 12:06.571
I'm getting cirrhosis
just watching this.

12:07.239 --> 12:09.481
Other than that, we got squat.

12:10.742 --> 12:11.905
Let's just see.

12:26.091 --> 12:27.170
Dude, sun's up.

12:27.926 --> 12:30.085
This guy's still on two legs,
in theory.

12:31.180 --> 12:32.555
He ain't wolfing out.

12:32.723 --> 12:35.724
Well, not tonight, anyway.

12:36.852 --> 12:40.600
Let's head back.
We can re-attack this in a couple hours.

13:02.002 --> 13:03.829
Catch you later, man.

13:20.270 --> 13:21.895
Lucky.

13:22.689 --> 13:24.516
What are you doing?

14:32.520 --> 14:34.762
Ohh. Ooh.

14:35.315 --> 14:36.975
Lucky, that's enough.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.358
Cal?

14:48.495 --> 14:50.203
Typical.

14:54.417 --> 14:55.662
Oh, Lucky.

14:56.503 --> 15:01.330
Honestly, you are the only
decent boyfriend I have ever had.

15:04.344 --> 15:06.004
Okay.

15:38.712 --> 15:41.416
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say that it's not Cal.

15:41.589 --> 15:44.163
Masterful deduction, Sherlock.

15:44.342 --> 15:48.007
I mean, a werewolf attack in daylight?
This whole thing is just weird.

15:48.179 --> 15:50.505
Dogs and cats living together,
mass hysteria.

15:50.682 --> 15:53.885
So you know this means
that we're down to one suspect, right?

15:55.270 --> 15:56.432
I know.

15:56.604 --> 15:59.558
I mean, Mandy is right at the deep end
of the vic pool.

15:59.733 --> 16:01.357
Can you do it?

16:02.402 --> 16:03.517
Do what?

16:03.695 --> 16:06.186
Shove her in the trunk,
serve her up to Crowley.

16:09.617 --> 16:11.325
Yeah, Sam. I can do it.

16:16.207 --> 16:17.702
Hey.

16:19.335 --> 16:22.087
You still feeling hot, baby?
Here, have some juice.

16:22.297 --> 16:24.373
- It'll make you feel better.
- Okay.

16:24.966 --> 16:26.341
Hey. See?

16:26.509 --> 16:30.044
Lucky knows you're not feeling well
and he wants you to feel better.

16:30.722 --> 16:32.964
He loves you, doesn't he?

16:34.726 --> 16:37.395
There's a good boy.
There's a good boy.

16:37.562 --> 16:39.389
You wanna squeak? Yeah.

16:41.274 --> 16:43.148
Uh-oh!

16:43.318 --> 16:46.023
- It broke off.
- Lucky, look what you did.

16:46.237 --> 16:48.775
<i>Next up on the Buffalo noon day news:</i>

16:48.948 --> 16:51.522
<i>We'll talk to animal control
about the recent attacks.</i>

16:51.701 --> 16:53.658
<i>But first, weather.</i>

16:53.828 --> 16:57.612
What, am I interrupting the morning
show? Come on, let's go for a walk.

16:59.626 --> 17:01.453
Hey, is that blood?

17:02.003 --> 17:04.042
Have you killed a bird again?

17:04.214 --> 17:05.624
Bad dog.

17:12.513 --> 17:14.471
- Okay.
- See you then.

17:14.641 --> 17:16.468
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:16.643 --> 17:18.766
Ma'am. Agents.

17:18.978 --> 17:21.185
What are you doing here?

17:21.356 --> 17:22.767
Nobody called you?

17:22.982 --> 17:25.189
Called me about what?

17:27.862 --> 17:31.942
I'm sorry, I just can't believe it.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.193
I'm really very sorry.

17:34.369 --> 17:38.782
Ma'am, I know this isn't the best time,
but we'd like you to come with us.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.499
Why?

17:40.667 --> 17:43.205
You think I have something
to do with this? With Cal?

17:43.378 --> 17:45.584
Of course not.
Just got a few questions.

17:45.797 --> 17:47.375
I's and T's, mostly.

17:48.383 --> 17:50.007
I...

17:50.593 --> 17:52.633
Could we do it later?

17:52.846 --> 17:54.091
I'm afraid not.

17:57.976 --> 17:59.256
Oh.

18:00.061 --> 18:02.848
My kid has the flu.

18:03.022 --> 18:04.398
And he was up all night.

18:04.566 --> 18:07.235
Is there a neighbor who can watch him
while you're gone?

18:09.863 --> 18:11.654
I'm sorry. Your boy was up all night?

18:11.823 --> 18:14.492
- Yeah.
- And were you with him all night?

18:15.368 --> 18:16.779
Um...

18:17.454 --> 18:21.582
Well, I had half an hour of sleep,
maybe?

18:21.750 --> 18:23.576
- Can I talk to your son?
- Why?

18:24.127 --> 18:26.796
Yeah, what difference does that make,
Agent Holt?

18:26.963 --> 18:28.920
Trust me. It's important.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.207
Please?

18:33.511 --> 18:35.421
Well, it wasn't her.

18:35.597 --> 18:36.759
You don't know that.

18:36.931 --> 18:38.889
- She's got an alibi.
- She's lying.

18:39.059 --> 18:42.677
- You heard the kid. She's not lying.
- Fine. She still had time to wolf out.

18:42.854 --> 18:45.641
Last werewolf was in bed with me,
and she wolfed out.

18:45.815 --> 18:47.475
Don't make this personal.

18:47.650 --> 18:49.892
Look, between this
and the daylight attacks...

18:50.070 --> 18:51.480
something's not adding up.

18:51.654 --> 18:55.320
I'm not gonna hand her over to Crowley
until we figure out what, understand?

18:56.951 --> 18:59.277
Okay, okay. I understand.

18:59.996 --> 19:02.831
You check Cal's crime scene,
see if we're missing anything.

19:02.999 --> 19:05.039
I'll come back
and keep an eye on Amanda.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.535
How about you go and I'll stay here?

19:08.380 --> 19:11.001
Dean, I still know how to do my job.

19:12.092 --> 19:14.168
I'm just gonna watch her, that's all.

19:14.344 --> 19:15.921
Trust me.

19:16.763 --> 19:18.305
Uh-huh.

22:20.113 --> 22:22.271
It's gonna be okay, boy.

22:22.449 --> 22:25.450
We gotta find a vet.
Hurry, hurry.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.698
Hey!

22:28.872 --> 22:33.083
Wait, wait, wait, mister.
Hey, mister, wait. That's my dog.

22:34.044 --> 22:35.917
It's my dog.

23:04.650 --> 23:07.686
<i>Hey. Hey, it's me.</i>

23:07.862 --> 23:09.522
Well, I got bupkis here.

23:09.738 --> 23:12.443
I definitely got something.
It ain't a werewolf, for one.

23:12.616 --> 23:14.443
<i>- Yeah? What is it?
- Skinwalker.</i>

23:15.327 --> 23:17.154
A skinwalker? As in-?

23:17.371 --> 23:20.325
As in, the family dog
seriously needs a neuter.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.994
Wow.

23:22.167 --> 23:25.702
Haven't heard of a skinwalker in years.
I'm a little rusty on the profile.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.999
<i>You and me both.
I just got the lowdown from Bobby.</i>

23:29.216 --> 23:32.965
They can change anywhere, any time.
Skinwalkers infect you with a single bite.

23:33.137 --> 23:36.470
Otherwise, they're basically
a werewolf cousin. Silver will drop them.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.966
- They chow hearts like Snausages.
- You catch him?

23:39.143 --> 23:42.144
Not exactly,
but I have some idea where he might be.

23:52.656 --> 23:54.067
Hi, Lucky.

23:55.492 --> 23:56.572
Bad dog.

23:59.663 --> 24:01.786
First things first.

24:04.585 --> 24:07.123
See this? This is silver.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.788
Don't say I didn't warn you.

24:12.968 --> 24:14.297
Okay, time to go.

24:15.554 --> 24:19.469
Now, we can either do this
the easy way...

24:23.062 --> 24:24.093
or the hard way.

24:27.191 --> 24:29.978
What? Soul or not, that's funny.

24:32.029 --> 24:36.109
Well, I gotta tell you, Lucky,
you got us stumped.

24:36.492 --> 24:41.533
I mean, why shack up with a family?
Is it a kinky thing?

24:44.542 --> 24:46.783
Do you like to play with your food?

24:47.503 --> 24:49.579
Roll over, Lucky. Speak.

24:50.214 --> 24:53.131
- Go to hell.
- Already been, didn't agree with me.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.965
So look,
how about I take this silver knife...

24:57.179 --> 24:59.931
and I start carving some dog
until you behave?

25:00.975 --> 25:02.350
You do what you gotta do.

25:03.811 --> 25:05.186
Hang on, Sam.

25:08.357 --> 25:11.856
Listen, you don't have to tell me
why you're with the family, I get it.

25:12.611 --> 25:13.774
Oh, you do, do you?

25:13.988 --> 25:16.858
You killed every threat
that came near them.

25:17.533 --> 25:21.994
You care about them, in your own
whack-a-doodle kind of way.

25:22.162 --> 25:23.242
It's obvious.

25:25.165 --> 25:29.709
What I wanna know is, who was
that guy you were kibitzing with?

25:29.879 --> 25:31.207
He a skinwalker too?

25:37.720 --> 25:39.048
Look, I can't say anything.

25:39.263 --> 25:41.836
But if you don't,
then you're gonna put the girl...

25:42.057 --> 25:43.884
and the little boy in danger.

25:44.476 --> 25:47.810
And sooner or later,
all this crap is gonna come for them.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.735
Now, look,
we don't give a rat's ass about you.

25:55.529 --> 25:59.527
We wanna help them.
That's our angle, that's it.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.159
Yeah, that guy, he's a-

26:10.377 --> 26:12.335
Whatever it is I am.

26:12.504 --> 26:13.584
He's not the only one.

26:14.757 --> 26:17.129
- How many are you?
- About 30.

26:17.301 --> 26:20.385
We were all-
We were kind of recruited.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.508
Recruited?

26:24.683 --> 26:27.388
Yeah. Me, I was living on the streets.

26:27.561 --> 26:30.895
They found me, they told me
one small bite I'd be strong, I'd be fast.

26:31.106 --> 26:33.348
Sniffing people's butts,
that's a real step up.

26:33.984 --> 26:36.143
Well, it was for me.

26:36.779 --> 26:40.148
Where is this little Scooby gang
of yours?

26:40.324 --> 26:42.198
They're everywhere.

26:42.743 --> 26:46.788
We're out there finding families,
and once they take us in, we lay low.

26:46.956 --> 26:48.616
Lay low? What the hell's that mean?

26:48.791 --> 26:51.994
- Well, we're waiting for the word.
- What word?

26:53.087 --> 26:58.674
Once we're settled, we get the signal
and we all turn on our families.

27:00.469 --> 27:05.629
We change them, all in one night.
Thirty becomes 150.

27:05.808 --> 27:08.346
God, you're a sleeper cell.

27:09.103 --> 27:10.894
Yeah, well, that's one way to say it.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.186
So you're waiting for word from who?

27:13.399 --> 27:15.605
Who organized you?

27:16.944 --> 27:19.186
- There's a pack leader.
- Your Alpha?

27:19.405 --> 27:20.519
What's an Alpha?

27:20.739 --> 27:23.028
The first skinwalker, the strongest.

27:23.242 --> 27:26.326
Well, he's plenty strong,
but no, I don't think so.

27:26.495 --> 27:30.742
There's guys like him in other towns.
We're not the only pack out there.

27:30.958 --> 27:33.627
Fantastic.
Then you can help us stop him.

27:33.836 --> 27:35.378
Oh, no, I can't. No.

27:35.546 --> 27:38.666
- Yes, you can.
- No, you guys don't get it.

27:38.883 --> 27:41.504
No one can. These guys who
turned me, they're ruthless.

27:48.225 --> 27:49.767
Sam, not helping.

27:49.977 --> 27:51.602
Fetch this, dick.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.895
Listen to me.

27:54.565 --> 27:56.771
What are you gonna do
to that family, really?

27:58.068 --> 28:01.022
You gonna put your jaws
around that little boy's throat?

28:01.238 --> 28:04.358
Clamp down?
Listen to him cry for his mom?

28:06.535 --> 28:09.655
Because I'm gonna guess
that these are the only people...

28:10.247 --> 28:14.292
who, in your pathetic life,
have ever showed you any kindness.

28:16.045 --> 28:19.994
So it's either that
or you can help us stop it.

28:23.636 --> 28:27.254
So how are we supposed to
get near something that can smell us...

28:27.431 --> 28:29.305
a hundred yards off?

28:29.475 --> 28:30.589
We don't.

28:33.562 --> 28:36.349
The pack leader.
We're taking him down?

28:37.233 --> 28:41.147
- Yeah, you got a better idea?
- No, I-

28:42.071 --> 28:43.695
Crowley's not gonna be too happy.

28:43.906 --> 28:45.151
Who gives a rat's ass?

28:46.742 --> 28:49.067
We let that thing live one second...

28:49.245 --> 28:51.652
and it sends out
that psychic dog whistle and:

28:52.456 --> 28:54.828
On the other hand,
it could lead us to an Alpha...

28:55.000 --> 28:57.040
then Crowley would give me
my soul back.

28:57.253 --> 29:00.456
Are you kidding? A hundred and fifty
people turned into monsters.

29:00.631 --> 29:04.379
- That's what you want?
- No, of course not.

29:04.927 --> 29:06.754
I'm just asking.

29:08.097 --> 29:09.295
You know what? That's it.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.638
- What?
- You say you're just folks, huh?

29:11.809 --> 29:14.929
That you like baseball
and apple pie or whatever.

29:15.104 --> 29:18.722
The truth is, I don't know what you are,
because you're not Sam.

29:18.899 --> 29:19.930
Dean, come on.

29:20.150 --> 29:23.187
It's your gigantor body
and maybe your brain, but it's not you.

29:23.362 --> 29:28.071
So just stop pretending.
It'd do us both a favor.

30:04.111 --> 30:06.151
He looks nervous, right?

30:07.990 --> 30:10.777
- Wouldn't you be?
- I'd double-cross us.

30:10.993 --> 30:14.943
He's gotta realize that's his best bet
if he wants to keep breathing.

30:15.164 --> 30:17.370
No, he'll go through with it.

30:17.541 --> 30:20.079
- You mean because he loves that family?
- Yeah.

30:23.714 --> 30:24.877
I'd double-cross us.

30:27.676 --> 30:29.669
Thanks, Dexter, that's reassuring.

30:31.222 --> 30:33.463
I was just making conversation.

30:38.896 --> 30:40.520
Here we go.

31:05.881 --> 31:10.175
The big guy, the driver.
That's the guy Lucky met in the park.

31:12.721 --> 31:14.264
<i>And there's el jefe.</i>

31:14.473 --> 31:16.715
- Take him out.
- It's not clean.

31:17.434 --> 31:19.925
And we got one shot at this, literally.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.541
- Take the shot.
- I'm trying.

31:46.755 --> 31:49.044
- She's in the way.
- Take it anyway.

31:57.183 --> 31:58.890
Come on, come on.

32:05.316 --> 32:07.889
- So plan B?
- We've got one?

32:18.541 --> 32:24.460
Please, whatever you want,
just please let my son go.

32:34.724 --> 32:37.559
Look, man, there's nothing I can do.
The boss, he's pissed.

32:38.644 --> 32:43.022
These murders that you've been doing,
you didn't ask for permission.

32:43.232 --> 32:45.059
You're gonna screw up
the whole plan.

32:45.276 --> 32:47.482
- I tried to warn you.
- I know, I'm sorry.

32:47.695 --> 32:50.530
There's been a mistake.
This has got nothing to do with us.

32:50.740 --> 32:53.990
It has everything to do with you,
sister.

32:55.453 --> 32:58.619
- So are you with us or not?
- Yes, of course I am.

32:59.081 --> 33:01.288
Fine, prove it.

33:01.500 --> 33:06.839
Turn them, now.
Both of them, while we watch.

33:07.048 --> 33:09.420
- Or I'll kill you all.
- Oh, my God.

33:12.595 --> 33:14.054
What is that?

33:30.655 --> 33:32.896
- Mommy.
- It's okay.

33:34.951 --> 33:38.236
- Mandy, come on. Come with me.
- Who are you? I don't even know you.

33:38.454 --> 33:40.945
Yes, you do.
Trust me, I'm trying to help. Come on.

33:46.170 --> 33:47.795
Hey.

34:01.894 --> 34:03.305
- Get in.
- But I don't-

34:04.480 --> 34:05.725
Bolt it. Bolt it.

34:11.070 --> 34:12.185
Here, baby, go in here.

34:13.197 --> 34:15.771
Okay, stay there, honey,
you'll be safe.

35:03.206 --> 35:05.412
You're protecting them?

35:06.000 --> 35:09.832
After what I did for you?
I gave you your life back.

35:11.422 --> 35:13.000
But them?

35:13.799 --> 35:15.839
You're nothing to them.

35:16.219 --> 35:18.258
You're a dog.

35:24.977 --> 35:27.978
I was gonna turn them,
but now I'm gonna kill them.

35:52.296 --> 35:53.494
Lucky?

35:54.882 --> 35:57.836
So you think
this is gonna be a dog fight?

35:58.052 --> 36:00.175
I got a better idea.

36:06.435 --> 36:08.724
Silver bullet, Lucky.

37:23.553 --> 37:24.716
Hi.

37:28.308 --> 37:31.428
I'm not here to bother you, I just...

37:31.603 --> 37:32.978
I just wanna say one thing.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.358
You and Aiden,
you're the only family I ever had...

37:38.526 --> 37:40.069
and I know that sounds-

37:40.236 --> 37:41.814
I know...

37:45.951 --> 37:49.366
I know what I am, it-

37:49.955 --> 37:52.659
It's just that no one's ever been
so nice to me before.

37:55.961 --> 37:58.665
So-So thank you.

37:59.756 --> 38:02.959
Get away from this house,
you psycho.

38:03.927 --> 38:10.641
And if you ever, ever come near me
or my son again, so help me...

38:11.601 --> 38:13.808
I know I probably deserve-

38:46.177 --> 38:48.466
I'll never look at a dog the same.

38:49.014 --> 38:52.548
- Makes you wonder though, huh?
- What?

38:52.726 --> 38:55.014
How many packs are out there.

38:55.186 --> 38:58.935
What if they're all just waiting
for the signal, you know?

39:00.817 --> 39:04.945
So I was thinking, you were right.

39:05.113 --> 39:09.526
- About?
- I'm not your brother. I'm not Sam.

39:11.036 --> 39:12.411
Okay.

39:12.579 --> 39:15.948
All that "blah, blah, blah"
about being the old me?

39:16.124 --> 39:17.867
Crap.

39:18.043 --> 39:23.879
Like Lisa and Ben, right?
I've been acting like I care about them.

39:25.216 --> 39:27.790
But I don't. I couldn't care less.

39:28.511 --> 39:30.385
Is this supposed
to make me feel better?

39:30.597 --> 39:33.467
You wanted the real me, this is it.
I don't care about them.

39:33.642 --> 39:38.980
I don't even really care about you,
except that I need your help.

39:39.564 --> 39:42.020
You're clearly not gonna stick around
for longer...

39:42.192 --> 39:45.146
unless I give it to you straight, so...

39:46.738 --> 39:48.481
I've done a lot worse than you know.

39:48.698 --> 39:52.233
I've killed innocent people
in the line of duty...

39:52.410 --> 39:56.906
but I'm pretty sure it's not something
the old me could have done.

39:58.416 --> 40:02.995
And maybe I should feel guilty,
but I don't.

40:03.171 --> 40:05.329
Sam, get to the punch line.

40:07.342 --> 40:13.760
Look, I don't know
if how I am is better or worse.

40:13.932 --> 40:15.260
It's different.

40:15.433 --> 40:17.889
You get the job done
and nothing really hurts.

40:18.603 --> 40:20.596
That's not the worst thing.

40:21.398 --> 40:24.897
But I've been thinking.

40:25.819 --> 40:30.944
I was that other Sam for a long time,
and it was...

40:32.659 --> 40:34.652
It was kind of harder.

40:35.996 --> 40:38.569
But there are also things
about it I remember that...

40:42.252 --> 40:45.870
Let's just say, I think
I should probably go back to being him.

40:52.846 --> 40:57.009
That's very interesting. It's a step.

40:59.728 --> 41:00.842
So?

41:08.028 --> 41:09.356
We do what we gotta do...

41:12.115 --> 41:13.989
and we get my brother back.
