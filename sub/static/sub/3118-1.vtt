<i>I'm gonna... I'm
gonna fucking piss my pants.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:40.239
<i>Hey,
if you wanna watch this video,</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:43.142
<i>please go to our website
NotSeeParty.com.</i>

00:43.144 --> 00:44.243
N-O-T...

00:44.245 --> 00:45.344
S-E-E...

00:45.346 --> 00:46.645
And not "Nazi" with a "Z."

00:46.647 --> 00:48.380
That'd be like cross-dressing

00:48.382 --> 00:50.416
Adolf Eichmann-Liza Minnelli
impersonator.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.085
If I... If I die of laughter
during this segment,

00:53.087 --> 00:54.420
I don't want you to feel bad.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.888
I want you all to know
that I died happy,

00:55.890 --> 00:59.224
because this video is
the greatest thing that's ever
happened to me.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.659
It's up to like
30 something million.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.161
Here we... Here we go.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.737
Shit!

01:47.107 --> 01:48.440
I'm gonna talk to this kid
about everything.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.076
I wanna know...
I wanna know
what he masturbates to,

01:51.078 --> 01:53.979
I wanna know
if he kept the leg.
Did he keep the leg?

01:53.981 --> 01:55.481
I gotta say though, man.
I've watched
this video enough.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.082
I'm starting to feel bad
for the kid.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.451
I'm not laughed out yet
but I'm feeling bad for him.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.788
Feeling bad?
The kid's got tons of hits
'cause he's famous.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.957
Right? I mean what more
do you want? He's got
more hits than I do.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.226
I'm kinda in a
weird way, jealous.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.926
I don't need both legs.
What am I?
I'm not running marathons.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.294
So look out,
you crazy Canucks.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.431
Something weird-ass
this way comes.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.766
Next week, Wanderin' Wallace
takes a raunchy road trip

02:14.768 --> 02:17.503
up to the Great White North
to meet with a star.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.605
My only hope is that
he doesn't cry too much.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.907
Join us next week while
Wallace sits down

02:21.909 --> 02:25.844
with the one-legged wonder,
the master of self-mutilation

02:25.846 --> 02:28.480
of Internet humiliation,
the Kill Bill Kid.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.149
Which is about all you can do
if you're the Kill Bill Kid.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.351
You just sit your
one-legged ass down,

02:32.353 --> 02:33.485
- forever.
- Aw.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.020
Oh, it's too easy.
It was right there!

02:35.022 --> 02:37.589
-You're going to hell, man.
-They're like plums,
like low-hanging plums.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.657
I had to grab it.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.159
Until next time,
I'm Teddy Craft.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.494
And this is Wallace Bryton
reminding you to...

02:42.496 --> 02:45.797
Join ze Not-See Party!

02:58.846 --> 02:59.945
Welcome to Canada.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.413
Oh!

03:03.283 --> 03:04.683
Hey, there.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.619
Hey there, yourself,
fellow facial hair aficionado.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.855
Yeah, not as good as you.
My God!

03:09.857 --> 03:14.526
- Yeah, years back. Now it's...
- Los Angeles.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.496
A man torn betwixt
Devils and Kings.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.967
Oh! Hockey.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.669
You're damn right, hockey.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.004
Hmm. I don't really
follow hockey.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.640
Okay.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.309
Hands off the counter, please.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.577
Really?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.811
Yeah, really. Thank you.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.346
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.514
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.182
Sorry.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.585
When you're visiting the Great
White North of Canada,

03:39.587 --> 03:42.821
you got your Cana-Do's and
you got your Cana-Don'ts.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.723
Top shelf, right there.
Number one.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.825
Don't go tell any Canadian
you don't follow hockey.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.493
Of course!

03:48.495 --> 03:49.928
I should've known that.
It makes 'em sad, right?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.863
A Canadian doesn't get sad.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.699
Sadness was made by the USA.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.167
Oh, come on.
What does that mean?

03:55.169 --> 03:58.270
Take off, it's true.
Right there on our flag.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.538
It's right there
when you look at it.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.373
When you see past that
sacred Maple Leaf,

04:01.375 --> 04:02.507
you know what you see?

04:02.509 --> 04:03.575
A white wall.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.711
You see that in America,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.713
you may be red,
white and blue.

04:07.715 --> 04:12.217
But in Canada, you're red,
white but never blue, eh?

04:12.219 --> 04:13.118
Ever.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.020
Got you.
That's actually...

04:15.022 --> 04:16.421
You know, I've never thought
of it that way before.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.523
I always think of Canadians
as just nice.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.625
Well, that right there
is another Cana-Don't.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.427
We're not nice,
we're optimistic.
There is a difference.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.196
- Right.
- And we're tolerant.

04:24.198 --> 04:26.865
- Hmm.
- And we're hung like moose.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.200
Oh!

04:32.138 --> 04:33.505
That's great.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.310
Back to business, then.
What're you doing in Manitoba?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.812
Um,
I'm recording a podcast.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.115
So what I do is, I, uh...

04:43.117 --> 04:47.552
I travel around and
I interview weird
or interesting people

04:47.554 --> 04:49.221
and I describe it
to my best friend

04:49.223 --> 04:51.990
who does not see it first-hand

04:51.992 --> 04:53.792
since he won't fly anywhere.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.227
It's called The Not-See Party.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.229
Whoa, whoa! Nazi Party?

04:57.231 --> 05:00.399
Oh, no.
It's spelled N-O-T-S-E-E,

05:00.401 --> 05:03.068
not the other... Hatey one.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.670
You know, that Hitler.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.632
You don't say Hitler
in an airport.

05:17.684 --> 05:18.850
All right.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.371
What the fuck is this?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.431
Hey!

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
Oh, shit!

06:19.312 --> 06:21.012
Oh, fuck!

06:28.688 --> 06:32.023
Hey, fucker.
Are you ready for this?

06:32.025 --> 06:36.728
Fucking Kill Bill Kid fucking
killed himself, sir!

06:36.730 --> 06:39.331
With his own fucking sword!
Can you believe that shit?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.933
I'm not fucking kidding you.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.435
He couldn't hold out
for two more days,

06:43.437 --> 06:46.037
the selfish little peg-legged
piece of shit.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.573
I'm so pissed off right now.
I gotta find a flight
back tonight.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.442
But I'm thinking I don't
wanna come all the way
back with nothing.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.544
We need a show
this week, so...

06:52.546 --> 06:56.882
I'm in fucking Winnipeg
in a bar called, uh...

06:56.884 --> 06:59.217
Bar "H."

06:59.219 --> 07:01.253
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do. I'm gonna...

07:01.255 --> 07:05.090
Try to find some other
Canadian weirdo up here
I can talk to, but...

07:05.092 --> 07:06.625
I gotta be honest, man.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.294
There is nothing weird
about Canada.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.697
It is painfully
boring up here.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.868
But shit! $550 for
a fucking plane ticket.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.937
Selfish little prick.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.138
I know it's fucked up
to say, but...

07:20.140 --> 07:22.707
God damn it!
It was killing me.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.342
All right.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.379
Signing off from
the Great White North.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.915
<i>¶ Coo loo coo coo,
coo coo coo</i>

07:29.917 --> 07:31.583
<i>¶ Coo loo coo coo</i>

07:31.585 --> 07:33.118
Oh, shit. Beep.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.801
Hey, man,
where is your bathroom?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.512
<i>Hello, I am an old man</i>

08:00.514 --> 08:03.815
<i>who has enjoyed a long
and storied life at sea.</i>

08:03.817 --> 08:06.818
<i>I am a proud Canadian who has
traveled a peculiar path</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:08.954
<i>lo these many years.</i>

08:08.956 --> 08:11.490
<i>And after eons of
oceanic adventure,</i>

08:11.492 --> 08:14.192
<i>I find myself a landlubber,</i>

08:14.194 --> 08:17.095
<i>with Manitoba as
my final port.</i>

08:17.097 --> 08:20.465
<i>I know I do not wish to spend
my remaining years alone</i>

08:20.467 --> 08:22.267
<i>in a giant house.</i>

08:22.269 --> 08:24.309
<i>Not when I have
such stories to share.</i>

08:29.008 --> 08:31.009
No, it's not the room
I'm interested in

08:31.011 --> 08:32.844
as much as you, Mr. Howe.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.479
Yeah, tonight would be...

08:34.481 --> 08:36.381
That'd be amazing, sir.
Yes, thank you.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.450
All right, where am I going?

08:38.452 --> 08:42.287
Bifrost? Sounds erotic.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.121
Okay, let me just ask
somebody how far I am.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.825
Excuse me, hey!

08:46.827 --> 08:48.460
Uh, how far is
Bifrost from here?

08:48.462 --> 08:50.829
Bifrost?
Shit! That's far.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.464
Yeah, it's about two hours
from here.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.466
Yeah, the kids here at
the convenience store

08:54.468 --> 08:56.668
are telling me that
it's "aboot"
two hours away.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.703
I hate American guys.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.171
<i>Yeah,
what's your address?</i>

09:00.173 --> 09:02.908
<i>So to this end,
I'm offering a room for rent</i>

09:02.910 --> 09:04.910
<i>in my stately woodland home.</i>

09:04.912 --> 09:07.345
<i>This arrangement will be
free of charge,</i>

09:07.347 --> 09:09.981
<i>providing you perform
the simple household chores</i>

09:09.983 --> 09:11.917
<i>I can no longer tend to</i>

09:11.919 --> 09:14.719
<i>from the confines of
this cursed wheelchair.</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:18.690
<i>But though I may be old,
I have lived.</i>

09:18.692 --> 09:21.026
<i>And I will tell you all about
my many adventures,</i>

09:21.028 --> 09:23.728
<i>in vivid detail.</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:27.265
<i>Please feel free to call me
at the number below.</i>

09:27.267 --> 09:30.769
<i>Respectfully, Howard Howe.</i>

09:36.175 --> 09:39.010
All right. This better be
fucking worth it.

09:47.186 --> 09:50.121
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

10:53.285 --> 10:55.320
Hello? Hello?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.822
Hello!
Up here, please.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.596
Hello?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.366
Good evening!

11:08.368 --> 11:09.634
Mr. Howe?

11:09.636 --> 11:11.236
Well actually, it's Howard.

11:11.937 --> 11:14.606
Mr. Howard, hey!

11:14.608 --> 11:18.109
You know, when people first
become entangled with my name,

11:18.111 --> 11:20.979
it's much like a
French bedroom farce.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.683
Now, Mr. Howe would be
appropriate,

11:24.685 --> 11:27.686
but I prefer the intimacy
of Howard.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.120
Howard.

11:29.122 --> 11:32.290
Now that we have that
unpleasantness out of the way,

11:32.292 --> 11:35.026
may I welcome you
to Pippy Hill, my home.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.328
Oh, yes. It's great.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.365
- It's nice to meet you.
- Pleasure. Pleasure.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.500
Could I interest you
in some tea?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.969
You can. But first, uh...

11:44.971 --> 11:46.504
Can I use your bathroom?

11:46.506 --> 11:47.939
Smashing.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.150
Phew!

12:00.586 --> 12:01.920
Hoo-ah!

12:07.827 --> 12:10.028
Oh, Jesus!

12:26.378 --> 12:27.378
Whoo!

12:33.953 --> 12:35.854
Well, did everything
come out all right?

12:35.856 --> 12:38.123
Oh, yeah. Great.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.858
Thank you.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.526
You're welcome,
there's your tea.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.261
All right. Thank you.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.197
You know, my second wife...

12:46.199 --> 12:47.966
I presume my last...

12:49.235 --> 12:51.870
Used to say,
bless her heart.

12:51.872 --> 12:55.039
"Rather saint than sin,
Better out than in."

12:55.041 --> 12:58.810
She was referring to gas,
of course! Her own, mind you.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.981
That's great.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.916
This... Thank you.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.984
You bet.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.423
God damn,
this is good.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.429
So did you find
the water closet satisfactory?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.098
Oh, yes. Thank you so much.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.600
That was great!

13:22.602 --> 13:25.570
I was holding it in
for half the ride.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.072
It's a little embarrassing
but, um...

13:28.074 --> 13:30.642
I was kinda spooked
to get out of the car
in the middle of nowhere.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.011
...You know.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.413
I must say

13:35.415 --> 13:38.349
your phone call
intrigued me.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.419
Well, I'm telling you,
your handbill intrigued me.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.426
Did I understand you
correctly on the phone

13:48.428 --> 13:50.261
when you said
you weren't looking for
a living arrangement?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.362
Mmm-mmm.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.298
No, I live in Los Angeles.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.833
- Oh?
- Yeah.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.168
City of Angels.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.537
Well, I've never seen
any myself.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.673
More the opposite, really.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.008
My grandma, Mimsy,
used to tell us,

14:04.010 --> 14:07.245
"You needn't go very far to
find hell in a hand basket."

14:09.315 --> 14:11.883
I like that. I like Mimsy.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.118
Oh, my grandma...
My grandma used to say...

14:14.120 --> 14:17.288
She'd say,
"Hell is your children."

14:17.290 --> 14:19.824
Chain smoker,
"Hell is your children."
She was the worst.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.326
How droll.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.494
She must've been
an interesting woman.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.029
Oh, now, she was flatulent.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.332
Oh, let me tell you,
it was cra...

14:27.334 --> 14:30.068
I've never seen
anything like it or
smelled anything like it.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.637
She would hang stuff on
her walls, too. Just like you.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.840
My life lines these walls,
Mr. Bryton.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.877
And though I cannot
boast of legs,

14:38.879 --> 14:40.912
that are functioning...

14:40.914 --> 14:43.147
That keep me ambulatory.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.351
I still thank the Lord for
leaving me with a memory,

14:46.353 --> 14:50.054
a living memory of
my many adventures.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.824
Yeah, those adventures are
what I'm here about, Mr. Howe.

14:52.826 --> 14:55.226
You said that on the phone
that you were much more

14:55.228 --> 14:57.228
interested in me personally
than you were the room.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.732
Yes, because I saw this.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.267
- Oh!
- Yeah.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.602
And you have no idea, I'm up
here in this frozen shithole.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.704
I think my trip is a bust.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.707
And I feel like I just
stumbled into a goldmine,
with this thing.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.176
And you talk about
sharing stories.
That's what I do.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.945
I'm a storyteller by trade.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.247
Oh, I see. You're a...
You're a writer?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.082
Well, mmm-mmm.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.751
I'm a podcaster.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.219
What on earth is that?

15:21.221 --> 15:23.187
Oh...

15:23.189 --> 15:25.723
I'm sorry.
I'm not laughing at you.
You just...

15:25.725 --> 15:28.026
You just reminded me
of my mom.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.560
"Wally, what're you doing?"

15:29.562 --> 15:31.763
Ugh, she's the worst.
You're fantastic.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.865
Um, a podcast
is kinda like a...

15:33.867 --> 15:36.567
It's like a radio show
that's not on the radio.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.202
It's on...
It's on the Internet.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.604
Does that make sense?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.705
Uh-huh.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.274
Yeah.
That's also like my mom.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.976
It makes this sound
more confusing, doesn't it?

15:44.978 --> 15:47.145
Uh, it sounds like this.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.480
- Listen...
Now you listen to me.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.282
I just came in my pants.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.553
That's my McConaughey,
prematurely ejaculating.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.664
I pissed my pants.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.568
So you can actually
say those things
without any repercussion?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.837
Yeah, the audience likes it,
real and raunchy.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.238
So I try to keep it
real and raunchy.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
And real raunchy.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.278
You know the freedoms
your generation enjoys...

16:20.280 --> 16:22.613
- Hmm.
- Oh, I tell you...

16:22.615 --> 16:24.849
Libertines the lot of you.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.585
Can I just tell you something?

16:27.587 --> 16:28.786
This is gonna sound
really weird but...

16:28.788 --> 16:30.421
I've never had tea like this.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.789
It's blowing my mind.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.591
I feel like I've never
had tea in my life.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.693
Um, I'm like popping
my cherry.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.796
I'm not even a tea person.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.199
I believe we're all
tea people.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.600
There's a trick to it.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.270
You see,
you soak the leaves in
brandy before steeping.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.705
Of course.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.775
You can't lose with booze.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.111
"Well, always do sober
what you'd do drunk.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.346
"It will teach you to keep
your mouth shut."

16:55.348 --> 16:57.815
Okay, okay.
Now, this one, I know. Uh...

16:57.817 --> 16:59.283
Hemingway said that.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.019
Yes, he did.

17:01.987 --> 17:03.354
He said it to me.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.125
You knew Ernest Hemingway?

17:07.127 --> 17:09.260
Well, we met on
the waters of Normandy.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.997
You were there for D-Day?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.699
No, I was there before D-Day.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.234
I was there when it was
called Operation Neptune.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.170
Holy... Hold on.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.838
You were on the beach?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.707
No, no. I was on a boat
as was Ernie.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.342
Ernie?

17:24.344 --> 17:27.244
Ernie was deemed
"precious cargo"
by the powers that be,

17:27.247 --> 17:30.248
so he was prohibited
from joining the incursion.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.650
They ordered Hemingway
to stay on the boat?
Are you kidding?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.385
Yes, they did.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.055
Which vexed Mr. Hemingway,
to say the least.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.090
You know how he loved
to hunt the big game.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.392
Yeah.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.396
Big and the deadly.
Well, there was nothing bigger
or deadlier than a Nazi.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.566
Except perhaps a Nazi's
nagging wife.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.737
Nazi bitches. Of course.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.942
And so,
prohibited from joining
the incursion,

17:57.944 --> 18:01.746
Hemingway went to the galley
in search of alcohol.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.881
And the only one to oblige
him, of course,

18:03.883 --> 18:07.185
was a 16-year-old potato
peeler on KP duty.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.888
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

18:10.890 --> 18:13.691
<i>Holy shit, no kidding.</i>

18:13.693 --> 18:18.429
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>so I proffered for Hemingway</i>
<i>a bottle of Wiser.</i>

18:18.431 --> 18:21.632
<i>And I'll never forget
what he did next.</i>

18:21.634 --> 18:25.369
There was a smile crawled
across the man's face.

18:25.371 --> 18:28.806
It was so slow as if it
were a caterpillar.

18:28.808 --> 18:32.076
<i>Then he turned to me and</i>
<i>slapped me on the back</i>
<i>and he said,</i>

18:32.078 --> 18:36.581
"You are a kitchen witch
of only good fortune."

18:36.583 --> 18:38.282
Kitchen witch?

18:39.384 --> 18:41.619
God.

18:41.621 --> 18:47.125
So we drank Wiser and
when the reports
came back of how many...

18:49.428 --> 18:52.163
boys had
fallen at Omaha.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.631
That's when he said to me,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.235
"Only do sober what
you'd do drunk.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.537
"It will teach you to keep
your mouth shut."

19:02.508 --> 19:06.410
Oh, God, that's...
That's nuts, man!

19:06.412 --> 19:08.746
It's incredible.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.115
Well, actually, if you look
to the right of the fireplace,

19:11.117 --> 19:13.037
you'll see
the incredible aspect.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.724
This is the bottle?

19:21.026 --> 19:23.194
Holy shit!

19:23.196 --> 19:26.030
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.665
Well, it's just an old bottle.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.267
But if you combine it
with a story,

19:29.269 --> 19:31.702
then it becomes,
if I may say so,

19:31.704 --> 19:33.037
a powerful talisman,

19:33.039 --> 19:35.673
a doorway to another
time and place.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.555
Perhaps, a drawbridge
to history.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.211
Yeah.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.612
So fucking cool.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.883
What's this?

19:49.988 --> 19:52.490
Ah!

19:52.492 --> 19:56.494
I see, you have an eye
for the unfamiliar and
the curiosity of a cat.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.163
That should take you very far.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.666
That is the baculum
of a walrus.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.468
The Alaskans call it an <i> oosik.</i>

20:04.470 --> 20:06.971
Oosik.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.408
Oh! So it's like a...
Like a walrus spine?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.330
No. It's more like
a walrus cock.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.580
Shut up!

20:15.582 --> 20:17.481
I am a dirty boy, aren't I?

20:17.483 --> 20:18.983
This is a walrus dick?

20:18.985 --> 20:21.719
No, no. That's the baculum.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.755
That's the bones found
in the penis of most
placental mammals

20:24.757 --> 20:26.591
excluding man, of course.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.858
Ah, that's not fair.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.227
You know,

20:29.229 --> 20:33.264
it is in aid of
sexual intercourse.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.567
It maintains the stiffness
of the animal
during coital penetration.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.236
Hey, if you got something
like this between your legs,

20:38.238 --> 20:40.037
you don't need any help
with coital penetration.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.707
Jesus Christ!

20:42.709 --> 20:45.509
You are a rapscallion of the
highest order, Mr. Bryton.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.178
- Can I get my hands on it?
- Yes, of course.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.913
Wow!

20:48.915 --> 20:53.284
No, what?
This is crazy.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.286
You'd be right to admire
the walrus.

20:55.288 --> 20:58.756
It is probably God's
most noble creature

20:58.758 --> 21:01.592
far more evolved than
any man I've ever known.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.529
Present company included.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.931
Thank you.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.766
You're welcome.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.568
I appreciate that.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.237
So where did you buy something
like this? A head shop?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.542
Well, I became acquainted
with a walrus

21:18.544 --> 21:20.411
when I was lost at sea.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.114
Shut the front door!
You were lost at sea?

21:23.116 --> 21:24.482
Yes.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.651
Who are you,
Rudyard fucking Kipling?

21:26.653 --> 21:29.620
In 1959,

21:29.622 --> 21:31.889
I was back on a boat.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.624
Around the Gulf of Anadyr

21:33.626 --> 21:35.459
which is the southern coast
of Siberia.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.762
In Chukchi Peninsula.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.264
Perhaps, the best years
of my life.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.434
My culinary capabilities
in small, sea-faring vessels

21:43.436 --> 21:45.169
earned me my passport
to the world.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.271
As a matter of fact,

21:47.273 --> 21:50.107
it was my magic with
a halibut that landed me
the chef's position

21:50.109 --> 21:52.076
on the <i> Anastasia</i>

21:52.078 --> 21:55.513
as we traversed into
Soviet waters exploring.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.516
Wait. So this is like...
What is this, like,
Cold War stuff?

21:58.518 --> 22:00.184
No, no, no.

22:00.186 --> 22:04.155
We were in search of
the Siberian Great White.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.456
The Great White Shark?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.291
No way.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.027
Yes. And the Russians
called the hungry god

22:10.029 --> 22:11.529
"The Whale Eater."

22:11.531 --> 22:13.264
Oh!

22:13.266 --> 22:15.299
It's reported to be
25 feet in length,

22:15.301 --> 22:17.168
with some 3 tons on him.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.869
What?

22:19.504 --> 22:22.106
Holy shit! Did you find him?

22:22.108 --> 22:24.975
No, no. No, no.
We only found...

22:24.977 --> 22:27.845
Death off
the Chukchi Peninsula.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.182
In the inky heart
of night,

22:31.184 --> 22:33.784
the <i> Anastasia</i> collided
with an iceberg.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.621
<i>I watched a ship disappear
in minutes</i>

22:37.623 --> 22:40.624
<i>- into the black
Russian sea.</i>

22:40.626 --> 22:42.360
<i>Then I heard the screams</i>

22:42.362 --> 22:46.731
<i>of the crew silenced
in the Siberian brine.</i>

22:46.733 --> 22:48.733
So what happened
after the boat sank?

22:49.668 --> 22:50.968
I was alone.

22:53.038 --> 22:57.742
"Alone, alone, all alone,
on a white wide sea!

22:57.744 --> 23:02.246
"And never a saint took pity
on my soul in agony."

23:02.248 --> 23:04.168
<i>The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner.</i>

23:04.850 --> 23:06.417
Well remembered, Mr. Bryton.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.686
- Hmm.
- Well remembered.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.221
But you know,
when the screaming stopped,

23:10.223 --> 23:12.857
I thought I was alone
until something

23:12.859 --> 23:16.494
very swift and frightening
moved by me.

23:17.996 --> 23:22.066
"The many men, so beautiful!

23:22.068 --> 23:24.502
"And they all dead did lie

23:24.504 --> 23:27.772
"And a thousand,
thousand slimy things
lived on

23:27.774 --> 23:29.073
"And so did I."

23:30.375 --> 23:32.943
God! How scared were you?

23:33.912 --> 23:35.746
Oh!

23:35.748 --> 23:38.749
I don't mind admitting
I was terrified.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.186
I know you've probably
been scared a few times
in your life, Mr. Bryton.

23:42.188 --> 23:46.557
But I'd wager to say
you've never known
true terror.

23:46.559 --> 23:51.362
I became intimately familiar
with terror that night,
as I swam.

23:51.364 --> 23:53.697
I kicked at the water
and stroked for

23:53.699 --> 23:55.739
I know not where.
It was so pitch black.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.371
So I swam deeper and deeper
into the ebony void

24:00.373 --> 24:02.973
and I prayed that
whatever brushed by me

24:02.975 --> 24:06.977
was now feasting upon
the expedition crew instead.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.647
Sweet whistling Christ!

24:10.649 --> 24:14.885
I awoke on the shores
of a very small island,

24:14.887 --> 24:16.654
<i>regurgitating sea water,</i>

24:16.656 --> 24:19.990
<i>and discombobulated
beyond belief.</i>

24:19.992 --> 24:23.794
<i>And then as I
stood to my feet,</i>

24:23.796 --> 24:26.664
<i>I saw the sweetest sight
my orbs have ever taken in.</i>

24:26.666 --> 24:28.632
<i>I saw my savior.</i>

24:29.801 --> 24:31.635
I saw a walrus.

24:32.337 --> 24:34.171
A walrus?

24:34.173 --> 24:35.940
A walrus saved your life?

24:35.942 --> 24:38.342
- Yes.
- - What?

24:38.344 --> 24:40.678
This curious fellow
loomed over me,

24:40.680 --> 24:44.448
with tusks as tall as
Scylla and Charibdys.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.183
But it was...

24:46.185 --> 24:48.085
It was as gentle as
a milking cow

24:48.087 --> 24:50.588
and it took me into its
blubbery body to keep me warm,

24:50.590 --> 24:53.691
as if I were a newborn chick,
you see.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.659
Unbelievable!

24:55.661 --> 24:57.528
Yes.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.030
And though I couldn't know
what he was called

25:00.032 --> 25:02.666
by his marine brethren,

25:02.668 --> 25:06.270
I named him after
the only authority
figure I'd ever known,

25:06.272 --> 25:08.706
I ever trusted
in my entire life.

25:08.708 --> 25:12.843
The janitor at a boys' home
I had attended

25:12.845 --> 25:15.212
whose name was
Mr. Tuskegee.

25:15.214 --> 25:18.182
So I called my companion,
Mr. Tusk.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.652
Mr. Tusk? That's cute.

25:21.654 --> 25:22.686
Cute.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.289
Well,

25:25.291 --> 25:28.792
cute is for Chinese babies,
Mr. Bryton.

25:28.794 --> 25:32.229
But my walrus companion
was beautiful.

25:32.231 --> 25:35.699
I have never known such
a fulfilling friendship

25:35.701 --> 25:38.602
with anyone, human
or otherwise.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.339
And for six glorious months,

25:42.341 --> 25:44.508
I was at utter peace

25:44.510 --> 25:47.211
and I knew the only bliss

25:47.213 --> 25:50.314
this wretched life has
ever afforded me.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.118
What did you...

25:55.554 --> 25:56.954
What'd you...

25:58.925 --> 26:00.157
What'd you...

26:05.564 --> 26:06.964
There, there.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.233
It'll be all right.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.837
It'll be all right, Mr. Tusk.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.245
Oh, shit!

26:23.181 --> 26:24.481
Oh, fuck!

26:25.584 --> 26:27.117
Oh, shit!

26:27.119 --> 26:28.252
Ha!

26:28.254 --> 26:29.687
Why... Why're you stopping?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.422
I don't want you to go
to Canada tomorrow.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.557
Okay, I won't go to Canada!
Just finish...

26:33.559 --> 26:35.759
Oh, you're so full of shit,
your eyes are brown.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.127
I know. I know,
I'm full of shit.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.862
I'm bad. So spank me.
Spank me right there...

26:38.864 --> 26:40.264
- Nope. I'm not gonna do it.
- What?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.398
All right.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.300
Seriously? No, no.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.369
- It's gonna get on you, then.
- No! No!

26:45.371 --> 26:46.537
You don't even deserve
a selfie.

26:46.539 --> 26:48.706
Why not? Come on.
We talked about this.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.040
I'm gonna take a quick
Cana-deuce tomorrow.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.408
I'll be back in the morning.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.978
Hmm?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.146
Making fun of this kid on
the podcast is one thing,

26:56.148 --> 26:58.215
but to go over there
to his house...

26:58.217 --> 27:00.484
It's... It's horrible, okay?

27:00.486 --> 27:01.619
This just feels gamey.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.987
Gamey?

27:02.989 --> 27:05.155
Ally, the kid reached
out to me! Okay?

27:05.157 --> 27:07.791
He turned down Oprah fucking
Winfrey to talk to me.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.926
Me!

27:08.928 --> 27:11.261
Come on, this is huge
for the show.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.163
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna make of him.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.966
But, it's for the show.
It's for the podcast.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.801
You know you're a real
fucking asshole.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.404
And this, this does not
work for you at all.

27:22.273 --> 27:25.175
Doing your dopey comedy
sketches is bad enough.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.745
...But to exploit him
to his face...

27:27.747 --> 27:30.080
It's vicious.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.448
- The Wallace I fell in...
- No, that's vicious.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.617
To do what you did,
that's vicious.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.419
That's mean,
that's exploitative.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.354
To take a little taste
and walk away.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.956
- Are you serious?
- Mmm-hmm.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.659
The Wallace I fell in love
with would not do that.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.994
The Wallace I fell in love
with would never say
this stupid-ass shit.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.864
The Wallace you fell in love
with was an un-funny
little dick-hole

27:46.866 --> 27:48.365
who used to make
bad <i> Star Wars</i> puns

27:48.367 --> 27:50.300
and couldn't pay his bills.

27:50.302 --> 27:53.203
I... I'm sorry
but I kinda prefer
the new Wallace.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.674
New Wallace made 100 grand
in ads alone last year.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.709
That's before the T-shirt
sales and all the live shows.

27:58.711 --> 27:59.777
So...

28:03.215 --> 28:05.349
AMC is coming to see
the new Wallace's
showcase next week.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.684
Why do you think that is?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.318
'Cause of agents?

28:08.320 --> 28:10.187
'Cause he played the clubs
every fucking night

28:10.189 --> 28:11.789
like ol' unfunny Wallace
used to?

28:11.791 --> 28:14.158
No. It's 'cause he's a
juggernaut of a podcast,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.893
hosted by new Wallace.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.461
Old Wallace!

28:17.463 --> 28:19.797
Old Wallace was
a fucking loser

28:19.799 --> 28:21.131
who never popped
a piss in our window

28:21.133 --> 28:22.433
to throw it out.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.403
Old Wallace had me.

28:29.741 --> 28:31.241
Oh!

28:36.414 --> 28:39.216
- He'd like to have you again.
- So take me with you.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.218
If I bring you, you know this.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.687
Teddy gets weird and jealous
and then the show sucks.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.723
You know, he's got this thing.
Like if you're around,

28:45.725 --> 28:47.991
I'm not as funny as
I usually am

28:47.993 --> 28:49.493
'cause you're a distraction.
Blah, blah, blah.
I don't know.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.061
I can't figure out what's
going on in that kid's head.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.329
All I know is that
if it were up to me,

28:52.331 --> 28:54.064
of course, I would bring you.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.166
Old Wallace wouldn't give
a shit, he'd just take me.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.401
He'd just take me anyway.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.169
Ah, well!

28:59.171 --> 29:03.173
Old Wallace also
used to wear a fucking
stethoscope on stage.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.709
Oh, speaking of...

29:05.711 --> 29:08.412
We saw my first stand-up
set on the show today.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.180
Whoo! It was fucking brutal.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.082
It was even worse than
I remembered.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.685
It's really embarrassing,
actually.

29:14.687 --> 29:17.454
Teddy was dying.
Little shit.

29:17.456 --> 29:21.792
News flash. Cringe humor
attack shit is lame.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.561
Sorry, I didn't hear
what you're saying.
I just love that accent.

29:24.563 --> 29:28.065
It's lame,
this cringe humor...

29:28.067 --> 29:30.067
- Love your accent.
- I don't talk like that!

29:30.069 --> 29:31.435
I don't talk like that!

29:31.437 --> 29:33.804
...Listen, 'stache!

29:33.806 --> 29:36.607
That's the worst Latino accent
I have ever heard in my life.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.408
That's the worst
Latino accent
I've ever heard...

29:38.410 --> 29:40.778
Can you... Can you
just turn down
the funny right now, stache.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.146
The podcast's not on.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.047
- I know.
- It's just me and you.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.816
I'm trying to be lovey-dovey.
You're fucking it up.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.218
Fuck, it's... Because I have

29:48.220 --> 29:50.621
a raging hard-on!

29:50.623 --> 29:53.157
I wanna be lovey-dovey too.
I love lovey-dovey.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.092
But we can be lovey-dovey on
the phone when I'm in Canada.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.927
You know what we can't do
on the phone? Fuck.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.962
Why don't we that right now?
Come on.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.465
See? Come on.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.300
New Wallace is kinda funny.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.903
Yeah, he can be kinda funny.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.739
I just... I miss old Wallace.

30:08.741 --> 30:11.341
I miss you.
I miss the real you.
Is he in there?

30:11.343 --> 30:14.278
- Ugh!
- You know, that geeky kid.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.746
- Who even thanked me on stage.
- Geeky?

30:15.748 --> 30:18.348
Yeah, geeky.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.685
I miss the guy who told me,
he loved me
the first time we had sex.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.727
The guy who gets baked and
cries watching
<i>Winnie the Pooh.</i>

30:25.824 --> 30:28.425
You're so sweet.
Such a softy.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.061
Nothing soft about me now.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.498
Yeah, I know and it sucks.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.967
- Relax.
- Okay.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.006
What?

31:50.541 --> 31:51.541
Well...

31:52.877 --> 31:54.144
Look who's back.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.488
I must say you scared
the bejesus out of me.

32:05.790 --> 32:08.091
Oh, what kind of nurse am I?

32:09.394 --> 32:12.262
Here you go, here's your cup.

32:16.267 --> 32:19.269
Wet your whistle,
my dry little thistle.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.575
What...

32:25.577 --> 32:26.877
Wha...

32:26.879 --> 32:28.599
- What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.280
Oh, my dear boy.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.282
Well, you passed out
right in front of me.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.784
Yeah.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.919
So tired.

32:35.921 --> 32:38.622
I mean, one moment,
I'm waxing lyrically

32:38.624 --> 32:40.991
about my many ocean voyages,
and the next thing I know,

32:40.993 --> 32:43.393
you fell out of your chair
and collapsed.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.495
I didn't know what it was
until I looked down,

32:45.497 --> 32:48.065
and I saw this rather
intimidating spider

32:48.067 --> 32:49.566
crawling down your pant leg.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.169
Spider?

32:53.304 --> 32:55.639
Yes, a brown recluse.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.075
A rather toxic little insect.
These woods are full of them.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.945
Yeah, some of them
are poisonous.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.080
Hmm.

33:05.416 --> 33:07.351
Oh, shit! A spider bit me?

33:08.419 --> 33:10.454
Yes, well, I'm so sorry.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.756
Where's my phone?

33:12.758 --> 33:14.257
- Phone?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.793
I got to make a call.

33:16.795 --> 33:20.464
Well, I'm afraid
the doctor stepped on it
and broke it.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.032
I'm afraid it lies in pieces.

33:23.468 --> 33:26.136
Mmm. There was a doctor here?

33:26.138 --> 33:28.805
Yes, Doctor Moseeay.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.508
He lives just up the road
around 8 miles.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.343
- Moseeay?
- Yeah.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.778
- Kind of
a funny name.
-Yeah.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.514
He was here within
a half an hour of your...

33:37.516 --> 33:38.849
Incident.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.285
I forget your name.

33:42.287 --> 33:44.855
My name?
Howard Howe.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.892
Mmm, Howard, I can't
feel my legs.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.294
Well, that would be the spinal
injection you see. They...

33:52.864 --> 33:55.332
The Recluse sank her
fangs into you

33:55.334 --> 33:57.494
and filled you with
so much poison that your...

33:58.569 --> 34:01.304
Your ankle was the size
of an elephant's leg.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.573
Oh, shit.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.142
What kind of an elephant?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.710
A very fat one.

34:06.712 --> 34:07.712
Mmm-hmm.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.313
- Shit!
- Yeah.

34:11.315 --> 34:15.018
So, with the venom traveling
to your heart

34:15.020 --> 34:17.587
it forced the doctor,
to save your life,

34:17.589 --> 34:20.791
to take, as we say...
Drastic measures.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.168
Oh, my God!

34:32.370 --> 34:34.271
Oh, my God.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.672
Holy shit!

34:35.674 --> 34:37.908
There's no leg there.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.744
Doesn't appear to be.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.411
Just let it out, dear boy.
Let it all out.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.481
My leg is off.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.783
Oh, my God.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.219
Nature can be very red in
tooth and claw.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.554
What?

34:50.556 --> 34:52.355
Tennyson.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.757
What the fuck are
you talking about?

34:54.760 --> 34:57.861
Why am I still here?
Why aren't I in the hospital?

34:57.863 --> 34:59.763
Well, hospitals...

35:00.398 --> 35:01.865
Carry diseases.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.868
So, Dr. Moseeay thought it
would be best if you...

35:04.870 --> 35:08.939
Well, just stay here since
the room is sanitized
all day.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.740
It would be best
if you recuperate here.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.809
It doesn't make any sense.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.479
Spider. The spider bit you.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.247
All right,
I wanna walk to this guy.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.082
Where's the doctor?
I wanna talk to him.

35:19.084 --> 35:24.488
Well, uh... The doctor's
making his rounds.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.124
Rounds? What rounds?
We're in the middle
of nowhere!

35:27.126 --> 35:29.392
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

35:29.394 --> 35:30.460
No, we're not.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.729
No, we're not, Mr. Bryton.

35:32.731 --> 35:36.466
I've been to the
middle of nowhere.
And it is a ghastly place.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.802
I don't want to hear your
fucking stories.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.837
What the fuck is this?

35:40.839 --> 35:43.974
...Why are you laughing?

35:43.976 --> 35:46.243
You're funny.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.078
Well, that's a belt
to keep you from falling
out of your chair, you see.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.813
Why?

35:49.815 --> 35:53.150
The belt is to keep you
from falling over until
the spinal wears off...

35:53.152 --> 35:56.286
Spinal wears off and you get
full control of your
faculties again.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.855
That is, most of
your faculties.

36:00.625 --> 36:04.327
I... I need a phone.
I gotta call my family.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.796
Doctor Moseeay removed
all the phones from the house.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.298
He didn't want you disturbed.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.366
What the fuck?

36:09.368 --> 36:11.668
So, I'll talk to him

36:11.670 --> 36:14.704
and I can ask him if you can
call home after supper.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.473
I gotta call.

36:16.475 --> 36:17.774
So it would be best
if you take a nap.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.643
You're heavily,
heavily tranquilized.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.379
I got to tell my family.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.282
I gotta use a phone...
I gotta talk to a doctor.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.717
- Moseeay, Dr. Moseeay.
- I wanna talk to him.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.120
Well, you can't.
You see, he is on his rounds.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.956
You give me a phone.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.458
Don't have a phone.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.061
The doctor removed them all.

36:38.063 --> 36:40.864
That's... Insane.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.799
Possibly so, but it's true.

36:47.338 --> 36:51.041
We sup at 6:00 sharp.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.277
Wait, wait.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.913
Wait, wait, wait.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.616
All right, wait.

37:06.257 --> 37:07.757
I am...

37:10.761 --> 37:13.263
...truly sorry for your loss.

37:32.783 --> 37:34.451
You're not eating?

37:45.630 --> 37:47.797
I can't move my arms.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.333
Well...

37:52.370 --> 37:53.530
That would be the morphine.

38:00.044 --> 38:03.113
It is capital
for the leg pain,

38:03.115 --> 38:07.917
and perhaps the only thing
keeps you from
howling in agony.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.520
But it does tend to
leave one a bit sleepy.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.293
I'm not sleepy.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.995
At all.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.997
- I'm immobilized.
- Hmm.

38:22.900 --> 38:23.900
Well...

38:24.969 --> 38:26.036
You know...

38:27.972 --> 38:29.039
I was thinking...

38:30.474 --> 38:31.908
The melancholy

38:32.777 --> 38:34.577
of losing a limb

38:35.413 --> 38:37.180
must be akin to

38:37.182 --> 38:39.416
mourning a close friend
that you

38:39.418 --> 38:41.351
too often took for granted.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.587
Hmm...

38:54.498 --> 38:56.378
There was no spider,
was there?

38:58.636 --> 39:00.970
Yes, there was.
A brown recluse.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.342
Colloquially called
the hobo spider.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.676
Ah, that's interesting.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.213
And you saw it?

39:11.882 --> 39:13.083
Yeah.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.453
You saw the spider?

39:19.490 --> 39:22.058
I... I just wish that I had
spied the little creature

39:22.060 --> 39:24.761
before it so
viciously attacked you.

39:28.733 --> 39:29.773
What'd it look like?

39:33.237 --> 39:34.871
The Arachnid Assailant?

39:34.873 --> 39:36.806
- Yeah.
- Well...

39:38.142 --> 39:41.044
A typical spider...

39:41.046 --> 39:44.247
A legion of legs, you know,
etc, etc. It was
very small though.

39:46.817 --> 39:50.553
So small you might even
call it Itsy Bitsy.

39:50.555 --> 39:55.325
<i>¶ The Itsy, Bitsy Spider
went up the water spout</i>

39:55.327 --> 39:56.926
Holy shit...

39:56.928 --> 40:01.364
<i>¶ Down came the rain
and washed the spider out</i>

40:01.366 --> 40:04.367
Let me out of this chair,
you fucking psycho!

40:04.369 --> 40:08.304
Let me out! Let me out,
you old fucking nutbag!

40:15.346 --> 40:17.480
Help! Somebody help!

40:37.101 --> 40:42.739
Now, shall we dispense with
the chuffa, Mr. Bryton?

40:42.741 --> 40:47.310
Perhaps it would be best,
in this, our
burgeoning relationship,

40:47.312 --> 40:50.814
to reveal our hearts
with absolute candor.

40:52.884 --> 40:56.119
See, for some time now

40:57.421 --> 41:00.023
I've been constructing

41:00.958 --> 41:04.327
a very realistic walrus suit.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.565
What?

41:08.567 --> 41:13.503
And I believe with just a few
minor modifications
it will fit you perfectly.

41:13.505 --> 41:17.674
Jesus. What the fuck, man?

41:17.676 --> 41:19.275
But,

41:19.277 --> 41:24.414
whilst in the walrus suit
you must be a walrus.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.816
There will be no sound
of a human voice.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.952
You must communicate

41:28.954 --> 41:30.086
everything you do

41:30.088 --> 41:31.321
as a walrus.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.122
Do you understand?

41:33.791 --> 41:36.659
Please... Please...

41:36.661 --> 41:38.261
No, no, no.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.998
Be not vexed or
heavy of heart, Mr. Bryton.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.471
We two are embarking on
an expedition not unlike that
of the doomed <i> Anastasia.</i>

41:48.473 --> 41:51.975
Their mistake was
they look for the monsters
out there.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.476
They shouldn't
have left the dock.

41:53.478 --> 41:56.112
The beast has always
lied within.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.218
Why?

42:02.786 --> 42:04.621
Why are you doing this?

42:04.623 --> 42:06.623
Why?

42:06.625 --> 42:07.924
Why?

42:10.327 --> 42:13.530
To solve a riddle older
than the Sphinx.

42:13.532 --> 42:16.399
To answer the question
which has plagued us

42:16.401 --> 42:19.002
since we first crawled
from this Earth

42:19.004 --> 42:21.437
and stood erect in the sun.

42:23.807 --> 42:27.844
Is man, indeed,

42:27.846 --> 42:30.246
a walrus at heart?

42:37.422 --> 42:39.289
Help!

43:03.047 --> 43:05.081
I almost told him,
before he left.

43:07.952 --> 43:09.285
Sometimes I forget,

43:11.789 --> 43:13.456
that my life is...

43:15.259 --> 43:19.495
An intricate, delicate
web of lies.

43:22.032 --> 43:23.967
And I feel so normal...

43:24.868 --> 43:26.302
So banal.

43:29.139 --> 43:31.874
It feels so amazing
to be boring.

43:33.210 --> 43:35.211
And faithful.

43:35.213 --> 43:36.512
And sinless.

43:40.084 --> 43:42.418
I even forget what
we're doing to him.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.124
Till I remember what he
does to me...

43:49.126 --> 43:52.829
With all those empty women.

43:55.232 --> 43:57.934
And it... Crushes me.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.471
And I hate him.

44:03.774 --> 44:06.075
I hate him.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.711
But I hate myself so much more

44:10.447 --> 44:12.367
for letting any man
do this to me.

44:16.086 --> 44:18.988
I'm happy my dad's not
alive to see this.

44:21.325 --> 44:24.293
To see his only little girl

44:24.295 --> 44:29.265
put her life on hold for some
cheating fucking asshole.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.509
And I just
wanna fucking die.

44:42.446 --> 44:46.149
But every time
he destroys me, you...

44:46.151 --> 44:48.184
You bring me back.

44:50.954 --> 44:53.189
You make me feel
beautiful again.

44:54.825 --> 44:56.726
Cherished...

44:58.962 --> 45:01.130
You give me my humanity.

45:03.467 --> 45:07.904
Even though we're stripping
it down every time we're doing
this, I...

45:07.906 --> 45:09.205
Honestly...

45:10.307 --> 45:12.307
I don't know
how to live without you.

45:14.411 --> 45:15.545
So look out,
you crazy Canucks.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.914
Something weird-ass
this way comes!

45:17.916 --> 45:20.249
Next week,
Wanderin' Wallace takes
a raunchy road trip

45:20.251 --> 45:23.052
up to the Great White North
to meet with a star.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.188
I will be staying at home.
Per usual.

45:25.190 --> 45:27.156
Doing what, Teddy?
Why don't you film it?

45:27.158 --> 45:29.092
Let's have a real
laugh after that tape.

45:29.094 --> 45:32.729
I... I will be taking your
significant other
to the Getty

45:32.731 --> 45:36.165
because in her words,
"You don't get art."

45:36.167 --> 45:38.101
I get art too.
Why do you keep
saying that? I get art.

45:38.103 --> 45:40.236
I get it when it's got my
face on it.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.071
It's all over the wall.
Look at it. Look at all this.
This is art.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.406
Do you think this is art?

45:43.408 --> 45:44.607
It's like a me-seum.

45:44.609 --> 45:47.343
It's not wrong... All over
the walls of this, uh...

45:47.345 --> 45:48.745
Studio.

45:48.747 --> 45:52.448
We sort of created a
man cave/masturbation chamber,

45:52.450 --> 45:54.851
uh, to while away
the hours in.

45:54.853 --> 45:57.353
I got to say, I've never
jerked off in here,
which is surprising,

45:57.355 --> 45:58.187
'cause I jerk off
all the time.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.922
I don't believe you.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.124
Okay, you're right
to not to believe me.

46:01.126 --> 46:02.525
Teddy, you are
my fucking hero.

46:02.527 --> 46:03.860
You're taking my girlfriend
to the Getty.

46:03.862 --> 46:05.595
Ally and Teddy go to the Getty.

46:05.597 --> 46:06.863
-Aw.
-It's adorable.
It's like a children's book.

46:06.865 --> 46:09.232
Yeah. Until next time,
I'm Teddy Craft.

46:09.234 --> 46:11.601
And this is Wallace Bryton
reminding you to...

46:11.603 --> 46:14.103
Join ze Not-See Party!

46:15.572 --> 46:17.874
Clear! Nice!

46:17.876 --> 46:19.876
That was amazing!

46:19.878 --> 46:21.110
I don't know where
you were going with
that video

46:21.112 --> 46:22.078
but I'm glad you did it.
It was embarrassing,

46:22.080 --> 46:23.579
but shit,
that was fucking funny.

46:23.581 --> 46:25.882
All fucking hail
the Not-See Party!

46:25.884 --> 46:27.617
Yeah, everyone except Ally.

46:27.619 --> 46:29.752
Ah... Dude, she just wants
to go with you.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.254
I know. I know!

46:31.256 --> 46:33.322
Teddy, why are you always
defending her? It's so weird.

46:33.324 --> 46:35.892
And I know she wants to come.
But you know, her whole thing
is like,

46:35.894 --> 46:38.294
"Wally, why do you have to do
such mean comedy?"

46:38.296 --> 46:39.896
That doesn't even
sound like her.

46:39.898 --> 46:41.898
I can't have her around if I'm
gonna get real with this kid.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.833
And I got to get
real with him.
This is way too important.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.169
I can't be me if she is there.

46:46.171 --> 46:48.838
I also can't get road-head
if she's there either.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.340
You're a fucking numbskull to
cheat on someone that hot.

46:51.342 --> 46:54.343
Teddy, it has nothing to do
with how hot she is.
I know she's hot.

46:54.345 --> 46:56.946
But there's some top shelf
ass out there
who listen to us.

46:56.948 --> 46:58.681
I'm not kidding.

46:58.683 --> 46:59.982
Plus you haven't seen
these other girls.

46:59.984 --> 47:02.418
I mean don't short change
them, okay?

47:02.420 --> 47:04.821
These fan girls, they may be
pasty and a little chunky,
but they're...

47:04.823 --> 47:07.323
-They're really sexual.
-You bring shame
to the Not-See Party.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.858
I know Ally's hot.

47:08.860 --> 47:10.626
It doesn't take away
from how hot she is.

47:10.628 --> 47:12.628
I'm not married to her.
I know I sound shitty
right now.

47:12.630 --> 47:14.030
I can see you judging me.

47:14.032 --> 47:15.364
You going to Ally's now?

47:15.366 --> 47:17.133
Fuck, yeah, I'm going
over there now.

47:17.135 --> 47:18.701
I wanna try to break one off
before I fly tomorrow.

47:18.703 --> 47:21.170
So I can get all
quiet and peaceful
in the plane,

47:21.172 --> 47:23.372
and I don't cause any
disturbances at the airport.

47:23.374 --> 47:25.308
- It... It's like my Xanax.
- Mmm.

47:25.310 --> 47:28.430
I got to get the white out
and I go to bed,
like a little baby.

48:06.316 --> 48:07.884
Fuck.

48:20.430 --> 48:22.350
He hasn't called me
in three days.

48:26.670 --> 48:29.605
I have this pain in my
stomach. I...

48:31.209 --> 48:32.508
I'm worried.

48:36.947 --> 48:38.915
Ally. Ally,
you got to help me.

48:38.917 --> 48:41.350
I swear to God I'm not joking,
okay?

48:42.619 --> 48:45.888
I was abducted.
I'm in Manitoba.

48:45.890 --> 48:49.258
This guy wants to turn me
into an animal or something!

48:49.260 --> 48:50.693
He's fucking nuts!

48:50.695 --> 48:53.195
You gotta please come!
Please! Please! Please!

48:55.365 --> 48:57.233
I don't know where he is.

48:57.235 --> 49:00.036
But I'm somewhere in his
weird fucking house.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.273
I'm like two hours
from Winnipeg.

49:06.443 --> 49:08.611
I'm so fucking scared.

49:09.813 --> 49:11.893
I'm so scared I'm not gonna
see you again.

49:13.583 --> 49:15.518
I'm sorry
I was such an asshole.

49:16.887 --> 49:18.220
I'm so sorry.

49:20.290 --> 49:23.726
He cut off my
fucking leg, Ally.

49:23.728 --> 49:27.897
Okay? Please. Okay.
Okay, just get here, okay?

49:27.899 --> 49:30.733
Call the cops.

49:30.735 --> 49:33.703
Ally...
Ally, I don't wanna
die in Canada.

49:35.505 --> 49:36.906
I don't wanna die at all.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.742
Oh, fuck.

49:40.344 --> 49:42.378
Fuck.

49:46.249 --> 49:48.317
Okay.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.252
Oh, Teddy, pick up.

49:50.254 --> 49:54.790
<i>I... honestly...</i>

49:54.792 --> 49:57.193
<i>I don't know how to live
without you.</i>

49:59.429 --> 50:03.065
So go brush your teeth and
come back to bed, because...

50:04.368 --> 50:06.936
I don't want to sit here
crying all night.

50:26.390 --> 50:30.126
Teddy, it's me! I swear to God
this is no fucking joke.

50:30.128 --> 50:31.560
I'm being held captive.

50:32.963 --> 50:35.164
I'm not kidding,
I'm being held captive

50:35.166 --> 50:38.467
by some crazy motherfucker.
He cut off my fucking leg!

50:38.469 --> 50:40.703
Listen to me,
you gotta call the cops.

50:40.705 --> 50:44.006
I'm, like... I'm, like,
two hours north of Winnipeg.

50:44.008 --> 50:48.644
I'm somewhere... I'm somewhere
in, like, bumfuck Manitoba.

50:48.646 --> 50:52.815
This guy's name
is Howard Howe, okay?
It's Howard Howe.

50:52.817 --> 50:55.184
You gotta call the cops.

50:55.186 --> 50:57.253
Call the cops.

50:57.255 --> 50:58.587
I don't know exactly
what happened.

50:58.589 --> 51:00.189
I'm scared shitless, man.

51:00.191 --> 51:02.658
I think he wants to turn me
into, like, a...

51:04.761 --> 51:07.496
What the fuck was that?

51:09.166 --> 51:11.667
Your life as you knew it
is over, Mr. Bryton.

51:11.669 --> 51:14.236
So if you wish to
continue living,

51:14.238 --> 51:18.641
you will be a walrus,
or you'll be nothing at all.

52:11.261 --> 52:12.828
This'll fucking help.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.930
<i>Ally. Ally,
you've got to help me.</i>

52:14.932 --> 52:18.567
<i>I swear to God
I'm not joking, okay?</i>

52:18.569 --> 52:21.470
<i>I was abducted.
I'm in Manitoba.</i>

52:21.472 --> 52:24.607
<i>This guy wants to turn me into
an animal or something.</i>

52:26.310 --> 52:27.376
Teddy.

52:27.911 --> 52:29.111
Ted.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.679
Hey.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.816
Wake up.
Wallace. It's Wallace.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.451
- What?
- He's in trouble.

52:35.453 --> 52:36.752
He's in trouble.

52:37.821 --> 52:38.854
What?

52:40.924 --> 52:42.764
Oh, my God,
he called you too.

52:43.093 --> 52:44.960
Oh, my God.

52:44.962 --> 52:46.362
Check it.

52:58.275 --> 53:03.045
Well, someone's looking
for Wallace!

53:05.015 --> 53:07.316
It must be nice to know
that somebody
cares about you that much.

53:07.318 --> 53:10.953
Just what I felt on the island
with Mr. Tusk.

53:10.955 --> 53:15.491
He was the only living thing
that ever had
my best interests at heart.

53:15.493 --> 53:18.727
As a child,
I was not cared for
so much as I was...

53:18.729 --> 53:21.730
Filed away,
like a document.

53:21.732 --> 53:24.333
A document fed into
a shredding machine

53:24.335 --> 53:26.869
and fueled by the blood
of the innocent.

53:26.871 --> 53:31.006
You see, I am a
Duplessis Orphan.

53:31.008 --> 53:38.080
Now, Maurice Duplessis
was the Premier of Quebec
in those days.

53:38.548 --> 53:40.516
He was the head
of the Conservative Party

53:40.518 --> 53:43.519
and with strong ties
to the Catholic Church.

53:43.521 --> 53:45.487
As a matter of fact,

53:45.489 --> 53:48.991
it was in collusion with
these charlatans of the Lord

53:48.993 --> 53:54.697
that Duplessis brought upon
Quebec <i> La Grande Noirceur...</i>

53:54.699 --> 53:56.932
"The Great Darkness."

53:57.601 --> 53:59.835
As a boy of 10,

53:59.837 --> 54:02.671
my mother and father
took me to Montreal.

54:02.673 --> 54:04.673
I had never seen anything
so beautiful and bright

54:04.675 --> 54:06.609
and big and wonderful
in my life.

54:06.611 --> 54:08.944
But...

54:08.946 --> 54:12.248
When night falls
in Montreal,

54:12.250 --> 54:16.585
the monsters come out to play.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.421
We were walking to dinner,
and were accosted by
brigands in a back alley.

54:19.423 --> 54:22.124
My father was stabbed
several times
with the mugger's knife.

54:22.126 --> 54:26.895
And my mother's throat
was slashed,
as if she were cattle.

54:26.897 --> 54:30.933
I was placed
in an abandoned boys' home
in Quebec.

54:30.935 --> 54:33.736
Boys whose lives
had been destroyed.

54:33.738 --> 54:37.606
Provinces were responsible
financially for all
of the orphanages.

54:37.608 --> 54:43.312
The government
was responsible for
the mental institutions.

54:43.314 --> 54:49.618
So Duplessis and the Church,
they came up with a scheme
to obtain more money

54:49.620 --> 54:54.757
by reclassifying
the orphanages as
mental health-care facilities.

54:54.759 --> 54:57.559
And when nobody
raised their voice in protest,

54:57.561 --> 54:59.561
why, they just shut down
the orphanages

54:59.563 --> 55:05.234
and sent all the children,
including me,
to insane asylums.

55:05.236 --> 55:08.304
And so for the next
five years,

55:08.306 --> 55:09.905
I was beaten,

55:09.907 --> 55:11.573
I was tortured,

55:12.108 --> 55:14.576
I was raped.

55:14.578 --> 55:19.148
I have had things in my mouth
that no human being
should ever taste.

55:19.150 --> 55:22.084
They never thought
of me as a person.
They just thought to use me.

55:22.086 --> 55:23.519
And use me they did.

55:25.488 --> 55:29.625
Priests, politicians...

55:29.627 --> 55:31.360
All pederasts.

55:31.362 --> 55:36.332
Even the nurses
and nuns and night watchmen.

55:36.334 --> 55:39.034
All of them witches,
all there to satisfy

55:39.036 --> 55:42.971
their most base physical
and financial desires...

55:42.973 --> 55:46.175
Through the rectum
and lips of a child.

55:47.277 --> 55:50.946
So with no one to answer to
for their horrid crimes,

55:52.282 --> 55:54.483
these devils ran amuck
with my innocence.

55:55.985 --> 56:02.224
But at age 15,
I escaped Canada.

56:02.226 --> 56:08.030
I went to the United States,
got on a boat,
and never looked back.

56:08.032 --> 56:10.132
Until now.

56:10.900 --> 56:12.901
Yes...

56:12.903 --> 56:16.038
Man is a savage animal,
Mr. Bryton.

56:22.145 --> 56:24.880
Better to be a walrus.

56:34.324 --> 56:37.426
Yes, Officer,
it's B-R-Y-T-O-N...

56:37.428 --> 56:40.562
We know he rented a car,
but we don't know
exactly where from,

56:40.564 --> 56:42.364
so as soon as we land
in Winnipeg,

56:42.366 --> 56:44.666
we're just gonna go
to every rental desk
at the airport

56:44.668 --> 56:46.068
and see if anyone
recognizes him.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.336
Tell 'em if can't find
the agency,

56:47.338 --> 56:49.571
we can find the car
using its GPS system.

56:49.573 --> 56:53.175
Recent pictures? Yes,
there are some recent pictures
up on the website.

56:53.177 --> 56:55.077
- It's NotSeeParty.com...
- Spell it, spell it!

56:55.079 --> 56:57.613
Hello? Hello?

56:57.615 --> 56:58.947
They fucking hung up.

57:36.252 --> 57:39.221
"The sun was shining
on the sea

57:39.223 --> 57:41.790
"Shining with all his might

57:41.792 --> 57:43.625
"He did his very best to make

57:43.627 --> 57:46.829
"The billows
smooth and bright

57:47.831 --> 57:52.134
"And this was odd,
because it was

57:52.136 --> 57:54.803
"The middle of the night."

58:04.648 --> 58:09.585
Oh, now, now, Mr. Tusk.
There, there, there,
I understand.

58:09.587 --> 58:12.621
- It's so very hard to be...

58:12.623 --> 58:15.090
...the elephant
of the deep blue sea.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.626
...Stop, stop. Stop it.

58:17.628 --> 58:21.563
Stop it. Walruses never cry!

58:34.043 --> 58:36.278
Oh, I've missed you,
Mr. Tusk.

58:40.350 --> 58:45.053
How I've missed
our merry times together
on Ponder Rock.

58:54.030 --> 58:58.133
<i>I've regretted</i>
<i>every day</i>
<i>my return to this wretched...</i>

58:58.135 --> 59:00.502
<i>Civilization.</i>

59:00.504 --> 59:03.906
<i>This anxious, silly world,</i>

59:03.908 --> 59:08.544
<i>with all the banality
of a breakfast cereal.</i>

59:08.546 --> 59:13.749
<i>The worst of man</i>
<i>has long been fetid</i>
<i>with greed and indifference.</i>

59:13.751 --> 59:15.918
<i>The best of man</i>

59:15.920 --> 59:20.889
<i>has long been lobotomized
by reality television.</i>

59:22.326 --> 59:25.761
<i>I never should have
left the wilderness.</i>

59:25.763 --> 59:28.397
<i>I never should have left you.</i>

59:28.399 --> 59:31.166
<i>This writhing nest
of two-legged bipeds...</i>

59:31.168 --> 59:32.935
Wallace!

59:32.937 --> 59:37.673
<i>Each devouring
the other to stay alive.</i>

59:37.675 --> 59:40.175
<i>And I betrayed you for what?</i>

59:41.177 --> 59:43.278
<i>Man's world?</i>

59:43.280 --> 59:47.049
<i>An immoral cesspool,</i>

59:47.051 --> 59:50.419
<i>boded with the wayward
and the destitute...</i>

59:50.421 --> 59:51.954
<i>Howard Howe.</i>

59:51.956 --> 59:55.357
<i>You gotta call the cops.
Call the cops.</i>

59:55.359 --> 59:57.392
<i>I don't know exactly
what happened.</i>

59:57.394 --> 59:59.795
<i>I'm scared shitless, man.</i>

59:59.797 --> 01:00:03.398
<i>- I think he wants to turn me
into, like, a... Like, a...</i>

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.635
- That's it?
- It just ends.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.637
Are you sure he is not
pulling your legs?

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:11.206
Getting up to some good old
American monkeyshines?

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.741
That doesn't sound like
monkeyshines.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.776
But you say you do
these comedy podcasts.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.111
Could this just be
for grins and giggles?

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.846
We do...
We do a podcast.

01:00:17.848 --> 01:00:20.816
But he wouldn't take
something this far.
He's not that kind of guy.

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:22.217
Okay, now stick with me here.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.119
I don't mean to be indelicate,

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.722
but could there be some
sort of sexual angle?

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:29.858
A romantic entanglement?
An affair or something?

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:34.896
No. He's not that kind of guy.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.168
Okay.
Well, I did some checking,

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:44.339
and we don't have
a Howard Howe
anywhere in Manitoba.

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:45.641
Shit!

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:48.076
With regard to your friend,
I asked Border Patrol

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:50.312
if they got a report of him
leaving the country yet.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.081
They say he come
into Winnipeg, and that's it.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.950
Don't you two worry.

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:56.918
I'm gonna issue
a Missing Persons on him,

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.787
same as they do in the States.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.589
Thank you.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:02.824
But I'll tell you,
that leg bit...

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:06.995
It sure puts the BM
in the PM's coffee, eh?

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:08.363
That is something.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:10.265
It's creepy, right?

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:12.934
No, no, it's something.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:16.538
I had a fella come in here
from Quebec two days ago,

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.808
asking about any
legless bodies that
might've turned up.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.510
Used to be a cop.

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:25.380
Said he is hunting
some kinda serial killer.

01:01:25.382 --> 01:01:27.783
I told him, "Canada doesn't
have any serial killers.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.285
"Unless you count the pothead

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:33.455
"who took out all
the Cap'n Crunch last night
at the Eh-2-Zed."

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:35.290
Anyway...

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.894
He gave me his number
and he left it.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.696
I'll take it.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.043
Ahoy, matey!

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:06.421
You know, it occurs to me...

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:11.526
...that if you are to fulfill
your destiny...

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:14.262
If you are to be
a true walrus...

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.133
Well, Mr. Tusk...

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:22.771
A walrus must learn to swim.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:39.688
Whoa, good!

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:44.359
Now, that's it.
Show me how the fishies swim.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:47.529
Swim. Now, come on.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:52.033
Come on, damn you. Swim!

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:08.216
Yes, come on. Swim!

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.621
I am Guy Lapointe.
That is my name.

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:47.856
Guy Lapointe.

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:50.859
And I spend 20 years
as the inspector

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.628
of the Surete du Quebec.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.798
And but for the last
10 years of my life,

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.334
I have been hunting an animal

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:03.338
who is doing the masquerade
as the man.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.842
I have been hunting
this Howard Howe.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:09.511
Howard Howe,

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:14.115
this elusive, uh...
Devil made of the flesh,

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:18.053
this serial killer
who makes the bringing

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:22.190
of the blood and terror
to the true north.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.525
I...

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:26.394
Am very dedicated man

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.965
and I have sacrificed
my life...

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.868
Too many marriages,
any chance at happiness,

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:37.372
and very likely,
some may say, my, uh...

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.907
sanity.

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:43.178
All in the pursuit of
this butcher of the men.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.680
And because of this...

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:53.555
The solace of the sleep
most of the time eludes me.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:57.158
But last night,
after you call me,

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.495
I sleep like
the breast-fed baby.

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:04.432
And I wake up this morning,
in the morning,

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:10.372
and I know that, in my bones,
my quarry is close.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:12.507
And he is so close

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:16.244
that I can almost
smell his shit.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.579
Pardon my French.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.750
Who has
the Blue Skies with fries?

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:24.185
- Oh, that would be me.
- There you go.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.288
How about
the Gimli Slider, no onions?

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:27.956
That would also be me.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.958
And a Mon-Sewer
Maurice Milkshake.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.793
That would also be me.

01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:34.562
Okay, here are some napkins.
You're gonna need those.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:35.964
All right. Have a nice flight.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.098
Thank you so much.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.536
Now, I'll tell you something.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.574
They don't have these
back home, you know.

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:49.444
You throw a rock
in Quebec City,

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.446
and it'll land in
a Chez Ashton. But...

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:56.418
Not a single goddamn
Gimli Slider.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.253
And that, in my opinion,

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:02.424
is the only failure of
the mighty people of Quebec.

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:04.893
How many people has he killed?

01:06:04.895 --> 01:06:06.728
Twenty-three.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.396
And if your friend
has been abducted

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:11.466
by the same monster
that I am hunting,

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.836
it is probably going to be
24 pretty soon.

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:19.240
His MO is always the same.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:21.977
A month after
the disappearance,

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:25.814
we find pieces
of the skinned body.

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:29.918
And the legs are always
amputated at the knees.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.922
Arms are always
fused to the body,

01:06:33.924 --> 01:06:37.425
like a kind of
a crucified T-Rex.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:40.595
You know, like that.
That's what it looks like.

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:45.633
And always the mouth
and the teeth
have been disturbed.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:46.635
How?

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.403
Mmm.

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.575
With a very thick, um...

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.545
Ah!

01:06:58.547 --> 01:06:59.881
What was I saying?

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:03.518
How have they been disturbed?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.888
In every case,
the tongues have been
ripped out.

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:07.890
Jesus!

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:10.125
Oh, yes.

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:13.167
It is one fuck
of a bummer to look at,
I can tell you that.

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.631
Were any of them...

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.634
Sexually...

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:22.670
Oh, no, no.
He doesn't touch them
like that.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.072
He butchers them.

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:27.409
Amputates limbs,
cuts out tongues.

01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:31.646
But he don't do nothing
sexy with them, you know.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:33.214
Never.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:38.686
The boys on the force
nicknamed this killer
"The First Wife,"

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:42.157
because the first wife
doesn't let you talk,

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:46.494
she doesn't let you
go anywhere,
and she does not fuck you.

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.331
See it's...

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:54.335
And she don't fuck you.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:57.205
It's... It's funnier
if you've been married
a few times.

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:59.207
Maybe we should be talking
to someone else.

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.608
Mmm...

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:04.679
I think that
that's a very good idea

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.881
for you to go
and talk to someone else,

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.551
Mr. Big Bear
Riding a Bulldozer.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:13.888
Or maybe you could just <i> ferme</i>
your fucking <i> bouche</i>

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.590
for one second

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.625
and listen to Guy Lapointe.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.060
Hmm?

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:23.264
- Let me tell a story.
- Okay.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.631
I believe that two...

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.502
Can you come closer?

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.238
Can you come closer?

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:34.809
Closer, you... Can you come...
Can you come closer?

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:40.148
I believe
that two years back,

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.618
I met this son of a bitch.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.435
Ah, well!

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:03.304
Good afternoon to you, sir.
I am Guy Lapointe.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.974
Surete du Quebec.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:10.078
Oh! Did you come here
about the spider?

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.412
Hmm?

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:15.015
I called the police
two days ago

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:19.319
because there's
a big ol' spider
in my potty hole.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.921
Your "potty hole"?

01:09:20.924 --> 01:09:23.457
The shitter!

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:27.162
...Oh, I see.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:31.866
So you have some sort
of creepy crawler thing
in your toilet box?

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:35.870
Yes, he's a big ol'
brown recluse.

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.872
-Yeah. They call it
the hobo spider.
-Oh.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.975
And it's mean.
I called the police.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:43.178
And the lady
on the phone said to me,

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:47.381
"Oh, we'll send somebody
out in a few days."

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:49.617
Well, I have to regret...

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:53.220
Regretfully inform you
that I'm not the man.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:56.658
I'm not that man who was sent
by the lady who said
she was sending someone.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.293
I'm not him.

01:09:58.295 --> 01:09:59.994
You're not gonna
shoot the spider?

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:04.365
As an inspector
of the Surete du Quebec,
er...

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:09.337
I'm actually not authorized
to discharge a weapon...

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:12.040
- ...at a bug.
- Oh.

01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:14.576
One of the downsides
of the job.

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:17.812
But I come today
because I'm investigating...

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:22.483
Well, a disappearance.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:25.019
- Oh?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:28.489
The hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree,
from Quebec City.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.592
A lot of people
have heard of him.

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:34.896
I have even heard of him
once or twice
before all of this happened.

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:37.031
So, many people
have heard of him.

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:39.334
Have you heard of him perhaps?

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:42.070
- No.
- No.

01:10:42.072 --> 01:10:44.906
No. Well, last month,

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:48.543
he was drafted
by the New Nordiques.

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:51.279
Oh, well...
Piss on the New Nordiques!

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:54.249
Give me back my old Nordiques.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.917
I...

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.518
Do you know something, sir,

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.922
I truly respect
your, er, passion

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.558
for the game of the hockey.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.126
Huh?

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:08.596
So anyway, this hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree...

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:12.467
I guess he'd seen some
sort of advertisement

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:16.471
in a bar bathroom
that said, "We can give you
a place to live

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:20.441
"in a living situation
that's not far from here."

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.645
But somewhere between
here and Quebec City,

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:26.881
the hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree...

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:30.451
- Well, he went missing.
- Oh.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:34.956
And so I stopped by to see
if maybe you might have heard

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:39.060
or seen something
that was a little
out of the ordinary

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:42.597
the other night
on that Monday...
Monday night.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:45.733
Oh, no, not Monday night,
because I'm down at the rink.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:48.770
I'm down at the ice rink
Monday nights,
with the little mites.

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:51.572
Oh, do you coach
the hockey mites?

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:56.577
No, no, I'm not the coach.
No, no, I'm just the coach's
helper monkey, you know.

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:59.647
On Monday nights,
I come and I pick up
the sticks,

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:03.985
and I bring the little ones
water, you know,
during the drills,

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:05.353
- and all that.
- Uh-huh.

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:08.356
And then on Monday nights
we go out for poutine.

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:11.359
Have you ever been
to Poutine-ee Weeny,
on Rue de Jour?

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:15.463
Poutine really does not
agree with me.

01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:17.598
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- My innards...

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.335
It creates such a, er...

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:24.472
Poutine gives me
just the worst shits.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:29.277
I'm sorry to be
so crass about it
and everything.

01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:32.046
By the way, you know,
I didn't even get your name.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:34.682
Bartholomew Moseeay.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:38.052
You sure you don't have time
to come in and kill a spider?

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.855
You know, I would...
I swear to you
that I would help

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.458
- in any way that I could...
- Yeah.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.061
I would help,
but I'm really just a lowly
homicide detective

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.997
and I'm really not
paid enough to, er...

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:53.968
To deal with
the savage animals, you know.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.904
You know what I think,
Mr. Lapointe?

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:59.841
I think that the real
savage animals

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:02.577
are the human beings.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.314
Oh.

01:13:06.316 --> 01:13:08.850
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:12.220
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:14.355
- Thank you.
- Have a wonderful day, sir.

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:15.923
Thank you very much.

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:20.762
In all of the Canada,

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:23.831
there is no record...

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:28.035
Of a man named
Bartholomew Moseeay.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:32.774
There is no local rink,
there is no hockey mites.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:38.112
And I would also assume
that there is no
Poutine-ee Weeny.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:40.014
But ever since that day,

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:44.452
I've stopped
making the assumptions,
you know.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:50.124
The hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree...

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:53.094
He was probably
in that house, you know.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:57.031
And I was standing
on the porch,

01:13:57.033 --> 01:14:00.568
assuming that I was talking
to some harmless simpleton

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.703
who spoke funny.

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:04.705
But, um...

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:09.110
But one month later,
we find what is left

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:14.015
of the hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:20.955
His torso was blocking up
a sewer pipe
outside of Gatineau.

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:25.960
So...

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:33.134
The man-child,
Bartholomew Moseeay...

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:38.840
Or Howard Howe,
went poof!

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.909
Poof! Disappear.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.811
He disappeared.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.582
Do you want to know
what my theory is?

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:52.854
The theory that got me excused
from the Surete du Quebec?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.757
Please.

01:14:56.759 --> 01:15:02.630
All of the victims
have holes in the mouth.

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:07.502
He cuts off the legs,
he sews the arms...

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:13.274
But he puts something
in their mouths
that we don't get to see.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:15.176
Some of the cops were saying
that the holes

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.338
are from the meat hooks,
you know, if they...

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:22.350
They hang up the body,
while you use to rip it up,
the flesh and all that.

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.285
You know what I mean?

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.189
I beg to differ.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.226
- Well, what do you say?
- Ah, well...

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:35.162
The hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree,

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:38.633
the boy that I failed to save.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:41.636
Just like all the rest,
he had missing legs,

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:44.005
missing tongue, missing teeth,

01:15:44.007 --> 01:15:47.174
the hole in the roof
of the mouth.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:50.711
But the medical examiner,
he found something...

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:56.083
Inside the hole
of his mouth.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:06.027
It was a tiny piece of
the victim's own tibia bone.
No bigger than this.

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:08.663
So why would a piece
of his leg bone
be in his mouth?

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:11.399
Oh, I don't know.

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:17.204
So I go to see this mama
of the hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:19.607
And I say to her,
"You are the mama

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:22.777
"and you know the things
about the child.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:27.748
"You feel things that
no police or nobody can feel.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.485
"So, how do you think
your boy was killed?"

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:36.791
And the mama, she's...
She is crying, you know.

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:41.195
And now it is as if she is
like my own mama, you know.

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:47.401
And then the mama,
she say to me...

01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:50.037
She say to me...

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:57.945
"This man is making
a monster.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:01.616
<i>- "This man
is making a monster."</i>

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:04.051
Mr. Tusk...

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:06.854
Why do you blubber so?

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:11.726
Are you really mourning
your loss of humanity?

01:17:11.728 --> 01:17:14.295
I don't understand.

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:16.831
Who in the hell
would want to be human?

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.834
God almighty!

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:22.403
In all my travels,

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:30.344
I've only ever known a human
to be an ocean of shit.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.949
And my vessel lifts...

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:36.917
And is leaking.

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:45.326
I am so very tired,
Mr. Tusk.

01:17:49.599 --> 01:17:53.968
Battered by a life
of cruel fate...

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:57.505
And poor decisions.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:18:01.242
And the terrible
consequences of both.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:10.651
<i>¶ The water is wide</i>

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:17.425
<i>¶ And I dare not cross over</i>

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.363
<i>¶ Nor have I wings...</i>

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.802
<i>¶ Wings to fly</i>

01:18:30.907 --> 01:18:34.909
<i>¶ Build me a boat</i>

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:40.047
<i>¶ That can carry two</i>

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:49.156
<i>¶ And both shall row</i>

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:53.194
<i>¶ My love and I</i>

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.032
Oh.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.102
You must be
terribly hungry by now.

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:12.546
That is a mackerel.

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:19.587
Bon appetit, Monsieur Tusk.

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.746
Yes...

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:53.587
Now go to the fish, Mr. Tusk.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.193
Take the mackerel.

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.873
Feed.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.856
So this is nice
and very roomy for an economy.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:31.926
I should have rented
this model, I knew it.

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:34.962
-Did you pre-pay
for the gasoline?
-Uh, yeah.

01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:37.932
- So where do we go first?
- Now, where?

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.767
Where is for wolf.

01:20:39.769 --> 01:20:42.770
We look for the which.

01:20:42.772 --> 01:20:46.807
As in, which one of you
knows this missing podcaster
the best.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:48.108
I do.

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:50.678
- You do.
- Yeah.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.815
Okay, so on the phone message,
it said he was driving for,
like, two hours or something.

01:20:54.817 --> 01:20:58.986
So you know him best,
you know what he likes
to do when he drives,

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:02.356
because nobody
does nothing in a car.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.992
Does he smoke
the cigarettes,
does he chew the tobaccos

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:07.895
or toothpicks,
does he drink the coffee?

01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:09.697
Does he have some other thing?
I don't know.

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.866
Me, for example, all I do...

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:17.371
I cannot start the car without
having the double-double

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:21.141
with eight sugars
and just a dash of cream.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:23.544
So what we really need to do

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:28.249
is discern this podcaster's
ritual while he is driving.

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:34.855
He likes big, goofy
convenience store drinks.

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:42.563
Oh, my God!
It's Mr. Mustache.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:46.834
- Colleen! Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.971
Oh, my God, what?

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:54.508
No way! It's Mr. Mustache.

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:57.544
"Mr. Mustache"?

01:21:57.546 --> 01:22:01.348
No, it's not the room
I'm interested in as much
as you, Mr. Howe.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:04.785
Yeah, tonight would be...
That would be amazing, sir.
Yes. Thank you.

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:06.620
All right, where am I going?

01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:10.524
Bifrost? Sounds erotic.

01:22:10.526 --> 01:22:12.459
Okay, let me just ask
somebody how far I am.

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:15.262
Excuse me, hey!

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:16.964
How's everything
over at Degrassi, huh?

01:22:16.966 --> 01:22:19.133
You kids still getting
knocked up and shot at?

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.435
...What?

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.870
Degrassi!

01:22:22.872 --> 01:22:25.873
Never mind. Uh, how far
is Bifrost from here?

01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:27.875
Bifrost?
Shit! That's far.

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:29.476
Yeah, it's about two hours
from here.

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.712
Oh, God bless you,
generous angels.

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:33.814
Yeah, the kids here at
the convenience store

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:35.883
are telling me that it's
about two hours away.

01:22:35.885 --> 01:22:37.551
I hate American guys.

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:39.119
You sure that's not gonna be
too late for you, Mr. Howe?

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:42.489
Okay, awesome. Yeah.
What's your address?

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:44.758
Hang on one second, sir.
Hang on.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.260
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:48.429
Can you get off those
for one second
and give me a pen?

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:50.331
Sorry, sir.

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.799
Thank you. God bless you.

01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:53.233
You guys have pads here,
in Canada?

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:55.169
Anything to write on,
or you just write in the air?

01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:57.438
Hashtag thanks.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.506
Hey, I'm just gonna go ahead
and write on ya.

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:02.142
Okay, shoot, Mr. Howe. Yeah.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.612
Great. Got it.

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:08.115
And I'm gonna leave
right now, so I'll see you
in about two hours.

01:23:08.117 --> 01:23:11.418
Good. Okay, bye now.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.655
- How much do I owe you?

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:20.861
That's me?
That's my mustache?

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:24.498
"Yep! I'm American.
How are things over
at Degrassi High?"

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.068
"Do you ladies know
where Bifrost is? Uh, duh!"

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:30.838
You guys suck.

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:35.776
So this pad of paper
that he borrowed
to write down the address,

01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:38.818
I would like for you
to give it to me, please,
if you would.

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.315
Give him the pad.

01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:42.950
You give him the pad.

01:23:42.952 --> 01:23:44.485
Give him the pad!

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:46.987
One of you
must give me the pad now.

01:23:46.989 --> 01:23:51.992
I thank you very much.
Do you have a pencil?

01:23:51.994 --> 01:23:53.560
Thank you very much.

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:01.802
You see that?

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:04.705
Wow...

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:07.174
That's amazing.

01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:09.576
They did it in
<i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:13.313
Do you know, that's exactly
where I learned it from.
Isn't that weird?

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:14.548
Okay.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:27.528
Yeah. Isn't this soothing
to the soul?

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.434
You know,
if I close my eyes,

01:24:33.436 --> 01:24:36.870
I can almost imagine me
back on Ponder Rock,

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:40.874
I knew peace in this
twisted, hateful world.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:45.779
I miss our little paradise,
Mr. Tusk.

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:50.084
This is just a poor facsimile
of that magical enclave

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:52.286
where we first became
good friends.

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:54.755
Remember?

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.593
Until that...

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:02.529
Terrible day.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:09.436
<i>Man feeds on the meat
and sinew of the helpless.</i>

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:14.408
<i>-Until we are all...</i>

01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:15.542
<i>...alone.</i>

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.880
<i>We survive at all costs.</i>

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.816
<i>Only to butcher again.</i>

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.586
<i>And again.</i>

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:31.125
<i>Until we ourselves</i>
<i>are at last butchered</i>
<i>in turn.</i>

01:25:32.928 --> 01:25:36.563
You were not prepared
for me last time, Mr. Tusk.

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:38.832
You were not ready
for the fight.

01:25:38.834 --> 01:25:40.801
This time
it will be different.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.804
Because I have hardened you...

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.373
Just to show you...

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:50.644
How cruel man can be.

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:20.340
And if I truly brought out
the walrus in you...

01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:27.247
...this time,
you just might prevail.

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:32.719
Less than a kilometer
from Mile Marker 9...

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.055
- Yeah, the plates match.
- I'm going...

01:26:35.057 --> 01:26:37.491
No, no, he's not there.
I promise you he's not there.

01:26:37.493 --> 01:26:40.360
But he is close.

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.832
So...

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:48.969
We are about
to find your friend.

01:26:48.971 --> 01:26:51.371
And the dangerous man
who took him.

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:56.009
These are guns.

01:26:56.011 --> 01:26:57.110
I don't want one.

01:26:58.146 --> 01:26:59.846
You don't want a gun?

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:01.682
You take 'em.

01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:04.484
What...
What kind of American are you?

01:27:04.486 --> 01:27:05.652
The kind that has never
used a gun before.

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:07.321
Take the fuckin' gun!

01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:09.590
Yes, take the fuckin' gun,
please.

01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:12.125
I'll take the big one.

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:14.928
Yeah.

01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:21.034
Some years back,
I was rescued from the island
of Ponder Rock

01:27:21.036 --> 01:27:24.905
a mere hour
after I had butchered
my sweet savior walrus

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:27.608
in order to live.

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:31.111
I've marked this occasion
for 15 years now

01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:33.947
by allowing
my flippered friend

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:36.183
the fighting chance
he never had.

01:27:36.185 --> 01:27:37.718
So...

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.355
You will fight me, Mr. Walrus!

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:44.124
Or you will die!

01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:03.377
Wallace!

01:28:03.379 --> 01:28:05.112
Wallace!

01:28:21.163 --> 01:28:24.231
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

01:28:24.233 --> 01:28:27.167
So just as I had to kill you
on the rock,

01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:30.170
you have a terrible
choice to make here.

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:34.574
You have to kill me
if you want to live.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.577
And if you live,

01:28:37.579 --> 01:28:41.982
you will be as a walrus
that you almost are.

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.283
So...

01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:46.119
Either you go full walrus...

01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:48.922
...Or this!

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.933
Oh, what the fuck?

01:28:59.935 --> 01:29:03.203
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Wallace!

01:29:03.205 --> 01:29:05.672
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.810
You have lasted
longer than the rest.

01:29:09.812 --> 01:29:11.378
You'd kill me if you could.

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:15.148
You want to.

01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:18.819
Your survival instincts
have kicked in.

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:32.999
But so have mine!

01:29:46.415 --> 01:29:49.316
Where is it coming from?

01:29:49.318 --> 01:29:50.917
- Behind the wall!
- Wallace!

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:52.352
- He's behind the wall!
- Wallace!

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:55.355
- Ally, there's give.
- Stand back!

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:13.206
It is accomplished.

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.077
You are my...

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:21.448
Mr. Tusk.

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.630
Wallace...

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:44.604
No!

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:57.651
Wallace!

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.086
No! No!

01:31:35.624 --> 01:31:38.191
No, don't murder him. Please.
Leave him alone.

01:31:38.193 --> 01:31:39.960
Stop!

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.084
Wallace!

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.056
We're here.

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:51.064
It's Ally.

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:54.200
And Teddy.

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.109
The treat.

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.342
You don't have to hide
from us, Wallace.

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:35.809
Wallace!

01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:49.623
<i>I can't even remember</i>
<i>the last time you cried while</i>
<i>watching</i> Winnie the Pooh.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:51.491
So I don't cry,
I mean, big deal!

01:33:51.493 --> 01:33:53.760
I'm also a lot older,
remember?

01:33:53.762 --> 01:33:55.228
Crying's kind of for babies.

01:33:56.764 --> 01:34:00.066
I remember when
my grandma died and...

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:04.237
My grandpa was destroyed.

01:34:04.239 --> 01:34:07.107
He had tears
streaming down his face,

01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:09.643
he was holding her picture,
and I was so worried.

01:34:11.013 --> 01:34:14.948
I used to say...

01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:16.850
What's that?

01:34:16.852 --> 01:34:19.252
Don't cry.

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:21.354
And he would say,
"No, Juanita."

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:26.526
"It's good to cry.

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:30.397
"It separates us
from the animals.

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.600
"It shows you have a soul."

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:47.013
I love you, Wallace.

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.750
Don't ever forget that.

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:09.069
It's all right.

01:35:09.071 --> 01:35:10.403
Come on.

01:38:59.366 --> 01:39:01.534
<i>Welcome to Smodcast.
I'm Kevin Smith.</i>

01:39:01.536 --> 01:39:03.236
<i>- I'm Scott Mosier.
- Oh, shit!</i>

01:39:03.238 --> 01:39:05.038
<i>All right,
so here's the third act.</i>

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.440
<i>He then goes
and puts on his suit,</i>

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:09.475
<i>you know, made of human skins.</i>

01:39:09.477 --> 01:39:11.978
<i>And so you realize
he's done this before.</i>

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.647
<i>-Like, I'm not the first</i>
<i>lodger and shit like that.</i>
<i>Gotcha.</i>

01:39:14.649 --> 01:39:16.983
<i>So he's in it,
you're in yours,</i>

01:39:16.985 --> 01:39:21.321
<i>and you guys have to have</i>
<i>one of them walrus fights,</i>
<i>like on the beach.</i>

01:39:21.323 --> 01:39:24.624
<i>Where you slam each other,
going...</i>

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:31.297
<i>And we started saying,</i>
<i>"Is man indeed</i>
<i>a walrus at heart?"</i>

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:38.237
<i>You ultimately get him
and...</i>

01:39:38.239 --> 01:39:41.441
<i>But then what has to</i>
<i>happen at the end is that</i>
<i>once he makes that switch...</i>

01:39:41.443 --> 01:39:43.343
<i>- Yeah.
- ...he can't go back.</i>

01:39:43.345 --> 01:39:45.645
<i>Like the clinic</i>
<i>for the criminally insane</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:47.280
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

01:39:47.282 --> 01:39:49.415
<i>And you see,
you know, like, his buddy...</i>

01:39:49.417 --> 01:39:51.284
<i>He's got something
wrapped in a newspaper</i>

01:39:51.286 --> 01:39:53.486
<i>-and you don't know</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:57.623
<i>It's a fish.
Oh, that's awesome.</i>

01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:01.594
<i>And it is... It's like
another walrus enclave.</i>

01:40:01.596 --> 01:40:03.997
<i>A better version
of where he was.</i>

01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:07.266
<i>-Because he realized they</i>
<i>can't reverse the process.</i>
<i>No, they can't.</i>

01:40:07.268 --> 01:40:10.436
<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>Even in his head,</i>
<i>he's gone full walrus.</i>

01:40:10.438 --> 01:40:12.338
<i>You're right.</i>

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.844
<i>And he</i>
<i>throws him the fish,</i>
<i>and then, fuckin'...</i>

01:40:17.846 --> 01:40:23.349
<i>The walrus-man</i>
<i>scurries over to it</i>
<i>all gross and shit,</i>

01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:25.685
<i>and starts biting at it
on the ground.</i>

01:40:25.687 --> 01:40:28.287
<i>They play, like,
some sad piano music.</i>

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:30.556
<i>Roll credits as we pull back
in this overhead,</i>

01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:33.726
<i>watching him fuckin' eating
this fish off the ground.</i>

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:38.364
<i>And there's a song
that's just like...</i>

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:41.868
<i>¶ Being tender
in your heart!</i>

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:50.076
<i>- Is that a real song?
- No!</i>

01:40:50.078 --> 01:40:51.411
<i>Like, we need
a hashtag for this.</i>

01:40:51.413 --> 01:40:53.246
<i>The conversation
needs to grow.</i>

01:40:53.248 --> 01:40:55.014
<i>Two hashtags.</i>

01:40:55.016 --> 01:40:58.317
<i>Walrus yes, walrus no.</i>

01:40:58.319 --> 01:41:00.053
<i>Oh, for people</i>
<i>who don't want it?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:41:00.055 --> 01:41:01.854
<i>Your vote is crucial.</i>

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:28.581
You just had
to have the second slider.

01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:32.085
You just had to have
