WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:13.147
[roaring on TV]

00:13.181 --> 00:15.649
[both gasping]

00:15.683 --> 00:18.452
Frankenstein vs. Snakes 3D

00:18.486 --> 00:22.590
is the best monster
vs. snakes movie ever.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.459
It's the best movie ever
because we stole it
out of Justin's room.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.229
[both laugh]

00:32.700 --> 00:35.603
Hey, Alex, check it out.
Justin's in 3D, too.

00:35.636 --> 00:40.208
Oh, so ugly. It's like
right in front of me.

00:40.241 --> 00:44.678
Those are my 3D glasses.
That is my rare copy of
 Frankenstein vs. Snakes.

00:44.712 --> 00:48.649
Off. And, hey! Those are
my wheat-free breadsticks!

00:48.682 --> 00:51.352
Now, I don't have
a snack that's not
gonna slow me down.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.390
You're always sneaking
in my room and taking stuff,
and I'm sick of it.

00:56.424 --> 01:00.561
And you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna Alex-proof my room.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.431
Again? Well, go ahead.

01:03.464 --> 01:07.067
Your door of flames
worked out great for me.
Watching your eyebrows smoke?

01:07.101 --> 01:08.702
Hilarious.

01:10.671 --> 01:14.575
Ooh, this is so great.
I don't know whose
side to be on.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.378
- I pick Alex.
- I'm not worried about it.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.047
You'll come to my side
as soon as you hear
something you like.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.685
- No, I won't.
- Want to be my lab assistant
while I Alex-proof my room?

01:24.718 --> 01:29.123
Assistant?
I am switching sides!

01:29.157 --> 01:31.659
- What?
- Sorry, Alex.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.727
I might get
to wear a lab coat.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.233
gonna be a breeze *
 * Well, you know everything's

01:39.267 --> 01:41.202
* That the end will no doubt
 justify the means *

01:41.235 --> 01:43.604
* You can fix any problem
 with the slightest of ease *

01:43.637 --> 01:44.838
* Yes, please

01:44.872 --> 01:46.640
it'll go to your head *
 * But you might find out

01:46.674 --> 01:48.609
* When you write a report
 on a book you never read *

01:48.642 --> 01:50.844
* With the snap of your fingers
 you can make your bed *

01:50.878 --> 01:52.646
* That's what I said

01:52.680 --> 01:56.083
* Everything is not
 what it seems *

01:56.116 --> 01:59.587
* When you can get all you
 wanted in your wildest dreams *

01:59.620 --> 02:03.657
* You might run into trouble
 if you go to extremes *

02:03.691 --> 02:08.262
* Because everything
 is not what it seems *

02:08.295 --> 02:11.465
* Everything is not
 what it seems *

02:11.499 --> 02:15.669
* When you can have what you
 want by the simplest of means *

02:15.703 --> 02:19.106
* Be careful not to mess
 with the balance of things *

02:19.139 --> 02:23.344
* Because everything is not

02:23.377 --> 02:25.279
* What it seems *

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
Get the brain
from the wizard brain store?

02:41.662 --> 02:45.633
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did, master.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.701
What's with the
weird Yoda impression?

02:48.869 --> 02:51.372
- Give me the brain.
- Fine.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.708
I got a great deal on it.
You know,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.577
left to get me
And I had enough wizard money

02:56.610 --> 02:59.179
that has my name on it.
this cool key chain

02:59.213 --> 03:01.382
That says "Dan."

03:01.415 --> 03:05.519
really fast, it looks like Max.
Yeah, I know. But if you move it

03:07.755 --> 03:10.691
Max! Dude...

03:10.724 --> 03:13.160
it's hamburger meat.
This isn't the brain,

03:13.193 --> 03:18.299
a great deal on the key chain.
OK, so I didn't get such

03:18.332 --> 03:19.800
It cost all
the money you gave me.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.340
Go stand guard in the hall
while I figure this out, Max.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.676
Yeah. But it's gonna take
me a while to figure out

03:28.709 --> 03:32.646
the flashlight
on this thing.
Oh, there it is. Got it.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.795
[drill whirring]

03:51.932 --> 03:54.568
Max, get in here!

03:56.470 --> 03:59.340
Yo! Justin, check it out.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.310
I found this raisin
by the mouse hole.
Wanna split it?

04:03.677 --> 04:07.648
Wait a second.
That might be poop.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.351
I've done it.
I've done it!

04:10.384 --> 04:12.686
I've created something
that will keep Alex
out of my room.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.423
For good.
I give you...

04:16.390 --> 04:18.358
...FrankenGirl!

04:21.562 --> 04:26.734
We just need a small electrical
charge to bring her to life.
Hand me those circus balloons.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.502
- These?
- Yes.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.372
The blue one.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.775
Thank you.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.952
Not enough electricity.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.855
I know a spell.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.491
OK.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.761
We need electricity
 and a lot

04:53.794 --> 04:56.764
Give me 1.21 gigawatts

04:58.799 --> 05:01.469
[gasping]
That's good!

05:01.502 --> 05:03.070
Enough electricity.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.314
Buggle!

05:17.751 --> 05:19.753
She's alive!

05:19.787 --> 05:20.854
She's alive!

05:20.888 --> 05:24.525
She's alive!

05:27.327 --> 05:32.933
I have melded magic
with technology to create life!

05:34.768 --> 05:38.639
Your name is FrankenGirl.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.842
Your mission in life
is to capture Alex

05:41.875 --> 05:44.878
when she enters my room.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.816
As you wish.
That is my mission.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.418
Perfect.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.856
Cool key chain.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.829
[moaning]

06:03.363 --> 06:05.399
Hey, you want a raisin?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.936
Poop.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.506
Good!

06:20.113 --> 06:22.550
We need to make a list of
extracurriculars for you.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.351
They look good
on college applications.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.622
Well, does sneaking
into Justin's room look good
on an application?

06:28.656 --> 06:30.958
If you're applying to prison.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.997
- How'd it go?
- Not good. I don't know what
we're gonna do with her.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.899
Ooh, I know what
you could do with her.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.369
Buy her a mini-fridge
and send her to her room.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.640
We could take the old
nightstand and put ice
in the drawers. And then...

06:47.875 --> 06:51.545
She has to go to college
and move out. She has to.

06:51.579 --> 06:55.583
Um... Alex, honey,
I think what your mother
is trying to explain

06:55.616 --> 06:58.919
is that your graduation day
is gonna be a day
that we all celebrate

06:58.952 --> 07:03.724
for different reasons
and in different ways.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.960
OK. Good talk.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.863
- Jerry!
- No. You know what?

07:09.897 --> 07:13.601
I was gonna surprise you guys,
but since you're all on my back

07:13.634 --> 07:19.006
about my extracurr-ackulars,
I will just...
I will just tell you.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.443
I joined Book Club.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.646
And I finished Book Club.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.450
Are you sure you didn't
mean Comic Book Club?

07:30.484 --> 07:35.489
Yeah. No, no.
They even gave me an award
for reading the most books.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.758
You understand
that I'm proud of you,

07:37.791 --> 07:41.895
and you also understand
because you're you,
I'm gonna need proof.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.965
Of course, Daddy.
One award, coming up.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.771
All right. I need an award,
so let's go to Justin's room.

07:50.804 --> 07:55.008
Hey, Alex,
I'm on your side again.
Justin insulted me.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.512
He got all mad because
I got hamburger meat
for his monster's brains.

07:58.546 --> 08:03.016
An Alex-proofing monster
with a meatloaf brain?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.151
Come on!

08:07.921 --> 08:11.892
- Let's just get the trophy
and get out of here.
- Don't worry.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.827
We'll take care
of the monster first.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.029
Where would a monster
with meat for brains hide?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.898
Over here!

08:17.931 --> 08:19.533
[screaming]

08:19.567 --> 08:21.935
[continues screaming]

08:21.969 --> 08:25.873
- [grunting]
- [screaming]

08:27.074 --> 08:29.610
Sorry, Alex.
I faint when I'm scared,

08:29.643 --> 08:32.245
but I'm also scared of fainting,
so then I wake up.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.916
[growling] I capture Alex
in Justin's room!

08:35.948 --> 08:38.619
[screaming]

08:40.621 --> 08:42.990
Sounds like my
monster trap has sprung.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.092
Nice, dude.
I'm on your side now.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.829
- Weren't you
always on my side?
- Up until that question.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.165
- [screaming]
- Harper, do not
look at the monster.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.968
- You'll faint again.
- OK. OK. I'm just
gonna keep my eyes shut,

08:55.002 --> 08:57.805
keep looking for the trophy
and let's get out of here.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.508
[grunting]

09:01.541 --> 09:04.878
- I found the trophy!
- Harper,
that's not the trophy.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.581
That's the meatloaf brain
that Max...

09:07.615 --> 09:09.182
Wait a minute.

09:09.216 --> 09:13.887
If that's in there...
what's in there?

09:13.921 --> 09:17.625
I don't know what
you're looking at.
My eyes are closed.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.596
I have motherboard
60840 for brain.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.565
He put his
old laptop in there.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.134
So your brain
thinks like a computer?

09:27.167 --> 09:32.172
[grunting]

09:32.205 --> 09:35.142
OK. I'm gonna
take that as a yes. Um...

09:35.175 --> 09:37.778
Can you just
give me one second?
OK. Psst.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.546
Come here.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.982
What's that thing you do to
quit something on a computer?

09:42.015 --> 09:44.985
Oh! You hit the control,
alt and delete keys.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.188
Right. Uh, hey, FrankenGirl.

09:48.221 --> 09:52.926
Since you kind of have us
trapped in here, we're sort of,
like, totally under your...

09:52.960 --> 09:56.930
- Control?
- Yes.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.166
Now, here's
a little brainteaser for you.

09:59.199 --> 10:03.771
What's a delicious ice cream
drink without an "M"?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.138
[grunts]

10:11.078 --> 10:12.612
Alt?

10:13.747 --> 10:16.049
I was gonna say, "Ilkshake."

10:20.788 --> 10:23.023
And now, I'd like you
to say the word "delete."

10:23.056 --> 10:26.593
Delete.
That wasn't so...

10:26.626 --> 10:30.130
- Wait a minute.
- [beeping,
 machinery winding down]

10:30.163 --> 10:33.000
Thank you very much.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.903
This will work
as a Book Club trophy.
Let's get out of here.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.071
A-ha!

10:38.105 --> 10:39.272
No!

10:41.809 --> 10:44.712
Nice Alex-proofing, Justin.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.148
But it looks like
I finished Book Club.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.752
I am on your side now.
What can I say?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.821
I love a winner.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.289
OK, Alex.
It's payback time.

10:56.323 --> 11:00.694
You want to come in my room
and take things?
Well, here you go.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.329
Bring FrankenGirl
 back to alive

11:02.362 --> 11:05.165
You're Alex's BFF
 and that's no jive

11:05.198 --> 11:06.767
Hey, nanny nanny
 Ha cha cha

11:06.800 --> 11:09.069
[beeping]

11:09.102 --> 11:11.204
[growling]

11:11.238 --> 11:14.107
Best friend forever.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.212
- Take that, Alex.
- Nice try, Justin.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.181
Say, "Control, alt, delete."

11:21.214 --> 11:23.183
Control. Alt. Delete.

11:23.216 --> 11:27.721
A-ha. You know the "Hey,
nanny nanny, ha cha cha" part?

11:27.755 --> 11:31.892
- That was a spell lock.
- [FrankenGirl laughs]

11:31.925 --> 11:35.796
We need to make friendship
totally stronger.
Let's share secrets.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.198
Mine is that
I'm a chocoholic.

11:38.231 --> 11:42.302
I love it,
but it goes straight
to my forehead.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.207
- Now, you go.
- OK, here's mine.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.076
This ain't really
working out for me.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.144
Slumber party!

12:01.221 --> 12:03.824
[FrankenGirl laughing]

12:07.127 --> 12:09.696
We're good BFFs.
Let's share secrets.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.066
[laughing] This arm
belonged to a seamstress.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.902
[laughing]

12:16.937 --> 12:20.908
Good morning, Alex.
You guys look adorable.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.012
Dude, I am
definitely on your side.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.281
No thanks, dude.
You can't keep switching
sides. You're done.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.919
All right. Fine.
Then I'm on Alex's side.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.987
No, no, no.
You're not on my side either.

12:34.021 --> 12:38.425
What? No side?
No, I can't be side-less.

12:38.458 --> 12:43.797
- I gotta find a side.
- Keep walking, shorty.
[laughs]

12:47.835 --> 12:49.970
Well, come on, Alex.
It's time to go to school.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.273
OK. Well, FrankenGirl, go
upstairs and get our sweaters.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.276
- Not the matching ones.
- [chuckles]

12:56.309 --> 12:58.979
No. I see what you're doing.
You're using the sweater delay

12:59.012 --> 13:02.816
so you don't bring
FrankenGirl to school. After I
leave, you'll just stay here.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.152
It'll work because you can't
bear to be late for school.

13:05.185 --> 13:09.056
I thought you might
think of that. Mom! Dad!
Come down from upstairs!

13:09.089 --> 13:11.825
Come on, everybody.
Gonna be late.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.494
It's Manhattan Walk Your
Child to School Day.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.998
There's no such thing
as Manhattan Walk Your
Child to School Day.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.834
Yes, there is.
Justin showed us on his laptop.

13:20.868 --> 13:24.204
And if it's on a computer,
it's gotta be true. Let's go!

13:24.237 --> 13:28.075
OK. We better hurry up
because I walk fast! Go!

13:29.109 --> 13:31.044
Alex, wait up.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.922
Nicely played, Justin,
but look around.

13:41.955 --> 13:45.025
I am in school
and there's no FrankenGirl.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.061
- [FrankenGirl growling]
- Nice try, Justin.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.497
Make the little "grrr" noises
to freak me out.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.433
Oh, gosh!

13:53.466 --> 13:56.203
You forgot your sweater.
[laughs]

13:58.105 --> 14:01.574
Revenge is so... cozy.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.813
How did you find out
what school I go to?

14:06.846 --> 14:10.050
Funny story. I got list
of all schools in New York.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.085
But then I realized,
with my luck,

14:12.119 --> 14:14.554
you would be in
last school I looked in,

14:14.587 --> 14:19.126
so I just went
to last school. [laughs]

14:25.933 --> 14:28.035
[crashing]

14:28.068 --> 14:31.604
- [laughing]
- [laughing]

14:34.374 --> 14:35.943
That was nice.

14:37.477 --> 14:41.881
Miss Russo, Max tells me
you have a new friend.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.984
I'm on his side now.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.287
Right, um...

14:47.320 --> 14:52.159
She's actually a new student.
And her name is Frankie Stein.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.628
- [laughing]
- Frankie Stein.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.032
That's a grip that
could hogtie a steer.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.168
Funny.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.371
The office didn't
mention any new students.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.174
This isn't one of your schemes,
is it, Miss Russo?

15:09.909 --> 15:14.047
See, this is the part
where I pretend I don't
know what schemes means.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.084
And then you pull
out a dictionary
and make me look it up.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.619
And... Let's just
go to your office.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.990
Friend of Alex
is friend of mine.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.126
Let's share secrets.
[laughs]

15:26.159 --> 15:27.427
OK.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.466
[whispering] I don't
have a college degree.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.638
Whoo!

15:38.671 --> 15:40.640
That sure lightened
the spiritual load.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.477
Thanks. Shh...

15:48.081 --> 15:52.052
Wow! Nice save.

15:52.085 --> 15:56.256
Destruction of property,
getting me out of trouble.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.626
I've got a secret.
I like you.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.996
But don't tell Justin.
Wait.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.432
- We should tell Justin.
- [laughs]

16:09.002 --> 16:11.104
Hey, Justin, check this out.
In biology class,

16:11.138 --> 16:14.441
when they passed out frogs
for us to dissect, she ate it.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.145
[laughs] Good.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.681
How embarrassing for you.
You got an F.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.485
No, it was hilarious. I mean,
I was gonna get an F, anyway.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.387
I had mine on a stick, dancing.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.390
[laughing]

16:30.423 --> 16:35.262
Oh. The nerd store called
and they want your face back.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.397
[both laughing]

16:37.430 --> 16:40.200
Of course.
I make her your BFF,

16:40.233 --> 16:43.103
she's gonna make
fun of me, too. Great.

16:43.136 --> 16:47.240
Yep. Looks like your revenge...

16:47.274 --> 16:50.277
...revunged.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.145
Oh, come on. "Revunged?"

16:52.179 --> 16:54.714
Look it up.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.118
[laughing]

17:07.127 --> 17:09.296
Hey, guys. Hey.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.464
Since it's all,
um, working out here,

17:12.499 --> 17:15.468
here's something that
looks like it would be fun.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.406
- Cheerleading tryouts.
- Yeah, well, good luck
with that, Justin.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.208
I'm sure you'll
look great in a skirt.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.041
[both laughing]

17:23.076 --> 17:26.613
Hey, hey. Let's go wreck stuff
that's too high for me to reach.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.752
Alex doesn't
 think cheerleading's cool

17:32.785 --> 17:35.255
Make FrankenGirl
 a cheerleading fool

17:39.292 --> 17:42.762
Alex, I want to go to
cheerleader tryouts.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.198
Good idea.
Let's go make fun of them.

17:45.232 --> 17:49.068
No! No.
I want to be cheerleader.

17:49.102 --> 17:52.239
Yeah, and I wanna
graduate in four years,
but it's not gonna happen.

17:52.272 --> 17:56.243
No! I want to be cheerleader!

17:56.276 --> 18:00.313
[grunting]
I want to be cheerleader!

18:06.319 --> 18:08.455
And if I may...

18:08.488 --> 18:11.791
You know what's even better
than being a cheerleader,
FrankenGirl?

18:11.824 --> 18:16.763
Being a cheerleader
with your friend.
Now, that is total BFF stuff.

18:16.796 --> 18:21.268
Come on, Alex.
We be cheerleaders together.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.370
I think you're
the real monster.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.311
- Harper?
- Alex? [screams]

18:32.245 --> 18:33.813
Ah!

18:33.846 --> 18:35.782
[panting]
What are you doing here?

18:35.815 --> 18:39.286
- What are you doing here?
- I asked you first.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.189
- OK, I'm a cheerleader.
- I'm your best friend.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.424
How could I not know
that you were a cheerleader?

18:44.457 --> 18:47.394
Let's see. You've
never been to an assembly
or a basketball game.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.297
The only time you're
here after school is
when you have to be here,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.599
if you know what
I'm trying to say.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.535
Detention.
There, I said it.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.771
I am so hurt that you
would keep this from me.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.640
Friends aren't supposed
to keep secrets.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.875
Oh! [whispers]
Wizard.

19:02.909 --> 19:07.514
Wow! Wow, someone's not ever
gonna let that one go, are they?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.352
Well, I think it's great
that you're a cheerleader.

19:12.385 --> 19:16.356
Because you can
keep FrankenGirl busy

19:16.389 --> 19:20.460
- while I sneak out.
- OK, ladies.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.764
Miss Sauberman and I are here to
judge this year's prize heifers.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.437
Sorry. Some of these western
phrases don't translate so well.

19:30.470 --> 19:34.607
Miss Russo, you're trying
out for cheerleading?

19:34.641 --> 19:37.444
Not exactly the extracurricular
I'd expect from you.

19:37.477 --> 19:42.582
Oh, but she's gonna do it.
Isn't that right, Frankie?

19:42.615 --> 19:44.183
[laughing]

19:45.485 --> 19:49.422
- Aw!
- OK, Justin. You win.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.858
I won't sneak
into your room again
and take anything.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.228
I actually believe you.

19:55.262 --> 19:58.365
But you're still
gonna try out.
Mr. Laritate, she's ready!

19:59.466 --> 20:01.368
Harper, get the girls ready.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.802
All right, buddy up!

20:02.835 --> 20:05.305
[FrankenGirl laughing]

20:05.838 --> 20:08.375
[cheering]

20:08.408 --> 20:11.378
All right. So this is some
of your basic steps.
Now, let's do this.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.214
Ready? OK!

20:15.248 --> 20:18.651
- [dance music plays]
- [Harper] One, two,
three, four,

20:18.685 --> 20:19.986
five, six, seven, eight!

20:29.896 --> 20:32.265
[gobbling] Go Turkeys!

20:35.368 --> 20:37.470
- [girl yelling]
- [screaming]

20:47.514 --> 20:48.648
Oh!

20:52.585 --> 20:55.888
- Ouch!
- She's cut.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.493
And... spirit!

21:08.401 --> 21:11.471
Well, Justin, I don't know
how you did it, but it's true.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.606
You got Alex to join
an extracurricular.

21:13.640 --> 21:18.378
As soon as she found out
her best friends were doing it,
she couldn't say no.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.314
Oh, you really
are the perfect son.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.487
- Here's some cash for snacks.
- I love you.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.924
[announcer] A big hand
 for what's left
 of our J.V. Cheer Squad!

21:31.958 --> 21:34.594
Harper Finkel!

21:34.627 --> 21:36.529
- [cheering]
- Yeah! Whoo!

21:37.464 --> 21:39.532
Ow! Yeah!

21:39.566 --> 21:42.969
New transfer student,
 Frankie Stein!

21:43.002 --> 21:46.473
[cheering]

21:49.576 --> 21:51.878
And... Alex Russo?

21:51.911 --> 21:56.849
- [cheering]
- Yeah!

21:56.883 --> 21:59.552
[Justin] That's my sister!

21:59.586 --> 22:01.721
Let's just get
this over with, OK?

22:01.754 --> 22:03.823
[dance music plays]

22:08.595 --> 22:10.563
[cheering]

22:11.964 --> 22:14.601
- Here we go again.
- [grunting]

22:16.035 --> 22:19.606
- [crashing]
- [Alex screaming]

22:21.340 --> 22:23.576
[laughing]

22:32.051 --> 22:35.555
[Alex] I might be
a little late to algebra.
