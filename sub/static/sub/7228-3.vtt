[Emmie] You snore too much.
[Doc] No, I don't snore.
You snore.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.149
You two were up giggling
awfully late last night.

yawn, too.

01:40.850 --> 01:41.893
Uh!

01:41.976 --> 01:45.271
I poured orange juice
in my cereal by accident!

01:45.855 --> 01:47.482
Oh, no!
Orange juice?

01:47.565 --> 01:50.068
See what happens
when you don't
get enough sleep?

01:50.151 --> 01:52.779
It's hard to think clearly
the next day.

Too spacey
for one more tea party

02:04.374 --> 02:05.458
No way!

02:05.792 --> 02:09.169
[English accent] Daddy,
would you like to join
our tea party?

02:09.253 --> 02:11.756

Oh, that sounds lovely.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.135
We're ready to begin.

Sorry.

Who wants some tea?

Oh, me, me!

Here you are,

I can do better than that.

Oh, Stuffy.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.185
Oh, Doc?

03:47.268 --> 03:49.437
[Lambie] May I
have some tea, too?
[groans]

03:49.646 --> 03:50.772
Of course.

03:50.855 --> 03:54.067
Now, do be a lamb,
pass your cup over here.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.862
Now, Stuffy,
this is the proper
way to drink tea.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.199
Sippity-sip-sip.
Ahh. See?

04:01.282 --> 04:02.659
[Stuffy]
So, like this?

04:03.159 --> 04:06.829
Sip, sip, sippity sip?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.373
[slurps loudly]

04:08.915 --> 04:11.209
[giggles] Stuffy!
[Stuffy grunts]

04:11.542 --> 04:15.088
And Susie Sunshine,
would you like to
join us for some tea?

04:15.171 --> 04:18.966
No! I don't
want any tea.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.093
Whoa!
Hey! Whoa!

04:21.010 --> 04:22.053
Susie?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.348
Hey, where's my cup?

04:27.850 --> 04:30.937
[giggles] Let's all try
taking another sip.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.397
No.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.651
But, uh, Susie Sunshine,
you love tea parties.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.112
Not today I don't.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.239
Maybe you need a cuddle.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.117
I don't want to cuddle.
Oh.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.036
Susie Sunshine,
are you okay?

04:48.037 --> 04:50.164
You're not acting
like yourself today.

04:50.248 --> 04:54.877
Yeah. You're usually
so giggly and happy
and... full of sunshine.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.839
I don't know,
but it's true.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.049
I don't feel happy today.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.176
I think you need
a check-up.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.805
Oh, I don't feel
like having a check-up.

05:06.264 --> 05:09.434
Susie, I can't
help you feel better
until you have one.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.603
[groans] Okay. Fine.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.896
Great!

05:15.982 --> 05:18.067
Dad, I'll be
in the back yard.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.406
The Doc is in.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.872
Oh!

05:31.539 --> 05:34.042
Oh! Susie Sunshine!

05:34.125 --> 05:37.253
That's just what we need
to brighten up our day.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.796
Give us a giggle, sugar.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.007
I don't feel
like giggling.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.341
Oh, my.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.219
Susie's not feeling
like herself today.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.804
I can see that.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.558
[whispering]
She didn't even want
to play tea party.

05:50.641 --> 05:51.893
This is serious.

05:51.976 --> 05:55.229

can put a smile back

What's weird?

Stuffy, Lambie,

06:41.651 --> 06:44.278
you can't stand
on the scale while
I'm weighing Susie.

is perfect

that's a good sign.
Why don't you hop up here.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.876
I'm going
to check your ears.

for me?

07:06.384 --> 07:07.385
[inhales]

07:07.885 --> 07:09.220
And let it out.

and I yawn.

07:30.908 --> 07:31.951
Hmm.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.162
Yawning.
Very interesting.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.581
Susie, why don't
you lie back?

07:39.375 --> 07:41.127
Hmm. That's funny.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.295
What's funny?

07:42.712 --> 07:45.548
Nothing seems funny
to me right now.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.842
Susie,
will you sit up again?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.261
Okay.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.181
Now lie back again.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.807
Oh, again?

07:55.933 --> 07:58.144
Susie,
you gotta trust Doc.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.606
If she's asking you
to do something,
there's a reason,

08:01.689 --> 08:04.275
even if no one
has any idea

08:04.358 --> 08:06.402
what it could
possibly be,

08:06.486 --> 08:09.864
and it seems
like it's pretty,
um, wonky-loo,

08:09.947 --> 08:11.449
you just gotta do it.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.452
Okay. Okay!
I'll do it.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.580
There. Did you see that?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.165
I totally saw it.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.126
So what was it again?

08:22.460 --> 08:24.629
[Doc] Susie's eyes
didn't close.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.965
Yeah! That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.051
Susie, when you lie down,

08:30.134 --> 08:31.886
don't your eyes
usually close?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.513
Yes!

08:33.596 --> 08:34.514
That's it!

08:34.597 --> 08:36.890
Susie, your eyes
are stuck open.

08:36.974 --> 08:40.895
And if your eyes don't close
when you lie down,
how can you sleep?

08:40.977 --> 08:43.981
Hmm. I guess I can't.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.233
Exactly.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.402
Okay, everyone,
I have a diagnosis.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.614
Susie, you have
a case of eyeswide-itis.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.324
No wonder
you can't sleep.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.993
And no wonder
she's so cranky.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.872
I am not cranky!
[Doc] You know what?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.416
Last night I didn't sleep
very well, either,

09:02.500 --> 09:05.795
and this morning,
I was so tired and spacey,

09:05.878 --> 09:08.464
I even poured
orange juice in my cereal.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.967
[giggles] Really?

09:11.425 --> 09:13.844
Really. When you don't
get enough sleep,

09:13.928 --> 09:16.639
you can get spacey,
or cranky.

09:17.014 --> 09:21.060
Well, I guess
I was a little cranky.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.604
Or maybe a lot cranky.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.649
But Doc,
can you cure it,

09:26.732 --> 09:29.527
or am I gonna be
cranky forever?

09:29.610 --> 09:32.363
I don't want to be
cranky forever.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.948
You won't be, Susie.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.743
Hmm. It's sticky
around your eyes.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.786
[sniffs]

09:38.869 --> 09:40.454
And it smells like...

Pineapple,
with a tropical fruit
finish.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.795
Hey. Emmie and I

09:47.878 --> 09:50.381
had pineapple ice pops
at our sleepover.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.676
Right before we played
with Susie and Lambie.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.137
I know just what to do.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.680
Wet wipes, please.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.860
Doc, you did it!
You unstuck my eyes!

10:12.069 --> 10:15.239
Oh, I'm so tired.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.909

Now I can get back
to my rocket!

16:54.096 --> 16:57.850
Hold on, Zero.
I still need
to give you a check-up!

That way, we can make sure

you're strong
and healthy enough

Ka-zow! They don't
have such things
on my planet.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.153
What is it, Doc?
It's my stethoscope.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.613
I use this to listen
to your heartbeat.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.826
But I can't find it.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.328

I'm an alien!

19:37.509 --> 19:39.386
Zero, I'm so sorry,

but if you keep
going up in your rocket,

19:42.764 --> 19:45.976

will just keep getting worse.

I'm an alien astronaut.

I was born to soar in my rocket!
I don't know what I'll do
if I can't fly anymore.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.031
You need a cuddle!

20:02.910 --> 20:04.828
Asking me not to fly

20:04.912 --> 20:09.124
is like asking
this strangely soft lamb
to stop cuddling.

Or a dragon
to stop roaring.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.255
That would be so sad!

21:14.022 --> 21:17.067
A seatbelt sounds like
just the thing I need!

21:17.776 --> 21:19.695
There's only one problem.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.114
There's no seatbelt in here!

21:22.447 --> 21:24.866
I think I have something
in my doctor's bag

21:24.950 --> 21:27.786
That I can use to make
a seatbelt for Zero.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.125
I'll just
stick this inside.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.716
These two sides
will stick together
and hold you in!

21:40.799 --> 21:42.342
Now climb in, Zero...

21:42.426 --> 21:43.927
Ka-zow!

21:46.888 --> 21:48.223
Instant seatbelt.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.516
That should hold you!

21:49.599 --> 21:51.518
Launch me again,
launch me again!

21:51.893 --> 21:53.020
You got it!

21:58.358 --> 22:02.696
[all] Three, two, one...
blast off!

22:03.530 --> 22:04.448

22:13.874 --> 22:15.459
[cheering]

22:15.542 --> 22:17.836
You did it, Doc!
You cured me!

22:17.919 --> 22:20.380
Looks like the best way
to ride safely

22:20.464 --> 22:22.966
is to always
wear your seatbelt!

22:23.342 --> 22:26.386
Sure is, and now that
you have your seatbelt...

22:26.470 --> 22:29.723
You shouldn't get
fall-apart-a-tude
ever again.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.726
Well, sugar, looks like
you're all better!

22:55.791 --> 22:58.043
Thanks for fixing me.
You're welcome.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.172
Bye!
Fly by anytime!

23:02.255 --> 23:04.299
Safe travels!

23:05.884 --> 23:07.260
Hi, Carlos!

23:07.719 --> 23:09.346
Doc! Did you fix him?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.890
You bet!
I put in a seatbelt,

23:11.973 --> 23:14.476
he'll be safe
and won't fall apart again.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.186
And it's a good thing, too!

23:16.269 --> 23:17.187
Why's that?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.232
Because it's just
about launch time!

23:20.315 --> 23:21.942
[both laugh]

23:23.318 --> 23:27.072
[both] Three, two, one...
blast off!

23:27.948 --> 23:29.950

23:32.786 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

<span style="style.default_1">Or should you drink</span>
<span style="style.default_1">plenty of water?</span>

23:51.972 --> 23:53.014
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>
