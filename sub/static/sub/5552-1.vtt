00:02.170 --> 00:03.254
<i>Last season on</i> Gotham...

00:03.421 --> 00:05.131
It's in here. It's in this room.

00:05.382 --> 00:07.050
My father's secret, it's in this room.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.095
Going after Loeb is suicide.
Plain and simple.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.305
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

00:12.514 --> 00:13.723
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.934
What's black and white, and red all over?
Stop talking like that.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.437
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

00:22.232 --> 00:24.442
Barbara, Jason Lennon killed your parents.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.444
- You didn't kill them.
- Yes, I did.

00:28.530 --> 00:29.781
Goodbye, Fish!

00:34.452 --> 00:36.830
I'm the King of Gotham!

00:37.163 --> 00:38.331
What is it, do you think?

00:58.476 --> 00:59.728
Bloody hell.

01:04.858 --> 01:06.359
No, wait, wait, wait!

01:25.044 --> 01:27.672
There must be a million possible
combinations, Master Bruce.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.642
Drink it all.

03:02.851 --> 03:04.519
Thank you, master.

03:14.654 --> 03:15.947
Now go.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.328
Come on through. Let's go! Let's go.

03:29.586 --> 03:32.297
I am Zaardon,

03:33.339 --> 03:35.800
the Soul Reaper!

03:36.467 --> 03:40.054
Foolish slaves! You cannot escape me!

03:40.263 --> 03:41.598
Sir, drop the guns!

03:48.396 --> 03:49.564
You! You!

03:52.942 --> 03:56.321
Your primitive weapons cannot hurt me.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.657
Prepare to die, insect.

04:01.659 --> 04:05.079
Hey, listen.
I don't want to shoot you, man, all right?

04:05.330 --> 04:08.291
Too much paperwork.
So why don't you just put the sword down?

04:22.013 --> 04:23.806
Stay down. Relax.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.022
- Yo, Gordon, what's up? Busy shift?
- You're late.

04:31.189 --> 04:34.067
Jeez, relax will you?
What's the matter with you, man?

04:38.905 --> 04:41.991
Hey! Bad idea.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.706
How can this be?

04:48.998 --> 04:51.459
Zaardon drank dragon's blood
from the master's chalice.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.421
- "Zaardon," that spelled how it sounds?
- Two A's.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.048
Close enough.

04:57.298 --> 05:01.511
- You dare send me to prison?
- Oh, no, you're a cinch for Arkham.

05:02.971 --> 05:04.430
Hear me, Gordon.

05:04.889 --> 05:08.101
You might have won this battle,
but the war has just begun.

05:08.643 --> 05:11.437
The master will unleash
hell upon you.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.401
Dark days are coming.

05:17.235 --> 05:18.861
Thanks for the heads-up.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.330
Ed.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.001
- You okay?
- Never better.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.920
<i>Officer Gordon 2-3-6-1-1.</i>

05:36.129 --> 05:38.589
<i>Report to
the captain's office immediately.</i>

05:40.508 --> 05:43.136
I'm up. See you.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.518
He's gone. Relax.

05:51.853 --> 05:56.107
Holy moley, look at you.
Everyone's gonna think you're going nuts.

05:56.774 --> 05:59.610
I get nervous when you talk to me
with other people around like that.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.238
Stop doing that!

06:02.488 --> 06:03.948
- What?
- That!

06:04.657 --> 06:05.783
Copying me.

06:05.992 --> 06:08.161
Dude. It's a mirror.
That's how they work.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.123
<i>You know what I think we need?</i>

06:12.540 --> 06:17.795
I think that we need
a little more fun.

06:18.171 --> 06:19.630
Some romance.

06:20.298 --> 06:22.800
Stop. I know where this is going.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.804
I told you, leave Ms. Kringle alone.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.473
Imagine her in our arms.

06:29.098 --> 06:35.396
Those big eyes looking up at us,
and soft, trembling flesh...

06:35.646 --> 06:36.981
Be quiet!

06:44.989 --> 06:46.365
It's a simple question, Officer Gordon.

06:46.616 --> 06:50.411
Did you or did you not
put your hands on Officer Franks, here?

06:50.620 --> 06:53.206
Yes. I did.

06:56.834 --> 07:00.671
From the first day on the job,
you've been an insubordinate troublemaker.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.342
I hoped demotion to uniform duty
would suffice to make you quit.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.844
It worked for your partner, Bullock.

07:07.345 --> 07:10.223
However, you've now
confessed to violation of section 12.

07:10.515 --> 07:12.391
Immediate dismissal is mandatory.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.897
Commissioner, this is not just.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.608
Officer Franks sustained no harm,

07:20.817 --> 07:23.027
and Officer Gordon
showed admirable restraint

07:23.236 --> 07:25.530
in defusing a dangerous hostage situation.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.658
Thank you so much for your input, Captain.
The facts speak for themselves.

07:28.866 --> 07:32.870
The facts say he deserves
commendation, not dismissal.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.705
You're letting gutter politics--

07:34.956 --> 07:38.084
That's enough, young lady.
Take Officer...

07:39.544 --> 07:42.463
Mr. Gordon's badge and gun.
That's an order.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.431
All good. Let it go.

07:54.725 --> 07:55.852
Thanks, though.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.023
It's been an honor working for you.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.569
This is all for the best, you know.

08:05.653 --> 08:09.282
Some men are just not meant to be cops.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.044
I told you I'd break you.

08:24.630 --> 08:25.840
I will.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.914
What did you say to Loeb?
Did you get mad?

08:58.873 --> 09:01.292
Well, I disagreed with his decision.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.129
Come on, you know I need the details.

09:05.671 --> 09:09.008
I said I'd break him.
Words to that effect.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.427
Hey. You went out with a bang.

09:13.763 --> 09:15.640
Maybe it's for the best.

09:18.142 --> 09:19.977
That's what Loeb said.

09:21.145 --> 09:24.607
Should've walked away.
I just hate to quit.

09:27.235 --> 09:30.196
You didn't quit, you were fired.
What can you do?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.824
There's things I can do.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.119
I thought you said
you didn't have any legal moves left.

09:37.328 --> 09:38.496
I don't.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.128
You wanna be a cop so bad,
you're willing to break the law?

09:46.337 --> 09:48.756
Willing to bend it a little, yeah.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.718
You're happy I got fired, huh?

09:54.053 --> 09:55.263
You got me.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.393
But only because
I know that you'll never quit.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.812
And I love that about you.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.357
But they have you directing traffic, Jim.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.609
Why keep beating your head
against the wall?

10:08.859 --> 10:10.653
I'm a cop, Lee.

10:12.697 --> 10:14.282
I'm a cop.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.960
Hi, gorgeous. I'm Jerome.

10:26.252 --> 10:27.545
Keep moving, ginger.

10:28.045 --> 10:31.257
Just being polite.
So what you in for?

10:31.507 --> 10:32.925
Killing my parents.

10:33.551 --> 10:34.552
Oh.

10:35.219 --> 10:38.264
Me, too! Well, mom, anyhow.

10:39.098 --> 10:43.311
Liberating, right? Oh, what a rush!

10:44.395 --> 10:45.771
All righty then.

10:46.063 --> 10:50.318
You see the big handsome fella
staring at you like you're fried chicken?

10:50.735 --> 10:54.572
Richard Sionis. He's a millionaire.
Got his own airplane.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.325
Got a boat with a hot tub on it.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.786
And he killed 25 people,
just for fun.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.580
So what?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.749
So, he likes you.

11:05.416 --> 11:09.003
- He wants to be your friend.
- Hmm. Let me think. No.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.965
A girl needs a good friend in here.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.302
See, the guards, they don't care.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.763
They figure bad things
happen to bad people.

11:19.013 --> 11:23.434
And they happen all the time.
All the time.

11:25.186 --> 11:27.772
Hey, you. Hello!

11:28.773 --> 11:30.816
Baldy! Here, here. Hello, yes.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.943
Hi. Come here.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.580
Hi.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.749
Hi.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.417
My name is Barbara.

11:50.044 --> 11:52.296
- Would you be my friend?
- Yes.

11:53.297 --> 11:58.677
Hey. If someone here tries to hurt me,
would you protect me?

11:58.928 --> 12:00.012
Yes.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.306
Thank you so much.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.683
Cutie.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.234
- Now I have a friend.
- You're bad.

12:13.609 --> 12:16.028
Yeah, so why don't you
go make me a sandwich?

12:17.488 --> 12:21.283
Your friend is a gorilla.
My friend runs the joint.

12:21.492 --> 12:25.162
And he can get you things
that other people can't get you.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.292
- Things like what?
- Anything you need.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.003
I need a telephone.

12:37.842 --> 12:41.470
Odgen Barker, in for 70 grand
plus two months' vig,

12:41.971 --> 12:43.848
250 and change.

12:44.140 --> 12:47.935
Says he owes Falcone,
Falcone's gone, so his debt's forfeit.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.813
Well, we can't have him saying that.

12:51.021 --> 12:54.567
What if everybody started saying that?
There'd be anarchy.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.862
What is it?

12:58.863 --> 13:01.991
Oh, splendid.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.578
Jim, come on in.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.670
My dear old friend.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.630
We need to talk.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.634
Oh. Leave us.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.226
Hey, Selina.
Moving on up, huh?

13:29.643 --> 13:30.728
Trying.

13:31.270 --> 13:35.483
Isn't she darling?
It's like having a cat around the house.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.319
But no horrid dead mice.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.741
I need a favor.
I figure you owe me one.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.202
I do?

13:47.453 --> 13:50.414
I'm always happy to help you, Jim,
but I don't recall--

13:50.623 --> 13:53.250
The hospital.
I saved you from Maroni's men.

13:53.459 --> 13:55.794
But I was only there
because you arrested me.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.671
For attempted murder.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.925
Remind me again why I let you go.

14:01.342 --> 14:03.093
Enlightened friendship.

14:03.761 --> 14:07.640
I'd call us even, but let's not quibble.

14:08.766 --> 14:11.352
I'm so happy you came to me for help, Jim.

14:12.353 --> 14:15.314
The answer is yes.
Your wish is granted.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.149
You don't know what it is yet.

14:18.776 --> 14:21.946
You want Loeb fired
and your old job back. No?

14:24.114 --> 14:25.115
Yes.

14:25.783 --> 14:29.119
For a good friend like you,
it can be done.

14:29.954 --> 14:31.997
If you're sure that's what you want.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.958
I'm sure.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.793
May I ask why?

14:36.418 --> 14:39.380
Police work in Gotham
is such a thankless job.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.048
Good pension.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.092
What does Lee think?

14:44.218 --> 14:45.261
Who?

14:47.638 --> 14:52.560
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- Relax. I already said I would help.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.479
He is so brusque, isn't he?

14:56.814 --> 15:00.484
Thank you. Oh, while I think on it,

15:01.193 --> 15:04.530
perhaps there's a small favor
you could do for me in return.

15:04.989 --> 15:07.199
I know how you hate to owe favors.

15:09.910 --> 15:15.666
I am having a small business dispute
with a friend of mine, Odgen Barker.

15:16.041 --> 15:20.504
You have a persuasive personality.
Perhaps you can talk to him.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.596
You want me to collect a debt for you?

15:28.846 --> 15:32.641
I want you to prove to me
that our friendship is a real one.

15:33.017 --> 15:35.102
Based on trust and equity.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.521
That's fair.

15:40.691 --> 15:44.903
No, sorry. Can't help you.
Congratulations on all your success.

15:45.571 --> 15:46.864
Be good, Selina.

15:47.239 --> 15:48.324
Always.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.202
Don't say no now, Jim. Sleep on it.

16:01.420 --> 16:05.382
Screw Penguin,
screw the G.C.P.D., and screw this city.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.177
Amen.
You're doing the right thing, brother.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.262
Walk away, Jim, just walk away.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.264
You would do the same thing, right?

16:12.556 --> 16:15.726
Me? I'd serve a sandwich to Beelzebub,
but that's just me.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.604
You are a moralist.
You could never work for Penguin.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.856
The shame would eat away at your guts.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.274
Yeah.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.193
Yeah.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.571
- Whoa. Slow down, slurpy.
- Mmm.

16:28.364 --> 16:32.159
- You're not joining me?
- I've been sober 32 days.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.911
Thirty-two days, huh?

16:34.244 --> 16:37.498
It's no biggy. Once I quit the job,
quitting drinking was easy.

16:38.582 --> 16:41.585
It's the job, Jim.
Makes us angry. Makes us hard.

16:41.877 --> 16:42.961
Yeah, it does.

16:43.212 --> 16:45.214
<i>It's hard to walk away,
but it can be done.</i>

16:45.422 --> 16:47.299
I just couldn't carry that badge anymore.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.803
Look at me now. Hmm?
I'm sober.

16:51.178 --> 16:56.392
I have a woman who does not dislike me.
I live in a house. I sleep at night.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.560
I've never been happier in my life.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.230
Here's to civilian life.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.743
I'm proud of you, bro.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.205
Gotta go.

17:27.965 --> 17:32.219
I really am most frightfully sorry it took
so long to answer the door, sir. Strange.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.389
Normally, a buzzer sounds
when a car comes through the gates.

17:35.723 --> 17:36.932
<i>I walked.</i>

17:37.266 --> 17:39.184
You two are dirty.
What have you been doing?

17:39.476 --> 17:41.562
I imagine you have
something important to say.

17:41.812 --> 17:42.980
Yes.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.567
I've been fired from the G.C.P.D.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.738
I won't be able to keep the promise
I made you. I wanted to apologize.

17:51.029 --> 17:55.033
Your apology is accepted, of course.
But you didn't need to walk here.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.327
A phone call would've been fine.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.204
I needed the air.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.291
- No hope for reinstatement then, sir?
- No.

18:03.917 --> 18:08.005
Well, there is a way, but it's too ugly.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.717
I would have to collect
a debt for Penguin.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.802
To prove our friendship.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.053
Ah.

18:16.513 --> 18:20.559
But you can't do that,
because he's a bad man.

18:21.685 --> 18:25.439
- And the task would be demeaning.
- Well, yes.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.736
You were going
to find my parents' killers.

18:31.361 --> 18:35.866
You were going to fight for justice.
You were going to clean up the G.C.P.D.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.535
- Change Gotham.
- I had hoped to do that.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.872
If you remained at the G.C.P.D., you might
still be able to do all those good things.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.750
But first, you must do something ugly.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.544
And your personal honor forbids that.

18:47.878 --> 18:48.879
Yes.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.300
Are you not sacrificing the greater good

18:53.509 --> 18:56.053
for the sake of your dignity
and self-esteem?

18:57.638 --> 19:00.516
- For vanity?
- Steady on, now, Master Bruce.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.643
- Manners.
- He walked all the way here

19:02.893 --> 19:05.562
to discuss the issue, Alfred.
I'm simply asking a question.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.106
Surely, sometimes the right way

19:09.191 --> 19:10.400
is also the ugly way.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.362
Sometimes a man can't take the right way.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.199
He is dealing with all kinds of business
you can't possibly understand yet

19:17.407 --> 19:18.617
because you're still a child.

19:19.368 --> 19:22.579
Yes, Alfred, there is still
a great deal I don't understand yet.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.333
Please forgive me
if I've offended you, Jim.

19:28.752 --> 19:29.920
No, no.

19:30.796 --> 19:32.256
That's okay.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.758
I'll show you out, sir.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.261
Screw it.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.113
Jerome says you can get me a telephone.

20:38.322 --> 20:39.990
I try and help my friends.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.117
What do your friends do for you?

20:43.660 --> 20:48.999
Well, that depends on how much you want

20:49.666 --> 20:51.168
a telephone.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.856
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it right there.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.650
Odgen Barker.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.361
Penguin asked me to talk to you.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.615
Damn, boy!
You had me worried there for a minute.

21:21.990 --> 21:27.120
I know you. You're Jim Gordon. Cop.
Supposed to be a cold stone hard-ass.

21:27.579 --> 21:31.708
But you're Penguin's bitch, huh?
Who the dickens can you trust anymore?

21:31.959 --> 21:33.293
He wants his money.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.879
How many times
do I got to tell you people? No.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.675
To Don Falcone, I'll pay.
To that fruitcake leprechaun?

21:40.008 --> 21:41.843
Nish. Not a penny.

21:42.052 --> 21:46.223
Falcone's retired. Times change.
Penguin's boss now.

21:46.682 --> 21:50.686
- Like hell. The freak won't last the year.
- Don't underestimate him.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.187
Advice, now.

21:52.396 --> 21:54.106
I'm trying to be nice here.
Let's work this out.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.400
Yeah? Let's not.

21:57.567 --> 21:58.694
Walk away.

22:01.613 --> 22:02.698
Walk away.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.367
Before I kick your ass,
you crooked punk bitch.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.579
How much money you got there?
Looks like a lot.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.123
- What is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

22:11.415 --> 22:12.582
Give me the money you owe.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.918
How about I put a hole in your face?

22:17.587 --> 22:20.674
- I'm gonna count to three.
- You're crazy.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.217
One...

22:28.682 --> 22:31.601
Put the money in the bag.
Do it!

22:40.360 --> 22:42.821
Oh, get him, man.

22:54.750 --> 22:55.876
Stop! Thief!

23:03.467 --> 23:04.593
Out of the way!

23:22.486 --> 23:23.528
Hey, cop.

23:49.179 --> 23:51.807
Fertilizer?
What is your game?

23:52.974 --> 23:56.144
I would have thought that's obvious
to a man of your perception.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.818
It occurred to me
to follow my own advice.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.153
Sometimes the ugly way
is also the right way.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.822
I mean, a bomb, inside the house?

24:07.030 --> 24:08.532
I mean, you're a having a laugh, ain't ya?
A bomb?

24:08.740 --> 24:11.576
I was going to tell you.
I wanted to present it as a fait accompli.

24:11.868 --> 24:14.246
Don't start talking French to me.

24:14.538 --> 24:17.082
You don't know the first thing
about bomb-making anyway, do you?

24:17.374 --> 24:19.126
I read a book, Alfred.
It seems simple enough.

24:19.376 --> 24:20.544
A book.

24:20.794 --> 24:24.631
I mean, you're gonna blow your bloody head
off before you put a dent in that thing.

24:25.423 --> 24:28.218
You know, maybe that door is trying
to tell us something.

24:28.844 --> 24:31.763
Maybe you're not ready
to find out what's behind it.

24:32.139 --> 24:34.141
Maybe we should wait until you're older.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.853
I mean, who knows what your dear old Dad
was up to down there, anyway?

24:43.733 --> 24:45.068
Like what?

24:45.402 --> 24:50.073
Like things I wouldn't want to describe
to a child, which is exactly what you are.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.662
I'm building a bomb
to blow down that door.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.540
You may assist me...

24:59.207 --> 25:02.836
Or not, as you wish.
But if not, some tea would be nice.

25:04.045 --> 25:08.049
Right, well, you're gonna need 10 more
sacks of that gear for starters,

25:08.258 --> 25:12.512
three more jerricans, two lengths
of timber, and a heavy tarpaulin.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.349
And I'll put the kettle on.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.864
Excellent. Excellent.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.366
I'm so sorry things got messy.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.827
What a foolish fellow.

25:36.870 --> 25:40.790
Never mind. I will make sure that there's
no follow-up from your colleagues.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.334
Don't worry about a thing.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.754
You knew. You knew Odgen would go off.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.798
What a devious mind you have.
I had no idea.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.175
We have a deal.

25:51.051 --> 25:53.386
We do. We do.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.150
You okay, Jim?

26:08.526 --> 26:11.029
Oh, yeah. Daydreaming.

26:12.197 --> 26:14.991
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

26:20.872 --> 26:22.457
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

26:22.999 --> 26:24.042
<i>Jim?</i>

26:27.003 --> 26:29.547
<i>- Hello, are you still there?</i>
- I'm here.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.342
<i>Hi! How are you?</i>

26:32.676 --> 26:34.052
How did you get to a phone?

26:34.386 --> 26:38.473
Who cares? We're talking at last.
That's the important thing.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.058
What do you want?

26:40.308 --> 26:42.894
Jim, there's been a terrible mistake.

26:44.020 --> 26:47.065
I never told Lee...

26:47.774 --> 26:49.401
That I killed my Mom and Dad.

26:50.193 --> 26:52.028
<i>And I never attacked her.</i>

26:52.362 --> 26:54.197
She attacked me, Jim!

26:54.823 --> 26:56.199
She's completely insane!

26:56.449 --> 26:58.868
That's enough. Don't call again.

26:59.494 --> 27:00.620
Who was that?

27:03.957 --> 27:06.668
Sales call.
They can drive you crazy, huh?

27:06.835 --> 27:07.877
Sales call?

27:14.676 --> 27:15.719
Don't!

27:16.011 --> 27:17.846
- What?
- Don't answer it.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.681
- Jim, you're scaring me.
- It's Barbara.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.141
<i>Go ahead and leave a message.</i>

27:22.475 --> 27:28.106
<i>Hey, girlfriend. Guess who?
Sorry I missed you. Bummer, hey?</i>

27:29.399 --> 27:30.734
I just wanted to say...

27:30.984 --> 27:33.445
That I hope you die screaming, bitch.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.072
<i>Bye!</i>

27:38.742 --> 27:41.453
- Nice.
- All right, look.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.080
She's safely locked up at Arkham.
She can't hurt you.

27:44.289 --> 27:47.500
I know. I know. She's just a sick person,
spreading sadness.

27:50.045 --> 27:53.715
Screw her. Let's be happy.
Let's go away some place.

27:54.049 --> 27:56.092
We can't let a crazy woman drive us out.

27:56.343 --> 27:59.596
Why not? Pride? Who cares?

27:59.929 --> 28:03.433
We could go away and never come back.
What's keeping us here?

28:05.977 --> 28:08.813
- I can't leave.
- Why not?

28:10.023 --> 28:12.984
- Jim.
- I did a bad thing.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.783
I did a bad thing.

28:51.523 --> 28:52.607
Hi.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.447
Do you have any peanut butter?

29:00.949 --> 29:02.283
What?

29:07.705 --> 29:10.708
Peanut butter? Smooth, for preference.

29:11.334 --> 29:13.878
Guards! Help! Help!

29:19.509 --> 29:20.802
Oh. Hi, boss.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.347
How about a bottle of beer?

29:40.780 --> 29:45.076
Let me share a dilemma with you.
May I?

29:48.621 --> 29:52.709
I need you to do something for me
that I know you won't want to do.

29:53.251 --> 29:54.335
What is it?

29:54.794 --> 29:56.880
With most people, there's no problem.

29:57.922 --> 30:02.844
I find their weak spots and use violence
or blackmail to persuade them.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.138
But you...

30:06.848 --> 30:09.476
You are a man of monkish virtue.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.145
You have no vices to expose.

30:12.604 --> 30:16.065
So, threats of personal violence
will only harden your resolve, huh?

30:16.649 --> 30:20.570
- No, that--
- Come, sir, don't be modest.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.491
You are a rare animal.

30:26.075 --> 30:29.037
But that does lead us to this sad pickle.

30:30.163 --> 30:32.999
Since I can't persuade you to do as I ask,

30:33.374 --> 30:36.419
the only rational option is to kill you,

30:37.212 --> 30:40.590
and negotiate with whomever
replaces you as Commissioner.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.091
Now, chief?

30:43.051 --> 30:44.594
One moment, Victor.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.555
The Commissioner deserves time
to process all this.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.600
Say a prayer or what have you.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.310
What do you want me to do?

30:53.228 --> 30:55.271
It's not worth talking about.

30:55.772 --> 30:58.024
- You wouldn't do it.
- Tell me.

31:01.361 --> 31:04.614
I need my friend Jim Gordon
reinstated as a detective.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.743
See? You hate that idea.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.954
No, I'll... I'll do it.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.831
Mmm-mmm.
I can tell that you're not sincere.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.626
Even if you do as I ask,

31:16.918 --> 31:21.464
someday down the line, you'll change
your mind and you'll turn on him again.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.301
You want me to kill him now?

31:25.468 --> 31:28.638
No, make him a nice cheese toastie.
Yes, kill him now, please.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.014
Just wanted to be clear.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.642
No, wait! Let's talk about this!

31:32.809 --> 31:35.019
Sorry. Least worst option.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.690
Unless, of course--

31:39.440 --> 31:41.276
No. You would never agree.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.194
To what? Agree to what?

32:08.595 --> 32:10.346
Lovely, lovely. Bravo.

32:11.347 --> 32:14.017
Mayor James regrets
he's unable to attend today,

32:14.434 --> 32:16.728
but he's sent a dear friend in his stead.

32:17.145 --> 32:18.354
Please welcome,

32:18.605 --> 32:21.691
distinguished businessman,
visionary scientist,

32:21.983 --> 32:25.778
acclaimed philanthropist,
and new Chairman of Development

32:26.195 --> 32:28.281
at the Gotham Chamber of Commerce,

32:28.781 --> 32:30.450
Mr. Theo Galavan.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.541
Thank you so much. Uh...

32:39.042 --> 32:44.130
What an honor it is to be here today,
to help bid farewell to a great man,

32:44.589 --> 32:46.924
and a faithful servant of this city.

32:47.342 --> 32:51.262
What can I say about Gillian Loeb?

32:53.556 --> 32:56.643
Someone tell me a funny story.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.770
I have a good one.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.022
So, when I was in college,

33:01.397 --> 33:05.401
I played for the varsity polo team.
And I had a string of ponies...

33:05.818 --> 33:07.195
Greetings!

33:07.820 --> 33:11.240
I am Zaardon the Soul Reaper.

33:12.742 --> 33:14.369
So, I had these ponies...

33:14.702 --> 33:17.121
I'm an adopted son of this city.

33:17.413 --> 33:21.918
I haven't lived in Gotham very long,
but I already love her like a native.

33:23.294 --> 33:28.049
It just kind of grabs hold of you,
doesn't it?

33:30.968 --> 33:34.097
There's magic here. Magic.

33:35.264 --> 33:39.060
And that is down
to everyday heroes like Gillian Loeb.

33:40.061 --> 33:43.439
Mister Commissioner,
thank you for your service.

33:54.951 --> 33:57.286
Thank you very much, everybody.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.207
My best wishes to...

34:06.003 --> 34:07.505
Commissioner Essen.

34:15.555 --> 34:18.808
And the maître d' says,
"You can't bring them in here..."

34:19.016 --> 34:20.226
Hear me, slaves.

34:20.643 --> 34:24.564
My patience is wearing thin.
Surrender your souls to my mercy,

34:24.856 --> 34:27.233
or I swear by the Master,

34:27.859 --> 34:32.488
I shall feast on your pain!
I shall gorge on your torment!

34:33.156 --> 34:35.533
I shall crush you like a bug.

35:03.686 --> 35:06.022
Backup Area Five. Area Five!

35:20.912 --> 35:22.538
Welcome back, Jim.

35:22.830 --> 35:26.959
I don't know how you pulled this off,
but I'm glad you did.

35:27.627 --> 35:29.337
He's a resourceful man.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.590
- Congratulations, to both of you.
- Thank you.

35:32.924 --> 35:36.385
And it is a new day, Jim.
We're going to do great things.

35:36.636 --> 35:37.887
Yes, we are.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.230
It is a new day.

35:48.481 --> 35:50.149
Things are gonna be all right. I promise.

35:51.234 --> 35:53.861
- I hope it was worth it.
- I hope so, too.

35:54.821 --> 35:55.905
Jim.

35:57.406 --> 35:58.574
What's wrong?

35:58.866 --> 36:03.037
There's been an incident at Arkham Asylum.
Six inmates have escaped.

36:03.329 --> 36:06.249
- Barbara Kean was one of them.
- Oh, my God.

36:17.051 --> 36:20.221
- What the hell is this place?
- It ain't Arkham, anyhow.

36:21.305 --> 36:22.765
Things are looking up.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.434
Welcome, everyone.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.857
My name is Theo Galavan.
This is my sister, Tabitha.

36:34.777 --> 36:37.947
I understand you're feeling confused...

36:39.198 --> 36:42.702
Scared, a little groggy,
but please, relax.

36:42.952 --> 36:46.956
Today is the first day
of a wonderful future for all of you.

36:47.874 --> 36:50.001
- If you want it.
- Who are you?

36:51.002 --> 36:53.838
Well, now, the question is, who are you?

36:55.381 --> 36:58.467
The world sees criminal lunatics.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.137
I see brilliance.

37:02.847 --> 37:04.473
I see charisma.

37:07.435 --> 37:08.728
And power.

37:10.813 --> 37:12.231
I see power.

37:13.482 --> 37:16.652
Yes! Exactly, my man.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.905
That is so spooky. That is me to a T.

37:19.280 --> 37:23.034
These other bozos, I don't know,
but you're singing my song.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.869
Quiet, Jerome.

37:25.745 --> 37:26.871
Keep talking.

37:30.166 --> 37:34.837
Imagine a group
of brilliant outlaws like yourselves,

37:35.212 --> 37:37.924
each selected for a unique ability,

37:38.174 --> 37:41.844
all working together as a team.
Imagine the synergy.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.513
Imagine the impact.

37:45.139 --> 37:47.391
Gotham would tremble before you.

37:48.601 --> 37:53.564
Well, that sounds fabulous,
but I'm not a brilliant outlaw.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.608
I just have...

37:56.734 --> 37:59.028
Hmm... Issues.

37:59.820 --> 38:05.159
You have ferocity and beauty and desire.
And that's enough.

38:06.661 --> 38:08.412
Come with me, Barbara.

38:09.872 --> 38:12.917
Whatever you want in the world,
it's yours.

38:14.418 --> 38:17.922
Theo? That's your name, right? Theo.

38:18.339 --> 38:20.591
You're getting way
ahead of yourself, here.

38:20.841 --> 38:26.472
First of all, keep your hands off her.
Second, this whole "magic team"?

38:27.181 --> 38:29.976
I gotta pass. I don't take orders.

38:30.726 --> 38:34.063
Good luck on everything, though.
It's an intriguing concept.

38:36.983 --> 38:38.734
This is very disappointing.

38:39.235 --> 38:40.236
Oh.

38:41.153 --> 38:47.076
Fair play. You want a reward for
busting us out of Arkham. I'm grateful.

38:48.411 --> 38:50.997
How's a million bucks sound? Pretty good?

38:51.247 --> 38:52.832
I can get it for you today...

38:53.749 --> 38:55.876
As soon as I hit the street.

38:56.252 --> 39:00.840
Money's not the concern.
I had such high hopes for you.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.970
I didn't anticipate sexual jealousy.
That always poisons the well.

39:06.721 --> 39:09.682
You have to go.
Tabitha will see you out.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.397
Miss Kean is coming with me.

39:16.939 --> 39:19.316
Oh, She doesn't want
to go where you're going.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.958
Anyone else wanna leave?

40:04.904 --> 40:09.533
There. You're absolutely sure about this,
Master Bruce? I strongly advise--

40:09.742 --> 40:12.161
Alfred, I need to know.

40:14.538 --> 40:16.082
Let's do this.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.001
Right, sir.

40:32.723 --> 40:34.266
Yes!

40:34.475 --> 40:35.768
Great! Yes!

41:32.074 --> 41:33.242
"Dear Bruce...

41:34.326 --> 41:36.787
"These last weeks I begin
to feel very mortal,

41:38.372 --> 41:42.001
"which prompts this note to you.
Perhaps I'm being paranoid.

41:42.459 --> 41:46.463
"I hope so. In any case,
if you're reading this, then I'm dead,

41:47.256 --> 41:50.092
"and you figured out
that the entry code is... Bruce.

41:52.595 --> 41:55.514
"I'm sorry I had to hide this part
of my life from you.

41:55.764 --> 41:58.100
"Because this place only exists
because of you.

41:58.350 --> 42:01.103
"Becoming a father made me want
to be a better man,

42:01.353 --> 42:04.315
"and I started asking hard questions
about the family business.

42:04.565 --> 42:05.858
"So here we are.

42:06.442 --> 42:10.362
"As I write this, you're 12,
and a fine, good-hearted boy,

42:11.906 --> 42:14.658
"so I'm sure you'll be a fine,
good-hearted man.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.119
"But that's all I know.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.414
"I don't know what happened
to me or your mother,

42:21.457 --> 42:23.250
"or how life has turned out for you.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.961
"I don't even know how old you are.

42:27.379 --> 42:30.674
"So I'll resist giving
you much fatherly advice.

42:31.800 --> 42:37.223
"Only this. You can't have both
happiness and the truth.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.101
<i>"You have to choose.</i>

42:49.860 --> 42:52.947
"I beg of you my son,
please, choose happiness.

42:53.239 --> 42:56.659
"Unless you feel a calling.

43:02.665 --> 43:04.333
"A true calling."
