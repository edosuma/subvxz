WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:47.505 --> 00:49.006
Looks good, right?

00:54.095 --> 00:59.099
So, my plan is to create
this cluster of live/work lofts

00:59.267 --> 01:02.061
all along the perimeter here.
And. . . Come here.

01:02.145 --> 01:06.023
l also am planning this neighborhood-y
kind of dining and retail area

01:06.107 --> 01:07.316
in the central square.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.860
You know, l even had this thought
that maybe you, Denise and Hailey

01:09.944 --> 01:12.488
could open up a second location
for your store.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.323
Really? Because Denise keeps talking

01:14.407 --> 01:16.075
about wanting to open up
another branch.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.576
Well, it'd be great. Yeah.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.579
Look, the land is a little pricey,
so l couldn't develop it right away,

01:20.663 --> 01:22.164
but once l sell the Ferrigno estate,

01:22.248 --> 01:24.541
l figured out l could at least
put a down payment on it

01:24.626 --> 01:28.921
and still have enough money left over
for the reception in Santa Barbara.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.840
What are you talking about?
What reception?

01:33.843 --> 01:36.762
Zooey, l know it's only been
eight months,

01:36.846 --> 01:40.849
but l am so madly, insanely,
ridiculously in love with you.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.190
Will you marry me?

01:48.358 --> 01:51.443
Yes! lt just happened
two minutes ago, Hailey.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.404
-Can you believe it?
-No, I can't. It's amazing.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.490
Oh, my God.
I've been on Iike 1 0 miIIion dates,

01:56.574 --> 01:58.325
and you end up marrying
some totaIIy awesome guy

01:58.409 --> 02:00.452
who randomIy waIks into our store?

02:00.537 --> 02:02.621
lt's so cute. She doesn't know
she's on speakerphone.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.873
You do not know how Iucky you are.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.126
lt is impossible
to find a good guy in this city.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.669
-I know.
-l thought we were connecting.

02:09.753 --> 02:12.172
-Oh, my God. Really?
-Kind of.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.758
l'm sorry, but not really.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.220
-Hey, will you conference in Denise?
-Oh, my God! You caIIed me first?

02:18.304 --> 02:20.681
-Oh, God.
-Awesome. Yes. HoId on.

02:21.724 --> 02:25.144
Hi.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.320
-l love that piece of land. lt's perfect.
-l'm glad.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.447
l mean, l know the neighborhood's
a little, you know. . .

02:37.532 --> 02:40.659
Oh, my God, Zo! I cannot
fucking beIieve you didn't caII me first!

02:40.743 --> 02:44.204
You are such a freak.
Hailey's first on my speed dial.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.331
No, no, no, I'm totaIIy kidding.
I'm so psyched for you.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.583
I feeI Iike I'm gonna puke right now.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.709
Oh, my God, hold on.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.586
Barry hates when l'm in the house
during his poker night.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.920
Would you give me a second,
you fat douche?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.505
Get out. Get out of the fucking house. . .

02:53.590 --> 02:55.090
-Zooey just got engaged !
-To who?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.176
-"To who," are you joking? To Peter.
-To who? To me.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.886
-I don't know Peter.
-l've met the guy like 20 times.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.512
-You've met him like 20 times.
-l don't know Peter.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.389
-You don't know Peter?
-l have no idea who that is.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.724
Okay, we've been on like 20 dates
with him.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.309
-You don't know him?
-l've never met Peter.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.019
You are such an asshole.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.187
Sorry, Zo. Have you set a date?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.022
Yes. June 30th in Santa Barbara.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.524
Peter already booked the place
we went for that long weekend.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.650
So romantic.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.485
Oh, my God. He is so romantic.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.738
That's the place where you guys
fucked for the first time, right?

03:22.285 --> 03:23.243
No.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.537
No, no, no,
that was the hot tub in Mexico.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.497
That's right.
Santa Barbara was just oral.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.832
-Yeah.
-You guys.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.125
That's right. The hot tub, yeah.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.920
lt was Mexico. You had your period in
Santa Barbara and you wanted to wait.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.631
God, you're so oId-fashioned, Zooey.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.634
-You told them about the hot tub?
-Maybe.

03:39.677 --> 03:43.555
-Wow. So, June 30th?
-Yeah, l know. lt's soon, but. . .

03:43.640 --> 03:44.806
Who cares? Peter's a doll,

03:44.891 --> 03:46.683
and he goes down on you
like six times a week.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.101
-What are you waiting for?
-Wow.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.311
Marry him. Don't wait.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.896
Lock that tongue down, girl.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.356
Yeah. lt's gonna be great.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.608
All right, you guys, l'll call you later.
Love you.

04:04.786 --> 04:10.082
lt is beautiful. lt's totally understated,
and it's just. . . lt's perfect.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.335
l know! No, he's the best. l feel so lucky.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.964
All right. All right, Debbie.
l'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.425
Honey!
l've been totally hogging the phone.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.219
-Who do you wanna call?
-l'm okay.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.513
My parents are probably asleep,
so l'll just talk to them tomorrow.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.098
You don't wanna tell
any of your friends?

04:26.182 --> 04:28.141
l'll make some calls this weekend.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.810
Really?
Well, what about that guy, Tevin?

04:29.894 --> 04:31.937
You talk to him
like 20 times a day, right?

04:32.021 --> 04:34.106
Well, yeah.
He works two cubicles away from me.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.274
l'll see him Monday morning.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.776
Or what's his name?
The one that you fence with.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.902
-Gil?
-Gil.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.696
Gil. Gilliam.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.907
No, he's not really a "call right away"
kind of friend.

04:47.578 --> 04:48.870
Toasting.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.924
-Hi ! Hi.
-Hi.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.303
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Mom.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.888
-Excellent meat.
-So good.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.474
-This is delicious. Thank you so much.
-Really is, Mom.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.976
Thank you.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.770
But did Peter have any good friends
growing up?

05:14.230 --> 05:16.106
l honestly don't remember any.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.899
All right, look, Zooey,
just to clarify here,

05:17.984 --> 05:20.986
my dad worked for lBM,
so we moved a lot when l was a kid.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.821
Robbie always managed to have friends.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.823
Of course, he probably wanted
to suck their dicks, but. . .

05:24.907 --> 05:26.116
Oswald !

05:26.492 --> 05:28.118
No, Mom, it's cool. l totally did.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.287
But he doesn't have to use
that kind of language.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.413
-lndeed.
-Why?

05:31.497 --> 05:34.499
My son is a gay man,
and l embrace his lifestyle.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.335
lt's true. Dad loves the gays.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.629
l actually made him
an honorary homo last month.

05:40.298 --> 05:44.259
The point is, Zooey, Peter always
connected better with women.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.554
You know, l can see that
because he's a great boyfriend.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.014
Thank you, fiancée.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.349
Also, you gotta understand, Zooey.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.477
Peter matured sexually
at a very early age.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.520
l remember taking him swimming
when he was 1 2 years old.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.647
Kid had a bush
like a 40-year-old Serbian.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.526
Come on. Okay.
Dad, please, stop talking.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.111
-Good to know.
-Nice.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.156
Come on. He had a Speedo full of Brillo.
Be proud.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.908
God.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.786
Who invited the stand-up comedian
over here?

06:11.329 --> 06:14.623
Zooey, here's the deal.
Peter's always been a "girlfriend guy."

06:14.707 --> 06:17.292
He put all his focus and energy
into his relationships,

06:17.377 --> 06:19.711
and all his dude friends
just fell by the wayside.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.631
Zooey, don't listen to him, all right?
l mean, we're eight years apart.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.716
Barely grew up together
in the same house.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.302
This is ridiculous.
Why is it weird that l had girlfriends?

06:27.387 --> 06:30.097
Nothing. We're just saying
you never really had a best friend, is all.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.432
-Well, who's your best friend?
-l have two.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.267
Hank Mardukas has been
my closest friend

06:34.352 --> 06:35.560
since our first year at lBM.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.479
-Best man at our wedding. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, he was.

06:37.563 --> 06:41.358
Talk to him two, three times a week
on the phone for 30 years now.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.151
And then there's Robbie.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.529
What's up?

06:46.489 --> 06:50.492
-Robbie is your other best friend?
-Correct. And Hank Mardukas.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.455
What the shit is he looking at?

07:43.671 --> 07:46.506
Davis Dunn Realty,
how may l direct your call? Please hold.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.886
Hold, please. Put him through to Tevin.

07:51.345 --> 07:55.015
lt's very close to downtown.
How close do you wanna be?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.225
Thank you, sweetheart.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.645
l can't get you that close.
'Cause the schools are terrible.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.817
The skyscrapers were all lit up.
l got down on one knee.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.527
She was totally surprised.

08:07.612 --> 08:11.406
Well, l'm jealous, Peter,
'cause you never gave me a shot.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.575
But you're gonna
make the best husband.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.828
Stop it. Stop.
All right, you can continue now.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.918
Morning, Trayce.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.088
-Hey, Tevin.
-Hey, man.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.173
What's so funny?

08:28.257 --> 08:29.508
One of the guys
in my fantasy football league

08:29.592 --> 08:30.550
just sent me a QuickTime.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.178
lt's a grandma riding a Sybian machine.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.554
What's that?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.139
lt's one of those vibrating saddles

08:36.224 --> 08:39.851
that women sit on to give them,
like, super intense orgasms.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.229
Check it out.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.232
-Damn!
-How sick is that?

08:45.316 --> 08:47.484
lt's very. That's very sick.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.027
So awesome.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.490
Hey. So, what up, dog?
How's that Ferrigno dealio coming?

08:53.574 --> 08:56.535
lt's coming good. Yeah. l'm getting
ready to show in a couple of weeks.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.453
Great.
Dude, l'm just gonna throw this out there

08:58.538 --> 09:00.288
because it's a big piece of house.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.583
lf you want a copilot on this,
l'd be happy to team up with you.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.962
No, l know. l feel like l wanna
give myself the challenge

09:07.046 --> 09:08.505
-and just see how it goes. . .
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.840
-l appreciate the offer.
-No sweat.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.385
Hey, anyway, you know,
my girlfriend and l. . .

09:13.469 --> 09:17.097
Well, we had this very special evening
planned, and l. . .

09:17.181 --> 09:21.226
She's a squirter! She's squirting !
Peter, we got a squirter!

09:23.271 --> 09:24.813
Old Faithful !

09:26.232 --> 09:27.357
Hello, fiancée.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.485
Hey, baby. I totaIIy forgot.
It's my turn to host Iadies' night.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.196
No prob.
l have fencing practice, anyway.

09:33.281 --> 09:37.117
l'll grab a beer with Gil and the boys
afterward. Hit them with the big news.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.412
-Great! I gotta go. Love you.
-l love you, too.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.206
Peter! Peter!

09:44.083 --> 09:45.750
l'm sending it to you.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.128
-No. l don't want it.
-You got it.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.796
God !

09:49.880 --> 09:53.842
Wait a minute, l didn't even click. . .
How does it. . . l didn't even click it on.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.635
She's got a bush like a porcupine.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.513
l don't wanna know anything
about her bush. Hi, Lynette.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.232
-Suck it!
-Good bout, Gil. Sweet bout!

10:10.443 --> 10:11.735
Good job.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.071
Wow. Way to go, buddy.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.700
-Great bout.
-Fuck off!

10:21.078 --> 10:23.872
Bro, really sorry l lost my shit out there.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.790
l just did not see that
ln Quartata coming.

10:25.875 --> 10:26.958
Hey, man, don't worry.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.918
You know, you came in
with a pretty sweet glissade.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.379
Anybody seen my manchette?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.632
Did you look under your plastron,
dick wicker?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.176
-Fuck you, Larry!
-Fuck you, Eugene.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.470
-Classic.
-Thank you, Larry.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.142
Hey, so you guys want to,
like, get some grub

10:44.226 --> 10:45.310
or grab a beer or something?

10:45.394 --> 10:47.979
We're actually heading up
to Joshua Tree tonight.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.689
Oh, yeah? What's going on up there?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.232
We're just doing this thing
for Eugene, you know.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.278
Kind of a bachelor party/camping trip
kind of thing, you know.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.531
l didn't even know
you were getting married.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.409
Yeah. Taking the leap next Sunday.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.703
-Great.
-Dirty little slut.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.164
He's gonna lose his virginity finally.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.333
l've fucked my girlfriend. He's kidding.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.837
Right on ! Very cool.
Very, very cool. That's cool.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.508
l would've invited you, man.
l just didn't think that you'd be into it.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.677
You never really come out with us
after practice and stuff.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.012
Oh, no, dude. . . Don't even.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.599
lt's so fine. Really.
Thanks, though. Thank you, but. . .

11:24.684 --> 11:28.186
You know, it's funny, actually.
l just got engaged myself.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.272
-Wow. That's awesome.
-You did? Congratulations.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.941
-MazeI tov.
-That's great.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.693
Good luck with that.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.612
-Thank you. And you, too.
-Thanks.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.280
Yeah.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.283
All right, well,
we should probably hit the road.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.368
-Traffic.
-Yes.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.703
-Have a blast.
-Shotgun.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.287
-We'll be back on Wednesday, right?
-Yeah.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.623
Play a U2 record while you're there.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.626
-Good. 'Cause of Joshua Tree.
-That's right.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.134
lt's hilarious, know what l mean?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.515
No, l'm serious.
You know what my favorite nights are?

12:05.599 --> 12:08.226
Hanging out with you girls,
and l can do that guilt-free

12:08.310 --> 12:10.103
because Barry loves hanging out
with his friends, too.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.355
l mean, every weekend,
there's a golf getaway,

12:12.440 --> 12:14.232
a ski trip, a weekend in Vegas.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.901
Wait, Vegas? You're not worried
he's gonna cheat on you?

12:16.986 --> 12:20.822
He's 40 pounds overweight
with a Jewfro and a small dick.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.741
Look, l love the guy to death,
but l'm far and away

12:22.825 --> 12:24.242
the best-looking woman
he's ever gonna get,

12:24.326 --> 12:25.827
and l'm only a 7, so, come on.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.162
Oh, my God. You're not a 7.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.717
Peter's not a freakazoid.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.802
l don't know, Zo.
l mean, l think this is kind of serious.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.430
A guy without friends
can be really clingy.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.849
Like, my brother-in-law
drives my sister crazy.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.893
He's always like,
"When are you gonna be home?

12:49.977 --> 12:51.644
"Where're you going?
Can l come with you?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.480
"But nothing's on TV.
What am l gonna do?"

12:53.564 --> 12:55.774
-That's. . . No, come on. What the. . .
-"Be home before midnight."

12:55.858 --> 12:58.401
Peter's not like that. Please.
He's just not like that.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.652
Well, just wait.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.238
But anyway, you've got six bridesmaids
and a maid of honor.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.491
lt's gonna be a little weird
if we're walking down the aisle alone.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.242
-Yeah, l know.
-He's great.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.703
-So who's gonna be his best man?
-l have no idea.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.790
l honestly think that his best friend
is his mom.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.626
-Terrible.
-No, no, no. Not like that.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.922
Peter?

13:21.592 --> 13:22.884
Honey?

13:27.223 --> 13:28.306
Hey!

13:28.891 --> 13:30.350
-Hey!
-Hey!

13:31.227 --> 13:34.062
l made you guys some root beer floats.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.190
Peter, are those chocolate straws?

13:37.274 --> 13:40.318
Yeah. Pirouettes. Pepperidge Farm.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.154
Thank you so much for the floats, baby.
That was so sweet.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.239
My pleasure. Enjoy.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.325
-Hey, congratulations on the wedding.
-Congratulations!

13:48.786 --> 13:51.830
l know. lt's so exciting.
l feel so grown-up.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.249
-All right, sir.
-Okay, ma'am.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.417
Okay.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.045
Shit! Do you think he heard us?

13:59.129 --> 14:01.339
-No.
-No way.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.258
l gotta get some fucking friends.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.721
This is cool.
You're coming to me for help.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.057
Well, the good news is
not only do l know men,

14:11.141 --> 14:13.518
but straight guys are my specialty.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.769
What does that mean?

14:14.854 --> 14:18.022
l get bored pursuing gays.
l like to give myself more of a challenge.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.567
-Yeah !
-Excuse me one second.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.694
There you go, brother.
Dig deep, come on.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.613
Push that shit out. Look at me,
l'm pinkies. l'm barely touching it.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.868
You're clear. Locked it in, dude.
Nice job. Nice lift.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.870
-Thanks, man.
-You're welcome.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.080
All right, l'll see you around.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.665
l hope so.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.883
-That guy was totally flirting with you.
-l told you.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.552
And did you see his wedding ring?
Straight as an arrow.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.637
l'm telling you, hooking up is easy.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.639
Meeting platonic male friends,
not so much.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.725
So, what do l do?
l mean, how do l meet friends?

14:53.809 --> 14:55.351
lt's such a weird concept.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.521
Well, l can do some recon
around the gym,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.440
but you're gonna have to be
aggressive about this, man.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.567
-Yeah, yeah.
-Use the lnternet to meet guys.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.027
Get Mom to fix you up.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.404
l mean, if you see a cool-looking guy,
strike up a conversation

15:06.488 --> 15:08.406
-and ask him on a man-date.
-A what?

15:08.490 --> 15:10.074
-A man-date.
-Okay.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.367
-You know what l mean?
-No.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.746
By that, l mean a casual lunch
or after-work drinks, okay?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.372
No dinner and no movies.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.583
You're not taking these boys
to see The DeviI Wears Prada.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.919
God, l love that movie.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.921
No, l won't. l got you.
l know what you mean.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.423
This is really exciting.
We're gonna find you some friends.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.677
-So l'm gonna. . . What do l do?
-You don't play much?

15:29.762 --> 15:33.222
-l used to play a lot of Hearts in college.
-This is the same thing.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.059
l don't even know why he called.
This guy hasn't even played poker.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.561
l don't know.
l don't know, but it's Zooey's fiancé,

15:38.646 --> 15:40.063
so just shut the fuck up and be nice.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.690
Well, if l do this, we have sex
with the lights on when you get home.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.234
-Really?
-Yeah. Like in Jamaica.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.571
-Fine.
-All night long.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.074
-Fine. Love you.
-All right.

15:51.408 --> 15:55.870
My brother's a great guy, you know?
l mean, he's smart, he's. . .

15:56.664 --> 15:57.872
Well, actually,
l don't know him that well,

15:57.957 --> 16:01.542
but l'll give you five free sessions
if you take him out.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.211
Go Beckham !

16:04.129 --> 16:07.799
So glad Robbie hooked this up.
This is awesome! This is awesome!

16:07.883 --> 16:10.677
-Me, too. This is really. . .
-lsn't this great, man? l love soccer!

16:10.761 --> 16:17.642
Here we go, Galaxy! Here we go!

16:17.726 --> 16:19.602
Come on, Peter, stand up. Here we go. . .

16:19.687 --> 16:20.853
Shut the fuck up!

16:20.938 --> 16:22.230
All right, now people are really upset.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.481
-You shut up!
-No, you shut up!

16:23.565 --> 16:25.400
-You shut up!
-Hey, watch the game!

16:25.567 --> 16:29.320
Honey, he just moved to LA.
He barely knows anyone.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.822
He's an architect.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.616
His mother says
he's so excited to meet you.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.119
Robbie toId me not to have dinner
with any of these guys.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.580
Your brother's a crazy person.
One dinner won't kill you.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.583
-Doug?
-Peter?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.419
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.590
-So you just moved here, huh?
-l did. Pretty recently.

16:49.675 --> 16:53.594
A couple of weeks.
Fresh off the boat from Chicago.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.304
Chi-Town.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.931
-Windy City.
-Oh, yeah.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.143
Da Bears.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.187
Those sports guys.

17:03.272 --> 17:07.692
You know what else, the other old
Saturday Night Live one l love? The. . .

17:07.776 --> 17:10.819
What's the one Dana Carvey does
with the old lady who's like. . .

17:10.904 --> 17:12.195
-Church Lady?
-Yes! Yes!

17:12.281 --> 17:17.201
"lsn't that special?"

17:17.411 --> 17:19.746
That sounded
kind of more leprechaun-y.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.705
-lt did?
-lt did a little. Like a leprechaun.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.253
Nice to meet you, too, Mel Stein.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.299
The picture's from
a coupIe of years back.

17:33.635 --> 17:37.805
Have a seat. l'm so happy
to meet you in person, you know.

17:38.307 --> 17:42.143
Me, too. How long have you been
using the lnternet?

17:43.687 --> 17:45.229
Three or four years.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.857
l didn't know anything about it
until a couple of years ago.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.901
-You're good at it now.
-Thank you.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.904
-And the big dog !
-There it is!

17:52.988 --> 17:54.197
Let me ask you guys.
Let me ask you guys.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.699

17:56.784 --> 17:58.409
-One, two, three. Beatles.
-All in.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.994
-Fuck you.

That's you, pal.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.044
-Anybody else? Just me and you?

18:27.523 --> 18:30.650

18:30.734 --> 18:32.026
Don't take it too seriously.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.071
What are you staying in

18:35.155 --> 18:39.325
With a fucking rainbow rag flop!
Take the fucking chips. l'm buying in.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.827

19:09.898 --> 19:12.733
Come on, Pete! lt's all you, Peter!

-This is not cool ! Get the fuck out!

19:50.063 --> 19:52.523
l gotta tell you, Doug,
l really enjoyed this.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.275
You know, l've been out
with so many jerks recently.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.195
lt's nice to meet somebody
l can have an actual conversation with.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.696
-Let's do it again.
-l'd love to.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.533
Okay. Tomorrow night. Matsuhisa, 8:00.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.286
-l will see you there, sir.
-Awesome.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.473
You've been so busy.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.392
l've hardly seen you
these past couple weeks.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.354
l know. l've been crazy at work.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.606
l'm happy to see you now.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.865
-Have you been kissing someone?
-No.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.287
Peter, your mouth tastes like an ashtray.

20:50.249 --> 20:54.001
Yes. l went to dinner with this guy,
and he kissed me.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.963
What the fuck are you talking about?

20:57.047 --> 20:59.548
My mom set me up with this guy,

20:59.633 --> 21:01.759
and he thought l was gay,
and it was just. . .

21:01.843 --> 21:03.427
lt was a whole misunderstanding.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.304
-Your mom set you up with a guy?
-Yeah.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.098
You told me you were going to dinner
with a client.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.475
-No.
-What the hell is going on?

21:09.559 --> 21:12.103
Look, l overheard you
talking to the other girls

21:12.187 --> 21:14.021
on your girls' night and. . .

21:14.106 --> 21:15.147
l knew it.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.192
Look, l know that you're stressed out
that l don't have any close friends,

21:18.277 --> 21:20.778
so l've been trying to meet someone.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.824
Right, you've been. . .
Okay, so that explains a lot.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.910
l thought it was so weird
that you wanted to hang out with Barry.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.621
-Yeah, exactly. That guy's a dick.
-Yeah.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.957
-l threw up in his face.
-Yeah, l know. Denise told me.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.293
-l threw up in his. . . A lot.
-Yeah.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.503
-Projectiled.
-Yeah.

21:37.587 --> 21:40.006
-That's a real thing.
-Yeah.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.133
Well, l don't think l'm gonna
meet anybody by June 30th,

21:42.217 --> 21:45.261
so our wedding party's
gonna be a little uneven.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.889
Peter, l don't care.
l just want you to be happy

21:49.266 --> 21:51.642
and to stop kissing strange men.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.483
Wow, it's really smoky in there.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.277
Yeah, he got up in there.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.903
-Tongue?
-Oh, yeah.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.905
You wouldn't mind brushing your teeth,
would you?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.825
No. l've already done it
a couple of times.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.827
l'll do the mouthwash again.

22:09.911 --> 22:14.206
-There's some Tom's in the top cabinet.
-No, l gotta go with chemicals on this.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.251
-l love you.
-l love you, too. l might use Comet.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.068
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.195
l live down there.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.322
l like it. l'm liking it.

22:46.907 --> 22:47.948
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.533
lt's a good space, you know?
lt's a good vibe.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.160
-Yeah? Terrific.
-Yeah.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.788
Well, when the Santa Anas
come through, it is majestic.

22:53.872 --> 22:54.872
-Thanks.
-l'm excited.

22:54.956 --> 22:55.998
-We'll let you know.
-Okay.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.124
Thank you.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.212
-Hello.
-Hi.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.214
-lf you need any help, just let me know.
-Thanks.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.465
Sure.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.558
Thank you for eating.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.185
-l'm the first one, huh?
-Yeah.

23:16.269 --> 23:19.271
l never understood why people
are so afraid to eat at an open house.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.648
l know.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.733
Why's Ferrigno selling?

23:22.818 --> 23:24.610
He bought a place in Jackson Hole.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.612
Yeah, l think he's tired
of the Hollywood grind.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.738
Right.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.699
You know, l've always wanted a pad
with a giant Lou Ferrigno statue,

23:30.784 --> 23:32.910
so l think l've found it.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.162
He's got one.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.332
You're wasting your time
with that couple. Just FYl.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.376
Why do you say that?

23:40.460 --> 23:43.170
l saw the guy pull in.
He's driving a Saab 9.3,

23:43.255 --> 23:46.590
which, l'm not a snob, it's a great car,
but it costs $30,000.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.969
This house must be,
what, 4, $4.2 million?

23:50.053 --> 23:51.762
Doesn't quite compute, right?

23:51.847 --> 23:55.099
Well, l hope that's not the case.
He told me he was gonna make an offer.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.519
l think he's trying to impress that girl
he hasn't slept with yet.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.271
-The feng shui.
-Yeah.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.107
How do you know that?

24:03.567 --> 24:06.193
Well, it's body language, you know?

24:06.611 --> 24:07.862
Look, that guy needs to fart.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.905
lt's pretty clear,
but he doesn't know her well enough

24:09.990 --> 24:12.575
to do it in front of her,
so l assume they haven't slept together.

24:12.659 --> 24:16.078
-l like it. You okay?
-Yeah, no, l'm fine. l'm good.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.873
-He does seem to be clenching.
-Yeah, he doesn't wanna fart.

24:18.957 --> 24:23.377
Watch. When he gets enough space,
he's gonna let one rip, l guarantee you.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.463
That's a good move.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.798
"Hey, go check out the kitchen, honey.
l'll meet you in there."

24:27.883 --> 24:30.009
-Okay. Yeah.
-Now watch.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.971
He's making his move slowly.
Slowly but surely. Watch the leg.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.475
Wait for it. Wait for it. Fart.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.810
-Boom. That's a fart, motherfucker.
-Oh, my God.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.479
-That's a fucking fart.
-Oh, my God !

24:41.563 --> 24:44.982
Look at him crop-dusting across
your open house. lt's a disgrace.

24:45.066 --> 24:48.235
-He farted in my open house.
-He sure did.

24:49.404 --> 24:50.404
You know what, guy?

24:50.489 --> 24:53.741
l like it, but l'm thinking
it might be a little bit small.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.202
Totally, and it smells like fart.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.536
-What?
-Never mind.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.038
Let's take off, baby. Come on.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.999
Roll down the windows
in that car, sweetheart.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.084
You called that.
That was like a play-by-play.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.377
That's amazing. You called that!

25:05.462 --> 25:07.671
-Yeah. Well, l know my farts.
-Unbelievable.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.424
Well, listen, just full disclosure.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.594
l have no interest in buying this house.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.095
Well, then why are you here?

25:15.180 --> 25:18.098
To eat your free food
and to try to meet a divorcée.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.558
-Are you serious?
-l am.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.019
Yeah. l've found
that at the classy open houses,

25:22.103 --> 25:24.563
the spread is usually pretty decent,

25:24.648 --> 25:28.817
and there's a beautiful bevy of attractive
and newly-single women.

25:29.277 --> 25:33.322
l don't know what to say.
Thank you for your honesty.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.284
Thank you for the sun-dried tomato aioli,
because it's a revelation.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.329
-Wow. Hey, thanks for noticing.
-Yeah.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.331
All right,
l'm gonna take this panini for the road.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.376
There's an open house in Bel Air that
promises to be replete with cougars.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.461
-You don't wanna miss that.
-No, sir.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.588
-lt was nice to meet you. Yeah.
-You, too.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.757
Hey, you know what, here,
let me give you my business card.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.342
-All right.
-ln case you're looking for,

25:53.426 --> 25:54.635
you know, a new home or anything.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.805
l actually specialize in smaller houses,
bungalows, that kind of thing.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.975
-Lovely. Let me give you mine, as well.
-Okay.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.727
-"Sydney Fife."
-That is my name.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.853
There you go.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.814
Well, thank you
for the great open house.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.649
-My plezh. Okay.
-All right.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.360
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too, Sydney.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.575
Hello.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.704
l can't just call him.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.038
Why are you being such a chickenshit?

26:23.123 --> 26:25.374
He gave you his card.
lt's an open invitation.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.792
Engage your core.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.086
lt's beach season. lt's beach season.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.463
l hate this.
There's no rules for male friendships.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.757
What are you freaking out about?
You went out with those other guys.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.261
-l'm really nervous about this one.
-'Cause you really like him.

26:37.345 --> 26:41.307
All right, buddy, great set.
Take five, l'll come rub you down.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.934
Look, if he does call,
no more dinners, okay?

26:44.019 --> 26:46.312
-lt's sending the wrong message.
-l know, l know.

26:46.396 --> 26:50.399
Hey, Peter! l got an extra ticket
to the Galaxy game tonight!

26:50.483 --> 26:55.321
You know what? Thanks, man,
l'm sorry, l can't. l got a function.

26:55.697 --> 26:59.325
l got season ticks.
l'll get you on the flip side. Here we go.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.702
Hey, thanks a lot
for hooking me up with Elmo over there.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.288
-That was a blast.
-What? That guy's cool.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.457
Here we go. Here we go.
Come on, push it out.

27:06.541 --> 27:09.543
Everything you got! Everything you got!
Everything you got!

27:20.472 --> 27:21.680
Yeah.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.515
Just to. . .

27:26.144 --> 27:28.145
Hey. . . Pathetic.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.065
Sydney, how you doing?
lt's Peter Klaven.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.485
Hey, Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.
We met at the open house last week.

27:34.569 --> 27:38.405
Get some guts, would you?
l got some cheese. Give me a break.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.200
No. Oh, my God.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.747
-Hey, Peter.
-Hey, Carolyn.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.294
Sorry.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.838
Fife. You know what to do.

27:54.923 --> 27:58.509
Hey, Peter. lt's Sydney Klaven.
No, that's not right.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.639
Sydney, it's Peter Klaven.

28:03.723 --> 28:07.267
l met you last week at an open house,

28:07.352 --> 28:11.939
and l had a showing and. . .

28:12.774 --> 28:18.278
Anyway, l was wondering
if you ever wanted to get together

28:18.363 --> 28:23.701
and talk about real estate and whatnot.
Or whatnot. And. . .

28:23.785 --> 28:25.577
-Hey, sugar.
-Hey.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.002
l'm sorry, l forgot what l was gonna say.
What was l saying?

28:36.047 --> 28:39.967
Yes, the open house and we met. . .
Anyway, no rush.

28:40.051 --> 28:44.763
You call me back
whenever you get a mo. Get a moment.

28:44.848 --> 28:48.767
And we will talk when l talk to you.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.229
All right.
Hope you're having a great day.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.856
Okay. Bye, now.

29:03.867 --> 29:04.992
Fuck.

29:06.786 --> 29:10.164
l'm fine with a little mercury poisoning
as long as it means l get to eat raw fish,

29:10.248 --> 29:11.915
'cause l love it so much.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.209
My doctor said it's really bad
if you're trying to get pregnant.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.836
l heard that.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.255
Which Barry and l are doing.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.508
Oh, my God, that's so exciting !

29:22.177 --> 29:23.260
-l'm sorry.
-What?

29:23.344 --> 29:25.929
l'm sorry.
l just pictured you and Barry having sex.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.182
And he's so big and you're so tiny,
and l just. . .

29:28.266 --> 29:30.851
-Hailey. . .
-Like, l totally imagined Barry just like. . .

29:30.935 --> 29:31.935
Okay, hold on, wait.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.395
Why are you even imagining us
doing it anyway?

29:33.480 --> 29:35.814
-l'm seeing it again.
-Well, stop! Stop! Cut it!

29:35.899 --> 29:37.191
No, l love Barry.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.567
-Hey!
-Hey!

29:38.651 --> 29:40.486
-Hey! Hey!
-Hi !

29:40.570 --> 29:41.945
-Hi !
-What are you doing here?

29:42.030 --> 29:45.282
l just had a meeting downtown
with the owners of the development site,

29:45.366 --> 29:47.868
so thought l'd stop in
and say hi on my way back to the office.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.329
So, Peter,
how's your little manhunt coming?

29:50.413 --> 29:52.581
Really, you told them? Shocking.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.041
Well, l mean, Barry and his friends

29:54.125 --> 29:56.001
said they had a great time with you
the other night.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.628
-Seriously?
-No.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.047
Well, l just. . .
l don't drink that much and they pound.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.215
They were pounding drinks.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.800
Yeah, you're not used to drinking
that much.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.010
Excuse me just a second.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.555
Peter Klaven.

30:10.225 --> 30:13.894
Excuse me just one. . .
Hey, Sydney. How are you?

30:14.270 --> 30:15.479
ls that a man or a woman?

30:15.563 --> 30:17.564
l don't know. l've never heard of Sydney.

30:18.399 --> 30:22.653
l could be in Venice by 5:00, yeah.
l can do that.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.822
lt's a man-date. lt's a man-date.
This is a man-date.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.407
James' Beach Bar and Grill.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.285
l look forward to it. Sounds great.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.789
All right. l'll see you in a jiff.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.251
-"See you in a jiff"?
-l don't know why l said that.

30:37.335 --> 30:41.004
l've never said that expression before
in my life. l just said, "See you in a jiff."

30:41.089 --> 30:43.674
Honey, you're all flustered.
Who was that?

30:43.758 --> 30:45.843
lt was just this guy
that l met at my open house.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.887
-Sydney something or other.
-Sydney. l like it.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.891
-Oh, my God. Peter's got a boyfriend.
-And l don't.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.518
Oh, God, why does everything
have to be about you?

30:54.602 --> 30:55.310
Because l'm single.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.078
l'm meeting him right now.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.330
Dude, no dinner.
He'II get the wrong idea.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.875
You don't wanna get another
tongue-fucking at the vaIet stand.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.877
Yes, Robbie, l promise. No dinner.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.713
Dude, I'm pumped about this.
CaII me when you get home.

31:22.797 --> 31:23.964
Yeah !

31:24.507 --> 31:26.133
Thank you, bro.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.138
All right, so you break it off
with your ex-girlfriend. . .

31:31.222 --> 31:33.181
Yeah, and l met Zooey
the very next day.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.475
Man, no laj between the vag?

31:36.603 --> 31:39.813
-What does that mean?
-No lag time between vaginas.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.690
Yeah, no. l don't. . .

31:41.774 --> 31:44.401
l mean, l didn't plan for it
to be like that, you know,

31:44.485 --> 31:46.820
with no laj, but it just happened.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.114
All right. How's the sex?

31:49.824 --> 31:52.367
That's a little private, wouldn't you say?

31:52.535 --> 31:55.370
Look, it's something we think about
on a second-to-second basis,

31:55.455 --> 31:58.749
and yet we're not supposed
to talk about it? Why?

31:59.375 --> 32:00.542
Well. . .

32:00.835 --> 32:05.339
l guess no one's ever really asked me
before, but it's good. Sex is good.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.382
-Oh, boy.
-What, "Oh, boy"?

32:07.467 --> 32:09.051
Well, your voice went up
when you said that.

32:09.135 --> 32:10.385
So?

32:10.470 --> 32:13.263
lt means you weren't
being entirely truthful.

32:13.348 --> 32:17.726
Look, l don't know this girl,
so you can talk to me. What's the deal?

32:19.938 --> 32:24.191
l don't know, l guess maybe sometimes
l wish that she enjoyed, you know. . .

32:24.275 --> 32:27.694
-Getting it in the tush?
-No. No, no, no.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.905
-That's my bad.
-Oral sex.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.617
She doesn't like to put it in the mouth?

32:34.869 --> 32:39.164
l can't believe l'm telling you this.
l don't even know you. Forget it. Look.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.125
Zooey's awesome,
and we have a great sex life.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.753
We really do. l can't. . .
l don't even know why l said that.

32:44.837 --> 32:48.882
Because you're speaking honestly,
all right? Relax.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.551
And what about you?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.971
-You ever been married?
-No.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.223
For what l'm looking for,
divorcées are perfect, you know?

32:56.307 --> 32:59.267
They don't want anything serious,
and neither do l.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.187
Well, hey, man.
You know, if it works for you.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.272
Believe me, Pistol, it is the best.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.400
-"Pistol"?
-Yeah. Pistol.

33:07.026 --> 33:10.696
-Because you're Pete. So Pistol Pete.
-Pistol Pete.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.824
Excuse me,
you guys finishing up here soon?

33:14.325 --> 33:16.410
No, sorry, chief,
we're actually staying for dinner.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.162
No, actually, l already have
a dinner plan with my fiancée.

33:19.247 --> 33:22.457
No, dude, this place
has the best fish tacos in the world.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.336
Literally. Ranked.
You gotta have one or two.

33:27.630 --> 33:30.507
lt's the pico de gallo, man.
Just use your hands.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.592
We're barbarians after all, men.

33:32.677 --> 33:36.179
Every once in a while,
l go down to the Boardwalk

33:36.264 --> 33:39.307
and l just throw my own feces
like a gorilla.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.233
You all right?

33:48.776 --> 33:50.986
How can you disagree with me on this?
l mean, look, my. . .

33:51.070 --> 33:52.738
lt's bad for the whole world.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.198
My lease is gonna be up and l think. . .

33:55.283 --> 33:57.701
-Are you talking about hybrid cars?
-Yes. Yes.

33:57.785 --> 34:00.162
l thought you were talking
about hybrid animals.

34:00.246 --> 34:01.621
-Hybrid animals?
-Yeah.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.373
What the fuck is a hybrid animal?

34:03.458 --> 34:06.877
lt took Andre the Giant a barrel of beer
to get drunk, sometimes two.

34:06.961 --> 34:10.213
-"Hello, pretty lady."
-"Anybody want a peanut?"

34:11.924 --> 34:13.382
Should we get a third order
of fish tacos?

34:14.302 --> 34:17.179
Hands down,
best fish taco l've ever had in my life.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.889
God, those tortillas were incredible.

34:18.973 --> 34:22.225
Yeah, they make them in-house.
lt sets up the flavor for the whole dish.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.393
You know what?
l just realized something.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.646
l never even asked you
if you were interested in buying a house.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.107
No. No, why would l be?

34:29.775 --> 34:31.359
Well, it's just when you called me back,

34:31.444 --> 34:33.612
l didn't know if you wanted
to talk about real estate or not.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.905
You just seemed like a good dude.

34:34.989 --> 34:38.241
l thought l'd see if you wanted
to grab a beer. That's all.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.784
l'm glad you called.

34:39.869 --> 34:43.288
-You get home safe, Pistol.
-You got it, Joban.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.956
l'm sorry, what?

34:47.293 --> 34:48.835
Nothing.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.420
-No, what'd you say?
-l don't know.

34:52.297 --> 34:56.051
You. . . You nicknamed me Pistol,
and l just called you Joban.

34:56.469 --> 35:00.806
lt means nothing. l don't. . .
l'm drunk. l'm gonna call a cab.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.226
All right, man.
You have my number, yeah?

35:04.310 --> 35:06.978
l got you stored in my iPhin.

35:07.063 --> 35:10.857
-All right. lf you need me, call, okay?
-Man, l'm golden.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.610
-Yeah. All right, man.
-All right, bud.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.197
Have a good night.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.747
l don't know the number for a taxi.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.880
-Hi, baby.
-Hey.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.466
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah, we did. Yeah.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.803
Sydney's a cool guy. Got kind of drunk.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.140
-Really?
-Yeah, l had to take a cab home.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.809
-Really? Did you. . .
-Throw up in his face?

35:45.893 --> 35:46.977
-Yeah.
-No.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.270
-Good.
-So that's good.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.981
That's good. So is he your best man?

35:51.399 --> 35:55.068
lt's way too early to tell,
but it's very sweet of you to ask.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.571
Go back to sleep.
l'll be in, in a second, all right?

35:57.655 --> 35:59.322
l just wanna see
if l got any hits on Ferrigno.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.574
Okay.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.000
-Whoomp! There he is! There he is!
-Stop it. Stop it.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.376
-Ass, ass and titties.
-Stop it. Fucking stop it.

36:11.460 --> 36:14.921
-Fuck, l'm ticklish, Tevin.
-Okay. Uncle. Uncle.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.591
Hey. How was the open hizzy?

36:17.675 --> 36:19.426
-The what?
-The open house.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.052
The open house. lt was great.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.847
-Yeah? Did you flip that bitch yet?
-Yeah.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.141
No. l mean, l've had a few nibbles.
No bites.

36:26.225 --> 36:29.019
Nibbles? Me no likey nibbles.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.980
-Peter, can l talk to you as a friend?
-Sure.

36:32.064 --> 36:35.192
You're dealing with the house
of a major Hollywood celebrity,

36:35.276 --> 36:38.695
Mr. Louis Ferrigno,
The Hulk from television.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.864
Of course. l know that.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.240
How badly
do you wanna sell this house?

36:42.325 --> 36:44.951
-l need to. You know, for. . .
-l know you need to.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.369
You gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.955
You gotta network.
You gotta meet a lot of people.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.458
You gotta get them some leave-behinds.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.544
-l have brochures.
-Brochures are totally different, okay?

36:54.629 --> 36:56.880
-How?
-You see this picture right here?

36:56.964 --> 36:58.381
-Yeah.
-Do you know who took it?

36:58.466 --> 37:00.175
-No.
-M. Night Shyamalan,

37:00.259 --> 37:02.636
the director of The Village.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.096
-Okay.
-What's your bus-bench ad situation?

37:05.181 --> 37:08.016
-l don't have any.
-What about urinal cakes?

37:08.100 --> 37:10.000
-How about urinal cakes?
-Do you use them?

Urinal cakes with my face on it.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.742
Does it. . . l don't see how that would. . .

37:25.826 --> 37:27.494
l've had people come up to me
on the streets and say,

37:27.578 --> 37:29.037
"l know you from somewhere."

37:29.121 --> 37:31.081
"Yeah, you do.
You pissed on my face, friend."

37:31.165 --> 37:33.583
l don't see how
having somebody piss on my face

37:33.668 --> 37:36.086
is gonna be able to sell
Lou Ferrigno's house.

37:36.170 --> 37:40.799
Peter, you got the steak,
but l got the sizzle, my nizzle. Right?

37:41.259 --> 37:42.968
Why don't we split the listing. Okay?

37:43.052 --> 37:46.638
Let me wet my beak on this action.
We'll both be winners.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.641
l appreciate it, but l'd really like to try
and do this myself.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.811
Yeah. Absolutely.
l'm just putting on my friend hat here.

37:52.895 --> 37:55.897
-l appreciate it. All right.
-Whoomp! There he is!

37:57.233 --> 38:00.026
-Oh, jeez.
-Watch yourself, big girl.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.126
-Fife.
-Hey, Sydney. lt's the Pistol.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.461
Who?

38:18.546 --> 38:22.549
Peter Klaven from
the James' Beach thing the other night.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.634
Hey, yeah, what's going on, man?

38:24.719 --> 38:28.054
Yeah. Not much. l'm working like a dog.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.058
But, you know, usual. . . The yoozh stuff.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.645
I was just caIIing to say, hey,
I had a great time the other night.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.898
Yeah, l had a nice time, man.
Those fish tacos are the tits.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.485
Yeah, you know, if you ever wanna
grab lunch or something, nothing major.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.112
Yeah. Actually, you know what?
l'm gonna take my puggle

38:44.196 --> 38:46.031
for a little jaunt
on the Venice Boardwalk.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.367
-You shouId come meet me.
-All right. Yeah, great.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.995
Cool. Why don't you meet me
at Muscle Beach at like,

38:52.079 --> 38:54.289
-l don't know, in a half an hour?
-Muscle Beach, half an hour.

38:54.373 --> 38:58.084
l will see you there,
or l will see you on another time.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.046
That was very confusing.
I don't know if you're gonna come or not.

39:01.130 --> 39:04.632
-No, l'll be there. l'll be there.
-AII right, I'II see you then, buddy.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.594
All right. Laters on the menjay.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.850
What did l just say?

39:14.185 --> 39:16.519
He's a cross
between a beagle and a pug.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.773
-The most beautiful dog in the world.
-He's cute. What's his name?

39:19.857 --> 39:21.191
Anwar Sadat,

39:21.275 --> 39:24.361
after Anwar Sadat,
former president of Egypt.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.030
Right.
Because you're a fan of his policies or. . .

39:27.114 --> 39:29.616
No, because they look exactly alike.

39:33.412 --> 39:36.039
Hey, so how's Ferrigno coming?
You got any offers yet?

39:36.123 --> 39:37.582
Not yet, no.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.796
This guy that l work with, Tevin Downey,
he wants to share the listing with me.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.339
What? And split the commission?

39:44.423 --> 39:46.341
What about the land
you told me you wanted to buy?

39:46.425 --> 39:50.637
lt would put a delay on that,
but l gotta sell the place, you know?

39:50.721 --> 39:53.556
Tevin's a total cheeseball,
but he markets himself like crazy.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.184
He's on bus-bench ads all over town.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.728
You know,
he says the place is out of my league.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.647
Hey, that is bullshit. All right?

40:00.731 --> 40:03.900
That open house was understated.
lt was classy and elegant.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.152
l've been to a million of those things
and nobody,

40:06.237 --> 40:08.863
nobody puts out
rosemary flatbread paninis.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.408
Now hold on, my dog needs to shit.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.618
Well, l'm trying to sell the place,
believe me, but. . .

40:13.702 --> 40:17.372
Hey, no, Pete.
Trying is having the intention to fail.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.749
You gotta scrap that word
from your vocab.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.544
Say you're gonna do it and you will.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.921
Come on, buddy. Good boy.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.717
-You need a plastic bag or. . .
-No, l don't clean up after my dog.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.553
Dog poop is like a compost.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.555
lt's got a ton of nutrients
that enrich the soil.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.848
But we're on pavement.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.976
God damn it!
How about cleaning up after your dog?

40:38.060 --> 40:40.186
You mind your own fuckhole!

40:43.023 --> 40:45.483
What the fuck? Psycho.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.739
What was that?

40:51.824 --> 40:52.949
l'm a man, Peter.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.827
l've got an ocean of testosterone
flowing through my veins.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.621
Society tells us to act civilized,
but the truth is we're animals,

40:58.706 --> 41:01.332
and sometimes you gotta let it out.
Try it.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.463
l'm not gonna start screaming
in the middle of the Venice Boardwalk.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.006
Come with me.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.720
-This is silly.
-lndulge me.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.724
That was really good.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.727
Now gently remove your tampon
and try again.

41:25.065 --> 41:26.274
Respect the process.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.276
Why do you wanna mock the process?

41:28.360 --> 41:29.652
-Because it doesn't do anything.
-No.

41:29.737 --> 41:32.614
lf you don't yell,
l'm gonna punch you in your stomach.

41:37.912 --> 41:41.289
That was really good, man.
That was terrifying.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.291
You just scared my dog.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.677
-Yeah? You feel better?
-Yeah.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.887
-Want to get a corn dog?
-Yeah !

41:55.971 --> 41:57.263
Let's go.

42:02.978 --> 42:07.315
. . .the span of this, like, l don't know,
30 pages. lt's insane. lt's crazy.

42:07.399 --> 42:10.485
l know. l read it in college, and l loved it.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.487
What a great house.

42:12.571 --> 42:14.531
Thanks, man.
Yeah, come check out the back.

42:14.615 --> 42:15.782
Yeah.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.911
-This is a bumper car l got on eBay.
-Wow.

42:19.995 --> 42:22.413
l was in a bidding war
with CarnivalKid 32,

42:22.498 --> 42:25.291
so l had to go on the "Buy lt Now" price,
but l got it.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.918
-Coolness.
-And you remember Marlena.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.044
Hey, Lenish.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.796
Now let's check out
the piéce de résistance, bitch.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.590
l wanna do it. Separate garage.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.759
-Mr. Klaven.
-Very nice.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.470
Welcome to the Temple of Doom.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.473
Holy shit, Sydney. This place is insane.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.059
Holy fuck. Oh, my God.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.145
-Thanks, man. l try.
-This is amazing.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.231
-Thank you, sir.
-You got some TVs.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.941
l do. l do.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.985
Photographs.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.863
-Beer?
-l'll snake a brew.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.157
-Put on some tunes.
-ls that you?

42:58.409 --> 43:01.160
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me in ninth grade, man.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.913
-Are you that little kid?
-Yeah, l was a late bloomer.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.665
"Wrecking Crew."

43:05.833 --> 43:08.126
-Come and take a load off, bud.
-Oh, man.

43:08.210 --> 43:09.836
Pop a squizz nut.

43:14.508 --> 43:16.634
What's going on over there?

43:17.344 --> 43:19.178
This is where l jerk off.

43:20.556 --> 43:24.142
And the condoms?

43:24.893 --> 43:28.062
-l wear them when l masturbate.
-Are you kidding me?

43:28.355 --> 43:29.647
l always get this reaction,

43:29.732 --> 43:33.610
but the fact is they decrease sensitivity
so l can last longer.

43:33.694 --> 43:36.362
And there's no sticky mess to clean up.

43:38.866 --> 43:42.619
And when your divorcées come over,
you put them away?

43:43.203 --> 43:46.873
Pete, this is the man cave.
There's no women allowed in here.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.667
l got a jerk-off station, for God's sakes.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.252
Sit down, man.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.714
What about when your guy friends
come over? Aren't you embarrassed?

43:54.798 --> 43:59.385
Masturbation is a part of life, Pete.
Dudes masturbate. So do chicks.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.472
You never talked about masturbating
with your friends?

44:02.556 --> 44:04.140
-No, l haven't.
-All right.

44:04.224 --> 44:06.184
When was the last time you did it, Pete?

44:06.268 --> 44:07.435
l'm not gonna tell you that.

44:07.519 --> 44:10.229
Hey. Listen, you think of this place
as a Cone of Silence, all right?

44:10.314 --> 44:13.232
l'm not gonna tell anybody
any of the things you say in here.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.984
You have my word.

44:18.614 --> 44:23.368
Zooey went to the Pasadena flea market
with her friends last weekend,

44:23.452 --> 44:25.244
and l did it then.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.205
Well, that sounds lovely.

44:27.289 --> 44:29.832
What'd you use? lnternet or DVD?

44:29.917 --> 44:32.043
How do you get me
to tell you these things?

44:32.127 --> 44:33.378
Come on.

44:34.922 --> 44:36.964
l used a picture of Zooey in a bikini

44:37.049 --> 44:39.217
that l took when we were on vacation
in Cabo San Lucas.

44:39.301 --> 44:42.428
Wait, you jacked off
to a picture of your own girlfriend?

44:42.513 --> 44:45.014
You. . . That. . . Wow. That is sick.

44:45.099 --> 44:47.809
Oh, my God ! What is wrong with you?

44:47.893 --> 44:48.935
What's wrong with that?

44:49.019 --> 44:53.523
Pedro, there is so much wrong with that,
l don't even know where to begin. lt's. . .

44:55.693 --> 44:58.611
-That is sick, man.
-Someone's ears were burning.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.698
Heard you say you jacked off
to her picture, sicko.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.116
Hey, babe.

45:04.618 --> 45:07.537
Good. Yeah, l'm over here at Sydney's.
We're just chillaxing.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.539
We're in the chill station.

45:09.623 --> 45:12.458
Yeah, l'm kind of playing hooky
from work.

45:13.335 --> 45:15.712
No, l'll see you at home later on.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.672
Love you, too. Bye-bye.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.510
Hey, why'd you tell her
you bailed from work?

45:22.594 --> 45:24.262
l didn't wanna lie to her.

45:24.346 --> 45:27.014
You're one of the most honest people
l've ever met. You can understand that.

45:27.099 --> 45:28.433
Yeah, l never lie to women,

45:28.517 --> 45:32.103
but, l mean, there are some things
l choose not to share with them.

45:32.187 --> 45:35.022
-l don't really see the distinction.
-Really?

45:35.107 --> 45:38.568
So you've told Zooey that you jacked off
to her picture last weekend.

45:38.652 --> 45:39.777
Well, no, but. . .

45:39.862 --> 45:42.447
All right. Well, you shared
that information with me, didn't you?

45:42.531 --> 45:45.533
So there are dividing lines.
That's all l'm trying to say.

45:45.617 --> 45:47.118
Like, l love to take a girl out to dinner,

45:47.202 --> 45:49.078
but l'm not gonna go golf 1 8 holes
with her.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.998
You know what? Zooey and l played golf
together a couple of months ago.

45:52.082 --> 45:55.752
-lt was really fun.
-That sounds like a fucking nightmare.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.922
What do you play?

46:00.549 --> 46:04.093
l play a little bit of everything,
but if l had to narrow it down to one,

46:04.178 --> 46:06.137
l guess l'd say l'm an axman.

46:06.513 --> 46:09.182
-Sweet. Guitar.
-What about you? You play anything?

46:09.266 --> 46:13.936
l used to slap the bass
in a high school jazz band.

46:15.063 --> 46:17.774
-All right.
-Rush. l love Rush.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.942
Dude, Rush is the greatest band
of all time.

46:20.027 --> 46:24.155
Yeah, no, how about of all time?
All time.

46:25.282 --> 46:28.576
You know what? We should
jam together sometime, man.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.329
Yeah. Totally.

46:31.872 --> 46:34.540
Totes McGotes. Cool.

46:41.215 --> 46:44.300
Well, you know what?
l should probably hit it to it.

46:44.551 --> 46:46.594
All right, yeah.
l gotta get to bed early, anyway.

46:46.678 --> 46:49.055
l'm doing a big day hike
with my buddies in Malibu tomorrow.

46:49.139 --> 46:51.682
Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. lt was a really. . .
lt was a good hang.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.893
-Yeah.
-Sweet, sweet hanging.

46:56.396 --> 46:59.690
-Well, adiós, Pistol.
-Take it easy, Siddy Slicker.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.528
-l'm sorry.
-What?

47:04.488 --> 47:06.697
l called you Siddy Slicker.

47:07.032 --> 47:08.533
-That sucks.
-No, it was pretty close.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.785
lt's a lame nickname.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.079
l thought it was good.
lt was better than Joban.

47:13.163 --> 47:16.332
Yeah, right. l'm gonna get it.
l'll get a better one.

47:16.416 --> 47:18.167
-Dude, it was fine.
-l'm gonna get you.

47:18.252 --> 47:21.337
-Get out of here. Get out of here.
-l'm gonna get you, sucka.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.214
Later on, my. . .

47:28.095 --> 47:31.264
Peter, I have a Lou Ferrigno for you
on Iine three.

47:37.312 --> 47:38.938
Put him through.

47:41.775 --> 47:44.026
Mr. Ferrigno. Hey, it's Peter Klaven.

47:44.111 --> 47:46.028
Peter, what the heII's going on?

47:46.113 --> 47:48.865
Yeah. lf you just go past the first area
to the left, he's right there.

47:48.949 --> 47:52.034
-Sure. What's your name?
-Leanne.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.161
Leanne. That was my mother's name.

47:54.246 --> 47:57.164
-Really?
-l don't know. Was it?

47:58.667 --> 48:00.418
Peter, it's been on the market
for three weeks...

48:00.502 --> 48:02.211
-Yes.
-...and we haven't gotten one offer.

48:02.296 --> 48:05.298
And that's why we're having another
open house this weekend.

48:05.382 --> 48:07.174
Hello, mystery woman.

48:08.093 --> 48:10.511
l think it was very beneficial,
very beneficial.

48:10.596 --> 48:12.388
BeneficiaI? It was beneficiaI?

48:12.472 --> 48:14.390
So you're teIIing me
we're gonna seII this house?

48:14.474 --> 48:17.184
Absolutely,
and l've gotten many nibbles this week.

48:17.269 --> 48:18.311
-NibbIes?
-Yes, sir.

48:18.395 --> 48:19.979
It's aII about food with you, Peter.

48:20.063 --> 48:22.565
No one cares about
the stupid sandwiches you put out.

48:22.649 --> 48:25.568
No, sir. No, l absolutely agree with you.

48:25.652 --> 48:28.571
You want to sell a house
and not a panini.

48:28.655 --> 48:30.448
-Paninis? Paninis?
-Yes, sir.

48:30.532 --> 48:31.574
Don't make him angry.

48:31.658 --> 48:33.659
Enough with the coId cuts,
the condiments.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.412
-You wouldn't like him when he's angry.
-What the heII you think this is?

48:36.496 --> 48:39.165
No, l understand.
lt's an open house and not a deli.

48:39.249 --> 48:43.377
-Peter? HeIIo? You need to focus.
-Yeah. Yep. l think. . .

48:43.462 --> 48:45.296
-l think. . .
-Let peopIe know my house is for saIe.

48:45.380 --> 48:48.549
Forget about the sandwiches
and focus on seIIing my fucking house.

48:48.634 --> 48:50.593
-Let's do this, okay?
-Yes, sir.

48:50.677 --> 48:51.761
-Okay?
-Okay.

48:51.845 --> 48:54.639
-Goodbye.
-All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.433
You all right?

48:57.517 --> 48:59.435
-Hulk busting your balls?
-Yeah.

48:59.519 --> 49:02.897
-What are you doing here?
-My blood bank's a few blocks away.

49:02.981 --> 49:06.984
l'm AB negative. lt's extremely rare,
so l try to donate every couple of weeks.

49:07.069 --> 49:08.486
That's really nice, Sydney.

49:08.570 --> 49:11.614
There's also this nurse there
who l wanna fuck so badly.

49:11.698 --> 49:14.659
Oh, boy, here we go.
Should have guessed.

49:16.244 --> 49:18.579
Hey, weren't you supposed to go hiking
with your friends today?

49:18.664 --> 49:21.290
Yeah, a couple of them had to bail,
but we'll reschedule.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.542
Anyway, listen, l got a house full
of leftover Koo Koo Roo,

49:23.627 --> 49:25.544
so l was thinking maybe you
and me could go grab some lunch

49:25.629 --> 49:27.964
and squeeze in a little jam session?

49:28.048 --> 49:29.340
Leftover Koo Koo Roo?

49:29.424 --> 49:32.134
Well, that sounds
about as appetizing as

49:32.219 --> 49:36.013
a big pile of. . .
A plate of dirt, or something.

49:37.349 --> 49:38.766
l'm. . . l was. . . l'm kidding.

49:38.850 --> 49:42.019
Yeah. l still want to hang out
despite that joke.

49:42.604 --> 49:45.898
-That was a bad joke.
-Yeah. You're better than that.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.162
That's it.

50:00.914 --> 50:03.082
-How's that feel?
-lt feels tasty.

50:03.166 --> 50:06.419
-Yeah? You sound pretty good, buddy.
-Thanks, man.

50:06.503 --> 50:08.045
Here we go.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.564
Wow, that's a good one, bud.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.191
Hey, check out these two.

50:29.276 --> 50:33.863
l call them bowsers. lt's my nickname
for people who look just like their dog.

50:33.947 --> 50:35.031
Good boy.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.033
Bowsers?
Where'd you come up with that?

50:37.117 --> 50:38.659
lt sounded right.

50:38.744 --> 50:42.288
Shit. Hey, geek!
l just stepped in your dog's shit.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.583
Now l'm gonna make you eat it.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.585
Peter, run !

50:47.794 --> 50:49.128
-Yeah !
-Take it.

50:56.428 --> 50:59.680
lt's a bit of a throwback, but it comes
with the built-ins. lt's wired for sound.

50:59.765 --> 51:01.891
This is fun.
This is a pair of jeans that he actually. . .

51:01.975 --> 51:03.976
This house is exquisite.

51:04.978 --> 51:07.021
l'd like to make an offer.

51:09.149 --> 51:11.025
What do you think, hon?

51:21.787 --> 51:25.456
Yeah, l don't like that,
but for the most part, l mean. . .

51:25.749 --> 51:26.874
-Take it.
-Really?

51:26.958 --> 51:28.459
Yeah, take it.

51:29.836 --> 51:31.712
Sydney, what's up, man?

51:32.506 --> 51:35.132
What happened? What?

51:35.717 --> 51:37.343
Shut up! No.

51:37.552 --> 51:40.346
Did it smell weird? ls it discolored?

51:51.274 --> 51:52.817
Shut the fuck up!

51:52.901 --> 51:55.277
So how long have you guys
known Sydney?

51:55.362 --> 51:56.654
-lt feels like forever.
-What?

51:56.738 --> 51:58.989
Remember that time
we tripped acid together

51:59.074 --> 52:02.618
-and he made us watch the news?
-That was a remarkable night.

52:02.702 --> 52:04.745
-Dude. Dude. Don't. Dude.
-Don't be scared.

52:04.830 --> 52:07.039
-Stop it. Stop it. Drive! Drive!
-Don't lean ! Don't lean !

52:10.710 --> 52:11.794
Yeah, Pistol.

52:12.045 --> 52:14.505
Dude, Peter is on fire.

52:18.927 --> 52:20.928
-Boo-yah ! Yeah !
-Fuck me raw!

52:21.012 --> 52:23.013
That's what l'm talking about.

52:23.098 --> 52:25.391
-Sweet lunge, Peter.
-Yeah, Pete.

52:25.475 --> 52:26.642
Suck it, Gil !

52:31.231 --> 52:32.565
l love it!

52:33.108 --> 52:34.733
Marvin Berry.

52:35.861 --> 52:39.071
"You remember
that new sound you were looking for?"

52:48.582 --> 52:49.748
Pete!

52:51.626 --> 52:53.502
-Are you all right?
-My fucking ass.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.588
-Hey, you did great today though, man.
-You did. You made it up.

52:55.672 --> 52:58.215
-l made it to the top. First time.
-Good job, bro.

52:58.383 --> 53:00.759
-Hey, nice meeting you.
-Yeah, nice meeting you guys.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.720
-All righty, Syd.
-Wait, where you going?

53:02.804 --> 53:04.930
lt's Sunday night.
Tina's nephews are coming over.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.141
We're gonna watch
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.185
No, it's just, l thought
we were all gonna have dinner together,

53:09.269 --> 53:11.020
so l ordered us a 6-foot sub.

53:11.104 --> 53:13.814
But l gotta bolt, too. l promised the kids
l'd take them to Cheeseria.

53:13.899 --> 53:14.940
A little pizza action.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.359
Yeah, well, l'm just gonna be stuck
at home grading papers tonight,

53:17.444 --> 53:19.236
but thanks anyway. All right?

53:19.321 --> 53:20.821
Fun day, guys.

53:22.490 --> 53:25.034
-Pete?
-Man, you know, on Sunday night,

53:25.118 --> 53:27.286
Zooey and l usually watch HBO.

53:27.454 --> 53:29.455
Right. Yeah, yeah, of course. Cool.

53:29.539 --> 53:32.666
But l can't let you eat
a 6-foot sub all by yourself.

53:33.001 --> 53:34.043
-Do you want some?
-No,

53:34.127 --> 53:36.420
l had like a foot and a half
back at Sydney's. l'm golden.

53:36.504 --> 53:40.216
So, what do you guys do for, like,
seven straight hours?

53:40.300 --> 53:43.469
Whatever. l mean, like, we'll just
hang out, you know. Shoot the shit.

53:43.553 --> 53:45.262
Sometimes we jam a little bit.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.389
-You play an instrument?
-Yeah.

53:47.474 --> 53:49.350
l can't believe l've never told you.
l play bass.

53:49.434 --> 53:52.728
-Really?
-Yeah. l slap the bass big time.

53:52.812 --> 53:55.981
What do you. . . What is that?
You sound like a leprechaun.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.775
-No, that's a reggae guy.
-What is that?

53:57.859 --> 53:59.777
-l just did reggae.
-lt doesn't sound. . .

53:59.861 --> 54:01.070
-lt doesn't sound reggae?
-No.

54:01.154 --> 54:03.113
-Slap the bass.
-No.

54:04.074 --> 54:07.034
-How does it. . .
-lt's like, big time, big time.

54:07.118 --> 54:10.079
-Big time.
-Big time. Slap the bass big time.

54:10.914 --> 54:12.539
Slap the bass.

54:12.624 --> 54:14.041
-That sounded like Borat.
-Yeah.

54:14.125 --> 54:17.670
-Slap the bass. Big time.
-That's better. That's better.

54:17.754 --> 54:19.588
Syd and l have gotten pretty good
at a couple of Rush songs.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.840
What do you mean, like,
fast-paced rock?

54:21.925 --> 54:24.593
No, like, Rush. Like the band Rush.

54:24.678 --> 54:27.054
-l don't know them. The. . .
-The holy triumvirate.

54:27.138 --> 54:29.265
-Wait, you don't know Rush?
-No.

54:29.349 --> 54:31.850
-You don't know Rush, the band?
-No.

54:31.935 --> 54:34.853
-"Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer"?
-No!

54:35.355 --> 54:39.108
All right, l'm gonna hit you up
with a little iTunes acción.

54:39.192 --> 54:41.235
l cannot believe
you've never heard Rush.

54:41.319 --> 54:44.571
So when am l gonna meet this guy
who's stolen you away from me?

54:44.739 --> 54:45.781
Pretty soon, actually.

54:45.865 --> 54:47.116
l invited him
to that little engagement party

54:47.200 --> 54:48.492
my parents are throwing for us.

54:48.576 --> 54:51.453
Wow, Peter! This is serious.

54:51.538 --> 54:53.998
lt's mellow. Besides,
l wanted to introduce him to Hailey.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.834
-That's interesting. Yeah, l like that.
-Right?

54:56.918 --> 54:59.837
Hey, let me ask you something.
Are you ready to get your world rocked?

54:59.921 --> 55:02.131
Ready! Yes.

55:02.465 --> 55:04.925
-Are you ready to get your mind blown?
-Do it!

55:05.010 --> 55:07.428
Do you want to get some Neil Peart
all up in you?

55:07.512 --> 55:08.929
l don't know.

55:09.389 --> 55:13.517
Well, prepare to be Rushified !

55:20.567 --> 55:23.819
-Sounds better on big speakers.
-l could see that.

55:28.241 --> 55:30.034
-Good, right?
-Yeah.

55:32.245 --> 55:36.457
-Do you do it that high when you do it?
-Well, in real life, l do it low.

55:36.541 --> 55:39.335
-But air bass works best up here.
-Right.

55:41.046 --> 55:44.006
This is exactly what l look like
when l jam out, man.

55:44.090 --> 55:46.050
When l jam with my bass.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.596
Slap the bass, man.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.681
-There you go. There you go.
-l'm slapping the bass, man.

55:52.766 --> 55:56.602
Slap the bass, man. l slap the bass.

55:56.686 --> 55:57.853
Please don't do that.

55:57.937 --> 55:59.980
-Slap the bass.
-Please?

56:00.065 --> 56:01.357
Slap the bass.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.859
-For the sake of our relationship.
-Slap that bass.

56:03.943 --> 56:07.363
Please stop. Please. Please stop!
Thank you.

56:07.447 --> 56:09.365
l'm slapping the bass.

56:15.955 --> 56:18.207
l'm so glad
you're celebrating at my restaurant.

56:18.291 --> 56:20.209
Of course, Mr. Chu.
We wouldn't go anywhere else.

56:20.293 --> 56:22.920
Hey, this is my brother, Robbie.
Robbie, this is Sydney.

56:23.004 --> 56:25.631
-Hey, Bro Namath.
-Nice. Nice to meet you.

56:25.715 --> 56:29.134
-Peter, you remember Alan.
-From the gym.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.555
-Yeah, hey, man.
-Hi, good to see you again.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.516
-Alan, l'm Sydney.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.725
lt's a pleasure, man.

56:36.810 --> 56:38.143

We're gonna grab some drinks.

56:38.228 --> 56:41.230

56:41.314 --> 56:43.148

Sydney, l'm so happy to meet you.
l've heard so many great things.

56:51.699 --> 56:53.033
Same here. And let me tell you,

56:53.118 --> 56:56.245
this guy, he's gaga over you.
lt's adorable.

56:56.329 --> 56:57.413
-Honestly.
-lt's true. lt's true.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.790
-lt's true.
-Guilty as charged.

56:59.874 --> 57:01.417
Hailey. Hailey.

57:02.585 --> 57:05.337
Sydney, this is my oldest friend
in the world, Hailey.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.631
-All right.
-Hi. l'm good.

57:09.426 --> 57:10.000
You didn't ask, but l'm good.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.260
You're Watching 123Movies.to
You didn't ask, but l'm good.

57:11.260 --> 57:11.344
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:11.344 --> 57:13.095
-Nice to meet you, Sydney.
-lt's a pleasure.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:13.095 --> 57:13.596
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:13.596 --> 57:16.181
Great. l told you we were early.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.181 --> 57:16.266
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.266 --> 57:17.724
-Would you shut up?
-lt's supposed to be. . .
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.724 --> 57:17.809
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.809 --> 57:19.393
The minute we get in
you have to start bitching already?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.393 --> 57:19.477
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.477 --> 57:20.686
-You told me it was a drop-by.
-You know what?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.686 --> 57:20.770
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.770 --> 57:22.000
-This isn't a drop-by.
-This is not a drop-by.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:22.271
-This isn't a drop-by.
-This is not a drop-by.

57:22.355 --> 57:23.939
lt's a damn engagement party.
What is wrong with you?

57:24.023 --> 57:25.023
Can l have a Belvedere on the rocks,

57:25.108 --> 57:26.108
-please?
-You're such an asshole.

57:26.192 --> 57:27.609
Could you just shut up
and not talk to people tonight?

57:27.694 --> 57:28.735
And something
with sour mix in it for her.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.446
l'm sorry they didn't cater this to you
and your liking.

57:30.530 --> 57:31.697
-Hey, guys.
-No. . .

57:31.781 --> 57:33.740
-Hi, you look beautiful !
-Hey.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.409
-Hello, sweetie. How you doing, baby?
-Hi.

57:35.493 --> 57:36.952
-Thanks for coming.
-Hi.

57:37.036 --> 57:38.620
-You guys know each other.
-How you doing? Yeah, we do.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.914
-Yeah.
-Yeah. So. . .

57:41.791 --> 57:44.793
-What do you got there?
-Sex on the beach. Yeah.

57:45.378 --> 57:48.213
You never know! Gotta be prepared.

57:48.673 --> 57:49.840
-The possibility.
-Wow.

57:49.924 --> 57:52.301
l'm just saying, you know.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.470
-What is going on over there?
-Yeah, let me tell you.

57:54.554 --> 57:55.971
-ls that her date?
-l'll give you the whole lowdown.

57:56.055 --> 57:57.473
Should we. . .

58:01.102 --> 58:02.436
What's up?

58:02.645 --> 58:05.564
Hey, l don't remember.
Do you play an instrument?

58:05.648 --> 58:08.484
-No.
-Because Syd and l, my buddy Sydney,

58:08.568 --> 58:12.821
-we've been jamming a lot. . .
-l don't play any instruments.

58:12.906 --> 58:16.783
l slap some bass,
and then Sydney's an axman.

58:16.868 --> 58:18.952
'Cause l was gonna say
if you wanted to jam with us,

58:19.037 --> 58:21.914
you know, that'd be cool.
But you don't have. . .

58:21.998 --> 58:23.916
You have a piano in your house, though,
don't you?

58:24.000 --> 58:27.503
-Yeah, l don't play.
-Really? Why do you have a piano?

58:27.754 --> 58:29.880
The decorator put it there.

58:30.423 --> 58:33.675
Your. . . Does he. . . l thought. . .
No one plays?

58:33.760 --> 58:36.053
-l'm gonna go check on the table.
-All right. Yep.

58:36.137 --> 58:37.721
-Hi. l'm Denise.
-Hi.

58:37.805 --> 58:39.014
-Denise.
-l'm Zooey's friend.

58:39.098 --> 58:40.224
l've heard so much about you.

58:40.308 --> 58:42.518
-lt smells like a fucking pet shop in here.
-Hi. How are you? Okay.

58:42.602 --> 58:45.771
-Mrs. Klaven, the banquet room is ready.
-And who's Mr. Sunshine here?

58:45.855 --> 58:48.023
Hi. This is my husband, Barry.

58:48.107 --> 58:50.526
Come on back, everybody.
The banquet room is ready.

58:50.610 --> 58:54.029
Well, l'm filling myself up.
l need to undo my pants.

58:55.323 --> 58:57.950
There's a lot of protein, but l love it.

58:59.994 --> 59:05.207
lf l may, l think it's only fitting
that we're eating tonight at Hop Louie's

59:05.291 --> 59:09.795
because this is, after all, Peter's favorite
restaurant to bring all of his dates.

59:10.421 --> 59:13.715
So of course he would bring Zooey here
their first night out.

59:13.800 --> 59:17.010
-Just like the rest of them.
-No.

59:18.304 --> 59:20.806
l remember that night when Peter
got home, he called me and he said,

59:20.890 --> 59:23.892
"Mom, this is the girl l'm gonna marry."

59:26.104 --> 59:30.190
And it's not just because she wanted
an extra order of slippery shrimp.

59:30.275 --> 59:31.775
On the first date?

59:31.859 --> 59:34.027
-Hey, now.
-Sometimes.

59:35.071 --> 59:38.240
But the point is,
here we are eight months later.

59:38.825 --> 59:40.450
Peter, Zooey,

59:42.495 --> 59:43.829
we love you,

59:44.831 --> 59:47.499
and we wish only the best for you both.

59:50.044 --> 59:51.420
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

59:51.504 --> 59:52.963
-To Peter and Zooey.
-Cheers.

59:53.047 --> 59:55.173
-Cheers.
-Thanks, Mom.

59:55.967 --> 59:57.551
-Cheers, bro.
-Thanks.

59:57.635 --> 59:59.595
Well, l promised Denise
we'd be gone after appetizers, so. . .

59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.972
You know what?
l'd actually like to just say a few words

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:04.558
-if it's cool with the table.
-Wow.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:12.441
What an honor it is to be sitting here
with Peter and Zooey's friends, family,

01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:17.613
Hailey, Robbie's lover,
Robbie, Oz, Joyce.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.574
Thank you
for hosting this beautiful dinner.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.620
You got this guy
with the smoking hot wife.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.998
And finally, we got Zooey.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:32.336
Zooey, you are about to marry
one of the most honest,

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.340
kind and fun-loving people
l've ever had the honor of knowing.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.509
The Pistol is a pleasure-giver,
that's for sure.

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.970
Yeah. A fucking puke pistol.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:45.599
And the thing about a man like that,
a man like Peter,

01:00:45.683 --> 01:00:48.769
is that he never asks
for anything in return,

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.812
and that's why l'm here.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:55.025
l'm here as Peter's friend,
as Peter's confidant,

01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:59.905
just to say to you, beautiful Zooey,

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:04.368
give it back. Yeah?

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.416
Return the favor.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.587
And if you do,

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:20.509
l guarantee that you will have a beautiful
and pleasure-filled union.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:22.969
-l don't think she sucks his dick.
-Watch your mouth.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:26.765
With that, l'd like to raise a glass
to Pete and Zooey.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.018
Cheers.

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:32.646
-Peter and Zooey.
-Cheers.

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:40.278
What the hell did you tell Sydney
about me?

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.613
Nothing.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.866
l mean, aside from how much l love you.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:48.161
So, what was with all that
pleasure-giver stuff?

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:51.331
l don't. . .

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.710
l might have mentioned in passing
or something

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:58.046
that you don't like doing oral sex.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:03.218
-Peter, that stuff is private.
-ls it? Really?

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:06.096
And telling Hailey and Denise
about the hot tub in Mexico isn't?

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.807
-That is so different. They're. . .
-What? How?

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.642
-l've known them forever.
-So?

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.561
Peter, see, Sydney's like a stranger.

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:14.563
Hardly. He's become
a really good friend of mine,

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.565
and now you know how l feel
when there's no privacy

01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:19.568
-between you and your girlfriends.
-l thought you loved those guys.

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:20.944
l do, l love them, but, you know,

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:24.197
some things l want to remain
between you and me.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:28.410
Okay. Okay.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:38.003
By the way,
it's not that l don't like doing it.

01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:43.175
lt's just that
Rodney just hated getting them.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.761
Wait, what guy hates getting blowjobs?

01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.597
He had some weird
intimacy problems, okay?

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:52.642
By the end of our relationship, he would
literally shiver when l touched him.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.062
But before that, l always liked it.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.316
l liked it.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.237
Great. That's great.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.449
Perfect. l mean, no pressure.
lt's not like l'm saying,

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:11.787
"Hey, let's go home tonight
and get some BJs." But, you know. . .

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.747
Look, if Sydney hadn't asked me
about our sex life,

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:16.124
we wouldn't even be talking about this.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:17.918
-That's true.
-Yeah.

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.461
You're right.

01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:22.839
-And Hailey was really into him.
-She was?

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:25.133
Yeah, she liked how honest
and direct he was with her.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:28.553
And, yeah, l know, that's the way he is.
That's his thing.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:32.682
-The four of us should go out.
-Yeah. That'd be great.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:33.892
Yeah.

01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:38.438
Sweet.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.775
-Well, have a good Pilates class.
-l will.

01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:44.402
-Be sure to drink lots of water.
-Yeah.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.030
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:51.409
-Hey, Pete, let's go out back, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.959
-She was very nice-looking.
-Yeah, l fucked her.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.295
l wonder if my pineapple
matches your pineapple.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.256
Hey, you want to check?

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.386
Nope. Yours is short and fat
and mine is long and skinny.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.846
Yeah.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.932
Pete, can l talk to you about something?

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.433
-Yeah, what's up?
-Will you put down your treat

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.060
for a minute?

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:24.401
l feel really horrible about that toast
l gave at your engagement dinner.

01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:26.027
lt was ridonculous.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.446
l was really excited to meet Zooey
and your family,

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.741
and then l showed up there
and l was just. . . l got so nervous.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.577
lt wasn't so great.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.372
l want you to know l'm really sorry.
Everybody must hate me.

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:40.000
No, no, no.
Look, you had good intentions.

01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:42.127
-l did.
-l know one person that didn't hate you.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:46.131
Was it Benji's wife?
She's a hot piece of ass.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:49.092
-No, Hailey.
-Yeah. She was funny.

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:51.386
l think she likes you.
We should all go out.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:54.598
She seems great, Pete, but honestly,
within five minutes of meeting her,

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:58.101
she was telling me how she can't wait
to get married and have kids.

01:04:58.185 --> 01:04:59.853
Look, she was kidding around.

01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:02.772
l made reservations to play golf
on Sunday for the four of us.

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:05.150
No, Pete, l told you,
l don't play sports with women.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:08.320
Look, man, you told my fiancée
that she needs to give me blowies

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:11.740
in front of my whole family, all right?
You owe me.

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:15.035
-You make a valid point.
-lt's golf. lt's fun !

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.499
l never have a beer until the ninth hole.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.335
Maybe we can change that rule.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.922
-Okay. All right.
-Keep your head down and fluid.

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:29.799
-Okay. Okay.
-Great, come on. You got it.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:36.681
-Oh, my God !
-Whoa!

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:40.226
-Zooey, that was a great shot.
-Great shot.

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:42.729
Really, really good. l'm really impressed.

01:05:43.564 --> 01:05:46.399
l'm sorry! l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:50.111
-Fuck!
-Sorry. Sorry. l'm sorry, Sydney. Sorry.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:55.033
Motherfucker!
Fucking cock in my fucking shit! God !

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.536
-Mary.
-You okay, man?

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.039
-l'm sorry.
-This is my nightmare!

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:06.294
-Whack it up.
-Whack it, Hails.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:09.464
-Beautiful day.
-Yeah, it is. lt's really nice.

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.716
lt's kind of frustrating.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.927
Yeah. My shin hurts.

01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:16.096
l didn't realize
my skin could bruise that quickly.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.348
-You're good.
-Guys, you're killing us here. Seriously.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:20.725
-Let's get the ladies moving.
-Listen, just give me a second.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:24.479
Rate of play, rate of play, rate of play,
rate of play, rate of play.

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:28.483
Hailey, you know what, why don't we just
pick it up and move down the fairway?

01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:29.901
-No, this is fine.
-Because she won't have a chance

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.653
-to practice, right, Peter?
-l got it.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:34.197
He's kind of got a point. l mean,
we're really holding these guys up.

01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:36.533
You're being an asshole.
Hailey, just take your time, okay?

01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:38.702
He's really not being an asshole.
There's a protocol.

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:40.704
The marshals come by,
and there is some time pressure.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.831
-You know, l'm done. This sucks.
-Hailey, please. . .

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:44.290
-l'm out of here.
-Please don't go.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.583
-Where are you going?
-Come on, Hailey. lt's okay.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.419
-l apologize. l'm sorry.
-l mean, we'll. . . Come on, Hailey.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.586
-Please come back.
-Where are you going?

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.051
-Did you say something?
-No.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:06:59.681
Thank you.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.524
-Hey, man.
-Dude Von Dudenstein,

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:11.943
-what are you doing tonight?
-I just Ieft you haIf an hour ago.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:13.528
l'm watching HBO with Zooey.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:16.698
I know, but I just got an e-maiI aIert
from the Rush fan cIub.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:20.326
The Holy Trinity is playing
a small club gig tonight at the Avalon.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.413
Dude, it's Sunday night.
l can't bail on her again.

01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:24.831
Dude, you have your whole life

01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:27.042
to sit around
and watch premium cable with Zooey.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.044
Whatever, it's our ritual. lt's HBO.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:30.462
lt's not TV, it's HBO.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.964
Have you ever watched Sunday night
programming on HBO? lt's spectacular.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.507
lt's fucking Rush.

01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:39.929
l haven't seen them
since the Signals tour.

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:43.141
Can l invite Zooey?

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:19.511
-Slapping the bass!
-Slapping the bass!

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.301
What the fuck?

01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:03.138
Yeah !

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:24.701
My God. We could practice every day
for six months, and l'm planning on it,

01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:27.996
and we'll still suck. Yeah.
l'll give you a call.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.665
All right. Take it easy, Magooch.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.462
-Were you spying on me?
-Yeah, l was.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:42.010
Because l'm totally weirded out
about what's going on between you two.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.263
What are you talking about?
We were just going over the set list.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.515
-l mean, what's the big deal?
-The big deal is

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.725
that we were supposed to have
a date night,

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.020
and you took me to this concert,
which is cool,

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.229
but then we get there
and it's like l don't even exist.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:59.527
You don't even look at me.
You're licking Sydney's bass guitar.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.405
There were tons of guys
that were licking each other's basses.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:06.117
l just. . .
l feel like l'm losing you a little bit.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:09.621
What? We were just doing
a recap of the set list.

01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:11.581
-What? Zooey.
-Okay.

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:14.209
l was going over the set list.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.754
So the big day's coming up.
How are you feeling?

01:10:17.838 --> 01:10:19.505
Well, you know,
l was feeling really good,

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.675
but Zooey and l have been
fighting a lot recently.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.511
All right, let me ask you a question.
Why are you marrying her?

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.388
What kind of question is that?

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.433
Well, it seems to me like you've gone
from relationship to relationship,

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:34.395
so is Zooey the one
or is she just the next one?

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.022
No, she's the one.

01:10:36.106 --> 01:10:37.732
All right, well, how come?

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:39.067
Because.

01:10:40.277 --> 01:10:42.779
l don't know. We're in love.

01:10:43.697 --> 01:10:45.323
And. . .

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:48.368
That's a hard question to answer.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:53.039
Listen, l'm not trying to push you at all.
lt's just for me,

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:56.376
sometimes talking this stuff out helps
to clarify things. That's all.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.878
Let's go try on some penguin suits.

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.591
Thank you, lovely. What's your name?

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.301
-Raquel.
-That was my mother's name.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:10.848
So l'm thinking about asking Tevin
if he wants in on the Ferrigno house.

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.893
Dude, l pissed on that guy's face
at a Bennigan's.

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.436
You do not need
to be splitting commission

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:18.022
with that frosty-haired chode.

01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:23.361
l have to face facts, Syd.
l'm a flats guy, you know?

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:26.364
Tevin's got the flash needed
to sell the place.

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:28.116
What do you think?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.575
You look fucking stiff.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.995
We're shopping for tuxedos
for your wedding, man.

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:34.289
Let's have a good time.
Loosen it up a little bit.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:37.292
l wanna take a photo.
Now, give me an action pose.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.002
Like what? What do you mean?

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:42.714
Well, you're wearing a tuxedo.
What do you think l mean?

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:47.635
When have you ever seen
anyone in a tuxedo do that move?

01:11:48.053 --> 01:11:49.262
Besides Runaway Bride.

01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:50.471
The ESPYs.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.141
You're wearing a tuxedo.
Think James Bond, all right?

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:55.226
Give me some James Bond.

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:01.649
No.
lt just looks like you're pointing at me.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:08.656
-You look ridiculous, man.
-What am l. . . How can l. . . l can't. . .

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:11.326
-Think Timothy Dalton.
-T-Dalt.

01:12:12.244 --> 01:12:13.870
Hey, that's pretty good.

01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:16.497
Tell you what.
Give me your best Bond impression.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.791
Why don't you get off your board

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:22.420
and get on. . .
"Get out of my dreams and into my car."

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.213
You looking for your pot of gold?

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:26.341
Why does everything l do
sound like a leprechaun?

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:29.344
You tell me. He speaks
like the coolest man on earth.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.180
-The name is Bond. Oh, yeah.
-There you go.

01:12:32.264 --> 01:12:34.599
The name is James Bond.

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:37.560
James Bond.

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:40.855
l'll have a margarita.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:45.777
Well, hey there, Miss Moneypussy.
Wanna jump on my jetpack?

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:49.530
All right, enough of that.
Let's just take the picture, all right?

01:12:49.656 --> 01:12:52.200
Arch an eyebrow for me. Other eyebrow.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.621
No, you just look confused.

01:12:56.955 --> 01:13:00.041
Arch your eyebrow up.
No, not both, just one.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:02.001
l don't know how. . .

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:06.130
All right, maybe l was wrong.
Let's see the back.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:09.842
You know what?
l'm not sure l'm in love with the drape.

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:12.220
What's wrong with the drape?
Does the vent move funny?

01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:14.055
You should wear something
with a little more pizzazz, right?

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:15.556
-A little more flash.
-You don't like the split panel?

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.558
-Peacock it out a bit.
-No.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.727
-Let's try. . .
-What are those? Checkers?

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.354
-Here. Give this one a try.
-Give me a break.

01:13:21.438 --> 01:13:22.438
-No way, man.
-Come on.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:24.732
l can't fricking pull that off. lt's blue.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:25.817
Look at me.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:30.071
You have this image of yourself
as this straight-laced, tight guy,

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:33.408
but l've seen you cut loose
in the man cave, and it is fantastic.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.827
Well, yeah. Slap a little bass.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.995
Yeah, it's the same
with the Ferrigno house.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.499
You have all of the skills in the world,
and you have no confidence.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.543
Now, sack up, man.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:46.212
Put on the fucking suit.

01:13:49.049 --> 01:13:51.342
l can't believe you just touched my balls.

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:57.849
Hey, so listen, l also wanted
to talk to you about something.

01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:01.936
This investment opportunity
has come up. lt's a total winner.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.272
The only problem is
all my funds are tied up in equities,

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:06.524
so l'm cash poor right now.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:12.697
So l was wondering if you would
consider loaning me a few shekels?

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.535
How much are we talking about?

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:20.872
You know, 8.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:27.420
$8,000. That's. . . That's a lot of. . .

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:32.884
That's a lot of quiche, you know?
A lot of cake.

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:35.136
lt just. . . lt might be a little tricky,

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.513
just 'cause Zooey's dad
is out of the picture,

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:40.725
and, you know,
we're paying for the wedding ourselves.

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.059
You know what? Enough said.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.563
An opportunity came up.
l thought l would ask. No big deal.

01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:47.940
Can you tell me about the investment?

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:51.736
l can't, actually.
lt's confidential in nature, so. . .

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:54.447
Okay. Let me think about it.

01:14:54.531 --> 01:14:56.115
Yeah, of course, buddy.

01:14:56.783 --> 01:14:58.284
Hello, Peter.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.827
Doug !

01:15:02.122 --> 01:15:04.165
-This is my. . .
-Sydney.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:06.959
Sydney. This is Sydney.

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:10.546
You know, it takes a lot of nerve

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:12.673
to spend a beautiful evening
with someone

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.092
and then never call them again.

01:15:15.969 --> 01:15:17.178
Doug, l can explain.

01:15:17.262 --> 01:15:19.472
l just wish l could take back that kiss,

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:22.016
because l felt something
that l haven't felt in years,

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.394
and now l know
it was the taste of betrayal.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.104
lt wasn't the taste of betrayal.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.689
-lt was the taste of betrayal.
-No, it really wasn't.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:32.068
lt was the taste of betrayal,
you fucking whore.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.196
-Doug.
-Good day.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.781
Doug, wait.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:40.868
-l can actually explain what just. . .
-l would love to hear that.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:44.997
Wow. l mean, l knew when l got
the nod for the engagement dinner

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.501
you didn't have a ton of friends,
but l had no idea it went that far.

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:52.088
Truth is, l never even thought about it
until Zooey and l got engaged.

01:15:52.172 --> 01:15:54.215
lt's like,
you were basically just using me

01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:56.217
because you needed
to fill out your wedding party.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:58.761
Dude, no. Not it at all.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:02.014
l'd actually given up
on meeting someone,

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:06.394
and then you wandered
into that open house, we hit it off,

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:10.606
and three-quarters of the Rush
songbook later, here we are.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:13.651
-l just wish you'd have told me.
-Well, l was embarrassed.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.737
l mean, you've had a close group
of male friends your whole life. l haven't.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.490
l started feeling
like some kind of weirdo.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:24.620
l get it. But l just want you to know
that you're my friend,

01:16:25.038 --> 01:16:27.290
and you can tell me anything.

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:29.834
Thanks, Sydney. l appreciate that.

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.171
Hey, man, look, about that investment. . .

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.382
Pete, please,
forget l even brought it up, honestly.

01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:37.842
l've been saving my whole life,

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.760
and you were right.
l'm gonna sell the Ferrigno place.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.846
Fuck, yeah, you are.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.141
l'd be happy to lend you the money.
l know you're good for it.

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:48.561
Pistol, that is great. Thank you.

01:16:49.187 --> 01:16:52.773
lt's the least l could do
for the best man at my wedding.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:57.194
What are you talking about?

01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:00.615
l want you to stand up there with me.
Are you cool with that?

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:01.949
Am l cool with that?

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:05.661
Of course l'll be your best man !
That's an honor! lt's. . .

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:12.043
You're a whore, Peter.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.923
-l think we're almost there.
-l think we're almost there, too.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.676
l think it's just about putting
the random people together.

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:22.803
-Yeah.
-We should talk about the main table,

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:26.515
because if Hailey doesn't find a date
before the wedding,

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.810
which, let's be honest,
it seems pretty likely that she won't. . .

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.312
l know.

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.147
. . .we have an extra seat at our table.

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:36.692
Well, l was thinking that maybe
Sydney would sit at our table.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:39.070
l asked him to be my best man.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:42.990
Great! That's awesome.
That was the whole thing.

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.868
l'm not an idiot.
You're not psyched about this at all.

01:17:45.952 --> 01:17:49.622
No, it's just. . .
l feel like he has some issue with me.

01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:52.375
What? No. You guys just haven't
spent any time together.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:54.835
-We've spent some time together.
-l'll talk to him.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.170
Peter, do not talk to him.

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:58.172
He's gonna think
l'm saying stuff behind his back.

01:17:58.256 --> 01:18:02.468
-You are saying stuff behind his back.
-No. l'm just sharing a feeling with you.

01:18:02.552 --> 01:18:03.886
And l want you to.

01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:05.888
But, Peter,
please don't say anything to him.

01:18:05.972 --> 01:18:07.598
Okay, l won't.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.143
So, we still have
to pick up the marriage license.

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:14.230
-Can you meet up tomorrow afternoon?
-Totally, yeah. Perfect.

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:17.024
So, what'd she say
about me being your best man?

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.944
She was pumped.
She thought it was awesome.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:21.529
Come on, dude.

01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:25.282
l'm the worst liar.
l promised her l wouldn't say anything.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.618
Well, what is it?

01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:30.287
She thinks you don't like her.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:33.916
What? That is. . . No, of course l like her.
Are you. . .

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.334
We've only hung out a few times,

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:38.546
but she's gonna be your wife.
Of course l like her.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:41.632
This dumb toast
is gonna haunt me forever.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.136
Oh, man !

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:49.890
Dude, why is Ferrigno eating
with that urinal-cake-faced fuckhead?

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:52.017
We gotta confront him. Hold this.

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:54.228
No, wait. Sydney, wait, wait.
Wait. Sydney!

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:59.817
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck is going on here?

01:19:00.193 --> 01:19:02.361
-Do l know you?
-No, you don't know me,

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.572
but l believe you know
my friend Peter Klaven,

01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.866
who has an exclusive listing
on this man's property.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:09.076
Lou, you promised Peter
the commission to your house.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.703
l know, but he's not doing shit with it.

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.538
That is total crap, Hulk, all right?

01:19:12.622 --> 01:19:14.832
Listen, this kind of stuff
doesn't happen overnight.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.041
Peter, who the hell is this guy?

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.002
Hulk, let me tell you something
about Peter. . .

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:21.255
Look, please get your hand out of
my face and stop calling me Hulk.

01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:22.423
l'm a person, okay?

01:19:22.507 --> 01:19:23.883
l'm a person, okay.

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:25.092
-l warned you.
-You warned me?

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:26.218
-Hello?
-Hey.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:27.595
l'm on my way to the marriage bureau.

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:29.180
Fuck you, Lou Ferrigno!

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:30.306
ls that Sydney?

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:32.224
-Hey!
-Fuck you, Hulk!

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:34.518
Oh, shit.

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:36.520
What the. . . What are you doing?

01:19:36.646 --> 01:19:38.939
-What's going on?
-Sydney. He's fighting Lou Ferrigno.

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:41.150
Peter! He's so strong!

01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:43.611
-Easy. Don't fight it.
-The Hulk has me in a sleeper hold,

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:46.947
-and l don't think l can take him. . .
-Easy. That's it.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.240
Peter!

01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:50.201
-Wow.
-Peter!

01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:53.078
Why the fuck would anyone
get in a fight with Lou Ferrigno?

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:55.623
Sydney's a hothead.
He thought he was standing up for me.

01:19:55.707 --> 01:19:57.249
To The lncredible Hulk?

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:02.046
No, that's just a character he played.
ln real life, Lou's actually a sweet man.

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:05.841
So, what does that mean
for your development property?

01:20:06.426 --> 01:20:08.219
lt means it's over.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:10.000
Without the Ferrigno commission,
l'm not gonna be able to afford it.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.096
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Without the Ferrigno commission,
l'm not gonna be able to afford it.

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:12.306
You have some money saved up.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:15.976
Can't you just write them a check,
you know, to show your good faith?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:15.976 --> 01:20:16.061
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:20.439
Between the wedding, and then,
you know, l lent Sydney some money.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.439 --> 01:20:20.524
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.000
l mean, it's just l'm gonna be short.
That's it.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.067
l mean, it's just l'm gonna be short.
That's it.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.987
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You lent Sydney money?

01:20:27.447 --> 01:20:29.657
For an investment.
All his money's tied up in equities.

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:32.493
-He's gonna pay me back.
-Peter, that's not the point.

01:20:32.577 --> 01:20:36.205
We're getting married. You can't
just keep stuff like this from me.

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:38.332
Can l ask you a question?

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:42.169
Why do you think we're getting married?

01:20:43.713 --> 01:20:45.172
What are you talking about?

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.299
No, it's just. . . Sydney asked me
that question, and l couldn't. . .

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.678
"Well, why Zooey?"
And l didn't know how to answer it.

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:54.390
-Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?
-Yes.

01:20:54.474 --> 01:20:56.350
Two weeks before our wedding

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:59.061
and you don't know
why you're marrying me?

01:20:59.145 --> 01:21:02.147
Just forget it. lt was a stupid question.
l don't even know what l was thinking.

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:05.860
Just forget. . . Take it back 1 0 seconds
before l asked it,

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.361
and let's live in that time.

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:11.031
The thing is, Peter,
l get why you would wonder that. l do.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:15.327
But l wish you would have answered
the question before you proposed to me.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:18.038
That's the thing.
Before l didn't even think about it.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:20.124
That came out bad, too.
l didn't. . . l'm so. . .

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.709
l'm confused.
l don't know what l'm saying.

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:23.586
Let me just make this
a little simpler for you.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.796
l'm gonna go stay
with Denise and Barry,

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:29.675
and you and your bud Sydney
can hang out and beat up Lou Ferrigno

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:31.051
and go to Rush concerts

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:34.680
and ride a tandem bicycle down
the Venice Boardwalk for all l care.

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:37.391
-We never rode bicycles.
-Goodbye!

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:41.395
Zooey, come on ! This is ridiculous!
Zooey! Zooey!

01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:14.929
Oh, my God.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:25.522
My God.

01:22:26.858 --> 01:22:30.736
All right, he put up some billboards.
Put up some billboards.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:33.113
Oh, my God.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.244
Oh, God ! No!

01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:44.667
Fuck me over. Fucking fucking fuck!

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:48.087
Are you kidding me?

01:22:50.173 --> 01:22:51.423
Come on !

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:00.641
Yeah, it's open.

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:02.184
Hey.

01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:04.645
That's what you borrowed $8,000 for?

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:06.605
You saw the billboards.
Pretty awesome, right?

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:07.648
Pretty awesome?

01:23:07.732 --> 01:23:10.150
My buddy Dave sells ad space,
so he got us a great deal.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.860
Pretty awesome? They're idiotic.

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:15.280
You put my face on a 1 0-foot dick
over Santa Monica Boulevard.

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:17.116
Yeah. lt's hilarious.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.036
Well, in one day you managed to screw
my career, you ruined my relationship. . .

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:23.205
What are you talking about?
Ruin your relationship?

01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:24.331
Zooey walked out on me

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:27.292
because l asked her
why we were getting married.

01:23:28.878 --> 01:23:30.212
Why would you ask her that?

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:33.340
Pete, that conversation
was between you and me.

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:37.011
You can't have that talk with her. l just. . .
Look, l assumed you understood that.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.055
God, l am so sick
of your ridiculous rules.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.725
l like it that l can share things
with Zooey.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:46.603
l like it that if l can't sleep at night,
she's there to talk to.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.732
Do you know the best night
l've had in the last five years

01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:51.984
is the night
that Zooey and l split a bottle of wine,

01:23:52.068 --> 01:23:54.987
we made a summer salad,
and watched Chocolat together.

01:23:55.071 --> 01:23:56.822
-You mean Chocolate?
-ChocoIat.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:58.866
-Chocolate with Johnny Depp.
-ChocoIat.

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.951
You're not fucking French, Pete.
lt's called Chocolate.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.036
Chocolate has got an "E" on it.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.495
-That was your favorite night?
-Yes.

01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:06.331
Your best night in five years is
watching Chocolate with Johnny Depp?

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:07.416
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.878
The combination of wine
and summer salad and Chocolat, yeah.

01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:12.004
You should be embarrassed.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:14.048
You know, l think you're threatened
by what Zooey and l have

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.175
because you're afraid
l won't be able to hang out every night.

01:24:16.259 --> 01:24:18.719
Hey, you know what?
l have a ton of friends, all right?

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:20.888
Yeah, who are all moving on
with their lives.

01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:24.725
They're in relationships. They have kids.
They're growing up.

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:26.935
Hey, let's not forget.
You were the one using me.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.772
-l think we were using each other.
-Whatever.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.734
l really don't understand
what's going on right now.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.238
l think we should spend
some time apart.

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:43.952
Okay.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.082
So if l actually do
wind up having a wedding,

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:51.668
it's probably best that you not be there.

01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:55.130
Yeah. Sounds good to me, Pete.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.882
And if you could have
those billboards taken down. . .

01:24:56.966 --> 01:25:00.719
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it'll take
a few days, but l will get on that.

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:04.848
And l'll also make sure you get
your money back as soon as possible.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:08.727
Also, l think you have
my season 2 Lost DVDs. lf you. . .

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:14.525
-lf you haven't watched them yet. . .
-lt's fine, Pete. They're right here.

01:25:17.028 --> 01:25:18.529
-Thanks.
-Yep.

01:25:19.697 --> 01:25:21.740
lt's just Zooey hasn't seen them all yet,

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:24.910
and she's really curious as to what
was going on inside that hatch.

01:25:24.994 --> 01:25:26.120
Yep.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:32.376
-l wish you the best of luck, Peter.
-You, too, Sydney.

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:36.505
Bye, Anwar.

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:52.563
-Hey, Denise. Sorry to bother you.
-lt's. . . l'll go get Zooey.

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:54.731
-Thank you.
-lt's okay.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.863
-Hey, Barry.
-Poker night.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:03.824
-Full table.
-That's okay.

01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:06.326
l'm here to talk to my fiancée.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.411
Nice face.

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:10.038
Thank you.

01:26:10.456 --> 01:26:13.250
-On the billboards.
-Right. Yeah.

01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:17.421
-Yeah, my friend Sydney, he. . .
-l don't give a shit.

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:22.259
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:26:23.386 --> 01:26:26.221
-Could l talk to you outside?
-Yeah.

01:26:28.933 --> 01:26:31.518
-License to sell.
-Yeah.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:34.021
Look, that's what Sydney borrowed
all that money for.

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:35.814
He thought it would help my career.

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:38.150
Well, it got your name out there.

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:41.445
Besides, you look pretty cute
with a thick mustache.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:46.366
Zooey, look,
l'm so sorry that l asked you

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:47.826
why you thought we should get married.

01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:49.828
lt's just that l've been talking
about this stuff with Sydney,

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.914
and, you know, it made me nervous.

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:55.459
Peter, l'm nervous, too, okay?
lt's a big deal.

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:58.587
l couldn't believe actually how sure
you seemed about the whole thing,

01:26:58.671 --> 01:27:02.549
which is why l freaked out when you
all of a sudden started questioning it.

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:05.219
Well, l'm sure about us
for so many reasons.

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:08.305
Truth is, l've been a girlfriend guy,
but out of all those girls,

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:10.641
you're the only one
that wanted me to have my own life.

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:14.645
You know? You want me
to have friends for me, not you.

01:27:15.271 --> 01:27:18.607
lt's, like, one of the most romantic
things l could ever think of.

01:27:18.691 --> 01:27:20.234
What's up?

01:27:21.861 --> 01:27:23.695
Dude, come on.

01:27:23.988 --> 01:27:27.991
Zooey, l love you, and l wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.911
Can we get this engagement
back on track?

01:27:30.995 --> 01:27:31.995
Okay.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.498
-Please?
-Yes. Yes.

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:38.252
-Come on, it's poker night.
-So?

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:39.795
So just take her out for a cup of coffee
or something.

01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:41.088
l'm not taking her out for a cup of coffee.

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:43.423
Why don't you take the boys
to fucking Starbucks and play poker?

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.759
Because it's poker night here.
lt's always poker night here.

01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:46.885
Yeah, that's my best friend.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.637
l'm not leaving her, ever.
How about that?

01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:51.139
She can stay here for five years
if she wants to.

01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:53.392
You're gonna dress up like
a cheerleader tonight for me, all right?

01:27:53.476 --> 01:27:54.893
Fine. Get the fuck out of here.

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:58.730
Hey, Zooey, you can stay here as long
as you want. You are always welcome.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:01.233
-Thank you.
-Okay? Hey, by the way,

01:28:01.317 --> 01:28:04.278
Peter, they've got plenty of room open
on the poker table.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.405
They were lying.
They'd love to have you play poker.

01:28:06.489 --> 01:28:08.365
-l'm not going to.
-Okay.

01:28:09.575 --> 01:28:11.618
Oh, my God.
Barry and Denise fight all the time,

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.578
and then they have really loud,
intense make-up sex.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:14.663
Please get me out of here, please.

01:28:14.747 --> 01:28:16.331
-Let's get your stuff. Come on.
-Okay.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.417
By the way, l ended things with Sydney.

01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:20.752
Peter, really?
l hope that's not because of me.

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:25.215
No, no. He can be a great guy. lt's just. . .
lt wasn't really working out.

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.221
Then you process your purchase.

01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:33.557
That sounds riveting.

01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:41.231
l just stepped
in your dog's crap, asshole!

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:45.068
Aren't you gonna pick up
your dog's shit, shit giant?

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.362
Pick up your shit like a man !

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:49.281
Nice scarf, dickwad !

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:53.493
-Okay, so what should be our last song?
-Into the Mystic.

01:28:54.203 --> 01:28:56.038
That's perfect. That is perfect.

01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:59.333
Okay. Okay, so we have to go
through the place cards one more time,

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.418
'cause l'm a little bit. . .

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.172
Why don't you just call him?

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:09.092
Because guys don't do that.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:15.932
E, Ethan. What's up, my man?
E. Bone Capone.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:17.768
l'm just hanging out, man.

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:20.270
l wanted to see if you wanted to come
over and watch TV or something.

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:23.106
Again you're gonna watch
the Wonder Emporium?

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.194
Dude, what the fuck is there
to do at LEGOLAND

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:29.196
that you take these kids there
every weekend?

01:29:31.115 --> 01:29:34.409
l understand that
that's not the point of teaching,

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:35.994
but just give them all B pluses.

01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:38.955
Can l. . . Could l come with you?

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:43.460
What do you mean,
the kids think l'm creepy?

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.172
-Good to see you, Peter.
-You, too, Mel.

01:29:47.256 --> 01:29:51.635
You know, l haven't had a real friend
since my wife passed.

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.388
l'm really glad you called.

01:29:56.015 --> 01:29:59.226
Hey, do you have any plans
on June 30th?

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:04.564
l'm 89 years old. What the fuck
kind of plans would l have?

01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:11.405
Just needed an adjustment.
I hope it'II be better now.

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:16.159
My mother knew Roux's return
had nothing to do with the siIIy oId door.

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:20.872
So did I.

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:22.791
Stupid.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:24.376
My favorite, hot chocoIate.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.294
Davis Dunn, how may l direct your call?

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:28.422
-Hey, Leanne.
-Peter. Where have you been?

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:30.757
Well, it's my wedding this weekend,

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:34.302
so l've been helping my fiancée
with all the last-minute preparations.

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:35.971
They broke the mold
when they made you.

01:30:36.055 --> 01:30:37.055
Yeah.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.307
Go check your voice mail.
You got like a million messages.

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:46.189
Yeah, is this PistoI Pete?

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:48.400
I have a home in Los FeIiz,
and I've been trying to seII it,

01:30:48.484 --> 01:30:51.570
and I saw your biIIboards.
I'm very impressed with your ads.

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:54.739
License to seII? That's hystericaI!
It's Iike James Bond.

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:56.950
Hi, I'm interested
in buying the Ferrigno estate.

01:30:57.034 --> 01:30:58.410
-If you couId give me a caII.
-Oh, my God.

01:30:58.494 --> 01:31:02.080
I Iove the one with you in the bed.
My number is 31 0...

01:31:02.498 --> 01:31:04.249
-My husband and I saw your ad...
-Stop. Slow down.

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:06.918
HeIIo, Peter. It's Doug.

01:31:07.378 --> 01:31:10.213
Saw the biIIboards. They are wonderfuI.

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:15.010
WouIdn't expect anything Iess from you.
And sorry about caIIing you a whore.

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.804
And heIIo to Sydney
if you guys are stiII together.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:19.890
Otherwise, you can Facebook me.

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:23.602
Peter, hi. It's Lou Ferrigno.
WonderfuI biIIboards.

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.854
Listen, I'm sorry
if I ever doubted you, man.

01:31:26.063 --> 01:31:27.814
l told that douchebag Tevin

01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.150
that l want you to have
the exclusive back on my house.

01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:31.359
-Excuse me, Mr. Ferrigno?
-Yeah.

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:33.403
-Ten-minute warning.
-Okay. Thank you.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.822
So just call me or just text me.

01:31:36.073 --> 01:31:37.866
Goodbye, my friend.

01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:45.332
There's my dog !

01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:48.043
Hey, me rikey the billboards.

01:31:48.127 --> 01:31:50.587
l completely underestimated you,
my brother.

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:53.256
What say we go down to Houston's,
get a burger and a beer

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.760
and talk about how we can tag-team
the Ferrigno deal?

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:04.851
Why are you slapping me?

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:07.103
Because l wanted
to cause you some physical pain,

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:10.524
but l have never actually hit anybody
in the face. lt freaks me out.

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:13.068
And l didn't really know what to do.

01:32:13.152 --> 01:32:16.112
Tevin, stay the fuck away
from my listing.

01:32:23.996 --> 01:32:26.081
-Hey, Carolyn.
-Hey, Pete.

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:29.376
Good luck, Peter.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.557
l'm so excited to see who Peter chose
for his wedding party.

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.141
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.413
Honestly, that has to be
the most random

01:33:06.497 --> 01:33:08.873
collection of groomsmen
in the history of weddings.

01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:11.209
-l'm great. You know, l just got to. . .
-Okay.

01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:12.586
l'll see you at the wedding.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.671
l'm gonna get another mimosa.

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:17.132
Do you want to finish the one. . .

01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:39.738
Hello?

01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:43.575
Hey. Wow,
l didn't expect to hear from you.

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:47.495
No, l wouldn't want to impose.

01:33:49.081 --> 01:33:50.957

You invited him?

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:12.557
Well, l saw you walking
on the lawn looking all sad,

01:36:12.641 --> 01:36:16.853
and l realized l couldn't let you
get married without your best man.

01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:23.026
-l love you so much.
-l love you, too.

01:36:23.235 --> 01:36:25.236

Yeah. You know what,
l was on the Vesp,

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:33.369
so l just did the old weaveroo.

01:36:33.996 --> 01:36:36.915
Dude, you're lying.
Your voice went up when you said that.

01:36:36.999 --> 01:36:38.833
His voice got high.

01:36:40.377 --> 01:36:42.128
Look, l was on my way
when Zooey called.

01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:45.882
lnvite or not, there was no way
l was gonna miss your wedding,

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:48.301
and l wanted to give you this.

01:36:51.388 --> 01:36:53.139
Man, you don't have to do this.

01:36:53.224 --> 01:36:54.349
You know what?
l know you don't believe me,

01:36:54.433 --> 01:36:57.101
but l'm actually
a pretty successful investor, so. . .

01:36:57.186 --> 01:36:59.395
Look, the billboards
were my wedding gift to you guys.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.605
Man, they worked.

01:37:00.689 --> 01:37:03.483

that they must have worked.

01:37:03.567 --> 01:37:05.318
-That's great.
-Lou's the best.

01:37:05.402 --> 01:37:06.903

l put him in a sleeper hold. Out.

01:37:13.577 --> 01:37:15.578
