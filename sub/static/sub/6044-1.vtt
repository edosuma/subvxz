00:47.340 --> 00:49.717
Excuse me, sir, is this
the right train to Newhaven?

00:49.759 --> 00:51.928
Yeah. Next train
on this platform, sir.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.638
Thanks.
All right.

01:23.293 --> 01:26.087
Malcolm, Malcolm.
Evening, guv.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.591
Uh, right, 11:30, Newhaven.
Done and done.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.259
Thank you very much.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.027
Bad news?

02:31.110 --> 02:32.445
No.

02:38.660 --> 02:42.997
Right. Congratulations.
Ken called in sick.

02:43.081 --> 02:44.874
Looks like you're
on the Eastborough redeye.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.669
Tonight?
Mmhmm.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.837
Hang on,
I've just done my shift.

02:49.879 --> 02:53.675
They must all be lawabiding
citizens on your trains.

02:53.716 --> 02:56.761
You haven't issued
a penalty fare in six weeks.

02:58.513 --> 03:00.932
Or are you
just not man enough?

03:12.235 --> 03:14.362
I'll do it.
Good boy.

03:14.404 --> 03:16.030
Platform nine.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.867
You alright, love?
Fine.

03:35.758 --> 03:38.219
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.971
This is your guard speaking.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.973
I would like
to welcome you aboard

03:42.056 --> 03:45.226
the 23:59 Alpha Trax
service to Eastborough,

03:45.309 --> 03:49.814
calling at Morsley Junction,
Woolscot, Edgcombe,

03:49.897 --> 03:55.445
Abington Cross, Wychford,
Christchurch, Barrock's Hill,

03:55.528 --> 03:59.073
Old Milton, and arriving
at Eastborough at 1:48.

03:59.157 --> 04:00.742
I'd like to remind you
at this time

04:00.825 --> 04:03.077
to have your tickets
ready for inspection.

04:03.161 --> 04:04.704
Thank you.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.957
Tickets, please.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.294
Ta. Lovely.
Thank you, madam.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.380
Tickets and passes, please.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.593
Tickets, please.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.386
Good, thank you, sir.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.890
Excuse me, madam, tickets.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.391
<i>I'll</i> get that for you.

04:36.569 --> 04:38.988
Obviously not a fan of trains.

04:42.492 --> 04:44.660
Nasty man.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.080
Tickets, please.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.876
Thank you, madam.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.298
Ticket, please.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.550
What? Oh, Christ. Um...

05:00.510 --> 05:02.011
Hang on.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.138
No rush, you're alright.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.019
That's weird.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.816
I had it this morning.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.652
Today has just been
a complete nightmare.
Let's see...

05:17.693 --> 05:18.903
If you don't have a valid pass

05:18.986 --> 05:20.530
I have to charge the full fare.

05:22.323 --> 05:27.161
What? Seriously?
I take this train every single day.

05:27.245 --> 05:29.121
Those are the rules.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.459
Where is it
you're traveling to?

05:34.752 --> 05:36.337
Eastborough.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.756
Eastborough...

05:38.840 --> 05:41.467
That's gonna be £39 then, please.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.810
Thank you.
Ta.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.230
Apologies. Just wait
for your change.

05:54.814 --> 05:56.065
Sorry.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.692
That's lovely, thank you.

05:57.775 --> 06:00.027
Tickets, please!
Can I see your tickets, please?

06:02.280 --> 06:04.323
Thank you, sir.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.246
Why don't you get a proper job?

06:19.088 --> 06:22.300
It was so great.
The guys, they were so hot.

06:22.383 --> 06:25.553
I'll go tomorrow.
About 12ish, is that alright?

06:25.636 --> 06:27.889
We'll go home, get changed,
and I can wear shorts.

06:27.972 --> 06:30.975
It was brilliant.
I wish you were there.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.977
Tickets and passes, please.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.897
I ran so hard I wet myself.
Yeah... It's really boring.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.398
But the party was amazing.
You'd have loved it.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.649
It was what you
thought it was gonna be.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.443
Can I see your ticket, please?

06:40.526 --> 06:42.403
It was a great night.
You should've been there.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.405
I know! Well, yeah.
It was so brilliant.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.782
Tickets, please?
Yeah, that'll be really cool.

06:46.866 --> 06:48.993
I like that. Yeah. Anyway...
Can you get off your phone?

06:49.076 --> 06:52.079
You're in a quiet zone.
Yeah. That'll be really cool.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.999
Anyway, he's such a boring...
Miss?

07:00.713 --> 07:03.507
I know, right?
Thank you.

07:05.009 --> 07:07.219
Oh, my God, this guy
is totally staring at my tits.

07:11.766 --> 07:14.101
Such a perv.

07:14.143 --> 07:17.939
What can I say?
It's not my fault.
It was so funny.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.776
Thank you. Ta.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.451
Tickets, please.

07:31.744 --> 07:33.955
Thank you, sir.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.833
Can I see
your ticket, please?

07:43.923 --> 07:45.049
Thank you.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.562
Tickets, please. Thank you.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.315
Any coffee?
See your tickets, please.

08:01.399 --> 08:03.150
For you, sir?

08:04.694 --> 08:06.654
Chicken?

08:06.696 --> 08:08.614
Thanks.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.826
Hiya.
Alright?

08:11.909 --> 08:14.537
£1.85, please.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.247
Didn't realize
you were on tonight.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.999
Yeah, double shift.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.042
Trying to save as much
as I can this month.

08:20.126 --> 08:22.920
Oh, right. Yeah.
Dave's done the same to me.

08:24.672 --> 08:28.259
You still trying to go?
I haven't decided yet.

08:28.342 --> 08:31.762
I don't wanna be serving chicken
sandwiches the rest of my life.

08:31.846 --> 08:33.389
No.
Yes?

08:33.472 --> 08:35.558
Coffee, white,
two sugars, please.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.183
And why would you?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.522
Sorry about your promotion.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.526
David told me.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.447
I think
he told everyone.
Oh.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.033
That doesn't surprise me.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.617
Ah, it's not the end
of the world.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.911
Something else better
will come up, I'm sure.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.955
Well, you should try again.

08:58.039 --> 09:00.207
You know, you're good
with the passengers.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.251
People like you.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.426
Ellen...

09:10.509 --> 09:12.011
Do you want to go
for a drink later on?

09:13.387 --> 09:17.099
Um... Um...

09:17.183 --> 09:19.727
Well, I don't think
anywhere will be open.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.064
Yeah, no, probably not.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.900
Um, I'm on again
in the morning, so...

09:28.527 --> 09:31.072
Yeah.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.574
I better get on,
but good luck next time.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.160
Oh, it was just
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.661
Don't worry about it.

09:37.745 --> 09:41.957
I meant with
the supervisor application.

09:44.502 --> 09:46.295
Right.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.426
Need a piss.

09:52.510 --> 09:55.346
Well done.
That went well, mate.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.244
<i>PM
This is the driver.
Sorry for the bump.</i>

12:23.327 --> 12:25.746
<i>Seems we hit
something on the line.</i>

12:25.788 --> 12:28.916
<i>Please remain seated.
We should be on our way shortly.</i>

12:28.958 --> 12:30.292
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:31.794 --> 12:36.507
You alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.426
That was quite a ride, mate.
Sorry about that, sir.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.136
Yeah.
You alright, Ellen?

12:41.220 --> 12:42.930
Look at this mess.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.766
Don't worry about the mess.
We'll sort that out.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.478
No, I'll do that.
No, no, no. <i>I'll</i> do that.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.692
Allow me.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.076
Thanks!
Any time.

13:08.664 --> 13:11.000
Are these yours?
Cheers, yeah.

13:16.422 --> 13:18.882
Mine, too. Thank you.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.433
Maybe you should
check on the others?

13:29.018 --> 13:31.895
Right, yeah. OK.
You're both sound, fine?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.189
Yeah, I think we
got it covered.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.251
Is everybody alright down here?
Madam, you alright?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.003
Yes, yes, but what happened?

14:38.087 --> 14:40.130
Have we crashed?
Did we come off the tracks?

14:40.214 --> 14:41.715
We're trying to get
to the bottom of it.

14:41.799 --> 14:44.093
You should have seat belts
if you wanna stop like that.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.969
I hear you.
Sir, let me help you with these.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.389
- Ged, please!
- Did we come off the track?

14:48.472 --> 14:50.391
Let me take these.
I'll do it!

14:50.432 --> 14:53.727
We're alright.
It's her you wanna worry about.

14:53.811 --> 14:57.398
Ged!
Just take a seat for me.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.566
Calm down.
Miss, you alright?

14:59.608 --> 15:01.402
I've gotta call my mum.
I could have died.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.946
Are you OK, though?
If this is broken, I will sue.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.240
I understand your concern,
but you need to calm down.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.449
Don't touch me, pervert!

15:51.368 --> 15:54.246
Are you alright?
What do you think?

16:00.085 --> 16:03.213
You alright, mate?
Yeah. We going soon,
or what?

16:03.297 --> 16:05.883
Yeah, yeah. I'm just waiting
to hear from the driver.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.885
Just take it easy for a minute.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.219
You alright down there, sir?

16:10.596 --> 16:13.015
I dropped my book.
Dropped your book...

16:13.098 --> 16:15.017
Right, hang on.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.814
Sir, here's your book.
Here you go, sir.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.860
Oh, thanks. I've lost my page now.
I'd just got to a good bit.

16:24.943 --> 16:28.530
I think you'll be alright, mate.
Just stay there and keep calm.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.164
Driver, this is the guard.

16:37.206 --> 16:39.124
Hello?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.548
Hello?

17:04.775 --> 17:07.694
Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies once again for the delay.

17:07.736 --> 17:10.864
I'm still waiting on word
from the driver.

17:10.948 --> 17:13.242
Thanks for your patience.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.737
Dear, oh, dear.

17:50.821 --> 17:53.740
Come on, sausage. Come here.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.251
Oh, found my page!

20:03.620 --> 20:05.080
This is a no smoking train, miss.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.541
Piss off.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.215
You want me to get out and push?

20:18.593 --> 20:20.804
I don't believe this.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.399
What's happening?
I tried knocking.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.860
He's not answering
the intercom either.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.455
Tony?

20:48.832 --> 20:50.417
Tony?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.544
Tony?

21:04.598 --> 21:07.476
Maybe you should keep
an eye on the passengers.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.604
Well, they wanna know
what's going on.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.690
Perhaps give them some food
or something, keep them sweet.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.027
Not much left.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.945
Better than nothing.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.877
No sign?

22:33.353 --> 22:36.898
Hello. Hello. Um...
We seem to have broken down

22:36.982 --> 22:39.359
just outside Eastborough.
I think...

22:39.401 --> 22:41.736
I think it must be
Thornton Forest.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.947
And we can't seem
to locate our driver.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.701
Just looking for some advice
on how to proceed, over.

22:47.742 --> 22:50.620
<i>Tell me about it'.
We've got' chaos out there tonight.</i>

22:50.704 --> 22:54.457
<i>We've got' trees
down... signal failures...</i>

22:54.541 --> 22:58.712
<i>ETA for replacement...</i>

22:58.795 --> 23:02.048
Sorry, go again on the ETA?
Four hours?

23:02.132 --> 23:04.050
The storm has brought down
a lot of trees.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.553
You want me to stay
on this skanky train?
Fuck right off.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.598
What does the driver say?
Does he think he can fix it?

23:09.681 --> 23:12.142
The driver...

23:12.225 --> 23:14.185
He's working on it.

23:14.269 --> 23:17.397
Right, so he might be able
to get us going again?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.774
No... I don't know... Maybe?

23:19.858 --> 23:22.402
Is the train
broken down or not?

23:22.444 --> 23:24.321
What did he actually say?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.615
I haven't been able to speak to him.
I can't get through.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.617
Right. Forget it,
<i>I'll</i> ask him myself.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.077
You can't do that.
Well, watch me do that.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.788
No, we don't know
where he is.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.374
Sorry?

23:36.458 --> 23:39.252
Are you telling us
the driver is missing?

23:39.294 --> 23:40.378
Oh, my God.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.591
He didn't come back.
Where's he gone?

23:44.674 --> 23:46.676
I don't know.
I'm trying to work on it.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.595
I didn't want to worry you
so I didn't say anything.

23:48.637 --> 23:51.640
Well, that didn't really work,
did it?

23:51.723 --> 23:55.602
I don't suppose you know
how to drive it?
The train, I mean.

23:55.644 --> 23:56.978
I'm afraid not.

23:57.062 --> 23:59.105
You need to get
your supervisor on the radio.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.191
My husband
has high blood pressure.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.276
He can't wait here all night.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.030
I want my money back.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.490
Please just calm down.

24:11.409 --> 24:14.329
Alright!

24:14.412 --> 24:16.164
Thank you.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.460
Now, the way I see it,
we've got two options.

24:20.543 --> 24:24.047
Either we all sit here
and compose our complaint letters,

24:24.130 --> 24:26.758
or we actually do
something about it.

24:26.841 --> 24:29.386
Like what?
Like use those wiggly things

24:29.469 --> 24:32.555
on the end of your legs
and walk on out of here.

24:34.391 --> 24:37.018
The station can't be more
than, what, a two-mile walk?

24:37.102 --> 24:41.147
Three, max. We might even get
a phone signal before then.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.024
I'm in.

24:43.108 --> 24:46.361
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!
You can't just...

24:46.444 --> 24:49.406
Safety protocol clearly states
passengers must stay

24:49.489 --> 24:51.658
on the train and await assistance.
Those are the rules.

24:51.741 --> 24:55.161
Ridiculous.
It's not.
I will lose my job.

24:55.203 --> 24:58.081
Sir! You can't get out of there
without any keys.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.918
And do you have
some keys?
Yes.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.503
Would you kindly use them?
No.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.880
Come on!
No, sir.
I will lose my job.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.590
I can't open the door.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.010
We can follow the tracks,
all stay together.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.846
I don't see there'll be
a problem.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.765
Yeah, come on.
It's stopped raining now.

25:15.849 --> 25:19.019
- Please.
- Come on.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.187
Well?

25:21.229 --> 25:23.690
I can't leave the train
with these pensioners.

25:26.401 --> 25:29.029
You just make sure
you keep up, son.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.573
Come on!

25:31.656 --> 25:34.617
Wouldn't you rather spend
the night in your own bed?

25:34.701 --> 25:37.370
Huh?

25:37.454 --> 25:40.373
Get your keys out.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.126
Please.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.091
I'm gonna lose my job
for doing this.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.231
Come on.
Come on, then.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.192
- OK?
- Yes, fine, come on.

26:07.275 --> 26:10.612
Just keep straight
down there. Down there.

26:10.695 --> 26:14.240
Keep this side of the...
Wait up there, please.

26:14.282 --> 26:17.285
- Want a hand?
- I'll hold your arm.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.829
Queue up there,
please, madam.

26:19.913 --> 26:22.499
No, I'm first.
OK, I'll go first.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.585
- Bit of a drop, isn't it?
- You'll be alright.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.337
Perhaps you won't.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.844
- OK...
- Careful.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.139
Alright?

26:38.223 --> 26:40.934
There's a rail here you've
just got to get your foot on.

26:41.017 --> 26:43.603
Right... Ooh, OK.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.522
Thank you very much.

26:45.605 --> 26:48.274
Last but not least.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.443
Whee!

26:50.527 --> 26:52.112
Thanks.
It's my pleasure.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.947
Five, six, seven...

26:53.988 --> 26:56.825
Right, stick together, please.
Mind your step out here.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.077
I'll light the path.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.995
<i>I'll</i> light the track.

27:01.079 --> 27:05.208
That's the long metal thing
that the train goes on, is it, boss?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.669
Stick together, please.

27:07.752 --> 27:11.172
I'm Nina.
Billy.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.174
Hey!
Fuel leak.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.717
Oh.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.637
Ooh!
Why don't you walk with me?

27:17.720 --> 27:21.307
We don't want you
falling over in the dark.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.480
Stick together, please!

27:27.522 --> 27:31.109
Recognize where we are?
Could be Thornton Forest.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.203
You all right
there at the back, sir?

27:53.464 --> 27:55.717
Can you hurry up at the front?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.927
I want to get there tonight.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.684
Not exactly
a favorite pastime of mine,

28:04.726 --> 28:06.644
trekking through the woods.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.412
Don't worry, it's just
a deer or something.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.247
Keep going.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.760
Come on, guys,
it's getting closer now.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.345
Do you think
it could be the driver?

28:40.428 --> 28:41.804
Why would he be
in the bushes?

28:41.888 --> 28:42.972
I don't know.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.474
It just sounds like it could be.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.230
Just wait here.
Can we not just keep on going?

28:50.271 --> 28:52.732
What do you mean "wait here"?

28:52.774 --> 28:54.734
You can't just leave us.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.653
I'll find out.
Where are you going?

28:56.736 --> 28:59.822
Leave us on our own.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.784
- Where's he gone?
- Come on!

29:12.335 --> 29:14.545
Joe, what is it?

29:22.804 --> 29:25.306
Go. Go.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.102
Back on the train, everyone!

29:36.234 --> 29:38.945
Get back
on the train, everyone!

29:46.119 --> 29:47.620
Hurry!

29:47.704 --> 29:51.958
Come on!

29:52.041 --> 29:53.626
Joe, hurry!

29:53.710 --> 29:57.046
Where's the key?

29:57.130 --> 30:00.633
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

30:00.717 --> 30:03.303
Quick!

30:06.139 --> 30:10.351
Alright, go. Go, go, go, go!

30:10.476 --> 30:12.603
- Quickly!
- Hurry up.

30:14.272 --> 30:17.150
Joe, get in!

30:17.233 --> 30:19.777
Joe, get in!
Wait!

30:19.861 --> 30:21.654
Come on!

30:21.738 --> 30:23.906
Wait!
Hurry, come on. Hurry!

30:23.990 --> 30:26.826
- Get in, quick.
- Come on, Joe!

30:26.909 --> 30:28.202
Wait!

30:28.286 --> 30:30.079
Let's go, come on!

30:34.625 --> 30:37.754
- Help me!
- Get in, get in! In, in!

30:37.837 --> 30:40.089
Shut the fucking door!

31:00.568 --> 31:04.113
We need to move her.
Someone help me get her up!

31:12.997 --> 31:15.416
We need to get her up.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.169
Help me, please.
Lift, lift. Please.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.880
And lift. Lift her up.
Come on. OK, lift.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.299
Calm down,
shh, calm down.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.718
Everyone, step back!

31:25.760 --> 31:29.389
We'll lie her down
on the chair.

31:29.430 --> 31:33.393
Try and calm her down.
Here, take this.

31:33.476 --> 31:35.144
Alright, wrap it round.

31:35.228 --> 31:39.148
Above the wound. Tighter!
Pull it down. Step back.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.237
What can you see?

31:44.320 --> 31:46.114
I can't see anything!

31:46.197 --> 31:48.991
Get the first aid kit!
And water!

31:49.117 --> 31:51.285
Shh.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.832
Breathe, breathe.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.920
- Hurry up.
- Get some water!

32:01.003 --> 32:03.840
You'll be fine.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.925
- Shh...
- Breathe, breathe.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.593
Everybody just stay calm!

32:07.635 --> 32:09.804
I don't know what I'm doing.

32:13.391 --> 32:15.935
Oh, my God, I don't know
what I'm doing.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.271
Pressure on,
get the pressure on!

32:20.273 --> 32:22.442
What do you see?
I can't see anything!

32:22.483 --> 32:24.527
The door! Is it secure?

32:24.610 --> 32:26.279
Check the door.

32:29.532 --> 32:31.075
Just over there.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.829
What the fuck was that?

32:35.663 --> 32:37.206
Keep her quiet,
for fuck's sake!

32:37.290 --> 32:38.958
Shh...

32:41.085 --> 32:44.213
Get her to shut the fuck up.

32:49.302 --> 32:52.597
What is that?

33:04.650 --> 33:07.236
Fuck. Fuck.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.708
Shh...

33:26.714 --> 33:28.716
Shh... Please.

33:39.977 --> 33:43.689
It's gone. It's gone.
It's gone.

33:51.531 --> 33:53.199
We've got to get her
to a hospital.

33:53.282 --> 33:55.368
We need to get her
to a hospital.

33:55.409 --> 34:00.540
Joe, we've got
to call someone.
Joe! Joe!

34:00.623 --> 34:02.416
Joe. Joe...

34:02.500 --> 34:04.919
Joe! Joe!
We need to call someone.

34:05.002 --> 34:08.797
We need to call... call someone.
Just get someone, Joe.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.132
Now! Now! Go, now!

34:16.806 --> 34:18.558
This is the Eastborough
sprinter service

34:18.641 --> 34:20.768
requesting immediate
emergency assistance.

34:20.851 --> 34:23.228
Hello?

34:23.312 --> 34:25.106
Hello?

34:25.940 --> 34:27.567
Hello?

34:28.442 --> 34:30.069
Hello?!

34:36.199 --> 34:37.784
You alright, mate?

34:37.868 --> 34:40.329
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.331
This was working earlier.

34:42.415 --> 34:45.293
How about getting
the engine started?

34:45.376 --> 34:48.420
I haven't got the first clue
about trains. Do you?

34:48.462 --> 34:51.757
I know engines.
Dirt bikes, lawnmowers.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.552
It's my old man's business, repairs.

34:54.635 --> 34:58.306
- There's your problem.
- The fuel leak?

34:58.389 --> 35:00.975
Yeah, the line must have split
when we crashed.

35:01.058 --> 35:03.352
There might be some left
in the tank, but...

35:03.436 --> 35:07.481
without pressure we ain't gonna
be able to restart her.

35:07.565 --> 35:09.859
We're going nowhere
till it's patched.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.700
I better tell the others.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.479
We're just gonna have
to sit tight and wait for help.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.649
My wife needs
medical attention now!

35:49.732 --> 35:54.320
And meanwhile we're just
a train full of bear bait.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.448
It wasn't a bear.

35:58.616 --> 36:00.326
Bears don't howl.

36:01.035 --> 36:04.497
What was it then, a wolf?
A dog couldn't do that.

36:04.580 --> 36:08.501
There haven't been any bears
or wolves round here for centuries.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.670
What animal did that to her?

36:10.753 --> 36:13.297
It wasn't an animal.

36:16.258 --> 36:18.928
It was more like a man.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.683
Just lie back, love.
You need to rest.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.185
No, you're not listening.
You don't understand.

36:26.268 --> 36:28.896
It wasn't an animal.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.526
She's in shock.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.408
What happened
to the driver?

36:44.120 --> 36:46.622
What?

36:48.916 --> 36:50.626
What aren't you telling us?

37:07.643 --> 37:10.438
That's inside the train.
Inside?

37:15.067 --> 37:18.738
What are you doing?
No, that's not a good idea.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.121
Oh, fuck.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.937
You've got a knife, right?

37:52.021 --> 37:53.939
Why would I have a knife?

38:10.331 --> 38:12.166
Get a key!

38:25.805 --> 38:27.598
Hurry UP!

38:34.522 --> 38:36.482
No, no!
Fuckin' hell!

38:36.565 --> 38:40.152
Ow! Oh, fuck!

38:41.904 --> 38:43.614
Fuck.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.496
Stinks of piss down here.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.832
Who are you?

38:52.873 --> 38:56.877
He's one of the passengers
from earlier. Help him up.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.225
I don't-I don't believe this.

39:11.308 --> 39:17.690
So... So what you're saying...

39:17.731 --> 39:19.859
is...

39:19.900 --> 39:23.863
is that we've definitely
gone past Barrock's Hill?

39:27.366 --> 39:29.577
Have you not heard anything
we just told you?

39:35.207 --> 39:38.377
No signal.
What a surprise.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.215
I can't believe
I missed my stop.

39:47.928 --> 39:50.347
It's great to have you on board.

40:12.369 --> 40:14.914
Try to hold still, love.

40:32.389 --> 40:35.351
She's got a fever.
Shock?

40:37.144 --> 40:39.939
I've dealt
with a dog bite before,

40:39.980 --> 40:42.524
but I don't know
what I'm doing.

40:42.608 --> 40:45.694
Ellen, just sit down,
stay calm for a minute.

40:45.778 --> 40:47.321
Sit down.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.462
There you are.

41:06.173 --> 41:07.549
You OK?

41:09.301 --> 41:10.928
What's wrong with her?

41:14.098 --> 41:16.475
They're looking after her,
don't worry.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.060
She'll be fine.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.022
There was so much blood.

41:25.025 --> 41:28.070
My daughter's got shoes like those.
They're cool.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.990
Thanks.

41:31.031 --> 41:33.325
She cannot wait
to be a teenager.

41:33.409 --> 41:35.160
She hardly ever talks
to me anymore.

41:35.202 --> 41:37.121
She says that I embarrass her.

41:39.415 --> 41:40.833
You seem pretty nice.

41:46.505 --> 41:49.299
My mum's my best friend.
Really?

41:52.177 --> 41:54.138
There's hope for me yet, then.

41:57.307 --> 41:59.935
Won't she wonder
where you are?

42:00.019 --> 42:02.855
No. She's usually in bed
by the time I get home,

42:02.938 --> 42:05.107
and weekends
she's with her dad, so I never...

42:07.985 --> 42:09.903
It's back.

42:15.617 --> 42:16.952
What the fuck is that?

42:23.542 --> 42:26.295
Maybe someone's come to...
Shh...

42:30.215 --> 42:31.425
What the fuck is it?

42:31.508 --> 42:33.260
Stay back.

42:33.343 --> 42:34.887
Where's it going?

42:34.928 --> 42:36.889
Just be quiet. Shh.

42:39.433 --> 42:41.935
- Whose phone is that?
- Not mine!

42:42.019 --> 42:44.897
- What the fuck?
- It must be someone's!

42:44.980 --> 42:47.483
Someone's got reception!

42:47.566 --> 42:50.402
It's yours. Answer it!
Oh, my God. It's me.

42:50.444 --> 42:52.321
Well, answer it, then.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.075
Hello? Hello?
Who is it?

42:56.158 --> 42:58.577
Mum, you've got to listen to me.
Something's happened.

42:58.619 --> 43:01.330
Tell her where we are.
Please, Mum, no, please.

43:01.413 --> 43:03.415
Give me the phone.
Tell her where we are!

43:03.499 --> 43:05.584
Out of my way.
Give me that thing!

43:05.667 --> 43:08.587
Get off me!

43:17.054 --> 43:19.681
Help me!

43:38.784 --> 43:40.494
Come on!

43:50.295 --> 43:52.214
Shh, shh, shh!

43:52.297 --> 43:54.967
Shut up! Shut up!

43:55.050 --> 43:57.302
I think it's gone.

43:57.344 --> 44:00.055
What is it?
Does anyone know?

44:00.139 --> 44:01.974
It ain't a fucking dog,
I can tell you that.

44:02.015 --> 44:03.475
Shut up!

44:03.517 --> 44:04.893
We can't just leave her!

44:04.977 --> 44:07.020
She's gone!
We've got to go back!

44:07.104 --> 44:09.648
Hey, hey, come back!

44:09.690 --> 44:11.817
She might still be alive,
We can't just leave her!

44:11.900 --> 44:14.319
Why did you stop me?
I could have got her!

44:14.403 --> 44:17.322
I was trying to save you!

44:17.406 --> 44:20.409
It was too late for her!
It's your fault!

44:20.492 --> 44:22.035
Stop it.

44:22.119 --> 44:23.495
You still wanna sit and wait?

44:23.579 --> 44:25.080
I didn't know this would happen!

44:25.164 --> 44:26.582
You've got to do something!

44:26.665 --> 44:28.167
It's too easy for it to get in.

44:28.250 --> 44:29.418
What are we gonna do?

44:29.501 --> 44:31.170
Stop listening to this prick.

44:31.211 --> 44:32.588
He's doing his best!

44:32.671 --> 44:34.506
I shouldn't even
be on this train.

44:34.548 --> 44:36.133
Enough!

44:41.221 --> 44:43.432
Do you all wanna die tonight?

44:43.515 --> 44:47.019
Cos if you do, you just
carry on whinging and arguing,

44:47.102 --> 44:50.189
and soon enough,
that thing out there,

44:50.272 --> 44:52.482
he'll take care of it for you.

44:54.484 --> 44:59.156
But if you still intend to get home,
then start acting like it.

45:00.741 --> 45:02.367
It's an animal.

45:02.409 --> 45:05.579
Animals hunt
what's easy to catch.

45:07.122 --> 45:09.208
And look at us.

45:09.291 --> 45:10.959
We're sitting ducks here.

45:18.759 --> 45:22.387
So let's try and make it
a little bit harder

45:22.471 --> 45:24.431
for the bastard, shall we?

45:27.768 --> 45:29.686
Have you got any tools
on this train?

46:06.056 --> 46:09.810
What's wrong with you?
Dodgy kebab gave me the shits.

46:15.148 --> 46:19.278
Oh! It's not easy, is it?
What?

46:19.361 --> 46:23.073
Here. Here, <i>I'll</i> help you. Yeah.

46:25.659 --> 46:27.327
Thank you.

46:28.996 --> 46:34.668
Listen, I'm sorry about being
such a cow to you before.

46:34.751 --> 46:38.880
It's just... I've spent too much
of my life on this train.

46:40.048 --> 46:41.925
Tell me about it.

47:32.100 --> 47:35.937
Jenny, here's
some water, love.

47:36.021 --> 47:38.106
Oh, sorry,
it's nearly empty.

47:38.190 --> 47:41.860
Was there any water anywhere?
Joe's got the last bottle.

47:41.943 --> 47:43.403
Right.

47:48.825 --> 47:51.536
I was told you might have
a bottle of water.

47:51.620 --> 47:53.163
Yeah, course.

48:03.507 --> 48:05.550
What was her name?

48:05.634 --> 48:07.386
Who?

48:07.469 --> 48:10.764
The girl...
The girl who was...

48:10.847 --> 48:13.225
Oh. Ooh, um...

48:22.359 --> 48:24.361
I don't know.

48:28.657 --> 48:30.075
Do you have any children?

48:30.158 --> 48:35.247
Yes. I've got a daughter
who's about to be 13.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.791
Oh.
You?

48:42.754 --> 48:44.923
Wasn't to be.

48:47.342 --> 48:49.761
We wanted to, but...

48:49.845 --> 48:52.472
Like we always say,
we have each other

48:52.556 --> 48:55.058
and that's
the most important thing.

49:01.398 --> 49:02.732
Thank you.

49:02.816 --> 49:06.445
And thank you
for getting us in here.

49:06.486 --> 49:08.029
No problem.

49:10.157 --> 49:12.325
You're doing alright, you know.

49:34.764 --> 49:38.894
It's coming back, you know.
Sorry?

49:38.977 --> 49:41.521
Our friend out there
is coming back.

49:41.605 --> 49:44.024
Might not.
Might have had enough.

49:48.278 --> 49:49.654
Yeah.

49:52.991 --> 49:55.202
Let me show you something.

49:59.289 --> 50:03.919
Country house.
Wife, kids, dog, the works.

50:05.086 --> 50:06.755
But then there's this.

50:07.589 --> 50:09.841
A city flat.

50:09.883 --> 50:11.718
Five minutes' walk
from the office,

50:11.801 --> 50:13.595
nice view of Tower Bridge,

50:13.678 --> 50:16.640
perfect for entertaining
young ladies.

50:18.183 --> 50:20.227
Discreet.

50:20.310 --> 50:23.897
Two worlds never meet,
and everyone is happy.

50:23.980 --> 50:25.106
Good for you.

50:25.190 --> 50:28.652
The point is, we do
what we have to to get by.

50:30.028 --> 50:32.948
Sometimes it ain't nice.

50:38.828 --> 50:42.749
Take this lot.
Old, weak, afraid.

50:42.832 --> 50:45.710
They're natural born victims.

50:45.752 --> 50:49.130
And when that thing comes back,
when it gets in here,

50:49.214 --> 50:51.591
you can stand with them
and wait your turn to die,

50:51.675 --> 50:54.886
or you can use your keys
and open one of these doors,

50:54.970 --> 50:58.932
and maybe...
maybe you and I...

50:59.015 --> 51:01.726
can get out of this alive.

51:05.814 --> 51:08.483
Survival of the fittest,
my friend.

51:12.737 --> 51:13.780
You think about it.

51:19.327 --> 51:21.162
Jesus.

51:21.246 --> 51:23.999
Jenny... Jenny.

51:24.124 --> 51:27.002
Can you hear me?

51:28.712 --> 51:30.171
What the fuck's
happening to her?

51:30.255 --> 51:32.382
She needs help.
She's sick.

51:32.465 --> 51:34.676
But why are
her teeth falling out?

51:34.759 --> 51:36.636
Shut it!
Look, old man,

51:36.720 --> 51:39.097
I am just saying that...
I know what you're saying.

51:39.180 --> 51:41.516
Stop it!

51:41.600 --> 51:44.019
Joe? Joe?

51:46.146 --> 51:47.230
Someone's missing.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.740
The football guy.
He said he needed a shit.

51:56.823 --> 51:59.284
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

51:59.367 --> 52:03.121
He's gone.
You don't know that.

52:03.204 --> 52:04.664
Just give him a minute.

52:09.586 --> 52:11.338
Wait here.

52:13.548 --> 52:15.467
Hurry up.

52:15.550 --> 52:18.178
- Hey. hey, where's he going?
- What's happening?

52:18.261 --> 52:19.804
Don't wanna lose anyone else.

52:19.846 --> 52:21.306
It's fine.
Just one minute.

52:21.389 --> 52:22.891
I'm not leaving this open.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.397
Paul?
What?

52:29.481 --> 52:32.901
Paul, come on, hurry up,
open the door.

52:32.984 --> 52:35.170
You've got to get in the other carriage.
It's not safe here.

52:35.236 --> 52:36.571
Fuck's sake.
Paul?

52:36.655 --> 52:37.989
What?!
Paul, hurry up.

52:38.073 --> 52:39.699
I can't do a shit
in peace.

52:39.783 --> 52:42.869
No, it's not safe.
For fuck's sake.

52:42.952 --> 52:45.705
Come on. Come on!

52:45.789 --> 52:48.750
The... The door...

52:48.833 --> 52:51.002
What?
I can't open the door!

52:53.588 --> 52:55.674
Oh, fuck.
The door is jammed!

53:00.595 --> 53:02.430
Right... That's it.

53:02.514 --> 53:03.682
What are you doing?

53:03.765 --> 53:05.350
He's been long enough.

53:07.686 --> 53:11.940
Shit! Help me!
Help me!

53:12.023 --> 53:13.066
Let me go!

53:15.110 --> 53:17.237
Get me the fuck out!

53:17.320 --> 53:20.240
Shit! Get me out of here!

53:20.323 --> 53:24.369
Get me out! Fuck!
Get me out!

53:24.411 --> 53:26.621
It's fucking broke...

53:58.278 --> 54:00.488
Come on!

54:00.572 --> 54:03.074
Fucking open the fucking door!

54:12.375 --> 54:14.461
What are you doing?
Getting out of here.

54:14.544 --> 54:16.629
We're trapped
on this fucking train.

54:16.713 --> 54:18.923
What about Joe?
He made his choice.

54:19.007 --> 54:21.593
At least he had the guts to try.
You should have gone with him!

54:21.676 --> 54:23.011
You should be helping him!

54:23.094 --> 54:24.429
Just get out the fucking train!

54:24.512 --> 54:26.473
We need to get them out, too!

54:26.556 --> 54:29.100
Fuck!
Hurry up!

54:29.184 --> 54:31.269
The key.

54:37.484 --> 54:39.694
Open the fucking door!

54:39.819 --> 54:42.071
Fucking hell...

54:48.745 --> 54:50.371
Let's barricade it, quick!

54:54.167 --> 54:56.377
Hold it, hold it!

54:56.461 --> 54:59.172
It's coming, it's coming!

54:59.255 --> 55:02.592
- It's not gonna open!
- Hey!

55:04.719 --> 55:07.555
We need your help!
Pass me that.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.178
Do something! Help him!

56:54.829 --> 56:57.707
Fucking die!

57:00.501 --> 57:03.504
It's dead. It's OK.

57:03.588 --> 57:05.590
Fucking let go!

57:05.673 --> 57:07.634
It's dead.

57:11.012 --> 57:13.640
Shh... It's gone. OK.

57:15.642 --> 57:18.770
It's OK.

57:18.811 --> 57:19.979
It's OK.

57:34.577 --> 57:37.163
What did we just kill?

57:38.873 --> 57:40.625
It's a man.

57:41.918 --> 57:46.130
But its legs... and its teeth...

57:47.840 --> 57:49.342
are more like a dog's.

57:49.425 --> 57:51.386
More like a wolf's.

57:54.722 --> 57:56.683
What?
Just saying.

57:56.766 --> 57:59.310
What are you saying?

57:59.352 --> 58:01.813
Isn't it obvious?

58:01.854 --> 58:04.232
We're looking
at a werewolf.

58:04.315 --> 58:08.653
What, like a full moon
and silver bullet sort of thing?

58:08.695 --> 58:11.572
No...

58:11.656 --> 58:15.660
But look at the legs,
triplejointed,

58:15.702 --> 58:18.162
the eyes, teeth.

58:18.204 --> 58:23.167
Whatever it is, it's some kind
of hybrid between man and wolf.

58:23.251 --> 58:25.586
It's wearing a ring. Look.

58:27.964 --> 58:29.966
It used to be like us.

58:31.551 --> 58:35.263
Perhaps it's a disease.
Like a mutation.

58:35.346 --> 58:38.057
Something you catch
from animals.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.395
Or a bite.

59:09.964 --> 59:14.302
You're all too young to remember
the Thornton Forest rail crash.

59:14.385 --> 59:15.511
1963.

59:18.264 --> 59:23.102
Late night express came
off the tracks, somewhere near here.

59:25.229 --> 59:28.983
When the emergency services
got to them,

59:29.067 --> 59:32.111
there was no one left to save.

59:32.195 --> 59:36.574
All sorts of tales
about what they found,

59:36.616 --> 59:40.661
bodies half eaten by animals,
some just gone.

59:44.082 --> 59:46.918
They never did find out
what really happened.

59:49.087 --> 59:51.839
I never gave it much
thought after that.

01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:01.808
Until tonight.

01:00:04.185 --> 01:00:05.603
So this has happened before.

01:00:05.645 --> 01:00:08.564
We've killed it now,
so we're sweet.

01:01:01.284 --> 01:01:02.493
Jenny?

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.287
Jen?

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:07.498
Honey?

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:10.751
She's one of them.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.673
She's fucking one of them.

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:18.009
You leave her alone!
She's sick.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.594
No, she's not.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.888
She is infected.

01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:25.224
We all know it.

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:29.187
And if we are gonna survive,
she has to go.

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.856
You touch one hair
on my Jenny's head

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:34.775
and <i>I'll</i> break your bloody neck.

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.861
I don't think so, old man.

01:01:36.944 --> 01:01:39.697
Stay away from her, OK?

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:44.076
Alright.

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:53.502
No, no, no!

01:01:55.463 --> 01:01:58.883
No, no, no, no, no!

01:02:01.344 --> 01:02:03.221
Stop it!

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:04.972
Leave her alone!

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:09.060
Why don't you take a seat, sir.

01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:11.896
Ged! Ged, where am I?

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:15.066
Alright, Jenny.

01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:17.109
Where am I?

01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:19.070
Thank you.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.905
- Give me your fucking belt.
- What?

01:02:20.988 --> 01:02:22.865
Give me your belt!

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:27.161
- Tie him down.
- With pleasure.

01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:34.502
Her, too.

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:37.129
We can't stay here.

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:39.423
We're not going to.

01:02:59.318 --> 01:03:02.488
You've done this before.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:05.032
Dirty bitch.

01:03:05.116 --> 01:03:07.118
Ow!

01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:17.169
If we can find the leak,
patch it up,

01:03:17.253 --> 01:03:18.921
there might be enough left
to get us moving.

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:21.007
All we need is enough
to get clear of the woods.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.633
Who's going?
Me.

01:03:22.675 --> 01:03:24.468
I'm the only one
who knows how.

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:27.805
I could do
with a lookout, though.

01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:29.348
I'll do it.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.184
That's that sorted then.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:36.314
So the ASBO kid's
fixing the train?

01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:39.984
I know engines, you prick.
Yeah, right.

01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:42.028
I got accepted onto
an engineering course, actually.

01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:45.197
That's why I was in town today.

01:03:45.281 --> 01:03:46.574
Impressive.

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:49.994
Nuhuhuhuhuh.

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:52.997
Watch him.
Of course.

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:57.668
Let's go.

01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:02.882
Engine lights.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:05.760
These go green, it means
I've patched the leak.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:08.429
Fuel gauge.
That needle bounces up,

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.015
you need to turn on
the ignition here.

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.059
Then the main light
should come on.

01:04:13.142 --> 01:04:16.270
That's it?
Not quite.

01:04:16.354 --> 01:04:19.690
Next you need to prime the pump.
Pull down hard here.

01:04:19.774 --> 01:04:23.361
Engage forward
on the column,

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:25.571
then you need to push
forward on the accelerator.

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:29.408
Nice and slowly.
Drive us out of this shithole, yeah?

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.619
Oh, and if you could remember
to pick me up on the way out,

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.705
<i>I'll</i> buy you a beer.
Is it true?

01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:36.707
About your interview?

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:38.501
Yeah, pretty much.

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:42.213
I saw you chuck
your jacket and tie in the bin.

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:45.883
Huh. Stupid cow said I needed
A-levels, didn't she?

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:49.929
Guess we'll see
if she was right.

01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:55.142
I think you
should say something.

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:09.865
This is your guard speaking.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:14.245
<i>I'd like to apologize
once again</i>

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:17.498
<i>for the delay to your journey
this evening.</i>

01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:27.758
A few hours ago
we were strangers.

01:05:27.842 --> 01:05:29.885
Most of you probably wish
we still were.

01:05:34.348 --> 01:05:37.143
But we're gonna try
and get out of here now.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.982
We're gonna do
whatever it takes to survive.

01:05:44.859 --> 01:05:45.943
Together.

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.737
<i>All of us.</i>

01:05:52.283 --> 01:05:55.161
<i>I know you all
just want to get home.</i>

01:05:59.415 --> 01:06:01.500
<i>So do I.</i>

01:06:12.595 --> 01:06:14.638
Next stop, Eastborough.

01:06:18.726 --> 01:06:20.102
You ready?

01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:23.939
Yeah.

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:54.678
Shine it down there.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.612
This is it.

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:19.453
Keep an eye out, yeah?

01:07:26.919 --> 01:07:28.754
OK...

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:47.982
You don't remember me
at all, do you?

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:53.028
Should I?

01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:54.989
I've been trying
to place you all night.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.825
Must be three years ago now?

01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:00.661
I came for an interview
at Naughton and Price Brokers.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.337
I thought it was going
quite well, actually.

01:08:02.413 --> 01:08:05.374
But you couldn't stop
looking down my top.

01:08:08.877 --> 01:08:12.756
You had a tan line where your
wedding ring should have been.

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:16.218
And? Well, you obviously
didn't make the grade.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.678
Oh, well, I was
more than qualified.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.179
But you were more interested

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:21.640
in taking me back home
for a followup.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.979
Yes...

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:35.404
But you're right.
I don't remember you.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.950
But I know your type.
Oh, yes?

01:08:39.992 --> 01:08:44.747
You arrive one day
in my office, full of sparkle...

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.957
happy to fight it out
with the boys

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:51.045
for a seat at the big table.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:54.214
And then after a couple of years
you swan off for nine months.

01:08:57.635 --> 01:09:01.513
And when you return,
you're tired all the time,

01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:04.224
wracked by guilt,

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:07.478
all that baby weight
making it oh-so-hard

01:09:07.519 --> 01:09:09.772
to fight your way
back up the ladder.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:15.819
No more sparkle.

01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:17.988
Jesus.

01:09:18.072 --> 01:09:20.073
I feel sorry for your wife.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.203
Don't you worry about her.

01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:27.665
Hope you haven't got
any kids to fuck up, too.

01:09:33.379 --> 01:09:35.839
Come on, Jenny. Hold on.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:38.091
Gonna get you
out of here soon.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:40.176
Use your eyes, granddad.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.179
There is no helping her.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.848
She just needs the hospital.
They'll be able to do something.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:49.185
If we don't do something
about her now,

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:50.645
it'll be too late.

01:10:19.675 --> 01:10:21.260
Joe?

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:28.434
Why did you want that
stupid promotion anyway?

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:33.230
I don't know.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:36.483
I guess I thought
I could change something.

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:38.402
Make people notice me.

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:40.112
It's what you do that matters,

01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:42.322
not what it says
on your name badge.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:46.285
You've helped those people.

01:10:47.745 --> 01:10:51.123
You've helped all of us.
Hmm.

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:54.668
I'm seriously thinking about
a change of career after tonight.

01:11:04.887 --> 01:11:08.307
Fuck, come on.
Fuck, where are you?

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.517
Come on, come on.

01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:14.897
Matt... Matt?

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:18.150
Chuck me the tape.

01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:22.112
Found the leak.

01:11:22.196 --> 01:11:23.822
Underqualified, my arse.

01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:27.242
Here, chuck me that wrench.

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:30.037
Ah, there we go.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.878
OK.

01:11:38.796 --> 01:11:40.672
Ah, fuck.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.968
Listen, um, about before,

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:46.470
all that business with the ax.

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:48.472
I don't know
what came over me.

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:49.598
OK, mate.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.643
OK...

01:11:57.898 --> 01:12:00.359
Help...

01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:01.985
Help me...

01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:04.363
Get that light on me, buddy.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:20.087
Matt, keep that light on me.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:23.006
Matt! Matt! What the fuck
are you doing?

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:26.718
For fuck's sake...

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.810
Hello?

01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:55.205
Help me!

01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:58.417
Hello?
Help!

01:13:02.504 --> 01:13:04.214
Where are you?

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:14.099
Help!

01:13:14.182 --> 01:13:16.685
Look, I...

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:22.149
About before, I...

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:24.276
I'm sorry, I...

01:13:24.359 --> 01:13:26.445
It just all happened so quickly.

01:13:34.912 --> 01:13:36.830
Where are you?

01:13:46.757 --> 01:13:48.216
Help...

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:34.221
Oh, no.

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.811
Oh, fuck.

01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:43.647
Hey!

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.315
Help!

01:14:45.399 --> 01:14:47.693
Matthew!

01:14:47.776 --> 01:14:50.737
Fuck! She's fucking changing!

01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:53.573
Come on, let me out of here!
She's turning, come on!

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.659
There's one wolf out there

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:57.494
and there's one fucking wolf
in here.

01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:58.829
We're all gonna die!

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:00.831
Just shut up and let me think!

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:03.500
Hey! Help! Fuck!

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.293
Untie me, you stupid bitch!

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.338
Come on, come on, come on.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.007
Come on!

01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:11.967
This should be it.

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:21.601
Ellen! Quick!
He got the lights on.

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:24.521
Oh!
OK. Fuel...

01:15:24.646 --> 01:15:27.691
That one.
Right, what's next?

01:15:27.733 --> 01:15:30.277
Pump.
Prime the pump.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.530
Gears.

01:15:33.572 --> 01:15:36.616
OK, what are we doing?
Just wait. Gotta wait for it.

01:16:39.471 --> 01:16:41.056
Where are they?

01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:49.648
OK, let's go. Let's go.
No, we can't. Ellen, no!

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:56.947
Shit. Shit.

01:16:56.988 --> 01:17:00.200
Oh, my God. Come on.
We're moving.

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:03.745
Thank fuck!

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:08.125
Oh, God.

01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:10.752
We're moving, Jenny.
Can you-

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:15.298
Oh, my God.
What the...

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.925
Oh, my God!

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.885
Fucking hell!

01:17:18.969 --> 01:17:21.221
Fucking hell! Let me out
of here! Get me out of here!

01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:23.181
Do it, do it, do it!

01:17:26.226 --> 01:17:28.353
Hurry, hurry. Hurry up.

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:33.108
Help me.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:39.489
Jenny.

01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:43.076
It's working. No, look, it's working.
Look, it's working.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.288
It's working. Go, come on,
it's going, it's going.

01:17:47.956 --> 01:17:50.167
Christ!

01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:02.137
Help me!

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.639
Help me!

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:12.355
No! No, God, no.

01:18:14.983 --> 01:18:17.235
Oh, no!

01:18:33.293 --> 01:18:36.046
Please don't... Please don't...

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:39.090
Please don't...
Please, please don't kill me.

01:18:39.174 --> 01:18:41.384
No, no!

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:42.802
Jenny.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.352
No!

01:18:55.065 --> 01:18:57.359
Oh, shit.
Jenny.

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:09.996
Oh, God.

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.090
No... Stay away from me!

01:19:21.675 --> 01:19:22.842
Stay away!

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:30.850
Oh...

01:19:37.899 --> 01:19:40.277
No... No!

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.695
Fuck!

01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:46.449
No!

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:49.452
Why has it stopped?
What's happened?

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:57.377
Ellen, come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:20:09.097 --> 01:20:11.266
Stay away from me.

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:13.101
Stay away!

01:20:31.953 --> 01:20:33.163
Better late than never.

01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:38.418
Good to see you've
finally grown a pair.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.253
Joe! Joe!

01:20:40.337 --> 01:20:42.505
Come on! Come on then!

01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:44.466
Where's Kate?

01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:49.054
Where's Kate?

01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:52.015
She'd still be alive
if you hadn't tied me up.

01:21:23.254 --> 01:21:24.798
Where exactly
are we going to, boss?

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:27.926
The woods.
We'll never stand a chance.

01:21:35.642 --> 01:21:37.102
Unless one of us stays behind.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:58.081
Stop it!

01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:02.669
Back off!

01:22:02.794 --> 01:22:05.088
Get over there! Get back!

01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:09.426
Fucking bitch.

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:19.853
You really think you're
in control, don't you, Joe?

01:22:23.148 --> 01:22:25.275
You've finally become a man,

01:22:25.358 --> 01:22:28.528
and you've stood up to
the challenge well.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:30.280
Haven't you?

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:33.950
You think you've got it
all worked out, don't you?

01:22:37.162 --> 01:22:39.164
Oh, no.

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:54.929
Come on, then!

01:23:04.105 --> 01:23:05.982
Oi!

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:10.320
Fuck you, bitch.

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:16.493
Come on.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.702
Come on!

01:23:18.828 --> 01:23:20.747
Come on!

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.749
Come on, you fucking mutts!

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:25.710
Come on!

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:28.338
Get that door open.
Come on! Let's 'ave it!

01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:35.970
Go, go, go! Billy!

01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:38.181
Billy!

01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:42.894
Come on!

01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:20.598
Follow the track!
The track!

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:26.062
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

01:24:26.145 --> 01:24:27.730
Let's go!
Too late.

01:24:27.814 --> 01:24:28.648
What?
It's too late.

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:30.441
No, let's go!

01:24:30.525 --> 01:24:33.111
They're on to us.
No, let's go, Joe!

01:24:33.194 --> 01:24:36.030
There's a track.
There's a track there.

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:37.991
Joe!

01:24:40.827 --> 01:24:42.412
Come on.

01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.130
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:24:53.047 --> 01:24:55.925
No, no. No!

01:24:55.967 --> 01:24:58.636
Joe! Joe, no, come on!

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.430
You have to go.

01:25:00.513 --> 01:25:02.140
Come with me, Joe!

01:25:02.223 --> 01:25:04.601
Run! Ellen, run!

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:09.105
Go! Go!

01:25:40.428 --> 01:25:42.138
Come on!

01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:44.682
Come on!

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:13.104
Oh! Ow.

01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:17.984
First thing I'm gonna do
is buy this place

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:19.569
and burn it the fuck down.

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:36.252
Hello?

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:40.047
Who's there?

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.720
Hello?

01:27:52.351 --> 01:27:54.604
Joe?

01:27:54.645 --> 01:27:57.148
Where are you, mate?

01:27:57.231 --> 01:27:58.775
Joe?

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:17.877
Oh, fuck!
