00:18.967 --> 00:21.567

with a cool name for our team:

00:21.667 --> 00:23.333
The Woodsmen, right?

00:23.433 --> 00:25.000
That's, like, a badass name,

00:25.100 --> 00:27.367
and I thought of it 'cause
I'm the leader.

about a pedophile.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.900

the shots?

01:08.067 --> 01:10.467

You know that about me.

01:10.567 --> 01:12.367

you're a timber sports fan,

01:12.467 --> 01:15.767

I am your employer.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.967
Get to the back
of the house pronto.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.433
Thank you, bye.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.333
- One momento.

08:25.433 --> 08:26.800
- Diane, what are you doing?

08:26.900 --> 08:28.100
It's like you've never dealt
before.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.633
- * What do you want?

08:29.733 --> 08:31.167
- She's a whale.
- No, she's not.

08:31.267 --> 08:32.933
She's in great shape.
- She is in great shape.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.633
What I'm saying
is that she's loaded, okay?

08:34.733 --> 08:37.800
She's got cash,
and if we string her along,

08:37.900 --> 08:40.067
we can pay for the Vo and go
to the timber sports games.

08:40.133 --> 08:42.700
- Yeah, these are things that
I know, because I'm in charge.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.067
- No, no, no, you're an idiot,
and I'm in charge.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.767
- Of what, cranking down?

08:46.867 --> 08:49.267
'Cause that lotion
is not where I left it last.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.200
- Are you using my lotion?

08:51.300 --> 08:53.467
- Only when I'm in your room,
jerking off on your computer.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.933
- Absolutely do not ever
jerk off on my computer.

08:57.067 --> 08:59.067
- Fine, okay, I won't,

08:59.100 --> 09:01.500
but because I choose not to
from now on.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.967
- You know what?
Just get out, okay?

09:03.067 --> 09:05.067
I've got actual
in-charge-type work to do.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.067
- Work, like what?

09:06.100 --> 09:07.967
Work on your [bleep]?

09:08.067 --> 09:09.700
Ugh!

09:13.067 --> 09:15.100
- Damn it,
I didn't take my pants off.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.933
- All right, packed house.

09:19.067 --> 09:22.433
So the key to a successful
magic trick is distraction.

09:22.533 --> 09:23.567
That's where you come in.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.467
As my assistant,

09:25.567 --> 09:30.467
you need to be something that
the audience looks at while I--

09:30.567 --> 09:32.667
look up there--
perform my illusion, see?

09:32.767 --> 09:35.900
- Okay, cool, so I'm like
eye candy and all that.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.400
Is there anything that you want
me to do, like, specifically?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.700
- You know,
just do what feels right.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.500
You'll know when to do
the distraction, okay?

09:42.600 --> 09:43.967
- Okay.

09:44.067 --> 09:47.467
- But when it's time,
you distract.

09:47.567 --> 09:48.733
- Oh!

09:48.833 --> 09:49.933
You got it, man.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.100
I'll be a distraction.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.500
- Hello, and...
welcome!

09:55.600 --> 09:58.767
I am the resident magician,
Magic Blake,

09:58.867 --> 10:02.267
and this is my beautiful
assistant, Magic Carl.

10:02.367 --> 10:05.333
We start off with a card trick.

10:05.433 --> 10:07.600
You, sir, what's your name?

10:07.700 --> 10:09.433
Let me guess, Waymond.

10:09.533 --> 10:13.233
How'd I know? Go ahead
and pick a card, Waymond.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.800
Okay, what is the card?

10:14.900 --> 10:16.333
Don't tell me.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.100
Actually, don't you ever
tell me, all right?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.833
Put it back in the deck,
anywhere in the deck.

10:20.933 --> 10:24.233
Now Magic Carl is gonna go
to the other side of the stage,

10:24.333 --> 10:27.400
and I'm gonna go to the other
other side of the stage

10:27.500 --> 10:31.967
and visualize the card.

10:32.067 --> 10:35.833
Now, please, please make sure
that my assistant, Magic Carl,

10:35.933 --> 10:39.133
is placing that deck
very, very far away.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.167
[quietly] Distract 'em.
Distract 'em.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.800
Okay, so I'm just visualizing.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.367
Nothing to see, really,
over here.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.167
It's just me thinking,
visualizing, boring.

10:46.267 --> 10:47.200
[crowd gasps]

10:47.300 --> 10:48.700
And what--okay.
Whoa!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.800
Okay, whoa.
What are you doing?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.500
What are you--
what are you doing?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.567
- I'm just doing
what feels right, okay?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.700
- This is not right.
Please put your pants back on.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.500
- God, fine!
- Family show.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.800
- There's no kids here,
is there?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.200
- Well, I'm just saying--

11:01.300 --> 11:02.267
- There's no kids here.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.933
- All right, stop.

11:04.067 --> 11:05.633
- These are my best pants.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.800
I'm ruining my belt now.
Great.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.933
But she is sexy.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.567
- 24, your bet.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.900
- [groans]
I don't have any money left.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.067
I guess I should go.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.233
- What? No, don't do that.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.533
I will walk you to the ATM.

11:20.633 --> 11:21.700
It's about three miles away.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.867
We should get going.

11:22.967 --> 11:25.233
- I mean, this ring
is worth 5,000.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.067
Can I gamble that?

11:29.067 --> 11:30.600
- Yes, you can.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.700
- No, no, no, no.
$5,000? We can't--

11:32.800 --> 11:36.233
Pit boss DeMamp, please get
to the back of the house now.

11:36.333 --> 11:40.933
- Yes, and I will definitely
be right there, boss.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.933
Tang, can I see your shoe?

11:43.067 --> 11:45.067
- Adam,
we cannot handle that bet.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.900
Do not take that bet.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.967
Adam!

11:51.067 --> 11:52.367
[grunts]

11:53.933 --> 11:57.500
- And I visualized this.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.833
Queen of hearts,
what do you say?

11:58.933 --> 12:00.867
Waymond, is that your card?

12:00.967 --> 12:02.333
No?

12:02.433 --> 12:04.067
Okay, there had to be a mix-up
somewhere--

12:04.100 --> 12:05.067
- Hiyah!

12:05.133 --> 12:06.500
This is my show now, baby.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.900
They want to see my dick.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.333
- Helicopter your wang!

12:09.433 --> 12:10.933
- Got it, buddy.
That's all I want to do.

12:11.067 --> 12:13.200
- Stop, guys. Next trick.
Carl, get in the box.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.867
- No, you get
in the box, man.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.733
This puppetry of the penis,
it's so hot right now.

12:16.833 --> 12:18.867
They love it!
They love it.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.433
- If you could just
please get in the box.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.233
- You get in the box.
- Don't do that!

12:22.333 --> 12:24.900
- Get in the box, Magic Blake.
Get in the box, Magic Blake.

12:25.067 --> 12:27.567
- Carl, stop!
Please, this is my show!

12:27.667 --> 12:28.867
- Whoo!
- Please!

12:28.967 --> 12:30.767
- Shh.
- Stop encouraging him, please.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.867
Where is he?
This is not part of the show.

12:32.967 --> 12:34.600
Please, where are you, Carl?

12:34.700 --> 12:35.933
[screams]

12:36.067 --> 12:37.433
[cheers and applause]

12:37.533 --> 12:39.233
What was that?

12:40.833 --> 12:41.833
- Okay, I'm done.

12:41.933 --> 12:43.567
You can do your next trick now.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.067
And back to Magic Blake.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.667
- I'm gonna kill you,
you stupid idiot.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.433
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.633
That's not magic.
- I'm sorry.

12:50.733 --> 12:52.733
- I'll cut your freaking dick
off, then.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.100
[crying]

12:54.200 --> 12:55.267
My eye itches.

12:55.367 --> 12:56.933
- Ladies and gentlemen,

12:57.067 --> 12:58.667
we're gonna take a short
five-minute intermission.

12:58.767 --> 13:00.967
- Why does it itch?
Is it bleeding?

13:01.067 --> 13:02.133
Is it bleeding?
- It's fine.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.800
- Why did you do that?

13:03.900 --> 13:07.233
- I just need to verify
the authenticity of this ring.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.333
Yup, that's real.

13:08.433 --> 13:09.667
That is very hard.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.333
Actually hurt my tooth
a little bit.

13:11.433 --> 13:14.733
Diane, would you mind
getting this angel some chips?

13:14.833 --> 13:17.200
Changing 5,000.
- Whoo!

13:17.300 --> 13:19.067
- Spend up, guys.
- Adam, don't.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.333
We can't cover that.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.533
- Ders, just trust the math,
okay?

13:22.633 --> 13:26.700
As you know, the house
always wins.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
- Blackjack.

13:27.900 --> 13:30.133
- [squeals]
Oh, my God!

13:30.233 --> 13:32.633
Well, that's the most fun
I've had all week.

13:32.733 --> 13:35.633
I'll cash out now, fellas,
if you don't mind.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.200
- I always knew math was a hoax.

13:47.267 --> 13:49.600
- So we don't have it,
your money,

13:49.700 --> 13:52.333
but we could probably
cover half.

13:52.433 --> 13:53.933
- Half? I'm sorry.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.833
That's not how
this sort of thing works.

13:55.933 --> 14:02.100
- We can cover the other half
with IOUs and prizes.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.867
- Have you ever been
to a fondue restaurant?

14:03.967 --> 14:05.733
We'll take you to one
every Sunday for a month.

14:05.833 --> 14:07.700
The Melting Pot,
have you been there?

14:07.800 --> 14:11.067
- Of course she has, for
our 13th wedding anniversary.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.800
- Hi, honey, how was work?

14:12.900 --> 14:14.633
- Not bad, babe.

14:14.733 --> 14:18.300
- What is happening right now?

14:18.400 --> 14:19.733
You know Laura?

14:19.833 --> 14:21.933
- Of course I do. She's my wife.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.933
- These ass wipes
owe us 5 grand.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.500
- Is that right?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.467
- We do, but 5 grand,
we can't pay that.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.933
- We don't have that.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.333
- We don't have
that kind of money.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.267
Frank: Technically, you do.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.633
You got this house.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.400
You want your house back,

14:35.500 --> 14:37.067
you give me my 5 grand.

14:37.100 --> 14:40.433
Till then, get the [bleep] out
of my new casino.

14:40.533 --> 14:43.067
- Well, that was a disaster.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.967
Magic Carl just sexually
assaulted my face.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.167
Yeah.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.500
Oh, hello.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.067
I don't believe we've met.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.900
I'm Magic Blake,
in-house entertainment.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.333
- Pleasure.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.900
- [yawns loudly]

15:05.067 --> 15:07.667
- I hate sleeping on the floor.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.667
Only slept for, like,
seven hours or something.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.467
- You can thank Adam
for that

15:12.567 --> 15:14.067
and for taking
the world's dumbest bet.

15:14.167 --> 15:15.567
There's table limits
for a reason.

15:15.667 --> 15:18.400
- And there it is right there,
classic Ders:

15:18.500 --> 15:21.100
passing the blame when you're
too busy smacking off

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
to realize that I need
proper supervision.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.900
That's on you, but that dude
never would've punked us

15:26.067 --> 15:28.300
if we were all alphas, Blake.

15:28.400 --> 15:33.467
- I get it.
I am a beta B-word, yes,

15:33.567 --> 15:37.067
but, you know, maybe I thought
you guys, my alpha dogs,

15:37.167 --> 15:38.933
would protect me, okay?

15:39.067 --> 15:41.100
But you guys are so busy
fighting each other,

15:41.200 --> 15:43.300
you can't even come up
with a good plan.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.100
- Blake, I'm a hound dog,

15:45.200 --> 15:46.967
and I'm gonna howl at the moon,

15:47.067 --> 15:49.400
and I shouldn't have to worry
about protecting you, okay?

15:49.500 --> 15:54.300
- It might be time for us
to not be alpha dogs anymore

15:54.400 --> 15:55.800
and start being alpha lions.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.267
- We are all kinds of animals,
me and you.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.533
[both shrieking and snarling]

16:00.633 --> 16:03.967
[both barking]

16:04.067 --> 16:05.100
- Here's the plan:

16:05.200 --> 16:06.833
sneak in through the crawl space

16:06.933 --> 16:08.767
and then saw
through the bathroom floor.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.167
- Right, but also the plan

16:10.267 --> 16:11.933
is to play music
off my Bluetooth shower speakers

16:12.067 --> 16:13.867
through my phone so that they
don't hear us sawing--

16:13.967 --> 16:15.933
- Sawing into the bathroom floor

16:16.067 --> 16:18.067
so we can get the floor safe
and use it

16:18.100 --> 16:20.067
as a bargaining chip for Frank
and get the house back.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.933
- And go to the
timber sports tournament,

16:22.067 --> 16:23.400
and we bring sexy back.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.333
- Okay, as The Woodsmen...
- Right, yeah.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.267
- Parentheses,
not the pedophile movie

16:28.367 --> 16:29.867
but, like, badasses who can
knock a deer out

16:29.967 --> 16:31.667
with one punch,
close parentheses.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.167
Okay.
- Here is the spot.

16:33.267 --> 16:34.767
- Okay.

16:34.867 --> 16:37.533
- Whoa, dude,
huge wasps' nest.

16:37.633 --> 16:39.233
Just stay back.
Give me the saw, all right?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.067
- Okay, no,

16:41.133 --> 16:43.767
I carried the saw the whole way,
so I should get to saw first.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.267
- Dude, I saw first.
You saw second.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.100
That was the deal.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.200
- Yeah, 'cause I'm the closer,
good call. Here you go.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.767
- Whatever.
- Yeah, I close.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.833
- All right. Let me just make
a little groove here.

16:52.933 --> 16:54.500
- Get up in there.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.067
[upbeat music]

16:57.133 --> 16:59.433
Long and lean, baby.
- Long and strong.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.767
*

17:01.867 --> 17:03.967
- Okay, here,
you're about halfway. My turn.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.733
- No, I'm kind of in a groove.
Just back off.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.333
Stop!
Dude, I'm not--

17:07.433 --> 17:10.300
- Let me saw!
- Oh.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.067
- [screaming]
- Wasps, wasps!

17:14.133 --> 17:17.133
- Shh, be quiet! Ow!

17:17.233 --> 17:19.067
*

17:19.100 --> 17:21.167
They can hear us! Quiet!

17:21.267 --> 17:22.567
Shut up!

17:22.667 --> 17:24.067
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.667
[both yelling]

17:25.767 --> 17:27.567
Adam: They're biting me!

17:27.667 --> 17:29.567
Ow! Save me!

17:29.667 --> 17:32.067
Ow! Ow!

17:32.167 --> 17:33.700
- Cover the hole!
Cover the hole.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.400
- Oh, you are so slow at sawing.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.833
Oh, you look bad.
You look bad, like pepperoni--

17:42.400 --> 17:43.733
- Hey.
- What up?

17:43.833 --> 17:45.667
- We just stopped by
to check things out,

17:45.767 --> 17:47.067
make sure it's going well.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.367
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.067
- Yeah.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.500
- Do you mind if we head out
the front door, though?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.967
Because bee problem down there.

17:53.067 --> 17:56.467
- Yeah, the wasps itch,
so take care.

17:56.567 --> 17:57.900
- Thanks for your time.
Excuse me.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.533
- Grab 'em.

17:59.633 --> 18:00.867
- You don't have to.
- Ow!

18:00.967 --> 18:01.900
- Okay.

18:02.067 --> 18:03.467
- Ow, ow.

18:05.367 --> 18:09.867
- Hey, ass wipes,
let my friends go.

18:09.967 --> 18:11.900
- Good.

18:12.067 --> 18:13.833
You're just in time
for the ass kicking.

18:13.933 --> 18:15.200
- Oh, yeah?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.533
Letting your dogs
do your dirty work?

18:17.633 --> 18:19.067
Gone soft, Frank.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.633
- Excuse me?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.133
- You, me, mano e mano,
one on one.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.867
High-stakes pokey.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.967
I win, you guys get the hell
out of our house.

18:28.067 --> 18:29.333
You win...

18:29.433 --> 18:31.567
- Which he definitely will,
Blake.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.267
- There's the deed
to the old crib, huh?

18:36.367 --> 18:39.200
- Blake, no offense, but you
don't know how to gamble.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.067
- Shut the hell up! Okay?

18:41.100 --> 18:42.467
We did your plan.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.433
Your guys' plan didn't work,
all right?

18:44.533 --> 18:46.200
So now it's my turn
to make the plans.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.533
I'm the plan maker now,
alpha dog style.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.167
I don't give a [bleep].

18:51.267 --> 18:53.767
Start at the penis!

18:53.867 --> 18:55.533
Start at my penis.

19:05.767 --> 19:06.667
Frank: I'll tell you what.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.467
You fold right now,

19:08.567 --> 19:10.233
and I'll give you another shot
at that shrimp buffet

19:10.333 --> 19:12.067
before you hit the road
and don't come back.

19:12.167 --> 19:13.600
Blake: I'll tell you what.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.233
You fold right now,

19:15.333 --> 19:17.600
and I'll give you another crack
at the shrimp buffet

19:17.700 --> 19:21.067
before you go home, you.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.567
- That's exactly what I said.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.500
- Gentlemen, your card.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.467
- Full boat, sixes over aces.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.767
- Oh, damn it, Blake.
- Ah, Blake!

19:30.867 --> 19:33.900
They have fricking shrimps,
dude.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.300
- 7 and 8 diamond.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.167
That straight flush,
the high hand.

19:38.267 --> 19:40.967
- Oh, my God, we won!
- I won? We won?

19:41.067 --> 19:42.900
- All right!
- We won!

19:43.067 --> 19:44.500
[all yelling]

19:44.600 --> 19:46.667
Adam: Oh, my God.

19:46.767 --> 19:47.900
Anders: You got bluffed.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.367
- [laughs]

19:49.467 --> 19:52.467
Ah, but, yeah, dude,
you got to go, I guess.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.967
Bye.
- Bye-bye.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.333
- Let me be very clear.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.367
If I find out you guys
start running another table

19:58.467 --> 20:00.500
over at this house,
I will come back here

20:00.600 --> 20:02.033
and break your goddamn necks.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.800
You can bet on it.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.867
- Bet--oh, that was pretty funny
bringing bet back.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.833
- And I'm absolutely [bleep]
serious.

20:08.933 --> 20:10.567
- Yeah, duly noted.
- Truly noted, even.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.533
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Frank.

20:13.633 --> 20:14.733
- Good job, Goonie.

20:14.833 --> 20:15.800
- Hey, good dealing out there.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.300
- Just put these chairs in here.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.800
- Love the hair, man.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.133
Friends don't let
friends get haircuts.

20:20.233 --> 20:23.000
- Karate kick.
- Yeah, bud!

20:23.100 --> 20:25.133
- What the frick, man?

20:25.233 --> 20:27.567
You did it.
Oh, wait a second.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.400
Dude, did you have, like,
a card up your sleeve

20:29.500 --> 20:31.400
'cause you've been
studying magic for your shows,

20:31.500 --> 20:32.800
picked up some tricks?

20:32.900 --> 20:34.867
Adam: That's smart.
- Way alpha.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.033
- No, actually, I didn't.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.833
I just kind of bet it all.

20:37.933 --> 20:42.367
Yeah, put my nuts on the table,
and then I did the damn thing.

20:42.467 --> 20:45.233
- So you could've lost
everything.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.600
- Yeah.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.467
But who's the alpha dog now?
[barks]

20:49.567 --> 20:51.933
- I guess we still are,
because you only did, like,

20:52.033 --> 20:53.400
one alpha dog thing.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.400
- And we do alpha shit,
like, every day, boy!

20:56.500 --> 20:57.600
Alpha dogs, sound off!

20:57.700 --> 20:59.200
- Hoo-rah!

20:59.300 --> 21:02.100
[both yelling]

21:02.200 --> 21:03.600
- Hoo, hoo, hoo!

21:03.700 --> 21:08.500
both: Hoo-rah! Hoo-rah, hoo-rah!
Hoo-rah!

21:08.600 --> 21:10.167
- Nice.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.333
- Beta bitch right here.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.067
- Beta bitch, beta bitch.
- Who's the beta bitch?

21:18.100 --> 21:19.833
- Beta bitch, beta bitch.
- You the beta bitch.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.833
- Beta bitch, beta bitch.
- You the beta bitch.

21:21.933 --> 21:22.967
- Beta bitch, beta bitch.

21:23.067 --> 21:23.967
- Beta, beta, beta...

21:24.067 --> 21:25.300
both: Beta, beta, beta.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.700
- Stop.
- You beta bitch, beta bitch.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.700
- Stop.
- You beta bitch, beta bitch.
