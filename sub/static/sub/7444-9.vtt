00:06.101 --> 00:08.057
It's a jungle out there.

00:16.541 --> 00:18.657
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.901 --> 00:38.857
It's a jungle out there.

01:24.021 --> 01:25.746
Oh!

01:25.781 --> 01:27.426
What would you do without me?

01:27.461 --> 01:29.661
Live a life of squalor and disorder.

01:29.696 --> 01:31.861
Yeah, don't forget the celibacy.

01:31.896 --> 01:32.850
What?!

01:40.821 --> 01:42.466
G'day.

01:42.501 --> 01:44.701
Guess who just got back from London.

01:44.736 --> 01:46.986
Oh, you're kidding.

01:47.021 --> 01:52.573
# Molasses
in the moonlight... #

01:54.621 --> 01:56.601
After his brother
was gunned down

01:56.636 --> 01:58.546
in the driveway of his own home,

01:58.581 --> 02:02.981
Jason Moran had moved up
the hit list, and everyone knew it.

02:03.016 --> 02:04.666
We got his parole conditions altered

02:04.701 --> 02:07.221
so he could leave the country
and be out of harm's way.

02:07.256 --> 02:09.741
But after only a few months overseas,
he turned up again,

02:09.776 --> 02:12.538
just like a bad penny.

02:12.573 --> 02:15.266
# Had ourselves a time

02:15.301 --> 02:20.786
# Molasses in the moonlight

02:20.821 --> 02:25.497
# You left my heart
on the bum again... #

02:28.221 --> 02:30.581
# Oh, the moonlight
seems to call your name

02:30.616 --> 02:34.106
# Molasses ain't the same

02:34.141 --> 02:38.821
# Don't think I'll ever care
for another can

02:38.856 --> 02:41.386
# What'll I do? #

02:41.421 --> 02:43.861
Jason wanted
to square the ledger.

02:43.896 --> 02:45.906
But so did Carl Williams.

02:45.941 --> 02:47.786
He'd promised himself he'd never rest

02:47.821 --> 02:51.941
until both the Moran boys
were six feet underground,

02:51.976 --> 02:53.852
and the job was only half done.

03:01.461 --> 03:03.257
FUCK!

03:03.292 --> 03:05.054
Fuck it!

03:06.581 --> 03:09.141
So we spent a truckload of cash
to send you overseas.

03:09.176 --> 03:11.221
Now here you are,
back again like a bad smell.

03:11.256 --> 03:14.021
Yeah, well,
England's full of bad smells

03:14.056 --> 03:15.506
and bloody Poms in queues.

03:15.541 --> 03:19.061
What, it would have killed you
to wait in one of them, would it?

03:19.096 --> 03:20.506
So how much?

03:20.541 --> 03:22.301
Depends who it is.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.938
Fat boy. Carl.

03:23.973 --> 03:25.506
What? Why?

03:25.541 --> 03:27.821
Mark, Dad. You remember him, yeah?
Yeah, I know, but...

03:27.856 --> 03:30.706
Jason, you're looking a bit thin, darl.

03:30.741 --> 03:33.021
Ah, what can I say, Mum, huh?
Missed your cooking.

03:33.056 --> 03:34.426
None for me.

03:34.461 --> 03:35.746
Jase, can you, er?

03:35.781 --> 03:38.861
Your arthritis playing up?
Yep. Can't work, can't wank.

03:38.896 --> 03:40.746
Oh, you shut up, you grumpy old man.

03:40.781 --> 03:44.615
Our boy's back where he belongs.
That's all that matters.

03:46.701 --> 03:49.241
Carl Williams.
Got a lot of mates these days.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.781
Lot of pricks want to work
for his money.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.578
A lot of pricks with guns for hire.

03:53.613 --> 03:55.341
Well, what are we talking about, huh?

03:55.376 --> 03:57.586
What, 30? 40? 50?

03:57.621 --> 04:00.741
At least 200 these days. I haven't
got that sort of money lying around.

04:00.776 --> 04:02.781
That's because you've been
sitting on your arse,

04:02.816 --> 04:04.666
dreaming of your sleepy
bloody retirement.

04:04.701 --> 04:07.101
Look, I know I let the E trade
slip a bit, but...

04:07.136 --> 04:09.226
Slip?
But, jeez, mate, Carl Williams?

04:09.261 --> 04:12.301
Look, we've already dealt with
the prick he paid to do your brother.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.906
I'm not asking the question, Dad.

04:13.941 --> 04:16.797
Fat prick's eaten
his last greasy drumstick.

04:16.832 --> 04:19.654
Yeah, you're probably right...
I am right.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.981
Don't worry, Dad. I'll get
this family back on the map.

04:25.016 --> 04:26.598
Here you are. Look out.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.181
Come on. Where's the ball?

04:28.216 --> 04:29.146
Yes!

04:29.181 --> 04:30.741
Oh! That's for Grandma.

04:30.776 --> 04:32.186
Here we go.

04:32.221 --> 04:34.621
Oh, very well caught.
Good hands, good hands.

04:34.656 --> 04:36.301
Someone's happy to be home.

04:36.336 --> 04:37.781
Oh, he hated London.

04:37.816 --> 04:38.786
Ready?

04:38.821 --> 04:41.381
What about you?
Pleased you've come back?

04:41.416 --> 04:43.941
I wasn't going to get a tan there, was I?

04:43.976 --> 04:44.946
Ready?

04:44.981 --> 04:46.946
He's back?

04:46.981 --> 04:49.186
I could truly puke.

04:49.221 --> 04:50.981
He's still laughing at you, Carl.

04:51.016 --> 04:52.414
All over his ugly rat face.

04:53.901 --> 04:56.306
Tell him, Benj.

04:56.341 --> 04:58.421
Jason Moran has got
an ugly rat face.

04:58.456 --> 05:00.066
I'm wasting my fucking breath.

05:00.101 --> 05:02.331
Oi, bitch, come on.
Let's get a slushy.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.978
Can you do it, Benj?

05:09.581 --> 05:11.014
Jason?

05:12.061 --> 05:13.506
It's a big ask.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.421
Money's not a problem.
You know that.

05:15.456 --> 05:16.854
He's being careful.

05:17.981 --> 05:19.466
Like really, really careful.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.906
So we get him where we can get him -
when he's alone.

05:21.941 --> 05:25.381
He's not gonna turn up for a meeting
with me or you, that's for sure.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.741
Well, who's he gonna turn up for?
Munster?

05:27.776 --> 05:29.706
Nope.

05:29.741 --> 05:32.341
The only guy he's never
gonna tell to piss off is Mick.

05:32.376 --> 05:33.826
Want me to ask him?

05:33.861 --> 05:36.181
Nah, then he'll know
you're working for me, but.

05:36.216 --> 05:37.541
Does already.

05:39.741 --> 05:41.441
Oh, he's Lewis Moran's mate.

05:41.476 --> 05:43.463
Doesn't like Jason much, though.

05:43.498 --> 05:45.450
I don't know. It's a bit too risky.

05:47.901 --> 05:50.901
Carl, how much do you want it?

05:50.936 --> 05:52.386
I want it.

05:52.421 --> 05:56.130
I want a hole in his head
the size I could put my fist through.

05:57.501 --> 05:59.861
I want to see his brains
splattered on the footpath

05:59.896 --> 06:01.419
with pigeons crapping in them.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.891
Mate, Jason hasn't got
that much brains.

06:09.541 --> 06:11.981
Alright. Catch ya later.

06:12.016 --> 06:13.581
Ah, shit.

06:13.616 --> 06:15.398
Hey!

06:15.433 --> 06:17.146
Hey.

06:17.181 --> 06:19.381
It's pretty simple.
Don't touch the fucking car.

06:19.416 --> 06:22.461
Just open the boot, Benji.

06:24.421 --> 06:25.820
Alright.

06:29.701 --> 06:31.501
What have we got here?

06:31.536 --> 06:33.890
Weapons or drugs?

06:36.861 --> 06:38.786
Ooh!

06:38.821 --> 06:41.654
For my mum. She makes
a beautiful sauce.

06:42.701 --> 06:44.578
Wanna come round for dinner?

06:50.301 --> 06:53.532
Oh, well. Looks like you're
gonna have to buy some more, mate.

06:58.941 --> 07:02.301
I was wondering if you could set up
a meeting with someone for me.

07:02.336 --> 07:03.786
Who?

07:03.821 --> 07:05.413
Jason Moran.

07:07.701 --> 07:11.181
Was this the kind of meeting
that you get home for dinner from?

07:11.216 --> 07:13.026
You really are a monster,
aren't you?

07:13.061 --> 07:14.881
Just doing my job
like everybody else, Mick.

07:14.916 --> 07:16.701
The only thing that you do
like everyone else

07:16.736 --> 07:18.226
is what you push out your arse.

07:18.261 --> 07:20.146
Now, I don't get into
that kind of shit.

07:20.181 --> 07:22.821
You want to be careful what
that friend of yours gets up to.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.421
Jason shot him in the guts.
He's still pissed off.

07:25.456 --> 07:27.621
What, you shoot me, I shoot you?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.054
Hey, Mick...

07:30.381 --> 07:32.221
<i>... it could end everything right here.</i>

07:32.256 --> 07:34.212
Right here.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.146
Not my cup of tea, Andrew.

07:38.181 --> 07:40.186
I don't give a shit about Jason.

07:40.221 --> 07:42.306
But his father and I go back
a long way.

07:42.341 --> 07:45.341
I respect that, Mick.
I just thought I'd ask.

07:45.376 --> 07:47.706
Oh.

07:47.741 --> 07:49.174
I'm glad you did.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.054
Fucking kidding me.

07:56.181 --> 07:58.506
What?
Benji.

07:58.541 --> 08:00.941
We were just a little concerned
for your safety, mate,

08:00.976 --> 08:03.341
so we thought it best
if we just kept an eye on you.

08:03.376 --> 08:04.746
Every day.

08:04.781 --> 08:07.741
You might like to think about
getting yourself a proper job.

08:07.776 --> 08:11.021
Or even enrolling
in a TAFE course, maybe.

08:11.056 --> 08:12.661
Fuck-all they can teach me at TAFE.

08:12.696 --> 08:14.941
Get out of my fucking way.

08:14.976 --> 08:17.078
Oh, yeah.

08:17.113 --> 08:19.181
That's good.

08:19.216 --> 08:20.626
Oh.

08:20.661 --> 08:22.866
Oh, yeah.

08:22.901 --> 08:25.661
Little bit deeper.

08:25.696 --> 08:27.346
More tongue.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.061
More tongue. Oh, yeah.

08:29.096 --> 08:30.621
Oh, that's good.

08:30.656 --> 08:32.066
Oh!

08:32.101 --> 08:33.546
Oh, yeah.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.061
Slow it down a little bit.

08:35.096 --> 08:36.546
Oh, Jesus Christ!

08:36.581 --> 08:39.221
What, can't I even get
my dick sucked?

08:39.256 --> 08:41.861
What, you want to have a go, do ya?

08:41.895 --> 08:44.853
Oh, you too? Wanna have a go?

08:47.421 --> 08:49.221
Come here, babe.

08:49.256 --> 08:51.021
Oh, yeah, that's it.

08:51.056 --> 08:52.454
Faster now.

08:54.061 --> 08:55.546
So, what's the hold-up?

08:55.581 --> 08:57.986
Hold-up? I'll tell you what
the fucking hold-up is, alright?

08:58.021 --> 09:02.061
I can't take a shit without that
prick Owen looking over the cubicle.

09:02.096 --> 09:04.973
Think they've bugged my house too,
the arseholes.

09:06.181 --> 09:07.746
You'd better lie low, then, eh?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.981
No, it's alright, mate.
I'm up for it.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.573
Just give me a few days.

09:13.501 --> 09:15.457
Just wait till the heat dies down,
that's all.

09:19.061 --> 09:21.541
Hey, Carl. Come on, I'm telling you.

09:21.576 --> 09:24.021
I would do anything for you, alright?

09:24.056 --> 09:26.386
Hey, it's OK, mate.

09:26.421 --> 09:28.337
Don't worry. I got it sorted.

09:28.372 --> 09:30.253
What, you got someone else?

09:31.821 --> 09:33.698
Nah, shit. What, you're kidding me!

09:34.941 --> 09:37.501
That prick belongs
in a fucking sheltered workshop.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.253
Gets the job done, mate.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.373
# Whoa!

09:48.741 --> 09:50.626
# They're all around you

09:50.661 --> 09:52.861
# There's nowhere to hide... #

09:54.661 --> 09:56.226
# They try to destroy you

09:56.261 --> 09:58.980
# Seeking out a date and time... #

10:00.901 --> 10:02.386
Hey, mate.

10:02.421 --> 10:03.986
Still keeping in shape, mate?

10:04.021 --> 10:05.901
You know how it is -
your body's a temple.

10:05.936 --> 10:08.101
Interested in a job?

10:08.136 --> 10:10.266
How much?

10:10.301 --> 10:12.301
Alright, so what do you want me
to do, then?

10:12.336 --> 10:13.826
Stab him, drown him,
poison him - what?

10:13.861 --> 10:15.981
I'd probably keep it simple.
Simple, yeah? Yeah, good.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.038
So shooting him probably best, then?

10:18.073 --> 10:20.061
Sure. If that's what
you think's good.

10:20.096 --> 10:21.706
That's Moran's address.

10:21.741 --> 10:24.501
Drives a black Merc
and a Ford Spectra.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.986
Oh, babe!

10:26.021 --> 10:27.621
Have you met my slag of a sister?

10:27.656 --> 10:29.381
Oh, you can talk, ya moll.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.038
Yeah, sit down.

10:31.073 --> 10:32.661
I'm Mishy.
Hi.

10:32.696 --> 10:33.626
Chicken?

10:33.661 --> 10:35.741
No, no, no...
He's a vegie head.

10:35.776 --> 10:37.186
Yeah.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.841
A vegetarian?
Yep.

10:38.876 --> 10:40.426
You're kidding.

10:40.461 --> 10:42.101
Full of hormones, preservatives, meat.

10:42.136 --> 10:43.626
No good for ya.

10:43.661 --> 10:45.381
How do you make a hormone?

10:45.416 --> 10:47.181
Refuse to pay her.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.346
Health nut, are ya?

10:53.381 --> 10:55.661
Yeah, I like to stay active.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.458
Don't we all?

10:57.493 --> 10:59.096
Chips OK, but?

10:59.131 --> 11:00.700
Yeah, sure.

11:06.221 --> 11:07.939
They're good.
Yeah.

11:13.301 --> 11:15.506
Mick.

11:15.541 --> 11:16.894
Lewis.
Hey.

11:19.741 --> 11:20.706
Herbert.

11:20.741 --> 11:23.626
Is, er, Graham about?

11:23.661 --> 11:26.981
Munster? No, his, er...
his dog's sick.

11:27.016 --> 11:28.786
He's at the vet. Why?

11:28.821 --> 11:31.541
Oh, I was supposed to meet him here
to play cards.

11:31.576 --> 11:33.026
Could've called me.

11:33.061 --> 11:34.661
Righto, Bertie, let's go to the pub.

11:34.696 --> 11:36.413
Lewis, er...

11:37.541 --> 11:39.421
...how's Jason settling back in?

11:39.456 --> 11:41.158
Good?
Yeah, good. Yeah.

11:41.193 --> 11:42.826
So, what's he up to?

11:42.861 --> 11:45.581
Pretty much running things.
Looking out for his old man.

11:45.616 --> 11:47.226
As all good sons should, hmm?

11:47.261 --> 11:50.741
Pretty soon I'll be sitting here
with my feet up, like you blokes.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.379
There's always a seat for you here.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.380
Yeah.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.541
Going with anyone?

12:24.576 --> 12:26.106
Pat Barbaro.

12:26.141 --> 12:28.939
Make sure one of you
stays sober, OK?

12:30.381 --> 12:31.906
Auskick's at 8:30, right?

12:31.941 --> 12:34.461
Mm-hm. You're picking up
Antonella's kids too.

12:34.496 --> 12:35.894
Yeah.

12:38.461 --> 12:40.531
Hey, Jase.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.499
Don't forget, OK?

12:44.534 --> 12:46.537
Not for quids.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.466
Jason.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.741
Welcome back, mate. Drink?

13:29.776 --> 13:31.666
Willie.

13:31.701 --> 13:33.146
I'll have a Scotch.

13:33.181 --> 13:35.781
Better get a Pimm's
for my, er, girlfriend here.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.419
Two Scotches, Willie.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.381
Willie, I seem to remember
that you owe me about, er...

13:41.416 --> 13:42.814
<i>... what is it, about 50 grand?</i>

13:44.301 --> 13:45.746
Well, yeah.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.341
Didn't know where you were, did I?

13:47.376 --> 13:49.341
I'm back, that's where I am.

13:49.376 --> 13:51.181
And I need it.

13:51.216 --> 13:52.678
Now.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.106
Now?

13:54.141 --> 13:58.061
Jase, mate, I'm gonna pay,
but I don't have it NOW now.

13:58.096 --> 13:59.733
Hey, look, um...

14:00.861 --> 14:02.581
<i>... I've got a good line of chemicals.</i>

14:02.616 --> 14:05.026
Pseud, PTP.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.301
Enough to make a mountain of eccies.

14:07.336 --> 14:09.506
That's good. That's good.

14:09.541 --> 14:11.054
I reckon we'll give you
some business.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.101
But first, I need my cash.

14:14.136 --> 14:15.534
Got a big job on.

14:16.821 --> 14:20.261
Mate, we've all owed each other dosh
at one time and another.

14:20.296 --> 14:23.219
I owed you money,
but you pissed off.

14:33.821 --> 14:35.573
Next week.

14:37.781 --> 14:39.621
And I'll have another Scotch.

14:41.421 --> 14:44.219
Jase...

14:52.301 --> 14:54.021
Phew!

14:55.501 --> 14:57.261
Shit, I can't find the hole.

14:58.741 --> 15:01.021
Bet you Trish has heard
that one before.

15:02.821 --> 15:05.461
Oh! No, I'm serious,
I can't find the hole.

15:05.496 --> 15:07.186
Fucking... Music.

15:07.221 --> 15:11.346
Hi-5, Jase.
Didn't take you as a fan.

15:11.381 --> 15:13.781
Hey, hey, hey. The blonde's rootable.
Check it out.

15:16.141 --> 15:17.620
Fuck!

15:23.701 --> 15:25.300
Who was that?

15:25.335 --> 15:26.899
Sonofabitch!

15:29.101 --> 15:31.331
Fat boy Carl Williams -
that's who it was.

15:32.861 --> 15:36.581
Look at this, huh?
Look what he did to my car. Fuck!

15:36.616 --> 15:38.146
Well, you could
have been killed, Jase.

15:38.181 --> 15:39.986
I'm gonna kill every single one
of these fuckers.

15:40.021 --> 15:42.661
Easy, boy. Jeez, it's not like
the old days, is it, Bertie?

15:42.696 --> 15:44.461
No, the only difference
is you've gotten older

15:44.496 --> 15:46.118
and you've lost your balls.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.706
We used to run this town, yeah?

15:47.741 --> 15:49.426
Let's sort this
little cocksucker out.

15:49.461 --> 15:52.181
Easy, boy. You stick your head up,
you'll get it shot off!

15:52.216 --> 15:54.198
Yeah, shot right off.
You mark my words.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.146
Bertie, shut up, you silly old prick.

15:56.181 --> 15:58.341
No call to be rude
to your betters, Jason.

15:58.376 --> 16:00.621
Come here.
What?

16:00.656 --> 16:03.026
Bloody hell.

16:03.061 --> 16:05.541
What is it? What, you think
I can't take care of myself?

16:05.576 --> 16:07.746
Is that it? Huh?
Or do you think I'm afraid?

16:07.781 --> 16:10.181
Let me tell you, I'm not
chicken shit, like some people.

16:10.216 --> 16:11.986
Just watch your mouth.

16:12.021 --> 16:14.901
And I don't want you going
anywhere alone, alright? Paddy!

16:14.936 --> 16:17.061
Watch his back, alright?
No worries, Lewis.

16:17.096 --> 16:18.626
Gotta go through me first.

16:18.661 --> 16:20.501
When will you stop
treating me like a kid?

16:20.536 --> 16:22.901
What are you guys gasbagging about?

16:22.936 --> 16:24.226
Nothing.

16:24.261 --> 16:26.506
Hey, come on, kids. Give us the ball!

16:26.541 --> 16:29.061
Oh, nice. On the chest,
on the chest. There we go.

16:29.096 --> 16:30.741
Come on. Again.
Come on. Let's go.

16:30.776 --> 16:32.174
Here you go. Whoop!

16:43.341 --> 16:44.826
You did what?

16:44.861 --> 16:47.781
Well, we were following him around,
checking his movements out,

16:47.816 --> 16:50.341
and then... it was just so quiet,
there was no-one around.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.786
I just thought, "Bugger it.

16:51.821 --> 16:53.626
"Why don't I just do it now?
Here? Now?"

16:53.661 --> 16:55.901
He could have seen ya.
He could have recognised your car.

16:55.936 --> 16:58.101
No chance, mate.
We got us the best wheels ever.

16:58.136 --> 17:00.438
An XR8 Ford?

17:00.473 --> 17:02.706
A Magna Verada.

17:02.741 --> 17:05.861
10 million of 'em in Melbourne.
I could have been the parish priest.

17:05.896 --> 17:07.786
I want you to do this clean.

17:07.820 --> 17:11.201
I don't want all of Carlton
gunning for me.

17:11.236 --> 17:14.580
Hey, is it true you and Mishy
are shacking up?

17:14.616 --> 17:16.266
Yeah. Bloody oath!

17:16.300 --> 17:17.981
You're mad. She's a complete slut.

17:18.016 --> 17:19.699
Beauty!

17:24.661 --> 17:26.665
You know,

17:26.701 --> 17:29.941
I always wondered why they never
touched you after you did Mark.

17:29.976 --> 17:31.852
Didn't think I did it, mate.

17:33.181 --> 17:34.781
Didn't think I had it in me.

17:34.816 --> 17:36.419
Really?

17:38.141 --> 17:41.266
Don't worry, Carl. I got a new plan.

17:41.301 --> 17:44.221
I'm gonna get up nice, close
and personal and then... bam!

17:44.256 --> 17:47.258
Eh, Moran's gonna be
pushing up dahlias.

17:47.293 --> 17:50.226
Daisies. He'll be
pushing up daisies.

17:50.261 --> 17:52.461
No, no. See, my grandaddy
used to grow dahlias.

17:52.496 --> 17:55.339
Yep, very, very pretty flower,
that one.

18:04.061 --> 18:07.690
Come on. Up and at 'em, kids.
Get in there! Get in there!

18:09.581 --> 18:11.601
Ooh, good on ya, Bertie.
Cheers, Bertie. Cheers.

18:11.636 --> 18:13.586
On your chest! On your chest!
On your chest!

18:13.621 --> 18:16.461
Oh, you're not gonna believe it.
I'm out of change.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.141
I'll fix you up later.
Yep.

18:18.176 --> 18:20.906
Come on!

18:20.941 --> 18:22.466
Hey, Jase, I've been thinking.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.541
You should get another gun,
carry a double.

18:24.576 --> 18:26.958
Yeah, blow Carl's cock off twice.

18:26.993 --> 18:29.147
You're still gonna do that, are you?

18:29.182 --> 18:31.361
Just getting the money together.
Right.

18:31.396 --> 18:33.506
Be frying fatso by
the end of this season.

18:33.541 --> 18:36.421
You can't do it. Need to get someone
else. Who are you gonna get?

18:36.456 --> 18:38.826
I don't know yet.

18:38.861 --> 18:41.841
Another thing, you should move out.

18:41.876 --> 18:44.821
Ball! Ball! You are shit, umpire!

18:44.856 --> 18:47.306
Shit! Get the little runt!

18:47.341 --> 18:49.341
Are you listening to me?
You've been shot at!

18:49.376 --> 18:51.301
Come on, kick it! Kick it!

18:51.336 --> 18:52.861
Go in hard! Kick it!

18:52.896 --> 18:54.586
Ha ha! Yes!

18:54.621 --> 18:57.089
Straight up 'em, son.

19:03.661 --> 19:06.581
The kids think it's Christmas,
spending time with their big cousins.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.426
So nice having you guys back home.

19:08.461 --> 19:10.497
Got a bit Ionely
when youse were away.

19:14.861 --> 19:17.581
Hey. Hey, come here.

19:17.616 --> 19:20.301
I miss him so much.

19:20.336 --> 19:22.106
Oh, we all do.

19:22.141 --> 19:25.101
Kids shouldn't have to grow up
without their father. God.

19:25.136 --> 19:26.946
Hey, whoever it was,

19:26.981 --> 19:28.941
they'll rot in hell, don't you worry.

19:28.976 --> 19:31.278
How come you're so strong, Trisha?

19:31.313 --> 19:33.581
I'm a hard bitch, aren't I, Jase?

19:33.616 --> 19:37.221
49% bitch, 51 % sweetheart.

19:37.256 --> 19:38.738
See you later. See ya.

19:38.773 --> 19:40.213
See ya.
See you, kids.

19:40.248 --> 19:41.654
'Bye, Dad.
'Bye, Jase.

19:42.901 --> 19:45.661
Mark would be so chuffed
he takes them to footy every week.

19:45.696 --> 19:47.586
Ah, he loves it, big bloody kid.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.693
Enjoys it more than they do.
You're so lucky, Trisha.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.786
You keep insisting on eating here,

19:57.821 --> 20:01.701
you're gonna end up with an arse
the size of a fucking elephant's.

20:01.736 --> 20:04.034
Swear I'm the best
fucking mother in the world,

20:04.069 --> 20:06.332
the amount of money
I fucking spend on you.

20:08.501 --> 20:11.541
Hello, Patricia.
What do you want?

20:11.576 --> 20:12.986
It's an amazing coincidence,

20:13.021 --> 20:15.181
our children going to
the same school, isn't it?

20:15.216 --> 20:16.978
I'm surprised you can afford it.

20:17.013 --> 20:18.797
You always were an up-yourself cow.

20:18.832 --> 20:20.546
And you'll always be a scrubber.

20:20.581 --> 20:23.241
Fucking Morans.
You think you're shit hot.

20:23.276 --> 20:25.901
But your husband is
a floppy-dicked prick ball

20:25.936 --> 20:27.626
who treats everyone like crap.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.261
But he's gonna get his
one of these days, the fucking poser.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.694
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.539
Fuck off.

20:45.901 --> 20:48.626
Fucking... Why didn't you...
Fucking sonofa...

20:48.661 --> 20:50.961
Don't do it. Don't do it.
Mark told me to kill him.

20:50.996 --> 20:53.261
I should have listened.
I should have finished him off.

20:53.296 --> 20:54.706
Mate! Don't do it.
No, no.

20:54.741 --> 20:56.981
Every second this prick's alive
is an insult to his memory.

20:57.016 --> 20:59.301
But you can't do it...
He's too big for his boots.

20:59.336 --> 21:00.746
He's gotta be stopped.
No! No!

21:00.781 --> 21:03.821
Mate, are you listening to me?
Slut of a wife has a go at mine.

21:03.856 --> 21:06.101
Who does he think he is?
Trish can handle herself. Hey!

21:06.136 --> 21:08.740
Hey, how's you going to prison
gonna help her any?

21:09.981 --> 21:11.414
Jason...

21:13.581 --> 21:15.106
Alright.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.816
Alright, if you're gonna do it,
do it properly.

21:20.141 --> 21:22.141
Be patient. Don't risk everything.

21:22.176 --> 21:24.106
If you need extra dosh, well...

21:24.141 --> 21:26.097
...well, I can come back
into the business.

21:28.861 --> 21:30.946
You can't even unzip your fly.
Piss off, will you?

21:30.981 --> 21:33.221
I've been doing this crap
since you were crapping your pants.

21:33.256 --> 21:35.186
I can do pick-ups, drop-offs.

21:35.221 --> 21:38.531
I'll pull me weight,
don't you worry about it.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.531
Alright. Alright, alright.

21:45.541 --> 21:48.141
You, uh, locked all your windows?
Yeah.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.386
Doors?
Yeah. Yeah.

21:50.421 --> 21:52.781
Well, come on, then.
What?

21:52.816 --> 21:55.141
Let's check them again.

21:55.176 --> 21:56.699
Oh, Jesus.

22:04.701 --> 22:07.781
# I have no other way

22:07.816 --> 22:10.258
# There is a price to pay

22:10.293 --> 22:12.666
# For what the man will say

22:12.701 --> 22:16.221
# That I was a million miles away

22:16.256 --> 22:18.758
# In a promise full of steam

22:18.793 --> 22:21.747
# It could take no vacant dream

22:21.782 --> 22:24.501
# To persuade me to believe

22:24.536 --> 22:27.138
# I think, just don't fight it

22:27.173 --> 22:29.937
# Don't fight it
Don't fight it

22:29.972 --> 22:33.056
# If you don't know what it is

22:33.091 --> 22:35.636
# If you don't know
what it is

22:35.671 --> 22:38.026
# I think, just don't fight it

22:38.061 --> 22:40.761
# Don't fight it
Don't fight it

22:40.796 --> 22:43.426
# If you don't know what it is

22:43.461 --> 22:47.010
# If you don't know what it is... #

22:49.861 --> 22:52.626
We knew Jason
was building up a war chest.

22:52.661 --> 22:56.561
We assumed he was financing a hit
on his archenemy, Carl Williams.

22:56.596 --> 23:00.461
What we didn't know was when,
where or how it was going to happen.

23:00.496 --> 23:02.746
All we could do was watch and wait.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.578
Do I look stupid?
Give me the fucking money.

23:05.941 --> 23:07.499
Get out of here, you...

23:08.901 --> 23:11.186
# I left my heart in places

23:11.221 --> 23:14.186
# Forgot every one of their faces

23:14.221 --> 23:17.421
# And tried to navigate
a broken path... #

23:17.456 --> 23:19.078
OK, kids. Go on, let's go.

23:19.113 --> 23:20.701
# I may have helped create

23:20.736 --> 23:22.626
# In any incident

23:22.661 --> 23:25.221
# This is never no accident

23:25.256 --> 23:27.266
# To stand alone... #

23:27.301 --> 23:29.661
You're right to get over there.
Who's kicking a goal today?

23:29.696 --> 23:31.426
Me. Me.
Me! Me!

23:31.461 --> 23:33.541
Yeah, yeah? Alright.
Check your boots...

23:33.576 --> 23:35.558
# Ah, give it up

23:35.593 --> 23:37.541
# Those dirty tricks

23:37.576 --> 23:40.218
# No quick fix

23:40.253 --> 23:42.797
# Can undo it

23:42.832 --> 23:45.686
# Ah, give it up

23:45.721 --> 23:48.506
# I won't resist

23:48.541 --> 23:51.221
# Well, my answer's always this

23:51.256 --> 23:53.026
# I said don't fight it

23:53.061 --> 23:55.541
# Don't fight it
Don't fight it

23:55.576 --> 23:57.986
# If you don't know what it is

23:58.021 --> 24:01.226
# If you don't know
what it is... #

24:01.261 --> 24:03.801
Come on, Bertie.
What's your problem? Move your arse.

24:03.836 --> 24:06.341
Well, this stuff weighs a ton.
Yeah? Did you count it?

24:06.376 --> 24:09.038
Yeah. 500 bags, 1,000 each.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.666
Good-o. Beer o'clock, I reckon.

24:11.701 --> 24:14.306
Tell me, did you ever drop
one of these, then?

24:14.341 --> 24:17.381
Eccies? Yeah. Played havoc
with me angina medication.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.026
My whole life flashed
before me eyes.

24:19.061 --> 24:21.581
How about you?
Nah, the missus would cut up...

24:21.616 --> 24:23.146
Hey, Lewis!

24:23.181 --> 24:24.721
Jesus! Run for it!

24:24.756 --> 24:26.261
Police. Don't move!

24:39.981 --> 24:42.066
Oh, fuck it.

24:42.101 --> 24:44.426
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:44.461 --> 24:46.441
Lewis Moran and his mate Bertie

24:46.476 --> 24:48.386
were remanded into custody,

24:48.421 --> 24:51.506
which meant Jason had two fewer
pairs of eyes watching his back.

24:51.541 --> 24:54.461
Well, mate, the only place I've seen
him more than once is junior footy.

24:54.496 --> 24:57.261
He takes a bunch of kids out to
Pascoe Vale every Saturday morning.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.626
I could have told you that.
Hey.

24:59.661 --> 25:02.481
Is he alone?
Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes not.

25:02.516 --> 25:05.266
What's wrong with doing it there?
Exactly.

25:05.301 --> 25:07.981
There's all these kids there, plus
a couple of hundred other people.

25:08.016 --> 25:09.946
Plus, it's on Moonee Ponds road -
nowhere to park.

25:09.981 --> 25:12.981
Why is this one so fucking hard
to get? Someone tell me that.

25:13.016 --> 25:15.061
They're all hard, Carl.
You should know that.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.786
Hey, I thought

25:16.821 --> 25:19.741
maybe I could do it like
in 'The Day of the Jackal'.

25:19.776 --> 25:21.186
What?
The Jackal.

25:21.221 --> 25:23.861
He disguises himself as this
old bloke to get past security,

25:23.896 --> 25:26.178
so he can pop off the king
or the president...

25:26.213 --> 25:28.461
You want to dress up
as an old man to get Jason?

25:28.496 --> 25:30.661
No, no, no. An old lady.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.106
An old lady?
Yeah.

25:32.141 --> 25:34.621
Have my shotty in one of them
carts they take to market.

25:34.656 --> 25:36.066
Pop him in a nightclub.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.706
Won't people think it's a bit weird

25:37.741 --> 25:39.906
when some old dear
walks into a nightclub,

25:39.941 --> 25:43.301
pulls a shotty out of a shopping cart
and then blows a guy away?

25:43.336 --> 25:45.741
I'll wear a balaclava.
You'll wear a balaclava?

25:45.776 --> 25:47.741
What the bloody hell are you...

25:47.776 --> 25:50.106
Ah, Jesus.

25:50.141 --> 25:52.546
I'm only kidding, mate.

25:52.581 --> 25:57.257
Just want the clam dead, alright?
Nothing fancy, just dead.

25:59.541 --> 26:01.981
Do it at the oval.
Yeah?

26:02.016 --> 26:04.421
What about all them kids?

26:04.456 --> 26:06.252
They'll get over it.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.746
If the resources
had been available,

26:19.781 --> 26:22.301
we'd have kept every single one
of Carl's associates

26:22.336 --> 26:24.398
under 24-hour surveillance.

26:24.433 --> 26:26.426
But we had to prioritise.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.501
Tailing Benji was a no-brainer.

26:28.536 --> 26:30.638
He'd murdered for fat boy before.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.741
How could we ignore him? We couldn't.

26:32.776 --> 26:35.506
And Carl was counting on it.

26:35.541 --> 26:38.180
He was way ahead of us, as per usual.

26:54.301 --> 26:56.106
Jason.

26:56.141 --> 26:57.574
Just a sec.

27:05.141 --> 27:07.257
Come in.

27:08.821 --> 27:11.021
It's your dad, as per.

27:11.056 --> 27:12.534
Thanks.

27:14.421 --> 27:15.866
Hi, Dad.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.821
Have you, uh...
Yes, I've done it.

27:18.856 --> 27:21.706
You doing it every night?
Yes.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.826
Yes, I'm doing it every bloody night.

27:23.861 --> 27:27.261
What, are they slipping old lady
hormones in your tea in there, huh?

27:27.296 --> 27:29.101
Just check they're
all locked, alright?

27:29.136 --> 27:30.786
Just check them for me.

27:30.821 --> 27:33.494
Yeah, alright, mate. Just for you.

29:02.981 --> 29:05.758
# Hide and seek

29:05.793 --> 29:08.536
# Is the game

29:11.741 --> 29:14.641
# We'll teach you

29:14.676 --> 29:17.541
# How to play... #

29:19.501 --> 29:22.095
# Close your eyes

29:23.941 --> 29:26.819
# Really tight

29:28.301 --> 29:30.815
# Make it dark

29:32.301 --> 29:35.418
# Like the night

29:38.621 --> 29:41.061
# The party never ends

29:41.096 --> 29:43.598
# The game begins again

29:43.633 --> 29:46.047
# The party never ends

29:46.082 --> 29:48.271
# The game begins again

29:48.306 --> 29:50.461
# The party never ends... #

29:50.496 --> 29:52.786
Well done. Well done.

29:52.821 --> 29:56.506
# The party never ends
The game begins again... #

29:56.541 --> 29:59.658
What do you reckon we get home,
get some ice-cream on the way?

30:10.301 --> 30:11.450
Seatbelts?

30:14.421 --> 30:16.298
Why is that man running, Daddy?

31:03.631 --> 31:06.351
# Who are those children
that are dressed in red?

31:06.386 --> 31:09.231
# 12 gates to the city

31:09.266 --> 31:10.744
# Hallelujah

31:12.391 --> 31:14.427
# Hallelujah

31:15.711 --> 31:18.911
# It must be the children
that Moses led

31:18.946 --> 31:21.671
# 12 gates to the city

31:21.706 --> 31:23.662
# Hallelujah

31:25.151 --> 31:27.187
# Hallelujah

31:41.191 --> 31:44.351
# My God did just what He said

31:44.386 --> 31:47.071
# 12 gates to the city

31:47.106 --> 31:49.062
# Hallelujah

31:50.191 --> 31:52.386
# Hallelujah

31:53.911 --> 31:57.111
# Heal the sick and raise the dead

31:57.146 --> 31:59.671
# 12 gates to the city

31:59.706 --> 32:02.060
# Hallelujah

32:03.111 --> 32:05.306
# Hallelujah... #

32:13.391 --> 32:17.411
Witnesses say the masked gunman
ran through the crowded car park

32:17.446 --> 32:21.431
up to the van where his target sat
with four children in the back.

32:21.466 --> 32:24.671
They had just attended
an Auskick clinic.

32:24.706 --> 32:26.311
Police have yet to confirm...

32:26.346 --> 32:27.796
Carl, come here!

32:27.831 --> 32:29.691
...these murders are part of
an emerging war...

32:29.726 --> 32:31.551
<i>Quick!
... in Melbourne's criminal underworld.</i>

32:31.586 --> 32:33.271
It's understood at least...

32:33.306 --> 32:35.316
He's dead.

32:35.351 --> 32:38.271
He's fucking dead.
Jason is finally fucking dead.

32:38.306 --> 32:39.796
I can't believe it.

32:39.831 --> 32:41.531
Well, believe it, baby, believe it.

32:41.566 --> 32:43.231
Believe it, believe it, believe it.

32:44.551 --> 32:46.036
...deeply shocked and outraged.

32:46.071 --> 32:48.031
Counselling will be offered
to bystanders...

32:48.066 --> 32:49.511
Shit, I wonder if Tony knows.

32:49.546 --> 32:50.956
I'm partying tonight.

32:50.991 --> 32:54.911
Detective Inspector Todd McDonald
of the Purana Task Force

32:54.946 --> 32:56.788
has urged anybody...

32:59.111 --> 33:01.551
Jason Moran
was a cocksucking clown...

33:05.511 --> 33:07.706
The fucking clown deserved it.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.556
Shut up!

33:14.591 --> 33:16.422
Shut up! Have a bit of respect!

33:17.831 --> 33:20.391
Lewis, I'm here, mate.

33:20.426 --> 33:21.870
I'm here!

33:32.791 --> 33:34.224
OK.

33:37.871 --> 33:39.836
Yeah. No, that'd be fine.

33:39.871 --> 33:42.311
Well, a witness reckons
he sprinted it.

33:42.346 --> 33:43.396
Bullshit. A k?

33:43.431 --> 33:45.871
Mate, I ran it this afternoon.
It's doable if you're fit.

33:45.906 --> 33:47.831
Yeah, Mr Bloody Superhero.
What have you got, mate?

33:47.866 --> 33:49.276
Ladies, that's enough.

33:49.311 --> 33:51.671
Now, what crim do we know
who could sprint a kilometre?

33:51.706 --> 33:52.820
This bloke.

33:54.031 --> 33:56.471
Did a load of bank jobs
back in the '80s and '90s.

33:56.506 --> 33:58.471
He used to park his car
600m to 700m away

33:58.506 --> 34:00.036
and then run to the bank and back.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.671
'The running man' -
that's what we called him.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.151
Find him.
Get on with it.

34:03.186 --> 34:04.356
Garry, more journos.

34:04.391 --> 34:07.111
They're gonna have to wait for the
press conference like everyone else.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.670
Yeah, I'm afraid
he's unavailable at the moment.

34:09.706 --> 34:10.659
Yeah, OK.

34:30.751 --> 34:34.371
Jason's murder was
a huge story right across the country.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.991
Broad daylight, public place,
witnessed by innocent children.

34:38.025 --> 34:39.916
It broke all the codes.

34:39.951 --> 34:43.110
The community looked at the police
for an explanation.

34:43.146 --> 34:45.148
How could we stand by
twiddling our thumbs

34:45.183 --> 34:47.150
when someone had shot a dad
and his mate

34:47.186 --> 34:48.583
at a junior footy clinic?

34:49.630 --> 34:51.063
We'd failed everyone.

35:11.431 --> 35:13.791
What are we celebrating, again, tiger?

35:13.826 --> 35:16.448
Jason Moran's dead.

35:16.483 --> 35:18.517
Really?!

35:18.552 --> 35:20.516
Oh...

35:20.551 --> 35:22.471
Bobbie will be rapt.
Yeah!

35:28.831 --> 35:30.431
You remember the first time
we met, Carl?

35:30.466 --> 35:31.436
Yeah.

35:31.471 --> 35:33.231
You were Jason's bloody driver.

35:38.351 --> 35:39.670
You've come a long way, Carl.

35:43.711 --> 35:46.076
Urggh! Jesus!

35:46.111 --> 35:47.908
Get a few more of them, eh?
Yeah, yeah.

35:49.271 --> 35:50.276
Jesus.

35:50.311 --> 35:52.745
Benji's not taking advantage
of the situation, is he?

35:53.791 --> 35:55.351
Nah, nah, he's alright.

35:55.386 --> 35:56.831
Hey, Bobbie!

35:56.866 --> 35:58.276
Yeah?

35:58.311 --> 35:59.756
What do you think of this place?

35:59.791 --> 36:02.316
It's fucking Fuckingham Palace. Whoo!

36:02.351 --> 36:03.951
You wanna have
Dhakota's christening here?

36:03.986 --> 36:05.667
Yeah!
Fucking...

36:05.702 --> 36:07.349
Yeah, fuck... Yeah.

36:15.271 --> 36:17.705
Hey.
Hey. Hey.

36:18.951 --> 36:20.471
What time is it?

36:20.506 --> 36:21.756
It's late.

36:21.791 --> 36:24.431
I know you're busy - I just thought
I'd get you something to eat,

36:24.466 --> 36:25.876
bring it in for you.

36:25.911 --> 36:28.551
Oh, thanks, but I think
I'll just, um, call it quits, eh?

36:28.586 --> 36:29.516
Mmm.

36:29.551 --> 36:31.031
One sec. I'll just drop these off.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.464
Yeah, sure.

36:46.911 --> 36:48.663
Oh... Hit the road, eh?

36:49.751 --> 36:50.706
Babe...

36:55.151 --> 36:57.870
I thought it was just another one
of your bloody murders.

36:59.271 --> 37:01.991
But those... I mean,
those little kids, they didn't...

37:02.026 --> 37:03.424
Hey, hey, hey, shh.

37:06.111 --> 37:08.311
I'm gonna get this bloke. OK?

37:08.346 --> 37:09.551
Yep.

37:21.271 --> 37:23.262
Whoo!

37:33.191 --> 37:34.624
OK.

37:40.511 --> 37:41.944
It's OK.

37:57.191 --> 38:00.231
Don't worry, Mummy.
I'll look after you, I promise.

38:13.031 --> 38:14.836
Lewis.

38:14.871 --> 38:16.862
I brought you dinner.

38:19.511 --> 38:21.741
Look, you... you've got to eat.

38:26.591 --> 38:28.916
Mmm. Mmm.

38:28.951 --> 38:31.101
That's really lovely.

38:38.031 --> 38:41.990
I'II... I'll leave it there for ya.
OK. See ya, mate.

39:00.351 --> 39:04.583
# We could lock away
the bad memories together

39:06.791 --> 39:11.626
# Close the doors to the past forever

39:14.551 --> 39:16.860
# Watching you touch

39:17.911 --> 39:20.356
# We're past this much

39:20.391 --> 39:24.031
# And I'm alone with you tonight

39:24.066 --> 39:27.556
# Alone with you tonight

39:27.591 --> 39:34.031
# Alone with you tonight... #

39:34.066 --> 39:36.356
Whoo-hoo!

39:36.391 --> 39:40.623
# I can't always remember what I say

39:42.751 --> 39:47.506
# And I can't always take it
having to pay

39:50.511 --> 39:53.116
# Watching you walk

39:53.151 --> 39:56.631
# You know you're really attractive

39:56.666 --> 39:59.988
# I'm alone with you tonight

40:00.023 --> 40:03.311
# Alone with you tonight... #

40:37.311 --> 40:42.180
# I know it's hard
when you have tried

40:43.831 --> 40:49.906
# When your conversation's terror
you had tied

40:52.231 --> 40:55.251
# Making out you still don't know

40:55.286 --> 40:58.318
# All I have is alcohol
So let me go

40:58.353 --> 41:01.316
# I'm alone with you tonight... #

41:01.351 --> 41:03.011
Dhakota Williams's christening

41:03.046 --> 41:04.636
was really Carl's coronation.

41:04.671 --> 41:07.116
With the destruction
of the Moran boys,

41:07.151 --> 41:09.511
he had become the most powerful
gangster in Melbourne.

41:09.546 --> 41:11.547
The king of the crims.

41:12.751 --> 41:15.725
But if he'd had a crystal ball
that night,

41:15.760 --> 41:18.699
he might not have partied so long
and so hard.
