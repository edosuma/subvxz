Woo-hoo!

01:05.433 --> 01:06.799
I can dig it!

Are you pup paleontologists
prepped for a big dino dig?

01:20.614 --> 01:21.113
Oh, yeah!

01:21.115 --> 01:22.748
I'm ready to shovel...

01:22.750 --> 01:25.384
And dig bones!

01:25.386 --> 01:26.452
Oh, phooey!

01:26.454 --> 01:27.586
Duck!

01:27.588 --> 01:28.554
Waa!

01:28.556 --> 01:29.788
BOTH:
Duck!

01:29.790 --> 01:30.789
Whoa!

01:30.791 --> 01:31.290
Gotcha!

01:31.292 --> 01:31.924
(Chuckling)

01:31.926 --> 01:34.393
(Laughing)

01:34.395 --> 01:37.763
We're not looking for
chew bones or toys.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.831
We want to find fossils-

01:38.833 --> 01:42.267
bones that are so old
they become as hard as rocks.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.368
(Barking)

01:43.370 --> 01:44.937
Looks like we're here.

01:44.939 --> 01:48.340
(Cheering)

01:48.676 --> 01:52.544
All right, let's dig
some dinosaurs!

01:56.750 --> 01:59.251
Ruff, shovel!

02:00.955 --> 02:02.888
(Beeping)

02:02.890 --> 02:05.691
Arf!

02:07.828 --> 02:09.628
(Laughing)

02:09.630 --> 02:10.362
Whoa, slow down.

02:10.364 --> 02:13.665
You might fracture a fossil
with fast and furious flinging.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.667
BOTH:
You got it.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.570
Yeah, like that,
'cause you never know

02:18.572 --> 02:21.807
what treasures
you might dig up.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.308
(Dinging)

02:23.310 --> 02:26.011
Whoa, my shovel hit something!

02:26.013 --> 02:27.312
ALL:
Wow!

02:27.314 --> 02:27.946
Cool!

02:27.948 --> 02:29.348
Exceptional excavation, Rubble!

02:29.350 --> 02:32.918
These are a billion times
better than balls or bones.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.453
They're eggs!

02:34.455 --> 02:36.054
Way to dig, Rubble!

02:36.056 --> 02:36.822
It's what I do.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.758
We should study these
spectacular specimens.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.760
Let's pack them carefully.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.362
(Barking)

02:48.836 --> 02:51.036
(Barking)

02:59.813 --> 03:01.880
Hmm...

03:01.882 --> 03:05.551
RYDER:
Hey, Marshall, can you help us
see what's inside the eggs?

03:05.553 --> 03:07.786
Sure can!
(Barking)

03:07.788 --> 03:08.320
X-ray!

03:12.526 --> 03:15.360
So, what kind of
animal is it?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.762
We need to study it
to be sure,

03:16.764 --> 03:19.665
but Rubble definitely
made a dandy discovery

03:19.667 --> 03:22.434
for the museum's diorama.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.369
Those eggs are amazing!

03:24.371 --> 03:26.905
I bet they're some
kind of pterodactyl.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.474
Or a pup-odactyl!

03:29.476 --> 03:30.943
Squawk!

03:32.646 --> 03:35.647
Roar, roar!

03:35.649 --> 03:37.749
Like a tricera-pup!

03:37.751 --> 03:39.851
Or a scary raptor pup!

03:39.853 --> 03:41.420
Roar!

03:41.422 --> 03:41.954
(Laughing)

03:41.956 --> 03:45.357
We're a tyrannosaurus pup!

03:45.359 --> 03:46.391
Grr!

03:46.393 --> 03:47.893
Whoa, steady, Zuma!

03:47.895 --> 03:48.994
I'm trying!

03:48.996 --> 03:49.628
BOTH:
Whoa!

03:49.630 --> 03:54.933
Marshall, you're
more like a slip-asaurus!

03:54.935 --> 03:56.902
(Laughing)

03:56.904 --> 03:57.436
(Sighing)

03:57.438 --> 03:59.571
Being a dinosaur is tiring.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.808
Time for a prehistoric nap.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.010

04:14.655 --> 04:15.921
Huh?

04:15.923 --> 04:18.724
(Screeching)

04:18.726 --> 04:20.058
What's that?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.827
Whoa!

04:21.829 --> 04:24.096
(Video game beeping)

04:24.098 --> 04:25.631
(Phone ringing)

04:25.633 --> 04:26.164
Ryder here.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.834
<i> Ryder, this is the most</i>
<i> exciting incident in the...</i>

04:28.836 --> 04:30.168
<i> uh, well, infinity!</i>

04:30.170 --> 04:34.973
<i> A flying pterodactyl took off</i>
<i> with my best bait bucket!</i>

04:34.975 --> 04:36.541
(Laughing)

04:36.543 --> 04:37.676
Good one, Cap'n.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.176
<i> No joke!</i>

04:38.178 --> 04:41.146
<i> This was a preposterously</i>
<i> prehistoric pterodactyl!</i>

04:41.148 --> 04:44.816
Pterodactyls have been extinct
for a long, long time.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.884
If there were something
that big around,

04:45.886 --> 04:48.587
the pups or I would've seen it.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.423
(Screeching)

04:53.427 --> 04:54.860
(Banging)

04:54.862 --> 04:56.962
Huh?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.131
Whoa!

04:59.133 --> 05:01.433
That's one big eyeball!

05:01.435 --> 05:02.734

05:14.148 --> 05:15.580
Ryder, you won't believe it!

05:15.582 --> 05:19.551
I saw a giant pterodactyl
flying around the lookout!

05:19.553 --> 05:20.152
I believe it.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.021
I just had a close encounter
of the eyeball kind.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.022
(Screeching)

05:24.024 --> 05:25.857
Huh?
What's that?

05:29.196 --> 05:30.495
Look!

05:30.497 --> 05:33.131
RUBBLE:
A pterodactyl egg!

05:33.133 --> 05:34.099
(Screeching)

05:34.101 --> 05:35.000
And it's mama!

05:35.002 --> 05:36.768
And she's super upset!

05:36.770 --> 05:39.638
Don't worry, pterodactyl mom,
we'll help you.

05:39.640 --> 05:44.009
No egg is too big,
no pup is too small!

05:44.011 --> 05:45.210
(Beeping)

05:45.212 --> 05:47.579
PAW Patrol, to the lookout!

05:47.581 --> 05:49.514

05:49.516 --> 05:50.015

05:53.787 --> 05:55.153
Uh-oh.

05:55.155 --> 05:55.954
Oof!

05:55.956 --> 05:58.090
Whoa, dude!
Whoa!

05:58.092 --> 06:00.959
(Barking)

06:00.961 --> 06:02.627
Whoa!

06:02.629 --> 06:04.896
ALL:
Oof!

06:04.898 --> 06:06.198
Look, it's the hula-saurus!

06:06.200 --> 06:10.035
(Laughing)

06:19.813 --> 06:21.947
(Elevator dinging)

06:24.651 --> 06:27.252
PAW Patrol ready
for action, Ryder, sir!

06:27.254 --> 06:28.854
(Beeping)

06:28.856 --> 06:31.123
Hey, pups, we have
a one-of-a-kind

06:31.125 --> 06:33.225
but amazingly cool
emergency today.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.693
A pterodactyl stole
some fish from Cap'n Turbot,

06:34.695 --> 06:37.129
and made a nest
on the lookout roof.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.930
(Screeching)

06:38.932 --> 06:40.132
I saw her fly up there!

06:40.134 --> 06:42.267
ALL:
Wow!

06:42.269 --> 06:45.303
But the bad news is an egg
rolled out of the nest

06:45.305 --> 06:46.171
and into the bushes.

06:46.173 --> 06:50.642
It's too round and slippery for
the pterodactyl mom to pick up,

06:50.644 --> 06:51.877
so for this mission I'll need...

06:51.879 --> 06:54.679
Skye, you can lift
the egg with your harness

06:54.681 --> 06:55.881
and fly it back up to the nest.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.917
Where the big,
scary, prehistoric

06:58.919 --> 07:00.152
pterodactyl mama lives?

07:00.154 --> 07:03.555
This is tricky, Skye,
but you can handle it.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.924
A pup's gotta do
what a pup's gotta do!

07:05.926 --> 07:10.028
Yipe! And this puppy's
gotta fly!

07:10.030 --> 07:11.863
I may need to distract the mom.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.799
Rubble, I need
you and your shovel

07:13.801 --> 07:16.735
to lift the egg
into Skye's harness.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.869
Rubble on the double!

07:17.871 --> 07:21.273
All right, PAW Patrol

08:18.799 --> 08:20.632
Ryder, I'm heading over
to the...

08:20.634 --> 08:21.933

08:26.673 --> 08:28.173

08:28.175 --> 08:31.910
Roar, roar, megaphone!

08:31.912 --> 08:32.677
<i> Roar!</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:34.312
<i> Leave her alone, roar!</i>

08:34.314 --> 08:36.882
(Screeching)

08:36.884 --> 08:38.316
Thanks, Chase!

08:38.318 --> 08:39.117
That was close.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.054
Okay, let's hurry before
the mom comes back.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.323
I'll just slip this under...

08:45.325 --> 08:48.226
Very, very, very gently...

08:48.228 --> 08:50.362
And--
(Dinging)

08:50.364 --> 08:51.396
(Cracking)

08:51.398 --> 08:52.364
Oh, no!

08:52.366 --> 08:54.799
I was trying not to break it!

08:57.070 --> 08:57.969
ALL:
Aww!

08:57.971 --> 09:00.305
You didn't break it,
the egg hatched!

09:00.307 --> 09:03.308
But, uh, we need to get
the baby back to the nest.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.143
Come on, baby.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.246
Time to take a little
ride back home.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.314
(Chirping)

09:09.316 --> 09:11.449
That's okay, Rubble,
I've got it.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.717
Whoa!

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
That chick's fast.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.454
We need more help
getting him home.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.689

09:25.465 --> 09:26.164
Ah!

09:26.166 --> 09:29.000
Another prehistoric chick?

09:29.002 --> 09:32.270
CHASE:
Ryder, another egg hatched!

09:32.272 --> 09:34.372
We have two babies
to catch!

serious pterodactyl trouble.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.721

a giant pterodactyl?

<i> It is a prehistoric creature,</i>
<i> and it is definitely--</i>

09:58.465 --> 10:02.968
<i> A really, really, really,</i>
<i> really big utahraptor!</i>

10:02.970 --> 10:04.469
<i> Isn't it cool?</i>

10:04.471 --> 10:05.270
RYDER:
Wow, he's huge!

10:05.272 --> 10:08.106
Hang on, we're on our way.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.175
Cool!

10:10.177 --> 10:12.310

10:20.320 --> 10:21.052
Yahoo!

10:21.054 --> 10:22.520
I got my birthday wish!

10:22.522 --> 10:24.322
Nom-nom-nom-nom!

10:33.867 --> 10:35.367
Oh, no!
(Screaming)

10:35.369 --> 10:36.401
Look!

10:36.403 --> 10:38.470
It's a birthday raptor!

10:38.472 --> 10:40.772
(Growling)

10:41.408 --> 10:43.842
Mmm-mmm!

10:49.950 --> 10:53.318
Uh, see you later, alligator.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.285
(Screaming)

10:54.287 --> 10:58.223
What're we gonna do, what're we
gonna do, what're we gonna do?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.425
(Sniffing)

11:04.431 --> 11:06.264
Nom-nom-nom-nom!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.436
(Gargling)

11:13.040 --> 11:16.541
We could use those
for Halloween.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.977
(Laughing)

11:18.979 --> 11:20.879
(Clucking)

11:25.485 --> 11:26.518
(Gasping)

11:26.520 --> 11:27.318
Chickaletta, no!
Oh, dear!

11:27.320 --> 11:29.220
What if that
big dino thingamajig

11:29.222 --> 11:32.123
tries to eat my Chickaletta?

11:32.125 --> 11:32.624
(Beeping)

11:32.626 --> 11:36.528
Ryder, it's a disaster
of ginormous proportions!

11:36.530 --> 11:37.462
Hurry!

11:37.464 --> 11:42.000
<i> Don't worry, Mayor Goodway,</i>
<i> we're on our way.</i>

11:42.002 --> 11:42.534

PAW Patrol, back to the lookout!

11:44.971 --> 11:47.172

11:49.976 --> 11:52.143
RYDER:
We have a serious situation.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.545
I need all paws on deck.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.214
Dinosaurs are taking over
Adventure Bay.

11:56.216 --> 11:56.781
ALL:
Yay!

11:56.783 --> 12:00.685
Skye, Marshall, I need you to
catch the baby pterodactyls.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.455
Arf, let's take to the sky!

12:03.457 --> 12:04.956
I'm fired up!

12:04.958 --> 12:06.357
(Phone ringing)
Ryder here.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.292
<i> Ryder, help!</i>

12:07.294 --> 12:10.462

<i> blocking the tracks!</i>

12:10.464 --> 12:12.330
Ooh, can I help?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.132
Rubble's on his way.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.967
(Beeping)
The rest of you, follow me.

12:15.969 --> 12:20.271
PAW Patrol, time to
tame a utahraptor!

12:20.273 --> 12:23.475

(Siren blaring)

12:30.550 --> 12:41.059

12:41.061 --> 12:43.094
All right, Rubble,
keep me posted.

12:43.096 --> 12:43.695
I can dig it!

12:43.697 --> 12:45.463
(Chirping)

12:45.465 --> 12:48.566
Skye, Marshall,
follow those two.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.335
The rest of you, let's go.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.304
(Barking)

12:58.078 --> 12:59.210
There's the pup I want to see!

12:59.212 --> 13:02.180
Rubble, think you can
move that dinosaur?

13:02.182 --> 13:02.714
Sure can!

13:02.716 --> 13:05.583
Triceratops are
my favourite dinos!

13:05.585 --> 13:07.685
(Roaring)

13:07.687 --> 13:09.721
Whoa, you're loud!

13:09.723 --> 13:12.590
(Stomping)

13:12.592 --> 13:14.092
(Laughing)

13:14.094 --> 13:15.326
Hello.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.427
(Roaring)

13:16.429 --> 13:17.328
Waa!

13:17.330 --> 13:19.764
(Laughing)
Thanks for the lift!

13:19.766 --> 13:22.033
Now, let's get you
off the track.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.469
Rubble, you did it!
You saved the day!

13:24.471 --> 13:25.737
(Barking)

13:25.739 --> 13:27.205
Yip, yip!

13:27.207 --> 13:28.540

13:34.347 --> 13:36.548
Ladder up!

13:38.251 --> 13:39.350
Come on, baby pterodactyl.

13:39.352 --> 13:43.087
It's okay, I'm here to help.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.222
(Chirping)

13:44.224 --> 13:44.656
Waa!

13:44.658 --> 13:48.493
Ow, ooh, ah, ooh, ow, ooh, ah!

13:48.495 --> 13:51.129
I'm good!

13:51.131 --> 13:51.629
(Snoring)

13:51.631 --> 13:54.632
Aww, you are kind of
a cute little guy.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.769
I'll call you Terrance,
Terry for short.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.637
Terry Pterodactyl.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.773
(Chirping)

14:01.775 --> 14:03.174
Oh, no!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.776

14:04.778 --> 14:06.244
(Sniffing)
(Clucking)

14:06.246 --> 14:07.378
I have to save her!

14:07.380 --> 14:09.447
She's just a helpless
purse chicken!

14:09.449 --> 14:10.515
BOY:
It just wants to say hi.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.750

14:12.752 --> 14:14.285
(Roaring)

14:14.287 --> 14:16.120
Whoa!

(Screaming)

14:19.125 --> 14:20.491
Whoa!

14:20.493 --> 14:21.793
Chickaletta!

14:21.795 --> 14:23.661
Oh, I know you'd be fine!

14:23.663 --> 14:26.264
That's mommy's brave
little purse chicken!

14:26.266 --> 14:27.432

14:28.568 --> 14:29.267

<i> Ryder, I followed</i>

14:34.107 --> 14:36.307
Great!
Chase, can you go help?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.342
Chase is on the case!

14:37.344 --> 14:39.811
RUBBLE:
Look, Ryder!

14:39.813 --> 14:40.411
My new buddy!

14:40.413 --> 14:42.680
Cool!
(Laughing)

14:42.682 --> 14:44.449

14:44.451 --> 14:45.683
And his mom!
(Laughing)

14:45.685 --> 14:47.285
(Roaring)

14:47.287 --> 14:50.154
All right, Jurassic pups,
let's go!

14:53.193 --> 14:56.895
That dinosaur ate
all my fruits and veggies!

14:56.897 --> 14:59.764
What else is left to eat?

15:01.768 --> 15:04.202
(Growling)

15:04.371 --> 15:07.739
Oh no, those were
the pups' liver links!

15:07.741 --> 15:09.173
(Crashing)

15:12.412 --> 15:15.580
(Gasping)
What's that?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.448
RYDER:
It's the utahraptor.

15:17.450 --> 15:17.949
Look out!

15:23.256 --> 15:23.688
Whoa!

15:23.690 --> 15:26.724
A giant dinosaur's
stomping down Main Street!

15:26.726 --> 15:30.161
And he has our liver sausages!

15:30.163 --> 15:31.629
(Whimpering)

15:31.631 --> 15:33.932
(Siren blaring)

15:38.505 --> 15:41.940
SKYE:
The pterodactyl chick is
flying to the merry-go-round.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.409
I see him.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.176
Great.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.378
If you have this,
I'll go help Marshall.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.781
Chase is on the case!

15:53.219 --> 15:55.486
(Chirping)

15:57.824 --> 15:58.623

Home!

16:03.964 --> 16:04.629
(Chirping)

16:04.631 --> 16:07.665
Come on, little,
ugh, pterodactyl.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.335
I'm trying to get you
to your, ugh, mommy.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.503
She... misses... you...

16:12.505 --> 16:13.705
Oof!

16:13.707 --> 16:16.574
Ugh...

16:16.576 --> 16:18.509
Huh?

16:21.581 --> 16:22.780
(Chirping)

16:22.782 --> 16:24.849
Rar, net!

16:29.622 --> 16:30.455
Gotcha!

16:30.457 --> 16:33.257
(Screeching)
Huh?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.399
Told you she misses you!

16:41.401 --> 16:42.700
(Laughing)

16:43.937 --> 16:44.669
Phew!

16:44.671 --> 16:45.903
(Tires screeching)
Huh?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.405
Oh, you're here at last!

16:47.407 --> 16:49.640
You would never believe
what's been going on!

16:49.642 --> 16:52.276
Oh, I probably would.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.011
(Roaring)

16:53.013 --> 16:56.347
(Gasping)
Awesome, triceratops!

16:56.349 --> 16:57.915
It's okay, Mayor Goodway.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.817
These dinos are friendly.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.353
Well, okay then...

17:02.355 --> 17:03.154
Ryder, please do something

17:03.156 --> 17:04.689
before that dinosaur
eats our entire town!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.557
These prehistoric creatures
belong in the jungle.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.560
But how will you get them there?

17:09.562 --> 17:10.028
Hmm...

17:10.030 --> 17:11.829
Do you have anymore sausages?

17:11.831 --> 17:13.998
I have a few more in the fridge.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.699
Great!

17:14.701 --> 17:17.435
Rocky, can you whip me up
some sort of sausage slinger?

17:17.437 --> 17:17.969
I'm on it!

17:17.971 --> 17:21.372
Okay, pups, let's get some
dinosaurs back to the jungle!

17:23.977 --> 17:24.809

He follows me everywhere!

17:26.046 --> 17:26.911
SKYE:
Get in the harness.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.681
We'll lead him up to the nest.

(Barking)

17:31.851 --> 17:32.917
(Chirping)

17:32.919 --> 17:34.719
Come on, Terry.

Ah!

17:41.995 --> 17:42.794

17:42.796 --> 17:45.596
I'll go look for the last chick!

17:45.598 --> 17:47.799
Okay, Terry,
wait for your mom here.

(Chirping)

17:50.370 --> 17:52.537
(Screeching)

17:52.539 --> 17:53.538
Huh?

17:53.540 --> 17:54.705
Oof!

17:54.707 --> 17:56.607

I'm good.

(Chirping)

17:57.610 --> 18:00.011
(Screeching)

18:02.816 --> 18:05.450
No thanks,
I'm not a pterodactyl.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.486
I'm a pup, and pee-yew!

18:11.091 --> 18:12.824
(Laughing)

18:14.060 --> 18:16.561
Pee-double-yew!

18:18.064 --> 18:22.600
Ryder, how is your dinosaur
moving machine coming along?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.634
Almost there, Mayor Goodway.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.369
Please, hurry!

18:25.371 --> 18:27.538
Chickaletta can't take anymore!

18:27.540 --> 18:29.841
(Clucking)

18:29.843 --> 18:30.475
Don't eat that!

18:30.477 --> 18:33.644
Those are Mayor Goodway's
daisies!

18:33.646 --> 18:38.649
I was saving these treats for
an emergency, but here goes.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.951
Shovel, ruff!

18:45.091 --> 18:46.624

(Growling)

18:54.067 --> 18:55.600

18:55.602 --> 18:59.871
No one munches on
great-great-great grandpa!

18:59.873 --> 19:01.572
Hi-ya!

19:01.574 --> 19:03.374

19:03.376 --> 19:03.941
Chickaletta?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.611

19:06.613 --> 19:11.449

20:19.152 --> 20:19.750
(Grunting)

20:19.752 --> 20:22.987
Hey, Rubble, can you
help me with this?

20:22.989 --> 20:23.721
Sure!

20:23.723 --> 20:27.892
The dinos are like my rig,
but bigger and with feet.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.694
(Growling)

20:31.164 --> 20:32.997
You did it!

20:33.933 --> 20:35.066
(Chirping)

20:35.068 --> 20:35.633
(Laughing)

20:35.635 --> 20:38.936
(Screeching)

20:40.773 --> 20:42.506
(Squawking)

20:42.508 --> 20:43.407
Happy to help, pterodactyl mom.

20:43.409 --> 20:47.578
Whenever you're in trouble,
just squawk for help.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.646
(Chirping)

20:48.648 --> 20:50.615
(Roaring)

20:50.617 --> 20:53.084
ALL:
Oh, no!

20:53.086 --> 20:55.653
(Roaring)

20:55.655 --> 20:57.888
Nom-nom-nom-nom!

20:57.890 --> 20:59.223
All right, Rocky,
time to lead this parade--

20:59.225 --> 21:03.060
All the way to the jungle, ruff!

21:03.062 --> 21:04.729
Sausage slinger!

21:09.836 --> 21:11.702
(Roaring)

21:14.841 --> 21:15.373
(Chirping)

21:15.375 --> 21:19.577
Those chicks will get bigger
and hungrier in no time.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.212
Marshall, Skye, ready?

21:21.214 --> 21:21.646
Yep!

21:21.648 --> 21:25.750
But are you sure those
pterodactyls will follow me?

21:25.752 --> 21:28.552
Sure, you're like
one of the family.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.688
Besides, they love smelly fish.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.122
Ew!

21:31.124 --> 21:34.225
Wish I hadn't asked.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.861
Let's take to the sky!

21:38.631 --> 21:40.831
(Chirping)

21:40.833 --> 21:42.733
(Squawking)

21:42.735 --> 21:44.969
(Chirping)

21:44.971 --> 21:46.804
(Screeching)

21:46.806 --> 21:49.707
Bye-bye, birdies!

21:49.709 --> 21:51.842
You guys are going too?

21:51.844 --> 21:53.744
(Growling)

21:53.746 --> 21:54.845
Aww...

21:54.847 --> 21:57.548
They'll all be
happier in the jungle.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.150
Bye, guys!

21:59.152 --> 22:01.619
(Rumbling)

22:02.255 --> 22:04.955
(Whimpering)

22:06.092 --> 22:06.657
(Sighing)

22:06.659 --> 22:10.027
Saving dinosaurs
sure makes me tired.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.065
(Snoring)

22:17.036 --> 22:17.835
RYDER:
Rubble, Rubble!

22:17.837 --> 22:20.871
What, huh, what?

22:20.873 --> 22:21.739
Nifty news!

22:21.741 --> 22:24.241
Those eggs you excavated
are from a new,

22:24.243 --> 22:26.043
never-seen-before species!

22:26.045 --> 22:28.913
I named it the Rubbleasaurus!

22:28.915 --> 22:30.881
Wow, thanks!

22:30.883 --> 22:36.620
Marshall, did the pterodactyls,
utahraptor and triceratops

22:36.622 --> 22:38.022
make it to the jungle?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.091
Uh, what are you talking about?

22:40.093 --> 22:43.928
That was a doozy of
a dream you doggie dozed.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.664
Hmm, it was.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.198
(Laughing)

22:52.071 --> 23:02.046
