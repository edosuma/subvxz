Guess what I am, Ollie!

00:37.920 --> 00:39.559
Ssss!

00:39.680 --> 00:42.440
Hmm. Let's see. A... a turtle?

00:42.800 --> 00:44.559
-Mmm-mmm.
-A scorpion?

00:44.680 --> 00:46.400
-Mmm-mmm.
-Dinosaur?

00:46.519 --> 00:48.120
-Mmm-mmm.
-Taxi cab?

00:48.239 --> 00:52.040
-No! I was being a snake!
-Oh!

00:52.360 --> 00:55.080
My turn! I'll give you an easy one.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.360
-Hmm. A monkey?
-Mmm-mmm.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.720
-A frog?
-Mmm-mmm.

01:03.959 --> 01:08.119
I know! A whale on a pogo stick
eating peanut butter!

01:08.600 --> 01:10.479
-Mmm-mmm.
-I give up.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.399
-Aw! I'm a kangaroo!
-What?

01:13.600 --> 01:16.399
But a kangaroo doesn't
click its tongue like that.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.640
It taps its feet, like this!

01:20.280 --> 01:22.200
No wonder I couldn't guess it.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.839
Kangaroos do exactly what I did!

01:24.960 --> 01:27.119
No, they do what I did.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.399
If you'd ever met one, you'd know.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.839
Have you ever met a kangaroo, Ollie?

01:31.960 --> 01:35.440
-No. Have you?
-Well... no.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.759
Then there's no way to know who's right.

01:37.920 --> 01:43.080
Sure there is, because
I'm having a bouncy brainstorm!

01:43.320 --> 01:45.560
-Where to this time?
-Australia!

01:45.679 --> 01:48.039
Where there are mobs of kangaroos!

01:48.160 --> 01:52.440
Whoever's right will get
to be the champion of the game!

01:52.559 --> 01:57.679
Australia is pretty far away,
but I can't wait

01:57.839 --> 01:59.399
to prove I'm right.

02:00.240 --> 02:05.039
And I can't wait to show you
that I'm right!

02:05.160 --> 02:08.720
Now come on! Let's make
like a kangaroo and bounce!

02:08.880 --> 02:10.840
[laughter]

02:16.960 --> 02:18.079
Whoo!

02:19.239 --> 02:20.760
Whee!

02:29.079 --> 02:32.760
<i>Now arriving in Australia!</i>

02:39.440 --> 02:42.200
OK. We made it to the Australian bush.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.640
Now, to find out
who'll see a kangaroo first!

02:45.760 --> 02:47.359
How do we start?

02:47.480 --> 02:49.400
Here, kangaroo!

02:50.440 --> 02:52.239
Here, kangaroo!

02:52.400 --> 02:53.959
[clicks tongue]

02:54.079 --> 02:55.040
Nothing!

02:55.160 --> 02:57.040
Maybe we should hike into the bush a bit.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.799
But which way?

03:01.320 --> 03:03.359
Moon, what are you doing?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.519
I'm pretending to be a kangaroo.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.920
If I think like one,
I'll know which way to go.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.880
-Aha! This way!
-Moon, wait!

03:15.000 --> 03:17.799
I'm going to find a kangaroo
before you do!

03:18.280 --> 03:20.600
No, you aren't! I'll get there first!

03:20.760 --> 03:23.880
And then we'll see who's right!

03:24.000 --> 03:27.440
-You're bouncing fast, Ollie!
-So are you, Moon!

03:29.079 --> 03:31.040
But I'm bouncing faster!

03:31.160 --> 03:32.600
I don't think so!

03:32.760 --> 03:35.799
-Aaah!
-Oh, no! A dead end!

03:36.399 --> 03:39.119
-We must start the game over!
-Race ya!

03:39.280 --> 03:42.320
Whee!

03:42.799 --> 03:44.840
-Excuse us!
-Whoa! Pardon!

03:45.239 --> 03:48.359
Well, aren't you two adorable!

03:48.480 --> 03:50.679
I'm Bella. And you are... ?

03:50.799 --> 03:53.239
-Hi, I'm Moon.
-Hello, I'm Ollie.

03:53.399 --> 03:57.320
What's your hurry? You haven't
even checked out the view!

03:57.480 --> 03:59.799
Ooh! Could I take your picture?

03:59.959 --> 04:03.239
A picture is always better
with someone in it.

04:03.399 --> 04:04.679
-OK.
-Sure.

04:04.799 --> 04:08.000
But then we need to get going.
We took a wrong turn.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.320
What are you looking for?

04:11.480 --> 04:14.600
I'm just visiting too,
but maybe I can help.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.519
I know! Why don't we act out
what we're looking for?

04:18.640 --> 04:21.360
Good idea! Let's see
if you can guess, Bella!

04:21.519 --> 04:22.640
Me first!

04:23.280 --> 04:25.599
My impression is perfect.

04:25.719 --> 04:27.520
[clicks tongue]

04:30.240 --> 04:33.800
Well, you're looking for... Um...

04:33.920 --> 04:36.120
a chicken playing a drum?

04:36.240 --> 04:38.080
[imitates wrong-answer klaxon]
My turn!

04:38.240 --> 04:40.520
This time you'll get it. Easy!

04:42.840 --> 04:46.080
- Someone playing hopscotch?
- Hmm.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.640
Who's impatient?

04:49.039 --> 04:51.080
Who's very impatient?

04:51.200 --> 04:54.000
[both]
No. A kangaroo!

04:54.159 --> 04:56.800
How unusual. Really?

04:56.960 --> 04:59.400
I've never heard of a kangaroo
clicking its tongue

04:59.560 --> 05:01.200
or stamping its feet!

05:01.360 --> 05:04.080
Ooh! But I'd love to get a picture of one!

05:04.240 --> 05:06.000
-Can I help you look?
-Sure!

05:06.159 --> 05:07.560
Let's go!

05:11.520 --> 05:13.560
-Kangaroo?
-Kangaroo?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.520
Oh. Hi, Ollie.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.000
Hi, Moon.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.440
Kangaroo?

05:26.599 --> 05:28.800
Kangaroo?

05:31.520 --> 05:33.760
Slow down, you two!

05:34.080 --> 05:36.640
You're missing all the flowers!

05:36.800 --> 05:40.599
Look here! A bush lolly!

05:40.719 --> 05:44.039
Mmm! You suck the sweet nectar out.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.200
It's like nature's candy! Wanna try?

05:48.359 --> 05:50.880
Maybe later, Bella! Aha!

05:51.039 --> 05:54.159
I bet I'll see a kangaroo from up there!

05:58.440 --> 06:01.000
I bet you I see one first!

06:05.280 --> 06:07.760
Come on, kangaroo.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.400
I know you're out there somewhere!

06:14.120 --> 06:15.240
-Yes, Ollie?
-What?

06:15.359 --> 06:17.880
-You tapped me on the shoulder.
-No, I didn't.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.200
-Moon!
-Yes?

06:20.359 --> 06:22.960
Stop playing innocent. I know it was you.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.840
What was me?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.400
-Ollie!
-Moon!

06:28.560 --> 06:31.440
Can't you see
I'm trying to find a kangaroo?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.919
Hmm. I'm going to go look
by that waterfall.

06:35.039 --> 06:38.120
It's the perfect place
for a kangaroo on a hot day.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.359
-That's where I was gonna look!
-We can <i>both </i>look.

06:41.479 --> 06:44.080
But I'm going to find a kangaroo first

06:44.200 --> 06:46.919
and be the champion of the game!

06:47.039 --> 06:48.640
No, I am!

06:49.200 --> 06:54.120
Ollie! Moon! How about a picture? Oh!

06:54.960 --> 06:57.520
-Can't stop now!
-Racing to that waterfall!

06:59.400 --> 07:01.599
But, look, it's a kangaroo!

07:01.719 --> 07:03.640
Ollie! Moon! Wait!

07:03.760 --> 07:05.240
You're missing it!

07:05.359 --> 07:07.400
[panting]

07:09.880 --> 07:12.599
Up those steps to the waterfall!

07:12.719 --> 07:15.919
And a kangaroo
who'll show you that I'm right!

07:16.039 --> 07:18.280
No, that I'm right!

07:18.440 --> 07:20.640
Hop, hop!

07:26.239 --> 07:28.440
[groan]

07:31.280 --> 07:34.599
Oh, look! It's...

07:35.799 --> 07:36.840
Bella!

07:36.960 --> 07:41.000
[Bella struggles for breath]

07:41.159 --> 07:42.320
Ooh!

07:42.479 --> 07:44.280
Why don't you rest a bit, Bella,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.479
and have some water
while we look for the kangaroo?

07:48.200 --> 07:51.280
[Bella struggles for breath]

07:52.599 --> 07:54.599
You want us to carry this for you?

07:54.799 --> 07:56.960
OK. We'll wait for you at the top.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.080
Where I'm gonna find a kangaroo!

07:59.200 --> 08:01.239
Nuh-uh! I am!

08:05.760 --> 08:08.760
I can't believe it! No kangaroo?

08:08.919 --> 08:11.640
After all that? Oh...

08:11.799 --> 08:14.039
-I'm going to look over there!
-Moon, you can't!

08:14.200 --> 08:16.280
We have to wait for Bella, remember?

08:16.400 --> 08:18.400
But... Oh, fine.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.000
Wanna look at pictures
till she gets here?

08:21.159 --> 08:22.560
Might as well.

08:22.760 --> 08:23.599
[gasps]

08:23.719 --> 08:26.359
Ollie, look! It's gorgeous!

08:27.120 --> 08:31.280
-I don't remember seeing this!
-No. I can't believe it!

08:31.640 --> 08:33.959
Moon, we were so busy competing...

08:34.120 --> 08:37.959
That we missed the mountain
views and the flowers!

08:38.079 --> 08:38.919
[gasps]

08:39.039 --> 08:41.079
-And the kangaroo!
-Kangaroo?

08:41.439 --> 08:44.800
Aw! We raced right past it, Ollie!

08:45.199 --> 08:48.360
-Argh! I feel so silly.
-Me too.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.720
Winning isn't worth missing all this!

08:50.840 --> 08:53.240
Psst! Ollie! Moon! Look!

08:56.439 --> 08:58.439
Kangaroo!

08:58.600 --> 08:59.959
I tried to tell you,

09:00.120 --> 09:03.120
but you two were so busy racing
and trying to be first.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.520
Just look what she's doing.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.480
[gasps]

09:06.600 --> 09:08.840
Ollie, she's tapping her foot!

09:09.000 --> 09:10.959
She is!

09:11.120 --> 09:12.880
Moon, I guess this means you win the--

09:13.040 --> 09:14.160
-Hold on.
-Huh?

09:14.319 --> 09:16.319
She's clicking her tongue, Ollie!

09:18.520 --> 09:20.000
You were right, too!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.040
I guess kangaroos do both!

09:26.120 --> 09:27.760
Aw!

09:27.880 --> 09:30.480
So cute!

09:30.640 --> 09:33.720
And the best photo of my trip!

09:36.319 --> 09:38.640
I'm so glad we didn't miss this.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.760
Me too. Hey, Moon, on the way back,

09:41.880 --> 09:46.000
let's not race, so we can check
everything out along the way.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.319
What do you think?

09:47.439 --> 09:49.959
I'd say that's a winning idea, Ollie.
