WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.997
Spacecataz.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.009
It's time to send a message, Err.

00:10.043 --> 00:13.342
A message, comma, Err,
not a messenger.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.972
Let's just go.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.779
Look at them,
so stupid and so sad...

00:17.817 --> 00:19.751
that they admit
their own addiction.

00:19.786 --> 00:22.687
We know you eat your own farts.

00:22.722 --> 00:26.385
My name is Shake-Zula

00:26.426 --> 00:28.451
The mike ruler,
the old-schooler

00:28.495 --> 00:30.588
You want to trip,
I'll bring it to ya

00:30.630 --> 00:33.690
Frylock, and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop

00:33.733 --> 00:36.600
Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock

00:36.636 --> 00:38.968
Meatwad make the money, see

00:39.005 --> 00:41.439
Meatwad get the honeys, G

00:41.474 --> 00:44.034
Drivin' in my car,
livin' like a star

00:44.077 --> 00:45.704
Ice on my fingers
and my toes

00:45.745 --> 00:47.144
And I'm a Taurus

00:47.180 --> 00:49.944
Uh, check-check it, yeah

00:49.983 --> 00:51.974
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:52.018 --> 00:55.681
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

00:55.722 --> 00:57.519
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:57.557 --> 01:01.015
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

01:01.061 --> 01:02.926
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

01:02.962 --> 01:05.658
Number one in the hood, G

01:05.698 --> 01:07.996
Hey, hey. Yeah, you.

01:08.034 --> 01:11.970
Where is my high-powered
video game console?

01:12.005 --> 01:15.463
'Cause I will kick some ass
if I do not find it.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.100
I told myself
I wasn't going to...

01:17.143 --> 01:18.633
but you've been
very good this week...

01:18.678 --> 01:22.114
so I upgraded it
with these special chips.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.378
Hey, them chocolate chips.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.215
Yeah, and them's ants.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.585
<i>It's a new game
called Ant Madness...</i>

01:29.622 --> 01:32.420
only this time,
the game is real.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.222
Can you handle it?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.785
Deliciously. How's it work?
What's the object?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.991
How many bosses must I face?

01:39.032 --> 01:40.556
It is a race
against time and terror...

01:40.600 --> 01:42.761
to save the world,
starring Eric Stoltz.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.394
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I play this all the time.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.768
Play again!

01:45.805 --> 01:48.706
Hurry, man,
before there's still time.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.299
Just roll around in there?

01:50.343 --> 01:53.073
Yeah. Just piss them off
real good.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.512
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:54.547 --> 01:56.481
- Boom! Ha ho!
- Damn it.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.006
You are so predictable.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.712
- Pay up, babe!
- Shoot.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.915
I am the master
and the commander.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.753
Any more chocolate in there?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.053
I think we got it all.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.525
Damn, that's a good game...

02:07.560 --> 02:09.892
challenging yet nutritious.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.191
So let's play it again.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.630
Damn, don't you have
any other games?

02:12.665 --> 02:14.326
I found this one
under my pillow...

02:14.367 --> 02:15.925
thanks to the game fairy.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.197
<i>What's it called,
Anal Blazer?</i>

02:17.237 --> 02:19.797
'Cause that's what you like to
play over and over, don't you?

02:19.839 --> 02:21.966
You know how you play it?
I'll tell you.

02:22.008 --> 02:25.774
Level one is at a truck stop
filled with lonely truckers.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.975
Level two is at a public
rest room along the highway.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.006
- Shake.
- Shake! Whoo!

02:31.050 --> 02:33.541
Aw, you won already.
What do you want to do?

02:33.586 --> 02:35.611
I rule your world!

02:38.224 --> 02:41.523
Congratulations.
You're the Moonmaster.

02:41.561 --> 02:42.789
That's right, moon.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.696
You best check yourself
'fore you wreck yourself.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.963
Level two.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.333
Unbelievable.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.701
Yes, I am. Thank you.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.901
Level three.
Beware the Gorgotron.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.340
What's that old Gorgotron doing?

02:56.376 --> 03:00.472
He's in love.
Shoot him in the head.

03:00.513 --> 03:04.005
Head shot. Rampage.
Killing spree.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.518
<i>You have mastered Miinmaster.</i>

03:06.553 --> 03:08.783
You are the Moonmaster.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.120
No... ing way.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.126
Yes way, Err,
for we are blessed...

03:14.160 --> 03:17.061
to be in the presence
of the Moonmaster.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.291
But nobody makes it
past level three.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.594
Someone just did, Err.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.999
Bow down before him,
for he is our lord.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.799
That's right. Kiss the floor.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.532
Now, get up. You sicken me.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.666
- A million space pardons.
- OK.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.539
We have distributed this game...

03:30.577 --> 03:33.478
to seek out and find
gifted warriors to aid us...

03:33.513 --> 03:36.949
in our real-life struggle
against the real-life Gorgotron.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.384
- He's real, and he hates us.
- And he hates us.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.355
"The Gorgotron has destroyed
our armies and villages...

03:43.389 --> 03:45.289
"and people
and all of our pets...

03:45.325 --> 03:47.919
"and he has laid waste
to our craps".

03:47.961 --> 03:49.428
"Crops" is what I typed, Err.

03:49.462 --> 03:50.520
But it says "Craps".

03:50.563 --> 03:51.928
- I know, Err.
- "Craps" is funnier.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.364
I've processed that humor.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.196
It should be "craps" 'cause
"craps" is a funny word.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.759
Maybe we'll go with that.

03:56.803 --> 04:00.569
Anyway, the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the one...

04:00.607 --> 04:02.973
<i>and if you think I got that
from Star Trek...</i>

04:03.009 --> 04:04.943
you are very wrong, mister.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.969
So won't you please help us...

04:07.013 --> 04:08.844
save our craps?

04:08.881 --> 04:11.782
Err, please stop fueling
my silent rage.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.116
Anything for the future
of the moon.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.780
What kind of craps
y'all grow up there?

04:15.822 --> 04:17.517
Ain't got... up there, man.
It's the moon.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.750
First, we must train you.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.122
You can't go into battle
like that.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.183
He's right.

04:21.226 --> 04:22.990
You would
instantly turn to vapor.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.759
Well, what you need
is our free warrior kit.

04:25.798 --> 04:26.924
Oh, most definitely.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.627
We're selling it,
and you're buying it.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.933
It's got the helmet,
energy bars, electric shoes...

04:31.971 --> 04:34.906
<i>Gorgotron repellent,
Miinmaster stickers...</i>

04:34.941 --> 04:38.274
and now for the first time,
instructional video.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.744
And it's all free.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.440
OK. How do I get that?

04:41.481 --> 04:43.608
You pay far out the ass for it.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.118
It's just three
easy installments of $29.99.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.017
Unless you want
our race to die...

04:48.054 --> 04:49.817
which it seems like you do.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.221
Oh, no, no.
I don't want that...

04:51.257 --> 04:52.884
but I thought you said
it was free.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.222
<i>It was free.</i>

04:54.260 --> 04:57.058
A true warrior would have
jumped on it like a beast...

04:57.096 --> 05:00.759
before it went
straight up to $99.99.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.597
Well, damn,
I guess I do need training.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.193
What you need is recognition.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.330
For a one-time charge,
get your name placed...

05:06.372 --> 05:08.431
in this handsome,
leather-bound volume...

05:08.474 --> 05:10.032
<i>of Whi's Whi Aming Miinmasters.</i>

05:10.076 --> 05:12.101
You're the only one,
and you're on page one.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.909
Hey, you know what?
This is a pretty good deal.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.744
Yes, it is, Cathy.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.250
Shake!

05:18.284 --> 05:21.583
Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake,
Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake...

05:21.621 --> 05:22.645
What?!

05:22.689 --> 05:25.453
Oh, so you just waltz
out here and think...

05:25.491 --> 05:28.051
that you're gonna face
a true warrior...

05:28.094 --> 05:29.186
and then, you know...

05:29.228 --> 05:31.458
sign my sheet
to be part of my warrior list?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.828
Oh, you better believe I will...

05:32.865 --> 05:35.993
after these messages.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.195
Shake!

05:37.236 --> 05:41.673
I said you better come out here
and face a true warrior...

05:41.708 --> 05:43.699
All right. Is that it?
Has he been faced?

05:43.743 --> 05:46.041
You done messed up
the lunar scepter.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.570
There is but one
in the known galaxy.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.582
Well, thank God
I bought the 3-pack.

05:50.616 --> 05:53.881
Thank God I brought 3 shells.
Come on. Whip them out.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.251
Well, whip on this.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.518
All right. Hang on.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.787
"Sha na na na,
sha na na na na".

05:59.826 --> 06:02.659
- What the hell are you doing?
- "Get a job".

06:02.695 --> 06:04.890
"Get a job". What?

06:04.931 --> 06:07.764
Are you feeling any sort of,
like, melting sensation?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.394
No, but if I do,
I'm gonna totally tell on you.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.596
Then you'll have to go to jail.

06:11.637 --> 06:12.831
No, no, no, please! No jail.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.272
Oh, now that you mention it...

06:15.308 --> 06:17.401
No, no, no. Just...
I won't do it again.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.741
I won't do it again...
but stand still.

06:19.779 --> 06:23.545
I'm gonna do it again.
"Sha na na na... "

06:23.583 --> 06:24.607
Impossible.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.675
The lunar melting amulet
is constructed...

06:26.719 --> 06:28.118
of high-tensile moon noodles.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.486
No mortal man can destroy it.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.081
Yeah. That's right.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.889
Then you, too, are a Moonmaster.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.019
Now and forever.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.292
What else you got
in this catalog I can blow away?

06:38.331 --> 06:40.458
Oh, you got the catalog.
That's wonderful.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.730
I've been meaning to set up
an appointment with you.

06:42.769 --> 06:46.432
The fleece is nice,
but I don't like the zipper.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.600
First, you must pass
that which is unpassable.

06:49.642 --> 06:53.703
Congratulations.
You're the Moonmaster.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.373
- In your face!
- Unbelievable.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.714
- No way.
- Beyond all comprehension.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.877
Nobody makes it
past level three.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.151
Wait, except I did.
Remember me, guys?

07:04.190 --> 07:05.953
That's him. Remember him?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.391
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, yes.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.486
How surprisingly delightful.

07:09.529 --> 07:13.021
Two Moonmasters in one house.
What are the chances?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.259
- I'm not surprised.
- Me, neither.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.494
I'm damn good.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.833
So how does this work?
We got nationals?

07:17.870 --> 07:21.101
See, you also the savior
of their race, like me, OK?

07:21.140 --> 07:24.200
So you got to buy
all the stuff in this catalog.

07:24.243 --> 07:25.767
Then I get points.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.838
Then so do they get points,
and you get points, too...

07:28.881 --> 07:30.815
but so they can get
that Gorgotron killed...

07:30.850 --> 07:33.648
and somehow,
someone gets a Ferrari.

07:33.686 --> 07:36.780
Yeah. I get the Ferrari.
I'm the Moonmaster.

07:36.823 --> 07:40.190
- Now what?
- Go out and find fifty others...

07:40.226 --> 07:43.127
that are rich enough
to take pleasure in this facade.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.221
Yo, sign my thing.

07:45.264 --> 07:48.290
Well, you already signed mine.
Go out and do my bidding.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.461
- I don't know fifty people.
- Can I help someone?

07:50.503 --> 07:53.301
- Hey, buddy, how's it going?
- Come over here first.

07:53.339 --> 07:54.363
I want to show you
some literature.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.602
Show us how you sign your name.
I know you know how to do it.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.666
Did you bring a pen with you?

07:57.710 --> 07:59.974
Nobody's talking to you.
Let the adults speak.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.105
<i>I'll get you a Miinmaster pen.
How does that grab you?</i>

08:02.148 --> 08:04.616
I want you to take a look
at this Gorgotron repellent.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.379
Go over it at your own pace.
No pressure.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.819
But I do need you
to sign it right now.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.015
So buying all this stuff...

08:10.056 --> 08:11.523
is gonna help you kill
this Gorgotron thing?

08:11.557 --> 08:13.286
How? Just tell me that.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.123
Wouldn't your ass like to know?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.824
- That is why he asked.
- I know, Err. Shut up.

08:18.865 --> 08:21.527
I am in control
of this conversation.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.002
Well, I'm waiting.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.937
Well, while you wait...

08:26.973 --> 08:29.066
take a look at some of
our weaponry for spring.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.598
No, no. That stuff falls apart
in your hands.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.008
Just because
the temperature rises...

08:32.044 --> 08:33.841
doesn't mean
you can't still be prepared.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.407
I love the battle-axes
on page nine.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.283
Green is the new pink
in warrior shorts.

08:40.318 --> 08:41.946
You can get two of those
in the defender pack...

08:41.988 --> 08:43.922
which, for my money,
is the best deal.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.389
Shake, will you get that
out of my face?

08:45.424 --> 08:46.584
Alert him to the fact...

08:46.626 --> 08:48.924
that we will throw in
a wacky wall walker...

08:48.961 --> 08:51.191
his choice of five colors...

08:51.230 --> 08:53.892
if that's what it takes
for the dog to bite.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.798
Just give me an example
of your signature.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.097
- Shake.
- What?

08:57.136 --> 08:59.798
He has a friend
that made over $2 million...

08:59.839 --> 09:02.399
doing this out of the house.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.272
That is very extremely true.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.005
That old boy didn't
even have to get dressed.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.275
Look here.
There's a naked picture of him.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.179
Aw, man.
I thought we cut that out.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.081
We did. If you will excuse us...

09:12.118 --> 09:14.348
we have a meeting
with our printer.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.048
Well, why would you want
to go up there?

09:16.088 --> 09:18.420
I mean, that's where
this Gorgotron is, right?

09:18.457 --> 09:20.891
W- well, I know that.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.794
I said that,
but it's his nap time now.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.262
Because he, like,
sleeps during the day.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.629
But at night, he feeds.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.860
And it's always night
on the moon.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.162
Don't... with me, Err.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.226
"Hello, lady or gentleman
of the house.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.828
"My name is... insert name...

09:32.872 --> 09:35.340
"and I am the one and only
Moonmaster...

09:35.374 --> 09:38.571
"savior of... "
Uh... aw, man.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.738
They already talked to you,
didn't they? Damn it!

09:40.780 --> 09:41.940
Who?

09:41.981 --> 09:43.414
While he ain't looking,
would you sign this?

09:43.449 --> 09:44.473
No, you don't. Sign mine.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.247
Oh, I'm the one. I need points.
I'm still a cadet here.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.277
Please, Moonmasters, silence.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.189
Yeah. Shut up.
The Gorgotron approaches.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.555
Uh-oh.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.153
W- wait a minute.
Are you serious?

09:56.195 --> 09:59.062
I only got one signature.
Are we ready?

09:59.098 --> 10:02.033
You're always ready,
for you are a Moonmaster.

10:02.068 --> 10:05.231
That's right, and see you later.
We got to go harvest our craps.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.638
- Err, please.
- Ha ha ha ha!

10:10.109 --> 10:12.942
Hmm. Where's the Gorgotron?

10:12.979 --> 10:15.812
- There is no Gorgotron!
- Oh, thank God.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.476
I mean, you think
we'd defeat him with this?

10:18.517 --> 10:21.042
We each should've had
our own defender packs.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.816
Yeah. That's the one
with the stickers...

10:22.855 --> 10:25.881
<i>and the instructional video...
Hiw ti Wirk Stickers.</i>

10:25.925 --> 10:27.449
I found it to be informative.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.290
All right.
Look, for the record...

10:29.328 --> 10:32.422
I know that there ain't
no Gorgotron, all right?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.695
I'm just doing this
for the Ferrari.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.032
You know some naked dude
made over $2 million...

10:37.069 --> 10:38.559
doing this out of the house?

10:38.604 --> 10:40.868
I know.
They were friends with the guy.

10:40.906 --> 10:44.398
Tell him, Err,
with your parallelogram mouth.

10:44.443 --> 10:47.105
Now, see, what you need
is the official keychain.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.307
So you got to upgrade
to the Stargate Pack.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.340
You mustn't face the Gorgotron
with your keys all willy-nilly.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.409
He's right.

10:54.887 --> 10:58.550
Oh, sh...
You're the Gorgotron?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.558
Yes, Err.
I told you this was a mistake...

11:00.593 --> 11:01.787
that you were making.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.490
I'll tell you what, Gorgotron.
I'll throw in the keychain.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.362
How you like that?
You like that, fatty?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.027
You are a fatty!

11:09.068 --> 11:10.262
Aah!

11:10.302 --> 11:12.827
He said no, Err...
with his foot.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.204
Dancing is forbidden

11:15.241 --> 11:18.210
Dancing is forbidden

11:18.244 --> 11:21.236
Dancing is forbidden

11:21.280 --> 11:23.407
Dancing is forbidden

11:23.449 --> 11:25.508
Dancing is forbidden
