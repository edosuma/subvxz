The situation is
getting to the point

contact social services.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.034

15:05.121 --> 15:06.775
That would tear
this family apart.

I walk around with him

pay you for this.

I give the best back massages.

little high in my opinion,

unless this was pesos,
of course. [laughs]

It was my mother's.

What do you want?

31:28.712 --> 31:31.759
- Just leave everything I have
to global warming prevention

31:31.846 --> 31:36.285
and wildlife preserves in
South Africa and South America

31:37.808 --> 31:41.987

are indigenous to.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.032
They're very important to me.

31:44.119 --> 31:45.033

32:07.534 --> 32:09.928
you were the first five-star

I don't think I'm ready still.

32:26.509 --> 32:30.078
- Slater, all the board
of directors wants

32:30.165 --> 32:33.038
is to meet the new
CEO, which is you.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.171
- CEO, it sounds a lot like GMO.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.085
I don't want anything

32:37.172 --> 32:38.782
to do with that.
- No.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.089
CEO, chief executive officer.

it, goals and gains.

All she wanted to do
was be with Mr. Park.

get my chi in order.

40:55.496 --> 40:56.715
[electricity crackles]

40:56.802 --> 40:59.195
It'd be so amazing
and beautiful,

40:59.282 --> 41:03.722
and we could have our own
home with our own kids.

41:03.809 --> 41:04.723
- Marriage, huh?

41:04.810 --> 41:06.333
That's a big thing.

41:06.420 --> 41:09.641
That's a big step and
transition into adulthood.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.294
I-

41:11.381 --> 41:13.993
- Sweetheart, my parents think
I'm getting a little old.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.081
I mean, come on.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.344
We would be amazing parents,

41:17.431 --> 41:19.607
and you've seen my
parental skills.

41:19.694 --> 41:22.610
They are on point. [laughs]

41:22.697 --> 41:24.046
- I feel like I really
need to be there

41:24.133 --> 41:26.788
for my brother and
my sisters right now.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.877
- It's always been about them.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.139
- Yeah, I need to
be there for them.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.663
- Okay, but [sighs]

41:31.750 --> 41:36.058
this is where we find a
solution to that problem.

41:36.145 --> 41:37.495
I know you may be worried,

41:37.582 --> 41:40.410
but we can send them
to boarding school.

41:42.108 --> 41:46.591
- Lana, I don't know how a
school for surfing would help.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.507
Wait, are you talking
about that thing

41:49.594 --> 41:51.073
where we send 'em out to
another part of the world

41:51.160 --> 41:52.422
all year round,

41:52.510 --> 41:53.380
away from their home?
- No, no, no.

41:53.467 --> 41:55.034
We see them during holidays,

41:55.121 --> 41:56.949
and you know, they get
structure in their lives.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.385
They need that.

41:58.472 --> 41:59.342
- [Slater] I agree, but
that's not the answer.

41:59.429 --> 42:00.779
That's not gonna happen.

42:00.866 --> 42:02.345
They need to be here
with family, Lana.

42:02.432 --> 42:04.565
- They can be a little
annoying, you know, Slater.

42:04.652 --> 42:07.481
- They need to be here
with their family,

42:07.568 --> 42:08.700
and I'm the only
one they have left,

42:08.787 --> 42:10.310
and I'm going to be there.

42:10.397 --> 42:13.052
That's out of the question.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.662
- I'll let you think
about it, okay?

42:14.749 --> 42:16.142
All right.

42:16.229 --> 42:18.187
I'm gonna go now.

42:18.274 --> 42:20.450
I'll see you later, okay?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.364
[Lana screams]
[Lana thuds on floor]

42:21.451 --> 42:22.844
- [Slater] Lana!

42:23.976 --> 42:25.586
Hey!

42:25.673 --> 42:26.805
- [Lana] See what I'm talking
about? This is ridiculous!

42:26.892 --> 42:28.502
- [Slater] No, no, no, no, no.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.244
- This is why I said boarding
school, and they deserve it.

42:31.331 --> 42:32.158
- Lana, Lana, listen.

42:32.245 --> 42:32.941
[Lana huffs]

42:33.028 --> 42:34.073
Lana.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.857
- You know what?

42:35.944 --> 42:38.947
You need to get your
priorities straight. [huffs]

42:39.034 --> 42:41.559
- Lana! [sighs]

42:42.821 --> 42:43.996
[door slams]

42:44.083 --> 42:45.214
- Actually.
- Lana, thank God.

42:45.301 --> 42:46.564
- No, no.
[Slater stutters]

42:46.651 --> 42:47.739
- Lana.
- I'm not talking to you.

42:47.826 --> 42:48.566
This is not happening.

42:48.653 --> 42:49.915
I forgot this.

42:50.002 --> 42:50.829
That's all.

42:50.916 --> 42:53.527
[bags crunching]

42:55.485 --> 42:58.358
[door slams]

42:58.445 --> 43:00.926
[phone rings]

43:03.406 --> 43:04.190
- Hey.

43:06.366 --> 43:08.586
No, the offer was legitimate.

43:10.152 --> 43:12.590
Yeah, we would, we
would love to have you.

43:12.677 --> 43:13.373
[bright music]

43:13.460 --> 43:16.071
[zipper zips]

43:21.207 --> 43:22.600
- What's up?

43:22.687 --> 43:24.036
- So I actually have
plans for tonight.

43:24.123 --> 43:25.428
I was wondering if you could

43:25.515 --> 43:27.561
start watching the
kids immediately.

43:27.648 --> 43:30.346
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

43:30.433 --> 43:33.872
- And I don't know how
to say this exactly.

43:35.525 --> 43:38.441
The kids, they
can be a little...

43:45.448 --> 43:46.058
A handful.

43:46.145 --> 43:47.407
- Okay.

43:47.494 --> 43:50.628
- And I don't know
where they got it from,

43:52.368 --> 43:53.805
but they're animals,

43:53.892 --> 43:56.546
so just I'm looking out
for your safety here, okay?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.200
So just be safe.

43:58.287 --> 43:59.680
- Thanks.

43:59.767 --> 44:01.900
It's probably nothing
I can't handle.

44:01.987 --> 44:03.510
- Okay, I hope so.

44:03.597 --> 44:06.774
I just, I can't afford
another lawsuit. [laughs]

44:06.861 --> 44:07.557
Good luck.

44:07.645 --> 44:08.602
Thank you, Aisha.

44:08.689 --> 44:09.516
I appreciate it.

44:09.603 --> 44:10.996
- Yeah, have a good night.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.520
[upbeat music]

44:13.607 --> 44:14.956
- Lana.

44:15.043 --> 44:17.480
Lana, please, Lana, listen.

44:17.567 --> 44:18.264
Listen, Lana.

44:18.351 --> 44:19.569
Lana.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.440
Lana.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.660
Lana.

44:24.531 --> 44:26.185
I'm sorry.

44:26.272 --> 44:27.621
Lana, I'm sorry.

44:27.708 --> 44:28.535
Listen, Lana.

44:30.798 --> 44:32.495
How many times do I have
to say it? I'm sorry, Lana!

44:32.582 --> 44:33.888
Please.

44:33.975 --> 44:35.237
- Maybe until you
actually mean it,

44:35.324 --> 44:36.282
and when you get
rid of those kids

44:36.369 --> 44:38.937
and stop putting them before me.

44:39.024 --> 44:42.767
- Well, unfortunately,
I'm all they got,

44:42.854 --> 44:45.030
so I'm not going anywhere.

44:46.074 --> 44:47.641
- Well, you know what?

44:47.728 --> 44:50.557
They can go to boarding school.

44:50.644 --> 44:52.602
- That's not gonna happen.

44:53.865 --> 44:54.822
- Yes it is.

44:57.346 --> 44:58.391
- No it's not.

44:58.478 --> 44:59.740
[May yells]

44:59.827 --> 45:01.176
[children laughing]

45:01.263 --> 45:02.090
- Oh gosh.

45:02.177 --> 45:03.135
Die!
[Archer yelling]

45:03.222 --> 45:03.962
Die, molester!

45:04.049 --> 45:04.789
Die!

45:07.443 --> 45:10.533
- Okay, okay, okay,
guys, it's time for bed.

45:10.620 --> 45:11.970
- We don't wanna go to bed.

45:12.057 --> 45:14.668
- [May and April] Yeah,
we don't need a nanny.

45:14.755 --> 45:16.322
- Okay.

45:16.409 --> 45:19.238
Well, you got one,
so it's bedtime.

45:20.195 --> 45:21.501
Come on, march.

45:23.372 --> 45:26.245
[May and April sigh]

45:27.768 --> 45:30.684
And you, you need
to brush your teeth.

45:31.816 --> 45:34.209
[Aisha grunts]

45:34.296 --> 45:36.690
Hey, let me see those teeth.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.128
Hand me that toothbrush.

45:41.739 --> 45:45.003
There is nothing
on this toothbrush.

45:45.090 --> 45:47.788
Hand me that toothpaste.

45:47.875 --> 45:50.051
- I don't want toothpaste.

45:51.270 --> 45:53.446
- It's organic toothpaste.

45:54.534 --> 45:57.015
[toothbrush brushing]

45:57.102 --> 45:59.800
You are just like your brother.

46:03.673 --> 46:05.675
- Can I brush your hair?

46:05.763 --> 46:06.720
- Sure.

46:06.807 --> 46:09.767
[mischievous music]

[Archer and May laugh]

46:48.457 --> 46:50.895
[April spits]

46:57.336 --> 46:59.729
[all laugh]

47:02.515 --> 47:03.472
That's mine.
- Give me the banana, May.

47:03.559 --> 47:04.560
- [May] No.

47:04.647 --> 47:05.431
- May.
- Give me, give me that.

47:05.518 --> 47:06.345
- I want the banana!

47:06.432 --> 47:07.520
- It's already mine.

47:07.607 --> 47:08.216
I claimed it.
- Hey, cool it

47:08.303 --> 47:09.957
with the banana.

47:10.044 --> 47:11.089
There you go.

47:13.831 --> 47:14.701
Okay.

47:14.788 --> 47:16.094
Pancakes.

47:16.181 --> 47:17.704
Oh, hey, your shirt's
all messed up.

47:17.791 --> 47:19.793
Let me fix that for you.
- No, it's fine.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.882
He's my brother.
- I got this. I got this.

47:24.580 --> 47:27.670
- You're not gonna
fix your shirt?

47:27.757 --> 47:28.541
You are?

47:30.021 --> 47:30.804
Oh, okay.

47:32.110 --> 47:33.720
That's cool.

47:33.807 --> 47:37.115
I bet all the girls at school
dig a sloppy dresser, right?

47:37.202 --> 47:39.030
- [May] Can we eat now?

47:40.161 --> 47:40.683
- Yeah.

47:42.207 --> 47:45.601
Sure, here, let me
get you your pancake.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.609
Yeah, those are good.

48:07.275 --> 48:08.929
- What are you doing?

48:11.366 --> 48:13.194
- I'm praying over our food.

48:13.281 --> 48:14.587
- Why?

48:14.674 --> 48:16.894
- Because that's
what Christians do.

48:16.981 --> 48:17.720
- Weirdo.

48:17.807 --> 48:20.245
[bright music]

48:21.768 --> 48:23.639
- Yeah, get as high
as you can get it.

48:23.726 --> 48:25.293
- [May] I'm not tall.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.294
- Nice, that's good.

48:26.381 --> 48:27.643
That's perfect.

48:27.730 --> 48:29.123
Just hold it up
so it doesn't fall

48:29.210 --> 48:31.604
by the time I get over here.
- I switched the spot.

48:31.691 --> 48:33.823
Yep, it's folding.

48:33.911 --> 48:34.912
- Is that the same height?

48:34.999 --> 48:35.738
- Eh, maybe.

48:35.825 --> 48:36.609
- Oh.

48:36.696 --> 48:37.784
- Okay.

48:37.871 --> 48:38.654
Nice.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.310
[hands slap]
- Guys, this looks great.

48:42.397 --> 48:44.008
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I thought so.

48:44.095 --> 48:48.664
- Except, you know, I don't
think Slater would like this.

48:49.665 --> 48:51.058
It's tacky being in the middle

48:51.145 --> 48:53.887
and right in his face
when he walks in.

48:53.974 --> 48:56.629
Wouldn't he want
to see, hmm, me?

48:57.891 --> 48:58.805
- I'll put it over there.

48:58.892 --> 49:00.198
He's the birthday boy.

49:00.285 --> 49:02.069
We'll do one more.

49:02.156 --> 49:03.114
- Thank you.

49:06.595 --> 49:07.770
- Hi, Lana.

49:07.857 --> 49:09.903
You look so pretty tonight.

49:09.990 --> 49:11.861
I wanna be like
you when I grow up.

49:11.949 --> 49:12.558
- Thank you, April.

49:12.645 --> 49:13.559
You're so sweet.

49:13.646 --> 49:15.039
- Your face is so symmetrical

49:15.126 --> 49:17.867
and your nose is just
my favorite part.

49:17.955 --> 49:21.523
- [laughs] You're adorable.

49:23.003 --> 49:26.311
Well, looks like things
are coming together.

49:26.398 --> 49:29.009
Slater's gonna love this.

49:29.096 --> 49:30.402
And the fact that I made
it perfect. [laughs]

- Lana.

49:41.108 --> 49:42.501
- Ray.

49:42.588 --> 49:45.504
- I didn't know this
was a costume party.

49:45.591 --> 49:47.897
- What do you mean by that?

49:49.508 --> 49:50.900
- Nothing.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.991
Guess we're all just
clowning around.

49:58.299 --> 49:59.605
[door clicks]

49:59.692 --> 50:02.521
- Slater has the
stupidest friends.

50:03.957 --> 50:05.306
- Okay guys, shh, shh.

50:05.393 --> 50:06.090
He's here.

He's here.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.974
Anybody here on this day
of no particular event?

- [Group] Surprise!

50:25.065 --> 50:25.979
[Slater yells]

50:26.066 --> 50:26.849
- You guys got me!

50:26.936 --> 50:28.851
I was so surprised!

50:28.938 --> 50:30.201
- To my number one man.

50:30.288 --> 50:31.811
Happy birthday.

50:31.898 --> 50:34.944
- You don't want me getting
a big head or anything.

50:35.032 --> 50:35.728
[April laughs]

50:35.815 --> 50:37.077
- Oh.

50:37.164 --> 50:38.470
[Ray laughs]

50:38.557 --> 50:40.385
- Were you just waiting
to do that all day?

50:40.472 --> 50:42.213
- Happy birthday, old man.

50:42.300 --> 50:44.084
[Ray and Slater grunt]

50:44.171 --> 50:44.867
- What's new?

50:44.954 --> 50:45.781
- Hey man, gains.

50:45.868 --> 50:46.695
That's it, brother.

50:46.782 --> 50:48.001
- Gains, there we go.

50:48.088 --> 50:49.611
Hey, baby?

50:49.698 --> 50:51.048
What's...

50:51.135 --> 50:51.831
- What?

50:51.918 --> 50:53.006
What is that?

50:53.093 --> 50:53.833
Ew.

50:55.791 --> 50:58.011
[Lana huffs]

51:00.535 --> 51:01.275
Oh my

51:04.017 --> 51:05.758
God.

51:05.845 --> 51:09.283
Anyways, I just want
to make a little toast

51:11.459 --> 51:13.026
to my future husband

- Yes, ma'am.
- So sweet of you.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:56.261
[giggles] Well,

01:00:57.566 --> 01:00:58.785
cheers.

01:00:58.872 --> 01:01:00.482
[glasses clink]

01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:02.267
I'm gonna make you so happy.

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:03.660
- I know you will.

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:06.575
[tense music]

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:07.664
- Mm.

01:01:09.622 --> 01:01:11.319
Drink some more.

01:01:11.406 --> 01:01:14.366
- Actually a little
tired, so I'm good.

01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:15.236
- Oh?

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:19.501
Well, I have a surprise for you.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.722
Close your eyes.

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:31.513
All right, open them.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.124
Ta-da! [giggles]

01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:34.821
- What's this?

01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:39.565
- It's just the top 10 boarding
schools in North America.

01:01:39.652 --> 01:01:43.177
The kids would be on the same
continent as us. [giggles]

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:44.526
- Boarding schools again, huh?

01:01:44.613 --> 01:01:46.006
I thought-

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:47.399
- I'm thinking about
our future, Slater.

01:01:47.486 --> 01:01:48.313
- I thought that
we'd been over this.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.662
It's not gonna happen.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.577
That's never going
to happen, Lana.

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.231
Please.

01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:56.016
I think you should leave.

01:01:56.103 --> 01:02:00.325
[Archer grunts]
[electricity crackles]

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:03.589
- [sighs] Good riddance.

01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:09.769
- What have you done
to my little brother?

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.162
[Lana laughs]

01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:13.555
The only good one
left in my family!

01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:15.557
- He was a nuisance!

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:17.690
And he was mildly annoying.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:19.257
- You're pure evil.

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:22.521
You must be stopped!
[Lana laughs]

01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:24.131
I will stop you!

01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:26.960
- You have never been
able to defeat me.

01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:27.744
[electricity crackles]

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:28.962
- No, I'm a man!

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:30.442
- [Lana] You're whipped!

01:02:30.529 --> 01:02:31.356
You're whipped!
[Slater yells]

01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:32.879
- No, I'm in control!

01:02:32.966 --> 01:02:34.489
I am-
[Lana laughs]

01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:37.275
[Slater yells]

01:02:37.362 --> 01:02:39.190
- But what about me?

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:41.583
[heroic music]
- Easily.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.716
[Aisha grunts]

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.414
[Lana laughs]

01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:47.285
[Aisha yells]

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:49.635
[Lana yells]

01:02:49.722 --> 01:02:51.419
You'll kill me!

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:52.246
- Yes!

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:56.468
The evil has been defeated!

01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:57.425
The galaxy is safe!

01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:58.905
- Yes!

01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:01.690
- And it's all thanks
to you and Jesus!

01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:09.655
- I'm leaving because
I wanna leave, okay?

01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:10.961
- Okay.

01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:13.920
[footsteps tapping]

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:16.618
[tense music]

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:23.625
- [Lana] Slater, this is
still mine, and so is this.

01:03:23.712 --> 01:03:26.672
[footsteps tapping]

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:30.676
- Teach me to do your
will, for you are my God.

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:32.547
Your spirit is good.

01:03:32.634 --> 01:03:33.766
Lead me in the land of-

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:35.159
[phone rings]

01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:36.682
Oh.

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:39.728
[laughs] Hello?

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:40.599
Hi, Barry.

01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:42.470
Oh my gosh.

01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:43.341
What's up?

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.604
Really?

01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:48.607
Well, what are you doing here?

01:03:48.694 --> 01:03:49.738
For me?

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:51.697
Wow, I...

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:53.612
Okay.

01:03:55.048 --> 01:03:57.834
You know, I've been
praying for you.

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:58.660
Yeah.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:00.837
Tonight?

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:02.795
Yeah, I would love to.

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.231
[Archer gags]

01:04:04.318 --> 01:04:05.667
Hold on.

01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:07.669
[hand slapping]
Hold on one second.

01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:08.583
Here, I'm gonna
call you back, okay?

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.497
- I'm okay.

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:10.455
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:12.674
- Are you really okay?

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:14.154
Oh, hey, Slater.

01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.113
- Hey, what's up?

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.810
- I was wondering,

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:21.509
are you gonna be home kind
of early-ish tonight or...

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.731
- Actually, I do
think I do have plans.

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:27.559
- Okay, okay.

01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:29.778
I have a friend in town, so...

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.563
- Okay, a friend, all right.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:32.869
- Yeah.

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.567
I wanted you to meet him.

01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:36.437
- Him.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:40.615
Yeah, well, that sounds...

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:42.008
Yeah, sounds good.

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:43.836
- [Dr. Figgis]
What's wrong, Slater?

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:47.753
- She's out tonight with
some Missionary Barry.

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.712
- Does that bother you?

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:51.757
- Bother me?

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:53.019
No. [laughs]

01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:55.413
Why would it bother me?

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.460
- Since we've been here,
all you've done is complain.

01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:03.682
- I mean, how much do we really
know about Missionary Barry?

01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:06.772
- Sounds like you
could be jealous.

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:08.774
- Jealous? [laughs]

01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:09.688
Me?

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:10.907
No.

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.212
No.

01:05:12.299 --> 01:05:13.300
- [Aisha] No way.

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:14.040
- I did.
[door clicks]

01:05:14.127 --> 01:05:14.998
- You did?

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.695
Barry. [laughs]

01:05:16.782 --> 01:05:18.349
You are still the same.

01:05:19.959 --> 01:05:21.221
- [Barry] I really had
a great time tonight.

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:22.353
- [Aisha] Me too.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.789
- I gotta be honest.

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.443
The last time I was out
in the mission field,

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:29.273
there were some really
dangerous times,

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.886
and I guess I just wanna say
it's been great being back.

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.281
- I'm really glad you're safe.

01:05:38.412 --> 01:05:39.848
- I guess I'll talk to you soon.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.981
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:45.811
[door clicks]

01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:47.639
Drive safe.
- Okay.

01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:48.770
[door clicks]

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:51.817
[footsteps thud]

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:53.427
- Hello?

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.387
Is somebody there?

01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.913
[sheepish music]

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.045
What are you doing in the dark?

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:02.741
- Hey.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.701
Just getting a
gluten-free bagel.

01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.400
What's with the third degree?

01:06:09.487 --> 01:06:10.444
It's my house.

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:11.315
- Oh, yep.

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:14.318
Okay.

01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.279
- You're the new CEO, Slater.

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:21.238
You gotta show your face.

01:06:22.717 --> 01:06:24.589
- I mean, this is
my dad's company.

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:25.416
He earned it.

01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:26.721
I didn't earn it.

01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:28.854
I didn't-
- Listen, it doesn't matter.

01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:30.987
You're the one in charge now.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:31.857
Step up

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.381
and do your job.

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:39.996
[phone ringing]

01:06:41.736 --> 01:06:43.738
- Yeah, I'll try to
make the next meeting.

01:06:43.825 --> 01:06:44.609
- Great.

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:46.915
Great.

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:55.837
- [Latonia] But seek ye
first the kingdom of God

01:06:55.924 --> 01:06:58.492
and His righteousness,
and all these things

01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:00.320
shall be added to you.

01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:02.975
Therefore, do not worry-

01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:03.845
- Hey, Slater.

01:07:03.932 --> 01:07:05.847
Sorry, Latonia.

01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:08.198
Would you like to join us?

01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.026
- What's this?

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.985
- We're having our Bible study.

01:07:13.072 --> 01:07:16.249
- So that's what you
meant when you... [laughs]

01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:17.511
No, thank you.

01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:21.472
Looks like fun though.

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:23.996
You guys look like good people.

01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:29.045
Wouldn't steal anything
from a family home.

01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:34.267
Children who just lost
the parents, you know.

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:37.053
Just remember

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:42.928
whenever those carnal
instincts rise up, just,

01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:44.582
what would Jesus do?

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:49.413
Right, have a good time, guys.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.111
- Aisha, I thought you said
this was gonna be okay.

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:53.330
- It's fine, really.

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:54.635
He's just...

01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:55.897
He gets...

01:07:55.984 --> 01:07:56.594
He's quirky.

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:57.899
- Okay.

01:07:57.986 --> 01:08:00.641
- Hope so.
- Alrighty, verse 34.

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:06.430
[bowling balls thud]

01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:07.561
- [Aisha] Hey, how's Lana?

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:08.910
[bowling pins clatter]

01:08:08.997 --> 01:08:11.522
- Well, she's all
right, I guess.

01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:17.049
- You planning on
proposing anytime soon?

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.921
- I haven't even
met her parents.

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:21.053
- Oh.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.187
- The whole thing is scary.

01:08:24.274 --> 01:08:25.970
I don't know.

01:08:26.058 --> 01:08:29.453
- Okay, well, I'll
be praying for you.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.367
- Pray for me?

01:08:30.453 --> 01:08:32.499
Why would you pray for me?

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:37.983
It's 'cause you're
a good person.

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:41.682
You know, Aisha, I
never thought about it.

01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:44.207
You really do care
about other people.

01:08:44.294 --> 01:08:46.470
You're gonna make some
guy really happy one day.

01:08:46.557 --> 01:08:48.298
- [Aisha] Thank you.

01:08:48.385 --> 01:08:49.777
- Sir, your order.

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:50.604
[Slater screams]

01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:52.127
[Aisha laughs]

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:53.912
- [Slater] Thank you.

01:08:56.087 --> 01:08:57.568
- That looks amazing.

01:08:59.004 --> 01:08:59.961
- Would you like
some cotton candy?

01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:01.398
- Yes, please.

01:09:01.484 --> 01:09:02.312
- For the lady.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:03.313
Hey, hey!

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.095
Kids, this is mine!

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:05.053
What?

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.881
[upbeat music]

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:10.667
- Hey, you gotta share, May.

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:12.060
[juice splashing]

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.975
- Aisha, would you like
some pineapple juice?

01:09:15.063 --> 01:09:16.978
Maybe a little wine later?

01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:18.109
Wine turns into-

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:18.893

[glass clatters]

01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:22.984
[Slater laughs]

01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:24.943
- Pineapple juice
is what I said.

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:25.899
- Oh.

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:27.032
[phone rings]

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:27.685
- How long have you been there?

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:29.077
- Hello?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.122
Oh, hi, Barry.

01:09:30.209 --> 01:09:30.644
Fine.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.300
Yeah, yeah, I'm on
my way out right now.

01:09:34.386 --> 01:09:35.432
Okay.

01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:36.911
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:38.390
Okay, bye.

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:39.479
- Where are you going?

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:40.263
- Church.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.612
It's Sunday.

01:09:41.698 --> 01:09:43.439
- You have to go every Sunday?

01:09:43.527 --> 01:09:46.877
- Well, I don't have
to, but I want to.

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.792
Do you wanna come?

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.751
- Maybe next time.

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:51.622
- Okay.

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.667
- Hey, Aisha.

01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:56.192
- [Aisha] Yeah.

01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:58.585
- You look really nice.

01:09:58.672 --> 01:09:59.630
- Thank you.

01:10:08.856 --> 01:10:09.640
- Barry.

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:15.820
[sighs] Missionary Barry.

01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:18.779
- Judge not, that
you be not judged,

01:10:18.866 --> 01:10:20.912
for with what
judgment you judge-

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.914
[door clicks]
- Gosh.

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:23.871
So difficult.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.482
- I'm fine, by the way.

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:27.962
- [Latonia] It will be
measured back to you.

01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:29.834
- Aren't you worried
what they're wearing?

01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:34.447
[scoffs] Okay, I've had enough.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:37.058
She's taking over your house.

01:10:37.145 --> 01:10:38.538
You need to fire her.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:40.236
[Aisha sighs]

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:41.628
- Just...

01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:42.934
- Fire her.

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.065
Fire Aisha.

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:45.589
[Slater stutters]

01:10:45.676 --> 01:10:46.938
- No, no, no, no.

01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:47.895
Stop it.
- Shh.

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:49.027
- Stop it.
- Shh.

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:49.723
Shh.
- No, this is embarrassing!

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:50.681
Quit it!

01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:53.205
You know what, Slater?

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:55.642
It's either her or me, okay?

01:10:57.862 --> 01:11:00.386
You can have your little
goody-goody church girl,

01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:05.086
or your gorgeous, loving,
kind, and intelligent fiance.

01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:08.612
Hmm?

01:11:12.006 --> 01:11:13.921
- Maybe I choose her.

01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:15.053
- Are you crazy?

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.620
[tense music]

01:11:16.707 --> 01:11:20.014
- Maybe I am just a
little crazy. [laughs]

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:21.799
- What is wrong with you?

01:11:21.886 --> 01:11:23.409
We are done!

01:11:23.496 --> 01:11:25.629
We are over, Slater!

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.935
[Lana huffs]

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:29.807
- Please, Lana, don't go!

01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:30.634
I'm so sad!

01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:32.288
Please, I'm sorry!

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:38.598
Oh, what, you all enjoy
the show at my house?

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.209
Here, move over.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.082
I probably need some of this.

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:46.084
Excuse me, sir, that's my seat.

01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:48.478
Sir, I always sit there!

01:11:48.565 --> 01:11:49.305
Thank you.

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.133
And my sugar-free bonbons there.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.962

[Slater hisses]

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:03.667
- Whew, you need to
change the air in here.

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:07.192
Good morning.

01:12:09.281 --> 01:12:10.456
How are you feeling?

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.458
[Slater groans]

01:12:12.545 --> 01:12:13.981
Yeah.

01:12:14.068 --> 01:12:15.940
- Is Lana here?

01:12:16.027 --> 01:12:17.289
- No, no.

01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:18.334
She actually...

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:20.553
You probably wanna call her.

01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:24.296
- Oh no.

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:28.344
Oh yeah, mm-mm.

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:31.347
Okay. [sighs]

01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:34.698
- I went ahead and
I made you some tea.

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:38.005
- No thank you.

01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:40.181
I think I'd be better
with some coffee, black.

01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:42.314
Extra black, if you can.

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:44.969
- Yeah, tea's gonna be better.

01:12:45.056 --> 01:12:47.537
[Slater sighs]

01:12:49.408 --> 01:12:51.976
[Slater slurps]

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:55.719
- I was, I wanted to ask you.

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.765
I wanted to know if it was okay

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:02.465
if I invited a friend
over for dinner tonight.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.294
- Barry.

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:12.605
- Guys?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.174
Would you listen to that?

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:20.744
This house is so quiet
without the kids.

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:22.354
- I'm so happy.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.835
One of their friends decided
to let them sleep over.

01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:26.010
- Wow.

01:13:26.097 --> 01:13:28.926
- I need to step in more often.

01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:30.406
- Kids can be a handful.

01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:31.276
- Yeah.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:36.499
- Yeah, they

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:39.589
need prayer.

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:40.633
- We all do.

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:44.420
- So,

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:48.989
Barry, tell me about yourself.

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:52.645
- I'm just a missionary.

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:57.041
- You're just a
Missionary Barry.

01:13:57.128 --> 01:13:59.260
- He's not just a missionary.

01:13:59.347 --> 01:14:01.785
Barry, you're a
great missionary.

01:14:03.569 --> 01:14:08.226
- Well, I've been in Indonesia
the past five years working

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.489
in a children's orphanage.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:12.230
- Do they have social
media out there?

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.232
- Fresh farmer's markets or-

01:14:14.319 --> 01:14:15.494
- Local coffee shops.

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:16.452
- Yes.
- Must.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:17.757
That's a must.

01:14:17.844 --> 01:14:19.063
- We don't really have those,

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.369
those kinds of
luxuries actually.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.980
- So why do you do it?

01:14:24.634 --> 01:14:29.290
- You know, honestly, when
you see what God is doing

01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:33.381
in the hearts of those
children day in and day out,

01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:39.126
there's really nothing
that's more rewarding.

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:40.388
[utensil clatters]

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.868
- Well, you know,

01:14:41.955 --> 01:14:44.436
I've always wanted to
be a missionary myself.

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:46.046
It's just I haven't gotten
around to it because there's,

01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:48.266
you know, I got, I
got things to do.

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:50.050
- Oh, that's great.

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:52.444
Where have you been called?

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:56.840
- Yeah, Missionary Slater,
where have you felt called?

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.627
[Slater slurps]

01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.287
- DQ.

01:15:09.374 --> 01:15:11.419
- I've never heard of DQ.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.682
Where's that?

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:15.946
- It's near Afghanistan,
and you know,

01:15:16.033 --> 01:15:18.905
the kids there are
very impoverished.

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:23.083
Well, the thing is, the Lord's
still moving on my heart

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.521
on where He wants to place me.

- For church, of course.

01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:50.850
- You're coming with us?

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:52.417
- It's Sunday, right, kids?

01:15:52.504 --> 01:15:54.332
We always go to
church on Sundays.

01:15:54.419 --> 01:15:55.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.987
Well, in that case,

01:15:57.074 --> 01:16:00.773

made for you a while ago.

- That's right.
- Yay!

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:08.302
- I think every missionary
needs his own Bible.

01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:09.652
- With their name on it.

01:16:09.739 --> 01:16:10.696
That's what you made for me.

01:16:10.783 --> 01:16:12.132
Cool.

this is Slater's Bible.

- Yay.
- Cool.

All right, all right,
I'll lead the way, guys.

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:20.184
I've been there many times.

01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:21.272
Oh yeah, this way.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:22.882
This way, sorry.
- One question.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:24.449
- [Slater] What's that?
- [Aisha] He'll lead the way.

- Well, in the Bible, this
is how we surrender to God.

And this was what happened

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:19.243
in a conversation recorded
in John, chapter three.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:20.592
Nicodemus said to him,

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.638
"It's evident that
God is with you

"because you're
doing this stuff."

01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:28.426
about the subject
of being born again,

- What does he
mean by born again?

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.653
I've already been born.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.915
That doesn't make sense.

I'll explain it all afterwards.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.835
Maybe we should just listen.

- I am listening.

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:48.359
I just want him to explain it.

01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:49.882
- [Pastor] Can he
enter a second time

01:17:49.969 --> 01:17:51.275
into his mother's
womb and be born?

"That which is born of flesh-"

01:27:31.202 --> 01:27:32.725
- It's a mystery.

01:27:35.206 --> 01:27:37.382
- Let not your
heart be troubled.

01:27:37.469 --> 01:27:38.340
You believe in God.

01:27:38.427 --> 01:27:40.080
Believe also in me.

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:42.431
In my Father's house,
there are many mansions.

01:27:42.518 --> 01:27:45.695
If it were not so, I
would have told you.

01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:48.524
I go to prepare a place for you.

01:27:48.611 --> 01:27:50.221
- I miss Mom and Dad.

01:27:50.308 --> 01:27:51.309
- Me too.

01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:56.662
- You know, we'll see
'em again one day.

01:27:56.749 --> 01:27:57.707
- In heaven?

01:28:00.536 --> 01:28:02.146
- Yeah, in heaven.

01:28:06.498 --> 01:28:08.021
I love you guys.

01:28:08.108 --> 01:28:09.284
- Love you too.

01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:10.241
- Love you.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:15.942
[wine splashing]

01:28:18.989 --> 01:28:19.859
- So I don't know
if I told you this,

01:28:19.946 --> 01:28:21.905
but I'm a Christian now.

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:25.212
- A what?

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.346
- A born-again Christian.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.393
- Oh, that's great.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:35.092
That calls for a toast.

01:28:35.179 --> 01:28:36.267
My best chardonnay.

01:28:36.354 --> 01:28:37.964
- Actually, no thank you.

01:28:38.051 --> 01:28:39.575
I'm a real Christian.

01:28:39.662 --> 01:28:41.925
Apparently we don't drink.

01:28:42.012 --> 01:28:43.056
- A real Christian.

01:28:43.143 --> 01:28:44.275
What is that?

01:28:46.277 --> 01:28:47.670
- Let me show you.

01:28:47.757 --> 01:28:50.847
You should come to
our church on Sunday.

01:28:50.934 --> 01:28:52.588
- Church, yeah, uh-huh.

01:28:52.675 --> 01:28:54.285
Let me think about it.

01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:55.460
- I also wanted you
to set up a meeting

01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:57.027
with the board of directors.

01:28:57.114 --> 01:29:00.247
There's a couple
things I wanna go over.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.772
I'd like to see some changes.

01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:05.340
- Son of a gun.

01:29:08.473 --> 01:29:13.348
It took becoming a Christian
for you to decide that?

01:29:13.435 --> 01:29:17.134
- Well, there's just a
lot in my life going on,

01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:21.268
and trying to get everything
organized and in order.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:23.270
I think that's right.

01:29:25.403 --> 01:29:27.013
[glass clinks]

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:27.884
- So,

01:29:31.931 --> 01:29:33.759
what time does church start?

01:29:33.846 --> 01:29:37.197
[engine whirring]

01:29:37.284 --> 01:29:38.242
- You know, I'm really proud

01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:41.724
of the changes that you've made.

01:29:41.811 --> 01:29:44.683
I always knew you
had a good heart.

01:29:45.597 --> 01:29:46.729
- Really?

01:29:46.816 --> 01:29:48.208
- Yeah.

01:29:48.295 --> 01:29:51.037
God showed me this
potential that you had,

01:29:51.124 --> 01:29:55.999
and, well, He obviously
wouldn't let me give up on you.

01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:58.218
- Well, thank you for
being patient with me.

01:29:58.305 --> 01:29:59.306
- You're welcome.

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:02.135
[bright music]

01:30:10.187 --> 01:30:11.623
- Lana.

01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:13.930
What are you doing here?

01:30:14.017 --> 01:30:16.759
- I really just
wanna say goodbye.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.419
I do still love you, but

01:30:27.204 --> 01:30:29.511
I know you don't want me back,

01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:32.818
and I've accepted that.

01:30:36.518 --> 01:30:38.911
So I just need some closure.

01:30:46.266 --> 01:30:49.444
[gentle guitar music]

01:31:05.329 --> 01:31:08.375
- [sighs] Bye, Slater.

01:31:16.296 --> 01:31:18.037
- Hey, Aisha!

01:31:18.124 --> 01:31:19.604
You gotta look at a
picture of this ocelot.

01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:21.171
It's so cute.

01:31:21.258 --> 01:31:22.259
It's a baby.

01:31:33.313 --> 01:31:35.315
I thought you'd changed.

01:31:51.462 --> 01:31:53.377
[Slater yells]

01:31:53.464 --> 01:31:56.728
[foot stamping]

01:31:56.815 --> 01:31:59.557
[foot stamping]

01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:03.387
[feet stamping]

01:32:07.304 --> 01:32:11.526
[woman speaking in
foreign language]

01:32:16.182 --> 01:32:17.227
- Slater?

01:32:17.314 --> 01:32:19.882
- What are you guys doing?

01:32:19.969 --> 01:32:21.884
- Can we go to church
tomorrow with Aisha?

01:32:21.971 --> 01:32:22.711
- Please?

01:32:24.495 --> 01:32:25.975
- Aisha?

01:32:26.062 --> 01:32:26.932
Is that her on the phone?

01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:27.803
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:29.282 --> 01:32:30.414
- Yeah, of course.

01:32:30.501 --> 01:32:31.546
That's fine.

01:32:31.633 --> 01:32:33.330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:32:33.417 --> 01:32:34.461
- Yeah.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:35.375
All right, go on.

01:32:35.462 --> 01:32:36.942
Read some books.

01:32:37.029 --> 01:32:38.988
- [May] You're the best.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.690
- Indeed, the trials of
our life are real trials,

01:32:45.777 --> 01:32:48.693
but thankfully we
serve a real God.

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.173
So let's bow our heads

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.871
for a moment together
in silent prayer.

01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:56.005
[gentle organ music]

01:33:02.446 --> 01:33:05.057
[door clicks]

01:33:19.158 --> 01:33:20.812
- Excuse me, sir.

01:33:20.899 --> 01:33:22.292
May I sit there?

01:33:24.381 --> 01:33:25.469
Sir, can I please sit down?

01:33:25.556 --> 01:33:26.513
It's important.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.560
[woman clears throat]

01:33:40.353 --> 01:33:41.093
Thank you.

01:33:48.579 --> 01:33:50.363
- What are you doing here?

01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:52.627
- I'm here to pray, Aisha.

01:33:59.242 --> 01:34:00.286
I tried calling.

01:34:00.373 --> 01:34:01.113
- I know.

01:34:04.073 --> 01:34:05.117
You know, it's
really inappropriate

01:34:05.204 --> 01:34:07.467
that you're here right now.

01:34:14.779 --> 01:34:18.827
- I just, I just wanted
to give you this.

01:34:18.914 --> 01:34:19.828
- No.

01:34:19.915 --> 01:34:21.133
- Please.

01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:21.960
Open it.

01:34:22.047 --> 01:34:23.396
- No.

01:34:23.483 --> 01:34:24.223
- Open.

01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:25.355
Open the box.

01:34:25.442 --> 01:34:26.922
- No, I'm not going to open it.

01:34:27.009 --> 01:34:28.924
- Just open it, please!
- I'm not gonna open it!

01:34:29.011 --> 01:34:29.925
- Please!

01:34:30.012 --> 01:34:32.536
- Just open it so he shuts up!

01:34:32.623 --> 01:34:33.755
- Come on, open it.

01:34:33.842 --> 01:34:35.017
- It's okay.

01:34:35.104 --> 01:34:37.106
- [Congregation] Open it.

01:34:37.193 --> 01:34:38.498
Open it!

01:34:38.585 --> 01:34:39.891
Open it!

01:34:39.978 --> 01:34:41.458
Open it!

01:34:41.545 --> 01:34:42.589
- [Woman] Open the box.

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:44.156
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:34:46.158 --> 01:34:48.595
[bright music]

01:34:55.515 --> 01:34:56.865
Oh.

01:34:56.952 --> 01:35:00.172
- I just want you
to know how I feel.

01:35:00.259 --> 01:35:02.827
See, I've always had a
hard time expressing.

01:35:02.914 --> 01:35:04.437
I feel like all these
other women I've been with,

01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:06.352
they've always brought
out the worst in me,

01:35:06.439 --> 01:35:09.834
but everything changed
when I met you.

01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:11.793
There's something
different about you,

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.056
and I didn't know what it was,

01:35:14.143 --> 01:35:16.406
but now I know it's because

01:35:17.581 --> 01:35:18.887
the God that you believe in,

01:35:18.974 --> 01:35:22.151
the God that we
believe in, He's real.

01:35:26.329 --> 01:35:28.070
And I know I love you.

01:35:29.636 --> 01:35:32.335
[Aisha laughs]

01:35:34.859 --> 01:35:39.516
- Slater, you know, I knew
from the minute that I saw you

01:35:41.213 --> 01:35:43.476
that you were the one.

01:35:43.563 --> 01:35:46.523
You were going to be
a project, [laughs]

01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:48.046
but you were the one.

01:35:48.133 --> 01:35:49.744
- Well, thank you.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:52.007
- I love you too.

01:35:53.486 --> 01:35:54.749
Yes.

01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:57.490
- All right, all
right, all right.

01:35:57.577 --> 01:36:00.493
Let's get our eyes
back on the Lord.

01:36:03.975 --> 01:36:05.934
- Welcome our new creed!

01:36:07.544 --> 01:36:08.763
- [Group] Huzzah!

01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:14.507
- You know, Aisha?

01:36:14.594 --> 01:36:15.247
Things are really starting-

01:36:15.334 --> 01:36:16.118
- Shh.

01:36:17.467 --> 01:36:19.991
[relaxed music]

01:36:34.658 --> 01:36:35.702
- April.

01:36:37.661 --> 01:36:38.618
It's yours.

01:36:38.705 --> 01:36:40.098
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:36:47.236 --> 01:36:48.759
Looks really good on you.

01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:50.021
- Thank you.

01:36:50.108 --> 01:36:50.805
Ow.

01:36:50.892 --> 01:36:51.893
Hey!

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:52.807
- [May] Hey!

01:36:52.894 --> 01:36:53.982
Ow!

01:36:54.069 --> 01:36:55.200
- Can we give May away?

01:36:55.287 --> 01:36:56.288
- [May] You hit me in the face!

01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:57.289
- You'll be fine.

01:36:57.376 --> 01:36:58.160
It's not the first time.

01:36:58.247 --> 01:36:59.726
Ow!

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:00.945
- [May] That does not
make it better, okay?

01:37:01.032 --> 01:37:01.946
- Shh.

01:37:02.033 --> 01:37:03.295
No one asked you to speak.

01:37:03.382 --> 01:37:05.907
[dramatic music]

01:37:05.994 --> 01:37:07.822
It was a game.

01:37:07.909 --> 01:37:09.606
Can we give May away?

01:37:12.348 --> 01:37:13.436
- [May] They like
me best anyway.

01:37:13.523 --> 01:37:14.916
[bright music]

01:37:15.003 --> 01:37:18.745
I don't think anyone
likes you the best.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:21.618
[engine whirring]

01:38:20.285 --> 01:38:22.940
[upbeat music]

01:40:22.494 --> 01:40:25.236
[energetic music]
