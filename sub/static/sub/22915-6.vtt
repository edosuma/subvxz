WEBVTT

00:01.147 --> 00:03.828
Previously on "Shut Eye"...
There's an ancient tradition.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.431
The master of the house

00:05.432 --> 00:09.034
would allow a faithful servant
to buy his freedom.

00:09.451 --> 00:10.916
How much are we talking about?

00:10.917 --> 00:12.918
$50,000 should be reasonable.

00:12.919 --> 00:14.319
$100,000.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.280
I don't want this in my shop.

00:16.282 --> 00:18.724
Fonso tell you his last
phone bank was raided

00:18.725 --> 00:20.846
by the LAPD Task Force?

00:22.849 --> 00:24.530
Jesus, Mom.

00:24.531 --> 00:25.531
Get to work.

00:25.532 --> 00:27.172
Come on.

00:27.173 --> 00:29.416
Damn it, Charlie. Hurry the fuck up.

00:31.257 --> 00:34.179
I'm hearing a voice. Gina.

00:34.180 --> 00:36.982
He reads our e-mails,
and he does a background check.

00:36.983 --> 00:38.944
How could he have known about Gina?

00:38.945 --> 00:40.546
You're preying on my wife.

00:40.547 --> 00:43.909
Linda is working very hard
to open herself up

00:43.910 --> 00:45.471
to radical honesty.

00:45.472 --> 00:49.595
Why do you want to fail?

00:49.596 --> 00:52.518
I don't know.
Why don't you ask your friend...

00:52.519 --> 00:55.320
Damn it, Charlie. Hurry the fuck up.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.884
I want to feel your teeth on my skin.

01:00.887 --> 01:03.128
I was man enough to keep the money.

01:04.450 --> 01:05.731
Jun-Bi!

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.237 --> 02:13.319
You fucked up.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.766
So did you.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.995
Hm.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.370
Couldn't sleep again?

04:24.371 --> 04:28.334
Not really.
Just needed a change of venue.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.735
You know how it is.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.797
I do, indeed.

04:32.859 --> 04:34.460
Hey.

04:34.461 --> 04:37.103
Here you go.
Mm.

04:39.471 --> 04:41.707
Oh, uh, if you weigh the beans first,

04:41.708 --> 04:45.310
it's much easier to control
the strength of the brew.

04:45.311 --> 04:47.153
Hey, Mom, Dad, check this out.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.117
Not bad, kiddo.

04:52.118 --> 04:55.721
And he's been practicing his Tarot, too.

04:55.722 --> 04:57.202
Really?

04:57.203 --> 04:59.805
Yeah, I even, uh,
read Dad the other day.

04:59.806 --> 05:01.807
What'd the cards say?

05:01.808 --> 05:03.329
You don't want to know.

05:03.330 --> 05:04.621
Huh.

05:05.692 --> 05:07.973
Better get going.
Yeah, I'll drive you.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.455
All right.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.745
Hey, you.

05:19.746 --> 05:21.667
Ah, 11:00's good.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.910
Right.

05:24.911 --> 05:26.893
I'll be seeing you.

05:28.019 --> 05:29.314
Another hike?

05:29.778 --> 05:30.904
Tomorrow.

05:30.905 --> 05:32.441
Nora again?

05:33.960 --> 05:36.882
You remaking my itinerary the
way you're remaking my coffee?

05:36.883 --> 05:38.655
I didn't mean it like that.

05:39.823 --> 05:41.086
It's just indicative.

05:41.450 --> 05:42.688
Indicative of what?

05:42.689 --> 05:44.770
Your general mood since we got back.

05:44.771 --> 05:46.852
From our weekend of peace and truth?

05:46.853 --> 05:51.096
Yeah. This last month,
you just haven't been quite the same.

05:51.097 --> 05:53.098
Which was the point.

05:53.099 --> 05:54.379
Right.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.102
We can talk about it later.

05:57.103 --> 05:59.384
No, I'm happy to talk about it now.

06:01.511 --> 06:02.828
Why does it bother you so much

06:02.829 --> 06:05.070
that I've been spending time with Nora?

06:05.071 --> 06:07.953
I don't know.
To me, she'll always be Dr. White.

06:07.954 --> 06:10.516
So it's just a little weird.

06:10.517 --> 06:14.880
Honestly,
she's become my spiritual tune-up coach.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.322
Spiritual tune-up coach?

06:17.444 --> 06:20.205
Paz's idea. It's like an AA sponsor.

06:20.206 --> 06:24.570
Oh. Maybe she can coach you
into making decent coffee.

06:24.571 --> 06:27.212
Hey, Mom. We're gonna be late.

06:27.213 --> 06:28.814
Love you, too.

06:28.815 --> 06:30.496
Have a good day.

06:31.818 --> 06:33.820
Bye, Dad.
Bye, son.

06:48.635 --> 06:50.268
These the new wheels?

06:51.269 --> 06:52.998
Five-star safety rating,

06:52.999 --> 06:56.762
voted best in its class
three years running.

06:58.244 --> 07:00.245
And to think,
when we first bought this place,

07:00.246 --> 07:02.688
you had just been banished and
your life was in the shitter.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.908
You've turned things around, amigo.

07:05.652 --> 07:07.533
SiÂ­.

07:07.534 --> 07:11.657
As you think, so shall you become.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.138
Bruce Lee said that.

07:13.139 --> 07:15.260
Fuck him. You and I got a busy morning.

07:15.261 --> 07:18.864
We got to go over the handicap parking,
the new fire code,

07:18.865 --> 07:22.147
and we got to deal with
this cocksucker pawnshop guy.

07:22.148 --> 07:25.712
He's refusing to pay his rent
until we fix his phone line.

07:27.305 --> 07:29.057
Let's start with him.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.479
We don't want him
calling the phone company.

07:44.010 --> 07:47.292
Well,
if it isn't Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

07:47.293 --> 07:48.494
Good morning, Bob.

07:48.495 --> 07:50.912
You call me Mr. Caygeon, boy.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.419
Yes, sir, Mr. Caygeon.

07:53.915 --> 07:55.061
That's more like it.

07:56.918 --> 07:58.378
You hear that?

07:59.025 --> 08:00.466
No, you don't.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.908
Because there's nothing on there
but static.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.911
Ever since you two
fucktards took charge,

08:05.912 --> 08:08.193
the phones haven't worked for shit.

08:08.194 --> 08:11.196
Now, call me crazy,
but I think I'm being gypped.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.079
Not surprising,
considering there's a filthy gypsy

08:14.080 --> 08:15.604
running the joint.

08:17.647 --> 08:19.805
We prefer the term Romani.

08:19.806 --> 08:23.489
Well, I don't give a fat
flying fuck what you prefer.

08:23.490 --> 08:25.451
I want my goddamn phone fixed!

08:25.452 --> 08:29.134
Several other tenants have had
telecommunication issues.

08:29.618 --> 08:33.379
Rest assured this'll be resolved
at no cost to you.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.780
I got a guy who -
I want an American.

08:36.124 --> 08:39.461
Not some fence-fairy who doesn't
know his head from his asshole.

08:40.629 --> 08:43.469
We will make... everything right.

08:43.715 --> 08:45.431
I promise.

08:45.432 --> 08:48.514
How about a discount
on this month's rent, hmm?

08:48.928 --> 08:51.637
Don't even think about
trying to fuck with me.

08:51.638 --> 08:54.360
You don't want to see me when I'm cross.

08:54.976 --> 08:56.923
Now get the hell out of my shop.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.452
Have a nice day.

09:08.094 --> 09:09.975
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

09:09.976 --> 09:11.657
Calm down.

09:11.658 --> 09:14.259
Did you hear the shit that was
coming out of his mouth?

09:14.260 --> 09:16.542
Well, he's a paying tenant.

09:16.543 --> 09:18.183
He's a racist pig.

09:18.184 --> 09:20.826
I should go back in there
and rip his fucking head off.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.908
One cannot be angry with those

09:22.909 --> 09:25.631
who have not the capacity for change.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.713
More Bruce Lee shit?

09:27.714 --> 09:30.075
Look at the big picture.

09:30.076 --> 09:32.678
We're legit businessmen now.

09:32.679 --> 09:34.319
You sure?

09:34.320 --> 09:37.683
'Cause I could get rid
of this sick fuck real quick.

09:38.103 --> 09:40.526
Give me a chance to mediate this.

09:40.772 --> 09:44.530
If I'm gonna talk the talk,
I need to walk the walk.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.172
All part of the new you, huh?

09:47.173 --> 09:49.254
Mediation.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.936
Okay.

09:50.937 --> 09:52.826
You deal with this fucker.

09:54.244 --> 09:56.902
And I'll bite my tongue, all right?

09:56.903 --> 09:59.082
Jun-Bi.
Yeah.

10:00.306 --> 10:01.627
I won't let you down.

10:01.628 --> 10:03.549
Hmm.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.559
You're late.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.882
Traffic on the 405.
There's nothing I can do.

10:18.925 --> 10:22.047
Take Sepulveda. It's always moving.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.291
Your tomatoes are coming in so nicely.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.338
I've been waiting and waiting

10:32.339 --> 10:35.701
for you to give me some
information on the Council.

10:36.077 --> 10:38.204
Honestly, you've given me nothing.

10:38.913 --> 10:41.667
My case is only as good as my evidence,

10:41.958 --> 10:44.830
which is only as good as my informant.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.673
I got you all this paper
from White Tony's files -

10:47.674 --> 10:50.383
Which are not the smoking gun
I need to bring charges.

10:51.077 --> 10:52.918
I think you're stalling.

10:53.470 --> 10:54.920
I've done everything you've asked me.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.162
Rita,
you're not seeing how this plays out.

10:57.163 --> 10:58.975
Well, then enlighten me.

10:59.886 --> 11:02.743
I need photos, dates, and names.

11:02.744 --> 11:04.690
You've got to bring me something now.

11:04.894 --> 11:07.976
If not, the only thing that
I have to offer the department

11:07.977 --> 11:11.339
is you... and your granddaughter.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.982
She's married to the head
of the Ranko crime family.

11:13.983 --> 11:17.410
In theory,
she could walk away from all this.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.069
But do you really want to take
the chance that she doesn't?

11:38.047 --> 11:39.516
My private number.

11:40.329 --> 11:42.450
Call me when you get serious.

11:50.139 --> 11:52.100
Oh, hey, Charlie, I almost forgot.

11:52.101 --> 11:53.782
You had a cancellation.

11:53.783 --> 11:55.624
Marty is now coming every other week.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.305
Did he say why?

11:57.306 --> 12:00.068
Something about saving money
to go to some retreat.

12:00.069 --> 12:01.910
Thanks.

12:01.911 --> 12:03.071
Great.

12:07.356 --> 12:10.158
Business looks a little quiet.

12:10.159 --> 12:12.641
If you're here about the rent,
I've already paid Eduardo.

12:12.642 --> 12:14.442
I know. We're good.

12:14.443 --> 12:18.366
Good. I would like to lodge
a complaint with my landlord.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.248
What?

12:20.249 --> 12:23.612
Your shady call center
is fucking with my phone lines.

12:23.613 --> 12:25.333
I'll get our guy straight on it.

12:25.334 --> 12:26.775
Thank you.

12:26.776 --> 12:29.778
But I need you to do something for me.

12:29.779 --> 12:31.940
Are you telling me,
or are you asking me?

12:31.941 --> 12:33.027
Asking.

12:33.903 --> 12:36.224
Just one little favor.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.154
For me.

12:39.415 --> 12:40.976
Partner?

12:47.156 --> 12:49.998
That was really, really eye-opening.

12:49.999 --> 12:51.880
Thank you.

12:51.881 --> 12:54.322
I am just a conduit to your own truth.

12:54.323 --> 12:55.924
See you next week, Linda.

12:55.925 --> 12:57.726
Oh, you bet.

13:01.010 --> 13:05.333
Sorry to drop in unannounced,
but your sign was on.

13:05.334 --> 13:08.136
No worries. What brings you to town?

13:08.137 --> 13:10.979
Exploring several
business opportunities.

13:11.608 --> 13:13.381
When I saw your name on the order,

13:13.382 --> 13:15.383
I thought I would drop it by myself.

13:15.384 --> 13:18.066
Oh, well,
I appreciate the personal delivery.

13:19.228 --> 13:20.829
Let's see what we got.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.350
Is Charlie not working today?

13:22.351 --> 13:24.833
Well, not here.
We've opened another parlor.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.034
He's there most days.

13:26.035 --> 13:28.516
Ah! His and hers.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.462
How is our Charlie handling all this...
equity?

13:33.122 --> 13:35.003
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

13:35.004 --> 13:36.646
Oh, I think you do.

13:38.207 --> 13:39.688
How's Paz?

13:39.689 --> 13:43.131
He's curious. About Charlie.

13:43.132 --> 13:44.773
So are you.

13:44.774 --> 13:46.655
Yes, indeed.

13:46.656 --> 13:49.457
I am curious about your Charlie.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.459
He and Paz didn't seem to click,

13:51.460 --> 13:54.623
and, well, frankly,
he had an awful weekend.

13:54.624 --> 13:58.066
And I don't like having
an unsatisfied customer.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.468
Really?
Really.

14:00.469 --> 14:02.871
Where's your store?
A shitty strip mall.

14:02.872 --> 14:04.118
East Valley.

14:05.074 --> 14:09.037
I have always wanted to see
a shitty strip mall

14:09.038 --> 14:10.541
in the East Valley.

14:12.882 --> 14:14.203
Thank you.

14:16.926 --> 14:18.326
Call first.

14:18.327 --> 14:20.168
Will do.

14:23.372 --> 14:26.535
$1,100, $1,200...

14:26.536 --> 14:27.896
$1,350.

14:27.897 --> 14:29.658
Well done.

14:29.659 --> 14:32.230
Your math is getting better.
Time to ditch the calculator.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.650
Finish up in your father's office.

14:36.105 --> 14:38.708
I'm almost done.
Now, please.

14:48.678 --> 14:53.201
So, what about our other arrangement?

14:53.202 --> 14:56.044
I've run into a bit
of a cash-flow problem.

14:56.045 --> 14:57.566
Expenses at my new shop.

14:57.567 --> 14:59.848
Fonso's new shop.

14:59.849 --> 15:01.249
Of course.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.852
Our little secret.

15:07.390 --> 15:08.737
Sooner rather than later.

15:08.738 --> 15:10.435
There's something else.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.647
A request from Fonso.

15:15.785 --> 15:17.306
For his mother.

15:19.308 --> 15:20.629
Absolutely not!

15:20.630 --> 15:22.510
It's remarkable. He's changed.

15:22.511 --> 15:24.873
Ohh!
What's Fonso doing for money?

15:24.874 --> 15:28.436
He's an investor in real estate
and other major concerns.

15:28.437 --> 15:30.839
I am not going to ask the Council

15:30.840 --> 15:33.521
to call a kris to consider his return.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.668
What about tradition?

15:36.485 --> 15:40.048
Grandma,
you said tradition is all we have.

15:40.381 --> 15:43.131
Is it tradition
that LaLa not have a father?

15:43.132 --> 15:44.614
That I don't?

16:28.017 --> 16:29.699
Okay, okay.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.024
I am listening.

16:36.025 --> 16:38.667
I'm listening!

16:38.668 --> 16:40.590
Anyone?!

16:51.681 --> 16:53.563
There you are.

16:56.806 --> 16:59.544
None of my business, Ms. Marks.

17:00.129 --> 17:01.730
Oh, you found it.

17:01.731 --> 17:04.172
Yeah, it was a bitch

17:04.173 --> 17:08.136
to find a place open at 3:00
in the morning, but here it is.

17:08.137 --> 17:10.339
Thank you, Sharon.
Hm.

17:12.221 --> 17:16.503
You know, I never thought
I could feel like a friend

17:16.505 --> 17:18.667
to somebody... of your type.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.671
From Africa.

17:22.672 --> 17:24.953
I'm not from Africa. I'm from America.

17:24.954 --> 17:26.875
Whatever. You know what I mean.

17:26.876 --> 17:30.358
Hmm. I never thought
I could be cool with a Gypsy.

17:30.359 --> 17:32.120
Oh, no, we call ourselves Romani.

17:32.121 --> 17:33.281
Sit down. Sit down.

17:33.282 --> 17:35.123
Have a drink with me. Come on.

17:39.689 --> 17:41.009
How's your mother?

17:41.010 --> 17:43.131
Ohh.

17:43.132 --> 17:44.613
Chemo is hell.

17:44.614 --> 17:46.975
But, uh, she's a fighter.

17:46.976 --> 17:49.497
That's good to hear.
Mm-hmm.

17:49.498 --> 17:51.095
What about your son?

17:51.581 --> 17:53.542
Marcus, is it?

17:53.543 --> 17:56.184
Yeah, top 10 in his class in college.

17:56.185 --> 17:57.706
You must be very proud of him.

17:59.028 --> 18:00.909
Good Lord knows that I've screwed up

18:00.910 --> 18:02.831
more than a few things in my life,

18:02.832 --> 18:06.234
but, uh, Marcus isn't one of them.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.718
Here. To Marcus.

18:19.488 --> 18:22.418
I wish I could be proud of my son.

18:22.932 --> 18:25.880
But Fonso is driven by emotions.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.256
Just like his father was.

18:28.257 --> 18:30.092
Oh, worse.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.502
Fonso's a disaster.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.266
It wasn't always like this,
you know, before his wife died.

18:38.267 --> 18:42.751
At times, he was considerate and warm,

18:42.752 --> 18:46.555
but now he's all ego and anger and...

18:46.556 --> 18:50.078
Hm. Um, people change.

18:50.079 --> 18:53.441
And sometimes they can change back.

18:53.442 --> 18:54.450
Yeah.

18:55.164 --> 18:57.536
Change back to old tricks.

18:58.768 --> 19:00.650
Mm.

19:06.254 --> 19:08.577
Can I trust you, Sharon?

19:14.887 --> 19:18.506
You put your faith in me
when nobody else would.

19:18.808 --> 19:22.430
And where I come from,
that is an unbreakable bond.

19:25.394 --> 19:28.516
My family is surrounded by enemies.

19:28.517 --> 19:32.613
So far, I was able to be a step ahead.

19:33.948 --> 19:37.285
But I had to make very
difficult choices,

19:37.286 --> 19:40.088
all to protect my family.

19:40.089 --> 19:42.873
You know what I mean.
Mm-hmm.

19:44.333 --> 19:48.336
I need you to do
something dangerous for me.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.664
You just tell me where and when,
and I'll take care of it.

20:16.926 --> 20:18.406
You didn't return my calls.

20:18.407 --> 20:20.528
Someone must have hacked into my phone

20:20.529 --> 20:21.930
and erased all my messages.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.582
How's our old friend Paz?

20:25.583 --> 20:27.175
You haven't wished any ill on him,
have you?

20:27.176 --> 20:29.377
I would hate for that
to be on your conscience.

20:29.378 --> 20:31.059
Why? What's happened?

20:31.060 --> 20:35.463
Paz has gone on a spiritual
walkabout to find himself.

20:35.464 --> 20:36.785
He does this from time to time

20:36.786 --> 20:38.386
but never normally for this long.

20:38.387 --> 20:40.549
Sounds to me like your guru's
a bit of a flake.

20:40.550 --> 20:42.310
You're not entirely wrong.

20:42.311 --> 20:45.393
I'm hardly the first person
to find a charismatic flake

20:45.394 --> 20:47.916
and transform them
into a lucrative business.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.559
Was that before or after
you were drummed out

20:50.560 --> 20:52.882
of Madison Avenue for false advertising?

20:54.363 --> 20:55.844
Someone's been doing their homework.

20:55.845 --> 20:57.573
I took a page out of your book.

20:58.282 --> 21:00.288
My book is fucking "Ulysses."

21:00.289 --> 21:02.290
Plenty of pages to spare.

21:02.291 --> 21:05.093
For the first day or so,
I was racking my brain

21:05.094 --> 21:08.296
trying to figure out how
you and Paz pull off your con.

21:08.297 --> 21:09.979
And then I realized...

21:12.742 --> 21:14.783
Paz isn't in on it.

21:14.784 --> 21:17.305
He actually believes
he has a mystical gift,

21:17.306 --> 21:21.013
which means the only con artist is you.

21:22.390 --> 21:25.193
I like to think that
our background checks,

21:25.194 --> 21:28.877
our phone-data theft,
of which you are well aware,

21:28.878 --> 21:31.159
help bring our clients new insight.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.802
Ah, the justification of misdeeds.

21:34.235 --> 21:36.806
Am I taking a page out of your book now?

21:38.447 --> 21:41.890
Do you want to know why I had to
make false-advertising claims?

21:42.243 --> 21:43.732
To appease a client.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.855
Because every client wants you
to promise that their product

21:46.856 --> 21:49.497
will solve all their
consumers' problems.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.219
But it can't.

21:51.220 --> 21:54.663
A tube of toothpaste cannot fill
the hole in someone's soul.

21:54.664 --> 21:56.104
But a guru can.

21:56.105 --> 21:57.341
A good one.

21:58.008 --> 22:01.469
One who can cold-read a room
in the blink of an eye.

22:01.470 --> 22:04.032
Has a natural affinity with people

22:04.033 --> 22:06.915
and carries a certain moral flexibility

22:06.916 --> 22:08.396
not unlike my own.

22:08.397 --> 22:09.478
Huh.

22:10.279 --> 22:11.605
I'm flattered.

22:12.317 --> 22:13.882
But, no, thanks.

22:13.883 --> 22:16.685
Find some other sucker
you can try to manipulate.

22:16.686 --> 22:18.648
I'm not looking for a sucker.

22:21.337 --> 22:22.950
I'm looking for a partner.

22:23.492 --> 22:27.135
I've made some dubious
partnerships in my life.

22:27.136 --> 22:30.539
You have a singular talent,
Mr. Haverford.

22:30.540 --> 22:34.022
It is a shame you are
going to waste it here.

22:34.023 --> 22:35.383
Sorry.

22:35.384 --> 22:36.825
I'm nobody's product.

22:36.826 --> 22:40.148
You would rather fail
in this shitty mall

22:40.149 --> 22:42.551
with clients who cannot afford
your services

22:42.552 --> 22:44.597
than reach for the stars?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.515
I'm sure I do not have to remind you

22:47.516 --> 22:50.559
the price on a ticket
to one of Paz's retreats.

23:04.158 --> 23:06.174
For when you change your mind.

23:11.340 --> 23:13.061
It is time for another episode

23:13.062 --> 23:14.983
of "What's Happening With Charlie?"

23:16.345 --> 23:18.747
So, he's still experiencing insomnia?

23:18.748 --> 23:21.309
Well, not if you ask him.
But I'm seeing all the signs.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.792
I mean, ever since we got back,
and I hate to say it,

23:23.793 --> 23:27.676
but he is actually kind of normal.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.718
That's terrifying.
It kind of is.

23:29.719 --> 23:31.519
Here's the thing.

23:31.977 --> 23:36.484
You know, Charlie always plays
his cards close to the vest.

23:36.485 --> 23:38.567
Hmm. A little Vegas talk.

23:38.568 --> 23:39.808
Yeah. Ever been?

23:39.809 --> 23:40.819
No.

23:41.946 --> 23:43.371
Really?

23:43.656 --> 23:44.893
I'll have to take you.

23:44.894 --> 23:47.175
Doesn't sound very kid-friendly.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.657
Ah.

23:48.658 --> 23:50.138
Back in my day, it wasn't,

23:50.139 --> 23:52.621
but now it's like fucking
Disneyland in the desert.

23:54.343 --> 23:57.044
Well, I know you feel like
he's shut you out in the past.

23:58.147 --> 24:02.070
Well, the thing is, he's always
given me a peek at the cards,

24:02.071 --> 24:04.635
but now it's like
I don't even know who he is.

24:05.474 --> 24:07.636
Well, my ex was a bit like that.

24:07.637 --> 24:10.518
I suppose it's one
of the reasons we split up.

24:10.519 --> 24:12.280
I don't mean to imply
that you're gonna Sorry.

24:12.281 --> 24:13.802
No, no, no. Please.

24:13.803 --> 24:15.483
I mean,
the fact that we haven't split up -

24:15.484 --> 24:17.325
I think we're in it for the long haul.

24:17.326 --> 24:19.007
That's good. That makes me happy.

24:20.129 --> 24:22.250
You never talk about your ex.

24:22.778 --> 24:24.292
Eh, not much to talk about.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.975
Relationships are complicated.

24:27.491 --> 24:28.784
Yeah, no shit.

24:29.418 --> 24:30.619
Ugh.

24:30.620 --> 24:32.221
Whew!
I know.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.281
What do you want?

24:53.517 --> 24:55.003
How's the knee?

24:55.227 --> 24:58.326
Better. Thanks for asking.

24:58.647 --> 25:01.249
Well, Mrs. Marks has a message for you.

25:01.483 --> 25:03.972
She hasn't talked to the Council
yet on your behalf,

25:03.973 --> 25:05.894
but she has had a change of heart

25:05.895 --> 25:08.016
and wants LaLa to come back to her dojo

25:08.017 --> 25:09.908
as a sign of good faith.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.141
What?

25:15.344 --> 25:17.626
Daddy!
Ah, baby!

25:17.627 --> 25:18.667
Ohh!

25:18.668 --> 25:20.789
Hey, sweetheart!

25:20.790 --> 25:22.231
Welcome back!

25:25.090 --> 25:26.314
Drina.

25:26.315 --> 25:28.037
I'm going for a walk.

25:39.288 --> 25:42.130
Thanks.

25:42.131 --> 25:44.132
Hey.
Hey.

25:44.133 --> 25:46.414
Hi. You just hanging out
at your dad's mall, or...

25:46.415 --> 25:49.578
Um, more like hiding
from my evil mother-in-law,

25:49.579 --> 25:52.380
who's making me go
to a new school on Monday

25:52.381 --> 25:54.062
where I don't know anyone.

25:54.063 --> 25:55.704
Oh, which school?

25:55.705 --> 25:57.289
Muirwood.

25:58.248 --> 26:00.188
Well, at least you'll know someone.

26:00.189 --> 26:02.751
Oh. Shit. I'm sorry.

26:02.752 --> 26:04.994
No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine.

26:07.716 --> 26:09.998
Uh, you working at my dad's mall?

26:09.999 --> 26:13.222
Uh,
I'm helping my dad with his new shop.

26:13.603 --> 26:16.892
Let me guess. You're a psychic, too?

26:17.810 --> 26:20.209
Well, I'm just goofing around.

26:22.898 --> 26:24.853
I can give you a free reading,
if you'd like that.

26:24.854 --> 26:26.134
Goddamn right you're not.

26:26.135 --> 26:27.816
I know you must be out your mind!

26:27.817 --> 26:29.257
You couldn't fix a phone if your sad,

26:29.258 --> 26:31.059
pathetic life depended on it!

26:31.060 --> 26:33.622
Now get your black ass out
of here before I call the cops!

26:33.623 --> 26:35.344
Crazy old bastard!

26:38.956 --> 26:41.070
Hey, you touch it, you bought it.

27:06.536 --> 27:09.457
Make sure you get the security code.

27:23.352 --> 27:27.597
I'm no Warren Buffet,
but business looks good to me.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.119
Tenants are paying their rent.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.242
And with any luck,
Bob Fucking Caygeon won't.

27:34.243 --> 27:38.727
Then we can legally evict that
miserable, racist cocksucker.

27:38.728 --> 27:40.048
Yeah.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.329
He's an old fuck.

27:41.330 --> 27:43.131
It's a generational thing.

27:43.132 --> 27:45.093
Don't make it right, though.

27:45.094 --> 27:48.577
Can't teach an old dog new tricks,
you know?

27:48.578 --> 27:50.539
And he is an old dog.

27:50.540 --> 27:52.901
Mm-hmm.

27:52.902 --> 27:54.863
It's time to celebrate.

27:54.864 --> 27:56.985
I thought you were laying off the, uh...

27:56.986 --> 28:00.590
Nah. I get to be a dad again.

28:02.111 --> 28:05.994
Ma is letting LaLa
come back to our dojo.

28:05.995 --> 28:07.669
Your mother?

28:08.378 --> 28:10.799
Man,
she's a shark in a fancy black pantsuit.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.001
You can't trust her.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.179
Hey, I'm getting my littlest lady back.

28:18.764 --> 28:22.017
Karma's working for me,
so I'm paying it forward.

28:23.012 --> 28:24.814
Time to be a better man.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.690
I overstepped.

28:29.218 --> 28:31.068
Please accept my apology.

28:32.653 --> 28:34.404
You inspire me, Fonso.

28:35.344 --> 28:39.368
To new beginnings and being better men.

28:39.949 --> 28:40.949
Better men.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.488
I could ask, "Are you listening?"

29:00.489 --> 29:03.572
but what seems more appropriate is,
"Are you serious?"

29:03.573 --> 29:06.775
You should read a book
before judging it by its cover.

29:07.062 --> 29:08.817
And what a cover it is.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.379
You selling them to our clients?

29:11.380 --> 29:12.941
My clients.

29:13.235 --> 29:15.624
If they're interested, then, yes.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.385
How much you marking them up?

29:17.386 --> 29:19.948
A healthy 60%.

29:19.949 --> 29:22.071
There's the woman I know and love.

29:24.413 --> 29:26.314
I could do less if you prefer.

29:26.315 --> 29:29.397
I was thinking that 60%
was actually reasonable.

29:29.398 --> 29:30.919
How about 80%?

29:30.920 --> 29:33.242
How about you run your shop,
I'll run mine?

29:41.263 --> 29:42.681
I'm sorry.

29:43.891 --> 29:46.184
I'm not mad. I'm just...

29:48.177 --> 29:51.205
I'm worried, Charlie.

29:52.532 --> 29:54.904
I just wish you'd tell me
what's going on.

29:57.301 --> 29:59.067
They're gone.

29:59.068 --> 30:00.324
What?

30:01.390 --> 30:03.271
They're gone.

30:06.916 --> 30:08.476
They're gone?

30:11.240 --> 30:12.294
Yeah.

30:14.338 --> 30:16.006
Your vision things?

30:16.566 --> 30:18.634
I haven't had one in weeks.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.570
Since the retreat?

30:23.388 --> 30:24.653
Uh, maybe, I guess.

30:26.095 --> 30:27.455
Since Paz?

30:27.456 --> 30:30.498
Um, I can't be that sure.

30:33.462 --> 30:35.223
Come here.

30:42.952 --> 30:44.743
Where is he?

30:45.354 --> 30:47.245
Who? Paz?

30:48.455 --> 30:49.878
You know who.

31:16.425 --> 31:18.276
Want to do the honors?

31:18.988 --> 31:21.069
I think he'd want you to.

32:09.518 --> 32:11.039
Mateo's.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.831
I'm so proud of him.

32:13.915 --> 32:15.644
The instructor said that it's rare

32:15.645 --> 32:19.207
for someone LaLa's age
to skip an entire belt.

32:21.450 --> 32:23.925
She never ceases to amaze.

32:25.260 --> 32:27.896
Mateo's mother's uncoordinated.

32:27.897 --> 32:30.058
What's that?
Nothing.

32:32.381 --> 32:34.183
Excuse me.

32:37.627 --> 32:39.441
Jun-Bi.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.069
Hello?

32:43.070 --> 32:44.713
Mr. Caygeon.

32:44.714 --> 32:48.476
Yes, sir,
I'll I'll come straight over.

32:48.477 --> 32:50.760
I'll take a look. Yep, right now.

32:52.682 --> 32:54.723
Caygeon's land line's still fucked.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.484
Fonso.

32:56.485 --> 32:57.887
I'll get it.

33:00.049 --> 33:04.132
All that talk last night about
being better men inspired me.

33:04.133 --> 33:07.015
It's my turn to mediate, pay it forward,

33:07.016 --> 33:09.497
keep that...
you know, that good karma going.

33:09.498 --> 33:11.339
You sure?
You bet.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.502
Don't worry. I got this.

33:22.832 --> 33:26.274
This used to be a nice,
respectable neighborhood.

33:26.275 --> 33:29.317
Now it's filled to the rim
with immigrants,

33:29.318 --> 33:32.040
homos, and deadbeats.

33:35.044 --> 33:37.726
That dumb shit your Gypsy
boyfriend sent over

33:37.727 --> 33:39.127
didn't do fuck all.

33:39.128 --> 33:41.050
What the hell do you think you can do?

33:43.412 --> 33:46.975
You know, Alexander Graham Bell,
a goddamn American,

33:46.976 --> 33:48.617
invented the telephone.

33:48.618 --> 33:51.179
What the hell am I stuck with here?

33:51.180 --> 33:54.062
Dirty Sanchez from TJ
trying to fix mine.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.305
As a matter of fact,
my son was just learning

33:57.306 --> 34:00.108
about Alexander Graham Bell in school.

34:00.981 --> 34:03.271
I think he said the man
was born in Scotland

34:03.272 --> 34:05.394
and later emigrated to Canada.

34:06.515 --> 34:10.279
Well, at least he wasn't from Oaxaca.

34:15.605 --> 34:20.248
I have to go get my toolbox in
my office to get into this jack.

34:20.248 --> 34:23.772
I'll be back after
my son's belt ceremony.

34:23.773 --> 34:26.214
Oh,
I seen that kid strutting around here.

34:26.215 --> 34:28.976
You ask me,
you're gonna have to get a bigger belt

34:28.978 --> 34:30.978
for that little gordito pork chop.

34:37.466 --> 34:41.109
And just for the record,
I'm from East L. A., motherfucker!

34:45.313 --> 34:46.795
What's wrong?

34:46.795 --> 34:49.237
Mr. Caygeon and I
had a little disagreement.

34:49.237 --> 34:52.440
It's okay.
He's just got a bit of a headache.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.563
You assaulted a tenant!
He'll sue the shit out of us.

34:55.565 --> 34:58.366
I had no choice! He insulted Mateo!

34:58.367 --> 35:00.128
Karma be damned!

35:00.129 --> 35:01.850
Okay, okay.

35:01.851 --> 35:03.491
Replenish your electrolytes.

35:03.492 --> 35:04.773
We'll work it out.

35:04.774 --> 35:06.454
I was in the shit.
Oh, come on.

35:06.455 --> 35:09.417
I killed five VC sons
of bitches with my bare hands.

35:09.418 --> 35:12.500
I'll be goddamned if I let
any illegal immigrant

35:12.501 --> 35:14.262
attack me in my own shop!

35:14.263 --> 35:15.689
Jun-Bi!

35:17.098 --> 35:19.067
Now, there is a saying...

35:19.068 --> 35:23.713
Take no thought of who is right
and who is wrong.

35:24.954 --> 35:26.795
Oh, fuck that!

35:26.796 --> 35:29.277
What are you doing?
I'm calling the cops!

35:29.278 --> 35:31.399
My phone doesn't work, remember?!

35:31.400 --> 35:33.361
Wait. We can work this out.

35:33.362 --> 35:34.763
No, fuck you, fucker!

35:34.764 --> 35:36.524
Come on. Give it to me.
No!

35:36.525 --> 35:38.046
Give me that.

36:25.014 --> 36:28.136
Stop.

36:28.137 --> 36:31.499
He's out.

36:33.022 --> 36:34.262
He's not out.

36:38.027 --> 36:39.748
He's dead.

36:51.761 --> 36:53.803
You fucked up.

36:56.072 --> 36:57.607
So did you.

37:04.279 --> 37:05.575
So now what?

37:09.098 --> 37:12.060
Fuck! The belt ceremony.

37:12.061 --> 37:14.102
Shit, our kids are out there.

37:17.146 --> 37:18.907
This is not good.

37:18.908 --> 37:21.990
No shit this is not good.
What are we gonna do?

37:24.353 --> 37:26.555
Hide him.
He's bleeding out!

37:26.556 --> 37:28.598
We're not gonna be able
to clean it up in time.

37:36.613 --> 37:38.607
I got an idea.

37:38.948 --> 37:40.128
Come on.

37:40.450 --> 37:41.449
Wesley.

37:43.332 --> 37:44.693
Congratulations.

37:44.694 --> 37:46.535
Mateo.

37:49.458 --> 37:51.099
LaLa.

37:53.382 --> 37:55.064
Nicely done.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.148
Not bad, all things considered.

38:00.149 --> 38:01.790
Preston.

38:01.791 --> 38:05.153
So much for mediation.

38:05.642 --> 38:06.955
Sophia.

38:06.956 --> 38:09.718
As soon as it's dark,
we're gonna get rid of that fucker.

38:09.719 --> 38:11.319
Tresor.

38:22.331 --> 38:24.813
My car?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.335
What about your car?

38:27.336 --> 38:30.660
Yours has the most
interior space in its class.

39:02.451 --> 39:04.033
As promised.

39:04.614 --> 39:06.575
What's this?
My weekly contribution.

39:06.576 --> 39:08.096
Actually, it's last week's.

39:08.097 --> 39:10.178
I promise I'll have this week's
very shortly.

39:10.179 --> 39:13.742
Your lady friend came by
yesterday and paid your debt.

39:13.743 --> 39:16.384
My lady friend?
The foreigner.

39:16.385 --> 39:19.267
She said you'd understand.

39:19.268 --> 39:22.270
Oh, right. What...

39:22.271 --> 39:26.848
So, how does it feel to be a free man?

39:27.932 --> 39:29.142
Great.

39:30.143 --> 39:31.840
Thank you, Simza.

39:31.841 --> 39:34.202
Oh, please. No bullshit.

39:34.203 --> 39:37.286
See you around, gadje.

39:46.976 --> 39:50.859
At last you're returning my calls.

39:50.860 --> 39:53.261
Seems you did more to my phone
than just hack into it.

39:53.262 --> 39:54.903
Some kind of app or bot?

39:54.904 --> 39:56.665
Indeed.

39:56.666 --> 40:00.188
I'm on my way to your store now,
actually, to discuss next steps.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.150
I'm afraid I won't be seeing you.

40:02.151 --> 40:04.192
And your grand gesture
doesn't change a thing.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.074
I will be paying you back.

40:06.075 --> 40:07.596
What, all of it?

40:08.139 --> 40:10.759
I understand that's
a small fortune to you.

40:10.760 --> 40:13.001
To me, it's just a drop in a bucket...

40:13.002 --> 40:15.323
a bucket you and I could fill together.

40:15.324 --> 40:19.327
And like I told you,
I'm done carrying other people's water.

40:19.328 --> 40:21.010
Charlie. Char...

40:32.501 --> 40:34.343
Uh, can I have the room, please?

40:44.133 --> 40:48.557
This is the machine that's been
investigating your family,

40:48.558 --> 40:52.080
the Rankos, and the other
West Coast Roma crime families.

40:52.081 --> 40:54.242
A network of command centers.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.324
A dozen federal agents.

40:56.325 --> 41:00.288
And here's one of my favorites now.

41:00.289 --> 41:04.012
Agent Sims is our lead FBI investigator.

41:04.013 --> 41:05.253
This is...

41:05.254 --> 41:06.334
Rita Marks.

41:06.656 --> 41:07.977
I've read your file.

41:09.979 --> 41:11.995
Bit of a risk bringing her here.

41:13.162 --> 41:15.984
Rita loves her granddaughters a
little too much to say anything.

41:15.985 --> 41:17.385
I still think we should wire her.

41:17.386 --> 41:19.307
Oh, no, that wouldn't be necessary.

41:19.308 --> 41:20.508
Well, your level of future cooperation

41:20.509 --> 41:22.230
will determine all that.

41:22.231 --> 41:25.258
It appears Rita has finally
brought us something useful.

41:26.235 --> 41:29.437
Her son is running a psychic
call center out of a strip mall.

41:29.438 --> 41:31.720
Likely a front for interstate wire fraud

41:31.721 --> 41:32.961
and credit-card theft.

41:32.962 --> 41:35.244
I want to start surveillance.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.810
I know this guy.

41:41.811 --> 41:43.572
Eduardo Bustamante.

41:43.573 --> 41:45.574
We've had our eye on him
for something else.

41:45.575 --> 41:47.095
He wrapped up in this?

41:47.096 --> 41:48.658
Seems so.

41:51.060 --> 41:53.822
If Fonso Marks is working
with Bustamante,

41:53.823 --> 41:55.624
it must be something serious.

41:56.164 --> 41:57.385
We could use this.

41:57.386 --> 42:00.348
Except Fonso can't help us
bring down the crime families.

42:00.349 --> 42:02.211
He's banished.

42:03.112 --> 42:05.313
What if he wasn't?

42:10.760 --> 42:15.644
The Strength card represents
a woman with courage.

42:15.645 --> 42:17.325
You could be a diplomat.

42:17.326 --> 42:19.928
A diplomat? Really?

42:20.188 --> 42:21.522
Next card.

42:23.399 --> 42:24.893
The Empress.

42:24.894 --> 42:31.099
Okay, you have wealth,
a lot of things in abundance.

42:31.491 --> 42:34.102
The card represents motherhood
and pregnancy.

42:34.103 --> 42:37.163
The cards are totally wrong.
The cards don't lie.

42:37.627 --> 42:39.067
So you say.
They don't.

42:39.068 --> 42:40.708
Okay. Go on.

42:41.030 --> 42:42.911
The Lovers.

42:43.517 --> 42:45.954
Okay. This is where it gets interesting.

42:45.955 --> 42:48.116
You're interpreting the cards
however you want.

42:48.117 --> 42:50.679
No, I-I have...
I may have a little wiggle room,

42:50.680 --> 42:52.761
but the cards are what they are.

42:52.762 --> 42:56.244
The Lovers represents the
subconscious mind in a woman

42:56.245 --> 42:58.643
and the conscious in a man.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.229
That's typical.

43:02.852 --> 43:04.492
Let's skip this one.

43:05.815 --> 43:07.276
Uh...

43:08.337 --> 43:09.978
The Hierophant.

43:09.979 --> 43:14.262
So, you are captive to ritual,
religion, and servitude.

43:14.263 --> 43:17.465
This could be a family situation.

43:17.466 --> 43:20.228
Basically, what... what it means

43:20.229 --> 43:24.753
is you have a lot of things
you're supposed to obey.

43:24.754 --> 43:25.874
No shit.

43:25.875 --> 43:28.356
I'm a teen bride in a Roma family.

43:28.357 --> 43:30.358
See, that's what I'm saying.
The cards don't lie.

43:32.081 --> 43:34.554
Um, but what's interesting
about The Hierophant is...

43:35.763 --> 43:39.689
you can disobey if you want to.

43:42.211 --> 43:44.939
Do the cards tell you how to do that?

43:46.495 --> 43:47.536
If only.

43:59.108 --> 44:02.070
Drina. I didn't know you were here.

44:02.071 --> 44:04.072
I'm surprised to see you.

44:04.073 --> 44:06.755
Uh, could you help me with something?

44:06.756 --> 44:08.718
Okay.

44:12.802 --> 44:14.123
Be right back.

44:21.090 --> 44:23.572
What is she doing in our house?

44:23.573 --> 44:26.214
We're just hanging out, Mom. That okay?

44:26.215 --> 44:27.375
No, it's not okay.

44:27.376 --> 44:28.857
That's Fonso's daughter.

44:28.858 --> 44:31.259
She's married, Nick,
to Simza's oldest son,

44:31.260 --> 44:32.941
who is now the head of the crime family.

44:32.942 --> 44:34.863
If they knew that she was alone
in this house -

44:34.864 --> 44:36.449
What's the big deal?

44:38.107 --> 44:40.508
She's not allowed to hang out
with gadje like us.

44:40.509 --> 44:41.537
Mom.

44:42.632 --> 44:43.956
We're just friends.

44:45.082 --> 44:48.798
In case you haven't noticed,
I don't have many.

44:57.286 --> 44:58.526
I'll talk to him.

44:58.527 --> 45:00.368
You better.
He won't talk to me.

45:00.369 --> 45:02.090
It's not like they're dating
or going steady

45:02.091 --> 45:03.652
or whatever the fuck kids do these days.

45:03.653 --> 45:06.254
They're BFFs, whatever that means.

45:06.255 --> 45:07.776
I'll talk to him.

45:07.777 --> 45:09.858
Which reminds me,
why didn't you talk to me?

45:09.859 --> 45:11.459
What?
Today.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.022
I called you like six times
after the Drina incident.

45:14.023 --> 45:16.024
Oh, I need a new phone.

45:16.739 --> 45:18.947
Maybe I can get her to pay for it.

45:18.948 --> 45:20.589
Maggie?
Yeah.

45:20.590 --> 45:23.672
She, uh, wants to take my
talents to a larger audience.

45:23.673 --> 45:25.206
Does she?

45:26.082 --> 45:28.797
She paid off our debt to White T.

45:28.798 --> 45:30.837
Sort of a down payment on me.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.672
Sort of.

45:33.883 --> 45:35.364
I said no.

45:38.487 --> 45:40.409
You should have said yes.

45:43.172 --> 45:44.893
I can keep what's good for me

45:44.894 --> 45:47.056
separate from what's good for you.

45:48.778 --> 45:53.067
You have something,
Charles K. Haverford.

45:54.819 --> 45:56.545
If that's even your name.

46:35.064 --> 46:36.945
Hello.

46:39.549 --> 46:41.389
Hello?

46:45.635 --> 46:47.435
Hello?
