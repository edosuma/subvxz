02:17.757 --> 02:19.907
Oh bloody useless.
Just give me that

02:52.421 --> 02:54.221
I suppose we should cover her

02:57.321 --> 02:57.971
Yes

03:36.721 --> 03:38.621
Let's call an ambulance

03:39.371 --> 03:40.571
Right

04:12.021 --> 04:12.621
So?

04:12.721 --> 04:15.971
They're not a hurry I
told they she was dead

04:29.771 --> 04:32.371
- No eggs this morning?
- I forgot to buy eggs

04:49.721 --> 04:51.721
Get off

04:51.871 --> 04:54.221
Quick

05:01.421 --> 05:03.571
<i>That's good</i>

05:05.521 --> 05:07.421
You didn't see anything?

05:23.371 --> 05:26.721
Wait

05:32.121 --> 05:33.021
OK

06:03.621 --> 06:06.421
- What do the police think?
- The sergeant doesn't know

06:06.471 --> 06:09.071
It was not a murder, there
are no marks on the body

06:09.121 --> 06:10.921
You had a good look then

06:10.971 --> 06:14.221
You can't keep your eyes off
women even when she's dead

06:23.971 --> 06:26.621
I think she fell on water

06:27.721 --> 06:30.321
So how do you explain
she was half naked?

06:31.821 --> 06:34.021
May be she was drunk

06:34.721 --> 06:37.771
May be she wander
on boats or something

06:38.221 --> 06:40.471
May be she was pregnant

06:42.721 --> 06:44.071
Right

07:01.671 --> 07:04.221
Don't worry, it's
just the drink

07:13.271 --> 07:15.521
What do you think, Joe?

07:15.871 --> 07:18.471
- About what?
- The dead

07:22.171 --> 07:24.621
I think she went to
the bridge fully dressed

07:25.821 --> 07:28.421
To breath the warm night air

07:29.721 --> 07:33.221
Then she took off her jacket
and put it on the ground

07:34.371 --> 07:36.721
And then she
unbuttoned her blouse

07:38.471 --> 07:40.921
And then she lifted
up her brassieres

07:41.471 --> 07:43.971
And dropped it down on
top of other clothes

07:46.521 --> 07:50.671
An she undone button of her skirt,
and it slipped down over her hips.

07:52.636 --> 07:55.186
Then she undone her stockings

07:55.570 --> 08:00.270
And hold them up so they blew in the breeze
before she let them flew off into the night

08:02.821 --> 08:04.771
And she shivered

08:05.021 --> 08:07.521
She wondered if she
really wanted to do it

08:07.621 --> 08:10.621
She answered this question by
kicking her clothes into the river

08:10.921 --> 08:13.871
And horridly now she take off
her garter and her knickers

08:14.771 --> 08:17.421
And there she be,
standing in a petticoat

08:17.456 --> 08:20.121
Thinking over what
brought her to this

08:23.371 --> 08:26.021
And the with
particle below her

08:26.571 --> 08:28.371
She dropped into
the river like a rose

08:29.371 --> 08:31.271
And float there for a moment

08:32.221 --> 08:33.971
And begone

08:37.821 --> 08:40.471
What kind of
women would do that?

08:40.506 --> 08:42.520
Just an ordinary woman

08:44.421 --> 08:47.171
You are going to sit
there all day drinking tea?

09:04.121 --> 09:05.271
Hi

09:09.621 --> 09:12.471
Sign here and don't dirt it

09:17.621 --> 09:19.621
You are the one
who found the girl?

09:20.771 --> 09:22.071
Right

09:22.871 --> 09:25.021
There are evil
men in this town

09:55.771 --> 09:59.421
- How come you get so little water?
- Shut your mouth

10:03.571 --> 10:05.371
Come on, Jim. This way

10:37.671 --> 10:40.021
There's a good pub in Leers.

10:40.821 --> 10:42.971
We should go there
for a game of darts

10:43.371 --> 10:44.071
Right

11:54.671 --> 11:56.521
Joe challange me to
a game of darts.

11:58.121 --> 12:00.771
- You play darts?
- Sometimes

12:00.821 --> 12:02.671
Just to pass the time

12:03.071 --> 12:06.021
You don't find anything more
interesting to spend the time?

12:06.121 --> 12:09.071
I can tell one or two thing
but not in front of a kid

12:10.121 --> 12:12.071
Don't you laugh to yourself

12:12.721 --> 12:15.571
- What is so funny?
- Eat your potato.

12:20.121 --> 12:21.521
All of it

13:35.571 --> 13:39.671
- Don't kick me, mom
- Stop yelling

13:43.571 --> 13:45.321
You finished, Joe?

14:53.021 --> 14:56.371
May be they'll say something in the
evening newspapers about that body

14:57.371 --> 14:59.271
Do you think they'll
write about us?

14:59.671 --> 15:00.521
No

15:04.171 --> 15:08.021
Myself and Joe picked up a
body from the river this morning

15:08.571 --> 15:11.221
- Naked
- Murder

15:11.321 --> 15:13.821
Possible. She
had no clothes on

15:13.871 --> 15:16.671
- Was she cut?
- Not a mark on her

15:17.571 --> 15:18.571
Here we are

15:19.821 --> 15:23.671
A body of a dead woman was found
in the River Clay this morning

15:23.706 --> 15:26.321
The woman was wearing
only a thin petticoat

15:26.371 --> 15:28.436
So far she was unidentified

15:28.471 --> 15:30.921
- Police...
- You said she was naked

15:30.956 --> 15:33.371
The same thing,
it was transparent

15:33.421 --> 15:36.271
Les, I've got a headache,
I'm going back to the barge

15:36.306 --> 15:38.971
- Another game of darts?
- Another time

15:40.821 --> 15:42.521
I'll give you a game

16:10.671 --> 16:12.171
Where's Les?

16:13.821 --> 16:16.271
He's found someone
to play darts with

16:19.771 --> 16:22.071
He'll be here at least an hour

16:37.621 --> 16:39.021
We'll wake the boy

16:41.521 --> 16:43.371
Why don't we go up on deck?

17:02.271 --> 17:04.471
I'm not going any further

18:20.921 --> 18:23.421
Police are
investigating that woman

18:24.637 --> 18:26.687
There's a bit in the
newspaper about its

18:32.675 --> 18:34.825
What makes you think of that?

18:36.299 --> 18:38.199
Something to say

18:40.549 --> 18:42.549
You have done enough
talking for one night

18:44.799 --> 18:46.299
Are you sorry?

18:47.349 --> 18:49.349
That's not good, do we?

19:05.449 --> 19:07.249
It's pity if he's coming back

19:08.049 --> 19:08.749
What?

19:10.299 --> 19:12.699
It's pity if he's coming back

19:14.899 --> 19:16.799
The bunk there

19:22.299 --> 19:24.099
You're nice, Joe

19:32.799 --> 19:35.799
You hungry? I'll
fry you an egg

19:36.599 --> 19:39.449
No, not now

19:39.499 --> 19:41.149
I'll take a cup of tea though

20:13.649 --> 20:17.499
- You two are bloody quiet
- Same as you, no?

20:17.599 --> 20:19.749
- What's up Les?
- I know fine well what's up

20:19.949 --> 20:23.749
He's lost money at darts again. And he
came back here to try to take out at me

20:23.799 --> 20:26.499
- Listen woman...
- You shut your damned mouth, Leslie Gold!

20:26.549 --> 20:28.149
You have no rights
to yell at me

20:28.399 --> 20:31.049
I have never lost
money at darts

20:31.084 --> 20:32.499
You are a liar!

20:41.349 --> 20:43.849
- Tea is ready?
- You in a hurry?

20:43.884 --> 20:46.349
The tea is ready
when it's ready

20:49.749 --> 20:52.099
You read that they
wrote in the papers

20:52.799 --> 20:55.014
They didn't mention about us

20:55.049 --> 20:57.449
I am not really
interested in any of that

23:08.749 --> 23:11.499
- Have you been swimming?
- I don't swim

23:17.199 --> 23:18.499
How about you?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.949
I don't have a
swimming costume

23:27.099 --> 23:28.799
You are here on holiday?

23:29.299 --> 23:31.249
It's free day today

23:35.999 --> 23:37.349
What's your name?

23:40.008 --> 23:41.008
Cathie

23:45.049 --> 23:47.749
Would you like to go with
me for a walk, Cathie?

23:49.299 --> 23:51.299
Where to?

23:52.649 --> 23:54.199
Over there

25:30.299 --> 25:32.199
Tim's over board!

25:34.049 --> 25:36.199
The boy is
overboard, Ella. Help

25:48.599 --> 25:51.449
- You alright?
- Right

26:15.949 --> 26:17.099
Thank you.

26:18.525 --> 26:19.825
Thanks, Joe

26:34.449 --> 26:38.549
- Look at that
- A funfair. Can we go there?

26:38.599 --> 26:40.849
You can ask your mom

26:50.599 --> 26:51.899
Ella. Look at that

26:53.799 --> 26:56.099
May be we go there with Tim?

26:56.799 --> 27:00.749
- I've my work to do. You take him
- I'll stay aboard if you want to go

27:01.949 --> 27:04.099
I have no time. You go

27:05.399 --> 27:08.949
Come along, Joe?
Stretch for your legs

27:09.899 --> 27:11.399
Yes, all right

27:22.399 --> 27:24.399
Here we are

27:25.399 --> 27:27.249
Watch me

27:30.599 --> 27:34.099
- Yes, yes, that one!
- Got it

27:34.134 --> 27:35.499
2 pence.

27:35.749 --> 27:37.499
You see, I always win

27:38.099 --> 27:40.049
How do you like it, son?

27:41.899 --> 27:44.949
- And that's it
- You are touching the line, sorry

27:45.049 --> 27:48.499
- Excuse me, I was not touching the line
- You touched the line

27:52.399 --> 27:54.914
What are you doing here?

27:54.949 --> 27:58.149
- I'm working here now
- Right, right, Bob. This is Joe Huggy.

27:58.184 --> 27:59.766
He works with us
couple of months

27:59.801 --> 28:01.314
- Nice to meet you, Joe.
- Me too

28:01.349 --> 28:04.799
Me and Les, we used to
work on the same boat

28:04.849 --> 28:07.049
- Never the same shipyard
- No

28:07.299 --> 28:09.849
- That was good time?
- Yes

28:10.199 --> 28:11.949
2 pence.

28:12.449 --> 28:14.414
Bob, here is my son, Jim.

28:14.449 --> 28:17.349
- Jim, this is Bob.
- We close the game

28:17.449 --> 28:20.464
<i>I don't want to go
back to the barge</i>

28:20.499 --> 28:23.699
Do you want to go to the picture?
There are two of them in town

28:23.734 --> 28:25.516
- Do you want to go to the picture?
- Yae

28:25.551 --> 28:27.264
Joe, do you want to
go to the picture?

28:27.299 --> 28:30.799
No, no. I'll walk into town
then go back to the barge

28:31.299 --> 28:33.249
Let make it quick

28:55.449 --> 28:58.399
Go, Joe. I don't
want to see you

28:59.299 --> 29:00.749
Go

29:17.699 --> 29:20.649
Look what you've done

29:24.149 --> 29:25.849
Give it to me

29:38.349 --> 29:40.249
It's broken

30:53.299 --> 30:54.849
Hello, Joe.

30:55.049 --> 30:56.299
Hello, Cathie.

30:59.199 --> 31:00.849
What are you doing here?

31:03.349 --> 31:06.899
- I'm working here by the river
- You are working?

31:07.299 --> 31:10.449
Joe Taylor condescend to
mix with the working class?

31:10.899 --> 31:12.899
I don't take any pride in it

31:15.749 --> 31:18.649
I see you never
made it to China

31:22.549 --> 31:25.599
- Your flat is still there?
- Yes

31:26.249 --> 31:28.549
I've got a flat mate now

31:29.399 --> 31:31.299
Is she nice?

31:31.449 --> 31:33.199
I don't see her much

31:35.949 --> 31:38.299
Why barge, Joe?

31:38.849 --> 31:41.599
You can find work
more glamorous

31:43.099 --> 31:45.399
Just sort of have it, really

31:46.899 --> 31:50.549
- What about you, you still at the office?
- Yes

31:52.849 --> 31:55.149
Nothing's really changed

31:56.399 --> 31:58.299
Except us

32:06.249 --> 32:09.649
- What did you do with all my stuff?
- I threw them away

32:10.899 --> 32:13.099
As you told me to

32:14.999 --> 32:17.099
I thought I would
never see you again

35:39.999 --> 35:43.599
- Hi gentlemen
- Go, Joe.

35:44.949 --> 35:47.599
- You sure?
- I'm scaling a little

35:47.634 --> 35:49.949
It'll get hot in an hour

37:05.099 --> 37:07.199
Joe, get some sacs of coal

37:15.249 --> 37:19.149
- Tim!
- Easy said than done

37:19.699 --> 37:21.499
We continue?

37:22.099 --> 37:24.099
Put it in the back
of the truck, Joe.

37:24.749 --> 37:27.099
- It's in your truck now
- Thanks

37:27.499 --> 37:29.449
What about the boy

37:30.049 --> 37:33.949
- Will you come to see him?
- He'll be back in school again next week

37:35.699 --> 37:38.399
I have some surprise for you

37:40.249 --> 37:41.449
A banana!

37:41.649 --> 37:44.249
- What should you say?
- Thank you, uncle Sam.

37:46.799 --> 37:49.349
- Thanks
- Will you talk about the naked lady?

37:49.599 --> 37:53.099
- Yes, some pervert has done it
- Me and Joe found her

37:53.134 --> 37:55.549
- You're joking
- We called the police

37:55.599 --> 37:57.549
Will you stop
talking about this?

37:57.799 --> 37:59.799
All talk about it

38:38.749 --> 38:41.099
Drink your tea

39:08.749 --> 39:10.199
Say bye to your dad

39:10.349 --> 39:12.999
- Bye, dad
- Bye, son. Take care of yourself

39:18.449 --> 39:20.449
- Take care
- Bye

40:00.349 --> 40:02.849
You're sad about Tim?

40:04.499 --> 40:07.399
He needs an education.

40:08.649 --> 40:12.499
But when he goes
away It breaks my heart

42:14.249 --> 42:18.149
<i>Think of me when you look at
yourself. With undying love, C.</i>

42:23.599 --> 42:26.099
I had a dream
about you yesterday

42:27.249 --> 42:29.799
I don't think for months

42:31.999 --> 42:35.099
- I think you have gone away
- I had gone away

42:35.899 --> 42:38.699
I shed my own skin
and hide in the fog

42:41.199 --> 42:43.149
I am pregnant

42:44.149 --> 42:45.499
It's yours

42:47.849 --> 42:49.299
Two months has gone

42:52.549 --> 42:56.999
- Two months and you wanted me out of your life?
- This isn't going to happen

42:57.999 --> 43:00.449
Is there anything you
want me to do about it?

43:02.099 --> 43:04.649
I just thought
you should know who

43:07.749 --> 43:11.199
You could marry me and we'll
make wonderful babies together

43:13.199 --> 43:15.049
Kid is not exactly I see it

43:15.599 --> 43:18.064
Why not, Joe? What
are you afraid of?

43:18.099 --> 43:22.099
There's a kid in the barge and I spent every
moment I want to kick him out of the sight

43:22.799 --> 43:25.049
You don't have to be like that
We'll work out intelligently

43:25.149 --> 43:26.814
It's not about us

43:26.849 --> 43:29.599
It's about what
kids do to people

43:30.649 --> 43:34.149
Cathie, I am not someone you
want to marry and you know that

43:44.049 --> 43:46.749
- Have you been seeing anyone else?
- It's your child, Joe.

43:46.784 --> 43:48.949
That doesn't
answer my question

43:53.149 --> 43:55.299
His name is Dan,
he's a plumber

43:57.049 --> 43:59.849
He's nice but I'm not
really interested in him

43:59.899 --> 44:02.499
- He's married anyway
- That's why you said it's mine

44:02.549 --> 44:04.499
It's the truth

44:05.649 --> 44:07.449
I have to get
back to the barge

44:07.599 --> 44:10.099
Don't run away, we can
sort it out together

44:10.149 --> 44:12.324
No, we can't. I'm
not yours anymore

44:12.359 --> 44:14.499
That's not true

44:14.949 --> 44:17.124
We were right,
we were fearless

44:17.351 --> 44:18.351
I was... then.
I have to go

44:20.749 --> 44:22.714
But Joe, what about the baby?

44:22.749 --> 44:24.814
I'll send some money
when I have some

44:24.849 --> 44:26.749
I looked after you
for more than two years

44:26.799 --> 44:28.799
You owe me more...

44:28.834 --> 44:30.799
Bye, Cathie.

47:13.199 --> 47:16.299
- Joe, do you want to get on? - No,
I'll see you at the next lock. - All right.

47:43.299 --> 47:44.999
Look at that, Joe

47:46.099 --> 47:49.499
Daniel Gordon, plumber
of 26 years old in Glasgow

47:49.549 --> 47:52.899
was in custody charged with
murder of Catherine Dimly,

47:52.934 --> 47:54.249
A future actress

47:54.299 --> 47:56.749
Dimly's body was
discovered 2 weeks ago

47:56.799 --> 47:59.849
by two bargemen where they
recovered it from the River Clay

48:00.499 --> 48:02.699
They'll hang that men for sure

48:04.149 --> 48:06.599
Well, we're going to celebrate

48:06.649 --> 48:09.949
Not every day I'm
mentioned in the papers

48:25.449 --> 48:26.999
Here, Joe.

49:07.549 --> 49:10.849
- Joe, I'm going for a beer. Do you want to come?
- No, I'll finish this

49:11.599 --> 49:12.699
Serve yourself

49:12.949 --> 49:15.449
- I see you later
- See you later, Les

49:41.849 --> 49:43.849
Ella. Les will be
back in a minute

49:45.649 --> 49:48.049
He's always late

49:52.949 --> 49:55.349
You scared now?

50:40.449 --> 50:42.649
Do you think he knows?

50:45.049 --> 50:47.249
Of course he does

51:11.399 --> 51:13.799
How long he's been out there?

51:14.999 --> 51:17.349
He must come down and see us

51:21.149 --> 51:22.949
What can we do?

51:23.899 --> 51:26.149
It depends on him really

51:27.799 --> 51:30.349
Why it only depends on him?

51:31.399 --> 51:33.749
There's... anyhow

51:33.849 --> 51:36.149
He surveys the boat as
if it prepared judgment

51:36.199 --> 51:38.299
It's just his way of
knowing we're there

51:38.334 --> 51:40.149
Yes, he's done that

51:48.199 --> 51:50.649
You're just gonna lie here?

51:51.249 --> 51:54.899
There's no hurry.
I finish my cigarette.

52:57.949 --> 52:59.749
I'm sorry, Les

53:01.899 --> 53:04.149
It just happened

53:04.999 --> 53:07.399
There's nothing
personal against you

53:10.299 --> 53:12.999
I just kick you fucking head

53:14.899 --> 53:18.699
I won't fight you, Les. Hit me if
you think it'll make you feel better

53:24.949 --> 53:27.649
What about my son?

53:28.649 --> 53:32.099
What do you think happens to my
son when you are fucking my wife?

53:32.134 --> 53:34.749
- It wasn't like that
- Like what, Joe?

53:36.349 --> 53:38.199
Tell me what it was like

53:40.699 --> 53:42.449
Look, I'll get my stuff

53:42.649 --> 53:46.599
- I leave you to sort it out with Ella.
- This hard fucking barge!

53:50.249 --> 53:52.499
I'll go

54:03.749 --> 54:05.949
So he'll write me a letter?

54:08.149 --> 54:10.299
That's what he said

54:10.399 --> 54:12.399
Do you want a cup of tea?

54:12.799 --> 54:15.699
- Right, I'll do this one
- Me too

54:18.749 --> 54:21.199
Look what we said before
to each other, Joe.

55:59.149 --> 56:00.649
Stop!

56:00.749 --> 56:02.549
Stop! I don't like it. Joe

56:03.349 --> 56:05.849
I can't swim.
You know it. Stop!

56:06.249 --> 56:09.399
I'm scared, I'm
scared, bastard

56:35.649 --> 56:38.349
They've set the
date for that man's trial

56:53.649 --> 56:56.149
FATHER OF TWO TO STAND TRIAL

56:57.399 --> 56:59.199
I thought 4 he has

56:59.299 --> 57:02.799
- What?
- Children. 4 kids

57:03.249 --> 57:05.399
Yes, so did I. It
must be a mistake

57:07.049 --> 57:09.899
Push out the paper

57:14.449 --> 57:16.099
Poor bastard

57:16.299 --> 57:18.614
How? He killed
an innocent woman

57:18.649 --> 57:21.199
You are not the
judge, he didn't do it

57:21.234 --> 57:23.199
What makes you say it?

57:24.099 --> 57:27.199
- It was an accident
- Not what they think

57:27.599 --> 57:30.099
She died without her clothes
so it must be a murder?

57:30.449 --> 57:33.849
Do you want to know how
I know it was an accident?

57:33.899 --> 57:35.949
I thought you were not
interested in all that

57:39.449 --> 57:41.099
I know

59:16.599 --> 59:18.499
I came for my stuff

59:18.799 --> 59:19.949
I'll get it

59:30.649 --> 59:33.149
- How is Jim?
- You know how he is

59:33.399 --> 59:35.299
Go and see him yourself

59:36.399 --> 59:40.299
I thought he was coming
Stay with me for a while

59:51.349 --> 59:54.049
- You want a cup of tea?
- You've got work to do

01:00:01.049 --> 01:00:03.599
They asked me as a
witness at the trial

01:00:04.199 --> 01:00:06.049
One of us is enough

01:00:06.749 --> 01:00:09.799
I cannot tell
them anymore anyway

01:00:12.999 --> 01:00:16.649
- You'll say hello to the boy for me?
- Go and see him

01:00:34.499 --> 01:00:36.299
We need to find a lawyer

01:00:37.499 --> 01:00:39.949
To make things proper again

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:56.149
Les said we have no future

01:00:56.749 --> 01:00:58.949
He said once the
ration fuel stops

01:00:58.984 --> 01:01:01.399
The truck will take over

01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:03.849
But that doesn't bother me

01:01:04.199 --> 01:01:05.999
I've spent my
life on the barges

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.699
When we save enough
money, if you wish

01:01:12.749 --> 01:01:15.799
There is a nice bungalow at
the quiet side of Edinburgh

01:01:16.349 --> 01:01:18.049
Wouldn't take
long, would it, Joe?

01:01:19.649 --> 01:01:21.899
- What?
- The divorce

01:01:24.249 --> 01:01:26.949
I don't know, Ella I don't
know about such things

01:01:28.599 --> 01:01:32.149
It will be easier when
Jim's bigger, the three of us

01:01:41.249 --> 01:01:42.314
Say hello to Joe

01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:44.349
- All right
- Bastard!

01:01:44.749 --> 01:01:47.099
Mind you langue!

01:02:14.499 --> 01:02:17.449
Your wage. Tax deducted

01:02:45.399 --> 01:02:46.749
Board!

01:02:52.999 --> 01:02:54.449
Some more

01:02:58.999 --> 01:03:00.099
Stay ahead

01:03:42.249 --> 01:03:45.499
- What's matter?
- It's Sam, my sister's husband

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:51.099
There has been un accident.
He felt out the lorry, he was killed

01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:56.649
It's about a week,
I just got a letter

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.949
I sent her a telegram
saying we'll visit her

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:19.249
I see you have a new boyfriend

01:04:19.749 --> 01:04:23.399
This is Joe. We're
going to be married

01:04:23.449 --> 01:04:27.099
You have to excuse me not being
dressed I was not expecting visitors

01:04:27.192 --> 01:04:29.057
Hello, auntie Gwen.

01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:39.449
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- I'll help you

01:04:39.999 --> 01:04:41.149
Come on, Jim.

01:05:26.749 --> 01:05:29.399
Gwen will come to
barge for a week or two

01:05:29.699 --> 01:05:31.749
Hope you don't mind, Joe?

01:05:32.849 --> 01:05:35.799
Don't want to
spoil your honeymoon

01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:41.499
That'll be good for her

01:05:44.449 --> 01:05:48.649
She doesn't drink. Can't
understand people who don't drink

01:05:48.849 --> 01:05:50.924
If I don't drink
in the morning

01:05:50.959 --> 01:05:52.999
I'll be drunk the whole day

01:05:53.599 --> 01:05:55.299
Gin's my drink

01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:58.499
Not gin in lemonade

01:05:58.649 --> 01:06:00.199
Just gin straight

01:06:00.599 --> 01:06:03.199
Some people find it
a bit odd but not me

01:06:05.749 --> 01:06:08.249
We should get a drink sometimes

01:06:08.499 --> 01:06:09.849
Tonight?

01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:13.349
We can tell Ella
we go to the cinema

01:06:16.049 --> 01:06:19.699
There's one thing I hate
that's going to the dentists

01:06:20.799 --> 01:06:22.849
You sure you don't mind, Ella?

01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:25.699
- I want to go to the picture
- No, you go

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:28.749
Someone has to stay
and look after the barge

01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:31.899
You enjoy yourself

01:06:34.499 --> 01:06:36.199
See you later, Ella

01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:46.299
Of course I'm sorry for Sam

01:06:46.334 --> 01:06:48.749
One did not want it to happen

01:06:49.199 --> 01:06:51.114
I didn't have time
to think a lot though

01:06:51.149 --> 01:06:54.399
We had to bury him as soon as possible
when the bus killed him

01:06:54.849 --> 01:06:57.749
I thought he
fell off the lorry

01:06:57.799 --> 01:06:59.699
Yes he did. Then
the bus ran him over

01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:12.599
It's about time Ella will look
after ourselves how she is doing

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:30.099
One of your girlfriends?

01:07:31.049 --> 01:07:33.999
- Yes, she died
- You still carry her photo

01:07:35.499 --> 01:07:37.349
Yes, I don't know why

01:07:38.399 --> 01:07:41.349
- I should have get rid of it long time ago
- Of course you should

01:07:41.649 --> 01:07:44.149
The dead can't
look after themselves

01:07:48.949 --> 01:07:52.749
Drink your cup, we have
business to attend to

01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:20.999
Look at the mess
you've made me

01:08:45.698 --> 01:08:47.849
Right, that's me

01:08:49.099 --> 01:08:51.349
See you love birds
in the morning

01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:39.448
Leave me alone, Joe

01:09:58.949 --> 01:10:00.699
He killed her,
as simple as that

01:10:00.734 --> 01:10:02.414
We'll see what
the judge will say

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:05.499
- The law warranty the justice.
- Yes

01:10:05.849 --> 01:10:08.599
You want to know what I thing
of this so-called justice?

01:10:08.634 --> 01:10:12.599
Lawyers only play words...

01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:15.099
This bastard should be hung!

01:10:15.249 --> 01:10:17.949
I agree. If this guy is
guilty he has to be hung

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.899
Calm

01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:40.999
Hi there

01:10:48.499 --> 01:10:51.699
- I suppose you did any writing today?
- Not much

01:10:52.199 --> 01:10:55.399
I know you 're
going to finish it

01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:57.149
You think it's easy?

01:10:57.249 --> 01:10:59.299
I'm trying to do something
different, don't you understand?

01:10:59.349 --> 01:11:01.999
- I'm trying something new
- No, I don't understand

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:06.399
Why can't you write an ordinary book?
What other people can't understand

01:11:07.499 --> 01:11:11.349
For 8 months I'm been getting
enough sitting in the lousy office

01:11:11.399 --> 01:11:13.764
And when I get home
there is a drunker asleep

01:11:13.799 --> 01:11:16.699
What have you done today
to earn enough money for us to eat?

01:11:16.734 --> 01:11:18.799
- I made some custard
- You did what?

01:11:18.849 --> 01:11:20.249
I made some custard

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.309
Custard?

01:11:22.099 --> 01:11:24.549
I worked whole day
and you made some custard

01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:27.349
Yes it tricked me a
good idea, so I made some

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:30.149
- It's over here, on the dresser
- Put it where you like

01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:32.314
Eat it yourself
Taste your custard

01:11:32.349 --> 01:11:34.699
I put a lot of effort in this
custard and you're going to eat it

01:11:34.949 --> 01:11:37.849
- No, you can't do it
- Oh I know I'm going to do it

01:11:41.949 --> 01:11:43.449
You... you are a bastard

01:11:43.649 --> 01:11:45.999
You bastard

01:13:53.099 --> 01:13:55.699
He should serve enough time

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:58.299
Pervert like that
should be fucked

01:13:58.799 --> 01:14:00.399
Hanging, it is too easy

01:14:00.949 --> 01:14:03.749
If he is guilty, he should die

01:14:03.799 --> 01:14:05.399
That's what they say

01:15:27.099 --> 01:15:29.549
- When's your birthday, Joe?
- What?

01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:33.199
- It's horoscope, I read it for you
- Where's Ella?

01:15:33.299 --> 01:15:35.499
Elle's gone.
Come and sit down

01:15:35.549 --> 01:15:37.599
What do you mean
Ella's gone darts?

01:15:37.649 --> 01:15:39.549
Elle's gone to see Les.

01:15:44.249 --> 01:15:45.749
What you think you're doing?

01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:49.749
I'm leaving

01:15:50.749 --> 01:15:52.999
Should have done
it long time ago

01:16:09.049 --> 01:16:10.999
You are going anywhere?

01:16:11.749 --> 01:16:15.099
No, I'm leaving
looking for another job

01:16:16.849 --> 01:16:19.199
You're looking for
somewhere to stay?

01:16:19.449 --> 01:16:20.699
Suppose I am?

01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:24.699
- I'll find you a lodger
- I'm not going to stay for long

01:16:24.734 --> 01:16:26.099
May be a month

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.899
- Well, interested?
- Yes, how much?

01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:33.099
10 schillings a week I'll
introduce you to my wife

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.749
I work at night. You'll
see her more than me

01:16:39.899 --> 01:16:41.849
You have to pay in advance.

01:16:50.899 --> 01:16:53.199
Your room is there

01:16:53.449 --> 01:16:55.249
I go to work

01:16:56.599 --> 01:16:58.049
I see you in the morning

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.199
See you later

01:17:10.049 --> 01:17:11.099
Daddy!

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:36.399
I suppose you 're
our last lodger

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.699
Get up, he'll be here soon

01:18:08.049 --> 01:18:10.999
There were the bargemen who
found her body, isn't it?

01:18:13.099 --> 01:18:15.149
- Anyone you know?
- What?

01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:18.649
- The bargemen. Did you know them?
- I knew one of them

01:18:21.249 --> 01:18:23.199
You have been in a trial?

01:18:23.249 --> 01:18:25.399
- No. You?
- No

01:18:25.949 --> 01:18:27.849
I don't want to, either

01:18:28.649 --> 01:18:30.499
I think I might go along to it

01:18:31.199 --> 01:18:33.399
Just to see what
it like, you know

01:19:04.499 --> 01:19:07.349
Pencils? Give me
small something

01:19:14.849 --> 01:19:18.099
How do you describe your
relationship with the deceased?

01:19:18.949 --> 01:19:22.849
We were flat mates, but I don't
know I recently moved in so...

01:19:23.299 --> 01:19:26.199
we were friendly
rather than friends

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:29.699
And what do you know her
relationship with the accused?

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:33.599
I think she met him when he
came to fix plumbing in the flat

01:19:33.999 --> 01:19:35.899
I only saw him once, so

01:19:36.049 --> 01:19:38.199
couldn't really form an opinion

01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:40.999
But I know she was lonely

01:19:41.449 --> 01:19:43.949
Her last boyfriend
recently has gone to China

01:19:44.449 --> 01:19:46.749
Thank you

01:20:01.949 --> 01:20:05.149
You should have been rich Joe,
it might have work then

01:20:07.399 --> 01:20:08.849
I loved you

01:20:11.549 --> 01:20:13.299
Will you write to me?

01:20:15.299 --> 01:20:17.249
I'll send you a
letter from China

01:20:20.599 --> 01:20:23.799
- You are not going to China
- May be I am

01:20:30.549 --> 01:20:32.249
I'm sorry

01:20:37.849 --> 01:20:39.749
What's to be sorry about?

01:20:41.299 --> 01:20:42.599
It happens

01:20:47.449 --> 01:20:48.799
We ran our course

01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:08.649
Goodbye, Joe

01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:44.599
What you do that for?

01:21:45.899 --> 01:21:48.049
I've no use for that

01:21:48.799 --> 01:21:52.449
- Must be worth something, no?
- Not to me

01:21:54.049 --> 01:21:55.949
I saw him with her

01:21:56.499 --> 01:22:00.349
I recognize his face

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:03.649
Thank you. No
further questions.

01:22:03.749 --> 01:22:07.399
I'd like to call
Mr. Leslie Gold.

01:22:19.599 --> 01:22:21.699
Can you please describe
for us the circumstances

01:22:21.749 --> 01:22:25.199
under which you found
the body of the deceased?

01:22:26.049 --> 01:22:29.249
We were with a cargo
of coal to be delivered

01:22:29.349 --> 01:22:31.249
and I saw a body floating by

01:22:31.349 --> 01:22:33.799
and I fished it out, with Joe

01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:37.049
- Joe?
- My mate

01:22:38.899 --> 01:22:40.349
I see

01:22:40.849 --> 01:22:42.849
Was Ms. Dimly dead when you...

01:22:44.499 --> 01:22:48.549
- fished her out of the water?
- Yes, she was dead already

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:51.599
Thank you

01:22:52.899 --> 01:22:54.549
No further questions

01:22:55.099 --> 01:22:58.349
We have no further questions

01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:01.299
Thank you, you may step down

01:23:51.899 --> 01:23:54.349
So? You think he's guilty?

01:23:55.849 --> 01:23:59.049
- The murder is not proved yet
- What do you mean?

01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:01.349
They didn't prove that it was

01:24:01.384 --> 01:24:02.749
They know that

01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:05.149
Woman don't get
undressed for nothing

01:24:05.184 --> 01:24:08.249
- She had sex
- You'll see

01:24:11.049 --> 01:24:12.449
They'll hang him

01:24:13.099 --> 01:24:14.399
Poor beggar

01:24:15.249 --> 01:24:18.749
According to the examination
of the deceased's shoes

01:24:19.249 --> 01:24:22.749
It was found that they matched
exactly those of the accused

01:24:22.899 --> 01:24:26.364
Also the fibers found
under her finger nails

01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:28.849
exactly matched the material
of the accused's shirt

01:24:29.549 --> 01:24:31.799
There could be no mistakes

01:24:32.549 --> 01:24:36.299
The chances that they could belong
to anyone else are practically nill

01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:40.099
With the evidence of sexual
activities and the main of reason

01:24:40.949 --> 01:24:45.999
in my opinion there is
overwhelming evidence

01:24:46.024 --> 01:24:48.789
that the deceased had intimate
contact with the accused

01:24:48.899 --> 01:24:51.299
- very shortly before her death
- Objection

01:24:51.449 --> 01:24:53.649
These facts do not have
any relevance for the jury

01:24:53.749 --> 01:24:54.999
Overruled

01:25:35.299 --> 01:25:37.549
I wasn't with
her then. I swear

01:25:37.584 --> 01:25:39.799
I never went near the river

01:25:40.049 --> 01:25:41.799
Silence! Silence!
Keep order.

01:25:42.949 --> 01:25:45.749
Just answer the
question, Mr. Gordon.

01:25:46.299 --> 01:25:47.949
What was the question, sir?

01:25:50.999 --> 01:25:53.499
What did you do after removing
the deceased's clothes?

01:25:54.299 --> 01:25:55.899
I never took her clothes off

01:25:55.999 --> 01:25:58.249
We just went for
a walk together

01:25:58.399 --> 01:26:01.599
- You was with her
- No, not then

01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:02.949
I see

01:26:04.249 --> 01:26:06.699
Were you aware that the
deceased was pregnant?

01:26:07.622 --> 01:26:08.622
No

01:26:10.449 --> 01:26:12.299
No, it wasn't me. No

01:26:12.749 --> 01:26:15.499
I didn't. I didn't

01:26:15.799 --> 01:26:18.249
- You new she was pregnant?
- No

01:26:18.849 --> 01:26:22.599
You planed to get rid of her before
your wife discover your dark secret

01:26:22.673 --> 01:26:23.673
No

01:26:24.399 --> 01:26:27.649
- She invited you to
her house as a tradesman

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:31.149
She trusted you
as a tradesman

01:26:31.799 --> 01:26:35.849
You abused that position of
trust, you preyed on her loneliness

01:26:59.999 --> 01:27:03.199
<i>I alone was with Catherine
Dimly at the time she died</i>

01:27:03.499 --> 01:27:05.549
<i>The drowning was accidental</i>

01:27:05.949 --> 01:27:07.599
<i>There was no murder</i>

01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:11.349
<i>I cannot identify myself without
the risk of finding myself</i>

01:27:11.423 --> 01:27:14.773
<i>in the same shoes
as Mr. Gordon.</i>

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:17.446
<i>I made a mistake of not
reporting the accident at the time</i>

01:27:17.049 --> 01:27:19.299
<i>and I have that
on my conscience</i>

01:27:19.799 --> 01:27:22.049
<i>If you condemn Mr. Gordon,</i>

01:27:22.449 --> 01:27:24.849
<i>you'll be condemning
an innocent man</i>

01:28:40.499 --> 01:28:43.449
Ladies and gentlemen,
who speaks for you?

01:28:44.049 --> 01:28:46.149
Have you reached a verdict?

01:28:46.749 --> 01:28:47.499
Yes

01:28:47.849 --> 01:28:49.449
What is your verdict?

01:28:49.549 --> 01:28:52.049
We find the accused
guilty as charged

01:28:52.199 --> 01:28:55.099
Is your verdict
unanimous or by majority?

01:28:55.499 --> 01:28:56.599
Unanimous

01:29:00.199 --> 01:29:02.699
Would the accused please stand

01:29:09.249 --> 01:29:12.899
Mr. Gordon, do you have anything to
say before the sentence is passed?

01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:16.364
I swear to god I'm innocent

01:29:18.399 --> 01:29:20.349
- You thought about the child?
- Silence!

01:29:20.449 --> 01:29:22.199
Now clear the court

01:29:24.449 --> 01:29:27.099
Mr. Daniel Gordon, you
have been found guilty

01:29:27.134 --> 01:29:29.499
Of the murder of
Ms. Catherine Dimly.

01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:32.499
After taking in considerations

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:34.799
all the circumstances
of this case

01:29:34.999 --> 01:29:38.399
I have no choice but to impose

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.599
the maximum penalty

01:29:43.249 --> 01:29:48.199
I therefore sentence you to be hang
by the neck until you are dead

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:50.899
May God have
merci on your soul

01:29:51.399 --> 01:29:53.049
Take the prisoner out

01:30:02.199 --> 01:30:04.149
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury

01:30:04.349 --> 01:30:07.599
thank you for your civic duty

01:30:08.399 --> 01:30:10.049
All rise!
