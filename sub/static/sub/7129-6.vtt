00:11.000 --> 00:12.792
I didn't know
you'd invited her.

00:12.792 --> 00:15.125
I brought her for you.
Ohh.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.875
And I didn't
get you anything.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.834
It just seemed like
you guys were really
hitting it off,

00:18.834 --> 00:21.125
so I thought I'd
give you some space--

00:21.125 --> 00:23.333
you know, away from--
ehhhh!

00:23.333 --> 00:24.834
Why am I even
worrying about this?

00:24.834 --> 00:26.625
I completely trust him.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.834
The question is,
do you trust her?

00:28.834 --> 00:33.041
You are a brilliant,
brilliant writer.

00:33.041 --> 00:36.125
I can't believe
I get to work with you.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.917

Oh, yeah, fuck me!

Who?

01:59.417 --> 02:01.875
Nah, she's just
hating me.

02:01.875 --> 02:02.959
You're getting,
like, the overflow.

02:02.959 --> 02:04.834
You think?
Yeah.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.750
I'm really the star
of her hate.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.250
You're, at best,
co-hated.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.333
[Sighs]

02:13.125 --> 02:15.583

with your mind?

02:15.583 --> 02:17.083
Mm-hmm.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.625
For some reason,
it's not working.

02:19.625 --> 02:22.500
Oh, God. Now she's got
what's-her-name from
the network hating me.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.834
Who? Oh, her.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.125
Are they still staring?

02:27.125 --> 02:28.875
Don't! Don't look.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.125
You're
a fucking lunatic.

02:30.125 --> 02:31.917
How many diet pills
did you take today?

02:31.917 --> 02:34.208
I don't take
diet pills.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.250
Okay.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.750
Last night, I--

02:42.208 --> 02:43.917
Last night, I saw Sean

02:43.917 --> 02:46.458
wanking to
a porn video of her.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.458
Oh, Jesus.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.458
Is that thing
still online?

02:50.458 --> 02:51.792
You know about it?

02:51.792 --> 02:53.083
Are you kidding?

02:53.083 --> 02:55.041
Merc used to
make us watch it.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.583
It helped him.
Eww.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.000
So, what did he say
when you caught him?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.583
He didn't see me.

03:01.583 --> 03:04.041
Oh, God.
I remember that video.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.458
She has the most
amazing abs.

03:05.458 --> 03:08.125
Hey.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.166
I don't know
how she does it.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.834
I do, like,
a bajillion crunches a day,

03:12.834 --> 03:15.208
and I still look
like a "before" picture.

03:15.208 --> 03:17.041
You really can't
not talk about you,
can you?

03:17.041 --> 03:19.166
I know.
That's the problem.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.375
Hello. I hear
you two stoners

03:21.375 --> 03:23.291
made quite a night
of it last night.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.917
Um...for the record,

03:25.917 --> 03:28.250
that is not something
I make a habit of.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.750
Heh. You had pre-rolled
joints in your bag.

03:31.750 --> 03:35.125
Yeah, well, I also have
tampons in my bag.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.291
But I only use them
once a month.

03:37.291 --> 03:38.583
What?

03:38.583 --> 03:40.291
He likes to pretend
that doesn't happen.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.417
That's not true.

03:41.417 --> 03:42.875
Menstrual flow.
Ahh!

03:42.875 --> 03:45.291
[Laughs]
Wait, wait, wait.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.458
You guys have
a hiatus day
tomorrow, right?

03:47.458 --> 03:48.834
Thank God!

03:48.834 --> 03:49.959
Free for lunch?

03:49.959 --> 03:51.375
Oh, that'd be fun.

03:51.375 --> 03:52.792
Not with me. With Merc.

03:52.792 --> 03:53.959
That would be
less fun.

03:53.959 --> 03:56.667
Oh, come on.
You'll schmooze,

03:56.667 --> 03:59.041
you'll talk
about the show,

03:59.041 --> 04:01.500
you'll tell him
how great it's going.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.959
Is there a problem?

04:02.959 --> 04:07.041
Hmm, not a problem
per se.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.834
The way you say
"per se", it's like...

04:08.834 --> 04:10.750
"It's not a tumor per se."

04:10.750 --> 04:12.542
There's a chance

04:12.542 --> 04:15.375
Merc may have cooled
on the show
a little bit.

04:15.375 --> 04:18.291
What? Five days ago,
he was over the moon.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.959
That was five days ago.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.291
We're shooting
a lot of pilots now.

04:23.291 --> 04:25.125
Bright,
shiny new things.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.750
I just think
if you have lunch,

04:26.750 --> 04:28.291
it'll give him
a chance to remember

04:28.291 --> 04:30.250
how crazy he is
about the two of you.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.500
Seriously?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.750
Merc's just
one of those guys.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.583
Sometimes he needs
to be reminded

04:35.583 --> 04:37.375
of the people
he loves.

04:38.417 --> 04:39.625
Back on you?

04:39.625 --> 04:40.917
Oh, so what?

04:53.333 --> 04:54.542
Hi.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.125
Hey, what are you
doing here?

04:56.125 --> 04:57.458
How'd you get past
the guard at the gate?

04:57.458 --> 04:58.875
I waved.

04:58.875 --> 04:59.959
Of course you did.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.125
Is Beverly home?

05:01.125 --> 05:02.750
Why?
I need to talk to her.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.500
I couldn't sleep
last night.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.041
I feel like,
for some reason,
she hates me.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.959
[Laughs] She--

05:08.959 --> 05:10.375
She doesn't hate you.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.375
Honey, don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

05:12.375 --> 05:15.333
Look, um, she doesn't
hate you...per se.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.834
She's just
a little jealous.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.583
Jealous of what?

05:19.583 --> 05:22.625
She has these, um,
ridiculous concerns

05:22.625 --> 05:26.125
that there might be
a certain...

05:26.125 --> 05:28.917
attraction between us.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.208
Why?
I don't know.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.542
She sees us
together on set.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.667
Doing what?
Nothing. That's
what I told her.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.375
That's crazy.
I'll talk to her.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.125
Also, I may not have
helped the situation

05:38.125 --> 05:40.333
by telling her
about our little...

05:40.333 --> 05:42.792
uh, moment
the other night.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.500
Are you being funny?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.166
I can't tell when
you're being funny.
What moment?

05:46.166 --> 05:49.000
At the charity thing,
when you...

05:49.000 --> 05:50.959
asked me
to drive you home.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.417
That wasn't a moment.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.125
It was a bit of
a moment.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.125
No, not a moment.
Hmm...

05:56.125 --> 05:57.500
I asked you
to drive me home

05:57.500 --> 05:58.792
because I had
too much to drink.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.709
Okay.

06:00.709 --> 06:02.875
Hey, smuggy.
I wasn't asking you

06:02.875 --> 06:05.208
to "drive me home"
drive me home.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.333
I have a boyfriend.
We live together.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.166
You do?
Uh, yeah.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.333
And even if I was looking
for something else,

06:11.333 --> 06:13.125
it wouldn't be with
my executive producer.

06:13.125 --> 06:14.375
You don't shit
where you eat.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.041
What about toilets
in restaurants?

06:17.041 --> 06:19.458
Wow, you really
can't tell when
I'm being funny.

06:19.458 --> 06:22.375
No.
Wait! This is
a bad, bad idea.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.375
First of all, you'd be
waking her up,

06:23.375 --> 06:25.291
and then she'll
definitely hate you.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.375
A better plan might be--
we let this go.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.750
No, you've got to
talk about stuff.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.542
You see? Here we have

06:31.542 --> 06:33.709
a significant
cultural divide.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.834
Our people don't believe
in talking about stuff.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.083
We prefer
suppressing the stuff
and letting it fester.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.417
It's kind of our thing.

06:40.417 --> 06:42.542
Listen, I know my wife.

06:42.542 --> 06:44.750
However well you imagine
this conversation will go,

06:44.750 --> 06:46.750
it will only
make things worse.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.542
Listen, we've got
one more day of shooting.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.208
Let's just get on with it,
and everyone can calm down.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.709
I don't want
to lose my job.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.750
You won't lose your job.
I'll see to that.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.166
I promise.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.417
Okay.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.041
Thank you.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.250
And that was also
not a--

07:17.250 --> 07:19.083
Not a moment.
Not a moment.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.458
Yeah. Okay.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.083
What are you doing?

07:28.083 --> 07:30.250

07:30.250 --> 07:32.000

No.

No!

07:33.083 --> 07:34.667

You stay.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.500
You're obviously
flourishing here.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.667
Is this because
I went surfing today?

07:38.667 --> 07:41.250
Okay, obviously it's not
because I went surfing.

hasn't exactly been
your favorite--

07:46.458 --> 07:49.583

It's one more day
of shooting,
a week in post.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.083
Move.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.500
Front door ajar.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.959
One week. Then the work
will be done,

08:02.959 --> 08:04.875
and we can both
leave together, with
our heads held high.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.625
Heads held high?

08:06.625 --> 08:08.625
Have you not seen
our heads?

08:08.625 --> 08:11.083
It's all we can do
to not kick them
when we walk.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.625
All right, look, we've
made some compromises--

08:12.625 --> 08:15.291
This isn't about
the fucking show.

08:15.291 --> 08:16.959
Front door ajar.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.000
Then what is it about?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.333
Front door ajar...

08:19.333 --> 08:22.834
Does this bitch
ever shut up?!

08:22.834 --> 08:24.208
You know what
this is about.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.875
What?

08:25.875 --> 08:29.375
Morning? Oh, my God!
Look, I'm telling you,

08:29.375 --> 08:31.583
I have no interest
in her at all.

08:31.583 --> 08:34.542
I saw you wanking to her
the other night.

08:35.834 --> 08:38.458
What? I--No, I--
How did--

08:38.458 --> 08:42.125
How did? Who did?
I--I--

08:42.125 --> 08:43.166
Front door ajar...

08:43.166 --> 08:44.667
All right!

08:44.667 --> 08:47.000
There may have been
a little wanking!

08:47.000 --> 08:48.875
But there is
nothing between us.

08:48.875 --> 08:51.083
I just saw you with her.
What?!

08:51.083 --> 08:52.750
I saw you with her
just now!

08:52.750 --> 08:55.208
I saw you hugging her
in front of our house!

08:55.208 --> 08:57.083
She wasn't here! She--

08:57.083 --> 09:00.000
There was--She wanted--

09:00.000 --> 09:01.959
Ernesto!

09:01.959 --> 09:04.250
Ernesto!
What?

09:04.250 --> 09:06.083
Please turn that off!

09:06.083 --> 09:07.542
[Turns off]

09:07.542 --> 09:09.166
I'm sorry.
Did you want me?

09:09.166 --> 09:11.000
I want you to turn off
the leaf-blower.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.166
I did.
Yeah.

09:12.166 --> 09:15.041
Now. But before--

09:15.041 --> 09:16.375
Hey, Bev!

09:16.375 --> 09:18.041
No! Bev! Wait!

09:19.250 --> 09:20.750
Bev, stop!

09:20.750 --> 09:22.834
You're on the wrong side!

09:22.834 --> 09:25.250
No, Sean--
you're on the wrong side!

09:25.250 --> 09:27.333

10:31.291 --> 10:33.583
What--What are you
doing here?

10:33.583 --> 10:37.000
Uh, it was my car
that got in your way.
What?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.625
I was coming
to pick up Sean
to go dirt biking.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.750
Ohh, Jesus.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.792
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

10:44.792 --> 10:47.125
Am I--
I don't think so.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.792
Anything feel broken?

10:48.792 --> 10:50.333
Hmm, no.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.959
Why don't you try
getting out of the car?

10:55.792 --> 10:57.667
Easy, now. Easy, now.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.125
How does that feel?

11:01.125 --> 11:03.792
Uh...all right,
I think.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.125
You sure? Your neck?

11:06.125 --> 11:07.792
Your back?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.375
Feel your hands?

11:09.375 --> 11:11.333
Uh, yeah,
I think I'm okay.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.834
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

11:13.834 --> 11:14.792
Okay, good.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.750
Then who the fuck
drives like that?!

11:18.750 --> 11:20.208
You weren't even
a little over the line.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.709
You were right there,

11:21.709 --> 11:23.542
all the way over
on my side--

11:23.542 --> 11:26.709
your whole fucking car
full of stupid!

11:26.709 --> 11:29.834
I must've confused
my...countries.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.083
Seriously?

11:31.083 --> 11:33.667
Sean does most of
the driving.
Oh, really?

11:33.667 --> 11:36.583
Is that how you keep
your death count so low?

11:36.583 --> 11:38.333
I'm sorry!

11:38.333 --> 11:40.208
[Cell phone rings]

11:40.208 --> 11:41.500
[Matt sighs]

11:41.500 --> 11:44.250
It's Sean.
So?

11:44.250 --> 11:46.333
I'm not speaking to him.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.041
Maybe really
teach him a lesson--
take him for a drive.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.125
Christ.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.375
Sorry.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.875
[Cell phone rings]

11:53.875 --> 11:55.208
Sean.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.417
Don't.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.750
[Beep]

11:57.750 --> 11:58.750
Hello?

11:58.750 --> 12:00.542
Matt, it's Sean.
Hey.

12:00.542 --> 12:03.917
I'm sorry.
I know you're probably
already on your way here,

12:03.917 --> 12:05.417
but I have to cancel.

12:05.417 --> 12:06.834
Oh, yeah?
What's happening?

12:06.834 --> 12:08.417
Uh, Bev and I had
a bit of a fight.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.667
You're kidding.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.041
She's usually so fun
and easygoing.

12:12.041 --> 12:14.125
No, this is bad.
This is really bad.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.667
She packed a bag
and took off.
Shit.

12:16.667 --> 12:17.875
And you don't know
where she is?

12:17.875 --> 12:19.875
On her way back
to London, I think.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.291
She's not answering
her phone.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.542
All right. Uh...

12:23.542 --> 12:25.125
let me know
what happens,

12:25.125 --> 12:27.250
and we'll talk later.
Okay.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.542
Thank you.

12:28.542 --> 12:29.667
MAN ON SPEAKER:
And, just up ahead,

12:29.667 --> 12:32.250
we have the home of
Bridget Jones herself--

12:32.250 --> 12:33.667
Miss RenÃ©e Zellweger.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.500
Whoa-oh-oh! You guys
are in luck today.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.417
Take a look on your left.
It's TV's Joey--

12:38.417 --> 12:40.250
Matt LeBlanc! Ha ha!

12:40.250 --> 12:41.792
Hey, Matt! Matt!

12:41.792 --> 12:43.208
How you doin'?

12:43.208 --> 12:44.917
How you doin'?

12:44.917 --> 12:46.125
[Chattering]

12:46.125 --> 12:48.250
Ha ha. Not so good.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.625
Ouch. Loving
the gray hair.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.583
Very distinguished.
Thanks.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.250
So, when's that Friends
reunion gonna happen?

12:55.250 --> 12:56.834
Not today.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.583
How about you?
You ever gonna work again?

12:59.583 --> 13:02.166
Soon.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.250
Is your friend anybody?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.500
No.
No.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.750
All right.
We gotta get going.

13:06.750 --> 13:07.834
See you, Matt.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.917
Matt LeBlanc, everybody.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.125
Bye!
Bye-bye, now!

13:13.458 --> 13:15.250
That was unpleasant.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.458
Yeah. I gotta
get out of here.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.542
Don't we have to
call the police or--

13:17.542 --> 13:19.250
No, no, I'll call
my assistant.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.417
She'll take care
of everyth--

13:20.417 --> 13:22.333
Jesus.
What.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.917
You're bleeding.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.333
Oh.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.375
Hi, Bev. It's me again.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.709
Um, I don't know
where you are.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.750
Maybe you're on a plane
already. I don't know.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.959
I'm about to have that
bloody lunch with Merc

13:35.959 --> 13:37.667
to try and save
our stupid show.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.792
Although, right now
I have no idea why.

13:39.792 --> 13:42.250
But please, please--
when you get this,

13:42.250 --> 13:43.792
please call me.

13:43.792 --> 13:46.417
There is nothing
between me and Morning.

13:46.417 --> 13:49.458
Except, of course,
for the wanking.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.333
I'm not very proud of that.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.375
But other than some
garden-variety masturbation,
there's no--

13:54.375 --> 13:56.875
What? What?
You don't do that here?

14:09.875 --> 14:11.834
Ow! That hurts!

14:11.834 --> 14:13.500
Oh, it's just
a little scrape.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.834
Don't be
such a baby.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.834
I'm not a baby.
I just had a car crash.

14:16.834 --> 14:19.000
No, you caused
a car crash.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.667
Not even bleeding
anymore.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.000
There, done.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.333
Thank you.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.166
You want a drink?
It's not even noon.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.792
You just had a car crash.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.417
Whiskey, please--
straight.

14:30.417 --> 14:32.041
There you go.

14:38.417 --> 14:42.083
You have a lovely home.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.208
Thanks.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.875
[Laughs]

14:45.875 --> 14:48.083
You have taste.

14:48.083 --> 14:51.125
Don't sound so shocked.
Well...

14:51.125 --> 14:53.917
Sean said something about
you going back to London?

14:53.917 --> 14:55.709
Right. That's where
I was heading

14:55.709 --> 14:58.500
when you came at me with
your proper driving skills.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.709
That kind of sucks.
We're not even
done shooting,

15:00.709 --> 15:02.208
and you're just
taking off?

15:02.208 --> 15:04.500
I'm sorry. I realize it's
not very professional.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.875
But, really, the show
can't get any worse
without me.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.792
What are you
talking about?
The show's good.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.750
Uh, no.
What?

15:10.750 --> 15:13.000
It's not good.
It's good.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.375
And yet...

15:14.375 --> 15:16.000
it's not.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Heh. Shut up.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.458
All right.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.792
What's not good about it?

15:26.792 --> 15:28.959
It's not funny enough.
It's not smart enough.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.458
There's nothing
unique or special.

15:30.458 --> 15:33.542
It's just profoundly
mediocre.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.625
You're talking
about our show?

15:36.625 --> 15:38.250
I know, it's shocking

15:38.250 --> 15:40.792
something called
Pucks!
isn't good.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.542
Yeah, well,
that's your opinion.

15:45.542 --> 15:46.875
Not just mine.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.083
Sean's having lunch
with Merc right now

15:49.083 --> 15:50.458
to try and salvage it,

15:50.458 --> 15:52.166
which I doubt very much
he'll be able to do.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.875
Are you serious?

15:53.875 --> 15:56.458
God! It's--
It's really not good?

15:56.458 --> 15:59.834
It's really not.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.083
I thought I was clear.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.041
How did this happen, huh?

16:04.041 --> 16:06.125
When you did it over there,
it was great.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.792
What--

16:07.792 --> 16:09.125
You're actually
asking me that?

16:09.125 --> 16:11.083
You might want to call
a cleaning company,

16:11.083 --> 16:12.834
because there could be
a lot of bits about

16:12.834 --> 16:15.667
when my head explodes!

16:15.667 --> 16:18.500
Why?
Why? Why?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.000
The show we did
over there

16:20.000 --> 16:22.709
was about a witty,
urbane headmaster,

16:22.709 --> 16:24.959
hopelessly in love
with a middle-aged
lesbian.

16:24.959 --> 16:28.250
This show
is pretty much Joey
as a hockey coach

16:28.250 --> 16:29.959
exchanging banter
with a little hottie

16:29.959 --> 16:32.583
we all know
he'll eventually
get into the sack.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.458
Not precisely...

16:35.458 --> 16:37.500
the same show.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.709
Yeah? Well, you know...

16:39.709 --> 16:41.875
if you didn't
like it that way,
you shouldn't have done it.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.125
Again...
[Imitates explosion]

16:44.125 --> 16:45.125
What?!

16:45.125 --> 16:46.542
Shouldn't
have done it?

16:46.542 --> 16:48.125
As if we ever
had a choice!

16:48.125 --> 16:50.750
God, you are
an unstoppable force.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.208
This is the show
you wanted.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.750
You made him
a hockey coach.

16:53.750 --> 16:54.875
You made her
straight.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.834
Every shitty change
we've had to make

16:57.834 --> 16:59.291
is because of you.

16:59.291 --> 17:02.333
Oh, yes, my friend.

17:02.333 --> 17:05.625
You caused
this car wreck.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.333
Me again.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.917
I don't know why.

17:15.917 --> 17:19.083
Unless you're waiting for
a certain number of calls.

17:19.083 --> 17:22.417
"Right. 31. I think
I'll pick up now."

17:22.417 --> 17:25.291
All right, he's here.

17:25.291 --> 17:28.000
I swear to God--
he's hugging a waiter now.

17:30.542 --> 17:31.875
Here he comes.
I've got to go.

17:33.542 --> 17:35.208
[British accent]
Please, sir,
I want some more.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.333
Ohh, a little  Oliver.
Ha ha!

17:37.333 --> 17:38.625
Wouldn't be lunch
without it.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.750
Where's milady?

17:40.750 --> 17:44.125
Uh, milady has been
throwing up all morning.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.041
Stomach flu.
Eesh!

17:46.041 --> 17:48.041
She wanted
to come, but...

17:48.041 --> 17:50.834
So, talk to me.
How's it going?

17:50.834 --> 17:53.333
Well, uh, the show's
going very well.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.041
Bev and I can't wait
for you to see it.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.375
I don't want
to oversell it,

17:56.375 --> 17:57.625
but I think you'll be
rather pleased.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.208
That's great.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.000
The stuff between
Matt and the boys

18:03.000 --> 18:04.917
is extraordinary.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.083
I have to say--
you were so right

18:07.083 --> 18:10.291
to champion the idea of
him being a hockey coach.

18:10.291 --> 18:11.917
Really? That's working?

18:11.917 --> 18:13.583
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

18:13.583 --> 18:16.750
Um, Matt's found a lot
of physical humor.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.875
He really is genius.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.917
Well, I don't have
to tell you that.

18:22.917 --> 18:24.417
It was your idea
to cast him.

18:24.417 --> 18:27.583
Can you see him
playing a con man?

18:27.583 --> 18:30.208
What?
A con man.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.917
In, like, a one-hour
kind of a--

18:31.917 --> 18:34.375
well, a light
comedy-drama?

18:34.375 --> 18:36.583
Uh--
He'd be good, right?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.125
As good as Stamos?

18:38.125 --> 18:39.583
John Stamos from  ER?

18:39.583 --> 18:41.083
He's better
than Stamos, right?

18:41.083 --> 18:42.709
Well, I suppose
he would--

18:42.709 --> 18:44.959
He's very good
in our show.
May I ask--

18:44.959 --> 18:46.458
Hang on a second.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.250
Come here,
you talented fuck!

18:48.250 --> 18:50.709
Hey, man,
how you doing?

18:50.709 --> 18:52.458
You get that pilot?
Yeah, I got it.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.625
You did?
What'd I tell you?

19:02.166 --> 19:04.542
I really needed
this one to work.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.875
I know.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.208
Is it too late
to fix it?

19:09.208 --> 19:10.709
We could go back to
the original script.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.667
Yeah?
And recast.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.458
You're mean.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.959
I am mean.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.458
What do I do now?

19:25.291 --> 19:27.250
You'll find
something else.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.125
They sent me this script
about a con man.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.291
It's a total
piece of crap.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.709
It's, like, why would I
want to do that...

19:39.709 --> 19:42.333
when we're doing our own
piece of crap already?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.291
[Laughs]
Yeah.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.166
You laugh.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.917
At least you get to
go home after this.

19:47.917 --> 19:49.166
I don't have
any other countries.

19:50.542 --> 19:51.750
Right.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.792
The question is...

19:53.792 --> 19:55.458
what am I
going back to?

19:55.458 --> 19:58.166
And will I be married
when I'm there?

19:58.166 --> 20:00.083
What are you
talking about?

20:00.083 --> 20:02.834
I know about Sean
and Morning.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.834
Sean's not doing--

20:04.834 --> 20:07.458
Don't even bother.
I know you're on his side.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.458
I can't believe
anything you say.

20:11.583 --> 20:13.208
All righty.

20:15.375 --> 20:17.041
You know, of all
the horrible things
I imagined

20:17.041 --> 20:19.875
about doing
a TV show here...

20:19.875 --> 20:21.917
I never saw
this one coming.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.709
Yeah. It's a fun town.

20:23.709 --> 20:26.041
And you just know
I'm gonna come off
as the villain.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.625
You? Why?

20:28.625 --> 20:30.083
I don't know. Somehow.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.166
Because it's Sean,
and he's wonderful

20:32.166 --> 20:34.500
and charming,
and everyone loves him.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.375
So, I always come off
like the bitch.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.709
Maybe you are
a bitch.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.083
[Chuckles]

20:44.083 --> 20:46.250
I'd like to think
I just have integrity.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.542
Yeah. That's why
people always say,

20:48.542 --> 20:51.375
"She's such a fuckin'
woman with integrity."

20:51.375 --> 20:52.709
[Laughs]

20:55.250 --> 20:57.750
Do people really
call me a bitch?

20:59.709 --> 21:01.250
Nah.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.792
Probably just me.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.417
Fuckin' feta cheese.

21:11.417 --> 21:13.250
Suddenly
it's everywhere,
you know what I mean?

21:13.250 --> 21:15.250
Enough with the feta.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.583
Yes, I suppose it is
one of your more...

21:17.583 --> 21:20.250
ubiquitous cheeses.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.583
Hmm.
What?

21:21.583 --> 21:24.291
My wife just
walked in.

21:24.291 --> 21:26.166
Oh. Do you want
to go over?

21:26.166 --> 21:28.375
Nah, I saw her
this morning.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.291
You don't want to
at least say hello?
Nah.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.458
If I don't talk
too loud,

21:31.458 --> 21:32.709
she'll never know
I'm here.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.291
That's one of
the perks.

21:34.291 --> 21:35.542
Ah.

21:35.542 --> 21:37.291
Hey, speaking
of wives--

21:37.291 --> 21:40.250
does, uh--
does yours know

21:40.250 --> 21:43.417
about the thing
with you and
Morning Randolph?

21:43.417 --> 21:44.667
What?

21:44.667 --> 21:47.417
[Laughs] The thing
with you and Morning.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.542
Me and--No.
With--With--

21:50.542 --> 21:51.875
Where--
Where'd you hear that?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.500
Where--Where--Where--
[Laughs]

21:53.500 --> 21:55.750
[Whistles] A little
birdie told me.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.417
Who are the Lincolns?

21:59.417 --> 22:02.417
Put down the fucking
BlackBerry.

22:02.417 --> 22:03.917
It's down.
Who are the Lincolns?

22:03.917 --> 22:06.583
Sean and Beverly.
The English couple.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.291
And I'm having lunch
with them why?

22:08.291 --> 22:09.792
You like them.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.875
I like their accents.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.583
It'll be nice.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.000
They're interesting.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.583
[Scoffs]
Tell me one thing

22:16.583 --> 22:18.041
that's interesting
about them,

22:18.041 --> 22:19.333
and I'll have lunch
with them.

22:19.333 --> 22:22.166
He may be screwing
Morning Randolph.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.500
Oh.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.083
Maybe we'll go
to Vincenti.

22:25.083 --> 22:27.166
Ooh, slow down.
I'm close.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.667
I assure you,
there is nothing--

22:30.667 --> 22:33.041
nothing going on
between me and Morning.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.667
Hey, I wouldn't
blame you if there was.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.291
I've been to that rodeo.

22:37.291 --> 22:39.375
Let me tell you,
that bronco can buck.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.000
What, you and Morning?
Oh, yeah.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.834
Years ago. She still
had her real tits.

22:42.834 --> 22:44.125
Man, do I remember it.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.333
Heh. You've seen
her video, right?

22:46.333 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, I--

22:48.000 --> 22:49.542
Yeah, I believe I have.

22:49.542 --> 22:52.458
Well, in person--
oh, my God.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.834
[Laughs]
She does stuff--

22:54.834 --> 22:57.667
My dick was sending me
thank-you notes.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.834
"Me and the balls
just want to say
muchas gracias."

23:00.834 --> 23:02.542
So, they're Spanish.

23:02.542 --> 23:04.208
But can I give you
a little advice?

23:04.208 --> 23:06.208
I can't tell you
how to write.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.250
I couldn't even
tell you what makes
a TV show work.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.291
Good to know.
But I can tell you this.

23:10.291 --> 23:12.458
This thing with Morning--
don't do it.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.000
Oh, I have no intention
of doing it.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.417
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen to me.
It's not worth it.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.291
What you have with--

23:17.291 --> 23:19.000
Beverly.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.750
[Laughs] I know.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.208
What you have
with Beverly

23:23.208 --> 23:25.417
is so precious
and so rare.

23:25.417 --> 23:26.750
It's like
what I have

23:26.750 --> 23:28.458
with that amazing
woman over there.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.333
It'd be so easy
to cheat on her.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.667
Well...obviously.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.583
Right.
[Laughs]

23:34.583 --> 23:36.917
But I would
never do it.
Okay.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.291
You and me.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.208
We're the last
of the good guys.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.083
We gotta
stay strong.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.750
We owe it
to ourselves,

23:44.750 --> 23:49.083
and we owe it to
those remarkable,
beautiful women.

23:49.083 --> 23:52.041
But you don't want to
go over and say hello?

23:52.041 --> 23:53.417
Ah, I'll see her
at home.

23:59.375 --> 24:02.166
Have you ever
been cheated on?

24:02.166 --> 24:05.750
Hmmmmm...

24:05.750 --> 24:06.917
no.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.709
Well, that seems
massively unfair.

24:08.709 --> 24:12.250
Well, I'm usually the one
doin' the doin'.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.417
Is it
the gigantic dick?

24:14.417 --> 24:16.458
Does it demand
more than one woman?

24:16.458 --> 24:20.125
I assume you don't
want to make it cross.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.083
Our marriage
counselor said

24:22.083 --> 24:24.375
I have a need to
sabotage my happiness.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.458
But I like your
dick thing better.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.083
I think you just like
your dick thing.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.667
I still can't believe
you took it out

24:31.667 --> 24:34.083
and showed it
to my husband.
Who does that?

24:34.083 --> 24:36.458
I want to say...
not guys with little dicks?

24:36.458 --> 24:38.250
[Chuckles]

24:38.250 --> 24:40.667
Well, he was
traumatized.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.458
He had nightmares
about...

24:42.458 --> 24:45.792
enormous dachshunds
and rogue bananas.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.250
[Laughs]

24:47.250 --> 24:48.959
Served him right,
the bastard.

24:48.959 --> 24:50.792
How could he
do this to me?

24:50.792 --> 24:52.750
I know. Men.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.333
No, I'm actually
asking you.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.125
How could he do it?
I don't understand.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.959
You might now.
You're the expert.

24:59.959 --> 25:01.083
Did you love your wife?

25:05.959 --> 25:07.834
Yeah.

25:07.834 --> 25:09.750
I loved her.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.375
So?

25:11.375 --> 25:13.458
How could you just
chuck that away?

25:13.458 --> 25:14.583
What were you
thinking?

25:14.583 --> 25:17.000
Um...I wasn't.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.667
The shrink also said
I have an inability

25:19.667 --> 25:22.750
to appreciate
the consequences
of my actions.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.625
You're just a mess,
aren't you?

25:24.625 --> 25:25.709
Oh, yeah.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.875
Well...

25:29.875 --> 25:32.208
you should be proud.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.458
You taught
my husband well.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.041
How much of this
was your doing?

25:38.041 --> 25:41.333
How much of what
was my doing?

25:41.333 --> 25:43.542
Matt, I'm just
thinking--

25:43.542 --> 25:45.917
the night you went
to that rape thing,

25:45.917 --> 25:47.417
you had
two extra tickets,

25:47.417 --> 25:50.333
but you took Sean
and her, not me.

25:51.542 --> 25:53.667
What were you
up to there?

25:55.208 --> 25:56.709
I don't know.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.208
Ow. I guess
I liked her better.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.166
She didn't kick me.

26:01.166 --> 26:02.458
Bollocks.

26:02.458 --> 26:05.208
What the hell were
you trying to do?

26:05.208 --> 26:07.500
Hey! Okay!

26:10.375 --> 26:12.375
I just wanted him
to have a little fun.

26:12.375 --> 26:15.542
Uhh! That was back
when I didn't think
you were fun.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.542
You bloody prick.
You set them up.

26:18.834 --> 26:20.583
Let go.
Okay.

26:20.583 --> 26:22.417
If you promise
to stop kicking me.

26:22.417 --> 26:23.667
I promise.

26:27.959 --> 26:30.291
You are responsible
for every terrible thing

26:30.291 --> 26:32.125
Stop!
that's happened to me
since I got here.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.041
You destroyed my show,
my marriage!

26:34.041 --> 26:35.458
Okay.
Ow! Ow!

26:35.458 --> 26:37.083
Okay, you want
to let it out?

26:37.083 --> 26:38.250
Fine, let it out.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.542
Yeah, let it out!

26:39.542 --> 26:40.709
Aah! Ow!

26:40.709 --> 26:41.792
Okay, stop
letting it out.

26:41.792 --> 26:44.291
Enough letting it out!

26:44.291 --> 26:46.041
No!

26:46.041 --> 26:48.709
[Panting]

26:51.458 --> 26:52.917
Is that a--

26:52.917 --> 26:55.083
No.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.458
Yes, it is.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.834
I can feel it.

26:57.834 --> 26:59.250
Maybe a semi.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.083
That's just a semi?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.625
I'm horrified
on so many levels.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.208
And...
on the other levels?

27:08.208 --> 27:09.625
You're disgusting.

27:09.625 --> 27:10.750
Sure.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.417
If you want me
to stop...

27:18.834 --> 27:20.792
say stop.

27:26.917 --> 27:28.750
Stop.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.750
[Sighs]

27:44.625 --> 27:47.083
Oh, my God.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.750
That really was
just a semi.
