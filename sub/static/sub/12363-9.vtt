00:03.169 --> 00:04.898
[Walt] Well, it looks pretty big.

00:05.605 --> 00:08.369
Should be able to get enough timber
to do my cabin steps.

00:08.575 --> 00:11.408
[Henry] It is a sign...
that you are a lucky man.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.045
Good timing.
The election is a week away.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.737
One day you're standing tall.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.852
Next day, people
are walkin' all over you.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.680
A lot can change in a week.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.289
Ignore the polls.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.290
I do.

00:29.229 --> 00:31.459
There are some things I can't ignore.

00:31.664 --> 00:34.895
You still haven't told me about
your chat with Detective Fales.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.035
You know the police.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.966
He asked questions and I answered.

00:39.172 --> 00:42.437
In one week you will be re-elected
and life will get back to normal.

00:42.642 --> 00:43.642
We'll see.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.210
That verged on optimism,
almost excitement.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.904
- You want this job.
- Let's just finish this one.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.049
- You want Branch to win?
- No.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.742
- So you want this job.
- Knock it off.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.154
[Chainsaw revving]

00:57.824 --> 00:59.985
You have never said
you want anything.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.490
Just say it.

01:01.694 --> 01:06.154
Come on. Say you want to be Sheriff
and you want to win.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.503
OK.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.508
- I wanna win.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.710
[Branch] No, no, no, no. [laughs]

01:28.922 --> 01:31.823
Don't put words in my mouth.
Walt Longmire's done a fine job.

01:31.958 --> 01:36.657
All I'm sayin' is Absaroka County
deserves more than fine.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.988
We need to look forward,
not backward.

01:39.165 --> 01:42.032
[Electronic beeping]

Return to your vehicle, ma'am!
You know how fast you were going?

02:09.229 --> 02:10.662
80 in a 55.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.958
- 81. Return to your vehicle.
- We need to talk.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.361
- Here?
- Yeah.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.196
Um, I didn't ass-dial you
the other night.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.998
I called you
and pretended I ass-dialed you.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.200
I have ass-dialed you,
but not that time.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.572
That time, I wanted to see you.
And I can't.

02:27.614 --> 02:30.208
My head's not in the right place
for a relationship.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.874
I wanted to call you and tell you
this, but I'm sick of the phone...

02:34.053 --> 02:37.580
...and I'm not gonna text,
so I wanted to say it face to face.

02:37.724 --> 02:41.751
Well... we could've met for coffee
or at the monkey bars.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.588
I didn't want anyone to see us
and start gossiping.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.425
I mean, you know this town,
right, so...

02:46.599 --> 02:48.260
[car horn honks]

02:48.968 --> 02:51.835
Now it just looks like
you're giving me a ticket.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.005
Yeah. Great.

02:53.173 --> 02:57.269
It looks like candidate Connally is
harassing the competition's daughter.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.478
Don't bring politics into this.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.743
We're friends, right? But that's it.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.608
That I can do.
Nothing more. I'm done.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.019
You wanna say something?

03:11.424 --> 03:12.721
Fine.

03:13.826 --> 03:16.294
Cady... we're not done here.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.453
Did you not understand
what I just said?

03:18.698 --> 03:19.960
- Barely.
- OK.

03:22.101 --> 03:24.035
[Engine starts]

03:25.939 --> 03:27.236
I wanna see you again, too.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.237
Not gonna happen.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.142
I think it will.

03:37.483 --> 03:38.609
See you in court.

03:55.868 --> 03:56.994
Do you see anyone?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.660
No!

03:58.871 --> 04:01.135
All right. Let's let it cool down.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.604
Our fire department can handle this.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.811
Volunteer fire department.

04:06.679 --> 04:07.839
Today, we volunteered.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.378
Jeez, relax, Mathias.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.311
He saw the smoke and came runnin'.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.782
Yeah, to a nice photo op.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.544
This is not about the campaign.

04:15.688 --> 04:18.815
That's funny, comin' from
Walt Longmire's campaign chairman.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.855
What the hell happened here?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.058
- I don't know.
- I do.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.696
This house belongs to Dolan Lone Elk.

04:25.898 --> 04:29.766
He's been protesting a fracking
operation just outside the rez.

04:29.969 --> 04:33.769
Now his house blows up from methane
seeping into his water supply.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.237
It's ironic, isn't it?

04:35.408 --> 04:38.639
- What's the name of the company?
- Newett Energy.

04:39.646 --> 04:43.104
Mathias, the link between fracking
and water contamination...

04:43.316 --> 04:45.216
...hasn't totally been proven.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.285
There's some methane
that naturally occurs in sediment.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.183
Not everything's a conspiracy.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.618
Henry, toss me your lighter!

04:52.825 --> 04:55.089
Walt, we just put this fire out.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.437
I rest my case.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.880
These spouts are open.
Water was running.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.517
Which means the gas was leaking.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.515
Someone was definitely home.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.519
All the windows are closed.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.325
This one's locked.

05:31.898 --> 05:35.356
You build up methane pressure in
an enclosed space, you get all this.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.937
Dolan told me the methane levels
made him afraid to take a shower...

05:39.138 --> 05:41.129
...without opening the windows first.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.686
Why didn't Dolan do it this time?

05:54.220 --> 05:55.551
I gotta move him.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.549
You taking the body
to Doc Bloomfield?

06:00.993 --> 06:02.324
Is this suddenly my case?

06:02.428 --> 06:05.625
Ours. My people, your energy company.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.025
Accident or not,
blood is on their hands.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.567
OK, boys, the sooner
we get the autopsy done...

06:10.737 --> 06:13.001
...the faster we find out
what happened.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.643
Ever heard of a burn victim
leakin' blood?

06:22.615 --> 06:24.105
I don't think it's blood.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.614
- What is it?
- Paint.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.119
[Man] What the hell's goin' on here?

06:29.355 --> 06:31.653
- Keep back.
- I have a right to see that body!

06:31.791 --> 06:34.817
- Sir, you can't come in here.
- It's OK. It's his house.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.790
He's Dolan Lone Elk.

06:38.297 --> 06:41.664
If you're Dolan Lone Elk,
then who's this?

06:43.536 --> 06:47.097
Ethan... It's my brother, Ethan.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.442
Take a seat.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.310
Any idea why Ethan was at your home?

06:57.517 --> 06:59.485
He's family.
He doesn't need a reason.

06:59.685 --> 07:00.982
[Vic] And where were you?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.013
I was at a sweat.

07:03.222 --> 07:04.348
[Vic] For what?

07:04.557 --> 07:06.525
For strength. To fight Newett Energy.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.160
Idle No More is planning
a protest here today.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.522
They can't silence us.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.563
Think this explosion
was someone trying to silence you?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.394
Since I started tellin' people
what this company...

07:16.602 --> 07:18.467
...is doing to our land
and our water...

07:18.671 --> 07:20.764
...they've been tryin'
to intimidate me.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.534
My brother's murder will just make
our voices stronger and stronger.

07:24.744 --> 07:29.738
OK, so if it wasn't an accident,
why would someone kill Ethan?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.246
They thought he was me.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.243
I guess all Cheyenne look the same
to everybody at Newett.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.412
Was Ethan part of Idle No More?

07:37.623 --> 07:42.151
No. After he graduated high school,
he left the rez for college.

07:42.361 --> 07:46.320
He moved back and accepted a
management job at Nighthorse casino.

07:46.532 --> 07:50.764
He figured white presidents on green
paper would cure all that ails us.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.564
Maybe he just didn't know
about the methane problem.

07:53.773 --> 07:56.901
Ethan knew.
All Cheyenne knew about it.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.805
We gotta open windows and doors
just to wash our hands!

08:00.012 --> 08:02.776
We have to sleep with windows cracked
and one eye open.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.773
We need to notify Ethan's wife.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.813
Sometimes this news
is better coming from family.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.046
[Dolan] Her name's Lauryn.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.692
She works at the casino, too.
I'd prefer it if you informed her.

08:14.727 --> 08:18.424
If you don't mind, I gotta get back
to my people. I'll see myself out.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.130
Dr. Bloomfield called. He wants you
to come over right away.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.671
Said he needed
to talk to you in person.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.346
Damn it.
I really wanted to meet him.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.883
So, what is
Doc Bloomfield like, anyway?

08:41.087 --> 08:44.955
Ruggedly handsome with a
somewhat irresistible air of mystery.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.819
Hey, Doc. This is Deputy Moretti.

08:48.027 --> 08:51.258
Mother's Japanese.
Father's Scots-Jewish.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.489
Thought I'd be Korean, right?
[Chuckles]

08:53.699 --> 08:55.929
We didn't come here
for your genealogy, Doc.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.966
You said you needed
to talk in person.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.605
The, uh, mayor asked me
to personally oversee the autopsy...

09:02.808 --> 09:04.435
...and inform you of any results.

09:04.644 --> 09:05.906
[Walt] Why?

09:06.112 --> 09:07.909
Apparently, Newett Energy's CEO...

09:08.114 --> 09:10.344
...called the mayor's office
this morning.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.144
Wanted to make sure
no details were overlooked.

09:13.352 --> 09:16.583
Also wanted to make sure
no law enforcement officials...

09:16.789 --> 09:19.451
...jump to any costly conclusions
about liability.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.627
I assume that means me.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.694
Well, you do got a reputation
of bein' a Cheyenne advocate.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.128
You never learned how to properly oil
the haunches of power.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.393
- What did you find?
- So far?

09:30.603 --> 09:32.161
Nothin' but trouble.

09:32.805 --> 09:36.206
First of all, Ethan Lone Elk had been
painted red from head to toe.

09:36.375 --> 09:39.674
Now, the paint fuelled the fire
on his front, as you can see.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.243
But his back was preserved.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.414
Most likely 'cause he was lying down
when the blast occurred.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.949
I took a sample of the paint.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.883
Red. Oil-based.
Here. I cut a swatch from his shirt.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.621
And I hate racial stereotypes
as much as the next guy...

09:54.894 --> 09:57.988
...but looks like
he was one drunk Indian.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.926
I swabbed inside his cheek.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.497
Hardly seems official.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.332
You can't get a tox screen
back in 24 hours, can you?

10:08.541 --> 10:11.339
We don't have the luxury of time,
given all the givens.

10:11.544 --> 10:15.002
So, Deputy Moretti,
please, do me a favor.

10:16.015 --> 10:20.179
I want you to hold this mouthpiece
over Ethan's mouth, just like so.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.279
Grazie.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.048
Walt, I want you to stand there.

10:25.257 --> 10:28.988
On the count of three, press down
on the victim's chest. Ready?

10:29.195 --> 10:31.390
One, two, three.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.288
[Air exhaling]

10:34.467 --> 10:35.934
- [Beeping]
- [Whistles]

10:36.102 --> 10:38.070
He just blew a.34.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.499
That's a hell
of a lot of beer, eh, Walt?

10:40.706 --> 10:44.836
We didn't find any empty beer bottles
or cans, anything, at his house.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.411
So Ethan was drinking.

10:47.546 --> 10:52.176
Doesn't explain why he was painted
red before a house went up in flames.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.118
- Hey, Ruby.
- Where are you goin'?

11:02.528 --> 11:04.257
Uh, to my desk.

11:04.430 --> 11:08.196
- Nope. Walt wants us to go out.
- Why?

11:08.367 --> 11:10.267
Paint shopping. To match this color.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.231
Where's this from?

11:13.472 --> 11:16.464
Off a gentleman from the rez.
Ethan Lone Elk.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.504
I just don't get people sometimes.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.736
They painted his entire body red.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.574
It's horrible. Let's go, hotshot.

11:31.157 --> 11:36.459
[Jacob] Full-time jobs and medical benefits
for 42 Cheyenne, 14 Arapaho...

11:36.662 --> 11:39.130
...six Lakota and three Crow.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.831
Now, remind me.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.096
Uh, how, again, is this casino
a negative influence for the rez?

11:45.337 --> 11:47.305
I'm not here
to debate with you, Jacob.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.440
I need to talk
to one of your employees.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.476
News travels faster than you.
This about the explosion?

11:53.679 --> 11:54.873
No comment.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.537
[Jacob] I didn't tell his wife.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.841
Didn't think it was my place.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.281
That's your job. For now, anyway.

12:01.487 --> 12:05.651
Lauryn Lone Elk,
she's training, third table in.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.454
[Indistinct chatter]

12:14.800 --> 12:18.133
[Lauryn] Face of steel, eyes of steel.
Don't show them a thing.

12:19.805 --> 12:20.805
Lauryn Lone Elk?

12:23.042 --> 12:25.101
I'm Lauryn. How can I help you?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.873
Mrs. Lone Elk, can you take a break?

12:30.149 --> 12:32.811
You have five minutes.
Not a moment more.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.421
I'm very sorry to tell you...

12:38.624 --> 12:42.287
...there was an explosion
on the reservation today.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.127
And your husband, Ethan...
he was killed.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.767

26:50.709 --> 26:54.008
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- What cooperation?

26:54.179 --> 26:55.976
Well, for arresting Mr. Lone Elk here.

26:56.147 --> 26:57.307
I'm releasing him.

26:57.515 --> 27:00.040
I'll take him.
Disruption of business.

27:00.218 --> 27:04.154
Destruction of private property.
Oh, and a politically motivated murder.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.356
You think I killed my brother?

27:06.524 --> 27:09.857
Oh, Dolan, I imagine you probably thought
blowin' up your own house...

27:10.061 --> 27:12.586
...would result in some publicity
for your cause.

27:12.864 --> 27:13.864
It has.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.192
What are you implying?

27:15.400 --> 27:19.461
What I'm saying is, is that Mr.
Lone Elk here has hit the big time.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.195
He's now a domestic terrorist.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.514
[Sizzling]

27:37.222 --> 27:38.450
[Laughs]

27:38.723 --> 27:41.988
Well, in the realm of drunken
mistakes, that was not so bad.

27:42.160 --> 27:46.028
Mm. Maybe that should be
my new campaign slogan.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.293
"Branch Connally: Not so bad."

27:49.501 --> 27:50.501
Good.

27:50.702 --> 27:51.999
Hair of the dog?

27:52.237 --> 27:53.499
Duty calls. Gotta work.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.036
Well...

27:59.177 --> 28:01.236
Ah!

28:01.413 --> 28:03.040
Cady, it's 6:30 in the mornin'.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.443
I made coffee.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.983
What's goin' on?

28:11.423 --> 28:15.883
I'm a single, highly educated woman
in the middle of Wyoming...

28:16.094 --> 28:18.324
...with absolutely no career
to speak of.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.499
My dad and my ex-boyfriend
are in a nasty campaign fight.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.861
And recently
I found out that my mother...

28:25.603 --> 28:26.729
Your mother what?

28:40.118 --> 28:42.382
- Is this about Denver?
- No.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.781
You should go.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.755
I should be right here.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.458
This is where I should be.

28:53.965 --> 28:55.933
My mom didn't die of cancer.

29:08.446 --> 29:11.074
[Dogs barking]

29:11.349 --> 29:13.010
Thanks for meeting me, Mathias.

29:13.218 --> 29:16.244
What do you want
with Mancell Lone Elk?

29:16.387 --> 29:17.820
Same as you.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.751
Answers.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.926
[Mathias] Ethan's dead. His brother's
been labeled a terrorist.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.189
Now, you want to harass his father?

29:27.398 --> 29:30.026
Hasn't the family
suffered enough, Walt?

29:30.268 --> 29:32.759
I appreciate your concern, Mathias...

29:32.937 --> 29:34.996
...but the Sheriff's
just doin' his job.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.371
Probably not for long.

29:39.978 --> 29:43.675
Mr. Lone Elk... must've been a
difficult job for your son, Ethan...

29:43.882 --> 29:46.316
...to tell people
he'd known his entire life...

29:46.518 --> 29:49.351
...they're not getting
these high-paying casino jobs.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.488
It was not easy on him.

29:52.390 --> 29:56.724
But I taught my sons
never to choose the easy path.

29:56.928 --> 29:58.327
You did a fine job with 'em.

29:59.864 --> 30:04.062
Must've been even harder on Ethan,
when you failed the drug test.

30:04.269 --> 30:07.432
This is a tribal elder
you're speaking to, Walt.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.534
How hard was that on you, Mancell?

30:12.377 --> 30:17.542
Rejection... stirs hard feelings
in the soul.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.974
When I failed that test, I was angry.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.313
And I was ashamed.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.489
What I should have been was proud.

30:26.457 --> 30:31.793
I raised my two sons to follow truth,
so they could not be corrupted.

30:32.697 --> 30:35.427
Where were you two nights ago
when your son was killed?

30:35.633 --> 30:38.193
He was leading an NA meeting
at the rez centre.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.496
The one my sister attends.

30:45.210 --> 30:48.771
I was clean
since Ethan gave me that test.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.549
I wanted to show him...

30:51.749 --> 30:54.582
...that I was worthy
of callin' myself his father again.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.947
You have no issue
with your son failing you?

30:57.155 --> 30:59.419
Ethan didn't fail me. I failed him.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.819
But you do have some issues
with his wife.

31:03.828 --> 31:07.992
I choose not to recognize that woman
as Ethan's spouse!

31:08.233 --> 31:10.827
- Because she's black.
- Because she's not Cheyenne!

31:12.103 --> 31:15.334
When a child chooses to be
with someone you don't approve of...

31:17.141 --> 31:18.631
...feels like rejection.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.003
Makes you angry.

31:21.346 --> 31:23.007
And anger leads to bad decisions.

31:23.181 --> 31:26.344
How could I do that to my own son?
My own son?

31:26.584 --> 31:30.247
Who knows what you'd do, if
you were high on this? Is this meth?

31:30.488 --> 31:34.015
That's not mine. I took it off one
of our members at the NA meeting.

31:34.092 --> 31:37.061
You are an elder.
You said you were clean.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.323
Lying is the easy path.

31:43.167 --> 31:47.627
When I heard about Ethan...
I bought a quarter-ounce!

31:48.740 --> 31:51.208
Without his expectations
to live up to...

31:52.243 --> 31:54.609
...you tell me. Why the hell bother?

31:54.812 --> 31:56.473
Why the hell bother?

31:59.617 --> 32:03.109
So who's gonna cuff him, Sheriff?
You or me?

32:04.555 --> 32:07.217
[Crowd shouting]

32:07.392 --> 32:09.587
[Sean] You really think
you should go in today?

32:09.794 --> 32:11.921
[Vic] I have to go in.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.121
- Well, I'm walking you to the door.
- No.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.997
No, that'd make things worse.
They know we're married.

32:18.202 --> 32:21.569
"Newett Energy and the Sheriff's
Department are in bed together."

32:22.140 --> 32:23.903
Wait. Who said that? Walt?

32:25.209 --> 32:26.506
No.

32:27.378 --> 32:29.938
Dolan Lone Elk,
right before the FBI grabbed him.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.616
So you're influenced by a terrorist.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.682
Why would you call him a terrorist?

32:36.054 --> 32:40.423
Because that's basically what he is.
Babe, look what he's done to Durant.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.685
Look what he did
at our headquarters the other day.

32:43.895 --> 32:46.159
Please tell me you didn't call
the FBI on him.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.524
The heat is off your company.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.531
The whistle-blower is in custody...

32:51.736 --> 32:54.204
...and you're using
the same language as the FBI.

32:55.206 --> 32:59.905
Victoria, the FBI debriefed my boss
on the situation.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.601
I was forwarded a memo.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.839
They referred to him as a terrorist.
That's it.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.511
I'd like to see that memo.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.518
Just what kind of man
do you think I am?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.829
Where's Mancell Lone Elk?

33:24.035 --> 33:26.868
Thought he'd be safer with Mathias.

33:27.038 --> 33:29.666
[Crowd shouting]

33:29.841 --> 33:32.139
I'm going to work. Get out of my way!

33:32.343 --> 33:34.504
All of you, move back!

33:35.613 --> 33:36.613
Stay back!

33:38.516 --> 33:40.507
Ruby! Stay back!

33:41.919 --> 33:44.012
Get back! Grab her.

33:52.997 --> 33:54.464
Is she all right?

33:54.632 --> 33:57.396
She got a bit roughed up. She's fine.

33:58.636 --> 33:59.796
They seem pretty upset.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.531
Why don't you go down there
and ask 'em to leave?

34:02.707 --> 34:05.574
Introduce yourself.
You haven't been around much.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.804
Don't you wanna know
about the paint?

34:10.014 --> 34:13.074
Found the shade of red
painted on Ethan Lone Elk.

34:13.284 --> 34:17.414
Tuscan red. None of the chain stores
could recall any buyers.

34:17.655 --> 34:21.523
I did get about 20 names by hittin'
the mom-and-pop stores in the county.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.125
Mancell's name on that list?

34:27.831 --> 34:29.766
Why don't you read it and find out?

34:36.107 --> 34:38.940
Branch got a match on the paint.
A list of buyers.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.634
Mancell's not on that list.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.280
But that doesn't mean
he didn't have the paint.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.346
We need
to cross-check the buyers...

34:45.449 --> 34:47.940
...with everyone
that failed Ethan's drug tests.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.777
And cross-check with the employees
of Newett Energy, as well.

34:51.289 --> 34:54.746
[Crowd shouting]

34:54.926 --> 34:57.417
I need to talk to Dolan Lone Elk.

34:57.628 --> 35:01.587
He may be more forthcoming now that
he's the FBI's number-one suspect.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.632
Dolan's in FBI custody.
How are you gonna talk to him?

35:06.003 --> 35:07.527
Ask nicely.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.770
Where did everybody go?

35:13.978 --> 35:16.640
Home. Nobody left
to supervise their training.

35:16.914 --> 35:20.543
After Walt questioned her,
Lauryn Lone Elk quit.

35:20.751 --> 35:25.279
On the bright side, he is suffering
the worst political week of his term.

35:25.423 --> 35:28.119
The two biggest job creators
in the area are reeling.

35:28.326 --> 35:31.022
Half the county
thinks Walt's coddling the natives.

35:31.229 --> 35:34.824
Other half thinks
he's in Newett Energy's pocket.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.059
With all due respect
to Ethan Lone Elk...

35:37.268 --> 35:39.862
...he couldn't have picked
a better time to die.

35:40.071 --> 35:42.437
Yeah, well, I still have a job to do.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.608
I can't keep my hands clean forever.

35:45.376 --> 35:48.937
No, you certainly can't. Especially
if you wanna win this thing.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.816
Even with all of Walt's
sudden political radioactivity...

35:53.017 --> 35:54.712
...the election's gonna be close.

35:54.919 --> 35:58.616
There's gotta be a better way
to tip this thing in my favor.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.257
You know what would help? Dirt.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.157
On Walt or his family.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.455
If you got
any juicy Longmire secrets...

36:06.664 --> 36:08.529
...now would be the time
to spill 'em.

36:22.246 --> 36:25.545
This is a closed crime scene.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

36:25.750 --> 36:29.516
- Is Dolan still in your custody?
- Mr. Lone Elk is answering questions.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.688
I have a few of my own
I'd like to ask him.

36:31.889 --> 36:33.151
Such as?

36:33.357 --> 36:35.120
About some folks on this list.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.987
People his brother
denied casino jobs to.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.687
See if he knows of anyone
making threats against Ethan.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.422
So you wanna ask the suspect...

36:42.633 --> 36:45.193
...if he thinks you should pin this
on someone else?

36:45.937 --> 36:49.668
Why don't you let me have that list?
I'd be happy to ask Dolan myself.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.206
No. I'll hold on to this.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.469
If I can't talk to Dolan, I'll run
these names by some neighbors.

37:01.018 --> 37:02.451
You get kicked out?

37:03.621 --> 37:06.055
Yeah. What are you doin' here?

37:06.857 --> 37:08.791
Followin' up on Mancell Lone Elk.

37:08.993 --> 37:11.188
Searched his house. No red paint.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.193
So now I'm hopin'
to talk to Dolan about his father.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.696
Hope you have more luck than I did.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.664
Who lives over there?

37:18.869 --> 37:21.531
Grady Littlefoot and his brothers.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.440
Here we go.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.451
You here to punish us for exercising
our right to free speech?

37:36.687 --> 37:38.348
It's a free country.

37:40.491 --> 37:44.291
I hear there's another protest at
a fracking rig going on right now.

37:44.495 --> 37:47.396
Why aren't you there?
You have a change of heart?

37:47.565 --> 37:50.193
Can't protest every dumb thing
the white man does.

37:50.401 --> 37:52.335
Wouldn't have time
for home and gardening.

37:52.670 --> 37:56.731
- [Chuckles] You lookin' to sell?
- We were.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.273
Then gas started leaking
out of the faucets.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.944
Then the neighbor's house blows up.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.547
We could turn this place
into the Taj Mahal.

38:04.882 --> 38:06.349
Nobody would buy it.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.711
That's a tough break.

38:08.853 --> 38:12.186
Especially since you all
just got turned down for a job.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.585
Names are right here
on this list of folks...

38:14.792 --> 38:16.919
...that didn't pass
the casino drug test.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.527
Must've got under your skin.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.357
Yeah, we don't snort coke or do meth.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.533
- You did fail the drug test.
- For peyote.

38:23.701 --> 38:26.465
That's no drug. That's our heritage.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.140
Ethan Lone Elk
wouldn't cut you any slack...

38:31.375 --> 38:33.707
...for observing
sacred religious rituals.

38:33.844 --> 38:37.177
Ethan was a self-righteous prick.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.815
He came back here after 20 years.

38:40.017 --> 38:43.646
Started driving his white man's car,
waving his white man's diploma...

38:43.821 --> 38:46.153
...showin' off his black man's wife.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.815
It was like, suddenly,
he thought he was someone.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.961
He'd pull up
over to Dolan's place...

38:52.196 --> 38:54.721
...and we'd call him over,
invite him to a drink...

38:54.932 --> 38:57.492
...and he would just stand there
like he was afraid.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.762
So you weren't too heartbroken
about what happened to Ethan.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.030
He deserved what happened.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.837
White man's company blows up
the whitest Indian I ever seen.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.646
What do you call that?
Poetic justice?

39:09.814 --> 39:12.305
I'd call that somethin' else.

39:12.483 --> 39:15.850
See, Ethan was dead
before that house ignited.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.950
And his body was covered in paint.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.021
Tuscan red.

39:23.227 --> 39:24.888
It matches the stripes on your car.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.893
You tryin' to accuse us of somethin'?

39:27.098 --> 39:29.066
I'm still workin' on it.

39:29.233 --> 39:30.928
[Grunts]

39:32.403 --> 39:34.268
Here's what I got so far.

39:36.073 --> 39:38.166
I think you asked Ethan
over for a drink...

39:38.376 --> 39:40.401
...but you didn't take no
for an answer.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.512
I think you grabbed Ethan
and dragged him here.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.683
Held him down
and forced booze down his throat...

39:46.884 --> 39:48.511
...and painted him Tuscan red.

39:48.719 --> 39:53.622
Just so he'd remember, no matter
how many diplomas he had, Ethan...

39:55.292 --> 39:57.726
...would always be
a red-skinned drunk.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.930
After you forced him
to drink himself to death...

40:01.132 --> 40:03.191
...you took him
to his brother's house.

40:03.367 --> 40:06.063
You opened the taps,
closed the doors...

40:06.971 --> 40:10.702
...and blew the place to bits
to cover up what you'd done.

40:11.442 --> 40:14.343
All because Ethan
had made himself into somebody.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.414
But you...

40:20.551 --> 40:22.314
...were still just you.

40:22.486 --> 40:24.249
[Grunting]

40:26.090 --> 40:28.820
Unless you wanna see
if your blood is Tuscan red...

40:29.026 --> 40:30.823
...I'd think twice about that.

40:42.239 --> 40:46.266
I heard that information I gave you
about the house paint came in handy.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.745
Sorry. I forgot
to bring you your trophy.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.048
Should I step out,
so you can measure the blinds?

40:57.054 --> 41:00.455
- So, Walt, how's Cady?
- Cady's fine.

41:00.624 --> 41:04.526
That's funny
'cause I don't think she is.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.124
I think she's feelin' lost and alone.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.667
And I think deep down...
she's angry...

41:12.837 --> 41:16.603
...because she put her entire life
on hold for you when you needed her.

41:16.774 --> 41:20.232
And now that the tables have turned
and she needs you...

41:21.445 --> 41:24.107
...you're too busy bein' Sheriff
to even notice.

41:24.782 --> 41:28.081
Not only do you think
you'd be a better sheriff than me...

41:29.587 --> 41:33.853
...you think you can walk in here
and tell me how to be a father?

41:33.958 --> 41:35.425
Walt...

41:36.527 --> 41:38.495
...I know what happened in Denver.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.430
No, you don't.

41:46.737 --> 41:48.500
If this were just about you and me...

41:48.672 --> 41:51.436
...you'd be readin' it in the paper
tomorrow morning.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.434
But this isn't just about you and me.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.847
So word of your wife's murder
won't leave this room.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.814
I can promise you that.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.852
But I think
you should consider the idea...

42:07.057 --> 42:10.185
...that, right now...
your daughter might need you...

42:10.394 --> 42:12.919
...more than the county does.

42:22.339 --> 42:25.069
