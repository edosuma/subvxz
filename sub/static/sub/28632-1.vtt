WEBVTT

02:00.946 --> 02:02.600
It doesn't look good,
Richard.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.430
In fact, to be quite frank,
it looks pretty bad.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.129
Rather than beat
around the bush,

02:09.172 --> 02:10.869
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.307
Richard, you have stage four
lung cancer.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.354
The pain you've been
experiencing in your upper back

02:17.398 --> 02:19.574
is actually the result
of malignant tumors

02:19.617 --> 02:20.879
within your lungs,

02:20.923 --> 02:24.448
which it sadly appears
you have for some time.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.625
As we're catching this late
in the game,

02:28.278 --> 02:31.063
your cancer has also had
the opportunity to spread

02:31.629 --> 02:34.023
specifically to your spine,
and adrenals.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.202
You wanna put in notice
with the college.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.074
You should notify Veronica
and your daughter

02:42.118 --> 02:46.340
as soon as possible as treatment
will begin immediately.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.777
How long are we talking?

02:48.820 --> 02:51.171
With treatment, a year,

02:51.997 --> 02:53.782
a year and a half,
if you're lucky.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.002
And without?

02:58.613 --> 03:00.441
Probably six months.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.184
I am so sorry, Richard.

03:32.995 --> 03:33.996
Fuck.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.271
So let's make this
a fantastic quarter.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.492
We get that extra
little bit of funding

03:51.535 --> 03:53.581
that we so desperately need.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.759
Uh, any questions?

04:05.375 --> 04:06.724
Fuck.

04:08.465 --> 04:11.599
What...? Uhm... Okay.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.748
Fuck.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.158
Jesus fucking Jesus.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.378
Jesus. God. Fuck.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.901
Fucking bastard!

04:52.944 --> 04:55.077
Fuck! Jesus!

04:55.773 --> 04:57.297
Fuck it, huh?

04:57.601 --> 04:59.386
Fucking God!

04:59.734 --> 05:00.996
Fuck you!

05:08.308 --> 05:09.309
Fuck you.

05:24.976 --> 05:25.977
Fuck.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.031
Shall the atheist
say grace then?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.249
Shut up, Richard.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.035
Of course, my dear.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.081
I actually have something
I wanna say.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.347
Go ahead, kid. What do you got?

05:50.698 --> 05:52.613
I wanted you to know
that I'm gay.

05:53.004 --> 05:56.617
What on Earth?

05:56.660 --> 05:58.706
Jesus Christ.

05:58.749 --> 06:01.317
Olivia, I thought
it was something bad.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.015
No, you're not, Olive.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.455
What do you mean I'm not?

06:08.498 --> 06:10.326
You're not gay. I mean,
you're not a lesbian.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.936
-Yeah, I am.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.679
Yeah. No, I think I'd know
my own sexual preference.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.812
Uh, it's just a phase.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.031
I, for one,
think it's fantastic.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.337
Don't placate her.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.817
I'm not placating my daughter.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.862
How dare you deny me
like this.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.603
I'm not denying you, sweetheart.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.214
I'm just denying your call
for attention

06:29.258 --> 06:31.347
or whatever else this is.
That's all.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.090
I know you, Olive,
better than you know yourself.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.049
No, mother.
You know no shit about me.

06:40.748 --> 06:44.099
Olivia, please come back,
sweetheart. Olivia.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.014
Let her go.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.760
Your finesse of parenting...

06:54.805 --> 06:56.981
has always amazed me.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.556
I also have something
I'd like to say.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.820
I can't wait.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.651
I'm having an affair.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.787
I'm having an affair
and I thought you should know.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.793
And why did you think
I should know?

07:28.012 --> 07:29.492
Because it's with Henry.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.581
Henry who?

07:33.583 --> 07:34.758
Henry Wright.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.804
-Henry Wright?
-Uh-hmm.

07:36.847 --> 07:37.848
My boss?

07:46.291 --> 07:49.991
No, no, no, no. Veronica.
That's real revolting.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.994
Are you out of your mind?
Come on.

07:53.037 --> 07:56.388
At least have a little bit
of taste in your infidelity.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.916
It's up to you, but I'd fucked
a pool boy myself or a plumber.

08:02.307 --> 08:05.702
Then had some fucking
nutless sack.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.617
I assure you
it's not empty.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.706
What?

08:10.533 --> 08:12.927
Henry has been blessed
with a spare testicle.

08:13.971 --> 08:18.976
Henry was blessed
with a spare testicle?

08:21.022 --> 08:24.416
Are you sure it's not a cyst
or a cancerous growth?

08:25.243 --> 08:26.288
Do you even care?

08:26.897 --> 08:28.420
About his third nut?

08:29.900 --> 08:32.555
No. No, I don't.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.733
As far as I'm concerned,
that real estate's

08:36.777 --> 08:39.736
lost its value long ago.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.262
You're such an ass.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.787
Self-admitted.

08:50.268 --> 08:53.402
So let us drink
to our holy matrimony.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.795
Drink by yourself.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.187
Much better idea.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.756
Ugh. What was it you wanted
to tell us?

09:04.674 --> 09:08.112
I was, uh,
afraid I overcooked the steaks.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.074
Such an asshole.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.126
No, but that's not
what she's saying at all.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.390
She's laying the groundwork
for the whole feminist movement.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.523
Go on.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.222
Like a hundred years
in advance and--

09:34.095 --> 09:35.357
What was that?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.577
Oh.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.754
Aren't you gonna do anything?

09:41.929 --> 09:42.930
Like what?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.672
I don't know. Call someone.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.283
Were you friends with it?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.198
Did you know it personally,
by, like, by name?

09:50.241 --> 09:51.416
It's a fucking bird.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.375
I don't know who to call.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.160
-Can I continue?
-No, you may not.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.209
Oh, whose phone is it?
Is that your phone?

10:01.252 --> 10:02.253
Shit.

10:02.645 --> 10:03.864
There we go. Here she is.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.039
Sorry.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.867
Mine. Sorry.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.913
Um, I thought
it was on vibrate but it's...

10:10.218 --> 10:11.567
No, no, no, please,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.613
take your call.
Stand up and take your call.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.094
Please. Don't be shy.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.183
Stand up and take your call.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.452
Hello.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.499
I'm gonna call you back actually
because I'm in class.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.241
No, as in I'm in class.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.245
Right now. I'm standing up.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.030
-I know it's weird. Okay.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.858
Goodbye. Bye. Bye.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.948
Fascinating.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.297
I'm sorry.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.125
Oh, don't be.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.302
Okay.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.436
From here on out,

10:54.479 --> 10:56.656
we're gonna do things
very, very differently.

10:57.482 --> 11:00.442
So for those of you who are not
even remotely interested

11:00.485 --> 11:01.922
in being here, please leave.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.750
Just simply walk out the door

11:04.402 --> 11:06.535
and you'll receive
an automatic C.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.104
I no longer have time
to be wasted

11:10.452 --> 11:12.628
nor do I intend
on wasting yours.

11:12.933 --> 11:17.111
So for those of you
who receive grades of,

11:17.154 --> 11:20.984
say, a C or worse,
let's just be proactive.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.726
Pack up your shit.
And vamos now.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.423
Hmm?

11:27.948 --> 11:29.819
Good. Here we go.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.781
If any of you
have any intentions

11:34.824 --> 11:38.219
of studying business,
get the fuck out now.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.003
I'm not gonna say it again.

11:40.395 --> 11:44.660
If you look down and you happen
to find yourself in sweatpants

11:44.704 --> 11:48.316
or rather pants with
the drawstring or something,

11:49.056 --> 11:51.014
-just please leave.
- What?

11:51.058 --> 11:54.714
Most important of all,
if you've never read a book

11:54.757 --> 11:57.107
for our own internal pleasure...

11:58.369 --> 12:00.110
you don't belong here.
Get out.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.244
If any of you find yourself

12:03.287 --> 12:05.725
falling into
any of these categories.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.989
I assure you,
you will not do better than a C.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.428
Here we go.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.607
The government workers
and the politicians included.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.873
The, uh, sweatpants comment
is not a joke.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.616
I'm sick. I have a cold.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.451
Right. Now, for those of you
who are interested

12:36.494 --> 12:38.409
in learning from greater minds,

12:39.671 --> 12:41.325
and there are today,

12:42.109 --> 12:44.589
you're in charge of reading
one book

12:44.633 --> 12:46.374
and one book only
to this quarter.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.159
After doing so,
you will then stand up here

12:49.203 --> 12:51.031
and you will run a class
of your own.

12:52.815 --> 12:57.428
Excellent. There go the kings
and queens of the water cooler,

12:58.255 --> 13:00.170
corporate whores of tomorrow.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.785
C. Maybe not.

13:07.264 --> 13:11.268
And then you will stand up here
and you'll persuade your peers

13:12.139 --> 13:14.445
of the work's importance.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.100
For that, you'll receive a B.

13:18.580 --> 13:21.888
If you teach us something new,
you receive an A.

13:23.846 --> 13:24.891
Any questions?

13:26.457 --> 13:27.458
Um...

13:28.938 --> 13:31.680
Ah-ha. Yes. One more thing.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.336
No feminist or queer propaganda.

13:35.379 --> 13:39.122
The plight of unkempt women
is truly the last thing

13:39.166 --> 13:41.168
I would like to think about
right now.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.518
I don't think
you can do that.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.476
- I just did.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.784
And now, I shall embark
on an emotional...

13:49.829 --> 13:51.482
bender for 72 hours.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.311
Most likely,
I'll be drinking alone

13:54.659 --> 13:56.139
and I'm all right with that.

13:56.183 --> 13:59.142
So as a result,
class is cancelled.

14:01.753 --> 14:02.754
That's it.

14:03.843 --> 14:04.931
Class dismissed.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.543
Oh, yeah, by the way,
if any of you sell marijuana

14:08.586 --> 14:11.024
or you know anyone who does,
would you please visit me

14:11.067 --> 14:12.460
during office hours?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.027
Thanks. Bye.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.860
What the fuck?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.993
I need to go on sabbatical
next quarter.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.954
I would... No, I can't give you
a sabbatical, it takes a year.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.694
A year to get
that kind of thing done.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.653
You're gonna have to do
something to speed it up.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.350
No, I can't.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.396
What do you want
to go on a sabbatical for?

14:35.700 --> 14:39.835
I would like to write
the next great American novel.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.445
-Oh, yeah?
-Or novela,

14:41.489 --> 14:44.057
-depending on the length.
-What's it about?

14:44.971 --> 14:46.537
It's gonna be about an orphan

14:46.798 --> 14:49.627
who raises rabbits or bunnies
around there.

14:49.671 --> 14:50.890
And what's it called?

14:52.282 --> 14:54.632
Right now, the tentative title
is Bunny Fun Found

14:55.024 --> 14:56.939
because her name is Bunny
and oddly enough,

14:56.983 --> 14:58.680
-she was having fun...
-You're full of shit.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.290
You're full of shit.
You're having me on.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.163
-I have cancer, Peter.
-What?

15:03.206 --> 15:06.253
I have cancer
and it doesn't get look good.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.517
Jesus Christ, Richard.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.695
I don't want to die here.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.131
I don't wanna die here
like this.

15:15.175 --> 15:18.700
Please get me out.
Just let me die alone.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.049
Let me die in peace.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.183
Oh, Richard.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.533
No hands above the table.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.577
Okay.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.841
What kind of cancer is it?

15:30.407 --> 15:31.931
It's, uh, it's lung cancer.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.062
You don't smoke.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.109
No. I can now.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.894
Listen, this is what happens
to everybody.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.069
It's what happens to all of us.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.985
I mean, you could be ridden
with the same damn thing.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.595
Why would you say something
like that to me, huh?

15:44.639 --> 15:46.858
No, no. I'm making a point.
I'm sorry. It came out wrong.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.773
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-That's allright.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.297
There you go.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.257
I really hate
these effeminate glasses.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.439
What are we gonna do?

16:05.225 --> 16:07.270
I'm gonna fill
my medicine cabinet.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.663
And...

16:10.360 --> 16:11.840
I'm gonna ride this thing out.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.146
Wait, you're not gonna
get treatments?

16:13.189 --> 16:14.190
No.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.543
Oh.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.068
-You owe me, Peter.
-Uh, yes.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.070
Yes. Yes, of course.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.114
Thank you.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.944
You can let go of my hands now

16:28.988 --> 16:30.859
and then we can have a drink
maybe.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.469
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.431
So to the months end.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.737
To your health.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.435
There's no need to be facetious.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.176
I didn't mean to be facetious.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.439
And don't go blabbering

16:45.482 --> 16:46.788
your little wet mouth
about this.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.051
-No, no.
-This is no one's business.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.313
-but my own
-Of course.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.315
- I think your art is

16:52.837 --> 16:54.839
brilliant, stunning,

16:55.405 --> 16:56.972
and a wonderful investment.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.540
In fact...

17:02.673 --> 17:04.327
could you do the whole campus?

17:05.502 --> 17:07.896
-Certainly with your talent--
-To the College of Florida?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.117
That's my responsibility.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.770
You don't need to worry
about that.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
To your latest infidelity.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.127
And your honorable cuckolding.

17:23.694 --> 17:24.782
Hmm-hmm.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.177
Ooh, what's that?

17:28.569 --> 17:30.658
It's a white oblong pill.

17:30.701 --> 17:31.702
Where did you get it?

17:34.096 --> 17:36.359
We're well-to-do
middle-aged wasps.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.058
We can get prescriptions
for anything we want, darling.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.148
Okay.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.805
If you behave yourself...

17:48.806 --> 17:50.895
I'll give you
a blue triangular one next.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.202
I heard you're quite fond
of them.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.036
Onto serious matters.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.734
-Go for it.
-And you know at heart,

18:04.735 --> 18:06.607
I don't give a damn
about you and Henry.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.132
You do whatever you please.
But you have to realize

18:10.176 --> 18:13.570
that from here on out,
I'll be living just as freely.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.879
I've played a rather quiet role

18:17.922 --> 18:19.837
in the tragedy
that is our marriage.

18:19.881 --> 18:20.925
and...

18:21.926 --> 18:24.929
quite frankly, I'm done.

18:25.843 --> 18:29.151
It's time that we lived a bit
closer to the...

18:29.499 --> 18:30.805
primal truth of it all.

18:32.285 --> 18:36.115
So from this point on,
let us fuck who we wanna fuck.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.248
Let us ingest
what we wanna ingest.

18:39.727 --> 18:44.166
And all in all, just do whatever
the hell we damn well please.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.733
Here, here.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.127
One request,

18:50.129 --> 18:51.782
that we do so discretely.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.612
Let us at least attempt to keep
the parental damage

18:55.656 --> 18:58.876
to our sweet lesbian love child
to a minimum.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.965
I wholeheartedly agree.

19:01.575 --> 19:05.448
Wonderful.
And the matter is settled.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.497
Richard?

19:10.801 --> 19:11.802
Yes, dear?

19:13.021 --> 19:15.806
Dare I ask
if your equipment still works?

19:16.677 --> 19:17.895
I don't know.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.942
I mean, sadly, it's laid dormant
for years.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.469
But if it doesn't, it's just
one more prescription to fill.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.257
Here's to, uh, our new lives.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.520
And your new freedoms.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.784
Now, hand over a blue one
I've behaved myself admirably.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.352
He was like this, um...

19:39.830 --> 19:43.530
17th century poet who fell
in love with his cousin and...

19:44.835 --> 19:46.794
-...fell in love
with his cousin?
-Oh, shit.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.796
You're such
an asshole.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.319
- What?
-My parents are home.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.538
Hey. It's okay.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.496
Can you promise
not to judge me?

19:53.757 --> 19:56.107
Don't worry, seriously.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.633
- It's broken.
-Hmm.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.939
I mean,
the whole thing is broken.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.683
- That's .

20:07.554 --> 20:10.339
Oh, Olivia. Look, dear.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.124
-It's Olivia and company.
-What's going on?

20:13.603 --> 20:15.910
Uh, your mom
broke the lamp.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.696
Are you all right?

20:19.740 --> 20:21.959
Yes, darling.
Of course, why wouldn't we be?

20:22.003 --> 20:23.787
Because you seem like
you're drunk or on drugs.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.442
Admittedly,
we are on a bit of both.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.011
But don't let that influence
your decisions.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.621
Oh,
don't listen to him.

20:31.665 --> 20:35.146
They're just prescriptions.
I'm Veronica, Olivia's mother.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.278
Hi, I'm Taylor.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.758
Oh, nice to meet you...

20:38.541 --> 20:39.847
Excuse me.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.502
Careful, dear.
Let's not exert yourself.

20:43.590 --> 20:46.288
So is this--is she...

20:46.332 --> 20:47.855
Taylor is Taylor,
mother.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.683
Yes, yes, of course, you are.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.990
And by the way, I'm Richard.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.038
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes, please, come.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.692
-Join us for a drink.
-No, hang on. No.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.955
You're being very creepy.
We're going.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.478
-Creepy?
- Yes.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.219
We're just
having fun.

21:04.437 --> 21:05.612
Come on.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.135
Hey, well, it was very nice
meeting you.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.571
- Bye.
-Nice to meet you.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.662
That was pleasant.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.014
So how do you think that went?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.539
On a scale
of one to ten,

21:19.582 --> 21:21.105
I'd say a four.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.065
Agreed.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.373
I'm only mildly disappointed
in myself.

21:28.243 --> 21:31.507
I feel ashamed. Yeah.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.859
What happened
to us, Richard?

21:36.686 --> 21:38.166
What happened to us?

21:40.124 --> 21:41.125
Life.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.867
You know,
if I could go back in time,

21:43.911 --> 21:46.305
I don't even know what it is
I'm supposed to fix.

21:47.654 --> 21:50.396
Oh, I could readily
think of many things.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.311
I didn't ask you.

21:52.963 --> 21:53.921
True.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.054
You're gonna break
all our wedding presents.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.535
Did you ever notice
that they're all hollow?

21:59.796 --> 22:01.320
Ah, what does that mean?

22:02.756 --> 22:03.757
It doesn't matter.

22:09.632 --> 22:10.938
Richard?

22:12.069 --> 22:13.114
Yes, dear?

22:14.637 --> 22:16.465
Thank you for helping me.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.817
Of course.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.952
Holding your hair back
has always been

22:24.995 --> 22:26.823
one of my life's great honors.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.477
I'm serious.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.045
In ways, so am I.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.009
Do you think Olivia hates me?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.361
Yes.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.320
But she's supposed to.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.500
I'm not a bad person.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.026
I know you're not, Veronica.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.683
No one ever said you were.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.782
Well, you are a...

23:13.261 --> 23:15.829
relatively attractive
group of kids.

23:16.177 --> 23:19.354
I mean, I see a few
weak chins here and there.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.270
But, uh, I think that's probably
just due to some

23:22.313 --> 23:25.229
fine New England breeding. Hmm?

23:25.273 --> 23:28.145
Beautiful mother, rich father,

23:28.189 --> 23:30.626
cold winter, that kind of thing.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.803
Do you smoke?

23:34.500 --> 23:35.501
No.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.198
You look like you do.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.721
I do, Mr. Brown.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.506
Would you mind if I have one?

23:40.897 --> 23:42.159
No, not at all.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.642
So, um...

23:47.295 --> 23:50.385
let's go through
and introduce ourselves.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.040
Any volunteers?

23:54.433 --> 23:57.348
I'll go first.
My name is Richard.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.438
I'm your professor. Go ahead.

24:12.407 --> 24:13.408
Wow.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.541
That was fucking wretched.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.153
Jesus.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.894
Okay.

24:21.764 --> 24:22.852
Who's next?

24:26.421 --> 24:27.509
How about you?

24:28.292 --> 24:30.599
-Me?
-Yeah, you,

24:30.860 --> 24:32.035
girl with the phone.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.385
Who are you,

24:34.864 --> 24:36.257
why should we know you,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.738
what do you want to do
with your life?

24:40.609 --> 24:41.610
Okay.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.483
I'm Claire.

24:46.267 --> 24:47.790
I'm from Upstate New York.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.446
Why you should know me?

24:54.275 --> 24:55.711
I don't know.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.496
Yeah. I don't know.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.980
I guess because my uncle
is the president of the school.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.983
Ew. Henry Wright is your uncle?

25:07.418 --> 25:09.856
-Yes.
-I can't stand the fuck.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.512
I don't really like him either.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.470
That's very good to hear.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.342
I mean, he's so peach melba.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.519
Just slimy and...

25:22.390 --> 25:23.565
I've got an idea.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.002
How about we put
a little pause to this shit

25:27.003 --> 25:29.005
and we go down to the bar,

25:29.049 --> 25:31.181
and we can run over it there.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.183
My biological father
actually met my mothers

25:33.227 --> 25:35.882
at a monthly compost meeting
in Boston.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.362
He's this social anthropologist
over at a--

25:38.406 --> 25:40.843
Okay. Rose,

25:41.235 --> 25:44.020
go and grab two more pitchers
for everybody, would you?

25:44.717 --> 25:46.632
Why don't you just put them
in your tab?

25:46.675 --> 25:48.155
No, that's not the point.

25:48.198 --> 25:50.592
See, I want you to go
and get them.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.681
And I want you go
and get them now, please?

25:53.682 --> 25:54.857
Can I get some hummus?

25:55.249 --> 25:56.816
Yeah, get some hummus.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.646
Thank you.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.997
Let me give you all
a piece of advice.

26:04.954 --> 26:09.132
Steer very clear of anyone
who has even the faintest,

26:09.176 --> 26:13.528
slightest whip
of intentional conception.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.356
I was conceived intentionally.

26:15.399 --> 26:16.966
Well, I need to know your name.

26:17.663 --> 26:21.231
By the way,
I hope your parents all told you

26:22.450 --> 26:24.408
that you fucking die at the end.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.498
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.849
You're gonna die. One day,

26:29.892 --> 26:33.417
even our blessed
little Rose will die.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.377
So, what I'm wondering is,
why the fuck

26:36.769 --> 26:40.860
do we sort of float
through this weird thing

26:40.903 --> 26:43.906
called life without living?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.169
You know, live.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.433
Don't exist. Don't simply exist.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.697
That's boring as fuck. Live.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.613
You know. Stir some shit up.
Fuck some shit up.

26:54.656 --> 27:00.923
Fuck it right. What I wanna
focus on is enriching our lives.

27:01.576 --> 27:04.057
And try to extract
some sort of wisdom

27:04.100 --> 27:05.711
that we can carry with us.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.409
You know, something other than
mommy and daddy's baggage.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.150
Ah, bless you, dear.

27:11.281 --> 27:14.589
You know, I'd wink at you
but I never learned how.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.593
So I just thought
you should know it.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.422
-Anybody want anything else?
-Yeah, could I get a whiskey?

27:21.465 --> 27:22.553
Oh, that's fine.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.035
She winked at me.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.689
I got the hummus, so...

27:27.733 --> 27:28.777
Christmas is saved.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.475
My God.

27:32.607 --> 27:33.652
Here we go.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.524
May we forever remember

27:36.567 --> 27:38.657
that in each and every moment,

27:38.700 --> 27:41.398
we are composing the stories
of our lives.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.707
Let's aim to make it
a meaningful read

27:46.099 --> 27:49.145
or at least,
an interesting one, yeah?

27:49.798 --> 27:51.278
All right. Cheers.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.410
Cheers.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.892
Now, if you will excuse me,

27:57.893 --> 28:00.940
I intend to explore
a smidgen of infidelity.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.073
What the fuck?

28:04.117 --> 28:05.509
All right, kids.
Have fun.

We can cover it all.
We could renovate science hall.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.481
We could bring in a new chair
to the English department.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.875

that goes without saying."

I'm sorry, what's your name
again, sweetheart?

29:18.452 --> 29:19.453
Sarah.

29:19.845 --> 29:20.889
Sarah.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.109
Be sure and leave Sarah
a healthy tip

I'll see you guys next week,
yeah?

29:27.983 --> 29:30.856
Oh, yeah, Rose. Let me
get you out of the way first.

29:31.247 --> 29:34.076
-So be prepared.
-But I don't know what to do.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.600
Moby Dick.
Moby Dick it is.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.428
Good idea. All right.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.126
Have a good one.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.914
He just picked up that waitress
in less than a minute.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.568
And fucked her in the bathroom.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.439
Yeah, well, they're both
consenting adults,

29:49.483 --> 29:50.919
so they can do
whatever they want.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.268
Cheers to that.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.276
Jibbles, Jibbles, Jibbles, look.

30:01.582 --> 30:04.063
Look, I feel mommy
is cheating.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.485
What's it say?

30:36.617 --> 30:37.661
It works.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.100
Let's go
try to stop him

30:41.143 --> 30:43.189
-from drinking so much.
- Oh. Peter, come on.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.494
He's having a good time.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.235
Ah, Richard,
you're looking rather sprite.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.063
Oh, I just had
unprotected sex.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.065
Oh, with who?

30:51.632 --> 30:53.460
Some very sweet girl from
the Lion's Pub. Hello, Donna.

30:53.939 --> 30:57.290
Oh, that's disgusting.
Why would he tell us that?

31:02.121 --> 31:03.122
So, how was your day,
sweetheart?

31:03.165 --> 31:04.166
Fine.

31:04.732 --> 31:07.126
-Good. Fine's fine.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.432
-How's Taylor?
-She's fine.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.912
That's even finer.

31:12.522 --> 31:15.221
Let us cheers
to a fine day all round.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.920
Hello.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.705
Hmm, Veronica.

31:23.403 --> 31:24.621
Sit down.

31:29.496 --> 31:30.671
Thank you.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.368
You're so welcome.

31:37.504 --> 31:41.334
Now, let's give this
another shot, shall we?

31:42.378 --> 31:46.556
Olivia, your mother
would like to apologize.

31:49.385 --> 31:52.649
Yes, I would like
to apologize...

31:54.303 --> 31:57.567
for my behavior
the other night.

31:58.829 --> 32:02.790
I don't know why my reaction
was so, um...

32:04.531 --> 32:05.575
I don't know.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.316
Right wing?

32:08.448 --> 32:09.579
Yes.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.021
I'm really sorry.

32:20.590 --> 32:21.591
Beautiful.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.944
Olivia, do you accept
your mother's apology?

32:28.816 --> 32:29.904
Sure.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.124
Well, good.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.518
The matter's settled.

32:36.867 --> 32:37.956
Bon appetit.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.873
So, Ishmael claims
that a journey around the world

32:42.917 --> 32:45.528
just brings you back to where
you were before you started,

32:45.572 --> 32:48.096
but this is actually coming from
a man, who's lost everything

32:48.140 --> 32:50.751
that's been his entire
reality and consciousness

32:50.794 --> 32:52.057
for the past few years...

32:52.100 --> 32:53.884
Do I look like
I'm getting some color?

32:53.928 --> 32:56.278
I don't know.
Hard to tell from here.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.152
It really feels like
I'm getting some color.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.111
Does anyone have any questions?

33:04.286 --> 33:06.897
What? Oh, uh, yes. Um...

33:07.942 --> 33:09.117
In a word?

33:10.597 --> 33:11.641
Vengeance.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.516
So, you liked it?

33:18.387 --> 33:20.563
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

33:21.651 --> 33:25.220
And yet, there were no broad
shouldered women lamenting,

33:25.264 --> 33:28.310
and sobbing out of second
story windows, were there?

33:28.658 --> 33:30.443
-No.
- Good.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.358
That means we're breaking down

33:32.401 --> 33:34.490
that co-op
personality of yours.

33:34.795 --> 33:38.451
I think we're probably gonna get
a bit of an edge out of you

33:38.494 --> 33:40.018
before the end of the quarter.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.062
Excuse me?

33:41.497 --> 33:42.846
You get an A minus.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.242
That's not a bad thing.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.290
Just give me one second, kids.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.856
I'm gonna have to take
one more look

33:52.900 --> 33:55.468
-at this artistic still born.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.645
Look at it, Jesus Christ,

33:58.688 --> 34:00.038
it's a boner.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.258
That is a gigantic boner.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.262
- Hi, honey.
-Isn't that your wife's work?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.090
Yeah, it is. It is.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.485
It doesn't mean I don't have
an opinion on the matter.

34:16.793 --> 34:17.925
Who is it?

34:18.186 --> 34:19.840
Uh, it's Daniel Wright.

34:20.449 --> 34:21.537
Come on in.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.066
Nice music.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.025
Thought you'd be listening
something different.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.375
Really, like what exactly?

34:33.723 --> 34:37.553
I don't know. Uh, Buddy Holly?

34:38.293 --> 34:40.556
Jesus, uh, uh,
how old do you think I am?

34:42.167 --> 34:43.559
Maybe around 60.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.519
That's fucking depressing.

34:46.823 --> 34:49.783
- I'm sorry. I...
-No. No. No.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.090
You spoke your mind,
it's all right. Come on in.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.309
Well, I brought you some pot.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.529
-No.
-Yeah.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.226
I made you some brownies.

34:59.967 --> 35:03.318
Wow. That's very kind of you.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.190
How, uh, how much do I owe you?

35:05.233 --> 35:06.930
It's on the house.
If you want more,

35:06.974 --> 35:08.845
we can talk prices later.

35:08.889 --> 35:12.110
Fuck me. Thank you very much.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.155
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.772
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.168
You mind if I ask you
something personal?

35:27.995 --> 35:29.214
No, go ahead.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.086
Have you ever been with a man?

35:37.352 --> 35:41.008
No. Nope. Nope. Nope.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.881
No, I can't say that I have.

35:45.273 --> 35:46.622

the work of one of the finest
contemporary artists of today,

37:03.003 --> 37:06.311
and someone that I am honored
to call a dear friend,

37:06.876 --> 37:11.272
Mrs. Veronica Sinclair Brown.
Well done.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.840
-It's blatantly foul.
- Beautiful.

37:13.883 --> 37:16.234
It's, uh, wonderful.

37:20.368 --> 37:21.848
Oh, that's great.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.764
May I ask what is it?

37:26.592 --> 37:27.549
It's a giant schmeckle.

37:29.595 --> 37:32.162
- Oh.
- There you go.

37:32.206 --> 37:35.035
Excellent. Well done.
- Hear, hear.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.993
- Beautiful.
- This is lovely.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.256
We appreciate it so much.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.953
We're lucky to have you.
Would you excuse me?

37:40.910 --> 37:42.390
-What do you think?
-Oh.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.524
Um, mom says I'm not allowed
to go to state schools.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.874
Your mom is not allowed
to say you're not allowed.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.572
It's probably best if you don't.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.008
Don't listen to him.
Listen to me.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.793
Splendid work, truly.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.534
-Thank you, Peter.
- Yeah.

37:55.577 --> 37:56.926
What do you think, Olive?

37:57.753 --> 37:59.755
The--uh, it was--yeah,
it was good.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.453
It's all right, yeah.

38:03.106 --> 38:06.196
So, shall we have
a celebratory drink?

38:06.240 --> 38:09.069
I'd love to, but Henry has me
going out to dinner

38:09.112 --> 38:11.724
with the benefactors.
It's an old money
from Connecticut.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.552
-Oh.
-I'll see you two at home.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.815
Bye, sweetie. Thanks, Peter.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.340
Are you sure you don't want

38:19.384 --> 38:20.776
a little splash of vodka
or brownie?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.562
Why are you and mom
still together?

38:23.605 --> 38:26.391
Yeah.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.350
That's a rather odd question.

38:29.742 --> 38:30.960
No, it's not.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.486
And I guess you're right,
we... um...

38:35.313 --> 38:36.792
I think as you get older,

38:38.533 --> 38:42.929
you, um, find yourself
needing someone

38:42.972 --> 38:45.801
to hold accountable for life

38:46.454 --> 38:49.675
not turning out exactly
as you'd imagined it.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.504
Jesus, dad.

38:52.939 --> 38:53.983
I know.

38:55.768 --> 38:59.641
But listen to me, not every
relationship has to be that.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.471
I mean, having said that,
most are.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.735
Okay.

39:07.606 --> 39:11.479
On that happy note.
How's it going with Taylor?

39:12.611 --> 39:14.003
It's going really well.

39:17.572 --> 39:20.619
Yeah? Good, that's good.

39:20.662 --> 39:21.837
That's very good.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.667
Are you in love?

39:32.021 --> 39:34.023
Yeah. I am.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.853
Wow. No shit.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.729
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,
sweetheart.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.993
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy for you.

39:48.821 --> 39:49.822
Thanks.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.743
You make sure
she understands your worth.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.008
- I know. She does.
-She better.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.489
She damn well better.

40:15.543 --> 40:16.979
Your daughter is in love.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.461
Did you tell her to be careful?

40:20.766 --> 40:21.767
No.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.119
Told her to enjoy herself.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.734
To realize one's destiny
is a person's only obligation.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.910
Uh, and so, uh, he begins
listening to the desert,

40:34.954 --> 40:37.391
and, uh discovering
the soul of the world,

40:37.652 --> 40:39.480
which then inevitably,
uh, leads us to--

40:39.524 --> 40:40.742
All right, stop.

40:41.743 --> 40:42.918
You get a B.

40:43.223 --> 40:45.268
-But I'm not finished.
-Take a seat.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.534
I thought it was great.

40:49.577 --> 40:50.752
Let me ask you a question.

40:52.145 --> 40:53.755
Are you guys getting anything
out of this shit?

40:54.103 --> 40:55.322
Yeah.

40:55.365 --> 40:58.107
Good. Because I have to say,
I am as well.

40:58.412 --> 41:01.981
I mean, you're all rather
a solid group of young adults,

41:02.024 --> 41:03.504
and I enjoy your company.

41:03.548 --> 41:07.247
Yeah. Yeah, uh, I'd say
we're all pretty mature.

41:08.030 --> 41:11.773
Well, maturity is really just
another word for...

41:12.295 --> 41:13.383
how much misery you'd swallow.

41:13.819 --> 41:15.037
Yeah, totally.

41:16.691 --> 41:17.431
I'm talking about the
piss and shit of others, Rose,

41:17.475 --> 41:18.650
not your own.

41:19.128 --> 41:20.739
Do you mind if I smoke a joint?

41:20.782 --> 41:22.218
Mm-mm.

41:22.828 --> 41:23.785
Um...

41:24.612 --> 41:25.613
Thanks.

41:27.049 --> 41:28.834
I'm more than happy to help,
uh, pick up his classes,

41:28.877 --> 41:30.792
if that helps at all.

41:33.316 --> 41:34.927
You got to be
kidding me.

41:35.623 --> 41:38.017
Is he smoking
a marijuana cigarette?

41:38.060 --> 41:41.542
Uh, look, um,
maybe he's just trying to be--

41:41.586 --> 41:43.283
Fucking unbelievable.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.546
Oh, Richard.

41:49.724 --> 41:51.421
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

41:53.032 --> 41:55.600
I have cancer,
I'm supposed to wear sunglasses

41:55.643 --> 41:57.297
in unusual places.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.341
Yeah.

42:02.607 --> 42:05.174
Excuse me,
can we have two more please?

42:06.611 --> 42:08.874
Uh, no, uh, the check please.

42:11.006 --> 42:12.181
Why?

42:12.225 --> 42:15.837
Look, you're coming with me.

42:15.881 --> 42:17.360
I don't wanna go with you.

42:18.492 --> 42:19.928
Peter,
where are we going?

42:19.972 --> 42:21.669
I'm taking you
to support group.

42:21.713 --> 42:23.497
A support group
for what?

42:23.541 --> 42:24.672
-Cancer.
-Oh, Jesus.

42:26.152 --> 42:27.370
Want me to help you
with your sabbatical,

42:27.414 --> 42:28.763
then do this for me.
This is not easy for me,

42:28.807 --> 42:30.199
it's actually, it's quite hard.

42:30.243 --> 42:33.420
Uh, I understand that, but,
you know, it's my death.

42:33.725 --> 42:34.856
Yeah.

42:35.944 --> 42:37.119
What the fuck is this?

42:37.163 --> 42:38.991
Well, it's, uh, it's Barbara's.

42:39.295 --> 42:41.776
Eww. Um, I'm not getting in.

42:41.820 --> 42:44.126
Shut up,
and get in the damn car.

42:45.650 --> 42:46.999
It actually drives quite nice.

42:47.695 --> 42:48.696
Door.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.220
- Here you go.
-Well done.

42:55.790 --> 43:00.403
After 20 years of marriage,
I thought she'd, you know,

43:00.882 --> 43:03.058
stick around until I died.

43:04.538 --> 43:06.932
At least, I hoped she would.

43:08.455 --> 43:11.197
But, I guess,
it was really no point,

43:11.545 --> 43:14.592
you know, I guess it makes
more sense for her

43:14.635 --> 43:16.245
to move on now.

43:19.031 --> 43:21.424
But despite all that, I'm-I'm...

43:22.425 --> 43:23.949
I'm feeling pretty good.

43:24.253 --> 43:26.821
I'm doing okay.

43:27.082 --> 43:28.083
Uh-hmm.

43:28.823 --> 43:29.824
Thank you.

43:31.304 --> 43:33.393
Thank you for sharing
the journey of your battle, Ed.

43:33.436 --> 43:34.699
Uh-hmm.

43:35.264 --> 43:37.484
All right.
Whenever you're ready.

43:40.269 --> 43:43.229
Uh, my name is Peter,
I'm healthy,

43:44.143 --> 43:45.623
I don't have cancer,

43:47.102 --> 43:48.800
at least I don't think I do.

43:48.843 --> 43:49.888
Um...

43:51.019 --> 43:52.194
my friend,

43:53.152 --> 43:54.501
Richard does.

43:54.544 --> 43:57.243
And I thought that he could here
and talk about it.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.639
I'm...

44:03.336 --> 44:04.293
scared,

44:05.643 --> 44:06.774
I'm worried,

44:08.123 --> 44:11.300
I don't wanna lose
my best friend.

44:11.561 --> 44:12.737
Oh.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.869
That is really very lovely
of you, Peter.

44:15.391 --> 44:18.307
Thank you for sharing
the journey of your...

44:20.135 --> 44:21.310
battle.

44:22.485 --> 44:23.835
All right, Richard.

44:23.878 --> 44:25.924
-Whenever you're ready.

44:26.576 --> 44:29.405
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not doing this. No, no.

44:30.232 --> 44:31.973
-Come on.
-I have nothing to say.

44:32.321 --> 44:34.106
- It's good for you.
-Uh, well, um,

44:34.149 --> 44:35.716
why don't you start
with your diagnosis?

44:35.760 --> 44:38.676
-Uh-hmm.
- Uh, I'd rather not,

44:38.980 --> 44:41.287
I'd actually prefer
to leave this place

44:41.330 --> 44:43.115
because the lighting
is poor down here,

44:43.158 --> 44:45.552
and it smells like urinal cakes
and sugar cookies.

44:45.595 --> 44:47.075
Uh, well, you find that if you--

44:47.119 --> 44:48.511
if you start
with your diagnosis--

44:48.555 --> 44:50.426
I think that you're gonna find
that I already know

44:50.470 --> 44:53.125
that I disagree with whatever
you're about to say.

44:53.516 --> 44:56.171
Peter, let's go.
We'll give it another shot.

44:57.433 --> 45:01.176
Would anyone else like to go
and grab a drink,

45:01.220 --> 45:03.701
and escape
this emotional circle jerk?

45:04.876 --> 45:06.094
What about you?

45:06.138 --> 45:07.705
You might need a drink or two.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.491
Richard, I--I've got cancer.

45:11.926 --> 45:13.188
So do I.

45:13.623 --> 45:16.539
Well, best of luck
with your impending deaths.

45:16.583 --> 45:18.759
-Yeah, you, too.
-Thank you.

45:20.152 --> 45:23.372
Oh, Richard, you gotta stay.
Uh, I wanna help you.

45:23.416 --> 45:24.939
Peter, no.

45:25.940 --> 45:27.768
I'd die here, and my corpse

45:27.812 --> 45:30.510
is nothing more than
a breeding ground for ticks.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.121
Plus, this way,

45:33.600 --> 45:35.994
I get to collect my salary
until the bitter end.

45:36.037 --> 45:37.299
Uh-huh.

45:38.039 --> 45:39.998
Maybe even after,
depending on

45:40.041 --> 45:44.219
how quickly it takes me
to find, my, uh, body.

45:46.004 --> 45:47.005
Oh.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.361
I have to leave for, uh...

45:56.623 --> 45:58.016
for Olivia's sake.

45:58.059 --> 45:59.104
No.

45:59.147 --> 46:01.106
Oh, no, no, come on. Listen.

46:01.149 --> 46:03.499
-Uh, yeah.
-All right. I'm gonna...

46:03.848 --> 46:06.067
-I am so sorry.
-I know.

46:12.247 --> 46:13.422
My friend.

46:15.903 --> 46:18.123
Oh, Richard.

46:19.167 --> 46:21.039
-Listen to me.
-Yeah.

46:21.082 --> 46:23.693
I think it's time to go
up to Canada.

46:23.737 --> 46:25.478
-No. I don't--
-Yeah.

46:28.916 --> 46:31.527
Peter, you know
they're talking about us.

46:35.444 --> 46:38.273
Hi. Hello, Professor Brown.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.841
-Hey, Claire.
-What are you doing here?

46:40.885 --> 46:42.582
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

46:42.625 --> 46:43.888
This is-- Claire, uh...

46:43.931 --> 46:45.237
This is Claire
and this is Peter.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.412
- Hi.
-Nice to see you.

46:46.455 --> 46:49.197
She's, in fact,
a niece of Henry Wright.

46:49.241 --> 46:51.156
Henry, Henry? Oh, how wonderful.

46:51.199 --> 46:52.897
That's great, good to meet you.

46:52.940 --> 46:55.421
You don't have to say that shit
because she despises him

46:55.464 --> 46:57.727
-as much as we do.
-Don't say things like that.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.078
He's all right, Henry Wright.

47:00.121 --> 47:02.558
He's perfectly right.

47:03.255 --> 47:04.865
I'll have another three please.

47:04.909 --> 47:07.041
-No, I don't want go.
-No, no, you're--

47:07.085 --> 47:09.174
-I'm having fun.
-You're behaving like a troll.

47:09.217 --> 47:10.436
We gotta go.

47:12.612 --> 47:14.614
Has anyone ever told you
that you're beautiful?

47:15.006 --> 47:16.137
Thank you, Peter.

47:16.659 --> 47:17.704
Good boy.

47:19.097 --> 47:21.795
Okay. That's it. Okay.
Get in the car. Just get--

47:21.839 --> 47:22.840
Ow.

47:23.188 --> 47:25.103
Hey, can I, uh,
buy you a nightcap?

47:25.843 --> 47:26.931
Nightcap?

47:27.322 --> 47:29.585
Hmm.
Barbara's gonna kill me.

47:30.021 --> 47:31.936
Would you be
disappointed if I said no?

47:31.979 --> 47:33.154
Was it a Mini Cooper?

47:33.198 --> 47:34.329
Yes.

47:35.330 --> 47:37.158
-Goodnight, Peter.
-Night.

47:37.202 --> 47:38.812
-Richard?
- Yeah.

47:39.030 --> 47:40.031
Love you.

47:41.467 --> 47:43.948
I'd like to say
how much I admire your bravery.

47:45.036 --> 47:46.602
Bravery for what?

47:49.605 --> 47:51.216
For being who you are,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.872
and doing so, unflinchingly.

47:55.263 --> 47:57.875
That's not bravery,
that's apathy.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.053
No, it's not.

54:03.849 --> 54:06.721
We had a deal for Olivia.

54:08.723 --> 54:09.811
I know.

54:11.552 --> 54:12.597
I'm sorry.

54:19.908 --> 54:21.083
Are you okay?

54:23.347 --> 54:24.826
Yeah. It's just my back.

54:41.887 --> 54:42.931
Richard?

54:43.932 --> 54:44.933
Yes?

54:46.457 --> 54:48.110
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you answer.

54:48.154 --> 54:50.678
Uh, it's Carol,
Henry's secretary.

54:51.505 --> 54:54.987
Uh, Richard, Henry would like
to have a word with you.

54:55.379 --> 54:57.598
-When?
- Now.

54:58.382 --> 54:59.644
Tell him I'm busy.

55:01.167 --> 55:02.429
He says the matter
is rather urgent.

55:02.821 --> 55:04.388
Tell him I'm urgently busy.

55:05.389 --> 55:06.390
Richard.

55:07.913 --> 55:09.044
Yes?

55:11.438 --> 55:13.266
He's ready
to see you now.

55:34.766 --> 55:36.507
Tell me, Richard,
do you like fish?

55:36.550 --> 55:39.248
No. I mean to eat sometimes,

55:39.292 --> 55:41.338
but outside of that, no.
No, I don't.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.602
I believe men could learn
a lot from fish.

55:44.645 --> 55:46.778
That's the most asinine thing
I've ever heard.

55:46.821 --> 55:48.693
Why don't we just cut
to the chase?

55:50.477 --> 55:51.609
All right.

55:52.523 --> 55:55.090
We need to talk
about certain allegations

55:55.134 --> 55:57.136
that have come to my attention,

55:57.179 --> 55:58.877
some of which are serious.

56:00.226 --> 56:01.662
Don't even start.

56:02.184 --> 56:03.229
Excuse me?

56:03.490 --> 56:05.187
I know you heard what I said.

56:05.231 --> 56:06.624
You're simply saying that
for effect.

56:06.667 --> 56:08.887
You want me to repeat myself,
I won't.

56:09.714 --> 56:11.846
I am chancellor
of this university.

56:11.890 --> 56:14.371
I couldn't give
a fucking rat's balls

56:14.849 --> 56:17.852
who the fuck you are.
I have tenure,

56:18.418 --> 56:19.376
and furthermore,

56:21.029 --> 56:22.814
you're in no position of power
when it comes to the two of us.

56:23.815 --> 56:25.556
You're cheating on your wife,
Henry.

56:25.599 --> 56:29.168
You're having an affair,
and not just any affair,

56:29.211 --> 56:32.650
but one with a wife
of a devoted faculty member,

56:33.520 --> 56:34.695
specifically

56:35.740 --> 56:36.828
mine.

56:37.437 --> 56:41.049
Not only that.
But you've allocated funds

56:41.093 --> 56:44.401
from a dwindling budget
for granite erections

56:44.444 --> 56:47.534
that you just littered
throughout this entire campus.

56:48.317 --> 56:51.799
And oddly enough,
they come from the woman

56:51.843 --> 56:53.714
that you're bird dogging
on the side.

56:54.759 --> 56:56.064
Can you remind me

56:56.108 --> 56:58.893
how much does one
of Veronica's works go for?

57:00.721 --> 57:04.856
Chancellor, I have mounted you
like a running stag,

57:04.899 --> 57:07.293
and I am pumping away at you,

57:07.554 --> 57:09.251
like a savage,

57:09.730 --> 57:12.167
and you know it.

57:14.605 --> 57:15.736
Now,

57:17.129 --> 57:18.913
I'm gonna take it
that my request for sabbatical

57:18.957 --> 57:20.698
has been accepted.

57:56.124 --> 57:58.039
Don't look so enthusiastic.

57:58.605 --> 57:59.737
Why would I?

57:59.998 --> 58:02.479
Well, for one,
it's gonna be catered.

58:03.392 --> 58:06.613
All Barbara ever talks about
is how well traveled she is.

58:06.657 --> 58:08.136
Well, what else
would she talk about?

58:08.659 --> 58:09.703
Thank you, dear.

58:12.140 --> 58:14.926
The air in Ibiza,

58:16.884 --> 58:18.495
there's really nothing like it.

58:19.931 --> 58:21.889
I'm getting misty,
just thinking about it.

58:21.933 --> 58:23.804
Peter, put our agent in touch
with them, all right?

58:23.848 --> 58:26.764
Yes, of course, yes,
I'd be happy to.

58:27.939 --> 58:28.940
Richard?

58:30.115 --> 58:31.333
Richard, what's the matter?

58:31.595 --> 58:34.075
Uh, darling, let him be.

58:34.946 --> 58:37.688
Anyway,
as I was saying, Ibiza...

58:37.731 --> 58:38.776
Are you all right?

58:40.342 --> 58:41.213
- You won't regret it.
-I'm more than all right.

58:41.256 --> 58:42.388
-You can't.
-I'm perfect.

58:42.649 --> 58:44.651
I mean, unless you're mad.

58:45.043 --> 58:47.132
Am I right or what, Peter?

58:47.175 --> 58:49.221
Oh, you're right, darling,
you're right.

58:51.702 --> 58:53.312
Does anybody else
have bones in the fish?

58:53.355 --> 58:54.792
We have something
to celebrate.

58:54.835 --> 58:57.316
What's that?
You got cancer, too?

58:57.359 --> 58:59.623
No. I do not.
Why do you keep saying that?

58:59.666 --> 59:00.711
Uh, my--

59:00.754 --> 59:03.061
Uh, I... my cyst is rather sore.

59:03.104 --> 59:04.453
Uh-oh, something in your throat?

59:04.497 --> 59:05.846
I think I should
get it screened.

59:05.890 --> 59:06.934
-Maybe.
-Yeah. Yeah.

59:07.152 --> 59:08.849
- Morocco.
-Yeah.

59:09.197 --> 59:12.157
Uh, Richard, uh,
no, no, no,

59:12.200 --> 59:13.898
that'll only encourage her.

59:13.941 --> 59:15.900
...we've noticed
that it's allowed us

59:15.943 --> 59:19.120
every time we've been
to discover something new

59:19.164 --> 59:20.469
about ourselves.

59:22.384 --> 59:25.910
You, my friend, have been
awarded a sabbatical.

59:26.650 --> 59:27.564
Thank you.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.392
Henry Wright signed
the paperwork, only last week.

59:30.436 --> 59:32.525
- Excuse me.
- See, I told you.

59:32.960 --> 59:34.396
What are you two doing?

59:35.049 --> 59:36.703
Uh we're discussing work.
That's all.

59:36.747 --> 59:39.184
Peter, it's my birthday,

59:40.228 --> 59:42.709
save it for another time,
and come mingle.

59:43.231 --> 59:45.843
-All right.
-And don't close these doors.

59:46.104 --> 59:47.366
No, darling.

59:49.020 --> 59:51.065
Anyway,
Peter was petrified--

59:51.109 --> 59:53.198
Why the hell
did we ever get married?

1:00:04.688 --> 1:00:05.645
You okay?

1:00:07.081 --> 1:00:09.736
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, babe.

1:00:15.263 --> 1:00:16.482
Are you sure?

1:00:17.788 --> 1:00:18.789
Yeah.

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:24.621
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:27.667
The person
one loves at first

1:00:27.711 --> 1:00:29.626
is not the person
one loves at last.

1:00:30.278 --> 1:00:31.628
Love is not an end,

1:00:32.411 --> 1:00:34.500
it's a process through,
which one person attempts

1:00:34.543 --> 1:00:35.632
to know another.

1:00:38.373 --> 1:00:39.374
That's it.

1:00:39.810 --> 1:00:41.899
And in a word?

1:00:42.334 --> 1:00:45.816
In two words,
deceptively simple.

1:00:45.859 --> 1:00:48.427
Beautifully,
beautifully executed.

1:00:48.470 --> 1:00:54.389
And it's a really nice way to
end the class with a little,

1:00:56.130 --> 1:00:57.305
kick in the ass.

1:00:58.045 --> 1:00:59.481
So, you get an A.

1:00:59.830 --> 1:01:01.788
-Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:01:02.441 --> 1:01:04.573
And I suppose the rest of you
are waiting

1:01:04.835 --> 1:01:09.187
for me to vomit out
some profound words of wisdom.

1:01:09.230 --> 1:01:10.492
Yeah, kind of.

1:01:10.536 --> 1:01:13.060
Oh, thought you'd never ask.

1:01:15.149 --> 1:01:16.847
Come here, give me a hand.

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:18.718
Thanks.

1:01:18.762 --> 1:01:20.677
-Hey, hey, okay.

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:22.679
Listen...

1:01:23.462 --> 1:01:26.770
the world needs people
like you.

1:01:28.032 --> 1:01:31.905
The world is literally dying
for your kind.

1:01:33.602 --> 1:01:36.649
Embrace that responsibility,
and you run with it.

1:01:38.129 --> 1:01:40.958
Get out there, earn your keep.
Give back.

1:01:41.828 --> 1:01:44.918
It's not gonna be easy.
Never gonna be easy.

1:01:44.962 --> 1:01:46.528
For much of it,
you'll stand alone

1:01:46.572 --> 1:01:49.357
but you've got to stand strong.

1:01:50.358 --> 1:01:51.751
You know, I beg you

1:01:52.621 --> 1:01:55.363
to not give into mediocrity,

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:58.062
like the other 98 percent
of the world.

1:01:59.019 --> 1:02:02.022
Because you would be doing
yourselves,

1:02:02.631 --> 1:02:05.634
and the world,
a greatest disservice.

1:02:06.418 --> 1:02:07.941
You're all too smart.

1:02:08.768 --> 1:02:10.814
You're too smart
to let it go to waste.

1:02:11.553 --> 1:02:14.992
And you've got one shot at this.

1:02:15.035 --> 1:02:16.428
One fucking shot.

1:02:18.038 --> 1:02:19.997
Don't let a moment of it
slip by.

1:02:21.433 --> 1:02:23.914
Grab it, snatch it up,
make it yours.

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.004
Celebrate every moment.

1:02:27.831 --> 1:02:29.789
Celebrate every fucking breath.

1:02:33.532 --> 1:02:35.099
I'm telling you, life,

1:02:35.577 --> 1:02:36.927
it's a birdsong.

1:02:46.284 --> 1:02:47.764
Was that it?

1:02:49.374 --> 1:02:52.246
Yeah, I think--I think so, yeah.

1:02:53.291 --> 1:02:54.683
Yeah, that's it.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:24.496
Richard? Richard.

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:27.629
Oh, oh, Richard.

1:03:27.673 --> 1:03:29.806
Oh, no, no, no.
Richard, are you all right?

1:03:30.502 --> 1:03:31.503
Christ.

1:03:32.547 --> 1:03:34.114
-Angels.
-What?

1:03:34.158 --> 1:03:37.422
I hear the angels, Peter,
they're singing.

1:03:37.683 --> 1:03:40.338
No, that's the--that's
the acapella group, Richard.

1:03:41.165 --> 1:03:42.166
Here.

1:03:43.341 --> 1:03:45.604
Why? Why do we have
an acapella group?

1:03:46.126 --> 1:03:48.128
We've always had
an acapella group.

1:03:49.826 --> 1:03:52.741
Well, fuck them.
Can you take me to the bells?

1:03:52.785 --> 1:03:54.874
-What?
-I wanna see the bells.

1:03:55.179 --> 1:03:56.702
-The bells?
-Yeah.

1:03:57.355 --> 1:04:00.358
All right. All right. Come.

1:04:00.401 --> 1:04:02.447
I'll get you
some water first.

1:04:28.865 --> 1:04:29.953
Peter,

1:04:31.389 --> 1:04:35.393
there are a lot of other
good places to sit in here.

1:04:36.133 --> 1:04:37.525
Hmm, yes.

1:04:38.352 --> 1:04:39.484
Of course.

1:04:40.137 --> 1:04:41.138
Yeah.

1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:03.900
Can you feel anything?

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:06.903
No.

1:05:08.687 --> 1:05:09.993
But I enjoy the lighting.

1:05:11.124 --> 1:05:13.213
-You?
-No.

1:05:14.649 --> 1:05:15.955
But that's all right.

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:23.267
Please mother of God,
help my friend...

1:05:23.745 --> 1:05:25.312
Afraid it's starting to kick in.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:29.012
Does it hurt?

1:05:30.535 --> 1:05:31.753
Oh, fuck yeah.

1:05:32.276 --> 1:05:33.538
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:05:34.408 --> 1:05:35.583
I'll manage.

1:05:39.283 --> 1:05:41.763
It's fine, Peter.
We knew this was coming.

1:05:43.330 --> 1:05:44.331
Yeah.

1:05:46.725 --> 1:05:48.292
I mean, uh,
I look back on everything,

1:05:48.335 --> 1:05:50.772
and it all somehow
makes so much sense.

1:05:51.077 --> 1:05:54.863
It's as though, uh,
it couldn't be any other way.

1:06:01.348 --> 1:06:03.350
Why's our soul broken?

1:06:04.656 --> 1:06:06.179
Absurd.

1:06:07.615 --> 1:06:08.790
Yet...

1:06:10.053 --> 1:06:11.315
It's perfect.

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:16.494
And it's also perfect
when you look at it.

1:06:16.537 --> 1:06:18.409
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

1:06:32.771 --> 1:06:34.686
It's gonna be hard
to leave this place.

1:06:39.430 --> 1:06:41.475
It's gonna be hard
to say goodbye.

1:06:42.955 --> 1:06:45.697
Richard, I'm gonna miss you.

1:06:47.438 --> 1:06:50.049
I'm gonna miss you too, Peter.
If I'm able.

1:06:52.660 --> 1:06:54.880
Fuck, I'm going to cry.

1:06:54.923 --> 1:06:56.360
-No.
-Dear God.

1:06:56.621 --> 1:06:58.188
-Please.

1:06:58.231 --> 1:06:59.841
Please don't do this.
No, no, shh.

1:06:59.885 --> 1:07:01.930
-Dammit.
-No, no, no. Listen.

1:07:02.322 --> 1:07:04.194
I really prefer
if you didn't cry.

1:07:04.237 --> 1:07:06.892
-Listen to me. We tried.

1:07:06.935 --> 1:07:10.287
-Yes. Yes.
-Now let's go. Come on.

1:07:10.765 --> 1:07:12.419
-Come on.

1:07:12.463 --> 1:07:13.464
Okay.

1:07:14.247 --> 1:07:15.814
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

1:07:15.857 --> 1:07:17.120
It's all right.

1:07:18.512 --> 1:07:19.644
Come on, Peter.

1:07:22.255 --> 1:07:23.300
-Oh.

1:07:30.263 --> 1:07:32.048
You're a good man, Richard.

1:07:32.874 --> 1:07:34.354
So are you, my friend.

1:07:35.877 --> 1:07:37.662
Thank you for being
so good to me.

1:07:37.705 --> 1:07:41.057
I'm trying, Richard.
I'm trying.

1:07:43.798 --> 1:07:46.192
Isn't it strange
how natural this feels?

1:07:46.236 --> 1:07:48.151
- Yeah.
- Two men,

1:07:48.194 --> 1:07:51.023
holding one another,
passionately, in a church.

1:07:51.632 --> 1:07:54.070
Groping one another freely.

1:07:57.203 --> 1:07:58.248
Yeah.

1:07:59.684 --> 1:08:00.467
-Oh, you're stupid.
- Come on you, pervert.

1:08:23.925 --> 1:08:24.926
Hey.

1:08:26.624 --> 1:08:27.625
Bye.

1:08:30.236 --> 1:08:31.672
You're going out tonight?

1:08:31.716 --> 1:08:32.717
Yeah.

1:08:33.761 --> 1:08:34.762
Okay.

1:08:35.763 --> 1:08:37.243
You have fun, okay?

1:08:38.940 --> 1:08:40.333
Yeah, you, too.

1:08:41.943 --> 1:08:45.512
I'm not sure that's possible,
but I'm promising you

1:08:45.556 --> 1:08:47.123
that we will try.

1:08:50.517 --> 1:08:51.823
Go get 'em, kid.

1:08:57.220 --> 1:08:58.177
Bye, dad.

1:09:12.452 --> 1:09:15.586
Thank you so much
for coming, really.

1:09:15.629 --> 1:09:18.502
Oh, oh, you get just lovelier
every year.

1:09:19.416 --> 1:09:22.288
Veronica, Richard.
Our guest of honor.

1:09:22.897 --> 1:09:24.116
So nice you could make it.

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:25.770
Oh, we wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1:09:25.813 --> 1:09:27.119
How do you do?
Hi, I'm Richard.

1:09:28.207 --> 1:09:30.078
Oh, okay.

1:09:30.122 --> 1:09:31.819
That's a hell of a greeting.

1:09:34.474 --> 1:09:36.650
I'm going to the bar.

1:09:39.827 --> 1:09:40.828
Hi.

1:09:41.307 --> 1:09:42.308
Hi.

1:09:43.614 --> 1:09:44.876
Peter and I have decided
to stay in this year,

1:09:44.919 --> 1:09:46.965
and spend Christmas in Miami.

1:09:47.008 --> 1:09:49.707
- Hello.
-Oh, how fashionable.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:52.536
Donna, you weren't
at my birthday party. Why?

1:09:54.886 --> 1:09:57.105
I've been so wanting to tell you

1:09:57.149 --> 1:09:59.282
-that I mixed up the date.
-Oh.

1:09:59.325 --> 1:10:01.632
Excuse me everyone,
if I could have your attention.

1:10:01.675 --> 1:10:04.722
Dinner is to be served shortly,
so, if you would be so kind

1:10:04.765 --> 1:10:06.680
as to begin migrating
to the dining room,

1:10:06.724 --> 1:10:08.378
that would be much appreciated.

1:10:13.034 --> 1:10:15.472
Veronica.
You'll be right here next to me.

1:10:15.515 --> 1:10:17.125
-Richard.

1:10:17.169 --> 1:10:18.997
Uh, no, no, no.
Tight Quarters, I'm afraid.

1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:20.346
He'll be somewhere in the back.

1:10:26.570 --> 1:10:27.919
Hello, everyone.

1:10:28.572 --> 1:10:32.489
Um, sorry, why isn't Richard
sitting at this table?

1:10:32.532 --> 1:10:34.099
I can assure you
that there has been

1:10:34.142 --> 1:10:35.448
a great deal of thought

1:10:35.492 --> 1:10:37.537
that's going
into the seating arrangements.

1:10:43.021 --> 1:10:44.022
What?

1:10:44.283 --> 1:10:45.676
Dead, gone.

1:10:45.719 --> 1:10:48.505
Oh, that's horrible.
What was it?

1:10:48.853 --> 1:10:51.159
Oh, melanoma, I'm afraid.

1:10:51.203 --> 1:10:54.554
Oh. Oh, welcome,
young man.

1:10:55.947 --> 1:10:57.340
And the families?

1:10:57.383 --> 1:10:58.645
Honestly,

1:10:58.906 --> 1:11:00.952
-you don't wanna know.
-Oh, really?

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:06.349
While everyone's being served,

1:11:06.392 --> 1:11:08.568
I just wanted to say
a couple words.

1:11:08.873 --> 1:11:13.051
On behalf of both myself
and my lovely wife, welcome.

1:11:13.094 --> 1:11:14.487
It's an honor to have each

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:16.446
and every one of you
here tonight.

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:20.101
Now, I know I'm not alone
when I say that this quarter

1:11:20.363 --> 1:11:22.452
may have been our very best.

1:11:22.930 --> 1:11:25.193
And the opportunity to serve,

1:11:25.237 --> 1:11:27.413
as your president
and chancellor,

1:11:27.674 --> 1:11:31.287
has been nothing short
of humbling.

1:11:33.201 --> 1:11:34.551
So thank you.

1:11:34.594 --> 1:11:36.292
I can only hope

1:11:36.596 --> 1:11:39.512
to live up to the high standards
that you have set.

1:11:39.556 --> 1:11:41.253
- We will.
- Cheers.

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:45.083
Now, let us eat
for the night is young.

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:50.915
Oh, that was a lovely speech.

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:52.046
Beautiful.

1:11:52.090 --> 1:11:53.526
Did you actually
buy that shit, really?

1:11:54.397 --> 1:11:55.398
Excuse me?

1:11:56.616 --> 1:11:58.923
Are you in the
communications department?

1:12:27.995 --> 1:12:30.258
I have something
that I would like to say.

1:12:32.522 --> 1:12:34.045
Could you stop playing that

1:12:34.088 --> 1:12:36.308
before I heave this knife
in your direction?

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:37.831
- Thank you.

1:12:37.875 --> 1:12:39.616
Uh, young lady with the wine,
would you mind

1:12:39.659 --> 1:12:42.532
just standing right by my side,
and never leave?

1:12:43.010 --> 1:12:44.838
Because I have much to say

1:12:45.752 --> 1:12:47.972
-and many to toast.
-Oh, my God.

1:12:48.015 --> 1:12:51.192
Those of you who do not know,
my name is Richard Brown.

1:12:52.193 --> 1:12:53.412
Professor of English.

1:12:53.847 --> 1:12:56.328
Oh, uh, cheers to me.

1:12:57.111 --> 1:12:58.374
Cheers.

1:12:58.417 --> 1:13:00.027
-Cheers.
- To Richard.

1:13:01.028 --> 1:13:05.381
Henry Wright, on behalf
of every one of us here,

1:13:05.424 --> 1:13:08.732
let me, please, express
our gratitude,

1:13:09.863 --> 1:13:12.910
-for this finely forced evening.
-I'm sorry.

1:13:12.953 --> 1:13:14.868
The commitment
that you have shown

1:13:14.912 --> 1:13:19.438
to the students, faculty,
even the wives of the faculty...

1:13:21.353 --> 1:13:22.963
...is very, very impressive.

1:13:23.355 --> 1:13:24.791
You've outdone yourself.

1:13:26.358 --> 1:13:27.403
And it shows.

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:32.146
As far as I'm concerned,
three balls...

1:13:32.973 --> 1:13:34.975
-deserves three cheers.
- No.

1:13:35.759 --> 1:13:37.543
All right, Richard,
I think that's enough.

1:13:37.587 --> 1:13:40.981
Henry, do not
interrupt me while I'm talking.

1:13:41.025 --> 1:13:43.027
Particularly in front
of so many people.

1:13:43.070 --> 1:13:45.029
-Do you understand?
-No, I don't understand.

1:13:45.072 --> 1:13:46.160
Yeah.

1:13:46.204 --> 1:13:47.510
Nobody has
three testicles.

1:13:47.553 --> 1:13:48.772
To Peter Matthew.

1:13:48.815 --> 1:13:50.077
-Oh.
- Oh.

1:13:50.121 --> 1:13:51.209
Gotta shut up.

1:13:52.384 --> 1:13:54.342
Your heart is truly
one of gold.

1:13:54.386 --> 1:13:56.867
- It is.
-And this college is...

1:13:57.171 --> 1:13:59.217
-very lucky to have you.
- Hmm, that's true.

1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:01.524
Of course, thank you
for your hard work.

1:14:01.567 --> 1:14:04.483
But most important, thank you

1:14:05.310 --> 1:14:06.572
for being a true friend.

1:14:06.616 --> 1:14:08.487
- Oh, to Peter, cheers.
- Cheers.

1:14:08.531 --> 1:14:09.749
To Peter.

1:14:09.793 --> 1:14:12.491
Also there are some
parting words

1:14:12.535 --> 1:14:14.885
that I feel like I owe.

1:14:15.625 --> 1:14:17.714
Because this will be
the last time

1:14:17.757 --> 1:14:19.846
that I ever see any of you.

1:14:21.413 --> 1:14:26.244
For not only have I been awarded
a sabbatical, um...

1:14:26.897 --> 1:14:28.725
This is strange,
Peter.

1:14:31.641 --> 1:14:33.338
...I'm gonna die.

1:14:34.731 --> 1:14:36.515
Yeah...

1:14:37.081 --> 1:14:39.126
-I'm gonna die,

1:14:39.170 --> 1:14:43.217
and I'm gonna die much sooner
than I had imagined.

1:14:45.568 --> 1:14:47.004
Oh, my goodness.

1:14:49.093 --> 1:14:50.355
I know, dear.

1:14:50.398 --> 1:14:53.053
-What is he talking about?
-Shh.

1:14:53.097 --> 1:14:55.621
So in preparing
for what lies ahead,

1:14:56.274 --> 1:14:59.495
I've come to realize
that for much of my life,

1:15:00.974 --> 1:15:02.454
I've been mistaken,

1:15:03.977 --> 1:15:05.936
and I failed.

1:15:05.979 --> 1:15:10.941
I failed, not only
to comprehend my mortality,

1:15:11.942 --> 1:15:13.596
but I've failed
to appreciate it.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.120
And as a result,

1:15:18.339 --> 1:15:21.604
I've failed to make
the most of my life.

1:15:23.606 --> 1:15:26.478
Veronica,
you're one hell of a sport.

1:15:26.522 --> 1:15:29.612
You are a very worthy adversary.

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:31.570
Proud...

1:15:32.919 --> 1:15:34.834
to have been able
to call you my wife.

1:15:36.096 --> 1:15:38.882
Because life without you
would've been, uh,

1:15:38.925 --> 1:15:40.144
far less rich.

1:15:40.492 --> 1:15:42.102
And for that, I thank you.

1:15:44.365 --> 1:15:45.802
For whatever it's worth...

1:15:52.025 --> 1:15:53.244
I love you...

1:15:54.027 --> 1:15:55.028
deeply.

1:15:55.681 --> 1:15:56.987
I know.

1:16:00.904 --> 1:16:05.038
We've turned our backs
on the most important duty

1:16:05.082 --> 1:16:06.605
that we possess,

1:16:07.258 --> 1:16:10.391
to live a life
that is rich in experience

1:16:13.090 --> 1:16:15.396
that's of our own
independent choosing.

1:16:16.615 --> 1:16:19.052
Seize your fucking existence,
folks.

1:16:19.357 --> 1:16:22.360
Why don't we make death
our closest fucking companion,

1:16:22.708 --> 1:16:26.669
so that we can finally
have a second,

1:16:26.712 --> 1:16:28.975
a millisecond to appreciate

1:16:29.672 --> 1:16:31.674
that little bit of time
that we have left.

1:16:32.152 --> 1:16:34.154
And most important of all,

1:16:34.633 --> 1:16:36.026
let us live well,

1:16:37.157 --> 1:16:39.072
so that
we may fucking die well,

1:16:40.030 --> 1:16:42.685
because we've never been
so close to death

1:16:43.337 --> 1:16:44.861
than this very moment.

1:16:45.470 --> 1:16:46.689
Cheers.

1:16:56.873 --> 1:16:58.788
Dammit, Richard.
Those are crystal.

1:17:20.723 --> 1:17:21.898
I'm so sorry

1:17:21.941 --> 1:17:23.856
that you had
to find out like that,

1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:25.379
and I just didn't--

1:17:26.163 --> 1:17:28.034
I mean, I honestly didn't know
how to tell you.

1:17:28.078 --> 1:17:29.340
I was scared.

1:17:32.430 --> 1:17:33.910
What are you gonna do?

1:17:35.563 --> 1:17:37.348
I'm gonna leave, sweetheart.

1:17:38.610 --> 1:17:40.438
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:52.015
Please, try and find
some happiness.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:54.887
I'm working on it.

1:17:55.758 --> 1:17:56.889
I know you will.

1:18:01.546 --> 1:18:03.156
Goodbye, Richard.

1:18:25.309 --> 1:18:26.658
Goodbye, Veronica.

1:18:29.139 --> 1:18:30.270
Bye.

1:19:07.525 --> 1:19:11.355
Olivia?
What are you doing home, baby?

1:19:12.399 --> 1:19:13.836
Taylor broke up with me.

1:19:15.011 --> 1:19:16.969
-What?
-She cheated on me

1:19:17.013 --> 1:19:18.710
with Nathan Runnings.

1:19:20.581 --> 1:19:22.192
Professor Runnings' kid?

1:19:24.368 --> 1:19:25.412
Mm-hmm.

1:19:28.894 --> 1:19:30.809
Listen. Hey.

1:19:34.552 --> 1:19:36.206
Come on, babe. Come here.

1:19:36.510 --> 1:19:37.511
Come here.

1:19:40.340 --> 1:19:42.516
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna be fine.

1:19:43.822 --> 1:19:45.432
The world's full of women

1:19:46.259 --> 1:19:47.913
looking for someone to love.

1:19:48.174 --> 1:19:50.786
There's gotta be somebody
who deserves you.

1:19:53.266 --> 1:19:56.574
-What'll you have?
-I don't care.

1:19:57.662 --> 1:20:00.708
Well, when a man
loses a woman,

1:20:00.752 --> 1:20:03.537
it's, uh, typically whiskey
he drinks.

1:20:06.671 --> 1:20:07.715
So,

1:20:08.804 --> 1:20:11.415
I'm kind of
assuming that, um,

1:20:13.069 --> 1:20:14.897
a lesbian would do the same.

1:20:30.869 --> 1:20:32.262
Here's to your future.

1:20:33.350 --> 1:20:36.005
To your bright, bright future.

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:39.791
To Taylor rotting in hell.

1:20:40.052 --> 1:20:42.838
And yes,
to Taylor rotting in hell.

1:20:43.926 --> 1:20:45.057
Cheers.

1:20:57.809 --> 1:20:59.463
I'm so proud of you.

1:21:02.683 --> 1:21:03.684
Why?

1:21:07.645 --> 1:21:10.561
Because you possess
everything

1:21:10.953 --> 1:21:13.825
that a father could ever want

1:21:14.434 --> 1:21:16.436
in a daughter, and more.

1:21:17.307 --> 1:21:18.656
So much more.

1:21:27.839 --> 1:21:28.840
Dad.

1:21:30.842 --> 1:21:32.148
Yeah, baby?

1:21:36.848 --> 1:21:38.067
Are you okay?

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:48.164
I'm sick, Olivia.

1:21:49.861 --> 1:21:51.123
I'm sick.

1:21:56.868 --> 1:21:58.565
Are you gonna be okay?

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:07.139
No.

1:22:11.491 --> 1:22:12.710
It's all right.

1:22:13.363 --> 1:22:14.451
It's all right.

1:22:16.366 --> 1:22:19.238
You're gonna be all right.
Do you hear me?

1:22:20.718 --> 1:22:22.241
You're gonna be great.

1:22:26.245 --> 1:22:27.246
Um...

1:22:31.642 --> 1:22:33.992
I'm gonna need to go away
for a little bit.

1:22:35.994 --> 1:22:37.474
Where are you going?

1:22:38.692 --> 1:22:40.303
I don't really know.

1:22:43.610 --> 1:22:45.612
I just got some things
I gotta figure out.

1:22:52.968 --> 1:22:53.969
Um...

1:23:13.205 --> 1:23:16.513
Hey, I love you so much,
my girl.

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:19.603
I love you, too.

1:23:21.474 --> 1:23:23.694
You stay on this path of yours.

1:23:24.608 --> 1:23:25.739
You hear me?

1:23:26.088 --> 1:23:28.090
You stay on this path
that's yours.

1:23:30.309 --> 1:23:32.007
You're doing it right, kid.

1:23:43.540 --> 1:23:45.846
I'm gonna miss you so much.

Jibbles,

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:11.785

1:24:12.830 --> 1:24:14.005
Good boy.

1:24:21.752 --> 1:24:24.450
You make sure your mom
takes good care of you, huh?

1:24:27.149 --> 1:24:28.976
I can take care of myself.

1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:35.635
I have no doubt about that, kid.

1:26:37.148 --> 1:26:38.323
