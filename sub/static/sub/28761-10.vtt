WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:13.054
Mr. President.

00:13.138 --> 00:17.475
Doctor, thank you for coming.
Please. I see you did your civic duty.

00:17.559 --> 00:22.188
You can't ask, and it'd probably violate
some shrink canon of ethics to tell you,

00:22.272 --> 00:24.733
but I don't think
you'd be unhappy with my choice.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.987
Were you surprised to get my call?

00:29.487 --> 00:34.075
One's capacity for surprise tends to be
an early casualty in this line of work.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.620
But it did seem an unusual way
for a presidential candidate

00:37.704 --> 00:39.581
-to spend his election day.
-I don't know.

00:39.664 --> 00:43.126
In 1960, Richard Nixon voted
in Southern California,

00:43.209 --> 00:46.629
hopped into a white convertible,
ditched the press and headed south.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.923
Ended up in Tijuana, where he had lunch,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.593
then came back across the border,
meandered north,

00:51.676 --> 00:54.137
all the way up to the Mission
at San Juan Capistrano,

00:54.220 --> 00:57.432
entered the church,
sat down in one of the empty pews,

00:58.099 --> 01:01.603
reportedly for hours. So, at best,
this would have to rate second.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.898
Well, what did you want to talk about?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.943
I'm having difficulty sleeping.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.197
Anxious insomnia can't be unknown
to presidential candidates.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.407
-This is different.
-Why?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.538
I have a confession to make.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.583
[theme music playing]

01:32.258 --> 01:33.968
[Cornelius through laptop speakers]
<i>God damn it, Garrett!</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:36.346
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>have you and Phil done to me?</i>

01:36.429 --> 01:39.516
<i>Why would you do this despicable thing</i>
<i>behind my back?</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:41.601
<i>Why would you do it at all?</i>

01:42.811 --> 01:43.937
[cell phone vibrating]

01:46.397 --> 01:48.191
-Hey.
-Did you find anything out?

01:48.274 --> 01:51.986
That you need to call a lawyer. We all do.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.638
[sighs]

02:20.098 --> 02:21.558
What is so important?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.810
This establishes
attorney-client privilege.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.603
That's just a TV thing.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.650
We can either talk as old friends,
or with my $800-an-hour meter running.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.695
Seems to me like you might require
the latter.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.116
My boss on the campaign
bugged Cornelius Moss' phone.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.036
-How long have you known?
-Half an hour.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.454
-Who else have you told?
-No one.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.040
Good. Now take out your phone
and call the FBI.

02:48.084 --> 02:51.004
I'm guessing we've arrived
at the privileged part.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.965
You're afraid it'll hurt
Kirkman's chances.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.011
-Did he know about it?
-No.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.263
You know that or are you guessing?

03:00.805 --> 03:04.934
I don't... I don't know that,
but I'm not guessing. I know him.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.813
By delaying, you may or may not be
doing him a favor in the end.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.940
But I can guarantee
you're not helping yourself.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.235
Every hour you don't come forward,
you're gonna have to explain that

03:14.319 --> 03:18.656
to the FBI, federal prosecutor,
congressional committee.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.199
It's gonna get expensive.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.497
-Are you gonna be all right?
-Yeah.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.209
-Keep me posted.
-Sure. At eight bills an hour.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.254
-Well, you get the old flame discount.
-What? We were never--

03:33.338 --> 03:34.714
I didn't say it was requited.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.803
[Louden] I don't know what Nixon
was seeking in that chapel,

03:40.887 --> 03:41.846
but I'm not a priest.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.640
I don't offer absolution.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.768
Unless it's a different sort
of confession.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.438
Are you about to reveal
the commission of a crime?

03:51.898 --> 03:55.318
Not in a legal sense.
Arguably, a moral one.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.905
Still privileged nonetheless.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.199
Understood. Go on.

04:02.825 --> 04:03.826
[door opens]

04:04.869 --> 04:07.080
Thank you, Mike. Emily, please.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.583
[sighs]

04:11.876 --> 04:13.002
What's going on?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.630
[sighs] You need to hear this.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.007
[Cornelius through speakers]
<i>God damn it, Garrett!</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:20.093
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>have you and Phil done to me?</i>

04:20.718 --> 04:23.888
<i>Why would you do this despicable thing</i>
<i>behind my back?</i>

04:23.972 --> 04:25.556
<i>Why would you do it at all?</i>

04:29.560 --> 04:33.273
-Where the hell did you get this?
-On the advice of counsel, I can't say.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.277
-The White House Counsel?
-My personal attorney.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.280
There's something else.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.535
I was the one that leaked the information
about Moss carrying the Alzheimer's gene.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.412
Excuse me?

04:47.495 --> 04:51.040
I wrongly felt
that we needed to fight fire with fire,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.835
and I regretted it immediately,
but was too ashamed to tell you

04:53.918 --> 04:56.087
because I knew
you would be disappointed in me,

04:56.754 --> 04:58.881
which is why I had to play this for you
right away.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.801
I couldn't fail you again...

05:01.884 --> 05:03.261
[breathes deeply]

05:03.344 --> 05:07.640
...and given the high premium that you put
on personal integrity and fair play,

05:07.724 --> 05:12.520
I knew you'd want to correct the record,
consequences be damned.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.359
I should go.

05:23.865 --> 05:24.866
Emily.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.869
Thank you for this.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.663
Good night, sir.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.718
[Louden] Did you believe
the sound recording was authentic?

05:43.801 --> 05:46.554
-Seemingly.
-Isn't that equivocating?

05:46.637 --> 05:48.806
-I couldn't be certain.
-I didn't ask if you were certain.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.892
I asked if you believed if it was real.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.563
Yes. Yes, I did.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.734
[typing]

05:59.817 --> 06:01.527
[Mars] You made me late.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.530
[Lynn] You made yourself late.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.868
The quickie.
Another faculty lost to old age.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.037
-I'm not complaining.
-[chuckles]

06:11.120 --> 06:13.206
It appears your boy's gonna win.

06:13.289 --> 06:17.001
Didn't your father ever tell you
never to say that out loud?

06:17.085 --> 06:20.338
He was customarily reelected
by a 20-point margin.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.800
In our house, superstition was deemed
a counterfeit humility.

06:24.675 --> 06:28.721
You know, your dad's old Senate seat
is up for special election next year.

06:29.305 --> 06:33.476
It'd be nice to get somebody in there
to do justice to the old man's memory.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.522
Yeah, and be a reliable Senate vote
for Kirkman's next term agenda.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.482
It's not gonna be easy.

06:39.565 --> 06:44.529
A presidential win by a man with no party,
no coattails, favors owed.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.989
Means to whip rank-and-file discipline.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.617
-You'll just have to scare them.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.412
Speaking of scary,

06:53.496 --> 06:57.208
we got the bill for my rehab,
and I can't help but feel awful about it.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.293
-Babe, you--
-Not to mention guilty

06:59.377 --> 07:01.796
over how lucky we are
that we have the means.

07:01.879 --> 07:07.218
The main thing is that you're sober now
and committed to staying that way.

07:11.430 --> 07:16.936
-Thank you again for being so supportive.
-It is so great to have you back.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.025
Dawn patrol!

07:23.693 --> 07:26.529
Huddle up. Here we are.

07:26.612 --> 07:31.492
Day before the election.
Overnight polling is encouraging.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.286
-[Bryce] Encouraging? We're killing it!
-[crowd laughs]

07:33.369 --> 07:35.163
[Lorraine] Don't get overconfident.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.998
We're still within the margin of error
in the battlegrounds,

07:37.081 --> 07:39.542
in Florida, in the Upper Midwest,
in Texas.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.793
Did you just hear yourself?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.545
The words "Texas" and "battlegrounds"
in the same sentence?

07:42.628 --> 07:43.463
Right.

07:43.546 --> 07:47.300
It's a wonder what a little genocidal
plotting by your opponent will do.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.595
But let's not count chickens.
You think you're tired now?

07:50.678 --> 07:52.555
I want you next-level spent.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.432
We gotta canvass, canvass, canvass.

07:54.515 --> 07:58.561
Work the phones, tweet storms,
get out there and knock on doors.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.938
I want you so far up
your state chairs' asses

08:01.022 --> 08:03.566
that when they yawn, I see your hairline.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.735
-[crowd chuckles]
-[Lorraine] Go win an election.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.070
-[crowd cheers]
-Good luck.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.657
Emily, hang back a minute?

08:14.911 --> 08:18.831
I heard about your mom. I'm so sorry.
That must have been...

08:18.915 --> 08:21.459
Oh, God, I can't imagine
what that was like.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.962
If you need, just take the day.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.298
Thank you, but I'm fine.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.779
-Have you contacted an attorney?
-You found Pegasus.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.489
We can't have this conversation.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.325
-Fuck!
-You're with the president today.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.369
Call me after.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.623
-After what?
-You'll know.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.552
Just because I believed the recording
was real, didn't answer everything.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.639
What if I was wrong? What if it had been
staged and strategically released?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.432
Is that what you suspected?

09:18.516 --> 09:21.811
It was possible, given what was at stake,
the dirty tricks Moss had already played.

09:22.812 --> 09:27.692
But it wasn't leaked to the media.
It came via your own campaign aide.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.069
-So, your dirty trick scenario--
-Is bullshit.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.322
Congratulations, you got me. Happy?

09:34.156 --> 09:37.910
Are you happy?
You're about to be elected president.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.122
Do I look happy?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.254
[Isabel] Just a second.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.840
[sniffles] Come in.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.468
Hey, you left this on the bathroom sink.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.388
Looking promising for tomorrow.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.265
Yep.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.980
-You doing okay?
-[voice breaks] No.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.442
-Aaron?
-[sniffles] He was...

10:09.525 --> 10:13.112
He was so sweet with my parents, and...

10:14.488 --> 10:17.867
he's come such a long way
in embracing who he is.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.537
And now, he's about to become
vice president.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.957
And I still have so much anger.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.211
Maybe you just need a little revenge sex.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.757
[laughing]

10:35.801 --> 10:38.846
-It's not that funny.
-[sobbing] I'm sorry.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.642
This whole thing
just has me really emotional.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.813
Fine. More emotional.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.315
The good news is,

10:49.398 --> 10:51.525
it's not something you need
to figure out right now, right?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.152
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Sorry.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.196
Thank you.

10:56.864 --> 10:57.948
[sniffling]

11:02.078 --> 11:03.412
[scoffs]

11:09.502 --> 11:11.921
[Louden] Why does talking about this
make you angry?

11:12.004 --> 11:14.799
-I was wrestling with something else.
-What?

11:14.882 --> 11:18.469
I'm trying to figure a way to say this
without it sounding like an excuse.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.304
I'm not sitting here in judgment.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.060
How much does this recording
exonerate Moss anyway?

11:26.143 --> 11:27.645
Unpack that.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.107
Moss is in league with the conspirators
in a larger sense.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.819
Accepted huge amounts of money from one,
paid a lavish salary to the other.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.904
These men's views were widely known.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.656
Detwiler was quoted as saying

11:38.739 --> 11:41.909
immigrants were turning America
into a third world country.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.245
Brunton tweeted out,
"We can't save our civilization

11:44.328 --> 11:45.996
on the backs of other people's babies."

11:46.080 --> 11:48.666
Moss knew exactly who he was
getting into bed with.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.711
And if he wins this election,
they're who he'll be accountable to.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.841
In articulating that,
did that sound to you like an excuse?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.720
No, it sounded like the truth.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.099
[cell phone ringing]

12:05.182 --> 12:08.352
-Hey, how's it going?
-You people are sadists.

12:08.436 --> 12:12.273
Rallies in San Antonio, Austin and Dallas?
It's barely 9:00.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.941
[chuckles softly]
That's a lot of breakfast burritos.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.153
[sighs] Hey, Em, I'm sorry about your mom.

12:17.945 --> 12:18.779
Thank you.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.240
<i>Everybody here sends their condolences.</i>

12:21.323 --> 12:24.160
-So, how are you holding up?
-I'm fine.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.537
Yeah? Would you say if you weren't?

12:26.620 --> 12:29.331
Probably not. What's the vibe like there?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.792
Oh, it's just disgust for Moss.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.713
I'm still not 100% convinced
that he was involved.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.132
Come on, his right-hand guy,
biggest donor,

12:38.215 --> 12:40.926
that cell phone video...
They're sure blaming Moss in Texas.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.597
Hmm. Yeah, well, fasten your seat belt.
It's gonna be a day.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.307
What, you know something?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.518
Just, the day before, things go bump.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.854
Thanks for calling. I gotta go.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.107
Emily, this is my offspring, Stephanie.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.109
-Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
-Hi.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.236
Thank you so much
for this opportunity to volunteer.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.780
Oh, well, at 4:00 a.m., when you remember
that you're doing this for free,

13:01.864 --> 13:03.115
gratitude may not be your first thought.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.618
But let me introduce you to the person
who'll show you the ropes.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.872
[Cornelius through TV] <i>I have a statement,</i>
<i>after which I'll take your questions. </i>

13:09.955 --> 13:10.998

13:11.081 --> 13:14.543
[Cornelius] <i>I begin by condemning,</i>

13:22.468 --> 13:25.095
<i>to be punished to the fullest extent</i>
<i>of the law.</i>

13:25.179 --> 13:28.682
<i>And should it turn out</i>
<i>that those responsible</i>

13:28.766 --> 13:32.811
<i>include persons associated</i>
<i>with my presidential campaign,</i>

13:32.895 --> 13:36.398
<i>then I owe the American people</i>
<i>the most profound apology.</i>

13:36.482 --> 13:41.529
<i>However, any insinuation</i>
<i>or outright accusation that I myself</i>

13:41.612 --> 13:46.075
<i>had any role in or any knowledge of</i>
<i>this vile conspiracy</i>

13:46.158 --> 13:49.119
<i>is entirely without basis.</i>

13:50.246 --> 13:54.542
<i>And I am therefore owed</i>
<i>an equally profound apology</i>

13:54.625 --> 13:59.255
<i>from all of those individuals</i>
<i>who have so irresponsibly alleged.</i>

14:00.464 --> 14:01.757
<i>Most particularly,</i>

14:02.299 --> 14:06.762
<i>the holder of the high office that is</i>
<i>being contested in tomorrow's election.</i>

14:06.845 --> 14:12.142
<i>Mr. President, I, and the American people,</i>

14:13.561 --> 14:16.063
<i>eagerly await that statement of apology.</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:23.862
How did you feel
after you heard him say that?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
That I owed him absolutely nothing.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.536
[Cornelius through TV]
<i>And now I'll take your questions.</i>

14:30.619 --> 14:31.745
[reporter 1]<i> Have you spoken</i>
<i>to the president?</i>

14:31.829 --> 14:36.125
<i>Yes. And I made not only my displeasure,</i>
<i>but my disappointment in him known.</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:37.042
[reporter 2] <i>Are you concerned</i>

14:37.126 --> 14:39.712
<i>-about the impact that--</i>
-[TV switches off]

14:39.795 --> 14:42.381
I hope he gets a Latin King
for a cellmate.

14:42.464 --> 14:46.886
[chuckles] The conspiracy was about
keeping a state like Texas red.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.890
And now exposing it may result in exactly
what they were hoping to prevent.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.851
Yeah, karma's not a bitch.
She's a freaking queen.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.185
Please, sit down.

14:55.895 --> 15:02.192
I was wondering about your plans
vis-à-vis Aaron, the vice presidency.

15:03.485 --> 15:07.323
That's a completely sexist question.
Permission to begin again.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.411
I've been tremendously impressed with you
this past year.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.831
I think we work well together,
complement each other.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.750
Background, gender, age.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.711
I have no intention
of leaving my position.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.006
This isn't just about
not wanting to lose you.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.176
If we get the good news
that we expect to get tomorrow,

15:27.968 --> 15:31.347
I'd like to offer you the job
of White House Deputy Chief of Staff.

15:31.931 --> 15:32.806
Oh, my God.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.100
-You don't have to answer right--
-Yes. Yes.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.980
Of course. I...
I would be honored to accept.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.360
-Okay. Something I want to get a jump on.
-[both chuckle]

15:45.235 --> 15:47.154
It is manifestly unfair

15:47.237 --> 15:50.491
the kind of rehab facilities
available to the affluent

15:50.574 --> 15:53.744
that are impossibly out of financial reach
to most Americans.

15:54.828 --> 15:59.792
Start strategizing on a means to compel
Big Pharma, liquor, cigarette companies

15:59.875 --> 16:04.338
to designate a portion of their profits
to the cost of rehab.

16:04.421 --> 16:09.843
Hmm. So help get their customers
off the products that they spend so much

16:09.927 --> 16:12.388
in marketing dollars
enticing them to overuse.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.642
-Mmm-hmm.
-I love it. When you say strategize...

16:16.725 --> 16:18.602
Pull together an inter-agency team.

16:19.186 --> 16:22.564
Liaise with the appropriate
cabinet departments,

16:22.648 --> 16:24.024
subcommittees on the Hill.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.568
You're Deputy Chief of Staff.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.363
Kick a little ass.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.408
I will get right on it.

16:32.992 --> 16:33.867
[Isabel sighs]

16:46.755 --> 16:49.842
Really, Myles?
This is such a dweeb cliché.

16:49.925 --> 16:55.180
The thrashed hybrid, the congealed ramen,
the faint mist of flaming hot Cheeto dust.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.016
Okay, all right. What's up?

16:57.099 --> 16:59.643
I need you to wipe any trace of Pegasus
off my computer.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.395
Yeah, of course.
That was always part of the plan.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.023
No, you're not hearing me.
I want you to do it right now.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.108
-That's not possible.
-What?

17:06.191 --> 17:09.361
I can't do it remotely, Lorraine.
I need physical access to your computer.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.072
Which, correct me if I'm wrong,
is in a glass cubicle

17:12.156 --> 17:16.076
in the middle of, what, the busiest office
in DC for the next 36 hours?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.704
All right, tomorrow night.
After the polls close in the west,

17:18.787 --> 17:22.332
everyone will leave for the party. As soon
as the last man out shuts off the lights,

17:22.416 --> 17:25.210
I want you in there scrubbing
before the filaments cool.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.172
-Get your fucking car washed.
-All right.

17:31.341 --> 17:36.430
Let me ask you something. Why am I here?
If you're at peace with your conclusion.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.350
-I'm not at peace with my action.
-By action, do you mean--

17:40.434 --> 17:43.854
-My inaction.
-Okay, let's explore that.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.148
[Dennis] Does President Kirkman
have a comment

17:46.231 --> 17:47.983
on the statement by former President Moss?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.278
On the last day of the campaign,
the president is really just focusing

17:51.361 --> 17:53.572
on the issues that are most important
to the American people.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.490
-Seth?
-Seth!

17:54.573 --> 17:56.492
[Erin] Does he believe
in Moss' denial of involvement?

17:56.575 --> 17:59.411
<i>The president believes that</i>
<i>the investigation into this matter</i>

17:59.495 --> 18:01.121
<i>will be thorough and conclusive,</i>

18:01.205 --> 18:05.292
<i>and it's most appropriate for him to let</i>
<i>it unfold without any additional comment.</i>

18:06.001 --> 18:07.127
-[reporter] Seth?
-Colin.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.339
So the president stands by his statement
that he believes Moss was complicit?

18:10.422 --> 18:13.217
That's all I have for today. Thank you,
everybody. Don't forget to vote.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.220
[cell phone vibrating]

18:16.303 --> 18:17.179
Hey.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.306
Seth, did you speak with the president
before making those remarks?

18:19.389 --> 18:21.016
Yeah, I talked to him before I went up.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.603
<i>Hello?</i>

18:25.646 --> 18:28.065
I implicated Moss in a conspiracy.

18:28.148 --> 18:32.236
Now, I had evidence that might prove
his innocence, and did nothing with it.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.696
Because you felt
he bore responsibility regardless?

18:34.780 --> 18:38.117
-Yes, and I didn't want to reward him.
-In what sense?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.993
Moss isn't a right-wing extremist.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.663
Hell, his record shows
he governed as a moderate.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.374
-But he changed?
-I prefer "cynically pivoted."

18:45.457 --> 18:46.792
Explain.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.544
Moss wanted to become president again.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.213
He knew in a three-way race,
the Democrats would run to the left.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.006
I'd stay in the center.
That left him with what?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.133
The right.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.927
So he rebranded himself
a hard-line conservative.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.597
Surrounded himself with bigoted zealots
like Detwiler and Brunton.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.142
He didn't believe
in their nativist bullshit.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.145
But he knew that the hard-line
conservatives would vote in a block.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.273
And in a three-way race,
that just might be enough to win.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.567
So, you wanted him to pay
for his dishonesty?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.277
Yes.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.737
By being dishonest yourself?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.783
Like you're being right now.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.415
Not coming forward, was that really
because you didn't want to reward him?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.208
[sighs]

19:29.168 --> 19:31.044
-No.
-Why?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.755
Because I wanted to win.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.552
[Aaron through TV]
<i>They came for you, Houston!</i>

19:39.261 --> 19:43.891
<i>And not to kill you. Their plan</i>
<i>was more hidden and arguably more evil.</i>

19:43.974 --> 19:46.185
<i>They came for your future.</i>

19:46.268 --> 19:48.729
<i>They came for your children</i>
<i>that would never be born,</i>

19:56.403 --> 20:00.240

<i>they didn't just come for you or for me.</i>

20:00.949 --> 20:03.368
<i>They came for every American.</i>

20:03.452 --> 20:06.872

<i>-How's it going?</i>
-Real good, actually.

20:36.526 --> 20:39.363
Almost worth the permanent nerve damage
from shaking 8,000 hands.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.157
Ugh. There's not enough hand sanitizer
in the world.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.578
-You know, we're gonna win this thing.
-Texas, huh?

20:46.662 --> 20:50.082
Game changer. Who would have thought.
Quite the legacy for Hannah Wells.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.959
Amen to that.

20:52.542 --> 20:56.004
Hey, this is... This is gonna be awkward.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.173
-Uh...
-[phone beeps]

20:58.257 --> 20:59.216
Yeah, shoot.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.719
-How's Isabel?
-Dude.

21:02.803 --> 21:06.223
I know she's living with you,
and you guys talk, right?

21:06.306 --> 21:08.934
-How's she feeling about me?
-What is this, middle school?

21:09.893 --> 21:13.188
Look, I screwed up. And I know that.

21:14.481 --> 21:17.359
-But if it cost me a future with her--
-You love her.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.904
<i>-I do.</i>
-So tell her. That's all I got.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.034
Hey, Seth, I'm sorry to put you
in the middle of all this.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.619
No, you haven't, and I'm not.

21:28.370 --> 21:32.124
-But just talk to her, man, straight up.
-Okay.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.255
[Louden] You didn't clear Moss
so you might win.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.339
I just said that.

21:39.423 --> 21:43.010
What you're trying to work out
is whether the ends justify the means.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.554
As far as I'm concerned
for the country, absolutely yes.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.933
No, for you, personally. Isn't that
what you're trying to reconcile?

21:51.018 --> 21:54.521
"What profits a man who gains
the whole world, only to lose his soul?"

21:55.230 --> 21:58.817
Well, I don't think we need to send out
a search party for your soul just yet.

21:59.443 --> 22:03.280
Your argument about Moss' enabling
and inauthenticity,

22:03.947 --> 22:06.450
they weren't specious or fallacious.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.785
Why didn't you take them
to the American people?

22:08.869 --> 22:12.748
You learn pretty quickly that politics
doesn't run on reason, it runs on emotion.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.751
People vote their instincts
and backfill arguments to fit them.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.586
If I'd released that recording,

22:18.086 --> 22:19.629
the voters that Moss would've lost

22:19.713 --> 22:22.132
would have had enough cover
to sit on their conscience,

22:22.215 --> 22:23.759
regardless of what point
I would have made.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.720
[crowd applauding]

22:31.266 --> 22:32.893
Thank you for that. Thank you.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.104
And for your incredible dedication
and tireless work

22:36.188 --> 22:40.484
on behalf of what, well, when we started,
seemed to be an insurmountable task,

22:40.567 --> 22:44.237
electing an Independent
to the presidency of the United States.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.406
And the fact that I even have
a chance tomorrow

22:46.490 --> 22:48.200
is owed to you,
the people here in this room.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.118
And I will be forever grateful.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.872
Now, we have put forward
over these last few months

22:53.955 --> 22:58.460
our best case to the American people.
But it is now in the voters' hands.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.714
So, to tomorrow. Thank you all. Thank you.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.800
[crowd cheering and applauding]

23:06.218 --> 23:08.345
[Tom] Thank you very much. Thank you.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.393
Did you feel a fraud?

23:16.645 --> 23:20.315
Not then. That came later.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.071
[sniffles and sighs]

23:26.154 --> 23:27.823
[cell phone ringing]

23:30.659 --> 23:32.244
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.830
Late notice,
but the president's invited us,

23:34.913 --> 23:38.333
you, me and Aaron, to the Residence
for drinks and dessert,

23:38.416 --> 23:41.711
<i>to sort of bookend that dinner we had</i>
<i>back in January when you came back.</i>

23:41.795 --> 23:44.297
The one he thinks of
as the kickoff to the campaign.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.591
<i>You there?</i>

23:48.051 --> 23:50.637
Uh, yeah. Um... I'm on my way.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.355
[Seth] You ready to maintain
a frozen smile

24:00.438 --> 24:01.648
through the entire State of the Union?

24:01.731 --> 24:03.608
I'm planning on doing bunny ears
behind his back.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.320
-Just make sure you use both fingers.
-[Aaron chuckles]

24:07.404 --> 24:09.823
And there she is. What's your pleasure?

24:09.906 --> 24:11.324
A single malt, please.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.286
What does it say
that her drink is manlier than mine?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.121
-Everything, really.
-[chuckles]

24:16.872 --> 24:18.165
Thanks.

24:20.041 --> 24:24.796
To all of you, who believed in me
before I was sure I believed in myself.

24:25.297 --> 24:29.968
And for helping me to answer one of
Emily's on-point questions in early days,

24:31.094 --> 24:32.971
why was I running for president?

24:33.680 --> 24:34.973
Thank you all.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.894
To stopping Moss
and his merry band of eugenicists

24:38.977 --> 24:41.730
from reshaping the country
in the image of <i>Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

24:41.813 --> 24:43.982
[chuckles]
To being the people's president.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.944
I thought it was to be a welcome break
from politics as usual,

24:48.028 --> 24:50.947
disingenuousness and craven calculation.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.910
To restore integrity and honesty
to the public sphere.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.289
-All right, yeah, all that too.
-[Aaron] I'll drink to that.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.876
[Tom] Joe, thank you very much.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.630
Oh, man, I can feel my blood sugar spike
just from looking at that.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.840
Ladies first.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.802
Why not? Conscience be damned.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.848
[Seth] Thank you, Mr. President.
Good night.

25:16.932 --> 25:17.766
Good night.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.226
-Mr. President.
-Aaron.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.102
Sir.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.022
[sighs] Emily, could you stay
for a moment, please?

25:25.941 --> 25:26.942
Of course.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.823
You think I owe you an explanation.
I don't.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.075
Because you're the president.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.662
No, because you came to me
in the 59th minute of the 11th hour

25:38.745 --> 25:40.789
with a recording,
wouldn't tell me where it was from.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.207
-To protect you.
-One that purportedly

25:42.290 --> 25:45.001
would have exonerated Moss from having
anything to do with this conspiracy.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.795
Not purportedly, plainly.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.714
We didn't have enough time
to verify its authenticity.

25:49.798 --> 25:50.757
I don't believe this.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.386
You honestly think that I would have
risked the presidency of the United States

25:54.469 --> 25:56.137
over a recording I knew nothing about?

25:56.221 --> 26:00.558
This is so beneath you, sir.
You are self-justifying, grasping--

26:00.642 --> 26:02.394
-Emily, watch your tone.
-I'm sorry.

26:02.477 --> 26:06.606
Did I not say, "With all due respect"?
I'm having a little trouble mustering it.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.734
Okay, enough.
This was my call to make and I made it.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.152
I don't owe you an explanation.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.823
Hmm. Just as well,
because I certainly didn't get one.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.661
Best of luck tomorrow, Mr. President.

26:24.457 --> 26:27.627
-[Louden] Well, she gave it to you good.
-Yes, she did.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.213
Do you feel like you deserved it?

26:30.297 --> 26:31.298
[sighs]

26:32.340 --> 26:34.551
I guess that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.653
-[Sasha] Sleepless? Again?
-Hey.

26:54.237 --> 26:59.409
It looks like tomorrow'll bring good news,
if it's not jinxing to mention.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.703
The hard part's over, in any event.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.123
I've learned that running
isn't the hard part. [chuckles]

27:05.999 --> 27:08.293
Does governing keep you up
nights like this?

27:08.376 --> 27:09.502
Sometimes.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.547
But it's not the job, either.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.257
What, then?

27:16.092 --> 27:17.761
Knowing if you're worthy of it.

27:19.304 --> 27:23.850
The voters believe you are.
They're about to return you to office.

27:23.933 --> 27:27.729
[scoffs] We'll see. The big question is,
do I deserve it?

27:29.939 --> 27:31.441
Where's that coming from?

27:34.527 --> 27:40.742
You should unburden yourself to someone,
even if just in prayer.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.454
Try to get some rest.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.666
-Night.
-Night.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.761
[Louden] So, you reached out to me.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.847
Well, God wouldn't take my call.
[chuckles]

28:07.227 --> 28:08.228
Hey.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.652
-I need five minutes with the president.
-He left instructions not to be disturbed.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.737
-That don't apply to me.
-He said you'd say that.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.784
-What if this is a national emergency?
-Is it a national emergency?

28:24.160 --> 28:25.662
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

28:26.663 --> 28:27.664
A little bit.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.294
-Thank you, Russell.
-Don't mention it.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.674
Volunteers, where are my turnout numbers?

28:37.757 --> 28:41.136
If I can't get them before cable news,
what am I not paying you for?

28:41.219 --> 28:42.679
-[Stephanie] Here you go.
-Thank you.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.063
[blinds whirring]

28:56.568 --> 29:01.740
You have done great work, Dontae.
And I'm not promiscuous with my praise.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.616
I appreciate you saying.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.204
Listen, you and Emily are tight, right?

29:09.205 --> 29:10.749
What is going on with her?

29:12.041 --> 29:12.917
What do you mean?

29:17.881 --> 29:21.217
-Her mom dying.
-But I think there's something else.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.970
I've been on the trail with the president.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.557
Dontae, people are gonna
call me about you.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.101
I can really help you in your career.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.355
Sorry, I got nothing.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.150
Well, thank you, Dontae.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.031
[blinds whirring]

29:47.202 --> 29:48.119
[scoffs]

29:52.457 --> 29:55.043
So, what you're saying is,
you didn't trust the voters?

29:55.126 --> 29:56.711
How does that make you feel?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.588
You're a voter.
How does that make you feel?

29:58.671 --> 30:00.423
I ask the questions.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.258
My responsibility
is to the American people.

30:02.342 --> 30:06.054
So, yes, I chose not to throw a lifeline
to this race-baiting fraud

30:06.137 --> 30:08.431
because I don't think
he's fit to run the country.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.434
-In your view.
-In my view. Yes, in my goddamn view!

30:12.018 --> 30:14.354
I know I'm sounding undemocratic here,
but let's be honest.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.147
How democratic is this country, really?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.817
With the electoral college,
gerrymandered districts.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.028
Isn't that straying a little bit
into self-justification?

30:23.363 --> 30:27.617
Isn't it simpler? That, as president,
you just thought you knew better?

30:28.993 --> 30:29.994
[sighs]

30:37.168 --> 30:40.547
Thank you all for coming.
I won't keep you.

30:40.630 --> 30:45.468
I know a lot of you have victory parties
to attend and concession wakes to avoid.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.761
[all chuckle]

30:46.845 --> 30:49.055
[Mars] I asked you,
congressional leadership,

30:49.138 --> 30:51.099
here to discuss our way forward.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.852
If the exit polls are to be believed,

30:53.935 --> 30:56.563
it's shaping up to be
a resounding Kirkman win.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.400
A protest vote,
against an alleged conspiracy.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.609
Hardly a mandate.

31:01.693 --> 31:05.196
The accidental president redux,
with still no governing majority.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.616
Face facts, Harper.
He's a day-one lame duck.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.327
That's exactly what I expected to hear

31:11.411 --> 31:15.582
from you esteemed beltway insiders,
canny old pros.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.751
Tell that story, be my guest.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.504
Do your performative gridlock,

31:21.588 --> 31:26.217
that sorry, lazy excuse
for not doing the people's work.

31:27.635 --> 31:28.928
Here's our story,

31:29.888 --> 31:33.600
that American voters gave
a decisive electoral victory

31:33.683 --> 31:36.060
to a fierce Independent to govern,

31:36.144 --> 31:39.188
because they've had it up to here
with all of you.

31:40.023 --> 31:44.027
That this is a repudiation
to partisan stalemate

31:44.110 --> 31:48.031
and government by self-interest
and glorified bribe.

31:48.114 --> 31:52.952
And we won't just hammer this message
on every media outlet.

31:53.036 --> 31:58.666
We're gonna hammer it in your home states,
your districts, where you live.

31:58.750 --> 32:03.546
Blows taking dead aim
at your lobbyist-fed, exposed bellies.

32:04.130 --> 32:08.051
Because the only thing people respond to
in this town is fear.

32:08.551 --> 32:13.431
So know this. Anyone obstructionist,
who doesn't meet us halfway

32:13.514 --> 32:17.769
in good faith negotiation
and mutual compromise, will get primaried.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.730
And not from the left or the right,

32:20.813 --> 32:25.234
but from that dead bull's-eye
sensible center,

32:25.318 --> 32:27.320
where the American majority lives.

32:28.071 --> 32:31.282
This election is the drawing in

32:31.366 --> 32:35.244
of the waves that foretells the tsunami.

32:36.037 --> 32:39.666
So, either you play ball and play fair,

32:39.749 --> 32:43.336
or be prepared to be swept away.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.757
Have a good night.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.557
-What is it you're looking for from me?
-Are you kidding me?

32:57.266 --> 32:59.310
I get that you're not a priest
and you can't absolve me,

32:59.394 --> 33:01.354
but you gotta give me something,
for Christ's sakes.

33:01.437 --> 33:07.235
Tell me this self-loathing isn't justified
or oversized, or at least that it'll pass.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.945
You know that's not up to me.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.571
[scoffs]

33:10.655 --> 33:14.659
Patient, heal thyself.
Quite a racket you guys got going.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.286
Our time is past up.

33:20.623 --> 33:25.461
[sighs] At least tell me this.
Do you regret your vote?

33:31.217 --> 33:32.802
I ask the questions.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.597
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Doctor.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.520
[door opens]

33:42.603 --> 33:45.314
-Dad, they called it! You won.
-Oh!

33:46.607 --> 33:47.608
[chuckles]

33:49.152 --> 33:52.030
-You so deserve this.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.574
-I gotta go and get ready for the party.
-Okay.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.246
Mom would've been really proud.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.090
[crowd cheering and applauding]

34:21.559 --> 34:23.936
This is so crazy.
I'm hugging people I just met!

34:24.020 --> 34:25.980
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.253
You think he'll be able to govern?

34:49.337 --> 34:51.214
It's gonna be an uphill climb,

34:51.297 --> 34:55.635
which is why we can't leave this open
Virginia Senate seat up to chance.

34:57.678 --> 35:02.058
-You're considering a run.
-Not me. You.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.684
[scoffs] Very funny.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.106
-Mars.
-It's your dad's old seat.

35:09.190 --> 35:13.986
There is no one savvier about this town,
yet no career politician.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.322
And a drug addict. You buried the lede.

35:16.405 --> 35:19.867
Recovered, with a relatable story to tell.

35:19.951 --> 35:24.288
A triumph over the scourge
plaguing the state and the country.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.543
I don't feel very triumphant.
More like holding on by my fingernails.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.838
Then talk about that.
How it's a struggle every day.

35:31.921 --> 35:35.550
Look, the one takeaway
from this Kirkman win

35:35.633 --> 35:38.970
is that the electorate
is craving authenticity.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.391
Your father hosted all those
glittering dinner parties.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.017
You know what he once said to me?

35:45.977 --> 35:49.647
That you were always the smartest one
at the table.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.817
He never told me that.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.404
You neither.

35:56.487 --> 36:00.867
Well, you know, I was usually also
in attendance, so it cut both ways.

36:01.534 --> 36:05.329
But he was right.
Politics is not only in your blood.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.832
You've steeped in it your whole life.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.835
First at your dad's side, then mine.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.921
Your intuitive grasp,
seeing around corners,

36:14.005 --> 36:16.966
I have relied on it my entire career.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.219
You're very sweet to say all this.

36:20.303 --> 36:24.807
Sweet has nothing to do with it.
It's in my craven political interest.

36:27.226 --> 36:28.686
I just don't know if I could.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.813
Well, I do.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.817
And you're just gonna have
to trust me on it.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.904
I'm not gonna say think about it,
because I'm gonna make you.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.406
Every day until the filing deadline.

36:42.575 --> 36:45.661
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.254
[Tom] Hey.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.257
Ah! The once and future president.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.385
-I owe this all to you.
-No, it's always about the candidate.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.137
In my job, you just try not to fuck it up.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.055
[Tom laughs]

37:05.431 --> 37:07.558
We spent a lot of breakfasts
strategizing here.

37:07.642 --> 37:10.853
Yeah, the proverbial
frank exchange of ideas.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.105
-I got you to bend a little.
-More than I expected.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.815
Such is campaigning.

37:15.524 --> 37:19.070
I'll let you go. I just wanted
to personally say congratulations.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.241
Thank you, Lorraine, for everything.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.996
Oh. Mr. President.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.590
[knock on door]

37:39.674 --> 37:42.218
Come in, Seth. I swear I'm almost ready.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.348
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.018
[sighs]

37:52.603 --> 37:54.105
You look beautiful.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.483
Thank you.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.991
-Mr. Vice President.
-[chuckles]

38:06.117 --> 38:07.285
How does it feel?

38:09.412 --> 38:13.291
You know, I was at the Voto Latino party
when Texas put us over.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.543
And just to see the jubilation,

38:16.085 --> 38:19.588
the sense of pride and that acknowledgment
washing over everyone.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.925
And what it meant for them.
What it means to me.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.721
Isi, I have you to thank for that.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.309
-And that <i>canto de mierda,</i> Moss.
-[chuckles]

38:33.311 --> 38:34.812
That's my Isi.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.024
Which is my point.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.236
It just felt wrong
that you weren't there with me.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.448
It's wrong that we're not together.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.994
Because I love you.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.623
And I know I can't ask you to forgive me.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.960
All I can do is ask
that you give me another chance.

39:01.797 --> 39:06.510
You know, these last two days,
thinking of you as vice president,

39:07.720 --> 39:11.015
I'd burst into tears with no idea why.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.727
Until now.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.232
I can't be with you. I'm sorry.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.861
-Isi, just--
-It's not because of the infidelity.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.530
[stammering] It's something deeper,

39:27.448 --> 39:30.493
something that's always nagged at me
under the surface.

39:32.244 --> 39:35.748
-You never took me seriously.
-Isi, you can't say that--

39:35.831 --> 39:37.750
I don't mean as a romantic partner.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.669
I mean as a colleague,

39:41.545 --> 39:44.382
someone substantial and considerable.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.678
You making VP now
will only make that worse.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.848
-What are you--
-Mars Harper just promoted me

39:52.932 --> 39:54.934
to be his Deputy Chief of Staff.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.146
-Congratulations, that's--
-You see that? Right there.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.984
That surprise on your face
and in your voice.

40:04.693 --> 40:05.945
It's just...

40:06.862 --> 40:10.533
It's so clarifying that this man
who hardly knows me

40:11.325 --> 40:16.747
recognizes something in me
that my live-in lover never saw.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.625
-That's not fair, Is--
-No, you know what's not fair?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.253
In fact, what really sucks

40:24.296 --> 40:26.674
is that this is the greatest night
of your life,

40:28.968 --> 40:30.594
and I'm telling you this.

40:33.973 --> 40:36.308
But that life will have to go on
without me.

40:40.855 --> 40:44.150
-Okay, we're not done talking about this--
-We are.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.280
It's over.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.331
All right. [sniffles] Okay.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.126
I'll see you at the party.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.263
[crying]

41:28.527 --> 41:30.154
[Seth] Hey! We did it!

41:31.280 --> 41:34.825
Well, you did it.
I'm just a not-so-disinterested bystander.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.287
Oh, man, you exercised the franchise.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.831
Or did you just borrow that from somebody
so you could fit in better?

41:40.915 --> 41:42.249
-I actually voted.
-[chuckles]

41:42.333 --> 41:44.502
Eyes wide open, but hopeful.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.882
-Looking for someone more important?
-No, no, no. [chuckles]

41:51.258 --> 41:54.512
-You got a date!
-Uh, not a date per se.

41:55.095 --> 41:59.934
-Someone you hope to hook up with?
-We kind of already have. Biologically.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.561
-It's Stephanie's mom.
-What?

42:03.687 --> 42:04.688
[mouths inaudibly]

42:12.446 --> 42:14.198
[inaudible]

42:16.992 --> 42:20.996
Hey. Shouldn't you be protecting
the vice president-elect?

42:22.289 --> 42:25.125
Off shift tonight. Hey, congrats.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.337
You know, I'm crediting
this entire win to you.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.588
[laughs]

42:31.006 --> 42:32.007
Is it cool?

42:34.718 --> 42:37.346
Fuck it. We won.

43:27.479 --> 43:30.816
FBI! Step away from the computer!
Federal agents, Mr. Lee.

43:30.899 --> 43:32.192
We need you to accompany us, sir.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.903
-Will you come cooperatively?
-Yes. Yeah.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.953
[inaudible]

43:46.248 --> 43:47.416
[chuckles]

43:48.876 --> 43:52.212
-Mars.
-Mr. Vice President-elect.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.758
-You know my wife, Lynn.
-Congratulations.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.926
I owe an awful lot to your husband.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.678
-No, no, no.
-No, no. His mentorship,

43:59.762 --> 44:02.598
-his guidance, his example. I--
-It's time, sir.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.642
None of this would've happened for me
if it weren't for you.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.101
Not true.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.437
That boy is a born politician.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.022
He is a star.

44:10.105 --> 44:13.108
Which is why you want him stumping for you
on your Senate run.

44:27.581 --> 44:30.292
-Emily.
-Hey.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.797
-Condolences about your mother.
-Thank you.

44:36.715 --> 44:40.844
-Is it true you had to be the one to...
-Yeah.

44:42.554 --> 44:45.849
-How awful for you.
-I appreciate that.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.897
I wanted to apologize over

44:53.023 --> 44:55.526
how I acted towards you
with the whole Aaron thing.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.319
-Totally understandable.
-No.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.614
No, it's fucked up to blame the woman

45:00.697 --> 45:03.700
when all of the anger should be
directed towards the cheating guy.

45:05.452 --> 45:07.079
Who I just ended it with for good.

45:08.163 --> 45:10.082
-Not because of--
-No. Uh...

45:11.083 --> 45:12.501
No, nothing to do with that.

45:14.128 --> 45:18.006
-We should grab lunch sometime.
-That'd be nice.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.635
I'm not feeling well.

45:21.718 --> 45:25.431
Could you just let people know
I went home? I mean, if anyone asks?

45:26.014 --> 45:28.725
-Yeah. Feel better.
-Thanks.

45:32.271 --> 45:33.647

45:55.627 --> 45:59.882
<i>But I would be remiss</i>
<i>for not noting the circumstances</i>

45:59.965 --> 46:03.218
<i>that led to needing to give</i>
<i>a concession speech this night.</i>

46:03.927 --> 46:08.056
<i>The erosion of a sense of honor</i>

46:09.099 --> 46:10.934

46:11.852 --> 46:14.354

46:14.438 --> 46:17.608

46:18.859 --> 46:21.403
<i>Because tonight, I can say with assurance</i>

46:21.487 --> 46:25.782
<i>that you most definitely will have</i>
<i>Cornelius Moss to kick around</i>

46:25.866 --> 46:27.576

46:27.659 --> 46:31.288

[Aaron] Thank you.

47:14.831 --> 47:15.832
Thank you.

47:17.292 --> 47:20.170
It is with great pride and pleasure

47:21.088 --> 47:24.466
that I introduce to you
our current and future president

47:24.550 --> 47:26.552
of the United States, Tom Kirkman!

[mouths indistinctly]

48:10.178 --> 48:12.931
Thank you for everything.
I'll be right back.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.827
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

48:34.453 --> 48:36.913
I am deeply humbled and honored

48:36.997 --> 48:39.541
by the incredible support my candidacy
has received

48:40.375 --> 48:42.794
from those celebrating with me
here tonight,

48:42.878 --> 48:45.714
to the tens of millions
across this great land

48:45.797 --> 48:48.508
who've entrusted me
with the most precious commodity

48:48.592 --> 48:51.928
this great nation has to offer,
their vote.

48:52.971 --> 48:56.433
[through TV] <i>It now falls upon me</i>
<i>to prove to you over the next four years</i>

48:57.017 --> 48:58.852
<i>that your faith in me was justified.</i>

49:00.479 --> 49:02.731
<i>Now, for those</i>
<i>who couldn't muster that faith,</i>

49:03.565 --> 49:06.026
<i>for whom this victory feels like defeat,</i>

49:07.069 --> 49:09.613
<i>I pledge to work equally hard for you,</i>

49:09.696 --> 49:12.407
<i>to listen to you,</i>
<i>to honor our differences,</i>

49:12.491 --> 49:15.619
<i>but always engage opposing ideas</i>

<i>-in a spirit of humility and respect.</i>
-[crying]

49:18.330 --> 49:22.167
For it is through the airing
of our differences that we grow

49:22.250 --> 49:24.836
as individuals and as a country.

49:25.462 --> 49:29.383
Acceptance of those differences
doesn't just make us a better people,

49:29.466 --> 49:32.511
it is the essence of what it means
to be an American.

49:32.594 --> 49:34.596
[crowd cheering]

49:36.807 --> 49:41.436
Now, I did not get here alone.
Many people contributed to this victory.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.522
-Lorraine Zimmer?
-Yeah?

49:43.605 --> 49:46.733
-FBI. Come with me, please.
-[sighs]

49:46.817 --> 49:48.485
[Tom] But the person I could not have
done this without...

49:48.568 --> 49:49.486
Yeah, okay.

49:49.569 --> 49:51.905
...standing beside me
right from the start,

49:51.988 --> 49:55.492
is your new vice president
and my friend, Aaron Shore.

49:55.575 --> 49:58.995
I knew you were treacherous.
I didn't take you for this stupid.

49:59.079 --> 50:01.957
You've just tainted the greatest victory
in presidential history.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.917
-[FBI agent] Ma'am?
-[Lorraine] Look at you,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.421
high on the fumes
of your moral superiority.

50:07.504 --> 50:09.673
You're the one
who fucked someone else's man

50:09.756 --> 50:11.466
because one day you felt sad.

50:11.550 --> 50:14.386
You're the one who leaked
Moss' gene results

50:14.469 --> 50:16.430
because you thought no one was looking.

50:16.513 --> 50:20.058
Hell, the way I heard it, you couldn't
even kill your poor mama right.

50:20.142 --> 50:22.352
-You're a fucking monster.
-I know what I am.

50:22.436 --> 50:25.021
I'm someone who wins.
What the fuck are you?

50:25.105 --> 50:28.150
-[FBI agent] We need to go, ma'am.
-[Tom] I would also like to take a moment

50:28.233 --> 50:31.194
and add a particular thanks
to Emily Rhodes,

50:31.862 --> 50:33.989
who's been with me
from the very beginning.

50:36.825 --> 50:40.912
She has seen me at my best,
and most assuredly, my worst.

50:41.496 --> 50:45.000
And whose highest of high standards
I will always endeavor to meet.

50:46.585 --> 50:50.881
Now, I began our campaign
noting that our politics felt broken.

50:50.964 --> 50:56.178
They say a presidential campaign
is like an X-ray into your soul.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.638
<i>Our institutions diminished.</i>

50:58.722 --> 51:00.724
<i>-Our discourse coarsened.</i>
-[crying]

51:00.807 --> 51:03.935
[Tom] <i>Let tonight be the first step</i>
<i>in setting all that right.</i>

51:04.019 --> 51:07.981
Is this just something I did?
Or is this who I am now?

51:08.607 --> 51:12.152
Let us come together,
restoring civility to our debates,

51:12.235 --> 51:15.197
transparency to our governance!

51:15.280 --> 51:17.073
Next time I give a speech,

51:18.742 --> 51:21.077
will there be some corner of my mind
just whispering...

51:21.161 --> 51:23.997
And above all,
honesty with the American people!

51:24.915 --> 51:26.875
..."You are so full of shit"?
