-[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-So, my dad played G&amp;G in high school.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.804
[Betty] All of our parents did.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.348
-What's that, Hiram?
-Fizzle Rocks.

00:16.808 --> 00:20.061
This house is no longer safe.
They'll watch over you now.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.396
Mom, are you out of your mind?

00:21.479 --> 00:23.898
[Woodhouse] You're safe
with the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.695
Framing Archie for murder,
conspiring to keep him locked away.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.156
An old-fashioned prison break
might be your best option.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.908
[Jughead]
You're breaking Archie out of juvie?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.162
[Minetta] <i>Ten thousand apiece.</i>
<i>You say that you saw Archie Andrews</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:39.080
<i>kill your friend Cassidy Bullock.</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:41.916
Your henchman, Minetta, is going down.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.046
If you added slots, table games,
you'd have quite the little gold mine.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.257
[Archie] Hiram Lodge has done everything
in his power to destroy me.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.884
I can't go back to Riverdale.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.553
-I'm not letting you go off alone.
-I'm not alone.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.430
Leaving is my best option, Jug.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.143
[train horn blaring]

01:02.854 --> 01:05.273
[Jughead] <i>The two young men</i>
<i>had been walking for days.</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:07.525
<i>Looking at them...</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:09.861
<i>you might think they were brothers.</i> <i>And in a way, they were.</i>

01:13.782 --> 01:14.949
<i>Brothers fearful...</i>

01:15.533 --> 01:19.037
<i>that Hiram Lodge might catch up to them.</i>

01:22.123 --> 01:24.584
[Betty on recording]
<i>Hi, this is Betty. Leave a message.</i>

01:24.667 --> 01:26.294
[Jughead] Hey. Betty, it's me.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.171
Just trying you again.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.340
Hoping you're okay.

01:30.423 --> 01:34.010
We're looking for a place to settle down.
I'll let you know when we do. Okay.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.595
Uh... I love you.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.347
Bye.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.390
Still no answer?

01:42.727 --> 01:44.562
Look, Jug, maybe you should go back.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.815
I'm fine.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.110
Really, dude, I'm gonna be fine.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.488
Archie, no offense, but Betty
took down a serial killer last year.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.533
You can't go five minutes
without being kidnapped

01:56.616 --> 01:58.243
or getting the crap kicked out of you.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.662
That was before you were marked for death
by Hiram Lodge.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.915
[Archie] It would be nice to stop looking
over my shoulder.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.501
-Just find somewhere to settle, you know?
-We will.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.255
When we find the right place,
we'll know. We'll feel it.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.632
Or maybe we're already there.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.516
Nice try. Let's go a couple more miles
before nightfall.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.643
Come on. Jug, we gotta bunk somewhere.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.038
[gun cocks]

02:45.039 --> 02:46.374
[girl] You're trespassing.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.669
Now let's see you do a little turn,
nice and slow.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.311
Who are you?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.479
I'm Cal. This is Biff.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.231
From Centerville.

03:12.901 --> 03:13.943
I don't like liars.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.528
Shoot them, Gracie.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.696
Wait. Wait.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.198
We got robbed on a train.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.242
They took all our money.
We've been walking for days. Just--

03:21.826 --> 03:24.454
We need some food and water,
and we'll be on our way.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.331
Put the rifle down.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.374
-I don't trust them.
-Do as I say.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.464
I'm Laurie Lake. This is Gracie.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.383
You boys like stew? Where's everyone else?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.315
I only meant...

03:52.982 --> 03:55.401
A farm this size, I thought there'd
be more people working it.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.780
A lot of the men in town are at a job,
down the river.

03:58.863 --> 04:02.367
Our father and our brother went with them.
They come back now and then.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.203
You have somewhere to stay?

04:05.286 --> 04:06.496
-We're good.
-[Archie] No.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.290
We should get out of your hair.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.669
You could stay, if you sleep in the barn.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.213
That's amazing.
Anything we can do to repay you?

04:15.296 --> 04:17.340
-[clearing throat]
-Just some farm work.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.551
I have some bales of hay I need to move.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.179
Just stay out of the main house.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.061
-Dude, we can't stay here.
-One night, Jug.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.021
-What's the problem?
-I don't know.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.565
Something about this place weirds me out.
It's...

04:34.816 --> 04:36.943
a little too American Gothic, even for me.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.446
You're right. Where is everybody?

04:41.239 --> 04:44.701
When I asked what her dad and brother did,
it seemed like she was lying.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.452
You mean like we are, Cal?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.788
-[chuckles]
-[Laurie] Am I interrupting?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.624
No. Not at all.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.461
I brought some extra blankets,
in case you guys get cold.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.548
Thank you, Laurie.

05:03.886 --> 05:04.721
All right.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.557
See you tomorrow.

05:09.017 --> 05:09.851
Good night.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.148
-Seriously?
-What?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.526
We have to stay on task. No distractions.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.612
I totally agree.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.073
No distractions.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.119
[rooster crowing]

05:32.790 --> 05:33.624
Hey.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.254
You missed eggs and bacon for breakfast.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.341
Meanwhile,
you are literally moving bales of hay.

05:41.841 --> 05:42.675
Yep.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.969
Feel free to help out, too.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.556
I'm going into town,
take some pictures before we hit the road.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.475
Remember?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.143
Like we said we would.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.479
Gonna be okay here?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.397
I think I'll be fine, Jug.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.249
Excuse me.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.005
Excuse me.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.215
Hi.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.219
I'm, uh... I'm a little lost.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.852
I saw some strange symbols
on the sides of the buildings.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.980
Didn't look as faded as the rest.
Know what they mean?

07:20.481 --> 07:22.775
Town wasn't always like this.

07:23.401 --> 07:28.072
First it was the jingle-jangle.
Now we're back to Fizzle Rocks.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.949
Fizzle Rocks. Like the candy?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.953
I used to eat that when I was a kid.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.873
That's normal Fizzle Rocks.

07:37.582 --> 07:42.003
What we got nowadays...
is laced with drugs.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.757
As for them symbols,
they started showing up in town

07:46.841 --> 07:49.969
about the same time
Fizzle Rocks trickled in.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.182
You've done so much for me.
You don't have to do this, too.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.725
I used to do this for my father.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.520
-And you did move all that hay.
-My dad's a construction worker, so...

08:00.730 --> 08:02.106
I'm used to physical labor.

08:02.899 --> 08:06.110
Well, there's a lot of that around here.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.820
[chuckles]

08:08.279 --> 08:11.115
If you and your friend wanna stick around
for a few days.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.077
I'm not sure about Cal, but...

08:16.370 --> 08:17.914
I would be, I think.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.211
There's something about this place
that just makes me feel at home.

08:23.961 --> 08:24.962
I don't know why.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.360
I'm sorry, Laurie.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.988
I just-- I can't do this right now.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.827
There's a girl back home.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.456
There always is.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.875
Though we're not together,
I still love her.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.628
If you love her, Biff, why are you here?

09:10.299 --> 09:11.509
Because of her father...

09:12.635 --> 09:13.719
and my past with him.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.434
Sometimes when you try to survive,
it's easy to lose sight of who you are.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.317
Laurie, my name's not Biff.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.321
It's Archie Andrews.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.033
I'm from a small town called Riverdale,
which I can't go back to.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.743
Because of your girl's father?

09:39.370 --> 09:41.205
Hiram Lodge. Yes.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.959
[sighs] I'm sorry I lied to you.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.336
It's okay. Archie Andrews.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.883
Around here,
everybody's running from something.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.053
Let me see about getting you some lunch.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.872
[girls giggling]

10:39.430 --> 10:40.264
Are you a king?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.892
I'm actually a Game Master.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.228
-Started as a Hellcaster, like you.
-What level?

10:46.312 --> 10:50.608
Almost three. On my way to four.
Where'd you learn to play?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.653
Our older brothers used to play,
before they left town.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.113
Yeah, I noticed that
there are no men here.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.990
-All gone to work building a prison.
-Prison?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.409
My brother told me
it's not just for prisoners.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.328
It's for making Fizzle Rocks, too.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.747
The prison doubles as a drug lab.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.666
Where you shacking up, Game Master?

11:08.125 --> 11:11.337
-Uh... Lake Farm.
-[Tiffany scoffs] Gracie's house?

11:12.129 --> 11:14.924
-We used to be friends with her.
-Acts like she's too good for everybody, even though her daddy works
for the Man in Black like ours do.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.389
-Who's the Man in Black?
-[Pearl] He's always in a black suit.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.265
Gets driven around in a black car.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.143
This town's his now.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.145
Hiram.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.195
I made you some more eggs.
I hope you don't mind.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.198
No, that is more than okay. Thank you.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.867
Don't thank me.
You helped me with the hay,

11:41.951 --> 11:44.370
and helped me
pass the time a little bit quicker.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.956
In my book, we're even.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.044
These are delicious.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.207
[inaudible dialogue]

12:43.971 --> 12:45.014
Are you all right?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.974
Let's get you out of here.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.644
-Laurie knocked me out. Where is she?
-She's inside.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.188
With Hiram Lodge.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.606
What?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.027
I don't understand.
How do the girls know him?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.779
Her dad and brother work for him.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.449
They make drugs inside the prison,
which the kids take, then play G&amp;G.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.535
All of this is connected, Archie.
Hiram owns this whole town.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.162
Probably many others like it.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.164
-Let's go.
-Or we could stay and fight.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.374
No, Archie.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.668
This is our one chance...

13:15.628 --> 13:16.796
to take it all back.

13:18.964 --> 13:22.551
He'll walk in thinking I'm tied up.
Let's surprise him and take him out.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.094
That's a bad idea, trust me.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.389
-There's gotta be something. A pitchfork.
-Hey. Look at me.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.851
You're not thinking clearly.
It's two against four. They have guns.

13:31.268 --> 13:34.146
I get how bad you want this,
but we are underprepared.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.857
They're going to kill us, Archie.
Archie, look at me.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.821
-Don't say what I think you're gonna say--
-Jughead.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.113
I can kill him.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.744
-I can.
-I know.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.624
But right now we've gotta go,
while we still have time.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.459
There's nowhere he won't follow me.

13:56.919 --> 13:57.920
I can't run from him.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.384
Let me end this nightmare,
once and for all.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.388
He's coming.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.849
Archie, I know he ruined your life.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.767
He's ruined a lot of lives. One day,

14:11.851 --> 14:15.145
he will get everything he deserves.
I swear. But it's not today.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.189
-It's not now. We have to go.
-Jughead.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.151
All right, if you do this,
if you kill him...

14:21.861 --> 14:23.445
will Veronica ever forgive you?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.203
-Before I let you in, to be clear--
-Yes.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.622
Archie in exchange
for your brother and father.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.625
Their debt to me will be paid.
You have my word.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.592
<i>♪ Do you have a feeling in your heart? ♪</i>

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
What's going on here?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.351
Where is he?

14:55.811 --> 15:01.901
<i>♪ It's always been there</i>
<i>No matter how far that you run ♪</i>

15:01.984 --> 15:03.235
<i>♪ Setting sun ♪</i>

15:06.030 --> 15:08.824
[Jughead] For a second there,
I didn't think you'd listen to me.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.992
Neither did I, Jug.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.828
Neither did I.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.165
You were right about one thing, though.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.960
Hiram's gonna follow you,
or us, wherever we go.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.713
We'll always be outnumbered and outgunned.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.215
So, what's the plan?

15:28.719 --> 15:29.720
We'll go see my mom.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.516
You sure we should do that?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.186
[Jughead] You got a better idea?

15:49.281 --> 15:50.324
What are you doing?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.951
I'm leaving the Pembrooke.

15:57.164 --> 15:57.998
Veronica.

15:59.917 --> 16:04.004
I realize that you're upset about Archie,
but you can't just go running after him.

29:02.615 --> 29:03.575
And now?

29:04.409 --> 29:08.079
[Betty] <i>Remember to smile, Betty,</i>
<i>and you'll be out of here in no time.</i>

29:08.997 --> 29:11.916
The old jungle gym
at Riverdale Elementary.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.836
I used to play on it every recess.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.715
Very interesting.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.884
Step forward, Nellie.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.510
It's time for your candy.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.096
[Betty] <i>My mom and her delusions.</i>

29:25.180 --> 29:27.390
<i>She has a fondness for this place.</i>

29:27.724 --> 29:31.269
<i>She thought the Sisters would keep me safe</i>
<i>from the Gargoyle King.</i>

29:32.061 --> 29:33.521
<i>She probably didn't realize</i>

29:33.605 --> 29:36.733
<i>that she was sending me</i>
<i>right into the belly of the beast.</i>

29:39.194 --> 29:40.904
-What is this?
-A treat.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.323
Every patient gets candy
for good behavior.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.785
[Betty] <i>Fizzle Rocks.</i>

29:47.160 --> 29:48.620
<i>Aka, drugs.</i>

29:49.204 --> 29:50.914
<i>Why are the Sisters dosing us up</i>

29:50.997 --> 29:53.249
<i>with the same stuff the Midnight Club took</i> <i>the night</i>
<i>of Principal Featherhead's murder?</i>

29:57.128 --> 29:58.087
Thank you so much.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.215
Bless you, my child.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.010
[Betty] <i>And what, oh, what</i>
<i>is in that file, I wonder?</i>

30:16.815 --> 30:18.441
How are you settling in, roomie?

30:19.442 --> 30:20.276
Ethel.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.445
What are you doing here?

30:23.029 --> 30:24.823
Sister Woodhouse thought you might benefit

30:24.906 --> 30:27.116
from having a roommate
who's familiar with the system.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.327
[Betty] <i>What a nightmare.</i>

30:29.869 --> 30:30.703
Fun.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.208
Uh... Did you just come from art class?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.335
[Ethel] Oh, no. That's my warrior board.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.629
It's like a visual collection
of my destiny.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.256
It helps me manifest my goals.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.466
[Betty] <i>If I didn't already</i>
<i>have an escape plan,</i>

30:43.550 --> 30:45.593
<i>I'd really start going crazy in here.</i>

30:45.677 --> 30:47.220
<i>As soon as I have what I need,</i>

30:47.303 --> 30:49.430
<i>I'll find the door marked X</i>
<i>in the basement</i>

30:49.514 --> 30:51.391
<i>that Veronica used</i>
<i>when they broke Cheryl out.</i>

30:51.474 --> 30:52.809
Isn't the King marvelous?

30:53.351 --> 30:56.354
Since I came here,
I've had wonderful conversations with him.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.190
Wait, what are you saying?

30:59.274 --> 31:02.110
That you've been talking
to the Gargoyle King in person?

31:02.193 --> 31:05.238
-Yes. We've become very close.
-Really?

31:08.783 --> 31:10.827
Think you could introduce us?

31:11.494 --> 31:13.329
No. That's Sister Woodhouse's job.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.914
What is?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.876
The Sisters take patients
into the Gargoyle King's chamber

31:17.959 --> 31:19.002
when they misbehave.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.546
Other girls are scared of him,
but I'm not.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.591
Where's his chamber?

31:24.674 --> 31:27.302
I can't tell you.
That's Sister Woodhouse's job.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.599
Hmm. You'd tell Jughead.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.769
About Jughead...

31:38.438 --> 31:41.608
I wasn't going to mention this,
but since you brought him up...

31:44.027 --> 31:44.861
Betty.

31:45.653 --> 31:47.739
I don't think Jughead's into you anymore.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.534
We connected
when we played the game together,

31:51.618 --> 31:54.829
and things got pretty hot and heavy
in the bunker.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.956
[Betty] <i>This psycho bitch.</i>

31:57.040 --> 32:01.794
Oh, he definitely told me about
how you blackmailed him into kissing you.

32:05.548 --> 32:06.799
I knew you would do this.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.385
You always acted
like you're better than me.

32:09.469 --> 32:12.305
-You and all your shallow friends.
-What are you talking about?

32:12.388 --> 32:14.057
This isn't Riverdale High.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.767
Rules are different here.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.311
I'm the queen bee, not you, Betty Cooper.

32:18.394 --> 32:21.105
And if you wanna get better,
change your attitude.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.317
And you have to be honest with yourself,
and with others.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.112
And you can start
with what you threw into the trash.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.995
Ethel, I'm sorry.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.999
I want to be your friend,
if you'll have me.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.961
Can you just not tell anyone
about the candy?

32:43.419 --> 32:46.047
Can you just keep it between us, please?

32:47.256 --> 32:48.216
Roomie.

32:51.010 --> 32:51.844
Okay, Betty.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.263
I'll keep it our little secret.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.975
But you really should take the candy.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.310
It's super delicious.

33:01.729 --> 33:03.564
[Agnes] <i>Be careful of the thorns, girls.</i>

33:06.317 --> 33:07.443
Very good, my child.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.489
[Betty] <i>That's funny.</i>

33:11.990 --> 33:15.118
<i>The Sisters don't serve maple syrup</i>
<i>in the cafeteria.</i>

33:15.952 --> 33:19.372
<i>And why would Claudius Blossom</i>
<i>be making the delivery?</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:23.001
<i>What the hell?</i>

33:31.342 --> 33:35.096
<i>What kind of business does Hiram Lodge</i>
<i>have with Sister Woodhouse,</i>

33:35.179 --> 33:37.306
<i>and how are the Blossoms connected to it?</i>

33:40.768 --> 33:42.562
Hey. Do you know who that is?

33:44.480 --> 33:46.065
They call him the Man in Black.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.275
He's an angel donor.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.861
Helps the sisters
with anything they may need.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.571
Isn't that nice of him?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.114
Yeah. Amazing.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.158
<i>Wait a minute. According to my mom,</i>

33:55.241 --> 33:57.618
<i>Hiram was the one</i>
<i>who brought the Fizzle Rocks</i>

33:57.702 --> 33:59.662
<i>to Ascension Night all those years ago.</i>

33:59.746 --> 34:02.206
Back to it, Betty.
Idle hands make the devil's work.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.876
[Betty] <i>Bite me.</i>

34:06.794 --> 34:10.423
<i>What did Hiram give the Sisters?</i>
<i>And what did Woodhouse give him?</i>

34:11.549 --> 34:14.135
<i>Maybe there's a clue</i>
<i>in those files they're keeping.</i>

34:14.343 --> 34:17.388
<i>If I can just find the right office</i>
<i>or a records room...</i>

34:21.601 --> 34:25.772
<i>Wait, this must be the Gargoyle King's</i>
<i>chamber Ethel was talking about.</i>

34:34.822 --> 34:37.075
[girl screaming]

34:38.993 --> 34:40.787
[girl grunting and whimpering]

34:49.420 --> 34:50.713
[girl sobbing]

34:51.672 --> 34:53.466
Hush. Hush, child. Hush.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.369
[Ethel] What do you think you're doing?

35:21.869 --> 35:23.496
This area is off-limits.

35:23.579 --> 35:24.580
Ethel, I...

35:25.998 --> 35:27.834
Know where the medical archives are?

35:28.459 --> 35:31.712
Sister Agnes sent me to fetch some files.
I got kind of lost.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.883
Silly Betty. Only the infirm are allowed
in the infirmary.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.512
Time to go back to our room now.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.805
While I'm watching.

35:41.139 --> 35:41.973
Okay.

35:50.189 --> 35:53.025
<i>Acting normal. This me acting normal.</i>

35:53.818 --> 35:55.319
<i>All I need is a pen,</i>

35:55.403 --> 35:58.656
<i>a bobby pin that hasn't</i>
<i>been dulled down, or--</i>

35:59.532 --> 36:00.575
<i>A paperclip.</i>

36:00.658 --> 36:01.492
<i>Bingo.</i>

36:09.333 --> 36:11.252
Hey, Betty, come play with us.

36:13.754 --> 36:15.339
Uh, no, thanks, Ethel.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.300
Betty, you said we were friends.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.760
And friends play together.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.389
[Betty] <i>This isn't how I imagined myself</i>
<i>getting to those medical files,</i>

36:23.472 --> 36:27.268
<i>but since only the infirm</i>
<i>go to the infirmary...</i>

36:29.312 --> 36:31.147
You wanna be real friends, Ethel?

36:33.482 --> 36:34.692
Hmm. That's weird,

36:34.775 --> 36:37.987
because real friends
don't kiss each other's boyfriends.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.285
That's because the Gargoyle King
wants Jughead and me to be together.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.037
-Oh, yeah?
-We're gonna be a ship.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.039
Oh.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.832
Ethelhead?

36:52.251 --> 36:53.419
In your dreams.

36:53.502 --> 36:54.462
[chuckles]

36:54.837 --> 36:55.838
You're just jealous.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.799
Jealous that Jughead and I are worthy,
and you're not, but here's the thing, Betty, okay?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.887
You're never going to be worthy.

37:02.970 --> 37:05.181
And the Gargoyle King?
You'll never meet him.

37:05.681 --> 37:06.724
[Betty] <i>Here we go.</i>

37:11.187 --> 37:13.272
Sister Woodhouse, she's having a seizure.

37:14.607 --> 37:15.691
Ethel, get the nurse.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.277
[Betty] <i>Yes, Ethel, get the nurse.</i>

37:18.361 --> 37:21.280
<i>And God willing,</i>
<i>she'll take me exactly where I need to go.</i>

37:21.364 --> 37:24.033
There, there, Elizabeth.
You're going to be all right.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.410
We'll get you to the infirmary.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.790
[Betty] <i>Well, they bought it.</i>

37:30.873 --> 37:33.417
<i>They actually believe I had a seizure.</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:36.963
Let's re-evaluate her dosage
as soon as possible.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.297
Yes, Sister Woodhouse.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.526
[Betty] <i>Jackpot. There you are.</i>

38:11.914 --> 38:13.124
<i>Elizabeth Cooper.</i>

38:18.045 --> 38:21.424
<i>"Two doses of Bullio Lapis, mornings only.</i>

38:21.632 --> 38:22.633
<i>Sporadic seizures.</i>

38:22.717 --> 38:25.386
<i>Patient seems to be responding well</i>
<i>to testing.</i>

38:25.469 --> 38:28.848
<i>Per HL, increase dosage after first week."</i>

38:29.724 --> 38:31.017
<i>HL?</i>

38:33.394 --> 38:34.228
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

38:34.312 --> 38:37.690
<i>Is Hiram Lodge using patients</i>
<i>at the Sisters as lab rats?</i>

38:37.940 --> 38:40.693
<i>And what is Bullio Lapis? Unless...</i>

38:41.277 --> 38:42.528
Fizzle Rocks.

38:42.611 --> 38:43.612
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

38:43.988 --> 38:45.281
<i>Okay, now that I have my proof,</i>

38:45.364 --> 38:47.408
<i>it's officially time</i>
<i>to get the hell out of here.</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:50.911
<i>The door to escape is in the basement.</i>

38:56.625 --> 38:59.420
<i>X marks the spot. Just like Veronica said.</i>

38:59.920 --> 39:00.880
<i>I'm so out of here.</i>

39:05.593 --> 39:06.427
No.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.725
No.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.438
[Ethel] There she is.

39:19.273 --> 39:20.107
Ethel.

39:20.858 --> 39:21.901
Sister Woodhouse.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.487
I just-- I got lost again.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.073
I told you she was up to no good,
Sister Woodhouse.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.909
Restrain her.

39:30.576 --> 39:31.869
No.

39:33.079 --> 39:33.913
No.

39:34.914 --> 39:35.831
[grunts]

39:38.084 --> 39:39.835
What are you doing, Sister Woodhouse?

39:40.419 --> 39:43.672
You've been a very bad girl, Betty.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.258
You haven't been taking your candy.

39:48.844 --> 39:49.678
Ethel.

39:50.137 --> 39:52.556
-Steady her.
-No.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.143
[grunting]

40:01.273 --> 40:03.526
My King. My Savior.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.403
Guide me through the night.

40:05.694 --> 40:08.364
Bless me with your darkness,
gift me with your flight.

40:08.447 --> 40:12.159
She needs a good, strong talking-to
from the King, I think.

40:20.876 --> 40:23.212
I was wrong. You are gonna meet the King.

40:42.773 --> 40:43.607
No.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.204
The King awaits you.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.551
[Betty screaming]

41:15.055 --> 41:17.224
Now let's try this again, shall we?

41:21.353 --> 41:22.771
Tell me what you see, Betty.

41:24.773 --> 41:25.774
A dead body.

41:29.445 --> 41:30.696
What do you see now?

41:31.113 --> 41:31.947
The Black Hood.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.287
And now?

41:42.917 --> 41:44.752
The Gargoyle King.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.796
Wonderful, wonderful work.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.757
You've already made progress.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.259
[Betty] <i>My King. My Savior.</i>

41:52.593 --> 41:54.011
<i>Guide me through the night.</i>
