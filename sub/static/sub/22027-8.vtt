WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:01.535
.

00:01.569 --> 00:04.105
- It occurred to me you left
your sweatshirt at my place.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.376
This is not a good idea.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.278
- Maybe it's a one-time thing.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.181
- Hey!
You can't be in here.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.083
We gotta get out
of the building now.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.250
- Get down!

00:18.552 --> 00:20.554
*

00:20.588 --> 00:22.556
What's your name?
- It's Bria.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.393
- I put the drugs back.
- They weren't for me.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.164
[indistinct chatter,
phones ringing]

00:37.671 --> 00:39.607
- Hey.
How you doing?

00:39.640 --> 00:40.708
- Hi.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.743
- Heard you were still here,
so,

00:42.776 --> 00:45.279
figured I'd swing by
and check on you.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.315
- They said it's a concussion,
but I feel fine.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.184
- Yeah, they're always extra
careful with head injuries.

00:50.218 --> 00:53.287
My dad was just in the hospital
for a stretch, and uh--

00:53.321 --> 00:55.489
these are pretty useful.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.859
In fact, I became the
reigning queen of Crazy Eights.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.095
- Congrats.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.332
- Uh, I guess so.
Yeah.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.699
- Alright.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.204
Winner gets
a deep dish pizza.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.373
Jokers are wild.
No backsies.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.377
- You laugh now...

01:20.314 --> 01:22.383
- Let's make it two pizzas.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.817
- Bold move.

01:23.851 --> 01:24.885
- We'll see about that.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.654
- Mm-hmm.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.290
*

01:34.628 --> 01:36.197
- Tired of the wobble.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.199
- Well, jam paper
under the legs.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.867
- I'm not taking advice
from the woman

01:39.900 --> 01:41.335
that duct-tapes her
mirror to the wall.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.371
- Oh, how does
such a smart guy

01:43.404 --> 01:45.506
miss the most
obvious solutions?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.341
- Paper was
the first thing I tried.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.578
- Mm.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.712
- Hey.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.615
- I swung by the hospital
before shift

01:54.648 --> 01:57.318
to check on that girl
from the clinic fire, Bria.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.752
- The, uh--
the drug thief?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.155
- Yeah, she didn't have any
drugs in her system.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.523
- I don't know.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.325
Something's off
with the whole picture.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.893
The nurses say she doesn't get
a lot of visitors.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.361
Or any.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.230
Supposedly there's a dad
in the picture,

02:09.263 --> 02:12.166
but I--I didn't see him
and I didn't wanna push.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.501
I mean, you met her.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.469
She seems like an okay kid,
right?

02:15.503 --> 02:18.272
- I only talked to her
for a sec, but yeah,

02:18.306 --> 02:22.310
she didn't seem like trouble.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.914
- Oh, there she is.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.682
"

02:28.716 --> 02:30.951
You were supposed to make the
grocery run for the apartment.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.653
We're down to two rolls of
Angel Soft.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.754
- Oh, right.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.223
I'll do it right after shift.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.526
- Hey.
Get the kind with aloe.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.662
- Noted.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.502
- You were barely home all
weekend.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.371
Go on, spill it.
You're seeing someone.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.543
- Um, I don't need my roommates
broadcasting what I do

02:55.576 --> 02:57.378
off-shift to
the entire firehouse.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.712
- That's the whole point of
being roommates.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.381
- Well, all I'll say is,

03:00.414 --> 03:05.286
it's not anyone's business who
I see or when I see him.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.922
- I have a guess.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.392
Okay.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.561
- You know, that's cute
that you don't wanna tell us,

03:13.594 --> 03:17.365
but everyone knows
you can't keep a secret.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.934
- I am not gonna say
another word on the subject.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.770
It's Antonio.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.473
We reconnected when your dad
was in the hospital.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.576
It was just a moment that
turned into more moments,

03:28.609 --> 03:31.645
but I swear, it's not
the same thing as last time.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.348
I mean, neither of us
wants to make it a thing.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.317
- Brett.
- I know. I'm telling you.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.685
- Listen--

03:37.718 --> 03:39.653
- Ambo 61.
Truck 81.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.855
Change of address verified.

03:49.863 --> 03:54.001
*

03:58.038 --> 04:03.644
*

04:06.547 --> 04:08.416
- He was writing me
a speeding ticket,

04:08.449 --> 04:09.650
and then the car just
swerved out of nowhere.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.419
- Not me, but he's--

04:11.452 --> 04:14.522
- Over here. Help!

04:16.524 --> 04:18.759
It's okay.
I got you, Louis.

04:22.062 --> 04:26.367
*

04:30.871 --> 04:32.039
- I got pressure on it.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.407
I was running the plates.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.775
Louis was hanging
by the window.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.644
That truck came out of
nowhere, it never saw us.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.346
Bam! Louis goes flying like
he's made of nothing.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.613
- Otis, let's cut
the fence away.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.914
Dawson, see if you can
stabilize it.

04:40.948 --> 04:41.915
- It was just a routine stop.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.517
- Ain't nothing routine.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.818
- She was speeding.
We just got our coffee.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.621
- Hey, Louis.
Stay with me, Louis.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.523
- Harris. Jeff Harris.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.924
Hey, can you guys
move any faster?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.460
He's dying here.
C'mon!

04:52.493 --> 04:53.961
- We're doing everything
we can, pal.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.463
- Harris, we need you to let go

04:55.496 --> 04:57.798
so the paramedics
can pack the wound.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.071
- We gotta leave the picket in
until a surgeon can remove it.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.974
- All we can do is stop
the blood as best we can.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.409
- He'll be dead in seconds!

05:08.442 --> 05:09.410
- Harris, you need
to calm down.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.444
- Let 'em do their jobs.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.682
*

05:14.715 --> 05:15.949
- Here we go.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.084
- Come on.
Come on.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.123
- Hey, why are you
moving so slow?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.658
- All right enough,
you gotta step back.

05:24.692 --> 05:25.893
- Get off of me.
- Hey!

05:25.926 --> 05:26.960
Harris, look at me.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.496
Your partner's hurt, I get it.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.930
You wanna do right by him?

05:29.963 --> 05:32.733
Walk away, let
the paramedics get him to Med.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.402
Alright?

05:34.435 --> 05:37.070
*

05:37.104 --> 05:39.573
- Guy lost his marbles.
- Alright, everyone just--

05:39.607 --> 05:41.975
- Okay, he's free.
Let's get him in the ambo.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.110
Easy with the backboard.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.846
- Okay, we got him.

05:51.419 --> 05:55.856
- Hey, I'll give you
an escort.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.994
- Look who swooped into town.

06:01.028 --> 06:01.995
- Julian.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.063
- Wallace.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.598
- Hey.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.766
How you doing?
You alright?

06:05.799 --> 06:06.800
- I'm good.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.936
- He just got in from Detroit.
Total surprise.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.504
- A good one, I hope.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.606
- I'll take any baby brother
time I can get.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.107
- Uh, how long are you
in town for?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.643
- Just a day or two.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.044
- The Langdon.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.479
- Aw, no, forget that.
You can stay with us.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.680
- Uh, not a chance.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.148
You'd have me changing diapers
and--

06:21.181 --> 06:23.717
- If you came to Chicago more
than once a decade,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.619
you would know that Terrence
has been out of diapers

06:25.653 --> 06:26.920
since he turned three.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.490
- Aw, come on, now.
So, how is business?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.158
- Julian just started
a new consulting company.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.760
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.529
- Yeah, and you know,
I requested the day off,

06:35.563 --> 06:37.130
but apparently Mrs. Britton
called in sick

06:37.164 --> 06:41.835
and they need me to take over
her home room period, so...

06:41.869 --> 06:43.437
- I told her I can
hang out here for a while

06:43.471 --> 06:44.772
until she gets back.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.541
Always wanted to see
the man in action.

06:49.943 --> 06:50.978
- Glad to have you.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.045
- Great.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.518
Have fun, guys.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.055
- Oh, you don't want no part
of Connie, trust me.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.826
Come on,
I'll take you on a tour.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.704
- You don't think I can sleep
with Antonio

07:16.737 --> 07:19.439
without getting hurt again.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.711
The thing is, I'm not
the same person I was

07:23.744 --> 07:25.112
when we were dating before.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.213
I don't know how to explain it.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.081
- Less Fowlerton,
more Chicago?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.083
- Exactly.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.520
I can handle myself.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.522
- I know.

07:41.695 --> 07:45.098
- Uh, give me a sec.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.839
- Bria.
Hey.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.041
- Oh, hey.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.845
- Yeah, the doctors said
I was good to go.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.580
- That's great.
- Yeah.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.584
- Oh, yeah.
My dad checked me out.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.853
You just missed him.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.555
He had to go
straight to work.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.523
If he shows up late,
they're, like, really strict,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.258
so I told him
I'd take the bus.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.961
Well, hop in.
We'll give you a ride.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.529
- No, it's not a problem.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.965
- Come on, it's freezing.
I insist.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.667
- Okay.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.615
- Over there.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.550
- I'll walk you up.
- No, it's okay.

08:36.584 --> 08:40.220
Really, you've done enough.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.022
Thank you, Gabby.
You've been so nice.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.858
- Yeah, my pleasure.

08:50.964 --> 08:57.671
*

09:03.744 --> 09:06.914
- I'm not sure.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.784
I don't like this.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.186
- Do you wanna--
- I'll be right back.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.122
- Okay.

09:18.158 --> 09:24.798
*

09:32.339 --> 09:33.707
Hey.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.359
What?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.261
Excuse me?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.164
- Bria, get your coat back on,
let's go.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.734
- Forget him, if he tries
to stop you, I'll--

10:00.768 --> 10:03.370
- No, you don't understand.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.206
*

10:06.239 --> 10:08.241
This is my dad.

10:22.055 --> 10:22.622
.

10:30.731 --> 10:34.101
How long has he been using?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.903
- He's not an addict.

10:35.936 --> 10:40.941
- I know the signs
of addiction when I see them.

10:40.974 --> 10:45.012
- He had an accident on the job
a few months back.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.847
They gave him six weeks.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.381
Then they said if he didn't
show up to work,

10:48.415 --> 10:52.119
they'd let him go.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.288
He started taking painkillers.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.361
I have to take care of him.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.463
I'm all he has.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.267
- Bria, I get it.
Believe me, I do.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.136
But you can't do this.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.871
- He needs those pills to move,

11:10.904 --> 11:13.907
let alone have any chance
of finding work again.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.710
The doctors at the clinic
won't prescribe more, so...

11:19.747 --> 11:22.182
What would you do?
Please, I'm dying to know.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.919
- Bria, he needs
professional help.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.155
And I know that
may be hard to hear,

11:28.188 --> 11:31.391
but you can't give him that.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.294
- Dawson.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.997
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.833
- Please, just don't call
Social Services.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.103
- They'll take him away.
I'll--

11:43.136 --> 11:44.371
I'll get help, I promise.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.505
- Bria, there are good people

11:45.538 --> 11:46.940
who will be able
to take care of--

11:46.974 --> 11:48.475
- I know, I know,
I know that, and I--

11:48.508 --> 11:51.311
I promise, please,
I will have him get help.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.746
You just need
to give me some time

11:52.780 --> 11:54.447
to figure this out for him.

11:54.481 --> 11:58.051
- Honey, you're 16.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.420
- Please.

12:00.453 --> 12:07.360
*

12:15.268 --> 12:16.804
This has my cell on it.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.472
You need anything, day
or night, 24/7, you call me.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.808
- I will.
Thank you.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.042
And I'm gonna come back
every day

12:22.075 --> 12:23.343
till you follow
through on that promise.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.412
- Okay, I will.
Thank you.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.748
- Thank me
by keeping your word.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.067
- That Coach Alvarez

12:47.100 --> 12:49.102
was not messing around
that year, let me tell you.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.872
Ten and one, Rose Bowl over
UCLA in their stadium?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.273
- That was the Ron Dayne year.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.809
- Oh yeah, we had Samuel,
we had Tommy Burke,

12:55.843 --> 12:57.244
Big Cecil Martin.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.279
Anyway, that's nothing.
You guys do the real work.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.981
Running into burning
buildings--

13:01.014 --> 13:02.515
- I don't know, I'd trade it
for a Rose Bowl win.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.051
- Ah, you wouldn't trade it
for these knees.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.519
- Hey, Chief.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.255
- I thought Donna was due back.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.058
- Ah, I lost track of time.
Everyone is so damn nice here.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.192
- Yeah, they are.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.828
- We got the best house in
the city because of this man.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.363
- I bet that's right.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.364
- There she is.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.431
- Sorry I'm late.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.268
I hope Julian wasn't
boring everybody

13:21.301 --> 13:22.502
with his Badger stories.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.971
- That's my talent.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.172
- I gotta catch up
on some paperwork.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.173
Great to meet you, Julian.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.409
- Alright, man, you too.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.078
Thanks for giving me
a day-in-the-life, man.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.479
It's real good work
you're doing here.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.881
- Ah, glad you enjoyed it.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.582
- Hey, I didn't get a chance,

13:35.615 --> 13:39.119
but I wanted to talk to you
about an opportunity tomorrow.

13:39.152 --> 13:39.953
- Sounds good.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.021
- Yeah.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.455
- Alright, great.
Fantastic.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.623
Alright, fellas. Take care.
- You too.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.125
- It was great hanging out
with you.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.626
- Good to see you, buddy.
- See you, man.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.561
- Have a good one.
- We'll see you.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.039
- Well, you put me in that
situation, at that age--

13:59.072 --> 14:00.908
well, not for my dad--
but for my mom?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.043
Sure, I would've done it.
Hell, I did.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.214
- The girl I visited
this morning, Bria--

14:07.247 --> 14:09.649
Brett and I gave her
a ride home from the hospital.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.287
- Mom's out of the picture.
Dad's hooked on painkillers.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.124
- 16.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.026
What?
What?

14:19.059 --> 14:21.929
- Well, girl tries
to steal drugs,

14:21.962 --> 14:23.530
checks herself out of Med.

14:23.563 --> 14:27.067
Maybe you're getting snowed.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.268
- You weren't there.

14:28.301 --> 14:32.139
- I know, which is why I wasn't
gonna offer an opinion.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.407
- Or you could just
trust my judgment.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.510
- All I'm saying--

14:40.480 --> 14:41.648
You know what?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.251
I'm just gonna
trust my judgment

14:44.284 --> 14:48.288
and take myself out
of this conversation.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.492
- So, what's your deal with
Donna's brother?

14:54.494 --> 14:58.431
- Well, if you were pretending
to be warm and welcoming,

14:58.465 --> 15:00.100
you, uh,

15:00.133 --> 15:02.936
you sure weren't
showing it much.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.505
- He didn't even play
in the Rose Bowl.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.974
He was hurt.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.175
Third week of the season.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.642
- Oh, did he leave
that information out?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.044
- Alright, listen.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.579
Playing division one
is still a big deal.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.947
- Yeah.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.015
Guy lives within
half a day's drive.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.316
The only time he shows up

15:16.349 --> 15:17.985
is when he's got some angle
that he's working.

15:18.018 --> 15:21.154
- Ah, now we're getting to it.
- Yeah.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.090
Did he come to our wedding?
No.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.259
Did he visit when
Terrence was born? No.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.695
He's interested in one thing
and one thing only,

15:28.728 --> 15:30.263
and it's Julian Robbins.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.232
- Donna seems taken with him.
- Yeah.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.336
Well, she won't let on,
but he hurts her feelings.

15:39.539 --> 15:44.344
All I'm saying is, some of
this might be in your head.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.080
Listen, Lord knows,
Cindy's parents drove me nuts

15:47.114 --> 15:49.082
while we were, you know,
crashing with them.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.583
The mother-in-law,
the brother-in-law.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.652
It's just all part
of this dangerous game

15:52.685 --> 15:54.421
called "being married."

15:54.454 --> 15:56.756
- Yeah.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.226
- I think I'm gonna handle
this one on my own.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.161
- Okay.
- Thanks very much.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.064
- Alright.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.303
- "The Human Centipede."

16:10.337 --> 16:11.704
- Uh, that's a "no."

16:11.738 --> 16:13.673
- Aw.
"Black Mirror"?

16:13.706 --> 16:14.707
- Mm, already binged.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.280
- '33, '76, '05,
or "Skull Island"?

16:21.148 --> 16:23.283
What're you in the mood for,
Sylvie?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.317
- Whatever you guys want.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.585
- Well, I can't do
black and white.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.720
- "Skull Island" it is.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.322
Brett.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.158
I didn't mean to
bust your balls before.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.060
If you wanna go hang
with the new guy, don't...

16:33.093 --> 16:34.461
- Great.
You guys have fun.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.696
I will movie-night
the hell out of next week.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.039
*

16:46.073 --> 16:47.574
- I told you I had plans.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.410
- Hey, you can't blame me
for trying to change them.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.713
- You said this was
gonna be a one-time thing.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.183
Then we agreed it was
gonna be a two-time thing.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.617
- It is.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.220
- Then we hung out all weekend.

17:00.253 --> 17:04.257
- Yes, we did.

17:06.726 --> 17:14.101
*

17:31.218 --> 17:31.518
.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.285
- Henry.
- Yeah, raise up your head.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.622
And Henry's gonna go...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.290
- That's a little linebacker
right there, huh?

17:37.324 --> 17:38.858
- Ha,
don't you tell Donna that.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.262
She says, no careers
that involve helmets.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.696
- I'm thirsty.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.833
- Well, you go find Mama and
you get yourself a juice box.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.435
- Okay.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.806
- Bam!
Yeah, I'm thirsty myself.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.807
Can I get you a glass?

17:54.841 --> 17:55.908
- No.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.711
- So listen, I wanted to
talk to you about a project

17:58.745 --> 18:00.480
I'm working on.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.682
Now, the hardest hurdle to
clear in the consulting game

18:02.715 --> 18:04.851
is building up
your client roster.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.686
Business begets business,
you know what I mean?

18:06.719 --> 18:08.721
Gotta have clients
in order to get clients.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.191
- Okay.
- So, that in mind,

18:11.224 --> 18:13.360
I reached out to
a fire equipment manufacturer

18:13.393 --> 18:15.462
who's looking to get his foot
in the door in Chicago.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.230
Propes Fire Equipment.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.567
Now, they have a fantastic line
of fire-retardant gloves,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.835
they've been completely
shut down by city purchasing.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.904
- Well, that can be tough.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.140
- Look, I know this is
a big ask, okay?

18:27.174 --> 18:29.242
But if I can even
get a small purchase order,

18:29.276 --> 18:32.212
it'll go a long way toward
getting my firm off the ground.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.717
- A hundred pairs of gloves.
Five grand.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.321
- Uh, well, the check
will get made out to me.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.790
Uh, to my company.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.627
- Okay.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.630
You get me the information,
and I'll take a look.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.199
- My man, thank you so much.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.168
You will be impressed.
I promise you that.

18:55.202 --> 18:58.938
- I'm sure I will.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.310
- Hey, look who's back
behind the bar.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.412
- Ah, well, you were in the
shower when I left,

19:05.445 --> 19:06.779
or I would've mentioned it.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.448
- What happened, did you
get sick of hitting the town

19:08.481 --> 19:09.616
with a
different date every night?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.384
- Look, I don't
wanna shock you,

19:11.418 --> 19:14.754
but the pool of guys in Chicago
who can keep up with this

19:14.787 --> 19:16.189
is limited.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.360
- Mm-hmm.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.695
- Ugh, he got you good.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.598
- I've been biting down funny.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.235
And Cindy says if I don't go
and get it looked at,

19:28.268 --> 19:30.337
then she's gonna wire
my mouth shut herself.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.338
- Well, nothing's broken.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.539
Just keep icing it.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.806
- I'm gonna tell her
you said that.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.909
- I'm comfortable
with my diagnosis.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.044
- Good.

19:38.077 --> 19:41.481
- So, I've stopped asking Brett
who this mystery guy is.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.750
- Ah, decided to respect
her privacy, huh?

19:43.783 --> 19:47.720
- No, no. Let's just say
I'm making a deception check.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.523
It's a basic D&D move.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.292
I make a charisma roll
against Brett's wisdom,

19:52.325 --> 19:54.694
and if I roll high enough
then she buys into my ploy

19:54.727 --> 19:58.698
and reveals who
she's canoodling with.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.868
- Don't tell Lily
you play that game.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.437
Anyway, I think it's
a doctor from Med.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.639
- It's not.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.976
- C'mon!

20:16.015 --> 20:18.385
Hey.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.521
Wait, wait, slow down.
What?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.460
Okay, I'll be right there.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.895
Uh, Herrmann, I gotta run.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.363
- Okay.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.966
- It's Bria.
She's in trouble.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.903
- I'll drive.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.706
- He's in here.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.674
He's been sick
since last night.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.809
He won't stop throwing up.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.412
I am okay. I'm okay.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.879
- We gotta get him
to the hospital.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.481
- All right,
I'll call an ambulance.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.017
I mean, that's why
I called you.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.623
- Whoa, he's seizing!

20:56.656 --> 20:58.325
- Oh, God.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.959
- Yeah, this is Lieutenant
Kelly Severide with the CFD,

20:59.992 --> 21:02.595
I need a rolling ambulance
to 3408 North Hoyne.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.830
Adult male.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.298
- We need to lower his
temperature.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.334
Let's get his shirt off.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.903
*

21:10.937 --> 21:13.373
- Grab wash cloths, towels,
anything you can find.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.542
- Bria, now.

21:15.575 --> 21:22.782
*

21:37.830 --> 21:41.401
- Dawson!
He stopped breathing.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.503
- Dad!

21:43.536 --> 21:45.772
Dad.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.478
- Here, come on.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.414
- Ready, one, two, three.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.531
- Okay, I got him back.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.965
- Paramedics.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.536
- Yeah, in here.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.870
- Dawson.
- Campbell.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.372
- Withdrawing from opiates.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.907
He's running a fever.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.442
I tried to cool him down,
but he stopped breathing.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.077
Got him back.
His carotid pulse is strong.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.979
- Okay, let's tube him in
and get a line in.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.449
- Yeah.

22:32.485 --> 22:39.626
*

22:48.067 --> 22:51.370
[machine beeps,
beeping steadily]

23:01.914 --> 23:05.518
- Okay, he's stable.
Let's get him in the ambo.

23:08.555 --> 23:15.762
*

23:20.066 --> 23:21.634
- Alright.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.636
Campbell,
she's riding with you.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.805
- Okay, hop on.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.676
- They're gonna
split us apart now.

24:08.615 --> 24:15.822
*

24:28.601 --> 24:31.638
- Hey.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.640
Are you okay?

24:33.673 --> 24:36.142
- I am now.

24:40.747 --> 24:43.750
I'm sorry about earlier.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.154
- Me too.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.159
- I don't wanna talk about it.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.096
Not tonight.

25:20.252 --> 25:20.820
.

25:20.853 --> 25:21.453
- Hey, Dawson.
How's Bria?

25:24.624 --> 25:27.660
- I, uh--when I got
to the hospital,

25:27.694 --> 25:30.697
she was sleeping in
the bedside chair.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.164
Nurses had an IV in her dad,

25:32.198 --> 25:35.101
and uh, said his condition
was stable.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.604
Just typical
narcotics withdrawal.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.841
- Nurses didn't say anything,
and I didn't ask.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.976
I'm gonna stop by there
as soon as I get a chance.

25:44.010 --> 25:47.714
- Yeah, I will too.
She's a brave kid.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.359
- We're not communicating.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.961
It's just,

26:01.994 --> 26:04.664
I know how you feel about
the way I'm handling things.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.198
- It's doesn't matter
how I feel.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.635
You're gonna do whatever
you're gonna do anyway.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.969
- Just let me get
through this day,

26:10.002 --> 26:11.704
and make sure this family
isn't broken apart

26:11.738 --> 26:14.073
because a teen girl
reached out for my help.

26:23.916 --> 26:24.984
- The way that I see it,
I got two choices.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.653
I could write Julian a check,

26:26.686 --> 26:29.689
knowing that the CFD will
never see that money again

26:29.722 --> 26:31.824
nor any fire-retardant gloves.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.060
Or I can confront him.

26:34.093 --> 26:38.230
Tell him to get that
flim-flam show back to Detroit,

26:38.264 --> 26:40.733
hoping to survive
the fallout from Donna.

26:40.767 --> 26:41.768
- Alright.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.269
If you cut him the check--

26:43.302 --> 26:46.005
- I will repay the CFD
from my own personal account.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.140
- Are you sure that your
instincts are--

26:48.174 --> 26:49.876
- Look at that.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.044
Does that look legit to you?

26:52.078 --> 26:55.214
There is no company name.
No address.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.221
- All right,
from where I'm sitting,

27:02.254 --> 27:06.192
it's a loser either way
you slice it, Chief.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.126
- Yes, it is.

27:17.369 --> 27:18.671
- I figured it out.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.709
- I realized who Brett's
dating this morning,

27:22.742 --> 27:24.010
after you left early.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.945
- I had breakfast duty.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.881
I got Bisquick.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.917
Alright.
Who is it?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.318
- Antonio.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.020
No way.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.156
- Hm.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.225
- 99%.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.828
Heard her on the phone
saying something about Diego,

27:41.861 --> 27:42.995
Antonio's son.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.831
- Oh, there's a million Diegos.

27:44.864 --> 27:49.368
- And in the dryer,
I found... this.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.070
A men's large.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.039
- People come in here all the
time and use the laundry room.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.441
- The dryer at home.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.978
- We have to say something.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.947
- She shouldn't
be dating Antonio.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.314
He put her through
the ringer last time.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.716
- I think she can
handle herself.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.084
- No, she can't.
Trust me.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.820
We have to keep her from
going down that path again.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.456
- Morning, room dogs.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.926
- Hi.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.394
Don't.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.400
- Ambulance 61.
Man down from unknown causes.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.903
541 South Illinois.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.374
- If you ever wanna talk more
about you and Antonio,

28:28.407 --> 28:29.508
I'm here.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.343
- Okay, thanks.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.346
- Like, if you thought
I wasn't clear,

28:34.380 --> 28:37.383
or I didn't offer
enough information.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.388
Uh, it's been pointed out
to me--correctly--

28:42.421 --> 28:46.025
that I have been a terrible
communicator lately.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.526
- Not with me, you haven't.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.864
- Ambo 61, cancel that call.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.400
- Copy that, dispatch.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.534
Hey, we're at the Med.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.535
Can we stop over there?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.737
- Of course.

28:59.839 --> 29:03.042
That thing you said about
better communication,

29:03.075 --> 29:05.511
I think it's solid advice.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.179
- Well, I'm good at giving it,

29:07.213 --> 29:08.547
but not very good
at applying it.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.017
- Since we're here,
I'm gonna get some supplies.

29:12.551 --> 29:16.088
- Yeah, I'll just be a minute.
- Okay.

29:22.161 --> 29:25.564
- Hey.
How are you holding up?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.467
- He hasn't woken up yet.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.236
- He will.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.405
- The nurses are asking
a lot of questions.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.207
- Yeah, they have to.

29:41.580 --> 29:45.151
- Uh, just hang on a sec.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.196
- Gabby.
- Hi, Tina.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.931
Are you here for Bria Jameson?

30:00.299 --> 30:03.069
- Rescued her from a fire
a couple of weeks ago.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.204
She's a good kid.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.974
Her dad got himself
in a mess with painkillers,

30:08.007 --> 30:09.375
but he's not a danger to her.

30:09.408 --> 30:12.011
- But he's in no shape
to take care of her, either.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.514
- I know.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.450
All I'm asking is that you
give this one a longer look.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.987
I spent time with her.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.592
She's got a good heart.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.330
- Hey.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.932
Did you see a girl
who was just here?

30:32.965 --> 30:34.000
- Mm-mm.

30:42.208 --> 30:42.408
.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.275
- She's gone.
She's not at the hospital.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.345
She's not at the apartment.
I called Antonio.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.880
CPD is looking for her,
but he says

30:47.914 --> 30:48.915
there's only so
much they can do.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.282
You were right.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.218
I should've gotten Social
Services involved sooner.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.420
I just didn't think
she would bolt.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.487
- Don't beat yourself up.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.889
She was headed for foster care

30:56.923 --> 30:58.357
long before you came
into the picture.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.359
She ran away because she
didn't wanna be in the system,

31:00.392 --> 31:02.594
not because of anything
you did or didn't do.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.629
- He's right.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.197
You were just trying to help.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.900
- And I step in it
every time I do.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.369
With Bria.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.370
With Louie.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.972
- Oh, come on, now.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.941
As tough as that was,
Louie's in a good place,

31:14.974 --> 31:17.576
with his father who loves him.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.578
You know that.

31:24.150 --> 31:27.987
- I'm gonna go see
if there's an update.

31:28.020 --> 31:35.194
*

31:45.571 --> 31:47.639
- Ha, there he is.
- Yep.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.375
- Wallace.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.977
Hey, man,
I really appreciate this.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.344
I really do.
I can't even tell you.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.313
The company is so thrilled
they cracked this market.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.282
They said I had gumption.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.150
- Yeah, they're already asking
me to look into Indianapolis,

31:58.184 --> 31:59.285
Madison, Green Bay--

31:59.318 --> 32:01.020
- Who do I write
the check out to?

32:01.053 --> 32:03.389
- Julian Robbins Consulting.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.657
- Exactly.
Like I said, one-stop shopping.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.527
- Yeah.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.132
That's what you said.

32:13.165 --> 32:17.169
You know, Julian,
I, uh--

32:17.203 --> 32:18.637
I don't know, I just, uh--

32:18.670 --> 32:21.707
- Wallace, I wouldn't even
try to sell you this product

32:21.740 --> 32:23.009
if I didn't believe
in it myself.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.343
Now, I've been
around you guys.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.345
I know what you do for a
living, the places you go.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.715
I've seen these factory tests
with my own eyes.

32:29.748 --> 32:33.419
This is the best glove
on the market.

32:36.455 --> 32:42.728
*

32:44.663 --> 32:46.999
- Uh, actually, my client
came back with a discount,

32:47.033 --> 32:51.270
so the total on
the purchase order is $3,338.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.305
- Huh.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.380
Okay.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.453
- Hey, Otis.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.755
Did you know that a big
percentage of burn victims

33:09.788 --> 33:12.358
return to the habits that
cause burns in the first place?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.459
- Huh.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.161
- Yeah, like leaving
space heaters on,

33:15.194 --> 33:17.096
or candles on Christmas trees.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.765
You'd think they would learn,
you know?

33:19.798 --> 33:21.633
Get burned once, maybe--

33:24.203 --> 33:25.504
Dawson?
Stella?

33:26.838 --> 33:28.807
- We found Antonio's shirt
in the dryer.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.808
- Ugh.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.043
- We're roommates.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.378
You're supposed to tell us

33:32.411 --> 33:34.146
when a big change
happens in your life.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.481
- I thought you said the point
of being roommates was so

33:35.514 --> 33:36.682
that you could
broadcast my business

33:36.715 --> 33:37.749
to the entire firehouse.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.118
- Uh, Otis said that.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.419
- The point is,
we care about you.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.653
We don't wanna see you
get hurt again.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.222
- Yeah, it's true.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.257
- And you don't think
that I can handle myself.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.758
- I--
- New rule.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.561
Leave my things
in the dryer.

33:56.435 --> 34:00.706
- Uh, I didn't know
that you could cook.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.474
- Well, my mom always said,

34:02.508 --> 34:06.745
"Save a few surprises
for the special ones."

34:06.778 --> 34:08.714
Which you are.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.620
- Okay.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.821
C'mon, dig in.

34:15.854 --> 34:21.460
*

34:21.493 --> 34:24.763
What's going on?

34:24.796 --> 34:26.865
- Um,

34:26.898 --> 34:29.868
we've had a lot of
miscommunications going on

34:29.901 --> 34:31.770
at the firehouse.

34:31.803 --> 34:36.342
People closing themselves off,
not saying what they mean,

34:36.375 --> 34:39.611
or what they're
really thinking.

34:39.645 --> 34:44.750
In my opinion, it's better
to put it all on the table.

34:44.783 --> 34:48.154
Uh, this table smells great.

34:48.187 --> 34:52.324
I wanna stay and eat with you.
I--I do.

34:52.358 --> 34:55.594
But we both agreed that
we didn't wanna catch feelings,

34:55.627 --> 34:58.764
and I don't know if you were
serious or not, but I meant it.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.268
- Yeah.
No, of course.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.670
- Even though
I think you're great,

35:04.703 --> 35:09.208
and what we have is really fun,

35:09.241 --> 35:11.377
beyond that,
it--it doesn't work.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.216
Um.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.685
- No.
We said that.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.321
And we're still in agreement.

35:22.354 --> 35:25.391
But, c'mon,
you should stay and eat.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.193
- I, uh--
I don't think so.

35:27.226 --> 35:31.263
I think if I stay
and I drink a little wine,

35:31.297 --> 35:33.199
and we snuggle up together,

35:33.232 --> 35:38.537
we're just gonna do it
again and again.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.907
And one of us is
gonna get hurt.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.710
I think that's
where this leads.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.479
*

35:47.513 --> 35:50.549
I like you.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.619
But I think we were right
the first time.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.187
*

35:55.221 --> 35:57.289
- That's fine.

35:57.323 --> 36:00.759
*

36:18.377 --> 36:20.412
- Her dad said he had no idea
where she might've gone,

36:20.446 --> 36:22.414
and she doesn't have
a lot of friends.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.216
Should I reach out
to her school?

36:24.250 --> 36:25.951
See if they know anything?

36:25.984 --> 36:30.256
Yeah, I doubt they'd
give me any info.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.657
Where would you go,

36:31.690 --> 36:34.560
if you were 16 and scared,
and didn't wanna get caught?

36:34.593 --> 36:37.463
- Wouldn't go to a shelter.
They'd notify authorities.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.530
- Yeah.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.233
- You know, there's that
stretch of Milwaukee Avenue.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.435
I see teens
in those encampments.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.905
- She lives near enough to it,
I bet she has too.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.311
I'm going.

36:52.344 --> 36:55.347
- You're not going solo.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.449
- Your jaw is
still bothering you?

36:57.483 --> 36:58.650
If you want,
I'll write that officer up.

36:58.684 --> 36:59.751
- Ah, forget it.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.721
No, I know, I mean,
it's still sore, but I'm not.

37:02.754 --> 37:06.525
You know, the guy, he was just
trying to protect his partner.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.594
Could've happened to any of us.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.728
- Yeah.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.965
- Yeah.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.702
- Donna.
- Hey.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.740
- Come over here.
- Okay.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.709
*

37:23.742 --> 37:26.445
- Julian told me
what you did for him.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.316
He doesn't like to talk
business around me.

37:30.349 --> 37:33.485
But he--
well, he really appreciated it.

37:33.519 --> 37:35.787
- Well, regarding that,

37:35.821 --> 37:39.425
I got something
to admit to you, Donna.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.960
I thought maybe your brother

37:41.993 --> 37:43.962
wasn't such a trustworthy guy.

37:43.995 --> 37:47.533
- No.

37:47.566 --> 37:51.937
It was all over your face.

37:51.970 --> 37:55.374
- I was wrong.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.376
- I figured he would
win you over.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.644
I just couldn't force it.

37:58.677 --> 38:03.014
- Huh.
You know me so well.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.083
- I do.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.886
*

38:10.922 --> 38:17.896
*

38:32.711 --> 38:39.685
*

38:39.718 --> 38:42.120
- Hey, you know
a girl named Bria?

38:42.153 --> 38:44.923
- No, I don't think so.

38:44.956 --> 38:52.330
*

38:54.165 --> 38:57.836
- Herrmann.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.505
- I, uh--

38:59.538 --> 39:01.740
I thought you had that
captain's meeting tonight.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.844
- Well, she was just here.

39:05.877 --> 39:12.584
*

39:12.618 --> 39:14.486
- Hey, do you know
a girl named Bria?

39:14.520 --> 39:18.490
5'4", brown hair.
- Mm-mm.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.034
- Hey, you know
a girl named Bria?

39:29.067 --> 39:33.905
- No, I don't know who that is.

39:33.939 --> 39:40.979
*
