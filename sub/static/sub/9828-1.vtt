00:28.303 --> 00:32.808
Universal. Y'all been large for years.
Yo, Spike, start the movie, G.

00:35.519 --> 00:38.021
Flavor Flav, you've done it again.

04:30.472 --> 04:31.723
He's gotta come outside.

04:31.932 --> 04:35.144
Every time we waste our time here,
we always missin' games.

04:35.352 --> 04:37.354
Yo, Bleek!

04:37.563 --> 04:39.356
Yo, Bleek!

04:39.565 --> 04:43.277
- You coming out to play?
- You're wasting time on him.

04:43.485 --> 04:45.904
I know, man. Yo, Bleek!

04:46.113 --> 04:47.991
We're going to miss the game!

04:48.867 --> 04:51.536
Boys! Boys!

04:51.745 --> 04:54.414
Boys, please be quiet!

04:54.622 --> 04:57.751
Sorry, Mrs Gilliam, we wanted to know
if Bleek can come out.

04:57.959 --> 05:01.254
I understand that,
but this noise has got to stop.

05:01.463 --> 05:03.757
- Psst!
- Oh, man!

05:07.093 --> 05:08.636
Bleek.

05:08.845 --> 05:11.055
<i>Bleek!</i>

05:11.264 --> 05:13.893
I told you to tell your friends
not to come around.

05:14.101 --> 05:15.853
Leave the boy alone.

05:16.061 --> 05:18.606
- Can I go outside now?
- When you've finished.

05:18.814 --> 05:20.775
- What about then?
- We'll see.

05:20.983 --> 05:26.113
- Let the boy be a boy, have some fun.
- He could be a bum for all you care.

05:26.322 --> 05:28.282
Running the streets with those kids.

05:28.491 --> 05:32.495
<i>Almost within walking distance
of Forbes Field.</i>

05:32.661 --> 05:34.747
<i>He ls just 21 years old.</i>

05:36.500 --> 05:40.754
That child's going to drive me
up the wall. Go tell them to go home.

05:40.962 --> 05:44.341
- You don't let me do nothing.
- You hear what I said?

05:44.549 --> 05:46.843
Go tell him to go home.

05:48.053 --> 05:49.054
Bleek!

05:49.262 --> 05:50.514
Bleek.

05:50.722 --> 05:52.682
Are you coming out?

05:52.891 --> 05:55.268
Yo, Ty,
what'd I tell you about that stuff?

05:55.519 --> 05:57.354
- Are you coming out?
- When I'm done.

05:57.604 --> 05:59.648
- Done what?
- Finished my lesson.

05:59.856 --> 06:01.234
- Forget him.
- We're going.

06:01.442 --> 06:05.071
- I said I'll see you later.
- I'm glad my moms ain't like your moms.

06:05.238 --> 06:08.407
- She lets me do whatever I want.
- Me, too.

06:08.616 --> 06:12.537
- Come on down, you fucking bum!
- Giant, who you cursing at?

06:12.745 --> 06:15.123
- You!
- You're a effing bum.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.334
- I'll see you later.
- We'll see you later, mama's boy.

06:18.543 --> 06:20.962
- Sissy.
- Who you calling a sissy?

06:21.212 --> 06:23.548
- You!
- You're a sissy, sissy.

06:23.756 --> 06:26.343
When I finish my lessons,
I'll come down.

06:28.011 --> 06:31.557
- Man, he does this every time.
- Thanks for nothing.

06:31.765 --> 06:34.143
We'll win the game without you.

06:34.393 --> 06:37.229
Bleek!
Get your butt out of that window.

06:42.317 --> 06:44.278
Throw the ball, man!

06:46.405 --> 06:48.824
Mommy,
I never get to play with my friends.

06:49.032 --> 06:51.703
Now they callin' me a sissy.
I ain't no sissy.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.707
- A sissy?!
- Don't pay those fools no mind.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.711
I'm sick and tired of the trumpet.
I hate the trumpet!

06:59.919 --> 07:03.673
All the money I paid for that horn?
You must be losing your mind.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.509
- You better play that trumpet.
- Look...

07:06.718 --> 07:08.845
That child will drive me up the wall.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.390
- Don't say that.
- I can say it if I want to...

07:12.599 --> 07:15.394
You got a lot of time
to be with your friends.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.355
- Like when?
- I don't want you to grow up like them.

07:18.606 --> 07:23.110
- After your lessons.
- I have to play this stupid trumpet.

07:23.319 --> 07:28.115
- This instrument can be your friend.
- Shut up! Shut up!

07:28.324 --> 07:30.409
- I'm not having this.
- We'll go to a game.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.828
- I don't want to go.
- I got a game on, OK?

07:33.037 --> 07:35.081
- Go look at it.
- You spoiled him rotten.

07:35.289 --> 07:40.337
He's not worth a damn. Listen.
Shut up! Don't you talk back to me.

07:40.545 --> 07:45.467
I want you to pick up the horn,
and you're going to play the scales.

07:45.675 --> 07:49.012
Do you hear me?
And you're going to do it right now.

07:49.262 --> 07:53.517
Boy, I think you better do
what your mother says, OK? Now?

07:56.937 --> 07:58.897
I still hate it.

08:04.779 --> 08:09.534
Good boy. Damn. I'm missing the game.
It's for the pennant here.

10:02.984 --> 10:06.781
He's a chucker, man.
He comes off the bench shooting, Bleek.

10:06.989 --> 10:11.619
Never gonna see no pass from this guy.
He's a selfish ballplayer.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.621
You need to get rid of him.

10:13.830 --> 10:18.084
It's your team. It's your band.
You're the coach. Fire his ass.

10:18.292 --> 10:21.295
Every night, three-hour solos.
Bleek, what's up?

10:21.504 --> 10:23.464
It's your band.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.927
Get rid of this guy.
Go out there and play.

10:28.136 --> 10:29.762
Great.

10:29.971 --> 10:31.097
God.

10:31.306 --> 10:33.725
Bleek, just talk to the guy, all right?

10:36.562 --> 10:37.938
Talk to him.

11:25.696 --> 11:27.948
All right!

11:28.157 --> 11:30.826
Left Hand Lacey on the piano.

11:31.035 --> 11:33.621
Left Hand.

11:35.289 --> 11:39.335
The earl himself.
The earl of rhythm.

11:39.585 --> 11:42.171
- Rhythm Jones on the drums.
- Thank you. Thank you.

11:42.379 --> 11:44.715
On the bottom, the bass,
Bottom Hammer.

11:44.924 --> 11:48.553
- Rock bottom, that's my man!
- Bottom Hammer.

11:48.804 --> 11:53.600
On tenor and soprano saxophone,
Shadow Henderson.

11:55.060 --> 11:58.021
- Shadow Henderson.
- Shadow, I love you.

11:58.939 --> 12:02.901
- My name is Bleek Gilliam.
- He's the best, huh?

12:03.151 --> 12:04.861
- He's the best, that guy.
- The best.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.947
Your band! It's your band!

12:07.823 --> 12:09.909
Thank you for coming.
You didn't have to.

12:10.118 --> 12:13.579
You could have stayed home
and watched Arsenio Hall or something.

12:13.788 --> 12:17.583
No, listen,
I got nothing against the brother.

12:17.792 --> 12:21.045
But er... thank you again for coming.

12:21.254 --> 12:23.881
This concludes our first set.
We'll be back soon.

12:24.090 --> 12:28.428
We got some beautiful waitresses here,
so put them to work.

12:28.678 --> 12:30.888
Give them some business and a fat tip.

12:32.390 --> 12:33.683
Speaking of fat...

12:33.933 --> 12:37.104
Don't get mad, Bleek.
I'll kick your ass.

12:37.312 --> 12:40.732
I know I'm gonna hear it now.
Butterbean.

12:49.408 --> 12:52.327
Nice, boy. Nice set.

12:52.536 --> 12:55.581
You see them girls out in front?
The girl in purple?

12:55.789 --> 12:58.041
When she crossed her legs,
I saw sparks fly.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.171
- What's up, man?
- She got a big baseball booty.

13:01.379 --> 13:03.173
Oh, man, she was fine!

13:03.381 --> 13:05.341
She was looking at me the whole show.

13:06.384 --> 13:09.679
She was looking at me
the whole motherfucking show, man.

13:09.888 --> 13:12.766
Yo, cut the bullshit, hold up.

13:12.932 --> 13:16.394
Shadow, what's up with this ego stuff?
What's up with the outing?

13:16.603 --> 13:19.355
- Grandstanding!
- You're the only one complaining.

13:19.564 --> 13:22.150
- Everybody else is OK.
- Everybody who?

13:22.358 --> 13:24.195
The audience got no problem.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.864
All you doing
is playing for the audience?

13:27.114 --> 13:29.867
- That's what I do.
- That's ego, grandstanding.

13:30.075 --> 13:34.371
- Do I tell you what to play?
- ls your name on the marquee?

13:34.580 --> 13:37.875
- Shadow sounds good, man.
- Who asked you, Left Hand?

13:38.083 --> 13:41.337
- Nobody asked me.
- Well, shut the fuck up!

13:41.587 --> 13:45.925
What the fuck is this?
You shut the fuck up, you midget!

13:46.133 --> 13:50.347
- My name is Giant, all right?
- Blame your motherfucking mother, man.

13:50.555 --> 13:54.351
- On the real side.
- Why you talking about my mother, man?

13:54.559 --> 13:57.979
- Stop talking about my mother.
- On the real side.

14:01.399 --> 14:04.945
Yo, chill.
Everybody chill for one second.

14:05.153 --> 14:08.448
Relax on the solos, OK?
Bring them down a little bit, all right?

14:08.657 --> 14:11.118
- Could you do that for me?
- Down to an hour.

14:11.326 --> 14:13.246
Maybe an hour, 45 minutes?

14:13.955 --> 14:16.082
You do have an option.
You can always quit.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.419
- What?
- Don't be playing with my balls.

14:20.628 --> 14:23.506
- Yo, hold up, man.
- Here, take your balls.

14:24.757 --> 14:27.969
Well, you right.
You right. I could quit.

14:28.177 --> 14:30.930
- Hey, wait a minute!
- He ain't going nowhere.

14:31.139 --> 14:33.933
- Where you going?
- To the bathroom, right?

14:34.142 --> 14:37.145
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- He's always going.

14:40.441 --> 14:43.735
I like women with big asses.
Why brothers drive Cadillacs.

14:43.986 --> 14:46.155
Can't get all that ass in a Volkswagen.

14:47.656 --> 14:50.409
The first thing they be saying,
''Kiss my ass''.

14:53.620 --> 14:57.040
Some ugly women in here, too, tonight.

14:57.916 --> 15:00.627
How you doing?

15:00.794 --> 15:03.673
When I said ugly,
I'm looking at your ass.

15:05.258 --> 15:08.303
I like an ugly woman.
They easy to get along with.

15:09.345 --> 15:12.348
Pretty woman, too...
You know how they do.

15:12.599 --> 15:15.143
''Fuck you. I'll do what I want to do.''

15:15.351 --> 15:18.813
Ugly woman easy to get along with.
They don't want no trouble.

15:20.315 --> 15:22.901
You can tell an ugly woman anything,
can't you?

15:23.151 --> 15:28.532
Hey, bitch, I'm going to the moon.
I'll be back in a couple of days.

15:28.741 --> 15:31.035
''Well, you be careful.''

15:31.243 --> 15:35.164
''I don't want nothing to happen
to you now, cos you know I...

15:35.372 --> 15:37.708
cos I love you.''

15:37.917 --> 15:39.877
''Oh, I love you.''

15:41.086 --> 15:44.131
''Please don't call me a bitch
in front of the kids.''

15:44.381 --> 15:47.927
All right, whore, I'll be back
in a couple of days. Goddamn.

16:29.804 --> 16:33.182
Hey. Hey, wake up.

16:33.433 --> 16:36.686
- I'm up.
- Wake up. You're not up.

16:36.894 --> 16:39.021
- I'm up. I'm up.
- You're not up.

16:39.230 --> 16:43.444
I'm up.
I do not want to go to school today, OK?

16:43.694 --> 16:45.612
I'm not going.

16:47.906 --> 16:49.908
Get up, get up, get up!

16:51.410 --> 16:52.995
I'm up now.

16:53.203 --> 16:54.997
You'll be late for school.

16:55.205 --> 16:58.041
Your children will have
their little hearts broken.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.627
Yeah, speaking of broken hearts, Bleek,

17:00.836 --> 17:03.172
you know what my mother
used to tell me?

17:03.380 --> 17:06.634
She used to say,
''Don't ever marry a musician,

17:06.843 --> 17:09.387
let alone go out with one.''

17:09.596 --> 17:16.269
She said I'd be inviting grief and pain
and tears and heartbreak to my doorstep.

17:16.519 --> 17:18.771
Your mother wasn't talking about me.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.940
Maybe not.

17:21.148 --> 17:25.987
You're a good brother, Bleek,
but you still don't know what you want.

17:26.195 --> 17:29.449
Guess it's time for confessions
of a modern-day dog, huh?

17:29.658 --> 17:33.370
Well,... like it or not,...
you're a dog.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.916
You are a dog.

17:37.124 --> 17:41.796
You're a good doggy, a nice dog,
but you're a dog nonetheless.

17:42.046 --> 17:45.299
What can I say?
I'm not going to argue the point.

17:45.508 --> 17:47.426
You know how I am.

17:48.511 --> 17:50.679
- With men, it's a dick thing.
- A dick thing?

17:50.888 --> 17:52.807
A D-l-O-K thing.

17:56.311 --> 17:58.814
A D-l-O-K thing.

18:07.906 --> 18:09.825
Hey, Bleek, you're late.

18:10.033 --> 18:11.243
Three minutes.

18:11.451 --> 18:15.080
Probably one of your lady friends
held you up.

18:16.957 --> 18:18.500
- Hi, Mr Gilliam.
- Hello.

18:18.708 --> 18:22.004
Sorry I can't stop. I'm late for school.
Bye-bye.

18:26.509 --> 18:29.762
- What?
- You something else, you know that?

18:31.264 --> 18:34.809
- How's the arm?
- I'm off the disabled list.

18:38.646 --> 18:40.148
You love her?

18:40.398 --> 18:42.358
I like her.

18:42.608 --> 18:44.903
You like her.
What about the others?

18:45.112 --> 18:47.990
I like her, too. I like women.

18:52.244 --> 18:54.204
Just be careful.

18:56.206 --> 18:59.209
Don't bring babies into this world
until you're married.

18:59.418 --> 19:02.087
If I see another 16-year-old,
black, unwed mother,

19:02.296 --> 19:05.674
pushing a stroller, a baby in one arm,
another on the way,

19:05.883 --> 19:07.176
I don't know what I'll do.

19:07.384 --> 19:10.180
- I hear you.
- I can still smoke 'em.

19:10.346 --> 19:12.265
Come on with it.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.768
That's it, that's it.
That's enough.

19:15.977 --> 19:17.353
I felt a twinge.

19:18.813 --> 19:20.899
Come upstairs.
I'll ice it down for you.

19:21.107 --> 19:23.067
No. I'm going back home.

19:23.276 --> 19:25.236
All right. I'll call you later.

19:25.487 --> 19:26.404
All right.

19:26.654 --> 19:31.075
- Take care of that arm, all right?
- It's just old age.

21:27.363 --> 21:29.616
<i>- Clarke, what time is it?
- One o'clock pm.</i>

21:29.824 --> 21:32.035
<i>- What does that mean?
- You're practising.</i>

21:32.243 --> 21:34.579
That's right.
lt means I'm practicing.

21:34.788 --> 21:38.793
If you know I'm practicing
and I don't finish practicing till 2:00,

21:39.001 --> 21:41.921
which is another 60 minutes,
why you buzzing my buzzer?

21:42.129 --> 21:44.048
<i>Because I want to see you.</i>

21:44.256 --> 21:47.384
<i>- What is that supposed to mean?
- That means let me up.</i>

21:47.593 --> 21:50.513
<i>- And who are you?
- I'm Clarke.</i>

21:52.264 --> 21:54.517
How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:54.725 --> 21:57.520
I have a certain time
allotted for daily practice.

21:57.728 --> 22:01.608
You know this, yet you
consistently overlook my programme.

22:05.070 --> 22:07.614
I get the times mixed up.

22:07.823 --> 22:10.575
Everything with you
is so damn regulated.

22:10.784 --> 22:13.745
A certain time to do this,
a certain time to do that.

22:13.954 --> 22:16.248
Everything's on a schedule, a timetable.

22:16.498 --> 22:20.293
- Loosen up, tight ass.
- Let me explain something to you.

22:20.502 --> 22:22.546
Life is short, OK?

22:22.796 --> 22:26.092
I need it like this
to get everything done. I like order.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.387
Order's fine, but you're ridiculous.

22:31.389 --> 22:32.723
And what do you want?

22:32.974 --> 22:36.644
I want a man
who knows what he wants. Decisive.

22:36.853 --> 22:38.646
You don't know what you want.

22:38.855 --> 22:41.858
Make up your mind to be a man
and don't be wishy-washy on me.

22:44.819 --> 22:47.905
I know what I want. My music.
Everything else is secondary.

22:48.072 --> 22:50.826
- I knew you would say that.
- Then why'd you ask?

22:56.206 --> 23:01.462
Brother,... if your music
is the be all to end all, as you state,

23:01.712 --> 23:05.674
to ensure that you better
get rid of Giant as your manager.

23:05.883 --> 23:08.760
Clarke, stay out of my business, OK?

23:11.221 --> 23:14.434
Are you screwing him, or what?
He's a horrible manager.

23:14.642 --> 23:17.020
Everybody can see that but you.

23:17.228 --> 23:19.439
Why bring this confusion
into my home?

23:19.647 --> 23:21.941
I'm looking out for your best interest.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.860
Oh.

23:24.694 --> 23:25.987
I see.

23:27.238 --> 23:28.406
- Bleek.
- Mm?

23:28.615 --> 23:33.661
I'm not saying I'm a brain surgeon,
but everybody's a teacher.

23:33.870 --> 23:39.293
People can teach you two things,
what to do and what not to do.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.715
Say something.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.302
Let's make love.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.722
For once, let's be real.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.809
What you and I do
is not ''make love''.

23:55.017 --> 23:58.103
- What would you call it?
- It's definitely not making love.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.065
- Boning?
- You've been more imaginative.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.819
- You ever heard of the mo' better?
- Mo' what?

24:04.069 --> 24:06.279
Mo' better makes it mo' better.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.281
Mo' better makes it mo' better.

24:08.490 --> 24:12.244
That's what we do. We don't make love
because you don't love me.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.665
But in the meantime,
I'll settle for some of that mo' better.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.834
Yeah. I knew you would.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.340
Step back.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.177
Open your coat.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.394
Take off your clothes.

25:30.950 --> 25:31.951
Ow!

25:32.202 --> 25:34.954
- I'm sorry.
- You bit my lip.

25:35.205 --> 25:38.249
Oh, shit. ls it bleeding?
What you laughing at?

25:38.458 --> 25:41.169
- I was playing.
- Don't play with my lips.

25:42.963 --> 25:45.800
I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, I said I'm sorry.

25:46.008 --> 25:48.344
Damn, she done cut my...

25:48.594 --> 25:49.845
You're nuts!

25:50.054 --> 25:52.181
Want me to kiss it
to make it mo' better?

25:52.348 --> 25:54.850
This shit ain't funny, man.

25:55.059 --> 25:56.685
I was joking.

25:56.894 --> 25:59.772
All right, I won't ever kiss you again.

25:59.980 --> 26:01.482
That's good.

26:02.608 --> 26:04.276
I make my living with my lips.

26:04.485 --> 26:06.571
I make my living with my lips.

26:10.784 --> 26:13.870
Why don't you clean this place up?
It's filthy.

26:14.121 --> 26:16.248
Cleanliness is next to godliness, right?

26:16.456 --> 26:18.667
This is the last time I carry you.

26:19.709 --> 26:22.504
I want to play the full schedule today.

26:22.712 --> 26:24.798
Start with the National League.

26:25.006 --> 26:27.300
The Pirates play the Mets
in a doubleheader.

26:27.551 --> 26:31.848
Give me the Pirates in both games.
The Mets need more black ballplayers.

26:32.056 --> 26:33.766
Give me the Reds over the 'stros,

26:33.975 --> 26:36.978
Expos over the Phillies,
Braves over the Dodgers,

26:37.145 --> 26:40.523
Cubs over the Cardinals,
the Giants over the Padres.

26:45.444 --> 26:48.156
ln the American League,
the Yankees over the Tigers,

26:48.364 --> 26:50.366
even though Steinbrenner needs to go.

26:50.575 --> 26:53.661
Brewers over the Red Sox,
Orioles over the Jays.

26:53.870 --> 26:55.747
That's my main man, Frank Robinson.

26:55.956 --> 26:57.958
Yucca, barbecue, Oreo cookies.

26:58.208 --> 27:01.086
Indians over the White Sox,
the Twins over the Mariners,

27:01.336 --> 27:03.589
A's over the Royals,
and Angels over Rangers.

27:03.797 --> 27:07.509
<i>Ice cream, tamale, arroz, azucar.
All of that?</i>

27:07.676 --> 27:08.969
All of that.

27:09.178 --> 27:11.513
Give me two C-notes on each game.

27:11.722 --> 27:14.224
- Can you cover that?
- Just make the bet.

27:14.475 --> 27:15.726
Two C-notes on each?

27:15.934 --> 27:19.188
Two C-notes on each game.
I'm coming back, Petey.

27:19.396 --> 27:22.358
It's never over till it's over.

27:22.567 --> 27:25.153
- Will you stop with that?
- I rehearse my luck.

27:25.361 --> 27:27.322
This is my luck.

27:31.326 --> 27:33.369
- What does it look like?
- lt looks good.

27:33.578 --> 27:36.164
The numbers look good.
Numbers never lie.

27:36.372 --> 27:39.918
That's why I like numbers. People
lie from the crib, but not numbers.

27:40.168 --> 27:42.212
Moe, the numbers never lie.

27:42.378 --> 27:45.132
- But human beings?
- Human beings is another story.

27:45.382 --> 27:47.176
You meet some shmendrick.

27:47.384 --> 27:51.222
The guy says ''Yes. No. Maybe''
but you never know, right?

27:51.472 --> 27:53.808
- But not numbers. Three and three?
- Six.

27:54.016 --> 27:57.436
You know what I'm saying?
A guy tells you it's done, right?

27:57.645 --> 28:01.315
But you don't know. He could be
in back doing something to somebody,

28:01.607 --> 28:02.858
and you don't know.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.527
- Seven and seven?
- Fourteen.

28:04.735 --> 28:05.778
- Eight and eight?
- Sixteen.

28:05.986 --> 28:06.987
- Nine and nine?
- Eighteen.

28:07.196 --> 28:11.034
Firm. Concrete.
It's like a solid walk, understand?

28:11.243 --> 28:13.620
That's what a lot of people
don't understand.

28:13.870 --> 28:17.624
They want to give you, you know...
But a number's right there.

28:17.874 --> 28:21.670
- You can see it, right?
- You can't buy trust, right?

28:21.878 --> 28:23.839
I trust my mother sometimes.

28:51.450 --> 28:53.286
Hey! Hey!

28:53.494 --> 28:55.163
Hey, I'm walking here.

28:55.371 --> 28:57.790
I was walking. Fuck your mother!

28:58.040 --> 28:59.126
Your mother!

29:09.219 --> 29:10.554
Whoa! Whoa!

29:10.762 --> 29:14.224
Money, back it on up.
No midgets getting in tonight.

29:14.475 --> 29:17.478
I'm sorry.
You know my name is Giant.

29:17.686 --> 29:21.064
- Every night we go over this.
- All right then, no giants allowed.

29:21.273 --> 29:24.569
Come off the giant tip.
You're not a giant.

29:24.777 --> 29:28.531
- Go home and take a nap.
- When are you gonna let the people in?

29:28.781 --> 29:31.826
Lines are good for business,
which you know nothing about.

29:32.035 --> 29:35.955
- ls that Moe and Josh talking?
- Black men can't have a smart thought?

29:36.164 --> 29:39.250
- No, because you're stupid.
- Why is it always the white man?

29:39.417 --> 29:40.710
The black man is God.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.671
I'm sick and tired
of your Five Percenter malarkey.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.216
It's not Five Percenter.
It's Five Percent.

29:46.424 --> 29:47.675
Five percent of what?

29:47.884 --> 29:50.679
Five percent of the population
knows what's going on,

29:50.888 --> 29:54.391
the gods of this planet, the original
Asiatic black man from Africa

29:54.600 --> 29:57.520
with knowledge of self,
sent here to teach the 85%

29:57.728 --> 29:59.563
that you're dumb, deaf, and blind.

29:59.730 --> 30:02.525
You're being exploited
by the devilish ten percent.

30:02.733 --> 30:05.194
- Don't cut my wisdom!
- You're talking garbage!

30:05.402 --> 30:08.322
Acknowledge it! People should've
been in long time ago.

30:08.572 --> 30:12.201
Don't be looking at your Timex.
The people get in when I want them to.

30:12.409 --> 30:14.913
- And when is that?
- Whoa, whoa!

30:15.121 --> 30:17.624
The time is when, God. Lounge.

30:19.459 --> 30:23.630
The both of you can kiss
my narrow black butt... two times.

30:23.839 --> 30:25.465
Twice.

30:25.674 --> 30:27.676
Kiss your narrow black butt two times?

30:27.884 --> 30:32.305
What if I kick you on your flat back
once and watch you grow a butt?

30:32.514 --> 30:33.515
Relax, man.

30:33.723 --> 30:37.728
You ain't got no butt. You just got
two legs sticking out your shoulders.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.523
Lounge, man. Go in peace, my brother.

30:40.731 --> 30:44.026
- One day you'll be righteous.
- You look like a Slim Jim in a suit.

30:44.235 --> 30:45.611
Lounge, man.

30:45.820 --> 30:48.948
That's what the devil wants,
us fighting each other.

30:49.157 --> 30:51.325
- Where's Left?
- Late again.

30:52.451 --> 30:56.455
- B, every day it's like this.
- Yeah, I know, I warned him.

30:56.706 --> 30:59.417
- We have to talk to this guy.
- I talked to him earlier.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.752
- When?
- I'll bet he's with Jeanne.

31:02.004 --> 31:04.631
That's a sucker's bet.

31:10.012 --> 31:13.390
- Take off, shit.
- Sorry I'm late.

31:13.599 --> 31:16.185
You cannot find cab
in New York City.

31:23.525 --> 31:25.360
Left, you're late again.

31:25.569 --> 31:27.572
We said we're sorry, OK?

31:31.367 --> 31:33.703
- All right, all right.
- OK, OK.

31:33.912 --> 31:34.996
What did I miss?

31:35.205 --> 31:38.750
<i>If your late sorry ass would've
been here, you'd have missed nada.</i>

31:38.958 --> 31:42.378
- We're about to go over the numbers.
- Then I didn't miss anything.

31:42.545 --> 31:45.590
- Damn.
- What's the matter with that brother?

31:47.300 --> 31:49.761
Jeanne,
could you excuse us, please?

31:50.011 --> 31:52.765
Just one minute.
I'll be finished, just one minute.

31:53.015 --> 31:56.101
- Tighten this up up here.
- OK, OK.

31:56.769 --> 32:00.564
- Could you excuse us, please?
- Just a minute. I'm finishing.

32:00.773 --> 32:02.900
What is wrong with that brother?

32:03.901 --> 32:06.529
Left, get her the fuck out of here!
Let's go!

32:09.031 --> 32:10.074
Jeanne.

32:12.743 --> 32:14.495
I'm going to be down front.

32:18.875 --> 32:21.086
English. Speak English.

32:21.253 --> 32:24.631
Bullshit accent. She's from Queens.

32:24.881 --> 32:28.718
The wrong key, Left. The wrong key
bringing your lady in here.

32:28.969 --> 32:31.638
- Let it go.
- Why are you so hard on my lady?

32:31.847 --> 32:32.848
Why?

32:33.098 --> 32:34.891
Your lady's been fucking up.

32:35.142 --> 32:38.478
Nobody's allowed back here,
especially when we're about to hit.

32:38.687 --> 32:41.607
Everybody else's woman
respects that shit except her.

32:41.816 --> 32:44.610
- No, no. It's because she's white.
- Cos she's white?

32:44.777 --> 32:45.778
- Yes.
- Come on.

32:45.987 --> 32:47.905
That's why you all dog her.

32:48.114 --> 32:51.325
- Get a grip, Left.
- You remind me of my brother.

32:51.576 --> 32:53.703
He was an Archie comic book freak.

32:53.911 --> 32:55.621
That's where all his money went.

32:55.830 --> 32:58.958
- Yeah, he looks like Jughead.
- ls this a long story?

32:59.167 --> 33:00.751
Shut up and listen.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.130
They had these pinups
of Betty and Veronica in a bathing suit.

33:04.338 --> 33:07.885
One day, he tore them out,
Scotch taped them to the wall.

33:08.051 --> 33:10.220
- And?
- And my moms walked in.

33:10.429 --> 33:13.015
She saw red.
I knew there was going to be trouble.

33:13.182 --> 33:15.559
I said, ''Mommy, get Larry,
it was his idea.''

33:15.767 --> 33:19.146
''If I ever...'' Whack. ''...see any
white women...'' Whack, whack.

33:19.313 --> 33:22.399
''...on my walls again, in my house,
I'll kill you.''

33:22.608 --> 33:26.570
I started to cry, ''Mommy,
don't kill him. That's my only brother.''

33:26.778 --> 33:30.116
- ''He loves Betty and Veronica.''
- And the moral of the story is?

33:31.242 --> 33:36.039
There is no moral to the story. Keep
that croosant-eating heifer out of here.

33:36.247 --> 33:41.211
It's croissant. And show some respect.
Don't disrespect her like that.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.463
She's good to me,
so have some respect.

33:43.713 --> 33:47.050
- You show some respect.
- Respect the dressing room.

33:47.258 --> 33:50.261
- Yeah, man, respect yourself.
- Do right, Left.

33:50.470 --> 33:52.305
- You're jealous.
- Jealous?

33:52.514 --> 33:55.351
Couldn't pull a French girl.
She's an educated woman.

33:55.559 --> 33:58.229
She went to the Sorbonne.
You don't know where it is.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.940
- Sore buns?
- You can get it on 125th Street.

34:03.734 --> 34:05.110
She's a sister, you know.

34:05.319 --> 34:10.407
- Oh! She's a sister?
- Sister? What kind of sister?

34:10.616 --> 34:14.411
- She's a nun.
- She's Joan of Arc's sister.

34:14.620 --> 34:18.456
- Ignorant. You're ignorant black men.
- I got a Chinese girl.

34:18.666 --> 34:21.837
- She can cook, too.
- You guys are just jealous.

34:22.045 --> 34:23.045
Jealous?

34:23.255 --> 34:26.216
Do I talk about your women?
The women up on that wall?

34:26.424 --> 34:28.467
Them women over there?

34:28.717 --> 34:30.637
That's a sister.

34:32.222 --> 34:36.268
And they go on a wall, right?
This is my sister right here.

34:36.476 --> 34:39.938
Here, man, a real woman.
You make a choice.

34:42.732 --> 34:45.652
That's cold. That's cold.

34:47.612 --> 34:50.241
Don't be throwing the sisters around.

34:50.449 --> 34:53.034
You guys are absolutely disgusting.

34:53.286 --> 34:55.036
Take that shit off my mirror!

34:55.288 --> 34:57.957
- Respect the black woman.
- No, you respect my space.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.626
- This is the queen.
- This is my space.

35:00.835 --> 35:02.628
You take the queen.

35:02.837 --> 35:06.007
The bottom line is you were late.
You brought your lady in here.

35:06.215 --> 35:09.428
Don't do that anymore.
Everybody knows the rules.

35:09.678 --> 35:11.388
Left, you're fucking up.

35:15.350 --> 35:17.644
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:17.895 --> 35:21.023
Moe and Josh Flatbush
and Beneath The Underdog

35:21.231 --> 35:24.526
proudly present
for your listening enjoyment

35:24.735 --> 35:27.905
the Bleek Quintet.

35:38.958 --> 35:40.126
Thank you.

35:44.297 --> 35:45.298
Thank you.

35:45.548 --> 35:46.841
Did you see them lines?

35:47.050 --> 35:48.718
- We got eyes.
- We got ears.

35:48.927 --> 35:51.137
Bleek has consistently packed the joint.

35:51.346 --> 35:53.640
- We're pleased.
- We're more than pleased.

35:53.848 --> 35:55.350
- We're ecstatic.
- Fabulous.

35:55.558 --> 35:59.146
We want more money. You're making
a killing. What's fair is fair.

35:59.355 --> 36:01.607
No. What we're
paying you now is fair,

36:01.857 --> 36:04.068
and it's what you agreed upon.

36:04.235 --> 36:07.071
You want to take food
out of our kids' mouths?

36:07.238 --> 36:10.115
- If we had it, we'd give it to you.
- But we don't have it.

36:10.324 --> 36:13.369
- Ever heard of the word renegotiate?
- Out of the question.

36:13.577 --> 36:18.749
$15 cover charge, three-drink minimum,
dinner starts at $25.

36:18.958 --> 36:21.544
You guys are making money
hand over fingers.

36:21.753 --> 36:24.881
- What about the artist?
- Don't hand me that artist doo-doo.

36:25.090 --> 36:29.845
They don't have any financial risks.
Go listen to the music, huh?

36:30.053 --> 36:32.764
- You think Bleek's Elvis?
- There's only one Elvis.

36:32.973 --> 36:36.393
- There's only one king in music.
- And that starts with an ''E''.

36:36.601 --> 36:39.604
Come on. Go shoot some hoops.
Gimme some moves, huh?

36:39.813 --> 36:41.815
Let me eat my sushi.

36:51.534 --> 36:53.244
Black queen.

36:53.452 --> 36:57.498
I mean, my slice of pie.
The apple of my eye.

36:57.707 --> 37:00.293
My chicken thigh, extra spicy.

37:00.501 --> 37:01.836
Ham, Spam.

37:02.044 --> 37:05.381
Eggs and bacon, chicken and waffles.
From Wilsons.

37:05.590 --> 37:08.009
How you doing, baby?
You're looking good to me.

37:08.217 --> 37:10.845
- What happened to you, Bleek?
- What happened to me?

37:11.054 --> 37:14.308
- I've been waiting for twenty years.
- Twenty...

37:14.558 --> 37:18.896
My watch must be going slow,
lt says 15 years, but I'll get it fixed.

37:19.104 --> 37:23.817
Baby, you should have been
down the club. We was kicking butt.

37:24.026 --> 37:27.529
- Good. I'm glad it went well.
- I wish you were there.

37:27.696 --> 37:31.325
- You know how I feel about clubs.
- No. How do you feel?

37:31.533 --> 37:33.285
All that smoke!

37:33.494 --> 37:36.831
I'd rather sit at home
and listen to your records.

37:37.081 --> 37:40.585
I mean, bothering with all them people,
it's not my thing.

37:40.793 --> 37:43.213
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

37:43.421 --> 37:45.965
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

37:46.174 --> 37:50.470
Be specific? What am I saying?
I'm saying that I love your music,

37:50.678 --> 37:53.223
but I don't like
sitting up in some club.

37:53.473 --> 37:56.559
That's all you're saying?
You're not upset cos I'm late?

37:56.768 --> 37:59.729
- No. That's something different.
- I see.

37:59.938 --> 38:02.942
Shall we go upstairs?
Want to talk about it upstairs?

38:03.150 --> 38:06.445
- We might, could.
- We might, could? Oh!

38:06.654 --> 38:09.365
- Now. I'm not waiting anymore.
- We might, could.

38:09.532 --> 38:14.286
I used to coulda, woulda, shoulda.
That sounds like a good song.

38:16.038 --> 38:19.500
What would you do, Bleek,
if you couldn't play anymore?

38:23.420 --> 38:25.924
Probably roll up in a corner and die.

38:28.301 --> 38:30.136
I'd play at my own funeral, though.

38:42.315 --> 38:44.276
I want to bite your neck.

38:44.484 --> 38:45.610
No!

38:45.861 --> 38:47.195
The other side.

38:47.404 --> 38:49.657
- No!
- The other side.

38:49.907 --> 38:51.868
The middle.

38:52.076 --> 38:53.077
The lips.

38:53.244 --> 38:57.123
Yes, the lips.

38:57.290 --> 38:59.834
There's more blood in the lips.

39:00.710 --> 39:02.753
- Don't be afraid.
- No!

39:25.110 --> 39:27.446
- Giant.
- Son of a bitch.

39:27.696 --> 39:29.615
Giant.

39:30.240 --> 39:33.494
Seen the paper?

39:35.078 --> 39:36.538
I can read.

39:36.747 --> 39:38.958
Can you count?
Cos you owe me.

39:39.167 --> 39:42.420
- You know I'm good for it.
- You're way over as it is.

39:42.629 --> 39:46.090
- Are you going to carry me or what?
- You're going to give me a hernia.

39:46.299 --> 39:48.259
My man, I feel good about this one.

39:49.719 --> 39:51.387
- Shoot.
- Come on, let's go.

39:51.596 --> 39:56.851
Mets, Cards, Astros, Phillies, Dodgers
and the Padres.

40:00.355 --> 40:02.649
The full menu. How much?

40:02.857 --> 40:04.735
500 on each game.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.863
You're grown up. You're a big boy.

40:08.072 --> 40:12.034
- That's what they say.
- I swear on my mother...

40:14.328 --> 40:17.039
<i>No mas. No more. No mas.</i>

40:18.457 --> 40:19.458
Roberto Duran.

40:19.667 --> 40:26.131
<i>Roberto, si.
Giant, no mas. No more. No mas.</i>

40:28.426 --> 40:32.055
I talked to Moe and Josh.
We're going to get our money.

40:32.305 --> 40:35.183
-  I'm working hard.
- Stay on top of that.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.020
Look, why don't you
run this to Shadow's crib?

40:39.229 --> 40:42.107
It's a serious piece. I borrowed it.

40:43.900 --> 40:44.901
He'll get it.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.987
It's about time.

40:47.195 --> 40:51.449
Bleek borrowed this a year ago.
This is a rare, out-of-print Bird.

40:51.700 --> 40:55.663
Just stand there, brother. Better not
be no scratches on here, either.

40:58.207 --> 40:59.333
Lucky.

40:59.542 --> 41:03.087
Tell your bitch don't ask for nothing
if it takes a year to return it.

41:03.296 --> 41:05.214
I don't want to hear that bitch stuff.

41:05.423 --> 41:08.801
Look, I'm a delivery man.
Any static, take it up with Bleek.

41:09.051 --> 41:10.511
I'm spacing.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.514
No, no, no, hold on.

41:13.681 --> 41:17.561
- Er... I need your help.
- How long is it going to take?

41:17.769 --> 41:19.188
Hey, no time.

41:19.438 --> 41:22.065
- Should I change the sheets?
- They need changing.

41:22.274 --> 41:25.569
No, see,
I was blending this honey in here.

41:25.777 --> 41:29.198
So I don't want my lady to catch me.

41:29.406 --> 41:32.451
- You smell perfume, man?
- Shadow, you've lost your mind.

41:32.701 --> 41:34.077
No, do you smell perfume?

41:35.370 --> 41:37.039
No.

41:37.247 --> 41:39.208
Smell the sheets, man!

41:40.459 --> 41:42.378
Smells all right to me.

41:44.047 --> 41:47.425
I don't know why
I'm asking you anyway, man.

41:47.634 --> 41:49.802
She has a highly developed
sense of smell.

41:50.053 --> 41:51.971
She could sniff me out five miles away.

41:52.222 --> 41:55.016
I think she must be
part canine and shit.

41:56.684 --> 41:59.479
Yo, you know what?
She counts my rubbers, man.

41:59.646 --> 42:00.647
- No.
- Yes.

42:00.855 --> 42:03.191
The woman was an accountant major
in school.

42:03.441 --> 42:05.735
So she takes an accurate account
of my jimmys.

42:05.944 --> 42:10.241
Now I got to go buy a whole nother box
so she won't bust me again.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.619
One time I rid around the city, man,

42:13.828 --> 42:19.333
and I searched for a box
of 12 dozen blue Trojans, ribbed,

42:19.542 --> 42:24.630
with the receptacle end, lubricated
with the garden-fresh scent.

42:26.048 --> 42:28.217
Daggone girl knows everything.

42:33.306 --> 42:35.600
Why bother?

42:35.809 --> 42:37.602
Why bother?

42:37.811 --> 42:41.314
Well, I like her, number one.

42:41.523 --> 42:44.985
Number two...
she's a mother in bed.

42:45.193 --> 42:49.489
- Mm-hm.
- Number three, the rest don't matter.

42:49.698 --> 42:50.740
Three good reasons.

42:52.033 --> 42:53.201
Roll over.

42:53.410 --> 42:55.328
- Yes, baby.
- No, the other way.

42:55.580 --> 42:57.874
Yes,... baby.

43:08.467 --> 43:11.012
- Ow! Baby.
- That was a good one.

43:11.220 --> 43:13.055
- Damn, that hurt.
- Be still.

43:13.264 --> 43:16.017
All right. Be careful.

43:16.225 --> 43:20.355
- How are your singing lessons?
- Good. I think I'm ready.

43:21.273 --> 43:22.774
You think you're ready?

43:22.941 --> 43:27.029
Ready to accompany the band
for a song at the Dog.

43:28.030 --> 43:29.990
You think I'm not ready?

43:31.116 --> 43:33.368
Wait, look, baby, erm...

43:33.619 --> 43:37.289
just cos we're seeing each other
it's nothing to do with the music.

43:37.539 --> 43:39.708
Now, I think that...

43:39.917 --> 43:42.920
I think you got potential,
but it takes years, not months.

43:43.128 --> 43:45.924
- Thanks for nothing.
- I'm not trying to be cruel.

43:46.132 --> 43:48.635
If we were married,
I'd say the same thing.

43:48.885 --> 43:49.886
- Look...
- Ow!

43:50.094 --> 43:54.140
I'm not asking you
or anybody else for any handouts.

43:54.349 --> 43:57.393
Everybody needs a break.
I thought you might be the person.

43:57.602 --> 44:01.439
Shoot me, I was wrong.
Pop your own bumps.

44:05.985 --> 44:08.446
You know, a lot of people
say I'm a good singer.

44:08.655 --> 44:11.408
Good. Go sing with them.

44:11.617 --> 44:13.786
Forget you. I believe in myself.

44:13.994 --> 44:16.705
You're supposed to believe in yourself.

44:16.914 --> 44:20.960
- Shadow says I can sing.
- Oh, ''Shadow says I can sing.''

44:21.126 --> 44:23.170
What else does Shadow say?

44:50.448 --> 44:51.700
A-minor seventh.

44:52.325 --> 44:54.661
A-minor seventh. That'll work.

44:59.250 --> 45:00.251
Seventh.

45:02.628 --> 45:04.589
B13# eleven.

45:06.174 --> 45:08.301
No, that's not right.

45:25.194 --> 45:27.196
- Does it tickle?
- Yeah.

45:31.033 --> 45:35.370
- That's not right.
- Let me leave the artist at work alone.

45:35.579 --> 45:39.291
The muse is visiting him.
Bleek is truly inspired.

45:39.541 --> 45:43.295
Then he will share
his new, latest gift to the world.

45:43.504 --> 45:45.547
- Hallelujah.

46:00.647 --> 46:03.942
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

46:04.150 --> 46:07.862
this is something
that came in last night.

46:08.112 --> 46:11.407
- Shadow. Bottom.
- I had my hand on the panties.

46:11.616 --> 46:13.410
On the panties.

46:13.619 --> 46:16.372
Drums, drums. Jones.

46:16.580 --> 46:20.417
''Pop, Top 40, R&B,
Urban Contemporary,

46:20.626 --> 46:23.420
Easy Listening, Funk Love.''

46:23.629 --> 46:25.339
Damn, you for real?

46:25.589 --> 46:27.550
This shit is out.

46:34.139 --> 46:37.769
Now, hold up.
Let's talk about the money.

46:37.978 --> 46:39.896
What about the money, Shadow?

46:40.105 --> 46:42.315
What about the money?!

46:42.524 --> 46:46.736
- We want more.
- You're the spokesperson for everyone?

46:46.987 --> 46:47.988
Yeah.

46:48.196 --> 46:50.866
Even for Left Hand, who's late again?

46:51.116 --> 46:55.537
Look, the point of the matter is we've
been packing them in at the Dog, right?

46:55.745 --> 47:00.876
Moe, Josh and Bleek
have been bringing in cash dollars.

47:01.084 --> 47:04.630
- Where's our raise?
- You promised.

47:04.839 --> 47:06.799
It's long overdue.

47:07.508 --> 47:10.761
- I'm talking to them.
- He's working on it.

47:13.598 --> 47:16.225
Yeah, well,
maybe we need new management,

47:16.434 --> 47:19.145
somebody who can get
the terms we want.

47:19.353 --> 47:21.355
You need to get your ears cleaned.

47:21.564 --> 47:23.566
You don't understand.
This is my band.

47:23.774 --> 47:27.946
Read the marquee. lt says the Bleek,
two ''E''s, one ''K'', Quintet.

47:28.155 --> 47:31.366
When you're running things,
you can do whatever you want.

47:31.575 --> 47:33.243
lt won't be long from now.

47:33.410 --> 47:36.663
lt won't be long, but until
that magical, mystical day happens,

47:36.872 --> 47:38.832
you do what the hell I say.

47:40.334 --> 47:42.294
The midget should go, Bleek.

47:42.503 --> 47:44.463
Fine. You manage then.

47:45.714 --> 47:49.843
That's not my job. You're supposed to be
taking care of me.

47:50.052 --> 47:53.056
I'm the artist, midget rat bastard.

47:56.851 --> 47:58.853
What does size have to do with it?

48:00.021 --> 48:02.106
A lot.

48:02.315 --> 48:04.817
You keep coming up short.

48:07.195 --> 48:10.490
- Don't shove me.
- Keep coming up short.

48:13.701 --> 48:15.871
Sorry I'm late.

48:16.121 --> 48:19.625
One more time, you're about 2.2 seconds
from the unemployment line.

48:19.834 --> 48:21.752
I'm sorry. I won't be late again.

48:21.961 --> 48:24.463
A lot of piano players
want your gig, a lot.

48:24.672 --> 48:27.967
Sorry. New tune.

48:28.175 --> 48:30.135
It's a nice title.

48:33.597 --> 48:36.350
All right, let's walk through this.

48:42.357 --> 48:44.985
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

48:45.193 --> 48:49.990
as I travel through this great big
country of ours, this US of A,

48:50.198 --> 48:54.578
and being on the road as much as I do,
I listen to a lot of radio stations.

48:54.786 --> 48:58.957
It's amazing how many KlSS
or V103 stations there are.

48:59.207 --> 49:02.544
Jesus Christ, did people
run out of call letters, or what?

49:03.420 --> 49:05.089
Come on.

49:05.339 --> 49:09.510
Anyway, most of the stuff
on the radio is so sad. It's a drag.

49:09.719 --> 49:12.889
One of the reasons could be
because every song is about...

49:13.097 --> 49:16.184
Oh, you guessed it, huh? Love.

49:16.392 --> 49:17.685
Love.

49:17.894 --> 49:19.270
Love.

49:19.478 --> 49:22.064
L-O-V-E.

49:22.315 --> 49:26.736
<i>What the world needs now...</i>

49:28.487 --> 49:30.449
is not another love song.

49:32.534 --> 49:34.494
Now, dig. Check this out.

49:34.661 --> 49:38.457
The love that's professed in these songs
is shaky anyway.

49:38.624 --> 49:42.377
It's a lustful, selfish,
end-of-the-world love.

49:42.586 --> 49:44.004
And the lyrics...

49:44.254 --> 49:46.965
Have you tried to listen to the lyrics?

49:47.216 --> 49:49.176
You heard them all before.

49:55.683 --> 49:57.727
<i>My love ls higher
Fire and desire</i>

49:57.936 --> 49:59.812
<i>Let's stay together forever</i>

50:00.021 --> 50:01.814
<i>Despite all types of weather</i>

50:02.023 --> 50:03.608
<i>Even a hurricane</i>

50:03.816 --> 50:07.070
<i>ln fact,
I'd spend a winter ln Chi town</i>

50:09.614 --> 50:11.199
<i>And you know that's cold</i>

50:11.407 --> 50:13.826
<i>Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no river wide enough</i>

50:14.035 --> 50:16.162
<i>To keep me from gettln'
to your good stuff</i>

50:16.371 --> 50:17.539
<i>You know It's rough</i>

50:28.467 --> 50:30.761
Racist?

50:30.970 --> 50:32.972
Giant's not a racist.

50:33.180 --> 50:34.682
Giant ain't no racist.

50:34.890 --> 50:36.517
<i>What a dope
like soap on a rope</i>

50:36.684 --> 50:38.894
<i>I went for the okey doke
You know this ls true</i>

50:39.103 --> 50:42.439
<i>He blew L-O-V-E, try S-E-X</i>

50:42.690 --> 50:45.026
<i>I'll be a happy chappy
Also nappy</i>

50:45.235 --> 50:47.195
<i>l get the shivers down to my livers</i>

50:49.573 --> 50:53.118
Other guys just feed you lines,
but l take you to Mickey D's.

50:57.163 --> 50:59.916
<i>Baby, I'm on my knees
Please, baby, please</i>

51:00.083 --> 51:02.210
<i>But this ain't that song
It's gettin' long</i>

51:02.419 --> 51:04.129
<i>My nature ls rlsln' to the horizon</i>

51:04.337 --> 51:06.631
<i>It's strong as an ox
Like a Clorox box</i>

51:06.840 --> 51:09.218
<i>You're a bad mama jama</i>

51:12.305 --> 51:15.641
<i>But you already know that
Just point me ln the right direction</i>

51:15.850 --> 51:17.727
<i>Only you give me
that serious connection</i>

51:17.935 --> 51:20.438
<i>Get out of my dreams</i>

51:20.646 --> 51:24.150
Hey, midget. Petey's on the phone.

51:32.492 --> 51:34.453
Thanks.

51:41.084 --> 51:44.046
l know. l know. l know.

51:44.254 --> 51:46.215
l can read. l went to school.

52:17.664 --> 52:19.874
<i>lt came as a surprise
You opened my eyes</i>

52:20.083 --> 52:22.002
<i>Why? Because l love you</i>

52:22.211 --> 52:25.464
<i>Let me spend
the rest of my life with you, tonight</i>

52:25.631 --> 52:29.593
<i>If you don't, I'll just roll up
into a ball and just die</i>

52:29.802 --> 52:32.596
<i>- l know how you feel.
-  Won't wash, won't eat</i>

52:32.805 --> 52:35.140
<i>Won't even go to work
If you don't love me do</i>

52:35.349 --> 52:38.227
<i>I'll even give up
my four season tickets</i>

52:38.435 --> 52:41.146
<i>To the New York Knicks, courtside</i>

52:46.152 --> 52:48.238
<i>And you know
How l feel about basketball</i>

52:48.488 --> 52:50.574
<i>That's got to be L-O-V-E</i>

52:50.782 --> 52:53.326
<i>Let me call you my own
Shower me with your cones</i>

52:53.577 --> 52:56.079
<i>Let lt rain down on me like a monsoon</i>

52:56.288 --> 52:58.248
<i>Let your love come down, flow down</i>

52:58.456 --> 53:02.669
<i>Drown me ln that stuff
l want to swim ln lt, do 20 laps</i>

53:02.919 --> 53:05.630
<i>The breast stroke ls my specialty</i>

<i>L-O-V-E</i>

53:09.342 --> 53:11.679
<i>L-O-V-E</i>

53:12.597 --> 53:17.560
<i>L-O-V-E</i>

53:21.314 --> 53:23.274
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hey, babe.

53:26.819 --> 53:29.238
<i>- Peace.
- Assalamualaikum, brother.</i>

53:33.743 --> 53:36.580
l said, ''I'm going to kill you.''
l was going to kill him.

53:36.788 --> 53:40.000
l had him up right against...
Bleeky, hey.

53:40.209 --> 53:44.213
Sit down. We've been meaning
to talk to you. Join us.

53:44.421 --> 53:47.132
- Our meat-and-potatoes man.
- Bread and butter.

53:47.341 --> 53:50.177
- I'm not talking corned beef.
- Prime ribs.

53:50.385 --> 53:52.971
- You want a cigar?
- l don't want a cigar.

53:53.180 --> 53:56.916
l don't want any meat and potatoes, either.
l want more money.

53:57.051 --> 54:00.030
I'm not happy.
When I'm not happy, l don't play good.

54:00.231 --> 54:03.200
When l don't play good,
the music doesn't sound good.

54:03.435 --> 54:07.737
If the music doesn't sound good,
nobody comes. We all lose our money.

54:07.946 --> 54:10.365
We want you to be happy.
You're a great talent.

54:10.532 --> 54:14.160
But you got a lot of dead weight
around your neck dragging you down.

54:14.369 --> 54:19.040
And this so-called manager of yours,
Giant, that's a joke.

54:19.249 --> 54:21.376
He couldn't manage a Little League team.

54:21.626 --> 54:24.588
When you're ready for
some real management, come see us.

54:24.797 --> 54:26.882
My first cousin, he's top shelf.

54:27.091 --> 54:30.427
- He's short, but he's smart.
- We love the guy.

54:30.636 --> 54:34.682
He handles only the best, first class
all the way, just like Josh and me.

54:34.890 --> 54:37.726
- Filet mignon.
- Dom Perignon. First class.

54:37.935 --> 54:41.689
I'm here to talk
about the great sums of money

54:41.897 --> 54:45.651
that you two are making off my music
and the little l see in return.

54:45.860 --> 54:48.529
You're talking about management.

54:48.737 --> 54:53.410
Giant, your manager, negotiated
this deal, the one you agreed to.

54:53.618 --> 54:58.957
It's always been our business policy
to never, ever renegotiate the deal.

55:00.876 --> 55:03.169
Look, Giant is my friend, OK?

55:03.378 --> 55:05.463
We all need close friends.

55:05.714 --> 55:07.591
But this is business.

55:07.841 --> 55:10.802
l trust him, which is more
than l can say for your cousin...

55:11.011 --> 55:14.140
Nobody can be trusted.

55:14.348 --> 55:16.767
Everyone steals. Everyone is crooked.

55:17.018 --> 55:19.937
You walk out with as much
of your shirt on as possible.

55:20.188 --> 55:22.899
- You know what this sounds like?
- We like you.

55:23.149 --> 55:27.069
- That's a good thing.
- We have a binding contract.

55:27.320 --> 55:30.531
This is real life.
Think about what we said.

55:30.740 --> 55:34.452
- l been thinking about it.
- Sometimes you got to expand.

55:34.660 --> 55:36.954
To a bigger club? Dizzy's maybe?

55:37.163 --> 55:39.082
You have one of these?

55:39.291 --> 55:42.836
If you break that, I'll sue your ass,
and you'll be out a lot of money.

55:43.045 --> 55:46.423
Get the fuck out of here.
That was a joke, but l would sue you.

55:56.725 --> 56:01.104
They got all kind of people
in this club. l ain't going to lie.

56:01.313 --> 56:05.485
Look at that little ugly guy at the bar.
Hey, fella!

56:05.693 --> 56:08.530
That's Bleek Gilliam's manager.

56:08.738 --> 56:11.574
Little Mr Magoo-looking fucker there.

56:13.743 --> 56:17.038
You think l didn't see you
back over there.

56:17.247 --> 56:22.377
Trying to sneak in here in the coloured
section. l see you sitting at the bar.

56:22.627 --> 56:25.588
Yeah, that poor fucker.

56:25.797 --> 56:29.843
l first met him trying out
for the Celtics a couple of years ago.

56:30.052 --> 56:32.304
He got mad cos Robert Parish
was on the team.

56:32.513 --> 56:35.975
That Larry Bird told me. He ain't
got nothing but a three-pointer.

56:36.183 --> 56:38.519
That's all he needs.

56:40.604 --> 56:43.399
Man walked in the doctor's office
just stuttering.

56:43.607 --> 56:46.944
''Doc, g-g-got to help me.
My wife says she's going to leave me.''

56:47.194 --> 56:50.573
''l-l-I'm stuttering l-l-l-like a goof.''

56:50.781 --> 56:54.494
Doc says, ''Damn, l can barely stand
to hear you talk myself.''

56:54.703 --> 56:57.539
''Go in the examination room
and pull off your clothes.''

56:57.747 --> 57:00.083
''Let me see what's wrong with you.''

57:00.292 --> 57:03.795
The doctor went in the examination room,
looks between his legs,

57:04.004 --> 57:07.090
says, ''My God.
No wonder you can't talk.''

57:07.299 --> 57:10.635
''All that is pulling
on your vocal cords.''

57:10.844 --> 57:15.015
''Put some of that on the table.
Let me chop it off for you.''

57:15.223 --> 57:17.977
The doc went whack.
He says, ''Speak.''

57:18.186 --> 57:20.938
''Thank you, Doctor.''

57:21.147 --> 57:24.066
''My wife is going to love me.
l sure appreciate this.''

57:24.275 --> 57:27.945
Doc said, ''Damn, I'd appreciate it, too,
if you'd pay the bill.''

57:28.196 --> 57:32.950
''Come back in a couple of weeks.
Let me see how you're doing.''

57:33.201 --> 57:35.203
Indigo, does Bleek know you're here?

57:35.411 --> 57:39.749
- No. He has no idea.
- Are you sure?

57:39.957 --> 57:42.628
I'm just gonna make sure.

57:42.836 --> 57:45.911
"...Can you sew it back on?"

57:46.039 --> 57:48.617
And the doctor says,
"T-t-too late, man!"

57:49.927 --> 57:52.638
- What you listening to, man?
- What?

57:52.846 --> 57:55.432
- This is my brother's tape.
- Bleek.

57:55.682 --> 57:59.353
- This stuff is sad, man.
- Can l see you for a second?

58:01.188 --> 58:03.148
He's playing all the instruments.

58:06.194 --> 58:07.445
What's up?

58:07.654 --> 58:09.906
Indigo and Clarke just walked in.

58:10.156 --> 58:13.368
- Yeah? All right, bet.
- Remember that bet?

58:13.576 --> 58:15.537
- What bet?
- We were in Paris.

58:15.745 --> 58:19.541
l urged you not to buy them
the same dress.

58:19.749 --> 58:21.918
You said it was a million-to-one shot

58:22.126 --> 58:26.965
they wear the same dress on the same day
and see each other.

58:28.633 --> 58:33.138
Want to bet again?
You owe me fiddy dollars. Fiddy.

58:33.347 --> 58:35.391
Yeah. Yeah, that's er...

58:36.892 --> 58:39.353
That's good looking-out, G-man.

58:39.562 --> 58:43.607
That's what good managers are for.

58:43.858 --> 58:47.945
- What are you going to do?
- Er...

58:48.153 --> 58:51.365
- What? I'm going to handle this.
- This is a rough one.

58:51.574 --> 58:54.368
- l got it.
- The roughest of the roughest.

58:54.535 --> 58:57.747
- Watch me work.
- I'll be watching.

58:57.956 --> 58:59.541
I'll watch this one.

58:59.749 --> 59:03.670
How you doing, waitress?
She's a nun.

59:03.879 --> 59:06.464
Won't give me none, ain't had none,

59:06.673 --> 59:08.675
told me she didn't need none.

59:10.969 --> 59:15.807
I'm looking for a woman. I'm horny
enough to fuck the crack of dawn.

59:16.016 --> 59:18.310
That's right. l don't lie.

59:19.853 --> 59:22.857
Right. There's some
good-looking women in here

59:23.065 --> 59:25.443
and some good-looking fellas.

59:25.651 --> 59:27.612
How you doing, sir?

59:28.779 --> 59:32.283
I'm a trisexual.
I'll try your little ass tonight.

59:33.326 --> 59:36.037
- You're so nasty.
- Hey, girl, what's happening?

59:36.245 --> 59:38.414
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Enjoy.

59:38.623 --> 59:40.583
- Thanks.
- OK.

59:44.128 --> 59:48.467
My, my, my. What a pleasant surprise.

59:48.675 --> 59:50.636
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:52.137 --> 59:55.682
l been meaning to ask you something.

59:55.891 --> 59:58.435
- What do you see in Bleek?
- What?

59:58.685 --> 01:00:00.604
l don't know what you see in him.

01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:03.357
He's an all right cat, but...

01:00:07.611 --> 01:00:09.906
- What about you?
- What about me?

01:00:10.114 --> 01:00:12.116
What about your career?

01:00:12.325 --> 01:00:14.786
You should be upstage.

01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:17.330
Yeah, l agree.

01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:23.044
If you can't get it here,
you better call your cousin.

01:00:23.294 --> 01:00:27.006
''l didn't come.''
Well, you should've called.

01:00:31.219 --> 01:00:37.560
I'm from Mississippi, and l love it.
l like being country. l ain't lying.

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:40.396
Ain't nothing like a good country lady.

01:00:40.646 --> 01:00:44.191
Girl the other day, l was messing around
with her breast. She got hot.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.362
She said, ''Wouldn't you like something
to go with this breast milk?''

01:00:48.571 --> 01:00:52.074
l said, ''A good piece of cornbread
would go just fine.''

01:00:55.494 --> 01:00:57.997
l like being from the country.

01:00:59.124 --> 01:01:03.962
Ain't nothing wrong
with being from the country.

01:01:04.212 --> 01:01:06.590
Not a damn thing wrong with it.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.217
Waitress knows.

01:01:09.426 --> 01:01:13.763
All those bad kids in her house.

01:01:17.058 --> 01:01:19.185
Hey, baby.

01:01:21.855 --> 01:01:25.776
What a pleasant surprise to see you
here. l didn't expect to see you.

01:01:25.985 --> 01:01:28.321
A big surprise.

01:01:28.529 --> 01:01:30.114
Huh?

01:01:31.657 --> 01:01:33.576
What? How so?

01:01:33.826 --> 01:01:36.913
You nearly pissed in your pants
when you saw me,

01:01:37.121 --> 01:01:39.790
especially since you invited Clarke.

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:43.127
l didn't invite Clarke.
Anyway, Shadow invited Clarke.

01:01:45.588 --> 01:01:49.051
You always talk about how
you don't want to come to the clubs.

01:01:49.301 --> 01:01:51.970
I'm just surprised to see you here.

01:01:53.305 --> 01:01:57.601
- l had a sudden change of heart.
- I'm... I'm... I'm happy.

01:01:58.727 --> 01:02:00.395
I'm happy.

01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:04.691
But is she happy? ls she happy?

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.819
- I'm sorry. What?
- ls she happy?

01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:11.198
l like her dress, Bleek.

01:02:12.408 --> 01:02:14.827
l love the way you sing.

01:02:15.078 --> 01:02:17.497
You can really sing.

01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:21.042
I'm starting my own band.

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.586
Yeah.

01:02:23.795 --> 01:02:26.839
The Shadow Henderson Quartet,

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:30.176
featuring Miss Clarke Bentancourt.

01:02:32.345 --> 01:02:36.766
l know you can't make
that move right now, and this is cool,

01:02:36.976 --> 01:02:40.688
but, Clarke,
think about what I'm saying.

01:02:40.896 --> 01:02:43.899
All Bleek cares about is Bleek.

01:02:45.025 --> 01:02:47.653
- ls that so?
- Oh, so that is.

01:02:47.862 --> 01:02:49.947
Just take a look around.

01:02:50.155 --> 01:02:53.492
lt seems to me that
all Shadow cares about is Shadow.

01:02:53.742 --> 01:02:58.706
Anything, anyone that overshadows him,
he blocks them, like me.

01:02:58.956 --> 01:03:03.003
I'm supposed to be the leader
of this motherfucker, not Bleek.

01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:07.173
But I'm not,
so l have to get my own thing.

01:03:11.261 --> 01:03:12.888
You know...

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.727
l know you love Bleek, and that's
beautiful, black people in love.

01:03:18.935 --> 01:03:22.105
I'd be the last person
to come between you and him.

01:03:22.355 --> 01:03:25.275
But at some point,
you have to let this love shit go,

01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:28.613
and you have to think about respect.

01:03:28.821 --> 01:03:33.242
If he doesn't respect you,
then you don't need him.

01:03:34.827 --> 01:03:36.329
OK?

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.583
All l ask is that you think about
what I'm saying.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:44.503
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- No. Think about it.

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:49.508
- Promise?
- Yes.

01:03:49.717 --> 01:03:51.637
Promise, promise?

01:03:53.472 --> 01:03:55.599
l got to go. Er...

01:03:55.807 --> 01:03:58.435
It's getting a little crowded over here.

01:03:59.394 --> 01:04:03.607
Oh, er, by the way,...
l like your dress.

01:04:04.733 --> 01:04:06.693
It's hot.

01:04:06.902 --> 01:04:09.488
You got to let them know
who the boss is.

01:04:28.508 --> 01:04:31.511
How you doing?
You should watch the company you keep.

01:04:31.719 --> 01:04:34.681
- l could say the same for you.
- But you won't.

01:04:36.683 --> 01:04:38.309
Erm...

01:04:38.518 --> 01:04:42.147
- What are you thinking about?
- Right now?

01:04:42.398 --> 01:04:46.944
I'm thinking about you.
She came in on her own accord.

01:04:47.194 --> 01:04:49.822
It's a free country.
Want me to ask her to leave?

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:54.994
- Yeah. Send her home.
- Come on, baby. l can't do that.

01:04:55.202 --> 01:04:59.123
The point is this.
l asked you to come. You're here.

01:04:59.331 --> 01:05:02.877
You're the one I'm leaving with.
That's what counts, OK?

01:05:03.085 --> 01:05:04.086
OK?

01:05:05.672 --> 01:05:07.632
l like her dress.

01:05:10.302 --> 01:05:12.262
Enjoy the set.

01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:31.365
Shadow, my man, my main man,
how you doing?

01:05:32.408 --> 01:05:36.370
- What's up, Bleek?
- I'm good. Everything's...

01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:43.377
Listen, last time l looked
at Olarke's naked body,

01:05:43.628 --> 01:05:46.714
l didn't see my name on it anywhere.

01:05:46.923 --> 01:05:49.926
l mean, l didn't see it on her...

01:05:50.134 --> 01:05:52.094
l didn't see it anywhere.

01:05:52.303 --> 01:05:56.600
So if you're trying to push up on her,
don't sweat yourself, everything's OK.

01:05:56.850 --> 01:06:02.105
- Nobody owns anybody.
- You're absolutely right, Bleek.

01:06:02.314 --> 01:06:08.153
You know, you really
should listen to Clarke sing,

01:06:08.362 --> 01:06:13.325
or is it that you can only hear
your own music?

01:08:00.103 --> 01:08:02.481
What are you doing?
Indigo, that tickles.

01:08:02.689 --> 01:08:05.817
Get off! What did you call me?

01:08:06.026 --> 01:08:08.612
- l called you your name.
- The hell you did.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.031
l ain't deaf! You called me Indigo.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.284
What? No, come on.
l didn't call you Indigo.

01:08:14.493 --> 01:08:17.912
- l called you your name.
- Motherfucker, you called me Indigo.

01:08:18.205 --> 01:08:21.082
l can't even believe
you would have the audacity

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:25.087
to call me by your other woman's name.

01:08:25.337 --> 01:08:28.841
l ain't no fool.
l do know you have another woman.

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:31.678
- l ain't going for this shit.
- What is your name?

01:08:31.886 --> 01:08:33.845
Get off, Bleek!

01:08:36.307 --> 01:08:39.810
How in the hell
can you call me by her name?

01:08:40.019 --> 01:08:43.106
l am in your bed, Bleek...
Indigo, not Clarke.

01:08:43.856 --> 01:08:47.194
- I'm Clarke, not Indigo.
- l called you Clarke.

01:08:47.403 --> 01:08:49.947
You can practise
for eight hours straight

01:08:50.154 --> 01:08:53.200
and can't spend
the little bit of time it takes

01:08:53.408 --> 01:08:56.537
to learn the difference
between me and your other woman.

01:08:56.745 --> 01:09:00.666
Listen to me, Bleek.
l don't like it, l don't appreciate it,

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:03.836
and l don't want to be
disrespected by you!

01:09:04.002 --> 01:09:07.464
I've had it!
And you say that you love me?

01:09:07.673 --> 01:09:10.091
- l never said that.
- You did say that.

01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:14.221
- l don't remember it.
- Do you remember saying you care?

01:09:14.471 --> 01:09:15.890
Yeah, l remember that.

01:09:16.099 --> 01:09:20.312
If you say you care, then why in
the fuck are you still fucking Indigo?

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.314
Don't give me that
''It's a dick thing'' shit, either.

01:09:23.523 --> 01:09:27.402
Don't give me that
''lt's a dick thing'' shit, either.

01:09:27.611 --> 01:09:28.987
Look at me!

01:09:29.194 --> 01:09:30.697
Look at me, Bleek!

01:09:30.947 --> 01:09:32.908
What are you looking at?

01:09:35.453 --> 01:09:39.247
Why can't you look at me?
That's where the real me is.

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:43.961
You always avoid direct eye contact,
you know that?

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:48.466
Are you afraid of something?
Are you afraid l might see the real you?

01:09:48.674 --> 01:09:51.969
Answer me.
Come on, answer me.

01:09:52.886 --> 01:09:54.513
Think about that.

01:09:54.722 --> 01:09:56.474
Are you thinking, Bleek?

01:09:56.682 --> 01:09:58.476
Are you thinking?

01:09:58.684 --> 01:10:01.104
You don't know what to say, do you?

01:10:06.193 --> 01:10:09.988
There you go.
You can't face me, can you?

01:10:10.197 --> 01:10:13.492
Whenever you get in a jam,
you grab your trumpet.

01:10:16.286 --> 01:10:20.249
Let's cut the bullshit.
If you can hang, fine. If you can't...

01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:22.668
Let's not pretend anymore.

01:10:22.876 --> 01:10:26.256
Fine. Let's not pretend anymore!

01:10:29.634 --> 01:10:31.594
l can't hang.

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:01.792
Bleek, l want to know how many
laps you're going to do today.

01:11:02.042 --> 01:11:04.378
How many laps?

01:11:05.212 --> 01:11:07.172
You look good.

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:12.052
Bleek.

01:11:19.436 --> 01:11:22.439
You're not talking today, huh?

01:11:22.647 --> 01:11:25.275
- You want to talk?
- You're quiet.

01:11:26.484 --> 01:11:29.404
Usually, you're running your damn mouth.

01:11:33.909 --> 01:11:35.869
Want to race?

01:11:41.876 --> 01:11:44.462
Bleek!

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.255
Come on, Bleek! Hold up!

01:11:46.464 --> 01:11:48.883
- Come on.
- Hold up!

01:11:53.346 --> 01:11:55.306
You like that, huh?

01:12:01.103 --> 01:12:03.440
- Want some water?
- Nah.

01:12:07.277 --> 01:12:10.906
G, you're doing a half-assed job, man.

01:12:11.114 --> 01:12:14.159
You OK'd the deal.
You said get you the Dog, and l did.

01:12:14.368 --> 01:12:17.371
l got you the best terms possible
at the time.

01:12:17.537 --> 01:12:20.290
- You do it down the line.
- This is down the line.

01:12:20.499 --> 01:12:24.127
- I'm working on it.
- You're taking advantage of me.

01:12:24.336 --> 01:12:26.380
We grew up together.

01:12:26.588 --> 01:12:30.343
I'd rather chop off my left hand
than take advantage of you.

01:12:30.552 --> 01:12:32.512
This is about more than friendship.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.473
I'm breaking my friggin' neck for you.
Do l look rich?

01:12:35.682 --> 01:12:41.187
- Somebody's been talking to you.
- Nobody's been talking to me.

01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:44.482
All I'm saying is,
you got to do a better job.

01:12:44.691 --> 01:12:48.570
How many ass-whippings
have you saved me from? A lot.

01:12:48.778 --> 01:12:54.201
One of these days, l won't be around.
You'll have to take that ass-whipping.

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:58.581
- What do you want me to say?
- l don't want you to say anything.

01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:01.792
- l just want you to do it.
- I'll do a better job.

01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:04.378
All right, man.

01:13:04.587 --> 01:13:07.298
- What about that loan?
- What?

01:13:07.464 --> 01:13:11.760
- l need a loan.
- What about that loan?

01:13:12.011 --> 01:13:15.264
What did we just talk about?
Now you're going to ask for a loan?

01:13:15.472 --> 01:13:18.643
- Are you gambling again?
- l got it. It's under control.

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:21.104
You got it? Good.

01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:24.733
How much you owe?

01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:29.863
Just a little bit.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.537
- Nah?
- Nah.

01:13:37.787 --> 01:13:39.289
- Nah.
- Nah.

01:13:39.497 --> 01:13:41.459
I'm spacing.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.632
<i>This ls your Mr Senor Love Daddy</i>

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.176
<i>coming to you from We-Love radio,</i>

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:54.931
<i>108.5, last on your dial
and first ln your hearts,</i>

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:58.559
<i>and that's the truth, Ruth.</i>

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.519
<i>Wishing l was outdoors with you.</i>

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:03.606
<i>I'm gonna bring you
a blast from the past</i>

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:08.779
<i>from Miss Fontella Bass, Rescue Me.</i>

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.700
- Where you taking me?
- We're not going to kill you.

01:14:13.909 --> 01:14:17.037
We don't believe in killing
our brothers and sisters,

01:14:17.246 --> 01:14:19.957
but we got to do something,
it's only right.

01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:22.459
You going to get our money?

01:14:23.877 --> 01:14:24.878
- Huh?
- Yes.

01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:27.214
Yes only means something
when you said...

01:14:28.632 --> 01:14:33.596
Rod, wouldn't it be black of us to take
our brother to Brooklyn Hospital?

01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:35.807
Afro-American.

01:14:37.475 --> 01:14:40.270
Big Stop, what's taking you so long?
I'm hungry.

01:14:40.478 --> 01:14:43.982
Butterbean, quit fucking with me.
Get out of the kitchen.

01:14:44.232 --> 01:14:47.402
Big Stop Creole, y'all couldn't cook.

01:14:49.654 --> 01:14:51.739
You two niggers would burn cornflakes.

01:14:51.948 --> 01:14:53.825
Bleek, come get this nigger.

01:14:55.327 --> 01:15:00.291
So you fell off a bike, huh?
l don't believe your story.

01:15:00.499 --> 01:15:02.251
l hit a pothole.

01:15:02.459 --> 01:15:05.212
And l was born yesterday,
but l stayed up all night.

01:15:05.421 --> 01:15:09.258
- Food's ready. Come on!
- l hit a pothole.

01:15:09.466 --> 01:15:12.970
<i>Mon cheri, you can get me
a glass of wine. That's not good.</i>

01:15:20.061 --> 01:15:22.814
Look at y'all. lt looks delicious.

01:15:23.064 --> 01:15:24.691
Butterbean, don't do that.

01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:29.237
- I'm freaky. I'll suck a wet doorknob.
- You'll suck a what?

01:15:29.446 --> 01:15:31.948
You can get me a napkin.
It's so messy.

01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:34.200
<i>Oui, mon cheri. Mal Ma cherle.</i>

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:43.126
No.

01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:46.672
l got to watch you,
cos you are loose.

01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:49.258
You're just one of them yellow gals.

01:15:49.467 --> 01:15:53.846
Watch it, Butterbean.
l could slap you right in your mouth.

01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:56.390
But you ain't,
cos I'll kick your ass.

01:15:56.599 --> 01:15:59.185
<i>Sweatin' my gang
While I'm chlllin' in my shack</i>

01:15:59.393 --> 01:16:01.312
<i>And searchin' my car for what...</i>

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.272
Bottom?

01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:07.818
Hey, man, you already owe me
$300, home slice.

01:16:08.027 --> 01:16:09.863
- Branford?
- Hell, no!

01:16:11.782 --> 01:16:14.576
Left Hand, l need this solid, man.

01:16:14.743 --> 01:16:17.496
l wouldn't ask if l didn't need it.

01:16:17.704 --> 01:16:19.915
Jeanne. Jeanne.

01:16:20.123 --> 01:16:21.833
<i>Look, silence.</i>

01:16:22.042 --> 01:16:26.838
You got five? Give me five.

01:16:27.047 --> 01:16:29.091
Jeanne.

01:16:32.219 --> 01:16:35.139
- l need to get it back.
- You'll get it back.

01:16:35.348 --> 01:16:37.934
l don't appreciate
you calling me white bitch.

01:16:38.142 --> 01:16:42.772
Here we are. This is our music, right?
Jazz is our music. It's black music.

01:16:43.022 --> 01:16:47.777
We will go and watch some crossover
stuff that's created by other people,

01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:51.823
but we don't come to see our own, man.

01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:53.366
But the jazz...

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:58.121
If we had to depend upon on black people
to eat, we would starve to death.

01:16:58.372 --> 01:17:01.166
You look out into the audience,
and what do you see?

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:04.086
You see Japanese, West Germans,

01:17:04.295 --> 01:17:07.298
you see Slabovic, anything,
except our people, man.

01:17:07.548 --> 01:17:09.258
lt makes no sense.

01:17:09.466 --> 01:17:13.512
lt incenses me that our own people
don't realize our own heritage, culture.

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:16.682
- This is our music, man.
- That's bullshit.

01:17:16.891 --> 01:17:21.478
- Why?
- Everything you just said is bullshit.

01:17:21.687 --> 01:17:25.817
- Come on, man.
- Out of all the people in the world...

01:17:26.067 --> 01:17:29.195
l love you like a stepbrother,
but you never gave nobody else

01:17:29.404 --> 01:17:32.282
a chance to play their own music.

01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:34.409
I'm talking about the audience.

01:17:34.618 --> 01:17:37.954
You grandiose motherfuckers
don't play shit that they like.

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:41.917
If you play the shit they like,
people will come.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:45.629
- That's what I'm going to do.
- l see. l see.

01:17:45.837 --> 01:17:49.675
- I'll play the shit everybody like.
- l have my own voice.

01:17:49.884 --> 01:17:53.220
- People are listening.
- Everybody's deaf, brother.

01:17:53.387 --> 01:17:56.015
People are listening to my voice.

01:17:56.224 --> 01:17:58.559
- Ain't nobody coming.
- Nobody's coming?

01:17:58.809 --> 01:18:03.272
- You just said...
- l said our people aren't coming.

01:18:03.481 --> 01:18:06.484
That's what I'm talking about,
black people.

01:18:06.692 --> 01:18:11.155
Keep it down.
You got customers right here.

01:18:11.364 --> 01:18:15.869
Fuck them and fuck this shit.
The reality is...

01:18:16.078 --> 01:18:20.958
- Why you disrespecting my house?
- I'm not disrespecting your house.

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:25.712
Shut up.
You muscle-head nigger, shut up.

01:18:25.921 --> 01:18:28.674
Y'all can't play worth a goddamn.

01:18:28.882 --> 01:18:32.135
- King Kong shit.
- Who you trying to talk about?

01:18:32.344 --> 01:18:36.348
His head looks like a goddamn
question mark.

01:18:37.475 --> 01:18:39.435
You laugh at that shit?

01:18:42.272 --> 01:18:44.440
Put them lips on a trumpet,
motherfucker!

01:18:44.649 --> 01:18:49.153
l know Giant. If he's in, he'll come out
because he has to come out.

01:18:49.362 --> 01:18:54.951
If he's out, he'll come back to change
his underwear or throw the garbage out.

01:18:55.201 --> 01:18:58.329
Maybe not throw the garbage,
but he's gonna come back.

01:18:58.538 --> 01:19:03.168
They call him Giant
cos he's a giant pain in the ass.

01:19:03.419 --> 01:19:09.925
Sooner or later,
he's either going to go in or come out.

01:19:10.134 --> 01:19:14.388
l don't want no excuses.
l don't want to hear anything.

01:19:14.638 --> 01:19:17.933
''Forgive me.'' No.
That won't break no more.

01:19:18.142 --> 01:19:22.438
Let's give him a break.
Break his legs, his arms.

01:19:22.688 --> 01:19:27.360
l give him a lot of rope, but he won't
strangle me with my own rope.

01:19:29.279 --> 01:19:33.158
Sooner or later, in or out,
everybody, in or out of the house.

01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:38.330
Enough.

01:19:55.806 --> 01:19:59.602
- Hi, Shadow. How you doing?
- Fine, like yourself.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:02.438
- Will this be cash or charge?
- Charge.

01:20:02.688 --> 01:20:05.107
- You do take American Express?
- Yes, we do.

01:20:05.316 --> 01:20:08.277
Good. Gold action.

01:20:10.363 --> 01:20:13.783
- l was a member since 1989.
- That long?

01:20:13.991 --> 01:20:16.662
You look hot.
That dress makes you look like a zebra.

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:19.831
l could be Tarzan.
We could play in the jungle.

01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:24.962
Let me package you up
in one of these ODs,

01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:29.967
put you in my pocket,
my front one, to kiss on.

01:20:31.885 --> 01:20:33.929
Mm, mm-mm.

01:20:35.055 --> 01:20:37.182
- Shadow?
- Clarke.

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:40.895
Your account is declined.
l have to confiscate your card.

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:45.108
- l just paid them. Call them back.
- Just look right there.

01:20:49.529 --> 01:20:53.366
- It's cool. l got those anyway.
- Then why are you here?

01:20:53.616 --> 01:20:55.493
To see you.

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:04.210
All right.

01:21:08.215 --> 01:21:11.385
We're gonna do something...
Let me ask y'all something.

01:21:11.594 --> 01:21:14.096
How many of y'all out there
know about the blues?

01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:22.438
- l know about the blues, Bleek.
- l know l do, so...

01:21:24.648 --> 01:21:28.402
Well, anyway, we're going to do a tune
called Mo' Better Blues.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.339
Moe and Josh want to see you.

01:25:12.928 --> 01:25:14.847
The blues.

01:25:22.771 --> 01:25:25.733
- Don't forget my song, now.
- I'll see what l can do.

01:25:27.151 --> 01:25:29.486
- Bleek.
- What you doing out here?

01:25:29.695 --> 01:25:32.197
- l need a place to stay.
- For tonight?

01:25:32.448 --> 01:25:34.491
- For a while.
- All right.

01:25:34.658 --> 01:25:36.286
That's my brother.

01:25:38.747 --> 01:25:41.416
l talked with Moe and Josh again.

01:25:41.666 --> 01:25:44.502
- What happened?
- Contract. We're stuck.

01:25:44.753 --> 01:25:47.547
We're gonna get a new lawyer,
a real lawyer.

01:25:47.797 --> 01:25:50.300
l got one, my brother-in-law Moses.

01:25:50.508 --> 01:25:52.928
- Your brother-in-law Moses?
- He's cheap.

01:25:53.136 --> 01:25:55.472
Wait a minute. That's out, man.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.267
Your brother-in-law Moses...
What's the deal with your relatives?

01:25:59.476 --> 01:26:02.730
Your uncle's a plumber,
your cousin's a dent...

01:26:02.939 --> 01:26:05.691
Look at my teeth.
They're still messed up.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.569
l hate to say this,
but you got a fucked-up family.

01:26:08.778 --> 01:26:13.324
- Why you dogging my folks?
- I'm just tired of suppor...

01:26:13.532 --> 01:26:15.910
- I'm sick of your relatives.
- They love you.

01:26:16.118 --> 01:26:19.372
- They supported you from the beginning.
- l supported them.

01:26:19.622 --> 01:26:24.378
I'll keep my family
out of our business matters.

01:26:24.628 --> 01:26:27.547
I'm here to do your bidding.
That's my job.

01:26:32.135 --> 01:26:34.513
So how much you owe?

01:26:34.721 --> 01:26:36.640
Afraid to say.

01:26:39.393 --> 01:26:41.603
More than before.

01:26:57.704 --> 01:27:03.126
Look, I'll see how much l can raise, but
you got to get help. Your gig is over.

01:27:03.293 --> 01:27:08.965
I've been contemplating managing
myself anyway. l got to be in control.

01:27:09.173 --> 01:27:11.259
If that's what you want.

01:27:11.467 --> 01:27:15.264
- That's what l want. You're fired.
- You're cutting everybody off.

01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:20.811
Me, Indigo, Clarke. Especially me.

01:27:21.061 --> 01:27:24.607
I'm not cutting anybody off.
I'm looking out for myself.

01:27:24.815 --> 01:27:26.942
Besides, Indigo and Clarke cut me off.

01:27:27.192 --> 01:27:29.653
That ain't what l heard.

01:27:30.821 --> 01:27:32.906
How long you known me?

01:27:33.115 --> 01:27:36.160
- Since third grade.
- That's got to count for something.

01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:40.248
If l didn't know you since third grade,
I'd have fired you a long time ago.

01:27:40.498 --> 01:27:43.960
- You're that unhappy with my work?
- I've been that unhappy.

01:27:44.169 --> 01:27:47.255
That's beside the point.
The bottom line is this.

01:27:47.464 --> 01:27:50.050
OK, here's the thing.

01:27:53.553 --> 01:27:56.389
The offer stands as it was.
You can stay at my house.

01:27:56.598 --> 01:27:59.392
I'll help you get some money
before you get killed,

01:27:59.601 --> 01:28:03.356
but... you're going to do something
about that gambling.

01:28:03.564 --> 01:28:07.860
All right, all right, all right.
I'll get it together.

01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:10.071
l know I'm sick.

01:28:42.938 --> 01:28:46.108
<i>This ls Indigo.
I'm unable to come to the phone.</i>

01:28:46.316 --> 01:28:49.736
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get right back to you.</i>

01:28:49.945 --> 01:28:53.825
Hello, Indigo,... it's me.

01:28:56.661 --> 01:28:58.621
It's me.

01:29:00.248 --> 01:29:03.126
<i>l was just calling
to see how you're doing.</i>

01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:06.838
<i>l miss you. Look, erm...</i>

01:29:07.046 --> 01:29:10.508
Call me if and when you feel like it.
Later.

01:29:44.085 --> 01:29:47.672
<i>This ls Clarke. I'm busy,
but l do appreciate your call.</i>

01:29:47.881 --> 01:29:51.176
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep. Ciao.</i>

01:29:51.384 --> 01:29:53.428
<i>- Er...</i>

01:29:55.388 --> 01:29:58.058
This is me, Bleek. How you doing?

01:29:59.392 --> 01:30:04.314
- Let me turn this off.
- No, no, no. No.

01:30:04.522 --> 01:30:06.484
l want to hear this.

01:30:06.692 --> 01:30:08.611
<i>l haven't seen you ln a while.</i>

01:30:08.861 --> 01:30:11.614
He's begging. Boy, that Bleek.

01:30:11.822 --> 01:30:16.243
He only wants you when he wants you.
l want to make you a full-time gig.

01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:19.413
l don't believe what a man says.

01:30:20.456 --> 01:30:26.295
Well, in this particular instance,
in this particular case, believe me.

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:29.966
The rest of the time,
only believe half of what a man says.

01:30:30.174 --> 01:30:34.721
Half is truth. The other half is bull.

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:37.933
Which half are you?

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:42.980
- Half.
- Yeah, half of what?

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:44.606
- Half.
- See?

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:49.611
- l don't believe anything y'all say.
- It's not what l say, it's what l do.

01:32:09.362 --> 01:32:12.323
- What's up?
- Where's the money?

01:32:12.531 --> 01:32:14.951
- I'm working on it.
- Don't work too long.

01:32:15.159 --> 01:32:17.620
ln the meanwhile,
stay out the spotlight.

01:32:17.787 --> 01:32:20.790
- What are you going to do?
- ln the words of Darryl Dawkins,

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.752
''When all is said and done,
there's nothing left to say or do.''

01:32:24.961 --> 01:32:28.923
- Whatever happened to that brother?
- He's on Lovetron.

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:35.806
B, l don't like no static.
I'm a peaceful person.

01:32:36.014 --> 01:32:38.934
And even though you fired my ass,
you're still my boy.

01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:43.814
l look out for your best interests.
When was the last time you seen Clarke?

01:32:44.022 --> 01:32:46.984
l don't know. What's up?

01:32:48.527 --> 01:32:50.279
Shadow's boning Clarke.

01:32:50.487 --> 01:32:54.157
Oh, Shadow! Oh, yeah!

01:32:54.366 --> 01:32:57.703
Yeah, baby, you like it.
I'm going to give it to you good.

01:32:57.953 --> 01:33:00.456
lt feels good.

01:33:00.665 --> 01:33:03.251
I'm just a bear, baby,
just a bear.

01:33:03.501 --> 01:33:06.796
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.683
Hey, you know, it ain't no thing.

01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:20.810
l hope he's happy.

01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:25.399
- Are you positive?
- What did l say?

01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:36.660
Yo, Roberto. l don't want to hear
nothing about no music.

01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:39.204
- What's up?
- Yeah, hi.

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:41.957
- Yo, Bleek. Yo, Bleek.
- What?

01:33:42.166 --> 01:33:44.126
Hold up for a minute. Check this out.

01:33:44.293 --> 01:33:46.879
Me and the cats
want to have a meeting after this.

01:33:47.129 --> 01:33:53.595
- Get out of my face, Shadow.
- We need to talk about the money.

01:33:53.803 --> 01:33:56.348
See them people out there?
It's packed.

01:33:56.556 --> 01:34:00.560
l ain't playing shit no more
till l deal with this money situation.

01:34:00.769 --> 01:34:03.438
- Get out of my face.
- Listen to what I'm saying.

01:34:03.647 --> 01:34:07.734
- Just get the fuck...
- Who you pushing, man?

01:34:09.527 --> 01:34:11.446
Kick his ass!

01:34:19.872 --> 01:34:22.208
- Just relax, man.
- You're fired, punk!

01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:23.584
Fuck you, l quit!

01:34:23.793 --> 01:34:26.379
Fuck you and everybody
who looks like you.

01:34:26.587 --> 01:34:29.840
Fucking people over.
Sooner or later it'll come back.

01:34:30.132 --> 01:34:33.261
Anybody else want to go with him?
Take a hike!

01:34:33.469 --> 01:34:36.055
Get his raggedy ass out of here.

01:34:41.937 --> 01:34:44.314
You're fired, punk!

01:34:44.523 --> 01:34:47.484
Get him out of here!
You're fired!

01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:53.448
- You're fired!
- Let's talk to Bleek, man.

01:34:53.699 --> 01:34:57.452
l got to get paid. l need this job, man.

01:35:03.668 --> 01:35:07.130
- What's up, Jimmy?
- What's up, Giant?

01:35:07.338 --> 01:35:10.717
Moe and Josh are some
cheap goober snitchers.

01:35:20.977 --> 01:35:23.146
We don't believe
in killing our brothers,

01:35:23.396 --> 01:35:26.817
but this time
you're definitely going to be hurt.

01:35:27.026 --> 01:35:28.986
Get the fuck off.

01:35:35.242 --> 01:35:37.202
Get off me!

01:35:39.705 --> 01:35:42.374
- Isn't that Giant?
- Bleek!

01:35:53.303 --> 01:35:55.764
What did l do?

01:36:00.268 --> 01:36:02.437
You're breaking my arm.

01:36:03.063 --> 01:36:07.067
- Up, up, and away.
- Chill! Chill! Chill!

01:36:16.494 --> 01:36:19.288
Don't break them.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.880
That's the way it goes.

01:36:28.798 --> 01:36:29.924
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:36:30.132 --> 01:36:33.886
Oh, yeah!
One more. Another one.

01:36:35.638 --> 01:36:38.599
The Mike Tyson now. There you go.

01:36:41.812 --> 01:36:44.064
Hold it.

01:36:44.314 --> 01:36:46.275
Bleek!

01:36:55.701 --> 01:36:58.996
- Get the fuck up.
- Get up.

01:36:59.204 --> 01:37:00.789
Bleek!

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:11.050
Oh, shit.

01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:13.970
Brooklyn style.

01:37:14.137 --> 01:37:18.099
Your alligator mouth finally got
your hummingbird ass whipped.

01:37:18.308 --> 01:37:20.852
- Chill out, man.
- Ain't nothing to see here.

01:37:27.734 --> 01:37:29.945
Bleek!

01:38:07.567 --> 01:38:10.320
Wake up!

01:38:10.528 --> 01:38:13.657
Go on, brother. lt won't be pretty.

01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:17.619
G?

01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:25.836
- l was getting him the money tonight.
- Too late.

01:38:26.045 --> 01:38:28.339
He ain't dead. He be all right.

01:38:30.299 --> 01:38:36.347
- Why you do something like that?
- We going to have to give him some too.

01:38:38.182 --> 01:38:40.977
- Straighten up.
- Oh, shit!

01:38:41.185 --> 01:38:44.523
Damn it, give me the fucking horn.

01:38:46.316 --> 01:38:47.734
Son of a bitch.

01:39:05.502 --> 01:39:08.423
- Get out the way.
- Let us through.

01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:13.511
What the fuck went on here?
Let us through.

01:39:17.223 --> 01:39:20.727
You busted his mouth!
You busted his mouth!

01:39:20.977 --> 01:39:24.147
- Do something, man.
- He's bleeding, man.

01:39:24.314 --> 01:39:26.858
Go back inside and play.

01:39:27.108 --> 01:39:29.569
- No.
- We got a full house in there.

01:39:29.777 --> 01:39:31.822
- Let's close it up.
- Fuck them!

01:39:32.072 --> 01:39:35.326
- Leave it alone.
- We're never playing this place again.

01:39:35.534 --> 01:39:40.581
- Don't say that. You're upset.
- You're goddamn right I'm upset.

01:39:40.789 --> 01:39:44.168
My friend is laying here
with his mouth busted open.

01:39:44.418 --> 01:39:46.712
We're closed. Everybody go home.

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:51.550
- Did you call the ambulance?
- Are you going to move, or what?

01:39:55.554 --> 01:39:57.307
Get out of the way!

01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.980
Don't move him, man!

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:26.379
The first fight you ever got in,

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:30.257
your mother wanted me to break it up,

01:40:30.508 --> 01:40:36.055
call the cops,
go and talk to the parents of the kid.

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:39.058
l figured, kids are going to fight,

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:45.398
and you must have been only...
six, seven,...

01:40:46.984 --> 01:40:53.407
so we were just talking about
little bare fists, just skin.

01:40:55.617 --> 01:41:02.291
That was way before kids
started shooting each other with Uzis.

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:06.336
l watched you from the window

01:41:06.545 --> 01:41:09.756
going toe to toe, slugging it out.

01:41:12.427 --> 01:41:18.641
Your mother never forgave me,
but l got to admit l was kind of proud.

01:41:21.311 --> 01:41:25.440
You gave the kid a bloody nose,
but you didn't kill him.

01:41:25.607 --> 01:41:29.444
That's a part of growing up.

01:41:30.737 --> 01:41:34.782
You ran up the stairs, crying.

01:41:35.034 --> 01:41:38.621
You were more scared than the kid was.

01:41:44.918 --> 01:41:48.047
Wasn't that Giant? That was Giant.

01:42:11.696 --> 01:42:14.199
Shit, man. Shit.

01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:21.206
The light.

01:42:21.414 --> 01:42:23.750
Truth is the light.

01:42:23.959 --> 01:42:26.003
Prophetic, right?

01:42:26.253 --> 01:42:30.174
Truth is light, though,
that's the truth, isn't it? Lighten up.

01:42:32.051 --> 01:42:34.387
That some bad shit.

01:42:38.307 --> 01:42:43.062
Trumpet-playing motherfucker.
On trumpet, Bleek.

01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:45.606
Tenor, soprano, saxophones.

01:42:48.359 --> 01:42:51.905
John Coltrane, tenor sax. Tenor.

01:42:52.072 --> 01:42:55.409
You got to improvise that music.
It's all intricate, see?

01:42:55.617 --> 01:42:57.828
lt goes...

01:42:58.078 --> 01:43:00.831
See? See? See?

01:43:05.752 --> 01:43:10.590
It's some intricate shit, though.
They ain't ready for this shit.

01:43:16.139 --> 01:43:19.600
<i>And he was the quarterback
of the football team.</i>

01:43:19.809 --> 01:43:23.813
<i>He was this tall,
big, fine, black specimen.</i>

01:43:24.022 --> 01:43:26.107
<i>- Mandingo, huh?
- No.</i>

01:43:26.316 --> 01:43:30.612
Anyway, the first time
l fell in love was...

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:32.780
Was when? No, l remember.

01:43:32.989 --> 01:43:36.701
lt was... lt was... lt was innocent.

01:43:36.951 --> 01:43:41.373
- She felt the same way, too.
- Yeah? So how recent was this?

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:45.336
Last Tuesday. Last week.
No, it was Wednesday.

01:43:45.544 --> 01:43:48.422
- The fourth grade.
- ln the fourth grade?

01:43:48.631 --> 01:43:50.591
Thank you. You had me worried.

01:43:50.799 --> 01:43:54.345
We used to pass notes back and forth.

01:43:54.553 --> 01:44:00.559
One day she met me in the courtyard
after school, and she kissed me.

01:44:00.768 --> 01:44:02.687
- French kiss?
- We French kissed.

01:44:02.896 --> 01:44:05.190
And l was, like, wow.

01:44:07.567 --> 01:44:11.905
- l never felt that way since.
- Not even with me?

01:44:12.113 --> 01:44:14.199
<i>- What ls this?
- What ls what?</i>

01:44:14.407 --> 01:44:18.620
<i>Are we lovers, or what?
Why don't you try and find that girl</i>

01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:22.332
<i>and marry her
and live happily ever after?</i>

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:24.668
<i>You still love me?</i>

01:44:26.353 --> 01:44:30.154
ONE YEAR LATER

01:44:57.244 --> 01:45:01.331
- G.
- Bleek, what's up?

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.292
How you doing, man?

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.628
Where you been? Ain't nobody seen
hide nor hair of your ass.

01:45:06.837 --> 01:45:09.256
You know, I'm...

01:45:09.464 --> 01:45:11.800
How you doing?

01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:14.594
I'm all right.
l got this job now. I'm a doorman.

01:45:14.803 --> 01:45:18.308
l stopped gambling.
You should be proud of me.

01:45:18.516 --> 01:45:21.102
l still got to go to those meetings
once a week.

01:45:21.352 --> 01:45:23.313
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:45:25.523 --> 01:45:27.692
You sitting in with Shadow?

01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.028
We talked about it.

01:45:30.236 --> 01:45:34.824
Yeah? Good. Shadow and Clarke
are doing all right now.

01:45:35.033 --> 01:45:38.828
Yeah, l... I'm happy for him, man.

01:45:38.995 --> 01:45:42.750
He always wanted his own band.
I'm happy for him.

01:45:42.958 --> 01:45:45.711
- Big time.
- Big time.

01:45:45.961 --> 01:45:48.714
- I'm gonna step on inside, man.
- I'll come with you.

01:45:48.964 --> 01:45:51.425
- All right.
- l got to hear you.

01:45:51.634 --> 01:45:53.385
Right.

01:45:54.094 --> 01:45:58.682
<i>You can never tell
what's ln a man's mind</i>

01:46:01.852 --> 01:46:07.817
<i>And If he's from Harlem
there's no use of even trying</i>

01:46:09.819 --> 01:46:15.700
<i>Just like the tilde
his mind comes and goes</i>

01:46:17.911 --> 01:46:21.456
<i>Like March weather
when he'll change</i>

01:46:21.706 --> 01:46:26.628
<i>Nobody knows, nobody knows</i>

01:46:26.836 --> 01:46:32.093
<i>The man l love
Well, he just turned me down</i>

01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:34.887
<i>He's a Harlem brown</i>

01:46:35.137 --> 01:46:38.516
<i>Oft times l wish
that l was ln this ground</i>

01:46:39.475 --> 01:46:43.062
<i>Six feet underground</i>

01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:48.484
<i>He allows me as no other could</i>

01:46:52.029 --> 01:46:56.034
<i>Then he surprised me
leaving me a note saying he's</i>

01:46:56.243 --> 01:47:02.082
<i>Gone for good</i>

01:47:02.291 --> 01:47:06.336
<i>And since my sweetie left me hollow</i>

01:47:07.379 --> 01:47:10.382
<i>Well, lt ain't the same old place</i>

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:16.722
<i>Though a thousand dandles
smile right ln my face</i>

01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:23.062
<i>l think I'll mooch some
home-made hooch and go out for a lark</i>

01:47:23.313 --> 01:47:30.778
<i>Just to drive off these mean old
Harlem blues</i>

01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:39.621
<i>You can have your Broadway
Give me Lenox Avenue</i>

01:47:41.205 --> 01:47:43.207
<i>Angels from the skies stroll Seventh</i>

01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:47.504
<i>And for that thanks are due</i>

01:47:47.755 --> 01:47:50.549
<i>From Madame Walker's beauty shops to</i>

01:47:50.799 --> 01:47:53.177
<i>The Poro system too</i>

01:47:54.053 --> 01:47:59.266
<i>That made those girls angels
without any doubt</i>

01:47:59.475 --> 01:48:03.145
<i>There are some spots up ln Harlem</i>

01:48:03.354 --> 01:48:06.982
<i>Where I'm told It's sudden death</i>

01:48:07.232 --> 01:48:12.656
<i>To let somebody see you
even stop to catch your breath</i>

01:48:12.822 --> 01:48:16.117
<i>If you've never been to Harlem</i>

01:48:16.368 --> 01:48:19.412
<i>Then l guess you'll never know</i>

01:48:19.621 --> 01:48:25.710
<i>About these mean old Harlem blues</i>

01:48:26.711 --> 01:48:29.339
<i>There's one sweet spot ln Harlem</i>

01:48:29.547 --> 01:48:32.759
<i>Known as Drivers' Road</i>

01:48:32.968 --> 01:48:38.391
<i>Ditty folk song call 'em
One thing you should know</i>

01:48:38.599 --> 01:48:42.019
<i>ls that l have a friend
who lives there</i>

01:48:42.228 --> 01:48:44.522
<i>l know he won't refuse</i>

01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:50.820
<i>To put some music to my troubles
and call them Harlem Blues</i>

01:48:51.028 --> 01:48:54.115
<i>To put some music to my troubles and</i>

01:48:54.365 --> 01:49:01.081
<i>Call them the Harlem Blues</i>

01:49:06.670 --> 01:49:08.630
<i>Harlem</i>

01:49:09.923 --> 01:49:13.427
<i>The Harlem Blues</i>

01:49:16.305 --> 01:49:18.265
<i>Harlem</i>

01:49:19.308 --> 01:49:22.729
<i>The Harlem Blues</i>

01:49:34.115 --> 01:49:36.617
Clarke sure can sing, Bleek.

01:49:42.498 --> 01:49:44.459
Thank you.

01:49:45.627 --> 01:49:48.088
Er...

01:49:48.297 --> 01:49:52.843
Right now I'd like to bring to the stage
a fine musician

01:49:53.052 --> 01:49:57.056
and, as well, a very dear friend.

01:49:57.264 --> 01:50:01.602
Please give a warm welcome
to Mr Bleek Gilliam.

01:50:09.276 --> 01:50:11.320
Bleek!

01:51:48.963 --> 01:51:50.924
Come on, Bleek!

01:51:56.722 --> 01:51:59.141
What are you doing this for?

01:52:00.392 --> 01:52:02.353
Nah.

01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:06.190
Come on, Bleek.

01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:10.903
Forget about it.

01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:13.572
Man, you're gonna be all right.

01:52:15.075 --> 01:52:17.243
Forget about it.

01:52:17.452 --> 01:52:19.412
Come on, Bleek.

01:52:23.208 --> 01:52:25.126
You'll play again.

01:52:25.377 --> 01:52:27.420
You'll play again.

01:52:28.838 --> 01:52:30.799
l won't sell it.

01:52:32.384 --> 01:52:34.427
l won't sell it, Bleek!

01:52:37.639 --> 01:52:39.684
l won't sell it!

01:53:03.249 --> 01:53:05.210
Indigo!

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:14.720
Indigo!

01:53:18.849 --> 01:53:22.477
Who is it?
Who the hell is ringing my bell?

01:53:26.565 --> 01:53:30.069
Hello, Indigo. Can l come in?

01:53:39.495 --> 01:53:43.082
You didn't return
my calls or my letters.

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.461
Refused my visits.

01:53:51.007 --> 01:53:53.510
lt doesn't matter now.
l just want to...

01:53:53.761 --> 01:53:55.804
lt doesn't matter?

01:53:56.013 --> 01:53:58.599
l haven't heard from you in over a year.

01:53:58.849 --> 01:54:01.060
l didn't know if you were alive or dead.

01:54:01.268 --> 01:54:03.771
I'm sorry. Look, l didn't know.

01:54:04.855 --> 01:54:08.776
l haven't seen anybody.
The only one I've seen is my father.

01:54:09.777 --> 01:54:11.904
You've always been a selfish person.

01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:14.948
l admit that. I'm selfish.
I'm a selfish...

01:54:15.157 --> 01:54:19.996
Did l ever try to stand in your way or
stop you from doing what you had to do?

01:54:20.246 --> 01:54:21.956
Did l?

01:54:22.165 --> 01:54:24.584
Can you get out, please?

01:54:25.335 --> 01:54:27.796
l want you to leave, Bleek.

01:54:29.214 --> 01:54:31.257
l want you to leave!

01:54:34.302 --> 01:54:37.389
l just want to...
Just let me say something.

01:54:37.555 --> 01:54:42.561
The only reason you're here
is because you can't play anymore.

01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:46.691
- Did you stop by Clarke's house?
- It's got nothing to do with Clarke.

01:54:46.899 --> 01:54:50.778
l read this book, a story
about a plane that was going down.

01:54:50.987 --> 01:54:54.198
lt was going to crash into the sea,
and this married couple,

01:54:54.407 --> 01:54:57.535
they start making love
to each other ferociously

01:54:57.785 --> 01:55:00.079
like their lives just depended upon it.

01:55:00.287 --> 01:55:04.959
They were oblivious to everything.
They didn't care.

01:55:05.167 --> 01:55:07.879
The plane was going down,
they were all gonna die,

01:55:08.088 --> 01:55:12.301
but they loved each other dearly
and they wanted to die together.

01:55:12.509 --> 01:55:14.970
They loved each other.

01:55:16.096 --> 01:55:19.725
- l want to be with you.
- Bleek, stop it.

01:55:26.231 --> 01:55:28.191
- Indigo.
- What?

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.155
- l want you to be with me.
- Get off. What about before?

01:55:32.363 --> 01:55:36.576
- l don't care about it.
- l don't wanna hold you.

01:55:36.826 --> 01:55:40.246
- l want us to have a son.
- Get off me. A fucking son.

01:55:40.455 --> 01:55:42.957
What do you think this is?

01:55:43.958 --> 01:55:47.879
You just want me to drop everything now
and just trust you?

01:55:49.339 --> 01:55:51.799
l want you to be with me.

01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:55.261
- l want you to be my wife.
- You crazy?

01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:57.640
- I'm not crazy.
- Go tell somebody else.

01:55:57.848 --> 01:56:01.602
- I'm telling you.
- You want me to save your life.

01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:04.271
Yes. l want you to save my life.

01:56:04.521 --> 01:56:07.858
Stop it, Bleek. Stop it! Stop it!

01:56:08.651 --> 01:56:11.612
Get off. l don't want to be...

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:15.658
Fucking bastard. Get off me. Stop it!

01:56:15.866 --> 01:56:18.952
You want me to beg?
I'm begging. Save my life.

01:56:20.329 --> 01:56:22.332
Please.

01:56:24.084 --> 01:56:26.044
Save my life.

01:58:15.783 --> 01:58:19.119
Relatives and friends,
we are gathered here in the sight of God

01:58:19.328 --> 01:58:21.246
and the presence of these witnesses

01:58:21.455 --> 01:58:24.918
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

01:58:25.126 --> 01:58:29.964
Will thou, Minifield Gilliam,
have this woman to be thy wedded wife?

01:58:30.173 --> 01:58:32.050
l will.

01:58:32.258 --> 01:58:35.887
Will thou, Indigo Downes, have this man
to be thy wedded husband?

01:58:36.096 --> 01:58:37.097
l will.

01:58:37.305 --> 01:58:39.683
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

You may salute your bride, sir.

Bleek!

01:59:24.771 --> 01:59:26.231

I'm going to take you to your room.

01:59:54.177 --> 01:59:57.347
Push, darling, push.

01:59:58.473 --> 02:00:01.559
That's it. It's coming.

02:00:01.768 --> 02:00:04.104
Come on.

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:19.119
There you go.
Nice little baby boy.

02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:22.289
Don't hold him too tight now.
Don't let him fall.

02:00:22.539 --> 02:00:26.418
Congratulations, Mrs Gilliam.
You have a son.

02:00:33.051 --> 02:00:36.805
Here, keep the change.
Here, have a cigar.

02:00:37.013 --> 02:00:40.392
Stay right there, baby. Dad! Big Stop!

02:00:44.396 --> 02:00:47.148
All right, thanks a lot.

02:00:47.357 --> 02:00:49.567
Dad, you've made the baby cry now.

02:00:49.776 --> 02:00:52.321
- He looks like me.
- What do you mean?

02:00:52.530 --> 02:00:54.490
- Look at his nose.
- Come on, baby.

02:00:54.699 --> 02:00:57.326
This is your ball.

02:00:57.535 --> 02:01:01.664
This is your glove,
a present from Grandpa to Miles.

02:01:01.872 --> 02:01:05.042

That's right. Keep your mouth closed.
Don't open it. Keep it closed.

02:02:01.893 --> 02:02:04.020
Now blow right in there.

02:02:04.228 --> 02:02:09.193
Blow hard. Harder.
Uh-oh! Hey, you hear that?

Boys! Boys, would you please be quiet?

02:02:43.269 --> 02:02:46.231
Sorry, Mrs Gilliam. Can Miles come out?

02:02:46.439 --> 02:02:49.567
l understand that.
Your noise has got to stop.

02:02:49.776 --> 02:02:51.820
Stop yelling outside my window.

02:02:54.532 --> 02:02:57.201
Those kids are gonna drive me crazy.

02:02:59.495 --> 02:03:04.041
Miles, what did l tell you about
your hoodlum friends coming here?

02:03:04.291 --> 02:03:08.504
- Leave the boy alone.
- Can l go outside now?

02:03:08.671 --> 02:03:11.632
- When you finish your lesson.
- What about then?

02:03:11.799 --> 02:03:13.759
We'll see.

02:03:13.968 --> 02:03:16.012
Miles!

02:03:18.222 --> 02:03:20.600
Son, you're finished for the day.

02:03:20.809 --> 02:03:23.729
Take your time. Put your jacket on.

Let the boy have some fun now.

02:03:34.114 --> 02:03:35.949
Uh-huh.

02:03:36.158 --> 02:03:38.869
Like he never has any fun at all.

02:03:39.119 --> 02:03:42.247
- He gets to have some fun.
- He has to stay in the dungeon.

02:03:42.456 --> 02:03:45.835
He never has any fun.
