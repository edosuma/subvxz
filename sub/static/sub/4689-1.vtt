01:09.569 --> 01:10.912
Province of Québec. 1966.

01:11.037 --> 01:12.846
80% of inhabitants are Francophone,

01:12.939 --> 01:15.920
but the economy is controlled
by the English minority.

01:16.042 --> 01:19.387
English is the language
of the workplace and finance.

01:19.512 --> 01:25.019
Management jobs in the private and federal
sectors are restricted to Anglophones.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.540
Labor laws heavily favor business.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.945
Labor conflicts multiply,
but working conditions don't change.

01:45.071 --> 01:51.750
Quebec workers are excluded from
the prosperity sweeping North America.

01:53.246 --> 01:54.589
Wait here.

02:03.756 --> 02:07.829
Some Quebecers believe political reform
cannot change the rules of a game

02:07.961 --> 02:10.066
in which they are
the eternal losers.

02:10.163 --> 02:13.975
They are increasingly convinced

02:14.100 --> 02:19.277
that more radical measures are in order.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.200
Be seated.

02:42.328 --> 02:46.003
MARCH 1966

02:46.132 --> 02:48.544
This is your new classmate.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.684
His name is Jean Corbo.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.445
I'll leave him in your hands.

03:07.453 --> 03:08.989
Welcome, Mr Corbo.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.025
Mr Gagnon!

03:12.458 --> 03:15.234
Stop your antics.
Make room for him.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.832
Yes, sir.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.703
Sit down.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.161
What kind of name is Corbo?

03:41.254 --> 03:43.256
Is it spelled
like the word for crow?

03:43.389 --> 03:46.165
No, it ends in O. It's Italian.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.506
Hey guys! The new kid's a wop.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.005
Quiet.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.863
Sorry, I didn't see you.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.368
<i>Did you see two kids?</i>

04:26.132 --> 04:28.578
<i>Two kids prowling around here.</i>

04:28.701 --> 04:30.612
Where's the nearest exit?

04:32.805 --> 04:33.943
Wait here.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.711
Quick.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.982
<i>Mr Corbo, there are
two young intruders.</i>

04:39.112 --> 04:40.557
<i>Did</i> you see them?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.217
<i>They wen! Down there.</i>

04:42.715 --> 04:44.058
Ruffians!

04:52.592 --> 04:56.005
The nearest exit?
Down the hall and turn right.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.769
The door's at the end,
can't miss it.

05:03.403 --> 05:04.905
Thanks.

05:14.147 --> 05:19.028
THE AX: OFFICIAL BULLETIN
OF THE FLQ <i>/</i> QUEBEC LIBERATION FRONT.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.992
<i>To all patriots
and political prisoners.</i>

05:59.826 --> 06:01.669
<i>Be brave in your solitude.</i>

06:02.795 --> 06:04.468
<i>Be patient as you wait.</i>

06:09.569 --> 06:13.244
<i>Tomorrow the enemy will pay
for our blood and tears.</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:19.585
<i>Your judges will be judged,
your accusers singled out.</i>

06:21.347 --> 06:23.725
<i>Your jailers will hand us
their keys.</i>

06:24.584 --> 06:26.325
<i>We cry your names.</i>

06:26.486 --> 06:29.558
<i>If you don't answer,
we will carry them forth.</i>

06:34.026 --> 06:36.666
<i>Monuments aren't built
to the living.</i>

06:40.933 --> 06:42.435
<i>We'll show no mercy.</i>

06:43.369 --> 06:45.178
<i>It's the enemy or us.</i>

06:46.873 --> 06:50.616
<i>Rise and crush the traitors
who block progress.</i>

06:52.578 --> 06:55.286
Guys, look what I found!

06:55.448 --> 06:59.191
- Where were they'?
- In a locker near the dynamite.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.127
Can't leave them here!

07:13.199 --> 07:15.236
Quit playing. Give us a hand.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.373
<i>Chénier said,</i>

07:17.470 --> 07:21.543
<i>"“When our brothers are killed,
you will take up their guns."</i>

07:27.413 --> 07:30.257
<i>We follow the path
laid by the Patriotes.</i>

07:30.383 --> 07:32.090
<i>That was over a century ago.</i>

07:32.652 --> 07:34.325
<i>It's time to finish!</i>

07:36.389 --> 07:38.460
It's a battle of egos.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.070
It's more serious than that, Nicola.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.170
Lesage attacked Lévesque
to protect himself.

07:45.498 --> 07:49.173
That's what I said.
It's all about ego.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.339
Not quite the same.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.974
Your party is out of touch.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.814
My party? It's not my party!

07:57.410 --> 07:59.515
It's for anyone concerned

07:59.645 --> 08:02.649
about putting bread and butter
on their table.

08:02.782 --> 08:03.852
Oh yeah?

08:04.350 --> 08:06.626
While you worry about profits,

08:06.752 --> 08:09.631
the RIN works
for social progress,

08:09.755 --> 08:13.259
to defend French
and liberate Quebecers!

08:13.359 --> 08:16.363
- Is that what really matters?
- Come on, Dad!

08:16.496 --> 08:19.136
Downtown they tell Mom,
"Speak white!"

08:19.265 --> 08:21.472
- You call that normal?
- So what?

08:23.369 --> 08:25.815
- I can speak Italian too.
- Italian's better.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.514
And we'll speak French when need be.

08:30.643 --> 08:34.056
Until then,
let's focus on good government.

08:34.179 --> 08:38.525
There are strikes across Québec.
The economy is paralyzed.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.520
You can thank your party, Dad.

08:45.992 --> 08:46.993
Anyway...

08:49.529 --> 08:54.035
To me that matters more than blaming
poor Eaton's salesladies

08:54.166 --> 08:56.043
who can't speak French.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.342
Not can't speak French.
Don't want to.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.747
Don't you see?
The world's changing, Dad.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.382
It'll take new ideas
to avert civil war.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.492
Your party hates new ideas.

09:08.581 --> 09:12.427
In that case, go on,
vote for the RIN, son.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.591
The Right will benefit,
and it doesn't share your ideas.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.091
Then it's goodbye to change.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.068
Because if the UN takes power,

09:21.193 --> 09:24.572
it'll be a step back
of at least 15 years!

09:24.697 --> 09:25.903
Good!

09:26.032 --> 09:29.070
You'd throw away 15 years?

09:29.201 --> 09:31.545
- If that's what it takes!
- Basra!

09:32.104 --> 09:35.847
You're always going on
about goddamn politics!

09:35.942 --> 09:37.387
- Sorry.
- Jeez.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.512
You're right. That's enough.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.622
At the table you don't talk
politics or religion.

09:44.784 --> 09:48.755
You end up fighting and then
you choke on your food and die.

09:49.388 --> 09:53.598
- As your mom always said.
- Leave Mom out of it.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.433
What are you thinking exactly?

09:57.563 --> 10:01.204
That you're part
of the discussion, maybe?

10:01.300 --> 10:04.873
You go on about it.
You're so concerned about it.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.451
We don't count for shit! You hear?

10:07.573 --> 10:11.214
We don't count?
What do you mean? Of course we do!

10:11.310 --> 10:14.655
We're not trapped in the past
like you.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.225
Come on already!

10:16.315 --> 10:17.658
You always thought,

10:17.783 --> 10:20.992
and you still think
you're different from me.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.160
And in a way we are.

10:23.289 --> 10:28.637
You have a nice house in TMR,
a big American car in your garage...

10:28.761 --> 10:31.071
- Nobody gave 'em to me.
- I know.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.667
You worked hard to earn all that.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.275
You even married a Canuck.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.907
- Don't start.
- No, because I'm happy for you.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.510
But let me tell you one thing.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.119
Behind it all,
despite all your dollars

10:48.247 --> 10:53.094
and your cars and your clothes
and all the rest, etc.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.756
Do you know how people here see you?

10:55.855 --> 10:58.131
How they'll always see you?

10:58.257 --> 11:00.498
They'll see you like me.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.667
Exactly like me. Always.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.104
An Italian. A wop.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.803
Enough, it's always the same crap.

11:07.933 --> 11:11.471
The war ended 20 years ago.
Yes or no?

11:12.304 --> 11:13.544
Yes or no?

11:14.640 --> 11:18.178
War never ends. You were born a wop,
you'll die a wop.

11:18.477 --> 11:21.617
Stop. I won't have that word
spoken in my house.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.391
You're absolutely right.

11:28.054 --> 11:33.402
I'm getting old, my son,
and probably soft in the head.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.701
Sorry. Never again.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.866
Just tell me to go to hell.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.568
I should.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.409
But I won't. I'll go smoke
a cigarette, it's better.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.541
Y'know what? I'll tell you anyway.
Go to hell!

11:47.673 --> 11:49.710
Go smoke a cigarette.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.767
WORLD WAR ll.

12:17.837 --> 12:21.216
My talk is on
Canadian hypocrisy during WWII.

12:21.741 --> 12:27.123
May I remind you, this is a history
assignment, not a comedy routine.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.224
Yes, sir.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.349
Fine, I'm listening.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.589
But I advise you to tread carefully.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.968
On Sept. 10, 1939,

12:43.095 --> 12:47.134
Canada declared war on Germany
and its allies, Japan and Italy.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.109
So you were our enemy?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.979
Mr Gagnon!

12:51.103 --> 12:55.609
Another outburst and you'll go see
the principal. Do you read me?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.111
Continue, Mr Corbo.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.653
Canada claims it's fighting
for freedom and democracy.

13:05.785 --> 13:10.564
But two years later it arbitrarily
begins jailing Canadians

13:10.656 --> 13:13.068
of German, Japanese
and Italian origin

13:13.159 --> 13:15.799
as so-called enemy aliens.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.101
On June 10, 1941,

13:18.230 --> 13:21.404
my father Nicola Corbo
and his father Achille,

13:21.500 --> 13:23.844
like hundreds of other Italians,

13:23.969 --> 13:27.314
were arrested and sent
to a concentration camp.

13:27.439 --> 13:28.474
Mr Corbo!

13:28.607 --> 13:31.520
I don't think this subject
is suitable.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.681
Do you have another topic?

13:34.280 --> 13:35.759
Why isn't it suitable?

13:35.848 --> 13:39.523
Certain subjects
shouldn't be discussed in public.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.690
I won't let you humiliate
your family here.

13:43.189 --> 13:47.001
These are facts as documented
by my father and grandfather.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.840
Facts not yet pan of
official history.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.368
The defeated never write
their own history.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.775
Even I know that.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.677
You've 15 seconds
to start a new topic

14:00.806 --> 14:03.184
or we move on and you get an F.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.627
They spent two years in the camps.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.218
- Out!
- They lost everything.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.161
Out! Leave my class immediately!

14:51.090 --> 14:52.899
What happened this time?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.603
You know what happened.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.006
Did you ever consider

15:01.100 --> 15:04.673
that Grandpa and I
don't want people to know?

15:05.170 --> 15:07.616
That we're not proud
we went to jail?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.744
No, but why pretend
it didn't happen?

15:10.876 --> 15:13.049
I don't pretend
it didn't happen, Jean.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.681
I've turned the page.

15:15.781 --> 15:18.921
If you had,
you wouldn't react like this.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.394
But I say it in school...

15:21.520 --> 15:23.591
Exactly, you're in school.

15:23.722 --> 15:27.295
One that was generous enough
to take you mid-year

15:27.426 --> 15:30.771
because you got thrown out
of the last one.

15:31.597 --> 15:36.478
When your teacher tells you
to do something, you do <i>as</i> he says!

15:36.602 --> 15:39.708
Why go to school
if it's to learn to be a slave?

15:43.275 --> 15:47.155
Stay in your room.
I don't want to see your face.

15:51.984 --> 15:54.988
<i>And don't let me hear
your jungle music!</i>

16:04.596 --> 16:08.840
APRIL 1966

16:34.093 --> 16:35.037
Good luck.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.537
Farewell.

17:02.654 --> 17:05.794
- That could never happen here.
- Why not?

17:06.992 --> 17:10.132
I don't know.
I'm not sure we'd go that far.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.836
Who's that?

17:19.738 --> 17:21.183
See you at home, OK?

17:24.510 --> 17:26.353
Introduce me, next time.

18:41.987 --> 18:43.557
Can I help you?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.335
I saw you at the cinema.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.008
I wanted to talk to you.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.579
I read your newsletter, The Ax.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.477
It's really interesting.

19:01.573 --> 19:04.019
I don't have time to talk now.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.747
OK.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.456
There's an MLP workshop tomorrow.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.300
- Come, it's not far from here.
- OK.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.305
By the way, my name's Jean.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.505
I'm Julie.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.722
- Someone has to go check.
- You crazy?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.225
It can blow any minute.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.461
Exactly.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.037
Shit.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.707
Gimme that!

21:20.779 --> 21:22.315
Shit!

22:37.656 --> 22:39.294
Have you heard of the MLP?

22:40.992 --> 22:44.530
- The People's Liberation Movement?
- I think so.

22:45.497 --> 22:46.908
Yeah.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.703
They're ML-ers.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.003
ML-ers?

22:53.472 --> 22:55.076
Marxist-Leninists.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.252
The gang from Parti <i>Pris</i> magazine.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.084
They target scabs,

23:01.813 --> 23:04.851
march on picket lines,
stuff like that.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.525
Why'?

23:10.989 --> 23:13.265
Someone at school mentioned them.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.207
You're making friends there?

23:18.997 --> 23:20.601
Yeah.

23:21.099 --> 23:22.578
That's great!

23:24.403 --> 23:27.407
BOMB EXPLODES IN LAFONTAINE PARK

23:29.341 --> 23:32.515
Fanon says that the colonized

23:32.611 --> 23:35.353
remain marked by their ties
to the colonizer.

23:36.214 --> 23:39.752
Psychologically,
they'll always feel inferior,

23:39.885 --> 23:43.230
even if the colonizer
passes laws

23:43.355 --> 23:45.767
to free or liberate them.

23:48.894 --> 23:53.866
To take a concrete example,
think of American Negro slaves.

23:55.233 --> 23:59.545
Legally, they were objects
belonging to their white owners.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.948
They had no rights, no last name.

24:02.073 --> 24:04.075
- Did I miss much?
- Just started.

24:04.209 --> 24:08.055
When they were freed,
they had to choose a name.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.622
- Ready?
- Yeah.

24:12.217 --> 24:16.723
<i>Believe it or not, most slaves
chose their former owner's name</i>

24:16.822 --> 24:18.927
<i>and to remain in his service.</i>

24:19.057 --> 24:20.661
<i>Legally, they were free,</i>

24:20.792 --> 24:23.671
<i>but psychologically
they felt inferior.</i>

24:23.728 --> 24:25.332
Let's go.

24:26.998 --> 24:28.443
598...

24:34.306 --> 24:37.412
This is where Fanon
gets really interesting.

24:37.509 --> 24:40.615
He concludes
there's one way, just one,

24:40.745 --> 24:44.318
for the colonized
to stop feeling inferior

24:44.449 --> 24:46.292
and regain their real identity.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.194
And that way is violence.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.759
Hello, Mr Johnson?

24:52.757 --> 24:55.499
I'm calling to talk to you
about the RIN.

24:55.627 --> 24:58.801
Yes, the Rally
for National Independence.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.346
Mr Johnson?

25:05.470 --> 25:06.881
He hung I-IP-

25:08.773 --> 25:10.309
Great start.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.011
Write it down.

25:12.444 --> 25:16.324
By an act of violence
toward the colonizer,

25:16.448 --> 25:21.193
the colonized must regain
their own freedom and identity.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.231
That's the only way

25:26.224 --> 25:30.172
for the colonized
to fully liberate themselves.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.066
Yes, sir, I understand.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.539
I understand perfectly.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.848
That's right. OK.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.643
Have a good night.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.546
Next.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.826
522...

25:56.488 --> 25:58.399
0079.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.075
- What's the name?
- Kate Ford.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.186
Yes, hello. Mme Ford, please.

26:19.911 --> 26:24.587
Good evening. I'm calling
to talk to you about the RIN, the...

26:27.218 --> 26:31.030
No, madame. I'll speak to you
in French or not at all.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.570
- You hung up?
- There are limits, dammit!

26:39.898 --> 26:42.401
- So, it's a no?
- What do you think?

26:52.477 --> 26:53.979
<i>Jean!</i>

26:55.547 --> 26:57.754
- <i>What'?</i>
- <i>You ready?</i>

27:16.234 --> 27:19.477
Smile, Jean. This isn't a funeral.

27:19.604 --> 27:23.643
You wanted me to come. I came.
That's as much as I can do.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.828
Nic!

27:44.496 --> 27:46.806
- Grateful you came!
- Congratulations!

27:46.931 --> 27:48.205
Thanks!

27:48.333 --> 27:50.142
Giovanni! How are you?

27:50.268 --> 27:51.770
Good, and you?

27:51.870 --> 27:56.842
Great. Look, Marco must be somewhere
with the other kids.

27:57.108 --> 28:00.180
Go find them.
They'll be glad to see you.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.216
Jean!

28:10.055 --> 28:12.296
I'll pick you up at 11:30.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.458
<i>OK'?</i>

30:08.506 --> 30:11.487
<i>We fight with the FLQ</i>

30:12.644 --> 30:15.488
<i>to establish
a revolutionary government.</i>

30:18.583 --> 30:23.498
<i>We have taken up arms
to attain our political objectives:</i>

30:24.589 --> 30:27.661
<i>Decolonization
and national independence.</i>

30:29.961 --> 30:32.373
<i>We are fighting for our liberation.</i>

30:34.599 --> 30:36.135
<i>One thing is certain:</i>

30:37.001 --> 30:38.947
<i>We are preparing for war.</i>

30:40.605 --> 30:43.984
Those who believe Quebec
<i>will</i> achieve independence

30:44.108 --> 30:46.019
<i>without firing a shot</i>

30:46.778 --> 30:49.190
<i>are deluding themselves.</i>

30:50.381 --> 30:52.987
<i>Those who fear the enemy's attacks</i>

30:53.117 --> 30:57.725
<i>and think they can avoid legal
reprisals and police repression...</i>

30:58.122 --> 31:02.969
<i>They should put on their slippers
and doze in front of the TV</i>

31:03.995 --> 31:06.339
<i>or go for a beer a! The tavern.</i>

31:07.232 --> 31:12.477
<i>Let them not think they have a place
in the revolutionary struggle.</i>

31:19.577 --> 31:23.320
<i>Our political beliefs
derive from a basic principle:</i>

31:24.515 --> 31:28.861
<i>We are preparing for war.
Every one of us.</i>

31:30.021 --> 31:32.092
<i>We will fight to the end.</i>

32:17.535 --> 32:19.037
Working hard?

32:20.738 --> 32:22.274
Yeah.

32:22.573 --> 32:25.076
Not my choice,
I have to help my dad.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.225
Your dad owns the restaurant?

32:36.921 --> 32:38.264
What does he do?

32:42.260 --> 32:44.297
He hasn't worked in three years.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.002
How come?

32:46.230 --> 32:48.972
He tried to unionize
his old factory.

32:50.601 --> 32:55.277
When the foremen found out,
they fired everyone involved.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.520
Now no one'll hire him.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.186
Scared he'll start a union.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.663
So Mom cleans houses,
and I work here.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.045
Don't you work?

33:28.172 --> 33:29.776
Lucky.

33:34.612 --> 33:37.024
Why are you dressed like that?

33:39.550 --> 33:44.158
I was at a birthday party
for the son of a friend of my dad.

33:45.890 --> 33:49.030
A party for the son
of a friend of your dad?

33:51.029 --> 33:54.841
My dad wanted me there.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.143
Not my choice either.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.215
Why's that?

34:02.240 --> 34:03.651
For appearances.

34:04.675 --> 34:08.679
So the family's seen
as pan of the community.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.891
- What does your dad do?
- He's a lawyer.

34:15.152 --> 34:19.659
He's also involved in politics.
He campaigns for the Liberals.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.204
Yeah, I know.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.782
Hi.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.744
Can I speak to you?

34:40.277 --> 34:41.848
Why's he here?

34:43.014 --> 34:45.858
He was passing by.
He just wanted to talk.

34:46.684 --> 34:48.094
What do we do with this?

34:51.522 --> 34:52.967
We bring him along.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.108
Aren't they on strike?

35:06.237 --> 35:08.046
Yeah, a year now.

35:08.139 --> 35:11.643
The owner hired scabs
and stopped negotiating.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.088
- Julie'?
- Yes.

35:15.213 --> 35:18.751
Stand over there,
make sure nobody comes.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.996
You stay here.
Watch the other way.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.062
You see anybody, whistle.

36:11.035 --> 36:11.843
Francois!

36:13.771 --> 36:14.875
Down there!

36:15.439 --> 36:17.476
- What'?
- The cops drove by.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.073
- What are you doing?
- Helping you finish.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.411
They're coming!

37:43.728 --> 37:45.139
You've got balls.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.332
So, how was it?

38:18.329 --> 38:19.808
Fa mastic.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.380
Hi.

39:01.472 --> 39:02.849
Hi.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.543
Just a sec.

39:20.624 --> 39:24.037
- You have to choose a pseudonym.
- Why'?

39:24.995 --> 39:27.066
You can't use your real name.

39:27.832 --> 39:29.971
OK, but what are your pseudonyms?

39:31.535 --> 39:34.414
Julie and Francois
aren't our real names.

39:35.239 --> 39:36.650
They're not?

39:59.230 --> 40:00.573
Come in.

40:12.209 --> 40:13.552
Have a seat.

40:45.075 --> 40:46.053
Now what?

40:48.078 --> 40:49.455
Nothing.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.425
We just have to wait.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.033
I'm Mathieu.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.302
I'm Dannick.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.836
You're at a private school?

41:42.933 --> 41:45.937
Yeah, my parents are adamant
I go there.

41:49.306 --> 41:51.286
Where do you live, Dannick?

41:53.110 --> 41:54.384
Town of Mount Royal.

41:59.984 --> 42:01.861
Your family must be loaded.

42:08.325 --> 42:12.364
What's a kid from TMR doing here?

42:15.699 --> 42:18.236
I live in the same world as you.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.178
I don't think so.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.652
You obviously didn't grow up
in a slum like me.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.485
I'm not blind.

42:29.580 --> 42:33.494
The rich live off the poor,
exploited and humiliated.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.865
And the poor and exploited
and humiliated...

42:40.357 --> 42:42.598
What are you willing to do for them?

42:45.429 --> 42:47.500
I don't know what I can do.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.604
But I know
I can stand alongside them

42:51.735 --> 42:54.511
when they decide
to stand up for themselves.

42:55.506 --> 42:59.044
If you say I don't belong here,
I'll try somewhere else.

43:00.044 --> 43:02.046
But since I met these two,

43:05.015 --> 43:09.259
I know it's guys like you
who'll bring real change to Québec.

43:19.563 --> 43:23.375
It's rare that people from TMR
come see us.

43:24.735 --> 43:26.078
A nice change.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.250
Welcome, Dannick.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.900
Come in.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.480
Alain, this is Dannick.

44:01.605 --> 44:04.245
He'll hand out The Ax with us.

44:05.009 --> 44:06.920
- Hey, Dannick.
- Hi.

44:07.011 --> 44:10.458
I'm almost done printing.
Have a seat.

44:14.785 --> 44:17.766
- What's up?
- I have to speak to Jacques.

44:29.533 --> 44:31.672
I'll get you at lunchtime.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.023
<i>Jean?</i>

45:17.347 --> 45:18.826
What?

45:19.583 --> 45:22.189
Want to help me distribute these?

45:25.022 --> 45:26.763
It's the RIN's platform.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.563
100 YEARS OF INJUSTICE

45:29.026 --> 45:32.007
Sorry, I can't. I have homework.

45:32.096 --> 45:33.598
That's alright.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.442
- Another time?
- Sure!

46:24.047 --> 46:28.291
MAY 1966

47:07.291 --> 47:08.531
He's here.

47:20.604 --> 47:22.345
Where are we going?

47:22.472 --> 47:24.850
If you need to know,
they'll say.

47:55.138 --> 47:57.482
- Where's Alain?
- Watching the truck.

48:00.244 --> 48:02.485
Grab a shovel and help.

48:18.662 --> 48:20.369
Don't dig too hard.

48:20.497 --> 48:24.877
If it blows, there'll be body pans
two miles around.

50:42.873 --> 50:45.581
Why's it always
so complicated with you?

50:47.544 --> 50:50.150
What if your mom hadn't noticed?

50:51.815 --> 50:55.490
You'd have gone to school like that?
To get expelled?

50:57.087 --> 50:59.431
- It's not that.
- Oh no?

51:00.490 --> 51:03.369
Then explain,
'cause I don't understand.

51:05.562 --> 51:09.738
You haven't understood me for ages.
It's nothing new.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.775
What don't I understand?

51:12.769 --> 51:14.442
What are you lacking?

51:17.374 --> 51:21.413
You have a roof over your head,
you eat three times a day,

51:21.545 --> 51:23.786
attend the best schools in Québec.

51:23.914 --> 51:26.690
You don't realize,
but you have it all!

51:27.117 --> 51:30.587
Your life on a silver platter.
What's missing?

51:30.921 --> 51:34.960
I don't want your life
or your silver platter. Keep 'em.

51:40.464 --> 51:43.274
Go on, spit on me.
Do it to my face.

51:45.635 --> 51:48.548
You've contempt for all I give you.

51:48.638 --> 51:50.743
Any contempt comes from you.

51:52.142 --> 51:54.486
Contempt? What do you mean?

51:55.412 --> 51:59.952
Sweating to ensure my sons' future?
If so, yes, I have contempt.

52:00.083 --> 52:03.155
No, it's refusing to see
your sons aren't you.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.630
What do you know about us? Nothing!

52:05.755 --> 52:09.601
You're too busy making us
lead a life we don't want.

52:09.726 --> 52:12.935
We're not like you.
Put that in your head!

52:21.938 --> 52:23.645
You should be ashamed!

52:52.035 --> 52:54.447
It's not Verdi or Donizetti, but...

52:55.705 --> 52:58.709
The music you listen to
is beautiful.

53:00.343 --> 53:01.651
I like it.

53:04.314 --> 53:05.657
Lovely.

53:11.888 --> 53:14.869
You know, Giova...

53:16.293 --> 53:17.567
Music...

53:18.361 --> 53:20.739
everyone listens with their ears.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.742
But you have to feel it
with your heart.

53:27.904 --> 53:29.474
With your soul.

53:32.075 --> 53:36.217
<i>You're so passionate.</i>

53:36.346 --> 53:38.826
<i>You invest yourself body and soul.</i>

53:39.716 --> 53:41.218
<i>Good for you.</i>

53:42.085 --> 53:43.587
<i>Bravo.</i>

53:48.658 --> 53:50.035
When she was alive,

53:51.861 --> 53:53.568
your nonna Amalia...

53:54.664 --> 53:56.940
at times I would get so upset.

53:59.336 --> 54:04.342
I wanted to give my opinions
about certain things.

54:06.710 --> 54:09.782
But she'd shut me up and say,

54:10.513 --> 54:13.790
"Stop making a scene for nothing."

54:14.284 --> 54:16.764
For a yes, for a no.

54:17.187 --> 54:21.431
"You're just a grumpy old fart."

54:24.694 --> 54:28.198
And me, what did I do?
I calmed down.

54:29.699 --> 54:32.976
I loved her.
I didn't want to upset her.

54:34.971 --> 54:36.575
And I bit my tongue.

54:38.808 --> 54:40.412
I bit my tongue.

54:44.614 --> 54:48.255
If she were still alive,
if she were here...

54:50.253 --> 54:52.824
know what I'd tell her, Giova?

54:56.760 --> 54:58.296
That a man

54:59.396 --> 55:02.309
has to fight for his opinions.

55:02.432 --> 55:05.572
A man should get angry.

55:05.935 --> 55:08.415
He should open his mind

55:09.906 --> 55:14.252
and let out everything that's
in there, everything he thinks.

55:17.947 --> 55:22.919
Otherwise you're fighting
against yourself.

55:26.289 --> 55:28.030
That's what I'd tell her

55:29.993 --> 55:32.030
if she were still alive.

55:37.434 --> 55:39.812
<i>But it's too late now, Giova...</i>

55:41.671 --> 55:43.048
<i>Too late.</i>

57:12.128 --> 57:13.232
Ready?

57:13.730 --> 57:15.141
Yeah.

57:35.585 --> 57:37.121
You've 20 minutes.

57:39.322 --> 57:40.392
Make it quick.

57:40.990 --> 57:42.469
Got it.

58:18.127 --> 58:19.538
It's a return.

58:32.942 --> 58:36.048
- Who from?
- My boss will call you.

58:36.179 --> 58:37.715
He'll explain.

59:20.990 --> 59:22.697
Go, go.

59:35.371 --> 59:37.783
Mme Morin, the parcel.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.249
Come on!

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:22.120
- <i>Lagrenade?</i>
- <i>There's a bomb in the factory.</i>

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:25.164
You've 3 minutes to evacuate
before it blows!

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.663
This isn't our first bomb threat.

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.737
<i>No way I'm falling for it.</i>

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:33.902
No, listen!

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:35.305
<i>There really is...</i>

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:43.845
What?

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.850
He won't evacuate.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.477
Christ!

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.647
What do we do?

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:56.794
Madame Morin, take over.
I can't spend all day on the phone.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:22.212
<i>I'm here m The Ax.</i>

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.410
Wait a sec.

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.954
Here.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.255
Everything OK?

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:42.860
Could be better.

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:54.480
BOMB <i>m</i> LAGRENADE SHOE FACTORY
THERESE MORIN, 64, DIES.

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.247
You're sure it was him?

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.093
Those crates we dug up...

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.460
What else was it for?

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.909
Why didn't he tell me?

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:13.955
<i>The peasant,
the underprivileged, the starving</i>

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:20.690
<i>are the exploited who soon discover
that violence alone pays.</i>

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:28.369
<i>For them there is no compromise,
no possibility of concession.</i>

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:35.213
<i>Colonization or decolonization:
It is simply a power struggle.</i>

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:40.150
<i>Non-violence is an attempt
to settle the colonial problem</i>

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:45.556
<i>before any bloodshed or
regrettable act is committed.</i>

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:52.527
<i>The exploited realize that
liberation requires every means</i> -

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.396
<i>and force first.</i>

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:59.164
<i>Colonialism is not a machine
capable of thinking,</i>

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.173
<i>a body endowed with reason.</i>

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.708
<i>I! Is naked violence</i>

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:07.212
<i>and gives in only
when faced with greater violence.</i>

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:15.421
Look, we should take a break.

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.546
- See what...
- Come on!

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.593
We have to act, and fast!
We can't back down now.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:23.253
We're militants,
not murderers dammit!

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.423
Sorry, activism won't cut it.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.362
Protests are fine,

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:31.097
but we need concrete action
to decolonize Quebec.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.400
The shoe factory -
that was concrete action.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.634
I'm all for concrete.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.112
- Not for killing innocent people.
- Cut the offended virgin crap!

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.113
We have to accept that this happens.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:49.253
Or we go home
and forget the whole thing.

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:55.225
Violence isn't a choice.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:59.124
It's our only option.

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:05.137
For 200 years
we've been trampled upon.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.403
Either we let them, like
we've always done, and disappear,

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.140
or stand up
and show the world we exist.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:17.513
- We're talking, Mathieu.
- We've talked enough!

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.814
It's time for action.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:27.650
We fight this war to the end,
or we don't fight it at all, Alain.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.962
Choose your side.

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:54.850
OK.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.722
If everyone agrees,

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.562
we keep going.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:23.648
DOMINION TEXTILE ON STRIKE

<i>If I! Wins those three ridings,</i>

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.891
<i>the Union Nationale
will form the government.</i>

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.585
- Like that?
- Perfect.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.061
Don't touch it or we'll lose it.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.697
<i>“From Union Nationale HQ.</i>

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.269
- <i>Hello, Mr Johnson.</i>
- <i>Hello.</i>

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:48.239
<i>Your party is not expected to obtain
a majority of votes in Quebec.</i>

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:51.743
<i>Do you see this victory
as incomplete?</i>

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:54.211
<i>Of course this is nothing new.</i>

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:57.510
<i>Obviously with all the votes...</i>

01:07:57.606 --> 01:08:01.213
<i>the Anglophone vote in Montréal,</i>

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:04.790
<i>the Jewish vote in Montréal,</i>

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:08.259
<i>all that is no! French Canadian...</i>

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:12.232
<i>They voted against
the Union Nationals</i>

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:14.129
<i>and for the Liberals.</i>

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:18.363
If you're not French Canadian,
you don't count.

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:21.067
- We've gone backwards.
- 30 years.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:26.578
<i>And with those words
we end our election night coverage.</i>

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:29.376
<i>51 Liberals were elected,</i>

01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:32.578
<i>54 Union Nationale MLAs...</i>

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:36.814
<i>None from the Ralliement National,
none for the RIN.</i>

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.550
Not surprising.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.283
Why is that?

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:45.261
People realize that politics
gets you nowhere.

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.096
Pardon?

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:52.234
People who want real change
don't waste their time voting.

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:56.134
Sorry, but if Bourgault
had been elected,

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.643
he'd have brought change to Québec.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:02.237
Not one RIN candidate was elected.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:05.011
Bourgault didn't even win
his own riding.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.348
What did voting RIN accomplish?

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.872
<i>The results of this election</i>

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.670
<i>will make lots of people
think twice.</i>

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:35.274
<i>Progressives who'd hoped
to change things politically</i>

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:37.112
<i>will be disillusioned.</i>

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:41.019
<i>They'll realize
the sterility of their actions.</i>

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:47.995
<i>Politics never got Québec anywhere.
That's not about to change.</i>

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:53.356
There's one thing
that can achieve

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:56.732
national liberation
and decolonization for Québec

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:01.299
and that's
a revolutionary avant-garde

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:04.674
refusing to act
within established structures.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.018
When the minute hand

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.590
touches the nail,

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:27.331
it closes the circuit
and sends power to the detonator,

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.067
causing it to explode.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.236
Usually I'd put the nail at 11.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.405
So when the minute hands on 12,

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:42.414
you've 55 minutes till it blows,
plenty of time to get away.

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:45.345
That revolutionary avant-garde

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:49.513
is you.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.684
You're the spark plug.

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:57.391
Your role is to help Quebecers
put into words

01:10:57.519 --> 01:11:00.898
and one day act on the gut anger

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.367
that they're not yet able
to intellectualize.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:11.734
<i>Don't believe those who say
this battle can be won by elections.</i>

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:19.282
Lee-Enfields,
Canadian Army assault rifles.

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:25.957
Nice of them to lend us these
for our demonstration.

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:33.155
The rest of you, come here.

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:37.994
<i>Each day Québec workers
awaken a bit more to reality:</i>

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.804
<i>We're colonized politically,
socially, economically.</i>

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:46.612
303s. Not very common,
but you'll get the idea.

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:50.682
<i>Knowing we're colonized
isn't enough anymore.</i>

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:53.649
<i>We have to make people see that.</i>

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:59.589
<i>The real question is:</i>

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:02.822
<i>How far are we willing to go
to make things change?</i>

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:32.956
<i>The masses must realize
it's up to them.</i>

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:35.460
<i>If we stagnate,
it's their fault.</i>

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:38.555
<i>And if we advance,
it's still their fault.</i>

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:05.655
<i>Those who think Quebecers
aren't radical enough...</i>

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.352
Come on.

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:10.828
<i>That the masses
won't follow revolutionaries</i>

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:13.559
<i>intent on crushing the oppressor...</i>

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:16.734
<i>They don't understand
today's Québec.</i>

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.202
Shit.

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:35.246
<i>By channeling the violence
deep inside every Quebecer,</i>

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:39.689
<i>we can confront and destroy for good
the colonial system</i>

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:42.285
<i>that's smothered us for centuries.</i>

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.051
Jacques wants us.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.598
Scout the area first,
look for the best spot.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:28.604
It has to be near the factory,
but not too far.

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.937
We don't want anyone there.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.811
What do we look for
when we get there?

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.507
What's a good spot?

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:40.744
You'll look after Jean
while we're away'?

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.659
- I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.030
- For sure'?
- Yes!

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.995
He can look after himself.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.673
Hi.

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.386
- <i>Bon appétit.</i>
- <i>Thanks.</i>

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:21.952
So, did you have a nice weekend?

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.026
Yeah, it was fun.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.198
Did you thank Pierre's parents?

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.358
Don't worry, Mom.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:33.496
Next time invite him here.

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.472
You always visit him.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:38.044
Fine, I will.

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:40.812
I'll go unpack.

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:00.726
There are two guards.

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:05.763
Wait.

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:33.826
We're good.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.403
What are you doing?

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.698
Francois!

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:47.423
Why's that here?

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.925
<i>I dunno.</i>

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.604
What do you think?

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:29.974
Why not?

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:33.112
Francois?

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.539
Do what you want.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.211
But count me out.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.153
Why'?

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:51.287
I can't.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.261
Not after Lagrenade.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.558
It's different here.

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:59.138
That was inside the factory
in daytime.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.764
We're outside, at night, to be safe.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:04.236
We thought Lagrenade was safe too.

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.279
Francois!

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.625
Take care of yourselves.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.199
Why aren't you asleep?

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.369
No special reason.

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:27.582
Is summer vacation
making you nervous?

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:41.398
When I was your age,
summers weren't like they are today.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.399
We had to work.

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:51.838
It wasn't easy.
Grandpa didn't have much money.

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.608
He paid so I could go to school.

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:59.978
He worked himself to the bone.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:05.584
But my summers belonged to him.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.991
I helped at his store.

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:13.328
It can't have been easy.

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.669
No, but...

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:19.638
that's how it was.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.642
We accepted it.

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.285
Grandpa must be proud.

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.658
To see what you've become.

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.697
I guess so.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.799
Though he'll never say it.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:57.237
But I think he is.
I think he's proud of his kids.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.377
Like I'll be proud of mine.

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:05.007
Yeah.

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:35.003
Jean?

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:43.579
- No wild stuff while we're away.
- Don't worry, Mom.

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:48.585
You grow up so fast.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.788
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:08.142
- OK, ciao. See you soon?
- Yeah.

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.941
Listen to your brother
while we're away.

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:14.280
OK, Dad.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.795
<i>You were talking about
the ministers...</i>

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.995
<i>the ministers
of Finance and Commerce.</i>

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:06.434
JULY 1966

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:10.670
<i>Historically, French Canadians
have never held either position.</i>

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.800
<i>No, we didn't get our share,</i>

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:16.780
<i>but from what I've heard,
we were partly to blame.</i>

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:19.784
<i>People were offered
those ministries,</i>

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:23.117
<i>but were afraid
of the heavy responsibility.</i>

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:25.521
One weakness we had

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:29.117
<i>is we suffered from
a bad inferiority complex.</i>

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:30.890
<i>I think that's over.</i>

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:34.125
<i>We mustn't develop
a superiority complex,</i>

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.031
<i>that would be no better.</i>

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:41.797
<i>But do you have the impression
that those major, key ministries...</i>

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:12.228
Hello?

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.602
No, it's fine.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.249
Tonight?

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:31.021
Yeah, we'll be there.

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:32.955
Yeah.

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:36.595
That's fine.

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:45.597
TOMORROW WILL BE TOO LATE

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.658
Why not hide it too?

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:55.506
You have a stack of them
under your bed.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.807
I want to read it first.

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.609
Where'd you get that?

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:09.683
I found it at school.

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:16.484
Jean?

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.322
You can talk to me.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:20.493
We'll talk later.

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:22.724
I have things to do.

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:25.463
- Where are you going?
- Don't boss me!

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.234
- I just want to know.
- Butt out!

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:21.550
When will you be done?

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:24.720
I'm not sure.

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.560
I have to work tonight.

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:32.594
We're meeting with Jacques.
He's expecting us.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:37.967
I can't leave now.

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:42.746
You can come later.

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.288
I'm not coming.

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:55.886
If there's a problem...

01:30:55.983 --> 01:31:00.398
If there's a problem
we can at least say that we fought,

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.495
we didn't bow down.

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:09.473
I can't.

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:12.509
I can't do it.

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:15.777
Louise!

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.746
We need you in here!

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.250
Two minutes!

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.355
Louise?

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.950
Strange to hear that.

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.639
I better go back.

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:58.355
Jacques can find someone else.

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:01.456
You don't have to do it.

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:06.495
<i>I dunno.</i>

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:12.334
If I don't show I'm serious

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:14.836
to Jacques and Mathieu,

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:19.871
they'll think
I'm a spoiled TMR brat.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:24.081
I don't mind the spoiled TMR brat.

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.589
I'll drop by tomorrow

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:41.924
to tell you how it went.

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:42.559
Dammit.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.501
There.

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.875
You remember how it works?

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.483
Yeah.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.176
When I attach them,

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.187
you have 55 minutes till it blows.

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:47.891
Understand?

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.460
Yeah.

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.702
That's it.

01:35:07.501 --> 01:35:08.878
I'll wait here.

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:59.745
O <i>cool night.</i>

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.814
<i>Transparent night</i>

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:06.611
<i>Mystery.</i>

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:10.722
<i>Without darkness.</i>

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:18.085
<i>Life is black.</i>

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:22.667
<i>And all-devouring.</i>

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:27.431
O <i>cool night.</i>

01:39:27.594 --> 01:39:32.737
<i>Transparent night</i>

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.403
<i>Give me.</i>

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:40.609
Your serenity.

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:57.258
<i>O lovely night</i>

01:39:57.424 --> 01:40:01.304
<i>Starlit night.</i>

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:05.274
<i>You gaze down.</i>

01:40:05.432 --> 01:40:09.107
<i>Upon me.</i>

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:15.718
<i>Shine your light.</i>

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:19.119
<i>On my troubled soul.</i>

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:23.557
<i>O lovely night</i>

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:27.995
<i>Starlit night.</i>

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:31.864
<i>Light up my thoughts.</i>

01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:35.701
<i>With your smile.</i>

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:51.556
O <i>holy night.</i>

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:56.320
<i>Night without words.</i>

01:40:56.483 --> 01:41:02.434
<i>Full of peace and gentleness.</i>

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:10.402
<i>My heart is seething.</i>

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:13.773
<i>Like a cauldron.</i>

01:41:13.934 --> 01:41:18.178
O <i>holy night.</i>

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:23.083
<i>Night without words.</i>

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:27.214
<i>Bring silence.</i>

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:31.295
<i>To my heart.</i>

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:39.561
O <i>vast night.</i>

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:44.732
<i>Solemn night</i>

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:47.435
<i>Where all things.</i>

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:53.574
<i>Give delight.</i>

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:59.280
<i>Take my whole being.</i>

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:05.294
<i>Under your wing.</i>

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:10.458
O <i>vast night.</i>

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:16.597
<i>Solemn night</i>

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:17.477
<i>Pour sleep.</i>

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:28.609
<i>Into my eyes.</i>

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:48.698
Lieutenant.

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:23.453
FLQ RISES FROM ITS ASHES

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.824
VICTIM IDENTIFIED

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:56.150
I can't go on.

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.022
I can't live with this.

01:46:03.824 --> 01:46:05.360
We have to stop.

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:15.304
We have to stop. Now!

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:40.365
We don't have the right to.

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:41.996
Bullshit, Mathieu!

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:45.908
It's wrong. We can't keep on!

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:48.403
Not after what happened, Jacques.

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:49.843
Not now.

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:52.678
Come on,
it's clear we have to stop!

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:56.252
We're sending kids
to their death, dammit.

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.388
How much lower can we go?

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:03.087
The war we're waging

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:05.747
is more important
than us individually.

01:48:07.747 --> 01:48:10.193
He won't be the last to die.

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:18.863
If you can't live with that,

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:22.865
you've no place here.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.533
<i>Message to the Corbo family.</i>

01:49:30.564 --> 01:49:33.670
<i>Now that the papers, TV and radio</i>

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:37.840
<i>have stopped gorging themselves
on the death of your son,</i>

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:41.510
<i>now that minds are calmer,</i>

01:49:42.576 --> 01:49:45.182
<i>we dare ask your forgiveness
in his name</i>

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:48.953
<i>for believing too strongly
in freedom and decency.</i>

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:56.299
<i>For it was not the pontiffs
of separatism who killed him,</i>

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.702
<i>but the parasites
of the working class</i>

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:01.398
<i>and those responsible
for our decline.</i>

01:50:03.697 --> 01:50:06.371
<i>We are the unwanted tenants
of a country</i>

01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:08.412
<i>that does no! Belong to us,</i>

01:50:08.535 --> 01:50:12.073
<i>where the demand to live
in our language is a crime,</i>

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:16.119
<i>where each mus! Exploit
the weaker to succeed,</i>

01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:19.655
<i>where we are condemned
to wither, to give up,</i>

01:50:19.779 --> 01:50:22.055
<i>and to prostitute our will.</i>

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:29.798
<i>For these reasons, no doubt,
Jean grew angry,</i>

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:34.303
<i>with the passion and generosity
that only youth is capable of.</i>

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:36.100
<i>And he acted.</i>

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:43.406
<i>Your son died in battle,
if you will, at age 16,</i>

01:50:43.503 --> 01:50:47.918
<i>when others dream of adventure
and an all-embracing life.</i>

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:54.324
<i>But we had nothing to do with it.
We didn't even know him.</i>

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:58.125
<i>It is not our way
to involve teenagers,</i>

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:03.030
<i>at least not at the stage we are at
in this country which is now yours.</i>

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:09.199
<i>What explanation
can we give you?</i>

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:12.833
<i>Strange, bu! We have very few.</i>

01:51:13.533 --> 01:51:15.479
<i>We fear suggesting any.</i>

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:18.509
<i>We exist, we write, we talk.</i>

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:21.448
<i>We work in silence and then act.</i>

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:24.486
<i>I! Is easy to join the FLQ.</i>

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:28.024
<i>To believe and claim
you're part of it.</i>

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:31.888
<i>A few pals, a cell
of political friends, and then?</i>

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:39.636
<i>Yes. How you mus! Regret it,</i>

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:42.797
<i>as we regret all the Jeans
of this world,</i>

01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:48.476
<i>especially yours,
who is no longer with us,</i>

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:50.479
<i>and for whom we offer you</i>

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:54.143
<i>our humblest
and sincerest sympathies.</i>

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:24.877
You were going Jean Corbo
to meet your fate

01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:27.177
while a subterranean wind

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:30.447
raged and pounded
for years to come

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:33.080
in the funnels of hope.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:38.788
Who will ever untangle death
and the future?

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:58.713
<i>For Roman.</i>
