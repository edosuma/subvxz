WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:08.960
DISTANT SINGING

00:13.960 --> 00:18.960
SINGING CONTINUES

00:20.960 --> 00:22.960
SHE SINGS

00:22.960 --> 00:24.960
Hey.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.960
Hey!

00:26.960 --> 00:29.320
HEY.
Sorry.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.960
SHE CHUCKLES

00:30.960 --> 00:32.320
So sorry.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.960
So, how many films
has Bollywood actually made?

00:34.960 --> 00:39.960
Oh, millions.
But some are not so good.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.480
But you watch those ones anyway?

00:41.480 --> 00:44.480
What, this? This is a classic.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.960
Ruby.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.480
Ruby! Tell him, please.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.960
If I agree with you,
will you both promise to shut up?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.800
Rude.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.960
SHE SINGS

01:02.800 --> 01:04.480
Well?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.960
I make it two more minutes.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.960
They're probably on their way now.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.960
Isn't it time
you released the prisoners?

01:15.960 --> 01:18.960
Yep, I suppose so.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.960
Do you know, extra workload aside,
I've quite enjoyed this.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.320
The power.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.960
Perhaps I missed my calling?

01:25.960 --> 01:28.960
Warden Fonseca has
a nice ring to it.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.320
SHE CHUCKLES

01:30.320 --> 01:31.960
BEEPING

01:31.960 --> 01:35.480
Oh, ask not for who the bell tolls,
it tolls for thee.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.960
One at a time, please.
And just wait.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.960
Pass. You're all free to go.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.320
I recommend you take a shower
immediately, preferably two.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.960
Dr Fonseca...
Oh! That's close enough.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.960
Our patient is stable,
still GCS 3 off sedation.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
With your permission,

02:07.960 --> 02:10.640
I'd like to settle her
in your HDU before I leave?

02:11.960 --> 02:14.800
I'm gonna let Sister Mari
deal with that.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.960
Your work here is done, Mr Hasan.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.960
Guests are like fish,
they go off after three days.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.960
And I'm afraid you're stinking
like a halibut.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.960
Even so... Thank you and goodbye.
I won't shake your hand.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.960
I'm usually the first one here.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.960
But I don't mind the competition.
Indu.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.960
Yeah, I know who you are. I mean...

03:44.960 --> 03:47.960
Hard to miss.
Oh...

03:47.960 --> 03:50.960
That... That's a long time.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.320
I haven't seen you here before?

03:52.320 --> 03:54.960
No, I... I've been away.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.960
Getting out the cobwebs.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.960
Well, your speed is up there,

03:59.960 --> 04:03.960
but you need to put your whole body
into the cross, OK? Like this.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.960
Now you try.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.960
Oh, I would, but, erm... work.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.320
Oh, erm...
Well, there's always tomorrow.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.960
Yeah.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.480
Perfect timing, Dr Walker.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.960
Right, I'll keep this
short and sweet.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.960
Our Nipah encephalitis patient
is stable in HDU.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.480
She's off sedation,
but still unresponsive.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.960
I've let her parents know.
They're coming to see her today,

04:32.960 --> 04:34.960
so can you fetch me
the moment they arrive? Of course.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.960
And what about the rest
of the village?

04:36.960 --> 04:39.960
The outbreak has been controlled.
No further cases.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.800
Our prompt identification of
the virus no doubt helped with that.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.960
Lucky escape.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.960
OK, Dr Walker, you can supervise
Dr Sharma in casualty.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.960
All of life's rich pageant is there,
both human and otherwise.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.960
It will be an experience.
That's exactly what I'm here for.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.320
Thank you. Dr Nair and I
will handle everything else.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.960
I assume there are no questions?
OK, go save some lives.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.960
Don't spend too long
with each patient.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
We assess them,
treat them and move on.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.640
OK, great, exciting.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.320
Yeah, that's one way
of looking at it.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.960
Mrs Balan, I'm Dr Walker.
I understand you had a fall?

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
Mrs Balan?

05:23.960 --> 05:26.960
I'm Doctor Walker. Ruby.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.640
I have to go, the doctor is here.
Tell them to reschedule for 11:00.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.960
Well, if they can't,
then it's next week. OK.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.960
So sorry, doctor. Mia Kaur.
What can I tell you?

05:36.960 --> 05:38.960
I was just introducing myself
to your mother.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.960
It'll probably be quicker
if you talk to me.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.320
She's a little... You know?
I was getting her up this morning

05:45.320 --> 05:47.960
and she could barely walk,
I think the left hip is paining her.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.960
I asked if she fell
and she denies everything, but...

05:50.960 --> 05:52.960
PHONE RINGS
Hi.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.960
I'll call you back. Five minutes.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.960
You're a very busy woman.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.960
Oh, nothing like you, I'm sure.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.960
But it would be so helpful
if we could move this along.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.960
Suits me.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.960
Mrs Balan,
do you mind if I examine you?

06:13.160 --> 06:14.960
SHE GASPS

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
This hurts?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
A little. Not much.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.960
You have some bruises here?

06:21.960 --> 06:26.960
Er, like I said, she falls.
I can't be with her all the time.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.960
The house staff are supposed to be
keeping an eye on her,

06:29.960 --> 06:31.000
but you know what it's like.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.960
I'm going to prescribe
some painkillers and order an X-ray.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.960
The X-ray. Will it take long?
Oh, yeah, quite possibly.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.960
But I'm afraid
it's absolutely essential.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.480
So if you wouldn't mind
waiting outside with the others?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.960
Can I help you?
Hi.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.960
They told me to wait.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.960
Outside is traditional.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.960
So... you're back.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.800
Either you can't get enough
of my magnetic personality

07:07.800 --> 07:08.960
or you want something.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.640
DCO let me go.
Breach of terms of service.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.960
I was wondering
if you could talk to them,

07:16.960 --> 07:18.800
maybe explain what happened...

07:18.800 --> 07:19.960
That your unprofessional behaviour

07:19.960 --> 07:22.960
put an entire community at risk
from a deadly virus.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.000
Fine, I get it.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
It was worth a try.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.800
Sorry to... disturb you.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.960
They won't take you back,
no matter what I say.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.960
But I could suggest
an alternative arrangement.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.960
Bobby, come and have some breakfast.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
Eat your mango.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.960
I told you, I don't like them.
You know how much they cost?

08:23.960 --> 08:26.640
50 rupees. That's approximately 50p.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.160
What's that?

08:33.160 --> 08:36.320
On your neck. Let me look.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.960
It's some sort of a rash.
Mum!

08:37.960 --> 08:39.000
How far up does it go?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.480
OK, let's get you seen to.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.640
What?
Erm...

08:52.800 --> 08:55.960
So, according to this rota,
I basically live here.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.480
That's the long and the short of it.
Also, the pay is terrible.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.960
But negotiable?

09:01.960 --> 09:04.960
Well, you could try, I suppose,
but from where I'm sitting,

09:04.960 --> 09:07.960
I'd say your position
was extremely weak.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.960
Or I just walk away?

09:12.960 --> 09:14.960
Close the door on your way out.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
You got me.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.960
So... you've got me.
24 hours a day, it seems.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.960
Lydia, Karishma's parents
are here...

09:27.960 --> 09:30.960
Oh.
Perfect timing, sister.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.960
Mr Hasan is joining our team,
starting immediately.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.320
And seeing as Karishma
is once again his patient,

09:36.320 --> 09:38.480
I'm sure he'd love to help.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.960
Of course. This way, Doctor.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.960
If this is about my bar bill,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.960
I'm absolutely, without fail,
going to bring my wallet tonight.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.320
Your credit's good, Dr Nair.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.960
But if you can help me with
my little problem,

10:28.960 --> 10:31.800
I'll happily wipe
your entire slate clean.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.960
The infection has caused
some damage to her brain.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.960
We're supporting her
while it heals itself.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.320
And, don't worry,
this tube is just to make sure

10:41.320 --> 10:44.800
that she gets enough nutrition
and the water she needs.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.960
My wife made food. We thought
it would be a good idea.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.960
And it smells delicious.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.960
I can give some of this
to some of the other children,

10:55.960 --> 10:58.960
if that's OK with you?
Of course. Thank you.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.640
Doctor, when will she wake up?

11:03.640 --> 11:07.320
Well, it's hard to say.
Everyone's brain is different.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.960
We will monitor her closely,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.960
make sure we take
very good care of her.

11:10.960 --> 11:16.960
And we'll inform you
if there's any progress, I promise.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.960
Thank you for taking such good care
of my daughter, Doctor.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.640
OK, so it's
a generalised macular eruption,

11:30.640 --> 11:32.640
no sign of desquamation,
no vesicles.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.960
Yes, I'd say this was
almost certainly

11:34.960 --> 11:36.000
some kind of viral exanthem.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.960
I'm sorry, I don't understand
a word you're saying.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.960
What's an exanthem?
It's another word for a rash.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.480
So... I brought my son here
concerned that he has a rash,

11:45.480 --> 11:46.960
possibly caused by a deadly virus,

11:46.960 --> 11:49.160
and all you can tell me is that
you think he has a viral rash?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.320
Exanthem.

11:51.320 --> 11:52.960
But, essentially, yes.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.960
And I can assure you
the recent outbreak

11:54.960 --> 11:56.960
has been completely controlled...
How old are you?

11:58.480 --> 12:01.800
23. But I don't see
how that's relevant here.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.320
Also, I'm training to be
a dermatologist...

12:03.320 --> 12:04.960
Look, you seem like
a very nice girl,

12:04.960 --> 12:07.960
but can I talk to someone who's
actually finished their training,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.960
preferably in deadly infectious
diseases?

12:11.960 --> 12:13.160
I'll see what I can do.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.960
They left quickly.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.960
You think they don't care?
I didn't say that.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.800
In some ways, it's worse.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.960
Will they be back tomorrow?
They both need to work.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.960
They'll be back next week,
if they can.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
Then I guess it's up to you and me.
Mm.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.640
You've seen cases like this before.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.960
What do you think?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
Be honest with me.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.960
She's been off sedation for days.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.960
I'd have hoped to see more by now.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.960
Brain trauma is unpredictable.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.800
Sometimes, it takes time.
Months, even years.

13:03.960 --> 13:04.960
I'm sorry.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.960
Well?

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
This is bad.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.000
How bad?
Very bad.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.960
See, Indian bureaucracy's
like a glacier.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.960
It moves slowly,
but you cannot stop it.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.640
And it's as cold as a block of ice.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
You've never had a visa?

13:37.960 --> 13:41.960
It was on my to-do list.
Does the commander-in-chief know?

13:41.960 --> 13:44.960
She's got a hospital to worry about.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
And if she knew, she'd castrate me.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Yeah.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.960
Ram, I need your help.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.960
Utter discretion, your eyes only,
totally Secret Squirrel.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.960
I don't understand the reference
of the squirrel,

14:00.960 --> 14:03.960
but there is a lawyer who I know.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.160
Smart as a whip. He has helped
many people in the past.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.960
If there is a loophole here,
he will find it.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.960
That's what I need.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.320
A wily old fox
who knows how to play the system.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.960
There are no fractures
that I can see.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.960
Hip seems fine,
pelvic bones are intact.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.640
Wonderful.
Hear that, Mum? Nothing broken!

14:25.640 --> 14:27.960
Thank you, Doctor.
We'll get out of your way.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.960
Can I talk to you for a second?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.960
I have some ongoing concerns
about your mother.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.160
We need to work out exactly
why she's falling... I'm sorry.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.960
I'm sure you're very conscientious,
but I have a million things to...

14:40.960 --> 14:44.320
And so I'm going to insist that
we admit her to our ward overnight,

14:44.320 --> 14:46.960
run the necessary tests,
you can collect her tomorrow.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.640
That way, you can get on
with your busy day,

14:48.640 --> 14:51.960
and Bhoomy can get
the care she needs.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.960
Clearly, you know best, Doctor.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.960
Walker. Ruby Walker.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.960
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

15:03.960 --> 15:04.960
SHE SIGHS

15:13.960 --> 15:16.960
So, if you could just
take a look at him for me?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
You're sure it's just
a simple exanthem?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.960
Yes, absolutely.
No doubt in my mind, but...

15:21.960 --> 15:23.960
Then, just run
a standard blood count.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.800
Oh, and get a urine sample.
Sure.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.960
What is it we're actually
looking for? In the urine, I mean?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
Nothing. But we're doing something.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.320
That way, everyone's happy
and you and I can get on with seeing

15:36.320 --> 15:39.960
the rest of Kerala, who are waiting
just outside that door. OK? OK.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.960
Thank you for the advice.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.960
Nimish! Over here.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.960
Greg, let me introduce you
to a very good friend

15:59.960 --> 16:02.960
and a brilliant lawyer,
Nimish Chari.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.960
Nice to meet you.
Nimish.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.960
A word?

16:06.960 --> 16:09.960
Mr McConnell,
if you are about to draw attention

16:09.960 --> 16:11.640
to my youthful appearance,

16:11.640 --> 16:14.960
can I just say that I am not only
the most highly-qualified lawyer

16:14.960 --> 16:19.960
this side of Kochi,
but I am also the most unscrupulous.

16:21.960 --> 16:25.960
This childlike visage hides
the soul of a ruthless killer.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.960
Metaphorically, of course.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.960
OK, I'm in. Let's do it.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.960
So, the tests are completely normal.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.800
All normal?
Yes. Completely fine.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.320
Even the urine test.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.000
What was that looking for, exactly?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.960
Oh, many things.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.960
They are incredibly useful.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.800
So, how do you feel now?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.960
Fine. I've always felt fine.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.960
I was fine this morning,
fine at lunchtime and I'm fine now.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.960
So, what's causing this?

17:09.960 --> 17:12.960
As I said, it's some sort
of viral... Exanthem, yeah.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.960
You mentioned that.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
Well, our doors are always open.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.960
So if Bobby has any more symptoms,
we'd be very happy to see him again.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.960
Great.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.640
Let's go.

17:27.960 --> 17:28.960
Mum?

17:30.960 --> 17:32.160
Mum, come on.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.800
I see your problem.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.960
But can you help me?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.960
I will return in 24 hours
with a 100% fool-proof strategy.

18:09.960 --> 18:10.960
Yeah!

18:11.960 --> 18:16.960
Tell me, do you love India, Greg?
With every bone in my body.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.960
Then you will never leave here.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.960
Not with Nimish Chari
as your lawyer.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
Excellent. The drinks are on me.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.960
What can I get you?
Thank you.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.960
But I never touch alcohol.
It is a sign of moral weakness.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.960
But, please,
don't let my own life choices

18:31.960 --> 18:34.960
stop you from indulging yourself.
Good on you, Nimish.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.800
Why buy a dog and bark yourself?
I'm thinking gin!

18:38.800 --> 18:40.960
You're thinking right!
Teetotaller.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.480
Dr Walker?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.960
I've had a visitor from a Mrs Kaur.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.800
She said you were rude
and unprofessional.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.960
Now, the first I can believe,

18:53.960 --> 18:56.960
but unprofessional doesn't
sound like the doctor I know.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.960
She irritated me.
I shouldn't have let it show.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.960
A skill I've never mastered.
What were you worried about?

19:05.480 --> 19:06.960
Multiple injuries of different ages.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.960
Worsening confusion,
possibly early dementia.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.960
Chronic subdural?
Maybe.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.960
What's definite is her daughter
finds her a burden.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.960
Then I think I better take a look,
don't you?

19:19.640 --> 19:21.960
Can you sit forward, please,
Mrs Balan?

19:21.960 --> 19:23.960
I don't know why
you keep calling me that.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.960
My name is Bhoomy Ambedkar.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.960
Like I said, confused.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.960
AMT three out of ten.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.960
Indeed. But it's unusual
to forget one's own name.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.960
Bhoomy? Can you turn to me, please?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.480
Oh, yeah, look at these
dark patches behind the ears.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.640
And here.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.960
More bruises?
No, I don't think so.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.960
Yep. And here.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.000
And there, see?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.960
Mercury?
Mm.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.960
It's common in the older
skin-lightening preparations.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.960
And with regular use,
the metal builds up inside the body.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.320
But behind the ears,
back of the knees?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.960
Well, even the most careful woman
can miss the tricky spots.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.960
Did you notice the fine tremor?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
No.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.960
Chronic mercury poisoning
also explains the confusion.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.320
So I think we should get
a tox screen done

20:35.320 --> 20:36.960
as soon as possible.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.960
I missed it.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
The tremor, the signals, all of it.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.960
No. No, your instinct told you
something was wrong.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.960
You just needed me
to tell you what it was.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.960
Let's get that tox screen done
and then we can review her tomorrow.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.960
Right.

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
Thanks.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.320
SHE WHISPERS A PRAYER

22:13.800 --> 22:15.960
You're early, Doctor.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.960
Old neurosurgical habit.
Ward rounds at 6am.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.960
Made me into a morning person.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.000
It doesn't work.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.960
The old...

22:25.960 --> 22:27.320
At least, not in my experience.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.960
In fact, I don't think God gets up
till much before noon.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.960
Thank you for your advice.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.960
I'm sorry, Mari, I was just teasing.
It's fine.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.480
Hey.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.160
Keep your head up, OK?

23:01.160 --> 23:03.960
Harder. The hook.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.960
The hook.
Argh!

23:06.960 --> 23:08.640
OK, OK, OK, OK.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.160
You don't fight angry.
OK.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.960
OK? It just makes you vulnerable.
You need to stay calm and clinical.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.960
Watch for the mistake.
Again, head up.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.960
OK, this is boxing, not therapy.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.960
Concentrate.
Yeah.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.960
Again.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.000
OK, OK, OK. Listen, time out.
Same time tomorrow.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.320
No, no, one more time.
I can do it. I can do it.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.960
I can do it!

23:51.960 --> 23:52.960
Oh, wait for the guard to drop.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
Better.

24:10.960 --> 24:11.960
Argh!

24:13.960 --> 24:15.800
Are you OK? Hey...

24:15.800 --> 24:17.960
You all right?
Woo.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.960
You must really hate that guy, huh?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.960
Who says it's a guy?

24:24.960 --> 24:27.960
I mean, there's a lot of people
I want to punch right now.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.320
OK. Good session.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.960
SHE PANTS

24:31.960 --> 24:34.960
Same time tomorrow, yeah?
Yeah, sure.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.960
I'll see you.
OK.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.960
SHE PANTS

24:44.960 --> 24:46.960
HE COUGHS

24:46.960 --> 24:47.960
Hey.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.960
I knew it.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.960
Sister.
Doctor.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.960
I just wanted to apologise
about earlier.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.960
For what it's worth,

25:16.960 --> 25:19.960
I have always believed in
the power of prayer,

25:19.960 --> 25:20.960
but it's easy to forget,

25:20.960 --> 25:22.960
especially when you're facing
your own tests.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.960
I wasn't laughing at you.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.960
Then why did you make a face
like this?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Sometimes, I try and make a joke
about serious things.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.160
I don't know why.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.960
Well, I do know.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.960
It's because
they make me feel uncomfortable.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.480
Always have.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.960
Anyways, I'm sorry.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.800
And this is your official apology.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.960
I don't know whether you're sincere
or just a really good actor.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.960
Actually, I have done some acting.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.320
At medical school.
They had a theatre club.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.640
I was in Loot.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.960
But I am being sincere.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.960
Very sincere.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.960
Look.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
CLEARS THROAT
Apology accepted.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.000
Now, go away and let me do my work.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.960
Sure.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.640
Sorry.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.960
Thank you.
OK.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.960
Good.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.800
Are you OK?

26:51.800 --> 26:52.960
Talk to me.

26:57.960 --> 26:58.960
Can I...?

27:03.960 --> 27:06.640
Ah!
I need an ambulance now.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.960
They attended the casualty
yesterday?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.960
Yes, Doctor Nair.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.960
I thought it was just
a mild viral infection.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
And what did Doctor Walker think?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.960
Did you ask Dr Walker
to take a look at the patient?

27:21.160 --> 27:24.960
Not... Not exactly.
I wasn't concerned at the time.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.960
But his mother is worried about him.

27:28.960 --> 27:29.960
Yes.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.320
Parental instincts
should never be ignored.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.960
Now, we have awakened
a sleeping giant!

27:34.960 --> 27:40.960
Luckily, at least one of us
has both authority and charisma.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.160
Give me your stethoscope.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.960
Watch me.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.960
Say 99.
99.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.960
Now, say 22.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
Whisper it, please.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
WHISPERED: 22.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.960
HE SIGHS

28:11.960 --> 28:13.960
His chest is clear,

28:13.960 --> 28:16.960
but your son has
a mild temperature, Ms Martin.

28:16.960 --> 28:21.960
So we should rule out all
possibilities of an infection here.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.960
A full range of tests,
nothing left to chance.

28:24.960 --> 28:28.960
Dr Sharma, let's get
a chest radiograph,

28:28.960 --> 28:30.960
full hepatic function tests

28:30.960 --> 28:34.960
and a rapid malaria screen.
Yes, Dr Nair.

28:34.960 --> 28:38.960
In the meantime, we shall keep him
under close observation.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.960
Hourly temperatures, please.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.640
Any further questions, Ms Martin?

28:42.640 --> 28:45.960
No, Doctor.
You've been very thorough. Thanks.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.960
Good. And I want to know the test
results as soon as they come in.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.960
Well, what are you waiting for?!

28:57.640 --> 28:58.960
Young doctors!

29:00.480 --> 29:01.960
What have we got?

29:01.960 --> 29:03.960
This is Indu, mid-20s,
suspected ruptured spleen

29:03.960 --> 29:05.960
due to a blunt trauma.
Where did you find her?

29:05.960 --> 29:06.960
In the gym. She owns it.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.960
So she was hit?
Yes.

29:08.960 --> 29:12.480
It was me. She was distracted
and I hit her.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.960
She's freezing. And in shock.
Already decompensating.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.960
She's unstable. She needs theatre.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.960
Mm. Emergency exploratory
laparotomy.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.960
I can assist. No, you stay here,
where I can find you.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.960
Mr Hasan, let's see how much
you've forgotten about

29:25.960 --> 29:27.640
the surgical abdomen, shall we?

29:31.960 --> 29:32.960
Liver looks OK.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.160
No sign of
small bowel perforation.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
Here's our problem.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.960
Looks like a grade 3 rupture.
Agreed.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.960
Prep for a splenectomy,
please, Sister.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.960
Or we can try to conserve it?
The bleeding's stopped.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.960
Blood pressure?

29:51.960 --> 29:54.960
120 systolic. Pulse steady.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.960
All right, but if I'm not convinced,
it comes out, OK?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.960
No problem. Knife, please, Sister.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
Hey.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.960
Hey, Bobby.
You are not to leave your bed,

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
Dr Nair was very clear about...

30:18.960 --> 30:21.960
Baya weaver.
What?

30:21.960 --> 30:23.960
A male is meant to make up to
500 trips to create its nest.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.160
They weave them with their bills.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.800
People don't think
that birds are smart.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.160
You know a crow is more intelligent
than a chimpanzee?

30:35.160 --> 30:37.960
Tool use, logical reasoning.
They're way ahead.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.960
OK, please.
If your mother finds you out here,

30:39.960 --> 30:42.000
she will actually kill me.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.960
She worries too much.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.960
There's nothing wrong with me.
That's why you sent me home.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.960
How much do they cost?

30:51.480 --> 30:53.800
Is it a flat rate,
or do they have a meter?

30:53.800 --> 30:56.960
I don't know. Like, a few rupees?
I don't use them, I have a car.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.960
OK, can we, please,
get you back to bed?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.960
May I use your stethoscope?
No!

31:10.960 --> 31:12.960
You have good hands, Mr Hasan.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.640
Surprised the Royal College
let you leave.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.960
Truthfully, they begged me to stay.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.480
It was actually quite embarrassing.
Mm-hmm.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.960
Right, I'll supervise recovery,

31:21.960 --> 31:24.960
you go and give Dr Walker
the good news.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.960
Oh, and can you tell her
to come and see me, please?

31:26.960 --> 31:28.960
You're the boss.
Don't forget it.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.320
HE CHUCKLES

31:32.960 --> 31:34.000
Nothing?!

31:34.000 --> 31:36.960
What happened to
the baby-faced assassin?

31:36.960 --> 31:38.960
Mr McConnell,
if you'd merely murdered someone,

31:38.960 --> 31:41.800
we wouldn't have a problem.
This is immigration!

31:41.800 --> 31:45.960
Listen, we have funds.
So perhaps a donation?

31:45.960 --> 31:46.960
To a favourite charity?

31:46.960 --> 31:50.960
I checked.
Not a chance. Refused point blank.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.800
I don't know what's happening
to this country

31:54.800 --> 31:56.960
when an honest lawyer can't
bribe a government official.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.960
It's terrible.
So, what do I do now?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.480
That, I can't tell you.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.480
But, please, be rest assured,
if I can't fix this, no-one can.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.960
What's that?
My bill.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
I prefer cash.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.960
He prefers cash!

32:20.960 --> 32:23.320
SHE KNOCKS
You wanted to see me?

32:23.320 --> 32:24.960
Yeah, come in. Sit down.

32:28.960 --> 32:32.960
I don't appreciate my medical staff
creating work for me.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.960
Being rude to irritating relatives
is one thing,

32:35.960 --> 32:38.960
but rupturing spleens
is quite another, so...

32:38.960 --> 32:41.960
my question is a simple one.
What the hell is going on?

32:46.960 --> 32:47.960
I'm angry.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.960
It's just there.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.960
I think I can control it,
but up it comes again.

33:03.960 --> 33:04.960
When I hit her...

33:06.640 --> 33:07.960
..when I threw that punch...

33:09.640 --> 33:10.960
..I remember exactly what I felt.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.960
I wanted to hurt her.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.960
I wanted her to feel pain.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.960
Not her.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.000
Someone.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.960
This is a demanding job.
Everybody wants something from you.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.960
They expect you to be perfect,

33:39.960 --> 33:41.960
but if you slip up,
they'll crucify you.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.000
And that kind of pressure
can leave you hating the world

33:45.000 --> 33:48.800
for dumping all its problems
at your door. But...

33:48.800 --> 33:50.960
anger isn't the answer.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.320
I'm hard on you for one reason
and one reason only.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.960
You're a good doctor.
You could be a great one.

34:00.960 --> 34:01.960
If you want to be.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.960
Now, I was right about
that other case.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.960
Chronic mercury toxicity.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.960
The levels are sky high.
Do you want me to talk to them?

34:11.960 --> 34:14.960
No. She's my patient.
I'll do it.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.960
Thank you.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.960
Do it again.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.960
SHE WHISPERS A PRAYER

35:15.960 --> 35:16.960
I agree.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.960
Definitely more signs
of cortical activity.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.640
She's waking up?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.960
I think that's what I just said.
Oh, thank God.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.960
Excuse me, can you take me here?

35:47.160 --> 35:50.960
No problem, Bird Man, sir.
You got money?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.960
Come on.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.960
Impossible.
My mother doesn't use skin cream.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.480
Moisturiser, yes,
she's always been careful.

36:09.480 --> 36:11.960
But lightening?
No, this is crazy.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.960
I'm afraid
there's no other explanation.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.960
Dr Walker, let me explain to you.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.960
We are a good family.
My mother is of high caste.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.960
A Brahmin woman.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.960
She has no need to use
these damn potions on her skin

36:26.960 --> 36:29.320
like some peasant.
You have this wrong.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.960
Now, let me talk to Dr Fonseca,
please.

36:31.960 --> 36:35.160
The mercury in her body
has affected her brain.

36:35.160 --> 36:39.800
I'm sorry, but this confusion
will never improve.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.960
She's going to need full-time care
for the rest of her life.

36:41.960 --> 36:46.960
What do you think I have been doing?
I am with her every damn day!

36:46.960 --> 36:48.960
Trying to do my own job
at the same time.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.800
Then, my own husband accuses me
of neglecting him

36:51.800 --> 36:53.000
because there is no food
on his table.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.960
It's impossible!

36:55.960 --> 36:58.960
But this isn't your problem,
Dr Walker,

36:58.960 --> 37:01.960
I have heard enough
of your ridiculous theories.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.960
I am taking my mother home now.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.160
Mumma, come. We're going.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.160
You believe her?

37:10.160 --> 37:13.960
Her reaction seemed totally genuine.
She denied everything.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.000
Her mother doesn't use creams.
Much too good for that (!)

37:17.960 --> 37:19.800
But she has mercury in her system.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.960
So she's right about one thing -
it doesn't make sense.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.160
Thank you, Dr Walker,
I'll take it from here.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.960
Ms Martin?
We have the results of the tests

37:31.960 --> 37:33.960
and I'm delighted to say
everything is completely fine.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
It was almost certainly
a reaction to the heat.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.480
But his body temperature
is back to normal.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.960
Dr Nair is satisfied.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.960
OK. Thank you.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
Erm...

37:44.960 --> 37:46.960
I'm sorry...

37:46.960 --> 37:48.960
about the way
I spoke to you earlier.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.960
It was rude and disrespectful.
Please, please, don't apologise.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.480
I can't imagine what it's like
to be a mother in this situation.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.960
When my cat was vomiting,

37:56.960 --> 37:59.320
I took him to the vet
three times in a single day.

38:01.640 --> 38:05.960
Although a vomiting child
is so much worse, obviously.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.960
It was a hairball.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.960
CHUCKLES

38:17.800 --> 38:19.960
When they're born,
they're just there, you know?

38:19.960 --> 38:22.960
Eat, poo, sleep, repeat.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.960
Basically doable.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.960
Then, after about two years,
they learn to walk properly and...

38:28.960 --> 38:32.160
they actively start
trying to kill themselves,

38:32.160 --> 38:34.960
falling downstairs,
dodging traffic,

38:34.960 --> 38:38.480
eating dishwasher tablets.
Dishwasher tablets?

38:38.480 --> 38:39.960
Twice.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.960
That stage lasts about ten years,

38:43.960 --> 38:46.960
all of which time you've been
working as some sort of unpaid,

38:46.960 --> 38:50.800
untrained bodyguard to a nutcase.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.960
Then, they turn 14
and start totally ignoring you.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.960
So I would definitely stick to cats,

38:55.960 --> 38:58.960
no matter how many hairballs
they swallow.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.960
What about your husband?
Or partner?

39:04.960 --> 39:07.960
The going got tough
and he got going.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.480
Which is fine because we're strong,
independent women

39:11.480 --> 39:13.320
who can do everything, right?

39:13.320 --> 39:15.960
You did do it.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.960
I mean, Bobby's a great kid.
And he's completely fine, so...

39:20.960 --> 39:22.960
that's one less thing
to worry about, right?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.800
Which is your subtle way
of telling me

39:24.800 --> 39:25.960
to collect my perfectly healthy son

39:25.960 --> 39:27.960
and get my neurotic arse
out of your hospital.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
No, no, not at all.
I was just saying...

39:29.960 --> 39:32.960
I'm teasing you.
SHE LAUGHS

39:36.320 --> 39:38.960
Don't worry, we're going.
And thanks.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.160
You're a sweet girl.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.160
Don't listen to a cynical old cow
like me.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.960
Hi.
Hey!

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
Listen, ten years as a pro fighter

39:57.960 --> 40:01.000
and it took a doctor
to put me in hospital.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.960
Yeah, I, erm... I came to apologise.
Oh, I was in the ring, OK?

40:06.960 --> 40:09.960
My safety is my responsibility,
nobody else's.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.960
It doesn't feel like that.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.960
Look, I'm your coach,
not your shrink.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.960
THEY CHUCKLE

40:15.960 --> 40:18.000
But if you do want
a little bit of wisdom...

40:19.960 --> 40:23.960
..everybody gets hit.
But not everybody gets up again.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.960
Yeah.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.960
So, will I see you again in the gym?

40:30.960 --> 40:31.960
Yeah.

40:34.960 --> 40:39.960
Oh, how are you? Are you OK?
Rahul, I'm fine.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.960
Good morning.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.480
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.960
Very fortunate,
my dear husband worked so hard.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.480
Is this him, your husband?

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
He's very handsome.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.960
So, when was this taken?

41:28.960 --> 41:31.960
A long time ago. I forget.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
Well...

41:34.960 --> 41:37.960
they do say
the past is another country.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.960
What are you doing here?

41:45.960 --> 41:47.960
We need to talk.

41:51.960 --> 41:55.960
Dementia is a cruel disease.
As I'm sure you know,

41:55.960 --> 41:58.960
it strips away the new memories
and preserves the old.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.800
So people go backwards,
they retreat into the past.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.960
And that's why your mother
called herself Bhoomy Ambedkar.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.960
Because that's who she really is.
A Dalit woman.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.960
A woman of low caste.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.960
An untouchable.
Yes.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.000
I think she's used
these skin-lightening creams

42:19.000 --> 42:22.960
all her adult life,
believing that somehow

42:22.960 --> 42:25.960
a lighter skin would give her
a different identity.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.000
She became Brahmin
so you could be Brahmin, too.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.960
No, it can't be true.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.000
My father,
he said nothing about this.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.960
He loved my mother.
I don't doubt that for a second.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.800
But would his parents have approved
of him marrying a Dalit woman?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.960
In order to be together,
they lived a lie.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.960
Your father took that secret
with him to the grave,

42:53.960 --> 42:55.960
I think your mother would have done,
too.

42:56.960 --> 43:02.800
And the creams, this poison in her.
There's no cure?

43:02.800 --> 43:06.960
No, I'm afraid not.
The damage is permanent.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.000
I can't find him. He's gone.
What?!

44:04.960 --> 44:06.000
OK.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.960
How long?

44:11.960 --> 44:13.960
OK.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah, OK. Thank you.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.960
How long has your father known?

44:25.960 --> 44:28.960
A few days, I think.
They were waiting for tests.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.960
And they're certain
it's a gastric cancer?

44:30.960 --> 44:34.960
Because I've seen many mistakes
made in the past.

44:34.960 --> 44:37.960
I could organise a second opinion.
My sister called back.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.960
They did the CT.
It's just been confirmed.

44:41.960 --> 44:44.960
Stage four disease.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.320
I need to go to him now.
Yes, of course.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.800
And if there's anything
else we can do... Thank you.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.960
Ruby!

45:12.960 --> 45:15.960
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.960
If you need anything,
you call me, OK?

45:18.960 --> 45:21.960
Call me later.
OK.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.960
I have to go.
Yes.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.160
OK.

45:52.960 --> 45:55.000
