00:02.498 --> 00:04.441
E. R.

00:04.442 --> 00:05.867
Previously on E. R.

00:05.968 --> 00:09.252
Mark's gone. That means you've been
here longer than any other doctor.

00:09.653 --> 00:12.672
People will look to you
to step in and fill the void.

00:12.773 --> 00:13.983
Are you guys insane?

00:14.084 --> 00:16.820
I need to cross-clamp the aorta
with that big-ass clamp.

00:16.921 --> 00:19.020
You don't know what it's called,
you shouldn't use it.

00:19.121 --> 00:21.863
You wanna stay here,
you do what I tell you, when I tell you.

00:21.964 --> 00:22.764
It's that simple.

00:22.765 --> 00:23.765
- No, thank you.
- Come on. There's a meeting at 1.

00:23.866 --> 00:26.129
- Great. Go. I'll catch up.
- When's the last time you went?

00:26.230 --> 00:27.901
- What do you think?
- What's it gonna hurt?

00:28.002 --> 00:30.946
- It'll kill my buzz for starters.
- Come on, one step at a time.

00:31.247 --> 00:34.129
You went for you or because you
promised me you would?

00:34.130 --> 00:35.854
I went for you.

00:38.283 --> 00:40.982
E. R. 8x22 "LOCKDOWN"

00:42.320 --> 00:44.522
- Why is the dog bite still here?
- I don't know.

00:44.693 --> 00:48.101
- Waiting on his IV Unasyn.
- Any particular reason?

00:48.272 --> 00:50.344
Nurses aren't back from ACLS class yet.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.219
The sooner he gets his meds,
the sooner he gets discharged.

00:53.392 --> 00:57.879
- I've done my share of IVs at the VA.
- There's no "I" in "team," Pratt.

00:58.054 --> 01:01.214
- People really say crap like that here?
- No. But they should.

01:01.383 --> 01:03.621
Dr. Weaver on line one
with a mouthful of marbles.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.284
- What happened to her?
- Chipped her tooth in Barbados.

01:06.461 --> 01:08.580
I told her
not to open bottles with her teeth.

01:08.751 --> 01:11.237
So, Pratt, you wanna check
orthostatics in Exam 3?

01:11.415 --> 01:15.025
- Why are you asking him?
- I don't know. He's got a cute ass?

01:15.202 --> 01:17.486
- We're down three nurses.
- Hey, we can help.

01:17.658 --> 01:21.102
- Point is, why should we?
- Let's all pitch in. Pratt, check vitals.

01:21.279 --> 01:24.523
Gallant, why don't you start IVs.
And I'll discharge Martinez here.

01:24.692 --> 01:30.102
- All this because a nurse tells us to.
- Abby is the Obi-Wan Kenobi of nurses.

01:30.270 --> 01:34.508
- So, what does that make you? Yoda?
- Learn from her, you will.

01:34.682 --> 01:37.085
Might have to separate these two.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.092
Burns to the soles of the feet
from hot coals.

01:40.259 --> 01:43.041
- Fire walkers?
- Lawyers.

01:44.047 --> 01:46.580
- Why walk on hot coals?
- It was a bonding exercise.

01:46.753 --> 01:50.079
- We' re partners at the same firm.
- If I could walk, I'd kick your ass!

01:50.249 --> 01:53.279
- Would have worked if she hadn't pushed!
- My feet were burning!

01:53.870 --> 01:55.575
- Anybody smell smoke?
- Yeah, kind of.

01:55.743 --> 01:58.146
- Of course you do. We were charbroiled.
- No, it's...

01:58.324 --> 02:01.567
- It's coming from your cuff!
- Oh, my God! I'm on fire!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.351
Flames!

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.463 --> 02:25.706
Oops.

03:15.474 --> 03:19.425
- This is not a hotel, Stan.
- I got the chills. My teeth are rattling.

03:19.604 --> 03:23.816
- I don't get no rest behind a dumpster.
- I have the flu. You don't see me in bed.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.016
I'd like to.

03:25.194 --> 03:29.027
What about that Hippo oath
you guys took? Do some good, be nice.

03:29.198 --> 03:32.484
- Ask Dr. Pratt. He's handling you today.
- Is this because I'm new?

03:32.661 --> 03:36.327
- No. Because you're annoying.
- Sure could do with a rubdown.

03:36.498 --> 03:40.200
- Who wants the first tetanus shot?
- Me, so I can get away from this moron.

03:40.378 --> 03:42.751
You have to come back
for wound-check tomorrow.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.960
- Rather have my feet amputated.
- You don't have to do it together.

03:46.134 --> 03:48.377
- Showers?
- Don't have to do that together either.

03:48.555 --> 03:51.675
That's fine. Just pat the burns dry
with a clean towel.

03:51.850 --> 03:54.887
Dirty water running down to the foot
increases chance of infection.

03:55.187 --> 03:57.857
- How about the bathtub?
- How about keeping them dry?

03:58.024 --> 04:00.978
How about y'all kiss and make up?
Multiple MVA, two minutes out.

04:04.698 --> 04:07.534
Marge Satterfield, bus driver
of a gamblers' special, 50...

04:07.702 --> 04:08.864
...altered at the scene.

04:09.037 --> 04:12.537
- How's her airway?
- Wide open. Pulse ox, 98. BP, 110/80.

04:12.707 --> 04:15.460
You were in an accident, ma'am.
Let's take her to Trauma 1.

04:15.627 --> 04:18.629
- Busload of senior citizens.
- How many do we have?

04:18.797 --> 04:21.798
- I'll work up this blunt head injury.
- First one out triages.

04:21.968 --> 04:24.210
- Could be a hematoma.
- Next one might be worse.

04:24.388 --> 04:27.887
Colin Prentice, 21, driver.
Head-on collision with the bus.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.550
- Was he restrained?
- Not very well. Two-inch scalp lac.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.018
- Broke the steering wheel.
- He driving a Matchbox?

04:33.189 --> 04:38.148
Worse, a Gremlin. We intubated
for a GCS 2-2-3. BP, 120/70. Pulse, 96.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.690
- Trauma 2, let's go.
- Not by yourself. Get Dr. Lewis to help.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.238
- How's Marge doing? Our driver.
- We don't know.

04:44.411 --> 04:47.662
Ralph Meyers, 73.
Obvious forearm fracture with deformity.

04:47.831 --> 04:51.331
- You having chest or belly pain?
- No. How will I play the slots?

04:51.502 --> 04:55.038
- Just use your other arm.
- I got another one for you, doc.

04:55.214 --> 04:56.590
- Facial lac?
- Broken glass.

04:56.759 --> 04:58.253
Lenore Fong. Neuro's intact.

04:58.426 --> 05:01.096
- How old is she?
- Got me. Doesn't speak English.

05:03.266 --> 05:05.093
- What'd she say?
- "Rude to ask her age. "

05:05.268 --> 05:08.353
Take her to Curtain 2.
Get it out of her, Deb.

05:08.647 --> 05:11.435
Good. That might be it.

05:11.942 --> 05:13.734
Or not.

05:13.903 --> 05:17.154
- Did you call the nurses from ACLS class?
- They're all on a break.

05:17.324 --> 05:19.898
Get some clerks or something.
We're dying down here.

05:20.077 --> 05:23.612
- Can we have our aftercare instructions?
- I'll be right with you.

05:23.789 --> 05:26.791
- Miss, my colostomy bag is leaking.
- Just a minute, okay?

05:26.960 --> 05:30.625
- My family has been here for a long time.
- We got hit with a big accident.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.254
- Both of my kids are sick.
- Someone will see them.

05:33.425 --> 05:35.300
Yeah, we were here first.

05:35.470 --> 05:38.305
I hope my passengers are okay.
They're all so old.

05:38.848 --> 05:41.518
- No hemotympanum, toes downgoing.
- She need the O.R.?

05:41.686 --> 05:44.521
Nothing surgical so far.
Marge, any pain here?

05:44.689 --> 05:47.726
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
No tracheal shift.

05:47.901 --> 05:49.728
- I gotta go.
- Not until you get a vent.

05:49.903 --> 05:53.237
- Call for a C-spine, chest and pelvis.
- I don't know the numbers.

05:53.407 --> 05:55.566
- Look at the phone list.
- Systolic's down to 80.

05:55.744 --> 05:58.698
- Run in two liters wide open.
- This really isn't my job.

05:58.871 --> 06:02.740
- It is today. Feels like a pelvic fracture.
- Hello, this is Dr. Pratt at the ER-

06:02.918 --> 06:05.457
- Please hold.
- Draw blood for a CBC and chem panel.

06:05.629 --> 06:07.338
- I'm on hold.
- Type and cross for four.

06:07.506 --> 06:09.167
- Find some O-neg.
- Got the SonoSite.

06:09.342 --> 06:12.012
Oh, good. I need to rule out
intra-abdominal bleed.

06:12.179 --> 06:14.849
- Chem panel goes in red top or green top?
- Abby, help.

06:15.016 --> 06:17.222
- Excuse me?
- Go see if Kovac needs you.

06:17.393 --> 06:20.478
- I need to start a dopamine drip.
- T op-right drawer.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.770
- How's it going?
- Might get more criticals.

06:22.941 --> 06:25.860
Everybody's got multiple medical
problems. Is this 400 and 250?

06:26.028 --> 06:27.737
- It's a premix.
- Where's the head?

06:27.905 --> 06:29.779
- It's not in here.
- Then where?

06:29.950 --> 06:32.655
- No fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- Sir, you can't be in here.

06:32.828 --> 06:36.873
- But I gotta take a whiz.
- Come with me. Hang a left.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.999
Can you call my daughter?

06:39.168 --> 06:43.214
Everybody move to the admit area
so I can assess all of your injuries.

06:43.381 --> 06:44.924
- Wanna see my bruises?
- Not now.

06:45.092 --> 06:47.844
- It hurts when I walk.
- Hey, Gallant, deal with this.

06:48.012 --> 06:52.141
Listen, everybody proceed to the north.
We'll get you all taken care of.

06:52.309 --> 06:55.725
- Where the hell is north?
- All right, got the pressors.

06:55.896 --> 06:59.728
- I thought she was hypertensive.
- Probably vagalled with the blood draw.

06:59.901 --> 07:02.190
You could check him
for compartment syndrome.

07:02.362 --> 07:03.607
Why not?

07:05.157 --> 07:06.817
Can you wiggle your fingers?

07:06.992 --> 07:10.327
Damn foreigners ought to just get
their own bus!

07:14.292 --> 07:16.250
- What'd she say?
- "I had a fever. "

07:16.420 --> 07:20.501
- And then something about his mother.
- Probably set the driver off, that gibberish.

07:20.674 --> 07:24.887
- Marge was twitching, she was so mad.
- Twitching?

07:25.055 --> 07:27.594
- Like a Holy Roller.
- Excuse me.

07:27.766 --> 07:29.925
- Might have had a seizure.
- After the accident?

07:30.102 --> 07:32.345
Before.
She have a medical alert bracelet?

07:32.521 --> 07:33.601
Check her wallet.

07:33.773 --> 07:36.894
Mental status is consistent
with a post-ictal state.

07:37.068 --> 07:40.236
- I've got a couple of really sick kids.
- I'm busy right now.

07:40.406 --> 07:43.822
- Half-load of phenytoin, send off levels.
- They had fevers a week ago...

07:43.994 --> 07:45.868
- ... then developed a rash.
- No myoclonus.

07:46.037 --> 07:50.118
- Pretty bad. Think you need to see them.
- Go, Carter. We got this.

07:53.254 --> 07:56.623
- Sir, ma'am, this is Dr. Carter.
- Okay, let's take a look.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.213
We thought it was chickenpox,
but I've never seen it as bad as this.

08:03.766 --> 08:07.467
- Can you lift up her shirt?
- It's not on her chest or her stomach.

08:07.646 --> 08:09.473
Adam doesn't have it as bad.

08:15.279 --> 08:19.195
- When did the rash start?
- Three days ago.

08:21.662 --> 08:24.200
- How long have you been waiting?
- Too long.

08:24.373 --> 08:28.075
Tried to tell that nurse,
but she said it was busy.

08:28.878 --> 08:30.872
Could it be an allergic reaction?

08:32.174 --> 08:37.596
No. Would you excuse me?
Get masks on them.

08:41.018 --> 08:43.342
- Hey, what's up?
- Where are the tubes?

08:43.520 --> 08:45.847
- What?
- Those tubes with the posters in them.

08:46.024 --> 08:49.689
Oh, those Public Health things?
They should be over there, man.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.911
Oh, man.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.544
What? What's going on?

09:05.171 --> 09:08.541
Michael, would you go get Dr. Lewis?
Now!

09:08.717 --> 09:12.845
I'm gonna move you to a private room.
Can you take Adam? Follow me quickly.

09:13.305 --> 09:15.677
- What is it?
- It's just a precaution. Excuse me.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.843
Coming through here.

09:18.353 --> 09:20.262
Can you move out of the way?

09:20.814 --> 09:23.387
- Why are we running?
- Just stay with me.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.359
Right up here.

09:34.038 --> 09:38.035
- All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
- What is going on?

09:38.209 --> 09:41.413
- Where is she?
- Getting a central-line kit.

09:42.297 --> 09:44.753
Susan, just come with me.

09:46.761 --> 09:49.430
- I think I got two cases of smallpox.
- Oh, my God.

09:49.597 --> 09:52.598
Firm, deep-seated pustules,
all in the same stage of development.

09:52.768 --> 09:56.386
- Just a bad case of chickenpox.
- Centrifugal distribution sparing the trunk.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.022
It's all the major criteria.

09:58.191 --> 10:01.311
We haven't had a case here
since the '40s.

10:01.486 --> 10:03.770
It's airborne.
We need to lock this place down.

10:05.674 --> 10:09.589
Okay. Elevator lobby, north stairwell,
south corridor are all secure.

10:09.762 --> 10:13.096
- Security's locking the ambulance bay.
- Is that a fire safety violation?

10:13.266 --> 10:15.259
- We' re closed.
- Is Public Health on the way?

10:15.435 --> 10:16.894
Do I call the State Department?

10:17.063 --> 10:19.554
- Check the emergency response plan.
- This is the plan.

10:19.732 --> 10:22.022
- I don't know. Call all three.
- Hey, hold on.

10:22.193 --> 10:25.361
- Think you're jumping to conclusions?
- You seen smallpox before?

10:25.530 --> 10:29.399
No, that's my point. It could be anything.
Scabies, pityriasis, chickenpox.

10:29.578 --> 10:32.532
- This is not chickenpox.
- Are you 100 percent certain?

10:32.706 --> 10:36.290
- You wanna risk exposure to the city?
- Whoa! How bad is it?

10:36.461 --> 10:38.620
- Killed half of Europe.
- They have a vaccine.

10:38.796 --> 10:40.873
- The CDC should have a stockpile.
- In Chicago?

10:41.049 --> 10:42.460
- Atlanta.
- Oh, great.

10:42.635 --> 10:44.627
Luka's right.
Smallpox has been eradicated.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.548
I heard the Russians had some on ice.

10:46.723 --> 10:48.715
- If a terrorist group-
- Shut up, Jerry.

10:48.892 --> 10:51.846
Damn, I should have called in sick today.

10:52.063 --> 10:54.388
- What?
- Lock it down. They're on their way.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.060
- The entire hospital?
- The ER.

10:56.234 --> 10:59.236
- What do we do about critical patients?
- You're asking me?

10:59.404 --> 11:01.528
- They're brother and sister.
- Yeah.

11:01.699 --> 11:03.775
- Five and 10?
- Yeah, why?

11:03.952 --> 11:07.073
I think I treated them last Tuesday.
They presented with the flu.

11:07.247 --> 11:09.205
I have a fever.

11:10.877 --> 11:13.499
- You need to be quarantined.
- Hey, slow down, guys.

11:13.671 --> 11:15.795
Susan, you gotta
come up with a plan now.

11:15.966 --> 11:19.086
Okay, okay. Deb, Carter's right.
You're quarantined to Exam 4.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.299
Jerry, pull the staff schedule and
patient log from last Tuesday.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.808
Luka, re-assess all the patients,
group the criticals.

11:25.978 --> 11:30.190
- I'll take care of Public Health.
- What about the kids?

11:34.238 --> 11:37.405
Nobody panics. Nobody starts
any rumors. This is just routine.

11:37.576 --> 11:40.529
Then you better tell them
why the doors are locked.

11:42.748 --> 11:44.123
Carter, wait.

11:44.292 --> 11:47.209
Do you know that family sat
in Chairs for 45 minutes?

11:47.379 --> 11:49.953
- Should have been isolated.
- They would, had I seen them.

11:50.132 --> 11:54.261
- Pretty hard to miss.
- We're down three nurses. I told you.

11:54.429 --> 11:57.680
- What are you doing?
- If it's smallpox, it could get septic.

11:57.849 --> 11:59.723
- Hope I'm not right.
- You'll need help.

11:59.894 --> 12:02.053
Don't come if you're worried
about exposure.

12:02.230 --> 12:04.555
I've already been exposed.

12:11.825 --> 12:14.316
Who's in charge?
I got a cop telling me I can't go.

12:14.495 --> 12:16.951
- Why are you detaining us?
- I'm about to explain.

12:17.122 --> 12:20.077
- If I don't get a cigarette, I'll go postal.
- Ma'am, please!

12:20.251 --> 12:24.084
- Okay, Jerry. Does this thing still work?
- It did in '95.

12:24.256 --> 12:28.551
- What the hell is going on, huh?
- Does this place even have a license?

12:28.720 --> 12:34.226
Sorry. I'm Dr. Lewis.
As you may have noticed...

12:34.393 --> 12:36.766
...there are guards
posted at all the exits.

12:37.146 --> 12:41.015
This is because we have
a potential public health concern.

12:41.193 --> 12:44.230
I would like to emphasize
the word "potential. "

12:44.406 --> 12:47.610
Because at present, we don't have
any conclusive evidence.

12:47.784 --> 12:49.778
City authorities
are on their way to assist.

12:49.954 --> 12:52.528
However, until we have
more information...

12:52.707 --> 12:57.916
...we ask that no one enter
or leave the department.

12:58.088 --> 13:01.874
- What do you mean we can't leave?
- This is purely a precaution.

13:02.051 --> 13:05.837
When I know more, you'll know more.
Thank you for your patience.

13:06.015 --> 13:10.428
- I want out of here! I'm getting out!
- My wife is expecting me!

13:10.603 --> 13:13.890
Don't you understand? What kind
of authorities are you talking about?

13:14.066 --> 13:17.649
- That helping?
- Do I look like her?

13:17.820 --> 13:21.356
- Not as bad.
- Was anybody sick around you?

13:21.533 --> 13:25.366
- I don't think so.
- We were at the embassies, hotels.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.080
- We stood out.
- Where?

13:27.248 --> 13:30.665
Central Africa. Craig works
for the State Department.

13:30.836 --> 13:32.794
- When did you get back?
- Two weeks ago.

13:33.756 --> 13:36.876
Okay. Okay, we need to keep you
both in isolation.

13:37.927 --> 13:40.051
- Why?
- You could be incubating the virus.

13:40.223 --> 13:43.509
- You probably both are.
- You said 10 to 14 days.

13:43.852 --> 13:46.937
We need to know where you've been,
who you've been with...

13:47.105 --> 13:49.146
...since your kids developed a fever.

13:49.317 --> 13:51.642
- The kids were in school.
- They could get sicker?

13:51.820 --> 13:55.271
We need skin biopsies and smears
to send to the CDC biocontainment lab.

13:55.449 --> 13:59.578
- They could die?
- We're being careful. Nothing's confirmed.

13:59.745 --> 14:01.572
Dr. Carter.

14:02.874 --> 14:03.954
Is she tachycardiac?

14:04.167 --> 14:06.624
I don't know,
but you're freaking them out.

14:06.796 --> 14:08.587
Slow down.

14:12.761 --> 14:14.173
Hey, you okay?

14:14.346 --> 14:18.095
Biggest public health emergency
of the century, and I'm stuck here.

14:18.268 --> 14:21.305
Stuck?
This is the damn Ritz if you ask me.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.643
Sorry. You got a roommate.

14:22.815 --> 14:26.184
Oh, come on! Were you really here
last Tuesday, Stan?

14:26.361 --> 14:27.986
Yeah, sure I was.

14:28.155 --> 14:30.314
You know, they say
this could be very serious.

14:30.491 --> 14:36.495
I've had gastritis, hepatitis, pancreatitis.
A little pox is not gonna bother me.

14:38.709 --> 14:43.455
- You got a temperature too?
- Probably just a flu.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.722
It's not smallpox. It can't be.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.227
It's just gotta be a mistake.

15:05.533 --> 15:07.609
- County.
- How in the hell long is it gonna be?

15:07.786 --> 15:10.740
- Sir, I don't know.
- Will you pay for the hours I miss?

15:10.914 --> 15:13.951
- Gallant, how are the seniors?
- Mostly sprains and contusions.

15:14.126 --> 15:16.534
Thank God for small favors.
What about Public Health?

15:16.713 --> 15:21.376
En route. But Chicago P.D. is here,
with billy clubs and handcuffs.

15:21.551 --> 15:25.052
Gee, I feel safe now.
Where do you think you're going?

15:25.223 --> 15:27.133
She needs a head CT.
She's not infectious.

15:27.308 --> 15:28.589
Does she have a blown pupil?

15:28.769 --> 15:30.050
- No.
- Then she can wait.

15:30.229 --> 15:33.147
- She's an older trauma patient.
- Do you know where you are?

15:33.900 --> 15:38.361
- Looks like a hospital. A crappy one.
- I'd say she's pretty lucid.

15:38.906 --> 15:40.531
Dr. Lewis.

15:40.699 --> 15:43.238
David Torres, Public Health.
We can take over now.

15:43.411 --> 15:46.911
- The crisis or the patient care?
- This is for contact tracing.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.075
- And this is for you.
- Okay.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.918
The CDC will be flying in from Atlanta.
We need this area for our staff.

15:53.090 --> 15:56.923
Dr. Torres, I'm down in Engineering.
First and second floor share ventilation.

15:57.094 --> 15:59.586
- Kill the a. c.
- It's 80 degrees outside.

15:59.764 --> 16:02.766
Welcome to the hot zone.
May I see the infected kids, please?

16:04.604 --> 16:08.187
No, the infection's in the bloodstream,
which makes the lungs leak fluid.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.775
- But she's been responding to oxygen.
- We never should have been there!

16:11.945 --> 16:13.191
You could have stayed home.

16:13.364 --> 16:15.274
And your children
don't see you for a year!

16:15.450 --> 16:16.825
100/60. Pulse, 98.

16:16.994 --> 16:18.821
If there was an outbreak,
we'd have heard.

16:18.996 --> 16:22.116
Craig, we were targets.
A maniac is using this as a weapon.

16:22.292 --> 16:25.542
- There are a lot of unknowns.
- There's something wrong with Bree.

16:25.712 --> 16:28.630
- Pulse ox is down to 83 on 15 liters.
- What does that mean?

16:28.799 --> 16:31.551
That means she's not getting
enough oxygen.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.800
Come with me, Adam. You're fine.
I just need room to work on your sister.

16:35.974 --> 16:38.431
- Etomidate, atropine and sux.
- What is that?

16:38.602 --> 16:41.355
Medication to sedate her.
We may put a tube down her throat.

16:41.523 --> 16:43.231
Abby, wait!

16:43.817 --> 16:47.436
- We don't want to infect Pratt's patient.
- We need a pediatric intubation tray.

16:48.406 --> 16:51.823
All right. I'll go around.
Keep her on 100 percent non-rebreather.

16:51.993 --> 16:55.279
- We're gonna need another room.
- And a decontamination area.

16:59.837 --> 17:03.004
- You gotta clear out.
- Could have a pulmonary contusion.

17:03.173 --> 17:06.839
- What's his PO-2?
- I can't get an ABG down to the lab.

17:07.471 --> 17:09.678
It's a mucous plug.
He just needs suction.

17:09.848 --> 17:12.055
Then a vent, Neurosurg consult,
a burr hole.

17:12.226 --> 17:15.262
I got an airborne deadly virus in there.

17:16.897 --> 17:18.522
- What are you doing?
- Moving him.

17:18.692 --> 17:21.147
- He could crash in the hall.
- Smallpox could get him.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.858
Little girl needs an airway.
I need this room.

17:24.031 --> 17:26.569
Why don't you calm down?
We don't know if it's smallpox.

17:26.743 --> 17:28.736
Bag him. Let's go.

17:33.043 --> 17:34.537
- I need to get by.
- You can't.

17:34.712 --> 17:37.203
- I work here.
- ER's been locked down. Move back.

17:37.381 --> 17:39.421
- Why?
- Just trying to secure the building.

17:39.593 --> 17:42.546
I'm the Chief of Emergency Medicine.
I need to get in there.

17:42.721 --> 17:44.513
- I said, step back!
- Dr. Weaver?

17:44.682 --> 17:47.600
- What's going on?
- They wouldn't let us back down.

17:47.769 --> 17:52.562
Hi, it's Kerry Weaver. Get Dr. Romano.
No, don't you dare put me on hold!

17:52.733 --> 17:54.892
- I heard it's something contagious.
- Like what?

17:55.069 --> 17:57.905
- Excuse me, are you in charge?
- No, find him.

17:58.073 --> 18:01.110
- They brought my fiancé here.
- They're not letting anyone in.

18:01.285 --> 18:05.235
- Yes, it's an emergency.
- He got into a bad accident.

18:05.414 --> 18:09.247
Marta Guzman, 18, GSW to
the right chest. Last BP, 80 palp.

18:09.419 --> 18:13.252
- They shut down the ER.
- Nobody radioed us. I've got a GSW.

18:13.424 --> 18:15.714
- My fiancé may be dying.
- You cannot go inside.

18:16.135 --> 18:19.090
- Take her to Mercy?
- Not with her pressure dropping.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.762
- No breath sounds on the right. Let us in.
- Not this entrance. Not this floor.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.645
She is bleeding into her chest.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.396
How long do you think
we'll be stuck in here?

18:29.569 --> 18:33.153
I don't know. Maybe a day or two.

18:34.158 --> 18:36.732
Might have to spend the night together.

18:37.536 --> 18:39.364
You afraid?

18:40.791 --> 18:44.410
Of catching smallpox
or waking up next to you?

18:49.008 --> 18:51.215
Okay, looking good.

18:51.386 --> 18:54.341
- No retractions.
- He likes having his own room.

18:54.515 --> 18:58.135
- You like having a little sister?
- I bet you two never fight, do you?

18:58.311 --> 19:01.064
- I didn't think so.
- The alarm's going off!

19:02.900 --> 19:05.392
- Sinus brady at 45.
- Push. 4 of atropine.

19:05.570 --> 19:08.026
Kids can drop their heart rate
when oxygen gets low.

19:08.198 --> 19:10.986
- I thought you fixed that.
- Lost the pulse.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.530
- V-fib. Starting compressions. Get Lewis.
- Oh, God!

19:14.706 --> 19:17.707
- Hey, Pratt! Pratt! Get in here!
- Hurry up!

19:17.877 --> 19:21.246
- Help her, please!
- Want me to start bagging?

19:21.423 --> 19:25.290
- No. Charge the paddles to 50.
- What's up?

19:25.469 --> 19:28.257
- Vascular clamp.
-0-silk's ready.

19:28.430 --> 19:31.883
- My children. They need me.
- Yes, they do, Marta.

19:32.061 --> 19:37.186
So hold on. All right, tube's in.
Needle driver.

19:37.358 --> 19:39.398
- My kids.
- Somebody say "Thora-Seal"?

19:39.569 --> 19:43.402
- Right here!
- Be careful. You break it, you buy it.

19:45.034 --> 19:47.870
- How about some Vaseline gauze?
- How about a 2-ton safe?

19:48.205 --> 19:51.574
- Robert, I need to get her to Surgery.
- Tell me something I don't know.

19:51.751 --> 19:54.206
Security's holding the freight elevator.
Meet there.

19:54.379 --> 19:56.537
-500 cc's out so far.
- Pressure's up to 100.

19:56.715 --> 19:59.087
Why has the Public Health Department
closed the ER?

19:59.259 --> 20:00.884
I have no idea. Elastoplast now.

20:01.053 --> 20:02.963
Is there a communicable disease
in the ER?

20:03.139 --> 20:07.469
- Usually is. Pressure bags on both liters.
- Are you in touch with anyone inside?

20:07.644 --> 20:09.518
- Yes, I am.
- Who the hell is that?

20:09.689 --> 20:11.896
- Chief of Emergency Medicine.
- How many infected?

20:12.234 --> 20:15.151
We don't know that anyone
is infected with anything.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.405
- What disease can close a hospital?
- Don't say it, Kerry.

20:18.574 --> 20:22.158
- Maybe Ebola virus, anthrax?
- I told you, I don't know.

20:22.496 --> 20:24.453
Set the chest tube on water seal.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.782
Are you aware that
the Smallpox Response Team...

20:26.959 --> 20:29.166
...has been dispatched from the CDC?

20:29.337 --> 20:31.544
- Why didn't you tell us?
- We' re sitting ducks!

20:31.715 --> 20:33.043
Clear.

20:34.468 --> 20:36.426
- Still fib.
-5 minutes since the last epi.

20:36.596 --> 20:38.553
- Another. 2.
- Why isn't it working?

20:38.723 --> 20:42.009
Charging to 80. And clear!

20:43.020 --> 20:44.598
- No change.
- Let's try procainamide.

20:44.772 --> 20:47.560
- You wanna give that to kids?
-200 at 20 per minute.

20:47.734 --> 20:50.023
- She's lighter than that.
- Know what you're doing?

20:50.196 --> 20:52.568
- We're following protocol.
- Charging to 90. Clear.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.235
- Call someone!
- Still fib.

20:54.617 --> 20:56.859
- I want someone more experienced!
- There's no one!

20:57.287 --> 21:00.870
- Well, call them now!
- Nobody's seen this disease for 50 years.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.034
- Clear.
- Why aren't you telling us anything?

21:03.211 --> 21:05.749
- We don't even know if it's smallpox!
- Give us masks!

21:05.923 --> 21:08.248
- You've already been exposed.
- To what?

21:08.425 --> 21:12.970
- We don't know, but we can help.
- By letting us go! I gotta get out of here.

21:13.140 --> 21:16.805
We can't do that. We won't do that.
We need time.

21:16.978 --> 21:21.854
Listen! Listen! The exits are surrounded
by the Chicago Police Department!

21:22.025 --> 21:24.979
- The police?
- If you leave, you will be arrested!

21:25.154 --> 21:28.191
- We've been prisoners for four hours!
- You will be arrested!

21:28.366 --> 21:31.368
- You better come check on Carter.
- Please return to your seats.

21:31.536 --> 21:34.704
Please, I have to go home!
I don't want my baby getting sick!

21:34.874 --> 21:36.582
- Clear.
- Fine V-fib.

21:36.751 --> 21:39.159
- Could be a loose wire.
- It's not the leads, Pratt.

21:39.338 --> 21:42.173
- Charging again to 100.
- Maybe it's not shocking her right.

21:42.341 --> 21:44.797
Everything's working fine. Clear.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.056
- Asystole.
- Damn it!

21:49.225 --> 21:52.511
She could be hypovolemic.
Check for a pulse with compressions.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.178
If you can't feel a pulse,
she needs a fluid bolus.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.930
- That's not the problem.
- Well, maybe it'll help!

21:58.110 --> 22:01.694
Good pulse with CPR. She doesn't
need fluids. How long has it been?

22:02.657 --> 22:06.241
- Forty minutes.
- How about high-dose epi?

22:07.538 --> 22:09.697
- We've done everything.
- Could be worth a shot.

22:09.957 --> 22:11.784
- That's it.
- What are you doing?

22:11.960 --> 22:15.128
You have to keep going! He had an idea!

22:15.297 --> 22:18.002
You have to keep going!

22:18.218 --> 22:21.385
Help her!

22:21.930 --> 22:25.163
Tell the CDC we have our first casualty.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.660
- What are you doing?
- I thought I was helping.

22:36.830 --> 22:39.534
You're not. When I call a code, that's it.
No discussion.

22:39.707 --> 22:41.035
You overlooked high-dose epi.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.662
Especially when the mother
is sitting there.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.159
- It was worth a shot!
- Well, you were wrong.

22:46.335 --> 22:50.249
- Well, now we'll never know.
- Do you ever listen?

22:50.422 --> 22:52.543
- Do you?
- High-dose epi does not result...

22:52.715 --> 22:55.630
...in return of spontaneous circulation,
or increased survival.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.792
If you read the literature,
you would know!

22:57.967 --> 22:58.998
Or you could teach me.

22:59.176 --> 23:01.796
I don't have time to stop
and explain things to you.

23:01.970 --> 23:05.135
- I'm supposed to read your mind?
- No. Shut up and follow my lead!

23:05.305 --> 23:07.593
- Then lead!
- Excuse me.

23:08.349 --> 23:11.680
The Health Department wants
us to double-shroud her.

23:11.851 --> 23:13.926
- I'll do it.
- You're not going back in there.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.674
- The mother still has questions.
- I'll take care of it.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.390
- She trusts me.
- I said, no.

23:21.064 --> 23:22.973
- You feel hot.
- What?

23:23.523 --> 23:26.938
- Abby, can you take his temperature?
- It's 100 degrees in here.

23:27.109 --> 23:29.860
- You feel hotter than that to me.
- I feel fine.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.026
You have a fever.

23:36.865 --> 23:38.145
101.4.

23:40.450 --> 23:43.699
- You always have to be right.
- And you have to be quarantined.

23:46.037 --> 23:48.277
- You've been here for five hours?
- Six.

23:48.455 --> 23:52.617
Six! That's outrageous.
I'll be with you in just a moment.

23:52.791 --> 23:55.624
- Where are you going with these?
- We can't blow germs around.

23:55.793 --> 23:59.207
Forget smallpox. We'll have 100
starvation deaths if we don't get food.

23:59.377 --> 24:02.377
You've got 20 minutes,
then I'm ordering out pizza.

24:02.547 --> 24:04.455
What's the name
of that Public Health guy?

24:04.631 --> 24:06.005
David Torres.

24:06.173 --> 24:07.964
- Your first name?
- Why?

24:08.133 --> 24:12.509
Class-action lawsuit. False imprisonment,
intentional infliction of emotional distress.

24:12.677 --> 24:16.175
Public Health has the authority-
Malik, who is that?

24:16.346 --> 24:19.049
- What?
- That voice.

24:19.223 --> 24:20.965
- Jerry?
- Vaccination of contacts...

24:21.141 --> 24:23.298
...can avert a widespread epidemic.

24:23.475 --> 24:26.925
We refer to this strategy as
"surveillance and containment."

24:27.102 --> 24:31.394
I want to assure the public
that there is no need for panic.

24:31.563 --> 24:34.682
And that only those in close contact...

24:34.857 --> 24:37.393
...with the infected individuals
need the vaccine.

24:37.566 --> 24:43.567
What? I was just calling my mom.
I love you too, Mom.

24:44.904 --> 24:47.774
Brian Meadows is on the scene
talking with two nurses...

24:47.947 --> 24:50.698
...who are unable to report
for duty because-

24:57.036 --> 25:00.949
- Do you have to cover her face?
- Yes, I ' m sorry.

25:01.747 --> 25:05.115
- Do you want to take a minute?
- Yeah.

25:27.262 --> 25:29.633
- Mr. Turner?
- My wife didn't wanna go.

25:29.805 --> 25:34.097
- We don't know how the kids got sick.
- No, it's my fault.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.514
- Punch biopsy is next.
- Okay.

25:38.101 --> 25:42.845
Private jet will take the samples
to Atlanta for EM and PCR.

25:43.897 --> 25:45.935
How's your breathing?

25:47.649 --> 25:49.724
- Dad?
- Yeah?

25:50.358 --> 25:51.900
Was she scared?

25:53.110 --> 25:57.271
- What?
- Bree. When it happened.

25:59.447 --> 26:01.687
She was asleep.

26:01.865 --> 26:04.948
- Am I next?
- No.

26:06.118 --> 26:07.944
You promise?

26:11.037 --> 26:13.029
I promise.

26:25.962 --> 26:31.167
- I have been ringing for 10 minutes!
- Hell, I had to ring for an hour.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.379
What do you need?
Have to use the bathroom?

26:33.550 --> 26:36.087
Yes! Not that it's any
of your business.

26:36.259 --> 26:39.958
- How bad is it?
- Really, really bad.

26:40.137 --> 26:41.879
What are you doing?
What's the point?

26:42.055 --> 26:44.627
If they bring an N95 mask
and a gown...

26:44.806 --> 26:48.055
- ... I can at least use the ladies' room.
- Don't hold your breath.

26:48.225 --> 26:50.300
It's not my breath
I'm worried about holding.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.800
Here, you wanna use mine?

26:54.061 --> 26:56.681
- Her Dilantin level was eight?
- Lab even re-checked it.

26:56.855 --> 26:58.728
It's a water fountain, not a birdbath.

26:58.898 --> 27:01.566
Doctor, I can't take my Naprosyn
on an empty stomach.

27:01.733 --> 27:04.401
- We may have some crackers.
- Crackers? You got crackers?

27:04.568 --> 27:10.152
Hey, eighter from Decatur! Boxcars?
Oh, man!

27:10.321 --> 27:12.609
Play somewhere else.
I need to talk to Marge.

27:12.780 --> 27:14.773
- But she's our lady luck.
- It's important.

27:14.949 --> 27:17.273
Party pooper.

27:18.159 --> 27:22.155
"What's up, doc? "
I bet you hear that all the time.

27:23.329 --> 27:25.486
How'd you get
a commercial driver's license?

27:26.664 --> 27:29.118
- You have epilepsy, Marge.
- Just an occasional tic.

27:29.290 --> 27:33.665
- I haven't had a seizure in years.
- Where'd you get your Dilantin?

27:34.168 --> 27:36.836
Mexico? The Internet?

27:37.253 --> 27:40.668
- You gonna tell the insurance company?
- You had a seizure while driving.

27:40.839 --> 27:43.957
- Could have killed everyone on the bus.
- You said they were okay.

27:44.341 --> 27:45.669
Come here.

27:48.176 --> 27:51.010
That's the guy you hit.
Does he look okay?

27:51.178 --> 27:52.801
What's wrong with him?

27:52.971 --> 27:55.377
- Luka!
- I'll be back.

27:59.308 --> 28:00.966
- Pressure's 60.
- Where's he bleeding?

28:01.142 --> 28:03.429
The pelvic fracture.
I should re-scan the belly.

28:03.602 --> 28:06.804
- Looks like the IV's infiltrated.
- Yeah, throw in a central line.

28:06.978 --> 28:11.354
- Be ready to transfuse two units.
- Yeah, if we could get to the blood bank.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.515
- I hear you had crackers.
- Haven't seen any.

28:13.691 --> 28:17.141
Are people lying to me? I will kick
someone's ass if I don't get to eat!

28:17.318 --> 28:19.356
Don't come in here!

28:22.738 --> 28:25.358
- Etomidate's on board.
- Sixty of sux.

28:25.531 --> 28:29.278
- You're gonna go to sleep now, Adam.
- Not like with Bree. Just a little while.

28:29.450 --> 28:31.406
- Your mom and dad will be right here.
- Adam?

28:31.576 --> 28:32.655
He's out.

28:32.827 --> 28:35.945
Give me crichoid pressure,
some suction.

28:37.871 --> 28:40.029
Oh, God. His upper airway
is covered in lesions.

28:40.206 --> 28:43.371
- Can you see the cords?
- No, I won't be able to pass that tube.

28:43.541 --> 28:44.869
- Bag him.
- Oh, no.

28:45.042 --> 28:47.876
- You have to crike him?
- I can't.

28:48.044 --> 28:51.376
If I cut through the pox, it'll
seed his lungs and make him worse.

28:55.757 --> 28:58.710
- No free fluid. It's a pelvic hematoma.
- Systolic's only 50.

28:58.883 --> 29:02.713
- I get a flash, but I can't thread.
- I'm gonna go get a cutdown tray.

29:02.886 --> 29:05.376
- Lost the carotid.
- Start compressions.

29:05.554 --> 29:08.637
Carter's patient's in trouble.
We need a surgical airway.

29:08.806 --> 29:10.845
- This guy's bleeding out.
- What should I say?

29:11.016 --> 29:13.719
T o do the best he can, okay?

29:15.643 --> 29:18.097
We need to open the lower neck
to avoid the lesions.

29:18.270 --> 29:20.557
A surgeon will come
and do a formal tracheostomy.

29:20.730 --> 29:24.310
- Then he'll be better?
- Definitely.

29:24.732 --> 29:26.640
- Luka's patient's in arrest.
- Get Romano.

29:26.816 --> 29:29.650
- I don't think they're letting any-
- Just get him.

29:31.236 --> 29:34.603
- Dr. Carter for you.
- How are things in the leper colony?

29:34.779 --> 29:37.316
- You're on with Romano.
- Hello? You called me.

29:37.489 --> 29:40.239
The kid needs a trach.
I'd like to bring him upstairs.

29:40.407 --> 29:43.941
- Forget it. You'll infect the entire hospital.
- Why don't you come down?

29:44.117 --> 29:47.070
- That's easier said than done.
- Look, I need some help.

29:47.412 --> 29:51.454
I'll see what I can work out. Under the
circumstances, you may be on your own.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.906
- Just get your ass down here.
- Sats are dropping.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.624
- Prep the neck.
- You sure?

29:57.793 --> 30:00.246
- Yeah, sure.
- You said a surgeon has to do this.

30:00.669 --> 30:03.337
- Yeah, I started out in Surgery.
- What does that mean?

30:03.504 --> 30:08.295
- It means Dr. Carter can do this.
- Give me a 10 blade.

30:10.842 --> 30:14.339
- Form a single-file line.
- I need it for my blood sugar!

30:14.511 --> 30:18.127
- Damn it, people! We are not animals!
- And we are not children either!

30:18.304 --> 30:20.011
- Dr. Lewis!
- Not now, Jerry.

30:20.180 --> 30:23.797
- It stinks! Can we open a window?
- No!

30:23.974 --> 30:27.176
- Bitch!
- They didn't bring any diet soda.

30:27.351 --> 30:31.347
We're doing the best we can.
A little sugar is not gonna kill you.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.768
Thyroid isthmus is huge.
Suction. Come on, suction!

30:34.939 --> 30:37.263
- I'm trying.
- God, there's so much blood!

30:37.440 --> 30:39.562
All right, hemostat.

30:40.275 --> 30:43.358
- Bradying down.
- I can't even see the tracheal rings.

30:43.694 --> 30:45.732
Another Kelly, 4x4s,
and keep suctioning.

30:45.903 --> 30:47.101
Okay.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.030
- Mr. Turner, squeeze this bag.
- No. No.

30:50.197 --> 30:53.944
Put your hand here, keep the mask
secured and squeeze every three seconds.

30:54.117 --> 30:57.282
One, two, three, bag.
One, two, three, bag.

30:57.994 --> 31:00.448
He's dropping his pressure.
Spike another liter?

31:00.620 --> 31:03.868
No. Keep this field clean
so I can see what I'm doing. 4x4s.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.955
- They're not answering the phone.
- Things are hectic.

31:12.127 --> 31:16.454
- Is he still okay?
- As soon as I get in, I'll check on him.

31:21.007 --> 31:23.497
- Dr. Lutz-
- No statements at this time.

31:23.676 --> 31:27.007
No comments. I have no statement
at this time. No comments.

31:27.177 --> 31:30.462
Kerry Weaver. I chair the hospital's
Bioterrorism Committee...

31:30.638 --> 31:33.388
- ... and I'm Chief of the ER.
- Why aren't you inside?

31:33.556 --> 31:36.224
- I wasn't here.
- At least you weren't exposed.

31:36.391 --> 31:39.972
- I would like to be able to assist.
- Only necessary personnel at this point.

31:40.143 --> 31:42.301
- This is my ER.
- Not anymore.

31:42.478 --> 31:44.199
Sorry, doctor.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.264
Tracheal hook.

31:48.981 --> 31:51.435
Retract cephalad.

31:53.067 --> 31:56.435
- Short run of V-tach. Lidocaine?
- No, he needs oxygen. 11 blade. Got it.

31:56.611 --> 31:58.733
Bag faster.

31:58.904 --> 32:01.476
All right. Number four Shiley.

32:02.864 --> 32:06.315
Pressure's 70. Sats are down to 81.

32:08.034 --> 32:09.907
- It won't go.
- What about a heliox?

32:10.077 --> 32:12.745
- I can't pass the tube.
- Help him, please. Help him!

32:12.912 --> 32:15.746
- Maybe I have to switch the tank.
- Do it, do it, do it.

32:15.913 --> 32:17.323
I'll try a cruciate incision.

32:24.836 --> 32:27.076
- You know what? Pull off my mask!
- What?

32:27.253 --> 32:31.463
Pull off my goggles, my mask. I can't see.
I can't breathe. Just do it! I don't care!

32:35.342 --> 32:37.000
Multifocal PVCs.

32:37.843 --> 32:39.585
Come on, Adam!

32:41.511 --> 32:45.803
- Lost the pulse. Starting CPR.
- Please. Please.

32:51.392 --> 32:53.514
There. There, there, there.

32:59.606 --> 33:02.012
Heart rate's up to 40.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.438
Sats are coming up.

33:08.944 --> 33:10.687
Strong carotid.

33:11.654 --> 33:13.860
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

33:14.572 --> 33:16.395
Thank you.

33:18.617 --> 33:23.246
Somalia was the site of the last naturally
acquired case of smallpox in 1977.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.659
- It's a pox. I know it.
- It's a cold sore.

33:25.836 --> 33:28.625
And I don't wanna think about
how you got it.

33:32.721 --> 33:34.181
What are you doing?

33:35.184 --> 33:36.892
That is completely illegal.

33:39.315 --> 33:41.985
- "Necessity has no laws."
- Hey, hey. Come on.

33:42.152 --> 33:43.433
Get your hands off!

33:44.781 --> 33:47.451
- Now, you are just peeing in there, right?
- Oh, shut up!

33:47.619 --> 33:49.861
I'm getting thirsty.

33:50.373 --> 33:53.328
Water's the best I can do for you, bro.

33:55.672 --> 33:58.211
- Does this help?
- No.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.508
Got a shy bladder, huh?

34:00.680 --> 34:02.507
Thanks.

34:03.141 --> 34:08.649
- Why aren't you guys talking?
- We don't have a lot in common.

34:09.317 --> 34:11.690
- Stan? You feel like singing?
- Yeah.

34:11.862 --> 34:14.105
I'm not in the mood.

34:36.148 --> 34:39.768
- His oxygen level's up to 95.
- So he's better?

34:39.945 --> 34:45.737
For now. The lesions are on the inside
too. There's still the risk of organ failure.

34:45.911 --> 34:47.455
But you can prevent that?

34:48.666 --> 34:51.503
We'll have to watch him very closely.

34:53.547 --> 34:55.542
How are you holding up?

34:57.178 --> 35:01.677
- Oh, I don't know.
- How about your husband?

35:02.687 --> 35:04.182
You'd have to ask him.

35:19.127 --> 35:22.997
Good news is, it's not the hemorrhagic
form, which is 98 percent fatal.

35:23.175 --> 35:25.501
That's a relief.

35:33.315 --> 35:36.234
Do you think it would have made
a difference?

35:36.403 --> 35:38.112
What?

35:39.575 --> 35:42.411
If I'd gotten to them sooner?

35:43.288 --> 35:45.447
Probably not.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.999
Abby, Dr. Lewis needs you.

35:55.764 --> 35:58.471
Really nice save, Carter.

36:01.941 --> 36:04.515
- Know what she wants?
- Setting up the vaccine clinic.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.982
- What does that have to do with me?
- I guess you're doing it.

36:10.077 --> 36:16.083
We need Ativan!
15 liters O-2 by mask. He needs a line.

36:16.461 --> 36:17.577
He needs a drink.

36:17.755 --> 36:20.711
He's having
an alcohol withdrawal seizure.

36:20.884 --> 36:23.887
Like I said, he needs a drink.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.884
- Okay, I'm in.
- Dr. Chen, 4 of Ativan.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.810
- Throw it.
- Get sux and etomidate.

36:30.399 --> 36:33.235
- Benzo's on board.
- I'm gonna bag him.

36:33.821 --> 36:37.405
- Pulse is weak and thready.
- He's cyanotic.

36:38.076 --> 36:39.536
Stan, damn it!

36:39.704 --> 36:43.917
You're not dying in here,
you hear me? Stan!

36:47.507 --> 36:51.839
- Guess he heard you. Sats are up.
- He's gonna need some Librium.

36:52.013 --> 36:54.173
Not for hours.

36:54.350 --> 36:56.594
That was exhausting.

36:56.770 --> 36:58.349
Oh, yeah.

37:04.950 --> 37:06.990
Prick the skin 15 times as shown here.

37:07.787 --> 37:09.198
This should be done rapidly...

37:09.373 --> 37:12.577
...in a perpendicular fashion
within a 5 mm diameter area.

37:12.752 --> 37:16.170
- You have enough room in here?
- If we clear this bed out, we'll be fine.

37:16.341 --> 37:18.916
- We took a vote.
- Excuse me?

37:19.095 --> 37:21.718
If we get the shot, we won't get sick.
We' re ready.

37:21.891 --> 37:25.095
- Yeah, unfortunately, that's not my call.
- Fine. Right here. Let's go.

37:25.271 --> 37:26.932
- We haven't started.
- You'll get it.

37:27.106 --> 37:29.266
- When?
- After we get confirmation.

37:29.443 --> 37:32.114
We're hot and starving to death.
You haven't done a thing!

37:32.281 --> 37:35.817
- We are running the tests right now.
- Let us leave. Call us when you know.

37:35.995 --> 37:39.697
- Move back and give us some room.
- Listen, jack-off! You move back!

37:39.875 --> 37:42.997
Okay, wait. I know you're frustrated.
I know you're upset.

37:43.172 --> 37:46.507
- Forget it. I'm not waiting anymore.
- We have to do things this way.

37:46.678 --> 37:48.469
- Stop stalling!
- You had your chance!

37:48.681 --> 37:50.970
- Forget the tests!
- Please, just relax. Okay?

37:51.142 --> 37:55.723
It's gonna be all right. Just relax. Please.

38:02.826 --> 38:04.903
- We can use this!
- Let's go!

38:06.498 --> 38:08.491
Come on!

38:08.918 --> 38:10.663
Move, move!

38:12.215 --> 38:13.709
Slow down, guys. Slow down!

38:13.884 --> 38:15.961
Hey, slow down!

38:22.689 --> 38:24.599
One, two, three!

38:27.946 --> 38:29.524
- Guys, you don't wanna-
- Move!

38:30.200 --> 38:32.870
One, two, three!

38:35.874 --> 38:38.033
- Keep going.
- One, two, three!

38:43.720 --> 38:44.965
Hey!

38:47.224 --> 38:50.392
- What is going on out there?
- I don't know.

39:00.995 --> 39:03.368
- Where's Abby?
- I don't know.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.913
- Why aren't we doing anything?
- I tried.

39:13.429 --> 39:15.257
- Something bad's happened.
- No answer?

39:15.432 --> 39:17.343
- Phone's dead.
- Go across the street.

39:17.518 --> 39:19.560
- What happened? Why?
- Expanding the perimeter.

39:19.730 --> 39:22.484
- Just a precaution.
- I need to speak to your supervisor.

39:22.651 --> 39:26.817
If I were you, I would go home
and be glad I didn't come to work today.

39:55.158 --> 40:01.163
This morning, a 5-year-old girl came in
with a rash that looked like smallpox.

40:01.417 --> 40:04.502
She died quickly.
Her older brother is still critical.

40:04.672 --> 40:08.968
We don't know what it is,
and we don't know how they got it.

40:09.136 --> 40:12.174
But it's here
and it needs to be contained.

40:13.059 --> 40:17.272
This is not about denying your civil
rights. This is about protecting you.

40:17.440 --> 40:21.938
If we let you go, you could carry
the disease home to your own families.

40:22.113 --> 40:26.742
So please stay here. Help us.

40:26.913 --> 40:29.285
And we'll all get through this.

40:41.058 --> 40:43.052
Yeah, okay, good.

40:44.105 --> 40:47.641
- Let's talk in two hours.
- What?

40:47.818 --> 40:50.571
Electron microscopy shows
a brick-shaped virus.

40:50.739 --> 40:51.984
- An orthopox?
- Right.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.068
- So it is smallpox.
- Not necessarily.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.579
- They're still running the PCR.
- How much longer?

40:57.749 --> 41:00.241
Make yourselves comfortable.

41:00.921 --> 41:02.202
Look at the bright side:

41:02.381 --> 41:05.633
Only two critical patients
and we're closed for paramedics.

41:05.803 --> 41:10.265
- So, what now?
- Well, we can watch ourselves on TV.

41:10.435 --> 41:13.105
So far, the only suspected cases
of smallpox...

41:13.272 --> 41:15.266
...are at County General in Chicago.

41:17.236 --> 41:21.616
-50 cc's of urine output in the last hour.
- Well, I guess that's something.

41:21.784 --> 41:24.276
- His kidneys are working.
- I cannot wait to leave.

41:24.455 --> 41:29.452
- I'm gonna take a two-hour shower.
- I'm gonna sleep for 24 hours.

41:30.964 --> 41:33.172
- How is he?
- He's stable.

41:33.343 --> 41:37.342
We know it's some form of orthopox,
so we need to limit contact.

41:37.516 --> 41:40.803
- Haven't we been doing that?
- You've been doing a great job.

41:40.979 --> 41:44.315
- The department would like to thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:44.484 --> 41:48.436
Unfortunately, the two of you are gonna
have to remain in this quarantine area.

41:48.616 --> 41:50.988
- Why? We're not infectious.
- Just a precaution.

41:51.161 --> 41:54.080
Why don't you just follow protocol
and give us the vaccine?

41:54.291 --> 41:57.376
As soon as we get final confirmation
on what we're dealing with.

41:57.879 --> 42:01.381
- It's smallpox.
- The U.S. hasn't seen this since 1949.

42:02.010 --> 42:07.054
Due to the unknown origin of this
outbreak, we're being extra cautious.

42:08.645 --> 42:10.389
Won't be much longer. Thanks, guys.

42:14.069 --> 42:16.194
Oh, man.

42:18.492 --> 42:19.904
How much does this suck?

42:20.078 --> 42:23.614
"The department would like to thank
you, but we can't bring you a fan."

42:23.792 --> 42:27.792
Is it me? It's like a sauna in here.
I'm soaked.

42:30.844 --> 42:32.921
- Do you have a fever?
- No!

42:33.097 --> 42:35.091
- Sit down.
- I'm fine.

42:35.268 --> 42:36.976
Sit down.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.434
- Take your temperature.
- I'm not infectious.

42:41.609 --> 42:44.447
Stick the thermometer in your ear.

42:49.913 --> 42:53.165
Today started out
like a normal day, huh?

42:57.049 --> 43:01.298
- See, 99. I told you.
- Okay.

43:02.474 --> 43:03.933
You're still hot.

43:05.270 --> 43:07.393
Is that better?

43:13.031 --> 43:15.702
Worst of this is over, right?

43:22.962 --> 43:25.633
Tell me we're gonna be okay.

43:42.157 --> 43:44.483
We're gonna be okay.

43:45.996 --> 43:48.316
We're gonna be okay.
