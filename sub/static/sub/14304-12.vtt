Who is it? What do you want?

00:52.653 --> 00:53.819
It's me, Star.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.888
Oh! Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.057
( sighs)
I always forget the chain.

00:59.692 --> 01:02.961
Star Butterfly
future Queen of Mewni.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.863
What do you want?
Look.

01:04.865 --> 01:07.633
( Glossaryck gasps in horror)

01:07.635 --> 01:10.702
I got the stain remover.
You go start the car!

01:10.704 --> 01:11.837
They're not dead.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.173
Oh...

01:14.175 --> 01:15.707
( strangled gasp )

01:15.709 --> 01:17.676
It's my spells.
They're all messed up.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.011
See?
Narwhal blast!

01:19.013 --> 01:20.646
Narwhal blast!

01:20.648 --> 01:22.214
Narwhal blast!
Narwhal blast!

01:22.216 --> 01:23.615
( gags )
Oh, you must stop.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.018
It's not your spells,
it's your wand.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.020
You see,
it's contaminated.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.289
( whispering )
Contamina... Whaa?

01:30.291 --> 01:31.690
How did that happen?

01:31.692 --> 01:35.060
The only way to find out
is to go into...

01:35.062 --> 01:36.195
( splash )
( muffled )
your wand.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.764
( surprised )
What? You can do that?

01:38.766 --> 01:40.933
Of course. But we won't.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.701
Why not?
Because...

01:42.703 --> 01:45.671
by decree of
Moon the Undaunted,
Queen of Mewni,

01:45.673 --> 01:48.674
you must be that tall
to go on this ride.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.175
( grumbles )
Mother...

01:51.744 --> 01:54.613
Well, I,
Star the Underestimated,

01:54.615 --> 01:56.215
future Queen of Mewni,

01:56.217 --> 01:57.783
hereby decree:

01:57.785 --> 01:59.885
Put me in my wand.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.221
Okay.
( high-pitched squeal )

02:02.223 --> 02:03.689
Now, there are
some things, young lady,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.124
you need to know
before we go inside.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.726
( mumbles excitedly )
Kay!

02:07.728 --> 02:10.762
The wand is
an extension of your your--

02:10.764 --> 02:12.764
( tapping )
Star, what are you doing?

02:12.766 --> 02:14.266
Are you- Are you going
to listen to me or not?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.834
( gasps )
Oh, sorry.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.770
As I was saying,
the wand...

02:18.772 --> 02:20.672
is an extension
of your memories.

02:20.674 --> 02:24.643
So you must find the thing
that does not belong.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.311
Find the thing
that doesn't belong.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.813
Good. Are you ready?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.681
Maybe.
( claps )

02:29.683 --> 02:31.683
All right. We're inside.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.185
What?
But we're still in my room.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.654
We're in the memory
of your room.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.923
Inside of your wand.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.224
( inhales loudly )

02:39.226 --> 02:44.229
Yes. From this point on,
it's very, very important

02:44.231 --> 02:46.665
that you listen only
to the sound of my voice.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.700
And nothing else.
( door opens )

02:48.702 --> 02:52.404
Uh... I'm kinda in
the middle of something
with Glossaryck.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.839
GLOSSARYCK: ( horrified )
No! No, Star.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.707
That is not Marco.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.443
Only listen to the sound
of my voice.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.412
Otherwise,
we will be separated.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.681
Hey. Have you seen my hoodie?
Marco, I told you.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.917
I am in
the middle of something
with Glossary...

03:04.919 --> 03:06.251
( gasps )

03:07.921 --> 03:09.354
( softly )
What?

03:09.356 --> 03:11.690
School?
( frustrated groan )

03:11.692 --> 03:14.126
Okay, Glossaryck, no.
I'm not going to school...

03:14.128 --> 03:15.694
in my memory...

03:15.696 --> 03:17.796
my wand memory--
( grunts )

03:18.831 --> 03:19.731
( softly )
What?

03:21.467 --> 03:23.335
( sighs )
Right, right, right.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.170
This is one
of those mind things.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.839
Where everywhere you go,
there's school.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.908
School. School. School!

03:29.910 --> 03:32.811
School. School. School.
( grunts )

03:33.813 --> 03:35.881
( door rattles )
School.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.716
I guess I'm going to school.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.952
( locker door creaks )

03:42.322 --> 03:43.722
( softly ) Whaa...

03:43.724 --> 03:45.424
That's Marco's.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.126
( gasps )
Well, this definitely
doesn't belong!

03:48.128 --> 03:49.728
Over, under,
around and through.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.130
Grab the little Mewni rabbit,
pull him through.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.765
( singsong )
Oh, Glossaryck!

03:53.767 --> 03:55.067
I found the thing
that doesn't belong!

03:55.069 --> 03:57.002
Beam me out!

03:57.004 --> 03:58.937
Or...
Beam me up.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.874
Uh... Glossaryck?

Hello?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.015
Oh, burger time.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.484
Don't mind if I do.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.219
( munching softly )

04:14.221 --> 04:15.887
Mmm. Memory burger.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.225
( bleats )
Oh, no!

04:20.227 --> 04:22.194
( bleats loudly )

04:22.196 --> 04:23.795
( grunts )

04:24.897 --> 04:26.431
( bleats )

04:26.433 --> 04:28.300
Your welcome!
( softly ) Who're you?

04:28.302 --> 04:29.468
Lil Chauncey.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.136
Lil Chauncey, Chauncey?

04:31.138 --> 04:32.838
( bleats )

04:32.840 --> 04:37.542
(playful)
I'm pretty sure you died
on the battlefield, mister!

04:37.544 --> 04:42.914
Hey Glossaryck!
I think I found the thing
that doesn't belong!

04:42.916 --> 04:47.919
That's my boot!
That's my boot!
Hey! Hey...

04:47.921 --> 04:50.188
( bleats happily )

04:53.459 --> 04:55.460
Hey, you!
Gimme back my boot!

04:55.462 --> 04:56.528
And get down!

04:56.530 --> 05:02.334
My father would be furious
if he caught you sitting
in his-- ( horrified gasp )

05:05.038 --> 05:07.806
( gasps ) Oh, Papa!
( softly ) I love you so much!

05:07.808 --> 05:10.342
( radio crackle )
Gloassaryck, I definitely
found the thing now.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.878
( loudspeaker screeches )
Can you come and pick me up
from school please?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.913
Aah! What is that?

05:20.019 --> 05:22.521
That definitely
doesn't belong.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.989
Let's go get it.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.194
( squish )
( fishing rod whirs )

05:29.196 --> 05:31.930
Move out, Lil Chauncey!
Hyaaah!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.933
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:38.004 --> 05:39.104
Hey!

05:40.039 --> 05:42.007
Uh... Hey.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.442
Where are you headed?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.977
Well, I was just
going to the foo-fo...

05:45.979 --> 05:47.846
Football field
and Mewni Castle...

05:47.848 --> 05:49.014
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.883
I'm Star Butterfly!

05:51.885 --> 05:53.452
Nuh-uh, you're not.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.886
Did you find the thing
that doesn't belong?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.455
N-n-not exactly...

05:56.457 --> 05:59.291
I mean I found Marco's hoodie
and my dad's chair and--

05:59.293 --> 06:01.159
( grunting )
Lil Chauncey here.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.295
( bleats )
( grunts )

06:03.297 --> 06:04.496
Wait a minute.
( sighs )

06:04.498 --> 06:05.897
Why are there
two of us here?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.199
Didn't Glossaryck tell you?

06:07.201 --> 06:09.034
If you're inside
your wand too long,

06:09.036 --> 06:11.269
all your new memories
become your old memories.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.871
Until eventually
your current timeline

06:12.873 --> 06:15.040
is overwritten
by the future
versions of yourself,

06:15.042 --> 06:16.441
like me!

06:16.443 --> 06:18.410
Star Butterfly!

06:18.412 --> 06:21.046
Wait...
so, you're gonna
replace me?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.881
( laughing ) Yeah!
But don't worry.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.449
You'll never know
the difference.

06:25.985 --> 06:27.219
I gotta go.
( squeals loudly )

06:27.221 --> 06:29.955
( bleats )

06:29.957 --> 06:31.623
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.393
( threatening )
Stay out of my timeline.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.329
( sweetly )
Thanks!

06:37.331 --> 06:40.932
Fine. I'll just get
my own timeline. Moody.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.401
STAR:
I guess I'm going to school.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.969
Hey!

06:47.340 --> 06:49.007
( bleating loudly )

06:49.009 --> 06:50.342
Hello!

06:50.344 --> 06:52.010
Go away!

06:53.179 --> 06:55.013
( Stars calling
one after another )
Hello! Hello! Hello!

06:55.015 --> 06:56.348
( gasps )
Okay...

06:57.583 --> 06:59.251
( door creeks open )

06:59.253 --> 07:00.952
( door creaks shut )

07:00.954 --> 07:02.587
Oh! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.022
Whoa...

07:04.024 --> 07:05.957
This is the grandma room.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.093
Oh, I haven't been in here
since I was a little baby.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.561
( grunts and gasps )

07:09.563 --> 07:12.631
Are you nuts?!
There's no eating
in the grandma room!

07:12.633 --> 07:15.033
You'll get crumbs
everywhere!
( loud thud )

07:15.035 --> 07:16.401
( clattering )
( Star gasps )

07:16.403 --> 07:18.970
( slow grating )

07:26.946 --> 07:28.246
( loud thud )

07:29.515 --> 07:31.183
Oh, no, no, no.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.086
We got burger juice
on the wall rug, Chauncey.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.588
( inhales nervously )
( squelch )

07:36.590 --> 07:38.089
( shouting in panic )
Oh, no! We're gonna die!

07:38.091 --> 07:40.492
( grating )

07:42.662 --> 07:44.996
Celena the Shy?

07:44.998 --> 07:47.966
Ooh...great,
great grandma Shy!

07:47.968 --> 07:50.268
What hides behind
the golden fan,

07:50.270 --> 07:52.170
the hand does sweetly hold

07:52.172 --> 07:55.140
a trove of cosmic secrets
that never will be told.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.609
( whispering )
Don't be shy!

07:57.611 --> 07:59.144
You can tell me.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.313
Right, Chauncey?
Chauncey?

08:01.315 --> 08:04.082
Noo! No, no, no!
Get a hold of yourself,
Chauncey!

08:04.084 --> 08:05.250
( Chauncey grunts )

08:05.252 --> 08:08.553
Solaria the Monster Carver.
( gasps in awe )

08:08.555 --> 08:11.156
A castle stormed
is a hero born

08:11.158 --> 08:13.425
with might as strong as steel.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.260
Kneels the void before her

08:15.262 --> 08:17.996
and the crushing force
she wields.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.165
( bleating loudly )
Chauncey, come back!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.666
( hisses softly )

08:21.668 --> 08:22.767
( gasps ) Oh.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.704
Eclipsa, Queen of Mewni

08:25.706 --> 08:28.006
to a Mewmen King was wed.
( inhales sharply )

08:28.008 --> 08:30.208
But took a monster
for her love

08:30.210 --> 08:32.511
and away from Mewni fled.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.012
( shudders )
Bad girl...

08:34.014 --> 08:36.214
( grunting )
What is it, boy?
What'd you find?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.582
( bleating loudly )

08:37.584 --> 08:40.051
Aww, that's you, isn't it?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.187
Before you died.
( gasps )

08:42.189 --> 08:44.122
that means this
is Mom's tapestry!

08:45.391 --> 08:47.025
Get off!
( bleats )

08:47.027 --> 08:49.761
The immortal monster
will long be haunted

08:49.763 --> 08:53.565
by the darkest spell
of Moon the Undaunted.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.302
My mom fought Toffee?

08:58.404 --> 09:00.138
( squeaking )

09:01.541 --> 09:03.808
( squeaking )
( clattering )

09:09.081 --> 09:10.649
( effort grunting )

09:11.751 --> 09:13.585
( gasps )
( heavy breathing )

09:13.587 --> 09:15.587
Glossaryck! You're back!

09:15.589 --> 09:19.324
Oh! Do you have any idea
how difficult that was?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.459
Sorry. Moody.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.229
No, no.
( exhales ) It's fine.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.299
And-and did you find
the thing that doesn't belong?

09:27.301 --> 09:30.468
Well, I found Marco's hoodie,
and my dad's chair.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.137
And Lil' Chauncey over there.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.772
( growls and squeals )
( loud ripping )

09:35.241 --> 09:38.109
But all these things...
belong in my memories.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.579
Listen to me.
Did you see yourself?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.080
Uh-huh...

09:42.082 --> 09:43.548
All right. That's not good.
That's not good.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.184
We gotta get out of here.
Step into my eyeball.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.253
I-- Yes.
That's what I said.
Come on. Hop in.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.221
Wait! But I--
I didn't fix my wand!
( rip )

09:55.761 --> 09:57.228
( gasps in astonishment )

09:58.698 --> 10:01.700
That's the thing
that doesn't belong!

10:01.702 --> 10:04.603
( Stars echoing )
That's the thing
that doesn't belong!

10:05.871 --> 10:08.540
Star! We've gotta go now.
Get into my eye.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.379
All right, that's it!

10:14.381 --> 10:15.814
( Glossaryck shouts )

10:17.149 --> 10:19.250
( pop )
( squish )

10:19.252 --> 10:20.752
( squelch )

10:20.754 --> 10:23.121
Oh! Boy, that hurt.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.289
( pop )
Ugh...

10:24.291 --> 10:25.557
Pupil juice.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.525
( gasps )
Glossaryck.
What?

10:29.495 --> 10:30.629
I think we did it.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.265
Yeah. That's kinda gross.
Let's get rid of it.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.272
Uh... That's not exactly
what I meant.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.142
You know what? ( sighs )
I think my mom was right.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.311
I'm not tall enough
to go on this ride.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.318
I'm not tall enough
to go on any ride.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.220
But I've been on them all.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.657
Your, uh...
Your eyeball...

10:58.659 --> 11:00.325
is uh... ( softly )
falling out a little bit.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.294
Oh, thanks. Thank you.
Let me just, uh...
( laughs )

11:03.296 --> 11:04.629
You gonna test out that wand?

11:04.631 --> 11:07.165
I think I've had
enough magic for one day.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.366
Hey!
Have you seen my hoodie?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.702
( screams and grunts )
( groans in pain )

11:10.704 --> 11:12.270
It worked!

11:14.674 --> 11:17.275
This is the best
makeover ever!

11:18.811 --> 11:21.513
This princess looks fly-ayy

11:21.515 --> 11:23.682
and she's ready to partay!

11:23.684 --> 11:25.717
Ladies!
What's up with your lips?

11:26.819 --> 11:29.888
Don't be hate'n 'cause
we look good and you don't!

11:29.890 --> 11:31.723
What are you talking about?
I look all right.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.325
Marco! Why don't you
tell Ponyhead what we got her?

11:34.327 --> 11:36.728
Uhh... we got you
something special for
your first friendship--

11:36.730 --> 11:38.263
( singsong )
Friendship Thursday!

11:38.265 --> 11:40.365
Hook a girl up already!

11:40.367 --> 11:42.867
It's a friendship snuggly!

11:42.869 --> 11:45.270
Uh... great.
Thanks, guys...

11:45.272 --> 11:47.305
But how are we
gonna dance in this?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.574
We're not going dancing, silly!

11:50.776 --> 11:52.277
Excuse me, what?
( phone rings )

11:53.646 --> 11:55.380
Fifteen minutes
to show time!

11:57.850 --> 11:59.350
I'm gonna go get the pizza.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.886
( whining )
Pizza?
Yeah!

12:01.888 --> 12:04.522
You can't watch
"Fiesta de la Noche"
without pizza!

12:04.524 --> 12:06.424
Fist full of what the what?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.792
It's this awesome telanovela

12:07.794 --> 12:10.361
about three friends
that go out every night

12:10.363 --> 12:11.763
and have all sorts of fun!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.431
Uh... ( chuckles )
Okay, yeah.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.866
We're just gonna
sit on the couch

12:14.868 --> 12:17.569
and watch other people party
on that rectangle box thing.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.003
( laughs )
Okay. Go on.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.605
( giggles )
Oh, yeah, baby!

12:20.607 --> 12:22.674
That's what
Friendship Thursday

12:22.676 --> 12:24.309
( softly )
is all about.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.578
( spits )

12:26.580 --> 12:28.346
Uh... I have to go
to the bathroom.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.252
Hey, hey!
Looking good, Marco!

12:34.254 --> 12:35.754
Thanks, Mr. Vendrosian!

12:35.756 --> 12:37.589
You're lookin' good yourself!

12:37.591 --> 12:40.291
Hey, Marco!
My watch stopped.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.293
Can you tell me
what day it is?

12:42.295 --> 12:43.962
You know what day it is.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.730
Friendship Thursday!

12:45.732 --> 12:47.499
Um...

12:47.501 --> 12:50.268
Uh, actually,
it's my birthday.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.438
I thought you knew.

12:54.673 --> 12:55.774
Poneyhead...

12:57.309 --> 12:58.510
Please go back to the house.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.379
( annoyed )
Huh...

13:01.381 --> 13:03.648
Alright, I'm gonna
squeeze past you here.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.350
Sorry.
( whispering ) Weirdo.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.021
Ponyhead...

13:10.023 --> 13:14.692
Come on!
I want to see some
Earthian night life!

13:14.694 --> 13:18.463
I'm just picking up the pizza
and getting it back
before the show starts.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.998
Let's go.
No.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
( whining loudly )
Please!

13:22.402 --> 13:25.770
No!
( screaming )
Please!

13:25.772 --> 13:28.439
( singsong whining )
Please!

13:28.441 --> 13:30.942
( groans audibly )
Okay, fine!

13:30.944 --> 13:32.744
You can come.
Yeah!

13:32.746 --> 13:34.078
Woohoo!

13:34.080 --> 13:36.581
Just none of that Poneyhead
stuff you always do.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.750
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

13:38.752 --> 13:41.352
Just promise
we're gonna go get the pizza

13:41.354 --> 13:42.620
and nothing else.
( Ponyhead sighs )

13:42.622 --> 13:44.455
( groaning )
Fine!

13:44.457 --> 13:45.623
I pinky promise.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.325
( gagging loudly )

13:47.327 --> 13:48.326
( coughs )

13:48.328 --> 13:49.894
I'm not touching that.

13:51.630 --> 13:54.666
So, what's this pizza thing
you guys keep talking about?

13:54.668 --> 13:56.901
Whoa-a-a-a Nelliee!

13:56.903 --> 14:00.071
Did you just call
Emilio's Pizza "a thing"?

14:00.073 --> 14:01.940
Uh... I guess.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.075
Emilio's Pizza
is not a thing.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.344
His family has been
making pizza forever.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.848
His recipes goes back
to a time before pizza
even existed.

14:09.850 --> 14:13.051
Oh, my gogo!
Look at those skinny jeans!

14:13.053 --> 14:15.854
Those are some
skinny-skinny jeans.
Like very skinny.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.056
What are you doing?
Okay, come on!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.524
Let me just go in
and get a pair.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.359
It'll just take a second.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.595
You promised.
No distrac--
( bell dings )

14:24.563 --> 14:25.864
Really?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.866
Check me out, Marco!

14:27.868 --> 14:30.501
Excuse me!
Are those skinny jeans?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.904
Why, yes, they are.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.673
No way!
I'm wearing skinny jeans!

14:35.675 --> 14:38.409
( electronic music playing )
( Skinny Jeans gang partying )

14:38.411 --> 14:44.082
( all cheering and hooting )

14:44.084 --> 14:47.085
MARCO: Poneyhead!

14:47.087 --> 14:50.388
Hey, Ponyhead!

14:50.390 --> 14:51.923
The pizza! Remember?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.424
( sirens screech )

14:53.426 --> 14:54.726
Everybody freeze!

14:54.728 --> 14:56.427
I'm shutting this party down.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.799
Till we get
Little Red Riding Hood there
into a pair of skinny jeans!

15:02.835 --> 15:04.535
( pants squeaking )
( Marco grunting )

15:06.605 --> 15:08.773
When you promised
we'd just get the pizza!

15:08.775 --> 15:10.408
How does that fit into this?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.644
Oh, shut up, baby girl.
You know you look good.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.513
Check it out, Marco.
I got us a cab.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.848
Oh. Great.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.585
Uh, we're going
to Emilio's pizza.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.488
( nervous exhale )
Just take the car.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.089
Don't hurt me!

15:25.091 --> 15:26.991
I don't think this is a taxi.

15:26.993 --> 15:30.128
Oh, don't blame me!
It's not my fault that
people like to give me stuff!

15:30.130 --> 15:31.529
What did you--

15:32.598 --> 15:33.965
( tires screech )

15:39.204 --> 15:41.205
( cars honking loudly )

15:43.742 --> 15:45.543
Okay, Marco,
tell me how to get there!

15:45.545 --> 15:47.478
Pony! You need
to stop this car right now!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.447
Come on. Just tell me
and I'll drive us there!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.482
Stop the car.
Tell me how to get there.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.051
Stop the car.
But tell me
how to get there.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.452
Stop the car.
Tell me how to--

15:54.454 --> 15:56.788
( Marco screams )

16:00.826 --> 16:02.593
Gah!
( panicked breathing )

16:02.595 --> 16:04.595
I-uh-- I --
( screams )

16:05.664 --> 16:07.632
Uh... Okay.
What are you doing?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.000
We just stole this thing!

16:09.002 --> 16:13.538
( panicking )
We gotta get as far away
from this as possible.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.006
And then report it
to the police.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.941
( crash )

16:16.943 --> 16:18.843
MARCO: ( crying )
No! No, no, no, no!

16:20.946 --> 16:22.947
( shrieks )
( metal crunching )

16:22.949 --> 16:24.048
( strangled scream )

16:26.518 --> 16:28.653
Aww, it's so compact.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.189
( sobbing )
I'm totally going to jail!

16:31.191 --> 16:32.724
You're not
going to jail, Marco!

16:35.627 --> 16:37.862
PONYHEAD:
Go home to daddy, baby!

16:37.864 --> 16:40.164
( honking )
( engine rumbles )

16:40.166 --> 16:42.500
Okay, let's go
get us another car!

16:42.502 --> 16:45.103
How about you stop doing
all that Ponyhead business
we talked about...

16:45.105 --> 16:47.839
and let me get us there?
Fine.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.609
Hey, up there!
How much for a ride
to Emilio's Pizza?

16:51.611 --> 16:54.078
Uh... $650?

16:55.581 --> 16:57.015
( sighs )
Okay...

16:58.584 --> 17:00.118
( engine rumbles )

17:03.288 --> 17:04.856
Okay, okay...
( inhales )

17:04.858 --> 17:07.191
Everything's still in order.
( breathing heavily )

17:07.193 --> 17:08.559
We're here...

17:08.561 --> 17:09.927
Keep it cool--
Oh, my gogo!

17:09.929 --> 17:12.096
It smells like
tomatoes and cologne.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

17:14.801 --> 17:17.769
You can't just saunter
in there with your... sass.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.571
This is Emilio's.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.873
( stressing )
Emilio's!

17:21.875 --> 17:23.641
For once today just...

17:23.643 --> 17:24.909
let me handle this.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.046
Let me handle this.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.647
( bell dings )

17:30.582 --> 17:32.283
Just sit here...

17:32.285 --> 17:35.853
or float here
in the corner.
Don't say a word.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.056
( singing )
Hey, Marco!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.590
( singing )
Hey, Emilio!

17:39.592 --> 17:41.025
( both singing )

17:42.594 --> 17:43.961
Good to see you, kid.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.229
Here you go, Bubba.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.731
( excited exhale )

17:46.733 --> 17:48.099
May I?
Go ahead.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.567
After it's left my oven...

17:49.569 --> 17:51.002
it's not my baby.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.370
( excitedly mumbling )

17:55.574 --> 17:56.741
Huh...

17:56.743 --> 17:57.742
Everything okay?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.944
Uh, yeah.
Everything's great.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.713
Well... ( sighs )
Are you sure?

18:02.715 --> 18:06.184
You know th-that face
I've never seen you make.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.086
No, no.
It's-it's nothing.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.154
I'll just, uh...
live with it.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.756
Oh. Okay.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.094
( sighs heavily )
Actually...

18:16.096 --> 18:17.995
The thing is...

18:17.997 --> 18:19.831
it's the mushrooms.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.300
There aren't
as many mushrooms
as they usually are.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.168
Not as many mushrooms?
Let me see...

18:24.170 --> 18:27.238
It's-it's totally-
it's not a big deal at all.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.706
Okay.

18:29.675 --> 18:30.741
One...

18:30.743 --> 18:31.909
Two...
No.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.644
Three...
No, don't.
Don't count.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.647
Four... Five...
Please don't count.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.782
Six... seven... eight...

18:37.784 --> 18:40.151
Okay, stop. Stop counting.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.652
Ninety-one,
ninety-two, ninety three...

18:41.654 --> 18:43.621
Let's not play
the number game, you know?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.858
Ninety-four,
ninety-five, ninety-six...

18:46.860 --> 18:48.192
( sighs )

18:48.194 --> 18:49.861
Ninety-seven!

18:49.863 --> 18:52.196
Ninety-eight...

18:52.198 --> 18:57.635
Usually I put...
Put a hundred mushrooms
on a pizza, but there's--

18:57.637 --> 19:00.972
All this time I thought
I was making good pizza.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.373
( squelch )
( trash can rattles )

19:03.775 --> 19:05.977
Uhh, President
of the United States liked it!

19:05.979 --> 19:07.812
The Nobel Peace Prize liked it.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.680
None of that matters...

19:09.682 --> 19:11.716
because it wasn't good enough

19:11.718 --> 19:14.085
( menacingly )
for Marco Diaz.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.320
Well, don't beat
yourself up about it.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.688
N-n-nobody's perfect.
( phone rings )

19:17.690 --> 19:20.791
Emilio's Pizza.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.760
I-I-I-- Let me just
stop you right there.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.762
I cannot take your order.
( muffled talking over phone )

19:24.764 --> 19:27.365
Well! Because I cannot make
a perfect pizza!

19:27.367 --> 19:29.066
( muffled talking over phone )

19:29.068 --> 19:30.735
Oh, well, thank you.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.670
That's very sweet of you.
I appreciate that.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.704
( muffled talking over phone )

19:33.706 --> 19:35.706
I think it's very good myself,

19:35.708 --> 19:37.742
but perfection
is a very high bar.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.844
So, as of right now, I quit!

19:39.846 --> 19:41.979
( muffled talking over phone )
Goodbye, and have a nice life.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.347
( over phone )
<i>Why are you yelling at me?</i>

19:43.349 --> 19:44.815
I am not yelling, sir!

19:44.817 --> 19:47.151
No, no. You are yelling.
Lower your voice!

19:51.690 --> 19:53.090
Not a word.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.825
I wasn't gonna say anything.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.427
You know,
this is all your fault.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.862
With all your Ponyhead stuff.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.864
Ooh, excuse me?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.933
I knew Friendship Thursday
wasn't your thing!

20:01.935 --> 20:04.735
TV and pizza
sounds boring to you.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.904
But it's what Star and I
like to do on Thursdays!

20:06.906 --> 20:09.173
Okay! Well, why did you
even invite me then? ( scoffs )

20:09.175 --> 20:10.741
I didn't invite you!

20:10.743 --> 20:12.410
When you're around,
everything goes bad!

20:12.412 --> 20:17.715
Fine! There's no room
for the three of us
in this friend--

20:17.717 --> 20:20.218
( bell dings )
Is Emilio here?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.752
He's gone.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.854
Indefinitely.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.823
Oh, okay.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.094
Do you know why I like pizza?

20:30.096 --> 20:31.862
No one cares.
There's something else
going on.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.098
It's divided
into equal portions

20:34.100 --> 20:36.400
so everybody gets
the same amount.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.737
And, it's got no sharp edges
to stab someone with.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.373
Because it's round.
Like the circle of friendship.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.375
And I like the cwust!

20:47.512 --> 20:49.146
Truce?

20:49.148 --> 20:50.982
Truce!

20:50.984 --> 20:52.883
How do you feel
about making a pizza

20:52.885 --> 20:54.252
with a hundred mushrooms?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.287
Oh, yeah, Boy!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.847
<i>( people cheering )</i>

21:25.984 --> 21:27.818
Uh... guys?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.887
( Both snoring )

21:32.090 --> 21:34.125
( softly )
Emilio's...

21:34.127 --> 21:35.893
( gags )

21:35.895 --> 21:38.562
( spits )
Way too many mushrooms.
