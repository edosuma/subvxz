WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.436
Hey, Katie.
Hi, uh, Teddy and I
want to show Emme

00:04.438 --> 00:06.105
<i> The Princess Bride.</i>
Is she old enough?

00:06.107 --> 00:07.606
Yeah. Well, uh, wait.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.508
Yes.
Yes. Like I said, yes.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.211
Oh, man.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.279
Teddy never puts away his iPad.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.282
Oh, my God.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.317
What?

00:18.319 --> 00:19.718
See for yourself.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.188
That's a naked lady.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.325
On Teddy's iPad.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.659
He's 11.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.561
And there's a naked lady
on his iPad?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.465
That's not so bad--
it's just the top half.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.435
God,
I can't believe

00:36.437 --> 00:39.471
Teddy's going online and looking
at pictures of naked women.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.441
And then leaving
the computer out.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.109
Rookie mistake.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.413
That doesn't sound like him.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.048
Wait a minute...

00:53.154 --> 00:54.520
Was this you?

00:54.522 --> 00:55.788
No.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.356
I like a little
more of a story.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.757
I'm old-fashioned.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.761
Hey, come on, don't you
supervise him when he's online?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.297
<i> When</i> he's online?
He's online all the time.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.365
If I was
gonna watch

01:06.367 --> 01:08.100
what he's doing, I'd have to...

01:08.102 --> 01:11.203
quit my job and give
the other two kids away.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.472
Oh, I know.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.241
My precious, innocent Teddy

01:16.243 --> 01:18.077
isn't so innocent anymore.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.546
Now he's-he's just like...

01:20.548 --> 01:22.214
one of you.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.550
Hey.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.752
She's not wrong.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.288
(stammers)
Look at her.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.356
I mean, why is it always
some hoochie mama?

01:31.358 --> 01:33.692
I mean, where
are the naked doctors?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.627
Naked astronauts?

01:35.629 --> 01:37.696
Naked presidents?

01:37.698 --> 01:39.364
They're out there.
Put dot com

01:39.366 --> 01:41.333
at the end of any one of those,
you'll find it.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.435
Okay, look... we can't just

01:43.437 --> 01:44.870
let Teddy sit around

01:44.872 --> 01:47.439
and look at the top half
of naked women.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.808
W-What are you gonna do?
What am<i> I</i> gonna do?

01:49.810 --> 01:52.344
Yeah.
Oh, no, no.
<i>You</i> are gonna have

01:52.346 --> 01:53.612
the birds and the bees talk
with him.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.614
Oh, the talk?

01:56.550 --> 01:59.485
Oh...

01:59.487 --> 02:01.420
Well, can't that wait until

02:01.422 --> 02:03.322
he starts looking
at the bottom half?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.390
Because that's where

02:05.392 --> 02:07.526
the questions come in.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.262
No, Adam,
there's no avoiding this.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.898
I do the girls,
you do the boy.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.366
It's your job.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.501
All right, fine,
I'll handle it.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.835
Thank you.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.403
Oh, and when you talk to him,

02:18.405 --> 02:20.239
d-don't mention
the pictures, okay?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.707
We don't want there to be
any shame involved.

02:21.709 --> 02:25.444
How do I talk about
this stuff without shame?

02:25.446 --> 02:26.879
They go hand in hand.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.380
Yeah, shame's
what makes it hot.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.748
Ye...

02:29.750 --> 02:33.285
No, we're not trying
to make it hot, Don.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.421
No, and if you want, um,

02:36.423 --> 02:37.823
I got this book

02:37.825 --> 02:39.858
to give Kate the talk.
Oh.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.560
And the book came with these two

02:41.562 --> 02:44.730
anatomically correct dolls,
Sandy and Randy.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.535
Educational body buddies.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.571
They look just like regular
dolls.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.206
Oh, well, um...

02:54.208 --> 02:56.175
take a look
under that Velcro flap.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.948
Oh!

03:02.950 --> 03:05.884
Looks like Randy just
got out of the pool.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.621
¶ ¶

03:21.302 --> 03:23.368
Teddy.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.604
Hi, Dad.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.307
Hey, buddy, uh...

03:31.312 --> 03:32.511
You know,

03:32.513 --> 03:35.247
I was just thinking that, uh,

03:35.249 --> 03:38.283
maybe we should have
a conversation

03:38.285 --> 03:41.820
about where babies come from.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.488
So, why don't you tell me
what you know,

03:43.490 --> 03:45.557
and, uh, I'll fill in the rest.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.328
Okay.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.863
Well, a man and a woman

03:51.865 --> 03:54.499
lie down together,
usually in a bed.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.868
Ah, you're a traditionalist.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.770
I like it.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.774
Then a golden egg
appears between them.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.548
Uh, a what now?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.749
A golden egg.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.953
The woman eats it and a few
months later she has a baby.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.890
Uh-huh.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.393
Then the man falls asleep

04:21.395 --> 04:23.462
and the woman yells at him.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.436
You nailed it, boss.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.405
Yeah.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.007
There you go. Okay.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.816
How did it go with the boy?

04:44.818 --> 04:48.387
Well, one of us is wrong
about where babies come from.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.694
And, uh, I'm pretty sure
it's him.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.831
So he didn't know anything?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.633
No. So I bailed.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.403
And I think that's
okay. I mean,

05:04.405 --> 05:06.071
no one ever
had the talk with me.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.840
I did. When you were eight.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.809
I told you babies
came out of your butt.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.411
And you believed me.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.551
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.354
That was not cool.
Every time I went

05:22.356 --> 05:23.388
to the bathroom I was afraid

05:23.390 --> 05:25.657
I was gonna have a baby.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.461
I got to go back up there.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.396
Even I know
that's the right thing to do.
Yeah.

05:31.398 --> 05:34.733
Hey, come with me. If the two
of us are there, it'll seem...

05:34.735 --> 05:37.436
it'll seem more like
a casual conversation.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.670
Okay, yeah.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.072
We're family.
Mm.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.341
We help each other out.
Okay.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.549
(door closes)

05:53.053 --> 05:55.887
Teddy.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.389
Yeah?

05:57.391 --> 06:00.092
So, uh...

06:00.094 --> 06:02.561
turns out that your

06:02.563 --> 06:05.630
golden egg theory
was a little off.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.933
So I'm here

06:07.935 --> 06:09.568
to give you
the real story.

06:09.570 --> 06:13.372
And I brought two
friends of mine.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.773
This is Sandy

06:14.775 --> 06:16.808
and this is Randy.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.678
And they really, really
love each other.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.482
Okay, uh...

06:25.619 --> 06:29.054
hold on to your hat.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.590
And, uh, that's
pretty much that.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.027
Now, I know it's a lot

06:36.029 --> 06:37.729
to take in,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.131
but, uh...

06:48.575 --> 06:51.543
You, uh, you doing
okay there, buddy?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.515
I, uh...

07:06.160 --> 07:08.894
Here's ten dollars. Buy
yourself something nice, okay?

07:11.498 --> 07:13.899
Oh, hey, honey, I have a-a
safety meeting at the hospital,

07:13.901 --> 07:17.602
but I brought home
some pizza for the...

07:19.940 --> 07:21.840
What happened to you?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.809
Well...

07:23.811 --> 07:26.111
I just put on
a pornographic puppet show

07:26.113 --> 07:28.814
for my only son.

07:28.816 --> 07:32.484
Well, hey, you had the talk
with Teddy, that's great.

07:32.486 --> 07:36.121
(scoffs)
Yeah, and a puppet show,
you found a way to make it fun.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.491
I wouldn't call it fun.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.659
I was just
gonna give him

07:40.661 --> 07:42.093
the basics, but..

07:42.095 --> 07:43.495
he kept staring at me.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.529
So I kept

07:44.531 --> 07:45.964
filling the silences

07:45.966 --> 07:47.666
with more detail.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.834
You know, and,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.202
and the quieter he got,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.571
the more I explained, and...

07:52.573 --> 07:54.840
and then, 'cause I thought
I'd never see happiness

07:54.842 --> 07:56.975
in my son's eyes again,

07:56.977 --> 07:59.878
I gave him ten dollars.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.014
Okay, well, I-I don't know
if combining money and sex

08:03.016 --> 08:05.650
is a great first lesson.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.053
I was buying a ticket
out of that room.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.488
I would have paid anything.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.755
(groans)

08:10.757 --> 08:12.023
Was it this
horrible when you

08:12.025 --> 08:13.592
had the talk with Katie?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.026
No, but, you know,

08:15.028 --> 08:16.528
mothers and daughters
understand each other.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.731
There's a lot more
unsaid than said.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.967
Oh, I had to explain everything.

08:21.969 --> 08:25.570
Starting with what goes where.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.639
He had no idea about the where.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.907
And, honestly,

08:28.909 --> 08:30.809
he was a little hazy
on the what.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.979
He... But he has a what.

08:33.981 --> 08:37.516
He doesn't know
what the what's for.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.751
Okay, but he-he was
looking at those pictures,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.119
he must have known something.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.587
Not a clue.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.922
A-And the new information?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.258
He doesn't love it.
You know what, honey,

08:46.260 --> 08:49.561
he just, he needs some time
to process this, that's all.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.829
Like that time
in the mall bathroom

08:50.831 --> 08:53.298
when he saw Santa Claus
at the urinal.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.667
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, and Santa said to Teddy

08:55.669 --> 08:59.004
"I'm sorry, I couldn't
ho-ho-hold it." Yeah.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.173
Yeah, I know.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.843
I mean, he got through that,
he'll get through this too.

09:04.845 --> 09:08.246
I don't know. Explaining to him
what men and women do,

09:08.248 --> 09:09.714
saying it out loud?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.250
I was just as shocked as he was.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.722
We should be ashamed
of ourselves.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.624
Oh, you're in bad shape.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.092
Yeah.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.761
Uh, look, honey,
I'm sorry, I can't get out

09:22.763 --> 09:23.929
of this meeting, but I...
It's okay.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.063
I'm really proud of you

09:25.065 --> 09:26.331
for handling this.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.599
You want
some crackers

09:27.601 --> 09:29.734
for your tummy?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.236
Yeah, that-that sounds nice.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.737
Thank you. Okay.
Okay.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.105
I'll, um...
(clears throat)

09:34.107 --> 09:35.840
I'll get home as-as
soon as I can.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.909
All right.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.148
(door closes)

09:44.718 --> 09:46.818
Hey!

09:48.589 --> 09:49.788
You're moving, that's good.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.656
(chuckles)

09:51.658 --> 09:52.857
Why did you tell me that stuff?

09:52.859 --> 09:55.093
I thought we were friends.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.729
Well...

09:57.731 --> 10:00.765
because of the pictures.

10:00.767 --> 10:01.766
What pictures?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.034
The ones you were looking at

10:03.036 --> 10:04.135
on your iPad last night.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.770
I wasn't on my iPad last night.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.871
Kate borrowed it.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.609
Katie?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.811
Why would Katie
be looking at that stuff?

10:12.813 --> 10:15.380
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.250
I'm gonna take my pizza
out to the swing set

10:19.252 --> 10:20.952
and remember what it was
like to be a child.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.056
Okay, buddy.
(chuckles)

10:25.058 --> 10:27.892
Hey, uh, Teddy, listen, um...

10:29.262 --> 10:32.897
That thing we talked about
upstairs, right?

10:32.899 --> 10:34.899
It's good.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.970
Even when it's bad...

10:38.972 --> 10:42.240
it's good.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.975
Can we stop talking now?

10:43.977 --> 10:46.411
Yeah, okay.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.653
Why do you have Teddy's iPad?

10:54.655 --> 10:55.720
Well, because there
are some very

10:55.722 --> 10:57.789
interesting pictures on it.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.291
Why are you telling me?
I never had it.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.826
Oh, well, he says you did.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.928
Hey, let's go question him
together.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.363
I'll be the good cop,

11:05.365 --> 11:06.631
and, you, you be the cop

11:06.632 --> 11:07.898
that lies about being
on the iPad.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.167
Come on.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.803
Okay. Fine, it was me.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.039
Wh...?

11:14.041 --> 11:16.207
Why?

11:16.209 --> 11:18.410
I was getting changed for gym,
and...

11:18.412 --> 11:21.246
some girls have small ones
and some girls have big ones

11:21.248 --> 11:23.314
and some girls have...
really weird ones and I just,

11:23.316 --> 11:25.316
I wanted to see what the
average was, I don't know.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.252
I-I don't want to talk about
it and everything's fine.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.921
O-Okay. Okay, I get it.
That, uh...

11:29.923 --> 11:33.692
that makes sense.
(chuckles)

11:40.200 --> 11:43.201
Here's ten dollars. Go buy
yourself something nice, okay?

11:47.207 --> 11:50.108
(sighs)

11:51.244 --> 11:52.877
Look, honey...

11:52.879 --> 11:54.713
I think you're perfect.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.032
Okay? And,

11:57.033 --> 11:59.350
in the future, when you have
questions like this,

11:59.352 --> 12:02.220
just ask Mom.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.455
Okay?
Because...

12:03.457 --> 12:05.423
she gave you
the birds and the bees talk,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.960
so you already have,
you know, open channels.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.862
We never had a talk about that.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.466
What? She never showed you
any dolls?

12:14.468 --> 12:15.968
Wh-What?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.469
Dirty dolls--
have you seen them?

12:17.471 --> 12:21.106
No, I learned all about that
stuff in health class at school.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.007
What? They still teach that?

12:23.009 --> 12:25.276
I could've stayed completely out
of this?

12:25.278 --> 12:29.280
Oh, I have been misinformed
about a lot of things lately!

12:29.282 --> 12:32.751
It's butt babies
all over again!

12:35.522 --> 12:38.323
Hey, honey.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.958
How was your night? How's Teddy?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.793
Not bad, liar.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.464
What?

12:46.466 --> 12:49.501
A lot happened tonight
while you were gone.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.302
Yeah.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.971
Turns out it was Katie
who was looking

12:52.973 --> 12:54.472
at those pictures
on the Internet.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.174
Are you serious?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.842
Mm-hmm.
Our Katie?

12:57.844 --> 12:59.477
Yeah, yeah, and that's
just the beginning

12:59.479 --> 13:01.045
of the revelations.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.384
(quietly):
I also found out

13:06.386 --> 13:09.554
that you never had the birds
and the bees talk with Katie

13:09.556 --> 13:12.090
like you told me you did.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.125
Uh-oh.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.929
Yeah. Yeah, you talk the talk,

13:17.931 --> 13:19.531
but you don't talk the talk.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.466
Okay.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.468
Okay... (stammers)
I meant to talk to her.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.270
I bought the book
and the dolls.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.838
And then when I went up to
her room, she was sitting there,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.574
playing with a stuffed unicorn.
I just couldn't do it.

13:29.576 --> 13:33.511
Teddy was playing with a yo-yo,
but I powered through.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.449
Okay, but, you know,
then I thought I would just wait

13:38.451 --> 13:41.252
for a natural time,
when she'd say something.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.554
And-and then, you know, I'd say,

13:42.556 --> 13:44.322
"Hey, it's funny
you should bring that up."

13:44.324 --> 13:45.924
But that never happened.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.125
And then,

13:47.127 --> 13:48.560
one day, I got a,

13:48.562 --> 13:50.094
you know, a permission slip

13:50.096 --> 13:51.596
for a special health class.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.598
So, you know, I just...

13:53.600 --> 13:56.501
let it ride.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.037
Let it ride.
Yeah.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.840
Did not know that was an option,
Mrs. Pants On Fire!

14:01.842 --> 14:03.975
Oh, come on!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.510
You are not mad because I lied--

14:05.512 --> 14:07.512
you're mad because I figured out
a way to get out of this

14:07.514 --> 14:09.214
and you couldn't.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.882
I outmaneuvered you.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.584
No! It's because...

14:12.586 --> 14:15.186
Yes, that's exactly it!

14:16.256 --> 14:18.423
Well, congratulations.

14:18.425 --> 14:21.559
You almost got away clean.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.027
Wh-What do you mean, "almost"?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.530
Turns out Katie
was looking at those pictures

14:25.532 --> 14:27.532
because she has some intimate,

14:27.534 --> 14:31.102
private lady questions
about her body.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.871
Hmm?

14:32.873 --> 14:38.543
Questions that only her mother
can answer.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.579
Fine, I will talk to her
tomorrow.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.580
Mm.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.615
(groans)

14:43.617 --> 14:46.451
This is gonna be
so awkward.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.387
Aw.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.955
I hope so.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.027
Katie...

14:58.064 --> 15:00.398
Katie, Katie,
Kate, Kate. (chuckles)

15:00.400 --> 15:02.233
What's up?
(clears throat)

15:02.235 --> 15:04.135
So...

15:04.137 --> 15:07.372
I'd like to tell you
the story of my breasts.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.375
KATE: Oh, my God!
Please stop talking!

15:10.377 --> 15:12.644
(door slams)

15:12.646 --> 15:15.413
Kate sounds mad at Mommy.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.981
Isn't it glorious?

15:20.353 --> 15:23.488
I finished my lunch, Daddy.
Can I go play?

15:23.490 --> 15:26.624
Yes, go play.
That's what the world needs.

15:26.626 --> 15:31.262
(sighs)
All right, I still got one.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.266
Well, uh, Kate and Teddy
are gonna pass on lunch.

15:35.268 --> 15:39.404
They said they don't think
they'll ever be hungry again.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.705
Well, it's official.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.341
We are really bad
at these talks.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.577
And yet so good
at the thing itself.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.380
Well, that's because
we don't talk during the thing.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.581
We tried once.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.416
You got bossy.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.117
You know, the problem is

15:53.119 --> 15:55.286
that n-now we've made
this subject so horribly awkward

15:55.288 --> 15:57.388
for our kids,
and we need to undo it.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.590
Otherwise, they're never
gonna talk to us about anything.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.226
You're saying we have
to have another terrible talk

16:02.228 --> 16:04.729
to ensure future terrible talks?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.898
Exactly.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.066
I thought if I said it out loud
it might change your mind.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.606
Emme's gonna stay
upstairs, right?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.543
Yeah, yeah. I gave her a bowl
of candy and shut her door.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.379
Ooh. We won't see her
for a while, but, when we do,

16:21.381 --> 16:23.348
she's gonna be riding
the dragon.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.186
Okay. Let's do this.
All right.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.991
BOTH:
Hey...

16:33.994 --> 16:35.693
Oh, no.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.695
Okay, guys, I...

16:37.697 --> 16:40.698
I think we kind of screwed
this whole thing up,

16:40.700 --> 16:42.166
all right? We
made what happens

16:42.168 --> 16:44.168
between a man and a woman...

16:44.170 --> 16:46.004
u-upsetting.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.574
Or a man and a man and
a woman and a woman.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.143
What?!

16:52.145 --> 16:54.712
Okay, don't worry, don't worry.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.081
We don't have the dolls
for that.

16:57.083 --> 17:01.519
The point is that we want
you guys to feel comfortable

17:01.521 --> 17:03.654
talking to us about any
questions you may have.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.792
Yeah. Exactly. We don't want
you to go to the Internet.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.127
We want you
to come to us.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.628
Because, really,

17:10.630 --> 17:14.065
all this is totally
natural and beautiful.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.433
ADAM:
Exactly.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.402
Like-like when your mom and I...

17:17.404 --> 17:18.436
Ugh!
Okay,

17:18.438 --> 17:20.071
okay, okay. Not us.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.640
Two-two other people,
like, uh...

17:22.642 --> 17:24.475
Patrick Dempsey.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.679
Patrick Dempsey?

17:28.681 --> 17:32.583
All right, fine. Then I'm going
with, uh, Jennifer Lawrence.

17:33.787 --> 17:36.187
She is half your age.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.824
Hey, when I imagine these
things, I'm half my age, too.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.760
What are you guys doing?
ANDI:
Okay, okay.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.295
H-Here's the point.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.763
(clears throat)

17:45.765 --> 17:47.765
When these things happen,

17:47.767 --> 17:51.436
two human beings connect
on a very intimate level.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.638
I-It's not about
the mechanics. It's...

17:53.640 --> 17:55.807
it's about the love. Now,

17:55.809 --> 17:58.810
here's how we should've
explained it in the first place.

17:58.812 --> 17:59.844
Just like we practiced.

17:59.846 --> 18:00.845
I got it.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.548
(clearing throat)

18:09.722 --> 18:12.557
Hello.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.292
I am a man.

18:14.294 --> 18:18.229
And I have loved you
for a very long time.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.730
And I am a woman.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.365
And you look
like a good project

18:21.367 --> 18:24.702
for me to improve.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.371
Very funny, Sandy.
(chuckles)

18:27.373 --> 18:30.374
Now that we've
finished college,

18:30.376 --> 18:32.543
let's take the next step.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.212
I am just

18:34.214 --> 18:36.114
so glad we didn't
meet in a bar.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.482
Hmm.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.750
Should we make a baby?

18:39.752 --> 18:42.286
Heck yeah!

18:43.556 --> 18:46.791
It's our biological
imperative.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.862
Hey, let's call our parents
and discuss our options.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.232
Or we could just
walk over there,

18:54.234 --> 18:55.867
because we love
them so much,

18:55.869 --> 18:59.137
we live right
down the street.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.807
The end.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.642
Of act one.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.847
ANDI:
<i> What are you reading?</i>

19:09.849 --> 19:12.483
The book that came
with the dolls.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.319
Surprisingly,

19:15.321 --> 19:18.422
there's a few things in here
I thought we could try.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.891
Really?

19:19.893 --> 19:21.726
Mm. Yeah.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.163
Might I direct your attention
to this illustration,

19:25.165 --> 19:30.168
and ask that you pretend
they are not cartoon bears.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.371
I-I think he's just
giving her a massage.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.540
Nah. No, no, no, no.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.276
Look at the smile
on her face.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.813
Something's going on
with that back paw.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.282
Mm-hmm.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.784
Hello.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.787
I am a man.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.725
And I have loved you
for a very long time.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.861
Well, hello.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.863
I am a woman.
Mm.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.733
And I think your project
does not need improving.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.235
Aw.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.970
Turn off the lights.

20:05.972 --> 20:09.473
So bossy.
Oh...

20:09.475 --> 20:10.942
(chuckles)

20:15.481 --> 20:18.583
So what did you bring for
show-and-tell today, Emme?
This.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.420
Ah.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.855
These are special dolls
that my mommy and daddy have.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.657
Mm.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.492
And what makes them so special?

20:28.494 --> 20:30.378
This does.

20:30.379 --> 20:32.263
Oh, dear Lord! Everybody,
heads on the desk, eyes closed!
