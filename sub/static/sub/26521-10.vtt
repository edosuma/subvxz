01:16.409 --> 01:17.827
I'm Zeus.

You guys were in a thunderstorm, right?

It's not really a storm.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.856
It was awesome!

04:34.190 --> 04:35.942
We went fishing out on the lake.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.194
We roasted marshmallows,
told scary stories,

marshmallows and scared ourselves.

and watching dots in the dark.

I busted out and hid for two weeks
inside a dead tree trunk filled with bees.

after you eat enough bees,

06:18.628 --> 06:19.921
they stop trying to sting you

06:20.004 --> 06:22.298
and just accept
that you're their new queen.

you were happier in a supporting role.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.897
But I'm good with blankies.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.438
-[tires screech]
-[all grunt]

10:06.147 --> 10:07.023
What is it?

10:10.359 --> 10:11.193
-Aw!
-[gasps]

10:11.652 --> 10:13.571
-[both panting]
-[Staci grunts]

10:15.823 --> 10:17.575
[car horns honking]

10:17.658 --> 10:18.743
Jimbo, wait!

10:19.327 --> 10:20.995
-[car horn honks]
-No!

10:22.330 --> 10:24.248
Why'd you stop me? I had them!

10:24.498 --> 10:26.584
You were about to run into traffic!

10:26.667 --> 10:28.669
I was following my heart.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.006
Then, buddy, your heart's trying
to turn you into a street pancake.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.507
I'm sorry, Staci.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.427
I... I just don't wanna lose
another blankie.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.804
Not like before.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.682
You're dying to tell me the story,
aren't you?

10:41.766 --> 10:44.852
I left my blankie for just a second,
and when I came back...

10:44.935 --> 10:46.187
[sniffling]

10:46.270 --> 10:48.856
I'm too close to this! [sobbing]

10:48.939 --> 10:51.400
We'll get that kid his blankie back, okay?

10:51.984 --> 10:55.571
You just can't follow every instinct
that hits your mushy parts.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.741
That's what got us into this mess
in the first place.

10:58.949 --> 11:01.994
[gasps] So you're saying
maybe that's what gets us out!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.829
That is not at all what I am saying.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.373
Show us the way, blankie.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.792
Let the wind blow us to your home.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.963
You didn't really expect that to--

11:13.923 --> 11:15.424
[both wailing]

11:15.758 --> 11:16.676
[both grunt]

11:17.343 --> 11:18.344
[giggles]

11:18.761 --> 11:21.305
Is... Is Lake Turtlemouth closed?

11:21.639 --> 11:22.973
How do you close a lake?

11:23.057 --> 11:25.059
It can't be closed. Try the gate.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.977
[grunting]

11:27.186 --> 11:28.229
It's not budging.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.647
Are we in the right place?

11:30.022 --> 11:32.191
I took the right turn at Widow's Gulch.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.651
Or was it a left?

11:36.987 --> 11:37.822
[snaps fingers]

11:38.989 --> 11:40.950
-What's the plan, Templeton?
-I don't know.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.910
Maybe Dad can find us
another place to camp.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.496
-It's all the same, right?
-All the same? [sighs]

11:45.871 --> 11:47.373
Templeton, Templeton.

11:47.706 --> 11:51.377
What's your favorite drive-thru hamburger
and French fried potato establishment?

11:51.585 --> 11:53.295
Fatso Phantom's Ghostburger To Go.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.380
Of course it is.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.924
And what would you say
if on your next visit

11:57.007 --> 12:00.845
to Mr. Phantom's "restaurant,"
instead of a juicy burger,

12:00.928 --> 12:04.056
they served you an asparagus-beet salad
with lemon vinaigrette?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.057
Ew!

12:05.141 --> 12:06.809
Ew, precisely.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.228
This is the Fatso Phantom Ghostburger.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.149
It's not the finest establishment in town,
but it's proven it works

12:13.232 --> 12:15.443
and it's what makes the customer happy.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.279
Anyplace else is just asparagus and beets.

12:18.362 --> 12:22.491
-We are not going asparagus-beet camping.
-Darn right we're not.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.202
That stupid fence is going down!

12:26.704 --> 12:29.123
[grunting]

12:29.206 --> 12:30.791
-What are you doing?
-Picking the lock.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.044
-You know how to pick locks?
-I saw it on TV, so I assumed I could.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.173
[sighs] Uppies.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.924
You know how to pick locks?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.093
[scoffs] Corporate espionage, Templeton.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.137
If you're not going through
your coworkers' desks,

12:43.220 --> 12:44.680
you're not corner office material.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.560
Hey, it's open!

12:49.643 --> 12:51.270
[Tim] Just needed a good push.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.481
-The baby helped.
-[cooing, giggling]

12:53.564 --> 12:55.357
Aw, I bet he did.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.776
Looks like Lake Turtlemouth is back on.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.653
I love Dudes' Weekend.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.991
Yay! Thanks, blankie!

13:04.074 --> 13:05.326
Thanks for what?

13:05.409 --> 13:08.370
We don't even know
if we're going in the right direction.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.873
If you follow your heart,
you can't go wrong.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.334
[sirens wailing]

13:14.418 --> 13:16.420
Ooh, police cars!

13:16.504 --> 13:17.755
-[thumps]
-[both grunt]

13:23.177 --> 13:24.637
Triple crud!

13:25.179 --> 13:27.181
[birds chirping]

13:28.516 --> 13:29.767
Dudes' Weekend.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.310
Dudes' Weekend.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.942
This has to be mankind's least
efficient method of acquiring seafood.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.194
But if it's what the customer wants...

13:40.528 --> 13:41.362
Hey!

13:43.072 --> 13:43.906
[laughs]

13:44.073 --> 13:46.534
Hey, Dad, I think the baby
wants to fish, too.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.245
[laughs] That is the cutest thing!

13:49.620 --> 13:50.538
Where's my camera?

13:51.705 --> 13:54.208
-[reel clicking]
-Ooh, I think you're getting a nibble.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.545
Fart poop doody, it's alive!

13:57.795 --> 14:00.589
-Say chee-- uh... uh...
-[splashes]

14:02.174 --> 14:03.300
Oh. Oh, dear.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.888
Dudes' Weekend!

14:08.222 --> 14:10.349
-[siren wails]
-Ten-sixty-four. Ten-sixty-four.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.475
Crime in progress.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.311
Campground trespassing.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.439
[man]  Doug, you know we're chasing
an actual bank robber back in town.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.150
Darn it to heck! I just said I'm busy!

14:20.651 --> 14:22.570
[sirens wailing]

14:22.778 --> 14:24.697
[evil laugh]

14:24.780 --> 14:27.032
Eat tailpipe, Smokey!

14:27.116 --> 14:29.118
I got a tank full of gas

14:29.201 --> 14:33.455
and enough stolen cash
to put my baby through Ohio State...

14:34.123 --> 14:36.292
for one full semester!

14:37.084 --> 14:39.545
We're riding getaway
with a bank robber, Jimbo.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.006
The cops are gonna capture her,
and then they're gonna find us

14:42.089 --> 14:44.758
and guess who's back in daycare, huh?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.760
[hyperventilating]

14:46.844 --> 14:49.054
What are we gonna do,  boss?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.098
I don't know. I just follow my heart.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.766
And my heart says...

14:52.850 --> 14:54.560
[gasps] Ooh! Garden hose!

14:55.728 --> 14:58.355
[Jimbo in spooky voice] Bank robber!

14:59.481 --> 15:02.902
What the--?
All right, who's in my bank robbing truck?

15:03.235 --> 15:07.072
I'm the spirit of your childhood blankie.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.158
I need you to go to...

15:09.366 --> 15:12.411
529 Conklin Avenue.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.622
Or else!

15:14.872 --> 15:18.792
Cool, I won't have to go to daycare
because we'll be dead.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.628
Trust the process.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.297
[mocking] Oh. Terrifying.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.926
But guess what.
I never had a blankie when I was a kid.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.763
What do you think set me on the path
of thievery and moral turpitude?

15:30.846 --> 15:32.306
[grunting] Get-- I will--

15:32.431 --> 15:35.893
[gasps] She's got no conscience.
My heart lied to me!

15:35.976 --> 15:38.479
I swear to-- Who's really back there?

15:39.271 --> 15:40.898
[Staci] Tiny ghosts, sucker!

15:40.981 --> 15:43.567
-[shouting]
-[tires squealing, crashes]

15:44.234 --> 15:46.779
Well, scratch the fish portion
of the perfect weekend.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.573
Gotta come back strong
with these marshmallow brûlée-kabobs.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.491
How are they coming?

15:50.574 --> 15:52.534
[grunting]

15:53.327 --> 15:55.329
You know how to make a fire with sticks?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.456
I saw it on TV, so I assumed I could.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.750
[grunting] Oh!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.085
What about matches?

16:01.210 --> 16:04.755
Ha! You think I'd bring matches
where a baby could get them?

16:04.964 --> 16:05.798
[gasps]

16:06.173 --> 16:08.884
Sorry, boys. No toasted marshmallows.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.552
I better go pitch the tent.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.598
-What?
-I'm the beet-asparagus salad.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.516
What?

16:15.599 --> 16:18.310
What's different
about this Dudes' Weekend? Me!

16:18.394 --> 16:22.314
It's all going sideways
because of the baby, and I'm the baby!

16:22.564 --> 16:23.732
We have to turn this around.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.734
Can you eat marshmallows without toasting?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.903
-Oh!
-Not when you're camping.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.071
That's a sin!

16:29.279 --> 16:30.948
The happy photograph, Templeton!

16:31.031 --> 16:33.742
We're losing it all.
Fix it, fix it, save me!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.203
We haven't lost all of it.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.872
We just have to get Dad
and me and you there,

16:39.123 --> 16:40.833
the perfect viewpoint.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.043
For the perfect photo!

16:43.127 --> 16:45.462
Time to save Dudes' Weekend.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.673
-[car horn honking]
-[woman groaning]

16:47.756 --> 16:48.924
[both groaning]

16:49.008 --> 16:51.301
Blankie, I'm so sorry.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.220
I just wanted to get you home.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.680
I tried to follow my heart,

16:54.763 --> 16:57.766
but everything just took you
farther and farther away.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.684
[sniffles]

16:58.767 --> 17:00.978
I should never have been in charge.

17:02.896 --> 17:03.731
Huh!

17:04.273 --> 17:06.108
529 Conklin Avenue.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.485
[gasps] Blankie, you're home!

17:08.861 --> 17:11.572
But, Staci, how did you know
the exact right moment

17:11.655 --> 17:13.699
to make that bank robber crash her truck?

17:13.866 --> 17:14.992
I didn't.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.827
Everything was going doody-side up,

17:16.910 --> 17:19.913
so I just grabbed the blanket
and followed  my  heart.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.333
My twisted black heart. [chuckles]

17:23.417 --> 17:25.919
You did a Jimbo, and it worked!

17:26.170 --> 17:27.546
Learn from the best.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.673
Lead the way, Boss.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.385
[sirens wailing]

17:33.469 --> 17:35.095
[tires screeching]

17:35.596 --> 17:37.264
Freeze! Step out of your car.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.683
[groaning, murmuring]

17:41.060 --> 17:44.730
Are those babies
climbing up the side of that house?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.232
[man over radio]  Debbie, bank robber.
Focus up.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.194
[Dad whistling tune]

17:50.277 --> 17:51.236
Nah, that's not it.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.447
[whistling tune]

17:53.530 --> 17:55.074
[sighs] I used to know this.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.575
It's a classic hiking song.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.704
Ooh, maybe the bass part.
[imitating funky bass]

18:00.788 --> 18:02.706
[sighs] Never mind.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.583
Where is that perfect viewpoint?

18:06.877 --> 18:08.629
Is that the trail? No.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.130
Uh, that one!

18:10.422 --> 18:11.465
No, that's a raccoon.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.802
-Dad, do you know where we're going?
-Of course!

18:15.594 --> 18:16.428
No.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.222
[sighs] Boys, it's getting late.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.516
We-- We may have to call this off.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.767
No way, Dad!

18:21.850 --> 18:25.104
This is Dudes' Weekend,
and dudes never give up,

18:25.187 --> 18:27.773
because we're having
too much fun to quit, right?

18:27.856 --> 18:29.274
-[Doug] Wrong!
-[Templetons] Ah!

18:29.608 --> 18:30.567
Dudes.

18:31.068 --> 18:31.902
[baby fussing]

18:31.985 --> 18:35.322
[woman] Did we leave Jamie's B-L-A-N-K-I-E
at your place yesterday?

18:35.989 --> 18:38.575
No, not "bonkley!" His blankie!

18:39.284 --> 18:40.744
[wailing]

18:40.828 --> 18:43.664
Shush, shush, shush. It's cool, kid. Shh.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.624
Jimbo, it's your rodeo.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.751
[excited cooing]

18:48.043 --> 18:49.211
Hold it close.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.965
You've got to love your blankie
as much as your blankie loves you.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.633
[woman] Hang on. He just quieted down.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.717
Oh, let me check on him.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.178
You found it!

18:58.262 --> 19:00.848
Oh, sweetie, I told you it would turn up.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.687
And that's the story
of how Jimbo was in charge,

19:06.770 --> 19:11.275
and everyone followed their heart,
and it all worked out in the end.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.026
Those are babies up there!

19:14.069 --> 19:15.571
Infinity crud.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.032
Oh, oh, so your climbing babies
can be real,

19:19.116 --> 19:22.411
but my tiny ghost
is just crazy bank robber talk?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.413
You're such a Debbie.

19:24.830 --> 19:29.543
What kind of dad brings his own kids
on a misdemeanor trespass?

19:29.626 --> 19:32.296
[scoffs] What kind of outing is that
for a family?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.673
We're not a family, we're dudes!

19:34.756 --> 19:35.883
Tim, shush.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.009
Officer, I'm sorry.

19:37.384 --> 19:41.013
If you'll let my wife come get the kids,
I'm prepared to go quietly.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.682
Wait, so otherwise,
you were gonna fight me right now?

19:44.016 --> 19:44.892
No, sir!

19:46.810 --> 19:49.855
I'm not letting Johnny Law
interfere with a good business plan.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.232
-We're not done here.
-What are you gonna do?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.402
On the field team,
we call it "doing a Jimbo."

19:56.612 --> 19:58.655

[Tim] Hey!

20:05.662 --> 20:07.623
Pssh. Great parenting.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.583
Wonder where they get  that  from.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.834
Tim, what--?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.961
Answer: Not the mom.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.338
Extra credit: It's the dad.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.675
I can't go to jail. I'm too innocent!

Boys, you gotta stop.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.067
And not just because...
because I'm in terrible shape.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.610
But, Dad, we can't just--

20:36.693 --> 20:37.653
I don't believe it.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.738
Tim, this is it!

20:39.988 --> 20:41.114

Whoa, you're right!

He got his revenge.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.605
Sorry everything went wrong, Dad.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.233
We just wanted to have a fun weekend
with you.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.278
You know, so you'd be happy.

Um, Mr. Templeton, you are, thankfully,
not my problem anymore.

-Uh, h-h-hi, hon--
-Nope.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.940
What do we do about them?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.403
Code Bink-Bink too much to handle,
Jimbo?

22:02.446 --> 22:05.157
Actually, sir, the blankie was returned,
no problem.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.658
Jimbo did great.

22:06.742 --> 22:10.245
Getting arrested was all part of the plan.
Right, buddy?

22:10.454 --> 22:11.455
[nervous laugh] Mm-hmm!

22:11.538 --> 22:12.706
Glad to hear it.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.958
Guess you won't need me
to pick the lock then.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.752
Boss, don't leave us here.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.629
Brain, not heart, on this one, Jimbo.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.007
You're babies. Just slip between the bars.

22:24.885 --> 22:25.761
Oh, yeah.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.099
Looks good to me.
