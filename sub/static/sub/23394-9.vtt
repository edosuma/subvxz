WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.826
Now, there are some of us

00:02.961 --> 00:04.293
who don't even believe
he's human.

00:04.421 --> 00:07.789
- We think he might be a spirit.
- He's most assuredly human.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.801
There was a massacre
in New Paltz.

00:11.929 --> 00:15.422
It's possible it was committed
by a man named Beecham...

00:15.557 --> 00:17.344
John Beecham.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.933
Do you think
it was an accident?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.552
His throat was cut
from ear to ear.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.768
Tell us about your brother.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.854
I came across him sitting
astride a dead striker.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.524
A young man.
A boy, really.

00:30.656 --> 00:34.650
He was stabbing at the body
with a knife, over and over.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.242
Dr. Kreizler!

00:37.496 --> 00:39.579
Run!

00:40.666 --> 00:42.157
- Uhh!
- Aah!

01:14.866 --> 01:17.904
"...And if thou wilt, remember,

01:18.036 --> 01:21.950
and if thou wilt, forget,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.200
I shall not see the shadows,

01:25.335 --> 01:28.749
I shall not feel the rain,

01:28.880 --> 01:32.373
I shall not hear
the nightingale sing on,

01:32.509 --> 01:34.876
as if in pain.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.550
And dreaming
through the twilight,

01:37.681 --> 01:40.424
that doth not rise nor set,

01:40.559 --> 01:43.802
haply I may remember,

01:43.937 --> 01:47.476
and haply may forget."

01:56.074 --> 01:58.407
I'm so very sorry.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.208
My deepest condolences.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.835
Thank you.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.088
Please forgive me

02:20.223 --> 02:24.342
for offering you the same advice
you once gave me.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.687
You are not alone
in your sorrow,

02:27.814 --> 02:31.398
and there's no shame in grieving
for those you love.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.601
Laszlo.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.194
It's over.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.074
This wretched investigation
is over.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.497
Laszlo, give yourself
a few days before you...

03:31.628 --> 03:34.712
Before I what?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.126
Before I get you killed, too?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.674
You weren't responsible
for her death.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.967
Who, then, if not me?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.818
So there we were,

04:46.953 --> 04:49.991
waitin' outside the house
for the doctor to return.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.413
And the Indian lass,
she invited us in.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.087
"Would you like a lovely cup
of tea?" she said.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.127
She invited you in
for a cup of tea?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.841
I could tell
that she was interested

05:02.969 --> 05:04.176
in more than a cup of tea.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.674
So I made myself scarce.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.180
Mary couldn't speak.

05:14.064 --> 05:18.980
I wasn't being literal,
Detective Sergeant.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.395
She said it with her eyes.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.988
Know what I mean?

05:24.115 --> 05:26.232
You saw her lead Connor
up to the bedroom?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.451
By the nose.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.944
So when'd she fetch the knife?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.285
Well...

05:33.416 --> 05:36.375
I suppose she had it hidden,

05:36.503 --> 05:40.338
up her petticoat the whole time.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.831
You expect us to believe you?

05:41.967 --> 05:43.833
I expect you to believe me

05:43.969 --> 05:47.462
over Sambo
and some half-wit stable boy.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.557
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Marcus.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.800
- Marcus.
- Look at youse.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.802
A couple of heebs
playin' at cops.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.906
All right, wait,

06:07.033 --> 06:09.650
here's one for
the literary scholars among you.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.743
Who is the greatest
killer of chickens

06:11.872 --> 06:14.956
in all of Shakespeare's plays?

06:15.083 --> 06:18.121
That would
be Macbeth because

06:18.253 --> 06:20.791
he committed murder
most "fowl."

06:25.135 --> 06:26.626
Hello, Commissioner.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.490
You look like
you're on your way to church.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.927
Here.
Why don't you take a pew?

06:37.063 --> 06:39.055
I've been to a funeral.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.516
Have you, now?

06:43.069 --> 06:46.028
One could say you bear
some of the responsibility.

06:46.156 --> 06:50.526
You and the police force you
built over the last 30 years.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.743
You know, you got rioting
in the Points.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.911
You got a multimurderer
on the loose,

06:58.043 --> 07:00.251
and you come walking in here,
accusing me of crimes

07:00.378 --> 07:03.621
brought on by your own
lack of leadership.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.675
And where would I find good men
in the department to lead?

07:12.182 --> 07:17.143
Men, good or bad, do not follow
what they don't respect.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.434
And what is it that
you teach them to respect?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.733
I taught them to respect
a badge...

07:30.158 --> 07:32.241
...and a uniform...

07:34.079 --> 07:35.945
...and all they stand for.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.824
What they do not respect
is weakness.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.922
Now, don't you have
more pressing issues

07:51.054 --> 07:53.842
other than making false
allegations against an old man

07:53.974 --> 07:57.263
who's just trying to enjoy
the fruits of his retirement?

07:57.394 --> 08:01.559
Weakness is hiding
in the past, old man.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.071
I'm afraid it's no use.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.322
I've spoken to Laszlo,

08:19.457 --> 08:24.327
and he won't... or can't...
change his mind.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.624
Then we'll have to continue
without him.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.083
I know how much
of an opportunity this is.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.304
I know how much it
could help convince...

08:35.432 --> 08:36.548
Please don't insult me.

08:39.144 --> 08:43.558
Do you honestly believe I'm
doing this to advance myself?

08:43.690 --> 08:47.525
I'm doing this because I want
to sleep soundly again.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.939
What happens when
the next boy is killed?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.983
I'm not talking about
what happens.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.072
I'm talking about
what's possible.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.487
And is it possible for you
to walk away from this?

08:58.913 --> 09:01.951
Because I can't.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.578
Dr. Kreizler's withdrawn
because he's been hurt,

09:06.713 --> 09:09.922
as badly as anyone can be.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.791
But we have a duty to go on.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.088
But we don't have the knowledge
or the know-how.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.587
We have a name.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.340
We have a suspect.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.934
I believe Japheth Dury
killed his parents

09:22.062 --> 09:23.894
and a man named George Beecham.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.854
He took his name,
or part of it,

09:25.982 --> 09:28.395
and became John Beecham.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.896
All we have to do is find him.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.165
What is this place?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.374
It used to be a saloon

09:46.503 --> 09:48.343
before the commissioner's
Sunday licensing laws

09:48.379 --> 09:49.379
put it out of business.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.262
Welcome to our new headquarters.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.441
I followed him to his place.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.203
Connor.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.037
He lives in Brooklyn.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.601
They're the only family
in the house.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.958
Even got a yard
and an outhouse.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.699
It ain't fair
he's living like that

10:32.757 --> 10:34.373
and Mary's in the ground.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.464
It's a pity
she didn't finish him off,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.963
because if I got the chance,
I would

10:41.099 --> 10:42.260
stick a shank in his throat.

10:42.392 --> 10:46.181
You ain't got to cut
a man's throat to kill him.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.803
All you got to do is...

10:49.357 --> 10:51.189
...cut a man on his leg,

10:51.317 --> 10:54.276
nick a vein, you put him away
right quick.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.571
None of the murders have
taken place above 14th Street.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.163
Then we should
narrow our inquiries

11:06.291 --> 11:08.051
to Greenwich Village
and the Lower East Side.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.410
That's only half the population
of the city.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.481
He... He knows his way
around the rooftops.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.997
Perhaps his profession
is somehow connected.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.613
Churches and charities use the
rooftops to get around the city.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.594
Then why don't
we knock on some doors and...

11:21.723 --> 11:22.839
We don't have time.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.387
We need to narrow down
our possibilities quickly.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.478
The Feast of St. Barnabas
is only eight days away,

11:27.562 --> 11:29.849
and we know
he won't stop killing.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.563
We have until the 11th.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.149
Then perhaps we should
involve the police.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.939
We are the police.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.603
Why did Japheth Dury change
his name to John Beecham

12:14.734 --> 12:17.943
when the man who violated him
was named George Beecham?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.778
Why take only his surname?

12:21.032 --> 12:22.694
There could be
some twisted logic to it.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.404
By taking his name
or part of it,

12:25.536 --> 12:27.323
he changes from victim
to tormentor.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.788
And by doing so,
assumes the identity

12:29.916 --> 12:31.248
of the man who betrayed him

12:31.376 --> 12:33.459
and in turn betrays boys
who trust him.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.921
Yes, but why John
and not George?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.961
We know that John Beecham
was released

12:40.093 --> 12:43.382
from St. Elizabeth's Hospital
in the summer of 1890,

12:43.513 --> 12:46.472
and the murders of the Zweig
twins occurred in 1893.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.807
If it was the same man,

12:48.935 --> 12:51.803
where was he
those intervening years?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.351
If I had your name and wanted
to know where you lived,

12:54.482 --> 12:56.314
where would I go,
Detective Sergeant Isaacson?

12:56.442 --> 12:57.478
Police records.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.943
Let's say you don't have
a police record.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.028
Official hours are over.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.867
We're with
the police department.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.515
Uh, we were wondering
if we could have a word

13:09.539 --> 13:10.700
with Mr. Charles Murray.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.245
And what is the purpose
of your inquiry?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.812
We'd like to check
the census records

13:14.836 --> 13:17.249
for the name of a man
we're trying to find.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.006
Stop!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.501
The Lower East Side wards.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.903
John Beecham.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.778
146 Allan Street.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.662
Aged two years.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.121
That would make him eight now.

14:14.187 --> 14:18.101
Nine, eight,

14:18.232 --> 14:20.849
seven, six,

14:20.985 --> 14:25.320
five, four,

14:25.448 --> 14:28.941
three, two,

14:29.077 --> 14:30.739
one!

15:02.777 --> 15:05.064
Perhaps he did
change his name.

15:05.196 --> 15:09.736
Or moved to New York
after the census.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.786
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.085
I smell the blood
of an Englishman.

15:22.213 --> 15:25.672
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.417
I smell the blood
of an Englishman.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.485
What is it?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.403
Look at this.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.649
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.868
I smell the blood
of an Englishman.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.948
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.996
I smell the blood
of an Englishman.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.002
Look at the bottom
of the page.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.133
He's here.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.635
He's real.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.357
Hey!
You kids can't be here!

16:43.711 --> 16:46.249
I don't see what business
it is of the commissioner

16:46.380 --> 16:48.838
to inquire
into our employment practices.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.425
We'd be happy to explain that
to Mr. Murray.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.465
I am Mr. Murray.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.557
Mr. Beecham's brother
may be involved

16:58.684 --> 17:00.266
in a land speculation scandal.

17:00.394 --> 17:04.137
The commissioner thought
that John might be able

17:04.272 --> 17:05.935
to help us locate him.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.775
Mm, I hired Beecham
as an enumerator...

17:08.903 --> 17:10.714
the men who did the counting
and the interviewing

17:10.738 --> 17:12.900
for the census...
in the spring of '90.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.694
I hired 900 such men.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.362
900,
and you still remember him?

17:17.494 --> 17:19.487
I remember all the men
who work for me.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.830
And he was particularly hard
to forget.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.703
He had a rather
unfortunate appearance.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.703
I was concerned that
people would be unwilling

17:28.839 --> 17:30.171
to allow him into their homes.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.006
You mean he had
a disfigurement?

17:32.134 --> 17:34.376
A facial spasm of some kind.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.969
I'm not a doctor.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.635
- But you hired him anyway?
- He was a decent fellow.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.429
Polite. Religious.
Scrupulous.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.471
Personally, I never gave much
credence to the allegations.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.188
What allegations?

17:47.316 --> 17:48.648
I had to fire him

17:48.776 --> 17:51.439
after a complaint
from a Jewish family.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.279
They claimed he had been
visiting their daughter

17:54.407 --> 17:55.523
on several occasions

17:55.658 --> 17:57.820
when he wasn't scheduled
for an interview.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.740
- How old was their daughter?
- 12 at the time.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.237
But I'm sure
you appreciate it

18:02.373 --> 18:05.537
that girls of that age
have vivid imaginations.

18:07.211 --> 18:11.171
And people of the Hebrew faith
even more so.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.583
You haven't, by any chance,
kept his employment records?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.425
We're the census department.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.014
We keep everything.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.952
They seem similar.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.623
And this over here,
near the top of the page?

18:50.755 --> 18:53.122
That's his address, of course.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.473
Whoa.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.266
This is the address
that he gave.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.934
23 Bank Street.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.565
I'd feel much safer

20:43.701 --> 20:46.239
if there were
a couple of roundsmen present.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.953
Not after
they shot you in the back.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.086
Hello?

22:21.590 --> 22:24.253
I'm sorry, dear.
I frightened ya.

22:24.385 --> 22:27.878
We apologize.
The door was unlocked.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.506
Oh! Silly me. Are you inquiring
about the room?

22:32.142 --> 22:33.804
Yes.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.472
Our friends
are looking for lodgings.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.765
They've gone upstairs.

22:38.274 --> 22:42.735
I'm afraid I only have the one
room available right now.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.446
- Have you any other lodgers?
- Just the kitties. For now.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.941
An acquaintance of mine,
John Beecham,

22:49.076 --> 22:50.533
gave me your address, ma'am.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.199
Ah, dear Mr. Beecham.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.447
Not a friend of the kitties.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.825
Yet he spoke so highly of you.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.792
I believe he was with you
for some time?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.786
Almost six years.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.211
He left last Christmas, after
he lost his job, poor man.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.753
I remember.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.754
It was the same day
that Jib ran away.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.051
- Jib?
- My tabby.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.304
He never told me
he lost his job.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.098
Was that at the Census Bureau?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.687
Oh, no.
He was a charity worker.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.228
What kind of an employer

23:22.359 --> 23:24.897
dismisses a charity worker
at Christmas?

23:25.029 --> 23:27.021
And is it his room
you're letting out?

23:27.156 --> 23:30.069
I haven't had any lodgers
since he left.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.034
It's a cozy little room.

23:33.162 --> 23:36.701
Take a look for yourself.
Just along the corridor.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.294
Ohh.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.876
Something died.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.344
Evening, Miss Howard.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.014
- What do you want?
- Ah, nothing much.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.182
Now that I'm no longer
gainfully employed,

24:42.314 --> 24:46.558
sure,
the world's my oyster.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.401
May I walk you home?

24:48.529 --> 24:50.316
You may not.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.727
If you idle here
a moment longer,

24:51.782 --> 24:53.648
I shall alert one of
your former colleagues.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.195
Oh.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.822
Well, good luck finding one
at this time of night.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.085
Still trying to be a detective,
are you, Miss Howard?

25:10.634 --> 25:13.342
Get out of my way.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.132
You don't want me
to see you home?

25:15.264 --> 25:16.926
Well, you best be careful
is all.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.925
All it takes is for someone
to come up behind you,

25:20.060 --> 25:22.420
clasp a hand around your mouth,
and force you to your knees,

25:22.479 --> 25:25.597
and you'll never know
who it was put it inside you.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.302
Whoo!

26:07.357 --> 26:08.357
No.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.434
Don't worry, girls.
He's with me.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.696
Keep an eye out, Maxie.
We won't be long.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.910
What are you doing
out on the street?

26:25.042 --> 26:26.749
The cops threw us out.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.869
Where else we got to go?

26:29.004 --> 26:32.088
You find a room
in a rescue society.

26:32.216 --> 26:35.334
And if they don't take you,
you go to a boardinghouse.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.506
Here.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.682
There's enough money there.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.018
If you need any more,
you just ask.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.728
I don't want you working
or living on the street.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.188
Understand?

26:54.404 --> 26:55.404
You sure what you told me

26:55.531 --> 26:57.864
about the man you're looking for
is right?

26:57.991 --> 26:59.448
Yes.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.119
It's just a friend of mine
met someone

27:03.247 --> 27:07.491
who promised to take him away
to live with him.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.162
What of his face?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.786
He didn't say there was
anything wrong with his face.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.754
I asked.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.481
What if I were the killer?

27:32.609 --> 27:35.067
Yeah, no offense,
Mr. Moore,

27:35.195 --> 27:37.482
but there's more chance
of pigs flying.

27:40.993 --> 27:44.327
Well, I ask because
the man we're looking for

27:44.454 --> 27:46.992
may not be a client.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.615
He might have a job
that allows him

27:48.750 --> 27:52.118
to get close to you boys
and win your trust.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.086
A charity worker,
for example.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.001
Yeah, I wouldn't trust
those sons of bitches

27:56.133 --> 27:57.499
as far as I could kick 'em.

27:57.634 --> 28:01.628
They just pretend to care
so they can cop a feel.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.131
A preacher then,
or... or a medical worker?

28:05.267 --> 28:09.762
Did Fatima ever mention to you
what his saint did for a living?

28:12.649 --> 28:15.517
Can you think of any reason
why he would've trusted him?

28:15.652 --> 28:18.645
All he said was the man was
nothing like his father,

28:18.780 --> 28:22.899
that he hated his father
more than anything in the world.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.726
How am I supposed
to keep goin' with that din?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.818
It's all that whisky
you been drinkin'.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.438
Don't you blame my Nievie.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.235
Gosh damn you, woman.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.108
And your Nievie!

29:33.188 --> 29:34.679
Cyrus?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.392
Cyrus?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.403
You called, sir?

29:42.531 --> 29:45.194
For Cyrus.
Where is he?

30:48.055 --> 30:49.341
Jesus Christ!

30:49.473 --> 30:51.556
Scared me.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.471
- What are you doin' out here?
- Same as you.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.892
Oh, yeah? Go on, then,
if you can find the wee thing.

31:00.067 --> 31:02.150
Fat bastard.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.292
<i>Broyt</i> is "bread" in English.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.214
Lena, repeat after me,

32:10.345 --> 32:12.837
"The bread is stale."

32:12.973 --> 32:15.932
<i>Ze bruht ist stehl.</i>

32:18.854 --> 32:21.062
"The." "The."

32:22.315 --> 32:25.899
Yes, I remember him.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.861
Your parents filed a complaint.
May I ask what you told them?

32:28.989 --> 32:31.151
Only that he was my friend.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.195
What exactly do you mean
by "friend"?

32:33.326 --> 32:35.443
I mean friend.

32:35.579 --> 32:39.038
I teach English.
I know what the word means.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.704
I'm sorry we have to ask,
but did he lay hands on you?

32:42.836 --> 32:43.836
Not once.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.495
I made that clear
to my parents,

32:45.630 --> 32:47.622
but they filed the complaint
about him anyway.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.716
When you were together,
what did you talk about?

32:52.637 --> 32:55.425
How much I hated my parents.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.265
And all these years later,
why do you think

32:58.393 --> 33:01.477
a grown man would befriend
a 12-year-old girl?

33:02.647 --> 33:05.230
I think he wanted
someone to talk to.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.482
I don't think he had
many friends.

33:26.713 --> 33:27.749
Hello.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.294
My name is Detective Sergeant
Lucius Isaacson.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.100
George Beecham.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.558
- Do you recognize his face?
- No.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.950
Hey, boys.
Boys.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.323
Have you seen this man?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.245
- No.
- No, I haven't.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.202
The Feast of St. Barnabas.

35:24.331 --> 35:27.244
Do you think
it has meaning for him?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.287
Everything has meaning
for him.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.212
Whatever he does,

35:33.340 --> 35:35.172
it allows him
to befriend these boys.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.962
The teacher we questioned,
Ellie Leshka,

35:37.093 --> 35:39.176
used the word "friend"
about him several times.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.921
And we should keep talking
to charity organizations

35:42.057 --> 35:43.468
and church volunteers.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.861
Boys like these must have
nothing but contempt

35:47.979 --> 35:49.345
for charity workers.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.848
As a census officer,
Beecham would most probably have

35:51.983 --> 35:53.144
dealt with their parents.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.479
He hated his father more than
anything in the world.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.655
That's what Joseph said
about Ali ibn-Ghazi.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.951
He hated his father more
than anything in the world.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.495
And Ellie Leshka
said something similar, no?

36:10.627 --> 36:12.835
"How much I hate my parents."

36:12.962 --> 36:16.330
And Giorgio Santorelli
was beaten.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.925
Think of it.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.299
It's like
he can read their minds.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.763
He knows all about them...

36:24.891 --> 36:28.976
their wretched childhoods,
the beatings, the poverty.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.142
Everything he says
chimes with them.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.559
He understands them.
That's why they trust him.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.946
What else do we know
about Ali's father

36:41.074 --> 36:43.316
other than the fact
that his son hated him?

36:50.583 --> 36:53.621
Joseph told me Fatima's father
was a gambler.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.710
Giorgio's brother
said the same thing.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.128
Mr. Santorelli owed money.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.013
Mr. ibn-Ghazi
was in debt to you?

37:14.149 --> 37:16.015
He was in debt to the people
I work for.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.609
I collect for everybody
in the neighborhood.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.688
- Or my guys do.
- Your guys?

37:21.823 --> 37:25.237
I'm a little too old to be
knocking down doors myself.

37:25.368 --> 37:29.829
Ibn whatever-his-name
was a testy son of a bitch.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.243
The first man I sent 'round
came back with a broken nose,

37:32.375 --> 37:33.615
so I had to send
a bigger fella.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.521
- Do you have his name?
- The people who work for me

37:35.545 --> 37:37.582
don't volunteer their names,
so I don't ask.

37:37.714 --> 37:38.714
Maybe you should start.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.334
You know,
you don't look like a cop.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.550
Yes, I've heard that.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.545
John something-or-other.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.637
Had something wrong with his...

37:49.017 --> 37:50.133
Do you know where he lives?

37:50.268 --> 37:52.225
That I don't know,

37:52.353 --> 37:54.891
but I can tell you
where he's likely to be.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.106
Lucius,
you and Miss Howard stay here,

37:57.233 --> 37:59.395
keep watch.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.478
Don't want the drinks?

38:34.521 --> 38:36.057
Information.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.189
About a customer.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.689
Get out.

38:46.616 --> 38:47.616
John Beecham.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.113
Tall fella.
Facial tic.

38:59.629 --> 39:00.629
End of the street.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.543
Three-story house,
second floor.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.632
You heard nothin' from me.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.300
That's no man to cross.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.527
Jump in the water and scram!

40:06.654 --> 40:08.862
We're about to close.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.202
You coming in?

40:15.330 --> 40:19.074
You go ahead.
I'm gonna get changed.

41:25.858 --> 41:29.272
Time to go home, boys!
This way!

41:31.864 --> 41:34.322
Is he looking?

41:34.450 --> 41:36.817
No.
Why?

41:36.953 --> 41:39.946
I'm meeting someone.
I'll s-see you later.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.259
Giorgio.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.548
Ali.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.599
Ernst Lohmann.

42:06.274 --> 42:08.015
Today.

42:08.151 --> 42:10.859
We may be too late.

42:16.409 --> 42:19.152
Beers and smokes are on me,
boys.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.415
Maxie, you son of a bitch!

42:38.514 --> 42:41.803
What was the line in the letter
about Giorgio?

42:41.934 --> 42:44.972
"It fed me for a week."

43:51.671 --> 43:53.207
Is that you?

44:07.061 --> 44:09.804
His father's pictures.

44:57.612 --> 44:58.898
John.

45:03.242 --> 45:05.154
What is it?

45:05.286 --> 45:07.278
It's a heart.

45:30.811 --> 45:33.144
How many have there been?
