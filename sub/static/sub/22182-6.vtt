WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:03.637
You're the first Special
Ops chick I ever met.

00:03.671 --> 00:06.607
How do you control yourself
around so many hot, sweaty men?

00:06.640 --> 00:09.077
The only hard part's
the smell, sir.
(laughs)

00:09.110 --> 00:11.011
Go, go, go, go, go!
They have the package.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.515
(screams)

00:17.751 --> 00:19.820
I'm an American citizen.
Don't let him do this.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.056
Move, or I will shoot
through you.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.325
They told us we were targeting
a Somali national that night.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.626
Instead we get
an American soldier.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.694
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured,

00:26.727 --> 00:27.828
along with Sergeant Hendrix.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.530
We are assembling a team to plan

00:29.563 --> 00:31.199
and execute a rescue mission.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.600
Hudson said Max has been talking
about his dad a lot.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.469
He's M.I.A.?
Yeah, that's right.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.305
Got Hendrix and Kam's location.
Let's get in the air.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.739
If our guys ever find
this place,

00:38.772 --> 00:40.341
they'll find this message.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.675
There should have been
a door right here.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.676
All I saw was a cabinet.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.312
Clear. They're not here.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.147
I got a hostile!
Darzi, run!

00:46.180 --> 00:48.816
People could die if I'm not
on top of my game.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.484
These pills are what
get me there.
No, Nora...

00:50.518 --> 00:52.486
Please.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.288
Don't come back to me.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.090
I can't feel my toes.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.791
Hey, Darzi,
take these.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.060
What are you doing?
He's in pain,
and those will help.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.241
Where do you think
they're taking us now?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.609
I don't know.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.448
But they should have used

01:20.481 --> 01:21.649
more than one guard.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.518
Now.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.156
(grunting)

01:49.843 --> 01:51.145
Let's go.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.151
(both shouting)

01:59.387 --> 02:01.889
(pained groaning)

02:07.261 --> 02:08.562
Keys.
The keys.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.465
(groaning, coughing)

02:12.966 --> 02:14.335
You okay?

02:14.368 --> 02:15.836
Go, go.
No, no.

02:15.869 --> 02:16.837
Come on, get up.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.906
Go!

02:19.907 --> 02:21.675
Come on, Crank, let's go.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.545
(pained groan)

02:24.578 --> 02:26.247
Go!
Get up.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.849
Get up now!

02:28.882 --> 02:30.784
*

02:40.428 --> 02:41.762
Morning.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.265
(cadets chanting outside)

02:44.298 --> 02:47.268
Still thinking
about the mission?

02:49.270 --> 02:51.439
Yeah.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.974
Every time we fail,
it just gets harder

02:54.007 --> 02:55.676
to reset.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.579
We didn't get our guys,

02:58.612 --> 03:01.249
but we will.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.954
And you... you...

03:06.987 --> 03:09.457
you were a badass.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.624
(laughing):
Yeah.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.526
Fixing the tail rotor...
Mm-hmm.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.828
Pilot and engineer?
Come on.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.231
It was a hero move.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.234
I tried my best.
I know.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.935
The rest of the unit
knows it, too.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.206
Sure hope you're
right about that.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.743
I am going to make

03:29.777 --> 03:31.279
some breakfast-- you in?

03:31.312 --> 03:34.248
Sorry, babe,
I got to go to work.

03:34.282 --> 03:38.819
Oh, by the way,

03:38.852 --> 03:40.721
my mom is in town,

03:40.754 --> 03:44.992
and she is hosting a campaign
fund-raiser tomorrow night.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.027
She wants us to go.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.662
Yay.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.731
It'll be good to get out,
you know?

03:50.764 --> 03:53.767
Get dressed up,
pretend to be fancy.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.536
Okay.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.970
Hey, uh,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.972
I know you probably
can't say anything...

03:59.006 --> 04:00.841
But...

04:00.874 --> 04:03.277
But that hospital in Somalia,

04:03.311 --> 04:04.412
the hidden room
behind the cabinet--

04:04.445 --> 04:05.579
what was in there?

04:05.613 --> 04:08.349
The CIA won't tell me either.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.457
Come in.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.958
You wanted to see me, sir.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.860
Have a seat.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.298
According to Sergeant
Darzi's debrief,

04:24.332 --> 04:27.000
Madani gave him painkillers
from a personal stash.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.736
Do you know anything about this?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.039
No, sir.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.774
Her doctor fold me she
completed her prescription

04:33.807 --> 04:35.443
and had no refills left.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.345
You are her
commanding officer.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.646
You need to get
to the bottom of this.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.381
Yes, sir.
72 hours from now,

04:40.414 --> 04:41.982
you're both back on
standby for deployment.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.385
I want your answer by then--
is Madani good to fly or not?

04:44.418 --> 04:47.388
Is that understood?
Lima Charlie, Sir.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.323
You're dismissed.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.666
HASKINS: I'll turn it over
to Director Magnus.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.468
MAGNUS: Officer Thea's
off on assignment at the moment,

05:00.501 --> 05:02.803
so I'll be running point for
the Agency-- hold the applause.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.339
Our ground ops team
uncovered a key

05:05.373 --> 05:07.641
piece of intel
on the mission.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.044
Forensics confirms that it is
Sergeant Kam's handwriting.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.046
Decoding this message
goes to the top

05:13.080 --> 05:14.482
of everybody's to-do list.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.485
Negotiations with Khalid
have broken off,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.820
he's not responding--
this is the lead we've got.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.121
That's all for now.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.925
All non-Agency personnel
are dismissed.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.031
Sir, uh, I have an idea

05:31.064 --> 05:32.566
of someone
who can help decode this.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.934
Mind if I chase that down?

05:33.967 --> 05:36.003
By all means, Lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.007
Hey.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.675
You think Thea's assignment
has anything to do

05:41.709 --> 05:43.110
with the secret room
in that hospital?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.112
You know, that's the
last thing on my mind.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.481
Is this about the pills?

05:47.515 --> 05:49.583
Haskins knows you
gave 'em to Darzi.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.385
It was in his debrief.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.653
Haskins also told me

05:52.686 --> 05:54.054
you should be done
with your prescription,

05:54.087 --> 05:55.623
so why are you
still taking 'em?

05:55.656 --> 05:56.990
You don't need to worry
about that.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.459
You lied to me.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.693
You got a legit script,
that's one thing,

05:59.727 --> 06:00.794
but you're taking pills...

06:00.828 --> 06:02.730
Hey, I flew fine.
You saw that.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.164
I should have reported you
the second we landed.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.401
But you didn't,
because you need me.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.004
Well, I'm worried about you.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.039
Colonel is, too.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.444
He put it on me to
clear you to fly...

06:16.477 --> 06:17.678
or not.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.147
So, what, the men just
sit behind closed doors

06:20.180 --> 06:21.882
deciding my fate?
Come on, it's not about that.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.417
I'm your supervisor.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.952
It is my job to
make this decision.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.620
You can't ground me,

06:26.654 --> 06:28.422
not after everything
that's happened

06:28.456 --> 06:30.090
and everything we still
have to figure out.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.594
Thea is missing, we have no idea
what the CIA is up to,

06:33.627 --> 06:36.096
or what was in that room,
or how to get Jimmy...
Stop, stop!

06:36.129 --> 06:39.633
If I clear you, and it blows
up in my face, that's it.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.603
We'd both be off
this rescue mission.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.071
We wouldn't get any answers.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.072
Well, then, I guess
just let me know

06:45.105 --> 06:46.907
when the verdict is in.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.722
It's okay, Mrs. Kam,
I don't have bad news.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.991
I should remind you

07:04.024 --> 07:06.494
that anything I share with you
is confidential.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.528
Of course.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.163
I'm just surprised,
is all.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.634
Anyone sharing anything...
feels like Christmas.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.868
(chuckles)

07:14.902 --> 07:16.737
You know Jimmy better
than anyone.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.039
He left a message
we're trying to decode

07:19.072 --> 07:20.808
in the location where
he was being held

07:20.841 --> 07:22.242
with Sergeant Hendrix.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.245
They were moved before
we could get there.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.914
And you don't know
where he is now?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.148
We're working on that.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.750
He wrote the message
on the floor--

07:29.783 --> 07:31.084
three words:

07:31.118 --> 07:34.154
"Tokyo" and "small pearl."

07:34.187 --> 07:36.223
Do you have any idea
what those could mean?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.758
I don't know
what "small pearl" means,

07:37.791 --> 07:42.162
but "Tokyo" was a...
a personal thing...

07:42.195 --> 07:44.031
between Jimmy and I.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.733
Do you know why he
would have written it?

07:45.766 --> 07:49.169
He wants me to know
he hasn't given up.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.238
I know how hard this is.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.877
Is that all that you have
to help find him, Colonel?

07:56.910 --> 07:59.046
Three words?
Right now, yes.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.516
All this time I have been
trusting in the system.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.752
I signed an NDA for you.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.286
I listened to your wife
when she told me

08:06.319 --> 08:09.823
that I needed to hold on,
as I wake up every morning

08:09.857 --> 08:11.559
wondering if today
is going to be the day

08:11.592 --> 08:13.627
that somebody shows up
on my front doorstep

08:13.661 --> 08:16.797
with nothing but a folded flag
and empty condolences.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.667
Mrs. Kam...
Is my husband coming
home alive, Colonel?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.836
We are doing
everything we can.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.171
Tell me why,
after all this time,

08:24.204 --> 08:25.305
I should keep trusting you.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.307
Because we are the best option

08:27.340 --> 08:29.710
for bringing your husband home.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.314
(coughing)

08:34.347 --> 08:36.216
We lost them.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.285
You okay?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.820
I think I cracked a rib.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.321
I'll take first watch.
You rest.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.323
Hey, we did it.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.658
We actually got away.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.126
(sniffles, sighs)

08:46.159 --> 08:48.328
(men speaking
in foreign language)

08:48.361 --> 08:50.898
Not yet.
(groaning)

08:52.900 --> 08:55.302
(upbeat, instrumental
rock music playing)

08:55.335 --> 08:56.937
(door closes)

09:05.378 --> 09:07.615
(music stops)
You don't knock?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.082
Your door was unlocked.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.884
You wouldn't have heard me
anyway.
(sighs)

09:10.918 --> 09:13.086
What are you doing here?
Proving a point.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.624
Hey!

09:16.657 --> 09:17.625
Don't touch my stuff!

09:17.658 --> 09:19.627
What are you doing?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.261
Gallo!

09:21.294 --> 09:23.664
Hey, Gallo, stop it!
Where do you keep them?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.966
Stop. What?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.868
Show me!

09:37.645 --> 09:39.613
Hid those bad boys
pretty deep

09:39.647 --> 09:41.615
for someone who doesn't have
a problem.
Yeah.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.916
I'm under a ton of pressure.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.384
You should know that.
We're all under pressure.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.353
You don't see the rest of us
numbing out.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.088
How were you even
gonna keep this up?

09:48.121 --> 09:50.023
What happens at the next
routine drug test?
Nothing.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.925
Because I'm over it.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.094
Take 'em. I don't
need them anymore.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.363
They were a safety
blanket at best.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.766
And I'll prove it to you.
I'll do a flight eval.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.168
Any course you want,
I will fly it.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.637
Whatever it's gonna take
so that I can prove to you

10:03.671 --> 10:06.606
once and for all that
I am squared away.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.179
Meet me at the track at 1000.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.281
The track?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.650
You heard me.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.753
Roger that, sir.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.428
Magnus. Got a minute?

10:28.461 --> 10:32.332
You know, I love a
good French press.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.334
Most people think the difference
is in the beans.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.069
It's really in the brew.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.206
Walk with me, Colonel.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.408
I need to know why you shut
my team out of the briefing.

10:41.441 --> 10:42.275
Part of the briefing.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.878
I was discussing
a private Agency matter.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.080
Closed doors send a message
to my guys, that they don't

10:47.114 --> 10:48.315
have all the facts.
Well, your guys

10:48.348 --> 10:50.050
are on a need-to-know basis.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.320
The only way this mission
succeeds is if we work together.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.690
What I was discussing,
behind closed doors,

10:56.724 --> 10:58.726
was CIA Officer Richard.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.160
Is there news?
No.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.462
And that's a problem.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.298
We are shifting resources
away from the search.

11:05.332 --> 11:10.170
We are not giving up entirely,
but we are being pragmatic.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.172
Richard's been gone for weeks.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.941
He was last seen
with a dangerous prisoner.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.475
The chances of finding him alive

11:15.508 --> 11:17.010
grow slimmer
with each passing day.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.345
This is a reality

11:18.378 --> 11:19.947
that you may have
to face soon, too.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.181
I'm sorry?

11:21.214 --> 11:22.415
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix

11:22.449 --> 11:24.184
have been missing just as long.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.820
Operation Perseus
has not gone well.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.991
We are starting to
lose political capital.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.460
I don't leave my men behind.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.032
(birds chirping)

11:41.201 --> 11:43.136
(coughing, grunting)

11:43.170 --> 11:45.172
(panting)

11:49.076 --> 11:50.510
There was a moment

11:50.543 --> 11:53.013
you could've escaped
the truck without me.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.247
But you stayed.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.452
You saved my life.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.054
You would've done the same.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.891
Yeah.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.760
(panting)

12:06.794 --> 12:08.528
I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.464
But you're
my brother.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.768
I got your six, man.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.770
Always.
(chuckles)

12:16.804 --> 12:19.907
Few weeks ago, I wasn't so sure.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.009
Lot's happened in a few weeks.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.412
No. No, no. Come on.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.047
We stick to the plan, we head
straight for the border.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.282
We don't know how
far away that is.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.918
All we have is a direction.

12:30.951 --> 12:31.985
We can't go knocking on houses

12:32.019 --> 12:33.086
asking if there's room
at the inn.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.121
We're on the run from a warlord

12:34.154 --> 12:35.155
who controls the whole area.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.389
Not everyone's bad.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.891
If we stay out here,

12:37.925 --> 12:39.960
there's no telling
who we could run into.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.428
At least,
at that house,

12:41.461 --> 12:43.797
there's some hope for safety.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.898
No.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.399
(coughing)

12:46.433 --> 12:47.935
(sniffles)

12:50.337 --> 12:52.806
All right.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.574
All right, let's give it a shot.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.177
Yeah.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.212
(panting)

13:00.447 --> 13:03.483
* Oh, oh, oh...

13:03.516 --> 13:06.053
GALLO:
Morning, Madani.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.254
Hooah.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.488
All right.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.923
You'll be doing
a fitness test.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.492
I need a hundred push-ups,
hundred sit-ups,

13:12.525 --> 13:14.862
and under 12
on the two-mile run.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.263
Oh, come on.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.498
Maybe about five percent
of the unit can do that.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.500
You said you'd do
whatever it took.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.502
I know what I said.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.904
And I will, sir.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.406
Let's start
with a little warm-up sprint.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.375
Three, two, one, go!

13:28.408 --> 13:30.543
* Oh, oh, oh

13:30.577 --> 13:33.881
* Oh, yeah.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.287
Professor Benning?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.521
You must be

13:41.554 --> 13:43.390
Lieutenant Porter. Come in.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.528
It's nice
to meet you.

13:48.561 --> 13:52.432
You're... younger than
I expected, ma'am.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.034
For having published
in so many journals.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.903
Flattery will
get you everywhere.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.573
So, how can I help you?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.876
You're an expert on the Puntland
region in Somalia.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.611
Just returned
from a trip there, actually.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.913
Research?

14:05.946 --> 14:06.980
Uh, not this time.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.615
I was visiting her parents.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.918
She was my interpreter.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.052
She passed away recently.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.887
I'm sorry.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.655
It's a dangerous part
of the world.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.557
Yes.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.027
Ma'am, I'm here because you have
some familiarity

14:20.060 --> 14:21.661
with Khalid Samatar.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.331
Convinced him to sit
for an interview once.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.299
Yes. I read it.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.135
The U.S. Army needs help
in decoding a phrase

14:28.168 --> 14:29.903
associated with Khalid.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.405
And as I mentioned on the phone,
this is classified.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.307
Understood.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.943
The phrase is "small pearl."
I think

14:35.976 --> 14:37.644
it might have to do
with a location?

14:37.677 --> 14:40.247
Well, in Arabic, "small pearl"
translates loosely to dorra.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.049
Which is a city in Djibouti.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.683
That's what I thought, too,
but Djibouti is covered

14:43.716 --> 14:45.318
with U.S. armed forces.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.520
It seems unlikely
that a man like Khalid

14:47.554 --> 14:49.356
would be operating from there.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.526
I have also heard the phrase as
a nickname for a different town.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.694
Uh, local slang.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.197
Somewhere in Ethiopia.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.666
I think somewhere near a river?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.701
I can't remember
the name, though.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.638
Well, that's...
it's something, at least.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.340
More than we had before.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.708
I wish I could be more helpful.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.110
Thank you for your time.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.947
MADANI:
97...

15:13.981 --> 15:15.983
98.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.617
99.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.652
And... time.
100.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.688
(panting)

15:26.693 --> 15:27.660
(chuckles)

15:27.694 --> 15:29.129
I beat it, didn't I?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.630
Color me impressed.
(laughs)

15:30.663 --> 15:33.500
Great. So I'm cleared to fly.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.102
No. Not so fast.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.303
What?

15:36.336 --> 15:37.504
Physically, you're good.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.706
Up here? I'm not so sure.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.641
I did everything you asked.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.476
What's it gonna take
for you to believe me?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.046
Watch your tone.
I'm your commanding officer.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.547
Our relationship
is more complicated

15:47.580 --> 15:48.982
than soldier
and commander,

15:49.016 --> 15:50.050
and you know it.

15:52.019 --> 15:52.752
(laughs softly)

15:52.785 --> 15:54.187
Oh.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.690
This isn't reform.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.392
It's punishment.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.528
You wanted me to fail. You...
Come on.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.663
Madani...
You wanted me to fail because
then, you wouldn't be saddled

16:03.696 --> 16:07.000
with the responsibility
of making this decision.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.269
That's some real leadership
right there, Captain.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.671
Don't talk to me
about leadership.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.606
You lied to me.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.209
If we can't trust each other,
we can't trust anyone.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.710
I believe you said that once.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.114
The pills are behind me.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.050
I'm fine.
For today.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.418
What about tomorrow?
And the day after that?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.487
You need someone to
hold you accountable.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.222
That's recovery 101.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.558
And Ian, he doesn't know,
does he?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.493
How committed to cleaning
up are you, really,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.795
if you're hiding that from him?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.797
Fine, then I'll tell him.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.167
If that's the confirmation
that you need.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.768
It's not about what I need.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.770
It's your decision
to make, isn't it?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.805
So tell me,
you gonna ground me?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.474
Haven't made my mind up yet.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.222
(birds chirping)

17:02.255 --> 17:04.023
(goat braying)

17:52.872 --> 17:54.807
(grunts)

17:59.879 --> 18:02.582
(coughing)

18:08.188 --> 18:10.323
(phone rings)
(knocking on door)

18:12.825 --> 18:15.195
ASSISTANT: Mrs. Porter,
Mrs. Kam is here to see you.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.397
SIMONE:
So sorry we made you wait.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.799
I have been dealing
with some last minute details

18:19.832 --> 18:22.202
for my fund-raiser tomorrow.
Go on, please, sit.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.405
I'm just grateful that you took
the time to see me at all.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.906
I know that you
are very busy.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.141
What with running
for reelection and all.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.642
(laughs softly)

18:29.676 --> 18:30.877
I always have time
for a friend of Ian's.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.312
What's on your mind?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.481
My husband. Jimmy Kam.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.484
I've been read in
on the situation.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.851
I'm aware he's a P.O.W.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.188
Well, I've been doing
some research

18:41.221 --> 18:44.891
on the P.O.W./M.I.A.
movement in Vietnam.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.726
Congress helped to bring
a bunch of them home.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.261
Mrs. Kam,

18:48.295 --> 18:50.163
there is an interagency team
working tirelessly

18:50.197 --> 18:51.898
to find your husband.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.866
I know. I just thought maybe
if you spoke about it publicly,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.835
and you put some
political pressure...

18:55.868 --> 18:58.538
Information regarding this
operation must remain secret.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.772
(sighs)

18:59.806 --> 19:02.242
Publicity can often
be detrimental.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.345
My son is growing up
without his father.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.214
That is detrimental.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.851
Public pressure has worked
in the past, sure.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.754
But it opens
a large can of worms.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.957
And once we share how we do
the things that we do,

19:17.990 --> 19:20.360
people have opinions.
And then we spend more time

19:20.393 --> 19:24.464
explaining our methods
than actually doing anything.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.598
All due respect, ma'am,
I'm not sure

19:25.632 --> 19:27.200
how much you're doing right now.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.501
I'm sorry.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.936
That's all the time that I have.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.504
Thank you so much
for coming to see me.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.972
Please know

19:33.005 --> 19:35.608
that we are sympathetic
to your situation.

19:35.642 --> 19:40.680
And we all want your husband
to come home safe and sound.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.882
Thank you.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.520
This has been very enlightening.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.822
Mm...

19:56.829 --> 19:58.431
(knocking on door)

20:09.576 --> 20:11.578
As-salaam alaikum.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.215
(indistinct chatter in distance)

20:17.917 --> 20:19.586
(sighs)

20:22.489 --> 20:23.990
(groans)

20:26.759 --> 20:28.928
(grunts)

20:28.961 --> 20:30.763
We have to go, fast. You good?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.999
I'm fine.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.807
Coast is clear. Time to go.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.014
Come on.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.023
Hey, you.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.360
You got much longer?

21:00.393 --> 21:04.030
I thought maybe
you could come over.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.534
(groans)

21:07.567 --> 21:09.502
I am gonna be here
all night.

21:09.536 --> 21:12.339
But I promise

21:12.372 --> 21:13.840
I will make it up
to you tomorrow night.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.575
At your mother's
campaign event?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.910
(groans)
(laughs)

21:17.944 --> 21:21.047
After that?
(laughs)

21:23.082 --> 21:25.452
I'm sorry. I got
to get back to this.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.954
Of course.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.389
Hey.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.693
I don't say it enough,
but I'm...

21:33.726 --> 21:35.395
I'm so damn proud of you.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.667
Says the man burning
the midnight oil.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.737
Proud of you, too.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.305
Thank you, babe.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.079
You good?

21:55.081 --> 21:57.417
Yeah, I just...

22:03.856 --> 22:05.892
Just good luck.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.799
Hi.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.534
Hey.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.569
Everything okay with Nora?

22:16.603 --> 22:18.438
Why wouldn't it be?

22:21.073 --> 22:22.675
No reason.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.511
Just checking in on my team.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.912
(taps desk)

22:25.945 --> 22:27.880
Keep on keeping on.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.027
(computer beeps)

22:42.429 --> 22:44.431
(types)
(computer beeps)

22:49.936 --> 22:51.971
HASKINS:
Come in.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.040
Sir.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.942
I found something on
an NSA listening station.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.844
Chatter about a deal
between a Somali warlord

22:57.877 --> 23:00.112
and an ISIS cell in Motta.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.514
And that's right here
on the Blue Nile River.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.149
Now, according to my contact,

23:03.182 --> 23:06.519
"Small Pearl" is a nickname
for an Ethiopian river town.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.155
It's a sale of weapons
and two packages.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.123
"Two packages" could be
Kam and Hendrix.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.426
Yes, sir, but why would Khalid
sell them?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.994
Prisoner exchange
fell through.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.062
If he hasn't guessed
his brother's dead,

23:16.095 --> 23:17.930
at least Khalid knows
he's not getting him back.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.867
Maybe he's decided to
dump 'em and cash out.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.535
This is good intel,
Lieutenant.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.970
Excellent work.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.472
Thank you, sir.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.040
Sir, can I ask you...

23:29.542 --> 23:31.611
How do you stay so calm
throughout all this?

23:31.644 --> 23:34.814
I don't let you see
the times I'm not.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.082
That's my job.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.084
(knocking on door)

23:39.118 --> 23:41.821
Morning, gentlemen.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.423
We have a lead.
Lieutenant Porter found it.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.896
Outstanding.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.698
Meet me in the
briefing room in five.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.174
You slept here,
didn't you?

24:02.208 --> 24:05.545
Uh, yes, sir.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.113
You guys have showers here
for a reason, Porter.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.048
You going to your
mother's event tonight?

24:09.081 --> 24:11.217
Are you?
No.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.986
No. But William Francis is.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.123
Deputy director, CIA. You should
have your mother introduce you.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.091
He's a good contact.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.528
Could be helpful
to your future.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.101
Hey.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.570
Your message
sounded urgent.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.904
Are you all right?

24:31.938 --> 24:33.139
Ryan, thanks for coming.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.941
In your work at the newspaper,

24:34.974 --> 24:37.610
have you ever been involved in
leaking classified information?

24:37.644 --> 24:39.078
No.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.247
But I know guys who have.
What are the risks?

24:41.280 --> 24:44.016
I mean, I know about
Snowden and all of that,

24:44.050 --> 24:45.785
but does the government
really come down

24:45.818 --> 24:47.186
that hard on
every single leaker?

24:47.219 --> 24:49.221
Not always,

24:49.255 --> 24:50.990
but if the government
prosecutes,

24:51.023 --> 24:53.159
it'll mean jail
time... years.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.227
The guys you know...

24:55.261 --> 24:57.229
how do they stay anonymous?

24:57.263 --> 25:00.166
Burner phones,
midnight meetings,

25:00.199 --> 25:03.002
encrypted e-mail servers,
intense precautions.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.837
Why are you asking me this?

25:04.871 --> 25:08.174
It has to do with Jimmy.

25:08.207 --> 25:12.579
If you decide to go down
this road... call me.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.281
I'll help you protect
yourself as best I can.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.103
So, are you ready
to deploy tomorrow?

25:38.805 --> 25:42.074
Is that even a thing
that people ask?

25:42.108 --> 25:43.610
You always got
to be ready.

25:43.643 --> 25:46.245
This time feels
a bit different, though.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.848
My first time having someone
to come back for.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.318
Listen....

25:52.351 --> 25:56.088
I know it's only
been a few months,

25:56.122 --> 25:58.658
but I'm really
falling for you, Jess.
I'm pregnant.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.094
I took the test a few days ago,

26:02.128 --> 26:05.698
and the doctor
confirmed it today.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.001
I'm six weeks.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.337
What are you thinking?

26:11.370 --> 26:13.906
I want to keep it.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.042
Okay.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.310
Look,

26:18.344 --> 26:20.980
if this isn't something
that you want, um,

26:21.013 --> 26:22.982
you don't have to be
a part of it. I can...

26:23.015 --> 26:24.884
Having a baby with you

26:24.917 --> 26:27.319
would make me the happiest man
in the world.

26:27.353 --> 26:31.090
But, Jess, military
life is hard.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.059
You didn't choose this world,
I did.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.163
When I was a kid,

26:37.196 --> 26:41.200
my dad got offered
a job in Tokyo,

26:41.233 --> 26:43.335
and he didn't go for it.

26:43.369 --> 26:46.873
I guess he just didn't trust
that it would work out,

26:46.906 --> 26:48.708
but he regretted it...

26:48.741 --> 26:51.243
and he talked about it

26:51.277 --> 26:54.180
for the rest of his life.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.949
I don't want to be
scared like that.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.218
I trust in this
and in you,

26:59.251 --> 27:01.654
in how this feels.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.258
And I did choose this world...

27:06.292 --> 27:08.928
the moment I chose you.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.363
All right.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.365
Let's have a baby.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.102
(laughing):
Okay.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.170
And I'll take you both
all over the world

27:18.204 --> 27:19.806
anywhere you want to go.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.209
Tokyo?

27:23.242 --> 27:26.846
Definitely Tokyo.
(laughs)

27:31.483 --> 27:33.452
* Time...

27:33.485 --> 27:35.955
So who are
these people, even?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.890
I don't know.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.359
I know that the deputy
director of the CIA

27:40.392 --> 27:42.128
is here somewhere.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.164
Mmm, impressive.

27:45.197 --> 27:49.035
Wait. What would you think if I
went to go work for the CIA?

27:49.068 --> 27:51.070
You know, I mean,
like down the line.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.439
Is that something
you want?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.341
I don't know.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.277
Magnus mentioned it, and...

27:58.310 --> 28:00.412
civilian intel
offers more access,

28:00.446 --> 28:02.381
there's more freedom
to get things done.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.950
MADANI:
Freedom is good.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.351
Freedom is good.
Well, it's...

28:05.384 --> 28:06.986
Don't you two
clean up nice.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.420
Ah, hi, Ma.
Hi, doll.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.889
(chuckles)
Mwah.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.223
Good turnout.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.892
Therese!

28:12.925 --> 28:14.126
Oh, it's lovely
to see you, Simone.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.394
Lovely to see you.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.896
You remember my son Ian.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.931
Senator McLean, it's
good to see you again.

28:18.965 --> 28:22.234
Lieutenant Porter.
Your dad would be proud.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.236
This is my girlfriend.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.105
Chief Warrant Officer
Nora Madani.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.108
Hi, nice to meet you.
I've heard of you.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.944
You're the first female pilot
in Special Ops Aviation.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.146
Right?
Yes, ma'am.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.481
Well, it's an honor.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.283
SIMONE:
Do you mind

28:37.316 --> 28:38.450
if I steal my son?

28:38.484 --> 28:39.451
Of course not.

28:39.485 --> 28:42.021
(all laugh)

28:42.054 --> 28:44.456
Wow. Nora looks good.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.158
She's ambitious.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.860
I admire her,
you know that.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.495
It takes a lot to
get to where she is.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.031
But she will always put
her career before you.
Mom, please.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.465
Don't start with
that right now.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.134
Mmm, if you want to run
for office one day,

28:55.167 --> 28:57.403
you'll need to find a wife
who understands politics.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.271
Someone who can focus
on messaging and campaigning.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.473
Yeah.
Not someone who is deployed

29:01.507 --> 29:04.343
on secret ops and leaves
on a moment's notice.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.179
Again, that is not
my dream, it is yours.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.116
It is yours. Honey, I see it
in your work ethic

29:10.149 --> 29:12.018
and your drive.
You want big things.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.186
I want 'em for you.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.754
And so does she.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.358
JIMMY:
They're after us.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.127
We have to move faster.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.394
I'm sorry,
I can't.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.395
Yes, you can.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.766
(grunts)

29:29.401 --> 29:32.371
(groans, coughs)

29:32.404 --> 29:33.973
That's much worse
than a cracked rib.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.408
It's a lot worse.
I didn't want to tell you.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.812
Okay. Okay.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.547
Let me help you.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.949
You need
to leave me.
No.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.316
I'm just
slowing you down.
No!

29:44.350 --> 29:45.184
No way in hell
I'm leaving you.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.419
Don't be stupid,
they're right after us.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.299
* We could spend the night
(knocking on door)

30:00.332 --> 30:02.101
* I've grown tired

30:02.134 --> 30:05.304
* Of this place

30:05.337 --> 30:08.507
* We could start again...

30:08.540 --> 30:10.409
GALLO:
Hey.
Captain Gallo.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.244
Thanks for
letting me come by.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.113
I brought some brews.
(laughs)

30:14.146 --> 30:16.015
I don't know if this is
a bad time.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.516
Not at all.
All right.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.485
Thank you.
Yeah.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.453
You know, I've been
a bad friend.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.855
I haven't checked in
on you enough.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.291
You've been busy.
That's no excuse.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.627
How are you?
Honestly?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.462
I'm trapped inside
of my own head,

30:30.496 --> 30:32.498
and I would rather
talk about, literally,

30:32.531 --> 30:34.967
anything except for myself.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.937
So how are you?

30:37.970 --> 30:39.505
Need some advice.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.174
I know you're good
at that kind of thing,

30:42.208 --> 30:44.110
or at least that's what
Nora tells me.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.178
I can try. What's up?

30:46.212 --> 30:48.514
I got to make a decision.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.017
No idea what to do.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.484
Well, what are your options?

30:52.518 --> 30:53.920
Well...

30:54.987 --> 30:56.455
...if I play it safe,

30:56.488 --> 30:59.191
you know, and I...
I do the thing

30:59.225 --> 31:01.660
that I know won't
get me in trouble,

31:01.693 --> 31:03.562
it could really destroy
someone else.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.665
But if I take a risk, if I trust
this person and it goes wrong,

31:06.698 --> 31:08.134
we'll both be screwed.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.136
Well, how well
do you know this person?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.570
Pretty well, I'd like to think.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.907
Never mix the professional
and the personal.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.909
Messes everything up.

31:16.943 --> 31:21.647
When Jimmy and I decided
to have Max, it seemed crazy.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.684
But I just had this faith

31:25.717 --> 31:28.287
that he would be
a good father

31:28.320 --> 31:30.589
and a really
good husband.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.658
So I guess the question is,
do you think that this person

31:32.691 --> 31:34.393
is going to let you down,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.495
or do you believe that
they will follow through?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.133
(inhales)

31:41.167 --> 31:43.169
I think I have my answer.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.638
SIMONE:
As many of you know,

31:46.672 --> 31:48.707
my husband died
in the 1993 attack

31:48.740 --> 31:50.542
on the World Trade Center.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.145
After that, I was lost.

31:53.179 --> 31:57.616
A widow with a young son,
an overwhelming city.

31:57.649 --> 32:00.586
(Southern accent):
So, I came home to Georgia.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.622
(laughter)
Best decision I ever made.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.624
When I first ran for office,
I wanted to give back

32:05.657 --> 32:08.694
to a community that helped me
get back on my feet.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.263
Now, I can't imagine
doing anything else.

32:11.297 --> 32:14.033
And I look forward to doing that
for another term.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.601
I'd also like to honor

32:15.634 --> 32:17.736
the men and women
of our military tonight.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.673
They selflessly put their duty
to their country over all else.

32:21.707 --> 32:25.677
They make
incredible sacrifices.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.279
We have two of these heroes
with us here.

32:27.313 --> 32:30.116
My son,
Lieutenant Ian Porter,

32:30.149 --> 32:33.052
and Chief Warrant Officer
Nora Madani.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.225
Hooah! (chuckles)
(laughter)

32:39.258 --> 32:40.392
Uh, I will wrap this up.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.561
Thank you so much
for your support.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.562
Enjoy your evening.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.731
Thank you.
(applause)

32:46.365 --> 32:47.599
Excuse me.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.135
I just want to say thank
you for your service.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.570
Just doing my job.
Don't be modest.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.239
You're a role model
for young women everywhere.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.076
* I put my arms

32:57.109 --> 32:59.011
Hey, uh,

32:59.045 --> 33:00.779
I'm not feeling well,

33:00.812 --> 33:02.114
so I'm gonna go.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.482
Well, I'll go with you.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.151
We'll go.
No.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.153
Stay.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.787
Call me later.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.289
* Over me

33:10.322 --> 33:11.790
SIMONE:
Ian?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.192
Ian. This is

33:13.225 --> 33:16.162
William Francis,
deputy director of the CIA.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.164
Ian, Director Magnus speaks

33:18.197 --> 33:20.099
very highly of you.
Oh, uh, thank you.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.700
I'm sorry, sir. I got to go.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.702
Officer Francis is in town
for one night only, dear.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.071
He's looking forward
to meeting you.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.506
I appreciate that. Thank you.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.141
But I'm sorry.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.743
* I will not move.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.318
(line ringing)

33:39.351 --> 33:42.121
Hey, Kevin, it's Nora.
Can you meet up?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.422
I need some more pills.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.091
Nora.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.725
(line clicks)

33:46.758 --> 33:49.128
Who were you
talking to?

33:50.629 --> 33:52.564
No one.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.439
Gallo asked me
if you're doing okay.

34:00.472 --> 34:04.042
Is there something
that he knows that I don't?

34:05.311 --> 34:06.278
Is there something going on?

34:06.312 --> 34:08.714
Just-just tell me.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.758
I felt like a
hypocrite in there.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.660
I've been taking
painkillers,

34:21.693 --> 34:23.829
even after my
prescription ran out.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.832
What?

34:26.865 --> 34:28.167
(scoffs)

34:28.200 --> 34:29.268
Wh-Why would you...

34:29.301 --> 34:30.602
Because of the pain.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.138
And then the pressures
of the mission and...

34:34.906 --> 34:37.109
And now, I guess,
it's just for everything.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.744
This is what you've been keeping
from me since you got back.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.613
I just thought

34:41.647 --> 34:43.682
if I could pretend
like everything was fine,

34:43.715 --> 34:46.818
then... then
it would be.

34:46.852 --> 34:47.753
Why didn't you tell me?

34:47.786 --> 34:50.322
I didn't want you to get
involved in my mess.

34:50.356 --> 34:54.160
I've been so busy. I... My head
has been so far into the work.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.794
I haven't... I should've noticed

34:55.827 --> 34:57.196
that you were dealing
with this, that...

34:57.229 --> 34:58.697
It's not your fault.
Yes,

34:58.730 --> 35:00.366
it is a little.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.202
(sighs)

35:03.235 --> 35:06.172
I want to be done with this.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.807
I need to be
over this.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.276
I just...

35:10.309 --> 35:13.179
I don't know
how to do that alone.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.586
(exhales)

35:22.254 --> 35:24.156
I will help you.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.830
(crying)

35:34.500 --> 35:35.901
(grunting)

35:35.934 --> 35:39.405
Okay.
(grunting)

35:39.438 --> 35:40.639
Crank, you with me?

35:40.672 --> 35:41.807
You still with me?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.942
(weakly):
Yeah.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.612
Not for much longer.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.347
Hey, hey. I'm still with you.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.915
I'm not going anywhere.

35:49.948 --> 35:53.352
(panting): It's been an honor
to serve alongside you,

35:53.385 --> 35:55.921
Sergeant Kam.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.424
(panting)

35:58.457 --> 36:00.759
The honor...

36:00.792 --> 36:02.661
is all mine, Sergeant Hendrix.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.730
(mutters)

36:04.763 --> 36:06.198
Huh?

36:06.232 --> 36:08.567
(panting)

36:08.600 --> 36:11.537
I need you to say
a prayer for me.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.939
The only prayer I know
is from the Koran.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.541
That's fine.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.843
Just... about...

36:17.876 --> 36:20.779
peace and the hereafter.
Okay. Okay.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.248
All that crap.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.683
(sniffles)
Okay?

36:24.716 --> 36:26.385
(gasping)

36:26.418 --> 36:28.820
(speaking Arabic)

36:33.425 --> 36:36.194
(groaning, exhales)

36:38.297 --> 36:40.232
(brush rustling)

36:40.266 --> 36:42.601
(indistinct shouting)

37:04.323 --> 37:06.725
Hey.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.728
I told Ian.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.497
Recovery 101.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.864
I'm glad.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.402
I know it might be
too late to make amends.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.003
I'll understand
if you decided to ground me.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.905
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the commander.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.877
Take a seat.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.813
Chatter indicates
that Sergeants Kam

37:27.846 --> 37:30.549
and Hendrix are en route
to Motta, Ethiopia,

37:30.582 --> 37:34.386
as part of an arms exchange
between Khalid and an ISIS cell.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.887
We are going to intercept
that shipment.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.390
Captain Gallo
will be flying lead,

37:38.424 --> 37:39.891
along with Chief Madani.

37:48.634 --> 37:49.935
Colonel, a moment.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.603
You have something for me?

37:51.637 --> 37:53.405
Colonel.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.908
(quietly):
Sergeant Hendrix is dead.

38:00.546 --> 38:03.081
We received this photo today
through an anonymous

38:03.114 --> 38:06.352
file-sharing site. We believe
it's a message from Khalid.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.388
Retaliation for the prisoner
exchange going sideways.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.690
What's the meaning
of the domino?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.625
Afraid that answer's above your
security clearance, Colonel.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.327
This is my
operation, too.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.695
I need to know
what's going on here.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.464
I'll keep that in mind.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.533
There is some good news.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.535
We intercepted chatter
indicating

38:23.569 --> 38:25.537
that Sergeant Kam
is still alive.

38:25.571 --> 38:29.441
My guess is he's still a part of
that shipment headed to Motta.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.980
And I'll let you share this
with your team as you see fit.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.855
*

38:43.889 --> 38:46.324
(sighs)

38:58.770 --> 38:59.738
(grunting)

38:59.771 --> 39:02.741
* Not gonna break me

39:02.774 --> 39:06.144
* Not gonna break me down

39:06.177 --> 39:08.614
* Not gonna break me

39:08.647 --> 39:10.749
* This time around

39:10.782 --> 39:12.984
* Say hello to the pain

39:13.018 --> 39:17.055
* Hurting me so bad

39:17.088 --> 39:19.725
* Bleed the life from me, yeah

39:19.758 --> 39:22.961
* Bleed the life from me

39:22.994 --> 39:26.765
* If it's all the same

39:26.798 --> 39:29.501
* I'm gonna play the game

39:29.535 --> 39:32.538
* Say not gonna break me

39:34.806 --> 39:38.677
* Not gonna break me

39:38.710 --> 39:41.513
* Not gonna break me down

39:41.547 --> 39:44.516
* Not gonna break me

39:44.550 --> 39:46.685
* This time around

39:46.718 --> 39:50.522
*

39:50.556 --> 39:53.525
* This time around

39:53.559 --> 39:56.528
* Not gonna break me

39:56.562 --> 39:58.797
* This time around

39:58.830 --> 40:02.200
*

40:02.233 --> 40:05.437
* This time around

40:05.471 --> 40:08.440
* Not gonna break me

40:08.474 --> 40:10.776
* This time around

40:10.809 --> 40:13.679
* Ooh *

40:13.712 --> 40:16.682
I really thought
you'd ground me.

40:16.715 --> 40:20.552
* Ooh *

40:20.586 --> 40:22.888
Thank you for trusting me.

40:22.921 --> 40:26.458
Let's not get all emo about it.

40:26.492 --> 40:30.562
* Ooh... ooh *

40:30.596 --> 40:31.797
Why didn't you?

40:31.830 --> 40:34.533
* Ooh *

40:34.566 --> 40:37.503
Because I know you, Nora.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.838
I trusted you'd get
the help you needed.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.574
And I knew you wouldn't
risk letting Jimmy down.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.576
I'm trying.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.646
But we still have
so far to go.

40:47.679 --> 40:52.984
I still have so far to go
to make everything right.

40:53.018 --> 40:57.222
What'd Ian say
when you told him?

40:59.257 --> 41:02.027
All the right things.

41:04.763 --> 41:07.666
* Ooh *

41:07.699 --> 41:09.501
* This time around

41:09.535 --> 41:11.537
He really loves me.

41:11.570 --> 41:15.507
* This time around,
this time around *

41:15.541 --> 41:17.543
He's good for you.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.945
* Not gonna break me

41:19.978 --> 41:22.514
* This time around.
