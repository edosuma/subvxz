00:06.530 --> 00:09.410
-Dahliano, l...
-Don't speak.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.250
-But l...
-No, no, no, don't speak.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.690
Now you may speak.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.920
Honey, this outfit deserves
more than speaking.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.770
lt deserves the Hannah Happy Dance.

00:20.810 --> 00:24.480
<i>l love my outfi</i> t

00:24.530 --> 00:28.320

<i>l am a geniu</i> s

00:33.090 --> 00:35.400
So, where will we be wearing us?

00:35.450 --> 00:37.680
The Oscars, the Emmys,
the Grammys?

00:37.730 --> 00:38.920
The Sunshine Girls.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.720
l'm being honoured
as their Role Model of the Year!

00:41.770 --> 00:45.440
Why not just take these pins
and jam them into my flesh?

00:45.930 --> 00:48.970
There'll be a tonne of rich moms
asking who l'm wearing.

00:49.010 --> 00:53.610
And that is why, as you can see,
you are my favourite pop star.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.320
Dahli! Hello, Dahli!

00:57.050 --> 00:58.640
lt's lsis!

01:02.250 --> 01:05.319
Move it, pop princess.
The queen has arrived.

01:06.610 --> 01:08.170
lsis! l love her!

01:08.210 --> 01:11.280
<i>lmmaterial Gir</i> l was my theme song
when l was six!

01:11.330 --> 01:12.360
She's my idol!

01:12.410 --> 01:15.290
l hog-called <i>lmpress Yoursel</i> f
at the Buford County fair

01:15.330 --> 01:17.210
and won second prize!

01:17.570 --> 01:18.800
What won first?

01:18.850 --> 01:21.600
Uncle Earl belching
<i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>.

01:22.450 --> 01:26.810
Good story. But stop talking and
help me make this room presentable.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.330
Better.

01:29.370 --> 01:30.440
Hey!

01:30.490 --> 01:31.760
Sweetness, you're adorable,

01:31.810 --> 01:34.770
but you look like
Raggedy Ann threw up all over you.

01:34.810 --> 01:37.610
Darling, l'm here!

01:38.330 --> 01:41.080
Oh, my. lt's you.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.640
lt's me? lt's you!

01:42.690 --> 01:44.920
Yes, it is, but it's also you.
l think you're fabulous.

01:44.970 --> 01:47.320
You think l'm fabulous?
l think you're fabulous!

01:47.370 --> 01:49.520
-Thank you.
-Thank me? Thank you!

01:49.570 --> 01:51.690
l grow tired of this.

01:51.730 --> 01:55.280
So, what bit of brilliance
is my little Dahli creating for you?

01:55.330 --> 01:57.080
This. What do you think?

01:57.810 --> 01:59.770
l love it!

02:02.090 --> 02:05.530
-Can we have a moment?
-Of course.

02:05.570 --> 02:07.530
Darling, do you mind?

02:12.130 --> 02:15.600
l am so glad that you like my outfit.

02:15.650 --> 02:19.960
Darling, l also like seaweed wraps,
but l don't wear them in public.

02:20.410 --> 02:24.120
l mean, look at that thing.
lt's so Hannah Montana.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.610
That's because l am Hannah Montana.

02:26.650 --> 02:29.770
You... You didn't think
l was someone else, did you?

02:29.810 --> 02:33.640
You want to know
how l survived all these years?

02:33.690 --> 02:36.160
Change! Constant change.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.120
New looks, new sound.

02:38.170 --> 02:41.640
You have to know what's next
and do it first, because...

02:41.690 --> 02:43.760
<i>lf you don't chang</i> e
<i>Do a rearrang</i> e

02:43.810 --> 02:45.210
<i>Everyone will g</i> o

02:46.570 --> 02:48.290
''She's boring.''

02:50.130 --> 02:52.090
-They will?
-Yes!

02:52.130 --> 02:56.090
lf you want to stay on top,
you have to think outside the box.

02:56.730 --> 02:59.200
l always have a next, a next-next,

02:59.250 --> 03:03.800
and this morning, during yoga,
l got a glimpse of my next-next-next.

03:03.850 --> 03:08.450
And Antonio Banderas with his leg
behind his head! Wowza!

03:09.690 --> 03:12.970
So, you already
have your next-next-next?

03:13.010 --> 03:15.730
l don't even know
what l'm having for dinner tonight.

03:15.770 --> 03:20.520
ln that case, it was a nice little career.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

03:22.530 --> 03:25.360
l wasn't. Until now.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.050
You're still here?

03:33.050 --> 03:34.560
Hey, Hannah?

03:35.370 --> 03:37.600
Dahliano says we have to go.

03:38.610 --> 03:41.040
What do you want to do next?

03:42.050 --> 03:43.610
l don't know.

Hey, how are you?

04:50.650 --> 04:53.880
lt's such a nice day,
let's go out on the deck and enjoy it.

04:53.930 --> 04:55.600
What do you say?

04:56.210 --> 05:00.120
How can l enjoy the day?
Look at my outfit.

05:01.570 --> 05:05.080
What are you talking about?
lt's classic Hannah Montana.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.560
That's a terrible thing to say!

05:08.410 --> 05:11.320
Of course it is. l hate it. Help me, Lilly.

05:11.370 --> 05:14.880
Well, l would,
but l think l stepped in something.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.170
What?

05:24.210 --> 05:28.000
She met lsis today, who told her
Hannah's career's in trouble.

05:28.090 --> 05:31.400
Honey, now, why would
Hannah's career be in trouble?

05:37.330 --> 05:40.640
Because if she doesn't have
a next-next, she's going to lose her

05:40.690 --> 05:41.760
pants?

05:41.810 --> 05:45.280
-Fans! Fans!
-Fans! Fans!

05:46.730 --> 05:49.040
She thinks if she doesn't change
her sound and her look,

05:49.090 --> 05:50.810
her fans will get bored.

05:51.290 --> 05:54.120
Darling, that's not going to happen.

05:57.610 --> 05:59.250
l can hear him!

06:00.770 --> 06:03.240
You know how much
your audience loves you.

06:03.290 --> 06:06.800
Now. But what about a year from now?

06:06.850 --> 06:10.810
lsis has been on top for 20 years
because she always mixes it up.

06:10.850 --> 06:14.360
Shoot, honey, l know a lot of pop stars
who never mixed it up

06:14.410 --> 06:16.480
and they still have great careers today.

06:16.530 --> 06:17.930
Like who?

06:19.810 --> 06:21.690
Who wants pie?

06:21.730 --> 06:23.290
l'll have pie!

06:34.050 --> 06:36.440
l'm so excited about going out with you
this weekend, Becky.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.800
You won't be sorry
for giving me a second chance.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.400
Or a third chance?

06:45.490 --> 06:48.610
You know what?
You're cute when you're clumsy.

06:48.650 --> 06:51.080
And you're cute
when your nose is bleeding.

06:51.130 --> 06:53.930
Here, let me clean that up for you.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.640
Get out while you can.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.760
He brings everyone down to his level.

07:01.530 --> 07:05.440
Well, l guess
l'll see you Saturday night.

07:05.490 --> 07:08.610
And Thursday and Friday night
from your bushes.

07:10.450 --> 07:12.120
-Go away!
-You go away.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.360
-You go away.
-You go away.

07:14.410 --> 07:18.480
You guys are so funny.
You're like two sisters, but you're boys.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.600
You mean like brothers?

07:23.050 --> 07:24.800
Right. Whatever.

07:27.050 --> 07:28.610
l'm confused.

07:28.650 --> 07:32.610
They say opposites attract,
yet you're both stupid.

07:33.690 --> 07:36.810
l'm going to let you get away with that
because l'm a nice guy

07:36.850 --> 07:39.410
and because l need an advance
on my salary for my date.

07:39.450 --> 07:42.170
-Sure.
-Come on!

07:43.530 --> 07:44.680
What?

07:44.730 --> 07:47.720
As a matter of fact, consider it a gift.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.400
Okay, what's the catch?

07:51.450 --> 07:52.850
No catch.

07:53.330 --> 07:55.800
There is, however, a condition.

07:57.690 --> 07:58.960
For the rest of today,

07:59.010 --> 08:01.920
every time
someone says the word ''dog,''

08:01.970 --> 08:03.800
you have to...

08:05.570 --> 08:07.480
Hot dog over here.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.490
Can we get seven dogs?

08:14.210 --> 08:17.920
Yeah, Rico, l'm barking.
l'm barking all the way to the bank!

08:17.970 --> 08:21.930
Hey, tomorrow,
maybe l can moo for moola.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.520
Let's just see where barking takes us.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.440
-What do you want, honey?
-l'll have a hot dog.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.690
What did you say to her?

08:33.730 --> 08:35.000
Nothing.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.929
Just get her the hot dog.

08:38.610 --> 08:41.200
You calling my girlfriend a dog?

08:45.210 --> 08:47.400
That's it, you're dog meat!

09:02.370 --> 09:05.680
A new sound,
that can't be too hard to come up with.

09:05.730 --> 09:07.720
Hey! Hey, what about hip-hop?

09:07.930 --> 09:09.760
Dude, that'd be totally cool.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.960
l don't know.
You mean like Half-dolla Hannah?

09:17.770 --> 09:20.730
<i>l'm a Half-dolla Hanna</i> h
<i>You can call me five dime</i> s

09:20.770 --> 09:23.330
<i>You can call me anythin</i> g
<i>As long as it rhyme</i> s

09:23.370 --> 09:25.800
<i>And if you don't like i</i> t
<i>Well, l don't really car</i> e

09:25.850 --> 09:28.360
<i>'cause l'm Half-dolla Hanna</i> h
<i>And l got facial hai</i> r

09:28.410 --> 09:29.640
<i>Wor</i> d

09:31.690 --> 09:34.000
'Fraid not.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.810
Well, what about something
a little more retro?

09:37.850 --> 09:40.160
You know, like techno-Hannah.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.890
Techno-Hannah?

09:46.690 --> 09:48.570
<i>clip it, clip i</i> t

09:50.330 --> 09:52.210
<i>clip it real goo</i> d

09:53.330 --> 09:56.290
<i>Then chip it, chip i</i> t
<i>Like Tiger Wood</i> s

10:01.610 --> 10:03.840
That one could hurt people.

10:05.090 --> 10:08.480
l don't understand.
This seems so easy for lsis.

10:08.530 --> 10:12.200
l mean, she can go
from slam rock to glam rock,

10:12.250 --> 10:13.730
from punk to funk.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.410
That's why she's the queen of pop,
and if l don't do something...

10:16.450 --> 10:18.330
You'll be the queen of flop?

10:20.290 --> 10:23.650
Sorry. lt was right there.

10:25.730 --> 10:27.530
l will not be the queen of flop.

10:27.570 --> 10:31.160
lf lsis can do a 1 80 every few years,
so can l.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.200
Wait a minute. That's it!

10:35.250 --> 10:37.160
Of course that's it!

10:38.370 --> 10:39.560
What's it?

10:40.490 --> 10:45.800
l just have to be the opposite
of Hannah. The anti-Hannah.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.680
Of course, the anti-Hannah!

10:49.850 --> 10:51.890
What's the anti-Hannah?

10:52.650 --> 10:54.160
You'll see.

10:58.170 --> 11:02.530
<i>Well, l used to be a nice gir</i> l
<i>Always doing what l'm tol</i> d

11:02.570 --> 11:07.120
<i>And l'm here to tell you, bab</i> y
<i>That it's getting kind of ol</i> d

11:07.170 --> 11:11.800
<i>Say goodbye to all the sparkle</i> s
<i>And all the pretty girly lac</i> e

11:11.850 --> 11:16.680
<i>l'm gonna chew your little heart u</i> p
<i>And then l'll spit it in your fac</i> e

11:18.650 --> 11:21.480
So, what do you think
of the new Hannah?

11:35.290 --> 11:38.730
-l know. Surprising, isn't it?
-Yeah.

11:39.690 --> 11:43.320
-And different, right?
-Surprisingly different.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.880
Exactly what l was going for.
A Hannah no one will expect!

11:48.570 --> 11:50.760
Or ever wants to see again.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.880
At all.

11:55.370 --> 11:57.720
Maybe. l'm just guessing.

11:58.930 --> 12:03.160
All right, l know it's a bit edgy for me,
but that's what lsis says l've got to do.

12:03.210 --> 12:05.120
Surprise my audience.

12:05.530 --> 12:07.410
Well, honey, let's think about this now.

12:07.450 --> 12:08.930
Surprising them is one thing,

12:08.970 --> 12:12.090
but scaring the bejeebees out of them
is another.

12:12.130 --> 12:15.440
Hey, Daddy, l hate to say this,

12:15.490 --> 12:19.370
but you're not exactly the hip audience
l'm trying to reach.

12:19.410 --> 12:22.800
l'll have you know l'm very hip.
Fo'sizzle.

12:24.770 --> 12:27.810
Okay, one, it's fo'shizzle.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.440
Four years ago.

12:32.210 --> 12:36.570
And second,
your idea of a big Saturday night

12:36.610 --> 12:39.040
is sitting on the couch
with your easy-fit jeans unbuttoned

12:39.090 --> 12:42.130
watching
<i>La</i> w & <i>Order: Old coot Division</i>.

12:42.170 --> 12:44.730
Well, l'm sorry l'm such a geezer,

12:44.770 --> 12:46.520
but it didn't seem to bother anybody

12:46.570 --> 12:51.320
when l was writing 1 5 straight
number ones for Hannah Montana,

12:51.370 --> 12:54.360
none of which involved
a face full of sputum.

12:55.610 --> 12:58.810
-Sputum?
-l think it's old-coot for ''spit.''

13:00.570 --> 13:02.840
Y'all like the next Hannah, right?

13:04.410 --> 13:06.240
One second.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.280
We hate her.

13:11.770 --> 13:14.280
-Why?
-She scares us.

13:15.690 --> 13:19.760
-What do you guys know?
-Maybe they know what's good.

13:19.810 --> 13:23.770
Please, they wouldn't know
what good is if it hit them in the face.

13:23.810 --> 13:27.480
Hey, leave us out of
your little disputum.

13:28.370 --> 13:31.360
-Nice wordplay.
-Thank you.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.360
Well, at least we know the title
of Hannah's next album.

13:35.410 --> 13:38.160
<i>Like Me or l'll Hit You in the Face</i>.

13:38.210 --> 13:41.760
Come on. You guys are all
just trying to keep me in a

13:42.730 --> 13:43.920
box.

13:44.410 --> 13:46.370
And an artist has to keep moving.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.240
And if you don't agree with me,
l don't care!

13:49.290 --> 13:51.960
Miley, l'm sorry,
but this is a really bad idea.

13:52.010 --> 13:54.000
A bad, scary idea.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.010
Honey, l don't wanna tell you
what to do, but just...

13:56.050 --> 13:57.160
Then don't!

13:57.210 --> 14:00.330
l know what l am doing and
l am gonna prove it to you tomorrow.

14:00.370 --> 14:05.160
The next Hannah is going to blow the
roof off of the Sunshine Girls Benefit.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.200
Sweet niblets.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.240
l'm going to have to buy myself
a truckload of Sunshine Girl cookies

14:11.290 --> 14:13.250
to get myself out of this one.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.920
Well, that was the best day ever.

14:22.970 --> 14:25.690
Here you go, Rover.
Who's a good boy?

14:26.210 --> 14:28.330
What is wrong with you?

14:29.170 --> 14:32.450
Couldn't you find something better
to do with your day?

14:32.490 --> 14:33.600
You know, the next time you're bored,

14:33.650 --> 14:37.320
why don't you go hang out
with your friends or something?

14:37.770 --> 14:41.280
Wait a minute.
You don't have any friends, do you?

14:41.330 --> 14:45.450
Hey, l got plenty of friends. There's...

14:46.410 --> 14:48.240
No, he's suing me.

14:49.450 --> 14:52.200
Okay, but... But there's...

14:52.890 --> 14:55.010
No, l'm suing him.

14:56.690 --> 15:00.240
l'm really good friends
with my brother, Mateo.

15:00.290 --> 15:04.410
Well, we will be
if he ever agrees to settle out of court.

15:04.450 --> 15:06.880
You know, Rico,
maybe if you were just nice to people

15:06.930 --> 15:08.760
instead of making them
dance like a monkey,

15:08.810 --> 15:12.040
people would actually
want to hang out with you.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.400
-Wait.
-What?

15:14.450 --> 15:18.600
You're right.
l shouldn't have made you do all that.

15:18.650 --> 15:22.640
lt's just making friends isn't something
l'm good at.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.400
Well, gee, l wonder why.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.970
l think it's because
the world is full of idiots.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.720
My mom says it's my attitude.

15:32.770 --> 15:33.800
ldiot.

15:34.930 --> 15:37.970
Look, Rico, did you ever think that
maybe if you treated me a little better,

15:38.010 --> 15:39.360
l'd be your friend?

15:39.410 --> 15:42.160
Well, l was hoping
for a higher-class friend, but...

15:42.210 --> 15:43.880
Rico.

15:43.930 --> 15:47.970
Right. You'll really be my friend?
No catch?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.000
Or condition.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.040
So, you want to go back to my house

15:53.090 --> 15:55.080
and pay my brother
to dance like a monkey?

15:55.130 --> 15:56.450
Rico.

15:57.610 --> 15:58.960
Fine.

16:00.050 --> 16:02.440
-Want to go see a movie?
-Sure.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.090
Hey, you want me
to wrap you up like a baby,

16:05.130 --> 16:06.640
so you can get in for free?

16:06.690 --> 16:10.680
Jackson, this could be
the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

16:16.810 --> 16:21.120
Nobody understands.
An artist has to grow.

16:21.850 --> 16:26.480
<i>Whee doggies</i>!
<i>Howdy, l'm Robby Ray. Let's kick it</i>.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.080
Yeah, we'll kick it, all right.

16:32.810 --> 16:34.770
Anti-Hannah style.

16:34.810 --> 16:38.720
Yeah, you're gonna see
tomorrow, buddy. You just...

16:38.770 --> 16:40.730
l'm talking to a doll.

16:42.290 --> 16:44.440
Yeah.
The new Hannah's going to sleep,

16:44.490 --> 16:48.720
and she ain't going to brush her teeth
because l'm bad to the bone.

16:55.130 --> 16:57.170
l'm bad to the bone.

17:01.490 --> 17:03.800
l'm so excited,
and l know you all are, too,

17:03.850 --> 17:06.359
so let's give a warm Sunshine welcome

17:06.410 --> 17:08.800
to the Sunshine Girls'
Role Model of the Year,

17:08.849 --> 17:11.200
Miss Hannah Montana!

17:27.089 --> 17:31.610
<i>Well, l used to be a nice gir</i> l
<i>Always doing what l'm tol</i> d

17:31.650 --> 17:36.480
<i>And l'm here to tell you, bab</i> y
<i>That it's getting kind of ol</i> d

17:38.250 --> 17:43.080
<i>So say goodbye to all the sparkle</i> s
<i>And all the pretty girly lac</i> e

17:43.130 --> 17:48.200
<i>l'm gonna chew your little heart u</i> p
<i>And then l'll spit it in your fac</i> e

17:50.370 --> 17:54.600
<i>l don't trust nobod</i> y
<i>Parents, teachers or the school</i> s

17:54.650 --> 17:59.330
<i>Gonna do just what l want t</i> o
<i>Gonna break down all the rule</i> s

17:59.370 --> 18:03.680
<i>Gonna break down all the rules no</i> w
<i>Gonna break down all the rule</i> s

18:03.730 --> 18:06.000
<i>l'm gonna break dow</i> n
<i>all the rules no</i> w

18:06.050 --> 18:08.400
<i>Gonna stick it to those fool</i> s

18:15.970 --> 18:20.040
Stop! Stop. Wait, wait, wait, you guys!
lt's just a song!

18:20.090 --> 18:22.480
Stop! Stop it. lt's just a song.

18:22.530 --> 18:24.280
l didn't mean it!

18:25.530 --> 18:29.520
Stop! Put your parents down!

18:33.530 --> 18:36.170
Wait, wait, wait.
Remember the old Hannah?

18:36.210 --> 18:39.330
<i>You're a true frien</i> d

18:39.370 --> 18:40.800
<i>You're here till the en</i> d

18:40.850 --> 18:42.410
<i>Sing with me</i>.

18:45.530 --> 18:48.840
<i>Guys! Guys, seriously, stop</i>!

18:48.890 --> 18:51.800
<i>Someone is going to get hurt</i>!

18:54.090 --> 18:56.000
Daddy, help me!

18:56.530 --> 18:58.880
l'm a little tied up right now.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.040
Great song, though! Great song!

19:03.050 --> 19:05.640
Yo, Tarzana! Put me down!

19:05.690 --> 19:08.040
Not like that!

19:12.610 --> 19:14.360
What's going on?

19:15.170 --> 19:18.240
-You okay?
-Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

19:19.130 --> 19:22.330
What were you going to do,
raccoon them to smithereens?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.170
l just grabbed
what was on the nightstand.

19:25.210 --> 19:28.250
You have an angry raccoon
on your nightstand?

19:28.690 --> 19:31.040
Honey, Buster's also a light.

19:34.650 --> 19:36.610
l just got him yesterday.

19:36.650 --> 19:40.240
l don't know how people decorated
before the lnternet.

19:40.850 --> 19:45.720
l don't know what's scarier, my dream
or the fact that you paid for that thing.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.200
Well, l'll tell you the truth, honey,

19:48.250 --> 19:51.400
if you want to talk about it,
if you're still mad at me,

19:51.450 --> 19:53.760
Buster's a heck of a listener.

19:56.130 --> 19:57.720
You were right.

19:58.210 --> 20:00.850
l don't want to be
a hard-edged Hannah.

20:00.890 --> 20:04.040
That's not the kind of message
l want to send to my fans.

20:04.090 --> 20:06.650
But what about
keeping your audience interested?

20:06.690 --> 20:10.600
There's got to be a way
to keep them interested and still be me.

20:10.650 --> 20:13.960
Sure, lsis can change who she is
all the time,

20:14.010 --> 20:16.920
but l like who l am,
and l'm not going to change

20:16.970 --> 20:20.480
just to hold on to an audience
that hasn't even left me yet.

20:20.530 --> 20:25.000
Well, as long as you're true to yourself,
your fans will always be there.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.810
l hope you're right.

20:28.650 --> 20:32.850
Now, go ahead,
tell me how wrong l was. Bring it on.

20:34.490 --> 20:38.080
l'd love to, but the truth is,
l was the one that was wrong.

20:38.810 --> 20:41.560
Raccoon-swinging daddy say what?

20:41.610 --> 20:46.130
Yeah, as an artist, you've got
to have the freedom to explore.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.290
l wasn't giving you that.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.810
Thanks, Daddy.

20:50.850 --> 20:55.210
How am l ever going to become
an angry, misunderstood teenager

20:55.250 --> 20:57.240
with a daddy like you?

20:58.370 --> 21:01.010
l heard shouting! What's going on?

21:02.170 --> 21:04.730
Why does everyone
have a light-up critter but me?

21:04.770 --> 21:06.570
No, Dave doesn't light up.

21:06.610 --> 21:08.760
He's a pencil sharpener.
You just lift his tail and...

21:08.810 --> 21:10.960
l don't need to see that.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.330
l never grow tired of you.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.880
Dahli!

21:20.010 --> 21:23.050
Hannah!
Darling, what are you doing here?

21:23.090 --> 21:25.400
l just came by
to cancel my new Hannah look.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.970
l won't be needing the torn fishnets,
the combat boots or the bullwhip.

21:31.010 --> 21:32.570
On second thought,
send me that bullwhip.

21:32.610 --> 21:34.800
l could use that on my brother.

21:34.850 --> 21:37.600
Yes, yes, of course. Well, bye-bye.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.720
l see. lsis is here.

21:49.650 --> 21:52.450
Little slow on the draw there, partner.

21:53.850 --> 21:56.360
Dahliano, l love my new look!

22:01.210 --> 22:02.640
Awkward.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.490
This is your next-next?

22:07.570 --> 22:10.080
Well, it seems to work for you.

22:11.930 --> 22:16.450
Yo, Dahli, on second thought,
give me that bullwhip now.

22:17.410 --> 22:20.610
Yeah, that's right, honey,
you'd better back off.
