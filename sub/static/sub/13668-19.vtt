WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:02.000
What's wrong with her?

00:02.000 --> 00:02.760
What's wrong with her?

00:02.760 --> 00:04.680
What's wrong with her?

00:04.680 --> 00:07.080
That's the sort of bump
I want put in it.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.200
Usually, people want bumps taken out.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.240
Doesn't she have
a perfect nose already?

00:11.240 --> 00:12.520
Don't start, Victor.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.680
I don't feel old,
so why should I act it?

00:14.680 --> 00:16.480
You have to rethink this.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.320
You have to live
with Harriet and me.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.520
I'd rather die.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.960
And I cut it, and I cut it,
and I cut it!

00:21.960 --> 00:24.400
Stay away from me,
I know what I'm doing!

00:24.400 --> 00:26.040
Pete and I might have hepatitis.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.480
Drop 'em.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.480
Ah!

02:15.680 --> 02:17.040
I've had it with her.  Who?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.800
Your patient. Evelyn Milbourne.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.880
Really? I'm surprised. I've been
her doctor since Harwood died,

02:21.880 --> 02:23.640
she hasn't given me trouble.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.000
Well...

02:25.000 --> 02:26.840
You asked me to see her
in the morning.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.760
I take time out from a busy
schedule to do you a favour.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.960
Yes, I appreciate it.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.680
Whenever I try to explain
how delicate her condition is,

02:33.680 --> 02:36.880
she makes fun of me.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.880
I don't like being mimicked.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.880
Now, I have finally decided what
I want my new nose to look like.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.600
That's the sort of bump
I want put in it.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.240
You know, usually people
want bumps taken out.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.320
Good morning.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.280
Good morning, Donald,
what can I do for you?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.320
&lt; Mrs Milbourne,

02:59.320 --> 03:00.880
I have to be
in surgery in 15 minutes,

03:00.880 --> 03:02.960
so maybe you could be
a little more cooperative?

03:02.960 --> 03:06.480
"Mrs Milbourne, I have to be
in surgery in 15 minutes."

03:06.480 --> 03:08.240
See what I mean?

03:08.240 --> 03:11.120
Evelyn, I think you should listen
to what Dr Craig has to say.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.800
Well, all right,
with you here to translate.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.520
Her PVCs and atrial fibrillation
responded to medication.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.240
However, there is a good chance
of stenosis

03:21.240 --> 03:23.600
in the left anterior
descending artery.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.720
If you look here,

03:25.720 --> 03:29.720
her EKGs show Q waves
in leads two, three, V1 and V2.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.480
Translate?

03:32.480 --> 03:35.200
Well, we think that when you fell
and broke her hip,

03:35.200 --> 03:36.840
you might have had a heart attack.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.760
I didn't have any chest pains,
it must have been a very slight one.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.160
There's no such thing
as a slight heart attack.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.680
A broken hip that is mending poorly
and a heart that is threatening -

03:45.680 --> 03:47.680
it's nothing to smile at.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.520
Or to laugh at either.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.960
I'm not laughing at my heart,
I'm laughing at you.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.440
What do you mean?

03:54.440 --> 03:56.600
Do you ever talk to yourself
in the mirror?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.720
Sane people don't talk
to themselves in mirrors.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.880
Try it.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.280
Look in the mirror and pretend
you're talking to me

04:02.280 --> 04:05.560
on the other side.
And watch how you hold your head

04:05.560 --> 04:07.000
and how you purse your lips

04:07.000 --> 04:09.920
as though everything
that you say is a jewel.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.440
Try it, you'll laugh.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.200
Medicine is a serious business,
and I'm due in surgery.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.320
Evelyn,
you have to be nice to our doctors.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.960
Well, I told you, I don't want
to see any doctor but you.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.800
Besides, I hate hospitals.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.280
Who doesn't? All right,
I'll check in on you later.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.480
Try to behave.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.000
No.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.880
Fine, but what I think you should do
is wait for Dr Weinberg

04:33.880 --> 04:35.320
to get back from Caneel Bay.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.640
No, uh-uh, I'm not going to wait.
No.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.520
It's obvious to me that getting
a suntan is more important to him

04:40.520 --> 04:41.600
than doing my nose.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.160
I want the swelling to be down
before my son's graduation

04:44.160 --> 04:47.080
from Valley Forge Military Academy.
He is my only child.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.080
I want to look right, you know, for
the commencement, you understand?

04:50.080 --> 04:53.880
You can understand that, can't you?

04:53.880 --> 04:54.360
Sure.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.640
Sure.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.480
Then, we're on the schedule
for tomorrow.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.920
Oh, thanks so much.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.920
Bye.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.200
Excuse me,
may I borrow this magazine?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.880
Well, certainly, take it.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.760
You look awfully distinguished
to be in a ward,

05:15.760 --> 05:17.680
why aren't you in a private room?

05:17.680 --> 05:18.880
To save money.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.960
I thought so. Me, too.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.240
What are you in for?

05:22.240 --> 05:25.080
A broken hip
and myocardial infarction.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.800
I broke my hip once two years ago.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.600
You know I didn't even need a pin?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.680
It just healed by itself.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.120
My son had a poem in here once.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.640
That was quite a year.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.160
Poem in the Atlantic

05:37.160 --> 05:39.640
and valedictorian
of his graduating class at Harvard.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.880
My only child.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.560
You look very young to have
a son out of college.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.680
Oh?

05:44.680 --> 05:48.680
I married young, but thank you,
really, that's very kind of you.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.360
Wayne, you got a new cap.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.960
Alley of the good.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.880
You look like your old self again -
ridiculous.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.880
Hi, I'm Dr Fiscus,
what's your name?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.720
Do you know your name?

06:09.720 --> 06:11.880
Yes.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.480
Ma'am,
did your husband bring you in?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.520
Oh, I'm not married.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.400
Your chart says Mrs.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.600
I'm not married.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.640
Um... I'll be right back.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.400
'Mr Klein, utility room, Four West.
Mr Klein...'

06:27.400 --> 06:29.560
I'm Angelo, her husband.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.280
Can you tell me what happened?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.880
Well, I don't know. This morning
she left to go shopping,

06:33.880 --> 06:36.440
I was away on business
and the kids called hysterical

06:36.440 --> 06:38.160
because she hadn't come home.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.520
So, we all went looking for her,
and a little while ago,

06:40.520 --> 06:42.560
the police said
they had brought her here.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.400
Does she have a history
of heavy drinking?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.600
Does she have a history
of heavy drinking?

06:45.600 --> 06:49.600
She forgets her name, her car keys,
she forgets the kids' names.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.280
Last week she told me
I ruined her life.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.280
Another time, she stopped
in the middle of dinner

06:56.280 --> 06:58.800
and she stared at me
and the kids and said,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.880
"Every night, it's more strangers."

07:01.880 --> 07:03.200
Is she taking any medication?

07:03.200 --> 07:03.960
No.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.000
No.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.040
Doctor, you got to take her in.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.400
Doctor, you got to take her in.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.600
Headaches, visual disturbances?

07:10.600 --> 07:11.800
No. What's wrong with her?

07:11.800 --> 07:12.960
I don't know.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.720
&lt; Angelo.  What, honey?

07:14.720 --> 07:16.840
Angelo.  It's OK.

07:16.840 --> 07:17.880
I want to go home.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.400
Admit her, please.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.720
The doctor just wants
to take a few tests.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.960
The doctor just wants
to take a few tests.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.240
Don't worry about it.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.440
So, as usual, we had a fight
and I walked out.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.960
Mom said she didn't want to see me
again until I rinsed the blue out.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.480
I told her to rotate.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.080
Well, you are welcome to stay
at my house if you think it'll help.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.640
Thanks, Gram. We'll see.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.640
But, please, wear a hat when you're
out feeding the animals, will you?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.880
What has she got?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.560
I don't know.

07:47.560 --> 07:51.160
I don't stick my nose
in other people's business.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.240
Her name is Mrs Henriquez.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.040
Yeah.

07:55.040 --> 07:59.040
She has Eastern equine encephalitis.
It is very debilitating.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.640
Do me a favour, go home and do
the things that I asked, will you?

08:05.120 --> 08:06.160
Thank you, darling.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.320
And just being different,
don't forget,

08:08.320 --> 08:11.800
from your mother and father,
doesn't make you independent.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.800
I'll be back tomorrow, Gram.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.680
I think Dad is coming, too.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.040
Oh, that should be a treat.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.040
I can't wait to see the latest
spring fashions in mourning wear.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.800
I assume Harriet will be making
an appearance, too.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.200
Have no fear, we'll leave Mom home.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.640
Bye.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.520
Bye.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.039
Oh, I like her, Evelyn.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.559
Your granddaughter
is really special.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.440
How do you know my name?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.280
Well, I looked on your chart.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.280
And you live alone. Me, too.
I love it. What about you?

08:46.720 --> 08:48.800
Oh, not now, dear, I'm reading.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.320
What are you reading?

08:51.320 --> 08:54.520
What did you say you were in for?

08:54.520 --> 08:58.520
They're not sure yet.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.320
So, you get a three-dimensional
picture of my brain this way?  Uh-huh.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.840
You see, the CAT scan takes a series
of X-rays from different angles

09:05.840 --> 09:09.080
and the dye we injected into your
body helps give them contrast.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.600
What happens to the dye later?

09:10.600 --> 09:14.040
It just naturally passes
through your system.

09:14.040 --> 09:18.040
I know this thing looks terrible,
but it doesn't hurt at all.
See you in half an hour.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.400
How's it going?

09:41.400 --> 09:45.400
They're just starting.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.200
I was on my way to your office,
I had made an appointment.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.840
I know, but it felt like a walk.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.000
What's her problem?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.040
Well, for a while, Mrs Orso
was perfectly fine.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.560
She's logical, she's coherent.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.280
And then all of a sudden, she's off.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.560
I mean, she doesn't recognise
friends or relatives,

10:05.560 --> 10:06.880
sometimes not even herself.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.920
Head trauma?

10:07.920 --> 10:08.960
No.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.120
Spinal tap?

10:10.120 --> 10:11.840
Fluid's as clear as a bell.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.960
Has she been up to Psych?

10:12.960 --> 10:16.080
First day. I'm stumped.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.480
I was wondering if I can impose
on you to give her a look.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.680
I'd be glad to.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.800
But what about talking to Doc Simon?
He's our top neurologist.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.680
He's in New Haven on a consult.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.680
Blowing his own horn, no doubt.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.040
She's breathing funny.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.400
Don't you think her breathing
sounds funny?

10:39.400 --> 10:42.800
Well, I hadn't really noticed.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.520
There is an awful lot
of unnecessary surgery done.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.960
Doctors like to make profits.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.960
No, I mean surgery that the patient
wants that isn't life-threatening.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.920
Like, uh... Circumcision!

10:53.920 --> 10:57.520
Oh, but circumcision isn't really
the patient's choice, is it?

10:57.520 --> 11:00.480
I get the feeling sometimes
that you go on a little too long,

11:00.480 --> 11:02.080
Mrs Gallagher.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.600
Oh, please, just call me Paige.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.160
You must be tired.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.440
Yes. A lot of tests.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.280
Here we are.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.640
Thanks for the ride.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.640
This is for the bed and this button
buzzes out to the nurses' station.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.040
Now, if you want nobody to bother
you for 20 minutes, push it.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.720
Thank you.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.000
And the bathroom
is right over there.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Thank you.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.760
Hi.

11:30.760 --> 11:34.760
Hello.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.320
Time for lights out, everybody.

11:39.320 --> 11:43.320
You can keep your overheads
on to read, if you like. Good night.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.800
Well, sweet dreams, ladies.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.240
My, I feel like I'm back
in summer camp.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.160
When are they going to blow Taps?

11:53.160 --> 11:54.600
Good night, Mrs Gallagher.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.080
Nighty-night.

11:57.080 --> 12:01.080
HEAVY BREATHING

12:01.400 --> 12:04.200
What's wrong with her?

12:04.200 --> 12:08.200
Mrs Henriquez.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.680
Mrs Henriquez.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.640
Stop shaking her and call the nurse.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.920
Oh.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.320
Oh. Oh, God.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.360
Oh, God.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.640
Hurry! Hurry!

12:22.640 --> 12:24.280
Do something.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.640
Go back to bed.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.120
Right now!

12:27.120 --> 12:28.600
We were just trying to help.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.920
Code blue, room 4202.
Code blue 4202.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.920
The best you can do
is go back to bed.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.960
It's probably nothing.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.960
What's with all those machines?

12:44.240 --> 12:46.120
OK, what's the story?

12:46.120 --> 12:49.880
She's been in a coma for three
weeks and is on nasal oxygen now.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.680
OK, give me a 23 ET tube
and a curved scope.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.520
Last week, she developed a urinary
tract infection and a septicaemia.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.200
BP 60, palp.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.520
OK, just open the IV
according to the chart.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.400
The patient is "do not resuscitate".

13:03.400 --> 13:05.560
Shouldn't somebody call her family?

13:05.560 --> 13:09.000
OK, that is it.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.600
Are you Mrs Henriquez's physician?

13:10.600 --> 13:13.360
No, I never saw her before just now.
Velasco is the attendee?

13:13.360 --> 13:17.360
Uh-huh.  Ok.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.200
You'll want to notify the family.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.400
Not me.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.520
Right.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.600
Are they going to leave her here
all night?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.600
Oh, I'm sure someone will come by.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.400
Of course.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.840
Well, good night.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.240
Good night.

13:33.240 --> 13:37.160
Sweet dreams.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.080
By the way, my name is Rose.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.080
Ah.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.400
I just couldn't take
any more from Mom,

13:48.400 --> 13:52.200
so last night I packed up
and moved over to your place.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.240
&lt; Wish me luck.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.840
What have they got planned for you
this time, the rack?

13:55.840 --> 13:56.880
No.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.400
It is called an EEG, am I right?

13:59.400 --> 14:00.800
It sounds expensive.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.800
I've gone this far.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.000
Hello, Mother.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.680
I got these from that little man
on Milk Street,

14:11.680 --> 14:14.480
where Father used to buy you flowers.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.720
Jennifer.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.200
Hi, Dad. Is Mom coming, too?

14:19.200 --> 14:22.600
No, she, um, had an appointment
she couldn't break.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.080
I'll bet.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.800
How come you're not at school
at 9.30 on a weekday morning?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.480
I'm on my way, OK?

14:29.480 --> 14:31.880
I just stopped by to see Gram
and tell her I fed Toby.

14:31.880 --> 14:32.920
You've got to learn,

14:32.920 --> 14:35.120
when things are not going the way
you want at home,

14:35.120 --> 14:38.720
the solution is not
running off to Grandma.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
Fine.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.840
And call your mother.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.960
Let her know you're still on Earth.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.960
I can't believe the way that you
and Harriet are raising Jenny.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.800
You keep out of it, Mother.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.800
Well, I can't for the life of me
understand why you won't allow her

14:56.960 --> 14:58.600
to express her individuality,

14:58.600 --> 15:01.160
let her become
what she's going to become.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.680
I know you don't approve
of the way we live our lives.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.080
That's all right, you've never
approved of the way I live my life.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.840
(LAUGHS)

15:08.840 --> 15:12.840
Well, at least you can still laugh.

15:12.840 --> 15:16.680
I had a long conversation with
Dr Westphall yesterday afternoon.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.320
You had a heart attack.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.360
How could you have a heart attack
and not mention it to me?

15:22.360 --> 15:25.360
Sometimes I find your behaviour
absolutely astounding.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.720
I was going to tell you today.
I had a heart attack.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.520
There, I told you.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.440
Do you feel more included?

15:32.440 --> 15:35.000
Your condition is far more serious
than you pretend.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Apparently, it's too dangerous
for you to live alone any more.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.640
Really?  Yes, really.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.960
Well, what do you suggest?

15:43.960 --> 15:45.240
It's obvious, isn't it?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.640
You have to come live
with Harriet and me.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.480
I'd rather die.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.360
Would you rather go to
a retirement home?

15:51.360 --> 15:53.080
I'm not going anywhere.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.680
Least of all to your house
to live with you and Harriet.

15:56.680 --> 16:00.360
This isn't...going well.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.560
No, it isn't.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.480
I guess I should be...
Going.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.040
Thanks for the flowers.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.960
Don't let the door hit
you on your way out.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.520
I'll come see you tomorrow.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.520
Uh-huh.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.680
I find it hard to believe
that he's your son.

16:26.680 --> 16:30.600
So do I.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.600
Yep, spring is finally here.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.600
Yeah.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.520
Oh, did you and Dad get the...
get the pictures I sent you?

16:38.520 --> 16:40.000
Yeah?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.600
Weren't they great?

16:42.600 --> 16:43.840
Of course I took them.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.040
Well, David is right,
I had a great time.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.040
Yes, I got a parking ticket.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.120
Could you transfer me, please?

16:50.120 --> 16:52.720
You couldn't take this phone?
Thank you.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.240
Wait, what do you mean?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.440
Yes, I'm a doctor.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.000
Are they sure it is hepatitis?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.600
I got a parking ticket
while I was in an emergency.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.840
Which type?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.320
Yeah, 11052.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.760
Did Dr Fogel take it
while he was here?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.160
Fiscus says this works every time.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.680
If he did, that means
that Pete and I have hepatitis.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.400
What are you talking about?
You've got hep?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.119
Are you crazy?

17:15.119 --> 17:17.079
Incubation period is anywhere
from 15 to 45 days.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.400
Incubation period is anywhere
from 15 to 45 days.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.040
Yeah. No, that wasn't the emergency.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.720
If you're feeling lousy lately,
that would account for it.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.800
Never mind, OK?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.240
I can't get sick now, I got
the national boards coming up.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.200
Tell David I'll try and call him.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.200
I love you, too.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.880
Dr Westphall.  Uh-huh.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.920
Do you have a minute?

17:42.920 --> 17:45.320
I'm late for a lecture,
do you mind walking along with me?

17:45.320 --> 17:47.080
Not at all.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.920
You've got to help me.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.000
You told me she'd be able
to check out tomorrow.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.160
Where is she going to go?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.520
She's not willing to make
any compromises

17:54.520 --> 17:55.200
about her living arrangements?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.400
about her living arrangements?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.120
Mother and I have never really
gotten along.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.920
She is my mother and I love her,
despite the fact that

18:01.920 --> 18:04.640
if she moves in with us,
it will be a nightmare.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.600
I just want to know that she...
she's being taken care of.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.000
Do you want me to see what I can do?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I would appreciate that,
Dr Westphall. Thank you.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.760
Don't thank me yet, I don't think
my talking to her is going to make

18:15.760 --> 18:17.960
much of a difference anyway.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.840
Excuse me.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.960
17 down.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.000
Morocco.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.120
Ah.  Uh-huh.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.160
I do crosswords in pen,

18:26.160 --> 18:28.720
do I look like someone
who needs help?

18:28.720 --> 18:31.240
Yes. Come on, try me.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.440
All right.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.920
23 across, eight letters,

18:35.920 --> 18:37.440
plastic silverware.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.480
Oh, oxymoron.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.480
Yeah, a rhetorical figure in which
contradictory terms are combined.

18:44.520 --> 18:48.520
10 across, a named gadget
or trinket, six letters.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.680
Quawor.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.000
How do you spell that?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.800
Q, U, A, W, O, R.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.800
Yeah, that's what the aboriginal
tribes of Borneo used for barter.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.400
Oh, my, that is a scary place,
Borneo.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.000
Yeah, I lost a lot more there
than travellers cheques.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.040
Are you certain?

19:07.040 --> 19:09.760
Yes. Mm-hm.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.760
But then again, I might be reaching.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I wish Dr Carlisle was here, she's
given him all his other shots.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.640
Relax, it will be over in a minute.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.120
He had a real bad reaction
to his second DPT shot.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.480
I would do it myself, but...

19:25.480 --> 19:26.520
Forget it,

19:26.520 --> 19:29.440
you don't want to be the bad guy.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.320
You know how to squeeze the muscle,
instead of pinching the skin?

19:32.320 --> 19:34.080
Jack, do you want to wait outside?

19:34.080 --> 19:37.200
No. No, no, no.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.360
0.25ml, right?

19:39.360 --> 19:40.680
How are you feeling?

19:40.680 --> 19:41.760
I'm fine.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.840
With the national boards
coming up next month,

19:43.840 --> 19:47.840
this would be a hell of a time
to come down with anything.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.600
Everything all right?

19:49.600 --> 19:52.480
Serum immune globulin shot.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.200
My brother who stayed with us
just came down with hepatitis.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.240
Infectious?

19:56.240 --> 19:57.960
According to the doctors in Seattle.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.200
Pete and I got tested,
we'll have the results today.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.120
How are you feeling?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.240
How are you feeling?

20:02.240 --> 20:05.720
Just give me a little warning,
I'll try and distract him.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.520
It's over.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.640
What?

20:08.640 --> 20:12.240
That's it, button him up.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.080
What a trooper!

20:14.080 --> 20:15.520
You're next.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.120
Jack, I'll need a list
of all the patients you've treated

20:18.120 --> 20:20.200
since you came in contact
with your brother.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.480
I don't have any symptoms.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.680
Just in case. You should notify
your friends, too.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.840
Give them the option of having
a shot now or later.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.400
Dr Westphall, should we inoculate
the rest of the staff?

20:28.400 --> 20:32.400
Yep, I'll get that started.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.800
Drop 'em.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.200
I don't believe this.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.400
Ah!

20:51.400 --> 20:55.360
(CRIES)

20:55.360 --> 20:59.080
The worst part is,
Angelo encourages him.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.200
Is that vanilla
or butterscotch pudding?

21:01.200 --> 21:04.880
Naturally, he doesn't want to study.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.480
His father has convinced him
he has a million-dollar career

21:07.480 --> 21:08.680
kicking a football.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.480
I don't know, I don't know.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.000
He won't listen to me.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.840
Didn't you get pudding?

21:14.840 --> 21:18.400
No, I didn't. Peach cobbler.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.480
I am so hungry,
can I have just a little taste?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.680
Now, now, no food before surgery.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.880
I know, I know.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.480
I went through the same thing
with my son in grade school.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.240
He's in high school now, you now.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.000
I thought you said your son
had graduated Harvard.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.520
What?

21:32.520 --> 21:36.520
Yes. Don't you remember? Last night,
you said your son was valedictorian

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
of his Harvard graduating class.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.640
Oh, did I say that? You know,

21:40.640 --> 21:44.480
I am always doing that. Lord,
what I meant was my sister's son.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.600
You see, he's like my son.
Yes, Bradford.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.360
Was he or wasn't he valedictorian?

21:48.360 --> 21:50.480
What are you talking about?

21:50.480 --> 21:53.160
I think we got off the track somehow.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.640
Now that I think of it,

21:54.640 --> 21:56.920
the nurses keep on calling you
Miss Gallagher.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.240
Who is that?

21:59.240 --> 22:00.760
What are we talking about here?

22:00.760 --> 22:01.960
Rose, are you all right?

22:01.960 --> 22:03.920
Oh, I'm fine.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.920
I'm fine, I just forgot
what I was about to say.

22:06.920 --> 22:10.880
I'll remember it, but I forgot
what I was about to say.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.880
My God!

22:15.000 --> 22:17.760
I smell a dog.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.760
Do you smell a dog?

22:23.520 --> 22:26.920
Oh, I remember what
I was going to say.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.920
Five years ago, I had long hair,
very long hair,

22:31.080 --> 22:33.720
it was very beautiful.
And I decided to cut it,

22:33.720 --> 22:37.720
because one day I woke up
and I could hardly hold my head up.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.200
My husband, he didn't like the idea,
my kids, they went crazy.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.640
They screamed and they cried, but...

22:43.640 --> 22:47.440
My husband thought
it was a work of art.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.760
But it was very heavy for me,
so I cut it.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.520
I'm the only one
that didn't miss it.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.480
When I cut it,
I felt as light as a kite.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.880
Rose, what you doing?

22:57.880 --> 22:59.160
I know what I need to do.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.920
Don't come near me,
I know what I'm doing.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.920
I took my hair and I took it to
the side, and I started to cut it.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.520
And I cut it and I cut it!

23:07.520 --> 23:09.240
And I cut it!

23:09.240 --> 23:10.480
Rose, dear, we're friends.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.320
We're not friends!
I don't even know who you are!

23:13.320 --> 23:15.240
You can't tell me what to do!

23:15.240 --> 23:17.480
And I cut it and I cut it.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.840
You stay away from me,
I know what I'm doing!

23:19.840 --> 23:22.880
And I cut it and cut it
until I was done.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.880
That's it!

23:42.240 --> 23:46.240
Leave me alone.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.480
How are you feeling, Jack?

23:50.480 --> 23:51.640
Mm.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.640
Pete's doing great.
I just took his temperature, 98.5.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.080
100.6.  Uh-oh.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.120
Oh, for crying out loud,
and get out of here.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.720
Do you know someone you could leave
him with for a night?

24:02.720 --> 24:05.240
Pete's never been away
from me overnight.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.920
Well, just till you get
a handle on this thing.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.000
I'd love to take him,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.520
but my sister and brother-in-law
are in from Oneonta.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.040
I've got my hands full
with Tony and Elizabeth.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.920
I've got my hands full
with Tony and Elizabeth.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.320
Oh, all right, I'll take him.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.600
Not this second!

24:21.600 --> 24:23.280
I can't drag him along on rounds.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.200
Susie in Accounting
watches him for me.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.160
Yeah, well, dump him down there.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.880
Not you!

24:28.880 --> 24:32.640
Would you go home, Morrison?
You're ruining everyone's day.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.200
Hey, see you later, sport.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.560
I love you. I'm going now.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.400
See you later. OK?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.680
Jack, you are not putting him
up for adoption, just go.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.040
His food and things are in here,
in the baby bag.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.120
We'll manage.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.200
OK, thank you.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.600
Pete will be fine, Jack.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.480
All right. I'll call you later.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.840
BEEP

24:50.840 --> 24:52.120
Uh, Mr Glover again.

24:52.120 --> 24:56.120
Dr Craig, you know where
Accounting is, don't you?

24:56.640 --> 25:00.120
Don't forget to get your shot.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.360
Well, this is turning
into a hell of a day.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.160
Judy, 1% lidocaine
with epinephrine, please.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.160
Thank you.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.880
Victor.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.880
Sorry.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.360
Nasal speculum.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.040
Mind if I ask a question?

25:32.040 --> 25:34.280
I mean, I don't mean to sound
like a dolt or anything,

25:34.280 --> 25:37.360
but doesn't she have, like,
the perfect nose already?

25:37.360 --> 25:41.360
Look, the septum is deviated
25 degrees to the right.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.120
Big deal, who's going to be
looking inside her nose?

25:44.120 --> 25:46.560
Please don't start, Victor.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.880
Talk about a hooter.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.960
What's her name?
Marcy Pinover, there was a nose.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.640
So big she could pop balloons.
It was always running.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.120
Remember what happened
the last time you assisted me?

25:55.120 --> 25:56.160
Remember what happened
the last time you assisted me?

25:56.160 --> 25:58.400
I really don't want to throw you
out of the OR again.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.680
Fine, I'm done.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.680
Periosteal elevator.

26:03.960 --> 26:07.960
I'm done.

26:08.480 --> 26:12.480
I will be creating a small elevation
in the septal cartilage.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.400
Janie Havemyre, there was a nose!

26:14.400 --> 26:18.400
Talk about big. Find my car keys
and we'll drive out.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.680
I'll just... I'll go outside

26:24.680 --> 26:27.040
and I'll be out there a minute,
then I'll be done.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.080
&lt; Step in.

26:30.080 --> 26:34.080
Knife.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.280
Your progress is remarkable.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.600
I'll be ready for the marathon.

26:45.600 --> 26:49.600
85 years, step after step,
always on my own.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.960
I plan on leaving
this hospital that way.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.960
So, my son came to cry
on your shoulder, eh?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.360
Evelyn, I think moving in
is a good idea.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.960
It might not be the best of
all possible worlds, but still...

27:02.960 --> 27:05.320
I enjoy living alone.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.280
I want to listen
to my own thoughts in the morning,

27:08.280 --> 27:10.960
not someone flashing
in the next bathroom.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.960
I want to walk out
on my own back porch and watch

27:15.200 --> 27:18.320
the animals in the yard eating
the food that I leave for them.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.320
You need someone to help out.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.360
You need someone to help out.

27:20.360 --> 27:24.360
Now, you listen to me. Since I
first examined you four years ago,

27:25.200 --> 27:29.080
the sight in the right eye
has gone from 2060 to 2200.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.320
You have developed degenerative
arthritis in both your hips.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.880
You are recovering from a broken hip

27:33.880 --> 27:36.480
and you have experienced
irregularities in your heartbeat.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.200
Well, I don't believe in charts,
I believe in feelings,

27:40.200 --> 27:42.920
and I don't feel old,
so why should I act it?

27:42.920 --> 27:44.880
You have to rethink this, Evelyn.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.880
My best friend, Ana,
was put in a nursing home.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.080
I went to visit her once,
I never went back.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.280
I didn't like what she had become.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.280
No. She was alive,
but she was without hope.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.840
I don't care that life is easier
if it means giving up.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.880
I love my home.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.880
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.080
I wish we could be more conclusive.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.680
The only way is with a brain biopsy,
and that is rarely done.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.320
It's just that...

28:28.320 --> 28:31.720
She's not a whole lot older than me.

28:31.720 --> 28:35.280
This is your patient, Wayne, I won't
say anything unless I have to.

28:35.280 --> 28:39.240
Yes, sir.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.040
Mr Orso. This is Dr Auschlander.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.160
He's been helping me
with your wife's diagnosis.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.000
Hi. You found something?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.600
Let's talk in there.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.600
Stay right here.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.680
All of Mrs Orso's symptoms

29:02.680 --> 29:05.160
and tests indicate
a progressive dementia,

29:05.160 --> 29:09.160
often confused with senility.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.560
Your wife has Alzheimer's disease.

29:15.560 --> 29:19.560
Yeah, and?

29:21.240 --> 29:24.680
There is an excessive loss
of brain cells.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.360
Her brain is dying at a much more
advanced rate than her body.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.760
But Rose is so energetic,
she's only 41 years old.

29:30.760 --> 29:34.760
I mean, how could...?

29:35.040 --> 29:37.200
Just like that?
She got it just like that?

29:37.200 --> 29:40.840
It's possible it's been
going on for some time.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.400
But she has been able
to cover it up till now.

29:43.400 --> 29:46.240
Why would she...?

29:46.240 --> 29:47.600
What's going to happen to her?

29:47.600 --> 29:48.960
That's hard to say.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.800
Try. Because to me,
one and one equals two,

29:50.800 --> 29:54.800
and I've got to know
what'll happen.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.840
She won't get any better.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.120
Over the next three to five years,

30:00.120 --> 30:04.040
her mental condition
will continue deteriorating.

30:04.040 --> 30:08.040
She'll become incapable of being
able to take care of you...

30:08.560 --> 30:10.440
..and the children.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.680
And eventually,

30:12.680 --> 30:16.680
incapable of taking care of herself.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.640
There is a lot of research going on,
no cure, at least not yet.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.480
I'm sorry.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.480
Come on, honey, take it like a man.

30:46.480 --> 30:49.040
That's easy enough for you to say.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.440
Oh. I broke my hip and now this.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.480
You come into a hospital
with one thing

30:54.480 --> 30:58.480
and then you limp out with another.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.160
When I was in the Peace Corps,
I inoculated hundreds of natives,

31:02.160 --> 31:05.520
I know it hurts like hell.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.240
You're so doped up from your
operation, you won't feel a thing.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.080
Ow! Oh.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.560
Do you want to bet?

31:12.560 --> 31:16.560
Oh.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.960
Be right out, kiddo.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.960
Smart girl, you got yourself put in
restraints to avoid getting stabbed.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.200
No, practising hairstyling
without a license.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.920
They thought I'd hurt myself.
What are you going to do?

31:33.920 --> 31:35.440
I'm going to give you the shot.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.040
Oh.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.440
Ow.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.600
Oh, that hurts.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.600
I'm sorry I can't undo
the restraints.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.880
Stupid. &gt;

31:57.880 --> 31:59.800
I mean, this is really stupid. &gt;

31:59.800 --> 32:01.480
No, no. I don't know if you should.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.000
Maybe I am crazy, Paige.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
We won't let anything happen to you
this time, promise.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.840
I'm sorry I ruined lunch.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.840
Oh, don't worry, they'd already
ruined that in the kitchen.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.040
I don't know what comes over me.

32:18.040 --> 32:22.040
My mind goes to an empty
and horrible place.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.400
And every time it does,

32:24.400 --> 32:28.400
I become more and more of a stranger
than who I really am.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.920
I love my family so much.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.920
I'm really afraid I'm going
to lose them.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.240
I've got such wonderful memories,

32:38.240 --> 32:42.240
and I think I'm going to lose them,
too.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.160
I don't want to hurt myself,
I don't want to hurt anybody else.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.040
Paige, please come back.

32:47.040 --> 32:50.200
Put them back.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.200
Yes.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.600
Is that too tight?

33:05.600 --> 33:09.600
No.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.640
Hi.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.920
How are you doing?

33:28.920 --> 33:31.840
Oh, a lot better than the last time
you looked in on me.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.000
Thanks for taking
off the restraints.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.040
Want some company?

33:36.040 --> 33:37.080
Yeah.

33:37.080 --> 33:41.080
Sure.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.720
So, I guess you got my test
back by now, huh?

33:54.720 --> 33:56.840
What's wrong with me?
Am I crazy?

33:56.840 --> 33:59.120
No, you're not going crazy.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.120
The tests indicate that the brain
tissue has been affected in some way.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.320
And I would like you to stay over.
I want to run a few more minor tests

34:07.320 --> 34:11.320
and explain to you a little better
what's happening.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.560
You a Red Sox fan?

34:15.560 --> 34:17.639
Inside and out.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.280
Me, too.

34:20.280 --> 34:24.280
You know, when I was little,
in the season of '51,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.440
that's when my dad started taking me
to Fenway.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.199
I used to measure the games
in terms of Italians.

34:30.199 --> 34:34.199
Yeah, I did.
Tom DiMaggio played centre for us.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.960
But his brother, the great Joey D
played for the Yankees.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.880
They also had Rizzuto, Raschi,

34:40.880 --> 34:43.239
and the great
Yogi Berra behind the plate.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.000
That was the thing.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
I think that is why they always had
the edge over us, better Italians.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.719
The Yankees always featured
outstanding Italians.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.440
Are you Italian?

34:56.440 --> 34:57.840
Lithuanian.

34:57.840 --> 35:01.720
Not too many legendary hardballers
come out of Lithuania.

35:01.720 --> 35:05.720
That's right.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.320
Oh, don't look at my hair.

35:10.320 --> 35:14.320
I'm so embarrassed.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.520
Enjoy the hat.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.680
Oh! Really?

35:26.680 --> 35:27.760
Really.

35:27.760 --> 35:31.160
Oh, thanks. Hey, do you know what?

35:31.160 --> 35:34.440
On Sunday,
the Yankees are playing at Fenway.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.920
A doubleheader!

35:35.920 --> 35:39.160
Maybe I'll see you there.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.160
Yeah.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.680
Have you spoken
with your mother yet?

35:45.680 --> 35:49.680
No. I don't feel like slam dancing
with Mom right now.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.520
Jenny, whenever you have fought
with your mother,

35:52.520 --> 35:54.480
I was glad to have you come
and live at my house.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.800
Oh, me too, Gram. I love it.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.800
Look, I've run out of options.
I'm getting old, I need help.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.440
Well, that's OK,
I'll take care of you.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.040
The two of us,
we can live at your place.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.720
Oh, you wouldn't be happy.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.360
How do you know?

36:10.360 --> 36:14.360
I've decided to sell my house
and try moving in with your parents.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.480
Why? What for?

36:18.480 --> 36:21.880
I've had plenty of time to think
lying on my back.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.560
I've spent my whole life
pushing people away

36:24.560 --> 36:26.840
in the name of independence.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.880
I don't regret it,
but I have realised that

36:28.880 --> 36:32.880
I've never allowed your father
or your mother to get close to me.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.440
I'm serious, Gram,
I can take care of you.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.240
I'm giving up my independence

36:38.240 --> 36:40.520
and you're at an age when
you're just getting yours.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.920
You can't be tied down
to taking care of me.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.320
I love you!

36:44.320 --> 36:48.280
Well, I love you, too.
But you're almost 18.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.520
You can move out and dye your hair
any colour you please,

36:51.520 --> 36:55.520
if that's what you want.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.920
Well, what do you think, huh?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.000
Do you want the truth?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.600
Of course.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.600
You look like Joe Frazier
after the Thrilla in Manila.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.280
Really?

37:14.280 --> 37:17.000
Well, I think you'll look great
when the swelling comes down.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.600
But between you, me
and the lamppost,

37:18.600 --> 37:21.800
I thought you were beautiful
before the operation.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.000
Oh, no. I hated my old nose.
It was a white-bread nose,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.240
the product of generations
of homogenisation.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.880
It lacked character!

37:28.880 --> 37:30.760
You take your nose, for instance.

37:30.760 --> 37:34.120
You see, that's a normal nose, but
it's conceived on an Italian face.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.840
Oh, yeah? Thanks a lot.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.040
Listen, that's a compliment!

37:38.040 --> 37:39.720
I have always wanted to be ethnic,

37:39.720 --> 37:41.760
to be Italian, or Jewish,
or something.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.840
Those people always have character.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.120
Nobody ever stood out in my family.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.400
How about your son,
the valedictorian?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.560
I don't have a son,
I don't have any children.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.440
You're kidding me.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.400
I don't even have a southern accent.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.800
You are kidding!

37:58.800 --> 38:00.400
I lied about everything.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.840
What the hell for?

38:01.840 --> 38:03.960
Because I'm a boring person!

38:03.960 --> 38:07.320
I don't have any character
so I thought that I would be one.

38:07.320 --> 38:10.360
But no more of that,
that's exhausting, you know?

38:10.360 --> 38:14.360
I mean, you get caught,
it turns people off.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.120
You know why I had this operation?
For my mental health.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.440
Yeah, I thought the nose
would give me character

38:20.440 --> 38:23.760
so I wouldn't have to be one.
Crazy, huh?

38:23.760 --> 38:27.760
Listen, I give you my solemn promise
I'm not lying any more. Uh-uh.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.920
You are hysterical.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.080
You made a choice to go nuts
and here I am, with no choice,

38:34.080 --> 38:38.080
going nuts. Two nuts.
In the same room.

38:38.680 --> 38:42.680
You make me laugh!

38:48.400 --> 38:52.400
'Dr Wolf.
Dr Michael Wolf to maternity.'

38:55.920 --> 38:57.280
Next. &gt;

38:57.280 --> 39:00.040
You better go before me,
I got to use the phone.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.600
I said next.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.080
Oh, Dr Cavanero, there must be
some mistake in my files

39:04.080 --> 39:06.200
cos I remember having
hepatitis in 1975.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.240
Luther.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.640
You see, I remember catching
it at my Uncle Nadel's wake.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.200
Just because you have had it once,

39:12.200 --> 39:14.440
doesn't mean you can't have
it again. Come on.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.200
I just don't like to waste medicine.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.000
Today, Luther! &gt;

39:19.000 --> 39:22.920
I'm not afraid.
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm a man.

39:22.920 --> 39:26.920
I mean, The Hawk is not afraid
of nothing.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.320
OK, Doc, hit me with your best shot.

39:33.320 --> 39:36.200
Oh!

39:36.200 --> 39:39.960
Angelo, sweetheart, I love you,
but we cannot afford a private room.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.480
I want you to have it.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.880
But I'm happy here.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.880
Dr Fiscus and the old guy said
what you need is privacy and quiet.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.440
Besides,
nothing is too good for you.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.720
Why do I have to move
in the middle of the night?

39:53.720 --> 39:54.920
Would you shush?

39:54.920 --> 39:58.920
You shush!

40:02.480 --> 40:04.720
Rose,
you don't have to make the bed,

40:04.720 --> 40:06.720
&lt; they have people here
who will do that.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.440
Please, Angelo, you know how I am,

40:08.440 --> 40:10.600
I like to leave things
the way I find them.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.200
Here comes the Angelo Orso express.
Come on, Rose.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.560
Come up and visit, huh?

40:16.560 --> 40:20.560
Paige.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.120
Listen,
thanks for our little talk, huh?

40:25.120 --> 40:29.120
Yeah.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.840
Evelyn, thanks.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.480
I have a feeling you're going
to outlast everybody here.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.400
Oh, I intend to, Rose, I intend to.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.760
OK.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.360
Bye-bye.  Goodbye, Rose.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.440
Drop us a line.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.440
Oh, I will, I will.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.600
My hat.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.920
Bye. Bye.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.320
(PETE CRIES)

41:06.320 --> 41:09.200
Ellen, it's your turn.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.200
Where do you get
this "your turn" baloney?

41:13.840 --> 41:15.240
When Stephen was a baby,

41:15.240 --> 41:18.360
I was the one that always got up
with him in the middle of the night.

41:18.360 --> 41:21.680
Oh, I love your selective memory.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.880
1960, Hurricane Donna.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.280
Who calmed Stephen down?

41:27.280 --> 41:31.000
It took me the better part
of an hour to convince him

41:31.000 --> 41:34.880
that thunder
wasn't the least bit dangerous.

41:34.880 --> 41:38.880
It's the lightning
that's going to kill him.

41:39.360 --> 41:43.160
Oh, Pete, you're just
lonely in there, weren't you?

41:43.160 --> 41:45.240
Here, honey,

41:45.240 --> 41:48.080
say hello to your Uncle Mark.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.960
There we go.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.840
There.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.840
You're just going to leave him
sitting there?

41:55.840 --> 41:59.840
Tell him a story. Try Goldilocks.

41:59.920 --> 42:03.920
That's not funny, Ellen.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.520
Is that the one with the wolf?

42:08.520 --> 42:11.800
No, the three bears.

42:11.800 --> 42:15.800
My mother didn't raise me
to be a raconteur.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.040
Um. Once upon a time...

42:21.040 --> 42:22.680
That's a nice kickoff.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.760
Three bears went into a house.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.720
There was the baby bear

42:27.720 --> 42:29.920
and the father bear
and the mother bear,

42:29.920 --> 42:31.760
who was no help at all.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.000
Good night.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
And the father bear said, "Please,
baby bear, don't cry any more.

42:37.560 --> 42:41.560
"I have to perform bypass surgery
in the morning."

42:43.560 --> 42:45.880
Well, just you wait, Donald,
in a couple of weeks,

42:45.880 --> 42:47.840
I'll be tap dancing in to see you.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.000
I believe you.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.280
Hello, Dr Westphall.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.080
Your mother's all set.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.640
I brought someone to see you.

42:53.640 --> 42:56.360
Toby! Toby, darling.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.960
I'm sorry, Doctor,
but every once in a while,

42:58.960 --> 43:00.480
you've got to break the rules.

43:00.480 --> 43:03.480
I better get out of here
before the charge nurse catches us.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.920
I'll see you in two weeks.

43:04.920 --> 43:08.600
I hate hospitals, but as hospitals
go, this one isn't bad.

43:08.600 --> 43:09.920
Goodbye.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.760
Bye-bye.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.720
Mother, I've made a decision.

43:13.720 --> 43:16.200
And I don't want any ifs,
ands or buts.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.120
I don't care what you say
or what Harriet says,

43:19.120 --> 43:21.200
I'm putting my foot down,
you're coming with us.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.400
Are you telling me
that Harriet doesn't want me?

43:23.400 --> 43:27.400
Well, she threatened to divorce me,
but I told her to go stuff it.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.040
Good for you.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.320
You're coming to live with us,
that's final.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.320
Well, we can at least give it a try.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.480
Do you mean it?

43:34.480 --> 43:36.000
Yes, I've made up my mind.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.080
Three months trial run.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.480
Is that OK, Toby?

43:40.480 --> 43:42.720
Is Herriot still allergic to dogs?

43:42.720 --> 43:46.360
Yes, yes.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.160
Oh, I guess that this is goodbye.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.160
I didn't really mind
all your stories, you know?

43:52.160 --> 43:53.720
They're called lies.

43:53.720 --> 43:56.440
Well, they were fun.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.520
Goodbye.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.680
Bye.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.120
Hello.

44:01.120 --> 44:05.120
Goodbye.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.240
I counted on a private room.
They should have told me

44:19.240 --> 44:21.440
they were going to put me
in with other people.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.240
Yes, Ms Coleman.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.560
Here we are.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.360
This is for the bed and this button
buzzes out at the nurses' station.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.360
So, if you want 20 minutes
of nobody bothering you, push it.

44:31.360 --> 44:35.360
The bathroom is over there.

44:41.640 --> 44:45.640
Excuse me, how did
the woman in that bed before me do?

44:46.520 --> 44:47.640
Do how?

44:47.640 --> 44:49.880
Did she make it?

44:49.880 --> 44:52.640
Oh! Great.

44:52.640 --> 44:56.640
Good.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.160
What happened to your nose?

44:59.160 --> 45:01.360
My nose?

45:01.360 --> 45:04.520
Did you have some kind of accident?

45:04.520 --> 45:08.120
Hey, didn't you
read about it in the newspaper?

45:08.120 --> 45:09.480
No.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.200
Do you follow roller derby?

45:11.200 --> 45:13.280
I did once, yes.

45:13.280 --> 45:16.680
Yeah? For years I skated
with the New Jersey Chiefs.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.640
You look awfully slim to be
a roller derby skater.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.280
Were you a jammer or a breakaway?

45:21.280 --> 45:24.000
I specialised in breakaways.
I could go like the wind.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.320
You know, sometimes,
just to keep it interesting,

45:26.320 --> 45:28.280
I used to skate backwards
for several laps.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.560
I see. What does that have to do
with your nose?

45:30.560 --> 45:32.240
Oh, I'm getting there, just a second.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.760
Now, one Sunday afternoon game,
it was what, I don't know,

45:34.760 --> 45:37.080
Hartford, Baltimore, one of those,
I can't remember.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.960
I was doing my famous trick
of skating backwards, you know,

45:39.960 --> 45:43.360
and I didn't realise how close
I was getting to the pack.

45:43.360 --> 45:47.160
As I turned around, the back
of the pack jammer elbowed me,

45:47.160 --> 45:51.160
broke my nose,
I got a deviated septum.

45:52.400 --> 45:55.560
You seriously expect me
to believe that story?

45:55.560 --> 45:59.320
Hey, lady, if you care to, I got
a team picture in that drawer,

45:59.320 --> 46:01.440
why don't you open it up
and look for yourself?

46:01.440 --> 46:05.440
I believe you.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.760
They were my happiest days.

46:07.760 --> 46:11.760
My roller derby period. Yeah.

46:12.480 --> 46:16.480
I just went by everybody like a blur.

46:22.840 --> 46:52.000
