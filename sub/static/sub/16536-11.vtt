00:01.585 --> 00:04.005
<i>Previously on
"Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:04.130 --> 00:06.173
The Capitol's been attacked.
Eagle is gone.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.134
- Congress, the cabinet.
- Oh, oh, my God.

00:08.259 --> 00:09.635
Sir, you are now the president.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.721
I received
a highly classified DOD file

00:11.846 --> 00:13.639
detailing how to blow up the Capitol.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.808
I think there's a traitor
in the White House.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.310
I had to put down everyone's name
who had security clearance.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.104
Aaron's on this list.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.148
The Capitol blew up
and everyone died

00:22.273 --> 00:23.691
except Congressman Peter MacLeish.

00:23.816 --> 00:24.817
He's in on it.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.652
How does vice president sound to you?

00:26.777 --> 00:28.195
I would be honored.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.656
This is exactly
what we've been working for.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.325
- But at what cost?
- At any cost necessary.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.661
Peter MacLeish and the CIA's
most wanted mercenary

00:35.786 --> 00:37.121
were on the same mission.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.498
- MacLeish isn't a war hero.
- He's a war criminal.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.042
Hannah Wells, an FBI agent,

00:41.167 --> 00:43.794
told me she had evidence
against Peter MacLeish.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.008
Were you able
to find out about the key card?

00:49.133 --> 00:52.803
It gives you access to room 7
on the 8th floor of the PLC Building.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.682
Proximity to the Capitol,
direct line of sight to the platform.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.976
<i>Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.</i>

00:59.101 --> 01:01.020
They're gonna kill Kirkman.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.034
Gun!

01:21.665 --> 01:23.626
No!

01:30.674 --> 01:32.051
Alex, you've been hit.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.970
That's not my blood.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.640
Oh, my God.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.356
Help!

01:47.316 --> 01:49.693
They're on their way.
Clear the hall!

01:50.361 --> 01:51.529
Hallway clear!

01:53.531 --> 01:56.075
I've got a GSW
between the left axilla and clavicle.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.203
Patient is alert and oriented.
I got B.P. at 136/92,

01:59.328 --> 02:03.082
heart rate 114, normal sinus rhythm,
SPO2 at 98%.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.750
1... 2... 3.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.670
Type and cross six units,
two large-bore I.V.s wide-open.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.214
And get portable X-ray in here.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.925
Mr. President, we're gonna roll you over
for a moment if that's okay.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.053
- Yeah, I'm going to get X-ray.
- It's okay, it's okay.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.597
Right there...
it could be a 30-caliber

02:18.722 --> 02:20.683
or a Blackout, maybe even a 5.56.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.560
It looks like it just missed the scapula.

02:22.685 --> 02:23.686
And down.

02:24.728 --> 02:27.106
Mr. President,
we're gonna take some X-rays

02:27.231 --> 02:28.607
to rule out lung or vascular damage,

02:28.732 --> 02:30.901
but it looks like the bullet
went straight through.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.738
Now we're going to clean and irrigate,
so bear with us.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.741
Deep breaths, Mr. President.
This will sting.

02:48.711 --> 02:51.213
<i>The American people
somberly await the news</i>

02:51.338 --> 02:53.299
<i>if their president
is alive or dead.</i>

02:53.424 --> 02:54.925
I don't care what he told you.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.219
I'm telling you, take that crap
off your air right now.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.805
It's not just irresponsible,
it's dangerous,

02:59.930 --> 03:02.224
and nobody cares about
a correction after the fact.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.435
You can speculate
from the outside looking in,

03:04.560 --> 03:07.438
and if you keep it up, you can do
your stand-ups from Guam.

03:07.563 --> 03:08.647
Unbelievable.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.733
What the hell
is taking so long?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.651
We should have
heard something by now.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.572
- Emily.
- What?

03:18.949 --> 03:21.368
Oh, my God.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.832
Hey, hey, hey.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.584
It's gonna be okay.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.378
You don't know. Nobody knows that.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.714
No, no, that-that's unacceptable.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.926
I want a full report from the agent
in charge every 15 minutes

03:37.051 --> 03:39.386
until the shooter is in custody.
Is that understood?

03:40.304 --> 03:41.597
Okay.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.016
The NSA, FBI,
every local law-enforcement's

03:44.141 --> 03:46.644
on the hunt for the shooter.
They think he's in the metro area,

03:46.769 --> 03:49.271
but that's like saying the needle's
somewhere in the haystack.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.816
You okay?

03:53.609 --> 03:56.278
We should get talking points to
the Congressional leadership, the USUN,

03:56.403 --> 03:58.530
- and the acting cabinet secretaries.
- That's all been taken care of.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.865
Communications took charge of that.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.867
I'll make sure the accurate information
is out there.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.370
- Alex?
- Mrs. Kirkman?

04:04.495 --> 04:05.704
How is he?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.373
We're waiting on the X-rays,

04:07.498 --> 04:09.833
but it seems like the bullet
went in and out.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.418
It didn't hit anything vital.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.881
Um, I know he wants
to see all of you,

04:16.005 --> 04:19.009
but if we could please
not overwhelm him.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.484
Don't worry. It's safe.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.028
We got it from the cafe
down the street.

04:41.031 --> 04:41.865
So...

04:43.200 --> 04:44.827
you flee the scene of an accident.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.204
That's a felony hit-and-run.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.748
You kill a man in Fredericksburg
who's an eyewitness.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.918
That's gonna be manslaughter,
at the very least.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.921
And then you show up to the vice
president's swearing-in ceremony,

04:56.046 --> 04:59.216
firing a gun and carrying this.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.388
It's a key card to the building
where the shots came from.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.561
That's conspiracy to kill the president.
That's the death penalty.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.774
Now, I want to believe that
you have good reasons for all of this,

05:15.899 --> 05:19.236
but if you don't tell me what they are,
I can't help you walk out of here.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.867
I'm offering you a lifeline, Hannah.
Take it.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.706
I've already made my statement.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.500
I have nothing else to say.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.715
It's a shame,

05:40.716 --> 05:44.136
because someone is gonna waste away
in federal prison for this.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.514
So you better think hard
about how you want this to play out,

05:48.098 --> 05:49.641
because your options...

05:49.767 --> 05:52.853
...are about to get real small,
real fast.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.543
Do we know who did this?

06:16.668 --> 06:18.587
The FBI's combing through
surveillance footage, sir.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.672
They're trying to get an I.D.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.175
We need to stabilize the markets.
They're gonna go crazy.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.843
Trading is already closed for the day.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.179
We'll keep a close eye
on the global markets tonight, sir.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.014
I should make a statement to the press.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.849
Right, of course.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.434
Let the country know that I'm fine,

06:32.559 --> 06:35.729
and I'll be back in the Oval Office
as soon as the doctors clear me.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.689
Definitely, Mr. President.

06:37.815 --> 06:38.899
Make me proud.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.359
Thank you, sir.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.320
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.366
Oh, my God.

06:48.826 --> 06:52.371
Yes, of course.
I just thank the Lord he's okay.

06:54.373 --> 06:57.167
Yeah, I'll hold the fort down on my end.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.169
Okay.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.672
Thank you for calling.

07:08.011 --> 07:08.846
He's alive.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.433
Bullet went straight through,
no lasting damage.

07:12.558 --> 07:13.725
How the hell does this happen?

07:13.851 --> 07:16.061
Just relax, all right?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.897
We need to wash
our hands of this right now,

07:19.022 --> 07:20.357
before it gets back to us.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.277
Wash our hands of this?
Peter, blood doesn't wash out, it stains,

07:23.402 --> 07:25.946
which is why we keep moving forward.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.406
It's just a setback.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.494
- And what if they catch Lozano?
- They won't.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.290
He was trained for this, so were you.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.417
Brothers in arms, remember?

07:39.418 --> 07:42.379
And the mission didn't entirely fail,
did it...

07:44.214 --> 07:46.216
...Mr. Vice President?

07:51.555 --> 07:53.307
Hannah Wells?

07:53.432 --> 07:55.267
- That's who they have in custody?
- Yes, sir.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.769
I spoke with Director Foerstel,

07:57.895 --> 08:00.772
and District Police picked her up
in the proximity of the sniper

08:00.898 --> 08:02.566
just after she discharged her weapon.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.446
Mike, I know you think
you have to be here with me,

08:08.864 --> 08:10.449
but I'm gonna be fine.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.577
What I really need you to do
is go down there and talk to her

08:13.702 --> 08:15.245
and find out what she knows.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.458
It's the only chance we have of finding
out what the hell is going on.

08:20.626 --> 08:21.710
Yes, sir.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.879
Thank you.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.392
I'm so, so sorry.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.145
He's alive. That's all that matters.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.733
W-What is it?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.282
I know this isn't the right time,

08:53.116 --> 08:54.826
but yesterday,
the president asked me

08:54.952 --> 08:56.662
to look into
a highly classified situation.

08:56.787 --> 08:57.955
- I know.
- Okay.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.831
- Did you find anything?
- I think so.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.626
Um, there was a call made
from the White House

09:02.751 --> 09:04.294
to kill the report.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.506
And that call came from Aaron's office.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.175
- What?
- I know.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.387
I-I was trying to tell the president,
but I couldn't get to him in time,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.347
and I don't know what--
What do I do?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.975
You need to keep Aaron
away from my husband, okay?

09:18.100 --> 09:19.184
- Have you got that?
- Yes.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.144
Okay. Thank you.

09:30.279 --> 09:34.199
Mr. President, I need to talk to you
about your latest C.T. scans, sir.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.702
- Why? Is there a problem?
- Yes.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.788
It shows several bullet fragments
lodged in your chest.

09:40.163 --> 09:44.668
If one were to dislodge, it could sever
your aorta and prove fatal.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.838
Sir, we need to operate
as soon as possible.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.175
Okay. I understand.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.886
- Thank you.
- We'll start prepping the O.R.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.179
Thank you, sir.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.808
Hey.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.310
Hey.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.899
We need to talk.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.696
<i>It looks like
I'll have to go into surgery after all.</i>

10:13.572 --> 10:16.867
<i>I'll be under general anesthetic
for at least three hours.</i>

10:16.992 --> 10:19.077
What's the protocol for that?

10:19.202 --> 10:20.912
Well, sir, if you're unconscious,

10:21.038 --> 10:24.458
that means you'll be incapable
to discharge your duties as president.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.793
So we'll have to invoke
the 25th Amendment.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.920
Okay, how do we do that?

10:29.046 --> 10:30.464
<i>We'll notify the Speaker of the House</i>

10:30.589 --> 10:33.467
and the president pro tem of the Senate
through a signed and written statement

10:33.592 --> 10:35.719
that you'll be temporarily
vacating the office.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.096
And Peter MacLeish
will be acting president.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.976
I'll set up a call with you and the V.P.
immediately, sir.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.187
No. I want to talk
to Speaker Hookstraten.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.733
- Sir?
- Get Kimble here as quickly as possible.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.735
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Thank you.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.280
Hookstraten? What's that all about?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.615
I have no idea.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.659
So, just a reminder:

10:58.784 --> 11:01.411
the 25th Amendment has been invoked
several times in the past.

11:01.536 --> 11:04.122
Both Presidents Reagan and Bush 43

11:04.247 --> 11:06.500
temporarily transferred power
to their vice presidents,

11:06.625 --> 11:08.627
so this is not unprecedented.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.462
- Yes, Gary?
- Do we know what the odds are

11:10.587 --> 11:13.256
for a major surgery like this?
I mean, in terms of patient survival.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.300
So, I'm not prepared
to answer that right now,

11:15.425 --> 11:17.803
but the medical team is gonna be
briefing the press pool

11:17.928 --> 11:19.763
after the successful completion
of President Kirkman's surgery.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.974
Until then, I'll just be updating you
on as-needed basis. Natalie?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.351
How are the president's spirits?

11:24.476 --> 11:26.520
You know, all things considered,
he's doing well.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.147
He's resting and focusing
on the business of running the country.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.317
Just a quick follow-up. Has the president
spoken to Vice President MacLeish yet?

11:32.442 --> 11:35.153
If that hasn't already happened,
then, uh, it will be taking place

11:35.278 --> 11:37.030
before President Kirkman
goes into surgery.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.412
Sir?

11:46.915 --> 11:47.999
Can I have the room, please?

11:54.339 --> 11:56.633
Mr. President, how are you feeling?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.177
Like I've been shot.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.558
Well, at least your sense of humor
is still intact.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.649
Kimble, I'm gonna have to invoke
the 25th Amendment,

12:13.692 --> 12:16.319
which means that Peter MacLeish
will be president.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.656
For how long?

12:20.323 --> 12:21.491
I don't know.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.495
We haven't always agreed on everything,

12:25.620 --> 12:28.957
but I've always felt that
your heart was in the right place.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.717
I need you to keep an eye
on the vice president,

12:38.842 --> 12:43.138
make sure he's working in the country's
best interests, not his own.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.057
You understand what I'm saying?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.727
I do, sir.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.354
I'm counting on you.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.358
I won't let you down, Mr. President.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.737
Has she said anything
since we spoke?

12:58.862 --> 13:00.739
No, I'm afraid not.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.618
I'd like to question her,
if it's all right.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.996
You know, under any other circumstances,
I'd have to say no.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.542
But nothing about this
makes any sense.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.085
Maybe she'll talk to you.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.253
Thanks.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.463
Just so we're clear,

13:16.588 --> 13:19.007
if she gives you anything,
you share it with me.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.778
Good afternoon.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.575
My name is Mike Ritter, Secret Service.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.871
I'm assigned to the president's
personal protection detail.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.669
Yesterday you were brought
to the president's attention

13:55.794 --> 13:57.420
by Speaker Hookstraten.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.673
She said you claimed
to have had information

13:59.798 --> 14:02.926
about Vice President MacLeish
before he was confirmed.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.887
The president would like to know
what that information was.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.394
<i>Agent Wells, you need
to answer my question.</i>

14:13.311 --> 14:14.646
<i>No, I don't.</i>

14:14.771 --> 14:16.231
<i>And why is that?</i>

14:17.065 --> 14:18.316
<i>Because I don't know you.</i>

14:18.441 --> 14:20.944
And if the president wants answers,

14:21.069 --> 14:24.072
I'll give them to one person:
the president himself.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.619
Hey, come here.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.293
I'm gonna be fine.
I don't want you to worry.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.008
Mr. President, it's time, sir.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.303
Sorry, ma'am,
we need to take him now.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.695
- I.V. wide-open.
- Go ahead, set it up.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.826
They're going to administer
the anesthetic.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.873
<i>And then I'll ask you to please
count down backwards from 100.</i>

15:16.833 --> 15:17.792
100...

15:21.671 --> 15:22.881
<i>...99...</i>

15:27.010 --> 15:28.011
<i>...98...</i>

15:31.348 --> 15:32.682
...97...

15:35.518 --> 15:36.519
...96...

15:42.859 --> 15:44.194
...95...

15:45.403 --> 15:47.155
<i>The president is unconscious.</i>

15:51.910 --> 15:54.871
Sir, you're now the acting president
of the United States.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.172
Number 4 dissector, please.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.383
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.426
Suction.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.803
More gauze.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.721
- Gauze and forceps.
- How's the drainage?

16:12.389 --> 16:14.099
- Right there.
- Good. Hold it.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.560
It's delicate surgery, Peter.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.271
If he doesn't survive it,
then we have nothing to worry about.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.565
- We are right back on track.
- Okay.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.901
Well, Lozano is still out there.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.445
FBI, Homeland, someone must have
a lead on him by now.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.073
And then, as acting president,

16:30.198 --> 16:32.283
you can insist
they report directly to you.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.785
If they catch him or get close,

16:33.910 --> 16:35.620
you'll be right there
to issue your orders.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.455
And what if the president
wakes up before then?

16:37.580 --> 16:40.583
You've got at least a few hours.
Make the most of them.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.711
- Okay.
- Sir?

16:43.294 --> 16:45.588
You're needed inside. Madam.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.216
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.643
All right, everyone,

16:58.768 --> 17:00.854
I need all eyes and ears
over here right now, please.

17:00.979 --> 17:01.813
Who's first?

17:01.938 --> 17:03.648
Mr. Vice President,

17:03.773 --> 17:05.358
Asian markets are in free fall.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.653
The Nikkei and Hang Seng
opened down almost 2,000 points

17:08.778 --> 17:10.320
on reports of the president's surgery.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.157
We need the SEC to keep stock markets
closed tomorrow.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.202
- Uh, no, that's not a good idea.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President,

17:16.327 --> 17:18.872
but even with circuit breaks in place
to halt market panic,

17:18.997 --> 17:21.499
just a 10% drop will wipe billions
from people's accounts.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.877
- That's pensions and 529 college funds.
- And she's right, sir.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.128
What's lost in hours can take years
to regain.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.631
I understand, but you're talking
about market forces.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.217
This isn't 2008.
Banks aren't failing.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.136
It's psychology.
It's herd mentality.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.345
If there is a sell-off,

17:34.471 --> 17:36.681
then it's a buying opportunity
and the market bounces back.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.851
We need to tell the world
that America is open for business.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.146
Excuse me, sir,
the markets hate uncertainty.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.148
You're just encouraging panic selling.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.150
Well, I think people are
comforted by routine.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.694
If we act like we're panicked,
then opinion will follow.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.696
Okay, where are we with the shooter?

17:51.821 --> 17:54.532
A vehicle was reported stolen
from a parking garage

17:54.657 --> 17:56.076
two blocks from the shooting site.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.162
District Police recovered an image
from the lot's surveillance camera

17:59.287 --> 18:01.414
and are trying to see
if it matches eyewitness description.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.916
- Great.
- In the meantime,

18:03.041 --> 18:04.542
we're coordinating
our manhunt from the CTOC--

18:04.667 --> 18:07.879
No. Uh, have CTOC coordinate with
Command Ops here in the White House.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.924
Sir, CTOC is perfectly capable
of handling an operation like that.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.384
I know, but I have a responsibility
to protect this country.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.053
I don't want to be
doing that over the phone.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.888
I want to be right here with you

18:17.013 --> 18:18.973
when we find the monster
that tried to kill him.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.353
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

18:23.978 --> 18:24.979
Who's next?

18:27.690 --> 18:29.067
Agent Wells...

18:30.318 --> 18:32.028
I've got an update for you.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.197
I'm free to go?

18:35.865 --> 18:36.991
Not exactly.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.578
It's about your sit-down
with the president.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.247
Great. When's he getting here?

18:42.372 --> 18:44.874
Afraid it's not gonna be that simple.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.836
The president's
undergoing surgery right now.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.463
He had to invoke the 25th.

18:50.588 --> 18:51.881
The 25th?

18:54.050 --> 18:54.884
Wait a minute.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.719
Peter MacLeish is president?

18:58.221 --> 18:59.180
Yeah.

19:01.724 --> 19:02.892
Hannah...

19:03.560 --> 19:06.354
tell me what evidence you have
against Peter MacLeish.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.799
Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.467
What can I do for you, Kimble?

19:36.593 --> 19:39.137
You can tell me
what the hell's going on in your mind.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.473
You know if you open those markets
tomorrow, it'll be a disaster.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.474
No, I don't.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.268
And in case you've forgotten,

19:45.393 --> 19:47.395
you're addressing the office
of the acting president.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.772
You know, Peter,

19:50.273 --> 19:52.942
when you first arrived in Congress,
I thought you were...

19:53.651 --> 19:55.403
well... ordinary.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.323
Another first-termer
just happy to be there,

19:58.448 --> 19:59.824
a man whose achievements

19:59.949 --> 20:02.785
had far outstripped
even his own imagination.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.621
But I realize now

20:05.413 --> 20:07.498
that I'd underestimated you;

20:08.082 --> 20:10.793
your drive, your ambition.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.130
There's nothing ordinary about you.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.133
Well, thank you.
I appreciate you saying that.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.427
Just know I'll be watching you.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.513
Others may be distracted
by what's happening today,

20:22.639 --> 20:23.806
but not me.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.227
If I see anything out of step,

20:27.352 --> 20:30.396
I'll take my suspicions
straight to the White House press corps.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.731
Are you threatening me?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.524
Absolutely...

20:33.942 --> 20:34.817
sir.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.365
Excuse me, sir. They found the shooter.
They're waiting for you at Command Ops.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.991
- Madam.
- I'll be right there.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.537
And, Kimble...
thanks for coming by.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.210
Agent Wells, please.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.672
What were you gonna tell the speaker
about Peter MacLeish?

20:56.839 --> 20:58.675
Does it have something to do with...

20:59.676 --> 21:02.303
with this man that you shot
outside Fredericksburg?

21:04.305 --> 21:05.682
Or this guy? We...

21:07.725 --> 21:09.686
We haven't found a name for him yet.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.861
We believe he's responsible
for shooting President Kirkman.

21:19.862 --> 21:20.905
Do you know him?

21:22.740 --> 21:23.658
Hannah?

21:26.869 --> 21:27.996
Hannah?

21:39.507 --> 21:42.260
Agent Wells,
do you recognize this man?

21:58.526 --> 21:59.736
All right.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.324
<i>Can't say I didn't try.</i>

22:04.449 --> 22:06.284
<i>You know, maybe Foerstel's
right about you.</i>

22:06.409 --> 22:08.536
Your paranoia got the best of you.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.752
Get everybody in here now!

22:17.420 --> 22:19.630
Find Chuck Russink.
Ask about Catalan.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.760
Let him go! Let him go!

22:23.885 --> 22:25.762
Hey! That's it!

22:26.721 --> 22:27.805
Get her out of here.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.149
Attention!

22:38.274 --> 22:40.860
It's fine. Stay seated.
Thank you. Director.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.821
Sir, suspect was tracked
to a marine storage facility.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.406
He's barricaded himself inside.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.454
Any other way out?

22:51.579 --> 22:53.539
<i>No, sir. We've got him surrounded.</i>

22:53.664 --> 22:57.293
Suspect appears to be highly trained
in evasive tactics and combat skills.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.755
Could be Special Forces,
or was at one time.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.008
Give the order to apprehend.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.468
<i>Proceed with apprehension.</i>

23:06.344 --> 23:08.930
- Excuse me?
- It's standard operating procedure, sir.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.182
Deadly force to be applied if defense,

23:11.307 --> 23:13.976
but, in all other cases,
we take our suspects alive.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.939
No, that's a mistake.

23:18.481 --> 23:19.315
Sir?

23:19.440 --> 23:22.485
There's no reason to put good men at risk
trying to apprehend an assassin.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.737
If anyone on the ground
gets this man in their sights,

23:24.862 --> 23:26.906
- I want him taken out.
- Mr. Vice President--

23:27.031 --> 23:28.157
That's my decision.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.493
Give the order.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.578
President Kirkman would have wanted
to take him alive, sir.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.414
- You don't know that.
- I believe I do.

23:34.539 --> 23:35.498
Okay.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.583
He'll want answers to questions
only the shooter can give.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.836
That's why we took Nassar alive.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.504
I disagree.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.172
Give the order. Shoot to kill.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.094
Prepare to execute.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.095
<i>Prepare to execute.</i>

23:49.220 --> 23:50.388
<i>Copy that.</i>

23:51.139 --> 23:52.181
<i>Prepare to enter.</i>

23:53.850 --> 23:56.269
Mr. Vice President, I'm advising
against this course of action,

23:56.394 --> 23:58.020
- in the strongest of terms.
- Noted.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.691
I have a duty, sir,
to you and the president--

24:01.816 --> 24:03.818
And you've-you've carried it out.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.071
Give the order.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.740
Shoot to kill.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.034
<i>Roger that.
Shoot to kill.</i>

24:12.702 --> 24:13.744
<i>Shoot to kill.</i>

24:13.870 --> 24:15.538
<i>Roger. Shoot to kill.</i>

24:16.205 --> 24:19.250
<i>Open fire.
Execute, execute, execute.</i>

24:22.044 --> 24:23.671
<i>Target's down.
He's not moving.</i>

24:24.422 --> 24:25.756
<i>Target neutralized.</i>

24:25.882 --> 24:28.092
<i>Stand by for confirmation.</i>

24:28.217 --> 24:29.760
<i>Target is neutralized.</i>

24:30.219 --> 24:31.262
<i>Roger that.</i>

24:31.387 --> 24:33.055
<i>Target is neutralized.</i>

24:39.353 --> 24:42.315
We're now over an hour
into President Kirkman's surgery,

24:42.440 --> 24:45.109
and so far,
no news seems to be good news.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.945
Meanwhile, well-wishers continue
to pour in from all over,

24:48.070 --> 24:49.780
laying flowers, holding signs,

24:49.906 --> 24:53.284
and praying for a swift recovery
of their president.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.952
Keep pressure down in there, please.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.088
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

25:08.090 --> 25:10.593
So, you won't believe this.

25:10.718 --> 25:13.346
McKibben just told me that
Manhattan Children's Rights Fund

25:13.471 --> 25:15.348
needs a new chief counsel.

25:15.473 --> 25:16.974
And he's recommending me.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.809
You're a warrior. He knows it.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.937
So does every law firm in New York.

25:21.062 --> 25:21.938
No.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.314
How was your day?

25:23.439 --> 25:26.484
Interesting. I got a job offer, too.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.153
Don't tell me.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.863
They want you to chair the department.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.114
No.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.991
It was from the president.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.159
The president of what?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.744
The United States.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.039
He wants me to come on
as HUD secretary.

25:41.832 --> 25:42.792
What?

25:42.917 --> 25:46.003
He said he was really taken
by my housing initiative in Bedford Park

25:46.128 --> 25:49.507
and that he thought his cabinet
could use fresh ideas like mine.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.345
- Well, y-y-you said yes, right?
- No, I wanted to talk to you about it.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.681
What is there to talk about?
Tom, you have to do this.

25:56.806 --> 26:01.185
It's politics. I'd have to make speeches,
compromise. I mean...

26:01.310 --> 26:03.187
I might even have
to stand behind something

26:03.312 --> 26:04.855
I don't even believe in.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.400
I'm an urban planner, an architect.
I'm not a politician.

26:07.525 --> 26:08.526
Tom...

26:09.777 --> 26:14.156
<i>the</i> president of the United States
is asking <i>you</i> to serve.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.158
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.827
We'd have to move.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.538
The kids would have to find
new schools, start over. We all would.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.498
This would really change our lives.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.208
In ways that we can't even imagine.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.418
Okay...

26:25.543 --> 26:27.336
...there are times to say no,

26:28.004 --> 26:30.006
but this is not one of them.

26:31.549 --> 26:32.842
Warriors, right?

26:36.345 --> 26:37.346
Yeah.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.891
Warriors.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.942
Ma'am, I thought
you might need this.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.527
Thank you, Seth.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.406
- So, any news?
- No.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.203
You should go.
You should go home.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.414
And miss out on all this free coffee?
Come on.

27:04.373 --> 27:07.251
Besides, I've still got to babysit
these reporters outside.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.462
Well, sit down and talk to me.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.839
Sure. About what?

27:15.051 --> 27:16.385
Anything.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.222
Apart from, you know...

27:24.935 --> 27:26.270
Do you have a girlfriend?

27:26.395 --> 27:27.563
No.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.106
Do you want one?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.400
Uh, not right now.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.610
Why not?

27:32.735 --> 27:34.445
Just doesn't seem like
it's a good time.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.739
That's a terrible excuse.

27:37.448 --> 27:40.451
You always need to make time
for the things that are important.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.912
Ma'am, what I do is important.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.251
But not if you're doing it alone.

27:57.218 --> 27:59.178
This is all my fault.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.516
He didn't want the job at HUD.

28:03.641 --> 28:06.977
I made him take it.
I was the ambitious one.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.773
And now... look.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.442
Ma'am, you can't blame yourself for that.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.154
He's gonna be okay.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.452
Chuck Russink?

28:24.286 --> 28:25.996
I know you're inside.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.999
- Who is it?
- Agent Mike Ritter, Secret Service.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.018
What do you want?

28:48.144 --> 28:49.854
I want to talk to you
about Hannah Wells.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.189
I already told Director Foerstel
I don't know where she is.

28:52.314 --> 28:54.525
That's not the problem.
We know where she is.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.447
I'm interested in what she knows
about Peter MacLeish.

29:04.326 --> 29:07.496
Anyone can get an I.D. like that. Why
the hell should I open the door for you?

29:07.955 --> 29:10.207
Because if you don't,
I'll just kick it in.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.171
Yeah, well, convince me.
Tell me why I should let you inside.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.006
Catalan.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.310
- What?
- Wells gave me a message.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.687
She told me to ask you about Catalan.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.524
Convinced now?

29:37.151 --> 29:38.027
Yeah.

29:39.904 --> 29:42.907
<i>Many on Wall Street
are speculating that tomorrow's markets</i>

29:43.032 --> 29:45.075
<i>will experience the steepest nosedive</i>

29:45.201 --> 29:47.411
<i>since the Flash Crash of 2010.</i>

29:47.536 --> 29:49.246
<i>Investors are turning to assets...</i>

29:49.371 --> 29:52.208
<i>...that are seen as safer bets
in times of uncertainty. For--</i>

29:54.835 --> 29:55.836
Aaron Shore.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.547
Yeah.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.383
What?!

30:01.509 --> 30:03.886
I need to see the president's schedule
for the next 72 hours

30:04.011 --> 30:05.763
to know what to cancel
and what to surrogate.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.973
This is a list of all the Kirkmans'
family and friends.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.267
Please call them so they're not
hearing things from the TV.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.644
- I'm also going to need--
- Emily...

30:11.769 --> 30:13.896
- I'm gonna need a word with you, please.
- One second.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.774
We need Comms to draft talking points for
the switchboard and the protocol office.

30:16.899 --> 30:19.026
There are gonna be thousands
of phone calls coming in today,

30:19.151 --> 30:21.779
and we're gonna need them to know
what to tell people. Okay? Thanks.

30:23.572 --> 30:24.573
In here.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.079
What is it?

30:32.373 --> 30:34.250
You feel like telling me
what's going on?

30:34.375 --> 30:35.626
What are you talking about?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.795
I just got off the phone
with the White House archives.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.630
They were asking me
if I had authorized you

30:39.755 --> 30:41.924
to look at my personal phone logs
from two years ago.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.177
All right, so, I'll ask again.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.303
What's going on, Emily?

30:46.428 --> 30:48.597
- It must have been a miscommunication.
- Yeah, right.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.308
Like the other day when you told me
you were working late

30:51.433 --> 30:52.893
because the president
was having second thoughts

30:53.018 --> 30:54.478
on his choice for the HUD secretary,

30:54.603 --> 30:56.313
something the president
knew nothing about?

30:56.438 --> 30:57.815
What, was that
a miscommunication, too?

31:00.276 --> 31:01.986
Talk to me, Emily.
What's going on?

31:02.111 --> 31:04.363
I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
I'm sorry.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.990
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

31:06.115 --> 31:08.951
It means I can't talk about this with you.
It is between me and the president.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.286
About me?

31:12.329 --> 31:13.789
I'm not at liberty to discuss.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.125
- Excuse me.
- E-Emily, wait.

31:17.293 --> 31:19.003
Are-are you investigating me?

31:19.128 --> 31:21.839
You should wait to talk to the president
when he gets back.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.300
I'm sorry. I can't say any more.

31:32.474 --> 31:33.684
How are his vitals?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.728
B.P.'s steady,
but he's still a bit tachy.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.521
Minimal tearing
in the major vessels.

31:41.191 --> 31:43.402
- Make a cut above the clamp.
- Yep.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.486
Good. Okay.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.697
Hang another bag.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.198
Heart rate increasing, 136.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.534
O2 sat's now 95%.
I'm taking another pressure.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.995
One of the fragments
must have nicked an artery.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.163
Suction.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.876
His pressure is dropping... 98/74.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.004
Sponges. More sponges.
More sponges. Keep them coming.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.340
We got to find the source,
or he's gonna bleed out.

32:08.677 --> 32:09.762
Yeah.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.513
That's Catalan.

32:13.015 --> 32:15.017
He was in the same army unit
as Peter MacLeish.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.019
That's what Hannah uncovered.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.772
So, you're saying the vice president
is linked to the man

32:19.897 --> 32:21.690
who tried to assassinate the president?

32:22.191 --> 32:24.068
She got proof?

32:24.693 --> 32:26.028
She had proof,

32:26.862 --> 32:28.364
but it was stolen from her car.

32:30.658 --> 32:31.700
Stolen?

32:34.161 --> 32:35.829
You know, there's more out there...

32:36.372 --> 32:38.457
in some very classified files.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.126
So I hope you really do work
for the president,

32:41.251 --> 32:43.170
or we're wasting our time here.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.257
Hang two units
packed red blood cells... stat!

32:47.383 --> 32:48.425
Right away, Doctor.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.177
I need to clean the field.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.398
Vitals stabilizing.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.109
Okay.

33:05.234 --> 33:08.028
He's out of the woods.
All right, let's close him up.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.086
What are you doing out here?

33:24.753 --> 33:25.879
It's quiet.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.552
Kirkman's still in surgery?

33:35.055 --> 33:37.433
There was a complication, but, uh...

33:38.267 --> 33:40.269
it looks like he'll pull through.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.230
So will we.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.985
How the hell can you be
so sure of that?

33:51.989 --> 33:55.034
Because he's got nothing on us.
Catalan is dead.

33:55.159 --> 33:59.121
The evidence connecting you and him
doesn't exist anymore. Breathe, Peter.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.749
Everything is being handled accordingly.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.169
And what about Hookstraten?

34:05.627 --> 34:07.004
What about her?

34:07.463 --> 34:09.505
She's watching my every move.

34:09.630 --> 34:13.010
She questioned me when I forced the SEC
to keep the markets open.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.471
- If she figures out why--
- She won't.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.889
She might.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.516
Nothing can touch us. I told you that.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.645
And if she's a problem,
we remove her, too.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.692
So, how much longer
are they saying it's gonna be?

34:28.817 --> 34:31.527
<i>They're not,
but they say he's doing fine.</i>

34:31.652 --> 34:34.281
But, hopefully, they're gonna be
finished up soon.

34:34.656 --> 34:35.699
Is Penny asleep?

34:35.824 --> 34:38.702
<i>Only took about two books
and half a movie, but I got her down.</i>

34:38.827 --> 34:40.204
Which movie?

34:40.329 --> 34:41.914
<i>- The Revenant.</i>
- W-What?

34:42.039 --> 34:43.248
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>

34:43.373 --> 34:46.418
Just some cartoon princess movie.
It was painful.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.839
Well, you're the best.
Thank you so much, sweetie.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.425
I'm really proud of you.

34:53.550 --> 34:57.346
It was nothing. I mean, we're all doing
jobs we weren't doing before, right?

34:59.681 --> 35:00.849
<i>Mom?</i>

35:01.308 --> 35:02.392
You okay?

35:02.518 --> 35:03.352
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:03.477 --> 35:04.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.396
Hey, I got to hang up.

35:06.522 --> 35:09.191
The doctor's coming.
I'll call you right back, okay?

35:17.074 --> 35:18.325
Hey.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.536
Hey, Tom.

35:22.704 --> 35:23.664
Honey.

35:42.057 --> 35:42.891
Hey.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.524
Hi.

35:59.116 --> 36:00.993
As the world waits
for further word

36:01.118 --> 36:02.452
on the president's condition,

36:02.578 --> 36:05.247
all major indices
are continuing to plunge.

36:05.372 --> 36:10.127
The Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P are approaching
Black Monday-type losses.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.462
The Dow Jones Industrial Average

36:12.588 --> 36:16.842
has already plunged a staggering
2,000 points in one day,

36:16.967 --> 36:19.761
<i>after the shooting of President Kirkman.</i>

36:31.315 --> 36:33.483
You better not be eating my Jello.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.446
It's my Jello. I earned it.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.115
- Good morning.
- Hmm.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.994
What did the doctors say?

36:44.119 --> 36:46.330
They removed
all the bullet fragments,

36:46.455 --> 36:49.625
and they say
there is no permanent damage.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.835
Good.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.299
Last night, I kept hearing voices
out in the hall.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.761
Yeah. It was just people coming by
to see how you were.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.059
How is the country reacting?

37:07.184 --> 37:09.436
Tom, you don't need
to worry about that now.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.814
I thought I heard something
about the markets.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.985
Okay. MacLeish opened the markets.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.989
Wall Street's in a panic,
and stocks are plummeting.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.992
Why the hell would he do that?

37:24.701 --> 37:27.204
- We need to restore confidence.
- Well...

37:27.329 --> 37:29.414
Tom, how?

37:29.539 --> 37:31.291
You're on your back.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.211
Come on, Alex.

37:35.504 --> 37:37.506
Warriors, right?

37:40.842 --> 37:42.052
Come on, help me up.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.724
No, we're not hiding anything.
Look, I already told you.

37:47.849 --> 37:50.269
The president is out of surgery
and he's resting comfortably. Emily?

37:50.394 --> 37:52.729
- Has the 25th Amendment been revoked?
- Yes.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.357
As soon as the president was able
to reach Speaker Hookstraten

37:55.482 --> 37:58.568
and the Senate pro tem, he resumed
his duties as commander in chief. Gary?

37:58.694 --> 38:00.862
Seth, it's been two days.
When can we see him?

38:00.988 --> 38:02.906
- As soon as his doctors say so.
- When is that gonna be?

38:03.031 --> 38:04.783
People need to know
what condition their president's in.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.369
I already answered that question.
If any of you have questions

38:07.494 --> 38:09.454
I haven't already answered,
please feel free to ask.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.917
- Whoa! Hey! Over here!
- Look, over there!

38:37.274 --> 38:39.484
<i>And that was the scene earlier today</i>

38:39.609 --> 38:41.611
<i>at George Washington University
Medical Center</i>

38:41.737 --> 38:44.948
<i>as President Kirkman
waved to an adoring crowd,</i>

38:45.073 --> 38:47.784
<i>just hours after
his life-threatening surgery.</i>

38:47.909 --> 38:49.453
<i>After all the worldwide
concerns about his health</i>

38:49.578 --> 38:52.789
<i>plunged the global financial markets
into chaos,</i>

38:52.914 --> 38:56.960
<i>this was, indeed, an extraordinary
moment of hope and assurance.</i>

38:57.085 --> 38:58.128
<i>Immediately afterwards,</i>

38:58.253 --> 39:00.422
<i>the DOW and S&P
began to rebound,</i>

39:00.547 --> 39:03.967
<i>and showing significant gains
across the board.</i>

39:04.092 --> 39:05.927
<i>President Kirkman--</i>

39:15.270 --> 39:18.815
The Dow is up 450 points.
S&P is up 7%.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.109
- Looks like your wave paid off, sir.
- That's great news,

39:21.234 --> 39:23.528
but we've still got a lot of work to do.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.281
You still have a lot of recovery to do.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.991
And that, too.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.451
Where's Aaron?

39:29.576 --> 39:31.787
He's back at the office,
just finishing up a few things.

39:31.912 --> 39:34.247
Excuse me, Mr. President.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.209
Right.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.961
Can I have a moment, please?
Thank you.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.017
Is she here?

39:54.142 --> 39:55.811
Yes, sir.

39:57.104 --> 39:58.355
Bring her in.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.317
Clear the floor!

40:20.877 --> 40:22.295
It's all right, Mike.

40:31.638 --> 40:32.848
Agent Wells.

40:33.849 --> 40:35.016
Mr. President.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.519
I understand
you have some things

40:37.644 --> 40:39.563
you want to tell me
about Peter MacLeish.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.525
Yes, sir. I do.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.486
Then we should get started.
