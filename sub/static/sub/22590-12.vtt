WEBVTT

00:09.052 --> 00:11.971
<i>NARRATOR".
Another crystal-clear day in Londinium.</i>

00:12.138 --> 00:14.015
<i>Though things are getting a bit thick...</i>

00:14.182 --> 00:19.270
<i>...in Superintendent Watson's office
in venerable Ireland Yard.</i>

00:19.437 --> 00:23.566
Before we left Ffogg Place, we had ample
evidence that Lord Ffogg and Lady Peasoup...

00:23.733 --> 00:27.278
...could be the culprits you called us here
from Gotham City to uncover.

00:27.445 --> 00:31.324
The Delayed-Action Knock-Out Fog Capsule
that exploded in the Batmobile cinched it.

00:31.658 --> 00:35.537
Luckily, our General Emergency
Batextinguisher took care of that.

00:35.703 --> 00:39.332
Do you suppose those highwaymen
might have planted something similar...

00:39.499 --> 00:40.959
...on Batgirl's Cycle, Batman?

00:41.125 --> 00:42.210
Batgirl's Cycle?

00:42.377 --> 00:44.837
Yes, she turned up outside Ffogg Place.

00:45.004 --> 00:49.676
Don't ask me how or why
or where she went.

00:49.842 --> 00:53.972
We never really saw her Batgirl Cycle.
Remember, old churn?

00:54.138 --> 00:56.683
She may have escaped
completely unscathed.

00:56.849 --> 01:00.353
But how can Lord Ffogg be involved
in these robberies, Batman?

01:00.520 --> 01:03.147
With his gout so bad?
You saw his foot yourself.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.984
Possibly an act.

01:06.192 --> 01:07.694
Well, was it an act too...

01:07.860 --> 01:11.364
...that Lady Peasoup invited Ms. Gordon,
the commissioner's own daughter...

01:11.531 --> 01:14.659
...to join the faculty of Ffogg Place
even for a short while?

01:14.826 --> 01:18.538
I strongly recommend she does not accept.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.207
And I strongly recommend
that we do not offend...

01:21.374 --> 01:24.043
...one of the most aristocratic families
in the land.

01:24.210 --> 01:28.590
Holy gullibility. Pardon me, commissioner,
but she's headed for trouble.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.135
Lady Prudence, Lord Ffogg's daughter...

01:32.468 --> 01:35.722
Barbara, your ears must be burning.
We were just talking about you.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.557
Favorably, I trust.

01:37.724 --> 01:41.185
Your secretary asked me to bring this parcel in
to Batman, superintendent.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.771
It just arrived and she said I needn't knock--
Huh!

01:43.938 --> 01:45.857
Look out, Batman, it's smoking.

01:46.024 --> 01:48.109
Yes, it seems about to explode.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.528
You better all stand back.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

03:09.774 --> 03:11.526
Three silver bells.

03:12.110 --> 03:14.237
Holy tintinnabulation.

03:14.404 --> 03:16.489
They're pretty. But what could they mean?

03:16.656 --> 03:18.241
It could be a clue of some kind.

03:18.408 --> 03:20.785
Or a come-on.

03:20.952 --> 03:22.328
Exactly, Robin.

03:22.495 --> 03:25.623
Superintendent, isn't there a famous pub
somewhere in Londinium...

03:25.790 --> 03:27.083
...named the Three Bells?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.876
Oh, indeed there is, Batman.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.254
On the river in the dock area.

03:31.421 --> 03:34.298
Many's the pint of wallop I have there.
Ha, ha.

03:34.465 --> 03:37.218
Or had, I should say,
before the hippies took over.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.138
- Hippies?
-The mod set. Barnaby Street.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.098
They've taken over the Three Bells.

03:42.432 --> 03:46.686
Is there some kind of objective there
that a canny criminal might be interested in?

03:46.978 --> 03:53.025
Well, uh, ships loading and unloading
in the dock area nearby. But wait.

03:53.443 --> 03:57.280
There's a ship due to leave the dock
near the Three Bells late today.

03:57.447 --> 04:01.909
With a cargo of materials and patterns
from Barnaby Street, bound for our dominions.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.328
Holy rising hemlines.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.915
Are we being dared to stop
a robbery of miniskirts, Batman?

04:08.499 --> 04:11.419
<i>NARRATOR".
And shortly at Ffogg Place...</i>

04:11.586 --> 04:15.173
Our possible hostage is arriving
any minute now, Marmaduke.

04:15.339 --> 04:19.385
And I don't see why the girls and I
are expected to go down to the docks...

04:19.552 --> 04:21.053
...and be by the Three Bells.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.767
It was your idea, my sweet, to lift that cargo
bound for the dominions from Barnaby Street.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.645
Yes, but that was before we decided to fog in
on the Crown Jewels...

04:29.812 --> 04:31.314
...in the Tower of Londinium.

04:31.481 --> 04:34.567
A master plan involves various stages
of preparation, Penelope.

04:34.734 --> 04:38.571
This stage involves not only the purloining
of a shipment of material...

04:38.738 --> 04:41.365
...thereby controlling the fashion world
of Londinium...

04:41.532 --> 04:43.868
...but getting rid of Batman once and for all.

04:44.035 --> 04:47.330
Batman, who,
if he has received my pungent parcel...

04:47.497 --> 04:49.457
...should be in the Three Bells.

04:49.624 --> 04:52.418
Ms. Gordon, Your Ladyship.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.591
How nice to see you again, Ms. Gordon.

04:58.758 --> 05:01.594
But I'm afraid we've had
a slight change of plan.

05:01.761 --> 05:04.806
The girls and I have to run into Londinium...

05:04.972 --> 05:08.601
...and Lord Ffogg has an appointment
in the city too.

05:08.768 --> 05:11.687
I'm so glad to see your gout is better,
Lord Ffogg.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.314
MY gout? Oh, yes.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.359
It always improves
with the change of weather.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.279
Well, I'll have a chance to meet
the rest of the faculty, anyway.

05:20.446 --> 05:23.282
I am the rest of the faculty, Ms. Gordon.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.035
Along with Lady Prudence, of course.

05:26.202 --> 05:30.331
Speaking of Lady Prudence, sister dear, I think
she should remain here with Ms. Gordon.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.709
I think she'll show Ms. Gordon
everything Ms. Gordon should be shown.

05:33.876 --> 05:38.548
And now that we've gotten you all the way out
to Ffogg Place, we're not going to let you go.

05:41.092 --> 05:44.554
Meanwhile in Londinium's dock area...

05:53.312 --> 05:55.606
This is the pub, old chum.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.359
And that appears to be the ship.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.736
With its cargo from Barnaby Street.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.446
Let's go.

06:02.864 --> 06:04.031
Not you, Robin.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.617
They have strict licensing laws
in this country.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.870
A boy of your age is not allowed in a tavern.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.706
But if it's been taken over
by the hippies and mod set...

06:11.873 --> 06:14.333
You're far from mod, Robin.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.502
And many hippies are older than you are.

06:16.669 --> 06:21.299
Why don't you wait by the Batmobile?
I have a hunch that you'll be of good use there.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.593
You'll know where to find me
if you need me.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.511
Right, Batman.

06:51.621 --> 06:54.081
A far cry from the old days, Your Lordship.

06:54.248 --> 06:58.628
It was more fun when the Three Bells
was full of foot pegs and cutthroats.

06:59.211 --> 07:03.132
- Aye, me folks used to come here then.
-The world changes, fellows.

07:03.299 --> 07:06.761
Skirts go up and beards grow out,
but a pound note still does its job.

07:06.928 --> 07:09.305
Yeah, you're right. Sure.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.602
Batman.

07:16.729 --> 07:18.856
Batman, indeed.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.943
Delighted to see that your gout has cleared up,
Lord Ffogg.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.487
You're the second observant person
I've met today.

07:24.654 --> 07:27.907
- Would you care to join us in a tankard?
-I don't drink.

07:28.074 --> 07:30.743
Not to drink, old boy?
What are you doing in this pub?

07:31.994 --> 07:34.789
I suspect you can answer that better than I.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.415
No doubt I can.

08:35.265 --> 08:39.186
Very agile, Batman, but hardly observant.
Otherwise you'd have realized...

08:39.352 --> 08:44.150
...that every person in this pub knows
where his next meal is coming from.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.487
<i>NARRATOR".
And while the Caped Crusader is cornered...</i>

09:04.420 --> 09:06.505
- Oh, it's Robin, the Boy Wonder.
-Oh.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.228
I'm out of my skin.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.855
You're out of your mind.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.356
He's cut the boat loose.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.941
It's drifting away.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.402
With all those crazy mod materials.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.366
Use your wits, girls, as you've been taught.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.703
- You too, Duchess.
-Groovy.

09:45.211 --> 09:47.463
You 20th-century witch, Lady Peasoup.

09:47.630 --> 09:51.258
You know I wouldn't fight a female.
Even a small army of females.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.886
Spoken like a true gentleman, Boy Wonder.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.389
Gosh, what marvelous threads.

09:59.058 --> 10:01.477
Now, now, now, girls,
stop gushing and pick him up.

10:01.811 --> 10:03.938
We must get out of here.

10:08.943 --> 10:11.862
<i>NARRATOR". Back in their rendezvous
outside Ffogg Place...</i>

10:12.029 --> 10:14.615
I don't understand that Lady Prudence,
Alfred.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.242
Lord Ffogg's daughter.

10:16.408 --> 10:20.287
But I strongly suspect Lady Peasoup
is running a school for gentlecrooks...

10:20.454 --> 10:21.622
...not gentlewomen.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.542
- She told you that?
-Not in so many words.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.586
But I think there's strong feeling
between her and her aunt.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.924
And Lady Prudence could be playing all sides
against each other for reasons of her own.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.802
- How did you get away?
-It wasn't easy. I'll explain later.

10:34.969 --> 10:37.221
Now, back to the city
to report to your father?

10:37.388 --> 10:40.516
No, back to Lord Ffogg's Cricket Pavilion.

10:40.683 --> 10:44.186
It's the only place she didn't show me,
and I may learn something from it.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.648
Lord Ffogg allows no one
but his sister and himself inside it.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.359
And I'm not at all sure
that I can allow you, miss.

10:50.526 --> 10:52.486
Batgirl can take care of herself, Alfred.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.196
But you can do something for me.

10:54.363 --> 10:58.325
Get a message to my father telling him
I'll be staying here later than I'd expected.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.202
And ask him to alert Batman.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.830
- Can you do that?
-I can certainly try, miss.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.681
<i>NARRATOR". So it's back to being Batgirl
for Barbara Gordon.</i>

11:20.848 --> 11:22.892
<i>And in due time...</i>

11:28.022 --> 11:32.651
<i>...slipping into the forbidden Cricket Pavilion
at Ffogg Place.</i>

11:43.704 --> 11:47.166
"Count of Claremont's coin collection."

11:49.960 --> 11:53.172
"Duchess of Desborough's diamonds."

11:56.175 --> 11:59.845
"Her Majesty's priceless snuffboxes."

12:02.014 --> 12:06.143
And "Lady Easterland's
jeweled Easter eggs."

12:18.614 --> 12:22.368
<i>NARRATOR".
But whose side is Prudence on?</i>

12:53.190 --> 12:56.068
<i>While in the Three Bells pub...</i>

12:56.235 --> 12:59.363
By now, Lady Peasoup should be in control
of the boat's cargo.

12:59.530 --> 13:03.450
She should be in control of Barnaby Street
and the Londinium world of fashions.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.037
A step closer to the king of crime
mounting a suitable throne...

13:07.204 --> 13:09.540
...and wearing the Crown Jewels.

13:09.707 --> 13:11.750
So we may leave and leave Batman here.

13:11.917 --> 13:16.046
Here, Your Lordship?
Aren't you asking for a spot of trouble, sir?

13:16.213 --> 13:17.923
- Blimey.
- Don't worry, mates.

13:18.340 --> 13:22.261
Dynamic Dolt will remember nothing of what
has happened when I get through with him.

13:22.428 --> 13:24.346
Thanks to this remarkable device...

13:24.513 --> 13:26.932
...which when fastened to his skull
and activated...

13:27.099 --> 13:30.269
...will reverse the recollection center.

13:30.436 --> 13:33.522
I know nothing about your remarkable device,
Lord Ffogg.

13:33.689 --> 13:38.277
But your grisly game is almost up. Proof of
your villainy is inscribed indelibly on my mind.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.112
Which will shortly be erased.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.156
Hold his head still.

13:44.867 --> 13:49.455
Behold. No man has ever been more fogbound
than Batman at this very moment.

13:49.955 --> 13:53.292
You may untie him. He may not be able
to move for a moment or two...

13:53.459 --> 13:56.128
...but when he does,
his mind will be completely blank.

13:56.295 --> 13:59.423
A pretty puzzlement for our friends
at Ireland Yard.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.467
Toodle-loo, old boy.

15:03.821 --> 15:06.365
Good gracious, sir.
What's happened to you?

15:06.865 --> 15:08.200
I don't know.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.202
Who are you, sir?

15:10.369 --> 15:11.703
Who am I?

15:11.870 --> 15:14.540
I better get you to the Batcave at once.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.874
Batcave?

15:16.041 --> 15:19.044
Yes. You know, the Londinium Batcave.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.547
Whatever's happened to Master Robin?

15:21.713 --> 15:22.798
Robin?

15:23.215 --> 15:25.926
Well, never mind that.
We'll talk about that later.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.846
Now, you just get into this car.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.681
Come on.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.516
That's it.

15:33.142 --> 15:35.227
I'll drive.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.192
It appears, sir, that you're suffering
from a severe loss of memory.

15:42.359 --> 15:46.780
Fortunately, however,
I packed the Recollection Cycle Bat Restorer...

15:46.947 --> 15:48.991
...for this little overseas trip.

15:49.158 --> 15:51.410
Now, sit down, sir.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.705
It won't take a minute.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.208
Here we go.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.551
I don't know about this.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.053
You may hear a bit of a buzzing at first.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.352
Aah! Of course. I remember everything now.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.313
You're Alfred, I'm Batman.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.065
But what could have happened to Robin?

16:22.232 --> 16:24.651
I remember leaving him
in front of that pub...

16:24.818 --> 16:27.738
...to guard the boat
with Barnaby Street's materials.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.073
There was no boat by that dock, sir.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.241
Yes, I remember.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.870
I remember not seeing the boat,
I remember not seeing Robin, I re--

16:35.037 --> 16:36.371
Possibly he's got in touch...

16:36.538 --> 16:39.041
...with Commissioner Gordon
at venerable Ireland Yard.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.920
Good thinking, Alfred. I'll place a call
right now to Superintendent Watson.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.589
Sure, and it was a fine flight I had over.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.717
And it's a beautiful city you have here too,
superintendent.

16:48.884 --> 16:52.137
I'm only sorry I have to turn right around
and go back home.

16:52.304 --> 16:55.057
Better for you to convey the minutes
of the last meeting...

16:55.224 --> 16:59.269
...to Mayor Linseed in person, Chief O'Hara,
rather than trust them to the mails.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.772
I can't argue about that, commissioner.

17:01.939 --> 17:04.441
There's nothing like an Irish carrier pigeon.

17:13.325 --> 17:17.579
Venerable Ireland Yard.
Superintendent Watson here.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.415
Oh, hello, Batman. Oh, yes, of course.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.962
-It's for you, commissioner.
-Yes, Batman?

17:25.127 --> 17:30.175
That perfidious Lord Ffogg trapped me
in the Three Bells pub, commissioner.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.637
While, somehow, the boat for the dominion's
mysteriously vanished.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.222
The boat vanished?

17:35.389 --> 17:38.684
With its cargo of mini cloth'?

17:38.850 --> 17:41.853
I'll get the river patrol on it immediately.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.356
Along with Robin?

17:44.523 --> 17:47.651
No, Batman, I haven't heard a word from him.
But are you all right?

17:47.818 --> 17:48.944
Never better.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.946
I'll get back to you.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.494
Nothing.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.705
Nothing.

18:00.289 --> 18:02.374
How did you find me, Alfred?

18:02.541 --> 18:04.543
It concerns Batgirl, sir.

18:04.710 --> 18:09.881
Uh, she's discovered that the finishing school
at Ffogg Manor is for girl criminals.

18:10.048 --> 18:13.010
She's now investigating
the super-secret Cricket Pavilion there.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.553
She thought you ought to know.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.015
- But how did you--?
-And to answer your first question, sir...

18:18.181 --> 18:23.186
...I tracked you to the dock area
by the Batmobile Bat-tracking Device.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.396
Good show, Alfred.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.940
About Batgirl...

18:30.694 --> 18:35.282
Ah. So she really is a Batgirl.

18:35.449 --> 18:39.745
Still paralyzed by that paralyzing gas
you turned off, Lady Peasoup.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.955
She'll recover shortly.

18:42.122 --> 18:46.877
And when she does, perhaps
she should find herself in the dungeon...

18:47.044 --> 18:50.047
...with her young male counterpart, Robin.

18:50.213 --> 18:53.592
- You ogress, you vixen.
-Heh. Yes.

18:54.217 --> 18:58.055
Well, the dungeon
is immediately below our gallery.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.432
Ladies first.

19:07.481 --> 19:11.568
That must be His Lordship.
He's the only one who knows this number.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.155
Hello, Marmaduke? Where are you?

19:15.364 --> 19:17.449
At my club in Bleet Street, Penelope.

19:17.616 --> 19:20.285
Did you get that mini material
off the Barnaby Street boat?

19:20.452 --> 19:23.121
No. All we got was the Boy Wonder.

19:23.288 --> 19:26.708
He cut the hawsers on the boat
and it drifted down the river.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.462
What are you doing in Cricket Pavilion?
I tried every phone at Ffogg Place.

19:30.629 --> 19:33.382
I'm putting him and Batgirl in the dungeon.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.966
Batgirl?

19:35.133 --> 19:38.178
<i>Bats come in both sexes, Marmaduke.</i>

19:38.345 --> 19:43.809
And this female of the specie
broke into your treasure trove.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.811
What happened with Batman?

19:45.977 --> 19:47.145
We've taken care of him.

19:47.312 --> 19:50.148
But I have a much better idea for Robin
than that dungeon.

19:53.819 --> 19:57.656
All right, Alfred,
I'll respect your reticence concerning Batgirl.

19:57.823 --> 19:58.824
Thank you, sir.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.160
- Finding Robin is the first order of the day.
-The Batcomputer, sir.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.121
We have no choice.

20:07.124 --> 20:08.208
There.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.920
<i>“Wench.</i>

20:12.170 --> 20:14.297
Wench.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.842
Wunch."

20:17.008 --> 20:18.552
It doesn't make sense, Alfred.

20:18.719 --> 20:23.056
Well, perhaps in moving,
the Batcomputer is a bit off-kilter, sir.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.356
"Winch."

20:31.523 --> 20:33.150
It still doesn't make sense.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.443
It may, sir.

20:34.609 --> 20:40.991
The most prominent winch in Londinium
is in the winch room inside the Tower Bridge...

20:41.158 --> 20:45.746
...which operates the mechanism which raises
the arms of the bridge to let ships through.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.040
Which wind you to death
when the next ship comes along.

20:49.207 --> 20:53.044
Torturer, sadist.
You're worse than your sister.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.506
A high compliment. Well, let's go outside
and watch the Boy Wonder die.

20:56.673 --> 21:00.385
- Pip-pip, chin-chin, cheerio. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.438
<i>NARRATOR". As an approaching ship
starts activating Tower Bridge...</i>

21:11.605 --> 21:15.233
<i>...Robin has good reason to look horrified.</i>

21:32.918 --> 21:35.587
If that ship gets closer to that bridge,
Robin's done for.

21:35.754 --> 21:39.966
Quickly, Alfred, the Anti-Mechanical Batray
in the Bat-glove Compartment.

21:46.932 --> 21:51.186
To save his life, we'll have to zero the Bat-ray
in on the mechanical apparatus...

21:51.353 --> 21:53.146
...and render them useless.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.574
Something's happened.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.410
- The blooming bridge has stopped moving.
-Blimey.

22:07.577 --> 22:10.580
Oh, we'd better get back
to the winch room, governor.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.624
Tally-ho, away we go.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.128
- Batman. How'd you get here?
-Down a bascule.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.172
- Bascule?
-Yes, an escapement in which...

22:19.339 --> 22:21.925
...the detent is mounted on a pivotal axis.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.986
The Dynamic Destroyer.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.947
About to destroy you, Lord Ffogg.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.567
That pipe.

24:02.734 --> 24:03.985
Exactly, Batman.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.488
My pipe of fog.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.245
<i>NARRATOR".
What's this?</i>

24:14.412 --> 24:18.833
<i>Batman and Robin fogbound
in the winch room of Tower Bridge?</i>

24:19.376 --> 24:24.881
<i>And Batgirl still paralyzed by paralyzing fog
in the dungeon of Ffogg Place?</i>

24:25.048 --> 24:26.841
<i>By Jove, it's disturbing.</i>

24:27.008 --> 24:28.677
<i>By Jove, it's exciting.</i>

24:28.843 --> 24:31.054
<i>By Jove, it's mystifying.</i>

24:31.221 --> 24:33.765
<i>By Jove, watch the next episode.</i>

24:33.932 --> 24:35.976
<i>By Jove.</i>
