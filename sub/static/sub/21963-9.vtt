WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.019
Leroy, I'm gonna ask you
a question,

00:19.053 --> 00:20.821
-and I want you to be honest
with me.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.523
When you told me to stab
the underside

00:22.556 --> 00:24.392
-of that squid creature...

00:24.425 --> 00:25.993
...did you know the ink sac

00:26.026 --> 00:27.995
-No.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.830
-No.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.499
ANNIE:
Oh, did someone stab

00:31.532 --> 00:33.267
the underside of a squid

00:33.301 --> 00:34.435
Okay, is this
one of those things

00:34.468 --> 00:35.769
everyone knows not to do

00:35.803 --> 00:37.538
-LEROY: Yep.
-Come with me.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.108
Oh. All right.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.376
Looks good on you.
Let me see.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.012
-I look like I murdered a Smurf.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.781
Actually, it's kind of burning.
Is that weird?

00:47.815 --> 00:50.017
Well, it's poison, so...

00:50.050 --> 00:52.520
Are you serious?
-Don't worry about it.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.555
*

00:57.558 --> 01:00.461
Gather up,
everyone.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.862
The, uh...

01:01.895 --> 01:04.732
What is it?
The-the-the Gila Forest,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.567
a... uh...

01:06.600 --> 01:08.736
the Gila Forest in New Mexico.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.739
A hiker claimed that his friend
was snatched off the ground

01:11.772 --> 01:14.808
and ripped into the woods
by "something."

01:14.842 --> 01:18.879
The Gila Snatcher!
Sorry. I'm-I'm just excited.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.149
Yes, Annie has been following
the disappearances in the Gila

01:21.182 --> 01:23.717
for quite some time,
and even though

01:23.751 --> 01:25.553
there have been no
confirmed sightings

01:25.586 --> 01:27.488
and no clear indication of what
exactly is in those woods,

01:27.521 --> 01:30.324
she's, obviously,
given it a name.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.592
The Gila Snatcher.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.994
I was calling it
the Snatch Monster,

01:34.027 --> 01:37.231
but then I changed that
for obvious reasons.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.733
Hey, uh, Captain LaFrey,
if you're sending me and Leroy

01:39.767 --> 01:42.069
out to investigate,
we should take Annie.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.472
Since she's an expert
on the Snatch Monsters.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.842
Good idea, Max.
Annie, you'll go.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.077
Everyone, get to work.
Thank you.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.912
-Yes. All right.
-Yes.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.014
-MAX: * Going on a road trip. *
-Max.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.116
Sure.
-A word, please.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.086
You wanted Annie coming with us
as an expert, right?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.821
Yeah. What other reason
would there be?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.122
I can't think of one.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.657
On an unrelated note,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.826
I was thinking about this
hypothetical agent,

02:05.859 --> 02:07.761
I'll call him Matt.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.530
He tried taking on

02:09.563 --> 02:11.465
a dangerous case
while simultaneously

02:11.499 --> 02:13.534
working to impress this girl

02:13.567 --> 02:15.603
he was super into, even though
he would never say it.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.706
-Right.
-And his split focus

02:18.739 --> 02:20.308
made the whole thing
blow up in his face.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.010
Ooh.
-And kill his partner,

02:23.043 --> 02:25.012
-Me-Roy.
-Me-Roy.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.013
Also hypothetical.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.682
I am so sad for Matt
and Me-Roy--

02:28.716 --> 02:30.150
sound like great guys--

02:30.184 --> 02:34.222
but I can tell you
that Max is full force

02:34.255 --> 02:36.824
in the case, 100% focused.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.327
-And... I am 100% sure.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.730
I'm willing to go to 120%.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.232
I'm fine with 100%.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.668
ANNIE:
There are no known photographs,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.803
but local lore is that a large

02:49.837 --> 02:51.705
mammal-like creature
lives in the trees.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.374
Now, since I've been
studying this,

02:53.407 --> 02:55.309
seven people have gone missing,

02:55.343 --> 02:57.345
-just in the last three years.
-Yeah, the hiker's buddy said

02:57.378 --> 02:59.513
he was just lifted up
off the ground and disappeared.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.482
I mean, what kind of creature
does that?

03:01.515 --> 03:04.318
Oz monkeys.
Those evil flying monkeys

03:04.352 --> 03:06.019
from The Wizard of Oz?
They could do that.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.222
Are you suggesting
those are real, or...?

03:08.256 --> 03:10.157
No, I'm saying
they could do that.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.725
I've seen it with my own eyes.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.993
You mean, you've seen
The Wizard of Oz?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.528
-Correct.
-Got it.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.096
Well, I can say with confidence
we are not dealing

03:16.129 --> 03:18.599
-with Oz monkeys here.
-That's good to hear.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.900
I got to say, though, I do find

03:19.933 --> 03:22.169
their little bellhop uniforms
amusing.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.439
Little evil flying monkey in
a little hat, little coat.

03:25.473 --> 03:26.607
You think they wear that
by choice,

03:26.640 --> 03:28.008
or does the witch make them
dress up?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.377
The witch totally makes them
dress up.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.279
Freaky witch.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.014
So, the most disturbing thing
is, every so often,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.616
one of the hikers turns up...

03:35.649 --> 03:39.287
in pieces, shredded,

03:39.320 --> 03:42.089
-with teeth marks.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.857
Sorry. It's a hobby.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.626
But this area is no joke.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.596
I mean, the Gila Forest
is rough terrain.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.432
What do you mean
"rough terrain"?

03:51.465 --> 03:54.234
Oh, I'm talking big,
nasty woods.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.373
-Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.941
Yeah, no, I love the woods.

04:00.974 --> 04:04.144
As a kid, people called me
James Woods.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.280
-They used to call you
James Woods? -They sure did.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.782
Because I loved the woods
so much, and I looked older.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.925
-I'm gonna go try
and find a signal. -Okay.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.461
See you later.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.963
Leroy, listen, I have to
tell you something.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.898
No one's ever called me
James Woods.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.967
I'm confused.
I was under the impression

04:27.000 --> 04:29.403
they called you James Woods
based on your love of the woods.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.772
That's just it.
I don't love the woods.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.273
In fact, I hate the woods.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.676
Oh. No, Max.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.110
I'm out of my element.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.612
I mean, out in the woods,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.013
trying to focus on a case

04:40.047 --> 04:42.115
-in addition to...

04:42.149 --> 04:43.651
-Well, no. No, no.
-No, no, no. You trailed off.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.986
-Okay. In addition to trying

04:46.019 --> 04:48.489
-to impress Annie. Fine.
Okay -There it is.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.090
That's what I was talking about
back at the Bureau.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.959
-Yeah.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.160
-That was us!
-Well, circumstances

04:53.193 --> 04:55.763
have changed, Me

04:55.796 --> 04:57.331
-I don't know what to do here,
man. -Calm down.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.499
-No, no, Max.
-I don't know what to do.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.001
Relax, okay? I got us.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.703
I used to be a Eagle Scout.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.872
-Was an Eagle Scout.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.040
I can handle this.
All you have to do

05:07.074 --> 05:08.676
is act as if.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.210
As if?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.212
Act as if you cool.
Act as if you fearless.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.182
Act as if you a damn
woodland master.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.718
And act it so hard,
you start to believe it.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.187
-Then Annie will, too.
-Yeah.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.022
-I like that. That's cool.
-Yeah.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.724
All right, I'll grab Annie.
You wait here,

05:23.757 --> 05:27.995
and get any last nerdy impulses
out of your system.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.330
-Yeah.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.235
Ooh, binoculars.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.571
Well, Leroy,
who's the nerd now?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.644
Oh.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.415
Ah, father and son in the woods,
how sweet.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.390
Uh...

05:56.424 --> 05:58.058
It's headed straight
for those people.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.760
Leroy! Annie!

06:06.434 --> 06:08.368
What's his name?

06:08.402 --> 06:10.438
Barry, what are you doing here?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.772
I saw you in the meeting.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.140
What's his name?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.910
Don't play this game with me,
Ava, not with me.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.512
You've been distant all week.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.380
You've not been yourself.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.615
Shouldn't you be doing
an autopsy?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.283
And I'm doing one.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.753
Open up that chest cavity
and let me see that heart.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.755
Barry, the remains
of the Gila victim

06:27.788 --> 06:29.356
could yield valuable
information...

06:29.389 --> 06:31.258
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.060
-Leave.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.928
As in Schreiber?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.263
As in "leave now."

06:36.296 --> 06:38.098
Okay, I'm going.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.468
But one piece of advice,
keep it "HOT."

06:40.501 --> 06:42.970
Listen to me, it's an acronym.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.806
Honest, Open,
Two-way communication.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.275
-Get out.
-Sorry. Okay.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.950
Anybody out there?!

06:56.984 --> 06:58.385
Where are you?
Are you here?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.920
What is it

06:59.953 --> 07:01.655
A dad and a kid.
I don't know where they went.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.256
There...
Something was watching 'em

07:03.290 --> 07:04.992
from the trees, like a,
like a bat,

07:05.025 --> 07:07.728
but, uh, the

07:07.761 --> 07:08.729
You saw Batman?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.631
No, not Batman.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.600
It was, like, something
that resembled a bat,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.802
but, like, big, like a man.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.270
-What I'm hearing is Batman.
-No, it wasn't Batman, Leroy.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.606
Well, it sounds like bat
and man, right?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.140
Yeah, but I didn't
say them together.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.642
You say them together,
it's a whole different thing.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.410
-It's Batman.
-Max, if you saw the Gila--

07:23.443 --> 07:25.579
I mean, if that is, in fact,

07:25.613 --> 07:27.815
what you saw--
it would be the first

07:27.848 --> 07:29.082
truly confirmed sighting.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.283
We should head back

07:30.317 --> 07:31.952
to the car, get our equipment.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.220
Yeah, good idea.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.823
Leroy, where are you going?

07:35.856 --> 07:36.990
The car is this way.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.192
-Car is back this way.
-No.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.629
-Car is this way.
-We just came from this way.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.164
No, no, no. I could've sworn
it was around this way.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.634
Um... what?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.869
-Guys...

07:48.902 --> 07:51.138
are we stupid enough
to be lost already?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.879
Okay, we didn't run too far.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.648
Let's just go my way
for a few minutes,

08:00.681 --> 08:02.149
see if we run into the car.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.284
-It won't take long.
-Unless your way takes us

08:04.317 --> 08:06.554
further into the woods,
getting us even more lost.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.488
Oh, my God. We're lost?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.390
We don't have any food.
We have no shelter.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.192
The darkness is coming

08:12.225 --> 08:13.661
by the minute,
and this landscape

08:13.694 --> 08:15.529
was made to kill us.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.330
:
Act as if.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.465
Act as if.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.800
: As if?
-As if.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.034
-As if. Yeah, yeah.
-As if.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.369
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.637
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

08:23.671 --> 08:25.205
I wouldn't want it
any other way.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.207
-No.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.910
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I'm not worried. Not at all.

08:29.943 --> 08:33.513
In fact, I got into science
because I was bored

08:33.547 --> 08:36.483
of solving forest problems
like this.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.885
No biggie.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.386
So great out here, right?

08:39.419 --> 08:40.487
It's beautiful and stuff?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.189
It's just...

08:42.222 --> 08:43.323
It's perfect.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.324
-Trees.
-Right.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.859
Trees. You got trees.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.695
I mean, I see it

08:47.728 --> 08:49.830
as the most beautiful challenge,
if that makes sense?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.599
Like, I just look at it,
and I'm just like,

08:51.632 --> 08:54.367
"Bring it on, bro." You know?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.903
LEROY:
Man.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.606
I was frightened at first,
but now, 'cause of you,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.641
I'm... feel safe.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.351
Okay, so, it worked.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.620
-Your advice.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.588
Keep it HOT.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.389
Open the floodgates.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.959
I tried it with him,
and it worked.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.260
So it is a him.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.895
-Yes, Barry. It's a him.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.198
It's a man.
A man that I kept pushing away

09:25.232 --> 09:27.200
until you stepped in.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.269
Glad I could help.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.872
You know, I guess
it's kind of a... a pattern

09:31.905 --> 09:35.542
with me, this-this pushing men
away thing, you know?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.878
I-I look for the smallest excuse
to end it.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.280
If he's, you know,
wearing too many Henleys,

09:40.313 --> 09:43.250
if he uses the word "delicious"
to describe an experience,

09:43.283 --> 09:44.752
or he won't open the car door.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.119
When a man doesn't open
the car door...

09:46.153 --> 09:47.921
Nice shot.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.389
Can we play tic

09:49.422 --> 09:50.791
Yeah, but I get
the first two moves, remember.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.760
-MAX: All right.
I get center square. -Okay.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.461
We need a plan.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.096
It's getting dark,
and we have no equipment.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.230
MAX:
That's correct.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.066
Yeah. Uh, the plan...

09:59.099 --> 10:00.500
It's being formulated,

10:00.533 --> 10:03.270
and, uh, it's super good.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.072
Great, but we need
some specifics.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.439
So, what do we do?

10:06.473 --> 10:08.942
Right. Um...

10:08.976 --> 10:10.510
Well, the, uh...

10:10.543 --> 10:13.113
:
We need the specifics.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.448
Specifics?
The specifics of the plan

10:15.482 --> 10:16.817
-are to stay put.
-That's right.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.852
-Like you said. Max said...
-Right.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.521
"If you're lost in the woods,
the best move is to stay put,

10:21.554 --> 10:23.590
and then somebody
will come looking for you."

10:23.623 --> 10:25.358
-But no one's looking for us.
-Not now.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.494
But as it gets darker,

10:27.527 --> 10:29.262
you know, they'll see the car
parked there in the dark,

10:29.296 --> 10:30.630
they'll call search and rescue.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.465
Search and rescue
will come looking for us,

10:32.499 --> 10:33.867
and they'll find us
'cause we stayed put.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.535
That's the plan.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.004
ANNIE:
All right, well,

10:37.037 --> 10:38.706
-I guess that sounds...
-Weak.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.443
Your plan is weak.
You have a weak plan.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.313
You mean your plan
that you told me. -Yeah.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.281
That's right.
Just hearing it out loud,

10:48.315 --> 10:49.649
coming out of your mouth,

10:49.683 --> 10:51.551
it sounds weak.
It sounds passive.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.221
I grew up as an Eagle Scout.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.989
-Like, I was an Eagle Scout.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.791
Yes, I sure was.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.827
You want specifics?
How about this?

10:59.860 --> 11:02.662
Follow me. I know my way out.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.397
-It's right through here.
-All right.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.498
No, sorry.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.400
It's... Whoops.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.336
It's right over this way.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.871
Am I just putting up walls?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.572
Erecting a-a barrier

11:12.605 --> 11:15.342
to fence in my heart,
seclude my soul?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.211
I mean, do I even really know
what love is?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.848
Well, that feels
like a natural stopping point.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.416
And it's not like I just
hold back emotionally.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.318
It's-it's physically, too.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.887
Not sexually.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.590
I'm quite satiated sexually,
but sensually, I'm starved.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.691
Enough!

11:31.725 --> 11:33.861
I can't take it anymore.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.063
-You need closure.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.597
We're gonna call your ex.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.270
-You said you knew the way.
-I thought I did.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.872
I swear I thought I did.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.407
I was really buying into
my own fake sense

11:47.440 --> 11:49.276
of self-confidence, I guess.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.880
But if we just keep walking,
we'll eventually

11:55.749 --> 11:57.617
It feels like we've been walking
for an hour.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.619
That's right. It does. Uh...

11:59.652 --> 12:02.055
That's 'cause
in the forest, like,

12:02.089 --> 12:04.892
time slows down, w...
because of the moon

12:04.925 --> 12:07.294
-and dehydration and stuff.
-Trees. Wind.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.296
And the trees... and leaves...

12:09.329 --> 12:11.031
Max, what pointed you
in this direction?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.699
-'Cause you never said.
-MAX: Yeah.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.635
I mean, you just said
you knew the way out, but how?

12:15.668 --> 12:19.072
Knew it. Knew it by the...
the stars and stuff.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.974
You... This way?
When we were going there?

12:21.008 --> 12:23.811
It was, like, woodland,
like, expert...

12:23.844 --> 12:25.578
master stuff.
It's hard to explain.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.314
Okay, so, it's starting to sound
like you actually don't know

12:27.347 --> 12:29.082
where we are
or where we're going

12:29.116 --> 12:30.450
or the slightest idea...

12:30.483 --> 12:31.785
Um, guys?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.322
Oh, my God.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.460
Ew.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.299
Oh, that is human.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.235
It's picked clean.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.769
It must have done this.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.005
You mean... Batman?

12:52.039 --> 12:53.673
-I didn't say Batman, Leroy.
-Yes, you did.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.742
I said it was bat-like
and the size of a man.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.177
That's the description
of Batman.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.611
You want me to describe
Batman for you?

12:58.645 --> 12:59.746
You've been describing him
all day.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.948
I don't need to hear it again.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.115
It doesn't matter
what you want to call it.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.450
-MAX: ...in Gotham.
-Shh!

13:03.483 --> 13:04.918
You hear that?

13:04.952 --> 13:06.786
I hear it,

13:06.820 --> 13:09.689
but I don't see it.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.691
Me neither.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.497
Guys.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.268
Stay very still and quiet.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.237
I think I see eyes.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.916
Run!

13:39.052 --> 13:41.521
*

13:44.391 --> 13:45.959
Oz monkeys! It's the Oz monkeys!

13:45.993 --> 13:47.394
-ANNIE: We need to find cover.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.096
There!

13:56.769 --> 13:58.338
-It's locked.
-I'll hold him off!

13:59.372 --> 14:01.341
-It's coming!

14:06.213 --> 14:08.381
-I don't know.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.849
It was right behind me.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.752
I think I hear something.

14:12.785 --> 14:13.753
That was my tummy.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.024
-She's not happy.
-Wow.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.926
We just escaped the bat monster,
and now we have to contend

14:18.959 --> 14:21.895
with the gurgle monster.
Right?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.668
Okay.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.670
What the hell, Max?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.605
You were lying this whole time?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.807
Just putting all of us in
danger

14:36.876 --> 14:37.945
MAX:
I don't know.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.079
I'm sorry.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.217
Look, I just,
I wanted to impress you, okay?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.352
'Cause I like you.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.154
All right?

14:48.821 --> 14:50.790
Wow.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.226
I thought the weight of fear
and terror

14:53.260 --> 14:55.562
would overwhelm
anything awkward, but...

14:55.595 --> 14:57.564
I was wrong.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.732
This is real, real awkward.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.236
What's that?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.771
A flashlight.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.739
Flashlight

15:11.979 --> 15:13.246
His.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.682
Gross.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.053
LEROY:
Damn.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.389
He was probably hiking when
Batman must've come after him,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.491
and he ran in here
to try to wait it out.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.994
-And starved to death.
-Wait, he's a hiker,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.861
and he didn't come here
with any food or supplies?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.778
There. A backpack. You guys.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.780
He must've dropped it running
from that thing.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.582
-Backpack.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.850
-It's out there.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.919
-I just got to... No, no.
-Here, twist it.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.287
-You hit it, you hit it.
-Twist. Why would...

15:54.321 --> 15:56.156
-why would they make it, why
would they make it... -I know...

15:56.189 --> 15:58.258
-You hit it. You twisted it.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.293
Oh, I twisted it
Check this out.

16:06.899 --> 16:10.037
-Ava!
-Steven, let me get this out.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.871
You can do this. Stay strong.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.042
I can't keep letting
my relationships get

16:15.075 --> 16:17.044
dragged down under the weight
of our past.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.478
I have to let you go.

16:18.511 --> 16:23.016
Wow. Well, I'm... proud of you.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.186
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.821
Sorry, Steven, can you give us
a second? It's Barry here.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.857
-Just a minute.
Oh.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.461
Are you sure about this?
He seems kind of great.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.230
-Do we want
to give him a second chance?

16:37.264 --> 16:39.899
I can hear you guys. And
for the record, I'm up for it.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.502
No, no, no. B-Barry,
I'm done listening to you.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.538
And, Steven,
I am done running back to you.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.141
-Okay...
-Go finish your autopsy.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.742
Well, I just did.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.882
*

16:57.784 --> 17:00.387
Guys, listen,
we can't wait this out.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.222
If we can get to that backpack,

17:02.255 --> 17:05.024
maybe he had a satellite phone
or a radio.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.927
We can't just run out there.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.763
No, but it's been quiet
for, like, an hour.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.499
I mean, maybe it's sleeping
or something.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.401
Or maybe it's lying in wait,

17:14.434 --> 17:17.036
all quiet and still,

17:17.070 --> 17:18.771
just waiting on one of us
to poke our head out

17:18.805 --> 17:20.940
so it can snatch us up
like an Oz monkey on Toto.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.376
Okay, terrific.
So what are we gonna do?

17:23.410 --> 17:25.878
Uh, go for plan B
like our friend over here?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.381
No, you guys,

17:28.415 --> 17:31.184
we are not going down like that.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.521
That pack is our best hope,
maybe our last hope.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.456
So what do you say?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.861
Great. Okay,

17:41.894 --> 17:44.264
now you're talking. So, uh,
all right, who's gonna...

17:44.297 --> 17:46.299
who's gonna go out there
and get it?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.302
It's me, isn't it?

17:49.336 --> 17:50.537
Yes.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.139
Yeah. 'Cause it was my idea?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.741
-Definitely. -All the dumbass
stuff I did today

17:54.774 --> 17:56.543
-to get us stuck out here.
-Mm-hmm. -All of that.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.380
-Yeah. -Yeah, no, that's great.
That's fair. I-I get that.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.121
Okay, when Leroy opens the door,
you just take off, stay low,

18:08.155 --> 18:10.257
grab the bag,
and haul ass back here.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.591
Okay.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.592
-Yeah.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.862
One, two, three.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.499
*

18:21.934 --> 18:24.103
LEROY:
Go, go, go!

18:29.008 --> 18:30.943
MAX:
Okay.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.481
-No sat phone, no radio.
-None of this helps.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.916
Not one thing.
But you put these together...

18:36.949 --> 18:38.651
Camping fuel, batteries,
weather radio,

18:38.685 --> 18:40.853
location module, car key remote.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.122
Yeah, I can build
an explosive device.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.458
Can you also build a bazooka
to fire this device?

18:45.492 --> 18:47.294
'Cause you can't just hand
a bomb to the bat thing

18:47.327 --> 18:48.395
and say, "Here you go."

18:49.462 --> 18:52.565
Maybe we can.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.206
Does it seem a tiny bit wrong
to do this to this poor guy?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.875
A chance for payback?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.477
I think it's what
he would have wanted.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.479
Okay, once you get that thing
to take the bait,

19:06.513 --> 19:08.948
I'm gonna click this
and it will blow, okay?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.884
Great. So all I have to do is

19:11.918 --> 19:14.521
run outside, wearing a dead guy
like a fox fur stole

19:14.554 --> 19:16.456
in order to trick a bat monster
into thinking

19:16.489 --> 19:18.391
that he's getting a live meal.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.893
And hope that your little
MacGyver backpack bomb

19:20.927 --> 19:22.362
doesn't go off
while I'm still carrying it.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.730
All right, well, don't worry,

19:23.763 --> 19:25.198
MacGyver's got nothing
on MacMax.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.468
-Yeah. That's right.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.737
Why didn't you go with
"MaxGyver"? So much better.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.505
Oh, yeah.
How did I miss that?

19:32.539 --> 19:34.173
Annie, you sure about this?

19:34.207 --> 19:35.842
The chance
for an up close encounter

19:35.875 --> 19:37.544
with the Gila Snatcher?

19:37.577 --> 19:39.178
How could I pass that up?

19:39.212 --> 19:42.582
LEROY/MAX:
One, two, three, go!

19:44.917 --> 19:46.886
ANNIE: Oh, my God,
what is wrong with me?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.191
Come on, you son of a bitch!

19:54.060 --> 19:56.162
-Oh! -Go!

19:56.195 --> 19:57.697
-Come on! Come back!
-Come on, come on, come on!

19:57.730 --> 20:00.600
-Come back! Go, go,
go, go, go, go! -Come on!

20:04.304 --> 20:05.372
-Yes!

20:05.405 --> 20:07.274
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

20:07.307 --> 20:09.242
-Yes! Oh!
-Eat it! You ain't no Batman!

20:09.276 --> 20:11.244
-Eat it!
-Yes! Yes!

20:14.814 --> 20:17.183
-No way. No way! Oh.
-Uh-huh. Sure.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.185
-No way! No...
-Yes.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.687
-Sorry, I'm just extremely
impressed. -Yeah, by the time

20:20.720 --> 20:22.355
we all got up on our feet
and looked out,

20:22.389 --> 20:24.957
-it was sunrise.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.427
Any real Eagle Scout knows
spiders always build webs

20:27.460 --> 20:29.228
on the south side
of trees, so...

20:29.262 --> 20:31.130
I was able
to get us out of there.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.433
-Oh. -Plus, there was
a compass in the backpack.

20:33.466 --> 20:37.136
-That, too.
-Oh, fantastic, just fantastic.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.439
Well, I had a very interesting
evening here myself.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.607
Did you?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.642
No, it was...
bland and uneventful.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.212
: It wasn't.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.114
-Yeah. Come on.
-I love juicy gossip.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.751
-Ugh. -You're not gonna
believe what happened.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.556
It's... man.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.791
Anyway...

20:58.825 --> 21:01.127
-I just wanted to,
like, apologize... -No.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.462
-You don't have to say anything.
-Well, I mean,

21:02.495 --> 21:03.830
-come on.
-Really, don't.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.933
-Okay.
-Honestly, after what you said,

21:06.966 --> 21:10.169
I felt great.
I felt really happy.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.271
-Yeah, but, um,

21:12.305 --> 21:14.407
I have so much stuff
that I have to figure out.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.343
-Sure.
-And you have some things

21:16.376 --> 21:17.777
-to figure out, too.
-Totally.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.179
Once that's all dealt with,
though, I...

21:20.212 --> 21:23.149
Um... maybe.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.951
-Maybe.
-So...

21:24.984 --> 21:27.286
-Cool.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.655
Oh, Annie.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.658
Just one more thing, uh...

21:33.326 --> 21:35.662
Good job
blowing up that monster.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.231
Thanks.
