WEBVTT

00:09.661 --> 00:10.793
What do we got?

00:10.836 --> 00:13.752
ID says his name
is Zahid Hassan.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.580
Looks like he took
three shots to the chest.

00:15.624 --> 00:18.279
Probably was dead
before he hit the ground.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.412
- Any witnesses?
- Got a driver
who says he got into it

00:21.456 --> 00:22.631
with an SUV
down the block.

00:22.674 --> 00:23.980
They get a plate?
Nope.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.112
All right, we'll take it
from here. Thanks.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.417
You got it.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.812
Bags say "Punjabi Kitchen."

00:29.855 --> 00:31.944
You think it's another case
of road rage?

00:31.988 --> 00:33.424
Walks like it, but

00:33.468 --> 00:35.600
only way to be sure
is check surveillance cameras

00:35.644 --> 00:37.646
in the area, and let's check
these red light cams,

00:37.689 --> 00:40.127
- just in case.
Zahid?!

00:40.170 --> 00:41.737
- Zahid!?
- Hey, stop them!

00:41.780 --> 00:43.739
Zahid? Zahid... Stop-- hey, stop them!

00:43.782 --> 00:44.957
Ma'am, stay back.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.089
Who are you?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.960
Um, I'm Amir.
This is my mom, Maya.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.832
Is that my husband?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.617
Tell me he's okay.
Please, tell me he's okay!

00:52.661 --> 00:54.010
Well, how did you know
where he was?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.446
I-I tracked his phone.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.231
- Let me see him.
- Please,

00:57.274 --> 00:59.276
let me see his face.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.104
I'm sorry.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.715
No. No, no....

01:03.759 --> 01:05.978
- No!
- It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

01:10.374 --> 01:11.854
Hey.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.116
Uncle Jamie.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.770
Whoa, hey. What are you
doing up here, Sean?

01:14.813 --> 01:17.164
I was actually kind of hoping
to run something by you.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.296
Uh, you in some
kind of jam?

01:19.340 --> 01:20.558
Because I can't... No. No, no, no.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.125
It's-it's nothing like that.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.388
I've got this, uh, sociology
project coming up for school...

01:24.432 --> 01:26.608
Uh-huh....and I wanted to do it
on women in the workplace.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.131
Why don't you go ask
Aunt Erin about it?

01:28.175 --> 01:30.655
I was kind of hoping to do it
on Aunt Eddie and her partner.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.309
- Mm-hmm.
- Kind of like
a two for one, you know?

01:32.353 --> 01:33.702
What, do you want
to interview them?

01:33.745 --> 01:35.617
Yeah, and I was also
kind of hoping

01:35.660 --> 01:37.140
I'd do a ride-along.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.316
Whoa, I-I don't know, Sean.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.622
Hear me out.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.363
It's a first-hand look

01:42.406 --> 01:45.757
at what it's like for
two female cops in the field,

01:45.801 --> 01:47.498
from a guy's perspective.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.847
That's fresh.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.241
All right.
You ran this by your dad?

01:51.285 --> 01:52.329
Of course.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.461
And he's cool with it.

01:53.504 --> 01:54.940
Yeah, but...

01:54.984 --> 01:56.855
if you don't think it's
a good idea, I-I can find

01:56.899 --> 01:58.988
- something else.
- It is. Let me just
talk to my captain.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.642
All right?
I seriously can't
thank you enough.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.557
All right. I'll, um,
I-I'll see you around.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.385
Okay.
Yeah.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.791
I got this.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.142
About time.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.144
I said I got it,
not that I'm paying for it.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.929
I should've skipped my coffee
and made a clean getaway.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.539
Frankie.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.542
The other shoe, Lenny.

02:31.586 --> 02:32.674
It's not like that.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.328
It's always like that.

02:34.371 --> 02:37.722
I ever mention my cousin Steve
who owns the Miami Dolphins?

02:37.766 --> 02:39.550
The Miami Dolphins.
Mm.

02:39.594 --> 02:41.204
I'm pretty sure
I would've remembered.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.597
Well, we're distant cousins,

02:42.640 --> 02:44.120
but we've gotten close
over the years.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.558
Well, whatever jam
Cousin Steve is in,

02:47.602 --> 02:49.430
it's out of my jurisdiction.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.736
He's not in a jam.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.564
He the guy paying for dinner?

02:53.608 --> 02:55.958
Yeah, but...'Cause I don't take bribes,

02:56.001 --> 02:58.134
if that's where this is going.

02:59.135 --> 03:02.399
Wow. So cynical.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.488
Come on, give me a break, Lenny.

03:05.315 --> 03:08.275
That's exactly why
I've invited you to dinner.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.190
To give you a break.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.367
Steve is paying for dinner

03:13.410 --> 03:15.847
because he wanted me
to carry this out personally.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.414
So in case you said no,

03:17.458 --> 03:19.721
there'd be no record
of the rejection.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.463
A rejection of what?

03:22.506 --> 03:24.682
The NFL wants you to be

03:24.726 --> 03:27.119
Senior Vice President
of Security.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.085
Come on,
you must have some questions.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.521
The money...

03:41.264 --> 03:43.658
Not my first question.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.012
Would I have to move?

03:51.143 --> 03:52.449
Really?

03:52.493 --> 03:55.060
Hey, my questions
are my questions.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.193
Their headquarters are
at Park and 52nd.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.195
So...

03:59.239 --> 04:02.154
I'd be working out of
their headquarters here.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.026
That is my understanding.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.291
So is this you, not saying no?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.250
Just gathering information.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.512
To then say no?

04:11.555 --> 04:14.515
It's a lot to take in, okay?

04:18.780 --> 04:22.174
You've given your life
to service, Frankie.

04:22.218 --> 04:25.308
You've helped so many people,
myself included.

04:25.352 --> 04:28.398
The one person
you still owe something to

04:28.442 --> 04:30.748
is sitting right across from me.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.694
Got the images back
from the red light cam.

05:03.738 --> 05:04.652
You get a plate?

05:04.695 --> 05:07.437
Nope. No plates, front or back.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.484
Hmm.

05:10.527 --> 05:11.702
Sounds premeditated.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.400
Maybe it's just
a case of road rage.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.227
No plates, gun in the vehicle...

05:15.271 --> 05:16.881
I don't think so.

05:16.925 --> 05:19.319
Could be some idiot took the
plates off to go drag racing.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.364
Drag racing in an SUV?

05:21.408 --> 05:24.280
Maybe in New Canaan,
not likely in New York.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.848
Besides, the other
red light cam shows that

05:26.891 --> 05:28.415
the SUV followed Zahid

05:28.458 --> 05:29.894
from the moment
he left the restaurant.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.113
Which is where we need to go.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.375
Who would put a hit out

05:32.419 --> 05:34.029
- on a food delivery guy?
- God only knows.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.379
But at this point...

05:36.423 --> 05:39.556
I have lost the capacity
to be surprised.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.779
And that drive-by
shooting on a food delivery guy?

05:44.822 --> 05:46.215
Turns out
it's not road rage

05:46.258 --> 05:47.564
after all.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.305
They're looking at a
contract hit of some kind.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.915
On a food delivery guy?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.787
I've thought it after
waiting for an hour and a half.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.005
Well, who hasn't?

05:54.049 --> 05:55.398
But actually thinking
about it and doing it?

05:55.442 --> 05:59.359
Is there a point where
nothing can surprise us?

05:59.402 --> 06:01.404
Or have we already
reached that point

06:01.448 --> 06:03.972
and never even noticed?

06:13.590 --> 06:15.418
Food for thought.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.595
Meanwhile, the <i>Times
has some follow-up questions</i>

06:18.639 --> 06:21.946
for you regarding the
police union's demands...

06:21.990 --> 06:24.209
I've been offered a job.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.871
A good job.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.265
Head of security with the NFL.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.183
And you're sharing this
with us because...

06:41.226 --> 06:42.967
You're thinking
of accepting it?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.492
I mean, there must be a hundred
offers you didn't share...

06:45.535 --> 06:48.712
I'm sharing it
in case I seem distracted.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.280
'Cause, full disclosure,

06:51.323 --> 06:54.109
I've been a lifelong
pro football fan,

06:54.152 --> 06:57.112
and the perks are
as good as the money.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.809
So I'd be lying if I said

06:58.853 --> 07:03.292
it just disappeared
from my mind.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.816
So... What else?

07:06.991 --> 07:09.690
Well, would you get
to pick your lieutenants

07:09.733 --> 07:11.518
in this new job?

07:13.824 --> 07:17.349
I imagine I would have
a say in the matter, yes.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.090
Well, I'm just saying,

07:19.134 --> 07:21.528
I could make myself
available.

07:21.571 --> 07:26.141
A new hire in that high-profile
an organization

07:26.184 --> 07:29.274
could do with
a well-executed rollout.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.409
I'll take it
under consideration.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.847
So...

07:36.891 --> 07:38.893
more to come.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.808
What else?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.941
Nice try.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.727
What?

07:46.770 --> 07:49.469
Like it's just because
you're a lifelong fan.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.603
No?

07:53.647 --> 07:57.389
Word is Erin is strongly
considering a run for DA.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.571
Well, that has nothing to do...

08:04.614 --> 08:06.877
It's got everything
to do with you.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.837
If she runs and
you're gone from this office,

08:09.880 --> 08:13.536
she's running on a legacy
in law enforcement.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.844
If she runs and
you're still in this office,

08:16.887 --> 08:19.977
it's running for a monopoly
on law enforcement.

08:23.546 --> 08:26.593
Gee. I never thought
of it that way.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.116
Yes, you did.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.945
That's what's "distracting" you.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.557
Well, since you put it
that way...

08:34.601 --> 08:36.603
Which everyone will.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.347
Thanks for reminding me.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.495
Same make, model, color.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.671
Wonder if it's the same year.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.502
Sorry, we're closed.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.025
You the owner?

09:12.029 --> 09:13.248
Excuse me.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.510
Detective Reagan;

09:14.554 --> 09:15.903
my partner,
Detective Baez.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.253
You mind answering a
few questions for us?

09:18.296 --> 09:19.602
Muhammed Qadir.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.778
- You're here about Zahid?
- He worked here, right?

09:21.822 --> 09:23.954
Yeah, I gave him a job
about three years ago.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.608
I can't believe he's gone.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.218
Were the two
of you friends?

09:27.262 --> 09:28.829
We were like brothers.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.265
He was always

09:30.308 --> 09:32.267
helping here with the
restaurant, and with my family.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.095
He was a good man.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.400
Sounds like a good man.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.272
There's a blue SUV out front.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.752
Do you know
who it belongs to?

09:38.795 --> 09:39.796
That's mine.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.363
Mind if I ask
what year it is?

09:41.406 --> 09:43.887
- 2017.
Hmm.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.587
Same as the vehicle
used in Zahid's murder.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.458
Same shade of blue, too.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.894
Where were you
the night Zahid was killed?

09:50.938 --> 09:52.635
What, you think I had something
to do with this?

09:52.679 --> 09:54.463
We didn't say that,
but did you?

09:54.506 --> 09:55.769
Okay.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.640
We're done talking now.
You can go.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.207
And you can settle down.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.426
We'll leave when you
- give us an alibi.
- No, screw you.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.124
You say you got a family?
Wife and kids?

10:03.167 --> 10:04.865
You don't give
us an alibi,

10:04.908 --> 10:06.301
they're gonna watch
you walk out of here

10:06.344 --> 10:07.694
in handcuffs on the news.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.349
Okay, I was here,
at the restaurant,

10:11.393 --> 10:12.437
working,
when Zahid was killed.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.004
Anyone who can
verify that?

10:14.048 --> 10:15.353
We have security cameras.

10:15.397 --> 10:16.964
Then you won't
mind showing us.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.719
You sleep here?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.940
Uh, only-only when I work late.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.596
Now go.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.903
Uh, you mind if
we search your vehicle?

10:55.045 --> 10:56.133
Thank you.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.787
Enjoy your lunch.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.703
I heard that.

11:00.747 --> 11:01.878
<i>So, uh,</i>

11:01.922 --> 11:04.228
what's it like for you guys?

11:04.272 --> 11:05.926
As-- as women.

11:07.754 --> 11:08.885
Tough.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.453
Real tough.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.629
Really?
Yeah.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.413
For one,
there's all the extra time

11:15.457 --> 11:16.893
we have to spend
on makeup in the morning.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.504
Yeah, at least,
like, 30 minutes.
Mm-hmm.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.245
30 minutes?
At least.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.900
Depends on how much fun
we had the night before.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.423
Yeah, and then we
gotta spend extra time

11:25.467 --> 11:27.904
trying to find a, you know,
a salad spot for lunch...

11:27.948 --> 11:29.340
- A salad spot?
- Yeah.

11:29.384 --> 11:30.472
These figures
are not going

11:30.515 --> 11:31.995
to keep themselves, Sean.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.910
We have got a job to do, and
we have to look good doing it.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.478
It's right there
in the Patrol Guide--

11:36.521 --> 11:37.784
"all female officers

11:37.827 --> 11:39.437
must look hot in uniform."

11:41.048 --> 11:42.789
It is?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.836
I-It's not. I don't...

11:49.360 --> 11:51.275
2-9 David, you have a 10-52,

11:51.319 --> 11:53.756
possible domestic disturbance
at the Bedford Houses.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.279
2-9 David,
show us responding.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.108
Finally, some real action!

11:58.152 --> 11:59.457
Don't get too excited.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.111
This is our third call
to the Bedfords this week.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.548
Yeah, it's probably the guy
with the new speakers again.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.997
Okay, wait in the car.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.389
You sure I can't go in?

12:18.433 --> 12:19.826
I promise I'll stay
out of the way.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.611
Stay here, and lock the
door if anybody comes.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.309
And, hey...

12:25.353 --> 12:27.355
don't fart in the car again.

12:31.098 --> 12:34.841
All units, we have
a suspect wanted for robbery

12:34.884 --> 12:37.452
just seen in the vicinity
of 2nd Avenue and Bedford.

12:37.495 --> 12:40.498
Suspect is wearing a white cap
and blue hoodie.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.763
No way.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.035
You two want to tell me

13:39.079 --> 13:40.384
what the hell happened?
Take it easy,

13:40.428 --> 13:41.690
Danny,
it was nobody's fault.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.909
What do you mean,
it's nobody's fault?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.084
My son's in the hospital
'cause of you two.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.607
I told him to
wait in the car.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.608
What the hell was he doing

13:46.651 --> 13:48.392
in a radio car
in the first place?

13:48.436 --> 13:49.524
He was on a ride-along.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.092
I know that.
How come nobody notified me?

13:52.135 --> 13:53.310
Wait, you didn't know?

13:53.354 --> 13:54.877
No, I didn't know!
The first I heard

13:54.921 --> 13:56.705
was when she told me
he was here.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.620
Wait, I thought you said
that Sean got his permission.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.143
He did.
Great.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.971
And you just believed him?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.494
I didn't think
he was lying to me, no.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.409
Well, then you're even
more naive than I thought.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.021
He's an 18-year-old male
with the last name Reagan.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.413
Which means he's an idiot.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.762
I'm sorry.
I should've checked with you.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.286
You're damn right
you should've checked with me!

14:12.329 --> 14:13.461
- Both of you!
Hey, guys,
the important thing

14:13.504 --> 14:14.592
is that Sean is okay.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.812
Oh, yeah, sure.
He's great.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.206
I mean, he's got a black eye
and a concussion,

14:19.249 --> 14:20.860
but other than that,
he's fine.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.600
No, all that I'm saying is
it could've been a lot worse.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.428
You're damn right
it could be a lot worse.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.561
We could be having
this conversation in a morgue,

14:26.604 --> 14:28.128
not the hospital.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.626
"Of two minds."

14:48.670 --> 14:52.500
Ten letters,
first three C-O-N.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.805
Conflicted.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.156
Exactly.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.115
Okay, I fell for it.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.248
Talk to me.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.424
I'm still talking to myself.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.254
Do you think I'm being selfish?

15:07.297 --> 15:10.126
For just considering the job?
No, not at all.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.347
No, um...
staying on this job so long.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.957
Well, you wouldn't still have it

15:15.001 --> 15:16.654
if you hadn't done right
by our city.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.266
Yeah, well...

15:20.528 --> 15:23.270
That's just a piece
of my problem here.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.232
Abetemarco's bumper sticker.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.147
"Erin Reagan for DA."

15:31.191 --> 15:33.149
Yeah.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.543
The fact is,
as long as I'm PC,

15:35.586 --> 15:38.111
it would be next to impossible
for her to win.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.461
That's not a fact,
that's pure conjecture.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.899
Well, it's just us;
let's call it a fact.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.075
Two members of the same family

15:46.119 --> 15:49.644
in two of the most powerful
positions in law enforcement

15:49.687 --> 15:50.950
in the same city?

15:50.993 --> 15:53.387
Who happen to be
the perfect people for the jobs.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.650
Yeah, says the guy
who started the dynasty.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.217
It's not a dynasty.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.784
It's a legacy of service.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.525
It's a family business.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.702
No one's gonna read
past "dynasty."

16:04.746 --> 16:06.487
That's how it will play.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.185
Have you talked to Erin?
Asked her what she thinks?

16:09.229 --> 16:12.536
No. I'm not going
to put this on her.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.669
Then own it.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.715
And what does that mean?

16:17.759 --> 16:19.717
That means
you're rounding third

16:19.761 --> 16:23.069
and now you'd like a little
something for yourself.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.420
Who wouldn't?

16:38.606 --> 16:40.042
Anything from CSU?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.827
No shell casings, or anything

16:42.871 --> 16:45.439
indicating there was a shooting
in Muhammed's SUV.

16:45.482 --> 16:46.875
It was practically spotless.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.485
Sounds like somebody
covering their tracks.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.487
Except his alibi checked out.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.054
Surveillance footage

16:52.098 --> 16:53.838
shows Muhammed was
in the restaurant

16:53.882 --> 16:55.014
at the time of the shooting.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.493
Wow.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.843
I would have bet anything
Muhammed was our guy.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.541
Why, what have you got?

17:00.584 --> 17:03.109
Dump came back
on Zahid's phone.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.633
Hundreds of text messages
and phone calls,

17:05.676 --> 17:09.071
late night, between Zahid
and Muhammed's wife.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.639
You think they were
having an affair?

17:11.682 --> 17:14.250
Well, Muhammed was sleeping
in the back of his restaurant,

17:14.294 --> 17:17.210
which means he wasn't at home
keeping his wife company.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.516
But why not just fire Zahid
on the spot?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.344
Why let the guy
keep working there?

17:21.388 --> 17:24.086
Maybe he knew his wife
was having an affair,

17:24.130 --> 17:25.479
but hadn't figured out
it was Zahid.

17:25.522 --> 17:26.828
Maybe.

17:26.871 --> 17:31.006
And he wouldn't be
the only injured party here.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.270
Oh, you thinking Zahid's wife?

17:35.750 --> 17:38.796
Well... You think
she's capable of murder?

17:38.840 --> 17:40.276
I don't know.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.626
She did show up to
the crime scene pretty quick.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.019
She was very distraught.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.542
Seemed legit to me.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.763
Well, doesn't mean
she didn't do it.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.941
- Just give me a minute.
- No.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.596
No, I...Can I please talk to
you for one minute?

17:56.771 --> 17:58.164
You got 30 seconds.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.514
Let's go.
Can you cover for me?

18:00.557 --> 18:02.081
Let's go.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.607
What is it?

18:06.650 --> 18:09.523
- I wanted to apologize.
- For what?

18:09.566 --> 18:11.046
Lying about
getting Danny's permission

18:11.090 --> 18:12.700
or disobeying Eddie
on patrol?

18:12.743 --> 18:14.180
Both, I guess.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.660
I told you to follow
her orders to the letter, Sean,

18:16.704 --> 18:17.922
no screwing around.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.490
So I was just supposed
to let that guy go?

18:20.534 --> 18:21.535
Yes.

18:21.578 --> 18:22.405
I'm not a coward.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.450
It doesn't make you a coward

18:23.493 --> 18:24.625
not wanting to get
yourself killed.

18:24.668 --> 18:25.756
And how many times
have you ended up

18:25.800 --> 18:27.628
in the hospital?
Or with a black eye?

18:27.671 --> 18:29.151
That's got nothing
to do with this.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.110
That has everything
to do with this.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.154
I just did

18:32.198 --> 18:33.721
what any of you guys
would've done.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.810
Is that what this whole
ride-along thing is about?

18:35.853 --> 18:37.420
- What do you mean?
- You trying to

18:37.464 --> 18:39.292
prove that you can be part
of the family business, too?

18:39.335 --> 18:42.512
- Of course not.
- Was there even
a sociology project?

18:43.600 --> 18:44.645
No.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.299
- Sean!
- I just wanted to see

18:46.342 --> 18:47.343
what it's like for you guys.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.562
What you do out there every day.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.998
So you lie to me, to your aunt,

18:50.041 --> 18:53.393
- and to your dad to do it?
- He never would've let me.

18:53.436 --> 18:54.829
You know what he's like.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.485
Yeah, I do, but--
Sean, but that's no excuse.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.269
He just doesn't listen.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.706
That's why I'm talking to you
instead of him.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.057
He listens.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.624
He's just...

19:07.668 --> 19:10.323
He can be
single-minded about it.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.153
Whatever.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.851
Did you at least arrest the guy?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.767
Yeah, your text helped.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.682
Yeah? Good.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.646
Detectives...

19:29.690 --> 19:32.258
We wondered if we could talk
to you for a minute.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.477
I suppose.

19:42.572 --> 19:45.053
Uh, this may be
a conversation

19:45.096 --> 19:47.360
that's better had
in private.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.449
Amir...

20:04.377 --> 20:05.552
How can I help you?

20:05.595 --> 20:06.683
How long were you
and your husband married?

20:06.727 --> 20:09.643
20 years.
We were married in India.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.862
Was it arranged?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.037
Arranged marriage is not

20:13.081 --> 20:14.648
a forced marriage.
His aunt set us up.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.476
So everything
was good here at home?

20:16.519 --> 20:18.652
No problems between
the two of you?

20:18.695 --> 20:20.523
Why are you asking all this?

20:21.655 --> 20:24.484
No. No, there was
no problems between us.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.789
You tracked

20:25.833 --> 20:27.138
your husband's cell phone
to the crime scene.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.531
Was that a usual thing for you,

20:28.575 --> 20:29.706
tracking him?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.317
No.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.274
Not exactly.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.276
Maybe it wasn't the first time

20:34.320 --> 20:36.104
Zahid went missing
late at night.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.760
I think you should leave.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.850
And we think you knew that
Zahid was having an affair

20:42.893 --> 20:44.504
- with Muhammed's wife.
- I said leave. Now.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.680
Where were you the night
your husband was killed?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.290
This is an insult to his memory.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.944
You knew Zahid's location,

20:49.987 --> 20:51.859
you had access to his job,

20:51.902 --> 20:53.382
you had motive.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.950
It would take
very little for you

20:55.993 --> 20:58.779
to pull Muhammad's keys
- off that hook.
- You're wrong.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.868
- Where were you?
- I was here.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.261
At home.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.958
Anyone that can verify that?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.708
I want a lawyer.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.276
Well, that's one truthful thing
that she said.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.385
Okay, what's going on here?

21:39.428 --> 21:43.127
People are hardly eating,
nobody's talking.

21:43.954 --> 21:48.307
Well, maybe some of us have
some things on our mind, Pop.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.265
I know you do.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.616
I'm talking
about your kiddos here.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.449
I'm fine.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.756
Good for you.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.847
Is there anything
you would like to share?

22:08.152 --> 22:11.286
Nope.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.550
Well, two precincts
reporting in.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.813
Would you pass
the cream, please?

22:18.075 --> 22:19.076
It's right there.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.251
She asked you
to pass the cream.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.427
Well, it's good to know
that she can ask

22:21.470 --> 22:23.516
for something
that <i>she</i> needs.
Dad.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.908
Would you just back off, Danny?

22:24.952 --> 22:25.909
Yeah. Please.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.694
You're in on this, too?

22:27.737 --> 22:29.086
This doesn't concern you, Erin.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.567
Well, clearly,
it concerns all of us now.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.960
- No one is the enemy here.
- Really?

22:33.003 --> 22:34.875
You put my son at risk,
I say different.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.137
That's not how
it went down.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.921
No, that's
not how it went down

22:37.965 --> 22:38.879
behind my back.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.097
It was not like that.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.272
Well, what was it like?

22:41.316 --> 22:43.274
Sean told me
that he had Danny's permission

22:43.318 --> 22:45.102
to go on a ride-along
with Eddie and Witten.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.583
And did he need it?
Your permission?

22:47.627 --> 22:48.715
He's my son.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.631
He's 18,
and that wasn't the question.

22:51.674 --> 22:52.936
It's a matter of respect, Dad.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.024
We respect you, Danny.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.113
Well, his eye says otherwise.

22:56.157 --> 22:56.897
How?

22:56.940 --> 22:57.941
Because I said so,

22:57.985 --> 23:00.248
- that's how.
- Hey, stop! Stop!

23:07.342 --> 23:09.692
It-it was my idea
to go on that ride-along.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.521
- Mine, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.834
And it was... it was my decision
to lie to you guys about that.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.402
I'm sorry.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.404
But it was my choice
to get out of that car

23:25.447 --> 23:27.493
and chase after that perp.

23:27.536 --> 23:30.626
Not Uncle Jamie and not Eddie.

23:33.455 --> 23:38.199
Oh, the apple didn't fall far
from the tree.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.855
I did what I thought
that you would do.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.291
And you thought wrong.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.814
And it's nice to see
you're on their side.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.337
No sides at this table.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.557
And if you're on my side,
you have no problem

23:48.601 --> 23:50.080
looking after your own.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.300
Is that what this is?
Yeah, that's what this is.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.171
Just like when you were
pissed off at me

23:54.215 --> 23:56.173
when I took your daughter
on a ride-along.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.175
Or did you forget
about that?

23:58.219 --> 23:59.655
And you-- if you can't run
with the big dogs,

23:59.699 --> 24:02.223
just stay on the porch
next time, okay?

24:15.758 --> 24:18.892
What? You didn't get
your fill of me in there?

24:18.935 --> 24:20.720
- Apparently not.
- Mm.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.504
Not really
in the mood to talk.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.507
Well, then, can you
just listen, please?

24:25.551 --> 24:28.292
Sure. What is it?

24:29.424 --> 24:30.904
Who loves you?

24:32.906 --> 24:34.864
I do.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.866
We all do.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.346
Love and respect you.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.522
I love and respect
all of you, too.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.872
What-what are you getting at?

24:44.744 --> 24:48.530
You have always had this
scorched-earth policy

24:48.574 --> 24:51.359
that has done well for you.

24:51.402 --> 24:54.405
Right? All through
sports, growing up.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.407
With the Marines, I'm sure.

24:56.451 --> 25:00.281
And now at work
as a detective.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.892
You decide what's wrong, and
you're gonna right that wrong,

25:02.936 --> 25:05.504
no matter how many toes
you have to stomp on.

25:09.812 --> 25:13.076
There are a lot of reasons
why I do things the way I do.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.557
All of them valid.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.560
Just leave 'em outside that door

25:18.604 --> 25:21.432
for all of our sakes,
including your own.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.354
Okay.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.364
<i>Why don't you tell us
a little more about</i>

25:40.408 --> 25:41.452
what happened that night, Maya?

25:41.496 --> 25:42.584
She was home making dinner.

25:42.628 --> 25:43.933
- Your name is Maya?
- No.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.456
But we've already
been over this.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.110
We've also
been over the fact

25:47.154 --> 25:49.591
that she has nobody
who can confirm her alibi.

25:49.635 --> 25:50.984
Her husband
could've been home

25:51.027 --> 25:52.420
if he wasn't murdered.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.074
She knows her husband
is dead, Detective.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.424
Yes, and we think she knows <i>how
her husband got dead,</i>

25:56.467 --> 25:58.121
- Counselor.
- Is there a point, Detectives?

25:58.165 --> 26:00.515
We're just establishing motive
and history.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.605
So, your husband
was having an affair,

26:03.649 --> 26:06.956
and you were embarrassed,
and you were angry.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.570
Coming to America is
a lot harder

26:11.613 --> 26:13.833
than it looks in the movies.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.749
He was so unhappy here.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.360
So he took his anger out on you?

26:19.403 --> 26:21.667
Everything was a problem.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.408
The clothes, the music.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.846
He was suffocating us.

26:28.369 --> 26:29.936
Me.

26:29.979 --> 26:34.767
He was suffocating me,
and I couldn't

26:34.810 --> 26:37.987
deal with it anymore.
I couldn't deal with him.

26:40.511 --> 26:42.905
- I want to confess.
- Slow down, Maya.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.474
There's no reason to go there
without striking a deal first.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.389
I don't want a deal.
I want to confess.

26:49.782 --> 26:52.698
- I did it. I killed my husband.
- Don't...

26:54.700 --> 26:56.353
Don't say anything else.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.051
She's already said enough.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.881
I need a minute alone
with my client?

27:01.924 --> 27:03.970
Sure.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.419
It's her birthday.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.119
Happy birthday!

27:23.163 --> 27:25.644
Sorry to barge in like this.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.646
Not at all.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.649
It is strange that security
didn't call you up.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.825
Well, I asked
them not to,

27:32.868 --> 27:36.698
and, uh, I told Annie
it was your birthday.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.613
It's not my birthday.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.355
Well, Annie doesn't know that,
does she?

27:41.398 --> 27:43.705
What is this?

27:43.749 --> 27:48.405
Well, I'm kind of
the Ghost of Elections Future,

27:48.449 --> 27:50.407
if you think about it.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.105
Should you decide to run.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.891
You'd be the Ghost?

27:55.935 --> 27:59.199
Yeah. Popping up
when you least expected it,

27:59.242 --> 28:02.593
with slanted questions
from reporters,

28:02.637 --> 28:05.422
or gauntlets thrown
by opponents in debates,

28:05.466 --> 28:09.905
or cartoons
on an editorial page.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.952
So...

28:12.995 --> 28:15.955
So, as PC,

28:15.998 --> 28:19.698
I would kind of be
the invisible running mate

28:19.741 --> 28:21.830
on your ticket.

28:21.874 --> 28:25.616
The Monopoly
in Law Enforcement Ticket.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.186
So you came up here
to convince me

28:30.230 --> 28:32.754
that running would be
a lost cause?

28:32.798 --> 28:35.626
No, I would never do that.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.068
I...

28:42.111 --> 28:44.635
I've been offered a job.

28:44.679 --> 28:48.161
Pretty good job, with the NFL.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.293
- The NFL?
- Yeah.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.165
You-you love the NFL.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.775
I do.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.777
Some of my fondest
childhood memories are

28:55.821 --> 28:57.474
of you and me watching the game

28:57.518 --> 29:00.129
and you not listening
to a word I said.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.438
You can't put this on me, Dad--

29:04.481 --> 29:07.484
making my choices
the fulcrum on which

29:07.528 --> 29:08.964
your decisions are made.

29:09.008 --> 29:12.228
Uh, I'm my own person,
not an extension of you.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.708
- I didn't say that.
- No.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.057
But you meant it.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.625
If I decide to run,

29:17.668 --> 29:19.409
it will be with
my eyes wide open,

29:19.453 --> 29:23.065
including about my family's
reputation in this city.

29:26.721 --> 29:29.463
So, here we are.

29:29.506 --> 29:30.856
Where?

29:30.899 --> 29:33.728
Are you going to run?

29:35.556 --> 29:39.560
When I know, you will know.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.041
Okay.

29:48.395 --> 29:51.398
Look, Dad...

29:51.441 --> 29:53.792
I wish I could help you.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.011
It's...

29:56.055 --> 29:58.797
it's got to be a hard choice.

30:00.015 --> 30:04.846
Do you take this cool, new,
fun job with the NFL, or...

30:04.890 --> 30:10.199
is the bluebird of happiness
still in your own backyard?

30:14.073 --> 30:16.684
Or in your case,

30:16.727 --> 30:19.687
the chronic felons of happiness.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.257
Yup.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.051
I am unsure why,

30:36.095 --> 30:38.924
but my client would like to put
her confession in writing.

30:38.967 --> 30:40.273
Well, that's great.

30:40.316 --> 30:42.884
Although, we can't offer
any deals here.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.103
She doesn't want one.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.975
Good. We do have
another question

30:47.019 --> 30:48.237
we'd like to ask...

30:48.281 --> 30:49.499
It'll be in
- her confession.
Well,

30:49.543 --> 30:52.024
actually, we'd like
to show you something.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.593
This look familiar to you?

30:56.637 --> 30:58.987
- Should it?
- Well,

30:59.031 --> 31:01.729
not this actual gun.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.078
This is a plastic replica.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.993
But ballistics reports

31:05.037 --> 31:08.040
show that this is
the exact type of gun

31:08.083 --> 31:10.216
that was used in Zahid's murder.

31:10.259 --> 31:14.698
Which you would have used if
you actually murdered Zahid.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.178
If?

31:16.222 --> 31:19.616
I remember now, yes,
this was the type of gun.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.009
- Good.

31:21.053 --> 31:23.359
So, you wouldn't mind
showing us then, would you?

31:23.403 --> 31:25.144
You know, how you shot Zahid.

31:29.496 --> 31:30.976
It's okay.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.934
It's just like a toy.
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.676
You can just aim it
at the wall over there.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.897
You don't have to do this.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.694
And that's how you held it?

31:53.737 --> 31:55.826
Yes.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.698
Just like that?

31:57.741 --> 31:59.743
Yes.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.270
And then you pulled the trigger?

32:05.575 --> 32:07.186
I did.

32:07.229 --> 32:10.058
You see, that's the problem
we're having.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.626
- What problem?
- Well,

32:12.669 --> 32:15.194
it looks kind of like
you are just imitating something

32:15.237 --> 32:16.543
you saw in an old western.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.197
We didn't sign up
for Guns 101, Detectives.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.894
- Well, maybe you should
have, Counselor,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.331
'cause if you did, you'd know
that if she actually pulled

32:22.375 --> 32:24.855
the trigger on a gun like that
while holding it that way,

32:24.899 --> 32:28.033
she'd have broken
- her thumb.
- Wait.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.209
I think I held it like this.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.993
Yeah, and you know
what I think?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.169
I think you've never held a gun
before in your life,

32:34.213 --> 32:37.607
including on the night
of your husband's murder.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.959
So you want to tell us
what's really going on?

32:41.002 --> 32:43.962
Or are you gonna stick
with that confession?

32:54.842 --> 32:57.323
Okay. Suit yourself.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.636
I mean, what if Maya is
covering for her son?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.811
I mean, look at him.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.117
He's practically
walking around

33:09.161 --> 33:10.858
with a sign on his back
that says "Kick me,"

33:10.901 --> 33:12.729
courtesy of his old man.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.122
So he hates his dad.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.081
Is that really enough reason
to kill him?

33:16.124 --> 33:17.996
A cheating dad,
maybe not.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.737
A hurt mom, maybe so.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.002
But we don't have squat
on him, though.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.004
We would have to throw out
the mom's confession

33:26.047 --> 33:27.309
just to keep the case open.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.919
Yeah, we're not
gonna throw it out.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.443
We're just gonna
let her go to jail?

33:31.661 --> 33:32.923
For now.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.621
Yeah.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.579
Entry is only permitted

33:36.623 --> 33:38.842
once you sign in.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.541
Please line up
to sign in.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.848
You must have
photo ID.

33:44.892 --> 33:47.373
What are you doing here?

33:47.416 --> 33:49.810
Why don't you take a walk
with us, okay?

33:51.377 --> 33:52.421
Gate.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.253
This way. Thank you.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.038
Right over here.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.911
You stand there.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.526
How long is she gonna be
in here?

34:10.570 --> 34:11.571
In this facility?

34:11.614 --> 34:13.312
A couple months.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.314
Till they move her
to state prison.

34:15.357 --> 34:18.099
Then she'll probably spend
the rest of her life there.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.536
- For self-defense?
- Wasn't self-defense.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.061
She shot your dad
when he was making a delivery.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.019
He was suffocating us.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.980
You don't know how hard it was
for us living with him.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.809
Harder than a life alone

34:32.853 --> 34:34.028
behind bars?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.421
I'll-I'll visit.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.813
Less and less.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.641
You don't know anything
about me.

34:38.685 --> 34:42.515
We know that you're a lot more
like your dad than you think.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.995
I'm nothing like him.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.607
I'd never hurt her.

34:48.390 --> 34:51.915
Not for nothing, but it looks
like she's hurting right now.

34:51.959 --> 34:56.137
He lied, then he cheated.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.487
And he had the nerve to hit her

34:58.531 --> 35:00.489
when she confronted him
about it.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.751
She didn't deserve that.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.057
No!

35:05.494 --> 35:07.105
She didn't.

35:08.454 --> 35:11.283
Do you think she deserves this?

35:19.204 --> 35:21.380
I just wanted to protect her.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.557
Well,
why don't you protect her now?

35:36.395 --> 35:38.484
Okay.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.574
Okay, what?

35:47.536 --> 35:49.712
I did it.

35:49.756 --> 35:52.280
I killed my dad.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.154
We know.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.283
So?

36:39.762 --> 36:42.330
It's not so much the perks,

36:42.374 --> 36:45.290
although I've never
been to a Super Bowl,

36:45.333 --> 36:46.987
and that'd be kind of neat.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.380
Correction.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.120
You've never been
to the Super Bowl

36:50.164 --> 36:51.948
sitting in the commissioner's box.

36:51.992 --> 36:53.559
That would be unforgettable.

36:53.602 --> 36:56.649
And I could bring my
people along with me?

36:56.692 --> 36:58.607
Oh, it's an easy point
to negotiate.

36:58.651 --> 37:01.262
They'll want you comfortable
and confident.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.962
That'd be nice.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.704
You know what else
would be nice?

37:08.748 --> 37:10.663
A seven-figure salary.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.274
Never having to worry
about money again?

37:14.362 --> 37:15.798
Tell me about it.

37:16.973 --> 37:18.758
Don't underestimate that.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.808
I don't.

37:30.073 --> 37:33.163
The writers, uh, Joseph Heller
and Kurt Vonnegut--

37:33.207 --> 37:34.991
they're at this...

37:35.035 --> 37:38.821
at this billionaire's party
on Shelter Island,

37:38.865 --> 37:42.695
and Vonnegut says,
"You know, Joe,

37:42.738 --> 37:45.437
"this guy makes more money
in a day than you did

37:45.480 --> 37:49.136
on all the sales of <i>Catch-22."</i>

37:49.179 --> 37:51.704
And Heller says,

37:51.747 --> 37:56.317
"Yeah, but I got something
he will never have--

37:56.361 --> 37:58.711
enough."

38:02.192 --> 38:05.587
Yeah. Well, that's a nice story
to tell yourself

38:05.631 --> 38:08.416
when you realize
you're never gonna make bank.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.638
Are you getting all wobbly
on me here, Frank?

38:12.681 --> 38:14.814
What's your skin in this, Lenny?

38:14.857 --> 38:16.163
What do you mean?

38:16.206 --> 38:17.512
You getting some kind

38:17.556 --> 38:20.994
of headhunter fee or something
if I do sign on?

38:21.037 --> 38:23.039
Okay.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.128
That hurts.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.485
I'm sorry, Lenny. I really am.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.748
I'm sorry.

38:37.184 --> 38:41.014
It's just, this thing-- it's...
it's got me flailing,

38:41.057 --> 38:44.365
stomping on the toes
of people I love.

38:45.148 --> 38:48.587
Frank, the people who love you
just want you to be happy, okay?

38:48.630 --> 38:50.415
I-I know that.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.677
Then just accept that.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.114
Well, hey, I'm trying.

38:54.157 --> 38:55.333
Well, try harder.

38:57.247 --> 39:01.469
I thought the selfish thing
would be to take the job,

39:01.513 --> 39:05.081
the money, the perks, but...

39:05.125 --> 39:09.129
I realize the selfish thing,
for me,

39:09.172 --> 39:13.002
would be to stay here,
where I feel valuable.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.048
And you know
what everybody's saying?

39:15.091 --> 39:17.572
They're saying,
"Be a little selfish."

39:17.616 --> 39:19.400
You've earned it.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.402
Yeah.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.014
So, I'm taking 'em up on it.

39:26.538 --> 39:29.410
Just not the way
they would have thought.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.330
Huh.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.898
I just lost a bet with myself.

39:38.941 --> 39:41.204
On why you'd pass, if you did.

39:43.119 --> 39:45.426
What'd you bet on?

39:46.384 --> 39:50.431
The picture of you
with 33 bosses,

39:50.475 --> 39:54.174
and one of 'em called
"The Commissioner."

39:57.003 --> 39:59.397
That would be the smart money.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.099
Hey, partners for life.

40:08.797 --> 40:11.017
Thank you, Lenny.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.063
Any time.

40:21.244 --> 40:22.681
You got a second?

40:22.724 --> 40:24.683
Not really.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.162
It's about Sean.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.990
What, is he in the
hospital again?

40:28.034 --> 40:29.992
No, Danny,
but I think I can help.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.341
I don't need your help.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.300
Would you listen to me?

40:33.343 --> 40:35.998
I know how he feels in ways
that maybe you couldn't

40:36.042 --> 40:37.783
because I grew up
under you, too.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.438
What the hell does that even
mean-- you grew up under me?

40:40.481 --> 40:41.743
Looking up to you.

40:41.787 --> 40:44.180
You were cool
in sixth grade.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.834
Who the hell's cool
in sixth grade, Danny?

40:45.878 --> 40:47.836
Maybe you were
just so uncool

40:47.880 --> 40:50.143
that I seemed like
a god by comparison.

40:50.186 --> 40:53.320
People saw you as Danny Reagan,
the high school athlete,

40:53.363 --> 40:55.322
and then Marine,
and then you came back,

40:55.365 --> 40:56.845
and you were
the decorated rookie.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.500
And then star detective
and solid family man.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.720
And when Joe died...

41:04.200 --> 41:07.508
And I came back
to try and...

41:07.552 --> 41:08.857
fill that hole,

41:08.901 --> 41:10.990
the hardest part
was going back

41:11.033 --> 41:12.861
and playing on the fields
that you used to play on,

41:12.905 --> 41:16.517
and comparing myself to you,
and always coming up short.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.566
What do you want me
to do with this, kid?

41:22.915 --> 41:25.483
I don't know.
You just-just own it. Just...

41:25.526 --> 41:27.485
There are guys
in your life who feel like

41:27.528 --> 41:30.749
they come up short with you,
so bend towards them a little.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.447
How?

41:33.491 --> 41:36.189
I don't...
You'll figure it out.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.756
See ya.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.770
What?

41:51.813 --> 41:53.772
- It's your father.
Open the door, quick!

41:53.815 --> 41:56.078
Come on! It's urgent.

41:56.818 --> 41:59.691
I just got a call to a hostage
situation over on the Bowery.

41:59.734 --> 42:01.388
You want to ride along?

42:01.431 --> 42:02.389
Really?

42:02.432 --> 42:04.434
No.

42:05.044 --> 42:07.742
- You got me.
- Well, I got
something else, too.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.396
Reservations at Gallaghers,

42:09.439 --> 42:13.313
me and you, couple steaks
and a couple beers?

42:13.356 --> 42:15.097
I'm 18. They won't serve me.

42:18.492 --> 42:20.233
You're a freshman in college.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.931
You're trying to tell me
you don't have a fake ID?

42:25.151 --> 42:26.935
For emergencies.

42:26.979 --> 42:29.155
Right. For emergencies.

42:29.198 --> 42:30.286
Yep.

42:30.330 --> 42:32.419
Good thinking.

42:32.462 --> 42:34.639
Why don't you put on
a proper shirt, okay?

42:34.682 --> 42:35.553
Yes, sir.
