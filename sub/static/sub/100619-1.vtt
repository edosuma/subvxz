59:35.833 --> 59:40.750
...ten year alignment event, coinciding
with Subject's past trauma.

59:41.625 --> 59:45.625
...orders of magnitude
telekinetic amplification.

59:48.041 --> 59:51.791
Okay, final target is well within
Subject's sphere of influence.

59:55.625 --> 59:57.833
The projected apparition is closing in.

1:01:34.250 --> 1:01:36.000
What happened?

1:01:36.041 --> 1:01:37.750
Final target is down.

1:01:44.625 --> 1:01:45.625
May I?

1:01:51.458 --> 1:01:55.208
Second test successful - after
Subject's post-institute deployment.

1:01:56.041 --> 1:02:02.875
One hundred percent loss of life within
Subject's S.O.I. after 48 hours.

1:02:03.458 --> 1:02:05.875
A true agent of chaos.

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:11.833
We've demonstrated, again, Subject
can be led to a target zone...

1:02:12.833 --> 1:02:17.916
...and cause destruction via
augmented telekinetic projection...

1:02:21.250 --> 1:02:24.000
...without Subject's
knowledge or compliance.

1:02:27.250 --> 1:02:28.250
Keep it on.

1:07:05.208 --> 1:07:06.916

1:07:12.041 --> 1:07:14.875
So, Comrade, tell me.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:18.291
What does the <i>monster </i>look like?

1:07:21.041 --> 1:07:23.291
There is no way to know
from this vantage.

1:07:24.458 --> 1:07:30.083
How <i>it </i>looks is the result of
her stimulus and input.

1:07:32.041 --> 1:07:37.000
The P.A. may change after a single new
piece of information is given to Subject.

1:07:37.041 --> 1:07:42.583
He may appear different to
Subject than the targets.

1:07:42.625 --> 1:07:44.083
No way to know.

1:07:47.250 --> 1:07:50.458
May I remind you of the Subject's value?

1:07:51.625 --> 1:07:54.583
Don't worry. The P.A. can't hurt her.
She made him.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:57.041
A construct of her mind.

1:08:00.458 --> 1:08:01.541
It would be like...

1:08:03.458 --> 1:08:04.833
...killing yourself in a dream.
