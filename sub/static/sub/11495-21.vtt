WEBVTT

00:04.923 --> 00:06.890
Oh. Hey.
Hey.

00:06.892 --> 00:08.559
I thought you and Alan
were going out to dinner.

00:08.561 --> 00:10.360
We were supposed to,
but then he discovered

00:10.362 --> 00:12.429
his coupon was only good
for to-go orders.

00:12.431 --> 00:14.798
That guy's a piece of work.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.766
He is.

00:15.768 --> 00:16.967
Which is ironic,

00:16.969 --> 00:19.353
'cause he never seems
to go to work.

00:19.355 --> 00:21.572
That's true.

00:21.574 --> 00:22.439
That being said,

00:22.441 --> 00:23.974
I do envy what
you guys have.

00:23.976 --> 00:26.276
You guys are like termites.

00:26.278 --> 00:28.412
Termites?

00:28.414 --> 00:30.313
Yeah, they mate for life,
and once they live

00:30.315 --> 00:31.915
in your house,
you can never get rid of 'em.

00:33.118 --> 00:36.036
Just like Alan.

00:36.038 --> 00:37.371
You all right?

00:37.373 --> 00:39.673
Yeah, I...

00:39.675 --> 00:41.341
I have to do something
with him tonight

00:41.343 --> 00:42.793
that's going to be
really painful.

00:42.795 --> 00:45.429
Okay, that's between
two consenting adults.

00:45.431 --> 00:47.464
No...

00:49.001 --> 00:50.551
I'm breaking up
with him.

00:50.553 --> 00:52.335
What?

00:53.438 --> 00:55.889
No, but you guys are great
together.

00:55.891 --> 00:58.642
You're so beautiful

00:58.644 --> 01:00.944
and smart and fun and...

01:00.946 --> 01:03.230
Alan's so...

01:03.232 --> 01:04.513
lucky.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.818
I don't want
to hurt him.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.037
Then do something else.

01:10.039 --> 01:12.188
Disneyland, dancing, bowling,

01:12.190 --> 01:14.074
pretty much anything
but break up with him.

01:14.076 --> 01:15.492
I have to.

01:15.494 --> 01:17.411
But you and I are his world.

01:17.413 --> 01:19.379
And if you leave,
I'll be his world.

01:19.381 --> 01:20.714
I'm sorry.

01:20.716 --> 01:22.215
No, I don't think
you heard me.

01:22.217 --> 01:24.384
I'll. Be. His. World.

01:24.386 --> 01:27.254
I feel so bad.

01:28.307 --> 01:30.040
All right.

01:30.042 --> 01:31.208
Come here.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.313
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

01:36.315 --> 01:38.982
And I pushed a baby
out of my vagina.

01:40.152 --> 01:42.019
I'm back!

01:43.072 --> 01:45.055
Don't say anything.

01:45.057 --> 01:47.441
Oh. Hey, Walden.
Want to join us?

01:47.443 --> 01:50.360
Uh... no, thanks.

01:50.362 --> 01:53.030
Hey, what do you say
we all go bowling?

01:53.032 --> 01:54.731
Huh?

01:54.733 --> 01:56.166
Doesn't that sound fun?

01:56.168 --> 01:57.701
Just bowling?

01:57.703 --> 02:00.570
No, I... I think we're
just gonna stay in tonight.

02:00.572 --> 02:02.572
Uh... oh, but I have
a confession to make.

02:02.574 --> 02:05.075
I, uh, opened my fortune
cookie in the car...

02:05.077 --> 02:06.426
and listen to this:

02:06.428 --> 02:09.545
uh... "your life is about to
take a turn for the better."

02:13.885 --> 02:17.354
I think you may have gotten
Lyndsey's cookie.

02:51.646 --> 02:52.779
Would you like another
glass of wi...?

02:52.781 --> 02:53.947
Yes.

03:01.823 --> 03:03.323
Oh, you know,
I was thinking, uh...

03:03.325 --> 03:05.726
after dinner we could
light a fire.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.828
Don't worry, I've got all
the wood we'll need.

03:15.169 --> 03:17.337
Cute.

03:17.339 --> 03:20.073
Just, uh... you seem
awfully quiet tonight.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.108
Is everything okay?

03:21.110 --> 03:23.477
I-I've just got
a lot on my mind.

03:23.479 --> 03:25.479
Hmm, what is it,
sweetie?

03:25.481 --> 03:27.481
Oh, boy.

03:27.483 --> 03:28.715
I don't know
how to say this.

03:28.717 --> 03:31.551
Well, a problem shared is
a problem halved.

03:31.553 --> 03:33.687
It's kind of like
that fried rice,

03:33.689 --> 03:35.389
although I noticed
you didn't touch your half,

03:35.391 --> 03:37.457
despite the fact
that you had to order it,

03:37.459 --> 03:38.926
even though
the white rice is free

03:38.928 --> 03:42.029
and the coupon specifically
said "no substitutions."

03:42.031 --> 03:44.331
I think we should break up.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.067
Excuse me.

03:51.739 --> 03:53.307
Are you okay?

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.625 --> 04:12.826
You owe me $22.50 for dinner.

04:15.279 --> 04:16.613
Hey, Berta.

04:16.615 --> 04:18.832
Just finishing up.
Then I'll get out of your way.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.550
No, I think
you should stay here.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.002
All right.

04:22.004 --> 04:24.137
Let me take
a quick shower first.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.006
No.

04:26.008 --> 04:28.308
Lyndsey's downstairs breaking up
with Alan.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.426
Really?

04:29.428 --> 04:30.477
Yeah.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.764
Well... we knew this was coming.

04:33.766 --> 04:35.515
First time I saw them together,

04:35.517 --> 04:36.850
I asked her to blink twice

04:36.852 --> 04:38.802
if she was being held hostage.

04:38.804 --> 04:41.238
He's gonna be devastated.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.824
I mean, he's madly
in love with her,

04:43.826 --> 04:44.825
they've been dating for years,

04:44.827 --> 04:46.193
they were planning
on getting married.

04:46.195 --> 04:48.945
Oh, my God,
he's never gonna leave my house.

04:48.947 --> 04:52.833
It's sweet that you actually
thought he was going to.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.685
Why do people have to break up?

04:54.687 --> 04:56.420
Well, in my experience,

04:56.422 --> 04:58.121
either the magic wears off,

04:58.123 --> 04:59.623
or the mushrooms.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.593
I feel really bad for him.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.212
I mean,
I always feel bad for him.

05:05.214 --> 05:07.381
But I feel <i>really</i> bad for him.

05:07.383 --> 05:08.799
Yeah, yeah. It's tough.

05:08.801 --> 05:11.501
We gonna do this thing
or what?

05:16.057 --> 05:18.058
I don't understand.
Where is this coming from?

05:18.060 --> 05:19.943
There's no spark anymore.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.778
All we do is sit around,
watch TV and eat takeout

05:21.780 --> 05:23.730
from whatever restaurant
you have a coupon for.

05:23.732 --> 05:25.198
Did you want to go
to the food court?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.233
'Cause we can do that.

05:26.235 --> 05:28.652
Alan, it's not that.

05:28.654 --> 05:29.870
Then, what is it?

05:29.872 --> 05:31.405
I mean, I-I...
I thought you were happy.

05:31.407 --> 05:32.622
I-I thought
everything was great.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.191
It was, but, but things
change, people change.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.044
That's not true.
I don't change. I never change.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.629
Maybe that's part
of the problem.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.197
I can change.

05:41.199 --> 05:42.833
I-I know this is upsetting,

05:42.835 --> 05:45.535
but, but better to do this
now before it gets worse.

05:45.537 --> 05:46.887
How can it be worse?

05:46.889 --> 05:48.388
You gonna tell me you've been
faking it all these years?

05:48.390 --> 05:49.506
Don't answer that.

05:51.259 --> 05:52.309
Alan, I have to go.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.260
Fine, go.

05:53.262 --> 05:55.562
Don't go.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.681
I-I'm really sorry.

05:57.683 --> 06:00.434
The thing is, I-I
still love you, Alan.

06:01.853 --> 06:04.220
I'm just not in love
with you anymore.

06:08.609 --> 06:10.694
It's not a deal-breaker.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.732
You okay?

06:15.734 --> 06:17.734
I guess.

06:17.736 --> 06:20.003
I suppose it's better that
she broke up with me now

06:20.005 --> 06:22.038
than after we got married.

06:22.040 --> 06:25.292
Then she would've gotten
half of all my stuff.

06:30.531 --> 06:32.632
Sure.

06:34.635 --> 06:37.253
You know I'm
here for you.

06:37.255 --> 06:40.223
I know that and,
and I appreciate it.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.359
But... I'm good.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.560
Good.

06:45.513 --> 06:47.164
Walden?

06:47.166 --> 06:48.365
Yeah?

06:49.150 --> 06:51.100
I'm not good.

06:51.102 --> 06:53.403
I love her.

06:54.773 --> 06:55.906
I know you do.

06:55.908 --> 06:58.241
I'll never find another one
like her.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.377
I know you won't.

07:02.914 --> 07:05.665
I-I'm just saying, I-I
know how great she is.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.050
You're gonna be fine.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.619
Just... you have to focus on
the good things in your life.

07:09.621 --> 07:12.889
Lyndsey was the only
good thing in my life.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.975
Oh, God...
It's okay.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.960
Let it all out.

07:22.967 --> 07:26.069
That's a lot out.
Let's-let's put some back in.

07:29.775 --> 07:32.809
Now you're all I have!

07:45.706 --> 07:47.958
I know.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.430
Good morning.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.298
Beautiful day.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.350
To... stick your head
in an oven?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.438
Okay, I realize I was a
little upset last night.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.772
A little?

08:02.774 --> 08:05.174
You Googled "how to kill
yourself without it hurting."

08:05.176 --> 08:07.043
Drama queen.

08:07.045 --> 08:09.079
But I woke up
this morning

08:09.081 --> 08:11.147
and I realized, "What
am I so upset about?"

08:11.149 --> 08:13.016
Lyndsey and I are
not breaking up.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.253
Okay.

08:16.255 --> 08:19.956
So, when she said that she
didn't want to see you anymore

08:19.958 --> 08:22.309
and she didn't think you made
a good couple

08:22.311 --> 08:23.843
and she wasn't in love with you,
that...

08:23.845 --> 08:24.995
What do you call that?

08:24.997 --> 08:27.697
Foreplay.

08:27.699 --> 08:30.366
Okay. Looks like someone's
starting the day

08:30.368 --> 08:32.719
with a hot, steaming cup
of denial.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.304
No, no, no. This is a little
dance we do all the time.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.140
She decides that
I did something wrong

08:37.142 --> 08:38.408
and gives me the business,

08:38.409 --> 08:39.576
and then I apologize,

08:39.578 --> 08:41.278
and I give her the business.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.732
Okay, see, that right there?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.684
That's why she broke up
with you.

08:47.686 --> 08:49.819
I'm telling you,
we are not broken up.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.188
Okay, I see what
you're doing here,

08:52.190 --> 08:54.791
but pretending like what
happened didn't happen

08:54.793 --> 08:56.026
won't make it not happen,

08:56.028 --> 08:59.362
no matter what you would like
to have had happened.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.197
Yeah, that's right.

09:01.199 --> 09:03.950
Well, thank you,
I appreciate it.

09:03.952 --> 09:06.419
But if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get my girl back.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.938
Okay.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.173
Just in case,
I'll preheat the oven.

09:17.748 --> 09:19.816
Alan?

09:19.818 --> 09:21.217
What are you doing here?

09:21.219 --> 09:23.303
What am I doing here?

09:23.305 --> 09:24.721
That's what I love about you.

09:24.723 --> 09:26.056
Okay, let's do this.

09:26.058 --> 09:28.475
I'm sorry.

09:30.394 --> 09:32.595
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.364
Our relationship just
isn't going anywhere.

09:34.366 --> 09:37.200
All right, all right. Message
received, loud and clear.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.652
Now let's get down to bidness.

09:40.354 --> 09:42.706
Alan, it's over.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.107
But... but why?

09:44.109 --> 09:46.293
I-It just is.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.211
Is it because we don't
like the same things?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.413
'Cause I can learn
to love sports.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.948
It has nothing
to do with that...

09:51.950 --> 09:53.249
Is it, is it
because I'm-I'm frugal?

09:53.251 --> 09:54.501
'Cause okay, watch this.

09:54.503 --> 09:58.138
I am going to rip a twent--
a five-dollar bill in half.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.339
Okay?

10:00.591 --> 10:03.093
Tell me that's not sexy.

10:03.095 --> 10:05.628
Okay, look...

10:05.630 --> 10:07.314
I didn't want
to have to say this,

10:07.316 --> 10:10.934
but the fact of the matter is...

10:10.936 --> 10:11.935
I've met someone else.

10:11.937 --> 10:13.687
Oh. Wow.

10:13.689 --> 10:14.971
Wow. Uh...

10:14.973 --> 10:17.157
World spinning,
uh, gut tightening,

10:17.159 --> 10:18.992
vomit rising... um...

10:18.994 --> 10:20.710
I'm really sorry.

10:20.712 --> 10:22.329
Well, well, who is he?
What's the difference?

10:22.331 --> 10:24.831
Well, I-I need to know
who my competition is.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.333
I-I need to know how I can win.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.668
You can't win.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.753
Good-bye, Alan.

10:31.857 --> 10:33.923
Well, I have got
news for you.

10:33.925 --> 10:37.010
The word "win" is not
in my vocabular...

10:37.012 --> 10:38.094
"Can't."

10:38.096 --> 10:40.930
The word "can't" is not
in my vocabulary.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.632
Damn it.

10:43.702 --> 10:45.835
Son of a bitch!

10:52.643 --> 10:54.677
Of course.

10:54.679 --> 10:56.880
Dog crap.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.546
Hey, there's soup on the stove
if you want some.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.650
I wonder if Lyndsey's
new boyfriend likes soup.

11:16.652 --> 11:19.069
He probably loves soup.

11:19.071 --> 11:21.421
And wears cable knit sweaters.

11:21.423 --> 11:23.440
"Look at me,
I'm eating soup

11:23.442 --> 11:26.026
"and wearing a sweater
while I bang the memory

11:26.028 --> 11:27.911
of Alan Harper
out of this woman's mind."

11:34.168 --> 11:35.835
Alan, let it go.

11:35.837 --> 11:36.870
You brought it up.

11:36.872 --> 11:38.622
I brought up soup.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.758
I can't stop thinking about him.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.644
And her...
and what they're doing.

11:44.646 --> 11:47.264
And what position
they're doing it in.

11:47.266 --> 11:48.915
And where they're doing it.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.635
In the bed, in the shower,
at the Costco

11:51.637 --> 11:54.754
between the meat and the tires.
That was our place!

11:54.756 --> 11:57.707
That shouldn't be
anyone's place.

11:59.110 --> 12:00.977
And you're obsessing.
No, I'm not.

12:00.979 --> 12:03.096
Right, we all picture
our exes screwing

12:03.098 --> 12:05.148
between a rump roast
and a snow tire.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.651
You know what,
I-I'm gonna go for a drive.

12:07.653 --> 12:08.768
Where?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.570
Just out, you know, joyride.

12:10.572 --> 12:13.540
I've seen your car,
there's no joy in that ride.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.993
Now where are you going?
I'm just gonna drive

12:16.995 --> 12:19.246
up the coast a little bit.
Take in the sea air.

12:19.248 --> 12:21.464
How? Your windows
don't roll down.

12:21.466 --> 12:23.833
Just the ones in the front. The
ones in the back don't roll up.

12:23.835 --> 12:25.552
Good-bye.

12:26.387 --> 12:28.672
I should buy him a new car.

12:28.674 --> 12:31.057
So he can live in it.

12:32.810 --> 12:34.511
♪ Men

12:34.513 --> 12:36.012
All right.

12:36.014 --> 12:37.847
Where are they?

12:37.849 --> 12:42.152
They're probably
watching sports right now.

12:42.154 --> 12:44.971
"Hello, Lyndsey,
you don't mind if I watch

12:44.973 --> 12:48.474
"this baseball game
in the nude, do you?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.528
"Sure, you can kiss me
between the strikes

12:51.530 --> 12:54.364
and I'll kiss you
between the balls."

12:57.451 --> 13:00.120
Oh.

13:00.122 --> 13:01.755
Hey, Walden.

13:01.757 --> 13:03.673
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
you know, taking a drive

13:03.675 --> 13:06.543
down the Malibu coast,
trying to clear my head.

13:06.545 --> 13:08.845
Yeah, now I'm, uh,
I'm walking on the beach.

13:08.847 --> 13:10.797
Sand feels nice on my toesies.

13:16.053 --> 13:17.337
Walking on the beach, huh?

13:17.339 --> 13:18.521
Are you stalking me?

13:18.523 --> 13:19.773
Are you stalking Lyndsey?

13:19.775 --> 13:21.658
I asked you first.

13:21.660 --> 13:22.742
Look, this
is pathetic.

13:22.744 --> 13:23.860
Sitting outside
a woman's house,

13:23.862 --> 13:25.945
trying to catch of glimpse
of her through the window.

13:25.947 --> 13:27.447
What kind
of person does that?

13:30.701 --> 13:33.036
Hey, guys, what are we doing?

13:33.038 --> 13:35.322
Playing a little peek-a-boo
with Lyndsey?

13:35.324 --> 13:36.539
No.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.491
Yes.

13:38.493 --> 13:39.793
Lyndsey broke
up with Alan

13:39.795 --> 13:41.294
and he's having a hard
time understanding.

13:41.296 --> 13:42.996
Oh, well, one look
at the new guy

13:42.998 --> 13:43.997
and you'd understand it.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.416
What, you've seen him?
Oh, yeah.

13:46.418 --> 13:47.334
Nick's gorgeous.

13:47.336 --> 13:48.468
Kind of looks like Walden.

13:48.470 --> 13:49.919
Aw, thank you.

13:49.921 --> 13:52.672
Y-You know his name,
so you-you've met him?

13:52.674 --> 13:54.474
Well, no,
but I've heard her yell it.

13:54.476 --> 13:57.143
It's either Nick
or Oh, God, Right There.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.046
Oh, that's it.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.215
I got to see this Nick guy
for myself.

14:03.267 --> 14:05.551
No, Alan, don't.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.270
You're better than this.

14:07.272 --> 14:09.406
We both know
that's not true!

14:10.391 --> 14:13.443
Yeah, I feel for him.
It's got to be tough.

14:13.445 --> 14:15.561
Yeah, no doubt.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.031
You really are
a very handsome man.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.566
Again... thank you.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.587
It's not hard to imagine you
naked and cast in marble.

14:26.524 --> 14:28.908
Getting weird, Herb.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.877
Right.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.767
All right.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.102
Where are you, you homewrecker?

14:39.104 --> 14:41.388
Oh...

14:51.365 --> 14:53.316
That's better.

14:56.905 --> 14:59.122
Ugh.

15:00.624 --> 15:03.159
Can this get any worse?

15:03.161 --> 15:07.113
Oh, God, Nick, right there!

15:07.115 --> 15:09.782
Aw.

15:15.090 --> 15:16.139
Lyndsey,

15:16.141 --> 15:17.390
hey.

15:17.392 --> 15:18.441
Hey,

15:18.443 --> 15:19.676
I need your help.

15:19.678 --> 15:22.429
You need my help getting
back together with Alan?

15:22.431 --> 15:25.598
No. I need you to tell him
to stop calling, e-mailing,

15:25.600 --> 15:26.599
and texting me.

15:26.601 --> 15:27.967
Words and pictures.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.602
Especially the pictures.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.906
He's just upset.
He means well.

15:32.908 --> 15:34.607
Really?
Does this picture look

15:34.609 --> 15:35.809
like he means well?

15:35.811 --> 15:38.411
Oh, dear God.

15:38.413 --> 15:42.015
Is he lying on my kitchen table?

15:42.017 --> 15:43.983
So, will you talk to him?

15:43.985 --> 15:48.004
Sure, right after I burn
my kitchen table.

15:48.006 --> 15:52.658
Thank you. By the way, you might
want to burn your bathtub, too.

15:53.678 --> 15:55.678
Oh, he's coming now.
Got to go.

15:58.966 --> 16:02.302
Hey. There he is.

16:02.304 --> 16:04.971
Looking good.

16:04.973 --> 16:07.023
Ha-ha.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.727
Where you going?

16:10.729 --> 16:13.012
Lyndsey un-friended me
on Facebook.

16:13.014 --> 16:16.316
So I'm going to go
re-friend her with my face.

16:16.318 --> 16:17.917
No, you're not.

16:17.919 --> 16:19.519
You can't stop me.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.564
Damn you.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.056
Hey, Zip.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.841
Oh, what do you want?

16:41.843 --> 16:45.845
A motorcycle and another night
with Neil Diamond.

16:45.847 --> 16:48.314
But for now we need to talk.

16:48.316 --> 16:50.266
I just want to be left alone.

16:50.268 --> 16:53.069
Like I'm gonna be
for the rest of my life.

16:53.071 --> 16:55.388
Look, Lyndsey's crazy
for breaking up with you.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.940
You are a great guy.

16:56.942 --> 16:58.157
You're just saying that.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.609
I know I'm rough on you,

16:59.611 --> 17:00.777
but that's just for fun.

17:00.779 --> 17:03.079
I really mean this.

17:03.081 --> 17:05.281
Oh, thank you.

17:05.282 --> 17:07.666
All right,
good talk.

17:07.669 --> 17:09.068
How?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.587
What?

17:10.589 --> 17:12.905
How am I a great guy?

17:16.176 --> 17:19.244
Well, you're
punctual.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.747
I-I do make it
a priority to be on time.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.266
Yep.

17:23.268 --> 17:25.050
What else?

17:28.022 --> 17:29.439
Okay.

17:29.441 --> 17:32.809
You have pretty good toilet aim.

17:32.811 --> 17:35.728
And that's important
to a housekeeper.

17:35.730 --> 17:38.531
My secret is, I sit down.

17:39.383 --> 17:41.367
And that should've
stayed a secret.

17:41.369 --> 17:42.785
Take care.

17:42.787 --> 17:44.203
Berta?

17:44.205 --> 17:47.323
What?

17:47.325 --> 17:49.726
I-I-If I'm such
a great guy,

17:49.728 --> 17:52.245
then why did
Lyndsey leave me?

17:52.247 --> 17:54.447
Oh, there's no telling
with chicks.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.917
But don't worry...
you'll find somebody else.

17:57.919 --> 17:59.252
As good as Lyndsey?

18:00.422 --> 18:04.591
Look at you,
already making jokes.

18:08.012 --> 18:09.462
How'd it go?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.464
He's gonna die alone.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.466
And he pees sitting down.

18:17.938 --> 18:20.973
I really don't want
to be here, Walden.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.191
What are you
talking about?

18:22.193 --> 18:23.359
You're doing great.

18:23.361 --> 18:25.745
You shaved,
you showered.

18:25.747 --> 18:27.614
You realized wearing
Lyndsey's underwear

18:27.616 --> 18:30.450
wasn't a
long-term solution.

18:30.452 --> 18:32.318
I may have it together
on the outside,

18:32.320 --> 18:33.986
but on the inside
I'm still a wreck.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.706
I just want to go home and
eat ice cream on the toilet

18:36.708 --> 18:37.823
until I fall asleep.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.326
Would you listen
to yourself?

18:40.328 --> 18:42.595
Trust me, tonight
is going to be fun.

18:42.597 --> 18:45.164
Okay. But if it's not,
you're gonna have to watch

18:45.166 --> 18:46.499
<i>The Notebook</i> with me.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.834
Really? Again?

18:49.687 --> 18:51.387
Walden.

18:51.389 --> 18:53.773
Oh, hey, Allie, hi.

18:53.775 --> 18:56.275
This is, uh, my friend Alan
I was telling you about.

18:56.277 --> 18:57.276
Hi, Alan.

18:57.278 --> 18:58.277
Hello.

18:58.279 --> 18:59.979
You two have
a lot in common.

18:59.981 --> 19:01.397
Really?

19:01.399 --> 19:03.483
You know your girlfriend's
new boyfriend, Nick?

19:03.485 --> 19:04.517
Yeah.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.653
I'm his
soon-to-be ex-wife.

19:07.388 --> 19:09.872
I'll just
let you two talk.

19:09.874 --> 19:12.086
Oh, oh... you know, I-I

19:12.111 --> 19:14.462
can see what Walden's
trying to do here,

19:14.463 --> 19:17.463
and he means well,
but, um, I-I don't know

19:17.465 --> 19:18.864
that I'm emotionally
ready to jump

19:18.866 --> 19:20.700
back into the relation...
How do you feel about revenge sex?

19:20.702 --> 19:22.001
Big fan. I'll
get the check.

19:35.047 --> 19:37.182
Well, well, well.

19:37.184 --> 19:39.734
Look who's doing
the walk of shame.

19:39.736 --> 19:42.153
More like the stride of pride.

19:43.222 --> 19:45.440
Guess who heard
"Oh, God, right there"

19:45.442 --> 19:47.826
multiple times last night?

19:47.828 --> 19:48.893
Not Nick.

19:48.895 --> 19:50.411
Well,
congratulations.

19:50.413 --> 19:52.013
I'm very happy
for you.

19:52.015 --> 19:54.249
I have you to thank you it.
Ah, I didn't do anything.

19:54.251 --> 19:56.618
Well, tracking Allie down
couldn't have been easy.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.735
It wasn't that hard.

19:57.737 --> 19:59.087
When we were
outside Lyndsey's house,

19:59.089 --> 20:01.039
she was parked right behind us.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.509
Which is ironic,
because last night I was parked

20:04.511 --> 20:07.679
behind her...
I got it, I got it.

20:07.681 --> 20:09.797
I'm happy you're
feeling better.

20:09.799 --> 20:10.982
Oh, yeah.

20:10.984 --> 20:13.818
And let me tell you,
revenge sex is way better

20:13.820 --> 20:16.137
than revenge masturbation.

20:18.824 --> 20:22.560
Course, there's no reason
you can't do both.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.968
Oh, God, why am I eating
on this table?
