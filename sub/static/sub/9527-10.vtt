WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.586
Uh-oh. Oh, oh.

00:03.671 --> 00:04.754
Jordan!

00:04.838 --> 00:05.838
Oh, nice block!

00:05.923 --> 00:07.423
Get out of my house, Caesar.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.300
More like a studio apartment,
really, but...

00:09.385 --> 00:10.760
Okay. Okay, okay.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.929
Get ready for the Patrick Kane
of the roller game.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.348
Yeah, right,
more like Joe Nut Sakic.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.433
Whoa.
Make it. Take it.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.810
That doesn't count.
That doesn't count.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.812
-What are you doing?
-Fast break, going for it, baby.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.939
-Fast break to what?
-DeMamp off DeMamp.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.857
-Fast break to what?
-Oh, he's picking up speed.

00:24.942 --> 00:25.983
Ow!

00:26.068 --> 00:27.026
Oh!

00:33.200 --> 00:34.867
I hurted my dick.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.289
I'm fresh

00:41.750 --> 00:43.668
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

00:43.752 --> 00:45.378
Gotta be fresh

00:48.048 --> 00:52.093
Dude, no one can score on me.
I'm a fricking brick wall.

00:52.177 --> 00:55.555
Seriously, you are, but you bit it
pretty hard out there. You okay?

00:55.639 --> 01:00.560
Dude, no one could score on me.
I'm a fricking brick wall.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.395
-Yeah, you just said that.
-Yeah.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.480
Really?
Oh, you know what?

01:04.565 --> 01:06.274
I might have
another concussion.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.735
Stacks on stacks, right?
Beer me.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.320
Hello, hello, everybody.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.990
Get ready to hit 88 miles an hour,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.784
'cause '80s movie trivia is about to begin!

01:16.869 --> 01:20.329
The table with the most correct answers
wins the grand prize.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.415
I bet it's a Casio keyboard.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.499
-Oh.
-That'd be good.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.543
Ders, you know a lot about, like,
stupid '80s movies, right?

01:25.627 --> 01:28.921
-'Cause you're so old?
-Yes, I do know my '80s flicks like whoa,

01:29.006 --> 01:34.385
so consider that grand prize
"on lock dizzle."

01:34.928 --> 01:36.596
Ders, we are your best friends.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.098
Never, ever say "lock dizzle" ever again.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.100
All right, here we go. First question.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.603
In this 1986 action film,

01:43.687 --> 01:47.273
wrestler-turned-actor Jesse Ventura
"ain't got time to bleed."

01:48.525 --> 01:51.027
Predator. And it was '87,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.196
you plaid shirt wearing fucking idiot.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.908
"That's not a knife,"
that's our reigning champs

01:56.992 --> 01:59.619
with the first correct answer.
Next question.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.413
In what 1983 film, starring Tom Cruise

02:02.498 --> 02:04.081
and Joey "Pants" Pantoliano...

02:05.918 --> 02:07.877
Risky Business.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.505
- Correct.
- Yes! Yes!

02:10.589 --> 02:12.256
- Suck our dicks!

02:12.341 --> 02:13.758
Sorry. Two for two.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.134
- Next question.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.261
--John Hughes. John Hughes.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.429
John Cusack.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.555
Joan Cusack.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.849
Corey... Feldman?

02:21.934 --> 02:23.267
--"Aloha, Mr. Hand."

02:23.352 --> 02:26.145
--Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.190
The Triple Lindy.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.859
A Chinese girl with green eyes.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.903
Critters.
Spores, molds, and fungus?

02:34.363 --> 02:37.490
"Freeze, you diseased
rhinoceros pizzle."

02:37.658 --> 02:40.660
All right, that is it.
Game over.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.911
- Yes! Whoo!
- Our reigning champs

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621
have been dethroned by...

02:43.705 --> 02:46.290
Shut up. Shut up real quick.
What's the grand prize?

02:46.375 --> 02:50.211
The board game that inspired
the classic '80s movie, Clue.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.963
-Oh, hell yeah, dude, sweet.
-Clue. Dude, dope.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.006
Clue, a board game.
We don't need a fricking clue!

02:54.091 --> 02:55.716
You need a clue, man!

02:55.801 --> 02:59.095
Where's the Casio keyboard?
Where is it?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.346
Okay.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.306
Whole thing's a fricking...

03:02.391 --> 03:05.935
It's a scam. It's a scam,
and I refuse to be scammed.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.605
Adam's out.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.818
Shouldn't have those on in here.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.030
Ders, it's fricking raining, okay?

03:18.115 --> 03:20.867
Can you go get the car?
I refuse to be dampened.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.743
-I'm not gonna...
-Hey.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.704
Nice work.

03:24.788 --> 03:28.207
How about we, uh,
take this to the streets?

03:28.292 --> 03:29.709
Okay. What, street names

03:29.793 --> 03:31.711
or, like, construction
and engineering questions?

03:31.962 --> 03:34.463
Doesn't matter to me.
My uncle works for Caltrans.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.631
I got a leg up.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.885
I'm talking about street racing.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.929
Yeah, no, I knew. Also, I get
the whole Better Off Dead reference.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.725
Funny, but can you not turn off
the whole '80s thing?

03:45.809 --> 03:48.060
I'd like you to just go click off.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.063
And I want you to take that
and go click on and keep it on,

03:51.148 --> 03:52.607
and even turn up the volume on it.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.650
-But I just...
-I want you to turn up the volume

03:54.735 --> 03:58.029
because we are having a trivia night
at our house tomorrow,

03:58.113 --> 04:01.365
and the grand prize,
it's gonna be grand.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.533
What's the grand prize?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.952
The grand prize is...

04:06.496 --> 04:07.955
A Predator statue.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.207
Yep, it's a Predator statue,

04:10.292 --> 04:12.209
and you better come correct.
Bring your A-game

04:12.294 --> 04:15.046
with a $20 buy-in,
because my boy Ders...

04:15.130 --> 04:16.505
-Hey.
-He ain't playin'.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.507
- What?
- What?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.217
-He is playing.
-Okay.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.094
But he ain't playin',
you know what I mean?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.721
All right. See you tomorrow.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.222
"Neo maxi zoom dweebie."

04:25.307 --> 04:26.849
Breakfast Club.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.017
Nice.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.560
-I knew that.
-Really good. "Clever girl."

04:29.645 --> 04:31.020
-That was good.
-I hate you.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.730
Jurassic Park, that's a movie too.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.191
Hey, Adam. What are you doing?

04:36.151 --> 04:38.736
Oh, Anders. Click, click, click.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.279
Is there anything fricking in there?

04:40.364 --> 04:42.448
We charge them to play trivia.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.992
We say we bought the statue,
but we don't,

04:45.077 --> 04:47.620
and since you're such
an '80s nerd, we win.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.996
We're scammers.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.791
-Yeah.
-Dude, no one scores on me.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.626
I'm like a fricking brick wall.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.505
Hey, guys, um...

04:58.215 --> 05:00.466
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.469
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.346
-Pretty good.
-We're doing, like, a Princess Bride thing.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.722
Here's your Westley costume.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.849
I got bad news.
I got to go to the office,

05:08.934 --> 05:10.810
so, you're gonna have do Inigo

05:10.894 --> 05:12.645
and the "inconceivable" guy
without me.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.399
Well, it's "inconceivable"
that you don't realize

05:16.483 --> 05:18.484
that I'm Andre the Giant
from Princess Bride.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.652
- Yeah. Come on.
- Obviously.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.237
And secondly...

05:22.489 --> 05:24.657
I am mad at you for some reason,
that I just forgot.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.950
What is the reason?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.493
Alice just emailed me and she's like,

05:27.577 --> 05:28.911
"You got to come
into the office, stretch,"

05:28.996 --> 05:31.122
and I'm like, "Me, her,
in the office alone?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.748
"That's a recipe for getting
a lot of work done."

05:32.833 --> 05:34.625
So, I'm gonna go in and help her.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.668
-Sorry.
-That sounds wrong.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.794
Anders, where are you going?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.504
-We got a scam, dude.
-Anders!

05:38.588 --> 05:40.756
Okay, well, we are screwed dudes.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.216
What the hell?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.929
Cool, right?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.472
It's Falkor the Luck Dragon.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.182
Yeah, we were gonna
do NeverEnding Story,

05:50.267 --> 05:51.934
but then we couldn't decide
on who's gonna be Atreyu

05:52.019 --> 05:54.854
or who's gonna be Bastian,
so we went with Princess Bride.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.981
We did, which sucks,
because it's so obvious

05:57.065 --> 05:59.775
I'm Atreyu, you know?
He has long hair. I have long hair.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.819
He doesn't understand.
He's not part of the track.

06:01.903 --> 06:05.322
How can I be Bastian, Blake,
when I can barely read?

06:05.407 --> 06:08.034
Hey, guys, my car looks insane!

06:08.535 --> 06:12.371
I can't believe you pulled this off,
to be honest, first and foremost.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.456
-Thank you.
-Adderall.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.623
-Tons of it.
-Yeah.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.708
This is from our couch.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.209
Yeah, it's the inside of the couch, a lot of that.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.962
I can't drive a car like this today.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.630
Or any day.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.382
Never mind, just...

06:23.467 --> 06:24.717
-What are you doing?
-I have to go.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.594
-Why aren't you happy?
-Okay, we have work to do.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.387
Sorry, we have a scam to scheme.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.639
--Okay, very '80s of you

06:30.724 --> 06:32.183
to be the responsible nerd of the crew.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.060
-Careful with the tongue.
-Bitch.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.561
The tail looks great, I'll say that.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.898
-That does look awesome. Great idea.
-Wow, what a fricking bitch.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.483
What? I guess we have to go in there

06:40.567 --> 06:43.694
and read the back of a bunch of DVDs
and train for this thing.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.322
Reading. Training.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.325
That sounds like a very Bastian thing to say.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.245
And I walk away, like Atreyu.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.537
- You ready?
-Yes.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.665
Although you could just give me the answers
to the questions you're gonna ask, right?

07:37.749 --> 07:38.791
-Yep, let's do that. Good call.
-Yes.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.835
-This was fun, though.
-I hated it.

07:49.469 --> 07:54.265
All right, hello, and welcome
to the Hallman House '80s Trivia Night,

07:54.349 --> 07:56.475
where the grand prizes are actually grand.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.811
Okay, you know why you're here.
I know why I'm here.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.521
To win...

08:02.399 --> 08:04.942
A life-size Predator statue.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.403
Yes, that's what
I'm talking about.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.696
Great. All right.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.407
First question. Hands on your dingers.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.784
In the movie Stand By Me,
what was the name

08:13.869 --> 08:18.497
of River Phoenix's
character's older brother?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.333
Bobby Phoenix.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.501
- No.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.919
-Jeff Phoenix.
-No.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.254
--Phoenix Sons.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.256
Mmm... Nope.
Now you're drifting.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.633
-Shaq.
-No. What?

08:29.718 --> 08:31.135
Okay, you know what?

08:31.219 --> 08:33.429
I think the concussions are
starting to stack up against me.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.389
--Eyeball Chambers.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.016
-Correct.
-That's my boy right there.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.267
All day long, baby.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.643
-Ooh.
-Ow!

08:39.728 --> 08:45.149
All right, uh,
time for question numero two.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.276
Plutonium.
Barry Manilow's wardrobe.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.944
Alabama Black Snake.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.113
"Rolls-Royce and the grill alone
costs 12 grand."

08:51.198 --> 08:54.116
"I'll buy that for a dollar."
Short Circuit 2.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.910
Toontown and it was called "dip."

08:56.244 --> 08:57.411
Hardbodies.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.746
"It was nothing like that,
penis breath."

08:58.955 --> 09:00.497
--Yeah!

09:00.582 --> 09:03.375
-Mmm.
-Okay, uh, question 51.

09:03.460 --> 09:07.922
Uh, leads us to round... Two.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.883
It's gonna begin shortly
at TelAmeriCorp.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.135
We're not going anywhere.
Read the next question, bro.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.096
No, you are gonna go somewhere
if you want this bomb-ass statue.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.890
Unless you guys are forfeiting.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.060
In which case, there's
a "no money back" policy.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.561
-That's a "gwarantee."
-That's right.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.146
Fine. Whatever.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.522
Okay, where is this place?

09:25.607 --> 09:26.982
-Okay.
-It's right up the street.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.192
You know the Target
where that lady got murdered?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.318
Cool.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.654
It was a coupla years...
That was a few years ago.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.447
If Ders doesn't bail us out,
we are screwed.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.866
Oh, he will. He will.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.618
Yo, Karl. Can we get a ride?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.163
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No problem.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.248
- Cool.
- Awesome, dude.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.041
What are my weaknesses?

09:44.125 --> 09:48.087
Um... I'm too passionate, you know?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.547
I've been called a workaholic.

09:50.632 --> 09:54.218
And I'm on time entirely too often.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.267
Punctual. That's good, that's good.

10:01.977 --> 10:05.479
And, uh, where do you see
yourself in, say, five years?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.569
Richard. May I call you Richard?

10:13.363 --> 10:16.532
I got to tell ya, if I'm honest,
I see myself as branch manager,

10:16.616 --> 10:18.826
and I know that's your job,

10:19.911 --> 10:21.787
but I feel like I could do it better

10:21.871 --> 10:24.707
with a little something
I call the Ders Effect.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.502
"Ders Effect?" That's a new one.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.131
I'll tell ya,
I've never had my job put in jeopardy

10:32.215 --> 10:34.717
by an interviewee, but...

10:36.094 --> 10:39.763
It's the wake-up call I needed,
I'll be honest, Mr. Holmvik.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.432
So you're hired.

10:41.725 --> 10:46.061
In fact, I'm gonna give you double pay
and full "bennies," so... Hi.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.315
-Howdy.
-Hey.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.067
Hey, uh,
what are you guys doing here?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.569
What are you doing here?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.154
Wait, are you doing
a podcast right now?

10:55.238 --> 10:56.405
-No.
-Oh, my gosh.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.365
-You were about to 'bate it.
-That's what I was figuring.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.491
- Oh.
- Wasn't gonna...

10:59.576 --> 11:00.784
What happened at the house?

11:00.869 --> 11:02.911
Oh, well, the scam nose-doved,

11:02.996 --> 11:06.373
'cause you ditched us
like a real dickhead.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.791
So, we brought the game to you.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.335
Everybody's in the conference room.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.795
What? No, no, no, no.
This can't happen.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.130
Oh, no, don't worry,
you know, it's all good.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.675
We're actually here to help you finish
your stupid little Alice job stuff

11:16.760 --> 11:18.260
and then we're gonna
send you in the room

11:18.345 --> 11:20.512
and you're gonna just
clean up, buddy.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.764
-Rack 'em and stack 'em.
-Come on.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.098
-Let's go.
-I can't.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.725
-That's the mask.
-I...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.894
Alice didn't email me
about working here, okay?

11:26.978 --> 11:29.897
I'm here because I'm about to interview
with another branch manager.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.107
There's an opening
sales director position,

11:32.192 --> 11:33.233
and I wanted it.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.153
Blake... Punch this man.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.906
Okay, wait, we don't need
a sales director, okay?

11:38.990 --> 11:42.034
What we need right now
is a child who sat

11:42.118 --> 11:44.703
in front of a TV, unloved,
for hours upon hours

11:44.788 --> 11:49.208
until he mutated into the '80s movie
trivia genius that sits before us now.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.043
I take that as a compliment,
okay, buddy?

11:51.127 --> 11:53.212
And guess what?
Best thing about the whole trivia scam

11:53.296 --> 11:54.630
is that it doesn't have to happen.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.131
So, I'm gonna go squash it right now.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.383
-Why?
-No, no, no.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.135
-Don't. We're scammers, Anders, just admit it.
-No, Anders, do not!

12:00.220 --> 12:02.721
- Hey, get, stop!
- Hi, gang.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.932
Sorry for the mix-up,
but there's no trivia here today,

12:05.016 --> 12:06.892
so you guys can all just head on out.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.435
-There definitely is, so...
-Don't listen to him.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.312
What's the matter? Scared you
won't win the statue from us?

12:10.438 --> 12:13.982
If there was a statue, I would eviscerate
you fools, do you understand me?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.984
But since there's not,
I guess I'll be seeing you.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.569
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.405
What are you saying?
There was never a statue?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.990
Yeah, there totally is.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.659
Okay, there was a statue.
Remember? At the house?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.244
You see it?

12:25.328 --> 12:27.413
I suggest you get it here now

12:27.497 --> 12:30.749
before I start looking around this place
for a new grand prize.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.960
There's no grand prizes here.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.461
- No, no, no. Don't...
- Fax machine.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.547
No, no, no, no. Please, don't. Oh!

12:36.631 --> 12:37.840
-Oh!
-Hey! Hey!

12:37.924 --> 12:39.675
-Ooh.
-You want to get physical?

12:39.759 --> 12:40.801
Let's get physical.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.010
Okay! Jeez, stop!

12:42.095 --> 12:43.637
Get off!
Get your hands off of me!

12:43.721 --> 12:45.222
Get off of me, bro!

12:45.306 --> 12:47.683
Get the Predator statue here, now.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.226
In the meantime, we'll be in here

12:49.310 --> 12:51.854
slamming beers and trashing shit.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.440
- You idiots.
- No, damn it!

12:54.524 --> 12:55.941
Get him, Adam!

12:56.025 --> 12:57.484
What are you guys doing to me?

12:57.569 --> 12:58.902
What are you doing to us, man?

12:58.987 --> 13:00.112
-No, I asked first.
-We asked second.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.321
What are you doing to us, man?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.657
And you bailed first, on the scam.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.368
Everything doesn't have to be a scam, okay?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.786
The whole reason I want this job

13:07.871 --> 13:09.955
is so that I don't have to trick people
out of money anymore.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.957
I'll just have money. Is that crazy?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.542
It'll be in my pockets,
I'll pull it out,

13:13.626 --> 13:15.002
and I'll give it to you guys
if you want it.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.462
Trickle-down economics.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.964
I know that. I watch Wolf Blitzer.
Just 'cause his name's so cool.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.967
But, guess what, there's three
neo-greaser Asian dudes in there

13:22.051 --> 13:23.469
destroying our office right now,

13:23.553 --> 13:25.429
and our jobs are flying
out the fricking window.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.139
Oh, yeah.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.225
I've got an idea,
but it's a little scammish.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.060
-That's cool.
-Fine, I don't care.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.021
Let's just do it fast, because
the branch manager guy's

13:34.105 --> 13:35.314
-gonna be here any minute.
-Okay.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.483
-Sorry, I'm early.
-Richard!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.619
-That's Mr. Ottmar, Anders.
-"Ah-nders."

13:49.162 --> 13:50.162
That's what I said.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.123
So, shall we head inside?
Have a little chat?

13:53.374 --> 13:56.919
Yeah, uh, actually,
the door is locked.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.922
It's been a little finicky
lately so, ugh, but...

14:00.340 --> 14:03.133
-Locksmiths. We're here to...
-We're... We work... That's what...

14:03.218 --> 14:04.510
These are our uniforms.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.719
Yeah, so they're gonna...
Shut up.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.887
-They're gonna...
-Ye olde locksmith.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.223
Just... Maybe go fix the door.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.100
So, while that's happening,
maybe we talk...

14:13.144 --> 14:14.853
In there?

14:14.938 --> 14:18.023
Uh... Sure.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.441
-Yeah. Yes.
-Okay. Yes, great.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.193
-After you.
-Oh, no, please.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.861
-I insist.
-No, I... It's your office.

14:22.946 --> 14:23.987
All right, car, but yeah.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.239
-Right, okay, fine.
-Great.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.949
Well, I guess I should have gone first.
Sorry, I'll get the door.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.868
Hey, you should hire my boy Ders.
He's hella smart.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.913
Okay, these guys want a Predator statue?

14:32.997 --> 14:34.456
Let's give it to 'em.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.669
Ah, the hockey stuff.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.212
I don't get it.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.882
Tell me a few of your weaknesses.

14:44.801 --> 14:49.054
Just pick one thing about yourself
that you really need to work on.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.100
Yeah. I could be on time less.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.396
-So, you want to be late?
-Yeah.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.191
Hey, you big, dumb idiots!
We got the grand prize, the Predator statue.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.276
Come collect it.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.361
Show me. Where is it?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.154
Are you blind?
It's right there.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.700
It's real.
It's legit.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.118
Great, come on out, individually.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.620
- Stop!
- How stupid do you think we are?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.998
We can see
it's your dumbass friend dressed up.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.165
Whoa.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.626
Is that a Falkor car?

15:20.003 --> 15:21.837
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, it is.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.088
-We made it ourselves.
-We did.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.257
We're thinking of taking photos
and putting it on Pinterest.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.759
It's, like, do-it-yourself.
It's like, you can also do this

15:27.844 --> 15:29.177
if you have the time
and the willpower.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.096
What's the deal?
You a big NeverEnding Story fan?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.056
It's a good movie. What? Oh.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.933
Does a rockbiter bite rocks?

15:35.018 --> 15:37.102
That's a cool tattoo.
It looks like, uh...

15:37.186 --> 15:38.687
Like a gigantic gaping butthole.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.315
Unique. You're a unique person.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.108
You guys like drag racing, right?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.526
We've been known to drift.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.863
How about we race for pink slips?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.115
You win, you get the Fal-car.

15:50.199 --> 15:53.201
We win, you guys just
bounce on out of here,

15:53.286 --> 15:57.456
and then sort of admit that I'm the most
Atreyu-looking dude you've ever met.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.707
Great, deal. Let's do it.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.875
- Okay.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.546
Rude!

16:04.672 --> 16:05.964
You'd have my job?

16:06.049 --> 16:10.093
That's right, and it would only take me
five years to take it. Impressed?

16:10.178 --> 16:12.763
Why would I hire someone
who wants to take my job away?

16:12.930 --> 16:15.766
I'm smarter than I look,
and I know that I look pretty smart.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.684
I'm not sure I get that exactly.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.728
Hey, guys. Still in the middle of this.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.314
No, I get that, I totally do,
but we got to race these movie buffs

16:22.398 --> 16:23.857
or they're gonna knock out our teeth out.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.317
I think I'll be leaving now.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.443
-Hey!
-Ahh!

16:26.527 --> 16:27.986
Don't make us kick your asses.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.655
Let's go!

16:30.156 --> 16:31.823
I think I'll be staying now.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.617
What if I gave you a Westley mask?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.827
Help us, Dersy.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.747
As you wish.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.964
-First one past the fence, bro.
-That's right.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.676
Luck Dragon's about to be mine, baby.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.968
All right.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.261
Wait, what's he talking about?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.681
Oh. Okay, on Jenny's go.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.057
Okay, Jenny!

17:03.606 --> 17:04.856
-Wait, wait, wait! Oh, no!
-Stop!

17:04.941 --> 17:05.941
Wait, what?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.614
Speed bumps, they're not
just for hockey anymore.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.581
You lose.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.211
Whoo!

17:26.295 --> 17:27.838
-Yeah!
-That was cool, right?

17:27.922 --> 17:29.548
- That worked.
- Oh, yes.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.051
That was the most interesting interview
I have ever been a part of.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.595
-That's great, right?
-That is great, mm-hmm.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.057
Sir, I think you'd be a fool not to hire Ders.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.352
If there's anything we can say
for him, he's extremely loyal.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.272
He is loyal. That is true.
He's like a dog.

17:45.356 --> 17:48.150
He will lick the peanut butter
off those corporate nut sacks.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.234
-Okay, Adam.
-Yep.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.444
-Yeah, Adam, you did...
-Okay, so...

17:50.528 --> 17:51.862
- Thanks, guys.
- So, yeah.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.989
- We'll, uh, leave you with that.
- All right. Okay.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.282
There's our endorsement.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.825
- Yep. Goodbye.
- Best friends.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.665
-So...
-Can I cut you off, sir?

18:04.876 --> 18:06.918
Because I don't want you
to waste your time.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.337
I'm not gonna accept your offer.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.173
All right, I just...

18:11.257 --> 18:12.799
I can't leave these guys
for the bright lights

18:12.884 --> 18:15.552
of TAC San Bernardino. I can't.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.263
And I've actually got a few tips
for you about interviewing.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.768
Anders, I am so not offering you a job.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.854
I don't, uh...
See you at the Christmas party.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.485
Oh, and by the way, I just texted Alice.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.945
She's on her way over here
right now to sort out

18:34.030 --> 18:35.989
whatever it is you've been
doing here today.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.741
Wait.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.045
-Boom chaka-laka!
-Ooh! Big baby in ya business.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.505
You are such a good jumper.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.006
Hey, you guys,
I didn't take the job.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.008
-Oh, good. That's great.
-Yes.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.885
That's great, 'cause
that dude was a perv, man.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.262
He probably would have tried
to finger your binghole or something.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.764
-Yeah.
-He smells like vitamins, right?

19:00.848 --> 19:03.517
-Right.
-Also, he didn't offer me the job, either.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.352
And in other news, the bitch snitched.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.187
Alice is on her way here right now.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.605
-What?
-Yeah.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.733
Okay, well, we better clean
this place up before she gets here.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.360
Go, go, go, go, go.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.249
-Awesome, we did it.
-Whoo! Whoo!

19:27.583 --> 19:28.750
Ohh.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.002
Wait a second. Why are we here?

19:31.087 --> 19:34.923
When she walks in, she's gonna
want to know why we're here.

19:36.259 --> 19:37.467
Put it back! Put it back!

19:37.552 --> 19:38.969
Put it back. Put it back.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.428
Wait, no.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.222
Put the '80s stuff back. Don't trash it.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.015
Yes.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.863
Hey, what the hell are you
three idiots doing here?

19:57.947 --> 20:01.700
I just got a text from Richard Ottmar
saying that the office is trashed.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.536
What? He called our '80s
trivia party decorations trash?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.413
Okay, that's on him,
and actually, I'm offended.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.164
I'm sorry, '80s trivia party?

20:08.249 --> 20:09.624
Yeah, you just...

20:09.709 --> 20:10.750
- Oh, you know what?
- Oh!

20:10.835 --> 20:12.377
- Aw!
- I feel so bad for you

20:12.461 --> 20:13.879
'cause you ruined our surprise.

20:13.963 --> 20:14.963
We were gonna do, like,
a fun lunchtime thing...

20:15.047 --> 20:16.089
-Surprise.
-Surprise.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.382
...for everybody on Monday,
and this was it.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.886
Oh. That's actually kind of sweet.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.221
What if we just, like,
took the whole afternoon off

20:23.306 --> 20:25.348
and we all, like,
got to know each other

20:25.433 --> 20:27.601
like The Breakfast Club,
or something like that?

20:27.685 --> 20:30.228
-Yeah.
-She's so cool.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.480
Listen closely, bozos.

20:32.690 --> 20:36.276
Okay, there are no surprises
in my office, okay?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.236
I cannot believe I left
the GarageBand workshop

20:38.321 --> 20:39.571
at the Apple Store for this.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.531
Okay, take all this crap down
and get out.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.868
Sorry.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.121
So, that worked.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.041
We're still alive.
We're still alive.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.125
We got this.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.835
We still work here.
We've got our jobs.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.379
We've got this. No?

21:01.928 --> 21:05.263
-I noticed your tie. What is that, Merona?
-Yes, it is.

21:05.348 --> 21:08.099
You got that at the Target
where the woman was murdered?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.434
-Yes.
-Oh, my God.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.603
Yes, that was...
I got, like, 12 of them.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.146
The sales after that.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.773
-I know.
-It was incredible.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.858
But, boy, I bought those right up.
