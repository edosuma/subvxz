00:23.649 --> 00:26.133

00:30.273 --> 00:33.274
<i>...Mercury spacecraft

<i>'Cause I don't like your face.</i>

00:47.740 --> 00:49.606
<i>Hey.</i>

00:49.642 --> 00:52.609
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

00:52.645 --> 00:55.245
<i>I want...</i>

00:55.281 --> 00:58.782
<i>I want you to see something.</i>

01:06.809 --> 01:10.227
<i>Kurt's brain
was just constantly going.</i>

01:10.262 --> 01:13.347
<i>He was always thinking
about something.</i>

01:13.399 --> 01:15.683
<i>I mean,
there was always something going on.</i>

01:15.735 --> 01:17.184
<i>You could just see it.</i>

01:17.236 --> 01:19.737
Party on, Wayne!

01:19.772 --> 01:22.156
It was awe-inspiring,
but it was like,

01:22.191 --> 01:26.243
"Oh, well, I guess I'm not...
You know, I guess I'm not all that special."

01:26.278 --> 01:29.446
But, you know...
But then, as I grew up,

01:29.498 --> 01:32.499
I'm like,
I'm so glad I don't...

01:32.535 --> 01:34.284
I never got that genius brain.

01:43.512 --> 01:48.682
Maybe he just felt praise
was hard for him to take, maybe?

01:48.718 --> 01:50.551
And he didn't know
how to handle that.

01:50.603 --> 01:53.637
So he would downplay it
all the time.

01:53.639 --> 01:57.608
But that was his goal,
was to get to as perfect as he could,

01:57.643 --> 01:59.276
as good as he could get.

01:59.311 --> 02:02.813
Write as well as he could,
sing as well as he could,

02:02.865 --> 02:04.982
play as well as he could.

02:05.034 --> 02:06.867
And then when it all
came together...

02:15.995 --> 02:18.328
- It's so...
- I can't say... It's too painful.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.881
This is too painful.

02:22.551 --> 02:24.668
You're gonna make it, man.

02:25.921 --> 02:28.889
With the support
of his friends and family,

02:28.924 --> 02:30.641
he's gonna make it.

02:33.396 --> 02:35.429
And you read...
See the art, I mean,

02:35.481 --> 02:38.315
a lot of his messages
are as plain as day.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.267
You just...
I'm not even going to say what they are,

02:40.319 --> 02:41.485
but you can see it.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.772
And it's all there, and...
20/20 hindsight,

02:44.824 --> 02:46.356
you're like, "Oh, my God,
why didn't I see that?"

02:46.409 --> 02:50.527
or "I should have said something,"
but, you know, it's like...

05:23.148 --> 05:24.848

05:24.900 --> 05:26.767
<i>You know, he had the black,
horn-rimmed glasses</i>

05:26.819 --> 05:28.518
<i>and his ears
kind of stuck out a little,</i>

05:28.520 --> 05:30.737
<i>and he had the crew cut</i>

05:30.773 --> 05:34.191

05:34.193 --> 05:35.859

05:35.861 --> 05:37.444

05:39.331 --> 05:41.448

<i>I didn't know
what falling in love was,</i>

05:43.786 --> 05:45.502
<i>so I had never experienced it.</i>

05:45.537 --> 05:48.338
<i>So I just thought because I liked him,
I loved him.</i>

05:48.374 --> 05:52.042
<i>And so he got me an engagement ring,
and we got engaged.</i>

05:52.094 --> 05:53.710
<i>You know, it was fun.</i>

05:53.712 --> 05:56.713
<i>I mean, it was like,
"Okay, all those problems are behind me now.</i>

05:56.715 --> 05:58.715
<i>I'm going
to have babies."</i>

06:06.525 --> 06:08.225
<i>And I just couldn't wait
to get pregnant.</i>

06:08.227 --> 06:10.978
<i>I mean, that was the goal.</i>

06:11.030 --> 06:13.397
<i>And so I went to Dr. Ehrhart.
He said, "You're so young.</i>

06:13.449 --> 06:16.733
<i>You just need to get on your
feet with being a housewife."</i>

06:16.735 --> 06:18.652
<i>And, you know,</i>

06:18.704 --> 06:20.704
<i>I just didn't listen
to anybody.</i>

06:22.041 --> 06:25.075
<i>I used to think,
"Why did I marry Don Cobain?"</i>

06:25.127 --> 06:29.746
<i>And it's like,
"No, everything really did happen for a reason."</i>

06:31.800 --> 06:33.250
<i>Kurt had to be born.</i>

06:33.302 --> 06:35.002

constantly.</i>

07:05.751 --> 07:08.785

what a magnet he was.</i>

07:08.787 --> 07:10.754
<i>People just came to him.</i>

07:55.384 --> 07:59.169
<i>I was head over heels
in love with that child.</i>

08:01.924 --> 08:06.843
<i>He was so kind and so
worried about people.</i>

08:06.845 --> 08:11.348
<i>You know,
if they were okay or if somebody got hurt.</i>

08:14.186 --> 08:16.686
<i>And then, on top of that,</i>

08:16.688 --> 08:20.240
<i>he started singing
and playing guitar.</i>

08:20.275 --> 08:23.744

he drew all the time.</i>

09:28.427 --> 09:30.427
<i>I had this old rocking chair</i>

09:30.479 --> 09:32.262
<i>in the corner
of the front room.</i>

09:32.314 --> 09:35.932
<i>He'd be upside down

09:35.934 --> 09:37.734

09:37.769 --> 09:40.770
<i>and his feet up on the back

09:40.772 --> 09:44.074
<i>going 90 miles an hour in it,
going so fast,</i>

09:44.109 --> 09:45.992

the back of the wall.</i>

12:42.454 --> 12:44.621

13:04.893 --> 13:07.310

came outside

13:09.648 --> 13:13.483

<i>And I said,
"This is not going to happen anymore."</i>

13:17.572 --> 13:21.157
<i>And so I took him over
to his dad's house.</i>

13:23.829 --> 13:25.995
She couldn't handle him...

13:27.215 --> 13:29.632
So I took him.

13:29.668 --> 13:33.303
I liked it, really,
you know, having him,

13:33.338 --> 13:35.472
him and I together like that.

13:35.497 --> 13:36.918

13:36.942 --> 13:39.008

13:39.044 --> 13:42.078
that I was never gonna
get married again.

13:43.248 --> 13:45.849
And I think he took that
for a word.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.853
<i>Then I met Jennifer
and we got married,</i>

13:49.888 --> 13:52.288
<i>and, you know,
he had a stepbrother and sister</i>

13:52.324 --> 13:55.658
<i>and then our son Chad.</i>

13:55.694 --> 13:59.279
He wanted to be in a family,
period.

13:59.331 --> 14:03.099
And I felt that
just from the beginning.

14:03.117 --> 14:04.280
_

14:04.302 --> 14:06.236
<i>The game nights that we had,</i>

14:06.271 --> 14:08.304
<i>that was really
important to him.</i>

14:08.340 --> 14:11.091
You know, we didn't want to
do it on a Wednesday night.

14:11.126 --> 14:14.043
You know, he'd say,
"Nope, we have to. That's what we..."

14:14.045 --> 14:18.181
Just I could feel that he
really liked that time,

14:18.216 --> 14:20.850
but he always wanted to win.

14:20.886 --> 14:23.770
And if he didn't win,
he was mad.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.974
<i>He wanted to be the most loved,</i>

14:28.026 --> 14:31.895
and it just wasn't
the ideal world

14:31.947 --> 14:34.564
that he thought
a family should be.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.033
<i>So he just decided</i>

14:37.068 --> 14:40.870
<i>he wasn't going to do
anything anybody said.</i>

14:40.906 --> 14:43.540
<i>He'd just lay on the couch
and watch TV,</i>

14:43.575 --> 14:46.576
<i>go down in his room
and play the guitar.</i>

14:46.628 --> 14:50.630
And then he started just doing
really mean things to the kids,

14:50.665 --> 14:53.550
and then it just got so...

14:53.585 --> 14:55.835
I think it was kind of
my fault in a way,

14:55.887 --> 14:57.637
because I couldn't
deal with it anymore.

14:57.672 --> 14:59.722
<i>And I told Don</i>

14:59.758 --> 15:01.891
<i>he's going to have
to get out of the house.</i>

15:05.597 --> 15:08.014
<i>He went to Wendy's
brother's for a while,</i>

15:08.066 --> 15:09.599
<i>then with my mom and dad.</i>

15:09.601 --> 15:11.935
He lived with them for a while.

15:11.937 --> 15:14.404
You know, then come back to us

15:14.439 --> 15:17.273
and still have problems.

15:17.275 --> 15:20.243
It was like nobody...
After a couple weeks,

15:20.278 --> 15:21.911
they wanted him out.

15:23.999 --> 15:27.700
<i>I think the sad part
of the whole thing</i>

15:27.752 --> 15:31.171
<i>is that Kurt just really
wanted to be with his mom.</i>

18:49.621 --> 18:53.206
<i>In a community that stresses
macho male sexual stories</i>

18:53.241 --> 18:55.408
<i>as a highlight
of all conversation,</i>

18:55.460 --> 18:58.044
<i>I was an underdeveloped,
immature little dude</i>

18:58.079 --> 19:01.330
<i>that never got laid
and was constantly razzed.</i>

19:01.332 --> 19:04.133
<i>Oh, poor little kid.</i>

19:04.169 --> 19:07.003
<i>It bothered me,
probably more so because I was horny,</i>

19:07.005 --> 19:09.472
<i>and frequently had
to make up stories like,</i>

19:09.507 --> 19:12.175
<i>"When I went on vacation,
I met this chick</i>

19:12.227 --> 19:14.010
<i>and we fucked
and she loved it."</i>

19:14.012 --> 19:15.228
<i>Et cetera, et cetera.</i>

19:17.065 --> 19:19.232
<i>This typical pubescent problem</i>

19:19.267 --> 19:21.267
<i>was in effect during the
height of my problems</i>

19:21.319 --> 19:23.319
<i>with my father and stepmom,</i>

19:23.354 --> 19:26.989
<i>you know,
the typical wicked stepmom story.</i>

19:27.025 --> 19:29.575
<i>And so I moved
to both grandparents'</i>

19:29.611 --> 19:31.611
<i>and four sets
of aunts and uncles</i>

19:31.663 --> 19:33.696
<i>and so forth and so on
within the year.</i>

19:33.698 --> 19:36.282
<i>And in eighth grade,
my mom had no choice to take me in</i>

19:36.334 --> 19:37.917
<i>because my dad packed my stuff</i>

19:37.952 --> 19:41.370
<i>and drove me to her house in the
morning and left me there.</i>

19:42.874 --> 19:44.841
<i>She was pissed.</i>

19:44.876 --> 19:47.543
<i>I accumulated
quite a healthy complex,</i>

19:47.595 --> 19:49.429
<i>not to mention a complexion.</i>

19:49.464 --> 19:53.683
<i>Then one day I discovered the most
ultimate form of expression ever...</i>

19:53.718 --> 19:55.218
<i>Marijuana.</i>

19:55.270 --> 19:56.636
<i>Oh, boy, pot.</i>

19:56.688 --> 19:58.104
<i>I could escape all day long</i>

19:58.139 --> 20:00.556
<i>and not have routine
nervous breakdowns.</i>

20:14.739 --> 20:18.374
<i>Trevor was a guy I hated,
but resorted to becoming friends with</i>

20:18.409 --> 20:21.294
<i>because he was the only person
I could get pot from.</i>

20:21.329 --> 20:23.329
<i>He was the kingpin.</i>

20:23.381 --> 20:25.381
<i>Trevor "Ace" John Dernan...</i>

20:25.416 --> 20:28.751
<i>All white trash,
lowlife scum of the Earth according to the jocks...</i>

20:28.753 --> 20:31.137
<i>Had been going to this
girl's house after school</i>

20:31.172 --> 20:32.805
<i>and they invited me.</i>

20:32.841 --> 20:35.641
<i>We got to the door
and a very fat girl let us in.</i>

20:35.677 --> 20:37.844
<i>It wasn't obvious to me
for over an hour</i>

20:37.896 --> 20:39.729
<i>that this girl
seemed kind of quiet</i>

20:39.764 --> 20:41.264
<i>until one of the guys
pointed out</i>

20:41.316 --> 20:43.766
<i>that she was in
a special ed class.</i>

20:43.818 --> 20:48.488
<i>I'm sure a lot of kids would call her
a "retard" and some just "slow."</i>

20:48.523 --> 20:50.106
<i>And at the time and
still to this day,</i>

20:50.108 --> 20:53.075
<i>I would call her "quiet and illiterate,"
but not retarded.</i>

20:54.612 --> 20:56.445
<i>The object of the guys
who'd been going there</i>

20:56.498 --> 20:58.114
<i>for the past month
was to steal booze</i>

20:58.166 --> 21:01.334
<i>from the downstairs
basement den of her house.</i>

21:01.369 --> 21:03.119
<i>While others distracted her,</i>

21:03.171 --> 21:04.670
<i>one would go down
and take a fifth</i>

21:04.706 --> 21:06.372
<i>and then exit out
the downstairs.</i>

21:08.126 --> 21:10.259
<i>So we did this routine
every other day</i>

21:10.295 --> 21:13.462
<i>and got away with it for,
oh, about a month.</i>

21:13.515 --> 21:15.298
<i>And during that month</i>

21:15.350 --> 21:19.302
<i>happened to be the epitome of my
mental abuse from my mother.</i>

21:19.304 --> 21:21.304
<i>It turned out that pot
didn't help me</i>

21:21.356 --> 21:23.139
<i>escape my troubles
too well anymore</i>

21:23.191 --> 21:25.358
<i>and I was actually enjoying
doing rebellious things</i>

21:25.393 --> 21:28.561
<i>like stealing booze
and busting store windows.</i>

21:28.613 --> 21:29.862
<i>And nothing ever mattered.</i>

21:29.898 --> 21:31.647
<i>I decided within
the next month,</i>

21:31.649 --> 21:33.699
<i>I'll not sit on my roof
and think about jumping,</i>

21:33.735 --> 21:35.201
<i>but I'll actually kill myself.</i>

21:35.236 --> 21:36.736
<i>And I wasn't going
out of this world</i>

21:36.788 --> 21:39.822
<i>without actually knowing
what it was like to get laid.</i>

21:43.394 --> 21:46.796
<i>So one day after school,
I went to the girl's house alone</i>

21:46.831 --> 21:47.897
<i>and invited myself in.</i>

21:47.932 --> 21:49.398
<i>And she offered me
some Twinkies,</i>

21:49.434 --> 21:52.501
<i>and I sat on her lap and I said,
"Let's fuck."</i>

21:52.537 --> 21:54.670
<i>And I touched her tits
and she went into her bedroom</i>

21:54.706 --> 21:56.672
<i>and got undressed
in front of me.</i>

21:56.708 --> 21:59.308
<i>And I watched and realized
that it was actually happening.</i>

21:59.344 --> 22:01.210
<i>So I tried to fuck her,
but didn't know how,</i>

22:01.246 --> 22:03.613
<i>and asked her if she had
ever done this before.</i>

22:03.648 --> 22:06.849
<i>And she said a lot of times,
mainly with her cousin.</i>

22:06.884 --> 22:11.087
<i>I got grossed out very heavily with how her
vagina smelled when her sweat reeked,</i>

22:11.122 --> 22:13.055
<i>so I left.</i>

22:13.091 --> 22:15.324
<i>My conscience grew to where I
couldn't go to school for a week.</i>

22:15.360 --> 22:18.461
<i>And when I went back,
I got in-house suspension for skipping.</i>

22:18.496 --> 22:20.162
<i>And that day,
the girl's father came in,</i>

22:20.198 --> 22:24.634
<i>screaming and accusing someone of
taking advantage of his daughter.</i>

22:24.669 --> 22:26.736
<i>And so during lunch,
a rumor started,</i>

22:26.771 --> 22:29.138
<i>and by the next day,
everyone was waiting for me,</i>

22:29.173 --> 22:30.640
<i>to yell and cuss
and spit at me,</i>

22:30.675 --> 22:32.975
<i>calling me
"the retard fucker."</i>

22:34.712 --> 22:36.679
<i>I couldn't handle the ridicule,</i>

22:36.714 --> 22:38.714
<i>so I got high and drunk
and walked down</i>

22:38.750 --> 22:40.483
<i>to the train tracks
and laid down</i>

22:40.518 --> 22:42.752
<i>and put two big pieces of
cement on my chest and legs,</i>

22:42.787 --> 22:45.554
<i>and I waited
for the 11:00 train.</i>

22:46.824 --> 22:49.258
<i>The train came closer
and closer and closer,</i>

22:49.294 --> 22:51.777
<i>and it went on the
next track besides me</i>

22:51.813 --> 22:53.646
<i>instead of over me.</i>

22:55.650 --> 22:58.618
<i>The tension from school
had an effect on me.</i>

22:58.653 --> 23:01.320
<i>And the train scared me enough
to try to rehabilitate myself,</i>

23:01.372 --> 23:03.072
<i>and my...
My lifting weights</i>

23:03.124 --> 23:05.741
<i>and mathematics
seemed to be improving,</i>

23:05.743 --> 23:07.410
<i>so I became
less manically depressed</i>

23:07.462 --> 23:10.713
<i>but still never had
any friends because I...</i>

23:10.748 --> 23:14.300
<i>I hated everyone,
for they were so phony.</i>

23:37.025 --> 23:38.741
<i>When Kurt was about 15,</i>

23:38.776 --> 23:40.826
<i>he moved back in
with Mom and I,</i>

23:40.862 --> 23:42.278
<i>and it was a struggle.</i>

23:42.330 --> 23:44.864
<i>You know,
it was still him wanting to rebel</i>

23:44.916 --> 23:48.284
and getting stoned and going
out with his friends,

23:48.286 --> 23:50.836
and not wanting to,
you know, do chores,

23:50.872 --> 23:54.090
and, you know,
he was always wanting

23:54.125 --> 23:56.125
to, like,
just do his own thing.

23:56.147 --> 23:57.509
_

23:57.528 --> 23:59.762
<i>He wanted normalcy...
He wanted the mom, the dad,</i>

23:59.797 --> 24:01.564
<i>and the kids
and everything happy.</i>

24:01.599 --> 24:03.799
But then he didn't,

24:03.835 --> 24:06.335
'cause he kind of fought
against it.

24:06.371 --> 24:08.904
So he fought against
what he really wanted.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.856
<i>Hello?</i>

24:10.892 --> 24:12.725
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- You still there?</i>

24:12.777 --> 24:15.361
<i>- Yeah.

24:15.396 --> 24:16.562
<i>Okay.</i>

24:16.614 --> 24:18.064
<i>Are you recording this
or writing it down?</i>

24:18.116 --> 24:19.815
<i>Yeah,
I'm recording and writing.</i>

24:21.285 --> 24:22.485
<i>People don't realize</i>

24:22.487 --> 24:24.904
<i>where we really came from,
you know?</i>

24:24.956 --> 24:27.406
<i>What an isolated hellhole
it really is.</i>

24:27.458 --> 24:29.208
<i>You know, man,
if the witch burnings</i>

24:29.243 --> 24:31.711
<i>would've been, like, legal,
we'd all be dead now, you know?</i>

24:31.746 --> 24:33.412
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

24:33.464 --> 24:35.498
<i>Did you ever see that movie
"Over the Edge"?</i>

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<i>- I mean, God.</i>

24:37.502 --> 24:39.719
<i>That movie had
such an effect on me.</i>

24:39.754 --> 24:43.172
<i>Okay, you guys,
you're to take these home to your parents.</i>

24:43.224 --> 24:46.175
It's to let them know about
a special emergency meeting

24:46.177 --> 24:49.095
- to discuss the problems about you people.
<i>- I love that movie.</i>

24:49.147 --> 24:51.347
<i>- I always wanted to do that at Monte.</i>
<i>- Me, too.</i>

24:51.349 --> 24:52.932
<i>I tried, you know.</i>

24:52.984 --> 24:54.850
<i>I wanted to be a vandal</i>

24:54.902 --> 24:57.853
<i>and I wanted to hold everyone
captive in the school.</i>

24:57.855 --> 25:00.489
Everybody that's ever
messed with me in one room.

25:00.525 --> 25:02.408
That'd be just about
everybody in town.

25:02.443 --> 25:05.027
We should go down there and
tell them all to go to hell.

That I treated Kurt
maternally, took care of him,

33:41.428 --> 33:43.462

more I was trying to nurture him

33:43.514 --> 33:45.047
rather than take care of him.

33:45.099 --> 33:47.466
Tried to nurture who he was
and get him to...

33:47.518 --> 33:49.851
Let him do his art,
let him do his music

33:49.887 --> 33:51.436
and encourage him
to get better at it

33:51.472 --> 33:53.305
as opposed to trying
to stifle it.

33:53.357 --> 33:55.807
But also not try to be the mom,

33:55.859 --> 33:58.443

34:06.537 --> 34:07.703

34:07.738 --> 34:09.538
And then finally
somebody told him,

34:09.572 --> 34:11.206
"Don't you get that she
likes you or something?"

34:11.241 --> 34:13.208

clueless about it, you know?

34:18.465 --> 34:20.716
<i>Hey!</i>

34:23.420 --> 34:27.172

34:30.728 --> 34:34.929
<i>But mostly we just had
a good time hanging out.</i>

34:36.766 --> 34:38.350
<i>I think he might
have been a bit angry</i>

34:38.402 --> 34:40.235
<i>at the way he was
treated at school</i>

34:40.270 --> 34:43.655

34:46.025 --> 34:49.161

hard for him to accept love,</i>

34:49.196 --> 34:52.614
<i>but the fact that maybe he
was afraid of getting hurt.</i>

34:54.784 --> 34:57.085
<i>He was living at this tiny
little house in Aberdeen.</i>

34:57.121 --> 34:59.338

45:56.946 --> 46:00.248
<i>We're at the point
of kicking each other's ass.</i>

46:00.283 --> 46:03.785
<i>I would imagine that the
constant party atmosphere on the road</i>

46:03.787 --> 46:05.920
<i>would create a great deal
of physical and mental stress.</i>

46:05.955 --> 46:07.872
<i>How do you deal with it?</i>

46:07.924 --> 46:09.674
<i>We've prepared for the
rock 'n' roll lifestyle.</i>

46:09.709 --> 46:11.125
<i>We can kick it, man.</i>

46:11.177 --> 46:12.593
<i>You know what?</i>

46:12.629 --> 46:14.462
<i>We should move in our stuff
before it starts raining.</i>

46:14.514 --> 46:15.847
Yeah.

46:17.434 --> 46:20.685
<i>100% humidity here
in Fort Worth, Texas.</i>

46:20.720 --> 46:22.520
<i>...um, just excessive
or frightening?</i>

46:22.555 --> 46:24.972
<i>- Go in the van.</i>
<i>- Hey, whoo!</i>

46:24.974 --> 46:28.393
<i>No, because we actually want
to become more successful</i>

46:28.445 --> 46:30.478
<i>so we can have
a comfortable life.</i>

46:30.530 --> 46:33.147
<i>Neato.</i>

46:35.702 --> 46:37.652
<i>- Okay, man, take it away, buddy.
- Don't worry about me.</i>

46:37.654 --> 46:40.621
<i>I know this is kind of a strange angle,
but it'll work.</i>

46:43.293 --> 46:44.659
Yes.

46:44.661 --> 46:48.162
That's a big camera, man.
That's not your...

46:48.164 --> 46:51.666
<i>How would you describe the
music you play and the things you do?</i>

46:51.718 --> 46:55.386
Well, the things we do
is just we play

46:55.422 --> 46:59.223
a very powerful,
high-energy type of rock 'n' roll.

46:59.259 --> 47:00.675
We move around onstage a lot

47:00.727 --> 47:06.481
and just scream with an abandon,
I guess.

47:06.516 --> 47:08.683
<i>What makes you

47:08.685 --> 47:11.018
What makes us
want to be Nirvana?

47:11.020 --> 47:15.156
We're Nirvana because we're not
Aerosmith or something

47:15.191 --> 47:18.693
or "The Vegetables" or...

47:20.163 --> 47:22.080
<i>What's the future of Nirvana?</i>

47:22.115 --> 47:25.199
The future of Nirvana?
I don't know.

47:25.251 --> 47:27.785
Hopefully try to write
some more good songs.

47:27.837 --> 47:29.754
That's all we care about
is writing good music.

47:29.789 --> 47:33.291
If we get popular or not,
it doesn't matter.

47:33.343 --> 47:35.843
The music's more important.

<i>Whoo!</i>

49:18.064 --> 49:22.283
<i>I remember the first
review Nirvana ever got</i>

49:22.318 --> 49:25.987
<i>was for "The Love Buzz/Big Cheese"
single we did.</i>

49:25.989 --> 49:28.990
And it was in this hip
magazine out of Michigan

49:29.042 --> 49:32.293
these scenesters were doing,
and they gave us a bad review,

49:32.328 --> 49:35.496
and they said it was like Lynyrd Skynyrd,
but without the flares.

49:35.548 --> 49:39.250
Kurt was really hurt with that,
and he was telling me that.

49:39.302 --> 49:42.003
He goes... And I'd said,
"Don't worry about it.

49:42.005 --> 49:44.639
They're just scenesters.
They're hipsters."

49:44.674 --> 49:47.341
Or, you know,
"Screw them" or whatever.

49:47.343 --> 49:49.010
But, you know,

49:49.012 --> 49:51.512
Kurt hated being humiliated.

49:51.564 --> 49:53.097
He hated it.

49:53.149 --> 49:54.599
He hated it.

49:54.651 --> 49:56.901
If he ever thought
he was humiliated,

49:56.936 --> 50:00.438
then you'd see
the rage come out.

50:00.490 --> 50:04.358
And so he was also
very careful and stubborn

50:04.360 --> 50:08.195
about how the way the art
and the work was presented,

50:08.248 --> 50:09.697
because he didn't want
to be humiliated.

50:09.749 --> 50:13.534
I can be humiliated or, like,
humiliate myself or whatever,

50:13.536 --> 50:16.704
but not Kurt, no.

50:27.050 --> 50:29.133
<i>He had really
violent dreams a lot.</i>

50:29.185 --> 50:30.885
People would be breaking
into his house,

50:30.887 --> 50:32.803
trying to kill him,
and he'd have to stab them.

50:32.855 --> 50:35.473
I mean once in a while,
it might be his family who was trying to kill him,

50:35.525 --> 50:37.141
but that was just really rare.

50:37.193 --> 50:40.861
Usually it was someone else coming
after him that he didn't know.

50:40.897 --> 50:43.814
I asked... I thought he should
try to talk to someone,

50:43.866 --> 50:47.568
but without much money,
that really wasn't going to happen.

50:51.991 --> 50:54.208
<i>Kurt would get
stomachaches a lot</i>

50:54.243 --> 50:56.627
<i>and say his stomach hurt.</i>

50:56.663 --> 50:59.413
<i>You know, he'd be feeling fine,
and then he'd get out of the car</i>

50:59.415 --> 51:01.816
<i>and just be like,
"I gotta throw up."</i>

51:01.851 --> 51:03.217
<i>I know he went to the doctor</i>

51:03.252 --> 51:06.253
<i>once or twice,
but it didn't really work.</i>

51:12.428 --> 51:14.929
<i>Most of the time,
it's sitting right in my stomach.</i>

51:14.981 --> 51:19.183
<i>Like where my stomach pain is.</i>

51:19.235 --> 51:20.768
<i>Every time I've had
an endoscope,</i>

51:20.820 --> 51:23.154
<i>they'd find a red irritation.</i>

51:27.860 --> 51:30.494
<i>I would sing
and cough up blood.</i>

51:30.530 --> 51:33.080
<i>It's like this is no way
to live a life.</i>

51:33.116 --> 51:37.201
<i>I love to play music,
but something's not right.</i>

51:37.253 --> 51:40.621
<i>So I decided
to medicate myself.</i>

51:46.827 --> 51:51.497
_

51:51.617 --> 51:57.104
_

51:57.224 --> 52:08.364
_

52:08.484 --> 52:10.117
<i>How much of that
pain would you say</i>

52:10.153 --> 52:12.820
<i>actually fuels what you're
writing and playing?</i>

52:12.822 --> 52:14.155
<i>See, that's a scary question,</i>

52:14.207 --> 52:18.793
<i>because I think it probably helps,
you know?</i>

52:18.828 --> 52:22.797
<i>But I would give up everything
to have good health.</i>

52:22.832 --> 52:25.583
<i>But then again,
I'm always afraid</i>

52:25.635 --> 52:28.719
<i>that if I lost
the stomach problem,</i>

52:28.755 --> 52:31.172
<i>I might not be as creative.</i>

52:34.010 --> 52:36.477
<i>There's a journal
entry where Kurt mentions</i>

52:36.512 --> 52:40.898
<i>doing heroin for the first time in
1987 when he was living with you.</i>

52:40.933 --> 52:42.349
See, he never told me that.

52:42.351 --> 52:43.851
He totally
had kept that from me,

52:43.853 --> 52:45.436
because I totally would have
talked him out of it.

52:45.488 --> 52:47.438
In fact, he used to make fun
of some of the people

52:47.490 --> 52:49.573
in Seattle that were using that

52:49.609 --> 52:51.275
and say it was really stupid.

52:51.327 --> 52:54.528
Because I've been told before that
he was doing it when we were dating,

52:54.530 --> 52:58.199
but I'm like,
"He didn't do it around me, ever."

52:58.201 --> 53:01.335
I never found anything, so...

53:02.754 --> 53:06.786
_

53:10.046 --> 53:12.046
<i>I can't really say
exactly why we broke up.</i>

53:12.048 --> 53:13.764
<i>I just know
that we were fighting more</i>

53:13.800 --> 53:17.518
<i>and he was staying away
from the house more.</i>

53:17.553 --> 53:19.520
I think he just pretty much

53:19.555 --> 53:21.138
didn't love me
as much as he used to

53:21.224 --> 53:23.474
or felt...
He just felt like maybe

53:23.526 --> 53:25.609
he was moving ahead
and I wasn't.

53:33.669 --> 53:35.836
Kurt Cobain's here.

53:35.872 --> 53:38.606
You know,
Kurt Cobain from Aberdeen?

53:40.176 --> 53:43.277
- What's going on, baby?
- Not a damn thing.

53:43.312 --> 53:45.880
You called up and said,
"I want to play some songs."

53:45.915 --> 53:48.449
- So I said, "Rockin' good news."
- This is the truth.

53:48.484 --> 53:50.885
"Bloody brilliant."

53:50.920 --> 53:53.821
Um, I just wrote most of
the lyrics this evening.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.222
In the car on the way up here?

53:55.258 --> 53:57.191
While I was driving
with one foot.

53:57.226 --> 53:58.659
Uh-huh.

53:58.694 --> 54:00.761
Um, yeah, that's what I did,

54:00.796 --> 54:03.597
and I just thought I would
just come here, say hi.

54:03.633 --> 54:04.682
Well, let her rip.

54:08.604 --> 54:10.571
<i>Okay,
is there any major label interest</i>

54:10.606 --> 54:11.822
<i>in you at the present?</i>

54:11.858 --> 54:13.357
<i>Can you say?</i>

54:13.409 --> 54:15.576
<i>Anybody not
affiliated with CBS.</i>

54:15.611 --> 54:17.361
<i>Would you consider changing?</i>

54:17.413 --> 54:18.913
<i>We're considering AMA</i>

54:18.948 --> 54:21.866
<i>because we want to get
as much as we can.</i>

54:23.536 --> 54:25.286
<i>But you're sort of
this interesting mix of...</i>

54:25.288 --> 54:27.705
<i>As you say,
you're one of the laziest people you know,</i>

54:27.757 --> 54:30.291
<i>but you're also ambitious
for a lazy person.</i>

54:30.343 --> 54:32.259
<i>You think so?</i>

54:35.298 --> 54:37.715
<i>How does it feel to
be surrounded by so many people</i>

54:37.767 --> 54:40.768
<i>that are telling you that you'll
soon be doing very well?</i>

54:40.803 --> 54:44.972
<i>I think it's embarrassing
to have so many expectations</i>

54:45.024 --> 54:47.808
<i>and a totally superficial label
to put on a band</i>

54:47.810 --> 54:50.528
<i>to state that
they're the next big thing,</i>

54:50.563 --> 54:52.897

all you have to do is...

01:06:05.537 --> 01:06:07.704
The music is
a personal experience.

01:06:07.739 --> 01:06:11.408
You put the music on and
whatever you get out of it...

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.159
You know, if it's good or bad.

01:06:13.161 --> 01:06:15.912
If it's bad, you don't like it,
you just walk away from it.

01:06:15.964 --> 01:06:19.416
You know?
And if it's good, it works for you...

01:06:19.468 --> 01:06:22.669

- <i>Any cure for it?</i>
<i>- He's talking from his experiences.</i>

01:10:13.235 --> 01:10:14.651
<i>He's talking

01:10:14.703 --> 01:10:16.286
<i>Well,
he's got lousy experience, sir.</i>

01:10:16.321 --> 01:10:18.738
<i>Well,
it's not his goal to make millions of dollars</i>

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.540
<i>when he made the stuff.
He's writing about his life.</i>

01:10:20.575 --> 01:10:23.460
<i>Well,
his life needs to see a therapist or a minister,</i>

01:10:23.495 --> 01:10:25.912
<i>and it doesn't need to be
on millions of CDs</i>

01:10:25.964 --> 01:10:27.997

01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:31.251

01:10:31.253 --> 01:10:33.419

01:10:41.681 --> 01:10:43.803
_

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:49.659
_

01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:57.069

01:10:57.895 --> 01:11:00.890
_

01:11:01.398 --> 01:11:08.938
_

01:11:09.058 --> 01:11:11.900
_

01:11:12.303 --> 01:11:17.007
_

01:11:22.604 --> 01:11:25.188
I guess each individual's
going to deal with it

01:11:25.223 --> 01:11:26.689
the way they're going
to deal with it.

01:11:26.725 --> 01:11:29.392
I get... You know,
it was kind of traumatic

01:11:29.444 --> 01:11:31.311
to be famous all of a sudden,

01:11:31.313 --> 01:11:33.813
especially coming
from this complete obscurity

01:11:33.815 --> 01:11:36.482
and just being the number
one band in the world.

01:11:36.484 --> 01:11:38.818
So I did things like
withdraw or drink.

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.737
You know, I'm lucky.

01:11:40.789 --> 01:11:43.790
I had beer and wine, you know?

01:11:43.825 --> 01:11:45.158
Kurt had heroin.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.047
<i>Given how volatile
and complicated</i>

01:11:51.082 --> 01:11:53.967
<i>things were for Kurt
around that time,</i>

01:11:54.002 --> 01:11:56.753
<i>why do you think he chose that moment to,
um,</i>

01:11:56.805 --> 01:11:58.671
<i>start his relationship
with Courtney?</i>

01:12:00.842 --> 01:12:03.226
I went...
I had this relationship

01:12:03.261 --> 01:12:04.928
with this person, this woman.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:09.849
And I just kind of wanted
to build this home for myself,

01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:14.604
because my home growing up
had fallen apart.

01:12:14.656 --> 01:12:15.855
So I wanted to build a home.

01:12:15.857 --> 01:12:19.275
And I think that Kurt
wanted to do that, too.

01:12:19.327 --> 01:12:21.194
He wanted to build a home,

01:12:21.246 --> 01:12:23.863
because his home
and his family fell apart.

01:12:23.915 --> 01:12:27.250
So when Courtney
came into his life,

01:12:27.285 --> 01:12:30.003
they had...
She was interesting,

01:12:30.038 --> 01:12:33.039
she was artistic, intellectual,

01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:35.592
and, you know,
she did drugs, too,

01:12:35.627 --> 01:12:37.877
but that was all
part of the package

01:12:37.879 --> 01:12:40.930
of building a home.

01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:46.052
Check, check, check,
check, check, check, check.

01:12:46.054 --> 01:12:48.054
Let's watch their sound check,
shall we?

01:12:48.106 --> 01:12:49.856
<i>Sure.</i>

01:12:49.891 --> 01:12:53.393
Maybe that will bug them
and they'll play really bad.

01:12:53.445 --> 01:12:55.728
<i>I don't have the answer.</i>

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.530
<i>So you're having a relationship</i>

01:12:57.565 --> 01:12:59.365
<i>with the guitar player?</i>

01:13:00.285 --> 01:13:02.035
<i>No?</i>

01:13:05.657 --> 01:13:07.707
I don't know what it was.

01:13:07.742 --> 01:13:09.542
Honestly.

01:13:09.577 --> 01:13:11.461
<i>It's over?</i>

01:13:11.496 --> 01:13:13.496
I think, yeah.

01:13:13.548 --> 01:13:15.748
<i>What happened?</i>

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:18.051
I don't care.

01:13:23.842 --> 01:13:26.092
Dude, we're making a movie.

01:13:26.144 --> 01:13:28.594
Wow, did you curl your hair?

01:13:28.647 --> 01:13:31.014
- You don't like it?
- It's nicer when it's straight

01:13:31.066 --> 01:13:33.266
because it doesn't make
your face look so round.

01:13:33.268 --> 01:13:36.152

<i>...is spokesman for a generation.</i>

01:18:11.095 --> 01:18:13.629
<i>For his generation,
he's the closest to having a John Lennon.</i>

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.724
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

01:18:24.776 --> 01:18:26.809
<i>I never wanted the fame.</i>

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.277
<i>You suck!</i>

01:19:35.046 --> 01:19:37.380
Seattle's own Nirvana
finds itself

01:19:37.432 --> 01:19:39.849
at the very top of
"Billboard's" pop albums chart

01:19:39.884 --> 01:19:41.600
with its album "Nevermind,"

01:19:41.636 --> 01:19:43.135
while guitarist Kurt Cobain

01:19:43.187 --> 01:19:44.804
just got engaged
to Courtney Love,

01:19:44.806 --> 01:19:48.140
<i>front woman of an L.A.
band called Hole.</i>

01:19:48.142 --> 01:19:51.644
<i>According to "Rolling Stone,"
Cobain fell ill with a stomach problem</i>

01:19:51.696 --> 01:19:53.312
<i>during their tour
of four continents</i>

01:19:53.364 --> 01:19:55.865
<i>and had to cancel a number
of dates in England.</i>

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.284
<i>There's been speculation
of summer tour plans,</i>

01:19:58.319 --> 01:20:01.454
<i>but so far, only the next
Reading Festival in August.</i>

01:20:01.489 --> 01:20:03.989
<i>Nirvana is now retreating
from doing interviews.</i>

01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:06.125
<i>Whether it's a reaction
to "too much, too soon,"</i>

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.577
<i>the band would rather
their music speak for itself</i>

01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:11.247
<i>than be knighted as spokesmen
for a generation.</i>

01:20:13.251 --> 01:20:15.084
<i>Right after you
guys got married,</i>

01:20:15.136 --> 01:20:16.719
<i>they were the biggest band
in the world,</i>

01:20:16.754 --> 01:20:18.754
<i>and Kurt decided
to take six months off.</i>

01:20:18.806 --> 01:20:23.509
So, officially,
in the story that's out in the world,

01:20:23.511 --> 01:20:27.179
he took six months off
of their touring schedule?

01:20:27.231 --> 01:20:29.849
<i>He could have toured the world at that
point and made a shitload of money.</i>

01:20:29.901 --> 01:20:30.983
Oh, I see.

01:20:31.018 --> 01:20:32.184
<i>To me,
it seemed like he wanted to stay</i>

01:20:32.186 --> 01:20:34.270
<i>in an apartment with you
and do heroin.</i>

01:20:34.355 --> 01:20:37.356
Yeah, he wanted to stay in an
apartment and do heroin and paint.

01:20:37.408 --> 01:20:40.526
And play his guitar.
That's what he wanted to do.

01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:55.124
Hi.

01:21:00.264 --> 01:21:01.931
Hi.

01:21:14.946 --> 01:21:17.646
<i>- This is our house.
- This is where we live.</i>

01:21:17.698 --> 01:21:19.398
<i>I know it looks disgusting now,</i>

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.984
<i>but sometimes it's nice,
I mean after when I clean it,</i>

01:21:22.036 --> 01:21:23.319
<i>'cause no one else
fucking does.</i>

01:21:23.371 --> 01:21:26.405
<i>Okay, this is the toilet.</i>

01:21:26.407 --> 01:21:28.991
This is, um...

01:21:29.043 --> 01:21:30.709
- This is me.
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:21:30.745 --> 01:21:33.412
- Hello.
<i>- Do we have a turkey baster?</i>

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:36.415
<i>What?</i>

01:21:36.467 --> 01:21:38.584
<i>Right. Why do you think
that everyone thinks</i>

01:21:38.636 --> 01:21:40.753
<i>you're the good one
and I'm the bad one?</i>

01:21:40.805 --> 01:21:43.756
Because I know how
to "use my illusion."

01:21:45.676 --> 01:21:46.926
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:21:46.928 --> 01:21:50.646
I'm going into <i>my</i> other room.

01:21:50.764 --> 01:21:52.932
I paid for this.

01:21:52.934 --> 01:21:54.767
<i>Put on the "dancing
merry chimp"!</i>

01:21:58.606 --> 01:22:00.856
<i>So is this the living room
that that guy described</i>

01:22:00.908 --> 01:22:02.608
<i>in "Rolling Stone" magazine?</i>

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.277
With nothing
but a Twin Reverb amp

01:22:05.279 --> 01:22:07.413
- and teddy bears to keep him company.
<i>- And the Cosmic Psychos.</i>

01:22:07.448 --> 01:22:09.198
The "Cosmo Psychos."

01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:11.116
<i>- There's Eric.</i>
<i>- The champ.</i>

01:22:13.204 --> 01:22:15.788
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:19.625
- Hi.
<i>- I love you a lot. You are so cute.</i>

01:22:19.677 --> 01:22:22.628
- Here, Eric, you fill in for a while.
<i>- Here.</i>

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:25.764
This is the Kurt Cobain
action figure.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.801
<i>Secret coded message in his guitar.</i>

01:22:28.853 --> 01:22:31.804
Kurt, I think he looks
remarkably a lot like you.

01:22:31.806 --> 01:22:34.139
- Look at that.
- That's a bachata.

01:22:34.141 --> 01:22:35.774
And he's playing a...
What looks to be

01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:39.061
a sort of Mosrite-y
vintage...

01:22:39.113 --> 01:22:43.365
Come into the breakfast nook.

01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:12.311

01:24:39.517 --> 01:24:40.899
Oh, God, yes.

01:24:40.935 --> 01:24:42.434
Yes, we wanted to have a baby,

01:24:42.436 --> 01:24:45.270
and I conceived Frances
in December.

01:24:45.323 --> 01:24:47.272
So, I was pregnant
when I got married, yes.

01:24:47.274 --> 01:24:49.074
We were all we had,

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:51.827
so making a family
as fast as possible

01:24:51.862 --> 01:24:54.279
was, you know, important.

01:24:54.332 --> 01:24:57.833
You know, so, I mean,
if I had had more time,

01:24:57.868 --> 01:25:01.036
I'm telling you I'd have had
more kids with him.

01:25:01.088 --> 01:25:04.623
<i>Why do you feel so bad?</i>

01:25:06.677 --> 01:25:09.511
- Why?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:25:09.547 --> 01:25:12.131
Because I want to.

01:25:12.133 --> 01:25:14.133
It's my fault.

01:25:14.185 --> 01:25:17.469
All my fault.

01:25:17.521 --> 01:25:19.521
<i>- You're beautiful.
- I think you're really cute.</i>

01:25:19.557 --> 01:25:20.973
Thank you very much.

01:25:21.025 --> 01:25:24.026
<i>So do a lot of "Sassy" readers.</i>

01:25:24.061 --> 01:25:25.778
<i>I married Bobby Sherman.</i>

01:25:25.813 --> 01:25:28.781
<i>- Do you think they do this to me?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

01:25:28.816 --> 01:25:31.700
Do you think they do this to me
when they read "Sassy"?

01:25:34.455 --> 01:25:37.406
<i>Girls don't masturbate
over their teen idols.</i>

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:38.824
They don't?

01:25:38.876 --> 01:25:41.794
<i>No, they make up much more
intricate schematic plans.</i>

01:25:41.829 --> 01:25:44.246
<i>Girls are a lot more
complex than boys.</i>

01:25:44.298 --> 01:25:45.748
<i>You don't know what girls
do to each other.</i>

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.883
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>
<i>- No, you don't.</i>

01:25:47.918 --> 01:25:51.754
- They're vicious.
- I mean, you can know about crafty girls all you want,

01:25:51.806 --> 01:25:54.006
but I wouldn't
let you go on tour

01:25:54.008 --> 01:25:56.175
with crafty girls
because fuckin'...

01:25:56.177 --> 01:25:57.760
It doesn't fuckin' matter, man.

01:25:57.812 --> 01:25:59.645
They... They...

01:26:02.183 --> 01:26:03.649
They diss me.

01:26:03.684 --> 01:26:06.185
They diss me all the time.

01:26:06.237 --> 01:26:07.686
I'd be fat.

01:26:07.688 --> 01:26:10.155
I can't... I know it's not
even like I can't trust you,

01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:12.024
it's just you can't
trust men in general,

01:26:12.026 --> 01:26:15.444
even if they're new men
and they're you.

01:26:15.496 --> 01:26:20.449
And even if they're like you,
you still can't trust them.

01:26:20.501 --> 01:26:23.285
I understand what you're trying to say,
but I don't agree.

01:26:23.337 --> 01:26:27.122
- Just because you...
- I'm a new man. I'm a man for the '90s.

01:26:27.174 --> 01:26:29.174
I'm Ward Cleaver.

01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:31.210
And then, you being you,
you'd be all sensitive

01:26:31.212 --> 01:26:32.961
and you'd go...

01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:34.513
"How are we gonna
tell Courtney?"

01:26:35.966 --> 01:26:37.599
Meanwhile, I've ruined my career,
I've ruined my life,

01:26:37.635 --> 01:26:40.052
become the most hated woman in America,
because I'm 200 pounds.

01:26:40.104 --> 01:26:42.805
- But you're already the most hated woman in America.
- What?

01:26:42.857 --> 01:26:46.391
You and Roseanne Barr are tied for
being the most hated woman in America.

01:26:46.393 --> 01:26:48.277
Okay, I married Bobby Sherman,
I'm the most hated...

01:26:48.312 --> 01:26:52.314
Ruined my body,
not play the Reading Festival this year

01:26:52.366 --> 01:26:54.983
when I could have
kicked your ass.

01:26:55.035 --> 01:26:56.902
- Just...
- You could... You should still play the Reading...

01:26:56.954 --> 01:26:59.988
Oh, yes, I should just
play the Reading Festival.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.124
- Dive into the crowd...
- Right. That's right.

01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:04.409
Shoot off a gun,
light yourself on fire.

01:27:04.462 --> 01:27:08.497
- Let everyone see this.
- And give birth.

01:27:08.549 --> 01:27:11.416
And this is only half of it.

01:27:11.469 --> 01:27:15.087
- The rest is yet to come.
- Look. Moustache.

01:27:15.089 --> 01:27:16.889
- Hmm, I like that.
<i>- Wait, wait.</i>

01:27:16.924 --> 01:27:20.642
Free moustache rides!

01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:23.979
It's a "womb broom."

01:27:24.014 --> 01:27:26.982
- Keep it, please?
- Okay! Ha!

01:27:27.017 --> 01:27:29.434
- Just keep it for the night.
- No way!

01:27:29.436 --> 01:27:31.236

nothing more than a joke.</i>

01:56:34.730 --> 01:56:36.980
<i>- And what kind of...
- Who were you playing the joke on?</i>

01:56:37.016 --> 01:56:39.399
<i>'Cause I have to admit,
my first reaction was,</i>

01:56:39.435 --> 01:56:42.603
<i>you know,
either this is really intensely satirical</i>

01:56:42.655 --> 01:56:46.156
<i>or there's some really
dark shit happening here.</i>

01:57:11.967 --> 01:57:14.968
<i>I'm really thankful
for a lot of things...</i>

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:18.055
<i>My family, my child.</i>

01:57:18.057 --> 01:57:20.524
<i>And every month,</i>

01:57:20.559 --> 01:57:24.528
<i>I come to more optimistic
conclusions.</i>

01:57:24.563 --> 01:57:27.731
<i>Do you find that you're
getting happier in general?</i>

01:57:27.783 --> 01:57:31.285
<i>- Yeah.
- I hope I don't become so blissful</i>

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:33.370
- <i>that I lose...</i>
<i>- Become boring.</i>

01:57:33.405 --> 01:57:36.740
<i>Yeah,
I become boring or I lose my edge</i>

01:57:36.792 --> 01:57:38.959
<i>or whatever it is, you know.</i>

01:57:38.994 --> 01:57:40.327
<i>And who knows?</i>

01:57:40.379 --> 01:57:42.462
<i>I don't have
any new songs right now,</i>

01:57:42.498 --> 01:57:45.582
<i>so I'm starting from scratch
for the first time.</i>

01:57:45.634 --> 01:57:48.719
<i>- Tabula rasa, that'll be interesting.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:57:48.754 --> 01:57:50.754
<i>Is there a little
fear of the unknown?</i>

01:57:50.756 --> 01:57:53.256
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

01:57:53.309 --> 01:57:56.310
<i>Check, check, check.</i>

01:57:56.345 --> 01:57:57.761
Check, check, check.

01:57:57.813 --> 01:58:00.063
<i>Turn both guitars down.</i>

01:58:00.099 --> 01:58:03.183
<i>- Turn both guitars down now.
- They're too loud.</i>

01:58:04.403 --> 01:58:07.938
<i>Scott,
you know that goofy-ass stuff</i>

01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:10.240
that they have at music
stores called "Finger-ease"?

01:58:10.275 --> 01:58:11.942
<i>- That's a lot better.
- Thanks.</i>

01:58:11.944 --> 01:58:13.827
<i>It's like an anal gel.</i>

01:58:13.862 --> 01:58:15.946
<i>If I could just put some
on this string...</i>

01:58:15.948 --> 01:58:17.164
<i>"Finger-ease"?</i>

01:58:17.199 --> 01:58:18.832
It's called
"Finger-ease"

01:58:18.867 --> 01:58:20.417
that your...
Yeah, it's like a roll-on.

01:58:20.452 --> 01:58:22.452
<i>I just need it on one string.</i>

01:58:22.504 --> 01:58:25.288
<i>God, I'm being picky today.</i>

01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:28.458
Baby.

01:58:29.928 --> 01:58:33.213
Will you guys, like...
Will you and Janet

01:58:33.265 --> 01:58:35.349
and everybody that I know
sit in the front

01:58:35.384 --> 01:58:37.300
so I can look at you?

01:58:37.353 --> 01:58:39.553
'Cause I hate strangers.

01:58:40.472 --> 01:58:42.639
<i>One, two, three.</i>

01:58:49.398 --> 01:58:51.031
Thank you.

01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:56.119

sing, "Kumbaya"?

01:59:11.253 --> 01:59:12.803
<i>No,
I don't remember the little bird.</i>

01:59:12.838 --> 01:59:14.921
Remember that
really evil episode

01:59:14.973 --> 01:59:16.556
where he was really mad
at this kid,

01:59:16.592 --> 01:59:19.309
and he had all these visions
of how he's going to...

01:59:19.344 --> 01:59:21.094
First I'm going to take him up to a hill

01:59:21.146 --> 01:59:24.898
and tie him to a tree
and tar and feather him!

01:59:24.933 --> 01:59:27.517
It was evil.
That wasn't Christian at all.

02:02:26.415 --> 02:02:30.867
You don't tell stories the way he does,
but, I mean...

02:02:30.919 --> 02:02:32.202
You mean like this?

02:02:42.264 --> 02:02:43.763
Seen it, done it.

02:02:47.352 --> 02:02:50.053
I feel kind of happy right now.

02:02:50.055 --> 02:02:51.938
<i>Yeah, I do, too.</i>

02:02:54.726 --> 02:02:57.560
<i>We're all sensitive
to ridicule and shame,</i>

02:02:57.613 --> 02:03:01.982
<i>but it seemed to me,
having gone through his materials,</i>

02:03:02.034 --> 02:03:05.151
<i>that he was hypersensitive...</i>

02:03:05.203 --> 02:03:07.120
<i>Felt criticism, felt praise,</i>

02:03:07.155 --> 02:03:09.906
<i>felt things
a little more intensely.</i>

02:03:09.908 --> 02:03:11.074
Probably.

02:03:11.126 --> 02:03:13.126
You know, he was so sensitive

02:03:13.161 --> 02:03:17.414
that the one time that I
thought about cheating on him,

02:03:17.416 --> 02:03:20.917
he fuckin' must have been
psychic or something.

02:03:20.969 --> 02:03:22.085
I thought about it.

02:03:22.137 --> 02:03:24.254
I didn't do it,
but I thought about it.

02:03:24.306 --> 02:03:25.972
<i>You never cheated on Kurt?</i>

02:03:26.008 --> 02:03:28.591
No, but I almost did one time,
and he knew it,

02:03:28.593 --> 02:03:30.477
and I don't know
how he knew it.

02:03:30.512 --> 02:03:32.178
I have no idea how he knew it.

02:03:32.230 --> 02:03:36.766
I mean, I didn't...
Because the plan didn't ever go anywhere.

02:03:36.818 --> 02:03:39.436
So, it was just...
Nothing happened,

02:03:39.438 --> 02:03:44.240
but I was tired and I...

02:03:44.276 --> 02:03:49.446
I'm not...
I wasn't as monogamous as he is...

02:03:49.498 --> 02:03:52.999
I'm a big flirt,
so I flirt with chairs.

02:03:53.035 --> 02:03:55.752
But I never,
never cheated on him,

02:03:55.787 --> 02:03:58.621
but I certainly thought about
it one time in London.

02:03:58.623 --> 02:04:00.707
And I could have done it.

02:04:00.759 --> 02:04:05.628
And the response to it was...

02:04:05.681 --> 02:04:08.765
he took 67 Rohypnols
and ended up in a coma

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:11.051
because I thought about
cheating on him.

02:04:11.103 --> 02:04:13.436
I mean, fuck.
You're kidding.

02:04:14.639 --> 02:04:17.807
I didn't even make
the phone call to do it.

02:04:17.809 --> 02:04:20.026
<i>So why do you think
he chose that night</i>

02:04:20.062 --> 02:04:21.528
<i>to try to take his life?</i>

02:04:21.563 --> 02:04:24.481
<i>Was it because
he felt rejected?</i>

02:04:24.533 --> 02:04:28.735
I think he would see it more as, like,
severe betrayal than rejection.

02:04:28.787 --> 02:04:31.204
You know what I mean?
