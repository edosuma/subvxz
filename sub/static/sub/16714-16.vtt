WEBVTT

00:07.290 --> 00:08.826
Previously on Criminal Minds...

00:09.120 --> 00:11.281
They just charged Reid
with the murder of Nadie Ramos.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.246
Bail is denied. Defendant will be remanded

00:13.250 --> 00:14.490
to federal custody pending trial.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.279
He's in prison?

00:17.710 --> 00:18.995
You're going to give
yourself a concussion.

00:19.460 --> 00:20.916
Beats what they'll do to me inside.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.030
Ahhh! Help!

00:24.580 --> 00:26.571
You, you need to show some respect.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.285
Back off.

00:28.960 --> 00:29.995
Now.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.456
All right, inmates, go, out of your racks.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.956
Out!

01:05.880 --> 01:07.029
What happened?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.160
Welcoming committee.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.165
You okay?

01:11.830 --> 01:13.115
I am right now.

01:14.210 --> 01:16.201
It's later I'm worried about.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.700
Anything I can do to help?

01:19.620 --> 01:23.112
Yeah. Give me some of that
"Don't touch the skinny white guy"

01:23.120 --> 01:24.826
pixie dust you got sprinkled on you.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.785
This ain't social hour.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.035
Get back to work.

01:50.580 --> 01:51.877
ﬁg?“ "1?;

01:51.880 --> 01:52.869
No touching.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.114
Is everything okay

01:57.120 --> 01:59.953
No. No, she's fine.
She's fine. I saw her yesterday.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.369
She asked about you.

02:01.670 --> 02:02.955
Cassie said she was
having a really good day.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.075
Where did you, uh, tell her I was?

02:06.170 --> 02:08.035
Uh, the beach.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.241
Well, she asked if that's where you were.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.740
It seemed to make her happy, so...

02:14.330 --> 02:15.536
Good. Okay.

02:19.460 --> 02:20.449
How are you doing?

02:23.960 --> 02:25.075
I'm okay.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.207
I, uh, I'm really happy to see you.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.660
Ijust...

02:28.670 --> 02:30.911
I kind of wish you hadn't come.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.989
It's not a good idea.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.615
Sorry. You're stuck with me.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.956
Garcia has us on shifts,

02:35.960 --> 02:38.076
and she of course took first dibs,

02:38.080 --> 02:40.207
but, uh, they needed her
in the office for a case,

02:40.460 --> 02:42.075
so I was the luclq one.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.877
A case? J], you should not be here.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.108
The last time I saw you,

02:45.670 --> 02:48.036
I promised you would not be alone.

02:50.620 --> 02:53.168
I am just trying to keep up
the best way I can.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.409
What's the case?

02:57.830 --> 02:58.910
What?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.490
The case. I'm assuming you stayed behind

03:00.750 --> 03:01.785
unless it's local. Is it local?

03:02.290 --> 03:03.780
No. New York.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.996
But... You really want to hear this?

03:07.420 --> 03:12.039
Yeah. I'd love something to think about
besides, you know, this.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.956
Okay.

03:16.710 --> 03:17.870
Um...

03:18.500 --> 03:21.037
Last night they found the latest victim,

03:21.790 --> 03:23.872
which is the third in the last six weeks.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.495
He dumps them in alleys.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.911
All female, in their 205.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.912
Equal opportunity. He crosses race lines.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.115
Oh, and the media's having a field day.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.952
They're calling him the Bone Crusher.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.373
Gigi Stevens,
26-year-old waitress from Brooklyn.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.109
Cause of death was loss of blood

03:44.120 --> 03:45.576
from all the compound fractures.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.241
This one tore her femoral artery.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.820
That was probably what did it.

03:48.830 --> 03:51.321
But I did find a few
postmortem fractures as well.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.570
What about a tox screen?

03:52.580 --> 03:54.787
We found traces of alcohol and MDMA
in her system.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.877
It's exactly like the first two victims.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.449
Any sign of sexual assault?

03:58.830 --> 04:00.411
-None.
-Breaking bones

04:00.420 --> 04:01.489
is what gets him off.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.821
No, no more.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.166
Wait, you think she's
only been dead 24 hours?

04:22.170 --> 04:23.239
Yeah, maximum.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.280
Well, she went missing a week ago.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.201
That meant he held her for several days.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.786
He didn't do that with his other victims.

04:30.790 --> 04:32.872
He abducted, killed, and dumped them all

04:32.880 --> 04:34.279
within a two-day period.

04:34.290 --> 04:35.951
Holding her means a lot more work for him.

04:36.330 --> 04:37.706
Oh, he was busy, all right.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.450
He broke all her fingers and toes first.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.871
But the big breaks he saved for last.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.787
So, he's a sadist
who's learned how to prolong

04:55.790 --> 04:57.701
his pleasure by keeping her alive.

04:57.710 --> 05:00.372
But the torture must mean something
if he's willing to risk holding her.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.455
- -Ahhh!

05:18.790 --> 05:22.032
All of these women were educated
and gainfully employed.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.871
Totally low-risk lifestyles.

05:24.710 --> 05:27.417
Yeah, but they were all found
at bars and night clubs,

05:27.420 --> 05:29.957
and they each had
alcohol and drugs in their system,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.246
so they weren't exactly
shrinking violets either.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.745
But drugs and the alcohol

05:34.750 --> 05:36.286
are probably part of his ruse.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.741
That means he has social skills.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.110
I bet he charms them in, like Bundy.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.451
I just keep wondering why a sadist

05:43.830 --> 05:46.207
would use a love drug
that makes you feel empathy.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.990
Well, we don't know for sure
that he uses it, too.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.410
He may want to maintain focus.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.496
Well, if he's holding them captive now,
he needs space to do that.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.076
Not impossible, but that's not exactly

05:56.080 --> 05:57.786
the easiest thing to find
in New York City.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.668
He could even be using
a small van or truck.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.995
Excuse me, agents,

06:03.000 --> 06:04.456
there's a woman out here
I think you should talk to.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.992
Apparently she came in this morning,
said she had information for the FBI.

06:08.330 --> 06:10.537
So my guys took her name, number.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.700
She insisted on waiting.

06:13.330 --> 06:15.286
So when I finally sat down with her,
she showed me this.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.956
She said her son wrote all that.

06:28.290 --> 06:29.871
She claims he's the Bone Crusher.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.919
"To go against conscience
is neither right nor safe.

07:19.330 --> 07:22.743
"Here I stand. I can do no other."

07:23.210 --> 07:24.416
Martin Luther.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.956
I'd love to get
a piece of that, huh?

07:27.330 --> 07:28.911
It's okay.
-GUARD: Hey, quiet in there!

07:29.170 --> 07:30.376
Hmm?

07:31.290 --> 07:33.030
It's not my first time in a prison.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.700
I can handle it.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.912
Sorry. I don't want them looking at you.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.531
I know. I don't either.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.707
But if that's the price
I have to pay to see you,

07:44.250 --> 07:45.877
I'm okay with that.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.820
So, listen, um, there are
some other things

07:48.830 --> 07:49.876
we should talk about.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.877
We got your full panel tox screen results.

07:53.830 --> 07:56.492
Um, they were negative for scopolamine.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.109
How are we gonna prove
that scratch is behind all this?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.280
We'll find another way.

08:03.420 --> 08:04.705
Look, it was too late by the time

08:04.710 --> 08:05.950
we took that blood test.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.451
You must have metabolized everything.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.700
-He's gonna get away with it.
-Spence.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.410
He's gonna get away with it.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.819
We're not gonna let him.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.030
We're gonna get you out of here.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.075
I promise.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.825
And we are gonna get that

08:23.120 --> 08:25.247
psychopath and we are
gonna clear your name.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.168
Just, please, keep your head down,

08:29.920 --> 08:30.989
and focus on that.

08:32.750 --> 08:33.819
Okay?

08:34.380 --> 08:35.369
Okay.

08:35.710 --> 08:36.870
You'll have to

08:36.880 --> 08:39.496
forgive me, Ms. White.
I mean no disrespect.

08:40.210 --> 08:42.246
But we have very limited resources.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.572
Look, I know you must
get a lot of crazies,

08:45.580 --> 08:47.992
but I swear to God, I'm not one of them.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.242
You saw what he wrote,
about the girls he sees

08:51.250 --> 08:53.206
on the subway and on the train.

08:53.210 --> 08:56.111
How he followed them,
what he wants to do to them.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.326
And there's more.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.070
I couldn't bring it all.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.207
Plus, you should see how it is.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.571
Please, come look for yourself.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.199
Please.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.070
You said you lived in Kingsbridge?

09:15.330 --> 09:17.036
That's not too far from where I grew up.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.780
I could come check it out.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.701
I'll go with.

09:23.710 --> 09:26.782
He lived down here,
but I finally had to kick him out.

09:26.790 --> 09:28.030
Why?

09:28.040 --> 09:31.669
Because he came home one night
with blood on him, but he wasn't hurt.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.570
And he wouldn't tell me how it got there.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.241
How long ago was that?

09:35.250 --> 09:36.660
About six weeks.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.115
When he didn't come back,
I decided I'd clean out

09:39.120 --> 09:40.610
some of his stuff, you know?

09:40.960 --> 09:43.246
And, uh, that's when I found...

09:51.830 --> 09:53.821
Have you moved or touched
any of this stuff?

09:53.830 --> 09:56.663
No. I left it exactly as it is.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.377
I'll call Prentiss.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.490
What's that?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.782
It's a present from Henry.

10:12.620 --> 10:15.532
So that is you, and that is him.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.377
It's from that day we went to the park.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.996
Tell him it's beautiful.
Tell him I love it.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.456
Visiting hours are over.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.747
Inmates, line up.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.615
Hey. You stay strong.

10:32.960 --> 10:33.949
Let's go.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.998
"Her legs were perfect, like a dancer's.

11:08.620 --> 11:12.784
"Sinew and tight muscle.
I'd love to hear her bones snap

11:12.790 --> 11:14.371
"as they rip through her flesh."

11:14.960 --> 11:16.746
But this is more than just sadism.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.661
This bone-breaking is some kind of

11:19.380 --> 11:20.608
psychopathic compulsion.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.168
Can you imagine if it was
your kid living down here?

11:31.790 --> 11:33.997
Sometimes he disappears
for days at a time.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.536
I don't know where he goes.

11:37.670 --> 11:39.740
This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.739
Oh, no, this isn't your fault.

11:41.290 --> 11:42.871
Yes, I should have gone
to the police sooner.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.917
You can't blame yourself, for any of this.

11:47.170 --> 11:49.707
You did the right thing
by coming to us when you did.

11:50.420 --> 11:54.072
Listen, I know this is difficult. Okay?

11:55.380 --> 11:59.111
We need you to focus right now, okay,
because we all want the same thing here.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.450
To find Danny.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.781
-Okay.
-And so let's just start at the beginning.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.457
Why don't you tell us,
what was Danny like growing up?

12:08.380 --> 12:09.870
He was a sweet kid.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.325
Normal, you know?

12:14.540 --> 12:15.916
Until his dad left.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.989
Can you tell us about that?

12:20.380 --> 12:21.950
He ran off with our next-door neighbor.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.165
He's not seen him since.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.417
And how old was Danny when his dad left?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.609
Eleven.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.614
He's never been the same.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.409
How so?

12:35.420 --> 12:36.614
He's just so angry.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.701
Always getting in trouble at school.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.280
When was the first time

12:41.290 --> 12:43.747
you knew something was wrong with him?

12:44.250 --> 12:46.320
I mean, really knew.

12:49.670 --> 12:52.070
I guess about 10 years ago when he was 13.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.411
Why are we talking about this?

12:54.420 --> 12:56.661
Like, how is this gonna help find Danny?

12:56.670 --> 12:59.286
Mrs. White, we're not...
We're not regular policemen.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.202
We don't just look
at fingerprints and evidence.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.746
We look at behavior.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.577
So even the smallest detail of something
might be a really big help.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.917
I wanted to paint
our old apartment after...

13:12.710 --> 13:13.779
After his father left.

13:14.330 --> 13:15.706
We couldn't afford to move.

13:16.790 --> 13:18.667
And I was painting Danny's room...

13:40.920 --> 13:42.956
I fell off the ladder and broke my arm.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.702
Danny was there,
but I didn't see him come in.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.954
Then when I asked him to help me,
he just stood there, laughing.

14:12.380 --> 14:16.111
Is it possible that Danny
may have pushed you off that ladder?

14:19.420 --> 14:20.739
Oh...

14:26.000 --> 14:28.286
By any chance, do you remember
the address of that building?

14:29.960 --> 14:31.109
What do you want, newbie?

14:32.460 --> 14:35.202
Still with that? Come on.
You need some new material.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.161
Okay, whatever you say,

14:37.960 --> 14:38.949
E| Nuo.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.609
Hunlq newster.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.611
New Kid on the...
No, that one's too much on the nose.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.707
All right, whatever.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.911
I need you to check out an address for me.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.035
Sure. Shoot.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.077
11637 Woodycrest Avenue.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.707
It's an apartment building in the Bronx.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.457
Any criminal activity that
might relate to Danny White.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.996
Hold yourself. Searching now.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.781
Just your garden variety vandalism,
drug possession.

15:01.790 --> 15:04.372
It's all pretty standard
for a condemned building.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.536
Mmm-hmm.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.949
Has been for months.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.575
It's scheduled to be demolished,

15:10.920 --> 15:12.740
but, uh, something's holding it up.
Permit issue.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.322
Thanks, Garcia.
You truly, you are the best.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.166
Really?

15:18.170 --> 15:19.376
Available.

15:23.170 --> 15:24.159
Newbie.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.378
So, the apartment building
Danny White used to live in is abandoned.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.030
Do you have a hunch about something?

15:34.040 --> 15:35.826
Danny grew up in the neighborhood

15:36.120 --> 15:37.701
and up until recently lived here
with his mom.

15:37.710 --> 15:39.996
So I'm thinking he wants
to be at someplace familiar.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.242
And we did profile
he'd need a space to do his thing.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.740
An abandoned building would do the trick.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.916
All right, you two go ahead.
Keep me posted.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.745
She said it was 6C.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.035
-You hear that?
-Yeah.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.161
Got some bolt cutters in the car.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.321
It's okay. It's okay.
Is there anyone else here?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.285
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:41.210 --> 16:44.031
And that is you, and that is him.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.075
It's from that day we went to the park.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.069
Hey, you.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.371
What's up, my man?

17:02.710 --> 17:03.950
How you doin'

17:04.330 --> 17:05.786
Don't play that.

17:05.790 --> 17:06.996
Hey, where you goin'?

17:07.330 --> 17:08.490
They're gonna kill him.

17:08.830 --> 17:10.411
Sit down. Sit down!

17:11.790 --> 17:12.779
No, they won't.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.116
Teach him a lesson, maybe,
but they won't kill him. Be too easy.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.246
How do you know?

17:17.250 --> 17:18.660
'Cause I know how they think.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.245
They're testing him.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.070
Want to see if he's
going to float or drown.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.378
The rules in here are different.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.377
You don't have a badge or a gun.

17:27.420 --> 17:28.910
Stop fighting it, man.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.167
Okay, we got an ID on the victim.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.702
Name's Serena Adams,
25-year-old grad student at NYU.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.490
Exactly his type.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.615
How long has she been missing?

17:49.620 --> 17:50.780
Since yesterday.

17:50.790 --> 17:51.996
He's moving fast.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.662
Looks like he was living here
after his mom kicked him out.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.319
He's even got food and water back there.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.456
This guy is somewhere in the city
and we're gonna ﬁnd him.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.168
Daniel Allen White
was a demolition contractor.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.747
Which was obviously his way
of sublimating his desires.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.325
with condemned and abandoned buildings.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.116
Uh, we can double up
on patrols in those areas.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.326
Especially your unmarked units.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.451
We want to catch this guy,
not just deter him.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.372
This geographic profile
covers the entire city.

18:19.380 --> 18:22.611
He's used all five boroughs
to either abduct or dump his victims.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.571
He grew up in this apartment
and it took a concerted effort

18:25.580 --> 18:28.071
for him to come back here
and use it like this.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.911
So, location is important to him.

18:30.420 --> 18:31.910
If he sticks to his pattern,
she'll be in her 205.

18:32.620 --> 18:35.703
He blends in, he appears nonthreatening,
and he's attractive,

18:36.460 --> 18:39.327
all traits that immediately
lower most people's defenses.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.161
Because of his job,
he's also physically strong.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.951
So not only does he have
the tools to manipulate his victims,

18:44.960 --> 18:47.531
he has the strength
to overpower them as well.

18:47.540 --> 18:51.203
We also think he uses MDMA
as part of his ruse.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.872
As you know, MDMA is a popular drug,

18:53.880 --> 18:56.201
lowers inhibitions,
makes for easier targets.

18:56.210 --> 18:58.531
Daniel Allen White will strike again,

18:58.540 --> 19:00.167
probably sooner rather than later.

19:00.170 --> 19:01.660
We need to find him before he does.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.029
Thank you.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.569
How's it going with the case?

19:06.580 --> 19:08.741
Everything okay with the girl they found?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.377
Yeah, I don't know.
She's still in surgery.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.870
Oh, how's boy wonder?

19:13.580 --> 19:14.569
He's good.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.740
What? No, he must be terrible.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.200
What do you mean? Tell me everything.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.450
No, don't tell me everything.
I don't want to know.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.075
No, of course I want to know.
Tell me everything. Tell me everything.

19:23.880 --> 19:24.995
He can't stay in there.

19:27.920 --> 19:28.989
We gotta get him out.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.074
Yeah. We will. We will.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.707
Come here. We'll get him out.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.661
His face is all over the news.

19:43.670 --> 19:44.785
Every cop in town is looking for him.

19:44.790 --> 19:46.417
How has no one seen this guy?

19:46.420 --> 19:48.661
We just gotta keep the pressure on
and hopefully he'll make a mistake.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.032
Serena Adams is still
recovering from surgery,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.031
but she had MDMA in her system

19:55.040 --> 19:56.996
and was last_ seen
at a night club With friends.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.240
We should talk to them.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.820
And we should also
talk to Miranda White again.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.377
She's our best lead right now.

20:01.380 --> 20:02.369
Yeah.

20:09.830 --> 20:11.616
Ms. White, thanks for coming back in.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.247
You don't have to be so formal.
You can call me Miranda.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.610
Okay, Miranda. Are you ready?

20:16.620 --> 20:17.780
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:17.790 --> 20:21.282
I saw on the news that you found
another girl in our old building?

20:21.290 --> 20:23.326
-Yeah.
-Is she gonna be okay?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.996
She's, uh, she's with her family.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.662
She's going to be fine.
But she's just gonna need a little time.

20:34.170 --> 20:35.785
It's right in here. Have a seat.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.781
So when did you and your ex
start having problems?

20:45.380 --> 20:46.369
When didn't we?

20:46.920 --> 20:48.456
He was a drinker, among other things.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.996
I should have left that marriage sooner.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.570
Can you tell me more about that?

21:07.880 --> 21:09.450
But what about Danny?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.030
Was he a drinker?

21:11.540 --> 21:12.780
No.

21:12.790 --> 21:13.779
Maybe he did drugs?

21:15.120 --> 21:16.246
No.

21:17.750 --> 21:18.876
No.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.869
Why would you even think that?

21:20.170 --> 21:22.206
Drug use is something
we always have to consider.

21:22.460 --> 21:23.449
Oh...

21:29.420 --> 21:30.489
Not Danny.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.782
Are you okay

21:34.790 --> 21:35.779
No.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.416
I'm gonna get us some coffee, all right?

21:47.460 --> 21:49.246
Okay, here you go.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.239
Thanks.

21:57.380 --> 22:00.668
So we're looking for a location
where an imprint could have been made.

22:05.540 --> 22:06.700
Danny never had friends.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.417
What about a girlfriend?

22:09.420 --> 22:10.535
God knows, never.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.248
Never had a girlfriend.
He could never talk to girls.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.957
Cute as he was, he was just so

22:18.500 --> 22:19.489
awloNard.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.781
And sometimes inappropriate, you know?

22:23.920 --> 22:25.205
Like he had no filter.

22:31.210 --> 22:32.575
That doesn't make any sense.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.871
How do you go from being
awloNard with no friends

22:34.880 --> 22:36.780
to socially skilled and manipulative?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.786
I don't know.
The guy's got no onllne presence

22:38.790 --> 22:41.372
or social media. Maybe it's just
some kind of self-help thing

22:41.380 --> 22:42.415
and the guy got some confidence.

22:42.960 --> 22:46.919
I don't know. He's 23 and up until
a few weeks ago living with his mom.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.208
What if we were wrong
and charm's not part of his game?

22:50.210 --> 22:51.279
I don't think so.

22:51.290 --> 22:55.613
All those victims were smart, attractive,
and out in populated areas.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.747
I agree. He found a way to get close,

22:58.750 --> 23:00.615
and it has to have something
to do with the drugs.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.536
Hopefully the media coverage
will make it impossible

23:03.540 --> 23:06.373
for him to charm anyone
without them recognizing him first.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.206
What can I get you?

23:13.210 --> 23:14.575
A shot of Jack and a beer.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.377
What kind? We got like 20.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.205
Whatever's on draft.

23:19.210 --> 23:20.871
See, I'm lonely

23:21.500 --> 23:22.956
See, I'm sad

23:26.790 --> 23:28.326
You see I'm mad

23:29.420 --> 23:31.206
Smilin' for a day

23:32.120 --> 23:33.166
Fifteen.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.206
Keep it.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.245
Thank you.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.030
She didn't try

23:39.040 --> 23:41.076
You're never gonna make that shot.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.576
You're really not cool.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.706
Let's get it on.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.285
Trust me...

24:00.000 --> 24:01.376
Sweet.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.075
Thinking of you

24:03.750 --> 24:05.741
Sinking in wine

24:06.710 --> 24:08.166
All right, I'm ready.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.376
Unromantic here.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.116
...searching for
23-year-old Bronx native

24:17.120 --> 24:18.872
Daniel Allen White.

24:18.880 --> 24:23.249
White is currently wanted
for the recent Bone Crusher killings.

24:23.830 --> 24:27.414
Three local women have been murdered
In the last SIX weeks.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.455
Try it.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.109
Oh!

25:57.540 --> 25:58.825
We have to get a selfie.

25:58.830 --> 25:59.910
Oh, cool, perfect.

26:09.750 --> 26:10.705
Oh, my God! Oh!

26:15.120 --> 26:18.533
- -Clear the run, first tier.

26:19.580 --> 26:20.569
You go.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.161
Open it up!

26:24.120 --> 26:25.781
On the line!

26:52.170 --> 26:53.410
What did they do to him?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.991
He's in the infirmary.
Got a couple of broken ribs.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.740
They could have punctured his lungs.
They didn't.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.910
I told you, it's a test.

27:00.540 --> 27:03.418
-Are they gonna leave him alone now?
-I didn't say that.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.877
You know, Calvin, you're right.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.074
I don't know prison.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.661
But I do know how to stop a psychopath.

27:11.170 --> 27:14.662
That was out there.
In here, we're all psychopaths.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.241
We have to be,
'cause it's predator or prey.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.115
Which one are you?

27:34.670 --> 27:36.740
What do you want, inmate?

27:37.210 --> 27:40.247
Out of water. I was just
hoping to get a little more water.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.911
There's no water. Just go sit down.

27:52.380 --> 27:55.747
Twenty-six-year-old Lisa Jackson
was abducted last night in Brooklyn.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.571
Apparently she was walking
home from a bar with a friend

27:58.580 --> 28:00.161
when a man in an SUV pulled up,

28:00.170 --> 28:01.535
attacked them both with a hammer.

28:01.540 --> 28:03.076
Friend wakes up, Lisa's gone.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.320
He only took one of them.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.531
He only needs one.
Plus, two is a lot of work.

28:07.830 --> 28:09.821
Was the friend able
to give a description of the attacker?

28:10.250 --> 28:11.569
Yeah. Matches White.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.820
She said she saw him
having drinks at the bar earlier.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.159
He's out drinking.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.418
He's either arrogant or he's
just not paying attention to the news.

28:18.790 --> 28:20.530
Or he can't resist the urge to hunt.

28:21.420 --> 28:23.615
Well, what type of SUV did she say it was?

28:23.620 --> 28:25.030
Dark blue, maybe black.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.246
Said it happened pretty fast.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.410
She got hit in the head pretty good.

28:27.420 --> 28:29.706
I'll _have our field office assist
In canvassmg the area.

28:29.710 --> 28:30.825
Copy that.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.871
This guy, he knows we're onto him.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.576
He's not gonna wait long
before he starts breaking bones.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.785
Go sit down.

28:47.210 --> 28:48.746
-What was that?
-I was thirsty.

28:51.040 --> 28:54.783
I helped you because I like you.
You're interesting to me.

28:54.790 --> 28:57.611
But you keep this up,
keep thinking the normal rules

28:57.620 --> 29:00.282
apply in here, then I cannot help you.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.786
And that would be a shame, because I think

29:02.790 --> 29:04.610
you're the only innocent man in here.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.949
Good luck, brother.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.075
You're gonna need it.

29:21.210 --> 29:22.450
What have you got, Garcia?

29:22.460 --> 29:23.700
Actually, it's me and JJ.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.207
Hey, uh, so I was thinking,

29:26.620 --> 29:31.114
this guy's MO is pretty sophisticated
for a killer who's just started out.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.537
Maybe our first victim
isn't his first victim.

29:34.790 --> 29:36.746
So I had Garcia compile a list

29:36.750 --> 29:38.377
of all the females with bone break

29:38.750 --> 29:40.706
injuries in New York City
in the last three years.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.786
We ruled out women over 30,

29:43.040 --> 29:45.918
girls under 18, came up with 112 names.

29:46.210 --> 29:48.371
Did any of them have
drugs in their system,

29:48.380 --> 29:49.916
specifically MDMA?

29:49.920 --> 29:53.242
Oh, so good, new guy, who doesn't feel new

29:53.250 --> 29:54.990
because your deep
baritone voice comforts me.

29:55.540 --> 29:56.950
The answer is yes.

29:57.210 --> 29:58.700
But not all of them were drug tested,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.490
so we only have two that we know for sure

30:00.750 --> 30:02.706
-had MDMA on board.-Who are they?

30:02.710 --> 30:05.611
Well, there is one
in particular that caught my eye.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.667
Nancy Santiago.

30:07.670 --> 30:11.879
She's 22, she's from Long Island,
and she died after she fell off a rooftop

30:12.120 --> 30:13.826
during a rave almost a year ago.

30:13.830 --> 30:15.036
There any foul play?

30:15.040 --> 30:17.577
Inconclusive. There was
a thunderstorm that night,

30:17.580 --> 30:19.457
so the crime scene was compromised.

30:19.460 --> 30:24.375
The police report says two guys saw
what they thought was a male/female couple

30:26.960 --> 30:28.871
When those two guys spotted them,

30:28.880 --> 30:31.110
he took off, left the female behind.

30:31.380 --> 30:34.668
When they got closer,
they saw the girl was actually dead.

30:36.750 --> 30:39.708
The coroner said she had
several broken bones from the fall,

30:39.960 --> 30:43.612
most notably a compound
fracture, super serious,

30:43.620 --> 30:44.609
to her femur.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.748
Well, if there was sexual assault,
do we really think that was our guy?

30:51.210 --> 30:53.110
I want to know more.
Send us everything you have

30:53.120 --> 30:54.701
-on Nancy Santiago.-Done.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.162
We got a problem. I can't find
Miranda White. She's not in the building.

31:04.790 --> 31:05.870
Did you call her?

31:05.880 --> 31:08.496
Yeah. I left her two messages
and she's not returning texts.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.491
Maybe she needed some fresh air
or she got hungry or something.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.412
No. I gave her a sandwich.
She said she'd stay put.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.456
Shoot

31:15.460 --> 31:17.451
Garcia, we need you to track a cell phone.

31:26.790 --> 31:28.109
Hey.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.779
I'm surprised you came home.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.326
You get my texts?

31:41.080 --> 31:43.162
Something I said

31:45.330 --> 31:48.072
It's just, uh, why is he like this?

31:48.380 --> 31:49.608
What did I do wrong?

31:49.620 --> 31:53.329
No. Listen, Danny and people like Danny

31:53.710 --> 31:55.610
have an affliction, okay?

31:55.620 --> 31:56.609
It's like a sickness.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.577
They either choose to fight it
or they embrace it,

31:59.580 --> 32:01.787
and it's no one's fault.

32:07.290 --> 32:08.951
Miranda, another girl went missing.

32:09.620 --> 32:12.532
Now, we still have time to find her,
but we need your help.

32:12.540 --> 32:14.371
And you can help save her
just like the other girl.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.661
What can I do? I don't know anything.

32:16.670 --> 32:18.069
You know more than you think.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.371
Do you recognize this girl?

32:24.380 --> 32:26.280
Her name is Nancy Santiago.

32:26.290 --> 32:28.497
Now, a year ago, she fell off a rooftop

32:28.500 --> 32:29.819
at a rave and she died.

32:29.830 --> 32:31.991
How am I supposed to remember something
that happened a year ago?

32:33.250 --> 32:35.161
There was a big thunderstorm that night.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.990
That ring a bell?

32:44.580 --> 32:47.378
Remember how I told you I kicked Danny out

32:47.380 --> 32:50.452
because he came home with blood on him
but he wasn't hurt?

32:50.460 --> 32:51.449
Yeah.

32:51.710 --> 32:53.610
That wasn't the only time that happened.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.819
It happened last year, too,

32:55.830 --> 32:57.457
and it was raining hard that night, and...

33:02.040 --> 33:04.782
Miranda, when I asked you
about Danny and the drugs,

33:04.790 --> 33:07.076
it was like you wanted
to say something but you couldn't.

33:07.330 --> 33:08.661
Now, I gotta be honest with you.

33:08.670 --> 33:11.537
The one thing that connects
all of these victims

33:11.540 --> 33:14.247
is the drugs, the MDMA.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.369
Ecstasy.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.822
Something in my gut is telling me
that the answer to where Danny is

33:20.830 --> 33:21.990
has something to do with that.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.917
Ijust was trying to help him.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.871
Help him what?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.820
Talk. Feel.

33:35.830 --> 33:38.913
God forbid, smile, maybe.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.782
I read these articles about ecstasy

33:42.790 --> 33:44.746
and how it could help people like Danny.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.206
Did you give Danny the drugs?

33:56.790 --> 33:58.781
At first, just a little.

33:59.710 --> 34:02.702
I mean, he was 21,
and I could at least test it

34:02.710 --> 34:05.702
and make sure that it was pure
and more safe, you know?

34:06.710 --> 34:07.916
And it worked.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.615
He was so happy.

34:10.620 --> 34:13.111
We talked. We talked

34:13.120 --> 34:15.668
and we sat out here
and we talked for hours.

34:22.710 --> 34:28.956
But after a while, it stopped working.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.575
So that's how he went
from socially awkward

34:40.580 --> 34:42.036
to socially skilled... The drugs.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.076
That makes sense.
His inhibitions would be lowered

34:44.080 --> 34:45.411
and he'd be emboldened.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.247
But repeated use could mean addiction

34:48.250 --> 34:50.286
and a higher tolerance, so he would need

34:50.290 --> 34:51.871
increasingly larger doses.

34:52.830 --> 34:53.990
His mother was trying to help him,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.616
but she may have unlocked
the psychopath in him instead.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.532
MDMA is supposed to enhance sexuality.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.576
If Nancy Santiago was his first victim

35:02.580 --> 35:03.911
and he was high when he killed her,

35:03.920 --> 35:05.660
that must have made quite an impression.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.070
And since it's never as good
as the first time,

35:08.080 --> 35:10.492
he's probably been
chasing that dragon ever since.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.491
He probably needs to be
under the influence himself

35:12.500 --> 35:14.411
to complete the experience.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.206
Yeah, but if
that was him in the alley

35:16.210 --> 35:18.917
with Nancy Santiago's body,
then why no sexual assault

35:18.920 --> 35:19.989
with his most recent victims?

35:20.880 --> 35:22.575
Because MDMA can cause impotence.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.957
Yeah. Maybe he can't sexually get off

35:24.960 --> 35:26.780
and that only adds to his rage.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.417
That's why he's been so violent.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.910
- -Torture is an outlet for that.

35:30.710 --> 35:31.950
Yeah, what have you got, Garcia?

35:31.960 --> 35:33.916
I've got the 411 on that rave

35:33.920 --> 35:36.070
that Nancy Santiago was at the night died.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.069
I've sent it all to your tablets.

35:37.330 --> 35:39.161
You can follow along if you wish.

35:39.170 --> 35:42.207
It is a roving EDM party
called Reclamation,

35:42.210 --> 35:44.826
and according to their website,
their mission is to, quote,

35:44.830 --> 35:47.116
"Bring light and rhythm
to places long forgotten."

35:47.120 --> 35:48.280
Which means?

35:48.290 --> 35:50.246
Sir, that's the millennial way of saying,

35:50.250 --> 35:51.956
"We have illegal parties
in abandoned places."

35:58.920 --> 36:00.069
Right there.

36:00.790 --> 36:04.032
Abandoned spaces. We should
go check out where this rave was.

36:04.040 --> 36:06.497
Yeah, considering this guy's
pattern of late, that's not a bad idea.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.706
Garcia, is that building still there?

36:09.920 --> 36:11.820
Yeah. And it's still unoccupied.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.376
Alvez, Walker, Dave, go.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.781
No! No!
-Shut up.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.877
- No!
-Shut up!

36:22.830 --> 36:25.412
No!No!No!

36:26.330 --> 36:27.570
Ahhh!

36:28.040 --> 36:29.576
You're gonna break
every bone in your body.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.116
No! No!

36:47.460 --> 36:49.166
Check it out... Blood.

36:49.170 --> 36:50.285
I'll call for backup.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.916
Ahhh! No, please!

36:54.920 --> 36:56.114
I want to hear how much it hurts.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.489
Please don't.

37:01.170 --> 37:03.661
Ahhh!

37:05.330 --> 37:07.321
Did you hear that, the way it cracked?

37:07.670 --> 37:09.035
Let's do another one.

37:09.290 --> 37:11.952
Daniel Allen White, FBI, drop it!

37:13.460 --> 37:14.779
No, no, no, back up.

37:15.210 --> 37:16.529
we can't do that.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.167
Just drop it and let her go.

37:18.170 --> 37:20.240
Daniel, just drop it!

37:21.330 --> 37:23.707
I'll take you to see your mother.
She's waiting for you.

37:24.750 --> 37:25.739
Liar.

37:26.330 --> 37:27.319
No. I'm telling the truth.

37:27.670 --> 37:28.659
Her name's Miranda.

37:29.250 --> 37:30.911
How do you think we found
your old apartment?

37:31.920 --> 37:33.319
Look, I'm not going to jail.

37:33.670 --> 37:35.240
-Danny, don't.
-I'|| die in there.

37:35.500 --> 37:36.569
Don't... Don't do it!

37:43.120 --> 37:44.200
Tell my mom I'm sorry.

37:54.750 --> 37:55.739
All right.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.821
You

38:17.040 --> 38:19.372
Crawling back home

38:22.120 --> 38:26.329
And the rain came falling like a stone

38:30.420 --> 38:33.662
You

38:34.540 --> 38:36.701
Walking all alone

38:39.790 --> 38:43.248
Can't stand the night on your own

38:47.830 --> 38:54.372
All the time behind you left to find

38:58.500 --> 39:04.951
Look inside for signs of waking...

39:07.620 --> 39:10.453
Bring it all together

39:10.460 --> 39:11.666
Hey.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.166
What are you hammering?

39:13.580 --> 39:17.493
Oh, uh, just hanging up
my newest acquisition.

39:18.670 --> 39:20.285
A "W"?

39:20.290 --> 39:22.702
Well, that's not just any old "W".

39:23.580 --> 39:27.789
That, my young friend,
is a symbol of victory.

39:30.210 --> 39:31.279
You're not a baseball fan, are you?

39:32.040 --> 39:34.668
Mostly hockey,
and I do enjoy a football game.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.668
Well, at Wrigley Field,
the home of the Chicago Cubs,

39:38.670 --> 39:41.241
they fly that flag after every win.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.240
Wait, you're not even from Chicago.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.280
No.

39:50.170 --> 39:51.910
But I lost a good buddy
in Vietnam who was.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.827
And, uh, since they won the World Series,

39:56.830 --> 39:59.116
I thought I'd commemorate it for him

39:59.120 --> 40:01.111
since he didn't live long
enough to see it himself.

40:02.290 --> 40:03.450
That's sweet.

40:07.290 --> 40:08.370
Hey, what's going on with you?

40:11.080 --> 40:13.571
Now that I've seen Spence locked up, it...

40:14.460 --> 40:16.951
Wasn't easy.
I guess I'm just a little down.

40:20.790 --> 40:24.203
Do you know how long it's been since
the Cubs last won the Series?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.742
That's like 100 years, right?

40:28.540 --> 40:30.531
One hundred and eight, to be exact.

40:31.580 --> 40:34.037
Which means that
generations lived and died

40:34.040 --> 40:35.917
without ever seeing a championship.

40:37.540 --> 40:38.916
Can you imagine what
that does to your psyche?

40:39.540 --> 40:40.575
Hmm.

40:41.750 --> 40:46.119
But that city and all those fans...

40:47.920 --> 40:49.376
You know what kept them going?

40:51.580 --> 40:52.740
Hope.

40:54.790 --> 40:57.247
Until finally, one night,

40:57.750 --> 41:00.036
after over a century of despair,

41:01.620 --> 41:02.951
hope won.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.916
And that's how we're gonna keep going,

41:06.460 --> 41:08.530
until we get that kid
the hell out of there.

41:11.830 --> 41:12.819
Hope.

41:15.670 --> 41:17.319
Keep it alive.

41:18.620 --> 41:21.612
'Cause I'm afraid right now,
that's all we've got.

41:25.500 --> 41:29.072
"Hope is being able
to see that there is light,

41:29.830 --> 41:31.991
"despite all of the darkness."

41:33.120 --> 41:34.371
Desmond Tutu.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.780
What's up, snitch?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.706
That your girlfriend come to see you?

41:44.290 --> 41:45.279
She's my friend.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.166
You never got any?

41:49.380 --> 41:50.995
What's wrong with you, man?

41:59.880 --> 42:01.029
Help!

42:04.790 --> 42:05.779
Snuff him!
