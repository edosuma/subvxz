WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:05.772
When you say
you have feelings for her,

00:09.342 --> 00:12.112
are you in love with her?

00:13.580 --> 00:14.515
No.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.551
Not at all.

00:17.584 --> 00:20.153
But I might see her again,

00:21.922 --> 00:23.056
and I didn't want you
to hear it

00:23.089 --> 00:24.858
at the office.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.493
I thought it should come
from me.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.432
Have you two slept together?

00:33.834 --> 00:36.302
(music playing)

00:36.903 --> 00:37.904
(sighs)

00:40.140 --> 00:41.474
Unbelievable.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.009
DONNELL: Look, I don't think
it's a good idea

00:43.043 --> 00:44.110
for us to talk about--

00:44.144 --> 00:45.779
What are we talking about, then?

00:45.812 --> 00:47.948
DONNELL: Lindsay,

00:47.981 --> 00:50.651
whatever our future will be,

00:50.684 --> 00:52.018
if we stop communicating--

00:52.052 --> 00:53.920
Can I stop you for a second?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.756
You and I have no future.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.067
I appreciate you taking me
off the hook here.

01:01.101 --> 01:03.369
But I was beginning
to feel like the bad guy,

01:03.403 --> 01:05.405
but now I don't.

01:05.438 --> 01:07.440
I can pursue what I want

01:07.473 --> 01:09.308
with a much lighter heart,

01:10.443 --> 01:12.345
and what I want...

01:12.378 --> 01:13.213
is a divorce.

01:16.082 --> 01:18.418
You might think
I'm acting out of hurt

01:18.451 --> 01:20.921
or pride,

01:20.954 --> 01:23.089
but this isn't that.

01:23.123 --> 01:24.558
I'm not speaking
from wound,

01:24.591 --> 01:26.092
but rather from a reflective

01:26.126 --> 01:29.530
and reasoned clarity.

01:29.563 --> 01:32.833
If you've never believed
anything I've told you,

01:32.866 --> 01:35.702
please, believe this.

01:36.803 --> 01:38.872
I do not wish to live
my life with you,

01:39.873 --> 01:40.841
not now,

01:40.874 --> 01:43.209
not a month from now,

01:43.243 --> 01:44.044
not ever.

01:53.086 --> 01:56.322
(music playing)

02:43.544 --> 02:44.778
They're divorcing?

02:44.811 --> 02:45.812
HATCHER: That's the word.

02:45.846 --> 02:46.813
WASHINGTON:
Where'd you get this word?

02:46.847 --> 02:47.748
From Bobby.

02:47.781 --> 02:48.615
He called in

02:48.649 --> 02:49.850
and said if the papers
got delivered,

02:49.883 --> 02:50.884
I can accept.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.052
BERLUTI: They just separated.

02:52.085 --> 02:54.187
How--
It's probably that slut's idea.

02:54.220 --> 02:56.022
Talking about me, Rebecca?

02:57.558 --> 02:59.560
You? No!

02:59.593 --> 03:00.967
I was talking about--

03:02.468 --> 03:03.870
A different slut.

03:04.671 --> 03:05.772
(chuckles)

03:09.442 --> 03:10.811
DOLE: Jimmy,

03:10.844 --> 03:12.613
I have some depositions
scheduled today

03:12.646 --> 03:15.415
on a negligence claim
that, uh...

03:15.448 --> 03:17.751
I'm not really up
to doing them.

03:19.119 --> 03:20.453
If I get you up to speed,

03:20.486 --> 03:21.822
could you cover for me?

03:23.724 --> 03:24.825
Sure.

03:25.759 --> 03:26.693
I'll get the file.

03:31.197 --> 03:32.766
She is 9 months pregnant!

03:32.799 --> 03:34.701
Her due date
isn't until June 5th.

03:34.735 --> 03:36.169
This will be
a three-day trial.

03:36.202 --> 03:38.705
And what happens if she goes
into labor the first day?

03:38.739 --> 03:41.074
Is there a reason you don't
wanna wait a month, Mr. Young?

03:41.107 --> 03:42.643
Of course there's a reason.

03:42.676 --> 03:43.810
He wants the jury to see

03:43.844 --> 03:45.045
a pregnant mother-to-be

03:45.078 --> 03:46.146
instead of a murderer.

03:46.179 --> 03:47.413
He's probably instructed her

03:47.447 --> 03:48.849
to give birth
during the closings.

03:48.882 --> 03:50.517
KITTLESON:
Yes, thank you for that.

03:50.551 --> 03:52.553
Since I addressed
my question to Mr. Young,

03:52.586 --> 03:54.921
maybe we could let him answer.

03:54.955 --> 03:55.722
YOUNG: For the record,

03:55.756 --> 03:57.824
I advised my client to postpone.

03:57.858 --> 03:58.892
She doesn't want to.

03:58.925 --> 04:00.934
She has a right
to a speedy trial,

04:00.967 --> 04:01.935
and that's what she wants.

04:02.468 --> 04:04.605
Mrs. Neilson, why?

04:08.509 --> 04:09.710
I wanna put this trial

04:09.743 --> 04:11.512
behind me, Your Honor.

04:11.545 --> 04:12.679
When I have my baby,

04:12.713 --> 04:15.048
I want everything else over.

04:15.081 --> 04:16.382
What about the stress?

04:16.416 --> 04:18.184
This is not traffic court.

04:18.218 --> 04:20.887
You are being charged
with first-degree murder.

04:20.921 --> 04:23.256
Your own doctor is saying,
"Let's wait."

04:23.289 --> 04:24.891
Well, I'm of sound mind,

04:24.925 --> 04:26.226
so any medical decision

04:26.259 --> 04:27.093
would be mine.

04:27.127 --> 04:29.896
And it's your choice
to go forward now?

04:29.930 --> 04:32.065
Yes, Your Honor.

04:32.098 --> 04:33.900
I want this ordeal over with.

04:37.003 --> 04:38.638
Okay, then.

04:38.672 --> 04:39.673
Let's bring in the jury.

04:44.845 --> 04:46.813
Jimmy Berluti?
DOLE: Claire...

04:46.847 --> 04:48.448
He isn't even in this firm.

04:48.481 --> 04:49.550
Please don't start with me now.

04:49.583 --> 04:50.917
CLAIRE: I'm just saying--
DOLE: You're upset

04:50.951 --> 04:51.885
that I didn't
let you run with it.

04:51.918 --> 04:52.619
I understand.

04:53.286 --> 04:54.521
I'd like to know why.

04:55.956 --> 04:58.024
You're too green, okay?

04:58.058 --> 04:59.560
The case could turn
on these depositions,

04:59.593 --> 05:01.434
and it could be malpractice
for me to vest it

05:01.467 --> 05:03.103
with an attorney
just out of law school,

05:03.804 --> 05:04.705
and if that hurts,

05:04.738 --> 05:06.940
well, hurt happens.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.476
Just give Jimmy whatever
backup he needs,

05:10.511 --> 05:11.477
and if you need to reach me,

05:11.512 --> 05:12.713
I'll be
at Nancy Decker's office.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.181
Nancy Decker,
the divorce lawyer?

05:15.215 --> 05:16.116
Yes.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.787
Ms. Dole.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.856
I'm sorry.
I can't talk now.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.157
Don't we have a meeting?

05:24.190 --> 05:26.159
I'll be handling it.

05:28.094 --> 05:29.095
Hi, Virginia.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.731
How are you today?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.566
NAOMI: Don't we have
depositions?

05:32.599 --> 05:34.200
Yes, I'll be doing them.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.369
You? What happened to Lindsay?

05:36.402 --> 05:37.838
Ms. Carter,

05:37.871 --> 05:39.005
everything's in good hands.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.273
You need not worry.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.408
We also have Jimmy Berluti,
another attorney,

05:42.442 --> 05:43.577
joining us for the deposition,

05:43.610 --> 05:44.911
so we are in excellent shape.

05:50.884 --> 05:51.985
McGUIRE: At the time I arrived,

05:52.018 --> 05:53.086
the uniform officers

05:53.119 --> 05:54.688
already had the defendant
in custody.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.923
Could you tell the jury
your observations

05:56.957 --> 05:58.391
of the scene, detective?

05:58.424 --> 06:00.466
There was blood
spattered everywhere,

06:00.501 --> 06:02.435
the ceiling,
the walls,

06:02.468 --> 06:03.236
on the toaster.

06:03.269 --> 06:04.805
KUPCHECK:
Did the spatter pattern

06:04.838 --> 06:06.039
suggest anything to you?

06:06.072 --> 06:09.475
The victim was shot
at point-blank range six times.

06:09.510 --> 06:10.844
Several of those shots
were fired

06:10.877 --> 06:12.746
after the victim
was on the ground,

06:12.779 --> 06:13.647
helpless.

06:14.147 --> 06:15.148
Did you have an opportunity

06:15.181 --> 06:16.617
to speak with the defendant,

06:16.650 --> 06:18.719
Carrie Neilson?
McGUIRE: Yes.

06:18.752 --> 06:19.853
She confessed
to the shooting,

06:19.886 --> 06:21.421
as she had on the 911 tape.

06:21.454 --> 06:22.923
And what was her demeanor

06:22.956 --> 06:24.758
as she confessed
this crime to you?

06:24.791 --> 06:26.660
Calm, detached,

06:26.693 --> 06:28.895
without remorse.

06:28.929 --> 06:30.597
This was not
a woman in distress.

06:32.132 --> 06:34.601
STRINGER: Did she say
why she shot her husband?

06:34.635 --> 06:36.770
She said
he was physically abusive

06:36.803 --> 06:37.904
and she was concerned
for the health

06:37.938 --> 06:38.939
of her unborn child.

06:38.972 --> 06:41.074
In fact, she said
she was afraid her husband

06:41.107 --> 06:42.743
would kill the child.

06:42.776 --> 06:44.077
Objection to the word "child"

06:44.110 --> 06:45.211
at the time of the shooting,

06:45.245 --> 06:46.412
this was a two-month fetus,

06:46.446 --> 06:47.548
not a child--
STRINGER: I asked the witness

06:47.581 --> 06:48.649
what the defendant said.

06:48.682 --> 06:50.483
The word she used
was "child,"

06:50.517 --> 06:51.618
was it not, detective?

06:51.652 --> 06:52.485
Yes.

06:52.519 --> 06:54.220
The objection is overruled.

06:54.254 --> 06:55.989
STRINGER: The six shots,

06:56.022 --> 06:57.691
they were fired
from an automatic

06:57.724 --> 06:58.659
in rapid succession,

06:58.692 --> 06:59.492
isn't that right?

06:59.526 --> 07:01.067
They appear to have been, yes.

07:01.101 --> 07:02.503
Within two to three seconds?

07:02.536 --> 07:03.970
Probably.

07:04.004 --> 07:04.838
STRINGER: And detective,

07:04.871 --> 07:06.707
have you ever encountered
a situation

07:06.740 --> 07:08.408
in which a person
under attack

07:08.441 --> 07:11.144
keeps shooting even
after the attack is over?

07:11.177 --> 07:13.479
Yes--
STRINGER: So it's possible

07:13.514 --> 07:15.782
my client fired off
the first shot or two

07:15.816 --> 07:17.818
in defense of her unborn child

07:17.851 --> 07:19.620
and just kept
squeezing the trigger

07:19.653 --> 07:20.554
while still in shock.

07:20.587 --> 07:21.822
That's possible,

07:21.855 --> 07:23.256
isn't it, detective?

07:23.289 --> 07:25.325
Anything's possible, counsel.

07:29.195 --> 07:30.731
If at any time
you get confused,

07:30.764 --> 07:32.498
you just tell me, okay,
Virginia?

07:32.533 --> 07:34.300
Okay.

07:34.334 --> 07:36.369
And you understand
I represent White Oaks,

07:36.402 --> 07:37.538
the apartment complex

07:37.571 --> 07:40.073
where you live, right?
Yes.

07:40.106 --> 07:41.174
SLOAN:
Did your lawyers tell you

07:41.207 --> 07:42.375
I'd be against you?

07:43.043 --> 07:44.010
Yeah.

07:44.044 --> 07:45.211
SLOAN: Well,

07:45.245 --> 07:46.947
I'll try not to be a big meanie.

07:48.148 --> 07:50.784
Really, I just wanna
find out what happened.

07:51.918 --> 07:54.087
Now, this happened
at a party, right?

07:54.120 --> 07:55.889
Yes,

07:55.922 --> 07:57.658
we were having
a birthday party.

07:57.691 --> 07:58.659
Your birthday?

07:59.159 --> 07:59.793
Yeah.

07:59.826 --> 08:00.901
How old?

08:00.934 --> 08:02.035
Ten.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.169
Ten?

08:03.203 --> 08:04.437
Wow.

08:04.470 --> 08:05.606
That's a big one.

08:05.639 --> 08:07.040
I bet you were really excited.

08:07.073 --> 08:08.241
Yeah.

08:08.274 --> 08:10.577
Know how old I am?

08:10.611 --> 08:11.311
A hundred.

08:11.344 --> 08:13.079
(chuckles)

08:15.616 --> 08:17.518
Some of the guests
said you were jumping

08:17.551 --> 08:19.185
on the balcony,

08:19.219 --> 08:20.120
is that right?

08:20.987 --> 08:21.855
Yes.

08:21.888 --> 08:23.223
And were you also jumping

08:23.256 --> 08:24.891
against the rail, Virginia?

08:25.391 --> 08:26.727
It just broke.

08:27.628 --> 08:29.295
You must have been so scared.

08:30.463 --> 08:31.565
I was.

08:31.598 --> 08:34.000
Do you remember where
your mom was when you fell?

08:36.102 --> 08:37.837
I think in the kitchen.

08:43.308 --> 08:44.144
First of all,

08:44.177 --> 08:45.746
I'm not a divorce lawyer, Bobby.

08:45.779 --> 08:47.247
That's a whole different
breed of bug.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.283
And second, even if I were,
I'm a little too close.

08:50.316 --> 08:51.885
DONNELL: It's not going
to be complicated

08:51.918 --> 08:53.219
or even contested.

08:53.253 --> 08:55.188
I just wanna get it done.

08:55.221 --> 08:56.690
FRUTT: Speaking professionally,

08:56.723 --> 08:58.525
I don't think
that's a sound approach,

08:58.559 --> 08:59.760
and speaking personally,

08:59.793 --> 09:01.167
I'm offended by it.

09:01.968 --> 09:03.904
You have a son.

09:03.937 --> 09:05.271
You both have a duty

09:05.305 --> 09:06.773
to explore reconciliation.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.208
How could you possibly

09:08.241 --> 09:09.810
prioritize expediency over--

09:09.843 --> 09:11.477
I'm not asking you
to interfere

09:11.512 --> 09:12.478
with my life, Ellenor.
Since--

09:12.513 --> 09:13.814
I am in your life, Bobby!

09:13.847 --> 09:15.181
So is Rebecca!
So is everybody else

09:15.215 --> 09:16.082
in this office!

09:16.116 --> 09:18.218
Whether you want us in
is beside the point.

09:18.251 --> 09:19.920
I don't.
FRUTT: Well, we are!

09:19.953 --> 09:22.856
(music playing)

09:23.990 --> 09:25.826
And as your friend,

09:25.859 --> 09:27.528
as a parent myself,

09:27.561 --> 09:29.495
I am telling you,

09:29.530 --> 09:31.532
go get your hands dirty

09:31.565 --> 09:32.766
in therapy before--

09:32.799 --> 09:34.568
It's her, okay?

09:35.335 --> 09:36.970
Lindsay's mind is made up.

09:37.003 --> 09:38.805
She's immovable.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.574
Given that,
the best way to spare my son

09:40.607 --> 09:42.475
is to get it done.

09:45.646 --> 09:47.247
Is there going to be
a custody issue?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.650
No, she's taking him weekdays.

09:49.683 --> 09:51.117
I get him weekends.

09:55.355 --> 09:57.691
There's no rule this
has to be messy, you know.

09:59.059 --> 10:01.535
There's gotta be a rule
against it being simple.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.048
I can't believe
you have a murder trial.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.149
STRINGER: Me neither.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.984
Is there a reason
you're on this?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.753
I know you're good,

10:19.786 --> 10:21.021
but still,

10:21.054 --> 10:22.288
a year out of law school?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.625
I think Eugene
wanted a woman on board

10:24.658 --> 10:26.660
since there are implied

10:26.693 --> 10:28.695
Roe V. Wade issues
running through this.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.896
Roe V. Wade?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.397
The fetus wasn't viable

10:31.431 --> 10:33.166
at the time of the shooting.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.869
We're arguing defense
of others, so--

10:35.902 --> 10:37.203
CLAIRE: Is that
a problem for you?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.640
I mean,
being a pro-choice woman?

10:39.673 --> 10:40.907
Not really, plus--

10:41.775 --> 10:42.709
Plus what?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.446
I love working with Eugene.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.414
He's so far and away
the best lawyer

10:48.448 --> 10:49.082
in this firm.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.551
I'm afraid of him.

10:50.584 --> 10:51.618
I said, "Hi," once,

10:51.652 --> 10:53.386
and he kind of,
hmm, grunted, yes.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.055
(laughs)

10:59.392 --> 11:01.301
Do you think it'd
be incredibly inappropriate

11:01.334 --> 11:02.402
if I asked him out?

11:02.936 --> 11:04.538
Yes! Hello?

11:04.571 --> 11:06.907
Well, he's never
going to ask me out.

11:06.940 --> 11:08.374
He's too principled,

11:08.408 --> 11:11.444
which means if we were
to ever date,

11:12.212 --> 11:13.880
I'd have to make the move.

11:15.982 --> 11:17.217
Claire,

11:17.250 --> 11:18.351
we're set?

11:18.384 --> 11:19.786
I'm ready.

11:19.820 --> 11:21.221
You prepped this woman, right?

11:21.254 --> 11:22.122
Oh, she's prepped.

11:22.155 --> 11:23.056
She's ready.

11:23.089 --> 11:23.757
Let's go.

11:28.228 --> 11:30.797
BARKER: It isn't really
true, though, is it?

11:30.831 --> 11:31.464
What?

11:31.497 --> 11:33.433
That it's Lindsay's doing.

11:33.466 --> 11:34.568
You orchestrated it,

11:34.601 --> 11:35.669
don't you think?

11:35.702 --> 11:36.870
I didn't orchestrate her

11:36.903 --> 11:38.171
falling out of love with me.

11:38.204 --> 11:39.105
Fair enough.

11:39.139 --> 11:42.075
Wives do that
with husbands all the time,

11:42.108 --> 11:44.945
but they don't leave
when there are children involved

11:44.978 --> 11:46.179
unless pushed.

11:47.781 --> 11:48.815
And I pushed her?

11:49.816 --> 11:50.517
You kissed me.

11:50.551 --> 11:52.018
You slept with me.

11:52.052 --> 11:53.787
One could argue
that you traded

11:53.820 --> 11:54.888
on her self-respect

11:54.921 --> 11:55.889
and manipulated things.

11:55.922 --> 11:57.257
Are you my therapist now?

11:58.224 --> 12:00.500
No, I'm the mistress

12:00.534 --> 12:01.968
or maybe I'm just the device

12:02.002 --> 12:04.437
that helps you end
your marriage.

12:08.675 --> 12:09.910
All right, this is crazy.

12:09.943 --> 12:10.811
Let's postpone.

12:11.878 --> 12:13.446
No.
YOUNG: Carrie, you're in pain.

12:13.479 --> 12:14.681
The baby could be in distress.

12:15.215 --> 12:16.082
Is he?

12:16.116 --> 12:17.483
I don't know, Carrie,

12:17.518 --> 12:18.519
but why take the risk?

12:19.553 --> 12:21.822
I don't wanna
give birth in custody!

12:21.855 --> 12:23.356
They'll just
take him away from me.

12:23.389 --> 12:25.225
I want the trial over.

12:25.258 --> 12:27.227
I wanna have him
on the outside.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.930
Carrie, we could lose,

12:29.963 --> 12:32.699
in which case--

12:32.733 --> 12:35.401
you'll probably
get more visitation in jail

12:35.435 --> 12:36.603
than you could in prison.

12:39.573 --> 12:40.741
These are just contractions,

12:40.774 --> 12:41.441
like you said.

12:43.443 --> 12:44.611
I wanna keep going.

12:45.512 --> 12:46.713
I wanna have my baby

12:46.747 --> 12:49.115
in a real hospital,

12:49.149 --> 12:50.416
not in a jail.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.522
NAOMI: My kitchen has a window,

12:55.556 --> 12:57.290
so I could see her.
I understand,

12:57.323 --> 12:58.291
but my question was,

12:58.324 --> 13:00.233
do you think it was safe
for her to play

13:00.266 --> 13:01.702
on the second-story balcony?

13:02.569 --> 13:04.404
I assumed
the balcony was safe.

13:04.437 --> 13:06.773
SLOAN: It never previously
struck you as unsafe,

13:06.807 --> 13:08.174
did it?
No.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.109
SLOAN: And you never called

13:09.142 --> 13:10.877
the White Oaks
Management Company

13:10.911 --> 13:12.679
about the railing
outside your apartment,

13:12.713 --> 13:13.346
did you?

13:13.379 --> 13:14.480
No.

13:15.181 --> 13:16.316
SLOAN: How many times a day

13:16.349 --> 13:18.384
would you say you
looked at that railing?

13:18.418 --> 13:19.886
I don't have time
to sit around

13:19.920 --> 13:20.954
and look at a railing.

13:20.987 --> 13:22.623
SLOAN: I know,
but how many times a day,

13:22.656 --> 13:24.858
on average,
do you think you see it?

13:24.891 --> 13:25.959
A dozen?

13:25.992 --> 13:27.861
Two dozen?
Maybe 10

13:27.894 --> 13:29.262
if you count
the times I see it

13:29.295 --> 13:30.496
from inside the kitchen.

13:30.531 --> 13:31.431
SLOAN: And how long
did you live

13:31.464 --> 13:33.834
in this apartment
before the accident?

13:33.867 --> 13:36.202
About four years.
SLOAN: Okay,

13:36.236 --> 13:38.572
three hundred
sixty-five times four

13:38.605 --> 13:41.842
makes one thousand
four hundred sixty days.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.510
If you looked ten times a day

13:43.544 --> 13:45.178
for four years,

13:45.211 --> 13:46.479
assuming my math is correct,

13:46.513 --> 13:48.314
you looked at that
railing roughly

13:48.348 --> 13:50.884
14,600 times

13:50.917 --> 13:52.619
before the accident,

13:52.653 --> 13:54.254
and not once
did you notice anything

13:54.287 --> 13:55.288
was wrong with it.

13:55.321 --> 13:56.222
Isn't that right?

13:57.658 --> 13:58.559
(door opens)

13:58.592 --> 14:01.001
What the hell
was all that about?

14:01.034 --> 14:03.570
Four times
three sixty-five times ten.

14:03.604 --> 14:05.171
What's that got to do
with anything?

14:05.205 --> 14:07.708
Here's our problem,

14:07.741 --> 14:09.743
the defendant
isn't really negligent

14:09.776 --> 14:11.111
for not fixing the railing

14:11.144 --> 14:12.412
if they had no way of knowing

14:12.445 --> 14:13.079
it was broken.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.314
What are you talking about?

14:14.347 --> 14:15.682
They have an ongoing duty

14:15.716 --> 14:17.183
to inspect and repair.

14:17.217 --> 14:19.319
Yes, and the file is full

14:19.352 --> 14:20.253
of maintenance reports

14:20.286 --> 14:21.822
that say they did exactly that.

14:22.455 --> 14:23.524
Not one report says

14:23.557 --> 14:24.991
the railing was loose or broken,

14:25.025 --> 14:26.860
and now they've
got your testimony

14:26.893 --> 14:28.729
that you've never noticed
anything wrong either.

14:28.762 --> 14:31.031
CLAIRE:
But the way Virginia fell--

14:31.064 --> 14:32.432
that railing
had to be broken.

14:32.465 --> 14:34.668
We have to be able
to prove that.

14:34.701 --> 14:36.002
It's their building,

14:36.036 --> 14:37.270
for God's sake!

14:37.838 --> 14:40.340
Naomi, look,

14:40.373 --> 14:41.608
this is going to be

14:41.642 --> 14:43.510
a very tough case to win.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.046
My suggestion would be,

14:46.079 --> 14:48.181
let me see
if I can get something.

14:48.214 --> 14:50.751
By "something"
you mean how much?

14:51.484 --> 14:52.519
If we can get,

14:52.553 --> 14:55.121
say, 50,000,

14:55.155 --> 14:56.156
we should think about it.

14:58.992 --> 15:02.736
My daughter
will be in a wheelchair

15:02.769 --> 15:05.038
for the rest of her life.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.608
For that, we're supposed

15:07.641 --> 15:09.810
to accept $50,000?

15:10.877 --> 15:12.312
The damages to your daughter

15:12.345 --> 15:14.581
are obviously immeasurable.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.051
Unfortunately,
I don't know

15:18.084 --> 15:21.154
if we can prove
what we need to prove.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.724
I don't believe this.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.895
My daughter can't walk.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.132
She can't walk.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.308
They fought a lot,

15:42.342 --> 15:43.644
but it escalated dramatically

15:43.677 --> 15:44.477
after she got pregnant.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.112
By "fought," you mean?

15:46.146 --> 15:46.980
A lot of screaming,

15:47.013 --> 15:48.281
but it got physical, too.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.750
I could hear it right
through the walls.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.285
YOUNG: And Mr. Gaul,
you live in the apartment

15:52.318 --> 15:54.254
next to Mrs. Neilson
and the victim?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.355
Correct.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.090
And Mr. Gaul,
were you able to hear

15:57.123 --> 15:59.159
the substance
of their arguments?

15:59.192 --> 16:00.500
Typically, no,

16:00.534 --> 16:02.302
because I really didn't care to.

16:02.335 --> 16:04.070
I'd turn my television up.

16:04.104 --> 16:06.439
But I did specifically
hear him screaming

16:06.472 --> 16:08.074
that he didn't want her
to have it,

16:08.108 --> 16:09.810
presumably the baby.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.512
I also specifically heard her

16:11.545 --> 16:13.313
on more than one occasion

16:13.346 --> 16:14.280
screaming at him

16:14.314 --> 16:15.281
that he was hurting her.

16:15.315 --> 16:17.984
Did you ever do
anything yourself?

16:18.018 --> 16:20.020
I intervened when I thought
he was hurting her.

16:20.053 --> 16:21.021
When he wasn't around,

16:21.054 --> 16:23.023
I tried another form
of intervention,

16:23.056 --> 16:24.157
which was trying
to persuade her

16:24.190 --> 16:25.191
to leave the man.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.227
Did you ever call the police?

16:27.260 --> 16:29.462
I called them the night
I heard the shots,

16:29.495 --> 16:30.697
and I called them once before

16:30.731 --> 16:31.865
when I thought
he was physically

16:31.898 --> 16:33.534
attacking her.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.836
According to your statement
to the police,

16:35.869 --> 16:38.271
you either intervened
or called the police

16:38.304 --> 16:39.606
every time you heard sounds

16:39.640 --> 16:40.941
of physical abuse

16:40.974 --> 16:42.743
or intense screaming.

16:42.776 --> 16:43.844
Was that your statement?

16:43.877 --> 16:45.011
Yes, it was.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.079
And it's true?

16:46.112 --> 16:47.413
Yes, it is.

16:47.447 --> 16:49.683
Well, on the night
of Mr. Neilson's death,

16:49.716 --> 16:52.318
you neither intervened
nor called the police

16:52.352 --> 16:53.720
prior to the shooting,

16:53.754 --> 16:55.589
is that correct?
Yes.

16:55.622 --> 16:57.558
KUPCHECK: So one
could conclude, then,

16:57.591 --> 16:59.492
that there were no sounds
of fighting

16:59.526 --> 17:00.667
before the gun was fired.

17:03.303 --> 17:04.069
I don't know.

17:04.104 --> 17:05.506
Well, you didn't hear them.

17:06.138 --> 17:07.574
I can't say that I did,

17:07.608 --> 17:08.909
but I was in shock myself.

17:08.942 --> 17:10.844
It's possible
I just don't remember.

17:16.249 --> 17:17.183
DOLE: Ellenor,

17:17.217 --> 17:18.483
Hi.

17:18.519 --> 17:19.452
Hey.

17:24.991 --> 17:26.192
Looks like somebody's leaving.

17:29.229 --> 17:30.897
Lindsay, this is none
of my business.

17:32.098 --> 17:34.400
I couldn't agree
with you more.

17:34.434 --> 17:35.335
FRUTT: All right, look,

17:36.937 --> 17:37.871
cards on the table?

17:40.406 --> 17:42.042
I love you,

17:42.075 --> 17:44.077
and I love Bobby,

17:44.110 --> 17:46.246
and I suppose I have
an emotional investment

17:46.279 --> 17:48.749
in this marriage.

17:48.782 --> 17:50.316
I think you're being far,

17:50.350 --> 17:52.052
far too draconian here.

17:53.319 --> 17:55.522
You have a son,

17:55.556 --> 17:57.223
and as angry
as you may be with Bobby,

17:57.257 --> 18:00.100
and I don't blame you,
by the way.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.467
You have to realize

18:01.502 --> 18:04.237
that the hatred you feel
comes from betrayal

18:04.270 --> 18:05.972
and that the foundation
of betrayal

18:06.006 --> 18:06.740
is love.

18:09.643 --> 18:12.879
There is no good reason

18:12.913 --> 18:13.980
to rush this.

18:15.048 --> 18:17.483
Let some time pass.

18:17.518 --> 18:19.953
Give your emotions
some time to settle.

18:21.722 --> 18:23.857
Lindsay,

18:23.890 --> 18:25.826
you have a son.

18:27.493 --> 18:28.829
Can you sit for a second?

18:38.238 --> 18:41.074
Last week,
I sat in a church grieving

18:41.107 --> 18:42.408
for a serial killer,

18:44.010 --> 18:47.380
a sick man who kills
innocent people.

18:47.413 --> 18:49.583
I mourned his loss, Ellenor.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.420
But the thing that struck me
sitting in that church

18:54.454 --> 18:56.022
was that I was mourning.

18:57.824 --> 18:58.725
I was feeling.

18:59.993 --> 19:03.303
It was something
I haven't done for a long,

19:03.336 --> 19:04.237
long time.

19:07.173 --> 19:08.909
And you said
let my emotions settle.

19:11.144 --> 19:12.412
My problem is...

19:13.580 --> 19:14.915
I've had no emotions.

19:16.883 --> 19:18.418
I've been going dead
with Bobby.

19:20.020 --> 19:23.256
With every day,
I grow a little more dead,

19:23.289 --> 19:25.959
and that's where my son
is becoming most victimized.

19:28.128 --> 19:30.597
His mother is becoming
emotionally deadened.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.503
I wish I would feel hatred

19:36.537 --> 19:38.104
or anger towards Bobby,

19:39.640 --> 19:40.741
but I feel neither.

19:44.310 --> 19:45.912
I don't love him.

19:45.946 --> 19:46.980
I don't hate him.

19:48.582 --> 19:50.350
I'm not sure
if I really even like him,

19:51.685 --> 19:53.153
but what I am sure of

19:53.186 --> 19:56.690
is that for me
to have any chance

19:56.723 --> 19:59.125
of resuming
some emotional life,

20:01.067 --> 20:02.736
I have to get away
from him.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.607
And that's what I'm doing.

20:15.115 --> 20:17.383
YOUNG: I'm not so convinced
we should call her.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.351
STRINGER: Carrie?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.086
How can we not?

20:20.120 --> 20:22.188
Well, the neighbor's
testimony went so well,

20:22.222 --> 20:23.489
Carrie could just throw
that all away.

20:23.524 --> 20:26.326
But our whole case turns
on jury sympathy.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.828
They have to get to know her.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.863
Maybe so.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.470
Eugene, can we talk

20:37.504 --> 20:38.739
for a second about last week

20:38.772 --> 20:39.706
when I took the stand?

20:39.740 --> 20:41.107
What's there to talk about?

20:41.141 --> 20:44.277
Look, I know you weren't
trying to do me any favors,

20:44.310 --> 20:45.011
but why--

20:49.082 --> 20:51.618
is there a reason
you feel a need to apologize

20:51.652 --> 20:53.554
if somebody salutes
your compassion?

20:54.721 --> 20:55.856
I don't think I do that.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.602
Why do you grunt?

21:02.368 --> 21:03.369
I beg your pardon?

21:03.403 --> 21:05.305
Well, do you intimidate people
by design?

21:05.338 --> 21:08.374
Look, we have a case
to work on here, Jamie,

21:08.408 --> 21:10.544
so is there a reason
for all these questions?

21:10.577 --> 21:11.745
I'm just taking a personal
interest in you.

21:11.778 --> 21:12.478
That's all.

21:18.585 --> 21:19.586
Look,

21:20.821 --> 21:23.323
I know you wouldn't go out
with me in a million years,

21:23.356 --> 21:25.826
but I was wondering

21:27.027 --> 21:28.194
after this trial,

21:30.531 --> 21:32.232
could we may be set our clock

21:32.265 --> 21:34.601
ahead a million years
and go have dinner?

21:34.635 --> 21:37.571
(music playing)

21:41.508 --> 21:43.343
I don't think that would be
a great idea.

21:46.246 --> 21:46.980
Okay.

21:49.883 --> 21:50.851
Can we debate the merit

21:50.884 --> 21:52.285
of the idea over dinner?

21:58.759 --> 22:00.166
Let's just get back to work.

22:03.737 --> 22:04.671
Fine.

22:07.207 --> 22:08.141
Fine.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.427
I've scheduled
a settlement conference

22:27.460 --> 22:30.030
for 9:00 tomorrow morning.

22:30.063 --> 22:31.164
As I said,
I'd be thrilled to get 50

22:31.197 --> 22:32.933
under this fact pattern.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.835
Okay.

22:38.038 --> 22:39.706
May I ask,

22:39.740 --> 22:41.508
who was handling this case,

22:41.542 --> 22:42.976
you or Lindsay?

22:43.544 --> 22:46.179
Well, I was pushing it uphill.

22:46.212 --> 22:48.782
Um, Lindsay was planning
to take the depos.

22:49.550 --> 22:51.351
Why?

22:51.384 --> 22:52.586
Can I be honest?

22:52.619 --> 22:54.087
Sure.

22:55.321 --> 22:56.857
I think a disservice

22:56.890 --> 22:59.192
was done to these people,

22:59.225 --> 23:00.734
revving the mother up,

23:00.767 --> 23:03.103
making her think
there'd be some big score.

23:03.136 --> 23:04.938
CLAIRE: Her daughter
is in a wheelchair.

23:04.971 --> 23:06.707
We hardly needed
to rev her up.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.809
She was obviously led
to believe

23:08.842 --> 23:10.210
there's some pot of gold here.

23:10.243 --> 23:12.445
There should be.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.980
A girl is disabled--
BERLUTI: Yes,

23:14.014 --> 23:15.782
the damages are there.

23:15.816 --> 23:18.084
That doesn't mean
liability is.

23:18.118 --> 23:19.720
Whose side are you on?

23:21.888 --> 23:25.091
Claire, I know you don't
wanna hear this,

23:25.125 --> 23:27.528
but public housing tenants

23:27.561 --> 23:29.162
make lousy plaintiffs.

23:29.830 --> 23:30.997
For whatever reason,

23:31.031 --> 23:33.133
juries don't like them.

23:33.166 --> 23:34.300
On top of that,

23:34.334 --> 23:36.770
you've got a defendant
knee-deep in HUD loans

23:36.803 --> 23:39.405
just trying to keep
the place habitable.

23:39.439 --> 23:40.774
There's no pot of gold,

23:40.807 --> 23:42.643
and you did a big disservice

23:42.676 --> 23:44.911
to the client
to suggest otherwise.

23:46.279 --> 23:49.215
I know you're young
and enthusiastic,

23:49.249 --> 23:51.685
but I think you need to deal

23:51.718 --> 23:53.654
with your zeal.

23:53.687 --> 23:55.722
Sometimes it can cause harm.

24:00.967 --> 24:02.536
The meeting's at 9:00.

24:09.175 --> 24:11.411
CARRIE: We'd been married
just under four years.

24:11.444 --> 24:12.412
Happily?

24:12.445 --> 24:13.947
CARRIE: Till about
two years ago.

24:13.980 --> 24:17.383
He was having problems
with his partners,

24:17.417 --> 24:19.686
and he started drinking more.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.487
He started hitting me.

24:22.088 --> 24:23.657
STRINGER:
He started hitting you.

24:23.690 --> 24:25.559
Over what period of time?

24:26.059 --> 24:28.361
Over a period
of about six months.

24:29.429 --> 24:30.631
Then I got pregnant,

24:30.664 --> 24:33.499
and he promised
to stop drinking.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.901
Did he?

24:35.902 --> 24:37.871
For a while.

24:37.904 --> 24:40.006
Things kept getting worse
at work.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.975
I couldn't have been easy
to be around,

24:42.008 --> 24:43.376
you know, the first trimester

24:43.409 --> 24:44.745
of my first pregnancy.

24:45.245 --> 24:47.113
Can you tell us
what happened that night?

24:48.148 --> 24:49.115
He came home.

24:51.417 --> 24:52.919
He'd been drinking.

24:53.987 --> 24:55.589
And he said--

24:56.990 --> 24:59.225
he said he didn't want me

24:59.259 --> 25:01.768
and he didn't want the baby,

25:01.802 --> 25:03.269
that he was suffocating,

25:03.303 --> 25:04.905
that I'd ruined everything.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.472
STRINGER: Did you argue?

25:06.507 --> 25:08.742
CARRIE: Not really.

25:08.775 --> 25:12.045
I began to respond
when he just shoved me,

25:12.078 --> 25:13.747
and then he punched me.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.748
What did you do?

25:14.781 --> 25:17.450
I did what I always did.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.019
I took it,

25:19.052 --> 25:21.722
tried not to make him
any more angry.

25:21.755 --> 25:24.057
STRINGER: How did he react
to that?

25:24.090 --> 25:26.593
He said something about

25:26.627 --> 25:28.562
getting it out of me,

25:28.595 --> 25:31.497
and then he punched me,

25:31.532 --> 25:33.466
and I fell to the ground.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.367
STRINGER: Then what?

25:34.968 --> 25:37.070
And I pulled...

25:37.103 --> 25:38.238
the gun out of the cabinet

25:38.271 --> 25:39.172
where we kept it,

25:39.205 --> 25:41.708
and I told him to stand back,

25:41.742 --> 25:44.344
that I wouldn't let him hurt
our baby,

25:44.377 --> 25:46.379
and then he lunged at me!

25:47.447 --> 25:49.115
Carrie, what did you do next?

25:49.850 --> 25:50.917
I shot him.

25:54.788 --> 25:56.489
It was as if my fingers,

25:56.523 --> 25:58.625
they just convulsed
on the trigger

25:58.659 --> 26:02.102
like it wasn't me shooting.

26:04.738 --> 26:05.906
KUPCHECK: You say
your husband beat you

26:05.939 --> 26:07.708
over a six-month period

26:07.741 --> 26:08.909
and you never called the police

26:08.942 --> 26:10.611
any of those times.

26:10.644 --> 26:12.779
I'm seeing a therapist
about that now

26:12.813 --> 26:14.114
and she says it's called

26:14.147 --> 26:15.716
battered women syndrome.

26:15.749 --> 26:16.517
KUPCHECK: I see.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.552
Did you ever go to the hospital?

26:18.585 --> 26:19.586
No.
So you were never

26:19.620 --> 26:20.554
really injured.

26:20.587 --> 26:21.888
CARRIE: Oh, I had bruises.

26:21.922 --> 26:23.590
I was just too ashamed to--

26:23.624 --> 26:25.391
You never went
to a shelter either?

26:26.259 --> 26:28.028
No.
With all these places

26:28.061 --> 26:30.263
you could go to for help--
Knowing something's there

26:30.296 --> 26:31.965
and being able to do
something about it

26:31.998 --> 26:33.266
are two different--
But you did do

26:33.299 --> 26:35.068
something about it,
didn't you, Carrie?

26:35.101 --> 26:36.937
You decided to put six bullets

26:36.970 --> 26:39.105
into your husband rather--
Objection!

26:39.139 --> 26:40.306
Sustained.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.374
Does the name Robert Sheehan

26:41.407 --> 26:42.275
mean anything to you?

26:44.845 --> 26:45.812
He's a lawyer.

26:45.846 --> 26:47.881
He's a divorce lawyer
you consulted

26:47.914 --> 26:49.049
only one month

26:49.082 --> 26:50.283
before you killed your husband.

26:52.252 --> 26:53.253
CARRIE: I met with him once,

26:53.286 --> 26:55.856
but I didn't follow
through on it.

26:55.889 --> 26:57.323
Because he told you
that since most

26:57.357 --> 26:58.458
of your husband's money

26:58.491 --> 26:59.760
was held in trusts,

26:59.793 --> 27:01.501
you would get a lot more
with him dead

27:01.535 --> 27:02.335
than if you divorced him.

27:02.368 --> 27:03.336
Objection!

27:03.369 --> 27:04.404
Sustained.

27:05.005 --> 27:06.272
Your husband have life
insurance?

27:06.306 --> 27:07.440
Yes.

27:07.473 --> 27:10.010
It's a $500,000 policy

27:10.043 --> 27:11.377
with the money going to you.

27:11.411 --> 27:13.279
You're aware of that,
aren't you?

27:13.313 --> 27:14.347
I'm aware of it.

27:14.380 --> 27:17.083
You decided to trade in
your alcoholic husband

27:17.117 --> 27:19.185
for half a million dollars,
didn't you, Mrs. Neilson?

27:19.219 --> 27:22.656
I decided to save the life
of my baby, Mr. Kupcheck.

27:22.689 --> 27:24.290
Oh, you were saving your baby?

27:24.324 --> 27:25.491
Yes.

27:25.526 --> 27:27.360
Not your own life,

27:27.393 --> 27:28.261
but your baby's.

27:28.895 --> 27:29.930
Yes.

27:30.764 --> 27:32.065
Mrs. Neilson,

27:32.098 --> 27:33.299
have you ever had an abortion?

27:33.333 --> 27:34.134
Objection!
Objection!

27:34.167 --> 27:36.069
The defendant
is clearly saying

27:36.102 --> 27:37.938
that a two-month fetus
is a person.

27:37.971 --> 27:39.372
I'd like to cross-examine her
on that.

27:39.405 --> 27:40.373
I'll allow it.

27:41.875 --> 27:43.409
Have you ever had an abortion?

27:45.612 --> 27:46.847
Once,

27:46.880 --> 27:48.314
before I was married.

27:49.082 --> 27:51.585
If you remember,

27:51.618 --> 27:53.654
how old was the child?

27:56.890 --> 27:58.258
Seventeen weeks.

28:03.804 --> 28:05.371
YOUNG: We got hurt
in there today, Jamie.

28:05.405 --> 28:06.707
STRINGER: Many people change
their positions

28:06.740 --> 28:07.808
on abortion, Eugene,

28:07.841 --> 28:09.375
especially after they
get married.

28:09.409 --> 28:10.844
We need to draft a proposed set

28:10.877 --> 28:12.478
of jury instructions.
Mr. Young,

28:12.513 --> 28:14.047
you called for me.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.682
I need for you to think,
Mr. Gaul.

28:15.716 --> 28:16.983
Think back.

28:17.017 --> 28:18.184
Are you sure you didn't hear

28:18.218 --> 28:19.452
anything before the shots?

28:20.086 --> 28:21.121
I'm not sure at all.

28:21.154 --> 28:23.023
He put those words
into my mouth.

28:23.056 --> 28:24.925
I may very well
have heard them fighting.

28:24.958 --> 28:25.826
I may need to put you

28:25.859 --> 28:26.893
back up there to say that.

28:27.327 --> 28:27.961
Okay.

28:27.994 --> 28:29.129
I'll let you know.

28:31.364 --> 28:32.533
It is not a good idea.

28:32.566 --> 28:33.834
We cannot rest our case

28:33.867 --> 28:35.869
on that kind of uncertainty.
Well, I don't like resting

28:35.902 --> 28:37.003
our case where we are right now.

28:37.037 --> 28:38.104
Look, you wanna put
the neighbor up there

28:38.138 --> 28:39.506
to say what he may have heard?

28:39.540 --> 28:40.707
Jury instructions, Jamie.

28:40.741 --> 28:42.142
I need them on my desk tonight.

28:42.175 --> 28:43.376
Fine.
Fine.

28:45.278 --> 28:46.713
MAN (over TV):
Where is everybody?

28:46.747 --> 28:49.182
Come on, guys. We're gonna--
It just seems like

28:49.215 --> 28:50.651
such a little amount.

28:50.684 --> 28:53.554
It is, but--
NAOMI: I read in the papers,

28:53.587 --> 28:56.156
these people
who choose to smoke

28:56.189 --> 28:57.357
win millions of dollars

28:57.390 --> 28:59.492
from the tobacco companies.

28:59.526 --> 29:01.334
My daughter didn't choose

29:01.367 --> 29:03.637
to lean against
a broken railing,

29:03.670 --> 29:05.772
and now she can't walk.

29:05.806 --> 29:08.542
CLAIRE: I think one thing
that they're betting on

29:08.575 --> 29:09.610
is that you can't afford

29:09.643 --> 29:11.211
to see this through trial.

29:11.244 --> 29:12.979
If you beat them in court,
Ms. Carter,

29:13.013 --> 29:14.881
it could take four
or five years

29:14.915 --> 29:16.583
before you get anything,

29:16.617 --> 29:18.218
that's just assuming you win,

29:18.251 --> 29:19.119
which...

29:20.253 --> 29:21.354
isn't even likely.

29:23.957 --> 29:26.226
There's nothing else you can do?

29:27.628 --> 29:29.095
I don't think so.

29:29.129 --> 29:30.330
I mean, the truth is

29:30.363 --> 29:32.032
you've got a sympathetic
defendant

29:32.065 --> 29:34.500
providing housing
with loans from HUD.

29:34.535 --> 29:35.435
Like Jimmy says,

29:35.468 --> 29:37.203
they get these loans just to--

29:38.471 --> 29:39.405
NAOMI: What?

29:41.341 --> 29:42.142
What?

29:45.846 --> 29:46.913
What do you mean redo them?

29:46.947 --> 29:48.414
Redo them.
They're imprecise.

29:48.448 --> 29:49.550
This whole case
would come down--

29:49.583 --> 29:50.817
Where are they imprecise?

29:53.820 --> 29:56.456
Three, four, five, six.

29:56.489 --> 29:58.158
We need to spell it out.

29:58.191 --> 30:00.026
It is.
Not enough, Jamie.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.167
If that judge instructs

30:01.201 --> 30:02.936
that a fetus is not a child,

30:02.969 --> 30:03.737
we lose.

30:03.770 --> 30:04.771
Do you get that?

30:04.805 --> 30:07.173
Our whole theory
is defense of others.

30:07.207 --> 30:08.408
If she instructs

30:08.441 --> 30:09.743
that there is no child,

30:09.776 --> 30:10.777
then there is no other.

30:10.811 --> 30:12.979
Stop talking to me
like I'm three.

30:13.013 --> 30:14.748
I'm talking to you
like you're a lawyer

30:14.781 --> 30:17.017
and this work
is not acceptable.

30:17.050 --> 30:18.251
Oh, you're full of crap!

30:18.284 --> 30:19.886
You're upset because
I asked you to dinner

30:19.920 --> 30:21.187
and you can't handle it.

30:21.221 --> 30:22.923
Well, the offer is revoked.

30:22.956 --> 30:24.991
You can go eat
a cheeseburger alone

30:25.025 --> 30:27.060
like the big,
bald curmudgeon you are.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.095
You don't talk to me like that.
These instructions are fine.

30:29.129 --> 30:30.731
The work is acceptable.

30:30.764 --> 30:32.398
So you can go off
into a corner and grunt.

30:32.432 --> 30:33.800
Oh, now I get it.

30:33.834 --> 30:37.337
Get what?
You asked me out for currency.

30:37.370 --> 30:39.105
Now, when I come down on you
for your work,

30:39.139 --> 30:41.975
you can claim I'm retaliating
for personal reasons.

30:42.008 --> 30:42.843
Very clever!
STRINGER: Oh,

30:42.876 --> 30:44.210
that is so cynical!

30:44.244 --> 30:45.879
I don't think so.
STRINGER: I asked you out

30:45.912 --> 30:47.514
because I like you

30:47.548 --> 30:48.849
and you can't take it.

30:48.882 --> 30:50.216
Well, I like you.

30:52.553 --> 30:53.854
I like you.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.339
(door opens)

31:08.174 --> 31:08.842
Claire?

31:12.278 --> 31:13.479
Claire?

31:15.448 --> 31:16.449
Did you sleep here?

31:17.584 --> 31:19.920
Oh, I guess I did.

31:19.953 --> 31:21.321
What are you working on?

31:21.354 --> 31:22.088
CLAIRE: The Carter case.

31:22.122 --> 31:23.757
I have a 9:00

31:23.790 --> 31:24.691
settlement conference.

31:24.725 --> 31:26.092
It's 10 past 9:00.

31:26.126 --> 31:27.293
What?

31:30.196 --> 31:31.264
I'm so sorry.

31:31.297 --> 31:32.032
Traffic.

31:32.065 --> 31:33.767
We just started.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.968
Mr. Sloan is offering us

31:35.001 --> 31:38.338
the grand sum of $20,000.
Look,

31:38.371 --> 31:39.506
our insurance company

31:39.540 --> 31:41.341
is tightening up
on nuisance claims.

31:41.374 --> 31:43.143
Nuisance?
Claire,

31:43.176 --> 31:45.345
that girl is disabled for life.

31:45.378 --> 31:47.047
This is hardly a nuisance claim.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.749
Come on.
Post-accident tests

31:48.782 --> 31:49.983
showed a minimal fissure.

31:50.016 --> 31:51.051
The railing broke.

31:51.084 --> 31:52.886
Because she jumped on to it.

31:52.919 --> 31:54.287
She weighs 70 pounds.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.023
SLOAN: Look,
there's no negligence,

31:57.057 --> 31:57.991
and if we go to trial,

31:58.024 --> 31:59.125
you're looking at three years

31:59.159 --> 32:02.168
before the first witness
is even sworn in.

32:02.202 --> 32:03.303
Now, I'm sure your client

32:03.336 --> 32:04.905
could use that 20,000.

32:04.938 --> 32:06.139
My suspicion is it would come in

32:06.172 --> 32:07.541
very handy right now.

32:08.642 --> 32:09.776
You have an obligation

32:09.810 --> 32:11.778
to take the offer
to your client.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.782
Could you take this
to your client?

32:17.851 --> 32:19.485
SLOAN: What is it?
CLAIRE: An amendment

32:19.520 --> 32:21.387
to our document
production request.

32:21.421 --> 32:23.289
We want your HUD
financial records.

32:23.957 --> 32:25.391
I already got
the loan application

32:25.425 --> 32:28.662
under the Freedom
of Information Act.

32:28.695 --> 32:30.564
Your client made representations

32:30.597 --> 32:32.398
about upgrading and renovating

32:32.432 --> 32:33.734
White Oaks Property.

32:33.767 --> 32:36.002
They got $4,000,000 in fact,

32:36.036 --> 32:37.571
which is interesting because

32:37.604 --> 32:40.707
according to your own
interrogatory responses,

32:40.741 --> 32:42.208
there have been no renovations

32:42.242 --> 32:44.645
since you received
the HUD funding.

32:44.678 --> 32:45.946
You stated that there
are currently

32:45.979 --> 32:48.682
no plans for remodeling.

32:48.715 --> 32:50.083
That might qualify your client

32:50.116 --> 32:52.719
for fraud, Mr. Sloan.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.621
I think you're reaching,
counsel.

32:54.655 --> 32:55.589
CLAIRE: I don't think so.

32:56.089 --> 32:58.725
You received money earmarked
for repairs.

32:58.759 --> 33:00.433
Had you done those repairs,

33:00.466 --> 33:02.769
the faulty railing
would have been discovered.

33:02.803 --> 33:05.238
If you've not done them,

33:05.271 --> 33:06.540
brings me back to fraud.

33:06.573 --> 33:08.642
SLOAN: You don't know
what that money was spent on.

33:08.675 --> 33:10.744
Now, I don't think--
This is my motion

33:10.777 --> 33:12.613
for a court-enforced audit.

33:12.646 --> 33:15.015
Then we'll know what the money
was spent on

33:15.048 --> 33:16.349
or not spent on.

33:16.382 --> 33:18.819
I certainly hope your client

33:18.852 --> 33:21.187
didn't take a low road,
Mr. Sloan.

33:21.221 --> 33:22.455
There's still an opportunity

33:22.488 --> 33:24.224
to choose a high one.

33:24.257 --> 33:25.726
I would encourage you

33:25.759 --> 33:27.327
to encourage your client

33:27.360 --> 33:28.361
to reconsider,

33:29.162 --> 33:31.031
not to avoid an audit,

33:31.064 --> 33:34.100
not to avoid liability
for fraud,

33:34.134 --> 33:36.336
but to compensate
a 10-year-old girl

33:36.369 --> 33:38.238
who will never be a cheerleader,

33:38.271 --> 33:39.439
who will never get to dance

33:39.472 --> 33:41.107
at her senior prom,

33:41.141 --> 33:42.509
and who won't walk down
the aisle

33:42.543 --> 33:43.677
at her own wedding.

33:45.078 --> 33:47.047
She won't walk through many
of life's moments

33:47.080 --> 33:49.716
because I suspect
your client got greedy.

33:50.917 --> 33:53.019
I would encourage you
to talk to your client

33:53.053 --> 33:54.821
because it's the right thing
to do.

34:00.767 --> 34:02.669
This was murder.

34:03.837 --> 34:05.271
A woman in a lousy marriage

34:05.305 --> 34:08.074
fires six shots point-blank.

34:08.108 --> 34:10.476
Bang! Bang! Bang!

34:10.511 --> 34:12.646
Bang! Bang! Bang!

34:12.679 --> 34:14.514
That's not defense.

34:16.216 --> 34:17.283
No evidence

34:17.317 --> 34:18.719
of any shouting or fighting

34:18.752 --> 34:20.654
preceding the shooting.

34:20.687 --> 34:21.655
It just so happens

34:21.688 --> 34:22.656
the defendant visited

34:22.688 --> 34:23.724
a divorce attorney

34:23.757 --> 34:25.458
one month before.

34:25.491 --> 34:27.994
She explored getting out
of this marriage one way,

34:28.661 --> 34:29.862
she chose another.

34:30.797 --> 34:32.132
And as for this theory,

34:32.165 --> 34:33.667
she was defending the life

34:33.699 --> 34:34.868
of her unborn child.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.771
This fetus was eight weeks old.

34:37.804 --> 34:40.607
She previously aborted
a 17-week fetus.

34:40.641 --> 34:42.242
So let's not pretend

34:42.275 --> 34:43.810
that she considered it a person,

34:43.844 --> 34:45.746
and even if she did,

34:45.779 --> 34:47.246
the law doesn't.

34:48.248 --> 34:50.917
A nonviable fetus
is not a person.

34:50.951 --> 34:52.819
That's what the Supreme Court
has said.

34:52.853 --> 34:54.454
Now, she wants to say, "Hey,

34:54.487 --> 34:56.089
as far as she's concerned,

34:56.121 --> 34:56.956
it's a human being."

34:56.989 --> 34:59.560
Well, that is exactly
the rationale

34:59.593 --> 35:01.768
employed by people
who shoot doctors

35:01.802 --> 35:02.869
at abortion clinics.

35:03.737 --> 35:04.805
They're just protecting

35:04.838 --> 35:06.406
the lives of the unborn.

35:06.439 --> 35:08.241
Well, we don't let
those murderers

35:08.274 --> 35:09.309
get away with it,

35:09.342 --> 35:11.144
and we can't let this one.

35:12.813 --> 35:13.780
And finally...

35:15.315 --> 35:17.283
even should you choose

35:17.317 --> 35:18.819
to ignore the law,

35:18.852 --> 35:20.120
defy the Supreme Court,

35:20.153 --> 35:22.388
and find this fetus
to be a person,

35:22.422 --> 35:24.558
thereby affording
Mrs. Neilson

35:24.591 --> 35:26.793
her novel defense,

35:26.827 --> 35:28.394
her use of force

35:28.428 --> 35:30.230
has to be reasonable.

35:30.797 --> 35:33.266
It cannot be excessive.

35:34.067 --> 35:36.903
The victim here was unarmed.

35:36.937 --> 35:39.139
One shot was arguably excessive.

35:39.172 --> 35:40.907
She fired six,

35:41.608 --> 35:44.177
five after he lay on the floor.

35:46.112 --> 35:47.748
You see this man here?

35:48.549 --> 35:50.283
He was very much a person.

35:51.117 --> 35:53.720
This was a human being

35:55.021 --> 35:57.758
shot six times,

35:57.791 --> 35:59.159
point blank.

36:03.103 --> 36:04.738
She fired the one shot

36:04.771 --> 36:06.873
and impulsively kept squeezing.

36:06.907 --> 36:08.542
In her own testimony,

36:08.575 --> 36:11.077
she said her fingers convulsed
on the trigger.

36:11.111 --> 36:14.214
That testimony was not refuted.

36:14.247 --> 36:16.382
As for her consulting
with a divorce lawyer,

36:16.416 --> 36:17.684
that didn't just so happen.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.886
Of course,
she thought about divorce.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.021
The man was beating her,

36:21.054 --> 36:22.155
punching her in the stomach.

36:22.188 --> 36:23.223
She was pregnant,

36:23.256 --> 36:24.825
and talk to any pregnant woman.

36:24.858 --> 36:27.694
They don't point to their
stomach and say "the thing"

36:27.728 --> 36:28.795
or "the fetus."

36:29.462 --> 36:31.264
They call it "the baby"

36:31.297 --> 36:33.066
so don't tell me that
for any woman

36:33.099 --> 36:34.100
who's been pregnant

36:34.134 --> 36:36.036
that there isn't a life in play.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.270
This country

36:37.303 --> 36:39.606
spends millions of dollars
educating people

36:39.640 --> 36:41.808
on the importance
of prenatal care

36:41.842 --> 36:44.778
because we recognize that life,

36:44.811 --> 36:47.447
because parenting starts
with pregnancy,

36:47.480 --> 36:49.415
because the essence
of parenting

36:49.449 --> 36:50.817
is protecting the child,

36:50.851 --> 36:52.686
and that starts in the womb.

36:53.219 --> 36:55.421
She didn't have to consult
with the Supreme Court

36:55.455 --> 36:58.058
to know that she had a child
living inside her.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.626
Carrie Neilson

36:59.660 --> 37:01.801
was protecting her child

37:02.902 --> 37:04.538
and in case you didn't know,

37:04.571 --> 37:05.872
if the victim

37:05.905 --> 37:07.741
had killed that child

37:07.774 --> 37:08.808
with one of his punches,

37:08.842 --> 37:10.944
the state legally could

37:10.977 --> 37:12.712
and would have charged him
with murder.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.683
See, we prosecute those
who kill nonviable fetuses

37:16.716 --> 37:18.985
unless it's by a legal abortion.

37:19.018 --> 37:20.654
So it's disingenuous

37:20.687 --> 37:22.055
for the state
to be saying to you,

37:22.088 --> 37:24.457
"Hey, there is no life."

37:27.528 --> 37:29.195
There was a life

37:29.996 --> 37:32.065
and my client did
what she had to,

37:32.098 --> 37:33.133
to save it.

37:43.510 --> 37:44.811
KITTLESON: Okay,

37:44.845 --> 37:45.979
members of the jury,

37:46.012 --> 37:48.682
I am now going to give you
a set of instructions

37:48.715 --> 37:50.483
before I send you back
to deliberate.

37:51.151 --> 37:52.485
The most important one,

37:52.519 --> 37:54.688
I'm going to say first and last

37:54.721 --> 37:57.157
because you really need
to heed it.

37:58.859 --> 38:01.635
For the purpose of this trial,

38:01.668 --> 38:03.303
you are to consider

38:03.336 --> 38:06.339
the fetus a human being.

38:06.372 --> 38:08.742
That means the defendant
is entitled

38:08.775 --> 38:11.344
to use force to defend it.

38:14.047 --> 38:15.616
That was good, right?

38:15.649 --> 38:17.417
That's the exact
instruction we wanted.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.384
YOUNG: But they still
have to find

38:18.418 --> 38:19.786
the force was reasonable,

38:19.820 --> 38:21.287
and six shots is six shots.

38:21.321 --> 38:23.389
They also might not be convinced
on your motive.

38:23.423 --> 38:24.758
Well, how long
before--ah!

38:25.458 --> 38:26.727
You okay?

38:26.760 --> 38:29.563
I was contracting
all through the closings.

38:29.596 --> 38:30.631
I could be in labor.

38:30.664 --> 38:33.033
Well, let's get you
to a hospital then.

38:33.066 --> 38:34.167
Don't I have to be here?

38:34.200 --> 38:35.501
No, not for the reading
of the verdict.

38:35.536 --> 38:36.369
Carrie, why take the risk?

38:36.402 --> 38:37.303
Okay.

38:40.306 --> 38:41.341
YOUNG: Guard?

38:42.609 --> 38:44.044
How much more?

38:44.077 --> 38:45.045
We don't know.

38:45.078 --> 38:46.680
Mr. Sloan says it's a package

38:46.713 --> 38:47.981
we'll be happy with.

38:48.014 --> 38:49.750
So it sounds encouraging.

38:49.783 --> 38:51.852
So this is good news.

38:51.885 --> 38:53.386
BERLUTI: It's very good news.

38:53.419 --> 38:55.255
We gave them two days.

38:55.288 --> 38:57.323
We'll let you know as soon
as the offer comes in.

38:57.991 --> 38:58.992
Okay.

38:59.926 --> 39:01.067
Thank you.

39:01.968 --> 39:03.436
Thank you very much.

39:06.139 --> 39:07.541
I'm gonna go tell Virginia.

39:07.574 --> 39:08.742
Okay.

39:18.251 --> 39:19.820
Wow, huh?

39:19.853 --> 39:22.288
I didn't appreciate you
springing that stuff

39:22.322 --> 39:23.824
in the conference.

39:23.857 --> 39:25.526
I didn't plan that.

39:25.559 --> 39:26.893
I meant to tell you before,

39:26.927 --> 39:28.629
but I overslept,

39:28.662 --> 39:30.531
and then things looked like
they were going south.

39:30.564 --> 39:31.698
You don't need to apologize.

39:34.868 --> 39:36.269
Good work, Claire.

39:37.270 --> 39:38.839
The idea of going to HUD,

39:38.872 --> 39:40.707
the legwork,

39:40.741 --> 39:43.443
getting ahold
of those documents

39:43.476 --> 39:44.410
that was something.

39:46.513 --> 39:47.714
It's called zeal.

39:49.916 --> 39:51.952
You're a fine, young lawyer,

39:51.985 --> 39:55.421
and, well, excellent job.

39:56.923 --> 39:57.858
Thank you.

40:04.004 --> 40:05.271
(door closes)

40:13.213 --> 40:14.515
How long ago?

40:14.548 --> 40:16.016
Jamie--

40:16.049 --> 40:16.983
Thank you very much.

40:19.219 --> 40:21.121
She's in full labor.

40:21.154 --> 40:22.155
KITTLESON: Members of the jury,

40:22.188 --> 40:23.223
have you reached a verdict?

40:24.290 --> 40:25.225
We have, Your Honor.

40:26.026 --> 40:27.360
KITTLESON: What say you?

40:27.393 --> 40:28.762
FOREPERSON: On the matter
of the Commonwealth

40:28.795 --> 40:30.063
versus Carrie Neilson

40:30.096 --> 40:32.465
on the charge of murder
in the first-degree,

40:32.498 --> 40:34.134
we find the defendant,

40:34.167 --> 40:35.602
not guilty.

40:35.636 --> 40:37.971
On the charge of murder
in the second-degree,

40:38.004 --> 40:39.506
we find the defendant,

40:40.040 --> 40:40.874
not guilty.

40:42.175 --> 40:43.877
KITTLESON: This concludes
the jury's service.

40:43.910 --> 40:46.412
You are dismissed
with the court's thanks.

40:46.446 --> 40:47.814
We are adjourned.

40:47.848 --> 40:49.816
(gavel bangs)

40:56.523 --> 40:57.858
Congratulations.

41:01.134 --> 41:02.202
You too.

41:03.737 --> 41:04.838
Let's go tell Carrie.

41:15.816 --> 41:17.283
Seven pounds, ten ounces.

41:17.317 --> 41:18.418
Everybody's healthy?

41:18.451 --> 41:19.986
NURSE: Mother and son
are doing fine.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.287
The doctor will be out
in a second

41:21.321 --> 41:22.556
and she said you could go in.

41:22.589 --> 41:24.157
You told her she was acquitted?

41:24.190 --> 41:25.826
NURSE: I did. She's ecstatic.

41:25.859 --> 41:26.927
It'll just be a second.

41:28.995 --> 41:30.897
Good day, I guess.
Yup.

41:30.931 --> 41:33.567
WOMAN (over PA): Dr. Cullen,
to go to medicine.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.135
I loved your closing,
by the way.

41:36.002 --> 41:36.937
Thank you.

41:39.072 --> 41:40.440
Listen,

41:41.141 --> 41:43.844
if you still feel
like getting dinner

41:43.877 --> 41:45.646
sometime later--

41:47.914 --> 41:49.349
That'd be great.

41:50.784 --> 41:52.285
Okay.

41:53.286 --> 41:54.420
(door opens)

41:56.189 --> 41:58.024
You can go in.
YOUNG: Thank you.

41:58.058 --> 42:01.334
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Minder, call pediatric.

42:02.636 --> 42:05.506
(music playing)

42:09.075 --> 42:11.011
(giggles)

42:24.891 --> 42:26.459
Now I see
why she wanted the trial

42:26.492 --> 42:27.928
before she delivered.

42:30.597 --> 42:32.566
(music playing)

42:36.803 --> 42:38.705
It might not mean anything.

42:39.806 --> 42:41.274
Nope.

42:41.307 --> 42:42.242
Might not.

42:53.386 --> 42:56.389
(music playing)

43:19.485 --> 43:20.687
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:20.921 --> 43:23.824
(music playing)
