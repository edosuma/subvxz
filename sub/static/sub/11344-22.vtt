(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.436 --> 00:05.706
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.242
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.276 --> 00:10.144
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.178 --> 00:11.512
are members
of an elite squad

00:11.545 --> 00:13.514
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.250
These are their stories.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.653
[thumping]
[man]
Come on.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.091
[woman grunting]

00:23.124 --> 00:24.725
[man]
Come on.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.061
[woman]
Ow.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.597
What the hell
is going on in there?
Oh, jeez!

00:29.630 --> 00:32.400
[man]
Let's get out of here!

00:32.433 --> 00:33.701
Wait!

00:34.835 --> 00:36.704
You all right?

00:36.737 --> 00:39.673
[crying]
Help me! Help me!

00:39.707 --> 00:41.675
Did those boys hurt you?

00:41.709 --> 00:43.544
They raped me!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.813
Help me.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.116
Help.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.517
(Benson)
Jamie...

00:49.550 --> 00:51.385
My name is Olivia.
I'm a police officer.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.520
I'm here to help you.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.521
[sobbing]
Okay.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.223
Take a breath,
calm down.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.558
Nobody is gonna
hurt you anymore.

00:57.591 --> 01:02.196
Okay, Jamie, do you recognize
the boys that did this to you?

01:02.230 --> 01:04.598
Okay, I need you
to tell me their names.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.833
Listen, Jamie,
don't be scared.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.801
I know this is hard, okay?

01:07.835 --> 01:10.871
But I promise you I'm gonna
help you get through this.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.406
What are their names?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.175
Danny and Cameron.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.309
Good. Okay.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.610
Thou hast hit it.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.778
Come sit on me.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.248
Asses are made to bear
and so are you.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.616
Women are made to bear,
and so are you.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.852
Danny Morrison,
Cameron Shaw.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.120
Come with us, please.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.255
Can it wait till
after rehearsal?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.489
We open next week.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.858
Show's over.
Is something wrong?

01:30.891 --> 01:33.194
We heard the reviews
for your last performance.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.862
In the boys' room.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.914
I gave her Valium
to calm her down.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.482
Anything on the exam?

02:28.516 --> 02:29.717
Vaginal trauma,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.419
scratches to the breast
and torso.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.753
And copious fluids.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.422
Consistent with
multiple assailants.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.489
Are the parents here?

02:35.523 --> 02:36.857
Flying back from Prague.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.859
Dad's an executive
with the Philharmonic.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.894
Mom's a cellist.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.863
That's a hell of a thing
to come home to.

02:45.333 --> 02:50.304
I was heading into the bathroom
to change for play practice.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.606
And I saw Danny and Cameron
in the hall.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.908
Okay, did you
know these guys?

02:54.942 --> 02:58.446
During the show, we've
hung out a couple times.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.684
So then what happened?

03:03.717 --> 03:07.721
Just as I was heading
into the bathroom...

03:07.755 --> 03:09.423
I felt someone...

03:09.457 --> 03:12.893
grab me from behind.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.297
It was Danny and Cameron.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.700
First I thought
they were joking around, but...

03:19.733 --> 03:22.436
they wouldn't let go.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.306
And they dragged me
into the boys' bathroom.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.307
We were just

03:26.340 --> 03:27.408
having some fun.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.277
You call that
having fun, huh?

03:29.310 --> 03:31.011
Everyone's doing it.
It's no big deal.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.580
It is to Jamie.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.881
No way.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.449
Hooking up
in school's a rush.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.917
She was into it.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.820
They pushed me into a stall.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.556
They pulled me down.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.459
And they pinned my back
to the floor.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.761
Did you scream for help?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.430
I couldn't breathe.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.399
They were both
on top of me.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.700
I felt like I was drowning.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.835
It's not like
anyone got hurt.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.470
It's just for laughs.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.372
Oh...

03:58.406 --> 04:01.309
Was Jamie laughing while
you and Cameron were raping her?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.444
Jamie said we raped her?

04:03.477 --> 04:04.478
She's in the hospital
right now.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.680
Get out.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.681
Me, Danny, and Jamie,

04:07.715 --> 04:09.350
we're all friends.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.651
You got a funny way
of showing it.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.885
(Jamie)
They pulled up my skirt.

04:11.919 --> 04:16.424
And they...

04:16.457 --> 04:19.693
started taking turns.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.430
I was begging them to stop.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.130
But they wouldn't.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.932
They just kept
laughing, like--

04:24.965 --> 04:26.967
Like it was a game.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.569
We scored five points each.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.704
(Stabler)
What kind of scoring
system is that?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.640
You get one point for oral,

04:32.673 --> 04:34.007
two for intercourse,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.843
three for group.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.911
The more public the hookup,
the more points.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.947
So you're saying
she asked to be raped.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.615
Jamie came to us
for the three-way!

04:41.649 --> 04:44.051
She set the time
and the place.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.486
You gotta believe me.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.321
Janitor said you guys
jammed out of there

04:47.355 --> 04:48.522
like your asses
were on fire.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.690
We didn't wanna get busted.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.526
A couple of kids got nailed
for hooking up in the library.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.327
So we took off.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.896
I figured Jamie
was right behind us.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.433
Well, she stayed
in that stall, Danny.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.935
Half naked, crying.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.072
Now, why would she do that
if this was all fun and games?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.840
I don't know.
Hmm.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.009
But Cameron and I
didn't rape her.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.345
Jamie was with us
because she wanted to be.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.980
Take off your clothes.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.549
Why?
Because you're
wearing evidence.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.317
Put these on.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.754
How's Jamie Hoskins?

05:20.788 --> 05:21.655
Sedated.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.957
The physical exam
supports her story.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.560
You talk to the boys?

05:26.594 --> 05:27.761
The boys say
the same thing.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.962
Sex was Jamie's idea,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.631
she told them when
and where to meet her.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.533
They had time to coordinate
their stories.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.567
Yeah, but, uh,

05:33.601 --> 05:35.703
neither of them knew about
the rape accusation

05:35.736 --> 05:36.837
until we put them
in separate rooms.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.506
Or they
pretended not to.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.641
The trauma's real, Captain.
I don't think she's lying.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.042
Well, somebody is.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.644
Captain, this
is Cameron Shaw's father.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.513
Is my boy under arrest?

05:45.546 --> 05:47.581
Not yet.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.082
We're still investigating.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.784
Well, a Detective Tutuola
said, uh,

05:50.818 --> 05:52.920
a girl accused
Cameron of rape.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.688
No, that's not possible.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.457
I mean, he's
a good kid, he--

05:56.490 --> 05:58.091
We have a victim who claims
that your son

05:58.125 --> 05:59.993
forced himself upon her
in the school bathroom.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.028
Look, I work two jobs

06:01.061 --> 06:02.430
to send him to that school.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.398
He's got a scholarship
to Cornell.

06:04.432 --> 06:08.669
He's the first in our family
to go to college.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.704
This could ruin
Cameron's life.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.507
You can see your son now,
Mr. Shaw.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.910
[Cameron]
Dad.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.113
Let's make damn sure
what happened

06:20.147 --> 06:22.716
before we put these boys
in the system.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.657
(woman)
Danny Morrison and Cameron Shaw
are both smart,

06:29.690 --> 06:30.691
motivated students.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.093
Boys made it sound like
it was some kind of game.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.495
Disturbing, but true.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.996
And we've caught kids
in the auditorium,

06:36.029 --> 06:38.031
even in the cafeteria kitchen.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.700
And it's not just the kids.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.569
Two grade school teachers
in Pennsylvania

06:41.602 --> 06:43.170
were caught having sex in
a classroom

06:43.203 --> 06:45.005
while another teacher
guarded the door.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.474
Yeah, we get reports
every week

06:46.507 --> 06:47.841
that a teacher's
having sex with a student.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.577
It's a different world.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.812
Kids are starting younger,
going further.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.614
The parents have no idea
what's happening.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.949
Our senior film class
made a documentary

06:55.983 --> 06:57.585
called The New Hookup.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.019
It's quite an eye-opener.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.621
When I hook up
with a guy,

07:00.654 --> 07:02.155
we'll do everything.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.024
I can't get into
the whole dating thing, though.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.894
(Benson)
I can't believe they're
admitting to stuff on camera.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.596
Trust me, it's no different
from what I hear

07:08.629 --> 07:10.230
in the halls every day.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.832
There's more.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.701
When I'm with a girl,
we usually just mess around

07:13.734 --> 07:14.902
and then play Xbox.

07:14.935 --> 07:15.969
Yeah...it's a great way

07:16.003 --> 07:16.937
to get a bunch
of people together.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.906
Makes it easy to hook up
three-ways and group

07:18.939 --> 07:20.574
while you're waiting
to play.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.642
(first boy)
It's totally casual.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.743
Why go through
all the drama

07:22.776 --> 07:23.777
of dating and breaking up

07:23.811 --> 07:26.046
when you can just
get off and then hang out?
Yes.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.517
Jamie and her best friend
are up next.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.184
Having sex just
'cause everyone else is?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.786
It's pretty gross.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.055
I think everyone's just
really scared of getting hurt.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.657
They'll hook up
with a complete stranger,

07:36.690 --> 07:37.925
just a casual friend,

07:37.958 --> 07:39.927
instead of someone
they really care about.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.531
But...I think it's worth
waiting for love.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.431
(Benson)
That does not sound

07:44.464 --> 07:46.199
like a girl who's looking
for a three-way

07:46.233 --> 07:47.668
in the boys' room.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.902
What's Jamie's
friend's name?

07:48.936 --> 07:49.937
(teacher)
Lesley Sweeny.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.038
She's probably

07:51.071 --> 07:53.173
working in the school
bookstore.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.675
I really don't wanna
talk about it.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.143
You weren't too shy to talk
on that documentary

07:56.176 --> 07:57.645
your classmates made.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.147
But that was different.
These are my friends.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.849
And I don't wanna get them
into any trouble.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.017
Well, Leslie,
they're already in trouble.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.286
Listen, Jamie says
that she was raped.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.889
Cameron and Danny say that she
wanted to have sex with them.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.158
Now, we just need
to find out the truth.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.793
And Dr. Collins says
Jamie's your best friend.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.529
Now, you wanna help her out,
just tell us what you know.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.299
Yesterday, in homeroom...

08:19.332 --> 08:22.302
Jamie told me she decided
to lose her virginity.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.672
Did she fall in love
with someone?

08:24.705 --> 08:25.706
Yeah.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.907
Was it Danny or Cameron?

08:26.940 --> 08:27.908
No.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.142
It was this other guy

08:29.176 --> 08:30.143
in our class.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.745
Trevor Olsen.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.947
She wanted him to be
her first.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.182
But he wasn't interested?
No.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.984
He totally is.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.053
It's just that he has
this policy.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.322
What policy?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.824
I don't do virgins.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.325
It's nothing personal,
I just don't want

08:45.358 --> 08:47.928
the responsibility of planting
the first flag, you know?

08:47.961 --> 08:48.962
Oh, how noble.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.731
Ah, it's self-preservation.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.700
I hooked up with this girl
freshman year.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.834
She was a virgin.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.903
She thought we were gonna
get married or something.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.270
Never again.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.006
Is that why
you wouldn't, uh...

08:59.039 --> 09:01.008
hook up with
Jamie Hoskins?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.776
Jamie's cool.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.778
Really hot.
I totally wanted to hit that.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.880
But rules are rules.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.616
(Benson)
So is that what
you told Jamie?

09:08.649 --> 09:09.983
Yeah, I said
I was really into her,

09:10.017 --> 09:11.151
but I couldn't
get with her

09:11.184 --> 09:12.920
till she knocked it out
a few times.

09:12.953 --> 09:13.921
What'd she say to that?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.022
She said, "Cool.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.190
See you Saturday night."

09:21.862 --> 09:24.331
So she solicited
two of her classmates

09:24.364 --> 09:26.166
so a third boy
would have sex with her?

09:26.199 --> 09:27.034
It looks that way.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.902
When I was a kid,
girls who had sex

09:28.936 --> 09:30.337
were afraid
of being called sluts.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.905
Now they're auditioning
for the title.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.907
The question is whether
a rape was committed

09:33.941 --> 09:34.842
in that bathroom.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.810
Jamie was looking
to lose her virginity.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.078
But it doesn't mean
she didn't say no

09:38.111 --> 09:39.713
at some point
during the encounter.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.181
Feels like
buyer's remorse to me.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.116
Look, I saw her.
The girl had P.T.S.D.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.786
You can't fake
that kind of trauma.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.020
She got caught
doing it

09:47.054 --> 09:48.689
with two guys
in the john.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.791
That's enough
to traumatize anybody.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.826
So let's bring 'em back in
and re-interview 'em all.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.794
(Fin)
We don't have to.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.829
Security camera
in the principal's office

09:55.863 --> 09:57.330
has a clear view
of the bathroom.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.932
TARU's enhancing
the tape.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.001
Well, a video will
tell us who's lying.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.874
(Benson)
Okay, so the janitor said
he entered the bathroom

10:06.907 --> 10:09.677
around 3:30.
Start the tape at 3:15.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.046
Here's the view from
the principal's office.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.950
Zooming in, zooming in.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.819
Focus.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.853
There's Jamie.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.722
I'll go back.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.358
Just waiting around.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.828
Hanging out in front
of the boys' bathroom.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.130
Here come
Danny and Cameron.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.234
You gonna tell me she's
not flirting with them?

10:34.267 --> 10:38.005
That doesn't mean that
she asked to be raped.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.173
She just grabbed his hand.
Hold on.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.412
What do you call that?

10:45.445 --> 10:48.281
Leading them on.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.721
Jamie, you said that you were
heading to the girls' bathroom.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.255
Well, someone told me
it was out of order,

10:55.288 --> 10:56.456
so I went to
the boys' bathroom.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.025
That's not what
you said before.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.894
I was freaked out, okay?
I just got raped.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.763
You were flirting
with Cameron and Danny.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.097
I wasn't flirting.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.298
Danny said something funny.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.466
I laughed.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.935
He's my friend.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.202
At least, I thought
we were friends.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.437
Jamie, you said
they dragged you

11:10.470 --> 11:11.839
into the bathroom.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.473
Now, you could see
clearly from the tape

11:13.506 --> 11:15.375
that you walked in there
on your own.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.145
Look, I asked them to guard me
while I peed, okay?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.913
I don't--
What's the big deal?

11:19.947 --> 11:21.248
The big deal is that
you lied to me.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.349
They raped me!

11:22.382 --> 11:24.351
They forced me
to have sex with them!

11:24.384 --> 11:26.253
Why don't you believe me?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.989
I want to, Jamie.
I really do.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.924
But you're making it
very difficult.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.325
Look, I don't care
what you think, okay?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.460
I know what happened.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.096
You're trying to turn this
around and make it my fault?

11:36.129 --> 11:39.900
Well, screw you, okay?
I didn't do anything wrong!

11:39.933 --> 11:41.835
What's the deal
with this girl?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.303
She seems agitated.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.337
Could she be on drugs?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.338
No, her tox screen
came up

11:45.372 --> 11:47.007
negative at the E.R.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.308
Is this post-traumatic
stress?

11:48.341 --> 11:50.978
I don't think so.
Defensiveness and hostility

11:51.011 --> 11:52.212
are not associated
with P.T.S.D.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.781
Okay, so then what's going on?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.182
She's caught in a lie,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.050
and she's terrified
of the consequences.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.052
Well, we have no proof
that she lied

11:59.086 --> 12:00.821
about the actual
rape itself.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.389
I think we do.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.256
I processed the rape kit.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.794
Danny and Cameron's DNA
match the sample

12:06.827 --> 12:08.428
taken from Jamie Hoskins.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.198
Then I tested the clothes
from all three kids.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.533
The school janitor had just
waxed the bathroom floor

12:13.566 --> 12:15.468
prior to the incident.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.806
Danny and Cameron's shirts
had wax residue on the back.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.440
But Jamie Hoskins'
blouse didn't.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.975
So Jamie said that the boys

12:22.009 --> 12:23.043
pinned her down on her back

12:23.076 --> 12:24.544
and then took turns
on top of her.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.813
That can't be true.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.247
Jamie Hoskins
had to be on top.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.281
She lied.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.349
What are you gonna do?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.019
Well, the physical trauma
and the rape kit evidence

12:32.052 --> 12:33.987
are enough
to go to trial.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.355
Wait a minute, you're
gonna charge Danny and Cameron

12:35.388 --> 12:36.556
when her story's
full of holes?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.025
If Jamie
sticks to her story,

12:38.058 --> 12:39.827
I still have
to prosecute those boys.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.895
(Benson)
Casey, isn't there any way

12:41.929 --> 12:43.496
that we can keep this
out of court?

12:43.530 --> 12:46.299
Yeah.
Get Jamie to recant.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.403
[door opens]

12:50.437 --> 12:51.839
It's cold in here.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.406
Okay, I'll get them
to turn up the heat.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.145
There we go.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.580
Here, put this on.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.916
What do you want now?

13:02.950 --> 13:05.886
I wanted to apologize
for upsetting you before.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.355
Does that mean
you believe me?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.190
It means I believe
that you never meant

13:10.223 --> 13:11.992
for any of this to happen.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.002
Jamie, we talked
to Trevor Olsen.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.537
He doesn't have
anything to do with this.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.039
Oh, I think he does.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.174
Trevor is my friend.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.976
I know that you
like Trevor,

13:29.009 --> 13:30.944
but I gotta tell you,
I think his...

13:30.978 --> 13:32.412
priorities
are really screwed up.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.947
How would you know?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.048
Trust me, any guy
that won't date you

13:35.082 --> 13:36.349
until you
lose your virginity

13:36.383 --> 13:38.018
doesn't deserve somebody
as great as you.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.987
You don't get it.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.322
I get that you're
a smart, beautiful girl

13:42.355 --> 13:44.057
who was waiting
to fall in love.

13:44.091 --> 13:48.361
And then finally,
when you meet the right guy,

13:48.395 --> 13:51.098
he lets you down.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.473
I just wanted him
to like me.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.175
I know.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.947
I mean, when...
everyone is doing it,

14:06.980 --> 14:10.250
and it's all anyone
is ever talking about...sex.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.919
It's a lot of pressure.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.954
And sometimes that pressure

14:13.987 --> 14:17.157
can lead us
to make choices that...

14:17.190 --> 14:20.994
that we wish
we hadn't made.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.167
Jamie, did you ask
Cameron and Danny

14:27.200 --> 14:30.103
to meet you
in the bathroom?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.110
Yes.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.148
And did they force you
to have sex with them?

14:44.017 --> 14:45.185
No.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.054
It was all me.
It was...

14:47.087 --> 14:50.123
It was all my fault.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.992
I'm sorry.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.294
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.432
Am I gonna go to jail?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.001
You're gonna go home
tonight and...

15:01.034 --> 15:05.205
I'll talk to the D.A.
in the morning.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.308
I never meant to hurt anyone.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.512
I know.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.647
You sent her home?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.349
That girl tried
to ruin my son's life.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.051
I understand how
you must feel, Mr. Shaw.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.186
I doubt it!

15:19.219 --> 15:21.254
They're throwing Cameron
out of school.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.391
He graduates in five weeks.
He could lose his scholarship.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.393
Your son violated Lanchester
Prep's code of conduct

15:26.426 --> 15:28.495
by having sex
on school grounds.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.397
Cameron was never in trouble
a day in his life.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.133
It's that damn girl!
She seduced him!

15:33.166 --> 15:35.135
Nobody forced Cameron
into that bathroom.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.071
That girl made false charges
against my son.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.106
That's a crime.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.141
I want her charged.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.575
I'll decide that after
I review the evidence.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.111
We bent over backwards

15:44.144 --> 15:46.246
to get the facts before
we arrested your son.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.581
Jamie Hoskins deserves
the same consideration.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.051
Fine.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.020
But if she's not arrested,

15:53.053 --> 15:55.122
you'll read about it
in the newspaper.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.058
White girl lies about
being raped by a black boy...

15:58.091 --> 16:00.160
and just walks away.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.230
They'll be all over it.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.100
[door slams]

16:07.134 --> 16:11.238
Well, I guess we know
where he stands.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.305
How about you?

16:12.339 --> 16:13.273
He has a point.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.443
Jamie did file a false
report with the police.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.478
Jamie made a mistake,
but she's paying for it.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.580
I mean, she also got
kicked out of school.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.282
Cameron's dad isn't gonna
go away anytime soon,

16:22.315 --> 16:25.052
and Danny Morrison's lawyer
is on my voicemail.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.419
Those boys
got themselves expelled.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.056
And as for Jamie,
she lied to us.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.224
[cell phone rings]
It was our time
she wasted.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.492
Benson.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.330
Where?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.199
I'm on my way.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.280
Car drove
onto the sidewalk,

16:53.313 --> 16:55.182
straight into
a bunch of pedestrians.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.349
How many are injured?

16:56.383 --> 16:59.186
Nine, one critical.
Driver's over there.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.433
Excuse me.

17:13.466 --> 17:14.734
Jamie?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.170
It's Detective Benson.
Can you tell me what happened?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.571
They're trying to kill me.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.706
They're all
trying to kill me.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.108
Nobody's trying
to kill you.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.309
You're lying to me!

17:22.342 --> 17:23.643
They're all trying
to kill me!
Calm down.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.313
No, no, please, please!
Calm down, Jamie.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.215
You have to help me!
Please! Please!

17:28.248 --> 17:31.218
Ow, ow! God!

17:31.251 --> 17:32.385
(woman)
Detective.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.589
The vehicle's trajectory
indicates

17:36.623 --> 17:39.259
she swerved
to avoid the pedestrians.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.228
So it was an accident.
Not exactly.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.463
There are no skid marks
on the street

17:43.496 --> 17:44.531
or the sidewalk.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.266
She never hit the brakes

17:46.299 --> 17:48.135
and she wasn't
wearing her seatbelt.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.338
She was trying
to kill herself.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.345
Skull fracture here.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.513
Put him in trauma two
and page neuro.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.482
Busy week for Jamie Hoskins.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.184
How's she doing?

18:04.217 --> 18:06.186
Laceration on her forehead,
minor cuts and bruises.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.254
Her victims
weren't so lucky.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.256
Fractured limbs,
two concussions,

18:09.289 --> 18:11.158
a crushed pelvis,

18:11.191 --> 18:14.161
and one 14-year-old girl
with massive internal injuries.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.263
One tire of the car
rolled over her chest.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.131
She died five minutes ago.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.434
Dad's over there.
Mr. Ramirez.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.606
Mr. Ramirez.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.375
I'm Detective Benson.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.543
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.681
Did they catch the guy
who did this to Elena?

18:34.714 --> 18:39.586
Yes, we have
the driver in custody.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.222
Was he drinking?

18:43.523 --> 18:46.293
The driver
was a teenage girl.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.195
And, uh, no,

18:48.228 --> 18:51.198
we don't believe that
she was intoxicated.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.778
(doctor)
Detective...

19:05.812 --> 19:09.216
We ran a comprehensive
tox screen on Jamie Hoskins.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.783
S.O.P. for
attempted suicides.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.385
Did she have drugs
in her system?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.287
Only valproate and celexa,

19:14.321 --> 19:16.256
which are used to treat
bipolar disorder.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.258
Jamie's bipolar?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.327
The school psychologist
didn't tell me that.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.694
There's a good chance
the school doesn't know.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.265
Jamie's probably being treated
by a private psychiatrist.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.366
Could those medications
have caused the accident?

19:26.399 --> 19:27.467
I doubt it.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.370
Both drugs were present
well below therapeutic levels.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.339
So you're saying that Jamie
hadn't been taking her meds?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.241
Possibly for a week,
maybe longer.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.577
Which likely led to a manic
episode and her suicide attempt.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.450
Could a manic episode lead her
to act out sexually?

19:43.483 --> 19:45.318
Hypersexuality is common

19:45.352 --> 19:47.754
among unmedicated
bipolars.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.256
Jamie's parents have been
out of the country.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.557
Maybe she stopped taking
her meds when they left.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.591
You can ask them.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.759
They got back this morning.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.794
Sitting over there
in the corner.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.401
This just doesn't
make any sense.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.403
I mean, Jamie always
takes her medication,

20:03.436 --> 20:05.272
ever since she was
diagnosed last year.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.806
At the beginning,
we counted her pills

20:06.839 --> 20:07.940
to make sure that she
was on schedule.

20:07.974 --> 20:11.378
But...she's always been
diligent about taking them.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.713
Jamie said that you're
both musicians.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.415
Do you travel often?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.717
We used to, but since
Jamie's diagnosis,

20:17.750 --> 20:20.487
we make sure that one of us
is always at home with her.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.490
This is the first time
that we've both left her.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.325
So how did she seem
before you left?

20:25.358 --> 20:27.494
Any odd behavior
or mood swings?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.362
No, she was
perfectly fine.

20:29.396 --> 20:33.366
Jamie has seen Dr. Porterman
every week...without fail.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.369
She--she told us
everything was under control.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.438
I'd like to talk to Jamie.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.807
Are you going
to arrest her?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.310
That's for
the D.A. decide.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.412
The only thing I can tell you
is she might be more sympathetic

20:45.445 --> 20:48.581
if I get Jamie's side
of the story.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.884
Why didn't you tell me
you were bipolar?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.354
I didn't want you
to think I was crazy.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.690
You're not crazy, Jamie.
You have an illness.

20:57.724 --> 21:01.294
Just like diabetes
or migraine headaches,

21:01.328 --> 21:04.297
you take medication...
and you get better.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.899
Yeah, but people
treat you differently.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.836
I mean, like my grandma,
I told her,

21:09.869 --> 21:12.839
and now she looks
at me all funny.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.907
And this kid in my class,
he takes pills,

21:14.941 --> 21:17.377
and now everyone
calls him psycho.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.412
Is that why you went off
your medication?

21:19.446 --> 21:21.414
I was feeling fine.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.750
I hadn't had any mood swings
in, like, a year.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.754
Did you ever stop to think
that maybe you were feeling fine

21:27.787 --> 21:31.491
because you were
taking your medication?

21:31.524 --> 21:32.925
I thought I was cured.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.397
Jamie, didn't
your psychiatrist

21:37.430 --> 21:39.766
explain to you that
it's really, really dangerous

21:39.799 --> 21:41.668
to go off your medication?

21:41.701 --> 21:42.835
Yes, but...

21:42.869 --> 21:45.372
Derek says
that's not true.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.706
Derek who?

21:46.739 --> 21:49.041
Derek Lord.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.577
The rock star?
Yeah.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.044
He's amazing.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.713
I have all of his CDs,

21:53.746 --> 21:56.383
and I've been to his concert,
like, five times.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.017
Jamie, hold on.
I'm sorry.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.454
What does Derek Lord
have to do with any of this?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.724
I was getting ready
for school last week,

22:04.757 --> 22:06.759
and he was being
interviewed on TV.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.462
He says you don't need
psychiatric drugs

22:09.496 --> 22:11.398
to make you feel better.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.465
How would he know?

22:12.499 --> 22:13.299
He's really smart.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.803
He even has a book,
Free Yourself.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.472
He says that using
psychiatric drugs

22:19.506 --> 22:22.509
is like putting poison
inside your body.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.445
And you decided to listen
to Derek Lord...

22:25.478 --> 22:27.414
instead of your psychiatrist?

22:27.447 --> 22:28.815
Yeah, I mean...

22:28.848 --> 22:31.484
it's a really great book.

22:31.518 --> 22:35.522
Changed my life.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.756
A lot of my young fans
have been diagnosed

22:36.789 --> 22:38.625
with bogus psychiatric
disorders, Jackie,

22:38.658 --> 22:40.593
and then put on
dangerous drugs.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.395
Some reviewers,
including a number

22:42.429 --> 22:44.664
of doctors and scientists,
have criticized your book

22:44.697 --> 22:46.666
as inaccurate
and misinformed.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.168
(Derek)
Trust me,
I've done the research.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.137
Shrinks use dangerous,
mind-altering chemicals

22:51.170 --> 22:53.573
to control the brains
of innocent people.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.675
Everyone should stop
taking these poisons.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.577
There's lives at stake here.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.181
What makes a rock musician
think he's an expert

23:02.214 --> 23:03.650
on psychiatry?

23:03.683 --> 23:05.518
That's a good question.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.587
If I could, I'd charge
Derek Lord as a co-defendant.

23:07.620 --> 23:11.157
First Amendment says that he's
got a right to his opinion.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.192
This is one hell of a mess.
Look, I screwed up.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.026
Jamie was upset.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.429
I should have never
let her go home.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.530
You had no reason
to hold her,

23:17.564 --> 23:19.532
and you couldn't know she'd
steal your parent's car.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.601
She ran down those people
right after we released her.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.202
Makes us look negligent.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.504
The sooner we charge
this girl, the better.

23:24.537 --> 23:25.772
It's not that simple.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.441
Jamie was having an acute
psychotic episode.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.610
Which she suffered
after choosing

23:30.643 --> 23:32.445
to stop taking
her medication.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.548
We already
have one dead girl.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.716
So who benefits from

23:36.749 --> 23:38.551
destroying
the life of another?

23:38.585 --> 23:39.586
She's got a point, Captain.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.854
What are you suggesting?

23:41.888 --> 23:43.590
Probation with
mandatory counseling.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.692
For vehicular manslaughter?

23:45.725 --> 23:47.827
I'm not gonna throw
the book at this girl

23:47.860 --> 23:50.597
just to satisfy
your bosses downtown.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.632
This wasn't some disturbed
homeless person.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.167
This girl had the best
drugs and treatment available.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.738
Yeah, which her idol
told her to stop taking.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.774
Okay...

24:01.808 --> 24:03.676
This is your call.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.178
You just remember
we got two boys

24:06.212 --> 24:08.548
whose lives were ruined
by her false allegations.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.550
A dead girl
and half a dozen others

24:10.583 --> 24:13.219
injured when Jamie
mowed them down.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.220
Now, you let her walk,

24:14.253 --> 24:16.823
your ass is on the line
right next to mine.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.667
(Warner)
Victim sustained multiple
abrasions and contusions

24:27.700 --> 24:29.636
from being dragged 30 feet.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.739
Internal injuries include
fractures to the ribs and spine,

24:32.772 --> 24:35.608
liver laceration,
and spleenic rupture,

24:35.642 --> 24:38.511
and a skull fracture consistent
with medium velocity

24:38.545 --> 24:40.780
motor vehicle impact.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.650
Hey, what are you doing here?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.852
I needed to see the victim.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.755
Everything you need to know
will be in my report.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.792
God, she's so young.

24:52.825 --> 24:56.629
14...just 2 years younger
than Jamie Hoskins.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.798
Did she suffer?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.002
She was trapped under the car
for more than 20 minutes.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.274
She was conscious
most of the time.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.546
Casey.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.650
I thought if I saw her,
it might make it easier.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.786
Make what easier?

25:19.819 --> 25:23.289
Putting a mentally ill girl
in prison.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.595
So did it help?

25:30.697 --> 25:32.732
Send me that report.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.805
Jamie Hoskins
should be at home

25:38.838 --> 25:40.006
where her parents
can supervise her.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.974
We request
an ROR release.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.010
The People object,
Your Honor.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.712
My client is not
a flight risk,

25:45.745 --> 25:46.613
and her illness requires
specialized treatment

25:46.646 --> 25:48.014
and monitoring.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.716
Ms. Novak.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.017
The People will stipulate
to the defendant's release,

25:51.050 --> 25:52.652
provided she wears
an ankle monitor.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.653
No objection.

25:53.686 --> 25:54.654
We also request

25:54.687 --> 25:56.055
a court order mandating

25:56.088 --> 25:58.625
strict compliance with
the defendant's drug regimen.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.660
(judge)
So ordered.
The defendant is released

26:00.693 --> 26:02.629
in her parents' custody
until trial.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.796
10-minute recess.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.705
How could you let her go?

26:12.739 --> 26:15.742
I understand
you're upset.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.044
But the judge feels
Jamie's not dangerous

26:18.077 --> 26:19.712
as long as she stays
with her parents,

26:19.746 --> 26:20.780
she takes her medication.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.749
This isn't right.

26:22.782 --> 26:23.750
I promise you...

26:23.783 --> 26:25.718
she'll get a fair trial.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.754
Hmm.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.355
Not with that guy
on their side.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.623
(woman)
Why are you here?

26:30.657 --> 26:33.793
(man)
Mr. Lord wants to support
the Hoskins family

26:33.826 --> 26:34.727
as they fight
these unjust causes.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.729
(Lord)
Jamie Hoskins is being framed.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.298
The police and the district
attorney both say she killed...

26:39.331 --> 26:40.667
Derek Lord.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.334
In the flesh.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.403
to take dangerous,
mind-altering chemicals.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.638
They're the ones
with the blood on their hands.

26:45.672 --> 26:46.505
Jamie's a victim.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.008
And if her parents
will allow it,

26:49.041 --> 26:50.242
I'd like to pay
for her defense.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.310
Thank you.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.680
And on behalf of all victims
of psychiatric abuse,

26:53.713 --> 26:55.815
we're gonna win this fight.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.720
[cameras click]

27:05.692 --> 27:08.394
So much for
a quiet little trial.

27:08.427 --> 27:09.461
Derek Lord's presence
in the courtroom

27:09.495 --> 27:11.898
is bound to influence
the jury in Jamie's favor.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.666
Derek Lord
is using this girl

27:13.700 --> 27:16.068
to push his anti-psychiatry
agenda.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.771
Nuts like this
have been around for years.

27:18.805 --> 27:19.939
Maybe there's
a reason for that.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.775
Kid doesn't fit the mold,
so he's got LD,

27:22.809 --> 27:25.745
ADD, HDD, ADHD.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.446
They can give him
powerful drugs like Ritalin,

27:27.479 --> 27:29.081
Concerta, or aderal.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.983
But there is a huge
difference

27:31.017 --> 27:32.919
between over-diagnosis

27:32.952 --> 27:34.687
and telling
legitimately sick patients

27:34.721 --> 27:36.756
to abandon
lifesaving treatments.

27:36.789 --> 27:37.690
I'm just saying,

27:37.724 --> 27:39.759
whatever happened to 'em
having a lousy day?

27:39.792 --> 27:41.360
I agree with that--
it seems like everyone's

27:41.393 --> 27:42.695
a victim of something
these days.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.797
But Jamie Hoskins
is bipolar.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.866
So that girl should walk
because she got bad advice

27:46.899 --> 27:49.702
from some clown with
a microphone and leather pants?

27:49.736 --> 27:52.739
Derek Lord is a role model.
Kids look up to him.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.040
He shouldn't
go on spouting off

27:54.073 --> 27:55.742
about things that
he doesn't understand.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.843
Kids are being bombarded

27:56.876 --> 27:58.845
by thousands of messages
every day

27:58.878 --> 28:00.046
telling them
to buy everything

28:00.079 --> 28:01.814
from zit cream
to potato chips.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.149
They learn to say no.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.884
Yeah, but Jamie isn't
an ordinary kid.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.053
Right. She has
a very serious illness.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.121
But that shouldn't
automatically excuse her

28:09.155 --> 28:10.456
from what she did.

28:10.489 --> 28:11.891
It's easy to judge
mental illness

28:11.924 --> 28:14.693
if you've never had
to deal with it yourself.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.466
(Novak)
I'm willing to make a deal.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.235
Jamie pleads guilty
to involuntary manslaughter,

28:23.269 --> 28:25.437
she serves six months
in a psychiatric facility.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.874
You only wanna settle because
you know she's innocent.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.976
Actually,
I'm trying to spare

28:30.009 --> 28:32.011
everyone involved
further trauma.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.512
Just out of curiosity,

28:33.545 --> 28:36.282
what exactly is your role
here, Mr. Lord?

28:36.315 --> 28:37.850
To make sure you don't
blame the victim.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.318
If you're truly interested

28:39.351 --> 28:40.753
in avoiding further trauma,

28:40.787 --> 28:42.855
why not simply
drop the charges?

28:42.889 --> 28:44.323
I can't do that.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.826
Jamie's actions caused
the death of Elena Ramirez

28:46.859 --> 28:48.027
and severe injury
to six others.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.896
Well, maybe
we should consider--

28:49.929 --> 28:51.898
No way. This is
a matter of principle.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.299
This is a matter
of our daughter's life.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.934
Mr. and Mrs. Hoskins,

28:54.967 --> 28:56.035
as Jamie's parents,
you have the sole power

28:56.068 --> 28:57.904
to negotiate
on her behalf.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.806
This is your decision.

28:59.839 --> 29:00.873
Mom, please,
I trust Derek.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.241
He knows how
to handle this.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.444
(Derek)
Ms. Novak, psychiatry
has damaged countless lives.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.279
Elena Ramirez is just
the latest victim.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.281
I'm not here to debate

29:09.315 --> 29:10.883
the legitimacy
of psychiatric medicine.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.952
But I do think
it's unfair to Jamie

29:12.985 --> 29:15.855
to use her trial as a platform
for your political views.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.389
They're not just my views.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.525
Libertarians,
fundamentalist Christians,

29:19.558 --> 29:20.793
Scientologists.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.295
Even practicing
psychiatrists.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.497
There are caring people that
have been fighting this battle

29:25.531 --> 29:27.333
ever since
German psychiatrists

29:27.366 --> 29:29.902
were convicted of war crimes
at Nuremberg.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.537
I can call on any number
of experts to testify

29:31.570 --> 29:32.972
that psychiatry not only
helps people,

29:33.005 --> 29:34.807
it saves lives.

29:34.841 --> 29:37.877
Psychiatry is a corrupt
instrument of social control.

29:37.910 --> 29:41.814
No offense, Ms. Novak,
but you're a lawyer.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.282
And you're a rock star,
so you'll understand

29:43.315 --> 29:46.018
if I don't defer to your
expertise on the subject.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.257
I'll see you in court.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.495
(Novak)
Dr. Porterman, can you
describe the circumstances

29:56.528 --> 29:59.866
under which Jamie Hoskins
became your patient?

29:59.899 --> 30:01.267
She was in
a hypo-manic state

30:01.300 --> 30:03.235
after months of
debilitating depression.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.005
(Novak)
You diagnosed her
with bipolar disorder.

30:06.038 --> 30:06.873
(Dr. Porterman)
Yes, yes, she presented

30:06.906 --> 30:07.874
all the classic symptoms.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.009
So I prescribed
a combination of valproate,

30:10.042 --> 30:11.844
a mood stabilizer,

30:11.878 --> 30:13.412
and an antidepressant.

30:13.445 --> 30:17.850
How would you characterize
Jamie's reaction to these drugs?

30:17.884 --> 30:20.086
As soon as the drugs
were properly titrated,

30:20.119 --> 30:22.188
Jamie's symptoms
disappeared.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.191
Now, did Jamie understand
how important it was

30:25.224 --> 30:27.293
to faithfully take
her medication?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.896
Yes, we devoted an entire
session to it.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.230
I showed her the statistics
on relapse,

30:31.263 --> 30:33.032
we talked about how she
would get very sick.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.601
Jamie understood
the risks.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.870
Thank you.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.205
You said that Jamie

30:39.238 --> 30:42.341
understood the risk
of going off her medication.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.944
Did she understand
the risk posed

30:44.977 --> 30:46.378
by the medications
themselves?

30:46.412 --> 30:48.948
Well, if you're referring
to liver function,

30:48.981 --> 30:50.216
Jamie undergoes
periodic blood tests.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.251
Could you describe
how valproate works

30:52.284 --> 30:53.485
to relieve
Jamie's symptoms?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.955
It aids neuronal
transmission by--

30:55.988 --> 30:57.223
And how does it do that?

30:57.256 --> 30:59.992
Well, the exact mechanism
is unknown.

31:00.026 --> 31:03.129
So you prescribed
a powerful psychotropic drug

31:03.162 --> 31:05.031
to a 16-year-old girl

31:05.064 --> 31:07.066
without knowing
how it works?

31:07.099 --> 31:08.400
My job is to diagnose
mental illness

31:08.434 --> 31:10.636
and relieve the symptoms.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.938
Fine.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.073
Could you tell the court

31:14.106 --> 31:16.008
what medical tests
you used

31:16.042 --> 31:18.945
to diagnose Ms. Hoskins'
bipolar illness?

31:18.978 --> 31:20.646
I took
a detailed history.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.015
Observed the symptoms.

31:23.049 --> 31:23.882
We spoke at length
about--

31:23.916 --> 31:26.218
No, what medical tests
did you perform?

31:26.252 --> 31:27.987
Blood analysis, X-ray,

31:28.020 --> 31:30.990
CAT scan?
No such tests
currently exist

31:31.023 --> 31:33.092
to diagnose
bipolar illness.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.295
So to review...

31:36.328 --> 31:39.298
there's no medical test
to diagnose it,

31:39.331 --> 31:42.401
you're not sure how the drugs
you prescribe affect it,

31:42.434 --> 31:45.204
but you're confident
my client has bipolar illness

31:45.237 --> 31:46.638
and that you've got it
under control.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.440
Objection.
Withdrawn.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.076
Last question.

31:50.109 --> 31:54.280
Did Jamie Hoskins have
a history of violent behavior

31:54.313 --> 31:56.315
prior to taking
the psychotropic drugs

31:56.348 --> 31:58.050
you prescribed?

32:01.287 --> 32:02.955
No.

32:02.989 --> 32:06.125
Another victory
for modern psychiatry.

32:09.728 --> 32:13.232
The drugs made me feel like
I was living in slow motion.

32:13.265 --> 32:17.136
I had no energy,
no emotions.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.738
I just didn't feel like me.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.640
I just wanted
to be myself again.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.709
No further questions.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.978
Jamie, why did you
see Dr. Porterman

32:26.012 --> 32:28.047
in the first place?

32:28.080 --> 32:30.016
My parents
were worried about me.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.284
Were you depressed?

32:32.318 --> 32:34.020
I guess, I don't know.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.022
I mean,
I was sleeping a lot.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.223
Messing up in school.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.225
And then what happened?

32:39.258 --> 32:41.260
And then I started
to feel a lot better.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.996
I was getting a ton
of stuff done,

32:44.030 --> 32:46.665
and I hardly
slept at all.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.034
Well, were you worried?

32:48.067 --> 32:50.036
No, I felt great.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.671
I mean, except my parents
and some of my friends

32:52.704 --> 32:54.640
said I was talking
really fast

32:54.673 --> 32:57.043
and--and losing
my temper a lot.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.044
(Novak)
Did these symptoms stop

32:58.077 --> 32:59.678
when you started
taking the drugs

32:59.711 --> 33:01.413
prescribed by
Dr. Porterman?

33:01.447 --> 33:04.150
I guess.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.152
Then why did you stop
taking your medication?

33:06.185 --> 33:08.520
'Cause I wanted to feel
normal again.
Normal?

33:08.554 --> 33:12.124
In the short time you stopped
taking your medication,

33:12.158 --> 33:14.260
you lost your virginity
in the school bathroom,

33:14.293 --> 33:16.062
you falsely accused

33:16.095 --> 33:17.029
two classmates of rape,

33:17.063 --> 33:19.065
and now six people
are in the hospital

33:19.098 --> 33:20.699
and a young girl is dead!

33:20.732 --> 33:21.733
Those things
were not my fault!

33:21.767 --> 33:22.768
Really?

33:22.801 --> 33:24.336
Then who's to blame?

33:24.370 --> 33:25.571
Them!

33:26.705 --> 33:28.174
Your parents?

33:28.207 --> 33:30.309
Yes, they made me go
to Dr. Porterman!

33:30.342 --> 33:32.044
They let him put
that stuff in my body!

33:32.078 --> 33:35.147
My parents
have ruined my life.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.130
I'm really sorry.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.165
I can't even imagine
how difficult

33:53.199 --> 33:55.234
this must be for you.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.203
(mother)
Yeah, it's like we don't
even know her anymore.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.270
(father)
And she's totally infatuated

33:58.304 --> 34:01.140
with this guy, like everything
he says is gospel.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.143
I know, and I think he really
believes he's helping her.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.311
At first,
we were grateful.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.312
I mean,
we could never afford

34:06.345 --> 34:08.147
a lawyer like Mr. Zierko.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.448
But now...

34:11.350 --> 34:14.153
Look, we've been monitoring
Jamie's medication.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.321
Janet!
We have to tell her.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.189
She needs to know.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.190
Know what?

34:18.224 --> 34:22.228
Jamie stopped taking her pills
four days ago.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.704
I've excused the jury because
it's come to my attention

34:32.738 --> 34:35.274
you may not be taking
your medication.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.276
I don't need those pills.
They're poison!

34:37.309 --> 34:39.278
Complying with
your drug regimen

34:39.311 --> 34:41.313
was a condition of your
release, Ms. Hoskins.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.814
If you refuse,

34:42.848 --> 34:45.251
then I am forced to remand you
to the hospital ward

34:45.284 --> 34:47.719
of the juvenile
detention facility where,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.288
if necessary,

34:49.321 --> 34:52.124
your medication will be
administered by force.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.693
Your Honor, the court
can't compel my client

34:54.726 --> 34:56.762
to take her medication.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.864
Section 9.0 of the New York
Mental Hygiene Law

34:58.897 --> 34:59.998
allows the government

35:00.031 --> 35:02.234
to protect mentally ill
individuals who pose a threat

35:02.268 --> 35:04.203
to themselves or others.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.171
Ms. Hoskins,

35:05.204 --> 35:07.873
will you take your medication
as directed?

35:07.906 --> 35:10.276
You can't make me put
that stuff in my body!

35:10.309 --> 35:11.143
Yes, I can.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.278
Take the defendant
into custody.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.845
What?!
Come on, miss.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.781
No, get your hands off me!
Stop it!

35:15.814 --> 35:17.649
Take it easy.
No! Let me go!

35:17.683 --> 35:19.918
Calm down!

35:19.951 --> 35:21.153
Let me go!

35:21.187 --> 35:22.321
Stop!

35:22.354 --> 35:24.290
[screaming]
No, let me go!

35:24.323 --> 35:26.458
Let's get her out.
Come on.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.265
(Benson)
They treating you okay in here?

35:33.299 --> 35:35.434
Yeah, the nurse took off
the restraints

35:35.467 --> 35:37.503
as soon as the meds
kicked in.

35:37.536 --> 35:40.739
Jamie...

35:40.772 --> 35:43.509
I'm so sorry that it
came out like this.

35:43.542 --> 35:47.213
You did everything
you could to help me.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.281
Everyone did.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.220
I hurt so many people.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.423
I killed that poor girl.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.329
The nurse told me that you
refused to see your parents.

36:03.362 --> 36:06.265
Jamie, I know
that Derek Lord

36:06.298 --> 36:09.435
seems like
some sort of hero.

36:09.468 --> 36:13.305
But your parents are the ones
that really love you.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.175
I know.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.547
I can't believe
I let Derek convince me

36:21.580 --> 36:22.681
that my parents were

36:22.714 --> 36:24.450
trying to hurt me.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.984
It's just
after he told me

36:26.017 --> 36:28.354
what his parents
did to him...

36:34.393 --> 36:35.894
(Novak)
You were called by the defense

36:35.927 --> 36:37.229
as an expert witness.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.298
Did you study psychiatry
in college?

36:39.331 --> 36:40.932
I didn't go to college.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.534
But I read many texts
on the subject

36:42.568 --> 36:44.035
and talked
to hundreds of people.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.972
(Novak)
Is it true that you opposed
psychiatric care in all forms?

36:47.005 --> 36:48.407
I do.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.376
Is it also true
that at the age of 14

36:50.409 --> 36:51.843
you were committed to
the Mayview Psychiatric Hospital

36:51.877 --> 36:52.878
in Rhode Island?

36:52.911 --> 36:53.912
Objection.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.314
Mr. Lord is not
on trial here.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.315
His views on

36:56.348 --> 36:58.284
psychiatry are
part of the record.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.386
The People have a right
to explore their basis.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.387
(judge)
I'll allow it.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.390
I was committed by my parents
against my will.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.391
They forced you
to take drugs,

37:05.424 --> 37:08.927
just like Jamie Hoskins'
parents are forcing her.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.297
That's right.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.399
But it was just drug therapy
that they gave you,

37:13.432 --> 37:15.233
was it, Mr. Lord?

37:16.968 --> 37:18.404
No.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.239
What other treatments
were you given at Mayview?

37:22.308 --> 37:23.875
ECT.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.578
(Novak)
Can you please tell the jury
what that stands for?

37:26.612 --> 37:28.847
(Derek)
Electro Convulsive Therapy.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.383
Also known as electric shock
therapy, isn't that right?

37:31.417 --> 37:34.553
They strap you down
to a special table

37:34.586 --> 37:36.455
that flips over.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.391
So that you don't
choke on your own vomit.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.394
Then they inject you
with a muscle relaxant.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.363
Then they tape electrodes

37:44.396 --> 37:45.564
to your forehead,

37:45.597 --> 37:47.333
and then turn up the juice.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.068
When your toe
starts twitching,

37:50.101 --> 37:51.537
that means you're having
a major convulsion,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.539
which is what they want.

37:53.572 --> 37:57.042
It's what they call
"healing."

37:59.044 --> 38:01.447
Why did they perform
this procedure?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.281
[sighs]

38:05.016 --> 38:09.087
Because...they said I was
psychotic depressive.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.021
And, in fact,

38:10.055 --> 38:13.091
didn't you attempt suicide
three weeks prior

38:13.124 --> 38:14.493
to your parents'
committing you?

38:14.526 --> 38:15.894
It was a mistake.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.429
You took enough pills

38:17.463 --> 38:18.930
to cause permanent
brain damage.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.932
And the cure for that
was for them to pass

38:20.966 --> 38:24.403
huge amounts of electric current
through my brain.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.673
ECT fried my memory.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.342
Huge chunks
of my childhood gone!

38:30.376 --> 38:35.647
It was painful,
dehumanizing torture.

38:38.617 --> 38:42.388
I'll never know how much
damage they did to me.

38:42.421 --> 38:47.426
That sounds like
a terrible ordeal.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.994
Tell me...

38:49.027 --> 38:51.363
after you got out
of the hospital,

38:51.397 --> 38:54.566
did you ever
attempt suicide again?

38:54.600 --> 38:57.469
No.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.405
And now you're a rich,
successful musician

38:59.438 --> 39:01.440
with millions of fans.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.442
Isn't it possible
that psychiatry

39:03.475 --> 39:05.944
didn't ruin your life...

39:05.977 --> 39:08.514
it saved it?

39:16.755 --> 39:18.490
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

39:18.524 --> 39:20.392
have you reached a decision?

39:20.426 --> 39:22.394
(man)
We have, Your Honor.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.396
(judge)
On the first count
of Vehicular Manslaughter

39:24.430 --> 39:27.032
in the Second Degree,
how do you find?

39:27.065 --> 39:30.135
We find the defendant,
Jamie Hoskins,

39:30.168 --> 39:31.503
guilty as charged.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.541
(judge)
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

39:35.574 --> 39:36.908
thank you for your service.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.578
The defendant is remanded
pending sentencing.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.680
Court is adjourned.
[gavel pounds]

39:41.713 --> 39:44.616
[sobs]
Mom.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.890
I'm sorry.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.495
I'm going to recommend

39:56.528 --> 39:58.430
that you be sentenced
as a juvenile.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.098
So there's a good chance
you'll be placed

40:00.131 --> 40:01.733
in a residential
psychiatric facility.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.503
Okay?
Thank you.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.505
Miss Hoskins?

40:06.538 --> 40:08.039
It's okay.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.084
[knocks]

40:21.687 --> 40:23.221
Tough case.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.191
Yeah.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.594
I mean, for you.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.608
I met this guy
in law school.

40:44.209 --> 40:47.045
He was brilliant and funny.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.549
And we got engaged
during our final year.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.518
You look happy.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.620
We were.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.622
So what happened?

40:56.655 --> 40:59.525
Well, Charlie started
acting strange.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.993
He became withdrawn.

41:02.027 --> 41:04.095
Paranoid.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.965
He'd disappear
for days at a time.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.868
What was wrong with him?

41:09.901 --> 41:12.671
Schizophrenia.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.507
It was horrible.

41:15.541 --> 41:18.644
And the worst part was
he refused to be treated.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.112
He wouldn't take
any medication.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.682
I struck it out
for a while,

41:23.715 --> 41:26.117
but in the end,
I couldn't handle it.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.919
I broke off the engagement.

41:27.953 --> 41:31.256
What happened to him?

41:33.024 --> 41:36.027
I don't know.
Last I heard, he was homeless.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.667
Well, you did what
you had to do.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.268
You saved yourself.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.270
Yeah, but nobody saved him.

41:45.303 --> 41:48.506
