01:00.927 --> 01:02.895
_

01:05.899 --> 01:08.300
Kion? Kiara?
Let's go!

01:08.335 --> 01:10.903
We're gonna be late for
the elephants' concert.

01:10.937 --> 01:12.938
You know it's considered
an insult

01:12.973 --> 01:15.908
if the royal family is
not there for the first song.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.276
The first song's the best part!

01:17.310 --> 01:19.979
- Race you there.
- Oh, yeah.

01:20.013 --> 01:23.983
- Shall we?
- Yes. But we don't need to race.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.317
Kion! Kion!

01:25.352 --> 01:28.921
We've got antelopes stuck in a
mud pool near Chekundu Cliffs.

01:28.955 --> 01:32.057
- Anyone hurt?
- No, but they're really stuck.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.060
That big rainstorm last night
must've caused a mud slide.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.964
Dad? I'm gonna have to miss the
elephants' rainy season concert.

01:38.999 --> 01:42.935
It's okay, Kion. I'm sure
the elephants will understand.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.337
Keeping the animals of the
Pride Lands safe is your duty.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.339
Right. Let's go, Ono.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.175
Say hi to Ma Tembo
and the elephants for me!

01:50.210 --> 01:52.144
- We will.
- Stay alert, son!

01:52.178 --> 01:55.314
Come on. We still have
a concert to go to.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.349
Do you think the elephants will do that

01:57.350 --> 01:59.351
song with all the
really loud trumpeting?

01:59.386 --> 02:03.022
They always do the song
with the loud trumpeting.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.290
It's tradition.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.126
Sometimes I think
my greatest duty as King

02:07.160 --> 02:10.863
is upholding the
Pride Lands' traditions.

02:10.896 --> 02:13.265
And one day, it will be
your duty, Princess.

02:13.300 --> 02:17.202
Attending concerts is one
duty I know I can handle.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.108
- Simba? What is it?
- Do you feel that?

02:24.244 --> 02:28.247
- Kiara! Move uphill! Now!
- What? Why?

02:28.281 --> 02:29.882
Sinkhole!

02:31.351 --> 02:32.885
Get back!

02:37.688 --> 02:39.224
Oh, my!

02:39.225 --> 02:41.994
- Daddy!
- Simba!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.133
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

02:49.970 --> 02:51.303
Giddy-up, anti-lanti-lope!

02:54.174 --> 02:56.942
- Whoa! What was that?
- Looking.

02:58.979 --> 03:03.182
<i>Hapana! 
A sinkhole! Someone's fallen in...</i>

03:03.216 --> 03:05.084
And I think it's the King!

03:05.118 --> 03:06.118
Simba?

03:06.152 --> 03:08.053
Dad? Is he all right?

03:08.088 --> 03:10.889
Sorry, Kion. I...
I couldn't tell.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.958
Kion, go. We got this.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.094
Thanks, Fuli.
Ono, lead the way!

03:15.128 --> 03:16.195
Affirmative!

03:20.900 --> 03:23.268
Come on, move it!
The sooner we get you outta here,

03:23.303 --> 03:25.170
the sooner we can help Kion!

03:25.205 --> 03:28.207
Easy, Little B.
I got just the trick.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.943
There we go!

03:30.977 --> 03:32.177
Nice one, Big B.

03:33.279 --> 03:36.215
Now let's go help Kion save Simba!

03:36.249 --> 03:38.951
Till the Pride Lands end...

03:38.985 --> 03:41.020
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

03:44.290 --> 03:45.357
Simba?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.327
Simba!

03:48.361 --> 03:49.928
Simba!

03:49.963 --> 03:50.996
Daddy!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.999
I'm... I'm okay, Nala!

03:54.034 --> 03:56.135
I'm okay.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.336
Can you climb out?

03:57.370 --> 04:01.073
I don't think so.
There's nothing to grab onto.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.175
And I'm too far down to jump out.

04:03.209 --> 04:07.880
- Kion! Over here!
- Mom, Mom! Is Dad okay?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.848
I think so. But he's stuck.

04:09.883 --> 04:14.086
Don't worry, Your Majesty!
Lion Guard to the rescue!

04:14.120 --> 04:15.287
Bunga! Wait!

04:15.321 --> 04:18.923
<i>- Zuka Zama!
Whoa!
- eLittle B!</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.897
- Bunga?
- H-Hey! That was fun!

04:24.931 --> 04:26.932
Hello to you too, Bunga.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.901
Whoa! What happened
to your mane?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.036
Bunga.

04:31.071 --> 04:34.239
What were you thinking,
jumping down here?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.941
What was I thinking?

04:35.975 --> 04:39.878
- I was thinking of rescuing you.
- Exactly how?

04:39.913 --> 04:42.281
Uh... Give ya a boost?

04:42.315 --> 04:45.918
<i>Bunga? Dad?
You two all right?</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:50.022
Bunga is fine.
My head cushioned his fall.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.357
<i>What happened, Dad?
How'd you get down there?</i>

04:52.392 --> 04:55.928
There was a sinkhole and I fell in.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.164
Sinkholes are fairly common
after a big storm, Your Highness.

04:59.199 --> 05:02.178
- You don't say.
- Don't worry, Dad.

05:02.213 --> 05:04.236
We'll find a way to get
both of you outta there.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.871
How hard can it be?

05:05.905 --> 05:08.974
I got down here
easy enough. Sheesh.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.909
Ono, fly down and take a look.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.945
Affirmative!
I'll see what I can see.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.114
Greetings, Your Majesty.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.984
- Eh, just call me Bunga!
- Hello, Ono.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.186
Kion wanted me to check
things out down here.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.188
And what do you see?

05:23.223 --> 05:26.992
Uh...
looks like you're stuck in a hole?

05:27.026 --> 05:30.896
Yes. That's what it
looks like to me, too.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.198
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
Kion will think of something.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.067
He always does.

05:38.104 --> 05:41.073
Ono, report! Any roots
they can grab hold of?

05:41.107 --> 05:43.242
Rocks they can climb?
Anything?

05:43.276 --> 05:48.080
Unfortunately, no.
It's just a deep hole with no way out.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.948
And the walls
are kind of crumbly.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.187
I'd, uh, appreciate it if you
didn't send me down there again.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.923
Oh... Okay, Ono.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.893
How deep is it?
Can I see? Whoa!

06:00.927 --> 06:02.593
Everyone, get back!

06:05.165 --> 06:06.899
Kiara!

06:06.933 --> 06:08.066
<i> Huwezi!</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:13.939
Kiara, are you all right?

06:13.973 --> 06:17.810
- Yeah, thanks to you, Fuli.
- Happy to do it.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.045
Okay.
Everyone needs to stay back.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.948
Kion's right.
These sinkholes can get wider.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.317
And we don't want
anyone else to fall in.

06:25.351 --> 06:29.087
Yeah. It's bad enough Dad and
Bunga are stuck down there.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.223
Well, at least they have
each other.

06:31.257 --> 06:34.293
Hmm. I got it!
We dig our way out.

06:34.327 --> 06:38.297
Bunga, you can dig your way
into a hole. But not out.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.933
I know!
We fill the hole with water

06:40.967 --> 06:44.136
and then float up to the top!
Got any water?

06:44.170 --> 06:46.205
That's a terrible idea, Bunga.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.241
<i>You have to think
before you act!</i>

06:49.275 --> 06:52.211
Doesn't sound like Bunga and
Dad are getting along, does it?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.279
No, it doesn't.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.916
- But I'm not exactly surprised.
- What do you mean?

06:57.951 --> 07:01.987
Well, Bunga is a good friend,
and very brave.

07:02.021 --> 07:06.158
- But he can be... trying.
- Trying?

07:06.192 --> 07:12.064
Yeah, as in Dad's trying
not to let Bunga drive him crazy.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.867
I know Bunga can be
kind of stubborn,

07:15.902 --> 07:19.071
but he's my best friend.
And Dad...

07:19.105 --> 07:21.677
Can also be a bit stubborn.

07:21.712 --> 07:23.141
<i>No, no, no.
This'll totally work.</i>

07:23.176 --> 07:26.945
I climb on top of you and then
you jump as high as you can.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.314
Then, when you're mid-air,
I jump off of you

07:29.349 --> 07:31.950
and right out
of the hole! Ready?

07:31.985 --> 07:35.320
You are not climbing on me!

07:35.355 --> 07:38.223
Well, yeah, not if you keep
moving around like that.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.025
Bunga, no!

07:40.059 --> 07:42.327
 Okay. Fine.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.997
I'll just climb
up there myself.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.165
Just need a running start.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.003
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

07:53.139 --> 07:55.107
Bunga, I wouldn't do that
if I were you...

07:55.141 --> 07:56.208
Whoa!

07:56.242 --> 07:57.209
Oh, no.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.344
Dad!

07:59.379 --> 08:00.846
- Simba!
- Daddy!

08:00.880 --> 08:01.980
Little B!
Bunga!

08:03.983 --> 08:05.217
I don't see them.

08:12.091 --> 08:15.093
Bunga? 
Bunga!

08:15.128 --> 08:19.031
Wow!
It was really dark under there!

08:20.300 --> 08:24.002
See what happens
when you don't think first?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.304
Eh. I'm okay.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.307
Dad? Bunga?
What happened?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.942
Bunga tried to climb the wall.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.977
'Cause I'm such a good climber!

08:33.011 --> 08:35.147
Sure, when you're
climbing trees!

08:35.181 --> 08:39.866
Climbing trees. Hmm...
I have an idea.

08:39.902 --> 08:43.207
Lion Guard, you're with me.
Be right back, Mom!

08:44.222 --> 08:47.225
Simba! Kion's got a plan
to get you out.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.094
Just hang in there.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.129
I don't have a choice.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.899
But that doesn't mean
that you have to stay here.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.334
What do you mean?

08:55.368 --> 08:58.609
You and Kiara should go on
to the elephants' concert.

08:58.711 --> 09:01.973
- We're already late.
- But they're expecting all of us.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.275
What about tradition?

09:03.309 --> 09:05.877
The elephants will be honored
to have at least

09:05.912 --> 09:08.180
some of the royal family
in attendance.

09:08.214 --> 09:12.017
But if none of us show up,
they'll be worried.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.053
Simba, I'm more worried
about you.

09:15.088 --> 09:19.958
I'm fine, Nala.
I'm just stuck in a hole.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.828
Kion and the Lion Guard
will get me out.

09:22.862 --> 09:25.230
But royal duties
must not be ignored.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.232
Okay, we'll go.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.901
And hopefully, Kion will
have you out of there soon.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.971
Yes. The sooner, the better.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.306
Looking good.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.007
Just keep going straight.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.946
That's it! We're there!

09:40.980 --> 09:44.916
Dad, Bunga. We're gonna tip
this tree down into the hole.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.151
Then you can just climb up.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.086
Great idea, Kion!

09:48.121 --> 09:52.991
Hey wait. When Kion suggests
climbing, it's a great idea?

09:53.025 --> 09:54.059
But when I suggest...

09:54.093 --> 09:56.862
Bunga, just take cover.

09:56.896 --> 09:57.963
Right!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.936
All right, Lion Guard.
We're ready.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.905
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

10:08.107 --> 10:09.074
Whoa!

10:18.351 --> 10:21.949
- Bunga?
- I didn't hurt anybody, did I?

10:23.122 --> 10:25.991
That didn't work as well
as I thought it would.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.325
Good try anyway, Kion.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.163
Good try?
You kidding? It's perfect!

10:31.197 --> 10:34.332
Just look at all these bugs!
Mmm.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.102
Hey, look at that!
A hole!

10:37.136 --> 10:40.305
Hmm. It must've opened
when the tree hit.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.941
And there's a tunnel!

10:42.975 --> 10:45.911
Simba! This is it!
Our way out!

10:45.945 --> 10:47.078
Bunga, wait.

10:47.113 --> 10:50.348
We have no idea
where this tunnel leads.

10:50.383 --> 10:54.085
Unless... It might be
part of Nandembo Caverns.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.288
The Caverns do turn
in this direction.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.323
The entrance isn't
too far from here.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.926
Dad, if you and Bunga
go through the tunnel,

11:00.960 --> 11:02.928
I'll take the Guard
into the Caverns.

11:02.962 --> 11:05.063
With any luck, we'll
meet you in the middle!

11:05.097 --> 11:06.965
Okay! Let's go!

11:06.999 --> 11:09.420
- Be careful!
- I will.

11:09.455 --> 11:12.070
Bunga, on the other hand...
not so sure.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.940
Hey, Simba!
You comin' or not?

11:15.374 --> 11:18.076
Oh, boy.

11:18.110 --> 11:21.246
Lion Guard, let's head to
Nandembo Caverns.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.016
Uh, Kion? You know those
caves can be pretty tricky.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.152
I'm not really used to
navigating from below.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.954
Ono's right, Kion.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.223
Nandembo Caverns
are a twisty maze.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.992
We could get totally lost
down there.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.328
Yeah. Hippos aren't
exactly experts

11:36.362 --> 11:38.029
when it comes to tunnels.

11:38.064 --> 11:41.933
Hmm. But we do know someone
who is an expert at tunnels!

11:41.968 --> 11:43.335
Of course!
I'll go get him.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.003
Meet us at the Caverns!

11:45.037 --> 11:47.138
Affirmative.

11:47.173 --> 11:50.342
Come on, Simba!
Ya gotta keep up!

11:50.376 --> 11:53.912
Doing my best, Bunga.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.214
Well, hurry up.
Squeeze faster.

11:56.249 --> 12:00.185
Yeah! Now we're
gettin' somewhere!

12:01.053 --> 12:02.187
Oh.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.324
 Bunga.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.227
We need to talk
about which way to go.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.296
Why talk when you can walk?

12:11.330 --> 12:13.298
Bunga, wait!

12:13.332 --> 12:15.133
You need to stop and think!

12:15.167 --> 12:19.137
You can't just pick a random
tunnel and expect it to lead out!

12:19.171 --> 12:21.139
I know what I'm doing.

12:22.341 --> 12:24.242
Or maybe I don't.

12:24.277 --> 12:30.148
Bunga, please. Just stop
and listen to me for once.

12:30.182 --> 12:35.287
Fine, fine. You decide.
Which way do we go?

12:35.321 --> 12:37.055
Well, okay.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.992
I think we should go down
the largest tunnel.

12:41.027 --> 12:44.195
- It's the most likely to lead to the...
- Nah!

12:44.230 --> 12:47.098
We should go down this tunnel!
Duh.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.335
Did you just say "duh" to me?

12:50.369 --> 12:54.339
Uh, no, no.
I was just, uh, singing!

12:54.373 --> 12:59.077
<i> # Duh-duh, duh-duh,
da-da-duh-duh #</i>

12:59.111 --> 13:02.013
You do remember who you're
talking to, don't you?

13:02.048 --> 13:04.249
I know who you are.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.218
You're Simba! You're my
best friend's dad.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.021
I'm also the King!

13:18.030 --> 13:22.167
No going back now.
Thanks to someone's cave in.

13:22.201 --> 13:25.615
Well, you caused
a cave in, too. Back in...

13:25.702 --> 13:28.173
- In the hole.
- Yeah, o-o-okay.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.275
But I was trying to get out.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.911
It wasn't 'cause
I got all mad.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.213
Of course I got mad.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.283
Do you have any idea
how annoying it is

13:38.317 --> 13:41.219
to be trapped with you
and your crazy ideas?

13:41.253 --> 13:44.956
Crazy ideas? Crazy ideas?

13:44.991 --> 13:48.026
You're right.
I'm full of crazy ideas!

13:48.060 --> 13:49.995
And I just had another one.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.130
How about you go down
your tunnel,

13:52.164 --> 13:54.165
and I'll go down mine.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.003
Then you won't have to put up
with me and my crazy ideas anymore.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.070
Fine!

14:00.206 --> 14:03.074
See? I knew this tunnel
would be easy going.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.910
Starting to get
a little cramped.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.046
But I think we can fit,
Your Highness.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.048
Just as long as we...

14:10.082 --> 14:13.918
Oh, yeah.
It's just me now. Fine.

14:15.254 --> 14:18.156
So nice to finally
hear myself think.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.227
Looks like I was right.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.229
This has to be the way out.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.931
But if this is the right
way out,

14:26.966 --> 14:30.068
Bunga's going the wrong way.

14:30.102 --> 14:31.169
And annoying or not,

14:31.203 --> 14:33.038
he is Kion's best friend.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.907
And my subject.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.176
I can't let him stay lost
down here.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.147
If Simba had just listened to me,

14:42.181 --> 14:44.049
I bet we'd be
outta here by now.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.019
That you Simba?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.988
Change your mind?

14:50.022 --> 14:52.090
Huh. Falling rocks.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.925
Oh, well. No worries.

How'd you know my uncle's song?

15:39.238 --> 15:41.272
I knew it before you did.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.309
They sang it to me all the
time when I was growing up.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.261
Oh, right! They raised you.

15:46.262 --> 15:51.015
Just like they raised me.
That kind of makes us...

15:51.050 --> 15:55.220
- Brothers? Sort of?
- I never thought of it that way.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.022
But, I guess it sort of does.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.893
I'm, uh, sorry I yelled at you,
bro.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.829
That's King bro to you.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.168
Too bad Timon
and Pumbaa aren't here

16:10.202 --> 16:12.928
to see us finally getting along.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.174
- It would make them happy.
- You know them.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.244
<i> Hakuna matata?
They're always happy!</i>

16:19.278 --> 16:24.849
Why? Why?!
Oh, cruel savannah!

16:24.884 --> 16:28.853
To take both our babies
on the same day?

16:28.888 --> 16:31.256
I know, Timon. I know!

16:31.290 --> 16:35.026
Fate is a fickle mongoose!

16:35.060 --> 16:38.062
Remind me again. Huh.
Why did you bring them here?

16:38.097 --> 16:40.064
I thought Timon could help.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.901
Meerkats are supposed
to be great in tunnels.

16:42.935 --> 16:47.305
And now we're lost in this crazy maze.

16:47.339 --> 16:53.077
Oh, I'm so turned around I'm
afraid we'll never get out alive!

16:53.112 --> 16:55.246
Uh, Timon, Pumbaa?

16:55.281 --> 16:58.754
The entrance to the cave
is right there.

16:59.985 --> 17:04.088
See? Barely inside
and we're already lost!

17:04.123 --> 17:06.891
Not exactly inspiring
confidence, are they?

17:06.925 --> 17:09.294
They're just worried
about Bunga and Simba, Ono.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.996
My kids! Who knows

17:11.997 --> 17:16.000
what horrors they're
enduring down there.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.068
<i>- Hakuna...
- Matata.</i>

17:17.203 --> 17:18.770
<i>- Hakuna...
- Matata.</i>

17:18.904 --> 17:19.938
<i>- Hakuna...
- Matata.</i>

17:20.172 --> 17:21.940
<i>- Hakuna...
- Matata.</i>

17:22.907 --> 17:24.843
We should think about this.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.845
Which way, Your Majesty?

17:26.878 --> 17:30.181
Please. You choose, Bunga.
I insist.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.917
Nah. You're the King.
You choose.

17:32.952 --> 17:36.955
I am the King.
And I say you choose.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.290
<i>Why? Oh, why?</i>

17:39.325 --> 17:42.026
- That sounded like...
- Timon?

17:42.061 --> 17:45.930
<i>My two babies!
Lost in these accursed caverns! </i>

17:45.965 --> 17:47.165
- Forever!
- It came from down here!

17:47.199 --> 17:50.902
- So what are we waiting for?
- Wait for me!

17:50.936 --> 17:53.071
Sorry, I lost it back there, Kion.

17:53.105 --> 17:57.075
Oh, you'll understand when
you have kids of your own.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.043
Well, not exactly your own.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.147
But you'll understand when a
lost lion or lonely honey badger

18:03.182 --> 18:06.251
wanders into your little
corner of the world.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.286
And you let 'em into your heart,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.922
you know, just enough, and...

18:10.956 --> 18:14.058
And then...

18:15.327 --> 18:17.862
- Uncle Pumbaa?
- Timon!

18:17.897 --> 18:21.266
Ooh, I can still hear
their sweet, sweet voices.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.270
Dad? Bunga?

18:25.304 --> 18:26.871
<i>Kion!</i>

18:27.873 --> 18:30.174
My babies are alive!

18:30.209 --> 18:35.313
Don't worry, Simba and Bunga!
We're comin' for ya!

18:35.347 --> 18:37.982
 Dead end.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.085
We're still coming for ya!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.220
This way.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.990
- Kion!
- Dad! Bunga!

18:46.025 --> 18:51.896
Oh, Timon, look! See?
They're okay!

18:51.931 --> 18:54.232
Uncle Timon!
Uncle Pumbaa!

18:58.170 --> 18:59.971
<i>Hapana!</i>

19:00.005 --> 19:02.106
Should we go back?
Look for another way?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.842
I've got a better idea.
Hop on!

19:04.877 --> 19:06.044
That's your idea?

19:06.078 --> 19:09.080
Actually, it's your idea.
Remember?

19:09.114 --> 19:10.214
Oh, yeah.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.376
I don't believe it.

19:15.287 --> 19:19.123
Hang on!
Ow! Bunga, not the mane.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.936
Sorry, bro.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.835
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

19:26.966 --> 19:28.833
Did we just see...

19:28.867 --> 19:31.970
A honey badger riding
on top of the King?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.005
Like my dad always says,

19:34.039 --> 19:37.736
live long enough,
and you'll see everything.

19:37.771 --> 19:40.211
Thanks for the lift.
We should do this again sometime.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.916
Well, I'll, uh, have Zazu
check my schedule.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.055
Dad, Bunga?
I thought you guys are...

19:51.090 --> 19:54.058
- Are practically bothers?
- Huh?

19:54.093 --> 19:57.992
- Absolutely.
- And to think

19:58.027 --> 20:00.064
you were worried
that we'd never find them.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.642
I'm sorry. I should've remembered.

20:03.643 --> 20:06.590
<i>Hakuna matata!</i>

20:13.178 --> 20:15.913
Bravo! Bravo!

20:15.948 --> 20:17.915
Thank you.
Thank you.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.185
We're so glad to
have all of you here

20:21.220 --> 20:23.921
to take part in our tradition.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.957
We're especially honored

20:25.991 --> 20:29.327
to have members of the
royal family in attendance.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.262
We wouldn't miss it.

20:31.296 --> 20:34.165
The King was very disappointed
to miss this event.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.034
He planned to be here...

20:36.068 --> 20:40.204
Animals plan,
and the savannah laughs.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.274
Indeed. We're grateful
for your understanding.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.375
Sorry we're late!

20:44.410 --> 20:46.244
- Simba?
- Daddy?

20:48.280 --> 20:50.982
Your Majesty.
Kion.

20:51.950 --> 20:56.054
- And, uh...
- Bunga. Brother to the King.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.390
- Brother?
- Just call me Uncle Bunga.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.959
What exactly happened
in that pit?

21:01.994 --> 21:04.962
It was quite an adventure.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.899
Thank you for your patience,
Ma Tembo.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.301
And I thank all of you, my friends.

21:10.335 --> 21:13.271
I know how important
music is to elephants.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.941
And I'm deeply honored to be
included in your tradition.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.144
But since I missed your
only concert of the season,

21:20.179 --> 21:23.881
I'd like to share a song that
means a great deal to my family.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.284
All my family.

21:26.318 --> 21:30.154
We would be honored to hear
your song, Your Majesty.
