02:00.819 --> 02:03.655
Unfortunately,
I can't make this delivery myself.

02:05.907 --> 02:08.702
I have a reputation
with certain customs officials.

02:08.785 --> 02:10.453
But I'll be along later in the week.

02:10.537 --> 02:14.165
I don't think you'll have problems at all.
Not with Rasputin along.

02:23.967 --> 02:28.221
The United States Government is trying
very hard to get its hand on these.

02:35.186 --> 02:37.563
The most perfect plates ever created
for $100 bills.

04:14.201 --> 04:16.161
I'm sorry, ma'am, they are not ready yet.

04:16.245 --> 04:19.790
Mr. O'Hanlon, you promised me
the shoes would be ready by tonight.

04:19.873 --> 04:22.793
I should have taken them
to a more reliable repairman.

04:22.876 --> 04:26.171
That you should have, ma'am.
Because I'm not a shoe repairman.

04:26.255 --> 04:29.633
I'm a cobbler, an expert craftsman,
that cannot be rushed in his work.

04:29.716 --> 04:33.761
I came here because my granddaughter
insisted you needed the business.

04:33.844 --> 04:37.682
I need nothing from the likes of you,
especially it being so close to Christmas.

04:37.765 --> 04:40.476
- Give me my shoes back.
- Take them and be gone.

04:40.643 --> 04:42.103
Come on, Lisa.

04:42.853 --> 04:44.355
Wait, Grandma.

04:49.568 --> 04:52.613
I can't hear. I can't hear anything.

04:52.738 --> 04:55.157
- No tricks tonight, Lisa.
- What?

04:55.699 --> 04:58.494
I can't hear you. Really.

05:00.496 --> 05:02.373
All right. Let's have a look.

05:03.958 --> 05:07.503
No wonder you couldn't hear anything.
You had a coin in your ear.

05:07.586 --> 05:10.881
Go on with you.
And keep that money out of your ear.

05:12.174 --> 05:14.677
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night, my darling.

05:16.845 --> 05:19.014
A shoe repairman indeed.

05:53.131 --> 05:54.925
What're you doing?

05:55.008 --> 05:58.553
No, I'm not going in there.
No! I'm not getting in there.

06:01.348 --> 06:02.349
Let's go.

06:07.312 --> 06:10.315
It's a poor cobbler you're kidnapping.
Don't you know that?

06:10.398 --> 06:12.859
Who's kidnapping?
All we want is your gold.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.445
Gold? I haven't got any gold.

06:16.404 --> 06:19.574
- A friend of ours told us differently.
- Who might that be?

06:19.658 --> 06:22.786
Just hang on, my lad.
You'll be finding out soon enough.

06:23.370 --> 06:26.790
That's not bad.
You ought to try out for The Gong Show.

06:31.878 --> 06:33.046
What the...

06:36.716 --> 06:39.552
- He's disappeared.
- He's gone. I don't believe it.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.847
- Where did he go?
- How do I know?

06:56.277 --> 07:00.156
United British Airways
flight number seven from New York...

07:00.239 --> 07:03.743
is now arriving at gate number 22.

07:07.622 --> 07:09.290
Passenger Richard Alexander...

07:09.374 --> 07:10.666
Flight to Washington.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.085
...Richard Alexander...

07:12.168 --> 07:15.963
please report to New Continental Airlines
flight desk.

07:20.927 --> 07:24.931
Last call for Trans European
flight number 10...

07:25.097 --> 07:28.392
now boarding at gate number 16.

07:34.690 --> 07:38.152
American International flight number four
from San Francisco...

07:39.737 --> 07:43.824
is now arriving at gate number 31.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.041
United British Airways flight number...

08:55.228 --> 08:57.397
Your travels are over, Charlie.

09:07.282 --> 09:09.785
- Where are the plates?
- They're on the dog.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.704
In the vest.
But you are too late, Wonder Woman.

09:30.512 --> 09:33.390
I can't believe some runt of an old man
got the best of you.

09:33.474 --> 09:35.267
We can't believe it either, Mr. Bonelli.

09:35.351 --> 09:37.186
He just disappeared.

09:37.353 --> 09:38.729
The next time...

09:38.812 --> 09:40.856
you better be more careful. Got that?

09:40.939 --> 09:43.442
Listen, why don't we
forget about O'Hanlon?

09:43.525 --> 09:45.694
He's just a poor old shoemaker anyway.

09:45.778 --> 09:48.614
That poor old shoemaker
has got a hoard of gold somewhere.

09:48.697 --> 09:51.909
And I need all the gold I can get
to buy those counterfeit plates.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.161
$1,500,000 worth.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.460
We've only got until Wednesday.

10:01.752 --> 10:04.296
If we blow this deal with Thackery...

10:04.796 --> 10:07.466
we'll all gonna be getting funerals
for Christmas.

10:07.549 --> 10:10.052
Okay. So what do you want us
to do about it?

10:10.135 --> 10:13.472
We hit O'Hanlon again.
And this time we make it good.

10:15.474 --> 10:16.725
In two days...

10:16.808 --> 10:20.729
I'm gonna be the guy dishing out
the funerals, and making people sweat.

10:22.814 --> 10:25.650
No one's gonna stop me
from getting those plates.

10:25.942 --> 10:29.112
Especially not some stupid old shoemaker.

11:16.284 --> 11:20.204
Lisa, you gave me a fright.
You mustn't sneak up on me like that.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.372
I'm sorry.

11:24.042 --> 11:25.543
Is this a new game?

11:26.252 --> 11:30.048
I've got to go away, darling.
There's some bad men who're after me.

11:30.131 --> 11:32.008
Do they want your gold?

11:36.679 --> 11:39.015
You're never to mention my gold again.
You hear me?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.141
You had no business...

11:40.224 --> 11:42.477
peeking in the basement of my shop
like you did.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.896
It was a mistake
you ever found out about my gold.

11:44.979 --> 11:48.232
I didn't mean to see it.
And I'm really sorry, Pat.

11:49.066 --> 11:52.111
I want your solemn word
you'll never mention my gold again.

11:52.194 --> 11:55.406
I promised before.
I won't tell anyone. Ever.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.909
All right, fine. Now, be gone.
I've got work to do.

12:03.873 --> 12:04.999
Hey, Pat...

12:06.083 --> 12:09.086
- I can't hear anything.
- No, I have no time, Lisa.

12:10.421 --> 12:13.799
- Aren't you gonna check my ears?
- Lisa, I don't have time.

12:21.432 --> 12:24.101
Okay. Goodbye, Pat.

12:37.948 --> 12:39.616
Lisa, darling.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.919
Thackery pulled a switch on me, Steve.

12:51.003 --> 12:55.048
I caught up with Courier, but not before
he got the plates on the plane.

12:55.299 --> 12:57.593
- What flight?
- Global Air, Flight 183.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.762
Arrives in Washington at 10:25 a. m.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.806
183, we'll be there.

13:03.473 --> 13:06.935
Yeah, there's one more thing, Steve.
The plates are on a dog.

13:07.603 --> 13:08.854
On a...

13:09.271 --> 13:10.397
A dog?

13:10.772 --> 13:13.358
One of Thackery's attack dogs.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.462
Easy, boy, easy now.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.485
Seal off all the exits.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.206
Mr. Bonelli, I presume?

15:35.290 --> 15:38.126
That's right.
Welcome to Washington, Mr. Thackery.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.712
This really is a nifty idea.

15:40.795 --> 15:44.173
It doesn't do to be too far from
one's point of departure.

15:44.257 --> 15:48.678
Good thinking. The boys and I have taken
accommodation just down the road.

15:52.306 --> 15:53.391
Nice.

15:53.474 --> 15:56.978
- His Majesty's Light Horse Brigade.
- I saw the movie.

15:57.437 --> 15:59.897
Cannons to the right. Cannons to the left.

16:00.898 --> 16:02.316
You collect these?

16:03.025 --> 16:04.610
In a manner of speaking.

16:04.694 --> 16:07.822
Only, when mine reach London
they won't be lead...

16:08.364 --> 16:09.991
they'll be gold.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.910
I get it.

16:14.203 --> 16:18.624
You're gonna melt the gold down,
and pass it through as toy soldiers.

16:18.708 --> 16:19.834
That's fantastic.

16:19.917 --> 16:21.335
Mr. Bonelli...

16:21.419 --> 16:25.256
they told me in London
that you weren't a really big operator.

16:25.381 --> 16:28.843
You had no leverage, you couldn't handle
a really big job. True?

16:28.926 --> 16:32.638
Let's wait and see how this operation
works out first. Okay, Mr. Thackery?

16:32.721 --> 16:36.183
You want the gold and I want the plates.
It's that simple.

16:36.267 --> 16:38.727
We're to meet Wednesday
for the exchange.

16:39.270 --> 16:41.730
The quicker this business is over,
the better for me.

16:41.814 --> 16:45.401
There is one thing, though.
I need another 24 hours.

16:45.484 --> 16:49.154
It would make things a lot easier
if we can deliver it on Thursday.

16:51.782 --> 16:54.535
Are you saying you don't have the gold?

16:54.618 --> 16:56.287
No. I have access to it.

16:56.370 --> 17:00.040
It's just that it'd make things easier
if I can deliver it on Thursday.

17:00.124 --> 17:02.710
Mr. Bonelli,
as these gentlemen will attest...

17:02.793 --> 17:05.963
I've gone to great risk
in coming to this country.

17:06.046 --> 17:09.049
I didn't do so to be lied to
or trifled with.

17:09.842 --> 17:12.845
You've got it all wrong, Mr. Thackery.
Everything's ready.

17:12.928 --> 17:15.097
Wednesday, Mr. Bonelli.

17:16.515 --> 17:19.142
Okay. You've got it. Wednesday.

17:20.185 --> 17:22.061
Very good.

17:24.439 --> 17:27.901
Hush and be done with you.
"Where're my shoes, Mr. O'Hanlon?

17:27.984 --> 17:30.404
"Why aren't you working today,
Mr. O'Hanlon?

17:30.487 --> 17:33.365
"An irresponsible old man,
that's what you are, Mr. O'Hanlon. "

17:33.448 --> 17:35.993
I can't stand here
listening to that sound any longer.

17:36.076 --> 17:38.078
I won't be caged up with that.

17:41.498 --> 17:43.166
Going somewhere, Mr. O'Hanlon?

17:43.250 --> 17:46.211
First, it's kidnapping.
Now it's breaking and entering, is it?

17:46.294 --> 17:48.922
You'll be getting coal in your stockings
this Christmas.

17:49.005 --> 17:50.507
Your gold, old man.

17:51.675 --> 17:53.802
Send help here right away, please.

17:54.427 --> 17:57.639
Like he said, the gold, old man.

17:59.641 --> 18:02.352
Why do you think I've got any gold?

18:03.353 --> 18:05.939
We hit a very prominent
gold exchange outfit.

18:06.606 --> 18:09.776
And your name,
followed by several five-digit numbers...

18:10.318 --> 18:12.612
was on their preferred-customers list.

18:12.696 --> 18:15.490
You can't have my gold.
You'll have to take my life first.

18:15.573 --> 18:18.618
Maxwell, take him in the back
and use the silencer.

18:18.702 --> 18:20.995
And you, start tearing this place apart.

18:21.079 --> 18:22.455
No, wait.

18:24.666 --> 18:26.292
I'll take you to the gold.

18:26.376 --> 18:27.794
No tricks, old man.

18:28.294 --> 18:30.797
I'm not taking my eyes,
or this gun, off you...

18:30.880 --> 18:32.632
till we see that gold.

18:33.258 --> 18:36.010
No tricks. It's at my shop.
In the basement.

19:08.751 --> 19:11.671
Jackpot. Okay, gentlemen, bring it up.

19:16.092 --> 19:18.678
I never look a gift horse in the mouth,
old man.

19:18.761 --> 19:22.682
That's why I'm not gonna ask you
how in the world you acquired all this.

19:23.015 --> 19:25.351
Or why in the world you haven't spent it?

19:25.434 --> 19:26.936
Let's go. Bring it up.

19:34.776 --> 19:37.862
We'll take this upstairs
and wait for you, Mr. B.

19:38.196 --> 19:40.490
Please. Can I get out of here now, too?

19:41.616 --> 19:44.536
What's the matter, old man?
Don't you like my company?

19:44.619 --> 19:46.579
It's the basement I don't like.

19:46.996 --> 19:50.208
Dark and secluded places
never did sit well with me.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.043
That's just too bad.

19:53.002 --> 19:56.214
Because I don't know
what else I can do with you...

19:57.715 --> 19:59.259
except leave you down here.

19:59.342 --> 20:01.386
Please, Mr. Bonelli, don't do that.

20:01.469 --> 20:04.430
Use your gun, anything,
but please don't lock me up.

20:54.105 --> 20:56.107
- I'm back.
- You look beat.

20:56.190 --> 20:57.983
I know. I am.

20:59.109 --> 21:01.111
I'll never make a jet setter, Steve.

21:01.195 --> 21:03.051
What's the latest on Thackery?

21:03.052 --> 21:04.907
Immigration says he's
still in the country.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.284
I've got something
that's gonna lead us to him.

21:07.368 --> 21:09.328
- Great. What is it?
- Gold robberies...

21:09.411 --> 21:11.288
about a dozen of them in the past month...

21:11.372 --> 21:13.999
apparently done by
the same person or persons.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.209
I get it.

21:15.459 --> 21:19.963
Thackery never negotiates for currency,
only precious metals or jewels.

21:20.047 --> 21:23.592
Whoever's been stealing the gold
plans to buy the counterfeit plates.

21:23.676 --> 21:26.512
Find the gold thief,
chances are you'll find Thackery.

21:27.304 --> 21:29.014
It sounds good on paper, Steve...

21:29.098 --> 21:32.434
but do you think this person or persons
will try it again?

21:32.559 --> 21:35.354
It's a long shot,
but we've arranged for a decoy.

21:35.479 --> 21:38.607
A jewelry corporation is transferring
a small amount of gold...

21:38.690 --> 21:39.733
this afternoon at 4:30.

21:39.816 --> 21:42.945
Our people made sure
the news got on the grapevine.

21:43.654 --> 21:45.697
Midland Security Transports.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.668
What's a few more hours without sleep?

22:00.170 --> 22:01.671
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

22:01.797 --> 22:03.382
- Have a good time.
- I will.

22:11.848 --> 22:15.852
Yeah, that's right. Like I said before
I want no foul-ups on your end.

22:19.481 --> 22:20.607
Yeah.

22:24.402 --> 22:25.528
Okay.

22:26.154 --> 22:27.614
Yeah. We got it.

22:28.198 --> 22:29.908
They're working a run as scheduled.

22:29.991 --> 22:32.702
- You got the uniforms?
- Yeah. But why the extra job?

22:32.786 --> 22:35.789
I thought all we needed to pay Thackery
was the Irishman's gold.

22:35.872 --> 22:38.041
Deal with Thackery,
you've gotta be adaptable.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.127
- Raucher, you ready?
- It'll be as good as the real thing, Mr. B.

22:41.211 --> 22:42.879
Figure it out for yourself, Maxwell.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.216
In two weeks, tonight's gold
won't be worth what it was yesterday.

22:46.299 --> 22:47.550
I don't get it.

22:47.842 --> 22:49.969
Thackery's discounting our gold.

22:50.929 --> 22:53.139
You two guys get the doors, let's go.

22:56.559 --> 22:59.437
As soon as you finish with that,
you better get changed.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.232
You guys have got less than an hour.
Pick it up.

23:27.799 --> 23:30.092
- Just can't get over it.
- What's that?

23:30.176 --> 23:34.513
- A woman being an agent with the AIDC.
- It's the IADC.

23:34.597 --> 23:37.308
- What? You don't approve?
- Sure.

23:38.309 --> 23:41.520
It's just gonna take some time
to get used to it.

23:41.604 --> 23:44.690
- Don't take too much time, Gino.
- Why not?

23:45.107 --> 23:47.234
You might get replaced. By a woman.

23:52.239 --> 23:54.700
That's one of our trucks. We better stop.

23:59.580 --> 24:02.416
- You have problem here?
- You do.

24:02.583 --> 24:05.085
Hold it, sweetheart. Come on out.

24:12.301 --> 24:14.637
Right back there. Move.

24:21.769 --> 24:23.062
Open the door.

24:25.481 --> 24:26.606
Let's go.

24:29.442 --> 24:30.943
Now get in.

24:42.455 --> 24:43.915
Okay, let's go.

24:51.464 --> 24:53.549
You're gonna do exactly as we say...

24:53.633 --> 24:57.094
or your family's gonna have
a very unmerry Christmas this year.

25:33.839 --> 25:36.467
Thieves! They're stealing the gold!
Stop them!

25:38.135 --> 25:39.178
Halt!

25:41.138 --> 25:42.222
Come on!

25:55.194 --> 25:56.904
Now, back up.

26:11.084 --> 26:12.169
Move it!

26:16.048 --> 26:17.674
Come back.

27:30.705 --> 27:33.249
- He won't get out of the way.
- Run him down.

27:45.428 --> 27:48.931
- Are you all right?
- What did you do that for?

27:49.265 --> 27:52.768
- I just saved your life.
- You let them get away is what you did.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.605
Interfering women.

28:00.318 --> 28:01.736
Thank you very much, miss.

28:01.819 --> 28:02.862
- May I come in?
- No.

28:02.945 --> 28:04.196
Mr. O'Hanlon.

28:04.447 --> 28:08.492
Look, miss, I told the police
and Wonder Woman everything I know.

28:08.576 --> 28:12.163
You didn't tell her what you were doing
in the back of that truck.

28:12.955 --> 28:16.792
I was going to rent the truck
and I accidentally locked myself in...

28:18.919 --> 28:21.464
How would you know
what I told Wonder Woman?

28:21.547 --> 28:23.924
- Pat, you're back.
- Lisa, my darling.

28:24.258 --> 28:25.342
Hi.

28:25.593 --> 28:27.887
So, you know nothing about those men?

28:28.012 --> 28:31.265
- Like I said-
- Those men didn't catch you after all.

28:31.390 --> 28:32.850
- What men?
- Well...

28:33.350 --> 28:37.229
It's just a little game we play.
Isn't it, Lisa? Not now, darling.

28:37.813 --> 28:41.775
Yeah, Pat's right.
I was just playing our little game.

28:41.942 --> 28:45.029
Yeah. Listen, why don't you run along.
I'll talk to you later.

28:45.112 --> 28:47.281
Missy, thank you very much for the ride.

28:47.364 --> 28:48.907
- Yes.
- Goodbye.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.785
Lisa, are you really good friends
with Pat?

28:55.820 --> 28:57.690
Oh, yes.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.878
I like to think so.

29:01.462 --> 29:03.672
But I'm sometimes not sure about him.

29:05.174 --> 29:09.970
If you really care about him, you'll tell me
about those men who wanted to hurt him.

29:10.137 --> 29:11.638
But I promised not to.

29:11.722 --> 29:14.182
You don't want to see Pat get hurt,
do you?

29:14.516 --> 29:17.436
Are you a policeman?
I mean, policeperson?

29:18.895 --> 29:20.522
Well, sort of.

29:23.317 --> 29:25.402
Some men tried to take Pat's gold.

29:28.237 --> 29:30.781
- How much gold does he have?
- A lot.

29:31.198 --> 29:34.368
He has a big old-fashioned pot of it,
filled to the brim.

29:34.702 --> 29:36.620
I saw it by mistake once.

29:37.830 --> 29:40.166
I shouldn't tell you this, but...

29:41.709 --> 29:45.296
I think Pat's a leprechaun.
They always have a pot of gold.

29:46.046 --> 29:47.464
A leprechaun?

29:48.173 --> 29:51.677
Forget it. I was just playing
another little dumb game.

29:54.680 --> 29:57.391
You won't tell Pat I said that, will you?

29:57.474 --> 29:59.393
No, I won't say a thing.

29:59.643 --> 30:02.354
And I promise,
I won't let anyone hurt him, either.

30:02.604 --> 30:03.689
Okay?

30:13.365 --> 30:16.660
- Patrick O'Hanlon has a shoe shop where?
- Eighty-first.

30:16.785 --> 30:20.164
I'd like a full rundown on him
first thing in the morning, Ira.

30:20.539 --> 30:22.291
As you wish, Diana Prince.

30:23.208 --> 30:25.878
- You think O'Hanlon's hiding something?
- Yeah.

30:26.420 --> 30:28.797
- A pot of gold.
- A what?

30:29.256 --> 30:32.050
Steve, what do you know
about leprechauns?

30:32.134 --> 30:35.387
The wee people.
My grandmother told me all about them.

30:36.221 --> 30:38.056
It's an old Irish myth.

30:38.390 --> 30:41.685
Magical little men
who've been given a pot of gold to guard.

30:41.810 --> 30:44.187
Ifyou capture one,
he must give up his gold.

30:44.271 --> 30:46.690
And he has to get it back all by himself.

30:46.940 --> 30:50.527
But if you take your eyes off him,
the leprechaun will disappear.

30:51.528 --> 30:52.821
Why do you ask?

30:52.988 --> 30:56.867
There's a little girl
who thinks that O'Hanlon's a leprechaun.

30:57.409 --> 30:58.660
Pure fantasy.

30:59.578 --> 31:03.206
As much fantasy, perhaps,
as Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor.

31:05.584 --> 31:06.710
Right.

31:10.505 --> 31:13.633
Gold's crated, all ready to roll,
Mr. Bonelli. But that old man-

31:13.717 --> 31:15.802
He must've hid in the truck
while we were here.

31:15.885 --> 31:19.013
- He knows where we are.
- I'm not worried about O'Hanlon.

31:19.264 --> 31:23.518
He's got something to hide or he would've
gone to the police long before this.

31:23.601 --> 31:26.980
But if he shows up again kill him.

33:47.494 --> 33:51.123
You just let us know where
you want the transaction to take place.

33:51.706 --> 33:53.083
Fine, we're on our way.

34:08.014 --> 34:10.559
All right, go on, back up, the both of you.

34:13.061 --> 34:16.481
- You're making one big mistake, O'Hanlon.
- Not me, boy-o.

34:16.606 --> 34:20.360
I'm not the one making the mistake,
you are, tangling with the likes of me.

34:20.443 --> 34:22.195
I'll just take what's mine and be gone.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.862
I don't think Mr. Raucher is going
to let you do that.

34:24.947 --> 34:26.824
Aren't you the sly one?

34:27.366 --> 34:29.201
I'm not as big a fool as you think.

34:29.743 --> 34:31.036
I lost O'Hanlon.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.498
One minute his car was right in front
of me, the next minute it was gone.

34:34.581 --> 34:36.708
You'd better put out an all-points bulletin.

34:36.792 --> 34:40.254
That's not good news, Diana.
Right now we need any lead we can get.

34:40.337 --> 34:43.632
Thackery's apparently made arrangements
to leave the country tonight.

34:43.715 --> 34:44.841
Tonight?

34:45.217 --> 34:48.553
Which means he'll be passing
those counterfeit plates off today.

34:48.637 --> 34:52.599
And must have figured out a clever way
of moving the gold back to England.

34:53.350 --> 34:56.561
It's rumored that there is a cheap hood
named Vincent Bonelli...

34:56.645 --> 35:00.023
who's negotiating a gold deal
that's going to put him in the big time.

35:00.107 --> 35:01.191
Bonelli?

35:01.900 --> 35:03.902
He started out as a trigger boy in Philly.

35:03.985 --> 35:07.823
I should think a deal with Thackery
would put him in way over his head.

35:07.906 --> 35:12.577
In any case, if a hood like that gets a hold
of those plates, we're in big trouble.

35:12.661 --> 35:16.414
Say no more.
I'll keep looking for Mr. O'Hanlon.

35:33.556 --> 35:36.476
Nail it up tight,
I don't want this guy getting out.

35:37.268 --> 35:40.438
All right, now get him up, let's go.
Straight back.

35:44.234 --> 35:45.735
Straight back to the door.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.404
There you go. Come on.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.576
All right, open that door now,
and lock him in.

36:00.542 --> 36:01.960
Yeah, that's it.

36:02.835 --> 36:07.006
That will get you out of my hair
and keep you out, old man.

36:07.548 --> 36:11.052
Anybody comes looking for you,
and opens that door...

36:12.470 --> 36:15.348
you're gonna meet with
a very unfortunate accident.

37:25.417 --> 37:30.339
Hey, what is this? Hello!
Where in the devil...

37:34.593 --> 37:37.179
Help! Get me out of here.

37:41.892 --> 37:44.937
Help! Somebody help me.
Get me out of here.

38:02.788 --> 38:05.666
Would you be looking for someone,
Miss Wonder Woman?

38:10.545 --> 38:13.673
As a matter of fact
I was looking for you, Mr. O'Hanlon.

38:14.216 --> 38:17.302
You thought I was one place
when actually I was somewhere else.

38:17.385 --> 38:21.014
A common enough mistake. That thief,
Bonelli, thought the same thing.

38:21.348 --> 38:24.351
- What are you doing in here?
- Getting my gold.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.646
If you had cooperated
with Diana Prince before...

38:27.812 --> 38:29.522
she might have been able to help you.

38:29.606 --> 38:31.733
Don't you bandy words with me,
Wonder Woman.

38:31.816 --> 38:35.487
You, of all people, should know the rules
under which I must operate.

38:38.406 --> 38:40.700
Do you have any idea where they went?

38:40.784 --> 38:42.869
If I knew that
do you think I'd be standing here?

38:42.952 --> 38:46.748
Mr. O'Hanlon, this is the center
of Bonelli's operations, isn't it?

38:46.831 --> 38:50.043
It is that. Would you care for a tour?
Follow me, ma'am.

38:54.798 --> 38:57.175
Here's where he conducted his business.

39:02.514 --> 39:06.226
I think I might have an idea
where Mr. Thackery is conducting his.

39:06.559 --> 39:07.727
Where's that?

39:07.810 --> 39:11.814
If we're lucky, it's near here,
and that's where the gold is headed.

39:12.482 --> 39:14.108
And so are we.

39:14.776 --> 39:17.904
By we I mean the IADC and
several squad cars, Mr. O'Hanlon.

39:17.987 --> 39:21.949
'Cause I'd like for you to call Steve Trevor
at the IADC, and...

39:40.258 --> 39:41.384
Rasputin.

39:48.391 --> 39:52.312
Pretty soon we'll be in possession
of over $1,500,000 worth of gold.

39:52.395 --> 39:54.522
As well as the counterfeit plates.

40:30.433 --> 40:32.518
- He's late.
- No, not likely, Bonelli.

40:32.602 --> 40:35.146
Because of you
it's I who am behind schedule.

40:40.943 --> 40:43.112
So let's see what you have. Get on with it.

40:43.196 --> 40:44.447
The doors, come on.

41:00.713 --> 41:01.923
This could take hours.

41:02.006 --> 41:05.134
Bonelli could be meeting Thackery
any place in the airport.

41:05.217 --> 41:06.802
Maybe we'd better split up.

41:06.886 --> 41:09.263
That's a good idea, I'll go with them.

41:09.555 --> 41:10.598
Steve.

41:20.983 --> 41:22.151
Let's go.

41:31.744 --> 41:33.037
It's all there.

41:33.704 --> 41:36.123
The question is, where are the plates?

41:36.332 --> 41:37.499
The plates?

41:37.583 --> 41:40.794
Why, they're where they've always been,
there in Rasputin's vest.

41:44.006 --> 41:45.382
Go get him, Raucher.

41:57.519 --> 41:59.813
What are you trying to pull, Thackery?

42:00.606 --> 42:03.859
It seems to me as if Rasputin doesn't
want to give up the plates.

42:03.942 --> 42:05.652
I can't say I blame him.

42:09.156 --> 42:13.535
- Shoot the dog.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

42:27.507 --> 42:31.595
Your two friends will load this gold
into that helicopter. Now.

42:35.766 --> 42:37.809
You there, old man. Stop.

42:37.934 --> 42:39.686
Hold it. Nobody moves.

42:44.274 --> 42:46.193
Everybody, drop your weapons.

42:49.362 --> 42:52.532
Pat, it's all right. Get down from there.

42:52.949 --> 42:56.036
I could've handled it myself, missy.
You're my witness.

43:01.708 --> 43:03.376
Hold it there, Thackery.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.340
Move very carefully. And very slowly.

44:37.760 --> 44:40.263
Come on now, old man,
get in here quickly.

44:41.347 --> 44:42.432
Quickly.

44:43.766 --> 44:45.685
Come on, let's get out of here.

45:06.747 --> 45:08.332
Get out!

45:20.303 --> 45:21.971
Will you put me down?

45:22.388 --> 45:25.516
I'd just as soon not make it a habit
of saving your life.

45:30.646 --> 45:32.231
Let's get out of here.

45:40.739 --> 45:43.033
What's going on? Get us out of here.

45:46.871 --> 45:48.247
Get out of here.

45:52.501 --> 45:53.961
Get us out of here.

46:30.789 --> 46:32.791
Rasputin, attack.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.587
Come on, old fellow.

46:37.879 --> 46:39.881
You know better than that. Sit.

46:49.599 --> 46:51.059
Charming puppy.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.439
Mr. O'Hanlon, how did you do that?

46:55.814 --> 46:59.109
We all have our little secrets,
don't we, Miss Wonder Woman?

47:41.234 --> 47:42.235
