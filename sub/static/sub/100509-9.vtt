00:33.408 --> 00:35.702
Outer Rim under siege!

00:35.785 --> 00:38.538
Separatist forces
have launched a major offensive.

00:38.621 --> 00:44.085
Led by the evil droid General Grievous,
Republic forces are pushed to the brink.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.338
In response to this overwhelming attack,

00:46.421 --> 00:48.798
the Jedi Council
has dispatched its Generals,

00:48.882 --> 00:53.470
sending them far from the Core Worlds
to bolster the beleaguered clones.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.555
On the distant planet of Yerbana,

00:55.638 --> 01:00.560
we find Commander Cody of the 212th
in desperate need of reinforcements.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.187
Hit the targets!

01:14.366 --> 01:16.368
Take cover! Take cover!

01:28.004 --> 01:29.464
Look out! Look out!

01:29.547 --> 01:30.757
Look out!

01:33.385 --> 01:34.803
Aim for their eyes!

01:48.858 --> 01:49.901
General!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.445
Cody, get down!

02:00.537 --> 02:03.123
Well, I can see things
are going splendidly on this front.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.583
It's no good.
We can't locate the tactical droid.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.168
He's staying out of sight.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.050
Anakin, where are you?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.301
I'm right here.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.805
What are you doing down there?

02:19.556 --> 02:22.267
We are taking cover. Now get down!

02:22.726 --> 02:23.852
You're not serious.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.354
There's only a thousand droids
down there, tops.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.774
What are you up to? Where's Captain Rex?

02:29.858 --> 02:32.861
We already finished our battle,
so we decided to come help you with yours.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.363
You're overdoing it. Again!

02:35.447 --> 02:38.241
Master, I mean no disrespect.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.660
If you want, I can hide here with you,

02:40.744 --> 02:42.912
and we can let the people in the city
suffer longer.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.539
Now, Anakin, you know I...

02:44.622 --> 02:48.293
Or we can do things my way
and help them now.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.589
All right.
I know better than to try and stop you.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.299
What's your plan this time?

02:54.382 --> 02:55.383
Stay here.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.806
One target approaching.
We can't hit it.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.767
Identify target.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.148
Cease fire.
All batteries take aim at the Jedi.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.074
Ready. Aim.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.994
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.209
I have come to surrender.

03:30.377 --> 03:35.048
Surrender? That's a relief.
Notify the tactical droid.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.300
Your forces fought valiantly,

03:37.384 --> 03:42.055
and I must admit that we are overmatched
by your superior firepower.

03:42.472 --> 03:47.727
I congratulate you, for I have fought
in many battles on many planets...

03:47.811 --> 03:50.647
always been victorious
against the droid army.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.148
Though you have always...

03:52.232 --> 03:55.485
Artoo.
How much longer are we stuck down here?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.862
Great. I'll tell the boys.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.949
All right, men.
Hang in there a little longer.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.327
Sir, yes, sir.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.580
So, it is with these thoughts in mind

04:07.664 --> 04:13.503
that I gladly surrender myself
to the mercy of the Separatist forces.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.172
Why have you ceased fire?

04:16.256 --> 04:19.592
Jedi Knight, Anakin Skywalker,
has surrendered to us, Commander.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.636
There he is.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.681
It's a trap, you fools. Open fire!

04:24.764 --> 04:26.057
Now, Artoo!

05:06.389 --> 05:07.557
General.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.143
Yes, Cody. You may join the fun as well.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.436
Yes, sir.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.646
- Blast them!
- Fire!

05:22.530 --> 05:24.699
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Move it! Move it!

05:26.493 --> 05:29.079
Bravo, Anakin. You've done it again.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.247
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.751
Your state of helplessness
really sold them on my surrender talk.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.253
Always glad to help, my friend.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.051
Skywalker here. What is it Admiral?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.928
Sir,
we've received a transmission

05:45.011 --> 05:48.723
from someone
using your subspace frequency "Fulcrum."

05:49.265 --> 05:50.517
Saw Gerrera?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.812
Perhaps the siege at Onderon
has taken a turn for the worse.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.147
No, sir, it's not Gerrera.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.150
You had best take this transmission
here on the ship.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.860
Both of you.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.290
All right, Admiral.

06:14.374 --> 06:18.169
What's so important you brought us
all the way back here?

06:25.010 --> 06:28.471
Hello, Master. It's been a while.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.355
Ah... Ahsoka. Wha...

06:39.899 --> 06:42.110
I don't believe it!
How are you?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.486
Where are you?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.113
Are... Are you okay?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.907
I'm all right. Thank you.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.993
I wish we had more time to talk,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.162
but I have urgent information
for both of you.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.164
What is it, Ahsoka?

06:54.748 --> 06:58.418
Lady Bo-Katan and I have located
the renegade Sith Lord, Maul.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.880
And if we move swiftly,
we believe we can capture him.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.521
It all makes sense now.

07:18.938 --> 07:19.939
What?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.316
If Ahsoka hadn't left the Order,

07:21.399 --> 07:23.735
then she wouldn't have been
where she needed to be.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.196
That's one way to look at it, I suppose.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.823
It's the only way to look at it.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.576
We're gonna capture Maul, finally.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.162
I thought you would be more excited
about this.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.123
I am cautiously optimistic.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.840
Ahsoka, I'm so glad...

08:26.923 --> 08:28.466
We'll have to catch up another time.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.844
Things are moving quickly.

08:30.927 --> 08:36.182
Every minute we waste here
gives Maul an opportunity to slip away.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.521
We understand. Please, follow me.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.873
Bo-Katan had been tracking
Maul's movements for several months.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.626
I was able to obtain some transmission
codes from the Pykes on Oba Diah,

09:03.710 --> 09:06.379
which helped her pinpoint
some of his previous locations.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.757
What were you doing on Oba Diah?

09:09.507 --> 09:13.094
That's a long story
and not really relevant right now.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.305
What is relevant

09:15.388 --> 09:18.475
is that we know Maul is on Mandalore
in the city of Sundari.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.645
You're certain of this?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.689
He arrived two days ago.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.567
So why not take him yourself?

09:27.650 --> 09:30.612
Or, to be more specific,
what do you want from the Republic?

09:32.781 --> 09:35.450
I don't have the numbers needed
for a siege.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.579
Without a complete lockdown of the city,
Maul will escape again.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.998
That's why
I'm proposing a joint operation.

09:42.082 --> 09:47.420
If we are successful,
you'll have Maul and I'll have Mandalore.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.927
If Republic forces aid you
in your assault,

09:54.010 --> 09:56.763
it will break treaties
that are 100 years old.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.641
We will effectively be drawn
into yet another war.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.643
What's one more?

10:03.895 --> 10:06.856
Well, we're not finished
with our first one yet.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.529
I will advise the Jedi Council
of this development.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.657
There's no time!

10:18.284 --> 10:21.413
Maul's influence on Mandalore
is destroying my people!

10:21.955 --> 10:25.208
He murdered their ruler, my sister!

10:26.292 --> 10:27.919
I thought she meant something to you!

10:31.506 --> 10:35.218
She did. And still does.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.221
But I cannot allow my feelings
to cloud my judgment.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.850
The council will decide
what our course of action will be.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.234
I told you this was a waste of time.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.578
So, that went well, all things considered.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.456
You two certainly haven't changed.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.916
Is that a bad thing?

11:10.378 --> 11:12.589
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.935
- Commander.
- Sir.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.364
They shouldn't salute me anymore.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.991
Not since I left the Order.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.701
It doesn't matter to them.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.620
It's a sign of respect.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.541
They know what you went through for them,
day after day, battle after battle.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.837
Loyalty means everything to the clones.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.305
Company, attention!

12:05.475 --> 12:08.478
Go ahead. They've been waiting to see you.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.833
As soon as Rex and the guys
knew you were back, they got to work.

12:36.381 --> 12:40.260
The paint job is a little crude,
but we think it gets the idea across.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.849
Glad to have you back, Commander.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.435
Rex, thank you.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.770
But you don't have to call me
commander anymore.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.356
Sure thing, Commander.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.527
Oh. I have one more surprise for you.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.300
Anakin, Rex, prepare all forces.
We're jumping to hyperspace immediately.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.384
Yes, sir.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.927
Men, with me.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.532
Watch it! Watch it!
You heard him, lads! Let's go!

13:26.556 --> 13:28.391
So, the attack on Mandalore was approved?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.977
No, it's Coruscant.
Grievous has attacked the capitol.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.063
What about the Chancellor?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.689
Shaak Ti has been sent to protect him,

13:34.773 --> 13:36.983
but Master Windu
has lost contact with her.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.154
Not to worry.
Our fleet can be there within the hour.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.655
So that's it?

13:43.740 --> 13:46.284
You're going to abandon Bo-Katan
and her people?

13:46.701 --> 13:50.497
Ahsoka, surely you understand this is
a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.832
The heart of the Republic is under attack.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.586
I understand that, as usual,
you're playing politics.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.340
This is why the people
have lost faith in the Jedi.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.925
I had too,

14:02.008 --> 14:06.221
until I was reminded of what the Order
means to people who truly need us.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.015
Right now, people on Coruscant need us.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.060
No. The Chancellor needs you.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.728
That's not fair.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.522
I'm not trying to be.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.193
I'll divide the 501st,

14:20.276 --> 14:22.445
make a new division
under Ahsoka's command.

14:22.862 --> 14:27.534
Unfortunately, Ahsoka is no longer a part
of the Grand Army of the Republic.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.707
We'll promote Rex to Commander
and have him lead the new division.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.042
Ahsoka can go with him as an adviser.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.627
What do you say?

14:38.503 --> 14:39.838
I accept.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.882
That is, if Obi-Wan agrees.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.345
Very well.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.558
May the Force be with you.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.981
Oh, one other thing: I killed Maul once.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.107
Best to capture him.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.985
He doesn't seem to stay dead.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.658
Thanks for the support. As always.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.535
That's what friends are for.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.707
If you're going to face Maul,
you'll need these.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.474
I took care of them. They're good as new.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.606
Maybe a little better.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.446
You capture Maul.
I'll take care of Grievous.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.990
With any luck, this will all be over soon.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.410
Master Kenobi always said
there's no such thing as luck.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.746
Good thing I taught you otherwise.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.626
Anakin!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.254
Good luck.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.967
Commander, I have Prime Minister
Almec of Mandalore on the comm.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.510
Put him through.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.597
What is the meaning of this invasion?

16:54.681 --> 16:58.393
The Republic presence here
is a direct violation of our treaty.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.478
Your time has come, Almec.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.691
We know you're Maul's puppet,
and we are coming for him.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.612
Ah-ha! Mistress Bo-Katan, the traitor.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.699
I should have known
you were behind this incursion.

17:12.782 --> 17:17.287
Siding with the Republic will make you
an enemy in the eyes of the people.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.205
I'm fine with that.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.461
You're nothing like your sister.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.222
Saxon,
prepare our forces for an all-out attack.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.892
Rook,
inform the syndicate of the invasion.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.482
It's been a while
since we had a fight like this.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.442
Are you ready?

18:03.625 --> 18:06.544
Ursa,
can you confirm the target's location?

18:06.920 --> 18:10.340
I can only confirm
that Maul has not left the city.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.510
All other attempts to locate him
have been blocked.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.304
Saxon is already scrambling his defenses.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.810
We've got incoming!

19:00.598 --> 19:03.018
What are you waiting for? Get out there!

19:06.229 --> 19:08.898
Sorry,
I didn't think to bring you a jetpack.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.608
Don't need one.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.653
Race you to the surface.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.901
Thanks, Commander!

20:29.062 --> 20:30.063
Beat you.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.981
Some things never change.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.591
We're meeting stronger opposition
than anticipated.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.428
They've already taken the docks
and are moving on your position.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.806
Escape to the Undercity.
You will be met there.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.307
Understood.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.328
No sign of Maul yet.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.664
We can't sustain a long siege.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.709
I'll head for the throne room
and deal with Almec.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.378
You must find Maul.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.385
I want you to support Ursa at the docks.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.971
We must ensure Maul doesn't escape.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.431
If he's here.

21:46.514 --> 21:51.102
If he's not, then all of this
plays right into his hands.

21:52.729 --> 21:56.983
Commander Rex, this is CT-0292.
I think we have something.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.526
I'll be right there, Captain.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.133
Captain Vaughn, what have you got?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.345
We were cutting off this access point
to the Undercity,

22:25.428 --> 22:28.682
when we engaged one of the leadership,
Gar Saxon.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.559
He disappeared through there.
Seemed in a hurry.

22:33.436 --> 22:34.771
What's down there?

22:34.854 --> 22:39.359
A system of tunnels, sewage ports, mainly.
Some conduit access pipes.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.569
Do they lead outside the city?

22:41.945 --> 22:43.113
Unknown, sir.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.701
Let's move in.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.880
The Jedi was sighted
entering the lower city.

23:00.964 --> 23:03.925
Then it's just as our lord predicted.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.635
Where's Maul?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.638
You were never the politician
your sister was.

23:55.560 --> 24:00.523
He wanted you to bring the Jedi here,
but you brought the wrong one.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.486
Ahsoka, come in.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.321
You're walking into a trap.

24:06.780 --> 24:07.781
Ahsoka!

24:50.865 --> 24:51.866
Get down.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.127
Vaughn, wait!

25:06.923 --> 25:08.341
Look out!

25:10.301 --> 25:11.428
This way! Hurry.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.346
Watch it! Watch it!

25:13.430 --> 25:14.889
Stop. Stop!

25:27.110 --> 25:30.280
I'm sorry, Commander.

25:58.641 --> 26:02.228
I was hoping for Kenobi.

26:07.067 --> 26:10.278
Why are you here?
