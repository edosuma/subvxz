10:33.110 --> 10:34.503
Oh...

10:34.546 --> 10:36.592
the antiques.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.029
The art.

10:39.073 --> 10:42.032
Mrs. Yost
had positively exquisite tastes.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.774
Hmm. Well,
don't be too impressed.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.384
Remember, this was a woman

10:46.428 --> 10:48.430
who always acted
like she was too good for you.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.693
Yes. Well, now I know why.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.303
She was.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.914
Mm.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.829
What is that scent? [sniffing]

10:55.872 --> 10:57.569
Her perfume.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.702
[chuckles] Still lingering.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.663
-[phone ringing]
-[Alma yelps]

11:03.706 --> 11:05.403
-I said don't touch me.
-You touched first.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.144
-[scoffs]
-[phone continues ringing]

11:07.188 --> 11:08.929
-Should I answer it?
-And say what?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.408
"Mrs. Yost can't come
to the phone.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.932
She's buried
beneath my begonias"?

11:11.975 --> 11:13.542
[ringing]

11:13.585 --> 11:15.022
We need to get out of here.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.545
Fine. We'll have to take
Rocco with us.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.112
-Really?
-Yes.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.809
I'm certainly not leaving him
here all alone.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.463
If we bring him home,
Dee is going to ask questions.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.639
Then we'll tell her
that Mrs. Yost took a trip,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.293
and she asked us
to look after him.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.515
You know...

11:30.559 --> 11:34.258
we could tell all the neighbors
that Mrs. Yost went away.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.786
Better still...

11:39.829 --> 11:42.702
we could arrange for some
of them to see her leave.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.355
You don't mean...

11:44.399 --> 11:46.444
Well, you're about her size,
aren't you?

11:46.488 --> 11:49.186
Oh. Bertie, you're brilliant.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.971
-Yes.
-No.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.450
We'll need to pick
a destination.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.539
Some place
she could plausibly drive to.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.454
Someone she might visit.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.195
Hang on. But...

11:58.239 --> 12:00.545
what happens
when she doesn't arrive?

12:00.589 --> 12:02.765
Well, that's the beauty part.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.506
They'll start to look for her,

12:04.549 --> 12:07.509
miles and miles away
from our front yard.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.206
Oh, my.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.165
Didn't I marry a clever girl?

12:19.869 --> 12:21.349
Uh...

12:21.392 --> 12:23.394
I guess I'll just have two eggs,
over hard.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.005
You'll have to order
more than that,

12:25.048 --> 12:26.833
since I'm buying you breakfast.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.226
What? Now why would you do that?

12:29.270 --> 12:31.881
[scoffs] After what you did
for me last night, I owe you.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.622
You think so?

12:33.665 --> 12:34.623
I do.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.451
By the way,

12:36.494 --> 12:38.932
Scooter called this morning
to apologize.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.588
Okay. And, uh...

12:43.632 --> 12:45.329
What did he have to say
for himself?

12:45.373 --> 12:47.331
Said he couldn't sleep
a wink last night

12:47.375 --> 12:48.724
'cause he felt so guilty.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.160
So he got me roses,

12:50.204 --> 12:51.640
a dozen of them.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.294
A dozen, huh?

12:53.337 --> 12:54.295
Hey.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.731
What's with the face?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.341
I was just thinking.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.387
You know, if I wanted to say
I'm sorry to a girl,

12:59.430 --> 13:00.910
I wouldn't just send roses.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.565
I would take her out to dinner.
You know?

13:03.608 --> 13:05.523
Somewhere fancy.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.873
We can't go out in public.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.396
His rich lady friend
would find out.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.529
But does she have spies
in Burbank?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.314
Or Long Beach?

13:13.357 --> 13:14.837
I mean, there's lots of
out-of-the-way places

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
he could take you.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.798
She pays his bills.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.278
-He's got to be extra careful.
-Maybe.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.324
You know, but when I'm nuts
about a gal,

13:23.367 --> 13:25.369
oh, I want to show her off.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.676
Let everybody see
how lucky I am.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.331
[scoffs]

13:30.374 --> 13:32.550
Guess he thinks different.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.682
What are you saying?

13:35.205 --> 13:36.903
Scooter's embarrassed
to be seen with me?

13:36.946 --> 13:38.818
I didn't say that.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.082
Scooter likes me.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.300
A lot.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.215
If you say so.

13:46.782 --> 13:51.482
I'll have the eggs
and bacon and some waffles...

13:51.526 --> 13:53.528
since you're paying.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.667
ALMA:
Have I reached
the Golden Iron Hotel?

14:02.711 --> 14:06.715
Yes, uh,
my name is Mrs. Carol Yost.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.979
I'm taking a trip up north
to visit my sister.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.329
I was hoping to stay
at your lovely hotel.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.680
I'd arrive tonight,
and I'd stay till Sunday.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.421
Sure, I'll hold.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.162
[Bertram chuckling]

14:19.206 --> 14:21.599
Oh. Um, you should find
a suitcase and start packing.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.775
-A suitcase?
-If Mrs. Yost went

14:23.819 --> 14:25.603
on a trip,
she would pack a suitcase.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.170
It would be in her car
when they find it.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.998
Ah. I didn't think of that.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.914
You've gotten away
with how many murders?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.003
Honestly, I don't know
how you managed without me.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.266
Yes, I'm here.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.007
Oh, wonderful.

14:38.051 --> 14:41.271
Well, I'm leaving now,
so I should be there by dinner.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.273
All right. Bye-bye.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
[chuckles]

14:44.971 --> 14:47.625
-And we're packing...
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.155
[phone ringing]

14:55.198 --> 14:56.678
Hello.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.288
Hi, Scoot. It's me.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.160
Oh. Hey, doll.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.510
Still loving
those roses I sent you?

15:02.553 --> 15:04.207
Of course. They're beautiful.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.209
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
we're good, you and me.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.777
Yeah, about that...

15:08.820 --> 15:12.172
I was thinking, if you really
wanted to apologize to me,

15:12.215 --> 15:14.000
you could take me out to dinner.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.481
Like to a restaurant?

15:17.525 --> 15:20.658
I found this place right off
the highway in Chatsworth.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.095
Middle of nowhere.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.575
But it's romantic,

15:24.619 --> 15:25.750
with good food.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.405
No one will see us. I promise.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.712
Golly. Uh, I don't know.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.192
Why would that be a problem?

15:32.235 --> 15:34.411
Unless...

15:34.455 --> 15:36.500
you just don't want to be seen
with me in public.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.200
Oh. Don't say that, baby.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.766
You're my girl.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.464
I mean...

15:43.507 --> 15:46.075
I'd love to take you out.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.382
Oh. That's terrific.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.819
Oh, and I've got
the most perfect dress.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.516
I'm really going to doll it up
for you.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.998
So, when do you want to do this?

15:56.042 --> 15:58.000
Well, how about tonight?

15:58.044 --> 15:59.480
Oh, shoot.

15:59.523 --> 16:02.048
I can't tonight.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.832
Yeah, I've got an audition.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.660
At night?

16:05.703 --> 16:07.662
Yeah, uh...

16:07.705 --> 16:10.273
the producer's shooting a movie
on location.

16:10.317 --> 16:13.537
And he can't meet
until after they wrap.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.278
I don't know when
that going to be, so...

16:15.322 --> 16:17.106
I'm on call all night.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.586
Sorry.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.109
But...

16:20.153 --> 16:22.503
Maybe some other time,
like next week?

16:24.026 --> 16:25.245
Sure.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.508
Some other time, then.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.118
You just let me know.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.859
You're the best, babe.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.432
Such glorious clothes she had.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.477
It's a shame
they'll all be washed down river

16:40.521 --> 16:42.262
with the tin cans and trout.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.959
-Alma.
-Hmm?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.917
Is that Mrs. Yost's suit?

16:45.961 --> 16:48.833
Yes. Isn't it stunning?
[chuckles]

16:48.877 --> 16:50.096
You don't have to wear her suit.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.575
You-you can just wear her coat.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.577
It's called
getting into character, Bertram.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.405
Besides...

16:55.449 --> 16:57.712
It's my chance to wear couture.
[chuckles]

16:57.755 --> 16:59.409
I don't know what
all the hullabaloo is about.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.194
I prefer your tweed suit.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.544
Ugh. Then you're certifiable.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.460
Ah...

17:06.503 --> 17:08.375
Mrs. Wong is watering
her garden.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.985
Oh. Excellent.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.076
-Well, get out there, before
she goes back into her house.
-Right.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.513
I'll put this in Mrs. Yost's car
for you.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.559
-[laughs]
-All right.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.174
I don't know who you are...

17:26.610 --> 17:29.048
but you're certainly not
a frump.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.574
♪

17:40.668 --> 17:42.713
♪

18:06.650 --> 18:08.696
♪

18:26.757 --> 18:28.672
Come on.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.370
Squeeze the ball, Papa.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.154
I know it's hard,

18:32.198 --> 18:33.982
but it's the only way
you can get your strength back.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.159
RITA:
Catherine?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.641
Can I see you downstairs
for a moment?

18:46.995 --> 18:49.128
[sighs] What do you want?

18:50.259 --> 18:53.393
I think it's time
to call a truce.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.090
I want us to be friends.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.006
The floozy that married
my father for money

18:58.049 --> 19:00.400
wants to be my pal?

19:00.443 --> 19:02.402
You don't think
I cared about him?

19:02.445 --> 19:05.144
He rescued me from the gutter.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.842
Well, I'm sure
you were grateful,

19:07.885 --> 19:09.496
but it's not the same thing
as love.

19:09.539 --> 19:12.542
Oh, I was grateful.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.675
I reinvented myself.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.546
Lost my accent.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.026
Learned how to dress.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.336
But no matter what I did,

19:23.379 --> 19:27.644
Carlo still treated me
like I was the same stupid...

19:27.688 --> 19:31.126
cocktail waitress
he met in El Paso.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.955
I tried to love him.

19:33.998 --> 19:36.044
But I couldn't.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.785
Because he's...

19:38.960 --> 19:40.135
Well, you know...

19:40.179 --> 19:41.745
awful.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.663
I don't feel sorry for you.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.231
Well, I feel sorry for you.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.973
I've heard how he talks to you
on the phone.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.280
It's nice to know
I'm not the only one

19:54.323 --> 19:56.325
forced to endure his cruelty.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.378
Did he ever tell you
I was engaged once?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.293
No.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.859
Hmm.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.688
His name was Hank.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.690
He was tall,

20:13.734 --> 20:15.214
handsome,

20:15.257 --> 20:17.390
sweet.

20:17.433 --> 20:21.307
The night he proposed to me was
the happiest night of my life.

20:22.351 --> 20:25.528
But then Father said
he was a fortune hunter.

20:25.572 --> 20:30.359
Why else
would a man like that choose me?

20:30.403 --> 20:33.275
So I sent Hank away.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.148
Catherine, I had no idea.

20:37.192 --> 20:40.195
The next week,
he put a codicil in his will,

20:40.239 --> 20:42.545
saying that if I would
embarrass him any further

20:42.589 --> 20:44.504
with any man
he didn't approve of,

20:44.547 --> 20:46.549
he would disinherit me.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.377
-[scoffs]
-Instantly.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.770
See?

20:49.813 --> 20:52.251
He tried to destroy us both.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.297
This should make us allies.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.430
You're missing the point
of my story.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.651
I wasn't confessing
I hate my father.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.828
I was explaining why I hate you.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.047
What?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.005
He married his fortune hunter.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.964
How do you think I felt?

21:10.007 --> 21:14.098
How do you think I'll feel if he
dies and you take all his money

21:14.142 --> 21:17.319
to marry that young man you have
stashed away in that apartment?

21:17.363 --> 21:18.712
Is that fair, Rita?

21:18.755 --> 21:20.975
He gets his gold digger.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.629
His gold digger gets her gigolo.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.413
And what do I get?

21:24.457 --> 21:27.286
A big lonely house
back in Texas

21:27.329 --> 21:30.071
and bingo nights
with my church group.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.596
Are you finished?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.250
Not quite.

21:37.078 --> 21:40.647
I also think you're responsible
for his fall down the stairs.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.738
And once I can prove that,

21:44.781 --> 21:47.044
I will destroy you.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.311
I'm sorry about Hank.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.097
And I'm sorry about your life.

21:57.098 --> 21:58.360
That being said...

21:58.404 --> 22:01.624
you are one fuck
of a bad houseguest.

22:11.721 --> 22:12.983
Dee.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.376
So this is where you work?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.291
Yeah.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.947
This is a nice surprise.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.341
-You're not busy, are you?
-Huh-uh.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.604
Is this a social call?

22:24.647 --> 22:26.127
Actually...

22:26.170 --> 22:28.042
I want to hire you.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.306
Okay. To do what?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.481
To tail Scooter.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.744
I have a feeling
he's lying to me.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.920
And you want me
to prove you right?

22:36.964 --> 22:38.705
I want you to prove me wrong.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.360
But...

22:41.403 --> 22:43.057
either way, I need to know.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.146
Sure. I'll trail him for you.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.148
Also...

22:47.191 --> 22:49.803
I need to be with you
when you follow him.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.892
No dice.

22:51.935 --> 22:52.980
I work alone.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.895
Not this time.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.637
And if you have
a problem with that,

22:57.680 --> 23:00.379
I'll pay you double what
you were going to charge me.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.772
I wasn't going to charge
you anything.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.426
In that case...

23:04.470 --> 23:05.601
triple it.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.822
[chuckles]

23:34.717 --> 23:36.327
[groans]

23:36.371 --> 23:38.025
-Rocco, go on.
-[barks]

23:38.068 --> 23:40.201
-Good boy.
-Why are we stopping?

23:40.244 --> 23:41.855
Well,
Rocco needed a potty break,

23:41.898 --> 23:43.465
and I'm getting rather peckish.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.032
I thought we could stop
and have some lunch.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.425
We don't have time.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.078
We have such a long way to go.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.341
It just feels odd taking
a road trip in separate cars.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.821
Especially on this road.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.693
Why is that?

23:53.736 --> 23:55.172
Alma Fillcot.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.000
It's the same route
we took on our honeymoon.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.524
Do you not remember?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.134
Come on.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.266
Let's have lunch together,
for old time's sake.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.920
This isn't our second honeymoon,

24:03.964 --> 24:05.618
it's our first crime spree.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.446
And what did I say
about touching me?

24:07.489 --> 24:08.838
Sorry.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.231
You speak
about "old times" as if

24:10.274 --> 24:11.275
we can just
turn back the clock,

24:11.319 --> 24:12.929
but I can't.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.802
You see about the dog.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.586
I'll get us some sandwiches.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.196
Then we must be on our way.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.853
[indistinct chatter]

24:25.072 --> 24:26.552
Excuse me.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.467
I'm in a hurry.
Can I get some sandwiches to go?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.772
Oh, sure. It's right over there.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.295
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.525
Alma?

24:43.569 --> 24:46.659
Alma Wilkins, is that you?

25:03.414 --> 25:05.155
Whoa.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.766
That was close.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.332
Hope I didn't frighten you.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.291
Oh, no. Not at all. It's just...

25:10.334 --> 25:12.119
My word.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.252
Tom Madison.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.559
-You're just as handsome
as ever.
-Please.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.126
But look at you.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.519
That suit.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.216
Oh. Yes. My suit.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.784
Do you like it?

25:24.827 --> 25:26.002
I'll say.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.308
You look wonderful.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.397
[giggles]

25:30.659 --> 25:31.965
In you go.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.575
Good boy.

25:37.884 --> 25:40.887
ALMA:
It's true. [laughing]

25:40.930 --> 25:43.454
You're still so funny.

25:43.498 --> 25:46.457
You always made me laugh.
[laughing]

25:48.503 --> 25:50.331
Oh, Bertie.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.985
Look who it is.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.204
It's Tom Madison,
from high school.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.556
We're going to have lunch
with him.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.479
Can you imagine?

26:08.523 --> 26:11.221
Getting laid
once in your whole life?

26:11.265 --> 26:13.310
It's no wonder Catherine's
such a bitch.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.616
Don't be so amused.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.009
That lady is dangerous.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.141
I know how to handle her.

26:18.185 --> 26:21.101
And get a little leverage
in the process.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.191
Catherine needs a man.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.976
A gorgeous hunk
her Papa wouldn't approve of.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.413
You sure she's still interested?

26:29.457 --> 26:32.373
She's on the downhill side
of fifty and picking up speed.

26:32.416 --> 26:35.332
Women never stop
needing passion.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.465
And I am going to get her some.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.902
You're going to get herlaid?
How?

26:39.946 --> 26:41.861
As it happens...

26:41.904 --> 26:43.689
I have a gigolo on retainer.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.822
[chuckles]

26:47.823 --> 26:50.609
Then I opened another place
in Santa Barbara.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.219
You own six dry cleaning stores?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.481
That is amazing.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.439
Did you hear that, Bertie?

26:55.483 --> 26:56.876
Mm. Yes. Very impressive.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.225
Shouldn't we be
getting back on the road?

26:58.268 --> 26:59.443
You know, it's probably good

26:59.487 --> 27:01.315
that you've been so busy
at work.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.230
-It will keep
your mind off the divorce.
-Honestly...

27:03.273 --> 27:04.971
I'm glad Lisa left me.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.190
I was working so hard
to save the marriage,

27:07.234 --> 27:09.149
I didn't notice the other
people in my life drifting away.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.891
Finally, I woke up and wondered
where all my friends had gone.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.414
How is that possible?

27:13.457 --> 27:14.981
You were the star quarterback.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.765
Remember how many friends
he had?

27:16.809 --> 27:20.900
No. But I remember all the
passes that were intercepted.

27:20.943 --> 27:24.512
That's where I know you from,
the football games.

27:24.555 --> 27:25.687
[chuckles] What?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.167
You were in the marching band.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.299
All this time,
I was trying to remember.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.692
[laughing]

27:30.736 --> 27:32.259
All this time?

27:32.302 --> 27:34.653
I kept asking myself,
"Was he in my math class?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.002
Was he on student council?"

27:36.045 --> 27:37.525
[Alma and Tom laugh]

27:37.568 --> 27:39.614
This whole lunch,
you've had no idea who I am?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.617
As if anyone could recognize
you behind that tuba.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.749
It was a sousaphone.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.839
So, you folks ready for dessert?

27:46.882 --> 27:48.710
Just the bill, please.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.364
Can we stay a little longer,
please?

27:50.407 --> 27:53.019
-No. It's been nice
catching up, Tom.
-Oh.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.369
We must see you again.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.718
Are you ever in L.A.?

27:56.762 --> 27:58.198
I'm there for business
quite a bit.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.721
Well, then we must
have you over.

27:59.765 --> 28:00.940
I would love that.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.071
Oh. [chuckles]

28:02.115 --> 28:04.117
Uh. No, Bertram.
Let me get that.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.379
I insist, Tom.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.946
It'll help you remember me.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.991
-Bye-bye.
-[chuckles]

28:09.992 --> 28:12.908
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.482
What the hell was that?

28:21.525 --> 28:23.266
I could say the same thing
to you.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.703
You won't let me touch you,

28:24.746 --> 28:26.356
but it's open season
for the Prom King?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.184
He's going through a divorce.
I was offering sympathy.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.272
You were flirting.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.797
You've clearly got
the same silly school-girl crush

28:31.840 --> 28:32.798
you've always had.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.364
It wasn't silly.

28:34.408 --> 28:35.888
And it wasn't
just a crush, either.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.324
Meaning what?

28:38.499 --> 28:39.718
Tom and I went out once.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.241
[laughs]

28:41.284 --> 28:43.547
I see that surprises you.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.549
Oh, well, I suppose the next
thing you're going to tell me

28:45.593 --> 28:46.768
is you let him kiss you.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.423
Oh, we did more than kiss.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.947
A lot more.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.776
Are you saying
you gave yourself to him?

28:54.820 --> 28:57.431
Don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.782
But you told me
I was your first.

29:00.826 --> 29:04.264
Yes. Well, you were
my first killer, if it helps.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.483
Oh, God.

29:06.527 --> 29:07.876
How could you of kept
this secret from me

29:07.920 --> 29:09.704
for all these years?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.228
Given what I've learned
about you in the past two days,

29:12.272 --> 29:14.840
I don't think you're
in a position to complain.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.698
♪

30:11.722 --> 30:13.768
♪

30:17.511 --> 30:18.817
Get down.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.211
DEE:
Maybe his audition
is in that building there.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.306
Did he go into that building?

30:30.350 --> 30:31.830
Nope.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.706
So that's her?

30:39.750 --> 30:40.882
His lady friend.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.362
Well, you got your answer.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.277
-Now, let's go.
-Wait.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.149
Not yet.

30:49.499 --> 30:50.979
You're breaking up with me?

30:51.023 --> 30:52.851
Not permanently,

30:52.894 --> 30:55.679
but it's not safe to see each
other while Catherine's in town.

30:55.723 --> 30:58.030
She found the canceled checks
for your rent.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.380
If she gets any more proof,
I'm sunk.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.123
Well, isn't there some way
we can get rid of her?

31:04.166 --> 31:06.908
I did have one crazy idea,
but...

31:08.083 --> 31:09.737
Well, it's a bit sordid.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.173
I like sordid.

31:12.609 --> 31:15.351
Catherine is a lonely,
middle-aged woman,

31:15.395 --> 31:17.223
desperate for companionship.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.834
But she'd be disinherited
if she was caught

31:19.878 --> 31:21.401
in a compromising position.

31:22.706 --> 31:23.969
You mean like sex?

31:24.970 --> 31:26.841
Yes, like sex.

31:26.885 --> 31:31.280
And if I had a photo of her
and some man in flagrante

31:31.324 --> 31:33.239
Flagrante.Now, where is that?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.850
Let me finish.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.679
I could use that photo
to blackmail her.

31:38.722 --> 31:41.638
Make her go back to Texas
and get out of our lives

31:41.682 --> 31:43.858
permanently.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.381
You're a genius, Rita.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.602
So, the old girl's hot to trot?

31:48.645 --> 31:50.778
Well, not just for anyone.

31:50.821 --> 31:54.173
But, well,
she could be seduced by...

31:54.216 --> 31:56.958
oh, let's say,
an incredibly handsome actor.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.960
Hang on.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.007
You're asking me to screw her?

32:02.050 --> 32:05.749
I'm asking you
to ride to my rescue.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.229
Oh, I don't mind riding
to your rescue,

32:07.273 --> 32:09.231
but does she have
to be the horse?

32:11.059 --> 32:12.626
DEE:
Why didn't you tell me?

32:12.669 --> 32:14.236
Tell you what?

32:14.280 --> 32:16.412
How beautiful she is.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.066
Does it matter?

32:19.241 --> 32:21.374
Of course it does.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.116
I thought I had a chance.
I thought he might...

32:25.334 --> 32:28.207
God, I am so stupid.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.382
Dee? Hey!

32:30.383 --> 32:31.950
Hey, Dee!

32:34.082 --> 32:35.779
Whoa. Whoa.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.825
-[horn honking]
-Dee. Dee!

32:37.868 --> 32:39.435
Hey!

32:41.307 --> 32:42.873
Oh, this is bad.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.310
This is bad.

32:45.267 --> 32:46.790
But I thought you loved me.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.227
I do, baby.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.011
That's why I can't
go through with this.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.926
You're the only woman
I could be with.

How's the audition going?

32:56.931 --> 32:58.541
Looks like you got the part.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.674
I-I'm sorry. Is this person
a friend of yours?

33:00.717 --> 33:02.458
I'm not his friend.

33:02.502 --> 33:03.764
I'm his lover.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.026
What?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.810
I have never met this woman.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.421
Dee, please go.

33:08.464 --> 33:11.554
He made me dress up
as a cleaning woman

33:11.598 --> 33:13.861
so you wouldn't know he was
seeing me behind your back.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.776
That was you in the photos?

33:15.819 --> 33:17.865
Photos? What photos?

33:17.908 --> 33:20.041
You cheated on me with that?

33:20.085 --> 33:23.001
Yeah. He screwed a fat girl.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.741
But unlike you,

I didn't have to pay his rent
to get his motor going.

-Ah!
-What are you trying
to do to me?

33:29.659 --> 33:30.791
Just go.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.619
I'm going.

33:32.662 --> 33:33.663
For good.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.056
He is all yours, lady.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.666
You deserve each other.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.629
Okay, I fooled around.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.848
But you spied on me,
which is worse.

33:44.892 --> 33:48.287
I spied because I thought
you were cheating.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.636
Which you were.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.031
It's over.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.424
But you just told
me you loved me.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.079
-Ha! And you believed me?
-Yes.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.212
Well, it's nice to know
one of us can act.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.828
