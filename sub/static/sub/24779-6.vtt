00:14.055 --> 00:15.807
[narrator]  One year ago:

00:15.890 --> 00:17.517
what begins as a mere curiosity

00:17.600 --> 00:22.814
over time becomes
Lionel's private obsession.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.992
Everywhere he goes,
he sees clues of a hidden world.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.744
But the allure of secret societies

00:35.827 --> 00:39.873
has always had a special hold
on those without a tribe.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.628
1924: after being rejected
by the Scribes of Carthage,

00:45.712 --> 00:47.797
William Landis, founder of  The Bugle,

00:47.881 --> 00:49.799
outs them in an exposé

00:49.883 --> 00:51.551
on the school's secret societies.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.972
It was a landmark piece
as well as a master class in shade.

00:56.056 --> 01:01.394
A century later, Landis' article
becomes a guide for Lionel.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.022
Lionel's little project has become a quest

01:04.105 --> 01:06.399
to find a theory of everything,

01:06.483 --> 01:09.194
an explanation for the recent
chaos gripping Winchester

01:09.277 --> 01:11.446
by uncovering the secret histories

01:11.529 --> 01:13.656
and societies that underpin it.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.285
[camera shutter clicking]

01:25.084 --> 01:29.297
But is there really anything there
to be uncovered?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.725
♪ My phone in my hand ♪

01:40.809 --> 01:43.645
[Wesley] Okay, so if you solve
the hard problem

01:43.728 --> 01:45.522
of consciousness, you change everything.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.023
Reductionist thinking gets locked

01:47.106 --> 01:49.442
in the 20th-century vault
where it belongs,

01:49.526 --> 01:53.822
and a whole new era of understanding
our place in the universe opens up.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.657
[cell phone keyboard clicking]

01:55.740 --> 01:57.033
Where'd you go?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.870
I was looking up reductionist thinking
so I could have a half-worthy response.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.038
Sorry.

02:02.122 --> 02:06.835
Our philosophy program is as competitive
as a lip-sync in a  Drag Race  finale.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.670
[cell phone keyboard clicking]

02:08.753 --> 02:10.880
Okay, you are not looking up  Drag Race.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.258
No, looking up a GIF from  A Beautiful Mind

02:13.341 --> 02:15.677
in anticipation of the day
they make a sexy biopic

02:15.760 --> 02:17.387
about you solving equations.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.806
[laughs] OMG.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.393
Would my character write on windows,
like that's a thing?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.603
LOL, obvi.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.896
[Wesley] What about you?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.940
What are you gonna get
your Nobel Prize in?

02:29.023 --> 02:31.234
Nobel Prize? Me?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.695
Humility.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.697
They allow that at Winchester?

02:35.780 --> 02:38.074
Come on. What is it?

02:39.868 --> 02:42.370
Not everyone's destined for greatness.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.001
Hey, so I gotta hop into class.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.296
Oh. Yeah. Cool.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.797
TTYL.

"Meet me at ten, Silvio.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.516
There's something you have to see, Silvio.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.727
I know you like to sleep in
when you don't have class,

03:05.810 --> 03:07.103
but this is important, Silvio."

03:07.186 --> 03:08.938
[Lionel] Sorry, okay?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.523
Class ran late.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.108
And Professor--

03:12.191 --> 03:13.109
You don't care.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.153
I forget. [chuckles]

03:19.532 --> 03:20.742
[Silvio] Lionel.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.663
[Lionel] I promise it'll be worth it.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.625
Unless NeNe Leakes is in your room
with a bottle of rosé,

03:28.708 --> 03:29.751
I doubt it.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.252
[Kelsey] I know how you feel, Sam.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.339
The whole Sorbet incident
ruined magazines for me,

03:34.422 --> 03:36.090
and I love magazines.

03:37.842 --> 03:38.885
What happened here?

03:38.968 --> 03:40.678
[Sam] It's just a stupid prank.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.348
Maybe someone sent you a fruit basket,

03:43.723 --> 03:45.266
but a passerby took the basket...

03:45.350 --> 03:48.144
-[Kelsey] Uh-huh.
-...and the other fruit

03:48.228 --> 03:49.562
and the cellophane.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.273
Yeah, and then they wrote
the word "bitch" on a banana

03:52.357 --> 03:55.985
in an empowering way, like, "biiitch."

03:56.069 --> 03:58.154
The trolls have entered the real world,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.073
all thanks to that AltIvy guy.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.324
-Or girl.
-[Silvio] Of course.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.077
Wouldn't want to be sexist,
whoever this monster is.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.246
-Thank you, Latino Andy Cohen.
-Aww.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.997
I'm really sorry.
Is there anything I can--

04:08.081 --> 04:10.625
No, it's good.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.461
It's just another day.

04:16.381 --> 04:19.592
[door opens and closes]

04:19.676 --> 04:21.135
Okay.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.263
Open them.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.018
Uh, looks a lot like your room.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.354
[chuckles] I turned it
into a live-work space

04:31.437 --> 04:32.814
for  The New Independent!

04:32.897 --> 04:35.275
[scoffs] So you bought a whiteboard.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.194
[Lionel] And a bouquet of markers.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.114
Starting a news outlet
takes more than a bouquet of--

04:41.197 --> 04:43.032
Wait, are these Expo brand?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.033
[gasps]

04:44.117 --> 04:45.660

04:45.743 --> 04:47.704
Ah. I love that smell.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.330
I know it's gross. Shut up.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.333
So how are we gonna get traction
for this thing?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.501
You may speak now.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.088
[Lionel] Well...

04:57.171 --> 04:58.423
[cell phone chimes]

05:01.384 --> 05:02.969
I know that look.

05:03.928 --> 05:04.762
What look?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.723
The "I'm 'bout to get some" look.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.893
Well, I don't want to get ahead of myself,
but there is this guy, and--

05:10.977 --> 05:13.104
Is this a relationship
or still just a penetrationship?

05:13.187 --> 05:16.065
More like a text each other for hours

05:16.149 --> 05:17.775
in separate rooms... ship.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.861
Honey, if you're not hooking up,
it's not a thing.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.070
Even when you  are  hooking up,

05:21.154 --> 05:22.238
it's usually not a thing.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.323

05:23.906 --> 05:25.742
Oh, hell no!

05:25.825 --> 05:26.659
She's got to go.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.244
[Silvio] Calm down. I texted her.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.579
What's that smell?

05:29.662 --> 05:30.747
A bouquet of markers.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.332
No. No, that's not it.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.209
It smells like mediocrity.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.004
-[yelps]
-Okay, ladies, calm down.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.923
Brooke is a fantastic writer,
and the pickings are slim.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.675
Plus, I can depend on her 24-7.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.095
She's basically a cat lady with no cats.
Even they can't handle her intensity.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.306
Well, I would just say
I was allergic, but okay.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.475
[snorts] Fine.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.476
Great.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.269
Now, let's talk launch feature.

05:53.352 --> 05:56.355
I'm working on something,
but it'll take some time.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.777
What have you been digging up, Lionel?

06:01.569 --> 06:03.112
[sighs]

06:03.196 --> 06:04.697
Secret societies.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.282
You won't believe the connections--

06:06.365 --> 06:07.575
-Pass.
-[Lionel] Why?

06:07.658 --> 06:10.828
No one's done a real exposé
in, like, a century.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.288
They're just rich-boy fraternities

06:12.371 --> 06:14.373
with secret handshakes
and disappointed girlfriends.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.374
[sighs]

06:15.458 --> 06:18.252
CORE is getting Carson Rhodes to come
to campus. Maybe we do a profile--

06:18.336 --> 06:19.170
Boring.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.506
You know what's not boring?

06:21.589 --> 06:22.507
Fire.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.716
The Davis House fire.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.218
Who started it and why?

06:25.301 --> 06:27.303
A student. By accident. Who cares?

06:27.386 --> 06:29.889
There's real stuff
going on here right now.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.850
A-P is clearly going through
growing pains with integration.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.769
Football team got caught deflating balls.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.770
Criminal.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.522
AltIvyW.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.816
What if we figured out who it is?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.318
You said it yourself, A-P's growing pains.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.737
What we just saw with Sam
is more than that.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.365
And AltIvyW is enabling this.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.325
A story about an Internet troll?

06:49.408 --> 06:50.701
Could be a fool's errand.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.329
If we had more staff, maybe.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.748
[cell phone chimes]

06:55.832 --> 06:57.750
Get me real pitches, bitches.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.753
Okay, time to go eye-fuck
my poli-sci professor.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.380
I mean learn. [chuckles]

07:08.719 --> 07:12.473
Lionel,
your story  on the troll could be good.

07:13.474 --> 07:17.645
It's actually a back door
into my secret society research.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.775
What if AltIvy isn't just
some guy or girl?

07:22.859 --> 07:25.319
What if it's a real underground society?

07:25.403 --> 07:26.779
Fascinating.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.489
Wait.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.867
Why are you being so nice?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.202
Look.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.621
Even though you are perpetually awash

07:35.705 --> 07:38.207
in jealousy over my many achievements,

07:38.291 --> 07:41.002
your Hancock scoop
marginally impressed me.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.587
I think there's something there.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.297
Do you think that was a compliment?

07:44.380 --> 07:48.134
Lionel, your energy
is super hostile, okay?

07:48.718 --> 07:51.012
I saw Sam's Instagram on the bananas.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.222
This stuff hurts.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.141
We have to do this.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.684
Okay, but Silvio doesn't want us--

07:56.767 --> 07:59.020
When people care, he'll care.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.229
He's a story whore,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.106
among other kinds of whore.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.108
What do you want?

08:07.111 --> 08:08.237
[Lionel sighs]

08:13.618 --> 08:14.952
Awesome!

08:15.495 --> 08:18.915
So I have class, and then
I tutor at Fitzgerald Hall.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.666
Then Mountaineering Society,

08:20.750 --> 08:22.627
a speech to FHIP on behalf of AAURI,

08:22.710 --> 08:24.962
-and then I--
-Okay, I get it. You're busy.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.423
There it is.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.133
Rage.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.260
I'll be done at eight.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.887
I'll text you.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.055
All right.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.433
[cell phone chimes]

08:39.060 --> 08:39.894
[sighs]

08:43.189 --> 08:47.652
[Lionel] It's a good story too,
but Silvio's so controlling.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.071
And now he's brought in Brooke.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.280
And we don't like Brooke?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.240
We don't.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.242
Silvio's done a lot for me.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.746
He really has.
But I think he craves the friction.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.374
You know, he can't do his job without it.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.755
Let's talk about something else.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.301
Hmm.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.887
I suddenly don't know what to say.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.014
Well...

09:18.182 --> 09:20.393
we don't have to talk.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.982
[cell phone chiming]

09:33.573 --> 09:35.199
[sighs]

09:36.534 --> 09:37.618
Do you need to go?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.328
[Lionel sighs]

09:39.412 --> 09:40.997
Yeah.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.876
But I don't want to.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.797
[cell phone chimes]

09:54.427 --> 09:55.845
Text you?

09:58.055 --> 09:59.098
Yeah.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.934
Sure.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.269
[Lionel chuckles]

10:06.814 --> 10:08.733
You're terrifying, you know that?

10:09.358 --> 10:10.359
Yes.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.738
Brooke, what are we even doing down here?

10:13.821 --> 10:17.158
I think that AltIvyW
and whoever kidnapped Sorbet

10:17.241 --> 10:18.743
are one and the same.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.161
Racially motivated language,

10:20.244 --> 10:22.413
intimidation tactics, vicious tone.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.373
[Lionel] Okay, it doesn't
explain the basement.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.374
[Brooke] Doesn't it?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
All we have to do is go through
every recycling bin on campus

10:27.918 --> 10:29.962
and find magazines with cut-out letters.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.757
Then we have the subscriber's name,
and boom, we got a suspect.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.760
Brooke, this isn't some TV show, okay?

10:35.843 --> 10:37.178
What are the chances we'd find

10:37.261 --> 10:39.305
this hypothetical magazine in all this?

10:39.388 --> 10:40.306
No, you're right.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.308
We shouldn't try because it's too hard.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.227
[Coco] This a new work-study program?

10:45.311 --> 10:46.395
[Lionel stammers] We were--

10:46.479 --> 10:48.481
Lionel mistakenly
threw his mouth guard out,

10:48.564 --> 10:50.775
and I, being the friend
that I am, had to help.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.401
You know, grinding without your guard

10:52.485 --> 10:54.904
can lead to expensive implants
later in life.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.739
That wasn't suspiciously specific.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.742
-[Lionel gulps]
-[Brooke] Coco, is it?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.786
Been going through a lot lately, huh?

11:01.869 --> 11:04.246
-What? No. I--
-How are you and Sam doing?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.581
Things still a little tense?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.208
Ignore her crazy.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.793
We're trying to track down the troll.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.795
What are you doing, Lionel?

11:10.878 --> 11:12.254
Everyone's a suspect.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.172
[Coco] Okay, Lionel,

11:13.255 --> 11:15.424
you need to come get
Agatha Shifty over here.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.593
Yeah, enough, Brooke.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.512
Come on, Coco. We're leaving.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.645
Oh, my God.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.021
Can we stop walking together?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.231
Sure thing.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.945
[sighs]

11:51.710 --> 11:52.628
Ding-dong, bitch!

11:52.711 --> 11:53.838
[quietly] Heavens to Betsy!

11:53.921 --> 11:55.047
[Rashid] One second!

11:55.131 --> 11:56.715
-How did you--
-I followed you, traitor.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.050
Oh, God.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.055
-May I help you?
-[Al] Now is not the greatest time.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.140
We'll see.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.855
It smells like piss in here.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.982
I have a nervous bladder.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.067
[Rashid] What nonsense
have you brought to our doorstep?

12:15.151 --> 12:16.444
[Lionel] We're on assignment

12:16.527 --> 12:19.280
and apparently playing
good cop/batshit-crazy cop.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.116
[sniffs] What is that?

12:22.199 --> 12:23.492
Is this yours?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.660
Yes.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.413
I enjoy the sharp and nuanced
writing of Ta-Nehisi Coates.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.873
-Is that a crime?
-Not yet.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.667
There is a bill, but hopefully
it won't get past the House.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.045
There are letters cut out that
match the Sorbet ransom note.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.673
[Rashid] This is my magazine, but...

12:38.716 --> 12:40.801
only a psychopath would steal a dog

12:40.885 --> 12:43.137
and then write a ransom note.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.600
Need water, Al? You're sweating.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.685
I also have active glands.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.604
-[Sorbet whimpering]
-[Al coughing]

12:51.687 --> 12:53.606
And I have the flu.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.900
My body's a complete disaster.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.818
[barks]

12:57.902 --> 12:59.195
Sorbet.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.239
Fine.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.324
I took her.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.368
Kelsey was just so annoying
with this damn dog,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.120
so I decided to prank her, okay?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.998
But then something magical happened.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.625
I fell in love.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.711
You guys ever see a dog
have a puppy dream?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.589
If you have and your heart didn't explode,
you're just dead inside, fam.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.549
-You have to give her back.
-[Al] I know.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.926
I'm trying to find a way to do it

13:22.009 --> 13:24.303
to where I don't come off
looking like an asshole.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.722
You kidnapped a medically prescribed dog.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.390
You  are  an asshole.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.976
Right.
I just don't want to come off like one.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.478
Why are you trolling Sam White?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.146
Where did AltIvyW come from?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.023
-Why you mad, Al?
-[Al] Wait.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.483
You think I'm the troll?

13:37.566 --> 13:39.902
Al is a lot of things,
and most of them are terrible,

13:39.985 --> 13:42.363
but he is not an alt-right
monster, probably.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.282
[Al] I'm not the troll,
and I can prove it.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.825
That dude's trolling me, too.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.749
I was Eminem for Halloween.

13:53.832 --> 13:54.667
[Brooke] Hmm.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.377
Might not want to scroll through too far.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.754
AirDropped us the evidence, Lionel.
We got what we need.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.881
And don't be so sex negative, Al.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.675
A little dick pic ain't never hurt nobody.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.134
Ain't nothing little about it.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.470
I noticed. Left you my number.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.681
[Lionel] At least one mystery's solved.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.182
[scoffs] The wrong one.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.726
Al, you're gonna give the dog back, right?

14:12.810 --> 14:13.852
Yeah.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.563
I have been saying this for weeks!

14:15.646 --> 14:17.857
Sometimes you just have to hear it
from the right person.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.692
Okay, Sorbet.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.318
Gotta give you back to Kelsey.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.736
Time to give Dada kisses.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.321
-[barks]
-Oh, wait.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.824
[Sorbet whimpers and barks]

14:29.869 --> 14:31.620
I was never here.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.788
And I'm gonna leave now.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.666
Let's just pretend this never happened.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.960
I should have opened
that window weeks ago.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.461
Egad!

14:40.004 --> 14:41.422
I did a reverse image search

14:41.505 --> 14:44.341
and found Al's pictures
on  Pastiche's  website.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.093
It was their Halloween party.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.136
So what?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.513
We think it's Kurt Fletcher?

14:49.597 --> 14:50.931
That's not too obvious?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
Could be a lead.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.518
What?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.397
How could you?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.357
You didn't even think we'd find anything,

15:00.441 --> 15:02.151
and yet you stole a clue from me,

15:02.234 --> 15:04.528
leaving me to dig
until my Adderall wore off.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.863
Sorry. It was just...

15:05.946 --> 15:08.991
right there
right after we fought about it.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.784
I left it there.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.912
I found it an hour earlier.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.831
I figured you needed a little victory
for your fragile self-esteem.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.832
Oh, my God.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.959
Just when you had me
feeling sorry for you.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.253
Why are we at each other's throats?

15:21.337 --> 15:24.256
I mean, from day one,
you've been shady-ing me.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.800
[laughs] "Shading."

15:26.884 --> 15:28.677
[Brooke scoffs]

15:28.761 --> 15:30.304
I don't know. I--

15:30.387 --> 15:31.513
I guess...

15:32.806 --> 15:34.642
it could be...

15:36.769 --> 15:38.437
I've just always been the only one.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.776
I get that.

15:44.693 --> 15:48.155
Even my superior intellect wasn't immune
to crabs-in-a-barrel thinking.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.158
Either we support each other,

15:51.241 --> 15:53.869
or we'll both end up steamed

15:53.953 --> 15:55.913
and eaten at a backyard cookout.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.498
You're so specific.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.499
[Brooke] Mm.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.000
And confident.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.503
What's your secret?

16:03.170 --> 16:06.215
Oh, Lionel, it's easy.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.509
Just be great at everything.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.970
-Ow.
-[laughs]

16:11.053 --> 16:14.014
Now, let's go fuck
this fine-ass white boy.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.432
[sighs]

16:15.516 --> 16:18.978
Do you mean fuck him up?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.021
Sure.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.732
[Kurt] I'm gonna stop you right there.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.317
Yes, Sam and I go at each other,

16:25.401 --> 16:26.902
but, like, intellectually.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.279
I would never resort
to racist banana humor.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.781
That genre died in the '30s...

16:30.864 --> 16:32.533
and resurfaced and died again in the '70s.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.910
Also,  Pastiche
is an award-winning magazine.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.121
If you're looking
for base social commentary,

16:37.204 --> 16:38.247
try Andy Borowitz.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.164
[Brooke] Never.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.335
[scoffs] AltIvyW just posted again.

16:43.419 --> 16:47.047
"Now Sam White's pulling
a banana-gate sympathy grab?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.048
Kill yourself"?

16:48.132 --> 16:49.758
Hmm. See? Couldn't be me.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.926
We're right here.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.428
[Lionel] Posts can be scheduled.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.430
Well, check my computer.
How did you--

16:54.513 --> 16:58.183
Nothing here but an overwhelmingly graphic
search history.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.476
To some.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.186
Filthy.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.855
I like that.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.154
[scoffs] I really blew it.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.156
Yeah, I blame you as well.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.199
Sorry. Force of habit.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.993
Not the story.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.371
Although that's not going well, either.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.250
[sighs] We need to clear our minds.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.255
[Lionel sighs]

17:29.423 --> 17:32.134
[slow-tempo music playing]

17:41.894 --> 17:42.936
[clears throat]

17:45.022 --> 17:46.607
Why are you disrobing?

17:46.690 --> 17:50.402
This little "will they
or won't they" dance we have,

17:50.486 --> 17:52.404
we need to see where it takes us.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.406
It takes us to "won't they."

17:54.490 --> 17:56.200
Let's see, huh?

17:56.283 --> 17:59.161
Brooke. [laughing] I'm gay.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.830
Oh, that's so reductive.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.125
Gay, straight--

18:05.209 --> 18:08.629
sexuality is a spectrum.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.130
[Troy] No means no.

18:11.673 --> 18:15.219
[Reggie laughing]

18:15.302 --> 18:18.013
-Paper-thin walls.
-Damn.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.765
'Sup, Lionel?

18:19.848 --> 18:21.016
Hi, strange lady.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.142
[Brooke] Hello.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.479
Am I interrupting something?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.814
Actually, I hope I am.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.608
This is not what it looks like at all,

18:29.691 --> 18:31.860
unless it looks like
Brooke has terrible gaydar,

18:31.944 --> 18:32.861
'cause it is that.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.240
I am not into her in any way,
shape or form.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.866
Like, at all. At all.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.660
Okay, a bitch got feelings now.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.870
I figured you could use some food.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.915
But this was the only thing open.

18:45.707 --> 18:46.667
So...

18:46.750 --> 18:48.377
you guys haven't had any luck?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.838
Not until now.

18:52.756 --> 18:56.885
Well, why don't you take a page out
of the  Fallout 4  handbook?

18:57.344 --> 19:00.681
Kill mutants and miss the RPG elements
of the previous games?

19:00.764 --> 19:01.807
-[laughs]
-I know.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.267
It was, like, way too linear.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.769
-[both laugh]
-Fuck y'all talking about?

19:06.353 --> 19:07.688
Um...

19:07.771 --> 19:09.106
what I mean is...

19:09.773 --> 19:11.358
hack that shit.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.283
No. No.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.495
I mean, you know, I could, but I won't.

19:23.579 --> 19:27.416
Why is everybody treating me like
I'm some deus ex machi-Negro?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.460
I'd go with deus ex hack-ina,
but that's just me.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.504
[scoffs] I thought
with what happened to Sam--

19:32.588 --> 19:33.505
Sam?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.925
[Lionel] Someone left bananas on her door
and wrote "bitch" on them.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.970
In an empowering way, like, "biiitch"?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.307
[inhales sharply]

19:43.390 --> 19:44.808
[sighs]

19:48.020 --> 19:49.146
Fuck.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.111
[Brooke] What's happening?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.739
Designing a modified
dictionary attack program.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.909
It tests millions of passwords
to identify uncommon letter combinations--

20:01.992 --> 20:03.160
Enough with the nerd talk.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.912
Make with the clickety-clack.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.331
[inhales sharply] Strap in.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.999
Might be a long night.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.585
Stay close.
I'll text y'all when it's done.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.922
[thunder booming]

20:22.638 --> 20:25.432
[laughs]

20:28.560 --> 20:30.312
That bad, huh?

20:30.395 --> 20:35.025
I'm, like, 0 for 20 on my personal goals
for this week.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.110
You put too much pressure on yourself.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.572
I should know.
I was the king of that shit.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.159
And look at what you have done.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.162
You gave the black students a voice
after the blackface party,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.873
you blew up the Hancocks' spot,

20:49.957 --> 20:54.086
and you realized you prefer the gentle
but firm touch of a man.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.297
And I blew off my date...

20:57.381 --> 20:58.340
twice.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.467
Oh, you let down Sampson?

21:01.885 --> 21:03.011
Who?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.680
Isn't that his name?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.599
I mean the mean gay dude
who's all, "Get it, girl.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.185
Put your shirt on. Now take it off, girl."

21:10.269 --> 21:11.812
Silvio?

21:11.895 --> 21:13.605
That nigga.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.107
I let him down, too.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.778
I always thought of myself
as an okay writer, but...

21:21.363 --> 21:23.407
he made me an okay journalist.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.702
And he's done wonders
for your self-esteem.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.914
You gotta let him go.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.585
Pretty sure it's Wilson.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.129

21:37.671 --> 21:38.630
Hmm.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.257

21:41.508 --> 21:43.510
