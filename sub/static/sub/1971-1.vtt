00:34.160 --> 00:35.366
Start simple.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.965
Start with what you know is true.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.047
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.371
I was in the Hunger Games.
I escaped.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.567
Peeta... Peeta was left behind.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.045
Miss Everdeen?

00:56.240 --> 00:57.526
You can't be in here.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.442
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.361
You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.290
Just five more minutes.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.161
No.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.244
No, please, don't.
It's just five more...

01:16.320 --> 01:20.689
Don't touch me! Don't!
No! No! Get off of me!

02:17.840 --> 02:19.251
Finnick.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.729
I wanted to go back
for Peeta and Johanna,

02:27.440 --> 02:29.363
but I, uh...

02:29.440 --> 02:31.442
I couldn't move.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.123
They have Annie, too.
They took her.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.446
She's, uh...

02:45.560 --> 02:46.800
She's in the Capitol.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.764
I wish she was dead.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.084
I wish they were all
dead and we were, too.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.325
Miss Everdeen.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.484
Colonel Boggs,
District 13's head of security.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.451
I know you've been discharged,

03:34.520 --> 03:36.841
but President Coin's
requested to meet with you first.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.883
Is there any news?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.928
I'm just here to escort you.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.890
We were always told
there was nothing left of 13.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.560
Capitol bombed
the surface to rubble.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.003
But we're military,
so we learned to survive down here.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.604
Preparing, training.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.484
The war never stopped for us.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.811
There she is.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.170
Our Girl on Fire.

05:04.280 --> 05:08.046
Madam President,
may I present you with The Mockingjay.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.527
What an honor it is to meet you.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.685
You're a courageous young woman.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.400
I know how disorienting this must be.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.327
And I can't imagine
what it's like to live through
the atrocities of those Games.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.606
Katniss,

05:20.680 --> 05:22.444
President Alma Coin.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.290
Please know how welcome you are.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.007
I hope you'll find
some comfort with us.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.487
We've known loss in 13, too.

05:32.080 --> 05:36.529
This is history.
Right here at this table.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.720
I apologize.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.960
I wish you had more time to recover,
but unfortunately,
we don't have that luxury.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.485
Please, have a seat.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.251
Are you aware of what's happened?

05:48.520 --> 05:51.285
When you fired your
arrow at the force field

05:52.200 --> 05:54.328
you electrified the nation.

05:54.680 --> 05:59.242
There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.

05:59.760 --> 06:05.085
We believe that if we keep
this energy going we can unify
the districts against the Capitol.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.050
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,

06:08.120 --> 06:11.124
we could be waiting
another 75 years for this opportunity.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.202
Everyone in 13 is ready for this.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.089
What about Peeta?
Is he alive?

06:15.160 --> 06:18.130
I don't know.
And I wish that I did.

06:18.880 --> 06:22.248
But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

06:22.360 --> 06:26.126
The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.488
But I know their system very well.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.846
I managed to break through.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.401
All we need now is
the perfect message.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.721
Katniss,
here's what we need to do.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.485
We need to show them
that The Mockingjay's alive and well

06:38.560 --> 06:41.325
and willing to stand up
and join this fight.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.483
'Cause we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.164
The way you did.

06:49.080 --> 06:53.927
So we're gonna
shoot a series of propaganda clips,

06:54.200 --> 06:55.884
propos, I like to call them,

06:55.960 --> 06:57.371
on The Mockingjay.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.283
Spreads the word

06:59.360 --> 07:02.091
that we're gonna
stoke the fire of this rebellion.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.970
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.202
You left him there.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.411
- You left Peeta in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...

07:11.480 --> 07:13.289
Peeta was the one
who was supposed to live.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.407
Miss Everdeen.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.330
This revolution is about everyone.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.243
It's about all of us.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.130
And we need a voice.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.521
Then you should've saved Peeta.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.883
Maybe you should have
rescued the boy instead.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.680
Oh, no.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.530
No, listen to me.
No one else can do this but her.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.728
This is not the girl you described.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.844
Obviously, we need to make it personal.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.490
Remind her who the real enemy is.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.403
She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.403
Unless she's forgotten.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.131
There's explaining and there's showing.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.526
Let her see what
the Capitol did to 12.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.685
She can't handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.401
This is the only choice you have.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.128
People don't always show up
the way you want them to, Madam President.

08:15.200 --> 08:20.331
But that anger, that anger-driven
defiance, that's what we want.
And we can redirect it.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.369
We need to unite
these people out there

08:22.480 --> 08:24.050
that have been doing nothing
but killing each other

08:24.120 --> 08:25.565
in an arena for years.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.361
We have to have a lightning rod.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.727
They'll follow her.
She's the face of the revolution.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.722
Let her see it.
Let her go home.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.846
Send her.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.920
I can't believe
you're going through with this.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.725
You can say "no."

09:10.800 --> 09:12.962
I need to see it for myself.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.491
This way.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.282
13 swept everything,
top to bottom

10:14.360 --> 10:16.044
so you'd be safe.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.208
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.121
Yeah. I'm sure.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.371
We'll have our eyes on you from above.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.007
Figures.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.611
Hey!

14:06.440 --> 14:08.090
Come on.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.126
Don't you wanna see Prim?

14:12.840 --> 14:15.047
There you go.
You're breakin' my heart.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.287
Shh.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.685
Egeria!

15:30.520 --> 15:32.329
We need to fix these lines.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.409
I won't say "rebels."

15:36.000 --> 15:38.844
These are senseless acts of defiance.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.049
And I won't legitimize them.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.330
We'll call them "criminals."

15:46.520 --> 15:47.646
Mmm.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.481
"Radicals."

15:50.200 --> 15:51.361
Hmm.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.081
Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.891
Never let them see you bleed.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.404
Citizens,

16:05.320 --> 16:10.201
tonight I address all of Panem as one.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.488
<i>Since the Dark Days,</i>

16:13.840 --> 16:17.481
<i>Panem has had
an unprecedented era of peace.</i>

16:18.080 --> 16:21.243
<i>It is a peace built upon cooperation.</i>

16:21.560 --> 16:24.404
<i>And a respect for law and order.</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:28.326
<i>In the past weeks,
you have heard of sporadic violence</i>

16:28.400 --> 16:33.327
<i>following the actions
of a few radicals in the Quarter Quell.</i>

16:34.080 --> 16:36.924
<i>Those who choose this destructive path,</i>

16:37.520 --> 16:39.966
<i>your actions are based
on a misunderstanding</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:43.601
<i>of how we have survived.
Together.</i>

16:44.240 --> 16:46.208
<i>It is a contract.</i>

16:46.960 --> 16:52.000
<i>Each district supplies the Capitol.
Like blood to a heart.</i>

16:52.640 --> 16:57.441
<i>In return,
the Capitol provides order and security.</i>

16:58.280 --> 17:00.965
To refuse work

17:01.080 --> 17:04.367
<i>is to put the entire system in danger.</i>

17:05.000 --> 17:08.321
<i>The Capitol is the beating heart of Panem.</i>

17:08.680 --> 17:11.126
<i>Nothing can survive without a heart.</i>

17:12.880 --> 17:19.047
<i>The criminals that kneel before you
use symbols for the purpose of sedition.</i>

17:19.640 --> 17:24.406
Which is why all images of The Mockingjay
are now forbidden.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.004
Possessing them will be
considered treason.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.969
Punishable by death.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.846
Justice shall be served swiftly.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.040
<i>Order shall be restored.</i>

17:39.000 --> 17:41.970
<i>To those who ignore
the warnings of history...</i>

17:48.720 --> 17:52.611
<i>...prepare to pay the ultimate price.</i>

18:37.720 --> 18:39.529
It's okay.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.886
We're okay.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.890
We're all here now.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.044
Buttercup!

18:46.400 --> 18:47.970
I smuggled him in.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.446
I got Dad.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.044
And I got some
of your herbs from the kitchen.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.402
They have strict rules.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.200
I don't know
what they'll do if
they find him here.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.520
You should try to eat something.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.642
<i>Hello. Good evening.</i>

19:38.720 --> 19:41.610
<i>And a big welcome
to all in Panem.</i>

19:42.000 --> 19:43.445
<i>I'm Caesar Flickerman.</i>

19:43.640 --> 19:46.166
<i>And whoever you are,
whatever it is you're doing,</i>

19:46.280 --> 19:47.884
<i>if you're working,
put down your work.</i>

19:47.960 --> 19:49.883
<i>If you're having dinner,
stop having dinner.</i>

19:50.000 --> 19:53.607
<i>Because you are going to want
to witness this tonight.</i>

19:54.480 --> 19:56.403
<i>There has been
rampant speculation</i>

19:56.480 --> 19:59.689
<i>about what really happened
in the Quarter Quell.</i>

20:00.080 --> 20:04.563
<i>And here to shed
a little light on the subject for
us is a very special guest.</i>

20:04.680 --> 20:08.366
<i>Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.</i>

20:09.440 --> 20:14.651
<i>Peeta, a lot of people
feel as though they are in the dark.</i>

20:14.720 --> 20:16.802
<i>Yeah, I know how they feel.</i>

20:16.960 --> 20:19.008
<i>Now, so set the stage for us.</i>

20:19.120 --> 20:24.889
<i>Talk us through what really happened
on that final and controversial night.</i>

20:24.960 --> 20:29.170
<i>Well, first off, you have to understand
that when you're in the Games</i>

20:30.320 --> 20:33.005
<i>you only get one wish.
It's very costly.</i>

20:33.160 --> 20:34.200
You're alive.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.281
<i>It costs your life.</i>

20:35.360 --> 20:36.566
<i>I think it costs more than your life.</i>

20:36.640 --> 20:38.244
<i>How do you mean?
What's more than your life?</i>

20:38.320 --> 20:42.644
<i>I mean to murder innocent people,
that costs everything that you are.</i>

20:42.800 --> 20:43.881
Yes.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.129
<i>So you hold on
to that one wish.</i>

20:47.920 --> 20:50.366
<i>And that night my wish
was to save Katniss.</i>

20:50.480 --> 20:51.561
Yes.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.930
<i>I should've just run off with her
earlier in the day like she'd wanted.</i>

20:55.000 --> 20:56.604
<i>But you didn't.</i>

20:56.680 --> 20:59.809
<i>Why?
Were you caught up in Beetee's plan?</i>

21:00.200 --> 21:03.090
<i>No, I was caught up
trying to play allies.</i>

21:03.840 --> 21:05.842
<i>And then they separated us</i>

21:07.880 --> 21:09.120
<i>and that's when I lost her.</i>

21:11.040 --> 21:12.690
<i>And then the lightning hit</i>

21:12.840 --> 21:16.561
<i>and the whole force field
around the arena just blew out.</i>

21:16.960 --> 21:18.246
<i>Yes, but, Peeta,</i>

21:18.320 --> 21:21.608
<i>Katniss is the one
who blew it out.</i>

21:21.680 --> 21:22.681
No.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.801
<i>You saw the footage.</i>

21:23.880 --> 21:26.167
<i>No, she didn't know
what she was doing.</i>

21:26.240 --> 21:27.480
<i>Neither of us knew</i>

21:27.560 --> 21:29.927
<i>there was a bigger plan
going on. We had no idea.</i>

21:30.000 --> 21:31.081
- You had no <i>idea?</i>
- No.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.482
<i>All right. Well, Peeta,
there are many who find this suspicious</i>

21:34.560 --> 21:35.971
<i>- to say the least.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

21:36.040 --> 21:40.045
<i>It seems as though
she was part of a rebel plan.</i>

21:40.480 --> 21:44.166
<i>Do you think it was part of her plan
to be almost killed by Johanna?</i>

21:44.280 --> 21:46.965
<i>Or part of the plan
to be paralyzed by lightning?</i>

21:47.040 --> 21:51.284
<i>No, we were not part of any rebel plan.
We had no idea what was going on.</i>

21:51.560 --> 21:55.281
<i>All right. I believe you,
Peeta Mellark. Thank you.</i>

21:55.360 --> 21:56.361
Yeah.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.681
<i>And I was going
to ask you to speak about the unrest</i>

21:58.760 --> 22:01.081
<i>but I think you might be too upset.</i>

22:01.400 --> 22:02.561
<i>No, I can.</i>

22:02.680 --> 22:04.409
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

22:04.480 --> 22:05.606
Thank you.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.042
<i>I want everyone
who's watching to stop</i>

22:14.120 --> 22:17.249
<i>and to think about
what a civil war could mean.</i>

22:17.560 --> 22:19.961
<i>We almost went extinct once before.</i>

22:20.040 --> 22:21.804
<i>And now our numbers
are even fewer.</i>

22:21.880 --> 22:22.880
He's one of them.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.081
<i>Is this really what
we wanna do?</i>

22:24.160 --> 22:25.161
He's a traitor.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.805
<i>Kill ourselves off?</i>

22:26.880 --> 22:28.769
<i>Killing is not the answer.</i>

22:28.840 --> 22:30.524
I can't believe he's doing this.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.680
<i>Everyone needs to
lay down their weapons immediately.</i>

22:32.960 --> 22:34.200
Traitor!

22:34.280 --> 22:35.850
He's not one of us!

22:35.920 --> 22:37.445
This is treason!

22:38.280 --> 22:40.442
<i>Are you calling for a ceasefire?</i>

22:41.280 --> 22:43.089
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

22:43.160 --> 22:44.321
You're a puppet!

22:44.400 --> 22:45.526
Hang him!

22:45.600 --> 22:49.047
<i>I want everyone to stop
the senseless violence.</i>

22:49.280 --> 22:50.964
<i>This is not the path to change.</i>

22:51.040 --> 22:52.280
Traitor!

22:52.360 --> 22:55.204
<i>It's not the path to justice.</i>

23:18.320 --> 23:20.322
There can't be a ceasefire.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.208
Not after everything Snow's done.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.682
He could have done
a lot of damage tonight.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.128
Most districts,
people are still too afraid to join.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.565
They need the courage.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.330
Why do you think he said that?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.444
I don't know.
Maybe he was forced.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.529
He didn't look that bad.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.281
Maybe he made
some kind of deal to protect you.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.642
He's still playing the game.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.691
No! No! No!

24:11.200 --> 24:14.283
I'm sorry. It's just a nightmare.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.522
That's okay.
I get 'em, too.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.881
Peeta,

24:24.040 --> 24:25.565
will you stay with me?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.406
Yeah.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.641
Always.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.004
Hey.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.330
Can't sleep?

25:11.280 --> 25:13.282
Tell me what's happening.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.367
I'm good at keeping secrets.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.046
Even from Mom.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.327
No one hates the
Capitol more than me.

25:28.760 --> 25:32.003
And I wanna help.
But I just keep thinking,

25:33.480 --> 25:36.609
even if we win this war,
what happens to Peeta?

25:38.240 --> 25:41.562
I know he's not safe there,
but he's definitely not safe here.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.810
I don't think you know
how important you are to them.

25:45.880 --> 25:49.043
If you want something,
you just have to ask.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.611
You could demand almost anything.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.330
They'd have to agree to it.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.966
I should wake you up
more often, Little Duck.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.970
Get some sleep now.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.726
You, too.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.608
<i>Thank you for
agreeing to meet with me.</i>

26:15.280 --> 26:18.090
I've decided I'll be your Mockingjay.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.004
But I have some conditions.

26:27.320 --> 26:31.484
Peeta and the other Tributes,
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta,

26:31.800 --> 26:34.201
will be rescued at the
earliest opportunity.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.368
If and when Peeta is liberated,

26:36.600 --> 26:39.080
he will receive a full
and unconditional pardon.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.328
No punishment will be inflicted.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.210
And the same goes for
the other Tributes.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.966
No.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.605
It's not their fault
you abandoned them in the arena.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.967
They're doing and saying
whatever they can to survive.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.691
Individuals don't make demands in 13.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.883
There will be a tribunal.
And a fair judgment.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.005
Thank you.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.408
The Victors will be granted immunity.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.888
And you will announce that
in front of the entire population of 13.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.645
You will hold yourself
and your government responsible

27:12.720 --> 27:15.041
or you will find another Mockingjay.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.851
That's it. That's her.
Right there.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.483
Isn't that who I promised you?

27:20.560 --> 27:22.449
She wears the costume.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.205
Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.850
Our Mockingjay.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.766
Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.001
This is worth the risk.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.844
She's worth the risk.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.366
Pardons, tribunals.
Power of the people.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.966
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

27:40.920 --> 27:45.687
in wartime I think even
the noblest of causes
can be bent a little bit. Right?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.766
Do you have any other conditions?

27:58.160 --> 28:00.481
My sister gets to keep her cat.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.647
Go away.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.802
Is it visiting hours again?

28:25.360 --> 28:26.805
Miss Trinket,

28:28.160 --> 28:29.844
you see this door.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.806
It opens.
From the inside.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.808
I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.691
You're not a prisoner.
You're free to join the rest of 13.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.246
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.403
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.209
Katniss has agreed
to be The Mockingjay.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.691
That poor thing.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.411
And your Girl on
Fire is burnt out.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.767
I need you to
join this team now.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.043
I need someone she trusts.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.724
What about Haymitch?

29:00.840 --> 29:03.650
He's drying out in
some facility a mile down.

29:03.760 --> 29:07.321
Aiding rebels is
not really my forte.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.803
Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,

29:12.120 --> 29:14.248
no matter what happens here.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.924
If you wanna play
a prisoner of war, fine.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.604
Stay here and rot.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.961
I'll find someone else
to be The Mockingjay's escort.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.281
Who?

29:26.920 --> 29:30.925
Anyone can be replaced.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.044
Not your Mockingjay.

29:36.160 --> 29:39.721
There isn't a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.931
You honestly believe
one of these cave dwellers

29:45.000 --> 29:47.002
is going to take my place?

29:47.960 --> 29:49.166
No.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.725
Good afternoon.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.721
Thank you for interrupting your schedules.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.922
<i>They have already
been adjusted to compensate for the delay.</i>

30:14.080 --> 30:15.640
I hardly ever see children around here.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.808
<i>Please, check in with your unit supervisors
when you resume work.</i>

30:17.880 --> 30:20.645
A lot of them were
lost in an epidemic a few years ago.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.006
<i>I have an announcement
for the citizens of 13.</i>

30:22.080 --> 30:23.570
Coin lost her family, too.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.565
Daughter and a husband.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.007
<i>And our welcome guests from 12.</i>

30:28.400 --> 30:32.325
Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause

30:33.040 --> 30:36.169
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

30:37.040 --> 30:42.126
In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.

30:43.120 --> 30:47.682
First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

30:48.280 --> 30:50.442
held hostage in the Capitol.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.761
Peeta Mellark...

30:56.080 --> 30:57.525
Johanna Mason...

30:58.200 --> 30:59.531
Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.489
...and Annie Cresta.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.966
Once freed,

31:04.040 --> 31:06.964
they will be granted full pardon
for any and all crimes

31:07.040 --> 31:08.451
committed against the rebel cause.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.081
Good.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.484
That's good, Katniss.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.485
If Katniss Everdeen fails
to fulfill her duties

31:20.960 --> 31:22.644
the deal will be off.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.729
Thank you for your attention.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.326
Please, resume your daily schedules.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.247
Madam President.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.526
Effie Trinket.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.171
Welcome to 13.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.484
Madam President,
may I say you are so very

31:39.400 --> 31:40.890
- concise.
- Mmm.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.210
You believe that
there's more to be said?

31:43.880 --> 31:44.881
May I speak freely?

31:44.960 --> 31:46.849
You don't appear to
do anything else.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.211
I'm only talking about salesmanship.

31:50.920 --> 31:54.208
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.169
They need to be nurtured
with a little kindling

31:56.240 --> 31:58.561
and warmth.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.241
Bit of oxygen.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.685
Oxygen.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.846
One sure way to put
it out is to smother it.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.605
Or to use up all
the air in the room.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.045
Excuse me.

32:11.680 --> 32:15.321
You know what could use
a revolution? That hair.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.801
Effie?

32:19.200 --> 32:20.361
Oh!

32:23.640 --> 32:25.005
What are you doing here?

32:25.240 --> 32:26.651
I'm a political refugee.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.811
Plutarch rescued you?

32:28.880 --> 32:31.042
Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.206
You and I were both in the dark.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.046
Now I'm condemned
to this life of jumpsuits.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.401
It is wonderful to see you again.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.808
Can you believe this place?

32:46.200 --> 32:47.804
I miss coffee.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.971
I never knew anyplace
could be so strict.

32:52.040 --> 32:56.329
I mean, I thought at least
in the higher ranks there'd be some

32:57.440 --> 32:58.930
side action.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.243
I miss my wigs.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.322
Luckily, I remembered
that this was all the rage

33:03.400 --> 33:05.004
when I was coming up.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.163
You know, everything old
can be made new again.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.850
Like democracy.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.489
Which brings me to this.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.210
Cinna.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.409
He's dead, isn't he?

33:32.640 --> 33:34.005
Yes, dear.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.686
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

33:40.760 --> 33:43.650
until you'd decided
to be The Mockingjay on your own.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.363
He knew the risks.
As we all do.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.291
He believed in this revolution.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.884
He believed in you.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.644
They're beautiful.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.405
They have it.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.281
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.440
There's not much of
a prep team here in 13

34:09.520 --> 34:11.284
but we will make you

34:12.800 --> 34:15.485
the best-dressed rebel in history.

34:19.639 --> 34:20.880
Okay.

34:22.239 --> 34:23.366
Bring up the lights.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.250
Cinna's final touch.

34:47.679 --> 34:51.002
Everyone's either gonna
wanna kiss you, kill you,

34:51.080 --> 34:52.570
or be you.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.527
<i>Perfect.</i>

34:55.600 --> 34:56.965
<i>Absolutely perfect.</i>

34:57.240 --> 34:59.686
Okay.
Let's bring up the setting.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.001
Huh.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.645
<i>Little Wind.</i>

35:09.520 --> 35:12.444
<i>Okay, Katniss,
we're gonna start you down on one knee.</i>

35:12.520 --> 35:14.409
<i>- Okay.
- And as you rise up,</i>

35:14.560 --> 35:18.042
<i>you're gonna hold
your flag in the air and deliver your line.</i>

35:18.120 --> 35:21.841
<i>And remember you've just stormed
the outskirts of the Capitol</i>

35:21.920 --> 35:23.600
<i>arm-in-arm with your brothers and sisters.</i>

35:24.040 --> 35:25.041
Okay.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.601
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

35:31.840 --> 35:35.162
People of Panem, we fight, we dare, we...

35:37.880 --> 35:38.881
<i>Does she know the line?</i>

35:38.960 --> 35:40.724
- I know it. I got it. I'm sorry.
<i>- Okay,</i> All right.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.484
- Let's do <i>it</i> again.
- She's warming up.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.370
<i>All right. With energy. Go.</i>

35:46.200 --> 35:47.850
People of Panem, we fight!

35:47.920 --> 35:51.766
We dare to end this
hunger for justice!

35:52.320 --> 35:54.482
<i>You've just been in battle!</i>

35:54.560 --> 35:57.325
<i>I'm sorry.
Excuse my outburst.</i>

35:57.400 --> 36:00.006
<i>You've just been in battle.</i>

36:00.880 --> 36:02.041
Let's try it again.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.845
Whenever you're ready.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.842
People of Panem, we fight!

36:06.920 --> 36:11.608
We dare to end this
hunger for justice.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.571
And that, my friends,
is how a revolution dies.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.765
Hello, Katniss.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.766
This how you greet an old friend?

36:38.440 --> 36:40.647
Maybe I don't recognize you sober.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.691
I guess it looks as bad as it feels.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.491
<i>People of Panem, we fight!</i>

36:49.640 --> 36:53.326
<i>We dare!
We end this hunger for justice!</i>

37:04.200 --> 37:06.248
Uh, Madam President,

37:06.320 --> 37:08.971
indulge me for a moment, if you would.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.566
Let's everybody
think of one incident

37:11.640 --> 37:14.644
where Katniss Everdeen
genuinely moved you.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.401
Not where you were
jealous of her hairstyle

37:17.480 --> 37:20.051
or her dress went up in flames

37:20.120 --> 37:23.169
or she made a halfway
decent shot with an arrow.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.846
And not where Peeta
made you like her.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.440
No, I'd like you all to
think of one moment

37:29.520 --> 37:32.729
- where she made you feel something real.
- Oh.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.524
When she volunteered
for her sister at the Reaping.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.362
Excellent example.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.966
Okay.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.369
I hope that wasn't important.

37:44.440 --> 37:49.480
Uh... Okay. "Volunteer for sister."

37:49.680 --> 37:51.489
Good.
What else?

37:51.560 --> 37:54.245
Oh.
When she sang that song for little Rue.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.163
Oh, yeah.
Who didn't get choked up at that?

37:58.360 --> 38:01.204
You know, I like you better, Effie,
without all that makeup.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.521
Well, I like you better sober.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.527
When she chose Rue
as an ally, as well.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.364
Mmm, yes.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.886
Now, what do
all these have in common?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.328
No one told her what to do.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.129
Unscripted, yes.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.171
So maybe we should
just leave her alone.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.288
And wash her face.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.562
She's still a girl.
You made her look 35.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.804
The opportunities
for spontaneity are obviously

38:24.880 --> 38:26.689
lacking below ground.

38:26.960 --> 38:31.010
So what you're suggesting
is we toss her into combat?

38:31.680 --> 38:33.842
I can't sanction
putting an untrained civilian

38:33.920 --> 38:35.922
in battle just for effect.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.485
This is not the Capitol.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.450
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
Put her in the field.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.681
No, we can't protect her.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.364
It has to come from her.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.408
That's what people respond to.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.131
You want a symbol for the revolution?

38:48.240 --> 38:50.561
She cannot be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.922
Maybe
there's someplace that's less dangerous.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.526
District 8.
They reported heavy bombing last week.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.000
There are no military targets left.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.240
We can't guarantee her safety.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.045
You'll never be able
to guarantee my safety.

39:01.760 --> 39:02.921
I wanna go.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.725
And if you're killed?

39:06.120 --> 39:07.849
Make sure you
get it on camera.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.446
I've made you some surprises.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.248
Maybe you wanna try one out.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.965
If you're gonna be
a part of Katniss' propo team,

39:25.040 --> 39:27.281
you may as well look the part.

39:40.960 --> 39:44.601
And this one is for you.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.049
Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon

39:49.120 --> 39:50.246
for the sake of the propos

39:50.320 --> 39:53.767
but I couldn't
just make you a fashion accessory.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.171
It's beautiful.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.284
And look here.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.008
Regular. Incendiary.
Explosive arrows.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.480
All color-coded.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.602
And tell Finnick

40:16.680 --> 40:18.728
I've got a trident for him

40:18.800 --> 40:20.370
when he's ready.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.531
Might just cheer him...
Cheer him up.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.761
Uh...

40:25.840 --> 40:29.481
Let's not fire
the red ones in here.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.882
You had all of this and you just
left the districts to fend for themselves?

40:52.560 --> 40:55.962
It's not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.805
We weren't in any kind of shape
to launch a counterattack.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.566
Yeah,
we could've bombed the Capitol

41:00.680 --> 41:03.206
but they would've retaliated
with at least twice the firepower.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.361
Then what?

41:05.960 --> 41:08.691
There would've
been nobody left to claim victory.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.287
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said
and then you all called him a traitor.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.050
This way, soldier.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.562
You are camera-ready.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.968
Doesn't your comrade look handsome?

41:28.000 --> 41:29.286
Let's go.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.324
Come back safe.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.963
Quick introductions, Katniss.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.887
These people have come a long way
to support the cause.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.007
This is Cressida.

41:41.080 --> 41:44.289
In my opinion one of the best
up-and-coming directors in the Capitol.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.727
Until I up and left.
Hey.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.166
Hey-

41:48.240 --> 41:49.287
Let's see what you can do.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.401
All right.
Be careful.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.042
This is my assistant, Messalla.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.565
It's an honor to meet you.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.688
And your cameramen over there, Castor.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.841
Hello.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.001
And Pollux.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.365
Let's get locked in.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.726
You're all from the Capitol?

42:12.840 --> 42:14.046
Plutarch got you out?

42:14.120 --> 42:16.202
Don't expect
much chitchat from him.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.046
He's an Avox.
Capitol cut his tongue out years ago.

42:20.120 --> 42:24.603
And, no, it wasn't any sort of rescue,
if that's what you mean.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.803
We all fled on our own.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.451
For this.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.001
<i>For you.</i>

43:02.880 --> 43:04.882
This has gotta be fast.
In and out.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.361
Move out.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.442
You're alive then.
We weren't sure.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.522
Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.449
Katniss has been recovering,
but she insisted on coming out

43:42.520 --> 43:43.646
<i>and seein' some of your wounded.</i>

43:43.720 --> 43:45.131
Well, we've got plenty of those.

43:55.560 --> 44:00.487
We have a mass grave
a few blocks west, but, I can't spare
the manpower to move them yet.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.043
Hospital's past that curtain.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.487
Any hope you can give them,
it's worth it.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.530
The Capitol's done
everything they can to break us.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.202
Aren't you worried
about having all your wounded in one place?

44:11.400 --> 44:13.480
I think it's better
than leaving them to die.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.166
That's not what I meant.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.322
Well, that's my only other option.

44:17.720 --> 44:20.610
You can come up
with another, I'm all ears.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.968
It's right through here.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.089
Don't film me in there.
I can't help them.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.728
Just let them see your face.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.961
Huh?

44:58.120 --> 44:59.610
Excuse me.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.647
Yeah. You all right?

45:08.640 --> 45:10.130
It's okay.
Here, it's okay.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.885
I've got you.
It's all right.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.124
Katniss Everdeen?

45:48.440 --> 45:50.408
What are you doing here?

45:51.680 --> 45:53.523
I came to see you.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.801
What about the baby?

46:02.880 --> 46:04.405
I lost it.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.767
Are you fighting, Katniss?

46:08.840 --> 46:10.285
You here to fight with us?

46:11.640 --> 46:12.880
I am.

46:14.640 --> 46:15.971
I will.

46:36.080 --> 46:37.320
Tighter.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.724
Tighter, tighter.

46:47.920 --> 46:51.811
Sir, some cameras
were damaged in the bombings,

46:51.880 --> 46:55.168
but we confirmed it's her.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.006
Zoom in.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.888
She was visiting
a makeshift hospital.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.440
We're not sure
if she's still there.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.081
Hmm.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.600
We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.967
We may be able to target her.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.486
Hmm.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.446
Kill the wounded.

47:23.680 --> 47:24.966
Sir...

47:26.440 --> 47:29.205
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.927
Any association with the Mockingjay symbol
is forbidden.

47:36.200 --> 47:39.682
Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.

47:41.920 --> 47:46.323
Show them what it costs
to be friends with Katniss Everdeen.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.764
Your mom's gonna be proud of you
when she sees the footage.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.205
Will this play in the districts?

47:51.400 --> 47:53.050
It'll be tattooed on their eyes.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.243
There's a problem.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.321
What kinda problem?

47:58.040 --> 47:59.724
Incoming bombers from the north.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.566
We need to find cover now.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.086
There's a bunker in there.

48:16.640 --> 48:18.369
Straight ahead and down the stairs.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.810
Katniss!

48:21.880 --> 48:23.166
Katniss!

48:24.520 --> 48:27.683
Everdeen!
Everdeen!

48:28.600 --> 48:30.204
Gale, back away from the wall!

48:46.160 --> 48:48.208
You okay?

48:54.080 --> 48:55.206
Move!

49:02.680 --> 49:04.360
They're going after
something to the south.

49:04.520 --> 49:05.681
That's towards the hospital.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.647
They're circling back around.
Come on!

49:51.680 --> 49:53.170
That's the hospital.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.561
They're targeting the hospital.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.288
Help them!

50:51.400 --> 50:53.084
Help them!
Get them out!

50:55.640 --> 50:56.971
Katniss?

50:57.840 --> 51:00.650
Katniss, can you tell everyone
what you're seeing right now?

51:04.080 --> 51:06.401
Katniss, what do you wanna say?

51:16.600 --> 51:19.444
I want the rebels to know that I'm alive.

51:20.040 --> 51:22.088
That I'm in District 8

51:22.160 --> 51:24.970
where the Capitol just bombed a hospital

51:25.320 --> 51:29.564
filled with unarmed men,
women and children.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.124
And there will be no survivors.

51:34.400 --> 51:39.406
If you think for one second
that the Capitol will ever treat us fairly

51:39.480 --> 51:41.528
you are lying to yourselves.

51:41.960 --> 51:45.009
Because we know who they are
and what they do.

51:45.120 --> 51:49.330
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.921
I have a message for President Snow.

51:57.680 --> 52:02.561
You can torture us and bomb us
and burn our districts to the ground.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.764
But do you see that?

52:07.040 --> 52:08.724
Fire is catching.

52:09.880 --> 52:13.851
And if we burn, you burn with us!

52:34.880 --> 52:37.611
We know who they are
and what they do.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.365
<i>This is what they do!</i>

52:40.560 --> 52:42.528
<i>And we must fight back.</i>

52:43.760 --> 52:47.207
<i>You can torture us and bomb us</i>

52:47.600 --> 52:49.841
<i>and burn our districts to the ground.</i>

52:49.920 --> 52:51.968
Plutarch's faith in you wasn't misplaced.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.087
<i>But do you see that?</i>

52:53.320 --> 52:54.526
Thank you.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.761
<i>Fire is catching.</i>

52:55.840 --> 52:57.410
Come up with me for the beginning.

52:57.600 --> 53:01.047
<i>And if we burn,
you burn with us!</i>

53:29.200 --> 53:32.363
There is no progress without compromise.

53:33.480 --> 53:36.165
No victory without sacrifice.

53:37.240 --> 53:40.210
But I stand here with The Mockingjay

53:40.600 --> 53:44.002
to announce that our moment has arrived.

54:10.080 --> 54:13.846
Beetee has increased
our use of the airwaves tenfold.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.810
We will broadcast this message

54:16.880 --> 54:19.247
to all the districts tonight.

54:19.320 --> 54:21.163
The Mockingjay's words

54:21.240 --> 54:25.040
inspiring everyone to join the rebellion.

54:25.360 --> 54:31.049
Together, we will become
an alliance to be reckoned with.

54:33.200 --> 54:37.489
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

54:40.560 --> 54:43.086
You don't like
hearing a fight song at a funeral, huh?

54:45.360 --> 54:48.603
The more people on our side,
the closer we are to Peeta and Annie.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.126
Yeah.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.287
<i>By order of President Snow</i>

55:15.360 --> 55:18.204
<i>daily production quotas
have been increased.</i>

55:18.680 --> 55:22.480
<i>All work shifts
will be extended by an extra two hours.</i>

55:23.000 --> 55:25.924
<i>Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.</i>

55:27.080 --> 55:32.325
<i>By order of President Snow daily
production quotas have been increased.</i>

56:17.920 --> 56:21.049
If we burn, you burn with us!

56:24.280 --> 56:25.725
Yeah!

56:26.240 --> 56:27.401
Whoo!

56:27.760 --> 56:29.125
Yeah!

56:50.160 --> 56:52.049
- I got good news.
- What?

56:52.120 --> 56:53.804
Coin agreed to let
us hunt above ground.

57:45.840 --> 57:47.888
He's not even afraid of us.

57:49.960 --> 57:52.361
It's 'cause they've never
been hunted before.

57:54.560 --> 57:56.403
It's almost not fair.

59:08.840 --> 59:10.649
They want us back.

59:25.400 --> 59:26.845
They asked us to
head for Command.

59:26.920 --> 59:29.400
All right.
I gotta drop these off.

59:34.360 --> 59:38.968
<i>She was arguably
our favorite Tribute.</i>

59:39.360 --> 59:43.331
<i>And I think that's what
we all find most astonishing,</i>

59:43.480 --> 59:48.247
<i>is that this girl was
adored in the Capitol.</i>

59:49.160 --> 59:50.764
<i>And I think for you, Peeta,</i>

59:50.960 --> 59:53.566
<i>it must be particularly painful.</i>

59:54.480 --> 59:56.847
<i>I wish I could give
this rose to you, Katniss.</i>

59:56.960 --> 59:59.281
He's changed so much already.
What are they doing to him?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.091
<i>A sweet gesture
for a girl who has inspired</i>

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.884
<i>such violence.</i>

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.010
<i>You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.</i>

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.121
He's shaking.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.406
<i>I don't think that I could.</i>

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.809
<i>Unless, of course, Peeta,
you think that perhaps she's being</i>

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.686
<i>forced into saying</i>

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.047
<i>things that she doesn't even understand.</i>

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.686
<i>Yeah. That's exactly what I think.</i>

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.046
Even his voice is different.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.726
<i>I think they're using her
to whip up the rebels.</i>

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.883
<i>I doubt she even
knows what's happening.</i>

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.885
<i>And what's really at stake.</i>

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.890
<i>Now, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels
will ever let her see this.</i>

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.046
<i>But if they do, what would you say to her?</i>

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.729
<i>To Katniss Everdeen,
the once sweet Katniss Everdeen.</i>

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.321
<i>I would tell her
to think for herself.</i>

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.250
Yes.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.731
<i>Don't be a fool, Katniss.</i>

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.243
<i>I know you never
wanted the rebellion.</i>

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:59.044
<i>The things that you did in
the Games were never intended
to start all of this.</i>

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.601
<i>The rebels have made you
into something that you're not.</i>

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.001
<i>Something that could destroy all of us.</i>

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.368
<i>So if you have any power or any say</i>

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.207
<i>in what they do or how they use you,</i>

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.408
<i>please, please,
urge them to stop this war</i>

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.090
<i>before it's too late.</i>

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.766
<i>And ask yourself,</i>

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.444
<i>can you trust the people
you're working with?</i>

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.686
<i>Do you know what they really want?</i>

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.161
We need to respond.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.083
<i>Thank you,
Peeta Mellark, for these</i>

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.448
<i>revelations about the real Mockingjay.</i>

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.244
Did you see what he looks like?

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.526
I saw a coward.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.250
You don't have any idea
what he's going through.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.608
I don't care.
I would never say what he just said.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.520
Not if they tortured me.
Not with a gun to my head.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.604
That is the same Peeta
that defended you at the whipping post.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.570
No, it's not.
Now he's only defending himself.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.603
Coin's called a meeting.
We need to respond.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.206
When did "we"
become you and Coin?

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.044
Everyone has a choice.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.407
How can he sit there
in the Capitol and defend the people

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.847
who destroyed his home
and murdered his family?

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.170
He doesn't know.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.685
How could he?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.525
Nobody's seen what
the Capitol did to 12.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.485
I have to show them.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.128
So I wanna start with you
in front of the Justice Building, okay?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.170
Bang. First shot.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.802
Katniss, tell us what happened here.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.289
We were all standin' right here

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.726
watchin' the Games
when you fired that arrow.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.001
The screens just went dark.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.440
Nobody had any idea what happened.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.840
Peacekeepers forced us
back into our homes.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.883
For maybe an hour,
the town was just dead quiet.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.485
Little past 9:00,
we heard their trucks pullin' out.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.641
All of them.
Every single Peacekeeper.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.884
And I knew what that meant.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.605
Me and a couple of guys from the mines,

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.489
we started pulling people
from their houses

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.403
and tried to get 'em to the fence line

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.448
but a lotta people were
scared of the forest.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.244
So they headed up onto the road.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.444
Make a break for it that way.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.763
Stay with Gale.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.845
915 of us
made it to the fence.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.560
Then we watched
as bombers circled back towards the road.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.966
They firebombed them as they ran away.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.491
915 outta 10,000.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.050
I should've grabbed people.
I should've dragged 'em with me.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.845
Some of the kids I could've carried.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.446
You saved
so many people, Gale.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.768
Without you,
there would be no District 12.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.569
Not even the memory of it.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.329
This is where you kissed me.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.840
I didn't think you remembered that.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.167
I'd have to be dead to forget that.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.291
Maybe not even then.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.610
I knew you'd do that.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.684
How? I didn't.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.324
'Cause I'm in pain.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.651
That's the only way
that I can get your attention.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.250
Don't worry, Katniss. It'll pass.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.327
Hey-

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.368
Yeah, that's a mockingjay.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.928
Well, now they'll never shut up.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.731
You want me to sing?

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:49.011
<i>Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</i>

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.166
<i>Where they strung up a man</i>

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.761
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.851
<i>Strange things did happen here</i>

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.843
<i>No stranger would it be</i>

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:05.321
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:11.080
<i>Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</i>

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.566
<i>Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.600
<i>Strange things did happen here</i>

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.921
<i>No stranger would it be</i>

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:27.399
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.046
<i>Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</i>

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:38.446
<i>Where I told you to run
so we'd both be free</i>

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.566
<i>Strange things did happen here</i>

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.721
<i>No stranger would it be</i>

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:49.286
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.884
<i>Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</i>

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.563
<i>Wear a necklace of hope
side by side with me</i>

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.881
That line was originally
"necklace of rope."

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.486
I had it changed to "necklace of hope."

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.642
Wow. You are a true wordsmith.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.801
Little on the nose, but,
of course, so is war.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.723
Every district's seeing this?

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.609
Yes. But not the Capitol.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.970
I designed this
signal defense system for them.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.923
But I can't find my way through it.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.288
Guess I did my job too well.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.247
At the time, I was just thinking
of the science of it all.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.970
We'll get through it.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.767
<i>Are you, are you
comin' to the tree?</i>

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.403
<i>Where they strung up a man
they say who murdered three</i>

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.841
<i>Strange things did happen here</i>

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.048
<i>No stranger would it be</i>

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:47.002
<i>If we met at midnight
in the hanging tree</i>

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.728
<i>Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</i>

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.728
<i>Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.082
<i>Strange things did happen here</i>

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.367
<i>No stranger would it be</i>

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.407
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.566
Moves and countermoves.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.729
Katniss, you're wanted in Command.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.169
<i>Tonight,
we've received reports</i>

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.765
<i>of derailed trains,</i>

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.289
<i>of granaries on fire,</i>

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.608
<i>and of a savage attack
on the hydroelectric dam in District 5.</i>

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.489
Oh, what have they done to you?

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.640
<i>I'm begging for restraint and decency.</i>

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.604
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled horse manure

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.205
to bring you...

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.086
<i>Comin' to the tree?</i>

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.400
That's it.
That's our footage.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.720
Beetee's in.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.962
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.321
<i>Katniss?</i>

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.925
He sees it.
He sees our propo.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.891
<i>No stranger would it</i> be...

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.767
<i>Katniss, are you there?</i>

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.291
Peeta.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.449
<i>Katniss?</i>

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.127
<i>Peeta, please continue.</i>

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.165
<i>You were telling us about</i>

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.526
<i>these savage attacks.</i>

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.011
Yeah.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.603
<i>The attack on the dam was a callous</i>

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.969
<i>and inhuman act of destruction...</i>

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:52.168
<i>Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.641
<i>Think about it.</i>

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.765
<i>How will this end?
What Will be left?</i>

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.044
<i>No one can survive this.</i>

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.851
<i>No one is safe now.</i>

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.770
<i>Not here in the Capitol.</i>

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.850
<i>Not in any of the districts.</i>

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.486
<i>They're coming, Katniss.</i>

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.891
<i>They're gonna kill everyone.</i>

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.883
<i>And in District 13 you'll
be dead by morning.</i>

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.248
He's warning us.
That was a warning.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.880
Yes, it was.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.331
We have to get him
out before they kill him.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.521
Is there anything in the air?

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.761
Nothing on Doppler, ma'am.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.684
He was in the mansion.
He could have overheard something.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.086
Possibly.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.165
It's time
for an air raid drill.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.643
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.165
<i>Please, remain calm</i>

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.561
<i>and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.843
Prim! Prim!

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.003
<i>Proceed to your nearest stairwell
and descend to level 40.</i>

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.404

<i>and descend to level 40.</i>

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.520
Madam President,

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.444
three Capitol squadrons
just entered our airspace.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.531
How much time do we have?

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.284
They're a few seconds from range.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.965
Prepare to scramble the fleet.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.041
Copy that.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.283
Open up short-range air defense.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.689
Arm long-range missiles for counterattack.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.445
<i>Blast doors will be
sealed in five minutes.</i>

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.043
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.806
<i>Please, remain calm

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.283
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion

<i>Blast doors will

<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

<i>Please, remain calm

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.403

<i>Continue to the Supply Station

<i>Please keep all personal items

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.286
<i>Be courteous to your fellow citizens.</i>

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.488
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.530
<i>All citizens should
be inside the bunker.</i>

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.090
<i>- Blast doors will close in two minutes.
- Mom</i>!

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.201
Where's Prim?

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.964
I thought she went to find you.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.371
She must still
be on the stairs.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.965
There's no one on the stairs.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.125
She went back for the cat.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.242
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.647
<i>All citizens should be inside the bunker.</i>

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.721
Hey, stop! Stop!

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.883
<i>Blast doors will close in one minute.</i>

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.970
They hit the far edge
of the northwest quadrant.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.371
Penetrated 40 feet.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.566
Missed the living quarters.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.722
Only minor damage to corridors 2 and 3.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.040
Is there any radiation?

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.121
None detected.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.043
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.128
<i>Blast doors will close in 30 seconds.</i>

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.202
Prim!

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.687
Prim!

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.125
Katniss!

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.610
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.761
Katniss!

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.366
<i>Blast doors will close in 15 seconds.</i>

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.771
Get down here!

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.128
<i>- Hurry!
- This is</i> a <i>code red alert.</i>

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.727
<i>Blast doors will close in 10 seconds.</i>

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.441
Nine...

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.601
<i>Eight...</i>

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.801
Seven...

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.321
Six...

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.889
- Five...
- Hold the doors!

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.446
<i>Four...</i>

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.246
<i>Three...</i>

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.369
- Two...
- Wait! Hold the doors!

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.411
One.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.167
You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.009
I wasn't gonna
leave him behind.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.445
I couldn't live with myself.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.402
<i>Blast doors are now sealed.</i>

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.970
I know, Prim.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.366
Let's go.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.483
Damage to the aquifer
in the northwest quadrant.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.164
We lost a transport corridor.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.924
There's nothing else in the northwest.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.480
Our surface-to-air
launchers just took

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.409
a direct hit in sector 3.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.084
Because we revealed ourselves.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.322
They saw us firing there.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.449
Stand down.
Don't launch the fleet.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:25.003
Another 12 Capitol bombers
approaching sector 3 in attack formation.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.367
Hold fire on their approach.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.881
Oh.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.641
What'd they hit?

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.961
Bedrock. But there's debris
in the ventilation shaft.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.525
They're not targeting our fleet.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.806
Or our Special Weaponry.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.962
They don't know
what we have or where we have it.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.402
Can you confirm
that everyone's safely in the bunker?

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.561
Already done.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.091
Conceal all remaining
anti-aircraft guns.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.806
Seal launching pads
and ventilation corridors.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.809
We are gonna wait this out.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.291
This is what we're built for.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.562
They'll seal us in here like a tomb.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.769
The Capitol's working off
some outdated information.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.200
I'd rather not update it for them.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.602
Madam President, I know
it's not my place...

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.600
It's not. You're a welcome guest,
but you're out of your depth down here.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.891
Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.041
Copy that.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.963
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.451
It's gonna be a long night.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.931
Prim, talk about something.
Anything.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.921
They promoted me at the hospital.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.125
I forgot to tell you.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.600
They're training me to be a doctor.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.524
They'd be stupid not to.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.201
Hey-

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.561
Can I sit?

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.887
Yeah.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.880
Snow's using Annie to punish you.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.322
He's taunting us with them.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:43.209
I didn't understand until just now
watching that stupid cat.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.727
After your first Games,

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.727
I thought the whole
romance was an act.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.769
We all expected you
to continue that strategy.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.080
But it wasn't until Peeta's heart stopped
and he nearly died that

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.921
I knew I'd misjudged you.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.965
You love him.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.366
I'm not saying in what way.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.204
Maybe you don't even know yourself.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.085
But anyone paying attention can see it.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.083
How do you live with it?

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:32.251
I drag myself outta nightmares
and there's no relief in waking up.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.050
But it's better not to give in to it.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.327
Takes 10 times longer
to put yourself back together

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.482
than it does to fall apart.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.769
Katniss? Katniss?

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.846
Come with me.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.960
We took their best shot.
Didn't we?

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.606
Yeah.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.924
Your mother and sister okay?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.286
Yeah, they're fine.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.687
I need you to do something for us.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.046
I need you to tell Panem
that we survived an attack by the Capitol

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.963
with no casualties.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.606
And we remain fully operational.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.641
Okay.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.890
You should know something.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.491
We had eight extra minutes
of civilian evacuation

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.642
because of Peeta's warning.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.884
I won't forget that.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.491
Thank you.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.250
So Katniss,

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.807
it's "13 is alive and well and so am l."

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.487
Katniss?

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.364
Katniss.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.890
Never one to waste it
in rehearsal, I know.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.923
Why would they drop these?

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.600
For me.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.287
Ready to go, Katniss?

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.242
We're gonna do this,
just like District 8.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.562
Tell me about the roses.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.128
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.805
He's gonna kill Peeta.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.160
Let's try again.
Can you speak up?

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.651
We don't have a mic on you.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.521
"13 is alive and well and so am l."

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.763
He's gonna kill Peeta.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800
I can't.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.490
Katniss?

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.921
You can do it, Katniss.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.361
I can't do this.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.603
"13 is alive
and well and so am l."

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.484
He's just gonna keep...

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.766
He's never gonna stop.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.080
Cressida, we should cut the cameras.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.525
- ...as long as I'm The Mockingjay.
- It's okay, Katniss.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.763
No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.004
He's doing this because
I'm The Mockingjay.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.560
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.761
No.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.686
No, I can't do this.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.960
Katniss.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.241
Don't make me do this!

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.321
Let her go.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.763
I gotta get out of here.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.207
So this is the end, huh?

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.566
I s'pose you're
just gonna hide down here forever?

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.847
I can't be The Mockingjay.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.409
Not The Mockingjay.
Just Katniss.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.568
You know, you're the only
real friend I have down here.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.728
I don't suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.881
You're unbelievable.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.406
Okay, but I meant what I said.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.488
Look, the reason I'm here
is to let you know

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.685
they're rescuing Peeta.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.407
What?

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.121
The dam went down in District 5,
took out most of the power to the Capitol.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.123
Knocked out their signal defense.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.370
Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.280
A window is open to us.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.521
How much longer?
I don't know.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.291
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.600
And President Coin?

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.729
You know, I can never
fully support that woman

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:06.840
in light of the prohibition
they have going on around this place,

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.611
but Plutarch got word

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.286
that Peeta and the others
are in the Tribute Center.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.683
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.530
She knows that Peeta

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.001
is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you're ours.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.562
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.644
she's going to get him.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.521
I have to go help.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.602
Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo.
Wait.

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.888
Come on. What, are you just
gonna jump outta the vent

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.246
and go storm the Capitol?

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.448
Besides, it's already underway.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.409
Six soldiers went in.
Volunteer only.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.042
And guess who was
the first brave soul to sign up.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.131
Gale.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.524
- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:00.806
Go in the center there.
Those rocks.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.482
Castor, to left.

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.290
Pollux, you're with me.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.603
So we'll go straight to camera.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.366
Okay?
Finnick?

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.487
Yeah.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.360
Okay.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.205
Take your time.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.931
Just remember
to keep talking and don't stop.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.563
This is Finnick Odair.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.730
<i>Winner
of the 65th Hunger Games.</i>

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.441
<i>And I'm coming to you
from District 13, alive and well.</i>

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.285
<i>We've survived an assault from the Capitol.</i>

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.371
<i>But I'm not here to
give you recent news.</i>

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.449
Why is Finnick doing a propo?

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.290
It's a lot more than that.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.328
Beetee's commandeered the system.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.243
Now that they're down to generator power

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.402
there's a more limited
range of frequencies available to them.

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.369
And I'm filling them all up with Finnick.

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.124
Not many will see it,
but whoever does

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.400
will think it's another propo.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.130
What they don't know
is this broadcast

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:58.929
is jamming their entire system with noise.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.731
Early defense warning,
internal communications, everything.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.840
As long as the
broadcast goes through,

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.281
our team should be
able to get in and out undetected.

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:09.490
<i>The truth.
Not the myths about a life of luxury.</i>

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.723
<i>Not the lie about glory
for your homeland.</i>

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.002
<i>You can survive the arena.</i>

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.647
<i>The moment you leave, you're a slave.</i>

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.968
<i>Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One,</i>

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.247
<i>you are one minute out
from perimeter defense.</i>

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.446
Going dark.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.120
<i>Stay low in case they're online.</i>

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.446
<i>President Snow used to sell me.</i>

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.803
<i>Or my body, at least.
I wasn't the only one.</i>

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.281
<i>If a Victor is considered desirable,</i>

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.569
<i>the President gives them
as a reward or allows people to buy them.</i>

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.684
<i>If you refuse, he kills someone you love.</i>

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.043
Mockingjay One,
you are 20 seconds from perimeter defense.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.040
Ten seconds.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.929
Nine... Eight...

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.244
<i>Seven... Six... Five...</i>

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:13.730
Four... Three... Two...

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.726
One.

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.690
<i>No response
from perimeter defense.</i>

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.364
<i>We're inside Capitol airspace.</i>

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.040
<i>To make themselves feel better,</i>

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.321
<i>my patrons would
make presents of money or jewelry.</i>

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.568
<i>But I found a much more
valuable form of payment.</i>

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.847
<i>Secrets.</i>

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.286
Gear up.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.968
Switching 110 Night View.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.291
There.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.766
Command,
we have visual on the Tribute Center.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.842
<i>Initiating final approach.</i>

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:24.720
Masks on.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.607
<i>See, I know all the depravity,
the deceit and the cruelty</i>

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.047
<i>of the Capitol's pampered elite.</i>

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.284
<i>But the biggest secrets are about
our good President, Coriolanus Snow.</i>

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.406
Open the door.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.525
<i>Command, this is Team Leader.</i>

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.729
<i>Prepare to deploy gas.
We will confirm once inside.</i>

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.204
<i>Such</i> a <i>young man
when he rose to power.</i>

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:11.850
<i>Such a clever one to keep it.</i>

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.288
<i>How, you may ask, did he do it?</i>

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.241
<i>One word.</i>

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.560
<i>Poison.</i>

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.280
Get ready to drop.

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.686
<i>He stopped
every mutiny before it even started.</i>

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:10.881
Clear.

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.927
Clear. Command, we're inside.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.889
Heading toward target number one.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.811
Cell P45 lower level 2C.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.921
Gas.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.289
<i>There are
so many mysterious deaths</i>

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.725
<i>to adversaries.</i>

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.362
<i>Even to allies who were threats.</i>

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.325
<i>Snow would drink
from the same cup,</i>

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.606
<i>to deflect suspicion.</i>

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.684
<i>But antidotes don't always work,</i>

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.684
<i>which is why he wears
roses that reek of perfume.</i>

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.682
<i>Help cover the scent of blood from sores
in his mouth that will never heal.</i>

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.646
Gale.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.406
<i>But he can't
hide the scent of who he really is.</i>

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.249
<i>He kills without mercy.</i>

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.166
<i>He rules with deception and fear.</i>

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.287
<i>His weapon of choice
is the only thing suited to such a man.</i>

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.360
<i>Poison.</i>

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.721
<i>The perfect weapon for a snake.</i>

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.565
<i>What is this place?</i>

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.845
- Beetee?
- I'm losing them.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.400
Powering back up.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.324
Ma'am, the Capitol
air defense system

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:30.289
is rebooting. It's coming back online.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.089
Must be diverting power
from another source.

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.320
And filtering transmissions.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.805
Another 60 seconds and we'll be cut off.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.160
Madam President,
should we call back the hovercraft?

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.325
Broadcast me.

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.728
If Snow's watching this,
maybe he'll let the signal in,

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.086
if he sees me.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.684
Put me on the air
so he can see me.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.966
Yes. Yes.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.327
Put her on.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.687
Can we do this?
Can we still get in?

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.041
Yes.
For the moment.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.451
The line's open.
He will only see you.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.125
Okay, Katniss, go.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.641
President Snow?

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.449
President Snow.
It's Katniss.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.166
There's no guarantee
he's even watching.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.010
I know, but he might be.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.082
President Snow,
I need to speak with you.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.241
Are you there?

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.440
President Snow, it's Katniss.
Can you hear me?

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.285
I need to speak with you.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.442
President Snow, it's Katniss.

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.409
President Snow,

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.686
are you there?

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.410
Can you hear me?

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.121
President Snow...

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.851
<i>Miss Everdeen. What an honor.</i>

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.690
<i>I don't imagine you're calling
to thank me for the roses.</i>

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.808
I never asked for this.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.523
I never asked to be in the Games.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.404
Boggs?
Come in. Boggs?

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.847
I never asked
to be The Mockingjay.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.761
Just wanted to save my sister.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.046
And keep Peeta alive.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.642
Come in. Boggs?

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.728
Please, just let him go.

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.280
And I will stop being The Mockingjay.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.800
I will disappear.
You will never have
to see me ever again.

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.365
<i>Miss Everdeen.</i>

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.761
Boggs, come in.

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.291
You couldn't run from this...

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.407
Copy.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.881
...any <i>more than
you could have run from the Games.</i>

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.968
Command,
I need a situation report.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.520
<i>Boggs,
we're running out of time. Hurry.</i>

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.326
Let's move.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.566
<i>Please.</i>

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.250
You've won.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.125
<i>You've already beaten me.</i>

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.251
Release Peeta.
And take me instead.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:45.731
<i>We're long past the opportunity
for noble sacrifice.</i>

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.524
Then tell me what to do.

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.728
<i>I've always kept my promises,
haven't I?</i>

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.280
<i>You said
you didn't want a war.</i>

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.729
<i>And that's just what's happened.</i>

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.323
<i>I told you what a
fragile thing peace was.</i>

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.002
<i>And still, like a child,
you took pleasure in breaking it.</i>

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.289
<i>I know what you are.</i>

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:11.082
<i>I know you can't see
past your narrowest concerns.</i>

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.368
<i>But please, Miss Everdeen.</i>

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.046
<i>I doubt you know
what honesty is anymore.</i>

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.770
Command, we're at the first target.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.365
Preparing to extract Peeta.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.930
Will confirm when he's in hand.

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:27.121
Mockingjay One,
prepare hovercraft for evac.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:30.363
You asked me to convince you
that I was in love with Peeta.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.329
Haven't I at least done that?

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.765
Miss Everdeen,

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.644
<i>it's the things we love most</i>

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.204
<i>that destroy us.</i>

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.125
<i>I want you to remember
that I said that.</i>

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:56.849
<i>Don't you think I know
your friends are in the Tribute Center?</i>

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.846
<i>Cut them off.</i>

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.890
- What happened?
- Boggs, come in.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.007
What happened?

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.690
Boggs, come in.
Do you read me?

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.800
He knows that
they're in there.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:10.370
- It's a trap.
- Katniss, hold it.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.640
We have to get
a hold of them.

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.250
We have to tell them to get out.
He knows.

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.322
There's no signal.
We can't contact them.

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.201
No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.520
No, Haymitch.
They're in there.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.806
No, we don't know that.

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.680
Did I lose them both tonight?

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.683
- Did I lose them both tonight?
- Shh.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.924
Did I lose them?
I lost them both.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.689
No! No!

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.601
There's no news.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.285
I'm sorry.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.601
It's the worst torture in the world.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.889
Waiting, when you know
there's nothing you can do.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.727
Especially for people like us.

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.163
But whatever strength, courage,

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.325
madness,

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:17.882
keeps us going, you find it,
at times like these.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.724
You have it, soldier.

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.210
It's what's kept
you alive all this time.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.369
And it won't fail you now.

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.921
They're back.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.085
I don't want that.

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.761
Johanna.

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.406
Finnick!

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.331
Finnick!

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:16.085
Annie?
Annie!

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.367
You're safe.
You're safe.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.720
Gale!

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.610
Are you okay?

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.206
What?
What is it?

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.327
I don't get it.

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.205
Every gun was back online

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.601
and on us and
we flew right past them.

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.810
They let us go.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.321
He's in there.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.721
Gas we used on the guards

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.882
knocked him out, too,
but it's wearing off now.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.163
You should be there
when he wakes up.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:08.765
Thank you.

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.166
Thank you.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.691
Peeta.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.886
Peeta!

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.723
Peeta! Get off!
Get off of her!

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.202
Let go!

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.687
No, Katniss.
No, you're swollen. Don't touch.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.565
No, no, no.
Calm down.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.250
Calm down.
You're okay.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.611
Tell her she's awake.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.690
Don't try to talk.

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:06.285
Peeta's okay.
I promise.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.965
I just had to get him off you.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:18.042
It's called hijacking.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.284
We don't know how long
the Capitol's been doing this to Peeta.

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.770
It's fear conditioning.

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.808
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.602
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.689
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.602
And they torture him.

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:41.681
With shocks and beatings,
and strip down his identity.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.650
And then all of that
suffering and fear is redirected.

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.327
Associated with other
memories or a person.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.444
They can change
his memories of Katniss?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.320
To make her seem
life-threatening.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.082
They turned him
into a weapon, Katniss.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.491
To kill you.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:01.961
But you can reverse it?

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.080
The fear is the most
difficult thing to overcome.

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.885
We're hardwired to remember fear best.

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.644
It's new terrain.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.842
But we've put together a team.

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.842
I'm optimistic.

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:42.720
Good evening.

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.724
Yesterday, I authorized

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.963
a covert rescue mission
inside the Capitol.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.966
I am pleased to announce

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.090
that the Victors have been liberated!

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.651
<i>Let this day mark
an historic change.</i>

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.002
<i>With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,</i>

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.527
<i>we have sent a clear
message to the Capitol.</i>

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.401
That we will never
again endure injustice.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.571
Today,

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:28.008
a day on which we reunited family,

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.926
friends, and loved ones.

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:35.526
<i>Let all of Panem come together.</i>

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:40.480
<i>Not to battle
for the amusement of the Capitol.</i>

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.564
<i>But to join hands in this fight.</i>

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.126
Let today be
the day we promise

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:56.921
never to give up,
never to give in

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.004
until we have
made a new Panem,

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.846
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.568
And where the districts are free

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.961
to share the fruits of their labors

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.361
and not fight one another for scraps!

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.529
This new Panem is on the horizon.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.128
But we must take
it for ourselves.

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.484
<i>The road there
leads through the sharp mountains</i>

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.683
<i>and deep ravines of District 2.</i>

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.842
<i>There in the heart</i>

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.571
<i>of Panem's steepest
mountain range lies</i>

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:45.849
the Capitol's principal military facility.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.241
<i>We can conquer this stronghold</i>

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:52.724
because we are one people,

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.607
one army, one voice.

01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.248
<i>Because today is our new beginning.</i>

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.525
Today we have freed the Victors.

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:09.169
Tomorrow, Panem!

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.604
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!
