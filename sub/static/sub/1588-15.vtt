GINGER: Did you see the paper?

01:56.416 --> 01:58.018
Three break-in's this week!

01:58.085 --> 01:59.720
We need a home
security system.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.023
RICK: We got one.

02:03.090 --> 02:06.226
No one's breaking-in with
the Spikenator in charge.

Right, boy?

02:07.327 --> 02:11.332

02:11.399 --> 02:14.868
'Cause that cat

02:14.935 --> 02:17.237
Maybe we should stay
home tonight.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.573
Come on!

02:18.640 --> 02:23.243
Spike's not letting
anyone break-in,

03:04.317 --> 03:05.552
Uh... No.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.720

03:06.787 --> 03:08.356
Ain't no one
protecting nothin'

03:08.422 --> 03:13.422

to knock someone's light out!

03:16.530 --> 03:19.567
Thanks for volunteering.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.737
In self-defense you wanna
deliver the first punch.

03:23.804 --> 03:28.075
Carpe diem!

03:28.142 --> 03:31.678
Didn't see that coming, huh?

03:31.745 --> 03:35.345
Show me what you learnt.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.867
(CRASHING)

03:59.640 --> 04:00.240
Now?

04:10.084 --> 04:13.154
Pea shooters,
the first line of security.

04:13.220 --> 04:18.170

to do the job!

04:18.725 --> 04:20.794

04:23.931 --> 04:25.199
On the count to three,

04:25.266 --> 04:29.766
you run, we'll try to hit you.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.404
One.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.329
You didn't run.

04:45.853 --> 04:50.853
A safe house is
a booby trapped house.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.533
A volunteer, please.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.840
Stand there.

05:30.030 --> 05:34.034
For reporting funny business.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.437
And no funny business
from youse two either!

05:37.504 --> 05:38.554
Got it?

05:54.021 --> 05:58.259

10:32.967 --> 10:37.967
Did you do this
to the big bad burglar,
Spikenator?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.575
So, Ginger,

10:41.642 --> 10:44.077

home security system, now?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.846
