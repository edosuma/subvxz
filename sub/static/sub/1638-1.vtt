01:16.996 --> 01:19.633
It's a fucking hotbox.

01:19.733 --> 01:23.070
Man, the fucking dirt here
tastes like dog shit.

01:23.170 --> 01:27.260
- Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you?
- Shut the fuck up.

02:13.370 --> 02:18.376
I got a military-age male that's on
a cell phone watching the convoy, over.

02:18.526 --> 02:23.164
<i>If you think he's reporting troop movement,
you have a green light. Your call. Over.</i>

02:23.264 --> 02:26.518
Maybe he's just calling his old lady.

02:33.396 --> 02:35.657
He stepped off.

02:43.915 --> 02:48.970
Hold on. I got a woman and a kid,
200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

02:53.928 --> 02:56.398
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

03:06.006 --> 03:06.910
Yeah, she's got a grenade.

03:07.010 --> 03:09.280
She's got an RKG Russian grenade
she just handed to the kid.

03:10.144 --> 03:12.231
<i>You say a woman and a kid?</i>

03:12.481 --> 03:16.953
- You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
- <i>Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.</i>

03:17.053 --> 03:20.725
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

03:38.408 --> 03:40.324
You got him.

03:56.447 --> 03:58.515
Hey, get back here!

04:00.669 --> 04:04.118
- You don't ever leave your rifle in the dirt.
- Yes, sir.

04:08.837 --> 04:13.147
That was a hell of a shot, son.
You got a gift.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.196
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.837
Here in the book of acts,

04:19.937 --> 04:23.779
several times, Paul stands in judgment

04:23.879 --> 04:26.004
for what he believes.

04:26.354 --> 04:28.175
And at times, we all have to do that.

04:28.325 --> 04:30.691
I mean, we don't see with his eyes,

04:30.791 --> 04:34.437
so we don't know the glory of his plan.

04:34.598 --> 04:39.421
Our lives unfold before us
like puzzling reflections in a mirror.

04:39.969 --> 04:42.687
- What are you doing?
- And on the day we rise...

04:43.688 --> 04:48.095
we will see with clarity and understand
the mystery of his ways.

04:48.945 --> 04:50.296
Let us pray.

04:51.258 --> 04:54.335
There are three types of people
in this world...

04:54.817 --> 04:58.427
sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.

04:58.622 --> 05:03.764
Now, some people prefer to believe
that evil doesn't exist in the world.

05:03.864 --> 05:07.697
And if it ever darkened their doorstep,
they wouldn't know how to protect themselves.

05:07.797 --> 05:10.371
Those are the sheep.

05:10.471 --> 05:12.234
And then you got predators.

05:12.334 --> 05:16.856
They use violence to prey on the weak.
They're the wolves.

05:18.091 --> 05:22.178
And then there are those who've been
blessed with the gift of aggression

05:22.278 --> 05:25.165
and the overpowering need
to protect the flock.

05:27.015 --> 05:31.038
These men are the rare breed
that live to confront the wolf.

05:32.588 --> 05:34.809
They are the sheepdog.

05:36.660 --> 05:40.113
Now, we're not raising
any sheep in this family.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.049
And I will whup your ass
if you turn into a wolf.

05:43.149 --> 05:44.949
Wayne.

05:49.007 --> 05:51.356
But we protect our own.

05:52.275 --> 05:54.561
Now, if someone tries to fight you

05:54.811 --> 05:58.817
or tries to bully your little brother,
you have my permission to finish it.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.436
The guy was picking on Jeff.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.942
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir. Yes, he was.

06:07.692 --> 06:09.514
Did you finish it?

06:12.929 --> 06:15.430
Well, then you know who you are.

06:18.936 --> 06:21.128
You know your purpose.

06:23.240 --> 06:27.094
<i>Chris Kyle is on the horse
Big Mistress here this evening.</i>

06:28.546 --> 06:30.031
You're all right.

06:31.048 --> 06:33.101
Now, get ready.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.029
That's good.

06:37.288 --> 06:41.608
<i>So, tonight, he needs to beat
the leading score of 86.</i>

07:09.887 --> 07:12.963
Hey, Jeff. Looks like
your brother did it again.

07:13.063 --> 07:13.943
<i>...Chris Kyle.</i>

07:14.093 --> 07:18.596
Man, wasn't nobody there.
You come out with a belt buckle.

07:18.696 --> 07:21.483
- What are you supposed to do with it?
- Supposed to get laid with it.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.569
I'm gonna wear it
and see if it puts Sarah in the mood.

07:23.669 --> 07:25.404
Shit, a strong wind'll
put Sarah in the mood.

07:25.504 --> 07:26.838
Oh, is that what they say?

07:26.938 --> 07:28.106
Man, you know what they
called her in high school.

07:28.206 --> 07:30.175
- All right. Don't say it.
- Sarah sucks-a-lotta...

07:30.275 --> 07:32.278
- What'd I say?
- Shit, Chris.

07:32.378 --> 07:33.631
Goddamn it.

07:41.186 --> 07:44.163
That was bucking money, those two girls.
And that's why... no.

07:44.263 --> 07:47.927
He kept looking... he had his eyes on her,
and that's why, the last time...

07:48.027 --> 07:50.029
- Wait till you see what this does.
- Yeah.

07:50.129 --> 07:51.897
Let's see him go!

07:51.997 --> 07:55.001
Hey, baby. Who wants to fuck
a rodeo star? What the fuck?

07:55.101 --> 07:57.068
You said you wasn't coming home
until tomorrow.

07:57.168 --> 07:58.436
- I said what?
- No, I just didn't...

07:58.536 --> 08:00.662
Chris, just leave him alone, all right?
He didn't do anything!

08:00.762 --> 08:04.142
- I didn't know shit, man. Help!
- Chris, leave him alone!

08:04.242 --> 08:08.681
Fucking Chris, leave him alone!
Goddamn it! What is wrong with you?

08:08.781 --> 08:11.685
- He didn't know, all right?
- Oh, he didn't know? What didn't you know?

08:11.785 --> 08:13.966
- Just give me my hat.
- Get his hat, baby.

08:14.066 --> 08:16.356
He didn't know what?
Whose rifles did you think those were?

08:16.456 --> 08:19.140
Those clothes, them men's clothes weren't hers?
Is that what you didn't know?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.629
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You don't have to fucking punch everyone!

08:22.729 --> 08:26.014
Put that fucking hat on
and get the fuck out.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.419
What the fuck is wrong with you?

08:32.078 --> 08:32.938
Get out.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.607
You know what?
I don't know what you expect from me.

08:35.707 --> 08:39.578
You drag me out here and then you run off
with your brother every damn weekend.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.948
Why do you think I did this?

08:42.048 --> 08:45.599
I do this to get attention!
Don't you get that?

08:48.487 --> 08:50.072
Get your stuff and get out.

08:51.438 --> 08:54.377
Fine. Fine. You know what?
Fuck you. Fine.

08:55.027 --> 08:57.663
You think you're a cowboy
'cause you rodeo.

08:57.763 --> 09:00.783
You're not a cowboy.
You're just a lousy ranch hand.

09:00.933 --> 09:03.353
And you're a shitty fucking lay.

09:09.309 --> 09:11.193
Don't say it.

09:11.543 --> 09:13.129
When's the wedding?

09:16.750 --> 09:19.306
I understand what you're saying, but...

09:19.406 --> 09:22.338
you know, we get to travel
over the whole state.

09:22.588 --> 09:25.310
Different city every weekend.

09:26.721 --> 09:28.473
Broncs and steers.

09:28.573 --> 09:31.799
- I don't know. Maybe she's right, though.
- She's right?

09:32.149 --> 09:37.044
Right about what, Chris?
She's not right, man. We're cowboys.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.140
- We're living the dream.
- <i>This is a special report.</i>

09:39.240 --> 09:42.317
<i>Those explosions set to go off
at the U.S. embassies</i>

09:42.417 --> 09:45.244
<i>in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania,
and Nairobi, Kenya,</i>

09:45.344 --> 09:48.648
<i>were clearly a part of someone's war
against the United States.</i>

09:48.748 --> 09:53.454
<i>More than 80 dead, more than 1,700 injured
in two bomb blasts today...</i>

09:53.554 --> 09:56.090
Hey, Jeff. Jeff. Hey.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.348
- <i>...250 miles apart.</i>
- Look at this.

09:58.448 --> 10:01.845
<i>It is still unclear at this hour
who our enemy is.</i>

10:02.045 --> 10:03.563
<i>Although the embassies
were obviously the targets...</i>

10:03.663 --> 10:07.033
- Look what they did to us.
- <i>...and injured are not Americans.</i>

10:07.133 --> 10:13.498
<i>Still, eight Americans, including one child,
are dead, and five are still missing.</i>

10:17.543 --> 10:19.579
- So, you're from Texas.
- Yes, sir.

10:19.679 --> 10:22.115
- You're a patriot.
- Yes, sir.

10:22.215 --> 10:25.119
- And you're pissed off.
- I'm looking to be of service.

10:25.219 --> 10:27.138
- You like to fight?
- Yes, sir.

10:27.388 --> 10:31.645
You like to fight. Okay. Well...
Why don't you meet the warrior elite?

10:32.895 --> 10:35.813
- SEALs.
- Yep. Sea, air, and land.

10:35.963 --> 10:37.665
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir.

10:37.765 --> 10:41.494
No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a heart.
Most men, they wash out, they quit.

10:41.594 --> 10:44.857
But I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.

10:46.407 --> 10:49.944
- <i>This is where the fun stops, guys!</i>
- Take it, girls! Take it!

10:50.044 --> 10:54.032
That's it, girls. Take it. Take it.
Only hurts the first time.

10:54.182 --> 10:57.417
- What we got here? You a quitter, boy?
- Hooyah, no, instructor Rolle.

10:57.517 --> 11:00.155
Bullshit! Yo ass is fleet meat
if I ever did see it!

11:00.255 --> 11:03.792
Don't turn away from me, son.
You look at me and you take this shit.

11:03.892 --> 11:06.460
- Hooyah, sir!
- Damn, you old as fuck!

11:06.560 --> 11:08.929
You join the Navy 'cause you had
such a good goddamn time on Noah's ark?

11:09.029 --> 11:11.176
- How old are you, boy?
- Hooyah, 30!

11:11.276 --> 11:14.785
30? Your fart dust
could have fathered half these boys.

11:15.035 --> 11:17.206
We gonna weed through the quitters.

11:17.306 --> 11:20.142
Yeah, we gonna find us
a goddamn warrior or two today.

11:20.242 --> 11:22.004
Dauber, are you sure
you're from Connecticut?

11:22.104 --> 11:24.678
I ain't never met no hick
from Hartford before.

11:24.778 --> 11:28.885
Hooyah, instructor Friday! Country's
countrywide. I came here to kill terrorists.

11:28.985 --> 11:32.286
Who the fuck told your ass to giggle?

11:32.386 --> 11:34.306
Hooyah, no one, instructor Rolle!

11:34.406 --> 11:37.658
- Did I ask you to open up your mouth?
- Hooyah, no, instructor Rolle.

11:37.758 --> 11:40.695
Look at your fat, pasty, giggly ass.

11:40.795 --> 11:45.001
Damn, son! You a big Dr. pepper,
cheeto-eating motherfucker.

11:45.101 --> 11:47.704
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

11:47.804 --> 11:52.524
Biggles. That's your name from now on,
sunshine. And that's your ticket home.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.119
"D"! What are you still doing in my line,
trying to make this team?

11:55.219 --> 11:59.195
- Everybody knows black guys don't swim.
- It's all right, sir. I'm not black.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.132
- No?
- No. I'm the new black.

12:01.232 --> 12:04.686
We run slow, we jump low,
we swim good, and we shop at gap.

12:04.786 --> 12:08.874
And I make the white folk proud when
I hose down their ladies. I dick 'em down!

12:09.505 --> 12:11.660
Hooyah!

12:12.327 --> 12:15.614
There it is! That is a quitter.

12:16.364 --> 12:18.584
You say goodbye, I say good riddance.

12:18.734 --> 12:21.820
He quits on you here,
he's gonna quit in the field of battle.

12:22.170 --> 12:26.224
When shit gets hairy, he won't step up.
Your ass gets shot, he won't pull you out.

12:26.574 --> 12:28.344
I'm looking for warriors!

12:28.444 --> 12:30.763
- Seven!
- Keep counting!

12:31.213 --> 12:33.504
- Eight! Nine!
- I can't hear you!

12:33.604 --> 12:37.320
You want me to call your mama, old man?
Maybe she could come and take your place.

12:37.420 --> 12:42.790
This is foreplay! I'm about to turn on
some Marvin Gaye and get in that ass!

12:42.890 --> 12:44.426
That's what I'm talking about!

12:44.526 --> 12:47.579
Squirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel,
where the fuck are your nuts?

12:47.729 --> 12:50.967
Oh, they're gone for good, sir.
They crawled back up inside.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.802
But they are warm.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.936
Big talk from a little man!

12:55.036 --> 12:59.003
Now you. How about you, old man?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.228
How you feeling?

13:01.378 --> 13:04.430
Hooyah, dangerous. Feeling dangerous.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.702
Hooyah! Kyle's feeling dangerous.

13:08.052 --> 13:09.836
<i>Move!</i>

13:14.558 --> 13:16.897
<i>Take seats!</i>

13:21.265 --> 13:25.143
Damn! 56 degrees, so fresh, so clean.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.955
Only a few more hours,
and you're Navy SEALs!

13:41.467 --> 13:43.186
- I'm the only one who's hit one, so...
- Yeah.

13:43.286 --> 13:44.971
Boom!

13:45.961 --> 13:47.524
- Oh, yeah.
- Chris, your turn, man.

13:47.624 --> 13:49.526
- No, you got one more.
- I got one more? All right.

13:49.626 --> 13:51.406
All right. One more.
Here we go. Here we go.

13:53.897 --> 13:56.624
Hey, we want a smaller target,
we'll use your arm, man.

13:59.168 --> 14:02.155
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:02.405 --> 14:04.307
How you doing?

14:04.407 --> 14:05.995
Good. Thank you.

14:08.245 --> 14:10.507
Can I... get you a drink?

14:10.757 --> 14:14.419
Will a drink make you
six inches taller and charming?

14:14.519 --> 14:16.913
- Will it make you not married?
- I'm not...

14:17.013 --> 14:20.190
Yeah. I just watched you
take your ring off, okay?

14:20.290 --> 14:23.412
Don't be a scumbag. Go home.

14:25.362 --> 14:27.583
Oh, my God.

14:29.733 --> 14:33.755
- It may have been the leather pants.
- Oh, yeah?

14:34.505 --> 14:37.508
What kind of pants does a girl
have to wear to be left alone?

14:37.608 --> 14:40.043
Well, maybe corduroy.

14:40.143 --> 14:42.112
I mean, is that how it is with you guys?

14:42.212 --> 14:45.083
You're, like, suddenly single
after three beers?

14:45.183 --> 14:47.802
Oh, no. After three beers,
all I know is to get a fourth.

14:48.352 --> 14:51.988
Oh, that's great. That's great.
Real redneck.

14:52.088 --> 14:54.506
Oh, I'm not a redneck. I'm from Texas.

14:54.758 --> 14:56.293
What's the difference?

14:56.393 --> 14:59.180
Well, we ride horses
and they ride their cousins.

15:00.078 --> 15:02.099
What do you do for work?
You're obviously military.

15:02.199 --> 15:04.735
I polish dolphins. They're in captivity.

15:04.835 --> 15:06.703
What I do is just sort of
scrape off the crustaceans.

15:06.803 --> 15:11.081
- Do I look stupid to you?
- No. Honestly, you look a little sad.

15:15.111 --> 15:19.165
- Am I... tall enough to buy you a drink?
- Not until you tell me what you do.

15:19.315 --> 15:21.166
Okay. How about this? Hey, Greg?

15:21.266 --> 15:23.390
Get two shots.
How 'bout we do a shot for a question?

15:23.490 --> 15:26.808
Every time you ask me a question and I answer,
you got to do a shot. Same, vice versa.

15:26.908 --> 15:28.143
Game on.

15:28.243 --> 15:31.729
You can leave the bottle, too.
Okay, shoot.

15:31.829 --> 15:35.400
All right. You're obviously military.
What branch?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.537
I just finished BUD/S,
heading to sniper school.

15:38.637 --> 15:42.258
- Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:43.708 --> 15:47.178
- That's two questions.
- Shit.

15:47.278 --> 15:49.269
Really?

15:51.815 --> 15:54.295
Oh, I didn't really mean
you had to do that.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.621
Okay. Shit.

15:56.721 --> 15:59.574
I know all about you guys.
My sister was engaged to a SEAL.

16:00.024 --> 16:02.195
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.

16:02.745 --> 16:05.262
Hold on. How you know all about us?
What do you mean?

16:05.362 --> 16:09.019
What I mean is, you're a bunch of arrogant,
self-centered pricks who think you can lie

16:09.119 --> 16:13.255
and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want.
I'd never date a SEAL.

16:14.595 --> 16:17.758
Wait. Why would you say I'm self-centered?
I'd lay down my life for my country.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.245
Why?

16:19.345 --> 16:22.680
'Cause it's the greatest country on earth,
and I'd do everything I can to protect it.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.667
Look, I'm sorry what happened
to your sister, but that's not me.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.556
- It's nice to meet you.
- Where are you going?

16:30.656 --> 16:33.660
Well, I was just gonna go home because
you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so...

16:35.093 --> 16:37.847
I said I'd never marry one.

16:38.618 --> 16:42.602
Oh, okay. Well, then maybe, hello.
Nice to meet you. What's your name?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.520
- Taya.
- Taya.

16:44.970 --> 16:48.526
Chris. I'm Chris Kyle.
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

16:49.841 --> 16:54.096
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to think
you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris?

16:54.246 --> 16:58.868
Well, our BUD/S officer commander
said that it's three...

16:59.449 --> 17:03.948
Okay. He said there's three things we got to
worry about: Ego, booze, and women.

17:04.048 --> 17:08.125
Well, sounds like you're under attack.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.431
You're pretty.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.653
You're so cute.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.305
I got you.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.688
I'm not going home with you,
so don't even think about it.

17:45.897 --> 17:48.419
Feel breath filling
every cell in your body.

17:51.106 --> 17:52.356
This is our ritual.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.393
We master our breath,
we master our mind.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.213
Pulling the trigger
will become an unconscious effort.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.117
You will be aware of it,
but not directing it.

18:03.217 --> 18:06.953
And as you exhale,
find your natural respiratory pause

18:07.053 --> 18:09.345
and the space between heartbeats.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.476
<i>Hey. This is Taya. I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message. I'll call you back.</i>

18:29.576 --> 18:33.013
<i>Hey, it's me again.
The guy whose shoes you puked on.</i>

18:33.113 --> 18:35.850
<i>So... yeah, I was thinking
maybe you didn't get that last message,</i>

18:35.950 --> 18:39.803
<i>the last message I left, or...
the one before that. So I figured that...</i>

18:39.907 --> 18:44.375
- You figured what?
- <i>Hey. How are you? How've you been?</i>

18:44.825 --> 18:45.993
Good.

18:46.093 --> 18:50.030
<i>Good. Wow. What are you up to?</i>

18:50.130 --> 18:52.950
Not a lot. You?

18:53.143 --> 18:56.176
<i>No, just... excited to talk to you.</i>

19:04.410 --> 19:05.775
Aim small, miss small.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.399
If you aim for a shirt button,
you might miss by 2 inches.

19:08.849 --> 19:12.185
If you aim for his shirt,
you might miss by 2 feet.

19:18.726 --> 19:21.679
- You better close those groupings, Kyle.
- Yes, sir.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.214
God.

19:26.100 --> 19:29.204
- Not bad. What do we get for that?
- Top shelf.

19:29.304 --> 19:31.340
- I like that one. Brown one.
- Sure. Here you go.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.476
- Great. Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
- Oh, look! Thank you.

19:34.576 --> 19:38.011
- Hello.
- Oh, good. That looks good on you.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.942
So, did you always want to be a soldier?

19:41.392 --> 19:43.459
No. I wanted to be a cowboy, but...

19:43.559 --> 19:46.221
I don't know. I did that.
Thought I was meant for something more.

19:46.321 --> 19:48.922
So you started rescuing girls from bars?

19:49.022 --> 19:51.908
I think I rescued that bar from you.

19:53.193 --> 19:57.381
- You like country music?
- Only when I'm depressed.

19:59.233 --> 20:02.253
- How about kids? You want kids?
- Yeah, someday.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.922
My mom says I have a nose
for picking the wrong men.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.710
Well, that's a shitty thing
to say to a girl.

20:09.810 --> 20:11.129
Well, I've proven her right.

20:12.049 --> 20:14.781
Them wrong picks put you here,

20:14.881 --> 20:18.590
made you who you are.
I like who you are.

20:20.514 --> 20:23.875
You ever think about what happens when
there's a real person on the end of that gun?

20:24.825 --> 20:27.774
I don't know. I just hope I can do my job
when that day comes.

20:40.575 --> 20:44.280
Are we looking at the same target?
You're spitting dust.

20:44.380 --> 20:47.968
And don't worry. We can always use corpsmen
for the guys who can't shoot.

20:49.518 --> 20:51.794
Oh, fuck.

21:16.044 --> 21:19.566
- You're trembling.
- I know it.

21:20.016 --> 21:22.434
- We don't have to do this if you don't...
- No, I want to. I do.

21:22.684 --> 21:25.120
- Yeah?
- You just feel real and it scares me.

21:36.498 --> 21:38.675
You got your off-eye shut?

21:38.775 --> 21:41.404
Well, if I close my off-eye,
then I can't see what's out there.

21:41.504 --> 21:45.408
- There's nothing out there but the target.
- Negative. Sir, there is something out there.

21:45.508 --> 21:46.993
Punch it.

21:48.069 --> 21:51.601
Will push-ups help?
Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe.

21:58.589 --> 22:00.907
I'm better when it's breathing.

22:03.389 --> 22:05.928
- <i>...what appears to be another...</i>
- Oh, my God. Chris!

22:06.028 --> 22:08.413
- What's wrong?
- No!

22:08.663 --> 22:12.871
<i>Here's the tape. You see the first plane
coming in from what looks like the east side.</i>

22:12.971 --> 22:15.414
<i>And it goes into the building
with the flames</i>

22:15.514 --> 22:18.975
<i>and the smoke billowing out
the other side of the tower.</i>

22:19.075 --> 22:23.246
<i>It's hard for me to tell exactly which is
the north side and which is the south side.</i>

22:23.346 --> 22:25.682
<i>But it appears it's coming out
of the north side there.</i>

22:25.782 --> 22:28.837
<i>And then, moments ago,
these incredible images.</i>

22:28.937 --> 22:33.173
<i>I believe that's the first one.
That's the south tower collapsing.</i>

22:33.723 --> 22:37.243
<i>It almost looks like one of those implosions
of buildings that you see,</i>

22:37.343 --> 22:42.787
<i>except there is nothing controlled
about this. This is devastation.</i>

22:52.376 --> 22:53.843
You don't even know me.

22:53.943 --> 22:57.255
I know enough.
You are a package deal, babe.

23:02.351 --> 23:05.908
- What are you so afraid of?
- Nothing.

23:07.758 --> 23:11.312
Everything. I don't know.
What if it doesn't work out?

23:12.762 --> 23:16.133
We're gonna get married
and then we're gonna start a family.

23:16.233 --> 23:19.547
You got it all planned out, don't you?

23:19.797 --> 23:21.690
I'm done.

23:22.105 --> 23:23.847
I love you.

23:25.811 --> 23:28.480
Well, you're gonna need a ring
if you want to talk all tough like that.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.185
Okay.

23:39.722 --> 23:43.276
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle!</i>

23:53.263 --> 23:55.466
What the hell is on your neck?

23:55.566 --> 23:57.658
Your neck. You've got, like,
green paint all over you.

23:57.908 --> 24:00.267
Would you believe me, babe,
if I told you I had an I.V.

24:00.367 --> 24:02.614
and I was all green about two hours ago?

24:02.714 --> 24:04.616
What are you... what?

24:04.716 --> 24:07.419
- It's a package deal, babe.
- Oh, my God.

24:07.519 --> 24:09.537
Come here, you.

24:11.255 --> 24:12.873
Cheers to that.

24:13.123 --> 24:15.032
What's the word, chief?

24:15.482 --> 24:18.328
Just got the call, boys. It's on!

24:18.428 --> 24:20.510
Hooyah!

24:20.660 --> 24:22.477
Shots!

24:23.738 --> 24:25.317
Yes!

24:25.417 --> 24:27.248
Five shots.

24:29.808 --> 24:31.444
Yeah!

24:34.888 --> 24:36.911
- It's only gonna be six weeks, baby.
- I'm so afraid, baby.

24:37.011 --> 24:39.317
That's what they say.
You got nothing to be afraid of.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.215
- What are you...
- It's all part of the plan.

24:42.588 --> 24:45.702
Your heart is beating out of your chest.

24:46.524 --> 24:49.777
That's just 'cause I'm not the only one
that's going to war. That's all.

24:51.863 --> 24:52.749
Cheers!

25:05.509 --> 25:09.313
Welcome to Fallujah.
The new wild west of the old Middle East.

25:09.413 --> 25:12.950
AQI put a price on your heads,
and now extremists from around the globe

25:13.050 --> 25:16.695
are flooding the borders
to collect on it. You snipers...

25:17.424 --> 25:21.027
you're gonna be paired with a marine to watch
your back and inserted along the main road

25:21.127 --> 25:24.296
to do overwatch for 1st marines
going door to door.

25:24.396 --> 25:27.333
Your job is to protect
those marines at all costs.

25:27.433 --> 25:29.601
This city has been evacuated.

25:29.701 --> 25:34.056
Any military-age male who is still here...
is here to kill you.

25:34.806 --> 25:38.577
Let's bring these boys in safe
and get our asses back home.

25:55.927 --> 25:57.747
Out, out, out!

25:59.697 --> 26:02.250
I'd keep that head down, Tex.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.553
Muj got snipers, too, you know.

26:05.203 --> 26:08.192
A sniper won't aim for your head.

26:10.203 --> 26:15.043
Man, they got this one sniper that's been
hitting head shots from 500 yards out.

26:18.785 --> 26:21.202
They call him Mustafa.

26:22.152 --> 26:24.290
He's in the Olympics.

26:24.390 --> 26:26.449
They got sniping in the Olympics now?

26:40.774 --> 26:45.772
Hold on. I got a woman and a kid,
200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

26:50.816 --> 26:53.153
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

27:02.995 --> 27:06.215
She's got a grenade. She's got an RKG
Russian grenade she just handed to the kid.

27:06.565 --> 27:08.040
<i>You say a woman and a kid?</i>

27:09.268 --> 27:13.556
- You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
<i>- Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.</i>

27:13.706 --> 27:17.696
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.840
Fuck, that was gnarly.

28:00.687 --> 28:02.840
Fucking evil bitch.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.810
Get up. Keep moving.

28:05.910 --> 28:09.915
- <i>Nice shooting, Tex. Hell of a call.</i>
- <i>Roger that. Good looking out, Navy.</i>

28:10.065 --> 28:13.361
- Fuck, did you hear that, man?
- Get the fuck off me.

28:39.609 --> 28:40.728
Where is everybody?

28:40.828 --> 28:44.565
We're just checking our dicks here, man.
We're training those fucking Hajji soldiers.

28:44.665 --> 28:45.882
Yeah, why aren't you out there?

28:47.069 --> 28:51.238
- Well, I have the shits.
- What, reading a comic book?

28:51.338 --> 28:54.529
It's a fucking graphic novel, man.
There's a big difference.

28:57.179 --> 28:58.814
I heard you were
on fucking fire out there.

28:58.914 --> 29:03.093
Marc Lee came in, said you popped
your cherry. Is that right?

29:03.352 --> 29:06.923
There was a kid who...
barely had any hair on his balls.

29:07.023 --> 29:09.375
Mother gives him a grenade,

29:09.525 --> 29:11.993
sends him out there to kill marines.

29:17.498 --> 29:20.167
Dude, that's evil
like I never seen before.

29:20.267 --> 29:22.441
Yeah. But, hey, man,

29:22.541 --> 29:25.575
you know that kid could have taken out
like 10 fucking marines, right?

29:25.675 --> 29:26.743
Yeah, but I killed him.

29:26.843 --> 29:29.877
You did your job.
That's the end of the story.

29:29.977 --> 29:33.630
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned
that first one to go down.

29:36.338 --> 29:40.212
Riley, it's okay.
Don't have the actuals.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.218
Fuck, man! What the hell?

29:52.968 --> 29:56.991
That was your overwatch, Einstein.
You can thank him later.

30:00.241 --> 30:02.094
Let's move!

30:02.544 --> 30:04.430
Keep going.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.439
Hurry up.

30:19.209 --> 30:21.554
Disperse!

30:30.306 --> 30:31.809
Cease fire! Cease fire!

32:24.856 --> 32:27.395
Eyes on the rooftop!
Keep your eyes up there!

32:46.544 --> 32:50.415
Man down! Man down!
We need a corpsman over here now!

32:50.515 --> 32:53.895
<i>Enemy sniper located.
Approximate grid, Quebec-Romeo,</i>

32:53.995 --> 32:57.239
<i>1-5-5-6-0-4.</i>

33:04.394 --> 33:07.427
- Smells like piss in here.
- Yeah, well...

33:07.527 --> 33:10.811
You covered our asses out there, man.
Some ballsy shots.

33:10.911 --> 33:13.955
- Fuck. They were clean, right?
- Hell yeah, they were.

33:14.105 --> 33:16.473
That fucking sniper
went right up our ass!

33:16.573 --> 33:19.090
Yeah, I already chewed out security detail.
It ain't gonna happen again.

33:19.190 --> 33:20.711
It better not happen again.

33:20.811 --> 33:22.980
- There's a hot spot 400 meters out.
- All right.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.683
I'm gonna go write up
some shooter statements.

33:24.783 --> 33:28.119
- How many'd you get?
- I got six... oh. No, that's not true.

33:28.219 --> 33:31.700
I got eight, but they dragged two off.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.461
- You got six?
- Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

33:34.561 --> 33:36.827
Nothing. You just got more
than the rest of the snipers combined.

33:36.927 --> 33:40.472
- Yeah, but they got one of us.
- You can't shoot what you can't see.

33:42.534 --> 33:44.853
His wife said he was carrying a Koran.

33:44.953 --> 33:49.140
Look, I don't know what a Koran looks like,
but I can tell you what he was carrying.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.643
It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s,

33:51.743 --> 33:54.903
and it looked just like an AK-47.
So you tell me what he was carrying.

34:06.876 --> 34:08.159
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

34:08.260 --> 34:11.161
Ladies and genitals, listen up!
We have a legend in our midst!

34:11.262 --> 34:13.998
Round of applause for The Legend!

34:14.098 --> 34:17.001
There we go. We're so proud of you
back home on the range, boy.

34:17.101 --> 34:20.005
Now, it's been... it's been said
that The Legend here

34:20.105 --> 34:22.907
can kill 100 men with one blow.

34:23.007 --> 34:25.090
Or, no, it was... what was...
nah, it was... fuck. What was it?

34:25.190 --> 34:30.431
It was one... one blow from a single man.
He blew 100... men.

34:30.581 --> 34:34.303
And he's single. And...
Goddamn it! Shit!

34:34.853 --> 34:35.938
Oh, shit!

34:36.088 --> 34:37.722
- Damn, man.
- Oh, fuck.

34:37.822 --> 34:40.192
You want a food fight? Come on.

34:40.292 --> 34:44.252
- Shit.
- Only way to shut you up.

34:45.964 --> 34:48.266
<i>Have you killed anyone yet?</i>

34:48.366 --> 34:52.603
That is not the way the call home
is supposed to go, babe.

34:52.704 --> 34:57.625
Don't be weird with me. Seriously.
I want you to tell me everything.

34:58.675 --> 35:01.857
Well, there's certain things
you just can't say over the phone.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.749
Okay, you knocked me up, right?

35:03.849 --> 35:06.819
And I'm sitting here by myself
literally assembling baby cribs,

35:06.919 --> 35:10.673
and you can't talk to me?
That's your big plan?

35:12.842 --> 35:15.311
<i>You guys almost done over there yet?</i>

35:15.861 --> 35:19.349
I can't stop thinking about that little
pink number you wore on our honeymoon.

35:21.066 --> 35:23.553
Yeah, it's called a nightgown.

35:23.993 --> 35:25.561
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:26.206 --> 35:28.221
And three days...

35:28.321 --> 35:31.244
<i>three days is not a honeymoon.</i>

35:31.344 --> 35:34.330
Well, it was a good three days.

35:38.383 --> 35:40.753
I miss you real bad.

35:40.853 --> 35:42.639
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

35:42.789 --> 35:46.292
- Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

35:46.392 --> 35:49.305
<i>Hold on. Hold on a second.
Let me just...</i>

35:51.564 --> 35:54.901
I got... a phone in one hand
and a gun in the other,

35:55.001 --> 35:56.465
so I don't know what I'm gonna do.

35:56.565 --> 35:59.401
Well, you're gonna have to decide
what's more important, baby.

36:01.008 --> 36:03.476
Oh, you're a horny preggers.

36:03.576 --> 36:06.879
<i>Fat and horny. It's fucking disgusting.</i>

36:06.979 --> 36:09.666
If you were 300 pounds,
I'd still do you.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.832
So romantic.

36:13.018 --> 36:17.474
- <i>How's my boy?</i>
- Nobody said it's a boy.

36:17.574 --> 36:20.461
I can't wait to see the way
you're gonna be with him.

36:20.561 --> 36:22.114
<i>How do you know?</i>

36:23.664 --> 36:25.899
I just know.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.618
I can sense it.

36:27.968 --> 36:32.173
- I hope you're right.
- <i>Baby, I am right.</i>

36:34.350 --> 36:38.146
- Hey, did your dad get ahold of you?
- <i>I haven't checked my e-mails.</i>

36:38.246 --> 36:42.209
Shit! Okay, you need to hang up
and call him, all right?

36:42.309 --> 36:45.268
- <i>Why? What's wrong?</i>
- Fuck. I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking.

36:45.368 --> 36:48.902
Taya, what's wrong? What happened?

36:49.956 --> 36:51.709
Your little brother deployed.

36:52.259 --> 36:53.760
What do you mean?
What happened to jump school?

36:53.860 --> 36:56.897
No, he didn't get in. You just hang up
and call your dad, okay?

36:56.997 --> 37:00.351
Wait. What do you mean?
Deployed where? Where is he?

37:00.701 --> 37:02.653
<i>Over there.</i>

37:03.536 --> 37:05.940
<i>He's headed to Iraq.</i>

37:06.040 --> 37:08.158
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

37:12.270 --> 37:15.549
The man with the blade,
he's a Jordanian militant.

37:15.649 --> 37:18.185
He's funded by bin Laden.
He's trained by bin Laden.

37:18.285 --> 37:20.555
He is loyal to bin Laden.

37:20.655 --> 37:24.225
His name is Zarqawi.

37:24.325 --> 37:28.846
Now, this asshole is right now
the crown prince of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

37:30.297 --> 37:33.768
His mercenary army, AQI,
they're 5,000 strong.

37:33.868 --> 37:35.920
Now, these guys
are not your average shit-kickers.

37:36.070 --> 37:38.407
These guys are well trained,
they are well paid.

37:38.507 --> 37:43.428
And right now, they are waging
the largest urban assault since Vietnam.

37:43.853 --> 37:47.965
Zarqawi and his lieutenants,
these are our top priority.

37:48.215 --> 37:51.086
Now, there is only one way
to root these guys out,

37:51.186 --> 37:54.222
and that is to go door to door,
house to house,

37:54.322 --> 37:58.776
until we find them or we find someone
who will give us their whereabouts.

37:59.026 --> 38:03.282
So, we are going to need to clear
10 structures an hour,

38:03.432 --> 38:06.368
which, I know, is a lot.
It's aggressive.

38:06.468 --> 38:09.537
We're gonna be loosening things up
with air support.

38:09.637 --> 38:13.575
This is the highest priority target
we have to date.

38:13.675 --> 38:18.696
I want this asshole dead or captured.
Do you understand?

38:18.846 --> 38:21.310
Are there any questions?

38:24.752 --> 38:27.089
I'll tell you something. These marines
keep rushing in like they're doing,

38:27.189 --> 38:29.757
- they're gonna have their asses shot off.
- Well, they're marines.

38:29.857 --> 38:32.826
They don't get the training we do.
Half these guys were civilians six months ago.

38:32.926 --> 38:35.563
Well, let's coach them up.
I'll show them how team guys do it.

38:35.663 --> 38:38.566
- I'll lead the unit on the street.
- No, can't do that. We need you on overwatch.

38:38.666 --> 38:40.468
Oh, come on.
If I'm on the street, Marc, I could...

38:40.568 --> 38:45.342
House-to-house is the deadliest job here.
You got some sort of savior complex?

38:45.442 --> 38:48.244
No, I just want to get the bad guys.
But if I can't see them, I can't shoot them.

38:48.344 --> 38:51.881
Look, all these guys, they know your name.
And they feel invincible with you up there.

38:51.981 --> 38:54.985
- They're not.
- They are if they think they are.

38:55.085 --> 38:59.582
Why don't you keep banging on the long gun?
We'll let these dogs sniff out Zarqawi.

39:09.532 --> 39:12.266
You said AQI has a sniper
in the Olympics,

39:12.366 --> 39:15.220
but Iraq hasn't qualified
a shooter in three games.

39:15.470 --> 39:18.425
Well, that's 'cause Mustafa's not Iraqi.

39:20.375 --> 39:22.369
He's from Syria.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.052
Regroup!

39:33.456 --> 39:35.623
Hey, once you all gain entry,
I can't see shit.

39:35.723 --> 39:38.294
So take it slow
and move through your target.

39:38.394 --> 39:41.313
- <i>Understood.</i>
- Fire in the hole!

39:41.563 --> 39:43.650
Go, go, go!

40:00.864 --> 40:02.504
Fuck this.

40:03.354 --> 40:06.190
I'm gonna go clear houses with marines.

40:06.290 --> 40:09.842
- You coming?
- Fuck no, I'm not coming.

40:10.092 --> 40:13.729
No, man. I like my life.
I'd actually like to make it home alive.

40:13.829 --> 40:16.099
Look, it's not my job to go fucking
knocking down doors, all right?

40:16.199 --> 40:18.970
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job.
I'm not doing that shit.

40:19.070 --> 40:22.173
All right, well,
if I don't see you down there,

40:22.273 --> 40:23.941
you make sure I don't see you again.

40:30.481 --> 40:33.248
Hey. Y'all mind if I roll with you?

40:33.348 --> 40:35.269
Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me.

40:36.752 --> 40:39.556
You're that guy, the one they're calling
The Legend. You got like 24 confirmed kills.

40:39.656 --> 40:42.758
- Well, who's counting?
- That's fucking bad-ass.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.396
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker
in Bravo's catching up, yo.

40:45.496 --> 40:48.065
Listen. I know y'all are meat-eaters,
for sure, but I know a couple things,

40:48.165 --> 40:50.701
some simple shit I could show you.
Maybe keep us above ground. What do you say?

40:50.801 --> 40:52.708
- Yeah.
- All right.

40:52.808 --> 40:54.405
Right on.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.433
- Hey, what's that mean, bro?
- Breacher up.

41:06.683 --> 41:09.553
- Moving.
- Get down! Get down on the ground right now!

41:09.653 --> 41:11.640
- Get your fucking ass down!
- No, no!

41:11.990 --> 41:14.358
- He no understand!
- Get down!

41:14.458 --> 41:18.096
Why are you here? You're supposed to be
evacuating this area. Why are you still here?

41:18.196 --> 41:21.432
- I am Sheikh Al-Obeidi.
- Sheik Alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?!

41:21.532 --> 41:24.136
- This is my home! I stay!
- I don't give a fuck it's your home!

41:24.236 --> 41:26.405
- This is a war zone, sir!
- Sir, please!

41:26.505 --> 41:29.641
- Get that kid down!
- No! No!

41:29.741 --> 41:31.911
- You, sir. Let me help you.
- Found these bitches in the back closet.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.828
You are welcome here. You are my guest.

41:33.928 --> 41:36.648
- How many more you have here?!
- But tell the soldiers to come in.

41:36.748 --> 41:39.683
No. This Hajji just wants us all
in here so he can blow us up.

41:39.783 --> 41:42.688
- Go check his ass for a...
- If he see American, he know we speak.

41:42.788 --> 41:45.923
- Who? Who? Who saw you talking to us?
- It's very dangerous. Please come in.

41:46.023 --> 41:48.898
- Who knows we're talking to you? Who?!
- He come. He come.

41:49.570 --> 41:52.329
He... he come. He...

41:55.099 --> 41:56.233
Very bad. Please.

41:56.333 --> 41:57.968
- This target's secure?
- Target secure.

41:58.068 --> 42:01.345
Bring them in. Get your head down on
the ground. Put your hands behind your back.

42:01.772 --> 42:03.174
Now! Move now!

42:03.274 --> 42:05.532
- Please! Please!
- You talk, we'll talk to you.

42:09.180 --> 42:10.634
Bring him in the other room.

42:17.240 --> 42:20.358
If he talks to U.S. soldiers, they will come
to his house and make examples of them.

42:20.458 --> 42:22.972
He? Who's he? Who's he?

42:26.284 --> 42:28.701
The man who comes, they call "The Butcher."
He's the despaired one.

42:28.801 --> 42:30.970
Son of Shaytan, son of... son of devil.

42:31.070 --> 42:33.252
Oh, he's like an enforcer?

42:34.403 --> 42:35.274
Yes, enforcer.

42:35.374 --> 42:37.643
- Number-one soldier Zarqawi.
- Zarqawi?

42:37.743 --> 42:39.771
- Zarqawi.
- Yeah, we'd like to know where Zarqawi is.

42:39.871 --> 42:42.548
You know where he is?
You tell us where he is right now.

42:42.648 --> 42:44.216
How can we get him?

42:44.316 --> 42:47.920
Do you have information for us
about Zarqawi? Tell us right now.

42:48.570 --> 42:50.614
You find the Butcher, you find Zarqawi.
He reports to him.

42:50.714 --> 42:53.131
Okay, well, how do we find him?

42:54.926 --> 42:57.947
All right, look at me when I'm talking
to you. Where do we find him?

43:00.066 --> 43:02.779
We must understand the risk to them,
but he will ask for money.

43:06.205 --> 43:09.006
- $100,000.
- You need $100,000?

43:09.106 --> 43:11.939
I have no proof this guy exists.

43:12.911 --> 43:14.814
Fatima!

43:14.914 --> 43:16.558
Howdy.

43:20.753 --> 43:22.267
Hello.

43:27.481 --> 43:29.125
This is the proof.

43:29.225 --> 43:31.355
All right, look, I wanna help you out.
I do. But I need something.

43:31.455 --> 43:36.017
I need phone numbers, address, names.
You have to give me something.

43:36.335 --> 43:39.705
- Sir. First platoon's pinned down.
- Let's move out!

43:39.805 --> 43:43.643
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you.
Hey! Look at me! I need something.

43:43.743 --> 43:45.879
I can help you out, Sheikh.

43:45.979 --> 43:48.281
You give me a name,
and we will take care of it.

43:48.381 --> 43:50.383
I can promise you that.
We will give you safety.

43:50.483 --> 43:54.169
- Tell me right now!
- Amir Khalaf Fanus!

43:54.419 --> 43:56.056
- Emile Anafanoos?
- Amir Khalaf Fanus.

43:56.156 --> 43:58.441
This is the given name of the Butcher.

43:58.891 --> 44:01.845
We believe that the Butcher
is Zarqawi's number two man.

44:02.195 --> 44:03.729
This is your guy right here.

44:03.829 --> 44:07.331
Yeah, but you don't know his real name.
Otherwise, you'd have written it up there.

44:08.001 --> 44:09.653
We got several aliases.

44:10.847 --> 44:13.172
Now, if "Fanus" is legit...

44:13.272 --> 44:17.676
- We'll... we'll go see the Sheikh.
- He's asking for 100,000.

44:17.776 --> 44:21.180
Figures. But if he delivers the Butcher,
he's gonna get it.

44:21.280 --> 44:26.918
This is agent Snead, DIA. I need
a name check on an Amir Khalaf Fanus.

44:27.018 --> 44:28.855
Yeah, I'll wait.

44:28.955 --> 44:31.357
If we're gonna go back out there,
team 3 can pull security.

44:31.457 --> 44:34.710
That's not gonna happen. Head shed's gonna
want contractors on it if we're humping money.

44:35.460 --> 44:37.749
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

44:41.069 --> 44:43.786
All right. Okay.

44:45.204 --> 44:47.502
Let's go see the Sheikh.

45:03.590 --> 45:05.325
Roadkill.

45:05.425 --> 45:07.960
You know the Butcher
is Zarqawi's enforcer?

45:08.060 --> 45:11.547
They say his weapon of choice
is a fucking drill.

45:11.997 --> 45:15.586
Went to seminary school
before I joined the Navy.

45:16.036 --> 45:18.172
Was close to being a preacher.

45:18.272 --> 45:20.889
And why didn't you?

45:21.507 --> 45:23.811
I love to gamble, man.

45:23.911 --> 45:26.228
Love those dice.

45:26.514 --> 45:27.857
That's my kind of preacher.

45:43.764 --> 45:45.404
It's like that now?

45:45.504 --> 45:48.585
Oh, haven't you heard? I'm The Legend.

45:49.035 --> 45:50.020
Hey, babe.

45:50.370 --> 45:53.190
You were right.
The doctor says it's a boy.

45:53.440 --> 45:54.624
What?

45:56.073 --> 45:57.561
It's a boy!

45:58.011 --> 46:00.209
It's a boy?!

46:00.559 --> 46:03.136
Hell, yeah, man. Congratulations!

46:18.365 --> 46:19.817
Chris?!

46:20.534 --> 46:22.661
Grab the money! Get to the drop!

46:30.711 --> 46:33.160
Go! Go! Grab the bag! Grab the bag!

46:36.251 --> 46:37.073
Chris!

46:42.423 --> 46:45.586
Go! Go! Get the fuck outta here!
We'll come back for them.

46:48.730 --> 46:50.065
Baby?

46:50.165 --> 46:52.065
- I heard one shot.
- Check.

46:52.165 --> 46:55.821
Came in at an angle.
Be 300 or more yards out.

46:55.971 --> 46:57.192
Oh, my God.

47:00.942 --> 47:03.790
- You got a bead on him?
- I got a tiny little window.

47:05.766 --> 47:10.528
Shit! I got eyes on the Butcher.
He's got the Sheikh's kid on the avenue.

47:17.525 --> 47:19.026
Requesting QRF.

47:19.126 --> 47:22.631
We're being pinned down by sniper fire
on approach of high value target.

47:22.731 --> 47:26.543
Grid 04536236. Over.

47:26.643 --> 47:29.504
I wanna pop a smoke 'em and secure
this building. I'm going to the roof.

47:34.043 --> 47:36.101
Hold up!

47:41.117 --> 47:43.353
- Hold.
- Holding.

47:45.221 --> 47:46.609
Go!

47:51.959 --> 47:55.279
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

49:42.804 --> 49:45.742
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch!

49:45.842 --> 49:47.768
Fuck you!

49:57.788 --> 49:59.974
Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess.

50:00.524 --> 50:04.019
You're one dumb son of a bitch, you know that?
What the hell were you thinking?

50:04.119 --> 50:07.297
You completely failed
to secure the battlefield.

50:07.397 --> 50:10.101
I'm shutting this whole thing down
pending an inquiry. Get back to base!

50:10.201 --> 50:14.371
- Hey, we gotta set up a squad and pursue him.
- Nope, they're shutting us down.

50:14.471 --> 50:15.705
What do you mean?

50:15.805 --> 50:17.909
Can't leave the wire
till they figure this shit out.

50:18.009 --> 50:23.471
Well, he can't just leave us like that.
Hey! I go home in three weeks!

50:24.314 --> 50:27.080
Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks.

51:04.789 --> 51:07.511
- How are you?
- What's going on, pop?

51:14.331 --> 51:15.887
Hey.

51:19.737 --> 51:21.681
Hey, baby.

51:22.640 --> 51:25.009
I thought you were dead.

51:25.109 --> 51:27.563
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:27.713 --> 51:31.066
- I thought you were dead.
- Well, I'm right here.

51:35.087 --> 51:37.026
Look at me.

51:40.292 --> 51:41.944
- You all right?
- Yeah.

52:01.780 --> 52:04.883
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

52:04.983 --> 52:08.052
I have an alien growing inside me.

52:09.345 --> 52:14.252
- And there's a strange man in my bedroom.
- Well, it's our bedroom.

52:18.063 --> 52:20.020
Your hands feel different.

52:23.870 --> 52:26.355
Oh, no. They're... they're my hands.

52:27.277 --> 52:29.705
- Why am I so fucking nervous?
- Well, I am, too.

52:29.805 --> 52:32.411
- No, you're not. You're lying.
- Yes, I am. I swear.

52:32.511 --> 52:36.015
How do I know some alien in there
is not gonna come out and grab me?

52:36.115 --> 52:37.883
In the middle of the night.

52:37.983 --> 52:40.143
Then I'm gonna have to...

52:41.052 --> 52:43.546
choke him out.

52:46.825 --> 52:48.027
It's gonna be okay.

52:48.127 --> 52:50.766
- Promise?
- Yeah, of course.

52:52.866 --> 52:55.725
Why're you so good with me?

53:02.908 --> 53:05.894
Hey, babe. It might be nice to get out.

53:06.344 --> 53:08.065
You listening to me?

53:09.015 --> 53:10.632
Chris.

53:12.390 --> 53:14.737
What do you wanna do today, hon?

53:18.154 --> 53:21.109
I thought we could just relax here.

53:23.562 --> 53:25.950
Okay, we do that.

53:27.300 --> 53:29.414
Let's relax.

53:30.122 --> 53:33.172
- What're you doing?
- Putting my foot on you.

53:33.272 --> 53:36.622
Well, you know that's...
that's the way to my heart.

53:38.277 --> 53:40.472
I'm coming over.

53:49.356 --> 53:51.292
And that looks great.

53:51.392 --> 53:53.720
Look. He's touching his nose.

53:53.820 --> 53:56.976
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right. I just want him out. I'm tired.

53:57.076 --> 53:59.766
- Well, it's gonna be any day now.
- I hope so.

53:59.866 --> 54:01.969
How 'bout you, Mr. Kyle?
How're you feeling?

54:02.069 --> 54:03.703
I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am.

54:03.803 --> 54:06.722
I imagine it's hard to decompress.

54:07.737 --> 54:09.275
Not really. No.

54:09.375 --> 54:11.878
This is the first time
we've left the house.

54:11.978 --> 54:14.401
I'm happy to be home. Yeah.

54:16.851 --> 54:20.370
Here, put this on for me, would ya?

54:21.001 --> 54:23.525
I think if you wanna check anything out,
you may wanna check out these knees.

54:23.625 --> 54:25.654
- Are you a smoker?
- No, ma'am.

54:25.754 --> 54:28.545
- You drink?
- Only when I'm thirsty.

54:35.702 --> 54:37.270
That's 170/110.

54:37.370 --> 54:40.774
- Jesus Christ, Chris.
- Is that high?

54:40.874 --> 54:44.578
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee.
But for someone who is sitting down...

54:44.678 --> 54:48.504
Oh, I appreciate you... taking a look
at that. I'll look into it.

54:48.604 --> 54:51.019
- Thank you.
- Will you look into it?

54:51.119 --> 54:52.706
Yeah.

54:54.674 --> 54:55.823
You sabotaged me back there.

54:55.923 --> 54:59.128
What am I supposed to do? You're not talking.
You act like it's all okay.

54:59.228 --> 55:01.764
- It is okay. I'm fine.
- You're not fine, Chris, all right?

55:01.864 --> 55:05.547
Your blood pressure is, like,
fucking 170/110. It's like...

55:05.647 --> 55:09.178
I'm driving down the freeway.
It's sunny. It's 72 degrees.

55:09.278 --> 55:11.606
I'm fine. There's a war going on.
There's people dying.

55:11.706 --> 55:13.842
No one's even talking about that.
It's like it's not even happening.

55:13.942 --> 55:18.067
We're all on our cell phones,
living our simple, simplistic lives.

55:18.167 --> 55:21.015
- It's not even on the news. No one cares.
- Chris.

55:21.115 --> 55:22.845
There's a war going on
and I'm headed to the mall.

55:22.945 --> 55:25.327
- Chris. It's happening.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

55:25.427 --> 55:27.789
- What's wrong? You okay?
- It's happening.

55:27.889 --> 55:29.807
Shit. Okay. I'm gonna go back.

55:33.737 --> 55:37.515
- You're fucking crazy! You know that?
- It's okay. Hey! Baby, baby.

55:37.865 --> 55:42.119
- Oh, my God. Baby.
- You look beautiful.

55:42.269 --> 55:44.856
It's fucking happening.

55:46.474 --> 55:49.497
Oh, my baby.

55:52.347 --> 55:54.558
Look at your mama.

55:55.550 --> 55:57.352
- Hey.
- Hi, baby.

55:57.452 --> 56:01.106
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, baby.

56:01.757 --> 56:05.294
Hey, little guy. Look what we did.

56:05.394 --> 56:08.397
Look what we did. Look what we made.

56:08.497 --> 56:10.615
Look what we made.

56:22.379 --> 56:24.880
The baby's crying.
I thought you were gonna get him.

56:24.980 --> 56:27.900
No, don't bother turning it off.
I already watched it.

56:28.050 --> 56:30.987
Had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi
girlfriend sending you sexy videos.

56:31.087 --> 56:33.179
That's a sniper recording his kills.
That's Mustafa.

56:33.279 --> 56:36.022
He sells that shit on the street.
Those are American soldiers.

56:37.493 --> 56:42.113
That day that we were on the phone,
was that him? Was it?

56:43.933 --> 56:47.269
Chris, just talk about it. You're not
protecting me by not talking about it.

56:47.369 --> 56:49.137
No, I don't want you getting that
in your head, ya understand?

56:49.237 --> 56:51.974
Well, my imagination is so much worse
than anything you could tell me.

56:52.074 --> 56:54.271
- Chris.
- Babe, They're fucking savages.

56:54.371 --> 56:55.804
It's not about them.

56:57.114 --> 56:59.132
It's about us.

57:00.324 --> 57:01.232
What?

57:06.621 --> 57:09.246
You have to make it back to us.

57:13.296 --> 57:15.324
Okay?

57:18.254 --> 57:21.821
Welcome home, chief. Colonel Jones
is waiting. How was the flight?

57:21.921 --> 57:24.622
- Damn longer than Christmas.
- I bet.

57:28.611 --> 57:32.299
- Hey. Can you wait a second?
- All right. Hurry up.

57:33.549 --> 57:35.419
Hey, grunt!

57:35.519 --> 57:39.021
- Chris?
- Hey, brother!

57:39.121 --> 57:40.624
Hi.

57:41.734 --> 57:43.059
You all right? You in one piece?

57:43.159 --> 57:46.799
I heard you been kicking ass out here, man.
All the guys, that's what they've been saying.

57:46.899 --> 57:48.665
- Yeah, that's what they say?
- Yeah.

57:48.765 --> 57:51.268
How ya doing? You okay?
Oh, shit, it's good to see you.

57:51.368 --> 57:54.872
You're my hero, bro. Okay?
You always have been.

57:54.972 --> 57:57.506
Let's go, Kyle! Colonel's waiting!

57:57.606 --> 57:59.592
The Legend?

58:01.475 --> 58:04.347
- What happened? You all right?
- Man, I'm gonna miss my ride.

58:04.447 --> 58:06.782
Hey, what happened?

58:06.882 --> 58:11.589
I'm just tired, man.
I'm... I'm going home.

58:12.389 --> 58:13.686
I'm proud of you.

58:15.592 --> 58:18.678
Dad is, too. Dad's proud of you.

58:19.728 --> 58:21.613
Fuck this place.

58:23.099 --> 58:26.924
- What'd you say?
- Fuck this place.

58:31.175 --> 58:34.149
Chief, we got to move! Let's go!

58:55.099 --> 58:58.818
- You made chief. Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

58:59.168 --> 59:03.491
Gronski's gone. A lot of the top brass are.
Running off a new playbook now.

59:04.641 --> 59:06.677
I've studied insurgencies
for the last decade.

59:06.777 --> 59:10.706
I know every stone thrown
since before the first century.

59:10.806 --> 59:15.119
These wars are won and lost
in the minds of our enemy.

59:15.219 --> 59:17.070
Yes, sir.

59:17.320 --> 59:19.039
That you?

59:19.289 --> 59:22.259
That's a crusader cross. Yes, sir.

59:22.359 --> 59:23.860
Yeah.

59:23.960 --> 59:26.167
You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.

59:26.267 --> 59:28.781
There's 180,000 on your head. Congrats.

59:28.881 --> 59:32.662
Well, don't tell my wife.
She might take that number right now.

59:33.303 --> 59:37.242
I understand you wanna put together
a direct action squad to hunt the Butcher.

59:37.342 --> 59:38.693
Yes, sir.

59:39.747 --> 59:43.181
We got some Intel indicating
his area of operations.

59:43.281 --> 59:47.485
I want you to put the fear
of God into these savages...

59:47.585 --> 59:49.920
and find his ass.

59:50.020 --> 59:51.840
Yes, sir.

59:52.190 --> 59:55.322
All right,
let's go get this motherfucker.

59:56.294 --> 59:58.563
Gonna be a pop quiz before we leave.

59:58.663 --> 01:00:00.597
- Small words next time, big legend.
- What'd you say?

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:02.132
Small words next time.

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:04.067
I'll tell you those stories
if you want 'em.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.722
- One hell of a PowerPoint, man.
- Oh, thanks, Biggles.

01:00:06.872 --> 01:00:08.874
Always gotta say something,
motherfucker.

01:00:08.974 --> 01:00:12.944
- That Bible of yours, is that bulletproof?
- What, the one I put in here?

01:00:13.044 --> 01:00:17.032
Yeah. I just... I never saw you
open it. I assumed...

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:20.993
God, country, family, right?

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:23.107
You got a God?

01:00:24.957 --> 01:00:27.825
I got a God? You getting weird on me?

01:00:29.895 --> 01:00:32.597
You know, growing up in Oregon, we had
this electric fence around our property.

01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:36.117
Us kids'd grab onto it
and see who could hold on the longest.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.337
War feels kinda like that.

01:00:39.437 --> 01:00:43.693
Puts lightning in your bones and makes it
hard to hold on to anything else.

01:00:44.543 --> 01:00:46.282
Hey, man, you need to sit this one out?

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.517
I just wanna believe
in what we're doing here.

01:00:50.617 --> 01:00:53.203
Oh, there's evil here. We've seen it.

01:00:53.753 --> 01:00:55.537
Yeah. There's evil everywhere.

01:00:55.787 --> 01:00:58.941
Oh, you want these motherfuckers
to come to San Diego or New York?

01:00:59.898 --> 01:01:02.580
We're protecting more
than just this dirt.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:06.332
All right.

01:01:06.432 --> 01:01:08.690
Let's go kill this fucker.

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:21.901
Bingo. It's the building right here.

01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:25.366
Any apartment on the east side
faces the restaurant.

01:01:27.285 --> 01:01:30.115
Go in, sir. Go, go, go.

01:01:31.423 --> 01:01:32.617
Clear.

01:01:43.335 --> 01:01:45.227
Other door.

01:01:53.979 --> 01:01:56.265
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Get down on the ground right now.

01:01:56.815 --> 01:01:59.608
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Okay.

01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:07.995
Target secure.

01:02:08.095 --> 01:02:09.763
I got the window, Chris.

01:02:09.863 --> 01:02:11.998
- Set security, boys.
- All right, let's get set up.

01:02:12.098 --> 01:02:13.767
Corner.

01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:16.435
Let's move them into the other room.

01:02:19.101 --> 01:02:22.325
Y'all ask if he knows him.
You recognize this guy?

01:02:24.978 --> 01:02:26.297
He says he does not.

01:02:27.347 --> 01:02:29.405
How 'bout you, son?
You recognize this face?

01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:32.966
You sure?

01:02:34.387 --> 01:02:37.983
Well, you know, you make sure you tell 'em
they're not gonna go anywhere until we do.

01:02:41.661 --> 01:02:43.197
Hey, you keep eyes on that window.

01:02:43.297 --> 01:02:46.853
Make sure you take pictures
of anybody coming and going.

01:03:04.284 --> 01:03:06.229
What do we got?

01:03:07.487 --> 01:03:11.225
- 16 military-aged males have gone in.
- 16?

01:03:11.325 --> 01:03:15.228
Yeah, they serve more customers
than a fucking McDonald's.

01:03:15.328 --> 01:03:17.710
Here, check this out.

01:03:22.236 --> 01:03:23.804
Is he still in there?

01:03:23.904 --> 01:03:27.641
I clocked one point of entry. He's in there,
but it's not gonna be an easy breach.

01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:29.510
Oh, I don't know about that, man.

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.913
Probably see The Legend and just let him
right in, you know, big-time celebrity.

01:03:33.013 --> 01:03:37.419
Ask him to sign their burka.
Appear at their child's birthday parties.

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:39.954
Hey, what is your problem?
I didn't... I didn't promote myself.

01:03:40.054 --> 01:03:42.223
Yeah, no shit, motherfucker.
I did that for you.

01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:47.444
You woulda never made chief if I hadn't
nicknamed you the fucking myth or some shit.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.004
He invites you to join him
for an Eid Al Adha supper.

01:03:57.104 --> 01:04:01.225
He says, "on this day,
everyone has a seat at my table."

01:04:01.475 --> 01:04:04.095
Oh, that's pretty generous of him.

01:04:12.486 --> 01:04:15.201
That was, like, close, man.

01:04:19.426 --> 01:04:23.397
Take a cucumber. Take cucumber
and put it in a tub with vinegar.

01:04:23.497 --> 01:04:24.431
Yeah.

01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:28.902
Stick in cayenne pepper and a lemon...
and let it soak overnight.

01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:32.907
It's that, and just add vodka.
That's the idea. You wanna get in on it?

01:04:33.007 --> 01:04:35.844
Let's do it, dude.
I'm a ground-floor investor.

01:04:35.944 --> 01:04:38.883
Biggles, you never cooked
a day in your life.

01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:43.217
Dude, that was the real question.

01:04:43.317 --> 01:04:46.848
- That was super real.
- All these random people getting behind us.

01:04:48.957 --> 01:04:52.109
Oh, my God, I fell in behind the myth.

01:04:53.661 --> 01:04:55.580
Holy shit.

01:05:09.478 --> 01:05:14.300
- Come on, man. Get some brains.
- I gotta wash my hands.

01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:34.448
Hey, hey, hey!

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:38.033
- Go check that out.
- Stay right here. Stay here.

01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:41.056
- Hey, what the fuck?!
- Biggles, help me out.

01:06:43.373 --> 01:06:45.725
See that, Muj?

01:06:46.075 --> 01:06:47.160
You see that?

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.076
- What the fuck's going on?
- Bring the terp in.

01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:51.294
Oh, shit.

01:06:53.216 --> 01:06:57.221
All right. Now you tell him
that he's gonna be sent off to detention

01:06:57.321 --> 01:07:00.056
and the Iraqi courts can decide
what to do with him.

01:07:00.156 --> 01:07:02.476
Or he can help us get inside
of that restaurant downstairs.

01:07:02.626 --> 01:07:05.379
You tell him. Say it's his choice.

01:07:36.838 --> 01:07:38.244
That's it.

01:07:39.563 --> 01:07:41.482
All clear.

01:07:42.265 --> 01:07:44.588
Good, good. Moving.

01:07:47.429 --> 01:07:48.760
Assault team set.

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:56.436
- We're in tight. Security set.
- Package is moving.

01:08:11.095 --> 01:08:12.750
15 meters out.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.354
10 meters.

01:08:21.205 --> 01:08:22.301
5 meters.

01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:32.483
He's knocking.

01:08:37.354 --> 01:08:38.380
Hold.

01:08:39.957 --> 01:08:41.029
They're vetting him.

01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:45.212
Lights out, Muj.

01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:47.522
Execute. Execute.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.733
Frag out! Frag out!

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:09.506
- Biggles, anything coming out the back?
- <i>Negative. No movement.</i>

01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:14.848
Oh, shit.

01:09:20.298 --> 01:09:23.019
- "D," take him down.
- Got him.

01:09:24.969 --> 01:09:26.126
Get him down.

01:09:30.576 --> 01:09:31.643
Oh, shit!

01:09:31.743 --> 01:09:34.082
<i>We found a tunnel. Watch your back.
Keep your eyes open.</i>

01:09:36.151 --> 01:09:38.371
Contact! Contact!

01:09:42.587 --> 01:09:45.305
Contact! Drop back!

01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:50.881
White-side! RPG on the white-side!

01:10:42.915 --> 01:10:45.035
Butcher's on the move.

01:10:45.285 --> 01:10:48.400
Repeat, Butcher's on the move.
I'm in pursuit.

01:10:57.834 --> 01:11:01.351
Butcher's down. Move in your position.

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:25.658
I mean, I offered him detention.
It was his choice.

01:11:25.758 --> 01:11:28.535
Picked the wrong side.
It's all there is to it. Fog of war.

01:11:31.464 --> 01:11:35.553
Yo, Chris! Fuck it, man.
Let's go. Shit's getting hairy.

01:11:35.653 --> 01:11:38.220
Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way.
We need to make tracks.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.504
Heck of a job there, chief.

01:12:24.152 --> 01:12:26.954
- You want another one, or are you good?
- Look. What is this?

01:12:27.054 --> 01:12:29.391
No. Well, you get what it gives you.
That's how this thing works.

01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:31.526
You don't get that one,
if that's the one you want.

01:12:31.626 --> 01:12:33.211
I like that.

01:12:41.636 --> 01:12:43.371
That's good. That's strong.

01:12:43.471 --> 01:12:46.341
- Chris Kyle, come on. Your truck's ready.
- You can move that all you want.

01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:49.043
Your truck's ready. Im... impossible.

01:12:49.143 --> 01:12:52.346
- Give me your credit card.
- Okay. Interesting.

01:12:52.446 --> 01:12:54.438
- I already gave it to ya, I think.
- Oh, right.

01:12:55.577 --> 01:12:58.734
What? Hey, just pick that up
off the floor.

01:12:58.834 --> 01:13:01.739
Make sure you get all of them up.
Well, you got one back here.

01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:03.099
Excuse me, sir?

01:13:05.894 --> 01:13:08.513
- Are you chief Chris Kyle?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:09.477 --> 01:13:13.620
My name is Mads. We met in Fallujah.
You saved my life.

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:18.524
- I did?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:21.443
We were stuck in a house
until you came in with the 1st marines.

01:13:21.543 --> 01:13:24.064
You were the one that carried me out.

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:26.414
Oh, wow. Well, the marines
saved our ass plenty of times.

01:13:26.514 --> 01:13:28.951
- How are you? You all right? You holding up?
- Great. Yeah.

01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:34.021
I'm... I'm just grateful to be alive.
It hasn't been...

01:13:34.121 --> 01:13:36.366
- Colt.
- It hasn't been easy.

01:13:36.466 --> 01:13:38.643
Well, you know.

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:42.912
A lot of guys lost more than just a leg.

01:13:43.599 --> 01:13:45.061
Did you lose some friends?

01:13:45.199 --> 01:13:47.553
Well, that, too.
But I'm talking 'bout the guys that lived.

01:13:47.703 --> 01:13:50.539
That made it back, but they're just not...
they're just not back, you know?

01:13:50.639 --> 01:13:53.075
- They can't seem to get right.
- Yeah.

01:13:55.509 --> 01:13:58.980
Why don't you come down to the V.A.
sometime? The guys would love it.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.032
They all know who The Legend is.

01:14:02.536 --> 01:14:05.769
- Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
- Hey, buddy.

01:14:06.788 --> 01:14:09.189
Can I tell you something?

01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:13.043
Your dad? He's a hero.

01:14:13.694 --> 01:14:18.234
That's right.
He saved my life, and he...

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:20.436
he helped me get back to my little girl.

01:14:20.536 --> 01:14:24.023
- So, thank you for lending him to us.
- Okay.

01:14:24.473 --> 01:14:27.192
I wouldn't be here without him.

01:14:32.982 --> 01:14:34.742
My family thanks you for your service.

01:14:37.086 --> 01:14:40.557
Okay, thank you. All right.
Take care of yourself.

01:14:40.657 --> 01:14:42.124
- It's great to see you again.
- All right.

01:14:42.224 --> 01:14:44.793
- Come down to the V.A. sometime.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:14:44.893 --> 01:14:46.290
Grab your little lizard up there.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:50.788
Thank you.

01:14:50.888 --> 01:14:51.962
- You're welcome.
- Have a good day.

01:14:52.062 --> 01:14:54.538
- You have a good day.
- Okay.

01:14:54.638 --> 01:14:57.628
All right, let's go meet
your sister, bubba.

01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:28.723
Hey. Some help here?
My daughter's crying.

01:15:32.575 --> 01:15:34.194
That's my daughter over there.
I think she's crying.

01:15:34.294 --> 01:15:37.165
Can you help tend to her, please?
Excuse me.

01:15:39.115 --> 01:15:41.918
Hey! Hey, where you going?

01:15:42.018 --> 01:15:43.671
Hey!

01:15:43.941 --> 01:15:46.776
Hey, will you tend
to my daughter, please?

01:15:47.924 --> 01:15:49.642
Hey!

01:15:52.762 --> 01:15:56.817
Hey! Tend to my daughter, please!
Right now!

01:15:58.382 --> 01:16:01.689
I'm making memories by myself.

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.159
I have no one to share them with.

01:16:06.643 --> 01:16:10.166
Yeah, well, we got
our whole lives for that.

01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:14.701
When does that start?

01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:18.205
Even when you're here, you're not here.

01:16:18.955 --> 01:16:22.506
I see you. I feel you.

01:16:23.059 --> 01:16:25.582
But you're not here.

01:16:42.044 --> 01:16:44.199
I hate the teams for it.

01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:47.535
I do.

01:16:48.185 --> 01:16:50.054
You're my husband.

01:16:50.154 --> 01:16:53.467
You're the father of my children,
but they're the ones that pull you back.

01:17:00.029 --> 01:17:03.355
Yeah, but, you see, they...
they can't wait, and we can.

01:17:08.405 --> 01:17:11.729
If you think this war
isn't changing you, you're wrong.

01:17:14.679 --> 01:17:18.376
You can only circle the flame so long.

01:17:28.826 --> 01:17:30.150
It's true.

01:17:47.846 --> 01:17:49.140
Cadillac 31 actual,

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.347
we're tailing the Butcher's courier
currently on Maryland street. Over.

01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:55.837
Hey! Got the ring.

01:17:56.687 --> 01:17:57.988
From where? From here?

01:17:58.088 --> 01:18:00.407
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah.
It's so much cheaper here.

01:18:00.957 --> 01:18:04.063
Dude, you bought it from savages?
How do you know it's not a blood diamond?

01:18:04.163 --> 01:18:05.865
Oh, what the fuck do you care, man?

01:18:05.965 --> 01:18:08.468
You've spilled so much blood over here.
You're The Legend.

01:18:08.568 --> 01:18:10.385
Oh, that's not for a rock.

01:18:10.535 --> 01:18:12.687
What the fuck ever, man.

01:18:13.337 --> 01:18:14.741
That's just hypocritical.

01:18:14.841 --> 01:18:16.208
Hey, ease up on that.
No, don't get too close.

01:18:16.308 --> 01:18:19.094
- All right. Hey, I know.
- Did you tell her where you bought it from?

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:21.892
Fuck no. I'm gonna tell her
I got that shit from Zales.

01:18:24.249 --> 01:18:26.385
<i>Hey, you still with us, cookie?</i>

01:18:26.485 --> 01:18:30.238
Just a half block back, baby.
We are wet and ready, big giggles.

01:18:30.388 --> 01:18:32.357
You know, "D"...

01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:35.727
I predict in 20 years,
we're gonna have a reunion...

01:18:35.827 --> 01:18:37.546
and you'll be married to a dude.

01:18:38.216 --> 01:18:40.867
As long as you cook and clean.

01:18:49.508 --> 01:18:52.169
- Now, there they are.
- Oh, shit.

01:18:53.112 --> 01:18:54.746
Mustafa's got his peepers out.

01:18:54.846 --> 01:18:58.271
This motherfucker
is Keyser fucking Soze, bro.

01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:17.570
Hey, next time you get a clear shot,
you try not to miss him, all right?

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.923
Well, I would've gotten him in the alleyway
if I didn't have to save your ass.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.669
So you gonna be my best man?

01:19:50.769 --> 01:19:52.506
Oh, just me?
Or is it gonna be everybody else, too?

01:19:52.606 --> 01:19:54.455
There's only gonna be
one best man, dude.

01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:03.733
Vehicle 1 taking fire.

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.923
- Come on, give me a shot.
- All right.

01:20:26.173 --> 01:20:28.095
Biggles, move.

01:20:33.448 --> 01:20:35.066
Clear.

01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:37.277
One on me.

01:20:49.329 --> 01:20:50.398
<i>We got him.</i>

01:20:50.498 --> 01:20:53.167
<i>Vehicle is secure.</i>

01:20:53.267 --> 01:20:55.477
<i>Set security, Chris.</i>

01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:57.421
Nope.

01:20:57.671 --> 01:20:59.156
Rooftop secure.

01:21:00.347 --> 01:21:02.576
Aren't you worried that she's
gonna take that thing to Zales,

01:21:02.676 --> 01:21:05.148
find out how much you spent?

01:21:05.412 --> 01:21:07.915
- Well, no, I wasn't.
- Set security.

01:21:08.015 --> 01:21:10.517
- Now I'm a little worried about it.
- You should be.

01:21:10.617 --> 01:21:12.853
What do you mean,
she can trace the diamond to Zales?

01:21:12.953 --> 01:21:14.080
I don't think that's gonna...

01:21:17.325 --> 01:21:19.981
You okay, buddy? You're all right.

01:21:25.909 --> 01:21:30.458
Got a man down. Biggles is down.
Northwest corner, rooftop!

01:21:34.408 --> 01:21:35.518
Hang in there, bud.

01:21:40.413 --> 01:21:42.908
I need a corpsman right now!

01:21:53.295 --> 01:21:56.375
Okay, bubba. We're gonna pick you up
and take you downstairs.

01:21:59.267 --> 01:22:01.227
I can walk.

01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:17.748
Get him in the Humvee.
Get him in the Humvee.

01:22:17.848 --> 01:22:18.954
Breaking off.

01:22:19.054 --> 01:22:21.873
I got him. I got him.

01:22:25.038 --> 01:22:27.696
- Come on. Get in. Hang in there, Biggles.
- Fuck.

01:22:27.796 --> 01:22:29.697
Hang in there, Biggles.

01:22:29.797 --> 01:22:32.086
Hang in, Biggles.

01:22:34.636 --> 01:22:37.037
- It's okay.
- Shit, I'm sorry, man.

01:22:37.137 --> 01:22:40.642
For what? What are you sorry for?
It's my fault we went on that roof.

01:22:40.742 --> 01:22:42.244
Am I gonna die?

01:22:42.344 --> 01:22:46.181
Fuck no, Biggles. You're a fucking frogman.
Frogmen don't fucking die.

01:22:46.281 --> 01:22:49.584
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut.
We'll get you a fucking canteen of water.

01:22:49.684 --> 01:22:51.452
You're gonna be fucking fine, Biggles.
Hang in there.

01:22:51.552 --> 01:22:54.442
Hey, Chris. You make sure
she gets that ring, all right?

01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:56.305
Sure will.

01:23:00.529 --> 01:23:03.382
All right, let's decrease suction.
The retractor, please.

01:23:03.832 --> 01:23:06.203
More blood.
How long before we get film on him?

01:23:06.303 --> 01:23:09.771
We need another unit of blood.
Give me a 3 only.

01:23:09.871 --> 01:23:11.907
- All right, saline... now.
- More suction.

01:23:12.007 --> 01:23:14.743
- Hold your hands right here.
- Okay.

01:23:14.843 --> 01:23:17.988
Type and cross.
I need those numbers now.

01:23:26.866 --> 01:23:28.541
Did you see where it came from?

01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:32.094
Yeah, it was more than 1,000 meters out.

01:23:32.194 --> 01:23:34.549
Only one enemy sniper
coulda made that shot.

01:23:36.399 --> 01:23:37.420
Will he make it?

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.603
Took a round off
the feed tray cover. Was 48.

01:23:40.703 --> 01:23:42.604
Doesn't look good.

01:23:42.704 --> 01:23:44.842
That's the first SEAL hit, sir.

01:23:44.942 --> 01:23:46.859
Fuck!

01:23:47.609 --> 01:23:51.580
Shi'a cab driver we source is saying
there's a stronghold seven doors down.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.366
Marine units covered your exfil
are still engaged there.

01:23:54.725 --> 01:23:59.538
I can understand if you want
to stand down and regroup. It's up to you.

01:23:59.889 --> 01:24:02.295
Lex talionis.

01:24:02.395 --> 01:24:04.533
Eye for an eye.

01:24:09.264 --> 01:24:11.380
We're going back out.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.421
- Fucking "A."
- Fuck, yes.

01:24:13.971 --> 01:24:15.757
Let's go.

01:24:16.807 --> 01:24:18.425
It's on.

01:24:47.972 --> 01:24:49.029
Hey!

01:24:52.376 --> 01:24:54.666
Two klicks out.

01:25:21.605 --> 01:25:23.538
Hallway clear.

01:25:23.742 --> 01:25:26.496
On the left. Bumping.

01:25:29.546 --> 01:25:31.521
Hallway.

01:25:34.052 --> 01:25:37.120
Hallway clear. On the left.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.798
Clear.

01:25:40.274 --> 01:25:42.143
All clear.

01:25:45.964 --> 01:25:47.325
All clear.

01:25:48.631 --> 01:25:51.619
Hey, Marc.
Looks like someone left in a hurry.

01:25:59.075 --> 01:26:00.545
- Man down!
- Cover the window!

01:26:00.645 --> 01:26:02.462
Man down!

01:26:02.712 --> 01:26:05.208
- Cut that window!
- Cut that window!

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:16.647
Come on, Marc.

01:26:19.297 --> 01:26:23.553
Let's go, buddy. I got you, man. I got you.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:26:25.103 --> 01:26:26.889
I got you.

01:26:35.969 --> 01:26:37.267
Marc's gone, bro.

01:26:39.717 --> 01:26:42.953
I got one SEAL down.
I need cabs back immediately.

01:26:43.053 --> 01:26:45.173
We gotta fucking move him.

01:26:53.586 --> 01:26:56.714
"Glory is something some men chase,

01:26:56.814 --> 01:26:59.705
"and others find themselves
stumbling upon

01:26:59.805 --> 01:27:02.440
"not expecting to find it.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.177
"Either way,
it is a noble gesture that one...

01:27:05.327 --> 01:27:07.246
"finds bestowed upon them.

01:27:07.346 --> 01:27:13.334
"My question is, when does glory fade away
and become a wrongful crusade?

01:27:13.484 --> 01:27:17.963
"Or an unjustified means
by which consumes one...

01:27:18.063 --> 01:27:20.895
"completely? I've...

01:27:21.494 --> 01:27:24.162
"seen war...

01:27:24.262 --> 01:27:28.134
"and I've seen... death."

01:27:28.234 --> 01:27:30.586
Detail. Ten-hut!

01:27:32.036 --> 01:27:34.622
Port arms!

01:27:35.407 --> 01:27:37.142
Ready!

01:27:37.242 --> 01:27:38.744
Aim.

01:27:38.844 --> 01:27:40.580
Fire!

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.547
Ready.

01:27:42.647 --> 01:27:43.732
Aim.

01:27:44.182 --> 01:27:45.619
Fire!

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:47.418
Ready.

01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:50.423
Aim. Fire!

01:27:50.523 --> 01:27:53.483
Present arms!

01:28:47.012 --> 01:28:50.001
Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago.

01:28:52.151 --> 01:28:54.904
Did he say any of that to you?

01:29:02.927 --> 01:29:06.083
Chris, I wanna know
what you thought of his letter.

01:29:07.292 --> 01:29:12.455
An AQI informant had called in a tip, and...
Biggles had just been shot.

01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:16.543
We were operating out of emotion,
and we just walked right into an ambush.

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:19.862
But that's not what killed him.

01:29:20.612 --> 01:29:22.882
That letter did.
That letter killed Marc.

01:29:22.982 --> 01:29:27.633
He just... he let go,
and he paid the price for it.

01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:40.461
Sign in here?

01:29:50.811 --> 01:29:52.640
Hey, buddy.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.781
- Hey, Chris?
- Yeah.

01:29:54.881 --> 01:29:56.633
- Where you at, man?
- I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:29:56.983 --> 01:30:00.718
- Shit, you're blind as a bat.
- Yeah, it fucking blows.

01:30:00.818 --> 01:30:04.326
- They say they're gonna fix my face, though.
- Oh, thank God.

01:30:04.426 --> 01:30:07.995
- About time. Your face needs some fixing.
- It's too soon, man.

01:30:08.095 --> 01:30:10.431
- It is too soon?
- Way too soon.

01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:13.434
- Hey, I heard you proposed.
- Yeah.

01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:17.171
Well, good for you. You didn't
tell her you bought that diamond...

01:30:17.271 --> 01:30:19.483
- you told her you bought it at Zales, right?
- No.

01:30:19.583 --> 01:30:23.010
- You didn't?
- No. No, got a new one.

01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:25.179
It's a smaller one.
Her dad helped me out with it.

01:30:25.279 --> 01:30:26.347
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

01:30:26.447 --> 01:30:28.383
Oh, good.

01:30:28.483 --> 01:30:30.403
She wouldn't leave me, bro.

01:30:32.653 --> 01:30:35.038
I told her to go,
and she wouldn't leave.

01:30:35.991 --> 01:30:38.909
She's getting a raw fucking deal.

01:30:39.359 --> 01:30:43.704
Why would you say that?
Don't say that. She's got you.

01:30:45.767 --> 01:30:49.526
- All two inches of you.
- Two inches.

01:30:50.438 --> 01:30:53.908
Yeah, you know, I'm glad
this happened to me and not you.

01:30:54.008 --> 01:30:57.694
- Ain't no way you coulda handled it.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

01:30:58.274 --> 01:31:01.617
So they say you're the deadliest sniper
in U.S. military history.

01:31:01.717 --> 01:31:04.671
- Oh, is that right?
- That's what I heard.

01:31:06.421 --> 01:31:09.858
- The bad guys ended up in Sadr City.
- You're not going back.

01:31:09.958 --> 01:31:11.826
Yeah, we are. We're gonna
wall 'em in and hunt 'em down.

01:31:11.926 --> 01:31:13.527
Nah, come on, man.
You don't have to do that.

01:31:13.627 --> 01:31:16.766
Oh, we have to do that.
You're my brother.

01:31:16.866 --> 01:31:19.793
And they're gonna fucking pay
for what they did to you.

01:31:21.535 --> 01:31:24.171
Hooyah, Legend.

01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:25.860
Fucking hooyah.

01:31:31.746 --> 01:31:36.518
Something happens to me,
you'd be all right.

01:31:36.618 --> 01:31:39.473
You'd find someone else.

01:31:41.423 --> 01:31:43.892
Do you wanna die?

01:31:43.992 --> 01:31:45.992
Is that what it is?

01:31:46.092 --> 01:31:47.814
No.

01:31:48.364 --> 01:31:50.215
Then just tell me.

01:31:51.365 --> 01:31:52.802
Tell me why you do it.

01:31:52.902 --> 01:31:54.437
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna understand.

01:31:54.537 --> 01:31:56.906
Babe, I do it for you. You know that.
I do it to protect you.

01:31:57.006 --> 01:31:59.274
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:31:59.374 --> 01:32:00.906
I'm here.

01:32:01.006 --> 01:32:03.661
Your family is here.
Your children have no father.

01:32:03.761 --> 01:32:07.216
- Well, I have to serve my country.
- That is such fucking bullshit!

01:32:07.316 --> 01:32:10.897
- No, it's not.
- You don't know when to quit.

01:32:11.486 --> 01:32:15.291
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough.
You let somebody else go.

01:32:15.391 --> 01:32:17.226
- Let somebody else go?
- Yeah.

01:32:17.326 --> 01:32:20.595
- I couldn't live with myself.
- Yeah, well, you find a way.

01:32:20.695 --> 01:32:22.018
You have to.

01:32:27.168 --> 01:32:31.610
Okay, I need you to be human again.

01:32:33.308 --> 01:32:34.728
I need you here.

01:32:36.778 --> 01:32:39.724
Baby, I need you here.

01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:45.004
If you leave again...

01:32:45.355 --> 01:32:48.265
I don't think we'll be here
when you get back.

01:32:53.997 --> 01:32:55.406
Come here.

01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:17.253
Chris. Oh, man.

01:33:17.353 --> 01:33:20.190
We've been shot off position
three nights in a row, man.

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:22.958
Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.

01:33:23.058 --> 01:33:26.395
- This shit is fucking biblical, Chris.
- Is there any other punishers here?

01:33:26.495 --> 01:33:30.599
Squirrel cycled out. And Dauber was
coming back, but his wife knocked him up.

01:33:30.699 --> 01:33:34.103
And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll
murder my motherfucking ass, Chris.

01:33:34.203 --> 01:33:36.439
- Teams and shit, right?
- Teams and shit.

01:33:36.539 --> 01:33:38.242
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man.

01:33:38.342 --> 01:33:42.674
I went to see him in the hospital
before I left. Motherfucker can't see shit.

01:33:43.013 --> 01:33:44.668
Biggles is gone, Chris.

01:33:45.969 --> 01:33:49.540
He was in surgery yesterday, and...
he died on that table.

01:33:57.826 --> 01:34:01.431
<i>Hey, this is Taya. I can't get to the phone,
so please leave a message.</i>

01:34:01.531 --> 01:34:04.969
<i>It's me... Just calling
to hear your voice.</i>

01:34:05.069 --> 01:34:09.656
<i>I'm missing you guys. Been thinking
about some things you said.</i>

01:34:10.106 --> 01:34:13.837
<i>Tell the kids I love 'em.
I love you, too.</i>

01:35:21.346 --> 01:35:22.856
Don't pick it up.

01:35:26.785 --> 01:35:28.772
Don't you fucking pick it up.

01:35:34.158 --> 01:35:35.982
Son of a bitch.

01:35:39.732 --> 01:35:41.419
Fucking drop it.

01:35:54.479 --> 01:35:56.100
Drop it, you little cocksucker.

01:36:25.376 --> 01:36:28.937
All right, listen up. The head-shed believe
this T-wall here will help win the war

01:36:29.037 --> 01:36:31.485
by trapping remaining AQI behind it.

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.701
Problem is the engineers building
the goddamn things

01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:36.855
are getting picked off by one single sniper
from deep behind the wall.

01:36:36.955 --> 01:36:38.664
How deep?

01:36:38.764 --> 01:36:41.100
- Roughly 1,000 meters.
- Is it Mustafa?

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.696
- Mu-who?
- I don't know, dude.

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.797
The sniper who killed
our fucking friend Biggles, man.

01:36:44.897 --> 01:36:48.258
He can be whoever the fuck you need him
to be. We just need him dead.

01:36:48.358 --> 01:36:50.702
We'll shuttle you six blocks north
into enemy territory,

01:36:50.802 --> 01:36:53.607
which will put you right up under the sniper's
nose when he takes his shot, okay?

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:57.143
- In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?
- Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi.

01:36:57.243 --> 01:37:01.714
We need to shut this shooter down.
Understood? Gear up.

01:37:01.814 --> 01:37:04.899
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:26.933 --> 01:38:28.827
It's clear. Move out.

01:39:09.978 --> 01:39:11.046
Clear.

01:39:11.146 --> 01:39:12.695
- We're maneuver. You're base.
- Yep.

01:39:12.795 --> 01:39:14.499
Go.

01:39:14.849 --> 01:39:16.169
Go!

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:23.625
- Clear.
- Moving.

01:39:23.725 --> 01:39:25.436
Go! Go!

01:39:27.427 --> 01:39:28.930
All clear.

01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:31.113
Set security.

01:40:09.805 --> 01:40:12.270
The streets are crawling.
Hold your fire.

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:25.163
Enter the fucking sandman.

01:41:04.527 --> 01:41:06.149
- Man down!
- Man back!

01:41:09.599 --> 01:41:11.056
Shit!

01:41:11.156 --> 01:41:13.965
Shot came from the east!

01:41:19.141 --> 01:41:22.123
We set up
in the wrong fucking direction.

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:26.739
Doesn't matter. Hold your fire.
We got uglies right below us.

01:41:59.949 --> 01:42:02.668
I got something 1,900 yards out.

01:42:02.918 --> 01:42:06.940
Fuck, you can't even see that far out.
Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.325
He's right, Legend. <i>No bueno.</i>

01:42:09.425 --> 01:42:12.746
Correction. It's 2,100 yards out.

01:42:13.896 --> 01:42:16.386
That's more than a mile.
Impossible shot, Chris.

01:42:28.856 --> 01:42:29.998
It's him.

01:42:32.048 --> 01:42:36.053
This is task unit bruiser.
I got eyes on target. Initiate QRF. Over.

01:42:36.153 --> 01:42:39.855
Copy that. ET on quick reaction force
is 20 minutes out.

01:42:55.005 --> 01:42:58.419
- He has eyes on our guys.
- Can you confirm it's him?

01:43:01.044 --> 01:43:03.129
It's him.

01:43:03.479 --> 01:43:06.267
- Oh, it's him.
- It's your call, Chris.

01:43:06.817 --> 01:43:10.057
Quick reaction force is 20 minutes out.
You'll stand the fuck down!

01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:25.020
If you got it, take it, man.

01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:30.758
Aim small, miss small.

01:43:31.108 --> 01:43:32.860
Do it for Biggles.

01:44:06.912 --> 01:44:08.456
You just fucked us, Legend.

01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:12.685
Tango down.

01:44:12.785 --> 01:44:14.653
We need QRF asap!

01:44:19.224 --> 01:44:21.009
Mission accomplished.

01:44:21.359 --> 01:44:23.311
He had eyes on our guys.

01:44:23.461 --> 01:44:28.199
- <i>And I took him out.</i>
- Yeah. Now we're fucked like a football bat.

01:44:30.468 --> 01:44:32.022
Biggles would be proud.

01:44:34.359 --> 01:44:35.826
You did it, Chris.

01:44:38.476 --> 01:44:42.047
Echo 7 kilo, be advised you have enemy
approaching all directions of your pos.

01:44:42.147 --> 01:44:45.017
White-side! Goddamn it, Legend. Fuck!

01:44:45.117 --> 01:44:47.271
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

01:44:53.364 --> 01:44:56.794
All right, I see two ways up onto the roof.
We wanna lock both staircases.

01:44:56.894 --> 01:44:58.217
<i>Conserve ammo.</i>

01:45:29.062 --> 01:45:31.339
Get some, motherfuckers.

01:45:57.689 --> 01:46:01.074
Echo 7 kilo, you have tango-heavy gun
on your green-side.

01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:47.443
<i>We're taking effective fire, white-side!
Effective fire, white-side!</i>

01:46:56.181 --> 01:47:00.372
- "D", I'm down to two mags! We gotta move!
- Don't stop fucking shooting, man!

01:47:02.162 --> 01:47:04.278
QRF's stuck three blocks out.

01:47:15.436 --> 01:47:18.355
- <i>I'm out!</i>
- 3 o'clock. Loading last mag.

01:47:18.905 --> 01:47:20.841
<i>I've only got one mag left!</i>

01:47:20.941 --> 01:47:23.677
<i>I'm black! I'm black!
Anybody got a mag?!</i>

01:47:23.777 --> 01:47:26.412
<i>We can't hold 'em any longer!
We gotta move!</i>

01:47:26.512 --> 01:47:27.998
Those guys are sitting ducks.

01:47:28.148 --> 01:47:32.137
- I don't wanna get dragged in the street.
- That's it. Do it.

01:47:32.587 --> 01:47:33.722
Call it in.

01:47:33.822 --> 01:47:36.023
This is Rio 2 Bravo
requesting ordnance drop.

01:47:36.123 --> 01:47:41.029
- Grid number 04837959.
- <i>That target location is your position.</i>

01:47:41.129 --> 01:47:43.899
I know my fucking position!
They're right on top of us. Just drop it!

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:46.417
Viper 34, move to final attack heading.

01:47:46.995 --> 01:47:50.509
Viper 34. Roger. 30 seconds out.

01:48:01.381 --> 01:48:03.135
<i>Hello?</i>

01:48:04.585 --> 01:48:05.954
Baby?

01:48:06.054 --> 01:48:10.782
<i>Chris? Baby, I ca...
baby, I can't hear you. Hello?</i>

01:48:11.359 --> 01:48:13.378
I'm ready.

01:48:13.928 --> 01:48:17.350
- I'm ready to come home.
- <i>What?</i>

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:22.186
I have the building in sight.

01:48:24.058 --> 01:48:26.123
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:48:28.126 --> 01:48:30.095
I'm ready to come home, baby.

01:48:31.002 --> 01:48:32.265
Chris?

01:48:35.315 --> 01:48:38.386
It's pretty bad air up here.
I can't hold this much longer.

01:48:38.486 --> 01:48:40.105
Tell the pilot "turn it loose."

01:48:40.255 --> 01:48:42.770
<i>Viper 34. Fire away.</i>

01:48:47.396 --> 01:48:48.380
<i>Target missed.</i>

01:48:51.733 --> 01:48:53.626
Shit.

01:48:54.535 --> 01:48:58.355
We need to exfil now!
Let's go! Let's move!

01:49:02.945 --> 01:49:04.870
We gotta move!

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.842
<i>Echo 7 kilo,
green-side is clear for exit.</i>

01:49:19.426 --> 01:49:22.383
I got the out. Green-side pole on my go!

01:49:24.933 --> 01:49:27.036
They're on the roof.

01:49:27.335 --> 01:49:28.463
Let's go!

01:49:47.156 --> 01:49:48.511
Last man!

01:50:07.777 --> 01:50:09.341
Get to the back!

01:50:21.191 --> 01:50:22.725
Go! Go! Go!

01:50:22.825 --> 01:50:24.360
Come on! Inside, inside!

01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:27.011
Get in the truck!
Get in the truck now! We got to go!

01:50:40.075 --> 01:50:42.245
Come on! We got to get out now!

01:50:42.345 --> 01:50:44.097
Let me up.

01:50:44.247 --> 01:50:46.800
Come on, let me up. Come on.

01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:50.387
Where's Chris?

01:50:50.487 --> 01:50:52.726
He was just behind me.
Where is Chris, man?

01:50:55.124 --> 01:50:56.476
Open the fucking door.

01:51:01.231 --> 01:51:02.463
Stop the goddamn rig!

01:51:06.001 --> 01:51:07.537
Where is he?! Chris!

01:51:07.637 --> 01:51:08.949
Chris, come on!

01:51:09.572 --> 01:51:12.444
- Come on!
- Hold the fucking vehicle, man!

01:51:12.544 --> 01:51:16.296
We can't leave you! Come on, Chris!
Grab my hand! Come on, Chris!

01:51:17.046 --> 01:51:18.398
Pull him in now!

01:51:22.959 --> 01:51:24.972
Come on, Chris!

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.596
- Yeah?
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:52:37.696 --> 01:52:41.583
I just... I got this weird message
that you were on a plane or something?

01:52:41.933 --> 01:52:44.435
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I got out early.</i>

01:52:44.535 --> 01:52:46.605
You did?

01:52:46.705 --> 01:52:48.807
So, what, are you in Germany,
or... where?

01:52:48.907 --> 01:52:51.512
No, I'm here. I'm...

01:52:53.344 --> 01:52:54.862
I'm stateside.

01:52:55.812 --> 01:52:57.766
You're home?

01:52:58.416 --> 01:53:00.969
What... what are you doing?

01:53:04.989 --> 01:53:07.843
I guess I just needed a minute.

01:53:09.793 --> 01:53:15.426
Chris, the... the kids are dying
to see you. It's been nine months.

01:53:22.907 --> 01:53:25.343
I'm coming home.

01:53:25.443 --> 01:53:27.661
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:53:27.911 --> 01:53:30.006
Yeah, I'm good.

01:53:33.053 --> 01:53:35.831
Babe, come home. Okay?

01:53:35.931 --> 01:53:38.722
You know, we... we miss you.

01:53:41.694 --> 01:53:43.820
Okay.

01:54:23.875 --> 01:54:25.055
Hey, Chris?

01:54:25.705 --> 01:54:27.605
Babe.

01:54:34.379 --> 01:54:37.102
Hon, I'm... I'm going outside.

01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:46.676
- Get it.
- Higher.

01:54:47.326 --> 01:54:50.974
Look at you. I can see
your face again, babe. Looks good.

01:54:51.225 --> 01:54:53.717
- Oh, good.
- Looks different.

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.017
So the game's this Saturday.

01:54:57.117 --> 01:55:01.007
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team.
Doctor said he could be 6'4".

01:55:01.107 --> 01:55:03.092
Isn't that insane?

01:55:03.937 --> 01:55:05.848
I can't wait for you to see him play.
I go so crazy, though,

01:55:05.948 --> 01:55:08.381
when the other kids jump on him.
Like, I need you there as, like, a leveler,

01:55:08.481 --> 01:55:10.478
you know what I mean?

01:55:11.018 --> 01:55:13.969
Hey, maybe you could
even coach, you know?

01:55:16.489 --> 01:55:19.092
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth,
and I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it,

01:55:19.192 --> 01:55:23.530
like, in her sleep or something. And she said
she'd let you pull it, but only you.

01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:25.449
Would you do that?

01:55:42.882 --> 01:55:44.292
Chris!

01:55:58.966 --> 01:56:02.253
I got a very interesting phone call.
It's from your wife.

01:56:02.603 --> 01:56:04.621
She told me about the barbecue.

01:56:06.272 --> 01:56:08.008
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah.

01:56:08.108 --> 01:56:10.145
Things seem like
they got a little out of hand.

01:56:10.245 --> 01:56:12.980
- Are you worried?
- No, sir.

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.468
So you're not worried about what happened,
or what might happen?

01:56:16.618 --> 01:56:18.644
No, sir, I'm not worried about that.

01:56:20.287 --> 01:56:22.590
Let me ask you a question, Chris.

01:56:22.690 --> 01:56:25.529
How much time did you spend in-country?

01:56:25.629 --> 01:56:29.864
- Well, four tours, so...
- That's like, what, 1,000 days?

01:56:29.964 --> 01:56:32.116
Yeah, sounds about right.

01:56:32.466 --> 01:56:34.058
Would you be surprised if I told you

01:56:34.158 --> 01:56:39.276
that the Navy has credited you
with over 160 kills?

01:56:40.373 --> 01:56:42.487
Do you ever think that...

01:56:42.587 --> 01:56:47.063
you might have seen things or done some
things over there that you wish you hadn't?

01:56:47.313 --> 01:56:49.666
Oh, that's not me. No.

01:56:50.316 --> 01:56:52.719
- What's not you?
- I was just protecting my guys.

01:56:52.819 --> 01:56:55.536
They were trying to kill
our soldiers, and...

01:56:55.636 --> 01:56:59.802
I'm willing to meet my creator
and answer for every shot that I took.

01:57:02.396 --> 01:57:04.752
The thing that...

01:57:05.099 --> 01:57:08.320
haunts me are all the guys
that I couldn't save.

01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:14.348
You know, I'm willing and able to be there,
but I'm not. I'm here. I quit.

01:57:16.143 --> 01:57:18.146
So you wish
you could've saved more guys?

01:57:19.581 --> 01:57:20.967
Yes, sir.

01:57:22.617 --> 01:57:26.154
You know, you can walk down
any hall in this hospital.

01:57:26.254 --> 01:57:28.610
We got plenty of soldiers need saving.

01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:36.098
Wanna take a walk?

01:57:36.198 --> 01:57:37.910
Sure.

01:57:38.199 --> 01:57:41.541
All right. I wanna show you something.

01:57:44.439 --> 01:57:45.661
I still smoke.

01:57:45.761 --> 01:57:49.678
Can't be too mad at it
'cause it kinda saved my right hand.

01:57:49.778 --> 01:57:51.412
How so?

01:57:51.512 --> 01:57:55.650
When I got blown up, I had both of my hands
on the bottom of the steering wheel.

01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:59.021
And right before the explosion went off,
I took my hand off,

01:57:59.121 --> 01:58:01.450
grabbed a cigarette,
stuck it in my mouth.

01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:04.830
And when I went to go light it,
the explosion happened.

01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:08.830
And it took the whole bottom of the steering
wheel and my left hand off.

01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:13.953
And I was lucky that I had this. I mean,
it still fucked up my right hand, but...

01:58:14.053 --> 01:58:15.471
- Yeah.
- ...I still got it.

01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:18.824
- And you still smoke?
- Yeah, I still smoke.

01:58:25.747 --> 01:58:30.203
Miss. Three inches to the right.
Come on, Wynn. You can do better than that.

01:58:31.353 --> 01:58:33.807
Bring this to the right.

01:58:33.957 --> 01:58:37.492
Make sure you keep both eyes open.
Let that trigger surprise you.

01:58:37.592 --> 01:58:40.028
We're not shooting bad guys.
We're shooting paper.

01:58:40.128 --> 01:58:42.130
How about The Legend
stops trying to fuck up my shot?

01:58:42.230 --> 01:58:43.648
- How about that?
- How about you hit one?

01:58:45.735 --> 01:58:46.741
- Hit!
- There you go.

01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:52.424
Bull's eye, boy. Damn, if that
don't feel like I got my balls back.

01:58:53.374 --> 01:58:55.844
Why you spending
all this time with us, man?

01:58:55.944 --> 01:58:57.613
I know you got a family.

01:58:57.713 --> 01:59:00.316
I heard you had a boot collection
before the war?

01:59:00.416 --> 01:59:02.625
So I was thinking,
I saw we were about the same size.

01:59:03.352 --> 01:59:06.658
Seriously, man. Why do you do it?

01:59:06.758 --> 01:59:09.357
Well, we take care of each other, right?

01:59:09.457 --> 01:59:12.144
Let's see if you can't hit two in a row.

01:59:13.163 --> 01:59:15.030
Come on, man. You got this.

01:59:16.566 --> 01:59:18.221
- Hit!
- Nice.

01:59:23.071 --> 01:59:25.615
- Hit!
- Goddamn.

01:59:26.442 --> 01:59:27.861
Who's the legend now?

01:59:29.477 --> 01:59:33.031
That's a title you don't want. Trust me.

01:59:37.936 --> 01:59:39.834
Yo, will you hop down?
I'll give 'em to you.

01:59:43.426 --> 01:59:45.980
- You add one more?
- Yeah.

01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:49.305
- All right, take 'em inside.
- All right.

02:00:11.755 --> 02:00:13.403
Come here.

02:00:16.827 --> 02:00:18.928
It's not a bad life out here, is it?

02:00:19.028 --> 02:00:21.331
Got a smile on his face.

02:00:21.431 --> 02:00:23.850
Looks cheery to me.

02:00:24.067 --> 02:00:26.520
Just doing his thing.

02:00:28.505 --> 02:00:30.858
Wave goodbye to him.

02:00:39.749 --> 02:00:42.118
Oh! Fuck, who is that?!

02:00:42.218 --> 02:00:44.889
- Oh! Babe, is that you?
- Yep-A-Doo-Dee!

02:00:44.989 --> 02:00:47.452
- Baby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit.
- What?

02:00:47.552 --> 02:00:51.095
No, I'm all right. I'm all right!
I'm all right. Fuck.

02:00:51.195 --> 02:00:52.597
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

02:00:52.697 --> 02:00:55.280
What happened? Don't...

02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:01.123
You know that it's a heck of a thing
to stop a beating heart.

02:01:01.473 --> 02:01:02.719
Yeah.

02:01:02.819 --> 02:01:06.009
That's why we're gonna do it together
for your first time.

02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:07.894
All right.

02:01:08.244 --> 02:01:10.615
Now, remember, you gotta be calm...

02:01:10.715 --> 02:01:12.651
confident...

02:01:12.751 --> 02:01:15.111
and you never hesitate.

02:01:16.353 --> 02:01:18.489
- All right.
- You got it, bubba?

02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:20.159
- I got it.
- You feel good?

02:01:20.259 --> 02:01:22.313
Yeah.

02:01:37.542 --> 02:01:39.394
Hands in the air, little lady.

02:01:40.004 --> 02:01:41.929
Hands in the air.

02:01:42.779 --> 02:01:44.665
Now, you drop them drawers.

02:01:46.317 --> 02:01:49.536
But you drop 'em nice and easy.

02:01:50.559 --> 02:01:52.624
Oh, baby, look at you.

02:01:52.724 --> 02:01:55.509
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

02:01:55.959 --> 02:01:57.688
Can I tell you something?

02:01:57.788 --> 02:02:00.699
- Tell it to the judge.
- Stop it.

02:02:00.799 --> 02:02:04.034
No. I am so proud of you,
and I don't tell you enough.

02:02:04.134 --> 02:02:06.939
I'm so proud of you.
And you're such a great father.

02:02:07.039 --> 02:02:10.526
And I am so happy
that I've got my husband back.

02:02:11.576 --> 02:02:14.392
And I also know how hard
you fought to get here.

02:02:15.714 --> 02:02:18.397
You're worth fighting for.

02:02:19.585 --> 02:02:23.072
Now tell me one other thing.
Did you... did you pleat those jeans?

02:02:23.222 --> 02:02:25.557
Yes, ma'am. I believe
they're right down the middle.

02:02:25.657 --> 02:02:27.760
Oh, you're just a regular
old cowboy again.

02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:30.462
That's right. Now, why don't you...
why don't you really drop them drawers?

02:02:30.562 --> 02:02:33.332
I'm not wearing any drawers, baby.

02:02:33.432 --> 02:02:35.716
I got four minutes.

02:02:36.206 --> 02:02:37.353
Is that all it takes?

02:02:37.453 --> 02:02:41.856
No, it takes two minutes. But then again
I want two minutes to look at you.

02:02:42.309 --> 02:02:45.010
Aren't you going to the range?

02:02:45.110 --> 02:02:46.879
Who are you taking out?

02:02:46.979 --> 02:02:49.781
This marine. His mama kept asking me.

02:02:49.881 --> 02:02:53.017
She parks cars at the elementary school,
and she said, "can you help out my son?"

02:02:53.117 --> 02:02:56.354
And I just thought... today's the only day
I can really do it, so...

02:02:56.454 --> 02:02:58.790
It's gonna be just a little bit
of the afternoon. I'll be back.

02:02:58.890 --> 02:03:00.632
Yes!

02:03:01.459 --> 02:03:02.761
- You make sure you keep them drawers...
- Daddy.

02:03:02.861 --> 02:03:05.263
- What's up? What's up?
- Dad, you wanna play Skylanders?

02:03:05.363 --> 02:03:08.301
No, I can't play right now.
I'll do it when I get back, boy.

02:03:08.401 --> 02:03:10.370
But, see, you're on level 8,
and that doesn't work.

02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:13.772
I gotta be on level 4. And I don't want...
I wanna win. You gotta let me win.

02:03:13.872 --> 02:03:14.873
No way!

02:03:14.973 --> 02:03:16.909
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?

02:03:17.009 --> 02:03:18.790
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?!

02:03:19.110 --> 02:03:20.804
Poke the bear!

02:03:21.214 --> 02:03:23.504
No! You're supposed to roar, like...

02:03:23.884 --> 02:03:27.334
Like what? Like a beast, right?
Like what?

02:03:33.227 --> 02:03:36.349
All right, bubba.
Y'all look after our women, okay?

02:03:36.449 --> 02:03:38.965
- Yeah.
- Okay. It's a big responsibility.

02:03:39.065 --> 02:03:40.917
You up for it?

02:03:41.935 --> 02:03:43.437
All right. See you later, baby.

02:03:43.537 --> 02:03:46.160
- I love you.
- I love you back.

02:03:52.110 --> 02:03:53.858
- How are you? You good?
- Good.

02:03:53.958 --> 02:03:56.582
We're gonna go about a two-hour drive
and shoot some guns

02:03:56.682 --> 02:03:58.662
and maybe have a little conversation
along the way. What you say?

02:03:58.762 --> 02:04:00.871
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

02:04:01.721 --> 02:04:02.704
- Thank you.
- Yep.

02:04:03.533 --> 02:04:07.116
Hey, you eat yet? You hungry?
You wanna get something on the way?

02:04:08.305 --> 02:04:14.398
