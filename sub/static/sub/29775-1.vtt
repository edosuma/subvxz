01:31.000 --> 01:32.583
Day of finals.

01:32.667 --> 01:35.500
Here we are,
it's 7:30 in the morning,

01:35.583 --> 01:38.166
just getting our last touches.

01:39.041 --> 01:42.083
Gonna hit the can gap,
make my way down,

01:42.166 --> 01:44.083
and, uh, see...

01:44.166 --> 01:45.834
see how I feel this morning.
It's pretty early,

01:45.917 --> 01:48.250
but I feel pretty confident.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.166
Think of all
the Rampages I've done,

01:50.250 --> 01:53.542
I feel more comfortable
this year than I ever have.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.709
I was very much in love.

02:12.542 --> 02:14.625
We had Natalie.
She was almost two.

02:14.709 --> 02:16.917
She was beautiful and healthy,

02:18.041 --> 02:19.792
and I was pregnant again.

02:23.709 --> 02:27.625
I was so excited.
I had such a great summer playing basketball.

02:27.709 --> 02:30.542
I felt like I was
at the top of my game.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.667
I was just another girl living life in LA

02:33.750 --> 02:35.917
with my daughter,
trying to make ends meet,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.208
going from school,
picking her up.

02:43.291 --> 02:44.834
I had graduated school

02:44.917 --> 02:48.333
and was getting ready to do
music and jewelry and ski,

02:48.417 --> 02:51.041
and I thought, well,
I'll take one last trip.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.667
My doctor happened to be out of town.

02:55.750 --> 02:58.083
I had other things
happen at the hospital,

02:58.166 --> 03:00.250
but basically,
I went in to have Anna.

03:08.709 --> 03:12.417
Usually, I surf alone,
but that day, I told my friends

03:12.500 --> 03:14.291
to come meet me at the beach.

03:18.125 --> 03:22.000
We ordered pizza,
had dinner.

03:23.875 --> 03:27.542
I just wanna warm it up to this drop in right here,
you know?

03:27.625 --> 03:30.709
I was in the car with...

03:30.792 --> 03:32.000
the love of my life.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.417
Wish me luck.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.792
There was scaffolding up in front of the house.

03:36.875 --> 03:39.291
They were like, we go
up on the scaffolding.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.583
It's a really pretty view.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.000
Bike good?

03:46.083 --> 03:48.208
Who wouldn't want to go to look
at the pretty city lights?

03:50.500 --> 03:54.083
One o'clock in the afternoon, bright,
sunny day, big intersection.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.667
I wasn't going very fast.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.458
Whoa!

04:04.542 --> 04:06.333
We were playing horseshoes up on the beach,

04:06.417 --> 04:09.125
and it got hot, so I was like...

04:09.208 --> 04:11.375
I wanna jump off the boat
and jump in the water.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.333
Oh yeah, people
dive off that rock!

04:16.250 --> 04:18.125
- Yeah!
- Jump!

04:18.208 --> 04:19.916
A defender came in front of me.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
My legs got taken out
from underneath me.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.125
I laid the ball up,
fell on my back,

04:24.208 --> 04:25.875
and made the layup,
which was great

04:25.959 --> 04:27.959
'cause that would've
made my story kinda lame.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.250
This is 29-year-old Paul Basagoitia.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.834
This guy is such a legend in the sport.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.750
He's done so much
in the slopestyle world.

04:33.834 --> 04:37.250
The first guy to ever win back-to-back Crankworx Slopestyle titles,

04:37.333 --> 04:38.917
and he's got
a very unique line.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.917
Nobody's riding this far rider's right except for Paul Bas.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.667
Three, two, one...

04:48.208 --> 04:50.959
Pulled inside of the barrel,
when I came out,

04:51.041 --> 04:53.291
the wave hit me
in my back, and...

04:53.375 --> 04:54.959
I thought it was
deeper than it was.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.458
I remember taking off my seat belt,

04:56.542 --> 04:58.250
turning around to get
something from the trunk,

04:58.333 --> 05:00.458
when I saw him cutting the wheel back and forth.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.500
Hit a lip too far back and it flipped me

05:02.583 --> 05:04.333
into almost like a backflip.

05:07.208 --> 05:09.834
I was walking and a tree just fell on me.

05:09.917 --> 05:11.375
I was holding onto my mom's hand,

05:11.458 --> 05:12.750
but the force knocked me down.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.709
The tire went
completely over me.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.792
She put the wrong
chemical in the epidural.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.291
- It burned my spinal cord.
- And that's when we launched off the overpass.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.500
I dove off the back of the boat
and hit the bottom of the river.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.667
I fell out the window
and hit the ground 30 feet.

05:29.583 --> 05:32.166
Shit!

05:36.041 --> 05:38.375
Aah, fuck!

05:38.458 --> 05:42.500
Holy smokes!
Paul, just inches off of his line,

05:42.583 --> 05:45.125
causing him to come
down into the bushes.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.959
I can't move feet-- move my feet!

05:47.041 --> 05:48.875
Hang on,
we got medical here, hold on.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.792
Hold on. Breathe.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.250
Okay, talk to me.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.333
- I can't move my feet!
- Hold on, hold on.

05:54.417 --> 05:57.500
Don't move, don't move.
Watch that...

05:57.583 --> 05:58.750
Watch that right arm.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.792
I'm here, baby.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.542
Okay.
We're gonna roll you over, Paul.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.792
Be strong, babe.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.625
- You got it.
- We got you, Paul.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.917
- Should we strap his neck?
- Ready? On three.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.083
- Ready? One, two, three.
- Oh, that hurts.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.250
- Take him out. Take him out. Take him out.
- You're okay, babe.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.417
Nice and easy,
nice and easy, nice and easy, good.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.458
We've got this nasty burst fracture,

07:15.542 --> 07:19.125
obliterated T12 with a large
fragment back into his canal.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.417
His cord is just trapped,

07:20.500 --> 07:23.417
and all the ligaments
back here are all torn.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.667
Is he moving anything?

07:24.750 --> 07:26.083
It's an incomplete injury,

07:26.166 --> 07:28.750
so he's got some movement
in his proximal legs.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.792
The distal legs,
he doesn't have any movement.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.083
He's got some sensation.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.667
Wanna take this bone out
and just do a corpectomy?

07:34.750 --> 07:36.041
We could take
that down,

07:36.125 --> 07:38.375
evacuate the blood,
get you to where you need to be,

07:38.458 --> 07:39.792
leave a drain
in afterwards.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.291
I'll just put
a cage in there,

07:41.375 --> 07:44.583
and lock him in
posteriorly as well.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.959
I guess I knew that I couldn't move, but...

07:47.041 --> 07:49.208
I didn't know...

07:50.041 --> 07:52.792
that I had a spinal cord injury.
I had no idea what...

07:53.375 --> 07:56.583
a spinal cord injury
entailed or the...

07:56.667 --> 07:58.917
things that would come
with my life after that.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.709
They had told my family
and my boyfriend at the time

08:02.792 --> 08:05.959
that I was never gonna walk again,
but no one had told me yet.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.625
I don't know why no one
told me. I don't know.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.875
I guess it's really hard
to tell someone that.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.125
First thing that you hear
when you open your eyes

08:12.208 --> 08:14.166
after a spinal
cord injury is,

08:14.250 --> 08:16.500
"You're never
gonna walk again."

08:17.333 --> 08:19.500
And I was just like, fuck you.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.792
What do you mean
I'm never gonna walk again?

08:21.875 --> 08:23.834
Like, "Well, we're not
gonna say never,

08:23.917 --> 08:26.500
"but your five percent chance
is pretty slim,

08:26.583 --> 08:29.709
"and at the five percent chance,
it's not going to be

08:29.792 --> 08:32.250
the same way that
you walked before."

08:32.332 --> 08:34.917
I just kind of woke up and...

08:35.000 --> 08:37.582
was in my new body.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.500
Nichole,
so we just finished up the surgery.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.250
From here on out,
it's gonna be a rough road.

08:45.333 --> 08:49.291
He'll have some problems with
bowel and bladder function,

08:49.375 --> 08:50.750
sexual function.

08:50.834 --> 08:55.041
There is a solid chance that
he's not gonna walk again.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.875
Day four.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.959
Really tough.

09:23.709 --> 09:26.750
Never in a million years
thought I'd be here, but...

09:27.333 --> 09:29.625
if it wasn't for you guys,

09:29.709 --> 09:31.583
I wouldn't be...

09:31.667 --> 09:33.166
trying how I am right now.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.125
You guys have been
a huge support.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.375
- Use your legs as best you can.
- Just stand, baby,

09:37.458 --> 09:39.041
- you got it.
- One, two, three.

09:39.125 --> 09:42.291
Stand, stand, stand.
Push, push, push.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.500
Want to see if I'm stable?

09:44.583 --> 09:47.750
- Yeah, it's okay.
- I've got his left side here, Mike.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.500
You're okay, babe. Push.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.166
Okay, nice. Now, we're sitting.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.792
Perfect.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.125
And here we go.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.792
Breaking my back I thought was similar to breaking your arm,

10:16.875 --> 10:17.959
spraining an ankle.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.083
You put a cast on it,
you get better.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.125
I didn't understand that
neck meant quadriplegic.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.750
I didn't understand that
back meant paraplegic.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.792
I thought the people
that were in wheelchairs

10:28.875 --> 10:30.000
were born like that.

10:30.083 --> 10:33.208
I had no idea that you
could become paralyzed.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.667
I had gotten an iPad,
and I remember looking it up

10:35.750 --> 10:39.959
and just pulling up a chart where it
literally tells you your whole entire spine

10:40.041 --> 10:42.834
and then seeing paraplegia,
this is what it is.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.542
This is the spinal cord chart,
and that's about it.

10:54.041 --> 10:56.333
It's gonna get better, babe.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.917
Just wanna lock bands,
get these legs moving, and just...

11:01.000 --> 11:03.875
help people in the future
with, you know,

11:03.959 --> 11:06.875
the same situation,
and hopefully I can...

11:06.959 --> 11:09.750
be the guidance
for someone else.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.041
When you see somebody
in a wheelchair in public,

11:18.125 --> 11:23.291
you just see them struggle getting from point A to point B.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.709
The real struggle is

11:27.792 --> 11:30.583
what goes on behind
closed doors.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.583
When they started
telling me more about

11:33.667 --> 11:35.625
the injury
and what it really meant

11:35.709 --> 11:39.792
to be paralyzed,
and not to be able to feel your body,

11:39.875 --> 11:42.250
not being able to use
the restroom by yourself,

11:42.625 --> 11:44.208
it's everybody's
worst nightmare.

11:44.291 --> 11:45.583
It's 3:00 in the morning,

11:45.667 --> 11:48.542
and, uh, this is what
I have to go through.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.792
Ten o'clock at night,
12 o'clock at night,

11:50.875 --> 11:54.250
three o'clock in the morning,
six o'clock in the morning.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.709
Not a good time.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.667
I hated my fiancée seeing me.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.208
I think the first
thing I said to her--

12:51.291 --> 12:53.542
'cause we were due
to get married in April,

12:53.625 --> 12:55.583
and I was hurt in September,

12:55.667 --> 12:57.875
and I remember when
she got to the hospital,

12:57.959 --> 13:00.458
I remember just laying
there. I couldn't...

13:00.542 --> 13:02.959
really grab her hand
or anything, and...

13:03.625 --> 13:06.000
I remember saying to her,
"You're not marrying me."

13:06.083 --> 13:08.125
Like, "You're not
marrying a vegetable."

13:09.625 --> 13:12.208
My girlfriend's been sleeping in that corner

13:12.291 --> 13:15.041
on that bed for
the last two weeks.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.083
It kills me.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.000
I went from being a hotshot tank commander

13:33.083 --> 13:35.917
to being like
an overgrown baby.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.709
I had to get my ass wiped
for me. I had to get bathed.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.375
I had to get clothed.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.333
I can't even--
Humbling isn't even a word.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.041
It was, it was, uh...

13:47.000 --> 13:50.542
I wanted to die. I had-- I felt like,
why am I living?

13:50.625 --> 13:54.917
If I can't be the same person that I was before,
why am I still here?

13:55.041 --> 13:58.625
I wanted them to like do something to just...
end my life.

13:58.709 --> 14:02.667
I just couldn't-- I didn't see how I could continue living like that,

14:02.750 --> 14:04.750
or like this.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.792
Today felt like it was
the very first day that...

14:12.917 --> 14:14.709
reality actually set in.

14:14.792 --> 14:18.417
I'll never be back
on my bike or walking.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.208
There were a lot of little

14:48.291 --> 14:50.291
boxes that they put us in.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.333
Time frames,
what to expect when.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.083
Six months, really great.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.917
Twelve months, definitely
getting some stuff back.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.500
Eighteen months to two years,
you're maxing out.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.000
They told me that I would make

15:01.083 --> 15:02.875
my most progress
within two years.

15:02.959 --> 15:07.792
Right away, it was in this gym,
was working towards being...

15:08.333 --> 15:11.917
not necessarily out of
the wheelchair, just being...

15:12.000 --> 15:15.166
the best I could be
in this situation.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.709
- Want some music?
- Maybe.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.083
Use all the power have, babe. You can do it.

15:22.166 --> 15:25.083
And then just as you come up,
just keep bringing

15:25.166 --> 15:27.542
your hips forward
and your chest up.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.750
And the hips kind of
follow the chest.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.166
Just up
and forward.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.041
You got it,
you got. Use those legs.

15:39.083 --> 15:43.458
As you feel,
start walking, hands forward.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.333
This is him.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.959
- He's got it.
- Nice job, babe.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.041
Good. Good!

15:55.667 --> 15:57.458
Two wheels was my life.

16:06.667 --> 16:10.291
Started riding a bike without training wheels when I was two years old.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.083
My dad would just
give me one good push,

16:12.166 --> 16:15.917
and I was able
to maintain that speed.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.667
I remember going
into the bike shop

16:17.750 --> 16:22.375
with my mom and purchasing
my first BMX racing bike.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.625
Getting out of school,
the first thing I would do

16:24.709 --> 16:26.542
is go to this vacant lot.

16:26.625 --> 16:29.709
All the teenagers would go
out there and build jumps.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.875
That's all I wanted to do.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.792
I wanted to compete,
and I wanted to race.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.583
Basagoitia moving to the front!

16:37.667 --> 16:41.625
The Flash dropping one in the first turn!
Hasslegrave going down!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.667
I loved training,

16:43.750 --> 16:47.375
working hard,
and getting the results.

16:47.458 --> 16:51.959
I was the best in my age group
in the world, at 10 years old.

16:53.917 --> 16:56.709
Today was a huge
accomplishment for me.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.750
It was the first day

16:58.834 --> 17:01.000
that I got out of bed by myself.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.166
Super emotional about it because

17:03.250 --> 17:06.750
every morning, that's like
the hardest thing for me is to,

17:06.834 --> 17:09.165
you know,
get out of bed because,

17:09.250 --> 17:11.000
you know, the night before,
you're always dreaming

17:11.083 --> 17:13.625
about riding and hanging out
with your friends,

17:13.709 --> 17:16.625
living a normal life,
and then you wake up.

17:17.208 --> 17:19.375
Reality sets in.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.165
I get choked up
even thinking about it, so...

17:22.250 --> 17:25.583
I'm gonna keep
plugging away and do my best.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.208
You wanna keep your elbows in.

17:35.291 --> 17:36.959
We're gonna take you in backwards here,

17:37.041 --> 17:39.000
so in the first row.

17:41.166 --> 17:42.542
Whoa!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.125
- Don't be alarmed.
- Okay.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.709
Yeah, you're good.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.667
If I could've gone home

17:47.750 --> 17:49.625
right away, I would, but...

17:49.709 --> 17:52.792
you have to do certain things to be able to get ready for that.

17:53.417 --> 17:55.375
It blew my mind.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.875
I went from being so independent

17:58.959 --> 18:01.375
to just starting all over again,

18:01.458 --> 18:04.250
to the days that I don't
even remember, as an infant.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.333
- Grab your... and meet you on the other side.
- Okay.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.125
Coming down.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.667
I went to my rehab
hospital and I said,

18:14.750 --> 18:18.667
how many people have walked out of your hospital?

18:18.750 --> 18:21.125
He said not many. And I said,
well, add me to that list

18:21.208 --> 18:23.458
'cause I'm not leaving
here till I walk again.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.208
First day at Craig.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.875
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.750
- Are you?
- I'm, um...

18:31.834 --> 18:34.083
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm excited.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.208
I'm hoping to see some progress

18:36.291 --> 18:38.417
and maybe walk
out of this place.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.750
All right, let me see what
you can do with this foot.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.083
Okay.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.875
Where do you feel that?
Okay.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.709
The team that was working with me told me

19:02.792 --> 19:05.333
they can't tell me what
my life is gonna be like

19:05.417 --> 19:08.208
because every spinal cord
injury is so different.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.959
Some people do have some movement.
Some people don't have movement.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.750
Some people have sensation,
some people don't.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.291
Once I heard that there was

19:19.375 --> 19:21.750
no two spinal cord
injuries alike,

19:21.834 --> 19:23.875
and that you shouldn't
compare yourself...

19:27.500 --> 19:29.583
Everybody's a snowflake.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.792
Every individual
and their injury

19:33.875 --> 19:38.125
is different and acts
and reacts differently.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.667
So, there's no way
for any one person to understand

19:40.750 --> 19:45.208
how another person
is experiencing this injury.

19:47.041 --> 19:52.041
There's not one person here at the hospital
that's not in a wheelchair, and, uh...

19:52.125 --> 19:56.417
matter of fact,
there's people here a lot worse than I am.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.500
And it's, um, quite scary,
you know?

19:59.583 --> 20:02.750
Everybody is literally here...

20:04.333 --> 20:06.375
for the same reason, and...

20:07.333 --> 20:09.834
and in this case, it's...

20:09.917 --> 20:12.166
you know,
because you're paralyzed.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.709
They were having me do a lot of things

20:24.792 --> 20:26.583
to work in the wheelchair.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.250
And I was like, no,
I just wanna walk.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.208
I only want to be doing
therapy for my legs.

20:30.291 --> 20:31.542
I don't want to transfer.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.083
I don't want you to tell me
in a wheelchair.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.875
I have to go to the refrigerator
and take out a dozen eggs.

20:35.959 --> 20:39.667
I was getting so...
frustrated by them, like,

20:39.750 --> 20:43.166
we want to teach you how to diaper your baby at the wheelchair--

20:43.250 --> 20:45.166
like, it was always
the wheelchair level.

20:53.291 --> 20:56.500
They would tell me to get
out of my chair and get on the floor,

20:56.583 --> 20:57.917
and then get back into my chair.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.583
This is how you're
gonna put on your pants.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.166
This is how you're
gonna get in the shower.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.875
And I feel like I still needed
time to process things...

21:06.583 --> 21:08.834
...and grieve a little bit.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.291
Paul,
it's your mom. I'm just calling

21:36.375 --> 21:38.959
'cause I heard the bad news.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.875
Have Nichole give me a call,

21:40.959 --> 21:44.083
and let me know how
you're doing, please.

21:44.166 --> 21:45.834
Bye.

21:45.917 --> 21:47.917
I haven't spoken to my mom in years.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.458
We don't see
eye to eye on things,

21:49.542 --> 21:52.291
and when I get back home,
we can try to fix things,

21:52.375 --> 21:54.875
but right now,
it's not the time.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.792
Growing up wasn't easy.

21:58.875 --> 22:01.500
In 1995, my parents
bought this motel.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.792
Pretty beat up, the roof
was about to fall off,

22:04.875 --> 22:06.625
but it was their dream.

22:06.709 --> 22:09.375
My mom would take me
all around the US

22:09.458 --> 22:11.625
while my dad was
at home working,

22:11.709 --> 22:14.709
and raising enough money
for us to do these races.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.417
My mom pushed me to the max.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.875
I would do four to five races
every week.

22:20.959 --> 22:22.500
The days I wasn't
doing so well,

22:22.583 --> 22:24.625
she would yell at me,
scream at me.

22:24.709 --> 22:27.709
As a child,
you don't want to hear that from your own mother.

22:27.792 --> 22:31.750
But she always wanted me
to be the best.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.875
Every time we would come back
from the races,

22:33.959 --> 22:37.375
my dad was drunk,
my mom was upset.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.750
Once my parents got divorced,

22:39.834 --> 22:41.917
everything just stopped.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.667
My mom ended up
taking over the hotel.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.083
My dad was like,
all I want is one room

22:47.166 --> 22:49.917
until I'm able to figure out
my shit again.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.333
He worked so hard
to get that hotel

22:53.417 --> 22:55.917
and help me with my BMX career.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.500
Told my dad, I'm like, hey,
I'm gonna be next to you

22:58.583 --> 23:01.125
whether the situation
is good or bad.

23:01.875 --> 23:04.166
We lived together in room 120

23:04.250 --> 23:06.458
for a good three years.

23:09.458 --> 23:12.166
Hi, brother!

23:22.750 --> 23:24.792
Just make sure the brakes are on.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.208
- Got your brakes on?
- Yeah.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.083
Okay.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.458
- Thanks for dinner, it was good.
- All right.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.458
Yeah,
I'll see you tomorrow, buddy.

23:35.542 --> 23:37.083
Watch it out,
it's ice.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.500
Okay.

23:41.333 --> 23:44.583
Dude, I've never,
ever seen my dad cry.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.166
Never once in my life.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.917
My mom says he's been crying all week for you.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.750
Yeah.
That was tough.

23:51.834 --> 23:55.000
- You're okay.
- I know. I'm just saying it was tough.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.375
Like, 'cause you know, like...

24:01.041 --> 24:04.542
I don't know.
You just know it's serious when he's crying, you know?

24:05.333 --> 24:07.125
My dad's been through
a lot of shit--

24:07.208 --> 24:10.083
I know,
but this is the first time he's seen anything for you.

24:10.166 --> 24:13.792
I know.
I just know right when he saw me the first time in the wheelchair,

24:13.875 --> 24:16.750
- he was devastated-- For sure. He was...
- Cried a little.

24:17.208 --> 24:19.417
And that's why it took him
so long to come visit me

24:19.500 --> 24:22.250
because he didn't wanna see
me in a wheelchair, you know?

24:22.333 --> 24:23.959
Or in this situation.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.667
Baby...

24:26.458 --> 24:29.083
- Toughen up.
- I know. I'm just saying...

24:29.583 --> 24:32.333
- I'm tough-- No, I'm tough.
- You're gonna prove--

24:32.709 --> 24:34.834
Told you I was gonna be
emotional when I saw my dad.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.291
- But your dad--
- And I was good. I was good all day.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.458
I was fine, until he...

24:39.542 --> 24:41.709
"No, no, no. Oh..."
I don't know.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.583
- Love you so much.
- I love you, babe.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.625
Why is it everybody
other than me

24:50.709 --> 24:52.875
loves being in my wheelchair.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.500
Watch this.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.458
It's obviously easy for me to say,

24:59.542 --> 25:01.917
"Hey, let's move on," but...

25:02.041 --> 25:05.291
the reason I do act like
that is to encourage him.

25:05.375 --> 25:07.166
I wanna see what you got.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.000
If he sees that I'm happy,

25:09.083 --> 25:12.250
I'm hoping
he will try to be happy.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.792
I have to be the rock.

25:13.875 --> 25:16.083
Gosh.

25:17.375 --> 25:18.834
When you become injured

25:18.917 --> 25:21.959
or your life
changes drastically,

25:22.041 --> 25:23.917
it doesn't only
stop your life,

25:24.000 --> 25:25.917
but it stops
everyone else's around you.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.041
You realize that these people
like my fiancée Elise

25:30.125 --> 25:32.667
and friends and...

25:32.750 --> 25:34.417
um, family,

25:34.500 --> 25:36.750
they do it without even...

25:37.417 --> 25:39.166
you know, blinking an eye.

25:39.250 --> 25:42.000
This young kid from
the neighborhood came by,

25:42.083 --> 25:45.041
and he looks into the car,
he's like, you're paralyzed?

25:45.125 --> 25:48.709
I said yes, and I showed him
my handicap sign, my plaque.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.625
He's like wow,
you don't look paralyzed.

25:50.709 --> 25:53.583
So, once this young kid leaves,

25:53.667 --> 25:56.500
she's like, "Mom,
you're not paralyzed."

25:56.583 --> 25:58.542
And I was like, I don't
know where you've been,

25:58.625 --> 26:00.709
but I'm paralyzed Brianna.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.041
She's like, no, Mom.
She's like,

26:02.125 --> 26:04.291
you can move
your legs a little bit.

26:04.375 --> 26:07.250
She's like, someone who's
paralyzed can't move at all.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.375
She's like,
so I don't see you as paralyzed.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.125
So, when she said that to me,

26:12.208 --> 26:16.375
something just shifted
in my mind where no matter what

26:16.458 --> 26:19.208
I'm going through physically,
emotionally,

26:19.291 --> 26:21.083
she just sees me as Mom,

26:21.166 --> 26:23.125
as a complete person,

26:23.208 --> 26:24.583
and her love is unconditional,

26:24.667 --> 26:27.542
and that just gives me strength
to keep on moving forward.

26:27.959 --> 26:30.166
Nothing will ever
change how I feel.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.000
You're my life,

26:35.083 --> 26:36.667
and...

26:36.750 --> 26:38.792
nothing will ever change.

26:39.959 --> 26:43.333
You're my one and only,
my end all be all.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.250
This is nothing for me.

26:46.333 --> 26:49.166
This makes me love you even more because I know how much you...

26:50.166 --> 26:54.500
the strong person
that you are, and I love it.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.834
So thankful for you.

26:56.917 --> 26:59.000
Nothing had changed for him.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.917
I would've felt it. I would
feel other people's eyes on me

27:02.000 --> 27:03.417
differently than they were.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.166
You can sense it.
You know...

27:06.625 --> 27:09.041
this person loves me.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.333
My babe's leaving
me tomorrow!

27:12.417 --> 27:14.083
I don't want to, babe.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.583
Going to be very sad.

27:17.667 --> 27:20.875
No, don't talk about it.
I'm sad, too.

27:22.625 --> 27:25.417
Reality:
gotta go back to work.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.583
Talk about last night.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.166
What? No.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.375
What do you mean?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.959
What part of last night?

27:35.041 --> 27:36.583
What happened last night?

27:36.667 --> 27:38.750
Hmm...

27:39.709 --> 27:41.166
Can you give me...

27:41.250 --> 27:43.333
No.
What happened last night?

27:43.417 --> 27:46.166
- I'm not talking about that.
- What?

27:46.250 --> 27:47.500
Okay, hand me that...

27:47.583 --> 27:50.333
- Okay, you tell me what happened...
- No.

27:50.417 --> 27:53.458
...and then we'll discuss
about the Starbursts.

27:53.542 --> 27:54.500
Uh-uh.

27:54.583 --> 27:56.834
Take that towel off.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.208
If...?

28:02.500 --> 28:04.709
If what?

28:05.250 --> 28:08.250
- Two for two?
- Oh my God.

28:08.834 --> 28:13.000
Here's the three questions people
wanna ask when you're in a wheelchair:

28:13.083 --> 28:14.875
How did you get hurt?

28:14.959 --> 28:16.667
Will you ever walk again?

28:16.750 --> 28:18.208
Can you have sex?

28:18.291 --> 28:21.083
Not as easy
as it once was or as...

28:21.959 --> 28:23.834
normal or romantic

28:23.917 --> 28:26.166
or that kind of thing, you know.

28:26.250 --> 28:29.834
Being with someone and being intimate with someone involves so much,

28:29.917 --> 28:31.834
it involves so much more
than just, you know, sex.

28:31.917 --> 28:34.500
When people say that, sounds like, "Oh,
so then you can't have sex."

28:34.583 --> 28:35.834
No!

28:35.917 --> 28:37.959
That is the only part
of my life I would say is

28:38.041 --> 28:41.000
better than everything,
than it ever was before.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.709
It made me more-- less...

28:43.792 --> 28:45.709
inhibited, I guess,
less afraid,

28:45.792 --> 28:47.583
and made me understand
my body more.

28:47.667 --> 28:50.667
And so, for me, that was
the only plus I got.

28:51.583 --> 28:53.500
Sorry to put it that way.

29:03.125 --> 29:04.375
Hi, babe.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.542
You won't believe
what just happened to me.

29:06.625 --> 29:07.959
Why?

29:08.417 --> 29:09.792
Come on.

29:23.166 --> 29:24.667
Yes!

29:28.166 --> 29:30.500
Yeah. Yeah.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.667
- Woo!
- Ah!

29:34.709 --> 29:38.750
- I'm about to cry.
- Oh my God.

29:38.834 --> 29:41.250
It was the best piss I ever had in my life.

29:41.333 --> 29:43.166
I'm so happy, baby.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.333
- Love you.
- Okay, love you, too.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.834
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.250
Yeah!

30:01.500 --> 30:03.542
I'll never forget that moment.

30:03.625 --> 30:06.875
Picking up a French fry, slowly bringing it to my mouth,
and when it made it to my mouth,

30:06.959 --> 30:10.750
I cried. I was like, wow, like,
I could beat this. I can do something.

30:10.834 --> 30:13.291

30:13.375 --> 30:15.125

30:15.208 --> 30:17.208

30:17.291 --> 30:19.041
I stacked those gains like LEGOs.

30:19.125 --> 30:23.000
I was able to stand in water,
with full bracing.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.959
I was able to regulate
blood pressure.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.667
I was able to give my dad
a hug on Father's Day.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.208
I just started
to really break it down

30:30.291 --> 30:32.458
into those tiny, incremental

30:32.542 --> 30:35.166
improvements,
which were huge.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.500
♪ After you,
Hell should be easy ♪

30:41.917 --> 30:46.166
I got a lot more
shoulder movement, bicep,

30:46.250 --> 30:48.542
and also wrists,
so that was a huge thing.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.083
Had I not done the E-stim,

30:50.166 --> 30:53.458
I do not think I would've
gotten the wrist function back.

30:54.625 --> 30:58.333
I first started out just being propped up to stand in a standing frame.

31:00.750 --> 31:03.291
And then I went
to the parallel bars,

31:03.375 --> 31:06.166
and I was moving
one leg, another leg.

31:06.250 --> 31:09.500

31:09.583 --> 31:13.333
♪ Oh, oh-oh,

31:13.417 --> 31:15.792
Then, I had a walker.

31:15.875 --> 31:19.125
After the walker,
I went to my forearm crutches.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.834
From forearm crutches,
I walked out of the hospital,

31:21.917 --> 31:23.875
had my wheelchair
for long distances.

31:23.959 --> 31:27.333

31:36.375 --> 31:41.041
So,
you're picking up your trailing limbs a little early.

31:41.125 --> 31:42.500
Last day at Craig.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.875
I was hoping to walk
out of this place,

31:44.959 --> 31:47.291
but, uh, obviously,
that's not gonna happen.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.291
Keep plugging away
and try my best,

31:49.375 --> 31:52.542
and, hopefully, get back
on my feet here soon.

32:13.834 --> 32:15.750
I'll take some,
thank you very much.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.542
I love every single
one of you guys.

32:21.500 --> 32:25.917
The major thing that happens with a spinal cord injury is

32:26.000 --> 32:28.291
a metamorphosis.

32:28.375 --> 32:31.417
You change,
there's no choice.

32:31.500 --> 32:35.750
You're not the person that could do all
the things that you could do before.

32:35.834 --> 32:40.709
And when you're in a hospital,
there's a bubble of hope.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.792
There's a bubble
of possibilities that...

32:43.875 --> 32:47.458
that you'll walk again, that
you'll rehabilitate yourself,

32:47.542 --> 32:52.208
and you also are surrounded by people whose common goal it is

32:52.291 --> 32:56.917
to get you as better as possible,
as quickly as possible.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.041
And then when you
leave that environment,

32:59.125 --> 33:01.709
and you go back to the world...

33:03.041 --> 33:05.709
well, the bubble bursts.

33:26.083 --> 33:29.750
Leaving Paul is really hard for me.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.917
I mean, I still have
to go to work every day

33:33.000 --> 33:36.333
and live my life, too.

33:36.417 --> 33:40.917
It's stressful leaving him
in such a delicate state.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.709
A bunch of friends stepped up and helped modify my house a little bit.

33:50.709 --> 33:53.875
We had to put a ramp in the front to get in the front door.

33:54.291 --> 33:56.000
Where do you want
this guy, Paul?

33:56.083 --> 33:59.208
Uh, you can put
it right here.

33:59.625 --> 34:00.834
- Right here?
- Yeah.

34:00.917 --> 34:02.500
We had to cut a hole
in the wall so I can get

34:02.583 --> 34:04.834
from the front door
to my room in the back.

34:10.750 --> 34:13.041
They redecorated my entire room.

34:13.125 --> 34:15.917
They switched my mom's
side of the house,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.458
and it was now my side of the house 'cause it was bigger.

34:19.917 --> 34:24.875
But when no one's around is like when reality really sets in.

34:32.291 --> 34:34.667
It was my first time looking at my bedroom

34:34.750 --> 34:36.750
from a totally different level.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.875
And I looked around,
and I was like,

34:38.958 --> 34:40.792
whoa, this is my life.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.833
This is what it is right now.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.875
And I remember
bending over my chair,

34:44.958 --> 34:46.708
and I couldn't even
pick myself back up

34:46.792 --> 34:48.333
'cause I didn't have
the arm strength.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.208
And I just bawled my eyes out

34:50.291 --> 34:52.583
in the corner of my room 'cause I didn't wanna look at it,

34:52.667 --> 34:54.667
I didn't wanna go
further into the room.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.291
It becomes a lonely place.

35:04.333 --> 35:07.417
I would go to the window

35:07.500 --> 35:11.375
because I knew that was
the time of day

35:11.458 --> 35:15.667
when I could get sunlight
through the window.

35:53.917 --> 35:56.041
It was hard to see my house

35:56.125 --> 35:59.125
the way that I left it
the day of my accident.

35:59.208 --> 36:01.750
All my things were
still in place,

36:01.834 --> 36:04.250
but I knew that this is
where I needed to be.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.458
I couldn't stay in the hospital.
I needed to move on.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.875
I need to start moving
on with my life.

36:22.125 --> 36:23.750
The things I miss the most,

36:23.834 --> 36:27.834
the day to day things that
we do that we don't realize--

36:27.917 --> 36:31.333
especially around the house,
you know, like mowing the lawn, um...

36:32.083 --> 36:36.125
doing house repairs,
cleaning around the house.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.250
And then, of course,
like, you know...

36:40.166 --> 36:42.000
going out and building jumps.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.959
And I used to love going out
and scouting new lines...

36:46.041 --> 36:49.542
It was literally just Cam and I
enjoying that great time,

36:49.625 --> 36:52.750
and it sucks because
we don't do that anymore.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.625
Let's see you go from
one end to the other, Cameron.

36:57.709 --> 36:59.125
Peter Pan?

37:04.458 --> 37:07.417
Highlight of my day,
Cameron, always.

37:10.959 --> 37:13.375
Good!

37:13.458 --> 37:16.458
I met Cameron when
I was 15 years old.

37:16.542 --> 37:18.667
The first time
riding with Cameron,

37:18.750 --> 37:21.625
I was so blown away,
what he was doing on a mountain bike.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.709
He was doing all the tricks

37:24.792 --> 37:27.917
on a mountain bike that
I was doing on a BMX bike.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.083
So Cam and I, we became more
than just riding buddies.

37:34.166 --> 37:37.083
You know, we just started
becoming best friends.

37:37.166 --> 37:38.500
I got on his bike, was like,

37:38.583 --> 37:41.166
wow, this actually feels kind of good,
you know?

37:43.166 --> 37:45.125
Yeah, PB.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.166
He was like,
how do you feel about

37:47.250 --> 37:48.750
entering a mountain
bike contest?

37:48.834 --> 37:52.959
Had zero money,
so I ended up working as a plumber,

37:53.041 --> 37:56.792
and I saved enough to buy
a plane ticket to Whistler.

37:56.875 --> 38:00.625
I had never, ever hit jumps
that big in my entire life.

38:00.709 --> 38:02.917
Must've been at least
10,000 people that year.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.083
I was like, holy shit,
this the real deal for sure.

38:05.166 --> 38:07.834
Put your hands together for Paul Basagoitia!

38:09.458 --> 38:13.041
I was there on Cameron's bike,
it wasn't even my bike.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.792
I'm talking to myself. I'm like, man, Paul,
this is the time to shine.

38:18.875 --> 38:20.625
At the very last obstacle,

38:20.709 --> 38:23.625
I had no idea that I was
gonna backflip onto it

38:23.709 --> 38:25.291
and then tail whip off it.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.917
I was so shocked that
I just did something

38:30.000 --> 38:32.125
that I had no idea
was gonna work.

38:32.208 --> 38:33.834
I don't even own
a mountain bike yet!

38:33.917 --> 38:36.792
I remember Cameron running to me,
gave me the biggest hug.

38:36.875 --> 38:39.625
That's when I knew
it was a big deal.

38:41.333 --> 38:45.500
I would thank my sponsor,
but I don't have any sponsor, really.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.291
Going to Crankworx
the second year,

38:47.375 --> 38:49.375
I didn't want it to be a fluke.

38:57.917 --> 39:00.333
I'm so stoked! I mean,
last year I came out here,

39:00.417 --> 39:01.709
no sponsors nothing,

39:01.792 --> 39:03.792
and then I won, and then
I did the same thing.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.583
I can't believe I repeated it.
I just can't believe it.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.417
To defend my title was one of the best
feelings I had in my mountain bike career.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.250
I was not a fluke.

39:21.917 --> 39:24.083
Before he got hurt,
we started riding a lot more

39:24.166 --> 39:26.583
and I had my riding buddy back
and like, I was like,

39:26.667 --> 39:28.667
man, dude, we're gonna
load up bikes before we know it,

39:28.750 --> 39:31.417
and just like it
never happened and...

39:32.000 --> 39:34.250
Trust me, I think about
that every day.

39:34.959 --> 39:36.041
I can only
imagine, bud.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.166
Never in a million
years I thought

39:38.250 --> 39:39.458
I would be
paralyzed, you know?

39:39.542 --> 39:41.500
We've all taken
crashes and...

39:41.583 --> 39:43.375
what do we do? We hit
the ground, we get back up,

39:43.458 --> 39:45.875
you know, and this time,
it was definitely different.

39:45.959 --> 39:47.458
I'll devote any
amount of days

39:47.542 --> 39:49.875
that you want to go and ride,
and just, uh...

39:49.959 --> 39:51.250
I know that it's...

39:51.333 --> 39:54.625
it's tough, but
whenever you're ready.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.583
That day will come, man.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.750
Yeah.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.125
Be good though.

40:08.583 --> 40:11.917
- I'm here any time you need me, bud.
-: Thanks, man.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.667
I lost a lot more than...

40:22.000 --> 40:23.375
just my ability to walk.

40:23.458 --> 40:26.834
Like, I lost my friends
and my whole life that I had.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.709
I lost everything.

40:32.625 --> 40:35.291
Everything.

40:35.375 --> 40:39.291
Most people injure themselves when they're older.

40:39.375 --> 40:41.709
There's this
transition period

40:41.792 --> 40:44.667
that you go through,

40:44.750 --> 40:47.875
and I can't say that I've ever

40:47.959 --> 40:51.500
felt a... sense
of transitioning, you know?

40:51.583 --> 40:54.000
Like, this is
all I've ever known.

40:54.083 --> 40:57.917
I do definitely
get bouts of frustration

40:58.000 --> 40:59.709
and bouts of depression.

41:00.750 --> 41:03.458
I was so depressed...

41:04.041 --> 41:06.709
so lost that
I wouldn't even put...

41:07.125 --> 41:11.250
There was no reason to even get dressed in the morning.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.875
You know, why'd you
choose me, to happen to me?

41:13.959 --> 41:16.834
I got two kids
and... all that stuff.

41:16.917 --> 41:18.792
You know, I was coaching
their soccer teams

41:18.875 --> 41:21.291
and having fun with them,
and I was like...

41:21.375 --> 41:25.041
I was like thinking, man, life's over, dude.
I can't do nothing, you know?

41:25.709 --> 41:28.041
I sat there and laid
in my bed in my room,

41:28.125 --> 41:30.625
day up, day night, you know?

41:30.709 --> 41:32.625
Wouldn't get up, wouldn't
get in my wheelchair.

41:32.709 --> 41:35.375
Just laid there,
you know, pissed off.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.542
I didn't even know if
I could finish high school.

41:38.625 --> 41:39.959
Just to go back

41:40.041 --> 41:42.375
and be amongst all my friends.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.333
You know, they're out
there surfing and skating

41:44.417 --> 41:46.250
and partying
and having a good time.

41:46.333 --> 41:50.500
What am I gonna be able to do that even will allow me to have fun?

41:50.583 --> 41:53.458
Your friends are telling you
to get out and go do something,

41:53.542 --> 41:56.333
and you're laying there
and you physically

41:56.417 --> 41:58.291
can't get out of bed.

41:58.375 --> 42:01.792
And then they don't understand
why you just lay there.

42:01.875 --> 42:06.375
Mentally, you're just drained and it just drains your whole entire body.

42:06.458 --> 42:09.542
I mean, depression,
it is the worst thing.

42:11.583 --> 42:13.375
All right, here we go.

42:13.458 --> 42:15.750
You can't imagine the different world you live in,

42:15.834 --> 42:17.250
walking and not walking.

42:17.333 --> 42:18.709
Oh, Annette, we have all
these different groups,

42:18.792 --> 42:20.542
and you can still do
the things you wanna do.

42:20.625 --> 42:23.750
No!
I can't even get to the soccer field the way I wanna get there

42:23.834 --> 42:26.375
because someone blocked
the gate last week.

42:26.458 --> 42:29.625
I mean, literally,
some guy just blocked the one entranceway.

42:29.709 --> 42:31.583
Nobody could find him.
No one knew where his car was.

42:31.667 --> 42:34.041
That stuff happens
to me all the time.

42:34.125 --> 42:36.166
I just wanna live
my regular life,

42:36.250 --> 42:39.542
and not have it be a drama
for all the people around me.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.375
Where's the guy? Who has the key?
Where did he go?

42:41.458 --> 42:42.667
Oh no, how are
we gonna get her in?

42:42.750 --> 42:44.208
We gonna throw her
over the fence?

42:44.291 --> 42:46.125
Does someone have to carry her?
Then my husband's frustrated.

42:46.208 --> 42:48.500
Then my kids are like,
they gotta go to the game. You know, I just...

42:48.583 --> 42:52.208
That's the kind of thing
that makes me feel bad.

42:52.291 --> 42:56.417
As a human being,
I'm in the way, I'm a problem.

43:20.834 --> 43:22.542
- How's it going?
- Nice to meet you.

43:22.625 --> 43:24.333
Thanks for coming out,
appreciate it.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.041
Three hundred bucks!

43:32.125 --> 43:33.750
300! 320!

43:33.834 --> 43:36.542
- Got 600 for it!
- 600! Yeah!

43:36.625 --> 43:38.333
Whoo!

43:38.709 --> 43:40.875
800!

43:43.750 --> 43:46.250
- 900!
- A thousand bucks!

43:50.750 --> 43:52.291
- Yeah, baby!
- Yeah!

43:52.375 --> 43:53.750
- My turn!
- Yes!

43:53.834 --> 43:57.208
- A great big hug, man.
- A big hug, man.

43:57.291 --> 44:00.750
Dude!

44:00.834 --> 44:03.000
Thanks, buddy.

44:03.375 --> 44:04.709
Dude, you're an animal.

44:04.792 --> 44:06.417
- You're an animal, dude.
- Thanks, man.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.125
- You All right?
- I'm good. I just can't balance.

44:08.208 --> 44:11.000
I just can't balance.
But thanks, buddy, I appreciate it.

44:12.709 --> 44:14.959
Everybody come out to...

44:19.000 --> 44:20.250
Yeah, buddy!

44:25.083 --> 44:26.667
Love you guys!

44:26.750 --> 44:30.500
Once again,
there's no way I'd be able to do this without you guys.

44:30.583 --> 44:32.709
This fucking injury sucks,
I'm not gonna lie.

44:32.792 --> 44:36.000
Hate it. Everyday, I cry.
I wake up, I'm devastated,

44:36.083 --> 44:39.125
but you guys keep me
plugging away

44:39.208 --> 44:42.083
and trying my hardest to get
back on my feet, and I will.

44:42.166 --> 44:44.709
So, I'll see you guys,
and thank you.

45:36.041 --> 45:37.417
- Howdy!
- How you doing?

45:37.500 --> 45:38.542
What happened?

45:38.625 --> 45:40.750
- Broke my back.
- Oh!

45:40.834 --> 45:42.542

46:56.625 --> 46:59.834
Paul Basagoitia,
out here from Reno, Nevada!

47:45.792 --> 47:47.417
Bills.

47:49.041 --> 47:51.542
American Family
Insurance. Bills.

47:51.917 --> 47:53.542
They love me.

47:54.917 --> 47:56.875
Craig Hospital, big bill.

48:07.959 --> 48:10.917
I just trained like crazy,
all the time, every day.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.500
About eight to 10
hours a day of my life

48:13.583 --> 48:14.875
for about a year and a half

48:14.959 --> 48:17.709
went into improving my
condition, doing everything

48:17.792 --> 48:20.834
I can to defy anything that
any doctor ever told me.

48:55.208 --> 48:57.792
Nichole and I,
we actually went to high school together.

48:57.875 --> 49:01.834
She was one of those, like,
girls that are like, oh man...

49:02.834 --> 49:05.125
What do you think
about Nichole Munk?

49:05.208 --> 49:08.041
Never really thought I had
a chance with her because

49:08.125 --> 49:09.917
she was all about
cheerleading, so...

49:10.000 --> 49:11.834
she was always hanging
out with football players,

49:11.917 --> 49:13.875
basketball players
and stuff, and, uh,

49:13.959 --> 49:16.333
that definitely
wasn't really me.

49:19.709 --> 49:22.291
The first time
we actually hung out

49:22.375 --> 49:25.625
was five years after
we graduated from high school.

49:26.083 --> 49:28.375
Good thing I can do this, huh?

49:31.792 --> 49:33.625
Do you want me to drive, babe?

49:33.709 --> 49:35.333
I got it.

49:38.917 --> 49:40.542
When I got hurt,

49:40.625 --> 49:44.291
she made it very clear that
we're gonna do this together.

49:44.375 --> 49:47.542
I don't know how many other girls would've stuck around,
you know?

49:48.875 --> 49:50.500
But she stayed.

49:54.417 --> 49:58.375
There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about that accident.

49:59.250 --> 50:02.291
At least you, like,
weren't concussed--

50:02.375 --> 50:04.917
I kind of wish I was.
I wish I was knocked out,

50:05.000 --> 50:06.834
so I don't
remember any of it.

50:06.917 --> 50:09.333
- No because--
- The problem is, I know everything.

50:09.417 --> 50:12.166
I know, word by word,
I remember everything

50:12.250 --> 50:14.834
like it was yesterday.
That's the shitty part is...

50:14.917 --> 50:16.709
I deal with this
every single day

50:16.792 --> 50:18.875
because I remember
it so clearly.

50:30.667 --> 50:32.917
- There's the site.
- Holy.

50:42.583 --> 50:44.125
Oh.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.166
Rampage Strait!
What up?

50:46.250 --> 50:48.166
- How you doing, dude?
- Cool. How you doing?

50:48.250 --> 50:50.041
- How's it out there?
- Pretty good, man.

50:50.125 --> 50:52.125
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

51:06.959 --> 51:08.875
Where I caught
my pedal, huh?

51:08.959 --> 51:10.125
Right here, yeah,

51:10.208 --> 51:12.333
and then you landed...

51:13.375 --> 51:14.333
there.

51:14.417 --> 51:16.250
Cliff's not
even that tall.

51:16.333 --> 51:17.917
- Yeah.
- I guess going--

51:18.000 --> 51:19.542
You were going
fast though.

51:19.625 --> 51:21.500
Going 50 miles per hour.

51:40.917 --> 51:42.875
Even though it's given me so much,

51:42.959 --> 51:46.792
I go through the emotions
weekly of...

51:46.875 --> 51:48.667
I hate that sport.
You know, I hate...

51:48.750 --> 51:52.125
that I dedicated my life
to it and it did this to me.

52:26.667 --> 52:28.625
For 10 years straight,

52:28.709 --> 52:32.875
I did everything
that I could to walk again.

52:32.959 --> 52:34.625
We put all of our
resources into it.

52:34.709 --> 52:37.208
I fought...

52:37.583 --> 52:39.875
as hard as I've ever
fought for anything.

52:43.041 --> 52:44.458
Let go.

52:46.875 --> 52:48.875
Like a pump.

52:50.125 --> 52:54.667
Get rid of the CO2
effectively,

52:54.750 --> 52:57.333
influencing the chemistry
of the body.

53:03.125 --> 53:05.458
We do 30 breaths.

53:09.959 --> 53:11.583
Jessy, what's up, buddy?

53:14.542 --> 53:17.125
If you have any sensation
below your injury,

53:17.208 --> 53:19.250
man, that's, that's huge.

53:22.500 --> 53:26.166
I'm able to walk around with two AFO braces,
two canes,

53:26.250 --> 53:29.959
and I'm also able to pedal
a stationary bike as well.

53:33.083 --> 53:35.375
I have my core, I have my quads,

53:35.458 --> 53:37.458
so that's how I'm
able to get around.

53:37.542 --> 53:40.166
But what's holding me
back to walk is my glutes.

53:40.250 --> 53:43.208
So, if you take the canes
or the crutches away from me,

53:43.291 --> 53:45.625
I just fall down.

53:51.333 --> 53:52.709
Oh wow.

54:05.291 --> 54:06.625
While some recipients

54:06.709 --> 54:09.250
claim to receive great
benefits from stem cells,

54:09.333 --> 54:13.458
these treatments are not available past clinical trials in the US.

54:13.542 --> 54:15.750
However, overseas...

54:15.834 --> 54:18.417
Summer of 2015,
I started a medical trial.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.208
I was patient zero.

54:20.291 --> 54:22.250
The science
that they were using on me

54:22.333 --> 54:24.875
had me standing up,
weight-bearing.

54:24.959 --> 54:27.667
I had regained movement
and control of my hips.

54:27.750 --> 54:30.166
I still have control
of my hips now.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.375
I used to be paralyzed
from the ribs down.

54:32.458 --> 54:35.750
My body is... way different
than it used to be

54:35.834 --> 54:39.083
because of this
trial specifically.

54:39.166 --> 54:43.083
But the trial unleashed
a whole new world

54:43.166 --> 54:47.000
of so much pain,
so much spasticity, so much...

54:48.458 --> 54:50.667
so many symptoms that,

54:50.750 --> 54:53.542
for years, I was
lucky to never have.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.291
Do I wanna be the first
guy in space? No.

54:57.375 --> 54:59.041
I'll wait until, like,

54:59.125 --> 55:00.750
space travel is...

55:00.834 --> 55:03.166
is pretty safe
and everyone's doing it.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.041
There's this website
where it shows

55:05.125 --> 55:06.917
every single trial
in the world,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.917
and I went one day,
I spent four hours

55:09.000 --> 55:11.583
going through 800
different trials,

55:11.667 --> 55:13.709
looking at them,
reading them,

55:13.792 --> 55:15.959
and I found two.
I found two that I was like,

55:16.041 --> 55:17.291
oh, this sounds good.

55:17.375 --> 55:19.166
And then I sent them
to my doctor, and he's like no.

55:31.333 --> 55:35.166
Probably what you did was got back nerves in the early phase

55:35.250 --> 55:37.667
that were injured
but not dead.

55:37.750 --> 55:41.083
The ones that were actually
damaged completely died off,

55:41.166 --> 55:43.667
and they're likely
in the process of

55:43.750 --> 55:45.917
re-enervating
or regrowth.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.750
How do we speed
up that recovery?

55:50.250 --> 55:51.500
- You don't.
- You don't?

55:51.583 --> 55:54.083
You don't think stem cells
would help that out or--

55:54.166 --> 55:56.834
- Well... You know--
- What's your take on that?

55:56.917 --> 55:58.834
It's something that
could be considered.

55:58.917 --> 56:02.000
I'd kinda wanna know where you really are at before we did that,

56:02.083 --> 56:05.625
because you may be in a phase of rapid regrowth by yourself.

56:05.709 --> 56:07.917
You're finding out that one
of the big problems is that

56:08.000 --> 56:10.166
there's a whole lack of
information out there.

56:10.250 --> 56:11.542
You kind of get
lost in this mix

56:11.625 --> 56:13.667
of who knows all
this stuff properly.

56:15.083 --> 56:17.000
I'm finally hearing about stem cells,

56:17.083 --> 56:19.208
and I still have to get
the right answers.

56:19.291 --> 56:21.709
I gotta know a little bit
more about embryonic

56:21.792 --> 56:23.208
and adult stem cells.

56:23.291 --> 56:25.709
So, I'm kind of just
going day by day

56:25.792 --> 56:27.792
and learning on my own.

56:35.375 --> 56:37.333
I'm lower level, I'm T12,

56:37.417 --> 56:38.917
and I don't have glutes.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.834
I got my quads,
I got some hamstrings.

56:40.917 --> 56:42.959
So I'm able to get around
with canes, you know,

56:43.041 --> 56:44.917
but if I go get
this treatment,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.166
and it fires up
just my glutes?

56:47.250 --> 56:48.458
That's
life-changing for me.

56:48.542 --> 56:50.709
Everything got better
after my first treatment--

56:50.792 --> 56:53.625
like skin color,
like muscle tone.

57:02.750 --> 57:04.709
I'm considering
adult stem cells.

57:04.792 --> 57:07.750
It's coming out of your bone marrow,
it's all you. It's natural.

57:07.834 --> 57:10.333
Adult stem cells
are not good enough

57:10.417 --> 57:13.417
for a treatment for
spinal cord injury.

57:13.500 --> 57:16.959
Embryonic stem cell treatment
is, by far, the way to go.

57:28.417 --> 57:30.750
The chances with embryonic are

57:30.834 --> 57:35.083
if that embryo has
a DNA pattern of cancer,

57:35.166 --> 57:37.458
you can be putting a disease
back into your body.

57:37.542 --> 57:40.500
I would by far tell you
that if you were gonna do it,

57:40.583 --> 57:42.000
- do it with your own cells.
- Right.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.458
At your age, you're still
making decent stem cells.

57:44.542 --> 57:46.125
There's been so many people that showed

57:46.208 --> 57:48.166
huge progress
getting stem cells,

57:48.250 --> 57:50.583
and then I watched
a documentary last week,

57:50.667 --> 57:53.000
and this dude goes
backwards, you know?

57:53.083 --> 57:56.125
He lost the function of
his bowels and bladder...

57:56.208 --> 57:57.500
It made him worse.

57:57.583 --> 58:00.458
I got a stem cell treatment in Germany.

58:00.542 --> 58:02.125
I did get nerve pain,

58:02.208 --> 58:04.542
which doctors say
it's good,

58:04.625 --> 58:05.792
but...

58:05.875 --> 58:07.959
it's not an easy
thing to live with.

58:08.041 --> 58:10.041
Also, very expensive.

58:10.125 --> 58:11.458
On paper,

58:11.542 --> 58:13.667
there's nothing that
says that it works.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.208
When I first got injured,
they said that

58:15.291 --> 58:18.041
there would be
a cure in five years.

58:19.959 --> 58:22.125
And then when that
five years passed,

58:22.208 --> 58:24.375
they said there'd be
a cure in five years.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.959
I've been injured for 21 years,

58:27.500 --> 58:29.792
and I've heard that
four different times.

58:30.125 --> 58:33.000
This is spinal cord injury,
the unknown.

58:33.083 --> 58:35.792
Being in that
unknown zone is...

58:35.875 --> 58:38.125
there's nothing scarier.

58:39.875 --> 58:42.000
Dr. Hans Keirstead,
he's been

58:42.083 --> 58:44.834
part of the whole stem cell research from the beginning.

58:44.917 --> 58:48.333
In 2002,
he actually made a paralyzed rat

58:48.417 --> 58:50.333
be able to walk
after injecting

58:50.417 --> 58:53.834
embryonic stem cells into
the spinal cord of the rat.

58:53.917 --> 58:55.250
That is
incredible.

58:55.333 --> 58:58.333
If you were in my position,
what would you do?

58:58.417 --> 59:00.959
I'd be very
leery of...

59:01.041 --> 59:04.792
99.9 % of
the overseas work.

59:04.875 --> 59:07.250
If you're down in Mexico,

59:07.333 --> 59:10.000
making a treatment
that's unregulated,

59:10.083 --> 59:12.709
who knows if its
actually safe

59:12.792 --> 59:14.125
or efficacious?

59:14.208 --> 59:17.750
Now, this treatment that we developed,
is it ever gonna

59:17.834 --> 59:21.083
effect 100 % a cure?
No, it won't.

59:21.834 --> 59:23.500
You gotta get
in there soon.

59:23.583 --> 59:25.041
The treatment,
I designed it

59:25.125 --> 59:28.041
to be used within
weeks, not years.

59:30.667 --> 59:32.458
Did you really think that...

59:33.375 --> 59:35.291
it would 100 %?

59:35.959 --> 59:37.291
I mean...

59:38.458 --> 59:41.083
I worked my ass off
to get to that 100 %,

59:41.166 --> 59:42.834
but, I mean...

59:42.917 --> 59:45.333
Absolutely.
Yeah, that's never in question.

59:45.417 --> 59:49.333
I'm not gonna change my mindset,
you know, regardless.

59:51.834 --> 59:54.875
He wants to be walking with no crutches.

59:56.083 --> 59:58.250
I want him to realize
he's come so far

59:58.333 --> 01:00:00.792
and he's upright
and he is walking.

01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:04.834
I don't care to run a mile
in under seven minutes.

01:00:04.917 --> 01:00:08.625
I just wanna take a shower standing up,
just little simple things.

01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:12.000
End of the day, I just
wanna have independence.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:14.834
I don't think I ever thought

01:00:14.917 --> 01:00:17.166
that I could
possibly die this way

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.333
without ever taking
another step.

01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:22.667
I mean, I just...

01:00:23.834 --> 01:00:25.000
I don't--

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.542
I don't know,

01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:28.250
but I guess it's possible.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:31.333
I mean, it's possible
that could be it for me.

01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:34.291
I still think, in my dreams,

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.041
I'm walking.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.542
For this journey,

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:48.458
we focused on fetal stem cells,

01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:50.583
arguably the most contested

01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:52.333
and controversial form

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:54.792
of stem cell therapy to date.

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:57.291
I didn't even know that
even existed until basically

01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.041
you brought that
to my attention.

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:00.709
It's just crazy how...

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:06.583
They use the stem cells from an unborn fetus,

01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:08.917
the mother's going to have
an abortion anyway.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.542
After the abortion, rather
than discard that fetus,

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:15.417
they harvest the stem cells.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.166
What we need is the neuron cells,

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:20.417
so fetal stems cells, you're
able to get that neuron cell.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.000
I know it's only
been a couple weeks,

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:24.291
but have you seen any
gains from this treatment?

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.250
Man, that's amazing.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.709
If I can get my glutes
to fire back up,

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.542
that would be
life-changing for me.

01:01:39.542 --> 01:01:41.750
If you mention the word stem cells,

01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:44.000
everyone's like,
oh, you're nuts.

01:01:44.083 --> 01:01:46.583
Second off, if you tell them
what kind of stem cells,

01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:48.834
fetal stem cells,
people are gonna be like...

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.333
now, you're really crazy.

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:52.000
And then to top it off,
to tell them

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.709
you're gonna go
to Tijuana, Mexico, to get it?

01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:58.458
Oh man, I don't even wanna have
that conversation with people.

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:01.917
I just can't watch it.
I don't wanna watch it.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.583
- I really don't.
- Until you watch

01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:06.959
this documentary,
you should have an open mind about it.

01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:09.500
But right now, you're
so one-sided because

01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:12.375
all you're
thinking of is,

01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:15.083
you're gonna go get stem
cells by aborted fetuses,

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:17.291
but it's not
like that.

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:19.125
I would've never
thought that--

01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:21.542
and I'm sure you didn't either--
that we'd be in a position

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:23.500
where we actually have
to make a tough decision

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:26.291
based off of something
that's really fucked up.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.792
- It's hard to explain--
- You know, but the thing is

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:31.041
here's what's
always gonna happen,

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:34.166
and this is always
what you're gonna say.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.458
"Well, you're not
in my position,

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:37.166
so you don't
understand."

01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:40.291
- And you know that's true.
- Absolutely.

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:42.417
No one in your immediate corner

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.583
ever understands exactly.

01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:46.417
They don't mean to not und--

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.542
but no one understands,
like, how...

01:02:49.083 --> 01:02:51.208
difficult some
things are, or how...

01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:54.291
what you go through every day,
as much as they try to.

01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:56.583
Everybody thinks there's
no hope for this injury.

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:59.500
I truly believe
there is.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.625
I'm willing to try whatever it is

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:04.750
to get out of where
we're at right now,

01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:07.250
because it's been
terri-- it's...

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:09.625
mentally, like,
it's not fun.

01:03:09.709 --> 01:03:11.959
You're not a pleasant
person to be around.

01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:14.625
I'm pretty committed.
I already put the deposit in,

01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:17.208
and I'm heading
down there for sure.

01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:20.583
You're gonna go
to Tijuana with me?

01:03:52.709 --> 01:03:55.125
We're literally in a strip mall.

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:56.792
Fucking stem cells.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.000
- At least that place looks nice.
- Really?

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:04.291
It looks like
Frankie's Spa in Reno.

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.542
Like we should be
getting pedicures,

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:08.667
not stem cells.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:50.458
It hasn't even been a week since the stem cell treatment.

01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:52.375
It's funny 'cause every
morning, I'm like, okay,

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:54.291
is there gonna be a new muscle group to fire back up?

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:57.166
And it's not like that.
It's gonna take months

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:58.625
to see any sort of gains,

01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:01.875
and hopefully I see
some gains with muscle.

01:05:01.959 --> 01:05:05.291
You know,
I wanna see my muscle groups to start firing back up

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:07.667
and to get stronger
and hopefully start

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.959
wiggling some toes here soon.

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:36.291
I'm kind of heartbroken.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:41.458
The only thing that the whole procedure really did to me

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:43.166
was drain my bank account.

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:47.709
You don't want two canes?

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:49.875
No, I want to look
like I'm doing better

01:05:49.959 --> 01:05:51.417
when I go see
my sponsors.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.208
Good call.

01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.667
99.9 % of people

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:59.750
told me don't do it,
but I think I'm better off

01:05:59.834 --> 01:06:02.500
failing, opposed
to never trying.

01:06:04.709 --> 01:06:06.166
Whoa!

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:07.417
Paul!

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.000
- Victor.
- It's good to see you.

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:11.250
- You, too, man, how you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:13.250
- How you doing?
- Not bad, man, not bad.

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:15.291
So stoked to
see you, man.

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:18.417
I think what helped me progress

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.625
to one cane was time.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.667
Yeah, maybe
you progress the most

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.208
in the first two years,
but I don't think

01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:30.417
it's over on
that second year.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.041
I think there's still
time to get better.

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.500
I've seen it in other cases.

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:38.417
Took Christopher Reeves five years to be able to move a finger.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.875
It took this one girl
I follow on social media,

01:06:41.959 --> 01:06:45.208
and it took her
seven years to...

01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:48.792
get out of a wheelchair
and start walking with crutches.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.458
Well, it was three years in
that I got my bladder back,

01:06:51.542 --> 01:06:53.375
and that was when I was
pregnant with Ingrid.

01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.959
I'm three years out
and I'm still improving.

01:06:56.041 --> 01:06:58.291
I just started
being able to move

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:00.625
my lower left
leg, my knee.

01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:04.041
I went to physical therapy
and occupational therapy...

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:07.291
all growing up and...

01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:08.959
I started this...

01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:12.250
physical, intensive
physical therapy

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.375
at this place called
Project Walk...

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:17.458
when I was 10.

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.250
Fast-forward eight years,

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:20.625
when I was graduating
high school,

01:07:20.709 --> 01:07:22.458
I walked across the stage

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:24.125
at my graduation.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:26.291
The more I go through this
injury, the more I realize that

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.458
no one knows anything,
and I just...

01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:30.709
I just chip away at
every day of trying to...

01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:32.125
get a little bit better.

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:34.625
Just remove the concept of time

01:07:34.709 --> 01:07:35.875
with this injury.

01:07:35.959 --> 01:07:38.083
This isn't a broken
bone where 12 weeks,

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:41.709
I can cut a cast off and start
getting on with life.

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.792
This is a lifestyle.

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:47.375
This is a new way
of living and being.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.291
Thank you so much for answering my boys

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:55.041
when they sent
you messages.

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:56.917
All good. I love the support.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.792
- You guys are great.
- And they just...

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:01.125
- They're so happy that you answered them.
- Yeah.

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:04.041
- Hey, it was finally nice meeting you.
- He told his whole class...

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:06.250
And what a hero you were.
It was awesome to them.

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:07.500
Thank you, man,
I appreciate that.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:08.917
And they saw you and
they were so nervous.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.542
They walked around
you a couple of times.

01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:12.542
Aw.

01:08:13.959 --> 01:08:16.000
The last 14 years I've been coming to Crankworx,

01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:17.917
I've been competing
at some type of event,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.250
so it's kinda weird
coming here and...

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:22.082
kinda just watching.

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.917
- Good luck.
- It's like a kid at a candy store

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.917
and walking out with no candy.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.250
Good man. Gonna
win it this year?

01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:31.417
Last time I did pump track,
it was you and me, man.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.166
The reality is that there's

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.625
human suffering.
That's the thing.

01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:36.875
I was actually mad at myself

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:38.582
for knowing that reality

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:41.082
and not accepting my own.
Like not saying,

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:42.625
that I'm gonna be
subject to that, too.

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:45.250
I'm gonna be subject
to the laws of nature

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:46.457
and other people making errors.

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:48.417
I'm gonna be subject
to suffering.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.750
This was my first
real suffering.

01:08:50.834 --> 01:08:52.417
It was...

01:08:53.207 --> 01:08:54.792
I can't say I handled
it brilliantly.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:57.750
I think it was just more
shocking, and before,

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:00.750
suffering was always something
that I thought about...

01:09:00.834 --> 01:09:02.625
maybe it'd happen
mostly to someone else,

01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:04.375
or I think the things
I'd been through

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:05.834
really were more adversity,

01:09:05.917 --> 01:09:07.792
and adversity is something
you can overcome.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:10.875
You can pull up your bootstraps,
you can get through it.

01:09:10.959 --> 01:09:13.166
But suffering is
something that you endure.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:24.667
Last week,
a kid found out that I was in Mexico

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.457
and got stem cells,
and he said,

01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:29.457
"I'm on my way next
month to get it done.

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:31.250
What do you think?"

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:33.082
I told him, hey...

01:09:33.582 --> 01:09:34.834
Don't do it.

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:36.332
I feel like I'm not

01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:39.000
improving that much,
you know, or at all.

01:09:39.082 --> 01:09:40.750
To a point that...

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:44.125
At least to a point that
I would be able to walk

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:46.332
without any
assistance, you know?

01:09:46.417 --> 01:09:48.166
I think you're
improving. I mean,

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.207
and it's probably easier for
me to say you're improving

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:53.750
than it is for
you to, you know,

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:57.125
like you wanna
be improving

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:59.166
more and
faster, but--

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.166
To be honest with you,

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.667
I'm definitely
second guessing

01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:05.875
the future and my outcome.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:09.000
That makes me choke
up a little bit.

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:11.166
I've just never
heard you say...

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.083
maybe, this
is it for me.

01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:15.333
- Like, that's...
- I know.

01:10:19.834 --> 01:10:21.583
We always want more.

01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:28.792
As humans, we always want more,
no matter what the situation is.

01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:33.125
I used to be the strongest
person to walk into the room.

01:10:34.667 --> 01:10:37.333
I don't know, like
I'm... I'm weak.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.792
You're definitely allowed to be sad,

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.542
and you're definitely allowed
to get depressed and you're...

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:53.208
you don't have to
fight those feelings,

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:56.250
but you do have to be open to...

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:58.917
change, and you have
to be open to...

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.625
figuring out how to move on.

01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:03.625
If I had gotten frustrated
and resisted everything

01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:05.000
that was a challenge,

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.917
it would be my entire life.
I would be frustrated

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.834
and annoyed and depressed and...

01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:13.000
that's just no way
to live, you know?

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:16.750
If you sustained a spinal
cord injury and you survived,

01:11:16.834 --> 01:11:18.542
you've got a second chance.

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:20.959
This is your second...

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:22.625
your second ticket...

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:25.291
on the same train
of life, right?

01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:28.542
So, you shouldn't waste it.

01:11:38.875 --> 01:11:40.834
Before this injury,

01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:43.458
I would always tell
myself I would...

01:11:43.542 --> 01:11:46.875
probably take my life
if I was ever paralyzed.

01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:56.375
I'm so glad that

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:58.667
I was able to overcome that.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.875
- Still taking photos?
- I'm a perfectionist.

01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:36.834
- We have tomorrow--
- I need to get that right photo.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:40.250
Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday to do that.

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:42.542
Life is not guaranteed.

01:13:11.417 --> 01:13:15.250
Just because I accept my situation,
doesn't mean

01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:17.333
this is it.

01:13:17.417 --> 01:13:20.208
It doesn't mean that
I can't change it

01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:21.792
or control it

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:23.917
or move past it.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.375
And so that's the beautiful
part about acceptance.

01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:29.792
It's not admitting defeat.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:33.583
It's empowering yourself
to move forward.

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:40.208
I've given all of myself to this process,

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:43.417
and I respect my injury.
I know my body works

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.750
hard for me. I know I have
a spinal cord injury.

01:13:45.834 --> 01:13:47.041
It's gnarly.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:50.291
I'm surrounded by it every day.
I live it every day.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:52.583
And my mantra is gratitude.

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:55.417
I really accept it
for what it is

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.834
and the limitations
that it has, and that's okay.

01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:00.875
I actually feel I'm
still a whole person,

01:14:00.959 --> 01:14:03.667
a valuable person.
That hasn't changed.

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.250
My value is equal.

01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:08.083
I still believe that I can
walk. I still have hope.

01:14:08.166 --> 01:14:10.917
So for me to accept it
means that I'm giving up

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.125
that hope to walk again.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.750
I've learned to live with it.

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:21.125
I've learned to live
with my disability.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:25.959
Every day is a challenge.

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:29.333
But no, I can't say
that I've accepted it.

01:14:30.959 --> 01:14:33.667
I still have a 5 % chance.

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.625
I try to be thankful

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:44.417
for what I do have,

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.625
and understand that

01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:49.875
I did love my sport and
that's why I was doing it.

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:57.375
I just have a whole a different
outlook on what I feel

01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:59.458
is important in life now.

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:06.792
Get that seven!

01:15:06.875 --> 01:15:08.125
As we look to the top,

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:12.041
Cam Zink, a husband,
a father of two.

01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:14.917
This is the steepest line
in the history of Rampage.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.667
A 63 degree angle slope after he lands this massive cliff drop,

01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.750
and here he comes.

01:15:26.417 --> 01:15:28.250
Zink over the edge!

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.041
There he is!

01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:33.250
You did it, Zink!

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.417
My life's not half as exciting as it was,
that's for sure.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.667
I think I'm okay with it.
It's time to move forward,

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.208
move on.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.208
Your eyes are not deceiving you.

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.291
Paul Basagoitia, Paul Bass on
set. Paul, welcome my friend.

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.417
Good to see you guys.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.125
Such hallowed grounds
behind us here.

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:55.959
It's hard to come
back sometimes.

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:57.792
Last year, it was really
hard for me to come back,

01:15:57.875 --> 01:16:00.792
but this year,
it feels good to be back.

01:16:01.917 --> 01:16:04.750
I have not accepted
my injury 100 %,

01:16:04.834 --> 01:16:08.291
but I do appreciate
where I'm at in life.

01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:12.458
Last week, I was so upset that
I couldn't go wakeboarding

01:16:12.542 --> 01:16:14.041
or wakeskating with
all my friends,

01:16:14.125 --> 01:16:15.375
and I was just on the boat,

01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:18.709
watching my friends
have a good time.

01:16:18.792 --> 01:16:21.291
Something just clicked
in my brain. It was like,

01:16:21.375 --> 01:16:24.625
well, at least I was
able to get in that boat.

01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:32.959
I just put my hand
in the water...

01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:37.375
feeling the temperature,

01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:40.625
the texture,

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:44.041
and I feel a connection to
the people that can't do that.

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:47.250
Came up with an idea about surfing again,

01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:50.166
and made a surfboard where
I can lay down on my stomach,

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.667
and then...

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:55.291
they push me into a wave down at
Cardiff Reef in San Diego and...

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:00.709
I had rode the Jet Ski by myself,

01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:02.417
and that's where I felt my...

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.333
sense of normalness come back.

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:08.208
True feeling of
independence again.

01:18:08.291 --> 01:18:10.375
At first,
I'd go out to support groups

01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:13.792
and talk with other injured
SCI patients, you know?

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:15.959
I like to go to
concerts, baseball games,

01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:18.667
you know. I do more stuff
now than I did when I walked.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.583
One thing for me was driving.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:23.834
Put all the windows down,
feel the wind in your hair.

01:18:23.917 --> 01:18:25.583
Hell yeah.

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.000
I love playing rugby.

01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:29.125
I'm a quadriplegic, but I can...

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.625
absolutely wreck
someone's day

01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:33.166
in my rugby chair.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.542
I had no idea what I was doing,

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:38.375
calling all these girls.
"Hey, do you wanna dance?"

01:18:38.458 --> 01:18:41.709
And they're like, sure?
In a wheelchair? Sure?

01:18:42.041 --> 01:18:44.041
Five years later, it's...

01:18:44.125 --> 01:18:46.834
a dance company I never
thought I could have.

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:49.083
I kicked off my music career.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.375
I started riding a bicycle
again, but on my terms.

01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:55.000
I would go ride to ride,

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:57.917
just pedal the damn thing.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.166
I never thought that I would be a human robot

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.458
back in the '80s when I
was watching Robocop.

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:05.375
And I was
like, oh my God!

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:08.333
You want me to show you?

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:10.417
It's amazing to
stand and to look at

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.667
your friends at eye level.

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:17.041
I make a big deal about it
because for so many years,

01:19:17.125 --> 01:19:20.000
I've been used to people
kind of looking down on me.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.125
If you could take a pill

01:21:26.208 --> 01:21:29.709
and wake up tomorrow morning
and be completely healed,

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:32.083
what's the first
thing you would do?

01:21:40.083 --> 01:21:42.250
I don't know.

01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:47.500
I don't wanna ruin the drama,
but I have no clue.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.375
The first thing I would
do is go to the beach.

01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:57.250
Yep. It's crazy 'cause...

01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:00.041
the last time I was at
the beach and I was able

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:02.417
to feel the sand
between my toes,

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.417
I remember walking
off and running back

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.875
just to feel it one more time.

01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:09.667
The first thing I would think
to do and the first thing I'd...

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:14.709
try to do is just give my
mom a big hug, standing up...

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:19.500
'cause I've never
done that before.

01:22:21.667 --> 01:22:23.959
I would run and never stop.

01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:26.959
Just like...

01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:29.208
just like Forrest Gump.

01:22:29.917 --> 01:22:32.291
Have everybody run with me.

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:35.166
I'd run with my mom,
I'd run with my dad.

01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:38.291
My brother.

01:22:38.375 --> 01:22:40.500
I would run.

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.750

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:54.542
