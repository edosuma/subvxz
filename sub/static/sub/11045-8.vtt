00:01.402 --> 00:04.405
**

00:12.313 --> 00:13.514
* Ponies' voices
fill the night! *

00:13.547 --> 00:15.716
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

00:15.749 --> 00:17.618
* Happy hearts so
full and bright *

00:17.651 --> 00:19.653
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

00:19.687 --> 00:21.655
* Oh what a sight!

00:21.689 --> 00:23.624
* Look at the light.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.726
* All for tonight.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.362
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

00:28.396 --> 00:30.298
**

00:30.331 --> 00:32.166
* Clouds arranged so
they're just so. *

00:32.200 --> 00:34.135
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

00:34.168 --> 00:36.237
* Gonna make some
awesome snow. *

00:36.270 --> 00:38.139
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

00:38.172 --> 00:40.141
* The chill wind blows

00:40.174 --> 00:42.076
* Making a show

00:42.110 --> 00:44.112
* Snowflakes aglow

00:44.145 --> 00:46.580
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

00:46.614 --> 00:50.251
**

00:50.284 --> 00:52.386
* A day that's filled
with songs to sing *

00:52.420 --> 00:54.422
* Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding

00:54.455 --> 00:56.424
* Cakes and pastries
we shall bring *

00:56.457 --> 00:58.459
* Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding

00:58.492 --> 01:00.328
* We're so busy
making merry *

01:00.361 --> 01:02.463
* Windigos should
all be wary *

01:02.496 --> 01:04.598
* As our mighty
voices carry *

01:04.632 --> 01:07.135
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again! *

01:07.168 --> 01:08.736
**

01:08.769 --> 01:10.671
* Decorations we shall make.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.640
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

01:12.673 --> 01:14.742
* Perfection you
just cannot fake. *

01:14.775 --> 01:16.644
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

01:16.677 --> 01:18.546
* Not one mistake

01:18.579 --> 01:19.780
* Don't let that break!

01:19.813 --> 01:21.115
* [smash]

01:21.149 --> 01:22.750
* Oh, Goodness Sake!

01:22.783 --> 01:25.653
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again *

01:25.686 --> 01:29.190
* Happy, Happy,
Hearth's Warming, *

01:29.223 --> 01:33.161
* Hearth's Warming, Happy,
Happy, Hearth's Warming Eve. *

01:33.194 --> 01:35.263
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again *

01:39.200 --> 01:41.735
Hey, Starlight! Ready
to celebrate your first

01:41.769 --> 01:44.305
Hearth's Warming Eve
here in Ponyville?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.774
I was thinking I
might just skip it.

01:46.807 --> 01:47.675
[gasp]

01:50.811 --> 01:54.715
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:54.748 --> 01:56.684
* Aaaahhh

01:56.717 --> 01:58.719
* My little Pony

01:58.752 --> 02:01.322
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

02:01.355 --> 02:03.191
* My Little Pony

02:03.224 --> 02:05.626
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

02:05.659 --> 02:07.661
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

02:07.695 --> 02:09.830
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

02:09.863 --> 02:12.166
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

02:12.200 --> 02:14.202
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

02:14.235 --> 02:16.304
* To have my little pony

02:16.337 --> 02:19.607
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

02:19.640 --> 02:21.909
**

02:27.348 --> 02:29.583
SKIP HEARTH'S WARMING EVE?

02:29.617 --> 02:32.886
I just find it all
a little silly.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.924
It's mostly a day dedicated to
presents and candy, isn't it?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.293
And why would you deny
yourself presents and candy?

02:39.327 --> 02:40.828
That's crazy talk!

02:40.861 --> 02:43.731
I THINK what Spike
means to say is,

02:43.764 --> 02:46.867
Hearth's Warming is about
more than presents and candy.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.203
It's a time to spend
with friends and family

02:49.237 --> 02:50.838
when we celebrate a
very important day

02:50.871 --> 02:52.706
in Equestria's history.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.376
I think to most ponies,
it's just an excuse

02:55.409 --> 02:57.378
for silly songs and fun,

02:57.411 --> 02:59.413
not a day to remember
some old story.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.717
Maybe you just haven't
heard the right

03:03.751 --> 03:05.653
Hearth's Warming
Eve story yet.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.955
Earth ponies, pegasi
and unicorns sing songs

03:07.988 --> 03:10.391
around a hearth to fight
back an eternal winter

03:10.424 --> 03:12.360
caused by the
mythical Windigos?

03:12.393 --> 03:15.229
[laugh] Every foal and
filly knows that story.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.965
Not THAT one. My
favorite holiday story.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.800
A Hearth's Warming Tale.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.235
Oooooo! I love that one!

03:24.638 --> 03:28.509
This is the story of a powerful
unicorn named Snowfall Frost

03:28.542 --> 03:30.678
who hated Hearth's
Warming Eve!

03:30.711 --> 03:34.415
It all began many moons
ago in Canterlot...

03:34.448 --> 03:38.018
Every home in Canterlot was
filled with Holiday spirit.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.255
Every home except one.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.491
It was said of Snowfall that
she was almost as studied

03:43.524 --> 03:45.693
as Starswirl the Bearded.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.363
Almost, since everypony knows
that Starswirl was an expert

03:49.397 --> 03:51.399
at everything from
transfiguration,

03:51.432 --> 03:53.901
Dimensional Calibration,
Teleportation--

03:53.934 --> 03:56.370
Spike: We get it.
Starswirl's awesome.

03:56.404 --> 04:00.641
Right. The point is, Snowfall
was also a powerful unicorn.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.576
She wanted to be perfect.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.446
Anything that got in the way
of that was a waste of time.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.547
Ugh!

04:06.580 --> 04:09.783
[clanging bells]

04:09.817 --> 04:13.287
Well, that batch is
ruined. SNOWDASH!

04:13.321 --> 04:15.889
Snowdash was Snowfall's
loyal assistant.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.857
What do you need?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.659
Get this mess cleaned up.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.994
Those foolish ponies were
ringing those blasted bells

04:21.028 --> 04:23.931
outside the window and
I lost my concentration.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.866
Whoa. Ponies
actually enjoying

04:25.899 --> 04:28.969
Hearth's Warming Eve. Where
did they get that crazy idea?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.938
Today is nothing
to celebrate.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.407
Hearth's Warming
Eve is a menace,

04:33.441 --> 04:35.643
a dangerous day for
all of Equestria.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.346
Dangerous? It's awesome!

04:38.379 --> 04:40.714
It's the day we remember
how unicorns, pegasi,

04:40.748 --> 04:42.783
and earth ponies came
together in friendship

04:42.816 --> 04:44.818
to defeat the Windigos!

04:44.852 --> 04:47.355
That silly legend
is the problem!

04:47.388 --> 04:50.491
Telling everypony that
singing songs and being nice

04:50.524 --> 04:53.861
will solve anything? I've
spent years studying magic

04:53.894 --> 04:56.430
and that's not how it works.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.832
I think you might be
missing the point.

04:58.866 --> 05:03.003
Work hard, learn and use your
skills to better Equestria.

05:03.036 --> 05:06.407
THAT'S a worthy
goal for anypony.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.410
But by all means, if you
want to go home early,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.745
ignore all of the work you
have and spend the rest --

05:11.779 --> 05:12.646
SWEET!

05:13.747 --> 05:15.015
Ugh.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.651
[cheers]

05:17.685 --> 05:20.354
I HATE Hearth's Warming Eve!

05:20.388 --> 05:22.456
All of Equestria
would be better off

05:22.490 --> 05:25.593
if we just skipped
the day all together.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.695
* "Happy Hearth's Warming"

05:27.728 --> 05:29.997
* They say in the street.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.999
* "Happy Hearth's Warming"

05:32.032 --> 05:34.134
* They think they're so sweet.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.703
* Words said so often

05:35.736 --> 05:37.838
* That they lack any meaning.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.507
* Why should I join in?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.775
* When I could be
intervening! *

05:41.809 --> 05:45.379
* Everypony loves
this cursed holiday *

05:45.413 --> 05:47.047
* but would they be better off

05:47.080 --> 05:49.717
* with it out of the way?

05:51.919 --> 05:57.391
* Well, OK.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.428
* Say goodbye to the holiday

06:00.461 --> 06:04.131
* With my magic
I'll erase it *

06:04.164 --> 06:07.100
* The greatest gift
that I give today *

06:07.134 --> 06:10.838
* And everypony will
have to face it. *

06:10.871 --> 06:17.845
* No more little games
for you to play *

06:17.878 --> 06:21.949
* After you say goodbye
to the holiday. *

06:21.982 --> 06:26.420
**

06:26.454 --> 06:28.121
* Goodbye Hearth's Warming

06:28.155 --> 06:29.823
* You had a good run

06:29.857 --> 06:31.625
* Goodbye Hearth's Warming

06:31.659 --> 06:33.494
* It's over, you're done

06:33.527 --> 06:35.062
* Finally set free from

06:35.095 --> 06:36.897
* your forced celebrations

06:36.930 --> 06:38.198
* no need to reply

06:38.231 --> 06:40.534
* to your trite invitations

06:40.568 --> 06:43.837
* Calendars shorter
by a single day *

06:43.871 --> 06:47.074
* Is my magic up to the test?

06:47.107 --> 06:51.879
* Time to see, I can't delay.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.715
**

06:54.748 --> 06:57.718
* Say goodbye to the holiday

06:57.751 --> 07:01.221
* Prepare the spell,
no hesitation *

07:01.254 --> 07:04.692
* All memories shall fade away

07:04.725 --> 07:08.562
* See Equestria's
new transformation *

07:08.596 --> 07:15.603
* No more shall any ponies say

07:16.103 --> 07:17.771
* "Happy Hearth's Warming"

07:17.805 --> 07:19.973
[cackles]

07:20.007 --> 07:24.945
* after today!

07:24.978 --> 07:27.881
**

07:27.915 --> 07:33.754
* After today.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.895
Once the spell is cast, all of
Equestria will be better off.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.498
And they'll have
me to thank for it!

07:44.532 --> 07:45.899
Wait a minute.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.035
Snowfall doesn't like
Hearth's Warming Eve

07:48.068 --> 07:51.672
so she decides to cast a spell
to get rid of it all together?

07:51.705 --> 07:54.742
That seems a little extreme.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.110
Says the pony who tried
to make everypony the same

07:57.144 --> 08:00.614
by replacing their cutie
marks with equal signs.

08:00.648 --> 08:04.618
I THINK what Spike is trying
to say is that everypony

08:04.652 --> 08:08.055
has their reasons for doing
things. Even Snowfall.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.090
And if I could
continue the story,

08:10.123 --> 08:12.192
we might just find
out what they are.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.127
Proceed.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.097
Snowfall was all set to cast
her spell that would erase

08:17.130 --> 08:19.667
Hearth's Warming
Eve for all time

08:19.700 --> 08:22.035
when a voice from the hearth
caught her attention.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.304
You SURE you wanna
go through with this?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.806
[gasp] Who's there!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.744
The Spirit of Hearth's
Warmin' Past, that's who.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.616
And you and me have got
to have us a little chat.

08:35.649 --> 08:40.220
A spirit! I didn't cast any
spirit-summoning spell.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.055
What are you doing here?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.257
You don't think a spell
like that would get by

08:44.291 --> 08:46.326
without some powerful
forces noticing?

08:46.359 --> 08:49.062
You've got our attention,
Snowfall Frost

08:49.096 --> 08:51.098
and we've got some
pretty strong opinions

08:51.131 --> 08:52.600
on this spell of yours.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.067
We?

08:54.101 --> 08:57.037
They'll be along in a bit.
For now it's just you and me.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.306
Let's get a move on.
We got a ton to see

08:59.339 --> 09:00.974
and barely any time
to see it.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.243
[laugh] I'm not
going anywhere.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.313
I've got a spell to cast. And
I don't need a history lesson

09:06.346 --> 09:08.616
about Hearth's Warming Eve.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.852
We aren't goin' to the past
to learn about the holiday.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.054
We're goin' to
learn about you.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.292
Whoa!

09:19.326 --> 09:21.695
* [strumming banjo]

09:21.729 --> 09:25.666
* As a young thing,
life sure is something *

09:25.699 --> 09:29.202
* You go makin' choices
large and small *

09:29.236 --> 09:31.805
* Always growing
like a seedling *

09:31.839 --> 09:33.874
* and playin' is
like dreaming *

09:33.907 --> 09:36.143
* And before you know
it big and tall. *

09:36.176 --> 09:40.080
*

09:40.113 --> 09:43.751
* And every little
bitty choice you make *

09:43.784 --> 09:48.255
* Sends you down a path
to who you are today *

09:48.288 --> 09:52.392
* So let's take a little
trip down memory lane *

09:52.425 --> 09:55.362
* And see just what
the past has to say. *

09:55.395 --> 09:58.198
**

09:58.231 --> 10:00.300
Awww, look how
cute you were.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.035
Looks like you're
not too upset it's

10:02.069 --> 10:04.037
Hearth's Warming Eve, either.

10:04.071 --> 10:08.375
* The seeds of the past,
they grow pretty fast *

10:08.408 --> 10:12.913
* Just look at who
you were back then *

10:12.946 --> 10:17.150
* The seeds as they grow,
look what they can show *

10:17.184 --> 10:20.353
* Reveal the truth
time and again *

10:26.894 --> 10:28.295
[British accent]

10:28.328 --> 10:31.398
Just what do you think
you are doing, Snowfall?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.366
Decorating the classroom
for Hearth's Warming Eve,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.435
Professor Flintheart!

10:35.468 --> 10:38.672
You said you wanted to learn
to be a powerful unicorn,

10:38.706 --> 10:41.074
did you not?
I do!

10:41.108 --> 10:44.978
And what is the way that one
becomes a powerful unicorn?

10:45.012 --> 10:48.048
[ahem] Work hard, learn
and use your skills

10:48.081 --> 10:49.416
to better Equestria.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.989
And how do these help
you to learn magic?

10:56.023 --> 10:59.292
I want to be strong enough to
stop Windigos and help ponies!

10:59.326 --> 11:02.830
That's just a story
we tell little ponies.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.998
Real magic takes
time to learn.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.399
[shatter]

11:09.169 --> 11:10.738
It's your choice.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.774
Spend your time learning to
become a powerful unicorn,

11:13.807 --> 11:17.811
or play with your toys and
make nothing of yourself.

11:17.845 --> 11:22.482
* Then some distress,
words so careless *

11:22.515 --> 11:26.954
* Standing there, you
don't know what to do *

11:26.987 --> 11:31.458
Feeling helpless,
can't make it hurt less

11:31.491 --> 11:36.363
* So you go and change
your point of view. *

11:36.396 --> 11:40.734
* And in that moment
though you didn't know it *

11:40.768 --> 11:45.105
* Your defenses set up
walls you built to last *

11:45.138 --> 11:49.142
* Leading to the pony
you've become today *

11:49.176 --> 11:51.411
* And the spell you're
about to cast, *

11:51.444 --> 11:54.948
* it all comes from your past.

11:54.982 --> 11:59.352
* The seeds of the past'
we grow up so fast *

11:59.386 --> 12:03.991
* Some hurts never go away

12:04.024 --> 12:08.295
* The seeds as they grow,
this we can't let go *

12:08.328 --> 12:12.065
* All tied to this one holiday

12:18.105 --> 12:20.207
[gasp] Spirit? What
am I supposed to--

12:24.211 --> 12:27.014
SNOWFALL FROST! IT IS I,

12:27.047 --> 12:31.151
THE SPIRIT OF HEARTH'S
WARMING PRESENTS!

12:31.184 --> 12:34.087
Um, don't you mean
present, like, the time?

12:34.121 --> 12:37.891
No. Toys, Hearth's Warming
dolls. Here! Want a cupcake?

12:37.925 --> 12:41.261
Fine. Presents. All of
the pointless things

12:41.294 --> 12:43.430
that ponies waste
their time on.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.366
Oh Snowfall. It's not what
the gift is that matters,

12:46.399 --> 12:48.869
it's what the gift MEANS!

12:48.902 --> 12:51.839
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just stuff.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.541
Exactly! Sometimes a
cupcake means I love you!

12:54.574 --> 12:56.877
Or a toy means Hi!
How ya doin?

12:56.910 --> 12:59.880
And sometimes a book means,
"Your mane looks AMAZING!"

12:59.913 --> 13:01.514
And sometimes a scarf means...

13:01.548 --> 13:03.917
well, a scarf usually
means you look cold.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.886
That one's easy.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.055
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.958
Whoa, whoa! [grunt]

13:10.991 --> 13:12.492
What's happening to you?

13:12.525 --> 13:15.428
My Spirit of Hearth's Warming
Presents-sense is going off!

13:15.462 --> 13:18.365
That means a song
is coming on!

13:19.967 --> 13:24.304
* [ragtime] *

13:24.337 --> 13:27.174
* Take a look at everything
* around you

13:27.207 --> 13:29.977
* All the smells that
surely will astound you *

13:30.010 --> 13:33.046
* Open up your heart;
it will surround you *

13:33.080 --> 13:35.849
* In the magic of
Hearth's Warming Eve *

13:35.883 --> 13:38.318
* The little things
that make it better *

13:38.351 --> 13:41.054
* Little ponies
spreading cheer! *

13:41.088 --> 13:43.891
* Give a toy, a hug, a sweater

13:43.924 --> 13:46.927
* Memories that last all year!

13:46.960 --> 13:49.462
* The present's always
filled with presents *

13:49.496 --> 13:52.065
* Large, medium and small

13:52.099 --> 13:54.902
* Sometimes the most
important things *

13:54.935 --> 13:57.604
* Aren't very big at all.

13:57.637 --> 14:04.844
* [tap shoes clicking]

14:08.015 --> 14:10.617
* What a party! There's
so much to see here! *

14:10.650 --> 14:13.353
* I can't believe you
didn't want to be here *

14:13.386 --> 14:16.256
* You would've had a
blast I guarantee here *

14:16.289 --> 14:19.159
* THIS is the spirit of
Hearth's Warming Eve! *

14:19.192 --> 14:21.962
* The cider's flowing,
this is living! *

14:21.995 --> 14:24.631
* Come on and feel the beat!

14:24.664 --> 14:27.434
* Life is better
when you're givin' *

14:27.467 --> 14:30.437
* Each time you do
it feels so sweet! *

14:30.470 --> 14:33.173
* The present's always
filled with presents *

14:33.206 --> 14:35.542
* So come on open your eyes

14:35.575 --> 14:38.311
* Spend time with
ponies just like you *

14:38.345 --> 14:41.414
* and watch your spirits rise

14:41.448 --> 14:44.251
* The present's always
filled with presents *

14:44.284 --> 14:46.653
* Take a look around

14:46.686 --> 14:49.322
* The reason for the holiday

14:49.356 --> 14:52.059
* is quite easily found

14:52.092 --> 14:59.099
* Yes the reason for the
holiday is quite easily found *

14:59.699 --> 15:02.102
* And the reason is to
be with your friends! *

15:03.003 --> 15:05.038
* And the reason is to
be with your friends! *

15:06.406 --> 15:07.674
What?

15:07.707 --> 15:10.543
You know you're doing your
Pinkie Pie voice, right?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.012
I was not...

15:12.045 --> 15:13.546
[laugh]

15:13.580 --> 15:16.984
So [sigh] what happens next?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.418
Well, the party was--

15:18.451 --> 15:20.320
WAIT! Can we take
a quick break?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.322
I need to refill my cocoa!

15:22.355 --> 15:25.025
[growl] Fine.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.926
But hurry up! We're
almost to the best part!

15:32.332 --> 15:34.667
OK. I'm ready.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.104
The party was in full swing.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.305
Snowdash!

15:38.338 --> 15:40.073
Hey, Merry.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.275
Why, whatever is
the matter, darling?

15:42.309 --> 15:44.011
Was it the eggnog?

15:44.044 --> 15:46.479
[sigh] I knew I put
in too much cinnamon.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.416
Oh, no! The eggnog was
awesome, Flutterholly.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.484
I'm just mad at somepony
who was complaining

15:51.518 --> 15:54.221
about how awful
Hearth's Warming Eve is.

15:54.254 --> 15:58.025
I don't suppose that pony's
name starts with "Snow"?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.260
And ends with "frost"?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.496
She said Hearth's Warming Eve
is just an excuse to party

16:03.530 --> 16:05.732
and we'd all be better
off spending time working

16:05.765 --> 16:08.035
to make Equestria
a better place.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.338
Boo!

16:11.371 --> 16:14.374
What does Snowfall think a
better Equestria looks like?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.143
Ponies working hard.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.577
Learning.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.213
And using their abilities for
the benefit of Equestria.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.314
[giggle]

16:23.083 --> 16:26.386
Yeah! [laugh] [cheers]

16:26.419 --> 16:29.122
It looks like we've got
everything on Snowfall's list

16:29.156 --> 16:30.623
right here.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.060
I think a perfect
Equestria looks a lot like

16:33.093 --> 16:34.694
a Hearth's Warming Eve party.

16:37.664 --> 16:42.402
Me too. Too bad it's going
to be the last one EVER!

16:42.435 --> 16:46.539
Ever...ever...ever.

16:46.573 --> 16:50.043
Spirit? What do you mean?
What's going to happen?

16:50.077 --> 16:57.084
[whistling wind]

16:58.151 --> 16:59.786
Who are you?

16:59.819 --> 17:03.590
I am the Spirit of Hearth's
Warming Yet to Come.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.392
Are you here to show me

17:05.425 --> 17:07.460
what future Hearth's
Warming Eves are like?

17:07.494 --> 17:10.697
No. For there are no more
Hearth's Warming Eves

17:10.730 --> 17:12.332
for me to show.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.766
Why not?

17:13.800 --> 17:18.205
You will succeed in erasing
the holiday as you wished.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.307
And what happens?

17:20.340 --> 17:26.846
* I see a cold wind
blowing through *

17:26.879 --> 17:33.253
* I see days neither
fun nor free *

17:33.286 --> 17:40.160
* I see a future
caused by you *

17:40.193 --> 17:46.233
* I see a path not
meant to be *

17:46.266 --> 17:52.205
* The future should
be filled with magic *

17:52.239 --> 17:59.112
* dreams and wishes
brought to life *

17:59.146 --> 18:05.652
* But the days ahead
are dark and tragic *

18:05.685 --> 18:12.659
* no time for hope
when all is strife *

18:12.692 --> 18:15.762
* Whatever might have been

18:15.795 --> 18:19.499
* all the dreams
that ponies share *

18:19.532 --> 18:22.502
* Because of you,
Snowfall Frost *

18:22.535 --> 18:26.573
* Now the future is
a cold nightmare *

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
WINDIGOS!? They
aren't real.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.477
It's just a little
filly's story!

18:30.510 --> 18:32.779
They are all too
real, Snowfall.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.815
And your actions will
allow them to return.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.651
The future of Equestria
shall be bathed in a blanket

18:38.685 --> 18:40.653
of eternal snow.

18:40.687 --> 18:44.657
No! I never meant for this to
happen. I didn't understand!

18:44.691 --> 18:47.660
I didn't see how important
Hearth's Warming Eve was!

18:47.694 --> 18:50.697
Please, spirit! I haven't
cast the spell yet!

18:50.730 --> 18:53.132
Is there still time?
I'm sorry!

19:04.644 --> 19:05.878
There's still time!

19:09.482 --> 19:10.517
Oh my.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.652
Snowfall Frost?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.721
I was hoping I wasn't
too late for the party.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.823
I brought gifts.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.526
[spits] Boss?

19:19.559 --> 19:22.529
I was wrong earlier. About
Hearth's Warming Eve.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.265
It's not all about
singing and presents.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.567
The singing and presents
are all about celebrating

19:27.600 --> 19:29.602
the ponies in our lives.

19:29.636 --> 19:33.340
The ponies we should listen
to more often. Our friends.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.344
Wow.

19:38.845 --> 19:43.283
Dragon toenail? Uh...thanks?

19:43.316 --> 19:46.586
I was in a hurry. I'll
do better next time.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.221
[laugh] You kidding?

19:48.255 --> 19:50.690
No one's ever given me
dragon toenail before!

19:50.723 --> 19:53.760
It's awesome! Now
come get some eggnog!

19:53.793 --> 19:55.928
And from then on it
was always said of all

19:55.962 --> 19:58.865
the Hearth's Warming
Eve celebrations,

19:58.898 --> 20:00.267
Snowfall's was the
Hearth's Warmingest.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.736
The end.

20:03.770 --> 20:07.407
Well, that's it. Thanks for
letting me read you the story.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.942
Guess you can call
it a night.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.345
Spike and I are
heading downstairs.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.647
And if you wanted to, you'd
be welcome to join us.

20:18.685 --> 20:23.556
[giggling]

20:23.590 --> 20:26.993
Welcome to the party. Happy
Hearth's Warming Starlight.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.762
Happy Hearth's
Warming, Twilight.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.865
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is filled with presents *

20:32.899 --> 20:36.035
* some take you by surprise

20:36.068 --> 20:39.472
* A story shared by
your good friends *

20:39.506 --> 20:42.509
* that makes your
spirits rise *

20:42.542 --> 20:45.645
* Sometimes you just
let go of the past *

20:45.678 --> 20:48.781
* enjoy the present
while it lasts *

20:48.815 --> 20:51.884
* And really it's not
that much to ask *

20:51.918 --> 20:54.587
* with good friends
by your side. *

20:54.621 --> 21:01.628
**

21:03.863 --> 21:05.832
* Now it's time to celebrate

21:05.865 --> 21:07.834
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again *

21:07.867 --> 21:09.836
* All together feeling great

21:09.869 --> 21:11.838
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again *

21:11.871 --> 21:13.840
* Can't hardly wait

21:13.873 --> 21:15.842
* We'll party till late

21:15.875 --> 21:17.944
* Our favorite date

21:17.977 --> 21:20.647
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *

21:20.680 --> 21:24.351
* Happy, Happy, Hearth's
Warming, *

21:24.384 --> 21:28.054
* Hearth's Warming Eve, Happy,
Happy, Hearth's Warming Eve. *

21:28.087 --> 21:31.491
* Hearth's Warming Eve
is here once again. *
