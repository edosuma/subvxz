WEBVTT

01:25.599 --> 01:28.000
You already know me
the public, give me the public,

01:28.040 --> 01:31.040
give me a stage and I sing to you
Whatever, you know what I tell you?

01:31.400 --> 01:32.560
Do not.

01:35.719 --> 01:38.480
I have not asked you.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.240
Andrew, have I asked you?

01:41.280 --> 01:42.359
I do not know.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.600
I do not care.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.400
The decision is final.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.319
Tonight you are going to announce it,

01:48.359 --> 01:51.359
you both go to work
together again as a team

01:51.400 --> 01:53.480
For me on my fucking station

01:56.040 --> 01:57.320
Do not even think about it.

01:57.879 --> 02:00.039
You smoke here all the time.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.600
What's this about, Norman?

02:02.840 --> 02:06.200
I have the best audience in years,
Better than when he was here.

02:07.319 --> 02:09.560
The world has changed
And we have to change.

02:09.598 --> 02:10.878
Gilipolleces.

02:11.159 --> 02:14.120
They kidnapped you, they beat you,
They burned your car.

02:14.159 --> 02:15.680
My old car

02:15.719 --> 02:17.800
They left it reduced to ashes.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.280
What more the fuck do you want?

02:20.919 --> 02:22.639
A little support would be fine.

02:22.879 --> 02:24.919
Look, your talk show,

02:24.960 --> 02:27.480
The Raw Reality is over.

02:28.159 --> 02:30.359
People are afraid,

02:30.400 --> 02:34.159
the technicians, the producers,
The journalists, the collaborators.

02:34.199 --> 02:37.039
I have a pile of resignations
in my table. They are cushioned.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.040
Anthony is the only one
That has not left.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.240
Don't put Anthony in this.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.840
We were great, uncle.

02:43.479 --> 02:46.159
He knows we worked
very good together.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.199
Oh yeah?
Until you screwed everything up.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.520
Don't take it with him
I may be your only friend.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.479
I'd rather have my teeth ripped off
to interview more celebrities.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.560
It's okay!

02:55.520 --> 02:58.960
Do not do it.
But don't broadcast that interview.

03:00.199 --> 03:01.639
You can't uncle

03:01.919 --> 03:03.159
People are already fed up.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.719
Brexit

03:04.759 --> 03:08.199
"Brexit this, Brexit the other ...
We're leaving, we're staying. "

03:09.080 --> 03:10.520
Gilipolleces.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.360
They need some joy.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.840
What they want is to have fun,
They need "the harsh reality."

03:17.879 --> 03:20.199
Voucher? You and me.

03:20.599 --> 03:23.560
In addition, it will be the end of your career.

03:23.599 --> 03:25.919
No, just the end of lies.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.080
Are you sure
What is at stake here?

03:30.120 --> 03:31.400
For you?

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
Very well.

03:34.439 --> 03:36.120
Let's calm down.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.160
Let 'me help you.

03:40.319 --> 03:41.319
Your?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.200
Come on, don't fuck me ...

03:44.919 --> 03:46.479
Ok, Jarvis, it's fine.

03:46.879 --> 03:48.120
Jarvis!

03:48.159 --> 03:51.639
Under your contract with BOD,
you have freedom of expression,

03:51.680 --> 03:53.920
But you don't have my support.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.520
If something happens, it will be your fault.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.519
Think wisely.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.640
You should have consulted me first.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.319
That is a yes?

04:10.840 --> 04:11.840
It is a "can."

04:12.840 --> 04:14.840
With that I am worth it
Let's have a drink.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.759
A quick one, before the program.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.519
Get ready, we enter at 22.00.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.560
Do not.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.918
- Will enter at 23.00.
- Well, at 23.00.

04:22.759 --> 04:23.959
Do not be late.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.080
Enjoy it.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
I'm sorry, Anthony.

05:54.199 --> 05:55.199
Where were you?

05:55.240 --> 05:56.680
Above.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.760
Will Andrew be on the show?

05:59.120 --> 06:00.240
How the fuck ...?

06:00.279 --> 06:03.759
Every time Andrew Wilde comes here
It's hard not to notice.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.439
You are going to tell me.

06:05.759 --> 06:08.639
Itâ€™s part of your story,
what are you going to do, right?

06:16.399 --> 06:19.039
The great Samuel S.,
That will be with you tonight.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.240
Do not miss it

06:20.279 --> 06:23.079
at the furry costume party
of the Borderline.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.439
If you have other plans,
You better cancel them.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.680
And we are out.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.960
BOD Radio, in 99.9 of your FM.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Go for them, uncle.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.840
The best debates ...

06:43.879 --> 06:45.360
I forgot...

06:45.399 --> 06:47.079
This is for you.
Julia has brought it.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.120
At the right time.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.080
Is he over here?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.280
He went to your office
About five minutes ago.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.800
It's 21.50, let's go
with today's headlines ...

06:54.839 --> 06:56.399
What does this do in my study?

06:56.439 --> 06:58.879
You know right now
We are stinky.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
The fucking door!

07:01.040 --> 07:03.439
I had to put
in the 21.00 program.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.439
Connected with London.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.735
US security agents UU.
They have accused the United Kingdom ...

07:06.759 --> 07:08.039
Jarvis!

07:08.680 --> 07:12.120
This guy ...
This guy is very good.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.879
If you neglect,
It will leave you without a program.

07:15.279 --> 07:17.199
Good job, see you at the party.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.480
With a salary of 99,000 pounds,
has submitted his resignation,

07:20.519 --> 07:23.479
and assumes full responsibility
in the scandal ...

07:23.519 --> 07:25.399
Fuck, where did you get it from?

07:25.439 --> 07:26.759
It is useless.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.199
He has no idea, but he dies
for working with you, so ...

07:30.240 --> 07:32.400
- What was it called?
- Claire.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
Claire!

07:34.720 --> 07:36.480
Welcome to La Cruda Reality.

07:36.519 --> 07:39.039
I've been here two months, Mr. Dolan.

07:39.839 --> 07:40.839
I know.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.280
Call me Jarvis.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.519
This is the last one.

07:49.839 --> 07:52.119
Oh yes, the webcams do not work.

07:52.160 --> 07:52.920
Again?

07:52.959 --> 07:55.799
I know. A technician will come.
Claire has already notified.

07:55.839 --> 07:57.399
Do you have the interview ready?

07:57.439 --> 07:59.079
- Phil Collins has it.
- What?

08:00.079 --> 08:02.800
Norman hates Phil Collins,
It won't occur to you to look here.

08:02.839 --> 08:03.599
Cool.

08:03.639 --> 08:05.360
But the sound is crap.

08:05.399 --> 08:07.319
He was wearing a mic, what did you expect?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.800
I don't know if you're brave or stupid,

08:09.839 --> 08:12.919
But this is going to be the bomb, my friend.
What will I know?

08:13.519 --> 08:15.120
Are you preparing the intro for Andrew?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.920
- Where are you going now?
- Give me two minutes.

08:17.959 --> 08:20.039
With you it's always two minutes.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.640
Two minutes, some balls.

08:23.519 --> 08:25.799
Come on, Samuel, uncle!

08:26.120 --> 08:29.240
Fuck, every week the same.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.000
Lazy bastard.

09:00.279 --> 09:02.839
BODY STAR SEQUESTED,
JARVIS DOLAN

09:35.039 --> 09:36.360
Your father is there.

09:37.759 --> 09:40.879
This site is amazing!
Why hadn't I seen it before?

09:41.720 --> 09:42.720
Any problem?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.320
Oh no.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.360
I leave you both.

09:46.399 --> 09:48.559
Have you seen how you left my office?

09:48.600 --> 09:51.639
Yes. I pick it up right now.

09:51.679 --> 09:53.559
Do you think this is a good idea?

09:53.600 --> 09:56.279
After what happened
the last weekend?

09:56.320 --> 09:58.200
Julia, that kid is asshole.

09:58.519 --> 10:01.519
It is I who decides
If Sam is an asshole or not.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.920
Listen, I don't want to talk about it now.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.160
Very well, go and order my office
and I will talk to him.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.679
And crap.
I know you.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.560
I'm going to the Borderline party,
even...

10:14.600 --> 10:18.040
I have never endured that you do that,
Not even with five years.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.840
It's okay.

10:21.039 --> 10:22.159
It's okay.

10:23.279 --> 10:25.120
Let's take a picture.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.519
Thank you.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.440
Party!

10:33.480 --> 10:35.920
I will pick up the office.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.000
See you later?

10:38.039 --> 10:39.159
Very well.

10:41.159 --> 10:42.519
See you later.

10:45.559 --> 10:47.759
What torments you, Jarvis?

10:47.799 --> 10:50.319
I know Norman believes
that you have a flower in the ass,

10:50.360 --> 10:52.960
but I will do everything I can
to get kicked out of here

10:53.000 --> 10:54.919
Uncle, what the hell have I done to you?

10:54.960 --> 10:58.160
I got you, you're not anymore
than a cool cocaineman.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.400
What do you want?

10:59.440 --> 11:02.560
I know that the nihilistic pose
and back from everything Julia

11:02.600 --> 11:05.720
It is attractive,
but she is a very cheerful girl,

11:05.759 --> 11:07.720
and full of life.

11:08.159 --> 11:12.000
I don't want to see her depressed
and disappointed because of you.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.960
So you are going to the party
to become the rock star

11:16.000 --> 11:17.639
and then you will bring it to me here

11:17.679 --> 11:19.919
before my program ends,
it is understood?

11:21.519 --> 11:23.639
Now be a good boy and say "Yes."

11:24.279 --> 11:25.319
Yes.

11:27.159 --> 11:29.079
Great, have fun.

11:41.919 --> 11:45.719
Unstoppable, idealistic,
and totally independent.

11:46.919 --> 11:48.039
Discover The Raw Reality.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.495
I have to change the damn intro.

11:49.519 --> 11:52.759
In 5, 4, 3, 2 ...

11:55.159 --> 11:58.120
The concept of "post-truth"
it has become so popular

11:58.159 --> 12:02.159
which is now totally acceptable
deny or ridicule the facts.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.440
Above all, if those facts
They don't match what you think.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.920
As individuals, we are incapable
to evaluate the consequences.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.800
If it seems good to you, you do it and that's it.
Who cares about the facts?

12:13.399 --> 12:16.240
I care.
These are the facts.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.320
This is the truth:

12:18.360 --> 12:21.159
three days ago, some fascist thugs,
patriotic assumptions,

12:21.200 --> 12:24.600
they kidnapped me, they burned my car
and threatened my family

12:24.639 --> 12:28.559
for not respecting
"the will of the people".

12:28.600 --> 12:30.159
I get it.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.400
All this year
I have not stopped talking

12:32.440 --> 12:35.560
of Russian interference
in the Brexit process,

12:35.600 --> 12:37.960
about the secret motives
of the billionaires

12:38.000 --> 12:41.080
who want to convert this country
In a tax haven.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.120
But Russia's intervention

12:43.159 --> 12:44.959
he didn't give himself
in the conference rooms,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.440
in the rich clubs
or in think tanks.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.800
I was in the streets,
in the pubs, on the terraces

12:51.840 --> 12:54.680
and orchestrated in social networks.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.279
I was in the Facebook post
of the young woman with the handkerchief,

12:58.320 --> 13:00.960
right after the attack
to the London bridge,

13:01.200 --> 13:04.520
when they told you I was
planning the next attack,

13:04.559 --> 13:09.399
when I really just called
to his mother to tell him he was fine.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.320
It's the voice in your head that tells you

13:11.360 --> 13:14.560
that there are too many brown faces
in the doctor's room,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.639
when the doctors really are
and immigrant nurses

13:17.679 --> 13:20.319
those who hold
Our Social Security

13:20.879 --> 13:24.039
The alleged "manifestations
voluntary and spontaneous ",

13:24.080 --> 13:26.440
so acclaimed by the right press

13:26.480 --> 13:30.159
as examples of the population
native of the United Kingdom

13:30.200 --> 13:32.120
I was regaining control,

13:32.159 --> 13:35.879
they were another sample of the intervention
of Russia in the elections.

13:35.919 --> 13:38.879
They have not only sown
the controversy and division,

13:38.919 --> 13:42.759
have financed
To thugs and murderers.

13:42.799 --> 13:47.719
The same thugs
that have threatened me and my family.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.320
I apologize in advance

13:51.360 --> 13:54.120
because of the poor sound quality
of this recording.

13:56.399 --> 13:58.000
But that's what there is.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.520
They can hate me

13:59.559 --> 14:02.359
shout to the radio, if you want,

14:02.919 --> 14:05.159
But this is the world we live in.

14:17.159 --> 14:19.719
It seems we have
audio issues,

14:19.759 --> 14:21.840
while we solve it,

14:21.879 --> 14:24.200
let's take a look
to hate mails,

14:24.240 --> 14:27.680
emails that prove my theory
that you only listen to the program

14:27.720 --> 14:29.240
To piss you off and hate me.

14:29.279 --> 14:32.879
The first one comes
from chupamela@yahoo.com.

14:32.919 --> 14:34.599
Yes, "suck me."

14:34.639 --> 14:37.399
This guy tells me:
"The good people of England

14:37.440 --> 14:40.360
you have the right to defend
our borders and our children,

14:40.399 --> 14:43.480
England first,
you are a jerk, liberal of the ... "

14:43.519 --> 14:46.240
Not even me
I can say that word here.

14:46.279 --> 14:47.559
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:47.600 --> 14:48.855
"If you hate this country, go to another,

14:48.879 --> 14:50.559
Do you know what they want to snatch from us?

14:50.600 --> 14:54.320
This is not going to end well for anyone,
stop doing the jerk

14:54.360 --> 14:57.960
and dedicate yourself better to fuck celebrities

14:58.000 --> 14:59.240
as you always have ... "

14:59.279 --> 15:00.199
Shit!

15:00.240 --> 15:02.320
That's bullshit!

15:02.360 --> 15:05.639
The celebrities are ruined
Life alone.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.360
And this was the last email,

15:23.399 --> 15:26.519
If this is all the hate you have,
God help us.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.679
And now, "Gimme Shelter",
I think I earned it.

15:32.080 --> 15:36.240
Hey, I think I had patience,
If this is a joke, it's time to ...

15:37.320 --> 15:39.135
Our expert
in London nightlife ...

15:39.159 --> 15:40.519
What's up, Anthony?

15:40.559 --> 15:42.375
- The radio star ...
- This is a sauna.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.120
- DJ and producer Samuel S ...
- Anthony.

15:44.159 --> 15:45.759
Damn you!

15:45.799 --> 15:47.240
Let them give you an ass!

15:57.759 --> 15:59.039
Anthony!

15:59.320 --> 16:00.680
Open the door.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.600
BOD Radio, in 99.9 of your FM.

16:05.639 --> 16:06.360
Fuck!

16:06.639 --> 16:10.000
The best debates,
from London to the world.

16:11.039 --> 16:11.919
At the right time.

16:11.960 --> 16:12.720
Anthony!

16:12.759 --> 16:14.360
In BOD Radio.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.600
We're safe?

16:25.039 --> 16:27.319
Could we commit a crime
and go unpunished?

16:27.360 --> 16:31.680
Ron Hogg chat with the head of security
and law enforcement, Sophie Lippmann.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.920
Voucher!
I'm leaving it!

16:37.159 --> 16:38.399
I'm leaving it!

16:47.279 --> 16:48.480
Anthony

16:49.200 --> 16:51.120
Anthony, what's going on?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.440
Anthony?

17:01.720 --> 17:05.240
First,
you will continue with the program,

17:05.279 --> 17:07.039
normally.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.638
Second,

17:10.680 --> 17:13.240
you will follow our instructions

17:13.279 --> 17:15.519
Without asking questions.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.599
I will not do that.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.000
Turn on the lights
And open the fucking door!

17:22.400 --> 17:23.839
By last,

17:23.880 --> 17:27.359
yes for any reason
the broadcast is cut,

17:28.160 --> 17:30.560
You are going to pay dearly.

17:30.599 --> 17:33.480
You and these two here.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.399
Open the fucking door!

17:57.519 --> 17:59.359
Sit down, we enter the antenna.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.640
No ... I don't hear you. Cone!

18:06.799 --> 18:09.279
Sit down, Dolan, we get on the antenna.

18:09.319 --> 18:10.879
Fuck you!

18:11.200 --> 18:12.480
No no no!

18:12.519 --> 18:13.559
No no no!

18:13.599 --> 18:16.240
Do not! Do not touch him!

18:16.519 --> 18:19.559
- No, no, please!
- Let go, don't touch him!

18:19.599 --> 18:21.879
- I have done what you asked me!
- Do not!

18:22.720 --> 18:25.240
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming!

18:28.960 --> 18:31.799
We can understand each other, okay?
I'm already sitting

18:31.839 --> 18:34.879
Anthony, calm down.
Quiet, okay?

18:34.920 --> 18:36.160
Anthony, calm down.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.279
We're going to get on the antenna, get ready.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.240
What have you done to the girl?
I want to see.

18:42.279 --> 18:44.119
- Starts...
- I want to see the girl.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.920
Start apologizing
for technical problems

18:46.960 --> 18:49.120
and explains that everything
It is solved. Then...

18:49.160 --> 18:51.640
- Is this for the recording?
- What the fuck ...!

18:51.680 --> 18:54.720
This is much more important.
Fuck the recording!

18:55.599 --> 18:57.159
You better start, Dolan,

18:57.200 --> 19:01.080
Or I swear I'll kill them both.
It is understood?

19:01.880 --> 19:03.160
IN ANTENNA - MICRO OPEN

19:04.319 --> 19:07.200
Two armed men have taken
the station and they have us withheld.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.559
We are in study 1 ...

19:08.599 --> 19:11.480
It's 21.50, we start
with the most outstanding news,

19:11.519 --> 19:14.000
from the news agency
of BOD Radio.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.359
At the right time, in BOD Radio.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.240
Trump's team criticizes the fixation
of England with Brexit,

19:23.279 --> 19:26.079
and EE. UU sanctions Russian bankers
connected with London ...

19:26.119 --> 19:27.719
U.S. security officers UU ...

19:28.880 --> 19:30.000
Fuck!

19:30.680 --> 19:32.240
Fuck!

19:33.480 --> 19:34.480
Do not!

19:35.079 --> 19:36.079
Do not!

19:36.640 --> 19:37.759
Shit.

19:37.799 --> 19:39.480
Fuck!

19:45.400 --> 19:47.360
Let go of me, hell ...!

19:52.640 --> 19:56.400
You have already understood the message!
We need him.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.160
This was the last email,

20:27.200 --> 20:31.080
If this is all the hate you have for me,
God help us.

20:31.119 --> 20:34.119
And now "Gimme Shelter",
I think I earned it.

20:34.559 --> 20:36.759
The program is broadcast with a delay.

20:36.799 --> 20:40.799
We were prepared for this shit,
Who do you take us for?

20:44.559 --> 20:47.559
Put on your helmets,
Let's start again.

21:06.039 --> 21:07.519
For good nutrition.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.799
Eat or not eat?

21:10.440 --> 21:11.960
Every Saturday at 2pm.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.480
At the right time.

21:15.519 --> 21:17.639
What is this?
What do you want?

21:20.440 --> 21:21.680
What's this about?

21:21.720 --> 21:24.440
Idealistic
and totally independent.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.880
You are on antenna.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.240
Discover The Crude Reality ...

21:28.680 --> 21:31.000
with Jarvis Dolan.

21:34.079 --> 21:37.480
We apologize
for technical problems ...

21:37.519 --> 21:39.519
Control yourself and don't fuck it.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.519
And the failures
at the beginning of the program ...

21:41.559 --> 21:43.599
You're not doing well, Dolan, calm down,

21:43.640 --> 21:46.840
at least pretend
that you are the fucking Jarvis Dolan.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.320
Let's go again.

21:50.279 --> 21:53.759
Unstoppable, idealistic
and totally independent.

21:54.759 --> 21:56.839
Again, Dolan.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.080
The Raw Reality, with Jarvis Dolan.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.480
From what we see
on the program's Twitter,

22:04.519 --> 22:07.839
the listeners have not been indifferent
to the chaos of tonight,

22:07.880 --> 22:11.040
but this is what happens
with the live,

22:11.079 --> 22:13.720
that's how live programs are,

22:13.759 --> 22:17.920
and if someone asks
how is something like that possible,

22:17.960 --> 22:22.480
you can see the ceremony again
of the Oscar 2017 on YouTube.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.720
So the idea that someone

22:40.759 --> 22:45.519
can fully control
his image is a utopia and ...

22:45.559 --> 22:47.639
Now introduce Andrew.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.039
It's almost ...

22:51.440 --> 22:54.600
it's almost 23.00 and it's time
of introducing Andrew Wilde.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.759
We will do it with,
in his own words,

22:56.799 --> 22:59.039
one of my favorite subjects
of all times.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.440
This makes no sense.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.559
Andrew has nothing to do with this.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.360
If you don't tell me
what's this going on I'm not going to ...

23:10.400 --> 23:12.600
You stick to the script.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.000
- I want to talk to Anthony.
- You're not in command anymore.

23:16.039 --> 23:19.240
Whatever you have planned,

23:19.960 --> 23:23.519
it will be much faster and easier
if you tell me, so ...

23:26.039 --> 23:27.680
I just want to know if it's ok.

23:30.319 --> 23:31.559
Hears,

23:31.599 --> 23:34.559
we all want this to end
as soon as possible.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.440
Do you hear me?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.440
Do you hear me?

23:52.839 --> 23:55.399
Oh no, honey.
You are not alone.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.720
You look at yourself
But you are very unfair.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.160
You have a head make a mess,

24:03.200 --> 24:06.559
but if I could get
that you care

24:07.000 --> 24:10.559
Oh no, honey.
You are not alone.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.559
What the hell happened here?

24:13.680 --> 24:14.920
But what the fuck ...?

24:15.599 --> 24:16.679
Got it now.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.319
Did they hurt you?
You're good?

24:18.359 --> 24:21.919
Have you ridden a party
while mom and dad bear weren't?

24:22.279 --> 24:24.599
Hey you blonde!

24:25.000 --> 24:26.640
I'm going to ask you two things.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.519
Lower the fucking heat

24:28.559 --> 24:31.079
and bring me a glass of cold water
with two slits of lime.

24:31.119 --> 24:32.639
Lima, not lemon!

24:34.160 --> 24:35.360
Jarv!

24:35.599 --> 24:36.719
What?

24:37.079 --> 24:39.119
What's going on here, uncle?

24:39.400 --> 24:42.519
What happened here?
The host!

24:44.759 --> 24:46.359
Where is Anthony?
I will talk to him.

24:46.599 --> 24:49.559
No, no, Andrew, Andrew, listen to me.

24:49.599 --> 24:50.719
Listen out.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.720
Sit down.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.519
Anthony is preparing the program.

24:54.559 --> 24:57.319
It will be a matter of a minute.
We will enter antenna.

24:57.359 --> 24:58.399
Let's go.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.320
What's going on, Jarv?

25:01.839 --> 25:04.199
What's going on here, uncle?

25:04.240 --> 25:05.839
Something is happening,

25:05.880 --> 25:08.400
because the piba that
He seems to have seen a fucking ghost.

25:12.839 --> 25:15.679
And you, trunk, you look bad.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.559
The study is a mess.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.559
What's going on, uncle?
Tell me

25:21.599 --> 25:25.879
It's that Samuel brought Die Antwoord
last week and rode a good one.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.960
- Y...
- The Ninja.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.960
And I screwed my knee ...

25:31.440 --> 25:33.360
But it doesn't matter, right?

25:33.400 --> 25:35.320
"The show must continue," right?

25:35.599 --> 25:38.799
- You haven't learned anything from me?
- You're right.

25:38.839 --> 25:42.599
Why didn't you tell me about the Ninja?
Having said it before, man.

25:43.319 --> 25:46.439
This is going to be more cool

25:47.240 --> 25:50.920
that Iggy Pop walking
about the public in Cincinnati.

25:51.599 --> 25:55.919
I'm glad you shot that recording
to the trash, that's where it should be.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.240
Leave the Brexit of the balls.

25:58.279 --> 25:59.519
And I apologize.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.599
Norman is a liant, we know that.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.960
He hooked me in the elevator
and 15 min later you stick a knife.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.039
But what happened to you
in the hand? I shit on ...!

26:09.079 --> 26:10.759
I will clean in the ads.

26:13.279 --> 26:14.879
Are you okay uncle

26:15.440 --> 26:18.920
Is that ... all this ...
You're good?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.960
I met Andrew
Will it be about 15 years ago?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.319
It was in a demonstration
Against abortion

26:25.359 --> 26:28.240
This guy appeared covered in blood
with a sign that said:

26:28.279 --> 26:30.279
"You should have killed me
when you could. "

26:30.319 --> 26:32.879
I do not know yet
If my posture is clear.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.560
It seemed very subtle to me, Andrew.

26:35.599 --> 26:38.839
Then I realized
that he was a rival journalist

26:38.880 --> 26:40.160
Covering that story.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.160
And that's how love was born, friends.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.759
It was then that I realized
That we could work together.

26:45.799 --> 26:47.519
If you managed to handle me ...

26:47.559 --> 26:50.399
If I could infuse him
A little common sense.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.799
Exact. And you know
I think that picture of me

26:53.839 --> 26:56.559
it's out there somewhere
floating in the ether.

26:56.599 --> 26:58.879
It may have become a meme.

26:58.920 --> 27:02.160
Why don't we search on Google,
live, right here?

27:02.200 --> 27:03.559
Check it out for yourself.

27:03.599 --> 27:05.199
ANDREW WILDE PROTEST ANTIABORTO

27:05.240 --> 27:07.240
All our listeners
under 100 years

27:07.279 --> 27:11.160
They know what we are talking about.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.759
It seems we have
technical difficulties in the study.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.039
If you touch that mobile,
I cut your hand.

27:19.079 --> 27:21.720
Keep it up,
In an hour everything will be over.

27:21.759 --> 27:24.599
You will continue with the interview,
Act normal.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.200
If that clown tries to leave,
You are both dead.

27:27.240 --> 27:30.680
Just wait for my instructions.
Raise your hand if you have understood me.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.839
And know well, the most important.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.680
I will not pretend or deny ...

27:34.720 --> 27:37.839
I would like to talk about something
We've never talked before

27:37.880 --> 27:40.360
our first year
in The Raw Reality.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.840
- The program was very successful.
- Yes.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.280
- We could say it was ...
- Like a shot ...

27:46.319 --> 27:48.599
Yes, like a shot.
What did that mean to you?

27:48.640 --> 27:52.600
For me...
I don't think about it much, really.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.960
I am an uncle
With feet on the ground.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.319
But like you, both of you,

27:57.359 --> 28:00.000
we became famous
From overnight.

28:00.039 --> 28:03.240
As if from nothing, you wake up
And you are famous. What are you going to do?

28:03.279 --> 28:06.839
You already know that fame is
A huge and hungry monster.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.759
We are roasting live
Tonight in the studio, literally.

28:42.359 --> 28:43.559
Dolan

28:43.880 --> 28:48.160
Before the announcements I want to talk
November 2011, in Belfast.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.280
Do what I say
Or I chop the girl

28:52.920 --> 28:56.960
Now I want to talk about something
So I feel a special affection.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.160
It's about the last night
that we work together,

29:00.200 --> 29:04.559
It was our last broadcast,
at the European MTV awards in 2017.

29:04.599 --> 29:06.679
The EMA, Jarv,

29:06.720 --> 29:09.400
That's what they call them, the EMA.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.160
Lady Gaga's night ...

29:11.200 --> 29:15.000
What happened at the party after,
at the Hotel Europa?

29:15.039 --> 29:17.119
Running on stage.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.120
I remember it well, how about you?

29:19.160 --> 29:20.200
Hello?

29:20.680 --> 29:22.880
What are you looking at?
What do you do?

29:22.920 --> 29:24.640
Stop looking there
and do the program.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.720
Come on, Jarvis, ask him what happened

29:26.759 --> 29:28.799
at the Europa Hotel party.

29:28.839 --> 29:31.799
Do you remember there
a party later? You remember?

29:31.839 --> 29:34.639
If I remember...?
All of Belfast was a party.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.120
The party at the Europa Hotel.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.775
All bars, discos
and open restaurants ...

29:38.799 --> 29:41.960
No, the party at the Europa Hotel.
Do you remember that party?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.160
One more party.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.360
He took two girls to his room.
Ask him what happened there.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.200
The two girls that went with you,
those of the party.

29:50.920 --> 29:55.160
I'm sorry, Jarv.
I don't think ... I don't know if ...

29:56.279 --> 29:57.839
What do you intend to do to me?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.560
Ask him a whore once,
What did he do with them?

30:01.359 --> 30:04.000
Jarvis, they're pointing at me
With a gun in the head.

30:04.039 --> 30:06.279
What the hell happened in room 221?

30:06.319 --> 30:07.519
Is going to kill me. Please...

30:07.559 --> 30:08.919
Ask him a whore once,

30:08.960 --> 30:10.480
What did he do to them?

30:10.519 --> 30:12.759
Ask him what happened
in room 221.

30:12.799 --> 30:16.399
Andrew what did you do to them
to the girls in room 221?

30:26.640 --> 30:28.920
Stay with us
the next four hours

30:28.960 --> 30:32.160
and listen to the Crude Reality
with Jarvis Dolan.

30:32.799 --> 30:35.240
You are amazing.

30:36.880 --> 30:37.960
Really.

30:39.559 --> 30:41.399
Are you going to do this to me?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.640
Live, on antenna?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.839
You start talking about that night ...

30:49.240 --> 30:50.279
Why?

30:50.759 --> 30:53.599
Well, I don't understand, uncle.

30:54.359 --> 30:56.279
What are you talking about?

30:56.920 --> 30:58.880
What the hell is going on?

30:59.279 --> 31:01.839
What the hell is going on?
Here something happens.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.000
Why are you doing this to me?
Dumbass.

31:11.039 --> 31:13.480
Do not let us in there.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.960
Make him calm down
And it feels again.

31:19.599 --> 31:22.039
- I can not believe it!
- Sit down, calm down. Sit down.

31:22.079 --> 31:23.960
- Live?
- No, sit down.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.640
- I'm your colleague.
- Sit down.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.120
- We're supposed to be colleagues.
- Please sit.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.360
Why do you have to wear
to talk about that night? Why?

31:33.400 --> 31:35.920
What about? Why?

31:35.960 --> 31:37.440
Sit down, come on.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.000
We had already buried that shit.

31:39.039 --> 31:41.079
Shut up and sit down!

31:41.119 --> 31:42.919
Let them give you an ass!

31:43.480 --> 31:45.079
Andrew, you have to tell it.

31:45.119 --> 31:47.000
Tell him to calm down, Dolan.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.200
Now they will judge and sentence you ...

31:49.240 --> 31:52.720
- Shut up, okay!
- Calm down and sit down again.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.759
Let him sit down again, host!

31:56.000 --> 31:57.960
- Sit down and we'll talk about it.
- Do not!

32:04.559 --> 32:07.039
That feels to me ... the balls.

32:07.079 --> 32:09.319
Sit down and calm down.

32:09.359 --> 32:11.279
I'm going to smoke a cigarette.

32:11.319 --> 32:13.879
I tell you one thing, I leave.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.039
Stay here.

32:15.079 --> 32:17.399
Andrew, stay here and sit down.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.440
Do not open that door.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.720
You can get
Your program in the ass.

32:21.759 --> 32:22.759
Andrew, stay ...

32:27.759 --> 32:29.440
And now what, Jarv?

32:29.680 --> 32:32.720
Is this a convention
The Lord of the fucking rings?

32:32.759 --> 32:35.240
Are you fucking or what?

32:35.279 --> 32:36.599
Is it the fucking Halloween?

32:37.039 --> 32:38.879
What's up, trunk?

32:38.920 --> 32:41.039
Get out of there, fucking clown.

32:41.079 --> 32:42.559
No no no!

32:42.599 --> 32:43.359
No Please!

32:43.400 --> 32:46.759
- He's going to sit, go.
- You're a crazy freak. What the fuck ...?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.639
Get up from there.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.840
Let go of me, Jarvis!

32:53.319 --> 32:54.319
Do not!

32:54.599 --> 32:56.119
Enough, don't hit him anymore.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.480
My hand, fuck!

33:01.319 --> 33:02.879
Fuck Jarv!

33:03.200 --> 33:05.000
- Jarvis!
- Chill chill.

33:05.039 --> 33:07.200
I swear I'll do
it feels.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.519
He is going to sit.

33:08.559 --> 33:09.480
Fuck you!

33:09.519 --> 33:11.319
Ok, ok, it's going to sit.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
Fuck.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.279
Quiet.

33:16.319 --> 33:19.079
Ok, ok, that's it, that's it.

33:19.119 --> 33:20.559
You're good?

33:20.599 --> 33:21.639
Very well.

33:22.319 --> 33:24.000
Get me out of here, Jarv.

33:24.039 --> 33:26.839
We have to take him to a hospital.
They have to see that.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.680
Shut! It's all your fault.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.360
I told you to calm him down and sit down.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.880
That bastard raped the girls.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.560
You have to tell us what happened,

33:34.599 --> 33:38.079
if you get me to say it live,
I'll call an ambulance.

33:38.119 --> 33:39.799
But let this mischief take off,

33:39.839 --> 33:42.759
if you remain unconscious,
You can go forgetting, tell him.

33:42.799 --> 33:45.079
Who the hell are these guys?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.240
Listen to me.

33:48.279 --> 33:49.279
Andrew, listen to me.

33:49.319 --> 33:50.839
Listen, listen to me well.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.000
Listen to me. Look at me, you look at me
There are two men.

33:54.039 --> 33:57.399
Two men have taken the study,
Claire and Anthony are kidnapped.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.200
What?

33:58.240 --> 34:00.880
They want you to say what happened
in room 221.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.080
- Why?
- Live.

34:02.119 --> 34:02.879
I do not know.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.759
We are stuck here with them.
Listen out.

34:05.799 --> 34:08.518
Everything they've told me
what they would do, they have done it

34:08.559 --> 34:11.880
And they have promised me to ask
An ambulance if you confess live.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.679
- It's okay.
- Voucher?

34:13.719 --> 34:15.639
Very well. Voucher...

34:19.559 --> 34:21.639
What do I have to confess?

34:21.679 --> 34:24.239
What happened there.
You know what happened.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.760
Discover The Raw Reality.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.920
I can not talk about that.

34:31.119 --> 34:32.159
Jarv

34:33.920 --> 34:36.518
The reason why this program
he is so famous

34:36.559 --> 34:39.679
it's because of the unexpected turns
that happen here every moment.

34:39.719 --> 34:42.079
The public of the program
It has a lot to contribute,

34:42.119 --> 34:44.920
Your feedback is very important.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.800
A reliable source has launched

34:46.840 --> 34:50.079
serious accusations tonight
against Andrew Wilde.

34:50.119 --> 34:51.599
Andrew.

34:53.599 --> 34:55.279
Let's take a look at Twitter.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.880
We have Johnny
from Kennington that tells us:

34:57.920 --> 35:01.119
"Famous and alcohol,
a lethal combination. "

35:01.159 --> 35:04.079
Yes, you're right, Johnny.
I think Andrew alone

35:04.119 --> 35:06.880
I was fooling around with the grupis.

35:07.559 --> 35:08.599
Yes.

35:09.199 --> 35:10.759
Partying.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.200
Yes. You see, Andrew, the truth

35:13.239 --> 35:15.199
In the end, it is not objective.

35:15.239 --> 35:18.959
Each fact has different versions,
depending on the actor.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.719
You just have to tell us
Your version of the story.

35:24.519 --> 35:26.440
Andrew, say something.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.199
It does not matter what you say,
It will not be valid in court.

35:29.239 --> 35:30.695
- Why do you want me to talk?
- I do not know.

35:30.719 --> 35:31.719
I am cushioned.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.720
But they have broken your hand,
To me the knee is torture.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.040
They have screwed up,
They screwed up but fine.

35:47.559 --> 35:48.559
Hi.

35:49.599 --> 35:51.519
I made a mistake.

35:52.719 --> 35:54.399
The truth is that...

35:55.840 --> 35:57.400
I...

35:57.800 --> 35:58.560
I behaved badly ...

35:58.599 --> 36:00.799
You are very brave, Andrew, a lot.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.079
I did something wrong.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.400
Yes.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.440
And he says a lot about you as a man
Tell us about it.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.119
We all do bad things,
But not everyone admits it.

36:10.159 --> 36:11.480
Thanks Jarvis.

36:11.519 --> 36:13.239
That is not enough, Dolan.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.240
Or tell us what happened
or I swear I'll take care of the girl ...

36:16.280 --> 36:19.800
I know I did wrong.
That is the difference.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.800
It was a serious mistake ...

36:24.840 --> 36:29.840
Andrew, our sources
they have launched very concrete accusations

36:29.880 --> 36:33.559
with regard
to what happened that night ...

36:34.039 --> 36:36.119
at the Europa Hotel.

36:36.159 --> 36:38.399
Do you remember the Europa Hotel party?

36:38.440 --> 36:40.280
When we entered,
everyone looked at us

36:40.320 --> 36:43.120
They wanted to talk to us,
shake hands

36:43.159 --> 36:45.559
Do you remember...

36:45.599 --> 36:49.880
of the feeling of high,
of being the center of attention?

36:53.639 --> 36:55.799
We have to talk about the girls.

36:57.199 --> 37:00.439
The two girls that you ...

37:01.000 --> 37:04.559
Did you have a drink with them?
Did you dance with them?

37:04.599 --> 37:06.279
They asked you ...

37:06.320 --> 37:08.519
an autograph? Or do you ...

37:08.559 --> 37:10.079
You remember?

37:10.119 --> 37:12.839
It was a long time ago,
But surely you remember.

37:15.639 --> 37:17.000
I remember.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.320
I remember that...

37:25.719 --> 37:27.159
one of the girls approached me,

37:28.239 --> 37:30.199
came out of the people,

37:30.239 --> 37:32.239
I wanted a picture.

37:33.639 --> 37:34.839
She was drunk,

37:35.480 --> 37:38.920
He started fooling around
With my hair and so on

37:39.559 --> 37:41.320
I wanted to try on my leather jacket.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.680
It happens to me many times.

37:48.119 --> 37:50.599
It was ... very sweet.

37:54.119 --> 37:57.679
He invited his friends
to join us, a couple.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.320
Young boys,

38:02.159 --> 38:04.920
About 17, 18 maybe.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.280
I...

38:09.960 --> 38:11.920
I invited them ...

38:12.159 --> 38:14.480
It was silly, I guess ...

38:17.360 --> 38:19.120
To my room.

38:19.679 --> 38:21.199
Y...

38:22.519 --> 38:23.880
the boyfriend...

38:25.039 --> 38:26.679
the couple...

38:27.599 --> 38:30.079
It was he who insisted.

38:31.039 --> 38:33.599
It was the girl who didn't want to come.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.480
We get high a little.

38:39.559 --> 38:41.119
Ecstasy and such.

38:42.639 --> 38:46.079
I stared at the couple.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.720
They were giving the lot,

38:48.960 --> 38:51.240
You know, fucking.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.440
Y...

38:54.679 --> 38:56.440
then I approached,

38:57.960 --> 38:59.559
I got into bed

38:59.960 --> 39:01.720
While they...

39:03.039 --> 39:06.119
and I put my hand on ...

39:08.599 --> 39:12.759
Then she ... got pissed off.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.239
Stopped me.

39:16.719 --> 39:20.439
I said: "I thought that for that
we had climbed here. "

39:20.800 --> 39:23.800
You know, to the room and all that.

39:25.039 --> 39:26.320
To have a good time.

39:28.880 --> 39:32.800
The boyfriend went crazy,
He started screaming at me.

39:32.840 --> 39:36.559
He kicked me out of bed.

39:38.639 --> 39:40.839
I punched him.

39:42.159 --> 39:44.719
I hit him very hard.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.000
And so...

39:50.280 --> 39:52.160
the girl started screaming ...

39:53.880 --> 39:57.840
He looked at me ... with a hateful face.

39:58.239 --> 40:00.959
I grabbed her throat ...

40:04.320 --> 40:05.760
Y...

40:07.159 --> 40:08.759
I raped her.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.640
I could not stop.

40:12.679 --> 40:14.359
I tried.

40:15.480 --> 40:19.639
She kept saying: "Please."

40:25.920 --> 40:27.840
He begged me to stop.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.960
But I could not.

40:34.639 --> 40:35.759
I did not do it.

40:48.039 --> 40:49.880
Has been very...

40:52.000 --> 40:54.159
Has been very...

40:56.280 --> 40:58.440
Brave.
You have been very brave.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.199
Andrew, and ...

41:02.599 --> 41:04.039
you've been...

41:05.360 --> 41:06.640
very...

41:07.920 --> 41:08.920
very sincere.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.280
Can I go now, please?

41:15.320 --> 41:17.039
And shit, it doesn't go away.

41:17.079 --> 41:19.759
Tell us what he did to you
To the boy and the other girl.

41:20.199 --> 41:21.799
Andrew,

41:22.480 --> 41:26.719
we have to focus now
in what happened to him

41:26.960 --> 41:28.880
To the boy.

41:28.920 --> 41:32.240
- I punched him in the face.
- Yes and what happened.

41:32.679 --> 41:34.639
Four or five times.

41:35.119 --> 41:36.559
He rose again.

41:39.119 --> 41:41.599
We started fighting.

41:42.039 --> 41:43.719
And then what happened?

41:44.719 --> 41:46.480
Well I...

41:46.519 --> 41:47.599
I hit him again.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.559
Once again.

41:52.159 --> 41:53.960
And later...

41:54.920 --> 41:58.800
I tied him to the radiator.

41:59.719 --> 42:02.039
I put a sock in his mouth.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.200
Did you put a sock in his mouth?

42:06.920 --> 42:08.360
Yes.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.320
I gagged him.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.639
He almost drowned.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.320
I thought I killed him.

42:24.199 --> 42:27.559
No I can not...

42:28.760 --> 42:31.040
Stop thinking about it.

42:31.599 --> 42:33.360
I don't get it out of my head.

42:34.239 --> 42:35.239
Do not!

42:47.880 --> 42:49.039
But what the fuck ...?

42:53.320 --> 42:54.120
Enough!

42:54.159 --> 42:56.119
Enough, fuck!

43:00.480 --> 43:02.480
OMG!

43:21.679 --> 43:23.319
Jarv, trunk!

43:23.360 --> 43:25.960
What are you doing down there?
Come on, get up.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.840
We have to prepare
The program, you and me.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.760
The countdown

43:34.960 --> 43:36.880
Come on, trunk!

43:38.159 --> 43:40.920
I'm going to lie here
a little while, because ...

43:41.280 --> 43:42.880
to be honest,

43:44.840 --> 43:47.720
I need to close my eyes for a minute.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.599
Andrew.

43:51.039 --> 43:52.119
Better.

43:52.159 --> 43:54.119
Give me two minutes.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.000
Andrew, don't go.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.199
I am here with you.

43:59.239 --> 44:01.559
Come on man.
We have to do the program.

44:11.039 --> 44:13.800
Lift up, Dolan.
This is not over yet.

44:26.599 --> 44:29.279
Control yourself, let's go inside
on antenna again.

44:34.079 --> 44:35.559
Get out of here, pussy.

45:53.199 --> 45:55.119
Come on out.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.800
Behind.

45:59.039 --> 46:00.239
Behind!

46:00.880 --> 46:02.840
- Back, let's go!
- Calm down.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.519
I am going to kill you.

46:07.039 --> 46:08.480
Throw the gun.

46:08.760 --> 46:11.320
You throw the fucking shotgun, come on.

46:27.480 --> 46:28.599
Fuck you, Jarvis!

46:29.199 --> 46:30.359
Fuck you!

46:32.079 --> 46:34.480
You are a fucking bastard!

46:38.079 --> 46:39.679
Take your mask off.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.440
Claire!

46:49.320 --> 46:50.720
Anthony!

46:51.199 --> 46:53.279
Can you hear me, Claire?

46:54.280 --> 46:55.280
Anthony!

47:04.760 --> 47:06.960
These scenes
They take place in the movie.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.200
Valentine's Day is presented
turbulent in Britain,

47:10.239 --> 47:11.856
with torrential rains
and strong winds

47:11.880 --> 47:13.960
due a mass
Arctic frozen air

47:14.000 --> 47:16.400
that will bring temperatures
of -6 degrees Celsius

47:16.440 --> 47:19.079
and snowfall 15 cm thick.

47:20.039 --> 47:22.400
You are more stupid than I imagined.

47:23.119 --> 47:24.279
Raise it up.

47:26.079 --> 47:27.079
Fuck!

47:39.760 --> 47:42.720
I introduce you to the guy
That is to blame for all this.

47:42.760 --> 47:45.040
Anthony, Jarvis.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.440
Jarvis,

47:47.880 --> 47:49.160
Anthony

47:51.480 --> 47:54.039
This was going to be easy, very easy.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.400
But you don't like to be told
What needs to be done, right?

47:58.440 --> 48:00.639
Well, like it or not,
You will go there again.

48:00.679 --> 48:04.679
And if you try to become the hero,
We will burst his head.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.840
Is it clear to you?

48:07.519 --> 48:08.719
Yes, very clear.

48:08.760 --> 48:13.000
- I will not repeat it to you.
- Yes, it is clear, very clear.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.800
Get him out of here.

48:26.119 --> 48:29.400
At the right time, in BOD Radio.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.039
Please.

48:33.079 --> 48:36.199
Do you know what you eat?
Charles River thinks not.

48:36.239 --> 48:37.319
I have not done anything.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.240
Learn all
about good nutrition ...

48:47.639 --> 48:50.319
Get ready, Dolan,
You will enter again.

48:52.639 --> 48:54.879
With Jarvis Dolan

48:56.440 --> 48:57.920
Today was a night of madness,

48:57.960 --> 49:01.240
let's open the lines to the lunatics
on the other side of the phone

49:01.280 --> 49:02.640
Do not be shy.

49:02.679 --> 49:04.279
We will receive calls.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.240
Be brave.

49:05.280 --> 49:08.320
Come on, come with me
in The Raw Reality.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.320
Hi.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.559
My name is Alex.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.760
I have been listening to the program.

49:15.480 --> 49:16.800
Hi Alex.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.440
Many people
saying this and that ...

49:19.960 --> 49:22.880
But they do nothing but lower
to those girls, don't you think?

49:23.320 --> 49:25.680
They do not even know
what are you talking about.

49:25.719 --> 49:26.719
Y...

49:27.519 --> 49:30.119
You know
What are you talking about, right, Alex?

49:30.159 --> 49:31.359
Yes.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.280
I was there, right?

49:34.360 --> 49:36.480
- You were there.
- Yes.

49:37.119 --> 49:39.880
And you too, Jarvis,
You were there too.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.480
- I was there, right?
- Yes.

49:42.880 --> 49:47.760
It's true that I was at Hotel Europa,
We have already said that.

49:47.800 --> 49:48.840
But...

49:50.800 --> 49:54.280
Alex, are you implying
that I covered up the rape?

49:54.320 --> 49:56.800
I don't imply anything,
I am presenting the facts.

49:56.840 --> 49:57.680
The facts.

49:57.719 --> 50:01.480
After raping my girlfriend,
Your friend's motherfucker called you

50:01.519 --> 50:03.719
crying and sobbing like a baby.

50:03.760 --> 50:07.920
Lucy was fatal,
I couldn't even move.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.400
How will we know
if you have even been to Belfast?

50:10.440 --> 50:14.039
He called you to go up
to the room and you did it.

50:14.079 --> 50:17.119
I thought it was all over,
but it wasn't like that, right?

50:19.920 --> 50:22.000
So that's what it's about, right?

50:22.960 --> 50:25.480
Is this the modus operandi?

50:25.519 --> 50:27.960
Are we going to believe anyone who calls

50:28.000 --> 50:31.039
and tell us the first
that crosses his mind?

50:36.920 --> 50:39.760
It is not the first
That crosses my mind.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.560
And I am not anyone.

50:41.599 --> 50:46.039
You know very well who I am,
because you were there

50:46.440 --> 50:49.760
You were
the bastards that did this to me.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.440
You broke a bottle in my face,
You left me without teeth.

50:52.480 --> 50:55.159
And that bastard, that motherfucker
that is there on the ground,

50:55.199 --> 50:58.079
I did that, I did that.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.519
Nothing to say, clown?

51:02.360 --> 51:05.599
And now what, cocoon,
are you going to have the eggs to deny it?

51:11.880 --> 51:13.800
- Piece of shit!
- Enough!

51:13.840 --> 51:16.400
- You're going to talk, you bastard!
- That's how we get nothing!

51:25.239 --> 51:27.000
He will not speak.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.400
He knows what he says
It will look bad.

51:30.639 --> 51:33.159
You, don't move from there.

51:33.480 --> 51:36.039
And you, come back here.

51:36.079 --> 51:38.519
Shit!

51:38.559 --> 51:40.480
We will give you a little
of your own medicine.

51:40.519 --> 51:42.800
Sometimes I wonder

51:42.840 --> 51:45.960
if it would not be better to cut
All feedback with the audience.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.159
You know.

51:47.199 --> 51:49.119
The tyranny is over
of social networks,

51:49.159 --> 51:52.639
the asshole of the open lines,
I hate them mails.

51:52.679 --> 51:54.239
What do you think, Anthony?

51:54.760 --> 51:58.560
What do i think What should I face
The consequences, Mr. Dolan.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.400
What do you do with those two pirates?

52:02.480 --> 52:04.199
Shut up now, fuck.

52:06.360 --> 52:09.720
You look like a guy
quite sensible.

52:11.440 --> 52:14.720
Sure you know this
it does not make any sense.

52:15.599 --> 52:17.599
I deal with people like that continuously.

52:20.119 --> 52:21.639
They are insane.

52:25.440 --> 52:29.000
Claire went to the police after
That you raped her, did you know?

52:29.039 --> 52:30.279
Oh yeah?

52:31.400 --> 52:34.519
Well, I don't think they believed her because ...

52:35.119 --> 52:36.480
They never talked to me.

52:37.800 --> 52:40.840
Is used
For people like you to ignore it.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.039
- People like me?
- Yes.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.400
Those who handle the cotarro.

52:46.599 --> 52:50.400
There is only one person here
driving the cotarro, and it's not me.

52:50.639 --> 52:52.839
And of course neither do you.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.039
Why are you here?

53:06.760 --> 53:07.840
Why are you going to ...

53:09.679 --> 53:11.599
ruin your life?

53:15.719 --> 53:16.919
Lucy

53:19.800 --> 53:20.800
What?

53:24.440 --> 53:28.240
Lucy, the girl you raped, you bastards.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.280
Do not.

53:30.239 --> 53:32.959
I have not raped anyone in my life.

53:37.239 --> 53:40.199
And seeing that mischievous friend of yours,

53:40.239 --> 53:43.239
- I imagine your girlfriend will be the same ...
- She's my daughter.

53:50.239 --> 53:52.159
I do not know what to say.

53:57.559 --> 53:59.759
Look, I also have a daughter.

54:05.559 --> 54:08.119
I can't ... I can't win, right?

54:09.840 --> 54:10.840
What?

54:11.840 --> 54:13.960
You are going to kill me

54:14.000 --> 54:17.079
for some binge stories
On a night he left as a mother.

54:17.119 --> 54:20.119
They're just ... little boys.

54:24.679 --> 54:26.519
What can I do?

54:27.599 --> 54:30.319
You can start by telling me the truth.

54:32.159 --> 54:34.119
What did you do to my daughter?

54:35.159 --> 54:37.359
Where is my daughter, you bastard?

54:39.360 --> 54:41.200
I want to talk to him.

54:42.199 --> 54:43.960
I want to talk to him.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.039
Already!

54:48.360 --> 54:50.120
Put on the helmets.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.079
Raise it up.

55:03.119 --> 55:04.119
Jarvis

55:04.320 --> 55:07.480
How many deaths do you want to have
about consciousness

55:07.519 --> 55:10.639
before starting
to collaborate a little more?

55:10.880 --> 55:13.160
Claire, tell me what you want.

55:13.199 --> 55:15.759
tell me what you want
and let's finish at once.

55:16.440 --> 55:18.280
Why such a hurry?

55:18.320 --> 55:20.760
Now that we were
beginning to know us ...

55:20.800 --> 55:21.880
Tell me what you want.

55:24.079 --> 55:26.440
We will enter antenna.

55:26.480 --> 55:29.679
I want you to count
to everyone what you did to me

55:29.719 --> 55:31.959
and what you did to Lucy.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.840
You will show yourself how you are

55:33.880 --> 55:35.559
and you are going to tell everyone

55:35.599 --> 55:39.360
the cowardly motherfucker class
That you are and always have been.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
Do not.

55:49.119 --> 55:52.079
Do it. He is serious

55:53.400 --> 55:54.400
How did you say

55:57.559 --> 56:00.519
I have said no.

56:03.320 --> 56:04.600
Jarvis!

56:05.800 --> 56:06.840
Jarvis!

56:08.119 --> 56:10.839
Whatever happens,
I'm not going to get out of this alive.

56:11.760 --> 56:15.600
And you will go to jail
For the death of two people.

56:15.639 --> 56:18.759
You will never know what happened to your daughter.

56:28.400 --> 56:31.280
Jarvis! I speak very seriously.

56:31.320 --> 56:34.000
How do I do to...?
Claire, Claire.

56:34.960 --> 56:36.960
What the hell are you doing?
This is not what we talked about.

56:37.719 --> 56:40.599
You told me we weren't going to ...

56:40.639 --> 56:41.639
Claire!

56:43.320 --> 56:44.440
Claire!

56:54.599 --> 56:56.159
Anthony has nothing to do with this.

56:56.199 --> 56:57.119
No, no, please.

56:57.159 --> 56:59.079
The wrong person
In the wrong place.

56:59.119 --> 57:01.079
I can not do anything.

57:01.119 --> 57:02.519
Please, it will kill me.

57:03.039 --> 57:05.039
Get back to your site, Jarvis!

57:05.079 --> 57:06.639
Claire, what the hell are you doing?

57:06.679 --> 57:08.440
Jarvis, do you think it's a joke?

57:08.480 --> 57:10.440
- Please.
- Everything will be fine.

57:10.480 --> 57:11.960
Check out Andrew!

57:12.000 --> 57:13.199
He won't let me kill you.

57:13.239 --> 57:15.119
- Look good!
- No Please.

57:15.159 --> 57:18.879
Claire, this is crazy.
They are going to fuck us but good.

57:19.119 --> 57:20.400
Nothing will happen to you.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.480
Anthony, nothing will happen to you.

57:22.519 --> 57:24.480
Anthony, nothing will happen to you.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.360
Fuck, stop it!

57:26.400 --> 57:27.639
- It will be your fault.
- Claire.

57:27.679 --> 57:29.879
Nothing will happen,
It won't kill you. Look at me.

57:29.920 --> 57:32.000
Anthony, nothing will happen to you.

57:32.039 --> 57:34.960
Please.
They will kill me, fuck.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.440
Anthony, nothing will happen to you.
Look at me.

57:37.480 --> 57:40.519
You will not die.
Anthony, he won't let that ...

57:40.559 --> 57:41.759
- Claire ...
- Do it!

57:42.039 --> 57:42.960
Anthony!

57:43.000 --> 57:44.480
No no no!

58:09.239 --> 58:11.319
Quiet,
We have to continue with the plan.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.440
Hey, what are you doing? Go get him.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.480
Oh shit!

59:19.199 --> 59:20.199
Fuck!

59:48.480 --> 59:49.719
Listen to me!

59:51.039 --> 59:52.039
Listen out!

59:52.079 --> 59:53.759
The trapdoor behind you!

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Fuck!

01:00:59.039 --> 01:00:59.960
Shoot!

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.360
Don't escape, come on!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.039
It's me, fucking morons!

01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:10.320
Cool!

01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:30.559
Son of...!

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:31.599
Fuck you!

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.320
Fuck!

01:01:58.079 --> 01:01:59.559
Emergencies, what do you need?

01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:02.239
They want to kill me,
They have already killed two people.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.080
Lord, calm down. Listen?

01:02:04.119 --> 01:02:06.279
Is the aggressor there with you?

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.440
Do you know where it is?

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.280
Look we can't help you
If you don't tell us where it is.

01:02:17.519 --> 01:02:20.800
Let's locate
Call, do not hang up.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.599
Let me help you.

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:05.759
Close the door.

01:03:11.719 --> 01:03:13.799
What happened to you?

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.920
I'm fine.

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:17.679
I'm fine.

01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:19.039
I'm fine.

01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:21.799
Samuel brought me here.
I do not know what is happening.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.200
I just want to go home.

01:03:23.239 --> 01:03:25.039
Sam left me here.
I want to go home.

01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:26.175
- I know.
- I want to go home.

01:03:26.199 --> 01:03:27.480
I know.

01:03:27.719 --> 01:03:29.279
I'll take you home.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.360
Soon we will go.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.240
Voucher? We are going home.

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:40.239
I'm really scared!

01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:43.639
Take it

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.639
Do not!

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.280
- Do not!
- Enough!

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.680
Has it not been clear to you yet?

01:03:55.519 --> 01:03:57.440
- Do not!
- Shut!

01:04:02.679 --> 01:04:04.399
Look at me. You just look at me.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960
Look at me.

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:08.719
Father.

01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:11.359
Take your dirty hands away
of my daughter, cocoon.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.720
BOD Radio on 99.9 of the FM.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320
The best debates,
from London to the world.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.800
At the right time, in BOD Radio.

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:24.440
- Let it go.
- Neither of pussy.

01:04:25.679 --> 01:04:27.480
Unstoppable, idealistic ...

01:04:27.519 --> 01:04:28.519
You are happy?

01:04:29.079 --> 01:04:31.480
Your daughter is missing,
And my daughter should pay for it?

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:35.199
Discover The Raw Reality,
with Jarvis Dolan.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:38.239
From one father to another father,
I beg you, let Julia leave.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920
What if...

01:04:40.199 --> 01:04:41.359
Release it

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.440
We could call it justice,
But it's nothing but hate.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.320
I feel comfortable
with that responsibility ...

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.880
Tell him apart
His dirty hands of my daughter!

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.159
I don't want any more laws,

01:04:51.199 --> 01:04:54.000
i don't want the government
Tell me how I should behave.

01:04:54.039 --> 01:04:56.320
Promise me that nothing will happen.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.760
I don't have to promise you anything.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.000
If you want to continue with this
you must make sure

01:05:00.039 --> 01:05:01.759
Nothing will happen to him.

01:05:04.119 --> 01:05:06.199
- Let's start.
- We weren't going to kidnap ...

01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:08.039
It is not time,
And I don't like repeating myself.

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:11.079
Well, he won't die here
No one else, is that clear?

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:13.519
You don't want to know what happened to Lucy?

01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:18.400
That clown over there is the only one
That can tell you.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.360
Most of the time, they are ideas
wrong and most are lies.

01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:26.800
They do not reflect reality,
the crude reality.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.360
The bad of lies
is that if you don't stop repeating them,

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.119
People end up believing them.

01:05:32.159 --> 01:05:34.000
I have nothing to do with it.

01:05:34.039 --> 01:05:36.880
It really hurts, it's horrible,

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.400
uncomfortable

01:05:40.679 --> 01:05:42.039
DISAPPEARED - LUCILLE BRENNAN

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:43.639
What is promised is debt,

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:46.599
We go with the next call.
Do not be shy.

01:05:46.639 --> 01:05:48.719
You are in The Raw Reality.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.519
PHONE

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.400
My name is Claire Spencer.

01:05:58.719 --> 01:06:01.199
I didn't know if I should call.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.840
It is painful
Think about that night.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.000
Very painful.

01:06:11.719 --> 01:06:14.399
The boy who has called before
is my friend.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.800
An old friend.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.640
We knew that our parents did not
they would let us go to Belfast alone so ...

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.400
We invented
A school trip.

01:06:28.559 --> 01:06:32.400
We didn't have a hard
not even a place to stay,

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.599
the idea was to be
partying all night

01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:38.000
and then return directly to London.

01:06:39.679 --> 01:06:42.799
It seemed like a very funny plan
When you are 16 years old.

01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:50.679
What Andrew has said is true.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.240
I fooled with him.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.400
And that?

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.519
Then...

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.440
We went up to Andrew's room.

01:07:17.719 --> 01:07:20.839
When I woke up,
That seemed like a nightmare.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.079
I was face down,

01:07:26.119 --> 01:07:29.559
Andrew was on top of me,

01:07:29.599 --> 01:07:33.279
it reeked of vomit
and it was hurting me a lot.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.680
Jarvis was there,

01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:40.599
Jarvis Dolan had
Lucy caught by the neck.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.200
Lucy was so bad
I could barely breathe.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.440
I've blamed myself so many times.

01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:53.399
I felt...

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.760
disgusted

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.519
And ashamed.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.079
I went completely crazy.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360
Claire

01:08:12.159 --> 01:08:15.159
I understand that it must have been something ...

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.920
It must have been something traumatic but ...

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.640
What does that have to do with me?

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.960
You were there.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:24.238
No, nothing of that.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.118
It was not so,
Andrew has already admitted what he did.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.960
You already have what you want.
Why do you have to get me into this?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.279
He called you after raping Lucy!

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.920
Yes, yes, he called me,

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.560
but he never mentioned anything
About you or about Lucy.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.640
I went up to the room, took him out of there
and I took him to our hotel, the Merchant.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.000
Why don't you call Hotel Europa?

01:08:47.038 --> 01:08:49.880
You will see that not even
We had a room there.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920
Lie!

01:08:51.118 --> 01:08:53.960
I woke up in that room!

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.479
I was shattered.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.800
I had to help Alex,
but Lucy was gone.

01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:01.118
In what room?

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.839
We had no room there.
The only ones...

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.960
The only ones ...?

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.560
The only ones who had room there

01:09:12.198 --> 01:09:14.158
They were the technicians.

01:09:14.198 --> 01:09:16.279
It would be Anthony's room ...

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.679
You are a miserable fucking.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.399
I still can't believe what you did to us.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.639
If you were so badly hurt
and you went to the police,

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.960
Why didn't they stop me?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.760
I did it!

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.640
- Do you want to see the forensic report?
- I would love to.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.479
What you say makes no sense.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.760
Clear.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.720
The word of a drunk
against yours.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.158
The police looked at me
As if he had looked for me.

01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:48.359
You don't understand, right?

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.279
I may be screwed,
But at least I'm here to tell.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.280
What did you do to Lucy?

01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:58.479
I did nothing!

01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.480
What did you do to him?

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.160
What did you do to my little one, you bastard?

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:04.599
What did you do to him?
Just tell me the truth, please.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.440
I swear!

01:10:05.479 --> 01:10:06.919
Tell me the truth, host!

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.039
Please please,
just tell me the truth.

01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:12.319
I beg you, I just want the truth.

01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:19.000
Let's see what he tells us
The next call.

01:10:19.039 --> 01:10:19.920
Do not be shy.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.496
What sounds is the antenna broadcast.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.080
We have to make sure.

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:28.479
My name is Claire Spencer.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.560
You're good?

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.760
I need to think.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.039
- Quiet, everything will be fine.
- Let's see...

01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:39.279
We are riding a good one.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:42.119
If they cut the broadcast,
All this will not have helped.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.080
The guy you called before ...

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:46.119
Make sure you don't take off your helmets.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.920
An old friend.

01:10:48.359 --> 01:10:49.719
We knew that our parents

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.640
they wouldn't leave us
ir a Belfast solos...

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.680
We came up with the idea ...

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.400
You can see it yourself.

01:11:05.119 --> 01:11:06.319
What else do you need?

01:11:07.359 --> 01:11:09.279
He has invented everything.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.079
She's crazy.

01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:18.399
Â¿Claire?

01:11:21.119 --> 01:11:24.000
TRENDS

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.680
What?

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.880
Have you never been 17 years old?

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.600
I know uncles like you.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.119
You like to have the girls
at your service

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:38.599
That they fear you
and keep quiet.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.560
You screwed me that night but fine.

01:11:44.319 --> 01:11:46.359
But the worst was yet to come.

01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:49.639
Do you have any idea what it is
live dead of fear?

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.880
I'm going to show you.

01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:05.399
Do not! Fuck!

01:12:05.439 --> 01:12:07.879
No no no!
Do not touch her!

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.840
Are you going to tell her too
that nothing will happen?

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.640
You are on antenna.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.319
I have no other choice,

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.400
I have to give Claire Spencer
the answer that ...

01:12:30.319 --> 01:12:32.239
He deserves.

01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:35.880
Present the facts.

01:12:39.159 --> 01:12:43.720
You see, Andrew called me because
He realized what he had bundled up.

01:12:44.079 --> 01:12:46.479
I was scared
and when I got there,

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.800
He told me that you had been ...

01:12:50.039 --> 01:12:52.159
fooling around, everyone ...

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:56.880
You had taken several drugs.

01:12:58.239 --> 01:13:00.519
And that the girl
with whom he had slept,

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.360
the girl that you uploaded
to that room,

01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:07.599
I had an overdose.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.280
You are a liar, Jarvis.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.800
You were there.
What does it cost you to admit it?

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.440
Andrew was ...
with all the clichÃ©s,

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:24.559
he was the typical famous that is believed
that is above others,

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.039
but if you let me,

01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:31.720
you let yourself be seduced by the clichÃ©.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.640
Claire, you swallowed it,
you fell into his hook like a fool.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.720
And as usually happens
in that kind of nights,

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:46.720
with the grupis, the famous ...

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.840
The thing got out of hand ...

01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:53.159
and Andrew panicked.

01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:55.559
He screwed up ...

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.720
and then he called me.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.560
What did you do to my daughter?

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.319
I did nothing.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.600
I didn't put a hand on it,
I just tried to help.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.079
I took Lucy, took her to the hospital.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.600
I left her at the Emergency entrance,
When I left, she was fine.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.840
"All right".

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.440
You will be a son of a bitch!

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880
Kill him.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.680
Kill him, just recognized
That was there.

01:14:28.039 --> 01:14:30.359
I left her where they could find her,

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.159
Where I could get help.

01:14:32.199 --> 01:14:35.199
No. I would have returned
With his mother and with me.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.720
Please.

01:14:40.199 --> 01:14:42.439
Please. Tell him to release her.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.039
Please.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.880
I beg you, tell him to release Julia.
It's just a girl.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920
Just a girl?

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.000
Like us, you bastard?

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.039
Kill him or I will!

01:14:53.079 --> 01:14:56.199
You do not know what it is
not knowing what the hell happened

01:14:56.239 --> 01:14:59.840
the things that go through your mind,
You do not know what it is.

01:15:01.159 --> 01:15:02.439
What did you do to him?

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.159
I have told you the truth.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.440
Kill her!

01:15:05.479 --> 01:15:06.559
Andrew was ...

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.039
- Do not!
- Let's go!

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.199
Do not!

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.680
Enough.

01:15:13.399 --> 01:15:14.879
Lower the shotgun.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.239
- Tell him to stop.
- Kill her.

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.840
We are not going to kill a girl
Because of this bastard.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.400
Tell him to release her.

01:15:21.319 --> 01:15:23.000
Fuck

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.079
- Kill her!
- Do not!

01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:26.239
No Please!

01:15:26.279 --> 01:15:27.639
Tell him to stop right now.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.640
Claire, tell her to let her go, host!

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.039
Kill her!

01:15:31.079 --> 01:15:32.600
Kill her at once!

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.720
Let your father know what it is to suffer!

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:38.199
Claire, tell her to let her go!

01:15:38.239 --> 01:15:40.800
I killed her!
I killed her!

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.079
Quiet, host!

01:15:49.119 --> 01:15:50.159
I just tried to help.

01:15:55.239 --> 01:15:56.479
What have you said?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.560
I killed her with my own hands.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.480
Piece of bastard.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.000
When I entered there ...

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.960
What the hell is he saying?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.199
I took her to the hospital.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.159
I left her at the Emergency entrance,
When I left, she was fine.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.720
Everyone was unconscious.

01:16:29.439 --> 01:16:33.839
I pulled Andrew from there
and went back in to clean.

01:16:34.319 --> 01:16:35.279
Y...

01:16:35.319 --> 01:16:37.759
- OMG!
- I thought she was dead.

01:16:39.399 --> 01:16:41.719
Suddenly he woke up and saw me.

01:16:45.399 --> 01:16:47.759
Then I knew ...

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.360
That was our end.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.320
I knew I could destroy everything.

01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:56.599
What kind
of a monster son of a bitch are you?

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.720
My little.

01:17:01.279 --> 01:17:02.279
Why?

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.640
When we have nothing to lose,

01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:10.000
We become monsters.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640
Kill him.

01:17:14.079 --> 01:17:17.479
He just admitted that he killed her.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.280
You will get away with it,
as he always does

01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:21.920
Kill him!

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.600
What do you think will happen to us?

01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:30.000
- Do not.
- Do not?

01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:32.799
No one else is going to die.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:38.000
And much less that girl.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.320
He has already confessed.

01:17:41.479 --> 01:17:43.000
This will come out in what ...

01:17:44.119 --> 01:17:45.960
About three minutes?

01:17:50.039 --> 01:17:51.960
I will call the police.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.960
Do not!

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.600
- Let go!
- Do not!

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640
Let go!

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:13.599
Let her go, pussy!

01:18:15.479 --> 01:18:17.559
Would have returned
With his mother and with me.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.600
Please. Tell him to release her.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.360
Do not! Do not!

01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:23.879
Release her, host!

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.760
Kill him, come on!

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.279
- Kill him!
- Lower the weapon. Lower it.

01:18:30.319 --> 01:18:31.679
Drop your weapon.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.360
- Let her go, pussy.
- Claire, shut up!

01:18:34.399 --> 01:18:37.079
I just want to know where it is.
Tell me where it is.

01:18:37.119 --> 01:18:39.760
Drop the gun at once!

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.320
I just ... Listen, I beg you,
Just tell me where it is

01:18:43.359 --> 01:18:44.719
If you throw the gun, I'll tell you.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.560
I promise you, I will tell you.

01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:50.559
Drop the shotgun and I'll tell you!

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.559
Lower it.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.200
What do you do?
What are you going to do?

01:19:04.279 --> 01:19:05.880
It's in the fucking river.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.079
I am going to kill you.

01:19:19.279 --> 01:19:21.159
Kill her! Kill her!

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.239
- Fuck you!
- Do it!

01:19:23.279 --> 01:19:26.159
CabrÃ³n, you threw it into the river
as if it was garbage!

01:19:26.399 --> 01:19:28.199
I'm going to kill you, you bastard.

01:19:29.119 --> 01:19:30.840
What do you intend to do, Dolan?

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.520
What are you thinking to do?
You only have one shot left.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.600
What the hell are you going to do?

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.000
Julia!

01:19:40.479 --> 01:19:41.639
Julia, look at dad!

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:51.319
Fuck you!

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.600
Stop it, please!
You have to stop it!

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.320
Stop him, he will kill her.
He is going to ...

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.520
Come on, get up.

01:23:25.399 --> 01:23:27.479
OMG! Do not!

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.240
Relax nothing happens.
Do not look.

01:23:31.079 --> 01:23:33.039
Close your eyes.

01:23:33.079 --> 01:23:34.439
Close your eyes.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.720
Ok, don't look.

01:23:38.199 --> 01:23:41.199
I know, I know, close your eyes.

01:23:42.039 --> 01:23:43.920
We're going home, okay?

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.120
- Oh God!
- Quiet.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.119
It's over.

01:23:56.439 --> 01:23:57.439
It's over.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.079
Â¿Jules?

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.440
Â¿Jules?

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.240
- I'm sorry, I can not...
- Jules!

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.680
Shit!

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.480
I don't know, Jarvis.

01:25:09.159 --> 01:25:12.599
Fuck how could he leave
both of the hands?

01:25:13.039 --> 01:25:15.159
What do you want me to tell you, Norman?

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.400
I already know.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.560
But Anthony ...

01:25:24.039 --> 01:25:25.960
It's a tragedy.

01:25:29.279 --> 01:25:30.559
How...?

01:25:31.279 --> 01:25:32.639
How is Julia?

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.480
Not well.

01:25:38.359 --> 01:25:39.639
Not well?

01:25:45.399 --> 01:25:47.439
Can we get to the point?

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.560
The crude reality,
They want me back.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.240
Not only for the radio,

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.400
Also television, broadcasting, everything.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:04.720
They have not set limits
regarding money

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.720
and have accepted all your proposals.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.880
All?

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.920
The slots,
the team, the interviews ...

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.319
You may get Trump.

01:26:22.119 --> 01:26:23.720
The rest...

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:27.159
It has been in every yellow press
all those girls counting ...

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.920
that Andrew
it was never clean wheat ...

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.039
Anyway, who was going to imagine?

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.880
Is there anything else I should know?

01:26:40.079 --> 01:26:41.840
Should I be worry?

01:26:48.039 --> 01:26:50.279
You have nothing to worry about.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.279
I guarantee you.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.760
So then...

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.720
You'll want to go back to work.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.880
Yes.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.159
Thank you.

01:27:13.079 --> 01:27:14.680
Thank you.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.600
Ok, ok.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.960
Ok, ok!

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.439
Get to work at once.

01:27:33.279 --> 01:27:34.279
Julia

01:27:35.199 --> 01:27:37.239
What a surprise.
