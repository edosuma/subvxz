It's got this-this cool EDM vibe

but also, like,
a little bit of hip-hop,

00:14.331 --> 00:15.422
maybe a hint of dubstep?

00:15.574 --> 00:17.016
One of those

00:17.243 --> 00:18.425
That was dope.

<i> It's good.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:34.516
Oh, that's it? Okay.

-yet to-the-point...
-KAT: Oh.

00:46.438 --> 00:47.621
Oh.

00:47.773 --> 00:51.533
Hey. CJ sent photos
from his fancy ski vacation.

00:51.552 --> 00:55.128
Oh, wow! Look at him
going down that hill like a pro.

00:55.281 --> 00:58.557
Uh, no. Uh, he's in the pile
of snow next to that kid.

00:58.708 --> 01:00.467
Upside-down in the snow?

01:00.619 --> 01:01.635
Been there.

01:01.787 --> 01:04.379
Who's that good-looking man
next to CJ?

01:04.398 --> 01:07.900
Oh. Yeah, that's
my ex-wife's boyfriend, Xavier.

01:08.127 --> 01:09.050
I mean, what a dumb name.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.069
I mean, is he an X-Man?

01:10.220 --> 01:11.386
And his superpower is, what,

01:11.480 --> 01:13.614
throwing money around
to buy my kid's love?

01:14.650 --> 01:15.816
Xavier is paying
for the whole trip.

01:15.968 --> 01:17.225
It's kind of a touchy subject.

01:17.394 --> 01:19.152
Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah.
I'm cool with it.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.639
'Cause I'm gonna have the
biggest, baddest present for CJ

01:22.732 --> 01:23.657

01:23.733 --> 01:24.975

01:28.664 --> 01:31.072
I need to learn more words.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.165
Those are cool sneakers.

01:32.318 --> 01:34.075
-Yeah. Sneakers.
-Hey,

01:34.169 --> 01:36.261
they drop tomorrow at midnight,
so I got to get in line early.

01:36.488 --> 01:37.988
I need a line buddy.
I asked Randi,

01:38.006 --> 01:40.157
but she gave me
a definitive "hell no."

01:40.175 --> 01:41.992
Max, what about you?

01:42.085 --> 01:43.435
No way, man.
Tomorrow's my night off.

01:43.662 --> 01:44.845
Darren's covering the bar.

01:44.997 --> 01:47.422
Darren? Did you hire
Cousin Darren again?

01:47.516 --> 01:50.275
Wait, didn't you fire him for
almost burning this place down?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.852
Grandma said
I had to hire him back.

01:52.004 --> 01:54.279
And Grandma's kicking leg
is still strong.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.022
Phil, I bet
you'd be a good line buddy.

01:56.117 --> 01:59.100
Mm, no can do.
I got to bake erotic cookies

01:59.194 --> 02:00.452

02:00.604 --> 02:03.104

02:07.686 --> 02:08.852
You didn't ask me.

02:08.945 --> 02:10.295
I didn't think
it was your scene.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.522
I mean, if we were doing
a math-only trivia night,

02:12.616 --> 02:14.358
then you'd be the first person
I'd call.

02:14.376 --> 02:16.860
I know you're just joking,
but can we do that?

02:17.029 --> 02:18.470

03:14.844 --> 03:15.843
Oh, okay.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.604
You know,
when I was in fourth grade

03:17.756 --> 03:19.272
and we had to wait in line,
my teacher would say,

03:19.425 --> 03:22.201
"Turn to the person behind you
and learn something about them."

03:22.428 --> 03:23.702

I know you pretty well, Kat.

I know, at some point tonight,
you'll break out the cat videos.

03:30.619 --> 03:32.044
Oh, that's 'cause
there's nothing's cuter

03:32.271 --> 03:34.195
than a cat meowing "I love you."

03:34.215 --> 03:35.547
-(chuckles)
-Uh, oh,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.532
here's something you may not
know about me: one summer,

03:37.626 --> 03:39.443
I worked in the jewelry section
of that department store.

03:39.461 --> 03:42.446
Oh. Well, last summer,
I was followed by security

03:42.464 --> 03:45.465
in that very same
department store.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.802
-Okay, so there's that.
-Mm-hmm.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.637
You know I like to sing,
but did you know

03:50.789 --> 03:52.639
that my high school choir
placed first in the county?

03:52.791 --> 03:54.382
Oh. Hey, I was in choir, too.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.126
I loved it, but I was terrible.

03:56.219 --> 03:58.052
Sister Mary Ellen
would always say that my voice

03:58.072 --> 04:00.130
was sent by Lucifer to test her.

04:00.966 --> 04:02.557
I thought
nuns were supposed to be nice,

04:02.651 --> 04:04.058
although I'm basing that
solely on<i> Sister Act</i>

04:04.227 --> 04:06.561
-and<i> Sister Act 2:</i>
<i> Back in the Habit.</i>

04:53.460 --> 04:54.275
I took a sip.

I was home obsessing over
my breakup with Preston again.

05:06.381 --> 05:10.033
I-I was hoping Kat could
provide a fun distraction:

05:10.052 --> 05:11.292
a puzzle, or a game,

05:11.419 --> 05:14.220
or just watching her bump
into something.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.376
But Kat's out with Carter,

05:19.394 --> 05:22.212
so I was gonna
kind of have a night to myself.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.214
A bubble bath, a trashy book,

05:24.383 --> 05:26.216
and maybe take a lap
around the living room naked,

05:26.234 --> 05:28.643
'cause, you know, I'd be alone.

05:28.737 --> 05:33.390

-Oh, sorry, I didn't know

05:57.024 --> 05:58.431

05:58.584 --> 06:00.934
the one with the seat
perfectly molded to my butt--

06:01.086 --> 06:02.343
to his loser son-in-law.

06:02.437 --> 06:04.588

smelly truck.

06:04.606 --> 06:06.490

06:07.183 --> 06:08.992

06:12.539 --> 06:14.781
Ooh, now that you say it,
I am getting

06:14.933 --> 06:17.358
a whiff of curdled milk
and wet dog.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.128
I'm getting...
(sniffs) pine.

06:21.607 --> 06:23.698

is making me cover

06:23.717 --> 06:26.610

on Sunday. That's my day off!

06:26.703 --> 06:28.294

because love is love no matter
what language your cat speaks.

08:27.657 --> 08:29.674
You're kind of out there,
aren't you?

08:29.901 --> 08:31.492
-A little bit.
-(cat meows)

08:31.661 --> 08:32.919
Wait, did you hear that?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.162
-(cat meowing)
-Oh, yes.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.681
Look, there's a kitty.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.424
Oh, and it's in the street,
that's very dangerous.

08:38.577 --> 08:40.018
I have a cat carrier in
my truck. Do you mind if I...

08:40.229 --> 08:42.395
-Yeah, yeah, you gotta.
-Okay, I'll be right back.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.482
(tires screech)

08:46.860 --> 08:48.193
KAT:
I'm okay!

08:53.700 --> 08:56.760
♪<i> I was just a moment behind</i> ♪

08:56.778 --> 08:59.579
♪<i> Just a moment behind.</i> ♪

09:01.600 --> 09:03.190
It's good.

09:03.285 --> 09:05.192
Okay, it's pretty clear,
you hate it.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.861
I don't hate it.

09:06.938 --> 09:11.291
It's fine. I actually think it's
good to be a little polarizing.

09:11.459 --> 09:12.776
You know,
like brussels sprouts--

09:12.778 --> 09:14.553
some people love them,
some people hate them.

09:14.704 --> 09:17.447
All that matters is they're part
of the national conversation.

09:17.465 --> 09:20.708
Well, if it helps,
I love brussels sprouts.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.186
You know what? I'm gonna go.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.548
I have a penis emergency.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.641
Oh, uh...

09:28.735 --> 09:30.384
He means his cookies.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.961
And by "his cookies," he means?

09:32.055 --> 09:33.697
Actual cookies.

09:35.483 --> 09:37.984
Hey. This little guy
is so sweet,

09:38.136 --> 09:40.561
came right to me; no collar.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.488
It's so frustrating--
if they can say, "I love you,"

09:42.583 --> 09:45.750
why can't they say,
"I live at 400 Crenshaw Avenue"?

09:45.977 --> 09:47.252
No cuts.

09:47.403 --> 09:48.645
(laughs)

09:48.814 --> 09:50.255
Dude, I said no cuts.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.482
Are you serious?
You know I was here.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
Hey, I don't know how many pairs
they've got in there.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.595
I'm not letting some rando
cat lady ahead of me.

09:56.746 --> 10:01.099
Rando? We sang together!
We bonded over Señor Don Gato!

10:01.268 --> 10:02.342
Back of the line, ma'am.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.918
Daisy, you gotta
help me out here.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.937
Sorry.
<i> Je ne parle pas anglais.</i>

10:06.756 --> 10:09.107
Hey, it's-it's really important
that my friend get his shoes.

10:09.334 --> 10:10.834
-No cuts!
-No cuts.

10:10.852 --> 10:12.277
-Back of the line.
-No cuts.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.687
-Get in back of the line.
-No cuts.
-(others clamoring)

10:14.840 --> 10:18.191
I'm disappointed in you!
I'm disappointed in you, Daisy.

10:18.343 --> 10:20.267
I'm disappointed
in all of y'all.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.621
Not you, you're great.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.940
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.851
They look more like umbrellas.

10:27.869 --> 10:30.128
Yeah, your scale
is definitely off.

10:30.279 --> 10:32.613
And I've never seen one
that hooks like that.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.965
You need more detail.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.783
I have no idea what
I'm putting in my mouth.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.528
Well, for me, it always helps
to have a reference.

10:38.621 --> 10:40.472
You know,
something to work off of.

10:40.623 --> 10:42.557
Oh, that could help.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.053
No. That's what
the Internet's for, my friend.

10:47.205 --> 10:50.815
I know, but then you start
getting all that spam

10:50.967 --> 10:54.736
from ginger bears who
are horny to hook up.

10:56.231 --> 10:57.563
I'll take another crack at it.

10:57.732 --> 11:00.307
Speaking of cracks,
I forgot to do the butts.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.995
Okay, well,
mama is going back to her tub.

11:04.147 --> 11:05.388
Good night!

11:05.481 --> 11:07.815
Just need a little
clarification on the song.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.585
RANDI:
Oh, help me, sweet Black Jesus!

11:12.731 --> 11:15.581
Um, Kat, what the hell?

11:15.676 --> 11:18.659
Oh, um, okay, well,
I've got good news and bad news.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.586
Good news: I rescued a cat.
And the bad news is,

11:20.739 --> 11:22.997
well, I think you get that.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.074
I'm so sorry.
Second baritone Damon

11:25.243 --> 11:26.500
told me he'd hold my place.

11:26.594 --> 11:29.412
Of course he didn't.
I thought I could rely on you.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.915
You can! It's just
when I hear a cat meow,

11:32.008 --> 11:33.358
it raises the oxytocin levels
in my brain,

11:33.509 --> 11:35.418
and then all I can focus on
is the cat crying,

11:35.420 --> 11:37.437
so really, part of the blame
goes to science.

11:37.589 --> 11:38.980
We're never gonna
get those sneakers.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.257
So when CJ gets back,
what do I give him?

11:41.350 --> 11:42.608
Quality time with his dad?

11:42.761 --> 11:44.351
He'd probably really like that.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.704
How's that gonna help him
keep it fresh on the playground?

11:45.855 --> 11:49.040
"Hey, guys, I know
I'm wearing last year's kicks,

11:49.267 --> 11:51.692
but my dad really loves me."

11:52.528 --> 11:54.879
Carter, I really believe
there is still a chance.

11:55.031 --> 11:58.425
That sounded way more confident
than I feel.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.887
Your boss has such gall.

12:03.114 --> 12:06.373
"I need 'U' to work on Sun."

12:06.393 --> 12:07.800
The man doesn't
respect you enough

12:07.894 --> 12:09.452
-to finish a word.
-Right?

12:09.545 --> 12:10.729
Man, I hate that.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.455
Like Carter left me this note,

12:12.548 --> 12:15.233
"C-H-K I-D-S."

12:15.384 --> 12:17.736
Somebody tell me,
what is "chick ids"?

12:17.963 --> 12:20.387
I think he means, "Check IDs."

12:20.407 --> 12:22.574
Oh. Oh...

12:22.743 --> 12:25.076
Son, don't drink that!

12:28.064 --> 12:30.490
Oscar, your problem is,
you're too nice.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.084
You're right.
That's why I got "Ol' Smelly"

12:33.236 --> 12:37.330
and some stranger's basic ass
is on my carefully formed seat.

12:37.482 --> 12:40.241
People take advantage
of nice people.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.819
Are you still coming over
Saturday to hang my shelves?

12:42.821 --> 12:43.820
9:00.

12:43.913 --> 12:45.505
8:00 would be better.
Bring bagels.

12:45.657 --> 12:46.580
What kind?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.750
I don't want to tell you
what to do.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.585
Look, you can be honest with me.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.513
Just tell me what you
didn't like about it,

12:53.665 --> 12:55.515
as long as it doesn't
hurt my feelings.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.609
Okay, the truth?

12:58.670 --> 12:59.611
It's a good song.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.854
It just doesn't sound like you.

13:02.007 --> 13:05.358
You're Singer-Songwriter Guy,
not whatever that was.

13:05.510 --> 13:06.859
Were you rapping at one point?

13:07.012 --> 13:10.863
That's talk singing,
like T-Pain or T-Boz.

13:11.016 --> 13:12.207
It's a thing.

13:13.351 --> 13:15.368
Max, it doesn't matter
if I like it.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.628
Do you like it?

13:17.539 --> 13:18.871
This is what sells.

13:19.024 --> 13:21.782
This is what they want,
a song with a focused lyric,

13:21.802 --> 13:24.694
a memorable hook, and a fresh
radio-friendly melody.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.789
Did you search
"How to write a hit song"?

13:28.809 --> 13:31.367
(chuckles awkwardly)
No.

13:31.369 --> 13:34.979
Okay, I'm gonna say this,
artist to artist.

13:35.131 --> 13:37.482
We can never really know
what they want.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.559
We can aim for the bull's-eye,
but they'll probably

13:39.653 --> 13:40.819
move the target.

13:41.046 --> 13:43.655
There's no guarantee anyone
will buy our work,

13:43.806 --> 13:47.550
so shouldn't it at least be
something that we like?

13:48.887 --> 13:51.704
I knew there was a reason
I obsessed over your opinion.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.332
Thanks.

13:54.559 --> 13:57.001
Okay, I will leave you
to your night alone.

13:57.153 --> 13:59.170
Thank you.
(chuckles)

13:59.397 --> 14:02.423
I need fresh eyes on my penises.

14:03.902 --> 14:05.593
Of course you do.

14:07.572 --> 14:09.848
Okay, I did some recon.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.498
According to the manager,

14:11.518 --> 14:12.758
there are eight pairs
of size nines left.

14:12.927 --> 14:15.761
But only seven people
in front of us want a nine.

14:15.930 --> 14:17.763
There were eight,
but I talked some kid

14:17.932 --> 14:20.416
into paying his rent instead
because come on.

14:20.435 --> 14:23.194
So that means there's still
one pair left for us!

14:23.346 --> 14:25.421
-You're sure?
-Hundo.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.257
Sorry, man, we just sold
our last nines.

14:28.351 --> 14:30.535
What? That's impossible.

14:30.762 --> 14:33.371
No, I did the math,
and it's like beginner algebra.

14:33.522 --> 14:34.931
I've been doing it
since I was a toddler.

14:34.949 --> 14:37.191
Literally. There was
an article about me.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.602
I'm so not high enough for this.

14:39.621 --> 14:42.605
I know for a fact that you
have one pair of nines left,

14:42.607 --> 14:44.215
and we are not
leaving here without them.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.677
Kat, stop! We're not
getting the damn shoes!

14:50.131 --> 14:53.474
This would never happen
at Dillard's.

14:58.547 --> 15:00.473
They look so real.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.218
Too real. Like I could get
pregnant just looking at 'em.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.388
Nurse Nelson texted me
a picture of his "cookie."

15:07.482 --> 15:11.134
I may have studied it
a little too long.

15:11.894 --> 15:14.579
Maybe split the difference
between abstract and,

15:14.730 --> 15:17.140
"Hey, there's
Phil's boyfriend's junk."

15:17.233 --> 15:20.159
It's so good having
an artist in residence.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.661
All right, I'm going up.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.088
I think there's still time
to have a little of my night.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.572
My life is ruined!

15:25.667 --> 15:27.333
And I set myself up for that.

15:27.485 --> 15:28.818
What happened?

15:29.821 --> 15:32.430
And if I wasn't so nice,
I'd tell him, "You're a bully,

15:32.581 --> 15:33.914
"and nobody likes you.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.842
"Walking around with that
'World's Best Boss' mug--

15:36.937 --> 15:38.177
"you know you bought it
yourself!

15:38.271 --> 15:39.495
And you know
there's booze in that cup."

15:39.664 --> 15:41.330
Oh, wait, wait a minute.
Your-your phone is

15:41.349 --> 15:42.515
typing everything you're saying.

15:42.667 --> 15:43.666
Oh, no, no, be careful.

15:43.685 --> 15:45.276
You hit the voice-texting icon.

15:45.428 --> 15:47.353
Oh, yeah, I can get rid of that,
I'll just...

15:47.505 --> 15:48.671
(phone whooshes)

15:48.840 --> 15:49.839
She hit the arrow?

15:49.932 --> 15:51.265
Yes! She sent that text
to my boss.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.451
-Oh, dear.
-Maybe he won't see it.

15:53.678 --> 15:55.269
Yeah, yeah, no one checks
their texts anymore.

15:55.363 --> 15:58.681
-(phone blips)
-Oh, God, he wants me
to call him.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.349
I knew that would happen.

16:00.368 --> 16:02.535
Okay, we've got to
come up with a story.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.869
Your phone was stolen.

16:04.022 --> 16:05.188
Or you were hacked.

16:05.281 --> 16:06.706
Or you were kidnapped
and forced to text.

16:06.858 --> 16:09.783
You guys, none of these ideas
are going to work.

16:09.877 --> 16:12.878
There's only one way to play
this: you've got to own it.

16:13.047 --> 16:14.722
(sighs)

16:16.959 --> 16:19.202
I think we could've spent
a little more time

16:19.220 --> 16:21.229
on that kidnapping idea.

16:24.559 --> 16:27.560
Hey. I'm really sorry.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.136
This day sucks.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.546
First that phone call, now this.

16:30.639 --> 16:32.715
What happened on the phone call?
Is CJ okay?

16:32.734 --> 16:37.495
He's fine. He just told me that
Xavier proposed to Stephanie

16:37.646 --> 16:39.238
on the slopes today.

16:40.058 --> 16:42.241
So, my ex-wife
is getting married.

16:42.393 --> 16:45.503
Oh, wow. That's a big deal.

16:45.696 --> 16:49.156
So... are you worried about
CJ having a stepdad?

16:49.175 --> 16:50.842
CJ and I are solid.

16:50.993 --> 16:53.660
It's just... when Stephanie
and I got divorced,

16:53.755 --> 16:55.013
everything became a competition.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.075
She got the house,
she got primary custody of CJ.

16:59.093 --> 17:00.834
And now she's engaged.

17:00.928 --> 17:02.762
It's like she won
the "moving on" race.

17:02.914 --> 17:05.931
Hey, you're moving on, too.
And you've got Randi.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.509
I do. And I'm
pretty sure one day,

17:08.603 --> 17:10.452
she's going to let me
call her my girlfriend.

17:10.454 --> 17:12.012
(laughs)

17:12.032 --> 17:13.364
I know I'm being stupid.

17:13.516 --> 17:16.776
No. No, you're not.
I totally get it.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.611
You know, when I first
left teaching,

17:18.687 --> 17:20.872
I was still so caught up
with everything

17:21.099 --> 17:22.356
that was going on there--

17:22.450 --> 17:23.949
like-like who got published,
and who got tenure,

17:24.102 --> 17:27.286
and did Franklin ever fess up
to breaking my RBG bobblehead?

17:27.438 --> 17:29.272
Because I know he was
the last one to see her intact.

17:29.365 --> 17:32.775
I don't know how you got out
of that math department alive.

17:32.794 --> 17:33.959
Right?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.779
I'm just saying that one day
I finally realized

17:36.798 --> 17:39.949
that I had started
a whole new chapter of my life

17:39.967 --> 17:41.117
and I was happy.

17:41.210 --> 17:42.393
I didn't need to keep

17:42.562 --> 17:44.562
obsessing about everything
that was going on there

17:44.789 --> 17:47.973
because it just had nothing
to do with me anymore.

17:48.126 --> 17:49.609
Are you happy?

17:50.553 --> 17:51.718
I am.

17:51.738 --> 17:56.074
Then turn the page.
Start that new chapter.

17:56.968 --> 17:58.725
You know what I learned
about you tonight?

17:58.820 --> 18:00.469
You are a pretty good
line buddy.

18:00.563 --> 18:04.415
And this wasn't a complete loss,
'cause, hey, I nailed that solo.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.750
-(laughs): Yeah, you did.
-Yeah, I did.

18:05.977 --> 18:08.644
-Yeah, I killed it.
-I know, I know,

18:08.663 --> 18:11.005
but he really needs this.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.483
Have a great night.

18:14.502 --> 18:17.486
Randi, you were so right,
owning it was the way to go.

18:17.505 --> 18:20.414
See? He respected you
for telling the truth.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.657
No, he was furious.

18:21.676 --> 18:23.159
I have to work Sundays
for the next month.

18:23.177 --> 18:24.936
But I got my truck back.

18:25.087 --> 18:28.272
Well, then my work here
is done. Isn't it?

18:28.499 --> 18:29.165
I'm good.

18:29.183 --> 18:30.499
-I'm good.
-I'm good.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.593
Yup. My new penises are
in the oven.

18:32.687 --> 18:34.837
Now I've got to start
on the lady parts.

18:34.856 --> 18:37.506
But I'm a little nervous
because it's been a long time

18:37.600 --> 18:39.659
-since I've seen...
-Oh, good Lord!

18:42.438 --> 18:46.682
Thank you. Now, what about...
downstairs?

18:46.775 --> 18:48.501
No!

18:52.874 --> 18:55.758
We are so not there yet, Phil.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.680
-(knock on door)
-(moans)

19:01.957 --> 19:03.141
Hey!

19:03.959 --> 19:05.626
You're gonna play me an
acoustic version of that song,

19:05.720 --> 19:06.535
aren't you?

19:06.629 --> 19:09.981
Buckle up, it's slow and sad.

19:10.132 --> 19:12.708
Fine, but I'm listening
from the tub.

19:12.801 --> 19:15.802

-Oh, all right, kitty,

19:23.479 --> 19:25.070
let's get you back to the café.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.723
But before we go, can you
tell Carter you love him?

19:27.816 --> 19:29.074
It would really help.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.910
Come on, just one "I love you."

19:31.078 --> 19:33.546
-(meows)
-I'll take it.

19:33.697 --> 19:35.915
No way! Is that Larry?

19:36.067 --> 19:37.008
He didn't say.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.235
Larry, my man!

19:39.237 --> 19:40.736
It's my boss's cat.

19:40.755 --> 19:43.014
I let him out this morning
by mistake and he's freaking.

19:43.165 --> 19:46.091
Oh, well, I'm so glad
Larry's found his home again.

19:46.168 --> 19:47.576
Looks like you'll be the hero.

19:47.595 --> 19:48.744
I know, right?

19:48.763 --> 19:53.265
Unless... I want to be the hero.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.527
You know, I have heard
that sometimes

19:56.679 --> 19:59.197
employees will hold back
a couple of pairs,

19:59.348 --> 20:01.257
buy them with their discount,
then jack up the price

20:01.350 --> 20:02.849
and sell them online.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.369
There wouldn't happen to be
a pair of nines in the back,

20:05.521 --> 20:06.662
would there?

20:09.116 --> 20:11.358
Fine. I'll ring them up for you.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.463
Ah-ah-ah.
Shoes first, then the cat.

20:17.442 --> 20:19.792
Damn, girl, you came to play.

20:19.944 --> 20:20.960
Hundo.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.470
(laughs)

20:28.043 --> 20:29.560
You know, it kind of helps
if I break the cookies

20:29.787 --> 20:32.045
into pieces-- then I don't
really know what I'm eating.

20:32.139 --> 20:34.139
That's a left butt cheek.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.049
I don't think you got my point.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.050
That's part of a testicle.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.978
-Okay.
-All right,

20:39.130 --> 20:40.963
tell CJ I'll pick him up
in the morning.

20:40.982 --> 20:42.439
Hey, Steph.

20:42.592 --> 20:45.468
Congratulations,
I'm happy for you.

20:45.561 --> 20:46.652
See you tomorrow.

20:46.729 --> 20:47.970
Where's Darren?

20:48.063 --> 20:49.080
Carter fired him.

20:49.231 --> 20:51.140
Tell me, what does
this text say?

20:51.233 --> 20:52.566
Uh, "C-H-K D-O-B."

20:52.660 --> 20:53.976
Check date of birth.

20:54.069 --> 20:56.328
Darren thought it meant
"chicks dance on bar."

20:56.422 --> 21:00.483
And if you look at
his Instagram, they did.
