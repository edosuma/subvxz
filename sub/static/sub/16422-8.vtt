MAN: Jack, are you all right?

49:22.655 --> 49:25.022
Our work is done.

49:32.388 --> 49:33.355
Hey.

49:46.755 --> 49:48.121
(GRUNTS)

49:48.122 --> 49:50.989
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

49:51.822 --> 49:53.755
It stops here.

49:55.488 --> 50:00.288
You take this further...
you go to anyone...

50:01.156 --> 50:04.320
you keep up your shit to this family,

50:04.321 --> 50:07.954
I will come after you... or they will.

50:07.955 --> 50:09.588
And they'll finish you off.

50:10.156 --> 50:12.222
They got nothing left to lose.

50:12.955 --> 50:15.989
And there's scores more like
them to take their place.

50:16.889 --> 50:18.488
You hear me?

50:19.522 --> 50:21.555
Get him out of here, boys. Come on.

50:24.789 --> 50:27.288
(GROANS)

50:30.022 --> 50:32.555
(DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS)

50:49.455 --> 50:51.256
I understand.

50:52.421 --> 50:54.022
Do you?

50:55.455 --> 50:57.222
I do.

50:59.822 --> 51:01.088
Come on.

51:01.089 --> 51:03.754
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

51:03.755 --> 51:05.488
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

51:10.189 --> 51:12.188
Are you cross?

51:12.189 --> 51:13.355
No.

51:19.955 --> 51:21.554
Are the men being looked after?

51:21.555 --> 51:22.922
Oh, yes.

51:24.555 --> 51:27.755
No man has ever done anything
like that for me before.

51:30.889 --> 51:33.688
Well, he's a very determined young man.

51:34.488 --> 51:36.488
I didn't mean Jack.

51:39.122 --> 51:41.088
I've never been able to acknowledge

51:41.089 --> 51:43.921
that a man could be as strong as I am...

51:43.922 --> 51:46.488
as I <i>think</i> I am.

51:48.889 --> 51:50.321
Thank you.

51:56.688 --> 51:59.521
And, you know, I've just
realized all this...

51:59.522 --> 52:02.222
fatalism about my health...

52:04.222 --> 52:07.121
I really, really don't want to die.
