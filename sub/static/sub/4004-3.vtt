11:04.959 --> 11:08.792
BUT I REALLY THINK YOUR SON
IS GONNA BE PERFECTLY FINE.

11:10.583 --> 11:15.041
[baby crying]

11:15.041 --> 11:17.208
- OOH.

11:17.208 --> 11:21.250
HE WANTS HIS HEAD BACK.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.041
AHH.

11:23.041 --> 11:25.500
- CHILDREN HARRISON'S AGE
CAN EXHIBIT

11:25.500 --> 11:27.625
WHAT MIGHT SEEM
LIKE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR,

11:27.625 --> 11:29.333
BUT THEY'RE JUST
RELEASING ENERGY.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.959
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT
TO READ INTO IT.

11:31.959 --> 11:35.667
- I'LL TRY NOT TO.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.250
- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

11:38.250 --> 11:39.667
IS TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.875
FIND SOME TIME TO RELEASE
YOUR OWN ENERGY.

11:42.875 --> 11:47.667
DO SOMETHING FOR DEXTER.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.417
- DEXTER WILL.

11:50.417 --> 11:53.208
- I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.667
I DIDN'T SEE NO ONE.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.375
- WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING

11:56.375 --> 11:58.875
OR IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING--

11:58.875 --> 11:59.917
- YES, MM-HMM.

11:59.917 --> 12:02.542
I CALL YOU.
[speaking Spanish]

12:02.542 --> 12:04.583
- [sighs]

12:04.583 --> 12:06.542
- WE'RE NEVER GONNA HEAR
FROM HER.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.959
ALL THIS NO TALKING
IS FUCKING FRUSTRATING.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.834
- YEAH.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.375
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FRUSTRATING?

12:12.375 --> 12:14.291
9 DAYS, 13 HOURS.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.542
- WHAT?

12:15.542 --> 12:17.500
- SINCE WE--YOU KNOW?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.041
JUST--
- YOU'RE COUNTING?

12:19.041 --> 12:21.333
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
I HAVE AN INTERNAL CLOCK.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.291
- WELL, UNPLUG IT.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.834
- I'M JUST SAYING,
AT THIS POINT,

12:24.834 --> 12:26.375
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE MARRIED.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.500
- SHIT ON MY FACE.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.208
YOU EVER WORDS LIKE
"WE" AND "MARRIED"

12:29.208 --> 12:31.083
IN THE SAME FUCKING
SENTENCE AGAIN--

12:31.083 --> 12:32.375
- WHOA.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.083
- ANOTHER CASE
OF TEMPORARY BLINDNESS.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.083
ANYTHING?

12:35.083 --> 12:36.458
- THESE PEOPLE ARE
ALL AFRAID OF SOMETHING.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.375
- YEAH, I'M GETTING THAT TOO.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.834
- MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T WANT
TO GET INVOLVED.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.250
- NO, I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.375
IF THE KILLER'S DEAD,
WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF?

12:43.375 --> 12:44.709
- I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE
SOME HEADWAY,

12:44.709 --> 12:47.291
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS
IS A VENEZUELAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.875
- SO?
- I'M CUBAN.

12:48.875 --> 12:52.083
OFFICER MANZON'S
FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.417
- MANZON?

12:53.417 --> 12:54.500
- SHE'S A UNIFORM,
BUT SHE MIGHT

12:54.500 --> 12:55.750
BE WORTH BRINGING IN.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.375
- SHE THINKS THESE ARE
ABOUT RELIGIOUS MURDERS.

12:57.375 --> 12:58.417
SANTA MIERDA.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.250
[laughter]

13:00.250 --> 13:02.875
- THAT'S SANTA MUERTE.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.250
IT'S "SAINT DEATH,"

13:04.250 --> 13:05.792
NOT "SAINT SHIT."

13:05.792 --> 13:07.792
AND MANZON MIGHT
BE ON TO SOMETHING.

13:07.792 --> 13:09.792
MIGHT EXPLAIN
WHY NO ONE'S TALKING.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.291
- SHUT UP.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.166
- [chuckles]

13:29.208 --> 13:31.959
[keypad tones]

13:31.959 --> 13:33.458
[cell phone trilling]

13:33.458 --> 13:35.500
- HELLO?
- HI, IT'S DEXTER.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.750
- HI.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.250
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I MENTIONED,

13:38.250 --> 13:39.917
BUT FOR HIS NAP,
HARRISON LIKES

13:39.917 --> 13:42.625
THE PUPPY BLANKET
JUST TOUCHING HIS FACE.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.792
- IT'S ON YOUR CHECKLIST.

13:44.792 --> 13:48.583
UH, ITEM EIGHT UNDER
"SLEEP PREFERENCES."

13:48.583 --> 13:51.792
- OKAY, GOOD.
HOW'S HE DOING?

13:51.792 --> 13:54.125
- WE JUST READ
THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR

13:54.125 --> 13:56.166
FOR THE SEVENTH TIME.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.709
- DON'T WORRY.

13:57.709 --> 14:02.333
HE USUALLY GETS SICK
OF IT AROUND THE 20TH READ.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.375
I GOTTA GO.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.250
[chuckles]

14:07.250 --> 14:09.583
YEAH, YOU CALL ME
IF THERE'S ANYTHING.

14:09.583 --> 14:14.000
THOUGHT HE'D NEVER SPOT ME.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
- [chuckles]

14:16.000 --> 14:19.667
SOME COINKYDINK, HUH?

14:19.667 --> 14:21.250
YOU FIND ANY MORE
DEAD ANIMALS?

14:21.250 --> 14:24.125
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
WORKING ON SOMETHING.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.208
- TASTES A LOT BETTER
THAN IT LOOKS.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.458
- HAVE A SEAT.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.250
- BOYD FOWLER.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.208
- DARYL TUCKER.

14:40.208 --> 14:41.500
- YOU WORK AROUND HERE?

14:41.500 --> 14:47.041
- I JUST LOVE THE ARABICA.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.542
ACTUALLY, I'M BETWEEN JOBS.

14:48.542 --> 14:51.875
HENCE THE WANT ADS.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.000
- WHAT KIND OF WORK
YOU LOOKING FOR?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
- OH, NOT CHOOSY.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.917
WHATEVER PAYS AND
GETS ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

14:59.917 --> 15:01.750
YOU LIKE WHAT YOU DO?

15:01.750 --> 15:04.542
- I LOVE IT.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.125
PROBABLY WOULDN'T THINK SO,
DRIVING AROUND,

15:06.125 --> 15:07.375
PICKING UP DEAD ANIMALS.

15:07.375 --> 15:10.667
- EH, BEATS WORKING
IN A CUBICLE.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.875
YOU GET OUT IN THE FRESH AIR.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.834
WELL, I GUESS MOST
OF THE TIME IT'S FRESH.

15:14.834 --> 15:18.792
- [chuckles]
IT'S NOT BORING.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.834
NEVER KNOW WHAT'S
AROUND THE NEXT BEND.

15:20.834 --> 15:26.500
FULL OF SURPRISES.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.250
YOU KNOW...

15:28.250 --> 15:29.750
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
WE MIGHT HAVE

15:29.750 --> 15:30.792
AN OPENING AT ANIMAL PICKUP.

15:30.792 --> 15:31.959
- REALLY?

15:31.959 --> 15:33.750
- YEAH, THERE AIN'T EXACTLY
A LINE EITHER.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.667
[laughter]

15:36.667 --> 15:37.583
YOU SHOULD TAKE A RIDE
WITH ME.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.333
SEE IF YOU LIKE IT.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.542
YOU GOT TO BE OKAY AROUND
DEAD THINGS THOUGH.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.959
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

15:45.959 --> 15:47.792
- GREAT.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.166
TOMORROW MORNING,
8:00 SHARP.

15:49.166 --> 15:52.750
- I WOULD HAVE SETTLED
FOR YOUR WORK SCHEDULE,

15:52.750 --> 15:54.875
BUT THIS COULD BE BETTER.

15:54.875 --> 15:59.250
ONLY 24 HOURS TO GET READY.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.917
BOYD'S PATROL ROUTE.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.542
NEED TO FIND A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN SPEND

16:03.542 --> 16:07.959
SOME QUALITY TIME.

16:07.959 --> 16:11.000
THERE.

16:18.792 --> 16:23.125
AN OLD TOURIST WELCOME CENTER.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.125
NOT VERY WELCOMING NOW.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.333
TOTALLY ISOLATED.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.041
THANK YOU, CITY OF MIAMI.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.166
- YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM
IN DAYLIGHT?

16:47.166 --> 16:48.959
- DOESN'T MATTER OUT THIS FAR.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.417
- IT'S STILL VERY RISKY.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.667
WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES BY?

16:52.667 --> 16:55.792
- THAT COULD ALSO HAPPEN
AT NIGHT.

16:55.792 --> 17:00.083
- BUT IT'S A LOT LESS LIKELY.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.542
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT,
DEXTER.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.000
IT'S IMPORTANT.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.083
IT'S YOUR FIRST KILL SINCE--

17:06.083 --> 17:07.875
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
HOW MUCH I NEED THIS.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.917
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.208
- WHAT?

17:11.208 --> 17:13.458
- THIS KILL WON'T PUT
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.750
IT WON'T BRING RITA BACK.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.834
- IT MIGHT BRING ME BACK.

17:17.834 --> 17:18.917
- IF YOU MAKE IT MEAN SO MUCH,

17:18.917 --> 17:20.667
YOU'LL ONLY INVITE MISTAKES.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.208
- I WON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.542
I'M FOLLOWING THE CODE.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.959
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT?

17:24.959 --> 17:29.667
- I ONLY WANT
TO HELP YOU, DEX.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.667
THIS IS A BIG ROOM.

17:31.667 --> 17:35.041
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
ENOUGH PLASTIC.

17:38.125 --> 17:43.542
- IT FEELS GOOD GETTING
THE DETAILS RIGHT.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.875
IT'S MORE THAN JUST PREPARING
A KILL ROOM.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.625
IT'S LIKE I'M PUTTING
MY LIFE BACK IN ORDER.

18:13.834 --> 18:19.542
AND IT'S ALMOST ENOUGH.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.375
ALMOST.

18:22.375 --> 18:27.166
- IF ANYONE KNOWS
ABOUT THESE MURDERS, IT'S FAUZI.

18:27.166 --> 18:32.000
HE KNOWS EVERYBODY
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.125
- YOU REALLY GREW UP
AROUND HERE?

18:34.125 --> 18:35.792
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE A DISABILITY.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.208
- I'M ASKING A QUESTION.

18:37.208 --> 18:40.166
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO BURN A CROSS.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.041
- I USED TO RIDE MY BIKE
AROUND THIS BLOCK.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.917
THERE WAS THIS MEAN DOG
THAT LIVED THERE.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.083
I MEAN, I USED TO PRAY
TO SAINT ANTHONY

18:45.083 --> 18:46.208
TO MAKE ME INVISIBLE.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.542
I NEVER GOT BIT.

18:47.542 --> 18:49.125
- YOU THINK PRAYER
WAS THE REASON?

18:49.125 --> 18:50.625
- YEAH.

18:50.625 --> 18:53.083
THAT AND SOME HOMEMADE
PEPPER SPRAY.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.291
- [speaking Spanish]

19:07.291 --> 19:09.625
- [speaking Spanish]

19:09.625 --> 19:12.291
- [speaking Spanish]

19:12.291 --> 19:14.583
- [speaking Spanish]

19:19.959 --> 19:21.375
- I WAS SURPRISED YOU CALLED.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.917
THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I SAID AT THE CRIME SCENE.

19:22.917 --> 19:25.875
- WHO SAYS I DO?

19:25.875 --> 19:28.166
AT THIS POINT, YOU CAN'T
RULE ANYTHING OUT.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.542
- WELL, BRINGING ME IN WAS
THE BEST MOVE, DETECTIVE.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.542
YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

19:50.834 --> 19:55.375
- [speaking Spanish]

19:55.375 --> 19:56.834
- ASK HIM IF HE'S HEARD
OF THE DEATHS

19:56.834 --> 19:59.458
OF MR. AND MRS. ALFARO.

19:59.458 --> 20:00.834
- [speaking Spanish]

20:00.834 --> 20:06.417
- [speaking Spanish]

20:06.417 --> 20:10.917
- THIS WAS FOUND
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.375
DID HE SELL IT TO MR. ALFARO?

20:12.375 --> 20:16.083
- [speaking Spanish]

20:16.083 --> 20:18.875
- [speaking Spanish]

20:18.875 --> 20:24.750
[continues in Spanish]

20:24.750 --> 20:26.709
- HE SAYS ALFARO
WAS A STRICT CATHOLIC.

20:26.709 --> 20:29.125
CAME IN TO THE STORE NOW
AND THEN TO BUY SOME THINGS,

20:29.125 --> 20:31.000
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CAUGHT DEAD BACK HERE.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.709
- DID HE SELL IT
TO ANYONE ELSE?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.750
- [speaking Spanish]

20:34.750 --> 20:37.208
- [speaking Spanish]

20:37.208 --> 20:40.500
[continues in Spanish]

20:40.500 --> 20:42.792
- HE SAYS HE DOESN'T KEEP TRACK
OF WHO BUYS WHAT,

20:42.792 --> 20:44.667
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN THIS SHIT.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.208
- IS THAT WHY HE HAS
THE TATTOO?

20:47.208 --> 20:49.917
- I GOT DRUNK ONE NIGHT,
WOKE UP,

20:49.917 --> 20:51.625
IT WAS THERE.

20:51.625 --> 20:56.417
YOU TELL ME.

20:56.417 --> 20:57.750
[speaking Spanish]

20:57.750 --> 20:59.458
- [speaking Spanish]

20:59.458 --> 21:03.208
- [speaking Spanish]

21:03.208 --> 21:05.542
- HEY, HEY.
WE WERE DOING GREAT IN ENGLISH.

21:05.542 --> 21:06.917
- YOU LIVE IN MIAMI.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.458
WHY YOU NO LEARN SPANISH?

21:08.458 --> 21:13.417
- BECAUSE ME TOO BUSY
MAKING A LIVING.

21:13.417 --> 21:15.834
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN TELL US?

21:15.834 --> 21:18.250
ANYTHING THAT WILL HELP US
WITH THIS CASE?

21:18.250 --> 21:20.125
- [speaking Spanish]

21:23.250 --> 21:24.875
- FAUZI'S HOLDING BACK.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.709
I SHOULD HAVE TALKED
TO HIM BY MYSELF.

21:26.709 --> 21:28.083
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IN A MORE SHARING MOOD

21:28.083 --> 21:29.667
WITH SOMEONE HE KNOWS.
- OH, YEAH?

21:29.667 --> 21:30.834
MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE
SAID NOTHING

21:30.834 --> 21:34.959
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:34.959 --> 21:36.917
- HEY, I KNOW YOU'RE
UP AGAINST IT,

21:36.917 --> 21:39.125
BUT YOU MIGHT JUST WANT
TO TAKE A BREATH.

21:39.125 --> 21:44.041
- [sighs]

21:44.041 --> 21:46.125
WHY DON'T WE GIVE HIM THE NIGHT
TO STEW OVER THIS

21:46.125 --> 21:48.583
AND THEN YOU COME
VISIT HIM TOMORROW ALONE?

21:48.583 --> 21:51.417
- FINE.

22:11.125 --> 22:14.667
- SONYA?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.500
SONYA?

22:19.834 --> 22:23.000
WHERE ARE THEY?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
[cell phone dialing]

22:25.000 --> 22:27.208
- HI, THIS IS SONYA.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.375
- YEAH, IT'S DEXTER.

22:28.375 --> 22:29.917
I JUST GOT BACK
AND YOU'RE NOT HERE

22:29.917 --> 22:30.917
AND NOT ANSWERING YOUR CELL.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.917
CALL ME NOW.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.333
CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK THE WORST.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.458
HARRISON'S BEEN STOLEN.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.458
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HIM
WITH A STRANGER.

22:38.458 --> 22:43.250
RITA WOULD HAVE NEVER
ALLOWED IT.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.291

22:49.959 --> 22:51.458

WHERE WERE YOU?

22:51.458 --> 22:53.667
- WELL, HE WAS KEYED UP AFTER
HIS YO GABBA GABBA  VIDEOS.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.625
I THOUGHT SOME FRESH AIR
WOULD MAKE HIM DROWSY.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.625
IT WORKED.

22:58.625 --> 23:00.000
- YOU DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR CELL.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.875
- WELL, I HAD MY HANDS FULL.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.625
OH, I LEFT A NOTE
ON THE FRIDGE.

23:06.625 --> 23:09.875
OH, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO WORRY YOU.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.417
- NO, IT'S FINE.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.542
I'M JUST...
[sighs]

23:13.542 --> 23:15.667
I'M NOT USED TO CHECKING
THE FRIDGE FOR NOTES.

23:15.667 --> 23:18.041
JUST MESSAGES
FROM OTHER SERIAL KILLERS.

23:18.041 --> 23:21.458
- OH, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.208
- DON'T.
YOU WERE JUST DOING YOUR JOB.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.750
HEY, I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.542
[elevator bell dings]

23:37.542 --> 23:40.667

[sighs]
THANKS.

23:45.250 --> 23:49.500

23:49.500 --> 23:50.500

23:50.500 --> 23:52.041
- OH, GOOD.

23:52.041 --> 23:53.792
'CAUSE I WON'T BE THERE
TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

23:53.792 --> 23:56.291
THERE COULD BE WINGMEN OUT THERE
LOOKING TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.083
- JUST DROP IT.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.917
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
THIS MAN IS A KNIGHT

24:00.917 --> 24:02.250
IN SHINING ARMOR.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.625
YOU SHOULD BE POLISHING
HIS LANCE.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.959
- EXCUSE ME?

24:07.959 --> 24:10.917
- I MEANT THAT
METAPHORICALLY.

24:10.917 --> 24:14.083
NOT...HOW IT SOUNDED.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.834
[elevator bell dings]

24:16.834 --> 24:19.917
GOOD NIGHT.

24:25.333 --> 24:30.458
- OKAY, I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BAR.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.917
- I TOLD YOU IT'S SETTLED.
[speaks Spanish]

24:37.291 --> 24:39.959
- I'M NOT ASKING
AS YOUR WIFE.

24:39.959 --> 24:43.583
- VINCE AND I WERE HAVING
DRINKS, KEEPING TO OURSELVES.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.625
AND THEN OUT OF THE BLUE,

24:44.625 --> 24:46.291
SERGEANT LOPEZ STARTS
TALKING SHIT.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.208
- WHAT SHIT?

24:48.208 --> 24:50.333
- YOU KNOW...SHIT.
HE WAS OUT OF LINE.

24:50.333 --> 24:53.583
- SPECIFICS.

24:56.792 --> 24:58.917
- [sighs]

24:58.917 --> 25:00.625
HE ASKED IF YOU
AND I WERE MARRIED.

25:00.625 --> 25:05.583
THEN HE SAID YOU WERE
A FINE PIECE OF ASS.

25:05.583 --> 25:07.834
AND YOU WERE MY SUGAR MAMA.

25:07.834 --> 25:09.000
- SUGAR MAMA?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.166
- YEAH,
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY BOSS

25:10.166 --> 25:12.000
AND YOUR PAYCHECK
HAS MORE ZEROS.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.417
- DOES THAT REALLY
BOTHER YOU?

25:13.417 --> 25:14.583
- A LITTLE.

25:14.583 --> 25:16.834
DO YOU KNOW ANY GUYS
IT WOULDN'T BOTHER?

25:16.834 --> 25:18.667
- SO YOU HIT HIM?

25:18.667 --> 25:19.834
- NO, THERE'S MORE.

25:19.834 --> 25:20.959
- MORE?

25:20.959 --> 25:23.875
- YOU WANTED
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

25:23.875 --> 25:29.125
HE THEN SAID YOU GAVE
THE BEST BLOWJOBS IN MIAMI.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.125
AND THEN I HIT HIM.

25:35.125 --> 25:40.000
AND HE'S LUCKY THAT'S
ALL I DID.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.834
- [sighs]

25:45.166 --> 25:49.166
ANGEL, I'M A WOMAN
IN A POSITION OF POWER.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.750
SOME MEN HAVE TROUBLE
DEALING WITH THAT,

25:51.750 --> 25:53.250
SO THEY SPREAD
GARBAGE AROUND.

25:53.250 --> 25:57.625
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

25:57.625 --> 26:02.041
AND I'M TRYING
TO WORK THROUGH IT.

26:02.041 --> 26:05.125
- COULD YOU WORK THROUGH
IT WITHOUT THE BAR FIGHTS?

26:05.125 --> 26:07.875
- I'LL KEEP THE BAR FIGHTS
AT A MINIMUM.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.291
- HE SLEEPING?

26:16.291 --> 26:21.959

LIKE A BABY.

26:21.959 --> 26:24.792
HOW WAS WORK?

26:24.792 --> 26:26.792
- DIRE.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.750
I'VE BEEN SADDLED WITH
THIS UNIFORM ON A HOMICIDE CASE

26:29.750 --> 26:33.375
AND SHE'S DRIVING ME
APE-ASS CRAZY.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.291
HOW'S THE NANNY?

26:35.291 --> 26:38.500
- ASIDE FROM A LITTLE
MESSAGE HICCUP--

26:38.500 --> 26:42.542
IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT--
SHE DID GREAT.

26:42.542 --> 26:45.583
- I WONDER WHY SHE
LEFT IRELAND.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.583
MAYBE SHE'S RUNNING
FROM SOMETHING.

26:47.583 --> 26:48.709
- I DON'T KNOW, DEB.

26:48.709 --> 26:52.792
MAYBE YOU BETTER CHECK
INTERPOL.

26:52.792 --> 26:54.959
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'D YOU DO TODAY?

26:54.959 --> 26:56.083
- NOT MUCH.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.208
CODY CALLED.

26:58.208 --> 27:01.750
HE WANTED ME TO SEND
MY RECIPE FOR PANCAKES.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.542
- HOW ARE THEY?

27:03.542 --> 27:07.625
- CODY SOUNDS...

27:07.625 --> 27:10.500
HAPPIER.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.250
ASTOR WOULDN'T COME
TO THE PHONE.

27:12.250 --> 27:17.792
- SHE'LL COME AROUND, DEX.

27:17.792 --> 27:20.125
- WELL, OTHER THAN THAT,
I RAN SOME ERRANDS.

27:20.125 --> 27:23.208
- THAT'S GOOD.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.166
GET BACK IN YOUR ROUTINE.

27:25.166 --> 27:27.875
WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE CLOSE,
ROUTINE CAN BE A LADDER

27:27.875 --> 27:30.750
THAT CAN HELP YOU CLIMB BACK
INTO SOME KIND OF NORMALCY.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.625
- WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

27:36.625 --> 27:41.500
- I AM CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT
THOUGHT, DEXTER.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.125
OPRAH.

27:43.125 --> 27:44.166
[laughter]

27:44.166 --> 27:46.291
I WATCHED HER
WHEN I WAS LAID UP.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.375
THAT'S GOOD.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.417
KEEP GETTING BETTER, DEX.

27:52.417 --> 27:56.000
- I'LL TRY.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.583
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A DEAD ANIMAL.

28:01.583 --> 28:06.041
UH, COUNTY ROAD 5,
MILE MARKER 31.

28:06.041 --> 28:07.083
I'M NOT SURE.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.834
I THINK IT WAS A GATOR.

28:08.834 --> 28:11.917
IT WAS LONG AND SCALY.

28:11.917 --> 28:16.834
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

28:16.834 --> 28:20.208
IT'S ON BOYD'S CIRCUIT,
SO HE'LL GET THE CALL.

28:20.208 --> 28:22.000
WHEN HE DOES, BOYD WILL
TAKE A LITTLE NAP

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
AND WAKE UP IN THE TOURIST
WELCOME CENTER,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.417
BUT HE WON'T BE COLLECTING
ANY BROCHURES.

28:28.417 --> 28:32.250
- WASN'T SURE YOU'D BE HERE.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.500
- WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.875
- HEY, I'M A SAFETY GUY.

28:35.875 --> 28:38.709
- RIGHT.

28:38.709 --> 28:41.417
NEVER BE TOO SAFE.

28:41.417 --> 28:43.041
WHERE WE OFF TO FIRST?

28:43.041 --> 28:46.542
- DEAD CAT ON LINDGREN.
BORING.

28:46.542 --> 28:48.417
PRETTY NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGH.

28:48.417 --> 28:52.417
LOT OF TROPHY WIVES OUT
JOGGING AT THIS HOUR.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.458
- [chuckles]
THERE'S A BONUS.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.750
- YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE THE NOW.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.375
EVERY SECOND YOU WASTE
IS ONE MORE SECOND

28:58.375 --> 29:00.250
YOU'LL NEVER GET BACK.

29:00.250 --> 29:01.542
- EVER HEAR THIS GUY?

29:01.542 --> 29:03.542
- WHEN I WAS SEARCHING
YOUR HOUSE.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.000
- ANGED MY LIFE.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.375
REALLY HELPED ME SEE
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

29:08.375 --> 29:09.709
DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

29:09.709 --> 29:13.208
EASE YOU THROUGH
THAT DIVORCE.

29:13.208 --> 29:15.333
- DIVORCE?

29:15.333 --> 29:17.750
- RING DENT.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.583
- I DIDN'T WANT BOYD
TO KNOW THAT PART OF MY LIFE.

29:20.583 --> 29:23.041
FOR A ROADKILL JANITOR,
HE DOESN'T MISS MUCH.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.917
- HOPE IT'S NOT
A TOUCHY SUBJECT.

29:24.917 --> 29:28.000
- NO, IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.041
- IF YOU NEED HELP
MOVING ON,

29:30.041 --> 29:32.417
LISTEN TO THESE CDs.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.250
- TAKE IT.
- TAKE IT NOW.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.750
THAT'S THE MAIN IDEA.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.542
- TAKE IT NOW?

29:39.542 --> 29:40.875
- THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT,

29:40.875 --> 29:43.125
BUT IT REALLY
MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

29:43.125 --> 29:47.709
OF COURSE, YOU GOT TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO TAKE.

29:49.583 --> 29:54.959
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, DARYL?

29:54.959 --> 29:57.458
- THAT'S KIND OF A
HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.250
- YES, IT IS.

29:59.250 --> 30:02.834
BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S WHAT
WE'RE ON THIS EARTH TO FIND OUT.

30:24.041 --> 30:27.125

30:31.417 --> 30:33.917
NOT THAT I KNOW WHO THAT IS.

THE SANTA MUERTE ICONS

30:42.417 --> 30:44.041

31:01.959 --> 31:04.000
BECAUSE HE JUST MURDERED
HIS WIFE?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.208
WHAT IF HE'S FREAKED OUT BECAUSE
SOMEONE'S GOT HIS WIFE?

31:07.208 --> 31:09.875
- AND THEY'LL KILL HER UNLESS
HE PAYS CASH.

31:09.875 --> 31:11.667
- THIS ISN'T DRUG RELATED.

31:11.667 --> 31:14.917
MAYBE SHE WAS FUCKING
HELD HOSTAGE FOR RANSOM.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.125
YOU THINK FAUZI SPILLED
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.458
- HE'S BEEN ASKING
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

31:18.458 --> 31:19.709
THINKS HE CAN DIG UP
SOME MORE.

31:19.709 --> 31:21.959
- WELL,

THEY MUST HAVE SENT
SOMEONE ELSE.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.125
THAT STINK GETS
IN YOUR SOUL.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.917

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

35:02.917 --> 35:04.959
- A MOTORIST SPOTTED YOU LYING
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

35:04.959 --> 35:07.250
CALLED 911.

35:07.250 --> 35:11.500
SEEMS THIS GUY SHOT YOU
WITH A TRANQ DART.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.083
BOYS HAVE AN ARGUMENT
OR SOMETHING?

35:13.083 --> 35:16.083
- NO.
NO.

35:16.083 --> 35:19.458
WENT OFF BY ACCIDENT.

35:19.458 --> 35:22.250

SUPPOSED TO SHOOT THE GATOR.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.750

YOU FUCKING NUMBSKULL.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.375

35:28.375 --> 35:29.458
- HUH?

35:29.458 --> 35:30.792
- WHY WERE YOU UNCONSCIOUS?

35:30.792 --> 35:34.709
- THEY MUST NOT HAVE FOUND
MY NEEDLE.

35:34.709 --> 35:38.625
- I GUESS I WAS JUST SO UPSET
THAT I PASSED OUT.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.083
- THERE'S ONE PIECE
OF GOOD LUCK.

35:40.083 --> 35:42.208
- I REALLY NEED
TO GET BACK TO MY TRUCK.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.417
- YEAH, SORRY.

35:43.417 --> 35:44.917
I CAN'T LET YOU JUMP OUT
OF A MOVING AMBULANCE.

35:44.917 --> 35:45.959
WE'LL BE THERE SOON.

I'M DR. LORRE.

36:37.125 --> 36:39.166
I UNDERSTAND YOU SUFFERED
A LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.959
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TOLD.

36:40.959 --> 36:42.291
- THAT EVER HAPPEN BEFORE?

36:42.291 --> 36:45.458

36:45.458 --> 36:47.125

OF HEADACHES,

36:47.125 --> 36:48.291
DIZZINESS, BLURRED VISION?

36:48.291 --> 36:49.500
- UH-UH.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.875
- HYPOGLYCEMIA?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.208
- NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.041
- OKAY.

36:54.041 --> 36:55.375
WE'RE GONNA RUN

SEE IF ANYTHING'S
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.875
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
TO DRAW YOUR BLOOD.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.208
JUST LIE STILL.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.542
[overlapping chatter]

37:58.542 --> 37:59.917
- [muttering]

37:59.917 --> 38:01.125
- HE'S IN THERE, OKAY.

38:01.125 --> 38:03.291
JUST GIVE HIM ASPIRIN.
NO PAINKILLERS.

38:03.291 --> 38:04.375
- I'M SORRY, DOCTOR.

38:04.375 --> 38:06.000
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.333
- WELL, YOU GOT TO CHECK THE
PATIENT'S RECORDS HERE, HE'S--

38:08.333 --> 38:10.375
FIFTH TIME HE'S BEEN
IN THE E.R. THIS YEAR.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.542
THIS IS HIS FIFTH ACCIDENT.

38:11.542 --> 38:12.667
- IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

38:12.667 --> 38:17.417
- ALL RIGHT.

[indistinct radio chatter]

38:20.792 --> 38:23.458
- [sighs]

38:23.458 --> 38:25.834
ANOTHER HEAD?

38:25.834 --> 38:28.917
AND I WAS IN
SUCH A GOOD MOOD.

38:33.333 --> 38:34.959
- IT'S MY FAULT.

38:34.959 --> 38:36.792
I GOT HIM KILLED.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.750
- FUCK THAT.
YOU DIDN'T CUT HIS HEAD OFF.

38:38.750 --> 38:42.125
- THEY DID THIS BECAUSE
HE STARTED TALKING TO ME.

38:42.125 --> 38:46.125
IF I HADN'T COME BACK HERE,
FAUZI WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

38:46.125 --> 38:47.375
- IT WAS MY CALL.

38:47.375 --> 38:49.625
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

38:49.625 --> 38:52.875
AND WE'RE CLOSER TO CATCHING HIM
BECAUSE OF YOU, OKAY?

38:52.875 --> 38:54.834
YOU DID GOOD.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.208
- LOOKS LIKE, UH...

38:57.208 --> 39:00.834
THE SAME TREATMENT
AS OUR OTHER, UH, HEAD CASE.

39:00.834 --> 39:04.166
[chuckles]

39:04.166 --> 39:06.542
EYES AND TONGUE
HAVE BEEN EXCISED.

39:06.542 --> 39:08.959
DAMN, DON'T PEOPLE JUST SHOOT
EACH OTHER ANYMORE?

39:08.959 --> 39:11.959
[cell phone rings]

39:11.959 --> 39:13.792

39:15.417 --> 39:18.333
HEY, THANKS
FOR CALLING ME BACK.

39:18.333 --> 39:21.125
- NO PROB.
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.583
WE'RE UP TO OUR NECKS
ON THIS TRINITY THING.

39:22.583 --> 39:25.125
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

39:25.125 --> 39:27.083
I THINK I MAY HAVE
A LEAD ON KYLE BUTLER.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.583
- KYLE BUTLER?

39:28.583 --> 39:30.166
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THE GUY WHO WAS HANGING AROUND

39:30.166 --> 39:31.166
WITH ARTHUR MITCHELL?

39:31.166 --> 39:32.417
- YEAH, I KNOW WHO HE IS.

39:32.417 --> 39:34.625
JUST DIDN'T KNOW YOU PEOPLE
WERE WORKING THIS.

39:34.625 --> 39:37.500
- I'M SORT OF, UH,
FLYING OFF THE RECORD.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.709
LISTEN.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.291
IS THERE ANY CHANCE I COULD TALK
TO THE MITCHELL FAMILY?

39:41.291 --> 39:42.709
- THE MITCHELLS ARE
IN A SAFE HOUSE.

39:42.709 --> 39:44.333
FIRST STOP BEFORE
WITNESS PROTTION.

39:44.333 --> 39:45.542
- JUST WANT TO SHOW THEM
A PHOTO.

39:45.542 --> 39:48.291
TAKE FIVE MINUTES.

39:48.291 --> 39:50.000
- GIVE ME THE PHOTO.
I'LL SHOW IT TO THEM.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.542
- AHH, IT'S TOO SENSITIVE.

39:52.542 --> 39:54.083
IF I'M WRONG,
IT COULD MEAN MY ASS.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.166
COME ON...

39:56.166 --> 39:59.500
RAY, AS A FRIEND.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.917
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO,
BUT NO PROMISES.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.250

40:04.250 --> 40:05.917
LET ME KNOW.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.917
[keypad to]

41:02.667 --> 41:04.500
- TAKE IT.

41:04.500 --> 41:05.792
NOW, BEFORE YOU CAN
TAKE ANYTHING...

41:05.792 --> 41:06.917
- WHAT THE FUCK?

41:06.917 --> 41:08.959
- YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

41:08.959 --> 41:11.667
MAY SOUND EASY, BUT YOU
CAN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

41:11.667 --> 41:13.583
UNLESS YOU KNOW YOURSELF.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.792
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION.

41:16.792 --> 41:19.333
TAKE IT.

41:19.333 --> 41:20.792
YOU WANT THAT PROMOTION?

41:20.792 --> 41:23.375
WELL, THEN TAKE IT.

41:23.375 --> 41:25.583
YOU WANT THAT NEW CAR,
THAT HOUSE?

41:25.583 --> 41:26.583
TAKE IT.

41:26.583 --> 41:31.291
- [grunts]

41:31.291 --> 41:36.083
THAT COULD HAVE GONE SMOOTHER.

41:36.083 --> 41:38.875
COULD HAVE ALSO GONE WORSE.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.750
LEAST HE'S DOWN.

41:48.875 --> 41:50.250
[keypad tones]

41:50.250 --> 41:51.834
[cell phone trilling]

41:51.834 --> 41:53.458
- HELLO?
- HI, IT'S DEXTER.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.208
WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M GONNA

41:55.208 --> 41:56.417
BE A LITTLE LATER
THAN I EXPECTED.

41:56.417 --> 41:57.583
- IT'S NO PROBLEM.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.625
- MY SISTER SHOULD
BE THERE ANY MINUTE THOUGH.

41:59.625 --> 42:02.291
- ACTUALLY, SHE PHONED TOO.
SHE'S TIED UP AT WORK.

42:02.291 --> 42:04.583
- OH.
- IT'S OKAY.

42:04.583 --> 42:06.000
I DON'T MIND STAYING LATE.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.041
I--I LIKE WATCHING HIM SLEEP.

42:08.041 --> 42:09.333
- YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

42:09.333 --> 42:11.000
- I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.250
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

42:12.250 --> 42:14.208
- HE TOOK HIS FIRST EP.

42:14.208 --> 42:17.500
AT LEAST I THINK
IT WAS HIS FIRST.

42:17.500 --> 42:18.667
- HE DID?

42:18.667 --> 42:20.333
- IT WAS ONLY ONE STEP,
BUT YOU COULD TELL

42:20.333 --> 42:22.583
HE WAS REALLY PROUD
OF HIMSELF.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.792
- THAT'S AMAZING.

42:25.792 --> 42:27.208
- I MANAGED
TO GET A SHOT FOR YOU.

42:27.208 --> 42:28.667
CHECK YOUR EMAIL.

42:28.667 --> 42:29.792
- THANKS.

42:29.792 --> 42:31.750
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN
I'M ON MY WAY HOME.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.834
[keypad tones]

42:40.375 --> 42:43.625
MY SON IS WALKING...

42:43.625 --> 42:45.917
LIKE A NORMAL LITTLE BOY.

42:45.917 --> 42:48.000
[sighs]

42:53.375 --> 42:55.166
- I'M ON MY WAY THERE
RIGHT NOW.

42:55.166 --> 42:57.417
JUST START TROLLING
FOR EYEWITNESSES.

42:57.417 --> 42:58.750
MAYBE WE'LL CATCH A BREAK.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.667
MAYBE SOMEONE
SAW SOMETHING, OKAY?

43:00.667 --> 43:02.417
- LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA?
- YES?

43:02.417 --> 43:03.875
- JIM MCCOURT,
INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

43:03.875 --> 43:07.125
I WONDER IF I COULD HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?

43:07.125 --> 43:09.208
- OF COURSE.

43:14.083 --> 43:17.125
SO...WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

43:17.125 --> 43:19.417
- WELL, THIS IS REALLY
A COURTESY CALL.

43:19.417 --> 43:21.250
WE'RE ABOUT TO LAUNCH
A FORMAL INVESTIGATION

43:21.250 --> 43:25.000
INTO ONE OF YOUR DETECTIVES--
A...ANGEL BATISTA.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I UNDERSTAND
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.959
- YES.
YES, HE IS.

43:28.959 --> 43:31.083
- APPARENTLY, HE HAD
A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION

43:31.083 --> 43:32.542
WITH ONE OF HIS
FELLOW OFFICERS--

43:32.542 --> 43:34.125
A SERGEANT LOPEZ.

43:34.125 --> 43:37.417
- I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THE MATTER WAS SETTLED.

43:37.417 --> 43:38.792
- OH, FAR FROM IT.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.417
LOPEZ COLLAPSED
WHILE ON DUTY TODAY.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.375
HE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED
WITH INTERNAL BLEEDING.

43:43.375 --> 43:44.667
- MY GOD.

43:44.667 --> 43:46.750
- WE BELIEVE
THAT HE'LL PULL THROUGH,

43:46.750 --> 43:47.917
BUT HE'S FILED CHARGES.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.917
SOMETHING ELSE YOU
SHOULD BE AWARE OF:

43:50.917 --> 43:54.291
WE HAVE TWO EYEWITNESSES
WHO CLAIM THAT THEY SAW BATISTA

43:54.291 --> 43:56.333
KICK SERGEANT LOPEZ
WHILE ON THE GROUND.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.625
NOW, IF THAT IS TRUE,

43:57.625 --> 44:00.375
THAT IS ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON

44:00.375 --> 44:02.792
AND HE COULD NOT ONLY
LOSE HIS JOB...

44:02.792 --> 44:05.750
HE COULD SERVE TIME.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.542
- HAD TO BORROW THIS FROM YOU.

44:33.542 --> 44:36.250
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

44:36.250 --> 44:37.667
- WHAT THE HELL?

44:37.667 --> 44:40.500
- NORMALLY,
I BRING MY OWN PLASTIC,

44:40.500 --> 44:44.458
BUT...
I HAD TO...

44:44.458 --> 44:46.834
IMPROVISE.

44:46.834 --> 44:48.417
- [grunts]

44:48.417 --> 44:49.875
LET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.959
- I BET YOU'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE--

44:51.959 --> 44:55.125
"LET ME OUT OF HERE"--FROM
ALL THE WOMEN YOU'VE KILLED.

45:00.917 --> 45:05.750
I WISH YOU COULD SEE
THE ROOM I SET UP FOR YOU.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.834
BUT YOU FUCKED
EVERYTHING UP, BOYD.

45:14.041 --> 45:16.500
ALL THOSE PICTURES I TOOK

45:16.500 --> 45:17.792
OF THE WOMEN YOU KILLED.

45:17.792 --> 45:21.166
IT'S A SHAME YOU'LL NEVER
GET TO SEE THEM.

45:26.500 --> 45:31.375
I'LL JUST HAVE TO PAINT
A WORD-PICTURE FOR YOU INSTEAD.

45:31.375 --> 45:33.542
THEY WERE YOUNG.

45:33.542 --> 45:36.709
JUST STARTING THEIR LIVES.

45:36.709 --> 45:38.208
NOW THEY'RE FLOATING
IN FORMALDEHYDE

45:38.208 --> 45:42.041
AND STUFFED INTO BARRELS STREWN
AROUND A SWAMP.

45:42.041 --> 45:43.583
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

45:43.583 --> 45:46.500
- JUST A FELLOW TRAVELER

45:46.500 --> 45:48.875
WHO...

45:48.875 --> 45:51.333
ALSO LIKES TO PICK UP
DEAD ANIMALS.

45:51.333 --> 45:54.417
- I DID 'EM A FAVOR.

45:54.417 --> 45:56.583
THEY WERE ALL SUFFERING
AND I PUT 'EM

45:56.583 --> 45:59.750
OUT OF THEIR MISERY.

45:59.750 --> 46:03.875
- YEAH, YOU'LL BE DOING
ONE MORE FAVOR TONIGHT.

46:03.875 --> 46:07.166
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

46:07.166 --> 46:10.250
- I'VE RECENTLY SUFFERED
A LOSS.

46:10.250 --> 46:12.667
MY WIFE...

46:12.667 --> 46:16.250
WAS MURDERED
BY SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.542
SOMEONE LIKE ME.

46:18.542 --> 46:21.583
IT TURNED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN.

46:21.583 --> 46:23.625
- WHY IS IT MY PROBLEM?

46:23.625 --> 46:26.750
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE START
OF MY HEALING PROCESS.

46:26.750 --> 46:29.709
- I KNEW YOU WERE FUCKED UP

46:29.709 --> 46:32.750
THE MINUTE
I LAID EYES ON YOU.

46:32.750 --> 46:35.417
- I WAS FUCKED UP LONG
BEFORE THAT.

46:35.417 --> 46:37.333
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

46:37.333 --> 46:42.458
- REMEMBER IN THE TRUCK
YOU ASKED ME WHAT I WANT?

46:42.458 --> 46:48.166
I WANT MY WIFE BACK...

46:48.166 --> 46:50.458
BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO DO.

46:50.458 --> 46:52.291
- [grunts and coughs]

47:04.333 --> 47:06.166
- NO CHURCH BELLS.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.041
NO HALLELUJAH CHORUS.

47:08.041 --> 47:11.166
NOTHING FEELS DIFFERENT.

47:11.166 --> 47:13.709
IF ANYTHING, I'M EMPTIER.

47:13.709 --> 47:15.291
[scuffling]

47:34.542 --> 47:36.166
IT'S OKAY.

47:36.166 --> 47:40.709
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

47:40.709 --> 47:44.333
IT'S OKAY.
HERE.

47:44.333 --> 47:47.208
NO, DON'T.
DON'T.

47:47.208 --> 47:48.208
STOP.

47:48.208 --> 47:50.291
NO.

47:56.333 --> 47:58.375
SHE SAW EVERYTHING.

47:58.375 --> 48:01.083
- [groans]
