WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:12.611
This is where the dead roam.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.647
Really not good for kids here,
not good at all.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.250
We want to protect 'em.
It makes me feel terrible.

00:18.252 --> 00:21.754
Somebody's being
stabbed in the stomach.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.389
Are you having any kind
of health issues?

00:23.391 --> 00:25.157
The stabbing pains
in my back.

00:25.993 --> 00:29.395
The shadow people are
**** killing people here.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.897
This house is not a home.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.066
I just hear death.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.368
My name is Amy Allan.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.703
God.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.805
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:39.807 --> 00:40.973
I see dead people.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.174
Her face was all demonic.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.976
I speak to dead people...

00:43.978 --> 00:46.879
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:46.881 --> 00:48.280
...and they speak to me.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.249
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.951
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.853
Something happened.
Bam. Bam. Bam.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.021
I rely on my partner.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.556
I'm Steve DiShiavi.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.825
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.293
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:01.295 --> 01:04.897
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.799
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.601
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.970
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:11.972 --> 01:14.039
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:14.041 --> 01:15.307
...until the very end...

01:15.309 --> 01:16.909
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

01:16.911 --> 01:18.710
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:18.712 --> 01:20.879
That's it.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.781
...or time to get out.

01:22.783 --> 01:26.051
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:41.268 --> 01:43.135
I'm in
Spartanburg, South Carolina.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.971
It's about 80 miles west
of Charlotte.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.840
So I got a call
from a woman named Donna,

01:47.842 --> 01:49.641
who's a mother of three.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.244
Now she lives in a big,
beautiful, suburban house.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.147
Trouble is, she says the whole
family's being terrorized.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.884
But her special needs daughter
is getting the worst of it.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.552
She sounded really bad
on the phone

02:00.554 --> 02:01.854
and says if we can't help her,

02:01.856 --> 02:03.589
someone's gonna get
seriously hurt.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.698
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.700 --> 02:15.567
I clear the area
of any leading information,

02:15.569 --> 02:17.903
removing religious symbols,

02:17.905 --> 02:20.372
artwork,
and other personal items

02:20.374 --> 02:23.542
that could influence
her findings.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.544
When I'm done,

02:25.546 --> 02:28.347
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:41.362 --> 02:45.163
I'm having feelings
of very deep sadness

02:45.165 --> 02:48.600
and uncontrollable shaking
and fear.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.236
So much, pain and crying.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.606
Terrible, terrible.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.213
And I hear this house
is not a home.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.925
So, Donna, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:12.927 --> 03:14.826
you were obviously upset.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.695
What's goin' on?
- We moved here,

03:16.697 --> 03:19.565
and it's -- it's been
not what I dreamed about.

03:19.567 --> 03:24.670
We, all five of us,
sleep here in the living room.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.738
You're tellin' me the entire
family's sleepin' in this room?

03:26.740 --> 03:29.775
Right, 'cause no one wants
to sleep upstairs.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.910
We all feel better together.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.612
Give me an idea of what you guys
are goin' through.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.081
Well, we hear, um, footsteps.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.817
Um, we hear
unexplainable noises.

03:38.819 --> 03:43.388
Um, we see shadows everywhere,
apparitions, everything.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.223
Everything that you can
think of,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.426
it seems like we have seen
in every room.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.462
People are being scratched
and just feeling

03:50.464 --> 03:52.497
like they're being touched.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.366
How are you living
like this?

03:54.368 --> 03:56.602
It's very exhausting.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.770
And when we moved here,
I was perfectly healthy.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.740
And -- and now I'm just sick
all the time,

04:01.742 --> 04:04.042
kidney stones,
cervical cancer.

04:04.044 --> 04:09.214
It's gall bladder,
migraines, depression.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.717
It's one thing after another.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.152
I'm just ready for it to
be over any way it has to be.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.587
Whatever, it has to be done.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.055
Okay.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.562
I feel sick in here.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.565
I feel nauseous,
awful, terrible.

04:26.567 --> 04:30.135
I would think the living
would **** feel sick here.

04:30.137 --> 04:34.973
There'd be a lot of nausea,
anxiety, and anger.

04:37.177 --> 04:41.546
I see an angry man.

04:41.548 --> 04:44.349
He hurt people.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.784
He's scary.

04:48.355 --> 04:52.391
The living, they hear the guy.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.527
They hear walking,
up and down the stairs,

04:55.529 --> 04:56.762
all over the place.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.865
And I do feel like,
when they're sleeping,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.133
I feel like,

05:01.135 --> 05:04.436
he does inappropriate things
to the women,

05:04.438 --> 05:07.005
um, very inappropriate.

05:07.007 --> 05:10.042
Um, very, very inappropriate.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.177
I think he's the one
making people sick.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.945
I don't want to go upstairs.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.584
All right, so, Donna,

05:19.586 --> 05:21.119
who exactly lives in the house
with you?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.622
Well, this is my family.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.324
- Okay. Who's here?
- This is Tyler. He's 21.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.527
- Okay.
- Austin's 15.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.062
Abbie is 11.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.698
And that's me and my husband.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.200
Now you mentioned on the phone
Abbie has a condition.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.804
Right. She was diagnosed
with selective mutism.

05:38.806 --> 05:42.674
And it's basically, um,
an anxiety disorder.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.877
When she's asked anything
that actually bothers her,

05:45.879 --> 05:48.280
if it's any tension,

05:48.282 --> 05:51.883
um, she -- she shuts down
and she's not able to talk.

05:51.885 --> 05:55.353
Do you think it's caused
by what's goin' on in the house?

05:55.355 --> 05:58.090
Or do you think it's something
she was born with?

05:59.727 --> 06:02.360
It seems to me
that it may be the cause.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.562
And I think
there's things like,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.063
she doesn't want to ever
go in the bathroom.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.165
And I think
there is something more

06:07.167 --> 06:09.501
that she's not able
to tell me about.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.070
She'll stay in the bed,
she'll cover her head up,

06:12.072 --> 06:14.973
and she just will not talk
for a day.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.142
There's nothing to console her.
You can't do anything.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.677
And it just broke my heart.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.078
That's very concerning
for me

06:20.080 --> 06:22.047
because she may
be experiencing

06:22.049 --> 06:23.548
a hell of a lot more
than you know.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.151
Sometimes I worry that it takes
advantage of the fact

06:26.153 --> 06:28.520
that she can't tell me
everything.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.021
That's why we're just
praying that --

06:30.023 --> 06:32.257
that y'all can help us.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.829
Don't like it in here.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.531
I don't like this space at all.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.767
There's so much here.
My god.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.970
I'm -- I'm like, completely
overwhelmed right now.

06:44.972 --> 06:48.173
There's a teenager here
who's having problems,

06:48.175 --> 06:50.575
long hair, delicate, delicate.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.477
So I think it's a demon.

06:52.479 --> 06:55.647
And this demon is really messing
with the girl,

06:55.649 --> 06:58.850
acting like a woman,
crawling into the bed

06:58.852 --> 07:01.686
and...

07:01.688 --> 07:05.423
touching feeling, cuddling.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.492
It's evil.
It's so **** evil, though.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.628
It's so **** evil.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.002
All right, Donna,
why'd you bring me upstairs?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.270
What's the story?

07:18.272 --> 07:21.039
I was,
sleeping one night, woke up,

07:21.041 --> 07:24.242
and I couldn't breathe,
like I was being choked.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.610
And I couldn't move.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.014
And Abbie woke up and she kept
sayin', "Mom, mom, mom!"

07:29.016 --> 07:32.184
And it kinda upsets me
'cause she was so scared.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.519
And, um, she said my lips
were turnin' blue

07:34.521 --> 07:36.154
and my face was swelling.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.590
- You sure it wasn't a dream?
- Yes.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.292
Do you think whatever's here
wants you here?

07:40.294 --> 07:43.328
No, especially not up here.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.063
This is <i> their</i> place.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.398
And now whatever's here
forced you guys

07:46.400 --> 07:48.099
into not sleeping up here?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.968
Yeah.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.369
Okay. Anything else?

07:51.371 --> 07:54.105
Yeah. I see an apparition
of a-a man.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.373
It's all black.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.142
Um, he's --
he's very tall.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.344
The only thing I do see
that's not black is his --

07:59.346 --> 08:02.581
is a pale --
pale, yellow eyes.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.784
And he has a long, um,

08:05.786 --> 08:07.686
hairy, Grinch-like fingers.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.287
The way you describe,
it's something out of,

08:09.289 --> 08:10.422
like, a horror movie.

08:10.424 --> 08:13.058
It's kinda like his --
like an owl.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.559
I know it sounds crazy.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.595
Any medications
you're taking for the --

08:16.597 --> 08:19.231
the symptoms you're havin'?
- Mnh-mnh. No.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.466
Okay. The only reason I ask
is because I don't know

08:21.468 --> 08:22.734
if you're hallucinatin'
what you're seein' or...

08:22.736 --> 08:24.169
Right.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.437
I would think that, too.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.173
- 'Cause it's pretty bizarre.
- It is.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.841
All right.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.678
The demon went through the wall.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.816
And then it, like, morphed into,
like, a creepy face.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.484
Like, grotesque.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.653
Not only can this demon
project itself

08:41.655 --> 08:43.288
to look like anything it wants,

08:43.289 --> 08:47.225
it's also able to affect
the living in horrible ways.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.861
I can't breathe.
I feel, like, choking.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.197
I think the demon's
making people kill each other

08:52.199 --> 08:54.466
or kill themselves.

08:54.468 --> 08:57.469
This place is ****.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.037
Is anything else goin' on?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.338
Well, I hear, um, um,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.807
a female voice
calling my name.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.109
'Cause this always
usually happens

09:04.111 --> 09:05.877
when I'm at home by myself.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.612
And it --
it scares me to death.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.447
Are there any females
other than you in the house,

09:09.449 --> 09:10.515
other than Abbie?

09:10.517 --> 09:12.951
Mnh-mnh. No.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.686
TV on, anything like that?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.988
No, I had all the TVs
turned off.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.590
Well, you got
your hands full.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.459
They definitely
don't like us here.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.961
They don't want us here.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.829
I think
they just want us gone.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.135
There's a woman there,
and she's just staring at me.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.469
She scares me.

09:31.471 --> 09:36.174
She scares me
because she's <i> so</i> not okay.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.044
She's crawling on the floor.
She's crying.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.346
She's screaming. She's yelling.
She's in pain. She was hurt.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.448
I don't know what's
goin' on here.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.817
My god. I'm so scared.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.185
The dead have been
**** here.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.820
You know, it's not good.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.190
They can't move on.
It's really bad.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.726
I think the dead here
really do think they're in hell.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.130
It's so not good.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.219
So, Andy,
this is your master bedroom?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.721
- Correct.
- Okay.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.357
Well, this is the first house in
over 100 cases I've ever been in

10:25.359 --> 10:27.258
where the bedroom set wasn't
even set up.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.128
So what you're tellin' me is
that stuff was so bad up here

10:30.130 --> 10:31.629
that you guys
didn't even go as far

10:31.631 --> 10:33.732
as even putting the bed
together?
That's right.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.100
Now where -- where do you
specifically sleep?

10:35.102 --> 10:38.870
Downstairs, in the recliner.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.138
So, Andy, I was talkin'
to your wife,

10:40.140 --> 10:41.506
and she was tellin' me about

10:41.508 --> 10:43.508
everything she's going through,
plus the kids.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.510
It makes me feel terrible.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.846
You want to protect 'em.
You -- you want to be there.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.115
But, um, it just seemed like
ever since we've been

10:50.117 --> 10:53.818
in this house, it's just been
one issue after another.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.920
The kids don't like
to come upstairs.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.757
Now, Andy, have you had
any of the experiences

10:58.759 --> 11:00.492
that your wife
and the kids have had?

11:00.494 --> 11:02.027
Well, there's a few things
that's happened.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.828
I've heard noises,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.998
like, maybe something
falling off of a counter.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.400
Then I go and check on it,

11:08.402 --> 11:11.102
and, you know, don't --
don't see anything.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.439
So I just kinda discount it.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.774
Anything else happen?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.675
Severe room temperature
changes.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.644
The hallway will be
one temperature.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.913
You come into this room,
it's like a meat locker.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.748
What time of the year
were you feeling this?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.350
Well, it was during
the summer.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.119
Did you shut off the vents
or anything in this room?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.522
No, they hadn't been.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.991
That's strange.
Anything else?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.592
Since we started remodelin',

11:34.594 --> 11:37.195
I started, you know,
havin' trouble breathin'

11:37.197 --> 11:39.297
and my back started hurtin'
really bad.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.167
And then I had kind of
a tightness of the chest.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.169
Now have you felt that
any place else in the house?

11:44.171 --> 11:45.336
No, I haven't.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.072
- What about at work?
- No.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.673
It hasn't happened
to you since?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.642
- No, hasn't.
- That's kinda strange.

11:50.644 --> 11:53.678
I believe something
attacked me.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.750
You're kinda ****
anywhere in this house.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.888
This is just
where it's most active.

12:03.890 --> 12:08.460
I think that area's
like a portal.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.762
- What does that mean?
- It's a doorway.

12:10.764 --> 12:14.332
It's for dead people,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.635
connects outside.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.105
Other houses are affected.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.173
Something's happening
in my stomach.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.218
So, Tyler,
I was talkin' to Mom.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.453
She said you basically
grew up here, correct?

12:35.455 --> 12:36.621
Right. Yes, sir.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.022
- How old are you now?
-21.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.559
Now what about yourself
as far as experiences go?

12:41.561 --> 12:45.396
Feeling, you know,
drained all the time.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.532
Sleeping for 12 hours

12:47.534 --> 12:50.735
and feeling like I've only
gotten two. So...

12:50.737 --> 12:53.805
Your father mentioned
chest pains and back pains

12:53.807 --> 12:55.206
and stuff like that.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.575
Are you having any kind
of health issues?

12:57.577 --> 13:00.011
The stabbing pains in my back.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.847
I'll -- I'll be in the bed
and I won't be able to,

13:02.849 --> 13:05.250
for about 5 minutes,
be able to get up.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.518
It just hurts.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.888
One second I'm fine,
and then the next,

13:09.890 --> 13:11.156
extreme pain.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.224
I did over six tests,

13:13.226 --> 13:17.695
and they said they had no idea
what would be causin' the pain.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.197
What do you think
is goin' on here?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.099
You think it's paranormal
that's causing your issues?

13:21.101 --> 13:25.236
Without a doubt. I've seen
too many things not to.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.538
All right. Anything else?

13:26.540 --> 13:29.641
The one night I was laying
on Abbie's bed,

13:29.643 --> 13:34.579
I saw a black shadow figure
block out the TV.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.917
It was like a real tall,
stocky man, had yellow eyes.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.985
And then how long does
he hang out?

13:40.987 --> 13:45.823
Three, for seconds, looks at me,
and then disappears.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.392
To this day, it haunts me.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.695
All right. So that's in Abbie's
room where you saw this.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.330
I mean, you gotta be scared

13:52.332 --> 13:54.532
that she may be seeing
the same damn thing.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.502
And you know,
it -- it upsets me

13:57.504 --> 14:00.872
because for something
to go after her...

14:00.874 --> 14:03.474
you know, any --
any time I would say,

14:03.476 --> 14:07.145
"Come after me.
You know, don't go after her."

14:07.147 --> 14:10.582
I'd take her place any day.

14:10.584 --> 14:13.851
If you had a choice of living
here or not, what would you do?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.154
I'd go as far away
from this place as I could.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.526
I don't like it here.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.262
This is a bad room.
This is a very, very bad room.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.799
I'm seein', um...

14:30.237 --> 14:32.103
They're in the walls.
They're in the walls.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.272
And they're hidin'
in the **** walls.

14:34.274 --> 14:38.076
And they are...bad.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.880
People see these.
- Like, how many?

14:42.882 --> 14:46.251
There was probably, like, five.

14:46.253 --> 14:51.823
They are slitherin' around
on the walls.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.658
They're physical.
They're physical.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.093
Um --

14:55.095 --> 14:58.363
Mother ****, mother.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.810
So the property records
on this place

15:12.812 --> 15:15.212
go all the way back
to the mid-1700s.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.680
In fact, the first family

15:16.682 --> 15:19.116
who settled on
Donna and Andy's property

15:19.118 --> 15:22.252
got the land grant
from King George III of England.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.254
Amazingly, I managed
to track down a descendant

15:24.256 --> 15:25.956
who still lives in the area,

15:25.958 --> 15:27.391
and he says he's got a story

15:27.393 --> 15:28.792
that will definitely
help my case.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.467
So, Caroll, I understand
that you are the descendant

15:36.469 --> 15:38.669
of the original owners
of my clients' property.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.871
Yes. I'm the --
the fourth great grandson

15:40.873 --> 15:42.773
of John Caldwell,
who's buried here.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.509
This -- this is
his original marker.

15:45.511 --> 15:46.844
So from what I understand,
you told me

15:46.846 --> 15:48.846
he was granted the land
from the king?

15:48.848 --> 15:53.784
Yes. He was granted
250 acres in 1772.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.552
So my clients' house
is on the original property.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.787
That's correct, yes.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.921
Now you had mentioned to me

15:57.923 --> 15:59.490
that there was
a pretty interesting story

15:59.492 --> 16:00.724
in regards to your family.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.292
Yeah, John Caldwell,

16:02.294 --> 16:04.428
he eventually ended up
fighting on the side

16:04.430 --> 16:06.563
of the American Revolution.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.399
There was a person
in this area

16:08.401 --> 16:10.534
who was on the side
of the British.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.570
And he was called
"Bloody Bill" Cunningham.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.639
He was a terror
in this part of the country.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.275
He killed many people,
in this area

16:18.277 --> 16:20.511
who were loyal
to the colonists.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.547
In November 1780,
Bloody Bill Cunningham

16:23.549 --> 16:26.316
captured
John Caldwell's younger son,

16:26.318 --> 16:29.052
who was 14 at the time,
hacked him with swords,

16:29.054 --> 16:31.789
scalped him, and left him lyin'
on the side of the road.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.624
That's a brutal way to go.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.593
He lingered till morning and --
and passed the next morning.

16:36.595 --> 16:40.330
And he is the first person
buried here in this cemetery.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.371
I'm seein' an older man.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.773
He's taking a boy, I think.

16:49.775 --> 16:53.444
He's pushin' his face
to the floor,

16:53.446 --> 16:55.212
kickin' him.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.114
"This isn't how you act!"

16:57.116 --> 16:59.283
Kickin' him.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.085
This is residual.

17:02.087 --> 17:06.423
The teenage boy's
in trouble.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.660
He's, like,
maybe 15, 16 years old.

17:09.662 --> 17:13.464
So much anger
between these two people,

17:13.465 --> 17:16.599
between the kid
and the -- the adult,

17:16.602 --> 17:18.769
so much **** anger.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.171
I know that
that man was influenced.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.606
What's doing that?

17:22.608 --> 17:24.241
The demon.

17:27.813 --> 17:30.214
Something's wrong.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.350
Feel like somebody's
being stabbed in the stomach.

17:33.352 --> 17:37.588
I feel like a young male
is being stabbed in the stomach.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.494
I gotta know more
about this Bloody Bill guy.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.162
I'm on my way
to meet a genealogist

17:45.164 --> 17:47.431
who says not only
did he terrorize the city,

17:47.433 --> 17:49.500
but he ended up
killing someone else

17:49.502 --> 17:50.968
who lived
on my client's property.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.677
So, Suzanne, this guy,
Bloody Bill Cunningham,

18:00.679 --> 18:02.279
I understand he was
a bit of a psycho

18:02.281 --> 18:03.514
that killed a lot of people.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.415
- That's true.
- What do you know about him?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.184
He was born
in South Carolina,

18:07.186 --> 18:08.552
and he grew up in a family

18:08.554 --> 18:10.988
that was loyal
to the British crown.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.123
And this is a portrait
of Bloody Bill.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.095
Looks pretty regal
in this photo, doesn't he?

18:18.097 --> 18:21.265
So how's this guy
turn into a bloody killer?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.800
At the age of 19,
he decides

18:23.802 --> 18:27.604
to go against his parents'
loyalty to the crown

18:27.606 --> 18:30.974
and join with
the American colonists to fight,

18:30.976 --> 18:34.478
with the one proviso
that he not be required

18:34.480 --> 18:36.947
to kill or go after
his family.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.348
Okay.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.552
Well, a few months after going
with the American colonists,

18:41.554 --> 18:44.087
he's asked to do
just exactly that.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.390
He's asked to go after
his family.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.391
Okay. So what does he do?

18:47.393 --> 18:49.993
He refuses. He resigns.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.229
And his commanding officer
and some others

18:52.231 --> 18:55.198
went looking for him 'cause they
weren't happy with the decision.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.769
And they found his parents
and his younger brother.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.771
They roughed up his parents

19:00.773 --> 19:02.839
and whipped his brother
to death.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.441
Wow. Okay.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.209
So now I can see where this
guy's anger's startin' to build.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.313
Yes. He gets together
a group of men,

19:09.315 --> 19:12.416
and he starts out
on a rampage to get even.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.252
They traveled through
the countryside burning homes,

19:15.254 --> 19:18.255
killing people, looting.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.724
- So how bad was it?
- He killed at least 50 people,

19:20.726 --> 19:22.659
including
John Caldwell Junior,

19:22.661 --> 19:24.294
who lived on
your clients' property.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.997
I just left his grave site.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.000
All right, so at some point,
this Bloody Bill gets stopped?

19:30.002 --> 19:33.403
In 1782, he was banished
from South Carolina

19:33.405 --> 19:36.106
and fled to Nassau
in the Bahamas.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.475
- What happens to him there?
- He died there,

19:38.477 --> 19:41.778
about the age of 31,
in 1787.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.347
Any cause of death?
Do we have any idea?

19:43.349 --> 19:46.450
Some suggest
that he died of T.B.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.485
- Good. He deserved it.
- Yes.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.823
Do you have any idea

19:52.825 --> 19:54.925
how long these shadow people
have been here?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.227
I would just say forever.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.196
And this demon thing?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.231
Forever.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.066
Do you have an idea
what they want?

20:03.068 --> 20:05.702
The shadow people are
**** killing people here.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.104
And I think the demon's

20:07.106 --> 20:09.606
**** makin' people kill
each other or kill themselves,

20:09.608 --> 20:11.341
****, you know?

20:16.482 --> 20:18.482
This is bad land.
It's bad.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.083
It's not good.

20:20.085 --> 20:23.253
This, activity

20:23.255 --> 20:26.156
does go, pretty far back.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.692
It goes this way
and it goes this way.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.895
And other houses
are being affected.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.097
This is where the dead roam.

20:34.099 --> 20:37.434
Everybody's wanderin' around.
Everybody's wandering.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.336
It's like chaos.
It's not good.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.605
Dead people feel
like they're in hell.

20:48.213 --> 20:49.413
If you need us to investigate

20:49.415 --> 20:51.314
unexplained activity
in your home,

20:51.316 --> 20:54.384
go to the "The Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.253
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.454
And we'll help if we can.

21:04.872 --> 21:08.039
So far, I've got clients
being physically assaulted

21:08.041 --> 21:09.508
on a property
where Bloody Bill murdered

21:09.510 --> 21:13.778
one of his 50 victims,
the child of a former owner.

21:13.780 --> 21:17.015
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

21:17.017 --> 21:20.919
Searching through old records,
I find two mysterious drownings.

21:20.921 --> 21:22.487
Turns out,
they happened in a quarry

21:22.489 --> 21:26.691
right on my clients'
original property line.

21:26.693 --> 21:28.627
I'm heading over to meet
the sheriff of Spartanburg,

21:28.629 --> 21:30.896
who's gonna tell me
exactly what happened.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.405
So, Sheriff, I came across
those two drownings

21:40.407 --> 21:43.174
in my research
that happened in the quarry,

21:43.176 --> 21:45.877
a little over a mile from
my, clients' property.

21:45.879 --> 21:48.079
So what can you tell me
about the first victim?

21:48.081 --> 21:50.215
Mr. Henry Oglesby

21:50.217 --> 21:52.717
was a 14-year-old male
in good shape.

21:52.719 --> 21:55.387
He ran track.
He was healthy and athletic.

21:55.389 --> 21:58.023
This is a photo here
of Henry Oglesby

21:58.025 --> 22:00.492
at -- at the age of 14.

22:00.494 --> 22:04.062
He was at the rock quarry
and decided to go swimmin'.

22:04.064 --> 22:05.964
This was
a very popular hang out.

22:05.966 --> 22:07.799
He jumped in the water.

22:07.801 --> 22:10.135
And I don't know
what height he jumped from.

22:10.137 --> 22:11.803
He never resurfaced.

22:11.805 --> 22:14.306
I can't imagine the heartbreak
his parents felt

22:14.308 --> 22:16.441
losing
a 14-year-old like that.

22:16.443 --> 22:19.077
All right, so what do we know
about the other drowning?

22:19.079 --> 22:22.113
Yeah, August the 6th of '89,
almost 2 years.

22:22.115 --> 22:24.316
A David Wayne Ellison,
25 years old.

22:24.318 --> 22:27.552
Same -- same deal, ha--
hanging out with his buddies.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.021
Two guys jumped in,
one came out.

22:30.023 --> 22:33.992
And we find him
in about 17 feet of water.

22:33.994 --> 22:35.393
So now you got

22:35.395 --> 22:39.331
two pretty able-bodied,
strong guys drowning?

22:39.333 --> 22:40.665
Right.

22:40.667 --> 22:43.234
Okay.

22:43.236 --> 22:47.105
I'm hearing, like,
"Don't go in the pool."

22:47.107 --> 22:54.512
And I saw a shadow person
go in the **** pool.

22:54.514 --> 22:57.749
"Ya think it's safe over here,
but it's not."

22:57.751 --> 23:00.518
What do you think would happen
if people go in the pool?

23:00.520 --> 23:04.356
I think that,
they might drown.

23:04.358 --> 23:05.924
I think that the shadow person

23:05.926 --> 23:07.692
that hangs out
in the **** pool

23:07.694 --> 23:08.960
would try to drown people.

23:08.962 --> 23:12.063
- Like how?
- It'd pull their feet.

23:12.065 --> 23:15.133
Not safe, not safe,
especially kids,

23:15.135 --> 23:16.801
really dangerous here
for children.

23:16.803 --> 23:20.071
Really not good for kids here,
not good at all.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.008
I come across another case

23:23.010 --> 23:25.343
that you might find interesting
near your clients property.

23:25.345 --> 23:27.212
There was a murder
that took place there

23:27.214 --> 23:29.914
on October the 31st, 1990.

23:29.916 --> 23:32.350
- At the quarry?
- Yes, sir.

23:32.352 --> 23:33.718
Okay,
so what exactly happened?

23:33.720 --> 23:36.955
It's a gentleman by the name
of Ramone Hernandez.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.190
Mr. Hernandez is
24 years old.

23:39.192 --> 23:43.395
This next slide is, photos
of the two convicted killers.

23:43.397 --> 23:45.330
This gentleman here
on the left is --

23:45.332 --> 23:47.599
his name is
Charles Steven Sink.

23:47.601 --> 23:49.200
And his girlfriend,
Ellen Holcolm,

23:49.202 --> 23:52.303
who have both been convicted
of murdering Mr. Hernandez.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.873
Okay. He's got a smirk
on his face.

23:54.875 --> 23:57.242
All right, so how did
the murder go down?

23:57.244 --> 24:00.078
Hernandez, gentleman who was
suffering from a brain tumor

24:00.080 --> 24:02.347
and had a very small amount
of time to live,

24:02.349 --> 24:05.250
he had a settlement, a large sum
of money in his pocket.

24:05.252 --> 24:08.453
And, these two took him out
under the disguise

24:08.455 --> 24:11.823
that they were gonna go party
and have some fun.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.359
This Sink guy had
a- a cocaine problem.

24:14.361 --> 24:15.794
You know, he's needin' money.

24:15.796 --> 24:17.862
And he hits Hernandez
in the back of the head...

24:17.864 --> 24:19.931
- Right.
- With -- with the back of an ax.

24:19.933 --> 24:22.033
So not to really cut him up.

24:22.035 --> 24:24.235
And they tried
to cover their actions

24:24.237 --> 24:25.303
by throwing him into
the quarry

24:25.305 --> 24:28.006
and make it look like
a drowning.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.941
He and her both had planned this

24:29.943 --> 24:31.843
to make it look like
an accident.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.245
All right, so how much money
did these two get?

24:34.247 --> 24:37.615
We know $700
that they took off this man.

24:37.617 --> 24:39.417
All right, so this homicide
happened over 25 years ago.

24:39.419 --> 24:40.652
Are these guys still in?

24:40.654 --> 24:42.921
- Sink got out in 2013.
- Okay.

24:42.923 --> 24:46.591
And, she got -- she got in
or around the same time,

24:46.593 --> 24:49.694
but has, reviolated
and gone back.

24:49.696 --> 24:52.897
Wow, so I got a murder
that pretty much took place

24:52.899 --> 24:54.499
and the body dumped
in that same quarry

24:54.501 --> 24:56.167
where these two kids drowned.
- That's right.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.573
There's a man.

25:01.575 --> 25:05.677
I get he's young,
probably late teens.

25:05.679 --> 25:08.446
I feel like someone
is after him.

25:08.448 --> 25:11.015
He's getting beat up.
He's being beaten.

25:13.353 --> 25:17.288
I see two people around him,
one is a tall, chubby man.

25:17.290 --> 25:19.824
I get the name Steve.

25:19.826 --> 25:21.092
This dude

25:21.094 --> 25:24.129
who's hurting this kid
is in his 30s or 40s.

25:24.131 --> 25:27.065
So this is recent, 1990s.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.468
It's dark. It's dark where
they are, no lights.

25:30.470 --> 25:33.671
He is crying and praying
and begging for his life.

25:33.673 --> 25:37.509
And I hear him yelling,
"Not here! Not like this!"

25:43.750 --> 25:46.117
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk,

25:46.119 --> 25:48.553
but the demon projecting
itself is an old woman

25:48.555 --> 25:52.090
to a living child
had me the most concerned.

25:52.092 --> 25:56.594
This negative,
evil thing is coming up.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.931
And it's wrapping itself
around her,

25:59.933 --> 26:04.569
acting like it's good,
but it's really evil.

26:04.571 --> 26:07.438
Next, I described how the demon
showed itself to me.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.108
It was very disfigured.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.076
And it was reaching out.

26:12.078 --> 26:16.414
And it had these long,
dagger-like teeth.

26:18.585 --> 26:20.318
Is this what you saw?

26:22.122 --> 26:24.022
Yes.

26:43.594 --> 26:46.494
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:46.496 --> 26:47.796
we're ready
to reveal our findings

26:47.798 --> 26:51.333
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

26:51.335 --> 26:53.468
So, Amy, this may look
like a living room,

26:53.470 --> 26:55.870
but we're actually doing
the reveal right in the middle

26:55.872 --> 26:58.340
where everyone
in this house sleeps.

26:58.342 --> 26:59.841
It's that bad.

26:59.843 --> 27:02.777
This is Andy, his wife, Donna,

27:02.779 --> 27:05.313
her son, Tyler.

27:05.315 --> 27:09.084
Also...

27:09.086 --> 27:12.053
they have a son, Austin,
who's 15,

27:12.055 --> 27:15.457
and their daughter, Abbie,
who's 11.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.525
Now Abbie's the reason
we've been called in.

27:17.527 --> 27:20.629
Donna believes whatever's here
is picking on her

27:20.631 --> 27:23.164
and she's afraid Abbie
could be in danger.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.466
Now that Amy knows a little bit

27:24.468 --> 27:26.067
about who you guys are
and the rest of the family,

27:26.069 --> 27:28.203
I'm gonna ask her to describe
her walk for us.

27:31.308 --> 27:35.043
One of the first things that
came through very, very clearly

27:35.045 --> 27:39.414
was a disturbing residual scene
I saw involving a young male.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.750
I got that he was
in his late teens.

27:41.752 --> 27:43.885
He was extremely frightened.

27:43.887 --> 27:46.688
He felt like he was
going to die.

27:46.690 --> 27:48.657
Somebody was after him.

27:48.659 --> 27:50.492
It was dark out
at this time.

27:50.494 --> 27:53.662
He was crying and praying

27:53.664 --> 27:55.997
and begging for his life.

27:55.999 --> 27:59.334
He was saying, you know,
"Not here! Not like this!"

27:59.336 --> 28:03.772
He was being beaten,
by two individuals.

28:03.774 --> 28:07.976
And the one that I really,
got a look at was tall.

28:07.978 --> 28:09.611
He was chubby.

28:09.613 --> 28:12.013
I did get the name "Steve"
with him.

28:12.015 --> 28:14.649
And I got that this was
a fairly recent attack,

28:14.651 --> 28:17.886
possibly 1990s.

28:19.923 --> 28:22.524
That sounds a lot like
some, case

28:22.526 --> 28:24.459
I came across on my research.

28:24.461 --> 28:27.328
A mile from here, you guys have
a rock quarry, um,

28:27.330 --> 28:29.998
that used to be part
of the original property.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.100
Back on Halloween night, 1990,

28:32.102 --> 28:35.303
a young guy named
Ramone Hernandez was down here

28:35.305 --> 28:36.938
with two of his friends --

28:36.940 --> 28:42.444
Charles Steven Sink,
who I happen to have a photo of,

28:42.446 --> 28:44.879
middle name Steven...

28:47.017 --> 28:50.652
...and his girlfriend,
Evelyn Holcolm.

28:50.654 --> 28:55.056
Now Ramone had terminal cancer,

28:55.058 --> 28:56.691
recently cashed
a disability check

28:56.693 --> 28:58.493
and had a lot of money on him.

28:58.495 --> 29:01.162
His so-called friends
took him to the quarry

29:01.164 --> 29:02.997
and suddenly attacked him.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.733
They knocked him unconscious.

29:04.735 --> 29:09.037
And Holcolm and Sink pushed him
into the quarry.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.172
- Why'd they do it?
- For the money.

29:11.174 --> 29:13.541
Ramone has $700 in cash on him.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.477
Cops wind up figuring it out.

29:15.479 --> 29:16.611
They got a hold of these two,

29:16.613 --> 29:18.480
and they wind up confessing
to it.

29:18.482 --> 29:20.949
Sink spent 23 years in prison
and he got out.

29:20.951 --> 29:22.050
He's out now. He's alive.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.686
Now Holcolm got out
after a few years,

29:24.688 --> 29:26.654
but is back in jail
for another offense.

29:26.656 --> 29:28.356
Do you think that's what
you might have been seein'?

29:28.358 --> 29:30.725
Well,
it sounds just like it.

29:34.798 --> 29:40.168
The next thing was that I...
came into the house

29:40.170 --> 29:42.771
and I saw this male.

29:42.773 --> 29:45.173
He seemed extremely angry.

29:45.175 --> 29:48.009
He was hurting people
in his life.

29:48.011 --> 29:50.411
One of the things
I thought was

29:50.413 --> 29:55.283
that you might
hear him walking around.

29:55.285 --> 29:57.485
Everybody in the house
hears footsteps, correct?

29:57.487 --> 29:59.154
Yes.

29:59.156 --> 30:01.189
I hear footsteps
going up and down,

30:01.191 --> 30:02.490
up and down, up and down.

30:02.492 --> 30:04.025
That's him.

30:06.830 --> 30:12.934
I got that he would
occasionally touch women,

30:12.936 --> 30:15.537
possibly,
inappropriately.

30:15.539 --> 30:19.007
I also got that he spends
a lot of time right here.

30:19.009 --> 30:23.444
So in this room,
you may feel nausea and anxiety.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.846
A lot of what you're sayin'
is what these guys

30:24.848 --> 30:26.581
are experiencing.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.616
Explain your health issues
to Amy.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.352
There's lots
of different health issues,

30:31.354 --> 30:34.889
kidneys and gall bladder,
back,

30:34.891 --> 30:37.725
and just tired all the time.

30:37.727 --> 30:39.227
Since we've moved here,
I've di--

30:39.229 --> 30:41.229
been diagnosed
with a heart condition.

30:41.231 --> 30:44.566
I've had stabbing pains

30:44.568 --> 30:47.969
and back pain all the time.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.538
Now this might explain
why we were called in.

30:50.540 --> 30:52.207
Abbie has developed

30:52.209 --> 30:55.643
an anxiety disorder
called selective mutism.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.613
Any time she's feeling
threatened or anxious,

30:58.615 --> 31:02.717
she's not able to tell me 'cause
she just -- she shuts down.

31:02.719 --> 31:05.320
Interesting. Okay.

31:05.322 --> 31:09.757
Typically,
on a normal investigation,

31:09.759 --> 31:13.528
I will come across,
you know, one thing

31:13.530 --> 31:16.598
that is of major importance
at a location.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.967
You, in fact,
have several.

31:22.339 --> 31:26.641
I actually came across
a portal.

31:26.643 --> 31:28.977
It's upstairs
at the end of the hall

31:28.979 --> 31:31.079
before you go into
the big room.

31:31.081 --> 31:35.416
And what this is,
is a doorway for the dead.

31:35.418 --> 31:37.151
The dead that were coming
through this

31:37.153 --> 31:38.319
were indicating to me that

31:38.321 --> 31:40.054
they literally feel like
they're stuck

31:40.056 --> 31:41.456
and that they're stuck
in hell.

31:44.728 --> 31:45.894
So let me get this straight

31:45.896 --> 31:47.095
So there's a portal here,

31:47.097 --> 31:49.230
the dead could come
from just about anywhere?

31:49.232 --> 31:51.199
Yeah.

31:51.201 --> 31:55.370
And there are a lot of people
that are coming through.

31:56.606 --> 31:58.072
I'm sorry...

31:59.309 --> 32:03.111
All these horrible things
that happened around this area,

32:03.113 --> 32:04.679
that were negative,

32:04.681 --> 32:08.549
are being sucked in here.

32:08.551 --> 32:09.884
It tears me up.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.887
I wished it was me
that was experiencing

32:12.889 --> 32:14.889
as opposed to them.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.228
The other thing
that's coming in

32:20.230 --> 32:23.865
with all of these lost,
dead people roaming about

32:23.867 --> 32:26.601
was upstairs in the hallway.

32:26.603 --> 32:30.672
And it was shadow people.

32:30.674 --> 32:34.943
And they were slithering
flat on the walls,

32:34.945 --> 32:38.079
up and down
and on the ceiling.

32:38.081 --> 32:41.282
These things have been here
for a very, very long time

32:41.284 --> 32:43.985
and have somehow
figured out a way

32:43.987 --> 32:48.756
to cross over from
possibly another dimension.

32:52.028 --> 32:55.363
They are extremely dangerous.

32:55.365 --> 32:59.100
They tend to center
their anger

32:59.102 --> 33:02.236
around children,
the elderly,

33:02.238 --> 33:05.740
and individuals
who are sick.

33:05.742 --> 33:10.111
Now Tyler here, tell Amy
about the shadow figure you see.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.513
It feels like
it's about 7 foot tall.

33:12.515 --> 33:14.983
- Okay.
- And it's peering down on me.

33:14.985 --> 33:16.751
And it has yellow eyes.

33:16.753 --> 33:18.786
Really. Okay.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.723
I see something,
like he says, very tall

33:21.725 --> 33:23.791
with pale, yellow eyes.

33:23.793 --> 33:27.228
And he's got these long,
creepy fingers.

33:27.230 --> 33:30.398
It makes me think
that I'm goin' crazy.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.166
Now Abbie sees them also,
right, Donna?

33:32.168 --> 33:34.535
Right. That's something
that shuts her down.

33:34.537 --> 33:35.803
It scares her.

33:35.805 --> 33:40.641
If she's seen half the things
I've seen, then...

33:40.643 --> 33:42.643
I can't imagine.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.779
All right, so what do
these shadow figures want?

33:44.781 --> 33:46.814
They want to abduct
or they want to kill.

33:50.453 --> 33:52.020
I don't want you guys
goin' in the pool,

33:52.022 --> 33:55.390
especially the kids,
because when I was outside,

33:55.392 --> 33:58.092
I was seein' this shadow person
goin' into the pool.

33:58.094 --> 34:00.428
And I saw that thing,

34:00.430 --> 34:02.697
like, people swimming
and then yanking them down

34:02.699 --> 34:07.435
by their feet
and tryin' to drown 'em.

34:07.437 --> 34:11.606
Now this house sits on
what used to be a 250-acre farm.

34:11.608 --> 34:13.440
And in the middle of that farm
was that huge quarry

34:13.443 --> 34:15.009
where the murder took place.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.610
The other thing I found out
about the quarry

34:16.612 --> 34:17.945
is that two young people

34:17.947 --> 34:22.315
drowned there under
very mysterious circumstances.

34:22.318 --> 34:24.752
First kid was
on August 22nd, 1987.

34:24.754 --> 34:28.389
A 14-year-old boy
by the name of Henry Oglesby

34:28.391 --> 34:31.525
went swimming there
with some friends.

34:31.527 --> 34:34.762
And I got a picture of Henry
right here.

34:34.764 --> 34:36.364
He jumped into about 10 feet
of water

34:36.366 --> 34:39.132
and he never came back up.

34:39.135 --> 34:41.034
Almost 2 years later, in 1989,

34:41.036 --> 34:44.272
a 25-year-old by the name
of David Wayne Ellison

34:44.274 --> 34:46.206
did the same exact thing.

34:46.208 --> 34:49.677
He went swimming, jumped in,
and never resurfaced.

34:49.679 --> 34:53.246
These were
two healthy young men.

34:53.248 --> 34:55.817
Now you said these shadow people
are all over the damn place.

34:55.819 --> 34:59.120
Yes.
Is it possible they could have
caused these kids to drown?

34:59.122 --> 35:02.557
I think so.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.825
There's actually been cases

35:03.827 --> 35:05.726
where individuals
have seen shadow people

35:05.728 --> 35:09.831
and then have had things
like heart attacks.

35:09.833 --> 35:11.466
The feeling of lethargy

35:11.468 --> 35:15.903
because they will literally
suck the breath out of you.

35:15.905 --> 35:19.540
Now that I hear it,
it's all fitting together.

35:19.542 --> 35:22.977
I've had more
breathing problems, you know,

35:22.979 --> 35:24.212
um, like that.

35:24.214 --> 35:26.814
So, I mean, it -- it's just...

35:26.816 --> 35:28.416
it's concerning.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.451
Now, Amy, Andy might
be downplaying things,

35:30.453 --> 35:34.222
but he was doing renovations
and got seriously sick.

35:34.224 --> 35:37.458
It's bad. I think he was
attacked up there.

35:37.460 --> 35:41.229
And he hurt for over a week.
He likes to play it down.

35:41.231 --> 35:42.630
Now do you think that's from
the shadow people?

35:42.632 --> 35:43.798
Or is that somethin' else?

35:43.800 --> 35:46.567
That's more than likely
the shadow people.

35:46.569 --> 35:47.935
Like, slowly,
they're draining,

35:47.937 --> 35:51.439
literally taking the life
from you.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.907
We're being held captive.

35:52.909 --> 35:54.542
Yeah.

35:58.515 --> 36:03.651
The biggest threat in your house
is a demonic presence.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.721
It's very powerful.

36:06.723 --> 36:08.222
One of the individuals
that I got

36:08.224 --> 36:12.226
that it's influencing
was in the pink room.

36:12.228 --> 36:13.561
That's Abbie's room.

36:13.563 --> 36:16.564
I got that there was
a lot of issues

36:16.566 --> 36:19.033
with the person in that room.

36:19.035 --> 36:22.303
And that this thing
is really essentially

36:22.305 --> 36:23.771
at the root of that problem.

36:23.773 --> 36:25.973
And all those fears
and traumas

36:25.975 --> 36:30.211
that are taking place
are being created by this thing.

36:30.213 --> 36:32.046
It can change forms.

36:32.048 --> 36:34.182
There's a lot of trickery
and faces it can take.

36:34.184 --> 36:37.318
Where's it at? I mean, is it
here with us, in the house?

36:37.320 --> 36:41.155
Or is it...
- Yes, it is.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.824
I feel -- I had a feelin'
that it was.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.726
So I'm not crazy.

36:45.728 --> 36:47.228
No.

36:47.230 --> 36:50.198
One of the sketches
that I had done was

36:50.200 --> 36:55.136
of a moment when it was
tricking the living person

36:55.138 --> 36:59.073
into thinking it was
a deceased relative.

37:08.318 --> 37:10.051
Jeez.

37:18.628 --> 37:21.362
It looks just like Abbie.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.197
It makes me so mad.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.832
I should've
done somethin' sooner.

37:27.203 --> 37:30.538
I'm worried.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.941
So now this is not how the demon
looked when you saw it, right?

37:33.943 --> 37:36.010
So what did it look like
when you saw it?

37:36.012 --> 37:38.145
I had a sketch done.

37:38.147 --> 37:39.847
Another one? Okay.

37:43.653 --> 37:45.519
God.
Well, this would scare
the **** out of me,

37:45.521 --> 37:47.255
I'll tell ya that.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.829
That's my -- that's my room.

37:57.333 --> 37:58.833
At night, I saw the --

37:58.835 --> 38:02.169
I saw it completely black out
the TV in my room.

38:02.171 --> 38:04.472
It was him lookin' down at me.

38:04.474 --> 38:07.275
It scared me to death. It took
the color out of my skin.

38:07.277 --> 38:10.478
And till this day,
I- I don't forget it.

38:10.480 --> 38:14.215
So, Donna, is this
the yellow-eyed thing you saw?

38:14.217 --> 38:16.550
Yeah.

38:16.552 --> 38:18.019
All right, so what does
this thing want?

38:18.021 --> 38:21.555
I feel like, the, demon

38:21.557 --> 38:24.525
has really attached itself
to Abbie.

38:26.629 --> 38:28.129
And I think it's already

38:28.131 --> 38:31.732
influencing her
to become depressed,

38:31.734 --> 38:34.635
um, possibly harm herself.

38:34.637 --> 38:38.973
And you guys aren't the first
to be influenced by this thing.

38:38.975 --> 38:41.676
That sucker's <i> old.</i>

38:41.678 --> 38:43.244
It upsets me, makes me mad

38:43.246 --> 38:45.846
that something could
have that power, you know,

38:45.848 --> 38:47.848
to do that.

38:47.850 --> 38:51.252
That fits right in with what
they do -- self-harm,

38:51.254 --> 38:54.288
harm to others,
divide and conquer.

38:54.290 --> 38:58.059
It makes me just want
to put the family in the car

38:58.061 --> 38:59.360
and not come back.

39:20.267 --> 39:22.367
Now every once in a while,
a client has a portal,

39:22.369 --> 39:23.668
and that's bad news.

39:23.670 --> 39:26.237
Shadow people come up even less,

39:26.239 --> 39:28.573
and that's usually
really bad news.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.141
This is the first case
I've worked with Amy

39:30.143 --> 39:33.812
where you have a portal,
shadow people, and a demon.

39:33.814 --> 39:35.680
Honestly, I have no idea
what she's gonna say.

39:35.682 --> 39:39.651
But unfortunately, I got
a feeling you won't like it.

39:45.158 --> 39:47.258
As we were going along,
I'm like,

39:47.260 --> 39:49.561
"Well this could be done
or that could be done."

39:49.563 --> 39:54.999
And then, I went upstairs
to talk to the positive dead.

39:55.001 --> 39:59.737
And what they said, very loud,
very clearly, was, "Move."

40:04.744 --> 40:07.178
There's several things
that you would need to do

40:07.180 --> 40:08.880
prior to moving.

40:08.882 --> 40:13.451
You would need to have
a type of exorcism

40:13.453 --> 40:15.320
of Abbie.

40:15.322 --> 40:18.523
I don't recommend exorcisms
for -- for children,

40:18.525 --> 40:21.960
um, but this is
absolutely necessary.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.329
So the next thing
that needs to be done

40:24.331 --> 40:27.198
is a blessing
for the entire family

40:27.200 --> 40:30.635
before the move,
by a holy person.

40:30.637 --> 40:36.875
And then all three of the kids
should see a psychotherapist.

40:36.877 --> 40:39.744
There's a lot of PTSD
that's going on here

40:39.746 --> 40:41.579
of things that they've seen.

40:41.581 --> 40:42.947
They're gonna be terrified

40:42.949 --> 40:45.183
that this is something
that's gonna happen again.

40:45.185 --> 40:47.151
Do you think that that's...

40:47.153 --> 40:49.921
this thing has probably
caused her condition?

40:49.923 --> 40:51.689
Yes.

40:51.691 --> 40:57.128
And I think her seeing
a psychotherapist will help.

40:57.130 --> 40:59.998
I feel bad for puttin'
my children through this.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.567
I feel like
I've let it happen.

41:02.569 --> 41:08.773
Um, and then also,
I cannot believe it.

41:08.775 --> 41:12.043
You gonna do what
Amy suggests you guys do?

41:12.045 --> 41:14.112
- We'll move.
- Okay.

41:14.114 --> 41:16.681
Wishing we would've
done it earlier.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.416
I'm willing to do anything.

41:18.418 --> 41:19.884
Well, the thing is,
you're gonna have a fresh start

41:19.886 --> 41:21.519
and get your kids back.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.054
You can live in a tent.

41:23.056 --> 41:25.690
What-- whatever you need to do,
as long as your family's safe.

41:25.692 --> 41:28.493
As long as I still have them,
that's all that matters.

41:28.495 --> 41:30.895
Right.

41:30.897 --> 41:33.398
Between a demon, a portal,
and shadow people,

41:33.400 --> 41:36.634
the only way Donna and Andy
can protect their family

41:36.636 --> 41:39.370
is to move as far away
as possible.

41:39.372 --> 41:42.607
If they do that and exorcise
the demon attached to Abbie,

41:42.609 --> 41:45.343
they should lead
a peaceful life.
