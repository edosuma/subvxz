00:01.366 --> 00:02.533
Hey, folks. Don't you weep,
don't you bawl.

00:02.534 --> 00:04.970
Today we're working drywall.

00:08.207 --> 00:11.843
Right, all?

00:11.844 --> 00:13.377
You have to forgive tim.

00:13.378 --> 00:16.213
His sense of humor's
a little off the drywall.

00:17.984 --> 00:21.786
Today we're gonna show you
how to tape the joints
of your wallboard together.

00:21.787 --> 00:24.555
That's right.
Taping technique is critical.

00:24.556 --> 00:28.893
An inferior job can result
in unsightly lumps and bulges.

00:32.197 --> 00:35.500
Kind of makes you wonder
who taped up al.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.606
Well, there are many
mechanical tools
used in drywalling.

00:41.607 --> 00:46.611
I like to use the binford 6100
wet-tape banjo.

00:46.612 --> 00:48.847
With the wet-tape banjo,
you can apply your tape

00:48.848 --> 00:50.649
And your mixture
in one swipe,

00:50.650 --> 00:52.517
As well as doing a good
rendition of "oh, susanna."

00:52.518 --> 00:56.187
♪ oh, susanna,
oh, don't you cry for me
<i>(drumming)</i>

00:56.188 --> 00:58.189
As you can see...

00:58.190 --> 01:00.859
♪ for I came from alabama
with a banjo on my knee

01:00.860 --> 01:04.095
I've loaded my banjo with
quality premix compound,

01:04.096 --> 01:06.464
Available at
any hardware store.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.466
<i>(energetic drumming continues)</i>

01:15.708 --> 01:17.809
<i>(drumming stops)</i>

01:17.810 --> 01:21.312
You don't have to buy it
premixed. You can mix it
yourself if you want.

01:21.313 --> 01:24.649
It's three parts calcium
carbonate, two parts mica,

01:24.650 --> 01:28.252
A little galliano,
a little vodka, you got
a harvey dry wallbanger.

01:28.253 --> 01:32.223
Well, as I'm sure tim realizes,
if you are going to mix
your own compound,

01:32.224 --> 01:35.493
You have to be exactly sure
of its consistency.

01:35.494 --> 01:38.963
I'll put my banjo up
against anybody's.

01:38.964 --> 01:42.200
Would that be
a challenge, tim?

01:49.975 --> 01:52.510
Get ready to duel, fool.

01:55.981 --> 01:57.448
Klaus!

Dad, the hot rod

03:44.623 --> 03:48.026
Yeah, thanks.
Except for one thing.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.494
I was staring it
a little while yesterday.

03:50.495 --> 03:51.996
A little while?

03:51.997 --> 03:55.099
Eight hours. All right.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.367
What it needs

03:56.368 --> 03:58.502
Is an original
'33 hood ornament.

03:58.503 --> 04:00.238
I'm waiting for...

04:04.076 --> 04:06.077
Deke!

04:06.078 --> 04:07.511
Oh, hi, ashley.

04:07.512 --> 04:10.414
No. Brad's not here.
He's out buying you a big gift.

04:10.415 --> 04:12.817
Dad, why'd you
tell her that?

04:12.818 --> 04:14.819
'cause I'm waiting
for an emergency call
for a hood ornament.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.956
I want to keep
the lines clear.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.690
So now I have to buy
ashley a present.

04:20.692 --> 04:24.095
No. Now you have to

04:31.237 --> 04:35.173
Well, hi!
Good day at work?

04:35.174 --> 04:38.609
Tim. I feel like
I'm about to explode.

04:38.610 --> 04:42.513
Don't do it in here.
We just waxed.

04:42.514 --> 04:46.184
Remember I told you about
that big meeting I had
with my boss today?

04:46.185 --> 04:48.386
I was expecting a raise
and a promotion?

04:48.387 --> 04:50.188
She laid me off!

04:50.189 --> 04:52.456
What?
Yeah.

04:52.457 --> 04:55.693
I got two weeks' severance pay
and a farewell cake.

04:55.694 --> 04:58.162
Like a cake is gonna
make me feel better.

04:58.163 --> 05:00.265
Well, did you bring
the cake home?

05:02.301 --> 05:04.635
Did it have nuts on it?

05:04.636 --> 05:09.573
For your information,
it was a triple chocolate fudge.

05:09.574 --> 05:13.945
I was so depressed that I
polished the rest of it off
in the car on the way home.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.547
Now, I need a little
sensitivity and a...

05:16.548 --> 05:19.017
...Thighmaster.

05:20.485 --> 05:24.289
Well, you came to the house
of sensitivity. Right, guys?

05:24.290 --> 05:27.525
Is this gonna affect
my allowance?

05:27.526 --> 05:30.461
It will now.

05:30.462 --> 05:33.131
Stay off the phone.

05:33.132 --> 05:36.734
Tell me what happened.
Business bad down there?
Did they lay everybody off?

05:36.735 --> 05:40.204
Oh, no, no. Just me.
They didn't lay off becky.

05:40.205 --> 05:42.974
The pretty one?
Yeah.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.775
Yeah, the pretty one.

05:44.776 --> 05:46.377
The one with
the harvard degree

05:46.378 --> 05:50.781
And the pair of
ph. Double ds.

05:50.782 --> 05:53.051
Yeah, bright girl.
Yeah.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.355
Thanks.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.657
Jill, come on.
Come on, come on.

05:59.658 --> 06:03.561
I'm sorry about your job.
I know what it meant
to you. I really do.

06:03.562 --> 06:07.165
Hey, you want a shoulder
to cry on? Pick one.

06:10.102 --> 06:13.204
I gave them
two years of my life.

06:13.205 --> 06:16.441
<i>(phone rings)</i>

06:23.515 --> 06:26.217
Two years of
total dedication.
Yeah.

06:26.218 --> 06:30.288
The writers, the editors,
they all said that
they liked me the best.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.490
Yeah.
I had such a nice desk.

06:32.491 --> 06:34.758
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Tim, I was talking to you.

06:34.759 --> 06:35.926
Hello?
Hold on a second.

06:35.927 --> 06:37.795
Maybe one of the kids
got in an accident.

06:37.796 --> 06:40.798
I thought that
they were all home.
Hold on a minute.

06:40.799 --> 06:44.335
Most of the accidents
take place in the home.

06:44.336 --> 06:48.373
Hey. Hey, deke? What are you
doing? Ah. Hold on a second.

06:48.374 --> 06:49.974
Thank god
the kids are ok.

06:51.743 --> 06:53.644
Yes!

06:53.645 --> 06:55.346
Well, all right. Ok.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.548
Call me any time,
day or night, I'm here.

06:57.549 --> 07:00.051
Thank you, buddy.
Thanks. Bye.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.120
Great news.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.623
Deke thinks he knows a guy
that knows a guy that could
get my hood ornament.

07:05.624 --> 07:08.292
Yay, deke.

07:08.293 --> 07:10.995
Come on!
Deke's a great guy.

07:10.996 --> 07:13.764
He's got connections
everywhere.

07:13.765 --> 07:17.435
Maybe he knows a guy who knows
a guy who could find me a job.

07:17.436 --> 07:18.969
I think we shouldn't bother him

07:18.970 --> 07:21.972
Because right now he's looking
for a hood ornament for me.

07:27.946 --> 07:33.084
So, how you holding up?
I'm ok, I guess.
I don't know.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.521
Ever wake up in the morning
and feel like you just don't
have a clue?

07:36.522 --> 07:40.824
Every day. Wait.
That's not normal?

07:40.825 --> 07:43.428
Want some orange juice?
Yeah, yeah,
I'd love some.

07:43.429 --> 07:47.031
I stayed up half the night
trying to figure out
what I should do now.

07:47.032 --> 07:49.333
What should I do?
What should I do?

07:49.334 --> 07:51.469
The magazine business
here is so tough

07:51.470 --> 07:53.637
And I don't know if I really
want to do that anymore,

07:53.638 --> 07:56.207
So you know what
I've been thinking?

07:56.208 --> 07:59.410
It's really a stupid idea.
Well, it may not be that stupid.

07:59.411 --> 08:04.048
I mean, people my age have done
it, not that much, but it's not
that it's impossible.

08:04.049 --> 08:06.984
There's a lot to be said for it
and a lot to be said against it.

08:06.985 --> 08:08.119
What do you think?

08:08.120 --> 08:13.191
Well, I'm 50-50 on it myself.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.025
What are you talking about?
Oh...

08:16.728 --> 08:20.498
When I was in school,
I really liked psychology.

08:20.499 --> 08:23.701
I thought that I might
make a good therapist.

08:23.702 --> 08:28.906
Hm. As someone who's been
in therapy forever,
I think you'd be great.

08:28.907 --> 08:32.042
And I blame my mother.

08:32.043 --> 08:34.979
I'm thinking about going back
to school to get my master's.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.414
Then I could be
a family counselor.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.816
You would be a natural
working with families.

08:38.817 --> 08:41.519
Well, after surviving this one,
I should get a purple heart.

08:49.694 --> 08:52.196
Hi, brad.
Hey, mom.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.632
What's this?
Oh.

08:54.633 --> 08:59.170
That's a college catalogue with
watermelon seeds all over it.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.339
I'm checking out colleges.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.608
Well, aren't I
a little young?

09:03.609 --> 09:06.144
It's for me.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.979
Well, then,
aren't you way old?

09:10.582 --> 09:13.384
I'm never gonna get
my allowance back, am I?

09:13.385 --> 09:15.620
It's not looking good.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.289
Hey, brad. Hi, hon.
<i>(both)</i> hi.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.658
I'm glad you're home.

09:20.659 --> 09:22.460
You sound like you're
in a better mood.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.562
Oh, yeah,
I had a great day.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.900
What'd you do? Sit in bed
all day, stuff your face,

09:29.901 --> 09:31.202
Talk to your girlfriends
on the phone?

09:35.874 --> 09:39.510
Is that what you think
my idea of a great day is?

09:39.511 --> 09:43.381
Sorry. That's my idea
of a great day.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.917
Wait till you hear
what I'm thinking about doing.

09:46.918 --> 09:49.687
I want to go back to college.

09:49.688 --> 09:52.790
Are you gonna stay here
or at the dorm?

09:54.259 --> 09:56.994
I'm thinking about getting
my master's in psychology.

09:56.995 --> 09:59.564
I'd have to take some undergrad
courses, but what do you think?

09:59.565 --> 10:03.801
Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.

10:03.802 --> 10:06.470
Jill, a master's degree
will take forever.

10:06.471 --> 10:08.339
It's ok.
I like school.

10:08.340 --> 10:12.042
Do you remember school?

10:12.043 --> 10:16.314
Homework, detention,
being suspended,
sitting in the corner.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.048
Tim, they don't
do that in college.

10:18.049 --> 10:21.285
Oh, yeah?

10:21.286 --> 10:24.755
How much is
this gonna cost?

10:24.756 --> 10:27.225
How much did
the hot rod cost?

10:27.226 --> 10:30.794
How mu...
Cost is not the issue here.

10:30.795 --> 10:33.997
Tim, this is something
that I want to do.

10:33.998 --> 10:36.200
Why psychology? I thought
you liked journalism.

10:36.201 --> 10:37.602
Don't you like
being a researcher?

10:37.603 --> 10:40.204
I did. But now I want to
move in a new direction.

10:40.205 --> 10:42.373
I'm going through
a major life change.

10:42.374 --> 10:44.375
The facial hair thing?

10:46.245 --> 10:47.778
No, tim.

10:47.779 --> 10:49.780
<i>(gruffly)</i> thank goodness
for that.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.952
Do you remember when
you quit being a salesman
to do <i>tool time?</i>

10:54.953 --> 11:00.558
It was important to you
and I was very supportive.
Do you remember that?

11:00.559 --> 11:03.494
I'd support you too if you did
something that made sense.

11:03.495 --> 11:06.230
Why don't you go to
a trade school?
Trade school?

11:06.231 --> 11:09.433
Six months, you can be
a turret lathe operator.

11:09.434 --> 11:12.303
I don't want to be
a turret lathe operator.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.672
I don't even know
what that is.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.240
That's why you go
to the school.

11:17.909 --> 11:21.078
How about a certified
arc welder?
Are you insane?

11:21.079 --> 11:23.281
Diesel bus repair.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.583
I was excited
about this idea.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.451
I'm trying to have
a serious conversation,

11:27.452 --> 11:30.588
And all you can do is throw out
idiotic suggestions.

11:30.589 --> 11:33.324
Why don't you just tell me
to go to clown college?

11:33.325 --> 11:36.694
They'd never take you.

11:36.695 --> 11:40.130
You're not funny enough
and your feet are too small.

11:43.602 --> 11:47.137
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>(audience)</i> tool time!

11:47.138 --> 11:49.473
That's right.
Binford tools
is proud to present

11:49.474 --> 11:52.443
Tim "the tool man" taylor. Whoo!

11:52.444 --> 11:54.578
<i>(applause)</i>

11:57.716 --> 11:59.383
Thank you, heidi.

11:59.384 --> 12:03.887
Thank you, everybody. Welcome to
drywall week here on <i>tool time.</i>

12:03.888 --> 12:05.523
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,

12:05.524 --> 12:09.360
And you all know my assistant,
plump al stiltskin.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.996
<i>(audience cheering)</i>

12:12.997 --> 12:16.166
Thank you. Thank you.

12:16.167 --> 12:21.238
I'm wearing these stilts to
show you a handy way to put
up drywall ceiling panels.

12:21.239 --> 12:24.508
After that, al's gonna juggle
and bounce a big rubber ball
on his nose.

12:24.509 --> 12:26.844
<i>(hums circus music)</i>

12:29.214 --> 12:31.549
We'll be working with
a ten-foot ceiling today

12:31.550 --> 12:33.984
So I have my stilts
set to 36 inches.

12:33.985 --> 12:36.286
They're adjustable
all the way to 48 inches.

12:36.287 --> 12:38.622
The stilts or your belt?

12:42.761 --> 12:45.229
The advantage of stilts
when drywalling

12:45.230 --> 12:48.766
Is they do give you height,
plus mobility.

12:55.874 --> 12:58.308
Each of these panels
weighs 60 pounds,

12:58.309 --> 13:00.578
So it's always a good idea
to have a good helper.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.514
Or, if you're in a bind...
Tim.

13:06.284 --> 13:10.421
Now, if you don't happen to have
a drywall lift, like this here,

13:10.422 --> 13:13.323
You can hold up your panels
with t-braces, called "deadmen."

13:13.324 --> 13:16.360
Tim, show them
what a dead man looks like.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.435
This is all well and good
if you have a traditional
ten-foot ceiling,

13:24.436 --> 13:28.806
But let's say I want to do
a remodel on the sistine chapel.

13:28.807 --> 13:32.376
Well, I don't think you'd
be their first choice
as contractor.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.916
Stick with me here, ok?

13:38.917 --> 13:41.985
Guys, raise this up
to the sistine chapel level.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.223
Let's say
you want to smooth out

13:46.224 --> 13:48.559
Those chubby cherubs
with some wallboard,

13:48.560 --> 13:51.228
But the stilts only
go up to 48 inches.

13:51.229 --> 13:53.497
That's why I use these.
Heidi?

13:55.233 --> 13:58.302
My pneumatic drywall stilts.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.241
Pneumatic drywall stilts?

14:04.242 --> 14:06.777
Is there an echo
in the building?

14:08.212 --> 14:10.748
How high can they go?
The sky's the limit.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.216
Want to go up,
press this lever up.

14:14.886 --> 14:19.156
Third floor, lingerie.
Ding ding ding.

14:19.157 --> 14:22.225
I'm very impressed, tim.

14:22.226 --> 14:24.127
Watch this. I want to
reverse the process,

14:24.128 --> 14:28.532
And go down to the bargain
basement where you picked up
that shirt, press here.

14:40.745 --> 14:42.212
Hey, randy.
Hey, dad.

14:42.213 --> 14:44.715
Great day today.
Good <i>tool time</i> ?

14:44.716 --> 14:46.917
Through the roof.

14:49.053 --> 14:51.121
Uh...

14:51.122 --> 14:55.092
How's mom?
Not too bad.
She finally stopped saying,

14:55.093 --> 14:59.262
"boys, whatever you do,
don't turn out to be
like your father."

14:59.263 --> 15:03.834
Ok. Well, this'll put her
right over the top.

15:03.835 --> 15:05.736
Do flowers always work?
Yep.

15:05.737 --> 15:08.672
Every time I get in trouble,
I just call lou the florist.

15:08.673 --> 15:14.244
She gets mad at you so often,
you must be on some kind of
"frequent flower" program.

15:15.881 --> 15:19.617
I'm not only a member,
I'm the club president.

15:22.988 --> 15:25.255
Bet you can't guess
what I've got behind my back.

15:25.256 --> 15:30.861
Seven roses, 16 daisies,
two tulips and a couple of
sprigs of baby's-breath.

15:33.398 --> 15:36.233
Right on the money.
That's amazing!

15:36.234 --> 15:38.035
It's not that unusual.

15:38.036 --> 15:42.973
This is the 29th time
I've gotten that exact
same bouquet of flowers.

15:42.974 --> 15:48.913
Lou the florist calls it
his "tim taylor
foot-in-the-mouth" special.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.214
Don't knock it.
Because of this bouquet,

15:51.215 --> 15:54.585
Lou has been able to send his
son to a fabulous trade school.

15:54.586 --> 15:58.956
He's a turret lathe
operator now.

15:58.957 --> 16:05.328
Well, at least you get flowers.
Joe gives me a string of sausage
and a side of canadian bacon.

16:05.329 --> 16:07.765
See how lucky you are?

16:07.766 --> 16:10.734
Joe screws up, a pig dies.

16:14.405 --> 16:18.475
Good luck, tim. You'll need it.
Thanks for the basil.

16:18.476 --> 16:21.612
Tim, why did you
give me these flowers?

16:21.613 --> 16:24.949
Was it so that I wouldn't
be mad at you anymore?

16:24.950 --> 16:26.750
Yes.

16:26.751 --> 16:30.654
If you'd just
given me the flowers

16:30.655 --> 16:34.091
To show me that you supported
my idea of going back to school,

16:34.092 --> 16:36.159
I would have been
so happy about that.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.730
Isn't that amazing?
That's exactly why
I bought them.

16:39.731 --> 16:43.233
I love our relationship.
We know what each other's
thinking.

16:43.234 --> 16:44.768
Then you know what
I'm thinking right now?

16:44.769 --> 16:49.406
I think you're thinking
that I wasted... $27.95.

16:55.046 --> 16:58.816
Hey, wilson.
Want some flowers?

16:58.817 --> 17:01.418
Why, tim,
what a neighborly gesture.

17:01.419 --> 17:03.821
It'll cost you 35 bucks.

17:05.624 --> 17:11.328
If I'm not mistaken, that is
the $27.95 "tim taylor
foot-in-your-mouth" special.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.363
Yeah.

17:13.364 --> 17:17.200
I tried to use them to say
I'm sorry to jill.
She didn't want them.

17:17.201 --> 17:19.103
She wants to go back
to school and was mad

17:19.104 --> 17:21.771
'cause she doesn't think
I'm being very supportive.

17:21.772 --> 17:24.642
Well, do you feel
that you are?

17:24.643 --> 17:28.278
I guess that depends
on your definition of
"supportive."

17:28.279 --> 17:32.616
I told her it was a stupid idea
and she probably couldn't get
into clown college.

17:36.354 --> 17:39.523
I don't think that's
anyone's definition
of supportive.

17:39.524 --> 17:43.560
Going back to school,
it's really a big deal to her.

17:43.561 --> 17:46.263
I couldn't wait to
get out of college.

17:46.264 --> 17:49.599
And to be honest,
the college couldn't wait
to get me out of there.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.870
Wasn't it college
where you met jill?

17:52.871 --> 17:57.675
Yeah. It wasn't easy. I was
a motorhead and she hung out
with all the intellectuals.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.076
You know the type.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.378
Spend their days thinking
about the meaning of life

18:01.379 --> 18:06.583
When they could be figuring out
how to drink a keg of beer
without using their hands.

18:06.584 --> 18:10.020
I'm not looking forward to
her getting back in a group
of eggheads -

18:10.021 --> 18:14.725
People who are always trying to
prove how smart they are
by talking over your head.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.427
So, tim,
you're worried about jill

18:17.428 --> 18:19.529
Returning to
the world of academia.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.833
It was a lot of work to get her
interested in me in college.

18:22.834 --> 18:26.837
Maybe she goes back
and hangs out with all
those intellectual types,

18:26.838 --> 18:29.707
Maybe she won't find me
that interesting again.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.210
Just because jill grows
doesn't mean that she'll
grow apart from you.

18:33.211 --> 18:35.679
No, no, no.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.414
Heck.

18:37.415 --> 18:39.183
What am I talking about?

18:39.184 --> 18:42.485
Why would she trade me in
for a new model

18:42.486 --> 18:45.823
When she got a v8 like me
sitting in the garage at home?

18:45.824 --> 18:47.457
<i>(wilson chuckles)</i>

18:47.458 --> 18:50.928
You are a classic.
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah.

18:53.698 --> 18:57.735
Jill. Don't expect me to
help you with your homework.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.402
What?

18:59.403 --> 19:03.207
When you go back
to study psychology.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.475
Wait. You're ok with that?

19:05.476 --> 19:07.811
If your dream
is to work with nuts,

19:07.812 --> 19:10.714
You should go back to
the world of macadamia.

19:14.219 --> 19:19.123
You wanna go back and get your
master's, I totally support it.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.792
You really mean that?
Absolutely.

19:21.793 --> 19:25.362
Oh, thank you, honey.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.966
I'll take these now.

19:28.967 --> 19:32.136
You realize, with me studying
and being in school,

19:32.137 --> 19:35.305
That things are gonna change
a little bit around here.

19:35.306 --> 19:41.779
Hm. If there's adjustments
to be made on the house,
I'll make 'em.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.749
No. Forget about
the adjustments.
Just be supportive.

19:45.750 --> 19:49.052
I'm so excited about
going back to school!

19:49.053 --> 19:53.924
I get to buy a new three-ring
binder and knee-socks.

19:53.925 --> 19:58.461
I never told you this,
but at school, I always thought
you were out of my league.

19:58.462 --> 20:01.064
I was.

20:01.065 --> 20:05.903
And I guess I was worried that
you'd find a new group of

20:05.904 --> 20:09.006
Brainiacs to hang out with.

20:11.642 --> 20:15.179
Well, maybe you'll come home
to me, I'll be kinda boring.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.014
<i>(laughs)</i>

20:17.015 --> 20:22.552
One thing about coming home to
you, tim, it's never boring.

20:22.553 --> 20:24.354
Let me ask you a question.

20:24.355 --> 20:27.324
Have you ever wished that
you'd married somebody
as smart as you?

20:27.325 --> 20:31.862
You think I'm smarter
than you?
Yeah.

20:31.863 --> 20:37.100
Well, that just shows
how smart you are.

20:38.402 --> 20:39.903
You didn't answer
the question.

20:41.439 --> 20:46.376
Do I ever wish that
I married somebody else?

20:48.012 --> 20:51.548
Why would I wanna
marry anybody else?

20:51.549 --> 20:54.918
You're funny,
you're sexy,

20:54.919 --> 20:57.988
Creative,
you take chances,

20:57.989 --> 21:01.291
And you're definitely
not afraid to be wrong.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.999
I'm perfectly happy being
married to a man who thinks that

21:09.000 --> 21:13.070
Pbs is something that
women get once a month.

21:17.441 --> 21:22.980
What I said was,
"once a month is enough for pbs.

21:24.615 --> 21:27.584
And way too much
for the other thing."

21:34.325 --> 21:38.395
You'll never guess
what I got in the box.
Oh, the hood ornament.

21:38.396 --> 21:40.364
No. I had to miss the call.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.932
Deke put me at
the bottom of the list.

21:41.933 --> 21:45.068
Glad you weren't
waiting for a liver.

21:45.069 --> 21:49.172
This is stuff for
your first day at school.

21:49.173 --> 21:53.110
A three-ring binder with
your college sweetheart on it.

21:57.148 --> 21:58.815
Stop laughing,

21:58.816 --> 22:01.518
Otherwise I won't give you
a tim taylor "more power"
pencil sharpener.

22:01.519 --> 22:05.389
Ooh! Let me see this.
Try it out.

22:06.891 --> 22:09.092
<i>(motor starts)</i>

22:14.432 --> 22:19.036
And my best piece...
Your remote-control lunchbox.

22:20.604 --> 22:22.105
Press this.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.987
...To the bargain basement
where you bought that shirt,

22:36.988 --> 22:38.155
Press this button here.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.964
I'm wearing these stilts
to show viewers

22:46.965 --> 22:49.899
A handy way to install
ceiling panels.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.202
After that, just for the kids,

22:52.203 --> 22:53.203
Al's gonna juggle
a ball on his nose

22:53.204 --> 22:55.705
And sing "kumbaya."
