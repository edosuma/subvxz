04:09.615 --> 04:12.494
Jack!

04:17.714 --> 04:20.072
When are you just
gonna clean up?

04:20.980 --> 04:23.054
You know people are
coming to see the house.

04:23.066 --> 04:26.158
- Yeah I'm doing homework.
- Homework?

04:26.194 --> 04:29.417
- Yeah homework.
- You think I'm fools?

04:30.503 --> 04:33.382
- No, I'm working on that.
- Homework.

04:33.389 --> 04:37.453
- I've never seen that before.
- Want me upgrade the computer?

04:37.490 --> 04:39.984
Hey I don't mean to put
pressure on you sweetie,

04:39.996 --> 04:42.384
but you really got
to grade at school.

04:42.911 --> 04:43.978
As good as point a.

04:44.024 --> 04:46.903
I just.. I can't afford college.

04:46.944 --> 04:49.089
You gotta got a scholarship.

04:49.099 --> 04:51.006
Is nothing selling?

04:51.045 --> 04:54.232
6 months, not a house..
Not an apartment.

04:54.243 --> 04:56.368
Hey Mr. Chang says everything
happens for a reason..

04:56.398 --> 04:59.645
Yeah, you know what?
Well Mr. Chang

04:59.656 --> 05:03.803
is not getting his home
foreclosed down in 90 days.

05:04.740 --> 05:06.814
I'm sorry.

05:06.859 --> 05:08.409
I know hes your friend and..

05:08.421 --> 05:12.061
It's really sweet of him to give
you a job and everything, but..

05:12.073 --> 05:14.052
We don't need philosophy.

05:14.089 --> 05:16.269
We need a break.

05:16.314 --> 05:18.328
Hey..

05:18.364 --> 05:22.523
- How's it going with Travis and them?
- Oh it's fine.

05:22.534 --> 05:25.485
- No more bully.
- I just told you.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.599
Okay.

05:28.618 --> 05:31.948
- I love you.
- Love you too.

05:34.839 --> 05:38.169
No more gaming, until you
finish your homework.

05:38.210 --> 05:41.197
- Is that a threat?
- Yup.

05:44.258 --> 05:49.578
I'm the octo man!

05:50.445 --> 05:55.682
- Hector you dork, an octopus has 8 arms.
- Whatever.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.655
Look who's here?

06:21.656 --> 06:24.951

- Come on mate get out of here.

06:42.510 --> 06:46.813
- That's for sure.
- You show him, Travis.

06:46.821 --> 06:48.966
Get away.

06:51.999 --> 06:58.150
- Hey Travis you all right there?
- Oh Travis I'm really sorry.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.296
How many times I gotta tell you?

07:00.341 --> 07:01.443
This is our spot.

07:01.453 --> 07:04.613
You said the park of magnolia was your
spot, you didn't say anything about this.

07:04.651 --> 07:06.630
Any place there's a ramp.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.681
That's ours.

07:08.718 --> 07:10.827
You almost killed me. Twerp.

07:10.838 --> 07:13.717
I'm sorry okay?
It was an accident.

07:13.757 --> 07:16.008
Accident or not..

07:16.121 --> 07:19.143
Still gonna kick your ass.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.269
Not getting away that easy.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.465
Don't let him get away boy!
Let's go!

07:30.509 --> 07:33.567
Hurry boy! Come on!

07:33.603 --> 07:35.890
Go, boy! Let's go boys!

07:45.247 --> 07:48.198
Go, go, go, go!

07:50.182 --> 07:52.327
Oh gate!

08:01.930 --> 08:04.881
Hey watch out kid!

08:11.106 --> 08:13.322

08:13.330 --> 08:15.475
He's that way!

08:22.541 --> 08:24.864
Come on, come on, come on!

08:29.909 --> 08:33.025

Come on, come on, hurry up!

09:12.739 --> 09:14.233
No, no, no!

09:15.650 --> 09:18.743
Wow! Hey! What are you doing?
You're going to the frat party?

09:18.778 --> 09:19.916
- Where did he go?
- Move gentleman, away!

09:19.925 --> 09:22.876
What's your problem?

09:25.243 --> 09:28.265
- Problem again?
- I'm in trouble still.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.453
You should use some of your
movements in your game, Jack.

09:31.464 --> 09:32.543
Kick some butt.

09:32.554 --> 09:35.589
This ain't the gaming world
Mr. Chang, this is real world.

09:35.599 --> 09:37.505
One's get nothing to
do with the other.

09:37.547 --> 09:40.734
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.

09:40.744 --> 09:42.995
Do I.. Do I even look like I
have one awesome brave in me?

09:43.003 --> 09:46.890
Looking and being are 2
different things, young Jack.

09:46.931 --> 09:50.083
On this case.. Here what
you see is what you get.

09:50.094 --> 09:53.246
Well, let's see if I can get
some work out of my employee.

09:53.256 --> 09:55.235
Yeah okay.

09:55.238 --> 09:57.311
How are thing at home?

09:57.358 --> 09:58.580
Moms worried about money.

09:58.592 --> 10:01.671
Real estate markets dead. She
hasn't sold anything in months.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.609
Looks like we're
gonna have to move.

10:03.615 --> 10:05.629
Wish I could do something
to help her out.

10:05.630 --> 10:06.909
Medical app or something?

10:06.951 --> 10:08.752
What's all this?

10:08.758 --> 10:13.096
The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.

10:23.321 --> 10:28.488
- Mr. Chang what's this?
- It has been in my family since.. Forever.

10:31.836 --> 10:35.901
- You like it?
- Yeah I do.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.996
- The dancing Princess.
- Yeah looks like she's breaking.

10:38.997 --> 10:41.011
- You know, like..
- Oh god..

10:41.047 --> 10:42.255
See look?

10:42.264 --> 10:44.373
I don't think so young Jack.

10:44.419 --> 10:49.621
She lived a long.. Long.. Time ago. She
saved a country from the barbarians.

10:49.632 --> 10:52.441
Talk about brave, she was brave.

10:52.482 --> 10:56.677
This little girl can
kick butt big time.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.868
Where do I put it?

10:58.982 --> 11:02.004
- How about your house?
- What do you mean?

11:02.041 --> 11:05.228
I mean.. A present..

11:06.072 --> 11:08.252
- No Mr. Chang.. I can't.. I can't..
- Oh sure you can.

11:08.263 --> 11:10.313
You watch the shop while
I going on vacations.

11:10.348 --> 11:15.491
- Oh but you already paying me for that.
- Bad manners to refuse a gift.

11:19.836 --> 11:22.626
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.908
- Hey so I have an idea.
- What?

11:24.910 --> 11:28.940
This house.. Really kinda
too big for both of us.

11:28.977 --> 11:31.051
I mean when dad was here it was fine.
But now..

11:31.063 --> 11:33.298
You know.. Maybe we should think
about renting our room hall.

11:33.322 --> 11:37.351
To that some kid from
university or something.

11:39.370 --> 11:41.515
What did I do to deserve
a kid like you?

11:41.559 --> 11:43.609
On the lottery?

11:43.645 --> 11:45.695
Night.

12:29.628 --> 12:33.693
- Where is the black knight?
- What?

12:33.729 --> 12:35.839
Hey!

12:36.683 --> 12:39.800
Where is the black knight?

12:40.055 --> 12:44.084
- I.. I'm the black knight.
- You lie! You die!

12:44.086 --> 12:49.229
Black knight, it's octo man.

12:49.266 --> 12:53.532
- Hey wait, wait.
- I'll challenge you to a duel to death.

12:54.479 --> 12:57.667
It is a video game!
It's a video game!

12:57.677 --> 13:01.872
Okay? I just.. I just
want to show you man.

13:07.930 --> 13:11.189
I'm 8 arms now bro.

13:11.267 --> 13:15.391
Okay you see that's the challenger
and that's me, the black knight.

13:16.238 --> 13:17.304
It is true..

13:17.349 --> 13:20.607
Yeah it's me, hey
look when I move..

13:20.617 --> 13:22.761
He moves.

13:22.772 --> 13:25.580
Fight!

13:30.071 --> 13:31.310
You are the winner.

13:31.322 --> 13:34.976
Just you wait man, when I'm
comeback with 12 arms.

13:35.006 --> 13:37.293
- So you are the black knight.
- In the game world, I'm the black knight.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.417
In this world I'm Jack Bronson.

13:42.409 --> 13:45.597
Jack Bronson worthless to me.

13:47.623 --> 13:50.645
But I don't have a choice.

13:53.775 --> 13:56.963
Jack Bronson, I need your help.

13:56.972 --> 13:58.014
For what?

13:58.017 --> 14:02.149
I need you to guard the most
precious treasure of the empire.

14:02.221 --> 14:04.330
Excuse me?

14:07.365 --> 14:10.623
Your majesty, you can go out.

14:12.578 --> 14:16.678
The Princess and future empress.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.059
Hi, I'm Jack.

14:22.101 --> 14:25.194
Anyone who touches the Princess dies.
That is the rule.

14:25.195 --> 14:26.236
No exceptions?

14:26.272 --> 14:30.195
There's no point in having
rule if you have exception.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.388
Sometimes is good to
be a little flexible.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.649
It's useless.

14:35.692 --> 14:39.816
But I don't have a choice.

14:39.827 --> 14:43.927
I'll be back as
soon as possible.

14:43.964 --> 14:47.116
If anything happens to her..

14:59.639 --> 15:03.561
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this
isn't happening, this isn't happening.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.746
- Where are your-weapons?
- My weapons?

15:05.791 --> 15:08.777
Warrior zhao said you
were going to protect me.

15:08.780 --> 15:11.873
To protect me you need to
have skills and weapons.

15:11.908 --> 15:16.103
Hey you know, I.. I think warrior
zhao a little confuse because..

15:16.149 --> 15:18.223
I'm not the black knight.

15:18.234 --> 15:21.493
I don't have skills or weapons.

15:21.535 --> 15:24.557
So warrior zhao was
right, you are worthless.

15:24.559 --> 15:27.652
Okay you know what? Can we start over?
I'm Jack..

15:27.653 --> 15:29.833
- What do I call you?
- Your highness.

15:29.877 --> 15:34.984
- I need a name.
- Sulin.

15:35.022 --> 15:37.071
- Okay.
- I'm hungry Jack.

15:37.072 --> 15:40.023
Bring be swallow nest soup.

15:40.027 --> 15:42.136
Roasted snail, the big kind.

15:42.181 --> 15:46.246
Oh and duck tongue
in hot chilli sauce.

15:46.492 --> 15:49.406
Let's see what I can do.

17:03.408 --> 17:05.518
Not bad.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.343
Su lin?

18:22.654 --> 18:24.633
No, no, no, no.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.900
Hey, just in time.
Hey, how's your sleep?

18:28.910 --> 18:31.091
Great, how did your sleep?

18:31.135 --> 18:33.150
Good.

18:40.380 --> 18:46.459
- Do want to sit down?
- Umm, no, no.

18:46.498 --> 18:50.800
Because I read that it's better for
your digestion if you're standing.

18:52.719 --> 18:54.769
I never heard it.

18:57.029 --> 18:58.167

Yeah, bye bye.

19:20.073 --> 19:23.059
Okay, you gotta come inside.

19:24.140 --> 19:27.126

about that, right?

20:32.750 --> 20:36.909
- Until the last detail.
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later.

20:37.129 --> 20:39.108
You can't do that!

20:39.145 --> 20:41.228
- He want to hit me.
- No, he want to fist bump you!

20:41.230 --> 20:43.173
It's a greeting
like a handshake.

20:43.177 --> 20:44.163
Didn't you hear warrior zhao?

20:44.174 --> 20:46.234
No one can touch a Princess,
you get your heap chopped off.

20:46.235 --> 20:48.309
- That's the rule.
- Ok, maybe where you come from..

20:48.355 --> 20:50.500
That's the rule, but here,
here the rules are different.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.946
When you go back to your world,

20:51.957 --> 20:54.550
you can chop off as many heads
as you want, I promise.

20:54.577 --> 20:57.765
But here, my world my rule, ok?

20:57.775 --> 20:59.884
Ok.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.021
No!

21:04.066 --> 21:06.008
- What are you doing?
- Observing your world,

21:06.047 --> 21:07.274
so I can learn the rules better.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.348
No, no, no, you have
to go back inside.

21:09.349 --> 21:12.466
How am I gonna to learn rules of
your world if I don't see it?

21:12.477 --> 21:15.464
Well you can go out
dressed like that.

21:15.501 --> 21:17.681
- Why not?
- Because..

21:17.691 --> 21:21.850
Because, they will stare and
wonder what the hell is going on.

21:21.896 --> 21:24.989
If I were dressed differently
could I stand here?

21:24.990 --> 21:27.064
- Yes.
- Then call the tailor and have him..

21:27.075 --> 21:30.192
- Make me new cloth.
- We don't get our clothes from the tailor.

21:30.203 --> 21:33.260
Then take me where you do.

21:44.731 --> 21:46.841
This for man.

22:04.439 --> 22:06.725
- You okay?
- What's that?

22:07.741 --> 22:11.734
- That's ice cream, it's food.
- What that feels like?

22:11.738 --> 22:14.925
Well, it's cold and sweet.

22:16.047 --> 22:17.919
I want one.

22:17.924 --> 22:22.261
Ok what flavor do you want? They have chocolate,
vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint..

22:22.303 --> 22:24.353
Umm, I want all of them.

22:24.354 --> 22:26.499
All of them?

22:26.509 --> 22:28.559
Ok.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.890
Ok.

23:21.703 --> 23:24.855
- Girl, you're the shit.
- Hey hey, it's your ice cream.

23:24.866 --> 23:26.845
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- That was fun.

23:26.882 --> 23:30.982
- Yeah, really?
- I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here.

23:30.983 --> 23:32.855
You're welcome.

23:32.895 --> 23:35.181
What do you mean I'm the shit?

23:36.231 --> 23:39.383
When you really like
something, that's what we say.

23:41.271 --> 23:43.522
Hey mom.

23:43.530 --> 23:45.675
- Hello.
- I ate ice cream.

23:45.685 --> 23:48.529
Yeah, I can see that.

23:48.744 --> 23:53.816
Mom, I forget to tell you. Yesterday in
school they asked someone to volunteer..

23:53.819 --> 23:55.869
To take an exchange
student, and...

23:55.904 --> 23:58.197
- Sulin showed up today.
- Oh you fresh out of the boat.

23:58.198 --> 24:01.006
No boat, I came by box.

24:01.014 --> 24:03.158
- What?
- Oh she meant plane.

24:03.203 --> 24:06.260
Plane, because box and plane
are the same in her language.

24:06.261 --> 24:08.477
What's the plane?

24:09.390 --> 24:11.534
- She does it all the time.
- I thought she just gotten here.

24:11.545 --> 24:14.602
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.

24:14.707 --> 24:19.850
I did, I meant that in the
time she's been here.

24:19.886 --> 24:22.102
- Are you ok with this?
- Yeah, I mean..

24:22.110 --> 24:26.270
- No, no, no.
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you.

24:27.185 --> 24:29.330
I am Jack's mom, I am Annie.

24:29.341 --> 24:32.255
I am so hungry.

24:32.295 --> 24:37.497
I am sure we have salad, fresh corn and..
Hamburger.

24:37.508 --> 24:39.618
Sulin do you like hamburgers?

24:39.663 --> 24:41.949
I like snails, like
Jack and me last night.

24:41.957 --> 24:44.872
Last night?

24:45.989 --> 24:52.175
The Chinese grammar, they get their
past and future tenses mixed up a lot.

24:52.210 --> 24:54.258
You know you're
acting very weird.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.370
Why don't you put
the burgers on?

24:56.381 --> 24:59.604
Su lin and I will go make up the
couch and the guess room for her.

24:59.614 --> 25:03.161
I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but
maybe when I get back we can

25:03.173 --> 25:05.597
get to know each
other little better?

25:05.626 --> 25:08.956
Maybe we can go to the
mall, it's the shit.

25:09.797 --> 25:13.055
- Who told you that?
- Jack.

25:16.263 --> 25:18.205
Umm, this is where you
gonna be sleeping.

25:18.208 --> 25:21.301
- She said that?
- To my mom.

25:21.302 --> 25:24.419
- That is ill dude.
- Hector, give me a break.

25:24.430 --> 25:30.711
I don't know, man, the girl is hot.
Things I would do to her..

25:31.659 --> 25:33.910
Good night Hector.

25:34.822 --> 25:39.159
Excuse me, the bed next door
is in the wrong position.

25:39.167 --> 25:43.196
Very bad feng shui,
I can't sleep.

25:52.722 --> 25:55.744
This one good feng shui.

26:20.667 --> 26:21.769
Don't forget to clean the house.

26:21.779 --> 26:24.872
Oh don't worry, you won't recognize
the place when get back.

26:24.873 --> 26:27.965
- Say hi to aunt Sophie.
- Sure.

26:33.109 --> 26:35.432
- Where is she?
- Who the hell are you?

26:35.473 --> 26:38.352
- Where is the Princess?
- Listen man, I don't know, ok?

26:38.358 --> 26:40.503
I am here.

28:38.408 --> 28:40.458
No, no, no!

28:58.046 --> 29:01.233
Jack! Jack!

29:07.292 --> 29:13.786
Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!

30:01.477 --> 30:04.700
Ok, I told you not to let
her outta of your sight.

30:04.745 --> 30:07.767
- You worthless!
- I am not a warrior!

30:07.769 --> 30:08.856
I don't know what
you're expecting.

30:08.880 --> 30:09.982
I was expecting more.

30:09.993 --> 30:14.057
Ok, well how about this for more,
when I saw she was taken by those..

30:14.094 --> 30:17.080
Whatever the hell those I jumped
in and after them, man, ok?

30:17.083 --> 30:17.871
What more do you want?

30:17.882 --> 30:20.484
And by the way, we came the same way
seconds apart, she should be here.

30:20.490 --> 30:23.333
- She's not.
- Well where is she then?

30:23.374 --> 30:25.625
- I don't know.
- How you could not know? I was right behind her.

30:25.633 --> 30:27.683
I was busy!

30:27.719 --> 30:29.698
Maybe she came in and ran out.
She probably outside.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.809
Wait, don't!

30:32.968 --> 30:34.982
Oops.

30:44.472 --> 30:46.486
Ok, ok.

30:46.488 --> 30:48.430
I don't want you to think
I am backing out on you,

30:48.434 --> 30:50.544
but it's not, you know, I got
a lot of homework to do..

30:50.554 --> 30:53.541
So I should getting back by now,
just go back to where I came.

30:53.578 --> 30:55.688
It's not gonna happen.

30:55.733 --> 30:56.871
So I am stuck here,
there's no other way out?

30:56.880 --> 30:58.930
I didn't say that.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.945
- I am not in charge of transportation.
- Well who is?

31:01.990 --> 31:07.192
- The wizard it is.
- And where's the wizard?

31:14.467 --> 31:16.611
Jack Bronson, I won't do that.

31:16.656 --> 31:20.886
- Wake up!
- Stop! Never wake a sleeping wizard.

31:20.897 --> 31:23.776
What? I'll get my
head chopped off?

31:23.782 --> 31:24.991
Yes, how did you know?

31:25.033 --> 31:30.141
Lucky guess. What is it with you people
chopping off heads? I mean, really.

31:30.177 --> 31:32.286
It's effective.

31:41.717 --> 31:43.767
Close the door!

31:49.884 --> 31:51.934
Cut the rope!

32:09.626 --> 32:11.676
Get behind me!

32:28.430 --> 32:30.610
Open the door.

32:32.497 --> 32:33.776
There's like thousands of..

32:33.817 --> 32:36.909
Just open it.

32:45.044 --> 32:47.094
Ok.

32:54.358 --> 33:00.640
Sorry. Hello, what is
your name, young man?

33:00.650 --> 33:04.917
- Jack.
- Oh Jack, welcome Jack.

33:08.157 --> 33:10.231
Is something wrong?

33:10.277 --> 33:13.121
No, you just look a lot
like someone I know.

33:13.127 --> 33:16.385
Is he handsome?

33:17.264 --> 33:18.543
Yes.

33:18.584 --> 33:22.543
Ok, now let's go
find the Princess.

33:22.547 --> 33:24.692
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.758
- Well let's start with the chest.
- The warrior's gate.

33:27.795 --> 33:29.904
- That's the real name.
- And how does it work?

33:29.915 --> 33:32.024
That's complicated.

33:32.035 --> 33:35.022
It has to do with
times, spaces, magic..

33:35.059 --> 33:37.133
And things beyond explaining.

33:37.145 --> 33:40.332
The main thing is
that it's works.

33:40.342 --> 33:42.522
- Then how do I get back.
- Another chest.

33:42.567 --> 33:45.659
There's another chest?
Great, where is it?

33:45.695 --> 33:49.819
Well, that is complicated. I have
to collect four different woods..

33:49.866 --> 33:54.796
From 4 different trees that grow in
four different parts of the country.

33:54.835 --> 33:58.094
North where zippa wood is found.

33:58.103 --> 34:02.132
South where the
spotted bamboo grows.

34:02.170 --> 34:05.357
East where the black
mahogany lives.

34:05.402 --> 34:09.502
And west where the rarest tree
in all the land is found.

34:09.503 --> 34:11.648
That's the only way
to build a new box.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.768
But first let's
find the Princess.

34:13.813 --> 34:15.862
You know where she is?

34:15.864 --> 34:17.938
Another complicated question.

34:17.983 --> 34:21.041
How about an easy one, huh?

34:21.043 --> 34:24.195
Zhao. Tell me about zhao.

34:24.205 --> 34:26.279
That's easy.

34:26.291 --> 34:29.382
Warrior zhao was one of
the seven companions..

34:29.418 --> 34:32.476
Raised from birth by
the sacred monks..

34:32.476 --> 34:35.570
For one thing and
one thing only.

34:35.605 --> 34:37.679
To protect the emperor.

34:37.690 --> 34:40.878
The monks train the 7
companions day and night,

34:40.922 --> 34:48.009
year in and year out, until they
would be most invincible force.

34:48.014 --> 34:52.114
It was their sole purpose in
life to protect the emperor..

34:52.114 --> 34:55.373
While brought peace to the land.

34:55.382 --> 34:59.613
There was not a man alive
who could defeat them.

35:00.492 --> 35:02.743
Except one.

35:03.758 --> 35:09.838
Arun the cruel,
king of barbarians.

35:11.996 --> 35:17.305
As fate would have it. Zhao was on
the mission and they figure it out.

35:17.314 --> 35:20.466
The food has been poisoned.
Feeling the worse.

35:20.511 --> 35:23.391
He rush to protect the emperor.

35:23.396 --> 35:27.626
But he arrived too late.

35:42.304 --> 35:46.404
And then chaos descended
from the north.

35:49.429 --> 35:54.631
And the peace that emperor had work
so hard to built began to fall apart.

35:54.643 --> 35:56.894
With no leader the
army was lost.

35:56.936 --> 36:00.930
The people were lost.

36:01.942 --> 36:05.272
The zhao fought relentlessly but
as great as warrior as he was.

36:05.278 --> 36:09.343
He needed a help of the greatest
warrior that could be found.

36:09.345 --> 36:13.504
And so, by using the cynic stone.
I found you.

36:13.551 --> 36:14.618
Yes.

36:14.628 --> 36:16.982
And we pass through
the warriors gate

36:16.994 --> 36:20.636
to get help protecting the
greatest treasure we possessed.

36:20.641 --> 36:21.849
- Shuman?
- Sulin.

36:21.857 --> 36:24.879
The only one who can rally
the people to defeat.

36:24.916 --> 36:28.945
The barbarians and
save our kingdoms.

36:28.982 --> 36:32.099
But I'm not be able to help him.
He thinks I am worthless.

36:32.146 --> 36:34.255
Oh, you seems might.
But I don't.

36:34.266 --> 36:37.489
- Based on what?
- You're here. You didn't have to be.

36:37.533 --> 36:39.476
You could've stay at home.

36:39.479 --> 36:42.536
That's something
about who you are.

36:42.538 --> 36:44.611
Am I crazy?

36:44.623 --> 36:49.825
And now if you will excuse me.
I have a lot of wood to collect.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.031
See you. Bye-bye.

36:55.016 --> 36:57.267
Come on, let's go.

37:26.471 --> 37:29.422
You know the old saying about
blaming the burial is bad news.

37:29.459 --> 37:30.597
Yes, your highness.

37:30.606 --> 37:34.706
- You believe it's true?
- I hope not, your highness.

37:36.758 --> 37:42.032
Good news, you're getting marry.
Bad news.

37:42.076 --> 37:46.200
Warrior zhao is on his way.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.330
Kill him.

37:52.434 --> 37:56.629
Brutus, not him, kill zhao.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.619
Ups.

37:58.759 --> 38:02.718
- So, I assumed you have a plan.
- I do. Save the Princess.

38:02.757 --> 38:04.807
Prevent the married.

38:06.024 --> 38:08.133
Oh? She is getting married?

38:08.144 --> 38:12.102
Force to. Unless we stop it.

38:12.142 --> 38:16.372
- Ah.. Who is the groom?
- Arun the cruel.

38:17.459 --> 38:19.367
Ah, is it his name?

38:19.371 --> 38:21.675
His full name is arum the cruel, the
horrible, the terrible, the miserable.

38:21.699 --> 38:24.685
But we keep it short. If
the marry takes place..

38:24.689 --> 38:26.869
Once she become empress,
he become emperor.

38:26.878 --> 38:32.021
And once he is an emperor. He will kill
her and the whole country is doom.

38:32.126 --> 38:35.005
Are you finish with dinner?

38:35.046 --> 38:39.146
- I guess.
- Yeah, we sleep.

38:39.217 --> 38:44.359
I know, I know, we are rafting it but
do we have any, blankets and pillows?

38:44.639 --> 38:47.625
Blankets? No.

38:48.775 --> 38:53.705
Pillows. Yes.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.366
Good night.

39:05.354 --> 39:08.447
Let say you have
rescue the Princess.

39:08.482 --> 39:13.720
- Is she have anyone else might to marry?
- Not yet.

39:15.816 --> 39:18.968
Any idea what kind
husband she looking for?

39:19.014 --> 39:22.900
Cause in the little time we
spend together, you know what?

39:23.115 --> 39:27.108
I thought we have something.
You know, connection.

39:27.147 --> 39:30.204
Cause we like the same clothes,
we like the same musics.

39:33.611 --> 39:38.683
- You know, you don't think that..
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.

39:38.686 --> 39:42.953
She's looking for someone
good, someone brave, a hero.

39:44.873 --> 39:46.923
Yeah.

39:46.924 --> 39:50.111
Seized in the right of capital
of chunghai province.

39:50.121 --> 39:57.279
1.600 bricks of silver, 18.000 bricks
of gold. 6 chests of diamonds.

39:57.281 --> 40:01.619
And 26 slaves.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.691
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.

40:05.727 --> 40:07.801
We're under performing
in that department.

40:07.847 --> 40:10.063
Who is in charge of slaves?

40:11.045 --> 40:13.924
My cousin.

40:13.965 --> 40:16.180
Get rid of him.

40:18.170 --> 40:21.393
Brutus, I mean the cousin.
Not him!

40:21.438 --> 40:23.380
Ups.

40:23.383 --> 40:25.528

40:25.539 --> 40:30.646
Now, I know you want to
please me, but next time..

40:30.682 --> 40:34.806
Before you kill someone. Should
we have a signal, maybe?

40:34.853 --> 40:38.953
Like, something like that? Like, signal?
Like that? A signal like that?

40:38.990 --> 40:41.040

40:41.041 --> 40:43.114
- Yes.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.369
Your highness.

40:47.505 --> 40:52.613
Beautiful bride has arrive.
Hello, my love.

40:58.871 --> 41:01.051

41:13.364 --> 41:16.622
- Go! Go!
- Call the tailor for fitting!

41:23.756 --> 41:26.944
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna rain.

41:32.202 --> 41:33.304
There's no cloud.

41:33.349 --> 41:37.307
Not all rain come from cloud.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.629
Oh my god!

41:45.757 --> 41:47.973
Oh my god! Look at this!

41:51.979 --> 41:55.072
What the hell is going on?

41:55.107 --> 41:57.086
He wants me dead.

41:57.123 --> 41:59.339
- So they know we are here?
- They know we're somewhere around here.

41:59.348 --> 42:02.500
So they're just keep shooting arrows
everywhere and hope to get lucky.

42:02.545 --> 42:04.559
We called it the morning shower.

42:04.561 --> 42:07.548
Why don't you wake me up?
I could been dead.

42:07.690 --> 42:09.799
If I want you dead, I
will do it myself.

42:09.844 --> 42:12.866
You have to learn to listen.

42:13.980 --> 42:17.002
- What is said?
- Do not enter.

42:17.004 --> 42:20.156
- And what's in there?
- The unknown land.

42:20.202 --> 42:23.153
- What is in the unknown land?
- Unknown things.

42:23.191 --> 42:27.255
Okay, wait, but.. You are drop
me off to the wizard, right?

42:27.292 --> 42:28.589
- Wrong.
- Okay, look, I really think..

42:28.613 --> 42:30.663
Is about time we thought
about getting me home?

42:30.664 --> 42:33.650
- So do I. Here.
- What is this?

42:33.652 --> 42:36.639
A map. It will take
you to the wizard.

42:36.676 --> 42:41.120
I.. I can't read this. I just want
to go home and you are not helping.

42:42.099 --> 42:46.164
- I gave you a map.
- So basically it's screw you, Jack.

42:46.165 --> 42:48.380
I brought you here against
your will, I kidnapped you,

42:48.390 --> 42:50.348
and now you're not the
person I though you were.

42:50.371 --> 42:53.488
So, adios amigo. You
are not my problem.

42:53.533 --> 42:56.685
Wrong at number one. I
did not kidnap you.

42:56.697 --> 42:58.747
No one need you jump
into that chest.

42:58.782 --> 43:01.875
Right on number two. You
are not my problem.

43:01.910 --> 43:05.940
My problem is to get
through the unknown land.

43:06.011 --> 43:08.085
Get pass the arum's army.

43:08.131 --> 43:10.074
Pass his personal guards.

43:10.078 --> 43:12.093
Pass the terror guards.

43:12.128 --> 43:15.316
Find the Princess, get pass
the tower's reinforcement.

43:15.360 --> 43:18.347
Pass the personal
guard's reinforcement.

43:18.350 --> 43:19.558
Kill arum.

43:19.567 --> 43:23.797
And then bring the Princess back so she
can be made empress who save the country.

43:23.842 --> 43:26.899
That is my problem.

43:37.153 --> 43:39.227
So you're saying I
don't have a choice.

43:39.239 --> 43:44.405
You do have a choice. You can save
yourself or you can save her.

43:46.711 --> 43:51.819
- I can't save a Princess!
- You are the black knight.

43:52.725 --> 43:58.034
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sir, sir..

43:58.981 --> 44:01.031
Sir..

44:01.101 --> 44:03.246
Good news.

44:04.368 --> 44:07.460
Don't be nervous. It's
been my lucky days so far.

44:07.461 --> 44:10.519
- And I've good feeling about this one.
- Yes, sire.

44:10.555 --> 44:13.613
I'm sure, it's good news.

44:13.788 --> 44:15.659
Bad news.

44:15.699 --> 44:20.866
- No, impossible..
- No sign of warrior zhao.

44:24.006 --> 44:26.257
Sire... sire..

44:29.428 --> 44:32.415
Brutus..

44:33.564 --> 44:34.605
No, no..

44:34.606 --> 44:37.758
- Signal, you remember, the signal?
- Signal?

44:37.804 --> 44:40.826
- Kill him!
- No, no, no, no!

44:40.828 --> 44:42.843
Sire! Sire!

44:43.886 --> 44:48.994
I was thinking. This arum dude, maybe if he
gets what he want, he'll change, you know.

44:49.031 --> 44:51.081
Be like arum the kind?

44:51.290 --> 44:55.390
Do you have people in your world who get what
they want by threating to do bad things?

44:55.426 --> 44:57.263
At least there is one kid.

44:57.268 --> 44:59.554
And you give him what he wants.
Does he change?

44:59.597 --> 45:01.540
Not really.

45:01.544 --> 45:04.660
Might does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.

45:04.706 --> 45:06.872
If you don't stand up for what is
right, and why you stand up at all?

45:06.896 --> 45:10.854
You know, that's easy to say. This,
this kid, he is bigger then me.

45:10.858 --> 45:11.960
He's stronger then me.

45:11.971 --> 45:14.151
So what do you do?

45:14.229 --> 45:18.223
- I run.
- Is that solve your problem?

45:19.165 --> 45:21.309
No.

45:27.576 --> 45:29.626
- So you got a girl?
- No.

45:29.627 --> 45:32.779
- Because?
- Because I had my job.

45:32.825 --> 45:35.942
What are your job doesn't
have time for personal life?

45:35.988 --> 45:38.132
My job is my life.

45:40.089 --> 45:42.139
Yeah, it's like much fun.

45:43.356 --> 45:45.299
Pardon?

45:45.302 --> 45:48.525
Yeah, you know. Do things
make you feel good.

45:48.534 --> 45:52.493
I feel good doing my job.

45:52.497 --> 45:55.614
You guys always.. You know, dude.
Come on.

45:56.946 --> 46:01.876
You have seen this before?
No, okay, look.

46:01.916 --> 46:06.218
It's called dancing.
Okay? It's like..

46:12.274 --> 46:15.640
No? Okay, try this.

46:16.583 --> 46:21.691
Well, just, stay still. Open your eyes up.
There you go.

46:22.770 --> 46:24.014
- Magic?
- It's cool.

46:24.022 --> 46:28.051
Okay, I'm lay on the beats. And
you just move your hips, okay?

46:36.534 --> 46:40.421
I don't have time for fun.

46:40.461 --> 46:42.606
Man, come on.

46:50.020 --> 46:53.943
Come on! We don't have all day.

46:58.153 --> 47:00.227
Wow.

47:01.246 --> 47:02.525
Excuse me.

47:02.532 --> 47:04.404
We have to get through.

47:04.444 --> 47:07.702
And I need to finish
cooking my soup.

47:07.711 --> 47:10.591
How long is that going to take?

47:11.673 --> 47:14.790
- All night.
- We don't. We don't have all night.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.170
You do now.

47:20.293 --> 47:22.343
Perhaps, if we move the..

47:22.378 --> 47:26.301
- Respect your elder one!
- No disrespect.

47:26.306 --> 47:29.529
But we have very important mission.
We have to get through.

47:29.539 --> 47:37.539
Well, your really important
mission will have to wait!

47:37.915 --> 47:41.102
For my potatoes dissolvent.

47:41.877 --> 47:43.986
I'm sorry.

47:44.032 --> 47:46.082
- It can't.

Help me up! Zhao!

48:43.467 --> 48:47.496
Come on, Jack! Come on!

48:48.749 --> 48:51.771
I did not let up for last.

49:37.722 --> 49:42.758
I'm on fire! I hate fire!

49:54.335 --> 49:57.523
Maybe not so
worthless after all.

49:58.402 --> 50:00.476
Your welcome.

50:12.061 --> 50:15.178
My bride.

50:16.302 --> 50:19.395
I hope you like your new palace.

50:20.369 --> 50:25.405
In two days time. You will take
your place as heritage. Of course.

50:25.408 --> 50:27.624
You will thrill more be.

50:27.668 --> 50:29.777

50:29.788 --> 50:31.838

happy, my dear.

50:31.873 --> 50:33.947
You want to see me happy?

50:33.994 --> 50:38.959
Just tell me what I need to
do and that would be done.

50:39.138 --> 50:41.152
Well..

50:41.223 --> 50:46.366
Come close and I
will whisper it.

50:46.367 --> 50:48.511
In your ear.

50:48.556 --> 50:51.471
Tell me my love!

50:51.511 --> 50:53.763
My sweet, soul bird.

50:53.805 --> 50:57.905
What do I need to do
to make you happy?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.074
Die!

51:09.238 --> 51:13.575
As much I like to make you happy,
your dying is not on you, love.

51:13.617 --> 51:20.905
However, feeling insist someone
dying, it can be arrange.

51:22.688 --> 51:24.903
Keep her away.

51:24.982 --> 51:27.056
Come on!

51:27.136 --> 51:29.980
Come inside!

51:35.444 --> 51:38.466

51:40.657 --> 51:42.707
Get out!

51:48.860 --> 51:49.998
Invisible woman.

51:50.042 --> 51:54.035
How is the priest people in
place boxes and time travel,

51:54.074 --> 51:55.282
and none of us are weird, is it?

51:55.290 --> 51:58.133
It's not weird.

51:58.209 --> 51:59.382
It just magic.

51:59.426 --> 52:01.405
We don't have magic.

52:01.407 --> 52:04.559
Then how you do explain
what cannot be explain?

52:05.474 --> 52:07.654
We have sains. Sains
is everything.

52:07.698 --> 52:11.798
- Does sains explain rainbow or snowflakes?
- Yes.

52:11.834 --> 52:15.934
But does it explain how you feel when
you see the rainbow or snowflake?

52:15.935 --> 52:20.166
- No. Feeling aren't magic.
- So you do have magic.

52:20.176 --> 52:23.198
- What are they then?
- I don't know. The feeling.

52:23.234 --> 52:27.536
Okay, they make you do and say things you
normally wouldn't do or say, like, like..

52:27.579 --> 52:30.636
If you met this girl that you never knew.
And all the sudden there's..

52:30.638 --> 52:33.552
Can't think anything to say
but you can't stop talking.

52:33.592 --> 52:35.878
And your body like hot and
cold in the same time and...

52:35.886 --> 52:39.951
Your heart is beating like you just run a
mile in a minute... and it's.. It's like..

52:39.988 --> 52:42.902

52:46.244 --> 52:49.195

53:07.064 --> 53:08.971

53:48.736 --> 53:51.723
Oh, thank goodness. Hurry!

53:51.726 --> 53:53.705
Wait... you're... you're twins?

53:53.742 --> 53:55.021
No, we are not.

53:55.028 --> 53:57.078
We're triplets.

53:57.114 --> 54:00.100

54:00.136 --> 54:01.107

54:19.844 --> 54:22.095
Aw! He's a cute one.

54:22.139 --> 54:23.157
Cute one always taste better.

54:23.181 --> 54:26.060
Oh, no. The fat
ones taste better.

54:26.066 --> 54:28.140
The fat ones give me dash.

54:28.185 --> 54:30.295
If you let the blood out,
he'll cooked faster.

54:31.314 --> 54:32.522

56:18.608 --> 56:20.774
Hey, since it seems we're in
trouble every 20 minutes...

56:20.798 --> 56:22.907
Maybe it could be good if
you showed me a few moves.

56:22.919 --> 56:23.890
Just in case.

56:23.926 --> 56:25.941
Martial arts take
many years to learn.

56:25.977 --> 56:28.051
No, I'm not asking
for the whole menu.

56:28.063 --> 56:29.033
Just a little something.

56:29.035 --> 56:31.085
Martial arts do notwork
with a little something.

56:31.121 --> 56:34.178
Well then, a lot of something.
Anything.

56:34.180 --> 56:37.332
Even if I can do one thing to help out
the next time we're in a situation.

56:37.377 --> 56:40.672
Just give me something so
I have a fighting chance.

56:41.514 --> 56:43.588
Please.

56:45.754 --> 56:47.769
Come on.

56:47.804 --> 56:49.878
Come on.

56:52.079 --> 56:55.066
Get up.

56:58.197 --> 57:00.377
Stand a feet apart.

57:00.421 --> 57:01.463
Oh, this is cool.

57:01.499 --> 57:03.514
Bend your knees.

57:03.515 --> 57:04.522
Sorry.

57:04.523 --> 57:06.502
Okay.

57:06.539 --> 57:10.698
Now imagine... there's a
big tree in front of you.

57:10.709 --> 57:12.819
Do you see it?

57:12.899 --> 57:13.870
Yeah.

57:13.872 --> 57:15.045
Is it big?

57:15.054 --> 57:16.096
Yeah.

57:16.097 --> 57:17.068
Okay.

57:17.070 --> 57:22.106
Now, hug it.

57:22.179 --> 57:23.186
Do what?

57:23.188 --> 57:26.280
I mean hug the tree.

57:32.676 --> 57:34.726
Good.

57:35.873 --> 57:37.888
- That's it?
- That's it.

57:37.924 --> 57:40.981
Well, how long do I
have to stay like this?

57:53.356 --> 57:55.404
You know if you're not gonna teach
me, you should just say so.

57:55.405 --> 57:56.447
I am teaching you.

57:56.449 --> 57:57.764
Yeah. Right. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

57:57.770 --> 57:59.820
Hey. Hey, wait.

57:59.855 --> 58:01.834
What are you doing?

58:01.836 --> 58:03.886
Come on.

58:04.860 --> 58:06.934
Now, pay attention.

58:06.946 --> 58:11.283
The secret of all martial
arts is the circle.

58:11.325 --> 58:16.255
When you moved, the
circle moves with you.

58:16.434 --> 58:19.421
Here, let me show you.

58:22.622 --> 58:24.696
Hit me.

58:26.897 --> 58:29.006
Hit me again.

58:37.220 --> 58:39.270
Again.

58:40.348 --> 58:43.465
To understand the circle,
you must make the circle...

58:43.510 --> 58:46.461
Live the circle, now,
the circle is you..

58:46.465 --> 58:49.652
And you are the circle.

58:50.705 --> 58:52.815
Understand?

59:18.789 --> 59:21.075
We move the moment
she says "I do".

59:21.118 --> 59:23.167
First on me.

59:23.168 --> 59:26.011
Directly for the capital.

59:26.018 --> 59:27.226
Second army.

59:27.270 --> 59:28.241
To the ocean.

59:28.277 --> 59:30.457
And the third army?

59:31.267 --> 59:32.369
We have a third army?

59:32.378 --> 59:34.357
Yes.

59:34.395 --> 59:35.518
Just let them robbing village.

59:35.542 --> 59:37.484
Excuse me, sir.

59:37.488 --> 59:38.625
For the wedding canopy.

59:38.634 --> 59:40.885
Red or blue?

59:44.856 --> 59:49.194
Red or blue, my love?

59:54.241 --> 59:56.315
Oops.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.347
And this is called not good.

59:59.384 --> 01:00:00.557
Why, it's beautiful?

01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:03.553
Yes, it is. But the
fortress is over there.

01:00:03.555 --> 01:00:06.778
And it could take days to walk
all the way around the lake.

01:00:06.823 --> 01:00:09.880
Or we could just swim
across in no time.

01:00:11.064 --> 01:00:13.114
No, Jack. It's not possible.

01:00:13.149 --> 01:00:15.164
Why, are there man-eating
fish in there?

01:00:15.165 --> 01:00:16.206
No.

01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:18.317
- Poisonous snakes?
- Nope.

01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:22.427
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.

01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:26.590
So, what's in it
that's a problem?

01:00:26.634 --> 01:00:29.786
I cannot swim.

01:00:30.631 --> 01:00:32.776
You kidding me?

01:00:34.003 --> 01:00:39.004
You... you who can kick the butts of
the entire NFL at the same time...

01:00:39.007 --> 01:00:41.294
And you can't swim, what's
wrong with this picture?

01:00:41.336 --> 01:00:43.173
They never taught...

01:00:43.178 --> 01:00:44.406
Yeah. Oh, come on.
Where you're going?

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:46.338
There's no time to waste.

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:47.347
You're gonna walk?

01:00:47.348 --> 01:00:48.390
We don't have a choice.

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:50.678
Okay, you gotta get over this "you
don't have a choice" thing, alright?

01:00:50.686 --> 01:00:52.594
You do have a choice.

01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:54.611
You're strong and
you're coordinated.

01:00:54.614 --> 01:00:56.829
Alright, maybe, we can
work something else, okay?

01:00:56.873 --> 01:01:00.796
I teach you to swim,
you teach me more...

01:01:03.199 --> 01:01:04.170
Deal?

01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:10.451
Come on.

01:01:14.495 --> 01:01:15.466
Ooh...

01:01:15.502 --> 01:01:16.569
You can do it.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.753
You can do it, come on.

01:01:17.797 --> 01:01:20.641
Trust me.

01:01:20.647 --> 01:01:22.661
Hey, that's it.

01:01:22.697 --> 01:01:24.842
There you go.

01:01:24.956 --> 01:01:27.136
Now, put the shield on.

01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:31.246
Now, hop on.

01:01:33.368 --> 01:01:36.390
- Ooh...
- Hey.

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.536
There you go.

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.604
You having fun?

01:01:41.605 --> 01:01:42.647
Yeah.

01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:45.670
I bet you didn't get too much of
that, growing up the way you did.

01:01:45.672 --> 01:01:47.817
Fun? No.

01:01:47.826 --> 01:01:50.848
So, if you can make
up for that...

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:53.030
Maybe you can come visit me.

01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:56.192
I'll show you around, maybe get my mom
to take us to Disneyland or something.

01:01:56.203 --> 01:01:58.218
I told you.

01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:00.269
I can never take
off from my job.

01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:02.520
Hey, man, look... you... you
really got to get a life.

01:02:02.528 --> 01:02:07.671
When you're responsible for a
life, you don't have a life.

01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:10.588
Okay.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:11.871
You...

01:02:11.878 --> 01:02:15.872
You like go to school to learn
how say things like that?

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:18.020
Like what?

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:21.252
When you're responsible for a
life, you don't have a life.

01:02:21.297 --> 01:02:23.133
What's wrong with it?

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.232
Nothing is wrong, but
that, it's just...

01:02:26.302 --> 01:02:27.546
Sound smart.

01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:28.559
It does?

01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:31.441
Yeah, it does.

01:02:32.732 --> 01:02:34.747
Cool.

01:02:35.722 --> 01:02:36.824
So, what's in Disneyland?

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:37.875
A lot of princesses.

01:02:37.911 --> 01:02:39.014
Oh.

01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:42.045
- A Chinese one, too.
- Oh.

01:02:46.114 --> 01:02:54.114
- Our king will win!
- Our king will win!

01:02:57.723 --> 01:03:00.674
Get down, get down, get down!

01:03:01.928 --> 01:03:03.871
So, you... you do
have a plan, right?

01:03:03.909 --> 01:03:05.889
I've told you the plan.

01:03:05.891 --> 01:03:07.940
Ah, right. Get past the army.

01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:09.099
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.

01:03:09.123 --> 01:03:11.254
- Correct.
- Get past the tower guards. Find the Princess.

01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:13.150
- Get past reinforcements?
- Good.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.292
- Kill arun.
- Exactly.

01:03:14.302 --> 01:03:17.419
Crowned sulin in person
saved the country.

01:03:17.465 --> 01:03:18.506
You learning to listen.

01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:19.478
Yeah.

01:03:19.516 --> 01:03:21.458
The real questions is...

01:03:21.461 --> 01:03:25.799
Do you have a plan to execute...
The plan?

01:03:25.841 --> 01:03:27.713
Hmm?

01:03:27.752 --> 01:03:28.854
Ah, I mean...

01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:33.024
- Who will win?
- Our king will win!

01:03:33.035 --> 01:03:36.022
Our king will win!

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:38.388
Good morning.

01:03:38.389 --> 01:03:40.463
Hmm?

01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:47.633
Great plan.

01:03:47.669 --> 01:03:49.648
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.

01:03:49.649 --> 01:03:51.865
- Are we passed the army?
- Yeah.

01:03:51.908 --> 01:03:55.025
Have we passed the
personal guards?

01:03:55.036 --> 01:03:56.007
Almost.

01:03:56.045 --> 01:03:57.988
Well then, I think
the plan is working.

01:03:57.991 --> 01:03:59.970
I think the plan to
get in is working.

01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:02.152
How about the plan to get out?

01:04:02.197 --> 01:04:04.342
I'm working on it.

01:04:10.469 --> 01:04:12.720
Warrior zhao.

01:04:13.597 --> 01:04:16.927
I'm so honored, that you've come
all this way to attend my wedding.

01:04:16.933 --> 01:04:19.007
I'm not here to
attend your wedding.

01:04:19.054 --> 01:04:22.041
I'm here to attend your funeral.

01:04:27.256 --> 01:04:28.298
And you are?

01:04:28.334 --> 01:04:29.401
He's the black knight.

01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:32.363
I'm not the black knight, okay?
I'm...

01:04:32.366 --> 01:04:33.407
I'm Jack Bronson.

01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:35.553
Jack Bronson.

01:04:35.564 --> 01:04:38.478
I've got good news.

01:04:38.518 --> 01:04:39.761
And I have bad news.

01:04:39.804 --> 01:04:41.819
The good news is...

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:45.944
Tomorrow... when my bride
and I are married.

01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:50.055
We will stand... there.

01:04:50.126 --> 01:04:54.285
And you two... will stand...

01:04:54.367 --> 01:04:56.441
There.

01:04:57.495 --> 01:04:59.402
Okay, what's the bad news?

01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:02.558
As soon as we've
taken our vows...

01:05:02.604 --> 01:05:05.792
You know, new life begins...

01:05:13.101 --> 01:05:16.088
Your life ends.

01:05:28.672 --> 01:05:29.809
He's not bluffing, is he?

01:05:29.854 --> 01:05:31.726
Arun doesn't do bluffs.

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.870
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous 'cause
it his wedding day, and he'll pardon us.

01:05:34.894 --> 01:05:35.996
Arun doesn't do generous.

01:05:36.005 --> 01:05:38.130
Okay, if he doesn't do this
and he doesn't do that...

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.175
Is there anything
that he does do?

01:05:40.176 --> 01:05:42.285
Well, he rapes,
murders, and pillagers.

01:05:42.331 --> 01:05:43.398
I guess in another
words we're dead.

01:05:43.409 --> 01:05:48.340
When one door closes,
another one opens.

01:05:50.603 --> 01:05:52.653
See?

01:05:54.635 --> 01:05:57.752
Dinner is served.

01:06:02.004 --> 01:06:03.142
Urgh...

01:06:03.151 --> 01:06:06.244
I was not expecting that.

01:06:07.148 --> 01:06:08.321
It's time to eat.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:11.351
Uh... excuse me?

01:06:11.353 --> 01:06:14.340
Uh... would you mind...

01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:17.678
You know, so we can...

01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:20.622
Thank you.

01:06:24.874 --> 01:06:26.983
Here.

01:06:53.966 --> 01:06:57.189
Guys, I'm.. I'm looking
for the Princess.

01:06:57.198 --> 01:06:59.343
You know where she is?

01:07:04.393 --> 01:07:04.629
What now?

01:07:04.635 --> 01:07:06.709
Now is the time to use
what I've taught you.

01:07:06.721 --> 01:07:07.692
I'm not ready.

01:07:07.729 --> 01:07:08.771
Of course, you are.

01:07:08.772 --> 01:07:09.814
You're the black knight.

01:07:09.815 --> 01:07:11.722
You have skills.

01:07:11.726 --> 01:07:12.864
Okay, I don't... I don't get it.

01:07:12.873 --> 01:07:15.943
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm
worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?

01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:18.953
It's not just me who thinks
you're not worthless, Jack.

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:23.091
The way the Princess looks at you..
She believes in you.

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:26.315
- She does?
- Now, go rescue her. Go!

01:07:29.452 --> 01:07:30.494
What's up?

01:07:30.495 --> 01:07:32.545
Hmm?

01:08:04.035 --> 01:08:08.135
- Jack! Jack!
- Oh!

01:08:08.136 --> 01:08:09.938
You okay?

01:08:09.979 --> 01:08:12.195
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

01:08:12.239 --> 01:08:15.225
You came to save me.

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:18.450
I guess.

01:08:19.537 --> 01:08:22.488
I knew you will.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:27.740
You did?

01:08:28.852 --> 01:08:31.908
From the very first.

01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:41.292
Princess!

01:08:41.294 --> 01:08:42.265
Zhao.

01:08:42.303 --> 01:08:44.554
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:48.582
I'm sorry I came
late to save you.

01:08:49.602 --> 01:08:52.968
Okay, plan, we did it. Um...
How do we get out of here?

01:08:53.877 --> 01:08:54.848
I'm working on it.

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:56.077
You better work fast,
they're coming.

01:09:01.106 --> 01:09:02.173
How many?

01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:04.234
I... I don't know. 25?

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.363
I need to know exactly how many.

01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:12.505
1, 2, 3...

01:09:12.542 --> 01:09:16.736
4, 5, 6, 7...

01:09:16.747 --> 01:09:18.892
8, 9, 10...

01:09:18.902 --> 01:09:21.011
13, 14, 15...

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:23.000
27, 28, 29...

01:09:23.002 --> 01:09:24.045
30!

01:09:24.046 --> 01:09:25.017
30?

01:09:25.054 --> 01:09:26.024
30.

01:09:26.027 --> 01:09:26.264
Are you sure?

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:27.242
Yeah!

01:09:27.278 --> 01:09:29.149
Hurry! Follow me! Follow me!

01:09:29.154 --> 01:09:30.197
31!

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.519
31! 31!

01:09:51.156 --> 01:09:54.273
26, 27, 28, 29...

01:09:56.509 --> 01:09:59.318
How?

01:09:59.568 --> 01:10:01.713
Don't move. Don't move!

01:10:04.607 --> 01:10:06.657
Don't move.

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:24.592
That worked.

01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:33.730
Why do you still have this on?

01:10:33.769 --> 01:10:35.914
I like it.

01:10:43.396 --> 01:10:46.418
Come on. Get on.

01:10:46.455 --> 01:10:48.327
Go.

01:10:48.367 --> 01:10:52.775
Are you on? Are you on? Get on!

01:11:08.352 --> 01:11:12.275
Go. Come on.

01:11:14.434 --> 01:11:17.586
We almost there.

01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:32.228
Come on.

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:47.695
Amazing animals.

01:11:49.052 --> 01:11:54.089
Raise each and everyone
of them from birth.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:57.078
I've fed them by hand.

01:11:57.081 --> 01:12:00.174
Nurse them when they were sick.

01:12:00.209 --> 01:12:04.369
They are more loyal
than all my men.

01:12:05.527 --> 01:12:08.549
They would die for me.

01:12:08.551 --> 01:12:11.703
As well the two of you.

01:12:11.783 --> 01:12:12.885
And you my dear..

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.082
By this time tomorrow, you and
I will be husband and wife.

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:21.235
Emperor and empress.

01:12:22.106 --> 01:12:25.294
Allow me, my love.

01:12:38.963 --> 01:12:42.921
Take them away.

01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:54.594
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:57.554
Last smoke, last meal..

01:12:57.593 --> 01:13:00.709
So you know what you missing.

01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:03.813
Damn.

01:13:13.233 --> 01:13:15.378
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.

01:13:15.423 --> 01:13:17.532
- They gonna kill us.
- You should try.

01:13:17.543 --> 01:13:21.572
- It's actually pretty good.
- I don't care if it the best food in the world, man.

01:13:21.609 --> 01:13:24.667
I'm still a kid.

01:13:24.703 --> 01:13:26.753
And my whole life head to me.

01:13:26.754 --> 01:13:29.847
There's a million things I'm
never gonna be able to do.

01:13:29.882 --> 01:13:31.932
Like what?

01:13:31.968 --> 01:13:35.060
Dude, I never been kiss a girl.

01:13:38.154 --> 01:13:41.271
Me neither.

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.668
You know, I was that close
before you came to the room.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:49.621
Yeah. That's not the point.

01:13:49.624 --> 01:13:53.961
- With the Princess? How close?
- That's not the point.

01:14:19.967 --> 01:14:22.076
- What was that?
- A butterfly.

01:14:22.086 --> 01:14:25.073
- You spoke to the butterfly?
- Apparently.

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:30.384
- Are they understood you?
- Hopefully.

01:15:00.598 --> 01:15:08.598
Long live the king! Long live the king!
Long live the king!

01:15:09.913 --> 01:15:15.055
We are gather at here today
to witness the marriage of..

01:15:15.092 --> 01:15:20.294
Arun the cruel, the ruin,
the horrible, the terrible.

01:15:20.305 --> 01:15:24.607
- The strong!
- Can we move it along?

01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:34.997
- Hey, I want to say thank you.
- For what?

01:15:36.084 --> 01:15:38.194
Try to turn me to be warrior.

01:15:38.204 --> 01:15:41.119
You were warrior from
the beginning, Jack.

01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:45.189
On the inside. It just
had to be brought out.

01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:48.378
- Yeah, a lot a good did..
- It's not over yet.

01:15:48.389 --> 01:15:49.581
What do you mean
this not over yet?

01:15:49.605 --> 01:15:52.556
In the minute, she's gonna
be marriage and we'll die.

01:15:52.559 --> 01:15:55.782
Jack, worrying it's not
gonna change anything.

01:15:55.826 --> 01:15:58.777
Just live in the moment.

01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.890
No offense, but I think
we don't have a moment.

01:16:00.935 --> 01:16:05.130
Do you arun take su lin in
sickness and in health..

01:16:05.176 --> 01:16:09.205
- For better and the worse?
- I do, she does.

01:16:09.207 --> 01:16:12.395
And goes to be my wife.

01:16:12.441 --> 01:16:18.592
To make it official, you
must now kiss the bridge.

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:45.701
- Hello.
- Wizard!

01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:46.840
How can you get here?

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:50.038
See? It's simple.

01:16:50.082 --> 01:16:53.174
- Now just go safe her.
- Wait, wait, how?

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:57.133
- Jump.

01:16:57.138 --> 01:17:00.325
- There's another jump powder.
- Come on.

01:17:01.308 --> 01:17:04.425
- There you go. Now jump.
- Jump how?

01:17:04.436 --> 01:17:06.617
What do you mean now, this
powder hasn't do specific.

01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:09.613
- You can do it, Jack.
- Jump!

01:17:09.616 --> 01:17:11.902
Okay.

01:17:28.558 --> 01:17:31.509
Come on.

01:17:32.764 --> 01:17:35.821
That way!

01:17:55.564 --> 01:17:58.585
Su lin.

01:18:08.111 --> 01:18:12.070
Whoa, would you stop that, please.
It's totally buzz kill.

01:18:14.194 --> 01:18:17.346
Now, come on. Let's go.

01:18:22.605 --> 01:18:25.698
Get back!

01:19:33.509 --> 01:19:36.697
Jack. Here.

01:19:37.541 --> 01:19:42.743
- Hey, hey, wait, wait, I don't know how to do this.
- Just throw.

01:19:42.754 --> 01:19:45.847
Thanks.

01:20:28.599 --> 01:20:31.857
Go save the Princess!

01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.382
Come on, let's go.

01:21:07.318 --> 01:21:10.340
Come on!

01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:21.741
Hurry.

01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:24.894
Come on, Jack.

01:21:24.905 --> 01:21:28.057
Watch out!

01:21:37.348 --> 01:21:40.535
It's time to go.

01:22:23.123 --> 01:22:25.446
Su lin.

01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:33.679
Su lin.

01:22:34.801 --> 01:22:40.988
- Su lin. Su lin..
- Jack..

01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:48.349
Are you okay? Hold on.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:18.517
- Almost there.
- But not quite.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.907
Why you doing this, son?

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:20.910
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grow man.

01:24:20.949 --> 01:24:26.092
Leave her alone and
I let you live.

01:24:26.163 --> 01:24:33.356
- You leave her alone, and I let you live.
- Let me think about it.

01:24:34.539 --> 01:24:37.655
No. I think I'll stay here.

01:24:37.667 --> 01:24:42.774
And I will take one leg.
Your other leg.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.928
Now take your arm.

01:24:47.955 --> 01:24:51.107
I'll just kill you.

01:25:31.715 --> 01:25:37.059
Jack! Jack! You're the shit.

01:25:37.136 --> 01:25:40.988
Thanks.

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:53.685
Hello, zhao.

01:27:53.728 --> 01:27:56.608
The empress request
your present.

01:27:56.613 --> 01:27:58.722
Okay, I'm just
waiting the wizard.

01:27:58.733 --> 01:28:01.956
Jack, if the empress summon
you, you must come at once.

01:28:01.966 --> 01:28:05.059
- He said he'll be right back.
- It is the rule.

01:28:05.094 --> 01:28:10.095
Or what, huh? Get
my head chop off?

01:28:13.366 --> 01:28:16.459
You guys and your rules, man.

01:28:16.494 --> 01:28:20.618
So I guess it's the
rules to smile.

01:28:26.817 --> 01:28:33.204
- Hi.
- Hi. Wow.

01:28:33.212 --> 01:28:35.262
What? Sure I'm not gonna
have my head chop off?

01:28:35.263 --> 01:28:40.406
- There's no one here to see.
- Okay.

01:28:42.388 --> 01:28:45.575
I wanted to see you
before you went back.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.729
Actually I wish I
could go with you.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.920
- Even for one day.
- You are the empress now.

01:28:49.965 --> 01:28:51.837
You can do whatever you want.

01:28:51.842 --> 01:28:54.093
Because I'm the empress I can't.

01:28:54.136 --> 01:28:58.022
Every minutes of everyday from
now on will be filled with.

01:28:58.063 --> 01:29:02.293
Ministers, ambassadors, and paper
to signing, decision to make.

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:06.534
- No dancing. No singing.
- No fun.

01:29:06.578 --> 01:29:10.678
I would love to go to the
mall to eat ice cream, but..

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.744
I.. I can't.

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:19.012
My father worked so hard to bring
peace to the whole country.

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:21.166
I can't let him down.

01:29:21.212 --> 01:29:25.206
He gave his life for our
people I owe it to him.

01:29:25.209 --> 01:29:28.396
I understand.

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:36.570
But I did want to thank you for giving me
memories that I will always treasured.

01:29:38.902 --> 01:29:43.026
I want to give one that
I hope you will, too.

01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:01.044
I don't think you're worthless.

01:30:01.915 --> 01:30:04.202
I never did.

01:30:04.209 --> 01:30:08.132
Goodbye, Jack.

01:30:28.227 --> 01:30:31.106
He touched the empress.

01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:34.298
He must to die!

01:30:45.813 --> 01:30:48.835
Hey.. Hey!

01:31:01.419 --> 01:31:05.413
Wizard! Wizard!

01:31:05.452 --> 01:31:07.774
- I'm here. Got it.
- I gotta go.

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.687
No I gotta go now.
I gotta go now.

01:31:09.727 --> 01:31:12.879
- Hey, I know. I put it somewhere.
- I gotta go.

01:31:12.923 --> 01:31:14.973
Here you see?

01:31:14.974 --> 01:31:16.112
Okay.

01:31:16.121 --> 01:31:19.143
- It's not ready yet? Come on, hurry!
- Relax.

01:31:19.145 --> 01:31:22.132
Jack!

01:31:28.495 --> 01:31:31.588
So after all we've been through?

01:31:31.623 --> 01:31:34.740
- You gotta kill me, really?
- Rules are rules.

01:31:34.752 --> 01:31:40.903
If we do not live by them, we'll
be nothing more than barbarians.

01:31:52.478 --> 01:31:56.471
Unless we can make an exception.

01:31:56.509 --> 01:32:01.675
- Sometimes good to be a little flexible, right?
- I hate you.

01:32:03.912 --> 01:32:06.898
Here.

01:32:08.014 --> 01:32:10.300
Thank you.

01:32:12.289 --> 01:32:15.406
Good bye, Jack Bronson.

01:32:15.521 --> 01:32:20.487
I will never forget you and
the lesson you taught me.

01:32:20.527 --> 01:32:21.735
It's done.

01:32:21.742 --> 01:32:25.629
The last missing piece to put.

01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:27.744
I might learned to be
flexible but they haven't.

01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:29.840
- Hurry up. Let's go.
- Yes.

01:32:29.841 --> 01:32:32.092
- Come on, man. Get it in.
- Let's go.

01:32:32.169 --> 01:32:36.163
- Go.. Go!
- Come on!

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.027
Jack?

01:32:58.029 --> 01:33:01.086
Hi, mom.

01:33:02.304 --> 01:33:06.404
What happened here?

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.427
It's complicated.

01:33:10.611 --> 01:33:13.597
I'm sure it is.

01:33:20.898 --> 01:33:22.036
Hello, dick-wad.

01:33:22.081 --> 01:33:24.060
Come on, Travis I'm gonna
be late for the class.

01:33:24.062 --> 01:33:28.364
You're gonna be late..
Permanently.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.333
- Okay, it's doesn't have to be this way.
- You're right. It doesn't.

01:33:32.368 --> 01:33:36.563
- You could.. Run.
- Yeah, nice.

01:33:36.574 --> 01:33:39.632
Pussy.

01:33:40.675 --> 01:33:42.785
Okay.

01:33:42.795 --> 01:33:45.853
I gave you the option.

01:33:46.897 --> 01:33:50.049
You gave me the option?

01:33:53.292 --> 01:33:55.437
What are you doing?

01:33:55.517 --> 01:33:58.361
What are you doing?
You wanna dance?

01:33:58.367 --> 01:33:59.540
Just give this over with.

01:33:59.584 --> 01:34:02.771
- Oh, man.
- Dick-wad.

01:34:03.859 --> 01:34:07.710
Asshole!

01:34:13.139 --> 01:34:17.133
- You're done?
- You're dead!

01:34:21.549 --> 01:34:24.571
Don't touch me!

01:34:24.609 --> 01:34:27.595
You had enough?

01:34:35.973 --> 01:34:38.189
- You alright?
- You alright, man?

01:34:38.233 --> 01:34:41.112
Yo, come on, man. Come on, man.

01:34:41.153 --> 01:34:44.210
- Come on, get up.
- Don't touch me!

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:46.462
Get up.

01:35:39.406 --> 01:35:43.600
Anvil center.

01:35:58.383 --> 01:36:01.297
What you doing?

01:36:02.345 --> 01:36:04.419
Sweetie, we have to move.

01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:08.733
I.. I can't make the payment.
We're losing the house.

01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.811
Or not.

01:36:16.908 --> 01:36:19.194
Um. It's a cheque?

01:36:19.202 --> 01:36:23.124
- Yeah.
- Its $25,000?

01:36:23.164 --> 01:36:24.206
Yeah.

01:36:24.242 --> 01:36:27.608
- It's made out to you?
- Yeah.

01:36:27.613 --> 01:36:29.628
I don't understand.

01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:31.679
Well, I, um..

01:36:31.714 --> 01:36:34.831
I came up the idea for
a game and I sold it.

01:36:34.842 --> 01:36:36.821
Oh, you're kidding.

01:36:36.859 --> 01:36:39.773
No.

01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:44.052
Oh, my god.

01:36:44.227 --> 01:36:47.379
I'm sorry. I have to sit down.

01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:50.305
A video game? What it is called?

01:36:50.344 --> 01:36:52.524
Uh, the warriors gate.

01:36:52.534 --> 01:36:55.520
What?

01:37:04.004 --> 01:37:10.083
Sulin wins.

01:37:29.933 --> 01:37:31.106
I'll have the chocolate
cone, please.

01:37:31.114 --> 01:37:38.237
Uh, I'll have chocolate, too and
vanilla and cherry and strawberry.

01:37:38.413 --> 01:37:41.364
Hi.

01:37:41.367 --> 01:37:43.441
- What.. What are you..

01:37:43.453 --> 01:37:47.553
I've made a new rule. Everyone
takes a vacation even the empress.

01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:49.734
Very modern, huh?

01:37:49.744 --> 01:37:51.794
- Wait, how did you.. Yeah.
- Get here?

01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:53.974
I had the wizard
making out a box.

01:37:53.984 --> 01:37:59.186
Oh, this is.. This
is so awesome.
