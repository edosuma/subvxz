WEBVTT

00:03.880 --> 00:07.110
<i>Tiger Echo Fist!</i>

00:07.860 --> 00:08.530
Bastard!

00:09.210 --> 00:11.590
There are too many for me to aggro!

00:11.940 --> 00:13.300
West Wind girl!

00:13.300 --> 00:15.820
How long until you can recast your AoE skill?

00:15.820 --> 00:18.700
I'm Kawara! And about twenty more seconds!

00:19.380 --> 00:20.470
What about you, Shigeru?

00:20.470 --> 00:22.120
Not much different.

00:22.470 --> 00:25.450
<i>For a PUG, our teamwork's not bad.</i>

00:25.840 --> 00:26.630
<i>But...</i>

00:27.170 --> 00:28.700
<i>There are just too many.</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:33.150
We need to hold out until the 
new kids reach the safe zone!

00:33.430 --> 00:36.970
Yeah, or we won't be able to face the master!

02:14.410 --> 02:16.130
They just keep coming...

02:16.130 --> 02:19.040
This is the sixth encounter. 
What the hell is going on?

02:19.480 --> 02:23.700
The encounter rate for goblins in 
this area shouldn't be this high.

02:30.250 --> 02:36.210
<b>Return of the Goblin King</b>

02:33.550 --> 02:35.280
Return of the Goblin King.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.900
Everyone's in quite a hurry, my lord.

02:46.070 --> 02:46.850
What?

02:47.270 --> 02:48.560
The goblins?

02:50.620 --> 02:53.860
An army of at least a few thousand goblins

02:53.860 --> 02:56.360
is on the move just beyond the next ridge.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.630
That many?

02:57.980 --> 03:00.200
Any news from the group at the coast?

03:00.580 --> 03:05.690
I can't reach Marielle or Shouryuu.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.270
That was stupid of me...

03:08.600 --> 03:11.860
I didn't add the rest to my Friend List.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.460
Nor did I.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.160
I can't reach the other members of 
the Black Sword Knights, either.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.130
This is bad...

03:19.700 --> 03:22.470
What did that goblin army look like?

03:23.230 --> 03:27.350
The ones I saw in the valley 
were a major raiding force.

03:28.270 --> 03:32.060
I've never seen an army that size.

03:33.180 --> 03:37.980
I also saw hobgoblins, trolls, 
and even demon beasts.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.330
They seemed to be heading west-southwest.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.830
I couldn't tell you any more.

03:44.270 --> 03:48.790
So the groups we fought 
must have been scouts, right?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.810
A huge army on the march...

03:53.320 --> 03:55.010
Over that mountain?

03:55.450 --> 04:00.270
We have the whole Crescent Moon 
Alliance on our Friend Lists...

04:00.660 --> 04:01.620
Don't we?

04:01.620 --> 04:02.440
Yeah.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.680
Can you contact them and ask what's happening?

04:06.270 --> 04:09.100
I'll let Shiro know first.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.000
All right.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.240
Keep me informed.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.730
Right, I'm on it!

04:17.480 --> 04:18.530
My lord?

04:20.140 --> 04:23.390
A mass of blue goblins from the coast?

04:24.110 --> 04:25.540
Sahuagin?

04:25.910 --> 04:28.490
Those monsters live farther south...

04:28.870 --> 04:30.000
What's going on?

04:30.380 --> 04:32.660
Maybe it's a coincidence?

04:32.660 --> 04:34.250
You think so?

04:34.250 --> 04:39.000
So all the adventurers at the coast 
are heading back to the school.

04:39.550 --> 04:42.380
What should we do, Naotsugu?

04:44.020 --> 04:48.340
If it comes down to it, we could all 
use a return spell to go back...

04:48.780 --> 04:53.390
If we do that, it'll take us several days 
to come back here, to Zantleaf.

04:53.830 --> 04:56.160
Then that's our last resort.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.820
Marie's in charge of the camp.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.310
We'll meet up with her.

05:04.670 --> 05:05.720
Here it is.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.570
Do it.

05:07.390 --> 05:11.360
Thank you for responding to 
my sudden call, everyone.

05:11.820 --> 05:15.100
This is Shiroe, of Log Horizon.

05:16.010 --> 05:20.020
As the Round Table members are 
currently separated from one another,

05:20.020 --> 05:24.000
I've taken the irregular step of 
convening a telepathic conference.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.290
I realize it's a bit bothersome,

05:26.290 --> 05:29.740
but I've designated one person in 
each of your locations to be a relay,

05:30.350 --> 05:33.290
so we can have this conversation in 
as near to real time as possible.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.850
In the future, I plan to 
further develop this network.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.580
First, to brief everyone on the situation...

05:41.050 --> 05:44.380
This morning, on the Zantleaf Peninsula,

05:44.380 --> 05:47.260
attacks by multiple races of 
demi-humans were confirmed.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.120
At the coasts, a minimum of 
several hundred sahuagin.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.620
In the forest, a huge raiding force 
primarily composed of goblins.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.880
There are at least

05:59.460 --> 06:00.880
ten thousand.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.280
Ten thousand?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.710
I believe there to be even more.

06:08.220 --> 06:11.220
Shiro, do you have any idea...

06:11.590 --> 06:14.350
...what the reason for this invasion is?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.980
I believe the driving force behind this invasion

06:17.560 --> 06:19.850
is the "Goblin King's Return."

06:20.360 --> 06:21.970
The "Goblin King's Return"?

06:22.690 --> 06:26.430
In the game, that event occurred regularly.

06:26.430 --> 06:27.110
Yes.

06:28.040 --> 06:33.240
The goblin castle, Seventh Fall, lies deep 
within the forests of the Ouu territory.

06:34.470 --> 06:38.810
Twice a year, the Goblin King is crowned there.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.380
Before that happens, players are 
given a week to slay him.

06:43.900 --> 06:48.010
If they defeat the king before the coronation, 
they can acquire rare items.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.460
Since these items were very powerful,

06:51.460 --> 06:54.630
and it was an easy event for regular players,

06:54.630 --> 06:56.830
it was one of the game's most popular events.

06:57.510 --> 07:03.520
The chief of the area's most powerful clan 
becomes the Goblin King.

07:04.040 --> 07:09.040
In other words, by attacking goblin 
bases around the Ouu area,

07:09.040 --> 07:14.030
you could weaken them, 
thus weakening the Goblin King.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.290
And that event had an element

07:16.290 --> 07:21.000
that was nearly forgotten because 
it almost never happened.

07:21.520 --> 07:26.480
As I recall, if you failed to defeat 
the Goblin King during that week,

07:26.480 --> 07:27.790
the king was crowned.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.830
This unified the surrounding clans,

07:29.830 --> 07:34.610
making the goblins several times more 
numerous than they'd previously been.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.310
Come to think of it...

07:37.650 --> 07:39.150
I remember that.

07:39.150 --> 07:39.930
Yeah.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.470
Then that's it...

07:41.470 --> 07:42.680
Since the Apocalypse,

07:42.680 --> 07:46.610
we've been so busy trying to make 
this world livable for ourselves...

07:47.170 --> 07:50.840
And we've been so preoccupied 
with raising our levels,

07:50.840 --> 07:54.450
we haven't taken any quests from 
the People of the Land.

07:54.990 --> 07:56.580
So this is the result...

07:57.120 --> 08:01.830
Does that mean the goblins are 
at their full strength, Shiro?

08:02.250 --> 08:05.710
We should assume the Goblin King, his guards,

08:06.100 --> 08:09.350
and his armies are stronger than 
we've ever seen them.

08:09.890 --> 08:15.740
My bigger concern is how large the 
six clans that were united are.

08:16.870 --> 08:18.840
The ones at the camp couldn't do it,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.130
but if the Akihabara adventurers banded together,

08:21.130 --> 08:22.500
we could wipe them out.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.730
The problem is the Eastal lords.

08:26.290 --> 08:29.440
Unfortunately, they aren't strong 
enough to handle them.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.360
As if I care!

08:31.860 --> 08:34.500
They haven't asked us for help.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.220
When this was a game, 
there was that overpowered army.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.950
Um, it was...

08:40.700 --> 08:42.210
The Knights of Izumo.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.390
Yeah...

08:45.670 --> 08:48.610
Heroes born from the People of the Land.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.960
Stronger even than adventurers...

08:51.960 --> 08:54.040
The ultimate weapon of the humanoid races.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.060
There are said to be thirteen bands 
of knights around the world.

08:57.060 --> 09:01.220
They've always been involved in battles 
that determined the world's fate.

09:01.610 --> 09:05.830
The Knights of Izumo are something like 
guardians of the Yamato Islands.

09:05.830 --> 09:07.730
We can rest easy, then.

09:08.070 --> 09:11.740
But as of now, no one is sure if they really exist.

09:12.140 --> 09:12.860
Eh?

09:13.180 --> 09:15.030
You get your news quickly.

09:15.580 --> 09:18.870
Either way, a large battle is unavoidable.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.120
At least some people will die.

09:22.460 --> 09:26.620
We can come back to life, 
but the People of the Land...

09:29.310 --> 09:30.280
My lord...

09:31.490 --> 09:33.460
Princess? Princess?

09:33.960 --> 09:35.630
Princess Lenessia?

09:36.790 --> 09:39.140
He's not here today, is he?

09:40.130 --> 09:41.640
Crusty.

09:41.940 --> 09:42.890
Why?

09:43.340 --> 09:46.030
Lately, you've been breakfasting 
together frequently.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.220
I would expect him to show up around this time...

09:53.310 --> 09:54.430
Father?

09:54.430 --> 09:56.490
Lenessia, remain calm and listen to me.

09:58.730 --> 10:01.900
A huge goblin army is approaching Maihama.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.200
Ten thousand of them.

10:03.510 --> 10:04.450
Ten thousand?

10:05.410 --> 10:09.170
In a few days, they're likely to 
number several times that.

10:09.490 --> 10:10.910
It's the worst disaster imaginable.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.420
There are thirty thousand people in Maihama.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.630
At most, there are two thousand guards!

10:17.360 --> 10:20.390
I'm returning to Maihama immediately.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.890
Then I'll go with you.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.060
No, you will remain in the palace.

10:25.060 --> 10:25.740
Huh?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.140
My father will, as well.

10:28.370 --> 10:29.650
Grandfather?

10:29.950 --> 10:33.080
This reaches beyond our city of Maihama.

10:33.870 --> 10:37.720
All the lords must come together 
at this conference.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.530
As high lord, my father has to 
remain here, at the palace.

10:42.860 --> 10:46.040
And you want me to help him?

10:46.570 --> 10:47.540
Yes.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.040
Father...

11:01.520 --> 11:03.470
Okay, everyone's here.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.950
Why don't we have curry tonight? Curry!

11:06.950 --> 11:07.880
Okay?

11:08.840 --> 11:09.780
Marie!

11:10.240 --> 11:11.160
Naotsugu...

11:11.160 --> 11:12.440
Marielle!

11:12.440 --> 11:14.610
Oh, Serara, you're safe.

11:15.220 --> 11:16.610
I'm so glad.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.950
You're still a little kid.

11:18.950 --> 11:20.070
But...

11:20.070 --> 11:22.580
I'm sorry, Naotsugu.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.120
For what happened...

11:25.360 --> 11:27.010
What are you talking about?

11:27.010 --> 11:29.120
It wasn't your fault.

11:29.470 --> 11:34.630
If anything, every adventurer is 
responsible for this disaster.

11:35.740 --> 11:36.930
Yeah, but...

11:37.890 --> 11:39.820
It isn't like you to overthink things.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.680
Leave it to Shiro. He'll handle it.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.790
He'll come up with a way out of this, 
even if it means cheating a little.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.440
She smiled.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.500
It's getting cold.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.840
You should change.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.290
That's right.

11:57.290 --> 11:59.320
Oh! Give me a second!

11:59.850 --> 12:01.070
Meow.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.460
I'm back!

12:12.370 --> 12:13.400
Put out the fire!

12:13.400 --> 12:14.350
What's happening?

12:14.350 --> 12:15.090
Over there.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.340
Torches...

12:23.480 --> 12:25.120
A goblin army?

12:25.120 --> 12:25.970
Yup.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.640
Someone, bring me a map!

12:30.640 --> 12:33.650
<b>Gobs                                     Fish</b>

12:34.120 --> 12:35.510
How does it look?

12:37.050 --> 12:39.710
This is a bit of a problem...

12:39.710 --> 12:40.400
What?

12:41.110 --> 12:45.800
Well, not so much for us, perhaps...

12:45.800 --> 12:47.120
You don't need to sugarcoat it.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.660
Out with it, Mr. Retiree.

12:49.090 --> 12:54.460
It looks like the goblins intend 
to attack the town of Choushi.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.710
<b>Fish</b>

12:58.000 --> 12:59.710
<b>Gobs</b>

13:00.140 --> 13:03.930
Of course, that isn't the giant 
army I saw this afternoon.

13:03.930 --> 13:06.600
It's a medium-sized division.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.020
The main force is way up north...

13:10.350 --> 13:11.970
Attack?

13:11.970 --> 13:14.230
That's a raiding force.

13:14.680 --> 13:18.730
In other words, they plan to take 
food from the town of Choushi.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.980
Choushi has no walls...

13:22.980 --> 13:23.990
You're right.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.790
If we leave them, they won't last until morning.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.490
We can't return to Akihabara 
without doing anything!

13:31.820 --> 13:33.840
We should go to Choushi.

13:34.790 --> 13:35.960
That's right.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.500
I don't know what we can do, 
but it's better than staying here.

13:39.710 --> 13:40.920
Don't be crazy!

13:41.300 --> 13:42.420
Isuzu?

13:42.770 --> 13:44.420
This isn't training...

13:44.420 --> 13:47.430
We don't even know how strong they are!

13:47.720 --> 13:50.070
I'm well aware of that, Miss Isuzu.

13:50.860 --> 13:54.430
But the people in the town don't 
even know the goblins are coming.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.320
You want us to do nothing, 
even knowing all this?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.820
Let's leave this stuff to the adults, okay?

14:05.820 --> 14:07.990
Are you saying we're kids?!

14:07.990 --> 14:09.470
That's not it...

14:09.470 --> 14:12.050
We've already grown plenty strong.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.890
Stop it, guys.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.540
I agree with Rundel Haus.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.000
Though, I don't think it's about 
how much stronger we are...

14:20.230 --> 14:21.570
Minori...

14:21.570 --> 14:24.760
Please let us go to Choushi!

14:28.550 --> 14:32.010
No matter how big their army is, 
their numbers don't pose much threat.

14:32.690 --> 14:35.840
With our fifteen hundred, 
we could destroy them.

14:35.840 --> 14:41.020
During that last conference, 
Isaac said that we haven't been asked to,

14:41.020 --> 14:42.780
so we have no reason to help...

14:43.430 --> 14:46.100
If he's going to do it, he needs a reason.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.490
That's true.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.530
Shiro didn't seem like himself, either...

14:52.860 --> 14:56.050
Normally, he'd make a quick decision.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.670
Just in case, I've asked Soujirou to join us here.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.240
If the palace is attacked, he'll help.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.920
All the representatives of the nobles are here.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.170
We can't leave it undefended.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.410
The West Wind Brigade is small but powerful.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.650
They won't alarm the nobles.

15:16.030 --> 15:17.180
That's a good choice.

15:17.490 --> 15:21.940
The nobles haven't said anything, though...

15:21.940 --> 15:25.440
I'm sure they're talking on their own.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.980
Without us?

15:27.980 --> 15:29.200
I don't like that!

15:29.510 --> 15:32.450
Then should we go to them, strategist?

15:33.300 --> 15:36.950
Before that, there's something 
I need to tell you all.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.200
What is it?

15:38.600 --> 15:41.460
It's about death in this world.

15:43.430 --> 15:45.880
If we die, we revive at the Cathedral.

15:46.430 --> 15:49.580
If we pay an EXP penalty, our bodies come back.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.530
That's how it was in <i>Elder Tale</i>,

15:52.530 --> 15:55.240
so we made the mistake of believing 
it would be the same here.

15:57.220 --> 15:58.980
From the information I've gained,

15:59.430 --> 16:03.470
death carries risks in this world.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.580
I'll spare you the details,

16:06.120 --> 16:09.490
but it seems that each death steals 
a small portion of your memories.

16:09.690 --> 16:10.490
What?!

16:10.640 --> 16:11.610
Our memories?

16:13.940 --> 16:16.060
How much do we lose?

16:16.480 --> 16:17.540
I don't know.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.520
Which memories do we lose?

16:19.520 --> 16:20.410
I don't know.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.010
What are you saying, then?!

16:22.010 --> 16:23.160
I don't know!

16:23.550 --> 16:24.920
Not yet, anyway.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.600
But judging from the hypotheses 
I've gathered, it seems to be true.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.020
I understand.

16:33.530 --> 16:37.930
So, that's why I'm missing some of my memories.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.530
I'm convinced.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.500
D.D.D. is a combat guild.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.320
Before the restoration of Akihabara,

16:46.320 --> 16:50.690
we underwent difficult combat training 
to adapt to this world's fighting.

16:51.290 --> 16:53.600
I died a few times, too.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.010
Normally, I wouldn't think about it,

16:56.010 --> 16:58.700
but it does seem that some memories were lost.

16:59.070 --> 17:00.200
Th-Then...

17:00.440 --> 17:01.830
That's horrible.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.180
Which memories, exactly?

17:04.660 --> 17:05.830
How many of them?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.950
I couldn't say for certain,

17:07.950 --> 17:12.090
but it seems most of them were 
memories of the world I came from.

17:14.360 --> 17:18.590
I've died twice since the Apocalypse.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.540
It's hard to say exactly which 
memories are missing.

17:23.150 --> 17:25.690
Because you forget that you forgot, you see.

17:26.460 --> 17:29.770
My memory is better than that of most,

17:29.770 --> 17:33.660
but I can't recall the name or appearance 
of the cat I'm sure I once had.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.700
This is likely due to my deaths.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.780
However, while I can only speak for myself,

17:38.780 --> 17:43.770
a few deaths don't seem to be enough 
to cause any real inconvenience.

17:44.180 --> 17:48.710
Even a few dozen would be unlikely 
to cause any difficulty in your life.

17:49.060 --> 17:53.980
But even so... You lose your memories 
of the old world, right?

17:53.980 --> 17:55.720
That's harsh.

17:56.020 --> 17:58.720
Well, it's not something to fret over.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.640
You simply need to avoid dying.

18:02.010 --> 18:05.490
And failing to act, for fear of the risk,

18:05.490 --> 18:08.350
is no different than a living death.

18:08.860 --> 18:10.480
No matter what world you're in.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.490
The risk is too great!

18:16.490 --> 18:18.570
What? Why?

18:18.570 --> 18:20.770
If you fear risk, how can you be an adventurer?

18:20.770 --> 18:22.490
Calm down, everyone.

18:22.770 --> 18:26.620
The lords' conference will hash out the details.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.020
Acting on our own right now isn't a good idea.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.000
Especially with the new kids here.

18:31.230 --> 18:35.330
This will affect relations between the 
adventurers and People of the Land

18:35.330 --> 18:37.860
for a long time to come.

18:37.860 --> 18:40.510
And we have no ostensible reason to save them.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.780
When you consider the big picture,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.950
acting based on emotion isn't wise.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.520
Yeah, that's about it.

18:48.050 --> 18:50.490
Enough of this. I'll go on my own.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.510
Wait! You can't go alone!

18:52.510 --> 18:53.270
But...

18:53.420 --> 18:55.410
We're a party, right?

18:56.580 --> 19:00.580
If we aren't all in this together, 
but we go, we'll just get hurt.

19:00.580 --> 19:02.280
Like we did at the start.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.370
But if something isn't done...

19:05.640 --> 19:09.760
Then, make us the advance party to Choushi.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.380
An advance party?

19:13.380 --> 19:15.800
A brilliant idea, Miss Minori.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.330
We can at least help them evacuate.

19:19.330 --> 19:23.650
No... Saying that was the only 
way to get them to agree.

19:24.140 --> 19:25.180
Which means...

19:25.590 --> 19:28.690
I think we should protect that city.

19:30.710 --> 19:31.440
Why?

19:31.940 --> 19:33.330
No one's asked us to.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.540
No one will reward us.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.340
It doesn't have anything to do with us.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.560
And I don't want to die.

19:38.230 --> 19:41.180
There are many reasons not to help them.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.320
But there isn't any reason we can't, right?

19:45.320 --> 19:46.690
That's true, but...

19:47.550 --> 19:48.440
Hey, look!

20:00.040 --> 20:01.460
No...

20:01.460 --> 20:02.430
We're too late?

20:02.670 --> 20:04.830
Goblins did this.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.030
Is anyone here?

20:26.050 --> 20:26.790
Tohya!

20:27.070 --> 20:29.250
I'll assist you, Mister Tohya!

20:29.770 --> 20:31.210
<i>Flash Needle!</i>

20:32.260 --> 20:33.790
<i>Head Splitter!</i>

20:39.660 --> 20:41.210
Do you need a reason?

20:41.760 --> 20:44.000
Is helping them without one wrong?

20:45.660 --> 20:48.740
If you want to help someone, isn't that enough?

20:49.860 --> 20:52.240
We're adventurers.

20:52.790 --> 20:53.610
That's right.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.520
If we run away, then I don't know 
why we became adventurers.

20:58.260 --> 21:02.320
We can't just boldly march home to 
Akihabara without saving the town.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.120
But how are we supposed to protect them?!

21:05.120 --> 21:07.870
That town has no walls, and there are so many!

21:08.040 --> 21:09.550
Fighting spirit.

21:09.550 --> 21:11.820
We're back to that again?

21:11.820 --> 21:13.410
Put some thought into it!

21:13.410 --> 21:15.420
I am thinking!

21:16.020 --> 21:17.670
There is a way.

21:18.650 --> 21:19.840
You're right.

21:19.840 --> 21:24.290
With our numbers, protecting Choushi 
from the goblins is impossible.

21:24.720 --> 21:30.560
And even if we could, it's pointless 
if other places are razed like this.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.140
That's why

21:33.070 --> 21:34.060
we don't protect them.

21:34.890 --> 21:37.400
M-Miss Minori, what do you mean?!

21:39.280 --> 21:41.630
Minori's right.

21:42.010 --> 21:48.910
We came to make sure you young kids 
weren't getting yourselves into trouble.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.330
Nyanta!

21:50.330 --> 21:51.410
Master Naotsugu!

21:51.890 --> 21:55.170
Um... Please give us permission.

21:55.930 --> 21:58.980
Adventurers are free. 
They don't need permission.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.990
If you've thought for yourself and 
reached your own decision,

22:01.990 --> 22:04.300
you have the freedom to 
see that decision through.

22:05.080 --> 22:09.820
However, Minori, it won't be easy.

22:09.820 --> 22:11.220
Chief! Master!

22:11.220 --> 22:13.840
It's a man's job to be quiet and let us go!

22:14.100 --> 22:16.280
Minori's had an idea!

22:16.990 --> 22:18.720
Understood.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.770
At least let us hear it first...

22:21.070 --> 22:23.420
Minori's idea.

22:23.420 --> 22:23.990
Sure.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.210
We drop the idea of protecting the town.

22:28.210 --> 22:30.440
Instead, we seize the initiative.

22:32.340 --> 22:34.280
We attack the goblins.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.660
Minori and the rest begin their 
battle against the goblin army.

24:09.050 --> 24:11.740
They have no reason but to protect others.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.300
That is the freedom of an adventurer.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.220
But freedom requires resolve.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.380
When a girl breaks out of her 
shell and makes her decision,

24:19.380 --> 24:21.440
her body will rise into the sky.

24:21.690 --> 24:29.990
<b>A Lazy, Cowardly Princess</b>

24:21.770 --> 24:24.060
Next time: A Lazy, Cowardly Princess.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.810
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
