How many sides of bacon did you eat?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.539
Seven or eight?

I don't know. Seven, eight, nine.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.082
I was fucking starving!

00:41.124 --> 00:42.918
You guys really should have invited me

00:44.712 --> 00:46.338
Why the fuck would we do that?

not to waste your hard-earned fucking

02:05.960 --> 02:08.503
Okay, first of all, hockey players

02:05.960 --> 02:08.503
are fucking weird.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.428
Like, nobody's that fucking good.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.014
Yes, they are, Ricky. Peter Forsberg's that good.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.224
He's a fucking legend. He's pretty good

02:21.266 --> 02:23.102
but the only reason I think he made it

02:21.266 --> 02:23.102
as far as he did

02:23.143 --> 02:24.937
is because he's so goddamn perfectly good looking.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.564
It's the only reason.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.190
Good looking?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.901
Well, that's what they say in the magazines.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.736
I don't know. Let's go get these

02:30.943 --> 02:32.736
meatballs in.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.321
Let's just sort this shit out.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.786
Ricky: What the fuck are

02:38.742 --> 02:40.786
these things, Bubs?

02:40.828 --> 02:43.538
Some kind of little berry that you have

02:40.828 --> 02:43.538
with your meatballs.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.958
(Imitating Swedish Chef Muppet)

02:46.000 --> 02:47.793

02:47.835 --> 02:49.503
The Swedish meatball guy.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.630
The Swedish Chef, from The Muppets.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.630

02:51.672 --> 02:53.090
Borschty, borschty, borschty!

02:53.132 --> 02:55.425
Kind of tastes like a little canberry.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.552
A what? A canberry.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.552
Canberry?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.220
Berries you get in a can.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.598
Julian & Bubbles: "Cranberry."

02:59.262 --> 03:01.598
There you go.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.351
Shit! Shit. (Chuckling)

03:04.392 --> 03:05.853
You know what? It's not that bad.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.896
I thought it would look like a lot more.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.732
That's quite a fucking... quite a load of

03:07.938 --> 03:10.732
meatballs there.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.151
Boys, this trip is fucked!

03:12.191 --> 03:13.652
In most places we haven't eaten at all

03:13.694 --> 03:15.821
and now we're eating too fucking much.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
Swearnet dicks! Start drilling

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
these things

03:17.698 --> 03:19.825
into your mouth, man. Stop complaining.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.201
Drilling what into your mouth, Julian?

03:22.243 --> 03:23.787
The balls? The balls, yes.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.622
(Cackling)

03:25.664 --> 03:27.708
Julian wants to start drilling balls

03:25.664 --> 03:27.708
into his mouth!

03:27.749 --> 03:29.710
I'm saying all of us have to drill the

03:27.749 --> 03:29.710
balls into our mouth.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.629
I didn't know you liked sucking

03:29.751 --> 03:32.629
on balls, Julian.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.131
Do you see me sucking on this thing?

03:34.173 --> 03:35.674
I'm eating it.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.844
Drilling it in your mouth.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.846
Bubs... What else you like

03:38.886 --> 03:40.846
drilling in there?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.890
(Chuckling) Fuck off.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.890
Do you lick them first

03:42.931 --> 03:45.266
before you put them in your mouth? Or...

03:42.931 --> 03:45.266
just right in? (Cackling)

03:45.308 --> 03:47.561
I think Europe's fantastic!

03:47.602 --> 03:49.563
They've got all these nice, sort of...

03:49.604 --> 03:53.734
old buildings and stone roads which I really enjoy.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.486
Very nice. Love Europe.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.989
Some of these buildings are 500-600 years old.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.866
Ricky: Fuck off!

03:59.031 --> 04:00.866
(Laughing)

04:00.908 --> 04:02.868
They are, Ricky. They are, Rick.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.327
Who fucking built them? Aliens?

04:04.369 --> 04:05.829
We haven't been around that long.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.206
Who hasn't been?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.456
Us.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.875
Humans?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.251
Ricky, humans have been around

04:11.292 --> 04:13.712
more than fucking 500, 600 years.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.839
Do they have evidence of that?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.839
Yes.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.217
Yes, they built these fucking buildings.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.052
Yeah, but we don't really know how

04:18.258 --> 04:20.052
old they are.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.012
They might say they're that old,

04:20.094 --> 04:22.012
but maybe they're not.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.098
(Sighing) Ricky, there's...

04:24.139 --> 04:26.100
Why would someone lie about that, Rick?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.851
Europe can basically lick my balls.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.520
"Oh, I'm so fucking fancy! Oh, I'm so old!

04:30.562 --> 04:32.313
"And I've got all these stony fucking roads,

04:32.355 --> 04:35.525
"and big, fancy, stony buildings, and old shit

04:32.355 --> 04:35.525
and paintings

04:35.567 --> 04:37.611
and all your stupid, dumb, fucking languages!"

04:37.652 --> 04:39.196
Fuck off, Europe!

04:39.238 --> 04:41.073
Maybe we just say fuck it.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.575
What? Fuck the meatballs.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.575
We can do the Viking ship,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.702
and I'm probably going to beat Forsberg anyway.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.702
Or hopefully.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.412
No, Ricky, this is easy.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.831
We're getting through them.

04:49.873 --> 04:53.877
What's 25 bucks if we're going to have

04:49.873 --> 04:53.877
a thousand bucks later?

04:53.919 --> 04:55.963
Well, in case we don't get the thousand,

04:56.004 --> 04:57.714
it would be nice to have this as a back-up.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.925
The more money we have, the better,

04:59.967 --> 05:03.678
so that tomorrow, if we fuck up,

04:59.967 --> 05:03.678
we'll have money.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.806
I'm telling you right now, there's no way he's scoring that

05:03.720 --> 05:05.806
many fucking goals on me.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.808
NHL or not NHL or fancy rich,

05:07.849 --> 05:09.726
or whatever the fuck he is, I don't care.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.726
Ricky,

05:09.768 --> 05:11.770
do you know the stats on him?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.770
No. I know he's good.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.772
I've seen him play.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.150
He's, like, number 6 or 7,

05:16.191 --> 05:18.902
all-time fucking points or something.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.862
It's like Gretzky, Gordie Howe,

05:20.904 --> 05:23.615
Mario Lemieux, Sidney Crosby,

05:23.657 --> 05:25.867
Forsberg. He's right in that.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.619
Yeah, but it's probably mostly assists.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.621
There's no fucking way he's going to score

05:29.663 --> 05:33.125
every goddamn shot on me.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.125
Well... Hopefully.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.043
We're going to eat these fucking balls

05:33.167 --> 05:35.043
until they're done.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.796
Long as I got some decent goalie gear.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.796
(Belching)

05:37.838 --> 05:40.215
Being forced to eat meatballs is fucked!

05:40.257 --> 05:42.425
I mean, especially when you're a picky

05:40.257 --> 05:42.425
eater like I am.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.761
But, if that's what I've got to do to get drunk tonight,

05:44.803 --> 05:46.345
I'm eating the fucking things.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.932
All right, who wants the last meatball?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.851
I've got my last meatball right here.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.020
So do I. Boys, I don't know

05:50.892 --> 05:53.020
if I can do this, man.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.438
I hear you. Come on, it's one more

05:53.061 --> 05:55.438
fucking meatball.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.899
Here, cheers. Come on, put them in, boys.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.194
Eat this meatball, go crush dessert,

05:57.941 --> 06:00.194
Cheers!

06:00.235 --> 06:02.321
Cheers! 25 bucks coming

06:00.235 --> 06:02.321
our way.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.241
Ohh...

06:06.283 --> 06:07.701
Here we go, gentlemen.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.244
The second round is ready.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.829
Second one? What the fuck is this?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.497
Yes, sir. The second round,

06:12.539 --> 06:13.915
and you have one more round.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.416
One more after this? Yes, sir.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.502
Enjoy your meal.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.547
Oh, my fuck!

06:20.588 --> 06:22.674
Boys!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.968
(Sigh) I can't do it, man.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.553
There's no way we can do this.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.263
We can. You know what? Let's just pretend.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.098
Just tell yourself we just sat down.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.018
We haven't already eaten 100.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.603
Just sat down. "Oh, man, am I ever hungry."

06:38.481 --> 06:41.568
Just shut up and eat the fucking meatballs.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.778
Eat 15 or 20 meatballs, they're pretty

06:41.609 --> 06:43.778
fucking delicious.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.780
But you start to eat 200, 300, 400 as a group,

06:45.822 --> 06:47.741
you realize, "Holy fuck, boys!

06:47.782 --> 06:49.576
We just ate a whole meat animal!"

06:49.617 --> 06:52.371
Fuck, boys, I don't think I've eaten 300 of anything

06:52.411 --> 06:54.081
ever in my life! God!

06:54.122 --> 06:56.166
I bet you we ate 10 pounds each.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.918
How the fuck are we going to eat dessert?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.503
Oh, I could eat fucking dessert no matter what.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.089
Where is this fucking place?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.174
He said it was right past the corner.

07:04.216 --> 07:08.262
"Gamla... Gamla Stans Fisk."

07:08.303 --> 07:09.888
Fiks-ks.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.432
Gamla Stans Fisk.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.310
Here's fisk... fiks-ks.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.310
Yeah.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.021
Imagine, this is what Randy feels every

07:15.352 --> 07:18.021
day of his life, man.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.940
Fuck, that'd be uncomfortable.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.940
This is it.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.025
This looks like a fish store.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.111
Well, it's Gamla Stans. Jesus, Bubs...

07:25.987 --> 07:28.115
Boys, this is a fish market.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.866
Well, they must have dessert here.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.327
They've got vegetables and bread, I see.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.788
How's it going? We're looking for

07:32.369 --> 07:34.788
a gamless man

07:34.829 --> 07:36.873
or a gamless ham? No, Ricky, we're

07:34.829 --> 07:36.873
in the store.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.127
We're looking for, um, a dessert called

07:36.915 --> 07:40.127
Surströmming?

07:40.168 --> 07:42.212
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm supposed to

07:40.168 --> 07:42.212
give you that.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.423
Thank you. Bubbles:

07:42.254 --> 07:44.423
It's like a strudel, is it, or...?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.259
No, no. It's canned.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.760
Just like this.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.054
Really nice. Traditional.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.224
This is a dessert? Should try it.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.934
It doesn't look like a fucking dessert.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.978
Why's it on ice in the middle of

07:55.976 --> 07:57.978
a bunch of fish?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.813
Boys, I fucking hate seafood.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.813
I can't...

07:59.854 --> 08:01.564
It's got water in it too. Let's get out of here.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.900
The smell is making me fucking want

08:01.606 --> 08:03.900
to throw up.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.652
Man: If you need a

08:03.942 --> 08:05.652
can opener...

08:05.693 --> 08:07.695
Yeah. Yes, okay.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.695
You can borrow that.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.781
It's a dessert though, or...?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.699
It's really nice.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.161
Something sounds fucking weird to me.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.703
Okay, let's try it.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.664
Well, at least it's a pretty small can,

08:17.705 --> 08:19.833
whatever the fuck it is. Yeah, I mean, the three

08:17.705 --> 08:19.833
of us can eat this.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.751
Boys, I've got a bad feeling about this.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.253
And even if it is fish,

08:23.295 --> 08:25.839
I'll bring the rest of it home for my kitties.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.633
You don't understand. I don't like seafood, Bubs.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.633
I can't fucking do this.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.345
How the fuck does this work?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.847
It's one of those old fashioned...

08:31.386 --> 08:33.847
Hook that on there...

08:33.888 --> 08:35.598
(Wincing)

08:35.640 --> 08:38.226
Jesus Murphy...

08:38.268 --> 08:41.229
Oh, yeah, she's got a... she's got

08:38.268 --> 08:41.229
a stink to her.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.523
Definitely got a stink to her.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.108
(Laughing) Jesus, Bubs.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.610
Are you okay, Bubs? Not really.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.196
You've got to hook this part in.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.824
I'm trying to hook it there.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.326
I think we should just give up, boys.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.286
Just... Let's not even bother.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.580
Jesus, Bubs.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.833
It doesn't smell that bad.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.377
I think we can eat this.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.755
(Retching)

09:07.797 --> 09:10.258
Don't you dare... Ricky! Ricky, don't...

09:10.300 --> 09:13.428
(Retching) Ricky, don't

09:10.300 --> 09:13.428
start puking.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.680
You're going to make me sick...

09:13.470 --> 09:15.680
Ricky! (Retch, cough)

09:15.722 --> 09:17.932
Stop that!

09:17.974 --> 09:19.600
It doesn't smell that bad. Smell it.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.811
(Gag) (Coughing)

09:19.642 --> 09:21.811
Bubs!

09:21.853 --> 09:24.189
What? It fucking stinks, bud.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.359
No! We can eat this.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.444
We can eat this, no problem.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.196
(Wheezing)

09:31.238 --> 09:33.573
Ricky! Would you smarten the fuck up?

09:33.614 --> 09:35.242
(Spitting)

09:35.283 --> 09:37.285
Yeah, she's pretty ripe...

09:37.327 --> 09:39.246
She's pretty ripe, actually.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.122
(Coughing)

09:41.164 --> 09:43.542
That was, hands up, the worst fucking smell

09:41.164 --> 09:43.542
I ever got smelled.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.960
It was like Satan's donkey took a shit into my ass

09:46.002 --> 09:48.380
and it came up and went out of my mouth

09:46.002 --> 09:48.380
and up my fucking nose.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.673
Bubbles: She's pretty ripe.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.134
Bubbles, we can't... (Retching)

09:53.176 --> 09:55.803
We can't do this, man.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.597
Julian: Ricky?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.057
I can't even go near it.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.850
It's awful! She is pretty ripe.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.477
You know, when I first cracked the can,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.187
all of a sudden it was like,

10:04.229 --> 10:06.898
I thought I smelled something, and then the wind hit.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.942
Jesus Murphy.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.278
It was like nothing I've ever...

10:11.319 --> 10:13.572
I don't know what the fuck goes through

10:11.319 --> 10:13.572
someone's head that says,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.323
"I'm going to put rotten fish in a can

10:15.365 --> 10:17.158
and eat the fucking stuff."

10:17.200 --> 10:20.120
Boys, I can't see where the fucking...

10:17.200 --> 10:20.120
(Groan)

10:20.161 --> 10:21.496
where the dang-dangs are.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.081
Here, can you get the last... ?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.541
Fuck, Bubs, I don't know.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.340
(Mixed groans) Oh, fuck!

10:32.382 --> 10:33.758
(Retch)

10:33.800 --> 10:36.261
Don't throw up on me, Rick.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.346
(Retching) Oh, Jesus!

10:38.388 --> 10:40.223
Look, there's flies buzzing around.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.682
Well, it's rotten fish,

10:41.724 --> 10:43.101
that's what it is.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.520
I can smell it.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.606
(Coughing) Julian:

10:45.562 --> 10:47.606
Jesus!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.818
Here, Julian, you just finish her off.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.487
I can't, Bubs.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.741
Boys, there's no fucking way I can eat that.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.619
It's fucking disgu... (Retching)

11:04.247 --> 11:06.374
Bubs, you've got it all fucked up, bud.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.374
Oh my God, boys.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.002
Well, I tried. I never used one of these

11:06.416 --> 11:09.002
can openers before.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.212
Let's just go to the Viking museum, boys.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.839
I can't fucking deal with the smell.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.176
Julian: Just a second.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.927
Bubbles: It's just

11:16.217 --> 11:17.927
rotten fish.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.930
Almost got it.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.933
(Groan) Fuck!

11:23.975 --> 11:25.435
It's fucking terrifying!

11:25.477 --> 11:27.562
Well, set your drink down.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.190
I'm not setting my fucking drink down!

11:27.604 --> 11:30.190
This fucking thing...

11:30.231 --> 11:32.484
Are you seriously going to eat this...

11:30.231 --> 11:32.484
(Wincing)

11:32.526 --> 11:34.110
(Gagging)

11:35.570 --> 11:38.281
(Retch) Ricky!

11:35.570 --> 11:38.281
(Laughing)

11:38.323 --> 11:40.283
Oh, she exploded on you.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.955
Ugh-h-h-h...

11:45.997 --> 11:48.416
(Retch) Fuck!

11:48.458 --> 11:52.128
(Retching, spitting)

11:57.925 --> 12:01.596
Julian: Bubs, we can't do this!

12:01.638 --> 12:03.557
How many of them do...

12:03.598 --> 12:05.642
(Mixed retching, coughing)

12:05.684 --> 12:07.644
(Lips smacking)

12:07.686 --> 12:10.063
How many do you think I've got to eat?

12:10.104 --> 12:11.565
To get the money?

12:11.606 --> 12:14.025
(Mixed retching)

12:19.030 --> 12:20.615
(Spitting) Boys...

12:22.576 --> 12:25.370
we've got... (Mixed retching)

12:25.412 --> 12:28.248
Julian: We've got to get away.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.917
Can't do it, Bubs. I can't either, boys.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.917
Shut her down.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.460
Call it. I'm getting out of here.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.463
Let's go... fuck this.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.257
That's not worth 25 bucks.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.634
Fucking Swearnet fucking bastards!

12:44.431 --> 12:46.057
If I had to do it again,

12:46.099 --> 12:48.017
I would rather fucking pucker up

12:48.059 --> 12:50.228
and put my lips right into Samsquamptch's hole.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.856
Oh, my God, that stuff was... (Groan)

12:53.898 --> 12:56.943
It was rancid. Can't even think about it.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.114
(Retching)

13:01.155 --> 13:02.865
I'm fucking worried about Ricky.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.367
I've never seen a human

13:04.409 --> 13:06.911
throw up that much stuff ever in my life.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.705
And, if he's going to stop Forsberg,

13:08.747 --> 13:10.624
he's got to be on the top of his game.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.334
Oh, those Swearnet dicks trying to make me

13:10.665 --> 13:13.334
puke on purpose

13:13.376 --> 13:15.169
so I couldn't play goal against Forsberg!

13:15.211 --> 13:16.795
Guess what? The joke's on theirs.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.590
I feel fucking fantastic!

13:18.632 --> 13:20.216
Boys, I've only got to make one fucking save.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.718
It can't be that hard.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.511
Ricky, he's a fucking legend.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.722
He's a Hall of Famer. It could be very hard.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.223
I know. He's good, he's good.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.725
But it was more assists. Not so many goals.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.935
But he's still a fucking wicked hockey player.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.063
Like, way better than anybody you've ever

13:30.977 --> 13:34.063
gone up against.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.232
Some of the guys I went up against in jail

13:34.105 --> 13:36.232
were pretty good.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.025
Oh, what? Donnie and Dougie?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.111
Oh, yeah, those guys are unbelievable.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.489
I got full confidence in Ricky. Stop fucking...

13:40.153 --> 13:42.489
What are you doing, Bubs?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.823
I'm just saying... (Talking over one another)

13:44.865 --> 13:46.576
Hey, how's it going? Good. How are

13:44.865 --> 13:46.576
you guys doing?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.827
Good. What's going on, man? Yeah, big fans.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.038
What are you doing here? We're here for

13:48.869 --> 13:51.038
the competition.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.831
Oh, you are? Okay. To watch?

13:52.873 --> 13:55.084
No. We're the guys. I'm the goalie.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.671
Okay, great. Someone told me it was going to be

13:55.126 --> 13:57.671
some athletes coming by,

13:57.712 --> 13:59.880
but... I guess it's you.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.091
What the fuck is that? That's not the gear,

13:59.922 --> 14:02.091
is it? Like, I...

14:02.133 --> 14:03.510
Peter: It is the gear, man.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.969
I need real gear!

14:05.011 --> 14:07.054
Swearnet's just fucking with us again.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.808
So we show up and there he is, Peter Forsberg,

14:09.848 --> 14:11.267
the man himself.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.145
You know, and he's just warming up and stuff.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.022
And then we see the shitty pile of gear there

14:16.063 --> 14:18.024
and I knew right away that Swearnet was fucking with us.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.234
Cocksuckers.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.362
Boys, I can't wear that.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.863
We'll be back in 5 minutes.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.323
Okay. For fuck's sakes.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.162
I could probably beat him naked, but a fair's a fair.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.039
I want real fucking goalie gear.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.124
Man: Wait, which one of you's

14:33.080 --> 14:35.124
going to be naked?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.795
Ricky: Hmm?

14:38.837 --> 14:42.006
You want to go have some meatballs?

14:38.837 --> 14:42.006
(Chuckling)

14:42.048 --> 14:44.091
Holy fuck, I never want to see

14:42.048 --> 14:44.091
another meatball...

14:44.133 --> 14:46.594
What the fuck does he have? Jesus Christ...

14:44.133 --> 14:46.594
(Thuds)

14:46.636 --> 14:48.888
Bubbles: What is he doing?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.890
Ricky, go... The other way!

14:50.931 --> 14:52.933
It's turn this way! The other way.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.854
(Annoyed sigh)

14:55.895 --> 14:57.980
Fucking asshole! What the fuck is

14:55.895 --> 14:57.980
your problem?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.899
Fucking just start turning!

14:59.940 --> 15:01.568
Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

15:01.609 --> 15:03.361
Fuck you, piece of shit!

15:01.609 --> 15:03.361
Come on!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.488
Ricky! Oh, my God.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.867
( ♪♪ )

15:08.908 --> 15:10.869
Right on, Bubs. Perfect.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.287
Okay, it's pretty... All right, man.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.287
You've got this,

15:13.329 --> 15:14.748
you've got this, Rick.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.374
Come on, Ricky. Show me your game face.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.876
(Growling)

15:17.917 --> 15:19.335
That's it. (Exhaling)

15:19.377 --> 15:20.545
(Soft thud)

15:21.962 --> 15:23.882

17:34.804 --> 17:37.015
He was definitely one of the best players I've

17:34.804 --> 17:37.015
ever played against.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.017
If I had my own gear I probably would have

17:37.056 --> 17:39.017
stopped three or four,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.310
but I only had to stop one and I did.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.022
I mean, the other problem was his fucking eyes are

18:09.672 --> 18:11.591
In Canada we have a tradition that,

18:11.632 --> 18:13.718
when you lose, you have to drink

18:11.632 --> 18:13.718

I'm not doing that. Not that cup.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.736
it has to be clean, I guess, or some fucking bullshit.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.153
We still get the 500, though, boys.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.822

Quite a goalie. And I don't think he was

18:41.328 --> 18:43.330
being sarcastic either.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.916
I think he meant it.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.460

18:49.128 --> 18:51.255

18:51.297 --> 18:52.840
I scored a couple. I felt bad in the end though,

18:52.882 --> 18:54.467
so I decided I would shoot one off the blocker

18:54.508 --> 18:55.927
