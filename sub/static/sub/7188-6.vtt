I CAN TELL YOU
TO TELL HIM.

11:49.608 --> 11:50.943

RETRIEVE THE SKULL

THE LIBRARY EARLIER,

14:32.471 --> 14:36.609

21:56.114 --> 21:58.116
AND I'VE GOT TO DREAM...

21:58.116 --> 21:59.318
SEE YOU TONIGHT?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.253
DEFINITELY.

22:08.160 --> 22:13.365
WHAT MADE THE HUNTSMAN
PICK THESE TWO YAHOOS

22:13.365 --> 22:14.566
AS HIS APPRENTICES?

22:14.566 --> 22:15.500
WAS IT THEIR COURAGE?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.369
AAH! DON'T LEAVE ME!

22:17.369 --> 22:18.437
THEIR CLEVER WITS?

22:18.437 --> 22:20.539
I KNOW YOU ARE,
BUT WHAT AM I?

22:20.539 --> 22:22.007
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.342
I SEE FROM YOUR RESUMES

22:23.342 --> 22:26.144
THAT YOU'VE SLAIN 3 DRAGONS,
A GIANT LEECH,

22:26.144 --> 22:28.013
AND A WHOLE PACK
OF MANTICORS.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.948
WELCOME ABOARD.

22:29.948 --> 22:34.619
UH, HE DOES KNOW
IT WAS ALL IN
A VIDEO GAME, RIGHT?

22:34.619 --> 22:36.588
MM, MM, MM, MM.

22:37.305 --> 22:43.222
