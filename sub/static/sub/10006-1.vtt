00:11.720 --> 00:15.472
Good morning. It's 6 a.m. on a
beautiful morning in Boston.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.932
These are the top stories:

00:17.100 --> 00:21.228
Mayor White's assistant has met
with the Redevelopment Authority...

00:21.438 --> 00:24.398
...over the controversy
on the Town Heights project.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.277
Saugus: Police have arrested
contractor James McManus...

00:28.486 --> 00:31.071
...on $23 million graft
and bribery charges...

00:31.281 --> 00:35.743
...in connection with the Mystic
River extension. Hyannis Port...

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:47.547 --> 00:50.507
Mrs. Levine is day five
post-cholecystectomy.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.636
She remains afebrile and her previous
anorexia is gone, draining well.

00:54.804 --> 00:58.182
An AP chest film is clear.
Her white count is nine-four.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.727
BUN has stabilized at 40.2,
good output of 1600cc's.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.937
- Blood cultures?
- No growth times two.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.524
Well, Harris can't nail us on this one.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.817
Next case.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.699
- It was a long time ago.
- And is he good?

01:15.909 --> 01:18.202
Yeah, he can really break it up!

01:18.411 --> 01:19.870
Billy's weird.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.663
He gets so tired.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.415
Do you like this lipstick?

01:23.708 --> 01:24.833
She was terrific.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.835
It's 32 now and going fast.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.629
He can't afford to get out.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.131
I got a thousand shares of that.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.428
We have to have the AP, lateral and
10 units done before they can begin.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.348
It says here, type and cross-match
was done yesterday.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.934
Just standard workup procedure.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.310
Well, I don't know.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.021
So it was a clear case of endocarditis.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.357
We're ready when you are, Dr. Wheeler.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.942
No response to antibiotics.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.531
Cut her, okay?

01:55.698 --> 01:58.117
- Sponge.
- Begin to tie off.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.250
It's all politics. Today, for instance...

02:06.459 --> 02:11.255
...Rudnick says to me, "I hear you're
the new chief resident in surgery."

02:11.464 --> 02:14.049
- That's great!
- He was testing me.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.343
Then he says that Harris told him...

02:16.553 --> 02:19.847
...that Mark Bellows was going to be
the next chief resident.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.224
- Wonderful, Mark.
- But here's the thing.

02:22.433 --> 02:26.478
He waited for me to say I knew
about it. That wouldn't look right.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.982
That would look as if I expected it.
So I said I hadn't heard anything.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.152
Heh. You've wanted it for two years.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.321
But there's no point
in saying that, is there?

02:36.531 --> 02:37.739
I said, uh...

02:37.907 --> 02:40.659
...I thought it'd be wonderful
if it happened.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.245
I said Chandler was doing
an excellent job as chief resident.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.457
But I said there was a little room
left for improvement.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.501
Chandler's damn good.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.921
I really laid it on thick
with old Rudnick.

02:53.089 --> 02:57.634
I told him I was following his hepatic
research, cited some references.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.511
He was impressed.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.930
Procedure went well too.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.600
So all in all, it was a good day.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.854
I'm gonna take a shower.
Can you grab me a beer before dinner?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.397
Hey, Mark.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.732
Get your own beer.

03:12.108 --> 03:15.235
- Honey, for chrissakes, come on.
- I want to take a shower.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.696
- I was on call last night.
- So was I.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.531
I know, but I had two arrests...

03:19.741 --> 03:22.868
...aortic aneurysm blew at 4 a.m.,
had to be done stat.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.871
So I didn't get any sleep,
and I'd really like to take a shower.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.043
If you don't mind.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.961
I had a hard day too.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.090
You get in the shower faster
than any person alive.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.551
Have a beer. You'll feel better.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.140
I know what'd make me feel better.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.392
Goddamn doctors.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.812
Couldn't have fallen
in love with a nurse.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.859
Dorothy on the eighth floor.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.487
She liked me.

04:00.782 --> 04:01.823
My own apartment.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.663
Did you hear about Louis?

04:07.872 --> 04:09.039
What about Louis?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.000
They passed him up
as assistant professor.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.504
Guy's really paid his dues too.
Now they don't take him.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.757
Plus his son is waiting
for a kidney transplant.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.841
Did you start dinner?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.428
What?

04:23.638 --> 04:24.805
Did you start dinner?

04:25.014 --> 04:29.685
- Did you hear anything I said?
- It's in the fridge. Just heat it up.

04:29.852 --> 04:34.106
- I was telling you about my day.
- I had a hard day too.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.733
Just go heat it up.

04:37.026 --> 04:40.821
Why is it, whenever we're about
to fight, you're always undressed?

04:41.030 --> 04:43.740
What's the big deal?
Just heat up the stew.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.743
- Why won't you help out?
- Is that the way you see it?

04:46.953 --> 04:49.705
I make my concessions.
You always take a shower first.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.500
- I don't.
- You do too, and I'm getting tired of it.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.296
- Honey, come on.
- Don't call me honey.

04:57.505 --> 05:01.091
I'm trying to tell you about my day.
Something that happened.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.760
Your days are always the same.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.431
What is that supposed to mean?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.558
Just politics, that's all.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.728
Who said what to whom.
Who's rising, who's falling.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.605
Who's made a good move, a bad move.
Politics!

05:15.815 --> 05:18.692
Somebody has to be interested
in hospital politics.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.027
You certainly are not.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.363
I thought you were a surgical
resident, not a political one.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.574
I like politics.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.952
They interest me. Just because
you're always looking for—

05:29.537 --> 05:31.705
You want me to heat up
the dinner, is that it?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.916
I want some respect.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.586
Susan, come on. Don't leave again.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.172
Why can't you share
half the responsibility?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.549
I share more than
half the responsibility!

05:42.759 --> 05:45.010
- No need to shout.
- Why are you running off?

05:45.219 --> 05:48.055
You think I want this?
Let me tell you something.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.766
I make concessions
for this so-called relationship.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.810
- I know it's hard on you politically.
- I also want you to—

06:00.818 --> 06:01.902
Susan, don't go.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.323
You know what the trouble with you is?

06:06.532 --> 06:08.950
All you care about
is being chief resident.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.704
You know what your trouble is?
You don't want a relationship.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.123
Look at you.
You run away from it.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.000
This is ridiculous.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.252
You don't want a lover...

06:19.462 --> 06:21.505
...you want a goddamn wife!

07:03.089 --> 07:04.548
Bastard.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.353
Hmm. I have a bleeder here.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.022
- I need more suction.
- Clamp.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.155
He's not di-toxic.
He has advanced ASHD.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.701
I just bought some at 43.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.371
Yeah, I hear they have management
problems. I sold at 37.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.836
- How are you?
- Mm-hm.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.046
I'm fine. The case went well.
No problem.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.590
Good.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.802
I'm really sorry about last night.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.554
So am I.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.432
- You want to have some lunch?
- I have class.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.477
You don't think this is
more important than the class?

07:58.686 --> 08:02.481
Mark, that class is the only time
I get out of this damn hospital.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.358
Can you understand that?
It's important to me!

08:06.068 --> 08:07.444
You're impossible!

08:07.653 --> 08:09.237
Seven, eight, step!

08:12.408 --> 08:14.242
Back. Step.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.578
Out!

08:18.664 --> 08:22.083
One, two, down three,
up four and open.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.462
And one and two,
three and four.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.214
Stretch.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.758
Walk two, three, four...

08:29.967 --> 08:33.470
...and five and six, seven,
eight and back.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.556
- You gonna leave Mark?
- I don't know.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.933
I went home last night.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.643
Again?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.812
He's impossible.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.732
Did you see Dr. Richards?

08:45.983 --> 08:48.527
- And?
- I don't know.

08:48.736 --> 08:53.031
Apparently you can tell by looking at
the cervix. It's a different color.

08:53.241 --> 08:57.202
He did the lab tests and he says
I'm definitely 8 to 10 weeks pregnant.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.747
So Dr. Richards is doing
a D and C tomorrow.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.543
- For menstrual irregularity.
- Mm-hm.

09:05.836 --> 09:06.878
It's simple, isn't it?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.047
Are you worried?

09:09.632 --> 09:13.426
I know you do this every day but, sure,
I'm worried. Who wouldn't be?

09:13.970 --> 09:17.055
It'll be fine, Nancy.
It's routine procedure.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.814
We're going to the Ice Capades.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.858
- It's real crowded.
- Patient on call?

09:29.068 --> 09:32.654
- Coming right down, Dr. Cowans.
- The instruments are autoclaved.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.532
Let's teach you fellas
some anesthesiology.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.325
This is your standard anesthesia.

09:37.535 --> 09:42.122
You've got two main wall lines.
Nitrous oxide on the left and oxygen.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.541
We got a case today that's a D and C.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.086
It's one of Dr. Richard's cases.
Actually, it's a TAB.

09:48.296 --> 09:52.716
That's a therapeutic abortion.
Keep it clean. It's a married patient.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.844
On the cart here,
we got two manometers...

09:56.012 --> 09:59.264
...with flow valves here and here
to regulate gas.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.808
We got emergency oxygen down here...

10:02.018 --> 10:04.519
...which we checked and that's full.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.315
During surgery, we'll be recording this
and the vital signs.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.649
Hey, how is Bess?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.109
I don't know.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.694
In and out.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.654
Yeah.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.657
Boy, she has more rails
than anybody I know.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.200
She's seeing a shrink now.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.119
One, two, three, up!

10:21.329 --> 10:23.538
- Anybody we know?
- Mm-mm.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.125
Morning, Nancy. Remember me?
I'm Dr. Cowans.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.044
Dr. Cowans.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.213
That's right, dear,
and you'll have a nice long sleep.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.717
Pre-op, she's received a 0.01
of Demerol and 0.4 of atropine...

10:35.885 --> 10:38.178
...so believe me,
she's pretty relaxed.

10:38.387 --> 10:42.932
I'll say she's relaxed!
Come on, Mrs. Greenly, on your back.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.434
That's it.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.312
- Gonna meet me for lunch?
- I don't know.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.065
- I'll let you know, okay?
- Okay.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.941
- I'll be in the lounge.
- Yeah.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.403
Henry might be calling,
and if he does, you know...

10:55.571 --> 10:58.448
- Okay, no problem.
- Yeah, okay.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.327
- Afternoon, Tom.
- Afternoon, Jim. How's our lady?

11:02.536 --> 11:05.080
- Just about ready.
- I'm still awake.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.582
- But not for long, dear.
- You promise?

11:07.792 --> 11:10.877
I'll induce with sodium Pentothal,
give an IV by syringe.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.629
Nance, what I want you to do...

11:12.838 --> 11:16.591
...is start counting from 100
backwards real slow, okay?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.718
Here we go.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.930
- A hundred.
- Ninety-nine...

11:22.723 --> 11:24.432
...ninety-eight...

11:25.434 --> 11:27.268
...ninety-seven...

11:28.145 --> 11:29.938
...ninety-six...

11:31.982 --> 11:34.109
It's quick. Stop the pentothal.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.611
You see, pentothal isn't
really an anesthetic.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.531
Any deep pain right now
and she'd wake right up.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.534
What we need for anesthesia is gas.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.120
First I'll inject some succinylcholine.

11:45.329 --> 11:49.374
I want you to watch her chest gauge
because she'll stop breathing.

11:53.003 --> 11:56.548
She's now experiencing
complete muscular paralysis.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.884
She's got three minutes
to breathe or she'll suffocate.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.928
So now we intubate.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.723
Taking a laryngoscope like so.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.850
Hold her head
in an extended position.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.603
Enter laterally, put up
the base of the tongue, up and out...

12:10.813 --> 12:12.355
...visualizing the trachea.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.941
There it is, fellas. Take a look.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.485
You see it?
It's right over there.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.864
Come on, guys!

12:21.073 --> 12:25.869
Take our tube and enter here. So.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.289
In the middle of surgery,
I'll switch over to the telothane.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.126
- Stirrups up?
- Yeah.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.337
How is John?

12:36.547 --> 12:40.175
His fever broke today.
He'll go back to school tomorrow.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.260
Now we can check
the pupillary reflexes.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.972
Though she's unconscious,
the pupils should react to light...

12:46.182 --> 12:48.558
...and let us know
that the old brain is okay.

12:48.768 --> 12:53.563
That's it. Anesthesia's the easiest job
in the world until something goes wrong.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.192
It's 99% boredom
and 1% scared-shitless panic...

12:57.443 --> 13:01.613
...which we try to avoid.
The patient's yours, Dr. Richards.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.531
If you move in behind me...

13:03.699 --> 13:06.868
...you'll see what I am going to do
for this young woman.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.077
Some music, please.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.709
Actually, what I'm going to do
is get her out of a hell of a mess.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.669
She's pregnant.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.255
She doesn't want her husband to know.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.550
It's none of my business.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.012
I'm just her surgeon.
I don't run her life.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.725
So in fact, our task is simplified...

13:30.935 --> 13:33.686
...when the uterus is
anteverted and anteflexed.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.816
This is a function of the muscular
attachments, of which there are five.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.067
You should know them.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.780
They're the broad ligaments,
the round and cardinal ligaments...

13:43.989 --> 13:47.367
...and the endopelvic fascia,
the uterosacral ligaments.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.994
Again, part of the endopelvic fascia.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.124
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.294
She just threw a PVC,
and her blood pressure's falling.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.713
I got 90 over 60.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.008
She's fully oxygenated.
Red as a cherry down here.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.344
Uh, how much longer you got?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.138
Just a couple of minutes.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.933
I don't like this.
Her blood pressure is still falling.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.103
Damn!

14:15.271 --> 14:19.023
We should stop. She may be getting
too much vagal stimulation.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.608
Jesus Christ.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.112
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. Nothing's the matter!

14:24.321 --> 14:26.531
Something's the matter.
She's going to arrest!

14:26.740 --> 14:27.782
I can't find anything!

14:44.800 --> 14:47.594
I get a 100 over 80.
Her pressure's climbing.

14:47.803 --> 14:51.472
Let's finish up. I'd like to get
this mother off the table.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.768
Sponge, please.

14:58.814 --> 15:02.233
One-twenty over 80 and climbing.
She's okay.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.739
- These tissues go to pathology.
- Can I start bringing her out?

15:07.948 --> 15:09.449
Yeah, bring her out, Jim.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.540
Okay, Mrs. Greenly,
it's time to wake up.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.334
Okay, Nancy?

15:19.501 --> 15:22.170
Mrs. Greenly? Wake up.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.340
Nance, can you give me
a cough, please?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.509
Nancy?

15:39.939 --> 15:44.233
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Her pupils are fixed and dilated.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.820
- What?
- The pupils, they're fixed.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.906
Dilated.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.120
Oh, my God!

15:56.997 --> 16:00.458
Pre-op diagnosis,
acute gastric ulceration.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.044
Post-op diagnosis, the same.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.172
Surgeon, Dr. Wilson.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.383
Anesthesia, general...

16:08.550 --> 16:11.594
- Where's Schwartz? Cholecystectomy?
- Bed three.

16:14.139 --> 16:18.059
- Mr. Schwartz, I'm Dr. Bellows.
- You don't got to talk so loud.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.435
- How you feel?
- Ehh.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.770
Just "eh"?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.564
You want to get on your side
for me, please?

16:23.774 --> 16:26.484
- On your side.
- Speak up, I can't hear you.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.237
What'd they give you
in that operating room?

16:29.446 --> 16:30.780
Do you have any pain?

16:30.990 --> 16:34.283
If I had any pain,
I would go see a doctor.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.245
Now you want to breathe
for me real easy?

16:38.872 --> 16:40.832
That's it. Slowly.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.750
She was given 4 milligrams narceine...

16:42.918 --> 16:45.211
...to rule out
idiosyncratic hyper susceptibility...

16:45.379 --> 16:46.796
- ...to pre-op narcotic...
- Easy!

16:47.006 --> 16:49.882
Two units without effect,
a few peripheral fasciculations.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.759
So it's not succinylcholine?

16:53.637 --> 16:56.222
Delayed return of consciousness
of cryptogenic origin.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.311
I see no reason not to transfer her
to the intensive care unit.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.814
Mr. Schwartz, you're gonna be fine.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.648
That's what you think!

17:09.528 --> 17:13.531
- A grim prognosis, to say the least.
- Rather tragic.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.575
Someone should notify Dr. George.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.077
He'll want to review
the anesthetic protocol.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.288
Right, he's been paged.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.540
Looks like
another anesthetic reaction.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.587
Page Dr. Bendix, 44432.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.796
Check.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.840
George is not here.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.218
No, Dr. Bendix. Bendix!

17:34.428 --> 17:37.096
Maybe he left the hospital.
Try his office.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.683
Could you page Dr. Wheeler, please?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.187
So you see, Jimmy,
your kidneys are sick.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.563
They don't work right.

17:45.773 --> 17:49.317
We need to take out the sick kidneys
and put in a new one.

17:49.485 --> 17:53.488
- Today?
- No, not today. We have to wait until...

17:53.655 --> 17:56.824
- ...there's a kidney we can put in.
- Tomorrow?

17:57.326 --> 18:00.369
I don't know when.
But it could be a while.

18:01.997 --> 18:05.291
Dr. Wheeler, call extension 3-5-6.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.461
You can have one of these.
Which color do you like?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.380
Purple.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.007
Take two.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.051
I like purple.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.637
I can see that.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.935
I like red too.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.063
Dr. Wheeler.

18:28.357 --> 18:36.697
Yes.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.533
Um—

18:38.700 --> 18:42.036
Excuse me, I have to go
to intensive care now.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.038
A nurse should be right in.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.625
Surgical ICU.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.218
What's her status?

18:57.511 --> 19:00.638
Greenly? Complete squash rot.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.515
She's a total Gomer.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.892
It's brain death.

19:17.739 --> 19:21.701
That patient was transferred
to the Jefferson Institute yesterday.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.906
How can this happen?

20:00.782 --> 20:02.074
All this...

20:10.417 --> 20:12.251
Did you do an EEG?

20:12.794 --> 20:13.836
Flat.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.380
Completely flat?

20:16.798 --> 20:18.507
Completely flat.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.968
Did you repeat it?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.678
No, not yet.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.224
What happened during the D and C?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.475
Nothing.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.353
It's an unremarkable case,
according to the notes.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.813
Transient PVCs late in the operation.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.690
Nothing else.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.192
She never woke up?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.486
No.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.989
I want to look at her chart.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.465
If it were my friend,
I don't know if I'd be that cool.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.179
The potassium was what?

21:05.555 --> 21:07.556
One-eight? Are you sure?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.558
It must be a mistake.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.853
Honey, I'm sorry.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.647
I know you two were really close.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.193
Susan?

21:22.698 --> 21:24.198
Well...

21:25.784 --> 21:28.661
There doesn't seem to be
anything unusual in the chart.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.331
Normal 28-year-old patient
in good health for a D and C...

21:32.541 --> 21:35.334
...underwent telothane anesthesia,
comes out in irreversible coma.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.128
Hey. Hey, Susan.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.339
It's well-documented
that telothane causes liver damage...

21:40.549 --> 21:43.968
...and severe side effects in
a small percentage of surgical cases.

21:44.177 --> 21:48.097
- That's just the risk of anesthesia.
- I know you're upset.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.391
I'm not upset.

21:51.518 --> 21:55.396
You think because I'm a woman,
I'm going to be upset. I'm fine, Mark.

21:56.231 --> 21:59.734
I want to understand the variables
as they apply to this patient.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.862
- I'm sure you agree that's indicated.
- "This patient"?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.865
Here we have an ordinary,
uninteresting case...

22:06.074 --> 22:10.703
...of surgical reaction to telothane
anesthesia in a healthy patient.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.748
As far as I can determine,
there are no unusual aspects...

22:13.915 --> 22:17.043
...except that the patient
was tissue-typed.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.461
Tissue-typed for D and C?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.630
There's got to be some mistake.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.634
Here it is. No name on the slip
and no billing number.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.094
The patient is stable.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.931
That's not the first time the lab
ran a test on the wrong patient.

22:34.978 --> 22:38.272
Let's go home.
I think you're tired.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.276
I think I'd better check
the tissue-typing lab.

22:43.653 --> 22:44.695
Why?

22:48.241 --> 22:51.619
Nancy's problem was not caused
by wrong lab tests.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.872
I know.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.124
Honey, you're grabbing at straws.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.835
Let's go have some dinner.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.088
- I'm not hungry.
- We'll check the lab later.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.299
Stop acting as if
there's something wrong with me...

23:05.467 --> 23:08.344
...or the way I'm thinking!
I'm checking the lab now.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.263
- They're closed.
- I won't just stand here!

23:11.640 --> 23:13.891
Susan, the lab is closed.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.143
It closed at 6:00.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.272
Is she all right?

23:21.775 --> 23:24.402
Yeah, she just, uh...

23:25.320 --> 23:27.196
She likes to do things
her own way.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.208
Who's that?

23:39.376 --> 23:41.419
- Dr. Wheeler.
- Uh, we're closed.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.920
We don't do any determinations...

23:44.297 --> 23:45.339
...after 6, doctor.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.341
I want to look at your requisition book.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.509
Ugh.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.804
What does it mean when there's
no name and number on the slip?

23:52.180 --> 23:53.472
There's...

23:54.015 --> 23:57.059
There's always
a name or a number, doctor.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.271
For example, Nancy Greenly.
You did tissue-typing...

24:00.480 --> 24:02.731
...but there's no physician name
and billing number.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.358
Let me see.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.823
Yes, you see, it's been
printed out by computer.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.783
That's hospital policy.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.996
See, uh, a certain number of these tests
are randomly ordered by computer...

24:17.247 --> 24:18.456
...as a quality check.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.666
We do the tests here,
they're sent out...

24:20.876 --> 24:22.751
...and done again by an outside lab.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.254
The computer ordered
this test on Greenly?

24:26.131 --> 24:28.090
Yeah, central computer.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.468
Why don't you just show me?

24:30.677 --> 24:32.011
- I can't.
- Why not?

24:32.387 --> 24:33.637
I'm not supposed to.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.347
It's really important.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.435
Anyway, that information
isn't coded.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.687
If it isn't coded,
I can't pull it out.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.731
I mean, who would want it?

24:43.899 --> 24:47.151
Well, let's say, um,
I wanted a list of all the patients...

24:47.360 --> 24:49.236
...who had tissue-typing
in the last month.

24:49.404 --> 24:50.529
Same thing. Not coded.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.532
Oh, what do you do?
What good is all this equipment?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.242
I thought you recorded information.

24:55.410 --> 24:59.747
We do, but the truth is, we install
these computers to bill patients.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.917
We code patient name and number,
medical or surgical...

25:03.084 --> 25:06.587
...admission diagnosis,
therapy and discharge diagnosis.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.589
Okay, wait a minute.

25:08.757 --> 25:12.092
Can you give me a list
of all surgical patients...

25:12.302 --> 25:14.470
...with discharge diagnoses of coma?

25:29.319 --> 25:31.320
Okay, we have...

25:31.530 --> 25:34.281
...one general category
under "coma"...

25:34.658 --> 25:37.910
...and nine subcategories
under "brain syndromes."

25:38.078 --> 25:39.119
Good.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.164
I want a list
of all surgical patients...

25:42.374 --> 25:45.376
...with general category
of coma in the past year.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.378
Phew.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.629
You're sure you want it?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.267
I had no idea.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.185
It's a big hospital.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.813
Are you married or what?

26:08.233 --> 26:09.733
Thank you.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.550
Surgical ICU. That's right.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.582
Where'd you get this?

27:08.543 --> 27:11.920
It's against the law.
It's illegal to tap a data bank.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.464
I don't see why.
I'm a doctor.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.258
- I've got research—
- That's not the point!

27:16.468 --> 27:19.887
Every officer got the lecture.
No access without authorization.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.889
- They can throw you out.
- Never mind that.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.558
- What do you mean "never mind"?
- Mark.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.310
Look at this.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.228
Two hundred and forty names.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.732
Ten are young people
admitted for minor procedures.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.693
Breast biopsy, appendectomy.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.905
They all come out in a coma.
Aren't you surprised?

27:38.531 --> 27:42.409
The risk of surgical anesthesia
is six per 100,000.

27:42.577 --> 27:46.163
In a hospital this size, 10 patients
in a year is not surprising.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.290
So what are you doing?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.835
You missed your rounds.
You didn't scrub in at the gastrectomy.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.379
I had to do something.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.005
Why don't you do your job?

27:57.175 --> 27:58.926
Surgical ICU.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.553
Mr. Murphy is a 35-year-old
in good health...

28:01.763 --> 28:05.057
...admitted for a meniscectomy.
He's scheduled for this morning.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.434
Promises, promises.
They keep telling me...

28:07.644 --> 28:09.436
...there's a delay, another half-hour.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.897
Well, the suspense
is really killing me.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.108
I thought you doctors
liked to operate.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.777
- We'll get to you.
- Oh, I'd hate to be left out.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.404
How did you get your injury?

28:18.822 --> 28:20.114
Playing touch football.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.783
You know, with the guys,
horsing around.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.161
Dr. Wheeler, see Dr. Harris.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.080
See Dr. Harris in his office.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.457
The chief of surgery himself.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.960
Playing touch football, huh?

28:33.169 --> 28:37.131
Yeah. So I come in,
and all that happens—

28:40.844 --> 28:42.469
Thanks very much, Herb.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.513
We'll get together on it later.

28:45.807 --> 28:46.807
Would you come in?

28:50.979 --> 28:52.271
Excuse me.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.034
Sit down, Sue.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.001
Yes.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.170
Dr. Harris, it's Senator Brooke's office.

29:16.379 --> 29:19.089
He wonders if you can
change the meeting to 4.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.258
Yes, 4 is fine. Notify Henry.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.718
Yes, sir.

29:27.515 --> 29:28.932
Sue.

29:31.352 --> 29:35.773
I like to think that Boston Memorial
is the best hospital in the city...

29:35.982 --> 29:37.775
...perhaps in the country.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.194
I'm committed to it...

29:40.570 --> 29:43.697
...to the house staff we have here,
and to you.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.532
I think you know that.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.827
But we have certain constraints
imposed on us.

29:49.370 --> 29:54.124
One is the state law concerning
privacy in computer data access.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.211
An unauthorized entry was made
last night.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.047
We put the young man on probation.

30:02.050 --> 30:06.220
But he told us he made
the illegal entry on your behalf.

30:06.387 --> 30:07.429
That's true, sir.

30:07.722 --> 30:11.558
All the discharge diagnoses
of coma over a 12-month period?

30:11.768 --> 30:15.395
- I wanted it because I had an idea—
- Well, forgive me.

30:15.688 --> 30:19.233
But it isn't a question
of why you wanted it...

30:19.526 --> 30:21.235
...it's how you got it.

30:22.070 --> 30:25.572
I understand you have personal reasons
for being under stress...

30:25.782 --> 30:28.325
...for not acting as carefully
as you might.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.871
And I'm sympathetic to the way
you must feel about the, uh...

30:33.456 --> 30:35.249
...uh, Greely case.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.167
Greenly. Nancy Greenly.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.379
Greenly. Yes, Nancy Greenly case.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.885
I certainly don't want to lose
a good surgical resident.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.599
Well...

30:53.101 --> 30:55.602
I think we can handle this, Sue.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.730
I'll keep the, uh, evidence...

30:59.357 --> 31:02.067
...and we'll forget
it ever happened, all right?

31:05.196 --> 31:07.948
But I'd like you to see someone.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.325
I was thinking of Dick Morelind.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.203
Dr. Harris, I'm fine.
I don't need a shrink.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.830
No, no, I know you don't.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.417
But it's important to have
on record a talk with Dick Morelind.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.419
- I don't see why.
- Actually...

31:20.628 --> 31:24.131
...it's a precondition to
your continuing on here at Memorial.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.550
Okay?

31:28.303 --> 31:29.344
I understand.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.472
I think it's unfair.
Everybody's on my back.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.601
Mark's whining about
how I can't make a commitment...

31:35.810 --> 31:38.103
...and I'm cold,
and I'm afraid of intimacy.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.147
Then this happens to Nancy...

31:40.315 --> 31:43.150
...and she's my best friend
since boarding school.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.986
Everyone jumps on my back,
acts like I'm neurotic...

31:46.195 --> 31:48.155
...and I'm not doing my job!

31:48.740 --> 31:50.490
There's concern about
breaking the law.

31:50.783 --> 31:53.368
I wanted to do something.
Do you understand?

31:53.578 --> 31:55.287
Do something right away.

31:55.496 --> 31:58.874
I just couldn't sit there
and watch Nancy and...

31:59.500 --> 32:01.501
How do you feel about
what happened?

32:04.797 --> 32:06.131
Confused...

32:06.549 --> 32:07.841
...that's all.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.843
Just confused.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.803
It's very...

32:12.013 --> 32:13.639
...confusing.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.643
I wanted to understand
what happened to her.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.520
Nobody else here seems to care.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.148
- Nobody else cares?
- Listen.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.110
There have been 10 cases
of unexplained coma...

32:27.320 --> 32:30.864
...in young, healthy patients
in the last year.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.200
- Now, don't you find that surprising?
- No.

32:35.703 --> 32:36.912
You don't.

32:37.747 --> 32:42.167
Susan, this hospital does
30,000 operations a year.

32:42.377 --> 32:46.880
I'm not surprised a few turn out
with serious unexplained side effects.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.799
Medicine isn't perfect.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.133
We all accept that.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.594
Don't we?

32:54.389 --> 32:56.390
There's a crisis
in her personal life.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.684
- She's involved with a resident.
- I know.

32:58.893 --> 33:01.228
It's led her to overreact
to this situation...

33:01.396 --> 33:03.689
...which she has not
consciously faced.

33:03.898 --> 33:06.358
She's under stress
and a little paranoid.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.861
Mm. Think we'll have
any more trouble with her?

33:10.071 --> 33:11.571
I don't think so.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.156
I hope you're right.

33:13.449 --> 33:16.618
I hate to admit it. I think I was
really upset about Nancy.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.120
Yeah.

33:18.287 --> 33:19.871
- You on call tonight?
- Mm-hm.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.248
So am I.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.166
Why don't we have
a terrific dinner...

33:23.376 --> 33:25.794
...just the two of us
in the hospital cafeteria?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.713
- Sounds great!
- About 11?

33:27.922 --> 33:28.964
You got a date.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.299
Maybe afterwards,
we can go to our favorite room...

33:31.467 --> 33:33.010
- ...on the eighth floor.
- Mm.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.095
Nobody will be there after midnight.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.973
I think we're looking at cortical anoxia.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.267
- I'll check the Babinski.
- How old is he?

33:40.476 --> 33:41.560
Thirty-five.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.062
When did you administer
the additional dosage?

33:44.272 --> 33:47.774
At the onset of cardiac irritability.
The surgeon said he was light.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.028
Surgeons know nothing about
anesthesia. What'd you give?

33:51.237 --> 33:52.320
Two cc's push.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.698
There was no reason
there'd be a problem.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.908
Just seemed a little light.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.286
Some PVC in runs,
transient hypotension...

33:59.495 --> 34:01.329
...but no sign of hypoxia.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.708
Skin color and blood
were all red and fully oxygenated.

34:05.084 --> 34:08.545
The pupils are fixed and dilated,
I must presume brain death.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.630
Any relation to your other case?

34:10.797 --> 34:14.926
Completely different. Different staffs,
different anesthetic agents.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.304
- He better be trached.
- Do we need a pulmonary consult?

34:18.514 --> 34:21.641
Request the consult,
but go ahead with the tracheotomy.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.143
This is a long-term
management problem.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.188
- Come on.
- It happened again.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.983
That's Dr. George, chief of anesthesia.
He's got it under control.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.070
Is there a research protocol
this case would fit?

34:33.279 --> 34:36.197
He's a good research case.
Excellent teaching material.

34:36.407 --> 34:39.034
It's true, Mr. Murphy
presents challenges...

34:39.243 --> 34:41.786
...electrolyte balance IV,
caloric maintenance...

34:41.996 --> 34:44.371
...possible pseudomonas infection.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.085
There may be additional
risk of staph osteomyelitis.

34:48.293 --> 34:51.963
But I think you'll be
agreeably surprised, Dr. George.

34:52.172 --> 34:54.216
We can keep him alive...

34:54.675 --> 34:57.677
...in stable vital signs, a year...

34:57.845 --> 35:00.472
...two years, indefinitely.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.682
You can't just look the other way.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.643
Nobody's looking the other way.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.021
Mark, twice in two days.
It's not normal.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.108
- In certain cases, patients always—
- You told me that.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.193
Two in two days.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.320
You're just sensitized to it.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.990
It just happened to a friend
and now you're looking for it.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.702
Twice in two days
is just our lousy luck.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.204
Hmm.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.164
- Did Harris take the readout?
- Yes.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.041
All right, then forget it.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.460
The hospital has
review boards and committees.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.087
They'll look into it.

35:32.296 --> 35:35.632
Now, you got a job to do,
so forget about this.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.889
You're right. You're right.

35:45.601 --> 35:46.643
I'll see you at dinner?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.520
Mm-hm.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.365
Dr. Williams, Dr. Peter Williams, 1174.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.251
This is Dr. Wheeler.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.840
I know about the conference
but I'm tied up with a patient now.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.594
Well, I'm afraid I can't
make it there in time.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.263
Where am I?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.974
I'm in the emergency ward.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.226
Yes, it is important.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.728
Will you hold on?

36:30.396 --> 36:33.398
Well, that's funny,
but all these charts you wanted...

36:33.608 --> 36:37.360
...they're all signed out to Dr. George,
the chief of anesthesiology.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.572
Good afternoon, Dr. George.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.741
Good afternoon, staff.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.203
We have a happy lab here.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.955
It's precise.
There's nothing left to chance.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.124
There are no mistakes.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.252
The charts are right here.
There's no mystery.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.463
They're right here.
What is it you wanted?

36:56.631 --> 36:58.340
I'd like to look at them.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.300
For what reason?

37:00.468 --> 37:03.845
I'm interested in unexplained coma
following routine surgery.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.597
- You're interested?
- Yes.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.141
Young lady, I'm more than interested.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.810
My anesthesiology staff
is more than interested.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.604
We're deeply, intensely concerned.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.191
- I understand your feelings.
- I'm not sure you do.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.319
Perhaps something was missed?

37:19.654 --> 37:20.946
Missed?

37:21.614 --> 37:24.199
Every professor of anesthesia,
most of our staff...

37:24.408 --> 37:27.160
...more than 40 experts
have gone over these charts.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.537
You think something was missed?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.915
But if anything
links them together—

37:32.124 --> 37:33.959
If anything linked them,
we'd know it.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.878
Here they are, 10 cases.
There are now 12.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.966
Different ages and sexes.
Different surgeons and anesthetists.

37:41.175 --> 37:43.176
Different methods of induction.

37:43.344 --> 37:48.181
They share nothing in common except
they all emerged with unexplained coma.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.892
We're certainly not neglecting
that problem.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.353
I didn't say you were.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.480
Do you mind if I have a look?

37:58.150 --> 38:00.193
I'm afraid I do mind.

38:07.743 --> 38:10.245
Thank you for your interest,
however misplaced, Dr. Wheeler.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.538
Good afternoon.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.221
Oh, my God, you did—
How could you do that?

38:29.765 --> 38:31.224
Susan...

38:31.392 --> 38:33.310
Dr. George is a past president...

38:33.519 --> 38:35.979
...of the American Society
of Anesthesiologists.

38:36.188 --> 38:39.566
He's a member of the AAAS.
He's on the board of the NIH...

38:39.775 --> 38:41.526
...and you tell him
he's doing his job wrong.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.322
- I just wanted to see the charts.
- That's not your area.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.533
That's not your responsibility.
You're way off base.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.120
You know who his wife is?

38:52.371 --> 38:54.664
- I don't care.
- Well, you should.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.917
His wife is Amy Cabot.
She's related to Godfrey Lowell.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.794
I don't care about Boston society.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.338
Dr. George's wife...

39:01.547 --> 39:05.633
...is worth somewhere between
50 and 100 million dollars.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.927
When she dies,
that money will go somewhere.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.346
So what?

39:09.805 --> 39:13.141
So he has a lot of muscle here.
He's the wrong man to cross.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.602
You afraid to be seen with me?

39:18.606 --> 39:21.274
- Come in.
- Hi, Bill.

39:21.442 --> 39:22.609
- How are you, Mark?
- Good.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.111
Sit down.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.117
You know, Mark...

39:31.285 --> 39:35.497
...I always thought that you'd have
this job when I leave next year.

39:35.706 --> 39:36.915
Everybody thinks so.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.125
You're the logical choice.
You're a good surgeon.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.795
You're well-organized.
You run a good service.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.005
Well, thank you very much, Bill.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.217
I'd hate to see anything
stand in your way.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.968
You know what I mean.

39:50.137 --> 39:52.138
She has the chiefs of service
in an uproar.

39:52.348 --> 39:55.725
- She's under a lot of pressure.
- And so are we.

39:56.227 --> 40:00.146
They're talking about releasing her
from her position here at the Mem.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.649
But nobody really wants
that kind of...

40:02.858 --> 40:05.652
...adverse publicity, that commotion.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.278
Of course not.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.739
You have influence with her?

40:11.617 --> 40:13.201
I don't know. She's paranoid.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.037
She thinks there's a conspiracy.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.082
George keeping the charts
from her did not help.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.751
Does she think, uh, you're involved?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.673
No. No, I don't think so.

40:27.508 --> 40:31.845
Let's hope not, Mark. What happens
to Susan may depend on you.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.139
I understand that, Bill.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.933
You know, a good chief resident...

40:37.143 --> 40:40.603
...handles problems
like this every day.

40:41.313 --> 40:45.233
I think if you're able to exert
some influence over her...

40:45.651 --> 40:47.318
...people would be appreciative.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.530
Well, I'll try.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.158
Good man.

41:10.926 --> 41:11.968
Where's Greenly?

41:12.178 --> 41:16.264
That coma case? She was to be
transferred to the Jefferson Institute.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.682
I guess she went there.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.059
Liz, did Greenly go to Jefferson?

41:20.269 --> 41:22.645
No, she arrested at 6 this morning.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.023
- She's down in pathology.
- In pathology?

41:25.274 --> 41:27.233
Yeah, they're probably doing
the autopsy now.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.778
Surgical ICU.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.780
There's a wrinkled appearance.

41:32.948 --> 41:35.575
The interior edge of the organ
can be bent without tearing...

41:35.743 --> 41:38.203
...as evidence of its structure.

41:38.370 --> 41:41.706
The gross appearance is consistent
with acute yellow necrosis of the liver.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.918
Presumably secondary to
fatal viral hepatitis.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.045
Do you have a patient
named Greenly?

41:47.254 --> 41:50.840
I don't know. Check in there.
I can't keep track of names.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.595
In microscopic section,
we may expect evidence...

41:55.763 --> 41:57.931
...of fatty degeneration
in necrotic cells...

41:58.140 --> 42:00.808
...with polymorphs and histiocytes
around them.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.023
Okay, incise the kidney there.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.691
Looks normal.

42:09.026 --> 42:11.444
- Okay, remove it.
- Greenly?

42:11.654 --> 42:14.030
This is Howard.
Greenly's over there.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.537
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Sue.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.497
What brings you here?
Interested in this case?

42:22.790 --> 42:24.999
- That's right.
- Hell of a puzzler.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.793
Young girl, good health...

42:27.002 --> 42:30.380
...in for a therapeutic AB,
comes out comatose.

42:30.839 --> 42:34.092
- Found anything?
- Naturally, we started with the brain.

42:34.301 --> 42:37.845
Grossly, it was normal.
I'm doing a section. Want to see?

42:38.472 --> 42:41.766
Ordinarily, these coma cases
get shipped to Jefferson.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.060
- What's Jefferson?
- Jefferson Institute.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.813
A chronic-care facility.
Government thing.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.898
They take care of the vegetables.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.485
Sometimes they die before
they get there, like this one.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.696
More work for us.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.240
Huh.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.075
Now we'll get an idea.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.997
We're looking for anything.
Micro-infarcts, staph loci...

43:05.249 --> 43:08.543
...gross hemorrhagic areas,
congenital defects...

43:09.253 --> 43:12.505
Nothing. Just like the
other cases, we come up cold.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.132
I know it sounds silly...

43:14.300 --> 43:18.553
...but, um, if you wanted to put people
in a coma, what would you do?

43:19.013 --> 43:21.806
- On purpose?
- Diethyl para-amino tannadol.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.683
No, it leaves a serum trace.

43:23.892 --> 43:26.352
- If you look for it.
- It also peaks alk phos.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.896
A real giveaway.
Besides, who can get tannadol?

43:29.106 --> 43:31.316
- Use paradine.
- It has a taste.

43:31.775 --> 43:35.445
We'd make great murderers.
Who knows more than a pathologist?

43:35.613 --> 43:37.447
Heh. It keeps my wife in line.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.658
Hell of a lot of crimes
slip through our fingers.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.703
But in this case, a coma.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.289
First rule of crime:

43:47.333 --> 43:48.833
Keep it simple.

43:49.335 --> 43:50.877
What's simple?

43:51.420 --> 43:53.713
- Carbon monoxide.
- Boring.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.717
- Carbon monoxide?
- Sure, it's perfect.

43:57.885 --> 44:01.095
Anesthetist uses carbon monoxide
instead of oxygen.

44:01.305 --> 44:05.433
It's colorless and makes the blood red
so the surgeon doesn't notice.

44:05.643 --> 44:10.355
But the brain dies from lack of oxygen.
The patient doesn't wake up.

44:10.522 --> 44:12.940
- No other effects?
- Sure other effects.

44:13.108 --> 44:15.234
- Cardiac irritability.
- Which this case had.

44:15.569 --> 44:18.780
It'd be better to block
the neuro-muscular junction...

44:18.989 --> 44:20.865
...with succinylcholine.
That's a nice murder.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.494
- Who's gonna do it?
- Who'll feed your carbon monoxide?

44:24.870 --> 44:25.995
That's the problem.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.665
Been 12 coma cases
here in the last year.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.249
They're always different.

44:30.459 --> 44:34.087
Different case, different anesthetist,
different operation.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.422
Hard to imagine it's murder.

44:37.257 --> 44:38.341
Are you sure?

44:38.926 --> 44:43.721
What do you think? There's a conspiracy
at the Boston Memorial Hospital...

44:43.931 --> 44:45.556
...involving all the anesthetists?

44:47.059 --> 44:51.437
I've had a rather hysterical call
from Dr. George in anesthesiology.

44:51.647 --> 44:56.025
Dr. George is a powerful person here,
not only because of his position.

44:56.235 --> 44:59.153
- There are other reasons.
- I gather.

45:00.656 --> 45:01.698
What does that mean?

45:02.116 --> 45:04.534
Just because somebody has a rich wife,
he shouldn't be able...

45:04.702 --> 45:06.869
- ...to throw his weight around.
- Oh.

45:07.037 --> 45:09.247
You're looking for
truth and justice, huh?

45:09.623 --> 45:10.957
I'm looking for fairness.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.836
In fairness, you've challenged
the professional competence...

45:15.045 --> 45:17.171
...of a chief of service
at this hospital.

45:17.381 --> 45:20.258
And he didn't take it well.
No reason he should.

45:20.467 --> 45:23.177
- Now he's out for blood.
- I've noticed.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.556
Sue, believe me, I'm on your side...

45:26.765 --> 45:28.725
...for all kinds of reasons.

45:29.101 --> 45:32.186
I don't want to let
another chief of service...

45:32.396 --> 45:34.772
...get one of
my house officers fired.

45:35.065 --> 45:38.234
Dr. Harris, I just wanted
to look at his charts.

45:38.736 --> 45:41.279
Sue, right now, I can protect you...

45:41.488 --> 45:45.032
...because you're good.
And frankly, because you're a woman.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.659
I don't want concessions.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.996
At the moment, you'd better
take any you can get.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.840
You know what happened to Greenly?

46:02.092 --> 46:03.342
Yes.

46:04.803 --> 46:05.928
What happened?

46:08.515 --> 46:09.932
She died.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.311
How do you feel about that?

46:14.521 --> 46:15.813
How do I feel?

46:16.857 --> 46:18.149
I feel...

46:20.277 --> 46:22.361
She was my best friend.

46:24.865 --> 46:30.328
She understood me.

46:42.966 --> 46:44.550
It's not fair.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.886
None of this is fair.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.056
Here.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.393
Nobody understands.

46:54.603 --> 46:56.771
- No one.
- I know, I know.

47:01.735 --> 47:02.777
Yes.

47:02.945 --> 47:07.406
Dr. Harris, the secretary of HEW
is on the phone from Washington.

47:07.574 --> 47:08.616
Call back.

47:17.751 --> 47:20.962
Too many of us shut ourselves off
from our feelings.

47:21.171 --> 47:23.172
We don't explore them.

47:23.632 --> 47:25.716
We don't understand them.

47:25.926 --> 47:28.427
We don't understand ourselves.

47:29.263 --> 47:32.306
It's the toughest thing
about our profession.

47:32.975 --> 47:35.601
- Dr. Harris—
- I'll take care of the politics.

47:35.769 --> 47:38.104
You just look out for yourself.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.524
Take the weekend off, Sue.

47:42.067 --> 47:45.111
Go walk on the beach.
Get away from the hospital.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.782
- I'm so embarrassed by this.
- No.

47:49.992 --> 47:52.285
Don't be. Don't be.

47:52.995 --> 47:55.830
Our emotions are what make us human.

47:57.124 --> 47:58.499
Come on.

47:59.918 --> 48:01.627
Come and see me next week, all right?

48:01.962 --> 48:03.462
- Right.
- Good.

48:05.549 --> 48:08.301
- Have a good weekend.
- Thank you, sir.

48:20.022 --> 48:21.063
Women!

48:22.357 --> 48:23.482
Christ!

48:54.097 --> 48:55.181
God!

49:57.244 --> 49:59.328
Just say you don't believe me.

49:59.913 --> 50:02.999
A man fixed your car
so it wouldn't start...

50:03.208 --> 50:05.418
...then followed you
into the MTA station.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.378
Well, it's true.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.924
They're gonna wave him in.

50:13.301 --> 50:15.469
Your car is always breaking down.

50:15.887 --> 50:17.763
I just think you're tired.

50:18.432 --> 50:21.767
- I'm not tired.
- Why don't we go away for the weekend?

50:22.019 --> 50:26.522
Go up the coast, have some fun
and just forget the hospital.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.607
Mark...

50:28.817 --> 50:31.610
There are 12 coma cases.

50:31.945 --> 50:35.614
Nobody thinks they're linked,
but I've seen charts for two of them:

50:36.366 --> 50:38.951
Nancy, and now this new guy, Murphy.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.411
And?

50:41.246 --> 50:42.913
And both occurred in O.R. 8.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.082
O.R. 8?

50:46.960 --> 50:48.586
What if...?

50:50.047 --> 50:53.674
What if carbon monoxide
were being pumped in O.R. 8?

50:53.884 --> 50:55.718
What if that were true?

51:02.350 --> 51:04.226
- Get your coat on.
- Why?

51:05.395 --> 51:07.188
We're going to take a look.

51:07.481 --> 51:10.149
Right now. O.R. 8.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.322
Well?

51:18.075 --> 51:19.492
Well...

51:24.664 --> 51:26.332
Looks okay.

51:30.253 --> 51:33.380
- How many operations you done in here?
- A lot.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.675
- You ever had any problems?
- No.

51:37.552 --> 51:39.095
Well, I already checked.

51:40.347 --> 51:45.184
The day Nancy had her problem,
there were five other operations.

51:46.394 --> 51:49.021
Four before and one after.

51:49.606 --> 51:53.150
The day Sean Murphy had his,
there were six others.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.152
Two before...

51:55.362 --> 51:56.862
...and four after.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.032
They were all normal.

52:06.456 --> 52:08.165
Let's get out of here.

52:32.524 --> 52:34.984
This is what you call
really working for it.

52:41.825 --> 52:42.992
No fair.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.453
Fair.

54:19.172 --> 54:21.340
I thought we were
taking the weekend off?

54:21.549 --> 54:24.593
Come on. Just a quick look.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.470
Please?

54:27.514 --> 54:28.806
For me?

54:31.268 --> 54:32.893
I don't know.

55:22.485 --> 55:24.862
There doesn't seem
to be anybody around.

55:25.405 --> 55:28.073
- You want to go in?
- Not really, no.

55:28.533 --> 55:29.616
I do.

56:40.188 --> 56:41.230
Can I help you?

56:41.564 --> 56:43.232
I'm Dr. Wheeler.

56:43.942 --> 56:46.902
- You're early, aren't you, doctor?
- Early?

56:47.737 --> 56:51.281
You're supposed to come on Tuesday,
day after tomorrow...

56:51.491 --> 56:52.866
...when the tour is scheduled.

56:53.827 --> 56:57.496
- The tour?
- Yes, it's every Tuesday at 11.

56:57.747 --> 56:59.456
The regular tour for physicians.

57:01.209 --> 57:03.293
Could I, uh, see it now?

57:04.379 --> 57:06.213
I'm afraid that's impossible.

57:07.215 --> 57:09.091
I just thought
as long as I'm here...

57:09.884 --> 57:11.468
We're simply not set up for it.

57:13.471 --> 57:15.597
May I speak with
the senior physician in charge?

57:16.808 --> 57:18.809
There is no physician in charge.

57:19.018 --> 57:21.019
Well, then, your supervisor.

57:21.187 --> 57:23.272
I have no supervisor.

57:23.773 --> 57:27.025
- Who runs the staff?
- There is no staff.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.611
You're here alone?

57:30.029 --> 57:33.699
Of course not. There are
technicians, security people...

57:34.492 --> 57:38.912
I'm sure when you've taken the tour
Tuesday, it will all be clear to you.

57:39.539 --> 57:41.498
What did you say your name was?

57:41.833 --> 57:44.209
Dr. Wheeler. Susan Wheeler.

57:44.752 --> 57:48.839
We look forward to seeing you
at 11 on Tuesday. Goodbye.

58:36.221 --> 58:39.056
I heard what you said
to Dr. George...

58:39.265 --> 58:40.807
...in the lab.

58:42.393 --> 58:44.394
I heard what you said to him.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.104
You're right.

58:47.023 --> 58:48.398
Right about what?

58:49.776 --> 58:51.902
I've seen how they do it.

58:54.614 --> 58:56.949
I know how it works.

58:57.534 --> 59:00.285
- How what works?
- Susan. Uh...

59:01.079 --> 59:04.957
Do you want to, uh, scrub in
on an aortic valve replacement?

59:05.124 --> 59:07.417
Harvey's doing one in room 16
in 10 minutes.

59:07.585 --> 59:08.627
- Sure.
- Great!

59:08.795 --> 59:12.089
Tom was going to scrub in,
but, uh, his case is running late.

59:15.301 --> 59:16.885
- I checked them out.
- Mm-hm.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.972
You come down to maintenance
tonight. I'll show it to you.

59:20.139 --> 59:21.181
Hello, Sue.

59:22.141 --> 59:23.725
Good morning, sir.

59:24.018 --> 59:26.728
- Did you have a good weekend?
- Yes, I did. Thank you.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:02.639
Evening.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.850
Good evening.

01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:13.859
You just gonna stare at me?

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:16.361
No.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.868
What'd you do that for?

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.245
They said make it look
like an accident.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.767
- What's happening?
- Emergency generator will kick in.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:51.563
Kelly?

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.525
Kelly?

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:23.970
What do you got now?

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:25.597
Nothing.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.433
Try the connector cable.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.895
I think that does it for me.
You got anything else?

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.980
No, I don't need anything else.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.442
- If we need you again—
- You can reach me at the hospital.

01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:41.613
Must be a short in the junction box...

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.699
...or the step-down panel.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.160
It should read 14 point something.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.287
14.3.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:52.332
Okay, now we should have 11.9.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.334
Eleven-nine.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.628
And now there's—

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:58.839
Fourteen-three.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.550
Good. Nothing's shorted so far.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:03.635
We got lucky.

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:05.303
Poor Kelly.

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:07.597
Poor Kelly? Heh.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.058
He got sloppy.

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:12.644
You know what it is?
That drinking at lunch.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:15.480
I said, "Stop drinking.
You'll get into trouble."

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.757
Two and two's the count.

01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:54.134
Can't get much more than that.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.016
- What did you leave in here?
- Just some charts.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.685
I'll call Dr. George
and tell him I let you in.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.478
It's all right.
I have to call him anyway.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.273
Well, okay.

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:11.276
- Boston ahead by one.
- That's great.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.987
I've got 20 bucks on this game.

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:00.033
What is it?

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.619
Hospital security, doctor.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.715
- What's the score?
- Just a routine check, doctor.

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:26.643
Easy, kids.

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:51.876
Jerry?

01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:55.587
- What's going on?
- Jerry, I'm so happy to see you.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.883
That's the nicest thing
anybody's said to me all day.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.176
Is something wrong?

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:04.389
You see, there's this guy.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.890
- He said he was hospital security.
- Yeah.

01:09:07.059 --> 01:09:10.645
Well, I happen to know that he—

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.607
It's a high fly ball and...

01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:16.901
...he's out!

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:20.404
- You were saying?
- I guess I have an overactive imagination.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:24.908
Heh. Be like me. Everybody says
I have no imagination at all.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:29.913
I'm going over to
the medical school library.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.832
I'll go with you.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:40.633
The tubular filtration gradient may be
more than 500 milliequivalents.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:44.429
That means there's an active
transport with phosphorylated ATP.

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:49.767
But if you trace radioisotopes,
densities don't look right.

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.812
It's a breakthrough
in understanding the kidney.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.733
Remember that yellow cadaver
skin under your fingernails?

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.610
Nobody could eat lunch.

01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:00.778
It seems like a long time ago.

01:10:00.988 --> 01:10:03.573
Back in the days
when we couldn't eat lunch.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.994
Wouldn't you know?

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:13.124
Dr. Marcus.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.335
Yes.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.545
Well, if he's complaining of pain.

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:20.548
Try another five cc's I.M.

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:26.012
I see.
Well, then, uh, MS 10 milligrams.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.934
Yes, morphine sulphate.
He's not in respiratory difficulty.

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:35.730
You can put him on
respiratory arrest with morphine.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.399
Particularly if he's on wall O-2.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.030
You'll have to check
and see what he's on.

01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:49.327
Air is fine, but oxygen...

01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:54.582
If he's on wall oxygen,
tell me how many liters of flow.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:58.336
Six liters!
You can't put him on MS.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.838
You'll have to stay with Talwin.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:06.511
Give him five cc's of water.
Say it's morphine.

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:09.097
He won't know.
He's a pain in the ass anyway.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.364
Aah! Unh!

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:40.678
Agh!

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.307
Mark, it's so awful!
It's so terrible.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.684
Take it easy.
Honey, slow down.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:49.687
He was trying to kill me.
And I had to keep going.

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:53.274
- And all the bodies. It's horrible!
- Easy. Easy, honey.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:54.775
Take it easy. Slow down.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:58.154
Mark, it's all happening.
It's really happening.

01:16:58.363 --> 01:17:01.699
Somebody's putting people into comas.
They're murdering them.

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:05.202
- I know, I know.
- No, no, really.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:09.540
Kelly's dead. I was down there.
I found the gas line.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:14.211
It starts in the basement
and it goes up the main tunnel...

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:18.674
...then plugs into the oxygen line
in the ceiling that goes to O.R. 8.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.760
- Honey, slow down.
- They're killing people...

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:23.179
...with carbon monoxide in O.R. 8.

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:27.642
- They have a radio to turn the valve.
- I believe you. I do, I believe you.

01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:29.727
All the cases happened in O.R. 8.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:33.356
And they all went
to the Jefferson Institute.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:39.695
And this guy, he chased me all over.
And there were so many bodies.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.281
It's all right. It's okay.

01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:45.451
And this is real. Call the police.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:49.455
We have to do something!
This is real, Mark.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.791
- Shh, shh.
- I can prove it.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.876
Sure, you can. You can.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.920
- Just lie down.
- This is real.

01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:58.589
I know you can.
Now one thing at a time.

01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:01.258
- I want to give you a Valium and—
- No.

01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:02.927
Okay.

01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:06.055
How about a cup of tea
to settle you down?

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:08.099
- A cup of hot tea?
- Okay.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.602
Then we're gonna talk
after you settle down.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.688
- Okay.
- All right.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.941
So you just rest right here. Okay?

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.944
You just stay right here
on the bed?

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.863
Thattagirl. That's it. You just relax.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:27.952
- I can't—
- That's it. Just relax. Close your eyes.

01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:32.206
That's it. Okay, thattagirl.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:36.544
- Now, I'll get you a cup of tea.
- You're so great, Mark.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.338
Stay here, honey. Just stay right here.

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:51.142
That's a hell of a story, Susan.

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:55.229
You really had
a lot of people worried.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.526
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay now.

01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:17.543
She came back. Yeah.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.920
No, she's here now.

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:24.049
Of course. No, I can manage that.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:26.761
I'll keep her here.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:29.513
Look, I'd better go.

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:35.352
Susan, you want some
honey with your tea?

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:39.607
Susan?

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.069
Su—?

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:03.172
Susan!

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:45.756
Memorial Hospital residents' exchange.

01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:48.592
This is Dr. Wheeler.
Are there any messages for me?

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:52.346
Oh, yes, doctor.
Quite a few. Just a minute, please.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.727
I'm sorry.
I'll have to call you back.

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:01.188
What number can you be reached at?

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:08.487
Dr. Wheeler, are you there?
What number can we reach you at?

01:21:11.449 --> 01:21:13.909
We are dealing in an
area of uncertainty.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.621
An area where there are no rules,
contradictory laws...

01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:21.625
...and no clear social consensus
as to what should be done.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:26.046
And the cost of care for the chronic
patient has become prohibitive.

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:30.467
This is particularly the case
with the long-term comatose patient.

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:35.139
The Jefferson Institute is a government—
sponsored experimental facility...

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:39.518
...designed to provide quality
life support to the comatose patient.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:41.604
I wish to emphasize...

01:21:41.813 --> 01:21:45.399
...no moral or ethical position
is being taken here.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:49.695
We do not participate in the debate
over whether these patients...

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.071
...are alive or dead...

01:21:51.656 --> 01:21:54.992
...or whether their care should
be continued or terminated.

01:21:55.201 --> 01:21:59.330
Society will decide if there will
be more of these facilities or not.

01:21:59.956 --> 01:22:04.835
In the meantime, we merely provide
care as inexpensively as possible.

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:07.504
Now, if you will
please come this way...

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.132
This is our visiting room...

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:13.510
...where relatives can see patients
who are stored here.

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:15.679
You see, it all looks quite normal.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.182
We've found it is inadvisable...

01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:22.603
...for relatives to know the actual
circumstances of patient care.

01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:25.856
It's too much of a shock.
So we bring the patient here.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:29.610
After the visit, we return them
to the main care facility.

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:33.155
If you will put on your glasses,
we'll go there now.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:36.575
This is our main care facility.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.703
Temperature here is
94.7 degrees Fahrenheit...

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:42.122
...humidity 82 percent.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:45.376
This stability reduces
patient heat loss...

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.586
...and caloric requirements.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:51.924
There's a low-level ultraviolet
bacteriostatic flux...

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.884
...and to prevent bedsores...

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:57.221
...patients are suspended
by wires through long bones.

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:01.183
- How do you get to them up there?
- There's no need for contact.

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:05.229
Every one of our patients is
individually monitored by the computer.

01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:09.650
Indwelling telemetry records weight,
fluid balance...

01:23:09.859 --> 01:23:13.612
...blood pressure, blood gases,
temperature, metabolic balance.

01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:18.575
Our computer makes an immediate
adjustment for any change in condition.

01:23:18.743 --> 01:23:19.952
For example...

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:25.582
...we simulate hypotension by direct
compression of the telemetry unit.

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:29.670
The computer will sense this
and make an immediate adjustment.

01:23:35.218 --> 01:23:37.386
Well, almost immediate.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.807
Sometimes there's a—

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:43.976
There we are.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:47.438
Sometimes there is a short delay,
but as you can see...

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:50.441
...the computer put the patient
in the Trendelenburg position...

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:52.943
...and administered a vasoconstrictor.

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:57.489
We have very few crises here.
With the assistance of technology...

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.284
...these patients
are maintained beautifully.

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:03.704
Without it,
they would have died long ago.

01:24:03.913 --> 01:24:08.000
But the law says they must be
maintained, and this is one solution.

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:10.502
How large is your staff?

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.629
One nurse, a physician on call...

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:16.425
...two computer technicians and
a small security staff. That's all.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:18.010
And the rest of the building?

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:21.722
It's of no interest. Just mechanical
and technical facilities.

01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:26.268
- What's the cost?
- For each patient, about $60 a day.

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:31.190
But we can store 1,000 patients
and then the cost will go down.

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:35.486
We expect to maintain patients
for about $5 a day.

01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:39.073
Less than it costs to hire
a baby-sitter for a few hours.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.408
If there are
no further questions...

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:44.912
...this concludes our tour
of the Jefferson Institute.

01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:48.665
Before you go, we have some literature
we'd like you to take.

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:52.878
It explains some of the background
and details of our work here.

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.089
We hope the tour has
been informative.

01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:59.176
And if you have any questions
about the Jefferson Institute...

01:24:59.385 --> 01:25:01.011
...don't hesitate to call.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.721
It shouldn't be about money.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.933
Maybe your patients don't
complain about their bills.

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:07.684
Thank you for your interest.

01:25:07.852 --> 01:25:08.977
Goodbye.

01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:18.338
Do you know what I wanted?

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:20.757
I wanted corned beef on rye...

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:24.511
...or else a roast beef with Russian.
And what do you bring me?

01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:26.180
Ham and cheese.

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:28.223
Well, that's all they had.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.894
You mean to tell me they didn't have
any corned beef? No corned beef?

01:26:32.103 --> 01:26:33.854
That's what the man said.

01:26:34.063 --> 01:26:37.524
No corned beef. The guy must
have been putting you on.

01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:44.698
George says we're having an electrical
inspection tomorrow morning.

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:46.450
Are we set for that?

01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:47.868
Norman!

01:26:48.077 --> 01:26:49.578
Yes, we should be.

01:26:49.787 --> 01:26:52.873
- Do you want the bidding program now?
- In a moment.

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:58.045
Did you see the game last night?
Two out, Bumbry's up.

01:26:58.254 --> 01:27:00.172
He hits a ball to left field.

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:03.592
White misses it and goes for a triple.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.220
Lungs, 1100 grams.

01:27:06.971 --> 01:27:09.431
Kidneys, 780, 620.

01:27:10.016 --> 01:27:12.476
Eighty and six-twenty.

01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:14.978
What about the heart?

01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:18.565
- I wrote it down someplace.
- What's the temperature?

01:27:18.983 --> 01:27:21.109
Right now, 12 degrees centigrade...

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.820
...and all the rest at 14.

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:27.157
Bottom of the ninth.

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.717
- Hey.
- What?

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.844
- Where's that heart going?
- Um...

01:27:49.639 --> 01:27:50.931
San Francisco.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:53.433
I think they're getting
$75,000 for it.

01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:56.812
- Is that all?
- It was a bad match on tissue-typing.

01:27:57.021 --> 01:27:59.523
Only two out of four.
But it's a rush order.

01:27:59.732 --> 01:28:02.734
The kidney's a four-tissue match
and in perfect condition.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.070
They'll get 200 grand for that.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.698
It's going to Texas.
A millionaire's son.

01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:09.992
Good old George has the connections.

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:13.412
So far, George is doing fine.
What about the other kidney?

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:16.540
They're putting it up for bids.
They'll get 100 for it.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:19.668
We have a left kidney,
two hours old, ready to ship.

01:28:19.877 --> 01:28:22.754
It's a 4367. A 31-year-old male.

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:25.048
The bidding now stands
at forty-two five.

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:27.968
Thank you.

01:28:28.177 --> 01:28:29.303
Forty-five.

01:28:29.512 --> 01:28:30.762
Hello? It's at 45.

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:33.015
Well, it could be in Zurich in...

01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:36.852
The fastest routing is New York-Rome.
It'll arrive local time...

01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:40.647
...1300 hours, which means
elapsed time is 23 hours.

01:28:40.857 --> 01:28:45.485
Twenty-three hours elapsed time,
which would make it 1 p.m. your time.

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.195
That's the best we can do.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:49.698
Thank you.

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:50.907
Hello.

01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:58.081
What's that?

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.251
Look at monitor four.

01:29:04.547 --> 01:29:06.882
All units!

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:09.134
There is an unauthorized woman
in the building.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:12.262
- Contain this person maintaining...
- Let's take her alive.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:14.139
Don't shoot.

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.934
Visiting room, clear. Over.

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:21.396
Second floor lobby, clear.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:24.691
Has anyone checked
the main care facility? Over.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:27.486
We have no reports from that sector.

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:43.794
Now on the second floor corridor.

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.536
System's all clear. Repeat.

01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:22.290
Don't you have a key to this place?

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:30.006
No intruders on sub-basement one.

01:30:30.174 --> 01:30:33.593
Repeat: No intruders
on sub-basement one.

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:37.264
Unit one, she's out on the ledge.
It's too far for her to jump.

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:43.437
I don't see her.

01:30:43.646 --> 01:30:46.982
She's out there.
She won't get far. We got her now.

01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:50.944
Have the dogs start on the north
side and circle the building.

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:54.197
I want security at all exits.
Notify them by radio.

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:58.660
Search the labs and the roof.
I've had enough of this inefficiency.

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:01.037
Perimeter dog team, come in.

01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:02.205
Repeat. Come in!

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.921
Main control, any readings
from outside? Where are the dogs?

01:32:13.736 --> 01:32:15.946
I don't know where the hell she is.

01:32:16.155 --> 01:32:18.573
She's got to be around
here somewhere.

01:32:31.128 --> 01:32:32.837
There, there.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:40.512
It's going to be all right.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:08.164
First floor lobby, check in.

01:33:08.624 --> 01:33:10.959
First floor lobby, please respond.

01:33:11.502 --> 01:33:13.169
No, she's not here.

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.630
Of course I've been notified.

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:18.425
I'm keeping an eye out for her.

01:33:18.718 --> 01:33:23.013
If she comes here, we'll get her.
There's no way she can escape.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:46.244
Let's get this loaded quick.

01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:49.581
I got to make it in time
for the Dallas flight.

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.875
And we got rush-hour traffic.

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:54.919
Even with the siren,
I gotta get through the tunnel.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.381
Life gets tougher all the time.

01:33:59.383 --> 01:34:00.800
I see you got the dogs out.

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:04.387
- We got a little security problem.
- We all got problems.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:06.598
World's full of problems.

01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:12.228
Take it away!

01:34:48.599 --> 01:34:50.975
Dr. Rogers, 2204.

01:34:51.143 --> 01:34:54.604
Dr. Earl Rogers, 2204.

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:12.247
Do me a favor, will you?

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:15.291
Don't say anything to upset her.

01:35:15.459 --> 01:35:16.918
I wouldn't say anything.

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:19.462
She's an old woman. She's sick.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.923
- She may die.
- Did the doctor say that?

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:25.343
- I don't know.
- You don't know what the doctor said?

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:29.472
- I'll believe what the doctor says.
- Just don't upset her.

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.683
This could be it.

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:33.309
This could be the end.

01:35:37.773 --> 01:35:39.399
It's incredible.

01:35:41.152 --> 01:35:44.571
Well, I could use a drink.
How about you? Scotch?

01:35:45.948 --> 01:35:47.407
Whatever you're having.

01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:50.160
I like a woman who drinks Scotch.

01:35:53.664 --> 01:35:55.415
You've done a remarkable thing, Sue.

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:57.917
Your dedication...

01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:00.044
...your concern...

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:03.214
...your pursuit of this problem.

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:06.468
It's all extremely impressive.

01:36:07.636 --> 01:36:08.928
And I'm very grateful.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.848
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

01:36:16.562 --> 01:36:19.022
In fact, I'm more than grateful.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:21.691
I'm deeply in your debt.

01:36:23.694 --> 01:36:25.820
The question is,
how do we handle this?

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:27.530
You arrest Dr. George.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:32.494
Yes.

01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:34.996
Sorry, Dr. Harris.
It's Landis in Washington.

01:36:35.372 --> 01:36:36.498
Put him on.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.333
Excuse me.

01:36:41.253 --> 01:36:42.629
Hello, Tom. How are you?

01:36:43.714 --> 01:36:46.007
Fine, fine, just fine.

01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:49.302
Sure, I'd be delighted to testify.

01:36:49.512 --> 01:36:52.055
You know how strongly I feel
about the matter.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:54.516
But have you consulted
the president?

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:56.100
Uh-huh.

01:36:56.268 --> 01:36:57.310
I see.

01:36:58.437 --> 01:36:59.646
This won't take long.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:09.197
Uh-huh.

01:37:15.746 --> 01:37:16.746
Good, good.

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.631
Good. Thanks for calling, Tom. Bye.

01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:35.473
You've put me in a
difficult position, Sue.

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.685
It seems you know everything.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:45.525
You're George.

01:37:45.776 --> 01:37:48.444
I wonder if you can understand...

01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:52.532
...if you can take the long view...

01:37:53.909 --> 01:37:57.453
...the view of a person in my position.

01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:03.334
You did it?

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:06.379
No decision is easy, Sue.

01:38:06.672 --> 01:38:09.465
It only looks that way
when you're young.

01:38:10.467 --> 01:38:12.218
When you're older...

01:38:12.678 --> 01:38:15.346
...everything is complicated.

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:18.391
There is no black and white.

01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:20.268
Only gray.

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:24.939
But our society faces
momentous decisions.

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:28.651
Decisions about the right to die...

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:31.905
...about abortion,
about terminal illness...

01:38:32.114 --> 01:38:34.991
...prolonged coma, transplantation.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:38.036
Decisions about life and death.

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:40.496
But society isn't deciding.

01:38:40.831 --> 01:38:43.583
Congress isn't deciding.
The courts aren't deciding.

01:38:43.792 --> 01:38:45.960
Religion isn't deciding. Why?

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:50.340
Because society is leaving it
up to us, the experts.

01:38:50.507 --> 01:38:51.674
The doctors.

01:38:53.844 --> 01:38:54.844
You're crazy.

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:58.973
Americans spend $125 billion
a year on health.

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:00.475
More than defense.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:03.853
Because Americans believe
in medical care.

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:08.733
These great hospital complexes
are the cathedrals of our age.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:12.445
Billions of dollars,
thousands of beds...

01:39:13.238 --> 01:39:16.616
...a whole nation of sick people
turning to us for help.

01:39:22.164 --> 01:39:23.623
You...

01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:26.209
You ought to see somebody.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:28.878
- They're children, Sue.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:30.546
They trust us.

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:34.050
We can't tell them everything.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:39.555
Our job is to make things easier
for them. I'm sure you agree.

01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:42.392
You're killing people.

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:46.354
We must always take the long view...

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:51.067
...not of the individual,
but of society as a whole...

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:55.613
...because medicine is now
a great social force.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.367
The individual is too small.

01:40:08.919 --> 01:40:10.336
That's the drug.

01:40:10.963 --> 01:40:15.299
It produces abdominal spasm
and peritoneal symptoms.

01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:18.011
It must be very painful.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:21.639
It's too bad.

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:26.436
But look at it from
the practical standpoint.

01:40:26.812 --> 01:40:31.232
Somebody has to make these decisions.
We can't wait around forever.

01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:33.776
If society won't decide,
we'll decide.

01:40:33.944 --> 01:40:35.737
We'll make the hard decisions.

01:40:43.412 --> 01:40:44.996
This is Dr. Harris.

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:49.042
Schedule an emergency
appendectomy in O.R. 8.

01:40:49.793 --> 01:40:51.836
It's a member of the house staff,
Dr. Wheeler.

01:40:52.087 --> 01:40:54.797
I've examined her.
She requires immediate surgery.

01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:56.507
Okay, honey, now just sit up.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:59.218
Come on, that's it. That's good.

01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:02.680
Yes. Here we go.

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:04.640
It's...

01:41:04.975 --> 01:41:06.017
...the drug.

01:41:06.185 --> 01:41:08.227
Yes, yes, it's gonna be just fine.

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:09.979
Doctors make the worst patients.

01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:12.148
They know too much, I guess.

01:41:17.529 --> 01:41:20.156
Dr. Edwards, 1011.

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:22.366
Dr. Edwards, 1011.

01:41:22.534 --> 01:41:25.536
Susan. Susan.

01:41:26.663 --> 01:41:28.331
Why'd you run away?

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:31.501
I was just talking to your mother.
She was worried about you.

01:41:31.668 --> 01:41:34.587
- Mark. Mark.
- Everybody's been worried about you.

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:38.716
Mark.

01:41:39.093 --> 01:41:40.676
Honey, I love you.

01:41:41.512 --> 01:41:43.012
You're gonna be just fine.

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:44.972
No, Mark, listen.

01:41:45.307 --> 01:41:47.016
You have to stop this.

01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:49.852
I'm fine. I am.

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:53.397
- But your appendix is not fine.
- No, Mark.

01:41:53.690 --> 01:41:56.400
You've got plus-four peritonitis,
guarding and spasm, honey.

01:41:56.568 --> 01:41:59.028
- No.
- Susan, you do.

01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:00.696
No, I don't.

01:42:02.699 --> 01:42:04.492
There's no question about it.

01:42:07.246 --> 01:42:11.707
Mark. Check my white count
and sed. rate. It's normal.

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:13.835
Please.

01:42:20.843 --> 01:42:21.926
Huh.

01:42:22.094 --> 01:42:24.387
- The tests aren't here.
- Unh.

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:29.142
But with these physical signs,
it has to be appendicitis.

01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:30.393
Please!

01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:32.812
It's better to be safe
and have the operation.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.064
- Unh.
- Besides, you're in the best of hands.

01:42:35.274 --> 01:42:38.651
Dr. Harris himself will do
the procedure, huh? How about that?

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.903
The chief of surgery
is taking your case.

01:42:41.071 --> 01:42:42.321
I don't want him.

01:42:42.531 --> 01:42:46.075
- Well, how's our patient doing?
- Fine. Just slightly delirious.

01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:48.911
That's normal with appendicitis.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:52.039
Besides, we all know doctors
make the worst patients.

01:42:52.374 --> 01:42:53.583
You gonna scrub in?

01:42:53.792 --> 01:42:57.211
Dr. Harris, we have O.R. 7
ready for your case.

01:42:57.421 --> 01:42:59.172
I wanted O.R. 8.

01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:01.007
It isn't ready yet.

01:43:01.216 --> 01:43:05.720
- I specifically requested O.R. 8.
- It'll take a couple of minutes.

01:43:05.929 --> 01:43:08.931
Well, hurry it up. Our patient
can't wait all night, can she?

01:43:11.059 --> 01:43:12.101
You scrubbing in?

01:43:12.978 --> 01:43:15.938
Uh, excuse me.
Let me just answer this page, sir.

01:43:21.904 --> 01:43:23.487
Yeah, this is Dr. Bellows.

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:24.739
Yes, Dr. Bellows.

01:43:24.948 --> 01:43:25.948
It's that serious, huh?

01:43:26.408 --> 01:43:28.284
Is what that serious?

01:43:28.493 --> 01:43:29.994
All right, I'll be right there.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:31.787
Dr. Bellows?

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:36.375
We're ready in O.R. 8, Dr. Harris.

01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:38.044
We'll start at once.

01:43:38.295 --> 01:43:39.378
Bellows?

01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:41.797
Patient on surgical two's
got convulsions.

01:43:41.965 --> 01:43:44.008
- Join me as soon as you can.
- Yes, sir.

01:43:44.301 --> 01:43:46.010
You can take her in.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.473
You certainly are lucky
with Dr. Harris doing the operation.

01:43:50.807 --> 01:43:53.142
Couldn't ask for a better man, huh?

01:43:53.352 --> 01:43:55.144
- I want—
- Now, now, just lie back.

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:58.147
You're going to have a nice sleep.
Just relax.

01:43:58.523 --> 01:44:00.316
Easy, we'll take good care of you.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.695
I found the oxygen line.
It starts in the basement...

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.781
...and it goes up the main tunnel...

01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:10.493
...and then it plugs in the ceiling
that goes to O.R. 8.

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:17.083
Do we have enough sponges?

01:44:17.292 --> 01:44:21.003
We better order some more
4-0 Chromex. We're almost out.

01:44:41.858 --> 01:44:44.193
We have to do this one right.

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:49.657
House officers deserve the very best
of care in their own hospital.

01:44:54.705 --> 01:44:58.332
I'm giving you Pentothal.
Take some good, deep breaths, dear.

01:45:00.335 --> 01:45:02.003
- In and out.
- Unh.

01:45:23.108 --> 01:45:24.608
The patient's film, Dr. Harris.

01:45:25.402 --> 01:45:26.986
They look normal, don't they?

01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:31.615
Pity acute appendicitis doesn't
show up more clearly in the x-rays.

01:45:39.249 --> 01:45:40.666
She has an inny.

01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:42.084
A what?

01:45:42.294 --> 01:45:44.754
An inny. The bellybutton.

01:45:45.088 --> 01:45:47.715
Some are innies, some are outties.
Hers is an inny.

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:08.486
Let me know when she's fully under.

01:46:13.742 --> 01:46:15.534
She's ready for you.

01:46:16.119 --> 01:46:17.161
Scalpel, please.

01:47:04.209 --> 01:47:06.919
- What's that?
- It's a PVC.

01:47:08.547 --> 01:47:09.588
There's another one.

01:47:10.215 --> 01:47:11.340
Too light?

01:47:11.716 --> 01:47:13.008
I don't think so, sir.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.511
Maybe you'd better deepen anesthesia.

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:28.816
Blood pressure's dropping.
I don't understand.

01:47:29.693 --> 01:47:32.403
- Want me to stop?
- No.

01:47:33.071 --> 01:47:34.113
It'll be all right, sir.

01:47:34.698 --> 01:47:38.742
- I'll be happy to stop a moment.
- It's okay, Dr. Harris.

01:47:39.161 --> 01:47:40.494
You recommend I go on?

01:47:52.048 --> 01:47:53.090
Son of a...

01:47:56.678 --> 01:48:01.140
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:02.892
Here it is.

01:48:04.019 --> 01:48:05.394
Hmm.

01:48:05.854 --> 01:48:08.272
Looks normal.
Never know it from her symptoms.

01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:11.442
It's nice to see the chief
get caught sometimes.

01:48:12.277 --> 01:48:13.819
Happens to the best of us.

01:48:14.946 --> 01:48:16.906
Okay.

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:31.712
All right.

01:48:33.381 --> 01:48:35.299
- You can bring her out now.
- Right, sir.

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.767
- Uh-oh, Dr. Harris.
- Yes?

01:48:44.935 --> 01:48:46.852
She's not coming around.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.272
Just give her a minute.
I'm sure she'll be just fine.

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440
I don't know, sir.

01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:04.578
She's okay, sir.

01:49:05.163 --> 01:49:07.289
She's just fine, Dr. Harris.

01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:09.166
Nice case, Dr. Harris.

01:49:49.874 --> 01:49:53.085
Mark. Mark.

01:49:54.170 --> 01:49:56.880
- Don't let him do the operation.
- I know, baby.

01:49:57.591 --> 01:49:59.008
I know.

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:17.234
We're waiting for you, Dr. Harris.
