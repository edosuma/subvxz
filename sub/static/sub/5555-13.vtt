00:13.541 --> 00:15.907
Good night and sweetly dreams.

00:15.943 --> 00:17.178
Oh, no.

00:17.463 --> 00:20.946
Good night and sweet dreams.

00:34.877 --> 00:38.993
PequeÃ±o, how you got out of cage, yeah?

00:52.679 --> 00:55.480
Stop it, stop it, stop!

00:55.515 --> 00:58.750
Uh... who are you yelling at?

00:58.785 --> 01:01.449
No one. I just...
still have writer's block. That's all.

01:01.483 --> 01:03.364
So, you're taking it out on your laptop?

01:03.469 --> 01:06.213
No, not the laptop. The... That cursor.

01:06.319 --> 01:09.029
Just look at it there, taunting me,

01:09.043 --> 01:10.903
just blinking on, off, on, off,

01:10.969 --> 01:13.620
like it's so easy writing
a best-selling novel.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.678
'Cause I'd like to see you try it,
Mr. Cursor!

01:15.784 --> 01:16.934
I'd like to see you try it!
So why don't we...

01:16.969 --> 01:20.771
You know what? Why don't we
just say goodbye to Mr. Cursor?

01:22.274 --> 01:23.613
What is this, fan mail?

01:23.679 --> 01:24.880
Oh, not exactly.

01:24.946 --> 01:26.910
Remember I went on
"Good Morning America"

01:26.945 --> 01:28.389
a while back and offered
a reward for proof

01:28.508 --> 01:29.946
of anyone who knew what happened to me

01:29.959 --> 01:31.107
during those eight weeks I disappeared?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.283
But, Castle,
those letters are over a year old,

01:33.336 --> 01:34.218
and we've already proven

01:34.253 --> 01:35.619
that all the theories were ridiculous.

01:35.654 --> 01:36.550
Why are you re-reading them?

01:36.602 --> 01:38.654
Looking to spark my imagination.

01:38.690 --> 01:41.233
But, honestly,
these letters are not very inventive.

01:41.325 --> 01:42.975
They all either claim I was a victim of

01:43.001 --> 01:46.330
a government conspiracy or
abducted by aliens and probed.

01:46.365 --> 01:49.799
This guy even drew a diagram
of me being violated by E.T.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.869
I need inspiration, Beckett,

01:52.904 --> 01:55.946
and although Lester's knowledge
of alien anatomy is commendable,

01:55.972 --> 01:57.806
it is just not enough.

01:59.076 --> 02:01.677
Ah. Sorry. One second.

02:01.712 --> 02:03.034
Beckett.

02:03.113 --> 02:05.844
Okay. All right. I will be right there.

02:08.270 --> 02:09.919
You know that I would love to take you,
but...

02:10.065 --> 02:13.155
But we have to maintain
the ruse of our separation

02:13.190 --> 02:13.856
until you capture LokSat.

02:13.891 --> 02:15.123
I know. I know. I just...

02:15.159 --> 02:17.526
What am I supposed to write
about without my muse, Beckett?

02:17.562 --> 02:19.663
I need you.
I-I'm Sherlock without Watson.

02:19.729 --> 02:22.447
No, you probably mean
Watson without your Sherlock

02:22.526 --> 02:26.035
Because, after all,
my darling, you're the writer.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.469
Okay. I'll see you.

02:27.504 --> 02:29.204
Uh, you know what?

02:29.239 --> 02:30.739
Why don't you just go
to your P.I. office

02:30.775 --> 02:32.575
if you're so desperate
for a case to solve?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.376
Maybe Alexis and Hayley have something

02:34.411 --> 02:37.345
that's worthy of... inspiration.

02:41.352 --> 02:43.451
Good morning, Ryan.

02:43.487 --> 02:44.319
Hey.

02:44.354 --> 02:46.688
So, I, uh, saw the broken door outside.

02:46.723 --> 02:48.690
- Robbery gone wrong?
- No, we don't think so.

02:48.725 --> 02:50.292
According to the zoo supervisor,

02:50.327 --> 02:51.760
all the animals are accounted for.

02:51.796 --> 02:52.928
Is that a snake hook?

02:52.963 --> 02:55.697
Yep. Looks like our victim was
bludgeoned to death with it.

02:55.732 --> 02:57.499
Okay. Who's the victim?

02:58.306 --> 03:00.201
Uh, we're not 100% sure yet.

03:00.236 --> 03:03.438
The zoo supervisor thinks
that it's Eddie Ramirez,

03:03.491 --> 03:04.823
the nighttime animal caretaker.

03:04.889 --> 03:06.908
If it is,
then he's an El Salvador native

03:06.943 --> 03:07.909
who's lived in the States
for the past few years...

03:07.975 --> 03:10.178
Yeah, I'm sorry. Uh, can we go back?

03:10.214 --> 03:12.714
Why are you having trouble
I.D.ing the victim?

03:13.463 --> 03:15.916
We can't positively I.D. the victim yet

03:15.951 --> 03:19.753
because the killer
tossed his body into...

03:19.788 --> 03:22.789
A pit filled with deadly snakes.

03:26.019 --> 03:29.196
Okay. Well, that's a first.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.167
Your fearless leader has arrived.

03:34.202 --> 03:35.802
Oh, yay. Now go file these.

03:35.838 --> 03:37.624
Well, I take it business has been good.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.773
Yeah,
we're working on three cases right now.

03:39.808 --> 03:41.635
Got a corporate malfeasance,
an insurance fraud,

03:41.648 --> 03:43.469
and a financial embezzlement.

03:43.521 --> 03:46.547
Wow. You know what all three
of those cases have in common?

03:46.582 --> 03:49.716
They are all incredibly boring.
You guys, come on!

03:49.751 --> 03:51.295
- When did you sell out?
- Excuse me?

03:51.335 --> 03:53.019
I think what you meant to say,
Rick, was,

03:53.055 --> 03:55.570
"Thank you so much, ladies,
for taking my money pit of a hobby

03:55.658 --> 03:57.824
and making it into a
profitable business."

03:57.860 --> 03:59.493
I didn't open this place to make money.

03:59.528 --> 04:01.762
I opened it for the exciting cases,
you know?

04:01.797 --> 04:04.564
The double-crossing dame,
the stolen relic,

04:04.599 --> 04:06.266
a locked-room mystery.

04:06.301 --> 04:08.739
Dad, you're just naming plots
from 1940s gumshoe novels.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.336
Speaking of,
aren't you supposed to be writing

04:10.372 --> 04:11.638
your next Nikki Heat book?

04:11.674 --> 04:13.506
Would if I could. Come on, guys.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.709
Let's just ditch this corporate nonsense

04:15.744 --> 04:19.012
and find a case worthy of investigating,

04:19.048 --> 04:22.247
you know, with mysteries,
with bold characters

04:22.283 --> 04:23.315
and twists and turns and...

04:23.350 --> 04:26.251
Murdered man ends up in
a pit of deadly snakes?!

04:26.287 --> 04:27.920
Now, that...

04:27.955 --> 04:30.056
That is a case worth investigating.

04:30.825 --> 04:31.791
Hey.

04:31.826 --> 04:33.059
Well, hello, Captain.

04:33.095 --> 04:34.560
I'm glad you're alone.

04:34.596 --> 04:36.729
I've been meaning to say
how proud I am of you.

04:36.765 --> 04:38.697
Oh. For what?

04:38.732 --> 04:41.133
For breaking up with Mr. Castle,
of course.

04:41.168 --> 04:44.736
Now you're free to meet a man
who can really appreciate you.

04:44.772 --> 04:45.737
Um...

04:45.773 --> 04:46.805
Like my brother, Edgar.

04:46.840 --> 04:47.973
Your, uh, brother?

04:48.009 --> 04:49.308
My identical twin.

04:49.343 --> 04:50.642
Oh, there's two of you?

04:50.677 --> 04:52.644
- I'd be happy to introduce you...
- Yeah, no.

04:52.679 --> 04:55.280
Uh, no, but, uh, thank you, Perlmutter.

04:55.315 --> 04:59.201
It's just that I-I'm not
quite ready to date right now.

04:59.553 --> 05:01.953
I understand that you have confirmed

05:01.989 --> 05:04.756
that our victim is Eddie Ramirez, right?

05:04.791 --> 05:07.626
Yes. Here are his personal effects.

05:07.661 --> 05:11.095
Cause of death was blunt-force
trauma to the skull.

05:11.131 --> 05:12.930
- Mm-hmm.
- Based on lividity,

05:12.965 --> 05:15.108
I'd say it took place between
9:00 and 11:00 last night.

05:15.192 --> 05:17.502
So, then, the killer must have
dumped his body in the snake pit

05:17.538 --> 05:19.270
to slow down our investigation.

05:19.305 --> 05:20.705
Genius plan.

05:20.741 --> 05:23.408
Mr. Castle,
what the hell are you doing here?!

05:23.443 --> 05:24.442
It is nice to see you, too, Perlmutter.

05:24.477 --> 05:27.444
Can't you see the lady
doesn't love you anymore?

05:27.479 --> 05:28.920
Be a man. Walk away.

05:28.994 --> 05:32.449
See, it's because of
nitwit pretty boys like you

05:32.484 --> 05:35.019
that good men like my brother,
Edgar, struggle to find...

05:35.054 --> 05:36.086
Uh, Perlmutter,

05:36.121 --> 05:38.776
would you mind giving us
the room just for a moment?

05:39.659 --> 05:42.993
There's a scalpel and a rib
spreader if you need them.

05:44.563 --> 05:45.963
Wow.

05:45.998 --> 05:47.464
Perlmutter really doesn't like me.

05:47.499 --> 05:48.832
Neither do I right now.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.867
I know, I know,
I just wanted to see the snakes.

05:50.902 --> 05:53.003
Help yourself, Castle.
They are all at the zoo.

05:53.038 --> 05:54.004
Really? They're not here?

05:54.039 --> 05:55.705
I thought they would be
evidence or something.

05:55.740 --> 05:56.523
No, but this might be.

05:56.572 --> 05:59.093
Someone sent the victim
a text yesterday.

05:59.128 --> 06:00.427
"Where go my money, Eddie?

06:00.462 --> 06:03.096
Yous owe huge. Paybacks time.

06:03.131 --> 06:06.066
I got ways for to get you dead."

06:06.101 --> 06:08.335
It was sent by a blocked number.

06:08.370 --> 06:09.903
I'll see if Vikram can trace it.

06:09.938 --> 06:12.272
"I got ways for to get you dead."

06:12.308 --> 06:14.441
That's particular syntax,
unique grammatical structure,

06:14.476 --> 06:16.242
perhaps denoting a
cultural significance.

06:16.277 --> 06:18.010
Or maybe bad autocorrect.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.078
No, Beckett. This was no error.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.046
This was a specific choice.

06:21.082 --> 06:22.860
It was a methodical decision,
Dialectology 101,

06:22.959 --> 06:25.752
and I,
being an expert in the English language,

06:25.788 --> 06:28.488
would be happy to help you
solve this linguistic mystery.

06:28.524 --> 06:30.590
Castle, you're not gonna work the case.

06:30.626 --> 06:33.158
So, why don't you just,
uh, go back home,

06:33.193 --> 06:35.115
and I will see you tonight.

06:35.973 --> 06:38.216
While I do love kissing you, Beckett,

06:38.266 --> 06:39.699
it's just a little creepy

06:39.734 --> 06:41.301
when you do it in front of a dead body.

06:41.336 --> 06:43.536
It's... inappropriate.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.539
Captain, check out what we found

06:46.574 --> 06:48.974
hidden under Eddie Ramirez's bed.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.742
Ten G's. The question is

06:50.777 --> 06:53.645
how does someone who feeds
snakes and lizards for a living

06:53.680 --> 06:54.974
scrape together this much cash?

06:55.007 --> 06:56.682
Now, that threatening
text that Eddie received

06:56.717 --> 06:57.616
was about owing someone money.

06:57.652 --> 06:59.919
I'd be shocked if those
two aren't related.

06:59.954 --> 07:02.055
If they are,
then I might be of assistance.

07:02.090 --> 07:04.290
Turns out the text was sent
from an untraceable burner,

07:04.325 --> 07:05.757
but when the text was sent,

07:05.792 --> 07:07.692
it had to go through a wireless network.

07:07.727 --> 07:08.793
- Did you track down the network?
- Yep.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.430
It belongs to an English-
as-a-second-language school.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.065
Is there any connection
to Eddie Ramirez?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.199
I spoke with a teacher who said

07:14.234 --> 07:15.267
Eddie was a part of the class,

07:15.302 --> 07:17.135
but he was absent yesterday
when the text was sent.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.803
All right, guys. Go check it out.

07:18.838 --> 07:19.671
All right.

07:19.706 --> 07:24.141
To get to JFK airport from here,

07:24.177 --> 07:26.400
you can take the E train.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.513
But since you are late for your flight,

07:28.548 --> 07:30.915
I suggest you take a cab.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.319
But since you are late for your flight,

07:34.354 --> 07:37.522
I suggest you take a cab.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.122
Yo, we're NYPD.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.157
We need to talk.

07:40.192 --> 07:43.260
Yo, we're NYPD.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.996
We need to talk.

07:46.031 --> 07:48.590
This thing about Eddie is quite a shock.

07:48.689 --> 07:50.835
The students have been
talking about it all morning.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.637
We understand that Eddie
missed class yesterday.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.538
Do you know if he was avoiding
any of the other students,

07:54.573 --> 07:55.906
perhaps someone he was
having problems with?

07:55.941 --> 07:58.842
Eddie? No.
He was a sweet man, a gentle soul.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.076
Everybody liked him.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.044
Well, not everybody.

08:01.079 --> 08:03.881
This text was sent
yesterday during class.

08:03.947 --> 08:05.381
Any idea who might have written that?

08:05.418 --> 08:06.684
"Where go my money, Eddie?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.353
Yous owe huge. Paybacks time."

08:09.388 --> 08:11.254
I don't know. It's... It's hard to say.

08:11.289 --> 08:13.123
All my students are
still learning English.

08:13.158 --> 08:14.691
Well, then we're gonna need
to talk to all your students,

08:14.727 --> 08:15.726
one by one.

08:15.761 --> 08:17.761
That's gonna be harder than you think,
Detective.

08:17.796 --> 08:19.562
Most of my students come from countries

08:19.598 --> 08:20.430
where the cops are corrupt,

08:20.465 --> 08:22.398
so they're not gonna
want to talk to you.

08:22.434 --> 08:24.400
Look, teach.

08:24.436 --> 08:25.802
We don't tell you how
to conjugate a verb.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.637
Don't tell us how to
interview a suspect.

08:27.672 --> 08:29.538
Yeah. We're gonna get them to talk.

08:30.174 --> 08:32.140
And you couldn't get
any of them to talk?

08:32.176 --> 08:33.626
Javi did get a contact number

08:33.745 --> 08:35.578
for Eddie's next of kin in El Salvador.

08:35.613 --> 08:36.779
That's true, but there was no one home,

08:36.815 --> 08:38.347
so I had to leave a message.

08:38.383 --> 08:39.482
Captain,
we can drag each of the students

08:39.517 --> 08:41.784
down into interrogation,
sweat the truth out of them.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.352
Uh, no.
If they're already afraid of cops,

08:43.388 --> 08:46.088
it's only gonna alienate them further.

08:46.123 --> 08:48.457
But there might be
another way to do this.

08:48.492 --> 08:49.758
What do you have in mind?

08:49.793 --> 08:50.826
Uh, don't worry about it.

08:50.862 --> 08:52.728
Why don't you guys dig
into those students' lives?

08:52.763 --> 08:55.731
Clearly, one of them is hiding
their true feelings about Eddie.

08:55.766 --> 08:57.466
All right.

09:11.314 --> 09:13.014
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing?

09:13.049 --> 09:14.415
Nothing. Just reading a book.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.784
Uh,
do you really think you can figure out

09:16.819 --> 09:18.685
who sent that text based on linguistics?

09:18.720 --> 09:19.519
Yeah, I can do that.

09:19.554 --> 09:20.320
All I have to do is hear them speak

09:20.356 --> 09:22.155
and I can match the syntax. Why?

09:22.191 --> 09:24.291
Well, you might be able to
work this case after all,

09:24.326 --> 09:26.326
at least in an undercover capacity.

09:26.362 --> 09:27.928
Really?!

09:27.963 --> 09:28.896
How?

09:29.799 --> 09:31.265
Bonjour, everyone.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.401
Je m'appelle Jean-Luc Delacroix.

09:34.303 --> 09:37.170
Hello, Jean-Luc.

09:38.865 --> 09:41.092
S08E13
And Justice for All

09:41.174 --> 09:43.433

09:44.690 --> 09:45.422
Hello, Jean-Luc. Welcome to our

09:45.457 --> 09:47.623
English-as-a-second-language class.

09:47.722 --> 09:50.587
- Thank you very much, monsieur.
- That accent is fascinating.

09:50.661 --> 09:51.893
Where are you joining us from?

09:51.929 --> 09:53.195
Uh, JonquiÃÂ¨re, QuÃ©bec.

09:53.231 --> 09:54.696
French Canadian.

09:54.731 --> 09:56.464
- Oui.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

09:56.499 --> 09:59.367
And what do you do there for a living?

09:59.402 --> 10:03.538
I am, uh, how you say... I am a chef.

10:03.573 --> 10:04.606
- A chef!
- Oui.

10:04.641 --> 10:05.740
Marvelous.

10:05.775 --> 10:08.610
We're having our international
food celebration tonight.

10:08.645 --> 10:11.778
Cannot wait to sample some of
your authentic French cuisine.

10:11.813 --> 10:13.614
Oui. Me, too.

10:13.649 --> 10:15.415
Well, class, it's time for us to

10:15.451 --> 10:17.951
break out into our
smalltalk discussions.

10:17.986 --> 10:19.919
Why don't we get up and circulate.

10:19.955 --> 10:21.455
- I'll just, uh...
- Please.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.490
Merci, merci. Hello, I am Jean-Luc.

10:23.525 --> 10:24.591
Nice to meet you.

10:24.627 --> 10:26.993
Hi. I am Kim HyunJoo from Korea.

10:27.028 --> 10:28.961
That is it? Please don't be shy.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.896
Tell me more about yourself.

10:33.534 --> 10:35.568
Anything?

10:35.603 --> 10:37.570
Uh, okay. All right.

10:37.605 --> 10:40.038
Alistair Durcoyne.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.280
Good. Okay. Very nice to meet you.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.948
Hi. I am Aida N'Diaye from Senegal.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.484
EnchantÃ©. I am Jean-Luc.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.586
Ah, so, what brings you to America?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.655
Oh.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.923
Ah, you are speaking French
like back in Senegal.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.826
But we are supposed to speak English,
oui?

11:01.861 --> 11:03.794
I have come to America

11:03.829 --> 11:07.331
because it is my dream to become
a successful painter someday.

11:07.366 --> 11:08.599
Oh, very good.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.436
Ah, oui.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.604
Hello. I am Jean-Luc.

11:13.639 --> 11:15.773
Hi. I am Achmed.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.040
I urinate now.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.776
Okay.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.610
Hello. I am Jean-Luc.

11:36.993 --> 11:37.859
Excuse me, monsieur.

11:37.894 --> 11:40.662
Perhaps it would help me to,
how you say,

11:40.698 --> 11:42.063
catch up with the rest of the class

11:42.098 --> 11:44.199
if I was able to look
at their assignments.

11:44.234 --> 11:45.534
You'll be fine, Jean-Luc.

11:45.569 --> 11:48.136
In fact,
your English is already quite good.

11:50.541 --> 11:51.573
Ah, excuse me.

11:51.608 --> 11:54.809
One of the other students
would like your attention.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.110
In the back. Keep looking.

12:03.185 --> 12:04.752
Hey.

12:04.787 --> 12:06.153
I figured out who sent the text.

12:06.188 --> 12:08.522
Guy's name is Alistair Durcoyne.

12:08.558 --> 12:09.990
- Are you sure it's him?
- Yeah.

12:10.025 --> 12:11.858
The grammatical structure in the text,

12:11.893 --> 12:13.192
"I got ways for to make you dead"

12:13.228 --> 12:15.328
is a direct match to
his homework assignment

12:15.364 --> 12:17.831
where he wrote,
"I went for to get some beer."

12:17.866 --> 12:20.933
Good job, Castle. I'll have
Ryan and Espo take it from here.

12:20.969 --> 12:22.369
Are you gonna tell them
about my involvement?

12:22.404 --> 12:23.670
I have to.

12:23.705 --> 12:26.606
I mean, I'll say you found out
about the ESL class on your own

12:26.641 --> 12:28.940
and that I had no idea that
you were going undercover.

12:28.976 --> 12:30.676
- You think they'll buy it?
- Oh, I don't know.

12:30.711 --> 12:32.711
I mean, when have you ever
gone against my wishes

12:32.747 --> 12:34.680
and interfered with an investigation?

12:34.715 --> 12:36.515
No need for sarcasm.

12:36.550 --> 12:37.716
All you had to say was "Yes."

12:38.919 --> 12:39.818
So, we just got off the phone

12:39.854 --> 12:42.688
with Metropolitan Police
Service in London.

12:42.723 --> 12:45.189
They sure did have a lot
to say about you, Alistair.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.224
Multiple arrests
for assault and battery.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.693
They said that you were an enforcer

12:48.728 --> 12:51.128
for a loan shark named Jimmy
"The Bones" Barrett.

12:51.163 --> 12:52.129
Did you move to America

12:52.164 --> 12:54.699
and go into business for yourself,
Alistair?

12:54.734 --> 12:56.534
Did Eddie owe you money?
Is that why you killed him?

13:07.876 --> 13:09.789
Hey, if this guy is from England,

13:09.905 --> 13:11.422
why doesn't he speak English?

13:11.718 --> 13:13.518
I don't know.

13:13.553 --> 13:16.187
But I think I know
just the person to ask.

13:22.091 --> 13:23.136
He's a Geordie.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.175
From Newcastle.

13:24.241 --> 13:25.890
Though technically English,

13:25.989 --> 13:28.165
the language has evolved to include

13:28.200 --> 13:30.835
a certain unique vocabulary
and grammatical structure.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.915
I can translate.

13:34.072 --> 13:35.672
You threatened to kill Eddie.

13:41.590 --> 13:44.261
Oh, he says that he only
sent Eddie the text message

13:44.416 --> 13:45.482
because he was furious.

13:49.388 --> 13:50.319
He drives a gypsy cab,

13:50.355 --> 13:52.022
and Eddie asked to
borrow it two nights ago.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.964
So, when Alistair got the gypsy
cab back the next morning,

14:00.999 --> 14:02.498
it was riddled with bullet holes.

14:02.534 --> 14:03.733
So someone shot up your cab.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.240
That's why he was so livid.

14:11.276 --> 14:12.909
Eddie promised that he
would pay for the damage,

14:12.944 --> 14:14.077
but then he didn't show up for class.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.984
He thought that Eddie
was trying to dodge him,

14:21.019 --> 14:22.885
and so that's why he sent
him the threatening message,

14:22.920 --> 14:24.053
but he swears he didn't mean it.

14:24.088 --> 14:25.921
He was just really pissed off.

14:25.956 --> 14:28.857
Um, let's assume that
Alistair is telling the truth.

14:28.893 --> 14:30.767
Do you know where he took your cab?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.630
Do you know if he was meeting someone?

14:32.779 --> 14:34.364
Mnh-mnh.

14:34.399 --> 14:36.132
Mnh-mnh.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.967
So, tell us about your gypsy cab.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.768
Does it have GPS?

14:39.803 --> 14:40.869
Aye.

14:40.905 --> 14:42.570
Well, Alistair alibied out.

14:42.606 --> 14:45.607
He was blind drunk at a pub
during our time of death window.

14:45.642 --> 14:47.142
And what about his gypsy cab?

14:47.177 --> 14:48.504
Looks like Alistair
was telling the truth.

14:48.570 --> 14:51.447
Wherever Eddie drove that cab,
someone tried to kill him.

14:51.483 --> 14:54.016
Wow. Sounds like our
mild-mannered zoo worker

14:54.051 --> 14:55.484
rattled a few cages.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.919
Actually,
Eddie wasn't so mild-mannered after all.

14:57.954 --> 15:00.522
I got in touch with his
next of kin in El Salvador.

15:00.557 --> 15:01.490
Eddie used to be a cop.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.658
Wait. He was a cop?

15:03.693 --> 15:05.494
Why are we just hearing about this now?

15:05.529 --> 15:06.861
He lied on his immigration forms.

15:06.896 --> 15:08.130
Why wouldn't Eddie want people to know

15:08.165 --> 15:09.297
he's a former police officer?

15:09.333 --> 15:11.433
I thought that was strange,
too, so I did a little digging.

15:11.468 --> 15:12.366
Apparently, there were rumors

15:12.401 --> 15:14.649
that Eddie was part of
a corrupt police unit.

15:14.732 --> 15:16.204
And these guys were accused of

15:16.239 --> 15:18.573
extorting criminals, taking bribes.

15:18.608 --> 15:22.477
Hey. So, I've gone through the
GPS on Alistair's gypsy cab.

15:22.512 --> 15:24.178
Looks like Eddie only made one stop,

15:24.214 --> 15:25.714
a place called the Saldana Club.

15:25.749 --> 15:27.248
Okay. What do we know about this place?

15:27.283 --> 15:29.883
It's run by Jose and Frankie Saldana,

15:29.918 --> 15:30.951
a couple of low-level players,

15:30.986 --> 15:33.554
but they got priors for
assault and trafficking.

15:33.589 --> 15:36.056
Plus, word is they deal
drugs out of their club.

15:36.091 --> 15:37.563
Well, if Eddie used to shake
down crooks back in El Salvador,

15:37.727 --> 15:39.360
maybe he was doing the same
thing to these guys here.

15:39.395 --> 15:40.929
And they might have killed him for it.

15:40.964 --> 15:42.697
Let's go.

15:50.406 --> 15:52.473
Jose and Frankie Saldana?

15:52.508 --> 15:53.874
Yeah. Who's asking?

15:55.744 --> 15:58.412
So, what happened?
Someone drop a grenade in here?

15:58.447 --> 16:00.214
We're redecorating. You like?

16:00.249 --> 16:02.415
Looks like you boys got
into a little trouble.

16:02.450 --> 16:04.417
- Yeah. Rock-climbing accident.
- Mm.

16:04.452 --> 16:07.420
See, Frankie here forgot how to
tie one of those fancy knots.

16:08.824 --> 16:10.290
Whoopsie.

16:10.325 --> 16:12.225
So, it's got nothing to
do with Eddie Ramirez,

16:12.260 --> 16:13.594
the guy you took a shot at...

16:13.629 --> 16:15.929
Sorry. I have to get water.

16:15.965 --> 16:16.964
Eddie Ramirez.

16:16.999 --> 16:18.497
- Never heard of him.
- Really?

16:18.532 --> 16:20.833
Because if a short
50-year-old man broke my face

16:20.868 --> 16:22.997
and stole 10 grand, I'd remember.

16:26.107 --> 16:28.007
Uh, something on your mind?

16:28.042 --> 16:29.387
They're lying their asses off.

16:29.453 --> 16:30.710
That man, Eddie Ramirez?

16:30.745 --> 16:32.846
- He was here.
- What happened?

16:32.881 --> 16:35.147
Came in all calm. Next thing I know,

16:35.183 --> 16:37.683
he's beating the crap
out of Jose and Frankie.

16:37.718 --> 16:39.685
Forced them to fill up
a briefcase with cash.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.153
And you saw that all happen?

16:41.189 --> 16:42.888
Oh, yeah. As Eddie was walking out,

16:42.924 --> 16:44.412
Frankie grabbed a gun
from under the bar,

16:44.528 --> 16:46.408
hobbled out, and shot up the guy's car.

16:46.474 --> 16:48.156
Okay, then what about last night?

16:48.255 --> 16:50.217
Did they go after Eddie,
try to get their revenge?

16:50.299 --> 16:52.658
They couldn't have.
They were both laid up in the hospital.

16:52.756 --> 16:54.765
Just got released this morning.

16:55.236 --> 16:57.069
Why would Eddie come here to
shake them down for money?

16:57.104 --> 16:59.171
I don't think this was
a straight-up shakedown.

16:59.207 --> 17:01.140
I overheard Eddie saying
that he was doing this

17:01.175 --> 17:02.674
for some girl who used to work here.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.143
A waitress.

17:04.178 --> 17:05.243
What girl?

17:05.279 --> 17:07.478
Aida.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.247
You think she killed Eddie?

17:09.281 --> 17:12.317
Well, all we know is that the
Saldana brothers alibied out.

17:12.352 --> 17:14.752
And clearly she's wrapped
up in all of this.

17:14.787 --> 17:17.488
Why am I here? I've done no wrong.

17:17.522 --> 17:20.424
We just have a few
questions about Eddie Ramirez.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.528
Look, Aida, we know about the
robbery at the Saldana Club.

17:25.564 --> 17:31.101
Eddie saw me crying after
class three days ago.

17:31.136 --> 17:35.172
I was, um...

17:35.207 --> 17:38.307
Very upset because I was
fired from Saldana Club.

17:38.411 --> 17:39.777
So, why were you fired?

17:39.812 --> 17:41.278
I work two years there,

17:41.313 --> 17:44.514
but because I-I don't have green card,

17:44.549 --> 17:48.685
Jose and Frankie make me
give them 30% of my paycheck.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.420
- They were extorting you?
- Yes.

17:50.455 --> 17:52.622
But from taking ESL class,

17:52.657 --> 17:55.558
I get self-esteem and I demand my money.

17:55.594 --> 17:57.360
That when they fire me.

17:57.395 --> 18:00.629
When Eddie heard, he was very furious.

18:00.664 --> 18:04.200
He say he would stand up to
them and get all my money back.

18:04.235 --> 18:05.134
Okay, if that's the case,

18:05.169 --> 18:06.903
then why didn't Eddie
give you the money?

18:06.938 --> 18:08.604
But Eddie was going to.

18:08.639 --> 18:12.708
He called me yesterday morning
to say he got $10,000 for me.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.642
I just had to wait

18:13.677 --> 18:16.144
because he was not
coming to class that day.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.213
So why wasn't Eddie
coming to class yesterday?

18:18.248 --> 18:22.284
He tell me he was helping
another student with a problem,

18:22.319 --> 18:26.154
a very dangerous problem.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.090
Wait, Eddie was helping
another student from the class?

18:29.126 --> 18:31.091
- Who?
- Eddie did not say.

18:31.127 --> 18:34.652
But, uh, when he told me,
he sound very nervous.

18:34.751 --> 18:39.333
Eddie say he uncover
a terrible conspiracy.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.317
Uh, what kind of conspiracy?

18:40.416 --> 18:42.403
Eddie did not say.

18:42.438 --> 18:45.306
That was the last time I hear from him.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.474
If Eddie was helping other
students in his class,

18:47.509 --> 18:50.508
- then that means...
- He was the ESL Equalizer.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.478
- Pardon me?
- The Equalizer.

18:52.514 --> 18:53.680
From the TV show. And the movie.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.150
He's a highly skilled operative
who exacts vigilante justice

18:57.185 --> 18:58.785
for innocent people who
can't defend themselves.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.520
Yes, I am familiar with it, Castle,

19:00.555 --> 19:03.023
but Robert McCall's
character was a good guy.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.157
Eddie is a corrupt cop.

19:05.192 --> 19:08.060
Well, maybe he's making amends,
atoning for previous sins.

19:08.095 --> 19:10.095
Isn't that what the
American dream is all about,

19:10.131 --> 19:12.364
- trying to build a better future?
- Well, all I know is that

19:12.399 --> 19:14.033
I'm trying to build a
better case right now,

19:14.068 --> 19:16.568
and if Eddie was helping
one of his fellow students

19:16.603 --> 19:18.370
with a dangerous problem, then...

19:18.405 --> 19:20.605
That might be what got him killed.

19:21.863 --> 19:23.473
And this is Achmed Sahid.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.874
He immigrated to this country
from Pakistan two years ago.

19:25.966 --> 19:29.133
He was a radar-systems
engineer in the military.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.102
Achmed? Wow.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.236
And what does he do now?

19:32.271 --> 19:33.658
He runs a hot dog cart in Chelsea.

19:33.856 --> 19:35.670
This is Kim Hyun-Joo from Korea.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.674
She's over here on an au
pair visa for six months.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.677
And this is Ernie Gonzalez,
originally from BogotÃ¡.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.413
Now, this guy was a lawyer.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.048
Now he's temping as a delivery driver

19:44.083 --> 19:45.749
for Ronny's Chicken Hut.

19:45.784 --> 19:46.583
What about Diego?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.586
- Ah.
- Diego Lopez from Mexico City.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.688
He works at an elementary
school as a janitor.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.356
And what did he do back home?

19:53.392 --> 19:55.191
Worked at an elementary
school as a janitor.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.126
Hmm.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.061
These people all
immigrated to this country

19:58.096 --> 19:59.195
in search of a better life.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.487
It looks like Eddie was trying
to help them achieve that.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.566
The question is how do we figure out

20:02.601 --> 20:04.134
who else Eddie was helping?

20:04.169 --> 20:06.169
Well,
tonight is international food night,

20:06.204 --> 20:08.138
and since Jean-Luc is a chef,

20:08.173 --> 20:09.906
I will be plying them
with French delicacies.

20:09.941 --> 20:11.124
You packing poutine?

20:11.289 --> 20:13.743
Javier,
I'll have you know that French Canadians

20:13.778 --> 20:15.671
are proud descendents
of Parisian culture.

20:15.737 --> 20:17.749
No, I'll be serving them pastries

20:17.750 --> 20:19.201
from La Bernardin restaurant.

20:19.299 --> 20:20.950
Uh, Castle,

20:20.985 --> 20:22.631
that's one of the premiere
French restaurants in the world.

20:22.730 --> 20:24.220
They don't do takeout.

20:24.256 --> 20:27.023
Perhaps not
for Jean-Luc Delacroix,

20:27.058 --> 20:29.558
but they will for Richard Castle.

20:31.729 --> 20:32.928
Sorry about that.

20:42.973 --> 20:44.273
Salut, mes amis!

20:44.308 --> 20:45.474
Oh!

20:45.509 --> 20:48.843
- Bonjour, Jean-Luc. Hello.
- Well, those look good.

20:48.879 --> 20:50.812
So, the police were questioning you?

20:50.847 --> 20:53.361
Yes. They want to hear
how Eddie was helping me.

20:53.427 --> 20:56.251
But I-I don't think it's
what got him killed.

20:58.289 --> 20:59.387
Ah.

20:59.422 --> 21:01.522
Did the police have any
information about the case?

21:01.558 --> 21:03.391
They did not tell me more.

21:03.426 --> 21:05.630
Did Eddie ever say anything to you?

21:05.712 --> 21:08.296
No. Nothing.

21:11.469 --> 21:12.834
You eat my japchae?

21:12.869 --> 21:16.304
Oh, uh, uh, of course.

21:26.983 --> 21:28.016
Jean-Luc?

21:28.051 --> 21:29.117
What's wrong?

21:29.152 --> 21:30.676
You don't like it.

21:32.556 --> 21:34.888
No, um, fantastique.

21:34.924 --> 21:36.990
Where did you say this dish was from?

21:37.026 --> 21:38.392
I think I've had it somewhere before.

21:38.428 --> 21:39.860
I doubt that's true.

21:39.895 --> 21:42.797
It's a family recipe from my village.

21:42.832 --> 21:43.964
Oh.

21:43.999 --> 21:46.367
Uh, very nice. Um, excusez-moi.

21:51.606 --> 21:54.374
Achmed, are you all right?
You seem upset.

21:55.744 --> 21:58.778
Do you know who else Eddie was helping?

21:58.813 --> 22:00.880
Yes.

22:00.916 --> 22:02.049
Me.

22:02.084 --> 22:03.792
I-I-I came to him with a problem.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.784
What was the problem?

22:05.819 --> 22:08.454
A girl in my building is missing.

22:08.489 --> 22:09.765
She is... undocumented.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.590
Before she disappear,

22:11.625 --> 22:14.135
she tell me someone was forcing
her to pay money or else.

22:14.296 --> 22:15.762
And you told Eddie this?

22:15.797 --> 22:17.202
Yes. He promised to find her.

22:17.432 --> 22:19.499
I-I ask about this the day he die,

22:19.534 --> 22:22.568
and Eddie say it was all more
dangerous than he thought.

22:22.603 --> 22:25.504
Eddie said he discovered
a terrible conspiracy.

22:25.539 --> 22:28.574
And now he's dead, all because of me.

22:28.609 --> 22:30.542
No, Achmed. It is not your fault.

22:30.578 --> 22:32.011
But perhaps I can help.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.380
Uh, what is this girl's name?

22:34.415 --> 22:35.815
Anita Rodriguez.

22:35.947 --> 22:38.206
So, I looked into our missing neighbor,
Anita Rodriguez.

22:38.319 --> 22:39.818
Now, because she's undocumented,

22:39.853 --> 22:41.620
there's next to no public record of her,

22:41.655 --> 22:43.655
but I did find out that she was working

22:43.691 --> 22:46.292
at a cleaning company off the books.

22:46.327 --> 22:47.926
Now, a week and a half ago,

22:47.962 --> 22:52.598
she missed her shift and hasn't been...
seen... since.

22:52.633 --> 22:53.799
Are you okay?

22:53.834 --> 22:55.800
Yeah, I...

22:55.835 --> 22:58.050
Something weird happened
at ESL class tonight.

22:58.271 --> 23:00.005
- What happened?
- Hey!

23:00.040 --> 23:02.273
So, we just got back from
Anita Rodriguez's apartment.

23:02.309 --> 23:03.742
We got a hit on a print.

23:03.777 --> 23:04.910
Marco Sutter?

23:04.945 --> 23:07.946
Yeah, he's an enforcer from
up in the Corona neighborhood.

23:07.981 --> 23:09.581
Organized crime has a file on this guy.

23:09.616 --> 23:12.049
Extortion, money laundering,
assault with intent.

23:12.085 --> 23:13.951
All right. Go pick him up.

23:25.398 --> 23:27.164
Marco Sutter?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.865
NYPD.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.301
Hold it right there.

23:35.441 --> 23:36.840
Gun!

23:44.157 --> 23:45.981
Let's go!

23:46.016 --> 23:47.164
Go!

23:49.522 --> 23:50.924
- NYPD!
- Let me see your hands!

23:51.006 --> 23:52.623
Let me see your hands right now!

23:52.705 --> 23:55.179
Put them out the window, now!

23:57.363 --> 23:58.262
Here's what I think.

23:58.297 --> 24:00.463
You tried to extort a
powerless immigrant,

24:00.498 --> 24:02.432
and when she couldn't pay,
you killed her.

24:02.467 --> 24:04.700
And when Eddie Ramirez
came looking for her,

24:04.735 --> 24:05.634
you killed him, too.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.971
I want a lawyer.

24:11.476 --> 24:13.542
- Hey.
- Macro lawyered up.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.511
But check this out.

24:15.546 --> 24:17.980
We found something interesting
tucked inside his wallet.

24:18.015 --> 24:20.882
We traced it to a locker out
at the G.W. Bridge bus station.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.185
I doubt Marco is keeping
his laundry there.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.987
Could be evidence we
can use as leverage.

24:25.022 --> 24:26.888
We'll look into it.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.992
Oh, what a day.

24:30.027 --> 24:31.226
Tell me about it.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.678
Pit of snakes, getting shot at it.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.363
Thank God it's almost over.

24:35.399 --> 24:37.832
I don't think that I could
take any more excitement.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.235
FBI! Get down, get down, get down!

24:52.352 --> 24:55.146
Do you know how long the
FBI's been on this case?

24:55.410 --> 24:56.754
Two years!

24:56.790 --> 24:59.891
Before Crockett and Tubbs
here T-boned my stakeout.

24:59.926 --> 25:02.459
Detectives Ryan and Esposito

25:02.495 --> 25:04.829
are investigating a homicide,
Agent Napier.

25:04.864 --> 25:06.831
And no FBI alert came across my desk

25:06.866 --> 25:08.299
about your precious little stakeout,

25:08.334 --> 25:10.434
so why don't you drop the attitude?

25:10.469 --> 25:11.568
How'd you find that locker?

25:11.603 --> 25:14.671
Our murder suspect had a key
on him when we arrested him.

25:14.707 --> 25:17.473
And this suspect, does he have a name?

25:17.509 --> 25:19.409
No. Not until you tell
me what's going on.

25:19.444 --> 25:21.564
Oh, I'm not at liberty to discuss

25:21.630 --> 25:23.163
the specifics of my case.

25:23.213 --> 25:24.032
Okay.

25:24.068 --> 25:25.167
Then I guess we're done here.

25:25.202 --> 25:27.568
It's Marco Sutter, isn't it?

25:27.603 --> 25:29.904
It's the only logical
person to have a key.

25:29.939 --> 25:31.205
You need to let him go.

25:31.241 --> 25:32.640
Screw that.

25:32.675 --> 25:33.641
He shot at us.

25:33.676 --> 25:34.776
I don't care.

25:34.811 --> 25:37.711
Well, you should,
because if we let him go after that,

25:37.747 --> 25:40.014
he's gonna figure out why pretty fast.

25:40.049 --> 25:42.716
I'm guessing Marco's the
low man on your totem pole

25:42.752 --> 25:44.259
and you're tracking the money
from his shakedown operations

25:44.325 --> 25:45.286
to get to your real target.

25:45.321 --> 25:47.888
So, why don't you let us
in on the investigation

25:47.923 --> 25:48.922
and we can work this together?

25:48.958 --> 25:53.027
Mm. That's not in my playbook,
but you're right.

25:53.062 --> 25:55.363
Marco is small potatoes.

25:55.398 --> 25:56.563
So, you go ahead and keep him.

25:56.599 --> 26:00.066
You just remember...
My federal case trumps your homicide.

26:00.102 --> 26:02.369
So you steer clear.

26:07.075 --> 26:09.276
So, you gonna let that
pretty boy steamroll us?

26:09.312 --> 26:11.011
No. If Marco killed Eddie,

26:11.046 --> 26:12.179
then we are gonna take him down

26:12.214 --> 26:13.580
along with anyone connected to him.

26:13.616 --> 26:15.215
We have to tread lightly,

26:15.250 --> 26:17.283
so I'm gonna reach out
to my guys in the FBI

26:17.319 --> 26:19.385
and see if they can tell
us what Napier's up to.

26:20.443 --> 26:22.388
Castle.

26:24.493 --> 26:25.893
Uh, what's going on?

26:25.928 --> 26:28.495
Hey. Where's your passport?

26:28.531 --> 26:30.330
We've got to go to Korea.

26:30.365 --> 26:31.131
Why?

26:31.166 --> 26:33.298
Because I finally figured it out.

26:33.334 --> 26:34.767
My missing time?

26:34.802 --> 26:37.436
It... Now it all makes sense.
It mostly makes sense.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.438
Wait a minute, is this about
what happened in your classroom?

26:39.473 --> 26:41.273
I ate a dish today.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.675
It triggered a memory.

26:42.710 --> 26:45.477
I was in Korea surrounded by locals,

26:45.513 --> 26:47.813
and I could see that temple.

26:47.849 --> 26:48.981
Tongdosa Temple.

26:49.017 --> 26:50.314
It's in the South Gyeongsang province.

26:50.350 --> 26:52.417
Okay, well,
we know that you were in Thailand,

26:52.452 --> 26:53.317
so Korea's not a stretch.

26:53.353 --> 26:55.319
Yeah,
I must have gone there right after.

26:55.355 --> 26:56.320
But why?

26:56.356 --> 26:57.989
I have no idea.

26:58.059 --> 27:00.292
I-I ordered more food in hopes
of jogging another memory.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.060
It didn't work, but that's okay.

27:01.095 --> 27:02.061
When we get to Korea, all the...

27:02.096 --> 27:04.163
No, no, no.
Castle, I'm not going to Korea.

27:04.198 --> 27:06.297
Yeah, you're right.
I should go first. That way...

27:06.332 --> 27:07.732
And neither are you.

27:07.768 --> 27:09.333
We don't have enough information yet.

27:09.369 --> 27:11.535
It's too dangerous.
You almost got killed in Thailand.

27:11.571 --> 27:12.568
Yeah.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.605
Yes, you're right.

27:14.641 --> 27:17.169
I'll just try to keep
triggering more memories loose.

27:17.278 --> 27:18.677
Are you in the mood for some kimchi?

27:18.712 --> 27:20.846
'Cause I bought like $400 worth

27:20.881 --> 27:23.047
and... the stuff goes right through me.

27:24.951 --> 27:27.418
So, so far, there's no physical evidence

27:27.454 --> 27:29.253
linking Marco to Eddie's murder.

27:29.289 --> 27:30.855
You have any insight from
your federal contacts?

27:30.890 --> 27:32.090
Only that Agent Napier

27:32.125 --> 27:34.105
specializes in fraud
and financial crimes.

27:34.227 --> 27:36.461
Well, since when does financial
crimes trump homicide?

27:36.497 --> 27:38.062
Never, as far as I'm concerned.

27:38.098 --> 27:40.949
Who's the sexiest digital
investigator alive?

27:43.435 --> 27:45.669
There is no way I'm saying you, bro.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.272
Okay. What do you got?

27:49.308 --> 27:51.208
Anita Rodriguez.

27:51.243 --> 27:52.937
And she's alive.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.790
She's in Texas, being held in
a private detention center,

27:55.839 --> 27:57.007
awaiting deportation.

27:57.069 --> 27:58.430
Thank God she's all right.

27:58.574 --> 27:59.749
How on earth did you find her?

27:59.784 --> 28:02.085
There must be hundreds of
Anita Rodriguezes out there.

28:02.121 --> 28:03.220
Her fingerprints.

28:03.255 --> 28:05.589
And the paper trail for how
she ended up at the facility

28:05.624 --> 28:07.390
- is pretty thin.
- Intentionally so?

28:07.426 --> 28:08.798
Maybe. But there was
one name I could track.

28:08.943 --> 28:10.961
Judge Jason Caldwell.

28:10.996 --> 28:14.364
He signed the deportation order,
and from his record,

28:14.399 --> 28:15.799
there is nothing he likes in this world

28:15.834 --> 28:17.600
more than deporting foreigners.

28:17.636 --> 28:18.601
But that doesn't prove

28:18.637 --> 28:20.704
that he had anything to
do with Eddie's murder.

28:20.739 --> 28:22.806
No,
but this is pretty damn incriminating.

28:22.841 --> 28:23.973
The day before the murder,

28:24.008 --> 28:27.109
our victim got in a shoving
match with Judge Caldwell

28:27.145 --> 28:27.977
at the courthouse.

28:28.012 --> 28:29.778
Eddie must have connected the Judge

28:29.814 --> 28:31.213
to Marco's extortion scheme

28:31.248 --> 28:32.381
and gone down there to confront him.

28:32.416 --> 28:35.267
If Eddie threatened to expose
the criminal conspiracy,

28:35.386 --> 28:37.420
the judge would have a
strong motive to kill him.

28:37.455 --> 28:38.421
I-I don't get it.

28:38.456 --> 28:40.356
The financial upside
to extorting immigrants

28:40.391 --> 28:41.591
cannot be that high.

28:41.626 --> 28:44.693
Why would a judge who makes six
figures a year get involved?

28:44.728 --> 28:48.263
My assumption is Marco kept the
extortion money for himself.

28:48.298 --> 28:49.297
What would the judge get out of it?

28:49.332 --> 28:51.767
Huge kickbacks from a
private prison in Texas.

28:51.802 --> 28:53.268
According to Judge
Caldwell's financials,

28:53.303 --> 28:54.436
he's got a sweetheart deal

28:54.471 --> 28:56.872
with a company that runs a
detention center in El Paso.

28:56.907 --> 28:59.507
He literally gets paid
for every bed he fills.

28:59.543 --> 29:01.479
So, Marco shakes down
the immigrants for money.

29:01.611 --> 29:02.878
Sooner or later, they run out of cash,

29:02.913 --> 29:05.247
and then Caldwell ships them to Texas.

29:05.282 --> 29:06.514
And gets paid.

29:06.549 --> 29:07.682
I hate this guy.

29:07.717 --> 29:09.017
Me too. Let's bring him in.

29:09.052 --> 29:10.718
No, wait.
You guys, he's a federal judge.

29:10.754 --> 29:12.353
We can't just go after him.

29:12.389 --> 29:13.955
If we're wrong, then we'll...

29:15.311 --> 29:19.093
Wait. Go full on the security cam.

29:19.128 --> 29:21.228
You guys, look at the janitor.

29:21.264 --> 29:22.663
He's wearing an ear piece.

29:22.698 --> 29:24.265
Why would a janitor need an ear piece?

29:24.300 --> 29:26.100
So's the guy on the
bench with the newspaper.

29:26.135 --> 29:28.269
Which means it's an
FBI surveillance team

29:28.304 --> 29:29.703
following the judge.

29:29.738 --> 29:31.438
He must be the FBI's real target.

29:31.473 --> 29:34.574
Oh, we can't go at this guy,
not with the Feds watching.

29:34.610 --> 29:36.442
Napier clearly stated

29:36.477 --> 29:38.611
that we were not to step
on his investigation.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.514
The NYPD can't.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.749
But I can...

29:43.785 --> 29:45.685
with a little help from my friends.

29:50.506 --> 29:51.973
Caldwell is on the move.

29:52.008 --> 29:53.340
Heading to the courthouse.

29:59.315 --> 30:01.282
- Oh!
- I am so sorry!

30:01.317 --> 30:02.750
Oh, a thousand pardons.

30:02.786 --> 30:04.252
Get out of the way.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.289
Oh!

30:09.324 --> 30:10.991
Hi!

30:11.026 --> 30:12.625
Your baby's so adorable.

30:12.661 --> 30:14.795
So is yours.

30:17.627 --> 30:19.699
Excuse me.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.820
Team two, subject is coming your way.

30:49.698 --> 30:50.863
Sorry. We can't help you.

31:03.244 --> 31:04.977
Uh, service elevator down the hall.

31:05.012 --> 31:07.046
Oh, thank you.

31:16.757 --> 31:18.990
Hey,
did the judge go up in the elevator?

31:19.025 --> 31:20.592
No entiendo.

31:20.627 --> 31:22.026
Damn it.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.696
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

31:45.318 --> 31:47.518
This can't be right.

31:47.553 --> 31:49.687
Where's the service elevator?

31:51.524 --> 31:53.791
Oh, my God.

31:53.826 --> 31:55.393
You killed my fiancÃ©.

31:55.428 --> 31:57.628
Hold on. I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:57.663 --> 31:58.896
You are Judge Caldwell.

31:58.931 --> 32:01.164
You murdered my fiancÃ©, Eddie Ramirez.

32:01.611 --> 32:02.908
I-I have no idea who that is.

32:02.909 --> 32:04.035
Stop telling lies.

32:04.070 --> 32:05.736
I know you are the one who did it.

32:05.771 --> 32:07.538
Lady, listen,
you don't want to do this, all right?

32:07.573 --> 32:09.640
He... He's not worth it.

32:09.675 --> 32:11.142
Aah!

32:13.679 --> 32:15.713
O-Okay!

32:15.748 --> 32:17.180
I did know him,

32:17.216 --> 32:19.316
but I-I promise I didn't kill him.

32:19.351 --> 32:20.550
I didn't have to.

32:20.585 --> 32:22.467
What do you mean you didn't have to?

32:22.516 --> 32:23.934
The guy was a cop!

32:23.967 --> 32:25.289
He had enemies.

32:25.325 --> 32:28.092
A-And the enemies of my enemies...

32:28.127 --> 32:29.927
What?

32:39.791 --> 32:41.938
What is this, some kind of a setup?

32:43.508 --> 32:46.243
Who the hell are you people?

32:46.278 --> 32:47.544
You...
You had better tell me what happened

32:47.579 --> 32:48.712
or I'm going to shoot you.

32:48.747 --> 32:50.446
The hell you will.

32:52.783 --> 32:53.916
Let him go.

32:53.952 --> 32:56.193
Damn it. We were so close.

32:56.655 --> 33:00.022
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

33:00.058 --> 33:02.091
Do you think the judge dropped a dime

33:02.126 --> 33:03.993
to one of Eddie's enemies
back in El Salvador?

33:04.028 --> 33:05.762
Question is how did the judge find out

33:05.797 --> 33:07.463
the names of Eddie's
enemies back in El Salvador?

33:07.498 --> 33:09.130
I don't know, but Castle said

33:09.166 --> 33:11.767
that the judge referenced
Eddie's past as a cop.

33:11.802 --> 33:13.969
Why don't you guys see
if you can find out

33:14.004 --> 33:15.646
who had a beef with Eddie
back in his home country?

33:15.739 --> 33:17.739
Captain Beckett.

33:17.775 --> 33:21.843
Do you have any idea what you've done?

33:21.879 --> 33:24.912
I have a feeling you're
about to tell me.

33:24.947 --> 33:27.649
We lose eyes on Judge Caldwell
for all of 10 minutes,

33:27.684 --> 33:29.217
and the next thing you know,
he's cancelled court

33:29.252 --> 33:30.626
and he's holed up with his lawyer.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.721
I'm sorry. Who is this judge, exactly?

33:32.757 --> 33:34.089
Knock it off, Captain.

33:34.124 --> 33:36.091
We know you were on to
Caldwell this morning.

33:36.126 --> 33:38.093
We pulled surveillance
video from the courthouse.

33:38.128 --> 33:40.060
Your husband and his
band of immigrant misfits

33:40.096 --> 33:41.095
are all over the footage.

33:41.130 --> 33:43.197
Okay, then I will make
sure my guys question them.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.932
Well, you better move fast,
'cause I plan on

33:44.967 --> 33:46.768
having each and every one
of them deported for this.

33:46.803 --> 33:48.906
No, you want to go after someone,
you go after me,

33:49.005 --> 33:50.271
but leave those people alone.

33:50.307 --> 33:51.907
They interfered with a
federal investigation.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.341
Their friend was murdered.

33:53.376 --> 33:55.110
They wanted justice,

33:55.145 --> 33:57.778
which includes the ability to
live and work in this country

33:57.814 --> 34:00.514
without being victimized by
a government-appointed judge

34:00.549 --> 34:02.416
or a power-hungry FBI agent.

34:02.451 --> 34:05.630
Eddie's killer was
solicited by Judge Caldwell,

34:05.745 --> 34:08.054
which means he's
complicit in the murder,

34:08.091 --> 34:10.324
so you help me identify his killer

34:10.359 --> 34:12.559
and we will put the good
judge away in federal prison

34:12.594 --> 34:14.460
for the rest of his life.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.231
Meet Alonzo Sanchez,

34:17.266 --> 34:18.764
foot soldier for the Sinaloa drug cartel

34:18.801 --> 34:20.000
based out of San Miguel.

34:20.036 --> 34:21.534
What's his connection to your case?

34:21.570 --> 34:24.071
Judge Caldwell expedited
his visa 48 hours ago.

34:24.106 --> 34:26.540
We weren't sure why until
you mentioned Eddie Ramirez.

34:26.574 --> 34:28.507
Turns out that they have history.

34:28.543 --> 34:30.109
Eddie killed Alonzo's brother, Mario,

34:30.145 --> 34:31.510
back when he was a cop in El Salvador.

34:31.545 --> 34:33.713
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

34:33.748 --> 34:36.514
This must be who Judge
Caldwell was talking about.

34:36.551 --> 34:38.451
Alonzo was out for
revenge against Eddie,

34:38.485 --> 34:40.619
and the judge was all too happy to help.

34:40.655 --> 34:43.356
Alonzo Sanchez landed at JFK

34:43.391 --> 34:44.958
four hours before Eddie was killed.

34:44.993 --> 34:46.757
Okay. Sounds like we have our killer.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.460
Now we just have to track him
down before he goes back home.

34:49.496 --> 34:50.329
We might be too late for that.

34:50.364 --> 34:52.047
He boarded a flight 15 minutes ago.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.966
- He's already in the air.
- Well, then we're done.

34:54.001 --> 34:55.967
There's no way we can get him now.

34:56.003 --> 34:58.871
Uh, you can't, but I can.

35:00.675 --> 35:02.607
This is Agent Napier.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.342
I need to turn a plane around.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.761
It's too bad your plane got rerouted,
Alonzo.

35:11.858 --> 35:13.557
On the bright side,
I spoke to the airline,

35:13.592 --> 35:15.926
and you're still gonna get the miles.

35:15.962 --> 35:17.694
You got nothing on me.

35:17.730 --> 35:19.262
I was here legally.

35:19.297 --> 35:20.930
And what was the purpose of your trip?

35:20.966 --> 35:24.167
- Visiting an old friend.
- Visiting or feeding him to the snakes?

35:24.202 --> 35:25.935
What?

35:25.971 --> 35:28.004
Come on, Alonzo. Drop the act.

35:28.039 --> 35:29.939
We know you came here for Eddie Ramirez.

35:29.975 --> 35:31.207
He killed your brother.

35:31.243 --> 35:34.244
And Judge Caldwell... He greased
the wheels to get you up here.

35:34.279 --> 35:36.044
Judge who?

35:36.080 --> 35:37.780
I don't know what you're talking about,
man.

35:37.815 --> 35:38.947
We tracked down the cab driver

35:38.983 --> 35:40.082
who picked you up from the airport

35:40.117 --> 35:42.987
and then took you to the zoo.
We know you killed Eddie.

35:43.185 --> 35:45.087
Eddie is dead?

35:45.939 --> 35:47.890
That wasn't me.

35:48.826 --> 35:51.426
Okay, the judge reached out to me,

35:51.462 --> 35:53.395
and, yes,
I went to the zoo to see Eddie,

35:53.430 --> 35:54.963
but I did not kill him.

35:54.999 --> 35:56.498
So, what did you come up here for, then?

35:56.533 --> 35:58.066
Little friendly chat?

35:58.102 --> 35:59.601
Maybe a frozen hot
chocolate at Serendipity?

35:59.636 --> 36:02.270
I came here with revenge in my heart.

36:02.306 --> 36:04.239
I thought that Eddie was responsible

36:04.274 --> 36:06.174
for my brother's death.

36:06.210 --> 36:07.775
But I was wrong.

36:07.811 --> 36:10.177
Eddie convinced me that he had
been working with my brother

36:10.213 --> 36:11.369
in secret, protecting him.

36:11.481 --> 36:12.280
Eddie would tell you anything

36:12.316 --> 36:13.715
if he thought you were gonna kill him,

36:13.750 --> 36:15.483
so what made you believe him?

36:15.519 --> 36:17.985
Eddie knew things about Mario

36:18.021 --> 36:20.522
that only someone close
to my brother would know,

36:20.557 --> 36:23.458
and his attitude wasn't that of
a man lying to save his life.

36:23.493 --> 36:24.592
What do you mean by that?

36:24.627 --> 36:27.027
Eddie hated the man that
he was back in El Salvador.

36:27.062 --> 36:29.496
What he did to protect my
brother weighed on him.

36:29.532 --> 36:32.966
He told me that he despised
everything my family stands for,

36:33.001 --> 36:34.453
what he used to stand for.

36:34.502 --> 36:36.070
That's why he came to America...

36:36.105 --> 36:39.073
To start over, build a new life here.

36:39.108 --> 36:42.375
And he did until somebody
took it away from him.

36:49.217 --> 36:50.183
Hey.

36:50.218 --> 36:51.714
Hey.

36:52.555 --> 36:53.620
Ooh.

36:53.656 --> 36:55.292
So, Alonzo alibied out.

36:55.424 --> 36:58.724
Looks like we were wrong about
Judge Caldwell's involvement.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.070
No. We're missing something.

37:00.162 --> 37:02.796
Eddie confronted the judge,
and the next day, he was killed.

37:02.831 --> 37:03.997
Well, we know it wasn't the judge.

37:04.033 --> 37:06.166
He was under 24-hour surveillance.

37:06.201 --> 37:07.300
And besides, he thought that

37:07.335 --> 37:09.502
Alonzo was gonna take care of it.

37:09.585 --> 37:11.151
Eddie confronts the judge.

37:11.234 --> 37:14.874
12 hours later, Alonzo's on a
plane with an approved visa.

37:16.745 --> 37:18.511
How did the judge even
know about Alonzo?

37:18.546 --> 37:19.812
- Who told him?
- No, you're right.

37:19.848 --> 37:21.181
We didn't even know about Alonzo.

37:21.216 --> 37:22.315
How did the judge find out so quickly?

37:22.351 --> 37:24.484
There has to be someone else
involved in this conspiracy,

37:24.519 --> 37:26.186
someone close to Eddie.

37:26.221 --> 37:29.655
The only people that are close
to him are in the ESL class.

37:29.691 --> 37:31.790
So, who would kill him?

37:32.927 --> 37:34.294
I think I know.

37:35.430 --> 37:36.396
And you know what this means, Beckett.

37:36.431 --> 37:39.999
After all these years,
I finally get to say,

37:40.034 --> 37:41.646
"J'accuse."

37:44.038 --> 37:46.005
So,
we're gonna focus in on the verbs.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.673
Now, if we had...

37:48.709 --> 37:51.009
Jean-Luc, you're late.

37:51.044 --> 37:52.277
Ah, oui, monsieur.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.712
Pardonnez-moi.

37:53.747 --> 37:55.314
That's all right. Have a seat.

38:00.188 --> 38:01.654
Actually, Monsieur Emerson,

38:01.690 --> 38:04.823
if I could just have a
word with you in private,

38:04.858 --> 38:06.391
s'il vous plait?

38:06.427 --> 38:07.526
Sure.

38:13.467 --> 38:15.967
Jean-Luc, did you bring these men here?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.636
Oh, yeah.
They're with me.

38:17.671 --> 38:19.804
They're here to arrest you for
the murder of Eddie Ramirez.

38:19.839 --> 38:20.838
What?

38:20.873 --> 38:22.840
We know you were working
with Judge Caldwell,

38:22.875 --> 38:24.975
funneling him immigrants from the school

38:25.010 --> 38:27.244
in exchange for a cut
of the extortion money.

38:27.279 --> 38:28.746
You knew each one of
their pressure points,

38:28.781 --> 38:30.280
which ones were illegal.

38:30.316 --> 38:32.096
- That's absurd.
- Oh, is it?

38:32.162 --> 38:33.885
Then why are so many of your students

38:33.921 --> 38:35.386
in those private detention centers?

38:35.422 --> 38:36.587
Too many to be a coincidence.

38:36.622 --> 38:38.689
It was a solid plan.
I mean, who's gonna notice?

38:38.724 --> 38:41.825
They're here alone,
marginalized by society.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.694
In your position,
I would have done the same thing.

38:43.729 --> 38:45.729
- No, you wouldn't.
- No, I would not.

38:45.765 --> 38:48.131
- I have a soul.
- Come on. Let's go.

39:01.546 --> 39:04.748
Everyone, I have some good news.

39:04.784 --> 39:08.118
Anita Rodriguez has been released.

39:08.154 --> 39:09.919
And a federal investigation
has been launched

39:09.954 --> 39:12.421
into the private detention
facility that was holding her.

39:12.456 --> 39:14.456
What about the judge?

39:14.492 --> 39:16.926
Your teacher sold him out.
He confessed everything.

39:16.961 --> 39:19.595
Now the FBI can properly
prosecute the judge,

39:19.630 --> 39:21.030
and justice has been served.

39:23.168 --> 39:24.100
C'est magnifique, huh?

39:24.135 --> 39:27.342
Oh, but, uh,
who will finish teaching us now?

39:27.474 --> 39:30.006
I saw on the website it's Mr. Castle.

39:32.843 --> 39:34.643
Uh, I-I'm so sorry.

39:34.678 --> 39:37.346
I have no idea how that got on there.

39:37.382 --> 39:41.484
I do, only the Castle who will
be filling in isn't a mister.

39:43.020 --> 39:44.486
- It's me.
- Really?

39:44.521 --> 39:46.354
Nice work.

39:46.390 --> 39:49.657
- Thanks.
- Darling, I am so proud!

39:49.692 --> 39:51.159
Isn't she lovely?

39:51.194 --> 39:52.327
Okay, everyone.

39:52.362 --> 39:53.713
Shall we dine? Follow me.

39:53.829 --> 39:54.730
Ah, yes.

39:54.765 --> 39:56.364
And, everyone, we are so glad

39:56.400 --> 39:57.666
that you were all able to join us.

39:57.701 --> 39:59.700
Now, we celebrated your food earlier.

39:59.736 --> 40:01.736
We think it's time for
you guys to celebrate

40:01.771 --> 40:03.604
some American food.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.340
And voilÃÂ .

40:06.375 --> 40:08.443
This is American food?

40:08.478 --> 40:10.377
It's very... international.

40:10.413 --> 40:11.612
Exactly.

40:11.648 --> 40:14.582
And this country was
founded by immigrants,

40:14.617 --> 40:17.050
and it's those customs and cultures

40:17.085 --> 40:18.919
that have shaped and molded us.

40:18.954 --> 40:21.047
And you...

40:21.190 --> 40:26.026
And you are the ones that
make this country great.

40:26.062 --> 40:28.329
Mother,
I couldn't have said it better myself.

40:28.364 --> 40:29.330
Now, let's dig in.

40:29.365 --> 40:30.965
Yes, yes.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.832
Plates behind you there.

40:54.154 --> 40:56.215
What is it?

40:56.380 --> 40:58.326
I wasn't in Korea.

40:58.425 --> 41:02.844
I was in Koreatown in Los Angeles.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.680
Beckett, I've got to go to L.A.
