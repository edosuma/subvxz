"THE MARRIAGE
OF HEAVEN AND HELL."

00:45.476 --> 00:48.819

became pregnant with Charlotte.

10:19.249 --> 10:22.022
MM. WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
MY FATHER AT ALL.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.324
IT'S ONE OF
MY DEEPEST REGRETS.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.757
I THINK GROWING UP
WITHOUT SOMEONE TO PROTECT YOU

10:26.757 --> 10:28.098
FROM THE WORLD

10:28.098 --> 10:30.200
FORCES YOU TO LEARN
HOW TO SURVIVE IN IT.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.032
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
WE BOTH HAVE IN COMMON.
 (camera shutter clicking)

10:32.032 --> 10:33.163
(man) TERRIFIC.

10:33.163 --> 10:34.334
LET'S GET
ANOTHER LIGHT READING.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.866
WE'RE COMING OFF
A LITTLE...

10:35.866 --> 10:37.868
CHARLOTTE, LOOK AT YOU.
(laughs)

10:37.868 --> 10:39.209
(man speaks indistinctly)

10:39.209 --> 10:40.971
YOU KNOW, THE LAST PHOTOGRAPHS
I HAVE OF THE TWO OF US

10:40.971 --> 10:42.212
ARE FROM MARTHA'S VINEYARD...
 BEAUTIFUL.

10:42.212 --> 10:44.174
AGES AGO.
 NICE.

10:44.174 --> 10:45.676
WE USED TO SPEND
SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER

10:45.676 --> 10:47.147
WHEN DANIEL WAS AWAY
AT HARVARD.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.679
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:48.679 --> 10:50.981
THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNED.

10:50.981 --> 10:52.983
WHAT'S SAY YOU AND I
GO OUT AFTER THIS,

10:52.983 --> 10:54.354
JUST THE TWO OF US?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.257
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I HAVE PLANS WITH DECLAN.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.228
WELL, THEN HOW ABOUT
THE THREE OF US?

10:58.228 --> 11:00.130
(man) AND ONE MORE
BIG SMILE.

11:00.130 --> 11:01.762
I'D LIKE TO GET TO KNOW
DECLAN BETTER, AND...
 GREAT.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.134
SMOOTH OVER ANY AWKWARDNESS
BETWEEN US.

11:04.134 --> 11:07.297
OH, YOU MEAN AFTER YOU TRIED
TO BRIBE HIM TO LEAVE ME ALONE?

11:07.297 --> 11:10.941
THAT'S KINDA HARD
TO SMOOTH OUT, MOM.

11:10.941 --> 11:14.274
I AM TRYING, CHARLOTTE.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.405
I AM.

11:15.405 --> 11:16.907
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

11:16.907 --> 11:19.149
ME. I AM.

11:19.149 --> 11:20.981
(man) LET'S, UH,
CUE UP A LITTLE MUSIC.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.112
SEE IF WE CAN GET
EVERYBODY IN THE MOOD

11:22.112 --> 11:23.413
TO GET THEIR SMILE ON.
 (pop music playing)

11:23.413 --> 11:24.785
(Charlotte) HEY, EMS.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.957
(laughs)

11:26.957 --> 11:28.989
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR
TO KEEP HER IN THE DARK.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.791
YOU NEED TO TELL HER.
 (Charlotte) SMILES OR NO SMILES?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.262
YOUR SISTER'S IN
A DELICATE PLACE RIGHT NOW,

11:32.262 --> 11:34.765
WITH THE DIVORCE
AND HER FATHER.

11:34.765 --> 11:36.226
THIS HAS TO BE
HANDLED PROPERLY.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.198
(camera shutter clicking)
 GREAT. BEAUTIFUL.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.030
BUT YOU ARE GONNA HANDLE IT,
AREN'T YOU?

11:40.030 --> 11:41.832
BECAUSE IF IT WERE ME,
I'D WANT TO KNOW.

11:41.832 --> 11:44.434
WHAT HURTS MORE IS FINDING OUT
YOU'VE BEEN LIED TO.

11:44.434 --> 11:46.436
(Ashley)
OKAY, OKAY, THE GROOM.

11:46.436 --> 11:48.308
COME OVER HERE.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.182
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

11:52.182 --> 11:53.884
BETTER
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

11:53.884 --> 11:55.886
SORRY I'M LATE.

11:55.886 --> 11:58.118
GRANDPA GRAYSON AMBUSHED
MY DAD AT THE SOUTHFORK.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.220
APPARENTLY,
MY MOTHER CALLED HIM.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.352
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON?
 I DON'T KNOW.

12:02.352 --> 12:05.125
BUT HE'S ALWAYS HAD
A SOFT SPOT FOR MY MOM

12:05.125 --> 12:06.496
MORE THAN MY DAD.

12:06.496 --> 12:09.860
DANIEL, JUST PUT YOUR ARM
AROUND HER AND ACT NATURAL.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.301
NOTHING ABOUT THIS
IS NATURAL.

12:11.301 --> 12:12.362
THEN TRY THE OTHER ARM.

12:12.362 --> 12:13.864
THINK ABOUT THE FIRST TIME

12:13.864 --> 12:15.505
YOU LAID YOUR EYES
ON EACH OTHER.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.338
(camera shutter clicking)
 "THE MARRIAGE...

12:18.338 --> 12:20.740
OF HEAVEN AND HELL,"
BY WILLIAM BLAKE.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.372
WILLIAM BLAKE, THE POET.

12:22.372 --> 12:24.514
I KNOW WHO THAT IS.
I TOOK BRIT LIT LAST SEMESTER.

12:24.514 --> 12:26.046
ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD.
LISTEN.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.348
"IF THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION
WERE CLEANSED,

12:28.348 --> 12:31.381
"EVERYTHING WOULD APPEAR
TO MAN AS IT IS,

12:31.381 --> 12:33.753
INFINITE."

12:33.753 --> 12:35.455
AND THAT APPLIES
TO YOU HOW?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.087
INFINITE FREEDOM.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.388
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

12:38.388 --> 12:40.791
I'M WEIGHED DOWN BY
MY FATHER'S EXPECTATIONS,

12:40.791 --> 12:43.193
MY MOTHER'S DISAPPROVING EYE,

12:43.193 --> 12:45.295
BUT MOSTLY
BY THE WORLD'S PERCEPTION

12:45.295 --> 12:47.537
OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A GRAYSON.

12:47.537 --> 12:49.239
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIMITED
BY ALL THAT

12:49.239 --> 12:51.241
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

12:51.241 --> 12:52.843
(indistinct conversations)

12:52.843 --> 12:54.204
(camera shutter clicks)

12:54.204 --> 12:56.246
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

12:56.246 --> 12:58.378
BEAUTIFUL. GREAT.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.310
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

13:00.310 --> 13:01.781
(clicking continues)

13:01.781 --> 13:04.554
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
THE MOMENT THAT...

13:04.554 --> 13:06.356
I KNEW YOU WERE THE ONE.

13:06.356 --> 13:09.289
(man) OH, THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.520
(woman) ♪ YOUR LOVE
IS GONNA SET ME FREE ♪

13:10.520 --> 13:12.092
DADDY.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.093
HEY.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.494
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.827
WELL, IT'S A FAMILY PORTRAIT,
ISN'T IT?

13:16.827 --> 13:18.829
YOU GUYS ARE SO PHOTOGENIC.
 AND THIS IS STILL MY FAMILY.

13:18.829 --> 13:20.470
HEY, I WANT TO TAKE
A PICTURE WITH DAD.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.472
GREAT.
 IN A MINUTE. I JUST NEED
TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.

13:22.472 --> 13:24.004
(Ashley) LET'S SET ONE UP
WITH CHARLOTTE AND HER FATHER.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.335
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

13:25.335 --> 13:26.877
(woman) PERFECT. THANKS.
 I'M GOING TO LUNCH.

13:26.877 --> 13:28.478
MOM, IF YOU'D STILL LIKE
TO JOIN ME AND DECLAN,

13:28.478 --> 13:30.510
I'D LOVE THAT.
 I WOULD BE DELIGHTED.

13:30.510 --> 13:34.044
(indistinct conversations)

13:34.044 --> 13:37.087
JOIN ME IN THE STUDY,
WOULD YOU?

13:37.087 --> 13:39.920
HOW ABOUT WE TRY ONE
OVER BY THE RAILING?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.822
HOW DARE YOU

13:42.822 --> 13:46.196
DRAG MY FATHER INTO THIS.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.398
I WAS SIMPLY TELLING HIM
ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

13:48.398 --> 13:49.900
OH, THE HELL YOU WERE.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.362
WE'LL SETTLE ALL OF THIS
TONIGHT AT DINNER.

13:52.362 --> 13:53.403
HE'LL BE HERE AT 8:00.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.105
WELL, I WON'T BE.

13:55.105 --> 13:56.536
OF COURSE YOU WILL.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.608
AND YOU WILL USE THIS EVENING
AS A PLATFORM

13:58.608 --> 14:01.511
TO SHOW THAT OUR SEPARATION
IS CIVIL AND FAIR,

14:01.511 --> 14:03.043
ENSURING
YOUR FATHER'S CONFIDENCE

14:03.043 --> 14:05.215
IN YOUR ONGOING LEADERSHIP
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL.

14:05.215 --> 14:06.546
OR?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.178
OR...

14:08.178 --> 14:09.619
I CAN MAKE IT
AN APOCALYPTIC SHOWCASE

14:09.619 --> 14:12.222
OF JUST HOW UGLY
THINGS HAVE BECOME

14:12.222 --> 14:13.523
AND HOW MUCH WORSE
THEY CAN GET.

14:13.523 --> 14:15.285
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
VICTORIA?

14:15.285 --> 14:17.227
I WANT YOU TO RESUME
ACTING LIKE

14:17.227 --> 14:19.589
A COMPASSIONATE FATHER
TO CHARLOTTE,

14:19.589 --> 14:23.133
TO AGREE NEVER TO REVEAL TO HER
HER TRUE PATERNITY,

14:23.133 --> 14:26.166
AND TO SETTLE THIS DIVORCE
FAIRLY AND OUT OF COURT.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.567
IS THAT ALL?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.070
FOR NOW.

14:31.241 --> 14:33.373
HEY, SKIPPER.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.405
WHAT YOU GOT?

14:35.405 --> 14:37.307
YOU'RE AN A.V. GEEK, RIGHT?

14:37.307 --> 14:38.478
MM-HMM.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.180
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.952
(indistinct conversations)

14:41.952 --> 14:43.383
WOW. (blows air)

14:43.383 --> 14:44.884
DINOSAUR FORMAT.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.516
WHAT DO I NEED
TO WATCH IT?

14:46.516 --> 14:48.318
(indistinct conversations
continue)

14:48.318 --> 14:50.590
WELL, WHY DON'T I JUST
TAKE IT BACK TO MY LAB?

14:50.590 --> 14:53.363
AND, UH, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

14:53.363 --> 14:56.366
I'LL HOLD ON TO THAT.

14:56.366 --> 14:57.897
JACK...

14:57.897 --> 15:00.100
YOU--YOU SEEM TIGHTLY WOUND.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.571
I MEAN, I CAN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE

15:01.571 --> 15:03.403
AMANDA'S NAME ON THAT.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.175
A SEX TAPE?

15:05.175 --> 15:08.078
NO. JUST FIND ME A PLAYER.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.482
(indistinct conversations)

15:12.482 --> 15:14.514
AS YOU KNOW, GRANDPA GRAYSON
IS IN TOWN,

15:14.514 --> 15:15.645
AND I WOULD LOVE
FOR THE TWO OF YOU

15:15.645 --> 15:17.347
TO JOIN US FOR DINNER
TONIGHT.

15:17.347 --> 15:18.918
I WOULD BE REMISS

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
IF I DIDN'T MENTION
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

15:20.920 --> 15:22.922
FOR ALL OF US,
DESPITE RECENT EVENTS,

15:22.922 --> 15:24.524
TO PUT FORTH OUR BEST EFFORT

15:24.524 --> 15:27.657
AND WELCOME HIM
INTO OUR HAPPY HOME.

15:27.657 --> 15:29.359
(chuckles)

15:29.359 --> 15:30.530
(sighs)

15:30.530 --> 15:32.002
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

15:32.002 --> 15:34.034
THAT LOOKED AN AWFUL LOT
LIKE MY MOTHER

15:34.034 --> 15:35.365
GETTING WHAT SHE WANTS.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.137
(cell phone rings)

15:37.137 --> 15:38.368
(ringing)

15:38.368 --> 15:39.669
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS NOLAN.

15:39.669 --> 15:41.371
I'VE BEEN PUTTING HIM OFF
ALL DAY. I'VE GOTTA GET IT.

15:41.371 --> 15:42.612
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GET CHANGED.

15:42.612 --> 15:43.974
OKAY.

15:43.974 --> 15:45.145
OKAY.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.576
ASHLEY, I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

15:46.576 --> 15:50.120
(ring)

15:50.120 --> 15:51.281
Did you find the tape?

15:51.281 --> 15:53.023
JACK WON'T LET IT
OUT OF HIS SIGHT.

15:53.023 --> 15:56.556
I COULD ERASE IT
IF I DIG UP MY DEGAUSSER.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.728
BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
HE WON'T WATCH IT

15:58.728 --> 16:01.061
before then.
 OKAY, DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER
THAT WAS ON THE TAPE?

16:01.061 --> 16:03.393
14. WHY?
YOU KNOW WHAT'S ON IT?

16:03.393 --> 16:06.496
THAT WAS MY INTERVIEW WITH
TREADWELL WHEN I WAS 10.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.338
I'VE GOTTA GET MY HANDS
ON THE TAPE.

16:08.338 --> 16:09.539
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

16:09.539 --> 16:12.442
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

16:12.442 --> 16:15.145
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO AVOID.

16:15.145 --> 16:16.446
(beeps)
 EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:16.446 --> 16:17.747
YEAH.

16:17.747 --> 16:19.449
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T HAPPY
WITH THAT PHOTO SHOOT.

16:19.449 --> 16:20.750
NO, IT W--IT'S NOT THAT.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.452
IT'S JUST... I DON'T KNOW.

16:22.452 --> 16:23.753
MAYBE TOMORROW,

16:23.753 --> 16:25.415
YOU, DANIEL, AND I CAN
GO OUT IN THE SUNLIGHT,

16:25.415 --> 16:27.757
DO SOMETHING
THAT'S A BIT MORE US.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.289
THAT WAS MY ORIGINAL CONCEPT.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.420
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS VICTORIA'S IDEA.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.262
YEAH, IT USUALLY IS.

16:32.262 --> 16:34.264
LISTEN, I HAVE A FEW THINGS
THAT I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

16:34.264 --> 16:35.565
WILL YOU TELL DANIEL
I HAD TO GO?

16:35.565 --> 16:37.327
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

16:37.327 --> 16:38.628
SECRET THINGS.

16:38.628 --> 16:40.330
(lowered voice)
WEDDING THINGS. (chuckles)

16:40.330 --> 16:41.431
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:41.431 --> 16:44.334
(telephone rings)

16:44.334 --> 16:46.476
(ring)

16:46.476 --> 16:48.478
HELLO.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.280
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
JACK.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.581
I NEED THAT TAPE BACK.

16:51.581 --> 16:54.344
THAT'S IT?

16:54.344 --> 16:56.646
That's all
you have to say to me?

16:56.646 --> 16:58.648
COASTAL INN, RIVERHEAD,

16:58.648 --> 17:00.190
room six.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.322
We'll talk
when you get here.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.022
BRING THAT TAPE.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.155
(beeps)

17:05.155 --> 17:06.796
(dial tone drones)

17:06.796 --> 17:08.458
(receiver clatters)

17:08.458 --> 17:10.500
(sighs)

17:20.609 --> 17:21.771
(Emily) I'M SORRY TO DRAG YOU
BACK INTO THIS.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.272
IT'S OKAY.

17:23.272 --> 17:26.516
I WAS GOING CRAZY, NOT BEING
ABLE TO TALK TO JACK.

17:26.516 --> 17:28.417
HOW IS HE?

17:28.417 --> 17:29.749
DOES HE MISS ME?

17:29.749 --> 17:33.353
(sighs) HE'S CONFUSED
AND UPSET BY WHAT HAPPENED,

17:33.353 --> 17:34.724
WHICH IS WHY
WE NEED TO STAY FOCUSED

17:34.724 --> 17:36.356
ON THE BIGGER PICTURE.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.159
WE CAN'T LET WHATEVER'S ON THAT
TAPE LEAD HIM TO VICTORIA.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.431
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF.
YOU'VE SEEN IT YOURSELF.

17:41.431 --> 17:43.233
ARE YOU SURE
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING?

17:43.233 --> 17:44.534
WHAT IF WE JUST
TELL JACK THE TRUTH?

17:44.534 --> 17:47.267
THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRETENDING
TO BE ME THIS WHOLE TIME?

17:47.267 --> 17:50.340
HE'D NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THAT.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.314
(indistinct conversations)

18:04.314 --> 18:05.385
THEY JUST CAME IN.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.486
HEY, WISH ME LUCK.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.520
MRS. G.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.692
THANK YOU
FOR HAVING ME, DECLAN.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.264
IT'S LIKE THE BEGINNING
OF A JOKE.

18:14.264 --> 18:15.525
TWO GRAYSONS
WALK INTO A BAR...

18:15.525 --> 18:17.427
WELL, PERHAPS WE SHOULD
HAVE A DRINK

18:17.427 --> 18:19.499
BEFORE I HEAR
THE PUNCH LINE. (laughs)

18:19.499 --> 18:21.501
DO YOU HAVE
A WINE LIST?

18:21.501 --> 18:24.834
WE DO. IT'S TWO WINES LONG.
RED OR WHITE.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.236
(laughs)

18:26.236 --> 18:28.278
HOW ABOUT
A BOURBON ON THE ROCKS?

18:28.278 --> 18:29.839
YEAH, I'LL PUT
THAT ORDER IN WITH BULL.

18:29.839 --> 18:31.211
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.543
UH, THIS IS WEIRD
FOR YOU, ISN'T IT?

18:33.543 --> 18:34.844
WELL, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THERE'S MORE TO ME

18:34.844 --> 18:36.516
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.688
BESIDES,
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

18:38.688 --> 18:42.392
TO SHAKE UP ONE'S PERSPECTIVE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

18:42.392 --> 18:43.653
THAT'S WHY I'M INTERESTED
IN YOURS.

18:43.653 --> 18:45.555
GOOD. WELL, THEN CAN I
INVITE DECLAN

18:45.555 --> 18:47.497
TO DINNER WITH GRANDPA
TONIGHT?

18:47.497 --> 18:49.659
SWEETHEART,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

18:49.659 --> 18:51.601
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO YOUR FATHER

18:51.601 --> 18:53.303
THAT THE EVENING
GO WITHOUT A HITCH.

18:53.303 --> 18:54.664
DAD CAN HARDLY
FORCE A SMILE LONG ENOUGH

18:54.664 --> 18:56.636
TO TAKE A PICTURE
WITH ME.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.469
HE'LL BEHAVE.
I SPOKE TO HIM.

18:59.469 --> 19:01.171
(knock on door)

19:01.171 --> 19:03.142
IT'S OPEN.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.575
(door opens and closes)

19:07.617 --> 19:08.848
AH...

19:08.848 --> 19:11.821
IT'S VICTORIA'S
PET BIRD.

19:11.821 --> 19:13.823
SHE WANTED TO ME TO PICK UP
YOUR LIST OF INVITES

19:13.823 --> 19:15.525
FOR FIRE & ICE.

19:15.525 --> 19:18.488
OH, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S INCOMPLETE.

19:18.488 --> 19:20.560
MY SECRETARY IS STILL WORKING
ON THE CROSSOVER

19:20.560 --> 19:22.662
AS VICTORIA AND I
ARE STILL

19:22.662 --> 19:24.494
SOCIALLY INTERTWINED.

19:24.494 --> 19:27.497
OKAY. I'LL LET
MRS. GRAYSON KNOW.

19:28.598 --> 19:31.241
WHAT'S YOUR GAME,
YOUNG LADY?

19:32.902 --> 19:34.604
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

19:34.604 --> 19:36.506
WELL, YOU'RE TOO REFINED
TO BE A GRIFTER

19:36.506 --> 19:38.608
AND YOU'RE TOO SMART
TO BE A LACKEY.

19:38.608 --> 19:41.951
SO I SUPPOSE
THE POLITE WORD FOR IT

19:41.951 --> 19:43.953
WOULD BE OPPORTUNIST.

19:43.953 --> 19:45.955
SO IF IT'S OPPORTUNITY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

19:45.955 --> 19:48.488
YOU'RE HITCHING YOUR WAGON
TO THE WRONG GRAYSON.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.261
OH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT
HOW VICTORIA TREATS HER HELP.

19:51.261 --> 19:53.663
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
SHE KEEPS YOU AT BAY

19:53.663 --> 19:55.895
AND THEN SHE DRAWS YOU IN,
GIVES YOU PROMISES,

19:55.895 --> 20:00.530
AND AS SOON AS YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA LET YOU FLY,

20:00.530 --> 20:02.972
SHE CLIPS YOUR WINGS
AND PUTS YOU BACK IN YOUR CAGE.

20:02.972 --> 20:04.574
I WOULDN'T SETTLE FOR THAT

20:04.574 --> 20:07.507
IF I WERE YOU.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.639
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE YOUR SECRETARY

20:09.639 --> 20:14.444
E-MAIL ME THE LIST
WHEN YOU'RE READY, MR. GRAYSON?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.687
(door opens)

20:23.222 --> 20:24.824
(lock clicks)

20:27.727 --> 20:29.629
DID YOU BRING THE TAPE?

20:29.629 --> 20:31.631
HI TO YOU, TOO.

20:33.303 --> 20:34.634
AMANDA--
 DID YOU WATCH IT?

20:36.766 --> 20:38.568
(bangs)

20:38.568 --> 20:40.670
DO I NEED TO?

20:40.670 --> 20:43.273
DON'T I ALREADY KNOW
EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW?

20:43.273 --> 20:44.614
SOME GUY'S HOUSE BURNS DOWN,

20:44.614 --> 20:45.915
ANOTHER GUY COMES LOOKING
FOR HIS STOLEN PROPERTY,

20:45.915 --> 20:48.548
WHICH I FIND IN MY HOUSE,
LEFT BY YOU,

20:48.548 --> 20:50.620
AND I'M NEARLY BEATEN
TO DEATH FOR IT.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.581
(pants)

20:51.581 --> 20:53.483
WAS I JUST YOUR ALIBI?

20:53.483 --> 20:55.325
THAT SPONTANEOUS TRIP
TO ATLANTIC CITY,

20:55.325 --> 20:57.557
SUGGESTED BY YOU, WAS THAT
NOT-SO-SPONTANEOUS AFTER ALL?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.489
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, JACK?

20:59.489 --> 21:00.930
I DID IT.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.533
I'M A THIEF, AN ARSONIST,
AND NOW A FUGITIVE,

21:03.533 --> 21:06.396
SO CALL THE COPS IF YOU WANT,
JUST GIVE ME THE TAPE BACK.

21:06.396 --> 21:09.268
NOT UNTIL
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.671
WHY'D YOU COME BACK HERE?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.803
LOOK AT ME.
 (sniffles)

21:13.803 --> 21:15.675
WAS IT FOR ME?

21:15.675 --> 21:17.807
WAS IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

21:17.807 --> 21:19.509
YOU WANT
THE WHOLE TRUTH, JACK?

21:19.509 --> 21:21.681
YEAH.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.314
THE TRUTH IS,
I'VE MADE MISTAKES.

21:24.314 --> 21:26.556
I'VE PRETENDED TO BE
SOMETHING I'M NOT.

21:26.556 --> 21:28.718
(voice breaking) AND THAT
LITTLE GIRL YOU LOVED,

21:28.718 --> 21:30.760
SHE'S NOT ME.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.823
JUST GIVE ME THE TAPE BACK.

21:35.565 --> 21:36.766
NO.

21:36.766 --> 21:37.727
(sniffles)

21:37.727 --> 21:39.429
NO, I'M KEEPING IT.

21:39.429 --> 21:40.730
I WANT TO SEE WHAT WAS WORTH

21:40.730 --> 21:42.802
THROWING EVERYTHING
WE HAD AWAY.

21:45.735 --> 21:47.637
(cries) J--

21:49.839 --> 21:51.981
(crying)

21:51.981 --> 21:53.713
YOU NEED TO GO AFTER HIM.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.445
NO!

21:55.445 --> 21:56.786
I DON'T CARE
WHAT'S ON THAT TAPE,

21:56.786 --> 21:57.887
I'M NOT DOING THAT
TO HIM AGAIN.

21:57.887 --> 21:59.088
WE'RE DOING IT
 FOR HIM--

21:59.088 --> 22:00.990
SO YOU KEEP SAYING.

22:00.990 --> 22:02.352
AMANDA--

22:02.352 --> 22:03.693
STOP CALLING ME THAT.

22:03.693 --> 22:06.526
YOU WANT THAT TAPE SO BAD,
YOU GET IT FROM HIM.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.362
(Emily) I NEED YOU
TO CALL JACK AND TELL HIM

22:12.362 --> 22:13.533
YOU FOUND THE EQUIPMENT
TO VIEW THAT VIDEO.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.704
HE WOULDN'T GIVE IT BACK
TO AMANDA.

22:14.704 --> 22:15.765
POOR JACK MUST REALLY
WANT ANSWERS

22:15.765 --> 22:17.637
IF NOT EVEN
THE LONG ISLAND LOLITA

22:17.637 --> 22:19.038
COULD PRY THAT TAPE
FROM HIS DEATH GRIP.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.040
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
EXACTLY WHAT'S ON IT.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.412
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

22:22.412 --> 22:23.943
ALL JACK'S GONNA SEE
IS SNOW, RIGHT?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.475
IS THIS THE DEGAUSSER?

22:25.475 --> 22:27.116
LOCKED AND READY
TO BE LOADED.

22:27.116 --> 22:29.879
IT'LL ERASE
ANY MAGNETIC RECORDING.

22:29.879 --> 22:31.681
THOUGH, WHY NOT JUST
LET HIM SEE THE TAPE?

22:31.681 --> 22:33.683
SERIOUSLY, EMS.

22:33.683 --> 22:35.354
I MEAN, GIVE THE POOR GUY
SOME CLOSURE

22:35.354 --> 22:37.587
AS TO WHY AMANDA CLARKE
ADDED CRIMINAL PYROMANIA

22:37.587 --> 22:39.759
TO HER ALREADY IMPRESSIVE
LIST OF FELONIES.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.592
BECAUSE THE ONLY MEMORY JACK
SHOULD HAVE OF AMANDA CLARKE

22:42.592 --> 22:44.594
IS THE GIRL
THAT I LEFT BEHIND.

22:44.594 --> 22:48.438
IS THAT SO HE CAN MOVE ON...

22:48.438 --> 22:50.139
OR SO YOU CAN?

22:50.139 --> 22:51.701
NEVER MIND.

22:51.701 --> 22:54.043
(exhales)

22:54.043 --> 22:57.146
WHAT'S ON THE REVENGENDA
THIS EVENING, HMM?

22:57.146 --> 22:59.709
DINNER WITH DANIEL'S
GRANDFATHER.

22:59.709 --> 23:01.551
I HEAR THERE'S NOTHING

23:01.551 --> 23:03.583
GRANDPA GRAYSON LIKES LESS
THAN A SCANDAL.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.586
VICTORIA USED
MY FATHER'S REPUTATION

23:06.586 --> 23:09.489
TO EXPLAIN AWAY
CHARLOTTE'S EXISTENCE.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.422
TONIGHT I'M PITTING
HER OWN LIES AGAINST HER.

23:12.422 --> 23:14.524
FORGIVE ME FOR BEING
CAPTAIN OBVIOUS,

23:14.524 --> 23:16.666
BUT, UH, YOU DO REALIZE,

23:16.666 --> 23:20.700
YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR OWN SISTER
INTO THE CROSSHAIRS AGAIN?

23:20.700 --> 23:22.772
CHARLOTTE DESERVES
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

23:24.474 --> 23:26.906
THE QUESTION IS...

23:26.906 --> 23:28.678
WHO'S GONNA TELL HER?

23:28.678 --> 23:31.040
THAT'S SIMPLE.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.743
OUR FATHER IS.

23:33.743 --> 23:35.645
(piano jazz music playing)

23:35.645 --> 23:37.146
(doorbell rings)

23:37.146 --> 23:38.888
HI.

23:38.888 --> 23:40.820
HELLO.
 OH.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.522
THERE'S A PACKAGE
IN THE DOORWAY.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.723
THANK YOU.

23:43.723 --> 23:47.026
(music continues)

23:48.598 --> 23:49.899
HEY, BABE.

23:49.899 --> 23:51.661
HOW WERE
YOUR SECRET ERRANDS?

23:51.661 --> 23:52.962
ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

23:52.962 --> 23:54.934
COME ON. I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY GRANDFATHER.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.906
OKAY.

23:56.906 --> 24:00.439
(music continues)

24:00.439 --> 24:01.811
(Declan) WELL, ACTUALLY,
ME AND MY BROTHER OWN A BAR

24:01.811 --> 24:02.772
IN MONTAUK.

24:02.772 --> 24:04.814
BEST BARFLIES
IN THE HAMPTONS, HANDS DOWN.

24:04.814 --> 24:06.716
HELLO, DAD.

24:06.716 --> 24:08.648
THERE'S MY GIRL.
 (laughs)

24:08.648 --> 24:10.179
(laughs)
 OH.

24:10.179 --> 24:11.681
DON'T YOU LOOK WELL?

24:11.681 --> 24:13.823
YOU'RE LYING YOUR ASS OFF,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

24:13.823 --> 24:16.656
(chuckles) I SEE
THAT YOU'VE MET DECLAN.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.758
HE'S GOING TO BE ATTENDING
COLLINS PREP

24:18.758 --> 24:20.560
WITH CHARLOTTE THIS FALL.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.861
WELL, THAT'S ASSUMING
I PASS THE ENTRANCE EXAMS.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.563
AND I BEEN WORKING LIKE A DOG,
BUT THEY'RE, UH--

24:23.563 --> 24:24.764
THEY'RE A BITCH.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.736
YES, SIR.
 (laughs)

24:26.736 --> 24:28.037
(Grandpa chuckles)
 THANK YOU.

24:28.037 --> 24:30.770
LISTEN, I NEVER MADE IT
PAST THE 11th GRADE.

24:30.770 --> 24:35.805
BUT I STARTED GRAYSON GLOBAL
FROM THE GROUND UP AT 22.

24:35.805 --> 24:37.547
DON'T EVER LET
THE PLACE YOU START

24:37.547 --> 24:39.148
DICTATE WHERE YOU FINISH.

24:39.148 --> 24:40.680
RIGHT, VICTORIA?

24:40.680 --> 24:42.852
NEVER. (chuckles)

24:42.852 --> 24:44.514
EMILY.

24:44.514 --> 24:46.015
EMILY, THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER,
EDWARD GRAYSON.

24:46.015 --> 24:47.887
IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.789
DANIEL'S TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.891
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.222
(Victoria laughs)

24:53.222 --> 24:55.064
WELL, IN OUR DEFENSE,
THIS COURTSHIP

24:55.064 --> 24:57.226
PRACTICALLY MATERIALIZED
OUT OF THIN AIR.

24:57.226 --> 25:01.070
SO HOW DID YOU TWO
LOVE BIRDS MEET?

25:01.070 --> 25:04.203
HEY, STUDYBUG.
SETTLE AN ARGUMENT FOR US.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.705
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THIS MAN IS?

25:05.705 --> 25:06.936
NOPE.

25:06.936 --> 25:09.809
HE IS POISED TO BE ONE OF
THE RICHEST MEN IN AMERICA.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.080
WOW.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.512
BUT HE WANTS TO THROW
ALL THAT AWAY AND BECOME

25:13.512 --> 25:14.814
A PENNILESS POET.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.946
NOW I THINK HE'S CRAZY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:16.946 --> 25:18.618
(Boston accent) I THINK
YOU SHOULD ASK SOMEONE ELSE.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.919
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WE WANT TO ASK YOU.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.991
I MEAN, I CAN'T BE WHO I AM
AND A POET AT THE SAME TIME.

25:21.991 --> 25:24.253
MY PARENTS
WOULD NEVER ALLOW IT.
 (laughs)

25:24.253 --> 25:25.895
YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT

25:25.895 --> 25:27.727
WHEN THEY HEAR
YOUR LAST NAME?

25:27.727 --> 25:28.998
MAKE 'EM SEE IT.

25:28.998 --> 25:30.960
BE BETTER
THAN YOUR PARENTS.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.302
THERE AIN'T NOTHIN'
MORE POETIC THAN THAT.

25:33.302 --> 25:35.264
(piano jazz music playing)

25:35.264 --> 25:37.937
DANIEL STRIKES ME AS A MAN
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.839
BE WILLING
TO MAKE A DECISION.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.941
THAT'S WHAT PATTON SAID

25:41.941 --> 25:43.773
WAS THE SIGN
OF A TRUE LEADER.

25:43.773 --> 25:44.944
(Conrad) EVENING, ALL.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.976
SORRY I'M LATE.
I GOT HELD UP AT WORK.

25:46.976 --> 25:49.278
(Edward) STILL KISSING UP
TO THE BOSS

25:49.278 --> 25:51.150
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, HEY?
 (cell phone ringing)

25:51.150 --> 25:52.852
YEAH, WELL, IT SEEMS
A C.E.O.'s WORK

25:52.852 --> 25:54.023
IS NEVER DONE.

25:54.023 --> 25:55.955
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.887
CHARLOTTE, WOULD YOU JOIN ME
IN THE STUDY, PLEASE?

25:57.887 --> 26:01.831
(music continues)

26:01.831 --> 26:03.162
HOW ABOUT A DANCE?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.333
(Victoria) I'D LOVE THAT.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.695
YOU OKAY WITH THIS,
CHAR?

26:05.695 --> 26:07.637
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND,
DECLAN.

26:07.637 --> 26:08.868
I LOVE YOU.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.042
(Edward)
LEVEL WITH ME, VICKY.

26:13.042 --> 26:15.845
YOU THINK THIS MARRIAGE
CAN BE SAVED?

26:15.845 --> 26:17.947
COME ON, DAD.

26:17.947 --> 26:21.110
YOU CAN HARDLY
BE SURPRISED.

26:21.110 --> 26:23.983
BESIDES, YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS
SPOKEN THE SAME LANGUAGE.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.285
I'VE LOVED A LOT OF WOMEN
IN MY LIFE,

26:26.285 --> 26:28.287
BUT I NEVER COULD
FIGURE OUT

26:28.287 --> 26:30.289
HOW TO MAKE IT LAST.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.961
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU LOVED

26:31.961 --> 26:33.723
TOO MANY AT THE SAME TIME.

26:33.723 --> 26:35.995
(laughs) FAIR ENOUGH.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.828
BUT I'M 80 NOW...

26:38.828 --> 26:40.970
WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.

26:40.970 --> 26:44.003
I DON'T WANT THE SAME FATE
FOR YOU AND CONRAD.

26:44.003 --> 26:47.006
OH, NEITHER DO I.

26:47.006 --> 26:51.881
PROMISE ME THAT THIS IS NOT
GONNA GET UGLY.

26:51.881 --> 26:53.683
HMM?

26:53.683 --> 26:56.385
HERE'S AMANDA'S TAPE.

26:56.385 --> 26:58.147
THANKS, MAN.

26:58.147 --> 27:00.149
I COULDN'T HAVE GONE TO
ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS.

27:00.149 --> 27:02.952
WELL... LUCKY FOR YOU,
YOU GOT

27:02.952 --> 27:05.925
THE CAPTAIN OF THE GEEK SQUAD
IN YOUR BACK POCKET.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.728
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING, NOLAN.

27:08.728 --> 27:11.861
YOU'VE BEEN
A REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

27:13.102 --> 27:16.035
(exhales deeply)
PROBABLY ONE OF MY ONLY.

27:20.770 --> 27:23.012
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING,

27:23.012 --> 27:24.944
FRIEND TO FRIEND?

27:24.944 --> 27:27.046
SHOOT.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.378
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO WATCH THIS?

27:29.378 --> 27:30.880
I MEAN, IF AMANDA
ALREADY ADMITTED

27:30.880 --> 27:33.683
THAT SHE SET THE FIRE,
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

27:33.683 --> 27:35.885
BECAUSE THE REALITY CAN'T BE
ANY WORSE THAN MY IMAGINATION.

27:35.885 --> 27:37.026
WHAT IF IT IS?

27:37.026 --> 27:39.388
EITHER WAY,
I GOTTA KNOW.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.092
IF I'M GONNA LET HER GO,

27:43.092 --> 27:44.994
I HAVE TO.

27:49.238 --> 27:51.741
(exhales deeply)

27:58.007 --> 28:01.680
(whirring)

28:01.680 --> 28:04.914
(Amanda) PLEASE.
I NEED TO TALK TO MY DADDY.

28:04.914 --> 28:06.756
FIND THE LADY
WITH THE DARK HAIR.

28:06.756 --> 28:10.089
SHE WAS THERE THE NIGHT
THEY TOOK HIM AWAY.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.361
HE LOVED HER.

28:12.361 --> 28:15.064
AND SHE LOVED HIM.

28:15.064 --> 28:17.997
THEY KISSED ON THE LIPS
ALL THE TIME.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.069
JUST FIND HER.

28:20.069 --> 28:22.301
I KNOW SHE'LL HELP US.

28:22.301 --> 28:26.205
(Mason) DO YOU KNOW
THE NAME OF THIS WOMAN?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.778
VICTORIA.

28:28.778 --> 28:30.009
PLEASE.

28:30.009 --> 28:33.913
I HAVE TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.446
(clicks button)

28:37.446 --> 28:39.288
(player whirs)

28:39.288 --> 28:42.021
POOR KID.

28:42.021 --> 28:45.925
JACK, I'M SO SORRY.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.456
YEAH.

28:47.456 --> 28:50.129
YEAH, ME, TOO.

29:07.376 --> 29:09.849
CHARLOTTE...

29:09.849 --> 29:12.351
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

29:13.823 --> 29:15.054
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING

29:15.054 --> 29:17.987
WITH THIS FAMILY
IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

29:17.987 --> 29:20.830
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
MY FRUSTRATIONS WITH YOUR MOTHER

29:20.830 --> 29:23.032
OUT ON YOU.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.136
SO I HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG?

29:27.136 --> 29:28.868
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.339
NO.

29:30.339 --> 29:33.242
IF I SEEM TOUGH,
CHARLOTTE,

29:33.242 --> 29:34.944
IT'S BECAUSE I WANT YOU
STRONG ENOUGH

29:34.944 --> 29:37.106
TO HANDLE
WHATEVER INSTABILITIES

29:37.106 --> 29:40.379
MAY COME YOUR WAY.

29:43.112 --> 29:45.784
DADDY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN JUSTIN FOWLER

29:45.784 --> 29:48.958
BROKE UP WITH ME
AT MY SWEET 16 PARTY?

29:48.958 --> 29:52.161
YEAH. SURE.

29:52.161 --> 29:53.893
HE WAS YOUR FIRST LOVE.

29:57.126 --> 30:00.329
AND YOU SAT WITH ME
FOR TWO HOURS

30:00.329 --> 30:02.801
WHEN MY FRIENDS
WERE DOWNSTAIRS,

30:02.801 --> 30:04.403
WONDERING WHERE I'D GONE.

30:06.135 --> 30:07.806
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID?

30:09.909 --> 30:12.041
LET 'EM WAIT.

30:13.482 --> 30:17.086
AND YOU SAT WITH ME,
MAKING ME LAUGH.

30:17.086 --> 30:19.048
(chuckles)

30:19.048 --> 30:22.021
YOU KNOW,
THAT LAUGH OF YOURS

30:22.021 --> 30:24.123
IS PROBABLY
MY MOST FAVORITE SOUND

30:24.123 --> 30:27.526
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.199
(chuckles)

30:35.064 --> 30:39.008
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF INSTABILITY, DADDY.

30:39.008 --> 30:41.010
AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU,

30:41.010 --> 30:43.242
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN'T HANDLE.

30:45.014 --> 30:47.016
HEY.

30:49.318 --> 30:51.380
COME HERE.

30:57.626 --> 31:00.229
THERE'S MY GIRL.

31:15.604 --> 31:18.207
EMILY.

31:18.207 --> 31:19.308
DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

31:19.308 --> 31:21.280
WHY DON'T YOU COME JOIN
THE OTHERS ON THE PATIO?

31:24.954 --> 31:27.316
THIS IS JUST A DVD
FROM ANOTHER WEDDING PLANNER.

31:27.316 --> 31:30.059
I WOULDN'T WANT ASHLEY
TO GET THE WRONG IDEA.

31:30.059 --> 31:32.191
WELL,
THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.263
(pounding on door)

31:34.263 --> 31:36.265
AMANDA!

31:38.067 --> 31:40.069
AMANDA, OPEN THE DOOR.

31:41.570 --> 31:44.373
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.
PLEASE...

31:44.373 --> 31:47.206
JUST TALK TO ME.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.907
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU PUSHED ME AWAY,

31:48.907 --> 31:51.580
AND I DON'T CARE.
I JUST WANT TO HELP YOU.

31:52.982 --> 31:54.583
I SAW THE TAPE.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.285
I KNOW WHAT VICTORIA
DID TO YOU.

31:56.285 --> 31:57.586
I KNOW SHE LEFT YOU
IN THAT AWFUL PLACE.

31:57.586 --> 32:00.219
I PROBABLY WOULD'VE BURNED
THAT HOUSE DOWN MYSELF.

32:01.550 --> 32:04.293
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR.

32:04.293 --> 32:05.624
(bangs)

32:07.156 --> 32:09.258
(banging)

32:09.258 --> 32:12.301
AMANDA! ARE YOU IN THERE?!
 (cell phone beeps)

32:12.301 --> 32:13.432
PLEASE JUST TALK TO ME.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.603
(phone rings)

32:14.603 --> 32:16.335
(bang)

32:18.137 --> 32:19.268
(cell phone rings)

32:19.268 --> 32:21.170
(ring)

32:21.170 --> 32:22.711
(ring)

32:22.711 --> 32:25.474
EXCUSE ME. THIS IS ONE OF
THE FOUNDATIONS I WORK FOR.

32:25.474 --> 32:26.645
(ring)

32:26.645 --> 32:28.217
(beeps)

32:28.217 --> 32:29.378
(lowered voice) AMANDA.

32:29.378 --> 32:31.080
IF YOU WERE GONNA LET JACK
WATCH THE TAPE,

32:31.080 --> 32:32.251
WHY'D YOU MAKE ME
PUSH HIM AWAY?

32:32.251 --> 32:34.053
I DIDN'T LET HIM WATCH IT.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.354
Somebody did.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.485
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

32:36.485 --> 32:38.087
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST HERE.

32:38.087 --> 32:39.989
HE NEARLY BROKE THE DOOR DOWN.
 AMANDA, LISTEN TO ME--

32:39.989 --> 32:42.961
NO, I'M DONE LISTENING TO YOU.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.263
I'M GONNA START LISTENING
TO JACK NOW.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.964
I'M GOING AFTER HIM.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.136
AMANDA--

32:47.136 --> 32:48.437
MODERN TECHNOLOGY...

32:48.437 --> 32:50.139
IT'S GONNA BE THE DEATH
OF US ALL.

32:50.139 --> 32:52.101
COME ON. JOIN THE PARTY.

32:52.101 --> 32:53.502
(tires squeal)
 JACK!

32:53.502 --> 32:55.404
JACK! JACK!

32:55.404 --> 32:57.506
JACK!

32:57.506 --> 33:00.409
JACK! (pants)

33:04.483 --> 33:05.584
(Daniel) AND THE RAIN
WAS POURING DOWN ON US,

33:05.584 --> 33:06.755
BUT I JUST KEPT GOING.

33:06.755 --> 33:08.357
AND, UH, AND SOMEHOW,

33:08.357 --> 33:10.589
SHE FOUND IT IN HER HEART
TO SAY YES.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.521
THAT'S GREAT.

33:12.521 --> 33:15.494
AND DANIEL TELLS ME
YOU'RE INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.695
HERE'S TO SMALL MIRACLES.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.467
(Daniel) SHE STUDIES CULTURES
ALL AROUND THE WORLD,

33:18.467 --> 33:19.768
SPEAKS
SEVERAL DIFFERENT LANGUAGES,

33:19.768 --> 33:21.400
DEVOTES HER TIME TO CHARITY.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.531
(knock on door)
 WELL...

33:22.531 --> 33:24.303
SHE'S PRETTY SPECIAL.
 (chuckles)

33:24.303 --> 33:25.474
(woman speaks indistinctly)

33:25.474 --> 33:27.036
BEAUTY, BRAINS,
AND A BIG HEART TO BOOT.

33:27.036 --> 33:29.638
YOU KNOW WHO YOU
REMIND ME OF?
 (door opens)

33:29.638 --> 33:31.040
VICTORIA.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.311
(chuckles)

33:32.311 --> 33:33.782
HMM.

33:33.782 --> 33:36.685
DON'T YOU ALL SEE
THE RESEMBLANCE?
 (door closes)

33:36.685 --> 33:38.317
(woman) SIR.
EXCUSE ME. SIR.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.688
YOU COULDN'T DO IT.

33:39.688 --> 33:41.590
YOU COULDN'T JUST LEAVE HER
THE HELL ALONE.

33:41.590 --> 33:43.052
JACK, I-I--
 (woman speaks indistinctly)

33:43.052 --> 33:44.523
EXCUSE ME, PORTER,
WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE

33:44.523 --> 33:46.024
OF A FAMILY DINNER HERE, SO--
 BACK OFF, GRAYSON.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.256
I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU.

33:47.256 --> 33:48.697
WELL, IF YOU'RE HERE
FOR EMILY,

33:48.697 --> 33:50.359
I'M SURE SHE MADE IT CLEAR,
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

33:50.359 --> 33:51.700
DON'T PUSH ME.
 ENOUGH!

33:51.700 --> 33:53.262
(Declan whispers) STOP IT.

33:53.262 --> 33:54.563
MR. PORTER, YOU HAVE
SOME NERVE COMING HERE.

33:54.563 --> 33:55.664
I'VE GOT SOME NERVE?

33:55.664 --> 33:56.805
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO AMANDA CLARKE

33:56.805 --> 33:58.337
TO MAKE HER LEAVE TOWN?

33:58.337 --> 33:59.508
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

33:59.508 --> 34:01.610
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'VE BEEN MISINFORMED.

34:01.610 --> 34:03.272
AS MISINFORMED
AS DAVID CLARKE WAS

34:03.272 --> 34:05.544
WHEN AMANDA SAW YOU
KISSING HIM?

34:08.476 --> 34:11.350
MOM,
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

34:11.350 --> 34:14.123
I KNOW. I KNOW YOU WERE
IN LOVE WITH AMANDA'S FATHER.

34:14.123 --> 34:15.583
BUT I GUESS
IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT

34:15.583 --> 34:16.824
TO HIDE THAT FROM THE WORLD
THAN TO HELP THE LITTLE GIRL

34:16.824 --> 34:18.127
THAT HE LEFT BEHIND.

34:18.127 --> 34:20.259
YOU HAVE
AN ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.431
WHO NEEDS IMAGINATION?

34:22.431 --> 34:25.434
I'VE SEEN THE VIDEOTAPE.

34:27.136 --> 34:29.797
IT'S NO WONDER HER LIFE
TURNED OUT AS ROUGH AS IT DID.

34:29.797 --> 34:32.841
BUT YOU COULD'VE PREVENTED THAT,
AND YOU DID NOTHING.

34:32.841 --> 34:35.103
NOTHING.

34:35.103 --> 34:37.376
IF YOU DON'T STOP TELLING LIES
ABOUT AMANDA CLARKE,

34:37.376 --> 34:39.277
I'M GONNA START TELLING
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU.

34:43.612 --> 34:45.813
JACK. HEY, WAIT UP.

34:45.813 --> 34:48.117
VICTORIA,
IS THIS TRUE?

34:48.117 --> 34:49.558
(Daniel)
LISTEN, HE DOESN'T KNOW

34:49.558 --> 34:51.089
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
WITH DAVID CLARKE.
 (door opens)

34:51.089 --> 34:55.264
MURDER AND TERRORISM
WEREN'T HIS ONLY CRIMES.

34:55.264 --> 34:57.126
WHAT HAPPENED
WASN'T MOM'S FAULT.
 (door closes)

34:57.126 --> 35:00.269
IS THAT THE STORY
YOU'RE SPINNING THESE DAYS?

35:00.269 --> 35:02.701
ASTONISHING,
THE LENGTHS YOU'LL GO TO

35:02.701 --> 35:03.672
FOR SELF-PRESERVATION.

35:03.672 --> 35:05.774
NOT ANOTHER WORD,
CONRAD.

35:05.774 --> 35:07.376
I AM WARNING YOU.

35:07.376 --> 35:08.707
SHE'S RIGHT.
CHARLOTTE DOESN'T DESERVE

35:08.707 --> 35:10.108
TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.780
NO, SHE DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

35:11.780 --> 35:13.282
BUT SHE'S RIGHT
IN THE CENTER OF IT.

35:13.282 --> 35:14.783
AND SHE HAS YOUR MOTHER
TO THANK FOR THAT.

35:14.783 --> 35:16.445
SOMEBODY BETTER TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW

35:16.445 --> 35:17.686
OR I SWEAR--
 CHARLOTTE, SWEETHEART,

35:17.686 --> 35:20.619
YOU SAID THAT YOU COULD HANDLE
ANYTHING AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ME.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.452
WELL, YOU HAVE ME, ALWAYS.

35:23.452 --> 35:25.624
AND IT'S TIME
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.126
DAVID CLARKE ISN'T JUST
AMANDA'S FATHER.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.700
HE'S YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER
AS WELL.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.567
NO.

35:38.567 --> 35:40.569
HE'S NOT.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.672
MOM...

35:50.679 --> 35:51.750
CHARLOTTE!

35:55.584 --> 35:58.827
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THIS.
 (door closes)

35:58.827 --> 36:01.360
AND I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR INVITING THAT BASTARD

36:01.360 --> 36:03.432
INTO OUR BED.
 (Daniel)
SHE DIDN'T INVITE HIM, DAD.

36:03.432 --> 36:04.593
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

36:04.593 --> 36:06.335
NO, NO, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED, DANIEL.

36:06.335 --> 36:08.497
WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU KNOW,
THAT MAN

36:08.497 --> 36:10.699
NEVER ATTACKED YOUR MOTHER.

36:10.699 --> 36:12.671
NO.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.904
AND IT WASN'T
JUST ONE NIGHT.

36:15.904 --> 36:19.248
IT WAS AN ONGOING AFFAIR.

36:19.248 --> 36:22.811
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.
MOM, TELL HIM.

36:22.811 --> 36:24.953
MOM, TELL HIM.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.789
(exhales)

36:45.474 --> 36:46.905
SO MUCH FOR THE POSSIBILITY
OF A FRIENDLY DIVORCE.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.778
WELL, SHE'LL SETTLE QUIETLY.
I'M MAKING SURE OF THAT.

36:49.778 --> 36:52.811
DO I HAVE TO REMIND YOU
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS COMPANY

36:52.811 --> 36:55.284
THE LAST TIME
DAVID CLARKE'S NAME

36:55.284 --> 36:56.945
WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IT?

36:56.945 --> 36:58.647
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
LIKE I'M THE ONE

36:58.647 --> 36:59.948
WHO SLEPT WITH HIM?

36:59.948 --> 37:02.591
SHE DID THIS TO OUR FAMILY,
WILLINGLY.

37:02.591 --> 37:05.254
I AM LESS CONCERNED
ABOUT HER SINS AS A WIFE

37:05.254 --> 37:08.226
THAN I AM ABOUT YOUR SINS
AS A FATHER.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.828
WHAT KIND OF A MAN

37:09.828 --> 37:11.830
FORCES HIS CHILDREN
TO PARTICIPATE

37:11.830 --> 37:13.832
IN A CHARADE LIKE THIS?

37:13.832 --> 37:16.535
YOU DID WHEN YOU TAUGHT ME
THAT PERCEPTION IS REALITY!

37:16.535 --> 37:18.807
IN BUSINESS, CONRAD!

37:18.807 --> 37:20.539
THIS IS FAMILY.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.811
IT'S THE SAME DIFFERENCE,
ISN'T IT?

37:25.444 --> 37:28.477
IF THAT IS ALL
I PASSED ON TO YOU,

37:28.477 --> 37:31.880
THEN YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
WHY I AM SUGGESTING

37:31.880 --> 37:36.355
THAT YOU STEP DOWN AS C.E.O.
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL,

37:36.355 --> 37:39.588
AND WE BEGIN TO GROOM YOUR SON
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE.

37:39.588 --> 37:42.431
