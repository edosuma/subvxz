♪♪

00:04.960 --> 00:07.880
Crime in San Fransokyo,
at an all-time low,

00:07.880 --> 00:09.250
according to a new study
released today

00:09.250 --> 00:10.960
by the Department
of New Studies.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.000
Thank you, Big Hero 6.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.620
Since there's nothing else
going on, today we begin
a 12-part series

00:16.620 --> 00:19.210
on "Foods I Don't Care For."

00:19.210 --> 00:21.620
Part one: Yams.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.920
The yam
has a high amount
of vitamin B5,

00:24.920 --> 00:27.120
C, and nutritional fiber.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.290
Hiro?

00:31.250 --> 00:33.170
Hiro?

00:33.170 --> 00:34.170
Hiro?

00:35.790 --> 00:37.120
-(louder) Hiro!
-Aah!

00:37.120 --> 00:39.040
Has your hearing
become impaired?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.210
Can you hear me now?

00:40.210 --> 00:42.880
Uh, sorry, Baymax.
I was just distracted.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.210
I know this is
all connected.

00:45.210 --> 00:49.330
Like this painting.
I bet Globby stole it
for Obake. But why?

00:49.330 --> 00:52.620
Obake's planning something big.
I've gotta figure this out.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.830
-Nothing's more important.
-(beeping)

00:54.830 --> 00:57.000
Hiro, there's nothing
more important

00:57.000 --> 00:58.880
than what I'm about to tell you

00:58.880 --> 01:00.330
Wait. Is that a conspiracy wall

01:00.330 --> 01:01.460
Nice.

01:01.460 --> 01:02.750
Fred, what is it?

01:02.750 --> 01:04.960
Oh. Wasabi's birthday's
in three days,

01:04.960 --> 01:07.580
as you can see
on my birthday wall.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.750
Hello. I am Baymax.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.620
So, what should we get
Wasabi for his birthday?

01:45.620 --> 01:48.960
I say we get him a custom-made
Dandy Boy costume!

01:48.960 --> 01:51.330
-Dandy Boy?
-Duh. Captain Fancy's
number two?

01:51.330 --> 01:53.420
He's, like,
my second favorite sidekick.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.170
Don't worry, Mini-Max.
You'll always be
my first favorite.

01:56.170 --> 01:57.330
I was not worried.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.420
-Sure, you weren't.
-It is true.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.540
The defense of the principles
of goodness

02:01.540 --> 02:04.460
consumes my thoughts
at all times!

02:04.460 --> 02:06.790
Mm-hm, yeah.
Again, sure you weren't.

02:06.790 --> 02:10.290
Ooh, I got it!
What if we got
Wasabi a puppy?

02:10.290 --> 02:13.670
Wasabi is allergic
to all species of canine.

02:13.670 --> 02:17.500
Aw. Well, I guess
Pablo the puppy could live
with me and Go Go.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.960
-Right, Go Go?
-Oh, boy. You named it.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.380
-Pablo!
-We should just give Wasabi
cash in a paper bag.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.500
He can do what he wants
with it, no questions asked.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.080
-Hmm.
-Why aren't you
writing that down?

02:28.080 --> 02:30.670
Guys, you know how Wasabi's car
is still stuck in the Bay?

02:30.670 --> 02:33.170
What if we got it out
and fixed it up for him?

02:33.170 --> 02:34.710
-That's also
a great idea.
-I'm in.

02:34.710 --> 02:37.210
Someone should distract Wasabi
while you guys fix the car.

02:37.210 --> 02:38.210
Good call, Fred.

02:38.210 --> 02:42.040
We interrupt "Foods I Don't
Care For" for some actual news.

02:42.040 --> 02:47.460
Boss Awesome, beloved
San Fransokyo superhero,
is now larger than life,

02:47.460 --> 02:51.290
thanks to this beautiful,
brand-new mega-monument
in the Bay.

02:51.290 --> 02:53.290
The super statue
was a gift from...

02:54.290 --> 02:55.210
(whispers)
Who was it a gift from?

02:55.210 --> 02:57.290
That's my dad, Boss Awesome.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.330
They're always makin'
statues of him.

02:59.330 --> 03:01.120
Usually not this big, though.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.830
According to the Hero-pedia,

03:02.830 --> 03:06.920
Boss Awesome is considered
the greatest superhero
of all-time!

03:06.920 --> 03:08.210
Yeah. He's made the cover

03:08.210 --> 03:10.580
of Super People magazine,
like, 10 times.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.170
It would be extremely difficult
for his offspring to measure up

03:14.170 --> 03:17.210
to such a remarkable legacy!

03:17.210 --> 03:18.420
Yeah. It would.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.330
Well, find out!
I look like a super idiot
out here with half a story!

03:21.330 --> 03:23.500
Wait!
I'm his offspring!

03:23.500 --> 03:25.710
Oh, boy.
Never thought about that.

03:25.710 --> 03:29.080
So, back to "Foods I Don't
Care For, Part Two...

03:29.080 --> 03:31.330
Black Jelly Beans."

03:33.000 --> 03:35.330
If we're gonna fish
Wasabi's car out of the Bay,

03:35.330 --> 03:37.040
we're gonna need
some new underwater gear.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.290
Baymax:
Oh.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.040
Suit warmer, on.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.420
Let's dive.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.710
Baymax:
I cannot dive.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.580
Aah!

04:15.580 --> 04:16.880
Hello.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.580
I think I got it.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.880

04:32.960 --> 04:34.330

-Aah!

04:35.920 --> 04:37.000

04:37.000 --> 04:38.580
Aah!

04:38.580 --> 04:40.250
Baymax, sonic blaster!

04:40.250 --> 04:41.880
This will not hurt.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.620
(roaring)

04:49.330 --> 04:51.620
-Thanks, Baymax.
-You are welcome.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.380
You're clear, Baymax.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.710
(Fred humming)

05:12.710 --> 05:16.250
Okay, birthday boy.
Where do you feel like going
on your special day?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.920
The arcade? The zoo?
The arcade?

05:18.920 --> 05:21.620
Actually, I was thinking
of going buck wild.

05:21.620 --> 05:25.250
Let's hit my favorite store,
the Organized Gentleman!

05:26.670 --> 05:29.210
Oh. That sounds...

05:30.420 --> 05:31.460
fun.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.420
I can't wait to see
Wasabi's face.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.500
Here it is.
You are welcome.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.380
I-- I mean...
when he sees his car.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.670
Good to go.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.120
What are you doing?

05:44.120 --> 05:46.420
Is that a picture
of your conspiracy wall?

05:46.420 --> 05:48.380
Obake's playing us,
I just know it.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.380
Don't worry, Hiro.
We'll be ready.

05:50.380 --> 05:52.040
When it really matters.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.290

none of the frostings
are touching.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.750
It's perfect.

06:11.750 --> 06:15.120
Except, you got the plaid
and the argyle mixed up,
but still...

06:15.120 --> 06:17.330
Wasabi, just blow out
your candles.

06:17.330 --> 06:20.830
Birthday cakes have
a significant increase
in bacteria on the surface

by tomorrow at noon

08:28.380 --> 08:30.710
for an epic showdown!

dramatic pause...
destroy the city!

Hey, uh, I didn't mean to read
"dramatic pause,"

08:40.460 --> 08:43.920
but in fact, pause dramatically
Well, you get the gist!

08:43.920 --> 08:47.120
(laughs evilly)

08:47.120 --> 08:49.210
Gee, mister,
that old-timey guy

08:49.210 --> 08:51.670
sure is gonna mess
with your plans.

Obake:
Big Hero 6 lives

08:58.830 --> 09:01.000
I wish I could help, son. But--

09:01.000 --> 09:03.750
I know, I know.
You're halfway across the world,

09:03.750 --> 09:06.540

rain forest preserve,

He'd never make it
in time, anyway.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.170
Steamer has pulled
this same stunt
a dozen times.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.620
Threatened to destroy
the entire city

09:14.620 --> 09:15.960
unless you show up
to a showdown?

09:15.960 --> 09:18.330
-Bingo.
-How did you beat him?

09:18.330 --> 09:20.210
Yes. I am confused.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.210
According to Hero-pedia,

09:22.210 --> 09:24.210
you were repeatedly captured.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.460
While he gloated
about his plans,

09:26.460 --> 09:28.500
I'd bust out and save the day.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.790
Wait, so every time
you pretended to get captured,

09:30.790 --> 09:32.540
Steamer would just explain
his plan?

09:32.540 --> 09:33.830
Like clockwork.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.250
What are you thinking, Hiro?

09:35.250 --> 09:36.960
What if we dress Fred up
as Boss Awesome?

09:36.960 --> 09:39.000
And wait for Steamer
to reveal his plan,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.250
so we can be ready
to stop it!

09:40.250 --> 09:41.540
What happened to me be me?

09:41.540 --> 09:43.330
New plan.
You be him.

09:43.330 --> 09:45.040
What do you say, son?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.250
Classic!

09:51.040 --> 09:53.330
-(grunts)
-Classic!

09:53.330 --> 09:55.500
Mini-Max:
It is an honor to work
with the world-renowned

09:55.500 --> 09:57.330
champion of justice!

09:57.330 --> 09:59.120
Stop man-crushing on my dad,
Mini-Max.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.380
You're makin' it
Mini-Maximum awkward
for everyone.

10:01.380 --> 10:04.210
Okay, son.
The key to being
Boss Awesome is--

10:04.210 --> 10:05.250
Say classic a lot?

10:05.250 --> 10:09.540
Absolutely! Hey, but, also,
I've got signature moves!

10:09.540 --> 10:11.670
(mutters excitedly)

10:11.670 --> 10:13.210
The Coffee Table!

10:14.500 --> 10:15.620
The Dentist!

10:17.250 --> 10:18.460
The Twister!

10:19.620 --> 10:21.120
Okay, okay, my turn!

10:21.120 --> 10:23.040
The Inverted Hammer!

10:23.040 --> 10:24.120
Ouch!

10:24.120 --> 10:25.290
No, that wasn't right.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.000
The Summer Wind!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.620
(grunting)

10:28.620 --> 10:29.790
Ha-ha! The Blender!

10:29.790 --> 10:31.290
(grunts)

10:31.290 --> 10:33.210
(moans)

10:33.210 --> 10:35.250
Ninety percent there, though.

10:35.250 --> 10:40.250
(clears throat)
It is I, Baron von Steamer.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.380
Okay, son, give
the Five-Point Poke a try.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.920
Is that the one where
you do a double backflip,
land on their shoulders,

10:45.920 --> 10:47.120
poke them in five
pressure points,

10:47.120 --> 10:48.460
causing temporary
paralysis?

10:48.460 --> 10:49.960
That's the one!

10:49.960 --> 10:51.830
(breathes deeply)

10:51.830 --> 10:53.380
Here goes nothing.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.790
(grunts)

10:58.790 --> 11:01.540
(giggling)
I'm sorry, sir.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.330
But I'm extremely ticklish.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.830
I see no paralysis,
only delight.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.380
(beeping)

11:15.330 --> 11:16.380
Whatcha doing, mister?

11:16.380 --> 11:19.290
Converting H2O
into D2O.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.330
Whatcha doin' that for?

11:20.330 --> 11:23.250
Isolating the deuterium
turns water into fuel.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.380
What's deuterium,
mister?

11:24.380 --> 11:26.420
Nifty remote, mister.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.960
What does that do?

11:27.960 --> 11:30.330
Now, where was I?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.960

11:45.080 --> 11:46.250
Classic!

11:46.250 --> 11:50.380
Oh, boy, Dad. I don't know
if I can fill your shoes.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.080
Seriously,
what size are these?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
It's not how big your feet are,

11:54.080 --> 11:55.960
it's how big your heart is.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.250

11:59.250 --> 12:01.250
Thanks, Dad.

Mm! Be careful,
Freddie.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.250
Good luck.
The mustache is working.

Boss Awesome.

Classic!

12:48.500 --> 12:49.580
Nailed it.

(flatly) Oh, no!
You've captured me, you fiend.

12:56.210 --> 12:59.290
Hmm, you look... different.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.960
I-- I do?
Is it my loose boots?

13:01.960 --> 13:03.580
Because I have
an explanation for that.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.080
No, no, I...
I like the boots.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.580
The boots work.
Some-- Something else.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.210
Hmm.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.460
You've been working out!

Oh, you-- you got me!

Gettin' my swole on!

13:25.420 --> 13:26.880
Get in!

13:29.330 --> 13:32.040
-He's in.
-Now we wait.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.460
You can do this, Freddie!

13:35.420 --> 13:36.580
Huh?

13:36.580 --> 13:39.380
I'm going to make you watch
the destruction

13:39.380 --> 13:41.960
of your beloved San Fransokyo

13:41.960 --> 13:45.790
before I destroy you!
(cackling)

13:45.790 --> 13:48.290
-And...?
-And what?

13:48.290 --> 13:50.000
Aren't you gonna tell me
in great detail

13:50.000 --> 13:51.380
how you're gonna
destroy the city?

13:51.380 --> 13:53.290
No. I'm just gonna destroy it.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.790
What?

13:54.790 --> 13:57.670
You see, I realized
you always beat me

13:57.670 --> 14:01.460
because I explain my plan
right before I go through
with it.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.420
But not this time!

14:03.420 --> 14:06.210
(cackling)

14:06.210 --> 14:08.830
But wouldn't it be fun
to tell me?

14:08.830 --> 14:10.250
(sighs)

14:10.250 --> 14:13.580
It would be delicious.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.250
But must resist oversharing.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.170
Come on, Steamer, huh?

14:18.170 --> 14:21.620
No villain can resist
the urge to revel
in their own brilliance.

14:21.620 --> 14:26.330
You're right.
I can't resist a good revel!

14:26.330 --> 14:29.210
But that is why
I'm taking precautions.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.500
No!

14:30.500 --> 14:32.750
(muffled cackling)

14:34.420 --> 14:37.040
-(cackling continues)
-Now what?

14:37.040 --> 14:39.380
We have to figure out
where the attack is going
to come from.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.120
Steamer could
show up anywhere,

14:42.120 --> 14:43.330
and he has a drill car.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.330
-(feedback whines)
-Obake: You know,
for a child prodigy,

14:45.330 --> 14:47.420
-you disappoint me.
-Obake.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.000
Isn't it obvious, Hiro?
Steamer's end game?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.750
Think bigger.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.620
-(feedback whines)
-Well, that was creepy.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.670
Think bigger.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.620
Guys, that Boss Awesome statue,
it's a weapon!

15:03.880 --> 15:06.380
(steam hissing)

15:20.080 --> 15:23.420
(mumbling)

15:23.420 --> 15:26.250
Okay, I think
you're being evil,
but I can't really tell.

15:27.830 --> 15:28.880
Aah!

15:29.880 --> 15:32.790
Sorry. Completely forgot
I gagged myself.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.710
What I said was...

15:34.710 --> 15:38.420
Say goodbye to San Fransokyo!

15:40.830 --> 15:42.750
The statue! Of course!

15:42.750 --> 15:45.500
(cackling)
Yes!

15:45.500 --> 15:49.500
The Boss Awesome statue
was a secret weapon
the whole time!

15:49.500 --> 15:52.960
Ooh, oh, it feels good
to let it out!

16:00.580 --> 16:04.380
(screaming)

16:04.380 --> 16:07.290
It's sucking up the water
in the Bay, so it can--

16:07.290 --> 16:08.540
Blast the city with it!

16:08.540 --> 16:09.960
-I have an idea.
-(beeps)

16:17.330 --> 16:20.250
I hope you brought
your wrinkly laundry,

16:20.250 --> 16:23.210
because things
are about to get steamy!

16:23.210 --> 16:24.790
Uh, why would I bring
my laundry?

16:24.790 --> 16:27.120
That's a ridiculous thing
to say right now.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.330
Boss Awesome
never questions my banter.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.960
He just goes with it.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.210
Um, I mean, I did bring
my clothesline

16:35.210 --> 16:37.500
to hang you out to dry!

16:37.500 --> 16:40.830
Ha-ha! That's
the Boss Awesome I know!

16:47.380 --> 16:49.000
Baymax, overdrive mode.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.920
But overdrive mode will drain
Baymax's battery, Hiro.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.380
Baymax:
My systems cannot fully function
on a low battery.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.420
I know, Baymax,
but we need as much speed
as we can get.

16:57.420 --> 16:58.580
-Wasabi: For what?
-No time to explain.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.420
Baymax:
Entering overdrive mode.

Baymax:
Oh, no.

17:15.210 --> 17:16.330

Baymax, sonic blaster, now!

17:39.120 --> 17:41.080
Big Hero 6 for the win!

17:41.080 --> 17:42.880
Say what?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.290
I mean-- I mean--
I mean... classic!

17:45.290 --> 17:49.210
I wouldn't drop
that annoying catchphrase
so fast if I were you.

17:49.210 --> 17:52.250
You see, it also occurred to me
that you win every time

17:52.250 --> 17:54.880

17:57.420 --> 17:59.790
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

Baymax: Hello...
I'm Bah-la-la-la-la.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.420

I swim in the water...
-Baymax!

18:09.500 --> 18:10.580
Huh?

18:23.380 --> 18:25.790
-Guys?
-Don't worry, Hiro.
We're on it.

18:25.790 --> 18:27.380
-We are?

we added.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.210
Just press that button.

How's a self-car wash button
gonna help us, Go Go?

18:33.120 --> 18:35.330
That's not
a self-car wash button.

18:35.330 --> 18:39.000
What is it?
A button that transforms
my car into an underwater car?

18:41.290 --> 18:44.620
It's a button that transforms
