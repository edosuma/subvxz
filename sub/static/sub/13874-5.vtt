They told me not to tell anyone,

01:21.908 --> 01:23.143
but I'm telling you.

01:23.176 --> 01:24.476
Why, what are they doing?

01:24.509 --> 01:30.812
[beeping]

01:30.846 --> 01:32.147
It ain't working.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.147
Oh, let's see.

01:33.180 --> 01:33.980
I'm gonna break it.

01:34.013 --> 01:34.814
Oh, you're supposed

01:34.848 --> 01:35.748
to add dna.

01:35.781 --> 01:37.082
What's a dna?

01:37.115 --> 01:39.150
It stands for "do not--",

01:39.183 --> 01:40.650
uh, "in my pool.

01:40.683 --> 01:41.484
Assman."

01:41.517 --> 01:42.151
See?

01:42.184 --> 01:43.151

01:43.184 --> 01:44.885
I don't know it even knows!

01:44.918 --> 01:46.153
Carl, do me a favor and spit

01:46.186 --> 01:46.819
in that pool.

01:46.853 --> 01:47.987
Oh, you mean my pool?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.320
Oh, is this your pool?

01:49.354 --> 01:50.155
Yeah, it is.

01:50.188 --> 01:50.988
Can I go swimming?

01:51.021 --> 01:51.955
No, you may not.

01:51.988 --> 01:52.989
How about if I swim in it?

01:53.022 --> 01:53.656
No.

01:53.689 --> 01:54.523
Do you mind if we make

01:54.557 --> 01:55.390
a dog in it?

01:55.423 --> 01:56.057
Yeah, I do mind,

01:56.090 --> 01:57.324
very much, if that's cool.

01:57.358 --> 01:58.158
Yeah, he does mind.

01:58.191 --> 01:59.025
He hasn't been using it.

01:59.059 --> 02:00.292
That's not the point, it's--

02:00.325 --> 02:01.733
He's going to very soon.

02:01.766 --> 02:02.633
Just 'cause I haven't been

02:02.666 --> 02:04.334
using it doesn't mean, like,

02:04.367 --> 02:05.968
here, turn it into a dog

02:06.002 --> 02:07.035
laboratory.

02:07.068 --> 02:07.935
Come on, Carl, we'll be done

02:07.968 --> 02:08.703
with this dog in a minute.

02:08.735 --> 02:09.436
[beeps]

02:09.469 --> 02:10.103
[barks]

02:10.136 --> 02:10.937
See?

02:10.970 --> 02:11.604
Look, uh--

02:11.637 --> 02:13.105
Wait a minute, that's weird.

02:13.138 --> 02:14.438
I don't think we ever put any

02:14.471 --> 02:15.272
DNA in there.

02:15.306 --> 02:16.672
Hey, surf's up!

02:16.706 --> 02:17.340
No, Shake!

02:17.373 --> 02:18.106
What?

02:18.140 --> 02:19.441
I can't splash?

02:19.474 --> 02:25.443
[buzzing]

02:25.476 --> 02:26.277
[beeps]

02:26.311 --> 02:26.944
[barks]

02:26.977 --> 02:28.645
All right, my dog's ready.

02:28.678 --> 02:31.179
[barks]

02:31.213 --> 02:32.446
Well.

02:32.479 --> 02:33.714
Look at that.

02:33.747 --> 02:34.714
Now that's a dog.

02:34.747 --> 02:36.748
Look at him, he's so cute.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.116
Yes, he is!

02:38.149 --> 02:39.116
Yes, he is.

02:39.149 --> 02:40.050
So, whatcha gonna name him?

02:40.083 --> 02:41.450
Call him something cute

02:41.483 --> 02:42.951
like Mr. Something.

02:42.984 --> 02:44.285
Like Mr. Balls.

02:44.319 --> 02:45.952
Or how about, uh, ooh!

02:45.985 --> 02:46.953
Thunder Pussy.

02:46.986 --> 02:48.453
Shut up, I got a name,

02:48.486 --> 02:51.122
and it's Hand...

02:51.155 --> 02:52.788
Banana.

02:52.822 --> 02:54.623
Come here, Hand Banana.

02:54.656 --> 02:55.957
All those good ones and

02:55.990 --> 02:57.124
that's the one you take?

02:57.157 --> 02:58.291
Yes, we like it.

02:58.325 --> 02:59.791
Best one in the whole world,

02:59.825 --> 03:00.792
Yes, you are.

03:00.826 --> 03:01.466
Hey, I gotta admit,

03:01.499 --> 03:03.567
He is kind of cute.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.234
Tonight...

03:05.268 --> 03:09.036
You...

03:09.070 --> 03:09.836
Ha ha ha!

03:09.870 --> 03:11.237
What do you think he means?

03:11.271 --> 03:12.804
"Tonight, you."

03:12.837 --> 03:13.672
Like he's threatenin' me

03:13.705 --> 03:15.105
or something.

03:15.138 --> 03:16.273
Who the hell are you talking

03:16.306 --> 03:17.273
to, Tubs?

03:17.306 --> 03:19.040
uh, Friggin Hand Banana

03:19.074 --> 03:19.874
over there.

03:19.907 --> 03:22.175
He said, uh, "Tonight, you!"

03:22.208 --> 03:22.909
[laughs]

03:22.942 --> 03:24.076
Come on, Carl.

03:24.109 --> 03:26.243
He's a dog.

03:26.277 --> 03:27.578
See?

03:27.611 --> 03:29.078
Yeah.

03:29.112 --> 03:30.912
I'm just a dog.

03:30.945 --> 03:31.580
[barks]

03:31.613 --> 03:32.746
Look at him.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.414
Keep it up, Carl.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.415
They may just haul you off.

03:36.448 --> 03:37.248
You hear him?

03:37.282 --> 03:37.915
He's pretty funny.

03:37.948 --> 03:38.583
Ha ha!

03:38.616 --> 03:39.749
Come on, Hand Banana,

03:39.783 --> 03:40.917
let's play.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.250
Get out here, get away from

03:42.284 --> 03:43.085
the creepy man.

03:43.118 --> 03:44.251
[barking]

03:44.285 --> 03:45.919
Remember...

03:45.952 --> 03:48.920
Tonight.

03:48.953 --> 03:49.754
Come on, boy!

03:49.788 --> 03:50.421
Come on!

03:50.454 --> 03:51.088
Here, boy!

03:51.121 --> 03:51.755
Here, boy!

03:51.789 --> 03:54.090
Come on, ok--ok, here goes!

03:54.123 --> 03:58.592
Fetch, boy, fetch!

03:58.625 --> 04:00.592
All right, that was fun!

04:00.625 --> 04:02.199
Let's do it again.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.700
Oh, great.

04:03.734 --> 04:05.401
Looks like our canine friend

04:05.435 --> 04:07.235
left a little present here

04:07.268 --> 04:08.669
on my chair.

04:08.702 --> 04:10.037
Yep.

04:10.070 --> 04:11.537
Someone delivered some

04:11.570 --> 04:14.205
baked goods.

04:14.239 --> 04:15.805
How did he know I love

04:15.839 --> 04:16.540
baked goods?

04:16.572 --> 04:17.339
Look at these,

04:17.373 --> 04:18.072
they look delicious!

04:18.106 --> 04:19.107
I don't know.

04:19.141 --> 04:21.175
Maybe he's a pastry chef.

04:21.208 --> 04:22.375
Well, would you look at that.

04:22.408 --> 04:24.009
He is a pastry chef!

04:24.043 --> 04:25.109
MM, these baguettes

04:25.143 --> 04:26.244
are so fresh!

04:26.277 --> 04:27.477
I mean, these must've just come

04:27.510 --> 04:28.345
out of the oven.

04:28.378 --> 04:29.311
Mmm.

04:29.345 --> 04:30.012
Excuse me.

04:30.046 --> 04:33.747
You know, that dog has really

04:33.780 --> 04:36.181
brought this family together.

04:36.214 --> 04:39.616
He's really a good dog.

04:39.649 --> 04:40.416
What the hell?

04:40.449 --> 04:41.551
Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:41.584 --> 04:42.217
Bad boy.

04:42.251 --> 04:42.884
Bad boy.

04:42.917 --> 04:43.718
You live over there.

04:43.752 --> 04:45.552
Go--go back to the freaks.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.386
Who you callin' boy?

04:47.419 --> 04:49.054
My name's Hand Banana.

04:49.087 --> 04:50.521
What you--you talkin'

04:50.555 --> 04:51.321
to me, here?

04:51.355 --> 04:52.956
No, not anymore.

04:52.989 --> 04:54.089
We're done talking.

04:54.122 --> 04:54.823
Hang on.

04:54.857 --> 04:55.790
Let me bend over and pick this

04:55.823 --> 04:56.790
thing up--

04:56.823 --> 04:58.424
Hand Banana, no!

04:58.458 --> 04:59.925
Your new dog is

04:59.959 --> 05:01.099
one of a kind.

05:01.132 --> 05:02.000
He will roam the earth looking

05:02.033 --> 05:03.466
for a match long after you're

05:03.500 --> 05:05.634
dead, and watch out, your new

05:05.667 --> 05:07.468
dog may try to mind link with

05:07.502 --> 05:08.869
certain members of your family.

05:08.903 --> 05:10.003
Hah, good luck with that.

05:10.036 --> 05:11.970
He never mind linked with me.

05:12.004 --> 05:13.338
He's a good boy.

05:13.371 --> 05:14.071
Well, I tell you what.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.406
As long as I get these muffins,

05:15.439 --> 05:16.506
I don't give a crap what

05:16.539 --> 05:17.607
he does.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.907
He's a winner in my book.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.508
In fact, I'm gonna make a couple

05:20.541 --> 05:21.641
dogs tonight.

05:21.674 --> 05:22.842
Start a restaurant with them,

05:22.875 --> 05:24.210
call it "Dogs."

05:24.243 --> 05:25.343
I'm gonna work on that name,

05:25.376 --> 05:26.777
too, 'cause that does not seem

05:26.811 --> 05:27.944
good to me.

05:27.977 --> 05:29.112
[barking]

05:29.145 --> 05:30.779
There's the Hand Banana!

05:30.813 --> 05:31.546
Good boy.

05:31.579 --> 05:33.314
Oh, he's not a boy anymore.

05:33.347 --> 05:34.647
He's a man,

05:34.680 --> 05:36.081
'cause he just raped me!

05:36.115 --> 05:36.848
Do you think you could

05:36.881 --> 05:37.649
back that up?

05:37.682 --> 05:38.849
Listen to this guy.

05:38.882 --> 05:40.417
Back that up--I got bruises

05:40.450 --> 05:41.217
to prove it!

05:41.250 --> 05:43.351
No, no, I mean that ass.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.519
Back it up.

05:44.552 --> 05:45.185
Yeah.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.019
Do you hear what he's

05:46.052 --> 05:46.686
saying here?

05:46.720 --> 05:47.353
Sounds like someone wants

05:47.386 --> 05:48.553
to get raped again.

05:48.586 --> 05:49.854
Come on, Carl, he hasn't even

05:49.887 --> 05:50.787
been here one day.

05:50.821 --> 05:51.688
How can he possibly learn

05:51.722 --> 05:52.688
the english language?

05:52.722 --> 05:53.523
See.

05:53.556 --> 05:57.357
All I know is "Ball" and "Good."

05:57.390 --> 05:58.258
And rape.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.191
Yeah, you know it well.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.526
I bend over for the remote

06:00.559 --> 06:01.399
and boom!

06:01.432 --> 06:02.166
You're there!

06:02.199 --> 06:03.367
Watch this.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.533
[whines]

06:04.568 --> 06:05.801
I'm sorry, Carl, but I think

06:05.834 --> 06:07.302
that you need to leave.

06:07.335 --> 06:08.869
You're upsettin' Hand Banana.

06:08.902 --> 06:09.970
Yeah, well, you know,

06:10.003 --> 06:12.371
he upset me pretty bad, too.

06:12.404 --> 06:13.504
I don't know if I can sleep

06:13.537 --> 06:14.338
anymore.

06:14.372 --> 06:16.173
You ever been raped by a dog?

06:16.206 --> 06:17.006
Uh-uh.

06:17.039 --> 06:17.939
See, think that's what hell

06:17.973 --> 06:18.840
is like, you know,

06:18.874 --> 06:20.174
constantly raped by dogs.

06:20.207 --> 06:20.875
Carl--

06:20.908 --> 06:21.641
that, you know, I don't know

06:21.675 --> 06:23.342
if I believe in God, but--

06:23.376 --> 06:24.509
I think he must hate me.

06:24.542 --> 06:25.310
Carl!

06:25.343 --> 06:26.210
'cause he allowed you to

06:26.243 --> 06:26.977
create a dog that constantly

06:27.010 --> 06:27.744
rapes me!

06:27.778 --> 06:28.544
Ok, Carl, that's it.

06:28.578 --> 06:29.311
Just go home, all right?

06:29.345 --> 06:30.379
yeah, just go on home.

06:30.412 --> 06:31.212
You need to just go home

06:31.245 --> 06:32.180
and lie down for awhile.

06:32.213 --> 06:32.980
Mm.

06:33.013 --> 06:33.713
Face down.

06:33.746 --> 06:34.481
If I see that dog again,

06:34.514 --> 06:35.214
he's dead.

06:35.247 --> 06:36.248
Yeah, bye-bye.

06:36.282 --> 06:36.915
He's dead!

06:36.948 --> 06:37.648
Ok.

06:37.682 --> 06:39.083
See ya.

06:39.116 --> 06:40.984
[ringing]

06:41.017 --> 06:41.650
Hello?

06:41.684 --> 06:42.985
Hey, Carl, it's Frylock.

06:43.018 --> 06:43.918
Look, I sent Hand Banana

06:43.951 --> 06:45.152
to the pound, ok?

06:45.186 --> 06:46.586
I figured, hell, if he's raping

06:46.619 --> 06:49.688
you, then he is a bad dog.

06:49.721 --> 06:50.654
Good.

06:50.688 --> 06:51.989
He's a friggin' menace.

06:52.022 --> 06:53.489
And, uh, you know, technically

06:53.522 --> 06:55.156
he's supposed to be spayed,

06:55.190 --> 06:56.457
and he ain't that, ha ha.

06:56.491 --> 06:58.057
I know that first hand.

06:58.091 --> 06:59.692
Go ahead, ask me how I know.

06:59.725 --> 07:00.625
Try it.

07:00.658 --> 07:01.666
Ask me.

07:01.699 --> 07:02.599
Ask me how I know.

07:02.633 --> 07:03.434
Uh, Carl?

07:03.467 --> 07:08.636
H-hold on one second, ok?

07:08.669 --> 07:12.103
[slurping]

07:12.138 --> 07:13.438
Mm-mm.

07:13.471 --> 07:14.939
Ahh, ok, I'm back, look.

07:14.972 --> 07:15.939
You don't need to worry about

07:15.972 --> 07:18.106
Hand Banana anymore.

07:18.140 --> 07:21.107
So, uh, what are you wearing?

07:21.142 --> 07:21.942
What the hell are you

07:21.975 --> 07:22.942
talking about?

07:22.975 --> 07:23.609
Nothing.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.276
Ahem, nothing,

07:24.309 --> 07:24.943
just an idle question.

07:24.976 --> 07:26.277
Ok, here comes Frylock.

07:26.310 --> 07:27.110
[dial tone]

07:27.144 --> 07:29.278
[growling]

07:29.311 --> 07:30.612
Hello?

07:30.646 --> 07:32.847
Oh, man, that is a load off

07:32.880 --> 07:34.613
my mind knowing that rapist

07:34.648 --> 07:37.415
is gone.

07:37.449 --> 07:39.283
Man, it feel good out here.

07:39.316 --> 07:42.051
I might just, uh, get nude.

07:42.084 --> 07:44.785
Heh heh heh heh heh.

07:44.818 --> 07:46.553
Shine some sun--

07:46.586 --> 07:48.019
where the sun don't shine,

07:48.053 --> 07:49.087
you know what I mean?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.455
Ha ha ha ha ha!

07:51.488 --> 07:53.456
Long past the point of caring

07:53.489 --> 07:54.356
on this.

07:54.389 --> 07:56.390
You, uh, basting that

07:56.423 --> 07:57.424
turkey today?

07:57.458 --> 07:58.124
Huh?

07:58.158 --> 07:58.991
What's that?

07:59.024 --> 07:59.792
I think it's time to take

07:59.825 --> 08:00.965
a temperature.

08:00.999 --> 08:03.900
See if the meat's just right.

08:03.934 --> 08:04.567
No!

08:04.601 --> 08:05.401
No!

08:05.434 --> 08:06.067
1, 2--

08:06.101 --> 08:06.902
Yeah, baby!

08:06.935 --> 08:07.568
Pearl it!

08:07.602 --> 08:08.268
Pearl!

08:08.302 --> 08:09.403
You cut my pearl, bitch!

08:09.436 --> 08:11.037
I totally did pearl 2.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.437
Where's Hand Banana?

08:12.470 --> 08:13.438
I don't know, Carl,

08:13.471 --> 08:14.271
I'm busy right now.

08:14.305 --> 08:15.672
Just sort of set my drink right

08:15.706 --> 08:16.606
behind me, here.

08:16.639 --> 08:17.640
I got a little present for

08:17.673 --> 08:19.040
your dog next time he shows up

08:19.073 --> 08:21.008
and tries to make unwanted

08:21.041 --> 08:23.175
sexual advances towards me.

08:23.209 --> 08:24.643
He's gonna get stuck,

08:24.676 --> 08:26.511
'cause I filled every orifice of

08:26.544 --> 08:28.344
my body with wacky glue.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.312
That's a stupid thing to do,

08:29.345 --> 08:29.978
Carl.

08:30.012 --> 08:30.745
What?

08:30.778 --> 08:32.846
I said I filled every orifice of

08:32.879 --> 08:35.014
my body with wacky glue!

08:35.047 --> 08:36.515
Eh, you have something to drink?

08:36.548 --> 08:37.948
I feel like my throat's

08:37.982 --> 08:39.582
kind of dry.

08:39.616 --> 08:40.650
I put a bunch of wacky glue

08:40.683 --> 08:41.750
in there--

08:41.783 --> 08:42.751
and now it's kind of closin'

08:42.784 --> 08:43.984
up, call 9-1-1!

08:44.018 --> 08:44.985
[barks]

08:45.019 --> 08:45.819
[coughing]

08:45.852 --> 08:46.585
No!

08:46.619 --> 08:47.420
No!

08:47.453 --> 08:48.586
He's about to rape me!

08:48.620 --> 08:50.254
No, Carl, see, look.

08:50.287 --> 08:51.422
He's gonna rape me!

08:51.455 --> 08:53.589
[coughing]

08:53.623 --> 08:55.089
He's an expert on CPR.

08:55.123 --> 08:56.190
He saved your life.

08:56.224 --> 08:57.824
You all right, big guy?

08:57.857 --> 08:58.758
Yeah...

08:58.791 --> 08:59.691
I think so.

08:59.725 --> 09:00.759
Good.

09:00.792 --> 09:03.200
'Cause tonight...

09:03.233 --> 09:04.667
You.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.034
Go home and get some rest,

09:06.068 --> 09:06.701
Carl.

09:06.734 --> 09:07.535
Yeah.

09:07.569 --> 09:08.535
Don't wait up.

09:08.569 --> 09:10.270
I'll be there soon enough.

09:10.303 --> 09:11.370
Oh, I'll be waitin'.

09:11.403 --> 09:12.804
You just bring it on, big man.

09:12.837 --> 09:14.238
[buzzing]

09:14.272 --> 09:15.005
You don't know what

09:15.038 --> 09:16.106
rape is like.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.173
For years, I thought it was

09:17.206 --> 09:18.006
funny.

09:18.039 --> 09:20.440
Oh, yeah, rape's so funny.

09:20.474 --> 09:22.375
Until you've been raped.

09:22.408 --> 09:23.442
You're about to find out what

09:23.476 --> 09:25.543
that's like, Hand Banana.

09:25.577 --> 09:27.378
Eh, let's think about this.

09:27.411 --> 09:28.878
Oh, we're done thinking.

09:28.911 --> 09:30.379
'cause see, every time I think,

09:30.412 --> 09:31.212
you're there,

09:31.245 --> 09:32.380
haunting my dreams.

09:32.413 --> 09:34.281
Come on, now, I can be good.

09:34.314 --> 09:35.047
No, see, I don't think that

09:35.081 --> 09:35.714
you can.

09:35.747 --> 09:36.382
[barks]

09:36.415 --> 09:37.382
But I'll show you how

09:37.415 --> 09:38.048
to be good.

09:38.082 --> 09:39.049
Hand Banana,

09:39.083 --> 09:40.884
I want you to meet--

09:40.917 --> 09:42.584
the enforcer.

09:42.617 --> 09:43.451
I want my name to be

09:43.485 --> 09:44.218
Spaghetti.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.386
all right, Spaghetti.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.452
Whatever, I don't care,

09:46.486 --> 09:47.687
just, you know, just do what

09:47.720 --> 09:48.987
I tell you.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.088
The hell you lookin' at?

09:50.121 --> 09:50.888
I'm your father,

09:50.921 --> 09:51.554
I just made you.

09:51.588 --> 09:52.222
Ha ha!

09:52.255 --> 09:53.322
I got your father right here,

09:53.355 --> 09:54.222
ha ha ha ha!

09:54.255 --> 09:55.023
I got your Daddy!

09:55.056 --> 09:55.723
[laughing]

09:55.756 --> 09:56.591
All right, enough talking

09:56.624 --> 09:57.391
with the dogs, here.

09:57.424 --> 09:58.457
Spaghetti, I want you to show

09:58.491 --> 10:00.092
Hand Banana the night of

10:00.125 --> 10:00.932
his life.

10:00.965 --> 10:01.966
[barks]

10:01.999 --> 10:03.266
Good dog, there you go.

10:03.299 --> 10:03.967
Rape him!

10:04.000 --> 10:05.500
Rape him like he raped me!

10:05.534 --> 10:06.568
[sniffing]

10:06.601 --> 10:07.301
Do it!

10:07.335 --> 10:08.836
Do it, what are you waiting for?

10:08.869 --> 10:09.969
Eh, I'm not really that

10:10.002 --> 10:11.270
attracted to him.

10:11.303 --> 10:12.103
What the hell do you mean

10:12.137 --> 10:13.471
you're not attracted to him?

10:13.504 --> 10:14.739
Go ahead and rape him.

10:14.772 --> 10:16.105
I don't know,

10:16.139 --> 10:17.440
I'm done with that.

10:17.473 --> 10:19.006
Something about you, though,

10:19.040 --> 10:21.007
it just seem like we--we click

10:21.041 --> 10:21.675
or something.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.575
Feels comfortable,

10:22.608 --> 10:23.609
you know what I'm sayin'?

10:23.643 --> 10:24.909
Uh--yeah, well, I don't know

10:24.943 --> 10:26.977
about that, I mean, I--I did

10:27.010 --> 10:28.245
create you from some of them

10:28.278 --> 10:29.811
weird hairs, you know, that grow

10:29.845 --> 10:30.912
out of the bottom of my feet.

10:30.946 --> 10:32.579
Wow, I got those, too!

10:32.613 --> 10:33.513
You're like the only other

10:33.547 --> 10:34.813
person that I've heard of that

10:34.848 --> 10:35.981
got those.

10:36.014 --> 10:37.182
Hey, we got a lot in common,

10:37.215 --> 10:38.849
here.

10:38.882 --> 10:39.516
I'm gonna rape you.

10:39.550 --> 10:40.250
[barks]

10:40.283 --> 10:41.016
No, please!

10:41.050 --> 10:42.017
Spaghetti, no, no!

10:42.051 --> 10:43.684
Please, Spaghetti!

10:43.717 --> 10:44.352
I'm your father!

10:44.385 --> 10:45.018
Wow.

10:45.052 --> 10:45.752
Get off my ass!

10:45.785 --> 10:47.586
You don't see that every day.

10:47.619 --> 10:49.320
This software is illegal in

10:49.354 --> 10:50.921
over 80 countries.

10:50.955 --> 10:51.855
You should never try to make

10:51.888 --> 10:53.022
your own dog.

10:53.056 --> 10:53.722
I'm your father, no!

10:53.756 --> 10:54.522
Get off my ass!

10:54.556 --> 10:56.523
Ok, lock the doors.

10:56.557 --> 10:57.858
Please, spaghetti!

10:57.891 --> 10:59.024
I'm your daddy!

10:59.058 --> 11:00.192
No, no!

11:00.225 --> 11:00.865
Spaghetti, no!

11:00.899 --> 11:01.532
Come on, Shake!

11:01.565 --> 11:02.300
Nobody wants to see that.

11:02.333 --> 11:02.966
Go in your room.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.301
I don't have a room.
