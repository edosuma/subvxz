He steals them back
and chops them up for auto parts.

15:53.568 --> 15:56.106
Kind of a circular poetry there.

-Shut up!

16:06.664 --> 16:08.324
Thanks, B.A. Thanks a lot--

16:08.416 --> 16:10.076
Shut up, fool! Don't push your luck.

16:10.209 --> 16:13.495
B.A.: Come on, we got things to do.
We've got to get out of here!

about my plant than he's admitted.

chop your plant.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.274
Of course, the van, that's another story.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.440
We could safely assume that pretty quick
it's gonna end up as a charm bracelet.

Gonna break some bones, man.

16:43.201 --> 16:45.692
-Somebody got to pay.

all those other orders go into overtime.

17:03.513 --> 17:07.344
Everything is dropped
except the Victor job as of right now.

17:07.433 --> 17:10.767
Security's gonna be extra tight
and the cops will check everything.

17:10.853 --> 17:13.938
The car has to be an exact duplicate,
you understand?

17:14.022 --> 17:16.016
Look, do l do good work or not?

17:24.575 --> 17:27.694
Leave it for later.

[Stammering] Anyway, l just took them
for a spin in the chariot of their dreams.

18:08.953 --> 18:11.195
Sort of helped them
make up their mind, l think.

18:11.289 --> 18:14.455
Hey, Jack. Get this flake out of here.

18:15.626 --> 18:18.829
Wait a minute. Now, tossing out
the best salesman you ever had...

18:18.921 --> 18:20.878

18:20.965 --> 18:22.922
You must have money to burn, Mr. Friendly.

18:23.009 --> 18:24.088
ClNDY: Sam.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.795
Those folks are gonna take that sedan.

-Right.

18:36.939 --> 18:40.106
You got a day, big shot. Coat not included.

But do kill the pistons, would you?

20:29.594 --> 20:31.919
Keep your eyes peeled. l need my van.

See anything you like?

20:41.105 --> 20:43.643
Hannibal, this is disgusting.

20:43.733 --> 20:46.983
You know what that does to the
self-esteem of an artist like myself?

20:47.069 --> 20:49.774
Poor chap. Sales not going well?

20:49.864 --> 20:53.197
Not going well? l had to slow down

20:55.953 --> 20:58.195
By the way,
Roscoe was right about FriendIy.

20:58.289 --> 21:00.958
Half the cars around here

21:54.512 --> 21:57.003
Extremely valuable, you understand?

21:57.473 --> 22:01.423
As a matter of fact, perhaps we could
tuck it in your safe while we ink the pact.

22:01.519 --> 22:05.647
As you probably know,
piracy is killing business.

22:05.857 --> 22:09.688
You do hear Cashbox and Billboard
out here, don't you?
