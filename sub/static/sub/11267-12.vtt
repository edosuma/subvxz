"O Holly Night"
Closed captioned

00:01.835 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210...

00:03.211 --> 00:04.839
I think it's perfectly fine
that you're moving on

00:04.964 --> 00:06.548
'cause it's exactly
what I'm doing.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.591
Silver saw you kiss me in
Vegas and now she thinks

00:07.716 --> 00:09.217
there's something
going on between us.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.719
This has to end.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.053
I've been having a lot of
financial problems lately.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.222
Would $5,000 help?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.766
ANNIE:
Ten would be better.
My lawyer said that

00:15.891 --> 00:18.101
the only way your family
can overturn Marla's will

00:18.226 --> 00:20.270
is if there's some evidence
that I defrauded her.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.356
It appears there's
a necklace missing.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.899
When I sold you
the necklace,

00:24.023 --> 00:26.109
I didn't even realize that
it was a family heirloom.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.903
Funny, the buyer actually
told me a very similar story.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.780
Jeremy.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.949
Have you had a chance
to think about the internship?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.116
I'm so sorry, dear,

00:33.241 --> 00:34.368
I've decided to go
with someone else.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.786
Come on.

00:35.911 --> 00:36.787
I want you

00:36.912 --> 00:38.413
to intern for my company.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.665
What do you say?

00:43.377 --> 00:45.504
AUSTIN:
Hey, darling.

00:45.629 --> 00:46.630
What do you think?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.757
Am I Ivanka Trump
or secretary-frump?

00:48.883 --> 00:51.092
Well, unless you want to ride
side saddle, I'd say change.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.178
Oh, my God, I forgot we
had plans to go riding.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.596
My internship

00:54.722 --> 00:56.056
with Rachel's event
planning firm starts today.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.391
How do I look?

00:57.516 --> 00:59.059
Since when do you care what
other people think about you?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.644
Since Rachel picked
me out of a crowd,

01:00.769 --> 01:03.313
and not just for my looks,
style, and raw sexuality.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.063
She thinks I have
real talent.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.316
Oh, is that right?

01:07.609 --> 01:09.028
I think you have
real talent.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.070
Oh, okay.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.739
Come on, you have to,
it's mistletoe.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.156
Mistle-no.
If you wrinkle this blouse,

01:13.281 --> 01:14.700
my horse isn't the only thing

01:14.825 --> 01:16.618
you won't see me riding today.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.870
Knock-knock.
Holly!

01:17.995 --> 01:19.955
Hi.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.122
Why are you dressed like an
extra from Brokeback Mountain?

01:21.248 --> 01:24.501
We were supposed to go riding
today, but Naomi has to work.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.127
The clothes are ready
for the holiday charity drive.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.128
Could you put those bags

01:27.254 --> 01:28.171
in Holly's car?

01:28.296 --> 01:29.172
Yes, ma'am.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.674
You have him well trained.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.676
Oh, he just needs
a firm hand. I think

01:32.801 --> 01:33.677
it's really great
that you're doing

01:33.802 --> 01:34.845
the drive for
the shelter.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.597
Yeah, well,
I have a lot of free time.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.016
I was hoping to be working
for my mother, but she decided

01:39.140 --> 01:41.476
to hire a mystery girl
with "potential" instead.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.310
Really, what does she do?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.145
(sighs)
Uh...

01:44.271 --> 01:45.647
I saw this in
one of the bags.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.648
You're keeping it, okay?

01:46.774 --> 01:47.775
Okay. Later, Holls.

01:47.900 --> 01:48.901
Hey, Austin,

01:49.026 --> 01:52.112
one for you, one for you.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.196
Oh, what's this?

01:53.321 --> 01:54.865
It's an invite to Ojala
for my birthday.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.242
I know, me, Jesus--
it's a big month.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.243
Anyway, I was hoping

01:58.368 --> 01:59.286
you could both come.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.287
Uh, you were?

02:00.412 --> 02:01.413
Yeah, absolutely.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.915
The Greek Council's
going to be there,

02:03.040 --> 02:04.249
and you're still
head of Zeta.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.001
We're actually looking
for a new treasurer.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.669
I was thinking you would be
perfect to fill her shoes.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.045
You would do that for me?

02:09.169 --> 02:12.257
My mother always says strong
women need to stick together.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.717
Right?
Right.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.510
(Holly and Naomi chuckle)

02:15.636 --> 02:17.512
Okay.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.681
Ciao.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.809
(chuckles)

02:24.853 --> 02:27.564
Hey, Jeremy, I'll be by
tomorrow to fix your sink.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.857
Leave the key
under the mat.

02:28.983 --> 02:29.566
Thanks, Tony.
All right, buddy.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.448
Jeremy!

02:36.573 --> 02:38.117
If you don't
stop following me,

02:38.241 --> 02:39.868
I'm gonna get a
restraining order.

02:39.994 --> 02:40.786
I know that you bought
Marla's necklace

02:40.911 --> 02:43.288
so that I would look like
a criminal in court, okay?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.832
Why are you doing this to me?

02:44.957 --> 02:45.833
I'm not doing anything to you.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.126
I-I'm trying to go home.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.168
You're the one stalking me
and accusing me

02:49.294 --> 02:50.879
of conspiring against you.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.631
You know that that money
is rightfully mine.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.049
All I know is that
you're trespassing.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.634
Good-bye, Annie.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.427
(groans)

02:57.552 --> 03:00.014
KAT:
How do you know Amal?

03:00.139 --> 03:02.474
He's my uncle.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.892
How long have you been
in business together?

03:04.018 --> 03:04.810
We're family.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.312
In a way, we've always been
in business together.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.149
You know you, uh, look
cute in that shirt, right?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.609
No laughing.
Really?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.319
You need to be
prepared for anything

03:14.444 --> 03:16.030
Amal's buyer could
throw at you.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.656
That's the whole point
of these role plays.

03:17.781 --> 03:18.782
Okay, but do you think
one of his thugs

03:18.907 --> 03:19.783
is going to think
I'm cute?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.618
What if it's some hot cougar?

03:21.743 --> 03:22.619
She could come
on to you,

03:22.744 --> 03:24.705
telling you what
great eyes you have

03:24.830 --> 03:28.625
or how cute your smile is
or, well, anything, really.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.418
I-I'm just saying
you need to be prepared.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.712
Point taken.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.547
I mean, I-I do have
a pretty great smile.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.256
Don't let it go to your head.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.884
Okay,

03:37.009 --> 03:39.260
so remember, you'll be wired
just like in Vegas.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.762
As soon as you
record the proof

03:40.888 --> 03:42.848
that Amal is selling the cars
over state lines,

03:42.973 --> 03:43.849
get the hell out.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.226
It's, uh, very 007.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.603
It's also very dangerous.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.855
Okay, if anything goes wrong,

03:49.980 --> 03:50.856
I'm gonna be outside
with backup.

03:50.981 --> 03:51.690
Got it.

03:51.815 --> 03:52.900
Ready to go again?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.776
Let's do it.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.654
So where are you from exactly?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.447
SILVER: Are you seriously
asking me that?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.034
What, y-you
didn't like Lily?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.284
No, I loved her.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.286
Well, no, I mean
I-I hated her,

04:05.412 --> 04:07.497
but that is
why I loved her.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.624
I think Wharton
was a genius.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.753
All right,
who would have thought

04:12.878 --> 04:15.672
dating a lit professor
would be so much fun?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.007
I guess I'm used to talking

04:17.132 --> 04:19.927
about video games and sports
with the people I date.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.679
Well, maybe you've been
dating the wrong guys.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.889
(laughs)

04:24.014 --> 04:25.515
So what are we doing
tonight?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.809
And don't tell me you're
taking me out to dinner again

04:27.935 --> 04:30.229
because you've taken me out to
dinner every night this week.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.981
Okay, um, well,
how about a movie?

04:33.107 --> 04:34.983
I hear they're playing It's
a Wonderful Life downtown.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.695
Or I can cook at your place.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.281
Uh, Naomi's house has
a much bigger kitchen.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.491
Yeah, full
of my closest friends,

04:43.617 --> 04:46.203
who I don't want to spend
a romantic evening with,

04:46.327 --> 04:47.746
and we can't hang out
at my place

04:47.871 --> 04:49.497
until my ex moves out, so...

04:49.623 --> 04:51.374
Okay, I would love
to have you over.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.335
The thing is, the housekeeper
is on vacation.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.171
I don't think we'd
even have a clean plate

04:56.296 --> 04:57.714
in the place for
us to eat off of.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.007
If there's
something going on,

04:59.133 --> 05:00.383
like you live
with a girlfriend...

05:00.508 --> 05:01.760
My girlfriend is sitting
right here beside me,

05:01.885 --> 05:03.804
and as far as I know,
we don't live together.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.430
No.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.765
No.
(phone ringing)

05:06.890 --> 05:09.684
Oh, I have to take this.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.437
Really.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.484
DIXON: Rockefeller Center,
eat your heart out, huh?

05:17.609 --> 05:19.987
Are you using again?
'Cause I got to say,

05:20.112 --> 05:21.822
you seem a little too happy
about this tree.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.365
No, I'm sober as Santa
driving a sleigh.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.784
(chuckles)

05:25.909 --> 05:26.534
It's just, I'm
in a good mood.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.953
Besides, I wouldn't
do that to Annie

05:28.078 --> 05:28.954
after everything
she's done for me.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.747
How is she?
Uh,

05:30.872 --> 05:31.456
swimming in her inheritance,

05:31.581 --> 05:32.958
buying us two
tickets to Paris

05:33.083 --> 05:34.459
for Christmas,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.211
um, not dating
anyone.

05:36.335 --> 05:36.920
Which part are you asking about?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.797
All of it,

05:38.922 --> 05:39.881
except the being rich part
and going to Paris.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.008
Oh, yeah.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.218
(both grunt)

05:43.342 --> 05:46.221
I don't know,
man, it's just,

05:46.345 --> 05:47.472
Annie was really there
for me over Thanksgiving,

05:47.597 --> 05:50.433
and it brought
back all these--

05:50.558 --> 05:51.685
I don't know--
feelings and stuff.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.436
Feelings, huh?

05:53.561 --> 05:57.274
So, uh, feelings
of constant drama,

05:57.398 --> 05:59.151
a rejected proposal,

05:59.276 --> 06:00.277
fake Alaskan widow?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.029
(laughs)
Dude, don't do it.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.697
You guys have
way too much history.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.364
That's why they call it history,
'cause it's over, right?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.868
Or because you're doomed
to repeat it again.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.536
Anyway, look,
I'm gonna stay out of it.

06:09.661 --> 06:10.996
(phone ringing)
Here, cut some string.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.333
Hello.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.919
Um, yeah, yeah,
that sounds good.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.796
Yeah, can I
bring someone?

06:19.921 --> 06:20.463
Cool.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.840
All right, I'll
see you there.

06:21.965 --> 06:22.841
(chuckles)

06:22.966 --> 06:25.344
That was that guy who hosted
the poker game in Vegas.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.345
He's having some
party tomorrow night,

06:26.469 --> 06:26.803
wants me to come.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.347
Sweet.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.514
Me, you,
some Hollywood big shots.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.891
Let's go kill it.

06:31.016 --> 06:31.933
Uh, yeah, actually, I
was kind of thinking

06:32.059 --> 06:33.392
about bringing
someone else.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.020
That's cold, brah.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.360
Welcome
to the working world, Naomi.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.069
How's it feel?

06:42.194 --> 06:43.737
It feels amazing.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.030
I totally understand
why people get jobs.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.032
(both chuckle)

06:47.157 --> 06:49.492
I actually had a couple ideas
I wanted to run by you.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.409
Naomi, I love

06:50.535 --> 06:52.287
that you came
with ideas today--

06:52.411 --> 06:53.330
I mean, I really do--

06:53.454 --> 06:55.582
but I don't need
your ideas.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.959
What I do need is
a hot skinny latte

06:58.085 --> 06:59.336
and someone to do
office work.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.129
Now, make
a copy of these

07:01.255 --> 07:04.049
and then run to the
coffee shop across the street.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.134
Oh, and, um, you may want
to rethink the heels.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.762
You're going to be
on your feet a lot here.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.099
When you get back,
you can start filing these.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.976
(chuckles nervously)

07:15.102 --> 07:16.561
(sighs)

07:27.281 --> 07:29.241
Is something wrong?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.451
No, I'm fine, I...

07:31.576 --> 07:32.994
Actually, no,
I'm not fine.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.913
I don't know how
to work this thing.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.581
I thought you said I had talent

07:36.706 --> 07:37.332
and that I'd be planning
parties here,

07:37.457 --> 07:38.583
not pushing paper all day long.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.627
20 years ago,

07:40.752 --> 07:43.713
I started at the bottom
and I rose to the top,

07:43.838 --> 07:45.799
and I am a better
person because of it.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.677
Now, that's what I'm looking
for in my employees.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.388
In two years, I'm gonna
need a team in place

07:51.512 --> 07:52.472
to take over the L.A. reins

07:52.597 --> 07:54.266
when I open up the
New York office.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.060
Now, I thought that you
might be part of that.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.354
I don't know.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.773
Maybe you're just another
spoiled Beverly Hills girl.

An early Christmas gift?

Say it's a puppy.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.385
Ha, that-that-
that's funny.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.054
Actually, it's
a new track.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.972
(gasps) Awesome.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.268
Yeah, I was just trying to
make sure that it was perfect

before I played
it for you, so...

09:01.791 --> 09:05.837
Uh... JD's band thinks
it could be a hit.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.756
So you stole my song and played
it for other people?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.218
Um, I didn't steal your song.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.220
I thought it was great

09:13.345 --> 09:15.389
and I just put
a beat behind it.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.516
Kind of like a
collaborative thing.
That song is private.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.641
How is it
private and

09:18.766 --> 09:20.101
You played it for everyone
at Raj's benefit?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.895
Because I was
covering for you,

09:22.020 --> 09:23.397
'cause you were backstage
with a bleeding nose.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.648
Have you not been
listening to me?

09:25.773 --> 09:27.401
I don't want to do
music anymore.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.652
Okay, I'm sorry.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.820
I get it.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.947
Obviously you don't, or you
wouldn't have done it.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.742
I can't believe that you're
putting your career ahead of me.

09:35.867 --> 09:36.868
That's not true.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.036
This is exactly why

09:38.161 --> 09:40.497
I didn't want to get
into a relationship.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.333
Whether it's drugs
or ambition,

09:43.458 --> 09:44.667
there's always going
to be something

09:44.792 --> 09:46.044
more important than me.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.233
NAOMI: The copy machine
can go just there,

10:08.358 --> 10:10.985
but be careful of the floors!
What the hell
you doin', woman?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.987
Ugh! Today was an
absolute disaster.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.156
Apparently interns are supposed
to know how to do office work.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.283
Who knew?
Most people, actually.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.742
Well I'm not most people.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.494
And since I have no experience
being "the help,"

10:19.619 --> 10:21.455
I had to help myself by
recreating the office here.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.166
I have to prove to Rachel that
I can start on the bottom,

10:25.292 --> 10:26.709
else I'll be out on mine.
And speaking of--

10:26.834 --> 10:29.045
maybe we can copy that
little rump roast of yours

10:29.170 --> 10:30.671
so I don't forget what it looks
like while you're at work.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.881
Could you stop
thinking about me

10:32.006 --> 10:33.341
and my body parts for
two seconds and help me?

10:33.467 --> 10:34.717
You want me to stop
thinking about you now?

10:34.842 --> 10:35.635
A couple weeks ago,

10:35.760 --> 10:37.554
you almost set the State
of California on fire

10:37.678 --> 10:39.055
because I wasn't
thinking about you enough.

10:39.180 --> 10:43.017
I can't win with you, can I?
If you want to win with me,

10:43.143 --> 10:44.436
help me figure out how
to make this work.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.734
Come on, what...?
Dude, what the hell
are you doing here?

10:51.859 --> 10:53.653
Hold it. Hold it.
How do you kill a zombie

10:53.778 --> 10:55.738
if they're already dead?

10:55.863 --> 10:57.198
Apparently with a
foot-long machete,

10:57.324 --> 10:58.575
Be-otch!

10:58.699 --> 11:03.663
Mm! By the way,
you're out of chocolate.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.791
Out of choc...?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.960
Dude, my mom sent this stocking
from Paris!

11:09.085 --> 11:10.962
Aw, come on.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.339
Oh, so, I have news.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.174
I told some record label
buddies of mine about the song

11:14.299 --> 11:15.425
you played last week,

11:15.550 --> 11:17.927
and they want
to hear it live.

11:18.052 --> 11:18.719
Are you serious?

11:18.845 --> 11:19.554
Mm-hmm.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.098
Um, uh...

11:22.223 --> 11:25.059
I actually can't play that song.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.270
Uh, but I got this new joint
that I'm working on.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.605
Oh, yeah.
You ever go

11:28.729 --> 11:30.565
to a concert and you spend
all this money

11:30.689 --> 11:33.026
and you get all excited to hear
your favorite songs live,

11:33.151 --> 11:35.445
and then you finally get there
and the band comes on stage

11:35.570 --> 11:36.530
and ends up playing
some new crap

11:36.655 --> 11:38.072
from some new album?
It sucks, right?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.283
You end up
drinking too much

11:40.408 --> 11:42.243
and spending the whole night
running back and forth

11:42.369 --> 11:43.244
between the bathroom

11:43.370 --> 11:46.623
and... and, uh...

11:46.747 --> 11:47.832
What-what was I saying?

11:47.957 --> 11:49.042
Something about my new stuff.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.793
Oh, right.
I'm bringing my buddies

11:50.918 --> 11:51.836
by Offshore tomorrow night.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.005
Don't make them spend the night
in the bathroom

11:54.130 --> 11:56.383
because you're playing
some new crap.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.767
I thought I'd start moving
some stuff back in.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.269
Why are you
not at work?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.855
Uh, a Hanukah thing
with the family.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.358
Are you seriously lying
to me again?

12:13.483 --> 12:14.275
It's not even Hanukah yet!

12:14.401 --> 12:16.319
I forgot you're half Jewish.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.696
Oh, it's... You know, forget it.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.822
I don't need to hear
a bunch of half truths.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.408
What is it with me
and guys?!

12:21.533 --> 12:23.742
I mean, do guys just like
to lie to me?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.286
What are you talking about?

12:25.412 --> 12:26.829
Is this about the guy
you're dating?

12:26.954 --> 12:28.248
What'd he do?

12:28.373 --> 12:30.166
I should not have even come
here, okay?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.418
No, no, no, wait!

12:31.543 --> 12:32.669
Silver, whatever happened,
it's not your fault.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.836
At least, not with me.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.006
There's something happening
tonight with my uncle,

12:37.131 --> 12:38.007
and once it's over,

12:38.132 --> 12:39.551
I can tell you
everything.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.386
And I know I haven't given
you any reason to,

12:41.511 --> 12:45.014
but please, just, just trust me.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.394
I miss you, Silver.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.521
I want to be with you.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.360
What about that girl you kissed?

12:57.485 --> 12:58.695
There's nothing between us.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.870
Then when'd you start
wearing pink?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.049
Okay.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.770
(phone rings)

13:33.438 --> 13:34.188
Hey, Patrick.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.273
Hello, gorgeous.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.109
I know it's last-minute,

13:38.234 --> 13:40.194
but it turns out I have
to fly to Hawaii tomorrow,

13:40.320 --> 13:41.446
and I'd love you to come with.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.698
Actually, yeah, escaping

13:43.822 --> 13:45.992
to Hawaii sounds pretty great
right now.

13:46.117 --> 13:46.867
Great.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.411
So, listen, full disclosure:

13:48.536 --> 13:50.622
there's a girl I usually see
when I'm on the island,

13:50.747 --> 13:51.581
and I'm still gonna see her...

13:54.041 --> 13:56.085
...but I would love
to see the two of you together.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.671
I'll make it worth your time.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.506
Okay, listen, Patrick, I...

14:00.839 --> 14:04.135
Uh, let me, let me get back
to you, okay?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.470
All right.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.349
I thought you
guys broke up.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.725
We did.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.893
He found some things of mine

14:13.019 --> 14:14.187
and he's
sending them to the house.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.896
Cool.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.941
(clears throat) Um, so,
there's this party tomorrow.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.777
It should be
pretty cool.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.738
I thought maybe if you
wanted to come with me...

14:23.863 --> 14:25.406
Or... I want you
to come with me.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.408
I just think I might
be out of town.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.160
Oh, Paris?
Yeah, that's right.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.078
Dixon told me you
might be leaving soon.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.666
Yeah, that's it, Paris.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.835
Are you okay?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.211
Fine.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.255
Annie, come on. It's me.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.007
I know you. You're not fine.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.761
Listen, we have been
a lot of things,

14:46.886 --> 14:49.013
we've never not been
there for each other.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.976
(sobs softly)

14:54.101 --> 14:56.312
It should have never been
like this, Liam.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.732
I, I know that I shouldn't have,

14:58.857 --> 15:01.651
and it just all got
so complicated so fast.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.653
I don't know
what to do.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.946
(sobbing)

15:37.478 --> 15:39.814
That was... wow.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.858
Yeah, wow.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.028
I didn't really think
we were gonna...

15:46.153 --> 15:47.488
Yeah, me, neither.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.700
I know this may
sound stupid,

15:50.825 --> 15:53.327
but sometimes I feel like
if I had just said yes

15:53.453 --> 15:54.579
to your proposal,

15:54.704 --> 15:56.581
then everything would
be okay right now.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.334
Annie, I'm...

16:00.460 --> 16:01.628
I'm sorry.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.171
I'm really sorry.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.799
This was a mistake.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.675
What?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.343
Not because I don't want
to be with you-- I do.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.386
A lot.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.347
Something is going on with you.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.308
Tell me know what it is;
I can help you.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.768
I can't.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.186
Liam, you would never
look at me the same.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.230
That is not true.
I'll love you no matter what.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.857
No, I-I can't tell you.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.404
Just like me proposing to you
wasn't gonna solve my problems,

16:28.529 --> 16:31.282
you just being with me
is not gonna solve yours.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.995
You're right.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.747
You're right.
You can't fix this.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.791
I need to solve
my own problems for myself.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.306
Hey. We need to talk.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.642
And I can't take you seriously
with that thing on your head.

16:57.767 --> 17:03.481
Greg, look, I've been in
a relationship where someone

17:03.606 --> 17:04.315
couldn't tell me the truth.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.483
And I'm not gonna
do it again.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.068
I know you're hiding
something.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.569
So, what is it?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.071
Do you have
another girlfriend or...?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.992
I don't have
a girlfriend.

17:16.117 --> 17:16.828
I have a wife.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.621
What?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.330
It's a soon-to-be ex-wife.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.500
We separated about a year ago.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.836
The divorce will be final
in a few weeks.

17:24.961 --> 17:29.382
Wow. Okay, uh, not what
I was expecting.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.591
I didn't say anything

17:30.717 --> 17:32.343
because I thought
it would scare you away.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.220
Is that why I can't go
to your house?

17:34.345 --> 17:35.262
Do you still live with her?

17:35.388 --> 17:38.140
No.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.893
I live with our daughter.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.186
That's everything.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.897
No more secrets.
No more lies.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.606
That's me.

17:47.107 --> 17:47.942
That's a lot.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.528
I know.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.740
Look, you're younger
than I am,

17:53.865 --> 17:56.325
and you may not be ready
for a serious relationship.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.326
And that's fine.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.245
Really.
We can just have fun.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.165
But I can't bring fun home
to my daughter.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.834
I understand.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.671
Just so you know...

18:08.796 --> 18:10.381
I really want to bring you home.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.675
I'm ready for something
more serious, if you are.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.636
It's up to you.

18:22.060 --> 18:22.894
Good morning.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.478
Oh, do you like
the decorations?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.230
I thought this place could use
some holiday spirit.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.690
Your coffee's on the table.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.067
And I rescheduled
today's lunch for next week.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.651
They canceled.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.612
Okay. Uh, may I have
five copies of this?

18:32.737 --> 18:34.238
Absolutely. Would you like it
stapled, double-sided

18:34.363 --> 18:35.239
or three-hole punched?

18:35.364 --> 18:36.198
Surprise me.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.492
I see you're still in heels.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.453
Yes. It would take
a little bit more

18:40.578 --> 18:42.705
than a rough day
at the office

18:42.830 --> 18:44.540
to bring me
down four inches.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.757
Oh! You know, maybe you really
do know how

18:52.882 --> 18:54.842
to start at the bottom.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.721
I always say that strong women
should stick together,

18:58.846 --> 19:01.599
and with the initiative
that you've shown, I think

19:01.724 --> 19:03.559
you might be ready
to work an event

19:03.684 --> 19:05.770
I'm going to tonight.
Now, it's just a small party

19:05.895 --> 19:07.480
but one that I'd rather be
a guest at.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.732
Are you serious? What event?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.525
It's my daughter's birthday
party at Ojala.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.569
The birthday party at Ojala is
for your daughter?

19:13.694 --> 19:14.779
Mm-hmm.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.823
I mean, lucky girl.
(chuckles)

19:16.948 --> 19:18.866
Yes, she is lucky.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.535
Unfortunately, Holly is
also painfully entitled.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.037
Holly is your daughter.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.790
Yeah, that's right, you two
worked the runway show together.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.793
Yeah.
She really botched
that one, didn't she?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.878
Mm.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.673
And Naomi, really well done.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.426
You just might be what
I'm looking for after all.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.114
♪ ♪

20:02.493 --> 20:05.746
Yo, Liam!
What up, kid?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.289
Hey.
Glad you made it.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.457
Thanks for having me.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.459
This is a pretty
sweet place you got.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.252
Come outside.
Did you bring a date?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.338
I was going to, but it didn't
really work out, so...

20:14.463 --> 20:16.215
Yes. Well, this is
your lucky night.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.594
I got top-shelf everything:
food, booze, even girls.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.595
They're like Santa's
little helpers,

20:21.721 --> 20:24.598
except these girls
unwrap your package.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.100
And you can
have your pick.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.518
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.729
Not that guys like us
got to pay for girls.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.438
We gotta pay 'em
to walk away,

20:31.564 --> 20:32.148
You know what
I'm talking about?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.150
Right.
(both chuckle)

20:34.274 --> 20:35.693
Thanks.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.194
Hey, ladies,

20:36.318 --> 20:37.987
this is my boy Liam.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.780
You might know him
from his famous abs.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.490
I trust you'll
treat him well.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.533
Of course.
Bree.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.868
Liam...

20:43.993 --> 20:45.285
Oh, you two
know each other?

20:45.411 --> 20:47.038
Dude, you're a lucky guy.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.247
Bree's so much fun.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.583
I'll let you two catch up.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.377
(hushed):
What are you doing here?!

20:53.502 --> 20:54.545
What are you
doing here?

20:54.670 --> 20:57.173
Are you in trouble?
Do you need money?

20:57.297 --> 20:59.008
Because if you do, there are
better ways of getting it.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.634
No, no. Look,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.595
not all of us can make
a living putting

21:02.720 --> 21:05.056
our pretty faces on
a billboard, okay?

21:05.181 --> 21:09.602
The other 99% of us have to
figure out how to just get by.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.562
Ugh...

21:11.687 --> 21:12.730
Please don't tell anyone.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.107
This is so not a big deal.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.524
How is being a hooker
not a big deal?

21:15.649 --> 21:16.943
I am an escort.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.113
Escort, okay?
There is a difference.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.990
I don't do any of the stuff
that I don't want to do.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.533
Besides, ratting on me
could have some

21:24.658 --> 21:27.620
not-so-good consequences
for Annie.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.913
What is that supposed to mean?

21:29.038 --> 21:31.582
Please don't make me
spell it out for you.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.585
She wouldn't do that.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.878
Really?

21:36.003 --> 21:40.424
Annie met Patrick because
he hired her to be his escort.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.177
She is totally
his pretty woman.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.805
She goes to his suite at the
Wildemere, like, every day.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.641
In fact, I heard she's leaving
with him for Hawaii tonight.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.559
I gotta stop her.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.522
You're late.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.024
Uh, the party doesn't
start for another hour.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.859
It's a good thing.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.195
We have to go over
our plan of action first.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.613
It's Holly's birthday,
not Mission: Impossible.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.740
If Holly finds out
I stole her internship,

22:04.865 --> 22:06.909
I'll never become anything
on the Greek Council.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.787
And if I don't go to the party,
Rachel will fire me.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.956
Hence I'm two Naomis tonight.

22:12.081 --> 22:12.873
Well, great.
Maybe I'll get a chance

22:12.999 --> 22:14.083
to spend time with one of them.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.668
You have to stick close to Holly

22:15.793 --> 22:17.336
and keep her away from me
at all costs.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.230
NAVID:
It's a pretty big sale.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.523
Who'd you say this guy is?

22:37.648 --> 22:38.774
I didn't.
Just watch and learn.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.277
Nice try.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.407
Terrence, my
good friend.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.993
It's good
to see you.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.410
Hey, let's get this done.

22:50.536 --> 22:51.037
I got a plane to catch.

22:51.162 --> 22:52.538
How you doing?

22:52.663 --> 22:54.248
Who's the new guy?

22:54.372 --> 22:56.167
Navid, this
is Terrence.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.960
Terrence, this is
my nephew Navid.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.629
Hi. How are you?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.215
How long you been working
with Amal?

23:02.340 --> 23:03.716
Uh, we're... we're family.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.051
In a way, we've always

23:05.176 --> 23:06.302
been in business
together.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.385
And how old are you?

23:07.511 --> 23:08.595
Terrence, please.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.555
This is not an
interrogation.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.723
You can trust him.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.141
(chuckling):
Thanks.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.019
Felt like I was in
a bad mobster movie.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.937
I-I mean, not that you guys are
mobsters or anything, I mean...

23:17.063 --> 23:18.981
I mean mobsters are bad people
and do illegal things,

23:19.106 --> 23:21.234
and this isn't... (chuckles)

23:21.359 --> 23:23.861
Well, not that people
who do illegal things are bad.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.863
I'm just saying that...

23:25.988 --> 23:26.613
Why are you so nervous?

23:28.157 --> 23:29.909
I'm not nervous.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.911
Sorry, Amal.

23:32.036 --> 23:32.912
Deal's off.

23:33.037 --> 23:33.913
(exhales)

23:34.038 --> 23:35.122
Next time,

23:35.248 --> 23:36.874
come without the kid.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.752
Hey, wait a second. You don't...
you don't have to leave.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.045
Let's go.
AMAL:
Terrence...

23:41.170 --> 23:43.005
Terrence, please.
Damn it.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.965
Please, we can work
something out.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.967
NAVID:
Hey, um,
I'm really,

23:47.093 --> 23:48.094
really sorry.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.637
I don't
understand.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.307
Why were you
so nervous?
I-I don't know.

23:53.431 --> 23:54.850
Well, you have to
figure it out.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.643
(sighs)

23:56.769 --> 23:58.812
It's okay, Navid.
We'll get them next time.

24:04.442 --> 24:05.819
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.522
This really isn't my scene.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.733
Remember that time I took you
to the charity gala

24:44.858 --> 24:47.694
at that Malibu vineyard
and you ended up drunk,

24:47.820 --> 24:49.529
asleep and half naked
in a barrel of grapes?

24:49.655 --> 24:51.907
Well, it's a little fuzzy,
but, uh...

24:52.032 --> 24:53.451
hey, I'm pretty sure
you weren't laughing then.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.369
Well, people change, right?

24:55.493 --> 24:56.578
I mean, look at you.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.205
You're like a completely
different person

24:58.331 --> 24:59.332
since you met Naomi.

24:59.457 --> 25:02.376
Well, you know,
relationships change a person.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.502
Not always for
the better.

25:06.797 --> 25:10.343
Oh, well, I must say,
you have done a fine job.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.552
Although I probably
would have gone

25:12.678 --> 25:14.512
with classic roses
for the centerpieces.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.724
Yeah, I thought about roses,
but given the season,

25:17.850 --> 25:19.935
I didn't want the red to be
misconstrued as holiday-themed.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.519
You're right.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.730
Good job, Naomi.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.733
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

25:26.859 --> 25:27.401
You're supposed
to be with Holly.
Oh, she's using

25:27.525 --> 25:29.195
the little girls'
room, so...

25:29.320 --> 25:30.446
Well, you should've gone to the
little boys' room

25:30.570 --> 25:32.198
and waited outside her door.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.615
This is crooked.
I'm your boyfriend, not some
dog you can just order around.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.533
Yeah, you know what?
You're right, actually,

25:35.659 --> 25:37.911
because a dog would
actually follow directions.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.413
(chuckling):
Okay.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.165
All right.
What are you doing?

25:41.290 --> 25:42.582
What does it matter? Huh?

25:42.708 --> 25:44.293
You'd rather I'd spend
the night talking

25:44.418 --> 25:45.711
to my ex-girlfriend
than be with you.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.087
I'm the only person
at this party

25:47.213 --> 25:48.297
you're not trying to impress.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.174
Okay, and in Kentucky,
we have a little saying

25:50.299 --> 25:51.633
you use when people
try to help you.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.094
It goes a little something like,
"Thank you."

25:54.220 --> 25:55.553
Uh... oh!

26:07.733 --> 26:09.318
Who are you working for?

26:09.443 --> 26:11.820
What are you talking about?

26:11.945 --> 26:13.739
Search him.
Hey, hey, hey.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.033
It's not what you think.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.333
Take care of it.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.126
No, no, I can explain, okay?

26:26.252 --> 26:28.421
(grunting)

26:34.552 --> 26:37.054
(knocking at door)

26:40.307 --> 26:41.100
Where's Annie?

26:41.225 --> 26:42.226
Who the hell
are you?

26:42.351 --> 26:43.561
You want to pay for girls

26:43.685 --> 26:45.438
'cause you can't
get them yourself, fine,

26:45.563 --> 26:47.398
but stay the hell away
from Annie.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.606
What, are you her boyfriend?

26:51.151 --> 26:52.694
She's not who you think she is,
you know.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.113
Annie came to me.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.489
She asked me
for the money.

26:55.613 --> 26:57.866
And she kept coming
back for more.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.165
Where is she?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.584
I don't know.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.794
She told me she wasn't coming
to Hawaii with me,

27:08.919 --> 27:10.003
then she left.
Wait, she turned you down?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.755
She said it wasn't
going to solve

27:11.880 --> 27:12.548
her problems
and that we're done.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.009
This is the last time
I'm getting involved

27:16.135 --> 27:18.011
with a stupid teenager.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.055
Go to hell.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.312
There you are.
Oh!

27:26.437 --> 27:27.729
There's a problem
with the valet.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.856
Apparently, he's
crashed someone's car

27:29.982 --> 27:32.610
into an electronic Nativity
scene and beheaded Mary.

27:32.734 --> 27:33.860
Can you take
care of it?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.154
Absolutely.
Of course.
Good.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.363
HOLLY:
Wh-what are you doing?

27:37.864 --> 27:39.575
You can't talk
to her like that.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.909
(chuckling):
Uh... okay.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.661
Fine. Can you take
care of it, please?

27:43.787 --> 27:45.331
Of course.
Thank you.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.333
I don't mind helping.
It's really not a big deal.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.375
No, it is a big deal.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.042
Mom, you can't
treat her like that.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.586
She's my guest.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.421
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.589
She's my intern.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.720
You're the one
who took my internship.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.055
Oh, she didn't
take anything.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.681
She earned it.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.601
You know, sweetheart,

28:05.725 --> 28:08.395
you could learn a thing
or two from Naomi.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.315
I think she has a real future
at my company.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.278
It's good you have
a future somewhere,

28:16.403 --> 28:19.448
because at CU, you're dead.

28:22.201 --> 28:22.909

28:23.035 --> 28:25.454
Holly!

28:25.579 --> 28:26.580
Holly, I'm sorry, okay?

28:26.704 --> 28:27.247
I didn't know
she was your mother.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.624
What do you want from me?

28:28.748 --> 28:31.001
You took my house,
you took my ex-boyfriend,

28:31.126 --> 28:32.294
you took my internship,

28:32.419 --> 28:34.296
and now you've taken
my mother's affection.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.423
Get your own life
and stop stealing mine.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.884
I never meant
to take anything, okay?

28:39.009 --> 28:40.760
It... it-it just happened.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.555
Oh, like everything else
you take for granted?

28:42.680 --> 28:45.724
You lead Austin around
by the nose,

28:45.849 --> 28:47.476
you pretend to be my friend...

28:47.601 --> 28:49.687
I want to be your friend,
Holly-- I want to--

28:49.811 --> 28:52.231
but I am asking you, please,
do not have your mother fire me.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.691
I need this internship.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.985
And I really needed
to earn my mother's respect.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.279
All I wanted was for her
to believe in me

28:59.405 --> 29:01.114
the way she believes in you.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.244
You win, Naomi.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.413
You know what?
You can have

29:07.538 --> 29:09.415
my internship, and you can have
my mother-- they're all yours.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.961

his latest track for us tonight.

The only thing
I have left of her...

And I'm not going to sell it.

I get it. You don't have to.
