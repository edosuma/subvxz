WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.543
(siren wails)

00:04.588 --> 00:05.794
(Andy) Okay.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.626
Maybe this is a really bad idea.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.123
Okay. Let me——

00:10.177 --> 00:11.007
(sighs)

00:11.053 --> 00:13.795
Come on. Take my arm
and let me help you, okay?

00:13.972 --> 00:14.836
You got to let me do this.

00:14.890 --> 00:19.179
Just... come on. Admit it.
| make a sexy nurse. Hmm?

00:19.228 --> 00:21.139
I can do this. Please.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.803
Okay, then why don't
we just go back in there?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.392
— We can lie down, and...
— (sighs)

00:24.441 --> 00:28.025
I'll give you a massage. Okay?
I also make a very sexy R.M.T.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.727
I can't be in that room
anymore, all right?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.942
It's like I can't breathe in there.
The windows don't open,

00:32.991 --> 00:35.448
l'm surrounded by balloons
and flowers.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.404
— I mean...
— Oh, no.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.286
Seriously, do I look like
a tulip guy to you?

00:39.331 --> 00:40.946
(laughs) Luke?

00:40.999 --> 00:42.034
(sighs)

00:42.125 --> 00:46.334
What do you want? Anything.
What is gonna make you happy?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.586
I want to go back to work,

00:47.631 --> 00:50.589
I want to have not been shot
by my own gun,

00:50.634 --> 00:55.503
and I want to walk down the hallway
without using my fiancee as a walker.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.932
You do make
a real sexy walker, though.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.684
Uaughs)

01:02.729 --> 01:05.345
Okay. I'll tell you what.
Let's go to the cafeteria,

01:05.399 --> 01:06.764
and I'll get us a Scrabble board.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.274
— Oh, honey, you're terrible at Scrabble.
— Oh, yeah?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.856
— Yeah. Yeah.
— (laughs)

01:11.905 --> 01:14.112
Race ya.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.659
(police radio chatter)

01:20.414 --> 01:23.372
(Dov) I thought kids didn't exercise
these days!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.203
Man down! Hold still.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.413
Ah! You're hurting my head!

01:27.462 --> 01:30.795
That's so you don't bang it, accuse me
of police brutality, you little creep.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.331
Hey! Stop!

01:32.384 --> 01:35.251
All right. All right,
put the pillowcase down.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.260
Get down on the ground,
hands on your head.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.429
(grunts)

01:40.976 --> 01:42.762
Dov!

01:42.811 --> 01:43.971
Got him.

01:44.021 --> 01:44.976
(dog whimpers)

01:45.022 --> 01:46.478
Yeah, he got him.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.024
Down now.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.273
(Chris) Yeah, he's got him.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.775
This is Epstein...

01:51.820 --> 01:54.562
Yes, he does. Hmm?

01:54.615 --> 01:57.448
(blender whirring)

01:59.995 --> 02:01.826
All hail the conquering heroes.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.203
Oh. Can I not?

02:03.248 --> 02:04.533
— Hey.
— Hey, baby.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.665
Broke up a dogfighting ring
in Little Portugal.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.325
Bunch of guys stealing house pets,

02:08.378 --> 02:10.790
using them as bait,
giving them a taste of blood.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.375
You——You personally broke it up?

02:12.424 --> 02:16.758
Well... we were there.
We were near.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.091
(dog whining)

02:20.140 --> 02:21.596
No.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.178
Just——No, just——

02:23.226 --> 02:24.477
No.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.896
Chris, we can't keep that.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.439
No, yeah, look——
look, we just——

02:28.482 --> 02:30.939
We're just gonna keep him
till we find his parents, okay?

02:30.984 --> 02:33.225
We're like his, uh...
we're like his foster parents.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.654
We're already Dov's foster parents.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.311
Bite me, Casper.

02:36.365 --> 02:39.653
You know what, Chris? You decide
who you want licking your feet tonight.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.941
— How about that?
— (Dov) Ooh.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.030
It's like "Sophie's Choice"...

02:43.080 --> 02:44.195
only different.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.910
I love this little fellow already.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.335
— Hey.
- (dog yirJS)

02:49.378 --> 02:51.369
Oh, uh... (clears throat)
We'll talk later.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.797
(whispers) Yeah.
(dog whimpers)

02:52.839 --> 02:56.081
Don't worry, little buddy.
Her bark's worse than her bite.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.123
(door closes)

02:57.177 --> 02:59.463
You know, sometimes...
I don't get that guy.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.469
One of life's great mysteries.
(beep)

03:01.515 --> 03:03.551
Time for a little "Deathdomain"?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.682
Want to play till he gets back?
(video game auto racing sounds)

03:05.727 --> 03:09.345
— Are you ready to be humiliated?
— Oh, game on.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.729
(whispers) Bastard.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.854
(police radio chatter)

03:17.489 --> 03:18.945
Bye,you.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.446
Bye, Mommy.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.982
(giggles) Mwah.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.532
You gonna be working
late again tonight?

03:26.581 --> 03:28.742
I'll try and be home by dinner.
I know you got hockey.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.410
Oh, don't worry. I already told 'em
that I couldn't make it.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.999
It's fine.
Just get home when you can.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.334
I'm serious, it's cool.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.295
— Thank you.
— I can do it.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.800
Okay.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.302
Bye. Thank you.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.008
Hi.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.594
Hi. I didn't know
you've been working late.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.345
Yeah, I have, a few times.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.887
Oh. 'cause I've been
working late every night

03:51.940 --> 03:53.805
for the past two weeks,
and I don't remember seeing you.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.358
You've been working late
every night the past two weeks?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.314
Don't change the subject.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.524
(man) All right, all right.
See you tomorrow.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.939
I don't know what to do about Luke.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.449
I mean, I've tried everything——
action movies,

04:04.494 --> 04:07.827
crosswords, Sudoku.
I've even offered to play poker.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.206
What is gonna cheer him up?
Don't say porn.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.916
I would have thought the poker.
Maybe a little porn.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.997
Shut up.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.253
Guy's all hopped up on painkillers.
Give him a break.

04:17.299 --> 04:18.379
I know. I mean,

04:18.425 --> 04:20.507
I know the doctor said that he
could be down after the surgery,

04:20.552 --> 04:23.635
but I am doing everything wrong.
I'm saying all the wrong things.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.012
— Well, give him some space.
— I don't like space,

04:26.057 --> 04:28.309
because space doesn't
involve me doing something.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.137
You know, it's kind of like time.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.051
Time doesn't work for me either.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.561
Time and space——
two things that don't work for you.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.938
Pretty much.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.314
(door release buzzes)
Hey.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.315
Dale from next door is taking
the dog out this afternoon.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.192
You better watch yourself
with the dog, man.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.980
— You heard what Gail said.
— Aw, she's just being mean.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.445
You don't dump the pooch,
Shorty might dump you.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.200
So what? You hate having
Gail around anyways.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.236
You're right.
I do hate having Gail around.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.995
So what do you care
if she dumps me?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.030
— Tell him.
— Well——

04:52.793 --> 04:53.873
Because”.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.163
Gail's awesome.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.794
Little side bet last night,

04:57.839 --> 04:59.340
right before I crushed
your friend here.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.832
— It was a total fluke.
— (laughs) Yeah, right.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.841
— I had a bad game.
— What?

05:03.887 --> 05:04.717
I had a bad game.

05:04.763 --> 05:08.301
So Epstein's got to spend
the entire day admitting that...

05:09.309 --> 05:10.219
Gail's awesome.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.724
Yes. (laughs)

05:11.770 --> 05:13.556
So you two actually
had fun together?

05:13.605 --> 05:15.266
(Frank) All right. Listen up.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.649
Another garage fire last night,
north edge of 15 Division.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.945
Detective.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.569
That's four this month,
two in the last week.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.604
(Frank) So keep an eye open.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.898
If there's one thing we know
about firebugs,

05:25.951 --> 05:28.863
it's that they love
to watch their target burn.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.073
(lowered voice) Kind of like me
watching you burn last night.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.446
What a rush.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.036
— (Frank) Peck!
— Oh, yeah.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.246
— Care to share?
— No, we're good.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.378
(clicking)

05:42.634 --> 05:44.590
Detective Barber.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.092
Officer Nash.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.513
What are you doing?

05:47.639 --> 05:50.722
Well, Oliver keeps
coming up behind me,

05:50.934 --> 05:52.595
grabbing my gun out of my holster,
and saying...

05:52.644 --> 05:55.602
"What if I was a suspect?
You'd be dead by now."

05:55.647 --> 05:59.139
So I'm just trying to practice
somebody stealing my gun.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.853
Let me see your interview stance.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.738
Yeah. There's your problem.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.325
Drop your elbows.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.831
You gotta tuck 'em in.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.289
Okay.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.455
You got to feel your gun
at all times.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.544
What are you doing later?

06:25.594 --> 06:28.051
Why? You gonna text me for a hookup?

06:28.096 --> 06:30.212
— Already have.
— Really?

06:30.265 --> 06:33.632
— Mm—hmm.
— Couple of "LOLs," a few "OMGs"?

06:33.685 --> 06:36.677
— Little bit.
— Where the hell's my phone?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.686
Hey, Nash. Hot call.
And by "hot,"

06:38.732 --> 06:40.814
I mean there's a laundromat
on fire at Aldermere Mall.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.689
Arson?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.522
I don't know, do I?
Because I'm not a mentalist.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.778
Let's go.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.821
(click release)
Aw!

06:52.913 --> 06:55.825
(Noelle) Start with the other store owners.
We need statements.

06:55.957 --> 06:56.787
If this is our guy,

06:56.833 --> 06:58.494
good chance he's somewhere
around here, watching.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.750
The place is self—serve,
so it was empty at the time.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.625
That's the good news.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.004
Uh, we're gonna track down the owner
with the alarm company.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.756
In the meantime, we need names.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.668
Find out who saw what,
and report back...

07:11.139 --> 07:13.004
Burnt my pants.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.841
Yeah.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.221
Peck.

07:17.312 --> 07:21.726
Uh, I would talk to him,
but, um, you know, since l——

07:21.775 --> 07:22.605
What is the word?

07:22.692 --> 07:26.605
——humiliated Officer Epstein
in Deathdomain last night...

07:26.655 --> 07:29.488
I can respect that.
Epstein, all yours.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.023
Peck, you're awesome.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.360
(Dov) Excuse me, sir?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

07:35.413 --> 07:37.904
You can't go in there yet.
It's very unstable, so...

07:37.958 --> 07:40.745
— (Oliver) What a mess.
— (Andy) What?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.785
Kind of wish
it had burned to the ground.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.293
Why? Easier investigation?

07:44.339 --> 07:48.173
No, we just wouldn't have to spend
all day with the hose monkeys.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.999
Hmm?

07:50.053 --> 07:52.294
One guy's insecure enough——
other guys——

07:52.347 --> 07:55.555
without having to watch
last year's charity calendar

07:55.600 --> 07:57.556
work it out for the ladies.

07:57.602 --> 08:01.470
Shaw, come on. Every girl knows
it's what's inside that counts.

08:01.523 --> 08:04.356
— Man, that's feeble, McNally.
— (chuckles)

08:04.401 --> 08:07.063
Weak. For that you get
guard duty on the door.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.477
— Seriously?
— What?

08:08.530 --> 08:09.519
Okay.

08:11.574 --> 08:15.283
(inhales and exhales deeply)

08:15.328 --> 08:17.705
(breathes deeply)

08:17.747 --> 08:19.362
This is pretty cool, huh?

08:19.416 --> 08:22.499
Looks like the same guy.
Looks like we might have a shot.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.500
All right.
I don't love fire, okay?

08:24.587 --> 08:27.579
Nobody likes fire, Noelle——

08:27.632 --> 08:28.917
No. I'm serious.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.709
I spent my entire childhood
worrying about fire.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.629
Are——Are we gonna go out
this window? That window?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.047
Climb down that tree?

08:37.100 --> 08:40.763
I kept bugging my mom,
you know? I...

08:40.812 --> 08:42.928
I had at least eight exit strategies.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.561
And what'd your mom say?

08:44.607 --> 08:47.019
She gave me a plan, a little map.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.275
Plan A, plan B, plan C.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.697
That's pretty good strategy.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.856
Yeah, she was a pretty good mom.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.204
Yeah, the place was already in flames
when l smelled the smoke,

09:01.249 --> 09:03.240
so I called 911 right away.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.705
Yeah. Uh, do you know the person
who owns the building?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.039
I've seen him around.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.124
Don't know his name, though. Sorry.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.539
Wish I could help you out more.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.207
(Dov) All right, let's go.
Come on.

09:12.260 --> 09:16.173
I had a whole cycle to wait,
felt like a latte. I got back,

09:16.222 --> 09:18.804
the place was locked up.
Kept looking around,

09:18.850 --> 09:22.058
trying to figure out how to get in
and get my pants, when, "boom!"

09:22.103 --> 09:24.845
(Dov) Yeah?
Anybody else watching?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.647
That girl there.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.155
Excuse me. You mind if I ask you
a few questions about the fire?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.656
Uh, can't. I got to go. I'm sorry.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.408
It's not gonna take long.
I just need your name.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.742
Hey, I'm actually not asking you——
Hey! Hey!

09:47.420 --> 09:49.536
You are so busted.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.012
You're not allowed to interrogate me.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.639
We are not interrogating you.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.138
We're just asking
for your name and address.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.644
Yeah. Go ahead.
Keep asking me questions.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.648
Trust me, I know my rights.
My dad's an excellent lawyer.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.817
See, this is when I'm glad
I don't have kids.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.192
I only need one of you guys to stay.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.944
Finders, keepers.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.905
(chuckles)

10:21.955 --> 10:24.412
It's not that particular dog.
It's all dogs.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.869
They have perpetual puke breath,

10:26.918 --> 10:29.375
and they just love you unconditionally.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.921
We're only gonna keep him
for a couple of days.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.421
Yeah, what if you
don't find the owner?

10:33.466 --> 10:34.922
(sighs) Hello?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.258
Here.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.132
(Gail) Excuse me? Sir.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.173
Hey, do you mind putting that down
for a moment?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.635
Jeez.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.184
You scared me.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.644
Can I help you?

10:52.694 --> 10:55.026
(Gail) Yeah, we need to ask you
a few questions about the fire.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.904
— Ryan?
— Yeah, Ryan Miller.

10:57.949 --> 10:58.938
Do I know you?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.199
Chris.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.076
Chris?

11:04.122 --> 11:05.362
Chris Diaz?

11:05.456 --> 11:08.414
It's good to see you, man.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.585
How you doing? I mean, look at you.
You look like a cop.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.087
'Cause you are a cop.
(chuckles)

11:15.133 --> 11:17.374
Chris Diaz.
You know, God...

11:17.427 --> 11:18.917
He used to play cops.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.882
I never thought
you'd grow up to be one.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.546
How's your mom doing?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.056
Good, thanks.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.057
So you saw the fire?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.347
No, I got here after it was out.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.680
Yeah. You got anyone
who can verify that?

11:32.775 --> 11:33.764
Yeah, sure, my wife.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.187
You're married.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.898
Yeah.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.528
(Gail) Do you know the guy
who owns the laundromat?

11:39.574 --> 11:43.032
Uh,yeah.
His name's, um, Ron Hannah.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.281
I'll let Officer Shaw know.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.915
Okay, you don't go anywhere.
We still need to get your statement.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.330
Who's her dad?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.542
Uh, "Donald Sharpe,
of Sharpe & McCarthy Sullivan."

11:56.591 --> 11:58.832
Great, terrific, the best in town.

11:58.885 --> 11:59.874
We sure she's guilty?

11:59.928 --> 12:02.169
Well, four garage fires
and now the laundromat,

12:02.222 --> 12:03.507
all within 2 miles of her school,

12:03.556 --> 12:06.639
plus the "arson for dummies"
kit in her knapsack.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.848
— (sighs)
— (chuckles)

12:12.941 --> 12:14.397
You coming?

12:14.442 --> 12:16.148
We're not allowed to interrogate her.

12:16.194 --> 12:20.403
So you'll sit there and be my witness
as I don't interrogate her.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.697
(door closes)

12:22.784 --> 12:24.194
(Traci) Detective Barber?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.360
(Jerry) Yes, Officer Nash.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.328
I'm still kind of new here,
right out of the Academy.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.705
Well, let me tell you,

12:30.750 --> 12:33.116
we are all thrilled
with your performance so far.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.625
— Thank you.
— You're welcome.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.207
But I'm confused.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.419
When a young offender
commits a crime like,

12:39.509 --> 12:41.170
oh, I don't know, arson,

12:41.219 --> 12:44.256
is the punishment
community service or juvie?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.510
That's a good question.
It all depends, Officer Nash,

12:47.558 --> 12:50.846
on whether the young offender
is friendly, cooperative...

12:51.229 --> 12:53.345
not threatening
to get their daddy in here

12:53.398 --> 12:56.185
and make my life a living hell.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.192
(woman over intercom) Detective Barber
to reception, please.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.236
Speaking of.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.945
(door release
buzzes and beeps)

13:07.036 --> 13:07.900
(door closes)

13:07.996 --> 13:10.908
(radio chatter,
telephones ringing)

13:10.957 --> 13:12.413
(Sharpe) That's great, Kevin. Thanks.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.746
Tell you what, why don't you
put Finlay on it? Thanks.

13:16.754 --> 13:17.960
Ah. Detective.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.454
Donald Sharpe,
Esther's dad.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.165
Jerry Barber.
So we got her in Interview.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.167
Well, that's good.
Good, good.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.428
Um, must be
some massive mix—up.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.179
No, no. No. Of course not.
Waiting for you.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.140
Oh, that's good. That's great.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.145
Must be some reasonable explanation.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.318
(cell phone rings)
Ah.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.442
Oops. Gotta take this. Sec.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.442
(beep)

13:42.488 --> 13:44.570
Yeah. Oh, hey, Michael.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.027
Hey, that's great.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.159
Tell you what,
can I call you back in five?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.613
(snorts) Of course we're still on
for tonight. We're all good.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.118
(under his breath) Come on.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.999
(Sharpe chuckles)

13:57.045 --> 13:58.501
All right, how do you spell "Hannah"?

13:58.546 --> 14:01.003
Uh, couple of Hs, As, Ns,
I don't know.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.506
Okay. I'm gonna go call this in.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.007
Hey, Chris.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.294
So that——that guy
knew your mom?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.300
That's the last guy I ever thought
I'd have to deal with.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.349
I mean...
a city this big...

14:13.394 --> 14:15.635
So what?
They used to date?

14:15.688 --> 14:18.065
Yeah, for a few years.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.310
The guy took off when l was 10.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.102
— He was your stepfather?
— Are we done here?

14:23.905 --> 14:25.520
Well, we still need to get his statement.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.781
Yeah. Go for it.
I got nothin' to say to that clown.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.275
(Oliver) Absolutely.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.785
Clown... what?

14:32.830 --> 14:36.448
(man) Guys, anybody know
who that rig belongs to?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.583
(police radio chatter,
car door opens)

14:38.628 --> 14:40.994
(speaks foreign language)

14:41.047 --> 14:45.006
Ma'am? Ma'am. Ma'am! No, no, no.
You can't go in there.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.587
(Eastern European accent)
My husband——he is in there!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.425
Nobody's in there, okay?
No, the door was locked.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.586
That his car!

14:49.639 --> 14:52.255
Okay, just...
hold on a second, okay?

14:52.308 --> 14:53.593
Stay here.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.180
(Andy) Neil.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.262
Ma'am!

14:59.315 --> 15:01.397
Ma'am, you can't go in there.
It's dangerous.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.309
Ma'am! The roof is unstable!

15:05.363 --> 15:07.103
The building is about to collapse!

15:08.074 --> 15:10.440
Ma'am! The building's unsafe! Stop!

15:10.576 --> 15:13.443
| just said the building's not safe!

15:13.496 --> 15:15.703
(crashing)

15:17.500 --> 15:19.616
(gaerS)

15:23.464 --> 15:25.045
(Oliver, on radio) McNally...

15:25.174 --> 15:26.163
Copy, McNally?!

15:26.342 --> 15:28.503
(beep, squelch)

15:28.553 --> 15:29.668
Yeah, we're here,
we're here.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.803
Uh, we're okay,
but I think we're stuck in here.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.678
No, you've got to stay still,
you got to stay still——

15:36.727 --> 15:37.557
(screams)

15:37.603 --> 15:39.434
What——Whoa!

15:39.522 --> 15:40.807
Okay...

15:49.031 --> 15:52.569
(siren wails)

15:55.163 --> 15:57.905
Hey, you know what?
You guys stay right there.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.913
You're not going in there.
Anybody barges in,

16:00.001 --> 16:02.913
the roof could come down, okay?
Fire's called for a backup.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.463
What the hell
were you thinking,

16:04.505 --> 16:06.166
letting her go in there
in the first place?!

16:06.215 --> 16:07.830
Obviously, I didn't let her.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.044
So what?
She's in there with the body?

16:09.093 --> 16:11.470
Yeah, and the body's wife.
Sam, she's fine.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.889
(squelch) McNally,
how you doing in there?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.138
Yeah, we're okay, it's just——
I'm trying to keep things calm.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.550
Copy.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.810
How did this ever happen?

16:20.855 --> 16:23.346
You know what? We already
have a suspect in custody.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.355
Ron. Ron, I'm so sorry.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.857
— Mrs. Hannah, please——
— Lidia.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.394
Lidia, please. We have
to keep the evidence clean.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.938
Okay? No, no, no.
You just have to stay away from the body

16:31.991 --> 16:33.151
just for a little bit——

16:33.201 --> 16:34.691
You shouldn't even be
seeing him like this.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.280
l have to get him out of here.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.867
I know, I completely agree with you,
but right now we need to stay calm.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.872
Okay? It's very important to stay calm.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.658
(panﬂng)

16:43.711 --> 16:46.123
Okay.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.127
(beeps)

16:47.924 --> 16:49.289
What's McNally's cell number?

16:52.178 --> 16:53.759
No, I want to speak to her privately.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.591
I don't want the wife listening.
Look, it's a crime scene.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.927
If I can't be in there, I want to know
what she's seeing, at least.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.637
It's too dangerous for the fire
department in there,

17:00.686 --> 17:02.347
but you're gonna have her rooting around?
I don't think so.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.897
Well, you're not thinking clearly.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.647
We have a suspect in custody
whose father's a hotshot lawyer.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.102
If this place collapses,

17:08.152 --> 17:10.564
we need to know everything we can
before it...

17:11.113 --> 17:14.651
If you've trained her well, she's gonna be
chomping at the bit to do her job.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.858
Speed—dial 3.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.819
(beep)
Who are number 1 and number 2?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.122
(door release
buzzes and beeps)

17:24.168 --> 17:27.626
Officer... Nash.
How's my girl?

17:27.672 --> 17:28.878
Daddy——

17:29.799 --> 17:31.084
I'm sure I don't have to tell you,

17:31.133 --> 17:32.964
but anything she may have said
to you is inadmissible——

17:33.010 --> 17:35.467
I didn't say anything.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.171
Obtained without permission.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.180
(cell phone rings, beep)

17:40.226 --> 17:43.434
Kevin. Hey.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.812
That's great. Ah.
Thank you, my friend.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.769
Yeah, no, no, no, I'm——
I'm at the station already.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.185
Uh—huh. You're a good man.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.356
Her lawyer is on his way.
I'm sorry for any inconvenience.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.865
(cell phone rings, beep)

17:57.910 --> 17:59.286
(Sharpe) Maddie.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.660
No——Hey.

18:01.706 --> 18:06.450
I'll be ten minutes late.
Yeah. It's a minor delay.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.662
I did it.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.328
What? Um...

18:10.381 --> 18:12.542
She didn't mean that.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.584
Don't be stupid, honey.
Not you.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.843
Put toilet paper
in the windows and lit it.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.265
The curtains caught first,
then everything went up.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.390
I'll call you back.
(beep)

18:22.435 --> 18:24.892
This is not admissible.
This is privileged.

18:24.937 --> 18:29.351
You know what the best part is?
When the windows blow out. Boom.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.186
Esther, shut it. Now.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.941
(cell phone rings, beep)

18:32.987 --> 18:34.193
Okay.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.068
(beep)

18:36.866 --> 18:38.902
There was a body in that fire,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.408
so your daughter just confessed
to a homicide.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.123
(Andy) Now look...
just give me a second.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.080
(Jo) Can you see it?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.413
Yeah.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.422
You're looking for eschar.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.423
For what?

18:56.469 --> 19:00.053
Eschar, uh, blackened skin
around the throat, like a ring or a necklace.

19:00.097 --> 19:04.090
The skin gets constricted when it burns,
makes it impossible to breathe.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.508
Okay, I... honestly,

19:05.561 --> 19:09.099
I can't make anything out
that, uh, that distinctive.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.146
Then look around his mouth, his nose.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.398
Do you see any lines of soot?

19:12.443 --> 19:13.774
Uh...

19:14.904 --> 19:17.896
Yeah, but I really——
I can't——l can't tell.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.779
All right. Um...

19:21.035 --> 19:22.241
We'll get you out of there soon.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.026
Okay.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.412
(beep) So we can't confirm anything.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.288
We don't know whether Ron Hannah
died in the fire,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.199
or if he was already dead when it started.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.992
Sorry.
Did you want to speak to her?

19:32.046 --> 19:34.753
— Can I have my phone back?
— Oh.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.632
(beeps)

19:37.677 --> 19:39.213
(cell phone rings)

19:39.261 --> 19:40.546
(beep)

19:40.596 --> 19:42.006
Yeah.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.921
Uh, McNally, one more thing.
While you're in there,

19:43.974 --> 19:45.714
find out what the wife knows
about Esther Sharpe.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.008
Okay.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.221
(beep)

19:51.232 --> 19:54.474
Does the name Esther Sharpe
mean anything to you?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.983
No.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.191
Who is she?
Maybe she's customer.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.150
Why are you asking?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.066
No, we're just trying to figure out
who might be responsible for this.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.568
I am responsible.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.782
What?

20:07.832 --> 20:10.244
It's my fault he was here,

20:10.918 --> 20:13.625
opening earlier, staying later,

20:13.671 --> 20:16.287
all to make us more money.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.506
Every morning,

20:19.552 --> 20:22.009
| get up early to make him breakfast,

20:22.054 --> 20:24.887
but this morning,
my alarm didn't go off.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.468
He was already gone.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.476
He must have left so early.

20:30.521 --> 20:36.642
(sobbing)

20:36.694 --> 20:38.150
It's okay.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.696
(crash)

20:43.284 --> 20:44.569
(coughs)

20:44.618 --> 20:47.610
I can't breathe.
I can't be in here with him like this.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.745
— No, Lidia, Lidia, stop...
— I need to get out.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.246
No. You can't.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.247
(crack)

20:52.293 --> 20:53.749
Just hold on.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.250
(beeps, crash)

20:55.296 --> 20:57.252
Sam, are you there?

20:57.298 --> 20:59.414
— Right here.
— Listen, how much longer?

21:00.384 --> 21:01.920
They're working as fast
as they can, you know?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.922
Okay. Well, Mrs. Hannah is...
very uncomfortable.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.379
We are both uncomfortable in here.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.844
lhearyou.
Just don't move around

21:08.893 --> 21:10.474
and don't let her touch anything,
okay?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.601
Yeah, I know that, but it's really hard.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.439
Okay, uh...

21:19.069 --> 21:20.525
I'm gonna put the phone
down for a second.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.311
I'm here if you need me, okay?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.568
Lidia?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.198
— Lidia?
— Yeah.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.779
They're on their way right now, okay?
So I just——

21:27.828 --> 21:30.786
| just want you to talk to me.
Talk about your husband.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.573
I don't want to talk.
I want out——

21:33.626 --> 21:35.617
Okay.
Tell me how you met Ron.

21:36.796 --> 21:37.785
lnternet.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.918
Okay. Dating web site?

21:39.381 --> 21:43.249
It was web site, yes, where...

21:45.638 --> 21:49.381
European women meet men
from North America.

21:49.934 --> 21:50.764
Okay.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.051
And then a woman I work with——

21:53.103 --> 21:56.937
she is older and not as pretty,

21:56.982 --> 21:59.598
and yet she moved to New York.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.687
New York. So I come here.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.275
Okay, and you met Ron.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.780
I think,

22:06.826 --> 22:09.863
if I don't like him, I'll leave,

22:10.287 --> 22:12.573
but he is nice...

22:13.749 --> 22:14.829
lonely.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.457
He hadn't met the right person until me.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.542
(creaking)

22:19.713 --> 22:20.964
How much longer?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.507
You know what? Just a few more minutes.
You're doing great.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.836
You can do this, okay?
Just keep talking.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.002
You are distracting me.
You are very good police.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.920
(cries)

22:32.184 --> 22:33.173
(fire official) Yeah, he's there now.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.688
Let me know
if you need any help, all right?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.517
Everybody loves a fire guy,
hey, brother?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.057
Never have to make an arrest.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.817
All you have to do
is pour water on things.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.316
They're gonna get her out of there.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.814
Sam, these guys know
what they're doing.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.779
— I know.
— Good.

22:53.330 --> 22:57.039
And once she's out,
might be a good time to talk to her.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.119
About what?

23:01.088 --> 23:03.124
About... I don't know.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.124
Whatever.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.429
(fire official)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.798
Okay. You know what? We're gonna
hear sirens in a few seconds.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.934
Okay? So, um, how about,
uh, the business?

23:16.979 --> 23:20.096
Was the business not going well?
I mean, what happened?

23:21.108 --> 23:24.100
We could never get ahead.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.152
I told him I didn't care,

23:27.197 --> 23:32.612
but it was keeping him up
at night——the worry,

23:32.661 --> 23:35.778
that he promised me certain kind of life.

23:36.957 --> 23:40.199
I don't hear trucks.
I don't hear anything——

23:40.252 --> 23:42.163
Life——life and marriage,
you know, uh——

23:42.212 --> 23:44.168
sometimes, you know——
well, most of the time,

23:44.214 --> 23:45.499
it doesn't work out
how you promise, you know?

23:45.549 --> 23:48.712
But love... when you love each other,
that's what matters.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.130
I loved him!

23:51.180 --> 23:54.422
He never knew!
I never told him!

23:54.475 --> 23:56.511
No, no, no, no. He knew.
Lidia? He knew. You know why?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.642
Because you made him breakfast
every morning.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.097
(siren wailing in distance)

24:00.147 --> 24:03.014
You hear that? Okay. Okay.
Okay, just breathe.

24:03.067 --> 24:07.060
We're gonna be fine. Hold onto me,
and just breathe. That's it.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.602
Okay.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.572
(siren stops)

24:13.827 --> 24:15.954
(fire official)
Let's make it work, guys. Yeah.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.372
In there.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.075
I've got her on the phone right now.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.496
What the hell you doing?

24:25.172 --> 24:26.082
Sam!

24:27.091 --> 24:30.049
Follow me, walk where I walk,
and keep your head up.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.253
We're gonna use the saw.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.388
Tell 'em to stay back,
get under something solid.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.889
Andy? Andy, you there?

24:38.394 --> 24:41.352
— Sam, yeah, yeah, I'm here.
— They're gonna cut through, all right?

24:41.397 --> 24:43.479
You guys got to find
some solid cover, stay back.

24:43.691 --> 24:44.806
(saw blade buzzing)

24:44.858 --> 24:47.144
— We got to go under the desk.
— I can't.

24:47.194 --> 24:50.061
I know. Look, we can't.
We ha——We can't go anywhere else.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.399
Okay? This is the only place
that's stable in here.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.700
We've got to go under there.
Okay? You can do it.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.546
Oh, God.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.843
(gasping)

26:14.406 --> 26:15.521
Hey.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.780
Come on.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.565
Yeah.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.368
(female witness) I got here around 9:45.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.032
Um, I didn't even know there was a fire
until I saw the trucks.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.325
— (Gail) Chris?
— Okay.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.244
Andy and the wife are okay.
They got them both out.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.504
We should probably call Luke
about Andy.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.834
You know, I think
he'd probably want to know.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.091
Yeah, she'll call him
when she's done with Jo.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.469
Chris, we really should go back
and finish taking Ryan's statement.

26:39.515 --> 26:43.383
What part of "I've got nothin' to say
to that clown," didn't you understand?

26:43.477 --> 26:45.263
The "clown" part.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.553
Look, I don't want to talk to him.
All right?

26:50.109 --> 26:53.146
My mom gave everything to that guy.

26:53.195 --> 26:57.029
Okay? She was a——
She was a complete basket case,

26:57.074 --> 26:59.030
and he made her that way.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.567
And when he finally left...

27:03.664 --> 27:05.950
she lost it.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.039
I mean, it was...

27:10.003 --> 27:12.585
lt was——lt was bad.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.170
Look, he——he didn't
have time for us then,

27:17.261 --> 27:19.172
so I don't have time
for him now.

27:19.221 --> 27:23.009
Okay, okay. You stay here.
I'll get a statement.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.638
So Ron Hannah's broke.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.679
He feels really guilty.
He's in terrible debt.

27:29.731 --> 27:33.315
So you think he set the fire
for the insurance money?

27:33.360 --> 27:35.692
(chuckles)
You're a romantic, huh?

27:35.737 --> 27:37.989
I just think he probably read the papers,
you know,

27:38.031 --> 27:40.898
sees that there's a bunch of fires in the area
and decides he'll copycat.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.316
Okay. So he sets the fire. Fine.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.405
How's he get stuck in his office?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.199
Uh, I don't know.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.113
I mean, maybe it went up faster
than he thought it would.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.579
McNally's got pretty good instincts.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.242
Is that right?

27:52.296 --> 27:54.503
While you were in there,
the girl confessed——

27:54.548 --> 27:56.630
all four garages and this one
this morning.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.586
Oh. O—Okay. Well...

28:01.638 --> 28:03.424
I'll just go get cleaned up, then.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.344
Well, she was in there with the wife.
You were not.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.763
Yeah, okay.
I'll check out her hunch.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.520
I'm sorry.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.611
I didn't talk much to Hannah,

28:20.657 --> 28:23.774
but he seemed friendly
with the rental car guy.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.534
He spent most of his day
in the parking lot,

28:26.580 --> 28:27.820
drinking coffee with him.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.623
Okay. So I'm gonna need you
to sign this statement,

28:31.668 --> 28:32.783
once we have it typed.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.632
Chris Diaz——
l'm his girlfriend, and...

28:41.345 --> 28:43.757
you should know
that he turned out amazing.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.591
That's good.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.767
I'm glad.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.843
Kid had it pretty rough.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.228
Yeah, I'm sure you leaving
didn't help things.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.026
She was always on that kid.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.358
She had all these crazy rules.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.406
He tried to make himself dinner once,

29:06.161 --> 29:07.241
and he stood on a chair

29:07.287 --> 29:09.369
to get some spaghetti
out of the cupboard,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.363
and he spilled the whole box.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.834
Tina made him stand on that chair
for three hours.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.500
A little kid,

29:18.548 --> 29:21.335
white as a sheet,
and his knees were buckling...

29:26.390 --> 29:29.723
The day I called Child Services
was the day she kicked me out.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.615
Your dad always that busy?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.868
God. Makes me feel like
the best mother in the world.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.493
My kid still gets mad at me, though.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.950
When I work late nights,
hides my keys,

29:57.004 --> 29:58.665
pretends he's got a sore throat.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.498
It works about half the time.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.755
But it's a fine line.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.383
Gotta be careful how much
you want to sacrifice

30:09.433 --> 30:11.765
just to get a bit of attention.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.771
Did somebody, uh,
actually die in that fire?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.603
Mm—hmm.
Man named Ron Hannah.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.689
He was the owner.
He was married.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.694
I didn't do it.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.240
So why were you there?

30:32.873 --> 30:34.238
My school's two blocks away.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.122
I saw the fire,
and I got off the bus.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.541
And what about all that stuff
in your backpack?

30:39.713 --> 30:43.456
l was gonna torch the utility shed
after fifth period.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.343
You get anything
off that welding guy?

30:48.388 --> 30:52.051
Um, yeah. I did.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.684
Okay, what's going on?
Are you so awesome

30:55.729 --> 30:57.970
that you convinced Chris
to get rid of that puppy?

30:58.607 --> 31:01.690
You know, there's a really big difference
between us and Chris.

31:01.735 --> 31:06.980
Not sure I like being lumped
into the Gail camp, but proceed.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.032
He's used to looking after things, and...

31:10.077 --> 31:11.783
we're used to being looked after.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.820
If he wants the dog,
he can keep it.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.869
Okay, what just happened?

31:21.922 --> 31:24.664
Okay. So the kid
didn't light the fire.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.547
I'm sure Detective Rosati
will follow up on what you said.

31:26.593 --> 31:27.958
Yeah, what if she doesn't, huh?

31:28.011 --> 31:30.468
Besides, they're always telling us to do
more proactive policing anyway.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.050
Yeah, but...

31:33.016 --> 31:33.846
(clank)

31:33.892 --> 31:35.257
There.
(opens door)

31:36.144 --> 31:37.395
— Cover me.
— Yeah.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.190
Not that I'm a party to this clear
violation of the rules, but, uh...

31:43.235 --> 31:44.315
how can we help?

31:44.361 --> 31:45.476
You talk to Ryan?

31:45.529 --> 31:46.735
Yeah.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.522
— What'd he say?
— Nothing much.

31:49.616 --> 31:53.780
Ouch. Okay.
Move over. Cover me.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.115
Okay, what is going on here?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.621
l'm smelling for gas.
If Ron Hannah started the fire,

31:58.667 --> 31:59.873
maybe he brought a can of it to work.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.533
Yeah, unless he didn't start it.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.871
Well, then who?

32:02.963 --> 32:05.705
Bet that rental car company's got gas.

32:13.890 --> 32:14.970
What's his name?

32:15.016 --> 32:16.301
Nappo. Joey Nappo.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.684
Mr. Nappo.
Andy McNally, 15 Division.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.638
(sighs) I already talked
to the police.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.018
Yeah.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.899
You said you didn't know the guy
who owned the laundromat.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.443
(Gail) Yeah, but according
to the other tenants,

32:28.488 --> 32:30.444
you guys were
afternoon coffee buddies.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.572
Not anymore.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.992
(voice breaking)
Is that Ron?

32:39.040 --> 32:42.248
| just spoke to his wife, Lidia.
You know her?

32:42.294 --> 32:45.752
That's all he ever talked about.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.629
She's the reason he asked me——

32:48.842 --> 32:50.082
How much he offer you?

32:51.052 --> 32:53.259
$10,000.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.256
He wasn't supposed to be in there.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.850
He was gonna go home.

33:01.855 --> 33:02.844
He was gonna lock up

33:02.898 --> 33:07.232
and tape a note on the door
saying, "back in five"...

33:11.990 --> 33:16.484
This whole thing was to help him
start a new life.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.921
How's it going with
little Miss Firestarter?

33:29.966 --> 33:33.299
Her dad took her home.
She's got an order to appear in the morning,

33:33.345 --> 33:35.256
so I guess we'll see what happens.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.921
Probably nothing,
with a father like that.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.681
Where is my phone?

33:42.270 --> 33:43.350
You're not working late tonight?

33:43.396 --> 33:47.514
(sighs) No way. What I need is
a hot bath, not more overtime.

33:47.567 --> 33:51.025
Yeah, two weeks straight of OT.
Must be a little burnt out.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.905
$10,000.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.363
That's how much one round
of in vitro costs.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.366
l'm killing myself
just trying to get pregnant.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.996
So you should take a little time off.

34:07.045 --> 34:07.955
I can't.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.710
I mean, one, I can't afford it,

34:09.756 --> 34:13.044
and two, when a woman
takes time off in this job,

34:13.093 --> 34:14.299
everybody starts talking.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.050
She's either having
a nervous breakdown,

34:16.096 --> 34:17.836
or she's having a baby.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.470
I don't know which is worse.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.597
You should talk to Frank.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.053
(scoffs) I don't think so.

34:23.103 --> 34:25.185
I'm serious. He's discreet.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.186
He'll run a smoke screen for you,

34:27.232 --> 34:31.020
you know, tell everyone you're studying
for the sergeants' exam or something.

34:31.111 --> 34:32.976
Wow, you're good at this.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.482
Don't change the subject.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.612
Congrats on the confession.

34:42.247 --> 34:43.862
(Jerry) I can't believe it.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.248
l pour my heart out to you
in eloquent text messages,

34:47.294 --> 34:48.409
and you lose your phone?

34:48.461 --> 34:52.329
I didn't lose it.
I can't find it.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.748
Traci, l'm miserable.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.632
We talked about this.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.919
I know, I know. I get it.

35:00.015 --> 35:03.553
You're tough, beautiful,
sexy, and ambitious,

35:03.602 --> 35:05.058
and you're throwing away
your happiness

35:05.145 --> 35:06.976
'cause you think it's gonna
make you better at work.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.057
Here's the thing.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.056
I'm telling you firsthand,
from personal experience——

35:11.109 --> 35:12.315
Jerry.

35:17.824 --> 35:18.939
You.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.111
You're Jerry?

35:21.161 --> 35:22.571
What are you doing here?

35:26.875 --> 35:28.160
"Tuesday still lingers," huh?

35:29.836 --> 35:31.337
— Dex——
— All right...

35:31.379 --> 35:32.915
— Just take this.
— ...here's the thing.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.336
Oh. Wow. No, no...

35:37.385 --> 35:38.465
(officer) What happened?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.342
It's good. It's good.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.719
— (Traci) What, uh...
— (Dex) Aah...

35:42.349 --> 35:43.259
Dex...

35:44.225 --> 35:45.601
Are you okay?

35:45.644 --> 35:46.884
(laughs to himself)

35:48.897 --> 35:50.182
Show's over.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.307
You got a minute?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.566
Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.317
Uh, the——the minute's not now.

35:56.363 --> 35:59.651
The minute is really later,
tomorrow, next week, even.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.945
Can we book an appointment
or something?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.782
Is this about a fire?

36:06.831 --> 36:09.322
No. No, it——it's more personal,
kind of,

36:09.376 --> 36:11.537
but not in a "big deal"
kind of way, just...

36:13.713 --> 36:15.419
Okay, how about Friday?

36:15.465 --> 36:17.501
That new ltalian place on King?

36:17.550 --> 36:20.041
Say, 7:00...ish.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.756
W——That's not wh——

36:21.805 --> 36:23.921
Uh, uh, sure.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.838
Sure, that——that'd be nice.

36:25.892 --> 36:28.304
Okay, so |'||——|'|| see you then.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.184
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.138
Yeah.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.404
(knock on door)

36:41.491 --> 36:42.571
Hey.

36:42.617 --> 36:46.360
ldent found a plastic pill bottle
melted in Ron Hannah's pocket.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.654
Still waiting on the results from toxicology.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.868
Okay.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.829
Well, the guy was probably unconscious
by the time Joey Nappo set the fire.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.665
— Suicide.
— Yeah, looks like, uh,

36:56.715 --> 36:58.797
he wanted his wife to have
the life insurance money, too.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.170
So what, you love something,
you set it free?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.176
(chuckles) Not me.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.713
Me, I like to keep
the things I love close.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.802
Hold 'em in a death grip,
never let 'em go.

37:17.944 --> 37:21.186
Who does that?
What kind of person actually...

37:21.906 --> 37:23.066
What?

37:23.116 --> 37:25.232
Okay, so——so Ron Hannah
starts talking details

37:25.285 --> 37:26.525
about torching the place, right?

37:26.578 --> 37:29.194
And——And Joey just says,
"Sure. Yeah, no problem, buddy.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.329
Give me 10K,
and I'll light the fuse for you."

37:31.374 --> 37:35.413
Well, it's illegal, but he didn't know
Ron was gonna kill himself.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.168
Yeah, but if the guy's your friend,

37:37.213 --> 37:39.329
you'd think that he'd give him
some time to think it over.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.213
I mean, you don't have
to light the frickin' match.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.503
Time and space, McNally.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.885
You said it yourself.
None of us are experts.

37:45.930 --> 37:50.173
Except you. Time and space,
and you're a bona fide savant.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.434
I'm there when it matters.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.140
(locker door closes)

38:05.617 --> 38:06.572
Sam.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.025
What? You need a ride?

38:10.705 --> 38:15.039
No. No, I don't. Thank you.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.368
Okey—doke.

38:22.175 --> 38:25.417
Thai, sushi, or Chinese?

38:25.470 --> 38:26.630
Whatever. You pick.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.299
Chris is gonna want pizza again.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.305
Have you ever met Chris's mother?

38:31.351 --> 38:33.592
No. Why?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.728
I'm thinking she might have
been a little out there.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.225
And maybe that's why...
Chris is with me,

38:42.278 --> 38:44.314
because I'm nuts
just like his mother.

38:44.364 --> 38:49.199
No, Gail. You're not nuts.
You're——

38:49.244 --> 38:50.108
Don't.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.286
No. I mean it.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.448
You're awesome.

38:58.753 --> 38:59.663
Really.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.498
Dov...

39:01.548 --> 39:03.038
(door opens and closes)

39:03.967 --> 39:05.047
Hey.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.300
(Oceanship's "Anywhere at All" playing)

39:07.345 --> 39:08.960
(sighs)

39:09.681 --> 39:10.966
What are you guys talking about?

39:12.058 --> 39:12.922
The dog.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.807
We should keep it.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.640
Ah. Yeah, we, uh,
found the owner today.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.055
4—year—old kid in Riverdale.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.193
J‘ Honestly J‘

39:28.074 --> 39:30.281
J‘ But where is that to be J‘

39:30.326 --> 39:31.361
You okay?

39:32.203 --> 39:33.318
(Gail whispers) I'm sorry.

39:33.413 --> 39:36.325
J‘ Where do | go to find J‘

39:37.542 --> 39:40.033
J‘ Some peace of mind? J‘

39:40.086 --> 39:41.872
(pop)
(both laughing)

39:41.921 --> 39:43.036
(pep,pop)

39:45.633 --> 39:47.339
(Jo) Remember when,
uh, that guy bit me,

39:47.385 --> 39:48.921
and they made me see a shrink?

39:48.970 --> 39:52.133
(chuckles, groans)

39:52.181 --> 39:54.593
Come on. It's time you stopped
feeling sorry for yourself.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.509
You know what I love about you
is your sympathetic nature.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.052
You didn't die.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.515
Florence Nightingale over here.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.520
Uaughs)

40:01.566 --> 40:03.852
Yeah, get——get rid of those,
too, please.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.484
I'm working on it as fast as I can.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.485
Oh, seriously, though, this is great.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.944
I feel like I can breathe
in here again.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.488
(Jo laughing)
