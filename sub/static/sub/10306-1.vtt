01:29.555 --> 01:32.290
Ow!

01:32.959 --> 01:35.227
Are you okay, Allie?
I heard a thump.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.764
What are you doing
on the floor?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.565
I guess I fell
out of bed.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.503
Oh. I remember you used to do that
all the time when you were four.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.472
I bet when I was four, I wasn't
dreaming about medieval combat.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.573
I was.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.142
What a surprise.

01:50.176 --> 01:53.178
Well, as long as you're up,
you can unpack.

01:53.479 --> 01:54.579
Sure.

02:21.607 --> 02:23.041
What's the point?

02:48.434 --> 02:49.634
All unpacked, sweetie?

02:49.669 --> 02:50.869
Getting there.
Good.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.805
I see King Arthur
and his Merry Men

02:53.840 --> 02:55.574
have once again
taken over the house.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.076
It was Robin Hood who had
the Merry Men, sweetie.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.112
Arthur had the Knights
of the Round Table.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.780
You know that.
Yes, I do.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.683
How could I not know that, when
it's all you guys talk about?

03:04.717 --> 03:06.585
We're professors of
medieval literature, Allie.

03:06.619 --> 03:07.853
It's our job.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.188
I know, but you guys talk
about King Arthur so much,

03:10.223 --> 03:12.224
I'm starting to
dream about him.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.227
And not like most girls who dream
about knights in shining armor.

03:15.261 --> 03:18.096
Mine have dirt
all over them and BO

03:18.131 --> 03:19.898
and are missing
half their teeth.

03:19.932 --> 03:21.066
You're actually
quite accurate.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.567
During Arthurian times,
dental hygiene

03:22.602 --> 03:23.568
wasn't considered
to be...

03:23.603 --> 03:25.070
Dad! Seriously!

03:25.638 --> 03:27.205
Sorry. Sorry.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.308
Eww.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.144
Here you go.
Thanks.

03:32.178 --> 03:33.678
I don't know why you
guys bother to unpack.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.715
We're just going to move
in six months, right?

03:36.749 --> 03:37.916
Which would be great.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.351
I mean, like
you always say,

03:39.385 --> 03:41.286
who wants to live in one
place their whole life?

03:43.723 --> 03:44.890
What?

03:45.691 --> 03:48.460
Well, it's not going to be
six months this time.

03:49.328 --> 03:51.363
What, one month? Two?

03:51.397 --> 03:54.766
Maybe I should legally
change my name to "New Girl. "

03:54.801 --> 03:56.468
It's three years, Allie.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.804
What?

03:58.838 --> 04:00.772
We're going to be here
for three years.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.508
This place is... special.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.610
We were just offered
contracts at the university.

04:05.645 --> 04:06.711
So, we're staying?

04:07.413 --> 04:10.248
Yes. Now, we know that
three years is a long time...

04:10.283 --> 04:13.018
Wait. I'm going to be at
Avalon High until I graduate

04:13.786 --> 04:14.986
Yes.

04:15.021 --> 04:18.055
And I can try out
for the track team?

04:18.089 --> 04:20.125
And finish a season?
And make actual friends?

04:20.493 --> 04:21.660
Yes.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.030
Yes! Yes! Yes!

04:25.898 --> 04:26.832
My coffee,
my coffee...

04:26.866 --> 04:28.333
Oh, sorry.
Whoo-hoo!

04:28.768 --> 04:29.935
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.269
Where are you going?

04:43.816 --> 04:45.450
Morning.
Morning.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.381
After you.

05:17.550 --> 05:18.583
Thanks.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.325
All done?

05:53.686 --> 05:54.753
I'll just...

05:55.755 --> 05:56.821
Bye.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.334
Weird.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.590
Are you nervous?

06:33.459 --> 06:35.393
Mom, it's, like, my
billionth first day of school.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.862
I know.
So, you're nervous.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.130
Of course I'm nervous!

06:39.165 --> 06:40.732
You'll be fine.
You always are.

06:42.768 --> 06:43.902
I'll pick you up
at 3:00.

06:43.936 --> 06:44.936
Oh.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.905
Actually, make it 5:00.

06:46.939 --> 06:48.106
I'm going out for
track, remember?

06:48.941 --> 06:50.642
Bye, Mom.
Bye, honey.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.359
Marco, why can't you
just steal my lunch money

07:07.393 --> 07:08.360
like every other bully?

07:08.394 --> 07:10.428
I need my locker!
What's wrong with yours?

07:10.463 --> 07:11.963
Well, Miles,
since you asked,

07:11.998 --> 07:13.832
mine's too far
from class.

07:13.866 --> 07:14.899
You don't even
go to class!

07:14.934 --> 07:16.067
Give me the combination.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.335
1-2-3-4-5.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.570
Give it to me,
Preschool,

07:18.604 --> 07:19.704
or I'll put
in the locker.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.606
Wow, nerd in a locker. How original.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.675
We're now living inside
an '80s teen movie.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.377
That's enough, Marco!

07:27.446 --> 07:28.613
Hooray!

07:28.647 --> 07:30.782
If it isn't Will Wagner here
to save the day! My hero.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.852
What are you gonna do, Will, hit me?

07:33.886 --> 07:35.620
You're not worth
the detention.

07:35.654 --> 07:37.655
Just get outta here,
before I change my mind.

07:39.592 --> 07:40.625
Okay.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.567
Whatever.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.472
He can't protect you
24 hours a day.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.875
Oh, wow, you know that
there are 24 hours in a day?

07:56.909 --> 07:58.109
You must be evolving.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.115
Thanks, Will.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.785
I was about to, as they
say, "throw down" with him,

08:06.819 --> 08:08.686
but I thought you might
want to deal with him

08:08.721 --> 08:10.021
yourself,
since he's your brother.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.423
Step-brother.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.762
Hey!

08:23.836 --> 08:25.270
Hey.
Water Fountain Girl!

08:25.938 --> 08:26.905
I guess that's me. Hi.

08:27.606 --> 08:29.741
Hey! I didn't know you
went to Avalon High.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.576
Yeah. I didn't know
you went here either.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.878
Although, technically, I don't
know anyone who goes here.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.080
I'm new.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.948
I mean, my name's not "New," it's Allie.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.284
I'm Will.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.855
There. Now you officially
know one person.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.691
Yep, I'm practically Homecoming Queen.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.227
So, are you on
the track team?

08:49.762 --> 08:51.463
Because of the
running in the park.

08:51.497 --> 08:54.532
Or maybe you just like
running. I love running.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.968
Wow. Did I just say
"running" like four times?

08:57.002 --> 08:59.571
Football, actually.
I'm kind of the quarterback.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.139
Of course you are.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.075
I mean, because you seem
so quarterback-esque.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.844
Hey, sweetie.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.746
Come on, I want to make sure
we sit together in History.

09:08.781 --> 09:09.981
Hi.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.150
Jen, this is Allie.
She's new.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.651
Allie, this is
my girlfriend Jen.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.019
Hi! Nice to meet you!

09:15.054 --> 09:16.521
Yeah, you, too.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.289
There you go. Your friends
have already doubled.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.260
Wait, lipstick.
Will, Jen.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.928
Where were you guys
this morning?

09:23.963 --> 09:25.096
Didn't you get my text?

09:25.131 --> 09:27.432
Five burgers
for five bucks!

09:27.466 --> 09:30.335
Allie, this human garbage
disposal is my best buddy Lance.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.036
Lance, Allie.

09:32.771 --> 09:33.972
Hi.
Hey.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.974
Did you meet Jen?

09:36.008 --> 09:37.041
Jen's the coolest
chick in school.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.710
Yeah.
That she is.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.011
Aw, thanks, guys.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.482
So, what's your
first class?

09:45.718 --> 09:47.085
European History
with Mr. Moore.

09:47.586 --> 09:48.920
Oh, we've got that,
too! Come with us!

10:00.132 --> 10:01.432
Okay, everybody.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.201
Grab a book and a seat.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.103
William.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.906
Rumor has it you're going to
lead Avalon Football to State

10:07.940 --> 10:09.040
for the first time
this year.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.775
Yeah!

10:10.809 --> 10:12.210
That's the plan, sir.
That's my boy.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.579
Class president,
Homecoming King,

10:14.613 --> 10:16.915
straight-A student,
and he's polite.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.685
If only I had an entire
class full of Will Wagners.

10:20.719 --> 10:22.520
I think
I'm going to puke.

10:24.857 --> 10:25.990
What're you looking at?

10:26.025 --> 10:27.225
Here you go.

10:30.729 --> 10:32.797
I'm sorry, is there
a problem, Miss...

10:33.032 --> 10:35.099
Pennington.
Allie Pennington.

10:36.001 --> 10:38.703
Ah!
That explains everything!

10:40.206 --> 10:43.942
Everyone, please welcome
Avalon High's newest student,

10:43.976 --> 10:45.009
Allie Pennington.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.213
That's about all you're gonna get. Yeah.

10:48.247 --> 10:52.550
Allie's parents are professors of
medieval literature at the university,

10:52.585 --> 10:57.155
and they also wrote the textbook
we'll be using this semester,

10:57.189 --> 10:59.624
when we learn about King
Arthur and his court.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.759
Easy A!

11:02.695 --> 11:03.962
Nobody asked you.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.567
Hi. I'm Allie.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.704
No. No, no, no, no, no. Avert your eyes.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.205
Excuse me?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.975
You're making a tactical error of
monumental proportions right now.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.676
By sitting at my desk?

11:18.711 --> 11:19.811
By talking to me.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.212
I mean, come on!
You had a great start.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.581
I saw you talking to Captain
Everything this morning.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.116
You have a chance
to be in the popular group.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.451
Don't mess it up.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.019
I can be friends
with whoever I want.

11:28.053 --> 11:29.287
Including you.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.788
Who said I wanted
to be your friend?

11:30.823 --> 11:32.290
You.
No, I didn't.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.259
Then why are you still
talking to me? But I'm not.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.829
Ah, but by saying you're not
talking to me, you are talking to me.

11:37.863 --> 11:38.763
Check and mate.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.836
Okay, first thing
we're going to do

11:44.870 --> 11:49.007
is to break up into teams
to write research papers.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.976
You'll draw your topics
out of this.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.148
Courtney,
you're with Todd.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.087
The architecture
of Camelot.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.188
Interesting.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.858
Will, you're with Karen.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.859
Can't I be with Jen?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.761
No, Jen is with Lance.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.870
Ah.
How apropos.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.638
The sports
of Camelot.

12:20.939 --> 12:22.140
Jennifer.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.912
The tragedy of Camelot.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.082
Your paper is gonna be
about the love triangle

12:31.116 --> 12:34.686
between King Arthur, his wife Guinevere,
and his best friend, Sir Lancelot.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.656
Ultimately, it destroyed
Arthur and Camelot itself.

12:40.793 --> 12:41.893
Bit of a downer.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.029
Miles, you're with Allie.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.230
I'd rather work alone.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.633
I'd rather be eating
pineapple on a beach in Hawaii,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.068
but that's not going
to happen either.

12:51.236 --> 12:52.937
Fine.
I guess she'll do.

12:52.971 --> 12:54.839
Wow. Thanks.

12:54.873 --> 12:56.040
Pick.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.479
The Order of the Bear.

13:03.248 --> 13:04.615
I've never heard of that.

13:04.650 --> 13:05.917
So much for the easy A.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.585
Ask your parents.

13:07.619 --> 13:09.320
I'm sure they've heard
of the Order.

13:29.007 --> 13:31.175
Miles? Are you okay?

13:31.944 --> 13:34.278
Yeah. I'm fine.
Just tie your shoes.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.181
They are tied.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.983
Then tie your other shoes.

13:39.351 --> 13:40.685
What are you talking about?

13:40.719 --> 13:43.054
Just tie your shoes, okay?
What am I, your mother?

13:45.924 --> 13:47.091
Hmm.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.131
Timed 400 meter!
Top three make the team!

13:53.165 --> 13:54.665
Come on.
Let's go!

14:04.176 --> 14:05.243
Shoes all tied-y tied-y?

14:23.195 --> 14:24.362
Take your marks!
Hut!

14:31.503 --> 14:32.804
Set!

14:33.372 --> 14:34.972
Good job, brother!

15:22.554 --> 15:26.057
That was one of the fastest
400s we've seen in years.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.861
Welcome to Avalon
High Varsity Track.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.996
Thank you.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.465
Okay, we'll see you here
tomorrow, 4:00 p. m.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.468
Andrea, you and Jenny,
you also. Congratulations.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.537
Well done.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.374
Coach said I almost
broke the school record.

15:43.408 --> 15:44.709
In tryouts!

15:44.743 --> 15:45.977
That's amazing,
sweetheart.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.311
We're so proud of you.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.779
I'm proud of me, too.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.414
You really like it here,
don't you, sweetie?

15:50.949 --> 15:53.317
Yeah, I do. I feel like this
is where we're meant to be.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.256
So. Did you make
some new friends today?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.390
A few.

15:59.424 --> 16:01.325
What's with that smile?
Did you see that smile?

16:01.360 --> 16:02.693
I saw it.

16:04.329 --> 16:07.498
So, did someone
float your boat?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.534
"Float my boat"?
What year is this?

16:10.202 --> 16:12.203
He means,
did you fancy anyone?

16:12.237 --> 16:14.705
"Fancy"? Really, you guys. Century-up.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.207
I think she's
dodging the question.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.375
Absolutely

16:17.643 --> 16:19.544
Oh! I'll get it!

16:21.046 --> 16:22.046
Who could that be?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.850
Miles. What are
you doing here?

16:25.884 --> 16:26.951
We have a paper due.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.419
In three weeks.

16:28.453 --> 16:31.122
I don't like to dilly-dally.
Do you want to do this or not?

16:31.156 --> 16:32.256
I guess.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.926
Allie, do you want to
introduce us to your friend?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.595
Oh, yeah. This is Miles.
We're doing a paper together.

16:37.629 --> 16:40.131
Nice to meet you, young man. Come on in.

16:48.273 --> 16:49.707
I don't understand.
What's the...

16:49.741 --> 16:52.376
Seems like a nice guy.
Reminds me of me.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.911
Miles, do you
want some pie?

16:56.114 --> 16:59.450
Can we just find the book we're going
to use and call it a night, Miles?

16:59.484 --> 17:01.085
We have a lot of time
to do this.

17:01.119 --> 17:03.521
I always do my assignments
in half the time allotted.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.689
Why?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.457
To prove that I'm better
than everyone else.

17:06.491 --> 17:08.092
And more modest.
That, too.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.127
That was sarcasm.

17:10.862 --> 17:12.296
How is it sarcasm
if you're right?

17:13.265 --> 17:14.397
Never mind.

17:16.568 --> 17:20.570
Okay. I cannot find anything on
The Order of the Bear anywhere.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.273
Can't we just
ask your parents?

17:23.308 --> 17:24.976
Are you kidding?

17:25.010 --> 17:28.579
If I tell them I'm doing a paper on King
Arthur, they'll never leave me alone.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.748
No, no,
I will find it myself.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.921
I wonder what
they ate in Camelot.

17:36.955 --> 17:39.490
Mutton,
with a side of beets.

17:39.524 --> 17:42.593
Mmm. And sage water,
but only from the north.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.497
I didn't even know
I knew that!

17:47.232 --> 17:49.166
It must've seeped
in subconsciously

17:49.201 --> 17:52.269
while my parents were going
on and on about King Arthur.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.205
And on and on.
And on.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.476
Miles?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.911
You have any ice?

18:00.946 --> 18:02.313
Yeah, yeah.
It's in the freezer.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.081
Here,
I'll get it for you.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.218
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:07.252 --> 18:08.352
Here you go.
Back to work.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.487
What?

18:12.190 --> 18:14.325
How did you know I was
going to need some ice?

18:14.359 --> 18:15.660
Coincidence.

18:16.428 --> 18:20.431
No, you did the same thing
earlier with the shoelaces.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.500
It's not that hard to guess.
You seem pretty clumsy.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.335
But...
Just drop it, okay?

18:26.538 --> 18:28.172
You got it.

18:28.206 --> 18:29.440
Thank you.

18:29.808 --> 18:33.144
Now, can't we just ask your parents
about this Order of the Bear thing

18:33.178 --> 18:34.145
and save some time?

18:35.614 --> 18:36.981
Fine.

18:40.052 --> 18:43.421
The Order of
the Bear. Anyone?

18:43.455 --> 18:45.189
Have you
heard of it?

19:01.606 --> 19:04.141
Whoa.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.244
Jackpot!

19:08.246 --> 19:11.382
The Order of the Bear
is an ancient organization,

19:11.416 --> 19:15.219
which believes that King Arthur
will one day be reincarnated.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.723
Right. And when is
this going to happen?

19:18.757 --> 19:20.858
Arthur will return
when he is truly needed

19:20.892 --> 19:22.560
to bring the world
out of the dark

19:22.594 --> 19:25.229
and into a new age
of enlightenment.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.064
You mean
bring back Camelot?

19:28.066 --> 19:29.066
It's a metaphor.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.367
You can't
be sure.

19:30.402 --> 19:32.303
I'm pretty sure.
He can't be sure.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.674
But even as a
piece of fiction,

19:36.708 --> 19:39.009
it's actually
quite interesting.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.579
Let's see. Ah!

19:42.380 --> 19:43.748
"As the keepers
of the prophecy,

19:43.782 --> 19:45.416
"it falls to
members of the Order

19:45.450 --> 19:48.586
"to search for potential Arthurs
in each and every generation.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.254
"But beware the Dark Forces.

19:50.288 --> 19:52.356
"Led by a reincarnation
of Mordred,

19:52.390 --> 19:55.192
"determined to find the
next Arthur and destroy him

19:55.227 --> 19:57.895
"before he can realize the
prophecy. " What they're saying...

19:57.929 --> 19:59.363
If Arthur isn't
found soon,

19:59.397 --> 20:02.266
Mordred and his followers will
send us back into the DarAges.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.635
Ignorance, humiliation, suffering...

20:04.669 --> 20:07.204
High school.

20:11.476 --> 20:12.610
It's no joke, Allie.

20:17.582 --> 20:19.784
Some more seriously
than others.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.024
Some people are
fanatics about it.

20:27.058 --> 20:29.059
Crazy. You're not.
We're not.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.364
Here, read. There's a lot
of good stuff in there.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.665
Refresh your memory.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.569
Okay. Mom's mad.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.115
Camelot.

21:42.267 --> 21:46.136
Okay. Tomorrow, we'll be talking about
sewage systems in King Arthur's day.

21:46.171 --> 21:49.473
So, if I were you, I'd plan
on eating a light lunch.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.143
Allie?
Yeah?

21:53.178 --> 21:56.647
Were you able to find some information
on the Order from your parents?

21:56.681 --> 21:59.516
True to form, they had a
dusty, 50-pound book about it.

21:59.551 --> 22:01.218
Fascinating! Ha!

22:01.720 --> 22:03.554
Did you read the prophecy? Mmm-hmm.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.256
What did you think?

22:05.624 --> 22:08.559
I don't know. The whole
"reincarnation of King Arthur" thing

22:08.593 --> 22:10.694
is a little far-fetched,
don't you think?

22:10.729 --> 22:13.397
It's only far-fetched
if it isn't true.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.901
Don't tell me
you believe in it, too?

22:17.469 --> 22:18.669
Oh, absolutely!

22:19.704 --> 22:24.341
You're a very lucky girl to be
able to read the prophecy firsthand.

22:24.376 --> 22:27.645
I could bring in the book for
you, if you want to see it.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.115
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't
ask you to do that.

22:31.149 --> 22:34.218
A book like that must be so fragile.
I'd be afraid of damaging it!

22:34.252 --> 22:37.655
Yeah. It's probably just best
to leave it right where it is.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.323
Just thought I'd ask.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.658
Okay.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.533
What did he want?
Are you in trouble?

22:49.567 --> 22:51.468
I don't want to be friends
with a troublemaker.

22:51.503 --> 22:54.104
Miles, are you finally
admitting we're friends?

22:54.139 --> 22:55.506
I admit nothing.

23:05.850 --> 23:07.785
Just tell me
what Moore wanted.

23:07.819 --> 23:10.688
He just wanted to talk
about the Order of the Bear.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.590
Wow. Informal,
post-class chit-chat.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.293
Way to pull the Teacher's Pet
spot out from underneath me.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.795
Some friend you
turned out to be.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.296
Bye, Miles.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.198
Where are you going?
The cafeteria.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.201
Do you wanna
come with me?

23:24.235 --> 23:25.202
Okay.

24:37.308 --> 24:38.342
Hi.

24:38.576 --> 24:40.010
Hi.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.646
Is this yours?
Yeah, it blew away.

24:42.847 --> 24:45.215
Right to me.
Must be fate.

24:49.487 --> 24:50.654
Thanks.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.991
So, what are you
doing out here?

24:54.025 --> 24:57.394
Running, thinking.
Running and thinking.

24:58.296 --> 24:59.897
This is obviously
the thinking part.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.832
I figured.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.635
Okay. Well, I'll
leave you alone, then.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.837
No, it's okay.
Stay.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.748
You know, most people just run
right by this part of the forest,

25:17.782 --> 25:19.783
but it's great in here.

25:21.119 --> 25:24.254
Listen, hear the wind
in the trees.

25:25.723 --> 25:27.257
It's like music.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.895
Football players aren't
supposed to talk like that.

25:32.397 --> 25:33.697
You're making fun of me?

25:34.732 --> 25:36.433
No, no.
I didn't mean to.

25:36.468 --> 25:37.935
No, hey, it's just...

25:37.969 --> 25:40.637
It seems like all people can
talk to me about is football.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.975
Okay. Well, what else do
you want to talk about?

25:47.245 --> 25:48.579
See?
That's the problem.

25:48.613 --> 25:49.813
I can't think
of anything else.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.290
Can I tell you something?

26:04.496 --> 26:07.931
Football used to mean everything
to me. I loved the game.

26:08.533 --> 26:09.666
But now everyone's
counting on me to

26:09.701 --> 26:11.602
win the championship,
and get my scholarship.

26:11.636 --> 26:14.404
You're getting a football
scholarship? That's amazing!

26:14.439 --> 26:19.443
I don't have one yet. But
I need one, or no college.

26:19.777 --> 26:21.311
No pressure there.

26:34.058 --> 26:37.528
You're a great athlete.
Everybody knows that.

26:37.562 --> 26:42.032
And all great athletes have
pressure on them all the time.

26:42.066 --> 26:45.536
You can't be afraid of it.
You have to embrace it.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.440
And the way you do that is to
remember what victory felt like,

26:50.775 --> 26:53.844
that feeling when you
lead your team to glory.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.212
And if you can live
in that moment

26:55.246 --> 26:58.515
and want it again
with all your heart,

26:58.550 --> 27:00.083
nothing can stop you.

27:01.719 --> 27:03.954
Wow. That was...

27:06.691 --> 27:07.724
Thank you.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.894
I don't know where
that came from.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.097
What if I lose?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.135
Then maybe State
wasn't meant to be.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.870
Not the answer
I was hoping for.

27:19.904 --> 27:22.172
Sorry.
I just mean...

27:22.207 --> 27:24.741
Maybe everything
happens for a reason.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.043
You think so?

27:26.077 --> 27:29.746
I didn't,
but I'm starting to.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.391
Wow.

27:41.426 --> 27:42.993
You guys have been
together for a while, huh?

27:43.595 --> 27:44.962
Almost three years.

27:45.730 --> 27:46.597
Don't ask.

27:47.732 --> 27:48.765
Ask what?

27:49.100 --> 27:51.001
Why I didn't
answer the phone.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.605
Hey, want to run
some more?

27:54.639 --> 27:55.806
Sure.

27:56.074 --> 28:00.811
Oh. Uh, wait. I forgot. My
dad's making burgers for dinner.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.813
Burgers, huh?
Sounds good.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.414
Yeah, they are.

28:05.950 --> 28:09.453
Yep, my dad makes some
pretty good burgers there.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.690
Oh, wait. Did you want
to come over for burgers?

28:13.725 --> 28:16.560
Just as friends. So, it'd just
be like... Like a friend-burger.

28:18.396 --> 28:21.098
Yeah, I would love
a "friend-burger. "

28:24.969 --> 28:28.071
Ah. Perfect.
There we go. Good.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.706
Oh, I got that, sir.

28:29.741 --> 28:31.108
Oh, yeah. Ohh.
Thank you.

28:31.142 --> 28:32.643
No problem. Yeah. Thanks.

28:33.945 --> 28:37.281
Will, you're welcome here
any time. You're wonderful.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.182
Mom, please!

28:39.651 --> 28:42.653
What? He's class president, the
quarterback and Homecoming King.

28:42.687 --> 28:43.854
He's very impressive.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.589
Very impressive.

28:46.424 --> 28:47.524
One of the professors
told me that

28:47.558 --> 28:49.126
you really helped
turn the team around.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.262
Not to mention bringing a lot
of pride back to the school.

28:52.297 --> 28:55.399
"His broad clear brow
in sunlight glow'd;

28:55.433 --> 28:57.834
"On burnish'd hooves
his war-horse trode;

28:57.869 --> 28:59.936
"From underneath
his helmet flow'd

28:59.971 --> 29:03.373
"His coal-black curls
as on he rode... "

29:03.408 --> 29:05.342
"As he rode down
to Camelot. "

29:06.711 --> 29:09.746
It's a poem about how Arthur
became the leader Britain needed.

29:09.781 --> 29:13.050
Seems like Will did the
same thing for Avalon High.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.818
I don't know how things
are at your house,

29:14.852 --> 29:18.021
but around here, dinner just isn't
complete without a King Arthur poem.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.794
Excuse me.
Oh.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.098
Would you like
some lettuce?

29:30.835 --> 29:32.069
We're all good.
We're all good.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.805
Try some of the potato
salad. Mom made it.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.579
Thanks for dinner.
Anytime.

29:42.613 --> 29:46.216
You know, if you're out running
and get hungry or whatever.

29:52.824 --> 29:55.892
There's a party at my house after
Friday's game. You should come.

29:55.927 --> 29:56.960
Sure.
I'd love to.

30:00.765 --> 30:01.998
I'd better go.

30:02.033 --> 30:03.467
Yeah.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.037
Hey, Jen.
How are you?

30:14.178 --> 30:16.913
So? Did he ask you
on a date?

30:16.948 --> 30:20.417
No! We're just friends.
Those were friend-burgers!

30:20.451 --> 30:22.919
Okay. Sure. Just friends. Got it.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.056
Seriously! I just gave him a
football pep talk, that's it.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.892
Well, if you say that's
it, I guess that's it.

30:29.861 --> 30:31.962
Good. Okay.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.931
That's not it. No.

30:40.700 --> 30:46.237
<i>Ready? Down.
28, set. Hut!</i>

30:50.476 --> 30:51.776
<i>Second.
Long on the 35.</i>

30:51.811 --> 30:54.312
<i>Wagner fakes left
under pressure.</i>

30:54.346 --> 30:58.216
<i>He throws deep to a wide-open
Benwick. He makes the catch.</i>

30:58.250 --> 30:59.918
<i>He breaks the tackle.</i>

30:59.952 --> 31:03.188
<i>I don't know how he kept his
feet inbounds on that one.</i>

31:03.222 --> 31:04.889
<i>But he's still going.</i>

31:05.291 --> 31:06.691
<i>Touchdown Knights!</i>

31:09.495 --> 31:10.829
Yeah!

31:12.932 --> 31:14.699
Go Knights!

31:18.404 --> 31:20.205
Go, Knights!
Go, Knights! Yeah!

31:21.240 --> 31:24.209
<i>With a win over the last
place Crusaders next week,</i>

31:24.243 --> 31:27.445
<i>Will Wagner and his Knights clinch
a trip to the State Championship.</i>

31:30.883 --> 31:32.317
Will! Way to go!

31:32.351 --> 31:33.585
Yeah! Come on.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.820
What was that all about?

31:35.855 --> 31:37.355
What was what?

31:38.124 --> 31:41.192
<i>Will Wagner and his go-to
wide-receiver, Lance Benwick,</i>

31:41.227 --> 31:43.728
<i>have put on another clinic
for us here tonight.</i>

31:45.164 --> 31:47.031
Come on, let's go.

31:47.066 --> 31:50.034
Tell me again why I'm at a party
with a bunch of meathead jocks?

31:50.069 --> 31:52.070
I'm a jock, Miles.
Am I a meathead?

31:52.104 --> 31:54.739
No, but this party
is the first step.

31:57.376 --> 31:59.310
Fine, then don't come in.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.519
Maybe I can make
a quick appearance.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.470
Hey.
What?

32:26.138 --> 32:27.272
See? People hate me.

32:27.306 --> 32:31.042
Miles, try to smile and be
friendly. Just this once.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.377
See what happens.

32:36.382 --> 32:38.116
See?
Now go talk to her.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.818
Talk to who?

32:39.852 --> 32:42.153
Miles, give it up. You
obviously like that girl.

32:42.588 --> 32:45.790
She's so pale. It's weird.
She's probably a vampire.

32:45.825 --> 32:47.859
Teenage vampires are, like,
everywhere these days.

32:47.893 --> 32:49.060
So, you're not gonna
go talk to her?

32:49.094 --> 32:50.495
Nope.

32:50.629 --> 32:53.398
And this has nothing to do with
you being afraid of being rejected?

32:53.799 --> 32:56.134
Why should I care if
I'm rejected by a vampire?

32:57.369 --> 32:59.137
I give up.

33:02.441 --> 33:04.142
Hey, what's going on?

33:04.410 --> 33:06.110
Your friends are wimps.

33:06.512 --> 33:09.347
We seem to have a slight
pest control problem.

33:09.381 --> 33:11.482
Then I guess we'd better
get rid of the pests. Mmm.

33:11.517 --> 33:13.818
Dude, you're
ruining the party.

33:15.154 --> 33:18.022
Need your little goons to save
you from the scary candy bugs?

33:18.057 --> 33:21.025
No, I need them to stop me from
doing something I'll regret.

33:23.662 --> 33:27.699
The only thing I regret
is my mom marrying your dad.

33:33.272 --> 33:34.839
Let's go, guys.

33:34.874 --> 33:36.174
This party's a dud.

33:36.508 --> 33:38.176
They even let
the uber-nerds in.

33:38.377 --> 33:40.945
Oh, yeah. When I'm at
Yale and you're in jail,

33:40.980 --> 33:43.081
I'll be sure to tell
everyone how cool you are.

33:46.151 --> 33:49.087
Hey, Allie.
Sorry about that.

33:49.321 --> 33:51.489
Marco, he's complicated.

33:51.523 --> 33:53.057
What's his problem,
anyway?

33:53.092 --> 33:55.760
He's just really angry. That
his dad died five years ago,

33:55.794 --> 33:58.263
that his mom married my dad, that I'm...

33:59.331 --> 34:01.799
I can tell why he might
be a little jealous, Will.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.534
You're kind of perfect.

34:05.304 --> 34:08.206
I mean,
your game was perfect.

34:09.208 --> 34:12.409
Hey, I only got through that
game because of what you said.

34:12.444 --> 34:13.911
Thank you.

34:18.050 --> 34:21.152
I really should
go find Jen.

34:21.353 --> 34:23.087
Yeah. Of course.

34:25.157 --> 34:26.424
Miles!

34:27.159 --> 34:28.458
You okay, man?

34:28.494 --> 34:30.228
Yeah, I'm okay.
Fine...

34:31.429 --> 34:32.630
You will be, too.

34:34.266 --> 34:35.733
Uh, thanks.

34:36.467 --> 34:37.936
I think.

34:39.138 --> 34:40.438
See you later, Allie.

34:41.139 --> 34:42.273
Bye.

34:45.043 --> 34:46.377
What was that
all about, Miles?

34:46.411 --> 34:47.812
Are you really okay?

34:47.846 --> 34:49.746
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just...

34:50.516 --> 34:52.116
Socializing makes me dizzy.

34:52.150 --> 34:55.085
Well, I'm gonna go try
to find a bathroom, okay?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.522
Don't faint or anything
if someone says hello.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.357
I'm starting to
worry about you.

35:43.168 --> 35:45.069
Your eyes are
so gorgeous.

35:45.104 --> 35:46.671
It's going to be
so much fun.

35:55.214 --> 35:56.280
Oh.

35:56.315 --> 35:59.017
Allie, wait!
I want to talk to you.

35:59.051 --> 36:00.618
Allie, please!

36:01.620 --> 36:04.856
It's none of my business,
Jen. Allie, please.

36:06.658 --> 36:08.526
Please,
don't tell Will.

36:08.761 --> 36:10.228
Don't tell Will that
he's being lied to

36:10.262 --> 36:12.196
by the two people
he trusts the most?

36:12.231 --> 36:13.664
It's more complicated
than that.

36:13.699 --> 36:15.366
It really isn't,
actually.

36:16.135 --> 36:20.738
Allie, I love Will. I'll always
love him. Lance does, too.

36:21.206 --> 36:23.574
The three of us, we've been
best friends since first grade.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.176
The last thing we
want to do is hurt him.

36:25.210 --> 36:26.644
That's why we haven't
told him yet.

36:26.678 --> 36:30.214
If he found out now,
everything would fall apart.

36:31.016 --> 36:33.851
It would be like
what happened in Camelot.

36:35.521 --> 36:36.587
What did you just say?

36:37.523 --> 36:39.257
You know, the story
in Moore's class.

36:39.291 --> 36:40.525
When King Arthur
found out that

36:40.559 --> 36:41.993
Guinevere and Lancelot
were together...

36:42.027 --> 36:44.028
He lost all faith in
everything and everyone,

36:44.063 --> 36:45.596
and didn't have
the strength to go on.

36:46.465 --> 36:47.965
And Will has so much at stake right now,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.701
with the championships
and the scholarship.

36:50.736 --> 36:52.303
We can't destroy him
like this.

36:53.305 --> 36:54.539
"We"?

36:54.573 --> 36:56.874
I wasn't the one
kissing Lance.

36:58.811 --> 37:02.480
Allie, we didn't mean
for this to happen.

37:03.382 --> 37:05.049
It just did.

37:06.685 --> 37:09.287
Lance and I are just
meant to be together.

37:10.089 --> 37:12.056
Haven't you ever felt that?

37:15.094 --> 37:16.761
So, you won't tell him?

37:17.729 --> 37:19.630
You'll let us do it
when the time is right?

37:22.401 --> 37:24.335
I'll have to
think about it.

37:26.305 --> 37:27.438
Al...

37:38.784 --> 37:42.186
So you gonna tell Will
about Jen and Lance, or what?

37:42.221 --> 37:43.588
How did you know?

37:47.259 --> 37:48.960
I had a feeling.

37:50.362 --> 37:51.429
Never mind.

38:11.617 --> 38:13.351
Hey, man.
Hey, how's it going?

38:13.385 --> 38:14.452
Good.

38:36.241 --> 38:37.308
Hey, Allie!

38:39.211 --> 38:42.346
Hey, you took off so early from
the party. Didn't you have fun?

38:42.381 --> 38:43.347
Uh...

38:46.818 --> 38:48.519
I was feeling
a little sick.

38:49.188 --> 38:51.222
Oh. Are you okay now?

38:52.624 --> 38:54.492
It comes and it goes.

38:56.662 --> 38:57.862
I should get to class.

39:03.802 --> 39:05.136
Hey.

39:05.170 --> 39:06.404
Hey, save me a seat.

39:09.541 --> 39:10.575
I brought the book.

39:12.110 --> 39:14.812
Oh, no, Allie,
you shouldn't have.

39:14.846 --> 39:16.647
I meant what I said
about keeping it safe.

39:16.682 --> 39:17.715
It's far too valuable.

39:17.749 --> 39:19.784
Mr. Moore, my parents
said it's fine,

39:19.818 --> 39:21.419
as long as I bring it
home with me tonight.

39:21.453 --> 39:22.820
Say no more.
I'll look at it right now

39:22.854 --> 39:24.488
and give it back
at the end of class.

39:24.523 --> 39:25.623
Thank you.

39:25.891 --> 39:28.859
You've made an old Arthur buff
very happy. Thank you, Allie.

39:30.462 --> 39:32.997
Okay. Change in plans.
We're watching a video today.

39:37.236 --> 39:38.736
<i>Below the tower,</i>

39:38.770 --> 39:40.938
<i>on the upper terrace
of the castle,</i>

39:40.973 --> 39:44.375
<i>his son, Phillip, the
young bridegroom to be,</i>

39:44.409 --> 39:47.044
<i>practices swordsmanship
with his squire.</i>

39:48.313 --> 39:51.916
<i>Someday, he is to become
the Lord of the Manor,</i>

39:51.950 --> 39:54.785
<i>to whom the villagers
will pay their homage,</i>

39:55.687 --> 39:58.222
<i>as he in turn
honors his protector.</i>

40:02.327 --> 40:06.731
<i>Riding to battle with him is a
vassal, in the tradition of the time.</i>

40:12.738 --> 40:17.341
The pages on the timing of the
reincarnation were positively enlightening.

40:17.376 --> 40:19.343
Thanks again
for bringing it in.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.812
No problem. And hey, if you
ever want to talk Arthur,

40:21.847 --> 40:24.315
I'm sure my parents would
be happy to hold you hostage.

40:24.349 --> 40:26.250
I mean,
have you for dinner.

40:26.285 --> 40:27.952
Oh! Yeah.

40:27.986 --> 40:29.687
I may have to
take them up on that.

40:31.256 --> 40:33.357
All right,
everyone. Out.

40:35.027 --> 40:37.395
I don't know how things
were at your last school,

40:37.429 --> 40:39.597
but around here, you can't
get any higher than an "A."

40:39.631 --> 40:41.265
So, you can stop
trying so hard.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.401
It's called being nice,
Miles. You should try it,

40:43.435 --> 40:46.337
instead of hiding your
insecurities behind your snark.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.009
Hey, Allie.

40:52.044 --> 40:53.444
Hey.

40:59.885 --> 41:01.619
I know you know.

41:02.587 --> 41:03.621
Know what?

41:04.923 --> 41:08.659
That Lance and Jen are cheating
on my jerk of a stepbrother.

41:08.927 --> 41:12.063
If you know what's good for you,
you won't say anything to Will.

41:12.831 --> 41:15.700
I haven't said anything,
and I don't plan to.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.935
But not because
you're threatening me.

41:17.969 --> 41:19.704
I have my own reasons.
Oh.

41:20.272 --> 41:22.440
I don't care what
your reasons are,

41:22.474 --> 41:26.077
just keep your mouth shut and
stay out of my way. Or else.

41:50.769 --> 41:51.902
Allie!

41:52.637 --> 41:53.704
Oh. Hi.

41:54.706 --> 41:56.874
Hey, you've been avoiding
me ever since my party.

41:56.908 --> 41:58.209
Did I do something wrong?

41:59.644 --> 42:03.147
No, no. It's just... You know,
I've had a lot on my mind.

42:03.949 --> 42:05.816
So, you're sure
it's nothing I did?

42:06.618 --> 42:09.387
No. It's definitely
nothing you did.

42:10.622 --> 42:11.589
Good.

42:12.357 --> 42:14.024
So, you want to
run with me?

42:15.627 --> 42:16.694
Sure.

42:17.763 --> 42:19.897
What do you want to do?
Like, three miles?

42:19.931 --> 42:22.066
I was thinking five.
If you can handle it.

42:52.564 --> 42:53.631
Race you to the corner.

42:53.665 --> 42:54.899
Okay.

43:11.650 --> 43:12.783
Oh!

43:13.852 --> 43:15.619
You are seriously fast.

43:15.654 --> 43:17.455
Maybe we should draft you
for next season.

43:17.489 --> 43:20.090
Oh, I'm not a big fan
of shoulder pads.

43:20.125 --> 43:21.459
Enough said.

43:25.063 --> 43:26.730
What's this for?

43:26.965 --> 43:29.500
Nothing. I just thought you'd like it.

43:29.534 --> 43:30.868
It's no biggie.

43:31.636 --> 43:32.970
Oh. Okay.

43:33.839 --> 43:35.139
Well, thanks.

43:37.576 --> 43:38.876
It's weird.

43:40.145 --> 43:42.379
You're so
easy to talk to.

43:42.414 --> 43:43.781
It's like...
What?

43:44.716 --> 43:47.518
It's like we were already
friends before we met.

43:47.552 --> 43:49.320
Does that make
any sense?

43:50.722 --> 43:51.956
Never mind. It's crazy.

43:51.990 --> 43:54.825
No. No.
I thought the same thing.

43:56.127 --> 43:58.128
But I don't really know
anything about you.

43:59.130 --> 44:00.564
Well, what do you
want to know?

44:02.267 --> 44:03.868
What do you want to
do with your life?

44:06.037 --> 44:08.038
I don't know.

44:09.007 --> 44:10.908
I'll probably end up
doing something in law.

44:11.176 --> 44:13.577
I'm really big on fairness. I just...

44:13.612 --> 44:15.579
I can't stand people
who think they can get away

44:15.614 --> 44:17.481
with doing something
they know is wrong.

44:17.516 --> 44:18.649
Like what?

44:20.752 --> 44:23.621
Like people
who cut in line.

44:23.655 --> 44:26.724
Seriously, they shouldn't even
get what they want if they cut.

44:26.758 --> 44:29.927
What, so if you're in line for
a movie and I just got my ticket,

44:29.961 --> 44:33.063
and as I'm on my way to the very,
very back of the line, I see you.

44:33.098 --> 44:34.565
Can I get in line with you?

44:34.599 --> 44:35.766
Nope.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.501
Wow. You're tough.

44:38.670 --> 44:39.970
Tough but fair.

44:40.705 --> 44:43.574
When I go into politics,
that's how I want to be.

44:43.608 --> 44:46.377
Is that what you want to do?
Be a politician?

44:46.411 --> 44:49.313
Not "a" politician.
"The" politician.

44:50.148 --> 44:52.616
I'm thinking President
of the United States.

44:54.152 --> 44:55.252
Whoa.

44:55.287 --> 44:57.721
Yeah, I know, it's crazy to
even joke about it, right?

44:58.623 --> 45:01.725
No. I can totally see it.

45:05.964 --> 45:07.031
Race you back to school.

45:08.934 --> 45:10.200
You're on.

45:21.913 --> 45:23.781
Hey!
No shortcuts.

45:23.815 --> 45:24.982
Why not?

45:25.750 --> 45:27.785
We're number one,
you're number two.

45:27.819 --> 45:30.154
We're gonna beat
the socks off of you.

45:30.188 --> 45:31.789
<i>No one thought
it was possible,</i>

45:31.823 --> 45:33.824
<i>but the Crusaders have
just tied the game up.</i>

45:35.627 --> 45:36.994
Yeah!

45:37.028 --> 45:39.029
<i>We're even at 14,
late in the fourth quarter.</i>

45:39.064 --> 45:40.331
Ready? Let's give
them something

45:40.365 --> 45:41.832
to think about
on the bus ride home.

45:41.866 --> 45:44.234
Fake 26, on one.
Ready?

45:49.774 --> 45:50.975
Uh-oh.

45:51.009 --> 45:52.109
What?

45:52.143 --> 45:53.510
That's gonna hurt.

45:53.545 --> 45:54.511
Ready!

45:55.113 --> 45:56.480
Down!

45:56.514 --> 45:59.183
Let's go, Will!
Let's go, Will!

45:59.217 --> 46:01.251
15, 36, set,

46:01.286 --> 46:02.386
hut!

46:03.922 --> 46:05.723
<i>Wagner dropping back.</i>

46:07.459 --> 46:11.028
<i>What a hit! Intercepted at the 40-yard
line. He's at the ten, the five...</i>

46:11.062 --> 46:13.297
<i>Touchdown Crusaders.
I can't believe it.</i>

46:13.932 --> 46:15.633
Will, you okay?
Dude, where was your block?

46:15.667 --> 46:17.134
You left him wide open!

46:17.168 --> 46:18.168
I know, okay?
I messed up!

46:18.203 --> 46:19.236
What were
you thinking?

46:19.270 --> 46:20.671
I'm sorry.

46:20.705 --> 46:23.340
What was so important you couldn't
keep your mind on the game?

46:23.375 --> 46:25.009
I get it if you hate me.
You should hate me.

46:25.043 --> 46:28.312
I don't hate you. Just do your
job, okay? Make the stupid block.

46:28.346 --> 46:30.147
Whatever you say,
Your Highness.

46:31.616 --> 46:33.684
Did Lance just
bow at Will?

46:33.718 --> 46:34.952
I don't know.

46:34.986 --> 46:36.687
<i>The only chance
the Knights have now,</i>

46:36.721 --> 46:38.489
<i>is for the defense to
block the extra point</i>

46:38.523 --> 46:39.790
<i>and run it back for a TD.</i>

46:39.824 --> 46:42.059
Hold that line.
Defense, one more time.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.662
Go, Knights, hold that line.
Defense, one more time.

46:44.696 --> 46:46.163
So much for State.

46:46.197 --> 46:48.265
Hey, guys, come on.
Believe in it.

46:48.299 --> 46:50.968
We can still make it if we
beat Northgate. Yeah, right.

46:53.638 --> 46:55.406
<i>The extra point is good.</i>

46:55.840 --> 46:58.509
We can't beat a bunch of eighth
graders the way we're playing.

46:58.543 --> 47:00.210
<i>No one thought
it was possible,</i>

47:00.245 --> 47:02.646
<i>but the Knights have been
upset by the Crusaders.</i>

47:02.681 --> 47:04.715
<i>With this loss, Will
Wagner and his teammates</i>

47:04.749 --> 47:07.251
<i>have to beat the
undefeated Dragons next week</i>

47:07.285 --> 47:09.620
<i>if they want a ticket
to the State.</i>

47:26.871 --> 47:29.573
Will. Are you okay?

47:30.975 --> 47:32.142
Not really.

47:34.245 --> 47:37.314
I'm pretty sure Lance let
me get sacked on purpose.

47:37.348 --> 47:39.450
Like he wanted me
to get hurt.

47:40.819 --> 47:42.920
But then,
why would he do that?

47:43.722 --> 47:47.091
Here's the thing. And
this isn't easy. I just...

47:47.125 --> 47:49.026
Hey there,
superstar.

47:49.327 --> 47:51.095
Way to take a hit
like a girl.

47:51.129 --> 47:52.162
Bet the scouts
loved that.

47:52.197 --> 47:53.397
Dude, get out of here.

47:53.431 --> 47:56.700
Can't. Your dad said
you'd give me a lift.

48:00.805 --> 48:04.808
Can I call you later? You can finish
what you were going to tell me?

48:05.944 --> 48:07.311
It's nothing.
I just

48:08.079 --> 48:10.280
wanted to make sure
you were okay.

48:10.315 --> 48:11.815
I'll be fine.

48:12.050 --> 48:13.617
Thanks, Allie.
Really.

48:45.216 --> 48:46.383
Miles!

48:47.152 --> 48:48.719
What are you doing here?

48:48.753 --> 48:49.987
You need help.

48:50.021 --> 48:51.388
How do you know
I need help?

48:51.422 --> 48:53.290
I just know, okay?
Isn't that enough?

48:53.324 --> 48:55.692
No, actually,
it's not enough.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.594
How do you always know
things are going to

48:57.629 --> 48:59.163
happen
before it happens?

48:59.197 --> 49:00.798
Like the shoelaces,
the ice,

49:00.832 --> 49:03.634
the stuff at the football
game, showing up here tonight.

49:03.668 --> 49:05.969
I think you even knew about
Jen and Lance before I did!

49:06.004 --> 49:07.971
What are you,
psychic or something?

49:08.406 --> 49:10.174
Don't say
that word, Allie.

49:12.177 --> 49:14.978
It's okay, Miles.
You can tell me.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.415
No, I can't.
I can't tell anyone.

49:18.449 --> 49:21.819
I'm not just anyone.
I'm your friend.

49:21.853 --> 49:24.755
If you tell me something,
no matter what it is,

49:24.789 --> 49:26.757
I'm going to be there
for you.

49:26.791 --> 49:28.525
Because that's
what friends do.

49:29.994 --> 49:31.161
I just...

49:31.896 --> 49:33.263
I'm already
enough of a nerd, Allie.

49:33.298 --> 49:36.500
The last thing I need is
something else making me different.

49:38.203 --> 49:41.271
Sometimes being different
is what makes us great.

49:47.011 --> 49:48.111
Okay.

49:50.081 --> 49:54.785
So, I've been seeing things, like flashes
of the future, ever since I was a little kid.

49:54.819 --> 49:56.987
Only now it's
gotten stronger.

49:57.021 --> 49:59.356
Now it feels like I'm being
hit in the head with a brick.

49:59.390 --> 50:02.025
And tonight? What happened
to make you come here tonight?

50:02.060 --> 50:04.795
I saw myself sitting here
with you, readinthe book.

50:05.129 --> 50:06.730
Book? What book?

50:06.931 --> 50:10.000
The Order of the Bear
journal. It has a secret page.

50:23.147 --> 50:24.381
Watch out.

50:32.590 --> 50:36.193
I've been through this book, like,
a million times. I never saw this.

50:36.961 --> 50:37.861
Thanks, Miles.

50:39.964 --> 50:42.733
"The King returns anew at the
meeting of the moon's shadowing

50:42.767 --> 50:44.868
"and a million
falling stars. "

50:45.436 --> 50:47.204
What the heck
does that mean?

50:48.506 --> 50:51.875
Maybe the moon's shadowing
is an eclipse?

50:52.744 --> 50:54.578
And a million
falling stars...

50:55.046 --> 50:56.179
A meteor shower?

50:56.447 --> 50:58.382
That's it!
A meteor shower.

50:58.416 --> 51:01.952
So maybe
King Arthur's return is

51:01.986 --> 51:04.922
when an eclipse and a meteor
shower happens on the same day.

51:07.125 --> 51:08.325
No. It can't be.

51:08.359 --> 51:11.762
That only happens, like,
once every 1,000 years.

51:11.796 --> 51:12.796
Oh.

51:13.865 --> 51:14.965
Hold on.

51:17.402 --> 51:21.338
Total eclipse,
meteor shower.

51:24.943 --> 51:28.111
Okay, so it looks like every
1,000 years is next Friday.

51:29.981 --> 51:31.882
The night of the big game?

51:31.916 --> 51:33.583
No, no. It can't be.

51:34.285 --> 51:35.886
Maybe I read it wrong.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.954
Let me see.

51:38.156 --> 51:40.123
It's right here,
in plain English!

51:40.158 --> 51:42.859
Eclipse!
Meteor shower! Same day!

51:45.396 --> 51:47.464
Arthur is coming back.

51:48.299 --> 51:50.734
Arthur is coming back.

51:57.041 --> 52:00.210
"Beware Mordred, Arthur's
half-brother and sworn enemy,

52:00.244 --> 52:01.979
"who is tasked
to destroy Arthur

52:02.013 --> 52:04.147
"before he even knows
himself to be a King. "

52:04.182 --> 52:05.983
"Destroy Arthur"?

52:07.218 --> 52:08.585
As in, permanently?

52:12.957 --> 52:15.325
Dad, quick King Arthur
question for you.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.361
It's for our research paper. Shoot.

52:17.395 --> 52:19.997
Okay. Say King Arthur did come back,

52:20.031 --> 52:22.699
and Mordred came back
to destroy him.

52:22.734 --> 52:23.734
What would he do?

52:24.102 --> 52:26.470
Well, the legend said that
Mordred would try to make

52:26.504 --> 52:28.005
Arthur's perfect world
fall apart.

52:28.039 --> 52:30.941
He would try to make Arthur lose
faith in himself and his destiny,

52:30.975 --> 52:33.877
and he would cause infighting
amongst Arthur's knights.

52:33.911 --> 52:36.847
And he would try to crush
Arthur's spirit so completely,

52:36.881 --> 52:38.749
he would lose
the will to go on.

52:38.783 --> 52:39.783
Nice guy.

52:40.351 --> 52:44.388
I don't know how Mordred would
do it today, but 1,500 years ago,

52:44.422 --> 52:48.525
he did it by telling Arthur that his
wife Guinevere was in love with Lancelot.

52:48.559 --> 52:50.060
Arthur was so upset
and betrayed...

52:50.094 --> 52:52.863
He lost all faith, he didn't
have the strength to go on.

52:52.897 --> 52:53.997
I know.

52:54.032 --> 52:55.432
What is it, honey?

52:56.300 --> 52:59.136
What you just said?
It's happening.

53:01.072 --> 53:04.541
It's Will. Will is the
reincarnation of King Arthur.

53:05.476 --> 53:09.146
I told you, Paul! It's
really him! I knew it!

53:09.180 --> 53:10.514
I told you we were right
to move here!

53:11.382 --> 53:14.084
Whoa, whoa! Wait. We moved
here because of the prophecy?

53:14.519 --> 53:16.553
Um, a little bit.

53:16.587 --> 53:18.955
And you already knew
it was Will?

53:19.190 --> 53:21.992
I had a hunch,
which you just confirmed.

53:22.026 --> 53:25.062
Of course, we won't know for
sure until he wields Excalibur.

53:25.329 --> 53:27.264
Oh. And where is he
supposed to get that?

53:27.298 --> 53:31.034
It says here, any sword in King
Arthur's hand becomes Excalibur.

53:31.069 --> 53:32.269
Pardon?

53:32.303 --> 53:34.171
Any sword in King Arthur's
hand becomes Excalibur.

53:34.972 --> 53:36.907
I know.
But I thought it was cool.

53:37.341 --> 53:38.909
Very cool.

53:39.110 --> 53:41.111
Now we just have to keep
an eye out for Mordred.

53:41.145 --> 53:43.080
Oh, stop.
This is ridiculous.

53:43.114 --> 53:44.915
Even if this were real,
which it isn't,

53:44.949 --> 53:47.484
if Mordred were here, it'd
be very hard to spot him.

53:47.518 --> 53:49.386
Unless, of course, Will
has an evil stepbrother.

53:51.189 --> 53:53.056
I was kidding.

53:53.091 --> 53:54.791
Will has
an evil stepbrother?

53:54.826 --> 53:57.194
Evil doesn't even
begin to describe Marco.

53:58.463 --> 54:00.263
I need to do
some research.

54:00.932 --> 54:04.367
So that's why Marco,
I mean, Mordred,

54:04.402 --> 54:06.470
didn't want me to tell
Will about Jen and Lance!

54:06.504 --> 54:09.906
He wanted to be the one
to ruin Will's life!

54:10.575 --> 54:13.009
Joan! I need you! I need
the book about the thing.

54:13.044 --> 54:14.978
Don't worry, sweetie,
we'll do some more research,

54:15.012 --> 54:17.214
and do everything we can
to help Will stay strong.

54:17.248 --> 54:18.849
Now would be good.

54:24.021 --> 54:26.289
You know what? We don't
have time for more research.

54:26.324 --> 54:28.458
We have to tell Will
so he can defend himself.

54:28.493 --> 54:29.860
Oh, yeah,
that'll be great.

54:29.894 --> 54:31.895
"Will, you're the
reincarnation of King Arthur,

54:31.929 --> 54:33.029
"your step-brother
is Mordred,

54:33.064 --> 54:34.698
"and he's going to
try and destroy you.

54:34.732 --> 54:35.799
"Are you gonna
eat those fries?"

54:35.833 --> 54:38.869
Hmm. Yeah, it's a little
out there, isn't it?

54:38.903 --> 54:41.204
Yeah, we passed out there
about five exits back.

54:41.239 --> 54:44.508
Maybe we should wait until we can
do it without freaking him out.

54:44.542 --> 54:46.176
Good call.

54:46.210 --> 54:49.913
Yeah. But what if Marco tells him
about Jen and Lance before that?

54:49.947 --> 54:52.048
Like your mom said, that's
Mordred's biggest weapon.

54:52.083 --> 54:55.252
He won't use it until he's
sure it's the final blow.

54:55.286 --> 54:57.154
I hope you're right.
Of course I'm...

54:59.390 --> 55:00.924
Miles?

55:00.958 --> 55:05.195
Miles! Wake up!
Say something!

55:07.832 --> 55:10.600
You could really look
into a breath mint.

55:11.369 --> 55:12.802
Did you have a vision?

55:12.837 --> 55:15.305
Yeah. I think I saw Excalibur, but...

55:15.339 --> 55:17.474
Where was it?
What did it look like?

55:17.508 --> 55:20.310
Well, if I saw what
I think I saw, then...

55:21.245 --> 55:22.612
It was pretty awesome.

55:26.517 --> 55:28.318
You know,
if Will is Arthur,

55:28.352 --> 55:30.954
and Marco is Mordred,

55:30.988 --> 55:33.790
maybe you're Merlin the
wizard. Merlin was a psychic.

55:33.824 --> 55:35.859
Doubtful. Merlin had
a long, white beard.

55:35.893 --> 55:37.928
I can barely grow
a nose hair.

55:57.404 --> 55:58.571
Drool much?

55:59.573 --> 56:00.706
You're just jealous.

56:00.741 --> 56:02.875
But then again, you
have been for centuries.

56:02.910 --> 56:04.877
Okay, hurry up.

56:04.912 --> 56:08.347
This is your final test
on King Arthur.

56:09.816 --> 56:10.917
Thank you.
Thank you.

56:10.951 --> 56:14.720
And you have exactly 45 minutes. Begin.

56:27.634 --> 56:30.102
What is that on the bottom of your shoe?

56:30.637 --> 56:31.871
Give it to me.

56:40.747 --> 56:41.781
Looks like a cheat sheet.

56:43.717 --> 56:44.817
That is not mine.

56:44.851 --> 56:46.018
So, what, it just
adhered itself

56:46.053 --> 56:47.453
perfectly to
the bottom of your shoe

56:47.487 --> 56:48.688
all by itself?
No.

56:48.722 --> 56:51.457
Don't lie to me,
Mr. Wagner. How could...

56:51.491 --> 56:53.025
I expect more from you
than this.

56:55.128 --> 56:58.531
Dude, if you get caught cheating,
you're out of the game on Friday.

56:58.565 --> 57:01.400
Mr. Moore, you have to
believe me! I did not cheat!

57:09.609 --> 57:13.679
Because of your spotless record
and service to the school,

57:13.714 --> 57:16.749
I'm going to give you the
benefit of the doubt. This time.

57:17.484 --> 57:18.751
Thank you.
Sit down.

57:19.786 --> 57:20.953
Special treatment.

57:22.022 --> 57:24.390
Quiet.
Back to your tests.

57:43.677 --> 57:45.978
I know it was you who planted
that cheat sheet, Marco.

57:46.013 --> 57:47.980
You don't know anything.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.483
I know more
than you think.

57:56.923 --> 57:59.592
Wagner, it'll be
a 28 sweep on two.

57:59.626 --> 58:00.659
Yes, Coach.

58:02.429 --> 58:04.530
All right. Everyone know the new play?

58:04.564 --> 58:07.266
We don't need to.
We have cheat sheets.

58:10.670 --> 58:11.704
Funny.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.009
Ready.

58:17.778 --> 58:19.812
28 sweep on two.
Ready?

58:19.846 --> 58:21.047
Ready.

58:23.016 --> 58:27.620
Ready.
Down. 20, 45,

58:28.555 --> 58:29.455
hut!

58:44.638 --> 58:45.771
Hut! Hut!

58:50.744 --> 58:52.945
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What
do you think you're doing?

58:52.979 --> 58:54.713
Target practice.

58:54.748 --> 58:55.915
Apologize.

58:55.949 --> 58:57.650
Why? He didn't get hurt. Doesn't matter.

58:57.684 --> 59:00.486
I'm sick of some of you guys
acting like you own the field.

59:00.520 --> 59:02.054
Come on, Will. Just leave it alone. No!

59:02.089 --> 59:04.457
I'm the team captain, and
I'm not happy about this.

59:04.491 --> 59:06.125
Maybe we should find
a new captain.

59:06.159 --> 59:07.693
One with
a sense of humor.

59:07.727 --> 59:09.695
Or maybe one who doesn't cheat on tests.

59:09.729 --> 59:11.530
Yeah.
That's right.

59:32.719 --> 59:33.752
Hey.

59:37.190 --> 59:39.992
Thanks for what you
did out there.

59:40.026 --> 59:41.861
It was about time
someone told that guy off.

59:41.895 --> 59:45.698
Yeah, well, I'm glad someone
thinks I did something right today.

59:49.603 --> 59:51.770
You stood up
for yourself in class,

59:51.805 --> 59:54.039
you stood up for us
out here.

59:54.074 --> 59:58.511
It takes a lot of courage to do what
you do, and you do it all the time.

59:58.545 --> 01:00:00.613
Maybe I should just
start being a jerk,

01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:02.648
then no one will expect
anything from me.

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:06.385
You are constitutionally
incapable of being a jerk.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:14.860
You know who else was brave like
that? Who stood up for people?

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:16.695
King...
Sorry.

01:00:19.099 --> 01:00:21.200
There's something
I've got to try to do.

01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:25.070
But we'll have to talk
later today, okay?

01:00:25.972 --> 01:00:27.106
Okay.

01:00:28.108 --> 01:00:29.375
So, see you.

01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:30.776
See you.

01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:45.958
Okay. Got it? Sure?
Off you go. Yes. Yes.

01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:48.827
Oh!

01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:51.297
Whoa.
Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Moore.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:54.233
My mind is
somewhere else.

01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:57.870
Will Wagner has
that effect on people.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.239
How did you know I was
talking about Will?

01:01:00.273 --> 01:01:02.675
Not that I was.
I wasn't.

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:04.310
Okay.

01:01:04.844 --> 01:01:06.145
I was.
I understand.

01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:08.247
He's a special
young man.

01:01:09.716 --> 01:01:11.584
You have no idea.

01:01:13.954 --> 01:01:15.754
I wish...

01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:17.022
Yes?

01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:20.125
Mr. Moore,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.295
if I tell you something,
you can't tell anyone. Okay?

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:27.633
Whatever it is, you have
my word it'll be between us.

01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:31.070
Allie, what's
on your mind?

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.106
<i>It's about the book,
The Order of the Bear?</i>

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:36.775
Oh, no, I didn't leave a
coffee ring on it, did I?

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.110
No, no. It's fine.

01:01:39.012 --> 01:01:41.046
The thing is,

01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:42.848
we found a secret page.
And it said...

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.752
You're probably not
going to believe this,

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:49.088
but it said the return of
King Arthur is happening now.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:52.491
And I think that...
You think it's Will.

01:01:54.194 --> 01:01:55.361
How did you know?

01:01:55.395 --> 01:01:57.696
I've had
my suspicions.

01:01:57.731 --> 01:02:01.066
If anyone at this school is the
reincarnation of King Arthur,

01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:03.168
it's Will Wagner.

01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:05.671
Amazing, isn't it?

01:02:05.705 --> 01:02:09.174
King Arthur walking the
halls of Avalon High?

01:02:14.447 --> 01:02:17.149
Then does that mean you'll help
me protect Will from Mordred?

01:02:17.183 --> 01:02:18.851
Of course.

01:02:18.885 --> 01:02:21.854
And I assume you have a guess
as to who that is as well?

01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:24.156
I don't think it's
too hard to figure out.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:26.125
I suppose not.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.160
Don't worry, Allie.

01:02:28.194 --> 01:02:31.597
When the day comes
for Arthur to rise again,

01:02:31.631 --> 01:02:34.667
Marco won't stand
in anyone's way.

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.745
Today, we're going to
see if we can create

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.915
a small but safe
chemical reaction.

01:02:50.317 --> 01:02:52.685
Now follow the instructions
on the board.

01:02:52.719 --> 01:02:54.286
Fire up those burners.

01:02:54.321 --> 01:02:56.322
Stop staring.

01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:02.361
Okay, everyone,
add the sodium hydroxide.

01:03:04.064 --> 01:03:05.364
Ah!

01:03:06.933 --> 01:03:08.100
Wait!

01:03:09.636 --> 01:03:11.070
This beaker's been
tampered with!

01:03:11.104 --> 01:03:15.908
Miles, I prepared all the
solutions myself. They're fine. See?

01:03:28.755 --> 01:03:30.856
So much for Merlin.

01:03:44.838 --> 01:03:46.105
Allie?

01:03:46.139 --> 01:03:47.806
Everybody, duck!

01:03:52.345 --> 01:03:54.079
Is anyone hurt?

01:03:54.948 --> 01:03:57.449
Allie! Miles!
Are you okay?

01:03:58.651 --> 01:04:00.252
Stop, everyone,
what you're doing!

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.388
I want you both to go
and sethe nurse.

01:04:04.824 --> 01:04:06.492
I don't know
what happened here,

01:04:07.127 --> 01:04:10.729
but something is
very, very wrong.

01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:15.300
Are you okay?

01:04:16.703 --> 01:04:18.904
You really should
be more careful.

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.107
Sometimes when you get too
close to something you shouldn't,

01:04:22.142 --> 01:04:23.442
you get burned.

01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:33.552
Okay, this is starting
to get really scary.

01:04:33.586 --> 01:04:35.954
I'm not scared anymore,
Miles. I'm mad.

01:04:35.989 --> 01:04:38.490
I'm gonna find Will after
school and tell him everything.

01:04:38.525 --> 01:04:40.159
He's going to think
you're out of your mind.

01:04:40.193 --> 01:04:43.796
It doesn't matter. He deserves to
know before the eclipse tonight.

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.931
Any chance you're getting
a vision of how it goes?

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.367
Am I doubled over, clutching
my head in excruciating pain?

01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:50.769
No.
Well, there you go, then.

01:05:18.965 --> 01:05:20.866
Hey, Will!
Have a good game, man!

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.101
Yo, Will!

01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:51.964
Will!

01:06:15.154 --> 01:06:17.523
Will! Will!

01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:31.136
Where's Will?

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:32.938
You know
what's going on?

01:06:32.972 --> 01:06:35.807
He's really upset. He kind
of saw me and Jen together.

01:06:36.276 --> 01:06:37.843
Wagner here yet?

01:06:37.877 --> 01:06:39.645
Not yet, Coach.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.247
Well, we're toast.

01:06:42.282 --> 01:06:43.715
Nice pep talk.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.152
Hey! Not one word
out of you, Benwick.

01:06:47.186 --> 01:06:48.320
Not one word.

01:07:23.523 --> 01:07:25.324
Will!

01:07:28.895 --> 01:07:30.696
No! Allie!

01:07:32.932 --> 01:07:36.068
Allie! Are you okay?
Please, you have to be okay!

01:07:36.102 --> 01:07:37.369
Hey.

01:07:39.439 --> 01:07:41.373
Are you hurt?
Can you move everything?

01:07:41.407 --> 01:07:42.941
I'm fine.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.377
What happened?
How did you fall?

01:07:45.411 --> 01:07:47.512
I was pushed.
What?

01:07:47.547 --> 01:07:50.215
Who would push you?
Mordred.

01:07:50.249 --> 01:07:51.416
From the
King Arthur story?

01:07:51.451 --> 01:07:52.784
Yes!

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:54.486
Okay, lie down. I
think you hit your head.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.121
No, Will, I have to
tell you something,

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.223
and you might not
believe me, but it's true.

01:07:58.257 --> 01:07:59.791
I know already.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:01.059
You... You do?
Yeah.

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:02.928
About Lance and Jen.
I saw them.

01:08:02.962 --> 01:08:04.296
No, I know.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.397
And that's part
of the story,

01:08:05.431 --> 01:08:06.665
but there's
so much more to it.

01:08:06.699 --> 01:08:09.267
I don't need to hear the details.
Really. I'm okay. Come on.

01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:12.037
No, Will, listen to me. This
isn't just about Lance and Jen.

01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:15.273
This is about fate. This
is about your destiny.

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:18.010
You aren't just
Will Wagner.

01:08:18.411 --> 01:08:19.478
You're King Arthur.

01:08:20.078 --> 01:08:22.346
And today is the day that
you rise above all the lies

01:08:22.381 --> 01:08:24.416
and the backstabbing
and the self-doubt

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:27.285
and start back on the
path to changing the world.

01:08:27.654 --> 01:08:31.223
You're the one everyone's
been waiting for.

01:08:32.492 --> 01:08:34.393
Allie!

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.232
You're right. Today,
I am like King Arthur.

01:08:40.265 --> 01:08:43.368
I have to be a leader. I have to
face adversity and overcome it.

01:08:43.403 --> 01:08:45.303
What? Yeah, it's a metaphor. I get it.

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:48.305
I'm the team captain, I can't
leave my teammates behind.

01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:50.242
Hey, Miles, can you
give Allie a ride?

01:08:50.276 --> 01:08:51.475
Yeah, sure.

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.615
You're the reason the Knights
are going to be united again.

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:58.283
See you after the game.
I gotta go!

01:08:58.317 --> 01:09:01.252
Will! No! I didn't say
you were like King Arthur,

01:09:01.287 --> 01:09:02.888
I said you are
King Arthur!

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:05.223
And I still have to
warn you about Marco!

01:09:05.258 --> 01:09:07.259
Marco is Mordred!

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:11.630
Now what?

01:09:11.663 --> 01:09:14.499
We have to go to the game and
not let Will out of our sight.

01:09:23.647 --> 01:09:24.781
Ten-hut!

01:09:26.116 --> 01:09:28.651
<i>And another fumble
by the backup quarterback,</i>

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:30.953
<i>and everyone is asking
the same question,</i>

01:09:30.988 --> 01:09:33.488
<i>where is Will Wagner?</i>

01:09:33.524 --> 01:09:36.392
<i>Wait a minute. It looks
like Wagner has showed up.</i>

01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:37.894
Hey, Coach.

01:09:37.928 --> 01:09:39.462
Can I get a time-out?

01:09:39.496 --> 01:09:41.964
Time-out, Knights.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:45.068
Nice of you to
show up, Wagner.

01:09:45.102 --> 01:09:46.569
I shouldn't even
let you on the field.

01:09:46.603 --> 01:09:48.571
I'm sorry, Coach.

01:09:48.604 --> 01:09:50.872
Now give me
a long pass, huh?

01:09:51.875 --> 01:09:53.443
Hey, guys, I'm sorry.

01:09:53.477 --> 01:09:56.412
But I'm here, and I won't
let you down, I promise.

01:09:56.447 --> 01:09:58.981
So come on,
let's get back out there.

01:09:59.016 --> 01:10:00.817
Guys, come on!
Come on, let's go.

01:10:00.851 --> 01:10:02.485
Five, six,
seven, eight.

01:10:02.519 --> 01:10:04.387
Knights! That's right!

01:10:04.421 --> 01:10:05.922
Come on, team, let's fight!

01:10:11.261 --> 01:10:13.696
Well, maybe we were wrong.
Maybe it's not tonight.

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.164
Ready.

01:10:15.766 --> 01:10:16.833
Okay, focus.

01:10:23.006 --> 01:10:26.743
<i>Play has stopped, and here it
comes, folks, right on schedule.</i>

01:10:26.777 --> 01:10:28.144
Or not.

01:10:28.178 --> 01:10:31.581
<i>A lunar eclipse and a meteor
shower at the same time.</i>

01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:33.683
Wow!

01:10:51.702 --> 01:10:54.904
Okay, focus. Let's get on
the board before halftime.

01:10:54.938 --> 01:10:56.806
Deep ball to right.
On one. Ready!

01:10:58.509 --> 01:11:02.445
Yeah! Go, Knights!
Whoo! We're number one!

01:11:03.947 --> 01:11:06.115
Ready! Down!

01:11:07.117 --> 01:11:09.018
Set! Hut!

01:11:11.755 --> 01:11:13.623
<i>Oh,
Wagner gets slammed!</i>

01:11:13.657 --> 01:11:16.993
<i>It almost looks like one of his
linemen missed a block on purpose.</i>

01:11:17.027 --> 01:11:18.361
That's for not showing up.

01:11:18.395 --> 01:11:19.762
Hey, that was
a cheap shot!

01:11:19.797 --> 01:11:22.532
<i>And now the Knights are
turning on each other.</i>

01:11:22.566 --> 01:11:24.667
<i>If you're an Avalon High fan,
this is tough to watch.</i>

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:26.502
Is Mordred making them
act like this?

01:11:26.537 --> 01:11:28.704
No, I don't think so.
I think this is real.

01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:30.840
<i>The Knights need to pull
it together at halftime,</i>

01:11:30.874 --> 01:11:31.841
<i>or their season's over.</i>

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:33.242
Not now, Jen.

01:11:41.084 --> 01:11:42.518
Will.

01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.655
Will, I'm sorry, man.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.292
It's all my fault. I
didn't know how to tell you.

01:11:49.326 --> 01:11:50.460
You made a fool
out of me, Lance.

01:11:50.494 --> 01:11:52.929
I know.
I did it all wrong.

01:11:53.597 --> 01:11:55.932
I don't want to lose you
as my best friend.

01:11:57.067 --> 01:11:59.635
We're like the Knights
of the Round Table.

01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:01.537
We're brothers.

01:12:03.941 --> 01:12:06.676
I'll break up with her.
Don't.

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.010
You don't mean that.

01:12:08.045 --> 01:12:11.714
Truth is, Jen and I haven't
been close for a long time.

01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:14.517
If you guys are happy,
I'm okay with that.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:17.353
So, we cool?

01:12:18.889 --> 01:12:19.856
We're cool.

01:12:22.826 --> 01:12:24.060
Hey, Coach?
Yeah?

01:12:24.094 --> 01:12:25.528
Can I say something?

01:12:26.797 --> 01:12:28.664
Yeah. Go ahead.

01:12:28.699 --> 01:12:31.734
Come on, boys, get it in. Come on!

01:12:32.903 --> 01:12:34.170
Guys,

01:12:34.705 --> 01:12:37.139
I know that for a while
we lost our way as a team,

01:12:37.174 --> 01:12:39.075
but we can get it back.

01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:41.944
All we have to do is remember
what victory felt like,

01:12:41.979 --> 01:12:46.716
remember what triumph meant to
all of us. Remember who we were.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:49.185
'Cause we're that
same team now.

01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:53.856
And if we believe that, nothg
can stop us on our way to glory!

01:12:53.891 --> 01:12:55.725
So, who are we?

01:12:58.328 --> 01:13:02.231
Knights, united, will
never be divided! Knights!

01:13:02.866 --> 01:13:04.033
Come on!
Let's go get 'em!

01:13:10.407 --> 01:13:13.843
Will, please forgive me, I...
It's okay, Jen.

01:13:14.278 --> 01:13:16.679
<i>And with the Dragons
leading 27-nothing,</i>

01:13:16.713 --> 01:13:21.150
<i>here come the Knights, hoping
to mount an improbable comeback.</i>

01:13:22.085 --> 01:13:23.686
Hey, Allie.

01:13:24.521 --> 01:13:26.355
Thanks again for
what you said before.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:27.723
You really helped me
inspire the guys.

01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:29.959
Yeah, okay. Listen.
Oh, man, I forgot my helmet.

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:32.795
I'll see you after
the game. I promise.

01:13:32.829 --> 01:13:34.997
We have a lot
to talk about.

01:13:35.666 --> 01:13:37.633
But we have a lot
to talk about now!

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:42.104
<i>The Dragons
have never lost this season</i>

01:13:42.139 --> 01:13:44.640
<i>when they were ahead
at the half.</i>

01:13:44.675 --> 01:13:45.975
Great.

01:13:46.877 --> 01:13:50.246
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight!

01:13:51.682 --> 01:13:53.015
Hey, Allie,
where's Will?

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:55.284
He just went to
go get his helmet.

01:13:55.919 --> 01:13:58.220
People are asking where he
is. He's got to get out here.

01:13:58.255 --> 01:13:59.989
Everyone thinks
he's losing it.

01:14:00.023 --> 01:14:01.691
It's all my fault.
Pretty much.

01:14:01.725 --> 01:14:04.193
All right, okay. We'll go
find him. We'll go find him!

01:14:04.227 --> 01:14:06.162
Yeah, and meanwhile,
try not to lose the game.

01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:14.270
No sign of Will
in there.

01:14:14.304 --> 01:14:16.739
I need you to concentrate.
Just tell me where he is.

01:14:16.773 --> 01:14:19.008
I told you, I can't just
make it happen on demand.

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.110
Yes, you can, Miles.
I know you can do it.

01:14:21.745 --> 01:14:23.045
It hurts, Allie.

01:14:23.313 --> 01:14:24.814
I know.

01:14:41.698 --> 01:14:43.866
He's in the school theater.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.934
With Marco.

01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:57.713
Marco, where's Will?

01:15:06.723 --> 01:15:07.823
Will!

01:15:07.858 --> 01:15:09.158
Allie!

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.193
What has Marco
done to you?

01:15:11.228 --> 01:15:12.995
Marco?

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:14.563
He was trying
to warn me.

01:15:14.598 --> 01:15:17.466
No, Marco is Mordred.
He's trying to destroy you

01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:19.669
before you figure out
who you really are.

01:15:19.903 --> 01:15:20.970
What?

01:15:21.004 --> 01:15:24.206
What I told you
tonight, it's not a metaphor.

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:27.243
Your destiny is
to change the world.

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:28.778
You are King Arthur.

01:15:29.079 --> 01:15:31.180
You should listen
to Allie, Mr. Wagner.

01:15:34.951 --> 01:15:36.185
Mr. Moore?

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.322
She's absolutely right,
about everything.

01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:44.860
Except for
one small detail.

01:15:45.929 --> 01:15:47.897
Marco...

01:15:49.099 --> 01:15:51.100
Marco's not Mordred.

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:53.235
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:57.373
I am.

01:15:58.442 --> 01:16:01.043
No, it's not possible.
You can't be.

01:16:01.078 --> 01:16:03.145
Ta-da! Surpriue ending.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.194
That was really cool.

01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:21.297
You okay, Will?

01:16:21.331 --> 01:16:23.132
Yeah, I think so.

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:24.767
Wait. This doesn't
make any sense.

01:16:24.801 --> 01:16:27.002
You've been trying
to destroy Will.

01:16:27.037 --> 01:16:28.170
No, I've been
protecting him.

01:16:29.873 --> 01:16:32.875
Look, my father was in
the Order of the Bear,

01:16:32.909 --> 01:16:34.510
and when he died,
I swore to continue on.

01:16:35.345 --> 01:16:37.213
What about all the
terrible things you did?

01:16:37.914 --> 01:16:40.783
I needed to get Mr. Moore,
Mordred, to trust me.

01:16:41.985 --> 01:16:45.788
Allie, you were right. Will
is Arthur and Miles is Merlin.

01:16:45.822 --> 01:16:47.690
I am? Really?

01:16:48.492 --> 01:16:49.492
Cool.

01:16:50.026 --> 01:16:52.795
I want you to know that
treating you guys the way I did

01:16:52.829 --> 01:16:55.798
was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

01:16:55.832 --> 01:17:00.069
But I only did it to keep you
away from Will and out of danger.

01:17:00.103 --> 01:17:01.303
Sorry for all the things
I did to you.

01:17:01.338 --> 01:17:03.706
What are you
talking about?

01:17:05.675 --> 01:17:08.477
Okay, let's just...
Let's get out of here.

01:17:10.147 --> 01:17:11.747
Enough!

01:17:28.565 --> 01:17:30.866
I was just going to try
to destroy you, Arthur,

01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:33.102
by simply crushing
your spirit,

01:17:34.137 --> 01:17:37.273
but I can see now that I'm going
to have to take care of you,

01:17:37.307 --> 01:17:40.142
all of you,
the old-fashioned way.

01:17:41.011 --> 01:17:43.579
Starting with this pest!

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.281
Don't touch her!

01:17:52.155 --> 01:17:53.923
Come on, Allie.

01:18:02.532 --> 01:18:04.099
I guess I won't be
getting that A.

01:18:17.147 --> 01:18:19.181
Stay away from him!

01:18:25.555 --> 01:18:29.992
Do you really think a silly
toy sword is going to stop me?

01:18:34.497 --> 01:18:36.832
What's happening?

01:18:36.867 --> 01:18:39.301
Any sword in the hands of
Arthur becomes Excalibur.

01:18:39.936 --> 01:18:40.836
No.

01:18:41.471 --> 01:18:43.505
It's not possible.

01:18:44.975 --> 01:18:47.676
It was you all along, Allie.
You're King Arthur.

01:18:48.144 --> 01:18:49.511
I...

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.046
I am?

01:18:59.189 --> 01:19:00.389
I am.

01:19:00.957 --> 01:19:02.558
I am King Arthur!

01:19:04.294 --> 01:19:05.895
Allie! Behind you!

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:47.870
Ah!

01:20:14.531 --> 01:20:16.265
Impossible!

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:21.103
I thought maybe you could be
the Lady of the Lake. Maybe.

01:20:21.538 --> 01:20:23.439
But King Arthur?

01:20:23.873 --> 01:20:24.974
King Arthur
can't be a girl!

01:20:26.109 --> 01:20:27.509
And yet, here we are.

01:21:15.191 --> 01:21:16.558
Ah!

01:21:54.464 --> 01:21:56.532
Miles! His staff!

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.301
It's yours!

01:21:59.335 --> 01:22:02.404
To the owner the staff return!
The evil hand that holds it, burn!

01:22:08.411 --> 01:22:09.845
Take it!

01:22:19.589 --> 01:22:22.124
Whoa. Being Merlin rules!

01:22:56.593 --> 01:22:58.560
Don't even think about it.

01:23:10.206 --> 01:23:14.009
Hey! It's after hours. No
one's supposed to be in here.

01:23:14.043 --> 01:23:18.013
Officer! Arrest that girl.
She brought a weapon to school.

01:23:18.047 --> 01:23:20.215
Threatened the life
of a school teacher.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:23.185
Good luck saving the world
from juvie, Your Highness.

01:23:23.219 --> 01:23:26.421
I'm sorry, sir, are you saying
this girl was threatening you with

01:23:26.456 --> 01:23:27.623
a plastic sword?

01:23:27.657 --> 01:23:31.026
No, no, you oaf! With
a real sword. This...

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.795
All right, no. This is a plastic
sword, but it was a real sword.

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:36.165
'Cause she held it and it
became... Whoosh! Excalibur!

01:23:36.199 --> 01:23:38.901
Because she is
King Arthur! And...

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.137
Look, who's
the teacher here?

01:23:42.172 --> 01:23:45.407
We just came in to get some fake
armor for the school mascot, Officer.

01:23:45.441 --> 01:23:48.243
Yeah, I have no idea what
Mr. Moore is talking about.

01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:50.512
And I'm a National Merit
Scholar. I don't kidnap teachers.

01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:51.780
I suck up to them.

01:23:51.814 --> 01:23:53.182
Wagner, shouldn't you
be on the field?

01:23:53.216 --> 01:23:54.583
Yes, sir. I should be.

01:23:55.251 --> 01:23:57.452
Get out there
and get us to State.

01:23:58.388 --> 01:23:59.555
We really need to talk.

01:23:59.589 --> 01:24:03.458
Yeah. Later. Right now,
you have a game to win. Go!

01:24:05.728 --> 01:24:07.629
Okay, okay,
come on.

01:24:07.664 --> 01:24:10.199
No! No!
Okay, buddy.

01:24:10.233 --> 01:24:11.700
The Captain's gonna
love this nutbar.

01:24:13.203 --> 01:24:15.470
No! No, King Arthur cannot
be allowed to live on!

01:24:15.505 --> 01:24:20.342
I have to destroy her! It's
my destiny! It's my destiny!

01:24:22.712 --> 01:24:24.780
We did it.
We stopped Mordred.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.550
Oh, no. I just thought
of something.

01:24:28.585 --> 01:24:29.985
What?

01:24:30.086 --> 01:24:32.788
What if this is just another one
of my crazy King Arthur dreams,

01:24:32.822 --> 01:24:34.690
and in two minutes,
I wake up in my bedroom?

01:24:34.724 --> 01:24:37.492
It's not a dream, Allie.
You're King Arthur.

01:24:37.527 --> 01:24:40.696
And I'm Merlin.
Check this out.

01:24:44.834 --> 01:24:46.301
Cool, huh?

01:24:47.537 --> 01:24:48.537
Let's get out of here.

01:24:48.571 --> 01:24:49.705
Wait.

01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:55.744
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:24:56.379 --> 01:24:59.248
Oh, wow, that's...

01:24:59.282 --> 01:25:02.284
Yeah, the bowing's going to
take some getting used to.

01:25:05.188 --> 01:25:06.588
<i>It's time-out
for the Knights</i>

01:25:06.623 --> 01:25:09.124
<i>as Will Wagner comes back
in as quarterback,</i>

01:25:09.158 --> 01:25:11.293
<i>trailing with just
12 seconds on the clock.</i>

01:25:11.327 --> 01:25:14.296
Ready! Blast!
26, on one.

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:18.133
Fight! That's right! Come
on, team, let's fight!

01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:20.736
Hey there.
Hey!

01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:22.638
Cool pen.

01:25:22.672 --> 01:25:24.172
Thanks!

01:25:24.941 --> 01:25:26.408
Cool hair.

01:25:26.442 --> 01:25:27.809
Thanks.

01:25:29.345 --> 01:25:30.512
Bye.

01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:34.249
Go, Will!

01:25:35.151 --> 01:25:37.252
I don't understand it.
The eclipse came and went,

01:25:37.287 --> 01:25:39.788
and no Arthur, no
Mordred, no great battle.

01:25:39.822 --> 01:25:41.390
I told you not to
get your hopes up.

01:25:41.424 --> 01:25:43.292
But I was so sure
it was Will.

01:25:43.326 --> 01:25:46.261
I know. You even had me
believing it for a second there.

01:25:46.296 --> 01:25:48.563
I guess we'll never
find Arthur.

01:25:49.265 --> 01:25:51.099
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:25:51.134 --> 01:25:54.303
AL Touchdown, touchdown,
we want a touchdown!

01:25:54.337 --> 01:25:55.337
Ready!

01:25:57.206 --> 01:25:58.273
Down!

01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:00.542
Set! Hut!

01:26:04.514 --> 01:26:07.983
<i>Wagner drops back, fakes
left, and he's running it!</i>

01:26:08.017 --> 01:26:10.385
<i>Here comes a tackle,
and oh, my!</i>

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.788
<i>Wagner just hurdled
right over him!</i>

01:26:13.323 --> 01:26:15.424
<i>Look at that speed!</i>

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:17.526
<i>And yes, no one
can touch Wagner now.</i>

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:20.395
<i>He's going to do it!
Touchdown, Knights!</i>

01:26:25.768 --> 01:26:26.902
Yeah!

01:26:28.571 --> 01:26:33.241
<i>They defeated the Dragons,
36-35. They're going to State!</i>

01:26:34.477 --> 01:26:35.377
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:26:36.646 --> 01:26:38.647
We're going to State!

01:26:50.293 --> 01:26:53.028
Knights! Knights!
Knights!

01:26:57.333 --> 01:27:00.068
They're treating him like he's
King Arthur. They have no idea.

01:27:00.103 --> 01:27:02.637
It's okay. I feel like
I'm up there with him.

01:27:14.784 --> 01:27:16.351
Quick, Allie,
lip gloss!

01:27:16.386 --> 01:27:17.419
Why...

01:27:28.464 --> 01:27:29.765
Wait.

01:27:29.799 --> 01:27:31.700
If you're the reincarnation
of King Arthur,

01:27:31.734 --> 01:27:34.302
what does that make me?

01:27:36.672 --> 01:27:38.774
My knight in
shining armor.

01:27:49.852 --> 01:27:52.454
Hey, Marco.
Come eat with us.
