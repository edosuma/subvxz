00:01.068 --> 00:02.947
<i>- Previously on</i> The Passage...

00:03.660 --> 00:04.439
- Amy, I'll find you.

00:04.463 --> 00:05.463
I promise.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.028
- Euthanize her.
- Okay.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.488
<i>But you won't fix
the real problem.</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.312
- Which is?
- The nightmares.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.910
There are a lot
of sick people in the world,

00:16.934 --> 00:18.453
and you could help us
save millions of them.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.519
I want the agent.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.021
Don't look at that. Look at me.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.606
He's gonna come for her.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.292
- Who?
- Fanning.

00:29.572 --> 00:31.383
I guess now is
a good time to talk.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.574
In the last three years,
12 death row inmates

00:33.617 --> 00:35.554
<i>were sent to a government
facility in Colorado</i>

00:35.578 --> 00:37.578
<i>to be used as guinea pigs</i>

00:37.621 --> 00:38.724
for top secret
medical experiments.

00:38.748 --> 00:39.997
I'll look into this.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.584
<i>Stay out of my way,
Agent Wolgast.</i>

01:13.491 --> 01:14.990
<i>It's time, Carter.</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:17.117
<i>You're gonna have
to make a choice.</i>

01:43.896 --> 01:45.729
What are you doing?

01:45.815 --> 01:47.189
Carter had another nightmare.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.857
He has them all the time now.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.192
Is that a part of this?

01:50.319 --> 01:51.860
Is that gonna happen to me?

01:51.946 --> 01:53.445
Are you having nightmares?

01:53.531 --> 01:56.657
No. But all I do all day

01:56.742 --> 01:59.576
is sit around and think
what drug they put in me.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.329
And if I get sick,
what will happen to me?

02:04.667 --> 02:07.084
Is that gonna happen to me?

02:07.169 --> 02:08.270
No, it's not gonna
happen to you, 'cause we're

02:08.294 --> 02:10.175
- gonna get out of here.
- How?

02:10.297 --> 02:12.965
All I know is the hallway
to the elevator to the bathroom.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.028
-And there's men outside
with guns every ten feet...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.321
-...and you said you would
get us out of here.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.823
-And you didn't
get us out of here.
-Hey.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.866
What did I say
we were not gonna do? Huh?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.785
-Panic.
-Panic. And what are
you doing right now?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.120
- Panicking.
- You're panicking.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.685
I'm gonna get us out of here.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.019
What are you gonna do?

02:26.105 --> 02:28.188
I'm gonna broaden our horizons.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.734
...What is it?

02:32.862 --> 02:35.529
I have to see Dr. Lear
right away.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.699
- What for?
- I have all that.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.958
Why do you care so much about
the virals' brain activity?

02:49.128 --> 02:51.795
I think we're witnessing
an evolution.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.755
We need to understand it,

02:53.841 --> 02:56.508
in case we need
to defend ourselves.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.595
From bad dreams? Wow.

02:59.722 --> 03:02.431
You're like my mom who says cell
phones give you brain cancer.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.975
Cell phones do give you
brain cancer.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.728
See? It's just what I suspected.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.416
Their brain activity peaks
overnight.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.190
These...

03:11.275 --> 03:14.443
These nightmares
can't be unrelated.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.528
Maybe it's just static, but...

03:16.614 --> 03:18.572
But what if it is communication?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.200
Who's this?

03:22.286 --> 03:23.827
The intensity of the EM field

03:23.913 --> 03:26.997
is exponentially higher
than all the others.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.375
Fanning.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.921
Sir, I've got Wolgast for you.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.298
Says he wants to talk
to you and Dr. Sykes.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.593
Amy's not sleeping.
She's anxious.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.512
Yeah, that's been going around.
What can we do?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.432
I think, for a start, you can
get her out of that room.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.934
She's ten.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.519
She needs fresh air.
Go outside. Diversion.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.022
D.O.D. has some
security concerns.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.857
Mostly about you.

03:55.361 --> 03:58.237
They can afford
an outdoor security detail.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.530
I'm not Harry Potter.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.288
Okay. Tell me what you need.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.591
I just wanted to say thank you
for what you did.

04:19.677 --> 04:22.094
I wouldn't think
too much about it.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.264
If you really want to thank me,
you can just get out of my head.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.683
We got another problem.

04:27.768 --> 04:31.645
One of your soldiers
is going a little crazy.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.355
What are you talking about?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.983
You're gonna have to take care
of him.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.902
"Take care of him."
What does that mean?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.530
He's gonna blow the whistle
on this whole place.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.343
If what's going on here
gets out,

04:43.367 --> 04:44.552
you're going to be
held responsible,

04:44.576 --> 04:47.494
and then I'm gonna get
euthanized.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.997
I don't think you know what
you're talking about, Shauna.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.707
My people are fine.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.645
Trust any one of them
with my life.

04:53.669 --> 04:58.171
Okay. I guess we'll just wait
and see what happens.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.924
Richards,
we need you in the cell block.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.677
We have a problem
with Sergeant Paulson.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.557
Copy.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.368
Paulson.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.913
What's the problem?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.795
Sir, you know David Winston?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.463
Yeah.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.882
- Met him briefly on the way in.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.467
How have you been, Winston?

06:26.595 --> 06:29.846
He drove long-haul truck
for 20 years.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.808
One day he found a girl,
and he raped her.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.246
He strapped her underneath
his rig and finished his route

06:35.270 --> 06:38.647
from Seattle to Bozeman
with her under there.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.191
Then he went on
a five-year killing spree.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.943
All right, listen to me.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.363
You don't need
to learn their stories.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.802
Yeah, well, he didn't give me
much of a choice, did he?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.906
It's a lot like you
and Shauna Babcock.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.843
<i>You know what he says to me?</i>

07:09.555 --> 07:11.515
- He tells me he loves me.
- Randy,

07:11.557 --> 07:14.057
this is what,
our third tour now?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.684
I brought you along

07:15.769 --> 07:17.664
- because I trust you.
- These things can do

07:17.688 --> 07:19.541
whatever they want,
and no one can stop 'em.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.793
I mean, you can, but Babcock
won't let you, you know?

07:21.817 --> 07:23.503
I want you to report
to the medic right now.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.860
You need a full psych eval.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.405
Babcock is playing you.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.698
Listen to me.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.117
<i>You need to wake up.</i>

07:32.202 --> 07:35.370
<i>We are sworn to protect
the lives in this facility</i>

07:35.414 --> 07:38.823
<i>until these lab rats give us
the cure that we need.</i>

07:38.876 --> 07:40.959
<i>We've just been here too long.</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:48.216
How do you know we're not
the lab rats?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.983
You know, I can't believe
they let you do this to me.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.610
What are you talking about?

08:06.695 --> 08:08.923
My dad and I built a treehouse
when I was your age.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.697
Just like this.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.782
You know, minus the guards.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.951
It was awesome.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.495
So is basketball.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.996
I'd murder you at basketball.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.915
Go ahead, make it yours.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.083
Add any changes.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.002
Okay, one big ground rule here.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.773
We handle all
the construction tools,

08:25.797 --> 08:29.508
Hammer.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.135
Yay.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.850
All right,
let's see what you got.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.940
All right,
this is a great start.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.943
Lot of imagination here.
I like it.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.405
We'll start on the ladder.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.991
Don't wander outside
the perimeter,

08:55.077 --> 08:56.618
or we'll have to shoot you.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.119
Yup. Got it.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.664
See, Amy? Fun.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.294
Amy.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.589
What's wrong with this picture?

09:09.675 --> 09:11.424
Come on up.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.843
We built this for you.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.303
Come on.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.402
You're afraid of heights.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.529
- No.
- I'm not gonna make fun of you.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.717
- You already are.
- No. What about when you climbed

09:34.741 --> 09:36.594
down that ladder
the first day we met?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.827
I was more scared of you
than heights.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.112
Focus on where you're going.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.997
Come on. Take that step.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.331
There you go. Don't look down.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.166
Look up. Look at me.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.335
Look into these
beautiful hazel eyes.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.422
Gross.
- Come on, you're doing great.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.090
Come on.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.301
I got you.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.219
All right.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.887
There you go.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.098
You made it up. All right.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.559
...Good.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.852
Tell me what you see.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.731
Same things I see every day.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.232
Not exactly.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.235
Now we have a bird's-eye view
of Project Noah

10:12.362 --> 10:15.030
and what's on the other side
of that security wall.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.489
Wow.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.866
That's genius.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.909
Don't act so surprised.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.287
I got skills.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.875
All right, Anthony.
This all looks good.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.793
The dreams are worse.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.381
It's happening every time
I close my eyes.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.718
It's the same guy. Fanning.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.054
Who is he?

10:39.097 --> 10:41.139
Come on, tell me, man.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.894
Tim Fanning...

10:46.021 --> 10:48.480
was the most brilliant man
I ever knew.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.128
Also one of
the most manipulative.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.152
What happened to him?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.655
I can't tell you that.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.492
Okay, well, he's coming for me.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.578
He says I have to make a choice.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.121
What kind of choice?

11:05.207 --> 11:07.290
I don't know, Dr. Lear.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.585
I always wake up before we get
to the Q and A part.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.206
You know, Anthony,
you have a very good chance

11:15.258 --> 11:18.093
of coming through this trial
without any side effects.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.429
You're different.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.931
How?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.726
You're young. You're strong.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.581
And you're
the first test subject

11:28.605 --> 11:30.897
who hasn't tried to convince me
of your innocence.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.442
You know I read
your case file, right?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.070
So you know everything about me?

11:37.114 --> 11:38.508
I know your
court-appointed lawyer

11:38.532 --> 11:39.823
fell asleep during the trial.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.075
Yeah, well,
you get what you pay for.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.013
I also know Project Innocence
offered to take on your case,

11:44.037 --> 11:44.994
and you turned them down.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.246
What are we doing here?

11:46.331 --> 11:48.164
See...

11:49.793 --> 11:53.795
I don't know what happened
to Rachel Wilson,

11:53.922 --> 11:58.133
but I think her death
is clearly a burden on you.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.139
Hey.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.142
I have some great news.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.768
What?

12:08.895 --> 12:11.479
They've got the tater tots back
in the cafeteria.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.274
Oh, did you call in
a favor to get that?

12:14.317 --> 12:17.026
Oh, yeah. Meet me upstairs
when your shift's over.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.154
I'll have ketchup.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.031
Sure.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.576
As long as we don't have
to talk about work.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.828
Well, then...

12:26.913 --> 12:28.955
I'll have to ask you
something now.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.460
I've been, uh, getting questions
about the Babcock thing.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.713
Why did you change your mind
about the execution?

12:38.633 --> 12:40.967
Last minute,
I called the D.O.D.,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.595
let them know that
we were using deadly force.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.096
They said absolutely not.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.056
Told me to stand down.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.870
Why would they overrule
your decision?

12:48.894 --> 12:51.269
She killed someone.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.731
Well, we've got
$36 million invested per viral.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.817
I guess nobody wants
to set that much cash on fire.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.696
Oh. Okay.

13:37.776 --> 13:38.858
Hi.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.026
Welcome.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.653
Uh, you here for the open house?

13:42.948 --> 13:46.199
I was just driving by
and had to pop in.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.368
Okay.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.702
Rachel Wilson,

13:49.830 --> 13:51.621
RW & A Realty.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.039
Anthony Carter.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.499
And thanks for coming,

13:54.626 --> 13:56.646
but I'm not looking
for any help on this.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.773
No, you're not looking
to pay a commission.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.380
Am I right?

14:01.967 --> 14:04.843
I try to only pay
for things I can't do myself.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.929
Give me the confidence
of a first-time home flipper.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.640
Look around.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.434
Everything in here
is top-of-the-line.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.998
-Yeah, I mean,
you have a great eye.
-Yeah.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.607
Expensive taste, but...
you've been on the market

14:19.693 --> 14:22.610
30% longer than average,
with no bites.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.031
Let me help you.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.950
How?

14:29.035 --> 14:32.120
How about a freebie?

14:33.164 --> 14:34.998
Okay.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.292
Kitchen. Solid layout.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.794
Sink and the stove
are an A-plus.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.566
- Appreciate it.
- So, wait, this-this can't be

14:41.590 --> 14:43.298
the only fridge in here.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.800
It's a totally new,
energy-efficient technology...

14:45.844 --> 14:48.261
Yeah, but it doesn't have
any room for groceries, so...

14:48.388 --> 14:49.679
maybe swap it out.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.640
...Yeah.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.267
That's such a good stove.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.603
Ugh! What is this?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.522
- That is an apple.
- Mm-mm, no.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.025
It's a pop of color.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.568
This is good.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.154
Let's see where we need
more of this.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.661
Wh-What?

15:14.998 --> 15:16.998
Anthony,
the bed's in the corner.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.751
What's wrong...?

15:19.836 --> 15:21.796
Have you never lived
with a woman?

15:24.633 --> 15:26.716
- Ever?
- I have an active dating life.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.238
-Uh-huh.
-I-I just enjoy
having space to myself.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.929
Okay, now I get it.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.972
That's the problem.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.225
This house is a pure expression
of what's in your heart.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.331
I mean, it's the perfect home
for a young couple.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.875
You know, two people in love,
ready to start a life together.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.359
But you do these little things
to... to sabotage it,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.297
and I don't even think
you're doing them on purpose.

15:46.321 --> 15:50.740
I swear I've never said this
in a business context, but...

15:50.784 --> 15:53.660
open up your heart, Anthony.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.662
Let love in.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.792
Could have just said,
"Move the bed."

16:04.255 --> 16:05.880
God.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.430
Do you want me to ask you out?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.851
Yeah, I guess I do.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.647
<i>Good job, buddy.</i>

16:22.732 --> 16:24.148
She's a catch.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.357
Watch your fingers.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.861
How you feeling?
Anything different?

17:09.988 --> 17:12.030
Hot? Cold? How you sleeping?

17:13.074 --> 17:15.366
I feel great.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.535
I'm worried
about Carter, though.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.473
- He sounded sick.
- I'm sure he's fine,

17:19.497 --> 17:21.289
but I'll ask Dr. Lear, okay?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.375
Looks like we're done here.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.963
There you go.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.173
Thanks.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.303
Hey.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.265
May I use your binoculars?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.121
Come on,
I've never been to Colorado.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.396
I don't know
if I'll ever see nature again.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.739
Our secret.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.367
Thank you.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.380
You're scaring me.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.508
Just doing what you do, Agent.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.885
You can call me Brad.
That's my name.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.806
Your name is The Agent.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.188
- So, what do I look at?
- South-southeast.

18:27.232 --> 18:30.525
Tell me everything you see
over the border wall.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.738
<i>Shauna Babcock,</i>

18:35.865 --> 18:37.676
20 years old,
got the death penalty

18:37.700 --> 18:40.326
for the murder of her own mother
and stepfather.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.807
Her official date of execution
passed five months ago,

18:42.831 --> 18:44.517
but the execution
never happened.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.957
It was two men.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.084
They said they were FBI.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.086
They spoke to the warden.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.588
Put Babcock
in the back of their car,

18:52.674 --> 18:55.299
and that was it, she was gone.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.593
Classified
records obtained by WWN

18:57.679 --> 18:59.720
detail close to a dozen victims,

18:59.806 --> 19:01.283
death row inmates
just like Babcock,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.244
with no one to speak up
for them...

19:03.268 --> 19:04.600
until now.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.853
I'm going to start watching

19:06.896 --> 19:08.479
cable news again, just for you.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.356
Did you make

19:10.441 --> 19:11.941
the connection to Telluride?

19:12.026 --> 19:13.306
Everything you said checked out.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.735
It's all in there.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.823
News vans could be there
tomorrow.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.365
Hey, so I've gone after

19:19.450 --> 19:22.660
some powerful people before,
and it can get pretty scary.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.495
If you need security...

19:24.581 --> 19:25.913
She brought me along.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.293
Well, we go to air tomorrow
at 5:00 p.m., so...

19:30.378 --> 19:32.753
until then, just lay low.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.964
<i>I'm calling to follow up</i>

19:35.091 --> 19:38.801
on the conversation you had
with Clark Richards.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.263
Yeah. He-he said that you spoke
about our decision

19:42.390 --> 19:44.849
to have Shauna Babcock put down.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.688
He didn't?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.732
Are you sure?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.028
Okay, thank you.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.157
This E.M. surge from Fanning
is 400% higher

20:01.242 --> 20:03.326
than anything we saw yesterday.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.912
What the hell's going on?

20:19.594 --> 20:21.969
We got to get him downstairs.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.377
Okay, we got to move him now!
Move, move! Help me!

20:30.021 --> 20:31.437
Stupid trees.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.689
Stupid birds.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.608
Mountains.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.987
Hey.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.906
There's a guy on the roof.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.241
What's he look like?

20:46.537 --> 20:48.996
He has a big gun, and he's...

20:50.375 --> 20:52.667
- Get down!
- Take cover!

20:59.259 --> 21:01.300
Body temperature's 102.6
and rising.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.571
How long has he been like this?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.428
Is it too late?
- No.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.972
No, I'm not gonna lose you.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.810
- Did you pull up his blood?
- Got it right here.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.814
This is a snapshot
of Carter's viral genome,

21:14.899 --> 21:19.485
from a few days ago,
and this is a sample from today.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.737
Look. Every time
we attenuate the formula,

21:21.864 --> 21:23.592
- it mutates back.
- Okay, what if we

21:23.616 --> 21:27.410
synthesize a new injection,
excise the bad nucleotides?

21:27.495 --> 21:29.870
How long will it take?
- Not long. We just need

21:29.914 --> 21:32.195
to pull the sample
and run the knock-out sequence.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.755
What is that?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.883
Those are gunshots.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.365
The shooter's got to be
on the northwest rooftop.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.764
- Spread out, find your shot.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.558
We've got an active shooter!

21:51.853 --> 21:53.352
...Down, down, down,

21:53.438 --> 21:54.645
down, down, down.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.578
Richards, this is Paulson.
I'm the man on the roof.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.251
Damn it, Paulson. How the hell
you expect this to end?

22:17.337 --> 22:20.257
-With me on a helicopter
out of here.
-Listen to me.

22:20.298 --> 22:23.257
If you end this now,
I will pull every string I have

22:23.343 --> 22:25.968
to get the D.O.D.
to go easy on you,

22:26.054 --> 22:28.304
but if you kill anyone,
all bets are off.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.783
I don't want anyone to die,
Richards,

22:29.807 --> 22:31.047
but you wouldn't listen to me.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.601
I don't know what else to do.

22:33.728 --> 22:37.063
I got a clear shot
on the electric substation.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.292
The backups are in there, too.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.044
I can take out power
to this entire compound.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.651
I need a helicopter. Find it.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.658
Okay, listen to me.
We're gonna make a run for it.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.253
You see those men over there?

23:01.339 --> 23:03.275
- That's our finish line.
- It's too far.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.069
No, it won't be
once we start running.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.052
Stay behind me, you got it?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.808
Three... two...

23:13.893 --> 23:14.893
one...

23:14.977 --> 23:16.143
Go!

23:19.941 --> 23:21.899
Stay low. Amy. Amy!

23:36.374 --> 23:37.706
Everyone make it in one piece?

23:37.792 --> 23:40.626
Yeah. We're good.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.962
Thanks.

23:45.133 --> 23:48.426
Fever's 103.1.
His fever's getting worse.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.136
We're nearly there.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.025
What happened?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.027
We lost power.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.113
Sykes, it's Richards.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.277
Paulson took out
the electrical substation.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.325
Saying he wants a helicopter.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.619
There's a bad situation
going on with Carter.

24:15.705 --> 24:18.789
We need power back now,
but I can't send a repair team

24:18.875 --> 24:21.667
with Paulson on that rooftop.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.794
All right, give me a minute.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.671
Let me go talk to him.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.715
I can get a cease-fire.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.262
I'm gonna take Wolgast
to the roof with me.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.931
Paulson's not talking to me, but
he might get through to him.

24:36.058 --> 24:39.268
He was a negotiation specialist
in our unit.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.353
Okay, get an escort for Amy.

24:41.439 --> 24:44.231
Send her to me,
and I'll keep her safe.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.066
On it.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.319
Sykes will look after you.

24:51.532 --> 24:52.865
More ice.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.242
We need to bring his fever down.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.961
- Oh, Rachel.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.840
I'm sorry, do zombies live here?

25:09.967 --> 25:12.843
No one lives here.
That's the point, smart-ass.

25:12.929 --> 25:13.969
Yeah.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.679
Come on.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.559
Hey, what are we doing here?

25:22.396 --> 25:26.524
Okay, so I know we said no gifts
for our three months,

25:26.609 --> 25:29.860
but... I saw this place for us.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.779
- And it's perfect.

25:31.864 --> 25:35.074
I mean, look at it.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.992
Babe, I don't get it.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.453
I mean, what's this place
have to do with us?

25:39.497 --> 25:43.415
This place is 3,800 square feet,
and I could get it for nothing.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.167
We could flip it,

25:45.294 --> 25:49.213
take the money
and start our life together.

25:50.466 --> 25:53.425
I just finished selling
my first house,

25:53.511 --> 25:56.929
and this-this is a big step up
from a three-bedroom ranch.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.390
I-I'm just a one-man operation.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.559
What about me?

26:01.644 --> 26:03.330
-Babe.
-I'm sorry, did you
sell that place

26:03.354 --> 26:05.123
- all by yourself?
- No. No.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.022
You and I are a team,

26:07.108 --> 26:09.044
but I don't have a crew
or the right suppliers...

26:09.068 --> 26:10.568
Why are you always so negative?

26:10.695 --> 26:13.654
- Why can't you trust me?
- Whoa.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.948
I have so much faith in you,
Anthony.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.325
I believe in you,
but you never trust that.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.163
Babe, th-this is just about
the house.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.418
Well, I already made the deal.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.211
I closed escrow yesterday.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.046
I'm sorry.

26:31.132 --> 26:34.633
I thought this would be
a good opportunity for us.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.094
But it's not your problem.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.846
Nothing's in your name.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.472
I will figure it out.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.016
Okay.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.060
Okay.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.187
I'll-I'll make a few calls,

26:47.273 --> 26:50.065
and I'll pull a crew together.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.358
Yes!

26:51.444 --> 26:54.486
Yes!

26:54.572 --> 26:56.530
We can do this.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.825
Hey, you can do this.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.827
You are crazy, you know that?

27:02.872 --> 27:05.581
- Crazy.
- Yeah, well...

27:05.666 --> 27:07.666
maybe you need a little crazy.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.397
- Maybe I do.
- Yeah.

27:10.421 --> 27:11.795
Mm-hmm.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.107
My God, Anthony.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.734
You're burning up.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.321
All right, he's too hot.
He's gonna seize.

27:37.448 --> 27:38.656
I need some more ice.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.119
I-I don't know what's happening.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.830
You still haven't
figured it out yet?

27:50.461 --> 27:52.795
<i>His temperature's 106.</i>

27:52.922 --> 27:55.381
We're out of time.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.235
Without power,
we're gonna lose him.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.279
How did this get out of hand
so quickly?

27:59.303 --> 28:02.346
It's Fanning. He's drawing
energy from the other virals.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.765
I don't know, maybe there's some
snowball effect

28:04.892 --> 28:06.975
that's making
the virus mutate faster.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.602
That's crazy.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.062
Well, that's where we are.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.215
I can hear everything you say.
Don't try anything stupid.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.092
- Why do you think he snapped?
- This place is

28:20.116 --> 28:22.344
a pressure cooker, and he's
been here since day one.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.346
You can't give me anything else?
Specifics? It'll help.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.994
Here's all you need to know:

28:26.038 --> 28:28.038
We started this place
to save lives,

28:28.082 --> 28:30.541
and I don't need the body count
getting any higher.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.543
Just get through to him.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.341
...Let me see your hands!

28:39.427 --> 28:41.218
- Let me see your hands!
- Wait. Don't shoot.

28:41.303 --> 28:44.012
I'm alone. Don't shoot.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.575
- Don't shoot.
- Step out from the door.

28:45.599 --> 28:46.868
All right, I'm working on
your helicopter,

28:46.892 --> 28:48.559
but there's a problem.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.248
Place your hands
behind your head.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.896
Walk backwards to me.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.318
You're Paulson, right?
My name is Wolgast.

29:01.532 --> 29:03.115
Stop.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.658
I'm unarmed.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.035
We have a medical emergency
downstairs.

29:07.163 --> 29:10.405
We need the power restored now.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.708
That's on you.
You could have a chopper here

29:12.793 --> 29:14.479
in minutes
if you made the right call.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.690
We both know the people
that you're dealing with.

29:16.714 --> 29:19.381
They'll blow this entire rooftop
with you and me on it.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.091
I planned for that.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.385
What did you do?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.432
Slowly.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.353
I used my access to 4B,

29:33.439 --> 29:35.981
and I smuggled a vial of
Fanning's blood out of here.

29:36.025 --> 29:39.651
And you're never gonna
track it down without my help.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.114
...Here we go.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.908
We have breaking news.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.787
A tragedy involving one of
our own investigative reporters:

29:49.872 --> 29:53.207
Sierra Thompson died earlier
today in a single-car accident.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.626
- We need to go.
- We have Kurt Wisner

29:55.711 --> 29:57.272
- on the scene.
- They killed her.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.588
- We need to go now, Lila.

29:59.673 --> 30:02.424
Uh, thanks, Brian.
What I have so far...

30:02.551 --> 30:05.594
Vitals are still stable,
but he seems hot.

30:09.183 --> 30:12.893
My God. Babe, babe, babe,
babe, babe, babe.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.813
What happened? Are you okay?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.981
Here. S-Sit down. Sit down.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.863
Did someone hit you?

30:24.949 --> 30:26.907
I need a minute.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.284
And a drink.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.119
Okay, okay.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.796
Here you go.

30:45.261 --> 30:47.261
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

30:47.388 --> 30:49.471
...Come on.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.683
You're okay.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.858
I'm married.

31:02.695 --> 31:06.321
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, you don't...

31:06.365 --> 31:09.491
- you don't understand.
- No, I didn't understand before.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.579
But I understand now.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.293
I'm such an idiot.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.295
Listen, I know...

31:21.380 --> 31:25.883
I know it's asking a lot and I
don't deserve anything from you,

31:25.926 --> 31:28.427
but can you please
let me explain?

31:28.512 --> 31:31.305
No. I-I never cared
that you act crazy,

31:31.432 --> 31:33.765
but now y-you're a liar.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.581
- I'm-I'm gonna get out of here.
- Anthony, Anthony, please.

31:37.605 --> 31:39.040
- Please, please, Anthony.
- I don't want to look

31:39.064 --> 31:40.917
- at you right now.
- Please... please don't.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.983
Please, please don't. Please.

31:43.068 --> 31:47.446
Can you please
just listen to me, okay?

31:47.531 --> 31:50.532
Please. I know, I know.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.534
I know. I'm sorry.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.165
Don't worry.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.125
You'll see him soon.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.002
He's nice, right?

32:02.129 --> 32:04.129
I'm not so bad, either.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.009
Who are you?

32:09.094 --> 32:11.511
You know me.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.221
Come on, try.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.265
Relax your brain.

32:15.309 --> 32:17.389
Pretend like
we've been friends forever.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.354
There it is.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.315
Right? My name. Tell me.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.025
Shauna Babcock.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.652
I know you, too.

32:26.737 --> 32:29.363
You're Amy from Memphis,
whose mama overdosed.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.657
I'm sorry about that.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.553
I know it's hard
to lose a parent.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.869
Where are you right now?

32:35.996 --> 32:37.663
Really?

32:37.748 --> 32:39.623
Smart girl.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.627
I'm down in the basement
locked up.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.800
Show me the real you.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.136
Are you sure?

32:53.263 --> 32:55.263
- It's a little scary.
- Yeah.

32:55.349 --> 32:56.974
- I am.
- Okay.

32:57.059 --> 32:58.642
I'll show you.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.847
I'm gonna change right back,
though, okay?

33:13.367 --> 33:14.950
I'm nothing like you.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.535
But you are.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.616
You're changing already.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.997
You can feel that, right?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.874
I know you're scared,

33:22.960 --> 33:24.334
but after you change,

33:24.420 --> 33:26.628
you're not gonna need anybody
to protect you.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.525
You're finally gonna have
a family.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.048
We're gonna look out for you.

33:30.134 --> 33:31.883
All you have to do is give in.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.802
Fighting only makes it harder.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.304
Ask that poor guy on the roof
with the gun.

33:36.432 --> 33:38.640
Or ask Carter.

33:38.767 --> 33:42.060
I don't want anything
to do with you.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.030
Why? You don't have anybody.

33:53.157 --> 33:54.698
I have the agent.

33:54.825 --> 33:57.145
Trust me, he's gonna have
a hard time with all this.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.579
Just promise me one thing.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.165
Don't let anybody tell you
what to think.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.958
Listen to you.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.710
You know what's best.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.962
I want you to go now.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.465
I get it.

34:11.592 --> 34:14.926
But if you want to talk,
I'm around.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.891
I'm gonna get someone
to check the blood locker

34:21.935 --> 34:23.746
to see if Paulson's bluffing,
but if he's not,

34:23.771 --> 34:26.188
you need to get
the location of that vial.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.440
Do whatever it takes.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.485
You know if that blood gets out,
it's a disaster.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.196
It's the only way I can
get people to listen to me.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.664
You're on the wrong side
of this.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.958
Not anymore. I want
this place shut down, too.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.460
Great.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.608
Did we finally get
to the "gain his trust" chapter

34:51.632 --> 34:53.632
of the hostage negotiation
handbook?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.095
I've been on 4B.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.638
I've seen what

34:59.765 --> 35:01.409
they've turned
those people into.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.351
And I know about the dreams.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.436
I know they're real.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.446
Who'd you get in your head?

35:16.532 --> 35:17.697
Fanning.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.950
No one knew what
this was gonna be.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.274
And they can't even admit
what it is they've done.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.289
We don't have much more time.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.501
Let me help you.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.044
We can work together.

35:37.386 --> 35:39.845
Two's not enough to stop them.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.429
What are you talking about?

35:41.515 --> 35:44.474
Winston told me everything.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.519
The virals
aren't gonna break out.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.272
We're gonna let 'em out.

35:50.399 --> 35:51.773
They can't control us.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.059
- Not to do something like that.
- Ask Richards.

35:55.028 --> 35:57.112
Ask him about Babcock.

35:57.197 --> 36:00.240
He saved her life,
and you want to know why?

36:00.284 --> 36:02.492
It's because Fanning
needs all of them alive,

36:02.578 --> 36:04.161
and when he gets one more,

36:04.246 --> 36:05.328
that's when...

36:05.455 --> 36:06.455
No!

36:11.837 --> 36:13.523
I told you
I could talk him down.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.567
Target down is confirmed.
Target down is confirmed.

36:15.591 --> 36:17.465
I need a repair crew ASAP.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.010
I gave you
as much time as you deserve.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.469
What about Fanning's blood?

36:21.555 --> 36:24.347
All the vials
are accounted for on 4B.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.369
You pulled that trigger
to shut him up.

36:26.393 --> 36:29.352
He was a raving lunatic, and he
put my men in the line of fire.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.062
Was he right about Babcock?

36:31.190 --> 36:32.856
And who's the "one more"?

36:32.941 --> 36:34.878
- What's going on?
- When were you down on 4B?

36:34.902 --> 36:36.546
What are you ta...?
That was a bluff.

36:36.570 --> 36:38.423
I said that
to get him to trust me.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.905
Oh, it sure is funny timing,

36:40.032 --> 36:42.324
considering the security
incident we just had.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.345
We don't have time
to be at each other's throats.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.660
There's trouble coming.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.287
Okay. If trouble comes,

36:47.372 --> 36:49.247
- I'll handle it.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.892
Jonas.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.026
It's Fanning, isn't it?

37:20.489 --> 37:23.114
You need to push him out.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.325
- I'm gonna help you through.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.202
Thank God. All right.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.556
Let's prep him
for the antiviral.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.829
Come on, let's move.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.706
<i>I thought I could get out</i>

37:31.750 --> 37:33.478
of the marriage
without you ever knowing.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.961
- It's him.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.338
- Give me that.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.465
- Give it to me.
- I...

37:51.436 --> 37:54.312
She'll call you
when she has something to say.

37:55.357 --> 37:58.024
So, what happens now?

37:58.110 --> 38:02.070
I love you, Rachel, but...

38:02.197 --> 38:05.156
I need time to think.

38:33.437 --> 38:36.229
Temperature's spiking.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.667
Negative. Current one's already
giving an accurate reading.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.232
- Set it up again.
- No progress.

38:39.359 --> 38:40.483
Come on, Carter.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.322
Negative effect.

38:56.126 --> 38:57.667
Rachel?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.385
Rachel.

39:33.747 --> 39:35.497
Rachel. Rachel.

39:35.582 --> 39:38.666
Baby, breathe.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.293
Please.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.962
Rachel, please breathe.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.465
Come on, babe.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.550
Baby, breathe.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.804
Hmm.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.973
I can see how this was tough
to explain.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.768
That's the problem
with being the sidepiece.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.105
When push comes to shove,
you just don't matter.

40:00.232 --> 40:03.650
Now you got the rich,
angry husband after you.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.630
He definitely hates her
more than he hates you,

40:05.654 --> 40:07.862
but either way,
he's telling the cops

40:07.989 --> 40:09.592
that you're the one
that hit her.

40:09.616 --> 40:10.616
What's happening?

40:10.700 --> 40:12.784
You're dying, Carter.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.545
My God.
What's Fanning doing to him?

40:23.588 --> 40:25.964
- Guys, we need more ice.
- More. Get it in here.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.884
You've been playing this scene
on a loop

40:29.970 --> 40:32.262
<i>in your head
for the past two years,</i>

40:32.389 --> 40:33.680
<i>and every single time,</i>

40:33.765 --> 40:34.765
she ends up dead.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.307
<i>And every single time,</i>

40:36.393 --> 40:38.101
<i>you get framed for her murder.</i>

40:38.228 --> 40:40.228
So why'd you go down
without a fight?

40:41.898 --> 40:43.273
I...

40:44.651 --> 40:46.609
I could've helped her.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.363
I could've...

40:50.490 --> 40:53.825
could've just said
I forgave her.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.785
Oh, my God.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.807
Can I reframe this for you,
please?

40:57.831 --> 41:00.206
<i>She was a mentally ill,
selfish drug addict.</i>

41:00.250 --> 41:02.000
<i>No, you don't know
a thing about her.</i>

41:02.127 --> 41:03.354
<i>Except I do,
because I've been watching</i>

41:03.378 --> 41:06.546
<i>the movie with you
ever since you got here.</i>

41:13.555 --> 41:15.346
I don't want to die.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.223
So don't.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.058
You don't have to.

41:19.186 --> 41:21.603
Choose me.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.430
...The next step
is right in front of you.

41:24.524 --> 41:28.860
You just have to take it
and be part of my family.

41:31.031 --> 41:33.198
<i>You want to feel connection.</i>

41:33.325 --> 41:34.574
<i>It's human.</i>

41:34.659 --> 41:36.659
<i>But in the end,
it just hurts you.</i>

41:36.703 --> 41:38.953
<i>You got blamed
for Rachel Wilson's death</i>

41:39.039 --> 41:42.207
<i>because you were poor
and you were black.</i>

41:42.292 --> 41:43.917
<i>That's where love got you.</i>

41:44.002 --> 41:46.252
Why does that
not make you angry?

41:46.338 --> 41:49.464
<i>I'm offering you a new life.</i>

41:49.508 --> 41:50.882
<i>One without pain.</i>

41:50.967 --> 41:53.092
<i>One without suffering.</i>

41:53.136 --> 41:54.989
<i>Power is what
you've been missing.</i>

41:55.013 --> 41:59.224
<i>Love without power is misery.</i>

42:01.186 --> 42:03.436
Clark.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.527
<i>Choose, Carter. Do it. Now.</i>

42:10.612 --> 42:12.111
<i>You can curl up and die,</i>

42:12.197 --> 42:13.841
<i>or you can be at the top
of the food chain.</i>

42:13.865 --> 42:16.324
<i>You can cash in,
or you can run the table.</i>

42:16.409 --> 42:18.826
<i>You can be the victim,
or you can be the perpetrator.</i>

42:18.954 --> 42:20.495
<i>-Either way...</i>

42:20.580 --> 42:22.308
<i>your heart
is going to stop beating</i>

42:22.332 --> 42:24.457
<i>in eight seconds.</i>

42:24.584 --> 42:27.168
<i>So, what's it gonna be?</i>

42:35.929 --> 42:37.011
Jonas.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.231
Jonas!

43:01.997 --> 43:04.330
Lock it down!
Everybody out now!

43:06.459 --> 43:08.084
Jonas.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.129
Your mask.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.131
- What?
- Whose blood is that?
