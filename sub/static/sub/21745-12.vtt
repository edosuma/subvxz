WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:08.176
ANNOUNCER: The Assassination
of Gianni Versace.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.744
Premieres Wednesday,
January 17 on FX.

00:13.081 --> 00:16.750
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.856
*

00:39.873 --> 00:41.875
Jimmy?

00:52.120 --> 00:54.122
Jimmy?

01:00.628 --> 01:02.630
(sobbing)

01:12.640 --> 01:14.642
*

01:34.428 --> 01:37.064
Hello, you.

01:37.097 --> 01:37.998
Where are you going?

01:38.031 --> 01:39.833
I thought you were gone.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.669
-I was.
-I thought you left.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.571
I did. To get us...

01:43.604 --> 01:44.838
Oh.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.640
No, no, no, no, no. I just...

01:46.674 --> 01:47.941
I just went to get provisions.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.077
But I could see
how you'd think, you know,

01:50.110 --> 01:51.612
given history...

01:51.645 --> 01:53.781
But no, silly, I'm here.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.783
So, I was thinking maybe later

01:55.816 --> 01:57.117
we could go for a ride

01:57.151 --> 01:59.587
and revisit
some of our favorite activities.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.021
Get Chinese food,
hit the movies.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.491
Secret pinball arcade.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.426
Maybe some micheladas

02:05.459 --> 02:07.495
and "you dropped something"
in the park.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.670
Were you crying?

02:16.704 --> 02:18.138
-I want to go.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.608
What?
I-I didn't leave this time.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.109
Gretchen, I didn't leave.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.478
Just got pain au chocolat.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.714
Exactly.
You can't even get breakfast

02:26.747 --> 02:28.782
without me thinking
that you've bailed again.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.118
I have spent my entire life

02:31.151 --> 02:34.822
pretending that all this
is a force field

02:34.855 --> 02:36.957
that stops things
from penetrating.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.627
But no one chooses me, Jimmy!

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
Not in the end.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.131
In the end,
no one ever fights for me.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.467
So, because I went
to get croissants

02:46.500 --> 02:48.469
filled with goddamn chocolate
for you

02:48.502 --> 02:50.137
and was gonna lay in bed
with you,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.072
eating chocolate for breakfast

02:52.105 --> 02:53.741
because I wanted you to wake up

02:53.774 --> 02:56.143
to something special
and delicious,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.547
and still you lay this shit
at my feet?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.081
Make sure you want to go here.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.884
I have apologized!

03:03.917 --> 03:05.919
I've waited.

03:05.953 --> 03:09.657
I've sat idly by
while you did whatever

03:09.690 --> 03:12.025
because you were wronged by me.
True.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.995
But this goddamn vacillation,
Gretchen.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.830
Enough is enough.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.766
I didn't do anything this time.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.768
Yep. You're right.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.503
You win.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.005
See, Jimmy?
You don't really need me.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.775
Why don't you go do
all that fun stuff without me.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.545
Deep down, I think you like
being alone more, anyway.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.247
Yep, you're right. Maybe I do.

03:49.129 --> 03:52.266
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:52.300 --> 03:55.536
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:55.569 --> 03:56.904
* Gonna leave you anyway.

04:05.112 --> 04:08.048
-DUTCH: Oh, yeah, yeah.
-MAX: Oh, I get it.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.552
-Really? -I mean,
if those speakers cost 20 Gs,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.554
they better look so hot,
I want to stick my dick in 'em.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.722
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

04:14.755 --> 04:16.557
But, like, respectfully.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.559
So, you can
put your dick in them.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.960
See, I knew those guys
at Guitar Center

04:19.993 --> 04:21.228
had no right to kick me out.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.964
-Maximus.
-E-dawg.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.265
We're doing nicknames now?

04:25.299 --> 04:28.268
If so, I call Dutch Oven.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.738
Wait. No. Can I change mine?

04:30.771 --> 04:31.839
Sorry I missed your calls
last night.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.106
Got stuck on Skype

04:33.140 --> 04:34.975
with a buddy
who's going through a thing.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.076
Was it Brent? (gasps)

04:36.109 --> 04:37.244
Did something happen
with Snoober?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.579
Did they run out of snow?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.280
Nah, it's... Different guy.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.583
Um...

04:42.616 --> 04:43.751
did you talk to Doug?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.953
Yeah, such a bummer
that he split us up.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.621
Bosses, right?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.757
This is just like that movie
Horrible Bosses:

04:49.790 --> 04:51.191
very disappointing.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.662
(laughs) Hey, so, tonight,
you want to check out

04:54.695 --> 04:56.263
Pharrell's sneaker pop-up?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
It's in this Mexican church that
used to be a crepe restaurant.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.701
Doug has me on a crazy deadline.
I'm probs here all night.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.802
-(sighs)
-All right, Edgar.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.971
Cool beans. Stay frosty.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.607
-Yeah.
-Look at this one.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.141
-Let's do it.
-20 thou?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.644
Click your dick in it.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.016
LINDSAY:
Oh, no.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.117
You have dead face.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.787
Ooh, do not sit on this couch!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.121
Or you'll never get up.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.790
Baby booze.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.892
You bone a pilot again?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.860
I slept with Jimmy last night.

05:26.894 --> 05:30.297
What?! So, what does this mean?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.265
Are you with Boone,
or are you with Jimmy?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.302
Gretchen, you have to stop this.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.706
Sleeping with more
than one person is wrong.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.743
(both laugh)

05:44.111 --> 05:46.647
Oh, so, what are you gonna do?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.816
Oh, who knows
what's gonna happen?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.351
We'll just have to see
what the universe sends my way.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.887
"The universe"?
Who are you, Stephen Hawking?

05:55.723 --> 05:58.158
(claps)

05:58.191 --> 06:00.894
Anyway, you can't just let
things happen to you.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.062
(phone buzzes and chimes)

06:05.298 --> 06:06.834
Ha! Olivia just texted me

06:06.867 --> 06:08.669
it's taco night.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.038
I guess the universe
just brought me tacos.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.073
Boone's daughter texts you?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.241
Yeah, all the time.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.209
Look, she dressed her Bitmoji up

06:16.243 --> 06:17.911
to look like me. Little dummy.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.180
This is why

06:20.213 --> 06:22.249
you actually need
to make up your mind.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.184
Don't you see?
You're her La Bamba.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.186
That hunky dillhole

06:26.219 --> 06:27.855
broke my dumb little heart
making me think

06:27.888 --> 06:29.890
he was gonna be my forever papa.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.192
He promised to teach me
how to swim and then, boom.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.694
He just disappeared,

06:33.727 --> 06:35.729
and I had to learn
by watching the dog.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.031
Is that why you shake every time
you get out of the pool?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.700
Gretchen,
you have to break up with Boone

06:39.733 --> 06:41.034
before you mess up Olivia.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.037
This is not like
all the other guys you've boned.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.206
We're talking about
a little girl's life here.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.241
Stop worrying about a kid
you met for 30 seconds

06:48.275 --> 06:50.944
and think about me,
your best friend,

06:50.978 --> 06:53.046
and how maybe I deserve this

06:53.080 --> 06:56.784
after a lifetime of being
everyone's "hit it and quit it."

06:56.817 --> 06:58.318
I don't know
what's gonna happen with Boone

06:58.351 --> 06:59.787
or his daughter or his cat

06:59.820 --> 07:01.288
or his goddamn goldfish,

07:01.321 --> 07:05.058
but, for once, Gretchen
is putting herself first.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.728
So, I'm telling you,
back the hell off.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.497
"For once"?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.244
Oh, excuse me.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.779
You dropped something.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.182
(chuckles)

07:35.789 --> 07:36.757
Oh, you dropped something.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.826
-(panting): I did? -Yeah.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.094
It's, uh... it's, uh,
it's right back there.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.930
-(laughs)
-What was it?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.965
-What? -What did I drop?
What did it look like?

07:44.998 --> 07:48.468
It was... bluish.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.171
-Did I actually drop something?
-Yes.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.109
No. It's just
a funny joke that...

07:56.143 --> 07:58.445
It's funny to stop people

07:58.478 --> 08:00.447
who are actually exercising,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.949
trying to elongate their lives

08:01.982 --> 08:03.383
so they can stick around
for their families

08:03.416 --> 08:05.018
and the people who need them?

08:05.052 --> 08:07.454
And you sit here drinking
in the middle of the day

08:07.487 --> 08:08.989
and you lie to them!

08:09.022 --> 08:11.358
That's funny to you?!

08:11.391 --> 08:12.893
Yes.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.863
You dropped something.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.865
-Oh. Okay.
-(chuckles) Pick it up.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.800
But I don't want it anymore.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.368
Pick it up!

08:26.506 --> 08:29.476
-Now run.
-Huh? What?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.511
(Jimmy whimpers)

08:33.280 --> 08:36.516
Okay, so, "pedo" means "fart."

08:36.550 --> 08:39.553
And "pedo mojad means
"fart with sauce."

08:39.587 --> 08:43.390
Now, "Tu madre es una puta"

08:43.423 --> 08:44.925
means, uh...

08:44.958 --> 08:48.896
Well, it means that your mother
works at night.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.198
Â¿Tu madre es una puta?

08:51.231 --> 08:52.432
You got it.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.533
(knocking on door)

08:53.567 --> 08:55.869
LINDSAY:
Hello?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.104
Hello. It's me, Lindsay.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.840
(laughing):
Taco night!

08:59.873 --> 09:03.243
I'm so excited.
I brought "Patron"

09:03.276 --> 09:05.345
and some limes for margaritas.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.881
-Lindsay, I didn't know you
were coming. -LINDSAY: What?

09:07.915 --> 09:12.052
I'm morgue-ified. Gretchen, you
forgot you invited me, you spaz.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.187
No sweat.
I'll just set another plate.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.523
(whispering):
What the hell are you doing?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.859
Making sure you don't
ruin this kid.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.428
It's bad enough
she's so not cute.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.463
She doesn't need
some selfish adult

09:23.496 --> 09:25.465
giving her abandonment issues
on top of everything else.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.200
I'm gonna set you on fire.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.904
Try it, short-round.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.040
Want Auntie Lindsay to show you
how to do your hair

09:33.073 --> 09:34.541
to minimize...

09:34.574 --> 09:37.210
-help your face?
-Okay.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.879
Tacos are ready. Let's chow.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.481
Shit, yeah! Hard shells.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.254
-WOMAN: Bye, Max.
-See ya. -Later.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.125
Mmm.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.930
-* Ladies and gentlemen *
-* Yeah

09:58.966 --> 10:00.901
* One thousand

10:00.934 --> 10:03.436
* Biz busy on the boards

10:04.437 --> 10:06.439
* Mm-hmm

10:06.473 --> 10:08.275
* Nah, they tired of waitin,'
they say *

10:08.308 --> 10:10.177
* Crae, you sold your soul, man,
your soul, man *

10:10.210 --> 10:13.313
* For real? Who bought it?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.115
* Let the Spirit
take control, man *

10:15.148 --> 10:17.150
* Control, man, control, man

10:17.184 --> 10:20.020
* I don't go nowhere
without Him *

10:20.053 --> 10:21.621
* They scared that I'm-a cause
these babies to stumble *

10:21.655 --> 10:23.490
* They scared that my integrity
is gon' crumble *

10:23.523 --> 10:25.492
* Appreciate the prayers,
but all that pressure *

10:25.525 --> 10:27.094
* Either gon' make you humble

10:27.127 --> 10:28.662
* Or make you hang out on
the sidelines *

10:28.696 --> 10:31.264
* And fear you gon' fumble,
put me in, coach *

10:31.298 --> 10:33.934
* Ain't out here flexin' for
nobody, I was born to do it *

10:33.967 --> 10:35.602
* God don't make mistakes
and say I'm sorry *

10:35.635 --> 10:37.104
* He ain't never dropped
the ball *

10:37.137 --> 10:38.505
* I don't never plan to fumble

10:38.538 --> 10:40.107
* Catch me runnin'
with them lions *

10:40.140 --> 10:42.142
* Reggie Bushin'
in the jungle... *

10:42.175 --> 10:44.978
(indistinct chatter
and laughing)

10:45.012 --> 10:47.014
*

10:53.987 --> 10:56.556
DUTCH:
Mmm.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.125
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.526
Bro.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.995
-What are you doing here?
-Don't "bro" me.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.396
Why are you feeding ravioli
to Dutch?

11:03.430 --> 11:06.299
Oh, actually,
just one is a raviolo.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.635
I know that! Why would you think
I don't know that?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.070
I thought you were
working all night.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.005
I am.
Dutch and I are researching

11:12.039 --> 11:14.241
a cooking class sketch for Doug.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.143
Nothing funny has happened yet,

11:16.176 --> 11:18.378
but that couple over there
is clearly here

11:18.411 --> 11:21.481
as a Hail Mary
before their divorce.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.583
Look, Doug wanted me to keep
this on the DL,

11:23.616 --> 11:25.052
but he asked me to mentor Dutch.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.988
He's a terrible receptionist,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.723
but Doug's too nice
to fire anyone,

11:29.757 --> 11:31.992
so he wants to transition him
into being a writer.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.693
So...

11:33.727 --> 11:37.230
you and Dutch aren't just
hanging out for fun?

11:37.264 --> 11:39.032
Come on, like I'd hang out
with this doof?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.001
Ha. Yeah.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.435
Wait, what?

11:42.469 --> 11:45.005
Okay, well, um... Hey, you want
to kick it tomorrow?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.741
Bringing Dutch up to speed is
gonna be an all-consuming task.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.576
I won't be able to hang
for a while.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.712
But I know Doug.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.681
Pretty soon
he'll get distracted.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.284
He'll start his training
for the U.S. Archery Team

11:57.317 --> 11:59.552
or writing his column
for Mother Jones,

11:59.586 --> 12:01.221
and we'll be back together.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.023
Okay, yeah.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.325
-Sorry for being weird.
-It's okay.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.461
DUTCH:
Okay, new theory:

12:08.495 --> 12:10.030
That's actually his mistress.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.532
See how he's got a ring on
but she doesn't?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.134
Oh, shit.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.769
Little Dutch Boy strikes again.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.105
Yes. Great nickname.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.140
Yeah.

12:25.512 --> 12:29.783
-(indistinct shouting in movie)
-Ah. Come on.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.056
That is ridiculous.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.391
Why would the robot
play football?

12:38.425 --> 12:41.061
Tackling a human would violate
the first law of robotics.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.296
-Shh.
-Oh, d...

12:43.330 --> 12:46.499
-J...
-(woman sighs)

12:46.533 --> 12:49.469
Sorry.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.504
(shouting in movie)

12:56.443 --> 12:58.578
So, when I first moved to L.A.,

12:58.611 --> 13:01.281
this dude told me
that the Griffith Observatory

13:01.314 --> 13:02.749
was Alex Trebek's house.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.085
-Mm.
-I believed him for years.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.820
I can't tell you
how many people I told,

13:06.854 --> 13:08.822
-"That's Alex Trebek's house."
-GRETCHEN: Trebek sucks.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.124
Pat and Vanna forever.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.760
You love Wheel, don't you, Liv?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.628
Always select the "T" first.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.265
The most commonly used letters
spell out "eat irons."

13:18.298 --> 13:20.500
Solve the puzzle as soon
as you know it,

13:20.533 --> 13:23.170
and spinning for extra thousands
isn't worth the risk.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.538
-Good girl.
-All right, girlie.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.773
Bedtime for Bonzo.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.575
Ten more minutes.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.113
Fine.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.682
All right, I have to oversee
this bedtime situation,

13:35.715 --> 13:38.818
or she'll sit on the toilet and
read till her butt falls off.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.722
-(whispering): Nerd. -Lindsay,
I'm so glad you came over.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.391
-You can really house
some tacos. -Thanks.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.326
I taught myself how to breathe
through my nose

13:46.359 --> 13:48.695
-so I could chew longer.
-(Lindsay and Boone laugh)

13:53.366 --> 13:55.502
Good night, Gretchen.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.703
BOONE:
All right, come on.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.139
See?

13:59.172 --> 14:02.309
Everything's fine.
Everyone's healthy.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.578
We're just hanging out
(whispering): like people.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.380
You were right. I'm sorry.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.150
It's just, you're here so often,
I got jealous.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.819
But, honestly, seeing the two
of you together...

14:12.852 --> 14:14.687
is really cute.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.359
Well, I'm out.
Priscilla's really laying on

14:19.392 --> 14:21.728
the night work lately.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.700
Hey... I love you.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.169
I love you, too.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.703
Thank you for trusting me.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
(sighs)

14:48.455 --> 14:51.191
BOY:
Hey, Jimmy.

14:51.224 --> 14:55.528
And my hallucinations are Irish.
Perfect.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.265
No, Spirit.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.800
I'm not the racist Shive-Overly
you're after.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.402
You'll find old Ronnie's ashes

15:02.435 --> 15:04.504
spread over Tony Shalhoub's
succulents.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.808
Neighbor boy.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.443
We all figured you for dead.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.212
Turns out my missing dad's
been here

15:12.245 --> 15:13.713
at O'Callaghan's
this whole time.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.883
So now I'm working nights
to pay off his bar tab.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.953
Life's tough,
but it'll be over eventually.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.554
How've you been, Jimmy?

15:21.588 --> 15:25.225
Life is a festering wound,
my boy.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.893
You enjoy your youth.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.462
It's all downhill from here.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.798
Oh, no. It gets worse?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.778
Thanks, Jimmy.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.787
I got my car booze.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.991
You're lucky
I keep it handy now.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.467
I came back to town
to face the music.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.802
But it didn't want to face me.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.306
Let's go play pinball.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.674
Bah.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.280
Hello, Edgar.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.315
Not today, Satan.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.885
*

16:27.320 --> 16:28.821
-What?!
-Shh...!

16:28.855 --> 16:30.623
I'm a grouch.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.958
Why are you in my trash?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.493
I have to tell you something.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.495
You have to break up
with Gretchen.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.530
-What? Why?
-For Olivia.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.633
I saw how she was looking at
Gretchen tonight. She loves her.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.702
And Gretchen is
such a toxic need-ball.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.737
She's just gonna keep getting
closer and closer,

16:44.771 --> 16:46.806
and one day she's gonna realize

16:46.839 --> 16:48.708
you're actually kind of basic,

16:48.741 --> 16:51.644
and she'll disappear, and you'll
start dating John Stamos...

16:51.678 --> 16:52.879
-John Stamos?
-And it's going

16:52.912 --> 16:54.647
to break
Olivia's little fool heart.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.016
Her heart is going to break.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.486
I'm sorry, but your girlfriend's
not a solid person.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.687
I know that.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.522
She barely showers.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.325
And she steals Olivia's desserts
from her lunch box.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.826
But I like her.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.329
And she likes me.
And I know

17:09.362 --> 17:12.065
what I'm getting into,
because I'm an adult.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.501
And you're a girl
in a trash can.

17:14.534 --> 17:18.471
And you don't know anything
about our relationship.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.941
Well, there's one thing
you don know:

17:21.974 --> 17:23.943
Gretchen's not over Jimmy.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.013
He could pick up the phone,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.116
and she'd be at his house
in two seconds.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.819
Get out of my trash and go home.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.789
*

17:52.939 --> 17:56.042
-Do you have taco meat
in your mouth? -No.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.111
Move in with me.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.712
(swallows)

17:59.746 --> 18:02.649
(trembling):
Um... okay.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.485
(Gretchen gasps)

18:06.486 --> 18:08.621
(both laugh softly)

18:11.424 --> 18:13.426
*

18:15.762 --> 18:18.798
JIMMY:
Los Angeles is dead.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.734
It's a quartz mausoleum
of vape shops,

18:21.768 --> 18:23.436
YouTube Red billboards

18:23.470 --> 18:24.904
and poke restaurants.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.807
And, as I discovered
so viscerally today,

18:27.840 --> 18:30.443
everything that used to be fun
is no longer so.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.146
You think maybe
it's Gretchen? Like...

18:33.180 --> 18:35.615
after her, you now
can't enjoy it without her?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.016
They're offering me
a multi-book deal,

18:37.049 --> 18:39.118
writing the Peach Quadrilogy.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.521
Luckily, I can write anywhere.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.927
I told you, Edgar,
the city is ruined for me.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.929
It's time to go.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.098
Whoa.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.467
Are you gonna tell Gretchen?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.603
Nope. She's done with me,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.538
and she doesn't care anymore.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.812
I don't want you to go,
but I won't try to stop you.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.984
Thank you.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.120
In the Paktika Province,
I was supposed to go AWOL

19:14.153 --> 19:15.955
with my battle buddy Bowe,
but...

19:15.988 --> 19:18.525
he ditched me
while I was in the crapper.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.862
Everyone goes away eventually.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.636
And now I'm losing Max.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.639
That dainty little worm-boy
with the tiny mustache?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.642
Doug split us up.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.212
I should just find
a new partner.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.881
Unless you think
I should talk to Doug about it.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.483
Listen, Edgar,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.653
the only person you
can truly rely on is yourself.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.588
My best advice would be

19:48.621 --> 19:52.725
to accept your new reality
and... move on.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.867
Also, my thanking you
for not trying to stop me

20:00.900 --> 20:03.169
is in no way an admission
that you could stop me,

20:03.202 --> 20:05.705
as you have no influence
over my actions whatsoever.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.973
Obviously.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.192
Bro, I think you left
the pizza in your car.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.561
No, I'm-I'm not the pizza guy.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.731
Doug, it's me, Edgar.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.199
I work for you.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.134
Marketing?

20:35.167 --> 20:36.603
Nano Communications?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.638
(whispers):
Black Ops?

20:39.639 --> 20:41.608
Oh, right, the show.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.776
-Guido Baby guy.
-Listen, I came to,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.545
uh, tell you that...

20:45.578 --> 20:48.047
(exhales)
you're ruining my life.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.917
-Oh, no. -I've never had
a friend like Max.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.720
He's the only person who's
ever treated me like an equal.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.222
He sees something in me
I didn't know was there.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.224
And just when
we were really getting

20:58.257 --> 21:00.126
to that next level of intimacy,

21:00.159 --> 21:01.828
you split us up!
I mean...

21:01.861 --> 21:04.597
are you really so threatened
by our talent?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.933
(trembling exhale)

21:07.934 --> 21:09.569
Edgar...

21:09.602 --> 21:12.639
I am so ashamed.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.741
You get to a certain point
in your career

21:14.774 --> 21:15.975
where you think you're safe,

21:16.008 --> 21:18.578
and then one day, inevitably,

21:18.611 --> 21:21.914
you look up and see Mozart
in the rearview mirror...

21:21.948 --> 21:23.650
and you realize:

21:23.683 --> 21:27.086
Holy shit, I'm Salieri!

21:27.119 --> 21:30.590
Your scary talent
has me so spooked

21:30.623 --> 21:33.993
that I've been punishing you
when I should be elevating you.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.028
Well, I-I didn't mean it
like that.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.630
Not another word.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.265
I'm giving you a promotion.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.634
Now, I don't want you
to freak out,

21:41.668 --> 21:44.771
but hell, kid, you deserve it.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.005
Edgar...

21:46.038 --> 21:48.641
you're the on-set writer now.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.677
What?! Oh, my G...

21:50.710 --> 21:52.211
Wow. Thank you.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.714
Uh, but what about Max?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.282
Max isn't ready.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.884
You are.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.352
Great. Okay.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.354
I will not let you down.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.222
When do I start?

22:03.255 --> 22:05.858
Right now. That
Inappropriate Gravedigger sketch

22:05.892 --> 22:07.894
you wrote for Paul F. Tompkins?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.962
-Mm-hmm. -I'm shooting it
overnight in Downey.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.899
-Mm.
-So take the 710 to the 105,

22:12.932 --> 22:15.301
look for the yellow signs.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.904
So brave of you
to show up at my house

22:17.937 --> 22:21.240
at 9:00 on a weeknight
to yell at me about your job.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.210
You're gonna go far in this town

22:24.243 --> 22:26.345
with that kind
of political savvy.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.418
DOUG:
Tova! Pizza's here!

22:37.724 --> 22:39.726
(snoring softly)

22:46.365 --> 22:48.701
(snoring continues)

23:00.379 --> 23:02.882
*

23:20.733 --> 23:23.770
*

23:23.803 --> 23:27.239
* In spite of being

23:27.273 --> 23:29.976
* So late

23:30.009 --> 23:32.244
* To the game

23:33.412 --> 23:36.382
* I won't

23:36.415 --> 23:38.751
* Fight fate
