01:18.811 --> 01:22.191
It's an excellent likeness
of James Pendrick,

01:22.191 --> 01:25.391
wouldn't you agree, Willie?
Excellent, yes.

01:25.391 --> 01:30.051
But the building itself
is a far better portrait of the man.

01:30.051 --> 01:32.631
Solid steel, reinforced
concrete skeleton.

01:32.631 --> 01:37.791
Gearless traction electric elevators
and a full 11 storeys.

01:37.791 --> 01:42.131
Julia, could you imagine
anything so grand in Toronto?

01:48.431 --> 01:51.231
William, it's breathtaking.

01:51.231 --> 01:54.031
Oh, breathtaking, yes.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.591
No more masonry wall,
load transference ratios...

01:57.591 --> 02:02.771
Bathsheba At Her Bath
is a true vessel of tragedy.

02:02.771 --> 02:05.771
The most exquisite nude
of Rembrandt's career.

02:05.771 --> 02:09.491
We are indebted to Mrs Pendrick
for sharing this jewel with us

02:09.491 --> 02:13.011
at this most prestigious
of showings. Signore Carducci,

02:13.011 --> 02:15.651
il moto gentile.
James and I are delighted

02:15.651 --> 02:18.411
that an art connoisseur
like yourself could join us.

02:18.411 --> 02:22.971
I came to Canada in search of rising
young talent, but what do I find?

02:22.971 --> 02:27.011
A European masterpiece endowing
its light upon the colonies.

02:27.011 --> 02:29.891
Really, do we have to endure
this asinine twaddle?

02:29.891 --> 02:32.291
Grovelling over long-dead painters.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.551
Such impertinence, such fire!

02:35.551 --> 02:39.071
Art is a living, breathing organism.

02:39.071 --> 02:42.131
What is this snobbish obsession
with anything ancient?

02:42.131 --> 02:46.591
My dear Burt, the difference between
the dead masters and you moderns

02:46.591 --> 02:48.911
is that the dead
have better manners.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.571
Oh, William, it's simply stunning.

02:53.571 --> 02:58.211
See how Rembrandt made equal use
of agitated and serene brushstrokes.

02:58.211 --> 03:01.171
She's beautiful, and haunting.

03:01.171 --> 03:04.691
Note the rich, ochre pigment
of the robe.

03:04.691 --> 03:09.411
So rare to see a nude that portrays
a woman as a whole person.

03:09.411 --> 03:11.831
An astute observation.

03:11.831 --> 03:13.951
Dr Julia Ogden, is it not?

03:13.951 --> 03:15.831
Why, yes. Mrs Pendrick.

03:15.831 --> 03:18.171
Your father talks incessantly
about your accomplishments.

03:18.171 --> 03:20.151
Well, not to me!

03:20.151 --> 03:22.211
It's so good of you to join us.

03:22.211 --> 03:23.971
And this gentleman?

03:23.971 --> 03:27.731
Detective William Murdoch,
of the Toronto Constabulary.

03:27.731 --> 03:31.651
I was told they'd send their finest
to keep an eye on my painting.

03:31.651 --> 03:35.511
It's an honour to guard
such a masterpiece, Mrs Pendrick.

03:35.511 --> 03:38.931
I take it you're familiar with
Rembrandt's work, Detective?

03:38.931 --> 03:41.431
To some small extent.

03:41.431 --> 03:44.011
Then you're aware that his model
was Hendrickje Stoffels?

03:44.011 --> 03:46.691
Yes, his mistress of many years,
I believe.

03:46.691 --> 03:48.171
Correct.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.611
Perhaps that's why
he was able to evoke

03:52.611 --> 03:55.091
so much compassion on the canvas.

03:55.091 --> 03:56.811
Such raw intimacy.

03:59.231 --> 04:00.691
Perhaps.

04:03.831 --> 04:06.171
How much longer is this soiree
supposed to last?

04:06.171 --> 04:07.631
About another hour, I think.

04:09.251 --> 04:12.591
Must be some painting if Pendrick's
own security isn't enough.

04:12.591 --> 04:16.250
A priceless painting of a woman
sans clothing, I'm told.

04:16.250 --> 04:20.491
Seems a shame to hide it
away in the Pendrick mansion
where no-one else can see it.

04:20.491 --> 04:25.071
Once again, thank you all for
coming. It has been our pleasure
to share such a treasure with you.

04:25.071 --> 04:28.131
Now it's time to put
this fine lady to bed.

04:28.131 --> 04:29.611
Clarkson, thank you.

04:59.871 --> 05:01.411
Here she comes.

05:01.411 --> 05:03.091
It's moving at quite a speed.

05:03.091 --> 05:06.531
State-of-the-art technology,
so Detective Murdoch tells me.

05:10.871 --> 05:15.031
I'm glad it's not me up there.
I get dizzy standing on a ladder.

05:15.031 --> 05:17.151
I bet you could overcome that,
Higgins.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.531
The idea would be to start
with a diminutive ladder,

05:19.531 --> 05:22.531
then each day progressing to
a slightly larger ladder until...

05:22.531 --> 05:24.851
You had an excess of ladders.

05:28.471 --> 05:30.851
She's something fast, all right.

05:35.831 --> 05:38.191
LIFT DINGS

05:43.011 --> 05:45.151
My God.

05:45.151 --> 05:47.171
I think he's dead.

05:47.171 --> 05:48.931
And where's the Rembrandt?

05:59.191 --> 06:01.451
Sir, I don't understand
how it's possible.

06:01.451 --> 06:03.371
The elevator did not stop, I swear.

06:03.371 --> 06:06.511
Paintings, priceless or otherwise,
don't just disappear.

06:06.511 --> 06:08.631
Sir, I watched the dial
with my own eyes. As did I.

06:08.631 --> 06:11.691
In the meantime, George, as the
building search gets underway...

06:11.691 --> 06:14.931
You'll need statements
from the guests, did they see
anything untoward and such.

06:14.931 --> 06:16.431
Thank you, George.

06:18.471 --> 06:20.291
What have you, doctor?

06:20.291 --> 06:24.691
A small knife wound
below the shoulder blade,
no doubt piercing the heart.

06:25.731 --> 06:28.771
He died instantly?
Within seconds, I should think.

06:29.951 --> 06:35.031
The killer, or killers most likely,
could have been on top of the car,

06:35.031 --> 06:38.211
and entered and exited
through the hatch.

06:43.491 --> 06:45.491
Nothing up here.

06:50.091 --> 06:53.431
But the opening is far too small
for that painting to fit through.

06:53.431 --> 06:55.451
Could it have been
cut from the frame?

06:55.451 --> 07:00.851
Any attempt to fold or roll a
painting as old as a Rembrandt would
destroy it and render it worthless.

07:00.851 --> 07:03.871
It would have had to be taken
in its frame.

07:03.871 --> 07:07.791
Dear God, how could this happen?

07:07.791 --> 07:12.651
Poor Clarkson. I don't understand,
my security was impeccable.
Excuse me, doctor.

07:12.651 --> 07:16.471
Mr Pendrick? Detective William
Murdoch of the Toronto Constabulary.

07:16.471 --> 07:19.091
Detective, who would do such
a thing, murder an innocent man?

07:19.091 --> 07:22.031
It's clearly the work of
brazen professionals.

07:22.031 --> 07:26.271
However, I assure you, they will be
caught and your painting recovered.

07:26.271 --> 07:31.231
I will need a list of
all your staff, as well as
the caterers, musicians, waiters.

07:31.231 --> 07:35.791
Of course. Whoever orchestrated
this heinous crime had to have
access to the building.

07:35.791 --> 07:38.571
As well as a detailed understanding
of the physical structure

07:38.571 --> 07:40.891
and a schedule of this evening's
activities.

07:40.891 --> 07:46.191
You shall have everything you need.
If you'll excuse me, I must break
the terrible news to my wife.

07:46.191 --> 07:48.371
Sir?
You're needed on the third floor.

07:48.371 --> 07:50.851
I think we've discovered
how they escaped.

07:58.051 --> 08:02.131
Right then, Henry.
Get photographs and finger marks.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.631
And collect the rope.

08:06.281 --> 08:09.781
My desk's covered with telegrams
from broadsheets around the world

08:09.781 --> 08:12.601
wanting to know how a masterpiece
disappears into thin air.

08:12.601 --> 08:15.621
It didn't disappear.
A logical explanation will surface.

08:15.621 --> 08:19.241
These thieves have got
a bloody cheek. Why the lift?

08:19.241 --> 08:24.121
The elevator ride was the only time
the Rembrandt wasn't
under direct police watch.

08:24.121 --> 08:26.401
Makes sense. Scared of us.

08:26.401 --> 08:28.181
And the guard, was he part of it?

08:28.181 --> 08:31.761
Frederick Clarkson, a family man
with impeccable credentials.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.601
I'm convinced he was not involved.

08:33.601 --> 08:35.861
So the motive - ransom?

08:35.861 --> 08:37.900
No demands have arrived. Hmmm.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.140
Exactly how much is
this painting worth?

08:40.140 --> 08:46.901
A Rembrandt, Signore.
Its value to civilisation cannot be
equated in dollars and lira.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.481
Signore Luca Carducci
at your service.

08:50.481 --> 08:52.321
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

08:52.321 --> 08:54.081
The pleasure is mine.

08:54.081 --> 08:58.441
Apparently. I met Signore Carducci
at the unveiling last night.

08:58.441 --> 09:03.421
He represents several European
galleries and is renowned
in international art circles.

09:03.421 --> 09:05.681
Ah. Wonderful. I've asked him
for his expert advice.

09:05.681 --> 09:08.341
Anything I can do to help
secure Bathsheba's return.

09:08.341 --> 09:13.101
So in crass monetary terms, please,
Mr Carducci, how much is she worth?

09:13.101 --> 09:16.481
A Rembrandt painted in 1654?

09:16.481 --> 09:20.341
$40,000, perhaps more.

09:20.341 --> 09:25.601
So it could be ransomed. Or sold to
some unscrupulous private collector.

09:25.601 --> 09:30.681
I would think a work of art
as famous and costly as a Rembrandt
would be hard to sell.

09:30.681 --> 09:34.401
In this provincial town? Absolutely.

09:34.401 --> 09:38.221
So the thieves would want to get it
out of Toronto. But how? A fence?

09:38.221 --> 09:42.861
Not here,
but there are such characters
in the international art world.

09:42.861 --> 09:47.841
Where would they try to sell it?
Europe? Possibly, but more likely
New York or Buffalo.

09:47.841 --> 09:51.481
The nouveau riche have a voracious
appetite for acquisition.

09:51.481 --> 09:53.761
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.761
You're most welcome,
and good luck, Signore.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.921
Bloody arty types.

10:01.921 --> 10:04.661
There is another possibility
here, sir.

10:04.661 --> 10:07.381
Mr Pendrick could have
orchestrated his own theft.

10:07.381 --> 10:10.881
Insurance fraud?
But why? The bugger's filthy rich.

10:10.881 --> 10:14.081
Nevertheless, an avenue
we should explore. Agreed.

10:14.081 --> 10:20.221
"Bathsheba At Her Bath".
A lady's bathing ritual
should not be spied upon.

10:43.521 --> 10:46.501
Mr Pendrick? Ah, Detective.

10:48.781 --> 10:55.401
Excuse me. I can't stop
thinking about poor Clarkson -
keeping the mind occupied helps.

10:55.401 --> 10:58.321
Indeed. What are you working on?

10:58.321 --> 11:02.621
It's a mechanism that will drive
a model of the solar system,
based on Eisinga's work.

11:02.621 --> 11:06.061
The Dutchman who created
the planetarium? Yes, in 1781.

11:06.061 --> 11:10.941
It's astonishing - he calculated
the movement of the planets
to an accuracy within seconds.

11:10.941 --> 11:14.301
Fascinating man.
Amateur astronomer, wood carver...

11:14.301 --> 11:20.001
Eisinga's model filled
an entire room. Mine will fit
into the palm of your hand.

11:20.001 --> 11:23.641
It's remarkable. My wife took me to
a flea circus, I thought, "Why not

11:23.641 --> 11:27.441
"combine the two ideas? Produce a
planetarium on a minuscule scale."

11:27.441 --> 11:32.421
I myself am fascinated by the idea
that one day, tiny electrical
circuits will be capable

11:32.421 --> 11:35.221
of calculating vast
mathematical algorithms.

11:35.221 --> 11:38.221
Yes, you understand. Miniaturisation
is the key to the future.

11:38.221 --> 11:41.981
Yet you designed
the tallest building in Toronto.

11:41.981 --> 11:45.581
That thing? Obsolete
before the last rivet went in.

11:45.581 --> 11:49.761
I'm already developing new alloys
that are lighter and stronger.

11:49.761 --> 11:54.201
Now, have you any idea
who murdered Clarkson
and made off with the Rembrandt?

11:54.201 --> 11:56.221
It's early stages still.

11:56.221 --> 11:59.601
There's a strong possibility
you'll receive a ransom note.

11:59.601 --> 12:02.381
If one arrives,
I will contact you immediately.

12:02.381 --> 12:05.441
But surely, you didn't come here
to ask me the obvious.

12:05.441 --> 12:08.001
No, I didn't.

12:08.001 --> 12:10.681
I take it you had an insurance
policy on the painting?

12:12.241 --> 12:13.821
I see.

12:13.821 --> 12:16.481
Of course you have to ask,
I'd expect nothing less.

12:16.481 --> 12:18.241
Yes, the Rembrandt was insured.

12:18.241 --> 12:21.881
I'll need to see the policy.
I'll have it sent along.

12:21.881 --> 12:27.001
Though I'm confident
your scientific mind will lead to
the recovery of the Rembrandt.

12:27.001 --> 12:28.561
Thank you.

12:28.561 --> 12:30.161
One more thing.

12:30.161 --> 12:33.261
Clearly the Rembrandt
would be a coveted possession.

12:33.261 --> 12:37.321
There was quite a frenzied
bidding process in Vienna.

12:37.321 --> 12:41.441
Do you have any idea who
the other potential buyers
may have been?

12:41.441 --> 12:44.441
That's a question for my wife.
The art world is her domain.

12:44.441 --> 12:47.241
Where might I find Mrs Pendrick?

12:47.241 --> 12:49.301
I believe she's by the pool.

13:06.401 --> 13:08.121
Oh, excuse me.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.901
I'm sorry.

13:09.901 --> 13:12.361
Why hello, Detective Murdoch.

13:12.361 --> 13:15.341
Perhaps another time would be
better, I'll... Nonsense.

13:15.341 --> 13:17.161
We are trying to work here.

13:17.161 --> 13:22.541
It's all right, Burt. Detective
Murdoch's investigation is far more
important than my portrait.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.381
Rembrandt stolen, world ends.

13:24.381 --> 13:27.681
Mr Lightman is very passionate
about modern art.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.981
And his opinions, aren't you, Burt?

13:32.161 --> 13:34.701
How can I help you, Detective?

13:36.341 --> 13:40.401
Your husband tells me your purchase
of the Rembrandt caused quite a stir
in the art world.

13:40.401 --> 13:46.341
My competitors pushed the bidding
higher and higher,
certain I'd lose my nerve.

13:46.341 --> 13:49.781
Any idea who these
prospective buyers were?

13:49.781 --> 13:52.821
All the prestigious galleries.
A few well-heeled individuals.

13:52.821 --> 13:56.161
It was quite scandalous for
a woman to secure the painting.

13:56.161 --> 13:58.721
Were any of them disgruntled enough
to steal it?

13:58.721 --> 14:00.501
What a terrible thought.

14:00.501 --> 14:03.041
But I suppose.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.441
I'll need a list of names,
if possible.

14:05.441 --> 14:07.001
Yes, of course.

14:08.921 --> 14:10.701
Ice water?

14:12.081 --> 14:14.101
Thank you.

14:15.841 --> 14:19.901
Your comments last night
on Rembrandt's technique
tell me you're an art lover.

14:21.981 --> 14:24.001
I was educated by Jesuits.

14:24.001 --> 14:27.961
They use the Classics as hooks
to capture our young souls.

14:27.961 --> 14:30.601
However, I'm less familiar
with the moderns.

14:30.601 --> 14:34.121
Then allow me to
contribute to your education.

14:34.121 --> 14:36.021
You must see Burt's work.

14:36.021 --> 14:39.821
Oh, I... Mrs Pendrick,
the painting is not yet finished.

14:39.821 --> 14:44.621
I must insist that he...
Don't be so precious, Burt.
Detective Murdoch is interested.

14:47.241 --> 14:50.641
What's your first thought?

14:50.641 --> 14:53.441
It's...a challenging composition.

14:53.441 --> 14:58.461
I use only primary colours,
to better highlight the dynamic
tension between geometric figures.

14:58.461 --> 15:01.161
Burt's style will light
the way of the future.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.501
Then I'll be sure to
pay closer attention.

15:08.981 --> 15:12.561
The Pendricks made quite an
impression when they first arrived.

15:12.561 --> 15:19.381
Father says James Pendrick is brash,
but he never liked new ideas
upsetting his world order.

15:19.381 --> 15:23.321
Mr Pendrick is something
of a revolutionary thinker.

15:23.321 --> 15:25.241
So you and he are quite like-minded?

15:25.241 --> 15:29.281
His wife seems refreshingly modern,
don't you think?

15:29.281 --> 15:31.421
Yes. Quite modern.

15:33.501 --> 15:36.341
Has your post-mortem
determined anything? Indeed.

15:36.341 --> 15:39.681
As I suspected, the victim died from
a single stab wound to the heart.

15:39.681 --> 15:41.641
But here's what's interesting.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.641
The guard's right ankle was broken.

15:44.801 --> 15:49.521
That's strange.
I saw him walk into the elevator.
There was no evidence of injury.

15:49.521 --> 15:52.241
Agreed. Yet it is broken.

15:52.241 --> 15:55.501
So how could he break an ankle
inside an elevator?

15:55.501 --> 15:57.081
Could it have fallen?

16:04.721 --> 16:06.741
The elevator didn't fall.

16:09.361 --> 16:11.661
But the guard did.

16:11.661 --> 16:15.121
Sir, how did he fall in an elevator?

16:15.121 --> 16:18.881
He didn't fall in the elevator,
he fell into the elevator.

16:18.881 --> 16:21.001
Thank you.
I'm not following you, sir.

16:21.001 --> 16:24.321
There were two elevator cars.

16:24.321 --> 16:26.601
Two elevator cars?
 See?

16:26.601 --> 16:30.261
Here. These are screw holes.

16:32.621 --> 16:36.861
A second, false car
was built on top of this one.

16:40.341 --> 16:43.561
So the guard and the painting
enter the false car.

16:43.561 --> 16:50.441
As the elevator makes it way down,
the thieves, stationed in
the car below, open the hatch.

16:50.441 --> 16:52.801
The guard falls into the car.

16:52.801 --> 16:55.521
In doing so, he breaks his ankle.

16:55.521 --> 16:57.281
The thieves murder him

16:57.281 --> 17:00.201
and climb up into the false car.

17:00.201 --> 17:05.080
The dead guard then continues his
journey down to the first floor.

17:05.080 --> 17:09.621
So Constable Higgins and I discover
him in the real elevator car,

17:09.621 --> 17:12.021
everyone assumes the crime
occurred there.

17:12.021 --> 17:15.121
And while we're busying ourselves
searching down below,

17:15.121 --> 17:20.281
the thieves and the painting
got out here, on the second floor.

17:20.281 --> 17:22.221
I think I can take it
from there, sir.

17:22.221 --> 17:24.621
They then dismantle
the false elevator car,

17:24.621 --> 17:29.841
stash the materials somewhere nearby,
then go up to the third floor
where they escape down the rope.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.241
No, George, the rope was a ruse.

17:32.241 --> 17:38.121
They wanted us to think they escaped
from the third floor so we would
focus our search there. Why that?

17:38.121 --> 17:42.301
How did they get the painting out of
a building surrounded by policemen?

17:42.301 --> 17:44.381
Well, I don't imagine
they could, sir.

17:44.381 --> 17:48.481
Precisely, meaning they didn't
leave the building immediately.

17:48.481 --> 17:50.241
They laid low,

17:50.241 --> 17:53.141
right under our noses
until the commotion passed.

17:53.141 --> 17:54.961
Yes, and once we had left...

17:54.961 --> 17:57.961
They slip off into the night.
That's a nervy pair of thieves, sir.

17:57.961 --> 18:00.221
Yes, it's an ingenious plan.

18:05.781 --> 18:08.061
And I think we've found
their hiding place.

18:08.061 --> 18:10.381
George, have you your skeleton key?

18:18.781 --> 18:21.021
The remains of the false elevator.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.641
So, the thieves
removed the painting from its frame,

18:27.641 --> 18:30.421
keeping it mounted
on the stretcher.

18:30.421 --> 18:33.401
Waited for the coast to clear
before they made their getaway.

18:33.401 --> 18:35.261
I agree with part of your theory,
sir.

18:35.261 --> 18:38.781
Oh? What part don't you agree with?
The getaway part, actually.

18:51.121 --> 18:52.661
Point taken, George.

18:52.661 --> 18:55.341
Sir, if the thieves are dead,
who has the painting?

19:08.699 --> 19:11.479
Both thieves died
in the same extraordinary manner.

19:11.479 --> 19:16.079
A sharp, thin object
pierced the right eardrum, entering
the soft tissue of the brain.

19:16.079 --> 19:18.059
They died of cerebral haemorrhage.

19:18.059 --> 19:19.679
Murder weapon?

19:19.679 --> 19:22.999
I'll have to examine both brains
to get an exact description.

19:22.999 --> 19:26.059
Thank you, that would be
most helpful. Time of death?

19:26.059 --> 19:30.499
I'd estimate they died in
the early hours of the morning,
between 3 and 4am.

19:30.499 --> 19:33.439
Any defensive wounds? None.

19:33.439 --> 19:37.739
So either the killer managed to
surprise two ruthless thieves...

19:37.739 --> 19:39.459
Or they let their guard down.

19:39.459 --> 19:40.939
But why would they do that?

19:46.379 --> 19:48.559
Sir, do you have a moment?

19:48.559 --> 19:50.139
Yes, of course, George.

19:50.139 --> 19:53.819
I'm just inspecting
the dead thieves' clothing.

19:53.819 --> 19:57.619
We followed up on the rope used in
the getaway. It's commonly obtained.

19:57.619 --> 20:02.959
No merchants recall selling it
to anyone matching the thieves'
description. Finger marks?

20:02.959 --> 20:05.219
Sorry, sir. I guess they used gloves.

20:05.219 --> 20:08.719
That's unfortunate. Thank you.

20:08.719 --> 20:12.899
Sir, I can't stop thinking
what a terrible way to die,

20:12.899 --> 20:16.779
to have a sharp object
plunged into your ear canal.

20:16.779 --> 20:22.199
Indeed. I see the killer's logic.
He needed to access the brain
without interceding bone matter.

20:22.199 --> 20:27.679
Still, the ear seems such a delicate
part of the body. Yes, it does.

20:27.679 --> 20:29.759
He could have gone up
through the nose, I suppose.

20:29.759 --> 20:32.159
But that wouldn't be much better,
would it?

20:32.159 --> 20:35.019
Then there's the eye socket.
That's even worse.

20:35.019 --> 20:38.699
You'd see the weapon coming
towards you... Thank you, George.
That's quite enough.

20:38.699 --> 20:41.219
Forgive me, sir. Terrible business.

20:42.299 --> 20:45.219
George, did you speak with
the catering company? I did.

20:45.219 --> 20:47.339
They reported no uniforms missing.

20:48.919 --> 20:51.279
Then how did the thieves
obtain these?

20:51.279 --> 20:53.239
I suppose they had them sewn up.

20:53.239 --> 20:56.799
The company's uniforms were made
here in Toronto, were they not?

20:56.799 --> 21:00.259
Yes, sir. Goldberg Tailors on
Spadina. Have you found something?

21:02.339 --> 21:07.439
Yes, George. I believe
the art thieves were from Chicago.

21:07.439 --> 21:10.259
Jonah Watson and Cyril Hughes.

21:10.259 --> 21:14.839
Professional thieves
wanted in Chicago for
the armed robbery of several banks.

21:14.839 --> 21:18.339
Dangerous characters but someone
managed to kill the pair of them.

21:18.339 --> 21:22.139
I believe they were murdered
when they handed over the painting
to whomever hired them.

21:22.139 --> 21:25.679
The partner who supplied them
with all the inside information.

21:25.679 --> 21:30.099
Exactly, the mastermind behind
the theft. And then this mastermind
double crosses them.

21:30.099 --> 21:31.419
Tying up all loose ends.

21:31.419 --> 21:33.079
KNOCK AT DOOR
Come in.

21:33.079 --> 21:35.459
Pendrick still
hasn't received a note.

21:35.459 --> 21:37.199
I think we can
safely rule out ransom.

21:37.199 --> 21:38.879
So where did the painting go?

21:38.879 --> 21:41.439
No doubt on its way
to a private collector.

21:41.439 --> 21:45.099
Actually, sirs, it might be that
your earlier instincts were correct.

21:47.459 --> 21:50.619
I've already told you
I had the Rembrandt insured.

21:50.619 --> 21:54.519
But you didn't mention you increased
the policy to $200,000.

21:54.519 --> 21:56.819
The painting's value is
one fifth of that.

21:56.819 --> 21:59.759
Do you see this Goya?

21:59.759 --> 22:02.979
I paid $300 for it five years ago.

22:02.979 --> 22:05.139
What do you wager it's worth today?

22:06.719 --> 22:10.999
I suspect its value
has increased somewhat. Tenfold.

22:10.999 --> 22:15.619
I've had offers of $3,000 and more,
but I like this one - it relaxes me.

22:15.619 --> 22:18.519
And I'm told it matches the room.

22:18.519 --> 22:23.839
You insure art for
what some fool may pay for it,
not what it's worth in the moment.

22:23.839 --> 22:28.059
Is that what your art collection is
to you, Mr Pendrick, an investment?

22:28.059 --> 22:32.739
I'm afraid it doesn't captivate
my mind as it does my wife's.

22:32.739 --> 22:34.399
Shame, really.

22:34.399 --> 22:36.719
Common interests
solidify a marriage.

22:36.719 --> 22:42.079
And what woman do you know
has the least interest
in steel and concrete?

22:42.079 --> 22:44.699
At any rate,
the value of the Rembrandt is moot

22:44.699 --> 22:48.279
since I'm sure you'll recover it.
Is there anything else, Detective?

22:48.279 --> 22:51.299
Yes, I'm wondering if you know
where Mr Carducci is.

22:51.299 --> 22:54.519
Carducci. I can't be sure,

22:54.519 --> 22:59.199
though I understand he takes an
interest in young, male painters.

22:59.199 --> 23:02.059
Try Burt Lightman's studio.

23:02.059 --> 23:04.139
I believe it's on the esplanade.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.299
EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYS

23:07.299 --> 23:09.299
CHATTERING

23:33.739 --> 23:35.459
Detective Murdoch.

23:37.919 --> 23:41.759
What a pleasant surprise.
Good day, Mrs Pendrick.

23:41.759 --> 23:45.759
I see you're taking your interest
in the moderns seriously.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.859
Actually, I'm here to see
Signore Carducci.

23:48.859 --> 23:52.059
I believe he's monopolising
my favourite painter.

24:03.839 --> 24:07.959
Signore Carducci, you're much
in demand. Detective Murdoch.

24:07.959 --> 24:12.819
Have you brought us good news
about our lovely Bathsheba?
They're welcome to that old relic.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.299
My dear Burt. Someday,
you'll be the old master
to our great-grandchildren.

24:16.299 --> 24:21.539
You're too kind. No, Signora
Pendrick is right. This gentleman
will soon be the talk of all Europe.

24:21.539 --> 24:23.279
Are you leaving us, Burt?

24:23.279 --> 24:29.359
I'm going to Paris. Signore Carducci
will introduce me in all the right
circles. How marvellous.

24:33.379 --> 24:36.099
So how can I be of assistance,
Detective?

24:37.699 --> 24:41.899
Mrs Pendrick gave us a list of the
buyers who coveted the Rembrandt.

24:41.899 --> 24:47.279
Thinking if they couldn't purchase
it, they would have it by whatever
means necessary. Precisely.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.899
However, we've cleared most of them.

24:49.899 --> 24:54.039
I was hoping you might have
some thoughts, given your
experience in the art world.

24:54.039 --> 24:59.059
It sounds like you are, how do you
say it, grasping the straw?

25:01.219 --> 25:04.559
I admit I seem to be quickly
running out of options.

25:04.559 --> 25:09.059
I can most certainly prepare
a list for you, but I fear the
Rembrandt already hangs elsewhere.

25:10.659 --> 25:13.579
Well, thank you for your time,
Signore Carducci.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.099
Of course.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.619
Do you like my portrait?

25:34.659 --> 25:39.059
I'll admit a certain fascination
with Mr Lightman's style.

25:40.919 --> 25:45.279
Well then, it's yours.
Just what is that?

25:45.279 --> 25:48.719
A Burtrand Lightman.
A brave choice, sir.

25:48.719 --> 25:53.759
I must say, there is something
strangely beguiling about this
new non-representational form.

25:53.759 --> 25:57.259
It's not something I would have
chosen. We should put it up.

25:57.259 --> 25:58.979
No, George. That won't be necessary.

25:58.979 --> 26:01.439
But sir, it demands it.
Better light over here.

26:01.439 --> 26:04.379
You really want to stare at
that, Murdoch?

26:04.379 --> 26:08.039
It does have merit, sir, a step
into the art of the future.

26:08.039 --> 26:11.499
Art of the future? My lad
could do better, and he's seven.

26:11.499 --> 26:13.919
Anyway, it looks upside down.

26:13.919 --> 26:17.339
I beg to differ, sir. This triangle
should be pointing upwards.

26:17.339 --> 26:21.059
Like a pyramid.
It is the pyramids, right, sir?

26:21.059 --> 26:24.079
What do you think, Murdoch, do you
know what the painting is about?

26:25.699 --> 26:29.399
The moderns believe interpretation
lies in the eye of the beholder.

26:29.399 --> 26:32.259
And just what is
your interpretation?

26:32.259 --> 26:33.699
Er...

26:35.279 --> 26:36.899
..It's a pyramid.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.139
Detective, you're needed.

26:47.379 --> 26:49.039
It's right up here, sir.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.819
Burt Lightman, the artist.

26:57.819 --> 27:01.539
The cause of death
appears the same as the robbers'.

27:01.539 --> 27:04.739
But why on earth would someone
murder a struggling artist?

27:04.739 --> 27:07.099
It would appear there's
no honour amongst thieves.

27:16.139 --> 27:20.579
There's no question, Lightman
was killed by the same weapon
used to murder the two thieves.

27:20.579 --> 27:24.119
You're quite sure? The shape of
the weapon was quite distinctive.

27:24.119 --> 27:28.219
Same weapon, eh? Sounds like another
loose end being tied up to me.

27:28.219 --> 27:30.319
Suggesting Mr Lightman
was part of the theft.

27:30.319 --> 27:33.539
But what role does a modern artist
play in the theft of an old master?

27:33.539 --> 27:35.959
Lightman despised the Old Masters.

27:35.959 --> 27:41.279
Exactly, doctor. He was more likely
to burn it in an act of public
art protest than profit from it.

27:41.279 --> 27:45.819
Perhaps. Or perhaps the man
did protest too much.

28:03.699 --> 28:05.239
Sir!

28:05.239 --> 28:10.179
Some of Lightman's work. Before
his geometric phase, I presume.

28:10.179 --> 28:13.459
Seems he was quite talented
in a classical sense.

28:18.139 --> 28:22.639
Classical?
I use only primary colours...

28:22.639 --> 28:24.499
Berries and leaves, why that?

28:24.499 --> 28:26.379
A vegetarian, perhaps?

28:26.379 --> 28:28.259
Perhaps.

28:28.259 --> 28:31.299
George, pack all of these up,
along with the sketches.

28:31.299 --> 28:32.779
Sir.

28:53.919 --> 28:58.019
What have you got there, Murdoch?
Pigments, sir. Used in making paint.

28:58.019 --> 29:01.119
I know what pigments are.
What have they to do with this case?

29:01.119 --> 29:04.859
Mr Lightman went to a great deal
of trouble to create these pigments.

29:04.859 --> 29:08.319
Perhaps he wanted special colours
for his special paintings.

29:08.319 --> 29:12.539
Yes, but Lightman only painted
in primary colours. No ochre. Mmm.

29:12.539 --> 29:14.299
Well, I admit that is interesting.

29:14.299 --> 29:18.459
What's more interesting,
this ochre colour is derived
from buckthorn berries

29:18.459 --> 29:22.239
commonly used by the Old Masters,
particularly Rembrandt.

29:22.239 --> 29:25.359
Why did Lightman want to make
the same pigment as Rembrandt?

29:25.359 --> 29:28.139
Unless he wanted to paint like him.

29:28.139 --> 29:33.839
You are correct, Detective,
this is the exact shade of ochre
Rembrandt used. Why do you ask?

29:33.839 --> 29:39.539
I believe Lightman was either
about to, or had painted,
a forgery of Bathsheba At Her Bath.

29:39.539 --> 29:42.239
That is ridiculous.

29:42.239 --> 29:46.179
To copy a Rembrandt requires skills
Signore Lightman did not possess.

29:46.179 --> 29:47.739
I believe he did.

29:47.739 --> 29:53.519
We found sketches
in Mr Lightman's studio.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.819
Clearly Mr Lightman
was classically trained.

30:01.819 --> 30:04.239
So, let us say Burtrand
did paint a forgery.

30:04.239 --> 30:08.559
What use is a worthless copy
to the thieves when they have
the priceless original?

30:08.559 --> 30:14.659
What if the theft of the Rembrandt
was staged in order to sell
an unsuspecting buyer a forgery?

30:14.659 --> 30:19.259
But any buyer would expect such a
well-known painting to be a forgery.

30:19.259 --> 30:24.599
Even if the Rembrandt had been
stolen in a sensational robbery?
Ah, I see.

30:24.599 --> 30:28.639
Then the buyer could conceive
they were purchasing the original.

30:28.639 --> 30:31.059
But what if the new owner
discovers the truth?

30:31.059 --> 30:33.259
That's the beauty of the plan.

30:33.259 --> 30:35.179
The buyer has no recourse.

30:35.179 --> 30:39.479
He has knowingly bought stolen
property and therefore cannot
report it to the authorities.

30:39.479 --> 30:42.379
Incredible.
It is brilliant in its conception.

30:42.379 --> 30:44.079
So a viable scenario then?

30:44.079 --> 30:47.459
Indeed. Good.

30:47.459 --> 30:50.179
Now all I have to do is prove it.

30:51.759 --> 30:53.819
There must be some mistake.

30:53.819 --> 30:58.719
Perhaps Burt stumbled on something
and was murdered as a result.

30:58.719 --> 31:02.319
I'm afraid the evidence points to
only one conclusion, Mrs Pendrick.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.719
I can't believe he was involved.

31:06.339 --> 31:08.099
How could he betray me like this?

31:11.139 --> 31:13.419
He was a frequent guest in my house.

31:15.439 --> 31:19.359
Do you recall him paying
much attention to the Rembrandt
when he visited?

31:19.359 --> 31:22.439
He was always free
to study my collection.

31:22.439 --> 31:26.199
Could he have had time enough
to forge it? I don't see how.

31:26.199 --> 31:29.859
The Rembrandt was on loan
to a gallery in New York
for most of the past year.

31:29.859 --> 31:33.719
It returned home shortly
before the exhibition in Toronto.

31:33.719 --> 31:40.499
I see. Thank you for your time.
I'll see myself out. Such a waste.

31:42.679 --> 31:47.059
Though we have his work
to remember him by. Yes.

31:47.059 --> 31:52.059
Who knows how much my portrait
might be worth in
a couple of years, Detective?

31:52.059 --> 31:54.319
I do hope you're enjoying it.

31:56.319 --> 32:01.679
It hangs in my office.
I can think of no higher compliment.

32:15.282 --> 32:17.222
Hello, Julia.

32:17.222 --> 32:18.762
William, there you are.

32:19.713 --> 32:21.893
I have news of the murder weapon.

32:21.893 --> 32:24.233
By mapping a cross section
of the victims' brains,

32:24.233 --> 32:29.213
I've ascertained the weapon to be
an eighth of an inch in diameter,
and approximately five inches long.

32:29.213 --> 32:31.993
Very unusual.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.273
Perhaps something like a...

32:34.273 --> 32:36.133
woodworking awl.

32:36.133 --> 32:38.873
A rather specialized murder weapon,
don't you think?

32:38.873 --> 32:43.673
Both efficient and precise when
thrust into the ear of the victim.
Indeed.

32:43.673 --> 32:47.193
Thank you. It's my pleasure.

32:49.713 --> 32:51.513
This painting... Yes.

32:51.513 --> 32:53.213
It's a Burtrand Lightman.

32:53.213 --> 32:56.433
I see. Well, it's truly shocking.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.173
What makes you say that?

32:59.173 --> 33:03.473
I believe we're looking at a woman
in a rather intimate pose.

33:03.473 --> 33:06.693
Really?
I'd concluded it was a landscape...

33:06.693 --> 33:12.313
A landscape? Perhaps inspired by the
stark beauty of the Canadian Shield.

33:12.313 --> 33:14.013
Which is very...stark.

33:15.613 --> 33:18.233
William, look again.

33:18.233 --> 33:20.433
Surely the red triangle...

33:20.433 --> 33:23.473
A pyramid. A pyramid?

33:23.473 --> 33:26.333
On the Canadian Shield?

33:26.333 --> 33:28.193
William, don't be obtuse.

33:28.193 --> 33:31.113
It's the torso of a woman.

33:31.113 --> 33:33.593
Sir?
I have that information you wanted.

33:33.593 --> 33:36.913
Ah. I must be getting back.

33:36.913 --> 33:40.373
I'll leave you to enjoy
your "landscape".

33:40.373 --> 33:43.333
George. What did you find out
about Mr Lightman?

33:43.333 --> 33:47.213
As you know,
the Rembrandt spent eight months
of last year in New York.

33:47.213 --> 33:49.433
Funnily enough,
so did Burtrand Lightman.

33:49.433 --> 33:53.913
Did he now? He secured a position
at the very gallery that
was displaying the Rembrandt.

33:53.913 --> 33:55.973
Really? Night watchman.

33:55.973 --> 34:00.933
So, Mr Lightman goes to New York,
paints the forgery. Our mastermind
has already lined up a buyer.

34:00.933 --> 34:04.113
The grand theft is staged in Toronto.
And once the forgery is painted,

34:04.113 --> 34:07.153
Mr Lightman is no longer needed
by the mastermind. He's killed.

34:07.153 --> 34:10.733
But then, sir, if Lightman
created the forgery in New York,

34:10.733 --> 34:13.533
why are the supplies to make
the pigments here in Toronto?

34:14.993 --> 34:16.612
A very good question, George.

34:16.612 --> 34:19.632
Well then, also,
how did the mastermind

34:19.632 --> 34:22.993
plan on getting the painting
out of Toronto to the buyer?

34:26.632 --> 34:30.233
Are you leaving us, Burt?
I'm going to Paris. How marvellous.

34:31.632 --> 34:34.993
George, I'll need you to
pay a visit to the docks.

34:34.993 --> 34:38.132
You found no baggage listed
under Burtrand Lightman's name?

34:38.132 --> 34:40.112
There was nothing
in the manifest, sir.

34:40.112 --> 34:43.333
Lightman would have transported
the forgery with him to Paris.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.053
Perhaps the painting
was to go on a later passage?

34:46.053 --> 34:48.273
No, he wouldn't risk it
being lost in transit.

34:48.273 --> 34:50.152
We're missing something here.

34:50.152 --> 34:54.112
Sir, by all means,
have a look for yourself.

34:54.112 --> 34:56.533
His name is not on the manifest, sir.

34:58.153 --> 35:00.933
No. But we should see
what Miss Hendrickje Stoffels

35:00.933 --> 35:03.593
is shipping more than two centuries
after her death.

35:05.793 --> 35:09.613
Hendrickje who? Hendrickje Stoffels.

35:09.613 --> 35:12.433
Rembrandt's mistress,
and model of many years.

35:12.433 --> 35:15.293
So, now we're an art historian,
are we?

35:15.293 --> 35:17.553
The Bathsheba.

35:17.553 --> 35:19.353
An excellent copy.

35:19.353 --> 35:21.273
Sir?

35:21.273 --> 35:23.613
It appears she has a twin sister.

35:23.613 --> 35:26.553
The lad's been a busy boy.

35:26.553 --> 35:28.473
These are quite remarkable.

35:28.473 --> 35:31.173
Mr Lightman certainly was brazen.

35:31.173 --> 35:35.113
Why sell one forgery
when you can move...five?

35:35.993 --> 35:37.593
Four, George.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.353
Four, sir?

35:39.353 --> 35:41.033
Murdoch, there are five.

35:41.033 --> 35:43.993
Yes, but only four are copies.

35:43.993 --> 35:47.293
I believe this one
is the original Rembrandt.

36:49.213 --> 36:52.433
Are you sure this is the original?
Because they all look alike to me.

36:52.433 --> 36:55.233
Many painters
have a signature technique.

36:55.233 --> 36:59.613
Rembrandt used a single layer
of coarsely-sieved quartz
as a canvas primer.

36:59.613 --> 37:03.013
I've examined the medium
used on this canvas,
and it is indeed quartz.

37:03.013 --> 37:05.733
Proving what?
This is Canada, Murdoch.

37:05.733 --> 37:08.973
You can't go anywhere without
tripping over bloody quartz.

37:08.973 --> 37:12.433
Not this type. However,
it is commonly found in Holland.

37:12.433 --> 37:16.753
There is no question,
this is the Rembrandt.

37:16.753 --> 37:19.213
Think of it, sir.

37:19.213 --> 37:24.513
We are standing here, just as
he did, assessing his masterpiece

37:24.513 --> 37:28.733
to pronounce it done and perfect.

37:32.313 --> 37:37.553
Sir? Thousands of dollars
for some bare-arsed floozy
having her feet washed.

37:37.553 --> 37:39.173
How did Lightman get it?

37:39.173 --> 37:42.913
He had unfettered access
to the Pendrick collection.

37:42.913 --> 37:49.113
I believe he switched the original
for a forgery he made in New York
on one such occasion.

37:49.113 --> 37:53.853
So the painting exhibited at
the Pendrick Building, stolen by
the thieves, was a forgery.

37:53.853 --> 37:56.093
So it would seem.

37:56.093 --> 37:57.833
The sneaky little sod.

37:57.833 --> 38:01.773
Do you think Lightman
took it to sell himself? Perhaps.

38:01.773 --> 38:05.053
But he didn't account for the
treachery of his partner in crime.

38:05.053 --> 38:09.433
Who killed him before he realized
Lightman had the original. Exactly.

38:09.433 --> 38:11.273
So who's behind it all, Murdoch?

38:12.673 --> 38:16.993
For the swindle to work,
the buyers must believe they
are purchasing the original.

38:16.993 --> 38:22.253
So the original can't resurface
until the forgeries
have been delivered. Correct.

38:22.253 --> 38:27.333
I believe it's time for Bathsheba
to return to her rightful owner.

38:32.753 --> 38:35.493
You have exceeded my expectations,
Detective.

38:35.493 --> 38:38.653
My wife will be delighted to see the
Rembrandt within these walls again.

38:38.653 --> 38:42.633
Before you speak to her,
I have invited Signore Carducci
to authenticate the painting.

38:42.633 --> 38:46.393
A mere formality. Detective,
no-one can replicate the master.

38:46.393 --> 38:51.293
Agree, but I would feel more
assured we have the original
if you would take a closer look.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.753
I cannot believe the audacity.

38:57.693 --> 38:59.253
Is something wrong?

38:59.253 --> 39:02.353
This is a forgery.
An excellent one, but...

39:02.353 --> 39:04.573
Are you absolutely sure?
Look at the eyes.

39:04.573 --> 39:06.953
The window to Bathsheba's soul.

39:06.953 --> 39:10.513
The forger cannot capture
Rembrandt's depth of emotion.

39:10.513 --> 39:13.193
But I don't understand...

39:13.193 --> 39:17.353
This,
this is surely as great a crime.

39:17.353 --> 39:20.593
To have her back once more
only to see her taken away.

39:20.593 --> 39:23.833
I am terribly sorry to have raised
your hopes, sir. It is late.

39:23.833 --> 39:26.333
I have a pressing engagement.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.113
Good evening, gentlemen.

39:33.573 --> 39:38.993
It's all right, Detective. If it
weren't for Signore Carducci, I too
would have judged this the original.

39:38.993 --> 39:41.613
Interesting you should say that.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.633
Please excuse me,
there is a matter I must attend to.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.133
Yes, of course.

40:05.353 --> 40:08.413
Mannaggia!

40:08.413 --> 40:10.393
So that's where you hid it.

40:11.433 --> 40:15.473
Detective... I, uh...
You what? Can explain?

40:15.473 --> 40:18.193
I doubt that very much, Mr Carducci.

40:18.193 --> 40:22.053
I just watched you declare
the real Rembrandt a forgery.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.753
There was only one reason
to do that.

40:24.753 --> 40:29.593
To maintain the swindle
you'd orchestrated. I admit nothing.

40:29.593 --> 40:33.953
Except perhaps
going to a great deal of trouble
to steal a worthless fake.

40:33.953 --> 40:38.413
Burt Lightman exchanged the
Rembrandt for one of his forgeries
while it was in the Pendrick home.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.960
You, sir,
are a thief and a murderer.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.820
But to orchestrate this
you had help.

40:52.420 --> 40:55.980
Where did you get
the inside information you needed?

40:55.980 --> 40:58.620
The building plans,
the movement of the painting?

40:58.620 --> 41:00.380
Someone else had a hand in this.

41:00.380 --> 41:03.180
Who was it?

41:03.180 --> 41:04.860
Who are you working for?

41:13.760 --> 41:18.220
As you already know, Detective, I am
a professional who abhors loose ends.

41:20.340 --> 41:22.540
GUNSHOT

41:36.160 --> 41:38.380
A rather clever design,
don't you think?

41:38.380 --> 41:41.580
Carducci used this to kill
the two thieves and Lightman.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.320
And almost you as well, sir.

41:43.320 --> 41:45.960
Thank goodness Mr Pendrick
arrived when he did.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.380
Quite impeccable timing on his part.
What do you mean?

41:49.380 --> 41:52.780
There are pieces of this puzzle
Carducci took to the grave.

41:52.780 --> 41:56.480
Like what? How did he know
the exact movements of the painting?

41:56.480 --> 42:00.840
How did he orchestrate
the complex theft without
detailed inside information?

42:00.840 --> 42:03.400
His hired guns
were disguised as caterers.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.940
He had access to the building
days in advance.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.940
But consider this.

42:07.940 --> 42:11.080
Once forgeries are delivered
and the money is collected,

42:11.080 --> 42:15.260
the original mysteriously reappears,
only one man benefits.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.860
Pendrick? He'd have his money
and his original,
and no-one would suspect him.

42:21.860 --> 42:24.500
You've caught the killer,
found the Rembrandt...

42:24.500 --> 42:28.280
And prevented one of the biggest
art frauds in history.
Excellent point, Doctor.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.940
Isn't that enough for you, Murdoch?

42:34.520 --> 42:37.340
I will miss her.

42:37.340 --> 42:43.400
But after such a dreadful turn
of events, I couldn't bear to have
the painting in the house any more.

42:43.400 --> 42:46.200
I have persuaded James
to donate her to the Louvre. Oh.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.840
That's very philanthropic of you.

42:48.840 --> 42:51.780
But you will be needing
a replacement, Mrs Pendrick.

42:51.780 --> 42:54.300
Might I suggest your
Burt Lightman portrait?

42:54.300 --> 42:57.700
Really? You would part with it?

42:57.700 --> 43:01.760
It would offer a refreshing modern
perspective to your collection.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.660
That's very observant of you,
Detective.

43:04.660 --> 43:09.300
I accept your offer,
but I trust you will come
and visit it from time to time?

43:09.300 --> 43:11.260
It would be my pleasure.

43:11.260 --> 43:15.840
Detective Murdoch. Congratulations.
Things couldn't have
turned out better.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.560
Mr Pendrick. I believe
some of the credit goes to you.

43:18.560 --> 43:22.460
I would not be here today were it
not for your timely intervention.

43:22.460 --> 43:24.920
Pure luck, I assure you.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.840
Tell me, what brought you
to the building last night?

43:27.840 --> 43:31.560
I often go up there to look at
the night sky. Really?

43:31.560 --> 43:35.300
What's the point of owning
the tallest building in Toronto

43:35.300 --> 43:37.720
if you don't avail yourself
of its advantages?

43:38.940 --> 43:40.780
And the gun?

43:42.220 --> 43:44.600
I never venture out at night
without a firearm.

43:47.020 --> 43:49.140
Detective, you seem unsettled.

43:50.980 --> 43:55.140
In an odd way, Signore Carducci
and I are very similar.

43:55.140 --> 43:59.420
We both dislike loose ends.
Loose ends?

43:59.420 --> 44:05.100
With Signore Carducci dead,
we'll never be able to ascertain
the identity of his employer.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.140
The true mastermind
behind this crime.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.940
And what makes you think
he wasn't the true mastermind?

44:12.700 --> 44:14.900
It's a theory. For now.

44:14.900 --> 44:17.020
Mrs Pendrick, Mr Pendrick.

44:17.020 --> 44:19.060
I bid you good day.

44:19.060 --> 44:21.160
Good day, Detective Murdoch.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.860
I trust our paths will cross again.

44:24.860 --> 44:27.800
I will look forward to that.
