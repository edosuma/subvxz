02:09.720 --> 02:13.463
(SHAKILY) No. No, no, no.
No, I'm not your father, Jack.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.919
It is Jack, right?

02:19.560 --> 02:20.549

04:59.440 --> 05:02.785
Can I interest you in a Cheesebutt?
Or maybe a Salty Butt Combo.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.502
Or perhaps my favorite.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.747
Oh, come on.
He's fired me, like, seven times.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.543
And I keep coming back. You know why?

05:15.280 --> 05:16.907
Because Dave's banging your mom?

05:17.040 --> 05:18.029
Exactly.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.104
Let's face it, buddy.
Around here, I'm untouchable.

We still have holy oil, right?

06:17.560 --> 06:18.549
For what?

06:20.120 --> 06:21.826
'Cause we're gonna have to hit him
with everything we got.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.149
Hold on a second.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.820
Can we just talk about
what happened back there?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.109
Sure. Which part?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.622
Let's see, Crowley's dead,
Kelly's dead, Cass is...

06:33.200 --> 06:35.020
Mom's gone, and apparently,
the Devil's kid

06:35.120 --> 06:38.100
hit puberty in 30 seconds flat.
Oh, and almost killed us.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.417
Yeah, because you tried to shoot him.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.580
I tried to shoot the monster, Sam.
That's kind of what we do.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.180
We don't know what he is yet, Dean.
And I had it under control.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.941
I'm sorry. Are you defending
the son of Satan?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.463
I'm not defending anything.
I'm just saying, look,

06:49.720 --> 06:52.029
with everything that's happened,
I'm obviously spun out also,

06:52.120 --> 06:53.303
but we need a plan.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.107
Yeah, kill him. Okay? That's the plan.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.506
Look, right now,
all that matters is finding him

06:58.640 --> 07:01.097
and ending him
before he hurts anybody else.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.266
And once we do that,
we'll figure everything else out.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.709
What about Cass?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.109
Is he...

07:11.720 --> 07:13.620
- Is he really dead?
- You know he is.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.179
Uh, hi.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.109
Easy. Easy now.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.040
I’m just... My name’s Cnn'sune Barker.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.269
I'm a sheriff.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.799
I'm just here to help, okay?

07:54.360 --> 07:55.349
Okay?

08:23.600 --> 08:24.862
- Is that--
- Castiel.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.422
A/ways knew he’d meet a bad end.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.023
- He deserved better.
- No, he really didn't.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.422
- The mother's upstairs, but she's--
- I don't care about the brood mare.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.269
Where's the child?

08:38.720 --> 08:39.709
Gone.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.149
Of course he is.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.709
So weird.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.065
Why don't you head out on patrol, Earl?

09:01.040 --> 09:04.385
And by the way,
there's no such thing as weird.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.946
- Everyone's normal in their own way.
- Right.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.628
- Sorry, Sheriff.
- Yeah.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.549
Totally normal.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.749
Hope those are all right.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.861
Just pulled some stuff
from the lost and found.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.309
Take a seat.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.389
Sit.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.024
Okay. Let's start with the basics.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.429

09:43.880 --> 09:44.869
What's your name?

09:48.920 --> 09:49.909

09:50.480 --> 09:53.347
Okay, Jack. Jack what?

09:56.360 --> 09:57.384
What's your last name?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.503
Okay, how 'bout...

10:05.440 --> 10:08.546
Where are your parents?
Your mother and father?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.860
My mother, she's in Heaven.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.589
My father...

10:17.560 --> 10:19.187
He was supposed to be here,

10:19.840 --> 10:21.159
but he's not.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.421
I'm trying to find him.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.587
I have to find him.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.224
Sure. We can do that.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.109
What's his phone number?

10:37.880 --> 10:40.587
What about his address? Or an e-mail?

10:44.240 --> 10:46.026
Is there anything you do remember, Jack?

10:48.680 --> 10:49.783

10:50.360 --> 10:52.624

I'm gonna take your thumbprint,

11:09.960 --> 11:12.064
and we're gonna
run it through the system.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.269
If we get a match,

11:13.840 --> 11:14.829
we get you home, yeah?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.626
Okay, just like that.

11:18.840 --> 11:19.943
And press it here.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.144
Okay.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.259
You stay here. I'll be right back.

Dude.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.981
How high are you?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.419
I don't know what that means.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.417
Well, it means, like, wasted, lit,

11:49.280 --> 11:54.058
chonged, blitzed, blasted, blazed,
baked. Nothing, no? Look,

11:54.960 --> 11:57.520
I'm not judging you. I'm jealous.

No, I'm not stoned.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.029

What?

I'm hungry-

12:40.720 --> 12:41.709
Well...

12:43.360 --> 12:46.989
You really think that Lucifer Jr.
is at Pirate Pete's Jolly Treats?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.140
That he was, like, what,
"Before I destroy the world,

12:49.240 --> 12:50.901
"let me just
grab a bag of a curly fries"?

12:51.080 --> 12:52.217
Look, if he would've kept to
the main road,

12:52.320 --> 12:53.639
he would've walked past it.
And I don't know--

12:53.720 --> 12:55.108
Fine. Just make it quick.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.464
- You're not coming?
- No.

Look, maybe you're right.
Maybe the Devil's kid

13:00.520 --> 13:01.839
is in there just hanging out. Okay?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.297
Or maybe he's halfway
across the country, torching Chicago.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.377

24:45.640 --> 24:47.028
he would keep me safe.

a dangerous place. That's...

40:33.600 --> 40:34.589
Hey.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.320
So, you thought you could run away

40:40.520 --> 40:41.509
from me?

40:42.280 --> 40:43.269
Really?

40:46.040 --> 40:47.029
Really?

40:47.400 --> 40:48.583
You do know I can fly, right?

40:50.440 --> 40:51.429
So what now?

40:53.920 --> 40:54.909
You kill me?

40:57.080 --> 40:58.069
Sure.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.302
Or maybe not.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.509
Maybe...

41:09.440 --> 41:10.577
Maybe I need you.
