'cause l raised you
your whole life.

around and tells me

that he's gonna
marry my daughter

1:06:21.603 --> 1:06:23.646

to Timbuktu.

and not bring in
a paycheck.

his own weight?

tell him tomorrow.
l promise.

like your new buddy Brad

the clubs all night long,

1:07:26.876 --> 1:07:28.919

the young girls?

l forgot Valentine's Day
and l'm really sorry.

my daughters
made fun of me.

1:07:41.474 --> 1:07:42.725

l was listening

1:07:44.102 --> 1:07:47.146
and they made fun
of the woman l've become.

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:49.064
They're our children.
That's what they do.

1:07:49.149 --> 1:07:51.859
No, no, no.
l used to be
a cool chick.

1:07:51.943 --> 1:07:54.236
l was fun.
Don't you miss that?

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:55.612

l know we're not
kids anymore, Miguel.

1:07:58.658 --> 1:08:00.784
But when did l
stop being a woman?

1:08:00.869 --> 1:08:02.703
l'm a wife,
l'm a mother.

1:08:03.371 --> 1:08:05.330
But you don't
see me as that girl

1:08:05.415 --> 1:08:07.791
that you used to
pick up in your ride.

1:08:08.626 --> 1:08:12.504
And we would just drive
with the top down.

1:08:14.382 --> 1:08:19.845
Then we'd park
and listen to
music all night,

1:08:20.722 --> 1:08:22.514
till the sun came up.

1:08:22.599 --> 1:08:26.101
But we can't do that anymore
'cause l gotta go to work.

Why is it when
l asked you the other day
how l looked,

1:08:30.815 --> 1:08:32.357
you said, "Fine,"

1:08:33.026 --> 1:08:36.820
but whatever car
you're working on
looks sexy?

1:08:45.497 --> 1:08:47.331
l dropped out of law school
to be a volunteer teacher.

1:08:47.415 --> 1:08:51.251
We think that's noble.
He's not going to.
lt's gonna kill him.

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:56.298
Baby, he was drunk
and pouring his heart out.

1:08:56.382 --> 1:08:57.633
What was l supposed to do?

1:08:57.717 --> 1:08:59.343
Stand up for me.

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:06.517

and watched as l drowned
to save yourself.

disappointment.

1:09:15.068 --> 1:09:16.985

about my mother.

tell me you love me,

1:09:21.032 --> 1:09:22.491
l need to be
able to trust that.

1:09:22.575 --> 1:09:23.784
When you say
you'll never leave me,

1:09:23.868 --> 1:09:26.745
l need to be
able to believe it.

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:30.123
lf you can't
stand up to your dad

1:09:30.208 --> 1:09:31.750
for our relationship,
for me,

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:35.462
then what are we doing?
Why are we doing this?

to do this?

to get married?

make it easy for you.

1:39:47.148 --> 1:39:50.859
Ba de ya
Dancing in September

1:39:50.943 --> 1:39:55.489
Ba de ya
Golden dreams
were shiny days

1:39:58.785 --> 1:40:01.620
The beIIs were ringing

1:40:01.704 --> 1:40:06.333
Oh, our souls were singing

1:40:06.417 --> 1:40:10.671
Do you remember?
Never a cIoudy day

1:40:13.216 --> 1:40:17.386
There wasn't... Ba de ya
Say, do you remember?

1:40:17.470 --> 1:40:21.181
Ba de ya
Dancing in September

1:40:21.265 --> 1:40:25.310
Ba de ya
Golden dreams
were shiny days

1:40:58.636 --> 1:41:02.472
Soft lips glistening
Got me listening
to your every word

1:41:02.557 --> 1:41:04.349
Though I don't speak
a word of Spanish

1:41:04.434 --> 1:41:06.476
l can see
the Ianguage barrier
beginning to bIur

1:41:06.561 --> 1:41:09.563
Got to have it
Though you're not
an item to be won

1:41:09.647 --> 1:41:11.898
But a dream too lavish
to be sIept on

1:41:11.983 --> 1:41:13.734
So l uncock my weapon

1:41:13.818 --> 1:41:16.111
And step unharmed
to your feminine charms

1:41:16.195 --> 1:41:18.196
Take a chance
and ask you
to dance with me

1:41:18.281 --> 1:41:21.366
Though some say
I got two Ieft feet
I stiII gIide to the beat

1:41:21.451 --> 1:41:22.993
Sliding with thee
in motion

1:41:23.077 --> 1:41:24.745
Overdosing from
the opuIent potion

1:41:24.829 --> 1:41:26.455
Emotion crashing
like the ocean

1:41:26.539 --> 1:41:27.748
Tide rising, spIashing

1:41:27.832 --> 1:41:30.333
Our silhouettes enclosing
in the passion
Heart dashing

1:41:30.418 --> 1:41:33.003
Souls lock, sweat glistening
Yeah

1:41:33.087 --> 1:41:35.130
Let your eyes
do the taIking
I'm Iistening

1:41:35.214 --> 1:41:38.425
On this hot Spanish night

1:41:38.509 --> 1:41:41.887
Your eyes are
Iike candIeIight

1:41:43.139 --> 1:41:48.018
I wonder, wouId it be
aII right with you

1:41:48.102 --> 1:41:53.106
if we couId fIy away
to the moon

1:41:53.191 --> 1:41:55.776
Hot like the
pimientos de Padrόn pepper

1:41:55.860 --> 1:41:57.736
Sweet like churros
but way better

1:41:57.820 --> 1:42:00.697
Let the worId go
Let's toast
to full-bodied red wine

1:42:00.782 --> 1:42:03.658
Sip it slow
and let it breathe
as the perfume unwinds

1:42:03.743 --> 1:42:05.702
Grapes plucked
from a vintage vine

1:42:05.787 --> 1:42:08.121
Got me sinking deep
into your intense eyes

1:42:08.206 --> 1:42:10.957
Let the incense rising
cause an effect
BIood rushing

1:42:11.042 --> 1:42:12.626
AII right,
Iet me pause
for a sec

1:42:12.710 --> 1:42:15.128
l'm combusted
and l don't want to
faII in my step

1:42:15.213 --> 1:42:17.589
Entrusting you
Got all my respect

1:42:17.673 --> 1:42:19.591
Call me collect
My phone's on roam

1:42:19.675 --> 1:42:22.385
I Iove your breath in my ear
and your vocaI tone

1:42:22.595 --> 1:42:25.180
Hot Spanish night

1:42:25.598 --> 1:42:29.267
Your eyes are
Iike candIeIight

1:42:30.311 --> 1:42:34.022
I wonder, wouId it be
aII right with you

1:42:35.399 --> 1:42:39.945
if we couId fIy away
to the moon

1:42:41.239 --> 1:42:44.282
Hot Spanish night

1:42:44.367 --> 1:42:48.078
Your eyes are
Iike candIeIight

1:42:49.163 --> 1:42:54.000
I wonder, wouId it be
aII right with you

1:42:54.252 --> 1:42:59.214
if we couId fIy away
to the moon

1:42:59.423 --> 1:43:20.423
