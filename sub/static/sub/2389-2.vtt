NARRATOR: <i>Kids, Barney and Robin's</i>
<i>wedding turned out</i>

00:08.247 --> 00:10.614
<i>to be a life-changing weekend</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>

00:10.616 --> 00:12.466
<i>Well, not just us.</i>

00:12.468 --> 00:14.201
One ticket to Farhampton,
please.

00:14.203 --> 00:16.003
NARRATOR:
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

00:16.004 --> 00:17.338
(horn honks)

00:17.340 --> 00:19.723
Who are you honking at?
You.

00:19.725 --> 00:21.675
You're going 40 in a 65.

00:21.677 --> 00:23.794
Pick it up, Grandma!

00:23.796 --> 00:25.846
Look, I'm happy to rock it up
into the 50s,

00:25.848 --> 00:29.566
but I'm gonna need a hand...
or two.

00:29.568 --> 00:31.719
Oh, no. Not the driving gloves.

00:31.721 --> 00:33.387
In 99.9% of highway accidents,

00:33.389 --> 00:35.723
the driver was not
wearing gloves.

00:35.725 --> 00:36.774
Because they're stupid.

00:36.776 --> 00:38.475
They don't help you
drive better.

00:38.477 --> 00:40.144
That's why no one wears them.

00:40.146 --> 00:43.430
Then why is it called...
the glove compartment?

00:43.432 --> 00:45.532
I am not
having this argument again.

00:45.534 --> 00:48.435
Now, as you know, a Mosby
road trip is not only safe,

00:48.437 --> 00:49.386
but informative.

00:49.388 --> 00:51.522
Chiggedy-check it.

00:51.524 --> 00:53.490
<i>Manhattan to Farhampton:</i>

00:53.492 --> 00:56.910
<i>Lil' and Ted's</i>

00:56.912 --> 00:58.746
That baby's stuffed to the rings
with fun facts

00:58.748 --> 01:01.048
about our unsung neighbor
to the east-- Long Island.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.467
For instance, just up
ahead, the historic

01:03.469 --> 01:05.669
childhood home of
Florian van Otterloop,

01:05.671 --> 01:06.887
the Dutch bucklesmith

01:06.889 --> 01:08.889
who revolutionized
the belt industry.

01:08.891 --> 01:10.924
Uh, fun story
about that color-blind genius.

01:10.926 --> 01:12.459
When he...
Please stop!

01:12.461 --> 01:15.062
Well, I was just gonna
slow down for pictures,

01:15.064 --> 01:18.399
but that level of enthusiasm
can't go unrewarded.

Hmm.

01:37.119 --> 01:39.503
Oh, look at my
little cousins

01:39.505 --> 01:41.355
in their flower
girl dresses.

01:41.357 --> 01:43.691
Aw, they'll look so cute
next to the ring bear.

01:43.693 --> 01:44.842
Yeah.

01:44.844 --> 01:48.128
Wait, you said
ring <i>bear-er,</i> right?

01:48.130 --> 01:49.963
Ring bear.

01:49.965 --> 01:51.582
Ring <i>bear-er.</i>

01:51.584 --> 01:53.333
Ring bear.

01:53.335 --> 01:55.469
Are you planning
some crazy stunt

01:55.471 --> 01:57.971
with a dangerous wild animal
at our wedding?

01:57.973 --> 01:59.189
(phone chirps)
Because...

01:59.191 --> 02:00.724
Oh, oh, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:00.726 --> 02:02.059
Oh, boy.

02:02.061 --> 02:03.227
My brother wants to know

02:03.229 --> 02:05.779
what time he "goes on"
at the reception.

02:05.781 --> 02:07.114
What does that mean?

02:07.116 --> 02:11.435
Every wedding he attends,
James insists on... performing.

Everybody loves

02:36.095 --> 02:39.079
I have invited Scherbatskys
from all over Canada,

02:39.081 --> 02:40.514
and they are Canuckin' nuts.

02:40.516 --> 02:42.850
Like my cousin Ruth
from the Yukon.

02:42.852 --> 02:45.352
I don't like to encourage
Canadian stereotypes,

02:45.354 --> 02:48.605
but that woman
practically rides a moose.

02:48.607 --> 02:50.223
(laughs)

02:50.225 --> 02:51.658
Does she actually ride a moose?

02:51.660 --> 02:52.693
Yeah.

02:52.695 --> 02:54.111
And, uh,

02:54.113 --> 02:56.313
I'm worried she'll bring it
to the wedding.

02:56.315 --> 03:00.334
She and the moose are...
very close.

03:01.386 --> 03:03.103
Whoa.

03:03.105 --> 03:06.490
Every wedding's got a wild card,
but we've invited a whole set.

03:06.492 --> 03:08.792
(accordion playing
"Wedding March")

03:15.233 --> 03:17.367
Someone is gonna
ruin this wedding.

03:17.369 --> 03:21.371
It's just a question
of... who.

03:21.373 --> 03:24.124
I'm gonna ruin this wedding!

03:24.126 --> 03:25.642
My wife is
gonna kill me!

03:25.644 --> 03:27.761
PILOT: Flight attendants
prepare for departure.

03:27.763 --> 03:30.164
We were gonna move to
Italy for her dream job,

03:30.166 --> 03:32.432
so I brought my son
here to Minnesota

03:32.434 --> 03:34.935
to see my mom
before we left.

03:36.404 --> 03:38.806
And then I got offered
a job as a judge

03:38.808 --> 03:41.325
in New York City,
which is my dream.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.211
But that'll totally
destroy her dream!

03:44.213 --> 03:46.747
You are destroying
a lot of dreams right now.

03:47.966 --> 03:50.167
(phone chimes)

03:54.272 --> 03:56.974
(chuckles)

03:56.976 --> 03:59.092
Wait.

03:59.094 --> 04:01.261
If I got this...

04:03.631 --> 04:05.766
(phone chimes)

04:07.519 --> 04:08.852
(sighs)

04:08.854 --> 04:10.070
Aren't you gonna
check that?

04:10.072 --> 04:11.572
No.

04:11.574 --> 04:13.640
It-It's just another
obnoxious update

04:13.642 --> 04:14.658
from Marshall's mom.

04:14.660 --> 04:15.659
She's been posting

04:15.661 --> 04:18.327
these "cute" baby pics
of Marvin,

04:18.329 --> 04:20.831
but it's all just propaganda.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.833
First, it was
"Don't move to Italy."

04:23.868 --> 04:26.303
Followed by an extremely subtle
<i>guilt trip.</i>

04:29.040 --> 04:32.075
<i>And then, randomly preachy.</i>

04:32.077 --> 04:33.427
Nah, not looking.

04:33.429 --> 04:34.978
It's just gonna piss me off.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.713
Why are we exiting again?

04:36.715 --> 04:38.048
Well, if you turn in your binder

04:38.050 --> 04:39.850
to the section labeled
"Mennonite Windmills..."

04:39.852 --> 04:41.301
Get back on the expressway now.

04:41.303 --> 04:42.352
(scoffs)

04:42.354 --> 04:45.105
The expressway's
for gloveless amateurs.

04:45.107 --> 04:46.390
I'm done.

04:46.392 --> 04:48.041
There's a train station
coming up; just drop me off.

04:48.043 --> 04:50.193
Okay, but some newfangled
train's not gonna stop

04:50.195 --> 04:52.429
at the 40-foot-tall
butter churn in Ronkonkoma!

04:52.431 --> 04:55.849
Yes, but unlike any of
your 18th-century stops,

04:55.851 --> 04:59.185
at least the train will have
a 21st-century toilet!

04:59.187 --> 05:00.821
You're a 21st-century toilet!

05:00.823 --> 05:01.822
(gasps)

05:01.824 --> 05:02.789
Train now!

05:02.791 --> 05:04.625
Fine!

05:04.627 --> 05:07.711
Okay, so far,
I've got 12 wild cards,

05:07.713 --> 05:09.029
not counting the ring bear.

05:09.031 --> 05:10.130
Ring bear-er.

05:10.132 --> 05:11.448
Oh, oh, here's another one.

05:11.450 --> 05:13.867
You know how I found out
that I'm one-quarter Canadian

05:13.869 --> 05:15.218
but I've completely
blocked that out

05:15.220 --> 05:16.820
because your nation's ridiculous
and I'm awesome?

05:16.822 --> 05:17.888
Sure.

05:17.890 --> 05:20.040
Well, turns out,
I have a crazy cousin Mitch

05:20.042 --> 05:21.391
on that side of the family.

05:21.393 --> 05:22.342
That's funny.

05:22.344 --> 05:24.044
I have a crazy
cousin Mitch, too.

05:24.046 --> 05:26.013
But I guarantee
he is crazier than yours.

05:26.015 --> 05:28.515
He built his own house
from timber he chopped down

05:28.517 --> 05:30.150
from other people's houses.

05:30.152 --> 05:31.602
That's funny.

05:31.604 --> 05:33.270
My cousin Mitch
is a lumberjack.

05:33.272 --> 05:35.906
Except mine has six fingers.

05:35.908 --> 05:37.157
On one hand or total?

05:37.159 --> 05:38.525
Total.

05:39.327 --> 05:41.311
Are truckers always
beating him up?

05:41.313 --> 05:43.196
Yes, because he has to...

05:43.198 --> 05:44.331
BOTH: ...hitchhike
with his middle finger.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.984
Wait.

05:46.986 --> 05:49.586
Is it possible that we're...

05:51.405 --> 05:54.625
Could... c-could...
could we be...?

05:54.627 --> 05:56.126
Shh...

05:58.930 --> 06:01.598
Ranjit, could you be a dear
and pull over for a second?

06:01.600 --> 06:04.250
Pulling over!

06:04.252 --> 06:06.436
(both chuckle weakly)

06:09.140 --> 06:11.191
(both retching)

06:11.193 --> 06:12.809
All right, train.

06:12.811 --> 06:16.029
Let's show your critics you're
not just a Dumpster on wheels

06:16.031 --> 06:17.597
full of drunk idiots.

06:17.599 --> 06:19.883
CONDUCTOR:
We're being held at this station

06:19.885 --> 06:21.351
until further notice.

06:21.353 --> 06:23.570
I got to sober up.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.074

06:35.012 --> 06:37.178
Eriksen residence,
Judy speaking.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.730
Why did you post
that judge photo?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.315
Because I'm guilty...

06:40.317 --> 06:43.468
of being one proud mama!

06:43.470 --> 06:45.186
Lily doesn't know
that I took the job,

06:45.188 --> 06:46.821
so if she sees it,
I'm dead.

06:46.823 --> 06:47.922
Just take it down, okay?

06:47.924 --> 06:48.957
Fine.

06:48.959 --> 06:51.543
Let me just get on the online

06:51.545 --> 06:52.977
so I can Internet.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.580
I love the lingo!

06:55.582 --> 06:57.549
(modem screeching)

06:57.551 --> 06:59.117
Look, Mom,
just-just...

06:59.119 --> 07:01.002
click on the photo
on your wall,

07:01.004 --> 07:03.872
and then under "menu""
click on "options""

07:03.874 --> 07:06.374
Some kind of advertisement
popped on.

07:06.376 --> 07:07.842
Oh, my.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.462
That appears to be pornography.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.564
Just click
on "options""

07:12.566 --> 07:15.100
(whispering):
It's men with other men.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.267
(whispering loudly):
Just click on "options"!

07:16.269 --> 07:17.335
Excuse me!

07:17.337 --> 07:19.120
Are there any other seats
left on this plane?

07:19.122 --> 07:20.121
No.

07:20.123 --> 07:21.389
Hell, I've been
going to Pilates.

07:21.391 --> 07:23.525
I can just hang on
to the landing gear like this.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.542
Sorry, ma'am.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.528
I only signed up for Pilates,

07:26.530 --> 07:29.197
I haven't actually
started going yet.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.282
I didn't sign up.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.536
LILY:
<i>No, I'm not looking.</i>

07:34.538 --> 07:37.572
<i>I don't need to see</i>
<i>my child used against me.</i>

07:37.574 --> 07:41.543
<i>My sweet, beautiful child</i>
<i>who I haven't seen in a week...</i>

07:41.545 --> 07:45.296
<i>whose head smells like love</i>
<i>and unicorn teardrops,</i>

07:45.298 --> 07:47.365
<i>and why are trains</i>
<i>so lonely?!</i>

07:47.367 --> 07:48.383
<i>Damn it, I'm looking!</i>

07:48.385 --> 07:49.667
WOMAN:
Hey, are you okay?

07:49.669 --> 07:51.386
You look stressed.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.470
Plus, you muttered

07:52.472 --> 07:53.721
a few words out loud.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.706
I heard "lonely" and "unicorn,"

07:55.708 --> 07:57.342
which actually gave me
a great idea

07:57.344 --> 07:59.877
for a children's book,
so thank you.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.546
Are you okay?

08:01.548 --> 08:03.064
No.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.983
But there's nothing you can do.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.067
Do you want a cookie?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.718
(crying):
Yes.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.903
Yes, I do.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.155
Wow.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.356
You just took a cookie

08:11.358 --> 08:12.991
from a complete stranger
on a train.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.192
I like how trusting you are.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.161
There could be drugs
or poison in there.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.812
But there's not, is there?

08:17.814 --> 08:19.230
No idea,
I found them under my seat.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.448
No!

08:20.450 --> 08:21.749
Kidding! Sorry!

08:21.751 --> 08:23.952
You looked stressed, so I
thought you could use a cookie,

08:23.954 --> 08:25.587
then I thought
you could use a joke.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.255
I should have stopped
at the cookie.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.289
You know what?

08:28.291 --> 08:30.208
I don't care
if these are poisoned.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.843
There's chocolate
and peanut butter

08:31.845 --> 08:33.510
and caramel in these sumbitches.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.913
I call them "Sumbitches"!

08:35.914 --> 08:36.931
(laughing)

08:36.933 --> 08:38.049
NARRATOR:
<i>And that's how Lily</i>

08:38.051 --> 08:39.750
<i>met your mother.</i>

08:40.586 --> 08:42.919
Are Cousin Mitch and I
directly related?

08:42.922 --> 08:44.439
No, Mom, I'm asking

08:44.441 --> 08:46.524
is Cousin Mitch
a blood relative?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.892
I'm not asking
about Cousin Pete,

08:47.894 --> 08:49.277
I'm asking about Cousin Robin!

08:49.279 --> 08:50.311
Mitch!

08:50.313 --> 08:51.396
Cousin Mitch!

08:51.398 --> 08:52.697
Well, just find out
from Uncle Frank

08:52.699 --> 08:53.698
and call me back!

08:53.700 --> 08:55.400
Well, then, go
visit Cousin Cecil

08:55.402 --> 08:57.569
at his sky-diving school
and ask him!

08:57.571 --> 09:00.288
Oh, God, he did?

09:01.223 --> 09:02.490
Well, I guess that can happen

09:02.492 --> 09:04.075
no matter
how experienced you are.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.960
I'm so sorry.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.330
(exhales)

09:09.332 --> 09:10.498
got fired.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.782
(sighs):
Oh.

09:11.784 --> 09:16.979
That's a relief.

09:16.981 --> 09:19.765
Um... I'm so sorry
for your loss.

09:20.534 --> 09:24.036
It may be <i>our</i> loss.

09:24.421 --> 09:25.938
(both shudder)

09:25.940 --> 09:27.973
Just click
on "options"!

09:27.975 --> 09:31.043
All I see is a man
holding a bratwurst!

09:31.045 --> 09:32.277
Oh.

09:32.279 --> 09:34.914
No, the pornography's back.

09:34.916 --> 09:36.949
I said, please turn off
all electronic devices.

09:38.085 --> 09:39.635
Oh. (laughs)

09:39.637 --> 09:41.971
This isn't an
electronic device.

09:41.973 --> 09:43.789
This is actually a toy.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.624
For my son.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.010
We call it Phone-y.
(scoffs)

09:48.012 --> 09:49.895
I call you phony.

09:49.897 --> 09:53.132
We can't take off
till you hang up.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.934
Okay, enough.
Give me that phone!

09:54.936 --> 09:56.285
Just click
on "options""

09:56.287 --> 09:57.803
I don't see it!

09:57.805 --> 09:59.688
I said,
give me the phone!

09:59.690 --> 10:00.973
Just click
on "options"!

10:00.975 --> 10:02.525
Stop yelling at me!

10:02.527 --> 10:03.826
Just click
on "options""

10:03.828 --> 10:04.743
Give me the phone.

10:04.745 --> 10:05.945
Click on "options"!

10:05.947 --> 10:08.047
Click on...
I have a baby!

10:08.049 --> 10:10.149
Please, I-I have to get
to New York.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.834
Yeah, well, you should
have thought about that

10:11.836 --> 10:12.868
before you attacked me.

10:12.870 --> 10:14.253
All right, boys,
you got this?

10:14.255 --> 10:15.538
Good.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.506
Let's get this bird in the air.
Ah, you're both

10:17.508 --> 10:19.008
banned from this flight.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.796
So I was driving with my
friend, who thinks he's

10:23.798 --> 10:25.464
"The Road Trip Master."

10:25.466 --> 10:28.350
He has leather driving gloves.

10:28.352 --> 10:29.885
Who wears those?

10:29.887 --> 10:32.188
Huge dorks, that's who.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.439
NARRATOR:
<i>Your mother was lying.</i>

10:33.441 --> 10:35.608
<i>She had her own pair.</i>

10:35.610 --> 10:36.859
And he always makes us stop

10:36.861 --> 10:39.812
to see some weird
roadside attraction

10:39.814 --> 10:43.182
no one except him
gives a crap about.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.550
Nerd alert.

10:44.552 --> 10:46.418
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>the seven-hour detour</i>

10:46.420 --> 10:47.953
<i>on our road trip</i>
<i>to Disney World</i>

10:47.955 --> 10:50.856
<i>so your mother didn't miss</i>
<i>that goat in South Carolina</i>

10:50.858 --> 10:52.408
<i>who could blow smoke rings.</i>

10:52.410 --> 10:56.862
And he won't go one mile an hour
over the speed limit.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.330
That would drive me crazy.

10:58.332 --> 11:01.417
I would give him
a humiliating nickname

11:01.419 --> 11:04.036
until he stopped driving
like a little girl.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.772
NARRATOR:
It was "Lady Tedwina Slowsby."

11:06.774 --> 11:09.291
<i>And it worked.</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:12.845
Okay, look, if it's
true, if we are...

11:12.847 --> 11:14.213
(gags softly)

11:14.215 --> 11:15.598
You know.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.066
It's really not that big a deal.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.817
Okay, we-we know
we won't have kids.

11:18.819 --> 11:20.152
And even if we did,

11:20.154 --> 11:22.071
King Joffrey's parents
were brother and sister,

11:22.073 --> 11:23.739
and he was
a fair and wise leader.

11:23.741 --> 11:26.442
Yeah. Look, no one
ever needs to know but us.

11:26.444 --> 11:27.076
Exactly.

11:27.078 --> 11:28.244
(both chuckle)

11:28.246 --> 11:29.528
I know.

11:30.780 --> 11:34.567
BARNEY:
<i>We might have to...</i>

11:34.569 --> 11:36.735
ROBIN:
<i>Take care of Ranjit.</i>

11:36.737 --> 11:38.754
<i>Hey, you just finished my...</i>

11:38.756 --> 11:40.923
<i>Creepy telepathic</i>
<i>murder thought.</i>

11:40.925 --> 11:44.210
<i>Oh, it must be</i>
<i>a soul mate thing.</i>

11:44.212 --> 11:45.577
<i>Unless...</i>

11:45.579 --> 11:49.098
<i>it's a weird cousin thing.</i>

11:49.100 --> 11:50.749
(gags softly)

11:50.751 --> 11:53.385
So we'll be good
either way, right?

11:53.387 --> 11:54.920
Honey?

11:54.922 --> 11:58.607
That's right... sweetie.

11:58.609 --> 12:00.859
Now, get over here, you.

12:00.861 --> 12:04.563
Gah, just try
and stop me.

12:16.776 --> 12:17.910
Aw.
Ooh, ooh.

12:17.912 --> 12:19.778
Ooh, mmm, mmm, mmm.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.446
Well, I can't wait
till tonight.

12:21.448 --> 12:22.614
I have got some

12:22.616 --> 12:23.916
naughty-naughty-naughty
things planned.

12:23.918 --> 12:25.050
Aw.

12:25.052 --> 12:27.670
Oh, wow, you have certainly
piqued my incest.

12:27.672 --> 12:29.054
Interest. Interest!

12:31.308 --> 12:34.426
I still can't believe he dragged
me to the childhood home

12:34.428 --> 12:37.713
of some stupid bucklesmith
no one's ever even heard of.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.149
Yeah, who cares
about Florian van Otterloop?

12:40.151 --> 12:42.401
I never told you his name.

12:42.403 --> 12:43.719
Sumbitch?

12:43.721 --> 12:46.605
I mean, why'd he have to
act that way?

12:46.607 --> 12:49.425
He knows I hate
how he gets on road trips.

12:49.427 --> 12:52.477
It almost seems like
he wanted you to storm off.

12:52.479 --> 12:54.330
But we're going
to the same place.

12:54.332 --> 12:57.283
There's no reason
why he'd want to ditch me.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.618
NARRATOR: <i>And suddenly Lily remembered</i>
<i>that a week ago,</i>

12:59.620 --> 13:02.221
<i>I'd helped Robin look</i>
<i>for her long-lost locket.</i>

13:02.223 --> 13:04.489
<i>But it was gone.</i>

13:08.378 --> 13:10.512
<i>Then Lily told me</i>
<i>the locket actually got stashed</i>

13:10.514 --> 13:13.215
<i>in my pencil box,</i>
<i>but when I opened it...</i>

13:13.217 --> 13:15.501
<i>the locket wasn't there.</i>

13:15.503 --> 13:16.802
Good.

13:16.804 --> 13:17.970
'Cause that locket's trouble.

13:17.972 --> 13:19.138
How? It's-it's just a friendly,

13:19.140 --> 13:20.255
innocent wedding gift.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.256
It's not innocent.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.941
Ted, you think

13:22.943 --> 13:26.178
if you can get that locket
for Robin you'll win her back.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.048
Lily, I've let it go.

13:33.870 --> 13:35.537
I mean...
What?

13:35.539 --> 13:37.022
There's, like,
a one percent chance

13:37.024 --> 13:39.458
that Stella has the locket
from when we lived together.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.727
Promise me you didn't call
the woman who left you

13:41.729 --> 13:44.947
at the altar so that
you could find that locket.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.165
Of course not.

13:46.167 --> 13:47.383
I e-mailed her.

13:47.385 --> 13:48.467
Ted.

13:48.469 --> 13:49.718
But Stella's living
in L.A. now.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.719
And even if she has it,

13:50.721 --> 13:52.054
it's buried
in some storage unit.

13:52.056 --> 13:53.555
She said I'd have
to fly out there

13:53.557 --> 13:55.174
and look for it myself.

13:55.176 --> 13:57.542
Promise me you aren't
about to do that.

13:57.544 --> 13:59.311
I promise.

14:00.063 --> 14:01.647
Sumbitch!

14:16.037 --> 14:18.852
You better hope when Sweaty
finally gets off that phone,

14:18.853 --> 14:21.104
he can get me on the next flight
to New York.

14:21.106 --> 14:23.289
I got the password
from my mom.

14:23.291 --> 14:24.857
I'm gonna take that
photo down myself.

14:24.859 --> 14:26.909
You know, I don't give
a damn about your photo.

14:26.911 --> 14:29.395
My daughter is giving
a big speech for the Model U.N.

14:29.397 --> 14:31.998
at her school, and I'm
gonna miss it because of you.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.801
(sighs)

14:34.803 --> 14:37.336
Her father and I are separated.

14:37.338 --> 14:38.788
She lives with her dad.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.924
And if I don't make it...

14:41.926 --> 14:44.877
she's never gonna
trust me again.

14:44.879 --> 14:46.996
I'm so sorry.

14:46.998 --> 14:48.815
Wow, that worked on you?

14:48.817 --> 14:51.517
Let's hope Pit Stains is
as dumb as you are.

14:51.519 --> 14:53.236
What? Why is this
so hard for my mom?

14:53.238 --> 14:54.270
All you do

14:54.272 --> 14:55.905
is you click the photo,

14:55.907 --> 14:57.940
and then you click on the...

14:57.942 --> 15:00.643
I don't see...
I don't see "options."

15:00.645 --> 15:03.029
Just click on "options."

15:03.031 --> 15:03.946
But where is it?

15:03.948 --> 15:05.064
Just click on "options."

15:05.066 --> 15:06.282
Is it up on the toolbar?

15:06.284 --> 15:08.284
Just click on "options."
It's not there!

15:08.286 --> 15:11.537
Just click on "options"!

15:12.790 --> 15:15.074
(phone ringing)

15:15.076 --> 15:16.592
Hi, Grandma.

15:16.594 --> 15:19.178
You-you can explain how
Cousin Mitch is related to us?

15:19.180 --> 15:21.147
Explain, Grandma, explain!

15:21.149 --> 15:22.965
Okay, he married
Barney's dad's cousin Renee,

15:22.967 --> 15:24.550
who he met selling Vachon cakes

15:24.552 --> 15:26.969
outside a curling bonspiel
in Chicoutimi.

15:26.971 --> 15:28.304
English, Grandma, English!

15:28.306 --> 15:30.940
And on our side of the family,
he was adopted

15:30.942 --> 15:32.775
because his real parents
were eaten alive

15:32.777 --> 15:33.860
by their sled dogs?

15:33.862 --> 15:36.095
That's awesome!
Thanks, Grandma.

15:36.097 --> 15:38.214
(both sigh)

15:38.216 --> 15:39.532
So...

15:39.534 --> 15:42.268
So you and I share
no DNA whatsoever.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.370
Let's change that.

15:44.372 --> 15:46.038
(both moaning)

15:46.040 --> 15:47.623
RANJIT:
Don't hold back.

15:47.625 --> 15:50.209
This divider is
totally soundproof.

15:50.211 --> 15:53.546
Go all the way.

15:53.548 --> 15:55.131
Wait till the hotel?

15:55.133 --> 15:56.048
Totally.

15:56.917 --> 15:58.301
Hey, you know what?

15:58.303 --> 16:01.137
I'm not worried about a wild
card at our wedding anymore.

16:01.139 --> 16:03.673
Whether it's Uncle Vic
or Aunt Shelly

16:03.675 --> 16:04.724
or the ring bear.

16:04.726 --> 16:06.309
Ring bear-er. Er.

16:06.311 --> 16:08.594
Whether any
of those mammals go rogue,

16:08.596 --> 16:12.515
our wedding is
gonna be legendary.

16:13.317 --> 16:14.901
No "wait for it"?

16:14.903 --> 16:17.236
I've got you.

16:17.238 --> 16:20.156
I don't have to
wait for it anymore.

16:25.696 --> 16:27.864
(phone ringing)

16:32.419 --> 16:34.604
(line ringing)

16:34.606 --> 16:35.922
It's a long story,

16:35.924 --> 16:38.174
but if we don't beat my friend
out to that wedding,

16:38.176 --> 16:39.342
it's gonna be bad.

16:39.344 --> 16:41.961
This is too stressful.
I-I need to see Marvin!

16:41.963 --> 16:44.046
No! You made me promise
not to let you look,

16:44.048 --> 16:45.548
because it's
only gonna upset you.

16:45.550 --> 16:48.718
Here, have another sum... bitch.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.804
No more sumbitches?!

16:51.806 --> 16:53.505
Give me the damn phone!

16:53.507 --> 16:54.924
(both scream)

16:54.926 --> 16:56.926
(clamoring) Just go to "edi""
on the toolbar!

16:56.928 --> 16:58.344
No, "account settings"!

16:58.346 --> 16:59.879
Just click
on "options""

16:59.881 --> 17:01.364
Stop!

17:01.366 --> 17:04.133
It can't be done.

17:04.135 --> 17:07.103
That photo is etched
in eternity.

17:07.105 --> 17:09.655
Long after humanity's
reign has ended,

17:09.656 --> 17:11.690
the only traces
of our civilization found

17:11.692 --> 17:13.358
by Earth's new ape masters
will be

17:13.361 --> 17:15.328
the top
of the Statue of Liberty

17:15.329 --> 17:17.546
and this photo of me
pretending to be

17:17.548 --> 17:21.300
a judge with a banana gavel.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.435
Well, they'll probably like
the banana thing.

17:23.438 --> 17:25.054
The ape masters?

17:26.138 --> 17:27.973
Sorry.
Lily's gonna see it,

17:27.976 --> 17:30.476
and we're gonna have
the biggest fight of our lives.

17:30.478 --> 17:33.896
(chuckles) Oh, I wish I could
see your wife kick your ass.

17:33.898 --> 17:36.399
I don't mean a physical fight.

17:36.401 --> 17:37.466
She's not an animal.

17:37.468 --> 17:39.902
I'm sorry I tried
to bite you.

17:39.904 --> 17:42.488
I'm sorry that I swatted you
on the nose

17:42.490 --> 17:43.739
with a rolled-up magazine.

17:43.741 --> 17:46.342
It's the only way I'll learn.

17:48.595 --> 17:52.498
Look, I haven't seen
my baby in a week.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.566
You know what?

17:54.568 --> 17:56.085
Go for it.

18:05.429 --> 18:06.779
It's gone!

18:06.781 --> 18:08.464
It's gone!
(all cheering)

18:08.466 --> 18:09.581
You did it!

18:09.583 --> 18:12.584
You did it! (laughs)

18:13.770 --> 18:16.272
No new insulting Marvin photo.

18:16.274 --> 18:17.890
Hmm.

18:17.892 --> 18:22.645
(voice breaks):
No new insulting Marvin photo.

18:22.647 --> 18:25.281
I know I'm just a stranger
on a train

18:25.283 --> 18:29.535
who you tried to bite, but...
do you want a hug?

18:49.172 --> 18:51.590
(Lily yells)

18:51.592 --> 18:54.427
Lily! What the hell?!

18:57.064 --> 19:00.016
Ted and I had some
road trip issues.

19:00.018 --> 19:01.817
Did he put on the gloves?
Mm-hmm.

19:01.819 --> 19:03.469
That tackle was justified.

19:04.221 --> 19:05.855
What's this?
It's for you.

19:05.857 --> 19:07.857
Don't open it.

19:10.977 --> 19:12.862
TED: With all
the big changes coming up,

19:12.864 --> 19:15.498
I just wanted Robin
to remember her friends.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.367
We all want nothing but
happiness for you and Barney.

19:18.369 --> 19:19.985
Right, Lily?

19:20.871 --> 19:22.755
Right.

19:22.757 --> 19:24.924
Oh, wow.

19:24.926 --> 19:26.292
That was, what, eight years ago?

19:26.294 --> 19:27.326
Yeah.

19:27.328 --> 19:29.462
Eight years.

19:30.297 --> 19:32.381
Thanks, Ted.

19:37.888 --> 19:40.689
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get checked in.

19:41.558 --> 19:44.477
Marshall's flight just took off.

19:44.479 --> 19:46.178
My boys will be here soon.

19:46.180 --> 19:47.730
Oh, yay.

19:47.732 --> 19:49.949
NARRATOR: <i>Actually, Lily's boys were</i>
<i>just learning there was</i>

19:49.951 --> 19:52.802
<i>only one more flight out</i>
<i>to New York with one seat left,</i>

19:52.804 --> 19:55.204
<i>and it was all the way</i>
<i>across the airport.</i>

20:13.540 --> 20:15.674
You're not gonna
tackle me again, are you?

20:15.676 --> 20:16.875
I'm the maid of honor.

20:16.877 --> 20:18.811
There's a good chance
that won't be

20:18.813 --> 20:20.229
my only tackle of the weekend.

20:20.231 --> 20:22.064
NARRATOR:
<i>It wasn't.</i>

20:22.066 --> 20:24.216
Look, I'm sorry.

20:24.218 --> 20:27.052
I just got it in my head
that you somehow managed

20:27.054 --> 20:28.821
to track down that locket
in Los Angeles,

20:28.823 --> 20:30.906
and now you were gonna
blow up the wedding.

20:30.908 --> 20:32.858
You really think I'm that crazy?

20:33.677 --> 20:36.228
(sighs)
I guess that's fair.

20:36.230 --> 20:40.166
Look, even though I was wrong,
tell me you aren't thinking

20:40.168 --> 20:42.751
about doing anything
insane this weekend.

20:42.753 --> 20:44.703
Of course not.

NARRATOR:
<i>And all I can say, kids,</i>

20:47.325 --> 20:51.026

<i>But the truth is...</i>
<i>you never know</i>

20:55.222 --> 20:57.372
<i>who's gonna be the wild card</i>
<i>at a wedding.</i>

20:58.166 --> 21:01.127
Hi. One ticket

21:10.482 --> 21:13.183

21:13.185 --> 21:14.351
Are you chewing gum?

21:14.353 --> 21:15.569
You never chew gum.

21:15.571 --> 21:17.470
You shouldn't chew gum
in here.

21:17.472 --> 21:20.190
Nobody cares if
I chew gum, Ted.

21:20.192 --> 21:21.241
Are you chewing gum?

21:21.243 --> 21:23.110
Yes, she is.
She's chewing gum.

21:23.112 --> 21:24.327
Ooh, can I have a piece?

21:24.329 --> 21:26.163
Of course!
Great.

21:26.165 --> 21:27.197
Thank you.

21:27.199 --> 21:28.448
Okay, let's chew some gum

21:28.450 --> 21:30.150
and get you guys
all checked in.

21:30.152 --> 21:32.202
Ms. Aldrin, how many
keys will you need?

21:32.204 --> 21:33.153
Two, please.

21:33.155 --> 21:34.254
My husband's
getting in later.

21:34.256 --> 21:35.839
Excellent, and Mr. Mosby?

21:35.841 --> 21:36.957
Uh, just one, please.

21:36.959 --> 21:40.026
Oh, oh, I-I see.

21:40.028 --> 21:41.962
Oh.

21:41.964 --> 21:43.914
Well, hang in there.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.715
You'll find somebody.

21:45.717 --> 21:48.602
Thank you,
front desk stranger.

21:48.604 --> 21:50.871
I'm sorry, we just... we just
don't get a lot of singles here.

21:50.873 --> 21:51.972
I mean,
look at this place.

21:51.974 --> 21:53.507
It's so romantic.

21:53.509 --> 21:56.943
Countless babies conceived
within these walls.

21:56.945 --> 21:59.362
And one... grisly murder.

21:59.364 --> 22:00.513
Now, are you sure
that you wouldn't

22:00.515 --> 22:03.349
feel more comfortable
staying at a motel?

22:03.351 --> 22:04.534
What? No, look.

22:04.536 --> 22:06.486
I'm not some miserable,
lonely person.

22:06.488 --> 22:07.854
Tell him, Lily.

22:07.856 --> 22:09.456
It's a tough
weekend for him.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.490
Bro.

22:10.492 --> 22:12.159
We're here for a wedding.
Ouch.

22:12.161 --> 22:14.995
And he used to date the bride.
Ooh, mama.

22:14.997 --> 22:16.980
And he's the best man.
Devastating.

22:16.982 --> 22:18.582
Could you please
just check us in?

22:18.584 --> 22:20.217
Oh, your rooms aren't
gonna be ready for hours.

22:20.219 --> 22:21.918
But in the meantime,

22:21.920 --> 22:24.304
Ms. Aldrin, I definitely think

22:24.306 --> 22:26.389
you and your husband should
check out the lighthouse.

22:26.391 --> 22:29.142
It's a beautiful view
of the bay-- so romantic.

22:29.144 --> 22:30.177
Oh, wow.

22:30.179 --> 22:31.761
Here's the channel guide

22:31.763 --> 22:33.480
for the TV.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.715
Don't listen
to him, Ted.

22:35.717 --> 22:38.051
(phone ringing)
You are not alone.

22:38.053 --> 22:40.904
In fact, this
whole weekend,

22:40.906 --> 22:43.440
it is going to be
nothing but me and...

22:43.442 --> 22:44.825
Marshall!

22:44.827 --> 22:46.009
Oh, thank God,
you're on your way.

22:46.011 --> 22:48.044
If I had to be here alone,
I would kill myself.

22:49.230 --> 22:50.363
How are you doing?

22:50.365 --> 22:52.782
I'm fine... Curtis.

22:52.784 --> 22:54.668
I mean, let's do
the math here.

22:54.670 --> 22:58.788
One "best man" plus one
"no girlfriend" equals...

22:58.790 --> 23:01.541
"Mothers of Farhampton,
lock up your daughters!"

23:01.543 --> 23:03.426
Double guns!

23:03.428 --> 23:05.512
(imitating gunshots)

23:10.051 --> 23:11.384
Wow, you're in bad shape.

23:11.386 --> 23:12.602
Marshall missed
his flight.

23:12.604 --> 23:14.271
He might not get
here tonight.

23:14.273 --> 23:16.756
He might not
get here at all.

23:16.758 --> 23:17.941
We...

23:17.943 --> 23:19.914
only have a few
of these left.

Hi...

23:25.384 --> 23:26.399
Linus.

23:26.401 --> 23:28.068
Here's how this goes down.

23:28.070 --> 23:30.570
If I'm going to make it through
this weekend without my husband,

23:30.572 --> 23:32.656
I need you to hook a lady up.

23:32.658 --> 23:35.208
Any time you see me
without a drink in my hand,

23:35.210 --> 23:37.310
you put a drink in my hand.

23:37.312 --> 23:40.380
Are you my guy, Linus?

23:41.232 --> 23:42.549
So you want the Kennedy Package?

23:42.551 --> 23:44.134
Bingo.

23:45.586 --> 23:47.637
(phone rings)
Go for Barney.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.340
Ah.

23:50.342 --> 23:52.842
Thank you Linus.

23:52.844 --> 23:54.227
Barney,
before you get too upset,

23:54.229 --> 23:56.446
there's another flight
that leaves in five minutes.

23:56.448 --> 23:58.131
You're getting on it.
I'm gonna try.

23:58.133 --> 23:59.516
There is no try!

23:59.518 --> 24:00.901
You're getting on that plane.

24:00.903 --> 24:02.652
Hey, growth spurt.

24:02.654 --> 24:05.638
If there is only one seat
left on this plane,

24:05.640 --> 24:07.473
I will fight you for it.

24:07.475 --> 24:09.475
And I'm a biter.

24:09.477 --> 24:11.111
Marshall, whoever that is,
grab her carry-on

24:11.113 --> 24:12.645
and throw it
into a restricted area.

24:12.647 --> 24:14.331
I'm serious. Do it.
Do it now.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.832
What? No.

24:15.834 --> 24:16.917
Barney, are you...?

24:16.919 --> 24:18.418
No, I'm not gonna...

24:18.420 --> 24:19.502
That's... No.

24:19.504 --> 24:21.671
There is no
"What, no, Barney, are you,

24:21.673 --> 24:23.707
no I'm not gonna, that's no!"

24:23.709 --> 24:25.825
This is a holiday weekend.

24:25.827 --> 24:28.828
You're not gonna get
to New York by being nice.

24:28.830 --> 24:31.264
So you're gonna have
to lose the whole Midwestern

24:31.266 --> 24:32.832
aw-shucksy-doodles thing...

24:32.834 --> 24:33.883
Shucksy doodles?

24:33.885 --> 24:35.268
...and act like a New Yorker.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.687
A pushy, obnoxious,
knock-the-other-guy-down-

24:37.689 --> 24:40.223
and-take-his-hot-dog resident
of the greatest city on earth!

24:40.225 --> 24:41.775
No can do, Barney.

24:41.777 --> 24:42.943
I'm from Minnesota,

24:42.945 --> 24:45.278
where there's plenty of hot dogs
for everyone.

24:46.781 --> 24:49.349
Perhaps even too many.

24:49.351 --> 24:50.367
But listen,

24:50.369 --> 24:51.952
I'm gonna get to New York

24:51.954 --> 24:53.286
without being a jerk.

24:53.288 --> 24:55.021
Just get to New York!

24:55.023 --> 24:56.022
I'll get to New York!

24:56.024 --> 24:57.607
Nobody's getting to New York.

24:57.609 --> 24:59.025
Not this weekend anyway.

24:59.027 --> 25:01.661
There's a big storm
rolling up the East Coast.

25:01.663 --> 25:03.580
All the airports
are closing.

25:03.582 --> 25:06.366
My advice is
rent a car and drive.

25:06.368 --> 25:07.467
But you better hurry.

25:07.469 --> 25:09.436
They're gonna
run out of cars soon.

25:09.438 --> 25:10.820
(groans)

25:10.822 --> 25:12.255
Okay, listen.

25:12.257 --> 25:13.590
If we're both
going to New York,

25:13.592 --> 25:16.810
why don't we rent a car,
split the drive?

25:16.812 --> 25:18.595
That seems like
a reasonable plan.

25:18.597 --> 25:20.897
Can I help you with
that diaper bag?

25:20.899 --> 25:23.350
Sure. Thank you.
Oh, it's...

25:25.353 --> 25:28.238
Have a nice bus ride,
pumpkin head!

25:32.093 --> 25:34.277
(panting)

25:37.832 --> 25:40.533
Hey, lady.

25:40.535 --> 25:42.369
Yeah, you just threw away
your ticket

25:42.371 --> 25:43.870
to a really great road trip.

25:43.872 --> 25:46.206
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.341
You're all the way back there,

25:48.343 --> 25:50.576
and I'm all the way
up here.

25:50.578 --> 25:52.879
(laughing)
Oh, you can hear me.

25:52.881 --> 25:55.465
Get ready to be driving
the jealous-mobile

25:55.467 --> 25:57.600
because our car is
gonna have games,

25:57.602 --> 26:00.420
snacks, a James Patterson
audio book

26:00.422 --> 26:04.290
my mother describes as
"cluttering her glove box."

26:04.292 --> 26:07.360
Your car? I'll be in Pittsburgh
before you get your car.

26:07.362 --> 26:09.979
We'll see about that.

26:09.981 --> 26:11.948
And if you're going to New York,
you're not gonna want

26:11.950 --> 26:13.033
to go through Pittsburgh.

26:13.035 --> 26:14.434
94 backs up around Allentown,

26:14.436 --> 26:16.870
so you're gonna want
to stick on 80.

26:16.872 --> 26:18.321
Jerk face!

26:20.374 --> 26:22.608
Come on, universe.

Okay, people, let's move
it along. What do you want?

You want a car? You got a car.
Beat it.

26:44.015 --> 26:45.348
What kind of car
do you want?

26:45.350 --> 26:47.434
Too slow, you get a minivan.

26:47.436 --> 26:49.803
Next. Ah, midsize sedan.

26:49.805 --> 26:51.154
Incoming. Next.

26:51.156 --> 26:52.922
Yes!
You want a gas option?

26:52.924 --> 26:54.524
Nobody wants a gas option.
Get out of here.

26:54.526 --> 26:55.525
Next.

26:55.527 --> 26:57.777
Hello. I need a car.

26:57.779 --> 27:00.146
You've got it.
That's all of them.

27:00.148 --> 27:02.265
We're all out of cars,
everybody.

27:02.267 --> 27:03.833
Wait, no!

27:03.835 --> 27:05.385
You let this guy beat you?

27:05.387 --> 27:07.087
Ma'am, it's not a race.

27:07.089 --> 27:10.090
That right there
is why you lost.

27:10.858 --> 27:13.209
Maybe this is your fault.

27:13.211 --> 27:14.461
Did you ever think of that?

27:14.463 --> 27:15.712
Maybe if you
had just been

27:15.714 --> 27:18.164
a little bit nicer,
then you would be

27:18.166 --> 27:19.883

27:43.825 --> 27:46.242
Do you have anything else?
I'll take the Monstrosity.

27:46.244 --> 27:48.411
There's nothing else.
Give me the keys, old man!

27:48.413 --> 27:49.879
It's just so freaking huge!

27:49.881 --> 27:52.031
Well, actually it's
a Monstrosity Sport,

27:52.033 --> 27:53.917
so it's a little smaller.

27:53.919 --> 27:55.885
♪ Monstrosity Sport

27:55.887 --> 27:58.755
♪ It's still freaking huge.

27:58.757 --> 28:00.256
Fine. I'll take it.

28:00.258 --> 28:01.925
But I'm also gonna need
a baby seat.

28:01.927 --> 28:04.177
We're all out of baby seats.
Get out of here.

28:04.179 --> 28:05.845
Oh, my God--
what am I gonna do?

28:05.847 --> 28:07.113
I don't care.

28:07.115 --> 28:09.149
(groans)

28:09.151 --> 28:10.433
Can I make a suggestion?

28:11.352 --> 28:12.602
I rent the car,

28:12.604 --> 28:15.221
then I go buy the car seat,
come back here,

28:15.223 --> 28:18.224
pick you guys up,
and then the three of us

28:18.226 --> 28:19.959
drive to New York together.

28:19.961 --> 28:21.828
(laughs quietly)

28:21.830 --> 28:24.164
Let me get this straight.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.566
So, you're gonna
rent the car,

28:26.568 --> 28:29.536
go and get a baby seat
for my son,

28:29.538 --> 28:33.122
and then drive all the way
back here to pick me up.

28:33.124 --> 28:34.390
That's right.

28:34.392 --> 28:37.460
Well, then you're
gonna need some cash. Here.

28:37.462 --> 28:39.429
Hundred bucks ought to cover it.

28:39.431 --> 28:40.763
So, we'll see
you soon.

28:40.765 --> 28:42.632
You got it, Michael!
Marshall.

28:42.634 --> 28:45.051
Doesn't matter now, does it?

28:48.189 --> 28:50.423
Remember this day, Marvin.

28:51.475 --> 28:54.561
Not only is this the day
that we either saw Prince

28:54.563 --> 28:57.981
or a... a really flamboyantly
dressed greyhound,

28:57.983 --> 29:01.734
it's also the day that your dad
chose not to be a jerk...

29:01.736 --> 29:04.387
and put his trust in humanity.

29:04.389 --> 29:07.123
Just watch where it gets us.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.212
Shucksy-doodles!

29:14.054 --> 29:15.665
NARRATOR: <i>Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>was just about ready</i>

29:15.666 --> 29:17.148
<i>to abandon</i>
<i>his faith in humanity.</i>

29:18.222 --> 29:19.839
But let's back up a little bit.

29:19.841 --> 29:24.043
And now the true tale
of the Stinson Curse.

29:24.045 --> 29:27.913
BARNEY:
<i>Moscow, 1807.</i>

29:27.915 --> 29:29.982
(Russian accent): What a wonderful night
at the opera.

29:29.984 --> 29:31.951
Wouldn't you agree,
Comrade Barnovski?

29:31.953 --> 29:34.403
(Russian accent): I would indeed,
Comrade Jamesokoff.

29:34.405 --> 29:37.573
But you know what made it
truly wonderful?

29:37.575 --> 29:40.176
Being here with my wife...

29:40.178 --> 29:43.946
the beet in my borscht,
the fur on my hat,

29:43.948 --> 29:49.034
the only person I've ever
been attracted to, ever.

29:49.036 --> 29:51.220
I feel the same way
about Kyle...

29:51.222 --> 29:53.305
my plutonic friend
from work.

29:53.307 --> 29:55.057
(clattering)

29:55.059 --> 29:58.778
Is it just me, or did that feel
like we hit an old Gypsy woman?

29:58.780 --> 30:00.546
Yep. Old Gypsy woman.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.315
Good call, Barnovski.
Oh, well, she's just a peasant.

30:03.317 --> 30:04.300
Home, Smirnoff.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.718
Wait, she's
saying somethink!

30:06.720 --> 30:08.104
(low, deep moan)

30:08.106 --> 30:09.939
Hornier.

30:11.891 --> 30:13.659
Hornier.

30:14.444 --> 30:15.995
Hornier?

30:15.997 --> 30:17.896
Sonobovich!

30:17.898 --> 30:20.015
Did she just put a curse on us?

30:20.017 --> 30:21.584
Eh, nonsense, brother.

30:21.586 --> 30:24.453
Okay, let's go, Smirnoff.

30:24.455 --> 30:25.671
Smirnoff?

30:26.506 --> 30:29.692
Homina, hominovich. Mmm,

30:29.694 --> 30:34.396
Smirnoff, I would climb you
like the Kremlin Wall.

30:34.398 --> 30:35.914
What's happening to me?

30:35.916 --> 30:38.517
Don't you see?
You're getting hornier, brother,

30:38.519 --> 30:41.137
just like
the old Gypsy woman said!

30:41.139 --> 30:42.505
Oh, hello there.

30:43.807 --> 30:47.643
(chuckles) Ever had
a White Russian?

30:50.447 --> 30:52.764
BARNEY:
<i>For the next 200 years,</i>

30:52.766 --> 30:55.434
<i>every male member</i>
<i>of the Stinson family</i>

30:55.436 --> 30:58.537
<i>was afflicted</i>
<i>by the Gypsy's curse,</i>

30:58.539 --> 31:00.105
<i>an unquenchable thirst</i>
<i>for booty</i>

31:00.107 --> 31:04.260
that no committed relationship
<i>could ever satisfy.</i>

31:04.262 --> 31:06.545
That is, until my brother James

31:06.547 --> 31:08.481
met his husband Tom.

31:08.483 --> 31:11.450
The day they got married,
they lifted the curse forever,

31:11.452 --> 31:13.385
freeing me from the shackles

31:13.387 --> 31:15.588
of having sex
with lots of different women.

31:15.590 --> 31:16.589
Although, sometimes

31:16.591 --> 31:18.390
Robin and I still use
the shackles.

31:18.392 --> 31:19.341
Bondage five!

31:19.343 --> 31:21.060
Whoa.
I can't, I can't,

31:21.062 --> 31:21.977
I can't.

31:21.979 --> 31:24.096
(phone rings)
Go for Barney!

31:25.131 --> 31:26.782
Ah.

31:26.784 --> 31:30.186
Thank you, Linus.

31:30.188 --> 31:31.770
This is worse
than I thought.

31:31.772 --> 31:33.639
I know.
Showtime, no HBO?

31:33.641 --> 31:35.107
JAMES:
No.

31:36.142 --> 31:38.494
Tom and I are getting divorced.

31:38.496 --> 31:39.795
What?
TED: What?

31:39.797 --> 31:42.164
That's why you look
extra handsome.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.083
I do get extra hot
when I'm single.

31:44.085 --> 31:45.100
Your skin looks amazing.

31:45.102 --> 31:46.418
Looks amazing.
I know.

31:46.420 --> 31:48.754
So... so what happened?
Why-why'd you guys break up?

31:48.756 --> 31:50.339
Well, the thing to remember

31:50.341 --> 31:51.874
is that when something
like this happens,

31:51.876 --> 31:52.892
it's nobody's fault.

31:52.894 --> 31:55.027
You cheated on him.
Repeatedly.

31:56.046 --> 31:57.346
I thought about
keeping it quiet,

31:57.348 --> 32:00.466
but then I realized,
wouldn't my family want me

32:00.468 --> 32:04.053
to be honest with them
about news this big?

32:04.055 --> 32:07.523
Oh, can I just say five things?

32:09.292 --> 32:12.778
What is the matter with--
sorry, six-- you?!

32:12.780 --> 32:14.630
Ooh! What?!

32:14.632 --> 32:17.366
I'm-I'm sorry
about you and Tom,

32:17.368 --> 32:19.785
but you can't just drop
a bombshell like this

32:19.787 --> 32:21.303
so close to
someone's wedding.

32:21.305 --> 32:23.973
You broke the curse.
You and Tom

32:23.975 --> 32:25.074
are the only couple

32:25.076 --> 32:26.742
that makes Barney
believe in marriage.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.078
(chuckles) Really?
The only couple?

32:29.080 --> 32:32.298
I mean, no one else
comes to mind?

32:32.300 --> 32:34.133
Been together 17 years?

32:34.135 --> 32:36.868
She's a spunky redhead,
he's got calves

32:36.870 --> 32:39.388
that launched a thousand
lady boners?

32:39.390 --> 32:40.589
BARNEY:
Hey, sorry about that.

32:40.591 --> 32:41.924
Hey, did you guys know

32:41.926 --> 32:45.511
that Sunday is James' and Tom's
anniversary?

32:45.513 --> 32:47.546
How cool is that?

32:47.548 --> 32:48.681
We're anniversary bros!

32:48.683 --> 32:50.549
Every year, we should go out
and celebrate...

32:50.551 --> 32:51.850
just the two of us.

32:51.852 --> 32:53.786
Listen, bro, you...

32:53.788 --> 32:56.105
I know, I know, "Please, Barney,

32:56.107 --> 32:59.358
you don't have to get us
an anniversary gift this year."

32:59.360 --> 33:00.593
You get them an
anniversary gift?

33:00.595 --> 33:02.111
Why shouldn't I?
They're the one couple

33:02.113 --> 33:03.862
that makes me believe marriage
is possible.

33:03.864 --> 33:05.897
I mean, I'm sitting right here.

33:06.899 --> 33:08.450
Thank you, Linus.

33:08.452 --> 33:10.202
JAMES:
Barney, the thing is...

33:10.204 --> 33:13.622
Cover your ears and hum "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic""

33:13.624 --> 33:14.807
Why?

33:14.809 --> 33:17.359
It's for the bride.

33:17.361 --> 33:18.844
Oh, it's for... (humming)

33:18.846 --> 33:20.045
Okay, listen, James,

33:20.047 --> 33:21.714
my cousin Vince
is a Mountie.

33:21.716 --> 33:24.433
His girlfriend is back home,
but he gets gay at weddings.

33:24.435 --> 33:26.135
He's yours.
I am giving you Vince.

33:26.137 --> 33:27.720
Just please,
don't tell Barney.

33:27.722 --> 33:29.138
If he finds out
that the only

33:29.140 --> 33:30.806
successful marriage
in his life is over...

33:30.808 --> 33:32.107
I hate everyone
at this table.

33:32.109 --> 33:33.108
...it'll spook him.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.410
I don't want him
getting spooked.

33:34.412 --> 33:36.545
Robin, have some faith.

33:36.547 --> 33:39.481
Do you really think what you
and Barney have is that fragile?

33:40.483 --> 33:42.451
I don't want to find out.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.119
Fine.

33:46.873 --> 33:48.073
Thanks, baby.

33:48.075 --> 33:49.575
No sweat.
Mmm...

33:49.577 --> 33:52.394
So, James, seriously,
where's Tom?

33:52.396 --> 33:53.629
He can't make the wedding.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.080
He had his wisdom teeth out.

33:55.082 --> 33:56.448
Ugh! On top of a divorce?

33:56.450 --> 33:57.666
That is rough.

33:58.735 --> 34:00.402
Uh-oh.

34:00.404 --> 34:03.472
What is she talking about?

34:04.441 --> 34:06.742
Tom and I are getting a divorce.

34:10.397 --> 34:11.847
Excuse me.

34:16.101 --> 34:19.088
Vince... off the table.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.742
What was that?
I don't know.

34:23.744 --> 34:25.177
It just came out.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.879
That's it.
It's barely even noon.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.496
You're cut off.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.199
Thank you, Linus.

34:31.284 --> 34:32.835
Thank you, Linus.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.487
Thank you, Linus.

34:36.339 --> 34:37.989
Thank you, Linus.

34:37.991 --> 34:39.507
Thank you, Linus.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.592
Okay, but after that one,
you're cut off!

34:43.396 --> 34:45.880
No! No, you are not doing this.
Step away from the desk.

34:45.882 --> 34:46.965
What are you talking about?

34:46.967 --> 34:48.600
You just found out
about James and Tom,

34:48.601 --> 34:51.018
and it totally freaked you out,
and now you're asking this guy

34:51.021 --> 34:52.187
to point you in the direction

34:52.188 --> 34:53.405
of the nearest,
dirtiest strip club.

34:53.407 --> 34:55.507
Oh, well,
that-that's a tough one.

34:55.509 --> 34:58.227
Uh, the nearest one
that's-that's kind of dirty

34:58.229 --> 34:59.795
is The Sand Box,

34:59.797 --> 35:02.731
but the, uh...
the dirtiest one that's nearby

35:02.733 --> 35:04.516
is The Crab Shed.

35:04.518 --> 35:05.634
Dude.

35:05.636 --> 35:08.237
Sorry. Uh, but hey,
if-if you do go,

35:08.239 --> 35:10.205
maybe you could take Ted.

35:10.207 --> 35:11.857
I'm really worried
about that kid.

35:13.159 --> 35:15.711
No, Robin, I am not
going to a strip club.

35:15.713 --> 35:16.979
Especially right now.

35:16.981 --> 35:20.165
Could you imagine
the day shift at The Crab Shed?

35:21.217 --> 35:23.085
Robin...

35:23.087 --> 35:25.971
I came to the desk to get this.

35:25.973 --> 35:27.656
Is that the key to our room?

35:27.658 --> 35:29.391
It's the key to James's room.

35:35.098 --> 35:36.432
Oh, my.

35:36.434 --> 35:37.816
What is that?

35:37.818 --> 35:39.168
It's an erotic cake.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.052
I wanted to surprise them
for their anniversary.

35:41.054 --> 35:42.521
Is that... is that
James and Tom?

35:42.523 --> 35:46.408
Mmm, caramel marzipan,
chocolate marzipan.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.976
I love chocolate
marzipan.

35:47.978 --> 35:50.779
So does Tom.
Used to anyway.

35:51.998 --> 35:55.066
This is, uh, absolutely the,
uh... the weirdest thing

35:55.068 --> 35:57.786
anyone has ever done
for their sibling.

35:59.205 --> 36:01.406
I love you so much.

36:02.241 --> 36:04.343
You thought I was
gonna freak out.

36:04.345 --> 36:06.879
Well, I mean, a Gypsy
cursed your family

36:06.881 --> 36:09.765
to become hornier and do
awesome guitar solos.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.517
Can you blame me?

36:11.519 --> 36:14.019
Look, am I bummed about James
and Tom getting a divorce?

36:14.021 --> 36:17.139
Obviously.
But I don't need them

36:17.141 --> 36:19.525
to make me believe
in true love anymore.

36:19.527 --> 36:20.976
I've got you for that now.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.778
Mmm.

36:22.780 --> 36:26.248
Oh, man, now I gotta figure out
what to do with all this stuff.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.400
Well, before we do that...

36:28.402 --> 36:31.453
um, would it be all
right if I nibbled

36:31.455 --> 36:33.906
on your brother's
Ding Dong?

36:33.908 --> 36:36.575
How about we nibble

36:36.577 --> 36:40.412
on my brother's
Ding Dong together?

36:40.414 --> 36:42.297
I'd like that.

36:44.116 --> 36:46.335
NARRATOR: So, they cleaned all that stuff
<i>out of there</i>

36:46.337 --> 36:48.003
<i>and had a talk with James.</i>

36:48.005 --> 36:51.507
<i>And Barney didn't freak out,</i>
because here's the thing, kids.

36:51.509 --> 36:55.561
<i>When you believe in people,</i>
<i>people come through.</i>

37:00.834 --> 37:03.252
Just so we're clear,
I pick the music.

37:03.254 --> 37:04.536
Of course.

37:04.538 --> 37:05.521
Say it.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.256
Say, "Daphne picks the music."

37:07.258 --> 37:09.074
Daphne picks the music.

37:09.076 --> 37:10.242
And you pay for gas.

37:10.244 --> 37:11.994
Are you kidding?
Do you have any idea

37:11.996 --> 37:13.228
how much gas this thing takes?

37:13.230 --> 37:14.429
(engine revs)
No, no, okay!

37:14.431 --> 37:15.764
Okay, I pay for gas.

37:15.766 --> 37:17.332
Good. Now, get in.

37:17.334 --> 37:19.150
It's a long ride to Phoenix.

37:19.152 --> 37:20.719
Say what?

37:20.721 --> 37:23.088
(laughs)
I'm just kidding.

37:23.090 --> 37:25.207
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

37:30.029 --> 37:31.847
This must be the singles table.

37:31.849 --> 37:35.517
(chuckles)
Guess it is.

37:37.003 --> 37:39.204
Well, it's kind of nice
to be asking this question

37:39.206 --> 37:40.689
instead of answering it
for a change:

37:40.691 --> 37:41.757
How are you doing?

37:41.759 --> 37:43.675
I don't know.

37:44.561 --> 37:46.278
I'm trying to be happy
for my brother,

37:46.280 --> 37:48.013
but, uh... I guess a person

37:48.015 --> 37:49.898
has a different
perspective on weddings

37:49.900 --> 37:53.335
when he knows what's down there
at the end of the aisle.

37:54.270 --> 37:56.438
It's not all
champagne and frosting.

37:57.407 --> 38:00.525
Mr. Stinson, your room is ready.

38:00.527 --> 38:02.311
And, Ted...

38:02.313 --> 38:04.496
she's right around the corner.

38:04.498 --> 38:06.081
Thank you, Curtis.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.883
I feel it, too.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.418
No, no, no, the-the housekeeper.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.503
She's in the room that's right
around the corner from yours.

38:11.505 --> 38:12.671
Oh.
So another hour, tops.

38:12.673 --> 38:14.923
Sure.

38:14.925 --> 38:16.508
Okay, see you later, Ted.

38:16.510 --> 38:18.176
You're not
giving up, James.

38:19.211 --> 38:21.079
And neither am I.

38:36.079 --> 38:37.296
(footsteps approach)

38:37.298 --> 38:38.363
TED:
Hey, beautiful.

38:38.365 --> 38:39.348
Hi.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.333
God, you look great.

38:41.335 --> 38:43.218
What? Come on.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.269
You do!

38:44.271 --> 38:46.088
I've been in a car all morning.

38:46.090 --> 38:49.441
I just ate a croissant crumb
that I found in my bra.

38:49.443 --> 38:50.759
I'm disgusting.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.679
Yeah, I saw you do that.
And it was super hot. Come here.

38:53.681 --> 38:55.347
(chuckles) You come here.
Come here.

38:55.349 --> 38:58.216
No, you come here.
Come here.

38:58.218 --> 38:59.918
Hey, you want to hear
something funny?

38:59.920 --> 39:00.936
Mm-hmm.

39:00.938 --> 39:03.271
One year ago today,
almost to the minute,

39:03.273 --> 39:05.590
I was sitting
at this very table

39:05.592 --> 39:07.059
right in that seat.

39:08.227 --> 39:10.395
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

39:10.397 --> 39:12.864
Nursing your gin and tonic
with three extra limes,

39:12.866 --> 39:14.683
doing the crossword,

39:14.685 --> 39:17.268
probably being
all showboat-y about it.

39:17.270 --> 39:18.170
I wasn't being
showboat-y about it.

39:18.172 --> 39:21.206
"Vesuvius""
Boo-yah!

39:22.875 --> 39:24.960
Oh, wait, that doesn't fit.

39:24.962 --> 39:27.262
The point is,
one year ago today,

39:27.264 --> 39:30.832
I made a promise to myself
right at this table.

39:30.834 --> 39:32.901
THE MOTHER:
What was the promise?

39:32.903 --> 39:37.439
BOTH TEDS: I'm coming back,
and I'm bringing you.

39:37.441 --> 39:39.408
Wait a second.
Hold it.

39:39.410 --> 39:42.678
One year ago today,
you hadn't even met me.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.846
I know, but I knew I would.

39:45.882 --> 39:47.649
And now it's a year later.

39:47.651 --> 39:49.317
And here I am.

39:49.319 --> 39:50.669
Here you are.

39:50.671 --> 39:52.104
Love in your eyes,

39:52.106 --> 39:53.989
baked goods
in your undergarments.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.023
Yeah.

39:55.025 --> 39:57.292
You picked a real winner, Mosby.

39:57.294 --> 40:00.045
I did.

40:01.514 --> 40:03.331
Okay, seriously, what the crap

40:03.333 --> 40:05.350
is taking so long
with these rooms?

40:05.352 --> 40:07.285
It was like this
last year.

40:07.287 --> 40:09.004
I'll be right back.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.373
I'll be right here.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.396
Sorry that took so long.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.362
Please...

40:32.364 --> 40:34.197
try to enjoy your stay.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.166
I will.

40:36.168 --> 40:37.316
Try to.

40:37.318 --> 40:41.037
I will enjoy my stay.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.154
Try.

40:42.156 --> 40:43.790
Not gonna try.

40:43.792 --> 40:46.960
Just... just gonna do it.

40:46.962 --> 40:47.994
Good for you.

40:47.996 --> 40:49.012
Not good for me.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.398
No, just-just neutral for me.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.051
Attaboy.
No, at not a boy.

40:57.721 --> 40:58.855
It gets better.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.274
I am fine, Curtis. Okay?

41:01.276 --> 41:04.394
I enjoy and appreciate
the happiness of other people

41:04.396 --> 41:08.131
whether I am in a relationship
or not. Okay? Curtis?

41:08.133 --> 41:09.315
So just-just...

41:09.317 --> 41:11.784
just go ahead
and give me my one key

41:11.786 --> 41:13.820
because I am fine.

41:24.771 --> 41:26.989
Oh, come on!
I need another drink.
