WEBVTT

00:02.843 --> 00:04.502
This is it, Elliot. Today is the day.

00:04.502 --> 00:06.074
I'm doing this. I am definitely doing this.

00:06.075 --> 00:07.568
And you're gonna be wonderful.

00:07.569 --> 00:08.640
What are you doing?

00:09.473 --> 00:10.878
Telling Gabi how I feel about her.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.342
Eww.

00:12.915 --> 00:15.434
Cooper's flies in tonight, so I
gotta get to her before he does.

00:15.435 --> 00:17.580
I've watched all of her
favorite rom-coms as inspiration.

00:17.581 --> 00:19.355
I know how Harry met Sally, and I know

00:19.356 --> 00:21.030
why they're sleepless in Seattle,

00:21.439 --> 00:23.674
what I can't figure out is
how to tell Gabi I love her.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.143
- Why don't you tell her that?
- What?

00:25.144 --> 00:26.979
That speech. It was beautiful.

00:26.980 --> 00:28.515
It was kind of beautiful.

00:28.516 --> 00:30.185
Come on, let's do this.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.566
You're not coming with me.

00:31.567 --> 00:33.936
I know. I want you to
drop me off at Alan's.

00:34.453 --> 00:36.206
He said he had something big to show me.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.976
And the last time he did
that, I was smiling for a week.

00:43.150 --> 00:45.052
I should probably throw on some pants.

00:45.053 --> 00:46.588
I'll help.

00:52.025 --> 00:54.236
Good morning.

00:54.862 --> 00:56.998
Thank you so much for
letting Cooper live here.

00:56.999 --> 00:58.758
Ah, stay here.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.716
Right, stay here until he gets a job.

01:02.717 --> 01:04.589
The point is, we're living together.

01:04.590 --> 01:06.818
Ah-ha... staying together.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.363
(Phone dings)

01:11.567 --> 01:13.153
Oh my God, it's him.

01:13.154 --> 01:14.501
He'll be here any minute.

01:15.010 --> 01:17.322
Oh my God, he'll be here any minute!

01:17.618 --> 01:20.861
How am I gonna have time to put
on all my makeup so I look natural?

01:21.003 --> 01:23.456
- (Knocks on door)
- It's him. Aah!

01:27.099 --> 01:28.963
I'm super Cooper bear,

01:29.217 --> 01:32.312
- and I can't wait to put my paws on...
- Okay, it's Sofia.

01:32.465 --> 01:33.799
Hi.

01:35.676 --> 01:38.018
Cooper, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:38.019 --> 01:39.951
The last time you were
here, you promised me

01:39.952 --> 01:41.708
that you would tell Gabi that
Josh had feelings for her.

01:41.709 --> 01:43.177
You begged me to let you tell her,

01:43.178 --> 01:45.182
and I was sensitive to your feelings.

01:45.737 --> 01:48.840
I was about to tell her, and then
she told me that she loved me.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.208
What was I supposed to say to that?

01:50.208 --> 01:52.377
"I love you too. By the way, so does Josh"?

01:53.145 --> 01:55.533
Okay, I'm gonna give you one last chance.

01:55.534 --> 01:58.115
If you don't tell her by the
end of the day, I'm gonna.

01:59.663 --> 02:01.975
I thought the T.S.A. was rough.

02:02.702 --> 02:04.737
(Knocks on door)

02:08.393 --> 02:10.136
Both: What are you doing here?

02:11.012 --> 02:14.048
I came from China to live with Gabi.

02:14.048 --> 02:15.617
Your turn.

02:15.617 --> 02:19.617
I came from my house to talk to Gabi.

02:19.808 --> 02:22.411
Oh, interesting. And you
used the front door this time,

02:22.412 --> 02:25.218
- not the fire escape?
- Hmm?

02:25.219 --> 02:28.722
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

02:28.723 --> 02:29.925
I know. I know it all,

02:29.926 --> 02:31.838
including the fact that you love Gabi,

02:31.839 --> 02:33.994
which you lied to me about
and told me you didn't.

02:33.995 --> 02:35.241
What? How do you...?

02:35.242 --> 02:36.764
What?

02:37.890 --> 02:39.404
Sofia accidentally told me.

02:39.405 --> 02:42.041
So I know everything. No secrets.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.769
All right, does Gabi know?

02:44.770 --> 02:46.027
Okay, one secret.

02:46.327 --> 02:48.746
Which means you didn't tell
her. Why didn't you tell her?

02:48.747 --> 02:50.385
Because you're scared if she
finds out I have feelings for her,

02:50.385 --> 02:53.221
she'll choose me. (Chuckles) Me.

02:54.051 --> 02:55.721
Will she, though?

02:56.805 --> 02:59.154
Because I'm pretty sure when
she asked me to live here

02:59.155 --> 03:02.330
and told me she loved me,
it 'cause she chose me.

03:04.098 --> 03:05.525
Me.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.454
Hey, Cooper, I just rolled out of...

03:08.542 --> 03:10.858
Josh, what are you here for?

03:11.573 --> 03:14.475
Ha! I'll tell you what I'm not
here for... an interrogation.

03:40.697 --> 03:42.003
You know what makes me sick?

03:42.004 --> 03:45.121
It's that she never would have even
met Cooper if it wasn't for me, damn it.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.048
I gotta figure out my next move.

03:50.048 --> 03:51.883
How about the windows?

03:53.452 --> 03:55.454
Yolanda, I'm serious.

03:55.739 --> 03:56.877
What am I gonna do?

03:57.088 --> 03:59.195
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

03:59.389 --> 04:01.558
Nothing. Cooper just got back.

04:01.559 --> 04:04.089
Gabi's all hot and bothered and into him.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.159
But the boy's got no job,

04:06.209 --> 04:08.279
and three people in that tiny apartment...

04:08.460 --> 04:11.479
watch how fast that
bloom falls off that rose.

04:13.071 --> 04:15.944
How am I gonna make it through
a whole day without seeing you?

04:15.945 --> 04:18.974
I guess I'll just have to give
you something to remember me by.

04:19.576 --> 04:21.581
Oh my damn.

04:22.232 --> 04:25.183
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

04:25.183 --> 04:27.252
Hey, guys. Didn't see you there.

04:27.674 --> 04:30.099
Josh, we didn't have a chance
to catch up this morning.

04:30.374 --> 04:31.823
How are you doing, buddy?

04:31.823 --> 04:33.464
Still filthy rich. How about you, Cooper?

04:34.064 --> 04:35.927
Other than a little tired

04:35.927 --> 04:38.227
from having so much sex, can't complain.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.744
Well, I hope you're not too tired.

04:40.745 --> 04:43.005
I hear looking for work can be exhausting.

04:43.006 --> 04:46.137
Of course, I wouldn't know.
I usually do the hiring.

04:46.137 --> 04:47.739
Actually, I could easily get a job,

04:47.739 --> 04:49.186
'cause I'm, you know, a genius.

04:49.187 --> 04:51.129
But I can't take a tech job for six months

04:51.130 --> 04:53.243
because I have a non-compete
clause from my last company.

04:53.244 --> 04:55.025
So there's just really no point

04:55.026 --> 04:57.525
in competing, Josh.

04:59.251 --> 05:00.976
Yeah, but Cooper can get freelance stuff.

05:00.977 --> 05:03.820
That's why I gave him my car. He's
gonna go out to look for a job today.

05:04.058 --> 05:05.801
No job and no car?

05:05.802 --> 05:08.059
Ha! I give it a week.

05:08.613 --> 05:09.493
Well,

05:10.060 --> 05:13.797
Alan showed me his big surprise.

05:13.798 --> 05:16.400
He liquidated his retirement account

05:16.401 --> 05:18.870
and bought a karaoke bar.

05:19.170 --> 05:22.707
I'm gay and Asian, and still
think that's a stupid idea.

05:24.442 --> 05:27.585
Hey, I think it's exciting
he's following his dream.

05:27.586 --> 05:30.535
Ooh, Alan should hire Cooper
to do all the technical stuff.

05:30.536 --> 05:32.538
I did put on a laser show at my prom.

05:32.682 --> 05:34.551
It was way better than actually going.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.818
And Cooper worked for Josh

05:37.819 --> 05:39.537
and he did a great job. Right, Josh?

05:39.675 --> 05:40.968
Yes.

05:41.887 --> 05:42.905
Fine.

05:43.049 --> 05:44.646
But I hope you work as cheap

05:44.647 --> 05:47.092
as your girlfriend looks in that outfit.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.493
Cheaper.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.805
Ringy-dingy! I got your lunch thingy.

05:57.895 --> 06:00.588
I put crinkle cut potato chips in
the sandwich just like you like...

06:00.589 --> 06:02.591
- just my little way of saying...
- I love you.

06:02.614 --> 06:03.782
- What?
- Nothing.

06:04.687 --> 06:06.105
Oh, okay.

06:06.106 --> 06:07.886
Well, I'm gonna head back to the kitchen.

06:07.886 --> 06:08.955
I love you.

06:10.722 --> 06:12.001
Okay, just to clarify...

06:12.002 --> 06:14.647
are you speaking to me or the sandwich?

06:16.561 --> 06:18.479
Gabi, I've been waiting for the right time

06:18.480 --> 06:21.833
to tell you this. Not sure this is it.

06:24.229 --> 06:25.697
But I love you.

06:29.333 --> 06:30.467
Why are you laughing?

06:30.468 --> 06:32.549
I don't know what to say.

06:33.263 --> 06:34.371
How about,

06:35.315 --> 06:37.217
"I love you too, Josh"?

06:39.964 --> 06:41.507
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:41.508 --> 06:44.639
Ah... that's super sweet
and super flattering.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.036
So I'm going to say thank you

06:47.037 --> 06:49.346
and head back to the kitchen.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.411
So enjoy your lunch.

06:55.672 --> 06:57.555
Okay, now that I had a
moment to think about it,

06:57.556 --> 06:59.658
quick question: Where the
hell did that come from?

06:59.659 --> 07:01.235
I mean, suddenly, out of the clear blue,

07:01.236 --> 07:03.097
you tell me something
like that? I mean, why now?

07:03.098 --> 07:04.279
Why now?

07:06.141 --> 07:08.810
Of course.

07:08.816 --> 07:11.448
'Cause I'm with Cooper.
And it's driving you crazy

07:11.448 --> 07:12.891
because you're so competitive.

07:12.892 --> 07:14.791
To you, I'm just a trophy to win.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.120
Well, guess what. I'm no prize.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.580
Okay, all right, I am a prize,

07:19.581 --> 07:21.024
but not yours.

07:21.025 --> 07:22.434
Enjoy your lunch.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.335
I mean, how dare you, you know?

07:25.336 --> 07:26.938
I'm happier than I've ever been.

07:26.939 --> 07:28.216
And you say something like this

07:28.217 --> 07:30.374
to try and mess with my
head. Well, guess what.

07:30.375 --> 07:33.399
My head is not messed. In
fact, it's clearer than ever.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.301
I love Cooper.

07:38.879 --> 07:40.554
Hmm, thought she was coming back.

07:46.116 --> 07:48.966
Oh my God, Sofia, I had
the craziest day at work.

07:48.967 --> 07:50.509
I brought Josh in a sandwich for lunch

07:50.510 --> 07:52.388
and then all of a sudden
he said "I love you."

07:52.389 --> 07:54.091
Yes!

07:55.392 --> 07:57.895
That is a crazy day at work.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.464
You must have been totally
shocked. Did my name come up?

08:00.464 --> 08:02.266
No. Why would your name come up?

08:02.267 --> 08:04.305
Because I'm your best friend
and you tell me everything,

08:04.306 --> 08:05.596
so tell me everything.

08:06.198 --> 08:07.930
Okay, you're never gonna believe this,

08:07.931 --> 08:10.734
but when he told me that
he loved me, I felt nothing.

08:11.036 --> 08:12.475
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

08:12.476 --> 08:13.887
Do you know how good
it felt to feel nothing?

08:13.888 --> 08:15.800
- I mean, you know how into him I was.
- Uh-huh.

08:15.801 --> 08:18.237
But now it's gone. It's
totally gone. I love Cooper.

08:18.238 --> 08:19.941
Oh my God, I'm off the hook.

08:21.175 --> 08:22.975
We're off the hook. You're off the hook.

08:22.976 --> 08:24.855
This is off the hook!

08:24.856 --> 08:27.694
Okay, I'm gonna go change to
have dinner with the man I love...

08:27.695 --> 08:29.488
Cooper, not Josh. Yay!

08:29.489 --> 08:30.973
Hell yay!

08:32.863 --> 08:34.855
Oh, are those for me?

08:35.061 --> 08:36.462
No, they're for Gabi,

08:36.558 --> 08:38.441
because you're making me
tell her about Josh tonight.

08:38.442 --> 08:39.909
Well, they should be for me,

08:39.910 --> 08:42.145
because I'm about to
tell you some great news.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.116
You don't have to tell
her about Josh tonight.

08:44.595 --> 08:45.861
Oh, why, you ask?

08:45.861 --> 08:47.663
Because today

08:47.663 --> 08:50.281
he told her he loves her. Isn't that great?

08:51.834 --> 08:53.264
How is that great?

08:53.265 --> 08:55.586
Honestly, that makes
me want to punch a wall.

08:55.587 --> 08:57.101
Okay, calm down, macho.

08:57.102 --> 08:58.902
I've seen your pokemon toothbrush.

09:00.142 --> 09:02.444
Look, it's great because, first of all,

09:02.445 --> 09:04.344
she doesn't love him. She loves you.

09:04.345 --> 09:06.847
And second of all, we don't gotta tell her.

09:07.066 --> 09:08.685
We don't have to tell...

09:09.059 --> 09:10.120
we don't have to tell her!

09:10.121 --> 09:11.878
Yeah, but if you keep
screaming it, we will.

09:12.554 --> 09:14.045
Sorry, sorry. This is great.

09:14.046 --> 09:16.815
If the secret is no longer a secret,
we're not keeping anything from her.

09:16.816 --> 09:18.860
The right thing got done, and
we didn't have to tell her.

09:18.861 --> 09:20.460
- It's like a gift.
- It is like a gift.

09:20.461 --> 09:22.663
And so much better than that stupid bear.

09:37.832 --> 09:40.150
(Knocks) Hi.

09:40.151 --> 09:42.220
Josh, what are you doing here?
You scared me half to death.

09:42.221 --> 09:45.076
Look, I've been thinking about what
happened this afternoon. We need to talk.

09:45.077 --> 09:46.819
No, I said everything
I needed to say already.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.489
All right, Cooper is sleeping
right there. You need to go.

09:50.371 --> 09:51.947
The nerve of this guy.

09:55.857 --> 09:57.125
Here you go.

09:57.126 --> 09:58.401
(Screams)

09:59.240 --> 10:00.648
Oh my God.

10:00.648 --> 10:02.245
This is a dream. I'm dreaming.

10:02.246 --> 10:03.852
Why am I dreaming about Josh?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.152
'Cause you have feelings for me.

10:05.989 --> 10:07.658
No, I don't.

10:07.659 --> 10:10.058
You have to leave. I don't
have feelings for you.

10:10.059 --> 10:11.372
I love Cooper.

10:12.566 --> 10:14.568
- Do you really want me to leave?
- Yes.

10:26.023 --> 10:27.525
Told you you loved me.

10:27.526 --> 10:28.827
(Gasps)

10:28.828 --> 10:31.297
No, I don't want you
here. You have to leave.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.134
Really?

10:32.809 --> 10:34.811
Then why are you about to kiss me?

10:35.949 --> 10:36.449
(Gasps)

10:36.450 --> 10:38.852
What? Is there fire? Are there clowns?

10:40.937 --> 10:43.506
No, I... I... I just had a bad dream.

10:43.507 --> 10:45.605
What happened? You want to talk about it?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.293
No, I'm good.

10:47.721 --> 10:48.922
I'm good.

10:55.293 --> 10:56.842
Look how great the sign turned out.

10:56.843 --> 10:59.279
We are now officially the "me sing?

10:59.280 --> 11:02.216
I could never. Ok!" Karaoke bar.

11:02.742 --> 11:04.714
Yay.

11:04.715 --> 11:06.904
Okay, enough. What's
with all the fake yays?

11:06.905 --> 11:08.677
It's like sex with my first boyfriend.

11:09.067 --> 11:11.302
I'm just concerned.

11:11.302 --> 11:13.872
Either the bar fails and you're sad,

11:13.872 --> 11:15.654
or it succeeds,

11:15.655 --> 11:18.275
and then you own a karaoke bar.

11:18.558 --> 11:20.020
(Cooper over speakers) Fear not.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.264
This bar shall flourish.

11:22.347 --> 11:25.235
See? Told you I was one
of the chosen people.

11:26.166 --> 11:28.173
Hey, Coopy, are the lights all hooked up?

11:28.174 --> 11:30.176
Yep. You guys ready for a demo?

11:32.486 --> 11:34.073
- Expensive.
- It's like a rainbow.

11:34.074 --> 11:35.347
I'm dying.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.073
All right, I gotta run
out and grab a few things.

11:38.092 --> 11:40.324
Oh, hey, you want me to pick
up a couple of disco balls?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.712
What do you think?

11:44.650 --> 11:46.793
Alan, I'm just worried
you'll lose all your money.

11:46.794 --> 11:49.238
Elliot, this is my
dream and it's happening.

11:49.239 --> 11:50.655
The boat's leaving the dock.

11:50.656 --> 11:53.362
You can either wave goodbye or
get in the boat and help me row.

11:53.584 --> 11:55.419
Ugh, it's a rowboat?

11:56.765 --> 11:58.188
Fine, but you row.

11:58.296 --> 12:00.803
I'll go sip a cosmo adorably at the bar.

12:01.973 --> 12:04.160
I am so excited that you asked me

12:04.161 --> 12:05.963
to cater your opening night, Alan.

12:06.024 --> 12:08.899
Ooh, boneless chicken wings.

12:09.099 --> 12:11.849
It's adorable how you made
them look like little penises.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.739
They're microphones.

12:15.006 --> 12:16.474
Oh.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.705
'Cause of the singing.

12:19.373 --> 12:21.596
That makes a lot more sense.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.090
You know, I'm... I'm
sure they're delicious,

12:24.091 --> 12:25.846
but I'm too nervous to eat.

12:25.847 --> 12:28.749
Oh, why are you nervous?
The bar looks great.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.707
Elliot and I have been at
such odds over this place.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.110
I want opening night to be perfect,

12:34.111 --> 12:35.327
just like Elliot.

12:35.434 --> 12:37.670
You know, he's the one.

12:37.671 --> 12:41.408
Oh yeah, the one that makes
me cry in the laundry room.

12:42.035 --> 12:44.398
Um, Alan. Can I ask you a question?

12:44.399 --> 12:46.488
How do you know which one is the one,

12:46.489 --> 12:48.920
especially if there could be two

12:48.921 --> 12:50.122
that are both the one?

12:50.234 --> 12:51.468
No, Gabelah,

12:51.469 --> 12:53.338
there can only be one "the one."

12:54.218 --> 12:55.902
Exactly. I mean, then... How do you know?

12:55.903 --> 12:58.105
It's simple. It's the kiss.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.980
I remember when I kissed
Elliot for the first time.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.020
We were in college.

13:02.021 --> 13:04.090
I'd had one and a half Zimas,

13:04.091 --> 13:06.791
and I was feeling really loose,

13:06.792 --> 13:08.577
so I just went for it.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.870
That kiss made my toes curl.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.469
That's the only way you know.

13:13.787 --> 13:16.490
So "one potato, two potato" is out?

13:21.163 --> 13:23.065
Gabi, look, I'm glad you came by.

13:23.066 --> 13:25.001
I don't think we finished our conv...

13:26.906 --> 13:28.407
Enjoy your beer.

13:32.167 --> 13:32.977
Hey!

13:33.278 --> 13:34.417
Josh, I'm really sorry.

13:34.418 --> 13:36.148
I know that came as a shock, but... (Gasps)

13:58.269 --> 13:59.971
Gabi, I got your text. What's up, baby?

13:59.971 --> 14:02.058
Thanks for coming. Uh,
Sofia's stuck at work

14:02.059 --> 14:03.519
and I really needed to talk to somebody.

14:03.783 --> 14:05.276
In the laundry room?

14:05.276 --> 14:07.824
Yeah, I'm... I'm hiding
out in here from Cooper

14:07.989 --> 14:09.624
and life.

14:09.662 --> 14:10.918
What's wrong, baby?

14:10.919 --> 14:12.319
Well, I have a dilemma.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.806
Cooper moved in upstairs

14:13.807 --> 14:17.962
and now I'm starting to feel
things for Josh downstairs.

14:18.639 --> 14:19.988
Oh my damn.

14:20.554 --> 14:21.775
Go on.

14:22.168 --> 14:23.931
Josh told me that he loved me.

14:24.443 --> 14:26.522
And I didn't think that I
had any feelings for him,

14:26.523 --> 14:28.469
but it turns out, I do.
And so I talked to Alan,

14:28.470 --> 14:29.713
and he said the only way to find out

14:29.714 --> 14:31.486
if those feelings are real, is to kiss him.

14:31.487 --> 14:34.156
And so I did. And,
Yolanda, that kiss was...

14:34.157 --> 14:35.558
Amazing.

14:36.089 --> 14:37.244
Well, it was for me,

14:37.245 --> 14:39.213
so it had to be for her too, right?

14:39.893 --> 14:40.894
Well,

14:40.980 --> 14:43.482
there's only one way for
me to answer that question.

14:46.741 --> 14:48.061
Elliot.

14:48.648 --> 14:50.909
I mean, she had to be into it.

14:50.910 --> 14:53.598
And the second kiss... I felt that...

14:53.599 --> 14:56.302
In my toes. In my toes, Yolanda.

14:56.303 --> 14:57.865
But... you know, I have Cooper,

14:57.866 --> 14:59.891
who quit his job in
China to be here with me.

14:59.892 --> 15:02.043
And he's so sweet and caring and wonderful.

15:02.044 --> 15:03.545
And how could I pick Josh over him?

15:03.963 --> 15:05.632
How could she pick Cooper over me?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.980
I mean, I'm a catch.

15:08.146 --> 15:10.321
I'm smart. I'm successful.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.652
And, might I say, I can be...

15:12.653 --> 15:14.957
A little arrogant

15:15.608 --> 15:18.052
if he thinks he can just sleep
with half of San Francisco

15:18.053 --> 15:19.509
and then say, "I love you, Gabi,"

15:19.510 --> 15:21.445
and I'll be like "Okay, Josh."

15:22.509 --> 15:23.333
But?

15:23.334 --> 15:25.801
But, ah, it's just there, you know...

15:25.802 --> 15:27.737
that chemistry and that passion...

15:27.738 --> 15:28.877
That electricity.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.121
You can't deny it.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.767
I can't deny it. What am I gonna do?

15:33.788 --> 15:35.325
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, baby.

15:35.326 --> 15:37.603
I'm biased. I love Josh.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.437
I'm biased. I hate Gabi.

15:40.266 --> 15:43.164
But I love you, so good luck.

15:43.664 --> 15:45.318
Thanks, man.

15:45.511 --> 15:46.824
So what are you gonna do?

15:47.336 --> 15:48.917
The mature thing, you know.

15:48.918 --> 15:51.311
I'm gonna hide down here until
it's time to go to the karaoke bar

15:51.312 --> 15:53.728
and just hope that an
answer magically comes to me.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.896
You know what I'd do in your situation?

15:57.569 --> 15:58.911
Put a couple of quarters in

15:58.911 --> 16:01.134
and ride the spin cycle.

16:01.838 --> 16:02.867
Hey.

16:08.111 --> 16:09.714
Hey, Josh. Need a drink?

16:09.715 --> 16:11.584
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool. Bar's over there.

16:13.197 --> 16:14.922
Ooh, "Total Eclipse of the Heart."

16:14.923 --> 16:16.458
That's, like, my jam.

16:16.459 --> 16:17.744
We should do a duet.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.563
I'm more of a solo act.

16:23.264 --> 16:24.645
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:25.230 --> 16:27.192
Um, appetizer?

16:27.399 --> 16:29.602
Yeah, ah thanks.

16:30.529 --> 16:31.997
They're not penises.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.767
I didn't think they were.

16:36.431 --> 16:37.486
They're little microphones, right?

16:37.487 --> 16:39.259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because of the karaoke

16:39.259 --> 16:40.895
and the singing. Yeah.

16:41.061 --> 16:42.696
- I'm gonna go.
- I'm gonna stay.

16:44.464 --> 16:47.601
I'm so happy. You're all mine now.

16:48.318 --> 16:49.302
What?

16:49.302 --> 16:52.716
- I mean, you're done serving food?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, right. All yours.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.845
Hello, everyone.

16:55.846 --> 16:57.814
Welcome to the grand opening of

16:57.815 --> 16:59.857
"Me sing? I could never. Ok!"

17:00.280 --> 17:02.649
This has been my lifelong dream.

17:02.649 --> 17:06.390
And I couldn't have done it without
my other lifelong dream... Elliot Park.

17:06.391 --> 17:08.355
That's me. I'm a dream weaver.

17:09.101 --> 17:12.626
You know, I did a really
stupid thing 20 years ago.

17:12.721 --> 17:14.057
I found the man of my dreams,

17:14.058 --> 17:16.060
and I never told him how I felt about him.

17:16.173 --> 17:17.921
Why? I had a million excuses.

17:17.922 --> 17:20.317
I was afraid of rejection.
It was never the right time.

17:20.318 --> 17:21.871
I had a girlfriend.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.213
So we never got together.

17:25.292 --> 17:28.296
I could kick myself for not
telling you how I felt back then

17:28.366 --> 17:30.586
when I knew in my heart
you were the only one.

17:30.944 --> 17:33.123
Well, we can't go back,

17:33.297 --> 17:35.683
but I learned something really important:

17:35.834 --> 17:38.442
I'm never gonna be that stupid again.

17:38.443 --> 17:39.776
Elliot Park,

17:41.813 --> 17:43.115
will you marry me?

17:43.116 --> 17:44.422
Oh my God.

17:44.423 --> 17:46.592
Oh my God. For me?

17:46.593 --> 17:47.713
I hope it fits.

17:47.714 --> 17:49.651
I have hands like little starfish.

17:50.212 --> 17:51.762
Yes or no? My knees aren't the best.

17:51.893 --> 17:54.896
- Yes.
- (Cheering)

18:06.521 --> 18:07.183
Hey.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.095
Is everything okay?

18:09.096 --> 18:10.097
No.

18:10.098 --> 18:11.700
Do you want me to leave you alone?

18:11.701 --> 18:12.835
No.

18:15.467 --> 18:18.034
I was really, really
happy that Cooper was here.

18:18.035 --> 18:19.617
(Over speakers) And then
you told me that you loved me

18:19.618 --> 18:20.982
and everything got confused.

18:20.982 --> 18:22.712
And then I kissed you and you kissed me

18:22.713 --> 18:23.912
and then I got even more confused.

18:23.913 --> 18:25.482
And then I heard Alan's speech.

18:26.252 --> 18:28.388
I'm not confused anymore.

18:29.123 --> 18:30.234
Josh,

18:30.964 --> 18:32.182
it's you.

18:35.611 --> 18:37.061
No, wait. Um...

18:37.062 --> 18:38.647
I... I have to talk to Cooper first.

18:38.647 --> 18:40.616
I mean, the last thing I
want to do is embarrass him.

18:40.616 --> 18:41.660
Cooper: Too late.

18:45.154 --> 18:48.087
- Cooper, I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm the one who's sorry.

18:49.191 --> 18:51.331
You want to be with Josh?

18:52.161 --> 18:53.512
Fine.

18:54.019 --> 18:55.918
But you should know something first.

18:56.365 --> 18:57.589
Josh, you want to tell her?

18:57.708 --> 18:58.979
Ah... You know what? Let me.

18:59.047 --> 19:01.068
- Cooper, don't.
- Don't "don't" me.

19:02.570 --> 19:05.763
Gabi, before you fall for
Josh's big "I love you,"

19:06.064 --> 19:08.723
you should know that he thought
he loved you three months ago,

19:08.941 --> 19:10.946
right before he called off his wedding.

19:11.852 --> 19:12.940
Oh, yeah.

19:12.941 --> 19:15.090
And he told everybody but you,

19:15.204 --> 19:16.858
and then, when he changed his mind,

19:16.859 --> 19:18.928
convinced everyone to lie to you about it.

19:18.929 --> 19:20.397
Yolanda lied. Elliot lied.

19:20.398 --> 19:23.535
Even Sofia lied, only after being
bought off with a new cell phone.

19:23.536 --> 19:25.078
Which brings us to today,

19:26.109 --> 19:28.380
when all of a sudden he loves you again

19:29.409 --> 19:31.110
now that we're together.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.310
I wonder how long it'll last this time.

19:37.950 --> 19:41.950
Anyway, I, ah... I wish you all the best.

19:43.472 --> 19:45.481
See? I can lie too.

19:49.118 --> 19:50.272
Is it true?

19:51.166 --> 19:53.510
- Gabi, I can explain everything.
- Oh my God, it is true.

19:53.511 --> 19:55.604
- Gabi, wait.
- No, get the hell away from me.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.199
Okay, next up we have Josie

20:02.200 --> 20:04.007
singing "Hungry Like the Wolf."

20:11.077 --> 20:12.495
Thank God I didn't pay retail

20:12.496 --> 20:14.475
for that styrofoam heart.

20:15.336 --> 20:16.737
I'm sorry.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.772
I wanted tonight to be perfect for you.

20:18.772 --> 20:20.306
It was.

20:20.307 --> 20:23.242
And not just because Gabi
ran out of here crying.

20:23.824 --> 20:25.686
My ring is beautiful.

20:25.687 --> 20:29.391
It's a tiny bow tie, 'cause
you're my tiny bow tie.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.582
I'm sorry I was so bitchy
about you buying this place.

20:35.626 --> 20:38.367
I was wrong. This place is packed.

20:38.368 --> 20:40.192
