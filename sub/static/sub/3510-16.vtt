00:01.315 --> 00:02.462
Previously on "Castle"...

00:02.463 --> 00:05.035
Hands in the air.
Thomas Gage, you're under arrest.

00:05.036 --> 00:07.412
Everything that you have on
me, it's all going away.

00:07.413 --> 00:09.501
I'm very interested in
knowing how he got out of

00:09.502 --> 00:11.488
that holding cell on your watch.

00:11.962 --> 00:13.160
Castle...

00:14.619 --> 00:17.061
Rick Castle at a loss for words.

00:17.062 --> 00:18.151
Sophia Turner.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.002
Hello, Rick.

00:19.003 --> 00:21.170
You're Clara strike from
the Derrick Storm books?

00:21.171 --> 00:22.626
Welcome to the CIA.

00:22.627 --> 00:24.529
Gage was our most
effective asset.

00:24.530 --> 00:25.463
He went rogue.

00:25.464 --> 00:28.071
Pandora is the code name
for Gage's mission.

00:28.072 --> 00:28.594
Who is he?

00:28.595 --> 00:29.950
Dr. Nelson Blakely.

00:29.951 --> 00:30.813
There he is.

00:30.814 --> 00:32.262
He was a legend at the agency.

00:32.262 --> 00:35.155
His approach was to
find a small event

00:35.156 --> 00:36.386
that could trigger
a large event.

00:36.387 --> 00:37.958
Blakely is the one
who planned Pandora.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.713
This is beyond a
worst-case scenario.

00:39.714 --> 00:41.694
Dr. Blakely, what's going on?

00:41.695 --> 00:43.350
I found a linchpin

00:43.351 --> 00:46.401
that will bring about the end
of our country as we know it.

00:46.537 --> 00:48.542
- Dr. Blakely--
- They're here.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.487
Wait! Wait!

00:56.973 --> 00:58.933
- Beckett!
- Castle!

01:03.970 --> 01:05.187
This door won't open.

01:07.157 --> 01:08.469
Yeah, mine won't either.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.035
I think the crash
bent the frame.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.400
We need something
to break the glass.

01:11.401 --> 01:12.485
My gun.

01:14.439 --> 01:15.944
Castle, I can't...

01:16.494 --> 01:17.790
I can't find it.

01:18.093 --> 01:20.469
I-I think it got knocked
out when we got hit.

01:20.470 --> 01:21.791
Help me look for it.

01:28.872 --> 01:30.064
I'm stuck.

01:30.429 --> 01:31.234
What do you mean, you're stuck?

01:31.235 --> 01:33.727
I mean, my belt is jammed.

01:34.223 --> 01:35.541
And the seat won't move.

01:38.818 --> 01:40.181
Okay, what about a knife?
Do you have a knife?

01:40.182 --> 01:41.353
Yeah.

01:41.763 --> 01:42.966
In the trunk.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.115 --> 01:54.086
Okay, look, we're
running out of time.

01:54.087 --> 01:56.168
I need you to see if
you can find that gun,

01:56.500 --> 01:58.193
and we'll just shoot
the belt off.

01:59.548 --> 02:00.251
I can't feel it.

02:00.252 --> 02:02.447
- Castle.
- Okay, hang on. Hang on.

02:05.227 --> 02:07.011
Just stay here.

02:30.652 --> 02:31.761
I found it.

03:00.557 --> 03:01.850
Castle?

03:09.319 --> 03:10.651
Castle!

04:28.563 --> 04:29.629
I guess the good thing

04:29.630 --> 04:31.461
about having your daughter
at crime scenes is,

04:31.462 --> 04:33.778
she can bring you dry clothes.

04:35.319 --> 04:36.591
Thanks.

04:36.674 --> 04:38.043
And, um...

04:38.474 --> 04:39.693
thanks.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.537
You'd have done the same for me.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.411
Yeah.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.624
Probably.

04:46.031 --> 04:47.692
I'm just glad you found my gun.

04:49.135 --> 04:50.930
That whole, uh,
sinking car thing--

04:50.931 --> 04:52.800
much cooler in movies
than it is in real life.

04:52.801 --> 04:55.064
And for the record, I prefer
watching spy thrillers

04:55.065 --> 04:55.680
to being in them.

04:55.681 --> 04:57.043
So...

04:57.687 --> 04:58.730
tell me...

04:58.731 --> 05:00.762
how can your victim look
like Nelson Blakely

05:00.763 --> 05:03.028
when he supposedly
died ten years ago?

05:03.029 --> 05:04.211
Yeah, I...

05:04.212 --> 05:05.681
Yeah, weird, isn't it?

05:05.682 --> 05:07.946
Yeah. Weird.

05:07.979 --> 05:09.852
Fake deaths, car in the water--

05:09.853 --> 05:11.076
don't you think now
is a good time

05:11.077 --> 05:12.918
to tell us what the
hell is going on?

05:12.919 --> 05:15.625
Uh... I'm sorry, Javi.

05:15.626 --> 05:17.058
It's classified.

05:18.437 --> 05:19.950
I was Special Forces.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.898
I used to eat classified
for breakfast.

05:21.899 --> 05:23.545
And yet writer boy can know?

05:23.546 --> 05:25.800
Okay. I'll be over there
with harbor patrol

05:25.801 --> 05:29.010
trying to figure out how to get
your unit out of the drink.

05:31.278 --> 05:32.579
I'm glad you're okay.

05:34.603 --> 05:35.951
Thank you.

05:36.857 --> 05:38.153
Writer boy?

05:39.213 --> 05:41.341
- So you think our shooter was Gage?
- Yeah.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.563
I think he's getting
rid of anyone

05:42.564 --> 05:44.338
that could expose his
rogue operations.

05:44.339 --> 05:45.414
Well, he's doing a
pretty good job.

05:45.415 --> 05:47.106
We still have no idea
what Pandora is.

05:47.107 --> 05:48.580
Well, we know that
Blakely was afraid.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.242
And we know that he was
working on something

05:50.243 --> 05:52.357
that was big enough to threaten
the future of this country.

05:52.358 --> 05:55.066
We just don't know what the
hell he was working on.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.007
There's gotta be a clue
somewhere in his life.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.918
Maybe there's something on
the body that will tell us.

05:58.919 --> 06:01.311
No. We checked.
There was nothing in his pockets.

06:01.312 --> 06:03.122
But the way they were
turned out makes me think

06:03.123 --> 06:04.888
someone went through
and emptied them.

06:04.889 --> 06:05.972
Gage.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.892
Ryan, get some teams to
search the building.

06:07.893 --> 06:09.212
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

06:09.213 --> 06:10.942
But he brought us
here for a reason.

06:10.943 --> 06:12.443
Lanie, see what you
can find on him--

06:12.444 --> 06:15.767
dental, scars, prints, tattoos,
anything that might tell us--

06:25.874 --> 06:27.032
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.351
Look, I can explain.

06:28.352 --> 06:29.730
Get in the car.

06:39.062 --> 06:40.844
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

06:41.392 --> 06:42.813
What you wanted,
finding Blakely.

06:42.814 --> 06:45.186
You cracked his code and you
didn't even think to notify me?

06:45.187 --> 06:46.513
Look, in Castle's defense,

06:46.514 --> 06:47.646
it was a long shot,

06:47.647 --> 06:50.013
and he didn't want to waste
your time if he was wrong.

06:50.014 --> 06:51.844
- And we were bringing the guy in--
- When he was killed

06:51.845 --> 06:52.796
in your custody.

06:52.797 --> 06:54.158
What were you doing
at the docks?

06:54.159 --> 06:56.103
- He asked us to take him there.
- Why?

06:56.104 --> 06:57.299
We don't know.

06:57.594 --> 06:59.212
Well, did you learn anything?

06:59.213 --> 07:00.194
Yes.

07:00.195 --> 07:01.759
He was hired to analyze

07:01.760 --> 07:03.984
the United States for
vulnerabilities.

07:03.985 --> 07:06.648
He said he found a
weakness in our economy--

07:06.649 --> 07:09.370
an unexpected linchpin-- that,
if someone went after it,

07:10.088 --> 07:11.290
would start the dominos falling.

07:11.291 --> 07:12.521
Falling toward what?

07:12.522 --> 07:15.521
The end of our country
as we know it.

07:17.374 --> 07:18.127
So what's our next move?

07:18.128 --> 07:19.906
There is no next move.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.597
Not for you two.

07:22.159 --> 07:23.993
It was a mistake bringing
you into the loop.

07:23.994 --> 07:27.589
You know, I really thought--
I really thought you had changed.

07:27.590 --> 07:28.232
But you know what?

07:28.233 --> 07:30.473
You are the same reckless,

07:30.474 --> 07:33.765
immature, self-centered
jackass that you always were,

07:33.766 --> 07:35.235
and you've put this
investigation at risk.

07:35.236 --> 07:37.454
- Look, I'm sorry--
- You're sorry?

07:37.455 --> 07:39.984
We are on the verge of
the next 9/11 or worse.

07:39.985 --> 07:41.457
This isn't one of your
damn books, Rick.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.540
This is real life, and
when things go bad,

07:43.541 --> 07:46.328
you can't just rewrite the
ending like you did with us.

07:49.547 --> 07:51.038
Get them both out of here.

07:58.098 --> 07:59.303
So...

07:59.507 --> 08:00.741
you slept with her.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.670
Yeah, yeah.

08:03.007 --> 08:04.608
Yeah, I slept with her.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.163
Have there been others?

08:06.164 --> 08:07.966
- Women?
- Muses.

08:07.967 --> 08:09.696
No. Why?

08:11.098 --> 08:13.156
I just wanted to see how big the club was.
That's all.

08:13.157 --> 08:14.022
Hey, guys. What do you got?

08:14.023 --> 08:17.300
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
First off, there is no club.

08:17.301 --> 08:19.912
And second, we're off
the case if you recall.

08:19.913 --> 08:23.474
We're off their case.
I still have a murder to solve.

08:23.475 --> 08:24.839
Where your chief suspect

08:24.840 --> 08:26.899
is smack-dab in the middle
of a CIA operation.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.755
I don't care what he's
in the middle of.

08:28.756 --> 08:32.678
Thomas Gage killed three people.
One of them was in my custody.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.658
He locked us in a trunk

08:33.659 --> 08:35.902
and then he sent my cruiser
to the bottom of the Hudson.

08:35.903 --> 08:38.046
Gage is a trained
covert operative.

08:38.047 --> 08:39.679
There's no way you
can catch him.

08:39.679 --> 08:42.315
Yes, I can, if I figure
out where he was going.

08:42.316 --> 08:44.426
We find out what Blakely
was working on,

08:44.427 --> 08:45.219
we find the linchpin.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.728
We find the linchpin,
we find Gage.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.443
Anything on the warehouse?

08:56.444 --> 08:58.569
Yeah, right after you guys
left, the feds showed up

08:58.570 --> 08:59.421
and shut us down.

08:59.422 --> 09:02.449
But we did find something
on your vic Nelson Blakely.

09:02.450 --> 09:04.104
His prints came back
as a Scott McGregor

09:04.105 --> 09:05.047
from Long Island City.

09:05.048 --> 09:07.333
Problem is, McGregor seems
to only exist on paper.

09:07.334 --> 09:09.009
We can't find any trace
of him in the real world.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.196
Did you guys send units
to the listed address?

09:11.197 --> 09:13.696
Yeah, and the family living
there had never heard of him,

09:13.697 --> 09:15.021
and no one recognized his photo.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.703
Well, someone must
have known him.

09:16.704 --> 09:17.960
Someone did.

09:18.196 --> 09:20.478
He plays chess.
That's not a solo sport.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.041
I thought you were off the case.

09:23.071 --> 09:24.675
Well, you heard
what Sophia said.

09:24.676 --> 09:28.027
I'm a reckless, immature,
self-centered jackass.

09:28.028 --> 09:30.185
If you're stubborn
enough to keep going,

09:30.186 --> 09:32.112
I'm stupid enough
to go with you.

09:33.314 --> 09:35.955
All right. You guys canvass all
of the chess parks in the city.

09:35.956 --> 09:38.395
Let's see if we can dig
up some of his opponents.

09:39.507 --> 09:40.611
Beckett.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.499
What?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.456
What do you mean, the
body never arrived?

09:45.457 --> 09:47.082
They intercepted
it at transport.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.884
Apparently, they
had a court order.

09:49.016 --> 09:50.339
That's impossible.

09:50.374 --> 09:51.834
How could they get a
court order that fast?

09:51.835 --> 09:54.014
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask your girlfriend.

09:54.015 --> 09:54.898
Girlfriend?

09:54.899 --> 09:57.145
Yes, okay. We slept together.

09:57.146 --> 09:59.018
It was a long time ago.
What's the big deal?

09:59.019 --> 10:01.869
There is no big deal.
Sleep with whoever you want.

10:01.870 --> 10:03.661
The more the merrier.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.864
I have those, uh, toxicology
reports you wanted.

10:08.865 --> 10:10.730
Oh, yes.
Just set 'em there, sweetie.

10:10.731 --> 10:11.790
Thank you.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.667
So enjoying your new internship?

10:16.668 --> 10:18.154
Well, I'm learning a lot.

10:18.155 --> 10:19.961
Too much I think.

10:19.962 --> 10:20.904
And I thought the dead bodies

10:20.905 --> 10:22.080
were going to be
the grossest part.

10:22.081 --> 10:23.446
Funny. Good night.

10:23.447 --> 10:25.189
So who was Beckett
talking about?

10:25.190 --> 10:27.407
None of your business.
Now go to bed.

10:27.408 --> 10:29.552
The woman at the
docks, who is she?

10:29.553 --> 10:30.637
Nobody.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.349
Now go to bed.

10:31.350 --> 10:32.869
I saw the way you looked at her.

10:32.870 --> 10:33.872
She's not nobody.

10:33.873 --> 10:36.029
Well, it doesn't matter
who she is because

10:36.030 --> 10:38.193
I am never going
to see her again.

10:38.194 --> 10:39.967
Now go to bed.

10:42.688 --> 10:44.111
You know, if you're going
to keep secrets from me,

10:44.112 --> 10:46.041
I might start keeping
secrets from you, too.

10:46.042 --> 10:48.637
At your age, I'm thinking,
that might be a good idea.

10:55.146 --> 10:56.392
Sophia.

10:56.962 --> 10:58.255

Th--um...

11:12.700 --> 11:14.843
how--what are you--how did--
how did you get in here?

11:14.844 --> 11:16.156
I'm CIA.

11:18.215 --> 11:20.723
So they're turning them
into graphic novels now?

11:20.724 --> 11:22.027
Yeah. Um...

11:22.028 --> 11:24.507
the first one did well, so
they're gonna do another.

11:24.508 --> 11:26.626
So what do you think,
she look like me?

11:26.913 --> 11:29.846
Uh... what are you doing here?

11:33.029 --> 11:35.140
You're going after
Gage, aren't you?

11:37.169 --> 11:38.849
No.
We're off the case, remember?

11:38.850 --> 11:42.012
Mm. You used to be
a better liar.

11:42.013 --> 11:44.939
I know you've been looking
into Blakely's aliases.

11:45.804 --> 11:47.732
It's okay, Rick. I don't mind.

11:48.195 --> 11:50.232
In fact, I want
you on this case.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.106
- But--
- I know what I said,

11:52.107 --> 11:54.141
but I also know what's at stake.

11:54.312 --> 11:55.501
Bringing you and
Beckett on board

11:55.502 --> 11:56.794
was not a popular decision,

11:56.795 --> 12:00.224
and after what happened with
Blakely, I had to make a stand.

12:00.537 --> 12:03.637
But I know what kind
of asset you can be.

12:04.456 --> 12:07.927
I know you'll just keep
digging no matter what I say.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.180
It's your nature.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.724
You need to know how
the story ends.

12:13.326 --> 12:14.847
Like with her.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.413
Does she know about this?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.409
Well, that's...

12:24.169 --> 12:26.625
You always did like
playing with dynamite.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.512
Just be careful it doesn't
blow up in your face.

12:29.513 --> 12:30.339
She's different.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.392
Is she?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.491
Or do you just think she is?

12:40.919 --> 12:43.835
I heard you hit the same dead
end with Blakely as we did.

12:45.488 --> 12:48.506
I thought you might
be able to try this.

12:50.076 --> 12:51.569
It's what Blakely was
looking for at the pier.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.181
We found it in a go bag
with plane tickets, cash,

12:54.182 --> 12:55.756
and some fake IDs.

12:56.171 --> 12:56.799
Account numbers?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.094
All from domestic banks.

12:58.095 --> 12:59.506
And since Blakely was
a US citizen--

12:59.507 --> 13:00.796
You're prohibited from
looking into them.

13:00.797 --> 13:02.649
But you guys aren't.

13:02.770 --> 13:06.088
And those accounts may contain
clues as to who hired him.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.934
And assuming you still want
to know how the story ends...

13:16.020 --> 13:17.843
Just keep me in the
loop this time.

13:17.844 --> 13:18.968
And, Rick...

13:20.222 --> 13:21.827
try not to get killed.

13:23.905 --> 13:25.632
I'm still quite fond of you.

13:41.468 --> 13:42.675
Where are the boys?

13:43.232 --> 13:44.885
They're canvassing chess parks,

13:44.886 --> 13:46.746
looking for anyone
that knew Blakely.

13:46.747 --> 13:48.782
And why aren't you with them?

13:48.783 --> 13:51.002
Because my car is at the
bottom of the Hudson,

13:51.003 --> 13:52.463
and Gates won't issue
me another one

13:52.464 --> 13:53.651
until I write up an
incident report,

13:53.652 --> 13:56.434
which I can't do because
this case is classified.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.030
What?

13:59.031 --> 14:00.148
Nothing.

14:00.552 --> 14:03.531
It's just, that's a perfect
example of a linchpin.

14:03.532 --> 14:05.759
This case might go
unsolved all because

14:05.760 --> 14:07.414
you don't have access to a car.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.112
Don't make me shoot you.

14:10.456 --> 14:11.889
Well, if you shoot me,

14:12.415 --> 14:14.482
who's gonna help you
follow this lead?

14:15.903 --> 14:18.097
Blakely's bank
account information.

14:18.098 --> 14:19.554
It's what he was going
for on the pier.

14:19.555 --> 14:20.452
If we can track his money--

14:20.453 --> 14:21.859
Where did you get that?

14:23.693 --> 14:24.425
Sophia.

14:24.426 --> 14:26.259
She came to my place last night.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.879
- Not like that.
- No, of course.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.561
So then what happened
to "reckless, immature,

14:29.562 --> 14:30.767
self-centered jackass"?

14:30.768 --> 14:33.310
She was posturing
for her colleagues.

14:33.319 --> 14:35.679
Beckett, it's a lead.

14:35.910 --> 14:38.988
She wants us on the case.

14:42.588 --> 14:43.604
What do you think
this is about, huh?

14:43.605 --> 14:45.089
It smells like an
intelligence op.

14:45.090 --> 14:47.244
CIA, NSA, DHS?

14:47.245 --> 14:49.067
Same letters,
different alphabet.

14:49.068 --> 14:50.643
I had some buddies
from the service

14:50.644 --> 14:52.139
volunteer for intelligence ops.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.357
Yeah, how'd they like it?

14:53.358 --> 14:54.677
They all died.

14:56.351 --> 14:59.178
Hey, guys.
Do you recognize this man?

15:00.491 --> 15:02.113
Matter of fact, I do.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.023
Uh, he comes to the park
two or three times a week.

15:07.024 --> 15:08.271
Looks for games.

15:08.272 --> 15:09.803
What do you know about him?

15:09.804 --> 15:11.735
He's a crazy chess player.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.254
Makes some weird moves,

15:13.255 --> 15:15.459
like sacrificing his queen

15:15.460 --> 15:17.236
just to see what happens.

15:17.897 --> 15:19.381
He always wins, though.

15:19.382 --> 15:20.231
Do you know his name?

15:20.232 --> 15:21.749
Scott or something like that.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.677
But i-if you want to
know about this guy,

15:23.678 --> 15:24.999
you should talk to Jani.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.811
Jani? Who's Jani?

15:26.812 --> 15:28.057
Another player.

15:28.058 --> 15:29.765
Him and your guy...

15:30.012 --> 15:32.699
been spending a lot of
time together lately.

15:34.544 --> 15:36.531
So Blakely had over $2 million

15:36.532 --> 15:38.772
in six accounts, and none of
them under his real name.

15:38.773 --> 15:41.034
Deposits were made by
nonprofits, aid groups,

15:41.035 --> 15:42.756
environmental organizations.

15:42.757 --> 15:45.871
So if those were his secret
consulting accounts,

15:45.872 --> 15:47.637
it's possible that one
of those payments

15:47.638 --> 15:48.992
was for operation Pandora.

15:48.993 --> 15:50.608
Exactly. These two.

15:50.609 --> 15:52.832
Deposits of half a
million dollars each.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.199
This one was from
three months ago,

15:54.200 --> 15:56.022
and this one was
from a week ago.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.208
His start and finish payments.

15:57.209 --> 15:59.619
Mm-hmm.
Both from offshore accounts.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.855
But they're closed.
It's a dead end.

16:01.856 --> 16:03.039
Yo.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.072
We may have a lead on Blakely.

16:06.244 --> 16:07.535
Guy in the park said
he's been spending time

16:07.536 --> 16:09.462
with this man-- Janacek Spivey.

16:09.463 --> 16:12.599
2-time national chess champion,
now an Economics professor

16:12.600 --> 16:13.991
at the School of
International Affairs.

16:13.992 --> 16:15.067
An Economics professor?

16:15.068 --> 16:16.361
You think it's related?

16:17.307 --> 16:18.248
Well, I don't know
if this helps,

16:18.249 --> 16:20.725
but the guy is also an
advisor to the IMF,

16:20.726 --> 16:22.684
the UN Economics Council,

16:22.685 --> 16:24.505
and the Congressional
Finance Committee.

16:25.688 --> 16:27.044
Yeah, that's him.

16:27.045 --> 16:30.187
But he said his name was
McGregor, not Blakely.

16:30.188 --> 16:31.545
What do you know about him?

16:31.803 --> 16:34.095
Um, he was a hell
of a chess player.

16:34.292 --> 16:36.825
Uh, it seemed like he knew
every move I was gonna make

16:36.826 --> 16:37.629
before I made it.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.942
No, I mean...

16:39.605 --> 16:40.909
personally.

16:42.796 --> 16:45.634
He never really talked
about his personal life.

16:46.079 --> 16:49.107
Witnesses said you spent a lot
of time talking. What about?

16:49.108 --> 16:50.409
Economic theory.

16:50.739 --> 16:51.883
When he found out what I did,

16:51.884 --> 16:53.457
he had a million questions.

16:53.458 --> 16:54.761
What kind of questions?

16:55.508 --> 16:57.339
About world economic forces,

16:57.496 --> 16:59.908
historic socioeconomic models.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.747
There were times it seemed
like he knew more than I did.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.615
He was quite the hobbyist.

17:04.616 --> 17:06.718
Oh, he was more than
just a hobbyist.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.424
Did he focus on
anything in specific?

17:09.425 --> 17:10.909
Uh, not that I remember.

17:10.910 --> 17:13.146
Though he was very concerned
with the US economy.

17:13.146 --> 17:16.162
And he never mentioned
any family or friends?

17:16.510 --> 17:18.068
- No.
- Anywhere he might have shopped?

17:18.069 --> 17:20.167
Anything that might
indicate where he lived?

17:20.169 --> 17:23.080
No. B-but I think he
lived in Union Square.

17:23.082 --> 17:24.380
And what makes you say that?

17:24.381 --> 17:25.944
After one of our walks,

17:26.281 --> 17:29.006
uh, I discovered I'd left
my chess set in the park.

17:30.654 --> 17:32.979
I saw him head into
a building there.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.994
Do you think you can identify
that building for us?

17:34.995 --> 17:36.292
I think so.

17:38.292 --> 17:39.316
I gotta borrow your car.

17:39.317 --> 17:40.600
Yeah.

17:42.468 --> 17:44.797
Uh, yeah, this is his
place right here.

17:46.296 --> 17:49.670
But he said his name was Finley,
not Blakely or McGregor.

17:50.531 --> 17:52.171
Thanks.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.111
What are we looking for?

17:56.112 --> 17:59.310
Papers, computers,
phone records, bills--

17:59.311 --> 18:01.094
anything that'll help us
figure out what he was up to.

18:03.969 --> 18:05.269
Beckett.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.498
Think I found it.

18:21.082 --> 18:22.740
What the hell?

18:39.967 --> 18:41.262
"Tax riots."

18:41.391 --> 18:43.240
"European economic collapse."

18:43.241 --> 18:44.723
"Iran invades Iraq!"

18:44.724 --> 18:46.855
"Syria moves on Israel."

18:47.060 --> 18:48.932
"US commits troops to Taiwan."

18:48.933 --> 18:50.949
"US commits troops
to Middle East."

18:51.099 --> 18:53.199
"Russia moves on
Eastern Europe."

18:56.363 --> 18:59.119
What kind of an outcome was this
linchpin supposed to create?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.099
The end of our country
as we know it.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.699
A Third World War.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.100
This can't be real.

19:19.101 --> 19:21.306
No one can predict all of this.

19:21.689 --> 19:22.432
Maybe not,

19:22.433 --> 19:25.098
but a bunch of people smarter
than us think he can

19:25.188 --> 19:27.061
and would kill to cover it up.

19:30.452 --> 19:33.411
I found an alarming
vulnerability...

19:33.708 --> 19:34.828
Over here.

19:34.829 --> 19:37.945
A linchpin that was
tied to the economy

19:37.946 --> 19:40.335
that would cause
crisis and devastation

19:40.336 --> 19:42.442
beyond anything we'd ever seen.

19:42.518 --> 19:46.036
The dominos would just
never stop falling.

19:46.238 --> 19:47.471
Who is she?

19:47.472 --> 19:49.579
I don't know, but this is it.

19:50.386 --> 19:51.770
She's the linchpin.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.712
The first domino to fall that...
leads to war.

19:58.207 --> 19:59.752
I gave them the blueprint

19:59.753 --> 20:02.678
that will bring out the end
of our country as we know it.

20:02.898 --> 20:05.573
I have to call them.
They have to know.

20:05.735 --> 20:07.060
Put the phone down.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.736
- Gage?
- Put the phone down now.

20:10.526 --> 20:11.706
Now run.

20:11.707 --> 20:13.066
- What?
- Run!

20:30.265 --> 20:31.470
I thought you were the bad guy.

20:31.471 --> 20:33.228
If I were the bad guy,
you'd be dead by now.

20:34.152 --> 20:34.821
This way.

20:34.822 --> 20:35.920
No, my car is out front.

20:35.921 --> 20:37.937
They're watching your car.
You go that way, and you'll die.

20:37.938 --> 20:39.395
Who's out there? Who are they?

20:39.701 --> 20:41.340
You can have answers
or you can live.

20:41.819 --> 20:42.820
Your choice.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.057
Stay down!

20:55.058 --> 20:56.593
We need to call our CIA contact.

20:56.594 --> 20:57.455
We need to tell them
what's going on.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.748
No calls.

21:13.838 --> 21:14.634
Where are we?

21:14.635 --> 21:16.905
Someplace safe, but we don't
have much time, all right?

21:16.906 --> 21:18.159
I've been on the grid,
I've heard the chatter.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.209
Whatever this is, it's
going down tomorrow.

21:20.210 --> 21:22.959
Now you got to Blakely's before me.
Who's the target?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.976
Why did you kill
Blakely and McGrath?

21:25.142 --> 21:26.221
I didn't.

21:31.163 --> 21:33.312
Come on. You really want me to
take that gun away from you again?

21:33.313 --> 21:35.786
- We don't have the time.
- Make time.

21:42.721 --> 21:43.989
Look, as an asset,

21:43.990 --> 21:46.852
you have to develop certain
survival skills, all right?

21:46.853 --> 21:48.935
Chief of which is the ability
to know something's wrong

21:48.936 --> 21:50.533
without knowing why.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.176
It's always something small--

21:52.271 --> 21:54.157
a static pop on your
safe house phone,

21:54.158 --> 21:56.824
a slight delay in authorization
using your credit cards,

21:57.561 --> 21:59.194
or the almost
imperceptible pauses

21:59.195 --> 22:01.229
in conversations
with your handler.

22:01.807 --> 22:03.274
Something's wrong,

22:03.284 --> 22:04.757
and if you don't
figure out what,

22:04.758 --> 22:06.564
you're not gonna
survive the week.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.765
Now someone is trying
to send this world

22:08.766 --> 22:09.930
spiraling towards war,

22:09.931 --> 22:11.266
and they want me
to take the fall,

22:11.267 --> 22:13.184
but neither of those
things are gonna happen.

22:13.963 --> 22:16.646
Now I need you to tell me what
the name of the target is.

22:17.582 --> 22:20.024
Look, let me call
my CIA contact.

22:20.112 --> 22:21.308
- She can help us.
- No.

22:21.837 --> 22:24.682
Everything indicates that
Pandora's being funded

22:24.683 --> 22:27.700
by military industrial concerns
linked with eastern Europe.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.740
They can't pull off
this operation,

22:30.989 --> 22:32.805
all right, not without
help from the inside.

22:33.696 --> 22:36.307
Detective, don't you get it?

22:36.951 --> 22:39.162
My own people are setting me up.

22:40.114 --> 22:42.118
And they're not gonna
stop until I'm dead,

22:42.197 --> 22:43.798
because I'm the diversion.

22:44.399 --> 22:46.064
Okay, if everyone's trying
to stop me, then no one--

22:46.065 --> 22:47.815
Then no one's trying
to stop Pandora.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.463
No one but me.

22:50.919 --> 22:53.420
Now I'm gonna ask
you one last time,

22:54.582 --> 22:56.125
who's the target?

23:10.333 --> 23:11.632
Hello, Thomas.

23:22.814 --> 23:25.988
It's the oldest intelligence
con job in the book--

23:25.998 --> 23:28.445
create a crisis so
you can ride in

23:28.446 --> 23:29.459
just in time to save the day.

23:29.460 --> 23:30.427
Gage was playing you.

23:30.428 --> 23:32.045
He wanted you to think
that he was the good guy.

23:32.046 --> 23:33.146
He needed your trust.

23:33.147 --> 23:34.352
Yeah, but then why did he ask us

23:34.353 --> 23:36.430
who the linchpin was?
Shouldn't he have known?

23:36.431 --> 23:37.869
He was protecting his op.

23:37.870 --> 23:40.431
He was ascertaining how much
we knew before he killed you.

23:40.432 --> 23:42.382
Well, if you're right and the
attack on us was staged,

23:42.383 --> 23:43.718
then he can't be working alone.

23:43.719 --> 23:44.812
Gage must have a partner.

23:44.813 --> 23:46.129
Which means it's not over.

23:46.130 --> 23:46.962
Fire crews were unable

23:46.963 --> 23:49.257
to contain the blaze in
Blakely's apartment.

23:49.258 --> 23:50.863
All of his research is gone.

23:51.658 --> 23:52.277
I want you to run this

23:52.278 --> 23:54.045
through every facial
rec database we have.

23:54.046 --> 23:55.953
I want to know who she is and
I want to know how the hell

23:55.954 --> 23:56.996
a 10-year-old girl could be

23:56.997 --> 23:59.079
the first domino in
the march toward war.

23:59.698 --> 24:00.606
Where's Gage?

24:00.607 --> 24:01.680
In the tank.

24:08.606 --> 24:09.340
You know that guy

24:09.341 --> 24:11.417
you threw out the
window-- Gary Harper?

24:12.130 --> 24:13.671
He was a friend.

24:13.914 --> 24:15.707
Then you shouldn't
have sent him for me.

24:18.735 --> 24:20.294
You know, we've met before.

24:22.164 --> 24:23.225
In Berlin,

24:23.606 --> 24:25.033
the Mannheim business.

24:25.676 --> 24:27.428
You were there at the
drop-off with the Spaniard.

24:27.429 --> 24:28.612
You were good.

24:31.108 --> 24:32.821
So who are you working for now?

24:38.382 --> 24:39.691
Who's the girl?

24:40.081 --> 24:41.258
Who's the linchpin?

24:41.973 --> 24:43.549
Who put me in the cold?

24:44.355 --> 24:45.967
Who set me up?

24:46.290 --> 24:48.647
So you think there's
someone inside the CIA--

24:49.153 --> 24:50.212
a mole, a traitor?

24:50.213 --> 24:51.348
Is that what you think?

24:53.243 --> 24:54.872
You know, I think
you could be right.

24:55.732 --> 24:57.258
And I think it's you.

24:57.433 --> 24:58.675
You're making a mistake.

24:58.676 --> 25:00.952
No, you and your partner
are making a mistake.

25:00.953 --> 25:02.785
I don't have a partner.

25:03.283 --> 25:05.751
The guy out there, the one that
killed McGrath and Blakely

25:05.752 --> 25:07.683
and drove your friends
into the water,

25:07.722 --> 25:09.570
the one carrying out
operation Pandora,

25:09.571 --> 25:11.003
he's not with me.

25:12.697 --> 25:14.954
I saw him at the docks,
the way he moved.

25:14.955 --> 25:15.977
He's with you.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.011
He's CIA.

25:35.764 --> 25:37.274
Are you sure he's lying?

25:37.275 --> 25:39.332
He's not expressing any of
the physiological traits.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.191
He's trained to lie without
betraying himself.

25:41.192 --> 25:43.881
He wants to divide us, make
us suspicious of each other.

25:43.882 --> 25:46.021
Trust me.
There's no mole but him.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.279
What if you're wrong?
What if he's telling the truth?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.093
That is immaterial.

25:49.094 --> 25:50.502
Right now, there is
someone else out there,

25:50.503 --> 25:52.273
who is preparing to go
through with Pandora,

25:52.274 --> 25:54.069
and that girl is the key.

25:54.243 --> 25:55.587
We need to find her.

26:01.118 --> 26:03.007
Still negative on all databases.

26:03.008 --> 26:05.205
She's a foreign national.
She might not be in any of ours.

26:05.206 --> 26:06.138
What about her school uniform?

26:06.139 --> 26:07.360
Can you identify
her through that?

26:07.361 --> 26:10.475
We tried. There's not enough of
the crest visible to identify it.

26:10.476 --> 26:12.395
Do you really buy this,
that killing a little girl

26:12.396 --> 26:14.264
could lead to the collapse
of the United States?

26:14.265 --> 26:15.777
I mean, it just seems crazy.

26:15.778 --> 26:18.052
Yeah, well, so did
Blakely's first linchpin.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.914
They asked him to develop a
nonnuclear military strategy

26:20.915 --> 26:22.724
that would bring down
the Soviet Union.

26:22.725 --> 26:24.932
Turns out, all we had to
do was outspend them.

26:27.527 --> 26:28.885
Need to take another
run at Gage.

26:28.886 --> 26:30.428
Looks like he's all we've got.

26:43.990 --> 26:44.778
Put us on lockdown.

26:44.779 --> 26:46.765
No one leaves or
enters the facility.

26:50.925 --> 26:51.675
Contact Burns.

26:51.676 --> 26:53.336
He was shot point-blank.

26:53.337 --> 26:55.551
How is it that nobody
heard the shot?

26:55.552 --> 26:57.203
The room is soundproof.

26:57.233 --> 26:58.595
The real question is...

26:59.768 --> 27:01.245
how come nobody saw?

27:01.469 --> 27:03.031
Someone hacked the video steam.

27:03.197 --> 27:05.038
How is that possible?
You're the CIA.

27:05.039 --> 27:06.795
You have the most secure
computers in the world.

27:06.796 --> 27:08.188
It's possible because
Gage was right.

27:08.189 --> 27:09.611
There's a mole in the CIA,

27:09.612 --> 27:10.934
and he's in this unit.

27:10.935 --> 27:11.886
Facility's locked down.

27:11.887 --> 27:13.691
All personnel have
been accounted for.

27:13.692 --> 27:15.275
How many people had
access to that room?

27:15.276 --> 27:15.879
18.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.756
Ma'am, I've isolated the subroutine
used to doctor the video.

27:18.757 --> 27:21.380
It was embedded in a software
worm to escape detection.

27:21.381 --> 27:23.119
Then there's no way to
tell where it came from.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.960
I may be able to use a
reductive logarithm

27:24.961 --> 27:27.189
to isolate the pathway it
took through the system.

27:27.190 --> 27:28.517
It might tell us
where it was loaded.

27:28.518 --> 27:30.711
- You can do that?
- I can try.

27:30.792 --> 27:31.749
Do it.

27:33.533 --> 27:35.897
Wow. I got no idea what
they're talking about,

27:35.898 --> 27:37.440
but this is very exciting.

27:38.297 --> 27:39.031
There it is.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.270
Starting the trace.

27:45.982 --> 27:46.703
Got it.

27:46.704 --> 27:49.102
That's the terminal address
where the virus was uploaded.

27:49.103 --> 27:50.179
Whose is it?

27:53.643 --> 27:54.594
Agent Trahn's.

27:54.871 --> 27:56.018
What? No.

27:56.026 --> 27:57.610
- There's been a mistake.
- Get your hands where I can see them.

27:57.642 --> 27:58.907
Get down on the ground now!
Do it now!

27:58.931 --> 27:59.541
Down now!

27:59.564 --> 28:00.852
Wait! It's a decoy.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.295
The hacker piggybacked
the IP. It's not Trahn.

28:03.296 --> 28:04.138
Then who is it?

28:04.139 --> 28:06.142
Whoever uploaded it used
Trahn's terminal IP

28:06.143 --> 28:07.318
to hide their ID.

28:07.536 --> 28:09.657
They're good, but I'm better.

28:09.728 --> 28:11.100
I've isolated the
user's pass code.

28:11.101 --> 28:12.580
I'm de-encrypting now.

28:19.806 --> 28:21.175
Run a personnel match.

28:28.090 --> 28:29.375
Martin?

28:29.610 --> 28:30.631
No, Soph.

28:30.632 --> 28:31.972
I'm loyal. You know I'm loyal.

28:31.973 --> 28:33.262
Then put the gun down.

28:36.603 --> 28:37.561
Put it down!

28:37.562 --> 28:39.106
Okay.

28:39.269 --> 28:40.553
All right. Okay.

28:41.923 --> 28:42.556
Martin!

28:42.594 --> 28:44.373
You shoot, she dies.
Everyone, back up now.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.220
- Martin, don't. Don't do it.
- Back up now! Back--back up now!

28:46.221 --> 28:47.272
Hit it.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.773
Martin, don't.

28:49.604 --> 28:50.929
Martin, don't! Martin.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.625
Put the gun down, Martin.

28:52.626 --> 28:54.467
Thanks, but I'd rather live.

28:57.601 --> 28:59.145
Shut the elevator down.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.146
I'm in.

29:05.002 --> 29:06.715
Standby.
I'm bringing it back down.

29:31.778 --> 29:33.062
There's no way you
could've known.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.259
No? When we first got
wind of Pandora,

29:35.359 --> 29:37.654
Danberg was the one who
found all the connections.

29:37.655 --> 29:40.123
He was the one who
traced it to Gage,

29:40.124 --> 29:42.258
all so we wouldn't get
too close to him.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.945
He even tried to convince
me to get rid of you two.

29:45.824 --> 29:47.031
And worst of all,

29:47.908 --> 29:49.417
he may not be working alone.

29:52.002 --> 29:54.502
The implications of
Pandora are huge.

29:54.820 --> 29:57.504
I don't understand how one
of our own would actually

29:57.527 --> 29:59.971
want to plunge the country
or the world into war.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.580
Money, ideology-- none
of it makes any sense.

30:02.581 --> 30:03.728
Well, the motives don't matter.

30:03.729 --> 30:05.382
All that matters is
stopping Pandora.

30:05.383 --> 30:06.701
Gage said he picked up chatter.

30:06.702 --> 30:07.537
He said it's going
down tomorrow.

30:07.538 --> 30:08.404
We've heard the same thing,

30:08.405 --> 30:10.454
which means, we don't
have any time.

30:10.547 --> 30:12.041
We have to find her.

30:12.042 --> 30:13.577
Well, there's gotta be
something that we missed,

30:13.578 --> 30:16.099
some detail that'll help
us figure out who she is.

30:16.298 --> 30:17.973
We've run it through
every database we have.

30:17.974 --> 30:19.713
We have looked
through everything.

30:19.824 --> 30:20.992
Not everything.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.046
You guys maintain a
topographical survey

30:24.047 --> 30:24.960
of the earth, right?

30:24.961 --> 30:25.829
Yeah. Why?

30:25.830 --> 30:28.624
So don't search for the girl.

30:29.072 --> 30:30.192
Run the mountains.

30:30.193 --> 30:33.049
If we know where she's from,
we can narrow down our search.

30:33.849 --> 30:36.192
You are a genius.

30:44.872 --> 30:46.256
How long will this take?

30:47.495 --> 30:48.350
It's a big world.

30:48.351 --> 30:49.607
We've pulled anything arid

30:49.608 --> 30:51.745
and everything above and
below 60 degrees latitude,

30:51.746 --> 30:54.303
but they're estimating,
it could take 32 hours.

30:54.304 --> 30:55.416
Sounds like a long night.

30:55.417 --> 30:56.848
I'll get some coffees.

31:00.936 --> 31:02.473
He was always thoughtful.

31:04.785 --> 31:05.841
You like him.

31:07.224 --> 31:09.873
I did. Once.

31:13.959 --> 31:14.983
S-so what happened?

31:14.984 --> 31:16.519
If you don't mind my asking.

31:18.656 --> 31:20.130
Well, um,

31:20.769 --> 31:22.041
well, you ever...

31:22.696 --> 31:25.004
Meet someone and--and have that...

31:25.910 --> 31:28.851
intense attraction right away.

31:29.475 --> 31:30.884
You know, that tension?

31:31.123 --> 31:33.475
Well, we fought it for
months, and then...

31:36.491 --> 31:38.728
and then we just couldn't
stand it anymore.

31:42.323 --> 31:44.060
But afterward, it--it was like

31:44.100 --> 31:45.573
that tension was all we...

31:45.574 --> 31:47.074
had really,

31:47.075 --> 31:49.339
and without it, all we
were left with was that...

31:50.508 --> 31:53.276
well, those things that drove
us crazy about each other.

31:53.884 --> 31:55.491
I mean, you know how he can be.

31:56.060 --> 31:57.179
Yeah.

31:57.627 --> 31:58.764
Yeah, I do.

32:01.756 --> 32:04.211
Sometimes I wish we had
never slept together.

32:07.796 --> 32:09.188
Had kept that longing.

32:14.195 --> 32:17.676
Even your coffee mugs say "CIA."
That is so cool.

32:18.058 --> 32:19.042
Well, we save the world,

32:19.043 --> 32:20.565
maybe I'll let you keep one.

32:20.867 --> 32:21.972
Incentive.

32:55.255 --> 32:56.577
Uh, the topography
matches terrain

32:56.578 --> 32:58.431
in the Chinese
province of Zhejiang,

32:58.432 --> 33:00.088
just outside the
City of Hangzhou.

33:00.089 --> 33:01.055
That's near Shanghai.

33:01.056 --> 33:03.825
Pull up all school uniform
insignias from that region.

33:06.690 --> 33:08.288
Wait. Right there on
the top right corner.

33:08.289 --> 33:09.576
They're the same color.

33:09.577 --> 33:11.456
Shanghai #12 Girls' School.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.528
Do they have a web site?

33:12.529 --> 33:13.868
It's password protected.

33:13.869 --> 33:15.242
Picking the lock now.

33:15.578 --> 33:18.153
Hack into their photo
archives and run facial rec.

33:20.656 --> 33:22.554
Bring up the captions
and compare.

33:23.212 --> 33:24.851
Got her. Mia Ganghong.

33:24.852 --> 33:26.145
What do we know about her?

33:26.146 --> 33:27.255
Uh, not much.

33:27.256 --> 33:30.625
Just that she's the daughter
of Xiang and Biyu Ganghong.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.942
Xiang Ganghong?

33:31.943 --> 33:33.016
Who's Xiang Ganghong?

33:33.017 --> 33:34.224
He's a Chinese businessman

33:34.225 --> 33:36.726
with close ties to
the finance minister

33:36.727 --> 33:38.284
and members of the ruling party.

33:38.285 --> 33:40.478
Well, why is his
daughter targeted?

33:40.479 --> 33:41.846
Xiang is a kingmaker.

33:41.847 --> 33:43.369
He's extremely influential

33:43.370 --> 33:45.490
in shaping his government's
economic policy.

33:45.491 --> 33:48.553
He made his fortune selling
Chinese military hardware,

33:48.554 --> 33:49.643
sometimes to our enemies,

33:49.644 --> 33:52.136
but we left him alone
because he was supportive

33:52.137 --> 33:54.368
of China's purchase
of US debt.

33:54.369 --> 33:56.449
Now if someone were
to take out Xiang,

33:57.002 --> 33:58.330
not that much would change.

33:58.331 --> 34:00.974
But if his daughter were killed

34:00.979 --> 34:02.682
in a botched
assassination attempt,

34:02.683 --> 34:03.892
and the Chinese were
able to trace it

34:03.893 --> 34:05.539
back to the US government?

34:05.540 --> 34:06.587
The trail that led to Gage.

34:06.588 --> 34:08.031
It's conceivable
that Xiang could use

34:08.032 --> 34:09.304
his considerable influence

34:09.304 --> 34:12.781
to single handedly end China's
purchase of the US debt.

34:12.782 --> 34:14.402
This country runs on
deficit spending.

34:14.402 --> 34:16.024
If--if we can't borrow money--

34:16.025 --> 34:17.440
We couldn't meet
our obligations,

34:17.440 --> 34:18.545
the government would shut down.

34:18.545 --> 34:19.992
Austerity measures
would be imposed.

34:19.993 --> 34:22.871
We'd lose our ability to deploy
our military around the world.

34:22.871 --> 34:24.375
And then with the
US neutralized,

34:24.376 --> 34:25.551
our enemies would be able

34:25.552 --> 34:27.639
to explore their
interests unchecked.

34:27.641 --> 34:28.330
That's right.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.184
And there would be an explosion
of regional conflicts,

34:30.185 --> 34:32.623
any one of which could
send us toward global war.

34:32.625 --> 34:34.228
A war that we might not
even be able to win.

34:34.230 --> 34:36.687
One domino knocked down,
the entire world changes.

34:36.688 --> 34:38.991
We've located Xiang.
He and a Chinese delegation

34:38.992 --> 34:40.855
just landed at JFK
an hour ago.

34:40.856 --> 34:41.686
He's here?

34:41.687 --> 34:43.696
For a UN Trade Conference
at the McKinley building.

34:43.697 --> 34:44.664
They're on their way there now.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.054
And, ma'am, his
daughter's with him.

34:57.177 --> 34:57.848
If we call it in,

34:57.849 --> 34:59.825
I can get a protective
detail waiting.

34:59.826 --> 35:01.584
You think your cops are
gonna be able to stop

35:01.585 --> 35:03.152
CIA-trained operatives?

35:03.153 --> 35:04.345
They'd just end up dead.

35:04.346 --> 35:05.515
Besides, if word
of this gets out,

35:05.516 --> 35:07.055
it could spark an
international incident

35:07.056 --> 35:08.608
of epic proportions.

35:08.609 --> 35:10.598
We need to clean up the
mess, not make one.

35:10.599 --> 35:11.815
We and what army?

35:11.816 --> 35:13.102
You said we couldn't
trust the others

35:13.103 --> 35:14.630
because they could be
working with Danberg.

35:14.631 --> 35:16.534
This is not the only CIA
station in New York.

35:16.535 --> 35:17.814
I've got another field
team on its way.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.461
You seal it up until
you hear from me.

35:19.462 --> 35:21.014
No calls going in or out.

35:21.015 --> 35:22.025
I'm not taking any chances.

35:22.026 --> 35:23.016
Yes, ma'am.

35:33.194 --> 35:35.697
Agent Corrigan, detective
Beckett and Mr. Castle.

35:35.905 --> 35:36.608
Where's the delegation?

35:36.609 --> 35:37.709
Five minutes away.

35:37.710 --> 35:38.614
We in position?

35:38.615 --> 35:41.078
We have teams in the lobby and
spotters across the street.

35:41.079 --> 35:42.247
What about Danberg?

35:42.248 --> 35:43.911
A guard IDed him
as having entered the building

35:43.912 --> 35:45.096
45 minutes ago.

35:45.097 --> 35:47.119
We have crews in place
authorized to take him out,

35:47.120 --> 35:48.890
but we still haven't
identified his partner.

35:48.891 --> 35:50.918
Whatever happens,
keep the girl alive.

35:50.919 --> 35:51.862
Do you understand me?

35:51.863 --> 35:52.912
Yes, ma'am.

35:55.667 --> 35:56.576
Where are we going?

35:56.577 --> 35:57.410
This way.

36:09.437 --> 36:10.539
What are we doing down here?

36:10.540 --> 36:12.278
Shouldn't we be
headed for the lobby?

36:13.262 --> 36:14.453
Castle.

36:16.213 --> 36:17.212
Sorry.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.412
What are you doing?

36:25.549 --> 36:27.562
Danberg wasn't the mole, was he?

36:28.060 --> 36:29.075
You are.

36:30.317 --> 36:32.397
Go kill the girl.
I'll take care of these two.

36:38.398 --> 36:39.992
It was you this whole time?

36:40.135 --> 36:41.381
I'm afraid so.

36:52.887 --> 36:53.686
Then why bring us here?

36:53.687 --> 36:55.712
Why not just leave
us at the facility?

36:55.911 --> 36:59.983
Because you just don't stop.

37:00.431 --> 37:02.663
You need to know the
story, the whole story.

37:02.664 --> 37:05.384
And if something doesn't add
up, you just don't let go.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.328
Why do you think I
brought you inside?

37:07.464 --> 37:08.702
I was protecting the op.

37:08.703 --> 37:10.478
Like you were trying to
protect the operation

37:10.479 --> 37:12.575
when you killed
Blakely and McGrath?

37:12.703 --> 37:14.136
You set up Gage.

37:14.207 --> 37:15.335
Well, for the linchpin to work,

37:15.336 --> 37:17.503
the Chinese have to blame
the US government.

37:17.504 --> 37:20.352
The operation has to
trace back to the CIA.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.263
And when you needed to cover
your tracks, you killed him.

37:22.264 --> 37:23.687
So then you needed someone else.

37:23.688 --> 37:25.055
You needed Danberg.

37:26.184 --> 37:27.504
Sophia...

37:28.143 --> 37:30.280
World War III, why?

37:30.631 --> 37:32.438
Let's just say, there
are certain parties

37:32.439 --> 37:35.331
who will pay anything
to reshape the world.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.325
I don't buy it.

37:47.252 --> 37:48.893
The Sophia I know wouldn't
sell out her country,

37:48.894 --> 37:50.556
not for money, not for anything.

37:52.718 --> 37:54.909
Well, that's one thing
you got wrong, Rick.

37:58.647 --> 38:00.688
On your knees right now.

38:00.823 --> 38:01.912
Both of you.

38:10.043 --> 38:11.290
You're never gonna
get away with this.

38:11.291 --> 38:12.753
Of course I will.

38:13.035 --> 38:15.800
I'll just tell them how we all
tried to stop it and couldn't,

38:15.978 --> 38:17.568
and the two of you were
killed in the process,

38:17.569 --> 38:19.184
by Danberg, of course.

38:20.296 --> 38:22.161
Don't worry.
I'll make it sound heroic.

38:23.137 --> 38:24.880
Your father will be very proud.

38:27.274 --> 38:28.416
My father?

38:28.690 --> 38:30.313
Well, you don't think you
gained special access

38:30.314 --> 38:32.737
to the CIA back then
because of your charm.

38:39.754 --> 38:41.424
You really don't know, do you?

38:43.364 --> 38:44.733
I guess you never will.

38:44.773 --> 38:45.909
No!

38:51.948 --> 38:52.958
Come on.

38:53.324 --> 38:54.962
It's just us, and
we're out of time.

39:50.584 --> 39:51.733
Whoa!

39:52.472 --> 39:53.520
Are you okay?

39:53.785 --> 39:54.832
He's fine.

39:54.897 --> 39:56.072
He's good. He's okay.

39:56.073 --> 39:57.383
- Sir, are you all right?
- You all right?

39:57.384 --> 39:59.103
- This way.
- Yeah, maybe we should go outside.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.234
So what do you think
this was all about?

40:16.643 --> 40:17.794
They didn't tell you?

40:18.213 --> 40:19.324
What? Th--

40:19.325 --> 40:20.301
Huh.

40:21.317 --> 40:22.660
They--they told you?

40:22.909 --> 40:23.822
Once she turned me out,

40:23.823 --> 40:25.434
it didn't take long to
put the pieces together.

40:25.435 --> 40:28.146
But all I could do was watch

40:28.147 --> 40:29.946
and wait for her
to make her move.

40:30.066 --> 40:31.643
Hard to believe she
was a traitor.

40:31.644 --> 40:32.899
It was all an act.

40:32.900 --> 40:36.163
Langley thinks she may have
been a former KGB sleeper

40:36.164 --> 40:38.467
set adrift when the
Soviet Union broke up.

40:38.475 --> 40:41.275
Stayed with the company because
she had nowhere else to go.

40:41.299 --> 40:42.803
Till a better offer came along.

40:42.804 --> 40:44.882
Did you ever find out who
she was working for,

40:44.883 --> 40:46.114
who was behind Pandora?

40:46.115 --> 40:49.428
No, and even if I did,
I couldn't tell you.

40:49.429 --> 40:50.852
Agent Danberg...

40:53.660 --> 40:54.818
Sophia said something,

40:54.819 --> 40:58.972
something about my
father being in the CIA.

40:58.973 --> 41:01.147
Would you know
anything about that?

41:01.668 --> 41:02.939
I'm afraid I don't.

41:03.155 --> 41:04.172
Sorry.

41:04.956 --> 41:06.579
Oh, uh, detective Beckett.

41:06.708 --> 41:07.787
Here.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.595
I had our guys, uh,
take care of your car.

41:10.596 --> 41:12.174
You pulled my car
out of the river?

41:12.175 --> 41:15.436
Yep. I think you will
find it better than new.

41:15.668 --> 41:16.708
Thank you.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.798
It's the least that we could do.

41:19.567 --> 41:20.654
Take care.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.775
You think she was
telling the truth

41:34.870 --> 41:35.718
about my father?

41:35.719 --> 41:37.941
I mean, that would explain

41:37.942 --> 41:39.662
why he completely disappeared.

41:40.103 --> 41:41.309
I...

41:42.839 --> 41:45.140
I think that Sophia
told a lot of lies.

41:49.158 --> 41:50.326
Must be tough,

41:51.447 --> 41:52.645
finding out that
she's a traitor,

41:52.646 --> 41:55.222
especially after you based
Clara Strike on her and all.

41:57.859 --> 41:59.267
Hmm. Well...

42:00.214 --> 42:02.780
Clara started off
as Sophia, but...

42:03.653 --> 42:05.789
she ended up being more
like you, you know--

42:05.790 --> 42:07.942
smart, fierce, kind.

42:09.566 --> 42:11.645
I think that's one of the
reasons I was drawn to you

42:12.102 --> 42:13.278
as a muse.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.118
You think Dr. Blakely
was right...

42:16.735 --> 42:18.011
about the linchpin?

42:18.012 --> 42:20.946
Do you think we actually
saved the world?

42:21.282 --> 42:24.195
I think that we saved
a little girl's life,

42:24.291 --> 42:25.627
and that's enough for me.
