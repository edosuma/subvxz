WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:02.160
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.240 --> 00:03.765
I need you to answer
a few questions for me.

00:03.840 --> 00:05.524
I'm seeing things
that I can't explain.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.320
Wu, this is not the time...
No, it never is!

00:13.480 --> 00:14.766
Shaw is bad news.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.490
He's got some kind
of beef with Nick.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.285
A wolfsangel.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.731
Go to hell.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.810
At your back
door, it'll be your blood next.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.689
Officer Acker's gonna
be out there all night.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.000
I feel like we
should do something.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.451
Excuse me.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.401
Ah!

00:49.200 --> 00:50.690
"He had them brought before the court,
and a judgment was handed down."

01:31.400 --> 01:32.686
No excuse for what I did.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.000
You're coming with us.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.210
I can't handle it anymore.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.044
You want answers,
here's your chance.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.210
Uh...
What are we doing?

02:10.280 --> 02:11.486
You'll see.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.406
I'll see what?

02:14.600 --> 02:17.126
It'll be a lot easier to
show you than tell you, Wu.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.800
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.000
I don't care if it's easier. Why don't
you just tell me a little first?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.165
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.366
I heard that, Hank.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.251
Why isn't it such a good idea?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.802
You take me out of jail.
You bring me to the woods.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.921
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.281
Listen, man. You've been asking
a lot of questions lately.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.851
You want answers or not?

02:36.840 --> 02:39.081
Yeah.
Yeah, I want answers.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.890
You know the book
you found at my house?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.240
Well, I've got more of them.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.763
If that's not something
you're interested in,

02:54.360 --> 02:57.045
we can turn back around,
never talk about this again.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.447
No.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.561
Let's see what you got.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.481
This is where we come to figure
out what we're dealing with.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.648
This is what you saw, isn't it?

04:10.320 --> 04:12.049
I don't know.
You saw it.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.685
So did I.
Me, too.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.325
And I've seen Skalengecks,

04:24.680 --> 04:26.205
and Blutbaden,

04:28.320 --> 04:30.846
and Daemonfeuers,

04:36.320 --> 04:37.526
and Aswang.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.604
And they're real, all of them.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.291
Sometimes we see them.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.644
Nick sees them a lot more.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.891
I didn't imagine it.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.366
No.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.770
They're called Wesen.

04:59.880 --> 05:00.961
And I'm a Grimm.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.081
Just like my mom.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.165
It's kind of like having an
ability to see the truth.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.564
Grimm's are what? You mean
like those German brothers?

05:11.640 --> 05:15.167
Yeah, kind of related to them.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.771
Theresa is a Grimm, too. That's
why she was staying with me.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.926
That's how she was able
to kill Weston Steward.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.286
She knew what he was.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.525
But he didn't know what she was,

05:34.440 --> 05:35.805
until it was too late.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.250
Steward was a Hundjager.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.926
All of these books, the weapons,
everything in this trailer

05:42.000 --> 05:43.764
has been in my
family for generations.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.243
So then I'm a Grimm,
too, and Hank?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.323
No, no, no, we are not like him.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.361
I was having the same problem.
Nick had to bring me in

05:51.440 --> 05:54.444
because I was going down
a bad road real fast,

05:54.520 --> 05:55.567
just like you were.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.482
So, you think you
can handle this?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.925
Or do you just
want to walk away?

06:10.680 --> 06:12.170
I'm not going anywhere.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.606
Hi, Mom.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.883
No, we're not in bed yet.
It's fine.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.248
Yeah, all packed up.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.320
Car's picking us up at 8:00.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.928
Mom, it's my honeymoon.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.442
I'll call you when I call you, and
I'll text you when I text you.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.083
Okay. Love you, too. Bye.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.010
Monroe?

06:55.120 --> 06:56.246
You up there?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.321
Hmm.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.767
Monroe?

07:16.880 --> 07:17.927
Monroe!

07:30.400 --> 07:31.401
Monroe!

07:33.040 --> 07:34.087
Monroe!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.081
Monroe!

07:40.880 --> 07:42.086
Officer Acker.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.247
Officer Acker!

07:46.400 --> 07:48.971
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.771
I'm gonna love watching you die.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.885
The Aswang is real, too?

09:00.640 --> 09:01.721
Why did you lie to me?

09:01.800 --> 09:02.801
We were trying to protect you.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.530
How do I know you're
not lying to me now?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.011
You don't.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.968
You just have to believe us
or think that we're crazy.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.805
If these monsters, or Wesen, or
whatever the hell you call them,

09:11.880 --> 09:13.325
are real, then where are they?

09:13.800 --> 09:14.881
How many are there?

09:14.960 --> 09:16.485
Shouldn't we be
out killing them?

09:16.560 --> 09:17.971
Not all Wesen are bad.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.768
Some of my closest
friends are Wesen.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.650
Oh, so there are friendly ones, too.
Good to know.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.121
Hey, Rosalee.
Nick.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.328
Nick, they took him!
They took Monroe!

09:33.840 --> 09:34.841
What?

09:35.320 --> 09:37.482
He went outside
and they grabbed him!

09:37.600 --> 09:39.125
Officer Acker is
lying on the ground.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.929
Where are you now?
Back in the house.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.001
Did you call 9-1-1?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.929
Yes. Oh, my God.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.970
Listen to me.
Stay inside. Lock the doors.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.883
Do not leave until
the police get there.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.961
We're on our way.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.001
They took Monroe.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.565
What?
Who?

09:56.680 --> 09:59.120
Right now, we have to go. We'll
explain everything on the way.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.847
Stop! Stop!

10:38.720 --> 10:39.767
What happened?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.444
Officer Acker saw
someone on the street.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.403
He got out of his
car to investigate.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.482
He got cracked on the head and
dragged somewhere up there.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.562
Anyone see it?
No. We're working on it.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.120
Hey, you okay?
I heard what happened.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.560
It's all good, just a misunderstanding.
Let's get an update.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.006
How you doin'?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.366
I feel terrible, man.
This is all my fault.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.130
Well, can you tell us what you saw?
Not much.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.009
I, um, thought I saw something,

10:59.080 --> 11:01.082
got out to have a look,
was hit from behind.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.491
You see any vehicles?

11:02.560 --> 11:05.040
No. it happened so fast.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.406
All right, take it easy.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.685
Did you find out anything?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.040
Officer Acker was
hit from behind.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.326
He didn't see anything.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.680
We've got somebody
talking to neighbors

11:16.760 --> 11:17.960
to see if anybody saw anything.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.809
We need to find them
before they hurt him.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.207
But right now I
need you to calm down

11:22.280 --> 11:23.884
and answer a few questions,
okay?

11:24.960 --> 11:27.361
Okay. Okay.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.766
You said you went outside.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.126
To look for Monroe.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.210
He brought Officer Acker something
to eat, and he didn't come back.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.520
Did you hear anything?
No.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.931
I was on the phone with my mom.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.240
Any other calls? Threats?

11:37.320 --> 11:39.800
Not since the Spice Shop. If they
hurt Monroe, I'm gonna kill them!

11:39.880 --> 11:42.281
I will hunt them down and I
will kill every one of them.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.125
Right now, what I want you
to do is grab what you need,

11:45.520 --> 11:47.204
and I'm going to have someone
take you to our house.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.441
No! What if they call?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.767
We'll forward any
calls to you on your cell.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.046
We don't want you here.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.171
I will call you as soon as
we find out anything.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.480
Rosalee.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.090
We will find him. Okay?
Now, grab your stuff.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.325
I'll call Juliette.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.130
Nick, hey, when are
you going to be home?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.328
I really,
really need to talk to you.

12:16.440 --> 12:17.646
They grabbed Monroe.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.001
The Wesenrein have him.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.281
What... No!

12:21.360 --> 12:23.240
I'm gonna have Rosalee
dropped off at our house.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.681
Right now?

12:25.840 --> 12:27.560
Yeah, it's too dangerous
for her to be here.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.242
Juliette?
Uh, yeah, yeah.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.891
Yeah. Yeah, bring her over.
I just...

12:36.840 --> 12:38.842
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe it.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.365
She's going to need you.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.000
I might not be home
for a little while.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.166
Okay, be careful.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.800
Impuro.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.041
Impuro.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.080
Impuro. Impuro.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.484
Impuro!

13:47.320 --> 13:48.924
Impuro!

13:49.400 --> 13:52.449
Impuro!

13:54.120 --> 13:55.600
Why did you get
out of your car?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.324
Kid walked by
the house wearing a hoodie.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.522
I didn't think anything about
it, except a few minutes later,

13:59.600 --> 14:00.840
I thought I saw
the same guy across

14:00.920 --> 14:02.206
the street so I went
to go check it out.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.129
Was it the same guy?
Couldn't tell.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.645
It was dark.
He was near the trees.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.688
I was about to call it in.
That's when I got hit.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.683
Went for my weapon,
got hit again.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.445
Don't remember
anything after that.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.443
Just waking up in the woods and
hearing the wife screaming.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.488
I know I screwed this up, you guys.
I'm sorry.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.521
It happens.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.721
Go home and get some rest.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.961
All right.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.881
Why did he wait to call it in?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.803
Maybe he was
trying to be a hero.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.885
Thanks for bringing her over.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.807
I'm so scared.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.649
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.249
"Secundum
Naturae Ordinem Wesen."

15:00.320 --> 15:01.401
Also known as Wesenrein.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.520
Yeah, I know what they are.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.240
This is a list of the people we think
are involved in taking Monroe.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.602
Trubel did some work
on this before she left.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.409
She found a Wesenrein
mask on one of them.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.050
Being part of a hate
group is not a crime.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.724
Do you have any evidence
tying them to the kidnapping?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.484
Yeah, we have a brick through
the window of the Spice Shop

15:14.600 --> 15:16.011
that had a symbol of
the wolfsangel on it.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.360
And then they
burned a wolfsangel

15:17.400 --> 15:18.640
in Monroe and
Rosalee's front yard.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.848
And they gutted a fox and
hung it on their back door.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.604
So we know this
group is involved.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.560
And the longer this goes on, the less
likely we are to find Monroe alive.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.405
We need to go now. Starting with
the first name on that list,

15:28.480 --> 15:29.606
Shaw Steinkellner.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.041
Bring him in.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.120
By the way, how are you
going to handle Wu?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.201
We already did.

15:38.760 --> 15:39.761
How'd he take it?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.001
He didn't quit.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.041
Does he know about me?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.051
We'll leave that up to you.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.927
I already told your Grimm
friend I got no beef with you.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.241
Monroe. Where is he? We know
the Wesenrein have him.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.481
Don't know what
you're talkin' about.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.891
Well, we think you do.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.401
Well, what do you know.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.126
Water.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.561
Hey.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.765
I need water!

16:45.240 --> 16:48.608
Damn, they really messed you up.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.286
Can you sit?

16:54.440 --> 16:55.487
My head!

17:00.840 --> 17:02.046
Where am I?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.808
I tell you that,
and I'm in big trouble.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.006
Let me get you some water.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.448
Don't tell anyone
I'm doin' this for you.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.040
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

17:16.839 --> 17:17.965
Thank you.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.282
What's the matter, Impuro?

17:27.440 --> 17:28.965
You don't like vodka?

17:29.480 --> 17:30.527
Dumbass.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.400
You should know that Blutbaden
don't lie with the Fuchsbau!

17:54.600 --> 17:55.601
Hey.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.161
Hey.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.171
No, no. It's okay.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.327
It's okay.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.441
Oh, my God!

18:14.280 --> 18:15.850
How long have you been here?

18:17.600 --> 18:18.726
I don't know.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.204
Do you know where we are?

18:27.080 --> 18:28.081
No.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.801
What's your name?

18:33.400 --> 18:34.526
Terry.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.043
Is my wife okay?

18:40.760 --> 18:41.966
Your wife?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.724
They take her, too?

18:46.880 --> 18:47.961
I don't know.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.049
I hope not.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.007
You don't know
what they do to you.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.567
Yo!

18:59.240 --> 19:00.480
Don't be talkin' to him!

19:13.520 --> 19:15.409
I want anyone tied
to the Wesenrein.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.928
How much time do I have? None.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.408
How persuasive
you want me to be?

19:21.400 --> 19:22.401
Extremely.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.131
I'll see what I can do.

19:37.880 --> 19:38.927
You wanted to see me?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.411
Yeah. Come in.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.131
I understand you had a talk
with Burkhardt and Griffin.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.724
Yeah. Yeah, we talked.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.280
They explain everything?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.211
You mean about Theresa?

19:57.240 --> 19:58.890
Yeah, that, too.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.524
Nick told you that
he sees things, right?

20:08.120 --> 20:09.121
Uh-huh.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.443
And you do understand that everything
Nick told you is all real?

20:17.120 --> 20:18.406
Yeah, I... Uh...

20:20.200 --> 20:21.850
So you know all about...

20:21.920 --> 20:22.967
I do.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.210
Didn't see that one coming.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.688
It's better than being
crazy, isn't it?

20:27.840 --> 20:30.684
Well, I'm still
a little, you know...

20:30.760 --> 20:32.171
Yeah. Well,
take your time.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.045
Now, you didn't tell anyone?

20:34.120 --> 20:35.485
No. No, of course not.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.601
Well, don't.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.801
Anything else?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.241
Are you...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.764
You don't want to go there.
No. I don't.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.320
Thank you, sir.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.089
Where's your Gleichheit?

21:16.800 --> 21:20.930
I see you without it again
and you won't need a mask.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.521
It's time.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.924
Here! Here!

21:32.720 --> 21:34.131
Give this to my wife.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.565
No!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.687
Where are you taking him?

21:38.760 --> 21:39.807
No!

21:41.400 --> 21:42.401
No!

21:43.960 --> 21:45.166
No.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.486
No, no, please.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.846
No!

21:52.520 --> 21:53.601
No!

21:54.360 --> 21:55.407
No!

21:55.800 --> 21:57.643
Heartbreaking, isn't it?

22:26.280 --> 22:27.770
Good morning, sunshine.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.446
You should have knocked.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.726
Time to go.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.527
Go where?

22:33.600 --> 22:34.601
Portland.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.649
I'm never going back there.
They'll kill me.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.847
You're not going alone.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.523
Who's going with me this time?

22:43.960 --> 22:46.611
The only people who have any
connection to your child are there,

22:46.680 --> 22:48.125
so we will be, too.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.240
You wanna tell us
about that?

22:52.760 --> 22:54.444
Hmm. Cool, huh?

22:55.200 --> 22:56.440
Gonna wear it for Halloween.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.165
So, why is it
in your pocket?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.123
Halloween's a long way away.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.244
Maybe you were gonna scare
some people tonight?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.811
Yeah. Cops.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.201
You know, you can spend a lot of
time in prison for kidnapping.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.800
Kidnapping? What kidnapping?
You got nothin' on me.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.530
Tell us about the Wesenrein.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.170
What's that, some kind of beer?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.280
Give us a minute, will you?

23:15.320 --> 23:16.321
Sure.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.883
Now you're gonna
get tough with me.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.610
What, are you
gonna throw me around?

23:30.520 --> 23:31.851
Well, this should be
interesting.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.080
You know where Monroe is,

23:35.480 --> 23:36.686
and you know who has him.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.850
Monroe. Is that his
first name or last?

23:39.920 --> 23:40.921
I'm not gonna ask again.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.525
Good, cause I'm
gettin' kind of bored.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.766
Well, so am l.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.411
You're dead!

23:53.840 --> 23:55.365
I thought you
weren't a Grimm no more.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.361
Well, you thought wrong.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.441
Where did they take him? Where
did the Wesenrein take him?

24:03.520 --> 24:07.570
I would rather be killed by a Grimm
than cross the Grand Master.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.529
Let's see if that's true.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.729
He's going to kill him.
Get him out.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.520
You don't know
what they'll do to me.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.050
Where is he?

24:17.440 --> 24:19.568
Nick! Nick, you need
to get out of here.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.407
You all right?

24:30.480 --> 24:31.481
No!

24:31.560 --> 24:32.800
He tried to kill me!

24:33.960 --> 24:36.042
I'm gonna sue him,
sue all of you!

24:36.280 --> 24:37.560
Well, I understand you're upset.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.806
I want a lawyer!

24:39.880 --> 24:44.442
See, here's the thing. There's a
more primal law at work here.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.403
Now, you're a Klaustreich.
Nick's a Grimm.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.971
I wouldn't push it.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.087
He knows.
This son of a bitch knows.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.161
I'm trying one more time.
No, no, no.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.651
Our best chance
right now is to put

25:06.720 --> 25:08.006
Shaw back out there
and see what he does.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.161
We can't let him go!

25:09.240 --> 25:11.720
Right now we've got nothing on
Shaw or any of the other guys.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.610
Let's put someone
on Shaw's house.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.725
No, not you. You stay.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.730
Now listen, we can't
just put anyone on Shaw.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.847
Have you told Wu
this case is Wesen?

25:20.920 --> 25:21.921
No.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.641
Well then we tell him.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.406
I made up the guest bedroom.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.767
You should try
to get some sleep.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.444
I can't sleep.
I don't want to sleep.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.966
Okay, well, as long as we're gonna
stay up, I'll make some coffee.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.649
We don't even know
if he's still alive.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.406
Don't go there.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.210
I feel like I can't breathe.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.442
Nick is doing everything he can.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.007
I know.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.924
I know but I can't just

26:03.400 --> 26:04.890
sit here and do nothing.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.521
He will find him.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.320
He will.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.361
Oh...

26:11.680 --> 26:14.286
The night before we got
married we were lying in bed,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.891
and Monroe told me that
for the rest of our lives

26:19.000 --> 26:21.082
we'll be known as
Monroe and Rosalee.

26:22.280 --> 26:26.365
Not just Monroe, not just
Rosalee, but Monroe and Rosalee.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.005
I can't lose him now.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.929
I can't lose him now.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.842
Uh, something you
wanted me to do, sir?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.246
Let's have a talk first.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.445
So, all of you here.
Well...

26:56.040 --> 26:57.644
So, this must be important.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.810
It is. You know what
happened to Monroe?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.245
- Yeah.
- Monroe was taken

27:01.400 --> 27:03.129
by a Wesen hate
group called Wesenrein.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.361
Monroe's Wesen?

27:04.440 --> 27:05.441
One of the good ones.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.925
But since the only cops who
know what we're up against

27:07.000 --> 27:08.570
are in this room,

27:08.680 --> 27:10.091
we're gonna need your help.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.326
Okay.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.610
Now, this may push a little
outside normal police procedure.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.250
We need to know
you're okay with that.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.447
Because we are.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.681
I will do whatever I
can to help find Monroe,

27:26.760 --> 27:29.411
but when this is over,
I'm gonna need to have

27:29.480 --> 27:32.051
a more, you know,
in-depth talk about...

27:32.120 --> 27:33.565
There'll be plenty
of time for that.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.727
Release Shaw.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.640
Hey, Sarge?

27:44.040 --> 27:45.246
Sarge, listen,
I just want to say,

27:45.320 --> 27:46.651
I know I messed
this thing up badly...

27:46.720 --> 27:48.688
What are you doing here? You
should be home getting some sleep.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.728
No, I feel like I should be doing
something to make up for this.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.087
Listen, you're a good cop. But
sometimes it doesn't go your way.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.161
How can I help?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.924
Go home and get some sleep.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.566
I can't do that, Sergeant.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.165
You can if I order you to.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.966
Go home.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.441
Yeah?

28:29.560 --> 28:31.520
Shaw, the cops put
someone on your house.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.120
Oh, crap.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.562
Leave the lights on.
Walk out the back door.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.720
Get in.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.965
What the hell's going on?

29:01.960 --> 29:03.724
I didn't tell the cops nothin'.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.444
I know you didn't,
Shaw.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.044
The only problem is, you will.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.890
No! I swear,
Grand Master!

29:12.240 --> 29:14.242
I would never say anything.
No, I swear!

29:34.680 --> 29:36.125
Juliette, sorry to wake you,

29:36.200 --> 29:38.240
but I'm worried Nick might
have been trying to call.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.490
Rosalee.
Could you check your phone,

29:40.560 --> 29:41.800
just make sure it's on, please?

29:41.880 --> 29:42.961
Yeah, of course.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.170
I didn't realize
how tired I was.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.210
It's on. Nothing.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.241
It's been hours.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.286
Nick is doing
everything he can...

29:53.360 --> 29:54.521
Then where's Monroe?

29:54.600 --> 29:55.931
Why haven't they found him yet?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.286
Listen, I know this
is difficult for you...

29:57.480 --> 29:59.448
No, you don't.
Don't say that.

29:59.560 --> 30:02.245
Monroe is missing, and Nick
is out there playing cop,

30:02.400 --> 30:03.640
when he needs to be a Grimm.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.609
He needs to hunt
these animals down

30:05.680 --> 30:07.569
and kill them
before they kill Monroe.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.801
Is that too much to ask?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.000
Okay, you need to calm down.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.326
Don't tell me to calm down.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.731
Rosalie, I know you're upset...

30:12.800 --> 30:14.404
I have a right to be upset!

30:14.480 --> 30:16.528
I need you to pick up
your phone and call Nick,

30:16.680 --> 30:18.045
and tell him to do
whatever he has to do

30:18.120 --> 30:19.520
to find Monroe,
he'll listen to you.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.843
Don't turn your back on me
when I'm talking to you.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.251
Please, stop.
My head. I have a...

30:23.320 --> 30:25.084
I'm so sick of
hearing about your headache!

30:25.200 --> 30:26.531
Please, Rosalee,
just give me a minute.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.682
Call Nick, right now!
Rosalee.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.841
Please!
Call him!

30:29.920 --> 30:30.921
Walk away!

30:31.000 --> 30:32.161
What?

30:35.600 --> 30:36.761
Oh!

30:36.840 --> 30:37.841
I warned you!

30:55.160 --> 30:56.161
Oh, my God!

31:02.280 --> 31:03.566
What have I done?

31:06.600 --> 31:07.965
Juliette?

31:08.960 --> 31:10.371
You were having a nightmare.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.402
It must have been pretty awful.
You were screaming.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.446
Nick didn't come home?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.570
No. No.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.969
He must be working
around the clock.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.211
Did you get any sleep?

31:28.640 --> 31:29.641
No.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.284
I'm gonna go make
us something to eat.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.761
Okay.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.160
Somebody, help!

31:53.280 --> 31:55.328
Please! Help, somebody!

31:55.840 --> 31:57.046
Please, help!

31:57.480 --> 31:59.448
Help! Please!

31:59.560 --> 32:03.326
Shaw works at T&M's Auto Shop
on southeast Carlson Street.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.209
So does Dempsey.
Ah...

32:05.280 --> 32:08.807
Briggs collects unemployment, lives
with his mother at Canter and Third.

32:08.880 --> 32:12.282
Howard is a short-order cook at
Southside Diner, open 24 hours.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.169
Probably not the best place
to stash someone.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.329
Harold Johnson currently
works at Donavon Tools,

32:17.520 --> 32:19.363
at 14th and northeast Westler.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.521
Monroe could be anywhere.

32:24.960 --> 32:25.961
Wu.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.040
We're on our way.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.360
Somebody got to Shaw.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.121
Shaw got here before I did.
I was out front all night.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.009
Nobody came in or
out of the front,

32:38.080 --> 32:40.082
so whoever got to him
got to him back here.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.088
Somebody didn't like
that he talked to us.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.366
Why would you go
out the back unless

32:48.440 --> 32:49.601
you thought you
were being watched?

32:49.680 --> 32:51.364
Somebody tipped him off.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.044
This is a Wesen killing, right?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.963
Yeah, it is.
Good to know.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.849
Can you tell by the way he
died what kind of Wesen...

32:57.920 --> 32:59.081
No.
No.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.286
Let's check inside.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.361
This way.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.041
Found something!

33:18.400 --> 33:19.845
What do you think
he wore this for?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.286
That's a wolfsangel.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.086
Isn't this Officer Acker?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.244
Officer Acker's
part of Wesenrein.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.120
He had to have been in
on Monroe's kidnapping.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.288
He could've tipped Shaw
we were watching his house.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.691
Acker stopped me in the hallway

33:43.760 --> 33:45.046
when I was on my way over there.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.167
He was buying time.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.004
Shaw was probably dead by
the time you got there.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.081
Let's get Acker in here.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.605
No. You bring him in now,
he'll know we're onto him.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.967
I'll pull phone records,
see who he's been talking to.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.567
If we've got a Wesen cop playing
us, he's gonna regret it.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.287
I need to use the bathroom.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.167
Hey!

34:13.960 --> 34:15.530
Shut the hell up!

34:15.600 --> 34:17.045
Come on, man. Bathroom.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.485
If my brother wasn't around,
you'd be dead by now.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.929
The guy in charge
is your brother?

34:35.639 --> 34:36.926
Grand Master.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.847
Of course, I don't pay much
attention to that Master crap.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.888
In here, I'm the master.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.571
Your master.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.763
Try anything and I will cut
you into little pieces

34:54.840 --> 34:57.366
and mail you to
your bitch Fuchsbau.

34:57.440 --> 34:58.851
Move!

34:59.800 --> 35:00.881
My knees!

35:00.960 --> 35:02.450
Oh, ow.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.601
Must have hurt.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.161
Get up!

35:34.400 --> 35:35.640
Come on!

36:34.720 --> 36:36.131
Oh, my God.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.041
What the...

36:40.520 --> 36:41.521
What...

36:42.440 --> 36:43.680
Oh, my God.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.446
No! No!

36:46.880 --> 36:47.961
No!

36:50.640 --> 36:54.167
I got a 1:45 a.m. call to
Shaw's house from Acker.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.810
That's right after
we let Shaw walk.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.928
And before that, he made a
call to Harold Johnson,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.126
who's on our Wesenrein list.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.281
Okay, this is weird.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.125
Although based on the last
24 hours, what isn't?

37:03.280 --> 37:06.489
Acker made 13 calls
to Oregon State Penitentiary.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.483
Last call was
made five weeks ago.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.403
First call,
six months before that.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.484
Let's call the warden, see
who Acker's been talking to.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.888
You son of a bitch!

37:30.480 --> 37:31.720
Look what you did to me!

37:40.080 --> 37:41.809
What are you gonna do, Jonah?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.527
The tribunal
decides his fate, not you.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.565
You upset my little brother.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.600
You filth!

38:07.800 --> 38:09.245
What you did to Terry...

38:09.320 --> 38:12.483
He brought this upon himself,
just like you.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.967
You have no respect
for your heritage.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.401
Let's get things ready.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.122
Time to answer for your sins.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.961
All Acker's calls were made to
an inmate named Walker Williams.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.040
You know who he is?

38:30.120 --> 38:32.202
Couldn't make a connection with
Acker, except for the phone calls.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.089
Acker visited him
eight times in prison.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.241
What's he in for?

38:35.320 --> 38:36.367
Four years for armed robbery.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.010
So, why is Acker
calling and visiting

38:38.080 --> 38:39.640
a guy in prison he
doesn't seem to know?

38:39.680 --> 38:42.126
Well, could be Williams who's
making the calls for the Wesenrein.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.565
Then he'd know where Monroe is.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.530
All right.
Get to Williams, fast.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.601
Did Nick call?

39:00.720 --> 39:01.881
No, nothing yet.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.366
I fell asleep.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.889
Good.
You needed the rest.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.530
I have to go home.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.281
What?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.362
Monroe doesn't have his phone,
he has no way of reaching me.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.442
If he's trying to get home,
I need to be there.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.126
No, Rosalee, it is not safe
for you to go back there.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.326
I don't care.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.243
Let them come after me,
'cause if they do...

39:21.320 --> 39:23.891
Here, look. I thought of something
while you were sleeping.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.126
That's the list that Trubel was
working on before she left.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.566
We think somebody on this list

39:28.640 --> 39:30.051
knew somebody who
was at your wedding.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.805
And that person might be the
connection to the Wesenrein.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.968
So, somebody on
this list betrayed us?

39:38.200 --> 39:39.725
Wesenrein?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.040
Am I supposed to
know what that is?

39:41.120 --> 39:43.122
Well, you know Jesse Acker.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.641
He called you 13 times,
and visited you eight.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.371
He knows about Wesenrein. So,
we're pretty sure you do, too.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.568
How did you meet him?
I forget.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.961
He called you 13 times,
visited you eight more.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.405
You don't
remember how you met him?

39:54.480 --> 39:55.561
I meet a lot of people.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.165
Really? You meet
a lot of cops in here?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.488
What are you talking about?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.289
You didn't know
Acker was a police officer?

40:01.560 --> 40:02.561
He's a cop?

40:02.640 --> 40:04.051
Yeah, and he rolled on you.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.281
I got nothing to do with them.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.646
With who?
The Wesenrein.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.205
I mean,
I've heard of 'em, but...

40:10.280 --> 40:11.930
The Wesenrein
kidnapped a friend of ours.

40:12.040 --> 40:15.169
We know Acker was involved, which
means, now, you are involved.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.931
And if anything happens to him,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.840
you're never stepping foot
outside this prison.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.760
A Grimm?

40:24.840 --> 40:25.841
No!

40:26.520 --> 40:28.329
Help! Help!

40:29.360 --> 40:30.771
Tell us what you know.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.683
I mean, I had nothin'
to do with any of it.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.880
I was only taking calls for
Charlie 'cause he made me.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.448
And the visits? Those, too.
Charlie who?

40:37.520 --> 40:38.931
Charlie Riken.
He was my cell mate.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.525
They call him the Grand Master.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.325
He's crazy, man. He believes
in all that Wesenrein voodoo.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.084
He would've killed me
if I didn't do what he asked.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.480
Why did he have
you talk to Acker?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.443
Riken didn't want
anything traced back to him.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.931
I passed
the names on to Charlie.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.445
It was Charlie who
told Acker who to punish.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.931
Riken still your cell mate?

40:53.040 --> 40:55.520
What are you talking about?
Charlie was released a month ago.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.087
I'll get the last known.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.929
Just don't tell
Charlie I told you, okay?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.889
Don't tell Charlie it was me that
told you, though, all right?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.527
Hold up. Easy. Hey, man, you
can't tell him it was me!

41:07.360 --> 41:08.407
Wu.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.046
Clear.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.447
Nothing down here.
We're running out of time.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.481
I got a phone.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.206
Wesenrein.

42:04.680 --> 42:09.680
Wesenrein!
Wesenrein! Wesenrein!
