<b><i>Play dumb.</i></b>

00:14.910 --> 00:16.140
<b><i>That's right...</i></b>

00:16.140 --> 00:19.250
<b><i>He likes Gon, so he'll bail us out.</i></b>

00:20.840 --> 00:21.880
<b><i>Idiot!</i></b>

00:24.310 --> 00:26.360
<b><i>Oh... Oops.</i></b>

00:26.360 --> 00:27.530
<b>What is it?</b>

00:27.530 --> 00:29.250
<b>You know someone here?</b>

00:29.600 --> 00:31.760
<b>Ah! No...</b>

00:34.630 --> 00:36.090
<b>It's that girl!</b>

00:36.090 --> 00:38.640
<b>Oh? You know them, Shizuku?</b>

00:39.250 --> 00:41.210
<b>Nope, never seen them before.</b>

00:41.210 --> 00:41.890
<b>Huh?</b>

00:42.220 --> 00:44.510
<b>Oh, I remember...</b>

00:44.510 --> 00:46.650
<b>It's the arm wrestling kid.</b>

00:46.650 --> 00:48.490
<b>Who was that?</b>

00:48.490 --> 00:52.550
<b>Two days ago, you lost to 
that kid at arm wrestling.</b>

00:52.550 --> 00:54.530
<b>Lost? I lost?</b>

00:55.130 --> 00:56.230
<b>That's a lie.</b>

00:56.230 --> 00:58.780
<b>I would never lose to a kid.</b>

00:59.150 --> 01:02.760
<b>Well, you were using your right hand...</b>

01:02.760 --> 01:05.040
<b>Why? I'm left-handed.</b>

01:05.370 --> 01:06.540
<b>Don't bother.</b>

01:06.540 --> 01:10.360
<b>Once Shizuku's forgotten something, 
she'll never remember.</b>

01:10.360 --> 01:13.280
<b>Never mind... I was mistaken.</b>

01:13.280 --> 01:14.170
<b>Thought so.</b>

01:14.500 --> 01:15.690
<b>Oh?</b>

01:15.690 --> 01:17.900
<b>You actually beat Shizuku?</b>

01:17.900 --> 01:18.800
<b>Yeah.</b>

01:18.800 --> 01:21.930
<b>Never would've imagined she 
was a Troupe member.</b>

01:22.600 --> 01:25.270
<b>Okay, I'll challenge you.</b>

02:46.020 --> 02:51.060
<b>Ally x And x Sword</b>

02:53.050 --> 02:54.270
<b>One more time.</b>

02:57.890 --> 02:59.280
<b>Ready...</b>

02:59.670 --> 03:00.530
<b>Go.</b>

03:13.720 --> 03:15.380
<b>One more time.</b>

03:18.960 --> 03:20.380
<b>Ready...</b>

03:21.260 --> 03:21.950
<b>Go.</b>

03:27.110 --> 03:28.060
<b>Hey...</b>

03:28.640 --> 03:30.720
<b>When it comes to arm wrestling,</b>

03:30.720 --> 03:32.860
<b>what's my rank among the spiders?</b>

03:34.240 --> 03:36.860
<b>Seventh or eighth?</b>

03:36.860 --> 03:39.900
<b>You're not weak, but you're 
not strong, either.</b>

03:40.480 --> 03:45.120
<b>And the strongest was this guy called Uvogin.</b>

03:45.690 --> 03:48.910
<b>But apparently, he was 
killed by the chain user.</b>

03:49.490 --> 03:52.150
<b>We already said we don't know who that is!</b>

03:52.150 --> 03:53.050
<b>Kid!</b>

03:55.020 --> 03:57.250
<b>If you speak without permission again,</b>

03:58.720 --> 04:00.550
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

04:04.110 --> 04:05.610
<b>One more time.</b>

04:06.710 --> 04:08.060
<b>Ready...</b>

04:08.820 --> 04:09.820
<b>Go.</b>

04:13.590 --> 04:15.580
<b>He was an Enhancer.</b>

04:16.190 --> 04:19.530
<b>Simple-minded and straightforward, 
he loved a good, all-out fight.</b>

04:20.080 --> 04:23.310
<b>But he was fussy about time.</b>

04:23.310 --> 04:25.410
<b>He'd get into fights</b>

04:25.410 --> 04:28.120
<b>with Franklin and me when we were late.</b>

04:28.120 --> 04:32.290
<b>He'd beat the crap out of me 
in an unarmed brawl...</b>

04:33.040 --> 04:35.550
<b>I've known him since before 
the Troupe was founded.</b>

04:36.410 --> 04:38.290
<b>I know him better than anyone.</b>

04:39.820 --> 04:41.010
<b>He would never...</b>

04:41.780 --> 04:45.490
<b>Uvo would never lose in a fight!</b>

04:45.920 --> 04:48.950
<b>He must've been caught in some dirty trap!</b>

04:50.740 --> 04:53.060
<b>I will make his killer pay.</b>

04:54.390 --> 04:57.180
<b>I'll find him, no matter 
how many I have to kill.</b>

04:58.100 --> 05:02.250
<b>The chain user bears a 
strong grudge against us.</b>

05:02.250 --> 05:05.980
<b>The Mafia's Nostrade Family 
hired him recently.</b>

05:06.640 --> 05:08.010
<b><i>A grudge against the Troupe?</i></b>

05:08.410 --> 05:09.990
<b><i>Recently hired...</i></b>

05:11.410 --> 05:15.030
<b>You might not know him directly, 
but you may have heard stories of him!</b>

05:15.410 --> 05:17.270
<b>Think hard...</b>

05:17.270 --> 05:20.340
<b>If you have any guesses, spill them!</b>

05:20.760 --> 05:22.100
<b>I don't know anything.</b>

05:22.580 --> 05:26.340
<b>But even if I did, I would never tell you!</b>

05:26.930 --> 05:29.950
<b>I thought you were a bunch 
of heartless monsters,</b>

05:31.130 --> 05:33.400
<b>but you'll mourn the death 
of one of your own?</b>

05:35.590 --> 05:37.810
<b>Why couldn't you spare...</b>

05:37.810 --> 05:41.230
<b>Spare a fraction of that grief...</b>

05:41.230 --> 05:45.190
<b>for the people you've killed?!</b>

05:55.910 --> 05:58.210
<b>You're getting too cocky.</b>

06:00.210 --> 06:01.170
<b>Gon!</b>

06:09.000 --> 06:10.930
<b>Another step, and I'll cut you up.</b>

06:11.340 --> 06:13.260
<b>Answer the question.</b>

06:13.790 --> 06:15.680
<b>Do you know who the chain user is?</b>

06:16.040 --> 06:19.940
<b>I already said I have nothing to tell you!</b>

06:22.420 --> 06:23.360
<b>Feitan...</b>

06:25.060 --> 06:25.970
<b>Stop.</b>

06:26.360 --> 06:27.820
<b>Stop what?</b>

06:28.820 --> 06:30.820
<b>Stop what you're about to do.</b>

06:31.170 --> 06:34.540
<b>You know what I'm about to do?</b>

06:35.290 --> 06:36.830
<b>You're going to break his arm, right?</b>

06:37.290 --> 06:39.170
<b>I'd start with a finger...</b>

06:39.170 --> 06:40.830
<b>Peel off a nail.</b>

06:41.340 --> 06:42.990
<b>Doesn't matter where you'd start.</b>

06:42.990 --> 06:44.210
<b>Just stop!</b>

06:44.650 --> 06:46.520
<b>Why are you giving me orders?</b>

06:46.520 --> 06:48.420
<b>I have no reason to listen to you.</b>

06:58.250 --> 07:00.980
<b>Hey, quit it, Nobunaga.</b>

07:01.530 --> 07:03.680
<b>Have you forgotten the rules?</b>

07:04.170 --> 07:06.900
<b>Troupe members aren't allowed 
to start serious fights.</b>

07:06.900 --> 07:08.370
<b>I know!</b>

07:08.890 --> 07:10.570
<b>If there's a dispute, we flip a coin.</b>

07:15.330 --> 07:16.220
<b>Tails.</b>

07:16.740 --> 07:17.830
<b>Heads!</b>

07:22.380 --> 07:23.510
<b>It's heads.</b>

07:23.910 --> 07:24.840
<b>Let him go.</b>

07:29.360 --> 07:31.580
<b>So, what do we do with them?</b>

07:32.100 --> 07:34.800
<b>They haven't told us anything 
about the chain user yet.</b>

07:35.230 --> 07:38.090
<b>If they don't know anything, 
we can let them go.</b>

07:38.580 --> 07:39.930
<b>Well, Pakunoda?</b>

07:40.490 --> 07:42.940
<b>I checked on the trip here.</b>

07:43.540 --> 07:46.320
<b>They really don't know anything.</b>

07:47.500 --> 07:48.400
<b>You're sure?</b>

07:48.690 --> 07:49.320
<b>Yes.</b>

07:50.070 --> 07:52.570
<b>They have no memories of the chain user.</b>

07:54.240 --> 07:56.860
<b>Seems your instinct was off this time.</b>

07:56.860 --> 07:58.580
<b>That's odd...</b>

07:58.580 --> 08:02.150
<b>Well, if Pakunoda says so, it must be true.</b>

08:12.790 --> 08:13.930
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

08:13.930 --> 08:16.180
<b>Did they do anything to you 
on the way over here?</b>

08:16.180 --> 08:18.890
<b>No, they just asked me a few questions.</b>

08:19.390 --> 08:20.220
<b>Thought so...</b>

08:20.890 --> 08:24.200
<b><i>Then they learned what they wanted 
without our realizing.</i></b>

08:24.200 --> 08:26.110
<b><i>What was it? And how?</i></b>

08:26.840 --> 08:31.610
<b><i>Sounds like they really trust 
Pakunoda's judgment.</i></b>

08:32.400 --> 08:35.260
<b><i>She must possess a skill more 
convincing than mere instinct.</i></b>

08:36.540 --> 08:39.520
<b><i>They have no memories of the chain user.</i></b>

08:40.010 --> 08:40.870
<b><i>Memories?</i></b>

08:41.840 --> 08:43.520
<b><i>How about you?</i></b>

08:43.520 --> 08:44.500
<b><i>Any guesses?</i></b>

08:45.320 --> 08:47.180
<b><i>The power to scan someone's memory!</i></b>

08:47.180 --> 08:48.740
<b><i>By touching them?</i></b>

08:50.320 --> 08:52.290
<b><i>That would explain everything.</i></b>

08:52.290 --> 08:53.720
<b><i>And we're in trouble.</i></b>

08:54.810 --> 08:58.750
<b><i>When she scanned us before, I had 
no idea who the chain user was.</i></b>

08:59.400 --> 09:02.270
<b><i>But now, I have an image in my head.</i></b>

09:03.780 --> 09:06.270
<b><i>If she checks again...</i></b>

09:06.790 --> 09:08.900
<b>If they have nothing to do 
with the chain user,</b>

09:08.900 --> 09:10.780
<b>we can let them go?</b>

09:11.280 --> 09:14.280
<b>Yeah, there's no point 
in keeping them here.</b>

09:14.710 --> 09:17.340
<b>No, we can't be sure they're 
completely unrelated.</b>

09:17.870 --> 09:20.490
<b>It's possible they're being used.</b>

09:21.110 --> 09:24.750
<b>If the chain user typically conceals his chains,</b>

09:25.300 --> 09:29.250
<b>they wouldn't realize he was the chain user.</b>

09:29.700 --> 09:33.760
<b>We shouldn't release them until they 
tell us who they're working for.</b>

09:34.200 --> 09:35.970
<b>Assuming they're working for someone else,</b>

09:35.970 --> 09:38.010
<b>it wouldn't be the chain user.</b>

09:38.010 --> 09:40.260
<b>Because he operates alone.</b>

09:40.810 --> 09:43.320
<b>Then you agree with Nobunaga.</b>

09:43.320 --> 09:45.690
<b>Rather than use a couple of kids,</b>

09:45.690 --> 09:49.520
<b>we can find the information we need 
through the Nostrade Family.</b>

09:49.980 --> 09:53.630
<b>Since we know the chain user's a member.</b>

09:54.100 --> 09:55.280
<b>That's true.</b>

09:55.900 --> 09:58.300
<b>Our target is the chain user.</b>

09:59.060 --> 10:01.080
<b>We should ignore everyone else.</b>

10:01.700 --> 10:03.050
<b>There you go.</b>

10:03.050 --> 10:04.040
<b>You kids are lucky.</b>

10:05.980 --> 10:07.290
<b>No, not yet.</b>

10:09.930 --> 10:11.790
<b>I won't let him leave.</b>

10:13.000 --> 10:14.420
<b>Kid...</b>

10:14.420 --> 10:15.690
<b>Join the spiders.</b>

10:16.510 --> 10:18.300
<b>Team up with me.</b>

10:18.670 --> 10:19.860
<b>No way.</b>

10:19.860 --> 10:23.810
<b>I'd rather die than join you guys!</b>

10:25.600 --> 10:27.880
<b>He really hates us...</b>

10:27.880 --> 10:29.810
<b>You're an Enhancer, right?</b>

10:30.670 --> 10:32.060
<b>What if I am?!</b>

10:32.490 --> 10:34.380
<b>I knew it!</b>

10:41.140 --> 10:42.130
<b>Hey!</b>

10:42.130 --> 10:45.080
<b>We're keeping them here 
until the boss gets back.</b>

10:45.800 --> 10:47.630
<b>I'm going to recommend we recruit them.</b>

10:47.630 --> 10:49.040
<b>Are you serious?</b>

10:49.040 --> 10:51.330
<b>The boss will never agree to that.</b>

10:52.590 --> 10:54.100
<b>Well, it's your call.</b>

10:54.560 --> 10:56.090
<b>But you have to watch them.</b>

10:57.110 --> 10:59.250
<b>You can't blame us if they escape.</b>

11:04.530 --> 11:07.190
<b>He reminds you of Uvo?</b>

11:07.190 --> 11:10.170
<b>Yeah, he wears his emotions on his sleeve.</b>

11:10.170 --> 11:13.060
<b>And when he's angry, 
he forgets about consequences.</b>

11:13.470 --> 11:15.050
<b>Most of all,</b>

11:15.050 --> 11:18.570
<b>he's strongest when fighting 
for someone else.</b>

11:19.490 --> 11:22.960
<b>He did like to fight alone.</b>

11:22.960 --> 11:24.360
<b>But he was strongest</b>

11:24.360 --> 11:27.830
<b>when he'd team up with 
Nobunaga to fight a horde.</b>

11:28.380 --> 11:30.280
<b>Uvo never admitted it,</b>

11:30.280 --> 11:33.930
<b>but he preferred having 
someone to protect.</b>

11:33.930 --> 11:36.890
<b>Then, he was stronger with 
someone holding him back.</b>

11:36.890 --> 11:39.090
<b>Well, I guess you could say that.</b>

11:39.360 --> 11:42.130
<b>Shizuku is always so uncharitable...</b>

11:42.130 --> 11:45.940
<b>On the other hand, Nobunaga's 
skills are superior for duels.</b>

11:45.940 --> 11:48.850
<b>You could even say that they're 
really only effective one-on-one.</b>

11:49.670 --> 11:53.590
<b>Whenever they had assignments to fight 
together, they always complained.</b>

11:53.590 --> 11:55.820
<b>But in truth, they seemed to enjoy it.</b>

11:55.820 --> 11:56.360
<b>Okay,</b>

11:56.770 --> 11:58.680
<b>that's enough reminiscing.</b>

11:58.680 --> 12:00.110
<b>Let's get down to business.</b>

12:00.430 --> 12:02.970
<b>Here's a list of Nostrade Family members</b>

12:02.970 --> 12:05.620
<b>taken from the Hunter website.</b>

12:06.110 --> 12:08.680
<b>These five are particularly important.</b>

12:08.680 --> 12:12.560
<b>They serve as bodyguards for 
the daughter of the boss.</b>

12:12.560 --> 12:14.630
<b>And they're the ones who captured Uvo.</b>

12:15.450 --> 12:19.450
<b>But Uvo said that the chain 
user wasn't on this list.</b>

12:19.960 --> 12:22.120
<b>Since we don't know the 
chain user's appearance,</b>

12:22.120 --> 12:23.880
<b>we'll have to find someone who does.</b>

12:24.180 --> 12:26.580
<b>Oh, that's the guy I killed.</b>

12:26.580 --> 12:28.890
<b>Cross out the top left guy.</b>

12:29.320 --> 12:31.330
<b>Move around in pairs,</b>

12:31.330 --> 12:34.370
<b>and search for the people on that list.</b>

12:35.430 --> 12:39.410
<b>Then we'll meet back here 
at 10 PM. That's all.</b>

12:40.830 --> 12:41.650
<b>Wait.</b>

12:42.220 --> 12:44.060
<b>Nobunaga's staying here, right?</b>

12:44.060 --> 12:45.030
<b>What should I do?</b>

12:46.120 --> 12:48.530
<b>You can team up with whoever's left.</b>

13:00.900 --> 13:02.170
<b>Ow...</b>

13:02.740 --> 13:03.720
<b><i>I was a fool.</i></b>

13:04.220 --> 13:06.100
<b><i>If I'd made a move,</i></b>

13:06.100 --> 13:09.120
<b><i>Hisoka wouldn't have hesitated to kill me.</i></b>

13:09.990 --> 13:11.310
<b><i>That murderous aura...</i></b>

13:11.640 --> 13:12.640
<b><i>I was frozen in place.</i></b>

13:13.560 --> 13:16.500
<b><i>If Gon had suffered a lethal blow,</i></b>

13:17.030 --> 13:19.670
<b><i>would I have been able to move?</i></b>

13:20.130 --> 13:21.570
<b><i>That's impossible.</i></b>

13:23.080 --> 13:28.320
<b><i>Your only concern when you meet someone 
is whether you should kill them.</i></b>

13:28.590 --> 13:29.580
<b><i>You're wrong...</i></b>

13:29.900 --> 13:32.490
<b><i>"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."</i></b>

13:32.830 --> 13:35.380
<b><i>I drilled that into you...</i></b>

13:35.870 --> 13:36.710
<b>You're wrong!</b>

13:43.670 --> 13:45.340
<b>Scary...</b>

13:46.020 --> 13:48.130
<b>You look like you want to kill me.</b>

13:49.550 --> 13:51.220
<b>Let me warn you first.</b>

13:51.220 --> 13:54.730
<b>Step into range, and I'll cut you down.</b>

13:57.070 --> 13:58.230
<b>Killua!</b>

14:32.550 --> 14:34.550
<b><i>I stand no chance against him.</i></b>

14:35.040 --> 14:37.270
<b><i>I have to think of a way to escape...</i></b>

14:38.500 --> 14:39.800
<b><i>No windows.</i></b>

14:40.790 --> 14:42.240
<b><i>One exit.</i></b>

14:42.920 --> 14:46.780
<b><i>How can we get him to move away?</i></b>

14:50.570 --> 14:53.280
<b>Is Leorio okay?</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:56.930
<b>I hope he was able to find Zepile-san.</b>

14:58.120 --> 14:59.920
<b>Killua, are you okay?</b>

15:00.930 --> 15:01.920
<b>Yeah.</b>

15:07.710 --> 15:08.690
<b>Hey,</b>

15:08.690 --> 15:13.340
<b>Zepile-san taught us welding, exposing...</b>

15:13.340 --> 15:14.860
<b>What else was there?</b>

15:15.530 --> 15:16.430
<b>I forgot.</b>

15:16.820 --> 15:19.260
<b>Side-stomping, maybe?</b>

15:19.260 --> 15:21.510
<b>I don't think that was it...</b>

15:21.510 --> 15:22.160
<b>Gon...</b>

15:24.000 --> 15:25.570
<b>I'll act as a decoy.</b>

15:26.000 --> 15:28.690
<b>Use that chance to escape.</b>

15:29.840 --> 15:31.200
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

15:31.480 --> 15:32.730
<b>Seriously.</b>

15:33.130 --> 15:34.330
<b>Forget it.</b>

15:34.990 --> 15:38.610
<b>You're smart enough to know 
how much stronger I am.</b>

15:39.100 --> 15:40.830
<b>There won't be any chances.</b>

15:41.350 --> 15:43.330
<b><i>I already know that!</i></b>

15:44.160 --> 15:47.060
<b><i>This room only has one exit 
and nowhere to hide.</i></b>

15:47.440 --> 15:49.570
<b><i>He can see everything we're doing.</i></b>

15:49.570 --> 15:53.090
<b><i>We're facing someone who can watch 
us without creating an opening.</i></b>

15:54.030 --> 15:55.990
<b><i>He's probably an iaido master.</i></b>

15:55.990 --> 15:59.570
<b><i>With his shodachi, his range 
is at least two times mine.</i></b>

16:00.240 --> 16:03.350
<b><i>If I take one step too close, 
he'll strike a fatal blow.</i></b>

16:04.060 --> 16:05.740
<b><i>But that's the point!</i></b>

16:06.120 --> 16:08.190
<b><i>You can't do it.</i></b>

16:09.240 --> 16:10.420
<b>Shut up!</b>

16:11.510 --> 16:13.820
<b>I won't know until I try!</b>

16:16.920 --> 16:19.330
<b>Killua, what are you thinking?</b>

16:19.760 --> 16:23.080
<b>I'll stop his shodachi, even if it kills me.</b>

16:23.080 --> 16:25.140
<b>Use that chance to run away!</b>

16:27.940 --> 16:28.590
<b>Huh?</b>

16:29.030 --> 16:30.640
<b>What was that for?!</b>

16:30.640 --> 16:32.320
<b>Don't be so selfish!</b>

16:33.420 --> 16:36.170
<b>Don't talk about dying like it's nothing!</b>

16:36.170 --> 16:37.250
<b>What?!</b>

16:37.250 --> 16:39.350
<b>You did the same thing earlier!</b>

16:39.350 --> 16:40.600
<b>I'm allowed to do it!</b>

16:40.930 --> 16:42.480
<b>But you aren't!</b>

16:42.910 --> 16:43.980
<b>Huh?</b>

16:46.860 --> 16:49.860
<b>You can't use logic against an Enhancer...</b>

16:50.440 --> 16:54.330
<b>We can't escape unless we're 
prepared to die, stupid!</b>

16:54.330 --> 16:56.860
<b>You have no idea what I was thinking...</b>

16:56.860 --> 16:58.120
<b>Who's the selfish one?!</b>

16:58.120 --> 17:00.490
<b>Yes, I've no idea... 
Because I'm stupid!</b>

17:02.880 --> 17:05.120
<b>You kids are hilarious!</b>

17:05.120 --> 17:07.520
<b>Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything.</b>

17:07.520 --> 17:09.310
<b>Just behave yourselves.</b>

17:09.310 --> 17:11.260
<b>I know you're serious.</b>

17:11.760 --> 17:13.270
<b>Don't throw your lives away.</b>

17:14.640 --> 17:16.710
<b>Wait until the boss gets back.</b>

17:17.160 --> 17:20.760
<b>If he won't give his approval, you can leave.</b>

17:22.050 --> 17:24.330
<b>But if you try to escape, I'll kill you.</b>

17:25.140 --> 17:26.990
<b>Don't make me draw my sword.</b>

17:27.470 --> 17:29.650
<b>If I pull it out, you'll die...</b>

17:32.650 --> 17:34.240
<b>I remember now!</b>

17:34.240 --> 17:36.360
<b>It was side-stepping!</b>

17:36.360 --> 17:38.160
<b>Welding, exposing...</b>

17:38.770 --> 17:40.660
<b>And the last one was side-stepping!</b>

17:43.950 --> 17:45.350
<b>Do you remember now?</b>

17:45.350 --> 17:47.540
<b>Yeah, I sure do!</b>

17:47.880 --> 17:48.850
<b>See?</b>

17:48.850 --> 17:51.550
<b>How could we forget something so simple?</b>

17:51.890 --> 17:52.610
<b>Huh?</b>

17:54.260 --> 17:56.000
<b>Now that we've figured that out...</b>

17:56.720 --> 17:57.550
<b>Let's go!</b>

17:57.900 --> 17:59.090
<b>Are you serious?</b>

17:59.900 --> 18:01.310
<b>You're going to die.</b>

18:01.310 --> 18:04.200
<b>I'm not skilled or merciful enough</b>

18:04.200 --> 18:06.380
<b>to control my strength.</b>

18:09.850 --> 18:10.810
<b>Fools!</b>

18:15.660 --> 18:17.740
<b><i>If the exit is blocked...</i></b>

18:18.120 --> 18:20.150
<b><i>Make your own!</i></b>

18:21.180 --> 18:22.260
<b><i>The wall...</i></b>

18:22.880 --> 18:25.450
<b><i>Tsk, which one do I chase?</i></b>

18:25.450 --> 18:26.660
<b><i>We're on the fifth floor.</i></b>

18:27.240 --> 18:29.630
<b><i>The kid with slanted eyes 
is already close to the stairs.</i></b>

18:30.400 --> 18:31.380
<b><i>So the black-haired kid!</i></b>

18:33.470 --> 18:37.010
<b><i>Now he has nowhere to run.</i></b>

18:38.360 --> 18:39.390
<b><i>Am I an idiot?</i></b>

18:40.110 --> 18:42.760
<b><i>They can break through walls to escape!</i></b>

18:45.240 --> 18:46.500
<b><i>The slanted-eyed kid is below.</i></b>

18:46.990 --> 18:48.770
<b><i>I'll have to follow the black-haired one.</i></b>

18:52.820 --> 18:53.770
<b><i>Where is he?</i></b>

18:54.380 --> 18:56.420
<b><i>The walls are intact...</i></b>

18:56.420 --> 18:57.400
<b><i>So is the door.</i></b>

18:57.400 --> 18:59.280
<b>Killua, are you there?</b>

19:01.000 --> 19:02.780
<b>Yeah, I'm here!</b>

19:03.540 --> 19:04.820
<b><i>That's it!</i></b>

19:04.820 --> 19:07.320
<b><i>That last hole was a decoy!</i></b>

19:07.320 --> 19:11.320
<b><i>He broke it before hiding in the nearby room,</i></b>

19:11.320 --> 19:12.780
<b><i>waiting for me to pass,</i></b>

19:13.360 --> 19:14.800
<b><i>before stepping into the hallway.</i></b>

19:15.230 --> 19:17.800
<b>We can beat him together!</b>

19:22.060 --> 19:25.060
<b><i>His presence disappeared...</i> Zetsu?</b>

19:25.660 --> 19:28.560
<b><i>Does the idiot want to fight me?</i></b>

19:29.330 --> 19:31.980
<b><i>An advanced application of</i> Ten <i>and</i> Ren.</b>

19:34.340 --> 19:35.270
<b><i>En!</i></b>

19:35.020 --> 19:36.070
<b>En</b>

19:36.070 --> 19:38.780
<b><i>Normally, you shroud your body in aura</i></b>

19:38.780 --> 19:41.760
<b><i>that extends a few 
millimeters from your body.</i></b>

19:41.760 --> 19:44.830
<b><i>But with</i> En<i>, you extend that 
aura as far as necessary.</i></b>

19:45.700 --> 19:48.590
<b><i>You can sense anyone who 
steps inside your</i> En.</b>

19:48.590 --> 19:51.530
<b><i>Inside it, you can even count 
the leaves as they fall.</i></b>

19:53.780 --> 19:56.710
<b><i>You can conceal your presence and approach,</i></b>

19:56.710 --> 19:59.150
<b><i>never making a sound.</i></b>

19:59.150 --> 20:02.220
<b><i>But step within my </i>En, 
<i>and I'll swing my sword.</i></b>

20:03.300 --> 20:05.220
<b><i>Come to me.</i></b>

20:07.190 --> 20:08.220
<b>Stupid.</b>

20:08.220 --> 20:11.680
<b>Man, I wanted to beat him up.</b>

20:11.680 --> 20:13.320
<b>That was impossible.</b>

20:13.320 --> 20:15.230
<b>He'd have fought you off and killed you.</b>

20:15.470 --> 20:17.190
<b>One hundred percent guaranteed?</b>

20:17.190 --> 20:18.980
<b>We don't have a chance</b>

20:19.160 --> 20:21.020
<b>only knowing the basics of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

20:23.280 --> 20:24.320
<b>What is it?</b>

20:24.320 --> 20:26.250
<b>You finally sound like yourself again.</b>

20:26.720 --> 20:28.820
<b>It's my job to say crazy stuff.</b>

20:28.820 --> 20:31.720
<b>Your job is to stay cool and stop me.</b>

20:32.610 --> 20:34.390
<b>So I'm counting on you!</b>

20:34.390 --> 20:35.750
<b>You're so selfish.</b>

20:36.390 --> 20:39.020
<b>Well? What do we do next?</b>

20:39.020 --> 20:41.260
<b>That depends on what you want to do.</b>

20:41.570 --> 20:44.020
<b>I want to defeat those guys.</b>

20:44.020 --> 20:47.640
<b>Well, that matches our original objective.</b>

20:48.340 --> 20:52.640
<b>But we'll have to improve our <i>Nen</i> to do that.</b>

20:52.640 --> 20:55.960
<b><i>Nen</i> has the potential to give us the power</b>

20:55.960 --> 20:57.610
<b>we'd need to stand a chance.</b>

20:59.920 --> 21:04.150
<b>And the fastest way to learn more 
would be to ask Kurapika.</b>

21:04.150 --> 21:06.100
<b>Huh? Why?</b>

21:06.100 --> 21:10.390
<b>Because Kurapika is the chain user 
who defeated one of them.</b>

21:10.390 --> 21:11.290
<b>Huh?</b>

21:11.290 --> 21:13.300
<b>You didn't realize it?</b>

21:13.300 --> 21:15.170
<b>Is that really true?</b>

21:15.680 --> 21:17.170
<b>I'm pretty confident.</b>

21:17.170 --> 21:19.920
<b>If it's true, we have a chance.</b>

21:20.980 --> 21:24.170
<b>Because we learned <i>Nen</i> around 
the same time Kurapika did.</b>

21:24.630 --> 21:26.410
<b>We need to learn the techniques</b>

21:26.410 --> 21:28.050
<b>appropriate to our abilities.</b>

21:28.730 --> 21:30.310
<b>And most importantly,</b>

21:30.310 --> 21:33.680
<b>we need the strength to fight the Troupe.</b>

21:33.680 --> 21:37.930
<b>And Kurapika is the key to 
finding those answers?</b>

21:37.980 --> 21:38.610
<b>Yeah.</b>

21:44.100 --> 21:47.210
<b>At the same time, a new storm brews</b>
