- <i>Previously on "Legends"...</i>
- I am Dmitry Petrovich.

00:03.140 --> 00:05.414
- And you all work for me now.
- Dmitry?

00:05.449 --> 00:06.469
Who is that guy, really?

00:06.504 --> 00:08.589
Why in the name of Christ is there
not an international manhunt...

00:08.624 --> 00:09.127
Enough!

00:09.162 --> 00:12.939
With your product and my
contacts, we become very rich.

00:12.974 --> 00:14.102
You have big balls.

00:14.137 --> 00:15.954
If you betray me,
I'll cut them off.

00:15.989 --> 00:17.479
You should pray, too.

00:18.697 --> 00:20.642
Now you want
to embrace your true faith.

00:20.676 --> 00:22.027
I want to finally
be who I really am.

00:22.062 --> 00:23.129
Am I allowed to say that...

00:23.164 --> 00:24.420
London's done right by you?

00:24.455 --> 00:25.589
Have fun with your wife.

00:25.624 --> 00:27.863
My God.
What's happened to you?

00:27.898 --> 00:30.081
Oh, I'm a whole new man
these days, Gabi.

00:30.116 --> 00:33.219
_

00:33.254 --> 00:34.624
(chuckles)

00:36.418 --> 00:37.851
Really cute.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.115
They look like you.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.875
But what about you, Curtis?

00:46.910 --> 00:48.897
Do you have a family now?

00:48.932 --> 00:51.246
Never met the right woman,
I guess.

00:53.244 --> 00:55.850
So...

00:55.885 --> 00:57.842
what brings you back to Prague?

01:03.127 --> 01:05.060
Look familiar?

01:06.469 --> 01:08.113
Our old friend.

01:08.148 --> 01:09.797
Dmitry Petrovich.

01:09.799 --> 01:11.305
I don't think
that's really his name.

01:11.340 --> 01:12.979
(chuckles):
No?

01:13.014 --> 01:14.349
Then who is he?

01:14.384 --> 01:15.283
I'm not sure,

01:15.318 --> 01:18.812
but as of 2004, he was working
undercover for the FBI,

01:18.847 --> 01:20.343
using various aliases.

01:20.378 --> 01:23.514
Martin Odum, John Cameron.

01:23.614 --> 01:24.497
Last year,

01:24.532 --> 01:29.468
Odum confessed to the killing
of the FBI Director.

01:29.503 --> 01:30.766
My God.

01:30.801 --> 01:32.240
Now he's a fugitive.

01:32.404 --> 01:32.978
My guess is

01:33.013 --> 01:36.003
he was working for the FBI
the entire time,

01:36.038 --> 01:38.159
even as far back as 2001.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.826
Wouldn't the FBI have told you
if they had someone undercover?

01:40.861 --> 01:42.553
(sighs)
No one at the Bureau

01:42.588 --> 01:44.987
will answer my questions
about Odum.

01:47.922 --> 01:51.263
You're not here
in an official capacity,

01:51.320 --> 01:52.953
are you, Curtis?

01:55.924 --> 01:58.331
You-You know what he did to me.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.195
If Dmitry was working

02:04.230 --> 02:05.484
for the FBI back then,

02:05.519 --> 02:07.214
then someone
in Czech intelligence

02:07.249 --> 02:08.401
must have known about it.

02:08.437 --> 02:10.235
Now you're a big shot now.

02:14.255 --> 02:15.913
(sighs)

02:15.948 --> 02:17.932
I'll make a few inquiries.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.107
But do me a favor, Curtis.

02:23.142 --> 02:26.043
Don't stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

02:26.490 --> 02:28.557
Okay?

Yeah, that's him.

02:50.732 --> 02:54.018
One to the head,
one to the chest... professional.

02:54.053 --> 02:55.129
I think we all know
who did this.

02:55.164 --> 02:56.204
Perhaps,

02:56.239 --> 02:57.493
but I can't bring charges

02:57.528 --> 02:59.266
simply based on a hunch.

02:59.305 --> 03:01.511
We're gonna find a way
to nail him.

03:01.546 --> 03:02.719
Careful, Ballard.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.766
These Russian mobsters believe
they're untouchable.

03:07.599 --> 03:09.599
(rock music playing)

03:10.422 --> 03:12.122
Good to see you.

03:22.521 --> 03:23.914
Cool place.

03:24.036 --> 03:25.543
Real rock and roll.

03:25.578 --> 03:27.202
Glad you enjoy.

03:27.237 --> 03:27.843
Listen,

03:27.878 --> 03:31.346
I have got three girls
just in from Thailand.

03:31.435 --> 03:34.474
They appeal to a special sort
of customer.

03:34.509 --> 03:35.766
What sort is that?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.844
The kind who likes them fresh.

03:37.908 --> 03:39.741
Oldest is 12.

03:39.776 --> 03:42.684
Get out.

03:42.719 --> 03:44.486
Get out.

03:51.343 --> 03:53.827
Hello, Dmitry.

03:53.862 --> 03:55.181
Do I know you?

03:55.216 --> 03:57.665
We'd like a word.

03:58.992 --> 04:02.103
Doing quite well
for yourself, Petrovich.

04:02.153 --> 04:04.837
Four months ago,
you opened up this club.

04:04.984 --> 04:07.360
Now I hear you have
a trucking business.

04:07.395 --> 04:09.210
Prague is great city.

04:09.245 --> 04:12.102
Many opportunity
for entrepreneur.

04:12.137 --> 04:14.778
Janic Jaros. You know him?

04:14.813 --> 04:16.738
Yes, of course.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.510
I bought his trucks.

04:18.545 --> 04:20.355
He was doing quite well.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.103
I'm surprised
he was willing to sell.

04:22.139 --> 04:23.452
Everybody has price.

04:23.487 --> 04:26.526
We fished Janic's body
out of the river this afternoon.

04:26.624 --> 04:28.296
What? (chuckles)

04:28.579 --> 04:31.499
You think I had something
to do with that?

04:31.744 --> 04:32.900
You tell us.

04:32.959 --> 04:33.796
Look around.

04:33.865 --> 04:34.912
I make people happy.

04:34.947 --> 04:36.921
I don't throw them in river.

04:38.038 --> 04:40.082
Hana.

04:40.117 --> 04:41.843
Meet my American friend

04:41.878 --> 04:43.388
from FBI.

04:43.423 --> 04:45.261
Maybe you could show him
some fun.

04:45.354 --> 04:47.210
FBI?

04:47.348 --> 04:48.837
Like the movies.

04:49.042 --> 04:51.476
Very sexy.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.639
You see?

I-I don't want to scare you.

05:46.834 --> 05:49.804
- I just want to talk...
- Stay away from me.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.958
Please.

05:51.993 --> 05:54.217
You called me Dmitry?

05:54.283 --> 05:56.241
You don't sound like him.

05:57.644 --> 05:58.183
I was injured.

05:58.218 --> 06:01.307
I-I can't remember
what happened back then.

06:01.393 --> 06:03.270
Then you're lucky.

06:03.334 --> 06:04.241
- Please, can you help me?
- No!

06:04.268 --> 06:06.500
Go now, or I'll call the police.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.586
Never contact me again.

06:13.322 --> 06:15.535
<i>NEWS ANCHOR: The man is currently being
sought by police</i>

06:15.570 --> 06:18.065
for resisting arrest
and assaulting two officers.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.816
NISCO:
Is that who I think it is?

06:20.851 --> 06:21.943
Yeah.

06:22.171 --> 06:24.204
Did you know he was here?

06:27.032 --> 06:29.215
Martin's in a real jam
right now.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.245
Okay, and that's why
I was talking to Nina.

06:32.388 --> 06:35.721
I'm not involved
with her anymore, I swear.

06:35.756 --> 06:39.108
Either way,
you're not here to be with me.

06:39.143 --> 06:40.202
No, baby, that's not true.

06:40.237 --> 06:42.494
I really did want
to go away with you, okay?

06:42.529 --> 06:44.912
I just figured that

06:44.947 --> 06:47.460
I could do Martin a solid
at the same time.

06:47.495 --> 06:48.001
He doesn't have

06:48.036 --> 06:51.096
anybody else, babe.

06:51.131 --> 06:53.642
I know, I know I screwed up, okay?
I'm sorry.

06:53.763 --> 06:56.597
Help him with what?

06:58.352 --> 07:00.628
Martin's been framed for murder.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.013
If he's caught,
he could be executed.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.848
(sighs)
I just can't abandon him.

07:10.856 --> 07:12.592
I'm gonna go home.

You call me when you're done.

<i>FBI AGENT:
Nina Brenner?</i>

07:23.465 --> 07:24.413
Special Agent Smith.

07:24.448 --> 07:26.711
This is Agent Gordon.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.092
You're a little bit out of
your jurisdiction, aren't you?

07:28.149 --> 07:31.435
You recently met with
a colleague of ours, Tony Rice.

07:32.977 --> 07:34.125
- You've been spying on me?
- What's the nature

07:34.160 --> 07:35.162
of your relationship
with Agent Rice?

07:35.227 --> 07:36.895
I don't answer to the Bureau.

07:36.944 --> 07:39.896
So unless you want to tell me
what this is about...

07:39.931 --> 07:40.722
We have reason to believe

07:40.779 --> 07:42.457
Agent Rice is aiding
and abetting a man

07:42.492 --> 07:45.152
wanted for murder in the U.S.

07:45.223 --> 07:47.950
We'd hate to think you were
helping him harbor a fugitive.

07:47.985 --> 07:49.797
Because as you know,
even CIA officers

07:49.832 --> 07:52.604
are subject
to criminal prosecution.

07:54.537 --> 07:57.888
Tony and I were
in JTTF together.

07:57.923 --> 07:59.674
We had a thing.

07:59.789 --> 08:03.394
He was
a pretty good lay, actually.

08:03.429 --> 08:05.410

You know the name you found

08:25.353 --> 08:27.770
on your grandmother's
Soviet I.D.?

08:27.805 --> 08:29.684
I contacted some
of my Chechen friends.

08:29.734 --> 08:31.538
You won't believe what I found.

08:31.593 --> 08:33.047
Well, come on, tell me.

08:33.099 --> 08:34.261
I think your mother was married

08:34.328 --> 08:36.597
to a guy named Doku Zakaev.

08:37.710 --> 08:38.405
My mum told me

08:38.440 --> 08:40.738
that my dad
was a Russian soldier.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.431
Not Russian, Chechen.

08:42.511 --> 08:43.818
Mujahedeen.

08:43.903 --> 08:45.217
He fought the Russians.

08:45.255 --> 08:47.448
He was a freedom fighter
in the first Chechen war,

08:47.483 --> 08:49.273
a hero.

08:49.308 --> 08:52.406
She's such a bloody liar.

08:52.441 --> 08:53.463
How did my mum go
from being married

08:53.498 --> 08:56.403
to a man like that
to a wanker like my step-dad?

08:56.715 --> 08:58.782
Maybe she lost her faith.

08:59.803 --> 09:01.599
You know, I have a lot
of contacts online.

09:01.634 --> 09:03.403
Maybe I could find
more of your relatives.

09:03.438 --> 09:06.539
Yeah, that'd be brilliant.

09:07.398 --> 09:09.412
Sorry, I've got to run.

09:15.286 --> 09:16.683
Apparently, I speak Russian.

09:16.718 --> 09:19.433
She, uh, she called me Dmitry.

09:19.481 --> 09:21.413
Must be a legend
you used for MI6.

09:21.483 --> 09:24.041
She was terrified of me, Tony.

09:24.076 --> 09:25.292
What are you gonna do?

09:25.294 --> 09:28.279
When I was in her house,
I saw a picture of her daughter.

09:28.314 --> 09:30.383
I remembered being with her.

09:30.418 --> 09:33.076
I was in a park, and I...

09:33.111 --> 09:36.902
I remember pushing her
on a swing.

09:37.850 --> 09:39.001
You think you're her father?

09:39.036 --> 09:40.598
I don't know, I could be.

09:42.211 --> 09:44.478
Maybe I can talk to her.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.640
You sure you want
to do that, Martin?

09:46.675 --> 09:48.425
Her mother already threatened
to call the cops on you.

09:48.460 --> 09:53.123
Tony, somehow or other,
I'm connected to these people.

09:53.158 --> 09:57.691

the key to all of this.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.200
You treat me like a king.

10:17.761 --> 10:20.277
I hope your brother
appreciates this, Tamir.

10:20.312 --> 10:21.310
I also send money

10:21.345 --> 10:23.513
to Budapest and St. Petersburg.

10:23.548 --> 10:25.157
Everybody wants cut.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.550
It's a cost
of doing business, right?

10:28.585 --> 10:30.647
So...

10:30.682 --> 10:32.582
to more business.

10:32.888 --> 10:34.855
More business.

10:39.761 --> 10:41.601
What are you doing here, Tamir?

10:41.636 --> 10:42.155
Hmm?

10:42.190 --> 10:44.237
This place is insult to Allah.

10:44.272 --> 10:46.106
- <i>It's all haram.</i>
- Ah, come on, Doku.

10:46.141 --> 10:48.914
- It's a little fun.
- Shut your mouth.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.245
Come, come.

10:54.017 --> 10:55.082
Are you corrupting my brother

10:55.117 --> 10:56.211

My brother is not your friend.

11:04.118 --> 11:06.091
I am not your friend.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.929
Keep your trucks moving,

11:07.964 --> 11:10.877
make payments... that's it.

11:10.997 --> 11:13.609
Otherwise,

surprised to see you.

11:50.102 --> 11:52.090
You look, uh...

11:53.879 --> 11:55.741
Like shit.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.705
I no longer use profanity.

11:58.740 --> 11:59.864
Well, I got to say, Tamir,

11:59.899 --> 12:01.700
I, uh...

12:01.739 --> 12:05.140
I didn't expect you to do
so well for yourself.

12:05.175 --> 12:06.757
People change.

12:07.012 --> 12:09.246
Yes, they do.

12:11.220 --> 12:13.522
I'm looking for our old friend.

12:14.132 --> 12:16.257
Dmitry Petrovich.

12:16.292 --> 12:18.494
Petrovich?

12:19.085 --> 12:22.297
I haven't heard from him
in almost 15 years.

12:22.332 --> 12:24.426
You two were very close.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.775
He left a lot of money
in Prague.

12:27.868 --> 12:30.027
A bar, a trucking business.

12:30.062 --> 12:33.724
He never came back
to pull out any of his cash?

12:33.850 --> 12:36.044
I heard he was
arrested by Russians.

12:36.392 --> 12:38.226
He's probably
in Siberian prison.

12:38.261 --> 12:39.535
Who knows?
(chuckles)

12:39.570 --> 12:41.337
Maybe somebody kill him.

12:45.376 --> 12:47.051
No.

12:47.147 --> 12:49.948
He's still alive.

12:50.286 --> 12:51.686
Free.

12:56.696 --> 12:58.248
You're a pious man now.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.565
Yes.

13:01.735 --> 13:04.936
Helping me find Dmitry
might be a way

13:04.997 --> 13:07.764
to atone for all the bad
you did with him.

13:10.646 --> 13:12.493
Let me make some calls.

13:12.528 --> 13:14.798
See if anyone I know
heard from him.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.231
Now, excuse me.

13:16.266 --> 13:17.920
I have people waiting.

13:19.951 --> 13:21.264
Of course.

13:38.390 --> 13:39.996

13:40.031 --> 13:41.306

Hello?

13:41.388 --> 13:44.851
The FBI guy from 2001 is back;
you know about this?

13:44.948 --> 13:46.448
I have not heard.

13:46.517 --> 13:49.584
Make sure he doesn't
bother me again.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.780
- I would rather not get involved.
- Come on, ***.

13:53.815 --> 13:55.467
How much did we pay you,
my brother and I,

13:55.502 --> 13:56.901
over the years?

13:57.153 --> 13:59.787
Your expensive cars,
your country house.

13:59.889 --> 14:00.790
What do you want me to do?

14:00.851 --> 14:02.528
You're a councilman.
Make a phone call.

14:02.563 --> 14:05.167
Tell cops he threatened
to kill me or...

14:05.207 --> 14:06.989
I don't know.
Just get him off my ass.

14:07.024 --> 14:08.670
Okay, relax.

14:08.939 --> 14:11.173
I will take care of it.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.504
(phone beeps)

14:12.539 --> 14:17.492
You need to explain to me why
the FBI is suddenly up my ass.

14:17.549 --> 14:19.651
It's complicated.

14:21.118 --> 14:22.793
I've been passing you
classified files.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.167
Do you know
what could happen to me?

14:25.202 --> 14:27.895
Introduce me
to your contact in the Six.

14:27.934 --> 14:28.881
Why?

14:28.916 --> 14:32.208

that might help everybody.

14:40.158 --> 14:42.504
Honestly, Simon, I had no idea
this was anything more

14:42.539 --> 14:43.905
than a small favor for a friend.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.107
"A small favor."

14:46.430 --> 14:48.713
Big enough to get me canned.

14:48.748 --> 14:50.722
Well, Rice,

14:50.757 --> 14:52.997
what's your brilliant idea,
then?

14:53.032 --> 14:54.884
RICE: You need to get out ahead
of this thing before your bosses

14:54.919 --> 14:57.284
find out you've been
passing classified files.

14:57.319 --> 14:58.070
And one thing we know...

14:58.105 --> 15:00.406
we know that Martin
was MI6, right?

15:00.493 --> 15:02.979
So, I convince him
to surrender to you,

15:03.014 --> 15:04.661
then you both claim that
you were looking into his files

15:04.696 --> 15:07.216
because you were
trying to bring him in.

15:07.251 --> 15:09.784
Be a nice feather in your cap.

15:11.468 --> 15:14.180
It's not the worst idea
I ever heard.

15:14.215 --> 15:16.159
RICE:
And in exchange,

15:16.259 --> 15:18.957
you protect Martin from the FBI.

15:19.036 --> 15:21.174

American government?

15:21.270 --> 15:21.777
But that's it?

15:21.812 --> 15:24.621
He's accused of a capital crime,
okay, and unlike the U.K.,

15:24.656 --> 15:26.641
America has the death penalty.

15:27.647 --> 15:29.396
Do you want to send
an innocent man to his death?

15:29.431 --> 15:33.466
Look, I have no problem
telling the FBI to bugger off.

15:33.501 --> 15:34.541
But this plan of yours
will only work

He told us that his
name was Leo Parks.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.472
How do you know him?

15:50.879 --> 15:53.179
I don't. He claimed
he knew Dad.

15:54.610 --> 15:56.812

that his moments of lucidity
are fewer and fewer.

No. I don't remember him.

very uncomfortable for Six.

I didn't kill him.

Even deep in legend,
there are limits.

16:54.256 --> 16:56.672

are ruthless, Terrence.

17:11.026 --> 17:12.686
So?

17:13.578 --> 17:16.491
Doku is the key.

17:16.615 --> 17:19.409
If anyone's in contact
with Arsanov, it's him.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.200
- Has he mentioned Arsanov?
- Nah.

17:21.277 --> 17:22.744
Doku keeps his distance.

with the brother,

17:24.491 --> 17:26.520

17:26.555 --> 17:27.665
What kind of snag?

17:27.701 --> 17:29.504
Nothing too serious.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.308
Got an idea what to do about it.

I made a deal with Six.

40:57.083 --> 40:57.972
If you surrender,

40:58.031 --> 40:59.614
they'll protect you
from the FBI.

40:59.649 --> 41:01.751
- I can't, not now.
- So, what?

41:01.815 --> 41:03.185
You want to be on the run
for the rest of your life?

41:03.231 --> 41:04.798
What about Kate?

41:05.524 --> 41:06.455
Somebody's got to help her.

41:06.494 --> 41:08.752
Martin, you're a wanted man,
for Christ's sakes.

41:08.787 --> 41:10.207
How are you gonna help her?

41:10.748 --> 41:12.042
Guess I'll have to sort it out,
won't I?

41:12.092 --> 41:13.694
- Martin!
- Look,

41:13.729 --> 41:16.100
I was like a father
to her once, Tony.

41:16.135 --> 41:18.015
And then I left.

41:18.278 --> 41:19.709
If I can't be there for Aiden,

41:19.756 --> 41:22.048
I'm sure I'm gonna show up
for this girl.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.893
(sighs)

41:29.225 --> 41:30.167
You know, there's no way
you're getting

41:30.202 --> 41:32.762
on that train to Paris
without getting busted.

41:33.503 --> 41:35.570
That's why I need your help.

41:37.493 --> 41:42.156

41:45.913 --> 41:47.979
(scoffs)

41:49.433 --> 41:53.804
_

41:54.198 --> 41:56.309
_

41:56.344 --> 41:57.804
MAN:
Uh-huh.

41:59.348 --> 42:02.413
_

42:02.448 --> 42:03.728
MAN: Nah.

42:05.251 --> 42:07.636
_

42:08.414 --> 42:10.398
_

42:12.305 --> 42:13.268
_

42:13.636 --> 42:15.776
_

42:16.338 --> 42:18.486
_

42:19.172 --> 42:22.379
_

42:24.243 --> 42:26.536
_

42:26.727 --> 42:30.057
_

42:41.583 --> 42:43.440
You sure you want
to go through with this?

42:51.773 --> 42:53.485
Watch the bumps, eh?
